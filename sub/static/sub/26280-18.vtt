WEBVTT

00:01.305 --> 00:03.003
Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...

00:03.046 --> 00:04.328
We just published
a few months ago.

00:04.352 --> 00:05.764
How did you have time
to design an experiment?

00:05.788 --> 00:10.097
This whole thing is
actually a gigantic accident.

00:10.140 --> 00:13.013
You weren't even thinking
about super-asymmetry?

00:13.056 --> 00:14.144
Thinking about it?

00:14.188 --> 00:17.408
We don't even understand it.

00:17.452 --> 00:19.149
Can you believe this?

00:19.193 --> 00:20.735
Doctors Pemberton and
Campbell have been doing

00:20.759 --> 00:23.588
a press tour trying to take
credit for super-asymmetry.

00:23.632 --> 00:25.721
So what? I mean, no one's
gonna give them credit

00:25.764 --> 00:27.766
for accidentally
discovering something.

00:27.810 --> 00:28.830
Yeah, who remembers the guy

00:28.854 --> 00:29.986
who was trying to find India

00:30.030 --> 00:31.422
and discovered America instead?

00:31.466 --> 00:33.294
What was his name again?

00:33.337 --> 00:35.296
Now stop trying to steal
our Nobel Prize.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.211
You come up with your own idea.

00:37.254 --> 00:39.213
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

00:41.824 --> 00:43.217
Have a seat,
thanks for being here.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.480
I feel the same way about you.

00:45.523 --> 00:47.047
This is nice.

00:47.090 --> 00:49.788
All my friends hanging out,
watching Ellen.

00:49.832 --> 00:53.836
It's like, what am I gonna do
with my other two wishes?

00:53.879 --> 00:55.838
It's not nice.
She's having on the scientists

00:55.881 --> 00:58.101
who are trying to steal
our Nobel Prize.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.885
Although I will enjoy
watching her expose

00:59.929 --> 01:01.278
Pemberton and Campbell

01:01.322 --> 01:03.933
for the coattail-riding
frauds that they are.

01:03.976 --> 01:06.544
That is Ellen's brand,
gotcha journalism.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.503
Yeah, you should've
seen her take down

01:08.546 --> 01:10.113
John Krasinski last week.

01:10.157 --> 01:13.682
Got him to admit he loved
his wife. It was brutal.

01:13.725 --> 01:15.118
All right, our next guests

01:15.162 --> 01:16.704
are a couple of physicists...
Don't turn the channel.

01:16.728 --> 01:19.253
They've been doing
some viral videos online

01:19.296 --> 01:22.212
about what it's like to be in
the running for a Nobel Prize.

01:22.256 --> 01:24.345
Please welcome
Doctors Greg Pemberton

01:24.388 --> 01:26.042
and Kevin Campbell.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.266
Why does she even want
to have scientists on?

01:32.309 --> 01:34.659
Silly question. Who
else will give her audience

01:34.703 --> 01:37.445
causal explanations of
natural phenomena?

01:37.488 --> 01:40.709
I love you, honey, but think.

01:40.752 --> 01:42.276
So you guys

01:42.319 --> 01:44.713
have discovered something
pretty amazing in the universe.

01:44.756 --> 01:47.150
Obviously, I understand,
high-level physics

01:47.194 --> 01:50.284
because I'm a comedian, but...

01:50.327 --> 01:52.286
can you explain it
to the audience?

01:52.329 --> 01:54.636
Well, I don't know, I'm not
sure we're even smart enough

01:54.679 --> 01:56.203
to understand it.

01:57.769 --> 02:00.555
Look, look, the audience is
laughing at them. It's starting.

02:00.598 --> 02:04.080
I hate to say it, Sheldon, but
I think the audience likes them.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.517
Well, that will all change
when Ellen asks them

02:06.561 --> 02:09.433
how super-asymmetry explains the
cosmological excess of matter

02:09.477 --> 02:11.305
over anti-matter and they panic,

02:11.348 --> 02:14.264
like Leonard trying
to do a pull-up.

02:14.308 --> 02:15.961
Hey, what'd I do?

02:16.005 --> 02:18.747
Not a pull-up.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.190
People have been
loving your videos,

02:20.227 --> 02:22.161
especially the-the songs
that you've been posting.

02:22.185 --> 02:23.491
Thanks. Thank you.

02:23.534 --> 02:26.233
This may be pushing
it, but I have to ask.

02:26.276 --> 02:28.757
Would you mind singing one
of those for us right now?

02:28.800 --> 02:31.194
Why not? All right.

02:31.238 --> 02:34.632
Come on, Ellen, they're right
there. Go for the jugular.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:19.111 --> 03:20.287
Dr. Pemberton.

03:20.330 --> 03:21.723
Dr. Campbell.

03:21.766 --> 03:24.204
Doctors Pemberton and Campbell.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.076
Morning, buddy.

03:27.119 --> 03:28.382
I am not your buddy.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.384
What's wrong? I'll
tell you what's wrong.

03:30.427 --> 03:33.256
You went on TV
and were charming.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.302
Thanks, man.
That's what my mom said.

03:35.345 --> 03:36.781
W-Why don't you come in

03:36.825 --> 03:39.001
and have some parfait? Yeah,

03:39.044 --> 03:41.109
we ordered it from room service;
It cost, like, 12 bucks.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.745
It's just yogurt in a glass.

03:43.788 --> 03:46.138
I don't want your yogurt.

03:46.182 --> 03:47.270
Then what do you want?

03:47.314 --> 03:49.054
I want you to hold
a press conference

03:49.098 --> 03:51.381
where you admit that you blindly
stumbled into super-asymmetry

03:51.405 --> 03:53.233
and it was really our discovery.

03:53.276 --> 03:56.018
No, thanks.

03:57.498 --> 03:59.476
You know, just because we proved
something by accident

03:59.500 --> 04:01.241
doesn't mean we didn't prove it.

04:01.284 --> 04:02.546
Yeah, I wasn't trying

04:02.590 --> 04:04.461
to prove that my wife
was cheating on me

04:04.505 --> 04:05.854
when I came home early
one Friday,

04:05.897 --> 04:08.596
but I'm still sleeping
on his couch.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.206
I told you,
you can do better than her.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.687
Thanks. It just hurts.

04:12.730 --> 04:15.124
And when you win that
Nobel Prize, she's gonna realize

04:15.167 --> 04:16.995
that she was wrong,
you are not a fraud.

04:17.039 --> 04:20.129
She is not wrong.

04:20.172 --> 04:23.306
Wow, I can't believe
you're siding with Linda.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.221
Shame on you.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.140
Look at this. They
posted another video.

04:31.183 --> 04:32.663
It's not even about science.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.317
They're on a celebrity bus tour.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.537
Those are fun. I-I went on one

04:36.580 --> 04:38.539
and saw Tom Hanks talking
to his gardener.

04:38.582 --> 04:41.585
He's even nice when you plant
the wrong color azaleas.

04:43.065 --> 04:44.980
Those guys are good at
self-promoting, so what?

04:45.023 --> 04:47.330
No one ever won a Nobel
for being nice.

04:47.374 --> 04:48.331
Yeah, but if they did,

04:48.375 --> 04:50.028
do you know who would win one?

04:50.072 --> 04:51.943
Are you gonna say Tom Hanks?

04:51.987 --> 04:55.251
He picked up a shovel
and helped the guy replant.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.385
Dr. Cooper,

04:58.428 --> 05:00.101
there you are. I just wanted
to tell you not to worry

05:00.125 --> 05:02.650
about this Pemberton
and Campbell publicity blitz.

05:02.693 --> 05:03.912
Are you worried?

05:03.955 --> 05:05.174
Not at all.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.785
Not even a little bit.

05:07.829 --> 05:10.614
Look, i-it doesn't matter

05:10.658 --> 05:12.660
if they have popular support,

05:12.703 --> 05:15.140
we're gonna get the scientific
community behind us.

05:15.184 --> 05:17.012
He's right, the Nobel Prize
is about the work,

05:17.055 --> 05:19.754
and as your fellow scientists,
we support you and Amy.

05:19.797 --> 05:22.017
That's great, Scooby Gang.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.367
Now, the university
is gonna host

05:24.411 --> 05:26.848
a reception for you
and Dr. Fowler

05:26.891 --> 05:30.155
where we invite as many
academic luminaries as we can,

05:30.199 --> 05:32.810
give them a chance to meet
you, hear about your work.

05:32.854 --> 05:34.769
That's a great idea.Yeah.

05:34.812 --> 05:36.790
Who needs to be likable
when you have Nobel Laureates

05:36.814 --> 05:38.076
campaigning for you?

05:38.120 --> 05:39.034
Yeah... wait a minute.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.949
Do you not think we're likable?

05:40.992 --> 05:42.951
That's what's great about you,

05:42.994 --> 05:45.736
you never stop asking
the tough questions.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.268
Hey. Kids asleep?

05:56.312 --> 05:58.706
Nope. I've been trying
to get them down for hours.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.423
Apparently, Halley's afraid
of the dark now

06:00.447 --> 06:01.554
and I can't turn on
the night-light

06:01.578 --> 06:03.275
'cause it makes Michael cry.

06:03.319 --> 06:04.514
Why doesn't he like
the night-light?

06:04.538 --> 06:06.366
Jot that down, we can ask him

06:06.409 --> 06:09.107
as soon as he learns to speak.

06:09.151 --> 06:13.285
We can also find out what's
so damn funny about birds.

06:15.505 --> 06:17.289
I'll go talk to her.

06:17.333 --> 06:21.076
I don't know why she's suddenly
so afraid of everything.

06:21.119 --> 06:24.296
Honey, remember,
she's my child, too.

06:28.344 --> 06:29.911
Hey, sweetie,

06:29.954 --> 06:31.956
I heard you were afraid
of the dark.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.395
I know someone else
who was afraid of the dark once.

06:35.438 --> 06:37.962
Your daddy,
when he was in space.

06:39.355 --> 06:43.359
And just like you,
I was wearing a full diaper.

06:44.534 --> 06:46.710
Hey, good news.

06:46.754 --> 06:49.409
They're inviting several Nobel
Laureates to our reception.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.323
Great, like who?

06:51.367 --> 06:53.369
Makoto Kobayashi.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.502
Da... ooh.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.721
What?

06:57.765 --> 06:59.351
Well, I may have been
less than kind to him

06:59.375 --> 07:02.291
about his Nobel Prize win.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.423
Why?

07:03.466 --> 07:05.425
I was jealous, angry
and new to Twitter.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.078
It was a dangerous combination.

07:07.122 --> 07:10.255
Okay, so scratch Kobayashi.

07:10.299 --> 07:12.344
George Smoot's on here.

07:14.521 --> 07:17.132
We have a history.

07:17.175 --> 07:19.482
Saul Perlmutter?

07:22.137 --> 07:24.182
What about Kip Thorne?

07:24.226 --> 07:26.097
That was a misunderstanding.

07:26.141 --> 07:27.751
I didn't know
he was right behind me.

07:29.361 --> 07:32.713
So you've alienated everyone
we need to help us?

07:32.756 --> 07:34.976
Well, Amy, if I had known
that someday we'd need them,

07:35.019 --> 07:38.240
I would never
have insulted them.

07:38.283 --> 07:40.111
Well, that doesn't
make it better.

07:40.155 --> 07:43.027
Well, it's also not true.

07:52.602 --> 07:55.213
Hey. Hey.

07:55.257 --> 07:57.389
That's cute.

07:57.433 --> 08:00.001
Did Halley draw that
at preschool?

08:01.524 --> 08:02.873
I drew it.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.222
Well, good night.

08:06.311 --> 08:08.357
It's supposed to be
an astronaut.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.752
And I'm supposed to be
living on my own at this age,

08:11.795 --> 08:15.233
but here we are.

08:15.277 --> 08:18.323
Halley was scared and Howard
told her the sweetest story

08:18.367 --> 08:21.196
about when he was in space
and I thought I could turn it

08:21.239 --> 08:22.980
into a book for her and Michael.

08:23.024 --> 08:25.200
Well, I mean, I am an artist.

08:25.243 --> 08:27.985
I-if you want,
I could do the drawings.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.683
Really? That'd be amazing. Yeah,

08:29.726 --> 08:31.554
it'd be fun. And a,

08:31.598 --> 08:33.991
a nice change of pace
from what I usually draw.

08:34.034 --> 08:35.297
What do you usually draw?

08:35.340 --> 08:36.385
Well, good night.

08:42.477 --> 08:43.871
Someone texting you? No,

08:43.914 --> 08:45.916
I just met my exercise
goal for the day.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.922
By doing the dishes?

08:51.966 --> 08:54.490
Hey, you have your goals,
I have mine.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.581
Hello. What are you two doing?

08:58.625 --> 09:01.279
Just finishing a workout.

09:01.323 --> 09:02.498
What's up?

09:02.542 --> 09:04.195
Do you have any cookie dough?

09:04.239 --> 09:06.937
I think so. Let me see.

09:06.981 --> 09:11.812
Yeah, we've got, chocolate
chip and oatmeal raisin.

09:11.855 --> 09:13.378
Oatmeal raisin?

09:13.422 --> 09:15.555
I know at least two things wrong
with that cookie.

09:17.295 --> 09:18.819
It's for the Nobel Laureates.

09:18.862 --> 09:21.996
We need them on our side,
but unfortunately, Sheldon...

09:22.039 --> 09:25.129
No. "Unfortunately, Sheldon..."
that's all you got to say.

09:25.173 --> 09:27.349
Well, that's... so you need
these people's support

09:27.392 --> 09:28.916
and you're sending
them baked goods?

09:28.959 --> 09:30.395
Yeah, they're pretty smart.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.025
Don't you think they're gonna
realize it's just a bribe?

09:32.049 --> 09:34.443
No, you'd think,
but sometimes brilliant people

09:34.486 --> 09:37.489
can be painfully oblivious
to social cues.

09:40.710 --> 09:43.844
Thank you for pointing
that out, Sheldon.

09:43.887 --> 09:45.497
Anytime.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.723
"Sheldon Cooper"?

09:57.988 --> 09:59.250
"Sheldon Cooper"?

09:59.294 --> 10:02.166
Pass.

10:02.210 --> 10:05.822
"Sheldon Cooper." Aw.

10:05.866 --> 10:08.912
Oatmeal raisin?

10:13.525 --> 10:16.746
It's from Saul Perlmutter.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.008
He sent me a picture.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.531
Ooh, let me see.

10:19.575 --> 10:23.797
He arranged the cookies
to spell out "thank you."

10:24.885 --> 10:27.757
Sheldon, that word
isn't "thank."

10:37.419 --> 10:40.335
Hi. I got you a surprise.

10:40.378 --> 10:43.207
What... What's the occasion?

10:43.251 --> 10:45.253
I heard you tell Halley
that story the other night,

10:45.296 --> 10:46.646
and I thought it was

10:46.689 --> 10:49.736
so sweet that Stuart and I
turned it into a book.

10:49.779 --> 10:54.349
The Frightened Little Astronaut?

10:55.306 --> 10:58.701
That looks just like you.

10:58.745 --> 11:02.574
Look how tiny
and scared you look.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.707
And the best part is,
Stuart showed it

11:04.751 --> 11:06.230
to a publisher friend of his,

11:06.274 --> 11:07.381
and they're interested in it.

11:07.405 --> 11:10.626
That is so cool. Absolutely not.

11:12.149 --> 11:13.368
Why?

11:13.411 --> 11:15.326
Because I don't want
the whole world to know

11:15.370 --> 11:17.677
I was the frightened
little astronaut!

11:21.202 --> 11:24.466
Maybe you should've called it
The Bitchy Little Astronaut.

11:28.862 --> 11:31.255
You want to tell me
what's going on?

11:31.299 --> 11:33.214
Is my distress that obvious?

11:33.257 --> 11:35.259
Sheldon, please don't
take this the wrong way,

11:35.303 --> 11:36.846
but when you're quiet
even for a second,

11:36.870 --> 11:38.828
something's wrong.

11:38.872 --> 11:41.048
Well, it's true.

11:41.091 --> 11:43.659
The fact is, I feel
really bad for Amy.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.965
Well, we all do.

11:45.008 --> 11:47.663
But just for fun, why do you?

11:47.707 --> 11:50.231
Well, she didn't
do anything wrong,

11:50.274 --> 11:53.408
but she's paying for my mistakes.
Wow.

11:53.451 --> 11:55.018
What?

11:55.062 --> 11:57.760
No... I'm just
honestly impressed.

11:57.804 --> 12:00.937
When did you start caring
about other people's feelings?

12:00.981 --> 12:03.418
Well, I laughed when Amy
got a shock from

12:03.461 --> 12:06.421
the broken Christmas tree
lights, so it was after that.

12:08.553 --> 12:11.731
So none of them are
coming to the reception?

12:11.774 --> 12:13.384
I don't think so.

12:13.428 --> 12:16.605
Okay, what did he say
that was so insulting? Well,

12:16.648 --> 12:18.781
he may have suggested there was

12:18.825 --> 12:22.742
an inelegance to the quadrupole
normalization of Smoot's data.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.787
Damn.

12:27.921 --> 12:30.314
See, sometimes I wish I could
invent a time machine,

12:30.358 --> 12:32.360
so I could go back
and prevent myself

12:32.403 --> 12:33.927
from acting so rashly.

12:33.970 --> 12:37.539
Or moving forward, you could
think before you speak.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.759
I suppose so.

12:39.802 --> 12:43.501
But the time machine thing
is probably more likely.

12:43.545 --> 12:46.635
My problem is that
I don't always know

12:46.678 --> 12:48.593
when I've gone too far.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.900
Well, if you like,
I could try to help you out.

12:50.944 --> 12:54.121
You know, and maybe let you know
if you're crossing a line.

12:54.164 --> 12:57.124
You mean, like, with a code word?
Sure.

12:57.167 --> 12:59.735
How's "shut up"?

13:01.171 --> 13:03.217
That's perfect. People
say it to me all the time,

13:03.260 --> 13:04.479
no one will suspect.

13:08.048 --> 13:10.659
Hey, got a minute? Sure. What's up?

13:10.702 --> 13:12.835
Bernadette said

13:12.879 --> 13:14.445
you weren't crazy
about the book.

13:14.489 --> 13:15.838
No. It's great.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.448
I just don't want anyone
to ever see it

13:17.492 --> 13:19.276
or read it or know it exists.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.844
But this could be
really good for me,

13:21.888 --> 13:24.455
you know? Finally get
my artwork published.

13:24.499 --> 13:27.371
And-and come on,
it's a, it's a cute story.

13:27.415 --> 13:28.459
Easy for you to say.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.505
No one's gonna think
you're a coward.

13:30.548 --> 13:32.681
Are you kidding? The other day

13:32.724 --> 13:35.597
in the comic book store,
a balloon popped and I threw up.

13:38.905 --> 13:41.472
Can't you just
take my name off it?

13:41.516 --> 13:44.475
No, the only reason
the publisher's interested

13:44.519 --> 13:46.782
is 'cause a real astronaut
wrote it.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.046
Well, look, what if
we made a few changes?

13:50.090 --> 13:51.874
Sure, yes.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.355
What-what do you have in mind?
Well, nothing major.

13:54.398 --> 13:55.680
But see here on the
cover, where it says

13:55.704 --> 13:57.706
"frightened little,"
what if, I don't know,

13:57.749 --> 14:00.840
it didn't say that?

14:00.883 --> 14:04.452
So, it would just be The Astronaut?

14:04.495 --> 14:06.758
Yeah, you're right.
That doesn't quite pop.

14:06.802 --> 14:10.327
What about...
The Brave Astronaut?

14:10.371 --> 14:12.764
See, that's got some zip to it!

14:13.809 --> 14:15.419
Okay.

14:15.463 --> 14:18.074
And here on this page,
where I'm crying.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.729
What if, instead,
I'm... punching a meteor

14:20.772 --> 14:24.254
into the sun with my bare fists?

14:24.298 --> 14:26.213
So you have superpowers?

14:26.256 --> 14:29.085
I like the way you're thinking.

14:31.740 --> 14:34.047
Professor Thorne?

14:34.090 --> 14:35.222
Dr. Hofstadter.

14:35.265 --> 14:36.832
You know my wife, Penny.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.312
Hi.

14:38.355 --> 14:41.097
We wanted to talk to you
about Dr. Cooper.

14:41.141 --> 14:42.316
Now, before you say no...

14:42.359 --> 14:43.491
No.

14:45.493 --> 14:46.973
Well, then, after you say no.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.539
No.

14:48.583 --> 14:51.325
Okay, look, Sheldon's
a pain in the ass.

14:51.368 --> 14:52.979
But Dr. Fowler's really nice.

14:53.022 --> 14:56.286
So if you average
them out... math...

14:57.592 --> 14:58.941
you got someone who's okay.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.160
But more

15:00.203 --> 15:02.771
than the person,
the Nobel is about the work.

15:02.814 --> 15:04.314
You should understand that
more than anyone.

15:04.338 --> 15:06.644
Yes, because of your work
on gravitational waves.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.037
You know my work?

15:08.081 --> 15:10.344
I do. But I'm-I'm really
hogging this conversation.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.128
Leonard?

15:12.172 --> 15:13.564
Just give them a chance.

15:13.608 --> 15:16.350
Science has a history
of difficult people.

15:16.393 --> 15:17.917
Look at, Newton, who was

15:17.960 --> 15:20.528
a jerk to Leibniz, and Leibniz,
who was a jerk to everyone.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.617
Yeah, you know, and I
don't need to tell you

15:22.660 --> 15:24.619
that gravitational waves
are disturbances

15:24.662 --> 15:26.403
in the curvature of space-time.

15:26.447 --> 15:29.624
Or that the... Hey, you worked
on the movie Interstellar?

15:35.586 --> 15:37.110
So what do you think?

15:37.153 --> 15:38.981
I think if you were in space

15:39.025 --> 15:42.245
without a shirt on, you'd die.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.683
No, I am wearing a shirt.

15:45.727 --> 15:49.470
It's just skintight,
so you can see my pecs.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.689
When did you get pecs?

15:51.733 --> 15:55.650
Yesterday, when I made
Stuart add them.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.695
Howie, what I liked
about the other story

15:57.739 --> 15:59.088
was that it was real.

15:59.132 --> 16:01.699
I mean, nothing in this
actually happened to you.

16:01.743 --> 16:04.137
So, it's a children's book.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.834
I mean, cats don't wear hats.

16:05.877 --> 16:07.662
And if someone gives you
green eggs, it ends

16:07.705 --> 16:10.404
with you on the toilet
trying to make a deal with God.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.582
But the real story was so sweet.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.714
The little astronaut was afraid,

16:16.758 --> 16:19.078
but he still went to space,
and that's what made him brave.

16:19.108 --> 16:23.243
But in space,
the other astronauts...

16:23.286 --> 16:25.549
made fun of him,
and that's a thing

16:25.593 --> 16:27.682
he doesn't want to relive.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.379
I get that.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.340
I guess it would
just take a really

16:33.383 --> 16:35.516
brave man to put an embarrassing
story like that

16:35.559 --> 16:37.866
out into the world,
just so it might help

16:37.909 --> 16:40.347
some frightened children
not feel so alone.

16:40.390 --> 16:44.220
Wow. That is
quite the guilt trip.

16:46.527 --> 16:49.051
Are you sure you're not Jewish?

16:52.620 --> 16:55.492
I'm just a wife that is
so proud of her husband,

16:55.536 --> 16:56.904
and doesn't think
that he has anything

16:56.928 --> 16:59.061
to be embarrassed about.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.803
You're sounding
less and less Jewish.

17:04.327 --> 17:06.547
Hey, we just heard that
you're the ones

17:06.589 --> 17:08.417
who convinced
the Nobel Laureates to come.

17:08.462 --> 17:09.419
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

17:09.463 --> 17:10.420
You guys deserve this.

17:10.464 --> 17:11.551
Yeah, now get out of here,

17:11.595 --> 17:12.814
go talk to some smart people.

17:13.771 --> 17:16.773
Wait a minute. Yeah, sorry.
Sometimes I forget

17:16.818 --> 17:19.212
you're smart because
you're so sexy.

17:19.255 --> 17:22.606
I can see that.Yeah.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.130
Dr. Cooper. Dr. Fowler.

17:24.173 --> 17:26.696
I was just telling Professor
Arnold how you came up with

17:26.741 --> 17:28.482
super-asymmetry at your wedding.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.658
It's a wonderful story.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.138
Ha, it really is.

17:32.181 --> 17:33.941
I wouldn't say it was the
highlight of the wedding,

17:33.965 --> 17:35.706
because I've been told not to

17:35.750 --> 17:38.100
for reasons I don't
fully understand.

17:38.144 --> 17:40.537
But what he does understand
is how the universe works,

17:40.581 --> 17:41.756
and that's what's important.

17:41.799 --> 17:44.498
Not what comes out of his mouth.

17:49.024 --> 17:50.784
I haven't been to a lot of
parties like this,

17:50.808 --> 17:54.812
but what does a physics
rumble look like?

17:54.856 --> 17:56.727
Kind of like angry chickens.

17:56.771 --> 18:00.688
Or-or-or-or like,
when-when puppets fight.

18:00.731 --> 18:03.734
Dr. Cooper, Dr. Fowler,
good to see you.

18:03.778 --> 18:04.909
What are you doing here?

18:04.953 --> 18:06.476
Professor Smoot invited us.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.087
We're Facebook friends. Smooty!

18:10.785 --> 18:13.570
Well, this is our
reception, so go away.

18:13.614 --> 18:14.615
Actually, Amy,

18:14.658 --> 18:16.312
I think we should let them stay.

18:16.356 --> 18:17.835
Please, enjoy yourselves.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.750
Try some pigs in blankets.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.796
And yes, that is the plural.

18:21.839 --> 18:23.406
Great.Thanks.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.017
What are you doing?

18:26.061 --> 18:27.671
If they stay, everyone will see

18:27.715 --> 18:28.996
that their grasp
on super-asymmetry

18:29.020 --> 18:30.152
is tenuous at best.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.589
That's clever.

18:32.633 --> 18:35.026
Yeah, I don't just know
the plurals of things, Amy.

18:36.419 --> 18:37.681
Is this gonna be a problem?

18:37.725 --> 18:39.944
No, no, no. We have a plan.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.555
Dr. Campbell and Pemberton,

18:41.598 --> 18:43.861
settle a bet for
Dr. Fowler and me?

18:43.905 --> 18:45.950
We were just discussing,
under what conditions

18:45.994 --> 18:48.127
the radiative corrections
to super-asymmetry

18:48.170 --> 18:50.346
could cause time
variation of alpha E.M.?

18:50.390 --> 18:54.176
I say active galactic nuclei
at cosmological distances

18:54.220 --> 18:55.786
show a part per
million deviation.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.310
Dr. Cooper says

18:57.353 --> 19:00.356
this has been disproven recently
with quasar observations.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.618
What do youthink?

19:06.797 --> 19:08.190
I agree with you.

19:10.801 --> 19:11.976
Good answer.

19:13.326 --> 19:14.718
Hey, if we haven't
said it before,

19:14.762 --> 19:17.765
we just want to say...
thank you.

19:17.808 --> 19:20.376
Yeah. We couldn't have proven
super-asymmetry without you.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.117
Wait-wait. You all
heard them say it.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.423
They didn't do anything.

19:24.641 --> 19:27.166
Sheldon. Shut up. Yeah...
Well, that's rude.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.776
No. Shut up.

19:28.819 --> 19:31.779
The code word, thank you.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.278
You know, it's strange.
A few months ago,

19:33.302 --> 19:34.758
nobody paid any attention to us,
and now all of a sudden,

19:34.782 --> 19:36.392
we're getting all
these accolades.

19:36.436 --> 19:38.133
Yeah, have-have any
of you ever felt like

19:38.177 --> 19:39.613
maybe you didn't deserve it?

19:39.656 --> 19:41.243
Leonard, there's
something I need to say.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.747
Shut up.Okay.

19:43.791 --> 19:46.576
It's crazy. We conclusively
proved super-asymmetry,

19:46.620 --> 19:49.579
and yet somehow we,
we still feel like imposters.

19:49.623 --> 19:51.146
There should be a term for that.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.714
For crying out loud,
there isa term for that!

19:53.757 --> 19:55.890
It's called "imposter syndrome"

19:55.933 --> 19:57.500
and you don't have it!

19:57.544 --> 19:59.130
Because you can't have it
if you areimposters,

19:59.154 --> 20:00.286
and you are!

20:00.329 --> 20:02.157
We're the ones

20:02.201 --> 20:03.221
who discovered super-asymmetry!

20:03.245 --> 20:04.353
So if anyone's gonna feel like

20:04.377 --> 20:05.813
they have imposter syndrome,

20:05.856 --> 20:09.382
it's us, because we're not
imposters! Theyare!

20:09.425 --> 20:12.211
You're imposters
and you're frauds!

20:18.217 --> 20:20.175
Is that what I would've
sounded like? Yeah.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.959
Yikes!

20:29.053 --> 20:31.795
"Once upon a time,
there was a little astronaut

20:31.839 --> 20:34.842
who was sitting in a rocket
waiting to go to space."

20:34.885 --> 20:36.278
Three... two... one...

20:36.322 --> 20:38.149
And while all
the other astronauts

20:38.193 --> 20:41.022
laughed and joked,
he stayed quiet,

20:41.065 --> 20:42.545
because he had a secret.

20:42.589 --> 20:46.201
He was scared.
He had another secret, too.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.813
He was only pretending to be
scared to trick the alien king.

20:49.857 --> 20:51.772
Ha-ha!

20:52.860 --> 20:53.861
Howie.

20:54.949 --> 20:56.342
Fine.

20:56.385 --> 20:58.692
There was no alien.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.436
There was a bossy wife, though.
We'll get to her later.
