03:31.823 --> 03:32.823
- Lily.

03:54.769 --> 03:55.913
- The highest casualty rate

03:55.914 --> 03:57.621
in the British forces.

03:57.622 --> 04:01.075
More than 1 in 10 killed or wounded.

04:01.076 --> 04:03.701
They called it the Heart of Darkness.

04:03.702 --> 04:07.206
Taliban country along the river...

04:48.017 --> 04:49.376
- Dad was wondering if you were gonna help

04:49.377 --> 04:50.877
while you're back.

04:53.596 --> 04:55.679
- Did he ask that or are you?

05:01.059 --> 05:05.218
- I just thought he'd
appreciate the gesture

05:08.646 --> 05:12.146
that you could try working together again.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.470
- Smoking now?

06:04.935 --> 06:07.602
- Say hello to him from me.

06:26.338 --> 06:27.723
- Where is he?

06:27.724 --> 06:29.974
- He said to give you this.

06:33.895 --> 06:35.395
What does it mean?

06:56.477 --> 06:57.477
- Sam?

07:00.478 --> 07:01.478
Sam!

07:44.797 --> 07:46.714
Did you think about me?

07:49.701 --> 07:50.951
- All the time.

07:53.246 --> 07:54.246
- Liar.

09:10.785 --> 09:12.035
- What is it?

09:53.458 --> 09:56.708
- Sam!

09:58.619 --> 09:59.619
Sam!

10:17.965 --> 10:18.965
Sam?

10:26.042 --> 10:27.042
Hey.

10:40.086 --> 10:41.169
What's wrong?

10:45.197 --> 10:46.530
- Are you happy?

10:48.253 --> 10:49.253
- What?

10:52.843 --> 10:53.843
- With me.

10:55.043 --> 10:56.043
What I do.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.409
- Of course I am.

11:02.296 --> 11:04.379
I couldn't be more proud.

11:24.409 --> 11:27.076
- I lost a mate a few weeks ago.

11:28.663 --> 11:30.580
Adam, a lad from Stoke.

11:34.590 --> 11:38.516
We were on patrol and
we started taking fire.

11:38.517 --> 11:41.600
So we took cover in a drainage ditch.

11:45.050 --> 11:47.800
This boy appeared out of nowhere,

11:49.816 --> 11:52.983
couldn't have been more than about 10.

11:54.197 --> 11:58.364
There was a moment when we
just stared at each other.

11:59.418 --> 12:00.918
And then he fired.

12:03.542 --> 12:06.564
Adam returned and I watched

12:06.565 --> 12:08.648
this boy's chest explode.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.564
Surrounded by this red mist.

12:17.094 --> 12:18.761
And then he dropped.

12:22.298 --> 12:23.631
But so did Adam.

12:28.605 --> 12:30.688
I tried calling for help.

12:32.361 --> 12:34.944
I tried to apply some pressure.

12:40.672 --> 12:43.589
I'm not sure I can do it anymore.

13:26.778 --> 13:29.361
- You looking for something?

13:29.972 --> 13:30.972
- No.

13:35.954 --> 13:38.496
- You're Brookwell's lad.

13:38.497 --> 13:39.497
The soldier.

13:42.150 --> 13:44.416
Must be an interesting profession,

13:44.417 --> 13:47.500
shooting ragheads out in the desert.

13:48.695 --> 13:51.978
Suppose you do a lot
poking around out there,

13:51.979 --> 13:54.637
snooping around, sniffing out muzzies

13:54.638 --> 13:56.405
in whatever holes they've crawled into

13:56.406 --> 13:59.396
but it doesn't work like that back here.

13:59.397 --> 14:01.647
You ought to remember that.

14:04.728 --> 14:06.478
The road is that way.

14:42.886 --> 14:44.886
- Got some post for you.

15:53.783 --> 15:56.616
- Do you think he's killed anyone?

16:01.168 --> 16:04.460
Because it's likely, isn't it?

16:04.461 --> 16:06.711
I mean that's what they do.

16:09.488 --> 16:12.233
- Most combat happens from a distance.

16:12.234 --> 16:14.465
- Did he tell you that?

16:14.466 --> 16:15.466
- I read it.

16:20.495 --> 16:23.995
- It would change you though, wouldn't it?

16:28.949 --> 16:30.531
- What?

16:30.532 --> 16:32.032
- Killing someone.

17:01.700 --> 17:04.315
- That heifer's due tonight.

17:04.316 --> 17:07.733
I want you checking her every 20 minutes.

17:43.831 --> 17:45.581
- Let's do something.

17:49.421 --> 17:50.838
- I have to work.

17:55.613 --> 17:56.613
- All day?

18:08.293 --> 18:09.674
Other thing?

18:09.675 --> 18:11.123
What other thing?

18:11.124 --> 18:12.124
Tell me!

18:25.685 --> 18:28.518
I wish you didn't have to go back.

18:40.917 --> 18:41.917
I worry.

18:46.104 --> 18:47.437
- You shouldn't.

19:08.717 --> 19:10.575
I should go back.

19:10.576 --> 19:11.576
- Not yet.

19:12.393 --> 19:13.893
Stay a bit longer.

19:18.542 --> 19:19.542
Please?

19:30.004 --> 19:32.541
- Don't you
turn your back on me.

19:32.542 --> 19:34.068
If you don't give a damn

19:34.069 --> 19:35.848
then what are you doing back here?

19:35.849 --> 19:37.466
I didn't ask for your help!

19:37.467 --> 19:39.177
- I'm sorry.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.738
- You're not sorry.

19:41.739 --> 19:43.469
You know what your problem is?

19:43.470 --> 19:45.337
You're selfish.

19:45.338 --> 19:47.207
That's right, go on.

19:47.208 --> 19:48.416
Back to the army.
- Sam, stop.

19:48.417 --> 19:50.782
He doesn't mean it.

19:50.783 --> 19:51.783
- Sam.

19:52.720 --> 19:53.720
Sam, wait!

19:55.540 --> 19:57.373
Talk to me!
- Get off.

20:37.556 --> 20:38.556
- You okay?

21:02.185 --> 21:04.298
- A nice little project for me, you know,

21:04.299 --> 21:06.083
something to keep me busy.

21:06.084 --> 21:08.474
Never thought it'd be this difficult.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.035
If I come and have a look at the options

21:10.036 --> 21:12.096
laid out before me here I can

21:12.097 --> 21:15.834
get some ideas, refocus and
make some firm decisions.

21:15.835 --> 21:17.427
- Well I think we can help.

21:17.428 --> 21:19.059
Have a look at that.

21:19.060 --> 21:21.291
- Get the fuck out of here.

21:21.292 --> 21:23.728
- I suppose this is why
people get designers in.

21:23.729 --> 21:25.068
- I'm really sorry, could you hold on

21:25.069 --> 21:26.736
for just one minute?

21:30.693 --> 21:32.215
What's going on?

21:32.216 --> 21:33.790
- I should have you arrested.

21:33.791 --> 21:36.458
- Sure, you call the police.

21:36.459 --> 21:39.542
- Stewart, you're needed back inside.

21:43.550 --> 21:44.670
- What's going on?

21:44.671 --> 21:46.995
- Harlequin Jones.

21:46.996 --> 21:50.555
- I'm really sorry about that, Mr. Jones.

21:50.556 --> 21:53.973
Is there something I could help you with?

22:03.794 --> 22:05.217
What did he want?

22:05.218 --> 22:07.301
- Wanted to replace this.

22:14.583 --> 22:15.777
- Do you think he did it?

22:15.778 --> 22:16.611
- What?

22:16.612 --> 22:17.715
Shot his wife?

22:17.716 --> 22:19.649
- Everyone says he did.

22:19.650 --> 22:22.076
- Don't you think he would've
been locked up by now?

22:22.077 --> 22:23.617
- But she used his gun.

22:23.618 --> 22:25.785
- I doubt she had her own.

23:47.577 --> 23:49.790
- So, when will they let you know?

23:49.791 --> 23:51.498
- Thank you.

23:51.499 --> 23:53.081
I'm not sure.

23:53.082 --> 23:55.009
Whenever they make a decision I suppose.

23:55.010 --> 23:56.643
- And they pay you for that, do they?

23:56.644 --> 23:58.346
Sitting around doing nothing?

23:58.347 --> 24:00.425
Now I know where my tax is going.

24:00.426 --> 24:03.290
I mean, shouldn't you be
training or something?

24:03.291 --> 24:05.224
- He's on mid-tour leave.

24:05.225 --> 24:08.080
Everyone's entitled to some time off,

24:08.081 --> 24:10.748
especially after what he's done.

24:11.930 --> 24:14.218
- Where was it you were fighting again?

24:14.219 --> 24:18.219
- Nahre Saraj, North
district, Helmand Province.

24:19.615 --> 24:20.558
- Afghanistan?

24:20.558 --> 24:21.558
- Yeah.

24:22.487 --> 24:23.487
Afghanistan.

24:27.514 --> 24:30.514
- Shall we change the subject?

24:31.615 --> 24:34.571
- Why don't you tell us a
bit about your work, Stew?

24:34.572 --> 24:36.946
What is it you were doing before us?

24:36.947 --> 24:38.292
Plastics, wasn't it?

24:38.293 --> 24:40.769
- Yeah, injection moulding.

24:40.770 --> 24:42.166
At the unit just outside of town.

24:42.167 --> 24:44.297
- Yeah, that's it.

24:44.298 --> 24:47.083
Make all sorts of interesting
things out there, don't they?

24:47.084 --> 24:49.252
Really useful Stuff, bottle tops and...

24:49.253 --> 24:50.253
- Lily...

24:55.140 --> 24:58.057
- What about Harlequin Jones, Stew?

25:00.040 --> 25:01.745
What's going on between you two?

25:01.746 --> 25:02.746
- Lily.

25:03.986 --> 25:06.215
- He tried to get me locked up once.

25:07.198 --> 25:11.365
I like do a bit of
shooting, you know lamping.

25:11.447 --> 25:12.780
At night mainly.

25:14.278 --> 25:16.771
Old Jonesey got it into his
head that I'd been poaching.

25:16.871 --> 25:18.227
- Poaching what?

25:18.335 --> 25:19.806
- Deer.

25:19.807 --> 25:21.965
Lot of money in it if
you can get rid of it.

25:21.966 --> 25:23.219
- And did you?

25:23.327 --> 25:25.327
- What?
- Poach his deer.

25:27.385 --> 25:29.692
- That bloke is a murderer, shot his wife.

25:29.693 --> 25:31.050
- It was suicide.

25:31.051 --> 25:33.963
- What, with his gun in
the forest he manages?

25:34.798 --> 25:36.964
Did I say something funny?

25:39.337 --> 25:40.907
- You think he shot her?

25:40.908 --> 25:41.991
- Yeah, I do.

25:45.008 --> 25:48.967
Yeah, well, I suppose it's
no big deal for you, is it?

25:48.968 --> 25:50.896
Must happen a few times a day out there,

25:50.897 --> 25:53.647
all part of the job, the routine.

26:07.587 --> 26:09.464
- A brand new fitted kitchen and bathroom

26:09.465 --> 26:11.821
with double glazing.

26:11.822 --> 26:15.679
Living area there, bedroom
one, and bedroom two.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.155
I have had a few inquiries
already about the property,

26:18.156 --> 26:20.605
so if you are serious I'd encourage you to

26:20.606 --> 26:22.805
put a deposit down as soon as possible.

26:22.806 --> 26:24.631
I'll give you a few minutes
to have a look around.

26:24.632 --> 26:26.215
- Thank you.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.688
- How much is the deposit?

26:35.689 --> 26:36.939
- Not too much.

26:41.263 --> 26:42.763
Don't you like it?

26:44.161 --> 26:45.661
- Nah, it's great.

26:50.020 --> 26:53.380
- I don't want you to worry about it.

26:53.381 --> 26:54.964
I'll sort it, okay?

27:05.695 --> 27:07.908
Rachel said your barracks
called yesterday,

27:07.909 --> 27:10.133
Sergeant something or other.

27:10.216 --> 27:11.379
- What did he want?

27:11.412 --> 27:12.612
- Didn't say.

27:12.670 --> 27:14.504
Just that he wanted to speak to you.

27:18.487 --> 27:20.154
- Let's go upstairs.

27:29.186 --> 27:31.686
- Ow, Sam, what are you doing?

27:46.360 --> 27:47.360
- Shh!

28:25.932 --> 28:26.932
Lily!

28:31.576 --> 28:32.609
- Lil, let me explain.

28:34.373 --> 28:35.458
Lily, talk to me.

28:35.499 --> 28:38.082
- I have nothing to say to you.

28:43.028 --> 28:44.028
- Please, Lily...

28:49.484 --> 28:50.921
Let me in.

29:17.237 --> 29:21.320
When I got back from tour
I wasn't feeling great.

29:22.804 --> 29:26.054
Trouble sleeping and having nightmares.

29:28.139 --> 29:30.176
So I went to see a doctor
and he gave me some pills

29:30.177 --> 29:32.594
and they helped calm me down.

29:38.312 --> 29:40.812
But I still didn't feel right.

29:45.291 --> 29:48.541
When I came home I stopped taking them.

29:50.699 --> 29:54.866
Something about being
here and being with you,

29:54.971 --> 29:56.638
Felt normal again.

30:00.579 --> 30:01.912
Like it used to.

30:08.189 --> 30:12.356
But I know that if I'm
here and I'm with you

30:12.418 --> 30:13.835
I can get better.

30:17.129 --> 30:20.046
But I won't to go back there Lil.

30:29.269 --> 30:31.769
- And if they find you?

30:33.769 --> 30:36.842
- They'll send me to a
corrective training facility

30:36.851 --> 30:38.493
or lock me up.

30:52.846 --> 30:53.929
Please Lil.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.242
- Where is he?

31:52.223 --> 31:53.223
- At home.

31:54.160 --> 31:57.368
- You tell him that the police
had been up at the farm.

31:57.369 --> 32:01.536
They want to know why his
unit is back in Afghanistan

32:01.673 --> 32:03.076
and he's not.

32:03.077 --> 32:03.945
- Hello, Harry.

32:03.946 --> 32:05.174
Is everything okay?

32:05.175 --> 32:07.144
- It was your Tim that filled his head

32:07.145 --> 32:10.045
full of this army nonsense.

32:10.046 --> 32:13.755
You tell him that if
doesn't give himself in

32:13.756 --> 32:16.173
I'll come and get him myself.

32:26.632 --> 32:29.269
- You have to go speak to them, Sam.

32:29.270 --> 32:31.811
Get this mess cleared up.

32:31.812 --> 32:34.093
They must have made a
mistake or something.

32:34.094 --> 32:36.923
- He's a runaway.

32:36.924 --> 32:37.924
Deserter.

32:41.504 --> 32:42.567
- No.

32:42.568 --> 32:45.023
No, you've got a responsibility.

32:45.024 --> 32:47.024
You can't just run away.

32:48.089 --> 32:50.006
What is wrong with you?

32:51.822 --> 32:54.390
- She asked you a question.

32:54.391 --> 32:56.308
What is wrong with you?

32:57.155 --> 32:59.262
Can't you hack it?

32:59.537 --> 33:01.537
Easier to run away?

33:02.601 --> 33:04.434
Easier being a coward?

33:17.911 --> 33:18.994
- Lily, wait.

33:19.938 --> 33:21.597
Lily!
- Get off of me.

33:21.598 --> 33:23.366
- Lily, talk to me!

33:23.367 --> 33:24.974
- I can't even look at you right now.

33:24.975 --> 33:25.975
- I'm sorry.

33:26.827 --> 33:28.910
- What were you thinking?

33:34.163 --> 33:36.413
What the fuck do we do now?

33:38.514 --> 33:40.014
- I could go away.

33:40.914 --> 33:43.331
Wait for things to blow over.

33:45.985 --> 33:47.568
- That's your plan?

33:50.600 --> 33:51.850
Run away again?

33:56.275 --> 33:57.275
- I'm sorry.

34:02.683 --> 34:05.497
I'll think of something.

34:05.498 --> 34:07.081
I'll figure it out.

34:38.092 --> 34:39.925
- We can clear it out.

34:41.155 --> 34:42.822
Bring some stuff in.

34:48.413 --> 34:50.830
It's a stupid idea, isn't it?

34:51.882 --> 34:52.882
- Maybe.

34:55.716 --> 34:57.299
I have slept in it.

35:02.174 --> 35:06.341
We could go and get some tools
and my stuff from the farm.

35:10.990 --> 35:12.573
- It'll have to do.

35:49.299 --> 35:51.401
When you went to the doctor,

35:51.402 --> 35:55.166
did you tell him that you were unhappy?

35:55.167 --> 35:58.000
That you were thinking of leaving?

35:59.389 --> 36:01.069
- People don't like you talking like that.

36:01.130 --> 36:02.704
- But what if you want to leave?

36:02.705 --> 36:03.705
- I can't.

36:05.713 --> 36:07.066
I still have at least another year left

36:07.067 --> 36:09.317
before I can give any notice.

36:10.241 --> 36:13.491
- There must be someone we can talk to.

36:14.619 --> 36:17.119
- My commanding officer maybe.

36:18.797 --> 36:22.297
But he's not gonna waste any time with me.

36:25.651 --> 36:29.818
If I lay low for long
enough, it'll all blow over.

36:31.984 --> 36:33.053
They're not gonna spend much time

36:33.054 --> 36:35.721
looking for one soldier like me.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.181
Not that I don't enjoy them,

36:46.182 --> 36:47.729
but maybe tomorrow we could have something

36:47.730 --> 36:49.980
more nourishing for dinner.

37:40.489 --> 37:43.066
- I'm gonna head to the shop.

37:43.067 --> 37:44.817
Do you want anything?

39:21.988 --> 39:22.988
Sam?

39:26.518 --> 39:28.101
Didn't you hear me?

39:53.615 --> 39:54.948
- I can't sleep.

40:06.989 --> 40:08.739
What if they find me?

40:12.620 --> 40:14.203
- I won't let them.

40:24.054 --> 40:26.221
Are these even gonna work?

40:28.882 --> 40:31.210
You know, I can just buy us food.

40:31.211 --> 40:33.128
- That's not the point.

40:39.945 --> 40:40.945
Here we go.

40:43.834 --> 40:44.834
Easy.

42:33.730 --> 42:36.647
- Sam, could you help me with this?

42:37.855 --> 42:38.855
Sam?

42:41.819 --> 42:42.902
Can you help?

43:03.039 --> 43:06.122
Harlequin's been removing the snares.

43:07.561 --> 43:10.311
- How do you know it's Harlequin?

43:11.689 --> 43:14.272
- I've been watching him.

43:18.349 --> 43:20.937
- What if he sees you?

43:20.938 --> 43:21.938
- He won't.

44:19.077 --> 44:20.077
- Harlequin?

44:25.667 --> 44:26.667
Harlequin.

45:14.073 --> 45:15.138
- What are you doing?

45:15.139 --> 45:17.674
- Where's your phone?

45:17.724 --> 45:18.974
- It's at home.

45:21.042 --> 45:22.042
- At home?

45:24.263 --> 45:25.346
Are you sure?

45:26.474 --> 45:27.474
- Yes.

45:32.140 --> 45:33.140
- Good.

45:34.249 --> 45:35.691
Because they can track us with us.

45:35.692 --> 45:38.458
They can triangulate the
signal or something, so.

45:43.930 --> 45:45.720
- Where are you going?
- To check if they've gone.

45:45.721 --> 45:46.721
- Who?

47:34.407 --> 47:35.407
- Hello?

49:37.095 --> 49:39.801
- You're fuckin' insane, Jones!

49:41.351 --> 49:44.768
- I can see you, you bastard.

49:46.128 --> 49:47.378
Run you coward.

49:51.284 --> 49:53.796
I'll find you and I'll fucking kill you.

50:04.851 --> 50:06.018
- Shoot!

50:09.621 --> 50:10.788
Shoot him now!

50:15.788 --> 50:16.788
Shoot!

50:22.427 --> 50:23.594
Shoot him now!

50:38.535 --> 50:39.535
- Sam?

50:44.442 --> 50:45.442
Sam?

51:09.999 --> 51:10.991
Hey.

51:10.999 --> 51:12.116
Hey Sam.

51:12.134 --> 51:13.282
Hey.

51:13.315 --> 51:14.398
Sam, wake up.

51:15.382 --> 51:16.382
Hey.

51:17.333 --> 51:18.500
Hey, you okay?

51:55.317 --> 51:57.734
Maybe you should see someone.

52:01.212 --> 52:02.212
- Who?

52:03.261 --> 52:06.780
- I was thinking maybe
we could go to a walk in,

52:07.180 --> 52:10.097
somewhere they won't recognise you.

52:20.787 --> 52:22.093
What are you doing?

52:22.102 --> 52:23.488
- I need to check something.

52:23.504 --> 52:24.796
- No, you need to rest.

52:24.813 --> 52:25.813
- Stop it.

52:30.075 --> 52:32.908
- I'll come with you.
- Stay here.

55:27.876 --> 55:29.793
- Where'd you get that?

55:48.678 --> 55:49.761
- Here.

55:53.492 --> 55:54.492
- What?

55:55.515 --> 55:56.515
- You do it.

56:00.921 --> 56:01.921
- No.

56:12.114 --> 56:14.281
- Push the blade in there.

56:18.565 --> 56:19.732
- No, I won't.

56:25.081 --> 56:26.533
- Go on.

56:26.534 --> 56:27.701
- Please, Sam.

56:29.191 --> 56:30.524
I don't want to.

56:39.189 --> 56:40.189
Do it!

57:25.259 --> 57:27.036
- Lily, it's me.

57:27.053 --> 57:29.103
The police have been around again.

57:29.111 --> 57:31.398
I know you're just trying
to do what's right but

57:31.399 --> 57:32.399
let me help.

57:34.032 --> 57:35.422
Stewart's gone.

57:35.423 --> 57:36.673
He's taken off.

57:37.785 --> 57:39.702
I wish you'd come home.

57:49.828 --> 57:52.556
- Just seen the work
van hidden in the woods.

57:52.557 --> 57:55.210
Apparently Stewart took off with it.

57:55.343 --> 57:57.510
- I saw him the other day.

57:59.315 --> 58:02.148
Snooping around Harlequin's lorry.

58:02.997 --> 58:04.754
- Doing what?

58:04.770 --> 58:06.020
- I don't know.

58:07.091 --> 58:09.088
- What were you doing there?

58:09.138 --> 58:10.138
- Snooping.

58:23.780 --> 58:26.363
How did you know about Stewart.

58:32.636 --> 58:36.719
You just said Stewart took
off with the work van.

58:37.664 --> 58:39.081
How did you know?

58:46.730 --> 58:48.063
Lily, the phone.

59:23.872 --> 59:25.279
Burn it.

59:44.746 --> 59:45.746
Move.

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:15.090
They're back.

01:01:00.944 --> 01:01:02.777
Don't light any fires.

01:02:01.178 --> 01:02:02.178
- Open it.

01:02:08.495 --> 01:02:10.084
Venison.

01:02:10.085 --> 01:02:12.335
Consider it your last meal.

01:02:15.827 --> 01:02:17.660
Police came to see me.

01:02:19.472 --> 01:02:20.972
I didn't tell 'em.

01:02:22.524 --> 01:02:26.691
You should get that lad home
before he comes to some harm.

01:02:27.187 --> 01:02:30.439
I want you out of this forest by morning.

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.440
Both of you.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:04.527
- I found him.

01:03:09.983 --> 01:03:11.816
- Whose blood is that?

01:03:15.434 --> 01:03:16.684
- What is that?

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:39.697
Where did you get it?

01:03:50.684 --> 01:03:52.101
When was he here?

01:03:53.958 --> 01:03:55.125
- An hour ago.

01:03:59.533 --> 01:04:03.674
We need to go away, go some place new

01:04:05.784 --> 01:04:07.034
and start over.

01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:20.018
- Let's go home.

01:04:25.873 --> 01:04:28.456
- I need to show you something.

01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:46.220
- I don't understand.

01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:03.873
Sam, we need to go home.

01:05:07.962 --> 01:05:10.110
- He moved it when I came to fetch you.

01:05:10.218 --> 01:05:11.423
- Sam, stop.

01:05:11.424 --> 01:05:13.462
- He moved it so now
you wouldn't believe me.

01:05:13.463 --> 01:05:15.095
- Stop!

01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:17.578
There's nothing here.

01:05:20.563 --> 01:05:21.646
Listen to me!

01:05:23.541 --> 01:05:25.157
We have to go home.

01:05:25.158 --> 01:05:26.158
- No!

01:05:26.570 --> 01:05:27.806
You're wrong.

01:05:28.339 --> 01:05:30.066
You're wrong.

01:05:30.441 --> 01:05:32.441
He's here, he's in here!

01:06:37.378 --> 01:06:39.045
- You're still here.

01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:47.464
Come on.

01:06:47.465 --> 01:06:49.422
I'll take you home.

01:06:49.822 --> 01:06:51.489
- Get away from her.

01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:57.583
Lily, come here.

01:06:58.628 --> 01:07:00.045
- It's over, lad.

01:07:02.388 --> 01:07:03.388
- Lily.

01:07:06.587 --> 01:07:08.004
Lily, look at me.

01:07:09.232 --> 01:07:10.987
Ask him about Stewart.

01:07:11.003 --> 01:07:12.366
Ask him about the van.

01:07:12.367 --> 01:07:13.367
- I hid it.

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:16.868
He's been using it to cart away deer.

01:07:16.869 --> 01:07:18.389
Caught him the other night.

01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:19.390
- I saw you.

01:07:20.234 --> 01:07:21.864
I dug it up.

01:07:22.172 --> 01:07:23.444
What have you done with him?

01:07:23.445 --> 01:07:24.730
- With who?

01:07:24.913 --> 01:07:26.202
- Stewart.

01:07:26.203 --> 01:07:28.612
- I fired a few shots
at him, scared him off.

01:07:28.613 --> 01:07:30.363
- What about the bag?

01:07:31.972 --> 01:07:33.111
You moved it.

01:07:33.112 --> 01:07:34.756
- Bag of offal lad.

01:07:34.757 --> 01:07:37.325
He was cutting up a young
doe when I found him.

01:07:37.358 --> 01:07:41.289
What I could butcher I
kept, the rest I buried.

01:07:47.175 --> 01:07:49.175
- He's lying to us Lil.

01:07:54.057 --> 01:07:57.065
He's manipulating you, can't you see that?

01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:03.196
I saw you the other
night out in the forest

01:08:03.229 --> 01:08:04.670
arguing and the gunshots.

01:08:04.671 --> 01:08:05.676
- To scare him off.

01:08:05.677 --> 01:08:06.928
- You're lying.
- I'm no liar.

01:08:06.929 --> 01:08:08.520
- Shut up!
- That's enough.

01:08:08.521 --> 01:08:09.521
Put it down!

01:08:26.821 --> 01:08:28.071
- Come on then.

01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:39.750
Please.

01:08:48.742 --> 01:08:49.787
Shoot me.

01:08:49.788 --> 01:08:50.788
- Sam.

01:09:04.964 --> 01:09:05.964
- Shoot me!

01:09:15.429 --> 01:09:17.345
- I'm going back to the lorry.

01:09:17.912 --> 01:09:22.078
If you're not there in 15
minutes, I'm fetching the police.

01:10:10.215 --> 01:10:13.132
- I won't do this with you anymore.

01:10:19.607 --> 01:10:22.700
I won't do this with you anymore.

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:53.900
- Just you?

01:11:59.571 --> 01:12:00.571
Jump in.

01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:17.220
I'll move this stuff
and we can get you home.

01:13:29.271 --> 01:13:31.438
- Right, all set?

01:15:03.858 --> 01:15:06.608
♫ I've been left

01:15:07.775 --> 01:15:11.858
♫ To lick my wounds for too long

01:15:13.974 --> 01:15:16.891
♫ I'm down to bone

♫ Eek me out, make me last

01:16:17.144 --> 01:16:20.944
♫ I am a broken ship

01:16:20.945 --> 01:16:23.695
♫ A sinking mast

01:16:27.046 --> 01:16:31.213
♫ You fill me up I'm made of holes

01:16:31.279 --> 01:16:32.971
♫ With finger tips

01:16:32.972 --> 01:16:37.139
♫ Red nails and cutting words

01:16:37.617 --> 01:16:40.117
♫ Patch me up

01:16:42.876 --> 01:16:46.459
