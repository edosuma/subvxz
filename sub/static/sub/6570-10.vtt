00:10.040 --> 00:11.041
(KNOCKS)

00:11.920 --> 00:14.127
East Coast polls are closing, ma'am.

00:16.840 --> 00:17.841
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

00:17.920 --> 00:19.331
Ma'am?

00:19.400 --> 00:20.686
History is calling.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.569
And it won't go to voice mail.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.367
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

00:29.440 --> 00:32.125
Hey. You okay, ma'am?

00:32.800 --> 00:34.211
I'd love one, Gary. Thank you.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.809
Okay, I'll get... I'll get you one.

00:38.120 --> 00:41.442
Well, I've asked America
if she wants me to be her president.

00:43.920 --> 00:46.491
Now, she's gonna give us her answer.
(CLEARS THROAT)

00:46.640 --> 00:49.723
America doesn't just love you, ma'am,
she is in love with you.

00:49.800 --> 00:50.801
(BOTH LAUGHING)

00:51.360 --> 00:53.328
MIKE: We've lost Kentucky!

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:06.440 --> 01:10.081
So I assume you reached out
to the O'Brien camp.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.571
Taking a meeting with Charlotte or with Kim?

01:11.640 --> 01:14.564
No, I haven't contacted the O'Brien team.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.883
Amy, if he wins, our lobbying stock
is gonna droop like a chimp's tits.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.121
We're not gonna be the golden kids anymore.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.361
We've got to stay on his radar.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.169
But we need to be in with her, too.

01:22.240 --> 01:23.969
- She might win.
- Yeah.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.849
Well, on-air, I'm gonna keep in with her.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.526
Off-air, I'm telling the Nazis
that she's hiding in the attic.

01:28.600 --> 01:29.726
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.006
- Hi.
- Hey, so...

01:31.080 --> 01:32.889
We have Sally Davenport with us, of course.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.450
We've also got Matty Curtis.

01:34.520 --> 01:35.885
- Wow.
- Love that guy.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.769
The online-statistics savant.

01:37.840 --> 01:41.606
Yeah, in the midterms, he predicted
the margin in every Senate seat.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.364
So, suck it, Fox.

01:43.480 --> 01:44.527
-(ALL LAUGHING)
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:44.920 --> 01:46.126
So we doing this or what?

01:46.200 --> 01:48.362
Hey, well, thank God you're here.

01:48.440 --> 01:49.965
No one else here knows how tonight will go.

01:50.040 --> 01:52.407
- Have fun. Okay.
- Yeah, we'll see you out there.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.960
- So, closest election in living memory.
- Yeah.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.280
- Yeah.
- Hope you guys are prepared.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.601
- We will do our best.
- Well, we're gonna need better than that.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.290
- Okay.
-l'm kidding. I'm just kidding.

02:00.360 --> 02:01.964
But you better be good.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.689
MAN: Sorry, guys,
we need this area to be clear.

02:05.760 --> 02:07.683
Hey, wait, it's the testicle man.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.411
Guilty as charged.
Check 'em, don't neglect 'em.

02:10.479 --> 02:12.687
This whole scrotum situation
is really working out for you, sir.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.764
That hearing was terrible,
but it really got my face out there, you know?

02:15.840 --> 02:18.844
You're the face of workplace bullying
and genital health.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.127
Look at this. Mike wants me up
in the presidential suite

02:23.200 --> 02:25.441
to get a one-on-one thank you
from the President.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.091
- How do I look? Thanks.
- Great.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.446
No, no, no. One-on-one.

02:29.520 --> 02:30.646
Oh, yeah, okay.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.881
Oh, man, election nights are my cocaine.

02:33.960 --> 02:36.327
It used to be election nights and cocaine
were my cocaine, but...

02:36.400 --> 02:38.243
If Fox says it's close, then it must be.

02:38.320 --> 02:41.005
- Then again, they said the Rapture was close.
- Anything yet?

02:41.080 --> 02:43.686
Indiana and South Carolina
just called for O'Brien.

02:43.760 --> 02:47.401
Yeah, Vermont and Connecticut,
yup, they're for us.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.602
Yeah, Vermont! Yeah, Connecticut!

02:49.680 --> 02:52.809
Okay, settle down.
A bowl of hair could win those states.

02:52.880 --> 02:55.531
- Ma'am, you have a moment for Jonah?
- Jonah. Yeah.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.841
I want to thank you for your work
on men's health

02:57.920 --> 03:00.969
and talking about that bullying
that you had to endure.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.451
- Thank you, ma'am. It was my honor...
- You know what?

03:02.520 --> 03:03.521
I need to thank Vermont.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.170
Yeah, that's it, Jonah. It's been a busy night.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.526
What was that? I got, like, four seconds.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.125
Well, most people get just two.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.043
- Projections for Wisconsin, ma'am.
- Great.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.487
I haven't read them yet.
I'm saving that for when I go to prison.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.085
Even money, they give you the chair.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.003
No one came out of the hearings
unscathed, Bill.

03:16.080 --> 03:17.605
I had to ditch my fiancé.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.409
I'll be thinking about that
while I'm with whichever guy

03:19.480 --> 03:21.448
-makes me his prison fiancé.
- Ew.

03:21.520 --> 03:24.808
Oh, Gary, I asked a friend to come
and be with me tonight.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.245
- How nice.
- Yeah, Karen.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.685
- Fuck!
- What?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.445
Cramp. (CLEARS THROAT)

03:29.560 --> 03:32.689
Senator O'Brien has 33 electoral votes
based on our projection.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.205
President Meyer has 10.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.566
Is this significant, Dan?

03:35.640 --> 03:38.325
I think it's far, far too early to tell at this point.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.562
- I mean, the election really is...
- Very significant.

03:40.640 --> 03:43.371
Uncertainty in battleground states
is bleeding into other areas.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.727
It's the suburbs that
are gonna decide this contest.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.041
Well, Amy, Dan, who do you feel
will win tonight?

03:48.120 --> 03:49.406
- It's so close.
- So close.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.403
- It's a tough call to make at this point.
- Mmm-hmm.

03:51.480 --> 03:54.165
And not just for us, Greg, but for America.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.242
That was transcendent bullshitting.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.688
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
If I do lose, I'm gonna lose like a winner.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.450
- You're not gonna lose, okay?
- Right. Right.

04:01.520 --> 04:04.091
You're gonna win in a slide.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.924
You know, marginally.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.650
Oh, my God, look who's here!

04:09.720 --> 04:12.769
- Hi, it's Karen.
-lt's Karen.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.888
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.644
Everybody, Karen.

04:16.720 --> 04:19.610
Hi, Tom. Karen.
Yeah, we met at the convention.

04:19.680 --> 04:20.920
Okay.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.401
Tell me how you're doing.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.289
Well, I'm trying to stay positive.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.044
We lost Oklahoma.

04:26.160 --> 04:28.003
Which we were expected to, so...

04:28.120 --> 04:29.963
It's only seven votes.

04:30.480 --> 04:33.723
These damn hotel carpets.
I keep getting that static-electric shock.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.280
You need one of those ionic
bracelets that grounds you.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.407
Good call.

04:37.480 --> 04:40.962
It's the prison toilet situation
which preys on one's mind.

04:41.040 --> 04:44.761
Defecating in full view
of another man is unthinkable.

04:44.840 --> 04:47.969
Forgive me, Bill, but I don't wish
to ever discuss this.

04:48.040 --> 04:49.644
Yeah, Bill, put a cork in it, will you?

04:49.720 --> 04:51.370
You know, that actually may help.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.330
Hey, listen, how much did you
pay your lawyers?

04:54.400 --> 04:58.724
Because I lawyered up for the hearings
and they charged me 15 grand,

04:58.800 --> 05:00.802
and they only said words, you know?

05:00.880 --> 05:02.723
Shh! There's a call coming.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.690
He's like a Native American tracker.
He can hear it in the wind.

05:05.760 --> 05:08.969
<i>Senator O'Brien is the predicted victor
in the great state of Minnesota</i>

05:09.040 --> 05:10.929
<i>-with 10 electoral votes.</i>
- Oh, <i>fuck!</i>

05:11.000 --> 05:13.526
- I thought that was ours.
- I thought we had it.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.806
I wasn't entirely sure.

05:14.880 --> 05:15.961
Ma'am.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.122
- Shit.
- If you'll excuse me for one second?

05:18.200 --> 05:21.443
I'm not saying we will, because we won't,
but if we do lose,

05:21.520 --> 05:23.284
and you're an outgoing president,
you could...

05:23.360 --> 05:24.725
- I could pardon you?
- Yes.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.849
That wouldn't look good.
You'd be the first person to say that.

05:27.920 --> 05:31.811
I'm not entirely sure
I would in this circumstance.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.245
- If... If there's any way...
- Hey, Bill,

05:33.360 --> 05:36.603
I got a lot on the line
with my presidency right now,

05:36.680 --> 05:39.923
so I don't really have time to be thinking
about your whatever the fuck it is.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.650
- Probable imprisonment.
- Exactly.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.131
- Thank you, ma'am.
- You're welcome.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.890
WOMAN: What will you do if O'Brien wins?

05:45.960 --> 05:48.201
Set up an office with Selina
at the Betty Ford Clinic?

05:48.280 --> 05:51.523
No, I've applied for a job outside.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.125
Politics bores me.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.851
It bores the living hell out of me.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.046
God, it's boring.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.449
Amy looks off her game, distracted.

06:01.520 --> 06:04.444
I only really know Amy
as the woman who rushed everywhere,

06:04.520 --> 06:07.091
clutching her phone
like it contained her frozen embryos.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.730
She's a workaholic.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.529
Works frantically to avoid dealing with

06:10.640 --> 06:13.883
her weird mix of lack of self-worth
and narcissism.

06:13.960 --> 06:15.450
I really like her.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.244
Uh, Ma'am, I don't mean to be
the bearer of bad news, but...

06:19.320 --> 06:23.006
Called Wisconsin.
Projected as an O'Brien win.

06:23.080 --> 06:25.890
That was the bad news,
which, in the end, I didn't bear.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.361
<i>Well, this is certainly something
not many people saw coming.</i>

06:28.440 --> 06:31.603
For me, it's the domino that signals
an O'Brien victory tonight.

06:31.680 --> 06:35.401
This is a big, big win for O'Brien,

06:35.480 --> 06:38.086
and I think the Meyer team
is gonna be feeling that.

06:38.520 --> 06:39.646
The... The bigness.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.207
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

06:41.280 --> 06:44.682
<i>Amy, is the race already slipping away
from your former boss?</i>

06:44.800 --> 06:46.211
<i>No. No.</i>

06:46.600 --> 06:47.601
Um...

06:48.360 --> 06:50.442
A lot of the polls have not closed yet.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.202
So, no. No, you know, it's no.

06:54.280 --> 06:58.126
I think O'Brien's gonna win this election.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.850
O'Brien can't be president.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.321
He's still contracted to be the KFC logo.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.201
You're gonna win this, ma'am.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.327
- I don't know.
- Oh, you are.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.845
You think you would have won?

07:06.920 --> 07:08.524
What do you mean?

07:08.600 --> 07:11.490
If you had been the candidate,
you think you would have won?

07:11.560 --> 07:13.289
'Cause that's the speculation, you know.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.771
What do you think, Karen?

07:14.840 --> 07:17.571
About something specific, or...

07:17.640 --> 07:20.564
Should the President
and I have swapped roles?

07:20.640 --> 07:21.846
For?

07:21.960 --> 07:25.601
For the election. This election.
There's an election going on.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.444
Oh, Well... (SCOFFS)

07:27.520 --> 07:29.522
Well, you're asking me
a hypothetical question,

07:29.600 --> 07:32.046
and I need to answer it as best I can.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.646
Okay, well, you just did.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.882
Great. (LAUGHS)

07:37.880 --> 07:40.087
Amy, I saw your instability on TV.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.685
Call me when you get this.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.888
Get someone else to dial
if you're in a straightjacket.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.204
Hey, I'm sending some of our data to O'Brien.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.129
If he wins this thing, I need to kiss his ass.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.850
Mmm-hmm. I'm going. I have to go.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.490
What? No, you can't do that.

07:52.560 --> 07:53.971
Yeah, no, I have to see this
play out with Selina.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.611
I've spent a third of my life
leading up to this night, so...

07:56.680 --> 07:57.886
Amy...

07:59.880 --> 08:00.927
Greg.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.487
I have to go.

08:02.560 --> 08:03.800
- You have to go?
- Yeah.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.331
What does that mean?
This is not summer camp.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.721
Well, I just feel that I'm needed elsewhere.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.129
Oh, well, then, please go.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.170
Some of our viewers were complaining
that you're shrill anyway, so...

08:14.240 --> 08:17.084
Shrill? No, no, no, I'm never shrill.
And that's...

08:17.160 --> 08:19.731
(STAMMERS) And you're acting as though
I'm sounding shrill right now?

08:19.800 --> 08:22.485
Yeah, yeah, keep making that face
implying that I'm shrill.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.723
Hey, could someone check the parking lot?
I think all the alarms are going off.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.404
Sorry for your loss, ma'am.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.847
- I mean, about Wisconsin, not a person...
- I know... Ow!

08:29.920 --> 08:30.921
Fuck!

08:31.000 --> 08:33.366
I forgot. I have incompatible shoes
with the rug.

08:33.440 --> 08:34.804
- God.
-l'm so sorry.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.201
<i>We don't have a lot of good news
for President Meyer.</i>

08:37.280 --> 08:41.205
Screw this whole sloppy,
backseat blowjob of a night anyway.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.280
I don't give a shit.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.124
- Hang on.
- Hang on what?

08:44.200 --> 08:45.850
The Wisconsin call has been rescinded.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.530
You mean they went back on the call?

08:47.600 --> 08:49.568
Yes, hence my saying that they had.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.686
"Rescinded" is actually not a word
that's immediately clear.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.770

19:02.240 --> 19:05.801
What? Well, let's see. First of all, no.

19:05.880 --> 19:09.885
And then the other thing
I really wanted to say was no.

19:10.840 --> 19:11.807
I'm hearing a no.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.649
Jonah, sorry, the answer is...

19:14.360 --> 19:16.328
Oh, hello.

19:16.400 --> 19:20.166
- What? What is it?
- Holy mother of moly.

19:20.240 --> 19:23.210
Ma'am, Fox is calling
Washington State for us.

19:23.280 --> 19:24.691
-Yes!
-(GASPS) No!

19:24.760 --> 19:27.240
- They called Ohio.
- Oh, my God, that's amazing!

19:27.320 --> 19:29.402
- BEN: Ohio?
- No, for O'Brien. I should have said.

19:29.520 --> 19:32.763
- Oh, my God.
- ABC is saying it's still too close to call.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.683
- Yeah.
- No, they're calling it now.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.569
- O'Brien.
- Shit!

19:36.640 --> 19:37.926
Fox again and POLITICO.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.923
New Hampshire to O'Brien and Ohio.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.240
Yes, we took Florida!

19:41.320 --> 19:43.004
SELINA: We did not!
BEN: Twenty-nine.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.969
- That is extraordinary.
- Yes.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.849
- What is my number now, Kent?
- Okay, one second.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.604
- You're two... You're...
- What?

19:48.720 --> 19:50.165
Yeah, you're 256.

19:50.240 --> 19:53.050
- Kent, where does that leave us?
- Okay, it all comes down to Virginia.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.361
If O'Brien gets Virginia, he wins.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.603
- However, if we get Virginia...
- We win!

19:58.680 --> 20:00.808
No, actually, Gary, if we get it, we tie.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.120
What?

20:02.200 --> 20:05.488
What? I don't follow these things that closely,
but that's right, isn't it, Mr. Davison?

20:05.600 --> 20:06.886
Yes.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.642
- Tie, like it's a tie? You mean, we tie?
- Mmm-hmm.

20:09.720 --> 20:10.721
You do.

20:10.800 --> 20:11.801
The real shock, Greg,

20:12.120 --> 20:13.087
ls where this leaves us.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.208
Neck and neck if the President takes Virginia.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.408
Matty, you'll forgive me if I sideline you here.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.481
- Dan...
- Sure.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.721
...you know the President well.

20:19.800 --> 20:23.725
What is going on in that Meyer hotel suite
right this second?

20:23.800 --> 20:26.007
The President has a lot of top minds
working on her campaign.

20:26.120 --> 20:27.201
They're gonna be all over this.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.931
What happens when there's a tie?

20:30.040 --> 20:33.089
Everybody goes online to try to find out
what happens if we get a tie.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.446
Way ahead of you.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.249
Shit, I'm just getting how to tie a tie.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.449
Is there a book? Like an old-fashioned...
Like a paper book?

20:39.520 --> 20:41.488
Jesus Christ, you know?

20:41.560 --> 20:43.927
You do your best.
You try to serve the people,

20:44.000 --> 20:45.729
-and then they just fuck you over.
- Yeah.

20:45.800 --> 20:50.203
And you know why? Because they're ignorant
and they're dumb as shit.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.521
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is democracy.

20:52.600 --> 20:53.840
God damn it.

20:53.920 --> 20:54.921
It's the Twelfth Amendment.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.924
- I have Twentieth Amendment. Yeah.
- Why are there so many amendments?

20:58.000 --> 20:59.365
Get it right the first time, people.

20:59.440 --> 21:02.569
It's actually both.
Twelfth is superseded by the Twentieth.

21:02.640 --> 21:06.440
They give the House until January 20th
to elect the president.

21:06.520 --> 21:10.491
Each state gets one vote.
First candidate to 26 is the new president

21:10.560 --> 21:11.641
and the Senate chooses the VP.

21:11.720 --> 21:15.406
It's a close election
with a ton of House races too close to call.

21:15.480 --> 21:17.482
- What happens if it's a tie in the House?
- Right.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.766
Is it a dance-off?

21:18.880 --> 21:20.848
Well, vice president-elect becomes president.

21:20.920 --> 21:23.127
Whoever the Senate has picked for VP
will be president.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.043
- Wait, that means...
- That Tom...

21:25.120 --> 21:27.521
- What?
-...could be the president.

21:29.720 --> 21:33.042
Well, l... I had literally no idea.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.044
I mean, it's good to be prepared.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.484
So... Wait. So you mean that I...

21:42.560 --> 21:46.042
I might lose this election
to my fucking vice president?

21:47.040 --> 21:49.168
At least it'd be somebody
from our team, ma'am.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.288
I mean, that's good, right?

21:52.720 --> 21:53.926
(SOBS)

21:54.040 --> 21:55.963
I didn't mean to make her cry.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.251
There, there.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.010
It's gonna be okay.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.688
- She's going down.
- She's going down.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.091
Don't touch her.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.730
(SOBBING CONTINUES)

22:15.360 --> 22:16.361
Yeah?

22:16.480 --> 22:19.962
Sir, I'm sorry to contact you directly,
but the crowd is drooling for you.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.610
Yup, floor is wet out here.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.011
Okay, great. Thank you.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.411
ALL: (CHANTING) Tom James!
Tom James! Tom James...

22:24.480 --> 22:26.482
I'm gonna go rally the rally.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.162
With all due respect,

22:29.240 --> 22:31.846
you need to get your shit together now, lady.

22:31.920 --> 22:35.129
Ma'am up. You're still the leader
of the free world.

22:35.440 --> 22:36.441
Hmm?

22:39.280 --> 22:40.281
Where's Tom?

22:40.440 --> 22:41.441
Oh, uh...

22:41.520 --> 22:43.887
He's gone to talk to the crowd at the rally.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.281
- What?
- The fuck he has.

22:46.360 --> 22:47.566
Why would you let him do that?

22:47.640 --> 22:49.085
Well, you don't work here.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.446
Well, neither do you.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.522
All right, fuck all of you. I'm going to the rally.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.722
Ma'am, ma'am, that would be unprecedented.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.280
No, I'll tell you what's unprecedented, Kent.

22:57.360 --> 22:59.806
A tie is unprecedented.

22:59.880 --> 23:02.201
So is becoming the first lady president.

23:02.280 --> 23:06.569
So is that jackoff becoming president
through the back door.

23:06.640 --> 23:12.363
Okay? The rule book's been torn up now
and America is wiping its nasty ass with it!

23:13.960 --> 23:15.121
Get the fuck out of my way!

23:15.440 --> 23:17.090
BEN: Ma'am! Ma'am!

23:17.160 --> 23:18.207
Let's go.

23:21.160 --> 23:24.084
ALL: (CHANTING) Tom James!
Tom James! Tom James!

23:24.280 --> 23:26.123
(ALL CHEERING)

23:31.000 --> 23:32.126
<i>Thank you.</i>

23:32.200 --> 23:34.407
Okay, I admit, this isn't boring.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.801
Why make the total of electoral votes
an even number?

23:36.880 --> 23:37.927
Insanity?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.526
<i>Listen, I know this is a long night.</i>

23:40.600 --> 23:43.206
<i>You're tired and you're cold
and your legs ache</i>

23:43.280 --> 23:44.691
<i>and you need the bathroom.</i>

23:44.760 --> 23:46.842
<i>Boy, do you need the bathroom.</i>

23:48.080 --> 23:49.889
That fucking guy.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.809
With his fucking charm and his fucking son

23:53.880 --> 23:56.850
and his fucking wheelchair
with his spine all fucked up.

23:56.920 --> 24:00.402
<i>My grandmother survived the Dust Bowl.</i>

24:00.480 --> 24:03.723
<i>And before she died at the age of 89,</i>

24:03.800 --> 24:08.647
<i>she told me</i> a <i>secret
that she kept for almost 50 years.</i>

24:08.720 --> 24:09.926
<i>The story concerns...</i>

24:10.000 --> 24:13.846
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Tom James.
How about it?</i>

24:14.240 --> 24:15.651
(ALL CHEERING LOUDLY)

24:16.520 --> 24:17.851
<i>Thank you.</i>

24:18.480 --> 24:19.606
<i>Thank you.</i>

24:20.200 --> 24:22.407
<i>Thank you. Wow.</i>

24:22.520 --> 24:25.126
<i>Do I know how to pick 'em? Yup.</i>

24:25.200 --> 24:30.001
<i>Well, thank you so much for being here.
I know it's been a wait.</i>

24:30.080 --> 24:33.801
<i>And we really do appreciate your presence.</i>

24:33.880 --> 24:38.568
<i>What a night, right? It's the night of nights.</i>

24:41.120 --> 24:42.167
Um...

24:42.240 --> 24:43.765
<i>You know what I wanna do?</i>

24:43.840 --> 24:48.880
<i>I want to introduce you
to the First Daughter of the United States,</i>

24:48.960 --> 24:53.329
<i>my daughter, Catherine Selina Meyer.</i>

24:53.400 --> 24:54.765
<i>Catherine.</i>

24:56.920 --> 24:58.001
<i>Always a delight to have...</i>

24:58.080 --> 25:01.687
<i>She is such a beautiful girl.
I'm so proud of her.</i>

25:01.760 --> 25:04.525
<i>Well, we have another minute or so
before we're prepared to call Virginia.</i>

25:04.600 --> 25:06.682
<i>Just checking a couple of precincts.</i>

25:06.760 --> 25:09.161
<i>We've made some
premature calls this evening.</i>

25:09.240 --> 25:12.528
<i>So we're anxious
to be absolutely certain this time.</i>

25:12.600 --> 25:17.731
<i>Why don't we meet
some of the people who lift me up?</i>

25:17.800 --> 25:19.529
<i>I'd like you to meet them.</i>

25:19.600 --> 25:22.729
<i>Guys, come on out.
How about these great faces?</i>

25:22.800 --> 25:26.486
<i>Incredible scenes. Never happened before.
Very emotional moment.</i>

25:26.560 --> 25:27.891
Dan, do you wish you were there?

25:27.960 --> 25:30.042
I'm sure it's a very exciting place to be at.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.691
- There's never been an election like this.
- No.

25:32.800 --> 25:33.881
You must want to be there.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.251
<i>Folks, you don't know her,
but this is Karen Collins.</i>

25:38.320 --> 25:41.210
<i>And she has been a friend of mine for a while.</i>

25:42.080 --> 25:45.607
<i>Yup. And Amy Brookheimer is here.</i>

25:45.680 --> 25:50.288
<i>Amy Brookheimer who
so successfully ran my campaign</i>

25:50.400 --> 25:52.004
<i>until she became unwell.</i>

25:53.120 --> 25:56.522
<i>I'll tell you somebody else
that is not here tonight</i>

25:56.600 --> 25:58.090
<i>who was with the campaign...</i>

25:58.200 --> 25:59.565
Sounds like it could be you, Dan.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.642
Well, I would be incredibly touched.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.484
<i>...and that is, of course, Leslie Kerr.</i>

26:04.920 --> 26:06.649
<i>I'm sure Leslie is thanking you, too.</i>

26:06.720 --> 26:09.803
<i>And I'm hearing we can now
project a Virginia result.</i>

26:09.920 --> 26:12.287
<i>- Dan, what is that projection?
- Thank you, Greg.</i>

26:12.360 --> 26:15.091
<i>CNN is prepared to make
the following projection,</i>

26:15.160 --> 26:18.687
<i>that Virginia, with its 13 electoral votes,</i>

26:18.760 --> 26:21.604
<i>is a win for President Meyer.</i>

26:22.720 --> 26:24.006
<i>This election is a tie.</i>

26:28.320 --> 26:29.970
<i>We did it!</i>

26:31.640 --> 26:35.884
<i>We have one more hurdle to overcome.</i>

26:35.960 --> 26:37.849
<i>And we shall overcome.</i>

26:38.440 --> 26:40.841
<i>One more river to cross.</i>

26:41.360 --> 26:43.806
<i>One more mountain to climb.</i>

26:44.800 --> 26:48.009
<i>But I have been to the mountaintop.</i>

26:49.560 --> 26:51.289
<i>Thank you.</i>

26:59.040 --> 27:01.281
- I don't know what to do.
- We don't do anything.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.966
- You do what you have to do.
- Yeah, I'm getting drunk.

27:04.040 --> 27:08.887
Hey, Dan, when you get this,
can you put in a good word for me with Greg?

27:08.960 --> 27:11.611
I think that I need to keep my TV work going.

27:11.680 --> 27:14.684
Okay, you're gonna win.
And if you don't, I'll kill myself.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.967
Kent, what happens next?
You've got to know.

27:17.040 --> 27:20.249
No, I'm afraid not. Some of these House races,
they're still too close to call.

27:20.320 --> 27:21.401
What does that mean?

27:21.480 --> 27:25.326
Well, presently, we cannot predict the result
of the vote in Congress on January 20.

27:25.400 --> 27:28.006
- We're in a kind of purgatory.
- Welcome to my world.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.366
- Can you stop thinking about yourself...
- Honestly.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.521
...for one second?

27:30.600 --> 27:34.082
No, because I'm going to prison.
Have I mentioned that?

27:34.160 --> 27:35.924
- So what are we gonna do here?
- Should we drop the balloons?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.321
- No, no balloons.
- Maybe just drop half of them?

27:38.400 --> 27:40.482
- No!
- Why do we even have balloons?

27:40.560 --> 27:45.521
Ma'am, I seriously overstepped the mark
going out onstage.

27:45.640 --> 27:46.801
That was a fuck-up.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.564
Yeah, I'll say.

27:48.640 --> 27:50.881
You might wanna watch that
if you become president.

27:51.320 --> 27:54.449
If that does happen, wanna be my Veep?

27:55.000 --> 27:56.331
(SCOFFS)

27:58.160 --> 27:59.730
Why don't you go help them
with the balloons?

28:01.640 --> 28:02.766
Copy that.
