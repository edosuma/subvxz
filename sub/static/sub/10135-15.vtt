07:57.352 --> 07:59.479
No more junk food.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.493
Hey, I saw you on TV

08:10.824 --> 08:13.493
this morning.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.954
Really? Thank you.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.832
You're, uh, Rebecca's husband?

08:15.996 --> 08:18.832
Jesse Donaldson?

08:18.873 --> 08:21.335
It's Katsopolis.

08:18.873 --> 08:21.335
Jesse Katsopolis.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.752
Whatever. I'm George.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.545
And it's nice to meet

08:22.794 --> 08:24.545
another house husband.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.965
I'm not a house husband.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.965
I'm a, I'm a musician.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.468
Yeah, I'm a screenwriter.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.261
Look, I-I'm just doing this

08:29.509 --> 08:31.261
because my career

08:31.303 --> 08:33.347
is temporarily on hold, okay?

08:33.388 --> 08:34.889
Yeah, you know, I said the same

08:33.388 --> 08:34.889
thing to my wife when she went

08:34.931 --> 08:37.642
back to work.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.642
That was four years ago.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.560
So, so for four years,

08:37.684 --> 08:39.560
all you've done is

08:39.602 --> 08:41.188
take care of the kids

08:39.602 --> 08:41.188
and the house?

08:41.229 --> 08:43.857
Uh, of course, not,

08:41.229 --> 08:43.857
I mean, there's, uh, shopping

08:43.898 --> 08:45.817
and car pools,

08:43.898 --> 08:45.817
and oh, my favorite soap

08:45.859 --> 08:48.362
"General Hospital."

08:48.403 --> 08:49.863
Listen, I-I gotta run.

08:48.403 --> 08:49.863
I'll see you Thursday.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.406
Double coupon day.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.826
Hope I could sleep

08:52.615 --> 08:54.826
Wednesday night.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.705
Hmm. These Funky Franks

08:56.661 --> 08:58.705
are pretty good.

08:58.746 --> 09:01.041
I better try a few more

08:58.746 --> 09:01.041
just to make sure.

09:06.463 --> 09:09.716
Uh-oh!

09:09.757 --> 09:13.011
Ah! What have I done?

09:09.757 --> 09:13.011
I got mustard on D.J.'s sweater.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.639
She's goin' to have a cow.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.226
Tell me something I don't know.

09:19.267 --> 09:22.437
Yesterday, I dropped

09:19.267 --> 09:22.437
your toothbrush in the toilet.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.941
Alright, come on, girls.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.941
Let's go.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.069
All we need are paper towels.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.531
I'll get one.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.241
Wait, there.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.241
Ho-ho-hold it, Michelle.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.535
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.286
I'm just trying to help.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.497
Well, thank you, but you never

09:38.328 --> 09:40.497
take from the bottom.

09:40.539 --> 09:43.750
Always take from the top.

09:40.539 --> 09:43.750
Like this, you see?

09:47.504 --> 09:49.381
I could have done that.

09:57.514 --> 10:01.184
- I set the table, Uncle Jesse.

09:57.514 --> 10:01.184
- Thank you.

10:02.643 --> 10:06.147
I'm too full to eat dinner,

10:02.643 --> 10:06.147
Uncle Jesse.

10:06.189 --> 10:09.192
Now I know why

10:06.189 --> 10:09.192
they call them Funky Franks.

10:09.234 --> 10:12.195
Alright. Michelle,

10:09.234 --> 10:12.195
take one plate away.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.989
Now you see it,

10:12.237 --> 10:14.989
now you don't.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.074
[beeping]

10:16.116 --> 10:17.576
That's my laundry.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.328
I'm gonna go check on the boys.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.328
I'll be right back.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.038
(Stephanie)

10:20.370 --> 10:22.038
I threw D.J.'s sweater in.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.541
I hope that mustard stain

10:22.080 --> 10:24.541
came out.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.002
[screams]

10:29.879 --> 10:31.714
It shrank.

10:34.926 --> 10:37.137
That will fit my Barbie.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.181
(together)

10:39.013 --> 10:40.181
Hi.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.933
Deej, my loving sister.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.851
How nice to see you.

10:43.893 --> 10:46.104
I'm just going to go

10:43.893 --> 10:46.104
in the living room

10:46.146 --> 10:49.190
and, uh, oh, uh,

10:46.146 --> 10:49.190
practice my moonwalk.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.402
Steph, the 80s are over.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.822
Oh, girls.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.822
Just in time for dinner.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.907
Oh, sorry, Uncle Jesse

10:55.863 --> 10:57.907
but Kimmy and I

10:57.949 --> 10:59.493
are gonna go study

10:57.949 --> 10:59.493
at the library.

10:59.534 --> 11:00.994
We'll catch a burger

10:59.534 --> 11:00.994
on the way.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.079
Is that the thanks

11:01.035 --> 11:03.079
I get after slaving

11:03.121 --> 11:05.123
over a hot stove all day?

11:05.165 --> 11:07.875
Boy, you sound just like my mom.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.710
Only more bitter.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.260
There goes another plate.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.140
Hey, Jess.

11:27.770 --> 11:31.774
- Did you, uh, lose something?

11:27.770 --> 11:31.774
- Yeah, the use of my neck.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.362
I tried to crack it myself.

11:35.403 --> 11:38.323
You know, it's amazing

11:35.403 --> 11:38.323
how many people need shoeshines.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.117
Where's Becky and Danny?

11:41.159 --> 11:43.077
Oh, they said to tell you

11:41.159 --> 11:43.077
they had to work late

11:43.119 --> 11:45.038
and they'll be late for dinner.

11:45.079 --> 11:50.210
- Michelle, two more plates.

11:45.079 --> 11:50.210
- Why do I even bother?

11:52.837 --> 11:55.298
Well, I gotta go

11:52.837 --> 11:55.298
see a chiropractor

11:55.340 --> 11:58.385
so I'm not gonna be here

11:55.340 --> 11:58.385
for dinner either.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.971
- Michelle.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.971
- What is this? A joke?

12:04.098 --> 12:05.684
Hey, Jess,

12:04.098 --> 12:05.684
can you do me a favor

12:05.724 --> 12:07.394
and sew this button

12:05.724 --> 12:07.394
onto Mr. Woodchuck?

12:07.435 --> 12:09.437
Oh, I'd love to.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.106
Boy, this floor

12:09.479 --> 12:12.106
needs a wax job.

12:13.774 --> 12:16.819
Not only am I Mr. Mom,

12:13.774 --> 12:16.819
I'm Mr. Woodchuck's mom.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.073
[sighs]

12:21.241 --> 12:23.076
What a day.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.039
Are you totally bummed?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.832
Yeah, totally.

12:29.874 --> 12:33.211
Go ahead.

12:29.874 --> 12:33.211
Tell me all about it.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.795
I just..

12:33.253 --> 12:34.795
I'm just afraid.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.297
You know, I mean, what if

12:34.837 --> 12:36.297
I never get a record deal?

12:36.339 --> 12:38.925
I mean, is this it for me?

12:36.339 --> 12:38.925
Cooking, cleaning.

12:38.966 --> 12:41.386
Watching the kids

12:38.966 --> 12:41.386
while Becky's at work?

12:41.428 --> 12:43.430
I gotta make some changes

12:41.428 --> 12:43.430
in my life.

12:43.471 --> 12:46.391
Can we eat dinner first?

12:46.433 --> 12:48.476
Sure, kid,

12:46.433 --> 12:48.476
hope you're hungry

12:48.518 --> 12:50.895
because, uh, it's just

12:48.518 --> 12:50.895
you and me eatin'.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.607
I think you forgot somebody.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.447
<i>Bon appetit,</i> Comet.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.247
Alright. There.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.125
Your button's on,

13:09.289 --> 13:12.125
you sawdust-sucking tree freak.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.212
Oh, you have

13:14.294 --> 13:16.212
no snappy comebacks

13:16.254 --> 13:18.965
since Joey's hand's

13:16.254 --> 13:18.965
not up your back, huh?

13:19.966 --> 13:21.926
That's what I thought.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.221
- Hi, honey.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.221
- 'Hi.'

13:25.263 --> 13:27.474
- I'm sorry I missed dinner.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.474
- That's okay.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.892
- Hello, boys.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.892
- I tell you, Jess.

13:29.934 --> 13:33.020
I-I know I should be happy

13:29.934 --> 13:33.020
about Vicky's new job in Chicago

13:33.062 --> 13:35.315
and I am, but I'm-I'm feeling

13:33.062 --> 13:35.315
a little guilty

13:35.356 --> 13:37.358
that I'm not happy enough,

13:35.356 --> 13:37.358
you know?

13:37.400 --> 13:39.569
I think I hid my feelings

13:37.400 --> 13:39.569
pretty well although I did weep

13:39.611 --> 13:41.820
all over her

13:39.611 --> 13:41.820
goodbye ice cream cake.

13:41.862 --> 13:45.032
I'm fine about this.

13:41.862 --> 13:45.032
I-I really am. Just..

13:45.074 --> 13:46.909
Do you guys know

13:45.074 --> 13:46.909
a good therapist?

13:46.951 --> 13:49.162
I'll be leaving now.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.581
- He's taking it well.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.581
- Yes, he is.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.207
So, honey, how was your day?

13:53.249 --> 13:56.835
Well, the record company called.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.835
They didn't like my demo.

13:56.877 --> 14:00.465
- Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

13:56.877 --> 14:00.465
- Nah, it's alright.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.050
I'm shaking things up.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.050
I got myself a gig tonight.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.219
I'm playing with an oldies band

14:03.092 --> 14:05.219
at the airport lounge.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.807
- The airport lounge?

14:06.304 --> 14:08.807
- Mm-hmm.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.685
- Honey, isn't that a step down?

14:08.847 --> 14:11.685
- From unemployment?

14:11.726 --> 14:13.770
Nah, it's music.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.770
It's a paycheck.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.396
Besides, I get a real

14:13.812 --> 14:15.396
nice coloring book

14:15.438 --> 14:17.064
and those little wings.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.193
Honey, I've been gone all day.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.779
I mean, this was supposed

14:20.234 --> 14:22.779
to be our time together.

14:22.821 --> 14:25.448
Well, this is my time to make

14:22.821 --> 14:25.448
some money for my family.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.367
Oh, Jesse, I make more

14:25.490 --> 14:27.367
than enough money

14:27.408 --> 14:29.703
to support our family.

14:29.744 --> 14:32.246
Thanks for reminding me.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.833
What? You have some problem

14:32.288 --> 14:34.833
with me making a decent living?

14:34.874 --> 14:37.210
No, I have a problem with me

14:34.874 --> 14:37.210
making a decent living.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.045
Oh, okay. So now I know

14:37.251 --> 14:39.045
what argument I'm in.

14:39.086 --> 14:41.047
This is about

14:39.086 --> 14:41.047
your stubborn macho pride.

14:41.088 --> 14:44.342
What pride? I don't have

14:41.088 --> 14:44.342
any pride. I lost my pride.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.469
I'm gonna get some pride.

14:48.847 --> 14:51.015
Say goodbye to Mr. Donaldson.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.569
Hey, Steph, have you seen

15:00.066 --> 15:02.569
the heating pad?

15:02.610 --> 15:04.070
In dad's top drawer.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.988
You know, he preheats

15:04.111 --> 15:05.988
his socks in the winter.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.784
- How's your neck, Joey?

15:07.907 --> 15:09.784
- Oh, it's much better.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.245
I just can't make

15:09.826 --> 15:12.245
any sudden moves.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.789
Look what fits me!

15:15.956 --> 15:19.043
- Michelle!

15:15.956 --> 15:19.043
- What? Aah!

15:19.085 --> 15:22.881
[grunting]

15:19.085 --> 15:22.881
Oh, I just threw

15:19.085 --> 15:22.881
my neck out again.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.592
[as Mr. Woodchuck]

15:22.922 --> 15:25.592
Way to go, stupid.

15:27.802 --> 15:30.764
Hey, I have the exact

15:27.802 --> 15:30.764
same sweater in my closet.

15:30.805 --> 15:33.974
Well, it's a small world

15:30.805 --> 15:33.974
after all.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.852
And that one has

15:34.016 --> 15:35.852
a button missing right where

15:35.894 --> 15:38.396
this one has a button missing.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.189
Can someone explain this?

15:40.231 --> 15:43.735
I just wear 'em.

15:40.231 --> 15:43.735
I don't shrink 'em.

15:45.152 --> 15:48.865
- Steph?

15:45.152 --> 15:48.865
- Alright, this is your sweater.

15:48.907 --> 15:52.034
I stole it, I stained it,

15:48.907 --> 15:52.034
I shrunk it.

15:53.244 --> 15:55.037
I should have buried it.

15:56.038 --> 15:59.417
Okay, D.J., have that cow.

16:01.836 --> 16:05.548
I'm so sorry, D.J. I'll do

16:01.836 --> 16:05.548
anything to make it up to you.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.007
Well, make it up to Kimmy.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.636
I borrowed that sweater

16:07.049 --> 16:09.636
from her last summer.
