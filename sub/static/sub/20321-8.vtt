00:15.840 --> 00:17.291
Superintendent.

00:17.411 --> 00:20.701
May I say how surprised I am
to see you in the field?

00:20.768 --> 00:23.370
Especially for a body
found in a stairwell.

00:23.438 --> 00:27.006
It's not just any body, Alvin.
It's a case in point

00:27.074 --> 00:29.008
of the kind of cancer that's
eating at this neighbourhood.

00:31.345 --> 00:34.914
What seems to have gathered
so many interested parties?

00:34.982 --> 00:37.183
Fire department found
Jane Doe this morning.

00:37.251 --> 00:39.352
Looks like she was strangled
sometime last night.

00:39.420 --> 00:42.121
And all interested parties have been
assured results from your team.

00:42.188 --> 00:44.856
Ha, ha, well...
We appreciate the confidence.

00:44.924 --> 00:48.494
I just don't understand why a Jane Doe
would draw the attention of the IIB.

00:48.561 --> 00:50.962
You will.

00:55.301 --> 00:58.802
Could be a one-off, or the
ritual could indicate a pattern.

00:58.870 --> 01:03.040
Either way, the press are gonna run
wild with this. Hold my coffee.

01:11.950 --> 01:14.884
Can I borrow that? Thank you.

01:26.664 --> 01:28.998
Gonna need more
of this. Thank you.

01:53.342 --> 01:54.302
Whoa, okay.

01:54.378 --> 01:56.978
- How did you not tell me about this?
- My father told me

01:57.046 --> 01:59.514
- it was impolite to brag.
- Well, I disagree.

01:59.582 --> 02:01.550
I'm gonna brag for you.
You know what?

02:01.617 --> 02:03.951
I'm gonna have to introduce you
as my girlfriend, Tia Tremblay,

02:04.019 --> 02:06.087
the National Newspaper
Award nominee.

02:06.155 --> 02:09.157
- That sounds really good.
- You like that, right? Congratulations.

02:09.225 --> 02:12.607
Thank you. Toby, I wouldn't have broken
the Levinson story without your help.

02:12.727 --> 02:14.961
- You happy?
- Yeah.

02:15.029 --> 02:17.030
I'm happy.

02:17.098 --> 02:19.399
- Good.
- Alright.

02:19.466 --> 02:22.069
- You know what else my dad used to say?
- What?

02:22.136 --> 02:24.771
You can be happy at home
or work, but not both.

02:24.839 --> 02:26.673
Tough man, your dad.

02:26.741 --> 02:29.108
Highly pragmatic.

02:29.176 --> 02:31.110
Maybe he was wrong
about that one.

02:31.178 --> 02:33.445
Maybe.

02:33.513 --> 02:36.215
But he told the truth
as he saw it.

02:36.282 --> 02:39.518
And that's what I've tried
to do too. Which is, of course,

02:39.586 --> 02:41.620
what's made me a National
Newspaper Award Nominee.

02:41.740 --> 02:44.889
I like this. This is bragging.
This is how you gotta do it.

02:44.957 --> 02:48.226
But seriously...

02:48.293 --> 02:51.029
I'm glad you're not scared off
by my telling the truth.

02:51.097 --> 02:54.099
You know, like talking
about my epilepsy.

02:54.166 --> 02:56.667
It scared a lot of
other guys, so...

02:56.736 --> 02:59.904
- Thank you for being so accepting.
- Sure.

02:59.972 --> 03:03.440
Not having any secrets makes
me feel so much closer to you.

03:06.177 --> 03:10.013
So, the omelette of the day
is looking pretty good.

03:10.081 --> 03:12.482
What do you think?

03:12.550 --> 03:14.618
Up to you.

03:14.685 --> 03:18.154
Maybe surprise me.

03:23.293 --> 03:25.862
Strung up and surrounded
by a ring of fire.

03:25.929 --> 03:28.030
I could barely get past
the reporters downstairs.

03:28.098 --> 03:30.032
Well, it's a 24-hour
news cycle.

03:30.100 --> 03:32.034
A ritualistic killing
like this feeds the beast.

03:32.102 --> 03:34.069
Which is why we have
to move quickly,

03:34.137 --> 03:36.104
before the press whips
the public into a frenzy.

03:36.172 --> 03:38.073
So, what do we know
about the victim?

03:38.141 --> 03:41.042
Well, the M.E. puts our Jane
Doe at around 30 years old.

03:41.110 --> 03:43.912
There's no prints on file and
no match with missing persons.

03:43.980 --> 03:46.014
- Anything from the canvass?
- Not yet,

03:46.082 --> 03:49.416
but Superintendent Martell
has pre-approved overtime.

03:49.484 --> 03:51.385
- Really?
- If she was at the crime scene,

03:51.452 --> 03:53.687
there's a political agenda
at work. I'm not saying I know

03:53.755 --> 03:55.823
where the mines are buried,
but be careful where you step.

03:55.891 --> 03:59.126
Okay, so there was no sign of sexual assault,
even though the body was found naked?

03:59.194 --> 04:01.428
MmHmm.
Seems odd, doesn't it?

04:01.496 --> 04:04.098
Many serial killers do it
simply for the thrill.

04:04.166 --> 04:07.566
If it was the work of a serial killer.
I've got Dev cross-checking the M.O.

04:07.634 --> 04:11.337
with the North American database.
What do you have for us, Corporal?

04:11.405 --> 04:14.140
The M.O. doesn't match any
in the serial killer database.

04:14.208 --> 04:17.476
So I think we need to rule
that out. Lighting a fire,

04:17.543 --> 04:20.512
and a public placement of the body... is the
killer just trying to display his work?

04:20.579 --> 04:23.548
Well, flaunting the kill implies a
confidence that they won't be caught.

04:23.616 --> 04:25.383
Well, let's prove him wrong,
shall we?

04:25.451 --> 04:27.752
The killer could just
as easily be a female.

04:27.821 --> 04:30.022
What does forensics tell us?

04:30.089 --> 04:31.890
The killer is organized.

04:31.958 --> 04:33.826
I would say they were working
in their comfort zone,

04:33.893 --> 04:36.594
somewhere close to a residence
or a place of employment.

04:36.662 --> 04:39.221
If we're gonna be building a profile,
we should start with the victim.

04:39.341 --> 04:41.360
Dev's right.
Let's start by identifying the Jane Doe.

04:41.480 --> 04:44.483
Well, she had a lot of ink. Maybe
we can track down her tattoo artist.

04:44.603 --> 04:45.317
Ah.

04:45.437 --> 04:48.472
Well, I thought you'd say that.

04:48.540 --> 04:51.309
So I've been bouncing around
body modification chat rooms

04:51.376 --> 04:53.865
and cross-referencing the work
with local artist portfolios.

04:53.985 --> 04:56.779
And I believe this is
the work of one Zoe Davis.

04:56.848 --> 04:59.883
- I'll pick up Toby on the way.
- I'll send you the address.

05:12.762 --> 05:15.697
Excuse me? We just need
to ask you a few questions.

05:15.765 --> 05:18.254
- I'm just in the middle of a sleeve.
- This won't take long.

05:19.936 --> 05:22.671
- Is this your work?
- Yeah.

05:22.739 --> 05:26.140
- Know this woman?
- Oh my god, Kelly...

05:26.208 --> 05:30.478
- Do you know Kelly's last name?
- No, I don't.

05:30.545 --> 05:33.248
That's a lot of ink. That must
have taken years, no?

05:33.315 --> 05:36.617
Well, I didn't know her that long.
We did all that in 12 months.

05:36.685 --> 05:39.453
- That's a bit unusual, isn't it?
- She was unusual.

05:39.521 --> 05:41.989
- In what way?
- Well, most people

05:42.056 --> 05:45.425
use the tattoo chair like a shrink's couch.
Kelly barely talked.

05:51.599 --> 05:53.700
Was she emotional?
Did she cry?

05:53.768 --> 05:57.169
Oh, a lot of people do.
Tattoos can act as a catharsis.

05:57.237 --> 05:59.205
Did she ever come
in here with anyone?

05:59.273 --> 06:03.342
Did she mention where she works
or a place that she hangs out?

06:03.410 --> 06:06.912
I saw her once at the Vice Bar. Maybe
someone there can help you out.

06:06.979 --> 06:09.480
- Do you know if she had a boyfriend?
- I don't think she had one.

06:09.548 --> 06:13.618
I don't want to gossip. Anything
that you can tell us is gonna help.

06:13.685 --> 06:16.854
Um, she always had a lot
of cash and tipped well.

06:16.923 --> 06:19.090
I overheard her
on the phone once,

06:19.158 --> 06:22.060
talking quietly to a client
about meeting at a hotel.

06:22.128 --> 06:23.694
What are you saying?

06:23.762 --> 06:26.864
I think she might
have been an escort.

06:26.932 --> 06:28.966
Vice Bar's been
around for years.

06:29.034 --> 06:32.136
It's a very wide-open clientele.
We'll go check that out.

06:32.203 --> 06:34.318
Kelly was crying when she got
her phoenix tattoo.

06:34.438 --> 06:36.474
Yeah. That much ink would bring
anyone to tears.

06:36.594 --> 06:37.790
It's emotional, not physical.

06:37.910 --> 06:41.478
- Dev. What's going on?
<I>- Striations and fibers on the neck</I>

06:41.546 --> 06:44.147
are consistent with
a braided leather strap.

06:44.214 --> 06:46.249
The thickness and
imprint of a clasp

06:46.317 --> 06:48.251
suggest that a necklace
was the murder weapon.

06:48.319 --> 06:49.312
Anything else?

06:49.432 --> 06:51.606
The scratches on her heels
and rope marks on her wrists

06:51.726 --> 06:52.989
are post-mortem.

06:53.057 --> 06:55.123
She was killed somewhere else and
then brought to the stairwell.

06:55.191 --> 06:58.226
Okay, we have a partial ID on our victim.
Her first name was Kelly.

06:58.294 --> 07:01.129
We have reason to believe she was
an escort, so run it by Vice.

07:01.197 --> 07:03.666
We got a lead from her tattoo
artist we're gonna check out now.

07:03.733 --> 07:05.668
Okay. Bye.

07:13.943 --> 07:17.211
Hey. Can you turn it down?

07:17.279 --> 07:20.815
I can't hear you!
Isn't that great?

07:27.856 --> 07:29.857
You're Johnny Willard, right?

07:29.924 --> 07:32.498
The cops are really
classing up their visits.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.461
I know the bylaws...

07:34.529 --> 07:36.897
you can't execute a noise
complaint during the day.

07:36.965 --> 07:39.466
We're IIB, we're not Metro.
We're here to ask you

07:39.534 --> 07:43.002
about a customer of yours.
Her name's Kelly.

07:43.069 --> 07:45.798
We found her in a stairwell
a block from here.

07:45.918 --> 07:47.607
You know her?

07:59.018 --> 08:01.219
We, uh...

08:01.286 --> 08:04.890
dated on and off
for a couple months.

08:04.957 --> 08:08.793
- What's Kelly's last name?
- She never gave me a last name.

08:08.861 --> 08:10.562
Is that because
you paid for your dates?

08:13.365 --> 08:15.566
- What?
- Your bar has a reputation.

08:15.634 --> 08:17.735
And we have reason to believe
that she was an escort.

08:17.802 --> 08:19.770
You wanna knock my bar,
that's fine.

08:19.838 --> 08:22.573
Anyone who pays
for a drink is welcome.

08:22.641 --> 08:24.909
But don't drag Kelly
through the dirt.

08:24.976 --> 08:26.677
Why else wouldn't she
give her last name?

08:26.745 --> 08:28.879
Because she was private.

08:28.947 --> 08:30.948
Not a single photo
in her apartment.

08:31.016 --> 08:32.615
Where were you
last night at 10?

08:32.683 --> 08:35.184
You accusing me of something?

08:35.253 --> 08:36.818
Not yet.

08:36.886 --> 08:38.888
I was here till three.

08:38.956 --> 08:40.623
When was the last time
you saw her?

08:42.025 --> 08:44.561
I saw her a couple weeks ago.
Nothing since.

08:44.628 --> 08:46.996
- Did she leave you?
- She broke it off, yeah.

08:47.064 --> 08:50.199
- You know if she was seeing someone else?
- There might have been a guy.

08:50.267 --> 08:52.768
Came in here one night.

08:55.205 --> 08:57.373
- Why are you here?
- Get outta here!

08:57.441 --> 08:59.308
Who the hell was that?

08:59.376 --> 09:02.644
She said she didn't know him.
I thought she was lying.

09:02.712 --> 09:05.485
We're gonna need
Kelly's address.

09:12.521 --> 09:14.589
So I saw the guy

09:14.656 --> 09:16.724
Johnny saw with Kelly.
He got rough with him.

09:16.792 --> 09:19.193
I can do a composite with Dev.

09:19.260 --> 09:22.196
Geographically, Johnny would work.
Kelly's apartment is a block from here.

09:22.263 --> 09:25.699
Alright. I saw her wearing a braided necklace.
It could be the murder weapon.

09:25.766 --> 09:29.470
Hopefully her apartment
gives us some answers.

09:41.115 --> 09:44.283
Johnny was right.
No photos, no personal effects.

09:46.253 --> 09:50.323
Check this out.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.597
- The shower curtain's missing.
- Maybe they wrapped her body in it.

09:58.664 --> 10:02.467
We'll get forensics in here.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.936
The property manager
downstairs said that the rent

10:05.004 --> 10:07.804
was paid each month with a credit
card belonging to a food company.

10:07.872 --> 10:11.108
So maybe one of her executives
is paying for this place.

10:11.176 --> 10:13.744
Right. Maybe the guy
that Johnny saw with Kelly?

10:13.811 --> 10:15.746
He puts her up here,

10:15.813 --> 10:18.715
anytime he's away on business,
Kelly brings in Johnny.

10:18.783 --> 10:20.817
He finds out, he kills her.

10:20.885 --> 10:22.819
What's the name of that company?

10:22.887 --> 10:26.389
- Cloud 9 Organics.
- Let's go.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.110
We need to talk to whoever's in charge
of the corporate credit cards.

10:34.230 --> 10:36.633
I've got this, Trish.
Hi, Brent Sanders, CFO.

10:36.700 --> 10:39.868
Oh, and this is
Jennifer Cowell, Co-CEO.

10:39.935 --> 10:42.638
I'm Sergeant McCluskey, this
is Special Consultant Logan.

10:42.705 --> 10:44.906
We need to know who
uses this credit card.

10:46.976 --> 10:49.311
This is an exclusive card. Only
my partner and I have these.

10:49.379 --> 10:51.446
That's great. Is he here?
Can we speak to him?

10:51.514 --> 10:54.616
Her. Sarah's actually
not in the office yet.

10:54.736 --> 10:55.970
Okay, well, we'll wait.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.732
Well, is there something
we can help you with?

10:57.852 --> 11:01.055
- Is this her?
- Yes, that's my partner.

11:04.159 --> 11:06.827
She's also our victim.

11:11.323 --> 11:16.075
Sarah and I grew up together.
Prep school at Kingston, U of T.

11:16.195 --> 11:20.525
After we got our MBAs at Rotman
we started Cloud 9 Organics.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.481
Sarah and Jen made Cloud 9

11:23.549 --> 11:25.716
the biggest organic food
supplier in the whole country.

11:25.836 --> 11:29.722
- Brent, I've got this.
- Okay.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.414
Were you aware
that Sarah was using

11:31.534 --> 11:33.501
the corporate credit card to pay
for her apartment?

11:33.621 --> 11:34.623
What apartment?

11:34.743 --> 11:36.644
Sarah owns a home
in Forest Hill.

11:36.712 --> 11:40.015
- She was living a life of contradiction.
- What makes you say that?

11:40.083 --> 11:43.018
Well, how she spent her off-
work hours. Her appearance.

11:43.086 --> 11:45.454
The only way that
we could identify her

11:45.521 --> 11:48.023
was from her tattoos.
It's not often that you see

11:48.091 --> 11:50.124
a CEO with that much ink.

11:52.961 --> 11:54.658
She always covered up at work.

11:54.778 --> 11:57.153
So you didn't know
she was so heavily tattooed?

12:02.937 --> 12:05.706
- No.
- But you knew that she had some work done?

12:05.773 --> 12:07.974
As our business grew,
Sarah became distant.

12:08.042 --> 12:10.210
I knew her less and less.

12:10.277 --> 12:14.347
- Did you two have conflicts?
- Nothing meaningful. <i>I tried to warn her.</i>

12:16.398 --> 12:18.723
Were there any personal issues
that you were aware of?

12:18.843 --> 12:20.101
Sarah's parents died

12:20.221 --> 12:21.643
about a year ago.

12:21.763 --> 12:25.224
She would disappear
for days at a time.

12:25.291 --> 12:27.779
Maybe the tattoos were
a reaction to their death.

12:27.977 --> 12:30.679
She was known as "Kelly"
in some circles.

12:30.747 --> 12:33.081
Did you know anything
about this?

12:38.421 --> 12:40.188
I have no idea
why she would do that.

12:40.256 --> 12:43.224
- And where were you last night?
- I went to bed early.

12:43.292 --> 12:45.526
We're going to need
Sarah's laptop.

12:48.196 --> 12:51.332
She's lying. She knew
about the tattoos.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.367
<i>She went by "Kelly"</i>

12:53.435 --> 12:55.202
in some circles.
But our victim's name

12:55.270 --> 12:58.572
is Sarah Wembley. Now, Sarah was
involved in a volatile relationship

12:58.640 --> 13:01.107
with Johnny Willard,
the owner of the Vice Bar.

13:01.175 --> 13:03.176
We're looking into
his alibi from last night.

13:03.243 --> 13:05.378
And we've got a team of forensics
at Sarah's home in Forest Hill.

13:05.446 --> 13:08.481
I saw Johnny pushing a guy,
may have been Sarah's lover.

13:08.549 --> 13:11.117
Unfortunately, our composite

13:11.185 --> 13:13.186
doesn't match anything
in the criminal database

13:13.253 --> 13:16.655
- or the corporate files at Cloud 9.
- We asked Jennifer about Sarah

13:16.723 --> 13:19.525
using the name "Kelly",
and I saw something burning.

13:19.592 --> 13:22.961
And Jennifer says she doesn't know anything
about Sarah's tattoos, but in your read,

13:23.029 --> 13:26.765
you saw her watching Sarah
get the flames inked.

13:26.833 --> 13:30.469
- And Jen doesn't have an alibi.
- So, we got flames on the victim's back,

13:30.537 --> 13:33.233
we got flames from Jen,
and we got flames at the scene.

13:33.353 --> 13:34.786
I think they gotta be connected.

13:34.906 --> 13:38.576
Do you think she's capable of stringing up
the body of her dead friend and lighting

13:38.644 --> 13:39.816
a ring of fire around it?

13:39.936 --> 13:41.827
 Yeah, physically,
I'd say she's strong enough.

13:41.947 --> 13:44.915
Or she hired our mystery man
and the ritual's just his thing.

13:44.983 --> 13:48.552
I'll look into her computer and see if it can
tell us anything about their relationship.

13:48.619 --> 13:52.356
Okay. Talk to the tattoo artist
again, specifically about the flames.

13:52.423 --> 13:54.391
Let's see if Jennifer Cowell

13:54.459 --> 13:57.060
would hate our victim enough
to string her up in a stairwell.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.628
Okay.

14:04.234 --> 14:07.703
It's gonna look great.

14:07.771 --> 14:10.272
- You're back.
- Yeah.

14:10.340 --> 14:12.842
You mentioned that Kelly's tattoos
may have been a catharsis.

14:12.909 --> 14:16.579
- Can you tell us more about this one?
- Well, she cried a lot during our sessions.

14:16.646 --> 14:19.147
I mean, I asked if she wanted to stop,
and she said she needed to get it out.

14:19.215 --> 14:21.549
To get what out?

14:21.617 --> 14:23.017
Did she ever say what it meant?

14:23.085 --> 14:25.253
Nothing specific.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.489
She wanted something that
represented transformation

14:27.556 --> 14:29.991
and the phoenix is rising
from its own ashes.

14:30.058 --> 14:31.341
And these?

14:31.461 --> 14:34.310
Oh, a snake is our negative selves.
The tiger, courage.

14:34.430 --> 14:37.698
She wanted something that represented
her courage to defeat her darker self.

14:37.766 --> 14:40.734
I didn't think of it before,

14:40.802 --> 14:43.200
but you guys aren't the first ones
to ask about her ink.

14:43.320 --> 14:44.303
Who else did?

14:49.143 --> 14:51.211
I didn't get his name,

14:51.279 --> 14:54.046
but he saw the phoenix
on her at a bar.

14:54.114 --> 14:56.148
- Our mystery man.
- What did he want?

14:56.216 --> 14:58.751
He wanted to get one like it.
Wanted to know what it symbolized.

14:58.819 --> 15:00.653
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

15:00.721 --> 15:02.722
Well, if this mystery guy
was her lover,

15:02.790 --> 15:06.191
why did he ask about her
tattoos? Maybe it's a stalker?

15:07.594 --> 15:10.892
So I looked into Cloud 9 and I couldn't
find any fires connected to them.

15:11.012 --> 15:12.922
But the company's
grown exponentially

15:13.042 --> 15:14.451
in the past 3 years.

15:14.571 --> 15:17.318
So someone there might have
motive to cut Sarah out.

15:17.438 --> 15:18.938
Did you get anything
from her laptop?

15:19.005 --> 15:22.674
Yeah, they're going to sell the company
to Largo Markets, it's a grocery chain.

15:22.742 --> 15:25.810
The deal is on the table
as we speak and Sarah's emails

15:25.877 --> 15:28.179
have her going back and forth
with Jen, just arguing about it.

15:28.247 --> 15:30.248
- And Jen never mentioned it?
- No.

15:30.316 --> 15:32.683
We need to find out how
Sarah's death affects that deal.

15:35.921 --> 15:38.389
We need to speak with Jen.

15:38.457 --> 15:41.291
She's away making
funeral arrangements.

15:41.359 --> 15:42.681
Of course.

15:42.801 --> 15:44.608
You guys are selling to Largo Markets,
is that right?

15:44.728 --> 15:46.663
Yeah, it's still up in the
air, but they want to acquire us

15:46.730 --> 15:48.832
and make Cloud 9 their
in-house organics brand.

15:48.899 --> 15:51.435
Was there any tension
between Jen and Sarah

15:51.502 --> 15:53.303
over whether or not to sell?

15:53.371 --> 15:55.005
The numbers aren't right.
We're not selling.

15:55.073 --> 15:56.772
How would you know?
You're never here.

15:59.176 --> 16:01.043
They were always aligned.

16:01.111 --> 16:03.145
That's what made
this company a success.

16:03.213 --> 16:05.647
We heard that Jen
resented Sarah's absence.

16:05.715 --> 16:08.284
Did you know anything
about her personal life?

16:08.352 --> 16:10.286
Any debates that
Sarah and Jen had

16:10.354 --> 16:13.088
were simply business partners
discussing business.

16:13.155 --> 16:15.712
I'd like you to forward us
that deal memo.

16:16.558 --> 16:19.716
- Or we could get a warrant.
- I'll send you the documents,

16:19.836 --> 16:22.830
just please keep them confidential.
We still have a deal on the table.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.443
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

16:24.563 --> 16:27.969
He saw Jen and Sarah arguing.
I think Jen resented Sarah

16:28.036 --> 16:30.337
- for carrying the business.
- Dev, what's going on?

16:30.405 --> 16:32.572
We have forensics from Sarah's
anonymous apartment...

16:32.640 --> 16:34.942
- she was definitely killed there.
- Did we canvass the building?

16:35.062 --> 16:37.198
Yeah, a neighbour said they heard
someone leave at 11,

16:37.318 --> 16:40.047
and that's an hour after her death.
But there's more.

16:40.882 --> 16:43.450
Vice Bar's staff has Johnny coming
in late to work last night...

16:43.518 --> 16:45.485
12 o'clock. But a red light cam

16:45.552 --> 16:48.687
ticketed his SUV around
Sarah's apartment at 11:15.

16:48.755 --> 16:52.525
Okay, we're gonna go
talk to him. Thanks.

17:05.771 --> 17:07.805
Looks like Johnny's
drowning his guilt.

17:11.777 --> 17:13.810
Hey.

17:13.878 --> 17:16.513
We need to ask you a few more
questions about Sarah Wembley.

17:16.580 --> 17:18.848
- Who?
- "Kelly".

17:18.916 --> 17:21.617
I get it.

17:21.685 --> 17:24.155
Developers want me
out of business

17:24.222 --> 17:26.790
and framing me makes it
easy to shut me down.

17:26.858 --> 17:29.593
I'm not going anywhere.

17:29.661 --> 17:31.795
Actually, yes, you are.

17:39.236 --> 17:41.771
My place, my rules!

17:41.838 --> 17:43.739
You don't want it
to go down like this, man.

17:43.807 --> 17:46.376
It's only gonna
make you look guilty.

17:46.444 --> 17:48.710
Make room.

17:48.778 --> 17:50.779
I got nothing to hide.

18:05.511 --> 18:07.445
<i>You people are unbelievable.</i>

18:07.513 --> 18:09.447
<i>Developers can't buy me out,</i>

18:09.515 --> 18:11.983
<i>so they charge me with murder.</i>

18:12.050 --> 18:14.986
They won't stop till they clear the
whole block for strollers and yoga.

18:15.053 --> 18:17.489
Your alibi is weak, Johnny.

18:17.556 --> 18:19.556
People at your bar say that you
didn't show up until midnight,

18:19.624 --> 18:21.558
that's well past
when Sarah was killed.

18:21.626 --> 18:24.895
It's a crowded spot. Tough
to know who gets there when.

18:24.962 --> 18:27.364
This was taken
outside Sarah's place

18:27.432 --> 18:29.500
shortly after her time of death.

18:29.567 --> 18:33.170
- We also found rope in your SUV.
- Is that a crime?

18:33.237 --> 18:35.838
Yeah, if it's used
to string up her body.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.073
If we search your place and find
the leather necklace that was used

18:38.141 --> 18:41.711
to kill her, it's all gonna be
over for you.

18:41.779 --> 18:45.581
I didn't kill Kelly. Or Sarah,
or whatever her name was.

18:47.150 --> 18:50.819
When you're on the stand, I would try to
rein in that temper just a little bit.

18:53.122 --> 18:56.591
Listen, I'm pissed.

18:56.659 --> 19:00.495
She didn't tell me her real name or
anything about her company. And now this.

19:00.563 --> 19:02.997
I thought you two were just seeing each other?
I thought it wasn't serious?

19:03.065 --> 19:04.833
- I wanted more.
- But she didn't.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.701
- That's not it.
- So then what happened?

19:08.804 --> 19:11.672
- It's a fire! It's a fire!
- Shh! It's okay... It's okay.

19:11.740 --> 19:13.807
Get out! Get out!

19:13.875 --> 19:16.509
She woke up screaming
about some fire.

19:16.577 --> 19:19.646
I told her it didn't matter what
it was, I wanted to hear about it.

19:19.714 --> 19:22.216
- I'd be there for her.
- And?

19:22.283 --> 19:24.218
She told me

19:24.285 --> 19:26.486
she was seeing someone else.

19:29.622 --> 19:33.292
- Wonderful.
<i>- Okay, let's go through this again.</i>

19:42.970 --> 19:45.370
I understand you have Sarah
Wembley's killer in custody.

19:45.437 --> 19:49.107
I understand that there's a reason
to hurry to that conclusion.

19:49.175 --> 19:52.443
I assume you're referring to the red-light
photo of Johnny leaving the crime scene.

19:54.313 --> 19:56.181
Alvin,

19:56.249 --> 19:58.283
I'd appreciate it
if you brought charges

19:58.351 --> 20:00.551
against Mr. Willard
as quickly as possible.

20:00.619 --> 20:02.587
I can only respond
to the facts of the case.

20:02.654 --> 20:04.955
So, when you find the murder
weapon in his possession,

20:05.023 --> 20:07.458
I trust you'll...
you'll act accordingly.

20:07.526 --> 20:09.861
When or if.

20:09.928 --> 20:11.596
Come on,

20:11.663 --> 20:13.931
we both know that
Johnny Willard's prosecution

20:13.999 --> 20:16.133
will serve certain developers
with interests

20:16.201 --> 20:20.504
in the area. This bar
will close and some careers

20:20.571 --> 20:21.650
will be made along the way.

20:21.770 --> 20:24.908
That is a dangerous assumption.

20:26.577 --> 20:28.214
I expect to see charges laid.

20:28.334 --> 20:31.581
We will prosecute Johnny to
the fullest extent of the law.

20:35.084 --> 20:37.986
If he's guilty.

20:38.054 --> 20:40.088
<i>Sarah was killed at 10.</i>

20:40.156 --> 20:44.326
You were seen in her neighbourhood at 11:15
and then you showed up at the bar at 12.

20:44.446 --> 20:46.483
That would have given you
plenty of time.

20:46.603 --> 20:47.711
I didn't kill her.

20:47.831 --> 20:51.599
You said she screamed about a fire...
did she ever talk about what her ink meant?

20:51.667 --> 20:54.936
No. I told you
she was private.

20:55.003 --> 20:56.805
Snake stands for negativity,

20:56.872 --> 21:00.475
the tiger courage. Maybe
Sarah finally got the courage

21:00.543 --> 21:02.777
- to get rid of you?
- That doesn't mean I killed her.

21:02.845 --> 21:04.612
Then why did you show up
at her apartment?

21:12.620 --> 21:14.621
We've got a witness
who puts you in the lobby.

21:14.689 --> 21:18.992
The best play is
the truth here, Johnny.

21:19.060 --> 21:21.994
I wanted to talk things out,

21:22.062 --> 21:24.464
but I lost my nerve to buzz her.

21:24.531 --> 21:27.232
So you never actually
were inside her apartment?

21:30.838 --> 21:34.674
I was downstairs
when he killed her.

21:34.741 --> 21:38.577
If I would have buzzed her,
she might be alive.

21:41.413 --> 21:43.882
- Hey.
- What did you get from Johnny?

21:43.950 --> 21:45.884
Well, he admits that he was
at her building last night

21:45.952 --> 21:48.487
but says that he didn't actually
buzz up to her apartment.

21:48.554 --> 21:51.857
Well, let's see if Sarah's DNA shows up
in his SUV, and if the rope matches.

21:51.924 --> 21:53.991
Maybe Sarah's stalker
showed up last night?

21:54.058 --> 21:57.227
Hey, I think I got something.
I checked out the deal memo

21:57.295 --> 22:00.397
and corporate structure. Sarah had a
controlling interest in the company,

22:00.465 --> 22:02.900
- but now all her shares are sold to Jen.
- Sarah didn't want to sell.

22:02.968 --> 22:05.068
She didn't get a chance
to sign the deal memo.

22:05.136 --> 22:08.271
Or maybe she wouldn't. Taking
control over a company this large,

22:08.339 --> 22:10.373
that would
definitely be motive.

22:10.440 --> 22:13.510
But Johnny's our prime suspect while
we try to recover the murder weapon.

22:13.577 --> 22:17.013
Okay, well, we'll go talk to her first thing
in the morning, because as you always say...

22:17.080 --> 22:19.248
Follow the money.

22:30.026 --> 22:32.661
Hey.

22:32.729 --> 22:36.297
- Hey. Breakfast for dinner?
- You don't mind, do you?

22:36.417 --> 22:37.264
Nah.

22:37.384 --> 22:39.431
I didn't have time to buy groceries
and there's a shocking lack

22:39.551 --> 22:43.070
- of cereal-delivery places in this town.
- At least you saved some for me. Thank you.

22:43.138 --> 22:46.541
Yeah, all you had left was this
cranberry-flaxseed stuff that Tia left here.

22:46.608 --> 22:48.128
- It's totally for girls.
- It's good stuff.

22:48.248 --> 22:49.758
Speaking of your lady friend,

22:49.878 --> 22:51.946
pretty cool.
"Tia Tremblay nominated

22:52.014 --> 22:55.149
- for a National Newspaper Award."
- She's a good writer. She deserves it.

22:57.019 --> 22:58.457
What's the matter?
You're not that happy with it?

22:58.577 --> 22:59.700
No, I am. I'm just, you know,

22:59.820 --> 23:02.022
wondering when she's gonna
start digging into my story.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.958
Oh, you think it might be time
to reveal the Logan secret?

23:05.026 --> 23:07.827
No. It's been the death
of every relationship

23:07.895 --> 23:09.863
I've ever had. Present
company excluded.

23:09.931 --> 23:12.265
Well, you care
about her, right?

23:12.332 --> 23:14.266
- Yeah.
- You trust her?

23:14.333 --> 23:15.213
Yeah.

23:15.333 --> 23:18.804
Then it might be time to say,
honey, I'm a telepath.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.707
Can you pass the milk?

23:21.775 --> 23:24.710
- I don't know, I mean...
- Can you actually pass the milk, please?

23:24.778 --> 23:28.047
It's rude to reach
across. Thank you.

23:28.114 --> 23:30.048
At this point,
why would I tell her?

23:30.115 --> 23:32.050
- It's been so long.
- Belated truth.

23:32.117 --> 23:34.118
I mean, when
your worlds collide,

23:34.186 --> 23:36.854
how do you brace for impact? Better men
than us have failed to answer that.

23:36.922 --> 23:38.756
- But they've probably phrased it better.
- Hey,

23:38.824 --> 23:42.259
you're gettin' some sage advice for
the low price of a bowl of cereal.

23:44.118 --> 23:45.796
You serious?

23:45.863 --> 23:48.241
Okay, all-day breakfast
on me. Come on.

23:48.361 --> 23:52.268
I'll take you to a place where the grease
fills every nook and cranny in your mouth.

24:04.547 --> 24:07.282
- We need to talk.
- I'm afraid I have a meeting.

24:07.350 --> 24:09.619
Sarah's shares transfer
to you now that she's dead.

24:09.686 --> 24:12.989
Yes, they do. And I don't
appreciate the insinuation.

24:13.056 --> 24:16.025
You actually think I killed my
best friend and strung her up?

24:16.093 --> 24:18.594
With that much money on the line,
we don't rule anything out.

24:18.661 --> 24:20.996
And you said that she had distanced
herself from the friendship.

24:21.063 --> 24:23.031
- This is ridiculous.
- We know that you two

24:23.099 --> 24:25.300
- fought about whether or not to sell.
- Yes, we did.

24:25.368 --> 24:27.236
We fought all the time,
we were like sisters.

24:27.303 --> 24:29.438
We'd been in business together
since we were 15.

24:29.506 --> 24:31.373
Was there ever
a fire at Cloud 9?

24:36.378 --> 24:39.981
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You can tell us, Jen.

24:40.049 --> 24:42.951
<i>They can't know.</i>
You're not making any sense.

24:43.019 --> 24:44.686
No, we know about the fire.

24:44.754 --> 24:48.156
<i>He's inside! Jen, he's</i>
<i>inside!</i>

24:50.526 --> 24:52.126
Who was inside the fire?

24:52.193 --> 24:54.828
Sorry to interrupt.

24:54.896 --> 24:56.830
We could use you
at the conference table.

24:56.898 --> 24:59.566
We have to finalize that
counter offer by 10 a.m.

24:59.634 --> 25:02.269
- If you'll excuse me.
- You're going through with the sale?

25:02.336 --> 25:05.673
Jen wants a little more
than they're offering right now,

25:05.740 --> 25:09.075
but I have every confidence
we'll arrive at the right price.

25:11.011 --> 25:14.113
That's even more incentive
if you own all the shares.

25:14.181 --> 25:16.749
Right.

25:18.986 --> 25:21.353
Jen thought of the flames
tattooed on Sarah again.

25:21.421 --> 25:23.354
This time there was
a "K" in them.

25:23.422 --> 25:25.323
So whether she hired someone
or acted alone,

25:25.391 --> 25:27.358
- Jen looks good for it.
- This is about

25:27.426 --> 25:31.029
more than the deal. They promised to keep
a secret about someone trapped in a fire.

25:31.097 --> 25:34.432
Maybe Jen killed her before
Sarah could come clean about it?

25:34.500 --> 25:36.306
Can you blame Sarah
for wanting to talk?

25:36.426 --> 25:39.004
Imagine having to keep it
a secret for so long.

25:39.437 --> 25:43.074
I know how she feels. You
thinking about telling Tia?

25:43.141 --> 25:45.976
I don't know.

25:46.044 --> 25:48.645
I'm all for openness, right,

25:48.714 --> 25:52.416
but there are some things that are
probably better kept a secret.

25:55.720 --> 25:59.189
<i>A suspect, I grant you,</i>

25:59.256 --> 26:03.093
but lying about their past and Sarah's
tattoos doesn't mean Jen did it.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.829
The flames connect to the way
Sarah's body was found, I know it.

26:05.896 --> 26:09.699
Look, you said when Toby read the
tattoo artist, he saw our mystery man

26:09.767 --> 26:12.134
asking about Sarah's phoenix.

26:12.202 --> 26:15.104
So maybe he connects to the
flames, or someone else does.

26:15.171 --> 26:18.673
The point is, when it comes to Sarah's
murder, all of this is circumstantial.

26:18.742 --> 26:21.409
Did the search of Johnny's
property turn up anything?

26:21.477 --> 26:24.246
His rope doesn't match and there was
no murder weapon found at his place.

26:24.313 --> 26:26.248
Nothing in his SUV,

26:26.315 --> 26:28.549
but his DNA's all over
Sarah's apartment.

26:28.617 --> 26:31.753
That is not surprising
because they were lovers.

26:31.820 --> 26:34.355
Jen said that she was home
the night of the murder.

26:34.422 --> 26:36.858
Did we look into her?

26:36.925 --> 26:40.294
Get Dev to take a hard look into Jen's
background. Let's see what he can find.

26:40.362 --> 26:43.864
See, I knew you were
gonna say that.

26:43.931 --> 26:46.432
Dev. What do you have?

26:46.500 --> 26:48.869
Well, Jen said she went
to prep school with Sarah.

26:48.936 --> 26:51.537
So I found their
online yearbook.

26:51.605 --> 26:55.541
And this memorial for a Kelly.

26:55.609 --> 26:59.145
Kelly Lerman. The same name
that Sarah used for her alias.

26:59.212 --> 27:02.314
What's Sarah's comments there?
It says, "MH,

27:02.382 --> 27:05.084
- the debt can never be repaid."
- Who's MH?

27:05.152 --> 27:07.920
I may be able to
answer that, actually.

27:07.988 --> 27:09.989
Kelly Lerman burned to death

27:10.056 --> 27:12.057
in a marijuana grow-op fire.

27:12.125 --> 27:14.426
Evidence suggested that
other people were involved,

27:14.494 --> 27:16.861
but only one guy went down
for it. This guy.

27:16.929 --> 27:20.431
- Max Howzer. He was 20 at the time.
- Max Howzer.

27:20.551 --> 27:21.165
"MH".

27:21.285 --> 27:23.268
The article says that
the neighbours suspected

27:23.335 --> 27:26.004
satanic worship was going on
at the house before it burned.

27:26.071 --> 27:28.506
Max is doing time
at Kingston Pen.

27:28.573 --> 27:31.942
Dev, can you pull up
Sarah's phoenix tattoo?

27:32.010 --> 27:33.911
Yeah. Why?

27:35.213 --> 27:38.115
Okay, look there. Look
at the bottom by her spine.

27:38.183 --> 27:40.117
The lines in the flames bled.

27:40.185 --> 27:42.119
The pigment is
different as well.

27:42.187 --> 27:45.189
- So?
- So the tattoo was older.

27:45.256 --> 27:47.190
Probably done by
a different tattoo artist.

27:47.257 --> 27:49.192
You know what, give me
a second. I might be able

27:49.259 --> 27:51.360
to isolate it based
on the pigment...

27:55.498 --> 27:57.566
There.

27:59.169 --> 28:01.270
So Toby read Jen

28:01.338 --> 28:03.205
watching Sarah get
this tattoo, and then Sarah

28:03.272 --> 28:05.273
promising to keep
something a secret.

28:05.341 --> 28:07.475
Okay, ideas anyone?

28:07.543 --> 28:10.411
Was Jen somehow responsible
for Kelly's death

28:10.479 --> 28:13.514
and Sarah refused to keep it
a secret any longer?

28:13.582 --> 28:17.152
- Dev, find out where Jen is.
- Courage to overcome

28:17.220 --> 28:19.453
her darker self.

28:19.520 --> 28:21.588
Maybe the phoenix represented

28:21.656 --> 28:24.424
- Sarah coming clean.
- And by tattooing

28:24.492 --> 28:27.461
over the old ink, it sent
a clear message to Jen.

28:27.528 --> 28:29.930
Thanks.

28:29.998 --> 28:33.200
Yeah, she's not at the office. You may
have spooked her when you went to visit.

28:33.268 --> 28:35.034
- Get over to her house.
- Yeah.

28:41.375 --> 28:44.844
The door's open.

28:49.716 --> 28:51.784
Jennifer?

28:51.852 --> 28:53.786
I'm gonna go this way.

28:53.854 --> 28:56.188
IIB!

29:03.430 --> 29:05.398
Toby!

29:11.504 --> 29:13.504
She's breathing.

29:26.036 --> 29:28.338
Do you have any idea
who hit you with this?

29:28.406 --> 29:31.508
I remember coming
into the kitchen for water.

29:31.576 --> 29:35.078
- Here, put this on your head.
- Okay, so why don't we start

29:35.146 --> 29:37.080
by talking about Kelly Lerman?

29:38.210 --> 29:42.485
Whatever secret you're keeping cost Sarah
her life, and nearly cost you yours.

29:44.421 --> 29:47.756
The four of us started
the grow-op together.

29:47.824 --> 29:50.692
Sarah and I, Kelly and Max.

29:50.760 --> 29:53.061
Teenagers' idea of
a good business venture.

29:53.130 --> 29:56.498
An electrical issue
caused the fire.

29:56.565 --> 29:58.466
Kelly was asleep inside.

29:58.534 --> 30:00.201
They didn't prosecute
you and Sarah?

30:00.269 --> 30:02.437
Max had already done
a stint in juvie.

30:02.505 --> 30:04.539
He was in love with Sarah.

30:04.607 --> 30:07.808
He took the fall even though it was
Sarah who screwed up the wiring.

30:07.876 --> 30:10.645
Sarah referred to herself
as "Kelly" in her other life,

30:10.712 --> 30:13.780
and she covered up her matching
tattoo with new ink.

30:13.848 --> 30:16.350
We got the tattoos as a way
of remembering Kelly.

30:16.417 --> 30:18.552
And as a promise
to keep it a secret?

30:18.620 --> 30:21.421
Do you really think this has
something to do with Sarah's murder?

30:22.957 --> 30:24.858
Do you recognize him?

30:24.925 --> 30:27.628
Did you hire him?

30:36.703 --> 30:39.838
Hire him? No. He followed
Sarah to my house.

30:39.906 --> 30:43.776
He knew about her life as "Kelly". He was
also asking around town about her tattoos.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.413
It's Dev.

30:48.481 --> 30:50.815
He says Max Howzer got out
of prison a month ago.

30:50.883 --> 30:54.419
You're saying that Max killed Sarah
and that he's trying to kill me?

30:54.487 --> 30:58.456
- We don't know anything yet.
- Sarah went to see Max about a year ago.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.991
- The same time the tattoos started.
- Yeah.

31:01.059 --> 31:04.595
I tried to warn her not to contact him,
that it would only stir up the past.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.164
A forensics team is on its way.

31:06.284 --> 31:08.599
We're gonna call an ambulance. You
gotta get yourself checked out.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.534
I have to go back
to the office.

31:10.602 --> 31:12.636
Alright, just make sure
you're around people.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.838
Let's go see Max.

31:18.742 --> 31:21.844
Maybe Max Howzer got out
and saw Johnny with Sarah,

31:21.912 --> 31:24.414
- and in a jealous rage he killed her.
- So he goes after Jen

31:24.481 --> 31:26.849
to punish them both?

31:26.917 --> 31:29.619
Dev, I need you to put
an APB out on a van.

31:29.687 --> 31:31.621
It reads "Byford's
Pest Control" on the side.

31:31.689 --> 31:34.523
Will do. Hey, uh,
Howzer's parole officer

31:34.591 --> 31:37.492
has his address listed as
a rooming house on Sherbourne.

31:37.560 --> 31:40.362
I'll send you the address. And
Klein's already secured a warrant.

31:40.430 --> 31:43.198
Thanks, Dev.
Howzer's in Toronto.

31:43.266 --> 31:45.234
Well, let's
welcome him to town.

32:00.582 --> 32:02.683
Hey, Michelle?

32:02.751 --> 32:04.618
- Come check this out.
- What?

32:05.886 --> 32:09.356
- Looks like a match.
- Whoa.

32:09.423 --> 32:13.360
I saw Sarah wearing that in a read.
That could be the murder weapon.

32:15.829 --> 32:18.498
- I'm gonna check out the other room.
- Yeah.

32:33.079 --> 32:35.414
Hey! Drop it!

32:35.482 --> 32:38.115
You're under arrest for
the murder of Sarah Wembley.

32:41.420 --> 32:44.000
- It's the murder weapon.
- I've never seen that before.

32:44.120 --> 32:46.991
Well, your prints were also found
on the bookend that struck Jennifer.

32:47.058 --> 32:50.027
I didn't kill Sarah,
I didn't attack Jen.

32:50.095 --> 32:52.462
- Then why'd you attack us?
- In prison,

32:52.530 --> 32:55.131
someone's in your cell
uninvited, you come in swinging.

32:55.199 --> 32:58.001
So it's just a coincidence

32:58.068 --> 33:00.771
that you show up in Toronto
and Sarah turns up dead?

33:00.838 --> 33:03.239
- A shame is what it is.
- You went to prison

33:03.308 --> 33:05.409
for a fire that she was
responsible for.

33:05.476 --> 33:07.678
- And?
- She was found strung up

33:07.745 --> 33:10.115
surrounded by a ring of flames.

33:10.235 --> 33:11.949
You know, neighbours from
your old grow-op,

33:12.069 --> 33:14.298
 they thought you guys
were into satanic worship.

33:14.418 --> 33:17.253
It's a small town.

33:17.321 --> 33:19.956
People overreact to black
clothes and heavy metal.

33:20.024 --> 33:22.325
Listen,

33:22.392 --> 33:25.360
I went down for Kelly's death.

33:25.428 --> 33:27.696
And yeah, Sarah screwed up
the wiring at the grow-op.

33:27.763 --> 33:29.965
But I cared about her,
she had a future.

33:30.033 --> 33:31.715
I didn't.

33:31.835 --> 33:34.040
She cut off all contact with you
when you were in prison, right?

33:34.160 --> 33:35.384
That must have upset you.

33:35.504 --> 33:38.040
Yeah, well, I made my choice,
and I did my time.

33:38.107 --> 33:41.775
Then she reached out to you. Maybe
that stirred up some old emotions.

33:49.958 --> 33:54.355
Sarah came to see you.
She showed you her tattoos.

33:54.422 --> 33:57.490
She said we could rise from our
ashes, just like her phoenix.

33:57.558 --> 34:00.160
She was trying to help me.

34:00.228 --> 34:02.462
Said maybe there was still
something between us.

34:02.529 --> 34:04.231
But then you found out
about Johnny.

34:04.298 --> 34:06.399
- Who?
- Johnny.

34:06.467 --> 34:09.435
Listen, man, I told her
it wouldn't work,

34:09.503 --> 34:12.505
that she was feeling guilty. She asked
me to come to Toronto when I got out.

34:12.572 --> 34:14.773
We found the murder weapon
in your room.

34:14.841 --> 34:17.141
You're the only who had motive
for both of the crimes.

34:17.210 --> 34:19.411
If you're not responsible,
how do you explain this?

34:19.478 --> 34:22.001
Someone's trying to frame me.

34:22.121 --> 34:23.716
That is not very original.

34:23.835 --> 34:26.199
Well, they'd have to know
a lot about your past.

34:26.319 --> 34:28.820
Jen and Sarah did a great job
of keeping that a secret.

34:28.888 --> 34:31.022
There was a guy.

34:31.090 --> 34:33.891
He followed Sarah to my rooming
house. She came to see me.

34:37.929 --> 34:40.297
Is this the guy?

34:40.366 --> 34:42.967
Yeah.

34:43.034 --> 34:45.034
Yeah, that's the guy.

34:45.103 --> 34:48.871
Murder weapon and motive. Looks
like Max is going back to prison.

34:48.940 --> 34:51.541
When we accused him of murder,
I got disbelief.

34:51.609 --> 34:54.911
We need to identify the stalker.
Dev, any luck with the APB?

34:54.978 --> 34:58.448
Yeah. Turns out there is
no Byford's Pest Control.

34:58.516 --> 35:01.671
The van's registered to a Ryan Turner.
He's a private investigator.

35:01.791 --> 35:05.111
Good work, Corporal.
Have forensics run Max's DNA

35:05.231 --> 35:08.757
and see if it matches the crime scene. In the
meantime, let's find out who hired Turner.

35:08.825 --> 35:11.360
You can ask him yourself.
We just brought him in.

35:13.230 --> 35:15.164
So why were you following
Sarah and Jennifer?

35:15.232 --> 35:16.823
I was putting together a file.

35:16.943 --> 35:17.757
For who?

35:17.877 --> 35:20.249
If I revealed my client list,
I wouldn't have one for long.

35:20.369 --> 35:23.010
I'm sure you're familiar with the
privilege my license gives me.

35:23.205 --> 35:26.441
Sarah Wembley was killed. Possibly
as a result of your investigation.

35:26.509 --> 35:29.477
That's unfortunate. But
I had nothing to do with it.

35:29.546 --> 35:31.446
Well, you're the only one
who might be able to help us

35:31.514 --> 35:34.114
identify her killer. So you're
gonna tell us what you know.

35:34.182 --> 35:36.083
Who hired you?

35:41.389 --> 35:45.059
Even if I wanted to, they paid
cash and didn't give me a name.

35:46.461 --> 35:49.563
Brent Sanders.

35:49.597 --> 35:52.198
- Jen could be with him now.
- Yeah.

35:59.669 --> 36:02.838
Well, if Brent dug up Sarah's
history a her life as "Kelly",

36:02.905 --> 36:06.308
- he could have framed Max.
- Turner gives him Max's address.

36:06.376 --> 36:09.811
Brent plants the necklace,
makes it look like revenge.

36:09.879 --> 36:13.185
Dev, did you contact Jen?

36:13.305 --> 36:15.283
<i>lt's after hours,
No one's answering at reception.</i>

36:15.351 --> 36:18.953
But I checked on Brent Sanders. That
guy's been to the Caymans five times

36:19.021 --> 36:22.657
<i>in the last year.</I>
Setting up accounts. Thanks, Dev.</i>

36:26.162 --> 36:29.830
A few more signatures and Largo
Markets will own Cloud 9 and you...

36:29.898 --> 36:33.133
will be a very wealthy woman.

36:33.201 --> 36:36.336
I, uh... just want to make
sure it's the right move.

36:36.404 --> 36:38.338
Of course.

36:38.406 --> 36:40.840
And I know these last few days
have been really hard.

36:40.908 --> 36:43.436
But trust me, this is your best
move, alright?

36:43.556 --> 36:44.470
Brent Sanders.

36:44.590 --> 36:46.879
- This is a private meeting.
- Not anymore.

36:46.946 --> 36:49.315
Why did you hire a private investigator
to look into your colleagues?

36:49.383 --> 36:51.350
- What?
- I can explain.

36:51.418 --> 36:54.019
So explain to us why
you hired Ryan Turner?

36:55.789 --> 36:57.590
Five million for me

36:57.658 --> 37:00.426
if I get the price down 15%.

37:00.494 --> 37:02.828
Largo Markets got Cloud 9

37:02.896 --> 37:05.230
at a discount. He was
gonna get a payoff.

37:05.298 --> 37:07.566
- That is ridiculous.
- We know about the off-shore accounts.

37:07.633 --> 37:09.634
Okay, I've had enough of this.
This is insulting.

37:09.703 --> 37:11.804
Sarah knew what
the company was worth.

37:11.871 --> 37:13.672
That's why she wasn't willing
to accept your appraisal.

37:13.740 --> 37:15.841
The number that you two fought
over, who gave it to you?

37:15.909 --> 37:18.276
- You did.
- Right. So Turner got back to you

37:18.344 --> 37:20.512
with stories about her past,
and the grow-op

37:20.580 --> 37:22.681
and you thought you could blackmail
her into selling the company.

37:22.748 --> 37:24.282
She wasn't gonna sell.

37:31.257 --> 37:34.226
You killed her?

37:34.293 --> 37:35.926
I did not kill her.

37:35.993 --> 37:38.629
- You tried to pin it on Max.
- Forensics is pretty amazing.

37:38.697 --> 37:40.931
A few flakes of skin
under her fingernails

37:40.998 --> 37:42.166
and it's all over for you.

37:42.286 --> 37:44.118
I imagine we'll find scratches
on your arms.

37:44.769 --> 37:47.338
You killed Sarah and
you tried to frame Max?

37:47.405 --> 37:51.007
- Jen, you can't possibly believe...
- Okay, okay.

37:51.075 --> 37:53.376
You're under arrest for
the murder of Sarah Wembley.

37:53.444 --> 37:56.546
It's okay.

38:04.154 --> 38:07.489
- I heard congratulations are in order.
- You heard correctly.

38:07.557 --> 38:09.991
I appreciate your efficiency.

38:10.059 --> 38:13.094
Even though it means
Johnny's bar will remain open?

38:13.162 --> 38:16.865
You got a killer
off the street, Alvin.

38:18.218 --> 38:21.936
And there are other ways
to satisfy the powers that be.

38:22.004 --> 38:24.972
Not to worry.

38:25.039 --> 38:27.508
I'll figure something out.

38:40.954 --> 38:43.690
Well, the news cycle gets
its ritualistic killer,

38:43.758 --> 38:47.026
- and a frame job to boot.
- And forensics found

38:47.094 --> 38:49.329
Sarah's DNA all over
the back of Brent's car.

38:49.397 --> 38:52.299
Largo Markets is under investigation
for corporate espionage,

38:52.366 --> 38:54.567
and Jennifer's gonna
keep the company.

38:54.635 --> 38:57.836
And her and Max Howzer
might work it out after all.

38:57.904 --> 39:00.639
I suppose it's never too late
to tell the truth.

39:00.707 --> 39:02.741
Alright.

39:10.883 --> 39:12.684
So she parked in my spot again.

39:12.751 --> 39:15.492
- What am I supposed to do?
- I think you gotta egg her car.

39:15.612 --> 39:17.322
Good idea.

39:17.389 --> 39:19.724
It's not bad.

39:19.792 --> 39:22.059
You okay?

39:22.127 --> 39:25.330
Yeah, I'm good. Just thinking
about this case we closed today.

39:25.397 --> 39:27.531
Is it true he already set up
accounts in the Caymans?

39:27.598 --> 39:29.666
Confidential.

39:29.734 --> 39:31.309
But true.

39:34.238 --> 39:37.040
Wow, are we telling secrets
tonight, Toby?

39:37.107 --> 39:40.043
Actually, yeah, we are.

39:40.110 --> 39:43.412
- Really?
- Yes. Um...

39:45.582 --> 39:47.516
Okay. Just
freaking me out a little.

39:47.584 --> 39:49.719
I've told you

39:49.786 --> 39:52.187
that I read faces.

39:52.255 --> 39:55.658
- Right.
- That is not true.

39:58.027 --> 40:01.796
Okay. So what do you do?

40:04.367 --> 40:07.635
I read people's minds.

40:07.703 --> 40:10.505
Their thoughts.

40:13.209 --> 40:15.510
I deliver baby elephants.

40:15.578 --> 40:17.745
Sometimes polar bears.

40:17.812 --> 40:20.481
I'm a midwife
for all species, really.

40:20.548 --> 40:23.484
That's fair. I know
it sounds crazy.

40:23.551 --> 40:27.454
Alright, look.
This couple,

40:27.522 --> 40:30.457
here, looks like
they're arguing?

40:30.525 --> 40:34.560
He's gonna get down
on his knees and propose.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.301
She's gonna say no.

40:41.369 --> 40:43.703
And walk out of here.

40:52.845 --> 40:54.813
Now's he's gonna call his friend

40:54.881 --> 40:57.082
to grab some drinks
to drown his sorrow.

41:04.190 --> 41:06.858
Okay. I get it.
You know them.

41:06.926 --> 41:08.960
Was that it?

41:09.028 --> 41:10.995
You had a heavy case and now you're trying
to lighten things up with a practical joke.

41:11.063 --> 41:12.898
- That's really funny.
- It's not a joke.

41:12.965 --> 41:15.667
It's who I am. It's what I do.

41:15.735 --> 41:18.970
But I've been afraid
to tell you because...

41:19.038 --> 41:21.204
it's ruined every
single relationship

41:21.272 --> 41:23.407
I've ever had.

41:30.381 --> 41:32.852
This woman, in the red.

41:34.252 --> 41:36.186
She wants her cheque.

41:39.323 --> 41:41.791
But she also wants dessert.

41:56.706 --> 41:59.808
You're saying
you can read my mind?

41:59.876 --> 42:02.344
I can't read yours.

42:02.411 --> 42:05.881
I don't know if that's because of
your epilepsy or the medication.

42:05.949 --> 42:08.416
I think that's why we work.

42:08.484 --> 42:11.051
Because I have no idea
what you're about to say or do

42:11.119 --> 42:13.888
and I love that.

42:18.594 --> 42:21.662
You gotta help me out.

42:21.730 --> 42:24.798
I have no idea
what you're thinking.

42:29.470 --> 42:31.972
Do you believe me?

42:36.878 --> 42:38.812
I don't know what to believe.

42:38.880 --> 42:41.013
I'm sorry.
