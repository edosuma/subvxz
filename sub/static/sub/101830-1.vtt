07:48.937 --> 07:51.773
No, no, no, no, no!

22:22.945 --> 22:24.379
Daddy!

23:29.810 --> 23:30.612
Hello?

23:33.170 --> 23:33.949
Hello?

23:36.952 --> 23:38.819
Are you all right?

23:38.853 --> 23:39.655
Are you hurt?

23:46.728 --> 23:47.562
Don't be scared,

23:49.665 --> 23:50.899
it's me remember?

23:54.670 --> 23:55.803
Are you cold?

23:55.836 --> 23:56.837
Oh no, no, no, no.

23:56.871 --> 23:57.872
It's okay.

23:58.806 --> 23:59.840
See?

24:03.045 --> 24:03.844
It's okay.

25:55.957 --> 25:57.592
You want some air?

26:54.683 --> 26:56.551
Can't you wait.

26:56.585 --> 26:57.887
All right, hold
still, hold still.

26:58.753 --> 27:00.555
Let me help you, here we go.

27:00.589 --> 27:02.691
Have this one.

27:02.724 --> 27:03.625
Oh, no, no.

27:03.658 --> 27:08.163
Okay, now.

27:23.411 --> 27:26.214
Your sister does not
get off until five.

27:26.248 --> 27:28.049
So that gives us the
whole day together.

27:29.919 --> 27:31.520
Ah, I have lots of ideas.

27:31.553 --> 27:34.055
They have boats
down at the park now

27:34.089 --> 27:37.859
and the ocean is getting
warm so we can see the beach

27:37.894 --> 27:39.728
or maybe the pier.

27:44.866 --> 27:46.701
Oh, remember the merry go round?

28:04.786 --> 28:08.925
I still have that picture of
you on the black stallion,

28:10.125 --> 28:13.161
smiling and riding in circles
on that merry go round.

28:41.323 --> 28:42.959
It's all up to you.

35:35.104 --> 35:36.438
No, no, no, no.

35:38.040 --> 35:40.442
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

37:37.559 --> 37:38.626
Martin and Associates.

37:40.329 --> 37:42.830
Yeah, actually my two
o'clock just opened up.

37:42.864 --> 37:44.133
Martin and Associates.

37:44.166 --> 37:45.766
I mean, you can talk to
Bob, but I definitely,

37:45.800 --> 37:47.136
I had a long discussion with him

37:47.169 --> 37:48.036
and I went over all of...

37:48.070 --> 37:49.138
Oh, I know.

37:49.905 --> 37:50.939
Martin and Associates.

37:50.973 --> 37:52.508
Just popped up on
a notification.

37:52.541 --> 37:54.276
I don't know, she called
me out of the blue.

37:54.309 --> 37:55.144
I think we scored her.

37:55.177 --> 37:56.378
Great.

37:56.411 --> 37:57.712
I'm sure it was your
drinks on Friday night.

37:58.514 --> 37:59.381
Martin and Associates.

37:59.414 --> 38:00.616
Great, so I'll move you to 2:30.

38:00.648 --> 38:01.884
I haven't had an entire
cup of coffee yet,

38:01.917 --> 38:02.985
you're asking way
too many questions.

38:03.018 --> 38:04.987
Susan today and then I
have an open meeting.

38:05.020 --> 38:08.023
So she's trying to
put it on a property

38:08.056 --> 38:09.857
that is essentially
worth nothing.

38:09.892 --> 38:11.393
It's gotta be two days earlier.

38:11.426 --> 38:12.693
For Friday.

38:12.727 --> 38:13.861
Exactly we have
to meet by Monday.

38:13.896 --> 38:15.898
Great, thank you.

38:34.516 --> 38:36.518
Martin and Associates.

38:39.955 --> 38:40.923
Vandalized?

38:42.558 --> 38:44.560
How? What happened?

38:54.970 --> 38:56.704
Actually don't call the police.

38:58.607 --> 38:59.942
I can be there in 15 minutes.

39:01.643 --> 39:02.411
Okay.

40:08.143 --> 40:09.344
I almost called the cops.

40:16.118 --> 40:17.119
Never do that again.

40:19.955 --> 40:21.923
You should have called me.

40:21.957 --> 40:23.592
You would have said no.

40:23.625 --> 40:24.459
Absolutely!

40:25.826 --> 40:28.397
Mom, you've made
so much progress.

40:30.299 --> 40:33.402
This is a trigger,

40:34.670 --> 40:37.906
any memory or memento,
it can cause a relapse

40:39.174 --> 40:40.742
and I don't wanna
come home to...

40:46.181 --> 40:50.419
When there is a
trigger, what do we do?

40:51.353 --> 40:52.220
We recognize it.

40:52.254 --> 40:53.821
We recognize it, that's right.

40:54.990 --> 40:55.724
And...

40:57.059 --> 40:58.060
We deny it.

40:58.093 --> 40:58.927
We deny its power,

41:01.096 --> 41:02.364
and we let it go.

41:03.231 --> 41:05.701
And we let it go.

41:05.734 --> 41:06.501
Because?

41:08.170 --> 41:10.172
Because when we
don't, we get hurt.

41:18.280 --> 41:20.415
I'll bring these
back when you're ready.

41:23.251 --> 41:24.686
But only when you're ready.

41:26.188 --> 41:27.889
I just wanted
to see him again.

41:38.467 --> 41:39.601
I wanna see him again.

42:07.996 --> 42:08.764
Mom.

42:12.501 --> 42:13.402
She's home.

42:15.270 --> 42:16.071
Mom.

42:17.572 --> 42:19.508
It's unlocked, again.

42:21.009 --> 42:22.978
Mom, I told you
when I'm not here,

42:23.011 --> 42:25.714
you have to lock up and
you have to set the alarm.

42:25.747 --> 42:27.482
Honey,

42:27.516 --> 42:29.351
honey, I am so glad you're home.

42:30.852 --> 42:33.155
There you are, okay, I have
a big surprise for you.

42:33.188 --> 42:35.290
Mom,
do you remember that we talked about you

42:35.323 --> 42:36.825
locking up the door
when I'm not here?

42:36.858 --> 42:37.894
Okay, yeah.

42:37.926 --> 42:39.161
And
setting the alarm?

42:39.194 --> 42:39.928
No,
it's totally fine.

42:39.961 --> 42:41.596
I just, I'm so excited,

42:41.630 --> 42:43.598
please go into the living
room and see what's there.

42:57.345 --> 42:58.613
Where
did you find him?

42:58.647 --> 42:59.981
He found
me, he came home.

43:00.015 --> 43:02.050
Because
somebody is going to charge

43:03.051 --> 43:04.686
you with kidnapping.

43:04.719 --> 43:05.987
Have you called the cops?

43:07.222 --> 43:08.156
Who is he?

43:08.190 --> 43:10.258
He's your brother.

43:10.292 --> 43:13.395
No,
Todd is dead, mom.

43:14.696 --> 43:16.097
He's dead.

43:16.131 --> 43:17.299
He's not coming back.

43:18.700 --> 43:20.502
You know what, I think
you went off your meds.

43:20.535 --> 43:22.971
I told the doctors that if
I was gonna supervise you,

43:23.004 --> 43:25.006
that you had to be on your meds.

43:25.040 --> 43:26.074
He will hear you.

43:31.580 --> 43:32.414
Who are you?

43:40.088 --> 43:41.056
Do you speak English?

43:43.658 --> 43:44.993
Can you hear me?

43:45.026 --> 43:46.328
It's okay, tell her.

43:47.162 --> 43:48.497
He doesn't understand, mom.

43:48.530 --> 43:50.031
Yes, he does, Todd tell her.

43:50.065 --> 43:52.033
He doesn't understand, mom.

43:52.067 --> 43:53.034
Yes, he does!

43:53.068 --> 43:54.836
Then why doesn't he talk?

43:54.870 --> 43:55.670
Talk!

43:58.406 --> 44:00.408
Wait, wait, wait, hey.

44:10.085 --> 44:10.887
Come back!

44:17.960 --> 44:18.760
Come back.

46:45.908 --> 46:48.643
Yes, he's a seven
year old, black and white cat,

46:48.677 --> 46:50.211
about nine and a half pounds.

46:51.579 --> 46:53.581
Well, the door was
open when I got home.

46:55.383 --> 46:56.184
No but,

46:59.187 --> 47:02.390
he's tried to get out before,
I thought I left it closed.

47:07.395 --> 47:08.763
Nothing else was stolen.

47:17.907 --> 47:21.043
There's no one else here who
would have seen anything.

50:22.557 --> 50:24.726
We can't keep opening
up these wounds.

50:32.902 --> 50:36.404
What you did, if
you do that again,

50:37.739 --> 50:39.241
you're gonna be in
serious trouble.

50:41.676 --> 50:42.443
Okay?

50:47.682 --> 50:49.084
It's probably really sick.

50:51.686 --> 50:52.487
I mean, you saw him.

50:55.490 --> 50:56.457
He could have hurt you.

50:58.127 --> 51:00.095
He could have done
something to you.

51:02.864 --> 51:03.698
Do you understand?

51:05.367 --> 51:08.003
What you did was so dangerous.

51:23.018 --> 51:23.818
Hello?

51:24.686 --> 51:26.956
No, yes we're okay.

51:28.157 --> 51:29.557
Thank you for calling back.

51:31.126 --> 51:32.194
No, she's fine too.

51:34.063 --> 51:36.698
No, he was just here
when I got home.

51:38.033 --> 51:39.667
Yeah, I was with
her this morning.

51:40.903 --> 51:41.703
Uh huh.

51:42.704 --> 51:43.504
Never.

51:46.141 --> 51:47.508
I have never seen this guy.

51:48.876 --> 51:51.013
I mean, and to be
completely honest with you,

51:52.714 --> 51:54.582
he looked exactly like him.

51:56.085 --> 51:56.885
Yeah.

52:18.873 --> 52:23.845
I know.

52:27.883 --> 52:28.683
Mom.

52:30.019 --> 52:31.253
I'm gonna call you back.

52:32.720 --> 52:33.521
Mom.

52:37.893 --> 52:38.693
Mom.

52:42.563 --> 52:43.298
Mom.

52:44.599 --> 52:45.401
Mom.

52:49.871 --> 52:50.638
Mom.

52:51.806 --> 52:53.108
Mom, are you okay?

52:54.476 --> 52:55.710
Mom, wake up.

52:55.743 --> 52:58.247
I don't understand.

52:58.280 --> 53:00.182
You're okay.

53:00.215 --> 53:02.418
You're okay, you're okay,
you're gonna be okay.

53:02.451 --> 53:03.718
It's just, odd.

53:03.751 --> 53:06.455
Wait,
just wait a second.

53:09.158 --> 53:11.927
Just gotta be calm.

53:11.960 --> 53:12.727
Mom.

58:55.937 --> 58:59.408
Hey, no, no, no, wait, oh.

59:01.743 --> 59:02.811
Just wait a second.

59:18.193 --> 59:19.261
Hey!

59:21.663 --> 59:23.031
I'm not going to hurt you.

59:24.499 --> 59:25.934
I just...

59:32.641 --> 59:37.646
I don't know who you are
or where you came from,

59:44.453 --> 59:45.954
but I need you to come back.

59:49.124 --> 59:49.991
She's sick,

59:51.126 --> 59:52.127
she's really sick.

59:54.296 --> 59:57.165
And the only thing that has
made it any better is you.

1:00:01.703 --> 1:00:05.140
So, if you could just...

1:00:16.518 --> 1:00:17.319
Excuse me.

1:00:29.164 --> 1:00:30.332
Excuse me.

1:00:36.104 --> 1:00:36.906
Please,

1:00:41.343 --> 1:00:44.212
if you just say something.

1:01:48.010 --> 1:01:49.244
Is that a yes?

1:02:52.173 --> 1:02:54.242
So I wasn't dreaming?

1:03:03.251 --> 1:03:06.521
I was afraid that I was asleep
and I just imagined you.

1:03:20.102 --> 1:03:21.770
Thank you for waking me.

1:04:00.442 --> 1:04:01.810
I wasn't there that day.

1:04:05.213 --> 1:04:06.715
He'd been sick for so long,

1:04:10.218 --> 1:04:12.587
I just had to move on.

1:04:14.789 --> 1:04:16.424
I couldn't be there every day.

1:04:21.296 --> 1:04:22.764
It was the doctor who called me

1:04:27.136 --> 1:04:28.570
and when I got to the hospital,

1:04:31.840 --> 1:04:35.310
she was on the floor crying.

1:04:41.016 --> 1:04:42.350
That's when I lost them both.

1:04:49.191 --> 1:04:50.625
I never got to say goodbye.

1:04:56.297 --> 1:04:58.366
Could only really
imagine saying goodbye.

1:05:12.447 --> 1:05:15.450
You pretended that
you were her son,

1:05:17.719 --> 1:05:18.620
do you think that,

1:05:21.322 --> 1:05:24.292
do you think that I could
pretend like you were my brother?

1:05:41.543 --> 1:05:43.212
I gave up too soon Todd,

1:05:46.314 --> 1:05:47.515
far too soon.

1:05:53.588 --> 1:05:55.224
I miss you every day,

1:06:02.231 --> 1:06:03.265
and I love you.

1:06:18.247 --> 1:06:19.048
Goodbye.

1:06:48.210 --> 1:06:49.245
Honey,

1:06:51.479 --> 1:06:52.447
sweetie.

1:07:00.388 --> 1:07:02.024
I'm sorry.

1:07:02.057 --> 1:07:03.292
You're my baby.

1:13:28.377 --> 1:13:31.613
Hey, look at you little guy.

1:13:33.181 --> 1:13:36.418
I have been looking
everywhere for you,

1:13:36.451 --> 1:13:37.452
come here.

1:13:40.855 --> 1:13:42.024
Did you have a big day?
