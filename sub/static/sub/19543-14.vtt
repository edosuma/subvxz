Vegeta had dispatched Nappa himself.

00:09.343 --> 00:13.882
In the face of such incomparable power,

00:13.972 --> 00:17.214
Goku finally risks using a technique

00:17.309 --> 00:20.893
that will push him beyond his limits.

Awesome, man...

03:25.455 --> 03:28.367
Why, you...!

03:50.772 --> 03:53.900
Y-You miserable...!

03:59.615 --> 04:04.359
H-He's got 'im! He just might win this!

05:00.342 --> 05:03.049
l-lmpossible! How can his...

05:03.136 --> 05:07.755
How can Kakarrot's battle
power be greater than mine?

05:13.814 --> 05:19.354
D-D-Damn, this guy is tough.
I have to settle this quick, or else...

05:21.613 --> 05:24.605
S-Shoot, my body...

05:24.700 --> 05:27.817
|-|'m not going to let this happen!

05:27.911 --> 05:29.947
I am a super-elite!

05:30.038 --> 05:35.283
There's no way I'll be beaten
by that lower-class warrior!

05:35.377 --> 05:39.666
I am the best in the universe!

05:39.756 --> 05:44.625
S-Sure enough, it looks like using a
triple Kaio-ken is too much for me.

05:44.720 --> 05:49.339
If this drags out too long,
I'm the one who will be done in first.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.222
Blood!

05:55.313 --> 05:59.773
My noble blood has been
spilled by that piece of trash?!

05:59.860 --> 06:08.325
l-l won't allow it! No way... No way will I allow it!

06:08.410 --> 06:11.026
Who needs this planet anymore?!

06:11.121 --> 06:16.081
I'm going to blow you and
all of Earth into tiny pieces!

06:17.753 --> 06:19.835
You're gonna what?!

06:23.300 --> 06:25.962
Go ahead and dodge this if you can!

06:26.053 --> 06:30.046
You might save yourself,
but Earth will be blown to pieces!

06:30.140 --> 06:32.677
Damn, he thought this through!

06:35.562 --> 06:37.848
I'll have to risk it!

06:44.404 --> 06:50.115
A triple-Kaio-ken...

06:50.202 --> 06:53.740
...Kamehame-ha!

06:53.830 --> 06:59.621
Ka... me...

06:59.711 --> 07:01.997
...ha...

07:02.089 --> 07:05.581
There's no way you can stop my Gyallic-Ho!

07:05.675 --> 07:09.293
......me

07:10.722 --> 07:15.591
I'll turn you and the whole Earth into space dust!

07:15.685 --> 07:21.021
...ha!!

07:28.698 --> 07:33.067
W-What?! It's just like my Gyallic-Ho!

07:44.714 --> 07:47.046
Kaio-ken...

07:47.134 --> 07:50.968
...times four!

07:58.145 --> 08:00.727
l-lt's pushing me back--

08:23.336 --> 08:28.956
H-H-He did it! He did it!

08:29.050 --> 08:34.340
Son! Ya did it, you magnificent bastard!

08:35.807 --> 08:38.514
Yajirobe? What are you doing here?

08:38.602 --> 08:41.217
What, you didn't notice?

08:41.313 --> 08:45.226
For as strong as even you are,
you sure did bust yer tail there, huh?

08:45.317 --> 08:50.107
--Yeah, I guess.
--But then, way to send that awesome dude flyin'!

08:50.197 --> 08:53.405
You sure are one helluva stud, there.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.279
W-What? What'sa matter?

09:00.373 --> 09:03.740
l-l used a technique that was
too much for my body to take.

09:03.835 --> 09:06.872
Oh, yeah? Well, it wasn't
nothin' normal, that's fer sure.

09:06.963 --> 09:11.332
Never mind me, Yajirobe,
you should get out of here.

09:11.426 --> 09:12.791
What for?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.376
Y-You don't mean...

09:14.471 --> 09:20.057
He's still alive. If that's all it
took to kill him, it'd be too easy.

09:20.143 --> 09:25.058
B-But it's no sweat, right?
You're the stronger one.

09:25.148 --> 09:28.732
I told you, | overdid it,
and now my body is falling apart.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.150
I might be just about maxed out.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.354
l-ls that right?

09:35.450 --> 09:37.111
Well, then...

09:37.202 --> 09:39.739
G-Good luck with that!

09:52.175 --> 09:56.760
D-Damn it!

09:56.846 --> 10:02.091
How?! How can Kakarrot's battle
power be greater than mine?!

10:02.185 --> 10:05.143
Damn it all! lam a Saiyan!

10:05.230 --> 10:08.893
lam the strongest one in the entire world!

10:13.822 --> 10:15.904
At this point, as much as I hate how ugly it is,

10:15.991 --> 10:17.527
it's time for my last resort--

10:17.617 --> 10:21.451
to transform into a Great Ape, and crush him!

10:21.538 --> 10:25.656
My strength as a Great Ape is overwhelming!

10:25.750 --> 10:28.537
Damn it, I chose to arrive here
on the day of the full moon

10:28.628 --> 10:31.791
so that we could wipe out the
people of this planet quickly,

10:31.881 --> 10:35.590
but I never thought I'd have to
transform just to defeat Kakarrot!

10:35.677 --> 10:38.089
This really burns me up!

10:42.225 --> 10:47.936
That's strange. It's well past time
that the moon should be visible.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.981
Saiyan, no matter how hard
you look, it won't do any good.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.443
The moon isn't there.

10:52.527 --> 10:55.769
That Piccolo fellow was afraid
something like this might happen,

10:55.864 --> 10:57.729
and got rid of it long ago.

10:57.824 --> 11:02.409
Still, Goku can't have very much strength left.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.362
Even if the Saiyan doesn't
transform into a Great Ape,

11:05.457 --> 11:07.618
it doesn't change the fact that he's in trouble.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.870
But then, he's growing weaker, too.

11:09.961 --> 11:13.328
The Genki Dama! If you can
hit him with a Genki Dama,

11:13.423 --> 11:16.335
you'll beat him for sure!

11:20.972 --> 11:24.430
That's weird. He's just hovering around up there.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.553
Why doesn't he come down after me?

11:26.644 --> 11:30.182
It's gone! It's gone! It's gone! Damn it!

11:30.273 --> 11:33.686
The moon isn't anywhere! How can this be?!

11:33.777 --> 11:38.316
| get it. Damn it! That bastard
is driving me right up the wall!

11:38.406 --> 11:41.569
Kakarrot took out the moon
before we even got started!

11:41.659 --> 11:42.819
Now I've got no choice.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.742
My battle power might drop a little bit,

11:44.829 --> 11:47.320
but it doesn't look like I've got any other option.

11:47.415 --> 11:51.829
Ha, I can't wait to see the
look of panic on his face!

12:08.478 --> 12:11.015
He's finally coming back down.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.526
The only way for me to beat
him is with a Genki Dama.

12:18.613 --> 12:21.525
Will I be able to focus enough?

12:21.616 --> 12:23.572
Kakarrot!

12:23.660 --> 12:26.527
You may have thought you were
clever, getting rid of the moon,

12:26.621 --> 12:28.236
but it's not going to work!

12:28.331 --> 12:31.744
The moon? What do you mean?

12:31.835 --> 12:33.871
And now you're playing dumb.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.453
Do you know why it is that
we are able to transform

12:36.548 --> 12:38.459
when we look at a full moon?

12:38.550 --> 12:39.960
Transform?

12:40.051 --> 12:43.669
The light of the moon is that
which is reflected from the sun.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.550
It is only when sunlight is
bounced back by the moon

12:46.641 --> 12:48.256
that it contains Bruits waves.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.558
When the moon is full,

12:50.645 --> 12:54.388
those Bruits waves exceed
a value of 17 million zenoes.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.939
What is this guy talking about?

12:57.026 --> 13:01.395
Once at least 17 million zenoes of
Bruits waves are absorbed by the eyes,

13:01.489 --> 13:03.901
the tail responds to it...

13:03.992 --> 13:06.028
...and the transformation begins!

13:06.119 --> 13:07.825
There are a limited number of Saiyans

13:07.912 --> 13:09.573
that can artificially create a full moon

13:09.664 --> 13:12.201
that produces more than 17 million zenoes.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.784
Your gambit won't play out!
Despite getting rid of the moon,

13:15.879 --> 13:20.589
when the oxygen of this planet
mixes with my Power Ball...

13:26.514 --> 13:28.220
Sorry to keep you waiting, Kakarrot.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.970
Your death is finally at hand!

13:31.060 --> 13:34.018
A lower-class warrior shouldn't have challenged

13:34.105 --> 13:36.847
a super-elite like me to battle, anyhow!

13:36.941 --> 13:40.809
The moment he produced that
strange light, his Ki dropped.

13:40.904 --> 13:44.271
What is he planning to do,
that he would go that far?

13:51.331 --> 13:53.572
What?!

14:01.966 --> 14:04.378
Burst open and intermix!

14:17.649 --> 14:20.265
W-What...

14:20.360 --> 14:23.147
...is that? What have you done?!

14:25.573 --> 14:28.360
Y-You don't mean...

14:28.451 --> 14:32.364
H-He created a moon!

14:37.460 --> 14:43.581
You're going to regret having
lost your tail, Kakarrot!

15:01.776 --> 15:04.313
'Ulp!

15:04.404 --> 15:06.565
Is this the end?

15:15.665 --> 15:17.872
W-What is that?

15:45.445 --> 15:48.937
H-Hey, over there...

15:51.409 --> 15:54.697
T-That's the direction we just came from.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.029
What could it be? It's awfully bright.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.994
T-This is impossible!

16:21.939 --> 16:24.772
W-What is that? There's a tremendous Ki rising.

16:24.859 --> 16:28.772
Father's Ki hasn't gone up again, has it?

16:28.863 --> 16:32.606
N-No, this icky feeling is from the other guy.

16:32.700 --> 16:36.443
And l have to say, his Ki is really something else.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.744
What's going on?

16:38.831 --> 16:41.413
F-Father...

16:46.255 --> 16:47.870
Gohan...

16:50.426 --> 16:54.419
l-l'm going back there.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.051
I'm going back.

16:57.141 --> 17:00.224
G-Going back? You mean, to where Goku is?

17:00.311 --> 17:04.474
l-l just know that Father is in danger,

17:04.565 --> 17:07.477
and he's going to die if I don't do something.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.310
What are you talking about, Gohan? Goku isn't--

17:10.405 --> 17:13.613
There's no way your father
is going to die, you know.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.567
For one thing, even if we do go back,

17:16.661 --> 17:18.151
against a guy with a Ki like that...

17:18.246 --> 17:21.454
Yes, I know...

17:21.540 --> 17:23.281
Still...

17:23.376 --> 17:27.164
l have to go! I'm sure of it!

17:27.255 --> 17:29.211
H-Hey!

17:29.298 --> 17:31.334
Wait up, Gohan!

17:48.151 --> 17:50.608
What do you say, Kakarrot?

17:50.695 --> 17:53.812
You're finished now!

17:57.285 --> 17:59.776
W-What is going on here?!

18:12.133 --> 18:16.046
A-A Great Ape? A Great Ape monster?!

18:21.726 --> 18:24.138
I'm going to let you in on a little something.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.719
The battle power of a Saiyan
in his Great Ape form

18:26.814 --> 18:30.727
is ten times greater than before!

18:34.739 --> 18:37.071
Goku, on the night of the full moon,

18:37.158 --> 18:41.652
a giant ape monster appears.
You must not go outside then.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.909
If you're asleep, you'll be safe.

18:44.999 --> 18:49.538
I will fix it so that your tail never grows back.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.666
It seems to be something of a nuisance, after all.

18:52.757 --> 18:57.467
So that's it. I finally understand.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.635
H-How can that be?

18:59.722 --> 19:02.885
The monster that stomped Grandpa to death...

19:02.975 --> 19:08.186
...and appeared at the tournament
grounds, smashing them up...

19:08.272 --> 19:11.685
...w-was me?

19:17.448 --> 19:19.154
Forgive me, Grandpa.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.528
This guy is ridiculously powerful.

19:21.619 --> 19:26.579
Unless I use up all of my Ki, I doubt
I have a chance of beating him.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.658
Once I die, and go back over to the Next World,

19:29.752 --> 19:31.583
I'll come and apologize to you.

19:36.050 --> 19:38.086
I'll show you, Vegeta!

19:38.177 --> 19:40.839
I'm gonna cram a Genki Dama
from me and the Earth

19:40.930 --> 19:43.842
right down your throat!

19:49.522 --> 19:51.934
F-Father!

19:53.693 --> 19:57.857
Goku... He's your son, all right.

20:24.682 --> 20:27.970
K-Kaio-ken!

20:36.986 --> 20:38.942
What's the matter?!

20:41.657 --> 20:45.900
Can't you even run away?

20:45.995 --> 20:49.112
Die!

20:53.252 --> 20:57.916
What's the matter, Kakarrot?
Can't you deal with this?

20:58.007 --> 21:01.420
A-As huge as he is, he's so fast!

21:01.510 --> 21:05.799
There ain't enough time for me
to focus to create a Genki Dama!

21:05.890 --> 21:09.758
Not even a times-five Kaio-ken
would work against him!

21:09.852 --> 21:12.264
Hmph, you're not going to come at me?

21:12.355 --> 21:15.768
In that case, I'll go after you!

21:15.858 --> 21:17.974
The situation is critical!

21:18.069 --> 21:20.731
While facing Vegeta, turned into a Great Ape,

21:20.821 --> 21:24.985
will you be able to create a Genki Dama, Goku?

21:25.076 --> 21:30.662
Rats, | only need ten seconds!
Give me enough time to focus!

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yaburekabure omoikiri
