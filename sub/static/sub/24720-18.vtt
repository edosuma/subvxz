00:40.990 --> 00:42.540
You’re interrupting
my preparations.

00:42.540 --> 00:44.410
WATSON: Too bad. The auditions
are about to start.

00:44.410 --> 00:46.990
You gotta get down here
before these symphony people

00:46.990 --> 00:49.000
find out I can’t play the tuba.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.120
Is our quarry there yet?

00:50.120 --> 00:51.990
I’m looking at Mr. Marinko
as we speak.

00:51.990 --> 00:53.990
Does he have
the stolen instrument with him?

00:53.990 --> 00:55.080
There’s a big lock on his case.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.540
It’s pretty weird
if he’s just got any old flute.

00:57.540 --> 00:58.990
But if we’re right
and he stole one

00:58.990 --> 01:00.990
that belonged to the greatest
flautist of all time...

01:00.990 --> 01:03.120
Oh, please.
Jean Pierre Rampal was, at best,

01:03.120 --> 01:05.990
the third greatest flautist
to ever purse his lips.

01:05.990 --> 01:07.290
(doorbell ringing)
WATSON: Whatever.

01:07.290 --> 01:09.000
I’m telling you,
we’ve got maybe an hour

01:09.000 --> 01:10.700
to steal this thing back
for our client

01:10.700 --> 01:13.250
before Marinko takes it home
to Slovenia.

01:13.250 --> 01:15.700
Fine. I’ll hurry.

01:16.370 --> 01:17.410
Hello.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.830
Uh, I’m David Horowitz.

01:18.830 --> 01:19.580
I’m sorry.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.990
I’m looking for Sherlock Holmes,

01:20.990 --> 01:22.080
the detective.
I also apologize.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.830
I don’t have time
to talk to you at the moment.

01:23.830 --> 01:26.160
Perhaps you could make
an appointment.
No, Mr. Holmes, please.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.410
I just need a minute.

01:27.410 --> 01:29.000
I think it might
be a matter

01:29.000 --> 01:30.290
of life and death.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.660
(sighs)

01:33.910 --> 01:36.620
Uh, a couple of months ago,

01:36.620 --> 01:39.330
my brother Norman
passed away.

01:39.330 --> 01:41.990
Um, they said it
was an overdose.

01:41.990 --> 01:43.410
You suspect foul play?

01:43.410 --> 01:46.370
No, no.
My brother was schizophrenic.

01:46.370 --> 01:47.620
He took a lot of pills.

01:47.620 --> 01:50.200
Not all of them
were prescribed by doctors.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.750
So many barbiturates
in his system,

01:51.750 --> 01:54.120
we think he probably
just mixed up his meds.

01:54.120 --> 01:58.120
No, I’m here because
of something Norman wrote

01:58.120 --> 01:59.500
before he died.

01:59.500 --> 02:00.950
Matter of life and death,
you said.

02:00.950 --> 02:04.990
Uh, about a year ago,
I-I helped him get a job.

02:04.990 --> 02:06.540
I thought it would
be good for him.

02:06.540 --> 02:11.370
He started writing obituaries
for a small local paper.

02:11.370 --> 02:12.410
He really liked it.

02:12.410 --> 02:16.410
In fact, he liked it so much,
he wrote a bunch of obituaries

02:16.410 --> 02:18.370
for people who hadn’t died yet.

02:18.370 --> 02:19.580
Well, that’s normal practice

02:19.580 --> 02:21.120
in the newspaper business,
isn’t it?

02:21.120 --> 02:22.990
So they’re ready
when the news breaks.

02:22.990 --> 02:25.040
Sure, they do it
for politicians, celebrities,

02:25.040 --> 02:27.120
but Norman did hundreds
of write-ups

02:27.120 --> 02:29.120
for, like, random citizens.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.910
People he didn’t know.

02:30.910 --> 02:32.990
And all these obits
included

02:32.990 --> 02:35.950
how and when they died.

02:36.500 --> 02:37.580
The paper sent them all back.

02:37.580 --> 02:40.040
Well, you did say
he was schizophrenic.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.120
Yeah.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.040
Norman was crazy.

02:43.040 --> 02:46.990
But not as crazy as this.

02:46.990 --> 02:48.990
In the time
since he died,

02:48.990 --> 02:52.990
Norman’s predictions
have gone three for three.

02:53.040 --> 02:56.120
He’s been right
about everything: the dates...

02:56.750 --> 02:58.160
...the causes of death.

03:01.990 --> 03:04.700
While I’m sure there’s a mundane
explanation for all of this,

03:04.700 --> 03:06.410
I confess to not seeing it yet.

03:06.410 --> 03:08.000
That being said,

03:08.000 --> 03:09.870
you’ve come to the right place.

03:09.870 --> 03:11.330
I’ll take your case.

03:11.330 --> 03:12.410
Oh.

03:12.410 --> 03:13.950
Uh, no, I’m sorry.

03:13.950 --> 03:16.410
I didn’t come to hire you.

03:16.410 --> 03:17.990
I came to warn you.

03:17.990 --> 03:21.450
My brother predicted
your death, too.

03:21.990 --> 03:23.620
If he’s right again,

03:23.620 --> 03:27.500
you’re gonna be killed
three days from now.

03:36.790 --> 03:38.990
Uh, is it okay

03:38.990 --> 03:39.990
HOLMES:
Finally.

03:39.990 --> 03:42.620
There you are.
There you are.
You never showed.

03:42.620 --> 03:43.790
I had to grab this on my own.

03:43.790 --> 03:46.250
Two ladies with bassoons
tried to take my head off.
I’m sorry.

03:46.250 --> 03:47.950
There’s no time for you
to regale us, Watson.

03:47.950 --> 03:50.120
According to Mr. Horowitz’s
late brother, I am to be

03:50.120 --> 03:52.990
gunned down in the
street on Friday.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.660
I’m so sorry
about all of this.

03:55.660 --> 03:58.200
There’s no need for
apologies, Mrs. Horowitz.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.950
I’m not yet resigned
to the fate

03:59.950 --> 04:01.410
that your
brother-in-law foresaw.

04:01.410 --> 04:04.160
I’m sorry.
I’m a little behind.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.870
David’s brother was
an obituary writer.

04:07.870 --> 04:08.990
He was a schizophrenic,

04:08.990 --> 04:11.790
and he made all sorts
of uncanny predictions

04:11.790 --> 04:14.450
about the deaths of strangers,
including mine.

04:14.450 --> 04:16.990
Tell me more about Norman.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.750
He was always brilliant.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.500
Ever since we were kids.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.500
He wrote a sci-fi novel
in college.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.990
There were publishers
interested.

04:24.990 --> 04:26.700
But then...

04:26.700 --> 04:28.790
he started hearing voices.

04:29.580 --> 04:30.870
Luz was really great.

04:30.870 --> 04:31.990
Insisted we take him in.

04:31.990 --> 04:34.950
Helped him turn the basement
into a little apartment.

04:34.950 --> 04:37.870
So you had intimate knowledge
of his comings and goings.

04:37.870 --> 04:38.990
Did he get out much?

04:38.990 --> 04:40.870
Oh, sure. He was
pretty outgoing

04:40.870 --> 04:42.620
for someone with
his disease.

04:42.620 --> 04:43.620
Why do you ask?

04:43.620 --> 04:45.830
I’m hoping for a
small social circle.

04:45.830 --> 04:48.990
Most likely, that’s
our pool of suspects.

04:48.990 --> 04:50.000
You agree with David.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.990
You think someone is
trying to make Norman

04:51.990 --> 04:53.200
look like some
sort of prophet.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.450
It’s the only possibility.

04:54.450 --> 04:56.990
Your brother-in-law
could not see the future.

04:56.990 --> 05:00.830
Someoneis killing the people
whose deaths he predicted.

05:00.830 --> 05:02.540
When I found those last week,

05:02.540 --> 05:04.250
the first two deaths
had already happened.

05:04.250 --> 05:08.990
I figured maybe it was
just a crazy coincidence.

05:08.990 --> 05:12.620
But then, when this woman jumped
off a building yesterday,

05:12.620 --> 05:14.790
just the way he
said she would,

05:14.790 --> 05:15.540
I thought I should find

05:15.540 --> 05:18.990
the next person he
said was gonna die.

05:18.990 --> 05:19.660
(sighs)

05:19.660 --> 05:22.250
I only wish I’d
warned her, too.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.660
You did the right thing
calling us.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.580
I think there’s something
you should see.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.990
Sorry for the mess.

05:32.990 --> 05:35.990
We just started
going through it all.

05:35.990 --> 05:39.990
Norman’s room was always
as cluttered as his mind.

05:39.990 --> 05:41.990
Looks like your brother
subscribed to every

05:41.990 --> 05:44.330
science and technology
journal out there.

05:44.330 --> 05:45.580
LUZ:
That was his thing.

05:45.580 --> 05:47.660
He was always reading,
coming up with

05:47.660 --> 05:49.950
weird theories
to explain his disease.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.540
Well, that’s fairly typical.

05:51.540 --> 05:53.500
In the 1950s,
many schizophrenics

05:53.500 --> 05:56.120
thought the Soviets
were controlling their mind

05:56.120 --> 05:56.990
via radio waves.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.990
In the ’90s,
it was popular to blame aliens

05:59.990 --> 06:02.080
because the search
for extraterrestrial life

06:02.080 --> 06:04.990
had become a popular subject.

06:04.990 --> 06:05.990
Yeah.

06:05.990 --> 06:10.160
For Norman, it was all
explained by Simulation Theory.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.580
I could be wrong,
but I-I think

06:11.580 --> 06:13.540
that’s what this
is all about.

06:13.990 --> 06:14.990
I’ve heard about that.

06:14.990 --> 06:16.160
God is a computer programmer
or something?

06:16.160 --> 06:18.990
None of us is real.
None of this is real.

06:18.990 --> 06:22.080
We’re all just strings
of ones and zeros

06:22.080 --> 06:24.990
on the hard drive
of some superior intelligence.

06:24.990 --> 06:27.660
He would talk about
how we went fromPong

06:27.660 --> 06:29.990
to 3-D video games
in just 40 years.

06:29.990 --> 06:33.870
If the trend holds, he’d say,
it’s only a matter of time

06:33.870 --> 06:35.370
before we can’t tell
the difference

06:35.370 --> 06:38.620
between reality
and virtual reality.

06:38.620 --> 06:40.660
Norman thought most
of us were just

06:40.660 --> 06:42.990
background characters
in a video game.

06:42.990 --> 06:43.990
"Most of us"?

06:43.990 --> 06:47.410
DAVID:
Well, not every character
in a video game

06:47.410 --> 06:48.330
is the same, right?

06:48.330 --> 06:50.410
Some are just extras,
they’re fillers,

06:50.410 --> 06:52.450
but some have powers.

06:52.450 --> 06:54.660
Norman thought
he was special,

06:54.660 --> 06:57.950
like all these prophets
before him.

06:57.950 --> 07:00.620
Nostradamus, Rasputin,

07:00.620 --> 07:01.950
Norman Horowitz.

07:01.950 --> 07:02.990
DAVID:
Yeah, they were all

07:02.990 --> 07:05.410
programmed differently
than people like you and me.

07:05.410 --> 07:07.910
They could see flashes
of the future.

07:07.910 --> 07:09.910
I told him it was crazy,
but, you know,

07:09.910 --> 07:11.990
not an effective
argument with him.

07:11.990 --> 07:13.580
The whole thing is absurd.

07:13.580 --> 07:14.830
HOLMES: Well, in
my experience,

07:14.830 --> 07:16.950
the more absurd a belief,
the more dangerous

07:16.950 --> 07:18.290
its adherents tend to be.

07:18.290 --> 07:21.410
Norman would go
to these, um...

07:21.410 --> 07:23.990
Oh. Simulation Symposiums.

07:23.990 --> 07:27.250
He met other people who liked
to think about this stuff.

07:27.250 --> 07:29.660
He talked to them online,
went to meet-ups.

07:29.660 --> 07:31.950
We were happy
he had friends.

07:31.950 --> 07:35.830
He was excited his theories
about prophets and schizophrenia

07:35.830 --> 07:37.160
were catching on
with some of them.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.990
Perhaps one of them killed
three innocent people

07:39.990 --> 07:42.540
to stir up interest
in their theory.

07:42.540 --> 07:43.580
I couldn’t tell you who.

07:43.580 --> 07:45.910
Norman knew we thought
it was all nonsense.

07:45.910 --> 07:48.370
He never introduced us
to his buddies.

07:48.370 --> 07:49.950
WATSON:
This is weird.

07:49.950 --> 07:50.990
Looks like your brother
kept a copy

07:50.990 --> 07:53.700
of correspondence
with one of our old clients.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.910
Apparently another fan
of Simulation Theory.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.660
Would that be a certain
billionaire that we saved

07:59.660 --> 08:01.620
from a robotic
hellhound?

08:06.910 --> 08:09.120
Oh, you two look great.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.500
Thanks for seeing us,
Mr. Baskerville.

08:11.500 --> 08:12.910
Oh, please,
call me Henry.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.660
I’m still alive
because of you guys.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.990
So, to what do I
owe the pleasure?

08:16.990 --> 08:17.990
Multiple homicides.

08:17.990 --> 08:19.160
I know you’re
a busy man.

08:19.160 --> 08:22.040
You’ve got patents to poach
and a tech empire to run.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.290
So I’ll be direct.

08:23.290 --> 08:25.660
What can you tell us
about your relationship

08:25.660 --> 08:28.830
with a man
named Norman Horowitz?

08:28.830 --> 08:29.870
This is someone I know?

08:29.870 --> 08:31.080
We found letters
he wrote you.

08:31.080 --> 08:34.200
And you responded to one,
thanking him for his kind words

08:34.200 --> 08:36.200
about a talk you gave.

08:39.870 --> 08:41.000
Oh, yeah. That guy.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.909
He cornered me at an event
that we sponsor.

08:43.809 --> 08:46.400
To be honest, I think
he might be a little nuts.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.080
Well, he was schizophrenic.
He passed away.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.100
Before he died,

08:49.100 --> 08:51.520
he foretold a number
of untimely deaths,

08:51.520 --> 08:53.770
and his predictions
keep coming true.

08:53.770 --> 08:55.060
Norman was obsessed

08:55.060 --> 08:55.980
with Simulation Theory.

08:55.980 --> 08:58.560
He thought it explained
psychic phenomena.

08:58.560 --> 08:59.890
We think somebody’s
killing people,

08:59.890 --> 09:03.150
carrying out a hoax,
to prove that he was right.

09:04.100 --> 09:05.060
We think that the killer

09:05.060 --> 09:06.350
also believes
in Simulation Theory,

09:06.350 --> 09:07.980
and since you’re so plugged
into that world,

09:07.980 --> 09:11.520
we think you can understand
why we’d ask for your help.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.350
Well, actually,
I don’t think I do.

09:13.350 --> 09:15.270
I mean, Simulation Theory
isn’t just

09:15.270 --> 09:16.940
some fringe thing
for fanatics and cranks.

09:17.940 --> 09:19.060
It’s probably
the most logical

09:19.060 --> 09:20.980
explanation for existence
ever devised.

09:20.980 --> 09:23.000
There’s Nobel winners
who believe in this.

09:23.050 --> 09:24.590
And at least one murderer.

09:24.590 --> 09:26.170
We think we’re looking
for someone

09:26.170 --> 09:28.210
that Norman shared
his predictions with,

09:28.210 --> 09:30.630
and that person
is now violently committed

09:30.630 --> 09:32.750
to changing
the fundamental paradigm

09:32.750 --> 09:34.840
through which existence
is understood.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.290
What do you mean?

09:36.290 --> 09:38.590
Many people have been murdered
in God’s name,

09:38.590 --> 09:39.750
but this wouldn’t be

09:39.750 --> 09:41.130
the first time that an atheist

09:41.130 --> 09:43.290
has killed to undermine
religious faith.

09:44.290 --> 09:45.000
Our killer is a zealot,

09:45.000 --> 09:46.670
but just not the kind
we’re used to.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.340
Well, if you’re right,
their plot’s

09:48.340 --> 09:49.340
gonna backfire
big-time.

09:49.340 --> 09:52.130
Simulation Theory will take
a hit if they get exposed.

09:52.130 --> 09:53.210
If they get exposed.

09:53.210 --> 09:54.750
I imagine they plan to succeed.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.420
And their chances
will certainly improve

09:56.420 --> 09:57.710
if the next name on the list

09:57.710 --> 09:59.750
gets crossed off,
’cause it’s mine.

09:59.750 --> 10:02.800
He wrote your obituary, too?

10:03.210 --> 10:04.710
Did you know him?
No.

10:04.710 --> 10:06.500
He may have gotten my name
from the phone book.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.170
But it’s more likely
that he came across my name

10:09.170 --> 10:10.420
when he was reading up on you.

10:10.420 --> 10:12.130
There was a
lot of press

10:12.130 --> 10:13.590
about the work we did for you.

10:13.590 --> 10:15.880
Look, obviously,
I want to be helpful.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.500
And a lot of crazy people

10:17.500 --> 10:20.380
go to these Simulation
Symposiums, unfortunately.

10:20.380 --> 10:24.170
Would it help if I gave you
a list of their names?

10:24.670 --> 10:25.920
Thanks, Greg.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.460
This is kind of
our no-fly list.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.920
People who got a
little too aggressive

10:28.920 --> 10:30.550
trying to sell me their
ideas over the years,

10:30.550 --> 10:32.500
an ex or two who engaged
in some light stalking.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.960
It’s pretty much anyone
and everyone

10:33.960 --> 10:35.920
that my security is
supposed to watch out for.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.750
Including the strange people
you met at the Symposiums.

10:37.750 --> 10:40.130
Mm-hmm.
HOLMES: Are those
individuals clearly marked?

10:40.130 --> 10:42.000
Yeah, I hate to say,
there’s quite a few,

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
but you’ll see
who’s who in the notes.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.630
Is there anything
else I can do?

10:45.630 --> 10:46.960
No, this is great.
Thanks.

10:46.960 --> 10:49.800
Uh, before you go,
can I ask you one question?

10:49.800 --> 10:51.090
Do you know for sure

10:51.090 --> 10:53.250
that those three people
were murdered?

10:53.250 --> 10:54.170
The alternative is that

10:54.170 --> 10:56.290
Norman Horowitz
could see the future.

10:56.290 --> 10:59.290
Yeah, it is.

11:00.250 --> 11:02.290
Will you let me know
what you find?

11:07.380 --> 11:08.420
So, if you have a moment,

11:08.420 --> 11:10.300
there’s a plan
I’d like to discuss.

11:10.300 --> 11:12.290
Actually, I’m a
little ahead of you.

11:12.290 --> 11:13.420
I think you
should lie low.

11:13.420 --> 11:16.210
Stay here and go over the list
that Baskerville gave us.

11:16.210 --> 11:17.170
I looped Marcus in.

11:17.170 --> 11:18.750
He and I are gonna look
into one of these deaths.

11:18.750 --> 11:21.630
I think, if we solve one of
them, we’ll solve them all.

11:21.630 --> 11:23.130
That’s a reasonable
assumption

11:23.130 --> 11:24.840
and an acceptable
division of labor,

11:24.840 --> 11:26.420
but it’s not what I meant.

11:26.420 --> 11:29.840
We need to talk about
what happens after I die.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.800
"The Last Will and Testament
of Sherlock Holmes"?

11:32.800 --> 11:36.130
According to Mr. Horowitz,
in three days’ time,

11:36.130 --> 11:40.250
I am to be riddled with bullets
by an unknown assailant

11:40.250 --> 11:41.670
in an unnamed part
of the city.

11:41.670 --> 11:43.090
While I doubt
that will happen,

11:43.090 --> 11:45.250
reading it did remind me
that you should have a copy

11:45.250 --> 11:48.250
of the appropriate paperwork
to ensure a smooth probate.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.550
You didn’t write
all this up today.

11:50.550 --> 11:52.670
No, I wrote it several years ago

11:52.670 --> 11:54.380
when we formalized
our partnership.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.170
I just didn’t give you a copy.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.170
Am I reading this right?

12:01.170 --> 12:02.750
You left me everything?

12:02.750 --> 12:04.750
You’re surprised?

12:04.750 --> 12:06.880
Uh...

12:06.880 --> 12:10.090
I guess I’m touched.

12:10.090 --> 12:11.960
There are some directives
in the back

12:11.960 --> 12:13.420
that you should review.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.420
Instructions on what to do
with your cerebellum?

12:19.420 --> 12:21.130
Mmm. Also my bees.

12:21.130 --> 12:22.670
They will need a proper home.

12:22.670 --> 12:26.460
Uh, it says here that I’m
supposed to sell the brownstone

12:26.460 --> 12:28.210
if I can’t pay the taxes

12:28.210 --> 12:29.290
on your foreign equities.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.050
This is a very valuable home.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.590
What kind of taxes
are we talking about?

12:32.590 --> 12:34.340
When I came of age,
my father bequeathed me

12:34.340 --> 12:36.250
some stocks
which are traded on the Nikkei.

12:36.250 --> 12:37.840
The holdings were quite
substantial then.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.090
I suspect they still are.

12:39.090 --> 12:41.290
You suspect? Okay,
I don’t mean to be crass,

12:41.290 --> 12:43.300
but if you are murdered,
how many reasons

12:43.300 --> 12:45.130
will the police have
to suspect me?

12:45.130 --> 12:47.460
Feel free to check the balance
on my brokerage account.

12:47.460 --> 12:50.290
The log-in should be
in the appendix.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.460
As for the threats
that Baskerville identified,

13:00.460 --> 13:04.380
I suppose I should prioritize
the most recent incidents.

13:08.290 --> 13:12.250
Um, I think there’s a problem.

13:16.290 --> 13:17.710
Did you type
everything correctly?

13:17.710 --> 13:18.750
Yeah. There’s your name.

13:18.750 --> 13:20.250
This is definitely
your account.

13:20.250 --> 13:22.710
Then I’ve been robbed.

13:23.960 --> 13:24.800
How offensive.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.590
You don’t seem that surprised.

13:26.590 --> 13:29.210
No. I have an idea who did this.

13:29.210 --> 13:30.290
(cell phone chimes)

13:30.290 --> 13:32.500
Oh, it’s Marcus.
He’s ready to meet up.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.300
I should go.

13:33.300 --> 13:35.290
Did you decide
which murder to solve?

13:35.290 --> 13:36.590
Christina Dawson.
She’s the woman

13:36.590 --> 13:38.800
who supposedly jumped
off her own roof.

13:38.800 --> 13:42.210
It’s the most violent
and the most recent.

13:46.340 --> 13:48.090
I should have
offered you something.

13:48.090 --> 13:49.000
Do you need
a drink or...

13:49.000 --> 13:52.920
No, no. We appreciate you
taking the time to talk to us.

13:52.920 --> 13:54.340
It’s no problem.

13:54.340 --> 13:55.670
I was just...

13:55.670 --> 13:58.290
planning Christina’s funeral.

13:58.290 --> 13:59.840
The cops who came out yesterday,

13:59.840 --> 14:02.500
they put down that your wife
didn’t leave a note.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.500
No. Believe me,
I’ve been looking for one.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.290
Something to explain this.

14:07.290 --> 14:08.290
It makes no sense.

14:08.290 --> 14:10.000
It sounds like
you have doubts

14:10.000 --> 14:11.290
about what happened.

14:11.290 --> 14:13.090
I don’t know. I...

14:13.090 --> 14:15.710
I never thought
she would hurt herself.

14:16.380 --> 14:18.250
But that ledge
up there on the roof, it’s tall,

14:18.250 --> 14:22.290
and I don’t know why she’d go
up there in the first place.

14:22.750 --> 14:24.750
I can’t see how this
was an accident.

14:24.750 --> 14:27.630
Well, the file here
says you were out of town

14:27.630 --> 14:28.750
on a business trip.

14:28.750 --> 14:29.750
Can you think of anyone

14:29.750 --> 14:33.090
Christina had plans to see
the night she died?

14:33.090 --> 14:34.290
Why?

14:34.630 --> 14:36.290
Do you think that...

14:36.290 --> 14:38.290
Did those other cops
miss something?

14:38.290 --> 14:41.590
Maybe not, but we want
to take another look.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.130
There’s a coincidence

14:43.130 --> 14:44.590
we can’t really explain.

14:44.590 --> 14:47.300
A few months ago,
a disturbed man

14:47.300 --> 14:48.550
wrote some obituaries,

14:48.550 --> 14:51.340
predicting some people
would die on certain days.

14:51.340 --> 14:53.460
BELL:
He’s not a suspect.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.050
He died a couple months ago.

14:55.050 --> 14:56.290
His name was Norman Horowitz.

14:56.290 --> 14:59.670
Did you or your wife
happen to know him?

14:59.670 --> 15:01.290
No, I...

15:01.290 --> 15:04.050
I-I don’t think so.

15:04.050 --> 15:06.670
Are you saying he knew
Christina was gonna die?

15:06.670 --> 15:08.420
WATSON:
He predicted
that she would

15:08.420 --> 15:11.960
take her own life
on the day that she did.

15:12.290 --> 15:14.500
It’s possible
that someone else

15:14.500 --> 15:17.500
is making those
predictions come true.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.750
I don’t understand.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.630
Do you think she was pushed?

15:22.630 --> 15:24.420
BELL: We don’t know
what to think yet.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.090
We’re just trying to get
to the bottom of it.

15:26.090 --> 15:28.750
Would it be possible for you
to take us to the roof

15:28.750 --> 15:30.840
so we can take a look around?

15:34.500 --> 15:35.800
These are the keys,

15:35.800 --> 15:37.420
but, uh, I’m sorry.

15:37.420 --> 15:39.290
I can’t go up there.

15:40.170 --> 15:42.630
Not ever again.

15:51.290 --> 15:56.840
The file says she went
over the side right over there.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.590
We should watch
where we’re walking.

16:00.590 --> 16:01.710
We’re leaving tracks.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.290
It’s kind of hard not to.
There’s soot everywhere.

16:04.290 --> 16:06.300
We should get CSU up here
to take pictures.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.210
Yeah, we’re a day
late on that.

16:08.210 --> 16:09.960
Looks like they
did a square dance

16:09.960 --> 16:11.290
all over the crime scene.

16:11.290 --> 16:13.050
Assuming this is
a crime scene.

16:13.050 --> 16:14.710
Well, MLI and
first responders

16:14.710 --> 16:16.290
obviously
did not think so.

16:16.290 --> 16:19.130
Do we know what kind
of shoes she was wearing?

16:19.130 --> 16:21.750
Uh, she was dressed
for a night out.

16:21.750 --> 16:25.840
Had on, like, wedges,
I guess you’d call them.

16:25.840 --> 16:28.290
Okay, so...

16:28.290 --> 16:29.500
these are hers.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.800
And then one of these
other sets of prints

16:31.800 --> 16:33.500
has gotta be our killer’s.

16:33.500 --> 16:36.090
BELL: I’ll find out
who worked the scene yesterday,

16:36.090 --> 16:37.880
ask them what shoes
they were wearing

16:37.880 --> 16:40.090
so we can eliminate them.

16:41.090 --> 16:42.420
Actually, that might
not be necessary.

16:42.420 --> 16:44.170
Check out that lounge
area over there.

16:44.170 --> 16:47.290
Looks like a community space,
not just one person’s patio.

16:47.290 --> 16:48.290
The building looks new.

16:48.290 --> 16:51.420
I mean, they might have
security cameras up there.

16:51.420 --> 16:52.960
If they do, one of them

16:52.960 --> 16:56.550
might have caught
the murder on tape.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.050
HOLMES:
At the top here,

16:58.050 --> 16:59.130
this is the edge
she went over?

16:59.130 --> 17:01.710
Yeah. This is the angle
from the building next door.

17:01.710 --> 17:03.300
Whatever happened
should be on here.

17:03.300 --> 17:04.800
Any luck, we’ll
get a good look

17:04.800 --> 17:07.290
at the person’s face who
wanted the world to think

17:07.290 --> 17:08.339
that Norman Horowitz
was clairvoyant.

17:08.339 --> 17:09.839
Whoever it is,
I doubt they’ll be

17:09.839 --> 17:12.460
a match for anyone on
Baskerville’s list of suspects.

17:12.460 --> 17:13.960
You didn’t like
any of them?

17:13.960 --> 17:15.750
None seemed capable
of serial murder.

17:15.750 --> 17:18.550
Serial onanism,
on the other hand...

17:20.089 --> 17:21.290
There.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.750
There she is.

17:24.089 --> 17:26.670
I don’t see anyone
up there with her. You?

17:26.670 --> 17:28.420
WATSON:
Give it a second.

17:28.420 --> 17:30.170
If she knew the killer,
then he might have

17:30.170 --> 17:32.290
told her to meet him
on the roof.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.800
She really jumped.

17:46.290 --> 17:49.090
Okay, if no one else
is gonna say it, I will.

17:49.090 --> 17:52.250
Norman Horowitz
could see the future.

17:57.890 --> 18:00.190
♪ ♪

18:13.810 --> 18:14.810
You didn’t sleep.

18:14.810 --> 18:16.890
I’m scheduled to be
gunned down tomorrow.

18:16.890 --> 18:18.100
I thought solving this case

18:18.100 --> 18:19.770
would be a better use
of my time.

18:19.770 --> 18:21.520
And it would have been,
had I managed to do so.

18:21.520 --> 18:25.480
Still no idea how to explain
Christina Dawson jumping?

18:25.480 --> 18:27.440
My favorite theory
involves a sonic cannon.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.810
The killer could have
purloined one

18:29.810 --> 18:31.650
from the DARPA warehouse
in New Jersey,

18:31.650 --> 18:32.890
and with certain
modifications...

18:32.890 --> 18:33.890
Okay, let’s stop
right there.

18:33.890 --> 18:35.520
If a sonic cannon is
on your short list,

18:35.520 --> 18:37.230
then I think it’d just
be easier to admit

18:37.230 --> 18:38.890
that we’re living in
a computer simulation

18:38.890 --> 18:40.980
and that Norman Horowitz
could see the future.

18:40.980 --> 18:42.890
I confess, it’s
not yet clear

18:42.890 --> 18:46.020
how to apply Occam’s razor
to this case.

18:46.020 --> 18:47.190
Neither of
the other two deaths

18:47.190 --> 18:48.850
that Norman predicted
have offered

18:48.850 --> 18:50.890
any helpful handholds.
I looked.

18:50.890 --> 18:52.520
So nothing on Kamal Mehta,

18:52.520 --> 18:54.850
the guy who supposedly died
of bone cancer?

18:54.850 --> 18:57.150
In a hospice facility
with no security cameras.

18:57.150 --> 18:59.270
Obviously,
there wasn’t an autopsy.

18:59.270 --> 19:02.980
What about Patrick Chen,
car crash guy?

19:02.980 --> 19:04.890
How many ways
might one orchestrate

19:04.890 --> 19:06.520
a single-vehicle car crash?

19:06.520 --> 19:09.020
The car was scrapped,
so we’ll never know.

19:09.020 --> 19:12.060
(cell phone ringing)

19:12.980 --> 19:15.890
Mr. Horowitz, we were just
discussing your case.

19:15.890 --> 19:17.520
DAVID:
I’m sorry to call so early.

19:17.520 --> 19:18.600
I just... I need to know--

19:18.600 --> 19:21.690
did you talk to a reporter
about my brother?

19:21.690 --> 19:22.850
No, of course not. Why?

19:22.850 --> 19:25.890
Because I’ve got six news vans
parked in front of my house.

19:25.890 --> 19:29.560
Everyone wants to know
about Norman.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.890
REPORTER: Friends say
the troubled obituary writer

19:33.890 --> 19:35.730
claimed the visions came to him

19:35.730 --> 19:37.440
because of how
he was programmed.

19:37.440 --> 19:38.940
They say Horowitz himself
grappled

19:38.940 --> 19:40.650
for an understanding
of his gift

19:40.650 --> 19:43.060
and thought something
called Simulation Theory

19:43.060 --> 19:44.150
might hold the key.

19:44.150 --> 19:45.890
It’s remarkable--
every television journalist

19:45.890 --> 19:49.350
applies an identical patina
of smarm, no matter the story.

19:49.350 --> 19:52.270
I’ll give this woman one thing--
she’s got great sources.

19:52.270 --> 19:53.480
Check it out.

19:53.480 --> 19:55.810
They published a bunch of obits

19:55.810 --> 19:57.440
that Norman Horowitz wrote
so that viewers

19:57.440 --> 19:59.230
can check if they’re
next on the list.

19:59.230 --> 20:00.730
It’s a Channel 10
exclusive.

20:00.730 --> 20:02.890
There must not be
a single moral human

20:02.890 --> 20:03.890
at that television station.

20:03.890 --> 20:06.440
Surely they must suspect
that they’re promoting a killer

20:06.440 --> 20:07.650
and promulgating his beliefs.

20:07.650 --> 20:08.810
Yeah, and getting
a zillion clicks.

20:08.810 --> 20:10.890
I don’t recognize half
the names on this list.

20:10.890 --> 20:12.890
That’s because you’ve never
seen them before.

20:12.890 --> 20:14.100
Neither of us has.

20:14.100 --> 20:15.890
David didn’t
provide them,

20:15.890 --> 20:16.890
and those obituaries

20:16.890 --> 20:18.100
were not in Norman’s room.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.900
Then he must have
handed some of them

20:19.900 --> 20:21.730
to a friend
before he died.

20:21.730 --> 20:22.890
"Friend" and "coconspirator"

20:22.890 --> 20:25.770
are interchangeable
in this case, I think.

20:25.770 --> 20:27.400
You look pleased.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.060
Well, I’m mostly disgusted.

20:29.060 --> 20:29.980
But there’s
every chance

20:29.980 --> 20:33.810
that whoever leaked
this information is our killer.

20:35.020 --> 20:36.810
HOLMES:
Ms. Garrisi.

20:36.810 --> 20:38.600
Just the person
I came to see.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.520
Uh, Sherlock Holmes.

20:39.520 --> 20:42.520
I’m executive producer,
BBC World News America.

20:42.520 --> 20:43.480
A pleasure.

20:43.480 --> 20:44.350
How can I help you?

20:44.350 --> 20:47.810
Uh, could we
speak in private?

20:52.690 --> 20:54.060
HOLMES:
Thank you.

20:54.060 --> 20:55.440
Thank you so much.

20:55.440 --> 20:56.150
(chuckles)

20:56.150 --> 20:59.310
Can I first just say
how much I love your show?

20:59.310 --> 21:00.440
And I admire your work.

21:00.440 --> 21:01.770
That’s why I’m here.

21:01.770 --> 21:02.810
I saw the piece
that you did

21:02.810 --> 21:04.890
on the prophet character,
Norman Horowitz.

21:04.890 --> 21:06.230
Oh, that’s great.

21:06.230 --> 21:07.600
We’re proud of that one.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.020
You should be. Incredible get.

21:09.020 --> 21:10.230
How did you come by it?

21:10.230 --> 21:12.690
I mean, who sent you
all those obituaries?

21:12.690 --> 21:15.560
You know I can’t
reveal a source.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.600
Even to your new employer?

21:17.940 --> 21:19.560
We’re always looking
for fresh talent.

21:19.560 --> 21:23.890
You seem like you’re ready for
a move up to the big leagues.

21:24.520 --> 21:25.890
I’ve just got to know,

21:25.890 --> 21:27.980
how did you break that story?

21:28.730 --> 21:30.940
You’re not from the BBC.
I’m not?

21:30.940 --> 21:33.020
I’ve been working in this
dump for eight years,

21:33.020 --> 21:34.900
and I can’t even get
on the anchor desk.

21:34.900 --> 21:37.230
The BBC is about nine
rungs up the ladder.

21:37.230 --> 21:39.560
You’re either trying
to sleep with me or...

21:39.560 --> 21:40.650
I work with the NYPD.

21:40.650 --> 21:42.020
You’re in a position
to aid our investigation.

21:42.020 --> 21:44.890
By scrapping the Fourth
Amendment and burning my source?

21:44.890 --> 21:46.890
No, thanks.
I have to get back to work.

21:46.890 --> 21:48.190
I’ll make you a real offer.

21:48.190 --> 21:49.890
You must suspect
the truth.

21:49.890 --> 21:51.520
Someone’s killing people
in order to make

21:51.520 --> 21:54.060
Horowitz’s predictions
come true.

21:54.890 --> 21:55.980
He wanted an audience,

21:55.980 --> 21:57.150
and you gave him one.

21:57.150 --> 22:00.190
I thought you were gonna
make me an offer,

22:00.190 --> 22:01.310
not try to
guilt-trip me.

22:01.310 --> 22:02.650
Tell me who sent you
the obituaries,

22:02.650 --> 22:03.810
and I’ll be your next source.

22:03.810 --> 22:05.350
We’re gonna find
this person--

22:05.350 --> 22:07.310
a serial killer, mind you--
and when we do,

22:07.310 --> 22:08.400
that story can either go to you,

22:08.400 --> 22:10.560
or it can go
to your competition.

22:12.350 --> 22:13.480
Sherlock says this reporter

22:13.480 --> 22:15.890
got the tip from an
anonymous caller.

22:15.890 --> 22:17.600
Blocked number?

22:17.600 --> 22:19.890
Burner. Guy disguised
his voice, too.

22:19.890 --> 22:22.190
Told her where to find
the obits online.

22:22.190 --> 22:23.230
Didn’t give a name.

22:23.230 --> 22:26.480
So, all of these obituaries
Mr. Horowitz wrote,

22:26.480 --> 22:28.770
they were already floating
around on the Internet?

22:28.770 --> 22:32.730
More like they were buried
in a private chat room.

22:32.730 --> 22:35.690
RealityIsnt.net.

22:35.690 --> 22:36.890
"Dot net"?

22:36.890 --> 22:38.560
Haven’t heard that
in a few years.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.060
It’s not a real hangout
for the cool kids.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.890
I registered an account
so I could take a look.

22:43.890 --> 22:45.980
There’s 40 members,
mostly anonymous.

22:45.980 --> 22:47.560
They’re Simulation
Theory believers

22:47.560 --> 22:50.690
who like to speculate about
whether the universe is real.

22:50.690 --> 22:54.230
Couple days ago,
a new user joined--

22:54.230 --> 22:55.020
"WokeBaeBae."

22:55.020 --> 22:56.890
First and only post
they ever made

22:56.890 --> 22:59.150
was to upload all
of Norman Horowitz’s

22:59.150 --> 23:00.940
predictions
about who was gonna die.

23:00.940 --> 23:02.060
They didn’t get
any response.

23:02.060 --> 23:05.770
Nobody paid any attention
until Channel 10 got the tip.

23:05.770 --> 23:07.890
Sounds like whoever
posted this stuff

23:07.890 --> 23:08.900
decided to up the ante

23:08.900 --> 23:11.650
and make sure
that the news spread.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.690
Any chatter on the site
about who did this?

23:14.690 --> 23:15.730
Nobody knows.

23:15.730 --> 23:17.900
They’re all guessing,
pointing fingers.

23:17.900 --> 23:18.940
Who runs the site?

23:18.940 --> 23:22.650
They gotta have the IP addresses
of all the users.

23:22.650 --> 23:24.730
I’m checking the
URL registry,

23:24.730 --> 23:26.940
trying to I.D.
the board’s moderator,

23:26.940 --> 23:27.890
"Commander Deez."

23:27.890 --> 23:29.890
That guy is on the top
of my list.

23:29.890 --> 23:32.980
He’s made 15,000
posts ranting about

23:32.980 --> 23:33.900
Simulation Theory.

23:33.900 --> 23:35.600
I’m wondering if he got tired

23:35.600 --> 23:37.690
of preaching
to his echo chamber.

23:37.690 --> 23:39.810
Maybe he decided
to take his message

23:39.810 --> 23:41.810
to a wider audience.

23:43.270 --> 23:44.040
HOLMES (calling):
Watson?

23:44.440 --> 23:46.650
Yeah, I’m here.

23:51.060 --> 23:52.100
We’ve talked about this.

23:52.100 --> 23:53.850
You know I loathe
orange highlighters.

23:53.850 --> 23:55.390
So do I.
Everyone does.

23:55.390 --> 23:57.390
It’s extra motivation
to solve this

23:57.390 --> 23:58.520
so we can pull it all down

23:58.520 --> 24:00.900
before you’re shot to
death by some lunatic.

24:00.900 --> 24:03.390
So, you said Marcus
was gonna hunt down

24:03.390 --> 24:04.150
the message board moderator.

24:04.150 --> 24:05.390
I thought we’d get
there faster

24:05.390 --> 24:06.350
by searching the Internet

24:06.350 --> 24:07.850
for other sites
with accounts

24:07.850 --> 24:09.100
with the same
username.

24:09.100 --> 24:11.650
Turns out there are hundreds
of WokeBaeBaes out there,

24:11.650 --> 24:12.730
all posting up a storm.

24:12.730 --> 24:14.390
"The best lack all conviction,

24:14.390 --> 24:17.390
while the worst are full
of passionate intensity."

24:17.390 --> 24:19.440
And Yeats never even
saw the Internet.

24:19.440 --> 24:22.390
I know it’s a slog,
but maybe we find our killer

24:22.390 --> 24:26.390
because he always uses
the same handle and semantics.

24:26.390 --> 24:28.270
I mean, could be
that one of these

24:28.270 --> 24:29.150
other BaeBaes
is our guy

24:29.150 --> 24:31.980
and some review he wrote
about a corndog stand

24:31.980 --> 24:34.020
will give him away.

24:34.020 --> 24:36.390
(doorbell rings)

24:37.850 --> 24:38.980
Hello?
It’s him.

24:38.980 --> 24:40.150
Mr. Holmes, would you like me

24:40.150 --> 24:43.350
to secure the premises
before we deliver?

24:43.350 --> 24:44.600
No. Deliver what?

24:44.600 --> 24:46.730
Not real smart,
you ask me.

24:46.730 --> 24:49.770
Keeping all this
in a private home.

24:49.770 --> 24:51.850
I hope you know
what you’re doing.

24:51.850 --> 24:52.730
Sign here.

24:52.730 --> 24:55.520
Is that gold in
these boxes?

24:55.520 --> 24:57.520
Be back in a sec

24:57.520 --> 24:58.600
with the rest.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.310
There’s more?

25:01.440 --> 25:02.690
There’s a lot more.

25:02.690 --> 25:05.390
Well, I found the money
that was stolen from me.

25:05.390 --> 25:06.270
Well, that much I figured.

25:06.270 --> 25:09.400
I never did trust
my father’s estate attorney.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.390
He’s not the kind of man
who can be trusted.

25:11.390 --> 25:12.600
Which, ironically,
is a job requirement

25:12.600 --> 25:14.980
when representing Morland
Holmes’s legal interests.

25:14.980 --> 25:16.150
So, your father’s lawyer

25:16.150 --> 25:17.770
embezzled everything
in your trust?

25:17.770 --> 25:18.690
He claims he didn’t,

25:18.690 --> 25:20.390
although he did confess
to moving everything

25:20.390 --> 25:21.850
into vice stocks
without my permission.

25:21.850 --> 25:23.350
My inheritance
was supporting

25:23.350 --> 25:26.520
all kinds of immoral
corporate slime.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.270
Naturally, it grew
substantially,

25:28.270 --> 25:31.390
though I suspect he was
skimming off most of the gains.

25:31.810 --> 25:33.770
So you called him on it,
and then he was like,

25:33.770 --> 25:35.690
"Gee, I’m sorry, I’ll
just send you some gold"?

25:35.690 --> 25:38.900
He evinced a great affinity
for his lower extremities

25:38.900 --> 25:40.940
when I suggested
they might be at risk.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.850
He promised I would
be made whole within 12 hours.

25:43.850 --> 25:45.390
I doubted he would
be able to move

25:45.390 --> 25:47.350
such a large amount
of cash so quickly,

25:47.350 --> 25:49.230
but I see he was
well motivated.

25:49.230 --> 25:51.190
(door opens and closes)

25:51.190 --> 25:51.980
Oh.

25:51.980 --> 25:54.310
Got a lot of
gold there, huh?

25:54.310 --> 25:55.980
Henry. How unexpected.

25:55.980 --> 25:57.350
Uh, please.

25:57.350 --> 25:57.900
Oh.

25:57.900 --> 26:00.270
Yeah, sorry to, uh,
intrude. I just...

26:00.270 --> 26:01.730
I had an update.
Oh, great.

26:01.730 --> 26:03.390
Yeah, some guy called me
a couple hours ago.

26:03.390 --> 26:04.980
Really weird. Like,
changed his voice to sound

26:04.980 --> 26:07.560
like, you know, Darth Vader
or something, and he told me

26:07.560 --> 26:08.390
to put on Channel 10

26:08.390 --> 26:09.560
’cause they had a report.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.850
We saw it. Did he call
your cell phone?

26:11.850 --> 26:12.600
Uh, yeah, he did.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.900
Um, that’s his number
on the top right there.

26:14.900 --> 26:17.310
It’s the same caller who leaked
the story to the reporter.

26:17.310 --> 26:19.770
No doubt he’s hoping
you’ll help boost his message,

26:19.770 --> 26:21.390
drum up more interest
in Norman Horowitz

26:21.390 --> 26:23.520
amongst Simulation Theorists.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.350
I do hope you
won’t oblige.

26:25.350 --> 26:26.100
Wait a minute.

26:26.100 --> 26:27.390
Is that Christina Dawson,

26:27.390 --> 26:29.390
the woman who died
the other night?

26:29.390 --> 26:30.390
She’s alone,
isn’t she?

26:30.390 --> 26:32.390
Sorry. You should
not have seen that.

26:32.390 --> 26:36.650
Yeah, okay,
but she did jump, didn’t she?

26:37.900 --> 26:40.350
Norman Horowitz saw the future.
No, he did not.

26:40.350 --> 26:42.400
There will be a
logical explanation.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.650
The realm of what is possible
is not infinite.

26:44.650 --> 26:46.310
Oh, okay, well,
I agree with you there,

26:46.310 --> 26:47.850
but do you think
that you’re arguing against

26:47.850 --> 26:49.390
Simulation Theory or for it?
(cell phone chiming)

26:49.390 --> 26:52.150
It’s Marcus. He’s got
the name of the owner

26:52.150 --> 26:54.440
of that message board--
Terry Weaver.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.390
Wait, I know that name.

26:55.390 --> 26:57.980
That was on the list
that I gave you, I’m sure.

26:57.980 --> 26:59.100
He was also on a second list.

26:59.100 --> 27:00.650
Terry Weaver is one
of the subjects

27:00.650 --> 27:02.310
of Norman Horowitz’s
obituaries.

27:02.310 --> 27:03.390
Mr. Weaver is to be abducted

27:03.390 --> 27:05.690
and tortured to death
in about three weeks time.

27:05.690 --> 27:09.900
I think the NYPD is gonna want
to talk to him before then.

27:09.900 --> 27:12.190
(knocking)
BELL: Mr. Weaver, open up!

27:12.190 --> 27:15.770
We know you’re home.
We saw the curtains move.

27:15.770 --> 27:18.150
Might have to come
back with a warrant.

27:18.150 --> 27:20.560
Come on! We just
want to talk!

27:20.560 --> 27:21.390
(clattering)

27:21.390 --> 27:23.060
(someone groaning
and gagging inside)

27:23.060 --> 27:25.390
We have to take the door-- now.

27:27.650 --> 27:28.480
Damn it.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.390
Who’s got a knife?

27:30.390 --> 27:31.940
Don’t kick.

27:31.940 --> 27:33.480
Hey, hey, hurry up!

27:33.480 --> 27:35.390
We gotta cut him down.

27:35.390 --> 27:36.480
What’s going on, man?

27:36.480 --> 27:38.390
What was that about?
I’m gonna die.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.150
Sure, if you
hang yourself.

27:40.150 --> 27:42.520
I was just trying to take
the easy way out, okay?

27:42.520 --> 27:44.230
20 more seconds,
it would have worked.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.230
If you hadn’t come in here...

27:45.230 --> 27:47.390
Hey, hey, if you’re
asking me to apologize...

27:47.390 --> 27:49.190
No, I’m... I’m not.

27:49.190 --> 27:51.190
We’re both just
playing our roles.

27:51.190 --> 27:53.390
It’s all part
of the grand design.

27:53.390 --> 27:55.390
What are you talking about?

27:55.390 --> 27:57.020
I shouldn’t have bothered.

27:57.020 --> 27:58.650
Norman knew.

27:58.650 --> 28:01.310
Norman knew everything.

28:01.850 --> 28:05.100
Today wasn’t my day to die.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.390
It hurts to talk.

28:09.390 --> 28:10.690
Why won’t you all
leave me alone?

28:10.690 --> 28:13.390
Because I feel little sympathy
for you, Mr. Weaver.

28:13.390 --> 28:14.390
More suspicion.

28:14.890 --> 28:16.060
Didn’t you tell them
what happened?

28:16.060 --> 28:17.730
We know you tried
to hang yourself.

28:17.730 --> 28:19.690
What we don’t know is
whether you did it

28:19.690 --> 28:21.020
because you feared
Norman’s prediction

28:21.020 --> 28:22.980
about you being tortured
would come true

28:22.980 --> 28:24.190
or because you
heard the police

28:24.190 --> 28:26.890
banging on your door and
you knew it was over.

28:26.890 --> 28:28.100
What was over?

28:28.100 --> 28:29.890
HOLMES: The hoax
you’re perpetrating.

28:29.890 --> 28:32.020
I think you and Norman
hatched a plan.

28:32.020 --> 28:33.650
Between his
passing and yours,

28:33.650 --> 28:35.440
you would leave a string
of inexplicable deaths,

28:35.440 --> 28:37.650
all in accordance
with his prophecies.

28:37.650 --> 28:39.520
BELL:
Great way to recruit
for your cause, right?

28:39.520 --> 28:41.440
Draw more folks to
Simulation Theory?

28:41.440 --> 28:42.980
That’s crazy.

28:42.980 --> 28:43.890
I agree.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.890
But "crazy" seems to be
your whole purview.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.890
You have written
endless screeds online

28:47.890 --> 28:49.980
against religion,
social structure,

28:49.980 --> 28:51.400
against latex paint.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.690
Would it be worth it
to kill a few people

28:53.690 --> 28:56.890
if it would make a few
million question their faith?

28:56.890 --> 28:58.060
Of course not.

28:58.060 --> 28:58.940
I’m a pacifist.

28:58.940 --> 29:01.560
I don’t even play violent
video games, because...

29:01.560 --> 29:04.060
well, that’s... that’s exactly

29:04.060 --> 29:06.560
what I’m afraid
they’re doing

29:06.560 --> 29:07.890
to us.

29:07.890 --> 29:08.600
Who?

29:08.600 --> 29:10.190
Whoever is running
this simulation

29:10.190 --> 29:11.350
we’re all in.

29:11.350 --> 29:12.730
You and I, we’re just

29:12.730 --> 29:15.190
entertainment to them.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.690
My favorite video game is golf.

29:18.690 --> 29:19.890
I play it all the time.

29:19.890 --> 29:21.560
My friends and I,
we stream our sessions.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.890
If you think the three people
who died were killed,

29:23.890 --> 29:26.890
I’ll bet there’s video out there
that’ll alibi me

29:26.890 --> 29:28.100
for at least one
of their deaths.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.100
Let’s say you’re
telling the truth.

29:30.100 --> 29:31.150
Keep going.

29:31.150 --> 29:32.890
Tell us who did it.

29:33.400 --> 29:35.310
You own the site where
the obituaries were uploaded.

29:35.310 --> 29:37.900
It should be a simple matter
to see who posted them.

29:37.900 --> 29:39.980
I tried, okay?
The account was new.

29:39.980 --> 29:42.940
WokeBaeBae? They used a VPN
to mask their IP.

29:42.940 --> 29:45.940
I swear, I don’t know
any more about it than you.

29:45.940 --> 29:49.690
Well, you know more Simulation
Theorists than we do,

29:49.690 --> 29:50.060
so tell us--

29:50.060 --> 29:52.980
which one of them do you
think is capable of this?

29:52.980 --> 29:54.060
None of them.

29:54.060 --> 29:55.980
They’re my friends.

29:55.980 --> 29:56.890
But look, if...

29:56.890 --> 29:57.890
if Norman did set this up,

29:57.890 --> 29:59.020
maybe it was with his editor.

29:59.020 --> 30:01.520
At the newspaper
where he worked?

30:01.520 --> 30:02.230
No. I asked.

30:02.230 --> 30:04.520
He said it was a friend.
He wouldn’t tell me who.

30:04.520 --> 30:08.310
All I know is Norman
was working on his masterpiece.

30:08.310 --> 30:10.310
A big book
of predictions.

30:10.310 --> 30:11.100
He called itVisions.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.940
He would talk about it,
but he wouldn’t

30:12.940 --> 30:13.890
let anyone read it.

30:13.890 --> 30:17.060
One time, though,
he let me sneak a peek at it

30:17.060 --> 30:17.980
just for a second.

30:17.980 --> 30:20.890
It was handwritten
on black paper in white ink.

30:20.890 --> 30:21.810
It looked awesome.

30:21.810 --> 30:23.890
But he wouldn’t let
anyone read it.

30:23.890 --> 30:28.850
He said his editor wanted him
to keep it all hush-hush.

30:28.850 --> 30:30.440
This guy was helping him
polish it

30:30.440 --> 30:31.560
and then get it published.

30:31.560 --> 30:32.850
Norman said the guy didn’t want

30:32.850 --> 30:35.600
anyone seeing it
till they were ready.

30:35.890 --> 30:39.400
I don’t know,
maybe all this is happening now

30:39.400 --> 30:42.020
because they finally were ready.

30:46.890 --> 30:49.020
Guess I’ll check
the video golf alibi,

30:49.020 --> 30:51.690
but do we really think
that guy’s a killer?

30:51.690 --> 30:52.730
I suspect he’s not,

30:52.730 --> 30:54.310
but that book he mentioned
is intriguing.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.650
Yeah, that mystery editor
sounds exactly like

30:56.650 --> 30:59.190
the kind of paranoid wack job
we’re looking for.

30:59.190 --> 31:00.730
Assuming he’s real
and not just

31:00.730 --> 31:02.150
a voice in Norman’s
head, that is.

31:02.150 --> 31:03.730
David and his wife
might have some idea

31:03.730 --> 31:05.900
if he was working with someone.
I’ll go see them.

31:05.900 --> 31:08.020
You should go home
with a police escort.

31:08.020 --> 31:09.100
What?
She’s right.

31:09.100 --> 31:11.020
Nobody’s saying
Norman really

31:11.020 --> 31:12.980
was programmed to
see the future,

31:12.980 --> 31:13.940
but until we find out

31:13.940 --> 31:15.890
whoever’s killing
people on his list,

31:15.890 --> 31:19.230
today’s a bad day for you
to be on the street.

31:19.230 --> 31:20.690
Fine.
It’ll give me a chance

31:20.690 --> 31:24.810
to attend to that pile of gold
we left in the kitchen.

31:26.810 --> 31:27.940
I’m still not
seeing anything

31:27.940 --> 31:29.810
that looks like
a manuscript.

31:29.810 --> 31:30.440
Me, neither.

31:30.440 --> 31:31.690
I promise
I’ll stop asking,

31:31.690 --> 31:33.730
but are you sure you
can trust this Terry person?

31:33.730 --> 31:35.690
I keep thinking,
if Norman wrote a book,

31:35.690 --> 31:36.890
he would have told us.

31:36.890 --> 31:38.270
Maybe, maybe not.

31:38.270 --> 31:39.890
(sighs)

31:45.150 --> 31:46.890
DAVID:
I should have
thought of that.

31:46.890 --> 31:48.230
Norman was always
telling us

31:48.230 --> 31:49.310
to shred our bills.

31:49.310 --> 31:51.890
He worried about identity theft.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.650
Black paper, white ink.

31:54.650 --> 31:56.270
Looks like he
worried about people

31:56.270 --> 31:57.310
reading his book, too.

31:57.310 --> 31:58.600
I’m sorry.
No, no, no.

31:58.600 --> 31:59.900
It’s okay. I mean, it might not

31:59.900 --> 32:02.150
look like much,
but it could give us

32:02.150 --> 32:04.850
an idea
who he was working with.

32:07.350 --> 32:09.350
(heavy sigh)

32:09.350 --> 32:12.770
(quiet, jazzy music
playing over phone)

32:12.770 --> 32:14.020
20 minutes
I’ve been waiting.

32:14.020 --> 32:16.400
It’s impossible to get
anyone on the phone

32:16.400 --> 32:17.440
at the Federal Reserve.

32:17.440 --> 32:20.520
I don’t know why converting
bullion to usable currency

32:20.520 --> 32:22.520
has to be so difficult.

32:22.520 --> 32:24.100
You know, I think
Rumpelstiltskin

32:24.100 --> 32:25.890
used to say the
same thing.

32:25.890 --> 32:27.440
Mock me all you want.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.480
I’m doing this
for your golden years.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.900
I thought I got it a
lot sooner than that.

32:31.900 --> 32:34.520
You’re due on a
slab in the morgue

32:34.520 --> 32:35.810
in the next three hours

32:35.810 --> 32:37.310
if Norman Horowitz
was right.

32:37.310 --> 32:39.810
Well, heaven forbid
I draw my last breath

32:39.810 --> 32:41.650
listening to Muzak.

32:41.940 --> 32:44.980
I think this is gonna
make you feel better.

32:44.980 --> 32:46.560
Did Norman list
his murderous editor

32:46.560 --> 32:48.890
in the acknowledgements?
No.

32:48.890 --> 32:51.600
This is a page from Chapter One.

32:51.600 --> 32:52.980
Or at least it used to be.

32:52.980 --> 32:54.150
The left side is jagged.

32:54.150 --> 32:55.400
I think he ripped
out the page

32:55.400 --> 32:57.310
because the Chicago Cubs
did not repeat.

32:57.310 --> 33:00.560
In fact, none of the predictions
on this page came true.

33:00.560 --> 33:02.020
Well, that’s great.
(cell phone ringing)

33:02.020 --> 33:04.770
But it doesn’t get us
any closer to identifying

33:04.770 --> 33:07.890
his murderous,
book-editing accomplice.

33:07.890 --> 33:08.770
Marcus.

33:08.770 --> 33:10.520
Hey, thought you and Joan
would want to know,

33:10.520 --> 33:12.060
somebody just pulled
a fire alarm

33:12.060 --> 33:13.270
at Grand Central Station.

33:13.270 --> 33:15.440
Caused a panic.
Everybody ran out of there.

33:15.440 --> 33:17.520
And you thought we’d want
to know this because?

33:17.520 --> 33:19.730
Guy who did it,
his name’s Greg Haden.

33:19.730 --> 33:21.730
He says his boss
put him up to it.

33:21.730 --> 33:25.270
He works for your buddy,
Henry Baskerville.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.310
My lawyers don’t want me
to talk to you,

33:28.310 --> 33:30.890
but, you know, I feel you
deserve an explanation.

33:30.890 --> 33:31.940
Trust that sensation, Henry.

33:31.940 --> 33:34.400
We absolutely deserve to know
what you’ve been up to.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.600
Did they tell you
about Greg Haden?

33:36.600 --> 33:37.890
Your head of security

33:37.890 --> 33:39.770
sent Grand Central
Station into a panic.

33:39.770 --> 33:40.900
He’s in lockup
right now.

33:40.900 --> 33:42.890
No, I know, I know.
I’m working on it.

33:42.890 --> 33:46.060
I mean, they should be
throwing him a parade.

33:47.310 --> 33:48.270
He nixed a terrorist attack.

33:48.270 --> 33:49.480
Or maybe just
postponed it.

33:49.480 --> 33:50.480
We don’t really know.

33:50.480 --> 33:51.690
We have to wait and see if

33:51.690 --> 33:52.810
the terrorists want
to try again.

33:52.810 --> 33:55.400
You lost me.
Well, I sent him
over there.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.850
He pulled the alarm.

33:56.850 --> 33:58.400
He sent people running
so they wouldn’t

33:58.400 --> 33:59.810
be a bunch of
sitting ducks

33:59.810 --> 34:01.600
for psychos with assault rifles.

34:01.600 --> 34:04.600
To which psychos
are you referring?

34:04.890 --> 34:08.310
Well, the book
doesn’t really say.

34:10.480 --> 34:11.770
Here.

34:11.770 --> 34:15.350
That’s Norman Horowitz’s
book,Visions.
Yeah.

34:17.060 --> 34:18.060
You’ve heard of it?

34:18.060 --> 34:19.850
Henry, were you helping
Norman with this?

34:19.850 --> 34:22.270
Were you editing
this book for him?

34:22.270 --> 34:24.190
Oh, no, no,
I just got this.

34:24.190 --> 34:25.889
Yeah, no, it’s kind of
a crazy story.

34:25.889 --> 34:27.480
I am, uh... I’m
trying to find

34:27.480 --> 34:29.020
a publisher
just to recoup my costs,

34:29.020 --> 34:32.560
but I mostly bought this
as a public service.

34:32.560 --> 34:33.889
You purchased it today?

34:33.889 --> 34:36.650
$4 million.
I mean, I think I had to.

34:36.650 --> 34:37.650
Honestly,
I think, uh,

34:37.650 --> 34:38.810
Norman’s brother
was overwhelmed

34:38.810 --> 34:40.889
with the responsibility
of having the future

34:40.889 --> 34:41.889
laid out in front of him.

34:41.889 --> 34:43.900
Can you change it?
Should you change it?

34:43.900 --> 34:44.889
He was thinking of

34:44.889 --> 34:45.900
burning this,
which...

34:45.900 --> 34:48.850
David Horowitz sold that to you?

34:49.889 --> 34:51.889
Yeah.

34:53.770 --> 34:55.889
Captain, you need to send
a tactical unit

34:55.889 --> 34:58.890
to David Horowitz’s home
immediately.

35:01.150 --> 35:03.890
Sometimes when you leave
in a hurry,

35:03.890 --> 35:04.980
you forget stuff.

35:04.980 --> 35:06.900
GREGSON: Well, that
ought to slow them down.

35:06.900 --> 35:08.730
About time we
caught a break.

35:08.730 --> 35:09.480
We were late.

35:09.480 --> 35:10.890
David and his
wife were gone

35:10.890 --> 35:12.230
by the time
we got here.

35:12.230 --> 35:13.060
Closets are empty.

35:13.060 --> 35:14.810
Took most of
the family photos

35:14.810 --> 35:15.730
off the wall, too.

35:15.730 --> 35:17.850
I don’t think they’re
planning on coming back.

35:17.850 --> 35:19.060
How’d you figure
these guys out?

35:19.060 --> 35:21.810
I didn’t.
In fact, I helped them

35:21.810 --> 35:22.900
sell their load
of nonsense.

35:22.900 --> 35:24.020
I don’t know about that.

35:24.020 --> 35:25.890
Didn’t you just prove
Norman Horowitz

35:25.890 --> 35:28.230
was no visionary
by living out the day?

35:28.230 --> 35:29.600
This was never about
tricking the public.

35:29.600 --> 35:32.060
The whole show was for
an audience of one man--

35:32.060 --> 35:33.230
Henry Baskerville.

35:33.230 --> 35:34.060
David sold him a load

35:34.060 --> 35:35.310
of magic beans
with the help of

35:35.310 --> 35:37.890
three murders and two
unwitting detectives.

35:37.890 --> 35:38.890
What do you mean?

35:38.890 --> 35:40.730
Henry dropped our names
in interviews a few years ago.

35:40.730 --> 35:42.350
When David read about us,
he knew

35:42.350 --> 35:44.060
how he’d sell
his brother’s book.

35:44.060 --> 35:44.980
HOLMES: It was
the whole reason

35:44.980 --> 35:45.900
he came to us
in the first place.

35:45.900 --> 35:47.690
He knew that we would go
straight to Baskerville

35:47.690 --> 35:49.270
and prime the pump for him.

35:49.890 --> 35:52.100
We were played for fools

35:52.100 --> 35:54.810
by a craven killer.

36:00.090 --> 36:01.890
GREGSON:
That’s not a happy face.

36:01.990 --> 36:04.490
Talked to TSA,
New Jersey State Police,

36:04.490 --> 36:06.240
Homeland Security,
everyone I could think of.

36:06.540 --> 36:07.490
Nothing.

36:07.490 --> 36:09.120
It’s been 48 hours.

36:09.120 --> 36:10.250
If the Horowitzes
were gonna pop up

36:10.250 --> 36:12.700
on the grid, I tend to think
they would have by now.

36:12.700 --> 36:15.620
Every agency I talked to
is going to the wall.

36:15.620 --> 36:19.580
They know these two are persons
of interest in three homicides.

36:19.580 --> 36:21.580
Maybe we can add a fourth.

36:21.830 --> 36:23.490
No way to know
whether Norman himself

36:23.490 --> 36:25.540
got bumped off
to get all this rolling.

36:25.540 --> 36:29.160
I don’t know how much that’ll
turn up the heat on the search,

36:29.160 --> 36:30.330
but I’ll give it a shot.

36:30.330 --> 36:31.910
I really thought
we caught a break

36:31.910 --> 36:33.450
when they forgot
their passports.

36:33.450 --> 36:36.790
I guess $4 million
and a four-hour head start

36:36.790 --> 36:39.160
was enough to get them
out of Dodge.

36:39.160 --> 36:42.290
Anything from Sherlock or Joan?

36:42.290 --> 36:43.040
They got nothing.

36:43.040 --> 36:44.490
She said they’ll be here
tomorrow,

36:44.490 --> 36:46.580
ready to get back on the horse.

36:46.580 --> 36:48.000
Good.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.950
Bet he’ll be in a fun mood.

36:53.490 --> 36:55.870
Yeah.

36:57.410 --> 36:58.580
It was the orange highlighter.

36:58.580 --> 36:59.660
It’s always bad luck.

36:59.660 --> 37:01.120
It was sloth and stupidity

37:01.120 --> 37:02.950
and weakness
and lack of imagination.

37:02.950 --> 37:04.580
You’re really still
blaming yourself?

37:04.580 --> 37:06.950
I point the finger
at guilty people all the time.

37:06.950 --> 37:07.870
No reason to stop today.

37:07.870 --> 37:09.120
David Horowitz could have gotten

37:09.120 --> 37:11.750
Baskerville’s attention
with or without you.

37:11.750 --> 37:13.500
We lent his brother’s prophecies

37:13.500 --> 37:15.490
an air of intrigue,
credibility even.

37:15.490 --> 37:18.290
Do you really think that if we
hadn’t piqued Henry’s interest,

37:18.290 --> 37:20.080
he would have written
a huge check

37:20.080 --> 37:22.040
for a book
of incoherent ramblings?

37:22.040 --> 37:23.870
They might still turn up.

37:23.870 --> 37:25.290
No. They’re gone.

37:25.290 --> 37:26.490
We lost.

37:32.410 --> 37:35.080
Where did this one come from?
I’ve not seen this one.

37:35.080 --> 37:37.790
Oh, David and Luz took most
of their family photos

37:37.790 --> 37:39.830
when they ran, so
Marcus had the guys

37:39.830 --> 37:42.000
grabbing every picture
that was left.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.410
For BOLOs,
things like that.

37:43.410 --> 37:44.490
I took a copy of
everything home,

37:44.490 --> 37:47.540
just in case they turned up
and we had to build a case.

37:47.540 --> 37:49.120
Norman Horowitz
was no visionary.

37:49.120 --> 37:51.370
He didn’t have a clue
about the future.

37:51.370 --> 37:55.500
But you, Watson,
you’re very prescient.

37:56.910 --> 37:58.490
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:58.490 --> 38:01.160
Anything you say can
and will be used

38:01.160 --> 38:02.410
against you in court.

38:02.410 --> 38:03.580
You have the right
to an attorney.

38:03.580 --> 38:06.490
If you can’t afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

38:06.490 --> 38:08.660
They said you told them
where to find us.

38:08.660 --> 38:09.830
How did you know?

38:09.830 --> 38:11.910
How did you know
where we were?

38:11.910 --> 38:14.870
It came to me
in a vision.

38:18.790 --> 38:20.490
BELL:
All right.

38:20.490 --> 38:22.250
That was a cute
line back there,

38:22.250 --> 38:23.450
but you gotta tell me--

38:23.450 --> 38:26.410
how the hell did you know to
search the hold of that boat?

38:26.410 --> 38:28.490
Actually, it really did
come to me in a flash.

38:28.490 --> 38:30.120
It was a picture
that David left behind

38:30.120 --> 38:31.490
of him and his brother
standing

38:31.490 --> 38:33.250
in front of a borrachero tree.

38:33.250 --> 38:35.250
Beautiful plant
with trumpet-shaped flowers.

38:35.250 --> 38:37.490
Now, the borrachero
only grows

38:37.490 --> 38:40.490
in a narrow band
in Colombia and Venezuela.

38:40.490 --> 38:42.200
It’s highly illegal
everywhere else

38:42.200 --> 38:45.410
because its seeds are used
to make scopolamine.

38:45.410 --> 38:46.660
Hideous drug.

38:46.660 --> 38:47.660
I read about this.

38:47.660 --> 38:49.450
They call it
Devil’s Breath, right?

38:49.450 --> 38:51.040
Mmm. Blown into
its victim’s face

38:51.040 --> 38:52.790
or sprinkled
in their drink,

38:52.790 --> 38:54.250
it is harder to trace

38:54.250 --> 38:56.000
and more powerful
than Rohypnol.

38:56.000 --> 39:00.080
Victims are rendered highly
susceptible to suggestion.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.750
That’s how he did it.

39:01.750 --> 39:03.830
Mmm. Now, the victims
display few outward signs,

39:03.830 --> 39:06.910
but their central cortex
is basically hijacked.

39:06.910 --> 39:09.790
In essence, they lose
their free will.

39:09.790 --> 39:12.700
You can convince them
to do anything.

39:13.410 --> 39:15.450
Even jump off
a bloody building.

39:15.450 --> 39:17.450
Now, the presence
of the borrachero

39:17.450 --> 39:18.950
also suggested something else.

39:18.950 --> 39:20.290
An answer to
the question of why

39:20.290 --> 39:22.950
they decided to leave
without their passports.

39:22.950 --> 39:24.290
How so?

39:24.290 --> 39:25.500
The tree is native
to Colombia

39:25.500 --> 39:27.040
and highly illegal
in the States.

39:27.040 --> 39:29.580
Its presence
in a Flushing backyard

39:29.580 --> 39:31.120
led me to question
its origin.

39:31.120 --> 39:33.830
Luz, the wife--
she’s from Colombia.

39:33.830 --> 39:35.700
That’s where I started.

39:35.700 --> 39:36.700
Took a closer look at her.

39:36.700 --> 39:40.330
Turns out her brother
is a crooked import-exporter.

39:40.330 --> 39:41.490
That’s his boat.

39:41.490 --> 39:44.580
It’s due to leave for Bogotá
in two days’ time.

39:44.580 --> 39:46.870
They were going to wait it out,
and then just float away.

39:46.870 --> 39:50.080
You don’t need a passport
to be a stowaway.

39:50.080 --> 39:52.870
They had $4 million
to craft a new life in Bogotá,

39:52.870 --> 39:54.790
so why not start
with new identities?

39:54.790 --> 39:58.490
I guess they’ll get a chance
to do that anyway.

39:58.490 --> 40:02.490
Everybody gets
a cool nickname in prison.

40:08.450 --> 40:10.620
(inhales deeply)

40:11.790 --> 40:13.830
(exhales)

40:16.370 --> 40:19.750
My last will and
testament, revised.

40:19.750 --> 40:22.000
This one’s a lot lighter.

40:22.000 --> 40:22.750
My estate.

40:22.750 --> 40:24.490
You’ll be inheriting
a lot less of it.

40:24.490 --> 40:27.790
You’ll still get the house,
of course, and my brain.

40:27.790 --> 40:31.330
Mmm. There’s always that.

40:31.330 --> 40:33.160
Hope you’re not offended.

40:33.160 --> 40:35.870
It’s your money. You can do
what you want with it.

40:35.870 --> 40:37.490
Well, that’s just it, you see.

40:37.490 --> 40:39.160
I never wanted any part of it.

40:39.160 --> 40:41.540
Everything my father had
seemed ill-gotten,

40:41.540 --> 40:44.040
dirty,
so I turned my back on it.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.500
But then, yesterday,

40:45.500 --> 40:47.490
seeing all that gold,

40:47.490 --> 40:51.040
I realized how untenable
that position is.

40:51.040 --> 40:53.200
It would just sit
in an account,

40:53.200 --> 40:55.250
waiting to be transferred
to you when I died,

40:55.250 --> 40:59.040
and then again sitting there
waiting for you to die.

41:09.120 --> 41:11.830
from your holiday
giving list.

41:13.040 --> 41:14.370
I’m proud of you.

41:14.370 --> 41:15.490
I think you’ll be pleased

41:15.490 --> 41:17.620
with a new venture we’re
funding for the NYPD.

41:17.620 --> 41:20.160
Gun buy-back programs
have reduced

41:20.160 --> 41:21.540
the number of
firearms fatalities

41:21.540 --> 41:23.080
everywhere they’ve
been attempted.

41:23.080 --> 41:26.580
I thought it fitting to make
that donation in your name.

41:26.580 --> 41:28.870
We’re buying
a few thousand guns?

41:28.870 --> 41:30.200
With any luck,
enough New Yorkers

41:30.200 --> 41:31.490

41:31.490 --> 41:35.250
