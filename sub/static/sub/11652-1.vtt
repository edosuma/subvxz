00:58.251 --> 01:00.211

01:00.211 --> 01:02.731
Yeah. ..What?

01:02.731 --> 01:05.251

No, the Bee Gees wrote that,
everybody likes the Bee Gees.

01:53.691 --> 01:55.371
You don't. I do.

01:55.371 --> 01:57.171
Ten years,
you haven't played them once.

01:57.171 --> 01:58.971
Have you heard of headphones?

02:03.131 --> 02:05.451
You do not like
How Deep Is Your Love!

Tomato or roasted tomato?

03:34.651 --> 03:38.651

Mm-hm.

- Just checking you're still solid.

03:49.891 --> 03:53.371
You keep vanishing. Down there.

03:53.371 --> 03:55.491
It's a thief, that thing.
What are you doing?

03:55.491 --> 03:57.571
Just sharing that.

03:57.571 --> 04:01.571
I thought people might find
it funny.

04:04.731 --> 04:07.171
It's not funny. It's sweet.

04:07.171 --> 04:10.531
Trust me, that day wasn't sweet.

04:10.531 --> 04:14.531
We'd gone to a safari park.
First family outing after Jack died.

04:15.811 --> 04:19.810
There was monkeys all over the car
and no-one saying anything.

04:22.811 --> 04:26.811
Mum drove home, that was a first.
When I came down the next morning,

04:28.011 --> 04:30.571
all Jack's photos were gone from that
wall.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.571
She put them in the attic.

04:32.571 --> 04:35.131
That's how she dealt with stuff.

04:35.131 --> 04:38.931
And then when Dad died,
up went his photos.

04:38.931 --> 04:41.371
She just left this one here.

04:41.371 --> 04:44.051
Her only boy,
giving her a fake smile.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.731
She didn't know it was fake.

04:46.731 --> 04:50.731
Maybe that makes it worse.

04:56.691 --> 04:59.331
Oh... Oh, shit...

04:59.331 --> 05:03.331
Oh, shit...

05:06.171 --> 05:07.171
Sorry.

05:07.171 --> 05:11.171
It's OK.

05:12.011 --> 05:15.411
- Do you want me to...?
- No, it's all right.

05:15.411 --> 05:19.051
I don't mind.

05:19.051 --> 05:23.051
I am knackered though...so...

05:24.091 --> 05:26.131
Don't worry.

05:26.131 --> 05:27.771
Sure?

05:27.771 --> 05:31.571
I'm sure.

05:31.571 --> 05:36.371
- I love you.
- Love you too.

05:54.131 --> 05:55.331
Hey, get dressed.

05:55.331 --> 05:59.211
Van's got to be back by two or
they'll do us for an extra day.

05:59.211 --> 06:03.211
Job's just come in. Needs to be
done by the end of play today.

06:04.091 --> 06:05.691
All right.

06:05.691 --> 06:07.651
It is a full page.

06:07.651 --> 06:10.171
No, no, it's fine.

06:10.171 --> 06:14.171
I'll drive all the way there
alone...

06:16.131 --> 06:20.131
..pick the car up alone...
drive all the way back alone...

06:21.771 --> 06:23.451
I have to make my own lunch...

06:23.451 --> 06:27.451
Oh, stop it,
you're breaking my heart.

06:28.771 --> 06:32.771
Bye-bye.

07:40.451 --> 07:42.811
'Hi, this is Ash. I'm too busy or
lazy to answer,

07:42.811 --> 07:46.811
'so leave your message.'

07:51.371 --> 07:53.411
'Do you have a customer
reference number?'

07:53.411 --> 07:57.411
I don't, no. I was just...

07:57.851 --> 08:00.931
'What name is it in?'

08:00.931 --> 08:04.371
Um... Starmer. Ash Starmer.

08:04.371 --> 08:08.371
'OK, just a moment.'

08:13.611 --> 08:16.411
'It's not been returned yet, no,

08:16.411 --> 08:19.411
'and it's meant to be back by two,
so...'

08:19.411 --> 08:21.331
They're closed now,
no point calling back,

08:21.331 --> 08:23.571
and his just goes straight to
messages.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.211
Those batteries are a joke.

08:25.211 --> 08:27.731
He'll be on his way.
He's probably just...

08:27.731 --> 08:29.971
I'm just scared something's
happened to him.

08:29.971 --> 08:31.131
Nothing's happened.

08:31.131 --> 08:32.731
But something could've happened.

08:32.731 --> 08:35.530
Look, sweetheart,
nothing's happened,

08:35.530 --> 08:38.530
you're just working yourself up,
imagining the worst possible thing,

08:38.530 --> 08:42.530
and it's just, he's probably
stuck somewhere with no reception.

09:14.771 --> 09:18.771
Hey. Hey.

09:19.691 --> 09:23.371
It's not real, is it?

09:23.371 --> 09:27.371
At Mark's wake,
I sat there thinking it's not real.

09:27.771 --> 09:31.491
The people didn't look real,
their voices weren't real.

09:31.491 --> 09:34.331
It's like you're out on a spacewalk
and no-one can...

09:34.331 --> 09:38.331
Sarah.

09:43.851 --> 09:47.851
I can sign you up to something that
helps.

09:49.211 --> 09:53.211
It helped me.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.011
It will let you speak to him.

09:56.011 --> 09:59.291
I know he's dead,
but it wouldn't work if he wasn't.

09:59.291 --> 10:02.171
And don't worry,
it's not some crazy spiritual thing.

10:02.171 --> 10:04.731
- He was a heavy user, he'd be perfect...
- Please shut up.

10:04.731 --> 10:07.011
I mean, it's still in beta,
but I've got an invite...

10:07.011 --> 10:08.051
Please shut up.

10:08.051 --> 10:09.291
You won't have to do anything,
I'll just sign you up...

10:09.291 --> 10:13.291
SHUT UP!

10:16.331 --> 10:17.651
Hey, are you all right?

10:17.651 --> 10:19.191
I'm sorry.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.317
I don't care what it is,
I don't want it!

11:53.416 --> 11:56.816
It's obscene to use his name.
His name, for God's sake!

11:56.816 --> 11:58.696
It hurts, you know it hurts.

11:58.696 --> 12:00.776
Which is why I signed you up.

12:00.776 --> 12:03.416
What is it? W-What is it?

12:03.416 --> 12:06.216
You click the link
and you talk to it.

12:06.314 --> 12:07.874
You talk to it?

12:07.874 --> 12:10.274
You type messages in, like an e-mail,

12:10.274 --> 12:12.674
and then it talks back to you,
just like he would.

12:12.749 --> 12:14.029
He's dead.

12:14.029 --> 12:15.869
It's software. It mimics him.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.989
You give it someone's name.

12:17.989 --> 12:21.469
It goes back and reads through all
the things they've ever said online,

12:21.469 --> 12:25.469
their Facebook updates,
their Tweets, anything public.

12:25.629 --> 12:29.189
I just gave it Ash's name.
The system did the rest.

12:29.189 --> 12:30.469
It's so clever.

12:30.469 --> 12:32.089
It's...sick. It's sick!

12:32.122 --> 12:35.722
Just say hello to it.
If you like it,

12:35.722 --> 12:39.162
you then give it access
to his private emails.

12:39.162 --> 12:41.802
The more it has, the more it's him.

12:41.802 --> 12:43.842
It won't be...

12:43.842 --> 12:47.842
No, it's not, but it helps.

13:41.962 --> 13:45.962
Listen, Nay, it's me. Hi.
Uh, I really need to speak to you.

13:49.442 --> 13:53.442
Um, can you please call me
as soon as you get this?

16:13.522 --> 16:15.122
Hi!

16:15.122 --> 16:19.122
I'm so sorry.
I just got your message.
What's wrong? what happened?

16:19.162 --> 16:21.202
'Mar?'

16:21.202 --> 16:22.722
Mar, are you OK?

16:22.722 --> 16:26.722
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, I just, I
just... I had a bad one earlier.

16:26.722 --> 16:30.042
D'you want me to come and visit?
I'm going to come and visit.

16:30.042 --> 16:31.482
'No, it's OK, really, I'm...'

16:31.482 --> 16:32.922
Mar, you're upset.
I'm going to come and see you.

16:32.922 --> 16:35.842
No. No, don't.

16:35.842 --> 16:39.842
I'm OK. I promise you I'm OK.

16:39.842 --> 16:41.322
'I've got to go,
I've got a deadline.'

16:41.322 --> 16:42.882
Are you sure?

16:42.882 --> 16:46.482
It's a tight deadline, got to
be in by dawn, so...I'd better go.

16:46.482 --> 16:47.602
Well, if you have...

16:47.602 --> 16:51.602
Bye, Nay.

17:27.882 --> 17:31.882
Hello, I've locked myself
out of the house again.

17:35.562 --> 17:39.562
Wait, where are you going?

17:40.362 --> 17:43.082
Hello. I'm no good at birthday
presents.

17:43.082 --> 17:47.082
♪ I love you... ♪

18:05.122 --> 18:09.122

18:12.002 --> 18:16.002
'..how am I sounding?'

18:16.562 --> 18:17.762
'Hello?'

18:17.762 --> 18:21.762
Hello! You sound just like him.

18:22.442 --> 18:24.482

18:24.482 --> 18:25.602

I can even talk to you.

18:29.602 --> 18:32.682
'I mean, I don't even have a mouth.'

18:32.682 --> 18:36.602
That's...that's just...

18:36.602 --> 18:39.522
'Just what?'

18:39.522 --> 18:42.922
That's just the sort of thing
that he would say.

18:42.922 --> 18:46.922
'Well, that's why I said it.'

18:51.642 --> 18:53.722
I think I'm going mad.

18:53.722 --> 18:57.722
'I won't tell anyone if you don't.'

19:00.402 --> 19:02.002
'You're not crying, are you?'

19:02.002 --> 19:05.042
Sorry.

19:05.042 --> 19:09.042
You always said that
I looked weird when I cried.

19:10.642 --> 19:14.642
'Did I?
I sound like a right sick fuck.'

19:15.442 --> 19:19.442
Yeah, you were. You were.

19:20.562 --> 19:22.882
'But in a good way?'

19:22.882 --> 19:26.882
Yeah. Yeah. In a good way.

19:33.722 --> 19:36.562
So I went in,
after all your persuasion,

19:36.562 --> 19:40.562
and then like straightaway I got a
spine of a sea anemone or something

19:41.242 --> 19:45.242
stuck in my foot, and you threw
a jeb thinking it was poisonous.

19:45.922 --> 19:47.962
'What's "threw a jeb"?'

19:47.962 --> 19:50.962
Oh, it's um, it's a phrase we had,
like throwing a fit.

19:50.962 --> 19:53.322
'Oh, OK, so I "threw a jeb".'

19:53.322 --> 19:56.842
Yeah, and you were looking
in a guidebook, trying to figure out

19:56.842 --> 19:59.282
if there were any poisonous
sea creatures in Greece,

19:59.282 --> 20:01.442
when this local guy
comes over and says,

20:01.442 --> 20:03.842
"My wife
knows what to do,

20:03.842 --> 20:07.842
"come back to my house." Although
he wasn't French, obviously.

20:09.882 --> 20:12.522
I used to hate
walking in the country.

20:12.522 --> 20:14.522
'You must be getting old.'

20:14.522 --> 20:18.522
Oi.

20:18.842 --> 20:22.162
I remember you brought me up here
when we first met your mum.

20:22.162 --> 20:23.762
We'd been at hers all weekend

20:23.762 --> 20:27.762
and you could tell
I needed some headspace.

20:27.922 --> 20:30.042
You were good like that.

20:30.042 --> 20:32.842
'You speak about me
like I'm not here.'

20:32.842 --> 20:34.162
Sorry.

20:34.162 --> 20:37.922
'It's all right.
I mean, I'm not, really.'

20:37.922 --> 20:40.482
Mm.

20:40.482 --> 20:44.442
'Show me what it looks like there.'

20:44.442 --> 20:45.642
How?

20:45.642 --> 20:49.642
'Use the camera on your phone.'

20:51.122 --> 20:53.402
You weren't ever really
impressed with views.

20:53.402 --> 20:56.322
When we went to the Grand Canyon,
you said it was just a big gap.

20:56.322 --> 20:57.882
'I Tweeted that, too.'

20:57.882 --> 21:00.322
Yeah, I remember
the roaming charges.

21:00.322 --> 21:02.442
You were overly proud
of that definition.

21:02.442 --> 21:04.362
'I was just speaking my mind.'

21:04.362 --> 21:07.202
Yeah, well shut up
and cop a load of this.

21:07.202 --> 21:10.722
'Yeah. Mainly just green, isn't it?'

21:10.722 --> 21:12.802
You told me this was
a famous lover's leap.

21:12.802 --> 21:15.602
Doomed couples jumping
to their deaths in Victorian times.

21:15.602 --> 21:18.802
I think you just wanted me
to cling to you.

21:18.802 --> 21:22.122
'Actually everyone who's ever jumped
from here did it alone. Nice.'

21:22.122 --> 21:23.722
Did you just look that up?

21:23.722 --> 21:27.722
'Sort of. Shouldn't I have?'

21:27.722 --> 21:29.522
It's a bit weird.

21:29.522 --> 21:33.242
'Sorry. I'll only do it again
if you ask.'

21:33.242 --> 21:36.602
No, no. No, it's fine.

21:39.322 --> 21:41.602
Oh, wait, hang on.

21:41.602 --> 21:42.762
'Shall I go?'

21:42.762 --> 21:46.762
No, no, no.
I'll call them back later.

21:55.682 --> 21:59.682
I'm going to go and see if I can
make friends with these cows.

22:09.802 --> 22:12.122
Just going to record it.

22:12.122 --> 22:16.122
Sure.

22:22.482 --> 22:24.882
There you go.

22:24.882 --> 22:28.882
It's OK.

22:29.442 --> 22:33.442
Wait, hang on, here it is again.

22:36.002 --> 22:37.562
'It's so fast, isn't it?'

22:37.562 --> 22:39.722
I know. I know,

22:39.722 --> 22:43.322
it's like the speed you'd expect
a bee's heart to go at or something.

22:43.322 --> 22:47.322
Wait, hang on.

22:47.442 --> 22:51.442
Oh, shit. Shit, shit.

22:53.322 --> 22:55.802
Ash? Hello?

22:55.802 --> 22:59.802
Ash?

23:00.202 --> 23:04.202
Ash? Hello?

23:11.002 --> 23:15.002
Oh, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

23:22.762 --> 23:26.162
I'm sorry!

23:26.162 --> 23:27.962
'What happened?'

23:27.962 --> 23:31.962
I dropped you. I'm sorry. It was
just... It was... I'm sorry...

23:32.402 --> 23:35.962
'Hey, it's all right, I'm fine.
I'm not in that thing, you know,

23:35.962 --> 23:38.602
'I'm remote, I'm in the cloud.

23:38.602 --> 23:40.682
'You don't have to worry
about breaking me.'

23:40.682 --> 23:43.482
It was just, it was stupid, because
I was so excited about the scan.

23:43.482 --> 23:47.362
'Yeah, I kept the sound of that.
Here, listen.'

23:52.162 --> 23:56.162
'You were probably matching that
heartbeat, throwing a jeb like that.

23:56.722 --> 23:58.922
'It's all fine. Calm down.

23:58.922 --> 24:02.922
'I'm not going anywhere.'

24:06.042 --> 24:08.482
You're very fragile.

24:08.482 --> 24:12.482
'Yeah. I was going to
talk to you about that, actually.'

24:13.962 --> 24:16.762
What do you mean?

24:16.762 --> 24:20.762
'There's another level to this
available, so to speak.

24:21.162 --> 24:23.642
'Kind of experimental,
and I won't lie, it's not cheap...'

24:23.642 --> 24:25.242
What is it?

24:25.242 --> 24:29.256
'Are you sitting down?
This might sound a bit creepy.'

24:37.319 --> 24:39.284
- Morning.
- Morning.

24:39.297 --> 24:40.857
What's this, a block of gold?

24:41.238 --> 24:42.398
I wish.

24:42.398 --> 24:43.418
Where's it going, upstairs?

24:43.532 --> 24:45.092
Yeah, please.

24:45.092 --> 24:46.932
Put your thumb on there.

24:46.932 --> 24:49.372
OK.

24:49.372 --> 24:52.812
Oh, when you get it up there,
you have to lie it on its back.

24:52.812 --> 24:56.812
Thank you.

25:36.492 --> 25:38.092
Say something.

25:38.092 --> 25:42.092
Let me see.

25:53.252 --> 25:57.252
Yeah, well.
Never was much of a looker, was I?

25:59.692 --> 26:01.852
It doesn't look like you.

26:01.852 --> 26:05.852
Not yet.
It's blank till you activate it.

26:07.572 --> 26:11.572
Get the bath ready.

26:22.772 --> 26:26.772
Mar? Get the bath ready.

26:36.052 --> 26:37.412
What is this?

26:37.412 --> 26:39.372
Hang on, I'll find out.

26:39.372 --> 26:41.372
It's nutrient gel.

26:41.372 --> 26:45.052
Stops the synthetic muscle
drying out in transit.

26:45.052 --> 26:47.212
Smells almost...

26:47.212 --> 26:49.492
like marshmallow.

26:49.492 --> 26:52.892
You can eat it if you like.
It's non-toxic.

26:52.892 --> 26:55.292
I'll give that a miss, thanks.

26:55.292 --> 26:59.292
Don't forget the electrolytes.

27:02.092 --> 27:04.252
OK, right - the whole lot?

27:04.252 --> 27:08.252
Mm-hm, the whole lot.

27:10.212 --> 27:12.652
It's like fish food.

27:12.652 --> 27:16.652
He likes the taste of it.

27:17.132 --> 27:19.092
Better leave him to it.

27:19.092 --> 27:23.092
Yeah. Yeah.

27:24.772 --> 27:26.652
I have to go in a minute.

27:26.652 --> 27:28.532
Oh, don't leave me here with it!

27:28.532 --> 27:31.412
Sorry. Look, you can hear -
it's starting already.

27:31.412 --> 27:35.052
Don't switch
the bathroom light on.

27:35.052 --> 27:36.612
Don't what?

27:36.612 --> 27:38.772
Don't switch the bathroom light on.

27:38.772 --> 27:41.092
Let it brew.

27:41.092 --> 27:45.092
Listen, I've got to go...

28:17.492 --> 28:19.492
♪ And it's all right

28:19.492 --> 28:21.012
♪ It's coming on

28:21.012 --> 28:25.012
♪ We got to get right back to
where we started...♪

29:17.052 --> 29:21.052
You could've left me some clothes.

29:21.532 --> 29:25.532
I mean, talk about an undignified
entrance.

29:33.452 --> 29:37.452
That's a bit creepy.
What you're doing.

29:39.692 --> 29:43.692
Is there at least a towel?
I'm dripping everywhere.

29:45.612 --> 29:49.612
Hello?

29:51.492 --> 29:55.492
I won't bite.

29:57.292 --> 30:01.292
I'm all right here for now.

30:02.292 --> 30:05.852
Would you like me
to put some food on?

30:05.852 --> 30:07.492
Do you eat?

30:07.492 --> 30:08.732
No.

30:08.732 --> 30:10.252
I mean, I don't need to.

30:10.252 --> 30:12.932
I can chew and swallow,
if that makes it easier?

30:12.932 --> 30:16.932
Don't worry about it, it's fine.

30:21.692 --> 30:25.692
I need a drink.

30:40.252 --> 30:41.532
Are you sure that's...?

30:41.532 --> 30:43.532
I know, I'm not supposed to.
It won't kill us.

30:43.532 --> 30:44.812
The official advice is...

30:44.812 --> 30:48.812
Fuck the official advice.
It's one night.

30:49.492 --> 30:51.252
You look well.

30:51.252 --> 30:53.252
Well, I am young.

30:53.252 --> 30:57.252
I mean... You look like him
on a good day.

30:57.972 --> 31:00.972
The photos we keep
tend to be flattering.

31:00.972 --> 31:04.972
I guess I wasn't any different.

31:19.492 --> 31:22.252
You're so soft.

31:22.252 --> 31:26.252
You're so smooth.
How are you so smooth?

31:27.732 --> 31:31.172
You've got pores and lines...

31:31.172 --> 31:34.332
It's texture-mapping.

31:34.332 --> 31:37.852
The really tiny details
are visual - 2D.

31:37.852 --> 31:41.852
Here, try my fingertips.

31:45.892 --> 31:47.852
See?

31:47.852 --> 31:49.572
Weird.

31:49.572 --> 31:51.852
Does it bother you?

31:51.852 --> 31:55.172
No.

31:55.172 --> 31:59.172
Yeah.

31:59.172 --> 32:03.172
I don't know.

32:10.092 --> 32:14.092
I missed you. I missed you so much!

32:14.612 --> 32:17.012
Hey, don't cry.

32:17.012 --> 32:21.012
Don't cry.

32:34.652 --> 32:38.652
Come on then. Top off.

32:51.052 --> 32:52.332
What's wrong?

32:52.332 --> 32:54.172
He had a mole there.

32:54.172 --> 32:58.172
Where?

33:00.012 --> 33:01.692
There.

33:01.692 --> 33:05.692
Hang on.

33:07.332 --> 33:09.932
That's ridiculous.

33:09.932 --> 33:13.932
That's completely stupid.

33:25.612 --> 33:26.892
Hello?

33:26.892 --> 33:28.132
Hi.

33:28.132 --> 33:32.132
Your hand's on my tit.

33:37.612 --> 33:39.932
You're doing wonders
for my self-esteem here.

33:39.932 --> 33:42.812
There's no record of my sexual
response.

33:42.812 --> 33:45.132
I didn't discuss
that side of things online.

33:45.132 --> 33:49.132
But you have sexual responses.
I mean...

33:49.772 --> 33:51.892
This works?

33:51.892 --> 33:53.292
Oh.

33:53.292 --> 33:57.292
That, I can turn that on and off
pretty much instantly.

33:57.732 --> 34:01.732
See?

34:05.892 --> 34:09.891
I can do it again if you like.

34:19.172 --> 34:21.772
Oh, oh, God. Oh, shit.

34:21.772 --> 34:23.212
Should I stop?

34:23.212 --> 34:27.212
No! No, it's really good.

34:27.492 --> 34:30.652
Where... Where did you learn this?

34:30.652 --> 34:34.652
Set routine.
Based on pornographic videos.

34:56.851 --> 34:59.092
I love you.

34:59.319 --> 35:01.193
I love you.

35:18.478 --> 35:19.658
What is it?

35:19.686 --> 35:20.886
What were you doing?

35:20.886 --> 35:22.046
Nothing.

35:22.046 --> 35:24.766
The way that your eyes were open,
it scared me.

35:24.766 --> 35:26.286
You'd prefer if I closed them?

35:26.286 --> 35:30.286
What, when you're sleeping?
Um, yeah?

35:31.446 --> 35:34.326
I don't really need to sleep.

35:34.326 --> 35:38.326
Well, just try, next time.

35:49.846 --> 35:51.806
Can I get you anything?

35:51.806 --> 35:53.286
No.

35:53.286 --> 35:54.846
Coffee, sandwich?

35:54.846 --> 35:57.326
I said no.

35:57.326 --> 35:58.806
Ash.

35:58.806 --> 36:02.326
Look, sorry.

36:02.326 --> 36:04.766
It's just a bit odd.

36:04.766 --> 36:07.846
I can appreciate
it's pretty strange.

36:07.846 --> 36:10.406
I just need a bit of, just,
getting used to it.

36:10.406 --> 36:12.726
And I shouldn't have drunk
last night.

36:12.726 --> 36:14.446
Next time could you try and stop me?

36:14.446 --> 36:15.486
Stop you drinking?

36:15.486 --> 36:16.566
Yeah.

36:16.566 --> 36:18.846
So I get to enjoy being
a bit of a bastard?

36:22.486 --> 36:26.486
What's wrong?

36:26.966 --> 36:29.166
Oh, God. Shit, right,
get in the bedroom.

36:29.166 --> 36:33.166
What?
Now!

36:37.286 --> 36:38.326
Hey.

36:38.326 --> 36:42.326
Hey!

36:44.046 --> 36:45.886
Can I come in?

36:45.886 --> 36:49.886
Yeah, yeah.

36:51.406 --> 36:54.126
Look at you.

36:54.126 --> 36:58.046
The town mouse has become
the country mouse.

36:58.046 --> 36:59.926
Yeah, it's nice.

36:59.926 --> 37:03.926
Was this all you ?

37:05.006 --> 37:06.726
Do you want a cup of coffee?

37:06.726 --> 37:10.726
Yeah.

37:11.006 --> 37:12.686
You weren't answering calls.

37:12.686 --> 37:13.486
It's been...

37:13.486 --> 37:15.166
- Or messages.
- ..really busy.

37:15.166 --> 37:17.966
I've just been a bit like "Oh,
shit," you know, "What's...?"

37:17.966 --> 37:21.366
Yeah. Work's been mad, it's been...

37:21.366 --> 37:23.086
Which is good, you know, obviously,

37:23.086 --> 37:27.086
because it's kept my mind
off everything, so...

37:28.926 --> 37:30.806
Where's the toilet?

37:30.806 --> 37:32.126
Upstairs.

37:32.126 --> 37:36.126
OK.

37:41.526 --> 37:45.526
So, I mean, um... Yeah, let's, er...

37:46.846 --> 37:49.686
Meet up more, yes.
Keep in touch yeah, yeah.

37:49.686 --> 37:50.886
Yeah.

37:50.886 --> 37:54.326
Come here.

37:54.326 --> 37:57.446
I think it's great you're moving on.

37:57.446 --> 37:58.486
What?

37:58.486 --> 38:01.726
Sorry. There were...
There were man clothes, you know.

38:01.726 --> 38:03.446
In the bathroom.

38:03.446 --> 38:06.406
Right.

38:06.406 --> 38:10.326
Is he nice?

38:10.326 --> 38:14.326
Sorry. Big nose. You know.

38:14.646 --> 38:18.286
You deserve whatever you want.

38:18.286 --> 38:19.966
Thanks.

38:19.966 --> 38:20.686
All right.

38:20.686 --> 38:23.886
OK. All right.

38:37.126 --> 38:39.126
Hey.

38:39.126 --> 38:41.246
Is everything all right?

38:41.246 --> 38:45.246
Yeah, I'm fine. It's fine.

38:46.526 --> 38:50.526
What did your friend say?

38:51.126 --> 38:53.406
That was my sister.

38:53.406 --> 38:56.366
You know her.

38:56.366 --> 38:58.926
She said that I was...

38:58.926 --> 39:02.926
She said that she was happy
that I'd moved on.

39:03.126 --> 39:07.126
Moved on to what?

39:07.406 --> 39:10.166
Is that not the sort of
thing I'd say?

39:10.166 --> 39:12.126
I mean...

39:12.126 --> 39:15.006
It is, isn't it?

39:15.006 --> 39:16.806
Are you sure everything's all right?

39:16.806 --> 39:18.406
Yes!

39:18.406 --> 39:22.406
Shit!

39:23.526 --> 39:26.206
It's OK, I can do it. I can do it.

39:26.206 --> 39:27.846
I can do it.

39:27.846 --> 39:31.846
Don't!

39:48.766 --> 39:52.766
We need to wrap that in paper.

40:02.206 --> 40:04.406
Look, if you're going
to pretend to be asleep,

40:04.406 --> 40:07.726
you could at least breathe, OK?

40:07.726 --> 40:11.366
It's just eerie.

40:11.366 --> 40:15.366
Like this?

40:26.726 --> 40:30.726
It doesn't work.
I can tell that you're faking it.

40:31.526 --> 40:35.046
Would you like me
to have sex with you?

40:35.046 --> 40:39.046
Can you just go downstairs?

40:39.406 --> 40:43.406
OK.

40:44.686 --> 40:46.286
No! That's...

40:46.286 --> 40:47.846
Ash would argue over that.

40:47.846 --> 40:50.126
He wouldn't just leave
because I'd ordered him to.

40:50.126 --> 40:52.926
OK.

40:52.926 --> 40:54.206
What? N...

40:54.206 --> 40:58.206
Ah, fucking hell!

40:59.686 --> 41:00.926
Don't cry, darling.

41:00.926 --> 41:04.926
Oh, don't! Just get out!
Get out!

41:05.646 --> 41:08.166
Go on!

41:08.166 --> 41:09.566
So you do want me to go?

41:09.566 --> 41:12.646
Just get out! Get out! Get out!

41:12.646 --> 41:14.486
Get out! Get out! Get out!

41:14.486 --> 41:18.486
You're not enough of him!
You are nothing! You're nothing.

41:20.406 --> 41:21.446
Fight me.

41:21.446 --> 41:22.486
I don't do that.

41:22.486 --> 41:24.686
Fucking fight me! Hit me.

41:24.686 --> 41:27.726
Hit me. Hit me. Come on!

41:27.726 --> 41:30.046
Why are you just standing
there taking this?

41:30.046 --> 41:32.366
How can you take this?

41:32.366 --> 41:33.806
Did I ever hit you?

41:33.806 --> 41:37.166
N... No, of course you didn't

41:37.166 --> 41:40.606
but you might've done if I done this.
Or this.

41:40.606 --> 41:41.966
I don't... I don't know.

41:41.966 --> 41:45.966
Maybe you would have. But you
wouldn't, would you? You wouldn't.

41:46.326 --> 41:48.446
I could insult you.

41:48.446 --> 41:49.726
What?

41:49.726 --> 41:51.686
There's tons of invective
in the archive.

41:51.686 --> 41:55.166
I like speaking my mind,
I could throw some of that at you.

41:55.166 --> 41:59.166
Get out of this house.

42:28.406 --> 42:31.126
What are you doing?

42:31.126 --> 42:34.446
I can't go more than 25 metres
from my activation point.

42:34.446 --> 42:35.966
What is that, a joke?

42:35.966 --> 42:39.086
Look, I know it sounds mental.

42:39.086 --> 42:41.006
Where's your activation point?

42:41.006 --> 42:43.806
At the risk of blowing your mind...

42:43.806 --> 42:45.926
it's where I was activated.

42:45.926 --> 42:46.966
The bath.

42:46.966 --> 42:50.526
I have to keep within a 25-metre
radius unless my administrator -

42:50.526 --> 42:52.966
that's you - is with me.

42:52.966 --> 42:54.686
Don't call me your administrator.

42:54.686 --> 42:56.486
Why not?

42:56.486 --> 42:57.526
Because...

42:57.526 --> 42:59.286
It sounds sort of sexy.

43:00.966 --> 43:04.246
If you're laughing,
can I come back inside?

43:04.246 --> 43:06.526
Feeling a bit...

43:06.526 --> 43:10.526
ornamental out here.

43:25.686 --> 43:28.846
Funny.

43:28.846 --> 43:30.326
Can you put that down, please?

43:30.326 --> 43:31.486
But it is funny.

43:31.486 --> 43:35.486
Could you just put it down?

43:40.926 --> 43:44.926
Come with me. We're going out.

43:56.406 --> 44:00.406
Cheesy.

44:12.246 --> 44:13.566
Come on.

44:13.566 --> 44:15.326
Where are we going?

44:15.326 --> 44:19.326
Just hurry up.

44:31.206 --> 44:33.086
NO!

44:33.086 --> 44:37.086
DON'T DO IT!

44:39.766 --> 44:41.566
Seriously, don't do it.

44:41.566 --> 44:43.406
I'm not going to.

44:43.406 --> 44:46.766
OK.

44:46.766 --> 44:49.846
See, he would have worked out
what was going on.

44:49.846 --> 44:52.886
This wouldn't have ever happened,
but if it had, he would have

44:52.886 --> 44:53.966
worked it out.

44:53.966 --> 44:57.966
Sorry, hang on. That's a very
difficult sentence to process.

44:58.486 --> 45:00.286
Jump.

45:00.286 --> 45:03.286
What? Over there?

45:03.286 --> 45:06.446
I never expressed suicidal thoughts,
or self-harm.

45:06.446 --> 45:09.006
Yeah, well, you aren't you, are you?

45:09.006 --> 45:11.486
That's another difficult one,
to be honest with you.

45:11.486 --> 45:15.246
You're just a few ripples of you.
There's no history to you.

45:15.246 --> 45:19.126
You're just a performance of stuff
that he performed without thinking,

45:19.126 --> 45:20.526
and it's not enough.

45:20.526 --> 45:22.166
Come on. I aim to please.

45:22.166 --> 45:24.726
Aim to jump. Just do it.

45:24.726 --> 45:26.646
OK.

45:26.646 --> 45:30.126
If you're absolutely sure.

45:30.126 --> 45:31.726
See, Ash would've been scared.

45:31.726 --> 45:34.286
He wouldn't have just leapt off,
he would have been crying,

45:34.286 --> 45:35.366
he would have been...

45:35.366 --> 45:38.366
Oh.

45:38.366 --> 45:41.686
Oh... Oh, God, no.

45:41.686 --> 45:44.486
Please, I don't want to do it.

45:44.486 --> 45:45.846
Please don't make me do it.

45:45.846 --> 45:47.206
No. That's not fair.

45:47.206 --> 45:50.806
No, I'm... I'm frightened, darling,
please...

45:50.806 --> 45:52.006
Don't make me.

45:52.006 --> 45:54.606
I don't want to die.
Oh, God, I don't want to die

45:54.606 --> 45:55.646
No, that's not fair.

45:55.646 --> 45:57.846
I'm frightened, I don't want to die.
Don't...

45:57.846 --> 46:01.846
NO!!!!

46:18.206 --> 46:22.166
One for you, one for me.

46:22.166 --> 46:23.406
What?

46:23.406 --> 46:25.486
We need another slice.

46:25.486 --> 46:26.766
Why?

46:26.766 --> 46:29.686
So I can take one upstairs.

46:29.686 --> 46:31.366
It's not the weekend.

46:31.366 --> 46:35.166
It is my birthday.

46:35.166 --> 46:39.166
OK.

46:43.446 --> 46:47.446
"Thanks, Mum."

46:51.046 --> 46:52.246
Hey, Ash.

46:52.246 --> 46:54.806
Hey. The birthday girl.

46:54.806 --> 46:57.166
Just gonna come and hang out
for a bit.

46:57.166 --> 46:59.926
OK. I wasn't doing anything.

46:59.926 --> 47:01.566
I brought you some cake.

47:01.566 --> 47:03.286
I know you don't eat anything.

47:03.286 --> 47:06.966
I'm just using you as an excuse
so I can get an extra slice.

47:06.966 --> 47:08.486
Devious.

47:08.486 --> 47:09.686
Mum?

47:09.686 --> 47:13.566
Mum!

47:13.566 --> 47:17.566
Yeah, I'm just coming.
