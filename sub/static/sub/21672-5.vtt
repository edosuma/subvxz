I'm like, "what's...

04:08.090 --> 04:09.480
(All) Yes, Chef.

04:09.490 --> 04:13.580
It is amazing that beautiful art
can be created with a chain saw.

<i>Now, there's a tool that
every great Chef needs</i>

04:16.600 --> 04:19.459

04:28.670 --> 04:30.030
<i>from around the world.</i>

04:30.040 --> 04:33.500

your ability to identify

that protein in each of
the five domed dishes

04:36.120 --> 04:37.770
<i>in front of you.</i>

04:37.780 --> 04:39.010

04:44.620 --> 04:45.920
Each time will compete in pairs.

04:45.930 --> 04:48.350
The first pair will move the first dome,

04:48.360 --> 04:49.620
taste the dish,

04:49.630 --> 04:53.260
and then decide together
what protein is in the dish.

04:53.270 --> 04:56.260
You'll run to the Hell's Kitchen
protein display behind me,

04:56.270 --> 04:59.530
<i>select the protein, and
run it back to the table.</i>

04:59.540 --> 05:03.700

light will turn green.

The team to correctly identify
the protein in each five dishes

05:07.610 --> 05:09.610

(All) Yes, Chef.

previous dinner service,

06:41.910 --> 06:43.100
This challenge is so difficult

06:43.110 --> 06:45.270
because it's not just a protein on a plate.

You have all these other
flavors masking that protein,

It's calamari, love.

07:37.400 --> 07:38.520
Come on!

07:38.530 --> 07:39.590
- Calamari, Chef.
- Calamari.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.590
Yes!

07:40.600 --> 07:41.590
Nice, nice.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.860
Finally.

07:42.870 --> 07:43.860
Go, Sade, go!

07:43.870 --> 07:44.860
You got this, girl.

07:44.870 --> 07:45.860
<i>(Sade)</i> <i>It's lasagna.</i>

07:45.870 --> 07:47.300
<i>(Kalen)</i> <i>Taste it.</i>

07:47.310 --> 07:49.260
(Narrator) After a slow
start by the first two pairs

07:49.270 --> 07:50.500
that consumed over three minutes

07:50.510 --> 07:52.070
of the clock, Sade...

07:52.080 --> 07:53.540
- Antelope, Chef.
- No!

07:53.550 --> 07:55.440
(Narrator) Hopes to
impress with her palate,

07:55.450 --> 07:57.040
tasting and running solo.

07:57.050 --> 07:58.710
<i>(Gordon)</i> <i>Come on, Sade.</i>

07:58.720 --> 08:00.210
(Sade) It's gamey. I'ma try it.

08:00.220 --> 08:02.540
- <i>Run back!</i> 
- <i>You got it, you got it,</i> <i>you got it.</i>

08:02.550 --> 08:03.550
Elk.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.750
- Yes! Good job.
- (All) Yes!

08:05.760 --> 08:07.550
Go, go, ladies. Go, ladies, go.

08:07.560 --> 08:08.680
<i>(Gordon)</i> <i>Let's go.</i> All right.

08:08.690 --> 08:09.920
<i>(Kalen)</i> <i>It's a bowl of chili.</i>

08:09.930 --> 08:12.290
- Looks like turkey.
- There's already turkey.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.490
It's clearly a white meat,

08:13.500 --> 08:15.620
so we instantly just go for chicken,

08:15.630 --> 08:18.490
because maybe it's gonna
be the obvious one.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.760
Chicken. <i>No!</i>

08:19.770 --> 08:20.760
Come on.

08:20.770 --> 08:22.500
Seriously, girls? [Bleep] chicken?

08:22.510 --> 08:25.300
This is <i> Hell's Kitchen.</i> It's
never gonna be that easy.

08:25.310 --> 08:26.340
(Both) Pork, Chef.

08:26.350 --> 08:27.840
No! Come on.

08:27.850 --> 08:29.770
Keep going, blondes. Come on.

08:29.780 --> 08:31.210
What the [Bleep] is it?

08:31.220 --> 08:32.470
<i>It tastes</i> <i>like chili.</i>

08:32.480 --> 08:33.510
What color is it?

08:33.520 --> 08:34.510
<i>(Kalen)</i> <i>It's just white.</i>

08:34.520 --> 08:35.510
Alligator!

08:35.520 --> 08:37.110
- Alligator?
- [Bleep] It.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.150
Everything else is wrong. Grab alligator.

08:39.159 --> 08:40.150
(Both) Alligator, Chef!

08:40.159 --> 08:41.620
- Yes!
- (All) Yes!

08:41.630 --> 08:42.820
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

08:42.830 --> 08:44.290
Alligator chili.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.420
- Go.
- Whoo!

08:45.430 --> 08:46.490
<i>One more, ladies.</i>

08:46.500 --> 08:47.890
<i>It's pot stickers.</i>

08:47.900 --> 08:49.390
Come on, come on. We got this.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.690
(Narrator) With the clock
already over six minutes...

08:51.700 --> 08:53.230
Pork, pork, pork.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.130
(Narrator) Katie and Roe are
looking to redeem themselves

08:55.140 --> 08:56.570
on their second attempt.

08:56.580 --> 08:58.270
- Pork, Chef!
- No!

08:58.280 --> 08:59.400
[Bleep]! Keep going.

08:59.410 --> 09:00.740
<i>What can go</i> <i>inside of a dumpling?</i>

09:00.750 --> 09:02.100
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit.

09:02.110 --> 09:04.470
- Rabbit, Chef!
- No!

09:04.480 --> 09:06.410
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

09:06.420 --> 09:08.010
Come on. [Bleep] Roe.

09:08.020 --> 09:10.050
- Lamb?
- No!

09:10.060 --> 09:11.050
[Bleep] Katie.

09:11.060 --> 09:12.610
- Boar, Chef!
- <i>No!</i>

09:12.620 --> 09:14.780
You're, like, supposed
to be our strong girls,

09:14.790 --> 09:15.780
but I don't see it.

09:15.790 --> 09:17.790
- Goat, Chef.
- No!

09:17.800 --> 09:19.350
Come on, guys! We are at seven minutes!

09:19.360 --> 09:20.620
<i>Let's go!</i>

09:20.630 --> 09:22.460
- Squab, Chef.
- No!

09:22.470 --> 09:23.460
Oh, my God.

09:23.470 --> 09:25.590
Garlic, soy sauce, wasabi,

09:25.600 --> 09:27.160
I'm not tasting anything else...

09:27.170 --> 09:28.300
- Quail.
- <i>No!</i>

09:28.310 --> 09:31.430
Except the burning sensation in my mouth.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.530
(Gordon) Come on, come
on. Come on, come on.

09:32.540 --> 09:34.000
- All right, it's pink.
- Got it.

09:34.010 --> 09:35.370
<i>Come on!</i> It's got to be.

09:35.380 --> 09:36.540
Come on!

09:36.550 --> 09:37.540
Duck.

09:37.550 --> 09:38.540
<i>(Gordon)</i> <i>Yes!</i>

09:38.550 --> 09:41.280
- [Bleep].
- 7:41.

09:41.290 --> 09:43.280
Oh, my God. <i>That's horrible.</i>

09:43.290 --> 09:44.650
<i>(Gordon)</i> <i>We'll see</i> <i>if it holds up.</i>

09:44.660 --> 09:46.880
(La Tasha) This doesn't really feel good,

09:46.890 --> 09:49.690
but if we struggle this long,

09:49.700 --> 09:52.960
hopefully the boys are
gonna struggle a lot longer.

09:52.970 --> 09:54.290
Okay.

09:54.300 --> 09:58.790
Gentlemen, the time to beat is 7:41.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.330
[Whistles]

10:00.340 --> 10:01.760
[Laughs]

10:01.770 --> 10:03.630
It took you 7 minutes and 41 seconds

10:03.640 --> 10:05.330
to figure out 5 dishes?

10:05.340 --> 10:06.940
I mean, were you fondling it, licking it?

10:06.950 --> 10:09.710
What were you doing with the food, ladies?

10:09.720 --> 10:12.040
(Gordon) 7:40 is gonna clinch it.

10:12.050 --> 10:14.640
As you start, that clock
is gonna click down.

10:14.650 --> 10:17.780
If it gets to zero, it is
over for the blue team.

10:17.790 --> 10:18.880
<i>Who's going first, please?</i>

10:18.890 --> 10:21.450
Fernando and Santos.

10:21.460 --> 10:23.250
- Are you ready?
- (Both) Yes, Chef.

10:23.260 --> 10:28.020
On your mark, set, go!

10:28.030 --> 10:30.660
(Santos) Lift it, lift it, lift it.

10:30.670 --> 10:31.660
Take the crust off.

10:31.670 --> 10:33.960
It looks like a veal or chicken.

10:33.970 --> 10:36.000
You know, those are usually
your standard cutlets.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.700
- Veal, veal, veal.
- Grab it, grab it, grab it.

10:37.710 --> 10:39.030
(Frank) Right there in front
of you! There, boom, run!

10:39.040 --> 10:40.140
- Shout it out.
- Veal.

10:40.150 --> 10:41.940
No! Quick!

10:41.950 --> 10:43.770
Chicken, chicken, chicken.

10:43.780 --> 10:44.770
On the side! On the side!

10:44.780 --> 10:45.840
The right.

10:45.850 --> 10:47.380
Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken.

10:47.390 --> 10:48.710
<i>(Gordon)</i> <i>Shout it out.</i>

10:48.720 --> 10:50.150
- Chicken.
- No!

10:50.160 --> 10:51.280
<i>Taste it again.</i>

10:51.290 --> 10:52.710
- It's very dry.
- That's turkey.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.950
Turkey. Let's go.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.320
Come on! <i>Come on,</i> <i>come on, come on.</i>

10:56.330 --> 10:57.320
(Gordon) Man.

10:57.330 --> 10:58.320
Turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey.

10:58.330 --> 10:59.350
Quick, Santos!

10:59.360 --> 11:01.120
(Santos) There's so many proteins.

11:01.130 --> 11:03.930
We're just searching for
this [Bleep] big-ass bird.

11:03.940 --> 11:04.960
<i>Turkey, turkey,</i> <i>turkey!</i>

11:04.970 --> 11:06.030

11:08.410 --> 11:09.870
Man! Shout it out.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.230
- (Both) Turkey!
- <i>Yes!</i>

11:11.240 --> 11:12.400
Bing.

11:12.410 --> 11:13.570
Finally. Next!

11:13.580 --> 11:15.640
Go, go, go, go. Next, next, come on.

11:15.650 --> 11:16.710
<i>Soup?</i> <i>Go, guys. Let's go.</i>

11:16.720 --> 11:17.910
(Steve) Where's the protein?

11:17.920 --> 11:19.070
Everything's diced up.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.210
You're eating it, and it's like,

11:20.220 --> 11:21.440
"this could be anything.
This could be anything.

11:21.450 --> 11:22.640
This could be anything."

11:22.650 --> 11:24.210
Hurry up! It's not lunch, guys.

11:24.220 --> 11:25.650
Scallop. Come on.

11:25.660 --> 11:26.650
Come on.

11:26.660 --> 11:28.420
Scallop.

11:28.430 --> 11:29.480
Go, come on, come on, come on.

11:29.490 --> 11:31.120

11:31.130 --> 11:32.550
<i>Come on, guys!</i> <i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

11:32.560 --> 11:33.560
<i>Let's go, let's go.</i> <i>Let's go, go, go.</i>

11:33.570 --> 11:35.320
- (Both) Clams!
- <i>No!</i>

11:35.330 --> 11:36.760
Your head's racing a mile a minute.

11:36.770 --> 11:38.160
You're just going nonstop,

11:38.170 --> 11:40.130
but I know it's got to be
something from the ocean.

11:40.140 --> 11:42.000
- Alligator!
- <i>No!</i>

11:42.010 --> 11:44.170
Alligator chowder? What?

11:44.180 --> 11:45.570
[Chuckles]

11:45.580 --> 11:48.200
Time's a-ticking, fools,
and you're [Bleep] up.

11:48.210 --> 11:50.270
- Cod!
- No!

11:50.280 --> 11:51.270
[Bleep].

11:51.280 --> 11:52.840
- Monkfish.
- No!

11:52.850 --> 11:54.080
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

11:54.090 --> 11:55.480
<i>(Gordon)</i> <i>Come on.</i> <i>Taste it again.</i>

11:55.490 --> 11:56.780
Taste! Taste it!

11:56.790 --> 11:59.180
Boys, just taste it. Put
it in your mouth, come on.

11:59.190 --> 12:00.580
Squid. Come on.

12:00.590 --> 12:01.780
- Yeah, squid.
- <i>Come on!</i>

12:01.790 --> 12:03.150
<i>Come on, come on,</i> <i>come on, come on.</i>

(Both) Squid!

12:06.060 --> 12:07.060
Yes!

12:07.070 --> 12:08.420
Can I get an amen?

12:08.430 --> 12:09.560
- <i>Next!</i>
- Go, go, go, go, go.

12:09.570 --> 12:10.890
<i>Bloody hell.</i>

12:10.900 --> 12:12.290
(Fernando) Something brown, guys.

12:12.300 --> 12:13.300
Take the pasta out.

12:13.310 --> 12:14.660
I need to win this for my team.

12:14.670 --> 12:16.100
This is my chance at redemption.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.130
Come on!

12:17.140 --> 12:18.700
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

12:18.710 --> 12:21.240
<i>(Frank)</i> <i>Oh, what could it be?</i>

12:21.250 --> 12:22.300
Elk!

12:22.310 --> 12:23.670
No, no, no. It's not that. No!

12:23.680 --> 12:26.680
Elk? Who the [Bleep] is eating elk?

12:26.690 --> 12:28.040
- Elk.
- <i>Yes!</i>

12:28.050 --> 12:29.040
Really?

12:29.050 --> 12:30.180
Great job.

12:30.190 --> 12:31.680
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Good job, good job.

12:31.690 --> 12:32.780
<i>(Aaron)</i> <i>Chili!</i>

12:32.790 --> 12:34.050

12:34.060 --> 12:36.520
Aaron's on his own to
identify the alligator.

12:36.530 --> 12:37.620
You got this. Come on. Come on. Come on.

12:37.630 --> 12:38.750
Oh, my God.

12:38.760 --> 12:40.960
This is a really spicy dish.

12:40.970 --> 12:42.560
It's so [Bleep] covered up with [Bleep].

12:42.570 --> 12:43.890
<i>That's a cajun dish, man.</i>

12:43.900 --> 12:45.630
It's alligator. Alligator.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.230
Man, I'm from the dirty south.

12:47.240 --> 12:50.470
That's alligator right off
the damn dune, you know?

12:50.480 --> 12:52.030
- Buffalo! [Bleep].
- <i>No!</i>

12:52.040 --> 12:53.940
Alligator, man. It's cajun.

12:53.950 --> 12:55.700
(Sade) Sterling is yelling alligator,

12:55.710 --> 12:58.640
but nobody is listening to
him, and I'm like, "yes.

12:58.650 --> 13:01.510
This is the perfect time for
you guys to ignore his ass."

13:01.520 --> 13:02.510
- Chicken!
- <i>No!</i>

13:02.520 --> 13:04.410
- [Bleep].
- <i>No, alligator, man!</i>

13:04.420 --> 13:05.650
- Come on!
- All right, Sterling.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.720
Sterling, I'm sure you're right right now!

13:07.730 --> 13:08.720
- Alligator!
- Yes!

13:08.730 --> 13:10.190
- Thank you!
- <i>Go, go, go!</i>

13:10.200 --> 13:11.550
Thank you!

13:11.560 --> 13:13.220
You even from the south, and
you can't recognize that.

13:13.230 --> 13:15.360
[Bleep] yeah.

13:15.370 --> 13:16.930
Last one! 2 1/2 minutes.

13:16.940 --> 13:17.930
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

13:17.940 --> 13:19.060
<i>It's a white meat.</i>

13:19.070 --> 13:20.700
- Concentrate. Think about it.
- <i>Rabbit. Rabbit.</i>

13:20.710 --> 13:21.960
Don't rush.

13:21.970 --> 13:23.670
I feel the texture of it, and I'm thinking,

13:23.680 --> 13:25.800
you know, it has to be
something a little out there,

13:25.810 --> 13:27.470
so, you know, let's do rabbit.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.040
- Rabbit!
- <i>No!</i>

13:29.050 --> 13:30.240
[Bleep].

- <i>Quick!</i> 
- Go, go, go! Come on, guys!

13:32.080 --> 13:34.180
- Quail!
- No!

13:34.190 --> 13:35.380
(All) Rabbit.

13:35.390 --> 13:37.450
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit. Come on!

13:37.460 --> 13:38.780
Seriously?

13:38.790 --> 13:41.420
Boys, you've already chosen this once.

13:41.430 --> 13:42.950
You just did rabbit, man!

13:42.960 --> 13:44.690
Rabbit! No!

13:44.700 --> 13:48.020
Oh, no. This isn't happening!

13:48.030 --> 13:49.560
90 seconds to go.

13:49.570 --> 13:52.660
- (Both) Squab!
- <i>No!</i>

13:52.670 --> 13:54.260
There's hope. There's hope.

13:54.270 --> 13:55.860
Come on, come on.

13:55.870 --> 13:57.770
It's very... what do you
want? What do you want?

13:57.780 --> 13:58.770
Let's do... ostrich?

13:58.780 --> 14:00.270
No, no, no, no. It's white.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.140
- Duck!
- Duck? No.

14:02.150 --> 14:03.670
- Goat? Goat?
- Come on!

14:03.680 --> 14:05.740
Oh, my God, I pray that this duck

14:05.750 --> 14:08.280
disappears right now, so
they can never find it.

14:08.290 --> 14:09.680
Guys, come on. Pick something.

14:09.690 --> 14:11.110

14:13.360 --> 14:14.450
Decide!

14:14.460 --> 14:16.180
Oh, [Bleep]. I have no clue what it is.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.720
Please, please, please.

Come on.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.920
(Narrator) The women posted a
time of 7 minutes and 41 seconds.

14:37.930 --> 14:39.490
The men are on their final dish,

14:39.500 --> 14:42.920
but Fernando and Santos'
inability to identify duck...

14:42.930 --> 14:44.360
- Quail!
- No!

14:44.370 --> 14:45.790
- Rabbit!
- No!

14:45.800 --> 14:47.590
- Squab!

14:51.010 --> 14:53.230

Buffalo or ostrich. Something white.

15:09.460 --> 15:10.950
<i>White meat, guys.</i>

15:10.960 --> 15:12.450
It's down to 40 seconds.

15:12.460 --> 15:14.790
Please don't let them grab the duck.

15:14.800 --> 15:15.920
Don't grab the duck.

Look, look.

[All cheering]

15:33.180 --> 15:35.110
We [Bleep] won! Whoo!

15:35.120 --> 15:38.880
That's a lot of spices
to [Bleep] duck, man.

15:38.890 --> 15:40.750
Men, good job. Well done.

15:40.760 --> 15:41.910
[All cheer]

15:41.920 --> 15:43.650
I hope all of you are in the mood

15:43.660 --> 15:45.890
for something truly spectacular.

15:45.900 --> 15:49.990
You are gonna be enjoying
the ultimate fun in the sun

15:50.000 --> 15:52.190
at the amazing Annenberg beach house

15:52.200 --> 15:53.190
in Santa Monica.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.060
Yes, thank you, lord.

15:55.070 --> 15:57.460
This dude come from the ghetto

15:57.470 --> 16:00.200
is going to the beach house, baby!

16:00.210 --> 16:02.870
How do you like them apples, man?

16:02.880 --> 16:06.110
I've got some very special
guests stopping by.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.540
Go and get changed because your
chauffeured convertibles...

16:08.550 --> 16:10.540
[All cheering]

16:10.550 --> 16:12.080
Are waiting outside.

16:12.090 --> 16:13.180
Enjoy, guys.

16:13.190 --> 16:14.910
- Congratulations.
- (All) Thank you, Chef!

16:14.920 --> 16:16.520
<i>Let's go!</i> <i>Finally!</i>

16:16.530 --> 16:17.620
Whoo!

16:17.630 --> 16:20.090
<i>Ladies, you're in</i> <i>for a tough one.</i>

16:20.100 --> 16:21.390
Exhausting labor,

16:21.400 --> 16:24.490
because tonight is family
night in Hell's Kitchen.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.290
<i>You'll be setting up</i> <i>a stunning</i>

16:26.300 --> 16:27.860
make-your-own pizza station.

16:27.870 --> 16:30.730
That pizza station will
require some extra ingredients.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.070
<i>You'll be carrying</i> <i>50-pound bags</i>

16:33.080 --> 16:34.370
<i>of flour, fresh tomatoes,</i>

16:34.380 --> 16:37.770
and of course pounds and pounds of cheese.

16:37.780 --> 16:40.510
I want them hand-grated.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.810
<i>It's much better of a texture
when you hand-grate a cheese,</i>

16:42.820 --> 16:43.810
<i>as you know.</i>

16:43.820 --> 16:45.380
Hand-grated cheese for texture?

16:45.390 --> 16:48.480
Once you melt it, it doesn't
matter if you hand-grated it.

16:48.490 --> 16:50.280
You're just doing this to be mean!

16:50.290 --> 16:51.550
Start unloading that truck.

16:51.560 --> 16:52.520
Get out of here.

16:52.530 --> 16:55.390
(All) Yes, Chef.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.390
(All) We going to the beach, yeah!

16:57.400 --> 16:59.120
We going to the beach, yeah!

16:59.130 --> 17:00.490
We going to the beach, yeah!

17:00.500 --> 17:02.460
<i>Beach, baby!</i> <i>Whoo!</i>

17:02.470 --> 17:04.930
(Sterling) 100 is going to the beach!

17:04.940 --> 17:06.000
Ladies, watch your backs.

17:06.010 --> 17:07.069
That looks heavy.

17:07.079 --> 17:08.770
<i>(Sterling)</i> <i>Ooh, lord.</i>

17:08.780 --> 17:10.900
On to the beach, chauffeur.

17:10.910 --> 17:12.740
<i>Have fun, ladies!</i>

17:12.750 --> 17:14.740
[All cheering] [Horn honks]

17:14.750 --> 17:16.079
God, this [Bleep]'s heavy.

17:16.089 --> 17:17.619
I'm out of breath.

17:20.060 --> 17:21.490
[Bleep].

17:23.030 --> 17:26.790
[All cheering]

17:26.800 --> 17:28.220
I'm flipping out right now.

17:28.230 --> 17:30.260
We're all [Bleep]. Everybody's going nuts.

17:30.270 --> 17:31.620
Whoo!

17:31.630 --> 17:33.330
Santa Monica, bitches.

17:33.340 --> 17:34.430
<i>(Sterling)</i> <i>We here, baby!</i>

17:34.440 --> 17:35.890
[All cheering]

17:35.900 --> 17:37.900
Let's go, blue. Have a good time today!

17:37.910 --> 17:39.730
<i>Man, that pool look good.</i>

17:39.740 --> 17:41.970
Whoo!

17:41.980 --> 17:43.770
Hey, guys. How you guys doing?

17:43.780 --> 17:46.240
I'm Genai Kerr, U.S. water polo olympian.

17:46.250 --> 17:47.240
- Wow.
- Nice to meet you.

17:47.250 --> 17:48.570
Look at that gold medal.

17:48.580 --> 17:50.110
I have a little treat for you guys here.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.610
This is U.S. olympian Shea Buckner.

17:52.620 --> 17:53.990
<i>(Aaron)</i> <i>Oh, my God.</i>

17:55.090 --> 17:56.280
This is another U.S. olympian

17:56.290 --> 17:57.950
and gold medalist, Tumua Anae.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.820
(Aaron) I am not nearly as fit

17:59.830 --> 18:01.390
as these olympians standing in front of me.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.490
- <i>Nice to meet you.</i>
- Nice to meet you guys.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.290
I mean, this chunky white
kid don't get in a speedo.

18:06.300 --> 18:08.460
Hey, if I drown, can she
give me mouth-to-mouth?

18:08.470 --> 18:09.700
[Laughter]

18:09.710 --> 18:11.360
Just so you know, in
the sport of water polo,

18:11.370 --> 18:13.030
everything's legal under the water.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.530
So we'll leave it at that.

18:15.540 --> 18:16.840
Holy [Bleep]!

18:19.980 --> 18:22.780
Whoo!

18:22.790 --> 18:24.980
(Andi) Okay, guys, so
basically what you're gonna do

18:24.990 --> 18:26.710
is score all the tomatoes, slice shallots.

18:26.720 --> 18:27.980
We need to smash garlic.

18:27.990 --> 18:29.980
We're gonna hand-grate all the cheese.

18:29.990 --> 18:31.280
It goes on and on.

18:31.290 --> 18:32.790
This is a lot of tedious [Bleep].

18:32.800 --> 18:34.720
It's like my biceps are
gonna be ripped today.

18:34.730 --> 18:36.360
Right?

18:36.370 --> 18:38.390
(Narrator) While the women
get a serious workout

18:38.400 --> 18:40.060
in the kitchen, the men...

18:40.070 --> 18:41.430
(Genai) Are you guys ready?

18:41.440 --> 18:45.230
(Narrator) Get an olympic
workout in the pool.

18:45.240 --> 18:48.670
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

18:48.680 --> 18:50.400
Oh, [Bleep].

18:50.410 --> 18:51.700
This is work.

18:51.710 --> 18:53.610
[Laughter]

18:53.620 --> 18:57.140
<i>He stole the ball.</i>

18:57.150 --> 18:58.580
[Gurgling]

18:58.590 --> 19:00.350
"Now I gotta get to the yellow"...

19:00.360 --> 19:01.950
I'm sitting there trying to tread water.

19:01.960 --> 19:03.120
You know what that looks like?

19:03.130 --> 19:04.220
That looks like a cat

19:04.230 --> 19:05.650
trying to get out of the [Bleep] bathtub.

19:05.660 --> 19:07.190
[Cat yowls]

19:07.200 --> 19:09.120
I can't move!

19:09.130 --> 19:11.520
<i>Come here.</i>

19:11.530 --> 19:13.630
Protein challenge, protein shakes.

19:13.640 --> 19:14.830
<i>Yeah, guys?</i>

19:14.840 --> 19:16.430
(All) Yes, Chef.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.830
These are all your ingredients.

19:17.840 --> 19:21.870
<i>So we have scallops,
hard-boiled eggs, anchovies,</i>

19:21.880 --> 19:23.800
<i>boiled chicken.</i>

19:23.810 --> 19:24.940
[Groans]

19:24.950 --> 19:27.440
Oh, a milkshake, how awesome.

19:27.450 --> 19:30.440
No. No [Bleep] way.

19:30.450 --> 19:31.810
(Andi) All right, guys, enjoy.

19:31.820 --> 19:33.210
Uh-uh.

19:33.220 --> 19:34.750
Ooh.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.420
I want nothing to do with this,

19:36.430 --> 19:38.420
but let's just get it over with.

19:38.430 --> 19:40.790
I'm going in.

19:43.570 --> 19:45.120
[Groans]

19:45.130 --> 19:46.990
Dude, that's disgusting.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.360
<i>Keep going.</i> <i>Yes, Kalen, go ahead.</i>

19:48.370 --> 19:49.830
<i>Go, chug.</i> <i>Chug, chug.</i>

19:49.840 --> 19:51.260
Go, Kalen! There you go, Kalen.

19:51.270 --> 19:53.670
- Yeah, girl!
- There you go, there you go.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.570
It's like I licked a fish tank.

19:55.580 --> 19:57.800
It does something funny
once it's in there, though.

19:57.810 --> 19:59.000
I'll tell you that.

19:59.010 --> 20:00.710
There's, like, [Bleep] pieces of anchovy

20:00.720 --> 20:02.070
floating around and [Bleep].

20:02.080 --> 20:04.510
Talking about it is not
gonna make it any better.

20:04.520 --> 20:07.450
Shut up. Stop [Bleep] saying
what's in the [Bleep] drink.

20:07.460 --> 20:08.480
[Bleep] drink up.

20:08.490 --> 20:09.680
(Jennifer) I'm trying to drink.

20:09.690 --> 20:11.520
You just gotta just think it's like beer.

20:11.530 --> 20:14.150
Whoa. <i>Oh, one down.</i>

20:14.160 --> 20:15.320
<i>Ugh.</i>

20:15.330 --> 20:17.920
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

20:17.930 --> 20:19.220
No, no.

20:19.230 --> 20:21.230
[Shouts]

20:21.240 --> 20:23.230
Everyone is finishing their shake,

20:23.240 --> 20:25.330
but here is little miss Jennifer

20:25.340 --> 20:27.400
that thinks she's just gonna take a sip,

20:27.410 --> 20:28.400
throw it up.

20:28.410 --> 20:30.100
No, this is a team effort.

20:30.110 --> 20:32.570
You [Bleep] up, just like everyone else.

20:32.580 --> 20:34.810
Drink your shake, and be happy with it.

20:34.820 --> 20:35.810
Come on, Jen.

20:35.820 --> 20:37.110
(Jennifer) Shut the [Bleep] up.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.040
You're not even halfway
done. Just keep it going.

20:39.050 --> 20:40.210
(Sade) Oh, yeah, [Bleep] you too.

20:40.220 --> 20:41.510
Play nice.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.520
My niceness is about to be
tossed across the [Bleep] table.

20:43.530 --> 20:44.920
What exactly are we tossing?

20:44.930 --> 20:47.690
(Jennifer) [Bleep] punch to the face.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.910
(Narrator) After losing
this morning's challenge

20:58.920 --> 21:01.350
and having to endure a
stomach-churning lunch,

21:01.360 --> 21:04.280
you just gotta just think it's like beer.

21:04.290 --> 21:06.050
- <i>Whoa, there she goes.</i>
- <i>Oh, one down.</i>

21:06.060 --> 21:08.620
(Narrator) Tensions on the red
team are at an all-time high.

21:08.630 --> 21:11.190
My niceness is about to be
tossed across the [Bleep] table.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.590
What exactly are we tossing?

21:12.600 --> 21:14.890
(Jennifer) [Bleep] punch to the face.

21:14.900 --> 21:15.890
You guys...

21:15.900 --> 21:17.200
that's just a bad attitude.

21:17.210 --> 21:20.360
I'm not gonna let her run
her [Bleep] mouth to me.

21:20.370 --> 21:22.870
I'm a sassy individual.
This is just who I am.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.070
Take it or leave it.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.940
(La Tasha) Make it positive, ladies.

21:25.950 --> 21:28.840
By all means.

21:28.850 --> 21:30.210
[Whoops]

21:30.220 --> 21:31.410
Boys are back.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.610
- Yeah, come on, guys.
- Oh, yeah.

21:33.620 --> 21:35.610
Should I be impressed? 'Cause I'm not.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.620
[Laughs] Look at Frank!

21:37.630 --> 21:38.720
Goofball.

21:38.730 --> 21:40.750
Beautiful work. Keep it going.

21:40.760 --> 21:43.550
Excuse me.

21:43.560 --> 21:46.620
- Whoo!
- Nice.

21:46.630 --> 21:49.660
(Narrator) While the men get
back to business in the kitchen,

21:49.670 --> 21:51.900
Jennifer and Sade still have

21:51.910 --> 21:53.400
a few personal matters to sort out.

21:53.410 --> 21:54.770
(Sade) This is the thing. We're a team.

21:54.780 --> 21:56.570
You do not have to disrespect
me because you're upset.

21:56.580 --> 21:57.900
I'm not even gonna lie.

21:57.910 --> 21:59.000
This is my attitude, and
that's how I am in the kitchen.

21:59.010 --> 22:00.440
<i>And I understand...</i>

22:00.450 --> 22:02.640
I don't feel like I should
have to apologize for [Bleep].

22:02.650 --> 22:03.770
I don't like Sade.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.010
I'm not here to rub your back.

22:05.020 --> 22:06.440
I'm here to win. This is the bottom line.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.580
Like, [Bleep] you.

22:07.590 --> 22:08.580
If you don't want me to disrespect you,

22:08.590 --> 22:09.910
don't disrespect me.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.250
<i>I've been nothing</i> <i>but nice and courteous</i>

22:11.260 --> 22:12.480
<i>to you this whole time,
and I thought we were cool.</i>

22:12.490 --> 22:14.790
But for you to do all of that [Bleep] me

22:14.800 --> 22:16.750
and you're gonna...
like, don't threaten me.

22:16.760 --> 22:17.890
I'm not threatening you.

22:17.900 --> 22:19.060
If I was threatening you,

22:19.070 --> 22:20.190
you would know that I was threatening you.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.530
See, but then that sounds like a threat,

22:21.540 --> 22:22.630
and now I feel some type of way.

22:22.640 --> 22:23.960
You don't have to talk to me like that.

22:23.970 --> 22:25.160
<i>I would appreciate it</i>

22:25.170 --> 22:26.860
<i>if you respect me</i> <i>as I respect you.</i>

22:26.870 --> 22:28.030
That's all I'm saying.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.700
- Okay? All right.
- Yeah.

22:29.710 --> 22:31.670
It's always, "[Bleep]
this," and, "bitch this,"

22:31.680 --> 22:32.970
and, "ooh," and, "uh."

22:32.980 --> 22:34.310
Relax. Seriously.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.870
Take the testosterone
level down a little bit.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.380
We are adults.

22:38.390 --> 22:40.410
We can address this issue
and not make it a big thing.

22:40.420 --> 22:41.710
(La Tasha) We're gonna rock out.

22:41.720 --> 22:42.710
Gonna kill this.

22:42.720 --> 22:45.880
Family night.

22:45.890 --> 22:47.250
More chicken parm here.

22:47.260 --> 22:48.950
Man, can I say something to y'all, man?

22:48.960 --> 22:50.090
I love today, man.

22:50.100 --> 22:51.620
Can we just keep that energy, man?

22:51.630 --> 22:53.920
Felt good to get that
water with y'all, man.

22:53.930 --> 22:56.290
I think tonight, I want
to make a big statement

22:56.300 --> 22:59.460
and show Mr. 100 is in this kitchen.

22:59.470 --> 23:00.770
Whoo.

23:02.210 --> 23:03.400
(Gordon) Ladies, let's go.

23:03.410 --> 23:04.600
(All) Yes, Chef.

23:04.610 --> 23:06.340
<i>(Gordon)</i> <i>Gentlemen, line up,</i> <i>please.</i>

23:06.350 --> 23:07.540
[Sighs]

23:07.550 --> 23:09.740
Gentlemen, good start today.

23:09.750 --> 23:13.380
Let's see if you can
make it happen in dinner.

23:13.390 --> 23:14.780
Tonight is family night.

23:14.790 --> 23:17.050
<i>This dinner service
should not only be great,</i>

23:17.060 --> 23:18.920
<i>but quick as well.</i>

23:18.930 --> 23:22.620
I expect every family to leave
this unique evening happy.

23:22.630 --> 23:26.460
I do not want to disappoint
a single child, clear?

23:26.470 --> 23:27.770
- (All) Yes, Chef.
- <i>Good.</i>

23:29.800 --> 23:31.800
- Let's go.
- (All) Yes, Chef.

23:33.470 --> 23:34.900
- Marino.
- Yes, Chef?

23:34.910 --> 23:36.500
Tonight is a very special night.

23:36.510 --> 23:37.770
- <i>Yes, Chef.</i>
- Please open.

23:37.780 --> 23:39.000
Hell's Kitchen family night. Let's go.

23:39.010 --> 23:40.780
Yes, Chef.

23:45.650 --> 23:47.580
Let's go, ladies, let's
go, let's go, let's go.

23:47.590 --> 23:49.880
(James) Beautiful pizza, guys,
like that all night long.

23:49.890 --> 23:50.880
Yes, Chef.

23:50.890 --> 23:52.980
- I'm here for you.
- Thanks.

23:52.990 --> 23:54.750
It's so beautiful.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.590
I was not expecting this. Me neither.

23:56.600 --> 23:57.760
(Narrator) It's family night,

23:57.770 --> 23:58.920
and Hell's Kitchen is filled

23:58.930 --> 24:01.360
with some of its most demanding diners.

24:01.370 --> 24:02.860
[Baby cries]

24:02.870 --> 24:04.930
And in addition to his classic menu...

24:04.940 --> 24:07.130
I'll have the scallops then, please.

24:07.140 --> 24:10.230
Chef Ramsay has added a pizza
station for the children,

24:10.240 --> 24:13.740
manned by Santos and
Fernando for the blue team

24:13.750 --> 24:15.810
and Ashley and Jennifer for the red.

24:15.820 --> 24:17.110
- Good evening, Chef.
- Family night.

24:17.120 --> 24:18.310
It's like sonar. What's the matter?

24:18.320 --> 24:20.180
It's a two-top, right? Okay, good.

24:20.190 --> 24:22.110
On order, four covers, table 30, yes?

24:22.120 --> 24:24.180
One caesar salad, on
capellini, one risotto?

24:24.190 --> 24:26.420
- Yes, heard, Chef.
- Thank you. Let's go.

24:26.430 --> 24:27.750
You want me to start this for you?

24:27.760 --> 24:28.890
Yeah, if you want.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.920
The hot app station is my bitch tonight.

24:30.930 --> 24:32.320
That's still too under.

24:32.330 --> 24:35.530
Katie's helping me out to
get started on hot apps...

24:35.540 --> 24:36.530
<i>(Katie)</i> <i>No, you're good.</i>

24:36.540 --> 24:37.960
That's ready too.

24:37.970 --> 24:41.170
Which is great, because I really
want the girls to win tonight.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.630
Risotto walking in one minute!

24:42.640 --> 24:44.340
(Sade) I got your lobster down.

24:44.350 --> 24:46.270
(Gordon) Where's the capellini? Risotto?

24:46.280 --> 24:47.870
- Risotto walking.
- Hot, Chef.

24:47.880 --> 24:48.870
Where's the lobster?

24:48.880 --> 24:49.910
Coming right now.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.340
Capellini walking right behind you, Chef.

24:51.350 --> 24:52.640
<i>(Gordon)</i> <i>Let's go.</i>

24:52.650 --> 24:53.940
- Lobster.
- Right behind, Chef.

24:53.950 --> 24:55.710
Right here, Chef.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.920
That's cooked to [Bleep].

24:58.930 --> 24:59.980
How you looking, Tash?

24:59.990 --> 25:01.320
I'm looking good, looking good.

25:01.330 --> 25:02.920
Hey, red team.

25:02.930 --> 25:04.720
Who just shouted, "looking good"?

25:04.730 --> 25:06.090
Come here, all of you.

25:06.100 --> 25:07.730
Let me show you something
that's looking [Bleep].

25:07.740 --> 25:08.990
That's you, ignorant lady!

25:09.000 --> 25:10.690
Sorry, Chef. <i>Well,</i> <i>look at that.</i>

25:10.700 --> 25:13.230
What in the [Bleep] is that?

25:13.240 --> 25:15.200
- Anybody?
- A dry capellini, Chef.

25:15.210 --> 25:17.670
Kalen, you brought that capellini to Chef?

25:17.680 --> 25:19.000
Are you insane?

25:19.010 --> 25:20.670
That looks like something
that's been left over

25:20.680 --> 25:21.670
in [Bleep] pot wash.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.210
- <i>Start again.</i>
- <i>Yes, Chef.</i>

25:23.220 --> 25:24.910
One more capellini. Come on, guys.

25:24.920 --> 25:26.380
Refire, right? Let's go.

25:26.390 --> 25:28.350
Maybe you just fired it too quick?

25:28.360 --> 25:29.350
(Kalen) Yeah.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.250
Katie just screwed me hard-core.

25:31.260 --> 25:32.650
What the hell?

25:32.660 --> 25:34.850
Keep pushing, keep pushing, ladies.

25:34.860 --> 25:37.820
(Narrator) While Kalen refires the
first ticket in the red kitchen,

25:37.830 --> 25:38.820
over in the blue kitchen...

25:38.830 --> 25:40.060
On order, four covers, table 14.

25:40.070 --> 25:42.230
And away, one fire, one
scallops, one risotto.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.690
Yes, Chef.

25:43.700 --> 25:46.060
(Narrator) Sterling, on
appetizers, and Aaron, on fish,

25:46.070 --> 25:47.930
hurry to get out their first ticket.

25:47.940 --> 25:49.200
- Three minutes. Let's go!
- <i>Yes, Chef.</i>

25:49.210 --> 25:51.140
(Narrator) But in the dining room...

25:51.150 --> 25:52.200
I'm Santos.

25:52.210 --> 25:54.640
I'm gonna make your pizza for you, okay?

25:54.650 --> 25:57.780
(Narrator) Santos is taking a
somewhat more hands-off approach.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.910
<i>(Santos)</i> <i>You want to put</i> <i>the parmesan on?</i>

25:59.920 --> 26:01.210
<i>Yeah?</i> <i>All right.</i>

26:01.220 --> 26:04.480
There you go. Now, shake it.

26:04.490 --> 26:05.650
Great job.

26:05.660 --> 26:07.690
What the [Bleep] are
those two doing out there?

26:07.700 --> 26:09.590
Sterling, go and tell Fernando and Santos

26:09.600 --> 26:10.590
to hurry up, please.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.560
Hey, hey, gently, yes?

26:12.570 --> 26:14.430
- Hurry up. Let's go.
- Yes, Chef.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.390
Chef's saying let's hurry up, sir.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.060
Yeah. The kids are taking a long time.

26:18.070 --> 26:19.430
And we don't want them to feel rushed.

26:19.440 --> 26:20.970
We want them to have fun with it, but...

26:20.980 --> 26:22.730
Come on, Santos. Speed it up.

26:22.740 --> 26:24.100
One risotto, one scallops.

26:24.110 --> 26:25.840
Just under two minutes to the window, yes?

26:25.850 --> 26:27.440
Two minutes. Yes, Chef. You're driving it.

26:27.450 --> 26:29.040
- Yes, Chef, I am!
- <i>I want to hear you, then.</i>

26:29.050 --> 26:30.840
- Yes, Chef!
- Two minutes to the window.

26:30.850 --> 26:31.910
Two minutes to the window.

26:31.920 --> 26:33.040
Thank you, sir.

26:33.050 --> 26:35.080
Kick back and relax, and enjoy this show,

26:35.090 --> 26:37.790
'cause Mr. 100's about
to give it to you, baby.

26:39.330 --> 26:40.550
Sterling, scallops, risotto.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.950
- You ready, scallops?
- <i>No.</i>

26:41.960 --> 26:43.250
What?

26:43.260 --> 26:44.720
I'm not gonna be ready for three minutes.

26:44.730 --> 26:45.760
Three minutes?

26:45.770 --> 26:47.420
Come on, get the pan on the [Bleep] stove.

26:47.430 --> 26:49.490
Let the pan work with you, yeah?

26:49.500 --> 26:51.500
Yes, Chef. 30 seconds, out.

26:51.510 --> 26:52.900
Aaron, pull your [Bleep] together.

26:52.910 --> 26:54.570
You got Chef Ramsay [Bleep] teaching you

26:54.580 --> 26:55.970
how to [Bleep] cook.

26:55.980 --> 26:58.500
- Speed, speed, speed.
- Speed, Chef.

26:58.510 --> 26:59.800
<i>(Sterling)</i> <i>30 seconds, I'm ready.</i>

26:59.810 --> 27:01.010
Sir, you walking with scallops?

27:01.020 --> 27:02.610
Walking with scallops.
<i>Risotto in the window.</i>

27:02.620 --> 27:04.050
<i>Behind.</i>

27:07.660 --> 27:10.310
Service, please. Table 12, let's go.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.120
(Narrator) With a little
help from Chef Ramsay,

27:12.130 --> 27:14.050
Aaron's scallops are acceptable,

27:14.060 --> 27:16.690
and the blue team is off to a
good start in the kitchen...

27:16.700 --> 27:17.720
Come on, guys.

27:17.730 --> 27:19.160
(Narrator) And in the dining room.

27:19.170 --> 27:20.590
This is good pizza, mommy.

27:20.600 --> 27:21.990
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.060
(Narrator) Meanwhile,
back in the red kitchen...

27:24.070 --> 27:25.700
- How long, Kalen?
- Five minutes, Chef.

27:25.710 --> 27:27.100
Why?

27:27.110 --> 27:28.900
(Narrator) Kalen is still
working on her refire

27:28.910 --> 27:30.430
of their first appetizer.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.640
Hurry up. Four minutes I want it.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.470
- Let's go.
- Yes, Chef, absolutely.

27:33.480 --> 27:36.040
I am not going to let my station go down.

27:36.050 --> 27:37.270
I've got this [Bleep].

27:37.280 --> 27:39.180
How long on that risotto capellini?

27:39.190 --> 27:41.910
- Pasta's working hard.
- Work it harder. Everything's gonna die.

27:41.920 --> 27:42.980
<i>I am working hard, guys!</i>

27:42.990 --> 27:45.380
I can't make the pasta cook any faster.

27:45.390 --> 27:46.550
It's two minutes.

27:46.560 --> 27:48.820
I don't know why everyone is freaking out.

27:48.830 --> 27:50.520
You know, in my brain,
everything's going pretty well.

27:50.530 --> 27:51.990
Why am I waiting for pasta?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.120
How long on that pasta?

27:53.130 --> 27:55.190
Eh?

27:55.200 --> 27:57.600
There's 100 guests
waiting to be [Bleep] fed.

27:57.610 --> 27:58.830
<i>Nothing's coming out.</i>

27:58.840 --> 28:00.400
Get her going over there.

28:00.410 --> 28:02.770
- Come on, let's go!
- Working hard, Chef. Working hard.

28:02.780 --> 28:04.170
- Come on!
- Coming.

28:04.180 --> 28:06.170
Well, where is it? Pull it together.

28:06.180 --> 28:07.350
<i>Move!</i>

28:13.650 --> 28:15.810
(Narrator) It's an hour
into dinner service.

28:15.820 --> 28:17.480
Why am I waiting for pasta?

28:17.490 --> 28:20.550
(Narrator) And Kalen's sluggish
performance on capellini and risotto

28:20.560 --> 28:22.580
has the red team stuck in neutral.

28:22.590 --> 28:24.990
There's 100 guests
waiting to be [Bleep] fed.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.420
<i>Nothing's coming out.</i>

28:26.430 --> 28:28.690
(Narrator) And Chef Ramsay
is thoroughly frustrated.

28:28.700 --> 28:31.290
- Come on!
- Working hard, Chef. Working hard.

28:31.300 --> 28:32.430
Can somebody help Kalen?

28:32.440 --> 28:33.860
Yes, Chef!

28:33.870 --> 28:36.200
Kalen is overwhelmed again.

28:36.210 --> 28:37.870
So you gonna finish capellini.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.500
- I'm gonna finish risotto, okay?
- Okay. Okay.

28:39.510 --> 28:42.240
(Sade) Nice, saucy
capellini. Come on, ladies.

28:42.250 --> 28:43.870
Yes! How's this, baby?

28:43.880 --> 28:45.510
That looks a lot better.

28:45.520 --> 28:47.680
- <i>You got lobster?</i>
- Go on lobster.

28:47.690 --> 28:49.740
I'm coming over hot! Coming around hot.

28:49.750 --> 28:51.410
(Sade) Come on, guys. Risotto down, Chef.

28:51.420 --> 28:52.450
<i>Risotto's</i> <i>in the pass.</i>

28:52.460 --> 28:53.580
I'm back on meat.

28:53.590 --> 28:55.020
- Lobster.
- Give me that capellini.

28:55.030 --> 28:58.220
- Let's go!
- Right now, walking.

28:58.230 --> 29:00.230
On your right. On your right, Chef.

29:02.530 --> 29:04.190
- Service, please.
- Come on, Kalen.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.890
- <i>Keep it up.</i> <i>Keep it up.</i> 
- <i>Go, please.</i>

29:05.900 --> 29:07.830
(Narrator) Kalen finally
delivers appetizers

29:07.840 --> 29:09.800
that meet Chef Ramsay's approval.

29:09.810 --> 29:10.970
Let's go.

29:10.980 --> 29:12.230
(Narrator) And diners on the red side...

29:12.240 --> 29:13.830
<i>How is it?</i> <i>Is it good?</i>

29:13.840 --> 29:16.140
(Narrator) Are satisfied
with what they're receiving.

29:16.150 --> 29:18.110
Meanwhile, back in the blue kitchen...

29:18.120 --> 29:20.270
Scallops and risotto, how long?

29:20.280 --> 29:21.710
30 seconds, Chef!

29:21.720 --> 29:23.640
(Narrator) It's up to
Aaron on the fish station

29:23.650 --> 29:25.010
to complete the last order of appetizers.

29:25.020 --> 29:27.850
- Walking with scallops.
- Walking now.

29:27.860 --> 29:29.350
Risotto in the window.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.930
Chef, scallops behind.

29:33.730 --> 29:36.590
(Gordon) This is a joke.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.090
- Blue team.
- <i>Yes, Chef.</i>

29:38.100 --> 29:40.660
All of you, come here.

29:40.670 --> 29:42.700
Just touch that.

29:42.710 --> 29:43.860
<i>That's raw, man.</i>

29:43.870 --> 29:45.170
Raw, Chef.

29:45.180 --> 29:46.970
- Fire one more scallop.
- Yes, Chef.

29:46.980 --> 29:48.100
<i>Come on, Aaron.</i>

29:48.110 --> 29:50.810
Hey, I turn my back, and they're raw.

29:50.820 --> 29:52.240
- How?
- I...

29:52.250 --> 29:53.570
I deserve an answer!

29:53.580 --> 29:56.680
I wish I could give you an answer, Chef.

29:56.690 --> 29:58.480
- Aaron, just bounce back.
- All day, every day.

29:58.490 --> 29:59.810
We all got to calm down, you know?

29:59.820 --> 30:02.220
Just relax. [Exhales]

30:02.230 --> 30:03.320
Come on, Aaron!

30:03.330 --> 30:04.850
Here, here. Walk!

30:04.860 --> 30:06.500
- Come on!
- Scallops, Chef!

30:08.570 --> 30:09.820
Table two, Jean.

30:09.830 --> 30:11.690
Nice work, guys. Nice work.

30:11.700 --> 30:14.660
See, I cook an amazing [Bleep] scallop.

30:14.670 --> 30:17.500
(Narrator) With Aaron's
successful refire on the scallops,

30:17.510 --> 30:19.900
the men are ready to move on to entrees,

30:19.910 --> 30:21.100
with Bryant on meat

30:21.110 --> 30:22.570
and Steve on the garnish station.

30:22.580 --> 30:23.900
Away now, three New York strip,

30:23.910 --> 30:25.070
one salmon, one chicken,

30:25.080 --> 30:26.710
- five minutes to window.
- You got it.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.910
- Four minutes to garnish!
- Four minutes for garnish, Chef.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.040
Guys, let's work together.

30:30.050 --> 30:32.250
<i>Let's go.</i>

30:32.260 --> 30:33.910
(Narrator) Back in the red kitchen...

30:33.920 --> 30:35.820
On order, four covers, table 43.

30:35.830 --> 30:37.590
Away, two scallops, two risotto, fire.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.120
Two risotto, two scallops.

30:39.130 --> 30:42.120
(Narrator) Kalen on
appetizers and Sade on fish

30:42.130 --> 30:43.720
seem to have found their groove.

30:43.730 --> 30:46.360
I've got three minutes
on that risotto. Heard.

30:46.370 --> 30:47.530
Everybody good?

30:47.540 --> 30:49.400
When fish and hot apps work together

30:49.410 --> 30:51.400
like Sade and I are working,

30:51.410 --> 30:52.430
it is a gorgeous thing.

30:52.440 --> 30:53.800
Risotto, how you looking?

30:53.810 --> 30:56.270
- A minute?
- Dropping scallops now.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.940
- I'm not ready, baby.
- You just said you were.

30:58.950 --> 31:01.940
I need... I need another minute and a half.

31:01.950 --> 31:03.510
You're [Bleep] confusing me right now.

31:03.520 --> 31:04.510
Make your mind.

31:04.520 --> 31:06.050
Table 53, Chef.

31:06.060 --> 31:08.150
(Andi) How long on two
scallops, two risotto?

31:08.160 --> 31:09.480
I'm hoping in one minute.

31:09.490 --> 31:10.580
- One minute, yes.
- All right, let's go.

31:10.590 --> 31:14.120
Kalen, come on. You suck so bad.

31:14.130 --> 31:15.290
Kalen, come on. Let's go!

31:15.300 --> 31:17.360
Two scallop right here. Right here, Chef.

31:17.370 --> 31:19.660
- Nice scallops. Let's go.
- Thank you, Chef.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.230
- Risotto!
- Risotto walking.

31:21.240 --> 31:23.230
- You got the lobster, babe?
- Yeah, I got it.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.500
- On your right, Chef.
- Yeah, come on.

31:25.510 --> 31:26.500
Lobster.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.010
Right here, Chef.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.670
Here we go, yeah? Table 50, yes?

31:31.680 --> 31:34.140
Let's go, Jean, please.

31:34.150 --> 31:36.640
Away now, two chicken, one
salmon, one New York strip.

31:36.650 --> 31:37.780
I'm three out!

31:37.790 --> 31:39.250
(Narrator) With the first entree order in,

31:39.260 --> 31:41.920
it's up to la Tasha on
meat, Roe on garnish,

31:41.930 --> 31:44.620
and Sade on fish to make up for lost time.

31:44.630 --> 31:46.090
Well, now we're moving. Simmer down.

31:46.100 --> 31:47.090
Got some action now.

31:47.100 --> 31:48.620
Keep pushing, ladies.

31:48.630 --> 31:50.190
(Narrator) In the blue kitchen...

31:50.200 --> 31:52.490
Where's the New York
strip? Salmon, chicken?

31:52.500 --> 31:53.530
I'm ready to go!

31:53.540 --> 31:54.960
Go, coming down the line.

31:54.970 --> 31:56.230
Walking to the window with all garnish.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.070
Chicken, New York strip. Let's go.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.330
- Bryant, that's cooked beautifully, that steak.
- <i>Thank you, Chef.</i>

32:00.340 --> 32:03.070
(Narrator) Bryant is proving
he can handle the meat station.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.510
One salmon. Behind, Chef.

32:04.520 --> 32:05.840
- Steve.
- Behind you.

32:05.850 --> 32:07.710
(Narrator) And the rest of
the team is keeping pace.

32:07.720 --> 32:08.740
Go, please.

32:08.750 --> 32:10.010
Hey, the temperatures are perfect.

32:10.020 --> 32:12.210
- Drive the table.
- Yes, Chef, I will.

32:12.220 --> 32:13.480
We're killing it.

32:13.490 --> 32:14.680
We're sending out tickets
one after another.

32:14.690 --> 32:16.080
Go, please. Thank you.

32:16.090 --> 32:17.820
Rolling, rolling,
rolling, rolling, nonstop.

32:17.830 --> 32:19.550
Go, please. Marino, come on, please, buddy.

32:19.560 --> 32:20.550
Last ticket, two-top.

32:20.560 --> 32:22.460
[Bleep] hell. Sleeping tonight.

32:22.470 --> 32:23.860
On order, two covers, table 24.

32:23.870 --> 32:25.330
One branzino, one New York strip.

32:25.340 --> 32:26.460
- How long?
- Three minutes, Chef.

32:26.470 --> 32:27.460
Three minutes. Let's go.

32:27.470 --> 32:28.600
(All) Yes, Chef.

32:28.610 --> 32:30.000
(Narrator) The men are one ticket away

32:30.010 --> 32:31.430
from completing dinner service.

32:31.440 --> 32:32.830
Last ticket, guys.

32:32.840 --> 32:34.670
(Narrator) Meanwhile,
back in the red kitchen...

32:34.680 --> 32:37.070
Branzino and salmon
garnish. You can go on that.

32:37.080 --> 32:40.070
(Narrator) Sade on fish is doing her
part to keep the entrees flowing.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.480
- Can I walk this?
- Yes, baby. You're up there.

32:42.490 --> 32:44.550
- I'm ready.
- Go, go. Where's the garnish?

32:44.560 --> 32:46.810
What? Salmon and branzino.

32:46.820 --> 32:48.950
(Narrator) But Roe on garnish
can't seem to keep up.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.480
Beside. You said you had it.

32:50.490 --> 32:53.920
It is frustrating to have all
of my proteins cooked perfectly,

32:53.930 --> 32:55.120
ready to go up,

32:55.130 --> 32:57.190
and I do not have
cauliflower that is ready.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.090
It's extremely irritating.

32:59.100 --> 33:00.330
Where's the cauliflower?

33:00.340 --> 33:01.900
I can't walk the protein
before the garnish.

33:01.910 --> 33:03.200
Come on. You got that?

33:03.210 --> 33:05.000
(Roe) You're not the
only one I'm firing for.

33:05.010 --> 33:07.030
Bitch, are you serious? Please.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.940
Red team, what did I say at
the beginning of service?

33:08.950 --> 33:11.370
- Quick service, Chef.
- Hey, all of you, come here.

33:11.380 --> 33:13.740
<i>All of you.</i>

33:13.750 --> 33:16.310
One, two, three, four, five, yeah?

33:16.320 --> 33:18.210
And one ticket left in the blue.

33:18.220 --> 33:19.780
Yes, Chef! Heard, Chef!

33:19.790 --> 33:21.250
<i>(Gordon)</i> <i>We're just</i> <i>destroying ourselves.</i>

33:21.260 --> 33:22.720
So lackadaisical.

33:22.730 --> 33:25.690
Chef Ramsay says that we're lackadaisical.

33:25.700 --> 33:27.920
As soon as I find out what that means,

33:27.930 --> 33:30.490
I'm gonna make sure that
I'm never that way again.

33:30.500 --> 33:31.890
I'm walking New York.

33:31.900 --> 33:33.760
Two salmon, one branzino. Strip is coming.

33:33.770 --> 33:34.930
New York in the pass.

33:34.940 --> 33:36.830
Cauliflower in my hand. Oh, dear.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.370
Dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

33:38.380 --> 33:40.530
Where's the fries? Fries?

33:40.540 --> 33:43.470
Where's the fries? [Bleep].

33:43.480 --> 33:45.640
Roe! Three times, where's the fries?

33:45.650 --> 33:47.510
Three times. Heard, Chef, right now.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.310
I know you heard, but
I just want an answer,

33:49.320 --> 33:51.010
or don't you think I deserve one?

33:51.020 --> 33:53.610
Roe is [Bleep] garnish, for God's sakes.

33:53.620 --> 33:56.120
Garnish should be first, Roe.
Every table's been behind.

33:56.130 --> 33:57.820
Yes, Chef. You're not
bothered about the execution.

33:57.830 --> 33:59.220
I am. I am bothered, Chef.

33:59.230 --> 34:00.450
<i>Come on, then!</i>

34:00.460 --> 34:02.030
What the [Bleep] is going on?

34:08.179 --> 34:09.639
(Narrator) It's just over two hours

34:09.650 --> 34:11.840
into Hell's Kitchen's family night,

34:11.850 --> 34:14.909
and diners on the blue side
are already enjoying dessert.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.239
Sure does look good. Think I can have some?

34:17.250 --> 34:19.409
(Narrator) While some
diners on the red side...

34:19.420 --> 34:20.780
Mommy's hungry.

34:20.790 --> 34:22.719
(Narrator) Are getting
irritated about the wait.

34:22.730 --> 34:24.219
(Gordon) Red team. Yes, Chef?

34:24.230 --> 34:26.719
Slow. Every table's been behind.

34:26.730 --> 34:28.620
Yes, Chef. You're not
bothered about the execution.

34:28.630 --> 34:29.960
- I am.
- I am bothered, Chef.

34:29.969 --> 34:31.460
Come on, then!

34:31.469 --> 34:33.290
(Kalen) Roe's over here and
can't even butter greens.

34:33.300 --> 34:34.659
Oh, my God.

34:34.670 --> 34:35.699
Come on, switch your stuff out.

34:35.710 --> 34:37.100
How long? Yo, I'm ready, Tash.

34:37.110 --> 34:38.770
I'm ready. Walk, walk, walk.

34:38.780 --> 34:40.300
Behind, hot. Chef, greens.

34:40.310 --> 34:41.739
Salmon, Chef.

34:41.750 --> 34:43.300
- Coming over hot.
- <i>Go, please.</i>

34:43.310 --> 34:44.699
(Roe) I'm walking. Are you ready, branzino?

34:44.710 --> 34:46.469
- Walk it.
- Chicken walking, Chef.

34:46.480 --> 34:48.239
- <i>Go, please.</i>
- Coming over hot.

34:48.250 --> 34:51.510
(Narrator) Finally the red team
delivers their last entrees...

34:51.520 --> 34:52.510
It's good.

34:52.520 --> 34:53.850
(Narrator) To their very hungry

34:53.860 --> 34:56.120
and very grateful diners.

34:56.130 --> 34:57.360
[Laughs]

34:59.260 --> 35:01.220
Tonight's service was a lot harder

35:01.230 --> 35:04.220
than I thought it was gonna be.

35:04.230 --> 35:05.830
<i>Roe was fast asleep</i> <i>tonight.</i>

35:05.840 --> 35:08.430
Garnish needs to go first.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.960
Kalen, it's like you're cooking like

35:09.970 --> 35:11.500
you're stuck in first gear.

35:11.510 --> 35:13.000
- <i>Were you okay?</i>
- Yes, Chef.

35:13.010 --> 35:14.470
Was that you at your best, then?

35:14.480 --> 35:17.670
I felt like I did pretty well.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.440
- Men.
- (Men) Yes, Chef.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.140
Too inconsistent.

35:21.150 --> 35:24.990
Fifth service, I expect
it absolutely perfect.

35:26.120 --> 35:27.810
- Aaron.
- Yes, Chef.

35:27.820 --> 35:31.020
<i>I babysat you</i> <i>with the scallops.</i>

35:31.030 --> 35:33.700
How did we get raw scallops?
I'm not sure, Chef.

35:35.470 --> 35:38.130
So the losing team tonight is...

35:40.670 --> 35:44.400
Is the red team.

35:44.410 --> 35:47.070
<i>Ladies, go back</i> <i>to the dorm</i>

35:47.080 --> 35:50.470
and think of two nominees
you'd like to lose

35:50.480 --> 35:52.640
<i>from your team based on
everything you've seen</i>

35:52.650 --> 35:54.940
<i>and what the red team</i> <i>have done so far.</i>

35:54.950 --> 35:57.190
Piss off.

35:58.820 --> 36:01.650
So how are we gonna
decide what we're doing?

36:01.660 --> 36:03.550
Because we got to
eliminate somebody tonight.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.050
<i>We got to figure out</i> <i>a way to do this.</i>

36:05.060 --> 36:06.490
Well, he said to eliminate
two people that you don't want

36:06.500 --> 36:07.690
<i>in the kitchen anymore.</i>

36:07.700 --> 36:08.920
I mean, I don't think there's anyone

36:08.930 --> 36:11.020
that I personally don't
want in the kitchen.

36:11.030 --> 36:12.830
<i>I'm just looking</i> <i>at tonight's service.</i>

36:12.840 --> 36:14.590
What backed up apps initially?

36:14.600 --> 36:16.530
That capellini.

36:16.540 --> 36:18.430
Whose responsibility was the capellini?

36:18.440 --> 36:19.730
<i>(Katie)</i> <i>I started it.</i>

36:19.740 --> 36:23.240
It was established that the
[Bleep] was only started,

36:23.250 --> 36:25.910
that it still was missing,
like, ingredients.

36:25.920 --> 36:28.010
(Katie) You're good. That's ready too.

36:28.020 --> 36:30.610
Thank you.

36:30.620 --> 36:32.850
I'm really [Bleep] pissed right now.

36:32.860 --> 36:36.280
Like, I cannot even believe
that this is happening.

36:36.290 --> 36:37.850
I'm ready to vote.

36:37.860 --> 36:38.850
Well, who's your vote?

36:38.860 --> 36:41.760
Apps. Me?

36:41.770 --> 36:44.090
I'm gonna vote for the
station that had a dish

36:44.100 --> 36:45.760
that came back that looked like [Bleep].

36:45.770 --> 36:47.290
Kalen... she's a weak link.

36:47.300 --> 36:48.400
She needs to go home.

36:48.410 --> 36:50.530
You had a lot of [Bleep]
problems on garnish.

36:50.540 --> 36:51.970
I think Roe should go home.

36:51.980 --> 36:54.630
Roe [Bleep] herself on that station.

36:54.640 --> 36:56.470
Man, whatever. Throw my ass up there.

36:56.480 --> 36:57.940
I want to hear what he has to say about it.

36:57.950 --> 37:01.170
I did very well tonight.

37:01.180 --> 37:03.240
You didn't even look at the [Bleep] dish

37:03.250 --> 37:06.310
to make sure that it was
correct before you took it up.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.990
Like, it's your station.

37:11.590 --> 37:14.960
[Dramatic music]

37:14.970 --> 37:22.970
♪ ♪

37:24.010 --> 37:27.830
Ladies, you were so far behind the men,

37:27.840 --> 37:29.570
it was unbelievable.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.040
It's not how you start this competition.

37:31.050 --> 37:32.410
It's how you finish.

37:32.420 --> 37:36.640
The opening night service
is becoming more of a fluke.

37:36.650 --> 37:39.110
Ladies, have you reached a decision?

37:39.120 --> 37:41.080
(All) Yes, Chef.

37:41.090 --> 37:43.380
La Tasha, who do you want
to lose out of the red team?

37:43.390 --> 37:44.450
Two names.

37:44.460 --> 37:48.620
(La Tasha) We choose, uh...

37:48.630 --> 37:51.520
Katie and Kalen.

37:51.530 --> 37:54.090
We got out of the gates
with a very slow start,

37:54.100 --> 37:56.030
and appetizer station

37:56.040 --> 37:58.600
<i>is a big part of the reason</i> <i>for that, Chef.</i>

37:58.610 --> 38:00.100
<i>(Gordon)</i> <i>I don't get it.</i>

38:00.110 --> 38:04.770
I asked you to base it
on your entire time here,

38:04.780 --> 38:06.840
<i>not a station</i> <i>from tonight's service.</i>

38:06.850 --> 38:08.070
I didn't say that.

38:08.080 --> 38:11.180
So the two people that you
want to lose from your team

38:11.190 --> 38:14.610
to make the red team
better, who are they, Katie?

38:14.620 --> 38:17.180
Based off of the entire
time that we've been here...

38:17.190 --> 38:21.790
five services. I would say... I don't...

38:21.800 --> 38:25.560
- I mean, I...
- All I want are two names.

38:25.570 --> 38:29.730
Kalen and, uh...

38:29.740 --> 38:32.300
I... um, I...

38:32.310 --> 38:34.480
[groans]

38:43.950 --> 38:46.510
(Narrator) After a painfully
slow and chaotic dinner service

38:46.520 --> 38:48.810
for the red team, the women nominated...

38:48.820 --> 38:50.440
- Katie...
- (Narrator) And...

38:50.450 --> 38:52.440
- Kalen.
- (Narrator) For elimination.

38:52.450 --> 38:54.450
But Chef Ramsay is not sure the red team

38:54.460 --> 38:56.250
understood their assignment...

38:56.260 --> 39:00.920
I asked you to base it
on your entire time here.

39:00.930 --> 39:04.720
(Narrator) And demands that Katie
name the two weakest chefs overall.

39:04.730 --> 39:07.030
All I want are two names.

39:07.040 --> 39:10.800
I would say, um, Kalen and...

39:10.810 --> 39:13.770
uh, I... um, I...

39:15.840 --> 39:18.550
Myself, Chef.

39:22.920 --> 39:26.710
Kalen and Katie, step forward.

39:26.720 --> 39:29.160
<i>Wow.</i>

39:30.590 --> 39:32.750
Katie, why do you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:32.760 --> 39:34.320
I've owned my mistakes
since I've been here.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.360
I haven't had a bad dinner service.

39:36.370 --> 39:38.590
I want this, Chef. I want to be here.

39:38.600 --> 39:39.890
I appreciate all those words,

39:39.900 --> 39:42.390
but you just told me that you
are one of the weakest cooks

39:42.400 --> 39:44.400
in the ladies' team.

39:44.410 --> 39:45.400
<i>Here's the thing:</i>

39:45.410 --> 39:48.270
Nobody who ever wants to be a head Chef

39:48.280 --> 39:52.040
would nominate themselves.

39:52.050 --> 39:54.640
Kalen, why do you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:54.650 --> 39:56.170
I think I should stay in Hell's Kitchen

39:56.180 --> 39:58.580
because I only had two
bad services out of five.

39:58.590 --> 40:00.750
<i>I prepped my ass off. I
did get better tonight.</i>

40:00.760 --> 40:02.610
We should not be standing here.

40:02.620 --> 40:05.050
There are other people that
held up dinner service.

40:05.060 --> 40:07.490
We had nothing come back
except that one capellini.

40:07.500 --> 40:10.420
I kicked [Bleep] ass in service tonight.

40:10.430 --> 40:14.260
This is a very difficult decision for me.

40:14.270 --> 40:16.700
- Ashley.
- Yes, Chef.

40:16.710 --> 40:18.960
Who makes the red team the weakest,

40:18.970 --> 40:20.470
<i>Kalen or Katie?</i>

40:20.480 --> 40:21.470
Kalen, Chef.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.370
Kalen. Jennifer.

40:23.380 --> 40:25.700
Kalen, Chef.

40:25.710 --> 40:28.370
- <i>Roe.</i>
- Kalen, Chef.

40:28.380 --> 40:30.810
- Sade.
- Kalen, Chef.

40:30.820 --> 40:33.850
<i>La Tasha.</i> Kalen, Chef.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.160
Tough one. Really tough.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.800
My decision is...

40:45.270 --> 40:46.790
Katie.

40:46.800 --> 40:48.590
Wake up. Back in line.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.430
- Thank you, Chef.
- <i>Kalen.</i>

40:51.440 --> 40:55.630
Your team have turned their back on you.

40:55.640 --> 40:57.040
Please give me your jacket.

40:59.650 --> 41:00.640
(Both) Thank you.

41:00.650 --> 41:03.250
Good night.

41:06.820 --> 41:09.280
(Kalen) I never, ever in my wildest dreams

41:09.290 --> 41:12.120
thought that I would get
kicked off for doing well,

41:12.130 --> 41:13.890
but I'm gonna walk away from here

41:13.900 --> 41:15.650
staying true to myself.

41:15.660 --> 41:18.690
Red team, good luck. Karma's a bitch.

41:18.700 --> 41:21.290
You better watch your backs,
'cause nobody's got it.

41:21.300 --> 41:24.130
- Now, get out of here.
- Yes, Chef.

41:24.140 --> 41:26.770
I feel like I dodged a huge bullet.

41:26.780 --> 41:28.770
I want this more than anything,

41:28.780 --> 41:31.240
and I'm not gonna go down without a fight.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.410
Ladies, I don't know

41:34.420 --> 41:36.440
what backwoods kitchen you came out of.

41:36.450 --> 41:38.380
But I laugh a little on the inside,

41:38.390 --> 41:41.250
and I just hope they tear themselves down.

41:41.260 --> 41:43.360
Blaze of glory right there, just...

41:46.290 --> 41:48.620
(Gordon) In Kalen's mind,
her performance was flawless,

41:48.630 --> 41:51.160
and every dish she cooked was perfect.

41:51.170 --> 41:53.890
Unfortunately for her, I live in reality.

41:53.900 --> 41:56.100
Dream on, Kalen.

41:59.540 --> 42:02.370
(Narrator) Next time on <i> Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:02.380 --> 42:03.800
(Jennifer) [Bleep] you.

42:03.810 --> 42:05.440
I'm not gonna [Bleep] sugarcoat
everything for everybody.

42:05.450 --> 42:08.110
Don't get mad. [Groans]

42:08.120 --> 42:11.080
(Narrator) The red team
stages an inter-Jen-tion.

42:11.090 --> 42:12.580
You can't control your mouth.

42:12.590 --> 42:14.050
I don't have to [Bleep] filter [Bleep].

42:14.060 --> 42:16.550
(Narrator) But that only
pisses her off more.

42:16.560 --> 42:18.220
[Bleep] you.

42:18.230 --> 42:21.020
(Narrator) And the men's team
is also headed for implosion.

42:21.030 --> 42:23.190
You talk a big game, but you ain't [Bleep].

42:23.200 --> 42:25.660
(Narrator) And just when
Chef Ramsay has had enough...

42:25.670 --> 42:28.760
You and you, [Bleep] get out.

42:28.770 --> 42:30.530
You and you, [Bleep] off.

42:30.540 --> 42:32.300
(Narrator) One Chef on the red team...

42:32.310 --> 42:33.330
(Gordon) Just look.

42:33.340 --> 42:34.770
(Narrator) Does the unthinkable.

42:34.780 --> 42:36.800
They were fine when I flipped them. What?

42:36.810 --> 42:37.970
(Narrator) It's game over.

42:37.980 --> 42:39.570
Bitch. Keep your mouth shut.

42:39.580 --> 42:40.640
Get out!

42:40.650 --> 42:42.870
Shut the [Bleep] up. [Bleep] off.

42:42.880 --> 42:44.810
- (Narrator) And Chef Ramsay...
- Give me your jacket.

42:44.820 --> 42:46.880
(Narrator) Decides it's
time to clean house.

42:46.890 --> 42:48.710
I'm not done yet. Take off your jacket.

42:48.720 --> 42:51.680

a wild ride, next time...
