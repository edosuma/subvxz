WEBVTT

00:42.844 --> 00:44.734
It's to you, Hutch.

00:44.764 --> 00:46.714
Director Hutchins.

00:57.514 --> 00:58.574
Did you hear that?

00:58.604 --> 01:01.240
Can't hear anything with
you splashing the pot.

01:01.264 --> 01:03.850
Len, who's your girl
on point? Foster-Yates?

01:03.874 --> 01:05.804
Yeah.

01:06.354 --> 01:07.844
Agent Foster-Yates, come in.

01:07.884 --> 01:09.720
Yes, sir... is there a problem?

01:09.744 --> 01:12.494
We just heard a noise on the patio.

01:14.854 --> 01:17.614
- Foster-Yates!
- I'm on my way, sir.

01:19.374 --> 01:21.850
Get back inside! Stay inside, Director.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.650
- One through four, secure the perimeter.
- What the hell's going on?

01:23.674 --> 01:26.750
Five through eight, converge
on SecNav's residence.

01:26.774 --> 01:28.730
- We got an agent down!
- Lock down the perimeter.

01:28.754 --> 01:30.270
Secure the doors.

01:30.294 --> 01:32.664
Get an ambulance... now!

02:06.194 --> 02:08.264
- Dead man is ICE.
- That's cold.

02:08.714 --> 02:11.014
Immigration Customs Enforcement.

02:11.044 --> 02:13.760
- This is turning into a circus.
- Here come the clowns.

02:13.784 --> 02:16.834
FBI does have jurisdiction in
the death of a federal agent.

02:16.874 --> 02:21.194
Well, I like our chances, with Gibbs in there
waving a chair like Gunther Gebel-Williams.

02:21.234 --> 02:24.520
Lion tamer. He's my second
favorite hero after Steve McQueen.

02:24.544 --> 02:27.750
Sure, because riding a motorcycle
looks cool and all, but...

02:27.774 --> 02:29.800
But no one messes with a
man driving an elephant.

02:29.824 --> 02:34.170
A game of cards between the agency chiefs
at the Secretary of the Navy's house.

02:34.194 --> 02:35.654
Love to be a fly on that wall.

02:35.684 --> 02:37.564
To buzz and irritate the big bosses?

02:37.604 --> 02:40.084
No, to eavesdrop on their conversation.

02:40.124 --> 02:42.184
That is an invasion of privacy, McGee.

02:42.214 --> 02:44.750
Mind your backs there, please.

02:44.774 --> 02:49.270
Ladies and gentlemen, the amazing
Dr. Donald "Ducky" Mallard,

02:49.294 --> 02:53.224
the first and only
M.E.under the big top.

02:53.264 --> 02:58.840
Not to slight your penchant for theatrics,
Anthony, but, uh, where is our ringmaster?

02:58.864 --> 03:01.784
Duking it out for the job with
Fornell and some girl from ICE.

03:02.314 --> 03:03.270
Excuse me.

03:03.294 --> 03:04.994
A murder investigation?

03:05.024 --> 03:07.824
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.904
Agent Sherman could've had a
heart attack, for all we know.

03:10.944 --> 03:12.584
Medical examiner is here.

03:13.034 --> 03:19.120
Great. NCIS takes the lead,
supported by FBI, I.C.E.

03:19.144 --> 03:21.310
CIA can go home.

03:21.334 --> 03:24.544
- My house, my rules.
- Good luck.

03:25.144 --> 03:27.254
All yours.

03:27.754 --> 03:31.164
Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

03:31.194 --> 03:34.184
Agent Julia Foster-Yates. So...

03:34.534 --> 03:36.834
cards on the table.

03:37.394 --> 03:40.260
Four high-profile
targets in the same room.

03:40.284 --> 03:42.714
We were tasked with protection.

03:43.204 --> 03:45.440
For a poker game.

03:45.464 --> 03:48.530
We take even the simplest
assignments very seriously.

03:48.554 --> 03:51.024
Not seriously enough.

03:56.794 --> 03:58.620
Looks like someone
dropped a cocktail wienie.

03:58.644 --> 04:00.394
I have a riddle for you.

04:00.434 --> 04:06.330
What is not food, but tastes very well?

04:06.354 --> 04:07.750
I'll give you a hint.

04:07.774 --> 04:13.160
And you should come up with the answer before
Officer David, since it's right on the...

04:13.184 --> 04:14.990
Tip of your tongue.

04:15.014 --> 04:16.144
He bit it off.

04:16.184 --> 04:19.564
He was flailing, losing
control of his limbs.

04:22.494 --> 04:23.830
Was he poisoned?

04:23.854 --> 04:25.260
No, I don't think so.

04:25.284 --> 04:28.900
He has this severe bruise on his neck.

04:28.924 --> 04:31.380
No, this man was attacked.

04:31.404 --> 04:32.424
Are you certain?

04:32.464 --> 04:35.070
Are you the one that performed CPR?

04:35.094 --> 04:36.450
Unsuccessfully.

04:36.474 --> 04:40.170
Well, it was the right instinct.
This man was oxygen-deprived.

04:40.194 --> 04:43.894
See, he has petechial
hemorrhaging in his eyes.

04:43.924 --> 04:46.104
He was strangled.

04:46.714 --> 04:50.374
That would suggest someone
penetrated our security web unseen.

04:50.404 --> 04:51.990
And why is that so unlikely?

04:52.014 --> 04:54.954
Because I designed it. It was airtight.

04:56.224 --> 04:58.844
Apparently not.

05:01.084 --> 05:04.484
Downloaded all the footage from the
surveillance cams covering the grounds.

05:04.524 --> 05:06.784
Patio's a blind spot.

05:07.694 --> 05:09.934
Bosses get together couple times a year.

05:09.964 --> 05:12.920
Locations and responsibilities rotate.

05:12.944 --> 05:15.754
SecNav's place, ICE's people.

05:16.254 --> 05:18.870
CIA brought the chips and dip.

05:18.894 --> 05:21.480
- The Bureau...
- The booze.

05:21.504 --> 05:24.340
- Little early for a drink, Jethro.
- Yeah, I might need it.

05:24.364 --> 05:26.574
To settle your gut?

05:27.404 --> 05:29.394
Something here bother you, boss?

05:29.844 --> 05:31.584
No.

05:31.844 --> 05:34.534
Nothing here.

05:36.124 --> 05:38.584
Not here.

05:39.064 --> 05:43.000
Heads of the CIA, FBI, I.C.E.

05:43.024 --> 05:45.200
That's a full bowl of alphabet soup, huh?

05:45.224 --> 05:49.314
Not all of them. Which letters
you got on your badge, McGee?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.814
Oils from his face when he
pressed against the glass.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.144
Powder is sticking. Might be adhesive.

05:57.224 --> 06:01.194
Agent DiNozzo, Officer David...

06:08.114 --> 06:09.890
A fly.

06:09.914 --> 06:11.874
Bug.

06:11.904 --> 06:13.080
On the wall.

06:13.104 --> 06:14.840
Boss, we found a listening device.

06:14.864 --> 06:16.494
Looks like it was stuck to the glass.

06:16.534 --> 06:19.464
Agent Sherman flails against the door.

06:19.494 --> 06:22.050
It gets dislodged. Falls under his body.

06:22.074 --> 06:24.354
Whatever happened here...

06:24.644 --> 06:27.554
Is still happening. Is it functional?

06:28.294 --> 06:31.900
Damaged. Best not to take any chances.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.784
No!

06:39.644 --> 06:42.150
I mean, it's not like
he left no trace behind.

06:42.174 --> 06:45.150
He left exactly one trace. The bug.

06:45.174 --> 06:49.814
But someone, in their infinite wisdom,
decided to stomp it into a hundred pieces.

06:49.854 --> 06:51.220
It might've still been transmitting.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.714
It was not transmitting.

06:52.744 --> 06:56.254
We could have tracked the signal,
you know, maybe gotten a lead.

06:56.794 --> 06:58.824
The bug stomp.

06:58.854 --> 07:01.830
It's a classic movie
move. Sounds like a Tony.

07:01.854 --> 07:03.924
Nah, it was a Jules.

07:04.864 --> 07:08.594
A Jules? What is a Jules?

07:10.534 --> 07:14.960
I'm going to have to have a word with this Jules
if we ever have the good fortune of meeting.

07:14.984 --> 07:17.324
I'd like to be here for that.

07:18.704 --> 07:22.454
What, you holding aces and eights
there, McGee? Dead man's hand?

07:22.704 --> 07:26.784
What? No, no, this is what was
on the table when the game ended.

07:29.434 --> 07:31.420
The pot's not right.

07:31.444 --> 07:33.360
What do you mean?

07:33.384 --> 07:38.770
Well... at a quick glance, it looks
like, uh, five-card draw, 50-buck ante.

07:38.794 --> 07:41.890
ICE starts the action with
two bills, three callers.**

07:41.914 --> 07:45.974
Secnav draws one to fill in an
inside straight and misses... figures.

07:46.014 --> 07:49.410
CIA keeps the cowboys, mucks
the rags, pulls a second pair.

07:49.434 --> 07:51.684
Hutch misses the flush,
but won't bow out.

07:51.714 --> 07:54.774
ICE is the clear leader,
standing pat at the wheel.

07:55.784 --> 07:57.830
I... I have no idea what you just said.

07:57.854 --> 07:59.740
You got to be an idiot
to still be in this hand.

07:59.764 --> 08:02.634
Are these guys not paying attention?
They're not playing very well.

08:02.974 --> 08:05.544
Well, obviously not as well as you.

08:07.854 --> 08:11.280
Someone was spying on the card game.

08:11.304 --> 08:12.700
Dead agent got in the way.

08:12.724 --> 08:17.444
In previous games, Davenport and his buddies have
always threatened to play till someone dropped.

08:17.474 --> 08:18.980
I guess we should have believed them.

08:19.004 --> 08:21.294
You've played with them.

08:22.034 --> 08:23.464
But not last night.

08:23.504 --> 08:26.834
Last time I played, I cleaned
Hutch out. I cleaned them all out.

08:27.324 --> 08:30.674
That's probably why they
didn't invite you back.

08:31.374 --> 08:34.404
Got a hell of a poker face.

08:35.274 --> 08:37.313
Ducky has the body.

08:37.344 --> 08:39.970
McGee's processing the scene.

08:39.994 --> 08:41.760
DiNozzo and David?

08:41.784 --> 08:43.844
Reviewing ICE's protection detail.

08:43.874 --> 08:47.734
Scouring the grounds
with Agent Foster-Yates.

08:47.764 --> 08:50.194
- Keep me updated.
- Sir.

08:53.334 --> 08:58.160
Heavy footfalls on the lawn,
directed towards the patio.

08:58.184 --> 09:01.964
Agents stationed at the perimeter converged
on the house after Sherman went down.

09:02.004 --> 09:04.444
They did not catch his attacker.

09:05.204 --> 09:08.254
He did not get out this way.

09:08.564 --> 09:12.014
Unless he could cross a lawn
without bending a blade of grass.

09:12.044 --> 09:15.354
Well, not impossible
with the proper training.

09:16.144 --> 09:20.644
She can also do that trick where you put your
ear to a rail and you can hear a train coming.

09:21.534 --> 09:24.210
- You get this same training?
- Me? No.

09:24.234 --> 09:29.174
But I can eat a bucket of chicken in
one sitting and, uh, I have X-ray vision.

09:29.594 --> 09:33.984
Complementary skill sets make
for a stronger team dynamic.

09:34.204 --> 09:37.590
I was always trying to explain
that concept to Sherman.

09:37.614 --> 09:39.760
Bit of a maverick, huh?

09:39.784 --> 09:41.964
He was a good agent.

09:42.834 --> 09:45.574
I'm sure the two of you don't
always agree on everything.

09:45.604 --> 09:47.504
No, not everything.

09:47.554 --> 09:51.974
Healthy debate breeds,
uh, creative solutions.

09:52.764 --> 09:55.230
Isn't that right, Ziva?

09:55.254 --> 09:56.184
Where did she go?

09:56.214 --> 09:58.194
A few branches are missing up here.

09:58.224 --> 10:01.130
A clear view of the property. He
could study the patrol pattern.

10:01.154 --> 10:06.954
They go in, he goes up, and
then he goes out... that gate.

10:10.134 --> 10:11.444
It's McGee.

10:11.474 --> 10:13.370
Hey, Gibbs wants you guys to come back.

10:13.394 --> 10:16.230
- I'm up a tree.
- Well, this might only confuse you further.

10:16.254 --> 10:17.940
Well, who said I was confused?

10:17.964 --> 10:19.680
- You said you're up a tree.
- I am.

10:19.704 --> 10:22.140
Why is he calling you and not
me? I'm the senior field agent.

10:22.164 --> 10:24.134
I don't know why he's
not calling you, Tony.

10:24.164 --> 10:26.010
- I did call Tony.
- He's not making any sense.

10:26.034 --> 10:27.974
And you're the one not making sense.

10:28.004 --> 10:30.564
He said he called you.

10:31.154 --> 10:32.394
I'm not getting a signal.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.020
How come you're getting
a signal and I'm not?

10:34.044 --> 10:36.074
Because I'm up a tree.

10:37.564 --> 10:40.154
We solve cases all the time like this.

10:42.694 --> 10:43.990
What did McGee have to say?

10:44.014 --> 10:46.124
That it is time to go.

10:47.444 --> 10:50.410
Using his forearm and biceps,

10:50.434 --> 10:54.154
the attacker puts pressure
on both sides of the neck,

10:54.184 --> 10:57.580
cutting off the blood supply
through the carotid arteries.

10:57.604 --> 11:00.654
Here. Cradled in the crook of his arm...

11:02.184 --> 11:06.290
The trachea and larynx remain unharmed.

11:06.314 --> 11:10.520
Tobias, Tobi... you, you push
up on a rear choke, not down,

11:10.544 --> 11:13.254
- and you turn your chin into your shoulder.
- Yeah.

11:13.714 --> 11:18.954
After a few moments in the aptly named sleeper
hold, and the victim loses consciousness.

11:18.984 --> 11:24.314
Failure to release the pressure
causes a complete systematic shutdown.

11:24.344 --> 11:27.794
- The bladder and bowels release.
- Hey, Duck?

11:29.714 --> 11:33.434
Oh, continue the pressure
and the result is inevitable.

11:33.764 --> 11:35.614
Death.

11:35.944 --> 11:37.174
By asphyxiation.

11:37.214 --> 11:41.774
Yeah, well, that's what I was
anticipating but not what I discovered.

11:41.804 --> 11:44.240
Agent Sherman's medical records.

11:44.264 --> 11:49.064
He had warning signs of
atherosclerotic disease.

11:49.094 --> 11:53.490
Aggravated by the temporary
deprivation of blood to the brain and...

11:53.514 --> 11:54.844
He suffered a fatal stroke.

11:54.884 --> 11:57.774
Yeah, but if the attacker's
intent was to kill,

11:57.824 --> 12:02.004
he would have held the choke hold
long enough until the lungs failed.

12:02.034 --> 12:04.714
- I'm good.
- But he didn't.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.910
Attack wasn't meant to be lethal.

12:07.934 --> 12:09.784
Well, that's what I think.

12:09.814 --> 12:14.230
So the intruder makes his way
quickly through a secure perimeter,

12:14.254 --> 12:18.620
subdues the only guard he encounters silently,
and leaves a listening device behind.

12:18.644 --> 12:19.864
And vanishes.

12:19.894 --> 12:24.764
We're dealing with a pro, which eliminates
the neighbor kid retrieving a lost Frisbee.

12:25.304 --> 12:28.974
I'll have the Bureau compile profiles.

12:37.074 --> 12:39.894
Using your X-ray vision?

12:40.934 --> 12:42.900
Black lace, matching set.

12:42.924 --> 12:46.004
Really? On the job?

12:46.974 --> 12:51.234
SECNAV usually has an NCIS agent
tasked to guard him at all times,

12:51.264 --> 12:53.494
but ICE was assigned the detail.

12:53.524 --> 12:55.484
Ten men in total, huh?

12:55.524 --> 12:57.994
For a poker game they
were not even playing.

13:00.784 --> 13:03.584
Why don't you tell us
what's really going on?

13:04.604 --> 13:07.624
The game was just a cover. Wasn't it?

13:10.814 --> 13:13.984
I was instructed not
to reveal any details.

13:14.014 --> 13:17.154
Oh, I think you should
disregard that instruction.

13:18.984 --> 13:23.974
Four agencies filled with people who
speclize in finding out information.

13:25.754 --> 13:28.954
It was an intelligence summit.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.344
What was the subject?

13:32.764 --> 13:35.664
I wish I knew.

13:36.164 --> 13:39.774
Whatever it was, someone was
willing to kill to find out.

13:50.954 --> 13:52.434
Intelligence summit?

13:52.464 --> 13:55.084
Seems like your classic
contradiction in terms.

13:55.114 --> 13:57.134
Don't give me the look; I didn't know.

13:57.164 --> 13:58.170
You had suspicions.

13:58.194 --> 14:00.850
Because you had suspicions.
I'm riding shotgun here, Gibbs.

14:00.874 --> 14:02.750
- Yeah, can I borrow it?
- Go easy, Hoss.

14:02.774 --> 14:04.884
She was just doing what she was told.

14:04.924 --> 14:09.184
You do not get to determine what
is worth sharing and what is not.

14:09.504 --> 14:12.640
- I don't answer to you, Agent Gibbs.
- Yes, you do.

14:12.664 --> 14:15.244
Yes... you... do.

14:17.414 --> 14:20.084
What else have you left out?

14:22.764 --> 14:24.850
Perimeter!

14:24.874 --> 14:27.610
Uh, solid design, boss. Effective.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.720
Barring human error.

14:29.744 --> 14:33.314
Are you suggesting I'm incompetent
or this was an inside job?

14:33.354 --> 14:35.274
Dealer's choice.

14:37.044 --> 14:40.830
Boss, you know, I could use the
footage to build an animated model

14:40.854 --> 14:43.434
and recreate the movements
of all the players,

14:43.474 --> 14:45.774
see if there was any
possible path of entry.

14:45.804 --> 14:48.600
All I would need is
the position reports.

14:48.624 --> 14:50.824
You got that. Help him out.

14:55.704 --> 14:58.394
Starting to doubt the
invisible man theory, boss?

15:00.154 --> 15:01.254
Backgrounds.

15:01.294 --> 15:05.374
Every agent on the detail last night...
Personal and professional histories.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.604
Possible suspects with
the necessary skills,

15:07.634 --> 15:11.164
starting with known foreign
operatives in the area.

15:12.584 --> 15:14.634
FBI profiles.

15:14.674 --> 15:17.030
Really help narrow it down if we
knew what the summit was about.

15:17.054 --> 15:18.390
Yeah, it would. You got
another one of those?

15:18.414 --> 15:20.484
Triplicate.

15:20.994 --> 15:22.934
We need to know what
they were discussing.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.250
Please, come right in.

15:25.274 --> 15:27.360
It's crucial to the investigation.

15:27.384 --> 15:29.804
Suppose it goes to motive.

15:35.324 --> 15:37.660
Yes, it does, Mr. Secretary.

15:37.684 --> 15:40.124
Sit down, gentlemen.

15:52.544 --> 15:56.580
First year of a new president's term,
he's tested. Check your timeline.

15:56.604 --> 16:01.124
June, July, eight years ago,
Al-Qaeda showed themselves.

16:01.154 --> 16:05.194
In flight schools where no one was interested
in learning how to take off or land.

16:05.234 --> 16:10.644
Our opportunity was missed because agencies
weren't in the habit of sharing information.

16:10.694 --> 16:15.124
There've been far too many foreign nationals
being far too comfortable on American soil...

16:15.154 --> 16:18.844
Gun runners, terror
cells, even Israeli Mossad.

16:18.884 --> 16:20.524
You mean like Rivkin.

16:20.554 --> 16:23.744
Slipping through our borders
like 9/11 never happened.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.124
Came to a head in L.A.with OSP.

16:26.164 --> 16:29.110
Mossad's operative still hasn't
been called home since then.

16:29.134 --> 16:31.990
That's Director Eli David's
not too subtle message that

16:32.014 --> 16:35.394
we're not doing a strong enough
job of policing our own backyard.

16:35.434 --> 16:40.174
The pretext of a poker game was meant to cut
down on the chatter leading up to the summit,

16:40.204 --> 16:46.354
and the informal setting serves to loosen
stubborn lips accustomed to secrecy.

16:47.714 --> 16:50.834
- NCIS wasn't represented.
- I was there.

16:57.424 --> 17:01.334
Was one surviving member of the
cell in California Haziq Khaleel?

17:01.374 --> 17:02.574
He's in custody.

17:02.624 --> 17:05.420
Macy and Hanna... they
conducted the interrogation.

17:05.444 --> 17:06.444
Did he spill?

17:06.473 --> 17:10.013
Haziq gave up his handler Abin Tabal.

17:10.983 --> 17:14.579
- He give up anything on Callen's shooter?
- No.

17:14.604 --> 17:16.674
How's Callen doing?

17:17.464 --> 17:19.634
He's still critical.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.874
He's hanging in there.

17:22.743 --> 17:26.839
We got a guy on our watch list
using the alias Abin Tabal...

17:26.864 --> 17:29.214
Believed to be here in Washington.

17:29.794 --> 17:32.264
Chase him down.

17:35.554 --> 17:40.134
Abin Tabal, aka Adolfo
Ruiz, aka Hikmet Gillersoy,

17:40.164 --> 17:42.524
aka, like, nine other made-up names.

17:42.564 --> 17:43.940
Over the course of the last three years,

17:43.964 --> 17:47.804
he has hit the watch list with Spanish, Russian,
Chechnyan, Greek, and Cypriot passports.

17:47.844 --> 17:49.624
Doesn't keep the same one very long.

17:49.654 --> 17:53.024
The United States is the only common
destination among all the passports.

17:53.054 --> 17:57.944
Under various identities, he's landed
in Egypt, Algeria, Libya, and Niger.

17:57.974 --> 18:01.334
So the guy's got a fondness
for Northern Africa.

18:02.224 --> 18:05.470
Excuse me. Officer David.

18:05.494 --> 18:07.864
Shalom.

18:09.284 --> 18:11.780
What do you think? Training center?

18:11.804 --> 18:13.080
He's the handler.

18:13.104 --> 18:17.060
Goes back and forth between headquarters
and activating sleeper cells in the States.

18:17.084 --> 18:19.440
I'll catch Gibbs up. Find the guy.

18:19.464 --> 18:24.570
Oh, o-okay. I like taking orders
from just about anybody, I guess.

18:24.594 --> 18:27.434
Especially the guy who
framed me for murder.

18:27.464 --> 18:31.360
One minute he's framing me for murder, the next
he's treating me like a perfectly capable agent.

18:31.384 --> 18:33.374
The nerve.

18:40.134 --> 18:42.234
I have to run out for a few minutes.

18:42.274 --> 18:44.740
I'll be right back.

18:44.764 --> 18:47.434
I will be right here.

18:51.484 --> 18:54.244
******

18:55.694 --> 18:58.304
Full digitization would take all day.

18:58.334 --> 19:00.814
Quick-scan the access road footage?

19:01.444 --> 19:04.014
Exactly what I was thinking, Jules.

19:04.714 --> 19:07.790
Thanks for coming to my rescue up there.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.424
I appreciate it, Tim.

19:09.994 --> 19:12.324
My pleasure.

19:13.314 --> 19:17.570
Are you often in the habit
of destroying evidence, Jules?

19:17.594 --> 19:19.020
Beg your pardon?

19:19.044 --> 19:24.130
You should, actually, because I'm
the one responsible for reconnecting

19:24.154 --> 19:28.814
and reactivating all of those extremely
delicate pieces of electronics.

19:28.844 --> 19:31.080
- You can do that?
- Of course I can.

19:31.104 --> 19:33.024
Then what's the problem?

19:34.824 --> 19:39.290
You probably know some kind of
martial arts or something, huh?

19:39.314 --> 19:43.804
When I was in high school, my
mother was the ambassador to Bangkok.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.984
I fell in love with Muay Thai.

19:46.024 --> 19:50.814
So il tried to scratch your eyes out,
you could probably break my fingers?

19:50.844 --> 19:53.154
That would be a mistake.

19:53.194 --> 19:56.264
You need your fingers to fix that bug.

19:58.684 --> 20:01.244
And in my own lab.

20:03.714 --> 20:05.914
Rewind that security footage.

20:06.374 --> 20:08.310
Uh, it's the same car.

20:08.334 --> 20:10.130
Second time it's passed by.

20:10.154 --> 20:12.600
Casing the place. Can
you I.D.the driver?

20:12.624 --> 20:15.114
No, but I can pull the plate.

20:16.524 --> 20:19.074
Let's pull up the registration.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.450
Someone you know?

20:26.474 --> 20:28.514
I got to get Gibbs.

20:34.004 --> 20:36.660
Uh, Jules, you should
probably come with me.

20:36.684 --> 20:38.324
A vehicle.

20:38.374 --> 20:41.940
Pulled off surveillance
approaching SECNAV's house.

20:41.964 --> 20:43.900
That doesn't belong to Abin Tabal.

20:43.924 --> 20:46.950
Come on, Leon, you should be
able to recognize your own car.

20:46.974 --> 20:50.134
What were you doing outside the house?

20:50.454 --> 20:53.060
I wasn't invited inside.

20:53.084 --> 20:55.894
I'm getting very tired of
information being withheld.

20:55.924 --> 20:57.324
I know what you mean.

20:57.354 --> 20:59.500
Curiosity can make you
do some funny things.

20:59.524 --> 21:01.104
Like what?

21:01.164 --> 21:02.840
Cruise a secret meeting?

21:02.864 --> 21:05.104
Just to confirm it took place.

21:05.164 --> 21:08.220
Director Hutchins let
it slip a week ago.

21:08.244 --> 21:10.544
Before he realized you
were being excluded?

21:10.574 --> 21:12.014
It's a tough town, Gibbs.

21:12.054 --> 21:14.690
Believe it or not, I'm still
trying to get the hang of it.

21:14.714 --> 21:16.944
Relationships are delicate.

21:17.564 --> 21:19.844
Why weren't you invited?

21:22.224 --> 21:25.044
Because they were
there to talk about me.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.390
I wish I could stay for lunch, Michael.

21:29.414 --> 21:31.484
That's okay. Join me for a drink.

21:33.344 --> 21:35.614
Another vodka, just a splash
of soda this time, please.

21:35.664 --> 21:37.284
Uh, nothing for me, thanks.

21:38.364 --> 21:40.194
I'm working on a case.

21:43.204 --> 21:45.414
Tell me.

21:47.584 --> 21:50.024
This is what a relationship looks like.

21:50.054 --> 21:51.984
How was your day, dear?

21:54.514 --> 21:57.074
I'll tell you when it's over.

22:04.974 --> 22:06.290
Tony, I thought I told you I would...

22:06.314 --> 22:08.800
Shut up. You gotta get
back here right now.

22:08.824 --> 22:10.274
- Okay.
- Now!

22:10.814 --> 22:12.474
Okay.

22:13.824 --> 22:14.890
You have to go already?

22:14.914 --> 22:18.390
Well, we're looking for a terrorist,
and Tony says we just found him, so...

22:18.414 --> 22:20.244
I'll see you later?

22:34.634 --> 22:36.814
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:38.677 --> 22:40.564
Is this seat taken?

22:48.514 --> 22:53.474
This is a little like that scene in
Heat when Pacino and DeNiro finally meet.

22:53.914 --> 22:56.070
I'm DeNiro in this scene?

22:56.094 --> 22:59.500
You think you're DeNiro
in this scene. Okay.

22:59.524 --> 23:01.310
You can call me Al.

23:01.334 --> 23:02.720
I'll spare you the singing.

23:02.744 --> 23:05.224
You've come to chase her away from me.

23:05.974 --> 23:07.840
Mikey Israel.

23:07.864 --> 23:10.420
In the very tan flesh.
Trip to L.A.did you good.

23:10.444 --> 23:12.754
Ziva prefers darker skin.

23:13.144 --> 23:15.624
How does she like being played?

23:16.334 --> 23:21.224
'Cause I think we both know,
this romance isn't kosher.

23:21.504 --> 23:25.704
I can understand your suspicions, given
what we have about you in your dossier...

23:25.734 --> 23:27.394
Agent Meatball.

23:27.434 --> 23:32.594
There's an El Al flight tonight
out of Ronald Reagan at 8:25 p.m.

23:32.634 --> 23:35.494
Lands at Ben-Gurion tomorrow evening.

23:37.844 --> 23:40.070
I'm not finished
spending time with Ziva.

23:40.094 --> 23:41.834
NCIS says you are.

23:41.874 --> 23:46.074
Ziva's very lucky to have
a man like you in her life.

23:46.514 --> 23:49.650
Like a... big brother.

23:49.674 --> 23:53.484
I've got some work to do, and you
clearly have some drinking to finish,

23:53.514 --> 23:57.134
and after that, I think
you should start packing.

24:01.784 --> 24:05.770
You can question my feelings
for Ziva all you want.

24:05.794 --> 24:12.090
Unfortunately, you can't question
her feelings for me. Can you?

24:12.114 --> 24:16.054
Say good-bye, Mikey. Get on the flight.

24:23.484 --> 24:27.640
We've reconstructed everyone's movements from
last night on this is a wire frame representation

24:27.664 --> 24:29.594
of the SecNav's residence.

24:29.624 --> 24:33.314
These blue figures represent
the agents on patrol.

24:33.724 --> 24:37.754
The units moved in overlapping
sweeping patterns on the outer layer.

24:37.814 --> 24:39.690
The inner layer was stationary.

24:39.714 --> 24:41.030
Sophisticated.

24:41.054 --> 24:45.434
Even if someone managed to get through the
outer ring unseen, their path would be limited.

24:45.464 --> 24:47.524
They'd be funneled into plain sight.

24:47.554 --> 24:50.330
So, what went wrong?

24:50.354 --> 24:52.560
Well, there's a hole in the net.

24:52.584 --> 24:57.724
When Sherman leaves to take the position
on the patio, leaves this avenue wide open.

24:58.714 --> 25:00.490
Yes, it does.

25:00.514 --> 25:02.934
Well, you got an explanation?

25:05.874 --> 25:08.114
It's an error.

25:11.474 --> 25:15.494
Nobody's perfect, Jules. Not you
and not this guy. We'll find him.

25:16.844 --> 25:18.764
Ziva, you got those backgrounds?

25:19.574 --> 25:23.030
Almost finished. These
are what we have so far.

25:23.054 --> 25:25.394
- Got to check in with my boss.
- Sure.

25:26.194 --> 25:28.330
- Abby needs my help with the bug.
- Go.

25:28.354 --> 25:31.840
This idea of friendly relations
between agencies, full disclosure...

25:31.864 --> 25:34.340
Flies in the face of history.

25:34.364 --> 25:36.514
You vouch for the ICE princess?

25:36.544 --> 25:39.554
She's cool on the outside,
but when she opens up, she's...

25:39.914 --> 25:43.700
she's full of beans, molten
cheese, like a microwave burrito.

25:43.724 --> 25:45.594
What? I'm hungry.

26:00.534 --> 26:04.454
******

26:07.374 --> 26:09.454
So when the bug is working properly,

26:09.484 --> 26:13.444
it emits a signal that can piggyback
on any available internet connection,

26:13.484 --> 26:18.430
and then, it can upload the audio to
a live stream on a private Web site.

26:18.454 --> 26:20.564
Oh, so, basically, it's a fancy tin can.

26:20.594 --> 26:22.904
We follow the string to
the can on the other end.

26:23.564 --> 26:26.274
What, you never camped out
in the backyard as a kid?

26:26.314 --> 26:29.434
Are you crazy? There were
alligators in my backyard.

26:33.724 --> 26:36.740
You know, you don't really
need my help with this.

26:36.764 --> 26:39.744
Second set of hands can't hurt.

26:41.094 --> 26:43.430
You feeling neglected?

26:43.454 --> 26:47.184
Neglected? More like nauseous.

26:47.484 --> 26:51.024
Having to watch you
flirt with that Jules.

26:51.474 --> 26:53.374
Come on. I wasn't flirting.

26:55.654 --> 27:00.004
Your hands drifting across the keyboard.

27:00.034 --> 27:03.674
Pinkies accidentally grazing each other.

27:03.704 --> 27:05.930
Please. I know.

27:05.954 --> 27:08.344
She's out of my league, anyway, Abs.

27:08.934 --> 27:11.224
No, she's not.

27:18.724 --> 27:20.494
We have not found Tabal yet.

27:20.524 --> 27:22.084
We really should be working harder.

27:22.114 --> 27:26.094
I came back here quickly because
you said we had found Abin Tabal.

27:26.694 --> 27:28.974
Where were you?

27:30.174 --> 27:32.444
Where were you?

27:34.244 --> 27:37.780
He was in L.A.on business just
like he's in D.C.on business.

27:37.804 --> 27:40.670
I cannot believe you. If you wanted to meet
him, you could ask me to introduce you.

27:40.694 --> 27:44.164
I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't check on him.

27:46.964 --> 27:48.744
Gibbs told him to clock out.

27:48.774 --> 27:50.544
I told him to clock out.

27:50.574 --> 27:53.324
Perhaps it would carry some
more weight if it came from you.

27:53.354 --> 27:57.200
Michael is here to see me. He is
not working. He is on vacation.

27:57.224 --> 28:00.274
Well, he certainly is drinking like it.

28:07.294 --> 28:09.584
Conference room this way?

28:10.474 --> 28:13.004
I'll show you.

28:23.944 --> 28:28.374
CPB hasn't gotten a hit yet on
any of Abin Tabal's known aliases.

28:28.414 --> 28:31.264
Likely he's still in the country.

28:32.304 --> 28:35.134
The invisible man.

28:38.334 --> 28:42.744
The results of interviews with
every member of your team last night.

28:43.684 --> 28:46.844
There were some bad
feelings circulating.

28:47.124 --> 28:50.684
Inevitable with any team, I imagine.

28:51.384 --> 28:55.240
Performance reviews...
Agent Sherman's and yours.

28:55.264 --> 29:00.114
He had four more years of service than
you did, but you were promoted over him.

29:00.144 --> 29:03.660
With good cause. You'll notice my
evals and recs were consistently higher.

29:03.684 --> 29:09.670
He openly objected to taking orders
from a woman with less seniority.

29:09.694 --> 29:12.574
You can't have appreciated that.

29:14.174 --> 29:17.814
Agent Sherman was very
passionate about his duty.

29:19.894 --> 29:23.044
He was a thorn in your side.

29:24.574 --> 29:26.064
Let's just stop right here,

29:26.114 --> 29:30.934
before you embarrass yourselves by actually
accusing me of killing Agent Sherman!

29:31.994 --> 29:34.514
I lost an agent last night.

29:34.544 --> 29:37.824
Maybe that gets easier with
time, but for me, it's...

29:43.854 --> 29:46.360
I've been trying not to kick
dirt on a dead man's grave.

29:46.384 --> 29:48.430
That's my mistake.

29:48.454 --> 29:51.334
His death is not...

29:52.184 --> 29:54.874
He wasn't supposed to be on the patio.

29:55.584 --> 29:58.624
He was out of position.

29:59.174 --> 30:01.664
He disregarded his assignment.

30:02.254 --> 30:04.190
- Why?
- I don't know.

30:04.214 --> 30:06.104
Spite. Jealousy.

30:07.714 --> 30:10.874
He was never concerned
about making me look bad.

30:13.734 --> 30:17.464
There was a hole in the
net because he moved.

30:18.854 --> 30:22.284
He's dead for the same reason
he never got the promotion.

30:24.104 --> 30:26.704
He didn't operate as part of a team.

30:27.514 --> 30:29.974
And you do?

30:30.964 --> 30:32.954
Yeah. Gibbs.

30:33.264 --> 30:35.364
Yeah. All right.

30:36.034 --> 30:38.714
Abby's got a link to Tabal.

30:49.194 --> 30:51.534
You coming?

30:59.184 --> 31:01.694
Schematics of SecNav's house.

31:04.074 --> 31:07.184
- Looks like our guy.
- So does this.

31:11.094 --> 31:13.280
Abin Tabal.

31:13.304 --> 31:16.354
Well, at least now we
know he really existed.

31:25.344 --> 31:27.404
Potassium cyanide poisoning.

31:27.434 --> 31:33.234
We found a residue of silica and polyisoprene
between his first and second premolars.

31:33.284 --> 31:35.760
He bit down on a suicide pill.

31:35.784 --> 31:38.344
- Just a few hours ago.
- Yeah.

31:39.614 --> 31:42.460
No signs of forced entry at the motel.

31:42.484 --> 31:45.204
No indication of any struggle.

31:45.544 --> 31:48.644
Abin Tabal killed himself.

31:49.494 --> 31:51.060
This guy's supposed to be invisible.

31:51.084 --> 31:53.264
That's his primary
asset as an operative.

31:53.304 --> 31:57.080
He loses that when he accidentally
kills an American agent.

31:57.104 --> 31:58.510
His usefulness is gone.

31:58.534 --> 32:01.170
We close off all exit routes.

32:01.194 --> 32:04.844
So he decides to take
the only other way out.

32:06.414 --> 32:08.204
You back this psychology?

32:08.494 --> 32:11.260
Yeah. If-If he was a true believer.

32:11.284 --> 32:16.630
If he believed himself a threat to the
cause, then exposure becomes his enemy.

32:16.654 --> 32:19.454
If he removes himself,
he removes the problem.

32:19.484 --> 32:22.484
After he's passed on all the
intel he's managed to accumulate.

32:22.524 --> 32:24.474
He wiped his computer.

32:24.514 --> 32:25.800
Abby's sifting through it.

32:25.824 --> 32:29.864
But she already connected the laptop to
the electronics and the listening device?

32:33.134 --> 32:34.984
Smoking gun.

32:37.324 --> 32:39.620
Case closed. Write it up.

32:39.644 --> 32:42.320
I think you're already packed up, McGee.

32:42.344 --> 32:46.024
He's delaying his departure
to coincide with someone else.

32:48.894 --> 32:52.104
It was nice working with you
guys. Thank you for everything.

32:52.484 --> 32:54.494
- Yeah, you, too.
- You, too.

32:54.854 --> 32:56.814
I'll walk out with you.

32:56.854 --> 32:59.474
So what did Gibbs and
Fornell have to say?

32:59.504 --> 33:03.284
They were just apologizing for
implying I might be a murderer.

33:04.264 --> 33:07.080
- You're kidding. They were?
- Yes.

33:07.104 --> 33:09.814
- The both of them?
- That's so shocking?

33:11.644 --> 33:13.574
Well, uh...

33:14.124 --> 33:18.430
You know, it might take a while to
fully grasp the significance of that.

33:18.454 --> 33:22.580
Okay. Explain it to
me. I've got no plans.

33:22.604 --> 33:24.304
All right.

33:24.334 --> 33:27.454
Did Gibbs actually say
the words, "I'm sorry"?

33:31.724 --> 33:34.184
- Good night.
- Night.

33:42.194 --> 33:44.804
Rule Number 11, DiNozzo.

33:45.224 --> 33:48.110
I would never date a
co-worker, boss. Trust me.

33:48.134 --> 33:50.394
I mean, why would you even...

33:51.534 --> 33:52.704
That's 12.

33:52.734 --> 33:57.360
11.when the job is done, walk away.

33:57.384 --> 33:59.800
The case is wrapped up, DiNozzo.

33:59.824 --> 34:01.524
In a nice, little bow.

34:01.554 --> 34:05.650
And, and that works for you, Fornell?
Crazy terrorist kills himself.

34:05.674 --> 34:08.600
Can't really understand that mentality.

34:08.623 --> 34:11.274
Doesn't mean I can't accept it.

34:18.404 --> 34:21.543
So what's on your mind?

34:22.204 --> 34:24.340
Rivkin's been in town.

34:24.364 --> 34:26.154
I know.

34:26.704 --> 34:28.813
With Ziva.

34:28.844 --> 34:30.194
Guy doesn't listen.

34:30.234 --> 34:33.420
Does that bother you on a
professional level or a personal one?

34:33.444 --> 34:37.594
Well, I tell you what... I'm having
a little trouble untangling the two.

34:37.954 --> 34:40.050
So you are bothered.

34:40.074 --> 34:42.543
Oh, yeah.

34:44.884 --> 34:48.643
It bothers me. You stay on it.

34:49.474 --> 34:51.724
Yep.

34:53.274 --> 34:56.824
How'd you know what I
like to drink, Gibbs?

34:57.174 --> 35:03.444
My older brother gave me my first
bourbon, before I was even a teenager.

35:06.164 --> 35:09.324
He liked to mess with my head.

35:09.814 --> 35:12.414
My grandfather had a still.

35:13.824 --> 35:15.494
It blew up once...

35:15.524 --> 35:18.774
and he ran back inside
to rescue his sour mash.

35:19.284 --> 35:22.284
It is a living thing.

35:25.304 --> 35:27.144
It's safe to talk here?

35:27.174 --> 35:29.444
Safer than your house.

35:32.544 --> 35:36.040
It was a point of pride
with my brother, though.

35:36.064 --> 35:38.060
I never hit you, he'd say.

35:38.084 --> 35:41.104
Preferred psychological warfare.

35:42.864 --> 35:44.954
You're an only child, aren't you, Gibbs?

35:44.994 --> 35:46.824
The Corps.

35:48.654 --> 35:52.664
Strangers... become
brothers in a foxhole.

35:54.244 --> 35:56.640
That why you've been digging dirt?

35:56.664 --> 35:59.174
Trying to get closer to Leon?

36:00.334 --> 36:02.684
No.

36:04.154 --> 36:07.120
I never asked for this.

36:07.144 --> 36:09.364
Never opened it.

36:14.494 --> 36:16.534
Well...

36:16.574 --> 36:20.674
let's see what the
CIA's got on Leon Vance.

36:26.304 --> 36:29.014
I thought we shredded all these.

36:29.714 --> 36:32.750
How does this thing keep
finding its way into the open?

36:32.774 --> 36:35.194
It's not even real.

36:36.384 --> 36:38.630
Lucky you didn't read this.

36:38.654 --> 36:41.424
Wouldn't give you the
whole picture anyway.

36:43.644 --> 36:46.154
And you will?

36:46.614 --> 36:48.260
- Is that Tabal's laptop?
- Yeah.

36:48.284 --> 36:52.214
Before Tabal killed himself, he
wiped all the sensitive information.

36:52.294 --> 36:54.194
Oh, so there's nothing
useful on it, huh?

36:54.234 --> 36:57.784
He did fail to erase the
laptop's network location memory.

36:57.824 --> 37:00.834
It's a log that records all
previous network connections,

37:00.874 --> 37:03.690
so you can access them
easily in the future.

37:03.714 --> 37:06.440
All that's going to tell us is
where he's used the Internet before.

37:06.464 --> 37:08.784
Bring that up.

37:11.334 --> 37:14.724
- I know that address.
- Yeah. Me, too.

37:15.844 --> 37:18.144
It's Ziva's.

37:30.524 --> 37:33.910
Lot of black bars
covering Leon's career.

37:33.934 --> 37:37.304
Man was born for counterintelligence.

37:38.644 --> 37:41.404
You didn't peg him for
a lifelong bureaucrat...

37:42.754 --> 37:45.554
Nah. Figured he'd worn a few hats.

37:46.674 --> 37:49.124
Heard a whisper or two.

37:49.984 --> 37:53.460
There's not a second of his
life I can't account for.

37:53.484 --> 37:57.430
I might hit him with a stick
every now and then, but, uh,

37:57.454 --> 38:01.854
I did not leave him out of that
poker game because I don't trust him.

38:02.974 --> 38:05.064
You were discussing how to use him.

38:07.174 --> 38:08.924
Yeah, I know.

38:08.964 --> 38:11.780
Since Director Shepard's death,

38:11.804 --> 38:18.010
you've been concerned with the danger
in having the wrong person at the top.

38:18.034 --> 38:20.574
Well, you're not alone.

38:20.964 --> 38:25.034
You're not the only one looking
out for the integrity of NCIS.

38:28.734 --> 38:32.144
Leon's going to be point
man in a major operation.

38:33.894 --> 38:37.634
- Who's the enemy?
- That's the problem. It's our friends.

38:39.164 --> 38:41.634
The Israelis. Top priority.

38:41.934 --> 38:47.724
Ever since Shepard created that
unorthodox position of "liaison officer."

38:50.864 --> 38:53.524
You're talking about Ziva David.

38:53.554 --> 38:58.184
Father's the director of Mossad,
half-brother was a rogue operative.

38:59.074 --> 39:02.994
He died in this room,
didn't he? At your hand.

39:05.904 --> 39:08.914
And she works with you every day.

39:12.524 --> 39:15.294
What a family.

39:17.344 --> 39:19.884
Ziva, it's Tony.

39:27.024 --> 39:29.024
You're here.

39:29.054 --> 39:30.524
Ziva is not.

39:30.564 --> 39:32.320
She'll be back soon.

39:32.344 --> 39:34.834
You're welcome to come
in and wait for her.

39:39.884 --> 39:43.564
Did you really expect me to
leave her because you threaten me?

39:44.564 --> 39:46.484
I had my hopes.

39:46.524 --> 39:50.304
Did they include you
coming here late at night?

39:50.334 --> 39:53.384
Maybe finding Ziva
in an emotional state?

39:53.424 --> 39:56.360
You help her pick up the pieces?

39:56.384 --> 39:57.814
I'm here about a case.

39:57.854 --> 39:59.844
An American agent was killed last night.

39:59.894 --> 40:03.414
All the evidence points to
a terrorist named Abin Tabal.

40:03.444 --> 40:06.204
I think you're familiar with him.

40:07.334 --> 40:11.060
Of course... he killed himself
before we could catch up to him.

40:11.084 --> 40:13.684
- Zealot.
- That's the theory.

40:14.144 --> 40:15.804
It's a little too clean for me.

40:15.844 --> 40:17.544
Does not sound clean at all.

40:17.594 --> 40:19.754
Sounds like the further you
dig, the messier it gets.

40:19.794 --> 40:21.194
Well, what can I say?

40:21.224 --> 40:24.694
The events of the past year
have made me a little suspicious.

40:24.724 --> 40:26.254
Even to the people closest to you?

40:26.304 --> 40:28.114
Oh, especially them.

40:28.144 --> 40:30.614
We pulled information
from Tabal's computer.

40:30.654 --> 40:35.694
Says that, at some point, the
internet was connected here.

40:36.504 --> 40:37.714
Ziva's account.

40:37.744 --> 40:40.080
She is tied to this dead man?

40:40.104 --> 40:41.864
Who is obviously duplicitous.

40:41.894 --> 40:43.644
Practiced in the art of misinformation.

40:43.674 --> 40:46.020
That appears to be the shape of things.

40:46.044 --> 40:48.744
You're here to question Ziva?

40:49.164 --> 40:52.460
All because a series of numbers
on a terrorist's computer?

40:52.484 --> 40:54.214
I was.

40:54.244 --> 40:56.854
Until you opened the door.

40:58.804 --> 41:01.264
Semper Fi.

41:06.574 --> 41:09.484
You and Leon gotta play nice.

41:12.654 --> 41:15.240
You ordering me to trust him?

41:15.264 --> 41:17.644
Just to follow him.

41:19.854 --> 41:22.964
We don't hit our brothers.

41:26.554 --> 41:28.724
Soon as you're done
with your drink, Michael,

41:28.754 --> 41:34.650
you're under arrest for the murders of
Abin Tabal and Federal Agent Tom Sherman.

41:34.674 --> 41:37.284
Good luck with that.

42:20.384 --> 42:22.304
Enough!

42:29.594 --> 42:31.830
- Don't do it.
- No.

42:31.854 --> 42:33.424
Don't!
