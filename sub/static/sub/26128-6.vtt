WEBVTT

00:02.586 --> 00:04.338
Gah!
Now?

00:04.505 --> 00:06.882
You want to know what happened
last week now?

00:07.049 --> 00:09.010
Jesus,
what are you, on drugs?

00:09.176 --> 00:11.554
Fuck, oh--ow, okay.

00:11.721 --> 00:13.305
I'll tell you
what happened last week.

00:13.472 --> 00:16.934
Call me a fucking lawyer,
that's what happened last week!

00:17.101 --> 00:18.811
Okay?
You got that?

00:19.103 --> 00:21.272
You're making a big mistake!

00:21.439 --> 00:22.732
You're looking
at the future site

00:22.898 --> 00:24.984
of Sunset Brooks Senior Care,
phase two.

00:25.151 --> 00:26.402
Is this the thing
Whitford sucked you into?

00:26.569 --> 00:28.029
Whitford didn't suck me
into anything.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.822
I invested
in a limited partnership.

00:29.989 --> 00:31.574
Ah, so you can only lose
all your investment,

00:31.741 --> 00:33.617
- which was how much again?
- $100,000.

00:35.286 --> 00:36.871
Why do you have two phones?

00:37.038 --> 00:39.790
It's for my mother.
It's an international phone.

00:39.957 --> 00:41.208
Your mother's Patty?

00:41.584 --> 00:43.335
- Patricia, yeah.
- Bullshit.

00:43.502 --> 00:44.336
You don't believe me?

00:45.129 --> 00:46.464
You want me to call her?

00:46.630 --> 00:48.340
<i>Hey, looking for Vicodin?</i>

00:49.175 --> 00:50.009
Always.

00:50.176 --> 00:51.594
Undo this belt,
and I'll--I'll get it.

00:51.761 --> 00:53.763
No, I don't think
I should do that.

00:53.929 --> 00:55.765
Oh, come on.

00:55.931 --> 00:58.100
You think I could actually
get out of here?

00:58.267 --> 01:00.686
Oh, God!

01:02.563 --> 01:03.773
Say you're sorry, Timmy!

01:03.939 --> 01:04.940
Say you're sorry!

01:11.906 --> 01:13.115
I set fire to a van,

01:13.282 --> 01:14.325
and in doing so, I turned

01:14.492 --> 01:16.243
what I intended
to be a movement of love

01:16.410 --> 01:17.787
into a movement of anger.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.622
<i>I was crazy to let it go
as far as I did.</i>

01:19.789 --> 01:20.831
<i>Truth is, I am bipolar.</i>

01:20.998 --> 01:22.917
I plead not guilty
by reason of insanity.

01:23.084 --> 01:24.627

Hey.
What you doing up there?

02:50.754 --> 02:52.631
Putting away my stuff
till I get back.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.049
Hand me those bags.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.177
You decide what you want
to do today yet?

02:56.343 --> 02:57.845
I could call in sick
from work.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.555
Well, I don't think
I want to do anything.

02:59.722 --> 03:00.973
Ah, come on,
we got to do something.

03:01.140 --> 03:02.391
It's your last day of freedom.

03:02.558 --> 03:04.059
Nah, I think I just want to

03:04.226 --> 03:05.519
hang at the house.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.188
You heading into
the shop today?

03:07.354 --> 03:08.981
I got a job
as a sober companion

03:09.148 --> 03:10.232
for the next couple hours.

03:10.399 --> 03:11.400
Hey, uh, how about we ride

03:11.567 --> 03:12.902
the El up to Wrigley
when I get back?

03:13.068 --> 03:14.570
Beat the shit
out of some Cubs fans?

03:14.737 --> 03:16.655
Yeah, I don't need more time
added to my sentence.

03:16.822 --> 03:18.616
What's a sober companion?

03:18.782 --> 03:20.659
I'm babysitting
some rich lush,

03:20.826 --> 03:22.077
making sure they don't drink.

03:22.661 --> 03:26.540
Anybody who can't stop drinking
on his own is a pussy.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.751
We could take you
to a gay bar and get you laid.

03:28.918 --> 03:31.086
Pretty sure I'll get laid
a lot in prison.

03:31.295 --> 03:32.671
Yo, what are we doing today?

03:32.838 --> 03:34.256
My new lady and I
are supposed to go

03:34.423 --> 03:36.091
<i>work out,
but I could cancel it.</i>

03:36.258 --> 03:37.176
<i>He doesn't want
to do anything.</i>

03:37.343 --> 03:39.094
What?
You don't want to steal a car,

03:39.261 --> 03:41.388
or drop bowling balls
off a freeway?

03:42.097 --> 03:43.307
I'm good.

03:45.059 --> 03:46.894
Liam, get your ass up.
Need help.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.313
What's up, Frank?

03:50.564 --> 03:51.565
Met a woman.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.150
Crazy as a loon,

03:53.317 --> 03:54.902
made my heart stir

03:55.069 --> 03:56.445
and my loins moist.

03:56.612 --> 03:57.446
Ew.

03:57.613 --> 03:59.365
She's on a 72-hour

03:59.531 --> 04:00.991
eval at the psych ward.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.369
Her name is Ingrid Jones.

04:03.786 --> 04:05.079
Want your opinion of her.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.956
- Why me?
<i>- 'Cause,</i>

04:07.456 --> 04:09.500
you're the only little kid left
who still needs a mommy.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.293
Rest of them
are already cooked.

04:11.460 --> 04:12.795
Can't.
Gotta hang with Ian.

04:12.962 --> 04:14.255
Seriously, guys, I'm good.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.506
I just want to veg
at the house,

04:15.673 --> 04:17.383
eat a shit-ton
of White Castle for dinner.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.678
I spent many a day
in prison.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.596
It's a walk in the park.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.015
Three squares a day,
lots of friends,

04:25.182 --> 04:28.018
free gym membership,
and all the books you can read.

04:28.227 --> 04:30.271
I suggest <i>Ulysses.</i>

04:30.437 --> 04:31.188
Shall we?

04:32.815 --> 04:34.608
No, go.
Go.

04:35.985 --> 04:37.653
See you later, Taraji.

04:39.822 --> 04:41.573
<i>Liam!</i>

04:44.201 --> 04:45.035
Hey, uh,

04:45.244 --> 04:46.537
how come you don't want
to do anything?

04:46.704 --> 04:48.330
I'm about to spend
the next two years of my life

04:48.497 --> 04:49.498
in fight-or-flight mode.

04:49.665 --> 04:50.624
I just want one last day

04:50.791 --> 04:53.168
where I feel safe and relaxed.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.170
Oh, okay.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.297
Sure?

04:56.505 --> 04:57.339
Yep.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.925
I guess I'll go to work then.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.802
I'll be back for dinner,
all right?

05:01.969 --> 05:04.430
- Yeah, see you at dinner.
- Okay.

05:18.652 --> 05:19.778
Have you seen
these inglenooks

05:19.945 --> 05:20.863
and these lead windows?

05:21.030 --> 05:22.364
Did you see
the second bathroom?

05:22.531 --> 05:23.699
We could each have our own.

05:23.866 --> 05:25.075
Dibs on the
black-and-green-tile one.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.535
What's the rent?

05:26.702 --> 05:28.162
It's $3,000 a month.

05:29.288 --> 05:29.997
That's crazy.

05:30.164 --> 05:31.332
- We can't afford that.
- Sure we can.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.791
You're gonna get
at least 1,000 bucks for

05:32.958 --> 05:35.336
renting your place,
and I'll cover the rest.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.254
No, then it'll feel like
it's your apartment

05:37.421 --> 05:39.089
that I'm just
tippy-toeing around in.

05:39.256 --> 05:41.925
Well, you can rustle up an
extra 500 bucks a month, then.

05:42.301 --> 05:43.052
Maybe.

05:43.218 --> 05:44.094
Come on, you're gonna be loaded

05:44.261 --> 05:45.554
off that senior center soon.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.639
Can we look
for something cheaper?

05:47.890 --> 05:49.641
This place
has southern exposure.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.393
I don't even know
why that's a good thing.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.728
It means this
whole place will be

05:52.895 --> 05:54.813
shit-tons of sunny
in the winter.

05:54.980 --> 05:55.939
Can we think about it?

05:56.106 --> 05:58.400
I got a meeting
with Max right now anyway.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.402
We'll let you know.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.029
Okay, um, sure.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.238
I can't guarantee

06:03.405 --> 06:04.740
<i>it'll still be available,
though.</i>

06:04.907 --> 06:06.158
Come here.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.290
Mm.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.292
I thought we were ready to take

06:15.459 --> 06:16.919
this relationship
to the next level.

06:17.086 --> 06:19.838
I just didn't realize
that would be so expensive.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.799
Well, to get ahead in life,
you have to push past

06:21.965 --> 06:23.342
your comfort zone.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.722
Okay.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.265
- Yeah?
- Let's do it.

06:30.432 --> 06:31.433
Great.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.152
Ah!
Ah!

06:47.825 --> 06:49.618
- What are you guys doing?
- Survival training.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.620
Kelly has a black belt
in krav maga.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.122
She's teaching me some moves.

06:53.539 --> 06:54.289
All right.

06:54.456 --> 06:55.874
Survival training, huh?

06:58.877 --> 06:59.753
Yeah.
Ooh!

07:00.087 --> 07:00.796
Ah!

07:02.131 --> 07:03.298
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.510
You know what, can you
guys show me some moves?

07:07.344 --> 07:08.804
- Sure.
- Okay.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.477
Oh.

07:16.979 --> 07:18.188
Go.

07:18.689 --> 07:19.565
Go!

07:19.731 --> 07:21.692
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

07:21.859 --> 07:22.901
Hey, man,
thanks for covering for me.

07:23.068 --> 07:23.986
Yeah, yeah, of course.

07:24.153 --> 07:26.155
- Client's in the room now.
- Okay.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.698
Hey, took an Ambien.

07:27.865 --> 07:30.033
She'll probably be asleep
till tonight.

07:30.284 --> 07:30.993
Great, yeah.

07:31.160 --> 07:31.827
She got a stockholders'

07:31.994 --> 07:33.036
meeting in the morning

07:33.203 --> 07:34.663
with Highland Cosmetics.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.332
She's their keynote speaker,
Jen Wagner.

07:37.499 --> 07:38.876
If she shows up hammered,

07:39.042 --> 07:41.170
the company's gonna drop her
as their spokesperson.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.464
You're talking about Jen
Wagner, the movie star chick?

07:43.630 --> 07:45.007
Yeah, that's the one.

07:45.174 --> 07:47.009
Uh, I didn't know
she was a boozer.

07:47.176 --> 07:48.886
Everybody got their demons,
right?

07:49.178 --> 07:50.554
- Yeah.
<i>- I should be back</i>

07:50.721 --> 07:52.139
<i>from dropping off my kid
at camp</i>

07:52.306 --> 07:53.891
around 5:00 to relieve you.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.350
All right.
Yeah-yeah, I got you.

07:55.517 --> 07:56.977
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.534
Why does <i>Paw Patrol</i>
only have one girl?

08:12.701 --> 08:14.369
Shh, I'm trying to watch.

08:14.536 --> 08:17.498
No job is too big.
No pup is too small.

08:20.709 --> 08:21.960
This cartoon is sexist.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.921
V, when I watch with the girls,

08:24.087 --> 08:25.714
we don't criticize
Ryder and his team.

08:25.881 --> 08:27.716
We just laugh and enjoy it.

08:31.303 --> 08:34.556
I've got something else
you can enjoy.

08:37.726 --> 08:38.727
See ya, <i>Paw Patrol.</i>

08:38.894 --> 08:40.395
Let's work off these donuts.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.231
I ate a lot of crullers.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.107
Mm-hmm.

08:45.567 --> 08:46.777
Who is that?

08:47.486 --> 08:48.487
Probably a Gallagher.

08:48.654 --> 08:49.655
Or a Jehovah.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.406
I'll get rid of them.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.372
Sister Frances.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.083
- Good morning.
- Good mor--

09:01.250 --> 09:02.876
please, won't you come in?

09:06.088 --> 09:08.048
Good morning.
Have a--have a seat.

09:09.841 --> 09:12.261
Amy brought this in
for show-and-tell today.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.891
That's weird.

09:18.976 --> 09:20.143
I wonder where
she got it from.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.770
The children were supposed
to bring in something

09:21.937 --> 09:24.606
that represents their
parents' love for each other.

09:24.773 --> 09:27.609
<i>Most brought in hearts
or pictures of their siblings.</i>

09:27.776 --> 09:29.278
Amy brought this.

09:31.488 --> 09:32.364
I'm so sorry.

09:32.531 --> 09:33.699
It'll never happen again.

09:38.287 --> 09:39.288
It's double-click.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.001
In order for Amy to return
back to school on Monday,

09:44.167 --> 09:45.836
Father D'Amico has requested

09:46.003 --> 09:48.297
that you come to his office
today and speak with him.

09:48.463 --> 09:49.881
You're gonna kick her out
because of this?

09:50.048 --> 09:51.675
We would love
to speak with the priest.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.052
My wife and I just need
to say our morning prayers,

09:54.219 --> 09:55.304
and then we'll meet you
at the rectory.

09:55.470 --> 09:56.513
I can take that--
or you can

09:56.680 --> 09:58.265
keep it as a parting gift.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.310
Thank you, Sister Frances,
for coming.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.316
Hey, Fiona!

10:07.482 --> 10:09.276
- Hello.
- Hi.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.819
Everybody, this is Fiona.

10:10.986 --> 10:13.030
This is Gil, Jessica,
and Sandy.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.323
- Hello.
- Hey, how's it going?

10:14.489 --> 10:15.824
- Hi.
<i>- Please, sit down.</i>

10:15.991 --> 10:17.826
So, what did
the hearing board say

10:17.993 --> 10:19.369
about the Sunset Brook
project?

10:19.536 --> 10:21.204
They denied our request
on rezoning.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.497
- Mm.
- What?

10:22.664 --> 10:24.791
Yeah, well,
we expected that.

10:25.167 --> 10:26.877
I did not expect that.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.170
<i>What were they
asking for?</i>

10:28.337 --> 10:29.880
Traffic and
environmental impact report?

10:30.047 --> 10:30.881
Oh, of course.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.883
City's gonna try
to force us to do street

10:33.050 --> 10:35.385
and sewer upgrades,
plus, there was a gas station

10:35.552 --> 10:36.845
on that corner in the '20s,

10:37.012 --> 10:38.680
so they want to see
what's underneath,

10:38.847 --> 10:40.307
and we gotta pay for it.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.517
Usual bureaucratic bullshit.

10:42.684 --> 10:43.852
So if they don't rezone,

10:44.019 --> 10:45.520
can the old age home
still go in there?

10:45.687 --> 10:47.522
Of course.
It'll just take longer.

10:47.689 --> 10:48.565
How much longer?

10:48.732 --> 10:49.858
A year or so, most likely.

10:50.609 --> 10:51.860
<i>You know, I've been using
Hilford and Carson to get</i>

10:52.027 --> 10:53.403
reports on my Glendale project.

10:53.570 --> 10:54.404
Sounds good to me.

10:54.571 --> 10:55.614
How much are they?

10:55.781 --> 10:56.698
We can probably get
all the reports

10:56.865 --> 10:59.159
done that we need for about

10:59.326 --> 11:01.328
$100,000, so 20 grand apiece.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.872
<i>Hm.
You cool with PayPal?</i>

11:04.039 --> 11:05.957
- Of course.
<i>- I'll write you a check.</i>

11:07.709 --> 11:09.544
I don't think I have
my checkbook with me.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.089
Ah, just get it to me
later today or tomorrow.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.674
Sure, yeah.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.342
So it's probably
time for us to talk

11:15.509 --> 11:16.593
about hiring a lawyer, too.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.553
I can talk to this guy I know,

11:18.720 --> 11:20.097
put him on a retainer.
Um.

11:20.222 --> 11:22.349
should cost us
about $5,000 each.

11:22.516 --> 11:23.892
<i>Nice. Yeah.</i>

11:24.059 --> 11:25.143
Great.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.783
Oh, look at that,
someone got

11:39.950 --> 11:41.410
some pretty balloons!

11:41.576 --> 11:43.078
The hell?

11:43.245 --> 11:45.997
You can't visit
the mentally ill empty-handed.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.127
Hey, Baxter,
what's shaking?

11:50.335 --> 11:51.128
Frankie!

11:51.294 --> 11:53.004
- Hey.
- Wow.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.339
Long time.

11:54.798 --> 11:57.592
That's because my Monica died.

11:57.843 --> 11:59.428
- No.
- Yeah.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.638
I am so sorry, buddy.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.140
Thanks,

12:03.306 --> 12:05.267
but it's gonna be okay.

12:05.434 --> 12:06.435
Got a new lady.

12:06.601 --> 12:07.894
<i>Hey, good for you.</i>

12:08.061 --> 12:10.063
And by my calculations,

12:10.397 --> 12:13.400
she should be finishing up
her 72 hours today.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.485
So my son and I are just gonna

12:15.652 --> 12:17.946
hunker down
until she gets released.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.823
Wait, this is Liam?

12:19.990 --> 12:21.116
Yep.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.118
<i>Wow.
Last time I saw you,</i>

12:23.285 --> 12:25.120
<i>you must have been
two years old,</i>

12:25.287 --> 12:26.872
<i>just talking up a storm.</i>

12:27.038 --> 12:27.873
Oh, yeah?

12:28.039 --> 12:28.874
Yeah.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.625
Hey, listen.

12:31.084 --> 12:31.793
I remember

12:31.960 --> 12:35.297
<i>your mom's face just
always lit up</i>

12:35.464 --> 12:36.673
every time she saw you

12:36.840 --> 12:38.341
when she got released
from here.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.302
Sure it wasn't the Thorazine?

12:41.011 --> 12:43.305
Hey, Baxter,
could I get the, uh, remote?

12:43.722 --> 12:44.681
Yeah.

13:07.329 --> 13:08.663
Oh, hey.

13:08.830 --> 13:09.831
Hi.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.333
Hey, are you going somewhere?

13:11.917 --> 13:13.001
Who the hell are you?

13:13.168 --> 13:14.878
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm--I'm Lip.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.838
Um, Philip.

13:17.005 --> 13:19.382
Covering for Barney
for a couple hours.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.093
Excuse me?

13:23.929 --> 13:24.846

Bye.

16:13.264 --> 16:15.058
Hey, look, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

16:15.225 --> 16:17.018
- You gave me no choice.
- Get off me!

16:17.185 --> 16:19.187
Not until you promise
you're not gonna drink.

16:19.354 --> 16:21.022
Look, I'm not getting off you
until you promise!

16:21.189 --> 16:23.692
- No!
- This is my job!

16:23.858 --> 16:26.069
- To sit on top of me?
- To make sure you don't drink!

16:26.236 --> 16:27.445
Oh, my God,
I told you,

16:27.612 --> 16:28.697
it's no big deal.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.740
Yes, it is.
All right?

16:30.949 --> 16:32.409
Don't fuck up this gig
for me.

16:32.575 --> 16:33.868
My brother's going to prison
tomorrow.

16:34.035 --> 16:35.578
I need the money
for his commissary account.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.455
Are you trying to play
on my emotions?

16:37.664 --> 16:38.456
Is it working?

16:38.623 --> 16:40.208
No, because I don't have any!

16:40.375 --> 16:41.793
All right, well, then,
suck it up until Barney

16:41.960 --> 16:43.795
gets back at 5:00, all right?
He can deal with you.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.463
What am I supposed to do
if I'm not drinking?

16:45.630 --> 16:46.756
Just sit in the hotel room
all day,

16:46.923 --> 16:48.258
watching SpectraVision?

16:48.425 --> 16:49.801
Uh, we could hang out
here in the park.

16:49.968 --> 16:50.885
It's a beautiful day out.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.470
You are such a sap.

16:52.637 --> 16:54.723
Look, just relax, all right?

16:54.889 --> 16:56.391
Enjoy, and

16:56.683 --> 16:58.435
take it one moment
at a time, all right?

16:58.601 --> 17:00.895
Oh, jeez.
AA crap.

17:01.062 --> 17:02.647
All right, fine.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.399
We'll just hang out
in this stupid park.

17:04.566 --> 17:05.400
- All right.
<i>- Okay.</i>

17:05.567 --> 17:06.735
Now I'm gonna get off you,

17:06.901 --> 17:08.403
but I swear, if you run,

17:08.570 --> 17:10.030
I will tackle the fuck
out of you.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.573
You are so dramatic.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.075
Hey, look who's talking,
commercial actress chick.

17:14.242 --> 17:17.245
I'll have you know, I have
done 17 films and 4 TV shows.

17:17.412 --> 17:18.496
Whatever.

17:19.956 --> 17:20.623
Hey!

17:20.790 --> 17:22.876
I'm just kidding,
you little shit.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.813
What are you doing?

17:43.980 --> 17:45.440
Packing for our move.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.110
I'm having second thoughts.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.031
We paid a deposit.

17:53.364 --> 17:54.783
We'll just cancel the check.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.534
We signed a lease.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.496
The realtor won't care.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.874
She said tons of people
are interested, anyway.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.585
What's this about?

18:13.551 --> 18:16.221
To be honest,
I smelled mold in there.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.807
These old apartments,
they got so much water damage,

18:18.973 --> 18:21.101
and mold is so bad
for your lungs.

18:21.559 --> 18:24.604
Hm.
And where's this coming from?

18:24.938 --> 18:27.607
I just think we can find
something better and cheaper.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.320
What's your excuse gonna be
in the next apartment?

18:33.863 --> 18:34.656
Excuse me?

18:34.823 --> 18:35.740
You're not remotely serious
about

18:35.907 --> 18:36.825
us getting a place together.

18:36.991 --> 18:37.700
That is not true.

18:37.867 --> 18:38.701
Bullshit.

18:38.868 --> 18:39.869
I have a perfectly

18:40.036 --> 18:41.204
good apartment right here.

18:41.371 --> 18:42.247
Which is too small

18:42.413 --> 18:43.498
for me to move
any of my stuff into.

18:43.665 --> 18:44.833
It's not the right time for me

18:44.999 --> 18:46.251
to be spending
that kind of money.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.252
Well, let me know
when it is the right time,

18:47.418 --> 18:48.670
and maybe,
I might still be around.

18:48.837 --> 18:50.421
Where are you going?

18:50.922 --> 18:52.006
To cancel a check
and break a lease

18:52.173 --> 18:54.509
so God forbid, we don't have
to fucking live together.

18:58.930 --> 18:59.931
Yo, bitch.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.474
My cell, now.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.560
No way, Larry.
Ow.

19:03.726 --> 19:04.853
See, wrong move.

19:05.019 --> 19:06.146
You just got your throat slit.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.522
Ah!

19:09.691 --> 19:11.609
- And now you're dead.
- Shit.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.237
Dude, what the hell
did we teach you?

19:14.737 --> 19:16.364
Your ass gonna get fucked up
in prison.

19:16.531 --> 19:17.198
Run it again.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.412
My cell, bitch.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.038
<i>You don't roll
into the blade.</i>

19:24.372 --> 19:26.958
Use your left hand to grab
her wrist with the knife.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.669
<i>Grab her elbow,
then throw.</i>

19:35.216 --> 19:36.176
You good?

19:36.342 --> 19:37.260
Yeah.

19:43.057 --> 19:44.184
Yeah?

19:49.314 --> 19:50.231
Ian here?

19:50.398 --> 19:51.566
Who wants to know?

19:51.733 --> 19:53.067
My name's Antonio.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.777
Joselito sent me.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.779
Oh.
Yeah, I'm Ian.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.114
Come in.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.327
We talking
Joselito from County?

20:02.744 --> 20:04.245
How's he doing?

20:04.412 --> 20:07.540
Jackass got extra 20 years.
Stabbed a guard.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.584
That sucks.

20:10.627 --> 20:11.753
Uh, is he still with Leo?

20:11.920 --> 20:14.339
Nah, they broke up
after Leo got released.

20:14.505 --> 20:16.007
That long-distance shit
never works.

20:16.174 --> 20:17.592
So what's going on?

20:17.759 --> 20:19.177
Joselito wanted me
to give you an in-depth

20:19.344 --> 20:21.262
safety orientation
about Beckman Correctional

20:21.429 --> 20:22.639
before they send you up.

20:29.270 --> 20:30.271
Is that my Ingrid?

20:31.856 --> 20:33.858
No, it's just some crazy dude.

20:34.609 --> 20:35.485
What's so special about

20:35.652 --> 20:37.320
this chick we're waiting for,
anyway?

20:37.445 --> 20:40.615
Well, son,
it's a great gift in this life

20:40.782 --> 20:42.784
to know what you're good at.

20:42.951 --> 20:44.202
And, uh,

20:44.953 --> 20:46.663
I'm good at crazy.

20:47.205 --> 20:50.250
I'm a caretaker to it.
Makes me feel needed.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.168
It's how I felt
with your mother.

20:52.335 --> 20:56.172
Plus, it's never boring.
Look at this.

20:58.675 --> 20:59.968
What the hell is that?

21:00.134 --> 21:01.844
Monica.

21:02.011 --> 21:02.971
I was asleep.

21:03.137 --> 21:04.806
Decided she was gonna
light me on fire,

21:04.973 --> 21:07.016
one body part at a time.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.476
- Why?
<i>- Hard to say</i>

21:08.643 --> 21:09.686
<i>with a crazy person.</i>

21:09.852 --> 21:10.979
<i>That's the thrill.</i>

21:11.145 --> 21:12.272
You never know
what you're gonna get,

21:12.438 --> 21:13.731
moment to moment.

21:13.898 --> 21:14.983
Thankfully,

21:15.483 --> 21:17.694
she passed out
before she could torch

21:17.860 --> 21:19.487
the rest of my body.

21:20.321 --> 21:22.699
I'd given up trying to find

21:22.865 --> 21:26.035
excitement like that again,
till now.

21:27.161 --> 21:30.290
<i>I'm gonna get some more
of those, um, fudge stripes,</i>

21:30.456 --> 21:31.958
and then I'll tell you
about the time Monica

21:32.125 --> 21:33.751
shattered my kneecap
with a pool cue.

21:33.918 --> 21:37.839
It was the best
sex of my life.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.343
That cloud up there
looks like a martini glass.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.804
Nah, it's clearly
a beer funnel.

21:47.265 --> 21:48.391
When did you start drinking?

21:48.683 --> 21:49.726
Nine?

21:51.144 --> 21:51.978
Maybe earlier.

21:52.395 --> 21:53.604
I was 12.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.858
We had a beer keg tapped
in our backyard at all times.

21:57.025 --> 21:58.609
Grow up in a fraternity?

21:59.694 --> 22:00.903
You ever try and stop?

22:01.237 --> 22:02.155
Course.

22:03.072 --> 22:03.906
Life's hard.

22:04.073 --> 22:06.034
<i>Booze is my only escape.</i>

22:06.200 --> 22:08.411
Why'd you hire
a sober companion, then?

22:09.746 --> 22:10.872
I didn't.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.041
Highland Cosmetics did
after the incident,

22:13.374 --> 22:15.084
<i>where we're doing this
Christmas commercial</i>

22:15.251 --> 22:17.128
in the fall,
and I was riding a horse

22:17.295 --> 22:19.213
through Central Park,
and I fell off.

22:19.464 --> 22:20.131
Drunk?

22:20.298 --> 22:22.925
I was plastered.

22:23.092 --> 22:24.218
Course, the horse got spooked

22:24.385 --> 22:25.803
and took off,
and guess what I did?

22:25.970 --> 22:27.805
Start chasing after him.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.223
- Sure.
- I was wearing high heels

22:29.390 --> 22:31.476
and this snow angel thing.

22:31.642 --> 22:34.395
Yeah. I almost caught it,
and I promise you,

22:34.562 --> 22:36.481
- I could've, had I not puked.
- Sure.

22:37.065 --> 22:38.024
I'm surprised
you didn't see it.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.692
It was all over the Internet.
You didn't see the gif?

22:39.859 --> 22:42.904
- No.
- The

22:43.071 --> 22:44.822
Aw, man.

22:45.656 --> 22:46.824
Oh.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.746
Let's go get some lunch.

22:51.913 --> 22:53.539
I'm fucking starving.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.584
Sure, yeah.

23:01.714 --> 23:04.300
Hey, Max.
You got a second?

23:04.467 --> 23:06.469
Yeah, what's up?
Late for a thing.

23:06.636 --> 23:08.721
- I need to get out of our deal.
- What?

23:09.555 --> 23:12.225
Another opportunity came up,
and I'm short on cash.

23:12.517 --> 23:14.102
What other opportunity?

23:14.268 --> 23:16.187
Is it something
I want to invest in?

23:16.354 --> 23:19.524
I'm not allowed to say,
but I gotta act fast.

23:19.690 --> 23:21.150
Are you kidding me?

23:21.317 --> 23:23.152
You bullied your way
onto my project,

23:23.319 --> 23:24.654
and I can't get in on yours?

23:24.821 --> 23:26.781
I'm sorry.
My hands are tied.

23:26.948 --> 23:28.825
So how can I get my money out of
the Sunset Brook project?

23:28.991 --> 23:31.494
You can't.
I mean, it's been invested.

23:31.661 --> 23:32.745
And the paperwork's
already been

23:32.912 --> 23:34.956
filed on the partnership, so...

23:35.123 --> 23:36.958
Well, I wasn't expecting
a 12-month delay

23:37.125 --> 23:38.418
on the senior center.

23:39.001 --> 23:40.169
None of us were.

23:40.962 --> 23:42.422
So what's the other thing?
You getting a better return?

23:42.588 --> 23:44.632
Is that, uh--
is that why you want to bail?

23:46.008 --> 23:46.968
Something like that.

23:47.135 --> 23:48.803
Jesus.

23:48.970 --> 23:50.304
You know, I thought
we had a good

23:50.471 --> 23:52.140
business thing going here.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.810
I scratch your back,
you scratch mine.

23:55.977 --> 23:57.812
See how you are, Gallagher.

23:57.979 --> 23:59.897
All right,
don't forget my 25K.

24:08.573 --> 24:11.200
So we have a little
sex toy obsession, do we?

24:11.367 --> 24:12.660
Obsession?
No, no, I would--

24:12.827 --> 24:14.120
I wouldn't say that at all.

24:14.287 --> 24:15.955
It's actually the only
sex toy we have, Father.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.665
Well, I'm sure you would
both agree that

24:17.832 --> 24:20.126
exposing Amy
to this kind of depravity

24:20.293 --> 24:21.627
is not in her best interest.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.045
With all due respect, Father,

24:23.212 --> 24:25.590
we're not exposing our daughter
to any depravity.

24:25.756 --> 24:26.674
<i>Need I remind you</i>

24:26.841 --> 24:28.217
that your daughter brought

24:28.384 --> 24:31.262
a massive, veiny,
vibrating dildo

24:31.429 --> 24:33.139
into preschool?

24:34.265 --> 24:36.476
<i>Now, you may
be asking yourselves how</i>

24:36.684 --> 24:38.352
a pious man like myself

24:38.519 --> 24:40.146
could have such
carnal knowledge

24:40.313 --> 24:43.232
of sexual fetishes
and addictions.

24:43.399 --> 24:45.151
Yeah, no,
we weren't asking that.

24:45.318 --> 24:46.944
I'm actually kind of curious.
Yeah?

24:47.111 --> 24:49.197
Well, prior to serving God,

24:49.363 --> 24:51.407
I was in
the United States Navy.

24:52.617 --> 24:54.535
You have no idea
what loneliness is

24:54.702 --> 24:56.537
until you're trapped
out at sea,

24:56.704 --> 24:59.540
away from home
for months at a time.

25:01.751 --> 25:03.920
I was at a low point in my life
as our ship

25:04.086 --> 25:06.047
pulled into Subic Bay.

25:06.214 --> 25:09.300
<i>Little did I know that my life
was about to spiral downward.</i>

25:09.467 --> 25:11.177
As we disembarked
from our ship,

25:11.344 --> 25:14.722
my fellow seamen and I
were greeted by the warm smiles

25:14.889 --> 25:16.432
of the Subic Bay women.

25:16.891 --> 25:19.185
<i>Let me tell you, a hug
from a Subic Bay woman</i>

25:19.352 --> 25:21.521
<i>can take away
all your loneliness,</i>

25:21.729 --> 25:24.315
especially from one woman,

25:24.899 --> 25:26.984
named Ming-hang.

25:27.485 --> 25:28.402
<i>Of course, I had to pay</i>

25:28.569 --> 25:30.905
<i>for her companionship,
but what's a few pesos</i>

25:31.072 --> 25:32.740
<i>when you're treated like a king
for an hour?</i>

25:32.907 --> 25:36.244
Or in my case, a few hours,
which turned into days,

25:36.410 --> 25:38.204
which turned into weeks,

25:38.371 --> 25:40.748
and then, eventually,
my going AWOL,

25:40.915 --> 25:41.958
<i>and being served</i>

25:42.124 --> 25:44.335
<i>a military warrant
for my arrest.</i>

25:46.837 --> 25:49.090
Is this $22
for a grilled cheese?

25:49.257 --> 25:51.300
Who cares?
Get what you want.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.803
I'm gonna splurge
and get the Cobb salad.

25:53.970 --> 25:54.971
Final answer.

25:55.137 --> 25:56.472
Oh, salad's splurging?

25:56.639 --> 25:57.765
It has creamy dressing.

25:57.932 --> 25:59.267
Oh.

26:00.434 --> 26:03.938
So what qualifies you
to be a sober companion?

26:04.272 --> 26:05.898
I don't know, really.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.817
I mean,
I've never done it before.

26:07.984 --> 26:08.901
Um.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.237
Barney trusts me, I guess,

26:11.404 --> 26:12.863
and I know
how a drunk thinks.

26:14.615 --> 26:16.784
Here we go.
Virgin Bloody Mary.

26:16.951 --> 26:18.452
Are you positive
it's virgin?

26:18.619 --> 26:21.122
It's absolutely, 100%,
a virgin.

26:21.289 --> 26:24.000
Uh, and
Coke for the gentleman.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.167
<i>Let me put
this tray down.</i>

26:25.334 --> 26:26.502
I'll be right back
to take your order.

26:26.669 --> 26:28.629
Kay.
This is, like, an entire salad

26:28.796 --> 26:30.131
- on my glass.
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

26:30.298 --> 26:32.425
Guess they have to make up
for it being a virgin.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.218
Oh, my God.

26:34.385 --> 26:36.137
Hey, you told Fred the waiter
that a virgin meant

26:36.304 --> 26:37.972
to make it a double
when I was in the bathroom.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.642
Fuck, I miss Barney.

26:42.727 --> 26:43.811
Sh...

26:43.978 --> 26:45.730
Jesus Christ.

26:49.066 --> 26:50.860
<i>Anyway,
at first, Ming-hang and I</i>

26:51.027 --> 26:53.863
just talked and made love.

26:54.030 --> 26:56.907
Then she introduced me to
something called the Hot Carl.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.159
Do you know
what the Hot Carl is?

26:58.326 --> 26:59.994
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- We got it.

27:00.161 --> 27:02.371
<i>That quickly
led to the Dirty Sanchez,</i>

27:02.538 --> 27:03.831
<i>and then the gorilla mask.</i>

27:03.998 --> 27:05.708
It got to the point
where I couldn't orgasm

27:05.875 --> 27:08.336
unless I was doing
the Alabama Hot Pocket.

27:10.504 --> 27:11.464
Oh, that's when you defecate--

27:11.631 --> 27:13.341
Nope, Father.
Too far.

27:13.507 --> 27:14.842
Oh, you're gonna stop him now?

27:15.009 --> 27:17.845
Anyway, the next time
you reach for that dildo,

27:18.012 --> 27:19.764
or that butt plug,
or that ball gag,

27:19.930 --> 27:21.098
you remember me,

27:21.265 --> 27:22.892
<i>an innocent seaman</i>

27:23.059 --> 27:24.685
<i>just trying to serve his country</i>

27:24.852 --> 27:27.688
while getting choked out
to the point of asphyxiation

27:27.855 --> 27:29.982
by a Subic Bay woman named...

27:30.149 --> 27:32.568
Ming-hang.

27:33.569 --> 27:34.695
Father, our penance.

27:34.862 --> 27:36.238
Oh, yes, right.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.699
Um, say four Hail Marys

27:38.866 --> 27:40.201
and six Our Fathers.

27:41.410 --> 27:42.411
Thank you.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.636
Okay.

27:58.969 --> 28:01.222
- I just need your license.
- Sure.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.142
Thank you.

28:08.187 --> 28:11.357
I see that you already have
two mortgage loans with us.

28:11.524 --> 28:12.650
Yes.
How long would it take

28:12.817 --> 28:14.276
to get more money
against my property?

28:14.902 --> 28:17.738
- How much were you looking for?
- $25,000.

28:17.905 --> 28:20.074
<i>Well, we would have to start
the whole approval process again</i>

28:20.241 --> 28:21.951
<i>and run a new credit check.</i>

28:22.118 --> 28:24.120
We would need copies of
your tax returns for the last

28:24.286 --> 28:26.831
two years, pay stubs
for the last three months.

28:26.997 --> 28:28.624
<i>Then we'll review
all of your bank statements,</i>

28:28.791 --> 28:30.918
<i>just to ensure that you
can complete the payments.</i>

28:31.085 --> 28:32.420
After we have everything
we need,

28:32.586 --> 28:33.504
it usually
takes the underwriter

28:33.671 --> 28:35.715
about six weeks to approve.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.717
Six weeks?

28:38.718 --> 28:40.094
I need the money immediately.

28:40.261 --> 28:41.804
Well, there is
an expedited procedure,

28:41.971 --> 28:43.139
but that will cost you 10%.

28:43.431 --> 28:44.932
- How expedited?
<i>- Ten days.</i>

28:45.099 --> 28:47.017
Do you want to start
the application process?

28:47.226 --> 28:47.935
Yes.

28:50.938 --> 28:51.856
Okay.

28:52.022 --> 28:53.524
So this is the layout

28:53.691 --> 28:55.276
of Beckman Correctional,
all right?

28:56.110 --> 28:57.319
This is the area
you want to avoid.

28:57.486 --> 28:59.155
Anything on the west side,

28:59.321 --> 29:01.532
the showers,
this side of the yard,

29:01.699 --> 29:02.950
<i>and these cells.</i>

29:03.117 --> 29:04.744
That is a lot of area
I'm avoiding.

29:04.910 --> 29:05.786
You'll thank me later.

29:05.953 --> 29:06.954
All the inmates over here

29:07.121 --> 29:09.290
are murderers.
Murderer,

29:09.457 --> 29:11.959
murderer, murderer.

29:12.168 --> 29:12.877
Jesus.

29:13.544 --> 29:14.879
So this

29:15.171 --> 29:17.465
is the primo area at Beckman.

29:17.631 --> 29:19.008
All right?
I'm talking about

29:19.175 --> 29:21.093
Disney compared
to that shit over there.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.095
<i>So over here, you'll
get your good weed,</i>

29:23.262 --> 29:25.723
your coke, your smoke,
and your Snicker bars.

29:25.890 --> 29:27.099
Anything you need.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.809
Assume that anything
you get from the west

29:28.976 --> 29:29.977
is gonna be laced
with some shit

29:30.144 --> 29:30.978
that's gonna fucking kill you.

29:31.145 --> 29:32.229
Got it.

29:32.396 --> 29:33.773
Now, back in Disney,

29:33.939 --> 29:35.316
<i>is where you'll find the guys</i>

29:35.483 --> 29:37.443
that give the best blowies.

29:37.610 --> 29:39.320
All right?
There's Ralphie.

29:39.737 --> 29:41.655
Clean, quick, easy.

29:41.822 --> 29:43.157
Old Man Stewie?

29:43.324 --> 29:45.493
<i>He's good.
The Senator.</i>

29:45.659 --> 29:46.660
Oh, and Sasquatch.

29:46.827 --> 29:48.120
I don't know
if he's still there.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.538
Big Pete, Medium Pete.

29:49.663 --> 29:50.664
All good.

29:50.831 --> 29:52.208
- Okay.
<i>- Hi.</i>

29:52.374 --> 29:54.460
Anybody got any cash?
I need $25,000.

29:54.627 --> 29:55.836
What?
For what?

29:56.003 --> 29:58.547
I gotta put more money into
this investment that I made.

29:58.714 --> 29:59.840
What investment?

30:00.007 --> 30:01.258
I put $100,000 into a

30:01.425 --> 30:02.802
parking lot
that's gonna be--

30:02.968 --> 30:04.261
You got 100 grand?

30:04.428 --> 30:06.263
No, the--the bank gave me
a line

30:06.430 --> 30:07.932
of credit against
my apartment building.

30:08.098 --> 30:09.016
That's just dumb.

30:09.183 --> 30:10.559
Don't pay it back.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.228
No, then they'll take
the building.

30:12.394 --> 30:13.896
You could try
to sell something.

30:14.063 --> 30:14.897
What about your car?

30:15.064 --> 30:16.023
It's a lease.

30:16.690 --> 30:18.025
I can do you a solid.

30:19.652 --> 30:20.361
Who are you?

30:20.528 --> 30:21.362
<i>Antonio.</i>

30:21.529 --> 30:23.030
He's a friend.

30:23.197 --> 30:25.032
<i>Pleasure.</i>
I know some guys

30:25.199 --> 30:28.911
that know some guys,
get you 25 grand, take a cut.

30:34.959 --> 30:36.001
I'm good.

30:36.210 --> 30:37.837
I think I figured it out.
Thanks.

30:38.838 --> 30:39.547
Don't forget,

30:39.713 --> 30:41.257
I'm driving you
to prison in the morning.

30:42.132 --> 30:44.051
<i>Okay.</i>

30:44.218 --> 30:47.847
Why is my sobriety
so important to you anyway?

30:48.013 --> 30:50.099
It's not.
My sobriety is important to me.

30:50.266 --> 30:51.684
That makes no sense.

30:52.226 --> 30:53.978
Look, if I help you stay sober,

30:54.144 --> 30:55.563
it helps me stay sober.

30:55.729 --> 30:57.064
So narcissistic.

31:00.693 --> 31:02.444
What if I let you touch these?

31:02.987 --> 31:04.738
This is Highland.
This is Cosmetics.

31:04.905 --> 31:08.075
It's nice to meet you, ladies,
but I'm--I'm not interested.

31:13.581 --> 31:15.457
- Shit.
- What?

31:15.624 --> 31:17.459
Barney's gonna be
a couple hours late.

31:17.626 --> 31:18.794
Are you kidding me?

31:19.044 --> 31:21.589
Look, um, I've got my brother's
last dinner, all right?

31:21.755 --> 31:22.923
So your ass
is coming with me.

31:23.090 --> 31:25.593
Fuck that.
I am going to the bar.

31:27.094 --> 31:28.429
Jesus.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.267
Two Flaming Dr. Peppers,
please.

31:33.434 --> 31:34.685
You got it.

31:36.770 --> 31:37.438
What are you doing?

31:37.605 --> 31:38.731
Ordering us cocktails.

31:39.023 --> 31:39.940
Hey, she doesn't want those.

31:40.107 --> 31:41.191
Yes, she does.

31:41.358 --> 31:43.444
Well, I'm not gonna
let you do this.

31:43.777 --> 31:45.613
You're such a buzzkill.

31:45.779 --> 31:48.699
It's only alcohol.
Stop giving it so much power.

31:48.866 --> 31:51.160
It's like flavored water,
for God's sake.

31:51.702 --> 31:53.037
Booyah!

31:55.539 --> 31:56.790
That's what I'm talking about.

31:56.957 --> 31:58.334
Thank you.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.336
Here you go.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.796
Come on, take it, you wuss.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.257
Hm.

32:05.424 --> 32:06.842
Please don't drink that.

32:07.009 --> 32:09.720
Douche-canoe,
I'm a grown-ass woman.

32:09.887 --> 32:11.680
If I want to drink it,
I'm gonna drink it.

32:12.097 --> 32:14.642
Hey, everybody, look,
it's Jen Wagner, right here!

32:14.892 --> 32:15.643
Look!

32:16.977 --> 32:18.854
Hi.
Hi.

32:20.230 --> 32:21.482
You asshole.
Hi.

32:26.737 --> 32:28.656
I don't think
you're gonna qualify.

32:30.157 --> 32:31.075
What?

32:31.241 --> 32:33.494
Uh, yeah, you don't have
enough revenue

32:33.661 --> 32:35.371
to carry a third loan.

32:35.537 --> 32:36.830
Do you have
any additional assets,

32:36.997 --> 32:38.666
bonds, stocks?

32:40.292 --> 32:41.085
No.

32:42.086 --> 32:43.963
Sorry.
I can go ahead and push

32:44.129 --> 32:45.673
this expedited application
through

32:45.839 --> 32:47.675
<i>and we'll see
what the underwriter says, but</i>

32:47.841 --> 32:50.344
<i>I don't think
you're gonna get approved.</i>

32:57.559 --> 32:58.894
Ah.

32:59.728 --> 33:01.021
<i>You think this stuff
makes us depraved?</i>

33:01.188 --> 33:02.481
Fuck, no.

33:02.815 --> 33:04.358
Yeah, but the priest
said that we're--

33:04.525 --> 33:05.651
Well, it's his job, Kev,

33:05.818 --> 33:07.027
to make us feel like shit

33:07.194 --> 33:08.195
about having a healthy sex life

33:08.362 --> 33:09.863
because he can't anymore.

33:10.030 --> 33:13.367
When is the last time we used
any of this stuff, anyway?

33:15.327 --> 33:16.328
Like this butt plug?

33:16.495 --> 33:18.205
Watching the White Sox
double-header.

33:18.372 --> 33:20.749
Oh, yeah.

33:21.041 --> 33:22.418
The rain delay.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.421
We just need to be more careful
with the girls around.

33:25.587 --> 33:26.922
I don't want them walking
in on us

33:27.089 --> 33:29.258
using any of this anytime soon.

33:29.425 --> 33:31.093
It'll probably just fall out,
anyway.

33:31.260 --> 33:32.219
Excuse me?

33:32.386 --> 33:34.722
Of me.
It'll fall out of me.

33:38.726 --> 33:40.060
Let's just throw it all out.

33:40.269 --> 33:41.437
Hell, no.

33:42.896 --> 33:44.773
We're gonna have a ceremony,

33:45.941 --> 33:47.735
a proper good-bye.

33:51.864 --> 33:52.906
Hey, Fiona,
can you take the Sprite

33:53.073 --> 33:54.324
off this check for me, please?

33:54.491 --> 33:56.910
Um, just, um,
comp the whole thing.

34:30.277 --> 34:31.111
Fuck.

34:31.278 --> 34:33.447
- Knock, knock.
- What?

34:33.697 --> 34:34.907
Sorry to interrupt, boss.

34:35.324 --> 34:36.450
It's Linus' birthday.

34:36.617 --> 34:38.452
We're gonna have a few drinks
later if you want to join.

34:39.411 --> 34:40.204
Sure.

34:40.370 --> 34:41.538
Okay.

35:12.402 --> 35:13.737
Is that her?

35:14.655 --> 35:16.657
Stay here.
I'll go get your medications.

35:16.824 --> 35:18.117
Yeah, okay.

35:18.992 --> 35:20.452
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

35:20.619 --> 35:22.162
Looking good, Dr. Jones.

35:22.371 --> 35:23.497
Thanks, Baxter.

35:28.836 --> 35:30.921
Uh, Dr. Jones?

35:31.088 --> 35:32.756
Dr. Ingrid Jones?

35:33.006 --> 35:33.882
That's her?

35:34.049 --> 35:34.842
Yes?

35:35.634 --> 35:37.344
We met the other day
in the ER.

35:37.511 --> 35:39.680
You lured me in with Vicodin?

35:40.848 --> 35:42.641
Bitch-slapped me,
called me Timmy?

35:44.059 --> 35:46.895
You kissed me on behalf
of Sarah Beth?

35:50.149 --> 35:51.900
You must have
the wrong person.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.240
Baxter, tell Randy
I'll be in my car.

35:58.365 --> 35:59.700
Oh, but--uh--

35:59.867 --> 36:00.993
Um...

36:02.327 --> 36:04.955
She was so different
the other day.

36:05.122 --> 36:08.083
We really had a connection.
She's so normal now.

36:08.250 --> 36:09.418
Well, they're always that way
when they get released

36:09.585 --> 36:10.711
from here, Frank.
You know that.

36:10.878 --> 36:12.045
I guess it's been a while.

36:12.212 --> 36:13.672
That man she was with,
Randy?

36:14.381 --> 36:16.717
Yeah, her ex-husband.

36:17.050 --> 36:18.218
Good to know.

36:18.385 --> 36:20.262
W-w-what do you think?

36:20.429 --> 36:21.305
<i>I don't know.</i>

36:21.471 --> 36:23.432
Looks like she could shatter
your kneecap.

36:23.599 --> 36:25.684
She really does,
doesn't she?

36:25.934 --> 36:27.102
Come on.

36:30.230 --> 36:32.399
- <i>That's some bullshit!</i>
- Where's my shit, motherfucker?

36:32.566 --> 36:34.401
You didn't tell me we were
having dinner in the ghetto.

36:34.568 --> 36:35.944
Hey, you had me running
around the city all day.

36:36.111 --> 36:37.070
Least you could do
is hang here until

36:37.237 --> 36:38.614
Barney comes to pick you up.

36:38.780 --> 36:41.074
Hope I don't get mugged
in the meantime.

36:42.034 --> 36:43.160
Hurry up.

36:43.577 --> 36:45.621
You're gonna be late
for your gang initiation.

36:56.965 --> 36:59.259
There she is.

37:01.762 --> 37:03.430
- They're leaving.
- Shit.

37:08.769 --> 37:09.686
What?

37:10.979 --> 37:12.147
Frank, what about me?

37:12.314 --> 37:14.942
Uh, take the, uh,
number 16 bus.

37:18.111 --> 37:20.239
<i>Okay, wait, wait, wait,
wait, I have a better one.</i>

37:20.405 --> 37:22.491
So Carl's, like,
five or six years old, right?

37:22.658 --> 37:24.243
Enough with these
Carl stories.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.036
- Hey, let me get that.
- No way. I want more.

37:26.203 --> 37:27.162
Me too.

37:27.788 --> 37:29.623
Wow, looks like you're
the one going to prison.

37:29.790 --> 37:31.792
Mm, this is amazing.

37:31.959 --> 37:34.044
I can't believe you've never
had White Castle before.

37:34.211 --> 37:36.171
I only eat carrots, and then
I throw them up.

37:36.338 --> 37:38.465
Come on, tell the story.

37:38.632 --> 37:40.217
All right, so he's
five or six years old--

37:40.384 --> 37:41.969
Wait-wait-wait, is this
the penis or the cat story?

37:42.135 --> 37:43.595
- Penis.
<i>- Shit.</i>

37:43.762 --> 37:45.973
<i>And he thought pee
was stored in his scrotum.</i>

37:46.139 --> 37:48.058
- No.
- But he called it his...

37:48.225 --> 37:49.268
- Bubble gum.
- Yeah.

37:49.434 --> 37:50.477
'Cause it looks
like bubble gum.

37:50.644 --> 37:51.812
He took a screwdriver...

37:51.979 --> 37:53.730
- No!
- Yeah. Yep.

37:53.897 --> 37:55.315
- Is that what that scar is?
- Uh-huh.

37:55.482 --> 37:57.484
Well, and why the hell'd
you do that?

37:57.651 --> 37:59.486
I thought I'd save some time,
bypass the penis.

37:59.653 --> 38:00.487
Creative.

38:00.654 --> 38:01.989
See?
I'm a genius.

38:02.155 --> 38:03.282
Yeah, you're a genius.

38:03.448 --> 38:04.491
Did pee come out?

38:04.658 --> 38:05.701
It smelled like pee.

38:05.867 --> 38:07.411
- <i>Oh, God.</i>
- What a genius.

38:07.577 --> 38:09.538
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late.

38:09.705 --> 38:10.998
I got stuck on the El
for 20 minutes.

38:11.164 --> 38:12.040
- Nice.
- Hey, what's going on, Deb?

38:12.207 --> 38:13.208
Ooh.

38:14.710 --> 38:16.003
Yes.

38:16.795 --> 38:19.631
<i>- Was it two?
- Was it?</i>

38:19.798 --> 38:21.633
Why is that chick
from those makeup commercials

38:21.800 --> 38:23.051
having dinner with us?

38:24.511 --> 38:25.637
Oh, shit, that's you.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.514
- Mm.
- Hey, she's also done

38:27.681 --> 38:30.309
17 movies and 4 TV shows.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.060
And nominated
for three Golden Globes

38:32.227 --> 38:33.353
- and a People's Choice Award.
- Whoa.

38:33.520 --> 38:34.354
You're famous.

38:34.521 --> 38:35.397
You make a lot of money

38:35.564 --> 38:36.565
doing those commercials, huh?

38:36.982 --> 38:37.649
Hey.

38:37.816 --> 38:38.650
What?

38:38.817 --> 38:39.985
Say the line.

38:40.152 --> 38:41.987
- No.
<i>- Oh, you guys,</i>

38:42.154 --> 38:43.697
<i>come on, come on, come on.</i>

38:43.864 --> 38:44.865
Come on.

38:45.032 --> 38:46.199
Come on.

38:50.329 --> 38:52.205
Face it.
You're gorgeous.

38:52.372 --> 38:53.373
Wow.

38:53.540 --> 38:54.791
Whoo, whoo!

38:54.958 --> 38:56.126
Nice.

38:56.293 --> 38:57.878
Okay, now the Carl cat story.

38:58.045 --> 38:59.212

Whoo!

39:30.994 --> 39:32.579
Yeah!

39:33.705 --> 39:36.750
Ugh, I ate more tonight
than I've eaten in a month.

39:37.584 --> 39:39.920
Hey, uh, you realize

39:40.087 --> 39:41.421
you haven't talked
about having a drink

39:41.588 --> 39:42.714
since you've been here?

39:43.340 --> 39:44.800
I guess I felt comfortable.

39:44.966 --> 39:46.134
Plus, I can't drink
after 7:00 anyway,

39:46.301 --> 39:47.511
because everyone's gonna
smell it on me

39:47.677 --> 39:48.970
at my meeting tomorrow morning.

39:49.137 --> 39:49.930
Aye.

39:50.597 --> 39:52.015
How's my shiv looking?

39:52.641 --> 39:54.184
Mm, sharper.

39:54.351 --> 39:55.769
That thing
can't puncture flesh.

39:55.936 --> 39:57.979
E--see, look at mine.
Mm?

39:58.146 --> 39:59.022
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

39:59.147 --> 40:01.024
Take that, you rape-y pillow.

40:02.401 --> 40:04.444
Uh, can I give my two cents
about prison?

40:05.862 --> 40:06.571
Sure.

40:06.738 --> 40:07.823
Find a hobby.

40:07.989 --> 40:09.783
Makes the time go
so much faster.

40:09.950 --> 40:11.410
Oh, papier-mâché's good.

40:11.576 --> 40:14.079
Easy to do with toilet paper,
glue, and water.

40:14.246 --> 40:16.081
You learn that
from one of your movies?

40:16.248 --> 40:17.457
Bitch, please.

40:17.624 --> 40:18.875
I served time.

40:19.042 --> 40:20.961
48 hours for DUI.

40:21.420 --> 40:23.088
Oh, I didn't know
I was in the company

40:23.255 --> 40:24.423
of such a badass.

40:25.298 --> 40:27.008
Maybe I should go to prison,
too.

40:27.175 --> 40:29.636
Seems like the only way
I'll find a real relationship.

40:29.803 --> 40:30.887
That's not true.

40:31.054 --> 40:33.098
It is.
I'm unlucky in love.

40:33.265 --> 40:34.474
Men, women...

40:34.641 --> 40:37.144
Hey, you're a special woman.

40:37.310 --> 40:39.104
You don't want just anyone.

40:39.521 --> 40:42.649
No, you--you want somebody
who gets you.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.163
I played a lesbian once
in a movie.

40:56.329 --> 40:58.165
- Whoa.
- Wow.

40:58.331 --> 40:59.374
Face it,

40:59.541 --> 41:01.001
you're gorgeous!

41:07.257 --> 41:10.886
If I don't come up
with 25 grand...

41:12.012 --> 41:14.556
I'm gonna be in default
on my partnership agreement

41:14.723 --> 41:15.849
and lose

41:16.016 --> 41:18.977
my $100,000 investment.

41:20.645 --> 41:22.772
I got my car repo-d this week.

41:26.860 --> 41:29.029
And I'll have to foreclose

41:29.196 --> 41:31.531
on my apartment building,

41:31.698 --> 41:35.869
and my credit
will just be... ruined.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.498
My mom and I
are getting kicked out

41:39.664 --> 41:41.333
of our Section 8 housing.

41:44.669 --> 41:45.879
That sucks.

41:47.589 --> 41:48.798
I'm sorry.

41:56.223 --> 41:57.474
What was that?

41:58.016 --> 41:59.351
Looked like a dick.

42:09.236 --> 42:10.111
Huh.

42:15.325 --> 42:17.118
Bye-bye, hot pink anal beads.

42:17.869 --> 42:20.080
We never really used them,
anyway.

42:20.413 --> 42:21.498
I did.

42:23.083 --> 42:25.085
When you were visiting
your mother.

42:25.252 --> 42:26.253
You did?

42:26.419 --> 42:27.921
Oh, yeah.

42:28.088 --> 42:29.548
I was so stressed that night.

42:29.714 --> 42:30.924
I thought I lost one inside me.

42:31.091 --> 42:32.384
I couldn't remember

42:33.051 --> 42:35.011
if I started out
with five or six beads.

42:37.264 --> 42:38.598
Good riddance.

42:42.727 --> 42:45.855
Someone is up there,
throwing stuff.

42:52.028 --> 42:53.947
No.

42:54.114 --> 42:56.449
I--I can't.
I--I--

42:56.616 --> 42:58.702
I have a boyfriend.
Oh,

42:58.868 --> 43:00.120
and I--I lied to him,

43:00.287 --> 43:02.414
and he's really mad at me.

43:02.998 --> 43:05.667
I might've fucked
the whole thing up.

43:09.087 --> 43:11.131
I have to apologize.

43:37.449 --> 43:38.533
Hey.

43:39.951 --> 43:41.953
For your commissary account.

43:47.500 --> 43:48.543
I'll pay you back.

43:48.710 --> 43:50.211
No, you won't.

44:48.269 --> 44:49.562
Are you stalking me?

44:49.938 --> 44:51.564
Do I need to call the police?

44:52.649 --> 44:53.942
I know it was you.

44:56.528 --> 44:58.405
I was having a bad day.

44:58.988 --> 45:01.199
My medications were off.

45:02.158 --> 45:03.243
Wasn't the real me.

45:03.410 --> 45:06.830
I think it was the real you,
and I loved it.

45:06.996 --> 45:08.915
What?

45:09.082 --> 45:11.251
You don't have anything
to be ashamed of.

45:11.418 --> 45:13.253
You are fantastic.

45:15.588 --> 45:17.549
I wish I were normal.

45:18.383 --> 45:19.426
Why?

45:20.969 --> 45:23.680
I-I don't really like

Fiona, wait.
Patty and I are separated.

48:12.056 --> 48:13.558
That didn't look separated
to me.

48:13.725 --> 48:14.809
We're getting a divorce.

48:15.560 --> 48:16.561
Why wouldn't you just

48:16.728 --> 48:17.604
tell me that you're married?

48:17.770 --> 48:19.230
We stayed together
for the kid.

48:19.397 --> 48:20.440

your fucking hand off my car.

48:32.994 --> 48:33.953
Don't do this, Fiona.

48:34.120 --> 48:35.371
- Take your fucking hand--
- No way! Fucking no!

48:35.538 --> 48:37.290

Fuck.

49:11.324 --> 49:12.492
Fiona!

49:21.000 --> 49:22.961
You sure she said
she was gonna drive you?

49:23.127 --> 49:24.337
Yep.

49:24.504 --> 49:26.339
Still going to voice mail.

49:28.675 --> 49:30.343
How about Uncle Kev drives you?

49:32.637 --> 49:34.514
I'll go get my truck.

49:34.847 --> 49:35.848
Thanks, man.

I, uh...

50:16.222 --> 50:17.473
thought Geneva
and some of the others

50:17.640 --> 50:19.100
would be here, but...

50:20.810 --> 50:23.062
You can only count
on family, dude.

50:26.899 --> 50:28.568
I'm gonna miss you.

50:41.289 --> 50:42.582
Don't get too raped in there,
all right?

50:42.749 --> 50:44.042
- Kevin!
- I'm sorry.

50:44.208 --> 50:45.334
I don't know what to say
in these situations.

50:45.501 --> 50:47.754
How about "Bye"
and "I love you"?

50:49.172 --> 50:50.631
B-bye, man.

50:51.382 --> 50:52.550
I love you.

50:53.009 --> 50:54.052

51:06.189 --> 51:07.940

51:08.107 --> 51:10.318
