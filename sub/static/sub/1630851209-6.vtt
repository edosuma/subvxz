00:01.871 --> 00:03.133
<i>You're probably
wondering what we're doing.</i>

00:03.177 --> 00:05.092
<i>Short answer,
saving the earth.</i>

00:05.135 --> 00:06.745
Again.

00:06.789 --> 00:08.008
I'm not leaving without you.

00:08.051 --> 00:10.271
I need something soft
to land on.

00:22.326 --> 00:25.808
<i>Previously on
this filmed documentary program,</i>

00:25.851 --> 00:28.941
<i>or whatever the fuck
this is supposed to be.</i>

00:28.985 --> 00:32.336
Behind this door is
the living quarters of The Sire.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.859
The actual Sire?

00:33.903 --> 00:36.471
Do not ever open this door.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.908
- Peekaboo.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.518
As I was saying,

00:40.562 --> 00:42.868
- do not ever...
- Open the door.

00:42.912 --> 00:44.435
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Got it.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.050
As leader of...

00:50.093 --> 00:52.052
Coleader.

00:52.095 --> 00:54.054
...of the Vampiric Council,
it is one of my...

00:54.097 --> 00:55.098
Our.

00:56.404 --> 00:59.146
...our duties
to be looking after The Sire.

00:59.189 --> 01:02.323
<i>The Sire is the original vampire</i>

01:02.366 --> 01:04.934
from which all other vampires
are descended.

01:04.977 --> 01:06.675
<i>Over the centuries,</i>

01:06.718 --> 01:11.158
<i>it has devolved into a horrific
and fearsome creature.</i>

01:11.201 --> 01:15.205
<i>He is one very angry,
very crispy piece of crust.</i>

01:15.249 --> 01:18.730
But its continued health
is of extreme importance

01:18.774 --> 01:21.516
for the fate
of all vampire-kind.

01:21.559 --> 01:24.910
So, uh, why are we
talking to you about The Sire?

01:24.954 --> 01:27.609
- Um...

01:30.264 --> 01:33.571
It is a fucking mess down here.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.747
No one is respecting
my organizational system.

01:35.791 --> 01:37.749
What are you
pissing on about?

01:37.793 --> 01:39.316
Look at this.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.449
What is the point
of having a glowing orb section

01:41.492 --> 01:44.843
if you're gonna put the glowing
orb in the monkey paw section?

01:44.887 --> 01:46.845
I've just got to find this
stupid magic flute for Laszlo.

01:46.889 --> 01:48.847
He wants to use it
to seduce some mail woman,

01:48.891 --> 01:50.806
and to be honest,
I'm here for it.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.112
Oh, shit.

01:52.155 --> 01:53.809
- What is it?
- Shit, shit, shit,

01:53.852 --> 01:55.289
The Sire!
- shit!

01:55.332 --> 01:56.638
- He is... Oh...

01:56.681 --> 01:58.379
- Open-open the door, Nandor.
- Yes.

01:58.422 --> 02:00.120
Got it.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.471
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- Oh, damn.

02:03.514 --> 02:04.733
- Oh.

02:04.776 --> 02:06.300
Oh, The Sire.

02:06.343 --> 02:07.605
Sire.

02:07.649 --> 02:08.998
Oh, no.

02:09.041 --> 02:10.608
It seems that The Sire
was so hungry

02:10.652 --> 02:13.002
that it took the
sharpened bones of its victims

02:13.045 --> 02:14.612
and tunneled a hole in the wall.

02:14.656 --> 02:16.136
I can't believe it.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.094
Little rascal.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.791
I can't believe you

02:19.835 --> 02:21.880
managed to mess this up
so badly, Nandor.

02:21.924 --> 02:23.491
It was your job
to feed The Sire.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.188
- Me?
- Yes, you.

02:25.232 --> 02:26.276
What?

02:26.320 --> 02:27.451
<i>So, yeah,</i>

02:27.495 --> 02:29.410
turns out I never actually

02:29.453 --> 02:31.151
told Nandor to feed The Sire.

02:32.761 --> 02:34.066
How is this my fault?

02:34.110 --> 02:36.068
Because I said to you that

02:36.112 --> 02:38.070
you're the one to be responsible
for feeding The Sire.

02:40.203 --> 02:43.163
What have I done?

02:43.206 --> 02:44.381
<i>I was meaning to.</i>

02:44.425 --> 02:45.991
I even wrote it
on a sticky note.

02:46.035 --> 02:48.211
"Ask Nandor Feed Sire."

02:48.255 --> 02:51.214
But I never actually got around
to giving him the message.

02:52.868 --> 02:56.393
So, you know, I think
it's very difficult to say

02:56.437 --> 02:58.090
who's at fault, really.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.750
♪ <i>Don't sing if you want

03:05.794 --> 03:08.231

03:35.737 --> 03:37.782
Why are you just
fucking sitting there?!

03:37.826 --> 03:39.828
- We're all gonna fucking die!
All die.

03:39.871 --> 03:41.482
Oh, my love.
Please don't tell me

03:41.525 --> 03:43.614
you believe in this bullshit?
- Of course I do.

03:43.658 --> 03:46.313
If the vampire that
turns you dies, then you die.

03:46.356 --> 03:49.664
So, if the original vampire
dies, you all die?

03:49.707 --> 03:51.927
All die.
No,
it's a fucking urban myth.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.059
Like ghosts or large penises.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.800
You don't want to help?
Fine.

03:55.844 --> 03:57.193
I will fix this.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.761
Since this is all
my big dumb stupid fault.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.632
No, Master.
Yes.

04:01.676 --> 04:04.156
- Control that hellhound!
Nandor, wait!

04:04.200 --> 04:06.463
- Nandor...
- People will believe anything
these days.

04:06.507 --> 04:08.030
Absolutely anything.

04:08.073 --> 04:10.250
I tell you,
if what they're saying is true,

04:10.293 --> 04:13.078
both my wife and I
would be dead by now.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.733
- Yeah.
- The Baron obviously
turned my wife into a vampire

04:15.777 --> 04:17.953
and she turned me
into a vampire.

04:17.996 --> 04:20.738
You two should be dead because
The Baron is definitely dead.

04:20.782 --> 04:22.305
- Absolutely.

04:22.349 --> 04:23.959
The Baron is definitely dead.

04:24.002 --> 04:26.962
Yeah, burnt to a crisp
and buried in the backyard.

04:27.005 --> 04:28.920
In the back garden, as we speak.

04:29.921 --> 04:31.619
- Fuck. Get a shovel.
- Yeah.

04:31.662 --> 04:33.011
Gizmo!

04:33.055 --> 04:34.491
I am not accustomed

04:34.535 --> 04:37.364
to taking responsibility
for my missteps.

04:37.407 --> 04:40.149
<i>When I was
a military general,</i>

04:40.192 --> 04:42.369
<i>if there was a problem
in one of my various wars,</i>

04:42.412 --> 04:45.197
<i>I would simply
blame another nation</i>

04:45.241 --> 04:47.025
and then we would
go to war with them.

04:47.069 --> 04:49.550
And so on, etcetera.
We've all been there.

04:49.593 --> 04:52.509
But, as leader
of the Vampiric Council...

04:52.553 --> 04:54.859
Coleader!

04:54.903 --> 04:58.733
I must swallow my pride
and do what is right.

04:58.776 --> 05:02.040
It says here that the correct
name for The Sire

05:02.084 --> 05:05.957
is, in fact, uh,
"G-G-Gajillarum"?

05:06.001 --> 05:09.483
I think you swallow the "G,"
so it's like "Yarilariur."

05:09.526 --> 05:10.875
It doesn't seem right.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.660
- Are you sure?
No.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.575
I need to figure this out before
my press conference begins.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.577
No, what? We don't need
to do a press conference,

05:16.620 --> 05:18.056
we just need
to capture the bloody thing.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.755
No! I need to let
the vampire community know

05:20.798 --> 05:22.626
what is happening
and put their mind at ease.

05:22.670 --> 05:25.368
'Cause it is I who have failed
to perform a very simple job.

05:25.412 --> 05:26.804
I don't think we need to-- Oh.

05:26.848 --> 05:29.590
Over the power of the ether,

05:29.633 --> 05:31.809
I hereby summon

05:31.853 --> 05:34.725
the vampire society's
most respected journalists,

05:34.769 --> 05:36.945
news anchors,
bloggers, vloggers

05:36.988 --> 05:41.515
and high school yearbook
editors.

05:41.558 --> 05:44.126
- Oh, it worked.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.519
Thank you all for coming.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.390
Is this thing on?

05:47.434 --> 05:49.261
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Uh...

05:49.305 --> 05:51.612
But now is not the time
for jokes.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.396
This evening,

05:53.440 --> 05:56.356
at approximately 9:53
in the p.m. Staten Island time,

05:56.399 --> 05:59.750
the creature known as The Sire,

05:59.794 --> 06:03.363
- aka Girlyjim...
- Nailed it.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.626
...escaped
Vampiric Council watch

06:05.669 --> 06:07.845
and is currently at large

06:07.889 --> 06:10.761
- in the tristate area,
exact location unknown.

06:10.805 --> 06:13.634
I, Nandor The Relentless,

06:13.677 --> 06:17.638
co-supreme leader
of the Vampiric Council,

06:17.681 --> 06:21.381
- do hereby accept full
responsibility for this misstep.

06:21.424 --> 06:22.730
- Time for questions.
I have a question!
- Coleader Nandor.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.253
- Yes?
- Coleader Nandor, hi.

06:24.296 --> 06:25.689
Uh, Lars Murderbone, <i>
Orlando Sentinel.</i>

06:25.733 --> 06:27.387
Is there currently
any kind of plan in place

06:27.430 --> 06:28.997
to capture The Sire?

06:29.040 --> 06:31.478
We have a plan and it is
going absolutely perfectly.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.175
- So, you can go.
- Yes.

06:33.218 --> 06:35.656
And you know, there's a lot
of speculation saying,

06:35.699 --> 06:38.485
"Oh, this is gonna be the end
of vampires as we know it."

06:38.528 --> 06:40.704
- What?!
- No one asked.

06:40.748 --> 06:43.620
Even if that did happen,
we've had a wonderful run,

06:43.664 --> 06:45.405
haven't we?
We've had a great time.

06:45.448 --> 06:47.581
- You've doomed us all!
- Oh, no!

06:47.624 --> 06:50.192
Okay, bye.

06:51.759 --> 06:55.980
You have just made things
significantly worse.

06:57.852 --> 07:00.158
- No. No.

07:01.464 --> 07:05.033
- Dig there.
That's literally
what I'm doing right now.

07:05.076 --> 07:06.643
Well, dig deeper.

07:06.687 --> 07:08.428
I can't remember
where we buried the bastard.

07:08.471 --> 07:09.646
Might this be him?

07:09.690 --> 07:10.821
Uh, that might not.

07:10.865 --> 07:13.607
That is the census taker, 1990.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.435
- What about this chap?
Nope.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.698
Oh, for fuck's sake.

07:17.741 --> 07:20.657
Now that rock
is beginning to ring a bell.

07:20.701 --> 07:21.963
That rock there.

07:22.006 --> 07:23.355
That does ring a bell,
that rock.

07:23.399 --> 07:26.097
Baron? Are you there?

07:26.141 --> 07:27.838
Yes.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.449
Oh, my God.
Shit.

07:29.492 --> 07:30.754
Did you hear that?
Baron?

07:30.798 --> 07:32.277
Yes?
It's over there.

07:32.321 --> 07:34.366
- Baron?
- Baron?
I am here.

07:34.410 --> 07:35.542
Here, here.
Start digging, man.
Here. Come on.

07:35.585 --> 07:37.282
- Shit.

07:37.326 --> 07:40.285
Big pull now.
Almost there.

07:42.505 --> 07:46.335
- Well, fancy seeing you here,
Baron.

07:46.378 --> 07:49.469
- We thought you were dead.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.427
Well, no, I am not.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.385
You see,
when you buried me,

07:53.429 --> 07:57.520
I was pretty much dead,
but not completely dead.

07:59.174 --> 08:01.524
Give The Baron his last sip.

08:01.568 --> 08:02.743
Of course.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.179
Shall we just get him in?

08:04.222 --> 08:05.963
Yeah.
Goodbye, Baron.

08:06.007 --> 08:08.400
I was able to slowly
regain my strength,

08:08.444 --> 08:11.229
subsisting on the blood-soaked dirt

08:11.273 --> 08:15.669
of the many, many humans
you have buried out here.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.192
That was a bit of luck.

08:17.235 --> 08:19.586
Now, I did try to dig my way
to the surface

08:19.629 --> 08:21.588
using just my mouth

08:21.631 --> 08:25.679
and this one arm
that is fused to my chest.

08:25.722 --> 08:29.247
I guess I was digging sideways
instead of up.

08:31.206 --> 08:35.558
Yeah, that'll happen
when your arm is, uh, yeah.

08:35.602 --> 08:38.779
Soon, I recovered enough
to cry out

08:38.822 --> 08:41.042
and beg you to dig me up.

08:41.085 --> 08:43.784
Uh, "Help! Help!" I cried.

08:43.827 --> 08:45.873
- Oh, okay. That was you, then.
Right.

08:45.916 --> 08:47.570
Yeah, I heard the screams,

08:47.614 --> 08:49.833
but I just thought it was
someone in the neighborhood

08:49.877 --> 08:52.575
in grave danger.
I was like, "Not my problem."

08:52.619 --> 08:54.359
That is all in the past,

08:54.403 --> 08:59.321
because I am now back,
and I have never felt better.

08:59.364 --> 09:02.019
If I,
if I could just... get...
Well, you look good.

09:02.063 --> 09:05.501
Oh, oh. Almost.
Ah. Yes, okay.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.329
There we go.
Okay.

09:07.372 --> 09:09.853
- Who wants to get smacked first?
Oh.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.855
Yeah, it was
a little nerve-racking

09:11.899 --> 09:14.554
seeing The Baron again,
considering our-our history.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.864
But he doesn't seem
to remember anything.

09:20.908 --> 09:23.911
<i>He was on a lot of
drug blood that night, so...</i>

09:23.954 --> 09:26.957
What he don't
know won't hurt him, or me.

09:27.001 --> 09:28.829
So nice to be back in the arms

09:28.872 --> 09:33.529
- of a big, strong boy. Mwah.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.183
<i>But this means that
that Sire theory--</i>

09:35.226 --> 09:36.488
<i>"If he dies they all die"--</i>

09:36.532 --> 09:38.229
that might be real.

09:38.273 --> 09:39.927
Sorry, Baron. Urgent matter.

09:39.970 --> 09:42.059
We must attend to it. Bye!

09:42.103 --> 09:44.105
Feed him. A simple task.

09:44.148 --> 09:45.497
I accept full responsibility.

09:45.541 --> 09:47.456
I don't see how that helps us.

09:47.499 --> 09:50.328
Oh, good evening,
my sweet companions.

09:50.372 --> 09:52.635
The Baron. You're alive... ish.

09:52.679 --> 09:55.638
- Well, catch me up.
Have you taken over America?
Uh...

09:55.682 --> 09:58.815
Well, we've, um, taken over
the local Vampiric Council.

09:58.859 --> 09:59.816
- Huzzah!

09:59.860 --> 10:01.644
Yes, huzzah!

10:01.688 --> 10:03.646
But it's not going so great.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.300
Understatement of the year.

10:05.343 --> 10:06.823
What she said.

10:06.867 --> 10:08.695
Yes, you've picked
a bit of a shitty time

10:08.738 --> 10:10.827
- to come back from the dead.
I see.

10:10.871 --> 10:13.047
Uh, speaking of which,
could one of you be a dear

10:13.090 --> 10:14.962
and push my eye back in?

10:15.005 --> 10:17.399
- Guillermo?
- Guillermo.

10:17.442 --> 10:20.576
- Also, I think one of my ears
fell off in the foyer,

10:20.620 --> 10:22.709
- if we could...
- Which one?
- Does it matter?

10:22.752 --> 10:25.668
Which ear was it again?
The right one.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.409
We need to find The Sire!

10:27.452 --> 10:28.802
I believe his theory.
I always have.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.630
Oh. Shit. They're right,
what are we doing?

10:30.673 --> 10:32.675
- Nobody panic. Everybody...
I'm not panicking!

10:32.719 --> 10:33.894
We're all gonna die!

10:33.937 --> 10:35.417
My sword.

10:35.460 --> 10:36.287
Come on,
there's no time to waste!

10:36.331 --> 10:37.332
Help!

10:42.729 --> 10:45.557
Sorry, there's not chalkboard in
here, so I had to use my mouth.

10:45.601 --> 10:48.256
So, you want to catch a vampire,
huh?

10:48.299 --> 10:50.693
Well, it ain't gonna be easy.

10:50.737 --> 10:53.957
It's not like catching rats
or elderly joggers.

10:54.001 --> 10:56.917
Joggers.
Yeah, that's <i>Jaws,</i> 1975.

10:56.960 --> 11:00.007
The shark kept malfunctioning,
and so Spielberg...

11:00.050 --> 11:01.573
Shut up!

11:01.617 --> 11:03.227
You promoted me
to be a bodyguard.

11:03.271 --> 11:06.970
I believe that
I should be in charge

11:07.014 --> 11:08.580
of catching The Sire.

11:10.844 --> 11:13.585
- All right.
- Yeah. Fuck it.
- What?

11:13.629 --> 11:15.283
- Okay, fine.
Yeah, sure, whatever.
Don't give a shit.

11:15.326 --> 11:17.285
Now wait just a moment.

11:17.328 --> 11:20.680
You are going to place
the fate of all vampire-kind

11:20.723 --> 11:23.857
into the hands of your familiar?

11:23.900 --> 11:26.903
Well, he's actually
quite a skilled vampire hunter.

11:26.947 --> 11:31.647
- I mean, he killed you.

11:31.691 --> 11:36.130
-...gene, he killed Eugene.
A very powerful vampire.
- Oh.

11:36.173 --> 11:38.654
Maybe later we'll talk
about Eugene some more,

11:38.698 --> 11:39.655
but, Guide Lady,
I need you to check in

11:39.699 --> 11:41.048
with your intel sources.

11:41.091 --> 11:42.571
How do you know
I have intel sources?

11:42.614 --> 11:44.094
Oh, you don't?

11:44.138 --> 11:47.097
No, I-I do have
intel sources. The Watchers.

11:47.141 --> 11:48.751
Nadja, why don't you
go with her, tag along?

11:48.795 --> 11:50.274
- Maybe you'll learn
a thing or two.

11:50.318 --> 11:51.928
And, Laszlo, why don't you
change your shoes,

11:51.972 --> 11:53.669
'cause those don't look comfy
at all, and you're gonna

11:53.713 --> 11:55.236
- do some groundwork, okay?
- Why don't you get fucked?

11:55.279 --> 11:57.629
Okay. And you go get me
a glass of water, no ice.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.066
Yeah, I wouldn't have a clue

11:59.109 --> 12:00.763
where you would find
something like that.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.809
Don't get cocky.
Eat shit, Guillermo.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.462
Have you got some sack,
my boy.

12:04.506 --> 12:06.856
So then, if you don't need me,
I'll be on my way.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.249
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, Guillermo.

12:08.292 --> 12:09.859
- Not so fast.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.209
- Not so fast, old chap.
Okay, then.

12:12.253 --> 12:14.646
What are you waiting for?
You have your orders. Go.

12:14.690 --> 12:15.735
- Let's do it.
- Come on.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.001
<i>When I'm in desperate need
of information,</i>

12:21.044 --> 12:22.567
<i>I have two go-to sources.</i>

12:22.611 --> 12:23.786
The Watchers.

12:28.922 --> 12:30.358
Are they meeting us here, or...?

12:30.401 --> 12:31.707
Oh, they're here already.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.883
They've always been here.

12:33.927 --> 12:36.190
I mean, at least
since this building was built.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.931
Hello, ladies.

12:37.974 --> 12:40.107
- Oh, yeah.

12:41.978 --> 12:44.459
- Honey, it's been way too long.
- Oh.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.809
And looks like
you finally made a friend.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.333
Hello.
We have
a desperate emergency.

12:49.377 --> 12:51.335
We were wondering
if anyone has spotted

12:51.379 --> 12:53.598
an ancient vampire on the loose?

12:53.642 --> 12:56.993
- About four-foot-nine.
Horrible face.
Oh, my.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.386
Completely naked.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.910
Genitalia like nothing
you've ever seen.

13:00.954 --> 13:03.739
You'd be surprised
at what I have seen,

13:03.783 --> 13:05.697
but no,
not ringing any bells.

13:05.741 --> 13:07.003
Speaking of ringing bells,
listen to this.

13:07.047 --> 13:08.483
You know how
Count Blake the Torturous

13:08.526 --> 13:09.701
is selling
his haunted clock tower?

13:09.745 --> 13:11.181
- Yes.
- Well, it turns out

13:11.225 --> 13:13.618
they had to lower
the asking price, twice.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.185
- Twice!
- In this market?

13:15.229 --> 13:17.187
I know. Just because
it has half a staircase

13:17.231 --> 13:18.841
doesn't make it a duplex.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.801
Also, yeah, they're, like,
super gossipy bitches.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.454
Oh! Sorry! This is very urgent!

13:23.498 --> 13:25.543
- Back to it, please.
We need your help.
- No fun.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.807
All right, I'll check in with
some of the other gargoyles.

13:27.850 --> 13:28.982
Thank you.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.943
Oh, you know, I've heard
this sound at night sometimes,

13:33.987 --> 13:36.685
but I always just thought
it was a passing truck.

13:36.728 --> 13:37.860
Huh!

13:37.904 --> 13:39.819
- Oh.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.472
All right, all right,
I've got something for you.

13:41.516 --> 13:44.824
So, hearing from one
of my 'goyles out in Queens...

13:44.867 --> 13:46.129
"'Goyles." We get it.

13:46.173 --> 13:48.697
Low-hanging fruit
has never made me laugh.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.873
Your sense of humor
is so fucking interesting.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.875
Oh, shut up, you old cooze.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.834
- The Sire! The Sire!
- You got it.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.966
A creature
that matches that description

13:57.010 --> 13:58.663
was spotted in Ozone Park.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.578
- Ozone Park. Got it.
- Come on!

14:00.622 --> 14:02.972
- Thank you.
- Uh, wait! Don't you have
any hot goss for us?

14:03.016 --> 14:04.582
Quid pro quo, Clarice.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.106
Sorry. Fresh out.

14:06.149 --> 14:07.803
- Got to run!
- Oh! Nice!

14:07.847 --> 14:09.544
I guess see you next time
you need something from us.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.589
- What a pair of messy bitches.
- Yeah.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.374
I'm obsessed.

14:13.417 --> 14:14.854
Sire!
- Where's that magic flute

14:14.897 --> 14:16.072
- when you need it?
Shush, Laszlo.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.160
All right, everyone,

14:17.204 --> 14:18.596
stay alert and stay vigilant.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.250
Careful. He might be hiding
up a tree.

14:20.294 --> 14:21.904
Oh...

14:21.948 --> 14:23.253
Stop!

14:23.297 --> 14:25.168
- What is that?
- Look at these footsteps.

14:25.212 --> 14:26.909
- Something's not right.
- Careful!

14:29.129 --> 14:30.521
Just like I suspected.

14:30.565 --> 14:32.088
Vampire piss.

14:32.132 --> 14:33.916
How do you know
what vampire piss tastes like?

14:33.960 --> 14:36.397
- Just trust me, okay?
- Hmm.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.833
Judging by these tracks,

14:37.877 --> 14:39.791
he's headed... south.

14:39.835 --> 14:42.229
Oh.
- Okay, you heard Piss Man.
Let's move.

14:42.272 --> 14:44.753
- She calls for us to move!
- I just fucking said it.

14:44.796 --> 14:46.407
She just fucking said it!

14:46.450 --> 14:49.323
I made a posting
on the website Nextdoor

14:49.366 --> 14:51.542
asking if anyone saw
anything suspicious,

14:51.586 --> 14:53.457
but it-it just kind of
turned into

14:53.501 --> 14:55.068
- an orgy of racism.

14:55.111 --> 14:57.026
- Okay! Come on! This way!
Oh, we must hurry.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.855
- Go, Hellhound. Go, baby.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.683
Careful, careful.

15:01.726 --> 15:04.207
Looks like The Sire stopped
for a snack.

15:04.251 --> 15:06.427
Oh, little snack.
- Probably the security guard.

15:06.470 --> 15:09.821
Yum.
- It's like the meat has been
sucked out from the inside,

15:09.865 --> 15:12.999
like a hairy crab leg.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.914
- He probably took the carcass
inside.
- The what?

15:14.957 --> 15:16.698
- The "cuh-cass." The "cuh-cass."
- Yes,

15:16.741 --> 15:18.743
-"cuh-cass."
- Which means one thing.

15:18.787 --> 15:19.962
He's trapped.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.659
- This is our chance.
- Great.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.400
- Well, you go ahead
and we'll wait here.
- No!

15:23.444 --> 15:26.142
- All your lives depend on this!
- All vampires' lives!

15:26.186 --> 15:27.970
Not mine. Not energy vampires.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.580
This is hopeless.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.495
The sun is going to come up
and, when it does,

15:31.539 --> 15:33.628
it's going to kill that thing
and then we're all going to die

15:33.671 --> 15:35.586
and it's all because of me!

15:35.630 --> 15:37.327
Fucking...

15:37.371 --> 15:39.677
Stop feeling sorry
for yourself, okay?

15:39.721 --> 15:41.941
And help me help you fix this!

15:43.812 --> 15:46.119
Let's go kill that Sire.

15:46.162 --> 15:48.077
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Yes. Well, no, no!

15:48.121 --> 15:49.992
Let's not kill.
We're not gonna kill it.

15:50.036 --> 15:52.212
- Whoa there, beast! Heel!

15:52.255 --> 15:54.649
No, we're not
gonna kill it, remem...
Cursed brute!

15:54.692 --> 15:56.477
A little help, please?

15:56.520 --> 15:59.480
Wow, that freak really tore
this place up.

15:59.523 --> 16:01.569
Where is
the ravenous little monster?

16:01.612 --> 16:03.179
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

16:03.223 --> 16:05.051
Nadja, Laszlo,
you'll find The Sire

16:05.094 --> 16:06.791
and corner him
to the back of the store

16:06.835 --> 16:09.185
while Colin Robinson, Nandor
and myself will be there

16:09.229 --> 16:11.100
waiting for him
so he doesn't escape.

16:11.144 --> 16:13.320
And, uh,

16:13.363 --> 16:15.409
Guide Lady and The Baron...

16:15.452 --> 16:17.498
Mm-hmm.
-...whatever you do,
just do it quietly.

16:17.541 --> 16:18.629
- GUIDE

16:20.501 --> 16:22.372
Come on, my darling. Let's head
for the women's intimates.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.200
- This way.
- Can you stop flashing
that thing in my eyes?

16:24.244 --> 16:25.201
Sorry.

16:25.245 --> 16:26.898
Yoo-hoo!

16:26.942 --> 16:28.509
Grijillium.

16:28.552 --> 16:30.511
Now, if I had my magic flute,

16:30.554 --> 16:32.339
this would all be over
in two minutes.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.384
Would you shut the fuck up
about your pissing magic flute?

16:34.428 --> 16:35.864
My magic flute works.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.822
- Grianjistun!

16:39.563 --> 16:41.217
Bloody shit! There he is!

16:41.261 --> 16:46.483
Oh!
- Whoa!

16:52.533 --> 16:54.187
- Shit.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.058
Dring Grinjly.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.367
- Gruj-Grujum!

17:00.410 --> 17:01.759
Oh.

17:01.803 --> 17:03.761
Jin-Jingreelij.

17:03.805 --> 17:08.201
We've come to take you home to
your lovely, cozy prison cell!

17:08.244 --> 17:09.593
What is he doing?

17:09.637 --> 17:11.030
We need something
to get his attention.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.248
Yeah, well, we might be in luck.

17:12.292 --> 17:13.858
We don't have a magic flute.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.471
We got one of these.
Don't mind if I do.

17:17.514 --> 17:19.473
- Careful.

17:22.302 --> 17:24.173
- Oh, yes. That's right.

17:24.217 --> 17:26.958
Come on, big green baby.
Yes, come to Mama.

17:27.002 --> 17:29.352
- Oh, Laszlo, look out!

17:29.396 --> 17:30.745
- My darling!

17:30.788 --> 17:32.399
Fuck me.

17:32.442 --> 17:33.704
Leave him alone!

17:33.748 --> 17:34.923
- Stop it!

17:34.966 --> 17:36.577
Leave my husband alone!

17:46.848 --> 17:48.197
Laszlo!

17:48.241 --> 17:50.460
My darling! Oh!

17:50.504 --> 17:53.376
Are you dead?! My love.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.465
- I think
I swallowed the harmonica.

17:57.032 --> 17:58.773
- Where is that thing?

17:59.774 --> 18:01.819
If I had more time, I would
build something more advanced,

18:01.863 --> 18:03.430
obviously, but...

18:03.473 --> 18:05.432
I think this will get
the job done.

18:05.475 --> 18:07.390
They didn't have any armor,
so I had to make do.

18:07.434 --> 18:10.132
Yeah. See?
Yeah, that'll do it.
- Yes.

18:10.176 --> 18:14.049
Yeah.
- All we need now is bait.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.270
No. No.

18:17.313 --> 18:18.619
Yes.
- No.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.229
Why do I have to be tied
to this rope?

18:20.273 --> 18:21.622
So that we can yank you back

18:21.665 --> 18:23.493
moments before you are
viciously mauled.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.497
- Shit. What the fuck is this?

18:27.541 --> 18:30.457
Greetings and salutations!

18:30.500 --> 18:32.154
Laszlo, enough.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.330
You did not swallow
a bloody harmonica.

18:34.374 --> 18:36.419
- Yes... I... did.

18:36.463 --> 18:40.380
Human bait. Obviously! We should
have done this from the start!

18:40.423 --> 18:42.164
Nice little car, Baron!

18:42.208 --> 18:45.341
Oh, I am controlling it
with my mind.

18:45.385 --> 18:46.908
Looking good.

18:46.951 --> 18:48.388
That's great.
Where-where is The Sire, though?

18:48.431 --> 18:50.694
He lunged at us.
And he moves like lightning.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.348
So be prepared to yank that rope

18:52.392 --> 18:54.350
and the human bait
very, very quickly.

18:54.394 --> 18:56.439
Don't care about it. Just yank.

18:56.483 --> 18:58.963
<i>-Negabme.
Shit.</i>

19:01.401 --> 19:02.706
Quick! Get out of here!
He can see us!

19:06.145 --> 19:08.538
Make yourself look appetizing,
Guillermo.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.453
Shake your moneymaker.

19:11.672 --> 19:13.587
Enough of this.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.112
Why did you yank me early?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.635
That's what she said.

19:18.679 --> 19:21.247
I just found out
about that series of jokes.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.379
Because you should not be
in this situation.

19:23.423 --> 19:25.599
This is all my doing.

19:25.642 --> 19:28.906
I should be the one that goes
toe to toe with the beast.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.996
Nandor, wait.

19:32.040 --> 19:36.000
Uh, I have something
I need to tell you.

19:36.044 --> 19:37.393
Okay.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.440
I don't think
you should wear that helmet,

19:40.483 --> 19:42.616
because it's going to make
absolutely no difference

19:42.659 --> 19:45.793
when The Sire is crushing you
and mincing you to smithereens.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.795
- Uh, I...
- You look very stupid.

19:47.838 --> 19:50.232
- Okay.
- Take it off.

19:50.276 --> 19:53.453
And I appreciate
you telling me that.

19:53.496 --> 19:54.715
You are a good friend.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.369
Thanks for nothing.

19:56.412 --> 19:58.371
- But I was... trying to save...
- Wish me luck.

19:58.414 --> 19:59.459
Luck.
- Good luck.

20:02.462 --> 20:05.552
Hello, Mr. Sire!
I'm coming to visit with you!

20:05.595 --> 20:07.945
Hey! Hey!

20:07.989 --> 20:10.644
- Hey! Quit!
Can you not do that, please?! <i>
- Neberme ate.</i>

20:10.687 --> 20:13.081
- That's not very nice! Hey!

20:13.124 --> 20:14.430
<i>-Neberme ate.
- Please don't do that.</i>

20:14.474 --> 20:16.432
What is Nandor doing?

20:16.476 --> 20:18.260
The beast just wants to be free.

20:18.304 --> 20:20.784
<i>-Neberme ate.</i>
- Ha-ha! Can't catch me! Ow!

20:20.828 --> 20:23.483
- How do you know that?
- Well, that is
what it keeps saying.

20:23.526 --> 20:27.269
"Neberme ate." Which means
"do not take me back"

20:27.313 --> 20:29.576
in the ancient vampire tongue.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.099
I thought we all knew this.

20:31.142 --> 20:32.274
You speak its language?

20:32.318 --> 20:33.797
But of course.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.799
- Master, wait! I'm coming!
- Wh...

20:35.843 --> 20:38.411
- Whoa!
It's fine.
It's going great.

20:38.454 --> 20:40.239
I think he's getting tired.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.980
- Speak to it. Speak to it.
- Why should I have to speak...

20:43.024 --> 20:44.373
<i>Ko ne dabas, mek?</i>

20:49.030 --> 20:50.118
<i>Ne, ne, ne.</i>

21:01.999 --> 21:04.306
- Oh, oh!

21:04.350 --> 21:06.830
What's so G-damn funny?

21:06.874 --> 21:08.876
Oh. Ladies and gentlemen,

21:08.919 --> 21:10.617
everything is okay now.

21:10.660 --> 21:13.141
Uh, you see,
Goeëjlrm here thought

21:13.184 --> 21:14.751
that you guys wanted
to kill him.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.187
- We did.
What?
- No, it-- No.

21:16.231 --> 21:17.276
No, no, no, no.

21:17.319 --> 21:18.755
Of course not!

21:18.799 --> 21:20.322
- But now that he has been fed

21:20.366 --> 21:23.282
and knows that he is safe,
everything is okay.

21:23.325 --> 21:27.416
- Oh. <i>
- Enter kate ne atgavo.</i>

21:27.460 --> 21:30.114
Ah. And if you try
to put him back in that cell,

21:30.158 --> 21:32.029
he's going to rip each
of your throats out.

21:32.073 --> 21:33.988
- Fair enough.
- Eh.
We could add

21:34.031 --> 21:35.685
some extra hay, you know,

21:35.729 --> 21:37.208
maybe a rope swing.

21:37.252 --> 21:39.341
<i>Enter kate ne atgavo!</i>

21:39.385 --> 21:42.126
- Copy that!
Makes perfect sense.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.345
Come on, old friend.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.347
No one's going to hurt you.

21:45.391 --> 21:48.872
- Can I just say,
on behalf of us--

21:48.916 --> 21:51.135
Oh, fuck it. Doesn't matter.

21:52.136 --> 21:53.703
<i>So we were able to get The Sire</i>

21:53.747 --> 21:56.445
back under
Vampiric Council control.

21:56.489 --> 21:59.448
See? No one's going to hurt you.
We are all, uh, your friends.

21:59.492 --> 22:02.321
<i>Turns out The Sire had
an absolutely excellent sense</i>

22:02.364 --> 22:04.105
of humor. Very dry.

22:04.148 --> 22:06.412
Do you think he'd mind it
if I pulled his tail?

22:06.455 --> 22:07.804
- He likes it!
No, no.
Aah!

22:07.848 --> 22:09.763
Nandor, leave it,
you fucking idiot.

22:09.806 --> 22:11.112
<i>And we have sorted out</i>

22:11.155 --> 22:13.375
a much more suitable
living situation.

22:13.419 --> 22:15.072
For all involved.

22:16.509 --> 22:18.162
<i>Well, frankly, it has turned out</i>

22:18.206 --> 22:20.948
to be a pretty terrific setup
for all three of us.
