WEBVTT

02:06.292 --> 02:09.462
Did you really think
you could deceive someone like me?

02:13.216 --> 02:15.885
You are an unwelcome guest here.

02:16.386 --> 02:21.349
Do you know why people with superpowers
don't come near my island?

02:24.018 --> 02:27.272
I will make it perfectly clear to you now.

02:30.233 --> 02:33.069
Don't even think about
trying to lie to me,

02:33.153 --> 02:35.405
Dr. Morgenstern.

02:41.119 --> 02:44.122
Miguel here is
very interested in this woman.

02:44.205 --> 02:45.832
Let him have her after the interrogation.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.959
No, I will not, Praetorian.

02:48.501 --> 02:51.379
I prefer to finish the girl off quickly.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.923
Of course, Mr. Matts.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.635
Don't you worry, my dear.

02:58.636 --> 03:02.348
A body this beautiful
is no different when dead.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.143
She will still be plenty of fun then.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.276
I think this is the place.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.319
Johnny!

03:14.944 --> 03:16.029
It went well!

03:16.529 --> 03:18.489
I was pretty anxious for a bit there.

03:19.574 --> 03:20.408
That's cold!

03:21.075 --> 03:22.535
What is this? Snow?

03:24.454 --> 03:25.955
What the heck is going on?

03:29.459 --> 03:30.668
That was you?

03:30.752 --> 03:32.211
Aw man, I'm sorry!

03:32.295 --> 03:36.341
I was trying to make a storm,
but all I could think of was a blizzard.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.509
It happens a lot.

03:39.093 --> 03:40.386
Perfect timing.

03:40.470 --> 03:43.640
Why don't you freeze
the hinges on that door for us?

03:46.476 --> 03:47.602
Leave this to me.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.066
Don't catch a cold, anyone!

04:02.200 --> 04:03.451
How much longer?

04:04.786 --> 04:06.496
Great! That's plenty!

04:09.290 --> 04:11.834
I guess it's my turn next.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.010
Watch out back there.

04:33.147 --> 04:35.233
Oh, dear! That's quite deep!

04:35.316 --> 04:38.027
The vault we're after
is on the bottom floor.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.113
Close your eyes and jump.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.572
I'm counting on you, McCabe.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.745
TK, this is a bit much for--

04:54.752 --> 04:57.505
Next stop, bottom floor. The final stop.

04:58.339 --> 04:59.299
Everyone all right?

05:01.050 --> 05:03.636
That psychokinetic jump was awesome!

05:03.720 --> 05:06.723
Descending like that was terrifying.

05:06.806 --> 05:10.018
Up ahead is a hellacious flame pit.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.729
I sure don't want to die by fire.

05:12.812 --> 05:13.938
I couldn't agree more.

05:14.022 --> 05:18.776
So to avoid it, busting through that wall
over there is the quickest shortcut.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.612
-Ghost, take a look for us.
-Right.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.908
Eight, nine guards.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.744
What a pain.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.370
Later, guys.

05:39.922 --> 05:41.174
Magnificent work.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.676
We quite literally busted through.

05:46.345 --> 05:49.432
All right, now for the real climax.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.684
The vault we're after is down there.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.645
The final trap is a molecular chainsaw.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.899
If anyone without
The Bastard's DNA footprint

05:57.982 --> 06:00.026
steps one foot beyond this point,

06:00.526 --> 06:02.653
lasers turn them into mincemeat.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.865
Ghost's power won't work either.

06:05.948 --> 06:09.744
It's rigged to scan every frequency.

06:09.827 --> 06:10.787
What's more,

06:10.870 --> 06:14.457
since the bottom floor is on
a totally independent system,

06:14.540 --> 06:16.334
hacking it is impossible.

06:16.918 --> 06:20.880
The only way to turn it off is by manually
shutting it off with that switch.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.091
You ready for this?

06:24.509 --> 06:25.426
Set!

06:26.219 --> 06:27.386
-Go!
-You bastard!

06:27.470 --> 06:30.807
Just try stopping me, chainsaw!

06:40.233 --> 06:42.443
Fuck!

06:43.694 --> 06:45.071
You deserved that, you wuss!

06:50.118 --> 06:53.371
Even when you've been cut in half,
you still look like a fat slob!

06:53.454 --> 06:55.331
It's going exactly as planned.

06:55.414 --> 06:57.125
You call this a plan?

06:57.208 --> 07:00.419
No matter how often they're sliced up,
they grow right back again.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.839
If these two do this over and over,

07:02.922 --> 07:05.299
they'll eventually get to the other side.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.593
They're the two greatest guys
in the whole world.

07:07.677 --> 07:08.845
We're counting on you!

07:17.437 --> 07:19.522
This is getting pretty gruesome.

07:26.904 --> 07:29.824
Hey, brother,
maybe you should lay off the liquor.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.535
That liver of yours isn't lookin' good.

07:58.394 --> 08:00.188
Sorry it took so long.

08:00.271 --> 08:03.107
Now you dudes can cross safely.

08:03.191 --> 08:07.737
My brother, I won, you motherfucker!

08:11.449 --> 08:13.701
This is one disturbing sight.

08:13.784 --> 08:15.495
You both did great.

08:16.078 --> 08:18.539
Dammit! I could keep this up
a whole lot longer!

08:18.623 --> 08:22.001
Fuck yeah! At least my turds
are bigger than that runt's!

08:22.084 --> 08:23.711
This last part's yours.

08:24.378 --> 08:28.007
The Heat,
melt this door with your ray guns.

08:32.887 --> 08:35.681
Thank you for giving me
a place to show my stuff.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.186
This is a pretty classic way to do it.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.939
That's what makes it so thrilling!

08:50.780 --> 08:51.656
Is that it?

08:53.366 --> 08:56.160
Hard to believe
it's all in this one briefcase.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.662
It's not just any briefcase.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.499
It's a space-case.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.837
Its massive capacity is guaranteed!

09:07.421 --> 09:08.798
Toss in a billion bucks…

09:08.881 --> 09:10.216
No problemo!

09:10.299 --> 09:11.801
Time for a photo.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.844
Say cheese!

09:17.515 --> 09:19.517
It's about to reboot.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.227
Let's hurry up and vamoose.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.315
Ouch! What the hell was that?

09:28.109 --> 09:30.444
Sodium thiopental.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.238
A truth serum.

09:32.321 --> 09:34.532
It will soon take effect.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.536
Start by telling me what your powers are.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.121
My powers?

09:40.621 --> 09:42.415
Who cares about that?

09:42.498 --> 09:44.792
Tell me what your weaknesses are.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.795
-You…
-Never mind her.

09:47.878 --> 09:51.507
The drug has simply
lowered her inhibitions.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.302
Surrounding yourself with works of art is

09:54.385 --> 09:57.847
an obvious ploy to make yourself
look sophisticated, you vulgar douchebag.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.473
Unsurpassable?

09:59.557 --> 10:02.602
You say its beauty is so perfect
that it can't be replicated?

10:02.685 --> 10:06.230
Is that really more thrilling
than the dirty shit you used to do?

10:06.314 --> 10:07.231
What a joke.

10:07.898 --> 10:09.775
You're completely washed up now.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.987
In fact, you weren't worth
a piece of shit in the first place.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.364
Want me to shut her up?

10:15.448 --> 10:17.033
Not yet.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.827
I'll have her tell us everything
while the drug is working.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.747
Why did you come here?

10:22.830 --> 10:24.373
You still don't get it?

10:25.291 --> 10:26.292
Robbery.

10:26.834 --> 10:27.877
What?

10:27.960 --> 10:31.964
Right about now, my pals are
taking every last penny you've got.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.425
Miguel!

10:34.508 --> 10:35.801
Yes, sir!

10:36.385 --> 10:38.304
The sensors aren't picking anything up.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.514
Wait! What's this?

10:41.724 --> 10:42.808
Oh, my god!

10:42.892 --> 10:46.312
The superpower
suppression device is rebooting!

10:46.395 --> 10:49.440
Show me the bottom floor
of the underground area now!

10:51.317 --> 10:53.903
Teleport down there now!

10:54.487 --> 10:55.571
Yes, sir.

10:57.239 --> 11:01.577
When I get my share, I'm taking
my family on a trip through Asia.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.953
Jumping the gun, aren't you?

11:04.163 --> 11:06.749
I only came here 'cause it's where
the job is, but I like this place.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.001
Be careful!
We still haven't left the building!

11:13.005 --> 11:14.298
You fucking idiots.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.300
Oh, shit.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.052
What a pack of morons.

11:19.053 --> 11:22.056
Did you think you'd really get away with

11:23.057 --> 11:25.851
stealing from me
right from under my very feet?

11:25.935 --> 11:29.855
It's not as if you don't know who I am.

11:30.439 --> 11:33.275
Why would you do such an idiotic thing?

11:33.359 --> 11:34.610
You don't know?

11:34.693 --> 11:36.821
Because you're a decrepit old man.

11:37.905 --> 11:40.699
Every night, you gotta piss
again and again, right?

11:40.783 --> 11:43.244
Why wouldn't we steal from you?

11:44.286 --> 11:45.996
Enough of that nonsense!

11:46.080 --> 11:48.457
I am unbeatable!

11:48.541 --> 11:52.837
Yeah, maybe ten
or 20 years ago, that was true,

11:52.920 --> 11:57.049
but now your biggest enemy
is climbing the stairs, right?

11:58.384 --> 12:01.637
Mr. Matts, the underground system
reboot is about to be completed.

12:03.472 --> 12:06.434
In fact, what makes you think
you can defeat us guys in our prime?

12:06.517 --> 12:08.769
Hey! Don't provoke him too much.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.563
We've got to deal with this guy now.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.398
Not to worry.

12:12.481 --> 12:15.359
Why do you think
we brought along that help…

12:15.443 --> 12:17.403
Tough luck.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.447
Just now,

12:19.530 --> 12:22.658
the superpower suppression device
reboot was completed.

12:23.325 --> 12:27.413
It doesn't matter now
what kind of superpowers you people have.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.665
He was just buying time.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.626
Take them down, Praetorian.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.713
He's got the same handicap, you know.

12:35.796 --> 12:36.881
Hey, Glenda!

12:36.964 --> 12:38.591
This one's for you.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.553
Hey, aren't you listening?

12:43.554 --> 12:45.222
Hurry up and kick his--

12:48.058 --> 12:49.852
Shut the fuck up.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.396
Why are you just fucking standing there?

12:54.190 --> 12:57.568
I've been waiting a long time
for you to get knocked on your ass.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.751
I think I'll enjoy the show.

13:19.590 --> 13:24.261
Take your eyes off these young bastards
for a second, and this is what happens.

13:24.762 --> 13:28.599
I need to remind them
of just how terrifying I am.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.477
Miguel.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.688
Shut off the power to
the superpower detectors.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.815
But that will--

13:36.899 --> 13:38.400
Silence!

13:38.901 --> 13:42.780
Ever since I moved here,
I haven't had to use my power.

13:43.781 --> 13:47.034
Don't you worry. It isn't loaded.

13:47.535 --> 13:51.789
I only use it to aim a psychic blast.

13:57.044 --> 13:57.962
Stay away!

14:02.132 --> 14:04.635
You fucking bitch! What did you do?

14:04.718 --> 14:05.886
Mr. Matts!

14:07.972 --> 14:11.392
I get it now.
So you have psychic powers too.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.271
You must be quite talented

14:15.354 --> 14:18.857
if you can push back against my power.

14:18.941 --> 14:22.236
However, once I get inside your mind,

14:22.319 --> 14:24.655
it's impossible to push me out again!

14:27.825 --> 14:33.497
Can you feel your brain
starting to swell behind your eyeballs?

14:34.081 --> 14:36.750
Mr. Matts, what can I do to help?

14:36.834 --> 14:38.627
Just get out, Miguel.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.422
You're distracting me.

14:41.505 --> 14:45.634
This woman requires my full attention.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.347
Okay, you maggots.

14:52.683 --> 14:54.393
What's the matter with you?

14:54.476 --> 14:56.645
I thought you were a pro wrestler.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.648
A lot of that stuff is faked.

15:00.774 --> 15:04.153
Without their power,
all these losers are nothing but

15:04.737 --> 15:05.988
pieces of garbage.

15:10.784 --> 15:12.453
That's enough.

15:12.536 --> 15:13.704
What?

15:14.371 --> 15:16.582
I didn't think you could sink any further.

15:16.665 --> 15:19.752
Not only did you cause trouble
for your old team,

15:19.835 --> 15:22.212
now you're the bodyguard
for a supervillain.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.131
It's so disgusting, it's shocking.

15:25.925 --> 15:26.759
What the fuck?

15:29.929 --> 15:31.472
How dare you talk like that to me?

15:32.056 --> 15:33.599
You want to die?

15:34.266 --> 15:36.560
Who the fuck do you think you are?

15:50.449 --> 15:53.327
I'm a superhero, you asshole!

15:54.078 --> 15:56.330
Holy moly!

15:56.413 --> 15:58.332
What the hell are you doing here?

16:03.379 --> 16:05.255
Wait, Gladiator!

16:05.339 --> 16:06.465
I'm sorry! Just listen!

16:06.548 --> 16:08.801
I never would have thought you--

16:20.729 --> 16:21.605
Shut up!

16:47.423 --> 16:51.802
Scumbag, you've got no right
to call yourself a superhero!

17:10.988 --> 17:12.156
Did you kill him?

17:12.239 --> 17:13.866
What have you done?

17:13.949 --> 17:15.743
We never kill!

17:15.826 --> 17:17.453
That's our rule!

17:17.536 --> 17:19.788
Quit your whining. I didn't kill him.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.459
He'll have brain damage though.

17:24.418 --> 17:26.712
Oh, really? That's fine then.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.881
Johnny, we can't stay long!

17:28.964 --> 17:31.008
Good point. Then let's get moving.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.847
You're about finished.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.767
Lastly, I'll let you in on a secret.

17:39.850 --> 17:43.353
Right now, I'm lonely and bored.

17:43.437 --> 17:48.859
I'll admit I was happier
when I didn't have all these riches.

17:49.860 --> 17:50.944
However,

17:51.445 --> 17:56.366
I haven't got the slightest intention of
letting any punk upstart take it from me.

17:56.950 --> 17:59.995
Want to know what it's like
when you try to pull that shit?

18:00.079 --> 18:03.457
I'll let your boyfriend know
by using your corpse!

18:08.420 --> 18:09.379
Johnny!

18:13.342 --> 18:17.346
Don't ever trifle with me!

18:30.526 --> 18:34.488
Jeez! Young people today have no respect.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.949
Praetorian! What's up with those crooks?

18:37.032 --> 18:39.493
Haven't you dealt with them yet?

18:40.077 --> 18:42.746
Bring me that cocky young punk.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.541
I've got something I want to show him.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.419
Hey! Answer me!

18:49.503 --> 18:51.338
And where's Miguel?

18:52.422 --> 18:55.300
-What is it?
-Mr. Matts! Where are you now?

18:56.426 --> 18:58.053
It's a huge mess underground!

18:58.137 --> 19:00.514
Praetorian's been smashed up
and the mansion too!

19:00.597 --> 19:01.890
Hurry up and get back here!

19:02.391 --> 19:04.101
The mansion?

19:04.184 --> 19:06.728
I've been in the mansion this whole time.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.064
These strokes…

19:09.648 --> 19:11.984
These strokes are all wrong.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.361
How can that be?

19:16.488 --> 19:18.407
That goddamn bitch!

19:36.884 --> 19:39.303
Hurry! We don't have time to stop!

19:39.887 --> 19:40.804
Got it!

19:53.275 --> 19:54.693
I get it now.

19:54.776 --> 19:58.530
If she used her power in the mansion,
she would have been detected,

19:58.614 --> 20:00.908
but not here.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.368
That foxy bitch!

20:03.952 --> 20:06.955
She had us hallucinating
all the way from the airport!

20:07.956 --> 20:12.044
The whole mansion was a psychic construct!

20:12.127 --> 20:14.046
What seems to be the problem?

20:14.129 --> 20:18.467
You look as if you've been
duped by the mythical trickster fox.

20:21.094 --> 20:23.055
That's not funny!

20:24.181 --> 20:25.807
Piece of shit priest.

20:36.443 --> 20:37.486
Like I told you,

20:37.569 --> 20:41.782
once we were returning from the airport,
they were wrapped around my finger.

20:41.865 --> 20:45.494
Kasey, you've sure got balls.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.412
Weren't you afraid they'd figure it out?

20:47.496 --> 20:51.583
Maybe if I wasn't the best
psychic manipulator in the biz.

20:51.667 --> 20:52.501
Isn't that right?

20:52.584 --> 20:56.213
And you're a supervillain
who follows the rules needed

20:56.296 --> 20:57.881
to use those awesome powers right.

20:58.465 --> 20:59.925
That's not all.

21:00.008 --> 21:02.552
You're the only woman,
not just in the business

21:02.636 --> 21:06.056
but in the whole world,
who'd go this far for her friends.

21:06.765 --> 21:07.933
I love you, baby.

21:08.016 --> 21:10.644
I love you too.

21:11.561 --> 21:14.147
Now we can finally retire.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.190
You bet.

21:19.278 --> 21:23.615
After these villains got their shares,
they went their separate ways.

21:34.376 --> 21:37.379
Each of their shares
was 100 million dollars.

21:37.462 --> 21:42.092
That Johnny told me to chill out
until the heat died down,

21:42.175 --> 21:46.138
but telling a supervillain
to lie low is ludicrous advice.

21:46.763 --> 21:50.892
TK took his family on a trip to East Asia

21:50.976 --> 21:54.062
and bought a fancy yacht with cash.

21:55.772 --> 21:58.650
Forecast invested in a space venture.

21:59.234 --> 22:04.448
He plans on measuring his power
using the weather satellite they launched.

22:07.284 --> 22:10.495
Ghost heard about the worsening
financial woes of Greece,

22:10.579 --> 22:13.123
so he used diplomatic pressure
on the government

22:13.206 --> 22:15.334
to buy up a ton of their land.

22:17.377 --> 22:20.255
That Roddy really surprised everyone.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.631
He poured his entire share

22:21.715 --> 22:25.218
into the development of
a four-dimensional transport system.

22:25.302 --> 22:28.472
His sales pitch
for a time machine wasn't just a ruse.

22:28.555 --> 22:30.891
He actually did earn a doctorate

22:30.974 --> 22:34.603
in temporal physics
from Princeton University.

22:36.897 --> 22:43.403
Meanwhile, Sammy spent everything
on women and liquor.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.575
What about Gladiator, you ask?

22:48.658 --> 22:53.330
He never wanted
to be blackmailed by villains again,

22:53.413 --> 22:57.876
so he confessed everything
to his partner, gained his forgiveness,

22:57.959 --> 23:01.046
and they renewed their wedding vows.

23:01.129 --> 23:04.174
The newlywed life of
this hero became a hot topic,

23:04.257 --> 23:06.051
and his popularity soared.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.470
In the superhero business,

23:08.553 --> 23:12.682
he is still loved as the
most powerful man in the world.

23:13.183 --> 23:14.351
Isn't that awesome?

23:15.435 --> 23:18.438
But Johnny's most brilliant
stroke of genius was

23:18.522 --> 23:20.357
how he dealt with The Bastard.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.528
That guy's tenacity is staggering.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.614
He probably couldn't rest

23:27.697 --> 23:31.076
until he got vengeance on
every last thief who took his money.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.496
Good morning, Tom.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.081
You're early today.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.082
Yeah.

23:39.543 --> 23:42.462
There isn't anything to cover
about The Union of Justice now.

23:50.387 --> 23:53.390
"Electro Boy"?

24:05.402 --> 24:06.278
Tom?

24:08.363 --> 24:12.033
Johnny devised a plan
quite typical for him.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.120
Mr. Matts!

24:15.203 --> 24:17.372
This certainly is a surprise.

24:17.873 --> 24:21.001
Such a disrespectful greeting
at a time like this

24:21.084 --> 24:22.919
shows how cocky you've gotten.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.213
Excuse me?

24:25.797 --> 24:31.011
It appears just taking over
my Network wasn't enough, was it?

24:31.094 --> 24:33.221
How dare you do such a thing.

24:34.055 --> 24:37.225
I guess you felt it was
the appropriate thing for a villain to do

24:37.934 --> 24:41.354
now that you're an ambitious bigshot
surrounded by your henchmen.

24:42.606 --> 24:45.483
But now I'll teach you
just how much greater

24:46.651 --> 24:48.862
a villain I am than you!

24:48.945 --> 24:51.364
I have no idea what you're talking about.

24:51.448 --> 24:55.410
I'm talking about my 800 million dollars!

24:59.873 --> 25:04.669
I'm here to extract compensation
for the money you stole from me.

25:05.420 --> 25:07.339
It's as simple as that.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.425
But… Mr. Matts…

25:29.945 --> 25:32.781
Maybe I should get back into the business.

25:34.241 --> 25:37.661
He framed that damned Salamander
who had forced me into a tight spot.

25:38.286 --> 25:41.581
That was the final touch to the plan.

25:42.123 --> 25:45.335
You see, there is no rule that says
you always have to wear

25:45.418 --> 25:47.963
the same outfits every time.

25:48.630 --> 25:52.717
Now I can spend my money
without a worry in the world.

25:53.301 --> 25:57.264
But a mere
100 million dollars is a tiny sum.

25:57.347 --> 26:00.433
If you spend it on cars,
women, gambling, and wine,

26:00.517 --> 26:02.227
it doesn't last long.

26:02.852 --> 26:03.728
Are you ready, sir?

26:04.437 --> 26:05.814
Hold on a second.

26:07.065 --> 26:09.901
You know, I think I'll put it on red.

26:19.661 --> 26:21.037
This feels great.

26:21.663 --> 26:23.081
Look down there.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.093
Oh, you.

26:35.176 --> 26:36.344
How about it?

26:37.095 --> 26:38.013
Kasey…

26:40.098 --> 26:41.182
I'll think about it.

26:42.892 --> 26:43.893
Right.

28:13.608 --> 28:18.613
