when I was 17.

06:39.150 --> 06:42.180

06:45.490 --> 06:47.590

her clothes one morning,

06:47.590 --> 06:49.190
and she was like,
"I feel funny."

06:49.190 --> 06:50.690
And her heart just stopped.

06:50.690 --> 06:54.100
They tried reviving her,
but it didn't work, so...

06:54.100 --> 06:59.130

That's a pretty rough story.

06:59.140 --> 07:01.300

07:01.300 --> 07:02.640
Do you guys
love each other?

07:02.640 --> 07:04.410

Yeah, without a doubt.

07:04.410 --> 07:05.470

07:05.480 --> 07:06.740
and that I really care
about her.

07:06.740 --> 07:08.440

about how you feel

07:08.450 --> 07:10.210

and where you want to go?

07:10.210 --> 07:11.810

that I'm very passionate

07:11.820 --> 07:13.050

a surgeon.

07:13.050 --> 07:14.350

she understands, like,

07:14.350 --> 07:15.850

07:15.850 --> 07:17.250
Like, at the end of the day,
that's all I want to do.

07:17.250 --> 07:19.150

she could be the one.

07:19.160 --> 07:20.590
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.

07:20.590 --> 07:22.160

taking seriously

07:22.160 --> 07:24.560

that she's not who she is?

07:24.560 --> 07:25.830

07:25.830 --> 07:27.430
I'm trying to be optimistic
about it,

07:27.430 --> 07:30.060

it would suck to be like,

07:30.070 --> 07:32.470

who's not really her."

07:32.470 --> 07:33.900

07:37.340 --> 07:38.610
- Wow.
All right.

07:38.610 --> 07:40.310
- She's cute.
- Yeah, definitely.

07:40.310 --> 07:44.180
- Well, look, we'll start doing
our fancy finger work online

07:44.180 --> 07:45.980
and see what we can find.

07:45.980 --> 07:47.550
- Okay, that sounds like
a plan to me.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.080
- Let's get out of here.

07:50.820 --> 07:52.420
All right, Dylan,
hang in there.

07:52.420 --> 07:53.620
We'll get you through this.

07:53.620 --> 07:55.020
- Take care, guys.
- Bye, man.

07:55.020 --> 07:56.590
<i> I like him.</i>
<i> I like him a lot.</i>

07:56.590 --> 07:58.360
<i> He's very sincere,</i>

07:58.360 --> 07:59.760
very intense.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.160
- My concern is,
he's got all these ambitions

08:02.170 --> 08:04.200
despite everything
he's been through.

08:04.200 --> 08:08.000
You know, he's gonna dedicate
his life to medicine and kids,

08:08.000 --> 08:11.310
and he really has his future
sort of imagined.

08:11.310 --> 08:14.510
And a big part of that
is being with the right person,

08:14.510 --> 08:16.840
and if he loses Ally...

08:16.850 --> 08:19.650
[sighs] What else
is he gonna give up on?

08:19.650 --> 08:21.050
- He has a lot riding on this.

08:24.820 --> 08:26.150
- All right.
- Investigation time.

08:27.660 --> 08:31.260
No, you generally
like it like this.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.460
- Are you sure this is
the way we want to be?

08:33.460 --> 08:35.000
- It would be better--

08:35.000 --> 08:36.460
- Right, it makes more sense
if I'm over there.

08:36.470 --> 08:38.900
- All right.

08:38.900 --> 08:41.900
- Yeah, this is the way
we do it.

08:41.909 --> 08:43.200
All right,
so here's what we got.

08:43.210 --> 08:45.340
We got Dylan, who,
as a 21-year-old,

08:45.340 --> 08:48.440
he's already had very close
family members pass away

08:48.440 --> 08:50.240
<i> in the last four years.</i>

08:50.250 --> 08:53.920
And he's got this hugely
ambitious future planned

08:53.920 --> 08:54.950
for himself

08:54.950 --> 08:57.590
and finally maybe got
his first break,

08:57.590 --> 08:59.120
<i> a woman named Ally.</i>

08:59.120 --> 09:01.490
<i> Somehow, the universe put</i>
<i> this beautiful,</i>

09:01.490 --> 09:03.990
caring, compassionate woman
in front of him,

09:03.990 --> 09:06.360
and he hadn't even considered
that she was fake

09:06.360 --> 09:10.060
until a couple days ago,
when he gets this mystery text.

09:10.070 --> 09:11.100
<i> Who sent that text?</i>

09:11.100 --> 09:12.030
<i> - Was it her?</i>

09:12.040 --> 09:13.600
-<i> Does she live</i>
<i> in Oklahoma?</i>

09:13.600 --> 09:15.040
Does she really work
at a hospital?

09:15.040 --> 09:17.340
- He's gonna be devastated

09:17.340 --> 09:19.370
if she turns out to not be
who she says she is.

09:19.380 --> 09:20.680
- Definitely.
Here we go.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.380
We got an email from Dylan.

09:22.380 --> 09:23.610
Information on Ally.

09:23.610 --> 09:24.910
She lives in Tulsa.

09:24.910 --> 09:27.450
"Also, here's the number
that messaged me."

09:27.450 --> 09:29.150
- It's another Tulsa number.

09:29.150 --> 09:31.150
- Yes, that's right.
Same area code.

09:31.150 --> 09:33.090
Where do you want to start?
Facebook page?

09:33.090 --> 09:34.160
- Sure.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.620
- So just looking
at her Facebook page,

09:35.630 --> 09:37.990
"Studies at Tulsa
Community College."

09:37.990 --> 09:41.330
- She's an intern at
St. Francis Memorial Hospital.

09:41.330 --> 09:42.700
- Scroll through her pics.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.700
- Okay, steal that.
Take that. Take that.

09:44.700 --> 09:46.430
- Here's one with some friends.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.470
- They're not tagged.

09:47.470 --> 09:48.500
- She's tagged.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.700
- She tagged herself.

09:49.710 --> 09:51.070
- Weird.
And another one.

09:51.070 --> 09:53.670
She's got a Texas necklace on.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.710
- Wait a minute.

09:54.710 --> 09:55.780
- Oh, man, look at that.

09:55.780 --> 09:57.010
- Well, wait, time out.

09:57.010 --> 09:58.510
Oklahoma is very close
to Texas.

09:58.510 --> 09:59.950
- It is close,
but it's not Texas.

09:59.950 --> 10:01.350
- Why does she have
a Texas...

10:01.350 --> 10:02.380
both: With a heart?

10:02.390 --> 10:03.520
- Oh, my God.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.920
- She might just have
family in Texas,

10:04.920 --> 10:07.120
but this feels suspicious.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.760
Let's search her photos
and see what we get.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.360
- Pictures, pictures.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.560
- Here we go, first pic.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.760
Nope, no hit.

10:14.760 --> 10:17.400
All right, next pic.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.500
[inhales sharply]

10:18.500 --> 10:19.730
- No hits.

10:19.740 --> 10:21.370
- Picture number three.
- All right.

10:21.370 --> 10:22.740
- Come on.
Come on!

10:22.740 --> 10:24.510
Ooh.
- Uh, no.

10:24.510 --> 10:25.570
- Last two pictures.

10:25.580 --> 10:27.010
- This girl doesn't exist.

10:27.010 --> 10:28.680
- Come on; we need a hit.
- Come on.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.110
Oh!
[sighs]

10:30.110 --> 10:32.250
- All right, so...
- That's a nothing.

10:32.250 --> 10:34.880
The closest lead we got
is the Texas necklace.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.820
- Yeah. All right,
let's go to friends.

10:36.820 --> 10:39.690
- Yeah, what is our
girl-to-boy ratio here?

10:39.690 --> 10:41.760
- Mostly guys.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.260
- Which is always a red flag.

10:44.260 --> 10:45.260
- It is.

10:45.260 --> 10:47.660
Lots of photos with friends,

10:47.660 --> 10:49.430
but no friends are tagged.

10:49.430 --> 10:51.700
She's only got 300 friends.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.000
There's not a lot.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.900
Her profile right now
is ranking pretty high

10:54.900 --> 10:56.470
on the Catfish-o-meter.

10:56.470 --> 10:57.870
- Yeah.
- All right.

10:57.870 --> 10:59.540
So should we just reach out
to some of the people?

10:59.540 --> 11:01.110
- Yeah.

11:01.110 --> 11:02.140
Jay [bleep].

11:02.150 --> 11:04.780
- Okay, he seems to be
sort of legit.

11:04.780 --> 11:05.780
- Hit him up.

11:05.780 --> 11:07.520
- Mason [bleep].

11:07.520 --> 11:08.550
Let's send him a message.

11:08.550 --> 11:10.380
#JerseyGirl.
It's a girl.

11:10.390 --> 11:13.320
Send her a message.

11:13.320 --> 11:16.060
Okay, should we search
her phone number?

11:16.060 --> 11:16.960
- Yes!

11:16.960 --> 11:18.930
- Okay, search, baby,
search.

11:18.930 --> 11:20.830
<i> [suspenseful music]</i>

11:20.830 --> 11:22.600
- Oh.
- Look, Mark [bleep].

11:22.600 --> 11:23.860
Who's Mark [bleep]?

11:23.870 --> 11:25.430
- Click on that.

11:25.440 --> 11:26.800
- Early 40s.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.400
Mark could be
Ally's dad.

11:29.410 --> 11:30.840
- Right, totally.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.210
- Wait.
What's this?

11:32.210 --> 11:33.110
Phone complaint?

11:33.110 --> 11:34.580
- What's a phone complaint?

11:34.580 --> 11:35.580
- I've never seen that before.

11:35.580 --> 11:37.880
"This is a spoofed number."

11:37.880 --> 11:40.180
- "Trick your caller ID
to display

11:40.180 --> 11:43.280
an incorrect phone number
to avoid complaints."

11:43.290 --> 11:44.520
- That's so weird.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.990
- Let's look up
the other phone number.

11:46.990 --> 11:48.220
This is the phone number

11:48.220 --> 11:50.890
he got
the weird message from.

11:50.890 --> 11:52.490
Here we go.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.590
Oh, we got a hit.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.230
- Whoa!
C. [bleep].

11:55.230 --> 11:56.630
- Does it give us
an address?

11:56.630 --> 11:57.930
- No, Tulsa.

11:57.930 --> 11:59.870
- All right, both in Tulsa.

11:59.870 --> 12:00.900
[computer ringing]
Oh!

12:00.900 --> 12:02.700
- Oh, Lubbock, Texas.

12:02.710 --> 12:05.370
- Whoa!
Texas necklace.

12:05.370 --> 12:06.910
- Hello?

12:06.910 --> 12:08.410
Yeah, hey, what's up?
Who's this?

12:09.510 --> 12:11.050
- Hey.
How you doing, Jay?

12:11.050 --> 12:13.410
Thanks for getting back
to us.

12:13.420 --> 12:14.720
We're doing a story now,

12:14.720 --> 12:16.380
and we're looking into
this girl Ally

12:16.390 --> 12:19.520
that we noticed
you're following on Instagram

12:19.520 --> 12:21.620
and have sort of
communicated with

12:21.620 --> 12:23.120
via comments.

12:27.030 --> 12:28.730
- Have you ever met her
in person?

12:33.370 --> 12:34.870
- What happened?

12:38.440 --> 12:39.940
- Ireland?

12:41.010 --> 12:42.440
- And how long
did you guys talk

12:42.450 --> 12:44.950
before you found out
it wasn't her?

12:51.420 --> 12:54.920
- Wow, she said, "Sorry,
I'm actually not that girl;

12:54.920 --> 12:56.820
I'm really Ally"?

12:57.630 --> 12:59.390
- Did you guys continue

12:59.400 --> 13:00.830
a relationship?

13:00.830 --> 13:03.730
Was there still sort of
a romantic element?

13:12.240 --> 13:13.370
- Wow.

13:13.380 --> 13:16.810
- Has she ever mentioned
a guy named Dylan?

13:17.810 --> 13:19.250
- Right.
All right, well, cool.

13:19.250 --> 13:21.920
Thanks for getting back to us.
We appreciate it.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.650
- All right, Jay.
- Thanks, Jay.

13:24.650 --> 13:25.820
- See ya.

13:25.820 --> 13:27.390
So hold on.
Time out.

13:27.390 --> 13:28.290
- Wait a minute.

13:28.290 --> 13:30.760
- So as long
as four years ago...

13:30.760 --> 13:32.190
- She was someone else.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.130
- Who knows
what else she's been?

13:34.130 --> 13:36.830
The only consistent
pieces of information...

13:36.830 --> 13:37.970
- Tulsa.

13:37.970 --> 13:39.430
The area codes.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.700
Even the guys who are text--
the mystery texters

13:42.710 --> 13:43.900
are from Tulsa.

13:43.910 --> 13:44.940
- I guess we're going
to Tulsa.

13:44.940 --> 13:46.110
- Okay.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.180
- Let's do this.

13:50.910 --> 13:52.910
[doorbell rings]

13:52.920 --> 13:54.420
- Yo.
- Yeah.

13:54.420 --> 13:56.050
- What up, man?
- How's it going?

13:56.050 --> 13:57.590
- What's up?
- Is this your spot?

13:57.590 --> 13:59.750
- Yup, this is where
I'm crashing at right now.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.390
- Cool.
All right.

14:01.390 --> 14:03.590
Let's go over the results
of the investigation.

14:03.590 --> 14:06.490
- All right, so we started
with a quick check

14:06.500 --> 14:08.360
on her profile, okay?

14:08.360 --> 14:10.830
We went through her photos,

14:10.830 --> 14:12.970
and we did an image search.

14:12.970 --> 14:14.240
We didn't get any hits.

14:14.240 --> 14:15.870
On one hand,
that's kind of good,

14:15.870 --> 14:19.210
'cause it means that this is
just sort of a normal person.

14:19.210 --> 14:22.980
But as we were going
through her Facebook profile

14:22.980 --> 14:23.980
and looking at the photos,

14:23.980 --> 14:26.180
one thing that stood out

14:26.180 --> 14:29.220
in this picture
is her necklace.

14:29.220 --> 14:30.720
- Texas?

14:30.720 --> 14:33.220
- You hadn't noticed.
- I haven't noticed that.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.220
- In a couple photos...
- In a lot of her pictures.

14:35.220 --> 14:36.920
- She's got this necklace on.

14:36.930 --> 14:39.130
Now, she could just love...
- Oklahoma's next to Texas.

14:39.130 --> 14:40.760
- Oklahoma's
next to Texas.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.130
She might just love Texas,
might have family in Texas.

14:43.130 --> 14:44.870
But the point is,
this girl lives

14:44.870 --> 14:46.800
or spends a lot of time
in Texas.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.540
- I've never heard her mention
her going down to Texas.

14:49.540 --> 14:50.670
- Not a good sign.

14:50.670 --> 14:52.940
All right, so this is when
we transitioned

14:52.940 --> 14:54.240
into the phone numbers.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.810
We ran her phone number,

14:56.810 --> 14:57.850
and this is weird.

14:57.850 --> 14:59.180
We've never seen this.

14:59.180 --> 15:01.580
The first thing that comes up
is a complaint.

15:01.580 --> 15:02.950
And after you scroll down

15:02.950 --> 15:05.250
past what it thinks
is the registered owner,

15:05.250 --> 15:07.250
which is Mark [bleep]--

15:07.260 --> 15:08.860
Any bells ringing
on that?

15:08.860 --> 15:10.390
- No.

15:10.390 --> 15:13.090
- After that, when you go down
to phone complaints,

15:13.100 --> 15:16.100
it says, "This is
a spoofed number."

15:16.100 --> 15:17.800
- What's spoofed num--
what is that?

15:17.800 --> 15:21.940
- I guess that's something
where you trick the caller ID.

15:21.940 --> 15:23.440
It's a fake number.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.210
- Here's where it gets weird.

15:25.210 --> 15:26.940
When we searched
the number that texted you

15:26.940 --> 15:28.910
that Ally's not real,

15:28.910 --> 15:31.280
we got a hit,
C [bleep].

15:31.280 --> 15:33.050
- You ever heard
that name before?

15:33.050 --> 15:34.380
- No.

15:34.380 --> 15:37.180
- All right, so the last place
we went to look

15:37.190 --> 15:38.490
was her Instagram.

15:38.490 --> 15:40.790
We went to the profiles
of a few people

15:40.790 --> 15:42.590
that were engaging with Ally.

15:42.590 --> 15:44.220
One guy is Jay.

15:44.230 --> 15:46.030
They had a few messages
on a couple pictures,

15:46.030 --> 15:47.730
no big deal.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.340
Now, Jay met Ally online
four years ago.

15:57.340 --> 15:59.370
Her name wasn't Ally.

15:59.380 --> 16:01.710
She was going by "Ireland."

16:01.710 --> 16:05.050
- Blonde girl, blue eyes,
not the same picture.

16:05.050 --> 16:07.310
- And after a couple months
of talking,

16:07.320 --> 16:10.920
she revealed, "Sorry,
I've been lying to you.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.690

you've been seeing."

16:22.530 --> 16:27.300
- Why open up
another fake Facebook account

another big red flag.

I saw your text

and I was curious

19:08.530 --> 19:09.730
what you know about her.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.830

33:45.470 --> 33:48.410
that you're willing
to risk life and limb

33:48.510 --> 33:51.040
to pretend to be
this other person?

33:51.150 --> 33:53.050
'Cause maybe it is.
Maybe it is that good.

33:53.150 --> 33:54.910
Maybe it's just worth it.

33:55.020 --> 33:56.520
- I mean, I don't like
talking about it,

33:56.620 --> 33:58.120
'cause I know
it's looked down upon.

33:58.220 --> 34:00.090
- Well, but take that away
for a second.

34:00.190 --> 34:01.450
I'm just curious.

34:01.560 --> 34:03.090
How does it feel
when you are going online

34:03.190 --> 34:07.790
and pretending to be Ally...

34:07.900 --> 34:09.360
- I mean that makes me feel bad
that

34:09.460 --> 34:13.170
I have to pretend to be someone
to feel like I am good enough

34:13.270 --> 34:14.900
but it makes me feel good like
to have that someone

34:15.000 --> 34:18.840
be there to want to talk to me

34:18.940 --> 34:21.639
I've been told I was worthless,

34:21.739 --> 34:25.010
and I was really bullied
in high school really bad.

34:25.110 --> 34:27.580
It got to the point--
I was a basketball manager.

34:27.679 --> 34:29.179
I had one basketball team,

34:29.280 --> 34:31.750
like, their whole
basketball team stood up

34:31.850 --> 34:32.850
and called me a cow

34:32.949 --> 34:33.850
as I was walking
across the thing

34:33.960 --> 34:35.050
and mooed at me.

34:35.159 --> 34:36.659
And then they found
my Instagram,

34:36.760 --> 34:38.460
and it just went on.

34:38.560 --> 34:40.230
I've been told
that I should kill myself

34:40.330 --> 34:42.300
by multiple people
in my school.

34:42.400 --> 34:45.100
And so I just got to the point

34:45.199 --> 34:46.600
that I listened
to what everyone said,

34:46.699 --> 34:50.699
because I felt like
that's what was true about me.

34:50.810 --> 34:53.540
- So on a daily basis,

34:53.639 --> 34:55.440
that replays in your head
a lot.

34:55.540 --> 34:56.880
- Yeah, the bullying
and everything.

34:56.980 --> 34:58.580
- The basketball teams.
- Yeah.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.380
- And that's why you're addicted
to this internet stuff:

35:01.480 --> 35:05.280
because for a second,
it gives you this high.

35:05.390 --> 35:06.450
Right?

35:06.550 --> 35:07.450
How does it feel

35:07.560 --> 35:09.620
when you're talking
to a new guy

35:09.720 --> 35:12.590
who just reached out to you
on social media?

35:12.690 --> 35:15.430
- Yeah, it feels good
when they, like, compliment me

35:15.530 --> 35:18.000
and then, like, they slide
into my DMs, I guess.

35:18.100 --> 35:20.300
Are you excited?
Yeah.
Are you like nervous?

35:20.400 --> 35:22.540
Oh, sometimes I get nervous

35:22.640 --> 35:24.340
I feel bad
that I'm doing this to someone,

35:24.440 --> 35:26.340
but at the same,
it's just like

35:26.440 --> 35:28.510
I'm being selfish about it.

35:28.610 --> 35:30.310
- When you're talking about it,
it sounds like

35:30.410 --> 35:31.810
it's always, like, tainted.

35:31.910 --> 35:33.110
- Yeah.

35:33.210 --> 35:35.210
Like, when they call me "Ally"
or something,

35:35.320 --> 35:37.280
and then I'm like,
"That's not my name."

35:37.390 --> 35:40.190
Or, like, if I'm with a friend
and my friend says, "Mary"

35:40.290 --> 35:41.550
and they're like,
"Who's Mary?"

35:41.660 --> 35:44.490
And I'm like--the guiltiness
kicks in real good.

35:44.590 --> 35:46.330
- So for a second,
it makes you feel good,

35:46.430 --> 35:48.960
but then there's
all this bull[bleep] around it

35:49.060 --> 35:51.200
that ruins it all.

35:51.300 --> 35:53.270
You have to feel bad
that you messed with him,

35:53.370 --> 35:55.130
and then you got to deal
with your annoying cousin

35:55.240 --> 35:57.740
who's always blowing up
your spot

35:57.840 --> 35:58.770
and telling people.

35:58.870 --> 36:00.140
I mean, like, I think

36:00.240 --> 36:02.480
you've got to approach this
differently.

36:02.580 --> 36:06.480
What you don't like, clearly,
is feeling bad about yourself.

36:06.580 --> 36:09.720
But what are the things
that you do like?

36:09.820 --> 36:13.120
Where, on your daily life,
do you experience

36:13.220 --> 36:15.890
the most confidence
and power and joy?

36:15.990 --> 36:17.090
- Um...

36:17.190 --> 36:18.660
like, when I bake stuff
for people

36:18.760 --> 36:20.290
and they're like, "Oh,
my gosh, this is so good.

36:20.400 --> 36:22.130
You should"--like,
she tells me all the time,

36:22.230 --> 36:23.630
like, "Please make
more food."

36:23.730 --> 36:27.400
- So baking is something
that makes you feel good.

36:27.500 --> 36:29.570
- Yeah, I love baking.

36:29.670 --> 36:31.270
- That's kind of like
a win-win.

36:31.370 --> 36:33.910
Like, you do this thing
you love, and then...

36:34.010 --> 36:35.470
- It makes you feel good...

36:35.580 --> 36:37.140
- It makes other people...
- Doesn't hurt anyone.

36:37.250 --> 36:38.880
- And it makes other people
feel good.

36:38.980 --> 36:40.350
And, like, the--it gets--

36:40.450 --> 36:42.520
the positivity
kind of comes back to you.

36:42.620 --> 36:45.080
So there's cooking...
- Mm-hmm.

36:45.190 --> 36:46.420
- Which is kind of pure joy.

36:46.520 --> 36:47.890
And then there's
the catfish stuff,

36:47.990 --> 36:51.160
which has that element
of guilt with it, right?

36:51.260 --> 36:52.590
- Yeah.

36:52.690 --> 36:54.430
- So it's like
which one of those feelings

36:54.530 --> 36:56.860
do you want to invest in?

36:56.970 --> 36:58.100
- I want the joy one more,

36:58.200 --> 37:00.870
because then I'll feel
joy and happiness,

37:00.970 --> 37:02.470
and I won't be lying
to everyone,

37:02.570 --> 37:05.710
and I can just, you know,
be my own person.

37:07.380 --> 37:09.680
- Once you sort of
give yourself the opportunity

37:09.780 --> 37:12.750
to consider
that you are worthwhile

37:12.850 --> 37:14.410
and that you have things
that you're good at

37:14.520 --> 37:16.720
that bring you
and other people happiness,

37:16.820 --> 37:20.620
it's amazing how quickly
you can sort of...

37:20.720 --> 37:22.820
- Reset.
- Reset.

37:22.920 --> 37:23.960
- I want to be your friend.

37:24.060 --> 37:25.320
I want to be there for you,

37:25.430 --> 37:26.530
and I want
to help you get through this,

37:26.630 --> 37:29.160
but the catfishing
has to stop.

37:29.260 --> 37:30.330
Like, I'll help you,

37:30.430 --> 37:32.230
but you have to try to stop it.

37:32.330 --> 37:34.170
Just do you.

37:34.270 --> 37:35.970
- Mm-hmm.

37:36.070 --> 37:38.700
- Make the most
of this opportunity.

37:38.810 --> 37:42.780
This happened because two people
who care about you,

37:42.880 --> 37:45.680
Chelsee and Dylan,
made this happen.

37:45.780 --> 37:49.750
Use it as best you can
to change things.

37:49.850 --> 37:52.320
- Yeah, I want to do it.

37:52.420 --> 37:54.490
- All right.
- All right.

37:54.590 --> 37:56.760
- We're gonna leave.
- Mm-hmm.

37:56.860 --> 37:58.120
- So it'll be on you.

37:58.230 --> 37:59.430
- Yeah.

37:59.530 --> 38:01.930
Well, I mean,
I want to be happier.

38:06.700 --> 38:08.670
