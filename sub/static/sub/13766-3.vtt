WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:05.547
And then there's a big

00:03.170 --> 00:05.547
explosion and lots of bubbles.

00:05.589 --> 00:07.633
That's where

00:05.589 --> 00:07.633
babies come from.

00:07.675 --> 00:10.051
(laughing)

00:10.093 --> 00:12.930
Oh, well, you know,

00:10.093 --> 00:12.930
close enough.

00:12.972 --> 00:15.140
I did the math once.

00:15.182 --> 00:18.059
It turns out,

00:15.182 --> 00:18.059
every 17.4 dinners,

00:18.101 --> 00:20.479
my family actually has

00:18.101 --> 00:20.479
a pleasant meal together.

00:20.521 --> 00:21.438
Hey, look at this.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.565
I made a pea angel.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.651
Oh, you're a pea angel.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.068
Stop playing with your food.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.030
(laughter)

00:31.573 --> 00:34.075
Oh, Mom...

00:34.117 --> 00:35.285
Don't you dare.

00:35.327 --> 00:36.954
Relax, I wasn't

00:35.327 --> 00:36.954
really going to.

00:36.996 --> 00:38.079
Then don't.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.122
I wasn't going to.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.082
Then don't.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.376
Well, don't accuse me

00:41.124 --> 00:42.376
of something

00:42.417 --> 00:43.836
that I wasn't going to do.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.089
Interesting mood shift.

00:48.131 --> 00:51.092
It would take hours to explain

00:48.131 --> 00:51.092
the psychology behind this.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.094
So let me just put it this way:

00:53.136 --> 00:54.388
dynamite...

00:54.429 --> 00:56.097
kid with matches.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.808
You're going to throw

00:56.139 --> 00:57.808
that at Mom?

00:57.850 --> 00:59.560
I wasn't going to.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.102
Oh, geez Louise. Reese...

01:01.144 --> 01:02.103
Hal, I can handle this.

01:02.145 --> 01:04.815
Reese, I'm warning you.

01:04.857 --> 01:06.107
I wasn't going to.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.318
But if you think I would,

01:06.149 --> 01:08.318
then maybe I should.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.362
Oh, good.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.362
Now he's panicking.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.908
Just put the spoon down

01:10.404 --> 01:13.908
and apologize.

01:13.949 --> 01:16.117
Okay, she gave

01:13.949 --> 01:16.117
him an out.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.118
Apologize for what?

01:17.160 --> 01:18.370
I wasn't going

01:17.160 --> 01:18.370
to do anything.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.621
Just stop talking!

01:19.663 --> 01:21.122
Just stop talking

01:19.663 --> 01:21.122
and let me think!

01:21.164 --> 01:22.750
Dad, do something.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.960
I got it.

01:39.391 --> 01:42.394
What do you think you're doing?

01:44.187 --> 01:46.105
I'm being cute and spontaneous?

01:49.568 --> 01:51.904
(laughs)

01:53.781 --> 01:55.365
(laughing)

01:57.576 --> 01:59.119
Ker-splat!

02:02.205 --> 02:04.165
Don't do it.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.627
I wasn't going to.

02:06.668 --> 02:09.546
Yep, this is

02:06.668 --> 02:09.546
a good dinner.

Yeah?

03:00.263 --> 03:02.641
Can I see you for a minute,

03:00.263 --> 03:02.641
please?

03:02.683 --> 03:04.518
STUDENTS:

03:02.683 --> 03:04.518
Ooh!

03:04.559 --> 03:06.728
BOY:

03:04.559 --> 03:06.728
Teacher's favorite.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.229
Teacher's pet.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.942
"Dear...  Penthouse..."

03:11.984 --> 03:14.235
"Yesterday I pushed

03:11.984 --> 03:14.235
my friend Stevie

03:14.277 --> 03:15.236
down some stairs."

03:15.278 --> 03:18.448
Point... taken.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.162
What?

03:23.202 --> 03:25.246
Malcolm, I'm

03:23.202 --> 03:25.246
a little concerned.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.248
You're doing very well

03:25.288 --> 03:27.248
in your studies,

03:27.290 --> 03:30.251
but... I still sense

03:30.293 --> 03:32.420
an emotional distance

03:30.293 --> 03:32.420
between us,

03:32.462 --> 03:34.756
and I hate it.

03:34.798 --> 03:38.259
I'd really like us

03:34.798 --> 03:38.259
to try to connect

03:38.301 --> 03:39.469
on a deeper level.

03:39.511 --> 03:42.263
Whoa. She  is  coming on to me.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.265
I thought you were

03:42.305 --> 03:44.265
dating the janitor.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.267
Who told you that?

03:46.309 --> 03:47.769
God. One drink and...

03:47.811 --> 03:48.937
Never mind.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.773
What I am trying to say is

03:51.815 --> 03:54.275
I know your parents.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.278
I know you have

03:54.317 --> 03:57.278
a colorful home life.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.281
So, just remember, if you ever

03:57.320 --> 04:00.281
need anything at all--

04:00.323 --> 04:02.784
a sympathetic ear,

04:00.323 --> 04:02.784
a shoulder to cry on--

04:02.826 --> 04:05.996
I want you to come to me.

04:06.038 --> 04:09.917
Yeah. That's what

04:06.038 --> 04:09.917
I need-- another mom.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.292
Okay. Great.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.292
Okay.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.293
Thanks a lot.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.295
Well, I got to go

04:14.337 --> 04:15.923
do the... thing.

04:17.216 --> 04:19.176
And then I drew

04:17.216 --> 04:19.176
a robot, Francis.

04:19.218 --> 04:20.343
But my crayon broke.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.137
And then I had

04:20.385 --> 04:22.137
a popsicle.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.180
I mean,

04:23.222 --> 04:24.305
I had 12 popsicles.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.307
You like popsicles,

04:24.347 --> 04:26.307
Francis?

04:26.349 --> 04:28.351
Shut up, Dewey.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.351
Stop bugging Francis.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.978
I'm so glad you're home.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.605
You don't know

04:30.020 --> 04:31.605
what it's like

04:31.646 --> 04:33.774
dealing with these

04:31.646 --> 04:33.774
little kids all day.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.609
It's the coolest thing.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.570
It's the first time Francis

04:35.650 --> 04:38.570
is home from military school.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.781
Mom and Dad are going off

04:38.612 --> 04:40.781
to some wedding,

04:40.822 --> 04:43.575
and Francis is in charge of us

04:40.822 --> 04:43.575
for the whole weekend.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.368
I can't believe how much

04:43.617 --> 04:45.368
I missed him.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.578
Hey.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.788
Huh.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.790
He's so great.

04:49.831 --> 04:54.253
Boys! The number for the hotel

04:49.831 --> 04:54.253
is on the counter.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.420
I left money for pizza,

04:55.462 --> 04:58.966
but I want a receipt

04:55.462 --> 04:58.966
and exact change.

04:59.007 --> 05:02.343
Yep, that underwear

04:59.007 --> 05:02.343
is going to wrinkle.

05:02.385 --> 05:05.346
You know, it's kind of

05:02.385 --> 05:05.346
nice having Francis

05:05.388 --> 05:07.015
back in the house,

05:05.388 --> 05:07.015
don't you think?

05:07.057 --> 05:08.016
(chuckling)

05:08.058 --> 05:09.017
What?

05:09.059 --> 05:11.228
Nothing. You're just cute

05:11.270 --> 05:12.854
when you think

05:11.270 --> 05:12.854
you're being subtle.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.649
Really?

05:15.690 --> 05:18.193
Of course it's nice

05:15.690 --> 05:18.193
having Francis home.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.861
Well, it's been

05:18.235 --> 05:19.861
a few months now.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.363
Maybe it's time to, you know,

05:19.903 --> 05:22.363
think about it.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.824
I don't know. Maybe.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.868
We'll see how he

05:23.865 --> 05:26.868
does this weekend.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.788
God, I hate this hairdo.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.372
I don't even know

05:29.830 --> 05:31.372
why I bother

05:31.414 --> 05:33.041
trying to impress

05:31.414 --> 05:33.041
your family anymore.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.375
They've always hated me.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.961
Well, you are

05:34.417 --> 05:35.961
the one who stole

05:36.003 --> 05:38.337
their little Hally

05:36.003 --> 05:38.337
away from them.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.383
Better get moving.

05:42.425 --> 05:43.635
And then it got away.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.470
But I found another one,

05:43.677 --> 05:45.470
but it died.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.014
And then...

05:47.055 --> 05:48.640
I said leave him alone,

05:47.055 --> 05:48.640
you butt-munch.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.641
Let me go.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.684
Make me.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.103
(Dewey and Reese yelling)

05:54.646 --> 05:57.024
Guys, quit it.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.859
Listen for a second.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.401
I just heard Mom and Dad.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.612
They're thinking about

06:00.443 --> 06:02.612
letting Francis come home.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.325
You serious?

06:06.365 --> 06:07.408
Yeah. They want to see

06:07.450 --> 06:09.203
how he does with us

06:07.450 --> 06:09.203
this weekend.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.411
Okay? So we

06:09.244 --> 06:10.411
can't screw up.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.412
Cool.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.040
Let's go tell him.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.040
No.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.583
You know how Francis gets when

06:13.081 --> 06:15.583
people tell him what to do.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.418
I am warning you.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.420
If you get your

06:17.460 --> 06:19.420
nose pierced,

06:19.462 --> 06:20.797
you are going

06:19.462 --> 06:20.797
to military school.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.300
And I mean it. Really.

06:23.342 --> 06:25.384
Do you hear me?

06:26.385 --> 06:28.055
Hey, Mom.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.640
What's for dinner?

06:30.682 --> 06:32.226
Right.

06:32.267 --> 06:33.434
What are we going to do?

06:33.476 --> 06:35.270
We're going to be good,

06:33.476 --> 06:35.270
that's what.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.479
How do we be good?

06:36.521 --> 06:37.939
I don't know.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.234
Honestly, it's never

06:37.981 --> 06:40.234
come up before.

06:40.275 --> 06:42.319
Look, we're just not

06:40.275 --> 06:42.319
going to do anything.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.321
That way, we can't

06:42.361 --> 06:44.321
get in any trouble.

06:44.363 --> 06:45.822
HAL:

06:44.363 --> 06:45.822
Honey.

06:45.864 --> 06:48.449
We're late.

06:45.864 --> 06:48.449
We better hit the road.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.161
Fine. I'll shave my

06:48.491 --> 06:51.161
legs in the car.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.121
Okay. I've marked

06:51.203 --> 06:53.121
all the liquor bottles,

06:53.163 --> 06:54.706
and we can taste when

06:53.163 --> 06:54.706
they're watered down.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.499
I've locked out the

06:54.748 --> 06:56.499
smut channel on the TV,

06:56.541 --> 06:58.126
counted your

06:56.541 --> 06:58.126
father's cigars.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.460
I've checked the odometer

06:58.168 --> 06:59.460
on the car.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.088
I know the exact balance

06:59.502 --> 07:01.088
of all our credit cards.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.547
We love you.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.547
Have a good time.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.465
And just remember,

07:02.589 --> 07:04.465
Dewey will tell us

07:04.507 --> 07:06.260
everything you did

07:04.507 --> 07:06.260
while we're gone.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.469
Uh, what your

07:06.301 --> 07:08.469
mother said, boys.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.430
Minus one.

07:14.309 --> 07:18.146
Don't even think about it.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.690
Think about what?

07:20.732 --> 07:22.483
She's bluffing.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.485
Okay, I am going

07:22.525 --> 07:24.485
to show you guys

07:24.527 --> 07:25.987
the coolest thing

07:24.527 --> 07:25.987
you have ever seen.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.530
Get me some

07:26.029 --> 07:27.530
lighter fluid,

07:27.572 --> 07:30.284
a waffle iron and one of

07:27.572 --> 07:30.284
Dewey's stuffed animals.

07:30.325 --> 07:31.952
The furrier, the better.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.329
Actually, we're

07:31.993 --> 07:34.329
kind of tired.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.663
Tired?

07:35.705 --> 07:37.874
Yeah. Tired.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.500
I'm not tired.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.503
Okay, yeah, I'm tired.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.381
Let's just go

07:42.545 --> 07:44.381
watch TV.

07:44.423 --> 07:47.426
Whatever.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.428
ANNOUNCER (over TV):

07:47.467 --> 07:49.428
...lines up his shot.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.889
I've never seen this kind

07:49.469 --> 07:52.889
of excitement...

07:52.931 --> 07:54.515
This plan better work.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.726
The only thing worse than no TV

07:56.768 --> 07:58.895
is golf on TV.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.356
Oh, come on, guys.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.356
Let's go outside.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.523
Let's go do something.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.525
No. They're only

08:02.565 --> 08:04.525
on the sixth hole.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.821
They're only on the sixth hole.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.530
(telephone rings)

08:09.572 --> 08:10.991
Hello.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.410
Francis, bud, I heard you

08:11.032 --> 08:13.410
were in town.

08:13.452 --> 08:14.744
You da man, Francis!

08:14.786 --> 08:17.538
Hey, guys, what's going on?

08:17.580 --> 08:19.916
Same old,

08:17.580 --> 08:19.916
same old, man.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.335
(grunting)

08:21.376 --> 08:23.544
Oh, Circus says hi.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.839
Dude, you're not

08:23.586 --> 08:25.839
going to believe it.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.548
I finally moved out.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.050
I'm living in the

08:27.590 --> 08:29.050
basement now.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.551
Total freedom, dude.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.137
You da man, Francis!

08:32.179 --> 08:35.807
Mom, you're

08:32.179 --> 08:35.807
supposed to knock.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.392
Dude, we're coming over.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.560
Okay. Hey, Richie and the guys

08:37.434 --> 08:39.560
are coming over.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.146
Maybe they shouldn't.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.564
You know, Mom and Dad

08:41.188 --> 08:43.564
are gone.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.566
Okay, got it.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.566
Hey, Richie, listen to me.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.986
I'm watching my brothers,

08:45.608 --> 08:47.986
so we got to hang here.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.570
And no parties, okay?

08:49.612 --> 08:51.031
I'm serious.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.657
It's got to be

08:51.072 --> 08:52.657
just the three of you.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.578
Huh. You wouldn't think

08:55.618 --> 08:57.578
only three guys

08:57.620 --> 08:59.247
could do so much damage.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.249
Call us next time

08:59.289 --> 09:01.249
you're in town.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.168
You da man, Francis!

09:16.515 --> 09:18.266
I can't believe we're

09:16.515 --> 09:18.266
going to this wedding.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.600
What a waste of time.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.602
Oh, come on, I promise

09:19.642 --> 09:21.602
it'll be fun.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.188
Hal, I'm not Dewey.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.232
Sorry. But still,

09:23.230 --> 09:25.232
we're alone,

09:25.273 --> 09:27.275
we're away from the kids.

09:27.317 --> 09:30.862
Right now, we're just two

09:27.317 --> 09:30.862
unencumbered consenting adults.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.614
I say we enjoy it.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.075
Yeah, you're right.

09:35.116 --> 09:38.537
It will be nice to have some

09:35.116 --> 09:38.537
time for just the two of us.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.080
And I'm going to love

09:38.578 --> 09:40.080
not having

09:40.121 --> 09:43.291
to yell at somebody

09:40.121 --> 09:43.291
every 20 seconds.

09:43.333 --> 09:47.628
Either speed up or get

09:43.333 --> 09:47.628
off the road, jackass!

09:47.670 --> 09:50.173
Absolutely deserved it.

09:52.884 --> 09:55.636
(spits)

09:52.884 --> 09:55.636
I hate those guys.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.056
Did you see Circus break

09:55.678 --> 09:58.056
that cinder block with his head?

09:58.098 --> 09:59.640
That's a good lesson

09:58.098 --> 09:59.640
for you guys.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.309
It didn't break

09:59.682 --> 10:01.309
the first six times.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.603
But did he quit trying?

10:01.351 --> 10:03.603
No, sir.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.356
Francis, we have

10:04.687 --> 10:06.356
to clean this up.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.566
Yeah.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.691
No. I mean now.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.651
If Mom and Dad see this,

10:08.733 --> 10:10.651
they'll freak.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.946
So what else is new?

10:10.693 --> 10:12.946
They always freak.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.364
I'm used to it.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.364
No!

10:14.406 --> 10:16.157
This is different.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.157
We have to clean up.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.159
Okay, what's with you guys?

10:16.199 --> 10:18.159
I'm in charge here.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.328
I'm the only one who's going to

10:18.201 --> 10:20.328
get in trouble. Just relax.

10:20.370 --> 10:21.871
But we want you to come home.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.706
What?

10:23.748 --> 10:25.666
I heard Mom and Dad talking.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.961
This weekend is like

10:25.708 --> 10:27.961
a test for you. Or a trap.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.670
If you do good,

10:28.002 --> 10:29.670
they may let you come home.

10:29.712 --> 10:30.755
And if you don't,

10:30.797 --> 10:31.923
they're going to toss your butt

10:31.965 --> 10:32.924
back into military school.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.384
Okay, look...

10:32.966 --> 10:34.384
Francis,

10:34.426 --> 10:35.885
it sucks around

10:34.426 --> 10:35.885
here without you.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.555
Can't you just

10:35.927 --> 10:38.555
try for our sake?

10:38.597 --> 10:41.308
Look, guys, I appreciate

10:38.597 --> 10:41.308
your sentiment.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.393
But they're not going

10:41.349 --> 10:43.393
to decide my whole future

10:43.435 --> 10:45.186
based on how I behave

10:43.435 --> 10:45.186
over one weekend

10:45.228 --> 10:46.896
without even telling me

10:45.228 --> 10:46.896
about it.

10:46.938 --> 10:49.399
It's too arbitrary.

10:46.938 --> 10:49.399
It's unreasonable.

10:49.441 --> 10:50.691
It's Mom.

12:08.603 --> 12:10.980

driving 600 miles for.

It's the groom, Hal.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.791

Reese, give me the ice!

13:24.387 --> 13:25.846
Come on.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.515
We don't have any ice.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.515
We got this.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.309
Fine. Give me some antiseptic.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.561

13:29.350 --> 13:31.561

Hello.

13:32.811 --> 13:34.897
Hi, Dewey.

13:32.811 --> 13:34.897
Hi, Mom.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.232
Hi. We're just calling

13:34.939 --> 13:36.232
to check in.

13:36.274 --> 13:37.442
Let me speak with Francis.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.610
He's...

13:39.902 --> 13:41.237
...in the bathroom.

13:41.279 --> 13:42.697
Oh. Well, let me talk

13:41.279 --> 13:42.697
to Malcolm.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.865
He's in the bathroom.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.075
They're both in the bathroom?

13:46.117 --> 13:47.661
What are they doing in there?

13:47.702 --> 13:49.746
I have to go to the bathroom.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.875
We have to get you stitches.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.875
Let's go to the hospital.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.961
No! You can't. Mom and

13:54.917 --> 13:56.961
Dad will find out.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.797
Malcolm,

13:57.003 --> 13:58.797
this is a head injury.

13:58.837 --> 14:00.757
You could have a concussion.

14:00.799 --> 14:03.301
Concussion? I think

14:00.799 --> 14:03.301
he's making too much of this.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.304
I'm not as figgled

14:03.343 --> 14:06.304
as he hoogers.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.807
No! I don't care.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.807
I'm not going to the hospital.

14:08.847 --> 14:09.890
Do you hear me?

14:09.932 --> 14:11.726
There is no way that I...

14:11.768 --> 14:13.645
Get the car.

14:16.606 --> 14:17.898
I can't see anything.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.067
Do you want to get blood

14:17.940 --> 14:20.067
all over the car?

14:20.109 --> 14:22.570
Wait! We can't take the car.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.570
They'll know.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.531
Mom checked the odometer,

14:22.612 --> 14:24.531
remember?

14:24.572 --> 14:25.865
I'm on top of it.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.119
Whee! Hi, school!

14:30.161 --> 14:32.706
Oh, Malcolm, you

14:30.161 --> 14:32.706
should see this!

14:32.747 --> 14:34.123
Francis is

14:32.747 --> 14:34.123
kicking ass!

14:34.165 --> 14:36.000
(radio blasting)

14:34.165 --> 14:36.000
I hate this '80s crap.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.294
One good thing

14:36.042 --> 14:38.294
about a head injury:

14:38.336 --> 14:40.921
There's a good chance

14:38.336 --> 14:40.921
I won't remember any of this.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.757
Oh, great.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.757
A one-way street.

14:42.799 --> 14:45.301
How does that work if

14:42.799 --> 14:45.301
I'm going backwards?

14:45.343 --> 14:47.512
And on this joyous day,

14:47.554 --> 14:50.431
as we celebrate the occasion

14:47.554 --> 14:50.431
of two souls

14:50.473 --> 14:53.309
joining into one...

14:53.351 --> 14:55.186
Do you think this

14:53.351 --> 14:55.186
is going to be

14:55.228 --> 14:56.896
one of those long services?

14:58.981 --> 15:02.819
What's wrong?

15:02.861 --> 15:04.612
Did you know

15:02.861 --> 15:04.612
that your family

15:04.654 --> 15:06.155
has given me a nickname?

15:06.197 --> 15:07.240
Really?

15:07.281 --> 15:08.449
That's nice.

15:08.491 --> 15:09.826
What is it?

15:11.661 --> 15:15.874
Lois... Common... Denominator.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.837
Hey, come on.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.963
It's just that they've

15:20.879 --> 15:22.963
never seen anyone like you.

15:23.005 --> 15:26.551
I mean, you're, you're

15:23.005 --> 15:26.551
honest, and, uh...

15:26.593 --> 15:28.386
unpretentious.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.970
Direct.

15:30.012 --> 15:33.433
They're baffled by that.

15:33.474 --> 15:36.143
I'm the only one

15:33.474 --> 15:36.143
that gets you, Lois,

15:36.185 --> 15:37.978
and, frankly, I...

15:38.020 --> 15:40.565
I like that.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.860
Kind of makes you

15:40.607 --> 15:43.860
my secret treasure.

15:48.531 --> 15:51.117
Oh, Hal.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.996
...between the Lord and us,

15:53.035 --> 15:55.996
his servants,

15:56.038 --> 16:00.000
two people

15:56.038 --> 16:00.000
brought together in love...

16:00.042 --> 16:03.838
(moaning softly)

16:14.098 --> 16:16.016
Oh, for God's sake.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.602
You kids again?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.270
And a head injury.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.189
You boys like to keep it

16:19.312 --> 16:22.189
interesting, don't you?

16:22.231 --> 16:25.025
We kind of have a history here.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.653
♪ I was in the right place ♪

16:26.694 --> 16:29.029
♪ But it must have been

16:26.694 --> 16:29.029
the wrong time ♪

16:29.071 --> 16:31.198
♪ I was saying the right thing ♪

16:31.240 --> 16:33.827
♪ But I must have used

16:31.240 --> 16:33.827
the wrong line ♪

16:33.868 --> 16:35.870
♪ I was in the right world ♪

16:33.868 --> 16:35.870
(loud pop)

16:35.912 --> 16:39.457
♪ But it seem like it's wrong,

16:35.912 --> 16:39.457
wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. ♪

16:45.004 --> 16:47.298
Look, Doc, uh,

16:45.004 --> 16:47.298
about the bill...

16:47.340 --> 16:49.258
Oh, don't worry.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.258
We'll send it to your parents.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.885
Yeah, well...

16:50.927 --> 16:53.053
we were kind of thinking

16:50.927 --> 16:53.053
we'd pay for it now.

16:53.095 --> 16:56.056
Okeydokey, but it's probably

16:53.095 --> 16:56.056
going to be about $400.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.308
What?!

16:56.098 --> 16:57.308
$400?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.059
MALCOLM:

16:57.350 --> 16:59.059
Don't you have some kind

16:59.101 --> 17:01.354
of frequent customer discount

16:59.101 --> 17:01.354
like at the car wash?

17:01.395 --> 17:03.105
Or maybe we could work it off.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.441
We could empty bedpans,

17:03.147 --> 17:05.441
or wash cadavers.

17:05.483 --> 17:08.068
It's probably not nearly as cool

17:05.483 --> 17:08.068
as it sounds.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.029
Sorry.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.785
Well, we're screwed.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.912
Come on, there's

17:15.827 --> 17:17.912
got to be something

17:17.954 --> 17:20.289
we can do, someone

17:17.954 --> 17:20.289
we can call.

17:20.331 --> 17:21.708
There's no one, Malcolm.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.751
Actually, there might be,

17:23.793 --> 17:25.879
but I'm not sure

17:23.793 --> 17:25.879
if it's worth it.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.755
(gasping):

17:25.920 --> 17:27.755
Oh, Malcolm!

17:27.797 --> 17:29.089
Are you all right?

17:29.131 --> 17:30.925
Sorry it took

17:29.131 --> 17:30.925
me so long.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.593
I was having a little

17:30.967 --> 17:32.593
Chardonnay when you called,

17:32.635 --> 17:34.094
and I had to take a cab.

17:34.136 --> 17:36.263
Oh, God, I knew we made

17:34.136 --> 17:36.263
a deeper connection.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.807
I just  knew  it.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.684
Now, I know it's

17:37.849 --> 17:39.684
going to be hard

17:39.726 --> 17:41.978
to turn against your parents,

17:39.726 --> 17:41.978
but in time, you'll see...

17:42.020 --> 17:43.103
No! You don't understand.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.480
My parents didn't do this.

17:44.522 --> 17:45.773
It was just an accident,

17:45.815 --> 17:47.358
and they can't find out

17:45.815 --> 17:47.358
about it.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.359
What?

17:48.401 --> 17:50.403
It's kind of complicated.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.572
See, my parents are away

17:50.444 --> 17:52.572
at a wedding,

17:52.613 --> 17:54.114
and my brother is home

17:54.156 --> 17:55.783
from military school

17:54.156 --> 17:55.783
to take care of us.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.535
And, you know,

17:55.825 --> 17:57.535
I don't think people

17:57.577 --> 17:59.620
should be punished just 'cause

17:57.577 --> 17:59.620
their dad uses cheap nails.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.748
And we need...

17:59.662 --> 18:01.748
We need $400, lady.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.291
Will you let me talk?!

18:04.333 --> 18:06.126
We need the money

18:04.333 --> 18:06.126
for the doctor bill

18:06.168 --> 18:08.170
because if my parents find out

18:06.168 --> 18:08.170
that I got hurt,

18:08.212 --> 18:10.172
then they'll send Francis away,

18:08.212 --> 18:10.172
and we'll never

18:10.214 --> 18:14.468
see him again, and, you know,

18:10.214 --> 18:14.468
we love him.

18:15.636 --> 18:18.180
Malcolm, I can't do that.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.975
But you said,

18:18.222 --> 18:20.975
if I ever needed anything...

18:21.017 --> 18:23.644
Yes, I was talking

18:21.017 --> 18:23.644
about emotional stuff.

18:23.686 --> 18:28.066
I... Do you have any idea

18:23.686 --> 18:28.066
what a teacher earns?

18:28.107 --> 18:31.027
I have $62 in my

18:28.107 --> 18:31.027
checking account.

18:31.069 --> 18:32.194
They take credit cards.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.530
I'm sorry.

18:34.572 --> 18:38.409
I'm... I'm-I'm just sorry.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.832
We can break her.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.832
Guilt. Go for guilt.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.166
I got it.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.376
That's okay.

18:47.418 --> 18:50.046
Thanks, anyway.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.007
Well, squirt,

18:51.213 --> 18:53.007
looks like I'm

18:53.049 --> 18:55.009
going to be going

18:53.049 --> 18:55.009
back to military school

18:55.051 --> 18:57.053
and I'm not going

18:55.051 --> 18:57.053
to see you for a really,

18:57.095 --> 18:58.596
really long time.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.181
But I need you to be brave.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.558
Can you do that for me,

19:01.223 --> 19:02.558
huh, squirt?

19:02.600 --> 19:04.769
Stop, Francis!

19:04.811 --> 19:06.186
I wish I

19:04.811 --> 19:06.186
could, kiddo,

19:06.228 --> 19:07.814
but I can't.

19:07.855 --> 19:11.191
(Dewey crying)

19:11.233 --> 19:12.860
Why are you doing this?

19:12.902 --> 19:14.278
I'm not doing this, Dewey.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.614
It's just the way life is

19:14.320 --> 19:16.614
sometimes.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.198
(Dewey crying)

19:18.240 --> 19:20.200
Please stop crying.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.078
It hurts!

19:20.242 --> 19:22.078
I know it does.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.412
It hurts me, too.

19:23.454 --> 19:26.206
Wait! I'll, I'll do it.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.751
I guess Jamaica

19:26.248 --> 19:28.751
isn't going anywhere.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.420
Where is my credit card?

19:31.462 --> 19:33.131
It fell out

19:31.462 --> 19:33.131
of your wallet.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.381
How did that happen? It...

19:34.423 --> 19:35.675
Let's go.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.217
Processing is

19:35.716 --> 19:37.217
right over there.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.594
It's right near the

19:37.259 --> 19:38.594
vending machines.

19:38.636 --> 19:39.804
Do you have any change?

19:39.846 --> 19:41.221
Thank you.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.223
Way to take one

19:41.263 --> 19:43.223
for the team, buddy.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.308
When we get home,

19:44.350 --> 19:46.393
you can eat ice cream

19:44.350 --> 19:46.393
until you puke.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.814
(still sobbing):

19:46.435 --> 19:49.814
Yay.

19:49.856 --> 19:53.943
(whooping and laughing)

19:59.657 --> 20:03.995
(groaning and exclaiming)

20:08.290 --> 20:10.751
Huh. Well...

20:10.793 --> 20:12.252
I don't see any holes

20:12.294 --> 20:14.755
or crappy attempts

20:12.294 --> 20:14.755
to plaster them up.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.465
But I'm sure there's something.

20:16.507 --> 20:19.093
There's always something.

20:20.803 --> 20:23.097
What are you hiding

20:20.803 --> 20:23.097
underneath that hat?

20:23.139 --> 20:24.724
Nothing. I was just wearing...

20:29.520 --> 20:33.149
You boys.

20:33.191 --> 20:35.359
That's  it?!

20:35.401 --> 20:37.277
So, you guys think

20:35.401 --> 20:37.277
Francis did a good job

20:37.319 --> 20:38.362
taking care of us, then?

20:38.404 --> 20:39.530
Oh, a great job.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.948
Yeah?

20:39.572 --> 20:40.948
LOIS:

20:39.572 --> 20:40.948
Absolutely.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.449
You know, Francis,

20:40.990 --> 20:42.449
we were having our doubts

20:42.491 --> 20:45.285
about that school, but

20:42.491 --> 20:45.285
it's really matured you.

20:45.327 --> 20:48.288
In fact, I think it's the

20:45.327 --> 20:48.288
best decision we ever made.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.331
(chuckling)

20:51.209 --> 20:54.294
Mom: 62,437.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.255
Kids: zero.

20:59.133 --> 21:01.928
So, we get to see Francis again

20:59.133 --> 21:01.928
in a month or two.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.471
I know. It sucks,

21:01.969 --> 21:04.471
but we gave it a shot.

21:04.513 --> 21:07.183
And school's easier now

21:04.513 --> 21:07.183
because Caroline won't even

21:07.225 --> 21:09.102
make eye contact

21:07.225 --> 21:09.102
with me anymore,

21:09.143 --> 21:11.938
so it wasn't a complete waste,

21:09.143 --> 21:11.938
and Mom always says

21:11.979 --> 21:15.315
it's not a wasted experience

21:11.979 --> 21:15.315
if you learn something from it,

21:15.357 --> 21:17.151
and I definitely think I did.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.987
Okay! Ready!
