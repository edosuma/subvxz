get the blue rag, tie it on
the gate for the patrol.

going to make it.

that do you, ma'am?

16:53.440 --> 16:55.032

his revolver.

if I knew I could use it.

what I can spare.

34:40.480 --> 34:41.480
Bless us,

34:41.719 --> 34:43.039
and bless thee thy gifts,

34:43.239 --> 34:44.960

34:49.520 --> 34:50.520
ALL: Amen.

34:52.560 --> 34:55.120
It has occurred to me
that we might reflect

34:55.320 --> 34:56.639
on the unexpected presence

34:56.760 --> 34:58.800
of Corporal McBurney in our house...
(DISH CLATTERS)

35:01.400 --> 35:03.311
...until his leg heals,
of course.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.876
And we might discuss how
we may practice compassion

35:08.080 --> 35:10.120
and what else we might learn
from his presence here.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.200
What does each of you
think of this?

35:16.080 --> 35:18.150
Miss Alicia,
can you tell us

35:18.240 --> 35:20.360
what do you think we may learn
from his presence here?

35:21.120 --> 35:23.350
Well, maybe the sight
of him will remind us

35:23.520 --> 35:26.398
there's something else in
the world besides lessons.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.496
Well, it seems to me
that is all there should be

35:28.520 --> 35:29.953
for any young lady your age.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.196
If we learn our lessons
properly when young,

35:33.400 --> 35:36.551
we can expect
a calm and happy life

35:36.920 --> 35:39.115
when faced with the
distractions of the world.

35:40.240 --> 35:41.275
N'est-ce pas?

35:41.840 --> 35:44.274
With the presence
of this hateful enemy,

35:44.480 --> 35:46.152
it'll be a constant
reminder to us

35:46.240 --> 35:47.878
that the war
is still going on,

35:48.600 --> 35:51.034
and the sacrifices
and prayers we must make.

35:51.240 --> 35:53.356
Mmm.
EDWINA: May I say,

35:53.440 --> 35:55.670
that any breath of fresh air
from the outside world,

35:55.880 --> 35:58.189
I think is welcome
to us all.

35:58.360 --> 35:59.600
EMILY: I heard
he's a mercenary,

35:59.800 --> 36:01.518
so maybe he's not
even really an enemy.

36:01.720 --> 36:02.720
What's a mercenary?

36:03.000 --> 36:05.036
It means he's just paid
by the army to fight,

36:05.200 --> 36:06.640
he's not really
fighting their cause.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.950
Well, we don't know
about that.

36:09.160 --> 36:10.878
AMY: He seems to be
a student of nature,

36:10.960 --> 36:13.315
so I expect to learn
about foreign wildlife.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.677
He seems to be
a sensitive person.

36:17.920 --> 36:18.955
Does he?

36:20.640 --> 36:23.234
I found him understanding.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.149
Do you, indeed?

36:25.320 --> 36:28.790
Oh, you must share more of
your findings with us, Edwina.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.713
As dedicated Christians,

36:32.880 --> 36:36.077
we will join the Corporal
after dinner for a prayer.

36:36.240 --> 36:37.275
Before we retire.

36:37.440 --> 36:38.953
ALL: Yes, Miss Martha.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.110
Shall we? (INHALES DEEPLY)

36:48.600 --> 36:49.600

36:50.680 --> 36:52.875
Would you care to join us
for an evening prayer?

36:52.960 --> 36:53.960
Yes, ma'am.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.236
But first, maybe
we'll have a little music

36:56.320 --> 36:57.878
if that's not
too disturbing for you.

36:57.960 --> 37:00.440
Oh, no disturbance at all. No.
I'd love to hear a bit of music.

37:00.800 --> 37:01.800

37:02.280 --> 37:03.599
Yes, ma'am.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.519

you play beautifully.

37:20.480 --> 37:21.480
Doesn't she?

37:21.920 --> 37:22.920
Indeed.

slowly by, Lorena

The sun's low
down the sky, Lorena

37:52.320 --> 37:56.472
The frost gleams
where the flowers have been

37:57.760 --> 38:02.151
But the heart throbs on
as warmly now

38:03.760 --> 38:09.073
As when the summer days
were nigh

It could be some of our own.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.194
Edwina, wait here
with the girls.

38:31.400 --> 38:34.312
If it is enemy soldiers,
I'll rap on the door three times.

38:34.480 --> 38:35.856
We'll go to the woods
and meet you there.

38:35.880 --> 38:36.880
What about the Corporal?

38:37.040 --> 38:39.280
Well, he's in no condition to leave.
He will remain here.

39:18.840 --> 39:20.034
Right this way.

39:23.280 --> 39:25.635

Why are they here?

39:30.920 --> 39:32.911
Do you think they're here
for the Corporal?

39:33.720 --> 39:34.869
They may be.

39:36.080 --> 39:37.176
JANE: Why don't
we turn him in?

39:37.200 --> 39:38.872
Are they coming?
I'm so scared.

39:44.200 --> 39:45.599

39:45.680 --> 39:46.680
It's all right.

39:47.680 --> 39:48.976
There's two of them.
Two of our own.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.216
I've given them something to eat.
They're in the kitchen.

39:51.240 --> 39:52.240
Why did they come?

39:52.320 --> 39:53.833
To offer their assistance.

39:53.920 --> 39:56.309
The army is about to leave
the vicinity.

39:56.680 --> 39:59.035
As of yet, I haven't
told them about the Corporal.

40:00.520 --> 40:03.671
But I might ask them
to take him with them.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.435
But he couldn't ride
without hurting his leg.

40:06.600 --> 40:07.976
Well, I could tell them
that he's wounded.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.991
Suggest that they come back.

40:10.600 --> 40:13.353
But that could be weeks.
Could even be months.

40:13.560 --> 40:15.755
They'll probably insist
on taking him right now,

40:16.160 --> 40:17.878
and who knows
what'll happen to him.

40:18.440 --> 40:20.960
MARIE: They could shoot him and
leave him along the road to die.

40:21.360 --> 40:23.715
I could allow the Corporal to
stay until he is recovered,

40:24.120 --> 40:26.031
and then we could send him
on his way, alone.

40:26.240 --> 40:27.355
Oh, yes.

40:27.520 --> 40:29.760
MISS MARTHA: There is Christian
charity to be considered.

40:29.920 --> 40:32.957
You keep talking about him as if
he wasn't right here in this room.

40:33.360 --> 40:35.656
EMILY: And there are the doubts if
we can really consider him an enemy.

40:35.680 --> 40:36.908
AMY: Please, Miss Martha.

40:40.320 --> 40:44.313
I will allow Corporal McBurney to
stay here until his leg has healed.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.656
But if any of you
is opposed to it,

40:46.680 --> 40:49.069
I will tell the soldiers right now,
and they will decide

40:49.160 --> 40:50.388
what his fate will be.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.280
Any of you?

40:52.920 --> 40:54.319
Miss Jane?

40:56.760 --> 40:57.829
Well then,

he will stay.

temptation in their way.

I have to say,

41:25.600 --> 41:27.238
when they saw me,

41:27.640 --> 41:29.676
they said, there is
nothing more frightening

than a startled woman
with a gun.

very much, ma'am.

warming up to him,

42:02.640 --> 42:04.119
and I believe
he likes it here.

42:04.280 --> 42:05.759
What would you know?

42:06.560 --> 42:08.278
I've talked
with him privately.

42:09.960 --> 42:11.096
You think just
because you found him,

42:11.120 --> 42:12.816
you have some sort of special
relationship with him?

42:12.840 --> 42:14.273
You're just jealous.
Shh.

42:21.280 --> 42:22.998
It must be tiring
for you.

42:25.320 --> 42:27.959
I can't say
it hasn't been a struggle.

42:28.800 --> 42:29.920
Well, I admire
your strength.

42:31.120 --> 42:34.000
I know it must be hard for you to be
strong all the time for these girls.

42:34.960 --> 42:36.416
They're lucky to have
a woman such as yourself

42:36.440 --> 42:37.576
to keep going
for all of them.

42:37.600 --> 42:41.115
I'm just trying to give them what
they need to survive in these times.

42:41.360 --> 42:43.800
It's a very different world out
there that they're going into,

42:43.920 --> 42:45.638
I don't think
they realize it.

42:45.840 --> 42:47.956

it's like out there.

the end is near.

I can't make any sense of it,
how much everyone has suffered.

There's no sense
to be made of it.

43:00.680 --> 43:01.680
Hmm.

Did you have someone
before the war?

I did.

Well, I'm sorry.

43:22.040 --> 43:23.678
Everyone has lost so much.

43:23.840 --> 43:25.512

really is until you've seen it.

44:44.640 --> 44:45.640
Be careful.

44:45.760 --> 44:47.360
Don't put too much weight
on the bad leg.

44:47.560 --> 44:48.709
Yes, ma'am.

44:50.240 --> 44:52.120
I still wouldn't rush
nature to take its course,

44:52.280 --> 44:53.720
but if you want
to risk doing this...

44:53.840 --> 44:55.796
Oh! Corporal, please.

44:56.160 --> 44:57.593
Steady yourself.

44:57.760 --> 44:58.936
Can you help me outside,
Miss Amy?

44:58.960 --> 45:00.439
Yes, of course.

45:07.800 --> 45:08.835
Good day, Corporal.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
McBURNEY: Ladies.

45:10.400 --> 45:11.736
It's your turn
in the kitchen garden.

45:11.760 --> 45:12.760
That's right.

45:12.800 --> 45:14.836
I'm helping the Corporal,
as you can see.

45:15.280 --> 45:16.633
I'm sure
we could relieve you.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
No, that's enough.

45:18.240 --> 45:20.071
I'll decide
whose work is needed.

45:20.320 --> 45:21.320
On your way, girls.

45:21.800 --> 45:23.950
Yes, ma'am. (SIGHS)

45:27.800 --> 45:29.950
This reminds me of the first
time we met, you and me.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.272
Your roses need pruning.

45:39.880 --> 45:41.677
And those hedges
are in terrible shape.

45:43.320 --> 45:44.496
Your whole flower garden
needs tending.

45:44.520 --> 45:46.351
I'll get to it tomorrow.

45:48.480 --> 45:51.278
Have you had much gardening
experience, Corporal McBurney?

45:51.440 --> 45:52.793
I've done
a bit of it, yeah.

45:53.960 --> 45:56.474
Well, if you really have
such a gift for gardening,

45:57.200 --> 45:59.668
you may assist us
later in your convalescence.

46:00.040 --> 46:01.712
It would be my pleasure,
ma'am.

46:04.800 --> 46:07.189

47:42.560 --> 47:44.437
I like very much.
Thank you, my girl.

47:45.800 --> 47:47.791
Miss Martha told me
to return to my lessons,

47:47.960 --> 47:50.155
but I told her all the
things you need me to do.

47:50.480 --> 47:51.816
Yeah, sure. I'm counting
on you to keep

47:51.840 --> 47:53.320
me clumsy feet away
from birds' nests.

47:54.160 --> 47:56.116
That, and keep me company.

any of the others,

friend in this whole place.

48:02.960 --> 48:04.757
You do?
Yeah, of course I do.

48:04.960 --> 48:07.456
I'm sure if it wasn't for you,
I'd still be sitting under that tree.

things about us to the Corporal.

49:55.720 --> 49:57.870
I was wondering
how your leg is?

49:58.920 --> 50:00.956
It, uh, twinges
a bit now and then.

50:01.400 --> 50:02.913
I would expect that.

50:03.360 --> 50:04.509
You will recall
I was the one

50:04.600 --> 50:06.556
who was opposed to you
walking on it so soon.

50:06.720 --> 50:07.720
Yes, ma'am.

50:07.760 --> 50:12.197
However, I appreciate
your desire to be active.

50:13.800 --> 50:15.836
May I check?
Yes, ma'am.

50:27.160 --> 50:28.160
Well...

50:32.840 --> 50:35.991
The stitches, uh,
they're holding nicely.

50:36.400 --> 50:37.469
Mmm.

50:37.560 --> 50:39.437
The wound
is healing very well.

50:40.280 --> 50:42.430
When do you think
I'll be fully recovered?

50:43.920 --> 50:45.911
Some would say
you're recovered now.

50:46.840 --> 50:48.353
I'm sure the army surgeons
would say

50:48.480 --> 50:50.277
you are ready
to return to duty.

50:51.640 --> 50:52.789
So, you'd like me
to leave?

50:53.360 --> 50:54.360
I didn't say that.

50:54.480 --> 50:55.480
No, of course not.

50:55.600 --> 50:57.909
You're far too polite a lady
to be so blunt about it.

50:58.080 --> 51:00.310
I am as blunt as I need
to be, Corporal McBurney.

51:01.800 --> 51:02.800
Since you brought it up,

51:02.920 --> 51:04.336
I would say that the leg
will be healed well enough

51:04.360 --> 51:06.112
to leave by the end
of the week.

51:07.320 --> 51:08.799

I'm afraid that is entirely your
business where you go, Corporal.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.117
However, I think you may
find columns of your troops

51:21.240 --> 51:22.832

to Richmond.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.150
Your garden should have
continual care.

a full-time gardener.

51:32.200 --> 51:33.394

one just has to do without.

couldn't have remained helpless.

make it so pleasant for him

that he won't even
consider leaving us.

to Miss Martha

that the Corporal join us

we change the subject
