WEBVTT

00:09.634 --> 00:11.594
- Jeremy, party of five!
- That's us!

00:12.637 --> 00:15.473
Ooh, oh.
Ah! Excuse me.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.393
Whew.

00:18.476 --> 00:19.853
Remember when we
had to legally

00:19.936 --> 00:21.771
stand six feet apart
from one another?

00:21.855 --> 00:23.356
Yeah,
I miss it.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.816
- Excuse us.
- Oh, excuse us.

00:25.316 --> 00:26.651
Sorry.

00:26.735 --> 00:27.569
Carrie?

00:27.652 --> 00:29.696
Is that
Bitsy von Muffling?

00:29.779 --> 00:32.407
- Carrie. Excuse me.
- Yep, that's Bitsy.

00:32.490 --> 00:34.659
I can't believe it.
I cannot believe it.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.120
Oh, it's been forever.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.997
Do we hug
or bump elbows?

00:39.080 --> 00:40.915
Sign language,
smoke signals.

00:40.999 --> 00:41.750
Where are we these days?

00:41.833 --> 00:45.253
And, and where's
the fourth musketeer?

00:45.336 --> 00:46.504
Where's Samantha?

00:46.588 --> 00:49.340
Oh, um, she's
no longer with us.

00:50.508 --> 00:51.384
No, no, no, no.
She didn't die.

00:51.468 --> 00:54.262
Oh no! No, no.
I'm so sorry, no.

00:54.345 --> 00:55.847
I just meant
she's not with us.

00:55.930 --> 00:59.768
- She's in London.
- Oh, thank god.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.770
After the horror show
we've been through,

01:01.853 --> 01:03.438
I just assume
anyone I haven't seen

01:03.521 --> 01:04.272
in a while
has passed on,

01:04.355 --> 01:06.107
or... gave up
and moved to Palm Beach.

01:06.191 --> 01:10.320
- No, she moved
to the U.K. for work.
- Smart.

01:10.403 --> 01:14.115
Sexy sirens in their 60s
are still viable over there.

01:14.199 --> 01:17.869
- Well, enjoy.
Bitsy, are you coming?

01:19.204 --> 01:21.581
Bye!

01:21.664 --> 01:24.292
Remember when we
couldn't air kiss
hello or goodbye?

01:24.375 --> 01:26.002
Yes, I miss it.

01:26.085 --> 01:27.003
Carrie, party of three!

01:27.086 --> 01:30.882
- Yay! Yes, that's us. Yay.
- Nice! Here we go.

01:37.263 --> 01:40.683
I stepped on a used condom
in Brady's room this morning.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.185
- Eww--
- Wait!

01:42.268 --> 01:44.145
I was barefoot at the time.
Okay now.

01:44.229 --> 01:48.274
- Eww.
- Ooh, does anyone wanna
split the croque madame?

01:48.358 --> 01:50.610
I will.
Did you hear
what I said?

01:50.693 --> 01:52.821
Mm-hm.
Are we getting
fries with that?

01:52.904 --> 01:55.240
I stepped on my son's
semen before coffee.

01:55.323 --> 01:56.115
We are definitely
getting fries with that.

01:56.199 --> 01:59.786
- Hmm.
- This is totally
on Steve and me.

01:59.869 --> 02:02.163
We started letting
Luisa spend the night
because we like her,

02:02.247 --> 02:05.041
and now Brady's bedroom
floor is a minefield.

02:05.124 --> 02:07.252
Well, it's good
he's using protection.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.838
Now that is seeing
the condom as half full.

02:09.921 --> 02:10.922
When do you start school?

02:12.924 --> 02:14.926
What?
I changed the subject.
Life's too short.

02:15.009 --> 02:17.929
I'm starting with
spring semester next week.

02:18.012 --> 02:20.849
- Wow.
- Oh, really? Next week?

02:20.932 --> 02:23.268
Are you gonna,
you know--

02:23.351 --> 02:26.104
Go crazy?
Too late, already happened.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.272
No, color your hair.

02:27.355 --> 02:32.026
Now where is that darn
waitperson with the check?

02:32.110 --> 02:33.987
- We haven't even ordered yet.
- Oh, I know, but I want out now.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.905
I just think
the gray ages you.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.700
No, you think
the gray ages you

02:38.783 --> 02:40.201
because if we're friends,
and I am this age,

02:40.285 --> 02:43.037
you can't be whatever age
you're pretending to be.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.206
I am not pretending
to be any age.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.458
- I am 55.
- What? You want a medal?

02:47.542 --> 02:50.044
Yes. Yes, I do.
Can I get a medal?

02:50.128 --> 02:53.339
Yes, you can,
and when I turn
55 in 10 years,

02:53.423 --> 02:55.258
I would like
a medal as well.

02:55.341 --> 02:59.304
- Thank you.
- And... why are you
just going after me?

02:59.387 --> 03:00.805
Carrie dyes
her hair, too.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.224
Yeah, but hers is obvious.
You're trying to pass.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.018
Yeah, but obvious
in a good way, right?

03:05.101 --> 03:07.020
'Cause this kind of "obvious,"
it don't come cheap.

03:07.103 --> 03:09.063
You look great gray,
but I miss the red.

03:09.147 --> 03:12.233
And I just thought
it might be fun,

03:12.317 --> 03:13.693
you know, for
the start of school.

03:13.776 --> 03:15.862
Yeah, for all your
playdates and things.

03:15.945 --> 03:18.781
Charlotte, I'm getting
a Master's in Human Rights

03:18.865 --> 03:20.700
to pair with my law degree,

03:20.783 --> 03:24.412
so, hopefully,
I can become an advocate
for women who need one.

03:24.495 --> 03:28.374
I don't have to be
a spicy redhead to do that.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.377
I mean, we can't
just stay who we were.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.128
- Right?
- Absolutely.

03:32.211 --> 03:34.464
And there are more
important issues

03:34.547 --> 03:36.299
in the world than
trying to look young.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.679
Ruth Bader Ginsburg
dyed her hair.

03:41.763 --> 03:42.931
Mic drop.

03:44.724 --> 03:48.227
Wow, I've gotta get him.

03:48.311 --> 03:51.314
Do you see his hat?
Looks like a light fixture.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.443
- For my Instagram.

03:55.526 --> 03:56.402
How's all that goin'?

03:56.486 --> 03:58.655
Uh, you know,
when I first
started doing it,

03:58.738 --> 04:00.865
it was really just for me,
you know, just for fun,

04:00.949 --> 04:03.785
posting strangers who
have interesting style,

04:03.868 --> 04:06.537
but now... that
I'm on that podcast,

04:06.621 --> 04:07.956
it's kind of
growing into a thing.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.123
Wow. Instagram, podcast.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.793
I guess you're passing
as younger, too.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.795
Still haven't listened
to it, have you?

04:13.878 --> 04:16.297
Carrie,
I love you to death,

04:16.381 --> 04:17.966
but I draw the line
at podcasts.

04:18.049 --> 04:22.595
I just ran into LTW
in the ladies' room.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.764
Great! I don't know
what that means.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.849
Lisa Todd Wexley.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.977
Everyone at school
calls her LTW.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.188
Now, is LTW a person,

04:32.271 --> 04:34.816
- or a sorority you
hope to pledge.
- I know, I know.

04:34.899 --> 04:37.777
I sound so silly,
but she's just so cool.

04:37.860 --> 04:41.447
She is a documentarian,
and a humanitarian.

04:41.531 --> 04:45.284
And her husband, Herbert,
is an investment banker
who might run for mayor.

04:45.368 --> 04:48.663
And she's on
the International "Vogue"
Best-Dressed List.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.373
Wow, I think I need a nap.

04:50.456 --> 04:51.582
We are on the parent
school board together,

04:51.666 --> 04:54.669
so, this year, we've
been getting to know
each other better

04:54.752 --> 04:56.546
'cause she signed
her son, Henry, up

04:56.629 --> 05:00.383
to study with the same
piano teacher that
Lily studies with.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.010
- Oh, which reminds me--
- To breathe?

05:02.093 --> 05:04.929
You haven't RSVP'd yet
for Lily's piano recital.

05:05.013 --> 05:08.016
Oh, I know.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I can't go.

05:08.099 --> 05:08.933
Big and I are driving
out east on Wednesday.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.060
Can't you drive out Friday?

05:11.144 --> 05:12.854
'Cause Lily has
been practicing

05:12.937 --> 05:14.522
for this night
every day for a year.

05:14.605 --> 05:17.817
Sweetie, I know,
but Big already
took time off.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.403
But you could
go to the Hamptons
with Big any time.

05:20.486 --> 05:23.948
And this concert
is at the Manhattan
School of Music.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.659
It's a very big deal.

05:26.743 --> 05:27.910
The Manhattan School
of Music, Carrie.

05:27.994 --> 05:31.289
The Manhattan
School of Music.

05:31.372 --> 05:32.290
I'm sorry, where is
the concert again?

05:34.292 --> 05:36.502
All right, I'll talk
to him. I will.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.421
- Oh, hi!
- I don't wanna interrupt.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.173
- Oh, you're not interrupting!
- Hi.

05:40.256 --> 05:42.967
These are my
very best friends,
Miranda and Carrie.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.218
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Lisa.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.386
Charlotte has told me
so much about you both.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.347
Well, we just got
the crash course
on you, too.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.474
- Oh no.

05:49.557 --> 05:53.061
- That's a great bracelet.
- It's interesting, right?

05:53.144 --> 05:55.063
It's this 20-year-old out
of Jackson, Mississippi,
I came across online.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.314
- She's amazing.
- Oh, that's great.

05:56.397 --> 05:59.067
Oh my god.
Who ordered
the French fries?

05:59.150 --> 06:02.236
I'd have to know you
a lot longer before
I confessed that.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.571
- Can I have one?
- Sure, they're cold.

06:03.654 --> 06:06.407
- But they're still
greasy, right?

06:06.491 --> 06:07.992
- So bad, they're good.
- Ooh, yikes, I'm gonna be late.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.787
I have to go
do a podcast.

06:10.870 --> 06:14.207
- They're like jury duty now.
- Yeah, I should go, too.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.958
Um, it was
really, really
nice to meet you.

06:16.042 --> 06:20.254
- Any friend of French fries
is a friend of mine.
- Hope to see you again.

06:20.338 --> 06:22.298
- Yeah, same here.

06:22.381 --> 06:24.550
- Sit!
- What did you get at Oscar?

06:24.634 --> 06:26.636
- Show me.
- Oh, it's for the girls.

06:27.470 --> 06:30.389
- Ta-da!
It's gorg.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.016
I just wanted them to have
something so special

06:32.100 --> 06:34.477
for Lily's big night.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.311
Henry is gonna
bomb this recital.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.771
- Oh, no, he won't.
- It's my fault.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.773
I started him too late.

06:38.856 --> 06:39.607
I have to force
him to practice.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.734
I literally have
to pry his fingers

06:41.818 --> 06:44.278
off the PlayStation,
and put them on the keyboard.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.155
Well, you know what?
He's a beginner.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.117
- People will understand.
- People might, but my
mother-in-law won't.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.119
She's a world-renowned
concert pianist,

06:51.202 --> 06:53.955
and an even moreaccomplished pain in my ass.

06:54.038 --> 06:56.165
Oh, my friends are waiting.
I'll call you later.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.792
- Bye.
- Bye! I'll talk to you soon.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.460
Yes! Bye.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.129
Don't stress if you
can't make the recital.

07:01.212 --> 07:04.799
Her piano teacher
rents that venue.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.634
It's the Park Avenue
equivalent of

07:06.717 --> 07:07.510
"every kid
gets a trophy."

07:08.970 --> 07:11.347
Still, I should go.

07:11.430 --> 07:14.725
Charlotte's
an amazingly
supportive friend.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.603
- She listens to the podcast.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.025
You know,
it is kinda like
she's dead...

07:23.109 --> 07:24.110
Samantha.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.736
We never even
talk about her.

07:27.864 --> 07:28.531
Well, what is
there to say?

07:31.242 --> 07:32.827
I told her that
because of, you know,

07:32.910 --> 07:33.661
what the book
business is now,

07:33.744 --> 07:36.539
it just didn't make
sense for me to...

07:36.622 --> 07:38.541
keep her on
as a publicist.
She said, "Fine,"

07:38.624 --> 07:41.919
- and then fired me as a friend.
- She didn't fire you.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.796
Okay, she stopped
returning my calls.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.506
You know Samantha.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.592
- Her pride got damaged.
- Which was why I kept

07:47.675 --> 07:51.179
leaving her voicemails,
asking her to please
call me back,

07:51.262 --> 07:52.471
so we could talk
about this and fix it.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.768
Look, I understand
that she was upset,

07:57.852 --> 07:59.896
but I thought
I was more to her
than an ATM.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.231
You are.

08:02.315 --> 08:06.569
- She was embarrassed.
- So embarrassed she took a job
and moved to London?

08:06.652 --> 08:08.029
Wait, have you
spoken to her?

08:08.112 --> 08:11.908
No, neither
has Charlotte.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.619
I mean,
we texted and called,
but we never heard back.

08:16.495 --> 08:20.208
- Do you think, maybe, if you--
- I did. Multiple texts.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.376
- And nothing.
- Okay.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.963
Well, then I guess
that's all we can,
you know, do.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.382
- So weird.
- I know.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.469
I always thought
the four of us would
be friends forever.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.849
- Anyway, up I go.
- Okay.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.601
- Okay, thanks for walking me.
- Sure.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.731
Hey, Carrie...
My hair?

08:43.814 --> 08:45.233
Fabulous.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.829
Hi, everyone.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.793
That's it? That's all
the greeting I get
after I rescued you?

09:03.876 --> 09:07.797
Are you talking to me or Burton?
'Cause you rescued me, too.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.258
Lily, that is
a terrible thing to say.

09:10.341 --> 09:13.094
I know.
That's why I said it.

09:13.177 --> 09:14.929
Well, never say it again,

09:15.012 --> 09:17.431
and, for the record,
you rescued me.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.475
Mwah!

09:19.558 --> 09:21.477
- Please love me.
- Mom, don't be so needy.

09:21.560 --> 09:26.023
I am not being needy.
He's withholding.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.650
- Do you wanna see your dress?
- Mm-hm.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.736
Do you wanna see
the dress, Richard Burton?

09:30.820 --> 09:31.570
Do you wanna
see the dress, hm?

09:34.657 --> 09:36.701
Da-da-da-da!

09:36.784 --> 09:38.619
- So pretty!
- I love it.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.579
And what's in
the other bag?

09:40.663 --> 09:42.248
A dress for Rose,
of course.

09:46.377 --> 09:49.088
- We are here!
- Hit it, kiddo. Hit it hard.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.717
Ooh, nicely done.

09:53.676 --> 09:57.138
Okay, go for it, Dad.

09:57.221 --> 10:00.683
Harry, you better
not have your hands
on those walls again!

10:00.766 --> 10:01.559
I don't!

10:03.311 --> 10:04.770
Much...

10:04.854 --> 10:06.147
Just once or twice.

10:06.230 --> 10:09.150
- I'm gettin' really good, babe.
- You are ridiculous.

10:09.233 --> 10:12.028
- But it keeps you guessin'.
- Yes.

10:12.111 --> 10:15.114
Rose, honey, let me show
you the dress I got you
for Lily's concert.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.032
I am gettin' there.

10:16.115 --> 10:19.285
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.

10:19.368 --> 10:21.037
- Isn't it pretty?
- Ooh.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.705
Okay... define pretty.

10:28.002 --> 10:31.047
- Uh, Dad?
What?

10:31.130 --> 10:33.883
Bike helmet not
a good look on
a 58-year-old Jew?

10:43.100 --> 10:46.437
- Oh, honey, I'm home!
- Hey, kid.

10:47.229 --> 10:47.521
Let the wine begin.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.447
Mmm.

10:58.616 --> 11:01.035
Is that supposed
to make me forget that
you're a half-hour late?

11:01.118 --> 11:02.411
- Did it?
- Oh yeah.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.373
Then my work
here is done.

11:08.292 --> 11:09.460
How was your day?

11:09.543 --> 11:13.506
Perfect.
The Dow and the Mets both up.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.424
Very nice.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.719
Hey... that shady fish guy

11:18.803 --> 11:20.471
tried to slip me some
low-rent salmon again.

11:20.554 --> 11:23.140
I said, "At these prices?"
Oh, no, sir.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.518
No, no, no, no, no.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.978
That is not
the Copper River
sockeye salmon.

11:31.732 --> 11:34.568
- What?
- I'm just wondering who
this person is I'm looking at

11:34.652 --> 11:36.570
because I remember
when you kept

11:36.654 --> 11:37.405
your sweaters
in the stove.

11:37.488 --> 11:40.241
I remember when
your hair was black.

11:40.324 --> 11:41.659
Oh, that's really
uncalled for.

11:41.742 --> 11:45.788
- Totally uncalled for.
- You wanna go there, huh?

11:47.164 --> 11:48.457
'Cause I can go there.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.584
Well why don't you
stop going there,

11:50.668 --> 11:53.254
and go there, and put on
the album <i>du jour.</i>

11:53.337 --> 11:54.130
Okay, Mr. Big.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.715
What letter we up to?

11:56.799 --> 11:58.592
"R," last night
was Ronstadt.

11:58.676 --> 12:02.430
That's right.
Yep, Ronstadt.
Here we are.

12:02.513 --> 12:05.433
So, tonight is
Todd Rundgren.

12:05.516 --> 12:08.519
- Oh, that's my favorite
fucking album.
- Fucking album.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.146
You know, you've
said that about

12:10.229 --> 12:12.064
pretty much every
album since we started

12:12.148 --> 12:13.441
this little dinner
ritual waaay back

12:13.524 --> 12:16.068
on day three
of the lockdown.

12:16.152 --> 12:19.155
- What's your point?
- My point is...

12:19.238 --> 12:22.199
- You got a lot of favorites.
Yes, I do.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.413
But this guy--

12:28.539 --> 12:34.587

Thank you.
Do you wanna
come with me?

13:24.678 --> 13:26.514
Didn't think so.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.182
Well, what are you
gonna do that night?

13:28.265 --> 13:30.267
Oh, don't worry about me.

Oh, her again?

That's enough salt.

Yeah, I'm jealous.

13:43.447 --> 13:46.242
I'm jealous of your
Peloton instructor.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.160
Well, you should be.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.204
You know she's
from Barcelona?

13:50.287 --> 13:52.289
- She motivates me.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.833
And she's giving me
a special shout-out

13:54.917 --> 13:56.168

Hi.

15:07.823 --> 15:08.532
Could I get a glass
of Chablis, please?

15:08.616 --> 15:10.868
Oh, we don't
open 'til 11.

15:12.661 --> 15:15.039
- It's 11:00 somewhere.
- Sorry, ma'am.

15:17.499 --> 15:20.669
Okay, I'll wait.

15:49.031 --> 15:53.327
- Hey, that's where
the professor sits.
- Oh, sorry.

15:55.537 --> 15:56.747
Thanks.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.124
Thank you.

16:04.254 --> 16:05.339
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

16:06.173 --> 16:07.883
That's where
the professor sits.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.219
Uh, sorry,
he just told me.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.680
- Someone's quick
with the pronouns.
- Uh, it's fine.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.848
I am the professor.

16:14.932 --> 16:18.477
- Wa-- Y-You're the professor?
- Yeah.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.688
- You're Nya Wallace?
Yes.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.356
Why do you seem
so surprised?

16:22.439 --> 16:24.692
Well, your braids.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.402
A law professor can't
have hair like mine?

16:26.485 --> 16:29.530
- Why is that?
- Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't, I didn't mean

16:29.613 --> 16:31.240
because of the braids.
I was, I was--

16:31.323 --> 16:34.118
I, I was just thrown
because the braids

16:34.201 --> 16:36.787
are, are so different than
the hair in your photo

16:36.870 --> 16:38.372
on the Columbia website.

16:38.455 --> 16:39.873
My comment had
nothing whatsoever

16:39.957 --> 16:40.708
to do with it being
a Black hairstyle.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.543
I, I knew that
you were Black

16:42.626 --> 16:44.211
when I signed up
for this class.

16:44.294 --> 16:44.920
Uh, that was
important to me.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.842
You signed up for this class
because I'm Black?

16:49.925 --> 16:52.302
Well, not just
because you're Black.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.221
I picked this class
because...

16:54.304 --> 16:55.264
you're such a force
in academia

16:55.347 --> 16:58.892
on top of everything you do
as a community activist.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.394
God, I sound like
such a brown-nose.

17:00.477 --> 17:02.479
I mean, um...

17:02.563 --> 17:05.232
please just forget

17:05.315 --> 17:07.818
that I ever said
anything about your hair.

17:07.901 --> 17:10.738
Hair has...
nothing whatsoever

17:10.821 --> 17:12.781
to do with, uh,
appropriateness,

17:12.865 --> 17:15.492
or intelligence,
or gravitas, obviously.

17:15.576 --> 17:16.577
I mean, do I look like
someone who attaches

17:16.660 --> 17:18.245
any significance to hair?

17:18.328 --> 17:22.499
I, I let mine go gray,
and I don't care if it
makes me look old.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.419
Not that I'm ageist.
Do I sound ageist?

17:25.502 --> 17:27.337
You really want me
to answer that question?

17:28.672 --> 17:30.799
I am so sorry for
taking everyone's time.

17:30.883 --> 17:31.717
This is not
at all who I am.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.302
I will just be quiet now.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.928
Okay, uh...

17:35.012 --> 17:38.766
- Hi, hi, hello, everyone.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.684
Welcome to
Policies and Principles
of Humanitarian Law.

17:40.768 --> 17:43.061
I am Professor
Nya Wallace,

17:43.145 --> 17:44.938
and before we
delve into this

17:45.022 --> 17:45.647
complicated and important work,

17:45.731 --> 17:48.108
I just want to clear up

17:48.192 --> 17:50.944
that on the Columbia
University website,

17:51.028 --> 17:54.114
- I am rockin' a short
Halle Berry, right?

17:54.198 --> 17:58.577
This is "X, Y, and Me,"
the podcast that talks about

17:58.660 --> 18:01.288
gender roles, sexual roles,
and... cinnamon rolls.

18:01.371 --> 18:04.917
- All the roles I care
passionately about.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.794
Representing the cisgender
women is...

18:06.877 --> 18:07.586
Carrie Bradshaw.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.797
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, Ms. Cis.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.008
And representing
the cishet men is...

18:13.091 --> 18:15.093
the dude himself,
Jackie Nee.

18:15.177 --> 18:18.430
What up, sista-brotha?

18:18.514 --> 18:19.681
That's right because
I'm both and neither.

18:19.765 --> 18:23.310
I am Che Diaz, your host.

18:23.393 --> 18:25.312
And queer, nonbinary,
Mexican, Irish diva

18:25.395 --> 18:28.690
representing everyone
else outside these
two boring genders.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.317
<i>Woke moment!</i>

18:30.400 --> 18:31.693
- And yes, I know
that no one person

18:31.777 --> 18:33.654
can represent all the genders,

18:33.737 --> 18:34.947
and sexual orientations,

18:35.030 --> 18:38.450
or an entire race,
and I, I fully acknowledge

18:38.534 --> 18:41.286
that we are complicated,
diverse beings

18:41.370 --> 18:42.204
here on this wondrous planet

18:42.287 --> 18:45.415
all just striving to be
our very best self.

18:45.499 --> 18:48.168
- Many of us just
tryin' to get laid.

18:48.252 --> 18:48.919
Or at least that's what
we talk about on my show,

18:49.002 --> 18:51.088
so let's figure
some shit out.

18:51.171 --> 18:52.631
- Who's got what?
- I'll go.

18:52.714 --> 18:53.715
Oh, okay.
- Hi, Carrie.

18:53.799 --> 18:54.967
- Hello.
- I have a question

18:55.050 --> 18:56.176
for you about women.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.719
What is it, Jackie?

18:57.803 --> 19:01.014
Why don't you see women
jerkin' it on the subway?

19:01.098 --> 19:03.559
I'm hoping that's
a multiple choice question.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.687
Yeah, good one, Jackie.
I was worried you were gonna
ask something sophomoric,

19:06.770 --> 19:07.896
like, "What can I,
as a straight cis male,

19:07.980 --> 19:10.190
"personally do to eradicate
the harmful patriarchal system

19:10.274 --> 19:13.861
of the gender binary,
and compulsory heterosexuality?"

19:13.944 --> 19:16.780
No, but for serious, I see
dudes masturbating everywhere.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.241
I saw a guy jerkin' off
on the J train today.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.033
I guess that's what
the "J" stands for.

19:20.117 --> 19:23.203
And the "A" train
stands for anal.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.705
- Oh, that must be
why I don't ride it.

19:24.788 --> 19:27.332
<i>Woke moment!</i>

19:27.416 --> 19:29.042
Sexual expression
of any kind should

19:29.126 --> 19:29.751
always be discussed
and consented to

19:29.835 --> 19:31.879
by all parties
involved.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.589
Unless it's just you
and your sex toys.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.424
Then, go ahead!

19:35.507 --> 19:37.050
- Surprise yourself.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.761
All right, let's, uh,
move off the prototypes,

19:39.845 --> 19:42.222
and into the personal.
Jackie--

19:42.306 --> 19:44.641
- Yeah.
- Have you ever masturbated
out in pub--

19:44.725 --> 19:46.393
Nah, you know what?
Let's just speed this along.

19:46.476 --> 19:49.396
Is there any public place
where you haven't masturbated?

19:49.479 --> 19:53.525
- Uh... nah.

19:53.609 --> 19:54.818
I like to masturbate
at Yankee Stadium.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.737
Well, my version
of masturbation.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.196
I, uh, I wear a Yankees cap,

19:58.280 --> 20:01.825
and I just, uh, I sit
there sippin' a beer,

20:01.909 --> 20:03.076
and...

20:03.160 --> 20:04.703
I really get off
on watching

20:04.786 --> 20:06.705
the bros try
to figure out
what I am.

20:06.788 --> 20:09.207
And it's not just the dudes.
It's also the ladies.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.627
- I'm an equal
opportunity confuser.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.211
- What about you, Carrie?
- Oh, me? What? What? What?

20:13.295 --> 20:16.715
Oh. What about,
What about me?
Oh, oh, oh--

20:16.798 --> 20:19.885
Oh, are you ask--
You're asking me about,
about masturbation?

20:19.968 --> 20:22.804
Yes, I'm, I'm asking
you about masturbation.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.139
Particularly you.
Do you masturbate?

20:24.222 --> 20:27.726
Uh, I would like
to buy a vowel, please.

20:31.021 --> 20:33.607
Sorry, I don't--
I don't know
what that means.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.817
Um, okay, yes, sorry.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.903
Let's see. Ooh, yes.
I'm here, okay.

20:38.528 --> 20:41.281
Yes, go. I'm here. Yes.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.116
Um... have you
ever masturbated
in a public place?

20:43.200 --> 20:46.995
Uh, well, uh, not
since Barneys closed.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.872
Hmm.
- Uh, what's Barneys?

20:48.956 --> 20:52.459
Okay, now that's offensive.

20:56.546 --> 20:58.674
What are we thinkin'
time frame-wise about
our next IVF round?

20:58.757 --> 21:01.259
I don't know, Andre.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.511
Uh, my body still feels off
from that last round,

21:02.594 --> 21:05.806
and why're we talkin' about this
as I'm gettin' on mass transit?

21:05.889 --> 21:07.683
Uh, Samuel was just kinda

21:07.766 --> 21:10.018
pushing me about
whether I'm going out
on the tour or not.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.395
- Now you're pushing me?
<i>Am I?</i>

21:11.478 --> 21:15.691
Um, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
My bad. I just--

21:15.774 --> 21:16.858
<i>I didn't wanna
keep him hangin'.</i>

21:16.942 --> 21:18.986
<i>They've been
so good to me.</i>

21:19.069 --> 21:20.362
No, I get that, um...

21:23.115 --> 21:26.827
Uh... I guess what
I'm saying is, um...

21:26.910 --> 21:27.869
I'm feeling--

21:31.707 --> 21:32.624
Can't talk right now.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.875
<i>No, no. Uh, go ahead, Ny.</i>

21:33.959 --> 21:36.378
<i>-You're feelin' what?</i>
- I can't talk right now,
Andre Rashad.

21:36.461 --> 21:39.256
I have a student
lookin' right at me.

21:39.339 --> 21:40.132
Shit, she's comin' over here.

21:40.215 --> 21:44.678
Okay, I gotta go.
Uh, I'll be home soon.

21:44.761 --> 21:47.055
I'll set dinner.
Nothin' but love.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.265
Okay, bye.

21:49.516 --> 21:50.892
I just wanted
to introduce myself

21:50.976 --> 21:52.894
in a non-manic,
non-crazy lady way.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.063
- Oh.
- I'm Miranda Hobbes,

21:55.147 --> 21:56.898
and that, I don't even
know what to call it,

21:56.982 --> 21:58.358
- performance I gave
about your hair--
- It's fine.

21:58.442 --> 22:01.862
- We don't have to do that again.
Oh, I hear ya.

22:01.945 --> 22:03.447
I, I just wanted you
to know that I am,

22:03.530 --> 22:05.991
actually, a serious person,

22:06.074 --> 22:08.744
and that being in your class
means a lot to me.

22:08.827 --> 22:10.370
- I, I quit--

22:11.788 --> 22:12.664
I, uh--

22:12.748 --> 22:14.499
I left corporate law,

22:14.583 --> 22:16.710
recently, after
almost 30 years

22:16.793 --> 22:19.129
because I couldn't be part
of the problem anymore.

22:19.212 --> 22:21.214
I was at home
watching CNN

22:21.298 --> 22:23.675
when the Muslim ban
was initiated,

22:23.759 --> 22:25.844
and I saw all
those attorneys

22:25.927 --> 22:28.221
out at the airport
offering assistance,

22:28.305 --> 22:28.889
and I just--
The next thing I knew,

22:28.972 --> 22:32.350
I was in a cab
goin' to JFK

22:32.434 --> 22:35.270
to do something,
anything because,
you know...

22:36.855 --> 22:39.816
my wearing a pink pussy hat
just wasn't cutting it.

22:39.900 --> 22:43.278
- I'm sorry, I didn't
catch a lot of that.
- Probably just as well.

22:53.288 --> 22:55.832
Hey, Carrie.
You got a minute?

22:55.916 --> 22:58.752
Oh, sure...
That was a funny
show today.

22:58.835 --> 23:01.171
- I like the gloves.
- Oh, thanks.

23:01.254 --> 23:04.257
Yeah, they're really
mostly for elevator
buttons and handrails.

23:04.341 --> 23:07.010
It's just a little
something I started
during the pandemic.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.011
- Seems to be hangin' in there.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.055
So, about today's show,

23:10.138 --> 23:10.764
you need to dialogue
with us more.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.769
Oh, um, no, go ahead.
I'll, I'll ride down with you.

23:15.852 --> 23:16.686
Okay.

23:24.986 --> 23:27.155
Oh, just a few quick puffs.
I'm so wired after a show.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.449
- You want a hit?
- No, I'm, I'm good, thank you.

23:33.870 --> 23:35.956
Yeah, so...

23:36.039 --> 23:38.125
you can't just
sit there giggling.
You know what I mean?

23:38.208 --> 23:41.086
Well, um,

23:41.169 --> 23:42.129
I'm really stronger
when people call in

23:42.212 --> 23:45.382
with relationship
questions.

23:45.465 --> 23:47.300
You know, today turned
kind of raunchy.

23:47.384 --> 23:48.552
Well, that's where
it goes sometimes,

23:48.635 --> 23:51.763
and you need to go
with it, or the trolls
will label you

23:51.847 --> 23:55.142
"the uptight cisgender
female married lady."

23:55.225 --> 23:57.310
- And that's not who you are.
- It's not?

23:57.394 --> 23:59.104
I know you got more.

23:59.187 --> 24:00.480
C'mon, I mean, you had
a column about sexuality

24:00.564 --> 24:03.442
in a mainstream newspaper
in the fuckin' 1990s.

24:03.525 --> 24:07.154
You're the OG.
You... are badass.

24:07.237 --> 24:09.197
Well, you know, that
was writing at a desk.

24:09.281 --> 24:12.784
I'm not a stand-up
like you two.

24:12.868 --> 24:16.329
I'm, I'm not comfortable
with the more graphic content,

24:16.413 --> 24:18.498
you know, it's just--
It's not me.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.250
Hmm, you might wanna
step out of that box.

24:20.333 --> 24:23.753
Surprise yourself.
Just a suggestion.

24:23.837 --> 24:26.173
Well, in, in my defense,
I did do that anal joke

24:26.256 --> 24:28.341
- about not riding the A train.
- That was good!

24:28.425 --> 24:30.927
- See? Don't hold yourself back.
Okay.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.388
You were--
You were so funny
at your job interview.

24:33.471 --> 24:35.599
Yeah, but that was like
our first date, you know?

24:35.682 --> 24:37.767
I gave you all
my good stuff.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.603
Look, I really want
this to work out
for all of us,

24:39.686 --> 24:41.188
so I say this
with love...

24:41.271 --> 24:43.356
ya better step
your pussy up.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.985
- Oh, okay.
- Okay, so what're you gonna do?

24:48.111 --> 24:50.780
I'm gonna...
step my pussy up?

24:50.864 --> 24:53.033
- Hmm, was that a question?
- No.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.951
- Oh.
- I'm gonna step
my pussy up.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.787
Yes!

25:31.446 --> 25:32.614
Do you masturbate?

25:36.785 --> 25:38.870
I feel like that's
a trick question.

25:38.954 --> 25:41.957
- Do you?
- Uh, Senator, I'm gonna
wait for my counsel

25:42.040 --> 25:42.624
before I respond to that.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.836
Is this for your new book?

25:47.963 --> 25:48.463
For the podcast.

25:51.424 --> 25:52.592
I have to step my pussy up.

25:52.676 --> 25:54.135
Well, I don't know what
we're talkin' about,

25:54.219 --> 25:55.470
but I like the sound of it.

25:57.097 --> 25:57.472
Well...

25:59.099 --> 26:00.267
do you?

26:01.685 --> 26:04.062
- Do you?
- Yes.

26:04.145 --> 26:05.230
Well, next time
give me a heads up.

26:05.313 --> 26:06.815
I'd like to attend
that event.

26:06.898 --> 26:09.276
You have my LinkedIn
address, right?

26:17.075 --> 26:17.575
Masturbate for me.

26:19.035 --> 26:20.120
I wanna see you.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.707
- Okay, what are you doing?
- I'm surprising myself.

26:23.790 --> 26:26.626
Well, you're surprising
the hell outta me, too.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.590
Are you gonna join me?

26:32.674 --> 26:35.051
Mm-mm, I just wanna watch.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.470
With or without my glasses?

26:40.223 --> 26:41.391
Ahem...

26:43.810 --> 26:44.477
What're you doing?

26:44.561 --> 26:47.230
Getting some lube.
I'm not 30.

26:48.732 --> 26:50.859
I thought you
were reaching
for your emergency

26:50.942 --> 26:52.652
nitroglycerin pill.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.571
You want me
to masturbate or not?

27:07.834 --> 27:09.502
- Come here.
- Mm-mm.

27:09.586 --> 27:12.797
Just do what you usually do.
Pretend I'm not here.

27:25.143 --> 27:26.019
- Oh, Carrie!

27:26.102 --> 27:29.481
Oh my, Carrie!

27:29.564 --> 27:30.648
I must have you!

27:34.235 --> 27:36.571
- That's some "Bridgerton"
shit there.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.825
- Look at you.

27:58.551 --> 28:00.428
Hello, lovers.

28:12.816 --> 28:15.819
Oh... the weekly cigar,

28:15.902 --> 28:18.113
and Allegra
on the same night?

28:18.196 --> 28:20.907
I'm all in, baby.

28:20.990 --> 28:22.450
Do you notice
anything special?

28:24.244 --> 28:27.747
Nope.

28:27.831 --> 28:31.376
I see the wedding shoes.
How could I not?

28:31.459 --> 28:33.294
Those blue shoes are
the whole ball game.

28:33.378 --> 28:36.005
Hey, I was thinking,
if I get home early enough,

28:36.089 --> 28:37.298
maybe we can drive
out east tonight.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.050
Would you be
up for that?

28:39.134 --> 28:41.511
Depends how spent
I am after Allegra.

28:41.594 --> 28:43.221
All right, well...

28:43.304 --> 28:44.514
just text me
and let me know

28:44.597 --> 28:47.058
and I won't go out
for a drink after.

28:47.851 --> 28:51.729
Okay...
I'll see you later.

28:51.813 --> 28:53.231
Hm?

28:55.400 --> 28:56.276
What?

28:57.402 --> 28:57.735
I'm just looking at you.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.327
All right, tell that whore
Allegra I said bye.

29:13.543 --> 29:17.005
Please put this dress on.
I want us all in florals.

29:17.088 --> 29:17.881
I wanna wear
what I wanna wear.

29:17.964 --> 29:20.341
What is the problem?
It isn't even poofy.

29:20.425 --> 29:23.595
Rose, we're
gonna be late!

29:23.678 --> 29:25.889
- And it's Lily's big night.
- Leave me out of this.

29:25.972 --> 29:27.390
What's the holdup?
What's happenin'?

29:27.474 --> 29:30.101
What's happening
is that Rose won't
wear her dress.

29:30.185 --> 29:32.103
I picked something
else to wear!

29:32.187 --> 29:33.980
Can't she just wear
what she wants to wear?

29:34.063 --> 29:35.482
No, Harry, no.

29:35.565 --> 29:37.484
I bought this
Oscar de la Renta

29:37.567 --> 29:40.737
- special for tonight.
- Okay, okay.

29:42.780 --> 29:45.450
- How about if I wear it?

29:47.368 --> 29:49.370
Rose, baby...

29:50.205 --> 29:50.788
can you just
wear the dress?

29:52.415 --> 29:53.791
Please?

29:53.875 --> 29:55.835
Please. For me?

30:04.677 --> 30:07.138
- Hey, you. I like your outfit.
- It's really cute, right?

30:07.222 --> 30:10.350
Hi, hi, hi!
Sorry we're
a little late!

30:10.433 --> 30:12.101
What the hell is
with that getup?

30:12.185 --> 30:13.853
She looks like
a little Edie Beale.

30:13.937 --> 30:15.396
Anthony, not now.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.482
Not in front of
the Manhattan School
of Music, okay?

30:17.565 --> 30:20.360
Hey, I have
everybody's tickets!

30:21.444 --> 30:24.280
Steve-o,
long time, no see.

30:24.364 --> 30:25.949
- What's new?
- Hey, I got hearing aids.

30:26.032 --> 30:28.326
- I'm an old timer now.
- No, you're not.

30:28.409 --> 30:30.578
You only have
60% hearing loss
in one ear,

30:30.662 --> 30:31.829
and 40%
in the other.

30:31.913 --> 30:33.331
- Yeah, 'cause I'm old.
- Ugh!

30:33.414 --> 30:37.710
- Honey, I think we should get
Lily backstage, don't you?
- Yes, I agree.

30:37.794 --> 30:40.255
Lily!
Here, tickets.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.382
- Brady, here are your tickets.
- Thanks, Mom.

30:42.465 --> 30:44.384
- Good luck!
Are you nervous?
- Not really.

30:44.467 --> 30:48.513
- I've played this piece
like a billion times.
- Oh my god, I wanna be you.

30:48.596 --> 30:51.266
- Go!
- I'll see you all inside!

30:51.349 --> 30:53.309
- Have a good show!
- Oh, Anthony, I gave
Stanford's ticket to Carrie.

30:53.393 --> 30:56.396
- Okay.
- I got it.

30:56.479 --> 30:58.731
- So, where's your better half?
- He's late.

30:58.815 --> 31:01.234
- He couldn't decide
what to wear.
- Of course.

31:01.317 --> 31:04.404
Well, there he is!
Hey, good lookin'!

31:04.487 --> 31:06.906
- Whatcha got cookin'?
- You left?!

31:06.990 --> 31:09.576
- You just left?!
- Oh, we're not
in the same place.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.452
I told you
I wasn't waiting.

31:11.536 --> 31:13.329
What kind
of person
just leaves?

31:13.413 --> 31:15.915
- Steve, would you ever
just leave Miranda?
- Oh, boy.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.542
What?
What he say?

31:17.625 --> 31:20.253
You were picking
out a suit for
an hour and a half.

31:20.336 --> 31:21.504
Periwinkle or tan?
Periwinkle or tan?

31:21.588 --> 31:23.756
It didn't
friggin' matter!

31:23.840 --> 31:26.968
I'm goin' in.
Carrie has your ticket.

31:27.051 --> 31:29.053
- I do.
- Did I kiss you hello yet?

31:29.137 --> 31:32.223
Mm-mm.
What was all that?

31:32.307 --> 31:36.603
- Us on a good night.
- Oh, Lord.

31:36.686 --> 31:39.564
Everyone was looking at me
like I was the white lady

31:39.647 --> 31:41.232
who couldn't stop
saying the word "Black."

31:41.316 --> 31:43.192
It's a miracle nobody
pulled out their phone,

31:43.276 --> 31:44.944
or I would be
a meme now.

31:45.028 --> 31:47.196
What do you
think was goin'
on with you?

31:47.280 --> 31:48.781
I think I was
just so worried

31:48.865 --> 31:51.034
about saying the wrong
thing in this climate

31:51.117 --> 31:52.994
that I said all
the wrong things.

31:53.077 --> 31:55.288
I'm sure you didn't say
all the wrong things.

31:55.371 --> 31:57.999
You're right.
I'll probably blurt out
some new ones tomorrow.

31:59.542 --> 32:01.961
God, is this even moving?
I really have to go.

32:02.045 --> 32:05.131
Well, there's no line
for the men's room,
as usual.

32:05.214 --> 32:07.800
Fuck it. I'm 55,
and I have to pee.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.677
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the show is about to begin.</i>

32:09.761 --> 32:11.804
<i>Please find your
way to your seats.</i>

32:11.888 --> 32:14.599
It's funny, you
couldn't stop talking,

32:14.682 --> 32:17.185
and my boss told me if
I wanna keep my podcast job,

32:17.268 --> 32:18.728
which I do, I'm gonna
have to start talking,

32:18.811 --> 32:22.607
and a lot more
graphically about sex.

32:22.690 --> 32:23.858
That's not who you are.

32:23.941 --> 32:27.403
Well, we can't stay
who we were, right?

32:29.405 --> 32:31.074
Oh, yeah, no, you're
in the right place.

32:31.157 --> 32:32.950
Sorry, I'm just standing
guard for my friend.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.369
She'll be done
any second now.

32:34.452 --> 32:36.663
- See?

32:36.746 --> 32:39.666
- Just--
- Hey.

32:42.168 --> 32:45.004
- Hello, again.
- Oh yeah.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.965
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.

32:48.049 --> 32:50.009
- Hey, where's Stanny?
- He's in the balcony.

32:50.093 --> 32:51.844
He'll meet ya
in the lobby to go
for a drink after.

32:51.928 --> 32:55.848
Hope you like your Cosmos
with a side of drama.

32:55.932 --> 32:58.059
Charlotte gave
his seat to Rose.

32:58.142 --> 33:00.853
- Well, what's he doing
in the balcony?
- Actin' out.

33:00.937 --> 33:04.816
Accused me of scrollin'
hot boys at a friggin'
kids' piano recital.

33:04.899 --> 33:07.193
- Well, what're you doin'?
- Scrollin' hot boys...

33:07.276 --> 33:08.736
for my sourdough
business.

33:08.820 --> 33:09.904
Hotfellas Bread
is not gonna find

33:09.987 --> 33:12.615
its own hot fellas
to deliver the bread.

33:12.699 --> 33:13.074
So true.

33:15.368 --> 33:16.911
- Well, what about him?
- Unavail.

33:16.994 --> 33:18.746
Well, he's hot.
- Unavail.

33:19.455 --> 33:23.876
Not hot, not hot, not hot.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.045
- Well, he looks like
he could kill you.
- Hot.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.755
Who wants wine?
Carrie?

33:27.839 --> 33:31.718
Oh, sure.
I love some
good purse wine.

33:31.801 --> 33:34.929
Hi, Charlotte.
- Hi, how are you?

33:35.012 --> 33:36.723
Miranda.

33:36.806 --> 33:41.060
What?
I had a rough
first day of school,

33:41.144 --> 33:43.354
and I'm lookin' at two
hours of tween Mozart.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.399
Let it go.

33:46.482 --> 33:49.068
- Charlotte... Hi!
- Hi!

33:49.152 --> 33:50.820
I wanted you to meet
my mother-in-law,
Eunice Wexley.

33:50.903 --> 33:54.073
- Oh, it is so nice to meet you.
- Hello.

33:54.157 --> 33:58.161
- Uh, Lisa, where am I seated?
- I have you seated here

33:58.244 --> 34:00.246
with Herbert Jr.
and Gabrielle in this row

34:00.329 --> 34:03.040
right in front of
Herbert and myself.

34:03.124 --> 34:04.333
This far back?

34:04.834 --> 34:07.044
Yes... God.

34:07.128 --> 34:09.589
Miranda brought wine.

34:09.672 --> 34:11.424
She had a rough
first day of school.

34:11.507 --> 34:13.593
My hero.
May I have some?

34:13.676 --> 34:15.052
Here, give that
to Black Charlotte.

34:17.889 --> 34:21.017
- You sure you good?
- I got this.

34:21.100 --> 34:23.144
All right,
you got this.

34:48.044 --> 34:49.712
All right, uh,
he don't got this.

34:49.796 --> 34:50.797
No.

35:06.020 --> 35:08.356
I think my soul
just left my body.

35:13.027 --> 35:16.280
- Pass.
Don't you
want to know what it is?

35:16.364 --> 35:18.282
Is it alcoholic
in nature?

35:19.575 --> 35:20.910
Then pass.

35:21.327 --> 35:22.370
Thank you.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.881
<i>Welcome to Peloton.
I'm Allegra Planche,</i>

35:33.965 --> 35:35.341

35:35.424 --> 35:37.969
<i>for this 45-minute power ride.</i>

35:38.052 --> 35:39.554
<i>-Let's go!</i>
- Yes!

35:48.104 --> 35:51.440
- Tell your son to stop.
- What?

35:52.775 --> 35:54.277
They're making out.

35:55.444 --> 35:58.865
It's your turn.
I can't always
be the bad guy.

35:58.948 --> 36:01.576
- Mom, we will not
be sex-shamed.

36:01.659 --> 36:03.286
Tell Luisa
I got the message.

36:18.551 --> 36:22.513
(playing "Piano Sonata
No. 14 in C Sharp Minor"
by Beethoven)

36:45.536 --> 36:48.414
<i>In three, two, one,
pick it up!</i>

37:02.219 --> 37:02.762
<i>Ah, sí, señor!</i>

37:19.028 --> 37:22.281
<i>Now, we sprint.

<i>Celebrate yourself!</i>

37:39.006 --> 37:41.175
<i>We have

37:41.259 --> 37:43.135
<i>Three, two, one,</i> arriba!

37:47.932 --> 37:51.310
<i>Now we sprint!

38:27.430 --> 38:27.471
Shit!

39:04.133 --> 39:05.885
Woo!

39:05.968 --> 39:07.261
Woo!

39:10.639 --> 39:11.640
Thanks, thanks.

39:11.724 --> 39:15.478
I need to stay
at your old apartment
again tonight.

39:15.561 --> 39:17.021
I'm not going
home to that

39:17.104 --> 39:20.066
selfish, self-involved,
sourdough Mussolini.

39:20.149 --> 39:21.400
I can't get a drink.

39:21.484 --> 39:22.610
Big and I are gonna drive
out to the beach tonight.

39:22.693 --> 39:24.153
Oh, fuck me.

39:24.236 --> 39:27.823
I'm sorry. Here.
Here's the key.

39:27.907 --> 39:30.409
Oh, go.
I had one made
after our last fight.

39:32.244 --> 39:32.578
- Nighty-night.
- Good night.

39:32.661 --> 39:34.246
Good night.

39:35.998 --> 39:38.709
- Oh, oh.

39:47.468 --> 39:48.969
Hmm.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.269
- I'm here.

40:17.873 --> 40:18.874
John?

40:38.519 --> 40:39.728
John!

40:41.605 --> 40:42.022
Oh god!

40:42.106 --> 40:44.817
Oh god, John! Oh!

40:44.900 --> 40:45.526
John! Honey!

40:47.069 --> 40:49.655
John! Honey?

40:49.738 --> 40:50.573
Oh!

40:52.366 --> 40:55.411

40:55.494 --> 40:57.580

40:58.414 --> 40:59.206
John.

41:01.292 --> 41:01.458
John.

41:10.926 --> 41:14.972
Oh god!

41:16.265 --> 41:17.474
John. John.

41:19.435 --> 41:19.685
John.

41:19.768 --> 41:21.729
John.

41:21.812 --> 41:22.646
