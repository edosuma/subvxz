HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
EDDIE AND SHAUNI

38:19.993 --> 38:21.299
WILL STAY IN AUSTRALIA?

38:21.951 --> 38:23.605
AT LEAST A YEAR.

38:23.736 --> 38:25.477
BUT THE LIFEGUARD COMPETITION
IS GOING TO BE HELD

38:25.607 --> 38:27.261
DOWN THERE NEXT YEAR.
MAYBE WE'LL GO SEE THEM.

38:27.392 --> 38:28.349
OKAY.

38:28.915 --> 38:30.830
MAYBE IF THE BOOT
HADN'T GONE DOWN UNDER,

38:31.657 --> 38:34.486
WE'D GO THERE ON A BIG,
GIGANTIC, LUXURIOUS YACHT.

38:36.966 --> 38:38.707
WELL, HOBSTER, SOMETIMES
YOU LOSE SOMETHING

38:38.838 --> 38:40.666
THAT SEEMS IRREPLACEABLE,

38:40.796 --> 38:42.842
ONLY TO HAVE SOMETHING EVEN
BETTER COME ALONG IN ITS PLACE.

38:43.451 --> 38:44.322
DAD?

38:44.931 --> 38:46.585
IF WE GOT REALLY RICH,

38:46.846 --> 38:48.282
WOULD YOU STILL BE A LIFEGUARD?

38:49.283 --> 38:50.371
ABSOLUTELY.

38:51.198 --> 38:52.025
HOW COME?

38:53.026 --> 38:54.723
WELL, I'M TOO YOUNG TO RETIRE,

38:54.854 --> 38:56.116
AND I CAN'T THINK
OF ANY OTHER JOB

38:56.246 --> 38:57.073
I'D RATHER HAVE.

38:57.726 --> 38:59.598
YEAH. ME, TOO.

38:59.728 --> 39:01.991
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB.

39:02.122 --> 39:04.342
HEY,
BEING YOUR SON IS A LOT OF WORK.

39:04.472 --> 39:05.560
REALLY?

39:05.691 --> 39:07.736
YEAH. YOU GET SHOT AT.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.738
YOU GO DOWN WATERFALLS.

39:09.869 --> 39:11.784
YOUR DAD GETS TRAPPED
IN A CRYPT.

39:12.306 --> 39:13.699
AND PLUS...

39:14.047 --> 39:17.746
YOU GOT TO WEAR THESE
REALLY STUPID PENGUIN SUITS.

39:19.139 --> 39:20.227
I'M GOING IN.

39:20.836 --> 39:21.707
YOU'RE NOT GOING IN.

39:21.837 --> 39:23.230
YES, I AM.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.753
YOU'RE NOT GOING--
YOU'RE NOT GOING IN.

39:24.884 --> 39:26.755
HEY! THAT TUXEDO IS A RENTAL!

39:26.886 --> 39:28.061
