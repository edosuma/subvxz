WEBVTT

00:53.962 --> 00:57.508
- What is the verdict?
- Guilty, Your Grace.

00:57.716 --> 00:59.885
All of them?

01:00.594 --> 01:02.220
Guilty.

02:26.179 --> 02:31.351
* Farewell, farewell
My pleasure past

02:31.560 --> 02:36.273
* Welcome my present pain

02:36.481 --> 02:41.069
* Welcome the torment in my heart

02:41.319 --> 02:46.408
* To see my love again *

03:13.185 --> 03:16.980
Warrant for the execution of
Sir Henry Norris for adultery with Annee,

03:17.189 --> 03:19.232
Queen of England.

03:21.944 --> 03:26.156
For the execution of Mark Smeaton
for the treason of adultery with Annee,

03:26.364 --> 03:27.991
Queen of England.

03:28.200 --> 03:32.538
To the Lieutenant Governor of the Tower
of London a warrant for the execution...

03:34.414 --> 03:37.835
...of Annee, Queen of England.

03:38.043 --> 03:40.378
For adultery and treason.

03:41.714 --> 03:45.133
To be burned or beheaded
at the King's pleasure.

03:46.635 --> 03:50.681
Annee, Queen of England.

03:52.015 --> 03:53.266
My wife.

03:56.144 --> 03:57.229
My wife, Cromwell.

03:57.437 --> 04:01.734
She has borne you a useless daughter
and a dead son.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.612
When we married she promised me a son.

04:04.862 --> 04:07.072
I must have a son to rule
when I am dead.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.534
God guided the conscience
and answered prayers of the King.

04:10.784 --> 04:14.496
- He will not let you condemn unjustly.
- Then why do I hesitate?

04:14.705 --> 04:17.791
Is the hesitation from God?

04:18.041 --> 04:22.337
Or is He telling me you must die, you
who found evidence and arranged trial?

04:22.546 --> 04:25.423
I care only that the King rules
absolutely.

04:25.633 --> 04:30.345
The Queen despised her marriage
and indulged her carnal lust.

04:30.554 --> 04:32.681
Betrayed me?

04:32.890 --> 04:34.642
Did she, Cromwell? Did she?

04:34.850 --> 04:41.314
Your Grace, the Queen betrayed you
and stands condemned.

04:41.524 --> 04:44.735
The warrant is before you.

04:46.695 --> 04:49.489
If she betrayed me, she must die.

04:49.698 --> 04:53.035
If I am to rule, keep my sanity,
and hold England off the rocks,

04:53.243 --> 04:56.872
and as you say, God would not
allow me to condemn unjustly.

04:57.080 --> 05:01.251
If I question that, I question
my whole life and all I’ve done.

05:05.005 --> 05:08.383
At times, I do question it.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.847
Write it down.

05:14.097 --> 05:17.434
Write down Henry Rex and it's done.

05:17.643 --> 05:21.146
I’ve condemned men before,
nobles and peasants, why not a queen?

05:21.354 --> 05:24.942
She struck down a few herself
or driven me to do it for her.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.654
It's only...

05:28.862 --> 05:32.700
It’s only that when you've
held a woman in your arms

05:32.908 --> 05:35.536
and longed for her when she's away,

05:35.744 --> 05:37.454
suffered with her

05:37.663 --> 05:41.249
and waited with her
for the outcome of the child bed...

05:44.795 --> 05:47.548
You promised me a son.

05:47.756 --> 05:49.675
Annee.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.677
Annee!

06:32.801 --> 06:34.762
She's new.

06:34.970 --> 06:39.892
Boleyn's youngest daughter.
Newly returned from the French court.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.769
Do you like her, Kate?

06:41.977 --> 06:44.980
Shall we keep her here at court
to cheer you?

06:46.273 --> 06:48.901
Whatever you command, My Lord.

06:49.109 --> 06:52.029
And suppose I command you
to give me a son?

06:53.113 --> 06:55.198
- Would to God I could, Henry.
- Amen.

06:55.407 --> 07:00.370
But you cAnneot, because our marriage
is accursed in heaven and hell, madam.

07:14.259 --> 07:17.763
Play on. Play on.
The Queen wishes it and I command it.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.682
Play!

07:39.492 --> 07:43.038
When I call for it,
tell the musicians to play my galliard.

07:44.414 --> 07:47.417
And see to it, More,
that there is no argument.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.878
My Lord Bishop.

07:53.966 --> 07:56.093
Your Majesty.

07:59.763 --> 08:02.474
- If it please Your Grace...
- No politics, Wolsey.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.060
Go and commune with the devil
while I dance.

08:05.268 --> 08:07.730
No, just a simple domestic matter.
A wedding.

08:08.021 --> 08:11.483
Any man who marries
when he can be free is a fool.

08:13.694 --> 08:17.531
Here. Here is the couple.

08:19.157 --> 08:23.036
Young Percy, Northumberland's son.
He's a member of my household.

08:23.286 --> 08:24.872
And Annee Boleyn.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.250
Their parents agreed.
Have they your permission to marry?

08:28.501 --> 08:29.960
- I’ve told them...
- No.

08:30.168 --> 08:33.005
- "No", did Your Grace say?
- No.

08:33.212 --> 08:37.342
- But it is a love match.
- Un-match them, Wolsey, unmatch them.

08:37.551 --> 08:41.471
And send the Boleyns, father,
mother, son and eldest daughter,

08:41.722 --> 08:45.851
back to their castle in Kent,
and send Annee with them tonight.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.853
Yes, sir.

08:49.354 --> 08:53.567
I’m bored, Wolsey.
I’m bored with the court.

08:53.776 --> 08:58.238
Bored with my Spanish cow.

08:58.446 --> 09:00.533
I shall go hunting

09:00.741 --> 09:03.201
in the beautiful country of Kent.

09:04.870 --> 09:06.371
- Your Grace.
- No ceremony.

09:06.580 --> 09:09.750
I have a mind to put you all to shame.
You're short of breath.

09:09.958 --> 09:11.752
- A misspent life, sir.
- No doubt.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.296
Brereton, you keep time like a deaf man.

09:14.505 --> 09:19.467
- Your Grace has learned my secret.
- Norfolk, sit by the fire at your age.

09:19.677 --> 09:23.388
- Better to lie by it, Your Grace.
- Yes, but with whom?

09:23.597 --> 09:28.018
Percy, you have feet of lead,
a northern clodhopper.

09:28.226 --> 09:30.187
With your permission,

09:30.395 --> 09:34.441
Mistress Annee, will you teach the King
how they dance at the court of France?

09:34.692 --> 09:37.945
There is nothing France
can teach England, Your Majesty.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.406
Well said.

09:42.157 --> 09:43.659
Well said.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.416
The galliard. Play.

10:50.809 --> 10:53.186
My Lord?

10:53.395 --> 10:55.773
Tell Boleyn
I wish to speak to him privately.

10:56.023 --> 10:59.777
- Yes, My Lord.
- And then prepare for a journey.

10:59.985 --> 11:02.362
- A journey?
- Yes.

11:02.571 --> 11:06.784
For where the dove is
the hawk will not be far behind.

11:06.992 --> 11:09.953
To Hever Castle in Kent.

11:10.871 --> 11:14.041
Mary, it must be said,
the King wishes to see me alone.

11:14.249 --> 11:16.126
He asked not to see me?

11:16.334 --> 11:18.336
Not directly.

11:20.047 --> 11:22.174
That could mean he's finished with me.

11:22.758 --> 11:25.844
Has he? Tell me the truth.

11:26.053 --> 11:30.974
One never gets used to these things.
There is always a hell to go through.

11:31.183 --> 11:34.102
When a girl gives herself
so completely...

11:34.311 --> 11:37.648
You know why I gave myself to the King.

11:37.898 --> 11:41.443
Since I opened my bedroom door to him,
you've lived well by it.

11:41.652 --> 11:43.737
Steward of Tonbridge and Penshurst.

11:43.987 --> 11:46.406
Sheriff of Bradsted. Viscount.

11:46.615 --> 11:48.450
And now King's Treasurer.

11:48.659 --> 11:51.579
You don't want to lose those revenues,
do you, Father?

11:51.787 --> 11:55.498
Mary, I have always loved you.
All those things are true.

11:55.708 --> 12:00.337
The King was generous to me
because you were generous to him.

12:00.546 --> 12:04.633
But you're a fool because you gave him
everything and asked for nothing.

12:04.842 --> 12:07.511
What His Majesty is denied,
he goes mad to obtain.

12:07.720 --> 12:11.682
What he gets freely, he despises.
You have lost him.

12:11.890 --> 12:15.018
I can't help you.
Go now and cause no trouble.

12:15.227 --> 12:18.063
I will not have you
put the rest of us at risk.

12:21.441 --> 12:24.945
- What ails you?
- Ask our beloved father.

12:26.279 --> 12:29.032
Father, the Lord Cardinal is here.

12:47.510 --> 12:51.138
- Boleyn. I see you've told the lady.
- Yes, My Lord.

12:51.346 --> 12:52.890
- And Annee?
- No.

12:53.140 --> 12:57.019
- Why not? The King is almost here.
- Like you, I encouraged her with Percy.

12:57.269 --> 13:00.438
It never entered my head
that the King would look at her.

13:00.648 --> 13:02.065
My Lord, the King is here.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.527
- There is no time...
- Leave the girl to me.

13:04.735 --> 13:08.113
Tell the King what rubbish you please,
but give me time.

13:08.321 --> 13:11.534
As for young Percy,
he'll do as I bid him.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.320
Whoa, boy.

14:03.251 --> 14:04.252
Your Majesty.

14:04.503 --> 14:07.840
Only your King, Thomas.
No ceremony. Only your Henry.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.883
This is a great honour.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.279
From Harry Percy?

15:02.477 --> 15:05.188
Where is Annee, Lady Elizabeth?

15:09.234 --> 15:12.112
I found this in her room.

15:14.865 --> 15:18.661
- How is the Vicar of Hell this morning?
- Warm enough, Your Majesty.

15:18.911 --> 15:22.247
To be active on the King's business
generates a certain heat.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.667
Yes, with your feet
on the devil's fender

15:24.875 --> 15:27.377
and your buttocks toasting
at God's altar.

15:28.336 --> 15:31.048
- Has he spoken to you?
- He has, Your Grace.

15:31.256 --> 15:33.676
Good. Good.

15:40.683 --> 15:43.644
And when may I smell this
pretty posy of yours?

15:43.852 --> 15:47.731
If you mean Annee, sir,
she is still at her mirror.

15:47.940 --> 15:51.985
A new dress, nervous fingers. If you
could give her half an hour, perhaps?

15:52.194 --> 15:55.322
- We have this whole day, Thomas.
- I’ve a new pack of hounds

15:55.573 --> 15:57.783
and there's a clump of deer
in the meadow.

15:57.991 --> 16:00.536
- We'll see one, hunt the other.
- Good hunting.

16:00.744 --> 16:03.914
- You'll not be with us?
- It appears there are two poor souls

16:04.122 --> 16:06.208
who seek religious comfort.
I must go.

16:06.416 --> 16:10.087
Indeed, My Lord Cardinal, indeed.
God's work must come first.

16:10.295 --> 16:13.924
And, who knows, there may be
a little worldly profit attached.

16:14.132 --> 16:15.676
Oh, Your Majesty...

16:24.226 --> 16:26.645
Find them, bring them to me.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.822
Thomas, a private word with you
before I meet Annee.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.073
Yes, Your Grace?

16:38.323 --> 16:41.284
There is always a temptation
for a man in my position

16:41.493 --> 16:46.039
to regard the nation as his own trough
and to eat from one end to the other.

16:46.248 --> 16:48.917
- Not Your Grace.
- Why not? Who can say no to me?

16:49.126 --> 16:51.587
Except God, and He does, Thomas.

16:51.795 --> 16:54.381
I kneel. I pray. He answers.

16:54.632 --> 16:57.050
But can that be seen to be so?

16:57.259 --> 17:01.221
Why else would His Holiness the Pope
have named you Defender of the Faith?

17:01.429 --> 17:04.724
True. True.
I am a religious man.

17:04.933 --> 17:09.855
I want to do right by God
and the Church,

17:10.063 --> 17:15.152
and the people and myself,
and you, Thomas.

17:15.359 --> 17:17.279
Do you follow?

17:17.487 --> 17:21.909
That's a swathe of folk to satisfy,
if it includes God, Your Grace.

17:22.159 --> 17:24.368
It includes your two daughters, Thomas.

17:24.578 --> 17:27.164
- Are they friends?
- Yes.

17:27.372 --> 17:30.042
And do they exchange confidences,
do you think?

17:30.250 --> 17:34.713
Do they whisper together at night
secrets about me, perhaps?

17:34.922 --> 17:36.715
Who knows, Your Grace?

17:36.924 --> 17:39.885
The one you have had,
the other you desire.

17:41.178 --> 17:45.223
Will Annee have me, and for myself?

17:45.432 --> 17:49.144
- I want an honest answer.
- She's no fool, My Lord.

17:50.563 --> 17:53.524
Good. Good.

17:53.732 --> 17:57.235
What I do is God's will
and my prayer always is

17:57.444 --> 18:01.073
that He will allow no thought
to enter my heart or mind

18:01.281 --> 18:02.908
that is not His will.

18:03.116 --> 18:06.286
He has...
He has never failed me, Thomas.

18:06.494 --> 18:09.081
But Your Majesty realizes
this might seem as...

18:09.289 --> 18:11.124
As what?

18:11.333 --> 18:14.503
As an excuse to do as you please,

18:14.712 --> 18:17.172
to eat the trough dry.

18:17.840 --> 18:22.469
I’m the King of England.
When I pray, God answers.

18:24.179 --> 18:25.848
Yes, Your Grace.

18:26.056 --> 18:29.392
And let no man dare question that.

18:35.232 --> 18:37.025
Or woman.

19:25.616 --> 19:26.950
Again.

19:31.454 --> 19:34.249
- I’m angry with myself.
- Why?

19:34.499 --> 19:37.460
Well, think of the years I spent
at the French court.

19:37.670 --> 19:41.674
I was surrounded by gallant,
captivating, exquisite French courtiers

19:41.882 --> 19:44.092
and I loved none of them.

19:44.301 --> 19:46.929
No sooner do I return
than I fall in love with a...

19:47.137 --> 19:49.807
- "Clodhopper", said His Majesty.
- He was right.

19:50.015 --> 19:52.518
No mAnneers, can't dance,
can't sing, can't...

19:52.768 --> 19:57.272
- Can put his arms around you.
- Not as well as I’ve known it done.

19:57.480 --> 20:01.944
But they are the arms I want,
for some God knows what reason.

20:02.152 --> 20:05.238
I love your awkwardness.

20:06.073 --> 20:09.618
But if we love enough to marry,
we must keep nothing back.

20:09.827 --> 20:11.745
So?

20:12.495 --> 20:17.501
- Are we to bed together? Before?
- If you like.

20:18.836 --> 20:20.420
Kiss me.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.640
Are you a virgin?

20:31.849 --> 20:35.102
- I’m a man.
- I know, but are you a virgin?

20:35.310 --> 20:38.146
When we bed together,
shall I be your first?

20:38.355 --> 20:40.524
- I...
- Speak out.

20:40.733 --> 20:43.235
Well, I’ll say it frankly
as they do in France.

20:43.443 --> 20:47.364
In England we make muddy mysteries
of such things as if they were crimes.

20:47.573 --> 20:51.493
We don't come out of a rainbow at 17
and there's no use pretending we do.

20:51.660 --> 20:54.246
You may ask me whatever you like.

20:54.454 --> 20:57.708
- Are you a virgin?
- No.

20:59.960 --> 21:04.131
- In France?
- Yes. And long before.

21:04.965 --> 21:06.133
When I was little,

21:06.341 --> 21:10.095
I was playing with a boy
and he threw me down...

21:18.562 --> 21:21.023
The King refuses you
permission to marry.

21:21.857 --> 21:24.067
- But...
- Why? Why, My Lord?

21:24.317 --> 21:26.904
Marriages of the nobility
are affairs of State.

21:27.112 --> 21:28.656
I was wrong to encourage you.

21:28.864 --> 21:32.325
The King wishes you to marry
a daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury.

21:32.576 --> 21:34.870
I am pledged to Annee.
It is a good match.

21:35.078 --> 21:38.957
I brought you to court. You're a member
of my household. You will obey.

21:39.166 --> 21:42.503
The world knew we meant to marry.
Nothing was said against it.

21:42.711 --> 21:45.172
You've heard the King's pleasure
against it.

21:45.380 --> 21:48.466
A half grown steer and a leggy girl

21:48.676 --> 21:51.595
will not be allowed
to overturn the policies of State.

21:51.762 --> 21:53.597
Why was nothing said?

21:53.847 --> 21:56.517
Her father, my father,
and you, My Lord Cardinal,

21:56.725 --> 21:59.520
who knows the King's business
better than himself.

21:59.728 --> 22:00.979
Be silent!

22:01.188 --> 22:03.649
You will obey
or your estates will be forfeit.

22:03.857 --> 22:08.696
If you show further disloyalty,
it's doubtful how long you'll live.

22:08.904 --> 22:12.490
The Duke of Buckingham
lost his head for less. Now go.

22:13.033 --> 22:15.077
You must go.

22:16.662 --> 22:17.788
Kiss me, then.

22:17.996 --> 22:20.165
Don't touch her.

22:25.253 --> 22:30.133
- Be careful of yourself.
- I will, for you.

22:37.808 --> 22:42.020
My Lord, I love him truly

22:42.229 --> 22:45.065
and we are pledged to each other.

22:45.273 --> 22:47.693
If you force him to marry elsewhere,

22:47.943 --> 22:50.946
although I am only a girl,
you'll know you have an enemy.

22:51.154 --> 22:52.615
Madam, you do me wrong.

22:52.823 --> 22:55.826
I have no spleen against you,
I am only a messenger.

22:56.034 --> 22:59.580
Messenger? Who has chosen for me?

22:59.788 --> 23:04.793
When Henry of England
turns his eyes on a girl,

23:05.002 --> 23:08.338
she can hardly look away.

23:10.132 --> 23:14.052
- The King has asked for me?
- He has.

23:14.302 --> 23:16.764
And sent you to me?

23:16.972 --> 23:21.143
It is sometimes my duty
to anticipate his desires.

23:21.351 --> 23:24.855
Even in carnal matters,
My Lord Cardinal?

23:25.063 --> 23:29.317
We have had the King in the bosom
of this family for some years.

23:29.568 --> 23:33.614
My sister Mary is with child by him
and of no further use.

23:33.822 --> 23:37.117
I shall not go the way of my sister.

23:37.325 --> 23:39.537
You would be wise to anticipate
my answer

23:39.787 --> 23:42.831
and spare His Majesty any Anneoyance.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.333
I will not be a mistress of the King

23:45.543 --> 23:48.170
even with the blessing
of a prince of the Church.

24:01.183 --> 24:04.311
- Good sport in Boleyn's woods.
- And in his bowers.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.271
I heard you, Norris.

24:06.479 --> 24:09.775
Well, you two, tell me,
man to man, all kingship aside,

24:09.983 --> 24:12.444
- what's the best way to win a maid?
- A maid?

24:12.653 --> 24:16.031
I couldn't swear to it medically,
but it's young and it's wild.

24:16.239 --> 24:18.909
My skills are not for
the grade of female you seek.

24:19.117 --> 24:21.579
I’m more successful with waiting women.

24:21.787 --> 24:24.456
Don't be modest.
I’ve followed your spoor so close

24:24.707 --> 24:27.459
there was scarce time
to close the window you left by

24:27.710 --> 24:30.003
or change perfumes
to put me off the scent.

24:30.212 --> 24:32.422
Speak on, your lure,
your most seductive.

24:32.673 --> 24:35.926
- You'll not be offended?
- I’ll be offended if you hold back.

24:36.134 --> 24:40.931
If you truly want her, make her believe
that you are potent only with her.

24:41.139 --> 24:43.350
Pretend that you've tried with others.

24:43.559 --> 24:48.647
Gone to bed, kissed hotly,
but hung embarrassed and unable.

24:48.856 --> 24:51.692
But with her you rouse up.
You're a man again.

24:51.900 --> 24:54.194
They can't resist that.
They open like...

24:54.402 --> 24:59.867
Never mind the simile.
Yes. What a game. What a ploy.

25:00.075 --> 25:03.746
Dare I ask, has Your Grace
ever been refused by a wench?

25:03.954 --> 25:05.706
Who? I? Refused? Why, never.

25:05.914 --> 25:09.710
When I’ve wanted them, I’ve had them.
When I’ve had a wench, I’m cured.

25:09.918 --> 25:11.837
That's general, isn't it?

25:12.045 --> 25:16.759
Your Grace, can you all leave talking
of virgins to look at the venison?

25:16.967 --> 25:20.220
Yes, yes. Come, come.
Next to the haunch of a virgin,

25:20.428 --> 25:23.431
there's nothing
like a haunch of venison.

25:26.644 --> 25:29.062
Do you also offer me up
to this royal bull?

25:29.271 --> 25:31.148
You, my father?
And you, my mother?

25:31.356 --> 25:34.943
- Lower your voice!
- Do you know what it is to be in love?

25:35.152 --> 25:39.782
- I love Harry Percy and will marry him.
- You'll have us all dead or disgraced.

25:39.990 --> 25:43.410
Lower your voice.
The royal bull can't force you.

25:43.619 --> 25:45.245
Brother, I must fight. I must.

25:45.453 --> 25:47.998
Do you know what it means
when a king asks for you?

25:48.248 --> 25:50.458
I can ask my pregnant
and foolish sister.

25:50.668 --> 25:53.921
Turn him away and we can say farewell
to all we've worked for.

25:54.171 --> 25:57.758
If our parents had not taken advantage
what would've become of us?

25:57.966 --> 26:00.010
If we lose favour, we lose everything.

26:00.260 --> 26:04.807
Then say goodbye to it all,
for I will not take the King to my bed!

26:05.015 --> 26:06.725
Your Majesty.

26:13.816 --> 26:16.694
I was so anxious to see you, madam,
I ran ahead.

26:16.902 --> 26:20.405
Have you been faithful to me
or lying about with this husband?

26:20.656 --> 26:23.116
Remarkable women you breed, you Howards.

26:23.325 --> 26:24.952
[laughter]

26:25.160 --> 26:26.954
Norfolk, greet your sister.

26:27.162 --> 26:30.123
I’ve brought your brother
to make sure I was welcome.

26:30.332 --> 26:34.962
George, you should have hunted with us
and not stayed at home with the ladies.

26:38.799 --> 26:40.759
Nan.

26:41.009 --> 26:44.972
- Give me a kiss.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

26:50.561 --> 26:52.605
And now on the lips, sweet Nan.

26:52.813 --> 26:56.525
I’ve been taking medicines for a cold.
My breath is foul, Your Grace.

26:56.734 --> 26:59.945
Your health is very dear to us.
You must needs keep well.

27:00.153 --> 27:01.905
We live all too brief a span.

27:02.114 --> 27:04.992
What little we have
should not be wasted.

27:24.094 --> 27:27.556
Well, there's no trace of medicine
or fever on these sweet lips.

27:30.142 --> 27:33.353
The surprise of Your Majesty's visit
must have cured me.

27:33.562 --> 27:37.733
Wonderful. I shall continue the cure.
Shall I dismiss the chaperones?

27:37.941 --> 27:41.278
- By your leave.
- Yes, by your leave.

27:41.486 --> 27:42.821
Yes, without your leave.

27:43.030 --> 27:45.533
Off. Out. All of you, go.

27:45.741 --> 27:48.619
Companions, brothers.

27:48.827 --> 27:52.039
Lawyer. Go.

27:56.919 --> 28:02.382
Annee, you see before you
not the King, but a poor fellow

28:02.633 --> 28:07.930
as uncertain, as eager,
as hopeful, as afraid

28:08.138 --> 28:10.724
as any man that ever fell in love.

28:10.933 --> 28:12.475
I see the King.

28:13.769 --> 28:17.439
Believe me, all kingship on one side.

28:17.648 --> 28:22.653
Women give love to the King
like paying taxes.

28:22.903 --> 28:24.947
I wish to be loved for myself.

28:25.155 --> 28:27.700
Well, as you say you're not the King,

28:27.908 --> 28:32.454
but only a poor, uncertain,
eager, hopeful fellow.

28:32.663 --> 28:37.543
Could you tell me why the King sent an
old Church pander to give me my orders?

28:37.751 --> 28:39.878
- Pander?
- The Lord Cardinal Wolsey.

28:40.087 --> 28:42.464
Oh. Did he speak clumsily?

28:42.673 --> 28:44.717
No, Your Grace.
He spoke to the point.

28:44.925 --> 28:46.719
What the King wants, he will have.

28:46.927 --> 28:50.514
No, Annee. It’s quite the reverse.
What you want, you shall have.

28:50.723 --> 28:53.100
- If I have you first.
- Not against your will.

28:53.350 --> 28:55.686
- Not?
- Never.

28:56.311 --> 29:00.608
I’ll earn your love
and then your bed.

29:00.816 --> 29:04.402
Tell me what things you want.
Prove me.

29:06.029 --> 29:08.198
There is one thing I want.

29:08.406 --> 29:10.367
I want something that has gone.

29:10.576 --> 29:13.621
You shall have it.
Now walk with me, talk with me.

29:13.871 --> 29:17.708
I love your sweet voice,
your company and your bold spirit.

29:17.958 --> 29:20.377
Tell me, dare I ask it?

29:20.586 --> 29:24.006
Is there anything about me
that you love?

29:24.214 --> 29:26.383
No.

29:26.592 --> 29:27.843
My God.

29:28.093 --> 29:30.428
You asked not to be treated
like the King.

29:30.638 --> 29:33.181
I would have lied to the King.

29:33.390 --> 29:35.976
No one has ever talked to me
like that before.

29:36.226 --> 29:39.897
My sweet voice will not lie to you.

29:40.105 --> 29:43.441
But in time, Nan,
you'll grow to love me.

29:44.192 --> 29:45.653
Anything is possible.

29:45.861 --> 29:49.447
With us everything is possible.

29:59.457 --> 30:01.585
That's settled. I can return to London.

30:01.794 --> 30:04.462
- You, Cromwell, will remain here.
- Here, My Lord?

30:04.713 --> 30:07.465
To keep me informed.

30:17.976 --> 30:21.939
Tell My Lord of Suffolk that we shall
entertain no more such petitions.

30:26.569 --> 30:29.738
Show that to Sir Thomas More,
that's his province.

30:29.947 --> 30:32.240
Ah, Thomas.

30:32.449 --> 30:34.618
You smell of horse sweat.

30:34.827 --> 30:37.996
His Majesty has sent me to inform you,
My Lord, that the...

30:38.205 --> 30:42.501
...entertainment at Hever suits him
well, and he intends to remain.

30:42.710 --> 30:45.713
Excellent. No, tell Lovell
his request is denied.

30:45.921 --> 30:48.799
That witch has been leading him
a dance for two weeks.

30:49.007 --> 30:51.552
She'll go the way of all the rest.
Granted.

30:51.760 --> 30:56.306
The King should be attending to matters
of State, not pursuing a reluctant girl.

30:56.515 --> 30:58.475
If he wants her, he should take her.

30:58.684 --> 31:01.311
What is Sir Thomas More's opinion
about that?

31:01.520 --> 31:04.732
Master Cromwell,
when you counsel the King

31:04.940 --> 31:08.276
tell him what he ought to do,
but never what he is able to do.

31:08.485 --> 31:12.197
If he knew his real strength, it
would be hard for any man to rule him.

31:12.405 --> 31:17.578
- He ought to leave Hever.
- Let sleeping kings lie, Thomas,

31:17.786 --> 31:20.748
and we'll see to the government
of the country.

32:03.331 --> 32:09.505
Nan, it's a cruel thing to be
near a woman day after day,

32:09.713 --> 32:13.425
to touch her when you wanted to,
to have her company when you asked it

32:13.634 --> 32:15.343
and to have no response.

32:15.553 --> 32:17.846
To burn with love as I do for you

32:18.096 --> 32:21.308
and be denied any pleasure
in your cool company.

32:21.517 --> 32:25.563
It is a cruel thing, Nan,
to be denied love.

32:25.771 --> 32:30.483
The same cruel thing has happened to me.
I’ve fallen in love.

32:30.693 --> 32:33.361
- Nan!
- But not with you.

32:35.781 --> 32:38.951
My God. I got it right in the face
that time. Percy, is it?

32:39.159 --> 32:41.286
You know.
You had Wolsey send him away.

32:41.494 --> 32:43.747
- That blundering...
- I mean to marry him.

32:43.956 --> 32:47.375
- Never!
- But not as my sister is married.

32:47.626 --> 32:51.589
He won't be a complacent husband
and I shall not be accessible to you.

32:51.839 --> 32:55.801
All wives are accessible.
Any husband can be placated.

32:56.009 --> 32:58.679
Then you have nothing to fear.
Let me marry him.

32:58.887 --> 33:00.931
No! I want you all to myself!

33:01.139 --> 33:03.141
Nan. Nan.

33:04.392 --> 33:08.564
If you give yourself to me
this whole kingdom will turn around you.

33:08.772 --> 33:12.150
Whatever you wanted for anyone.
knighthoods, revenues,

33:12.359 --> 33:14.903
you shall dispose of them
exactly as you please.

33:15.153 --> 33:19.783
And be thrown out in the end? What great
revenues does my sister dispose of?

33:19.992 --> 33:23.996
Well, Mary asked for nothing.
I won't bargain. Ask for what you want.

33:24.162 --> 33:26.915
My freedom. To marry whom I love.

33:27.124 --> 33:28.626
Never.

33:30.210 --> 33:34.131
I’ve heard what your courtiers say
and I’ve seen what you are.

33:34.339 --> 33:37.760
You're spoiled and vengeful
and bloody.

33:37.968 --> 33:41.304
Your poetry is sour
and your music is worse.

33:41.471 --> 33:45.350
You make love as you eat, with
a good deal of noise and no subtlety.

33:45.559 --> 33:46.560
This is not safe.

33:46.810 --> 33:50.480
Yes, I’ve been told it's not safe
for any of us to say no to our King.

33:50.648 --> 33:53.901
That put on, kindly,
hail-fellow-well-met of yours.

33:54.109 --> 33:58.405
My father's house will be pulled down,
and Northumberland's too, they tell me.

33:58.614 --> 34:02.159
Well, pull them down, Your Majesty,
you are what I said.

34:02.367 --> 34:06.038
There is no better way to make an end
than to raise anger in me.

34:06.246 --> 34:11.877
I thank you for that. You made
a fool of me! And I’m well out of it!

34:14.630 --> 34:16.882
Your Grace!

34:17.090 --> 34:20.260
- You will not harm Harry Percy?
- I’ll try not.

34:20.467 --> 34:24.347
Vengeful and bloody as I am,
I’ll try not!

34:33.356 --> 34:34.315
[grunts]

34:34.567 --> 34:36.610
- Where are you from?
- Northumberland.

34:36.819 --> 34:40.447
- I’ve a message for the Lady Annee.
- You better rest. Give me the letter.

34:40.697 --> 34:43.659
- Give it to no one but the Lady Annee.
- All right.

34:57.673 --> 35:00.258
Harry Percy is married.

35:03.220 --> 35:05.764
"Annee, my love, forgive me".

35:08.517 --> 35:12.437
- The King did this.
- Not the King, Wolsey.

35:12.646 --> 35:14.481
See here.

35:14.690 --> 35:19.695
''I would have held out. But for your
safety, dearest Annee, I had to marry.''

35:19.903 --> 35:24.908
That would be Wolsey's threat, that you
would suffer if Percy remained defiant.

35:25.117 --> 35:30.956
God, I can't believe it.
The pain is so great, I want to die.

35:31.164 --> 35:36.419
Pain goes, my child.
Few of us marry where our hearts lie.

35:38.380 --> 35:40.423
[shouting, cheering]

35:51.309 --> 35:55.063
Damn all entertainment
and damn all women!

35:55.272 --> 36:01.319
Why must I want the one woman
who doesn't want me?

36:14.583 --> 36:16.209
I’ll see her!

36:32.685 --> 36:34.394
Elizabeth.

36:35.896 --> 36:40.192
For God's sake make her hurry. When the
King is hungry he's in an evil temper.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.444
I’ll see to this.

36:43.696 --> 36:48.116
Will. Let's see what the lady Elizabeth
has decided.

36:48.325 --> 36:52.580
- He's never returned to a woman.
- Lucky for all of us and your child.

36:52.788 --> 36:56.041
- Henry was generous with his children.
- Learn from me, Nan.

36:56.249 --> 36:59.211
Lock up your heart,
never surrender completely.

36:59.419 --> 37:01.755
I shall not surrender myself at all.

37:01.964 --> 37:05.342
The moment you're conquered
he'll walk away.

37:05.551 --> 37:06.885
That's enough!

37:07.094 --> 37:10.639
I hate him only a little less
than I hate Wolsey.

37:11.389 --> 37:15.644
- Ready? Are we ready?
- Quite ready, Father.

37:40.586 --> 37:47.384
* Farewell, farewell
My pleasure past

37:47.968 --> 37:54.182
* Welcome my present pain

37:54.767 --> 38:01.398
* Welcome the torment In my heart

38:01.607 --> 38:08.822
* To see my love again

38:09.406 --> 38:16.955
* Alone, alone
I longed for her

38:17.414 --> 38:24.713
* While mistresses forsaking

38:25.589 --> 38:32.763
* Now must I tell my hopes and fear

38:32.971 --> 38:42.480
* Of love In her awaking *

38:52.533 --> 38:56.411
Bravo, Your Majesty! Bravo!

39:02.167 --> 39:03.418
Bravo, Majesty.

39:03.627 --> 39:06.296
No other king can write as you do,
Your Majesty.

39:06.505 --> 39:10.258
That cheers me, Elizabeth.
Someone, I forget whom,

39:10.467 --> 39:16.389
said once that my music was sour
and my poetry worse.

39:16.640 --> 39:22.145
That caused me great anguish. True verse
and music grow from suffering.

39:22.354 --> 39:25.357
I heard it in my mind
when I woke from a troubled sleep.

39:25.566 --> 39:31.363
I wrote it down without a correction.
It sings what is truly in my heart.

39:33.156 --> 39:38.286
If some young man wrote this song
for you, Annee, what would you say of it?

39:38.495 --> 39:42.207
I would ask him how his wife liked it,
Your Grace.

39:46.211 --> 39:49.798
You shall dance to my tune, mistress.

39:51.424 --> 39:55.345
The Basse dance I composed.
Play. Be merry. Dance.

40:27.628 --> 40:31.632
Annee, why do you taunt me?

40:31.840 --> 40:34.092
Percy is married, Your Majesty.

40:34.301 --> 40:37.095
- None of my doing.
- I see.

40:37.304 --> 40:40.348
Wolsey is King of England, is he?

40:43.769 --> 40:45.979
That's enough. I am the King.

40:46.229 --> 40:49.482
If you dare to treat me like
a bawling boy in front of my court,

40:49.692 --> 40:52.277
- I’ll tear this castle down.
- Do so.

40:55.197 --> 41:00.953
Annee, even a king cAnneot choose
where he will love.

41:01.161 --> 41:06.959
I want no one in this kingdom but you.
That's why I’ve returned.

41:07.167 --> 41:09.294
You are not free to love,
you have a wife.

41:09.587 --> 41:12.380
If a man is married, king or commoner,
he is not free.

41:12.590 --> 41:15.383
I never married Catherine.
England married Spain.

41:15.593 --> 41:20.055
My father coupled my brother Arthur
with Catherine for the Spanish Alliance.

41:20.263 --> 41:25.018
Arthur died and I became heir, so it was
decided that I, in my turn, should...

41:25.227 --> 41:29.773
...marry my dead brother's widow.

41:29.982 --> 41:32.943
I was 17 and she 23.

41:33.193 --> 41:37.531
So England and Spain married,
not Henry and Catherine.

41:43.621 --> 41:49.292
There's a...
There's a curse on that marriage.

41:49.502 --> 41:52.420
All my sons were born dead.

41:52.630 --> 41:57.009
For 20 years I’ve had dead sons.

41:58.385 --> 42:03.974
Now she's past the age
of bearing children.

42:06.769 --> 42:09.688
What has this barren marriage
to do with you and me?

42:09.897 --> 42:14.276
You cAnneot touch my heart.
You cAnneot bribe me with favours.

42:14.484 --> 42:19.239
The only love I will give you is the
love of a loyal subject for her king.

42:24.745 --> 42:26.830
Very well then.

42:27.706 --> 42:29.875
As your King,

42:30.125 --> 42:34.337
I command you to return with me
to the court.

42:35.631 --> 42:39.384
I command you to be
lady-in-waiting to my wife,

42:39.593 --> 42:43.013
Catherine the Queen.

42:43.263 --> 42:47.100
You will be in my presence
every day of your life.

42:48.018 --> 42:50.395
Then we shall see.

43:14.419 --> 43:16.505
- Was he shouting for me?
- Bellowing.

43:16.714 --> 43:20.342
- How they all tremble when he bellows.
- And you?

43:21.552 --> 43:23.846
Does that tremble?

43:24.638 --> 43:28.601
No. But you so hated coming here
you spoke wildly.

43:28.809 --> 43:33.021
- I fear you might provoke his anger.
- That was six months ago.

43:33.271 --> 43:38.360
I’m still young. I love dancing
and new clothes and gifts.

43:39.069 --> 43:42.615
- And power.

43:42.823 --> 43:45.408
Power is as exciting as love,
I discover.

43:45.618 --> 43:48.787
And who has more of it than the King?

43:54.001 --> 43:56.419
The warship will be launched
from Portsmouth

43:56.670 --> 43:59.422
in five days time, Your Grace.
Here is the warrant.

43:59.673 --> 44:02.175
But a name is needed for the vessel.

44:02.384 --> 44:03.886
The "Annee Boleyn".

44:06.096 --> 44:09.600
- The ambassadors from Spain?
- Deal with them yourself.

44:13.311 --> 44:17.315
She almost reigns. She entirely rules.

44:17.525 --> 44:21.820
And I believe gives... nothing for it.

44:22.905 --> 44:26.742
- She could prove powerful.
- Thomas, this is a man's world.

44:26.950 --> 44:31.329
The seat of power does not lie
between a woman's legs.

44:31.539 --> 44:35.709
Wolsey, Nan reminds me that her
father's patent of the Earl of Wiltshire

44:35.918 --> 44:39.171
- has not yet been drawn.
- Indeed. It should be done at once.

44:39.379 --> 44:40.589
Good. Good.

44:40.798 --> 44:44.176
I must tell you, My Lord,
a game we ladies-in-waiting play.

44:44.384 --> 44:46.344
A game of titles.

44:46.554 --> 44:49.765
Who has the most titles in the land?

44:49.973 --> 44:54.812
I said that, of course, His Majesty.
But another said, "No, no".

44:55.020 --> 44:57.856
"The great Cardinal Wolsey
has more than the King".

44:58.065 --> 45:02.903
"He is Bishop of Tournai, of Lincoln, of
Bath and Wells, Durham and Winchester".

45:03.111 --> 45:06.406
"He is also Archbishop of York
and Papal Legate in England,

45:06.615 --> 45:09.409
which puts him above
the Archbishop of Canterbury".

45:09.618 --> 45:11.620
"Who knows?
He may one day be Pope".

45:11.829 --> 45:14.414
"So he is the most powerful churchman".

45:14.623 --> 45:20.796
"He is also Lord Chancellor and
therefore the most powerful layman".

45:21.088 --> 45:24.592
I said, "How fortunate for His Majesty
that the good Cardinal

45:24.800 --> 45:28.136
is devoted only to the King
and to England".

45:28.386 --> 45:32.474
"Consider how dangerous it would be
if so powerful a man

45:32.683 --> 45:36.269
had ambitions of his own".

45:37.938 --> 45:39.189
His Sovereign,

45:39.356 --> 45:43.110
I confess your royal favours
showered on me are more than I deserve.

45:44.069 --> 45:46.614
I can render nothing
but my thanks, my prayers

45:46.822 --> 45:49.282
and my unending loyalty.

45:49.533 --> 45:52.786
And what livings would you shed
to prove your loyalty,

45:52.995 --> 45:55.247
my good Vicar of Hell?

45:55.455 --> 45:58.083
Any, or all, sir, at your command.

45:58.291 --> 46:02.588
And your wealth, My Lord?
I believe he is richer even than you.

46:02.796 --> 46:06.925
- So many livings, so many palaces.
- I wonder.

46:07.134 --> 46:09.803
Such vanities mean little to me
if I may serve you.

46:10.012 --> 46:12.931
Choose anything I have
and it is yours, Majesty.

46:13.181 --> 46:16.476
I will. I will.

46:16.685 --> 46:19.479
When I have given it some thought.

46:19.688 --> 46:22.816
Thank you. Thank you, Annee.

46:25.110 --> 46:28.071
My Lord, you are as generous
as you are great.

46:28.238 --> 46:32.409
I shall ask the King to show me
your palace at Hampton Court.

46:32.618 --> 46:34.870
Bull's-eye.

47:13.116 --> 47:16.579
Come, girl, play something cheerful.

47:16.787 --> 47:21.208
Men prefer women who laugh and are gay.

47:25.671 --> 47:29.174
Well, what more do you want?

47:29.382 --> 47:32.302
- Nothing.
- For yourself, your family and friends?

47:32.553 --> 47:34.137
- Nothing.
- Liar!

47:34.346 --> 47:38.225
You have a taste for power. It’s very
common. I’ve seen it many times.

47:38.433 --> 47:40.853
You don't get it for nothing.
You have to pay.

47:41.061 --> 47:45.941
You ordered me to court.
The power is yours, not mine.

47:46.149 --> 47:50.362
I’m mad for you. I dream of you
at night. I long for you by day.

47:50.571 --> 47:52.823
And you dare tell me
that I have the power?

47:53.031 --> 47:56.451
I’m no good with any other woman.
I think of nothing but you,

47:56.660 --> 47:59.538
of you and me playing dog and bitch,
horse and mare,

47:59.747 --> 48:01.874
of you and me in every way.

48:02.124 --> 48:07.170
I want to fill you up night after night.
I want to fill you up with sons.

48:07.379 --> 48:12.425
Bastards. They would be bastards.

48:13.719 --> 48:18.181
One word more and I’ll strike you.
One word more.

48:21.685 --> 48:26.231
Without marriage, if you and I
have sons, they will be bastards.

48:30.903 --> 48:32.530
Annee.

48:33.822 --> 48:37.325
Forgive me. Forgive me, Annee.

48:45.458 --> 48:48.461
- Who is it?
- Norfolk, with a message from the King.

48:48.671 --> 48:51.006
The devil take him.

48:51.214 --> 48:52.966
Bess.

48:53.592 --> 48:56.762
- Bess, be gone. Come on.

48:56.970 --> 48:59.472
- Out you go, out you go.
- What?

48:59.682 --> 49:01.725
For form's sake.

49:01.934 --> 49:04.562
- Come on, come on.

49:13.612 --> 49:15.823
Enter.

49:21.579 --> 49:22.580
Well?

49:22.788 --> 49:26.333
The King commands that you
come at once to the Palace at Greenwich.

49:26.584 --> 49:28.168
Does he, My Lord?

49:28.376 --> 49:32.089
Is he ill?
Is there some urgent danger?

49:32.297 --> 49:34.382
A boat is waiting.

49:36.176 --> 49:38.011
Norfolk!

49:39.888 --> 49:42.057
Is the tide with or against us?

49:42.265 --> 49:45.936
I leave such details to the boatman
and other riffraff, My Lord.

49:46.770 --> 49:49.439
You may go.

49:59.533 --> 50:01.326
Enter.

50:03.328 --> 50:05.873
What keeps you half the night
from getting here?

50:06.123 --> 50:08.584
Your Grace, pardon me.
Tide is flooding.

50:08.792 --> 50:12.129
Tell the Lady Annee the law of England,
My Holy Lord Chancellor.

50:12.379 --> 50:16.216
Is it not true that I can make
legitimate whomsoever I choose?

50:16.466 --> 50:19.637
- Most certainly.
- The documents can be drawn at once?

50:19.845 --> 50:22.806
- Within the hour.
- So?

50:23.015 --> 50:26.226
Could any child of the King's body
be made legitimate?

50:26.434 --> 50:28.270
Yes.

50:28.478 --> 50:31.398
And such a child would be heir
to the throne of England?

50:31.649 --> 50:34.276
- Most certainly.
- Thank you. Thank you, Thomas.

50:34.484 --> 50:37.320
- Take the flooding tide and go home.
- Wait.

50:37.530 --> 50:38.531
Madam?

50:38.739 --> 50:44.745
Surely such a child would be heir
to the throne after the Princess Mary,

50:44.953 --> 50:48.832
daughter of the King
and his rightful Queen?

50:49.082 --> 50:51.669
- Well, My Lord?
- That might be argued.

50:51.877 --> 50:55.463
No. Let us have it clearly.

50:56.965 --> 50:59.009
Princess Mary is first in line

50:59.259 --> 51:03.346
against any son His Majesty
may father out of wedlock.

51:03.889 --> 51:10.938
After Mary comes the Duke of Richmond,
his bastard by Bessie Blount.

51:12.272 --> 51:14.733
Can you deny that he would inherit
if she died?

51:14.942 --> 51:19.279
Richmond? Oh, he's a sickly fellow.
I doubt if he'll live out the year.

51:19.530 --> 51:23.450
Then my sister's child by the King.

51:23.701 --> 51:27.705
We're affectionate, Mary and I,
and forgive each other little things,

51:27.913 --> 51:31.667
but if she would rather her son
sat on the throne than mine,

51:31.917 --> 51:34.336
I would rather mine than hers.

51:34.545 --> 51:39.216
And so mine, you must agree,
would be fourth in the lists.

51:39.424 --> 51:42.469
Who knows, madam,
you may not be capable of a son.

51:42.678 --> 51:45.764
I’ll give the man that marries me
a houseful of lusty sons.

51:48.266 --> 51:51.144
Marriage.

51:51.353 --> 51:53.480
If I were free of Catherine...

51:54.815 --> 51:56.859
You cAnneot be free of Catherine.

51:57.568 --> 52:00.487
- If I were...
- It is impossible.

52:00.696 --> 52:03.073
For the last time,
if I were free of Catherine

52:03.323 --> 52:06.827
and made you the Queen of England,
would you marry me?

52:09.162 --> 52:10.956
Yes.

52:11.164 --> 52:15.043
If you make me Queen of England,
I’ll marry you...

52:15.252 --> 52:18.213
...and give you sons.

52:19.172 --> 52:21.091
Meanwhile...

52:27.640 --> 52:32.603
I’ll go alone to my bed,
with Your Gracious leave.

52:37.525 --> 52:40.318
- Brilliant, Your Grace. Brilliant.
- You think so?

52:40.528 --> 52:44.907
Yes. Keep promising her marriage
and the siege will soon be over.

52:45.115 --> 52:48.536
- In a month you'll have breached her.
- You think I was lying?

52:48.744 --> 52:52.455
If wooing, praise,
gifts and power have failed

52:52.665 --> 52:55.834
then you must try a new strategy.

52:56.919 --> 53:02.841
When I go down on my hunkers and pray,
good Cardinal, as I do day in, day out,

53:03.050 --> 53:05.969
there's only one thing I pray.

53:06.178 --> 53:11.600
Show me how to save England
from chaos when I’m dead.

53:11.809 --> 53:17.815
That prayer has just been answered.
I shall remarry and have a son.

53:18.023 --> 53:22.152
- Divorce? Catherine?
- Anneulment.

53:22.360 --> 53:25.405
My marriage is cursed
and my sons born dead

53:25.614 --> 53:29.326
because I’ve transgressed God's Law
in marrying my brother's wife.

53:29.535 --> 53:33.581
It was incest and I’ve been punished.
I was never married in the eyes of God.

53:33.789 --> 53:36.667
Indeed you were, My Lord.
Thoroughly married.

53:36.875 --> 53:40.796
The Pope granted you a dispensation
to marry Catherine when Arthur died.

53:41.004 --> 53:43.591
Because England and Spain
needed one another.

53:43.799 --> 53:47.385
Because your brother was 15
and had not consummated the marriage.

53:47.595 --> 53:50.388
At 15, I was rogering maids
right, left and centre.

53:50.598 --> 53:54.685
At the time I believed, and the Pope
believed, and my father chose to believe

53:54.893 --> 53:56.937
that Catherine was virgin.

53:57.145 --> 54:00.858
I was deceived.
The marriage was consummated.

54:01.066 --> 54:03.861
Prepare the evidence.
Get me a case for Anneulment.

54:04.069 --> 54:09.617
My Lord, I beg you, as your faithful
servant, I beg you to consider.

54:09.825 --> 54:11.744
Catherine is a princess of Spain.

54:11.952 --> 54:15.998
Try to Anneul your marriage and you'll
gather enormous forces against you.

54:16.206 --> 54:21.044
Spain, Naples, Germany, the Netherlands.
All of them ruled by Catherine's nephew.

54:21.253 --> 54:23.130
The Roman Catholic Church.

54:23.338 --> 54:27.009
- Your own people who love the Queen.
- I will marry Annee!

54:27.217 --> 54:30.262
It could mean war.
It could mean the loss of your kingdom.

54:30.470 --> 54:32.848
I will marry Annee
if it breaks the Earth in two

54:33.098 --> 54:35.684
and flings the two halves into the void!

54:46.028 --> 54:48.906
No. I don't believe it of him.

54:49.114 --> 54:50.699
I fear it is true, madam.

54:50.908 --> 54:56.079
As Spanish Ambassador, it is my duty
to have... many sources of information.

55:02.586 --> 55:05.422
Then it is Wolsey, not the King.

55:05.631 --> 55:09.217
That butcher's cur, Wolsey,
who put it in his mind.

55:09.426 --> 55:12.220
Wolsey is preparing the case
to take to Rome.

55:16.183 --> 55:17.935
Enter.

55:18.143 --> 55:20.979
The King is here.
He wishes to see Your Majesty.

55:21.188 --> 55:25.526
I will do all in my power to aid you.
I will send word today to your nephew.

55:25.734 --> 55:29.029
- Yes and to His Holiness.
- This Pope bends to the wind.

55:29.237 --> 55:31.990
Your hope lies in your nephew.

55:32.199 --> 55:36.036
- Your Majesty.
- My Lord Ambassador.

55:55.848 --> 56:00.978
It delights my heart to see you
privately after so many months, My Lord.

56:02.563 --> 56:05.315
Sit, Kate. Sit.

56:11.780 --> 56:13.156
Kate,

56:14.742 --> 56:18.245
I’ll come bluntly to the point.

56:18.453 --> 56:24.502
God tells me that our marriage is a sin.
My conscience is deeply troubled.

56:26.169 --> 56:31.216
Incest will be punished and we
have been punished with dead sons.

56:31.424 --> 56:34.928
Our daughter, Mary,
is alive and well, Henry.

56:35.178 --> 56:37.806
Our marriage must be Anneulled.

56:38.015 --> 56:42.936
Then it is true.
Wolsey has brought you to this.

56:45.564 --> 56:47.149
Kate.

56:48.150 --> 56:52.738
- Kate, it's God's will.
- My conscience is clear.

56:53.864 --> 56:59.703
Help me, for both our sakes.
Support me in my case to the Pope.

57:00.495 --> 57:02.080
But I’m your wife.

57:02.289 --> 57:06.960
Do you believe I can ask Pope Clement
to tell the world that my father lied?

57:07.169 --> 57:08.879
My mother lied?

57:09.087 --> 57:12.090
Ferdinand and Isabella,
the most christian princes,

57:12.299 --> 57:16.554
that each of them lied that my marriage
to your brother was never consummated?

57:16.762 --> 57:19.181
Your own father signed the paper
with them.

57:19.389 --> 57:23.644
God knows he lied like a Trojan,
in season and out.

57:24.603 --> 57:27.147
I’ve had little happiness in my life.

57:27.355 --> 57:28.732
I was a lonely girl,

57:28.941 --> 57:33.486
brought from Spain at 15
to be used for English politics.

57:33.696 --> 57:38.158
When Arthur died I was pushed aside
and kept here for seven years

57:38.366 --> 57:40.953
until I could be used for you.

57:41.161 --> 57:43.914
And you, I loved.

57:44.122 --> 57:47.668
With you I had my only happiness.

57:48.168 --> 57:51.088
I love you still.

57:51.296 --> 57:53.507
Then do as I ask!

57:58.261 --> 58:02.265
No. I will not betray our daughter.

58:04.392 --> 58:08.146
Our daughter is a threat,

58:08.355 --> 58:10.357
not a blessing.

58:11.817 --> 58:13.777
I must...

58:14.277 --> 58:15.904
I must have a son!

58:16.154 --> 58:18.699
Get one then,
from one of your women!

58:18.907 --> 58:20.492
I’m your wife and your Queen.

58:20.701 --> 58:25.413
And neither your nor the Pope
can make my child a bastard!

58:26.123 --> 58:30.335
If you defy me,
I’ll have you sent from the court.

58:30.544 --> 58:33.213
You shall be shut away in the country.

58:35.799 --> 58:40.721
It’s you then, and not Wolsey,
who really wants this thing.

58:41.722 --> 58:44.099
I will have it!

58:44.808 --> 58:49.522
I too gave evidence that my marriage
to Arthur was never consummated.

58:49.772 --> 58:53.316
Did I lie to the Pope
all those years ago?

58:53.526 --> 58:55.944
Did I lie to God?

58:56.153 --> 58:59.364
Did I lie to you?

59:02.034 --> 59:03.493
No.

59:04.452 --> 59:07.790
I will live and I will die your wife.

59:08.582 --> 59:10.000
And your Queen.

59:58.674 --> 01:00:03.053
As soon as I reach Rome, I shall
send dispatches back via Holland.

01:00:03.261 --> 01:00:05.973
See that messengers are there.

01:00:27.745 --> 01:00:29.705
Not long.

01:00:29.913 --> 01:00:32.541
Not long to wait now, Nan.

01:00:33.291 --> 01:00:37.212
I shall believe it
on the day it happens.

01:01:29.682 --> 01:01:31.725
Your Grace.

01:01:39.983 --> 01:01:41.401
Yes?

01:01:41.902 --> 01:01:46.281
The Spanish Emperor
has captured the Vatican.

01:01:46.489 --> 01:01:49.577
- Captured the Vatican?
- Rome is sacked.

01:01:49.827 --> 01:01:54.582
The dead in their hundreds
lie unburied in the streets.

01:01:55.332 --> 01:01:58.293
- And the Pope?
- Is besieged.

01:01:58.502 --> 01:01:59.503
What...?

01:01:59.712 --> 01:02:03.006
By your gracious permission,
in private.

01:02:03.256 --> 01:02:05.509
[courtiers gasp and mutter]

01:02:12.182 --> 01:02:13.391
Well?

01:02:13.601 --> 01:02:17.270
The Pope had fled from the Vatican
to the town of Orvieto.

01:02:17.521 --> 01:02:20.148
- We exchanged letters.
- Yes and the Anneulment?

01:02:20.315 --> 01:02:23.068
- He refuses to Anneul your marriage.
- He cAnneot!

01:02:23.276 --> 01:02:25.946
- He cAnneot do anything else.
- What's his reason?

01:02:26.154 --> 01:02:28.616
The Spanish Emperor's
got him by the nose.

01:02:28.824 --> 01:02:33.537
The Pope won't offend that Emperor
by Anneulling his aunt's marriage to you.

01:02:35.539 --> 01:02:38.083
Poor Henry.

01:02:38.917 --> 01:02:43.881
He shall, by God Almighty.
I say he shall!

01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:47.134
And to hell with the Spanish Emperor.

01:03:23.879 --> 01:03:27.633
- Sir Thomas.
- My Lord Bishop.

01:03:27.841 --> 01:03:30.969
Shall you in your conscience
accept the Anneulment

01:03:31.178 --> 01:03:33.388
if the decision is for the King?

01:03:33.681 --> 01:03:36.016
The Pope has answered the King's appeal

01:03:36.224 --> 01:03:40.145
and has sent Cardinal Campeggio
to try this case.

01:03:40.353 --> 01:03:44.399
Campeggio speaks for His Holiness.
I will accept that.

01:03:44.608 --> 01:03:48.278
I shall speak against it
while I have breath.

01:03:48.486 --> 01:03:51.740
I shall be silent
until I am forced to speak.

01:03:53.867 --> 01:03:57.913
Well, I’m an old man and have no family.

01:03:58.163 --> 01:04:01.124
At my age a good death is better
than a bad conscience.

01:04:01.374 --> 01:04:04.377
Well, you will be the mother and father

01:04:04.587 --> 01:04:08.090
and I shall be the uncle
of a queen next week.

01:04:08.298 --> 01:04:12.219
- God be praised.
- I wonder what Annee is thinking.

01:04:12.469 --> 01:04:16.014
Out there are my bishops,
my courtiers and my loyal subjects.

01:04:16.223 --> 01:04:18.266
Campeggio is not your subject.

01:04:18.433 --> 01:04:20.978
But I am, Your Majesty.

01:04:21.186 --> 01:04:24.356
And I promise you the verdict.

01:04:29.152 --> 01:04:33.657
You shall see, Annee.
Wolsey has never failed me yet.

01:04:33.907 --> 01:04:38.078
Pray silence for His Grace,
the Lord Cardinal of York.

01:04:38.286 --> 01:04:41.414
Our commission from Rome
having been publicly read,

01:04:41.624 --> 01:04:44.918
this inquiry will now proceed.

01:04:45.168 --> 01:04:49.757
Henry, King of England,
come into court.

01:05:16.033 --> 01:05:18.201
Here, my lords.

01:05:21.371 --> 01:05:24.625
Catherine, Queen of England,
come into court.

01:05:32.215 --> 01:05:33.551
On. On.

01:05:33.759 --> 01:05:35.969
What can I do
if the Queen will not appear?

01:05:36.178 --> 01:05:40.057
- My Lord Cardinal.
- Ecco.

01:05:41.183 --> 01:05:44.102
The King may now proceed.

01:05:53.028 --> 01:05:58.366
My Lords, I have come to this court
not because I wish to discard a wife,

01:05:58.576 --> 01:06:01.579
but because such grave doubts
are cast upon my marriage

01:06:01.787 --> 01:06:05.290
and such grave fears
invest my conscience.

01:06:06.499 --> 01:06:11.922
I do not wish to marry another woman
for carnal pleasure,

01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:16.426
or nor for any displeasure
of the Queen's person or age.

01:06:16.677 --> 01:06:21.807
This court has been convened
to try the validity of that marriage.

01:06:22.015 --> 01:06:25.102
The bishops assembled here
have signed this document

01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:29.982
declaring that the marriage is in doubt
and must be resolved by trial.

01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:32.860
That is the truth,
if it please Your Highness.

01:06:33.068 --> 01:06:36.572
No, Sir, that is not the truth.

01:06:37.865 --> 01:06:40.826
- I do not give my consent.
- Wolsey.

01:06:40.993 --> 01:06:45.288
Your memory is failing with age, Bishop.

01:06:45.497 --> 01:06:48.083
We argued and in the end you agreed

01:06:48.333 --> 01:06:51.419
that I should sign for you
and affix your seal.

01:06:51.629 --> 01:06:54.715
My Lord, there is nothing more untrue.

01:06:54.923 --> 01:06:57.510
I told you I would never
support this cause.

01:06:58.468 --> 01:07:03.181
- Well, well, you're only one man.

01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:04.683
Continue.

01:07:04.892 --> 01:07:07.477
Hear the witnesses
who spoke with my brother

01:07:07.728 --> 01:07:10.230
the morning after
he left the bedchamber.

01:07:10.438 --> 01:07:15.193
Are we to have no evidence
but bedroom sniggering and gossip?

01:07:15.402 --> 01:07:17.863
Get a message to the Queen.
She should be here.

01:07:18.071 --> 01:07:20.115
She'll let her case go by default.

01:07:35.338 --> 01:07:37.257
I will hear the Queen.

01:07:40.678 --> 01:07:44.640
I will only be heard in Rome.
I appeal to Rome.

01:07:44.848 --> 01:07:47.434
I appeal against all judges here.

01:07:47.643 --> 01:07:51.730
To Rome and to God I commit my cause.

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.782
Catherine.

01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:03.742
Catherine!

01:08:08.872 --> 01:08:10.583
Proceed.

01:08:11.416 --> 01:08:15.253
- I am going to adjourn.
- No, I beseech you, do not.

01:08:16.714 --> 01:08:19.591
I adjourn this court.

01:08:35.816 --> 01:08:39.612
- You have the power. Use it.
- Power to hear the case, Your Majesty.

01:08:39.819 --> 01:08:43.532
- But you've heard it, hours of it.
- From Your Majesty's witnesses.

01:08:43.741 --> 01:08:46.868
The Queen says no court in England
can be impartial.

01:08:47.077 --> 01:08:49.037
She appeals directly to Rome.

01:08:49.246 --> 01:08:51.456
But you are Rome come to England,
My Lord.

01:08:51.665 --> 01:08:55.711
My hands are tied. The trial is
adjourned for the Queen's appeal.

01:08:55.919 --> 01:09:00.508
To the Pope who fears the Queen's nephew
more than he loves the justice of God.

01:09:00.758 --> 01:09:03.301
- Your Grace could be excommunicated!
- Get out!

01:09:03.551 --> 01:09:05.386
Limp back to Rome.

01:09:05.595 --> 01:09:09.933
Tell His Holiness I will have
the marriage Anneulled. Get out, get out.

01:09:12.102 --> 01:09:13.729
Get out!

01:09:22.738 --> 01:09:27.033
Well, My Lord Cardinal,
so much for your boastful promises.

01:09:41.799 --> 01:09:45.385
Your Grace, forgive me.

01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:50.182
Forgive me.

01:09:52.017 --> 01:09:56.689
Go to the Queen.
Banish her from the court

01:09:56.897 --> 01:09:59.900
and house her at your own expense
in some remote place.

01:10:00.108 --> 01:10:02.110
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:10:03.445 --> 01:10:04.613
Wolsey.

01:10:06.657 --> 01:10:11.537
Remove yourself from my sight.
You're unfit for office.

01:10:12.412 --> 01:10:15.082
Render up the Great Seal.

01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:19.377
And hide, Wolsey.
Hide from my anger.

01:10:23.423 --> 01:10:25.801
Go now. Go.

01:10:37.437 --> 01:10:39.147
Wolsey.

01:10:40.899 --> 01:10:45.487
I do not forgive you.
I spare you for your past services.

01:11:05.257 --> 01:11:08.301
The business of the day is over, lawyer.

01:11:08.511 --> 01:11:11.764
- I am a lawyer who has read the law.
- So?

01:11:12.014 --> 01:11:14.725
There is a law of this land
that says it is treason

01:11:14.975 --> 01:11:18.311
to acknowledge any higher authority
than the will of the King.

01:11:18.521 --> 01:11:20.939
It is, I take it, the will of the King

01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:25.443
that he shall divorce the Queen
and marry the Lady Annee?

01:11:25.653 --> 01:11:26.904
It is.

01:11:27.112 --> 01:11:31.033
Then the Church in England
must grant your will.

01:11:31.199 --> 01:11:36.539
It is treasonable to say that the Pope
is a higher authority than the King...

01:11:36.747 --> 01:11:38.999
...under the law.

01:11:41.168 --> 01:11:45.881
I’ve always been a defender
of the faith and of the Church.

01:11:46.924 --> 01:11:50.886
As matters stand,
you are but half the King.

01:11:51.094 --> 01:11:53.221
To say that Rome may dictate this matter

01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:56.975
is to say that Rome may dictate
the succession to the Crown.

01:11:57.184 --> 01:12:00.896
What the King of England wants,
he should have

01:12:01.104 --> 01:12:03.148
without hindrance from abroad.

01:12:03.356 --> 01:12:06.401
True. It is true.

01:12:08.445 --> 01:12:12.783
It would mean excommunication.

01:12:13.366 --> 01:12:15.410
It would mean a break with Rome.

01:12:15.619 --> 01:12:20.040
It would need only the appointment of a
new Primate of the Church in England.

01:12:20.290 --> 01:12:22.334
He would grant the divorce.

01:12:22.543 --> 01:12:27.881
Yes. And the penalty for those good men
who could not stomach your law?

01:12:28.090 --> 01:12:32.928
The penalty for treason
has always been death, Your Grace.

01:12:35.347 --> 01:12:37.349
You may go.

01:12:48.485 --> 01:12:51.196
There is something else, Your Majesty.

01:12:51.404 --> 01:12:54.407
Cardinal Wolsey,
through skilful manipulation,

01:12:54.617 --> 01:12:57.077
has seen to it
that the monasteries of England

01:12:57.285 --> 01:13:00.497
are richer than the goldmines
of the New World.

01:13:00.706 --> 01:13:07.087
If, as you should be, you become Head
of the Church, those riches are yours.

01:13:07.295 --> 01:13:09.632
You're a man without scruple, lawyer.

01:13:10.799 --> 01:13:13.218
Entirely without scruple.

01:13:13.426 --> 01:13:18.265
I learned my trade under
Cardinal Wolsey, Your Grace.

01:13:28.441 --> 01:13:30.653
Are you also a pupil of the Cardinal?

01:13:30.861 --> 01:13:33.614
No, no, I studied under a real master,
my father.

01:13:33.822 --> 01:13:37.409
Whatever villainy was lacking
in the world when Henry VII was born,

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:39.369
he invented before he left it.

01:13:39.578 --> 01:13:43.331
But the one cardinal principle
he taught me was,

01:13:43.541 --> 01:13:46.418
always keep the Church on your side.

01:13:46.627 --> 01:13:50.881
Well, you have the Church on one side
and you have me on the other.

01:13:51.423 --> 01:13:55.636
Yes. The choice is now clear.

01:13:57.054 --> 01:14:02.100
If I make myself Head of the Church
in England, I make you my Queen,

01:14:02.309 --> 01:14:07.314
I make myself wealthier
than all the monarchs in Europe

01:14:08.231 --> 01:14:13.236
and I shall be excommunicated.

01:14:14.279 --> 01:14:17.240
Everlasting damnation.

01:14:17.449 --> 01:14:23.664
No child of the Church shall
speak with me, feed me, shelter me.

01:14:23.872 --> 01:14:28.460
And when dead,
my body shall lie without burial

01:14:28.961 --> 01:14:31.797
and my soul...

01:14:32.005 --> 01:14:35.718
...shall be cast into hell forever.

01:14:56.655 --> 01:14:59.366
Heavenly Father,

01:14:59.575 --> 01:15:03.954
what I seek is not for myself
as You know,

01:15:04.162 --> 01:15:10.293
but for the future safety of my realm
and the greater glory of Your name.

01:15:11.962 --> 01:15:18.426
If I weaken in my resolve,
remember I am but a man.

01:15:23.932 --> 01:15:28.854
Give me Your heavenly strength
for my intended journey

01:15:30.063 --> 01:15:32.650
and resolve my doubts.

01:16:03.681 --> 01:16:05.057
My Lords,

01:16:06.224 --> 01:16:10.688
I intend to bring before Parliament
matters which have concerned us greatly.

01:16:10.896 --> 01:16:16.193
I am deeply alarmed by the increasing
influence and power in our State

01:16:16.401 --> 01:16:18.904
of the Church of Rome.

01:16:19.112 --> 01:16:22.616
Not content alone with misappropriation
of property and money,

01:16:22.825 --> 01:16:26.494
Rome now seeks to interfere with
the laws and statutes of this realm.

01:16:26.745 --> 01:16:31.208
In particular, the King's prerogatives
related to the succession to the throne.

01:16:31.416 --> 01:16:34.294
For all these reasons
and many others known to you all

01:16:34.503 --> 01:16:37.631
we must free ourselves
from the interference, influence

01:16:37.881 --> 01:16:40.968
and direction of the See of Rome.

01:16:41.176 --> 01:16:43.220
Hear, hear!

01:16:43.428 --> 01:16:47.140
Item. The Oath of Allegiance
to the King of England sworn by you all.

01:16:47.349 --> 01:16:51.478
Item. The Oath of Allegiance
to the Pope of Rome sworn by the Clergy.

01:16:51.687 --> 01:16:56.525
Question. Whom do the Clergy serve?
Pope or King?

01:16:56.734 --> 01:17:01.029
Cardinal Wolsey, the greatest Churchman
of our land is cast down.

01:17:01.279 --> 01:17:06.493
Any bishop or priest who does not
first serve the King will follow him.

01:17:09.246 --> 01:17:12.415
Parliament will be summoned
for the enactment of this bill

01:17:12.625 --> 01:17:14.126
named The Act of Supremacy.

01:17:14.334 --> 01:17:18.380
The King is declared to be supreme
in matters of the welfare of subjects,

01:17:18.589 --> 01:17:20.465
both spiritual and temporal.

01:17:20.716 --> 01:17:23.802
- Sire...
- My Lord Bishop, keep silent!

01:17:24.011 --> 01:17:26.889
There is only one question
I will put to this Council.

01:17:27.097 --> 01:17:29.725
No other will be tolerated or discussed.

01:17:29.933 --> 01:17:32.603
Does any Lord here,
either spiritual or temporal,

01:17:32.853 --> 01:17:36.398
deny the right of Parliament
to make this the law of the land

01:17:36.607 --> 01:17:39.276
if Parliament so chooses?
Sir Thomas More?

01:17:39.484 --> 01:17:42.821
I do not deny the right of Parliament
to enact laws.

01:17:43.071 --> 01:17:45.658
Good. Good.

01:18:05.594 --> 01:18:09.515
- Master Cromwell.
- My Lord Chancellor?

01:18:09.723 --> 01:18:13.644
I regret, Master Cromwell,
that you did not heed my advice.

01:18:13.852 --> 01:18:15.437
Concerning what?

01:18:15.688 --> 01:18:20.025
You have, I believe, told the King not
what he ought to do, but what he can do.

01:18:20.233 --> 01:18:22.820
Now no man in the world
can hold him.

01:18:23.028 --> 01:18:25.238
The King's power must be complete.

01:18:26.782 --> 01:18:29.492
And your own?

01:18:29.993 --> 01:18:32.329
To serve his.

01:18:32.538 --> 01:18:37.334
After today, I fear I must resign mine.

01:18:37.543 --> 01:18:40.546
Every man to the devil his own way.

01:19:02.484 --> 01:19:06.446
Forgive me, Your Majesty,
I had meant to be gone.

01:19:10.576 --> 01:19:13.161
I fear I cAnneot rise.

01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:16.665
Cromwell, your hand.
Get me on my feet.

01:19:24.548 --> 01:19:31.179
It’s the habit of a lifetime to see
myself that the inventory is complete

01:19:31.388 --> 01:19:37.102
and the keys are all ready,
all labelled for you.

01:19:37.477 --> 01:19:41.690
I’m...
I’m sorry to see you ill.

01:19:41.899 --> 01:19:44.985
Oh, no, My Lord.

01:19:45.193 --> 01:19:49.823
Your Majesty has taken from my shoulders
a load that would sink a navy.

01:19:54.327 --> 01:19:57.414
Well, I’ll leave these and be gone.

01:19:57.623 --> 01:20:04.547
Is it... Is it for you, Mistress Annee,
the palace?

01:20:04.755 --> 01:20:06.298
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.

01:20:06.464 --> 01:20:09.843
It’s much too beautiful for an old man.
It needs youth in it.

01:20:10.052 --> 01:20:12.304
There, take it.

01:20:14.807 --> 01:20:18.435
I’ve been your enemy,
but I can't take it from you.

01:20:18.644 --> 01:20:20.938
Then I’ll leave it.

01:20:27.653 --> 01:20:31.865
A leggy girl and a half-grown steer.

01:20:32.115 --> 01:20:34.159
What does that mean?

01:20:34.367 --> 01:20:37.538
Some friends of yours
are waiting to see you, Your Majesty.

01:20:37.746 --> 01:20:40.583
More, Fisher and Prior Houghton.
It seemed urgent.

01:20:40.791 --> 01:20:43.669
Urgent for them.
Send them in.

01:20:45.838 --> 01:20:47.923
I’ll tell them as I leave.

01:20:54.429 --> 01:20:57.265
Well, the country air
will do him good at Esher.

01:20:58.976 --> 01:21:01.520
The King will see you.

01:21:07.735 --> 01:21:09.737
Take heed, Sir Thomas.

01:21:09.945 --> 01:21:13.616
The King's passion for the lady
is blind to all reason

01:21:13.866 --> 01:21:16.577
and past service.

01:21:16.785 --> 01:21:20.956
My Lord, for your wisdom,
I am sorry to see you go.

01:21:25.085 --> 01:21:27.880
The King has gone beyond me.

01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:31.424
Through that one woman,

01:21:31.634 --> 01:21:34.427
I am lost forever.

01:21:34.637 --> 01:21:39.266
Do not neglect the King,
but see to your own safety.

01:21:40.308 --> 01:21:42.728
It happens
that I have been unwell lately.

01:21:42.936 --> 01:21:47.065
Therefore I have given up my office
and shall leave the court and go home.

01:21:47.274 --> 01:21:51.695
There I will speak of nothing
but... domestic affairs.

01:21:51.904 --> 01:21:55.616
Well, God be with you.

01:22:34.404 --> 01:22:36.657
It is Pope or King,
there is no other choice.

01:22:36.865 --> 01:22:38.909
For me it must be the Pope.

01:22:40.202 --> 01:22:44.832
I must follow my conscience.
I cAnneot sign.

01:22:46.249 --> 01:22:50.087
Though I am sorry to lose old friends,

01:22:50.295 --> 01:22:53.006
you will die for it.

01:22:53.215 --> 01:22:58.345
There are hundreds of my Order who in
good conscience cAnneot take this oath.

01:22:58.596 --> 01:23:00.180
Must they all die?

01:23:00.388 --> 01:23:03.934
If they insist, they will.
My cause is just.

01:23:04.142 --> 01:23:07.312
The English Church cut off from Rome
is without an anchor.

01:23:07.521 --> 01:23:11.108
The only anchor I know is the King.

01:23:11.942 --> 01:23:15.487
The King had to choose,
so must the Clergy.

01:23:28.333 --> 01:23:29.668
Well, Sir Thomas?

01:23:29.877 --> 01:23:32.004
I have come to say goodbye, Your Grace.

01:23:32.254 --> 01:23:35.423
I gave up my chain of office today
as you kindly permitted.

01:23:37.092 --> 01:23:41.514
And when that day comes when you
have to choose, will you sign the oath?

01:23:41.722 --> 01:23:43.807
I shall read the document with care

01:23:44.016 --> 01:23:47.394
and hope that my conscience
will permit me to sign, Your Grace.

01:23:54.317 --> 01:23:57.487
Goodbye... Thomas.

01:24:03.035 --> 01:24:04.912
Goodbye, My Lord.

01:24:05.871 --> 01:24:08.415
Goodbye, Prior John.

01:24:08.624 --> 01:24:14.337
You leave this world of your own will...
and I am sad for it.

01:24:14.547 --> 01:24:19.051
Your Majesty, it will go on without us.

01:24:34.775 --> 01:24:39.029
And that is the last of them
who dare question.

01:24:40.989 --> 01:24:44.159
The rest will die silent.

01:25:03.637 --> 01:25:07.099
I think there has never been a king
who gave so much to find his way

01:25:07.307 --> 01:25:09.768
to the heart of the woman he loved.

01:25:09.977 --> 01:25:14.607
I have stabbed, fought and clawed my way
through tissues of the Church and State.

01:25:14.815 --> 01:25:20.445
I’ve looted and plundered. I’ve ripped
and torn the bodies of my friends.

01:25:21.404 --> 01:25:24.241
And all to come to this day.

01:25:25.701 --> 01:25:27.745
And yet, not once...

01:25:29.246 --> 01:25:34.084
Not once have you said, "I love you".

01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:39.006
Now, my Nan...

01:25:39.214 --> 01:25:41.592
My Nan will say it now.

01:25:44.094 --> 01:25:45.929
Yes.

01:25:46.138 --> 01:25:48.473
I do love you.

01:25:49.850 --> 01:25:51.602
No.

01:25:52.895 --> 01:25:57.065
No, that's not it.
That's not what I meant.

01:25:57.274 --> 01:25:59.860
- What more do you want, My Lord?
- I don't know.

01:26:00.068 --> 01:26:02.320
I don't know,
but I still don't have you.

01:26:03.196 --> 01:26:06.784
Tell me, Nan,
did someone some day say to you,

01:26:06.992 --> 01:26:09.537
never give in to him,
never melt to him,

01:26:09.745 --> 01:26:13.498
never forget to hate him for a time,
otherwise you'll lose him?

01:26:13.707 --> 01:26:18.253
- I’ve said it to myself.
- And do you say so still?

01:26:19.046 --> 01:26:22.465
- Yes.
- I see.

01:26:24.426 --> 01:26:26.136
I see.

01:26:29.056 --> 01:26:33.644
Keep your heart, then!
Preserve your special chastity.

01:26:33.852 --> 01:26:39.191
I’m too old to suffer the longings,
passions and frenzy of a stupid boy!

01:26:39.399 --> 01:26:42.861
Writing poems in the night
to the cold-hearted bitch that I love

01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:44.655
and tearing them up.

01:26:44.863 --> 01:26:48.200
Pacing up and down in my room,
unable to sleep.

01:26:50.410 --> 01:26:55.040
Sons you have promised me when
you are Queen, and sons I will have.

01:26:55.624 --> 01:26:57.626
Sons without love if I must.

01:26:58.418 --> 01:27:01.755
Enjoy your palace.

01:27:03.924 --> 01:27:08.345
I will not come near you again
until the marriage day.

01:27:10.681 --> 01:27:12.600
Henry!

01:27:14.309 --> 01:27:16.269
I do love you.

01:27:16.895 --> 01:27:21.567
Henry, I love you. I love you
with all my heart. I love you.

01:27:24.111 --> 01:27:26.739
- Can this be true?
- I love you.

01:27:26.947 --> 01:27:31.243
Take me, take me now.
I want to be yours only.

01:27:31.451 --> 01:27:34.037
I’ve been yours for a long time.

01:27:34.246 --> 01:27:39.627
Now, you for the first time
are mine too.

01:28:07.404 --> 01:28:08.614
Henry.

01:28:11.950 --> 01:28:16.371
These men who were to die,
let them live.

01:28:17.665 --> 01:28:22.711
- It was done for you.
- I no longer care about the divorce.

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:26.006
I’m so in love with you,
my darling heart.

01:28:28.842 --> 01:28:32.012
Can it be true after this long time?

01:28:33.931 --> 01:28:38.310
God in heaven, I do love you
with my whole heart.

01:28:39.352 --> 01:28:43.190
And our love will make a son
that will rule the world.

01:28:43.398 --> 01:28:45.192
Our son.

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.903
A son. A son.

01:28:48.111 --> 01:28:51.699
With that and your love I’d be
the King I’ve always wanted to be,

01:28:51.949 --> 01:28:54.451
wise, generous, just, merciful.

01:28:55.744 --> 01:28:58.205
So I’ll kill no man for you.

01:28:59.414 --> 01:29:01.499
It’s like a new age.

01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:06.129
Wildfire in the air
and in the blood.

01:29:40.581 --> 01:29:42.499
Harry!

01:29:50.883 --> 01:29:53.301
The King sent for me to meet him here.

01:29:53.511 --> 01:29:55.220
Here?

01:29:58.056 --> 01:30:02.435
Perhaps he is jealous and testing
my faithfulness by bringing us together.

01:30:02.645 --> 01:30:03.979
Perhaps.

01:30:04.187 --> 01:30:08.233
- Has he reason to be jealous?
- No. Never

01:30:08.483 --> 01:30:12.738
Well, well. You're his concubine,
I have a hag for a wife.

01:30:12.946 --> 01:30:16.992
Now I am to arrest Wolsey
who began it all. Cold comfort.

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:21.246
- Arrest him? He's old and sick.
- I thought it was your doing.

01:30:21.454 --> 01:30:24.207
No. I’m past hating him.

01:30:31.256 --> 01:30:34.009
- Give him the warrant.
- Your Grace.

01:30:45.604 --> 01:30:50.943
Well, there's your first love.
The one you hated me for.

01:30:51.193 --> 01:30:54.530
- Did your heart race?
- No, you great royal fool.

01:30:54.738 --> 01:30:59.284
- I’m a happy man.
- And I, My Great King,

01:30:59.492 --> 01:31:01.411
I’m with child.

01:31:04.122 --> 01:31:05.457
Annee.

01:31:07.042 --> 01:31:10.963
Nan. Nan!

01:31:32.359 --> 01:31:34.111
Where is she? What keeps her?

01:31:34.319 --> 01:31:36.321
The Lady...

01:31:48.166 --> 01:31:50.460
- Begin. Begin.
- Yes.

01:31:51.086 --> 01:31:54.715
Your Grace, the door must be open,
that is to say, for legality.

01:31:54.923 --> 01:31:58.468
- Witnesses are required.
- Here they are. On, man, on, on.

01:31:58.677 --> 01:32:03.516
It’s a new fashion. Marry the one
before you divorce the other.

01:32:04.432 --> 01:32:07.770
Henry, wilt thou take Annee,
here present, to thy lawful wife

01:32:07.978 --> 01:32:11.023
- according to the rites of the Church?
- I will.

01:32:11.231 --> 01:32:14.693
Annee, wilt thou take Henry,
here present, to thy lawful husband

01:32:14.902 --> 01:32:17.571
according to the rites
of our Holy Mother Church?

01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:19.406
I will.

01:32:19.657 --> 01:32:22.868
- ''I, Henry, take thee, Annee.''
- I, Henry, take thee, Annee...

01:32:23.076 --> 01:32:25.913
- ''To my wedded wife.''
- To my wedded wife.

01:32:26.121 --> 01:32:28.206
''To my wedded wife,
to have and to...''

01:32:28.415 --> 01:32:31.669
To my wedded wife, to have and to hold,
for better, for worse,

01:32:31.835 --> 01:32:34.838
- in sickness and in health...
- ''Till death us do part.''

01:32:35.088 --> 01:32:37.424
and thereto I plight thee my troth.

01:32:37.633 --> 01:32:41.554
And after that, Nan,
you shall have bells and the crowning.

01:32:47.225 --> 01:32:50.521
Stand back. Stand back.

01:32:52.064 --> 01:32:56.234
- Out of the way.
- Stand back. Stand back!

01:33:12.501 --> 01:33:14.712
Here, Nan, for luck.

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:17.172
The flowers of May.

01:34:09.057 --> 01:34:11.810
How much were they paid to cheer?

01:34:12.019 --> 01:34:15.022
A groat each.
A thousand between here and Westminster.

01:34:15.230 --> 01:34:19.026
They should've got a silver penny.
They'd have thrown caps in the air.

01:34:19.234 --> 01:34:21.612
God save Queen Catherine!

01:34:21.862 --> 01:34:24.322
We've been outbid
by the Spanish Ambassador.

01:34:24.532 --> 01:34:26.491
Whore! King's whore!

01:34:29.119 --> 01:34:31.079
Long live the Queen!

01:34:31.288 --> 01:34:35.292
- There's an honest fellow.
- Which queen does he mean, My Lord?

01:34:36.669 --> 01:34:39.922
- Whore!
- Long live the true Queen!

01:34:40.130 --> 01:34:41.882
Whore!

01:34:42.090 --> 01:34:46.219
Long live Queen Catherine! Whore!

01:34:46.428 --> 01:34:48.639
Heralds, play!

01:34:58.774 --> 01:35:02.110
- Long live Queen Catherine!
- Whore!

01:35:31.389 --> 01:35:32.600
Out! Out!

01:35:32.808 --> 01:35:35.853
The King would speak with his Queen.
Out!

01:35:38.188 --> 01:35:40.691
Come here.

01:35:45.613 --> 01:35:48.907
It’s a long time
since I’ve kissed a queen.

01:35:54.037 --> 01:35:57.124
Nan, I’ve kept
every part of the bargain.

01:35:57.332 --> 01:36:00.002
Will you be happy now?
My Queen, my woman, my...

01:36:00.210 --> 01:36:03.213
- Whore, the crowd said.
- Damn the Spanish Ambassador!

01:36:03.421 --> 01:36:05.591
You must outbid him at the christening.

01:36:05.841 --> 01:36:08.927
In four months when I give you a son
I want cheers of joy.

01:36:09.136 --> 01:36:10.554
They wont need bribes.

01:36:10.804 --> 01:36:13.974
It'll be the happiest day
in the history of this kingdom.

01:36:18.896 --> 01:36:21.732
Would you rape a pregnant woman?

01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:24.693
Oh, Nan. God, forgive me.

01:36:24.902 --> 01:36:27.905
You great royal fool!

01:36:29.782 --> 01:36:32.075
Whoa there, boy.

01:36:40.417 --> 01:36:42.460
Go and get her!

01:36:44.922 --> 01:36:48.008
- Your pardon, madam, the Queen calls.
- Is it born? A boy?

01:36:48.216 --> 01:36:51.053
It is nearly time, the midwife says.

01:36:55.891 --> 01:36:57.935
Fetch the King.

01:36:59.937 --> 01:37:02.355
I’ve waited 20 years for this.

01:37:02.565 --> 01:37:06.026
I shall teach him to ride,
wrestle, draw a bow.

01:37:06.234 --> 01:37:08.320
It makes a man young again
to have a son.

01:37:08.529 --> 01:37:10.322
Your Majesty!

01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:13.701
Your Majesty!

01:37:13.951 --> 01:37:16.203
Here comes my good news.

01:37:24.628 --> 01:37:26.839
The child is born!

01:37:38.475 --> 01:37:42.104
The child is perfectly formed
and in good health, Your Majesty.

01:37:43.647 --> 01:37:47.359
I have failed.
I have failed.

01:37:47.610 --> 01:37:49.862
God help me

01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:51.947
Give me privacy.

01:37:54.241 --> 01:37:58.621
Don't weep. Pinch your cheeks
and give them colour. Sit up and smile.

01:37:58.829 --> 01:38:01.331
Your are the Queen. Brazen it out.

01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:04.877
A girl this time, but a boy
the next time. Do you hear me?

01:38:05.836 --> 01:38:09.256
- Is she beautiful?
- Yes, she is.

01:38:13.093 --> 01:38:16.722
Give me the child.
Give me my daughter.

01:38:45.959 --> 01:38:48.921
Is he well? Is he strong?

01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:50.798
My Lord...

01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:56.261
Those are lungs that will out-bellow
the Spanish Ambassador. Ey, Nan?

01:38:56.469 --> 01:38:59.347
And the eyes. The eyes are clever.

01:38:59.557 --> 01:39:03.018
We'll call him Edward.
It’s a lucky name for English Kings.

01:39:04.352 --> 01:39:06.730
I have borne you a daughter,
Your Majesty.

01:39:10.067 --> 01:39:12.194
- A daughter?
- Yes.

01:39:15.906 --> 01:39:18.283
Why did no one tell me
before I entered?

01:39:18.491 --> 01:39:20.828
I wanted to tell you myself, Hal.

01:39:21.537 --> 01:39:24.289
We have a beautiful daughter.

01:39:24.497 --> 01:39:27.459
Next time, a son.

01:39:29.837 --> 01:39:31.213
Elizabeth.

01:39:32.422 --> 01:39:34.257
We shall call her Elizabeth.

01:39:40.138 --> 01:39:43.475
- Is the child in good health?
- Perfect, Your Majesty.

01:39:43.726 --> 01:39:45.143
Good.

01:39:45.561 --> 01:39:49.064
Well, if we can have a healthy daughter,
we can have a healthy son,

01:39:49.272 --> 01:39:52.484
as you say, as you... say.

01:39:53.944 --> 01:39:59.116
I’ll kiss you and leave you, Annee.
God bless all here.

01:39:59.324 --> 01:40:01.577
Will you not kiss your daughter?

01:40:03.036 --> 01:40:04.622
My daughter?

01:40:05.956 --> 01:40:10.168
No. When she's older.

01:40:10.377 --> 01:40:12.505
When she has a brother.

01:40:35.611 --> 01:40:39.114
- Still no word from the King?
- No, Your Majesty.

01:40:39.322 --> 01:40:43.911
- No answer even to my letter?
- Nothing, Your Majesty.

01:40:44.119 --> 01:40:48.081
How can he so utterly forget so much?

01:40:48.290 --> 01:40:51.710
He does not forget, Mother.
He just has no wish to remember.

01:40:52.419 --> 01:40:54.838
But rumours say that
all is not well with them.

01:40:55.088 --> 01:40:59.259
Still no sign of a son.
That woman is in despair, they say.

01:40:59.467 --> 01:41:03.471
For already my beloved father's eye
has started to wander again.

01:41:03.681 --> 01:41:06.308
Poor Hal.

01:41:06.517 --> 01:41:07.935
Poor Hal.

01:41:08.852 --> 01:41:13.398
- You pity him?
- Was I not his much-loved wife?

01:41:15.943 --> 01:41:17.820
And you are his daughter.

01:41:18.278 --> 01:41:22.700
Unless he has a son of a true marriage,
you are his heir.

01:41:23.366 --> 01:41:25.285
You must be Queen.

01:41:26.411 --> 01:41:28.413
And remember,

01:41:29.164 --> 01:41:31.374
when I’m gone,

01:41:32.250 --> 01:41:34.377
you're first.

01:41:37.631 --> 01:41:40.968
Doctor! Quickly!

01:42:25.095 --> 01:42:28.140
Touch her and I’ll have her
sent from court.

01:42:28.348 --> 01:42:29.642
Who?

01:42:29.850 --> 01:42:34.605
That half-witted Seymour who is always
so tongue-tied and blushing and adoring

01:42:34.855 --> 01:42:37.190
- when you enter my chamber.
- She's a child.

01:42:37.399 --> 01:42:42.404
- But you would get a child by her.
- But not by you, except a useless girl.

01:42:42.613 --> 01:42:47.785
Mind your tongue or I’ll have you sent
from court to cool your temper, madam.

01:43:07.387 --> 01:43:09.932
Play on! Play!

01:43:10.140 --> 01:43:14.019
The Queen is tired, but does not wish
to spoil your pleasure.

01:43:14.227 --> 01:43:16.188
Play!

01:43:19.441 --> 01:43:21.401
Jane.

01:43:29.535 --> 01:43:33.455
I...
I think we shall dance well together.

01:43:35.123 --> 01:43:39.086
If I lead strongly,
will you softly follow?

01:43:39.294 --> 01:43:42.005
I hope so, Your Grace.

01:43:44.174 --> 01:43:48.554
That little sheep won't hold the
royal bull beyond the first encounter.

01:43:54.017 --> 01:43:55.644
I order you!

01:44:15.122 --> 01:44:16.915
Leave us.

01:44:23.964 --> 01:44:26.424
Where is Jane Seymour?

01:44:26.634 --> 01:44:30.721
Cromwell tells me when the dance was
ended, she was sent away under guard.

01:44:30.971 --> 01:44:33.390
She's on her way to Northumberland.

01:44:33.599 --> 01:44:38.729
As far away as I could send her,
since we don't own Scotland.

01:44:39.730 --> 01:44:45.611
She has the face of a simpering sheep,
and the mAnneers. But not the morals.

01:44:45.819 --> 01:44:48.781
I don't want her near me.

01:44:48.989 --> 01:44:52.409
- You will bring her back!
- I think not!

01:44:53.994 --> 01:44:58.791
If you want her near you, find a place
for her in your palace at Whitehall.

01:44:58.999 --> 01:45:03.837
Whilst I am here,
Jane Seymour must lie elsewhere.

01:45:12.262 --> 01:45:13.556
Tell her.

01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:23.649
Your Majesty, the people say
that you are the witch Queen.

01:45:23.857 --> 01:45:25.693
Are we ruled by superstition?

01:45:25.943 --> 01:45:28.904
Catherine still lives
in the heart of the people.

01:45:29.112 --> 01:45:33.576
The people say that her daughter
is the heir and yours the bastard.

01:45:33.784 --> 01:45:35.410
I do not fear the people.

01:45:35.619 --> 01:45:40.165
The people hate you, madam,
for displacing Queen Catherine

01:45:40.373 --> 01:45:43.877
and tearing the King
away from the true Church.

01:45:44.127 --> 01:45:46.839
As they hate me
for despoiling the monasteries.

01:45:47.047 --> 01:45:50.133
But the King, they truly love.

01:45:50.383 --> 01:45:54.680
You and I, madam,
live in the protection of the King.

01:45:54.888 --> 01:45:56.181
So?

01:45:57.099 --> 01:46:00.894
So in Parliament,
which speaks for the people,

01:46:01.103 --> 01:46:04.732
there is a bill.
It is called the Act of Succession.

01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:07.317
It makes your daughter the heir

01:46:07.526 --> 01:46:10.571
and Catherine's daughter, Mary,
illegitimate.

01:46:10.779 --> 01:46:17.786
If the King does not wish it, the
Act of Succession will not be passed.

01:46:18.871 --> 01:46:21.206
Would you sacrifice
the child of our love

01:46:21.414 --> 01:46:24.167
to get a silly little harlot
brought back to court?

01:46:24.376 --> 01:46:27.212
One daughter is much like another.

01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:29.798
I care not who's named bastard
when I’m dead.

01:46:30.048 --> 01:46:32.092
If I bring Jane Seymour back

01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:36.096
you will have Parliament
pass the Act of Succession?

01:46:39.141 --> 01:46:40.433
Yes.

01:46:42.269 --> 01:46:44.647
What a liar you are.

01:46:47.399 --> 01:46:52.112
What good is that Act
unless every man in the kingdom

01:46:52.279 --> 01:46:56.617
who has power to accept my child
as legitimate heir

01:46:56.825 --> 01:47:01.163
first swears an oath of fealty
to you as Head of the Church?

01:47:01.371 --> 01:47:04.917
And if they do not, Act of Succession
or no Act of Succession,

01:47:05.125 --> 01:47:09.505
they will say my child is the bastard
and there's an end!

01:47:18.055 --> 01:47:19.431
Go.

01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:42.245
Nan, if you love me, don't defy me.
Bring her back.

01:47:42.871 --> 01:47:44.873
I love you.

01:47:45.082 --> 01:47:49.419
I shall go to my grave loving you,
no doubt, and hating you.

01:47:50.504 --> 01:47:52.715
I will bring her back to my court

01:47:52.923 --> 01:47:57.177
if the oath is sworn
by all men of power, high and low.

01:47:57.385 --> 01:47:59.930
But those who refuse must die.

01:48:00.931 --> 01:48:04.142
- You once said they must not die.
- You once said they must.

01:48:04.351 --> 01:48:06.520
And now so say I.

01:48:08.731 --> 01:48:10.357
Annee.

01:48:11.191 --> 01:48:12.776
Annee.

01:48:13.986 --> 01:48:16.739
If you love me, forget the succession.

01:48:16.947 --> 01:48:19.449
If you remember how it all came about,

01:48:19.658 --> 01:48:25.080
how can you look me in my eyes
and say our daughter will not succeed?

01:48:25.288 --> 01:48:28.792
Because it would need unlimited murder.
Nan, look at me.

01:48:29.042 --> 01:48:32.505
Is it fitting I should be Head
of the Church, Pope and King at once,

01:48:32.713 --> 01:48:36.759
a farce so that so many men must die?
Could you sign the death warrants?

01:48:36.967 --> 01:48:40.721
I’d sign 10,000
rather than disinherit my blood!

01:48:40.929 --> 01:48:44.057
It’s that, or else it's my blood
and Elizabeth's.

01:48:44.266 --> 01:48:47.435
Cromwell knows that.
Your butcher cleaver man knows that.

01:48:47.645 --> 01:48:51.106
Send him to implement these details,
and let it be done quickly.

01:48:51.314 --> 01:48:56.194
High or low, they will sign.
I wish I were loved, but I’m not.

01:48:56.403 --> 01:49:01.700
And yet I am Queen of this island
and Elizabeth also shall be Queen.

01:49:03.118 --> 01:49:05.328
For Elizabeth, no.

01:49:06.413 --> 01:49:09.542
For her I will not commit murder.

01:49:11.627 --> 01:49:15.548
Annee, if we had a male heir,

01:49:15.756 --> 01:49:17.132
your son and mine...

01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:22.012
I can be angrier than you've seen me.
I know where your heart is, not with me.

01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:25.223
What has love got to do
with begetting of a king?

01:49:25.808 --> 01:49:27.935
I’m not young. I’m not true.

01:49:28.143 --> 01:49:31.897
I’m bitter. I’m envious.
I’m dangerous. I’m malicious!

01:49:34.858 --> 01:49:39.237
It’s your misfortune that you love me
now that I no longer love you.

01:49:41.782 --> 01:49:48.789
And yet, at this moment I want you
because of the anger in your face

01:49:48.997 --> 01:49:52.167
- and the spark of blood in your cheek.
- No.

01:49:52.375 --> 01:49:57.005
Annee, give me a prince
and everything would be forgotten.

01:49:57.214 --> 01:50:01.510
No! Not unless you kill them,
More and Houghton and Fisher

01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:06.557
and all who will not sign,
not unless Elizabeth is your heir!

01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:14.732
I’ll kill them, then.

01:50:14.898 --> 01:50:21.238
I rob, murder and commit sacrilege...
at your command.

01:50:21.446 --> 01:50:25.242
You do what you wish
and call the deed mine.

01:50:25.450 --> 01:50:30.497
I hate you.
I hate your desire and mine!

01:50:57.399 --> 01:51:01.319
I pray you, Master Kingston,
see me safe up.

01:51:02.070 --> 01:51:06.617
As for my coming down,
let me shift for myself.

01:51:22.465 --> 01:51:25.385
Good people, it has...

01:51:26.469 --> 01:51:30.473
The King's orders.
You must not be heard.

01:51:31.684 --> 01:51:35.020
Well, then I will not speak.

01:51:56.083 --> 01:51:59.086
I die the King's good servant,

01:51:59.294 --> 01:52:01.672
but God's first.

01:52:10.347 --> 01:52:12.516
No!

01:52:12.725 --> 01:52:15.435
No! No!

01:52:27.656 --> 01:52:30.618
- Well?
- A boy born dead.

01:52:35.497 --> 01:52:38.333
She has miscarried of her saviour.

01:52:46.424 --> 01:52:48.552
I am accursed!

01:52:50.888 --> 01:52:55.183
A live daughter and a dead son!
Did I accept excommunication for this?

01:52:55.392 --> 01:52:58.646
Did I send More, Houghton and Fisher
to their death for this?

01:52:58.896 --> 01:53:01.857
She cAnneot give me a living son!

01:53:06.737 --> 01:53:09.114
Very well, then.

01:53:09.322 --> 01:53:13.827
If she cAnneot give me a male heir,
I shall rid myself of her.

01:53:14.327 --> 01:53:17.706
Sir, with Catherine's death,
Annee is too firmly the Queen.

01:53:17.915 --> 01:53:22.753
Find a way. Find a legal way.
I will divorce Annee.

01:53:24.004 --> 01:53:28.216
Divorce is like killing. After the
first time, it doesn't seem difficult.

01:53:28.466 --> 01:53:34.222
Your Grace, we asserted English law.
Annee is now Queen by English law.

01:53:34.431 --> 01:53:38.476
Indeed. Indeed.
I divorced Catherine in good faith.

01:53:38.727 --> 01:53:42.815
But since that time, I have discovered
an impediment to my marriage to Annee.

01:53:43.023 --> 01:53:47.861
I had a child by her sister Mary.
That, too, is incestuous.

01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:51.907
We used the incest excuse last time.
We can't make a habit of it.

01:53:52.115 --> 01:53:56.954
Neither Pope nor Emperor will
uphold her and the people hate her.

01:53:57.162 --> 01:54:01.917
She'd fight. Her sister was married. You
couldn't prove it wasn't her husband's.

01:54:02.167 --> 01:54:04.169
- Who do you serve?
- The King, Sir.

01:54:04.377 --> 01:54:06.922
Your Grace can't afford
to start all that again.

01:54:07.172 --> 01:54:11.426
Then do you know another way?
No, you! You tied me to her!

01:54:11.635 --> 01:54:15.222
Now you find a way to get rid of her!

01:54:20.185 --> 01:54:21.854
Perhaps...

01:54:24.732 --> 01:54:26.483
...in her own life.

01:54:28.151 --> 01:54:30.237
Her life?

01:54:30.988 --> 01:54:32.364
Yes.

01:54:32.573 --> 01:54:35.826
Her marriage contract with Percy.
He had her.

01:54:36.034 --> 01:54:38.203
That's it, you crawling toad.

01:54:38.871 --> 01:54:43.416
No, Your Grace, not her past life,
the present.

01:54:44.877 --> 01:54:50.298
- The rumours that she has a lover.
- Annee? A lover?

01:54:50.508 --> 01:54:52.551
I, a cuckold?

01:54:53.886 --> 01:54:56.805
- Why, you're mad.
- If I could prove it?

01:54:57.055 --> 01:54:59.307
Invent it, you mean,
with false evidence.

01:54:59.517 --> 01:55:03.979
Adultery is high treason.
The penalty is death.

01:55:05.648 --> 01:55:07.440
Get out.

01:55:16.199 --> 01:55:17.785
Cromwell.

01:55:18.827 --> 01:55:21.789
It’s most kind of you
to come, Master Smeaton.

01:55:21.997 --> 01:55:23.373
I am honoured.

01:55:23.582 --> 01:55:26.544
When invited to supper,
I’m expected to sing for it.

01:55:26.752 --> 01:55:29.505
- As you do for the Queen?
- Oh, that is my pleasure.

01:55:29.713 --> 01:55:33.551
She wishes me to be the first
music teacher to the Princess.

01:55:33.801 --> 01:55:36.303
Please, sit.
No other guests.

01:55:36.512 --> 01:55:38.263
Thank you.

01:55:44.394 --> 01:55:48.398
Yes, for the Queen to make
the Princess your pupil,

01:55:48.607 --> 01:55:51.109
she must think most highly of you.

01:55:51.318 --> 01:55:54.487
Ah, the advantages of music.

01:55:54.697 --> 01:55:57.324
I did not know
that music interested you.

01:55:57.533 --> 01:55:58.909
It doesn't.

01:55:59.535 --> 01:56:03.789
I am interested in the Queen,
and you know her so well.

01:56:03.997 --> 01:56:06.124
Why, I’m merely a servant.

01:56:09.503 --> 01:56:14.091
I have the King's express orders
to protect the Queen's person.

01:56:14.299 --> 01:56:17.344
We have learned of threats.
Oh, many hate her.

01:56:17.595 --> 01:56:24.142
I am dining you, as I will dine others,
to get to know those whom I may trust.

01:56:24.852 --> 01:56:26.770
Oh, I see, I see.

01:56:27.312 --> 01:56:31.399
And it is true that she likes
to have you close to her, is it not?

01:56:31.609 --> 01:56:34.486
Without boasting,
I believe she prefers me to many.

01:56:34.695 --> 01:56:37.114
She prefers my style to the Italian.

01:56:37.322 --> 01:56:40.325
It is nearer to the mAnneer
she loved in the French Court.

01:56:40.534 --> 01:56:42.661
She learned to love
like a French woman.

01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:45.831
Yes, simple tunes sung with...

01:56:48.166 --> 01:56:51.629
You would be wiser not to laugh.

01:56:51.837 --> 01:56:55.173
It is a more valuable asset
than a pleasant singing voice.

01:56:56.049 --> 01:57:00.596
I make my way by singing. I’ve no desire
to go any further by any other route.

01:57:01.263 --> 01:57:02.723
Come now.

01:57:02.931 --> 01:57:07.686
There are only two reasons for you to be
constantly in the Queen's apartments.

01:57:07.895 --> 01:57:11.607
You love her,
or you are in the pay of Spain.

01:57:12.566 --> 01:57:17.738
- Why, I go when I am sent for.
- To love or spy? Which?

01:57:20.323 --> 01:57:21.992
I’m sorry...

01:57:23.410 --> 01:57:25.412
Which?

01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:30.918
You're too simple to spy,
I know that.

01:57:31.126 --> 01:57:34.421
- So it is love. You love her.
- No! No!

01:57:34.630 --> 01:57:36.799
You do not love your Queen?

01:57:37.049 --> 01:57:40.511
Well, yes, all right, I do love her.
As my Queen.

01:57:40.719 --> 01:57:43.556
- And she loves you.
- No, Sir, of course not.

01:57:44.306 --> 01:57:47.810
Barton, come out here.
Bring your papers.

01:57:48.602 --> 01:57:51.939
The last reply, but one.

01:57:52.105 --> 01:57:55.317
''Well, yes, all right, I do love her.''

01:57:55.526 --> 01:57:58.070
- What are you trying to make me say?
- The truth.

01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:01.949
- That you are the Queen's lover.
- Oh, no.

01:58:03.366 --> 01:58:05.285
No! No!

01:58:05.536 --> 01:58:08.205
- You first slept with her in February.
- I never!

01:58:08.455 --> 01:58:10.248
- On the 18th of February.
- No!

01:58:13.418 --> 01:58:16.379
Surely you remember
such an important date?

01:58:16.547 --> 01:58:19.800
- No!
- Come, try to remember.

01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:24.096
No! No! No!

01:58:26.932 --> 01:58:28.642
- Try!
- Yes!

01:58:28.851 --> 01:58:32.020
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:58:35.899 --> 01:58:40.028
Anyone can walk,
but can you walk with a train?

01:58:40.237 --> 01:58:44.116
- Yes.
- All right, head up.

01:58:44.324 --> 01:58:47.620
Go on. Good!

01:58:47.828 --> 01:58:49.705
Don't look round. Go on.

01:58:49.913 --> 01:58:53.792
It will follow you like a kitten's tail.

01:58:54.543 --> 01:58:57.755
Oh, what a queen it will make some day.

01:58:57.963 --> 01:59:00.716
- Enter.
- Madam, the Duke of Norfolk insists...

01:59:00.924 --> 01:59:05.513
Uncle! This is a rare honour nowadays.

01:59:07.305 --> 01:59:08.599
Leave us.

01:59:13.186 --> 01:59:16.439
Nan, brace yourself, girl.

01:59:16.690 --> 01:59:19.527
I have a warrant for your arrest.

01:59:20.402 --> 01:59:23.947
For my arrest?
A poor joke.

01:59:24.156 --> 01:59:25.991
It’s not a joke, Annee.

01:59:26.199 --> 01:59:29.828
I could've let others do it,
but I felt I could do it more gently.

01:59:30.078 --> 01:59:33.498
But I’m the Queen.
How could I be arrested? For what?

01:59:34.332 --> 01:59:37.961
Adultery, it says here.
Nonsense no doubt, but there it is.

01:59:38.211 --> 01:59:40.338
Adultery? With whom?

01:59:40.548 --> 01:59:42.841
- Smeaton, Norris and others.

01:59:43.091 --> 01:59:46.344
- I thought you were serious.
- I am.

01:59:46.554 --> 01:59:51.892
I am to take you to the Tower.
There's to be a trial. I am to preside.

01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:55.478
But I’m the Queen.
My child, she's the King's heir.

01:59:55.688 --> 01:59:58.524
Leave her with your women.
Annee, you must come at once.

01:59:58.732 --> 02:00:00.400
Elizabeth!

02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:05.072
Annee.

02:00:43.694 --> 02:00:48.657
Down? Master Kingston,
shall I be shut in a dungeon?

02:00:48.866 --> 02:00:51.952
No, madam. You will be lodged
near the room where you lay

02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:54.663
on the night before your coronation.

02:00:55.455 --> 02:00:57.666
Oh, Jesus, have mercy on me.

02:01:32.785 --> 02:01:36.539
I am Lady Kingston, madam.
I will wait upon you.

02:01:36.747 --> 02:01:40.959
Will you?
Then go away. Leave me!

02:01:41.168 --> 02:01:43.253
I fear, madam, that she must stay.

02:01:43.504 --> 02:01:46.256
Every word spoken to you
or by you must be reported.

02:01:46.464 --> 02:01:48.551
Send them away, Norfolk!

02:01:48.759 --> 02:01:50.135
- Leave us.
- But...

02:01:50.343 --> 02:01:52.054
Leave us!

02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:14.201
Shall I ever be allowed to walk out
and look at the sky?

02:02:14.409 --> 02:02:17.370
Shall I ever be free?

02:02:26.171 --> 02:02:31.510
Norris, Weston, his friends?

02:02:31.719 --> 02:02:34.555
His friends since I first met him?

02:02:34.763 --> 02:02:38.517
- And they are accused with me?
- Yes.

02:02:39.476 --> 02:02:42.312
He is willing to kill them
to get rid of me?

02:02:42.521 --> 02:02:46.609
- To kill his closest friends?
- [man] Come on! The other way!

02:02:49.486 --> 02:02:53.782
My brother.
Why have they arrested him?

02:02:55.117 --> 02:02:58.286
He also is accused of being your lover.

02:03:00.330 --> 02:03:02.791
Incest.

02:03:06.545 --> 02:03:09.632
Oh, God help me. The King is mad.

02:03:09.882 --> 02:03:11.967
I am doomed.

02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:16.138
Your Highness,
you are accused of high treason

02:03:16.304 --> 02:03:19.975
in that you, being the lawfully
wedded wife of our Lord the King,

02:03:20.225 --> 02:03:21.852
did commit adultery.

02:03:22.102 --> 02:03:24.563
I ask that you answer my questions.

02:03:24.772 --> 02:03:28.776
By what lawful authority
am I called here?

02:03:28.984 --> 02:03:34.907
I am your Queen. And, as such, share the
King's immunity from arrest and trial.

02:03:35.115 --> 02:03:39.244
Norris, Weston, Smeaton and Brereton
were tried and condemned ten days ago.

02:03:39.494 --> 02:03:41.789
If they are guilty, then you are guilty.

02:03:41.997 --> 02:03:44.875
- Did they plead guilty?
- They were found guilty.

02:03:45.083 --> 02:03:47.920
They were innocent as I am innocent!

02:03:48.128 --> 02:03:53.634
Any man, no matter who he is,
who says the contrary is a liar!

02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:58.388
My Lord, the warrant of treason
was issued by direction of the King.

02:03:58.597 --> 02:04:00.891
That is sufficient to give jurisdiction,

02:04:01.099 --> 02:04:05.771
however, so that there may be no
possibility of doubt as to her guilt,

02:04:06.021 --> 02:04:09.608
- will My Lord call the first witness?
- Call the Earl of Rochford.

02:04:10.358 --> 02:04:13.486
George Boleyn, Earl of Rochford,
come into court.

02:04:13.696 --> 02:04:15.573
The Earl of Rochford.

02:04:22.746 --> 02:04:25.165
Read the indictment.

02:04:26.166 --> 02:04:28.752
George Boleyn,
you are accused of high treason,

02:04:28.961 --> 02:04:32.089
in that on certain days and dates,
here specified,

02:04:32.339 --> 02:04:35.425
you did commit adultery
with Annee, Queen of England.

02:04:35.634 --> 02:04:39.179
Being your own sister in the flesh,
an act of incest.

02:04:39.387 --> 02:04:41.724
No! Not true!

02:04:41.932 --> 02:04:44.810
It is not your turn to speak.

02:04:45.018 --> 02:04:48.021
How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?

02:04:48.230 --> 02:04:52.484
You are a foul liar,
and my judges are your creatures.

02:04:53.569 --> 02:04:59.449
Stand up, Thomas Boleyn,
Earl of Wiltshire. Come to the bar.

02:05:04.955 --> 02:05:07.625
Do you recognize
these two here accused,

02:05:07.833 --> 02:05:12.087
known as Annee and George Boleyn,
as issue of your body?

02:05:12.295 --> 02:05:15.132
- I do.
- Look at them, My Lord.

02:05:17.384 --> 02:05:22.264
By the same mother, Elizabeth Howard,
daughter of the late Duke of Norfolk,

02:05:22.472 --> 02:05:25.768
and therefore full brother and sister
in the flesh

02:05:25.976 --> 02:05:30.063
so that their lying together
would be incest?

02:05:30.272 --> 02:05:32.858
- Yes.
- For which the penalty is death.

02:05:33.066 --> 02:05:37.154
Proper evidence will be introduced
later. Remove the prisoner.

02:05:46.246 --> 02:05:47.497
That's all, My Lord.

02:05:47.706 --> 02:05:49.332
As father of the accused,

02:05:49.542 --> 02:05:52.335
you are excused your duty as a judge
and may leave.

02:06:00.678 --> 02:06:02.805
Present your next witness.

02:06:03.013 --> 02:06:07.392
- Mark Smeaton, come into court.
- Mark Smeaton.

02:06:23.909 --> 02:06:27.705
My Lords, this man
was tried as a commoner.

02:06:27.913 --> 02:06:31.166
He confessed and was found guilty
of adultery with the Queen

02:06:31.374 --> 02:06:33.001
by a jury of his own order.

02:06:33.210 --> 02:06:35.671
He will give evidence against the Queen.

02:06:35.879 --> 02:06:38.340
Put your questions.

02:06:41.719 --> 02:06:47.558
Smeaton, did you have carnal relations
with the Queen?

02:06:52.312 --> 02:06:54.940
Smeaton, did you lie with the Queen?

02:06:57.776 --> 02:06:59.737
No.

02:07:00.946 --> 02:07:03.657
There is mercy only for those
that tell the truth.

02:07:03.866 --> 02:07:07.661
Three men have been found guilty
on your evidence. Was that perjury?

02:07:07.870 --> 02:07:10.539
You confessed to your guilt
knowing the penalty,

02:07:10.748 --> 02:07:14.001
knowing, unless the King is merciful,
you will be hanged,

02:07:14.251 --> 02:07:18.463
cut down while you still live,
disemboweled and your heart torn out!

02:07:18.672 --> 02:07:21.424
The King will not be merciful
if you lie!

02:07:21.967 --> 02:07:25.679
- Did you have carnal relations?
- Yes!

02:07:26.471 --> 02:07:30.559
My Lord of Norfolk,
may I question this man?

02:07:30.768 --> 02:07:32.394
I have not finished.

02:07:32.603 --> 02:07:35.939
Justice must be seen to be done,
Master Cromwell.

02:07:36.148 --> 02:07:38.942
- Proceed.
- Thank you, My Lord.

02:07:46.408 --> 02:07:49.745
Mark, look at me.

02:07:51.872 --> 02:07:55.125
I know well you have been tortured,

02:07:55.333 --> 02:07:58.962
but tell them the truth, Mark.
Have courage.

02:07:59.212 --> 02:08:02.257
- It is true.
- Write that. He says it is true.

02:08:02.465 --> 02:08:06.053
They have promised you your life,
haven't they? If you lie for them?

02:08:06.303 --> 02:08:09.932
They will break the promise.
It would not be safe to leave you alive.

02:08:10.140 --> 02:08:13.143
- It’s true.
- He says it is true for a third time.

02:08:13.351 --> 02:08:17.773
- We have our evidence.
- Poor gentle singer.

02:08:17.981 --> 02:08:21.985
Isn't it better, if you are to die,
that you die with the truth?

02:08:22.194 --> 02:08:26.239
I am guilty!
I was guilty with the Queen!

02:08:26.448 --> 02:08:29.535
Let me go now.
She came to my bed...

02:08:29.785 --> 02:08:32.204
Let me go.
She came to my bed, I swear it.

02:08:32.412 --> 02:08:36.166
Even when she tells him he will die
anyway, he still admits his guilt.

02:08:36.374 --> 02:08:39.211
Write that. Take him out.

02:08:40.253 --> 02:08:42.464
No. Wait.

02:08:44.758 --> 02:08:48.053
My husband, the King.

02:08:57.145 --> 02:08:59.523
Smeaton...

02:09:00.691 --> 02:09:03.611
...how many times
did the Queen come to your bed?

02:09:03.819 --> 02:09:05.821
- Many times.
- When?

02:09:06.029 --> 02:09:08.448
- I don't remember.
- You will remember.

02:09:08.657 --> 02:09:12.285
Call it to mind or you'll speak
with those who can jog your memory.

02:09:12.536 --> 02:09:15.956
Where did you couch with the Queen,
my wife?

02:09:16.164 --> 02:09:18.834
- York Place.
- That's a lie.

02:09:19.042 --> 02:09:22.546
- It could never have happened there.
- No, no, it was at Windsor.

02:09:22.755 --> 02:09:26.133
She only went to Windsor with me.
Can you think of no better lie?

02:09:26.341 --> 02:09:29.970
It was many places, it was
wherever you like, whenever you like.

02:09:30.178 --> 02:09:34.099
Oh, God, help me. Let me go free.
I’ll say whatever you like.

02:09:34.307 --> 02:09:39.062
Did Cromwell promise you your life
if you said this?

02:09:39.271 --> 02:09:43.108
- Answer me! Did he?
- Yes.

02:09:44.026 --> 02:09:49.281
He lied. Say what you like, Smeaton,
and you will not live.

02:09:49.489 --> 02:09:51.366
Say what you like.

02:09:51.575 --> 02:09:55.245
Speak now without lying,
for it will avail you nothing.

02:09:57.414 --> 02:09:58.666
I am to die?

02:09:58.874 --> 02:10:02.044
What happened between you and the Queen?

02:10:02.294 --> 02:10:04.713
Between us?

02:10:06.381 --> 02:10:08.383
Nothing.

02:10:09.176 --> 02:10:14.807
She was kind and pleasant and just.

02:10:15.015 --> 02:10:17.225
I would not hurt her.

02:10:17.434 --> 02:10:22.022
I lied because they have broken me
with ropes and irons

02:10:22.230 --> 02:10:24.024
and then promised I would go free.

02:10:25.734 --> 02:10:27.235
Take him away.

02:10:43.001 --> 02:10:44.837
And yet...

02:10:47.798 --> 02:10:49.967
...it could be true.

02:11:17.953 --> 02:11:20.706
For six years...

02:11:25.085 --> 02:11:29.965
This year and this...

02:11:30.173 --> 02:11:32.175
...and this...

02:11:32.384 --> 02:11:34.678
...and this...

02:11:36.096 --> 02:11:39.307
...I did not love him.

02:11:40.851 --> 02:11:43.020
And then I did.

02:11:44.479 --> 02:11:47.190
Then I was his.

02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:52.613
I can count the days I was his
in hundreds.

02:12:00.412 --> 02:12:03.206
The days we bedded.

02:12:05.501 --> 02:12:07.628
Married.

02:12:12.007 --> 02:12:14.051
Were happy.

02:12:17.429 --> 02:12:19.557
Bore Elizabeth.

02:12:23.519 --> 02:12:25.353
Hated.

02:12:29.441 --> 02:12:31.652
Lusted.

02:12:35.656 --> 02:12:38.742
Bore a dead child...

02:12:41.620 --> 02:12:44.665
...which condemned me...

02:12:49.628 --> 02:12:51.630
...to death.

02:12:58.929 --> 02:13:01.515
In all...

02:13:02.808 --> 02:13:06.144
...one thousand days.

02:13:07.354 --> 02:13:10.065
Just a thousand.

02:13:10.983 --> 02:13:14.027
Strange.

02:13:14.236 --> 02:13:18.907
And of those thousand, one,

02:13:19.116 --> 02:13:22.536
when we were both in love,
only one,

02:13:22.745 --> 02:13:28.375
when our loves met and overlapped
and were both mine and his.

02:13:31.419 --> 02:13:35.883
And when I no longer hated him,

02:13:37.300 --> 02:13:41.304
he began to hate me.

02:13:41.514 --> 02:13:45.100
Except for that one day.

02:13:47.603 --> 02:13:50.898
I’m not hungry.
Take the food and leave me.

02:13:52.107 --> 02:13:54.234
Nan,

02:13:55.027 --> 02:13:56.862
is it true?

02:13:58.947 --> 02:14:01.867
Have you stepped into your own trap,
My Lord?

02:14:02.993 --> 02:14:08.999
Any evidence you have against me,
you yourself bought and paid for.

02:14:09.207 --> 02:14:13.170
- Do you now begin to believe it?
- Annee.

02:14:13.378 --> 02:14:17.382
Annee, the court is still in session
to decide your... verdict.

02:14:17.591 --> 02:14:21.720
I don't want to hear your guilt from
them, I want to hear it from your lips.

02:14:21.970 --> 02:14:24.640
- That I was unfaithful?
- Yes, just that.

02:14:24.848 --> 02:14:28.561
Were you unfaithful to me
whilst I still loved you?

02:14:29.477 --> 02:14:34.482
Of course, I’ll never know. Whether
you say aye or no, I shall never know.

02:14:34.692 --> 02:14:38.403
You come here to make sure
whether there was truly adultery

02:14:38.612 --> 02:14:42.533
because that would touch
your manhood or your pride

02:14:42.741 --> 02:14:47.746
and even so, my heart and my eyes
are glad of you.

02:14:47.955 --> 02:14:52.626
Fool of all women that I am,
I’m glad of you here.

02:14:54.461 --> 02:14:55.921
Go, then.

02:14:56.129 --> 02:15:00.801
Keep your pride of manhood,
you know about me now.

02:15:01.009 --> 02:15:05.973
Nan, is it true
that you're glad to see me?

02:15:06.181 --> 02:15:09.184
- Yes, it's true.
- Then, Annee,

02:15:09.392 --> 02:15:12.395
let's do all gently for old time's sake.

02:15:12.605 --> 02:15:18.026
I have no wish to harm you,
and your words have moved me deeply.

02:15:18.235 --> 02:15:20.571
I must be free to have a son,

02:15:20.779 --> 02:15:24.157
and the son must be free
to rule England when I die.

02:15:24.366 --> 02:15:27.786
Why must you leave a king to follow you?
Why not a queen?

02:15:27.995 --> 02:15:32.332
This country has never been ruled
by a queen. It never could be.

02:15:33.542 --> 02:15:37.630
We can never have a son now,
God has spoken.

02:15:37.838 --> 02:15:41.925
I must have a son elsewhere.

02:15:43.010 --> 02:15:46.764
And it's getting late.
I’m not as young as I was.

02:15:46.972 --> 02:15:48.265
What do you want of me?

02:15:48.516 --> 02:15:53.228
Agree to Anneul the marriage
and give up all rights.

02:15:53.436 --> 02:15:58.191
You shall go abroad and take Elizabeth
with you. You will be well cared for.

02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:00.443
Please set me free.

02:16:00.694 --> 02:16:05.448
To marry Seymour
and make our child a bastard?

02:16:06.241 --> 02:16:09.745
No. No. No.

02:16:09.995 --> 02:16:13.541
Nan... Nan, you leave me no choice!

02:16:13.749 --> 02:16:17.628
Once I told you any children we had
would not be bastards.

02:16:17.836 --> 02:16:20.714
You promised marriage and the Crown.

02:16:20.923 --> 02:16:25.177
Now you try to dance out
of your promise. Well, I won't have it!

02:16:25.385 --> 02:16:30.766
We are man and wife together.
King and Queen. I keep that.

02:16:30.974 --> 02:16:33.018
Take it from me as best you can.

02:16:33.226 --> 02:16:37.272
Then you have decided, and so have I!

02:16:37.940 --> 02:16:40.859
Before you go,
perhaps you should hear one thing.

02:16:41.652 --> 02:16:45.906
I lied to you.
I said ''I love you'', but I lied.

02:16:46.114 --> 02:16:49.284
I was untrue. Untrue with many.

02:16:49.492 --> 02:16:51.369
- That is a lie.
- It is true.

02:16:51.620 --> 02:16:54.246
I was unfaithful to you
with all of them.

02:16:54.456 --> 02:16:59.044
With half your court! With soldiers
of your guard, grooms, stable hands.

02:16:59.252 --> 02:17:02.673
Look, for the rest of your life,
at every man that ever knew me

02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:06.050
and wonder if I didn't find him
a better man than you!

02:17:06.843 --> 02:17:09.429
You whore!

02:17:09.805 --> 02:17:13.851
But Elizabeth was yours.
Watch her as she grows.

02:17:14.058 --> 02:17:17.228
She's yours. She's a Tudor.

02:17:17.437 --> 02:17:20.691
Get yourself a son on that
sweet pale girl if you can

02:17:20.898 --> 02:17:24.570
and hope that it will live.
But Elizabeth shall reign after you.

02:17:24.778 --> 02:17:28.406
Yes! Elizabeth,
child of Annee the whore

02:17:28.616 --> 02:17:33.452
and Henry the bloodstained lecher,
shall be Queen.

02:17:34.162 --> 02:17:38.040
You've asked for death
and you shall have it.

02:17:38.250 --> 02:17:40.377
So be it.

02:17:40.628 --> 02:17:44.798
Only what I take to my grave,
you take to yours.

02:17:45.007 --> 02:17:47.800
And think of this, Henry.

02:17:48.010 --> 02:17:51.722
Elizabeth shall be a greater queen
than any king of yours.

02:17:51.930 --> 02:17:55.392
She shall rule a greater England
than you could ever have built.

02:17:55.601 --> 02:17:59.103
Yes! My Elizabeth shall be Queen.

02:17:59.312 --> 02:18:03.400
And my blood will have been well spent.

02:18:30.593 --> 02:18:34.807
She's lying.
She was never unfaithful to me.

02:18:36.642 --> 02:18:41.228
She could. Any woman could.

02:18:41.438 --> 02:18:44.983
No. She lies.

02:18:45.609 --> 02:18:50.280
If she lies, let her die for lying.

02:18:52.156 --> 02:18:53.700
Let her die!

02:19:16.263 --> 02:19:20.519
- Is everything ready?
- Yes, My Lord. The Queen is at prayer.

02:19:20.727 --> 02:19:23.731
Fetch her.
The time for prayer is passed.

02:19:32.781 --> 02:19:37.076
- And where is the King?
- At Richmond. Out hunting.

02:19:37.745 --> 02:19:39.830
Will you join him later?

02:19:40.038 --> 02:19:43.751
No, by God.
For me there's killing enough this day.

02:19:46.587 --> 02:19:48.839
[executioner speaks French]

02:20:22.372 --> 02:20:24.332
Will it hurt?

02:20:25.083 --> 02:20:28.003
They say not, My Lady.

02:20:28.211 --> 02:20:32.424
The executioner from France
is an expert with the sword.

02:20:33.634 --> 02:20:38.430
I hear that he is good.
And I have a little neck.

02:20:38.639 --> 02:20:42.184
- Oh, My Lady.
- No, Kingston. No.

02:20:42.392 --> 02:20:46.313
Come, I am glad to die.

02:21:13.006 --> 02:21:15.258
The month is May.

02:21:16.594 --> 02:21:20.347
- My Lady?
- Nothing.

02:22:59.780 --> 02:23:02.616
Mon Dleu! She looks at me!
Distract her!

02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:18.841
- Away, My Lords.
- Where to, Your Grace?

02:23:19.883 --> 02:23:22.219
To Mistress Seymour's.

02:24:01.216 --> 02:24:07.014
Elizabeth shall be a greater
queen than any king of yours.

02:24:07.222 --> 02:24:12.185
She shall rule a greater England
than you could ever have built.

02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:17.608
My Elizabeth shall be Queen.

02:24:17.816 --> 02:24:21.904
And my blood will have been well spent.
