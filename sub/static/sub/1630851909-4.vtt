WEBVTT

00:33.875 --> 00:36.708
Good morning, good morning

00:37.291 --> 00:39.041
The day is bright and fine

00:39.125 --> 00:42.750
So open up your shutters

00:44.250 --> 00:47.000
Good morning, good morning

00:47.583 --> 00:49.291
Now you have to get up soon

00:49.375 --> 00:52.583
Wake up and stretch your body

00:52.666 --> 00:54.750
And let's stretch the body!

00:54.833 --> 00:57.500
Good morning, good morning

00:57.583 --> 00:59.625
Check what weather we'll get

00:59.708 --> 01:03.166
Now I'll make my bed and leave

01:16.333 --> 01:18.875
A NETFLIX SERIES

02:05.958 --> 02:06.875
Tipped over?

02:08.791 --> 02:09.875
In the roundabout?

02:11.208 --> 02:12.416
On the roundabout?

02:14.125 --> 02:16.791
The word you're looking for
is "at" the roundabout.

02:17.416 --> 02:21.083
This isn't a prepositions class,
but it's relevant for me to know

02:21.166 --> 02:24.208
whether the car is
in the middle of the roundabout

02:24.291 --> 02:25.583
and blocking traffic,

02:26.125 --> 02:29.416
or if you're just mentioning
the roundabout so I know where to look.

02:29.958 --> 02:31.333
Do you see the difference?

02:38.041 --> 02:39.000
Yes.

02:39.083 --> 02:39.916
Okay.

02:40.791 --> 02:41.875
At the roundabout.

02:42.791 --> 02:45.541
Yeah, I'll be there. Okay, bye.

02:48.208 --> 02:49.916
That was Vetle at the supermarket.

02:50.791 --> 02:53.625
The bookmobile
tipped over at the roundabout.

02:53.708 --> 02:54.625
I have to go there,

02:54.708 --> 02:58.250
and I'll see if I can find a dictionary
for Vetle while I'm out.

02:58.333 --> 03:01.541
-Are you taking the bike?
-Isn't the police car…

03:01.625 --> 03:03.791
Reinert has it, and he's not here.

03:03.875 --> 03:06.625
Okay, then I'll take the bike.
It's not that far.

03:09.250 --> 03:10.250
Then…

03:11.250 --> 03:12.875
Be strict when he comes back.

03:12.958 --> 03:14.458
If I'm not here.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.416
-I'm leaving. Bye.
-Bye.

03:25.625 --> 03:26.458
Good morning.

03:29.791 --> 03:30.708
Did I scare you?

03:32.125 --> 03:33.250
No. Good morning.

03:34.250 --> 03:35.916
Have you seen Reinert?

03:39.166 --> 03:40.208
No.

03:40.291 --> 03:42.958
Are you… sure?

03:45.458 --> 03:48.458
Yeah, I'm sure of that.

03:56.958 --> 04:01.166
Are you asking if I'm on a walk of shame
the day after Dad's funeral?

04:04.041 --> 04:05.916
No, that's not what I'm doing.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.833
I'm sorry. Sorry, that was stupid of me.

04:14.625 --> 04:18.583
As you can see,
number 52 has an exquisite finish.

04:18.666 --> 04:21.458
It's mahogany-stained cherry wood.

04:24.208 --> 04:27.583
The lining is very fine silk.

04:27.666 --> 04:32.500
You can see that there's matching lace
on the cover, pillow, and face cloth.

04:33.166 --> 04:34.666
Not to mention

04:34.750 --> 04:37.708
this opening and closing mechanism,
which is very special.

04:38.458 --> 04:41.333
Most caskets have a lid
that you put on and screw shut,

04:41.416 --> 04:42.750
while this is more like…

04:42.833 --> 04:44.375
Well, almost like a car door.

04:48.541 --> 04:49.875
So what's the price?

04:51.750 --> 04:52.666
The price.

04:55.375 --> 04:58.708
The price on this is… Yeah, what is it?

05:00.208 --> 05:02.875
It's 52,000 kroner.

05:03.666 --> 05:05.041
Fifty-two thousand?

05:05.125 --> 05:08.708
For a casket we'll only use for a day,
or a few hours, really.

05:10.333 --> 05:11.166
Guys.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.750
How can I win your trust?

05:16.625 --> 05:18.208
What are you hinting at?

05:19.333 --> 05:21.125
I could give you a discount.

05:22.083 --> 05:22.916
Let's say

05:23.958 --> 05:24.916
20%?

05:26.125 --> 05:27.958
-Are you haggling?
-Over a coffin?

05:28.041 --> 05:29.750
-It's just too expensive.
-Way too expensive.

05:30.416 --> 05:32.958
I agree. Or… that's understandable.

05:34.291 --> 05:38.333
If you'll follow me for a moment,
we have some options out here.

05:38.416 --> 05:39.375
Yeah.

05:40.083 --> 05:41.791
-It's expensive.
-Very expensive.

05:42.375 --> 05:44.541
Then there's this model.
It's very popular.

05:45.375 --> 05:47.125
And the price is?

05:47.208 --> 05:49.916
It costs 32,000.

05:52.416 --> 05:53.250
Yeah.

05:54.125 --> 05:57.166
If we're going lower in price,
there's this one.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.583
-Yeah.
-For 24,000.

06:02.541 --> 06:04.875
Mother grew up during the war, Odd.

06:05.750 --> 06:06.583
Really?

06:06.666 --> 06:09.333
-"Don't be wasteful."
-"Don't be wasteful," she said.

06:09.416 --> 06:11.750
"You shouldn't waste money
on things you don't need."

06:11.833 --> 06:14.500
Well, your mother
does actually need a casket.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.833
And what's more wasteful
than a casket that's going to burn?

06:19.458 --> 06:20.375
Good point.

06:22.041 --> 06:23.958
In that case, there's this one.

06:24.541 --> 06:25.458
Which is?

06:25.541 --> 06:28.708
Which costs 3,599.

06:28.791 --> 06:31.666
And with that 20% discount of yours…

06:33.458 --> 06:36.500
I just remembered,
we only have this one in XXL.

06:36.583 --> 06:37.666
We'll take it.

06:37.750 --> 06:41.291
It'll seem very large
for your little mother.

06:41.375 --> 06:42.291
It'll be good.

06:42.375 --> 06:43.625
-Yeah.
-We'll take it.

06:43.708 --> 06:45.166
-Yeah.
-That's good.

06:45.250 --> 06:48.208
Too bad I can't give you a body bag.
That would have been the cheapest.

06:51.666 --> 06:53.000
We're talking about our mom.

06:54.875 --> 06:56.666
That was unnecessary, Odd.

07:14.208 --> 07:17.166
A SALES CLASS WITH MARTIN JETTLAND

07:34.500 --> 07:35.583
Odd.

07:39.708 --> 07:40.666
I just…

07:45.541 --> 07:47.041
I don't know what to do.

07:47.125 --> 07:48.791
No. Join the club.

07:49.916 --> 07:52.500
I just sold a model eight,

07:52.583 --> 07:55.708
with a 20% discount.

07:56.375 --> 07:57.875
This isn't going to work.

07:58.416 --> 08:00.125
What's not going to work?

08:00.208 --> 08:03.750
I'm not going to make as much as I need
on the Gundersen funeral.

08:05.125 --> 08:09.583
One week with me behind the wheel,
and I've driven the parlor into a ditch.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.666
Because you sold a cheap casket?

08:13.208 --> 08:15.541
No, because I can't sell anything.

08:16.083 --> 08:18.208
Cheap coffin,
they're making their own programs,

08:18.291 --> 08:19.875
the family's making the food.

08:20.416 --> 08:24.041
We're lucky it's fall, or they'd probably
insist on picking their own flowers.

08:24.125 --> 08:26.750
Decorate the church
with crocuses and dandelions and…

08:32.541 --> 08:34.666
-I have to…
-They're going to take the house.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.125
The Gundersen boys?

08:38.208 --> 08:39.666
No, the bank!

08:41.250 --> 08:45.333
I have no income
because no one fucking dies in Skarnes!

08:49.000 --> 08:50.541
This funeral was supposed to…

08:52.291 --> 08:55.750
show the town
that we Hallangens can still organize

08:56.333 --> 08:59.041
proper and dignified funerals.

08:59.791 --> 09:01.833
Now, people are going
to take their departed

09:01.916 --> 09:05.333
to those fucking snobs in Kongsvinger.

09:05.416 --> 09:07.833
-It's just so fucking impersonal.
-But, Odd.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.791
Listen. You'll create
a nice, intimate, little funeral.

09:13.291 --> 09:16.958
-The important part is showing the bank--
-Have you seen model eight?

09:20.625 --> 09:22.041
Oh right. It's that one.

09:25.083 --> 09:26.541
It's huge.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.291
No cotton filling.
No shavings on the bottom.

09:30.375 --> 09:32.500
The cover that comes with it is this thin.

09:35.083 --> 09:37.333
I tried to sell this one.
It could have been lovely.

09:39.208 --> 09:42.041
Mrs. Gundersen is tiny.
She'll look like Twigson in this!

09:43.500 --> 09:45.458
There's enough room
for her and both her sons.

10:03.958 --> 10:05.166
Hello?

10:05.250 --> 10:06.541
Yeah, sorry.

10:07.083 --> 10:08.375
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

10:10.250 --> 10:14.625
-You wanted to say something earlier?
-Oh yeah. No, it was nothing.

10:15.458 --> 10:16.625
I think I figured it out.

10:18.125 --> 10:19.458
-Odd?
-Rose?

10:20.291 --> 10:22.250
-Odd?
-Coming! Yeah.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.916
Your phone rang several times,
so I answered.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.125
-Did someone die?
-No, it was the bank.

10:29.208 --> 10:32.375
-Oh yes.
-They wanted you to call them ASAP.

10:32.458 --> 10:34.166
Did they say what it was about?

10:34.250 --> 10:35.500
No.

10:40.916 --> 10:43.083
-There's nothing wrong, right?
-No.

10:43.708 --> 10:46.958
They probably wanted to discuss
life insurance or something. Thanks.

10:47.583 --> 10:50.750
Weird that they would want
to sell you guys life insurance.

10:50.833 --> 10:53.083
Yeah. Live came back, though.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.541
Dad had no insurance, so…

10:57.041 --> 10:59.000
No, we'll just have to toughen up
and keep going.

10:59.541 --> 11:00.541
We'll be fine.

11:26.458 --> 11:27.458
Live?

11:28.833 --> 11:29.666
Hi.

11:30.458 --> 11:32.500
Come by my office this afternoon.

11:32.583 --> 11:35.500
I was worried at the funeral yesterday.

11:35.583 --> 11:37.500
I'm a little busy actually.

11:37.583 --> 11:40.416
I have to take
some of these things to our storage…

11:40.500 --> 11:41.375
I insist.

11:51.333 --> 11:52.500
BOOKMOBILE

11:52.583 --> 11:55.041
-Hello.
-Yeah, back once again.

11:55.625 --> 11:57.541
-Where's the driver?
-He ran off.

11:59.666 --> 12:02.916
-And in the middle of the roundabout.
-Yeah, it was in the middle.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.500
-Drunk driving?
-I wouldn't rule it out.

12:07.416 --> 12:08.250
But yeah…

12:09.125 --> 12:11.000
Who reads this stuff?

12:11.083 --> 12:12.833
That's a good question.

12:12.916 --> 12:15.250
Maybe there's
a better selection inside the car.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.500
-Should I just start?
-Yes.

12:24.583 --> 12:27.625
Yeah, get it done
before the afternoon rush begins.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.250
Cheap paperbacks…

12:36.375 --> 12:37.458
Housewife porn.

14:14.833 --> 14:16.416
FAILED: PRESS HERE TO TRY AGAIN

14:19.708 --> 14:22.333
PRESS HERE TO TRY AGAIN

14:51.000 --> 14:55.458
I'M NOT FEELING WELL.
I'LL SEE YOU AT WORK TOMORROW.

15:22.625 --> 15:23.791
Reinert?

16:15.125 --> 16:16.500
Reinert, are you there?

16:27.041 --> 16:29.833
What do you think about bowling tonight?

16:30.375 --> 16:31.833
No. Shit!

16:34.250 --> 16:35.250
What is it?

16:36.791 --> 16:38.458
She started leaking.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.375
Shit.

16:47.916 --> 16:49.208
Old family secret.

16:50.583 --> 16:52.916
Dad would do this when bodies tore open.

16:55.458 --> 16:59.333
Thick plastic and duct tape.

17:08.291 --> 17:09.125
There.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.375
Or we can go to the Chinese restaurant.

17:16.250 --> 17:17.083
If you want to.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.291
-Odd.
-Just a moment.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.250
Damn it.

17:25.458 --> 17:29.125
I was just wondering if I should book
a table at the Chinese place tonight.

17:30.708 --> 17:32.333
Or we could stay home.

17:35.958 --> 17:39.083
Hello! Rose to Odd!

17:39.166 --> 17:42.000
Yeah, Odd here.
I'm just sewing shut a mouth, you see.

17:43.291 --> 17:44.541
Hers or mine?

17:47.375 --> 17:49.875
I'm sorry.
The Chinese place would probably be great.

17:50.416 --> 17:51.583
Or we could stay home.

17:56.083 --> 17:57.958
Why do you make her look good

17:58.041 --> 18:01.916
when you're going to put the lid on anyway
and no one will see her?

18:03.083 --> 18:04.291
Dignity.

18:08.041 --> 18:09.750
It's like Dad used to say, you know.

18:10.500 --> 18:14.333
No matter who's poor or rich,
we'll all end up in a ditch.

18:15.958 --> 18:17.125
-Odd?
-Yeah?

18:18.083 --> 18:20.291
-It's just a funeral, right?
-Yeah.

18:20.375 --> 18:23.625
I know you're really stressed now,
but you know what you're doing.

18:24.666 --> 18:27.875
It's going to be so great.
Everyone will remember this forever.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.500
I really hope they don't.

18:40.208 --> 18:41.125
Hi, Live.

18:42.458 --> 18:43.625
Judith?

18:43.708 --> 18:44.541
Yeah, you…

18:44.625 --> 18:47.791
I have to apologize
for what I insinuated earlier.

18:47.875 --> 18:50.375
-I wasn't thinking. I just…
-No, don't worry about it.

18:51.500 --> 18:52.583
What are you dragging along?

18:53.666 --> 18:55.916
Oh, that's…

18:56.000 --> 18:58.583
It's just a stretcher and some crap

18:58.666 --> 19:01.791
that I had to pick up
at the storage unit for Odd.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.458
It almost looks like a body.

19:06.833 --> 19:10.875
-So you have a storage unit over there?
-Yeah, across and to the left.

19:10.958 --> 19:12.708
-Yeah.
-So…

19:12.791 --> 19:15.583
-It looks heavy.
-No, it's much lighter than it looks.

19:16.333 --> 19:18.166
-Good.
-He's waiting for me.

19:18.250 --> 19:20.625
-Yeah, say hi for me.
-Okay, yeah. Bye.

21:30.375 --> 21:31.708
-Hi.
-Hi.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.083
What are you doing?

21:33.166 --> 21:36.875
I'm just filling up the bottom
of Mrs. Gundersen's casket a bit,

21:37.500 --> 21:39.333
so the casket doesn't look so huge.

21:39.416 --> 21:41.000
-Right.
-Dignity, you know.

21:41.500 --> 21:42.583
That's smart. Thanks.

21:52.583 --> 21:53.541
Are you okay?

21:53.625 --> 21:57.166
I was just thinking of
how so many are dying.

21:57.875 --> 21:58.708
Yeah.

22:00.041 --> 22:02.750
Maybe we should put the lid on the casket?

22:02.833 --> 22:03.708
Yeah.

22:04.291 --> 22:05.250
Let's do that.

22:08.083 --> 22:10.041
-Could you just help me a little?
-Yeah.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.750
-Have you got it?
-Yeah.

22:17.791 --> 22:18.750
There we go.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.458
-Let's see.
-There.

22:25.541 --> 22:27.416
Yeah, so…

22:28.750 --> 22:31.166
So this is going straight to cremation?

22:31.791 --> 22:33.083
Yes, it is.

22:34.583 --> 22:35.916
-Shall we go?
-Yeah.

22:44.291 --> 22:45.958
Yes, I know that.

22:49.208 --> 22:50.500
It pays the mortgage.

23:07.208 --> 23:09.125
A SALES CLASS WITH MARTIN JETTLAND

23:09.208 --> 23:11.125
Let's start with the important stuff.

23:19.291 --> 23:21.958
S-W-O-T. SWOT.

23:28.125 --> 23:32.083
We need to be
self-aware enough to diagnose this

23:32.166 --> 23:34.458
in order to run a successful business.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.083
Hallangen!

23:36.166 --> 23:40.125
What are
Hallangen Funeral Parlor's strengths?

23:42.083 --> 23:43.000
Well…

23:45.333 --> 23:46.541
Years of experience, maybe?

23:46.625 --> 23:50.583
Yeah, we've been burying people
in Skarnes for five generations.

23:50.666 --> 23:51.833
Yes.

23:51.916 --> 23:53.000
Weaknesses?

23:54.708 --> 23:57.791
-I don't know.
-Red numbers. That's why you're here.

23:59.333 --> 24:00.166
Yeah.

24:00.250 --> 24:01.208
Opportunities?

24:03.833 --> 24:05.125
People will always die?

24:07.958 --> 24:10.208
Yeah, and the next one: threats.

24:10.291 --> 24:11.583
Threats.

24:11.666 --> 24:14.708
What threatens Hallangen Funeral Parlor?

24:16.041 --> 24:16.875
I don't know.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.666
What's the reason you're going under?

24:21.208 --> 24:22.166
We're not going under.

24:23.041 --> 24:24.250
No, not yet.

24:24.333 --> 24:26.333
We've been in Skarnes since 1914.

24:27.041 --> 24:28.250
We're not going under now.

24:32.333 --> 24:33.666
What are you afraid of?

24:36.666 --> 24:37.875
I'm not afraid of anything.

24:38.416 --> 24:40.916
I just want to give people
in Skarnes nice funerals.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.458
What are you afraid of?

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
I think it would be a shame if we
had to send our departed all the way to

24:47.958 --> 24:48.916
Kongsvinger.

24:49.625 --> 24:50.583
Odd.

24:51.541 --> 24:52.541
What

24:53.666 --> 24:54.750
are you afraid of?

25:08.458 --> 25:09.958
I have no idea what I'm doing.

25:11.125 --> 25:14.500
I can't sell anything.
I've inherited an insane amount of debt.

25:16.083 --> 25:19.541
But no one fucking dies in Skarnes!

25:20.083 --> 25:21.000
Sorry.

25:35.458 --> 25:36.583
Can you hold this?

25:40.458 --> 25:41.458
You got enough?

25:55.250 --> 25:57.833
How would you describe
your general condition?

26:00.375 --> 26:01.250
Good.

26:09.333 --> 26:11.791
I don't have to remind you
of doctor-patient confidentiality.

26:13.250 --> 26:15.333
So we're done, then?

26:19.208 --> 26:21.333
I'm here if you need someone to talk to.

26:22.333 --> 26:23.541
It can be lonely.

26:48.541 --> 26:49.625
Hello.

26:50.291 --> 26:51.416
Hi.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.333
Are you almost done in there?

26:53.416 --> 26:54.916
I think I'll stay here.

26:56.083 --> 26:56.958
Until?

26:57.708 --> 26:58.541
Forever.

26:59.166 --> 27:00.000
Yeah…

27:00.750 --> 27:03.000
Yeah, as long as you have a plan.

27:09.916 --> 27:10.958
Sweetie?

27:13.875 --> 27:15.458
I have to tell you something.

27:22.833 --> 27:24.333
We're going to lose the house.

27:37.500 --> 27:38.666
What did you say, Odd?

27:44.458 --> 27:45.583
What did you say, Odd?

27:47.291 --> 27:48.375
What is that?

27:48.458 --> 27:50.583
That's champagne for you

27:51.208 --> 27:53.375
and apple juice for me.

27:58.750 --> 28:00.000
Really?

28:05.958 --> 28:07.333
-Are you serious?
-Yes!

28:16.000 --> 28:18.541
THE HOME OF ODD LIVE MOM DAD

28:18.625 --> 28:20.708
I have to call the Gundersen boys!

28:20.791 --> 28:21.625
Why?

28:21.708 --> 28:25.250
If you're having a baby in nine months,
those cheapskates have to pay up.

28:25.333 --> 28:27.875
I'll give you cross-sales,
little Baby Arvid.

28:27.958 --> 28:30.958
No, not Arvid.
We can't call it Baby Arvid.

28:31.041 --> 28:34.208
I don't give a shit what his name is.
We're having a baby!

28:37.500 --> 28:39.625
But "Baby Arvid" would be nice.

28:42.833 --> 28:44.750
THE HOME OF ODD LIVE MOM DAD

28:47.750 --> 28:50.250
I've been looking forward to this so much.

29:08.750 --> 29:09.833
Live.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.291
It's okay, Live.

29:14.541 --> 29:15.625
I'm here.

29:17.333 --> 29:19.250
Yes, I'm watching over you, Live.

29:21.375 --> 29:22.875
I'm right here, you know.

29:25.375 --> 29:26.583
I'm here.

29:27.958 --> 29:28.833
Yes.

29:42.041 --> 29:43.041
Hello?

29:54.166 --> 29:56.208
-Good morning!
-Good morning!

29:57.500 --> 29:58.625
Let's see…

30:03.125 --> 30:03.958
What the…

30:04.041 --> 30:05.875
Does someone want pancakes?

30:05.958 --> 30:08.250
Since when do you make pancakes?

30:08.791 --> 30:11.666
Since I received
two very good bits of news.

30:11.750 --> 30:13.833
-Okay.
-Let's see. That's yours.

30:13.916 --> 30:14.750
Thanks.

30:16.208 --> 30:18.000
-Exciting.
-Well, eat.

30:21.666 --> 30:22.500
Is it good?

30:23.541 --> 30:24.375
Okay.

30:25.375 --> 30:26.500
Number one.

30:28.083 --> 30:30.250
You're gonna be an aunt.
I'm gonna be a dad.

30:30.333 --> 30:31.166
Odd!

30:32.250 --> 30:34.791
Oh, that's so nice! Congratulations!

30:34.875 --> 30:37.375
Thank you.
It's so good that it finally happened.

30:37.458 --> 30:39.208
That's so nice! Finally.

30:40.166 --> 30:41.166
Number two.

30:42.083 --> 30:43.041
I did a cross-sale.

30:47.541 --> 30:49.208
-That's also really cool.
-Very.

30:49.291 --> 30:51.083
I almost don't believe you.

30:51.166 --> 30:54.708
I called the Gundersen boys yesterday
and convinced them

30:54.791 --> 30:56.375
to book a viewing.

30:58.500 --> 31:00.875
I guess the paternal instinct kicked in.

31:01.458 --> 31:04.666
I could have sold them sand in the Sahara.
They had no choice.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.458
I was that convincing.

31:08.125 --> 31:11.708
But wasn't that casket
heading straight for cremation?

31:11.791 --> 31:14.125
It was,
but now they're having a viewing first.

31:14.666 --> 31:18.625
I think it'll be nice for them, too.
They'll get to see her one last time.

31:20.541 --> 31:22.041
Should I help you drive…

31:22.125 --> 31:23.916
No, I did that this morning.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.666
But I'm going there later
just to check and be sure.

31:27.750 --> 31:28.666
Sure?

31:28.750 --> 31:31.000
That there's nothing to tidy up,

31:31.541 --> 31:34.041
-or that her nose is leaking, or…
-Right.

31:34.125 --> 31:36.333
Or that she smells.
That's not good at a viewing.

32:01.041 --> 32:02.166
Fuck.

32:57.333 --> 32:58.916
-Hi, Karsten.
-Hi, Odd.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.750
-Are you ready?
-Yes, I'm ready, but that eulogy…

33:04.791 --> 33:08.625
It's very important to me
that this funeral is perfect, okay?

33:10.166 --> 33:13.000
-Relax, Odd. It'll be okay.
-Good.

33:13.083 --> 33:16.041
I just need to check one last time,
you can never be too thorough.

33:30.291 --> 33:31.416
Yes, it's Odd.

33:32.666 --> 33:35.708
Yeah. No, just wait outside.
I'm coming. Yeah.

33:57.583 --> 33:58.791
What the fuck?

34:09.500 --> 34:10.583
Reinert?

34:29.375 --> 34:32.583
I think it's very nice
that you decided on a viewing after all.

34:32.666 --> 34:34.916
It's a very nice way to say goodbye.

34:39.916 --> 34:40.833
Reinert!

34:44.750 --> 34:47.208
Yeah, you had some good arguments.

34:47.291 --> 34:50.250
-Thank you. Well, yeah.
-Yeah.

34:50.333 --> 34:51.791
-Oh dear.
-What is it?

34:53.541 --> 34:55.958
I just noticed that the door is open.

34:56.041 --> 34:59.791
It's probably just the priest
who's arrived. I'll check.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.833
-Just wait here. Two minutes.
-Yeah.

35:06.250 --> 35:08.625
-We'll just wait here.
-Yeah. Just have to wait.

35:14.958 --> 35:16.750
No, no, no!

35:18.416 --> 35:19.916
Fucking hell!

35:40.083 --> 35:41.750
Reinert!

35:51.416 --> 35:52.375
I'm sorry.

35:52.875 --> 35:54.000
You're sorry?

35:54.791 --> 35:57.708
This is the funeral,
the finale of our mother's life.

35:57.791 --> 36:00.875
You charge an enormous fee,
and this is how she looks in the casket?

36:00.958 --> 36:01.791
Yeah.

36:02.625 --> 36:04.583
If there's anything I can do, I'll…

36:05.125 --> 36:07.166
Yeah, we want the money back, of course.

36:07.250 --> 36:10.208
-We'll go to the parlor in Kongsvinger.
-But…

36:10.791 --> 36:11.625
"But"?

36:11.708 --> 36:15.000
You can't charge us for a funeral
you're obviously not organizing.

36:15.083 --> 36:17.875
Be a little reasonable. Let's say… 50%?

36:19.750 --> 36:21.208
Are you haggling over Mom?

36:21.291 --> 36:23.458
-No, no.
-No?

36:23.541 --> 36:24.625
Come on…

36:24.708 --> 36:26.916
No, of course you'll get your money back.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.375
-Yes, of course we'll get our money back.
-Yeah.

36:30.125 --> 36:31.375
I take full responsibility.

36:31.458 --> 36:33.416
Yeah, do that. That's good.

36:38.750 --> 36:39.875
Oh dear.

36:39.958 --> 36:41.208
Mom would have been proud.

36:41.291 --> 36:43.541
-Yes, you shouldn't waste.
-No, you shouldn't waste.

36:55.166 --> 36:56.291
Reinert!

37:13.750 --> 37:14.958
Reinert?

37:22.250 --> 37:24.833
Hello, it's me. Live.

37:26.166 --> 37:27.250
Reinert…

37:32.416 --> 37:34.666
Oh God. Reinert.

37:34.750 --> 37:36.666
Reinert, are you okay?

37:42.833 --> 37:44.708
Reinert, I'm just going to remove the bag.

37:55.541 --> 37:57.500
I'm trying to remove the bag…

38:04.166 --> 38:07.333
Reinert, I… I'm trying to remove the bag…

38:54.208 --> 38:59.583
You've reached the voicemail of
police officer Reinert G. Tisthamar.

39:07.166 --> 39:08.041
Marianne?

39:10.000 --> 39:12.375
Something's not right here.

39:49.750 --> 39:50.625
Judith?

39:51.416 --> 39:53.166
Someone has found Reinert and Live.

40:14.833 --> 40:17.791
So you went to Reinert's house.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.416
And he was naked.

40:21.833 --> 40:23.333
With this bag over his head.

40:24.583 --> 40:25.500
Yes.

40:26.083 --> 40:28.208
You don't think that's a little strange?

40:30.916 --> 40:31.916
Yeah, it's

40:33.041 --> 40:34.500
really strange.

40:37.666 --> 40:39.583
Maybe it was sadomasochism?

40:40.916 --> 40:42.333
Asphyxiation sex.

40:43.125 --> 40:44.166
Bondage, you know.

40:46.166 --> 40:47.291
Reinert?

40:48.458 --> 40:49.458
Yeah.

40:54.666 --> 40:58.541
Because you went to his house
and caught him red-handed while he…

41:02.916 --> 41:04.583
And then he went nuts.

41:05.625 --> 41:06.541
Yes.

41:08.166 --> 41:09.375
And then he chased you.

41:10.791 --> 41:13.041
Yeah, but he wasn't entirely himself.

41:14.958 --> 41:18.416
And then he assaulted you?
With this bag still on his head?

41:20.125 --> 41:21.125
Yeah.

41:23.666 --> 41:27.291
You don't have anything against Reinert?
You're not holding a grudge?

41:27.375 --> 41:29.875
-No.
-There's no lovers' spat?

41:29.958 --> 41:30.916
No jealousy?

41:31.000 --> 41:35.708
No, I've just been trying to help
a friend who clearly isn't doing well.

41:36.208 --> 41:37.291
Yeah.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.375
I guess we'll have to wait
until Reinert wakes up.

41:44.833 --> 41:46.958
And hear his side of this story.

41:48.958 --> 41:50.041
We'll speak again.

41:51.041 --> 41:52.000
Yes, we will.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.500
I… I don't know… I don't know what…

43:50.583 --> 43:52.000
He…

44:00.083 --> 44:01.375
Do you still not get it?

45:41.583 --> 45:45.625
