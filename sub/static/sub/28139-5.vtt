00:04.091 --> 00:06.354
- Previously
on "Good Girls"...

00:08.704 --> 00:10.836
- It was an accident.

00:10.880 --> 00:11.968
- He ran behind the car.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.361
- Well, then I moved the body.

00:13.404 --> 00:14.797
- What are we supposed to do
with this?

00:14.840 --> 00:16.625
- We get rid of it.
- What do you want?

00:16.668 --> 00:18.540
- Is there any way you could
take her for the night?

00:18.583 --> 00:20.498
- So you can bone some other
pregnant lady's husband?

00:20.542 --> 00:22.152
- Yeah, she knows.
- Yeah, I'm aware. Thank you.

00:22.196 --> 00:24.241
- So I think it's pretty much
game over.

00:24.285 --> 00:26.069
- Do you think
I could make it in LA?

00:26.113 --> 00:28.115
- We'll put the vroom, vroom,
vroom, back in your--

00:28.158 --> 00:29.681
- Here's what's
going to happen.

00:29.725 --> 00:32.380
You're going to quit your job
and my husband.

00:32.423 --> 00:35.165
This is 5 grand.
Enough for a plane ticket

00:35.209 --> 00:37.167
and a little
to get you started in LA.

00:37.211 --> 00:39.082
I have a few ideas.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.562
If we start catering more
towards women,

00:40.605 --> 00:42.607
I think we could really
increase our sales.

00:42.651 --> 00:45.871
- We both have our own,
you know, superpower.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.873
Why would you want
to wreck that?

00:54.663 --> 00:56.882
- You didn't tell him yet?
- Tell me what?

00:56.926 --> 00:58.058
- We're partners now.

00:58.101 --> 01:00.103
- We threw a man away.

01:00.147 --> 01:03.237
all: One...two... three!

01:06.588 --> 01:08.764
- Tell me again.

01:08.807 --> 01:10.592
- It's kind of late.

01:10.635 --> 01:12.594
- Tell me again.

01:12.637 --> 01:13.682
- Which part?

01:13.725 --> 01:15.640
- Where you chopped
the dude up.

01:17.294 --> 01:19.253
And you stuck him
in the freezer.

01:20.863 --> 01:23.735
- She did that.
- Where'd you dump the body?

01:23.779 --> 01:25.824
- Downtown.

01:25.868 --> 01:26.912
- Where?

01:26.956 --> 01:28.697
- Hill and Snelling.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.224
- There's a lot of homeless
around there.

01:34.268 --> 01:36.574
- No one saw us.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.315
- That you know.

01:46.758 --> 01:48.151
Tell me again.

01:54.288 --> 01:55.593
You throw away his shoes?

01:55.637 --> 01:57.291
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

01:57.334 --> 01:58.770
- We threw out everything.

01:58.814 --> 02:01.164
- Okay, whose car did you take?
- Beth's.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.426
- Did you cover
the license plate?

02:02.470 --> 02:04.124
- Yes.
- Okay.

02:04.167 --> 02:05.908
Okay, what about people
with their dogs?

02:05.951 --> 02:07.649
- It was pretty late.

02:07.692 --> 02:09.738
- You don't think dogs like
to whiz late at night?

02:09.781 --> 02:11.218
- No one saw us, Stan.

02:11.261 --> 02:14.134
- That's what everybody says,
and they all get caught.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.439
Tell me again.

02:15.483 --> 02:19.878
- ♪ Looking for love

02:19.922 --> 02:24.013
♪ Looking for love

02:24.056 --> 02:26.233
♪ I'm still

02:28.452 --> 02:31.063
♪ Still looking

02:33.979 --> 02:36.808
♪ Looking for love

02:38.332 --> 02:42.423
♪ Looking for love

02:42.466 --> 02:44.947
♪ I'm still

02:47.079 --> 02:49.691
♪ Still looking

02:52.476 --> 02:54.174
- Why'd you tell me?

02:59.222 --> 03:01.355
- You said no more lies.

03:04.096 --> 03:05.533
- I'm an idiot.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.755
- Kids will be up soon.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.888
You want breakfast or...

03:15.238 --> 03:17.762
Where are you going?

03:17.806 --> 03:19.721
- Get ahead of it.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.773
- Beth?

04:55.817 --> 04:57.427
Hey. Morning.

04:57.471 --> 04:59.037
Kids want French toast.

04:59.081 --> 05:00.691
- Okay?

05:00.735 --> 05:02.998
- What's the egg-to-milk ratio?

05:03.041 --> 05:04.956
- I usually just eyeball it.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.959
- Hmm.

05:08.003 --> 05:09.700
- I'll be right out.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.049
- Thanks.

05:23.540 --> 05:26.282
- Morning, handsome.

05:31.809 --> 05:35.422
- Go away.

05:35.465 --> 05:37.075
- Hey, you are gonna miss
these moments

05:37.119 --> 05:38.555
when you go to college.

05:38.599 --> 05:41.341
- That's why I'm going
to college.

05:41.384 --> 05:44.909
- Will you take me with you?
Please?

05:44.953 --> 05:47.651
- Or I could just get
an alarm clock.

05:47.695 --> 05:52.352
- Yeah, but alarm clocks
don't have morning breath.

05:52.395 --> 05:55.746
- This is child abuse.

05:55.790 --> 05:58.140
All right.
It's time to get up.

06:00.447 --> 06:03.014
- Do I have to go to Dad's
this weekend?

06:04.625 --> 06:06.888
- Is she being cray?

06:06.931 --> 06:09.020
- Yeah.

06:09.064 --> 06:11.980
- Well, you know her hormones
are probably,

06:12.023 --> 06:13.808
like, out of control.

06:14.939 --> 06:17.289
- He cheated on her.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.682
- What?

06:20.162 --> 06:21.685
With who?

06:21.729 --> 06:25.210
- I think a friend of theirs.

06:25.254 --> 06:27.474
- Wow. No way.

06:29.258 --> 06:30.781
- Why would he do that?

06:32.957 --> 06:34.002
- Well...

06:35.438 --> 06:39.529
You know...
marriage is really hard.

06:39.573 --> 06:42.227
- Or he's just a dick.

06:42.271 --> 06:43.533
- Well...

06:43.577 --> 06:46.188
- Whoever he banged
is an even bigger dick.

06:46.231 --> 06:48.103
- Okay, you know...

06:48.146 --> 06:51.454
it's probably really,
really, complicated.

06:51.498 --> 06:54.544
- Or they're both just
king-sized bags of dicks.

06:54.588 --> 06:55.893
- Okay, time to brush
your teeth.

06:55.937 --> 06:56.894
Go on. Get out.

06:56.938 --> 06:58.418
Thank you.

07:10.517 --> 07:11.648
What?

07:11.692 --> 07:13.868
- Stan said there's a witness.

07:13.911 --> 07:17.524
- What does that even mean?
- It means someone saw us.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.482
- Like a camera?
- There were no cameras.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.484
We checked.
- Like a person?

07:21.528 --> 07:22.833
- No, a damn robot.
I don't know.

07:22.877 --> 07:25.532
- What did he say, exactly?

07:25.575 --> 07:28.404
- He was asking around at work,
and that is what he heard.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.884
- Oh, my God.

07:29.927 --> 07:32.713
- Well, I mean, a witness
could mean anything.

07:32.756 --> 07:35.759
- Someone saw someone
do something.

07:35.803 --> 07:36.934
- Exactly.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.283
- We just threw out
a bag of trash.

07:38.327 --> 07:39.633
- That's literally all it was

07:39.676 --> 07:41.417
from, like,
a purely visual standpoint.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.549
- There's only three bitches
in the world

07:42.592 --> 07:43.767
who know what we did.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.116
- Yeah.
- And they're right here.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.770
- Correct.

07:47.989 --> 07:49.817
- Four.

07:51.601 --> 07:53.603
Four bitches.

07:55.257 --> 07:56.606
- This isn't gonna work.

07:56.650 --> 07:58.390
I mean, we can't--
we can't stay here.

07:58.434 --> 07:59.696
- Oh, I'm sorry.

07:59.740 --> 08:02.046
Were you expecting
the Four Seasons?

08:02.090 --> 08:03.439
- I mean, there's no crib,
there's no tub.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.832
The boys have school.

08:04.875 --> 08:05.920
- I don't think
you're in any position

08:05.963 --> 08:07.487
to make demands right now.

08:07.530 --> 08:08.923
- Mommy! They have Nick Jr.!

08:08.966 --> 08:13.057
- Oh, that's--that's--
that's good.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.103
- Let's go over there
right now.

08:15.146 --> 08:17.148
- Yeah, and rough her up.

08:17.192 --> 08:18.323
Like, verbally.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.890
- Not if she's talking
to the cops.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.501
- What is this
shady trick's game?

08:21.544 --> 08:23.241
- She's just as guilty
as we are.

08:23.285 --> 08:24.591
- Uh, yeah, except guiltier.

08:24.634 --> 08:26.288
She did it!

08:27.550 --> 08:28.638
- So how'd they do it?

08:31.772 --> 08:33.556
- I mean, you know,
I already told you, so.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.557
- Tell the world.

08:34.601 --> 08:35.950
- Can we have some chips?

08:35.993 --> 08:38.648
- Yeah, just not
too many, okay?

08:38.692 --> 08:40.868
This place is way too small.

08:40.911 --> 08:43.348
- You ever been in a jail cell?

08:43.392 --> 08:45.655
- No?
- Real tight.

08:52.227 --> 08:56.187
- All right, so like
I told you, um...

08:56.231 --> 08:59.321
they ran him...

08:59.364 --> 09:01.018
O-V-E-R.

09:01.062 --> 09:03.412
You know, a bunch of times.

09:03.455 --> 09:06.067
And then they, um...

09:08.983 --> 09:14.510
They C-H-O-P-P-E-D up
his B-O-D-Y

09:14.554 --> 09:16.817
into tiny little pieces.

09:16.860 --> 09:20.864
With an M-A-S-H--
mm...

09:20.908 --> 09:24.564
M-A-S-H-I...
M... ma--

09:24.607 --> 09:26.043
- A mashi?
What the hell is that?

09:26.087 --> 09:28.219
- No, um, no,
you know, like a, um,

09:28.263 --> 09:34.225
like a giant--
like a giant K-N-I-F-E.

09:34.269 --> 09:36.837
An A-X-E?

09:36.880 --> 09:40.014
- No, I know
how to spell A-X-E.

09:40.057 --> 09:43.147
Like a big--like a big,
you know, like a big, um...

09:43.191 --> 09:45.802
S-W-O-R-D.
Like...

09:45.846 --> 09:47.848
- A cleaver?
- No. No.

09:47.891 --> 09:53.897
- Oh, um, you know, they had
them in R-A-W-A-N-D-A.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.943
You know? Oh, with that
terrible uprising.

09:55.986 --> 09:58.510
- Rwanda?
- Yes, but can you--

09:58.554 --> 09:59.511
- Machete!
- Shh!

09:59.555 --> 10:00.817
Machete?

10:00.861 --> 10:02.210
- Yes.
- Jesus.

10:02.253 --> 10:03.820
- Yes. I know.

10:05.474 --> 10:08.564
Can you just, like,
go arrest them now or--

10:08.608 --> 10:11.523
- Mm-mm, I need to find
the B-O-D-Y first.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.264
- Oh, yeah.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.572
How's that going?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.356
- We're getting there.

10:19.923 --> 10:21.708
- Yeah, that's good.

10:24.667 --> 10:28.628
- We need you to make it...
go away.

10:28.671 --> 10:32.544
- Without, you know,
making her go away.

10:32.588 --> 10:34.590
- Unless push comes to shove.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.376
Yes, I know. She's a mother.

10:38.420 --> 10:39.943
Yes, I know she has four kids.

10:39.987 --> 10:41.684
But we have, like, seven
between us.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.555
- What did I say about
your rotten egg?

10:43.599 --> 10:45.470
- So what do you want, a medal?

10:45.514 --> 10:46.689
- Yeah, maybe I do.

10:46.733 --> 10:49.170
- Can you somehow shut it down?

10:49.213 --> 10:50.650
- I can try.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.782
- Just to be crystal clear,
we need

10:52.826 --> 10:54.871
the situation that we're in
to go away,

10:54.915 --> 10:59.180
not the rotten egg
who caused the situation.

10:59.223 --> 11:02.313
- Yeah, I'm gonna need
200 G's. Fresh.

11:02.357 --> 11:04.794
- What?

11:04.838 --> 11:06.317
- Shutting things down
ain't cheap.

11:06.361 --> 11:08.885
- On top of what we're
already washing for you?

11:08.929 --> 11:11.235
- Jesus.
How much to just smoke her?

11:11.279 --> 11:13.716
- We don't have time
to sell that many cars.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.762
- It is what it is.

11:17.981 --> 11:20.462
You need time to think it over?

11:20.505 --> 11:21.811
Maybe a quick bathroom break?

11:23.552 --> 11:25.336
No?

11:25.380 --> 11:26.816
- No.

11:28.296 --> 11:29.384
We're good.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.391
- Really? Are we?

11:49.970 --> 11:52.494
Hey. Have you seen
this Fluff Challenge?

11:52.537 --> 11:54.409
The dog thinks the owner
actually disappears.

11:54.452 --> 11:56.063
It's hilarious.

11:56.106 --> 12:00.632
- How many cars would we
have to sell to make 200 grand?

12:00.676 --> 12:02.243
Ball park?

12:02.286 --> 12:05.289
- Uh...

12:05.333 --> 12:06.900
Like, you know, 20 or 30.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.858
It just kind of depends
on the model.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.381
- How about the Vettes?

12:10.425 --> 12:12.601
- Ooh, that takes
the right kind of customer.

12:12.644 --> 12:14.516
- Well, it needs
to happen quick.

12:14.559 --> 12:17.562
- Well that's--that's not
really how it works.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.739
Plus we don't have that kind
of inventory right now.

12:19.782 --> 12:22.959
- How do we get
that kind of inventory?

12:23.003 --> 12:24.569
- Oh, man.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.748
That guy.
What a--what a punk.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.880
I mean, he's already got
60% of the business.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.229
- It's not for him.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.796
- I am not gonna be
his little bitch.

12:33.840 --> 12:34.884
If he wanted an ATM,

12:34.928 --> 12:36.407
he should have knocked over
a 7/11.

12:36.451 --> 12:37.800
I'm trying to run
a business here.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.236
- It's for me.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.716
I need it.

12:42.065 --> 12:43.197
- Why?

12:43.240 --> 12:45.939
- Can you get the cars?

12:45.982 --> 12:47.592
- Yes.

12:47.636 --> 12:50.465
- Thank you.
- Maybe.

12:52.206 --> 12:53.773
- Is there a problem?

12:53.816 --> 12:55.775
- No, there's no problem,
per se.

12:55.818 --> 12:59.256
It's just--it's just more of,
uh, you know...

12:59.300 --> 13:01.781
a thing.

13:01.824 --> 13:05.045
- Oh, what a feelin',
We're wheelin' and dealin'

13:05.088 --> 13:08.352
at the Eastern Michigan
Auto Auction!

13:08.396 --> 13:12.008
Wholesalers, retailers,
come on down.

13:12.052 --> 13:15.751
We've got over 250
pre-owned vehicles

13:15.795 --> 13:19.276
with prices starting
at just $800.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.626
I'll be waiting for your call.

13:21.670 --> 13:24.455
Can you feel the deals?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.765
- I mean...

13:29.809 --> 13:30.940
- I know.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.028
- Wow.

13:32.072 --> 13:33.116
- I know.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.292
- I thought she moved to LA.

13:35.336 --> 13:36.859
- I bought her the ticket.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.643
- Looks like she did
for a hot minute.

13:38.687 --> 13:41.559
- Let's see,
she was Dead Girl on Pier

13:41.603 --> 13:43.300
on "NCIS Los Angeles."

13:43.344 --> 13:46.347
- I'm sorry, is she acting like
she works at the car auction

13:46.390 --> 13:48.305
or does she
actually work there?

13:48.349 --> 13:50.177
- Oh, she's like
the gatekeeper.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.701
And she's got Dean
on permanent waiting list.

13:52.744 --> 13:54.398
- She's blackballing him?

13:54.442 --> 13:56.661
- Yeah, I mean,
can you blame her?

13:56.705 --> 13:59.099
- Ooh,
also Mutilated Corpse in Woods

13:59.142 --> 14:00.883
on "Criminal Minds."

14:00.927 --> 14:02.537
And...

14:03.973 --> 14:05.845
Well, that's it.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.934
- So, we go down there,
we kiss her bony ass

14:07.977 --> 14:10.110
and tell her the cars
are for us and not Dean.

14:10.153 --> 14:13.243
- And by "we," we mean not you.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.289
- Yeah, you don't go anywhere
near her bony ass.

14:15.332 --> 14:17.160
- No, no.
We will take care of it.

14:17.204 --> 14:19.597
- You guys, I'm fine.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.338
It was a long time ago.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.645
People make mistakes.

14:23.688 --> 14:27.083
- I told myself, "Amber,
you give it six months,"

14:27.127 --> 14:30.043
and if acting is not
in the cards, then go home.

14:30.086 --> 14:34.177
I really wanted to be realistic
about my prospects, you know?

14:34.221 --> 14:37.224
I'm not saying I needed
to be Anne Hathaway famous,

14:37.267 --> 14:40.270
but I definitely
should have been

14:40.314 --> 14:43.839
John Krasinski's wife level.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.146
- Emily Blunt?

14:46.189 --> 14:47.756
- I don't know what that means.

14:49.410 --> 14:52.195
- What about the 5 grand
I gave you?

14:52.239 --> 14:54.981
- Acting classes
are so expensive.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.373
- Got any left?

14:56.417 --> 14:57.592
- Sorry.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.768
- I bet it goes fast out there.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.771
And I didn't want to take
a day job, you know?

15:02.814 --> 15:05.556
Like, I moved out there to act.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.603
Not wait tables, so...

15:11.258 --> 15:17.351
Mrs. Boland... I seriously
can't believe you're here.

15:17.394 --> 15:20.136
- I'm here.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.443
- I really owe you one.

15:22.486 --> 15:24.749
- How about 20?

15:24.793 --> 15:26.577
As in motor vehicles.

15:26.621 --> 15:29.276
- Yeah.
- What do you say?

15:29.319 --> 15:31.756
- For him, right?
- For me.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.716
- And we can pay cash.

15:36.457 --> 15:38.198
Look at that.
- Mm-hmm.

15:38.241 --> 15:41.418
- Cash... money.

15:41.462 --> 15:44.117
- I don't care about the money.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.683
- Look.

15:45.727 --> 15:48.730
What he did to both of us
is completely terrible

15:48.773 --> 15:51.602
and I can't excuse what he did.

15:51.646 --> 15:53.169
- Did you forgive him?

15:58.305 --> 15:59.697
- You know what?

16:01.308 --> 16:02.831
I think I did.

16:05.181 --> 16:06.574
- Well.

16:06.617 --> 16:08.706
You're a better person than me.

16:10.578 --> 16:12.275
I don't know, I just--

16:12.319 --> 16:15.713
I don't think I could just
forget all those times...

16:18.194 --> 16:22.068
- And when you say
all those times, Amber...

16:22.111 --> 16:24.026
- Nuh-uh.

16:24.070 --> 16:28.944
- Do you mean all those times
with one woman or...

16:30.467 --> 16:35.037
One time with all those women?

16:35.081 --> 16:41.087
- Or... all those times
with all those women.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.393
There's no good answer here.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.049
I'm so confused.

16:47.093 --> 16:52.315
- How many women did my husband
cheat on me with?

16:52.359 --> 16:53.838
- Um...

16:56.624 --> 16:58.843
Lifetime or per year?

16:58.887 --> 17:00.715
- It's not the damn census.

17:00.758 --> 17:03.022
- Oy vey.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.173
- Well, the good news is,
we got the cars.

17:24.217 --> 17:26.306
- Yay.

17:28.177 --> 17:30.179
- I mean, if you--

17:30.223 --> 17:35.532
if you know someone
is already... a cheater...

17:35.576 --> 17:37.404
- Does it make it
that much worse?

17:37.447 --> 17:40.102
- I don't know,
I'm just asking.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.017
- And it's not a love affair,
right?

17:42.061 --> 17:45.542
I mean, it's like a--
a preexisting condition.

17:45.586 --> 17:50.808
- And... is two worse than one?

17:50.852 --> 17:55.030
And is three worse than two?
Again, I have no clue.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.598
I'm here for you.
You don't have to answer.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.819
- It was just a warm body.

18:03.386 --> 18:04.996
Anyone but me.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.783
That makes it way worse.

18:10.654 --> 18:13.831
- Okay.
- Now we know.

18:16.878 --> 18:18.227
Stan.

18:18.271 --> 18:19.228
Hey.

18:19.272 --> 18:22.492
- Hey. Yeah, uh...

18:22.536 --> 18:24.842
I'm not gonna make it
to dinner.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.627
They tracked his phone.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.589
- That's a good thing, right?

18:32.633 --> 18:35.418
- Yeah, it took us--took us
to the lake just like you said.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.594
Then forensics backtracked us
to the Dumpster

18:37.638 --> 18:38.900
and that came up empty too.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.250
- Good, that's good.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.254
- What's up with the dogs?

18:48.649 --> 18:50.129
- We were so close.

18:50.172 --> 18:51.739
I mean, we were almost
out of there,

18:51.782 --> 18:53.610
but then they picked up
a scent.

18:57.005 --> 18:59.442
- Where are you, Stan?

18:59.486 --> 19:03.620
- And once they do that,
they don't stop, you know?

19:05.100 --> 19:06.884
They don't stop
until they find a body.

19:30.995 --> 19:33.781
- ♪ You and me

19:33.824 --> 19:38.089
♪ In time

19:38.133 --> 19:40.788
♪ You and me

19:40.831 --> 19:46.272
♪ In time

19:46.315 --> 19:49.623
♪ The river flows down

19:49.666 --> 19:53.148
♪ The flower grows up

19:53.192 --> 19:58.980

on the mountaintop ♪

19:59.023 --> 20:02.331
♪ You and me in time

20:02.375 --> 20:04.507
- Hey! You did it.

20:05.987 --> 20:08.381
How many?

20:08.424 --> 20:10.209
- You tell me, Dean.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.218
- Including Amber?

20:20.175 --> 20:21.568
- Why not?

20:25.006 --> 20:26.355
- Four.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.705
- Wow.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.665
- I love you.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.188
- Wow.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.670
I was pregnant.
I mean, I must have been.

20:36.713 --> 20:39.673
- With one of them.
I think. I don't remember.

20:39.716 --> 20:41.501
- Which one?

20:41.544 --> 20:44.025
- Why does it matter?
- Because it matters.

20:47.158 --> 20:48.421
Patty.

20:48.464 --> 20:51.685
- The flat-chested one
with no ass?

20:51.728 --> 20:54.383
- Yes.
- She looks like a little boy.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.255
- I don't know
how to respond to that.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.300
- Does that turn you on?

20:58.344 --> 20:59.606
- No.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.612
- Did you bring one home?
- What do you mean?

21:05.655 --> 21:07.309
- Did you do it here?
- Of course not.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.398
- Why not?
- I don't know.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.402
It's disrespectful.

21:17.014 --> 21:18.668
- How was the sex?

21:20.844 --> 21:22.672
- What is the point--
- Was it good?

21:22.716 --> 21:24.848
- What does it matter?
- Was it better?

21:27.286 --> 21:30.289
- I don't know.
It was...

21:30.332 --> 21:32.639
It was different.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.510
- Hmm.

21:34.554 --> 21:35.642
Hot.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.559
- Things weren't good
between us.

21:39.602 --> 21:41.735
- Apparently not.
- Since Jane, it was like you--

21:41.778 --> 21:44.477
- Don't even.
- You did not want me around.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.217
- You're gonna turn this around
on me?

21:46.261 --> 21:47.784
- No, I'm trying to explain it.

21:47.828 --> 21:49.351
- It's called depression.
- I know that.

21:49.395 --> 21:50.657
- It's hormonal, you dick.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.398
- We hadn't had sex
in two years.

21:52.441 --> 21:55.357
- That's not true!
- It is true!

21:55.401 --> 21:57.316
It is.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.931
What did you expect
would happen?

22:10.372 --> 22:12.331
- I'm gonna go feed the kids.

22:23.646 --> 22:26.127
- You going in early again?

22:26.170 --> 22:27.824
- Mm-hmm.

22:27.868 --> 22:29.522
First light.

22:29.565 --> 22:31.393
- How do we play this?

22:31.437 --> 22:33.787
- They're bringing in...

22:33.830 --> 22:36.833
officers from the eighth
and ninth to pitch in.

22:36.877 --> 22:40.489
- Jesus, Stan.
What are we gonna do?

22:48.367 --> 22:50.369
Put on "Below Deck Med."

22:51.674 --> 22:54.285
- What?
- Yeah, I'm behind.

22:54.329 --> 22:55.896
- You want to watch TV
right now?

22:55.939 --> 22:57.419
- Yeah, I want to see
if our boy Conrad

22:57.463 --> 22:58.638
is still with Hannah.

22:58.681 --> 23:00.204
You know, last time,
they were running

23:00.248 --> 23:02.032
a little hot and cold, so...

23:05.949 --> 23:08.604
- This isn't a grocery store.
- I know.

23:08.648 --> 23:11.172
- Or a bunch of fake cash.
- I know.

23:11.215 --> 23:13.000
- There is a body,
and they're going to find it.

23:13.043 --> 23:15.394
- I-I-I know!
I-I know.

23:16.830 --> 23:17.961
I know.

23:19.223 --> 23:20.660
I just can't.

23:21.878 --> 23:23.576
Not--not tonight.

23:24.838 --> 23:28.755
I just can't. Okay?
I cannot.

23:36.153 --> 23:37.503
- Well...

23:38.765 --> 23:41.115
You're not gonna believe
what Hannah did to our boy.

23:41.158 --> 23:43.073
- Yeah?

23:45.772 --> 23:47.469
- I don't play favorites.

23:47.513 --> 23:50.167
What I do reward
is initiative.

23:50.211 --> 23:51.691
- Morning.

23:51.734 --> 23:53.519
- In light of your
excellent work habits...

23:53.562 --> 23:54.868
- Yes.

24:01.527 --> 24:02.789
- Excuse me.

24:04.268 --> 24:07.358
Excuse me?
Ma'am?

24:07.402 --> 24:09.578
- You can't do that in here.

24:23.157 --> 24:25.072
- Oh, man.

24:25.115 --> 24:28.292
I was hoping you would rob
the place.

24:28.336 --> 24:30.077
- Guess I wasn't in the mood.

24:32.558 --> 24:35.909
I used to put vodka
in those in college.

24:35.952 --> 24:38.477
- Can I help you
with something?

24:38.520 --> 24:42.263
- Yeah, uh, do you bowl?
- What?

24:42.306 --> 24:45.135
Bowl. You know, the sport
with the funny shoes.

24:45.179 --> 24:46.963
- No.
- Hmm.

24:47.007 --> 24:48.443
Zumba?

24:48.487 --> 24:50.880
Maybe you garden.

24:50.924 --> 24:52.273
- I like to stay
out of the sun.

24:52.316 --> 24:53.709
- Ah.

24:53.753 --> 24:56.669
Well, there's something
there for everyone.

24:58.148 --> 25:01.064
- Where?
- Crystal Falls Correctional.

25:01.108 --> 25:02.849
- You won't even know
you're in prison.

25:02.892 --> 25:06.461
It's like
an all-inclusive cruise.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.767
- If you came here
to freak me out,

25:07.810 --> 25:09.508
I've already had a night.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.466
- No, I came here
to offer you a deal.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.251
I got a hundred guys
looking for a body

25:14.295 --> 25:15.644
with your name on it.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.475
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.824
- Mm.

25:21.868 --> 25:24.610
My source says you do.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.007
- Are you charging me
with something?

25:31.051 --> 25:33.793
- Not tonight.
- Then I'd like to go home.

25:33.836 --> 25:35.229
- When they find
the body, though,

25:35.272 --> 25:37.623
the bougie prison
will be taken off the table.

25:37.666 --> 25:43.629
It'll be Ionia Max,
which is... way less fun.

25:43.672 --> 25:45.326
- I don't know
who your source is,

25:45.369 --> 25:48.024
but they have no idea
what they're talking about.

25:48.068 --> 25:49.199
- No?

25:49.243 --> 25:52.551
- Lot of crazy out there.

25:54.596 --> 25:55.989
- Yeah, right?

26:41.208 --> 26:42.905
- Where we at?

26:44.559 --> 26:49.259
- Well, I did a deep dive
last night.

26:49.303 --> 26:53.263
Not prepared to label it,
but I ordered a bunch of stuff

26:53.307 --> 26:55.614
about sex addiction
to my Kindle.

26:55.657 --> 26:58.312
- I'm talking about
the cars, Dean.

26:58.355 --> 27:00.053
- Oh.

27:00.096 --> 27:01.184
- How many were sold?

27:01.228 --> 27:03.665
- With...

27:03.709 --> 27:06.842
Rick's Lincoln
and Linda unloading

27:06.886 --> 27:09.932
the Hyundai last night,
we're at--

27:09.976 --> 27:11.804
we're at two.

27:11.847 --> 27:14.720
- We have to sell
the rest today.

27:14.763 --> 27:16.939
- I can't move 20 cars
in a day.

27:16.983 --> 27:19.681
- We have to.
- We both can't steer the ship.

27:19.725 --> 27:21.640
You don't understand
the business.

27:21.683 --> 27:23.293
I mean, I know you think
you do, but it's--

27:23.337 --> 27:24.904
- They're gonna find a body.

27:27.776 --> 27:29.169
- Did you kill someone?

27:29.212 --> 27:31.127
- Not really.

27:31.171 --> 27:32.563
- Jesus, Beth.

27:32.607 --> 27:34.609
- But they're gonna pin it
on me.

27:38.744 --> 27:42.008
I don't have
any more time, Dean.

27:42.051 --> 27:43.618
- I would literally
have to give them away.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.186
- Okay, let's do that.

27:51.365 --> 27:53.367
- This is a $50,000 car.

27:56.370 --> 27:57.719
- ♪ One

27:57.763 --> 27:59.808

- What?
- What's up with your hair?

29:13.273 --> 29:16.667
- Nothing.
- It looks different.

29:16.711 --> 29:19.801
- Yeah, it's like, fluffy.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.586
- Bouncy, even.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.414
- It's called shampoo, guys.
I washed it.

29:24.458 --> 29:26.286
Okay.

29:26.329 --> 29:27.940
- Shampoo.

29:29.289 --> 29:30.899
- Yo.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.398
- What are you gonna do?

29:51.441 --> 29:53.356
- Uh, take care of it.

29:55.228 --> 29:57.796
- Buy off a cop
or a judge or something?

29:57.839 --> 29:59.885
- Yeah, you don't really
have to sweat the details.

29:59.928 --> 30:01.800
- Well, how will we know
if it worked?

30:01.843 --> 30:05.847
- If you don't get arrested,
it probably worked.

30:05.891 --> 30:08.807
- It's not really a plan.

30:11.810 --> 30:14.290
- You trust me?

30:14.334 --> 30:15.944
- God, no.

30:18.642 --> 30:20.122
- That's good.

30:28.478 --> 30:29.828
- What?

30:29.871 --> 30:33.309
- Oh... my... God.

30:33.353 --> 30:34.789
- What?

30:34.833 --> 30:36.835
- Oh, I think you know.

30:39.185 --> 30:40.708
- I don't need this
from you right now.

30:40.751 --> 30:41.840
- Oh-ho!

30:41.883 --> 30:43.319
I think you do.

30:47.889 --> 30:48.977
Hey, so just riddle me
this one.

30:49.021 --> 30:50.326
- You don't get to judge.

30:50.370 --> 30:51.501
- Picture if it was me,

30:51.545 --> 30:52.894
'cause you'd be so far
up my ass

30:52.938 --> 30:54.330
about the responsible choice

30:54.374 --> 30:57.203
and keeping it in my pants
and all that bull.

30:57.246 --> 30:59.335
- Dean slept
with half of Detroit.

30:59.379 --> 31:01.468
- Dude, I'm not saying that
you don't deserve to get some

31:01.511 --> 31:05.167
because you obviously do, but,
like, this isn't just some guy.

31:05.211 --> 31:08.214
Why would you drop
that steamy of a deuce, like,

31:08.257 --> 31:09.171
right where you eat?

31:09.215 --> 31:11.521
- What has gotten into you two?

31:11.565 --> 31:13.784
- Oh, I'll tell you
what's gotten into her.

31:13.828 --> 31:14.829
- Oh, come on, shut up.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.439
- Gang friend.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.793
- Don't look at me like that.

31:22.837 --> 31:24.012
- You know what?

31:24.056 --> 31:26.710
It actually makes
perfect sense.

31:26.754 --> 31:28.974
- I'm sorry.

31:29.017 --> 31:30.018
What?

31:30.062 --> 31:31.541
- It's why he gave you
the money.

31:31.585 --> 31:33.108
- That was before.

31:33.152 --> 31:35.197
- Yeah, and you've been, like,
big-timing us for weeks.

31:35.241 --> 31:37.547
- Come on.
- You're on a total power trip.

31:37.591 --> 31:38.897
- I am not!
- Yeah.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.507
You think you're like
the big boss now

31:40.550 --> 31:42.726
'cause your vagina got woke.

31:42.770 --> 31:45.033
- I mean...

31:45.077 --> 31:46.600
How was it?

31:46.643 --> 31:48.210
- You know what, Beth?

31:48.254 --> 31:50.169
You're actually a total liar.

31:50.212 --> 31:52.171
- And you're a truth teller?
- Was it good?

31:52.214 --> 31:53.999
- What's that supposed to mean?

31:54.042 --> 31:56.044
- It means you're screwing
a guy with a pregnant wife.

31:56.088 --> 31:58.917
- I ended that.
- When? Yesterday?

32:02.268 --> 32:05.488
- You know what?
Bone whoever you want.

32:05.532 --> 32:07.534
But I'm telling you right now,

32:07.577 --> 32:09.362
this is gonna end bad.

32:09.405 --> 32:10.885
For all of us.

32:28.598 --> 32:31.601
- Chill, dawg!
- I gotta go.

32:31.645 --> 32:32.994
- Yeah, oh, hey.

32:33.038 --> 32:36.563
Um, I made you these,
like, really weird

32:36.606 --> 32:39.827
sandwich kabob thingies
that I saw on Pinterest, so...

32:39.870 --> 32:41.916
- You were on Pinterest?
- Correct.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.396
It's kind of my jam now.

32:43.439 --> 32:45.572
- Weird, but thanks.

32:47.008 --> 32:49.576
- Cool it!
- I'm gonna be late.

32:49.619 --> 32:51.665
- Okay, uh, uh, well,
don't--don't forget,

32:51.708 --> 32:54.189
um, you have debate
after school.

32:54.233 --> 32:56.365
- I know.
- Uh...

32:56.409 --> 32:59.238
And, oh, I thought maybe later,
we could binge that documentary

32:59.281 --> 33:01.414
about the guy who pushed
his wife down the stairs.

33:01.457 --> 33:03.242
Can I have my bag?

33:06.897 --> 33:08.987
- What's going on?

33:12.381 --> 33:14.296
Well...

33:17.125 --> 33:20.476
I am the dick
who slept with your dad.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.261
- What?

33:22.304 --> 33:26.091
- I couldn't lie to you, like,
for one more second, you know?

33:26.134 --> 33:27.962
So...

33:28.006 --> 33:31.922
Look, I know this is--
it's really messed up.

33:31.966 --> 33:34.360
And it's really crazy, and I--

33:34.403 --> 33:36.971
I wish I could explain it
to you better,

33:37.015 --> 33:43.064
you know, but... it's just so--
so complicated.

33:43.108 --> 33:47.677
And believe me, I am not proud,
at all, you know?

33:47.721 --> 33:50.680
I totally admit that I am the--

33:50.724 --> 33:53.379
I am the king-size one.

33:53.422 --> 33:59.428
Of the... dicks from earlier.

34:02.866 --> 34:04.999
Honey, please say something.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.393
- I have to go to school.

34:07.436 --> 34:09.177
- Something else?

34:13.790 --> 34:17.403
- I want to stay
with Nancy tonight.

34:18.708 --> 34:20.145
- Okay.

34:28.457 --> 34:31.765
Oh, suck it!
Suck it!

34:45.909 --> 34:49.652
- Just got rid of
half my sales force.

34:49.696 --> 34:52.307
- There's nothing to sell,
anyway.

34:52.351 --> 34:54.831
- Burnt the whole thing
to the ground.

34:54.875 --> 34:58.487
- We did.

34:58.531 --> 34:59.880
- Is everything okay now?

34:59.923 --> 35:01.708
- I think so.

35:01.751 --> 35:04.798
- Well, then, I would do it
all over again.

35:07.888 --> 35:09.716
So now what?

35:13.241 --> 35:14.764
- We start over.

35:17.332 --> 35:21.075
I've been working
on your calendar.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.730
Emma has ballet Tuesday.
Thursday is swim.

35:23.773 --> 35:26.124
Cub Scouts is on Monday.
It's all here.

35:26.167 --> 35:27.995
Oh, and Friday
is early dismissal.

35:28.038 --> 35:30.171
You have to be there
exactly at noon.

35:30.215 --> 35:31.912
If you're even, like,
ten minutes late

35:31.955 --> 35:33.957
they charge you for aftercare.

35:34.001 --> 35:36.090
- Mm. Okay.
So wait.

35:36.134 --> 35:39.180
So you need me
to do all of that?

35:39.224 --> 35:41.922
- I do.

35:41.965 --> 35:45.491
- Where are you gonna be?

35:45.534 --> 35:48.276
- Here, at work.

35:50.757 --> 35:53.586
We can't both steer the ship.

36:03.944 --> 36:07.817
- What's your favorite donut?
- A free one.

36:07.861 --> 36:11.430
- Rotary club
forgot their glazed.

36:11.473 --> 36:12.692
Is that "Nemo" again?

36:12.735 --> 36:14.781
I cannot watch that movie
one more time.

36:14.824 --> 36:16.826
And when they get scared
at the same part,

36:16.870 --> 36:18.480
that's all you, okay?

36:18.524 --> 36:20.874
I'm so sick of that damn fish.

36:23.703 --> 36:26.749
- There's no body.

36:26.793 --> 36:28.229
- What?

36:28.273 --> 36:31.928
- We searched every inch
of that dump.

36:31.972 --> 36:34.017
- That's impossible.

36:34.061 --> 36:37.847
- It's over.
They called it.

36:37.891 --> 36:40.415
- We threw that boy away, Stan.

36:40.459 --> 36:43.026
- Well...

36:43.070 --> 36:46.769
Then we got somebody
looking after us.

36:46.813 --> 36:49.250
- Yeah, we do.

37:00.696 --> 37:03.003
- Call now
before this deal expires.

37:03.046 --> 37:04.483
- You enjoying this?

37:04.526 --> 37:06.398
Is this fun for you?
- What're you talking about?

37:06.441 --> 37:08.661
- Having a hundred guys sift
through a bunch of garbage.

37:08.704 --> 37:10.271
"They C-H-O-P-P'ed him up."

37:10.315 --> 37:12.708
- They did.
- With a machete, no less.

37:12.752 --> 37:14.232
Where do you buy
those from now, huh?

37:14.275 --> 37:15.494
Walmart?

37:15.537 --> 37:17.974
- I saw them, okay?
- In your home, right?

37:18.018 --> 37:19.802
- Yeah.
- In your freezer.

37:19.846 --> 37:21.326
Maybe you did it.

37:23.458 --> 37:28.071
- I just need to, like, shower
and sleep for a hundred years.

37:29.464 --> 37:31.771
- I want you out.
No more staying ahead of it.

37:31.814 --> 37:33.294
No more pen caps.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.340
I want you to stay clean of it
from now on.

37:35.383 --> 37:37.211
- Ruby.
- There's no saving my soul.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.560
I'm already going to hell.

37:38.604 --> 37:40.649
Someone's gotta stay here
and raise these kids.

37:40.693 --> 37:42.260
- Don't you get it, boo?

37:42.303 --> 37:45.698
- You're done.
You hear me?

37:45.741 --> 37:49.049
- Wherever you go, I go too.

37:49.092 --> 37:51.791
- It's the scary part!

37:51.834 --> 37:53.880
- Damn sharks.

37:53.923 --> 37:56.056
- I'm not playing
with you, okay?

37:56.099 --> 37:57.840
- I don't know
what you want from me.

37:57.884 --> 38:00.408
- Give me something I can use.
- I told you everything I know!

38:00.452 --> 38:03.106
- Then why isn't there a body?
- I don't know!

38:03.150 --> 38:04.978
Okay, maybe your guys
missed it or--

38:05.021 --> 38:06.458
or--or maybe someone took it.

38:06.501 --> 38:08.242
- How do you think somebody
even takes a body?

38:08.286 --> 38:09.591
How does that even happen?

38:09.635 --> 38:11.245
- I don't know!
- Maybe Jesus came down.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.378
Or the tooth fairy.
It's a landfill, all right?

38:13.421 --> 38:15.989
It's guarded 24/7.
You know what?

38:16.032 --> 38:18.687
Pack your kids up.
I'm booking you tonight.

38:20.341 --> 38:22.169
- One of them's married
to a cop.

38:43.712 --> 38:45.410
- Check out this ride, baby.

38:45.453 --> 38:47.890
The paint sparkles
like your eyes.

38:49.675 --> 38:54.680
- Ladies, are you tired
of being hit on, lied to,

38:54.723 --> 38:58.727
or ignored every time
you try and buy a car?

38:58.771 --> 39:02.601
Then come on down to the new
and improved Boland motors,

39:02.644 --> 39:06.561
where we have on-site daycare
while you shop.

39:06.605 --> 39:11.044
Imported teas and coffees
from around the world.

39:11.087 --> 39:14.003
Free car seat installation.

39:14.047 --> 39:17.355
But most important,
our flexible hours

39:17.398 --> 39:19.618
will suit any woman's schedule,

39:19.661 --> 39:23.970
whether you're stuck at home
or stuck in the boardroom.

Let's take five, everyone.

39:46.166 --> 39:48.516
- I don't know what to do
with my hands.

39:48.560 --> 39:52.259
- Mrs. Boland, I think
your business partner is here.

39:58.961 --> 40:00.615
- Thank you.

40:04.880 --> 40:07.622
You can't tell people
you're my business partner.

40:07.666 --> 40:11.147
- No? What do you want
to call this, then?

40:11.191 --> 40:13.498
- Let's just not
label it, okay?

40:13.541 --> 40:17.545
- Yeah, yeah, you're right.
It is kind of early, huh?

40:21.070 --> 40:24.204
So I got your trash bag
for you.

40:29.252 --> 40:32.081
- Where'd you dump it?
- Nowhere.

40:33.561 --> 40:36.477
Yeah, I figured I'd hold on
to it for a bit.

40:36.521 --> 40:38.697
Just to be safe.

40:38.740 --> 40:41.308
One man's trash...

40:42.614 --> 40:45.443
- Who are you protecting?
You or me?

40:47.445 --> 40:50.448
- Let's just see
how all this goes, yeah?

40:50.491 --> 40:52.232
- Ready, Mrs. Boland?

40:52.275 --> 40:54.887
