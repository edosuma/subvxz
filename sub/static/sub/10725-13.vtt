00:00.862 --> 00:02.491
Over 68 million Americans

00:02.492 --> 00:04.781
leave the safety of
our borders every year.

00:04.782 --> 00:06.281
If danger strikes,

00:06.282 --> 00:08.531
the FBI's international response team

00:08.532 --> 00:10.882
is called into action.

00:27.559 --> 00:29.308
Slow down, girls! Relantir!

00:29.309 --> 00:30.848
No, Mama, we're racing!

00:30.849 --> 00:32.848
Shh! It's late. Go. Go.

00:32.849 --> 00:34.228
Come on, Abby.

00:34.229 --> 00:36.372
They haven't gone to bed
before 10:00 this whole trip.

00:36.373 --> 00:37.188
Can you blame them?

00:37.189 --> 00:38.188
They're excited to
have a little brother.

00:38.189 --> 00:39.728
I know. They really do adore him.

00:39.729 --> 00:41.768
Did you see how Samuel
wouldn't go to sleep

00:41.769 --> 00:43.688
till he kissed them both good night?

00:43.689 --> 00:44.818
It was so sweet.

00:44.843 --> 00:46.746
I wish the orphanage
would let him stay with us.

00:46.747 --> 00:47.592
I know.

00:47.593 --> 00:49.092
Just two more days, and
then he'll be ours forever.

00:49.093 --> 00:50.222
Can you believe it?

00:50.223 --> 00:51.722
Hmm.

00:51.723 --> 00:52.802
"LumiÃ¨re."

00:52.803 --> 00:53.923
"LumiÃ¨re."

00:53.924 --> 00:55.427
Shut up.

00:55.428 --> 00:56.052
"Peinture."

00:56.053 --> 00:57.172
"Peinture."

00:58.593 --> 00:59.552
What?

00:59.553 --> 01:00.552
I don't know.

01:02.757 --> 01:04.666
Sam's little accent
is amazing, isn't it?

01:04.667 --> 01:06.086
I wish he could hold onto it,

01:06.087 --> 01:08.626
but he'll probably lose it
once we get him into school.

01:08.627 --> 01:10.046
Which is why it's so important

01:10.047 --> 01:11.756
for us to always remind him of that.

01:11.757 --> 01:13.700
French and creole is part
of Samuel's foundation,

01:13.701 --> 01:15.166
and I want to honor it.

01:15.167 --> 01:16.506
So can we come back every year?

01:16.507 --> 01:18.357
Yes.

01:22.507 --> 01:24.426
I love you, Mrs. Wagner.

01:24.427 --> 01:26.796
You're not so bad yourself.

01:29.667 --> 01:30.666
I won!

01:30.667 --> 01:31.586
What?!

01:31.587 --> 01:32.966
- No, you didn't!
- Yes, I did!

01:32.967 --> 01:35.296
Oh, no. Another tie.

01:35.297 --> 01:37.506
Sorry, girls. Gonna have
to wait till tomorrow.

01:37.507 --> 01:39.666
Are your allergies
still bothering you, boo?

01:39.667 --> 01:40.666
Yeah.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.067
Mm. Come here.

01:46.547 --> 01:48.626
Ah. Good.

01:48.627 --> 01:50.426
You all right?

01:50.427 --> 01:52.166
Come on, Abby.

01:52.167 --> 01:53.666
Bonne nuit, Papa.

01:53.667 --> 01:55.546
Mm. Good night, my beauties.

01:55.547 --> 01:57.166
Good night.

01:57.167 --> 01:58.966
Feel better, okay?

01:58.967 --> 02:00.216
Good night.

02:00.217 --> 02:01.256
Night, Mama.

02:01.257 --> 02:02.666
Tomorrow's a big day.

02:02.667 --> 02:03.926
Yes, it is.

02:03.927 --> 02:05.666
Go to sleep, guys. No chitchat.

02:05.667 --> 02:06.437
Okay.

02:08.627 --> 02:10.716
I love you to the moon and back.

02:10.717 --> 02:12.817
Love you, too, Mama.

03:01.047 --> 03:03.256
Oh, I cannot believe we ate all that.

03:03.257 --> 03:05.666
Yeah, well, who knew
that Monty's grandma

03:05.667 --> 03:07.216
has a dozen signature dishes?

03:07.217 --> 03:08.337
It's just a little something

03:08.338 --> 03:09.881
from every country that we've been to.

03:09.882 --> 03:12.086
God, she is so sweet.
We're gonna hurt tomorrow.

03:12.967 --> 03:14.966
Really, you guys?

03:14.967 --> 03:17.796
A little help here?

03:17.797 --> 03:19.426
The soap's right...

03:19.427 --> 03:21.387
Yeah, all right, at your
service, at your service.

03:21.388 --> 03:23.057
Okay, okay, okay. You wash. We will dry.

03:23.058 --> 03:24.767
- No, really. Relax.
- Grab a towel.

03:26.007 --> 03:28.506
Daddy, can you tell me a story?

03:28.507 --> 03:31.966
Okay. Has to be a quick one.

03:31.967 --> 03:33.756
About the dragon.

03:33.757 --> 03:36.876
About the dragon, about the dragon.

03:36.877 --> 03:38.836
All right, where did I leave off?

03:38.837 --> 03:40.666
He was alone in the forest.

03:40.667 --> 03:42.466
And he couldn't find his family, right?

03:42.467 --> 03:44.506
Right. He was scared.

03:44.507 --> 03:46.666
But that is when he
found another dragon,

03:46.667 --> 03:50.046
and they bought a little
dragon house together.

03:50.047 --> 03:52.666
And they had dragon food.

03:52.667 --> 03:55.716
I'm pretty sure you're
gonna need a little more

03:55.717 --> 03:57.626
garnet and gold in your wardrobe.

03:57.627 --> 04:00.086
That's Florida state, Dad.
USC's cardinal and gold.

04:00.087 --> 04:02.376
Yeah, and it's a lot farther away.

04:02.377 --> 04:04.336
Says the man who travels the globe.

04:04.337 --> 04:08.466
It's not like I'm the first
kid you've sent to college.

04:08.467 --> 04:11.296
That's the problem. I
know what comes next.

04:11.297 --> 04:12.586
The bill?

04:12.587 --> 04:13.926
No, no.

04:13.927 --> 04:17.397
It's just gonna be a
little quieter around here.

04:19.966 --> 04:23.506
I'm sorry I'm going so far away.

04:25.087 --> 04:27.716
Your mom and I just
want you to be happy.

04:27.717 --> 04:29.216
I am.

04:29.217 --> 04:30.666
Friday night, we'll celebrate.

04:30.667 --> 04:32.926
As long as Dad doesn't
have to save the world.

04:32.927 --> 04:34.166
Oh, this party's happening.

04:34.167 --> 04:35.466
He'll be here, right, Jack?

04:35.467 --> 04:38.216
I wouldn't miss it.

04:38.217 --> 04:40.466
All right, I'm gonna hit it.

04:40.467 --> 04:43.267
See you in the morning.

04:46.627 --> 04:49.046
It wasn't this hard with the boys.

04:49.047 --> 04:53.216
We've got two left before
we're empty-nesters.

04:53.217 --> 04:56.567
That's unchartered territory
for Unit Chief Garrett.

04:58.217 --> 05:01.046
It's late. This can wait till tomorrow.

05:01.047 --> 05:02.836
No. I'm almost done.

05:02.837 --> 05:04.466
Okay.

05:04.467 --> 05:07.437
I'm going to bed.

05:09.047 --> 05:10.857
I'll be up in a minute.

05:44.757 --> 05:49.527
Jack, we need you and the rest
of the IRT back at base asap.

05:52.717 --> 05:54.756
Let's get everyone up to speed, Monty.

05:54.757 --> 05:57.376
As you know, the Wagners
woke up two hours ago

05:57.377 --> 05:58.926
to a complete nightmare.

05:58.927 --> 06:03.046
4-year-old Abby was taken
from their hotel room in Haiti.

06:03.047 --> 06:05.166
That's not exactly a
popular vacation spot.

06:05.167 --> 06:06.796
For the Wagners, it is.

06:06.797 --> 06:08.926
Owen and Emily have done
outreach programs down there

06:08.927 --> 06:10.506
for the last decade,

06:10.507 --> 06:14.126
but this trip was to adopt
a 2-year-old named Samuel.

06:14.127 --> 06:15.966
- Was there a ransom note?
- Nothing.

06:15.967 --> 06:17.876
That's unusual in
poverty-stricken nations.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.546
Usually they want a fast payout.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.006
Unless they want something bigger

06:21.007 --> 06:22.586
than the family could provide.

06:22.587 --> 06:24.506
Yeah, like trafficking,
which was rampant

06:24.507 --> 06:26.666
among the local children
since the earthquake,

06:26.667 --> 06:28.426
but very rare among foreign visitors.

06:28.427 --> 06:30.926
It's rare, but it
happens. What's the window?

06:30.927 --> 06:32.296
Eight hours.

06:32.297 --> 06:33.796
The family went to bed after 10:00.

06:33.797 --> 06:35.256
When they woke up at 6:00, she was gone.

06:35.257 --> 06:36.426
We need to narrow that down.

06:36.427 --> 06:38.166
Well, the unsub probably
waited a few hours

06:38.167 --> 06:39.796
to guarantee that everyone was sleeping.

06:39.797 --> 06:41.716
Agreed. Even the most exhausted parents

06:41.717 --> 06:43.006
may not fall asleep right away,

06:43.007 --> 06:44.876
so we should look at a 12:00 midnight,

06:44.877 --> 06:46.216
1:00 A.M. at the earliest.

06:46.217 --> 06:47.876
That takes us down to a
five or six, which is better,

06:47.877 --> 06:49.860
but still gives our offender
a massive head start.

06:49.861 --> 06:51.426
And they've vanished in a country

06:51.427 --> 06:52.876
that's not equipped for this.

06:52.877 --> 06:55.166
Simmons, call your contacts
for a search and rescue.

06:55.167 --> 06:56.836
Any hotel surveillance?

06:56.837 --> 06:59.716
Not enough. They've
only got five cameras.

06:59.717 --> 07:00.940
We need a map of the property.

07:00.941 --> 07:02.216
Sending now.

07:02.217 --> 07:03.800
How long have the Wagners been in Haiti?

07:03.801 --> 07:05.926
Uh, 12 days.

07:05.927 --> 07:07.796
That's long enough to establish patterns

07:07.797 --> 07:09.376
and put them on our unsub's radar.

07:09.377 --> 07:11.716
Yeah, and a young,
healthy American family's

07:11.717 --> 07:12.926
gonna stick out there.

07:12.927 --> 07:15.086
We'll head directly to the Wagners

07:15.087 --> 07:16.836
and meet the local officer.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.296
We need to get as much
information as possible

07:19.297 --> 07:21.216
before the media gets ahold of this.

07:21.217 --> 07:22.926
Yeah, a beautiful
American child missing?

07:22.927 --> 07:24.836
The media's gonna have
a field day with that.

07:24.837 --> 07:26.836
The Wagners were in Haiti
to make a difference.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.926
We're not about to let
this end in tragedy.

07:35.877 --> 07:39.977

"Beyond the mountains,

08:03.289 --> 08:05.219
Haitian proverb.

08:14.329 --> 08:16.788
Ah. Welcome.

08:16.789 --> 08:18.828
Inspector General Brasier.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.328
Unit chief Jack
Garrett. This is my team.

08:22.329 --> 08:24.288
Great. Thank you all for coming so fast.

08:24.289 --> 08:25.209
The Wagners are inside.

08:25.210 --> 08:26.473
Wait. Did they make those?

08:26.474 --> 08:27.498
Yes.

08:27.499 --> 08:29.618
They haven't wasted much
time since she's been gone.

08:29.619 --> 08:31.618
They keep mentioning a
case about a Madeline?

08:31.619 --> 08:33.957
Madeline McCann was almost her age

08:33.958 --> 08:36.288
when she was abducted in Portugal.

08:36.289 --> 08:37.707
When was this?

08:37.708 --> 08:38.748
2007.

08:38.749 --> 08:40.248
And what happened to her?

08:40.249 --> 08:41.707
No one knows. She was never found.

08:41.708 --> 08:44.668
The question, then, again
is why risk taking a child

08:44.669 --> 08:45.788
that stands out?

08:45.789 --> 08:48.208
Well, Haitians taking Haitian children

08:48.209 --> 08:49.578
happens out in the open.

08:49.579 --> 08:51.458
Bad men go to rural villages

08:51.459 --> 08:52.958
and sometimes convince the parents

08:52.959 --> 08:54.618
to send their children to school,

08:54.619 --> 08:56.562
but those parents never
see their children again.

08:56.563 --> 08:59.498
Yeah. They, uh... They're
called paper orphans.

08:59.499 --> 09:01.458
It's happening in Nepal, as well.

09:01.459 --> 09:04.498
Documents are forged saying that
they have no living relatives.

09:04.499 --> 09:06.602
Sometimes they're even
adopted by unknowing families.

09:06.603 --> 09:08.878
Then maybe they're trying
to send the Wagners a message

09:08.879 --> 09:10.458
because they were here to adopt.

09:10.459 --> 09:12.668
That seems like a huge risk
for a personal vendetta.

09:12.669 --> 09:13.618
Come.

09:13.619 --> 09:14.998
Abby was taken from her room.

09:14.999 --> 09:16.038
Do you think it's somebody
who works at the hotel?

09:16.039 --> 09:17.918
Do you have any suspects?

09:17.919 --> 09:19.498
No comment.

09:19.499 --> 09:21.208
The Wagners made these flyers,
but they haven't talked to us.

09:21.209 --> 09:22.328
No comment.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.872
You think they have something to hide?

09:23.873 --> 09:25.183
Are you the FBI's IRT?

09:27.419 --> 09:29.878
The press have been at it all morning.

09:29.879 --> 09:31.248
They're vultures.

09:31.249 --> 09:32.708
We'll handle them.

09:32.709 --> 09:35.618
My name's Jack Garrett,
and this is my team...

09:35.619 --> 09:38.498
Agents Seger, Jarvis, and Simmons.

09:38.499 --> 09:42.429
Owen Wagner. Um, Emily and Grace.

09:46.079 --> 09:47.958
When was this photo taken?

09:47.959 --> 09:49.118
Yesterday.

09:49.119 --> 09:50.498
We passed them out to everyone.

09:50.499 --> 09:52.378
We couldn't just sit still.

09:52.379 --> 09:54.708
I understand. No one can.

09:54.709 --> 09:56.748
We tasked people while
we were in flight.

09:56.749 --> 09:58.538
We've had all vehicles searched

09:58.539 --> 10:00.878
in and out of Port-Au-Prince
for the past two hours.

10:00.879 --> 10:03.078
We'll continue that
until our investigation

10:03.079 --> 10:04.248
gives us more specifics.

10:04.249 --> 10:05.998
General, I need all the security footage

10:05.999 --> 10:07.418
from the hotel and city.

10:07.419 --> 10:09.748
Ah, the earthquake took
out all the traffic cameras,

10:09.749 --> 10:11.708
but the hotel has
their footage pulled up.

10:11.709 --> 10:13.329
I'll want eyes on that, too.

10:13.330 --> 10:14.810
Where are we with employee interviews

10:14.811 --> 10:15.714
and background checks?

10:15.715 --> 10:17.878
Ah, no one is standing out.

10:17.879 --> 10:19.538
I can't believe that Abby's gone,

10:19.539 --> 10:20.828
and... and no one saw anything?

10:20.829 --> 10:22.618
It has to be someone who works here.

10:22.619 --> 10:25.208
We don't want to jump
to any conclusions,

10:25.209 --> 10:29.038
but I can assure you we'll
leave no stone unturned.

10:29.039 --> 10:33.208
Agent Simmons has search and
rescue here to assist him.

10:33.209 --> 10:35.618
I'm, uh... I'm gonna
need something of Abby's

10:35.619 --> 10:37.668
for the search team.

10:37.669 --> 10:40.418
Her, um, blanket and stuffed
elephant must be with her

10:40.419 --> 10:42.708
because we can't find them in the room.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.878
What about what she
was wearing yesterday?

10:44.879 --> 10:48.618
Uh, her sweatshirt. I'll get it.

10:48.619 --> 10:51.099
I'll go with you.

10:57.289 --> 11:00.059
When these kinds of things
happen to other people...

11:01.999 --> 11:03.958
kids usually aren't found.

11:03.959 --> 11:06.668
You know, just when I can't
imagine a bigger nightmare,

11:06.669 --> 11:10.118
I start worrying about...
Child trafficking.

11:10.119 --> 11:13.458
And if Abby was taken
by somebody like that,

11:13.459 --> 11:15.559
then she could be hundreds
of miles away right now.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.458
Agent Simmons, I'd like to join you.

11:19.459 --> 11:21.998
You know, actually, uh, I was hoping

11:21.999 --> 11:24.168
that you could help me
retrace your family's steps

11:24.169 --> 11:26.269
from the orphanage to
the hotel last night.

11:27.829 --> 11:29.748
Okay. I can do that.

11:29.749 --> 11:31.328
Great. Let's go this way.

11:31.329 --> 11:33.309
We'll avoid the madness.

11:35.669 --> 11:38.078
He's right, isn't he?

11:38.079 --> 11:39.979
This feels like an organized abduction.

11:53.539 --> 11:55.498
She loves this one.

11:55.499 --> 11:58.389
Thank you.

12:05.619 --> 12:09.248
Lamp is "lumiÃ¨re," and book is "livre."

12:09.249 --> 12:11.118
You are doing so good.

12:11.119 --> 12:12.168
Merci.

12:14.289 --> 12:16.748
When is Abby gonna come back?

12:16.749 --> 12:19.828
Well, we are here to help find her.

12:19.829 --> 12:22.118
Why would somebody take her?

12:22.119 --> 12:24.429
She doesn't belong to them.

12:25.959 --> 12:28.118
Mama, you need a hug?

12:28.119 --> 12:30.019
Yeah.

12:32.709 --> 12:34.668
Ooh, that's a good squeeze.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.708
Thank you.

12:37.709 --> 12:39.038
Can I watch something?

12:39.039 --> 12:40.099
Yeah.

12:48.829 --> 12:50.918
It's all my fault.

12:50.919 --> 12:52.328
No.

12:52.329 --> 12:53.498
I lost my key.

12:53.499 --> 12:55.458
Someone must have
used it to get in here.

12:55.459 --> 12:56.498
It's the only way.

12:56.499 --> 12:58.139
I can't find my key.

13:01.789 --> 13:03.538
We haven't determined that yet.

13:03.539 --> 13:05.208
The room is still being processed.

13:05.209 --> 13:07.208
I always wake up...

13:07.209 --> 13:08.828
Ever since Grace was born.

13:08.829 --> 13:12.288
I think it's instinctual. I
wake up at least once a night.

13:12.289 --> 13:15.418
But last night, I slept through,

13:15.419 --> 13:16.828
and now my baby's gone.

13:16.829 --> 13:19.418
Hey, hey, hey, this is
not your fault, okay?

13:19.419 --> 13:20.828
It's not.

13:20.829 --> 13:24.288
I keep wondering, "why
didn't Abby wake up or cry?"

13:24.289 --> 13:27.578
It's because I gave her the
medicine for her allergies

13:27.579 --> 13:29.538
and she was just sound asleep.

13:29.539 --> 13:31.378
What did you give her?

13:33.959 --> 13:35.849
It was right here.

13:38.879 --> 13:40.668
Did they take it with them?

13:40.669 --> 13:42.679
Wh-wh-why would
they do that?

13:44.289 --> 13:45.748
Well, it could be to look after her.

13:45.749 --> 13:50.059
And if she's asleep, then
she's not scared, right?

13:51.749 --> 13:53.288
Mom?

13:54.289 --> 13:55.828
I need some help.

13:55.829 --> 13:57.849
Yeah. Yeah.

13:59.919 --> 14:02.179
Oh. So, here we go.

14:05.919 --> 14:07.288
I have children.

14:07.289 --> 14:09.918
This is my biggest nightmare.

14:09.919 --> 14:13.668
The answers are here. We
just haven't found them yet.

14:14.539 --> 14:15.708
Well, we checked.

14:15.709 --> 14:17.538
There's no unlocked windows,

14:17.539 --> 14:19.458
loose vents, or forced entry.

14:19.459 --> 14:22.019
There's also no extra security.

14:23.789 --> 14:27.078
Emily said that she lost her key.

14:27.079 --> 14:29.498
If it was stolen, then
that means that the offender

14:29.499 --> 14:31.998
was close enough to the
family to access Emily's bag.

14:31.999 --> 14:34.328
The door beeps when it's unlocked.

14:34.329 --> 14:36.078
Don't you think that would be too loud

14:36.079 --> 14:37.328
in the middle of the night?

14:37.329 --> 14:38.719
Yeah.

14:40.249 --> 14:41.828
So, what if someone came in

14:41.829 --> 14:43.788
while the family was
still at the orphanage?

14:43.789 --> 14:45.918
They would have laid in wait for hours

14:45.919 --> 14:47.168
until everyone fell asleep.

14:47.169 --> 14:49.998
I mean, it's extreme,
but so is taking Abby.

14:49.999 --> 14:52.828
Where would they hide?

14:52.829 --> 14:54.998
Ah.

14:56.879 --> 14:59.559
No one could fit under here.

15:03.039 --> 15:05.059
They could in here.

15:06.919 --> 15:09.498
That takes a lot of patience.

15:09.499 --> 15:11.038
Yeah, and it's bold.

15:11.039 --> 15:12.702
What if the Wagners
had opened the closet?

15:12.703 --> 15:15.463
I want your officers to
focus on prints in here.

15:17.169 --> 15:20.918
Then Emily and I met here back in 2004.

15:20.919 --> 15:23.288
We were both part of an aid program

15:23.289 --> 15:24.918
after hurricane Jeanne hit.

15:24.919 --> 15:27.918
And that's when we fell
in love with the country,

15:27.919 --> 15:29.418
the... hey.

15:29.419 --> 15:30.828
Ah. Bonsoir.

15:30.829 --> 15:33.458
The culture, the strength of the people.

15:33.459 --> 15:35.118
Well, it's the second nation to America

15:35.119 --> 15:36.378
to gain their independence.

15:36.379 --> 15:37.788
Right.

15:37.789 --> 15:40.418
We always knew that we
wanted to expand our family,

15:40.419 --> 15:43.418
but for years out-of-country
adoptions were illegal here.

15:43.419 --> 15:45.208
But after the 2010 quake,

15:45.209 --> 15:46.958
there were so many orphaned children,

15:46.959 --> 15:48.302
they really didn't have a choice.

15:48.303 --> 15:50.168
You know, it's a beautiful thing,

15:50.169 --> 15:51.618
what your family's doing.

15:51.619 --> 15:55.748
Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa!

15:55.749 --> 15:57.889
Samuel!

16:00.209 --> 16:04.538
I heard about Abby. This is awful.

16:04.539 --> 16:07.918
Um, I need a complete list of
all employees and volunteers,

16:07.919 --> 16:10.288
past and present, anybody
who had access to the family.

16:10.289 --> 16:12.078
General Brasier called ahead.

16:12.079 --> 16:13.578
I've already got it for you.

16:13.579 --> 16:15.078
Oh, thank you.

16:15.079 --> 16:16.078
And just to confirm...

16:16.079 --> 16:17.788
Samuel had no living relatives,

16:17.789 --> 16:19.248
no aunts, uncles, siblings,

16:19.249 --> 16:21.998
anybody who'd want to punish
the Wagners for adopting him?

16:21.999 --> 16:24.038
Samuel is not a paper orphan.

16:24.039 --> 16:25.248
I knew his parents,

16:25.249 --> 16:28.078
and sadly they died
of cholera a year ago.

16:28.079 --> 16:29.288
He was the only one spared.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.168
- Leila, Leila!
- Ah, pardon.

16:31.169 --> 16:33.918
Merci.

16:33.919 --> 16:36.498
There are no cameras
near the Wagners' room,

16:36.499 --> 16:38.828
but I'm piecing together what I can.

16:38.829 --> 16:39.998
Is anything standing out?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.309
Not yet.

16:44.959 --> 16:47.168
Doesn't look like
they're wearing a uniform.

16:47.169 --> 16:49.458
Employees have all been cleared...

16:49.459 --> 16:52.498
So this could be an outside vendor.

16:52.499 --> 16:54.139
Oh, my God.

16:56.669 --> 16:58.519
That has to be Abby.

17:07.878 --> 17:09.248
What's up, Jack?

17:09.249 --> 17:12.708
The unsub left the hotel
grounds with Abby at 1:49 A.M.

17:12.709 --> 17:14.038
They were on foot.

17:14.039 --> 17:15.982
Calculate how far they
could have gotten by now.

17:15.983 --> 17:16.877
On it.

17:16.878 --> 17:18.328
And since all the employees checked out,

17:18.329 --> 17:20.417
we need to broaden our search
to every independent vendor

17:20.419 --> 17:21.917
who would have known this property.

17:21.919 --> 17:24.038
Uh, compiling a list now.
I'll hit you guys back.

17:24.999 --> 17:26.098
Clara.

17:28.079 --> 17:30.519
We got a lead.

17:34.289 --> 17:36.168
Hey, I was just gonna call you.

17:36.169 --> 17:37.288
What have you got?

17:37.289 --> 17:39.038
We picked up the trail
outside the hotel.

17:39.039 --> 17:41.998
The dogs led us about two
miles north of the city.

17:41.999 --> 17:43.458
It's a gang-infested area.

17:43.459 --> 17:45.122
It could have been
used as a meeting point

17:45.123 --> 17:46.828
if we're still talking
about trafficking.

17:46.829 --> 17:48.458
According to the surveillance video,

17:48.459 --> 17:50.168
they snuck her out of the hotel.

17:51.419 --> 17:52.418
What's going on?

17:52.419 --> 17:54.578
Hold on.

17:58.579 --> 18:00.179
Clear! Clear!

18:02.289 --> 18:03.958
FBI!

18:11.579 --> 18:13.208
Hey. Get them back.

18:16.579 --> 18:18.288
Hey, Jack.

18:18.289 --> 18:20.599
Found Abby's stuffed elephant.

18:22.039 --> 18:24.139
She was here, but she's gone.

18:35.579 --> 18:38.328
And, Jack...

18:38.329 --> 18:39.429
We've got blood.

18:52.940 --> 18:53.681
Not human blood.

18:54.078 --> 18:56.039
That's a relief, but
there's a lot of it.

18:56.123 --> 18:57.502
We need to find the source.

18:57.502 --> 18:58.831
The dogs are searching the area.

18:58.832 --> 19:01.081
These unsubs have a
million places to hide.

19:01.082 --> 19:03.791
Why would they stop just two
miles from the abduction zone?

19:03.792 --> 19:05.041
What's in this area?

19:05.042 --> 19:06.825
It's run by gangs who
deal in drugs and guns,

19:06.826 --> 19:08.251
not children.

19:08.252 --> 19:10.251
This is beginning to feel a lot
less organized than we thought.

19:10.252 --> 19:11.371
Leaving the toy behind,

19:11.372 --> 19:12.955
stopping so close to the abduction site

19:12.956 --> 19:14.911
doesn't add up to someone
who's done this before.

19:14.912 --> 19:17.081
Exactly. It wasn't well-planned.

19:17.082 --> 19:18.251
They just disappeared on foot

19:18.252 --> 19:20.371
and needed to rest
before walking off again.

19:20.372 --> 19:22.961
But why this particular
place and not another shelter?

19:22.962 --> 19:24.505
The offender's telling us a lot.

19:24.506 --> 19:26.661
First they waited in a closet

19:26.662 --> 19:29.701
and then calmly walked
Abby off the property.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.411
There's patience, despite the risk.

19:31.412 --> 19:33.791
When Abby's arm slipped
out of the linens,

19:33.792 --> 19:35.621
it didn't even faze the offender.

19:35.622 --> 19:39.081
They just tucked her
back in... lovingly, even.

19:39.083 --> 19:41.752
Well, they brought along
Abby's medicine, blanket,

19:41.753 --> 19:44.252
stuffed animal, almost like
they were comforting her.

19:44.253 --> 19:46.162
The unsub could be a mother.

19:46.163 --> 19:47.872
Predisposed female.

19:47.873 --> 19:49.292
That's never good.

19:49.293 --> 19:51.462
Abby and this place
must hold some sort of...

19:51.463 --> 19:53.202
Emotional significance.

20:06.163 --> 20:09.263
A pauper's grave.

20:10.623 --> 20:12.162
This dirt hasn't been disturbed.

20:12.163 --> 20:13.462
There's no way Abby's in there.

20:13.463 --> 20:14.252
That's her blanket.

20:14.253 --> 20:16.502
It's unmarked.

20:16.503 --> 20:19.662
This area has seen
flooding and much disease.

20:19.663 --> 20:21.162
Could be anyone.

20:21.163 --> 20:24.332
Well, whoever's in there may
be connected to our unsub.

20:24.333 --> 20:26.202
We need to identify the remains.

20:26.203 --> 20:28.702
I'm sorry. We cannot do that.

20:28.703 --> 20:30.832
Burying the dead is a sacred act.

20:30.833 --> 20:32.122
I understand completely,

20:32.123 --> 20:33.962
but we need to process this scene,

20:33.963 --> 20:35.962
and looking in this grave is step one.

20:35.963 --> 20:39.292
I'll make a call, but this
is not going to be easy.

20:39.293 --> 20:42.893
Hey, guys, I got the source
of the blood from the shack.

20:48.003 --> 20:50.252
This looks like a religious ritual.

20:50.253 --> 20:51.622
A friend of mine is a healer

20:51.623 --> 20:53.752
who may be able to help
determine which ritual it is.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.582
Mae, send your photos to Clara.

20:55.583 --> 20:56.752
Done.

20:56.753 --> 20:58.292
And can you please have your friend

20:58.293 --> 20:59.912
meet us back at the hotel?

20:59.913 --> 21:01.082
Yes. Of course.

21:01.083 --> 21:02.252
Mae, you stay here

21:02.253 --> 21:04.202
until we can find out
who's in this grave.

21:04.203 --> 21:06.162
I'm not sure how long that's gonna take.

21:06.163 --> 21:08.542
We're nearly 12 hours
into Abby's abduction.

21:08.543 --> 21:09.933
We got to move on this.

21:12.163 --> 21:14.832
Now that we know this is
an emotionally driven unsub,

21:14.833 --> 21:16.792
chances are she feels a bond with Abby.

21:16.793 --> 21:18.702
Which means the Wagners have seen her.

21:18.703 --> 21:20.002
They just didn't know it.

21:20.003 --> 21:21.706
Our viewers would like
to know how to help,

21:21.707 --> 21:23.752
but avoiding the media has
made everyone suspicious.

21:23.753 --> 21:25.122
We're busy looking for Abby.

21:25.123 --> 21:27.082
Is it true you drugged
your daughter before bed,

21:27.083 --> 21:28.962
making her more susceptible
to the abduction?

21:28.963 --> 21:31.462
She has allergies.

21:31.463 --> 21:33.372
Wait. Who told you that?

21:33.373 --> 21:34.792
We had to do our own investigating

21:34.793 --> 21:36.332
since the authorities
locked us out of the process.

21:36.333 --> 21:38.372
We heard your wife
gave her the medicine.

21:38.373 --> 21:40.372
Do you think she gave her too much?

21:40.373 --> 21:41.622
Hey, hey. No more questions.

21:41.623 --> 21:42.962
This is Unit Chief Jack Garrett

21:42.963 --> 21:44.643
with the FBI's
international response team.

21:44.644 --> 21:45.853
Agent, do you have any leads?

21:45.854 --> 21:47.162
I said no more.

21:47.163 --> 21:48.832
Have you questioned
Owen and Emily Wagner?

21:48.833 --> 21:50.252
A-are they considered suspects?

21:50.253 --> 21:51.372
They had nothing to do

21:51.373 --> 21:52.872
with their daughter's disappearance.

21:52.873 --> 21:54.042
Some polls beg to differ.

21:54.043 --> 21:55.252
People think the
mother should be charged

21:55.253 --> 21:56.636
with negligence at the very least.

21:56.637 --> 21:57.542
That's enough.

21:57.543 --> 21:58.792
Drugging her daughter.

21:58.793 --> 22:00.542
Turn off your camera.

22:00.543 --> 22:02.433
Turn it off!

22:03.623 --> 22:05.582
Now, you listen to me.

22:05.583 --> 22:06.912
While you're out here

22:06.913 --> 22:08.202
picking apart the parents
of a missing child...

22:08.203 --> 22:09.163
It's my job.

22:09.164 --> 22:10.122
I said listen!

22:10.123 --> 22:12.372
This family is in the
middle of the worst thing

22:12.373 --> 22:13.702
that's ever happened to them.

22:13.703 --> 22:15.202
You need to seriously reconsider

22:15.203 --> 22:17.763
your reporting and find some humanity.

22:22.003 --> 22:23.872
Let's go.

22:37.793 --> 22:39.622
How's she holding up?

22:39.623 --> 22:41.412
She's still standing.

22:41.413 --> 22:43.622
You think she's up for a cognitive?

22:43.623 --> 22:45.292
I don't know.

22:46.583 --> 22:48.792
Did you get the photos from Mae?

22:48.793 --> 22:51.292
Yes, but it doesn't look like
any ritual I've ever seen.

22:51.293 --> 22:54.042
Hopefully the healer
will have some insight.

22:54.043 --> 22:56.723
His name's Jean-Paul,
and he's on his way.

23:18.043 --> 23:19.542
Jean-Paul?

23:19.543 --> 23:22.372
Not what you were expecting
for a witch doctor, eh?

23:22.373 --> 23:24.042
We're nothing to be afraid of.

23:24.043 --> 23:25.582
Oh. I appreciate you meeting me.

23:25.583 --> 23:26.752
Of course.

23:26.753 --> 23:29.162
I'm so sorry this little girl was taken.

23:29.163 --> 23:31.252
I saw the flyers all over the city.

23:33.123 --> 23:35.702
Do you know why anyone
would take her to this grave?

23:35.703 --> 23:36.912
Who is buried in here?

23:36.913 --> 23:38.962
That's what we're trying to figure out.

23:38.963 --> 23:40.542
Pauper's graves such as this

23:40.543 --> 23:42.622
is a desecration in Haitian culture.

23:42.623 --> 23:45.502
So would that be why there's
an animal sacrifice there?

23:45.503 --> 23:47.832
A living child and sacrificial animal

23:47.833 --> 23:50.002
feels like conflicting ceremonies.

23:50.003 --> 23:52.462
Whoever has taken her is confused,

23:52.463 --> 23:54.872
which makes them incredibly dangerous.

23:54.873 --> 23:58.122
However, there is an ancient ritual

23:58.123 --> 24:01.042
one year and a day after
the death of a loved one.

24:01.043 --> 24:03.752
It's to reclaim the spirit
from ancestral waters

24:03.753 --> 24:06.082
and to elevate the spirit of the dead

24:06.083 --> 24:07.872
to a new spiritual evolution.

24:07.873 --> 24:09.462
So this person thinks they can transfer

24:09.463 --> 24:11.332
a dead spirit into a new body.

24:11.333 --> 24:14.332
Yes, but the ritual itself is dangerous.

24:14.333 --> 24:17.542
It requires the host body
to be wrapped in linen

24:17.543 --> 24:19.662
before soaking them in water.

24:19.663 --> 24:22.622
Done in the wrong hands,
it's led to drowning.

24:22.623 --> 24:24.662
It sounds like waterboarding.

24:24.663 --> 24:27.042
I would never suggest practicing this

24:27.043 --> 24:28.412
with such a young person.

24:28.413 --> 24:31.002
So, um, how much time do we have

24:31.003 --> 24:33.662
before Abby's physically endangered?

24:33.663 --> 24:35.872
She was taken before sunrise,

24:35.873 --> 24:39.393
so this will be over
before the next one.

24:41.913 --> 24:45.462
It's impossible that
someone connected with Abby.

24:45.463 --> 24:46.372
I would have noticed.

24:46.373 --> 24:48.582
Not necessarily.

24:48.583 --> 24:50.162
You never knew to look for anyone.

24:50.163 --> 24:54.332
And now, during times of
stress, details often get buried.

24:54.333 --> 24:57.462
There's a way that we can dig them out.

24:57.463 --> 24:59.542
I'll do anything to help.

24:59.543 --> 25:03.292
Good.

25:03.293 --> 25:04.563
Have a seat.

25:06.793 --> 25:08.962
I'm gonna walk you
through yesterday morning,

25:08.963 --> 25:12.542
but first you need to
block out any stimuli,

25:12.543 --> 25:15.683
so... just close your eyes.

25:18.373 --> 25:20.582
Just relax.

25:20.583 --> 25:22.912
Did you wake up early?

25:22.913 --> 25:24.662
Yes.

25:24.663 --> 25:27.622
And... everyone was hungry,

25:27.623 --> 25:30.462
so we went downstairs for breakfast.

25:30.463 --> 25:31.438
Was it crowded?

25:31.439 --> 25:32.412
No.

25:32.413 --> 25:35.202
It's a simple setup. We serve ourselves.

25:35.203 --> 25:36.622
Then where did you go?

25:36.623 --> 25:38.662
We walked to the orphanage.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.502
But the girls wanted to play,

25:40.503 --> 25:43.462
so we stopped for a few
minutes, and then we kept...

25:43.463 --> 25:45.462
Okay. Hold on. Slow down.

25:45.463 --> 25:49.542
I need all the little details
so we can fill in the blanks.

25:49.543 --> 25:53.622
So, where'd the girls play?

25:53.623 --> 25:56.542
In this little park near the orphanage.

25:56.543 --> 25:58.622
Were there vendors?

25:58.623 --> 26:00.412
What did it smell like?

26:03.793 --> 26:05.912
Fried plantains.

26:05.913 --> 26:07.542
Okay.

26:07.543 --> 26:09.462
How about the sounds?

26:10.663 --> 26:12.372
Laughter.

26:12.373 --> 26:15.332
There were some other
American kids running past us.

26:15.333 --> 26:16.832
Had you seen them before?

26:16.833 --> 26:18.292
Yeah.

26:18.293 --> 26:21.502
Abby dropped her elephant,

26:21.503 --> 26:24.832
and a woman handed it to her.

26:24.833 --> 26:28.622
Was she with the other children?

26:28.623 --> 26:30.912
She was their nanny, I think.

26:30.913 --> 26:32.252
An American?

26:32.253 --> 26:34.622
No. She was Haitian.

26:34.623 --> 26:38.143
And what did Abby do when the
nanny handed her the elephant?

26:40.583 --> 26:42.662
She said, uh...

26:42.663 --> 26:43.912
Merci!

26:43.913 --> 26:46.803
And then Abby ran over to me.

26:50.623 --> 26:53.473
But the woman kept staring at us.

26:55.963 --> 26:57.582
Oh, God. Is that her?

26:57.583 --> 27:00.582
It's a small gesture, but, yes,

27:00.583 --> 27:02.582
that could have been the
connection she needed.

27:02.583 --> 27:04.412
Was that family staying at this hotel?

27:04.413 --> 27:05.662
I don't know.

27:05.663 --> 27:07.662
Can you describe what
the nanny looked like?

27:10.913 --> 27:12.832
Do you remember what she was wearing?

27:12.833 --> 27:16.622
Some kind of uniform, but
it wasn't from a hotel.

27:16.623 --> 27:17.582
It was different.

27:17.583 --> 27:19.002
She had a name tag.

27:19.003 --> 27:21.502
What did it say?

27:21.503 --> 27:22.853
Sara.

27:24.123 --> 27:27.912
Could be a local woman
from a babysitting service.

27:27.913 --> 27:29.412
Does this help?

27:29.413 --> 27:30.683
Yes.

27:33.623 --> 27:34.872
Monty?

27:34.873 --> 27:36.252
Hey, Jack.

27:36.253 --> 27:38.042
I got a weird overlap with the vendors.

27:38.043 --> 27:40.412
We think the unsub works
for a babysitting service.

27:40.413 --> 27:42.332
Funny, because that's the weirdness.

27:42.333 --> 27:44.122
Someone's cornered the market.

27:44.123 --> 27:46.582
I've got five businesses
offering babysitting services,

27:46.583 --> 27:48.622
but they all have the
same owner and address.

27:48.623 --> 27:50.372
I'm sending it to Clara now.

27:56.623 --> 27:58.853
I think it's gonna be on that corner.

28:00.833 --> 28:03.832
Monty said the owner has all of
the nanny services in the city.

28:03.833 --> 28:05.662
I'm willing to bet
he runs more than that

28:05.663 --> 28:07.252
and he's got something to hide.

28:07.253 --> 28:09.973
Now, where is this place?

28:15.663 --> 28:17.122
Hey!

28:19.333 --> 28:20.223
Hey!

28:35.623 --> 28:38.723
Come on. Get up. Get up.

28:44.043 --> 28:45.803
Merci.

28:54.963 --> 28:57.292
Call the authorities.
Let's get them out of here.

28:57.293 --> 28:59.473
There's no sign of Abby.

29:06.753 --> 29:08.752
Okay. Time to talk.

29:08.753 --> 29:11.202
Why should I help you?

29:11.203 --> 29:14.292
Well, it's men like you...
The ones who hurt children...

29:14.293 --> 29:15.622
They never survive prison.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.622
So, I'll tell you what...
You give me the names

29:17.623 --> 29:18.792
of all the people who work

29:18.793 --> 29:20.662
for your little babysitting enterprise,

29:20.663 --> 29:22.002
and I'll see to it that you go away

29:22.003 --> 29:23.462
for weapons and drug
running... How about that?...

29:23.463 --> 29:25.566
Because I'm sure you'd like
to sound like a tough guy

29:25.567 --> 29:27.792
in there as opposed to the,
uh, coward you really are.

29:27.793 --> 29:30.622
And you're the one
calling me a tough guy.

29:30.623 --> 29:32.462
Why don't we start
with anyone named Sara?

29:32.463 --> 29:33.752
I know 10 different Saras.

29:33.753 --> 29:34.872
Mm-hmm.

29:34.873 --> 29:36.662
Okay, listen... we're looking for a Sara

29:36.663 --> 29:38.292
who lost a loved one about a year ago.

29:38.293 --> 29:41.372
You think that helps you find her?

29:41.373 --> 29:42.962
Welcome to life in Haiti.

29:44.123 --> 29:45.933
Okay.

29:48.833 --> 29:49.962
Can you get a list of Saras?

29:51.203 --> 29:52.702
I'll get the list.

29:52.703 --> 29:53.853
Good.

29:55.833 --> 29:58.832
Mae, where are you
guys with the remains?

29:58.833 --> 30:01.462
Uh, haven't seen any yet, but
they're almost done digging.

30:01.463 --> 30:02.702
Okay. We got to hurry.

30:02.703 --> 30:04.662
The healer said that
Abby could be undergoing

30:04.663 --> 30:06.702
some kind of ritual that
could be fatal by sunrise.

30:06.703 --> 30:08.412
Okay, well, as soon
as I have any samples,

30:08.413 --> 30:09.542
I will rush the results,

30:09.543 --> 30:10.792
but we could still be looking at hours

30:10.793 --> 30:12.073
before I know the identity of...

30:12.074 --> 30:13.937
- Lieutenant Jarvis.
- of whoever's in here.

30:13.938 --> 30:15.177
Hang on.

30:22.833 --> 30:24.792
Yeah, we got a problem.

30:24.793 --> 30:27.292
It's a mass grave.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.233
This is gonna take a lot
longer than I thought.

30:50.363 --> 30:52.793
Elsie.

30:54.783 --> 30:57.822
Elsie.

31:00.743 --> 31:02.793
Elsie.

31:06.816 --> 31:08.895
I've got 10 bodies here.

31:08.895 --> 31:10.644
They're all male except one.

31:10.645 --> 31:12.474
Apparently that section of the slum

31:12.475 --> 31:14.524
suffered from a fatal flood a year ago.

31:14.525 --> 31:16.264
Yeah, and because of
the extreme poverty,

31:16.265 --> 31:17.928
many of them were
buried at the same time.

31:17.929 --> 31:19.934
Well, the remains are all deteriorated,

31:19.935 --> 31:21.934
so without hours to examine each one,

31:21.935 --> 31:23.854
I can't determine a cause of death,

31:23.855 --> 31:26.474
so I'll take your word
for it that they drowned.

31:26.475 --> 31:28.934
Now, the young woman is the only female,

31:28.935 --> 31:32.434
so I started with her and I
found something interesting.

31:32.435 --> 31:34.644
She has separation
of her symphysis pubis

31:34.645 --> 31:37.644
and laceration of the
ligaments on her pubic bone.

31:37.645 --> 31:41.524
So, whoever she was, she
had recently given birth.

31:41.525 --> 31:43.264
How old was she?

31:43.265 --> 31:45.604
15, 16 tops.

31:45.605 --> 31:48.524
Well, oftentimes younger
women than that are married off

31:48.525 --> 31:50.314
and pregnant earlier than that.

31:50.315 --> 31:53.724
This was almost discarded.

31:53.725 --> 31:55.785
Guys, hold on.

31:58.855 --> 32:01.024
Oh, my God.

32:01.025 --> 32:04.314
I've got the remains
of a premature infant.

32:04.315 --> 32:07.394
This may be a young woman
who didn't die in a flood.

32:07.395 --> 32:09.684
Most likely it was
childbirth that killed her.

32:09.685 --> 32:12.144
Okay, well, that's awful,

32:12.145 --> 32:14.184
but it also helps us
narrow down to who that is

32:14.185 --> 32:16.604
and how they're connected to
one of these Saras on the list.

32:16.605 --> 32:18.184
Thanks, Mae.

32:18.185 --> 32:19.684
Yeah.

32:19.685 --> 32:21.394
Monty, hey.

32:21.395 --> 32:23.699
Okay, so, I've run the list
of all babysitters named Sara,

32:23.700 --> 32:25.724
and it turns out it's not
a popular name in Haiti.

32:25.725 --> 32:27.144
However, Saraphina is.

32:27.145 --> 32:29.224
I'm thinking Osse had her shorten it

32:29.225 --> 32:30.564
to sound more American.

32:30.565 --> 32:32.314
Yeah, well, we believe

32:32.315 --> 32:33.604
the Saraphina we're looking for

32:33.605 --> 32:35.264
lost a daughter during childbirth,

32:35.265 --> 32:36.854
and if she's partaking in the ritual,

32:36.855 --> 32:38.184
she believes that Abby

32:38.185 --> 32:39.854
is gonna bring back the
spirit of her own child.

32:39.855 --> 32:41.264
And she didn't take a Haitian child

32:41.265 --> 32:42.894
who could have died from
a number of diseases.

32:42.895 --> 32:44.264
She wanted a healthy American girl

32:44.265 --> 32:45.724
who had a higher chance of survival.

32:45.725 --> 32:47.644
Right. Losing her
granddaughter and daughter

32:47.645 --> 32:49.684
could be a trigger, but we're certain

32:49.685 --> 32:51.644
that she's had a lifetime of stressors.

32:51.645 --> 32:53.724
Okay. I'm cross-referencing
all churches,

32:53.725 --> 32:55.354
prayer lists, and death records.

32:55.355 --> 32:56.644
Now, when you say "stressors,"

32:56.645 --> 32:58.684
do you think that she's lost more

32:58.685 --> 33:01.024
than just the daughter and
the infant in the grave?

33:01.025 --> 33:03.764
Yes. Look into other family losses.

33:09.605 --> 33:14.604
All right, Saraphina Labeau has
lost five loved ones since 2009.

33:14.605 --> 33:16.224
Uh, one was her husband.

33:16.225 --> 33:19.474
The other four were her children.

33:19.475 --> 33:21.434
The first death was a stillborn.

33:21.435 --> 33:23.474
Her husband died in an aftershock

33:23.475 --> 33:25.564
while scavenging for metal rubble.

33:25.565 --> 33:27.764
Then the largest outbreak of cholera

33:27.765 --> 33:29.264
killed hundreds of thousands,

33:29.265 --> 33:31.104
including all of Saraphina's children

33:31.105 --> 33:32.854
except the oldest.

33:32.855 --> 33:34.934
The only survivor was
her daughter Elsie.

33:34.935 --> 33:37.474
I mean, she's had a
lifetime of stressors,

33:37.475 --> 33:39.264
more than anyone should bear.

33:39.265 --> 33:40.764
It's been years in the making,

33:40.765 --> 33:43.028
but she's suffering from a
grief-induced psychotic break,

33:43.029 --> 33:44.724
which makes her more unpredictable.

Our presence may trigger something.

35:08.435 --> 35:10.665
We need to be prepared for anything.

35:25.797 --> 35:27.067
Merci.

36:03.297 --> 36:04.506
Saraphina?

36:04.506 --> 36:06.465
Yes?

36:06.466 --> 36:09.375
We need you to put Abby down.

36:09.376 --> 36:11.215
Who is Abby?

36:11.216 --> 36:14.125
She's the little girl in your arms.

36:14.126 --> 36:17.625
Oh, no, no, no.

36:17.626 --> 36:20.606
This is Elsie.

36:21.626 --> 36:24.255
See her beautiful soul?

36:24.256 --> 36:27.646
Oh. Let me see.

36:29.626 --> 36:30.755
Get away from her!

36:30.756 --> 36:32.965
Go away!

36:32.966 --> 36:35.316
We're not here to hurt you.

36:36.506 --> 36:39.425
No one is gonna hurt you.

36:39.426 --> 36:42.125
She is beautiful.

36:42.126 --> 36:43.125
May I see her?

36:43.126 --> 36:44.835
No!

36:44.836 --> 36:46.375
No, no, no!

36:46.376 --> 36:47.925
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

36:47.926 --> 36:49.165
It's okay.

36:49.166 --> 36:50.295
Get away from her!

36:55.216 --> 36:56.005
Aah!

36:56.006 --> 36:57.545
It's okay.

36:57.546 --> 37:00.005
No.

37:00.006 --> 37:02.066
It's too late now.

37:03.506 --> 37:06.085
They are all gone.

37:06.086 --> 37:09.856
Why don't you... why don't
you tell me about Elsie?

37:14.126 --> 37:16.755
I prayed...

37:16.756 --> 37:19.566
That she had a better life.

37:21.546 --> 37:23.816
I lived with that hope...

37:25.466 --> 37:29.726
But then she was buried
in a grave with strangers.

37:34.546 --> 37:36.896
I had to get her back.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.356
She belongs here with me.

37:43.166 --> 37:45.005
Don't you see?

37:45.006 --> 37:47.215
Listen...

37:47.216 --> 37:49.505
Your hope...

37:49.506 --> 37:52.585
Should mean something.

37:52.586 --> 37:56.005
You were being a good mother.

37:56.006 --> 37:57.585
You still can.

37:57.586 --> 38:00.526
Just let her go.

38:10.506 --> 38:12.066
It's okay.

38:25.506 --> 38:26.835
No!

38:28.796 --> 38:31.005
You did so good.

38:32.126 --> 38:33.505
It's okay.

38:33.506 --> 38:36.266
You're okay now.

38:54.716 --> 38:57.505
We're happy to report
Abby Wagner was unharmed.

38:57.506 --> 38:59.585
And luckily that allergy medicine

38:59.586 --> 39:02.465
everyone was worried about
turned into a blessing.

39:02.466 --> 39:05.505
Abby slept through everything
until she was rescued.

39:05.506 --> 39:07.875
Good job, you two.

39:09.086 --> 39:11.425

39:11.426 --> 39:12.965

39:14.666 --> 39:17.505

39:17.506 --> 39:18.925

39:18.926 --> 39:20.505
Oh, you are so welcome.

39:59.586 --> 40:01.045
What army are you feeding?

40:01.046 --> 40:03.085
My grandmother only knows
how to cook in one size.

40:03.086 --> 40:04.375
Yeah, but it is good.

40:04.376 --> 40:05.665
No doubt.

40:05.666 --> 40:07.795
Thanks for coming. It means a lot.

Aww, thank you.

40:11.376 --> 40:13.715
Hi!

40:15.837 --> 40:18.666
- Kristy, oh, my God.
- Hi!

40:18.667 --> 40:20.296
Can't believe I haven't seen you yet.

40:20.297 --> 40:22.166
Oh, well, you've been busy. My gosh.

40:22.167 --> 40:23.466
And you guys haven't stopped
since you've been back.

40:23.467 --> 40:24.376
- Mom!
- Yeah.

40:24.377 --> 40:25.546
Mom, he keeps hitting me!

40:25.547 --> 40:26.667
I'm gonna do damage control.

40:26.668 --> 40:27.891
- Stop it!
- Can you hear them?

40:27.892 --> 40:29.586
Noted. Good luck.

40:29.587 --> 40:33.046
Okay. Everyone, gather 'round.

40:33.047 --> 40:35.546
I'm, uh, usually the
one that makes the toast,

40:35.547 --> 40:38.546
and it's usually mushy,
so it's your turn.

40:38.547 --> 40:39.836
Is it?

40:39.837 --> 40:42.126
Yes, it is.

40:42.126 --> 40:44.125
Josie...

40:44.126 --> 40:46.545
The day you were born,

40:46.546 --> 40:48.925
I...

40:48.926 --> 40:52.295
I remember thinking...

40:52.296 --> 40:55.165
"This is gonna be something."

40:55.166 --> 40:57.585
And I was right.

40:57.586 --> 40:59.665
Watching you grow up

40:59.666 --> 41:05.585
has been one of the
great joys of our lives.

41:05.586 --> 41:08.045
And letting you go is...

41:08.046 --> 41:10.835
That's about the hardest thing that...

41:10.836 --> 41:13.026
That I've ever done.

41:15.426 --> 41:17.425
But that's how I know
it's the right thing to do

41:17.426 --> 41:21.795
because your mom and
I are so proud of you.

41:21.796 --> 41:24.335
No matter how far away that you go,

41:24.336 --> 41:26.856
this will always be your home.

41:31.716 --> 41:34.896
We love you more than you'll ever know.

41:35.876 --> 41:37.896
Thanks, Dad.
