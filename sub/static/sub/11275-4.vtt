00:03.600 --> 00:06.200
      <i>Last time on</i> Cheers:      

00:06.200 --> 00:08.600
     Hey, Sam, me and Eddie     
      are getting married!      

00:08.600 --> 00:10.500
 She's, uh, quite a catch, Ed.  

00:10.600 --> 00:13.100
Seems that Eddie and I picked   
the one day of the century      

00:13.100 --> 00:15.100
when all the planets            
and constellations              

00:15.100 --> 00:16.400
are in perfect alignment.       

00:16.500 --> 00:19.300
    So we either get married    
      by 4:00 p.m. today,       

00:19.400 --> 00:21.000
or we wait until the year 2042. 

00:21.100 --> 00:22.700
      This is going to be       
    an interesting wedding,     

00:22.800 --> 00:24.800
the two most superstitious      
      people in the world.      

00:24.800 --> 00:26.700
Hey, hey, don't say that.       
It's bad luck.                  

00:26.800 --> 00:29.900
            Our love can conquer
            any bad luck        
            that comes our way. 

00:30.000 --> 00:30.800
     Hey, that's my mirror.     

00:30.900 --> 00:31.700
                    ( <i>shrieks</i> ) 

00:31.700 --> 00:33.700
          I mean it, Anthony    
          and Annie moving in...

00:33.800 --> 00:35.700
                You don't want  
                to come and live

00:35.700 --> 00:38.500
    in my little, tiny          
    overcrowded house.          

00:38.600 --> 00:39.300
            Your ma hating me...

00:39.400 --> 00:41.200
I'm so happy to meet you.       

00:41.200 --> 00:42.000
            Car-la.             

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
        Anthony hating you...   

00:43.000 --> 00:44.400
You are not my father...        

00:44.400 --> 00:45.500
and you never will be.          

00:45.600 --> 00:46.100
                        Twins...

00:46.100 --> 00:47.000
I had twins once.               

00:47.000 --> 00:49.100
It was the happiest             
day of my life.                 

00:49.100 --> 00:51.800
          Every time one        
          of these little,      
          piddly things came up,

00:51.900 --> 00:54.900
  I kept thinking you were going
  to say the wedding's off.     

00:54.900 --> 00:56.300
The wedding's off.              

01:01.000 --> 01:02.100
     Afternoon, everybody.      

01:02.200 --> 01:03.900
             ALL:               
             Norm!              

01:03.900 --> 01:05.500
    Hey, Mr. Peterson,          
     would you like a beer?     

01:05.500 --> 01:06.800
          No, I'd like          
     a dead cat in a glass.     

01:10.900 --> 01:13.600
         Men, you are looking   
         at one sharp bargainer.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.600
              Not only did I get
              Carla and Eddie   

01:15.600 --> 01:18.300
        eight sterling-silver   
        place settings, but     

01:18.300 --> 01:19.800
  I also got Bruce to throw in  

01:19.900 --> 01:22.000
     matching weenie tongs      
    and lemon zester.           

01:23.800 --> 01:25.500
                  That's great, 
                  man, except...

01:25.500 --> 01:27.300
                the wedding's   
                been called off.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.500
             Ah...              

01:29.500 --> 01:30.900
    So what happened?           

01:31.000 --> 01:32.700
    Eddie freaked out           
     about being a father?      

01:32.700 --> 01:33.700
No.                             

01:33.700 --> 01:36.100
     Eddie's mom met Carla.     

01:36.100 --> 01:36.900
      Hate at first sight.      

01:36.900 --> 01:38.100
     Yeah, how'd you know?      

01:38.200 --> 01:40.900
  Well, that's the "law" part   
    of "mother-in-law," see.    

01:40.900 --> 01:42.700
So Eddie's not going            
to marry Carla                  

01:42.800 --> 01:44.800
because his mother              
doesn't approve.                

01:44.800 --> 01:46.000
I tell you,                     
it's pathetic                   

01:46.000 --> 01:50.500
to see a grown man so tied      
to his ma's apron strings.      

01:50.500 --> 01:52.800
     Well, that reminds me,     
 Mr. Clavin, you mother called  

01:52.800 --> 01:55.200
 and said she couldn't make it  
      for dinner tonight.       

01:55.300 --> 01:57.100
Oh, great. What                 
am I supposed to do             

01:57.100 --> 01:59.700
with that casserole--           
just throw it away?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.400
                Mr. Malone,     

03:22.500 --> 03:25.500
         remember that reception
         you talked me into?    

03:25.500 --> 03:27.400
 Well, it seems that the bride  
        is in my office         

03:27.500 --> 03:29.600
    and she's having a little   
    problem with the groom.     

03:29.700 --> 03:33.000
        She wants him to die    
        with festering boils.   

03:33.000 --> 03:35.400
      It's just the usual       
      prenuptial jitters.       

03:35.400 --> 03:36.700
      It'll be all right.       

03:36.800 --> 03:38.100
                It will <i>not</i>     
                <i>be all right.</i>   

03:38.100 --> 03:39.900
              I invited my boss,

03:39.900 --> 03:42.000
             and he's really    
             excited about this.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.200
            Now, if Mr. Drake   
            shows up here       

03:43.200 --> 03:45.300
    expecting a reception and   
    there isn't a reception,    

03:45.400 --> 03:46.900
              I'm gonna have egg
              all over my face. 

03:46.900 --> 03:49.000
Actually, uh, you know,         
most complexion experts         

03:49.100 --> 03:51.000
                swear by the old
                egg facial.     

03:51.000 --> 03:52.900
It tightens one's pores.        

03:54.400 --> 03:57.800
Although yours look             
pretty tight to me.             

04:00.200 --> 04:01.900
I want to talk                  
to you a minute.                

04:01.900 --> 04:05.200
Miss Howe, I think I can get    
this wedding back on track.     

04:05.300 --> 04:06.100
                      Thank God.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.200
Yeah, but I have                
one little condition.           

04:08.200 --> 04:10.500
You pull this off and you can   
have anything you want.         

04:10.600 --> 04:11.600
Really?                         

04:11.600 --> 04:13.100
                    Except that.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.900
Actually, all                   
I want to do                    

04:15.900 --> 04:18.500
is get rid of                   
these <i>stupid</i> uniforms.          

04:18.500 --> 04:20.500
          Mr. Malone, ever since
          you have worked here, 

04:20.500 --> 04:21.700
        you have done nothing   

04:21.700 --> 04:22.900
                 but whine about
                 these uniforms.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.800
         Now, I put a great deal
         of thought into them   

04:24.800 --> 04:27.100
        and I happen to think   
        they make a statement.  
Oh, yeah.                       

04:27.100 --> 04:28.800
They say I'm a lima bean.       

04:30.700 --> 04:31.600
All right. Fine, fine.          

04:31.700 --> 04:33.400
If you insist on                
keeping these uniforms,         

04:33.500 --> 04:34.700
then there'll be                
no wedding,                     

04:34.800 --> 04:35.800
no wedding reception,           

04:35.800 --> 04:38.800
and you and Mr. Drake           
can spend an intimate evening   

04:38.800 --> 04:42.100
watching 40 quarts              
of guacamole turn black.        

04:42.100 --> 04:43.800
            Fine, fine.         

04:43.800 --> 04:45.300
        Get rid of the uniforms.

04:45.300 --> 04:46.400
    Okay.                       

04:46.500 --> 04:47.500
    Woody.                      

04:47.500 --> 04:48.600
Yo.                             
    Get on the phone.           

04:48.600 --> 04:50.100
Tell the church we're running   
a little bit late.              

04:50.100 --> 04:51.700
     Cliff, see if you can      
catch up with Eddie there.      

04:51.800 --> 04:52.600
    You betcha.                 
Norm,                           

04:52.700 --> 04:54.200
      stay in the office        
      and make sure Carla       

04:54.200 --> 04:55.400
does not trash it.              
Yes, you.                       

04:55.400 --> 04:57.600
      Frasier. Go pick up       
    Carla's gown, will you?     

04:57.600 --> 04:59.400
        Right. Oh, say,         
      if anybody needs me,      

04:59.400 --> 05:01.600
         Just tell them         
  I'm at Gown-O-Rama, tra-la.   

05:05.800 --> 05:07.100
                  That was all  
                  well and good.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.400
    Thank you.                  

05:08.400 --> 05:11.000
 How do you plan on getting the 
 bride and groom back together? 

05:11.000 --> 05:12.500
 I'm going to rely on my wits.  

05:12.500 --> 05:14.600
                  Well, you're  
                  halfway there.

05:14.600 --> 05:15.800
     You better believe it.     

05:17.300 --> 05:18.200

05:19.700 --> 05:20.700
      said we gotta hurry       

05:20.700 --> 05:22.400
because he's got                
two weddings                    

05:22.400 --> 05:24.500
planned after Carla's,          
a bake sale,                    

05:24.500 --> 05:28.400
a slide show of the Knights of  
Columbus' trip to the Holy Land,

05:28.400 --> 05:30.100
and a CYO hootenanny.           

05:30.100 --> 05:31.400
            Thank you, Woody.   

05:31.400 --> 05:32.900
    Sam?                        
                Mmm?            

05:33.000 --> 05:36.900
I'm, uh... I'm thinking         
of becoming Catholic.           

05:39.500 --> 05:40.800
      We'll talk about it later.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.100
    Hey, Sammy, I got Eddie.    

05:45.100 --> 05:46.000
      Great. Where's Mama?      

05:46.000 --> 05:48.200
     I tipped the cabbie to     
     take her back to the hotel.

05:48.300 --> 05:51.200
                You already paid
                back that buck. 

05:52.400 --> 05:54.000
I'm not gonna                   
marry her, Sam.                 

05:54.000 --> 05:56.700
I mean, I can't go              
against <i>mémère's</i> wishes.        

05:56.800 --> 05:58.100
Maybe some day,                 
after Mama gets to know her     

05:58.200 --> 05:59.100
and starts to like her....      

05:59.200 --> 06:00.100
Wait, wait,                     
wait, wait, wait.               

06:00.200 --> 06:02.100
          What about the planets
          and the tea leaves?   

06:02.200 --> 06:03.600
      I mean, if you don't      
         marry her now,         

06:03.600 --> 06:05.100
      you're going to have      
    to wait till 2042.          

06:05.200 --> 06:06.300
    Sam, it's no use.           

06:06.300 --> 06:07.600
  I mean, maybe Carla's right.  

06:07.600 --> 06:09.800
      Ever since I saw her      
      on our wedding day,       

06:09.900 --> 06:11.600
we've had nothing but bad luck. 

06:11.700 --> 06:13.800
    You know, I happen          
  to think that it's bad luck   

06:13.800 --> 06:15.900
to be a jerk to the woman       
      you're in love with.      

06:16.000 --> 06:17.500
            Now, come on, Eddie.

06:17.500 --> 06:18.800
    Just talk to her.           

06:19.800 --> 06:21.600
     Okay. I guess I could      
    just talk to her.           

06:21.600 --> 06:22.700
                Great, great,   

06:22.700 --> 06:24.500
      great, great, great,      
    hold that thought.          

06:24.500 --> 06:26.100
How's it going?                 
                    Pretty good,
                    pretty good.

06:26.100 --> 06:28.300
         It better be,          
    or my butt's in a sling.    

06:28.400 --> 06:29.800
Is there room for two in there? 

06:31.700 --> 06:33.400
          Eddie's arm.          

06:33.400 --> 06:34.700
        His neck.               

06:34.800 --> 06:35.800
How's it going?                 

06:35.800 --> 06:37.000
                Oh, not too bad.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.400
         I don't think          
we've broken anything vital yet.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.400
                Eddie's foot.   

06:41.400 --> 06:42.400
    Sweetheart.                 
                Eddie's femur.  

06:42.500 --> 06:44.500
    Sit down.                   
    Hey. Stop, stop.            

06:44.600 --> 06:46.700
Would you give the guy          
a break, please?                

06:46.700 --> 06:48.000
He had to break a mirror, right?

06:48.000 --> 06:48.900
    He had to spill the salt.   

06:48.900 --> 06:51.200
             He had to thumb his
             nose to the Fates, 

06:51.300 --> 06:52.700
         and look what happened.

06:52.700 --> 06:55.000
  They turned him into a wuss.  

06:55.000 --> 06:57.600
     The important thing is     
    that the wuss came back.    

06:57.600 --> 07:00.300
      Does he have a note       
        from his mommy?         

07:00.300 --> 07:02.400
          Oh, come on,          
     just talk to the guy.      

07:02.500 --> 07:05.500
            I don't talk to     
            spineless jellyfish.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.100
All right, fine.                
I'll just, uh,                  

07:08.100 --> 07:11.300
          go out there          
     and tell him to leave.     

07:13.300 --> 07:15.500
                    Hey.        

07:16.600 --> 07:19.600
      Does he look really       
      pathetic and cute?        

07:19.600 --> 07:21.900
 Have you ever seen a puppy...  

07:21.900 --> 07:23.800
          in the rain?          

07:28.600 --> 07:30.400
            Well...             

07:30.400 --> 07:31.800
         I guess I can          

07:31.900 --> 07:33.300
     let him off the hook,      
        but first!              

07:33.300 --> 07:37.200
He has to come in here, get down
 on his knees and sweat blood.  

07:37.300 --> 07:38.700
He was hoping you'd say that.   

07:40.400 --> 07:41.300
You're smiling.                 

07:41.300 --> 07:43.000
            The wedding's on.   
Oh, yeah.                       

07:43.000 --> 07:44.500
This uniform is almost off.     

07:44.600 --> 07:47.500
Old engineer Sammy's            
got the matrimony express       

07:47.600 --> 07:49.100
right back on schedule.         

07:50.100 --> 07:51.400
      Eddie. Eddie, Eddie.      

07:51.400 --> 07:53.100
Wait a minute, man. Whoa.       

07:53.100 --> 07:54.100
                Where you going?

07:54.100 --> 07:55.500
I can't face her                
right now.                      

07:55.500 --> 07:57.400
I mean, even if I did           
change my mind                  

07:57.500 --> 07:58.900
and decide                      
to stand up to Mama,            

07:58.900 --> 08:01.300
Carla would never forgive me    
for the way I ran out.          

08:01.300 --> 08:03.000
I mean, if I went               
in there right now,             

08:03.000 --> 08:04.100
she'd tear my head off.         

08:04.200 --> 08:05.400
        Come on, Eddie.         

08:05.400 --> 08:08.600
 I think you're underestimating 
     Carla just a bit here.     

08:08.700 --> 08:10.300
What, you don't think           
she'll be mad?                  

08:10.300 --> 08:11.800
    No, I don't think           
she'll stop at your head.       

08:11.800 --> 08:12.800
SAM:                            
Norm...                         

08:12.800 --> 08:15.000
            Listen, she wants   
            to forgive you.     

08:15.100 --> 08:18.900
    All you two need is a few   
    moments together in private.

08:18.900 --> 08:20.400
Okay, but could we              
do it out here,                 

08:20.500 --> 08:22.300
where there are                 
plenty of witnesses?            

08:22.300 --> 08:23.600
                All right. Okay.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.900
Just sit down right here. Relax.

08:24.900 --> 08:27.000
If he even looks at the door,   
break his legs.                 

08:28.400 --> 08:29.700
              Sam!              

08:29.700 --> 08:31.100
The wedding frock               
you ordered.                    

08:31.100 --> 08:34.299
 I got some pretty weird looks  
  on the bus with this thing.   

08:34.299 --> 08:37.000
There was also one              
rather interesting invitation.  

08:38.600 --> 08:39.400
              Sam.              

08:39.400 --> 08:41.100
Father Berry.                   

08:41.100 --> 08:41.799
The other wedding party's       

08:41.900 --> 08:43.700
      starting to stack up      
    in the vestibule.           

08:43.700 --> 08:45.500
        Ah, I can't talk        
        to him now, man.        

08:45.600 --> 08:47.400
 I-I gotta talk to Eddie here.  

08:47.500 --> 08:48.800
    I just talked to Eddie.     

08:48.800 --> 08:50.200
     I gotta talk to Carla.     

08:50.200 --> 08:51.300
Carla?                          
                    Mm-hmm.     

08:51.300 --> 08:52.300
        Carla.                  

08:54.000 --> 08:55.800
         Father Berry?          

08:55.900 --> 08:58.400
     Listen, Sam can't talk     
     right now, but, uh...      

08:58.500 --> 09:02.700
 while I got you on the phone,  
can I ask you a question?       

09:02.700 --> 09:05.000
      Do you have to pay        
      any membership dues       

09:05.100 --> 09:07.600
    to be a Catholic?           

09:07.600 --> 09:10.400
                     I told you 
                     I wouldn't 
                     talk to him

09:10.400 --> 09:12.600
                unless he comes 
                in here begging.

09:12.600 --> 09:15.400
    Come on. Carla, we don't    
  have time for this nonsense.  

09:16.700 --> 09:17.800
Hey, I got an idea.             

09:17.800 --> 09:19.600
Get out of your clothes.        

09:19.600 --> 09:22.900
        Oh, Sammy,              
  any other time I'd love to,   

09:22.900 --> 09:24.100
         but, really...         

09:24.200 --> 09:26.200
    Well, I just think that,    
  you know, uh, you're sweaty.  

09:26.300 --> 09:27.500
You're tired,                   
Maybe you'd                     

09:27.600 --> 09:29.700
         like to change         
      into something else.      

09:29.800 --> 09:31.800
Well, hey, like this,           
for instance.                   

09:31.800 --> 09:32.900
            No way.             

09:33.000 --> 09:34.900
          Oh, come on.          
     Just, just try it on.      

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
You know, see how it fits       

09:36.000 --> 09:37.800
        in case you want        
    to get married someday.     

09:38.500 --> 09:39.600
        Years from now.         

09:39.600 --> 09:40.700
Years from now.                 
        Well, you know,         

09:40.800 --> 09:41.800
 I might not be pregnant then.  

09:41.800 --> 09:43.000
             Right.             

09:45.500 --> 09:46.200
    Come on.                    

09:46.300 --> 09:47.400
              Oh, what the heck.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.300
            This might be the   
            last chance I get   

09:49.400 --> 09:51.600
        to see what I look      
        like in one of these.   

09:51.600 --> 09:52.700
    Yeah.                       

09:52.800 --> 09:54.200
    Besides, I'm out 36 bucks.  

09:57.700 --> 09:59.400
         Eddie, Eddie.          

09:59.400 --> 10:00.500
                          Sammy.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.700
 I know what you're doing here. 

10:02.800 --> 10:05.200
        You think I'm going     
        to get all decked out   

10:05.300 --> 10:07.000
                 like Miss Bride
                 of the Year,   

10:07.000 --> 10:08.500
                take one look   
                in the mirror   

10:08.500 --> 10:10.800
            and forget all about
            being mad at Eddie. 

10:10.800 --> 10:12.300
                and I'm going   
                to go out there,

10:12.300 --> 10:14.400
            and Eddie's going to
            take one look at me 

10:14.500 --> 10:17.000
            and forget all about
            his mother. <i>Then,</i>   

10:17.100 --> 10:20.100
    we'll march down the aisle  
    and live happily ever after.

10:20.100 --> 10:23.000
                     Am I right?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.100
Yeah, that's basically it.      

10:24.200 --> 10:25.500
  You got a problem with that?  

10:27.800 --> 10:29.300
             Nah, just checking.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.100
                    Here I come.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.000
            Woo-woo.            

10:37.100 --> 10:39.500
                          Sam...

10:39.500 --> 10:40.900
 Do you really mean "woo-woo,"  

10:41.000 --> 10:42.700
        or are you              
     just saying "woo-woo"?     

10:42.700 --> 10:45.100
No, no. I don't say             
"woo-woos" lightly. Huh?        

10:45.200 --> 10:47.100
         <i>Holá.</i>                  

10:47.100 --> 10:48.000
                    Okay.       

10:48.100 --> 10:49.100
Ah, look at you.                

10:49.200 --> 10:50.100
( <i>laughing</i> )                    

10:50.200 --> 10:52.000
                 Okay. Let's    
                 give it a shot.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.500
    All right.                  

10:53.500 --> 10:55.200
    Sammy, zip me.              

10:55.200 --> 10:56.400
        Well, I'll be darned.   

10:56.500 --> 10:58.200
                 These things go
                 up, too, huh?  

11:04.800 --> 11:06.400
Oh, Carla.                      

11:06.400 --> 11:07.900
          You look...           

11:10.100 --> 11:13.600
    That's the nicest thing     
anyone's ever said to me.       

11:13.700 --> 11:15.400
    ( <i>phone ringing</i> )           

11:15.400 --> 11:16.700
            EDDIE:              
            Oh... Oh, listen.   

11:16.800 --> 11:18.200
Let's get to the church.        

11:18.200 --> 11:20.200
We have to get married          
before 4:00.                    

11:20.200 --> 11:23.900
                        Hot dog!

11:23.900 --> 11:26.100
                 Care to help me
                 with my pants? 

11:26.200 --> 11:28.300
            ( <i>happy humming</i> )   

11:34.200 --> 11:36.300
    Carla? It's your church.    

11:36.400 --> 11:38.000
             Would you tell them
             we're on our way.  

11:38.000 --> 11:39.800
     Well, that's just it.      
     They had to go ahead       

11:39.800 --> 11:41.800
     with the other wedding     
    and cancel yours.           

11:41.900 --> 11:43.500
    I knew it.                  

11:43.500 --> 11:44.700
    I <i>knew</i> it!                  

11:58.300 --> 12:01.300
     You're out of uniform.     

12:10.400 --> 12:13.000
        MONSIGNOR:              
     Dear friends, you have     
        come together...        

12:13.100 --> 12:15.000
CLIFF:                          
It sure was nice                
of the Monsignor                

12:15.100 --> 12:17.100
to let Carla and Eddie          
get married here                

12:17.200 --> 12:19.300
in the rectory chapel.          

12:19.300 --> 12:21.700
             NORM:              
Yeah, it was kind of nice       
             of us              

12:21.700 --> 12:24.700
to buy all those raffle tickets,
              too.              

12:24.700 --> 12:26.900
            FRASIER:            
        Good Lord,              
     it's crowded in here.      

12:27.000 --> 12:28.300
    But on the upside,          

12:28.300 --> 12:32.000
it does satiate any desire      
I might have had to visit Tokyo.

12:33.400 --> 12:37.100
Edward, have you come here      
freely without reservation      

12:37.100 --> 12:40.200
        to give yourself        
     to Carla in marriage?      

12:40.200 --> 12:41.800
            Edward?             

12:41.900 --> 12:45.500
     Carla, where's Edward?     

12:45.500 --> 12:49.700
     Carla? Where's Carla?      

12:49.800 --> 12:52.200
Excuse me.                      
Excuse me!                      

12:52.300 --> 12:54.100
    Lady with a baby.           

12:54.100 --> 12:58.200
        Excuse...               
  Would you get off the dress!  

12:58.200 --> 12:59.700
     All right, all right,      
        all right.              

12:59.700 --> 13:01.200
      Crank it up, Father.      

13:01.300 --> 13:04.700
All the forces in the universe  
say we have to be done by 4:00. 

13:04.800 --> 13:06.100
         ( <i>bell tolls</i> )         
            Oh, no!             

13:06.200 --> 13:08.200
    Do you, Edward Raymond,     
  take Carla Maria Victoria...  

13:08.200 --> 13:09.200
  Hurry! Hurry! Please, hurry!  

13:09.200 --> 13:12.400
 Angelina Theresa Apollonia...  

13:12.400 --> 13:14.100
             CARLA:             
            Oh, rat!            

13:14.100 --> 13:17.500
    Why couldn't my parents     
      have named me Judy?       

13:21.900 --> 13:24.100
            Go on, go on, go on.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.300
Hey, here they come!            

13:32.300 --> 13:33.400
     Ladies and gentlemen,      

13:33.400 --> 13:35.700
    this is the moment          
  we've all been waiting for.   

13:35.800 --> 13:39.300
  Appearing for the first time  
  anywhere, the happy couple,   

13:39.400 --> 13:41.300
Mr. and Mrs. Eddie LeBec.       

13:41.400 --> 13:43.200
         ( <i>drum roll</i> )          

13:43.200 --> 13:44.900
( <i>cheering and applause</i> )       

13:47.100 --> 13:49.900
        That's a keeper.        

13:50.000 --> 13:51.700
            Hey, guys, it's     
            your wedding day.   

13:51.700 --> 13:53.400
            Show a little teeth 
            here, all right?    

13:53.500 --> 13:54.900
        I can't, Sammy.         

13:55.000 --> 13:57.800
    We were pronounced          
     man and wife at 4:01.      

13:57.900 --> 14:00.200
        We might as well have   
        been pronounced dead.   

14:00.300 --> 14:01.200
                We're doomed.   

14:01.300 --> 14:03.400
                Music, music!   

14:03.400 --> 14:04.600
     Aw, come on, you guys.     

14:04.600 --> 14:05.600
        Think about all         
    the wedding gifts           

14:05.600 --> 14:06.800
        you got to open         
          over there.           

14:06.800 --> 14:07.800
                Yeah.           

14:07.900 --> 14:08.800
                I guess I should
                be grateful     

14:08.900 --> 14:10.000
        Eddy didn't fall down   
        the church steps        

14:10.100 --> 14:11.200
            and break his leg.  

14:11.200 --> 14:12.900
            How is it, anyway?  

14:12.900 --> 14:16.500
I think I just                  
wrenched it a little.           

14:16.500 --> 14:19.500
                They don't look 
                too happy to me.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.900
No. They do look married,       
though.                         

14:26.300 --> 14:29.200
What's that                     
ugly-looking thing?             

14:29.200 --> 14:31.600
        It's not an ugly thing. 

14:31.600 --> 14:34.000
                It's a Wabby.   

14:34.000 --> 14:38.600
What's a Wabby, Webecca?        

14:38.700 --> 14:41.700
        It's a "Women of Boston 
        Business" award.        

14:41.700 --> 14:43.300
        I'm very proud of it.   

14:43.400 --> 14:46.000
            It happens to be    
            very prestigious.   

14:46.000 --> 14:48.700
            Thousands of women  
            have won it.        

14:48.700 --> 14:51.400
What's it doing                 
out here?                       

14:51.400 --> 14:53.600
You trying                      
to impress your boss?           

14:53.600 --> 14:54.700
                I'm glad        
                you reminded me.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.500
        I'm completely          
        forgot he was coming.   

14:56.500 --> 14:57.500
Yeah, sure you did.             

14:57.500 --> 14:58.500
Hey, you know,                  

14:58.600 --> 15:01.200
every time Evan Drake's name    
gets mentioned                  

15:01.300 --> 15:03.100
you get a little red            
around the gills.               

15:03.100 --> 15:05.000
Do you have                     
a crush on him                  
or something?                   

15:05.000 --> 15:06.600
            I beg your pardon.  

15:06.700 --> 15:09.400
                He happens to be
                a married man.  

15:09.400 --> 15:11.800
        Although not happily.   

15:13.500 --> 15:16.000
Oh, you <i>do</i> have a crush on him. 

15:16.000 --> 15:17.600
        How cute!               

15:17.600 --> 15:19.600
"Oh, Evan, Evan."               

15:23.200 --> 15:25.000
Great stuffed mushrooms,        
Cliffie.                        

15:25.000 --> 15:26.100
                Try the Swedish 
                meatballs.      

15:26.100 --> 15:27.800
                They're out     
                of this world.  

15:27.800 --> 15:28.900
        Yeah.                   

15:28.900 --> 15:32.300
Ooh, try 'em together!          
Together!                       

15:32.300 --> 15:34.000
     Excuse me, gentlemen.      

15:34.000 --> 15:35.200
     Do you plan on leaving     

15:35.200 --> 15:37.100
    any hors d'oeuvres          
        for latecomers?         

15:37.100 --> 15:39.100
        Hey, you snooze,        
        you lose.               

15:40.700 --> 15:42.000
Ooh-ooh! Rumaki!                

15:42.100 --> 15:43.500
Come on.                        

15:47.500 --> 15:49.400
    And now it's time           
for the traditional first dance,

15:49.400 --> 15:51.200
  and we all know who's going   
          to start it.          

15:53.300 --> 15:56.600
 Holy cow, it isn't me, is it?  

15:57.900 --> 15:59.100
Let's welcome                   

15:59.200 --> 16:02.800
the happy couple Carla and Eddie
to the dance floor.             

16:05.300 --> 16:10.300
      ¶ The greatest love       
    the world has known... ¶    

16:15.800 --> 16:18.100
Hit me again, Harley.           

16:18.100 --> 16:20.900
    Third time's the charm.     

16:25.100 --> 16:29.300
            So, uh, where's your
            big-shot lover boy? 

16:29.400 --> 16:32.900
A: I told you                   
he is not my lover boy.         

16:33.000 --> 16:38.400
B: The big shot SOB             
is in a meeting.                

16:38.500 --> 16:41.100
C: Choke on it.                 

16:41.200 --> 16:42.300
     There's a happy pair.      

16:42.300 --> 16:43.500
    Say cheeseburger.           

16:43.500 --> 16:45.400
                    Uh, no, no. 

16:45.400 --> 16:47.600
        All right,              
      that was a good one,      

16:47.600 --> 16:50.700
even with Miss Howe's eyes      
     kinda gimpy like that.     

16:51.900 --> 16:52.800
                Oh, Norm, look. 

16:52.800 --> 16:54.700
            We forgot about     
            the dessert table.  

16:54.800 --> 16:56.300
        And we call ourselves   
        guests.                 

16:58.300 --> 17:01.300
            Ma, you want        
            to trade partners?  

17:01.300 --> 17:03.900
            Why not?            
            I'm going to die.   

17:03.900 --> 17:08.200
            I'm going to dance  
            with my mother,     
            all right?          

17:10.200 --> 17:12.500
                How about a cup 
                of coffee, huh? 

17:12.500 --> 17:14.300
      Why would I do that?      

17:14.300 --> 17:15.599
    Well, because I've seen     

17:15.700 --> 17:18.500
      a lot of ladies hit       
the champagne in my time.       

17:18.599 --> 17:20.500
                One minute      
                they're doing   
                just fine.      

17:20.500 --> 17:22.900
            The next minute     
            it kind of sneaks   
            up on them          

17:22.900 --> 17:24.800
            and they're doing   
            all sorts           

17:24.800 --> 17:26.500
      of wild and crazy...      

17:26.500 --> 17:30.100
  Why <i>am</i> I giving you coffee?   

17:31.200 --> 17:33.400
                    So, Eddie,  

17:33.500 --> 17:36.800
        what's Mother Tortelli  
        like in bed?            

17:47.300 --> 17:50.100
                    What are you
                    looking at, 
                    pretty lady?

17:50.100 --> 17:52.600
I'm looking at you.             

17:52.600 --> 17:55.100
            Well, I'm looking   
            back at you.        

17:55.100 --> 17:57.600
I think I'm beginning           
to see you                      

17:57.700 --> 17:59.500
in a whole new light.           

17:59.600 --> 18:02.800
        Why don't you tell me   
        what you see?           

18:04.200 --> 18:07.200
You have a really weird face.   

18:10.200 --> 18:12.700
Your eyebrows                   
are growing together            

18:12.800 --> 18:15.500
like a big old                  
ugly caterpillar.               

18:17.000 --> 18:20.700
Oh, look,                       
they're cutting the cake.       

18:45.100 --> 18:47.400
And now as the hour draws late, 

18:47.500 --> 18:49.900
    it's time for the bride     
     to throw the bouquet.      

18:49.900 --> 18:51.800
    Okay, come on, come on,     
        everybody.              

18:53.700 --> 18:55.300
                You all ready?  

18:55.400 --> 18:59.000
                Okay, heads up, 
                you old maids.  

18:59.000 --> 19:02.300
        Dr. Crane,              
        a girl's supposed       
        to catch the bouquet.   

19:02.400 --> 19:03.900
Well, then the girls            
should have been                

19:03.900 --> 19:05.100
a little bit quicker.           

19:05.100 --> 19:07.000
                Here, knock     
                yourself out.   

19:14.300 --> 19:17.400
    I think it's time           
     for me to pack it in.      

19:17.400 --> 19:18.200
Uh, you know,                   
I don't think                   

19:18.200 --> 19:19.600
you're in any condition         
to drive, Miss Howe.            

19:19.600 --> 19:20.800
Let me give you                 
a lift home, all right?         

19:20.900 --> 19:22.000
         I don't know.          

19:22.000 --> 19:26.100
 I've never been alone in a car 
     with such a hairy guy.     

19:27.400 --> 19:30.600
    Are you sure you weren't    
    in <i>The Planet of The Apes?</i>  

19:31.500 --> 19:34.900
            Can anybody else    
            please take me home?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.100
There's room in our car.        

19:37.100 --> 19:38.600
You can sit on my lap.          

19:38.600 --> 19:41.100
                Darling, you're 
                married now.    

19:41.100 --> 19:43.700
                You don't have  
                a lap.          

19:43.800 --> 19:46.900
Come on.                        
You think I'm so ugly?          

19:46.900 --> 19:48.300
I'll let you get a bag          

19:48.300 --> 19:50.400
and put it over my head,        
all right?                      

19:50.400 --> 19:53.400
         Just a minute.         
    Let me get my bag.          

19:53.500 --> 19:55.700
        And yours.              

19:55.700 --> 19:59.400
         I'm not crazy          
about the way that girl flirts. 

19:59.400 --> 20:00.700
And now, folks,                 

20:00.700 --> 20:02.000
 as the lucky couple gets ready 

20:02.000 --> 20:03.500
        to embark               
  on their new life together,   

20:03.500 --> 20:07.000
let's all throw some rice,      
    the symbol of fertility.    

20:08.800 --> 20:10.300
                    Ow!         

20:10.400 --> 20:12.400
                        Oh, ow! 

20:12.500 --> 20:13.600
                    Ah!         

20:13.600 --> 20:14.900
I can't go                      
out here, Eddie.                

20:14.900 --> 20:15.900
                            Why?

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
No, it's too dangerous.         

20:17.100 --> 20:18.100
                    I'm okay.   

20:18.100 --> 20:19.700
Who are we trying               
to kid here?                    

20:19.700 --> 20:22.600
We're living                    
in the shadow                   
of the curse                    

20:22.600 --> 20:24.200
we brought                      
on ourselves.                   

20:24.300 --> 20:26.000
I can't go on                   
with this.                      

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
                Come on, Carla. 

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
          No, no, no.           

20:28.000 --> 20:30.800
                I think maybe   
                we should get   
                an annulment.   

20:30.900 --> 20:33.200
            Oh, would you two   
            stop it?!           

20:33.200 --> 20:34.200
    I can't believe...          

20:34.200 --> 20:36.300
  This should be the happiest   
    day of your lives,          

20:36.400 --> 20:38.500
      and all you've done       
    is moan and groan           

20:38.600 --> 20:40.400
                all day long.   
                I mean, come on.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.600
  It's one thing to play along  

20:41.600 --> 20:44.200
  with this superstition stuff  
  for, you know, for some fun,  

20:44.300 --> 20:45.700
     but you're letting it      
        interfere               

20:45.800 --> 20:47.300
with your happiness here.       

20:47.300 --> 20:48.200
                You two         
                are wonderful.  

20:48.300 --> 20:49.600
            You got everything  
            in your life        

20:49.600 --> 20:51.000
            to look forward to. 

20:51.000 --> 20:53.200
    Please, please, come on.    
        Trust me.               

20:53.200 --> 20:55.700
Nothing bad is going to happen. 

20:55.700 --> 20:58.200
        ( <i>phone rings</i> )         

20:58.200 --> 21:00.500
    You got my personal word    
            on that.            

21:00.500 --> 21:02.500
I mean, superstition,           
it's for the birds.             

21:02.600 --> 21:04.300
Just go on                      
with your normal life.          

21:04.300 --> 21:06.000
Woody, do you mind?             

21:06.000 --> 21:07.100
All right, fine.                
Go ahead. Answer it.            

21:07.100 --> 21:08.300
It's probably                   
just somebody who wants         

21:08.300 --> 21:10.700
to, uh, know what time          
the bar closes.                 

21:10.700 --> 21:12.900
            We close at 2:00.   

21:14.300 --> 21:15.700
            Eddie, it's for you.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.500
                Some guy        
                from the Bruins.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.600
Maybe, maybe you oughta...      

21:18.700 --> 21:21.800
Probably just want              
to congratulate me              
on my wedding.                  

21:21.900 --> 21:23.700
Yeah, right.                    
That's it. That's it.           

21:23.700 --> 21:25.900
        Hello.                  

21:25.900 --> 21:27.100
        Oh, hiya, Frank         

21:27.200 --> 21:28.600
     Yeah, how's it going?      

21:28.600 --> 21:29.500
It's Frank.                     

21:29.500 --> 21:30.800
Yeah,                           

21:30.800 --> 21:33.000
            uh-huh.             

21:33.100 --> 21:34.200
            Uh-huh.             

21:35.500 --> 21:38.000
            Uh-huh.             

21:38.000 --> 21:39.900
Okay, yeah.                     

21:39.900 --> 21:43.400
Yeah, thanks a lot.             

21:43.400 --> 21:45.200
Good-bye, Frank.                

21:47.200 --> 21:49.400
Do I smell a bonus?             

21:49.500 --> 21:51.800
They cut me from the team.      

21:51.800 --> 21:53.700
They're going                   
with the youth movement.        

21:53.700 --> 21:57.500
They tried to trade me,         
but nobody wanted me.           

21:57.500 --> 21:58.600
    I'm sorry, Carla.           

21:58.600 --> 22:00.400
            I guess             
     all the superstitions      

22:00.500 --> 22:02.200
    finally caught up           
            with us.            

22:03.200 --> 22:05.100
Wait a minute.                  
Wait a minute.                  

22:05.100 --> 22:09.300
I can blame a lot               
of things on superstition,      

22:09.400 --> 22:11.800
but you aren't                  
the greatest goalie             
in the world, honey.            

22:11.800 --> 22:14.100
            What are you saying 
            to me, Carla?       

22:14.200 --> 22:17.100
Well, you know,                 
the end of last year            
you were losing it,             

22:17.100 --> 22:19.900
and now you're older,           
and your reflexes are shot.     

22:19.900 --> 22:21.700
            Oh, thanks a lot.   

22:21.700 --> 22:25.500
            I'm feeling a lot   
            better already.     

22:25.600 --> 22:29.900
And if that wasn't              
because of superstition,        

22:29.900 --> 22:34.000
then maybe the twins            
aren't bad luck either.         

22:34.100 --> 22:36.100
Could it be possible            

22:36.200 --> 22:39.500
that I'm just having twins      
    because the eggs split?     

22:42.500 --> 22:43.600
          Whoa, whoa!           

22:43.600 --> 22:48.700
 And maybe your mother hates me 
     because she's stupid.      

22:50.400 --> 22:51.800
     And Anthony hates you      

22:51.900 --> 22:55.500
     because he takes after     
 his no-good rat-faced father.  

22:57.000 --> 23:00.100
      And all those things      
 that we thought were bad luck  

23:00.200 --> 23:03.200
    had nothing to do           
    with superstition.          

23:03.200 --> 23:05.000
         It was just...         

23:05.100 --> 23:07.100
             life.              

23:08.500 --> 23:11.700
         Unfortunately,         
it happens to be my life.       

23:12.900 --> 23:16.300
         What the heck?         

23:16.300 --> 23:20.200
    I'm married and in love     
    with a great guy.           

23:23.800 --> 23:27.200
So, I guess                     
that evens things up.           

23:27.200 --> 23:28.800
No, it doesn't.                 

23:30.100 --> 23:33.400
But it makes life worth living. 

23:33.400 --> 23:34.600
        No, it doesn't.         

23:36.600 --> 23:39.400
But it's something.             

23:39.400 --> 23:42.800
    So let's get on with it.    

23:42.800 --> 23:44.500
What do you say,                
hubby?                          

23:46.900 --> 23:50.200
        I say let's get on      
        with the honeymoon, eh? 

23:50.300 --> 23:51.400
See you at 2:00 A.M.            

23:51.500 --> 23:54.700
Somebody's got to work          
in this family.                 

23:54.700 --> 23:57.700
Hi. I'm Mrs. Eddie LeBec.       

23:57.800 --> 23:59.500
What'll you have?
