WEBVTT

01:19.037 --> 01:20.455
HOUSEMATES IN BELLE EPOQUE

01:20.538 --> 01:22.832
-Hooray! Jin-myung is coming!
-That's right.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.375
All right, Jin-myung.

01:24.459 --> 01:27.420
After my 23 years on Earth, I got to know
what missing someone feels like.

01:27.504 --> 01:28.963
Do you come bearing gifts?

01:29.047 --> 01:30.673
Bad girl. Slap!

01:30.757 --> 01:32.300
She's right. Slap!

01:32.383 --> 01:35.428
I'm just happy that Jin-myung is coming.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.347
Jin-myung is the gift.

01:37.430 --> 01:40.183
Eun-jae has changed.
The youngest became crafty.

01:40.266 --> 01:41.643
I was always like this.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.394
Do you think Jin-myung changed?

01:43.478 --> 01:46.022
-Lazy bum.
-What? Lazy bum?

01:46.105 --> 01:49.234
Jin-myung and laziness?
That's a combo I would like to see.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.693
Then, fatso...

01:50.777 --> 01:52.612
Chinese food is greasy, so perhaps.

01:52.695 --> 01:54.572
No, she may have gotten thinner,

01:54.656 --> 01:56.825
because she didn't have money for food.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.577
If she lands at 2:30 p.m.,
what time will she be home?

01:59.661 --> 02:01.996
After getting her bags and stuff,
like around 6:00 p.m.?

02:02.122 --> 02:03.623
-Should we pick her up?
-What?

02:03.706 --> 02:04.791
-What?
-What?

02:04.874 --> 02:07.085
Let's go. Let's surprise her.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.712
You wrote it here,
so it is not a surprise anymore.

02:11.005 --> 02:12.715
Should we really go?

02:12.799 --> 02:13.842
-I'm in.
-Me too.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.009
I have class.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.094
-Cut.
-Cut.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.637
I'll cut.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.973
We'll pick you up, Jin-myung!

02:20.056 --> 02:21.975
Wait for us.

02:22.183 --> 02:24.310
Jin-myung, we'll pick you up.

02:42.036 --> 02:43.288
Jin-myung.

03:06.603 --> 03:07.854
Hi.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.148
You're back.

03:10.481 --> 03:12.442
Let's go before it gets dark.

04:15.797 --> 04:19.717
EPISODE 1
ANGRY OVER SMALL THINGS #TheWorldofUs

04:20.301 --> 04:26.766
FIVE HOURS BEFORE JIN-MYUNG'S ARRIVAL

04:39.821 --> 04:41.447
JIN-MYUNG ARRIVING!

04:45.201 --> 04:46.744
Hooray!

04:51.082 --> 04:52.750
Hooray! Jin-myung is coming!

04:52.834 --> 04:57.297
That's right. I miss you, Jin-myung.
Hurry back.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.757
All right, Jin-myung.

04:59.841 --> 05:03.136
After my 23 years on Earth, I got to know
what missing someone feels like.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.179
Morning. Are you up?

05:06.180 --> 05:07.890
Do you come bearing gifts?

05:08.224 --> 05:09.809
Bad girl. Slap!

05:09.892 --> 05:11.602
She's right. Slap!

05:12.186 --> 05:14.897
I'm just happy that Jin-myung is coming.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.858
Jin-myung is the gift.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.027
Half awake.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.821
Eun-jae has changed.
The youngest became crafty.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.490
I was always like this.

05:24.574 --> 05:27.744
The prince wakes up
with the princess' kiss.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.287
Lazy bum.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.956
What? Lazy bum?

05:32.373 --> 05:36.377
Jin-myung and laziness?
That's a combo I would like to see.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.963
Then, fatso...

05:39.213 --> 05:41.299
Chinese food is greasy, so perhaps.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.510
No, she may have gotten thinner,

05:44.594 --> 05:46.637
because she didn't have money for food.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.933
May I use the bathroom now?

05:58.357 --> 06:00.943
UNREAD FROM HERE

06:01.027 --> 06:03.946
If she lands at 2:30 p.m.,
what time will she be home?

06:04.030 --> 06:06.532
After getting her bags and stuff,
like around 6:00 p.m.?

06:07.867 --> 06:09.243
Should we pick her up?

06:10.078 --> 06:12.497
Let's go. Let's surprise her.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.385
You wrote it here...

06:26.469 --> 06:27.512
Should we really go?

06:27.595 --> 06:28.679
I have class.

06:28.763 --> 06:29.847
-Cut.
-I'll cut.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.682
-We'll come get you!
-Wait for us.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.686
I was just kidding,
but they took me seriously.

06:36.270 --> 06:37.730
Dang it.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.692
I'm not really ready to go outside yet,

06:42.527 --> 06:44.946
but what can I do?
Everyone else wants to go.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.199
I can't be the only one not going.

06:51.202 --> 06:54.539
I was going to hang out
with Jong-yeoul after class.

06:55.164 --> 06:59.168
But if I say that, they may complain
that I'm bragging I have a boyfriend.

07:01.337 --> 07:04.507
I'm the only one of us with a boyfriend.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.217
I meant

07:06.425 --> 07:10.054
I'm fine going or not going. Whatever.

07:12.807 --> 07:13.975
I'm so excited.

07:17.311 --> 07:18.813
Let's hurry.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.501
Why are we going so early?
It'll only take an hour.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.337
We'll probably see a cafe that we like
on our way there.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.507
Then we must drink some coffee there.

07:46.591 --> 07:47.800
-Yes, we must!
-Yes, we must!

07:47.884 --> 07:50.178
It's so nice out.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.180
Let's go!

08:13.826 --> 08:17.121
Spinning today is your cutie-pie DJ Song.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.539
Hello everyone.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.208
The first song of the day...

08:20.291 --> 08:22.251
-Turn right.
-Yes, sir.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.182
Why are they honking?

08:38.643 --> 08:40.436
I think they're honking at us.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.854
No. Why would they?

08:42.021 --> 08:45.358
In 100m, turn right. Turn right.

08:56.994 --> 09:00.122
What the heck? What are you doing?

09:00.206 --> 09:03.709
-What?
-You should stop before making a turn.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.337
-Why?
-Why? Cars going straight get priority.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.964
Then left turns, then right!

09:08.548 --> 09:09.882
Really?

09:11.634 --> 09:13.344
Did you say, "Really?"

09:15.555 --> 09:18.724
You weren't boldly cutting people off?

09:20.476 --> 09:23.396
We almost died just now
without us even realizing it?

09:32.780 --> 09:34.448
What's wrong? What?

09:34.991 --> 09:36.951
Look straight!

09:43.374 --> 09:44.792
What?

09:45.334 --> 09:47.670
The side mirrors!

09:47.753 --> 09:49.505
What? This?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.674
Hey. How do you pop these out?

09:54.969 --> 09:56.137
This is it.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.934
Don't tell me you've never
had it out this entire time.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.020
No, I did a few times.

10:04.103 --> 10:07.064
-I'm getting out.
-You can't get out. Sit still!

10:16.198 --> 10:18.159
How did she get her license?

10:18.743 --> 10:20.369
She doesn't even know about road courtesy.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.204
I knew she was a novice driver, but...

10:22.288 --> 10:24.624
She should drive carefully
like other novice drivers.

10:24.707 --> 10:25.916
She's...

10:27.627 --> 10:29.211
Then why did she want to go?

10:29.795 --> 10:32.381
My mom said this year's going to be
a bad year for me.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.342
I should've gotten a lucky charm.

10:34.425 --> 10:37.345
I did well in the past.

10:38.346 --> 10:42.683
It's because they were screaming,
that I started getting nervous.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.185
Dang it.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.444
In 100m, turn left.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.404
Get in the left lane.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.868
Look at the side mirrors. The side mirror.

11:02.995 --> 11:06.082
Straight! Look straight!

11:16.008 --> 11:18.719
You've exited the route. Recalculating.

11:19.303 --> 11:21.055
-In 100m...
-Make a right.

11:21.138 --> 11:22.348
Go right.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.147
You've exited the route.

11:30.231 --> 11:33.275
You've exited the route. Recalculating.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.194
-In 150m...
-U-turn.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.071
Left. Go left again.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.032
Look straight!

11:50.793 --> 11:52.545
We may end up in North Korea.

11:52.628 --> 11:55.423
It's all your fault!
You criticized me for no reason.

11:55.506 --> 11:59.552
We didn't criticize you for no reason!
How have you been driving all this time?

11:59.635 --> 12:02.513
I haven't had a single accident
in a month.

12:02.596 --> 12:05.433
Maybe there were
a bunch of accidents near her car.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.268
You've exited the route.

12:07.351 --> 12:09.061
I know that already!

12:14.733 --> 12:16.527
I'm sorry. Please...

12:20.948 --> 12:21.824
Cut in.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.784
You can do it.

12:24.368 --> 12:26.203
Eun-jae, get in! I can't see!

12:26.287 --> 12:28.080
Just cut in!

12:37.590 --> 12:39.842
Just a minute, sir!

12:42.011 --> 12:44.180
Sir! Please let us in!

12:44.763 --> 12:47.725
Please! We want to turn right!

12:48.309 --> 12:49.560
Cut in.

12:50.853 --> 12:51.896
Go.

12:51.979 --> 12:54.690
Go in. This is it. You have to cut in now.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.067
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

12:57.151 --> 12:58.486
Go.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.914
Take the ramp to the expressway
on the right.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.752
Please make sure
your seat belts are secured.

13:19.048 --> 13:22.593
INCHEON AIRPORT EXPRESSWAY

13:28.140 --> 13:31.268
It's okay. Just follow the car in front.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.020
You can do it.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.200
Where are you going?

13:52.790 --> 13:54.041
I'm sorry.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.127
You should've stopped your car.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.049
-What?
-Your car! It's moving!

14:02.132 --> 14:04.677
Look! It'll hit someone!

14:10.140 --> 14:13.018
-Hurry!
-Get in!

14:13.102 --> 14:15.104
-Hurry!
-Get in!

14:21.026 --> 14:22.862
Sorry.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.074
It's okay. We can go now.

14:27.157 --> 14:28.951
I'm so scared.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.378
What is that sound?

14:39.461 --> 14:42.089
Seat belt. Someone buckle me in.

14:42.172 --> 14:43.883
My seat belt.

14:46.927 --> 14:47.887
I can't see!

14:47.970 --> 14:49.680
Stop it! Just go!

14:49.763 --> 14:51.515
Dang it.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.273
Jin-myung.

15:23.297 --> 15:24.506
Is something wrong?

15:27.718 --> 15:28.928
What is it?

15:31.096 --> 15:33.724
Jin-myung. Why did you come?

15:34.016 --> 15:36.435
-What?
-Let's call a designated driver.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.438
Yes, let's chip in and call a driver.

15:39.521 --> 15:40.856
I have 20,000 won.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.068
-I have...
-We can't fit then!

15:49.448 --> 15:50.908
What is it?

15:51.575 --> 15:54.161
-She's a novice driver.
-It's serious.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.122
That's all?

15:57.206 --> 15:58.791
Everyone's a beginner at first.

15:58.874 --> 16:01.460
And beginners never get into
big accidents anyway.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.889
Why did you all get in?

16:15.265 --> 16:16.976
You need to help me back up.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.897
Dang it. Seriously.

16:28.696 --> 16:29.947
Okay.

16:30.489 --> 16:31.699
Back.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.621
You forgot the emergency brake.

16:39.873 --> 16:41.083
Okay.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.377
-Slowly!
-Okay!

17:02.980 --> 17:04.398
Go back in there!

18:02.790 --> 18:05.417
It's a long ride.
The middle seat is a bit...

18:06.251 --> 18:07.920
The seat belt isn't good either.

18:12.424 --> 18:13.258
What?

18:13.842 --> 18:16.386
The youngest is supposed to sit
in the middle seat.

18:17.596 --> 18:20.140
You look like a stranger.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.060
It's in your head.

18:25.229 --> 18:28.107
Jin-myung, how was China? Was it fun?

18:28.857 --> 18:31.068
It was fun and tiring.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.696
Where did you go?

18:34.780 --> 18:37.157
-The Great Wall...
-Was the food okay?

18:37.908 --> 18:39.743
I wasn't a fan of the food.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.245
You didn't eat the good stuff.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.497
Good Chinese food is so delicious.

18:44.164 --> 18:46.583
That place you sent a picture of
was really nice.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.252
Did you have Dongpo pork?

18:48.335 --> 18:49.711
No.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.047
She kept cutting me off.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.007
She doesn't do it to others.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.342
Just to me.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.053
She has no respect for me.

18:58.929 --> 18:59.972
I'll cut her off too.

19:00.055 --> 19:02.599
What did you eat then?
Did you have dim sum?

19:02.683 --> 19:03.851
Yes, that I had.

19:03.934 --> 19:07.062
-Isn't that...
-Jin-myung, give me your trash.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.277
This is yummy. Where did you get it?

19:27.624 --> 19:29.501
I was thirsty because I was so nervous.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.086
But she only fed herself.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.672
Sitting shotgun means
you should take care of the driver.

19:34.756 --> 19:37.301
-Jin-myung, did you bring us gifts?
-What?

19:37.384 --> 19:38.427
Come on.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.597
She couldn't even eat
Dongpo pork in China.

19:42.222 --> 19:44.391
You don't need to spend money for gifts.

19:44.474 --> 19:46.310
It comes from the heart.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.228
Like a rock from the Great Wall,

19:48.312 --> 19:50.981
or a piece of glass
from the Forbidden City.

19:52.774 --> 19:55.444
She ate one, so I thought
the next one would be for me.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.446
I did buy something, but...

19:58.363 --> 20:00.365
You did? Awesome!

20:00.449 --> 20:03.452
Why did you do that? You had no money.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.079
It's nothing much.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.498
Why isn't it much? It totally is.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.626
You bought it for me.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.503
It isn't a keychain, is it?

20:14.463 --> 20:15.756
No way.

20:22.262 --> 20:24.473
What could it be?

20:24.556 --> 20:25.849
What could it be?

20:25.933 --> 20:28.185
No. It's best not to be curious.

20:30.604 --> 20:34.149
What could it be? I'm so curious.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.445
-Let's go to the rest stop.
-Why? Just go!

20:38.528 --> 20:40.155
I need the bathroom.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.949
-Hold it in!
-I can't, that's why!

20:42.532 --> 20:44.660
That's because you ate
so many dang clementines!

20:46.328 --> 20:48.497
Why is she pissed at me?
I didn't eat alone.

20:48.580 --> 20:52.417
It's not pee. I got my period!

20:53.418 --> 20:54.294
Seriously.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.725
I don't care if the car seat gets bloody.

21:09.017 --> 21:10.394
It isn't my car.

21:11.019 --> 21:13.230
It's okay. We can take the next exit.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.815
We can go back in.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.526
Like it's that easy.

21:20.195 --> 21:23.073
One, two,

21:24.574 --> 21:25.701
three.

21:36.336 --> 21:37.629
Which way?

21:38.922 --> 21:40.632
I need to go to the bathroom.

21:41.049 --> 21:42.301
Do you see anything?

21:42.426 --> 21:44.261
Let's ask that car.

21:52.644 --> 21:55.647
Sir, is there a gas station nearby?

21:57.190 --> 21:58.650
Make a left.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.319
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

22:00.402 --> 22:02.446
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

22:07.075 --> 22:08.076
Go ahead.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.078
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.331
-Bless you.
-Thank you.

22:12.414 --> 22:13.498
Thank you.

22:15.208 --> 22:17.294
There are still good people out there.

22:28.388 --> 22:29.931
Hello.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.148
-How much?
-Just 30,000 won.

22:38.231 --> 22:40.734
Okay, three million won.
Open the gas door please.

22:40.817 --> 22:41.860
Gas door.

22:44.362 --> 22:45.197
Where is it?

22:49.326 --> 22:51.244
Where is the gas door?

22:51.953 --> 22:53.288
Where could it be?

22:53.371 --> 22:56.208
You can't find the gas door?
I'll help you.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.210
There you go.

22:58.543 --> 23:01.004
-Thank you.
-Okay, three million won.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.841
Eun-jae. Bring your stuff.

23:22.818 --> 23:26.071
-Why aren't you getting in?
-You get in first.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.084
Were you thirsty?

23:46.174 --> 23:47.884
-Hold on.
-Why?

23:48.385 --> 23:49.594
The bill is wrong.

23:50.804 --> 23:53.265
-Just go.
-Is it off by a lot?

24:08.071 --> 24:09.489
I was mistaken.

24:10.907 --> 24:12.868
I didn't want to look so petty.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.287
From now on,

24:15.787 --> 24:17.789
don't make mistakes like that.

24:19.332 --> 24:22.002
-Are we good? I'm taking off.
-Okay.

24:33.972 --> 24:36.183
This and this are a perfect match.

24:36.266 --> 24:37.726
Perfect.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.228
Make a right turn onto the rotary.

24:40.645 --> 24:43.565
Then take the road at ten o'clock
towards Seoul.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.986
Keep it down! I can't hear the GPS system.

24:48.069 --> 24:50.614
Then take the road at ten o'clock
towards Seoul.

24:51.531 --> 24:52.699
Turn right, then what?

24:52.782 --> 24:54.910
Make a right turn onto the rotary.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.289
-No!
-What happened?

24:59.372 --> 25:00.790
We lost our GPS!

25:00.874 --> 25:03.293
-No!
-We're screwed!

25:03.376 --> 25:05.378
-How do we go home?
-Where are we?

25:05.462 --> 25:06.796
I have a charger.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.674
-You should've said that sooner!
-Hurry.

25:10.258 --> 25:11.551
No one else has a GPS app?

25:11.635 --> 25:13.678
Why would we? We don't have cars.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.847
Who heard what it said after the rotary?

25:15.931 --> 25:18.391
-It said ten o'clock.
-Where's that?

25:18.475 --> 25:20.143
-That way.
-Here.

25:21.436 --> 25:22.979
-No.
-Wait.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.981
-There.
-There!

25:25.065 --> 25:27.067
-Hold on.
-You went too far.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.861
-That's not...
-Be quiet.

25:32.948 --> 25:35.408
-Just go for now.
-Go where?

25:35.492 --> 25:38.745
If you go out that way, there must be
a road going the opposite way.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.293
Drive slowly.

25:52.467 --> 25:54.928
Wow, Jin-myung. You're the best.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.681
You look straight, Yi-na.

26:20.036 --> 26:21.496
We're going so far in.

26:22.038 --> 26:23.707
The road is weird.

26:24.874 --> 26:26.334
Is this the right way?

26:45.145 --> 26:46.688
It's so dark.

26:47.605 --> 26:49.566
I know. There are no street lamps either.

26:50.358 --> 26:52.986
Wouldn't it be better
to turn on the headlights?

26:54.696 --> 26:55.739
Look for the switch.

26:56.406 --> 26:59.409
-You don't know where it is?
-I've never driven at night.

27:04.706 --> 27:07.167
What the heck? It was so easy to find.

27:07.250 --> 27:09.669
Shouldn't the phone be charged by now?

27:16.593 --> 27:17.677
Please...

27:19.346 --> 27:21.931
-Password.
-It's 0416?

27:26.895 --> 27:28.104
There's no reception.

27:29.606 --> 27:30.607
Shouldn't we turn back?

27:30.690 --> 27:32.400
Here? I can't.

27:32.567 --> 27:33.902
Just go straight for now.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.779
What if the road ends?

27:35.862 --> 27:38.198
-It won't end.
-Really?

27:39.240 --> 27:40.241
Probably.

27:42.577 --> 27:43.703
Please...

27:54.798 --> 27:56.591
BEWARE OF THE SURFACE

28:08.478 --> 28:10.146
BEWARE OF WILD ANIMALS

28:20.073 --> 28:21.741
BEWARE OF MINES

28:34.796 --> 28:35.713
BED AND BREAKFAST

28:36.714 --> 28:38.258
What?

28:38.466 --> 28:39.426
Did you see that?

28:40.009 --> 28:40.927
-What?
-See what?

28:41.010 --> 28:42.011
What's wrong?

28:42.095 --> 28:44.305
I thought I saw a person. You didn't see?

28:44.389 --> 28:45.432
-A person?
-Yes.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.142
A person here?

28:47.225 --> 28:48.643
What are you talking about?

28:59.112 --> 29:00.321
-Light!
-Where?

29:00.405 --> 29:01.698
-There.
-What is it?

29:03.116 --> 29:04.784
-We're saved!
-Yes!

29:05.285 --> 29:06.911
Let's go!

29:21.801 --> 29:23.094
What are you going to do?

29:23.178 --> 29:25.305
What else? I can't drive anymore.

29:25.388 --> 29:28.433
-We'll sleep here tonight.
-How much are these kinds of places?

29:28.516 --> 29:31.060
They're usually at least
500,000 won a night.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.438
Whatever. I can't drive anymore.

29:37.609 --> 29:38.651
Excuse me.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.530
Excuse me.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.167
-Who...
-Hello.

29:55.835 --> 29:58.630
You let us cut in
at the intersection earlier.

30:00.256 --> 30:01.966
Did I?

30:02.759 --> 30:04.594
Can we stay here for the night?

30:06.721 --> 30:09.224
Well, we haven't cleaned...

30:09.724 --> 30:12.727
We're closed for the time being. Sorry.

30:16.272 --> 30:19.984
-Then may I make just one phone call?
-What?

30:20.568 --> 30:22.362
We can't get reception here.

30:24.781 --> 30:27.116
I'm a novice driver,
so I don't know the roads.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.494
I want to ask someone to pick us up.

30:30.036 --> 30:31.037
Please.

30:32.330 --> 30:33.915
Well...

30:36.835 --> 30:40.672
Then just stay the night,
although the rooms aren't ready.

30:40.755 --> 30:42.257
A novice shouldn't drive at night.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.676
Thank you.

30:46.511 --> 30:47.971
How much is it?

30:49.514 --> 30:50.723
It's 100,000 won.

30:51.558 --> 30:54.269
-What?
-Really?

30:56.688 --> 30:59.274
I haven't cleaned yet,
so I should give you a discount.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.317
How about 50,000 won?

31:05.697 --> 31:07.490
-Give him the money.
-Okay.

31:26.301 --> 31:27.760
We need the key.

31:31.472 --> 31:35.894
Getting five beautiful guests like this
got me all confused.

31:38.229 --> 31:39.314
Just a minute.

31:45.653 --> 31:46.988
It's so cheap.

31:47.071 --> 31:48.072
That's crazy cheap.

31:48.156 --> 31:52.201
When I went with my club,
it was 500,000 won for a crappier place.

31:52.785 --> 31:54.829
Don't be obvious. He may ask for more.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.581
Maybe it's super ghetto inside.

32:08.384 --> 32:10.637
Okay. Enjoy your stay.

32:11.804 --> 32:13.598
-Good night.
-Thank you.

32:28.738 --> 32:30.281
There are two rooms upstairs!

32:33.952 --> 32:36.913
-There must be an herb garden...
-The bathroom rocks!

32:36.996 --> 32:38.456
There's a Jacuzzi!

32:38.623 --> 32:41.417
Isn't the owner so nice?

32:43.628 --> 32:46.422
Let's not make it obvious.
He may ask for more.

33:28.548 --> 33:29.799
Don't worry.

33:32.927 --> 33:34.345
Be happy.

33:52.613 --> 33:53.740
I'm hungry.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.202
I'm hungry.

33:59.245 --> 34:00.413
I'm hungry.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.541
All I ate today was a lump
of cold rice in the morning.

34:05.918 --> 34:10.548
So what? At least you guys ate
some clementine and chips in the car.

34:10.631 --> 34:12.133
Get up.

34:12.967 --> 34:15.720
My back hurts from sitting in the middle.

34:17.930 --> 34:19.015
What?

34:19.849 --> 34:23.561
"We will fire up the barbecue for you
for 10,000 won.

34:24.729 --> 34:26.647
You may order meat and vegetables."

34:45.083 --> 34:46.876
-Sir!
-Sir!

34:46.959 --> 34:49.879
We want a barbecue! We want meat!

34:49.962 --> 34:51.464
-We want a lot!
-Shoot.

34:52.423 --> 34:54.133
Sir!

34:57.220 --> 34:59.931
We want a barbecue. We want meat too.

35:00.014 --> 35:01.099
Meat?

35:02.517 --> 35:05.770
You want a barbecue, is that it?

35:08.397 --> 35:09.524
How much?

35:10.691 --> 35:12.860
About 28,500 won worth.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.489
That's all we have.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.367
Give us just that much.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.794
All right.

35:29.877 --> 35:32.296
I'll bring it over. Go back and wait.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.006
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

35:35.383 --> 35:36.342
But...

35:39.053 --> 35:41.806
I'm sorry for saying this
in this situation,

35:43.683 --> 35:45.810
-but if you have leftover rice...
-Hey.

35:47.436 --> 35:50.148
Rather than that, if you have
sauce and garlic...

35:50.231 --> 35:51.732
You guys have no shame.

35:52.316 --> 35:53.609
Don't mind them.

35:53.985 --> 35:54.902
Thank you.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.613
-I can't eat meat without garlic!
-Hey.

35:58.573 --> 36:00.575
-Seriously.
-Rice is better.

36:01.242 --> 36:02.994
I want kimchi.

36:03.077 --> 36:04.662
I haven't had kimchi in three months.

36:04.745 --> 36:06.747
I'm sure he'll give us that.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.082
I'm sure he has kimchi.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.417
I'm sure he does.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.952
It's 28,500 won worth.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.393
Sorry. I forgot.

37:12.813 --> 37:13.898
Where's the charcoal?

37:15.858 --> 37:17.360
On the balcony.

37:18.194 --> 37:20.029
Okay. My bad.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.458
It's so yummy.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.711
There's more charcoal here if you need.

37:36.128 --> 37:37.964
How long have you been running this place?

37:38.256 --> 37:40.091
-Not long.
-Should we take a picture?

37:40.591 --> 37:44.553
I retired and decided
I belong in the mountains.

37:44.637 --> 37:46.514
The buildings don't look new.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.433
You can adjust the flame from down here.

37:50.142 --> 37:52.395
-Is that for your blog?
-That's nice.

37:52.478 --> 37:54.855
We must share the word
about this nice place.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.232
Get in the picture.

37:59.986 --> 38:01.487
-Okay.
-Us too?

38:02.571 --> 38:03.739
One, two.

38:04.657 --> 38:05.908
That looks good.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.285
The kimchi tastes great.

38:07.368 --> 38:08.744
-It does?
-Yes.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.579
Enjoy.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.085
If only we had alcohol.

38:16.585 --> 38:18.629
I'll totally faint if I drink now.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.089
-Me too.
-Totally.

38:20.172 --> 38:21.841
-Me too.
-That would be great.

38:21.924 --> 38:23.175
We'll do the rest.

38:23.259 --> 38:24.885
-Do you want to?
-Sure.

38:24.969 --> 38:27.013
Okay. Enjoy your dinner.

38:27.096 --> 38:28.973
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

38:30.474 --> 38:33.811
Cook. Cook quickly.

38:39.066 --> 38:41.527
The meat tastes great.

38:42.194 --> 38:44.071
I'll give them marketing on my blog.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.531
A blog.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.242
That's not good.

39:17.355 --> 39:18.522
It's 38 years.

39:22.777 --> 39:24.820
It's too rich, eating just meat.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.238
Then stop eating.

39:26.822 --> 39:29.825
Did you bring any alcohol?
Let's open it if you did.

39:30.826 --> 39:32.036
I didn't.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.331
Is it good?

39:35.414 --> 39:36.957
-Yes.
-It's delicious.

39:38.751 --> 39:41.545
I got this as a gift from someone,

39:41.796 --> 39:44.006
but I quit drinking because of my health.

39:44.590 --> 39:46.842
I don't want to throw it away,

39:46.926 --> 39:49.387
but it keeps tempting me
whenever I see it.

39:50.638 --> 39:52.890
Why don't you have some?

39:53.599 --> 39:54.558
Hallelujah.

39:54.683 --> 39:55.976
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.853
-Thank you.
-Okay, then.

39:58.354 --> 39:59.688
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

40:00.898 --> 40:02.650
What a beautiful world.

40:02.733 --> 40:05.569
This is it. That Royal thing.

40:05.653 --> 40:07.196
It's 20,000 won per glass.

40:08.364 --> 40:10.032
Then how much is this worth?

40:11.450 --> 40:13.786
It's worth over 500,000 won.

40:13.869 --> 40:16.080
-Wow.
-That's too much.

40:17.164 --> 40:18.833
Maybe that man

40:21.877 --> 40:24.630
doesn't know this costs that much.

40:25.464 --> 40:28.134
Probably. Let's drink
before he asks for it back.

40:28.217 --> 40:30.511
-Okay.
-No. He's totally smitten with us.

40:31.262 --> 40:34.181
Let's get it straight. It's me.

40:34.890 --> 40:37.268
Maybe we should sell it.

40:40.896 --> 40:42.857
Drink!

42:25.251 --> 42:26.252
Hey, Ji-won!

42:28.462 --> 42:29.797
What is it?

42:30.673 --> 42:32.675
Where are you, Ji-won? Get out here!

42:34.218 --> 42:36.011
What is it?

42:36.303 --> 42:37.805
Did she do something wrong?

42:40.849 --> 42:42.268
Ji-won, get up!

42:43.477 --> 42:45.980
-Why?
-Take this.

42:47.940 --> 42:48.899
It's your gift.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.443
A gift from my trip to China.

42:51.944 --> 42:55.823
It's a keychain. So what?
What will you do about it?

42:55.906 --> 42:57.700
What will you do about it?

43:00.202 --> 43:01.328
You guys too. Take it.

43:02.329 --> 43:03.664
Even if you don't want it.

43:07.167 --> 43:08.460
You have anything to say?

43:10.588 --> 43:11.714
Thanks.

43:12.881 --> 43:15.050
-Thank you.
-And you?

43:16.885 --> 43:18.137
Thanks.

43:19.763 --> 43:20.764
Okay.

43:22.224 --> 43:23.225
That's all.

43:25.436 --> 43:26.520
Sleep.

43:40.784 --> 43:42.536
Jin-myung, you silly girl.

43:43.495 --> 43:46.248
You're sensitive about strange things.

44:10.981 --> 44:12.274
Hey, Eun-jae Yoo.

44:13.192 --> 44:14.693
What now?

44:14.777 --> 44:17.279
The youngest is supposed to sit
in the middle.

44:18.739 --> 44:20.032
What are you talking about?

44:20.616 --> 44:22.826
Are you going to do that again?

44:23.327 --> 44:25.162
Okay.

44:25.746 --> 44:26.914
I'll sit there.

44:28.207 --> 44:29.500
That's what I'm talking about.

44:35.089 --> 44:37.591
What is she talking about?

44:55.567 --> 44:56.527
Damn it.

44:59.530 --> 45:01.281
Why do you always cut me off?

45:01.865 --> 45:03.826
You don't do that to anyone else.

45:04.118 --> 45:05.661
Do you look down on me?

45:06.829 --> 45:10.082
Sorry. I was wrong.

45:10.999 --> 45:12.251
Watch it.

46:02.092 --> 46:03.844
Why does my cheek hurt so much?

46:29.620 --> 46:31.455
JINGWANG BED AND BREAKFAST

46:42.674 --> 46:44.134
Damn it.

46:49.806 --> 46:51.141
Damn it.

47:11.912 --> 47:13.497
SLEEPING PILLS

47:24.841 --> 47:26.218
Take care of yourself.

47:39.898 --> 47:43.068
-When are you heading out?
-We should leave soon.

47:45.404 --> 47:48.073
-Here, drink this.
-Thank you.

47:53.495 --> 47:55.914
Go straight to hit the interstate, right?

47:56.290 --> 47:58.667
That's right. It's a sharp turn,
so be careful.

47:59.251 --> 48:00.210
Thank you.

48:21.815 --> 48:24.484
-Are you up?
-Yes. You must've been tired yesterday.

48:24.568 --> 48:27.029
I slept soundly. Here, drink this.

48:29.656 --> 48:31.408
It's to thank you for the keychain.

48:38.123 --> 48:39.458
Ji-won, get up!

48:40.375 --> 48:41.627
Take this.

48:42.669 --> 48:45.005
It's a keychain. So what?

48:49.176 --> 48:51.595
-Are you up?
-Yes.

48:56.642 --> 48:57.851
About last night.

48:59.186 --> 49:00.771
What about last night?

49:02.022 --> 49:03.482
You don't remember?

49:04.941 --> 49:06.151
I remember.

49:07.194 --> 49:09.780
You threw a fit at me.

49:12.491 --> 49:14.409
I was totally shocked.

49:14.493 --> 49:16.161
I realized

49:16.662 --> 49:20.332
that you were a person, not a robot.

49:22.125 --> 49:24.252
I must still be jetlagged.

49:24.461 --> 49:26.963
-Sorry.
-Not a problem.

49:27.214 --> 49:28.507
Do you want some coffee?

49:30.676 --> 49:31.718
Thanks.

49:33.512 --> 49:35.681
-Wash up and come out.
-Okay.

49:42.729 --> 49:43.897
Hot.

49:45.941 --> 49:47.609
Ji-won.

49:48.110 --> 49:49.486
I'm in here.

49:50.362 --> 49:52.114
We're leaving soon.

49:52.364 --> 49:53.323
Give me a minute.

49:53.407 --> 49:55.492
If you're late, you sit in the middle.

49:55.575 --> 49:58.286
Okay. Do you want the coffee?

50:02.791 --> 50:05.252
-Hey. They said to hurry up.
-Okay.

50:08.505 --> 50:11.591
Why does my cheek hurt so much?
Did something happen last night?

50:13.468 --> 50:14.970
Do you want this?

50:15.721 --> 50:17.597
What is it? Coffee?

50:18.640 --> 50:19.474
Thanks.

50:21.059 --> 50:22.602
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

50:27.607 --> 50:28.525
It's all cold.

50:34.156 --> 50:37.492
What are you doing?
Everyone's waiting. Hurry up.

50:38.744 --> 50:40.162
Okay.

50:42.372 --> 50:43.874
Seriously.

50:47.627 --> 50:49.796
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.757
-Drive safely.
-Thank you.

50:51.840 --> 50:53.216
Thank you.

50:55.135 --> 50:56.386
Thank you.

50:57.846 --> 51:00.432
-Are you going now?
-Yes. We had a great time.

51:00.515 --> 51:02.434
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

51:08.398 --> 51:10.859
Have some coffee. I made it.

51:10.942 --> 51:12.903
You didn't have to.

51:12.986 --> 51:14.613
Thank you. We'll be back.

51:15.197 --> 51:17.657
-Get back safely.
-Thank you. Goodbye.

51:51.525 --> 51:53.360
Your driving improved a lot.

51:53.443 --> 51:55.779
Of course. I have great reflexes.

51:55.862 --> 51:58.448
That man seems like a great person.

51:58.615 --> 51:59.866
-He does.
-Right?

52:03.119 --> 52:04.371
It was so cheap.

52:04.746 --> 52:05.705
That's a rare find.

52:05.789 --> 52:08.041
-I know. It makes no sense.
-I was shocked.

52:08.124 --> 52:09.918
-For the house?
-Right?

53:29.748 --> 53:32.250
-Welcome home!
-Here we are!

53:33.293 --> 53:35.128
I almost forgot.

53:36.796 --> 53:38.715
Come here, Jin-myung.

53:38.798 --> 53:41.092
-Hurry.
-Hurry.

53:42.469 --> 53:44.387
Welcome back!

53:48.892 --> 53:50.143
Hold on.

53:51.811 --> 53:54.064
-Okay. One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

53:58.610 --> 54:00.528
-One more.
-One more.

54:01.696 --> 54:03.281
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

54:04.866 --> 54:07.661
I'm so happy!

54:08.912 --> 54:10.246
You got a cake?

54:10.330 --> 54:12.040
-I didn't know about this.
-A cake.

54:12.123 --> 54:15.251
-You bought it?
-Since all five of us are here.

54:21.174 --> 54:23.343
We are whole again.

54:23.426 --> 54:24.552
We're invincible!

54:24.636 --> 54:26.930
-We have to split up again.
-What?

54:28.014 --> 54:29.891
I'm moving.
I was going to tell you yesterday.

54:38.817 --> 54:40.110
Why?

54:40.276 --> 54:45.740
My boss opened a shop in Suwon,
and he told me to run it.

54:46.324 --> 54:48.243
-But...
-When are you leaving?

54:49.786 --> 54:53.331
I was supposed to leave
early this morning.

54:54.332 --> 54:56.710
But I wanted to blow out
the candles together.

54:56.793 --> 54:58.253
That's not right!

55:00.380 --> 55:02.590
Why not? It's fine.

55:53.266 --> 55:56.102
Why are you crying? This isn't a big deal.

55:56.186 --> 55:58.605
I'm not leaving the country.
It's just Suwon.

55:59.105 --> 56:00.023
Still.

56:01.066 --> 56:03.234
I'm not leaving for good. I'll come visit.

56:04.360 --> 56:06.696
It's still different from living together.

56:07.530 --> 56:09.657
Some days you'll visit,
some days you won't.

56:10.241 --> 56:12.035
Then you won't come at all.

56:12.994 --> 56:15.038
That's how people split up.

56:16.331 --> 56:17.957
One by one,

56:18.625 --> 56:20.627
we'll all split up.

56:25.298 --> 56:26.341
Eun-jae.

56:29.469 --> 56:30.929
Don't go.

56:36.768 --> 56:38.812
You won't forget me, will you?

56:39.854 --> 56:42.482
Don't you forget me.
I'll kill you if you do.

56:43.149 --> 56:44.484
I won't.

56:45.110 --> 56:47.362
Call if you need anything.

56:47.946 --> 56:49.697
Visit often. Okay?

56:50.115 --> 56:52.033
Promise. Pinky swear.

56:52.117 --> 56:53.409
Pinky swear.

56:54.327 --> 56:56.913
Thanks for everything, Jin-myung.

56:57.497 --> 56:59.249
What did I do?

56:59.874 --> 57:03.711
Jin-myung, I learned a lot thanks to you.

57:04.629 --> 57:05.964
Don't say that.

57:06.047 --> 57:07.799
I learned more from you.

57:15.598 --> 57:16.683
I'll go.

57:16.891 --> 57:18.059
Bye.

57:32.949 --> 57:34.409
Don't cry.

57:35.493 --> 57:36.327
I love you.

57:36.995 --> 57:40.331
I love you too. I really love you.

57:40.415 --> 57:42.459
Don't forget me.

57:43.001 --> 57:45.211
-We won't forget you.
-Don't worry.

57:45.295 --> 57:46.796
Bye.

57:48.006 --> 57:49.549
Drive safely.

57:49.632 --> 57:51.468
Don't die.

57:53.720 --> 57:55.388
Be careful.

57:55.472 --> 57:58.141
-Make sure to eat well.
-Bye.

57:58.558 --> 58:00.226
Bye.

58:19.078 --> 58:20.205
Bye.

58:29.130 --> 58:30.715
Why aren't you going?

58:31.299 --> 58:32.383
The car won't start.

58:33.635 --> 58:34.761
What?

58:35.803 --> 58:39.140
Look. It's been less than a month
since I bought the car.

58:39.432 --> 58:40.850
Come quickly.

58:41.851 --> 58:42.852
Yes.

58:48.233 --> 58:50.360
The mechanic will be here in an hour.

58:52.362 --> 58:53.571
How stupid.

58:56.533 --> 59:00.745
They caught the remote house serial killer
because he fell asleep.

59:01.829 --> 59:02.872
Really?

59:03.581 --> 59:04.624
How funny.

59:06.543 --> 59:07.544
It's hot.

59:07.961 --> 59:09.128
What the heck?

59:09.504 --> 59:11.464
I cried for nothing.

59:11.548 --> 59:14.968
Our eyes are all puffy.

59:15.051 --> 59:16.553
Just stay the night.

59:17.053 --> 59:18.555
-Yes, stay.
-Sleep here.

59:18.721 --> 59:21.224
Sleep here, Yi-na.

59:22.725 --> 59:25.395
10 MONTHS LATER

59:34.946 --> 59:37.824
YEONNAM-RO 22

59:38.992 --> 59:41.077
Mapo-gu Yeonnam-ro 22, 2nd Floor

1:00:27.790 --> 1:00:29.125
Hello...

1:00:29.208 --> 1:00:31.711
Is this Yeonnam-ro 22?

1:00:31.794 --> 1:00:33.713
-Have you lived with others before?
-No.

1:00:33.796 --> 1:00:35.423
-Do you have any siblings?
-Why?

1:00:35.506 --> 1:00:37.508
A newbie should behave like one.

1:00:37.592 --> 1:00:39.927
What kind of a girl wears only black?

1:00:41.179 --> 1:00:43.848
If others saw you...
Your chemistry was so...

1:00:43.931 --> 1:00:45.600
-What does that mean?
-What?

1:00:45.683 --> 1:00:47.143
She's a disrespectful brat.

1:00:47.727 --> 1:00:49.979
Why should we tip-toe around the newbie?

1:00:50.063 --> 1:00:52.690
-She's very suspicious.
-She's hiding something.

1:00:55.318 --> 1:00:56.194
Is something wrong?

1:00:56.277 --> 1:00:58.363
I got in. I want a kiss.

1:00:58.446 --> 1:00:59.614
-People get angry
-Eun!

1:00:59.697 --> 1:01:01.824
if a secret they want to hide gets out.

1:01:02.867 --> 1:01:04.535
So? What will you do?

1:01:04.619 --> 1:01:06.412
If you find the person.

1:01:06.621 --> 1:01:10.416
Which one of you
ruined someone else's life

1:01:11.167 --> 1:01:12.210
and is laughing now?

1:01:12.335 --> 1:01:14.796
I'll kill you.

1:01:14.879 --> 1:01:17.090
