Hello, hello, thank you,  Now,
there are lambs in the fields

00:49.356 --> 00:53.644
£2,000 and told us we had to
spend  the cars we'd bought down

00:53.684 --> 00:59.768
where we'd be given a
number of challenges.

00:59.808 --> 01:02.240
This is what I bought.

01:02.280 --> 01:06.832
It's a 1987 BMW 325i convertible.

01:06.872 --> 01:10.204
According to the mileometer it's
done 94,000 miles which means the one

01:10.244 --> 01:14.736
thing you can be sure of is
it hasn't done 94,000 miles.

01:14.776 --> 01:17.240
But on the face of it, pretty solid car.

01:17.280 --> 01:20.736
Best of all, it only cost £1,600.

01:20.776 --> 01:23.424
CAR HORN HONKS Oh!

01:23.464 --> 01:26.172
Oh, no.

01:26.212 --> 01:29.488
That's awkward.

01:29.528 --> 01:31.844
That is a 3... Yes.

01:31.884 --> 01:33.000
32... Yeah.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.472
325? Yes.

01:34.512 --> 01:36.784
325. Yes.

01:36.824 --> 01:38.092
How old?

01:38.132 --> 01:41.048
'87. '88. How much? 1,600.

01:41.088 --> 01:43.504
19,950!

01:43.544 --> 01:45.316
How many miles?

01:45.356 --> 01:47.092
94, it says. And?

01:47.132 --> 01:50.608
This "says" 137,000 miles.

01:50.648 --> 01:54.908
I'm pretty pleased with this, at least they didn't
fit stupid after-market wheels on it unlike...

01:54.948 --> 01:59.248
Mine. Yours comes from a good area,
I can tell. Anyone who's got these.

01:59.288 --> 02:02.752
Extra locks. They don't live in
Bourton-on-the-Water, do they?

02:02.792 --> 02:05.000
It's not a Cotswoldian feature, no.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.284
More St Pauls in Bristol,
I'm thinking. Yeah.

02:07.324 --> 02:10.564
This is, well, just superb.

02:10.604 --> 02:13.624
So many different shades ofblack
on there, it's unbelievable.

02:13.664 --> 02:16.064
He's taken care of his car.

02:16.104 --> 02:19.128
Oh ho ho! There, you need that.

02:19.168 --> 02:21.936
Was he delivering paving
slabs one at a time? No.

02:21.976 --> 02:25.220
Why is that there? Because
it improves handling.

02:25.260 --> 02:29.624
'At this point, James arrived
in his four-seater convertible.'

02:29.664 --> 02:35.500
Oh, dear. Oh!

02:35.540 --> 02:40.284
Oh, God! I don't suppose by any
happy chance that's the 318, is it?

02:40.324 --> 02:43.408
It's a 325, sir. Yours?

02:43.448 --> 02:45.880
325. Is it? Yes.

02:45.920 --> 02:47.408
325, yes.

02:47.448 --> 02:49.656
What year is yours? 1989.

02:49.696 --> 02:51.624
How much did you pay? £1,900.

02:51.664 --> 02:55.500
Yours looks pretty standard. It is.
- Except for the rust obviously.

02:55.540 --> 02:57.316
Mine's nice.

02:57.356 --> 02:59.880
Don't do that! I've just fixed that.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.956
I barely touched it!

03:02.996 --> 03:07.908
'So none of us had bought an Audi or a Ford
or a Merc and that looked like a cock-up.

03:07.948 --> 03:11.528
'But then I realised that actually,
- it wasn't.'

03:11.568 --> 03:13.564
I think this is brilliant.

03:13.604 --> 03:15.908
Well, not really.
We've got the same car.

03:15.948 --> 03:18.880
We're always being asked, people
come up to us and say is a Golf

03:18.920 --> 03:22.220
a good used purchase, or a Volvo or
whatever and we always say it depends.

03:22.260 --> 03:24.752
So what we've got here are three cars,

03:24.792 --> 03:27.888
they were made in the same
factory by the same robots

03:27.928 --> 03:32.220
at roughly the same time and they've all been driven in the same
- country by the same sort of people.

03:32.260 --> 03:35.248
So they should be the same. Ah.

03:35.288 --> 03:39.248
But I bet you, I bet you they aren't.

03:39.288 --> 03:43.812
'So we decided to bin the
challenges the producers had devised

03:43.852 --> 03:47.188
'and dream up some of our own.'

03:47.228 --> 03:48.936
Where's Hammond?

03:48.976 --> 03:51.128
Don't know, I think
we've lost him already.

03:51.168 --> 03:54.812
CAR IGNITION FAILING,CAR ALARM SOUNDS

03:54.852 --> 04:00.408
JEREMY AND JAMES LAUGH

04:00.448 --> 04:03.596
No, listen, it's... Let
me hear that sound again.

04:03.636 --> 04:05.472
CAR ALARM SOUNDS

04:05.512 --> 04:08.880
Oh, dear. It keeps doing that.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.784
JEREMY AND JAMES LAUGH

04:11.824 --> 04:15.160
Stop doing that!

04:15.200 --> 04:20.188
'Hammond's cheap after-market alarm
matched his cheap after-market wheels.'

04:20.228 --> 04:22.880
They leach into dry rot,
they leach into the system.

04:22.920 --> 04:26.172
There's wires going everywhere.
Can't you just take it all off?

04:26.212 --> 04:30.064
No. No, because otherwise you could've
stolen a car by just taking the alarm off.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.092
They weren't that stupid in the '80s.

04:32.132 --> 04:35.216
CAR ALARM SOUNDS That's got it.

04:35.256 --> 04:38.468
'Jeremy and I decided to
abandon Hammond and have a race.

04:38.508 --> 04:42.112
'From nought to 100 and
then back to nought again,

04:42.152 --> 04:45.936
'so that we could test our
cars' power and brakes.'

04:45.976 --> 04:50.344
Here are the vital statistics.
2.5 litre straight-six, 170hp,

04:50.384 --> 04:52.688
at least when it was new,
it may have lost a few.

04:52.728 --> 04:56.936
Jeremy has a 2.5 litre
straight-six with 170 horsepower,

04:56.976 --> 04:59.656
or at least when it was new, he
may have lost a few since then.

04:59.696 --> 05:05.656
The difference, he's got a big
slab of concrete in the boot.

05:05.696 --> 05:08.092
It's not the paving stone in
the back I'm worried about,

05:08.132 --> 05:10.328
it's the automatic gearbox.

05:10.368 --> 05:21.216
Doing a drag race with an auto is like doing a
100 metre sprint in wellies. Full of tadpoles.

05:21.256 --> 05:24.656
Yes!

05:24.696 --> 05:28.032
Bit of steering wheel wobble coming in.

05:28.072 --> 05:31.688
No concrete is the answer.

05:31.728 --> 05:36.624
There we go, nought to 60,
that was about 25 seconds.

05:36.664 --> 05:45.596
RICHARD'S CAR ALARM
SOUNDS,FAILS TO START

05:45.636 --> 05:49.936
90!

05:49.976 --> 05:55.528
Must be able to do 100.

05:55.568 --> 05:58.000
And there it is.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.528
There it is.

06:00.568 --> 06:04.092
No brakes, no brakes.

06:04.132 --> 06:06.780
It's just not stopping.

06:06.820 --> 06:11.188
Please, stop!

06:11.228 --> 06:16.624
'The gap between our supposedly
identical BMWs was staggering.'

06:16.664 --> 06:21.064
77, 78, 79, 80, 81.

06:21.104 --> 06:24.752
281 yards.

06:24.792 --> 06:27.440
There is another conclusion we
can draw from this. Which is what?

06:27.480 --> 06:30.188
That as you'd expect, I've
done this properly and I've

06:30.228 --> 06:33.656
proved myself to be better than
you at buying second-hand BMWs.

06:33.696 --> 06:36.408
Well, your brakes are better.

06:36.448 --> 06:39.312
And my engine's better
and my gearbox is better.

06:39.352 --> 06:41.216
Speed isn't everything.

06:41.256 --> 06:43.216
Is it not?

06:43.256 --> 06:46.280
RICHARD'S CAR ALARMCONTINUES TO SOUND

06:46.320 --> 06:51.656
After the race, we got
Hammond's car going again.

06:51.696 --> 06:54.704
And went to a Waking The
Dead-style- forensics lab

06:54.744 --> 07:00.468
to find out in great detail what
sort of life our cars had had.

07:00.508 --> 07:04.624
You know the company we're
using to do this... Mm-hm.

07:04.664 --> 07:07.596
..Are called Manlove Forensics.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.688
Are they? They are. No, they are.

07:09.728 --> 07:11.344
Why are they called that?

07:11.384 --> 07:14.032
Yeah, the boss is called John Manlove.

07:14.072 --> 07:17.484
Oh. Not many fond school-day
memories for him, I bet.

07:17.524 --> 07:22.264
They've actually already discovered
- that your car used to belong to a Muslim man from Birmingham.

07:22.304 --> 07:26.280
What, they can tell that
just from swabbing the seats?

07:26.320 --> 07:30.544
No, they found this
letter in the footwell.

07:30.584 --> 07:35.392
Oh, yes. Addresses to Jamir Masjid,
it's from a mosque in Birmingham.

07:35.432 --> 07:38.124
They're good, they
are good. They're good.

07:38.164 --> 07:42.640
'But the test they were doing went
far beyond looking for old envelopes.'

07:42.680 --> 07:45.608
Do you know what I'm most
worried they'll find in my car?

07:45.648 --> 07:48.360
What? Gentlemen's relish.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.828
I quite like gentlemen's relish.

07:50.868 --> 07:54.688
Oh, you don't mean
the stuff from the jar.

07:54.728 --> 07:58.952
'After many hours, the boss
came over with the results.'

07:58.992 --> 08:01.420
Hi, I'm John Manlove.
Can we stick to John?

08:01.460 --> 08:04.108
Otherwise we're just
going to get giggles.

08:04.148 --> 08:06.092
This vehicle here. This is mine.

08:06.132 --> 08:10.264
This had crisp fragments in it. Crisps
is fine, nobody's worried about that.

08:10.304 --> 08:13.672
There was a little bit
of vegetation. Leaves?

08:13.712 --> 08:16.856
Bits-and-pieces such as
that and some flakes of skin.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.688
There'll be mine.

08:18.728 --> 08:21.732
So that's not too bad then. No,
not too bad, fairly standard.

08:21.772 --> 08:24.048
Let's move on, James's car.

08:24.088 --> 08:26.312
Lots of skin in this one.

08:26.352 --> 08:30.484
Including some nice, large flakes of
yellowish skin with some blood staining on.

08:30.524 --> 08:32.672
A scab! Somebody's
picked a scab in your car.

08:32.712 --> 08:35.640
Full of scabs. Go on. Seriously?

08:35.679 --> 08:39.919
Anything else worth note?
Quite a lot of nasal mucus.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.107
That's bogies, he's
talking about bogies.

08:42.148 --> 08:44.328
Were they smeared on the
seat or the sun visor?

08:44.368 --> 08:46.296
Little balls in the footwell.

08:46.336 --> 08:47.968
Shall I just finish James's car?

08:48.008 --> 08:50.516
Was there more? The last one was
that the steering wheel was stained

08:50.556 --> 08:55.528
with a chemical that can be present
- in high quantities in saliva.

08:55.568 --> 09:00.372
Gob. So basically if you're talking and
driving, that's what you may well expect.

09:00.412 --> 09:03.936
So Roy Hattersley owned it? Picked his
scabs off, spat all over your steering wheel

09:03.976 --> 09:07.108
and dropped bogies in large
quantities in your footwell.

09:07.148 --> 09:10.448
I don't even want to
look at your car now!

09:10.488 --> 09:13.876
But then Mr Manlove
came to Hammond's car.

09:13.916 --> 09:19.388
First of all, there was some black sports type-tape
with what turned out to be blood staining on it.

09:19.428 --> 09:22.808
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sports tape
with blood on the end of it?

09:22.848 --> 09:25.296
Somebody's been bound. And murdered.

09:25.336 --> 09:28.688
Again the steering wheel had what
appeared to be saliva staining on it.

09:28.728 --> 09:36.236
And lastly, we had pubic
hairs and faeces present.

09:36.276 --> 09:41.780
I'm sorry, did you say the word "faeces"? What
certainly appeared to be faecal matter, yes.

09:41.820 --> 09:43.088
That's poo, isn't it?

09:43.128 --> 09:45.720
That's poo. Your car's got poo in it.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.420
Is that normal?

09:48.460 --> 09:52.968
It's like driving around in a Moroccan prison,
isn't it, really? In the front of his car.

09:53.008 --> 10:01.000
'After the forensic tests, my
colleagues were very distressed.'

10:01.040 --> 10:04.136
Oh, God.

10:04.176 --> 10:08.360
So we decided to pull over and see which
of our cars- was the most thief-proof.

10:08.400 --> 10:14.236
This meant finding some thieves who
insisted that we pixelate their faces.

10:14.276 --> 10:21.156
Unfortunately the pixelating was done
by a man who'd just had his car nicked.

10:21.196 --> 10:23.592
Our thieves with the pixelated...

10:23.632 --> 10:29.624
chests will now see how quickly they can break into
- the cars and drive them away.

10:29.664 --> 10:32.156
Are you ready, chaps? Here we go.

10:32.196 --> 10:36.856
Three, two, one, go!

10:36.896 --> 10:40.936
'I felt sure at this point that thanks
to the double locks and the immobiliser,

10:40.976 --> 10:44.136
'my car would finally
start to come good.'

10:44.176 --> 10:47.184
I think you'll find they'll
take a while getting in.

10:47.224 --> 10:50.328
He's into mine. Oh, he's into yours!

10:50.368 --> 10:56.688
Yeah, but even though... OK, he's
in, but I think you'll find...

10:56.728 --> 11:01.080
HE STARTS CAR,CAR ALARM SOUNDS

11:01.120 --> 11:04.388
That's ridiculous! That was honestly,

11:04.428 --> 11:07.404
that was just no time.

11:07.444 --> 11:16.156
Your car is now on a cross-Channel
ferry on its way to Uzbekistan.

11:16.196 --> 11:19.044
It really is quite tense
now. Come on, Jeremy's thief.

11:19.084 --> 11:20.700
Come on, James's thief.

11:20.740 --> 11:23.156
Come on, Jeremy's thief.

11:23.196 --> 11:27.388
However after 20 minutes, both our
cars were still where we'd left them.

11:27.428 --> 11:32.124
So we decided to call it a draw.

11:32.164 --> 11:35.932
Unsurprisingly, the thief decided
to return my car which meant he could

11:35.972 --> 11:40.028
explain the reason it was so easy
to-steal is the ignition barrel is all

11:40.068 --> 11:47.264
worn smooth inside so you could start it with
the handle of a teaspoon or a lollipop stick.

11:47.304 --> 11:51.840
I think it has done
more than 94,000 miles.

11:51.880 --> 11:57.280
So far then we'd proved that our identical
cars were in fact completely different.

11:57.320 --> 11:57.328
And that Hammond's was full
of someone else's pubic hair.

11:57.368 --> 12:00.464
APPLAUSE

12:00.504 --> 12:01.952
And that Hammond's was full
of someone else's pubic hair.

12:01.992 --> 12:06.264
APPLAUSE

12:06.304 --> 12:09.200
I've washed my hands,
I've washed my hands.

12:09.240 --> 12:13.080
I mean, honestly... Not nice.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.808
Just knowing that. Isn't
it extraordinary when

12:15.848 --> 12:20.280
you buy a used car, you'll do checks-to
make sure the gearbox is working,

12:20.320 --> 12:25.216
the differential isn't all brokenbut you don't
do anything to check the state of the interior.

12:25.256 --> 12:29.416
It's really weird because I could cope if
I thought a car had missed a service or two

12:29.456 --> 12:36.720
or something like that but once I found out that
one was full of nasal mucus, I'd have walked away.

12:36.760 --> 12:40.292
Has anyone here bought
a used car recently?

12:40.332 --> 12:43.136
Nobody's bought a used car?

12:43.176 --> 12:44.668
So you bought a used car?

12:44.708 --> 12:47.368
Yes. And did you check it out for...

12:47.408 --> 12:52.136
Scabs? Scabs? Blood?
No. Faeces? Nothing, no.

12:52.176 --> 12:54.292
You're from Liverpool? Liverpool.

12:54.332 --> 12:57.796
I said bought, anyone here bought!

12:57.836 --> 13:00.684
Oh, here we go again! You have?

13:00.724 --> 13:03.528
Did you check out if it's
got any finance owing on it?

13:03.568 --> 13:06.436
Finance. You did finance, you did
checks on the mechanical components?

13:06.476 --> 13:11.044
I did. Did you see if there were anybody
else's bottom mushrooms growing in the carpet?

13:11.084 --> 13:15.700
No. You didn't. I'm very surprised,
- I'm really quite surprised. Anyway we're going to pick it up later on.

13:15.740 --> 13:17.808
Now we ought to do the news.

13:17.848 --> 13:20.216
Can I just talk about speed
cameras, does anybody mind?

13:20.256 --> 13:22.904
You know Oxfordshire Council
announced recently, last year,

13:22.944 --> 13:25.280
it would turn all the speed cameras
- off and when they said that,

13:25.320 --> 13:27.312
all the road safety groups
were running around saying

13:27.352 --> 13:30.952
everybody will be dead in ten
minutes as a result of this.

13:30.992 --> 13:35.496
Well, six months have now elapsed and the
road safety groups are saying they don't know

13:35.536 --> 13:38.464
what effect the switch-off
has had on accident figures.

13:38.504 --> 13:42.748
How can they not know?
They say they're not in yet.

13:42.788 --> 13:46.436
But I always know pretty much
immediately when I've had an accident.

13:46.476 --> 13:50.368
There are clues, big noise,
sudden stop, that sort of thing.

13:50.408 --> 13:52.840
The thing is they may not know but
I do because I've done some digging.

13:52.880 --> 13:55.248
In a three-month period in
2009, when the cameras were on,

13:55.288 --> 13:58.728
there were 35 accidents
at speed camera sites.

13:58.768 --> 14:02.136
In the same three-month period
when the cameras were switched off

14:02.176 --> 14:06.028
in 2010, there were 35
accidents at speed camera sites.

14:06.068 --> 14:09.216
No difference. No difference at all.

14:09.256 --> 14:14.932
What about fatalities? Fatalities, there were none
with the cameras on and none with the cameras off.

14:14.972 --> 14:20.528
Really? What's interesting about this is that you'd
think this made no difference and saved the council

14:20.568 --> 14:24.808
a fortune by getting rid of the speed cameras.
They're now saying the police are going to take over

14:24.848 --> 14:30.324
running them and turn them back on again in April. I thought they said
- they couldn't afford to run them?

14:30.364 --> 14:33.120
No, the police are doing it.

14:33.160 --> 14:38.624
But this is very good news because that must mean
they've solved all the other crimes. What, the police?

14:38.664 --> 14:44.608
Actually, they haven't solved them all but they have caught that bloke
- who nicked the lead off my roof.

14:44.648 --> 14:47.388
You had lead stolen from your roof?

14:47.428 --> 14:54.136
All of it. Only you would be the
victim of a crime from the 1950s.

14:54.176 --> 14:58.212
Was the villain chased by a black and white
policeman blowing a whistle by any chance?

14:58.252 --> 15:01.184
Yes. Was he driving a Ford Zephyr?

15:01.224 --> 15:07.388
The thing is I live in Oxfordshire and I was burgled
recently and they haven't caught her yet. Her?

15:07.428 --> 15:12.280
I'm not sexist. Nice touch. Good work.

15:12.320 --> 15:15.184
See? We're not.

15:15.224 --> 15:20.728
You might have seen in the news Formula One driver
Robert Kubicainjured horribly in a rally crash.

15:20.768 --> 15:24.248
He probably won't be watching
but his family in Poland might be

15:24.288 --> 15:27.700
and we did want to say we wish youall the very best,
hope you recoversoon and get back behind the wheel.

15:27.740 --> 15:30.136
Yes, he's a terrific driver,
really is, Robert, and I'm

15:30.176 --> 15:33.684
sure everybody here will join in
wishing him a very speedy recovery.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.872
Yeah, we do. Get well soon.

15:35.912 --> 15:42.044
APPLAUSE

15:42.084 --> 15:44.436
I'd like, if you don't
mind, to talk about magpies.

15:44.476 --> 15:46.416
It's a car show, Jeremy.

15:46.456 --> 15:51.760
Bear with me, because there's an organisation
called the Songbird Survival Trust.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.292
They're calling for a cull on magpies.

15:54.332 --> 15:57.416
They're not calling it a cull, they're
saying they want to do an experiment.

15:57.456 --> 16:01.212
Is it an experiment to see what happens
to a magpie if you fire a shotgun at it?

16:01.252 --> 16:03.028
Yes, it is, basically.

16:03.068 --> 16:06.152
I agree with them on this but for different reasons.
They say if you get rid of magpies then we'll

16:06.192 --> 16:11.152
have more songbirds because magpies
- eat songbirds but there's a better reason than that I can think of.

16:11.192 --> 16:14.776
Magpies are a menace to road safety.

16:14.816 --> 16:19.888
They look like they'd be bad don'tthey? Stupid idiot, listen, drivers,
- I'm not a superstitious man.

16:19.928 --> 16:23.448
I can walk under a ladder,
put my head in a lion's mouth.

16:23.488 --> 16:26.480
That's not a superstition,
you idiot, it's a bad idea.

16:26.520 --> 16:30.696
I can put a hat on my new shoes, all
those things but I do salute magpies. OK?

16:30.736 --> 16:34.388
The problem is because the magpie is
the only bird in Britain these days,

16:34.428 --> 16:37.808
you're just driving along
doing this the whole time.

16:37.848 --> 16:42.464
No, you don't just salute, if yousee a single magpie,
one on its own,-you have to say "morning, captain"

16:42.504 --> 16:47.200
three times. Morning, captain,morning, captain,
morning, captain,salute three times, spit three times,

16:47.240 --> 16:50.496
touch your right elbow with your
left hand, one, two, three times

16:50.536 --> 16:53.400
and then lick your thumb and make a cross in
the top right-hand corner of the windscreen.

16:53.440 --> 16:57.668
You don't have to do that. You do. Do you do
that when you see a magpie? Every single time.

16:57.708 --> 17:01.728
It's quite a faff and it'sdifficult on
the bike but I do it. Morning, captain...

17:01.768 --> 17:06.291
one, two, three, and then you carry on.

17:06.332 --> 17:10.152
You've both got that completely wrong
because what you're supposed to do,

17:10.192 --> 17:14.136
it's only the first magpie of the day and
you salute and say "morning, Mr Magpie",

17:14.175 --> 17:16.640
and you don't do it in the
afternoon because that's bad luck

17:16.680 --> 17:17.932
and you don't do the second one...

17:17.972 --> 17:23.588
Rubbish! How do you know it's the first magpie
of the day? You don't join the Village People.

17:23.627 --> 17:25.796
Is anyone here Jewish?

17:25.836 --> 17:28.167
Yep. You are, where's Jewish, hands up?

17:28.208 --> 17:30.416
You are? Do you know
what we're talking about?

17:30.456 --> 17:34.544
Yeah, Newcastle. No, no, no.

17:34.584 --> 17:37.980
It's not Newcastle, I know
where you're going with that.

17:38.020 --> 17:40.640
It's just that our studio director's
Jewish and has no idea what we're

17:40.680 --> 17:43.260
talking about because he
said, perhaps Jews don't do it.

17:43.300 --> 17:45.640
Is anyone else Jewish who has no clue?

17:45.680 --> 17:49.200
You're Jewish, and do you salute
magpies? No, but we know about it.

17:49.240 --> 17:52.040
You know about it but you
don't do it? Interesting.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.232
So it could be a religious
thing. I don't know.

17:54.272 --> 17:57.932
Do Jewish people have more road accidents
as a result of magpies? No, fewer.

17:57.972 --> 18:03.324
Jewish people will have fewer road accidents
because they're not spending all day long doing this.

18:03.364 --> 18:05.948
Anyway, look. To cut to the point here,

18:05.988 --> 18:11.088
whether you do my simple salute which
is correct, or his full Morris dance...

18:11.128 --> 18:12.480
Can't be too careful.

18:12.520 --> 18:15.244
We need to stop it because
the advantages are huge

18:15.284 --> 18:20.356
because if you get rid of magpies, you
have more songbirds so the air sounds nicer.

18:20.396 --> 18:23.200
You've got tits and...
Why did I say tits?

18:23.240 --> 18:26.760
Sparrows and all that sort of
thing and that'd be brilliant

18:26.800 --> 18:29.464
plus we don't have to do that
and that'll make the roads safer.

18:29.504 --> 18:37.232
There we are, Top Gear Top Tip,
kill all magpies and kill them now.

18:37.272 --> 18:41.808
Who told you about the eyes and ears and nose
and chin?I've accumulated them over the years.

18:41.848 --> 18:45.480
For God's sake, nobody tell me any more that
I have to do or I'll add them to my routine.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.288
What you have to do... No!
Take your trousers down,

18:48.328 --> 18:54.932
look at somebody in the next car, preferably
a van driver, and go... That's a tradition.

18:54.972 --> 18:56.920
Hey, listen, listen.

18:56.960 --> 19:02.792
There's a new lightweight Lamborghini
Gallardo Spyder has come along. Here it is.

19:02.832 --> 19:06.200
It's called the Performante. That's
- going to cost you a hundred and...

19:06.240 --> 19:08.416
I can't read that. What's that say?

19:08.456 --> 19:11.400
You poor, knackered old goat.

19:11.440 --> 19:14.212
£188,000. £188,000.

19:14.252 --> 19:20.964
Top speed I do know. 201 mph. Is that possibly
the best-looking car in production right now?

19:21.004 --> 19:23.056
It is a fantastic-looking car.

19:23.096 --> 19:28.948
The problem is it's getting quite old and compared
to the Ferrari 458, it just feels old fashioned.

19:28.988 --> 19:31.696
The thing is, this isn't just
a duel now between the Italians,

19:31.736 --> 19:34.544
because the British have
moved in with a new McLaren.

19:34.584 --> 19:39.560
Yes, it's called the MP4-12C.

19:39.600 --> 19:44.544
We've got it here in the studio and
- this is the first time we've been able to have a proper look at it.

19:44.584 --> 19:49.696
It has McLaren's own engine,
a 3.8 litre twin-turbo V8.

19:49.736 --> 19:54.260
It also has very sophisticated
computer-controlled suspension.

19:54.300 --> 19:58.760
And, most interestingly, it was
tested here at the Top Gear test track.

19:58.800 --> 20:03.212
We should stress we had nothing to do with
the testing or development of it at all.

20:03.252 --> 20:08.696
No, nothing whatsoever. The thing that bothers me,
Hammond, is I've driven the 458 a lot, as you know.

20:08.736 --> 20:11.728
I love it and I cannot
see how this can be better.

20:11.768 --> 20:14.056
I know, but what if it is?

20:14.096 --> 20:18.056
There are a few pointers. For one
thing, it's cheaper than the 458.

20:18.096 --> 20:23.492
You can't get in! I can.It's also more powerful,
592 brakehorse power, which is 30 or so more.

20:23.532 --> 20:29.152
These are good signs. I like it in here because
they've made the steering wheel the steering wheel.

20:29.192 --> 20:33.368
They haven't fallen into that trap of putting
buttons all over it to make it feel like Formula 1.

20:33.408 --> 20:37.432
They don't make you choose on your instrument
panel between the speedometer and the sat nav

20:37.472 --> 20:42.920
like Ferrari do. All that stuff they put here, and
your music, on a sort of iPad thing in the middle.

20:42.960 --> 20:45.964
It's a fantastic place to be.

20:46.004 --> 20:52.040
My only problem with this really is,
- I like a supercar to look a bit crazy, a bit mad, like a Zonda.

20:52.080 --> 20:55.008
If you ask me, this is sort of plain.

20:55.048 --> 20:57.168
You say Zonda, but
which Zonda do you mean?

20:57.208 --> 21:03.088
Well, the Pagani Zonda as opposedto
the Kia Zonda or the Ford Zonda.

21:03.128 --> 21:09.184
No, you see, over the years,
there have been thousands of them.

21:09.224 --> 21:14.604
The saga began 12 years ago when Pagani launched this
- Genesis.

21:14.644 --> 21:19.948
The very brilliant
and very dramatic C12.

21:19.988 --> 21:24.744
A year later, they introduced a
slightly faster version called the C12S,

21:24.784 --> 21:27.868
and we saw that it was good.

21:27.908 --> 21:33.288
Then there was the Roadster
S and the Monza, and the F,

21:33.328 --> 21:36.320
and the F Roadster.

21:36.360 --> 21:43.744
And then, just when we thought every
angle had been explored, the F Clubsport.

21:43.784 --> 21:49.432
We imagined that this would be
the final Zonda, the final encore.

21:49.472 --> 22:01.616
But we were wrong.

22:01.656 --> 22:09.056
Welcome, everyone, to the
Zonda R, the last of the breed.

22:09.096 --> 22:16.088
And by far the most confusing.

22:16.128 --> 22:19.088
It looks like a pure-bred
racer, but you can't race it,

22:19.128 --> 22:23.568
because there are rules and
regulations in motor sport,

22:23.608 --> 22:28.228
and this meets none of them. And if
- you try to take it on the road,

22:28.268 --> 22:32.276
a policeman is going to stop you and
say, "Sir, where are your indicators

22:32.316 --> 22:38.808
"and why do you not have
any tread on your tyres?"

22:38.848 --> 22:42.256
So if it's not for racing
and it's not for the road,

22:42.296 --> 22:44.928
what is it for?

22:44.968 --> 22:54.808
Well, this.

22:54.848 --> 23:00.200
SPEECH DROWNED OUT BY ENGINE

23:00.240 --> 23:10.008
Annoyingly, the R is so loud that our team of
sound recordists had to have a bit of a rethink.

23:10.048 --> 23:18.432
What I was saying before I had this
microphone fitted is, it really is jolly fast.

23:18.472 --> 23:22.492
Very jolly fast!

23:22.532 --> 23:26.868
Nought to 60 takes three seconds.

23:26.908 --> 23:35.840
Top speed? Nobody knows.
Definitely more than 230 though.

23:35.880 --> 23:44.336
The main reason for all this
phenomenalness is the engine.

23:44.376 --> 23:51.604
It's a six-litre Mercedes V12,
which produces 740 horsepower.

23:51.644 --> 24:03.744
And it's being used to power a car
which weighs less than a Ford Fiesta.

24:03.784 --> 24:13.244
That makes the performance
extremely dramatic!

24:13.284 --> 24:19.616
The Zonda R recently blitzed their
own record at the Nurburgring.

24:19.656 --> 24:24.288
It got round in six
minutes and 47 seconds,

24:24.328 --> 24:32.916
and from where I'm sitting, I
cannot work out why it took so long.

24:32.956 --> 24:38.944
I can only assume the driver stopped
off halfway round to read a book.

24:38.984 --> 24:47.636
Bruce Forsyth could get this thing round
the Nurburgring in less time than that.

24:47.676 --> 24:54.588
All Zondas look like they will be more complicated
to drive than spaceships, but they're not.

24:54.628 --> 24:56.288
They're easy.

24:56.328 --> 25:02.088
And because this one has grippy, slick
tyres, it's the easiest of the lot.

25:02.128 --> 25:05.088
You can whizz about at top speed

25:05.128 --> 25:08.412
and you've got time and
brain power to think,

25:08.452 --> 25:13.508
"I really like the way they've
got these air vents laid out."

25:13.548 --> 25:19.928
That's a nice strap, kind of old
fashioned and modern all at the same time.

25:19.968 --> 25:24.304
It doesn't really matter
if you're not concentrating.

25:24.344 --> 25:26.556
Because it doesn't weigh anything

25:26.596 --> 25:30.460
and because its carbon
brakes are so enormous,

25:30.500 --> 25:43.488
it will go from 125 mph to
a dead stop in 4.3 seconds.

25:43.528 --> 25:47.992
Oh, yeah. Like that.

25:48.032 --> 25:54.804
The only way to stop
faster is to hit a tree.

25:54.844 --> 25:59.728
And this is the first Zonda to
have- a flappy-paddle gearbox.

25:59.768 --> 26:05.692
It isn't the most refined system in the
world, if I'm honest, but it is quick.

26:05.732 --> 26:10.024
And it does mean that when you
floor it, you enjoy the fury

26:10.064 --> 26:16.336
and all you have to do when the fury runs out,
pull the lever and it starts all over again.

26:16.376 --> 26:23.304
Go! Yeah. Go! Go! Yes, go!

26:23.344 --> 26:27.524
Go, go, go!

26:27.564 --> 26:31.164
This car is fantastic.

26:31.204 --> 26:36.276
An extraordinary example of what
can be done when there are no rules.

26:36.316 --> 26:41.444
But for a toy, it is a bit expensive.

26:41.484 --> 26:46.760
The car will cost you £1.46 million,
and because most British racetracks

26:46.800 --> 26:54.400
have noise limits, which this
breaches, you'll need your own.

26:54.440 --> 26:57.524
And the going rate for
one of those these days,

26:57.564 --> 27:03.336
about 6 billion. Billion!

27:03.376 --> 27:12.960
One last go, come on.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.088
Honestly, what a machine.

27:17.128 --> 27:20.412
What a machine.

27:20.452 --> 27:26.368
It seems a shame that we wave goodbye to the
Zonda with a car that is absolutely brilliant,

27:26.408 --> 27:32.744
but also completely useless.

27:32.784 --> 27:35.648
The people at Pagani
obviously thought so too,

27:35.688 --> 27:38.224
because they recently announced

27:38.264 --> 27:42.128
that the R would not be
the last Zonda after all.

27:42.168 --> 27:46.916
They would actually finish by making
five road-going versions of it.

27:46.956 --> 27:55.788
And then they'd really, definitely finish
with five convertible versions of those.

27:55.828 --> 28:02.128
But like a 1970s rock band, they
don't seem to be able to end the song,

28:02.168 --> 28:07.332
because they now say that there
will be another, one last hurrah.

28:07.372 --> 28:11.488
This is it, the Tricolore.

28:11.528 --> 28:14.804
Named after the Italian Air
Force aerobatic squadron,

28:14.844 --> 28:30.052
this too is a quietened
down, softer version of the R.

28:30.092 --> 28:33.944
It's heavier, slightly less powerful,

28:33.984 --> 28:38.276
and thanks to normal - oops -
road tyres, a lot less grippy.

28:38.316 --> 28:41.488
Ha ha!

28:41.528 --> 28:43.960
Oh, dear.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.148
But it's still a great car.

28:48.188 --> 28:54.960
And still properly, properly fast.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.600
Ho, ho, ho!

28:57.640 --> 29:03.896
And because you don't need your own track,
it's about 6 billion less than the R.

29:03.936 --> 29:08.680
That makes it good value.

29:08.720 --> 29:11.992
But of course, what makes this

29:12.032 --> 29:17.804
the best value of all is
that I'm driving Revelations.

29:17.844 --> 29:22.224
The final encore.

29:22.264 --> 29:24.880
Bye-bye, Zonda.

29:24.920 --> 29:42.444
Bye-bye.

29:42.484 --> 29:51.632
APPLAUSE

29:51.672 --> 29:57.768
Poor old Richard Hammond. The Zonda is
his favourite car and now it's all gone.

29:57.808 --> 30:01.176
No, actually, because
after I made that film,

30:01.216 --> 30:06.412
Zonda announced they would make two more
Tricolores. Really? But then it's over?

30:06.452 --> 30:11.896
No, because when they finish doing those,
they're going to make a new one called the 750.

30:11.936 --> 30:16.304
Then that's the last Zonda? No,
because after that... I'm not joking.

30:16.344 --> 30:19.304
They're doing one called the
HH. Then they're going to start

30:19.344 --> 30:22.304
finally building the new
car, the... What's it called?

30:22.344 --> 30:26.412
Huarrr... Yeah, that one. Huayra.

30:26.452 --> 30:31.008
While they're dithering about, making up their
mind, it's time to find out how fast this one,

30:31.048 --> 30:36.616
the R, goes round our track. Of course, that
means handing it over to our tame racing driver.

30:36.656 --> 30:42.928
Some say his nipples are explosive.

30:42.968 --> 30:46.240
And that he's recently had a Mexican...

30:46.280 --> 30:50.024
I mean Brazilian! I mean Brazilian!
- Why did I say that?

30:50.064 --> 30:54.960
I'm sorry, Mr Ambassador. Anyway,
all we know is he's called the Stig.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.804
And he's off. I can't imagine
this is going to take very long.

30:59.844 --> 31:04.520
V12 AMG fury powering towards
the first corner. Here we are.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.332
So much grip in this car.

31:07.372 --> 31:10.024
It is just gliding through.

31:10.064 --> 31:12.804
Bit of a four-wheel drift there.

31:12.844 --> 31:17.304
No stereo, of course,
just 12 cylinders singing.

31:17.344 --> 31:22.116
Actually, not singing, shouting!
Actually very wide through Chicago.

31:22.156 --> 31:25.052
How will he attack Hammerhead?

31:25.092 --> 31:31.648
Leaning hard on those incredible
brakes. Yes. He's nailed it now.

31:31.688 --> 31:37.816
Yes, he's through.

31:37.856 --> 31:40.504
Really open the taps now.

31:40.544 --> 31:43.692
Cuts a steady throttle
through the follow-through.

31:43.732 --> 31:46.912
Unsettled a bit by the bump
on the apex. Stig not scared.

31:46.952 --> 31:51.320
Two corners left. It stays so flat.
- It actually looks undramatic.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.096
Oh, a spit of flame!

31:53.136 --> 31:56.020
Into Gambon and across the line.

31:56.060 --> 32:00.008
APPLAUSE

32:00.048 --> 32:01.760
I have the time here.

32:01.800 --> 32:07.536
He did it in 1:26.7.

32:07.576 --> 32:10.144
No! No, I'm lying.

32:10.184 --> 32:13.400
1:8.5.

32:13.440 --> 32:17.504
CHEERING

32:17.544 --> 32:22.816
The thing is, you may
remember, a couple of years ago,

32:22.856 --> 32:26.196
Michael Schumacher came here
and took a Ferrari FXX round,

32:26.236 --> 32:28.944
which is the same sort
of thing as this, OK?

32:28.984 --> 32:32.348
That was 1:10.7.

32:32.388 --> 32:38.128
So that is 2.2 seconds quicker than Schumacher
in a Ferrari, on slick tyres as well.

32:38.168 --> 32:42.944
Amazing. Either that car
is truly incredible... Or?

32:42.984 --> 32:46.708
The Stig is rather underpaid.

32:46.748 --> 32:50.320
Yes. There's one more thing we have
- to do, I'm afraid. Get rid of it.

32:50.360 --> 32:55.972
Yes, of course. It's not a road
has no place on our board.car.

32:56.012 --> 32:59.144
It's the rules. It's
the rules, I'm afraid.

32:59.184 --> 33:03.320
Let me cheer you up, because it's time now
to put a star in our reasonably-priced car.

33:03.360 --> 33:07.444
In fact, this week, two stars.

33:07.484 --> 33:10.348
These guys, well, they've
fought off zombies in London.

33:10.388 --> 33:13.880
They've had a knife fight in a
supermarket in the West Country.

33:13.920 --> 33:18.040
More recently, they've helped an
alien get back to its home planet.

33:18.080 --> 33:21.848
So they're either actors or
massive liars. Let's find out.

33:21.888 --> 33:24.632
Ladies and gentlemen,
Nick Frost and Simon Pegg!

33:24.672 --> 33:28.004
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

33:28.044 --> 33:30.408
Gentlemen! How are you?

33:30.448 --> 33:33.536
I'm very well. Good to see you.

33:33.576 --> 33:38.972
Look what we've got here.

33:39.012 --> 33:42.048
Great to see you, guys. Great to see.

33:42.088 --> 33:46.600
You two have known each other for donkey's years,
haven't you? Yes. 17-18 years. Met in a restaurant?

33:46.640 --> 33:49.348
Yes, Mexican restaurant.

33:49.388 --> 33:52.252
LAUGHTER I can never go back now.

33:52.292 --> 33:56.176
They've ripped up my Golden Fajita Card.

33:56.216 --> 34:00.380
You became friends because you
shared a love of Star Wars noises?

34:00.420 --> 34:03.632
Yeah. That's kind of how we bonded.-We
met because Nick was interested

34:03.672 --> 34:06.160
in being a stand-up comic,
I was a stand-up comic.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.192
We met, went out a
few times. I did this.

34:08.232 --> 34:12.536
HE BEEPS LIKE A STAR WARS ROBOT

34:12.576 --> 34:16.020
Which is a noise that a smalldroid...
I can see you glaze over.

34:16.060 --> 34:19.331
No, I'm quite good at Star
Wars, but I am struggling here.

34:19.371 --> 34:23.864
That's why I fell in love with him,- because
I thought no-one knew about that except me,

34:23.904 --> 34:30.320
and then he did it to me and it was
like he'd sprayed me with his nerd musk.

34:30.360 --> 34:34.600
That was it, then. How loving.

34:34.639 --> 34:38.476
It must be great working
with your friends, I imagine.

34:38.516 --> 34:41.972
I don't know, obviously.

34:42.012 --> 34:44.380
We have the new film,
which is out this week.

34:44.420 --> 34:49.020
Valentine's Day. It's called Paul.

34:49.060 --> 34:53.020
The idea was literally a spitballin the
garden when we were shooting Shaun Of The Dead.

34:53.060 --> 34:58.396
The weather was really bad.Our producer said,
"Can't we shootsomewhere where it's always sunny?"

34:58.436 --> 35:03.020
We thought of the desert, then because of
our nerd minds, we went straight to Area 51.

35:03.060 --> 35:08.288
That became aliens. We said, "OK, there's two guys
and there's analien and they help him get home."

35:08.328 --> 35:12.476
We've got a clip of the
film, which we can look at.

35:12.516 --> 35:17.068
Put... the phone... down.

35:17.108 --> 35:20.536
Ha-ha-ha!

35:20.576 --> 35:23.660
What have you done to him? I didn't
do anything to him. He fainted.

35:23.700 --> 35:25.408
Yeah, but you made him faint.

35:25.448 --> 35:27.628
But it's not like I
set my phaser to faint.

35:27.668 --> 35:30.252
You've got a phaser?! No! Look, listen.

35:30.292 --> 35:32.848
Hey, I really need your help, OK?

35:32.888 --> 35:34.536
Can we get this guy back on your wagon?

35:34.576 --> 35:37.612
HE GIBBERS

35:37.652 --> 35:41.456
Are you an alien? To you, I am, yes.
- Are you going to probe us?

35:41.496 --> 35:43.768
Why does everyone assume
that? What am I doing?

35:43.808 --> 35:49.736
Am I harvesting farts? How much
can I learn from an ass? W-w-what?

35:49.776 --> 35:53.224
I love the alien. He's great,
isn't he? A brilliant alien.

35:53.264 --> 35:58.224
What gave you the idea to make
your alien smoke and swear?

35:58.264 --> 36:02.068
We just liked the idea that he's been on
earth longer than Graham and Clive have.

36:02.108 --> 36:06.348
He's less alien than they are, really.
They're two British guys out of their depth.

36:06.388 --> 36:10.456
He's been hanging round, smoking strong
weed that he gets off the military,

36:10.496 --> 36:13.756
that he claims killed Bob Dylan.

36:13.796 --> 36:19.208
They do say there's aliens in Area 51, don't
they? Yes. Do you actually believe that?

36:19.248 --> 36:21.440
I'm not sure we do. No.

36:21.480 --> 36:27.424
It's very coincidental that people see lots of
flying saucers nearan experimental aircraft facility.

36:27.464 --> 36:30.504
Logically, it's probably planes!

36:30.544 --> 36:35.064
Did you go out to Area 51 to research
it? We did, we did the whole trip.

36:35.104 --> 36:40.768
We got an RV and we drove from Los Angeles
right the way through Nevada and Utah.

36:40.808 --> 36:43.080
Did you meet many lunatics?

36:43.120 --> 36:45.552
A few. Lot of cowboys.

36:45.592 --> 36:50.048
We went to a rodeo,fully
Stetsons, jeans, cowboy boots,

36:50.088 --> 36:53.756
shirts with business on,
felt completely normal.

36:53.796 --> 36:57.848
Thought, this is fine, it's goodto wear this
stuff. I did not feel normal, by the way.

36:57.888 --> 37:03.016
We didn't look like them, but like people dressing
up, pretending to be them. They could smell our fear.

37:03.056 --> 37:06.644
That's because you had a
toy gun on your hip. Pow!

37:06.684 --> 37:10.284
Did you get to drive
your RV across America?

37:10.324 --> 37:15.176
We had to learn how to drive. This is going to sound really BLEEP
- but we had a driver.

37:15.216 --> 37:18.960
What? Neither of us
have ever driven an RV.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.940
The point of it was that we would
be sitting, writing, while America

37:21.980 --> 37:26.376
drifted past and we just
thought, "Let's have a driver."

37:26.416 --> 37:31.252
He was the guy that did that
amazing-handbrake turn in Meet The Fockers.

37:31.292 --> 37:36.892
De Niro's big CIA blacked-out RV.There's a bit
in that when it turns a full handbrake turn.

37:36.932 --> 37:40.488
He was the driver? He left me
driving... We decided to take

37:40.528 --> 37:44.880
a highway because we
were running behind time.

37:44.920 --> 37:50.192
He really needed the toilet, so he left me
at the wheel and I started to lose control.

37:50.232 --> 37:53.488
Nick was going, "Small corrections,
small corrections!" "I can't! I can't!"

37:53.528 --> 37:57.848
Steve came out the toilet,
doing up his flies...

37:57.888 --> 38:03.268
There was the old story of the guy that rented
one, an English guy rented an RV for his holiday.

38:03.308 --> 38:08.940
It said cruise control, so he
put on cruise control. "Lovely!"

38:08.980 --> 38:13.784
Nobody could work out, in the accident,
why he was killed with a kettle in his hand.

38:13.824 --> 38:20.688
Doing 80 mph. Stupid idiot. Anyway, so
look, the lap, this is why you're here.

38:20.728 --> 38:24.968
I know you were nervous, because you thought
that your size would count against you. Yeah.

38:25.008 --> 38:31.408
Whereas you, of course... What do you weigh?
I'm 11.5 stone. My leg weighs that much!

38:31.448 --> 38:36.736
But the thing is, are you very fit?
- At the moment I am, because I'm doing Mission Impossible 4

38:36.776 --> 38:40.580
as we speak, and I'm
sort of having to be...

38:40.620 --> 38:44.816
I'm an agent now, so I need to be on...

38:44.856 --> 38:48.908
I had a long conversation with MrCruise about his appearance on this.
- Still talks about it.

38:48.948 --> 38:52.988
Does he? He is full of Top Gear. He has
such a shallow and empty life, obviously.

38:53.028 --> 38:55.172
But he is obsessed with it.

38:55.212 --> 38:58.532
Nevertheless, whose
lap shall we see first?

38:58.572 --> 39:01.784
Let's have a look, shall
we, at... your lap, Simon.

39:01.824 --> 39:06.768
Come on, Simon. Let's see your lap.
- Here we go.

39:06.808 --> 39:10.328
HE SPLUTTERS

39:10.368 --> 39:13.960
I've changed gear.
That's a good sign. Yep.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.520
Right, first corner.

39:15.560 --> 39:17.112
Nice wide line in there.

39:17.152 --> 39:20.784
New Stig does teach that line.

39:20.824 --> 39:23.704
He does, yeah. Very... Ooh, you're
not using all the road, though.

39:23.744 --> 39:25.892
Come on, you motherhumper.

39:25.932 --> 39:28.144
Mother what? Motherhumper.

39:28.184 --> 39:31.112
Motherhumper? Nice. Watershed language.

39:31.152 --> 39:32.940
That's looking quite tidy.

39:32.980 --> 39:35.988
Where are you going? Oh,
Hammerhead. Let's have a look. Whoa!

39:36.028 --> 39:38.892
That's squirreling underbraking.
That is quite impressive.

39:38.932 --> 39:41.424
Right. Keep it in between the lines.

39:41.464 --> 39:44.064
Just about... Yep.

39:44.104 --> 39:47.644
It's much sportier than the
last one. This is a great car.

39:47.684 --> 39:50.172
See apostrophe Dee.

39:50.212 --> 39:53.172
TYRES SCREECH

39:53.212 --> 39:54.960
That noise. I know.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.924
Ooh, that gives me a funny feeling!

39:57.964 --> 39:59.908
Really?

39:59.948 --> 40:03.328
Whoa! Almost had the back
wheel off the ground there.

40:03.368 --> 40:06.268
Right, second-to-last corner
is where most people go wrong.

40:06.308 --> 40:09.988
That is extremely tidy. Look at that.

40:10.028 --> 40:11.488
And Gambon...

40:11.528 --> 40:14.128
Looking very smooth through there.

40:14.168 --> 40:16.360
And there we are
- we've crossed the line. Lovely.

40:16.400 --> 40:19.112
APPLAUSE

40:19.152 --> 40:24.112
Now...

40:24.152 --> 40:27.192
Before we get on to how you did... Yeah.

40:27.232 --> 40:30.064
..I think we should have
a look at Nick's lap.

40:30.104 --> 40:33.344
OK. Now, Nick, your practices
weren't entirely smooth.

40:33.384 --> 40:37.892
No. I've sat forward already. No, I just
wanted to go for it and see what happened.

40:37.932 --> 40:40.204
Of course, on the
second-to-last corner...

40:40.244 --> 40:42.892
Well, let's have a
look at what happened.

40:42.932 --> 40:45.296
This is ballsy.

40:45.336 --> 40:48.172
Too ballsy, in fact.

40:48.212 --> 40:49.548
LAUGHTER

40:49.588 --> 40:51.736
That's a proper spin! What's that?

40:51.776 --> 40:53.172
Hitting the kerb. You could have rolled!

40:53.212 --> 40:57.608
APPLAUSE That's what I call ballsy.

40:57.648 --> 40:59.376
I think the thing about being in a...

40:59.416 --> 41:01.832
being a big guy in a
small car when you roll it

41:01.872 --> 41:04.600
is there's nowhere for
you to go so it's fine,

41:04.640 --> 41:07.192
you just roll around. You're wedged
- in and your eyes go around. Yeah.

41:07.232 --> 41:09.704
Nick, let's see how you got on.

41:09.744 --> 41:11.048
ENGINE REVS

41:11.088 --> 41:13.800
TYRES SCREECH

41:13.840 --> 41:17.832
Right. Good start.
Ah, that rubber smell.

41:17.872 --> 41:19.956
Reminds me of my honeymoon!

41:19.996 --> 41:21.736
LAUGHTER

41:21.776 --> 41:24.000
Helmet suits you, got to say.

41:24.040 --> 41:25.452
I'm not going to talk about
the honeymoon, that's why.

41:25.492 --> 41:27.220
Right, first corner.

41:27.260 --> 41:31.172
That's a tighter line there than
Simon's and using all the road.

41:31.212 --> 41:33.548
When it squeals, ease it off.

41:33.588 --> 41:36.112
Just like a bag of pigs.

41:36.152 --> 41:37.328
LAUGHTER

41:37.368 --> 41:39.628
'I was trying to channel you.'

41:39.668 --> 41:42.860
'I'm not even going to go anywhere
with these remarks in the car.

41:42.900 --> 41:45.064
'A bag of pigs.

41:45.104 --> 41:47.812
'Less aggressive on the
brakes than Simon was there.

41:47.852 --> 41:52.800
'Now, let's have a look.
Does this look tidy?'

41:52.840 --> 41:53.968
'Ooh, little chirrup. Slow.

41:54.008 --> 41:56.888
'Looks slow. Could be fast, though.
- You never know.

41:56.928 --> 41:58.924
'And on to the straight.'

41:58.964 --> 42:00.676
You waved!

42:00.716 --> 42:04.036
Why do I keep looking in the mirror?

42:04.076 --> 42:06.344
Why did I keep looking in
the mirror? I don't know.

42:06.384 --> 42:09.520
It's natural. It's in everybody
they must check the mirror.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.608
Swing it to the right.

42:11.648 --> 42:13.532
Past the wall of tyres.

42:13.572 --> 42:16.936
No, left! Left, left!
It's left on the wall!

42:16.976 --> 42:20.048
I went out right... Oh,
I see, to come in again.

42:20.088 --> 42:22.752
My willy feels funny. LAUGHTER

42:22.792 --> 42:27.376
That's a James May problem. He's always
saying he has this fizzing penis root.

42:27.416 --> 42:29.688
Right, there we... Ooh,
so where are we going?

42:29.728 --> 42:32.424
Whoa! Tom Cruise line! There we are,

42:32.464 --> 42:35.328
we've crossed the line. APPLAUSE

42:35.368 --> 42:38.564
That's two wheels!

42:38.604 --> 42:42.408
That's dangerous, with me being on
the right, too. That could have...

42:42.448 --> 42:44.564
Now that is... There's
Michael Gambon, Tom Cruise

42:44.604 --> 42:48.036
and you have had it on two
wheels in that last corner. Good.

42:48.076 --> 42:53.328
Awesome. But was it enough?
That is the question.

42:53.368 --> 42:56.204
I can feel my heart in my ears.

42:56.244 --> 42:57.296
LAUGHTER

42:57.336 --> 42:59.676
Right. Simon. Yes?

42:59.716 --> 43:01.580
You're first in the list, OK?

43:01.620 --> 43:07.392
When you were last here, you did it in 1:48.05,
which actually is a very quick time, in that old...

43:07.432 --> 43:10.408
It was a Lacetti,
wasn't it? It was, yeah.

43:10.448 --> 43:13.736
So where do you think you've come this time? 1:48.05
- where do you think you are now?

43:13.776 --> 43:15.360
I honestly couldn't tell you.

43:15.400 --> 43:18.984
Well, you did it in 1...

43:19.024 --> 43:21.640
40...

43:21.680 --> 43:23.676
4... Ooh! Wow.

43:23.716 --> 43:25.924
..9! Wow! You...

43:25.964 --> 43:27.676
APPLAUSE

43:27.716 --> 43:35.080
..are there.

43:35.120 --> 43:41.080
You'll be able to tell Tom Cruise you're right on
top of Cameron Diaz... This isn't working, is it?

43:41.120 --> 43:44.640
I think it's working fine. Between
Cameron and Tom. That's great.

43:44.680 --> 43:48.016
You are between Cameron and Tom.
Now, Nick, obviously the heavyweight.

43:48.056 --> 43:50.128
Yeah. Are you going to put HW on mine?

43:50.168 --> 43:52.656
LAUGHTER FF.

43:52.696 --> 43:56.768
Ah! Aw!

43:56.808 --> 44:00.016
He nearly killed a journalist in Birmingham
once for making a joke about his weight.

44:00.056 --> 44:02.608
I did. Did you? I grabbed
him round his throat.

44:02.648 --> 44:07.160
Really? Yeah. That's what
the new Ferrari's called.

44:07.200 --> 44:09.752
I was talking about Ferrari.

44:09.792 --> 44:11.440
I feel like Chewbacca now.

44:11.480 --> 44:15.296
"Let the wookiee win." HE GRUNTS

44:15.336 --> 44:20.472
Where do you reckon you've come
on that? I don't know. 1:49, maybe.

44:20.512 --> 44:24.188
Well, you did it in 1...

44:24.228 --> 44:26.720
40...

44:26.760 --> 44:30.064
4...

44:30.104 --> 44:32.376
Oh! ..point 5.

44:32.416 --> 44:40.064
Oh! So that puts you third...

44:40.104 --> 44:41.376
We did really well.

44:41.416 --> 44:43.688
Well done.

44:43.728 --> 44:45.924
Thank you, Jeremy.

44:45.964 --> 44:50.676
Are you surprised by this? Imagine if I
weighed 11 stone. I'd get round in 1:08!

44:50.716 --> 44:54.732
That is a remarkable performance. Have
you done track? You've been here before.

44:54.772 --> 44:57.140
I've never done it. You've
never driven on a track?

44:57.180 --> 45:00.172
I bought you a track day,
you never went. I never went.

45:00.212 --> 45:02.860
You should try and take it up
because there's a natural talent.

45:02.900 --> 45:05.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
Simon Pegg, Nick Frost.

45:05.040 --> 45:08.688
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

45:08.728 --> 45:10.720
Thank you very much.

45:10.760 --> 45:15.064
Well done, man. I know. Brilliant.

45:15.104 --> 45:18.296
Right, moving on.

45:18.336 --> 45:20.216
Tonight...

45:20.256 --> 45:23.844
Tonight we are engaged in a
challenge that was supposed to be

45:23.884 --> 45:28.124
to find the best four-seater convertible
you can buy for less than £2,000.

45:28.164 --> 45:31.812
Yeah. Sadly, though,
we all bought BMW 325i.

45:31.852 --> 45:33.844
So instead we're
finding out how different

45:33.884 --> 45:38.064
three supposedly identical
cars have become over the years.

45:38.104 --> 45:43.908
Yeah. So far we've discovered that his car
is full of mucus and mine full of poo...

45:43.948 --> 45:46.968
And pubic hair. Yeah. Andspent
most of the time broken down.

45:47.008 --> 45:54.564
But as we rejoin the action,all
three cars are actually working.

45:54.604 --> 45:56.688
What you're looking at here is the Stig

45:56.728 --> 46:02.732
setting a lap time in the
modern-day equivalent of our cars.

46:02.772 --> 46:05.908
A time we shall try to match.

46:05.948 --> 46:10.968
I'm, in some ways, confident. I have the paving
slab in the boot giving me better handling,

46:11.008 --> 46:17.344
and yet not confident at
all because I have no brakes.

46:17.384 --> 46:22.608
I wonder if my brakes are any good.
You don't know, do you? Not really, no.

46:22.648 --> 46:26.236
Oooh, stand back!

46:26.276 --> 46:29.968
1:35.09.

46:30.008 --> 46:36.016
Right, now we just have to see which
one of us gets closest to that time.

46:36.056 --> 46:40.800
Here we go.

46:40.840 --> 46:44.092
Wipers not working.

46:44.132 --> 46:48.108
OK, this, little BMW,is when
you win back your stripes.

46:48.148 --> 46:50.124
It's been lowered.

46:50.164 --> 46:53.080
I think you'll findit'll
suddenly emerge as the star.

46:53.120 --> 46:56.624
TYRES SCREECH

46:56.664 --> 47:01.452
Get out of the way, you
incompetent, long-haired old spaniel.

47:01.492 --> 47:05.248
I think this is Chicago.

47:05.288 --> 47:07.360
Come on, paving stone, do your work.

47:07.400 --> 47:09.140
TYRES SCREECH

47:09.180 --> 47:11.656
Holy moley!

47:11.696 --> 47:17.032
These old 325is, they had
semi-trailing on rear suspension.

47:17.072 --> 47:21.936
They were known as the third biggest killer
of yuppies because of the tail-happiness,

47:21.976 --> 47:26.808
after Porsche 911 and
accidents involving races.

47:26.848 --> 47:31.424
Here's the non-braking Jeremy Clarkson.

47:31.464 --> 47:36.936
I'll go get Hammond.

47:36.976 --> 47:42.548
Ooh. I think I'm wasting quitea
lot of time being sideways here.

47:42.588 --> 47:48.516
'Hammond was very easy to catch because whoever
had lowered his car hadn't done a very good job.'

47:48.556 --> 47:50.764
He's got a wobble.

47:50.804 --> 47:53.720
Whoa!

47:53.760 --> 47:58.516
My car obviously isn't the fastest
here, but it seems to be the most stable.

47:58.556 --> 48:06.080
TYRES SCREECH

48:06.120 --> 48:07.092
'In truth,

48:07.132 --> 48:11.516
'all of our ultimate driving
machines had lost their edge.'

48:11.556 --> 48:13.344
Oh, dear.

48:13.384 --> 48:15.800
'But Hammond's was in
a class of its own.'

48:15.840 --> 48:18.904
Oh-ho!

48:18.944 --> 48:22.392
He's gone. He's so gone now.

48:22.432 --> 48:28.780
Ha-ha-ha!

48:28.820 --> 48:31.528
There's a simple rule when you're buying
a car, demonstrated by Hammond here.

48:31.568 --> 48:39.984
If it's been modified, especially
if it's been lowered, walk away.

48:40.024 --> 48:45.800
I'm beginning to think Jeremy's rather
crude handling pack might be the answer.

48:45.840 --> 48:50.392
'With one lap to go, we all
decided to really go for it.'

48:50.432 --> 48:57.652
No, no, no. Don't do that. Damn.

48:57.692 --> 49:00.528
My seat's collapsed, badly.

49:00.568 --> 49:08.000
'Still, could be worse.'

49:08.040 --> 49:12.124
ENGINE WHINES

49:12.164 --> 49:14.372
Yeah!

49:14.412 --> 49:16.140
Right.

49:16.180 --> 49:18.544
Well, I hope I got a quick time in.

49:18.584 --> 49:22.000
We'd find out soon enough
because the results were in.

49:22.040 --> 49:27.280
Here we are, these are the times.Remember,
the Stig did it in 1:35. Yeah.

49:27.320 --> 49:31.344
James
- 1:55.04.

49:31.384 --> 49:34.984
Me
- 1:55.03 is my best.

49:35.024 --> 49:36.952
And, Jeremy, your best,

49:36.992 --> 49:40.528
1:48.0
- which means you win.

49:40.568 --> 49:43.372
It's a hollow victory.
Where's your car? Over there.

49:43.412 --> 49:46.888
It's quite broken. What's
wrong with it? Well...

49:46.928 --> 49:51.688
the rear hose let go, sprayed water over
the electrics, which shorted them out.

49:51.728 --> 49:54.968
The exhaust manifold is cracked

49:55.008 --> 49:58.688
and the head's cooked. You've killed it.

49:58.728 --> 50:03.440
Luckily for Jeremy, our next
experiment didn't involve any movement.

50:03.480 --> 50:08.968
Over time, the roof on a convertible
- will get baggy and start to leak.

50:09.008 --> 50:10.904
To see which of our cars leaks the most,

50:10.944 --> 50:16.108
we've devised an ingenious test.

50:16.148 --> 50:21.888
James is sitting in his car holding his
breath, because his car is full of gas.

50:21.928 --> 50:26.608
Now if the car leaks, the gas will escape, and
when he needs to take a breath, he'll be fine.

50:26.648 --> 50:32.080
If it doesn't leak, the gas won't escape and when
he needs to take a breath, he'll be in trouble.

50:32.120 --> 50:33.672
So is it cyanide we're using?

50:33.712 --> 50:35.280
No, helium. Helium?

50:35.320 --> 50:37.032
Yeah. Pure helium? Yes.

50:37.072 --> 50:38.468
That'll kill him. Yes.

50:38.508 --> 50:40.404
JAMES EXHALES Here we go.

50:40.444 --> 50:43.032
He's breathing. That's it, come on.

50:43.072 --> 50:46.156
HIGH-PITCHED: Whose idea was
this test? Bloody stupid idea.

50:46.196 --> 50:48.468
OTHERS LAUGH It's a very good idea.

50:48.508 --> 50:50.732
We've learned about your car.

50:50.772 --> 50:55.328
You sound like Donald Duck
because your car has done well.

50:55.368 --> 50:59.544
Given the contents of his car, Hammond
quite enjoyed holding his breath.

50:59.584 --> 51:04.280
HE EXHALES

51:04.320 --> 51:08.936
NORMAL PITCH:Ah, you see
mine's had a new... Oh!

51:08.976 --> 51:10.000
OTHERS LAUGH

51:10.040 --> 51:12.448
Not a new roof fitted very well.

51:12.488 --> 51:18.780
You thought you'd have a squeaky voice! I was
expecting a full Smurf and it's not worked.

51:18.820 --> 51:23.000
Finally it was Jeremy's turn.

51:23.040 --> 51:26.312
He's going to have to
breathe. He's done it. Right.

51:26.352 --> 51:28.652
HIGH-PITCHED: I just
have to say that's stupid.

51:28.692 --> 51:32.468
It's just a test of
how big your lungs are.

51:32.508 --> 51:34.528
After this we got Jeremy's car going

51:34.568 --> 51:39.496
and went to see a group
of BMW specialists.

51:39.536 --> 51:41.248
Their job was to calculate the cost

51:41.288 --> 51:49.764
of returning each of our
cars to showroom condition.

51:49.804 --> 51:53.404
These cars come from a time when
people fitted after-market stereos.

51:53.444 --> 51:55.420
Let me talk you through this one.

51:55.460 --> 51:57.404
Here's the radio.

51:57.444 --> 52:00.404
STATIC That's Radio 1, Radio 2,

52:00.444 --> 52:03.920
Radio 3, Radio 4... STATIC CONTINUES

52:03.960 --> 52:06.328
..Radio 5.

52:06.368 --> 52:09.932
STATIC CONTINUES

52:09.972 --> 52:11.840
Don't know what that is.

52:11.880 --> 52:15.840
Eventually the experts had
finished their assessments.

52:15.880 --> 52:19.796
Who has the results for Richard
Hammond's sewage farm? I do.

52:19.836 --> 52:21.560
£7,500.

52:21.600 --> 52:24.808
7,500 to put that into
showroom condition?

52:24.848 --> 52:28.000
Sir, you have the
results for James' car.

52:28.040 --> 52:32.216
Around 5,500. So
£2,000 less. Well done.

52:32.256 --> 52:34.088
Did you just say well done? I did.

52:34.128 --> 52:37.280
You're a girl. How much would
mine cost to put into show?

52:37.320 --> 52:39.248
Well, how many pence?

52:39.288 --> 52:42.216
HE CLEARS THROAT Er...11,000.

52:42.256 --> 52:44.340
That's pounds, not pence. OTHERS LAUGH

52:44.380 --> 52:47.156
What a pile of junk! Why is it £11,000?

52:47.196 --> 52:49.748
What possible reason is there for that?

52:49.788 --> 52:52.528
Oh. Oh, there's a few reasons.

52:52.568 --> 52:56.388
Oh, it's blown away.

52:56.428 --> 53:00.448
Since none of our cars were really
roadworthy, we decided at this point

53:00.488 --> 53:07.312
that the best thing we could do with
them was form a stunt driving team.

53:07.352 --> 53:15.776
We began by watching the experts.

53:15.816 --> 53:22.904
How do they memorise the moves?

53:22.944 --> 53:25.436
That was a J-turn.

53:25.476 --> 53:33.776
I can do all the moves
individually, I think.

53:33.816 --> 53:37.060
'It all looked terribly complicated
- and that was a worry,

53:37.100 --> 53:45.872
'because the next day, we would be
performing in front of a live audience.'

53:45.912 --> 53:51.248
Wow. That's quite good.

53:51.288 --> 53:52.624
We're going to need to work on that.

53:52.664 --> 53:56.108
'We began by planning our
moves on a blackboard.'

53:56.148 --> 53:58.120
That's the nose of the car
that pointing that way. That's

53:58.160 --> 54:05.088
Over here, right, that's Jeremy.

54:05.128 --> 54:10.012
Then here...

54:10.052 --> 54:13.436
Those cars both have J on. They
both have J. So it could be... Oh.

54:13.476 --> 54:15.592
'James took over.'

54:15.632 --> 54:19.368
We have a numbering system, so
you go first. I cross behind you...

54:19.408 --> 54:22.340
Everything goes through that point,
- the point of the performance...

54:22.380 --> 54:25.968
'But his plans were a bit confusing.'

54:26.008 --> 54:27.904
Sorry, I'm lost.

54:27.944 --> 54:29.980
Which is my dotted line now?

54:30.020 --> 54:34.592
That one. No, you were this
one. Yeah, it is that one.

54:34.632 --> 54:37.776
'Nevertheless, we wet the
track to make it more slippery

54:37.816 --> 54:39.496
'and got to work.'

54:39.536 --> 54:45.000
Right, here we go.

54:45.040 --> 54:48.932
'Initially, things didn't go well.'

54:48.972 --> 54:53.280
This is just a lot of driving about.

54:53.320 --> 54:57.652
Why have you gone over there? Sorry.

54:57.692 --> 55:01.652
'Then, thanks to my awful
brakes, they got worse.'

55:01.692 --> 55:04.028
I'm not stopping, I'm not stopping!
- MUFFLED THUMP

55:04.068 --> 55:07.056
Oh, damn it.

55:07.096 --> 55:10.280
'Despite everything, though, the
next day we were ready to perform

55:10.320 --> 55:17.212
'at one of the most prestigious
venues in the country...'

55:17.252 --> 55:18.652
In the wild, birds of prey...

55:18.692 --> 55:23.608
'..The Essex County Fair.

55:23.648 --> 55:26.000
'Our cars had been given
a new lick of paint,

55:26.040 --> 55:27.980
'and as zero hour approached,

55:28.020 --> 55:31.624
'we were in our motor
home rehearsing our moves.'

55:31.664 --> 55:33.904
Go. Right, so...

55:33.944 --> 55:35.904
Turn, Turn, through. And I'm here.

55:35.944 --> 55:38.324
Handbrake. Back forwards.

55:38.364 --> 55:41.932
Face the other way by then. Through
- the gap. Round you. Handbrake.

55:41.972 --> 55:44.560
OK, ready? And then
now... Cross, I go first.

55:44.600 --> 55:47.652
Over there.

55:47.692 --> 55:53.572
It's going to be magnificent.
Right, let's do it.

55:53.612 --> 56:00.728
We're a bit like the Red Arrows. Pretty
much. It's quite an exciting moment.

56:00.768 --> 56:06.808
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing from TV's Top
Gear, The Dukes Of Harlow stunt driving team.

56:06.848 --> 56:10.264
'The capacity crowd was beside itself.

56:10.304 --> 56:14.340
'As the music signalled the start of
our routine, we entered the arena.'

56:14.380 --> 56:17.840
MUSIC: "Don't Stop Me Now"by Queen

56:17.880 --> 56:24.652
We'd better deliver. Suddenly feel
this is quite a responsibility.

56:24.692 --> 56:26.592
Right, left, down...

56:26.632 --> 56:29.620
left, straight up.

56:29.660 --> 56:34.648
Must remember that crossover.

56:34.688 --> 56:40.056
Ready, steady, go.

56:40.096 --> 56:43.480
And turn, turn.

56:43.520 --> 56:52.044
Oh!

56:52.084 --> 56:55.356
Now, it is a shame we can't
show you the rest of that film,

56:55.396 --> 56:59.324
but we lost the tapes. Yes!
Can you believe it? LAUGHTER

56:59.364 --> 57:04.728
You left them on a bus. And then the dog ate
them. Yeah. Dog ate them. It is a rotten...

57:04.768 --> 57:08.368
It is a massive shame, because
therest of our routine was brilliant.

57:08.408 --> 57:12.232
It's just a tragedy you
can't see it. I do apologise.

57:12.272 --> 57:17.008
It does at least give us time to knock up a
scoreboard and see who bought the best car.

57:17.048 --> 57:21.932
Yes. In the nought to 100
and then nought again test,

57:21.972 --> 57:24.168
James set the benchmark,
so he gets zero.

57:24.208 --> 57:28.668
I got minus 281 and,
Hammond, you got minus 1,000.

57:28.708 --> 57:33.000
I didn't even take part.
That's why you get minus 1,000.

57:33.040 --> 57:37.168
Now, forensics, you get ten points off for every
disgusting thing that was found in your car.

57:37.208 --> 57:42.120
Mine was crisps, leaves and bits of
- my own skin, so that's not really disgusting at all, so nought.

57:42.160 --> 57:46.684
James, you were mucus, scabs and saliva.

57:46.724 --> 57:49.168
You're minus 30.

57:49.208 --> 57:53.008
Hammond, you, let's get this
straight, you were saliva, blood...

57:53.048 --> 57:55.716
But there was no mucus in mine!
mucus, but there was pubic hair...

57:55.756 --> 57:58.464
Yeah, yeah. ..so minus 30 and then poo.

57:58.504 --> 58:00.480
Yeah. That's 1,000...

58:00.520 --> 58:05.696
Why do I get minus 1,000 for poo?
Because poo's really disgusting!

58:05.736 --> 58:08.076
Of course you're going to
get minus 1,000 for that.

58:08.116 --> 58:12.436
We don't make the rules. The thief
test. Jeremy... JEREMY MOUTHS: We do!

58:12.476 --> 58:15.716
Your car wasn't stolen
so you get nought. Yeah.

58:15.756 --> 58:18.544
My car wasn't, so I get nought.

58:18.584 --> 58:23.528
Hammond, your car was stolen.
Yes? And you get minus 1,000.

58:23.568 --> 58:25.448
Do I?LAUGHTER

58:25.488 --> 58:29.308
How do you get to that? It just is,
it's scientific, this. Lap times.

58:29.348 --> 58:30.872
You didn't get minus 1,000 for that.

58:30.912 --> 58:33.480
They're there. The gas test.

58:33.520 --> 58:37.544
Let's get this straight. No gas
escaped from my car so I get nought.

58:37.584 --> 58:41.008
No gas escaped from your
car, James, so that's nought.

58:41.048 --> 58:43.852
All of the gas escaped from
yours so that's minus...

58:43.892 --> 58:48.448
Let me guess. Yes, you're
right, it's minus 1,000. Is it?

58:48.488 --> 58:52.288
Is it really? Yes, it is. The
restoration test, here you lose a point

58:52.328 --> 58:55.776
for every pound it would take to get
your car back to showroom condition.

58:55.816 --> 58:58.964
Now, I, as you would
expect, did best at this,

58:59.004 --> 59:03.028
so I'm minus 5,500 points.

59:03.068 --> 59:05.280
It's like being on QI, this.

59:05.320 --> 59:10.368
Hammond, you are minus 7,500 points.

59:10.408 --> 59:12.336
And Jeremy Clarkson... Mmm-hmm.

59:12.376 --> 59:17.260
..you are minus 11,000.

59:17.300 --> 59:19.728
Ah! I might beat... Well,
not him but you, anyway.

59:19.768 --> 59:22.900
What have you got, James? I've
won, obviously. That's a given.

59:22.940 --> 59:24.620
You are...

59:24.660 --> 59:32.684
minus 11,293.1.

59:32.724 --> 59:36.400
Minus 11,293.1. Yes.

59:36.440 --> 59:39.528
So, Hammond, this is
tense. Minus 11,000...

59:39.568 --> 59:42.184
Still hope, though. I
can still do it. Oooh!

59:42.224 --> 59:43.492
549... Yes!

59:43.532 --> 59:47.308
APPLAUSE

59:47.348 --> 59:48.604
I mean, well done, James.

59:48.644 --> 59:52.852
But, really, two conclusions
we can draw from this.

59:52.892 --> 59:57.728
One, all identical cars
aren't necessarily identical.

59:57.768 --> 01:00:01.088
Some of them do have pubic
hairs in them and poo.

01:00:01.128 --> 01:00:05.900
And two, Richard Hammond, who buys
more used cars than any man alive,

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:09.024
is useless at buying used cars.

01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:11.228
I am. On that bombshell,
it's time to end.
