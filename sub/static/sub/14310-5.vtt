[theme music]

00:07.089 --> 00:10.099
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:10.119 --> 00:14.089
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:14.109 --> 00:16.230
They call themselves Smurfs.

00:17.010 --> 00:18.230
They were good.

00:19.010 --> 00:21.230
[theme music]

00:24.079 --> 00:28.079
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:28.100 --> 00:29.219
He was bad.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.049
Oh, I hate Smurfs.

00:33.140 --> 00:36.020
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:36.039 --> 00:38.090
if it's the last thing
I ever do!

00:38.109 --> 00:40.140
[evil laughter]

00:40.159 --> 00:41.149
Unh!

00:41.170 --> 00:43.109
Oh, I'll get you.

00:43.130 --> 00:46.159
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry.

00:46.179 --> 00:49.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there

00:49.049 --> 00:53.070
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:53.090 --> 00:56.020
And if you are good,
you may just catch

00:56.039 --> 00:58.210
a glimpse of the Smurfs.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.200
[theme music]

01:11.019 --> 01:13.120
Help, help!
Run for your smurf!

01:13.140 --> 01:14.210
[snarling]

01:16.049 --> 01:19.030
Whoa! Hurry, Brainy.
He's catching up.

01:19.049 --> 01:22.170
Don't worry, Clumsy.
He won't dare cross this log.

01:22.189 --> 01:26.060
Cats hate to get wet.

01:27.099 --> 01:28.200
[snarls]

01:28.219 --> 01:29.230
[grunting]

01:30.010 --> 01:31.150
Yipe!

01:31.170 --> 01:33.060
[grunting]

01:35.140 --> 01:37.020
Whoa!

01:39.129 --> 01:41.030
[both coughing]

01:44.039 --> 01:47.000
Boy, that was close,
huh, Brainy?

01:47.020 --> 01:50.159
Oh, fiddlesmurfs. I knew
what I was doing every second.

01:50.180 --> 01:53.039
Uh, hey, Brainy, what's that?

01:53.060 --> 01:56.200
Certainly I..
Bottle? Strange.

01:58.079 --> 02:01.099
Uh, what's it say?
What's it say?

02:05.200 --> 02:07.180
Wow, a genie.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.139
And, and I found him.

02:10.158 --> 02:12.159
You found me?

02:12.180 --> 02:15.210
Well, actually he's more
to blame in cause.

02:15.229 --> 02:21.009
Ha! It is I, Genie Meanie,
who found you, fool.

02:21.030 --> 02:24.009
Every 100 years I come out
of this bottle

02:24.030 --> 02:26.030
'and grant three wishes.'

02:26.050 --> 02:27.150
- Three wishes.
- Three wishes.

02:27.170 --> 02:31.150
But first you must guess
the magic words.

02:31.170 --> 02:35.210
Uh, gee, Brainy, I don't know
any magic words. Do you?

02:35.229 --> 02:37.110
Certainly.

02:37.129 --> 02:39.020
Um, mm..

02:39.039 --> 02:40.210
Razzle dazzle.

02:40.229 --> 02:42.079
[yawning]

02:42.099 --> 02:46.030
- Uh, randy dandy?
- 'No.'

02:46.050 --> 02:49.050
- Uh, frizzle dizzle?
- No, no, no.

02:49.069 --> 02:51.039
And your time's running out.

02:51.060 --> 02:55.219
At sundown, I return to the
bottle for another 100 years.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.069
'Wishes or no wishes.'

02:58.090 --> 03:01.080
Uh, gee, what a meanie genie.

03:01.099 --> 03:05.060
If he is a genie. I'm starting
to think he's a big fake.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.009
(Genie)
A fake?

03:07.030 --> 03:08.110
[snaps finger]

03:10.020 --> 03:11.060
[Clumsy screams]

03:11.080 --> 03:12.139
Help!

03:12.159 --> 03:14.199
Genie Meanie, let us down.

03:14.219 --> 03:17.110
Down? Why, of course.
[snaps fingers]

03:18.210 --> 03:20.030
[splat]

03:22.219 --> 03:25.139
[both coughing]

03:25.159 --> 03:28.020
Now, I'm a busy genie.

03:28.039 --> 03:30.189
So if you can't think of
the magic words

03:30.210 --> 03:34.009
'then take me to someone
who can. Now.'

03:36.110 --> 03:38.170
[squeaking]

03:38.189 --> 03:41.199
Tiptoe.
I can't hear the birds.

03:41.219 --> 03:43.110
Yes, sir, Mr. Genie.

03:43.129 --> 03:47.120
There, Azrael. My new Smurf
projector is finished.

03:47.139 --> 03:49.219
Now to test it out.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.210
[machine whirring]

03:52.229 --> 03:54.050
It's working.

03:54.069 --> 03:55.120
[Azrael meows]

03:55.139 --> 03:57.189
Look, Azrael. Smurfs.

03:57.210 --> 04:01.189
[stammers]
And what's this? A genie.

04:01.210 --> 04:05.129
I sure hope Papa Smurf can guess
Genie Meanie's magic word.

04:05.150 --> 04:08.129
Yeah, then we can smurf
three wishes

04:08.150 --> 04:11.180
and they'll all come true.

04:11.199 --> 04:13.099
Wishes that come true?

04:13.120 --> 04:16.199
Oh, scorpion stings.
Don't stop now.

04:16.220 --> 04:19.009
[boom]

04:19.029 --> 04:22.170
Drat. Azrael,
I must have that Genie Meanie.

04:22.189 --> 04:25.139
Then I'll show those
disgusting little Smurfs

04:25.160 --> 04:27.230
the real meaning of "Meanie."

04:28.009 --> 04:29.170
[laughs]

04:29.189 --> 04:31.129
[laughs]

04:34.069 --> 04:36.199
- What's that?
- It's Genie Meanie.

04:39.019 --> 04:41.000
Whoa, a real genie.

04:41.019 --> 04:43.159
I hate genies.

04:43.180 --> 04:46.230
Well, uh, on second thought,
not all genies.

04:47.009 --> 04:48.110
[gulps, then chuckles]

04:48.129 --> 04:50.110
Quickly, where's Papa Smurf?

04:50.129 --> 04:52.090
Gone to dig for rare roots.

04:52.110 --> 04:55.090
- He'll be back later.
- Too bad, Smurfs.

04:55.110 --> 04:59.009
No magic words,
no three wishes.

04:59.029 --> 05:01.079
(all)
No three wishes?

05:01.100 --> 05:03.149
Uh, no need to get upset,
Mr. Genie.

05:03.170 --> 05:06.170
Here's a cake
I just baked for myself.

05:06.189 --> 05:08.060
How nice.

05:08.079 --> 05:11.160
And to show you
what a good sport I am

05:11.180 --> 05:14.060
I'm going to share it with you.

05:14.079 --> 05:15.189
[snaps fingers]

05:15.209 --> 05:17.230
[Genie laughing]

05:18.009 --> 05:21.199
Uh, a great sense of humor
you have there, Mr. Genie.

05:21.220 --> 05:25.040
- I thought it was mean.
- Relax, blondie.

05:25.060 --> 05:27.180
There's plenty for everyone.

05:27.199 --> 05:29.029
[snaps finger]

05:32.050 --> 05:35.019
[laughing]

05:37.040 --> 05:40.029
Alright, that did it,
you meanie genie.

05:40.050 --> 05:42.100
Put up your dukes
and fight like a Smurf.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.100
[chuckling]

05:44.120 --> 05:46.050
[snapping fingers]

05:46.069 --> 05:48.029
Hey. What the..

05:48.050 --> 05:49.040
[bam]

05:49.060 --> 05:50.050
[splash]

05:50.069 --> 05:52.159
[Genie laughing]

05:52.180 --> 05:55.069
Boy, I pack a mean punch.

05:57.209 --> 06:00.129
No. No, wrong. No. No.

06:00.149 --> 06:02.120
Magic words, magic words.

06:02.139 --> 06:05.050
No, not that.
No, no. Ah-ha!

06:05.069 --> 06:07.100
Great-grandfather's
book of genies.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.230
The magic words are
bound to be in here.

06:10.009 --> 06:11.139
[groans]

06:11.160 --> 06:13.199
There, Genie Meanie

06:13.220 --> 06:17.100
"Obeys the magic words
pumpernickel pickle."

06:17.120 --> 06:18.220
[laughs]

06:19.000 --> 06:21.050
- Say your prayers, Smurfs.
- Reow!

06:21.069 --> 06:25.000
Your Genie Meanie
is about to have a new master.

06:25.019 --> 06:27.110
[laughs]

06:27.129 --> 06:32.050
You Smurfs may not be good
for much, but you're sure good..

06:32.069 --> 06:34.199
[snaps fingers]

06:36.100 --> 06:37.170
'...for a laugh.'

06:37.189 --> 06:39.159
[Genie laughing]

06:41.199 --> 06:44.090
That does it,
you mean old meanie.

06:44.110 --> 06:46.209
Wishes or no wishes,
get out of our village.

06:46.230 --> 06:51.069
- Yeah, before we throw you out.
- No, wait, they're kidding.

06:51.090 --> 06:53.199
[chuckles]
Uh, they don't really mean--

06:53.220 --> 06:57.029
Nobody throws me out.

06:57.050 --> 07:01.079
Oh, yeah?
Okay, Smurfs, charge!

07:01.100 --> 07:04.029
[all yelling]

07:04.050 --> 07:05.060
[snaps fingers]

07:05.079 --> 07:07.209
[clamoring]

07:14.000 --> 07:14.209
[splash]

07:14.230 --> 07:16.129
What's smurfing on here?

07:16.149 --> 07:18.199
Oh, Papa Smurf, it's a genie.

07:18.220 --> 07:21.160
Genie Meanie. And he kicked
us out of the village.

07:21.180 --> 07:25.019
Genie, eh? I've dealt
with genies before.

07:26.189 --> 07:28.029
You there. Genie.

07:28.050 --> 07:30.180
Stop smurfing around
and behave yourself.

07:30.199 --> 07:33.139
Or we will wish you
out of our village.

07:33.159 --> 07:37.199
How, pops?
Do you know the magic words?

07:37.220 --> 07:39.009
Magic words?

07:39.029 --> 07:42.029
How about some food
for thought?

07:44.120 --> 07:46.050
[all gasp]

07:46.069 --> 07:49.100
Genie Meanie,
you fix that at once.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.069
Sure. There.

07:53.069 --> 07:55.129
Now everything matches.

07:55.149 --> 07:57.139
[Genie laughing]

08:00.149 --> 08:03.009
(Gargamel)
'Pumpernickel pickle'

08:03.029 --> 08:05.160
Genie Meanie, can you hear me?

08:05.180 --> 08:09.129
Pumpernickel pickle.
Pumpernickel pickle.

08:09.149 --> 08:11.129
I-I don't believe it.

08:11.149 --> 08:15.050
Someone just said
the magic word.

08:15.069 --> 08:17.120
Pumpernickel pick--

08:17.139 --> 08:18.170
[mews]

08:18.189 --> 08:21.069
Azrael, ha-ha-ha, we did it!

08:21.089 --> 08:22.220
Beginner's luck.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.139
But in ten minutes
the sun sets

08:25.160 --> 08:28.060
and I go back in the bottle.

08:28.079 --> 08:29.209
Well, then let's get started.

08:29.230 --> 08:34.120
Genie Meanie, we wish to go
straight to the Smurf Village.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.190
Yeah.

08:35.210 --> 08:39.159
Not that boring place again.

08:39.179 --> 08:42.019
[sighs]
Oh, well.

08:42.039 --> 08:43.080
[snaps fingers]

08:44.090 --> 08:46.230
[marching band music]

08:48.159 --> 08:52.100
- Any sign of Gargamel, Hefty?
- Not yet, Smurfette.

08:52.120 --> 08:54.139
(Gargamel)
'Surprise, Smurfs.'

08:54.159 --> 08:57.179
(all)
'Gargamel! Run!'

08:57.200 --> 08:59.100
[Gargamel laughs]

08:59.120 --> 09:03.039
(Gargamel)
No use trying to run.
You'll never get away.

09:03.059 --> 09:06.230
"Magic signs,
magic spells, magic powders

09:07.009 --> 09:08.190
magic potions.."

09:08.210 --> 09:11.110
Papa Smurf,
Gargamel is in the village!

09:11.129 --> 09:14.159
Great smurfs,
where are those magic words?

09:14.179 --> 09:16.210
[snarling]

09:20.179 --> 09:22.009
[yowls]

09:24.129 --> 09:27.019
[upbeat music]

09:30.049 --> 09:33.220
Oh, why you revolting little..

09:34.000 --> 09:35.049
Genie Meanie.

09:35.070 --> 09:36.179
[Genie laughing]

09:38.169 --> 09:40.110
Yes, master?

09:40.129 --> 09:45.029
I wish you to bring those nasty
little Smurfs back at once.

09:45.049 --> 09:48.129
(Genie)
'Your wish is my command.'

09:48.149 --> 09:51.100
(all)
Whoa!

09:51.120 --> 09:52.220
Yipes!

09:54.080 --> 09:56.059
I didn't mean like that.

09:59.039 --> 10:00.070
Ooh!

10:00.090 --> 10:01.120
'Genie Meanie'

10:01.139 --> 10:05.139
'I wish
to have all these Smurfs.'

10:05.159 --> 10:06.230
[snaps fingers]

10:12.039 --> 10:13.090
Aha! Got you.

10:13.110 --> 10:16.190
Papa Smurf,
we're the only two Smurfs left.

10:16.210 --> 10:18.029
[snarls]

10:18.049 --> 10:19.210
Run for your smurf!

10:22.059 --> 10:24.190
Genie, stop those Smurfs!

10:24.210 --> 10:27.230
Not me.
You got your three wishes.

10:28.009 --> 10:30.039
(Gargamel)
'What? I did?'

10:30.059 --> 10:34.149
Genie Meanie, I command you.
I am your master.

10:34.169 --> 10:35.230
[yawns]

10:36.009 --> 10:41.000
"Humongous fungus?" No.
"Flubber blubber?" No.

10:41.019 --> 10:42.149
[Azrael hisses]

10:42.169 --> 10:44.009
Good work, Azrael.

10:44.029 --> 10:47.120
Who needs a broken-down,
old genie anyway?

10:47.139 --> 10:50.009
- "Vanilla gorilla?" No.
- Reow.

10:51.129 --> 10:53.200
"Maroon baboon?" No.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.210
Wait, here it is

10:55.230 --> 10:57.049
"Pumpernickel pickle."

10:57.070 --> 10:59.230
[both gasp]
The magic words.

11:00.009 --> 11:03.000
Quickly, Genie Meanie,
I wish you to shrink

11:03.019 --> 11:06.129
Gargamel and Azrael
down to Smurf size.

11:06.149 --> 11:09.220
Mm. Not bad for a first wish.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.039
[snaps fingers]

11:15.059 --> 11:16.179
[gulps]

11:16.200 --> 11:19.019
Smurf him!

11:19.039 --> 11:21.019
[all clamoring]

11:21.039 --> 11:23.029
(Gargamel)
Help!

11:23.049 --> 11:25.019
[Smurfs yelling]

11:28.039 --> 11:30.000
Papa Smurf,
they're getting away.

11:30.019 --> 11:31.220
Don't worry, we still
have two wishes.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.059
(Genie)
'You'll never make it in time.'

11:34.080 --> 11:37.009
Only 30 seconds to sundown.

11:37.029 --> 11:40.149
Genie Meanie, I order you
to undo all the tricks

11:40.169 --> 11:41.190
you've done today.

11:41.210 --> 11:44.100
Aw, do I have to?

11:44.120 --> 11:47.139
- Genie.
- Yes, master.

11:47.159 --> 11:49.000
[snaps fingers]

12:02.090 --> 12:03.230
- Help!
- Reow!

(Gargamel)
I'll get you Smurfs
for this. You just wait.

12:11.129 --> 12:13.070
[coughing]

12:13.090 --> 12:18.049
Well, it's been fun, Smurfs,
but time's up, so..

12:18.070 --> 12:21.169
Hold it. There are still five
seconds before the sun sets

12:21.190 --> 12:23.059
and we want our last wish.

12:23.080 --> 12:26.149
Ohh, alright, alright.

12:26.169 --> 12:30.100
Genie Meanie, I wish you to stay
in your bottle from now on

12:30.120 --> 12:32.120
until you stop being mean.

12:32.139 --> 12:34.070
Hey, no fair!

12:34.090 --> 12:39.009
I like being mean!

12:44.190 --> 12:48.200
Look, Grouchy,
the evening star.

12:48.220 --> 12:53.009
They say that whoever sees
the evening star gets a wish.

12:53.029 --> 12:55.120
I hate wishes.

12:55.139 --> 12:58.009
(all)
Oh, Grouchy.
