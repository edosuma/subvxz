02:49.161 --> 02:51.497
Dad, it's doing it again.

02:51.581 --> 02:53.833
Oh, come on. I thought I fixed it!

02:53.916 --> 02:56.377
- Who's Alexis?
- That's my assistant.

02:57.169 --> 03:00.214
- Why do you need an assistant?
- She helps me with my work.

03:00.298 --> 03:01.549
I want an assistant.

03:02.133 --> 03:04.051
Finish your cereal first, silly.

03:04.135 --> 03:06.345
Honey, if we're gonna go together,
we need to go.

03:08.806 --> 03:10.182
Honey, come on.

03:11.934 --> 03:14.645
Yeah, I'm just getting dressed.
I'll be down in a second.

03:21.569 --> 03:22.569
Okay.

03:24.029 --> 03:25.239
Oh, wow,

03:25.323 --> 03:27.825
- I haven't seen that shirt in a while.
- Yeah.

03:28.534 --> 03:30.411
How's that breakfast going?

03:33.539 --> 03:34.749
I love talking to a wall.

03:34.832 --> 03:36.876
- Don't take it personally.
- Hmm.

03:37.835 --> 03:40.004
And we talked about
the screen time, remember?

03:40.087 --> 03:42.548
I do, but she already
finished half of her cereal.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.135
- Who's dropping me?
- Both of us.

03:46.218 --> 03:48.113
We've got plans in the city tonight.

03:48.137 --> 03:50.514
Come on, little brontosaurus. All right.

03:54.894 --> 03:57.563
- Okay, here you go, monkey.
- I'm not a monkey.

04:01.359 --> 04:03.069
Come on, slowpokes.

04:07.239 --> 04:09.825
I just can't admit that it's over.

04:11.035 --> 04:13.162
It's like, the minute the
papers were signed...

04:14.997 --> 04:16.916
I fell for her all over again.

04:19.209 --> 04:21.587
Do you think that's about her?

04:22.004 --> 04:24.423
Or just the fact that it's official now?

04:26.467 --> 04:29.136
She calls me unemotional all the time.

04:31.639 --> 04:32.848
Sorry.

04:33.849 --> 04:35.518
No, don't apologize.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.690
These are big decisions
you're making here.

04:44.193 --> 04:47.571
I think you're dealing with it
with such honesty.

04:49.031 --> 04:51.200
It's hard. And commendable.

04:57.081 --> 04:58.666
- I'll see you next week.
- Okay.

05:00.543 --> 05:02.086
Oh, I know we're running a few late.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.463
Just, uh, give me a sec, okay?

05:22.523 --> 05:24.859
<i>Anyway, I always used
to be intimidated by him.</i>

05:24.942 --> 05:25.985
<i>He's that kinda guy.</i>

05:26.527 --> 05:28.127
And we're standing outside the elevator,

05:28.154 --> 05:30.156
and he kind of made a
passive dig about my leave,

05:30.239 --> 05:32.741
and then I just very bluntly
told him to go fuck himself.

05:34.410 --> 05:36.078
Wow, that's bold, Sam.

05:36.454 --> 05:39.373
Yeah, well, finally feels
like things are coming back together.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.542
How so?

05:41.625 --> 05:43.460
Well, like I said, with work.

05:45.630 --> 05:46.797
Anything else?

05:49.050 --> 05:50.343
All right, um...

05:52.511 --> 05:54.305
I'm a little nervous to tell you this.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.556
Don't be nervous.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.391
You can tell me anything, Sam.

06:02.563 --> 06:03.647
I spoke to Sidney.

06:04.648 --> 06:07.443
She'd called me back
after I called her in front of you.

06:07.526 --> 06:09.779
Said we could grab drinks at Morandi.

06:10.613 --> 06:14.074
You know, she was so warm and open,
it was better than I thought.

06:15.284 --> 06:16.369
She asked me about work

06:16.452 --> 06:18.954
and told me
about this demo she's recording.

06:19.830 --> 06:21.790
She looked amazing.

06:23.334 --> 06:27.171
It's like she's so captivating, I can
barely hear the words half the time.

06:27.796 --> 06:29.381
Sorry, I didn't even, um...

06:30.132 --> 06:32.051
I don't know what I'm
trying to say right now.

06:32.134 --> 06:33.636
I have an idea.

06:33.719 --> 06:36.222
Let's just take a moment and...

06:37.056 --> 06:39.684
try an exercise, okay?

06:41.560 --> 06:44.063
It might help you communicate
with more clarity.

06:45.064 --> 06:48.317
So let's just take a breath
and close your eyes.

06:48.818 --> 06:51.570
And try to remember the
feeling in the room.

06:53.239 --> 06:54.991
And pretend I'm Sidney.

07:00.121 --> 07:01.247
What did you say?

07:04.750 --> 07:06.418
Well, I told her that I missed her.

07:06.502 --> 07:08.212
Me. Tell me.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.548
You. Um...

07:14.135 --> 07:15.135
I missed you.

07:17.179 --> 07:18.472
And I...

07:19.473 --> 07:21.642
Well, I think about you all the time.

07:23.936 --> 07:25.187
I bet you do.

07:27.773 --> 07:28.773
It's okay.

07:30.442 --> 07:31.485
Just keep going.

07:41.704 --> 07:43.914
I'm glad you called.

07:44.498 --> 07:47.418
I know I probably shouldn't be,
but I can't help what I feel.

07:48.794 --> 07:50.212
I like that you want me.

07:50.796 --> 07:52.047
She didn't say that.

07:52.131 --> 07:53.131
Oh.

07:56.928 --> 07:58.554
I like hanging with you.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.056
Feels natural.

08:02.141 --> 08:04.477
Not like all the
other bullshit out there.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.395
Now you sound a lot like her.

08:11.025 --> 08:12.276
What else, Sam?

08:14.737 --> 08:18.449
Did you really just come here
to sit and hang out?

08:21.452 --> 08:23.079
Tell me what you really want.

08:26.707 --> 08:27.792
You.

08:34.965 --> 08:38.469
And then Sid came back to my
place, and we slept together.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.308
I know you're not a fan, but it just...

08:45.226 --> 08:46.602
It felt so right.

08:48.104 --> 08:50.481
Like, maybe this is what
was supposed to happen.

08:52.984 --> 08:54.652
And maybe this is a new beginning.

09:00.449 --> 09:02.868
I'm thinking of having a
session at the diner.

09:02.952 --> 09:04.161
With the bulimic?

09:04.245 --> 09:05.913
- She hates to be called that.
- Oh.

09:05.997 --> 09:09.333
Just make sure you allow time
to process back in the office.

09:10.042 --> 09:13.963
And, of course, make sure she
pays for anything she buys.

09:14.964 --> 09:17.592
Sorry, I was under the
impression that it's frowned upon

09:17.675 --> 09:19.635
to spend too much
time outside the office.

09:19.719 --> 09:21.738
<i>- </i> When I was on internship...
- Case by case.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.223
CBT is all about real world exposure.

09:24.306 --> 09:25.682
I'll try it this week.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.518
- See how it goes.
- Jean?

09:29.979 --> 09:31.522
- Jean.
- Hmm? Oh.

09:31.606 --> 09:33.774
I'm sorry, it's just a parent thing.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.152
Where are you with your new intake?

09:37.444 --> 09:38.570
The pill popper?

09:39.113 --> 09:41.741
Uh... Yeah, well, uh, she's doing great.

09:41.824 --> 09:46.829
She's been going to meetings,
been clean for... a few weeks now.

09:47.371 --> 09:50.041
And we're building
a really nice solid rapport.

09:56.547 --> 09:57.590
Hey.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.468
I'm...

10:00.551 --> 10:02.887
having some difficulty
with my pro bono case.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.722
He's young, too, and struggled
a lot with addiction.

10:07.141 --> 10:10.019
I wondered if I could take a look
at your notes on your pill popper.

10:10.853 --> 10:13.147
And see how you've made
so much progress so quickly.

10:13.856 --> 10:14.899
Okay.

10:15.441 --> 10:16.441
Sure.

10:16.692 --> 10:19.987
Yeah, just let me clean 'em up first
before I hand 'em over.

10:20.195 --> 10:22.322
Make sure they're legible.

10:23.198 --> 10:24.867
Cool, thanks, Jean.

11:44.697 --> 11:47.199
<i>I risked and ultimately sacrificed</i>

11:47.283 --> 11:49.452
everything that meant something to me.

11:50.494 --> 11:55.333
And, uh, I'm reminded every day
of how important it is to give thanks.

11:56.542 --> 11:58.878
Take nothing for granted in this world.

11:59.712 --> 12:00.712
'Cause...

12:01.631 --> 12:03.966
Well, the truth is, five years ago...

12:05.384 --> 12:07.803
with the amount of shit
I was puttin' in my body...

12:09.055 --> 12:10.389
I could easily be dead.

12:11.515 --> 12:12.725
And for what?

12:14.435 --> 12:16.724
I gave myself over to what I want...

12:16.736 --> 12:18.189
How are you feeling?

12:18.272 --> 12:19.273
The high.

12:19.774 --> 12:21.442
Like I don't wanna be here.

12:21.525 --> 12:24.904
That's okay, it's completely
normal, but you're here.

12:24.987 --> 12:26.697
And that's courageous.

12:27.656 --> 12:29.658
How do you feel about speaking?

12:30.659 --> 12:33.078
- Here?
- Yeah, it'd be good for you.

12:33.453 --> 12:34.621
You don't have to say much.

12:34.705 --> 12:37.541
I don't want a room full
of strangers knowing my story.

12:39.377 --> 12:42.797
Sometimes those are the only
people we can be honest with.

12:44.840 --> 12:45.967
It'll be a relief.

12:46.384 --> 12:47.927
I realize that now.

12:50.805 --> 12:53.849
Thank you, Randall.
Thank you for sharing.

12:55.726 --> 12:57.895
Is there anyone else
who would like to speak?

13:00.273 --> 13:02.608
Stand up and introduce yourself.

13:02.692 --> 13:04.819
Go on, you can do it.

13:05.402 --> 13:06.402
It's okay.

13:07.571 --> 13:09.489
I won't let go, I promise.

13:11.033 --> 13:12.159
You can do it.

13:25.423 --> 13:26.841
My name is Allison.

13:29.217 --> 13:30.218
And I'm an addict.

13:31.219 --> 13:32.554
Hi, Allison.

13:36.642 --> 13:39.478
I'm gonna suggest
you do what's called 90/90.

13:39.561 --> 13:40.896
90 meetings in 90 days.

13:41.689 --> 13:42.940
90 meetings?

13:43.024 --> 13:45.735
It's not as overwhelming
as it sounds, I promise.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.488
Sorry, I know I still owe you
from the last meetings.

13:49.572 --> 13:52.116
Hey, don't worry about it, okay?

13:52.700 --> 13:54.160
Allison, right?

13:55.243 --> 13:57.537
Oh, we just wanted
to introduce ourselves.

13:58.122 --> 14:00.291
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, and you are?

14:01.751 --> 14:03.336
- Um...
- She's my mom.

14:03.419 --> 14:04.419
Oh.

14:06.963 --> 14:08.048
Okay.

14:09.299 --> 14:12.511
Just call me if you need anything, okay?
I'm proud of you.

14:13.512 --> 14:14.555
Nice to meet you.

14:14.639 --> 14:16.474
So, Allison, welcome.

14:17.642 --> 14:20.061
I wanted to share some information
with you.

14:31.572 --> 14:34.659
- Line actually starts there.
- I was just looking for Sidney.

14:34.951 --> 14:36.035
Is she working today?

14:36.118 --> 14:39.538
No, she took the week off
to record her demo or something.

14:40.206 --> 14:41.332
Oh...

14:41.415 --> 14:42.792
Do you know where?

14:43.167 --> 14:44.835
I, uh... I'm a journalist,

14:44.919 --> 14:48.172
and I'm writing a story
on music in the city,

14:48.255 --> 14:50.090
and I was hoping to speak to her band.

14:50.590 --> 14:51.842
Uh...

14:52.301 --> 14:54.637
I think they usually rehearse
at a space downtown.

14:55.304 --> 14:56.430
Do you know the name?

14:57.556 --> 14:58.473
What about her?

14:58.557 --> 15:00.744
- She won't match with me.
- How do you know?

15:00.768 --> 15:04.021
See, she hasn't even been
on the app in two weeks.

15:04.105 --> 15:06.899
Probably just took a break from her
boyfriend, who's in love with her,

15:06.983 --> 15:10.403
to look at other options
and realized everyone sucks.

15:12.154 --> 15:15.157
Fucking lent Sid all my cash
so she could pay for her demo.

15:15.825 --> 15:17.625
Don't tell me she's using you
for money again.

15:17.702 --> 15:18.702
Shut up.

15:19.453 --> 15:22.123
- She didn't ask, I offered.
- Huh, lemme guess...

15:22.456 --> 15:23.833
She hasn't reached out since.

15:30.505 --> 15:31.923
Oh, shit.

15:33.258 --> 15:36.178
- What?
- Emily. Hold on.

15:40.391 --> 15:41.391
Hey.

15:43.643 --> 15:44.811
Shocked you still come here.

15:45.395 --> 15:47.022
I-I don't really.

15:47.105 --> 15:49.441
Yeah, me neither.
It's Micah's bachelorette.

15:53.612 --> 15:55.655
Well, they all clearly
still hate my guts.

15:55.740 --> 15:56.740
Can you blame them?

15:58.743 --> 15:59.911
So, how... how've you been?

16:00.661 --> 16:02.371
Good. Really good, actually.

16:03.914 --> 16:05.373
- You still with, um...
- No.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.710
Um, I actually
recently broke up with her.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.794
- Oh.
- Yeah.

16:09.879 --> 16:10.879
Sorry to hear that.

16:10.921 --> 16:12.255
No, you're not.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.299
It's true.

16:15.217 --> 16:17.226
Yeah, I think I was
forcing the situation.

16:17.238 --> 16:18.930
It was ultimately really unhealthy.

16:19.013 --> 16:20.139
Yeah.

16:20.222 --> 16:21.432
Yeah, it seemed that way...

16:22.016 --> 16:23.935
to everyone else.

16:25.853 --> 16:27.521
Um, I have to get back to the...

16:28.272 --> 16:29.315
Y-yeah, take care.

16:29.398 --> 16:32.652
Um, tell Micah I said congratulations.

16:33.110 --> 16:34.487
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.446
Hey, uh, Emily?

16:36.529 --> 16:39.574
- I'm really sorry...
- We're not doing this here, Sam.

16:43.246 --> 16:44.580
You're right. My bad.

16:45.163 --> 16:46.289
Have fun.

16:48.833 --> 16:49.833
Oh, my God...

17:02.056 --> 17:03.766
We've been home five minutes.

17:03.849 --> 17:05.476
You couldn't wait to say good night?

17:05.558 --> 17:07.978
I've got an early day tomorrow.

17:09.981 --> 17:10.981
What?

17:12.022 --> 17:13.022
Nothing.

17:15.778 --> 17:18.446
Are you sure that you're okay?
You had...

17:19.240 --> 17:22.952
two patient emergencies over the past...
I don't know, just seems like...

17:23.286 --> 17:24.619
No, I'm fine.

17:26.038 --> 17:27.873
Just had a tough week, that's all.

17:28.207 --> 17:30.293
It's all under control. Don't worry.

17:32.712 --> 17:34.255
Oh, by the way,

17:34.337 --> 17:38.174
I have a continuing psych class
tomorrow night, so...

17:45.641 --> 17:48.269
Okay.
Well, Adrian and a couple of the guys

17:48.351 --> 17:50.520
are gonna come over
and watch the Steelers game, so...

17:50.603 --> 17:51.730
Perfect.

17:57.986 --> 17:59.070
You're not comin' to bed?

17:59.614 --> 18:00.781
I, um...

18:01.532 --> 18:02.950
I just have a little work to do.

18:03.783 --> 18:04.783
I'll come in soon.

19:50.683 --> 19:55.521
<i>♪ Get inside I wanna
get inside your head ♪</i>

19:55.605 --> 19:59.275
<i>♪ I wanna get inside
I wanna get inside... ♪</i>

21:04.382 --> 21:06.401
I gave this to her
when she graduated college.

21:06.425 --> 21:08.261
She told me she'd never take it off.

21:08.843 --> 21:10.595
It's a very thoughtful gift.

21:14.390 --> 21:15.433
Look at this stuff.

21:18.020 --> 21:19.855
Oh, yes, this is the locket.

21:19.938 --> 21:21.689
For her Sweet 16.

21:21.941 --> 21:24.485
- Are you sure it's all Rebecca's?
- Oh, yes.

21:25.778 --> 21:28.823
I was going to buy her
a housewarming present,

21:28.906 --> 21:31.367
not because I wanted
to be clingy or judgmental.

21:31.993 --> 21:33.202
Actually, a good mother.

21:34.245 --> 21:37.039
And, um, I went online and...

21:37.121 --> 21:40.875
tried to find the new address, since,
you know, she wouldn't give it to me.

21:43.129 --> 21:46.382
They directed me to an eBay page, and...

21:47.341 --> 21:48.843
she was selling all of it.

21:50.177 --> 21:51.304
Who does that?

21:52.679 --> 21:55.390
At first, I thought
maybe she needed money, but then...

21:56.976 --> 22:00.354
as time went on, I began to think
maybe she's planning to kill herself.

22:01.105 --> 22:02.105
What?

22:02.523 --> 22:04.442
Wh-why do you say that?

22:05.024 --> 22:06.150
Because when you wanna die,

22:06.234 --> 22:08.794
you give away all your things
because you're not gonna need them.

22:09.864 --> 22:11.365
After all, look at me.

22:11.449 --> 22:13.451
She's already given me away.

22:13.534 --> 22:15.494
Claire...

22:17.079 --> 22:20.291
Trust me, your daughter is not suicidal.

22:22.251 --> 22:23.336
You don't know that.

22:23.918 --> 22:24.918
Yes, I do.

22:25.253 --> 22:26.337
How?

22:27.173 --> 22:28.382
Well, from...

22:28.841 --> 22:30.343
everything you said, she's...

22:31.052 --> 22:34.013
She's not suicidal,
she's just the opposite. She's...

22:34.096 --> 22:36.599
She's trying to find her feet.

22:38.392 --> 22:40.227
You know, they say
when people commit suicide,

22:40.311 --> 22:41.687
they're happy at the end.

22:42.353 --> 22:44.439
- They feel they have the plan...
- Claire.

22:45.483 --> 22:47.902
Your daughter's fine, okay?

22:48.152 --> 22:49.570
Trust me, this is my field.

22:49.654 --> 22:51.530
She is not suicidal.

22:54.325 --> 22:56.786
I just keep thinking,
what did I do wrong?

22:59.247 --> 23:01.415
I understand how frustrated you are.

23:02.458 --> 23:04.502
I'd like to approach this differently.

23:05.920 --> 23:09.215
Yes, the little girl you raised is gone.

23:09.714 --> 23:11.424
She's a new woman now.

23:12.009 --> 23:14.345
And sometimes when we break free,

23:14.428 --> 23:18.224
we need
to push some people aside so we can...

23:18.724 --> 23:20.935
get in touch with our true selves.

23:37.577 --> 23:38.577
Hey.

23:39.203 --> 23:42.081
I have those notes on Allison,
if you wanna take a look.

23:42.164 --> 23:44.250
- Oh, thanks so much.
- No problem.

23:45.333 --> 23:48.836
Uh, just be careful, okay?
It's my only copy.

23:49.420 --> 23:51.339
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
- Great.

24:04.437 --> 24:06.037
It should feel like a challenge!

24:06.397 --> 24:08.274
You guys can't be weak in here!

24:08.941 --> 24:10.067
One-two, one-two.

24:10.401 --> 24:12.278
Snap those punches, bring 'em back.

24:12.360 --> 24:15.196
Excellent. Let's go! Get it!

24:15.947 --> 24:17.323
<i>Bring it back to the base.</i>

24:32.590 --> 24:34.717
You should always be ready for attack.

24:35.134 --> 24:37.386
Get in fight position
and grab a partner.

24:37.470 --> 24:40.056
And remember, no
one is as strong as you.

24:40.138 --> 24:41.848
- Hey.
- Hands up.

24:41.933 --> 24:43.643
Left-right, left-right.
One-two, one-two.

24:43.726 --> 24:45.811
Give her a little resistance.
Punch right here.

24:45.893 --> 24:47.812
Left-right, left-right, go!

24:47.897 --> 24:49.732
- Breathe.
- I will.

24:55.112 --> 24:56.792
<i>Hi, Jean, this is Mrs.
Finnegan.</i>

24:56.822 --> 24:59.200
<i>I wanted to go over
Dolly's test scores with you</i>

24:59.283 --> 25:01.911
<i>and see if you gave any more
thought to the medications.</i>

25:02.161 --> 25:05.539
<i>Let's set up a time to meet
and we can go through her options.</i>

25:05.623 --> 25:08.042
<i>I can be reached
at this number during school hours.</i>

25:08.960 --> 25:10.080
<i>I look forward to hearing...</i>

25:25.184 --> 25:27.228
<i>♪ I don't need a doctor ♪</i>

25:27.310 --> 25:29.854
<i>♪ I don't need a priest ♪</i>

25:29.937 --> 25:32.315

25:39.448 --> 25:43.578

25:47.248 --> 25:48.248
What the fuck?

25:49.041 --> 25:50.876
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

25:53.127 --> 25:55.129
Hey, guys, I want you to meet Diane.

25:55.798 --> 25:57.341
Diane is a...

25:58.424 --> 25:59.424
customer?

25:59.801 --> 26:00.801
Acquaintance?

26:01.511 --> 26:03.846
I mean, who are you? Really?

26:03.930 --> 26:06.098
You were at the party a few weeks ago.

26:06.182 --> 26:08.601
Yeah, hey, Frances.
It's nice to see you again.

26:08.686 --> 26:10.313
Yeah, you guys met.

26:11.522 --> 26:12.898
He thought you were hot.

26:14.066 --> 26:15.666
I should have asked
you what you thought.

26:16.444 --> 26:17.570
You're single, right?

26:18.152 --> 26:19.946
- Uh, yeah...
- I'd do him.

26:20.029 --> 26:22.657
- I have, actually.
- Come on, Sid, really?

26:22.741 --> 26:24.160
Well, she's not into women.

26:24.742 --> 26:26.160
So, you might have a shot.

26:27.411 --> 26:29.691
You know, I-I didn't
come here for this.

26:29.716 --> 26:30.605
No, I know.

26:30.665 --> 26:34.502
Max told me you're doing some piece
on music in New York

26:34.587 --> 26:37.548
or some other fucking bullshit
that sounds made up.

26:38.506 --> 26:40.508
Why can't you just
admit you wanna see me?

26:45.431 --> 26:47.266
That's what she does, she bails on you.

26:47.348 --> 26:48.641
Even when you need her.

26:48.724 --> 26:50.560
You're making this really easy for me.

26:50.645 --> 26:53.230
I actually came here
to have an honest conversation with you,

26:53.314 --> 26:56.067
to tell you that I
can't do this anymore.

26:56.817 --> 26:58.986
Well, this... isn't anything.

26:59.737 --> 27:01.405
So I'm not quite
sure what you're ending.

27:03.114 --> 27:05.157
But you're pretty reckless
with people's feelings.

27:05.243 --> 27:06.243
Excuse me?

27:06.285 --> 27:07.536
What was I supposed to do?

27:07.618 --> 27:10.538
Sit there with your ex-boyfriend
and listen to you catch up on old times?

27:10.621 --> 27:12.957
- That's not what it was.
- It's indulgent and reckless.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.001
If you wanna throw that word
around so easily.

27:16.002 --> 27:17.295
You know what? You're right.

27:18.047 --> 27:19.340
Just as well you weren't there,

27:19.423 --> 27:21.842
'cause we ended up fucking,
just like old times.

27:24.302 --> 27:25.636
Guess we're not that different.

27:26.264 --> 27:30.935
- Using people to get what we want...
- Don't put me in a category with you.

27:31.310 --> 27:32.812
We're nothing alike.

27:32.935 --> 27:36.564
You know what? You're right, because
I go for what I want and you're scared.

27:40.069 --> 27:41.445
You talk a big game.

27:42.695 --> 27:44.030
But when it comes down to it...

27:45.533 --> 27:47.743
you're just a scared little girl.

28:08.848 --> 28:10.266
Stacey picked up Dolly

28:10.349 --> 28:11.989
and the guys
are gonna be here any minute.

28:12.059 --> 28:14.312
Oh, she left? I
didn't get to say goodbye.

28:17.940 --> 28:19.942
Hey, when did you put a passcode
on your phone?

28:21.569 --> 28:22.570
Last week.

28:23.779 --> 28:24.780
Yeah, I just...

28:25.197 --> 28:28.075
I realized I have all this
sensitive patient information.

28:28.701 --> 28:30.703
You know, so if I lost my phone,

28:31.245 --> 28:32.288
it'd be a real issue.

28:32.371 --> 28:33.748
Mm-hmm. What is it?

28:36.500 --> 28:37.585
Your passcode.

28:39.170 --> 28:40.421
I can't tell you.

28:40.963 --> 28:41.963
It's private.

28:44.050 --> 28:45.301
You know mine.

28:49.762 --> 28:50.762
Honey...

28:54.310 --> 28:56.729
What is your passcode?

28:56.812 --> 28:58.147
Honey...

29:00.524 --> 29:01.651
What's your passcode?

29:22.962 --> 29:26.674
- Wow! Look at you.
- Oh, please, stop.

29:26.757 --> 29:28.209
You sure you don't wanna stay?

29:28.234 --> 29:30.410
I can't. I have a
psych thing to go to.

29:31.180 --> 29:32.640
You guys have fun, though.

29:33.224 --> 29:36.644
Plus, Michael never gets a guys' night,
so I don't wanna ruin it.

29:37.143 --> 29:38.894
Is Larin going to your psych thing?

29:39.478 --> 29:41.397
Uh, no. She can't make it tonight.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.774
She's doing that whole
singing thing now, right?

29:43.858 --> 29:46.902
Yeah, right. Uh, a cappella?
I had no idea.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.905
I barely knew.
Just shows how little you know someone.

29:52.868 --> 29:54.662
Are you taking the car or the train?

29:55.202 --> 29:57.496
The car. I won't be too late.

29:57.790 --> 29:58.833
Have fun, guys.

31:13.366 --> 31:14.366
<i>Yes?</i>

31:15.368 --> 31:16.953
Hello, uh...

31:17.036 --> 31:18.454
I'm here for dinner.

31:19.330 --> 31:20.330
<i>Come on up.</i>

31:38.057 --> 31:39.141
Oh, hi.

31:39.225 --> 31:41.102
- You're, uh...
- Diane.

31:41.851 --> 31:43.102
- So nice to meet you...
- Dax.

31:43.185 --> 31:45.271
Oh... Oh, hi.

31:46.899 --> 31:47.900
Wow.

31:47.982 --> 31:49.441
What an awesome space.

31:49.525 --> 31:51.861
Yeah. Yeah, we think so.

31:53.531 --> 31:55.533
- You can put your shoes right here.
- Oh, sure.

31:55.616 --> 31:57.243
- Yeah.
- Great. Okay.

32:01.622 --> 32:04.000
Oh, and if you could,
leave your device, too.

32:04.375 --> 32:06.002
We like to disconnect in the evenings.

32:06.085 --> 32:07.128
- Oh.
- Yeah.

32:07.211 --> 32:09.297
Okay. Um...

32:14.844 --> 32:16.637
- Diane?
- Hey!

32:16.721 --> 32:19.140
- It's so good to see you.
- So glad you made it.

32:19.972 --> 32:23.058
Oh, and um...
please don't mention the salon.

32:23.144 --> 32:26.063
- I told everyone that we met at yoga.
- Okay.

32:26.145 --> 32:30.149
- They would judge it as materialistic.
- Got it.

32:32.153 --> 32:33.404
This is Diane.

32:33.487 --> 32:36.782
Oh, hey! Hello! Hi!

32:37.698 --> 32:41.577
Jesus! Who runs the option
on third and six? Come on!

32:42.244 --> 32:43.996
I should've put money on this.

32:44.081 --> 32:45.416
Anyone know the spread?

32:45.499 --> 32:47.126
Uh, Steelers are getting six-and-a-half.

32:47.209 --> 32:49.629
- I think the over-under is 48.
- You make that up?

32:51.380 --> 32:53.883
- Oh, shit.
- Who is she?

32:55.216 --> 32:57.051
Uh, this girl I've been seeing.

32:57.635 --> 33:00.846
If you'd have told me a few years ago
I'd be seeing a 29-year-old...

33:02.556 --> 33:04.767
Fuck, man, she's hot.

33:06.270 --> 33:08.522
I try to get Jennifer
to be more adventurous...

33:08.606 --> 33:10.900
It's not like that.
She just wants to please me.

33:11.484 --> 33:13.903
It's the exact opposite
of my entire marriage.

33:14.278 --> 33:15.279
Let me see?

33:16.695 --> 33:19.156
So, do you guys
cook like this every night?

33:19.240 --> 33:20.574
Three nights a week.

33:21.244 --> 33:22.912
- Mmm.
- Cooking together's a ritual.

33:24.914 --> 33:25.748
Can I ask,

33:25.831 --> 33:28.876
do you guys have good relationships
with your real families?

33:28.960 --> 33:30.253
Don't say "real" to Dax.

33:30.336 --> 33:33.422
We believe we choose our families.

33:34.463 --> 33:35.923
Same way you choose who you are.

33:37.216 --> 33:38.676
Right. I get that.

33:38.759 --> 33:41.095
A lot of us maintain relationships
outside the group,

33:41.180 --> 33:43.683
- as long as they're accepting.
- Hmm.

33:43.766 --> 33:46.102
My family still thinks
I'm a ski bunny in Vermont.

33:47.436 --> 33:49.855
They would never understand
the concept of pure honesty.

33:50.648 --> 33:51.691
Pure honesty?

33:52.358 --> 33:54.068
The philosophy behind this place.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.402
No shame is too large.

33:59.115 --> 34:00.116
Hey, Diane.

34:04.870 --> 34:05.870
Diane?

34:06.664 --> 34:07.664
Hey.

34:08.414 --> 34:11.250
Can I steal her?
I wanna take her on a little tour.

34:12.168 --> 34:13.168
Yeah, of course.

35:01.302 --> 35:05.139
We just get so bogged
down by our choices,

35:05.222 --> 35:07.975
and they're represented by all this...

35:08.392 --> 35:09.560
- stuff.
- Hmm.

35:09.644 --> 35:13.731
Trust me, I could dig through my closet
and find remnants of my entire life.

35:13.814 --> 35:16.025
What do you really need?

35:16.940 --> 35:20.194
It just challenges you
to start anew every day.

35:20.778 --> 35:22.738
Not hang on to the past.

35:25.826 --> 35:27.036
How's your mom?

35:28.412 --> 35:29.830
Any progress?

35:30.623 --> 35:34.168
She's in this cycle
where she only sees things one way.

35:34.252 --> 35:35.586
She's not like me.

35:36.837 --> 35:37.838
Or you.

35:39.590 --> 35:42.343
The deeper I get
into my life here, I'm just...

35:42.426 --> 35:45.513
I'm realizing all of these things
I just couldn't face.

35:45.972 --> 35:46.972
Like what?

35:47.932 --> 35:49.642
How she used to manipulate me.

35:50.309 --> 35:52.395
Even before my dad got sick.

35:55.437 --> 35:56.939
When I was in high school,

35:58.317 --> 36:00.820
she bet me money
that I could lose weight.

36:01.487 --> 36:02.780
That's awful.

36:03.570 --> 36:04.822
I had no idea.

36:05.697 --> 36:06.865
Why would you?

36:07.533 --> 36:10.244
I wouldn't. I guess I...

36:11.078 --> 36:14.123
Sounds like she was just
trying to be helpful.

36:14.206 --> 36:15.332
Well, she wasn't.

36:18.129 --> 36:19.630
Look, I understand.

36:22.925 --> 36:28.180
I have a sister whose kid is dealing
with some identity issues.

36:28.472 --> 36:29.724
Gender confusion.

36:30.725 --> 36:33.519
And she can't really face it, so...

36:34.268 --> 36:37.980
Probably, to people on the outside,
it looks close-minded.

36:40.568 --> 36:42.612
But it all just stems from fear.

36:43.986 --> 36:45.988
It's probably the same with your mom.

36:46.071 --> 36:48.115
Well, everybody has their limits and...

36:49.785 --> 36:51.162
I can only take so much.

37:01.172 --> 37:03.424
That was the day
she moved me into my apartment.

37:04.006 --> 37:05.507
Oh, God.

37:06.427 --> 37:08.596
It was awful.

37:09.178 --> 37:10.429
So stressful.

37:10.765 --> 37:12.934
She probably remembers it differently.

37:14.558 --> 37:15.976
You know, the truth is...

37:16.977 --> 37:21.773
I don't think
anything can replace that connection.

37:25.152 --> 37:27.237
As hard as we both might try.

37:29.656 --> 37:33.535
<i>With each breath, you
are letting go of the stress.</i>

37:34.119 --> 37:35.787
The chaos of the day.

37:36.958 --> 37:38.334
Any negativity.

37:40.378 --> 37:42.922
Now breathe deeply.

37:44.465 --> 37:47.426
Feel your body beneath you.

37:49.303 --> 37:53.224
The only thing that is
real is this moment.

37:54.225 --> 37:55.476
Right here.

37:56.519 --> 37:58.020
Right now.

38:00.481 --> 38:02.858
As the world moves around you,

38:03.276 --> 38:06.028
you too are capable of moving.

38:07.196 --> 38:09.740
You are your single self.

38:11.284 --> 38:13.369
Not attached to anyone.

38:15.329 --> 38:19.625
Just as people and circumstances change,

38:20.501 --> 38:24.797
you also have a
greater power within you.

38:26.632 --> 38:31.429
The power to make your own choices.

38:32.430 --> 38:36.809
For your very best change.

38:43.897 --> 38:45.899
Have you ever heard of a vape?

38:45.983 --> 38:49.111
Hey, I can roll a fucking joint, okay?
I think.

38:49.194 --> 38:51.091
You smoke it, then you talk shit.

38:54.243 --> 38:55.243
Hey, babe.

38:58.080 --> 38:59.080
Yeah.

39:00.041 --> 39:01.334
Right after the game's done.

39:01.417 --> 39:02.877
Yeah, I'll be there, I promise.

39:02.958 --> 39:04.585
Can you text me the address?

39:06.670 --> 39:08.213
I hate him.

39:08.299 --> 39:10.676
Oh, come on, he went through
so much shit with the divorce.

39:10.757 --> 39:12.593
- He deserves a little happiness.
- I know.

39:13.596 --> 39:15.598
I'm just so bored with Jennifer.

39:17.892 --> 39:19.536
I wouldn't even know how
to want her anymore.

39:19.560 --> 39:21.771
Even if I did, she'd tell
me to go fuck myself

39:21.852 --> 39:23.604
or jerk off to some porn.

39:23.689 --> 39:25.900
Oh, jeez. That's rough, my friend.

39:28.027 --> 39:29.654
Sounds like another divorce.

39:32.406 --> 39:34.116
All right, you guys ready?

39:34.742 --> 39:35.742
Yeah.

39:36.241 --> 39:39.202
As you've heard tonight,
we have a philosophy of no secrets.

39:39.411 --> 39:42.664
So, as a way
of connecting more truthfully,

39:42.750 --> 39:44.126
we have this little ritual.

39:49.173 --> 39:51.300
Don't worry. It's fun.

39:51.381 --> 39:54.551
We each pick a phone
and read the most recent text out loud.

39:55.886 --> 39:57.304
And as our guest of honor...

40:00.518 --> 40:02.436
Okay... Um...

40:08.857 --> 40:10.108
Shit.

40:10.194 --> 40:11.195
That's mine.

40:13.030 --> 40:15.616
- Passcode?
- 7-1-8-7.

40:19.662 --> 40:22.331
Nate says, "Thanks for the air mattress.

40:22.415 --> 40:23.916
Return it next week."

40:37.680 --> 40:38.681
It's mine.

40:40.933 --> 40:41.933
Passcode?

40:43.686 --> 40:45.438
6-6-3-9.

40:51.944 --> 40:53.738
It's from Melissa S.

40:54.405 --> 40:55.239
What?

40:55.320 --> 40:57.823
"Stay the fuck out of my life."

40:58.532 --> 41:00.701
- Wow, all caps.
- Whoa.

41:01.284 --> 41:04.287
- What is that about, Diane?
- Just seems so angry.

41:05.205 --> 41:08.667
- It's a long story.
- Oh, no secrets, remember?

41:14.634 --> 41:17.345
Melissa Saugraves is a woman I...

41:18.846 --> 41:20.222
used to work with.

41:20.303 --> 41:22.597
Why is she telling you
to stay away from her?

41:27.936 --> 41:32.190
I had to end the friendship,
became too codependent.

41:32.401 --> 41:34.278
She started making up stories.

41:34.779 --> 41:37.990
Ultimately, she became...

41:38.658 --> 41:41.535
Well, she blamed me for her instability.

41:42.328 --> 41:43.496
It's complicated.

41:54.421 --> 41:55.982
- Hey, thanks for having me.
- All right.

41:56.006 --> 41:57.674
Yeah, bro. All right.

41:57.758 --> 42:00.010
Thank your girlfriend
for giving me jerk-off material.

42:00.554 --> 42:01.847
You're a dick. See ya.

42:01.931 --> 42:03.599
- See you, too.
- Lates.

42:06.266 --> 42:07.684
- Thank you.
- All right, brother.

42:07.768 --> 42:08.977
- All right?
- Yep.

42:09.060 --> 42:10.103
- See ya at work.
- Okay.

42:10.189 --> 42:12.483
- Hey. Thanks for the smoke, man.
- Yeah. Good night.

42:12.566 --> 42:13.734
- See you.
- Get home safe.

42:13.985 --> 42:15.194
I'll do my best.

42:19.907 --> 42:21.492
All right, let's give thanks.

42:27.456 --> 42:30.585
Thank you
for the company at tonight's table.

42:31.419 --> 42:32.419
We feel blessed.

42:33.504 --> 42:36.716
Thanks to everyone
for contributing to this meal.

42:38.381 --> 42:41.092
Diane, would you like to say anything?

42:41.927 --> 42:44.262
Uh, it's a tradition,
but you don't have to.

42:46.559 --> 42:48.811
No, I'd love to. Um...

42:51.897 --> 42:56.485
Well, first,
I'd like to say thank you for having me.

42:57.486 --> 43:01.157
You've all made me
feel so welcome and included.

43:01.240 --> 43:05.661
When the truth is I often feel
outside things in my normal life.

43:11.417 --> 43:15.546
<i>I'd like to say thank
you for this incredible space.</i>

43:15.630 --> 43:17.298
<i>And your energy.</i>

43:18.007 --> 43:19.759
I feel very connected here.

43:20.927 --> 43:23.262
It's nice to have that feeling again.

43:25.681 --> 43:29.143
<i>It's crazy, because you're
a room full of strangers,</i>

43:29.226 --> 43:31.646
<i>and yet, I feel like I belong.</i>

43:32.939 --> 43:36.484
I feel more like myself
than I felt in a long time.

43:37.068 --> 43:42.239
<i>Because I can be honest
and there's no judgment or expectation.</i>

43:42.782 --> 43:46.702
<i>♪ I wanna get inside your head ♪</i>

43:46.786 --> 43:50.498
<i>♪ I wanna get inside
I wanna get inside ♪</i>

43:50.581 --> 43:54.210
<i>♪ I wanna get inside ♪</i>

43:54.293 --> 43:57.171
<i>♪ I swear that I ♪</i>

43:57.255 --> 44:01.676
You guys don't know my stories, my past.

44:01.759 --> 44:02.927
All the history.

44:04.634 --> 44:10.473
So I get to be me in this
room, with you, all of you.

44:13.643 --> 44:14.644
<i>And so, um...</i>

44:15.228 --> 44:17.939
<i>in the spirit of pure honesty,</i>

44:20.027 --> 44:23.823
I guess I feel like I've been
living my life as two people.

44:25.950 --> 44:26.993
And...

44:29.662 --> 44:31.706
sometimes that gets confusing.

44:31.789 --> 44:34.584
Like, I don't know which one is real.

44:36.419 --> 44:38.421
Which one's most authentic.

44:40.715 --> 44:42.133
<i>'Cause I can play myself.</i>

44:42.216 --> 44:44.927
<i>I can give you a persona
to an alarming degree,</i>

44:45.008 --> 44:48.929
<i>where it's imperceptible
to the ones most close to me.</i>

44:50.766 --> 44:52.852
I... yeah,

44:52.935 --> 44:54.812
don't know who's in control anymore.

44:56.606 --> 44:57.815
Or who I wanna be.

44:59.150 --> 45:00.484
Does that make sense?

45:02.233 --> 45:03.353
Thank you for sharing.

45:04.614 --> 45:06.282
I hope you know this is a safe space.

45:06.571 --> 45:07.656
You're welcome anytime.

45:08.657 --> 45:09.657
Thank you.

45:10.200 --> 45:12.619
Sometimes all it takes
is a brave step forward.

45:13.664 --> 45:14.664
Thanks.

45:15.207 --> 45:17.668
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

45:17.749 --> 45:20.293
You're welcome.

46:11.222 --> 46:12.222
Hey.

46:13.888 --> 46:15.223
What do you want now?

46:41.419 --> 46:44.255
For the record, I'm not scared.

47:04.567 --> 47:06.235
- See you, guys.
- Okay.

47:09.947 --> 47:10.947
Jean?

47:13.451 --> 47:14.452
Jean!

49:14.780 --> 49:15.823
Hey, there.

49:16.699 --> 49:17.699
Hey.

49:18.701 --> 49:19.701
How was it?

49:21.787 --> 49:23.205
Oh, it was fun.

49:29.337 --> 49:30.504
How was your night?

49:30.588 --> 49:32.214
Oh, fine.

49:35.176 --> 49:36.302
Where were you?

49:39.805 --> 49:41.015
I told you.

49:42.308 --> 49:43.851
I had the psych thing, remember?

49:43.935 --> 49:46.729
I know, but where were you? Really?

49:54.779 --> 49:57.114
I see so many of these guys.

50:01.661 --> 50:02.995
Divorced.

50:04.330 --> 50:05.330
Struggling.

50:09.126 --> 50:11.128
I really don't want that to be us.

50:15.383 --> 50:17.343
Me too.

50:18.302 --> 50:19.428
Of course not.

50:27.687 --> 50:31.315
I booked us a night
in a nice hotel in the city next week.

50:32.024 --> 50:34.193
I know it's not Belize, but...

50:35.403 --> 50:40.074
at least it'll give us
a chance to reconnect.
