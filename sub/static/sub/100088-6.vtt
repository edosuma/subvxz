you'll bounce back.

11:20.201 --> 11:23.160
The only bouncing that's in
Sonny Quinn's future

11:23.204 --> 11:25.162
is in the
champagne room.

11:25.206 --> 11:28.165
[chuckles]

11:28.209 --> 11:30.211
Why do you think she did it
out of the blue?

11:30.254 --> 11:31.255
You think someone
got in her ear?

11:33.736 --> 11:36.217
RAY:
Bravo 6, what's your sitrep?

11:38.132 --> 11:40.395
Yeah, it's, uh,
it's all quiet up here.

11:40.438 --> 11:42.440
RAY:
Roger that. Bravo 2 out.

11:42.484 --> 11:43.703
[exhales]

11:44.834 --> 11:47.315
Yeah.

11:47.358 --> 11:50.274
I think maybe someone
did get in her head.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.233
[indistinct radio chatter]

11:52.276 --> 11:54.104
Anything good on TV?

11:54.148 --> 11:56.106
A little too much
action for my taste.

11:56.150 --> 11:57.978
[exhales]
Well, it's a good thing

11:58.021 --> 12:00.763
that the enemy
took a commercial break, huh?Yeah.

12:00.807 --> 12:03.897
[exhales]The cameras outside the
wall don't show much.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.812
All clear for now.

12:05.855 --> 12:08.162
Hey, I scrounged up some coffee
in the kitchen. You want some?

12:08.205 --> 12:09.598
Yeah, I would kill
for some.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.514
[exhales]

12:16.387 --> 12:19.216
New gig wasn't supposed to
put you in the action so deep.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.871
Ray was saying you were
practically Bravo 3

12:21.915 --> 12:23.133
while you were held up.

12:23.177 --> 12:24.352
[chuckles]
I wouldn't go that far,

12:24.395 --> 12:27.790
but I did develop
a sudden taste for Skoal

12:27.834 --> 12:29.313
and human anatomy jokes.

12:29.357 --> 12:30.793
I knew you had it in you.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.144
I'll get a little worried,
though,

12:34.188 --> 12:36.277
if you start chugging beer
out of Bojinka's leg.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.148
[chuckles]

12:38.192 --> 12:40.585
Uh, this kind of work
is what drew me

12:40.629 --> 12:42.109
to the Agency
to begin with.

12:42.152 --> 12:44.372
Sitting behind a laptop
is not why I joined.

12:44.415 --> 12:47.157
Never saw you as a desk jockey,
that's for sure.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.724
Never saw that Mandy.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.552
Maybe that's why we've
always gotten along so well.Mm.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.904
I haven't seen much of you
since Belgrade. How's it going?

12:54.948 --> 12:56.732
Good. Well,
the team is, you know,

12:56.776 --> 12:58.778
keeping their edge,
kicking in doors,

12:58.821 --> 13:00.388
taking care of business.
Good.

13:00.431 --> 13:03.217
Okay, well, how about you?
Outside of Bravo?

13:04.218 --> 13:07.525
Me? Yeah.

13:07.569 --> 13:10.050
You know...

13:10.093 --> 13:11.442
not exactly
what I thought

13:11.486 --> 13:14.402
I would have drawn up
20 years ago, but...

13:14.445 --> 13:17.274
guy like me?

13:18.406 --> 13:20.277
Guess I'm good.
Yeah, I'm good.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.671
Well, we all want life
to happen on our own terms,

13:22.714 --> 13:26.109
but how often does that
actually work out?Well,

13:26.153 --> 13:28.720
this type of work-- never,
that's for sure.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.246
What was that?

13:32.289 --> 13:34.726
What's that?
Play that back.

13:34.770 --> 13:37.077
Whoa.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.861
Enemy's in the compound.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.950
All Bravo Team,
we got Tangos on the inside.

13:45.955 --> 13:48.566
How many?Least two
that I saw.

13:48.610 --> 13:49.785
It's gonna be tough
keeping eyes on the outside

13:49.829 --> 13:50.786
when we're hunting
enemy inside.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.179
All right, Metal,
this is 1.

13:52.222 --> 13:54.355
Meet us at the main entrance
of the residence ASAP.

13:58.446 --> 14:00.187
Bravo 6, at your six.
How copy?

14:02.015 --> 14:03.799
Bravo 6 to Bravo 1.
I've got you.

14:11.154 --> 14:13.243
[panting]

14:13.287 --> 14:15.115
[grunting][gunshot]

14:19.771 --> 14:21.686
[both grunting]

14:26.169 --> 14:28.998
[gunfire]

14:43.578 --> 14:44.753
[choking]

14:52.935 --> 14:53.936
[gun clicks empty]

14:57.635 --> 14:59.028
You owe me, Ray.

14:59.072 --> 15:01.117
[panting]:
I had him.

15:01.161 --> 15:02.162
[gunfire nearby]

15:08.516 --> 15:10.213
Compound's clear.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.041
How'd they gain access?

15:12.085 --> 15:14.043
Must have jumped the east wall.
I found a section of carpet

15:14.087 --> 15:15.653
tossed over
the razor wire there.JASON: Look,

15:15.697 --> 15:17.003
this can't happen again.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.181
Full Metal, what do you got?

15:21.224 --> 15:22.878
GPS tracker.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.228
All right, I'll go
get this to Mandy.

15:25.272 --> 15:27.187
Check the blind spots,
get a roving patrol.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.015
Check.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.152
Then keep trying,
work your sources.

15:36.196 --> 15:37.937
Find a way
to get through.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.199
Ma'am, we've resecured
the compound.

15:39.242 --> 15:40.417
Helos are ten minutes out.

15:40.461 --> 15:41.984
Nice work, but I may
need longer than that.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.725
Longer is not
an option.

15:43.768 --> 15:45.727
I tracked down a Hashid elder
that might have some influence.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.816
They're getting him
on the line.Tell me when you have him.

15:47.859 --> 15:49.296
You have to get
your people together.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.167
We got to evacuate.They're ready. I'm not.

15:51.211 --> 15:53.169
The Hashid tribe is mobilizing

15:53.213 --> 15:55.693
to assault any
remaining Bakil forces.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.521
That's good. We could
get our helos in then.

15:57.565 --> 16:00.133
Open war between these tribes
will bulldoze any hope of peace

16:00.176 --> 16:01.743
in this region
for generations.

16:01.786 --> 16:05.138
If I leave before getting
the Hashid to stand down,

16:05.181 --> 16:09.185
this devolves
into a bloodbath.

16:09.229 --> 16:12.275
Now that bloodbath
will be on my hands.

16:12.319 --> 16:14.234
Our country's hands.

16:14.277 --> 16:17.106
I can't leave until I've
completed my mission.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.195
I understand that,
but we got to roll.

16:19.239 --> 16:21.589
Don't have time.Hey, wait a minute.

16:21.632 --> 16:23.156
See, you're a lot like me.

16:23.199 --> 16:28.335
You could be riding a desk in
some air-conditioned op center

16:28.378 --> 16:30.641
instead of dodging
bullets at your age.

16:30.685 --> 16:34.210
So you understand exactly

16:34.254 --> 16:38.084
why I... can'tleave.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.175
Everyone's set.
Holding fast.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.525
Helos are eight mikes out.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.701
You got eight minutes.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.051
Come on.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.314
Let's go!
Come on!

16:55.101 --> 16:57.059
Yeah, sorry I didn't
clean off the blood.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.321
It's their blood, not ours.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.193
Doesn't bother me.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.325
Let's see what
our intruders were up to.

17:02.369 --> 17:05.198
They weren't inside long,
you know. We took 'em out fast.

17:06.721 --> 17:10.246
Cell phone sent one text
before we spotted them.

17:10.290 --> 17:13.162
Message went
to a dozen contacts.

17:13.206 --> 17:15.338
What does the
message say?

17:15.382 --> 17:16.905
It's a string of numbers.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.950
Well, they definitely
weren't playing Keno.

17:18.994 --> 17:21.083
GPS coordinates.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.389
They were tagging targets.

17:22.432 --> 17:25.131
They only sent one location.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.223
This building.

17:30.266 --> 17:33.313
We've got to get everybody
out of here.Got to move.

17:33.356 --> 17:35.097
Ma'am, the helos are inbound.
Two mikes.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.272
Bravo should have
a visual on them soon.

17:36.316 --> 17:37.882
Thank you, IT2. Sir?

17:37.926 --> 17:39.188
Come take a look at this.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.670
Sir, the enemy appears
to be prepping

17:42.713 --> 17:44.193
for a second-wave assault.

17:44.237 --> 17:45.499
I see it.

17:45.542 --> 17:48.676
Looks like they're setting up
mortar positions.

17:48.719 --> 17:52.158
The compound is not under fire,
the LZ is still clear.

17:52.201 --> 17:54.899
Well, you're looking at the
same picture I am, Ensign.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.379
The helos'll probably
make it in,

17:56.423 --> 17:57.946
but once those mortars
start dropping...

17:57.989 --> 18:00.688
Helos are gonna get torn up
along with everyone in 'em.

18:00.731 --> 18:02.168
Exactly.

18:02.211 --> 18:04.213
I need to wave 'em off.

18:06.694 --> 18:09.088
Orzet 1-8, this is Havoc Base.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.350
Be advised you have multiple

18:10.393 --> 18:12.178
enemy mortar positions
on target.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.223
This is a hot LZ.
Abort extract.

18:14.267 --> 18:15.877
I say again,
abort extract.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.227
Havoc Base, this is Orzet 1-8.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.229
We copy. Hot LZ. We are RTB.

18:20.273 --> 18:22.449
All right.
I'll call the boys.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.407
Sir, it was my call.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.279
I should tell them.

18:29.891 --> 18:31.849
Bravo 1, this is Havoc Base.

18:31.893 --> 18:33.416
Be advised

18:33.460 --> 18:34.678
you have major enemy activity

18:34.722 --> 18:36.332
surrounding
the diplomatic compound,

18:36.376 --> 18:38.682
including at least three
mortar positions.

18:38.726 --> 18:41.903
That's a good copy, Havoc.
How far out is the exfil?

18:41.946 --> 18:43.426
The helo extract
has been waved off.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.428
[groans]

18:45.472 --> 18:47.952
I say again, your helo
extract has been aborted.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.389
We can't bring 'em
into a hot LZ.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.740
Ah, that's a good copy, Havoc.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.618
Havoc, this is 1.

19:01.662 --> 19:03.359
They're dialing in
on the residence.

19:03.403 --> 19:05.318
We have to move everybody
to the south building.

19:05.361 --> 19:06.580
DAVIS:
Copy, 1.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.323
Move! Move.What happened
with the helicopters?

19:10.366 --> 19:11.454
Where are they?Move!

19:11.498 --> 19:13.717
[alarm sounding]Got to move. Let's go.

19:13.761 --> 19:15.328
Move! Move!
South building.

19:15.371 --> 19:17.417
Everyone in the back.
On your left.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.549
Move! Move! Move! Move!

19:19.593 --> 19:21.160
Move! Move! Move![alarm sounding]

19:21.203 --> 19:22.813
Move! Move!

19:28.079 --> 19:30.081
Everybody inside! Move!

19:32.649 --> 19:35.217
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

19:35.261 --> 19:37.350
[explosion]

19:37.393 --> 19:39.265
Stay with me, everyone!

19:39.308 --> 19:41.267
[explosion]

19:41.310 --> 19:43.573
Basement, get 'em to
the basement. Everybody.

19:43.617 --> 19:46.097
Everybody, stay with me!
Stay with me!

19:46.141 --> 19:47.490
[loud rumbling]

19:47.534 --> 19:49.318
Hey, what the
hell was that?

19:49.362 --> 19:51.364
I don't know,
let's go find out.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.891
[alarm continues sounding]

19:58.458 --> 20:01.809
VBID just ripped
this wall right open.Yeah, yeah.

20:01.852 --> 20:04.420
Take that guy out.

20:04.464 --> 20:05.769
Havoc this is 1.
They breached

20:05.813 --> 20:07.423
the outer compound.
We're gonna be overrun.

20:13.081 --> 20:15.301
[gunfire]

20:24.832 --> 20:26.616
RAY:
Soften us up with mortars, then
send a VBID through the wall.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.401
Somebody's out there
thinking, brother.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.316
Okay, tell you what.
We'll flank 'em. Hey.

20:30.359 --> 20:33.493
You guys stay here.
Clay, with me. Move.

20:33.536 --> 20:36.060
[gunfire]

20:46.680 --> 20:48.638
[men shouting]

20:48.682 --> 20:51.032
They're trying to take
that DShK.

20:51.075 --> 20:52.294
We got to keep them out there.

20:53.904 --> 20:56.080
I got an idea.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.519
Spense, hold! Stop!

21:14.664 --> 21:15.622
Damn it.

21:15.665 --> 21:18.189
[gunshots]

21:37.861 --> 21:39.254
[gasps]

21:48.698 --> 21:50.396
[gunfire stops]

22:00.623 --> 22:02.495
Spenser, move!

22:15.246 --> 22:16.683
Think we bought ourselves
a little time.

22:16.726 --> 22:18.293
Yeah, but tell you what,
you get an idea like that again,

22:18.337 --> 22:20.077
you come to me first,
you understand?

22:20.121 --> 22:22.341
Sounds good, boss.
Hey, you good?

22:22.384 --> 22:23.777
I'm fine.
You're limping.

22:23.820 --> 22:26.345
Overwatch, keep an eye
on the breech point.

22:34.527 --> 22:38.139
[indistinct radio chatter]

22:38.182 --> 22:40.141
Our guys ain't gonna
hold out much longer

22:40.184 --> 22:41.969
now that I called off
their lifeline.

22:42.012 --> 22:45.320
Yeah, well, look
at the residence.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.105
Helos would've
suffered the same fate.

22:48.149 --> 22:51.500
Then why do I feel like I just
left our team out to dry?

22:51.544 --> 22:53.284
'Cause you did.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.377
Feeling that way's better
than having two birds downed

22:58.420 --> 23:01.423
with everyone inside,
your team included.

23:01.467 --> 23:05.209
Bravo's still alive,
and they are fighting.

23:05.253 --> 23:07.647
We're gonna
get them out,

23:07.690 --> 23:11.477
but only if
you're at 100%.

23:13.479 --> 23:16.351
I'm there.
Let's bring them home.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.397
Let's bring them home.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.885
All right, listen up, hey.

23:28.929 --> 23:31.148
Suggestion box is open.
What do you think?

23:31.192 --> 23:33.455
I say we pull the pin
on this Atomic Blond

23:33.499 --> 23:34.804
and throw it over
the wall again.

39:35.285 --> 39:36.591
You know what,
we can...

39:36.635 --> 39:39.028
pour one out
for the ambassador.

39:39.072 --> 39:41.901
She was, uh...
she was different, wasn't she?

39:41.944 --> 39:43.468
They broke the mold

39:43.511 --> 39:45.470

kicker in her than politician.

39:51.432 --> 39:52.390

39:52.433 --> 39:54.087
Just, um...

39:54.130 --> 39:57.873

could do for her, you know?

39:57.917 --> 39:59.832
Me, too, brother.

39:59.875 --> 40:02.356
Me, too.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.924
Come on.
