WEBVTT

00:07.224 --> 00:10.010
Previously onSEAL Team...Goodbye.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.620
You and Davis. How long
have you two been playing house

00:11.663 --> 00:13.578
behind the team's back?It is so good to see
that you're back

00:13.622 --> 00:15.493
on your damn
high horse again.

00:15.537 --> 00:18.366
We look at the way you move,
fight, sleep, eat, breathe,

00:18.409 --> 00:20.629
and we figure out ways
to help you do

00:20.672 --> 00:22.500
every single one of
those things better.

00:22.544 --> 00:23.849
Everything about you
so clean and tight,

00:23.893 --> 00:25.373
I don't trust it. You have
to prove yourself to me,

00:25.416 --> 00:26.548
and the only way to do that
is by showing up

00:26.591 --> 00:27.592
when our ass is in the fire.

00:27.636 --> 00:29.725
Till then,
just stay out of my way.

00:29.768 --> 00:32.293
U.S. Ambassador Nicole Marsden
is traveling to North Yemen

00:32.336 --> 00:34.425
to ease tensions
between two tribes there,

00:34.469 --> 00:35.687
the Bakil and the Hashid.

00:35.731 --> 00:37.733
The Bakil are led by a madman!

00:37.776 --> 00:39.561
It is an insult to me that you
would meet with such a man.

00:39.604 --> 00:41.780
Meeting is the only way to talk.

00:41.824 --> 00:43.521
"Diplomacy's a process.

00:43.565 --> 00:45.610
Don't rock the boat."

00:45.654 --> 00:47.395
Navy's not
real big on vessel rocking.

00:47.438 --> 00:49.527
We all got to start rocking it.

00:49.571 --> 00:52.530
Lady's something else.More focused on the task
at hand than her career.

00:52.574 --> 00:54.402
Not exactly following
the politician playbook.

00:54.445 --> 00:56.578
There's a situation developing
near the compound.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.536
[gunfire][yelling]

00:58.580 --> 01:00.451
This is Bravo 2.

01:00.495 --> 01:02.236
We got troops in contact.
I say again, troops in contact.

01:02.279 --> 01:03.802
I've got a man down.

01:05.587 --> 01:07.676
Move, move, move, move.

01:20.689 --> 01:22.125
Ensign Davis, do you believe
you can find them

01:22.169 --> 01:23.605
a safe path to the airport?

01:23.648 --> 01:26.651
This is verging on a
Blackwater Fallujah scenario,

01:26.695 --> 01:28.740
and I don't want these boys
hanging from a bridge.

01:28.784 --> 01:30.699
You understand?Yes, sir.

01:30.742 --> 01:33.615
Three soft-skin vehicles evading
an unknown number of enemy

01:33.658 --> 01:36.531
for six miles.And we'll be with them
for every inch of it.

01:40.491 --> 01:42.711
Sonny, Brock, Metal, pull
the cars around here.

01:42.754 --> 01:45.801
[gunfire]Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:48.586 --> 01:50.414
Incoming!

[screaming]

01:52.808 --> 01:54.679
Cover!

02:02.034 --> 02:04.124
Havoc, this is 1.
We have no way out of here.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.169
ERIC:
Stand by, 1. Working on it now.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.779
We got to move these people!

02:07.823 --> 02:09.607
[shouting]
Go!

02:09.651 --> 02:10.869
[gunfire]

02:10.913 --> 02:12.871
Go, go, go!

02:17.659 --> 02:20.140
[panicked chatter]

02:22.098 --> 02:23.926
Fall back!

02:25.014 --> 02:26.668
Come on!

02:29.714 --> 02:31.716
Go, go, go!

02:33.631 --> 02:36.068
Last man!

02:46.122 --> 02:47.863
MAN [over radio]:
All stations, this is Bravo 5.

02:47.906 --> 02:49.473
Be advised...

02:49.517 --> 02:52.476
My people are all accounted for.
They're terrified but alive.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.870
Keep them down here
and keep them calm. Got it?Got it.

02:54.913 --> 02:57.655
What's the word, brother?All right. Clay,
Brock, Vic, Metal,

02:57.699 --> 02:59.091
up on the roof.Let's go.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.615
Sonny, you're with me.

03:00.658 --> 03:02.660
Time to put some numbers
on the board, boys.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.793
Chief? Sir? Sir?

03:04.836 --> 03:06.925
Uh, I don't need to tell you
the urgency of evacuating

03:06.969 --> 03:09.580
the ambassador and her
immediate staff...No, you sure don't.

03:09.624 --> 03:10.929
There-There's still a
car on the property.

03:10.973 --> 03:12.714
Hey, go sharpen
some pencils, all right?

03:12.757 --> 03:13.976
And put some earplugs in.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.891
Is Daniel causing problems?

03:15.934 --> 03:17.240
Oh, Bill Nye the Science Guy's
exactly

03:17.284 --> 03:18.372
what this situation ordered.

03:18.415 --> 03:19.634
Sonny, shut it.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.853
Daniel's greater good is Daniel.

03:21.897 --> 03:23.507
However, he steps
out of line again,

03:23.551 --> 03:25.248
we send him out
as target practice.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.032
Yes, ma'am.Ooh-ee.

03:27.076 --> 03:30.993
Ambassador's got some swag.[indistinct radio chatter]

03:31.036 --> 03:32.734
Mortars, rockets.

03:32.777 --> 03:34.997
The Bakil forces are mounting
a full coordinated assault.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.694
Five minutes, everyone.

03:36.738 --> 03:39.697
I need anything even resembling
an exfil option on my desk.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.177
Wheels, rotors,
whatever's gonna get

03:41.221 --> 03:42.526
our people
the hell out of there.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.659
Yeah, without escalating
the situation.

03:44.702 --> 03:47.618
Bravo 2, this is Havoc.
Radio check, over.

03:47.662 --> 03:48.706
RAY:
Good check. Go for 2.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.317
Yeah, I need a sitrep.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.014
ISR feed is clouded with smoke.

03:52.057 --> 03:53.929
We're working
on an exfil platform now,

03:53.972 --> 03:55.887
but we need to know
what we're looking at.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.802
We've got eight evacuees along
with Athena, plus one DSSA,

03:57.846 --> 03:59.587
wounded but stable.

03:59.630 --> 04:02.372
We're strong-holding the
compound from three positions.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.896
Taking rockets and mortar fire
from an unknown number

04:04.940 --> 04:06.550
of enemy combatants with SAF

04:06.594 --> 04:10.511
and at least three
vehicles with heavy guns.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.556
We've seen enough of
this place, Havoc.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.690
Uber out of here would be
real nice right about now.

04:15.733 --> 04:17.953
Yeah, we're working on it now.
Hang in there.

04:17.996 --> 04:19.998
Havoc out.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.886
Rocket. They're probably
loading it.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.888
What is it?

04:39.931 --> 04:41.890
Think it's a GTB-7S.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.674
You do realize the fact
that you can tell that

04:43.718 --> 04:44.762
from here is a bit
freakish, right?

04:44.806 --> 04:47.809
I like freakish.
[chuckles]

04:47.852 --> 04:49.941
Ready?
Yeah.

the gate, boss!

05:18.666 --> 05:21.277
Hit 'em!

CLAY: Hold what you got. Hold
what you got. Save your ammo.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.247
We're going nowhere fast.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.466
Roger that.

Hey. Hey, north side,
get some fire on that guy.

Moving.

06:37.658 --> 06:40.617
You think they're retreating?

06:43.968 --> 06:45.535
Where the hell'd they all go?

06:45.579 --> 06:47.015
I was just getting
in the zone.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.242
Hey, it got awfully quiet.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.290
They're reloading.

07:02.509 --> 07:05.468
They're regrouping.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.470
Bravo 2, what have you got?

07:07.514 --> 07:09.777
RAY: I don't know, it looks like
they all pulled back.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.169
Bravo 6, need a sitrep.

07:11.213 --> 07:14.303
Yeah, enemy bugged
out all at once.

07:14.346 --> 07:16.784
They're all on comms.
They're coordinated.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.089
They're planning
a second attack.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.614
Let's go. Back in the residence.

07:28.056 --> 07:30.798
Sir, I've got
three helos spinning up.

Capacity to pull everyone
off of the compound

07:36.368 --> 07:38.414
and get them back
to the airfield.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.677
100 klicks, we're looking at...They're gonna be there
within an hour.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.723
Nice work, Ensign Davis.Sir, there is an issue.

07:42.766 --> 07:45.116
Let me guess: they
won't fly into a hot LZ?

07:45.160 --> 07:46.988
Not in daylight hours, at least.Understandable.

07:47.031 --> 07:50.382
Well, let's hope
the LZ stays quiet.

07:50.426 --> 07:52.689
40 minutes until help arrives?

07:52.733 --> 07:54.082
Long as everything
remains quiet.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.518
Fact that we're
still standing

07:55.562 --> 07:57.520
is a testament
to you and your team.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.000
We're just doing our job.

07:59.043 --> 08:02.743
Wish I was as good at my job
as you seem to be at yours.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.571
Well, it's a lot easier to
convince people to pick up guns

08:04.614 --> 08:06.137
than it is to put them down.

08:06.181 --> 08:07.574
DANIEL:
They need to
evacuate you

08:07.617 --> 08:10.446
right now, okay? There's still
a car on the grounds.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.622
We can be transported out.MARSDEN:
Daniel,

08:12.666 --> 08:16.060
I'm not jumping into a lifeboat
before my staff.

08:16.104 --> 08:19.673
I don't go
until everyone goes.

08:19.716 --> 08:21.501
Uh, yes, ma'am.

08:21.544 --> 08:25.505
Why don't you go see if any of
our dear colleagues need help.

JASON:
Amazing how fear
can reveal a person.

08:31.119 --> 08:34.122
I'm sure he'll be the first
one out when our helos arrive.

08:34.165 --> 08:37.081
Not first,
but only because his lips

08:37.125 --> 08:39.127
are permanently attached
to my ass.

08:39.170 --> 08:40.302

08:47.048 --> 08:48.745
Yo.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.094
How you holding up?

08:50.138 --> 08:53.620
Kid bagged a couple barbarians
at the gate.

08:53.663 --> 08:56.057
Always be careful
of the quiet ones.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.449
CLAY:
They were just
chumming the waters

08:57.493 --> 08:58.929
with the old B team
on that wave.

08:58.973 --> 09:00.670
Not exactly heavy lifting.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.106
SONNY:
There will be more
coming for sure.

09:02.150 --> 09:04.108
Yeah, well,
we all pull our own weight

09:04.152 --> 09:06.415
and pull in the same direction,
we'll be good, right, Spenser?

09:11.246 --> 09:12.726
Yeah, I'm-a go upstairs.

Hitting the roof.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.034
VIC:
You know,

09:17.078 --> 09:18.253
I don't think he likes me much.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.124
SONNY:
Neither do I.

09:20.168 --> 09:21.430
Don't take it personal, though.

09:21.473 --> 09:23.650
Ain't nobody like
the new guy.

09:23.693 --> 09:26.000
It's true.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.654
I like the kid.

09:27.697 --> 09:30.004
Now clean that up.

09:32.136 --> 09:33.616
[chuckles]

09:40.667 --> 09:42.973
Ain't a good look for you, Clay.

09:43.017 --> 09:46.237
What's that?

09:46.281 --> 09:48.065
Look, I'm all about

09:48.109 --> 09:50.154
putting Green Team meat
through the grinder.

09:50.198 --> 09:52.809
Holding up the standard,
guarding the gate,

09:52.853 --> 09:55.812
but how
you're treating Vic, man,

09:55.856 --> 09:59.163
there something sideways
with you?

09:59.207 --> 10:01.252
I'm fine.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.080
I get it.

10:03.124 --> 10:04.821
You're not the new guy
on the team anymore

10:04.865 --> 10:07.041
and you're not in a place where
you can be calling the shots.

10:07.084 --> 10:08.303
Is that it?

10:08.346 --> 10:10.087
And?

10:10.131 --> 10:14.004
And ambition is a dirty word.

10:14.048 --> 10:15.789
You just got to be happy
where you are, brother.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.834
Why are we talking
about me right now

10:17.878 --> 10:19.314
when-when you're the one
who's going sideways?

10:19.357 --> 10:21.316
Since when do you beg
to work PSD?

10:21.359 --> 10:25.450
Since Yemen has been
on my bucket list, Clay.

10:25.494 --> 10:30.020
They got this brown-meat stew
that's supposedly to die for.

10:30.064 --> 10:32.632
There's no frickin' way
that you volunteer to work

10:32.675 --> 10:34.677
a personal security gig unless
something's up with you, man.

10:34.721 --> 10:35.896
Hey, nothing's up.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.898
I just didn't want
to miss out on the fun.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.943
Yeah, okay.

10:39.987 --> 10:41.858
Go ahead, sit there
and suffer in silence,

10:41.902 --> 10:43.251
but I know something's
up with you.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.298
[sighs]

10:47.342 --> 10:49.910
She ended it with me.

10:49.953 --> 10:53.348
Your girl?
Yeah.

10:53.391 --> 10:55.263
Why?
Ain't no why.

10:55.306 --> 10:58.048
Uh, just out of the blue.
It is what it is.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.571
Serves me right, though.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.051
Why do you say that?

11:01.095 --> 11:03.488
[chuckling]:
I just...

11:03.532 --> 11:06.753
I ain't ever opened myself up
like that with anyone before.

11:06.796 --> 11:09.625
And I ain't ever
gonna do it again.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.846
But I'll tell you what.
I'll go get myself a dog.

11:12.889 --> 11:16.023
Yeah. 'Cause the worse thing
that little thing can do to me

11:16.066 --> 11:18.199
is crap in my Stetson.

11:18.242 --> 11:20.157
It's all right, man,
you'll bounce back.

11:20.201 --> 11:23.160
The only bouncing that's in
Sonny Quinn's future

11:23.204 --> 11:25.162
is in the
champagne room.

11:25.206 --> 11:28.165
[chuckles]

11:28.209 --> 11:30.211
Why do you think she did it
out of the blue?

11:30.254 --> 11:31.255
You think someone
got in her ear?

11:33.736 --> 11:36.217
RAY:
Bravo 6, what's your sitrep?

11:38.132 --> 11:40.395
Yeah, it's, uh,
it's all quiet up here.

11:40.438 --> 11:42.440
RAY:
Roger that. Bravo 2 out.

11:42.484 --> 11:43.703
[exhales]

11:44.834 --> 11:47.315
Yeah.

11:47.358 --> 11:50.274
I think maybe someone
did get in her head.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.233
[indistinct radio chatter]

11:52.276 --> 11:54.104
Anything good on TV?

11:54.148 --> 11:56.106
A little too much
action for my taste.

11:56.150 --> 11:57.978
[exhales]
Well, it's a good thing

11:58.021 --> 12:00.763
that the enemy
took a commercial break, huh?Yeah.

12:00.807 --> 12:03.897
[exhales]The cameras outside the
wall don't show much.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.812
All clear for now.

12:05.855 --> 12:08.162
Hey, I scrounged up some coffee
in the kitchen. You want some?

12:08.205 --> 12:09.598
Yeah, I would kill
for some.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.514
[exhales]

12:16.387 --> 12:19.216
New gig wasn't supposed to
put you in the action so deep.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.871
Ray was saying you were
practically Bravo 3

12:21.915 --> 12:23.133
while you were held up.

12:23.177 --> 12:24.352
[chuckles]
I wouldn't go that far,

12:24.395 --> 12:27.790
but I did develop
a sudden taste for Skoal

12:27.834 --> 12:29.313
and human anatomy jokes.

12:29.357 --> 12:30.793
I knew you had it in you.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.144
I'll get a little worried,
though,

12:34.188 --> 12:36.277
if you start chugging beer
out of Bojinka's leg.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.148
[chuckles]

12:38.192 --> 12:40.585
Uh, this kind of work
is what drew me

12:40.629 --> 12:42.109
to the Agency
to begin with.

12:42.152 --> 12:44.372
Sitting behind a laptop
is not why I joined.

12:44.415 --> 12:47.157
Never saw you as a desk jockey,
that's for sure.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.724
Never saw that Mandy.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.552
Maybe that's why we've
always gotten along so well.Mm.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.904
I haven't seen much of you
since Belgrade. How's it going?

12:54.948 --> 12:56.732
Good. Well,
the team is, you know,

12:56.776 --> 12:58.778
keeping their edge,
kicking in doors,

12:58.821 --> 13:00.388
taking care of business.
Good.

13:00.431 --> 13:03.217
Okay, well, how about you?
Outside of Bravo?

13:04.218 --> 13:07.525
Me? Yeah.

13:07.569 --> 13:10.050
You know...

13:10.093 --> 13:11.442
not exactly
what I thought

13:11.486 --> 13:14.402
I would have drawn up
20 years ago, but...

13:14.445 --> 13:17.274
guy like me?

13:18.406 --> 13:20.277
Guess I'm good.
Yeah, I'm good.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.671
Well, we all want life
to happen on our own terms,

13:22.714 --> 13:26.109
but how often does that
actually work out?Well,

13:26.153 --> 13:28.720
this type of work-- never,
that's for sure.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.246
What was that?

13:32.289 --> 13:34.726
What's that?
Play that back.

13:34.770 --> 13:37.077
Whoa.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.861
Enemy's in the compound.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.950
All Bravo Team,
we got Tangos on the inside.

13:45.955 --> 13:48.566
How many?Least two
that I saw.

13:48.610 --> 13:49.785
It's gonna be tough
keeping eyes on the outside

13:49.829 --> 13:50.786
when we're hunting
enemy inside.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.179
All right, Metal,
this is 1.

13:52.222 --> 13:54.355
Meet us at the main entrance
of the residence ASAP.

13:58.446 --> 14:00.187
Bravo 6, at your six.
How copy?

14:02.015 --> 14:03.799
Bravo 6 to Bravo 1.
I've got you.

14:11.154 --> 14:13.243
[panting]

14:13.287 --> 14:15.115
[grunting][gunshot]

14:19.771 --> 14:21.686
[both grunting]

14:26.169 --> 14:28.998
[gunfire]

14:43.578 --> 14:44.753
[choking]

14:52.935 --> 14:53.936
[gun clicks empty]

14:57.635 --> 14:59.028
You owe me, Ray.

14:59.072 --> 15:01.117
[panting]:
I had him.

15:01.161 --> 15:02.162
[gunfire nearby]

15:08.516 --> 15:10.213
Compound's clear.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.041
How'd they gain access?

15:12.085 --> 15:14.043
Must have jumped the east wall.
I found a section of carpet

15:14.087 --> 15:15.653
tossed over
the razor wire there.JASON: Look,

15:15.697 --> 15:17.003
this can't happen again.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.181
Full Metal, what do you got?

15:21.224 --> 15:22.878
GPS tracker.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.228
All right, I'll go
get this to Mandy.

15:25.272 --> 15:27.187
Check the blind spots,
get a roving patrol.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.015
Check.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.152
Then keep trying,
work your sources.

15:36.196 --> 15:37.937
Find a way
to get through.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.199
Ma'am, we've resecured
the compound.

15:39.242 --> 15:40.417
Helos are ten minutes out.

15:40.461 --> 15:41.984
Nice work, but I may
need longer than that.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.725
Longer is not
an option.

15:43.768 --> 15:45.727
I tracked down a Hashid elder
that might have some influence.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.816
They're getting him
on the line.Tell me when you have him.

15:47.859 --> 15:49.296
You have to get
your people together.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.167
We got to evacuate.They're ready. I'm not.

15:51.211 --> 15:53.169
The Hashid tribe is mobilizing

15:53.213 --> 15:55.693
to assault any
remaining Bakil forces.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.521
That's good. We could
get our helos in then.

15:57.565 --> 16:00.133
Open war between these tribes
will bulldoze any hope of peace

16:00.176 --> 16:01.743
in this region
for generations.

16:01.786 --> 16:05.138
If I leave before getting
the Hashid to stand down,

16:05.181 --> 16:09.185
this devolves
into a bloodbath.

16:09.229 --> 16:12.275
Now that bloodbath
will be on my hands.

16:12.319 --> 16:14.234
Our country's hands.

16:14.277 --> 16:17.106
I can't leave until I've
completed my mission.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.195
I understand that,
but we got to roll.

16:19.239 --> 16:21.589
Don't have time.Hey, wait a minute.

16:21.632 --> 16:23.156
See, you're a lot like me.

16:23.199 --> 16:28.335
You could be riding a desk in
some air-conditioned op center

16:28.378 --> 16:30.641
instead of dodging
bullets at your age.

16:30.685 --> 16:34.210
So you understand exactly

16:34.254 --> 16:38.084
why I... can'tleave.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.175
Everyone's set.
Holding fast.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.525
Helos are eight mikes out.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.701
You got eight minutes.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.051
Come on.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.314
Let's go!
Come on!

16:55.101 --> 16:57.059
Yeah, sorry I didn't
clean off the blood.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.321
It's their blood, not ours.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.193
Doesn't bother me.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.325
Let's see what
our intruders were up to.

17:02.369 --> 17:05.198
They weren't inside long,
you know. We took 'em out fast.

17:06.721 --> 17:10.246
Cell phone sent one text
before we spotted them.

17:10.290 --> 17:13.162
Message went
to a dozen contacts.

17:13.206 --> 17:15.338
What does the
message say?

17:15.382 --> 17:16.905
It's a string of numbers.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.950
Well, they definitely
weren't playing Keno.

17:18.994 --> 17:21.083
GPS coordinates.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.389
They were tagging targets.

17:22.432 --> 17:25.131
They only sent one location.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.223
This building.

17:30.266 --> 17:33.313
We've got to get everybody
out of here.Got to move.

17:33.356 --> 17:35.097
Ma'am, the helos are inbound.
Two mikes.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.272
Bravo should have
a visual on them soon.

17:36.316 --> 17:37.882
Thank you, IT2. Sir?

17:37.926 --> 17:39.188
Come take a look at this.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.670
Sir, the enemy appears
to be prepping

17:42.713 --> 17:44.193
for a second-wave assault.

17:44.237 --> 17:45.499
I see it.

17:45.542 --> 17:48.676
Looks like they're setting up
mortar positions.

17:48.719 --> 17:52.158
The compound is not under fire,
the LZ is still clear.

17:52.201 --> 17:54.899
Well, you're looking at the
same picture I am, Ensign.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.379
The helos'll probably
make it in,

17:56.423 --> 17:57.946
but once those mortars
start dropping...

17:57.989 --> 18:00.688
Helos are gonna get torn up
along with everyone in 'em.

18:00.731 --> 18:02.168
Exactly.

18:02.211 --> 18:04.213
I need to wave 'em off.

18:06.694 --> 18:09.088
Orzet 1-8, this is Havoc Base.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.350
Be advised you have multiple

18:10.393 --> 18:12.178
enemy mortar positions
on target.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.223
This is a hot LZ.
Abort extract.

18:14.267 --> 18:15.877
I say again,
abort extract.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.227
Havoc Base, this is Orzet 1-8.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.229
We copy. Hot LZ. We are RTB.

18:20.273 --> 18:22.449
All right.
I'll call the boys.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.407
Sir, it was my call.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.279
I should tell them.

18:29.891 --> 18:31.849
Bravo 1, this is Havoc Base.

18:31.893 --> 18:33.416
Be advised

18:33.460 --> 18:34.678
you have major enemy activity

18:34.722 --> 18:36.332
surrounding
the diplomatic compound,

18:36.376 --> 18:38.682
including at least three
mortar positions.

18:38.726 --> 18:41.903
That's a good copy, Havoc.
How far out is the exfil?

18:41.946 --> 18:43.426
The helo extract
has been waved off.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.428
[groans]

18:45.472 --> 18:47.952
I say again, your helo
extract has been aborted.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.389
We can't bring 'em
into a hot LZ.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.740
Ah, that's a good copy, Havoc.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.618
Havoc, this is 1.

19:01.662 --> 19:03.359
They're dialing in
on the residence.

19:03.403 --> 19:05.318
We have to move everybody
to the south building.

19:05.361 --> 19:06.580
DAVIS:
Copy, 1.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.323
Move! Move.What happened
with the helicopters?

19:10.366 --> 19:11.454
Where are they?Move!

19:11.498 --> 19:13.717
[alarm sounding]Got to move. Let's go.

19:13.761 --> 19:15.328
Move! Move!
South building.

19:15.371 --> 19:17.417
Everyone in the back.
On your left.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.549
Move! Move! Move! Move!

19:19.593 --> 19:21.160
Move! Move! Move![alarm sounding]

19:21.203 --> 19:22.813
Move! Move!

19:28.079 --> 19:30.081
Everybody inside! Move!

19:32.649 --> 19:35.217
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

19:35.261 --> 19:37.350
[explosion]

19:37.393 --> 19:39.265
Stay with me, everyone!

19:39.308 --> 19:41.267
[explosion]

19:41.310 --> 19:43.573
Basement, get 'em to
the basement. Everybody.

19:43.617 --> 19:46.097
Everybody, stay with me!
Stay with me!

19:46.141 --> 19:47.490
[loud rumbling]

19:47.534 --> 19:49.318
Hey, what the
hell was that?

19:49.362 --> 19:51.364
I don't know,
let's go find out.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.891
[alarm continues sounding]

19:58.458 --> 20:01.809
VBID just ripped
this wall right open.Yeah, yeah.

20:01.852 --> 20:04.420
Take that guy out.

20:04.464 --> 20:05.769
Havoc this is 1.
They breached

20:05.813 --> 20:07.423
the outer compound.
We're gonna be overrun.

20:13.081 --> 20:15.301
[gunfire]

20:24.832 --> 20:26.616
RAY:
Soften us up with mortars, then
send a VBID through the wall.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.401
Somebody's out there
thinking, brother.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.316
Okay, tell you what.
We'll flank 'em. Hey.

20:30.359 --> 20:33.493
You guys stay here.
Clay, with me. Move.

20:33.536 --> 20:36.060
[gunfire]

20:46.680 --> 20:48.638
[men shouting]

20:48.682 --> 20:51.032
They're trying to take
that DShK.

20:51.075 --> 20:52.294
We got to keep them out there.

20:53.904 --> 20:56.080
I got an idea.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.519
Spense, hold! Stop!

21:14.664 --> 21:15.622
Damn it.

21:15.665 --> 21:18.189
[gunshots]

21:37.861 --> 21:39.254
[gasps]

21:48.698 --> 21:50.396
[gunfire stops]

22:00.623 --> 22:02.495
Spenser, move!

22:15.246 --> 22:16.683
Think we bought ourselves
a little time.

22:16.726 --> 22:18.293
Yeah, but tell you what,
you get an idea like that again,

22:18.337 --> 22:20.077
you come to me first,
you understand?

22:20.121 --> 22:22.341
Sounds good, boss.
Hey, you good?

22:22.384 --> 22:23.777
I'm fine.
You're limping.

22:23.820 --> 22:26.345
Overwatch, keep an eye
on the breech point.

22:34.527 --> 22:38.139
[indistinct radio chatter]

22:38.182 --> 22:40.141
Our guys ain't gonna
hold out much longer

22:40.184 --> 22:41.969
now that I called off
their lifeline.

22:42.012 --> 22:45.320
Yeah, well, look
at the residence.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.105
Helos would've
suffered the same fate.

22:48.149 --> 22:51.500
Then why do I feel like I just
left our team out to dry?

22:51.544 --> 22:53.284
'Cause you did.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.377
Feeling that way's better
than having two birds downed

22:58.420 --> 23:01.423
with everyone inside,
your team included.

23:01.467 --> 23:05.209
Bravo's still alive,
and they are fighting.

23:05.253 --> 23:07.647
We're gonna
get them out,

23:07.690 --> 23:11.477
but only if
you're at 100%.

23:13.479 --> 23:16.351
I'm there.
Let's bring them home.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.397
Let's bring them home.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.885
All right, listen up, hey.

23:28.929 --> 23:31.148
Suggestion box is open.
What do you think?

23:31.192 --> 23:33.455
I say we pull the pin
on this Atomic Blond

23:33.499 --> 23:34.804
and throw it over
the wall again.

23:34.848 --> 23:36.589
Sun's down,

23:36.632 --> 23:38.634
dark might let us try
the helo exfil again.

23:38.678 --> 23:40.419
We can't hold that long.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.464
When I was outside,
there was a bus

23:42.508 --> 23:43.857
parked about 50 feet
from the wall breach.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.467
Yeah, I don't know.
I say we avoid

23:45.511 --> 23:46.512
all transportation
right now.

23:46.555 --> 23:48.035
It's big enough,
it can fit everyone.

23:48.078 --> 23:49.645
JASON:
Does it run?

23:49.689 --> 23:51.473
There's no way I'm gonna run
a gauntlet with these people,

23:51.517 --> 23:52.953
so they end up sitting
in a bullet sponge.

23:52.996 --> 23:54.520
I saw it pull up right before
everything popped off.

23:54.563 --> 23:55.869
It'll run. Yep.You sure?

23:55.912 --> 23:57.523
We can't play
Alamo much longer.

23:57.566 --> 23:59.525
Next wave is gonna be
their hardest punch.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.918
Yeah.We got a secondary
vehicle still running.

24:01.962 --> 24:05.052
We use that to pull security
for the Partridge Family exfil.

24:05.095 --> 24:06.488
Sounds good. Okay.
Convoy it is. Let's go.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.621
All right, let's go.

24:08.664 --> 24:11.406
RAY:
Bravo 4,
how's it going up there?

24:11.450 --> 24:13.060
TRENT: Good for now.
They're still hanging back.

24:13.103 --> 24:14.583
All right, look, Sonny,

24:14.627 --> 24:16.455
you and I will get the SUV,
understand?

24:16.498 --> 24:18.457
And we'll drive
to the breached wall right here.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.806
You two, get everybody ready,

24:19.849 --> 24:21.503
and do not collapse
the roof position

24:21.547 --> 24:22.765
till you hear my cue.

24:22.809 --> 24:24.593
Sonny and I, we're gonna
lay down fire right here

24:24.637 --> 24:27.030
to clear a path to the bus.
You got it? Okay.

24:27.074 --> 24:28.597
Just about to make our move,
Ambassador.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.643
I still haven't connected with
the Hashid tribal leaders.

24:30.686 --> 24:33.384
From all reports,
they're mobilizing forces.

24:33.428 --> 24:36.953
Full-blown tribal war
will poison this entire area.

24:36.997 --> 24:39.565
You can call the Hashid
when we get to the embassy.It'll be too late by then.

24:39.608 --> 24:41.175
[exhales]Now, I came here to
put out this fire,

24:41.218 --> 24:42.481
not run from it.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.178
SONNY:
Ambassador,
you've done your best.

24:44.221 --> 24:45.875
Let us do ours now.

24:45.919 --> 24:48.530
There's a hardline phone on the
second floor of this building.

24:48.574 --> 24:52.621
I cannot leave without making
one more attempt to get through.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.493
The opposition's
gonna start lobbing mortars

24:54.536 --> 24:56.277
on this building.
We don't have time.

24:56.320 --> 24:59.628
Master Chief, if you're half
the leader I think you are,

24:59.672 --> 25:00.803
you know I can't
throw in the towel

25:00.847 --> 25:02.501
without firing my best shot.

25:02.544 --> 25:05.504
Jace, we got to go.

25:05.547 --> 25:07.767
MARSDEN:
I wouldn't ask
if this wasn't life and death.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.769
I need to use that phone.

25:09.812 --> 25:11.379
We don't have the time.

25:11.422 --> 25:13.512
CLAY:
Jason.

25:13.555 --> 25:14.774
If Ambassador Marsden believes

25:14.817 --> 25:16.166
that one phone call
can make a difference,

25:16.210 --> 25:18.560
that's good enough for me.
I'll go with her.

25:18.604 --> 25:22.042
Like I said, Clay,
ambition's a dirty word.

25:23.826 --> 25:25.785
Look, we'll go up, we'll
make the phone call.

25:25.828 --> 25:27.526
You guys get everybody ready.
We'll meet on the first deck.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.615
J...

25:29.658 --> 25:31.225
I'll go with them, too.

25:36.491 --> 25:37.971
Five minutes.

25:38.014 --> 25:40.016
Let's go.Thank you.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.588
Yes, sir. You have my word.

25:49.635 --> 25:51.724
Withhold your forces,

25:51.767 --> 25:53.639
and I will not leave
your borders

25:53.682 --> 25:56.598
until we've secured
the lasting peace

25:56.642 --> 25:58.557
your people deserve.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.559
I promise you that.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.387
Yes, sir.

26:03.431 --> 26:05.738
Yes, sir.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.263
Thank you.

26:09.306 --> 26:11.352
Thank you, sir.

26:11.395 --> 26:13.659
I will contact you
from the embassy

26:13.702 --> 26:15.356
as soon as I arrive.

26:15.399 --> 26:17.488
[panting]
Okay.

26:17.532 --> 26:19.447
They're standing down for now.

26:19.490 --> 26:21.101
Well done, ma'am.
Well done.

26:21.144 --> 26:23.538
CLAY:
I'd rather stare down
the bad end of an AK

26:23.582 --> 26:25.018
than have to make that call.

26:25.061 --> 26:26.628
You have balls of brass,
Ambassador.

26:26.672 --> 26:29.152
No matter how dark it gets,

26:29.196 --> 26:33.113
always have to convince yourself
you can see the light.

26:33.156 --> 26:35.332
RAY:
Well, ma'am, if you're done
working miracles,

26:35.376 --> 26:37.247
we need to get back downstairs.

26:37.291 --> 26:39.641
Now.Thank you for standing up
for me, Clay.

26:39.685 --> 26:41.904
Thank you, Senior Chief.

26:42.949 --> 26:45.299
You have changed the lives

26:45.342 --> 26:47.301
of the people
in this region.

26:47.344 --> 26:49.129
RAY:
Yeah, well, the people
outside shooting at us

26:49.172 --> 26:50.565
have a funny way of showing
their appreciation,

26:50.609 --> 26:52.872
so we do need to move.

26:52.915 --> 26:55.222
How's that
for vessel rocking?

26:59.356 --> 27:01.358
[Jason grunting]

27:04.231 --> 27:06.320
[rocket approaching]

27:16.678 --> 27:18.637
[tires screeching]

27:21.074 --> 27:23.206
Second floor. That's where
Clay and Ray were headed.

27:23.250 --> 27:24.643
Bravo 2, status?

27:26.732 --> 27:28.081
Come on, Ray.

27:28.124 --> 27:30.126
Bravo 6, status?

27:35.044 --> 27:36.524
CLAY: Ambassador, come on.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

27:36.567 --> 27:39.135
Stay with me, Ambassador.
[coughs]

27:39.179 --> 27:41.616
[explosion]Ambassador! You'll be okay.

27:44.314 --> 27:45.925
Her pulse is barely there.

27:45.968 --> 27:48.710
Got abdominal laceration,
neck laceration,

27:48.754 --> 27:50.886
compound rib fracture. Ray.

27:50.930 --> 27:54.150
Hey. She's bad.
She's bad. Damn it.

27:54.194 --> 27:56.239
Stay with me, you hear me?

27:56.283 --> 27:57.850
Ambassador, stay with me.

27:57.893 --> 27:59.155
JASON:
Bravo 2, radio check, over.

27:59.199 --> 28:00.287
You hear me? You're
gonna be all right.

28:00.330 --> 28:01.941
Bravo 1,
I hear you Lima Charlie.

28:01.984 --> 28:03.246
Athena's down.

28:03.290 --> 28:04.726
Trying to stabilize her now.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.946
JASON:
Copy all. Get outside ASAP.
We're moving.

28:06.989 --> 28:08.425
Check.Stay-stay with me. Ambassador.

28:08.469 --> 28:10.427
We got to move her outside.If we move her...

28:10.471 --> 28:12.168
We don't have a choice.

28:12.212 --> 28:14.170
All right.Let's go.

28:14.214 --> 28:17.652
[explosion]

28:17.696 --> 28:21.395
[gunfire in distance]

28:22.439 --> 28:23.876
SONNY:
Smoke out.

28:29.272 --> 28:30.839
JASON:
The only move we have.

28:30.883 --> 28:33.886
Bravo 2, heading your way.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.372
I thought the plan was to exit
through the breached wall.

28:42.416 --> 28:45.898
It is. Look.

28:50.424 --> 28:52.469
DAVIS:
A distraction.

28:52.513 --> 28:53.775
Draw the enemy,

28:53.819 --> 28:55.777
go out the back door.

29:01.043 --> 29:03.611
â™ª

29:20.149 --> 29:21.934
Smoke's working,
but they're wising up, boss.

29:21.977 --> 29:23.370
Let's see how wise
they are to this.

29:33.728 --> 29:35.948
Coming inside, coming inside.

29:44.565 --> 29:46.567
Stay. Stay here.

29:53.443 --> 29:54.923
Go, go, go, go, go!

30:02.409 --> 30:03.845
Go, go, go, go, go!

30:03.889 --> 30:05.804
Move, move, move!

30:06.805 --> 30:08.197
Oh!

30:11.026 --> 30:14.029
Clay! I got you! Move!

30:31.699 --> 30:34.571
You'll be all right, Ambassador.

30:34.615 --> 30:36.486
Easy. Easy.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.140
You'll be all right.

30:38.184 --> 30:39.446
All right,
anyone without a gun, get low,

30:39.489 --> 30:41.578
and stay out of the windows,
okay?

30:52.024 --> 30:53.547
JASON:
Havoc, this is 1.

30:53.590 --> 30:55.375
Hitting the road.
We could use your help.

30:55.418 --> 30:56.898
Best route to the airfield.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.465
ERIC:
Bravo 1,
this is Havoc Base.

30:58.508 --> 30:59.901
We read you,
Lima Charlie.

30:59.945 --> 31:02.861
Baker, widen out. Give
me a four-block radius.

31:04.993 --> 31:06.908
Bravo 1, I'm tracking
your position.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.954
Everything looks clear up ahead.

31:08.997 --> 31:11.304
Good copy.

31:18.441 --> 31:20.313
TECH:
Ma'am, we have
a trailing vehicle.

31:21.705 --> 31:24.491
DAVIS:
Damn it.

31:24.534 --> 31:26.058
Bravo 1, be advised,
you have what appears to be

31:26.101 --> 31:27.494
an enemy technical vehicle

31:27.537 --> 31:29.322
on course
to intercept your convoy.

31:34.936 --> 31:36.590
This isn't over.

31:41.421 --> 31:44.728
Enemy technical
is two blocks north,
moving fast in your direction.

31:44.772 --> 31:46.774
Advise you turn left
in 300 meters.

31:58.394 --> 32:01.963
â™ª

32:16.804 --> 32:18.327
They're not shaking 'em.

32:18.371 --> 32:20.112
Havoc to Bravo 1,
that enemy technical

32:20.155 --> 32:23.376
is approximately 100 meters
behind your trail vehicle.

32:45.615 --> 32:46.965
you got the lead.

Roger that.

32:59.194 --> 33:01.022

between us and them.

33:01.066 --> 33:02.676
Pick up your speed.Bravo 1,

33:02.719 --> 33:04.069
we're already
redlining up here.

33:04.112 --> 33:05.984
Can't push this thing
much harder, J.

They break down?

33:39.060 --> 33:41.454
Can't tell. They stopped
responding to my calls.

33:41.497 --> 33:45.066
Get Orzet 1-8 back
on the horn to stand by.

33:45.110 --> 33:46.676
We may still have
to fly 'em out of there.

You all right?

36:30.449 --> 36:32.190
I failed her.

36:34.279 --> 36:36.106
No, you didn't.

36:36.150 --> 36:37.238
You didn't fail her.

36:37.282 --> 36:39.284
Look, she stopped a war
from happening.

36:39.327 --> 36:40.502
That's
a good thing.

36:40.546 --> 36:44.071
She would want us to
celebrate her victory,

36:44.114 --> 36:46.116
not mourn her.

36:47.117 --> 36:48.728
Got it?

Yeah.

All right, let's do it.
Let's, uh...

39:35.285 --> 39:36.591
You know what,
we can...

39:36.635 --> 39:39.028
pour one out
for the ambassador.

39:39.072 --> 39:41.901
She was, uh...
she was different, wasn't she?

39:41.944 --> 39:43.468
They broke the mold

39:43.511 --> 39:45.470

39:45.513 --> 39:47.341

39:48.690 --> 39:51.389

kicker in her than politician.

39:51.432 --> 39:52.390

39:52.433 --> 39:54.087
Just, um...

39:54.130 --> 39:57.873
I wish there was more we
could do for her, you know?

39:57.917 --> 39:59.832
Me, too, brother.

39:59.875 --> 40:02.356
Me, too.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.924
Come on.
