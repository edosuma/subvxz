WEBVTT

00:00.736 --> 00:02.526
[in penguin voice]
And after the battle,

00:02.526 --> 00:04.566
they had all
the breakfast burritos

00:04.566 --> 00:06.566
-they could ever want!
-[Mariposa giggling]

00:06.566 --> 00:08.396
The end!

00:08.396 --> 00:09.646
[babbling]

00:09.646 --> 00:11.686
Okay. That's enough
goofing off.

00:11.686 --> 00:13.276
Time for bed.

00:13.276 --> 00:14.606
Good night, Meteora.

00:14.606 --> 00:16.316
[hisses] Goo!

00:16.316 --> 00:18.686
It's really great
you two get along so well.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.736
Good night, Mariposa.

00:21.736 --> 00:22.526
Sweet dreams.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.686
Marco.

00:27.686 --> 00:29.946
Hekapoo? What the heck
are you doing here?

00:29.946 --> 00:31.396
I need to talk
to you about the--

00:31.396 --> 00:33.396
Shh! Shh! Not in front
of the babies!

00:33.396 --> 00:35.646
Mariposa and Meteora
just fell asleep!

00:35.646 --> 00:37.566
What are you,
Eclipsa's baby-sitter?

00:37.566 --> 00:39.986
I am Eclipsa's
favorite baby-sitter,

00:39.986 --> 00:41.736
and I think it's nice
that she and Globgor

00:41.736 --> 00:43.776
are having a night out
after 300 years.

00:43.776 --> 00:45.316
Just listen, all right?

00:45.316 --> 00:46.606
I shouldn't even
be telling you this,

00:46.606 --> 00:48.486
but I have a feeling
some bad stuff

00:48.486 --> 00:50.186
is about to go down
on Mewni.

00:50.186 --> 00:51.486
Well, that sounds ominous.

00:51.486 --> 00:53.486
Okay, I know you like
to "get involved"

00:53.486 --> 00:55.606
because you "care,"

00:55.606 --> 00:56.816
but trust me.

00:56.816 --> 00:59.276
Stay. On. Earth.

00:59.276 --> 01:00.356
Ow.

01:02.066 --> 01:03.566
Stay on Earth.

01:04.776 --> 01:06.396
Uh.

01:06.396 --> 01:08.856
Star! Hekapoo just gave me
this really cryptic warning

01:08.856 --> 01:10.606
about bad things
happening on Mewni.

01:10.606 --> 01:12.066
Have you heard
anything about that?

01:12.066 --> 01:13.816
[spits]
Noooo...

01:13.816 --> 01:16.446
But we should probably
ask Eclipsa the-- Oh!

01:16.446 --> 01:18.356
I promised I'd send her
a picture of the babies
together!

01:18.356 --> 01:20.026
Quietly, they're asleep!

01:20.026 --> 01:21.606
Li'l baabieess!

01:21.606 --> 01:22.816
[both gasp]

01:22.816 --> 01:25.236
[Star]
Hekapoo left her portal open!

01:25.236 --> 01:26.736
Why's it so quiet?

01:28.736 --> 01:29.776
-[gasps]
-Oh, my gosh!

01:29.776 --> 01:31.276
[dramatic music]

01:31.276 --> 01:33.686
Do you think... ?

01:33.686 --> 01:35.856
Uh-huh. I think.

01:35.856 --> 01:37.486
Oh, no,
how long has it been?!

01:37.486 --> 01:39.106
I don't know!
Five minutes?! Ten?!

01:39.106 --> 01:41.106
They could be grandmas
by now! Let's go!

01:42.856 --> 01:44.686
[gulp]

01:44.686 --> 01:45.776
[both grunting]

01:45.776 --> 01:47.686
What happened here?

01:47.686 --> 01:49.276
[Marco] Who knows?

01:49.276 --> 01:51.066
It's been centuries
since we were last here.

01:51.066 --> 01:53.446
Oh, hot Marco, where
do we even start looking?

01:53.446 --> 01:55.106
[fairy squeals]

01:55.106 --> 01:56.316
-[rumbling]
-[Star whimpering]

01:56.316 --> 01:58.236
[zapping]

02:03.026 --> 02:06.236
Aaaah! Brunzettaaa!

02:06.236 --> 02:08.486
You look so cool! Duh!

02:08.486 --> 02:09.896
Did you miss me?

02:09.896 --> 02:12.236
I'm sorry,
who are you again?

02:12.236 --> 02:13.816
[clink]

02:13.816 --> 02:16.316
Brunzetta,
my sister is missing!

02:16.316 --> 02:18.276
Do you know anyone
that can help me find her?

02:18.276 --> 02:20.686
Hmmm. Old Irma.

02:20.686 --> 02:22.776
The sage who lives
just past that mountain range.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.856
We can get there
by midday if we leave now.

02:24.856 --> 02:27.686
Oh, uh, we'd love
to have you, Brunzetta,

02:27.686 --> 02:30.486
but this is kind
of a family affair.

02:30.486 --> 02:33.646
Wait, did you summon me
all the way out here

02:33.646 --> 02:35.276
just to ask for directions?

02:35.276 --> 02:37.646
No! I-- I also...

02:37.646 --> 02:39.396
One thing I...

02:39.396 --> 02:40.526
[panting]

02:40.526 --> 02:42.896
I value your friendship!

02:42.896 --> 02:43.686
Rude.

02:43.686 --> 02:45.356
[zap]

02:45.356 --> 02:48.066
Ugh! How could I be
so irresponsible?

02:48.066 --> 02:49.486
This is no place
for babies!

02:49.486 --> 02:50.486
[screech]

02:50.486 --> 02:51.736
-[screech]
-Yah!

02:51.736 --> 02:53.816
I'm a terrible brother.

02:53.816 --> 02:54.686
Cliff.

02:57.896 --> 02:59.606
[old crone voice]
Who's there?

03:04.686 --> 03:07.186
Old crone, we come
in search of two girls.

03:07.186 --> 03:09.856
One a half-monster
with clovers on her cheeks,

03:09.856 --> 03:12.776
the other a human girl
with a mole like this.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.066
Have you seen them?

03:14.066 --> 03:16.566
-[wind whistling]
-Who wants to know?

03:16.566 --> 03:18.486
I'm the mole-girl's
older brother,

03:18.486 --> 03:21.946
and she's the half-monster's
distant cousin,

03:21.946 --> 03:23.106
or-- or something.

03:29.066 --> 03:30.856
Hey, she knows magic!
Aaah!

03:30.856 --> 03:33.276
-Ooh!
-[evil cackling]

03:37.896 --> 03:39.646
[gasp]
Is that...

03:39.646 --> 03:40.816
a butterfly?

03:42.446 --> 03:43.896
Mariposa?

03:43.896 --> 03:46.946
Intruders!
Prepare to meet your demise!

03:46.946 --> 03:48.486
-Aah!
-Huh!

03:49.646 --> 03:50.816
Oof!

03:50.816 --> 03:53.146
Wait!
You're a magic user, too?

03:53.146 --> 03:55.186
Yeah?

03:59.146 --> 04:01.776
We don't see many
of your kind around here.

04:01.776 --> 04:03.236
[gasp] Meteora!

04:03.236 --> 04:04.736
What if they're
telling the truth?

04:04.736 --> 04:06.566
That guy and I
do have the same mole.

04:06.566 --> 04:09.186
Hmmm. I call
for a sister meeting.

04:09.186 --> 04:11.106
[whispering]

04:11.106 --> 04:13.356
Ugh! Fine!

04:13.356 --> 04:15.146
Greetings. I'm Bork.

04:15.146 --> 04:16.566
And this is Grobb.

04:16.566 --> 04:18.566
Those aren't
your real names.

04:18.566 --> 04:20.566
Please, allow us
to properly apologize

04:20.566 --> 04:22.606
by offering you some food.

04:22.606 --> 04:23.946
Our cave is this way.

04:23.946 --> 04:26.276
Food? Oh-ho!
Don't mind if I do!

04:27.986 --> 04:31.646
Uhh... can I help you?

04:31.646 --> 04:33.606
I don't know why,

04:33.606 --> 04:36.236
but something about you

04:36.236 --> 04:38.316
makes me angry!

04:38.316 --> 04:39.526
[uncomfortable laugh]

04:39.526 --> 04:40.606
Yeah.

04:41.856 --> 04:43.816
[Star] That was
some pretty sweet magic

04:43.816 --> 04:44.816
you used back there!

04:44.816 --> 04:46.526
Oh, thanks.

04:46.526 --> 04:47.856
The old women
of the mountain
found us as babies

04:47.856 --> 04:50.026
and taught me
all of their spells.

04:50.026 --> 04:50.856
Now that they've all died,

04:50.856 --> 04:52.026
it's my job to protect us,

04:52.026 --> 04:53.606
since Bork can't do magic.

04:54.986 --> 04:56.736
She can still
kick butt though!

04:56.736 --> 04:58.946
Like that time you wrestled
that giant mud-fly!

04:58.946 --> 05:00.646
I chopped off
all the legs

05:00.646 --> 05:02.356
and drained the putrid goo
from its body!

05:02.356 --> 05:03.946
And then it
kind of exploded.

05:03.946 --> 05:05.856
But I managed
to save the goo!

05:05.856 --> 05:09.146
[sighs] That was
the last good meal
we had that winter.

05:09.146 --> 05:12.446
Yeah, it's not easy surviving
in this dimension.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.026
Why did you
abandon us here?

05:14.026 --> 05:15.896
We didn't abandon you!

05:15.896 --> 05:17.186
We came as soon
as we could,

05:17.186 --> 05:19.066
but time works
differently here.

05:19.066 --> 05:20.236
We're here now though!

05:20.236 --> 05:21.736
You can
finally come home!

05:21.736 --> 05:23.646
Oh, yeah! Heh.

05:23.646 --> 05:25.736
I can't wait to see
what Earth is like!

05:25.736 --> 05:28.856
But first, soup's on!
Who's hungry?

05:28.856 --> 05:32.106
Oh oh oh! Me me me!
It's me! I'm hungry!

05:32.106 --> 05:34.446
What is this?

05:34.446 --> 05:37.066
[Teen Mariposa] Skin flakes
and garlic spider chow!

05:37.066 --> 05:38.356
[slurp]

05:38.356 --> 05:39.856
[swallows]

05:39.856 --> 05:41.396
Yummy.

05:41.396 --> 05:44.106
[gulping down soup]

05:44.106 --> 05:46.106
Ahhhh,
really takes me back!

05:46.106 --> 05:48.026
Though I always used
to add more garlic spiders.

05:48.026 --> 05:49.356
Ugh!

05:55.896 --> 05:57.896
Mmm. You sure
this will work?

05:57.896 --> 05:59.276
It better!

06:04.146 --> 06:06.776
[both panting]

06:07.816 --> 06:09.566
Uh, so heavy.

06:09.566 --> 06:12.946
Wyscan the Granter,
we summon you!

06:12.946 --> 06:16.026
[loud scraping, heavy thud]

06:20.356 --> 06:23.106
Come for a trade, girls?

06:23.106 --> 06:24.686
We captured
a magical creature.

06:24.686 --> 06:26.276
We'll give it to you
in exchange

06:26.276 --> 06:30.106
for giving me
magical powers,
just like Grobb.

06:30.106 --> 06:32.896
What an intriguing proposal.

06:32.896 --> 06:35.396
Very well.
Feed me the magic girl.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.146
Eww.

06:39.146 --> 06:40.646
Okey-dokey.

06:40.646 --> 06:42.106
Wait wait wait wait
wait wait.

06:42.106 --> 06:43.776
He's just gonna eat her?

06:43.776 --> 06:46.026
Well, yeah, seems
pretty straightforward.

06:46.026 --> 06:48.066
Magic girl goes in,
magic powers come out.

06:48.066 --> 06:49.986
Yeah, but I didn't think
it would be so,

06:49.986 --> 06:52.066
I don't know, creepy.

06:52.066 --> 06:54.566
Mariposa,
you don't need magic.

06:54.566 --> 06:57.026
You need to come home
with me!

06:57.026 --> 06:59.356
I'm not going
anywhere with you!

06:59.356 --> 07:00.816
You're not my brother!

07:00.816 --> 07:04.066
Even if I weren't,
this is wrong.

07:04.066 --> 07:05.566
I think you know that.

07:05.566 --> 07:08.026
Err! What's taking
so long over there?

07:10.026 --> 07:11.776
I've changed my mind.

07:11.776 --> 07:13.566
I thought we had a deal.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.686
And baby's hungry!

07:15.686 --> 07:18.566
[slurping]

07:18.566 --> 07:19.816
If you want the girl,

07:21.066 --> 07:23.066
you'll have to fight us
for her!

07:23.066 --> 07:25.026
Ugh, fiiiine.

07:25.026 --> 07:26.986
Come at me, or whatever.

07:26.986 --> 07:28.736
I got this!

07:28.736 --> 07:29.776
Haah!

07:30.776 --> 07:31.986
[stomach growling]

07:31.986 --> 07:34.606
-[slurp] [burp]
-Oops!

07:34.606 --> 07:36.356
Pardon my manners.

07:36.356 --> 07:38.946
-What?!
-I got it! Cupcake blast!

07:41.066 --> 07:43.486
Oooh! [chuckling]
Strawberry!

07:43.486 --> 07:45.356
Stop! He eats magic!

07:45.356 --> 07:48.106
We have to beat him
the old-fashioned way.

07:48.106 --> 07:50.066
Oh, the old-fashioned way,
hmm?

07:52.146 --> 07:53.986
Don't mind if I do!

07:53.986 --> 07:55.106
Let's go!

07:55.106 --> 07:56.066
Raaaaaaah!

07:56.066 --> 07:57.066
Mariposa!

07:57.066 --> 07:59.066
Hoo! Hah!
Hah hah hoo!

07:59.066 --> 08:00.316
Hah! Huh!

08:00.316 --> 08:01.316
Aaah!

08:01.316 --> 08:02.606
Oof! Hah!

08:02.606 --> 08:04.316
Ooh, you're fun!

08:04.316 --> 08:05.686
Raaah!

08:05.686 --> 08:08.896
[Marco grunting]

08:08.896 --> 08:11.066
You know, Bork actually
kicked my butt once.

08:11.066 --> 08:13.106
Yeah, Marco is
pretty tough, too.

08:13.106 --> 08:14.236
Yaah!

08:14.236 --> 08:15.026
[grunts]

08:15.026 --> 08:16.066
Ohh!

08:16.066 --> 08:18.146
Huh? Hey--

08:18.146 --> 08:19.106
[whispering]

08:19.106 --> 08:20.856
[Wyscan]
Oh oh oh ohh!

08:20.856 --> 08:22.486
Something you'd
like to share with the class?

08:22.486 --> 08:24.146
Don't keep me waiting, now.

08:25.186 --> 08:26.106
Hah!

08:26.106 --> 08:27.986
-Hey! Stand still!
-Hah!

08:27.986 --> 08:29.276
-[grunts]
-Now!

08:29.276 --> 08:30.146
Hope you
like garlic spiders!

08:30.146 --> 08:33.066
Uhh!

08:33.066 --> 08:34.026
Oop!

08:34.026 --> 08:36.446
[heaving sounds]

08:37.486 --> 08:40.396
[laughing]

08:40.396 --> 08:42.106
I actually
rather like garlic.

08:44.106 --> 08:47.066
Spiders, on the other hand,
ruin everything.

08:47.066 --> 08:51.236
Ugh, take your Magic Girl
and go, you awful children.

08:51.236 --> 08:53.686
[whimpering]
They're still crawling! Why?!

08:53.686 --> 08:55.236
[slam]

08:56.486 --> 08:58.146
-Yeah!
-Yeah-heh-heh-heh!

08:58.146 --> 08:59.396
Not bad, dude!

08:59.396 --> 09:00.816
Not bad yourself, sis!

09:00.816 --> 09:02.686
Watch it! You may be
a good fighter,

09:02.686 --> 09:05.066
but you're
still not my brother.

09:05.066 --> 09:07.236
What's... what's
that on your necklace?

09:07.236 --> 09:08.486
Huh?

09:08.486 --> 09:10.026
Hey!

09:10.026 --> 09:12.026
[in penguin voice]
And after the battle,

09:12.026 --> 09:13.606
they had all
the breakfast burritos

09:13.606 --> 09:15.686
-they could ever want!
-They could ever want!

09:15.686 --> 09:19.106
[gasp]
You are my brother!

09:19.106 --> 09:20.946
Come home, Mariposa.

09:20.946 --> 09:22.446
We can be
a family again.

09:22.446 --> 09:23.446
A family?

09:23.446 --> 09:24.896
Wait, wait, wait.

09:24.896 --> 09:26.856
Does this mean we'll
turn back into babies?

09:26.856 --> 09:28.316
Well, yeah.

09:28.316 --> 09:30.316
But you'll have
loving parents,

09:30.316 --> 09:32.146
a safe home to grow up in.

09:32.146 --> 09:34.526
And, Grobb! You get
to live in a castle

09:34.526 --> 09:38.236
with servants
and a weird knight
who does all your laundry!

09:38.236 --> 09:40.986
But we don't need a castle.

09:40.986 --> 09:42.276
And I already have a home.

09:42.276 --> 09:43.986
Grobb and I have
built a life together,

09:43.986 --> 09:45.646
and I don't want
to lose that.

09:45.646 --> 09:47.776
Yeah. Thanks for coming
out here and all,

09:47.776 --> 09:50.106
but I think
we're gonna pass.

09:52.106 --> 09:54.146
Marco, what are we gonna do?

09:54.146 --> 09:56.816
I... I don't know.

09:59.186 --> 10:01.186
What about food?

10:01.186 --> 10:02.186
-Huh?!
-Huh?!

10:02.186 --> 10:04.736
We, uh, got
all kinds of food.

10:04.736 --> 10:07.606
You got, like,
different flavors of spiders?

10:07.606 --> 10:09.606
You don't have to eat
spiders where we're going!

10:09.606 --> 10:11.356
You can eat waffles,
nachos, sushi...

10:11.356 --> 10:12.986
If you wanted to,

10:12.986 --> 10:15.276
you could eat
breakfast burritos all day!

10:15.276 --> 10:18.106
Wait a minute,
breakfast burritos are food?

10:18.106 --> 10:19.526
If you come home with us,

10:19.526 --> 10:21.486
you'll have all the food
you could ever dream of!

10:21.486 --> 10:22.646
-Oh-ho!
-[gasps]

10:24.146 --> 10:26.686
Will we get to grow up
together again?

10:26.686 --> 10:28.146
We'll make sure of it.

10:30.356 --> 10:31.816
Let's go home.

10:31.816 --> 10:34.186
[Marco, whispering]
Good night, Meteora.

10:34.186 --> 10:35.776
Good night, Mariposa.
