00:19.086 --> 00:22.673
Now, children,
are you sitting comfortably?

00:23.549 --> 00:24.633
Then I'll begin.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.763
This story started many
thousands of years ago,

00:30.139 --> 00:32.683
but it was all over
in just seven days.

00:33.350 --> 00:37.061
All that long, long time ago,
none of the things we can see now...

00:37.603 --> 00:42.233
the sun, the moon, the stars,
the earth, the animals and plants...

00:42.442 --> 00:44.402
not a single one existed.

00:44.652 --> 00:48.823
Only God existed, and so
only He could have created them.

00:49.323 --> 00:50.491
And He did.

03:00.451 --> 03:04.871
Mr. Simpson. What a character!
I wonder whatever became of him?

03:05.872 --> 03:08.207
Oh, I imagine he's dead,
like all the rest.

03:08.666 --> 03:10.668
Ah, those were the days.

03:20.344 --> 03:22.388
Mr. Tuttle, your hair!

03:30.438 --> 03:31.230
Yes?

03:31.731 --> 03:34.524
Good morning, ma'am.
We've come about the...

03:34.733 --> 03:36.651
Oh yes, of course.

03:38.653 --> 03:39.446
Come in.

03:41.990 --> 03:44.117
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

03:51.541 --> 03:52.375
You are?

03:52.918 --> 03:56.713
I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am.
And this is Edmund Tuttle.

03:56.922 --> 03:58.381
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

03:58.632 --> 03:59.925
You must be the gardener.

04:00.717 --> 04:02.301
Ay, that's right, the gardener.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.930
And this young lady's called Lydia.

04:07.139 --> 04:09.100
Have you had
much experience in service?

04:09.850 --> 04:14.146
Oh, don't let that angel face fool
you. She's older than she looks.

04:15.022 --> 04:15.898
Can you iron?

04:18.858 --> 04:20.569
What's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue?

04:21.821 --> 04:24.448
Ah, she can't talk, ma'am.

04:25.199 --> 04:26.617
The poor little mite's a mute.

04:28.327 --> 04:29.245
Oh, but she's a good little

04:29.453 --> 04:30.955
worker, I can promise you that.

04:32.247 --> 04:34.541
All right. All right.

04:34.749 --> 04:37.335
The other girl I had spoke
too much anyway. Follow me.

04:37.794 --> 04:41.381
You and the girl will sleep in the
attic room at the top of the stairs.

04:42.257 --> 04:45.176
- And you, Mr...
- Tuttle, ma'am.

04:45.427 --> 04:48.930
Ah, Tuttle. Ah, you can sleep
in the shed, around the back.

04:50.849 --> 04:52.350
As you can see,
the housework has been rather

04:52.600 --> 04:55.645
neglected since the servants
disappeared, almost a week ago.

04:56.396 --> 04:57.897
You mean they just vanished?

04:58.356 --> 05:00.608
Into thin air.
No notice, nothing.

05:01.443 --> 05:05.446
They didn't even collect their
wages. They... they just left us.

05:05.988 --> 05:07.823
What a strange thing to do!

05:08.907 --> 05:12.745
There are times when this house
is not exactly an ideal home.

05:13.996 --> 05:18.751
Hence my advertisement in the paper
for honest, hardworking people.

05:19.168 --> 05:23.213
There's nobody more honest or
hardworking that us, eh, Mr. Tuttle?

05:23.422 --> 05:24.631
Oh, ay, we're very honest.

05:25.299 --> 05:28.469
And uhm... very hardworking.

05:31.804 --> 05:32.889
The kitchen.

05:34.015 --> 05:37.810
I have breakfast at eight,
the children at nine,

05:38.478 --> 05:40.897
lunch will be served at one
and dinner at half past seven.

05:41.105 --> 05:41.981
And the master, ma'am?

05:46.069 --> 05:50.031
The master went off to war
a year and a half ago.

05:51.157 --> 05:53.743
I've had no news
since the war ended.

05:54.660 --> 05:55.828
Which of you does the cooking?

05:56.454 --> 05:57.789
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

05:58.623 --> 05:59.916
Which of you does the cooking?

06:00.833 --> 06:02.250
You all notice what I'm doing?

06:03.210 --> 06:04.211
In this house,

06:04.920 --> 06:08.173
no door must be opened without
the previous one being closed first.

06:08.340 --> 06:10.467
It is vital
that you remember this.

06:11.218 --> 06:14.346
It is not as easy as it may seem.
There are fifteen different keys

06:14.554 --> 06:18.558
for all of the fifty doors,
depending on the area of the house.

06:19.893 --> 06:24.314
Mrs. Mills, from tomorrow I'll
be leaving a set in your charge.

06:25.273 --> 06:26.108
Yes, ma'am.

06:27.067 --> 06:28.151
The music room.

06:28.610 --> 06:31.529
That old piano was already here
when we moved in. Please do not

06:31.737 --> 06:33.781
let the children
thump away on it.

06:34.907 --> 06:36.450
It sets off my migraine.

06:36.659 --> 06:40.496
Silence is something that
we prize very highly in this house.

06:41.414 --> 06:43.082
That is why
you will not find a telephone,

06:43.290 --> 06:45.960
a radio or anything else
that makes a racket.

06:47.086 --> 06:48.421
Ah... we don't have
electricity either.

06:49.004 --> 06:52.716
The Germans kept cutting it off, so
we just learned to live without it.

06:52.883 --> 06:54.009
- Let's continue.
- Ma'am,

06:54.218 --> 06:56.220
there's really no need to show us
around the whole house, we...

06:56.429 --> 06:57.346
Yes!

06:58.264 --> 06:59.432
Yes, there is.

07:00.849 --> 07:03.143
Because here, most of the time,
you can hardly see your way.

07:03.309 --> 07:05.103
It's often difficult
to make out if there is a table,

07:05.311 --> 07:07.772
a chair, a door, a sideboard...

07:09.399 --> 07:11.943
or one of my children
playing hide-and-seek.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.279
What do you mean, ma'am?

07:16.489 --> 07:18.575
Perhaps I should introduce
you to the children.

07:24.873 --> 07:28.084
Mr. Tuttle, see to the garden now.
You'll find tools in the shed.

07:28.293 --> 07:29.294
Yes, ma'am.

07:29.919 --> 07:31.795
You two can start
closing the curtains.

07:32.796 --> 07:33.756
All of them.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.119
Come.

08:16.881 --> 08:18.633
I'll wake them.
You wait here.

08:20.301 --> 08:22.136
Whatever you do,
don't open the curtains.

08:25.807 --> 08:27.016
Wakey-wakey.

08:30.602 --> 08:34.815
Now, come on,
eyes closed, hands together.

08:36.357 --> 08:40.278
Blessed be, at light of day,
Jesus, to whom now I pray.

08:40.486 --> 08:45.200
Blessed be the Virgin pure
whom I greet with faith so sure.

08:45.409 --> 08:50.330
Jesus, Mary, Spotless Rose,
keep us till this day doth close.

08:56.420 --> 08:59.506
- They're still half-asleep.
- What sweet little

08:59.714 --> 09:00.881
children!

09:02.091 --> 09:04.969
Well? What do you say?

09:05.845 --> 09:07.012
How do you do?

09:08.222 --> 09:09.014
How do you do?

09:10.349 --> 09:12.226
How do you, children?

09:12.893 --> 09:16.397
My name's Mrs. Mills,
but you can call me Bertha

09:16.605 --> 09:19.233
if you like.
What are your names?

09:19.942 --> 09:20.818
Anne.

09:20.985 --> 09:22.153
Nicholas.

09:22.403 --> 09:25.573
Anne and Nicholas.
What pretty names!

09:26.949 --> 09:28.909
Are you going
to be our new nanny?

09:33.079 --> 09:35.999
Yes, my dears,
I'm your new nanny.

09:36.291 --> 09:38.501
It's time for their breakfast.
Lydia, go

09:38.793 --> 09:40.587
to the kitchen
and close every shutter.

09:47.635 --> 09:50.138
The doctors were never
able to find a cure.

09:50.305 --> 09:51.264
For what?

09:52.348 --> 09:53.433
Their condition.

09:55.101 --> 09:57.937
The children have
a very serious allergy to light.

09:58.980 --> 10:01.899
They are photosensitive and they
must never be exposed to any light

10:02.149 --> 10:03.400
much stronger than this.

10:04.401 --> 10:08.322
Otherwise in minutes they would
break out in sores and blisters

10:09.364 --> 10:12.618
and begin to suffocate.
It would eventually be fatal.

10:12.826 --> 10:13.911
Good heavens!

10:16.455 --> 10:19.500
- I don't like this toast.
- Oh, why not?

10:19.708 --> 10:23.379
It tastes funny.
I liked it better before.

10:23.629 --> 10:27.424
Well, that's because,
before, somebody else made it.

10:28.675 --> 10:30.259
When are they coming back?

10:32.762 --> 10:33.846
They're not coming back, child.

10:34.889 --> 10:36.307
Just like daddy.

10:37.266 --> 10:39.352
Daddy is coming back, though.

10:40.228 --> 10:43.564
Mrs. Mills, our father is fighting
in a war in France, you know.

10:43.773 --> 10:44.982
It's the World War.

10:45.149 --> 10:46.859
I know, but he's in France.

10:47.068 --> 10:50.154
That's enough, chatterboxes.
Finish up your breakfasts.

10:51.823 --> 10:53.324
Are you going to leave us too?

10:55.660 --> 10:57.036
Of course not.

10:58.454 --> 10:59.913
Why should I leave you?

11:00.414 --> 11:04.167
The others said they wouldn't
but they did. And then it happened.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.169
Be quiet!

11:08.463 --> 11:10.716
What do you mean, Anne?
What happened?

11:13.969 --> 11:15.429
Mummy went...

11:16.221 --> 11:17.139
mad.

11:17.347 --> 11:19.766
- Nothing happened.
- Yes, it did.

11:19.975 --> 11:20.684
No, it didn't!

11:20.892 --> 11:21.727
Yes, it did!

11:21.935 --> 11:22.894
Be quiet!

11:25.939 --> 11:27.441
What's going on?

11:28.024 --> 11:28.816
I want to see those plates

11:29.024 --> 11:31.318
empty in less than a minute.
Is that clear?

11:34.947 --> 11:36.741
Mrs. Mills, would you
come outside a moment?

11:37.199 --> 11:38.743
I'd like a word with you.

11:40.995 --> 11:42.079
Yes, ma'am.

11:46.542 --> 11:48.836
The postman usually
comes every Wednesday,

11:50.296 --> 11:53.049
but I've just checked the letter box
and this week he hasn't.

11:54.675 --> 11:55.760
I'm afraid I don't follow, ma'am.

11:56.510 --> 11:58.386
This letter should have been
collected and delivered

11:58.595 --> 12:00.388
to the newspaper five days ago.

12:00.638 --> 12:02.682
It's an advertisement for servants.
Since it was never

12:02.891 --> 12:04.893
published, would you mind
explaining to me what you're

12:05.101 --> 12:06.603
doing here?

12:06.770 --> 12:08.146
Now I understand.

12:09.105 --> 12:12.067
Well, ma'am, that's exactly what
I was going to say to you when you

12:12.275 --> 12:13.526
opened the door to us.

12:13.860 --> 12:15.278
The truth is that

12:15.528 --> 12:17.822
we just come by
on the off-chance.

12:18.948 --> 12:22.160
A big house like this is always in
need of someone who knows the ropes.

12:23.119 --> 12:25.413
You mean you've served
in a house like this one before?

12:25.955 --> 12:28.332
This may come as a surprise
to you, ma'am, but...

12:30.084 --> 12:32.044
We, in fact,
used to work here.

12:33.670 --> 12:34.463
Here?

12:35.339 --> 12:37.758
Oh, now, it was a few years ago.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.720
And if you don't mind
my saying so, ma'am,

12:42.888 --> 12:44.890
they were the best years
of my life.

12:46.517 --> 12:48.477
That's why we come by,
because this house

12:49.520 --> 12:50.938
means a lot to us.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.483
Perhaps I'd best show you
our references, ma'am.

12:54.650 --> 12:56.944
No, no, no.
Don't bother, there's no need.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.195
Ah, so you say
you know the house well?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.864
Like the back of my hand.

13:02.073 --> 13:05.284
Well, that is always assuming that
the walls haven't sprouted legs

13:05.535 --> 13:07.328
and moved in the meantime.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.622
The only thing that
moves here is the light.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.961
But it changes everything.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.218
It's rather difficult,
to say the least.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.138
One might almost say...

13:26.347 --> 13:27.514
unbearable.

13:30.225 --> 13:33.145
The only way of enduring it
is by keeping a cool head.

13:34.354 --> 13:35.772
Oh, yes, ma'am.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.066
I don't like fantasies.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.569
Strange ideas,
do you know what I mean?

13:41.945 --> 13:44.114
I think so, ma'am.

13:44.281 --> 13:46.533
My children sometimes
have strange ideas.

13:48.910 --> 13:50.871
But you mustn't pay
any attention to them.

13:51.955 --> 13:53.540
Children will be children.

13:54.666 --> 13:56.334
Yes, of course, ma'am.

13:57.168 --> 13:58.377
All right,

14:00.463 --> 14:01.672
you can stay.

14:03.340 --> 14:05.051
Thank you very much, ma'am.

14:17.313 --> 14:19.065
It did happen.

14:29.449 --> 14:33.078
"The Roman governor tried to make
them change their minds afterwards."

14:33.620 --> 14:35.747
"To make them change
their minds," full stop.

14:36.664 --> 14:37.999
- "Afterwards...
- "Afterwards."

14:38.750 --> 14:40.126
"...he ordered them to be beaten.

14:40.335 --> 14:42.379
But Justus and Pastor,

14:42.587 --> 14:44.214
far from being afraid,

14:44.381 --> 14:45.632
rejoiced and showed
themselves willing

14:45.840 --> 14:47.592
to die for Christ.
When he

14:47.801 --> 14:50.387
saw this, the Roman governor
was filled with rage

14:50.595 --> 14:52.055
and ordered their heads
to be cut off."

14:57.643 --> 14:59.103
What do you find so amusing?

15:01.688 --> 15:02.648
Well...

15:03.190 --> 15:05.317
- Well, what?
- Those children

15:05.526 --> 15:07.069
were really stupid.

15:08.153 --> 15:09.279
- Why?
- Because

15:09.488 --> 15:13.033
they said they only believed in
Jesus and then got killed for it.

15:13.492 --> 15:14.576
And what would you

15:14.827 --> 15:17.287
- have done, deny Christ?
- Well, yes.

15:18.038 --> 15:19.873
Inside, I would have
believed in him.

15:20.249 --> 15:22.251
But I wouldn't have told
the Romans that.

15:25.337 --> 15:27.130
Is that what
you think too, Nicholas?

15:31.217 --> 15:32.510
I see.

15:33.845 --> 15:37.014
So you both would have lied
to the point of denying Christ.

15:37.265 --> 15:40.476
Oh, you'd have saved your heads
being chopped off by the Romans...

15:41.561 --> 15:44.397
- But what would have happened after?
- When?

15:45.189 --> 15:46.607
In the next life,

15:47.400 --> 15:48.901
the one that's waiting
for us after

15:49.110 --> 15:50.737
we die?
Where would you have gone?

15:52.780 --> 15:53.614
Where, Nicholas?

15:53.823 --> 15:56.199
- To the children's Limbo.
- What is

15:56.366 --> 15:58.744
- the children's Limbo, Anne?
- One of the four Hells.

15:59.453 --> 16:00.245
Which are?

16:04.499 --> 16:05.042
Me, me, me, me,

16:05.250 --> 16:05.917
me, me!

16:06.126 --> 16:08.295
No, no, no,
let him answer. Which are?

16:09.046 --> 16:11.381
There's the hell
where the damned go,

16:12.174 --> 16:13.341
then there's Purgatory...

16:14.009 --> 16:15.927
- Yes?
- And the Bosom of Abraham,

16:16.178 --> 16:18.263
where the Just go,
and Limbo, where children go.

16:18.430 --> 16:19.723
At the centre of the Earth.

16:20.057 --> 16:21.641
Where it's very, very hot.

16:22.893 --> 16:26.270
That's where children go who tell
lies, but not just for a few days.

16:26.479 --> 16:29.899
Oh, no.
No, they're damned.

16:30.524 --> 16:31.650
Forever.

16:32.443 --> 16:33.903
Think about it.

16:35.571 --> 16:36.864
Try to imagine

16:38.157 --> 16:39.825
the end of eternity.

16:40.368 --> 16:41.369
Close your eyes.

16:42.536 --> 16:44.372
Close your eyes
and try to imagine it.

16:46.207 --> 16:47.041
Forever.

16:49.543 --> 16:50.503
Pain.

16:51.712 --> 16:52.630
Forever.

16:54.256 --> 16:55.673
I'm getting dizzy.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.178
Now do you understand
why Justus and Pastor

17:00.345 --> 17:01.513
told the truth?

17:06.059 --> 17:07.018
Right.

17:07.519 --> 17:10.939
Ah, open your readers
at Lesson 6.

17:11.146 --> 17:13.483
- Can we go and play?
- You most certainly cannot.

17:13.691 --> 17:17.153
First, you're going to read the
lesson and then learn it by heart.

17:17.779 --> 17:18.738
All of it?

17:18.988 --> 17:22.117
Anne, any more protests and there'll
be no playing for you at all today.

17:22.742 --> 17:23.492
In fact...

17:24.743 --> 17:26.453
I think you can study
in separate rooms.

17:26.662 --> 17:29.081
- No, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

17:29.331 --> 17:32.126
- We get scared if we're separated.
- You get scared?

17:32.376 --> 17:34.086
As if you weren't used
to this house by now.

17:34.336 --> 17:35.963
What if we see a ghost?

17:36.839 --> 17:39.174
Has your sister been
telling you one of her stories?

17:39.425 --> 17:40.884
I haven't told him anything.

17:41.093 --> 17:42.970
Well, if you see a ghost,
you say hello and you continue

17:43.178 --> 17:44.930
on studying. Anne, come
with me to the music room.

17:45.139 --> 17:46.140
Why me?

17:46.348 --> 17:48.058
Because I say so!
Now come on,

17:48.726 --> 17:49.810
take your book.

17:50.394 --> 17:53.397
Nicholas, I want to see that lesson
learned in less than an hour.

17:53.939 --> 17:55.773
- Mummy...
- What?

17:56.983 --> 17:58.067
Give me a kiss.

17:58.276 --> 18:01.029
"Give me a kiss,
give me a kiss..."

18:01.237 --> 18:02.989
Anne, wait for me outside.

18:03.489 --> 18:04.615
You know I can't.

18:07.368 --> 18:08.327
Over there.

18:11.247 --> 18:12.081
Mrs. Mills,

18:12.248 --> 18:17.045
close all the curtains. My daughter
is going to cross the living room.

18:17.628 --> 18:18.671
Yes, ma'am.

18:26.511 --> 18:27.512
All right, Anne.

18:30.849 --> 18:31.767
Darling...

18:33.977 --> 18:36.229
mummy can't be
with you all the time.

18:39.024 --> 18:41.109
You must learn
to be on your own.

18:43.820 --> 18:45.155
Where's your rosary?

18:49.493 --> 18:51.328
Whenever you feel afraid,

18:52.079 --> 18:56.207
I want you to squeeze it with all
your might and say an Our Father,

18:56.415 --> 18:58.459
and then your fear will go away.

18:58.667 --> 19:01.837
- It won't.
- Yes, yes, it will. Honestly.

19:03.756 --> 19:06.258
Don't you see that when
you do this, the Lord is with you?

19:08.177 --> 19:10.137
There's no reason to be afraid.

19:50.009 --> 19:51.720
"The house and the family.

19:52.637 --> 19:55.180
We all live in
a house with our family.

19:55.848 --> 19:58.684
The family is usually
made up of parents,

19:58.934 --> 20:01.395
children and their grandparents.

20:01.562 --> 20:03.230
We must be obedient..."

20:03.439 --> 20:06.650
"...and kind towards
the other members of our family

20:07.026 --> 20:11.071
and we must never argue or fight
with our brothers and sisters..."

20:12.740 --> 20:13.991
Do you have any children?

20:14.158 --> 20:14.783
No.

20:15.367 --> 20:16.285
Mr. Tuttle

20:16.493 --> 20:19.246
and the girl, Lydia,
are all I've got.

20:19.455 --> 20:22.916
- And I'm all they've got.
- Was she born like that?

20:23.750 --> 20:24.751
Beg your pardon, ma'am?

20:25.793 --> 20:26.836
The girl.

20:27.587 --> 20:28.755
Was she born a mute?

20:29.881 --> 20:30.757
No.

20:32.842 --> 20:36.387
You know, I think I've finished
here, ma'am. If you'll excuse me,

20:36.596 --> 20:39.515
I think I'll go and see
if Mr. Tuttle needs a hand.

21:10.170 --> 21:10.921
Nicholas!

21:16.385 --> 21:17.636
Nicholas, I'm coming!

21:25.267 --> 21:27.144
- Nicholas?
- What's the matter?

21:27.353 --> 21:30.356
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't crying. I was reading.

21:31.315 --> 21:32.858
But I just heard you...

21:33.401 --> 21:35.277
Anne!

21:42.410 --> 21:43.202
Anne!

21:45.538 --> 21:46.622
Anne?

21:47.331 --> 21:49.458
I haven't learned it yet, mummy.

21:49.625 --> 21:51.585
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

21:53.086 --> 21:55.463
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't crying.

21:56.381 --> 21:58.133
But I just heard you
a moment ago.

22:00.093 --> 22:01.761
There's no need
to feel ashamed, darling.

22:01.970 --> 22:05.557
I don't.
If I'd been crying, I'd tell you.

22:05.724 --> 22:06.891
Oh, really?
So I imagined it, did I?

22:07.976 --> 22:09.686
No. It was that boy.

22:10.812 --> 22:11.688
What boy?

22:12.731 --> 22:13.565
Victor.

22:15.025 --> 22:15.900
Who's Victor?

22:17.152 --> 22:18.570
The boy who was
here a moment ago.

22:19.612 --> 22:22.698
I told him to let me study,
but he wouldn't stop crying.

22:23.657 --> 22:25.451
I think he's a spoilt brat.

22:25.784 --> 22:27.911
He said we had
to leave the house.

22:28.662 --> 22:29.496
Did he now?

22:30.414 --> 22:31.665
Why was he crying?

22:31.874 --> 22:34.960
Because he doesn't like
this house but he has to live here.

22:35.169 --> 22:36.336
His father's a pianist and...

22:36.545 --> 22:38.881
- Oh, his father's a pianist, is he?
- Yes.

22:39.381 --> 22:42.843
And I've told him he's not allowed
to touch the piano. He isn't, is he?

22:45.054 --> 22:47.014
So, you've spoken
to his father as well?

22:47.890 --> 22:50.976
No, only with Victor. His father
is with the others in the hall.

22:51.185 --> 22:53.227
But I've just come from the hall,
and there's no one there.

22:55.146 --> 22:57.982
They must have gone upstairs.
They're viewing the house.

22:58.232 --> 23:00.151
That'll do, Anne.
That's enough.

23:02.236 --> 23:03.154
Now, why were you crying?

23:03.363 --> 23:05.490
- It was Victor!
- So where is he now?

23:05.698 --> 23:07.116
- He went out through there.
- Would you

23:07.367 --> 23:11.079
mind telling me how a boy can get in
and out of this room if it's locked?

23:16.125 --> 23:18.127
I thought I made
myself quite clear!

23:19.545 --> 23:22.714
No door is to be opened without the
previous one being closed first.

23:22.881 --> 23:24.674
Is that so hard to understand?

23:25.467 --> 23:26.802
This house is like a ship.

23:27.010 --> 23:29.012
The light must be contained
as if it were water,

23:29.262 --> 23:31.348
by opening and closing the doors.

23:32.516 --> 23:34.768
- My children's lives are at stake!
- But, ma'am, I...

23:35.185 --> 23:36.895
Do not argue with me!
Be quiet!

23:38.146 --> 23:40.107
Now which was the last
of you to enter that room?

23:41.358 --> 23:42.275
Lydia?

23:45.153 --> 23:47.155
She hasn't got a key,
I already told you that.

23:47.781 --> 23:49.783
- Well, that leaves you, then.
- But I was

23:50.033 --> 23:52.493
in the hall the whole time.
And then I went out into the garden.

23:52.743 --> 23:53.744
You saw me with your own eyes.

23:54.036 --> 23:56.205
I hope you are not
suggesting that it was me!

23:57.832 --> 23:59.500
Do you think that I would
overlook such a thing

23:59.709 --> 24:01.585
and endanger the life
of my own daughter?

24:09.385 --> 24:11.637
You're not supposed
to read at the table.

24:12.722 --> 24:15.391
Oh, really?
Well, who is going to tell mummy?

24:15.808 --> 24:16.684
You?

24:19.729 --> 24:21.313
Or perhaps... you?

24:27.318 --> 24:28.278
Did you really see

24:28.486 --> 24:29.571
a boy?

24:30.530 --> 24:32.073
Yes, he's called Victor.

24:34.826 --> 24:37.287
- Is he a ghost?
- Don't be stupid.

24:37.495 --> 24:38.747
Ghosts aren't like that.

24:39.205 --> 24:40.749
What are they like?

24:41.249 --> 24:45.253
I've told you a thousand times.
They go about in white sheets

24:45.462 --> 24:47.297
- and carry chains.
- How do you know?

24:47.505 --> 24:50.425
Because I've seen them.
They come out at night.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.385
Fibber! Where?

25:00.559 --> 25:02.853
- You're stupid.
- Not half as much as you.

25:03.395 --> 25:05.105
Well, I don't believe
you saw that boy.

25:05.689 --> 25:08.650
Believe what you like. You'll soon
be begging us to play with you.

25:22.205 --> 25:23.998
Nicholas. Nicholas.

25:26.167 --> 25:27.085
What?

25:27.418 --> 25:29.128
Look.

25:30.213 --> 25:32.090
Why have you
opened the curtains?

25:32.298 --> 25:34.050
- It wasn't me.
- Who was it then?

25:34.509 --> 25:37.887
It was Victor.
He's been doing it all night.

25:39.430 --> 25:42.392
- Liar. I'm going to tell mummy.
- So I'm a liar, am I?

25:42.600 --> 25:43.559
Yes.

25:44.644 --> 25:48.481
Victor, come out behind that curtain
so my stupid brother can see you.

25:58.657 --> 26:01.952
- Leave me alone!
- You don't want to see him now, eh?

26:02.160 --> 26:05.372
You're a cowardly custard,
cowardly custard.

26:05.622 --> 26:07.207
Cowardly, cowardly custard.

26:09.626 --> 26:11.795
Well, I'll just have
to do it myself, then.

26:29.562 --> 26:31.022
That's enough, Victor!

26:34.275 --> 26:38.154
Nicholas, tell him to leave
the curtains alone. He won't listen

26:38.320 --> 26:40.948
- to me.
- Get off my bed, both of you!

26:41.198 --> 26:44.452
- This is our bed.
- No, it's mine.

26:44.869 --> 26:47.705
Anne, please stop
putting on that voice.

26:47.913 --> 26:49.707
You be quiet,
cowardly custard.

26:50.915 --> 26:55.045
Listen, if you don't stop, I'll call
my mother and she'll kick you out.

26:55.920 --> 26:59.215
- You don't know my mother!
- And you don't know my parents.

26:59.466 --> 27:01.301
Anne, I'm going
to tell mummy about you.

27:02.635 --> 27:04.429
Don't be stupid!
Can't you see it's not me?

27:05.889 --> 27:08.475
Victor, touch his cheek
so he knows you're real.

27:20.277 --> 27:22.237
Help! Mummy! Help!

27:22.488 --> 27:24.281
Help! Mummy!

27:24.490 --> 27:25.115
What is it?

27:25.324 --> 27:26.575
- Help!
- What is it?

27:28.285 --> 27:29.870
What? What is it?

27:30.079 --> 27:31.789
She was frightening me

27:31.997 --> 27:33.540
and I told her
to be quiet and...

27:33.749 --> 27:37.002
I'm fed up! Do you hear me?
I am fed up with you!

27:37.252 --> 27:39.421
I didn't do anything!

27:43.258 --> 27:47.763
"Therefore the Lord God sent him
forth from the garden of Eden,

27:48.263 --> 27:50.723
to till the ground
from whence he was taken.

27:50.932 --> 27:55.978
So he drove out the man and placed
at the east of the garden Cherubims

27:56.187 --> 27:58.606
and a flaming sword
which turned every way,

27:58.856 --> 28:00.733
to keep the way
of the tree of life."

28:01.526 --> 28:03.194
There! I've finished.

28:04.487 --> 28:06.114
Very good.

28:08.533 --> 28:11.285
Now you can ask
the Virgin for forgiveness.

28:11.953 --> 28:14.664
What!
That's not what we agreed.

28:14.914 --> 28:16.874
We didn't agree
anything, young lady.

28:17.083 --> 28:19.710
Today you're being punished
and you'll do as I say.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.795
You can't make me ask
the Virgin for forgiveness.

28:22.045 --> 28:23.213
How dare you?

28:23.422 --> 28:26.466
Mummy, I won't ask for forgiveness
for something I didn't do.

28:26.675 --> 28:28.635
You told your brother that there
was someone else in the room!

28:28.844 --> 28:30.137
- There was!
- You're lying!

28:30.345 --> 28:30.929
I am not!

28:33.473 --> 28:34.391
Anne.

28:35.517 --> 28:38.520
Anne, do you remember
the story about Justus and Pastor?

28:39.146 --> 28:40.605
Children who don't tell the truth

28:40.814 --> 28:41.982
end up in Limbo.

28:42.649 --> 28:43.692
That's what you say.

28:43.900 --> 28:47.696
But I read that Limbo is only for
children who haven't been baptised.

28:48.655 --> 28:50.781
And I have.

28:52.241 --> 28:55.411
"And Abraham took the wood
of the burnt offering

28:55.661 --> 29:00.374
and laid it upon Isaac, his son.
And he took the fire in his hand

29:00.958 --> 29:04.462
and the knife, and they went,
both of them together,

29:04.712 --> 29:08.007
and Isaac spake unto Abraham,
his father, and said,

29:08.215 --> 29:12.887
'My father.'And he said,
'Here I am, my son.'And he..."

29:28.651 --> 29:30.111
Did you look in on Nicholas?

29:30.445 --> 29:33.990
Yes, ma'am.
The little angel is fast asleep.

29:35.241 --> 29:37.369
What about Anne?
Is she still on the stairs?

29:38.870 --> 29:39.871
Oh yes, ma'am.

29:41.748 --> 29:42.791
I'd prefer to have her
where I can see her,

29:42.999 --> 29:45.669
but I can't embroider
in such poor light.

29:49.672 --> 29:51.715
How long is this punishment
going to go on? It's been

29:51.882 --> 29:52.883
three days now.

29:53.634 --> 29:54.718
It's up to her.

29:57.096 --> 30:00.099
She's got to learn to swallow
her pride and ask for forgiveness.

30:01.558 --> 30:03.811
Anyway, it's about time
she started to read the Bible.

30:05.020 --> 30:08.482
Well, the priest will be
very pleased to hear that, ma'am.

30:08.691 --> 30:10.401
If he ever deigns
to pay us another visit.

30:10.609 --> 30:12.945
He knows perfectly well
that the children can't go out.

30:13.153 --> 30:14.446
Oh, he told me
yesterday he'd be by,

30:14.655 --> 30:16.407
as soon as possible.

30:17.408 --> 30:20.201
I'm beginning to feel
totally cut off from the world.

30:22.245 --> 30:23.663
And this fog
doesn't exactly help.

30:23.871 --> 30:25.581
It's never lasted
this long before.

30:25.790 --> 30:27.417
Well, that's true, ma'am.

30:27.625 --> 30:28.918
Even the seagulls

30:29.127 --> 30:30.420
have gone quiet.

30:32.880 --> 30:33.673
Anne!

30:35.133 --> 30:36.801
Anne, I can't hear you!

30:37.677 --> 30:42.056
"And Isaac spake unto Abraham,
his father, and said, 'My father."'

30:42.223 --> 30:45.977
Incidentally, Mrs. Mills, I've had
to put up with Lydia running around

30:46.185 --> 30:48.146
above my head. She's been
hurtling backwards and forwards

30:48.353 --> 30:49.646
as if there were three of her.

30:50.439 --> 30:52.024
Would you kindly tell her
it's not necessary

30:52.232 --> 30:54.818
to kick up quite such a rumpus
just to do a little cleaning?

30:55.861 --> 30:59.156
- I couldn't bear another migraine.
- I'll tell her, ma'am.

31:00.490 --> 31:01.450
Thank you.

31:48.578 --> 31:51.665
Now she's really
gone too far. Lydia!

31:52.457 --> 31:53.333
Lydia!

32:13.144 --> 32:17.731
"...on the mount of the Lord
shall be seen. And the angel..."

32:17.940 --> 32:19.441
What's going on up there?

32:19.942 --> 32:21.694
Nothing, mummy, I'm just
reading like you told me.

32:22.736 --> 32:25.447
- Did you hear it as well?
- Hear what?

32:30.828 --> 32:31.954
"And the angel of the Lord

32:32.162 --> 32:36.542
called unto Abraham out of heaven
the second time, and said,

32:36.750 --> 32:39.253
'By myself have
I sworn, saith the Lord..."'

32:50.221 --> 32:51.180
What was that?

32:51.764 --> 32:52.682
I don't know.

32:53.725 --> 32:55.351
Anne, tell me
who's making that noise.

32:56.477 --> 32:57.979
I can't tell you, mummy.

32:58.938 --> 32:59.814
You tell me!

33:00.523 --> 33:03.693
I told you there was someone
in the room and you punished me.

33:03.901 --> 33:05.361
Now I don't know what to say!

33:05.570 --> 33:07.071
Anne, I want the truth!

33:09.282 --> 33:11.284
Tell me if there is
someone upstairs.

33:14.078 --> 33:15.830
There. In that junk room.

34:05.586 --> 34:07.505
Mummy, you're letting
the light in!

34:59.972 --> 35:01.306
She's here.

35:04.184 --> 35:06.687
Mummy, she says she's here.

35:08.147 --> 35:10.858
She's watching us.
She's watching us!

35:34.213 --> 35:35.423
Where did they go?

35:35.673 --> 35:37.759
They just came past here.
Didn't you see them?

35:37.967 --> 35:38.968
Which way did they go?

35:39.677 --> 35:41.763
Over there, over there,
oh, and down there, as well.

35:49.061 --> 35:51.188
They're everywhere.
They say this house is theirs.

35:52.939 --> 35:55.817
And they say they're going
to take the curtains down as well.

35:58.153 --> 36:00.781
- Ma'am, stay calm, please.
- I will not stay clam!

36:01.239 --> 36:02.574
For 5 whole years
during the occupation,

36:02.783 --> 36:05.285
I managed to avoid a single Nazi
ever stepping foot in this house!

36:05.494 --> 36:08.163
And now there is someone here,
under my nose, opening and closing

36:08.413 --> 36:11.375
- the doors.
- Ma'am, this is a very old house.

36:11.917 --> 36:14.169
Why, the floorboards squeak,
and the plumbing clanks, and...

36:14.419 --> 36:18.255
There were voices, I'm telling you.
A boy and 2 women talking together.

36:18.506 --> 36:19.715
Mummy, look!

36:22.760 --> 36:23.969
I did it yesterday.

36:24.845 --> 36:26.430
This is the father,
this is the mother,

36:26.639 --> 36:29.642
this is Victor
and this is the old woman.

36:29.892 --> 36:31.936
What do these numbers stand for?

36:32.144 --> 36:33.980
That's the number
of times I've seen them.

36:34.188 --> 36:36.482
I see the old woman the most.

36:41.153 --> 36:42.196
Oh, God in Heaven!

36:42.530 --> 36:43.406
Mrs. Mills,

36:43.614 --> 36:45.490
go and call Mr. Tuttle. Tell him
we have to search the whole house,

36:45.699 --> 36:47.117
immediately,
before it gets dark.

36:47.617 --> 36:48.952
Yes, ma'am.
There now.

36:49.202 --> 36:51.204
- Mummy...
- Yes, darling. It's all right,

36:51.746 --> 36:54.290
nothing's going to happen
to you while mummy's here.

36:54.874 --> 36:55.667
Look, mummy,

36:56.334 --> 36:57.585
she really scares me.

36:57.961 --> 36:59.087
It's as if she's
not looking at you,

36:59.337 --> 37:00.630
but she can see you.

37:00.922 --> 37:03.591
And she's always around,
saying, "Come with meee..."

37:03.800 --> 37:06.261
- Oh, Anne, don't lie to me.
- Honestly, mummy.

37:06.553 --> 37:08.179
And she asks me things.

37:08.430 --> 37:10.306
Victor told me she's a witch.

37:10.724 --> 37:11.850
What does she ask you?

37:12.350 --> 37:13.560
Things.

37:15.728 --> 37:17.771
Her breath smells.

37:21.692 --> 37:23.736
We have to open
all the curtains.

37:23.902 --> 37:25.446
I don't want any dark corners

37:25.612 --> 37:26.739
- where someone could hide.
- Yes, ma'am.

37:26.947 --> 37:29.450
You both search the right side
and I'll take the left.

37:29.658 --> 37:31.243
Then we'll search upstairs.

38:42.646 --> 38:46.315
Perhaps they are ghosts who lived
in this house before and who...

38:46.857 --> 38:49.276
Don't be stupid.
I've already told you

38:49.443 --> 38:51.862
ghosts go about in white sheets
and carry chains and go...

38:53.948 --> 38:54.740
Anne...

38:55.449 --> 38:57.410
why do you
make up such stories?

38:57.618 --> 38:59.704
I don't.
I read them in books.

38:59.912 --> 39:02.707
Well, you shouldn't believe
everything you read in books.

39:02.915 --> 39:04.542
That's what our mother says.

39:04.917 --> 39:07.753
She says that all this stuff
about ghosts is rubbish.

39:07.962 --> 39:11.132
And then she expects us
to believe everything written

39:11.340 --> 39:13.676
- in the Bible.
- And you don't believe it?

39:13.843 --> 39:14.926
I believe some things.

39:15.135 --> 39:19.764
But, for example, I don't believe
God made the world in seven days.

39:20.140 --> 39:23.935
And I don't believe that Noah got
all those animals into one boat.

39:24.311 --> 39:25.603
Or the Holy Spirit

39:25.770 --> 39:28.940
- is a dove.
- No, I don't believe that either.

39:29.149 --> 39:32.277
- Doves are anything but holy.
- They pooh on our windows.

39:38.199 --> 39:41.661
Have you mentioned
any of this to your mother?

40:47.516 --> 40:48.558
Ma'am?

40:49.518 --> 40:50.143
Yes?

40:51.979 --> 40:54.940
They've searched everywhere, ma'am.
There's no one.

40:55.649 --> 40:56.566
I see.

40:58.902 --> 41:00.237
Mrs. Mills?

41:02.030 --> 41:02.864
Yes, ma'am?

41:04.157 --> 41:06.326
Do you have any idea
what this might be?

41:08.328 --> 41:11.665
- Oh, it's a photograph album, ma'am.
- No, but look, they're all asleep.

41:12.457 --> 41:13.249
Look.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.084
They're not asleep, ma'am.

41:15.292 --> 41:16.293
They're dead.

41:18.796 --> 41:20.089
It's a book of the dead.

41:20.297 --> 41:23.926
In the last century, I believe they
used to take photographs of the dead

41:24.176 --> 41:25.761
in the hope that their souls

41:25.928 --> 41:28.639
would go on living
through the portraits.

41:31.684 --> 41:33.519
There are even group portraits.

41:35.563 --> 41:36.647
And children!

41:37.690 --> 41:39.025
It's macabre.

41:41.444 --> 41:43.820
How could these people
be so superstitious?

41:44.988 --> 41:46.573
Grief over the death
of a loved one

41:46.823 --> 41:50.201
can lead people
to do the strangest things.

41:53.913 --> 41:56.791
Get rid of it.
I don't want it in the house.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.043
Yes, ma'am.

42:11.348 --> 42:13.807
Mrs. Mills, it's cold. Why don't you
come and sit by the fire?

42:26.820 --> 42:28.405
Thank you very much, ma'am.

42:29.865 --> 42:32.618
So, tell me about
when you worked here before.

42:33.452 --> 42:35.120
Did you have to look
after children then as well?

42:35.788 --> 42:39.124
No, I was in charge
of organising the housework.

42:41.001 --> 42:42.251
Were there many servants?

42:43.211 --> 42:45.296
Oh, about fifteen.

42:46.673 --> 42:47.590
Though in the end

42:47.799 --> 42:49.634
there were just
the three of us left.

42:49.884 --> 42:50.677
Why?

42:51.386 --> 42:53.763
My employers moved to London.

42:54.305 --> 42:56.474
They came here less

42:56.724 --> 42:59.102
and less, it being so
out of the way like...

42:59.978 --> 43:04.023
And so gradually
the house just became empty.

43:05.608 --> 43:07.944
Everybody ends up
leaving this damned island.

43:10.071 --> 43:14.199
My family left in the summer
of 1940, just before the invasion.

43:16.118 --> 43:18.078
That was the last
I ever heard of them.

43:22.833 --> 43:24.668
I don't blame them.

43:26.128 --> 43:28.130
Actually, we left too.

43:30.007 --> 43:32.926
Although, you know sometimes
when you leave a place,

43:33.802 --> 43:36.096
it's like it's there with you

43:36.305 --> 43:37.848
all the time.

43:38.223 --> 43:40.767
I always felt like
I never left this house.

43:41.310 --> 43:42.393
Why did you leave?

43:43.811 --> 43:47.315
Oh, on account of the tuberculosis.
The whole area was evacuated.

43:51.986 --> 43:53.821
Was that when Lydia went dumb?

43:54.905 --> 43:56.699
Yes, I think so.

43:57.325 --> 44:00.244
Though you know,
my memory is a bit rusty

44:00.453 --> 44:02.621
- these days, ma'am.
- What happened to her?

44:08.586 --> 44:11.880
Well, suddenly,
one day, she just

44:13.673 --> 44:14.924
stopped talking.

44:15.383 --> 44:17.052
Well, there must
have been a reason.

44:18.303 --> 44:20.472
People don't just stop talking.

44:21.014 --> 44:24.309
These things are always
the result of some sort of trauma.

44:25.560 --> 44:27.395
Something must
have happened to her.

44:31.858 --> 44:34.569
- Did your employers treat her well?
- Oh, they were always

44:34.778 --> 44:38.073
very kind to us.
They treated us just like family.

44:41.034 --> 44:43.869
You know, ma'am,
I think I will go to bed.

44:44.370 --> 44:46.747
I'll never be able
to get up in the morning.

44:47.081 --> 44:48.123
Off you go.

44:49.041 --> 44:50.459
I'm going to stay
here a while longer.

44:51.335 --> 44:52.252
Yes, ma'am.

45:26.577 --> 45:28.871
I'm sorry I was
so hard on you.

45:36.838 --> 45:38.298
Can you forgive me?

45:44.636 --> 45:45.429
Anne.

46:05.240 --> 46:07.242
- Mummy.
- What?

46:08.243 --> 46:09.786
When's daddy coming home?

46:11.245 --> 46:12.788
When the war's over.

46:13.956 --> 46:16.542
Why did he go to war?
I mean,

46:16.751 --> 46:19.003
nobody's done
anything bad to us.

46:20.630 --> 46:21.756
Daddy went...

46:25.468 --> 46:27.595
Daddy went because
he's very brave,

46:29.430 --> 46:33.601
and because he wasn't prepared to
let the Germans tell him what to do.

46:34.769 --> 46:36.062
Why?

46:44.402 --> 46:45.612
Charles...

46:48.281 --> 46:49.449
Where are you?

49:37.696 --> 49:39.113
Mrs. Mills!

49:40.948 --> 49:42.324
Mrs. Mills!

49:43.617 --> 49:45.035
What's the matter, ma'am?

49:45.536 --> 49:48.664
The key to the music room!
Give it to me! Quickly!

49:48.914 --> 49:50.582
- What's happening?
- Come on!

50:00.509 --> 50:01.593
Oh, my God!

50:05.597 --> 50:07.391
I checked that room myself.

50:10.018 --> 50:11.185
It was empty.

50:12.103 --> 50:13.813
Now take these tablets, ma'am.

50:14.689 --> 50:16.065
They'll do you good.

50:16.232 --> 50:18.359
And yet I felt as if
there was someone else there.

50:21.154 --> 50:22.697
And it wasn't human.

50:23.656 --> 50:26.200
There is something in this house.

50:27.201 --> 50:28.911
Something diabolic.

50:29.162 --> 50:30.079
Ma'am...

50:30.455 --> 50:32.290
Something which is not...

50:35.251 --> 50:36.628
not at rest.

50:41.340 --> 50:42.716
I know you don't believe it.

50:44.092 --> 50:45.552
You don't believe it, do you?

50:46.386 --> 50:47.596
No, I don't blame you.

50:48.347 --> 50:50.891
I... I used to not
believe those things.

50:53.477 --> 50:55.187
I do believe it, ma'am.

50:58.607 --> 51:00.817
I've always believed
in those things.

51:01.526 --> 51:04.696
Oh, they're not easy
to explain, but they do happen.

51:05.906 --> 51:09.909
We've all heard
stories of the beyond,

51:10.660 --> 51:12.328
now and then.

51:13.704 --> 51:15.539
And I think that, sometimes,

51:16.791 --> 51:17.833
the world...

51:19.835 --> 51:23.381
of the dead gets
mixed up with the world

51:23.547 --> 51:24.590
of the living.

51:26.133 --> 51:29.762
But it's impossible! The Lord would
never allow such an aberration!

51:30.012 --> 51:33.599
The living and the dead, they will
only meet at the end of eternity.

51:36.519 --> 51:38.687
- It says so in the Bible.
- Ma'am,

51:40.939 --> 51:43.984
there isn't always
an answer for everything.

51:56.705 --> 51:58.290
Where are you off to, ma'am?

51:58.832 --> 52:01.167
I'm going to the village
to pay Father Legrand a visit.

52:01.793 --> 52:04.546
If he won't come here, then I shall
go to him. And I'll bring him back.

52:04.754 --> 52:07.756
- Wait till the weather improves.
- I've waited long enough.

52:09.466 --> 52:11.260
Ma'am, the priest told me...

52:11.468 --> 52:15.306
I don't care what he told you!
I want him to tell me personally.

52:15.764 --> 52:17.016
He must come today.

52:17.224 --> 52:21.437
- What are you going to tell him?
- We've searched every room in there.

52:22.271 --> 52:24.064
And now I need them
to be blessed.

52:26.317 --> 52:29.111
Ma'am, please wait.
It's still very early.

52:29.320 --> 52:31.822
- Mr. Tuttle.
- Good morning, ma'am.

52:32.072 --> 52:34.908
I need you to search
the whole garden for gravestones.

52:35.159 --> 52:36.952
- Gravestones?
- When my husband bought this house,

52:37.201 --> 52:38.953
we were told there was
a little cemetery.

52:39.203 --> 52:41.581
I think it was somewhere
over there, amongst the trees.

52:41.748 --> 52:44.000
- I've not seen anything.
- Check carefully.

52:44.751 --> 52:46.836
- They could be overgrown.
- Yes, ma'am.

52:47.045 --> 52:49.422
I need to know if there was
a family buried here.

52:49.631 --> 52:51.883
And if they had
a little boy, Victor.

53:08.106 --> 53:10.275
Now she thinks
the house is haunted.

53:11.193 --> 53:13.362
Do you think it's safe
to let her go?

53:14.154 --> 53:16.865
Oh, don't worry.
The fog won't let her get very far.

53:17.074 --> 53:20.327
Oh, yes, the fog.
The fog... of course.

53:21.620 --> 53:25.540
And when do you think we should
bring all this out into the open?

53:26.541 --> 53:30.253
All in good time,
Mr. Tuttle, all in good time.

53:31.296 --> 53:32.881
Speaking of which...

55:27.659 --> 55:28.326
Charles!

55:30.286 --> 55:30.954
Grace.

55:44.800 --> 55:47.636
You're here!
You're here!

55:48.303 --> 55:50.722
They... they said
there was no hope.

55:51.640 --> 55:53.684
They said I should
give you up for dead.

55:54.643 --> 55:56.103
They say a lot of things.

56:01.900 --> 56:04.903
Thank you, thank you, God.

56:05.486 --> 56:06.696
Thank you.

56:07.571 --> 56:09.323
Every night
I've prayed for this.

56:10.574 --> 56:12.451
Begging God to bring you back.

56:14.662 --> 56:17.748
To bring the children
their father back. You're here.

56:21.002 --> 56:23.337
But where have you been
all this time?

56:24.755 --> 56:27.925
Out there,
looking for my home.

56:35.849 --> 56:37.684
You're so different.

56:39.060 --> 56:40.437
So different.

56:41.271 --> 56:43.106
Sometimes I bleed.

57:20.976 --> 57:21.810
Ma'am.

57:24.647 --> 57:25.648
Mrs. Mills,

57:28.567 --> 57:29.818
this is my husband.

57:33.697 --> 57:36.240
I'm very pleased
to meet you, sir.

57:36.658 --> 57:37.951
He's very weak.

57:42.372 --> 57:44.958
I want you to prepare
a hot bath and some clean clothes.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.168
And something to eat.

57:47.877 --> 57:48.962
Right away, ma'am.

58:08.480 --> 58:10.023
How are my little ones?

58:12.776 --> 58:13.568
Daddy!

58:16.989 --> 58:19.116
Why did you take so long?

58:26.415 --> 58:27.499
Hello, Nicholas.

58:28.083 --> 58:28.834
I told you, you see!

58:29.001 --> 58:30.544
I told you he'd come back.

58:38.217 --> 58:41.345
- Have you both been well behaved?
- We've been very good.

58:41.554 --> 58:44.181
- Have you been good to your mother?
- Very good.

58:44.390 --> 58:46.851
We study every day
for our First Communion.

58:48.227 --> 58:49.645
Daddy, did you kill anyone?

58:57.236 --> 58:58.195
Here he comes.

59:02.408 --> 59:04.951
Darling, we've prepared
lunch for you.

59:06.036 --> 59:07.912
Are you coming down
or would you prefer that?

59:20.342 --> 59:21.927
When's daddy coming down?

59:22.135 --> 59:24.554
Be patient, Anne.
Daddy is...

59:24.930 --> 59:26.181
not well.

59:26.723 --> 59:28.767
He said he'd seen
lots of dead men.

59:33.646 --> 59:37.066
Mummy, when people die
in the war, where do they go?

59:37.816 --> 59:38.817
Ah, what a question.

59:39.735 --> 59:40.819
It depends.

59:41.779 --> 59:42.821
On what?

59:42.988 --> 59:43.656
Well...

59:43.906 --> 59:46.659
on whether they fought on the side
of the "goodies" or the "baddies."

59:47.326 --> 59:50.496
Your father, for example, fought for
England, on the "goodies"' side.

59:53.832 --> 59:55.709
How do you know who
the "goodies" and the "baddies" are?

59:57.127 --> 01:00:00.130
That's enough questions. Eat
your food. You'll never go to war.

01:00:00.631 --> 01:00:02.258
We'll never go anywhere.

01:00:05.551 --> 01:00:07.512
You're not missing out on anything.

01:00:08.304 --> 01:00:12.183
You're much better at home with
mummy and daddy, who love you.

01:00:14.686 --> 01:00:15.603
And the intruders.

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:19.190
There are no intruders here.

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:22.026
But you said that there were.

01:00:22.235 --> 01:00:23.569
No, I said that
there are no intruders here.

01:00:23.778 --> 01:00:25.655
And I don't want to hear
another word on the subject.

01:00:25.863 --> 01:00:27.573
- But you said...
- No, that is enough!

01:00:29.117 --> 01:00:31.035
- Can I say something?
- No!

01:00:31.244 --> 01:00:33.954
- Why not?
- Because... because you can't!

01:00:41.169 --> 01:00:42.671
Anne, stop breathing like that.

01:00:45.424 --> 01:00:46.592
You heard me. Stop it!

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:51.930
Stop breathing!

01:00:54.683 --> 01:00:55.976
Right, you go to your room!

01:00:56.351 --> 01:00:58.562
Go to your room!
There's no dessert for you today.

01:01:05.318 --> 01:01:07.945
Oh, no crying now.
No crying.

01:01:08.946 --> 01:01:10.448
Oh, stop that... Here.

01:01:10.948 --> 01:01:13.451
Oh, look what an awful face
you've got when you cry.

01:01:13.659 --> 01:01:17.121
- I don't care!
- There, there.

01:01:17.663 --> 01:01:19.165
You listen to me.

01:01:21.417 --> 01:01:23.127
I've seen them too.

01:01:24.337 --> 01:01:25.338
You have?

01:01:26.339 --> 01:01:27.256
Yes.

01:01:28.132 --> 01:01:30.843
Then why don't you tell my mother?
Then maybe she'll believe me.

01:01:31.052 --> 01:01:33.970
There are things
your mother doesn't want to hear.

01:01:34.638 --> 01:01:36.014
She only believes in what

01:01:36.181 --> 01:01:38.266
she was taught.
But don't worry.

01:01:39.434 --> 01:01:40.810
Sooner or later,

01:01:42.145 --> 01:01:45.190
she'll see them.
And then everything

01:01:45.398 --> 01:01:47.901
- will be different.
- How?

01:01:49.361 --> 01:01:51.112
Oh, you'll see.

01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:53.198
There are going to be some

01:01:53.406 --> 01:01:54.574
big surprises.

01:01:55.825 --> 01:01:56.785
There are going to be...

01:01:58.411 --> 01:01:59.621
changes.

01:02:00.497 --> 01:02:01.706
Changes?

01:02:13.717 --> 01:02:15.344
Now she is behaving as if

01:02:15.594 --> 01:02:16.971
nothing had happened.

01:02:18.597 --> 01:02:20.057
What about her daughter?

01:02:20.724 --> 01:02:24.603
She's not so stubborn. The children
will be easier to convince.

01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:29.191
No, it's the mother who is going
to cause us problems.

01:02:31.318 --> 01:02:33.945
Do you think her husband
suspects anything?

01:02:35.655 --> 01:02:39.284
No, I don't think
he even knows where he is.

01:02:55.758 --> 01:02:58.011
Look what a pretty daughter
I've got.

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:03.682
Mummy made this veil
especially for you.

01:03:05.517 --> 01:03:07.060
I look like a bride.

01:03:08.937 --> 01:03:11.315
Yes, you do.

01:03:16.194 --> 01:03:18.488
Now I need to shorten
the sleeves a little.

01:03:19.489 --> 01:03:20.991
- You can take it off now.
- No.

01:03:21.158 --> 01:03:23.577
Anne, this dress has to be
spotless for your First Communion.

01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:25.287
I promise I won't dirty it.

01:03:25.495 --> 01:03:28.206
Just let me wear it for
a little longer. Just a little.

01:03:28.373 --> 01:03:29.917
Oh, just a little.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.251
All right.

01:03:33.711 --> 01:03:35.171
I'll be back shortly.

01:03:35.588 --> 01:03:38.341
No sitting on the floor.
No leaning against the walls.

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:58.152
Monsieur, would you like to dance?

01:04:01.529 --> 01:04:02.906
I'd love to.

01:04:26.471 --> 01:04:29.724
Charles, you can't go on like this.
You must eat something.

01:04:52.037 --> 01:04:53.372
...in the sky.

01:04:55.916 --> 01:05:00.087
I don't know
if it's cloudy or bright,

01:05:02.297 --> 01:05:05.091
because I only have eyes

01:05:06.593 --> 01:05:07.969
for you...

01:05:09.178 --> 01:05:10.179
dear...

01:05:11.347 --> 01:05:14.559
The moon may be high...

01:05:47.633 --> 01:05:49.676
Anne, you need to take
the dress off now.

01:05:53.931 --> 01:05:55.682
Anne, are you listening?

01:05:58.268 --> 01:05:59.061
Anne?

01:06:04.065 --> 01:06:06.442
What did I tell you
about sitting on the floor?

01:06:06.692 --> 01:06:07.735
But it's clean.

01:06:07.944 --> 01:06:11.113
It makes no difference. Why
can't you ever do as you're told?

01:06:35.845 --> 01:06:36.805
What's the matter?

01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:39.015
Where is my daughter?

01:06:42.811 --> 01:06:44.562
What have you done
with my daughter?

01:06:44.938 --> 01:06:47.983
Are you mad?
I am your daughter.

01:06:49.651 --> 01:06:50.819
You're not!
You're not

01:06:51.027 --> 01:06:51.945
my daughter!

01:06:56.741 --> 01:06:58.702
You're not my daughter!

01:07:14.008 --> 01:07:16.719
- Ma'am, I heard shouts.
- She wants to kill me!

01:07:16.969 --> 01:07:19.346
She won't stop
until she kills us!

01:07:19.513 --> 01:07:22.266
She won't stop!
She won't stop until she kills us!

01:07:22.433 --> 01:07:25.436
- Hush. Hush, child. Come with me.
- You're wicked! You're wicked!

01:07:26.562 --> 01:07:28.022
Wicked!

01:07:38.907 --> 01:07:39.866
How is she?

01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:44.287
There's no calming her
so I've left her with her father.

01:07:45.455 --> 01:07:47.624
She insisted
on speaking with him.

01:07:51.336 --> 01:07:52.253
What happened?

01:07:53.463 --> 01:07:54.422
Why did you fight?

01:07:54.923 --> 01:07:56.007
It wasn't her.

01:07:57.467 --> 01:08:00.302
It was the old woman
with the strange eyes.

01:08:00.469 --> 01:08:02.971
She was imitating
my daughter's voice.

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:05.682
I'd swear to God that
it wasn't my daughter.

01:08:08.644 --> 01:08:11.063
Oh, God.
God help me.

01:08:13.023 --> 01:08:15.025
God help me.
What's the matter with me?

01:08:16.109 --> 01:08:17.819
I don't know what's
the matter with me.

01:08:19.196 --> 01:08:21.113
You must get some rest.

01:08:23.492 --> 01:08:27.287
You can't take on all
the responsibility of this house.

01:08:28.330 --> 01:08:29.372
Leave it to us.

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:31.707
We know what has to be done.

01:08:35.461 --> 01:08:36.754
What do you mean by that?

01:08:38.631 --> 01:08:40.549
What do you mean you know
what has to be done?

01:08:40.841 --> 01:08:42.468
Nothing, ma'am.
I was just suggesting...

01:08:42.635 --> 01:08:44.011
There's nothing to suggest!

01:08:46.013 --> 01:08:48.765
Who do you think you are? You
have no idea what has to be done!

01:08:54.145 --> 01:08:55.231
Or do you?

01:08:59.024 --> 01:09:00.359
What are these?

01:09:03.779 --> 01:09:05.948
The tablets
for the migraine, ma'am.

01:09:07.492 --> 01:09:08.785
The ones you always take.

01:09:10.495 --> 01:09:12.122
Please, I need to be on my own.

01:09:14.124 --> 01:09:15.207
Yes, ma'am.

01:09:38.856 --> 01:09:40.024
Come on, child.

01:10:03.504 --> 01:10:05.048
Anne told me everything.

01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:14.515
I wish I had
an explanation, but I haven't.

01:10:15.558 --> 01:10:17.435
At first I thought there was
someone else in the house.

01:10:17.644 --> 01:10:18.978
I even thought that
there were ghosts.

01:10:19.312 --> 01:10:20.897
I'm not talking about the ghosts.

01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:24.901
I'm talking about
what happened that day.

01:10:32.532 --> 01:10:35.619
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:10:36.119 --> 01:10:37.746
Tell me what happened.

01:10:39.456 --> 01:10:40.415
Happened?

01:10:46.421 --> 01:10:47.297
I don't know what

01:10:47.506 --> 01:10:49.299
happened to me.

01:10:51.093 --> 01:10:53.345
The servants had left
during the night.

01:10:53.595 --> 01:10:56.640
They hadn't the courage
to tell me to my face.

01:10:59.350 --> 01:11:00.559
And they knew

01:11:01.811 --> 01:11:04.063
that I couldn't leave the house.

01:11:05.481 --> 01:11:06.774
They knew.

01:11:10.319 --> 01:11:11.112
Anne.

01:11:13.072 --> 01:11:15.408
Anne, what happened?

01:11:17.868 --> 01:11:19.537
She hit me.

01:11:20.371 --> 01:11:23.165
She went mad...
like she did that day.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.543
Do you remember?

01:11:27.544 --> 01:11:28.336
No.

01:11:31.006 --> 01:11:32.757
You must forgive me, Charles.

01:11:34.843 --> 01:11:35.719
Not me.

01:11:37.137 --> 01:11:37.929
The children.

01:11:39.055 --> 01:11:40.765
They know that I love them.

01:11:42.225 --> 01:11:46.021
They know I'd never hurt them.
I... I'd die first.

01:11:50.066 --> 01:11:51.359
What are you going to do?

01:11:53.153 --> 01:11:54.863
Are you angry with me?

01:11:59.116 --> 01:12:03.329
I came back to say goodbye to my
wife and children. Now I must go.

01:12:05.247 --> 01:12:06.206
Go where?

01:12:08.083 --> 01:12:09.084
To the front.

01:12:09.627 --> 01:12:10.669
The war's over.

01:12:11.962 --> 01:12:13.631
The war is not over.

01:12:13.797 --> 01:12:15.341
What are you talking about?

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:21.555
You're not going, do you hear me?
You left us once already. You can't!

01:12:23.557 --> 01:12:24.350
Why?

01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:26.644
Why did you have
to go to that stupid

01:12:26.851 --> 01:12:29.229
war that had nothing
to do with us?

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:32.106
Why couldn't you have stayed here

01:12:32.273 --> 01:12:34.192
- like the others did?
- The others surrendered.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.860
We all surrendered!

01:12:36.945 --> 01:12:38.947
The whole island was occupied!

01:12:39.948 --> 01:12:41.950
What did you expect?

01:12:47.288 --> 01:12:52.168
What were you trying to prove by
going to war? Your place was here,

01:12:54.295 --> 01:12:55.713
with us, your family.

01:13:02.135 --> 01:13:03.512
I loved you...

01:13:05.555 --> 01:13:07.349
and that was enough for me...

01:13:08.475 --> 01:13:11.228
living in this darkness...

01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:14.731
in this prison.

01:13:17.859 --> 01:13:19.570
But not for you...

01:13:21.154 --> 01:13:23.323
I wasn't enough for you.

01:13:24.283 --> 01:13:26.200
That's why you left.

01:13:29.412 --> 01:13:30.997
It wasn't just the war.

01:13:34.333 --> 01:13:36.752
You want to leave me, don't you?

01:14:27.092 --> 01:14:29.303
Forgive me, Grace.

01:15:43.542 --> 01:15:44.751
Anne!

01:15:46.211 --> 01:15:47.421
Nicholas!

01:15:57.930 --> 01:15:58.848
Oh, my God!

01:16:05.396 --> 01:16:06.188
Oh, my God!

01:16:07.773 --> 01:16:09.650
Wait! Oh, my God!

01:16:30.462 --> 01:16:31.838
Where are the curtains?

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:38.720
Mrs. Mills!

01:16:54.069 --> 01:16:54.902
Let me see.

01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:56.528
Let me see.

01:16:57.404 --> 01:16:58.405
Are you alright?

01:16:59.156 --> 01:16:59.949
You're alright!

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:01.283
I want my daddy!

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:08.958
Daddy's gone.

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:10.668
It's not true.

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:12.878
Yes, it is!

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:15.714
It is true.

01:17:18.425 --> 01:17:20.094
I love you, mummy.

01:17:28.393 --> 01:17:30.103
Find the curtains.

01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:34.190
Who was it?

01:17:34.774 --> 01:17:35.692
Who did this?

01:17:36.901 --> 01:17:37.986
Tell me!

01:17:38.903 --> 01:17:39.737
Tell me!

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:44.325
You know what's happening here.
You know because it happened

01:17:44.534 --> 01:17:46.786
to you too!
Now tell me!

01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:50.290
Write it down.
Write it down!

01:17:51.124 --> 01:17:51.833
Please.

01:17:52.417 --> 01:17:54.876
That attitude
won't solve anything, ma'am.

01:17:56.795 --> 01:17:58.338
And anyway she can't write.

01:17:58.589 --> 01:18:00.007
- Where are they?
- What?

01:18:00.382 --> 01:18:01.550
The curtains!

01:18:02.259 --> 01:18:05.888
The curtains my children's lives
depend on! Someone has taken them!

01:18:06.096 --> 01:18:09.683
I have noticed, ma'am. There's
no need for you to raise your voice.

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.770
Oh, Mr. Tuttle, I was just
on the point of calling you.

01:18:14.938 --> 01:18:17.774
Did you know someone's
taken all the curtains?

01:18:19.484 --> 01:18:20.444
The curtains?

01:18:22.029 --> 01:18:23.196
Oh, dear.

01:18:24.447 --> 01:18:25.656
Why should anyone

01:18:25.865 --> 01:18:27.283
want to take
all the curtains?

01:18:28.618 --> 01:18:31.203
Oh, to let some daylight
into this house, I imagine.

01:18:32.371 --> 01:18:34.457
Daylight... of course.

01:18:35.374 --> 01:18:37.084
Someone wants
to kill my children!

01:18:37.585 --> 01:18:39.795
Now why do you think
the daylight would kill them?

01:18:41.631 --> 01:18:42.632
Are you mad?

01:18:44.091 --> 01:18:45.343
I told you.

01:18:46.594 --> 01:18:49.013
I already told you,
the children are photosensitive!

01:18:49.222 --> 01:18:52.225
- The light will kill them!
- Yes, but that was

01:18:52.475 --> 01:18:53.600
before.

01:18:54.267 --> 01:18:56.519
The condition could have
cleared up by itself.

01:18:56.895 --> 01:18:59.105
I mean, if you never
expose them to daylight,

01:18:59.314 --> 01:19:00.899
how do you know
they're not cured?

01:19:01.566 --> 01:19:05.570
My sister-in-law used to get
terrible attacks of rheumatism

01:19:06.112 --> 01:19:07.572
in her legs and back.

01:19:09.074 --> 01:19:10.325
Then one fine day,

01:19:12.661 --> 01:19:13.954
they disappeared.

01:19:16.206 --> 01:19:19.084
I'm going to find those curtains,
and when you have finished helping

01:19:19.292 --> 01:19:21.086
me hang them,
you will leave this house.

01:19:35.307 --> 01:19:36.892
What about the master, ma'am?

01:19:37.643 --> 01:19:38.811
What does he have
to say about all this?

01:19:40.854 --> 01:19:41.981
Give me your keys.

01:19:43.649 --> 01:19:45.150
I want your keys now.

01:19:49.446 --> 01:19:50.614
I know what you want.

01:19:51.824 --> 01:19:52.907
You want to frighten us.

01:19:53.241 --> 01:19:54.534
You want to get us out,
me and my children.

01:19:54.784 --> 01:19:57.537
You've wanted to take over
this house ever since you arrived.

01:19:58.955 --> 01:20:02.125
Now, you give me those keys.
I will not ask again.

01:20:02.333 --> 01:20:03.918
You should try
and calm down, ma'am.

01:20:04.419 --> 01:20:06.713
Give me the keys!

01:20:08.673 --> 01:20:09.799
Give them to me!

01:20:16.514 --> 01:20:17.765
And now, get out of here.

01:20:36.199 --> 01:20:37.868
You know something, Mr. Tuttle?

01:20:39.244 --> 01:20:43.207
I think I've reached the end
of my tether. What about you?

01:20:44.625 --> 01:20:45.584
Oh, yes.

01:20:46.835 --> 01:20:47.961
Definitely.

01:20:49.630 --> 01:20:52.049
We'd better go
and uncover the gravestones.

01:21:31.711 --> 01:21:33.004
What's mummy doing?

01:21:33.463 --> 01:21:35.590
I've already told you.
She's gone mad.

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:37.384
- Liar.
- She's gone mad.

01:21:37.634 --> 01:21:38.635
Liar, liar...

01:21:38.843 --> 01:21:40.512
She's gone mad.
She's gone mad! She's gone mad!

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:41.638
Liar! Liar! Liar!

01:21:47.352 --> 01:21:48.520
Night time.

01:21:50.689 --> 01:21:51.690
Where are you going?

01:21:51.981 --> 01:21:52.940
I've had enough.

01:21:55.526 --> 01:21:57.027
I'm going to the woods
to look for daddy.

01:21:57.236 --> 01:21:58.612
Are you going to run away?

01:22:02.199 --> 01:22:04.618
If I hang on to the pipe,
I can climb down to the ground.

01:22:05.411 --> 01:22:06.620
It's very easy.

01:22:20.885 --> 01:22:23.344
If mummy finds out,
you're in for it.

01:22:24.178 --> 01:22:25.388
Yes, yes, yes.

01:22:35.481 --> 01:22:36.649
Anne, wait!

01:22:37.859 --> 01:22:39.402
I want to come
and look for daddy too.

01:22:39.819 --> 01:22:42.780
Liar, you just don't want
to be left on your own.

01:22:43.031 --> 01:22:44.365
Scaredypants, scaredypants!

01:22:44.616 --> 01:22:45.491
Be quiet!

01:23:39.919 --> 01:23:41.879
Anne, I think we've got lost.

01:23:42.129 --> 01:23:44.173
We still haven't left
the garden yet, silly.

01:23:45.466 --> 01:23:48.052
- I'm scared.
- You shouldn't have come then.

01:23:52.597 --> 01:23:55.183
- Say something.
- What shall I say?

01:23:55.934 --> 01:23:57.727
I don't know. Anything.

01:23:58.228 --> 01:24:00.689
Let's see.
My name's Anne and I'm walking.

01:24:00.897 --> 01:24:02.857
I'm walking
and my name is Anne.

01:24:30.384 --> 01:24:31.802
What's that over there?

01:24:34.805 --> 01:24:35.806
I think they're graves.

01:24:37.808 --> 01:24:38.893
Don't go near!

01:24:39.268 --> 01:24:40.019
Why not?

01:24:41.103 --> 01:24:42.813
What if a ghost jumps out?

01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:43.981
Graves don't have ghosts.

01:24:44.189 --> 01:24:45.608
Only skeletons.

01:25:03.208 --> 01:25:04.709
There's something written here.

01:25:04.918 --> 01:25:05.919
Let's go.

01:25:06.127 --> 01:25:07.003
Wait.

01:25:30.984 --> 01:25:31.777
Anne.

01:25:31.985 --> 01:25:33.362
What does it say?

01:25:41.703 --> 01:25:43.789
You must be strong
now, children.

01:25:44.039 --> 01:25:45.249
Nicholas, come here!

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:49.378
Mrs. Mills, please don't
tell mummy we've run away.

01:25:49.586 --> 01:25:50.628
Don't speak to them!

01:25:52.088 --> 01:25:52.797
Why?

01:25:53.047 --> 01:25:54.131
They're dead!

01:25:54.632 --> 01:25:57.051
- What?
- They're ghosts. Please come here.

01:25:57.927 --> 01:25:58.886
Children!

01:25:59.929 --> 01:26:01.013
Nicholas!

01:26:02.223 --> 01:26:07.061
Then why aren't they wearing sheets
and clanking chains? You said...

01:26:07.311 --> 01:26:09.522
I don't care what I said!
Get away from them!

01:26:10.147 --> 01:26:14.026
You're always teasing me and
telling lies, and I'm sick of it.

01:26:14.235 --> 01:26:17.321
I'm not teasing you!
I'm telling the truth! Come here!

01:26:20.699 --> 01:26:21.616
Quick!

01:26:26.872 --> 01:26:27.789
Children!

01:26:34.170 --> 01:26:34.963
Run!

01:26:35.714 --> 01:26:36.381
Run!

01:26:37.465 --> 01:26:39.467
Into the house.

01:26:42.596 --> 01:26:43.972
Don't come any closer!

01:26:44.973 --> 01:26:46.057
Don't move!

01:26:52.354 --> 01:26:53.981
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.

01:26:54.398 --> 01:26:56.192
Tuberculosis finished us off

01:26:56.942 --> 01:26:58.777
more than half a century ago.

01:27:19.422 --> 01:27:20.340
Go away!

01:27:27.096 --> 01:27:29.515
- Open the door, ma'am, please.
- What do you want?

01:27:30.016 --> 01:27:31.142
Mummy, don't open

01:27:31.392 --> 01:27:33.978
- the door, don't...
- We've seen their graves.

01:27:35.104 --> 01:27:36.189
Go upstairs and hide.

01:27:37.232 --> 01:27:39.067
- Go on!
- I'm scared.

01:27:45.406 --> 01:27:46.491
Don't separate.

01:27:51.662 --> 01:27:52.538
Anne.

01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:56.583
Whatever you do, don't separate.

01:27:58.126 --> 01:28:00.754
Go hide. Go! Go!

01:28:02.089 --> 01:28:04.383
We've been trying
to make you understand.

01:28:07.678 --> 01:28:08.762
Understand what?

01:28:08.971 --> 01:28:09.930
About the house.

01:28:11.098 --> 01:28:12.975
About the new situation.

01:28:13.934 --> 01:28:15.143
What situation?

01:28:16.311 --> 01:28:20.815
We must all learn to live
together. The living and

01:28:21.023 --> 01:28:21.941
the dead.

01:28:23.067 --> 01:28:25.945
If you're dead,
leave us in peace.

01:28:27.697 --> 01:28:29.115
Leave us in peace!

01:28:30.241 --> 01:28:32.159
Leave us in peace!

01:28:37.373 --> 01:28:39.333
In here. Get inside.

01:28:45.965 --> 01:28:49.301
And suppose we do leave you,
do you think they will?

01:28:50.385 --> 01:28:51.136
Who?

01:28:51.636 --> 01:28:52.846
The intruders.

01:28:54.431 --> 01:28:55.932
There are no intruders.

01:28:56.141 --> 01:29:00.145
They took the curtains down,
oh yes, I assure you it was them.

01:29:01.229 --> 01:29:03.690
And now they're
in there, with you

01:29:04.274 --> 01:29:05.358
and the children.

01:29:05.609 --> 01:29:06.526
Waiting for you!

01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:08.153
- No!
- Yes!

01:29:09.154 --> 01:29:11.990
And believe me,
sooner or later

01:29:12.741 --> 01:29:13.950
they'll find you.

01:29:15.118 --> 01:29:17.537
Listen, wait here
and I'll be back in a minute...

01:29:17.621 --> 01:29:19.455
Mummy said
we shouldn't separate.

01:29:19.663 --> 01:29:21.457
I can't leave her on her own.

01:29:26.545 --> 01:29:28.005
Stop breathing like that.

01:29:36.347 --> 01:29:38.390
Nicholas, stop
breathing like that.

01:29:41.602 --> 01:29:42.603
Stop breathing!

01:29:45.523 --> 01:29:46.690
Can't you hear it?

01:29:47.441 --> 01:29:48.650
There's someone there.

01:29:52.695 --> 01:29:54.822
Come with us, children.

01:29:55.782 --> 01:29:57.909
Come with us.

01:30:05.208 --> 01:30:06.167
Nicholas?

01:30:08.962 --> 01:30:09.754
Anne?

01:30:12.966 --> 01:30:13.925
Where are you?

01:30:17.594 --> 01:30:18.845
Answer me!

01:30:19.221 --> 01:30:22.766
- The intruders have found them.
- There's nothing we can do now.

01:30:23.976 --> 01:30:25.686
You'll have to go upstairs

01:30:26.311 --> 01:30:27.813
and talk to them.

01:30:45.789 --> 01:30:48.457
Our Father, who art in heaven,

01:30:49.041 --> 01:30:50.710
hallowed be Thy name,

01:30:51.252 --> 01:30:54.714
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth

01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:56.757
as it is in heaven.

01:30:58.301 --> 01:30:59.844
Give us this day our daily bread

01:31:00.595 --> 01:31:02.054
and forgive us our trespasses.

01:31:05.266 --> 01:31:07.852
Why are you crying, children?

01:31:08.436 --> 01:31:11.772
Why don't you want
to be our friends?

01:31:14.025 --> 01:31:16.736
Come on, speak to me.

01:31:24.034 --> 01:31:26.703
Tell me what happened.

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:31.291
Don't tell her!
Don't tell her!

01:31:32.250 --> 01:31:34.544
"Don't tell her."

01:31:35.337 --> 01:31:36.421
If I tell her,

01:31:37.297 --> 01:31:38.757
they'll leave us in peace.

01:31:41.384 --> 01:31:42.344
Mummy!

01:31:44.387 --> 01:31:45.305
"Mummy!"

01:31:46.389 --> 01:31:48.349
Why are you crying, children?

01:31:49.850 --> 01:31:51.977
What happened in this room?

01:31:53.312 --> 01:31:55.648
What did your mother do to you?

01:32:08.702 --> 01:32:09.995
Something about a pillow...

01:32:11.038 --> 01:32:12.331
Is that how

01:32:12.498 --> 01:32:13.499
she killed you?

01:32:15.251 --> 01:32:16.417
With a pillow?

01:32:16.918 --> 01:32:18.002
She didn't kill us.

01:32:18.294 --> 01:32:19.629
Children, if you're dead,

01:32:20.213 --> 01:32:22.632
why do you remain in this house?

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:24.259
We're not dead!

01:32:25.552 --> 01:32:28.054
Why do you remain in this house?

01:32:28.304 --> 01:32:30.014
We're not dead!

01:32:30.265 --> 01:32:31.599
We're not dead!

01:32:31.808 --> 01:32:33.017
We're not dead!

01:32:33.268 --> 01:32:35.937
Why do you remain in this house?

01:32:37.272 --> 01:32:38.898
"We're not dead, we're not

01:32:39.107 --> 01:32:39.941
dead."

01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:41.067
We're not dead!

01:32:41.276 --> 01:32:42.360
We're not dead!

01:32:43.319 --> 01:32:44.112
We're not dead!

01:32:45.697 --> 01:32:46.530
We're not dead!

01:32:46.738 --> 01:32:47.364
We're not...

01:32:48.824 --> 01:32:49.825
dead!

01:33:04.131 --> 01:33:05.215
Are you all right?

01:33:05.716 --> 01:33:06.508
Yes.

01:33:07.676 --> 01:33:09.386
Just a bit dizzy, that's all.

01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:12.347
What happened?

01:33:13.724 --> 01:33:16.058
They made contact.

01:33:16.767 --> 01:33:17.894
All three?

01:33:18.477 --> 01:33:20.396
Apparently, yes.

01:33:21.439 --> 01:33:23.274
The mother and
the two children.

01:33:25.193 --> 01:33:26.944
Quite interesting,
don't you think?

01:33:27.153 --> 01:33:28.154
Interesting?

01:33:28.529 --> 01:33:29.697
I was scared out of my wits!

01:33:30.615 --> 01:33:32.450
- Darling, calm down.
- No.

01:33:32.825 --> 01:33:36.537
So far we have handled this matter
your way. But now you listen to me.

01:33:36.913 --> 01:33:41.083
We can't possibly stay in this house
any longer. It's clear these beings

01:33:41.292 --> 01:33:42.585
do not want us to live here.

01:33:42.793 --> 01:33:44.921
- We don't know anything about them.
- Yes, we do.

01:33:46.379 --> 01:33:50.425
The woman went mad, smothered
her children and then shot herself.

01:33:51.259 --> 01:33:52.427
That's quite enough.

01:33:52.928 --> 01:33:55.555
- Think of our son.
- There's nothing wrong with Victor.

01:33:55.805 --> 01:33:56.681
Yes, there is!

01:33:57.516 --> 01:34:01.102
He has nightmares, he says
he has seen that girl. And even

01:34:01.311 --> 01:34:03.438
this lady has been possessed
by her. Please,

01:34:03.647 --> 01:34:06.733
- let us leave this house.
- All right.

01:34:08.193 --> 01:34:10.278
We will leave tomorrow morning.

01:34:11.196 --> 01:34:12.447
Thank God for that.

01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:16.700
I'll just go
and check on Victor.

01:34:20.371 --> 01:34:23.332
- Once again, thank you so much.
- A pleasure.

01:34:23.791 --> 01:34:26.502
- I hope we've been of some help.
- Oh, yes, of course.

01:34:26.669 --> 01:34:29.839
But I admit that was not the most
pleasant evening of my life.

01:34:31.757 --> 01:34:34.301
At first
I couldn't understand

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:38.848
what the pillow
was doing in my hands.

01:34:42.101 --> 01:34:43.853
And why you didn't move.

01:34:48.982 --> 01:34:50.233
But then I knew.

01:34:53.945 --> 01:34:55.113
It had happened.

01:34:59.701 --> 01:35:01.619
I'd killed my children.

01:35:08.543 --> 01:35:09.878
I got the rifle,

01:35:12.547 --> 01:35:14.215
I put it to my forehead...

01:35:19.052 --> 01:35:20.554
and I pulled the trigger.

01:35:25.684 --> 01:35:26.643
Nothing...

01:35:34.359 --> 01:35:37.237
And then I heard
your laughter in the bedroom.

01:35:41.909 --> 01:35:45.328
You were playing with the pillows,
as if nothing had happened.

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:49.165
And I thought...

01:35:51.334 --> 01:35:54.003
the Lord,
in His great mercy,

01:35:54.921 --> 01:35:56.130
was giving me

01:35:57.757 --> 01:35:58.966
another chance,

01:36:00.635 --> 01:36:01.594
telling me,

01:36:03.554 --> 01:36:04.555
"Don't give up,

01:36:08.267 --> 01:36:09.435
be strong.

01:36:11.896 --> 01:36:13.189
Be a good mother

01:36:15.815 --> 01:36:16.816
for them."

01:36:21.404 --> 01:36:22.364
But now...

01:36:26.576 --> 01:36:27.494
Now...

01:36:31.414 --> 01:36:33.208
What does all this mean?

01:36:37.921 --> 01:36:38.964
Where are we?

01:36:41.216 --> 01:36:43.552
Young Lydia asked
the very same thing

01:36:44.301 --> 01:36:47.221
when she realised
the three of us were dead.

01:36:48.305 --> 01:36:51.517
And that was the last time
she ever spoke.

01:36:54.228 --> 01:36:56.522
But I couldn't
tell you that before now.

01:37:01.235 --> 01:37:03.696
Shall I make
a nice cup of tea, ma'am?

01:37:08.993 --> 01:37:12.454
The intruders are leaving,
but others will come.

01:37:13.414 --> 01:37:17.709
Now, sometimes we'll sense them
and other times we won't.

01:37:19.544 --> 01:37:21.629
But that's the way
it's always been...

01:37:24.340 --> 01:37:25.550
Ma'am.

01:37:29.846 --> 01:37:30.930
Mummy...

01:37:32.473 --> 01:37:34.809
daddy died
in the war, didn't he?

01:37:35.226 --> 01:37:38.146
- Yes.
- Will we ever see him again?

01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:40.273
I don't know.

01:37:42.317 --> 01:37:43.401
If we're dead,

01:37:44.401 --> 01:37:45.819
where's Limbo?

01:37:50.115 --> 01:37:52.743
I don't know
if there is a Limbo.

01:37:55.787 --> 01:37:57.539
I'm no wiser than you are.

01:38:00.959 --> 01:38:02.920
But I do know
that I love you.

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.840
I've always loved you.

01:38:10.928 --> 01:38:12.804
And the house is ours.

01:38:14.889 --> 01:38:16.307
You say with me.

01:38:18.059 --> 01:38:20.436
- This house is ours...
- This house is ours...

01:38:20.686 --> 01:38:23.022
- This house is ours.
- This house is ours.

01:38:23.231 --> 01:38:26.025
- This house is ours.
- This house is ours.

01:38:43.583 --> 01:38:46.962
Mummy, look.
It doesn't hurt any more.

01:38:58.390 --> 01:39:00.851
No one can make us
leave this house.

01:39:27.668 --> 01:39:28.836
Come along, Victor.
