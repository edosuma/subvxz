Oh, I am so happy
in my laboratory.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.166
Even when my superior mind
is at rest,

01:59.200 --> 02:03.033
it fills me with glee
to have such love in my heart

02:03.066 --> 02:04.250
for what I have created.

You are not going
to run from me?

Not girls!

04:29.216 --> 04:30.133
I am doomed!

04:30.166 --> 04:33.283
Do not give up
so fast, Dexter.

This is wonderful!

04:47.466 --> 04:50.150
This is not good.

04:54.233 --> 04:56.000
All right, men,

04:56.033 --> 04:58.316
we must stop the intruders
at any cost.

04:58.350 --> 05:01.350
Some of you might not
make it back,

05:01.383 --> 05:04.033
but that is
a risk worth taking!

05:04.066 --> 05:06.116
You have received
your orders.

05:06.150 --> 05:08.216
Now, make me proud!

It is the fractional
dissection of--

you are both
mistaken.

of my freakin'
secret laboratory?!

Is that it?

You want this stick?
Can you get the stick? Ok.

stick around for this.

Yes, you got that stick,
didn't you?

09:16.066 --> 09:18.333
Now, you wait
right there, pupperoo,

09:18.366 --> 09:23.233
and I'll be right back
with a nice treat.

09:39.150 --> 09:41.100
Dad, I can explain.

09:41.133 --> 09:43.116
Dexter, how long
have you been

09:43.150 --> 09:46.200
keeping this lab
a secret from me?

09:46.233 --> 09:50.133
'Cause i'm
just crazy about
labrador retrievers!

They're such
good doggies.
Yes, they are!

Oh, the dog.
Right. Whew!

09:57.183 --> 10:00.150

of old buck

back on
granddad's farm.

10:02.116 --> 10:03.316
So, are you
gonna keep him?

10:03.350 --> 10:07.166
Well, I don't know.
I dog is a lot of
responsibility.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.133
I'd have to feed him
and walk him and
take care of him.

10:10.166 --> 10:13.116
I just--i don't know
if I'm ready for that.

10:13.150 --> 10:15.000
Well, then,
that settles it.

He's all yours, son,
you lucky stiff!

to follow you?

with the capacitor?

Oy. This dog is not
understanding what
I am telling him.

11:42.233 --> 11:45.183
I know not what of
which he is speaking.

unintelligibly]

he could speak
the simple English.

There you go,
boy.

12:03.116 --> 12:06.000

to translate

and enunciate
human speech.

does it work?

understand me?

13:23.350 --> 13:26.016
Dexter, I think
your buddy is trying

13:26.050 --> 13:27.133
to tell us
he's hungry.

13:27.166 --> 13:30.200
Why don't you take him
upstairs and feed him?

13:30.233 --> 13:31.383
I already fed him!

13:31.416 --> 13:36.083
Now, didn't we
have a talk about
responsibility today?

13:36.116 --> 13:37.133
We? Who's "we"?

13:37.166 --> 13:39.000
Take your buddy
upstairs!

13:39.033 --> 13:41.016
Yeah, but--

13:41.433 --> 13:44.266
hey! Hey, you dogs,
I can hear you barking!

13:44.300 --> 13:46.050
I'm a dog! Can you
hear me barking?

13:46.083 --> 13:50.016
Hey, dogs, listen to me!
I can hear you!
Hey! Hey! Hey, you!

13:50.050 --> 13:55.016
The moon, moon,
moo-oo-oon!

13:56.283 --> 13:58.166
The sun's up!
Hey, the sun is up!

13:58.200 --> 14:00.066
Get up, get up,
get up! Sun's up!

14:00.100 --> 14:01.183
You're up!
Sun's up.
Let's go out.

14:01.216 --> 14:03.266
The sun's up.
Want to go out?
Let's go out.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.350
Let's play.
The sun's up!

14:04.383 --> 14:06.283
What's that?
What's that?
What's that?!

14:06.316 --> 14:08.233
It's you, it's you,
it's you!

14:08.266 --> 14:09.483
And you're not
my dog!

14:10.016 --> 14:12.333
That means somebody
is looking for you,

14:12.366 --> 14:16.016
and I can only pray
that they call soon.

14:16.050 --> 14:16.466
[Ringing]

14:17.000 --> 14:18.416
Hello? Yes, yes,
I found a dog.

14:18.450 --> 14:21.183
The dog is here.
Yes, he's here.

14:21.216 --> 14:22.366
Ok, yes. Good. Ok!

14:22.400 --> 14:24.450
Hey, that's my dog!
I found my dog!

14:24.483 --> 14:26.150
It's my man!
I found my man!

14:26.183 --> 14:28.116
Both: I found you!
I found you! I found you!
I found you!

14:28.150 --> 14:30.000
Let's go for a ride.
You want to go
for a ride?

14:30.033 --> 14:33.433
Yeah, a ride!
Let's go for a ride!
Let's go for a ride!

14:38.283 --> 14:42.283
Gaze upon one of
the greatest achievements

14:42.316 --> 14:43.366
of modern science:

14:43.400 --> 14:47.366
The periodic table
of elements.

14:47.400 --> 14:51.250
This puzzle's
all mixed up.

14:51.283 --> 14:54.450
There.
That's better.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.300
Dee Dee!
Can you please check

15:22.333 --> 15:25.483
if your brother's
ready for school?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.300
What did you say, mom?!

15:30.333 --> 15:36.000
I said, go check
if Dexter's ready
for school.

15:36.033 --> 15:37.483
Ahh!

15:54.316 --> 15:56.000
[Whispering]
Dexter.

15:56.033 --> 15:59.116
Are you ready
for school?

15:59.416 --> 16:04.300
Ohh. There doesn't
seem to be any answer.

16:04.333 --> 16:07.066
I guess I'll have
to go inside.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.300
[Rattles doorknob]

16:08.333 --> 16:13.250
Ooh...
The door is locked.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.183
At last...

16:50.216 --> 16:53.100
My greatest work
completed!

16:53.133 --> 16:55.300
[Kisses loudly]

17:01.250 --> 17:02.350
Hi!

17:02.383 --> 17:05.400
What--what--
what are you doing
in my laboratory?

17:05.433 --> 17:11.116
I'm just here
to check up on my
favorite little brother.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.366
Stop that!

17:12.400 --> 17:15.416
I do not need you
to check up on me,

17:15.450 --> 17:19.083
so please
remove yourself
from my laboratory!

17:19.116 --> 17:21.383
Ooh! What's that?
Ohh!

17:21.416 --> 17:24.416
Ooh!

17:25.233 --> 17:26.416
[Giggles]

17:26.450 --> 17:29.400
Aaaah!

17:31.133 --> 17:32.416
Aaaah!

17:32.450 --> 17:36.233
Aaaaah!

17:38.233 --> 17:41.300
Aaaaah!

17:42.383 --> 17:45.366
[Giggles]

17:48.216 --> 17:51.033
Aaaaaah!

17:51.416 --> 17:54.100
You were playing
with my doll!

17:54.133 --> 17:57.116
I can't believe
you would walk
into my room,

17:57.150 --> 18:00.350
take my doll,
take it back
into your room,

18:00.383 --> 18:04.350
put it on
your stinky,
slimy machines,

18:04.383 --> 18:06.150
and then you--

18:06.183 --> 18:07.266
[gasps]

18:07.300 --> 18:09.016
Ooh...

18:09.050 --> 18:11.066
What does
this button do?

18:11.100 --> 18:14.366
Please, please!
Do not push the button!

18:14.400 --> 18:18.066
You have no idea
of what it--

18:18.100 --> 18:19.350
does.

18:19.383 --> 18:25.383
Ooh! Look what
a cute little
bunny rabbit!

18:25.416 --> 18:28.000
Let me go!

18:28.033 --> 18:31.450
Have you any idea
of what you have done?

18:31.483 --> 18:33.416
Hmm...no.

18:33.450 --> 18:37.400
Well, let me show you.
What would you like to be

18:37.433 --> 18:40.483
more than anything else
in the whole world?

18:41.016 --> 18:42.000
[Gasps]

18:42.033 --> 18:45.466
Ooh! I want to be
a beautiful Princess

18:46.000 --> 18:51.400
with
long golden hair
and a big red bow.

18:52.450 --> 18:56.483
And I want to live
in a big, big castle

18:57.016 --> 19:00.416
and have lots
and lots of horses!

19:08.033 --> 19:11.466
Now, do you understand
that by combining

19:12.000 --> 19:14.400
the positive and
negative polarities

19:14.433 --> 19:16.466
in sucrose radium...

19:17.000 --> 19:21.400
We can excrete
the elements from any
variety of zitgaforme.

19:21.433 --> 19:25.316
And unificate them
with the superlative
repercussions

19:25.350 --> 19:27.183
of the magnetic ospium.

19:27.216 --> 19:32.083
Thusly, this machine
should not be used by a--

19:32.116 --> 19:35.233
person of lower
intelligence, such as--

19:35.266 --> 19:36.483
[giggling]

19:37.016 --> 19:39.183
You are not
listening to me!

19:39.216 --> 19:41.433
Now, pay attention!

19:42.350 --> 19:45.016
Roarrrr!

20:11.033 --> 20:13.266
Make sure you two
brush your teeth

20:13.300 --> 20:17.150
before you come down
for breakfast.

20:24.333 --> 20:28.150
Mom: Kids!
Chew your food.

20:31.033 --> 20:35.300
Now go upstairs and
get ready for school.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.150
What are
those kids up to?

20:59.166 --> 21:03.333
Mom: That's it.
I'm coming upstairs.

21:26.066 --> 21:29.133
You kids stop fooling around
and come downstairs,

21:29.166 --> 21:31.116
or you'll miss your bus.

21:31.150 --> 21:33.366
Dee Dee's voice:
Last one down

21:33.400 --> 21:37.483
is an icky, icky,
slimy spider!

21:40.116 --> 21:46.100
Dexter's voice:
Why not? I've been
everything else today.

21:52.333 --> 21:54.000
Enter at your own peril,

21:54.033 --> 21:58.100
past the vaulted door where
impossible things may happen

21:58.133 --> 22:01.000
that the world's
never seen before.
