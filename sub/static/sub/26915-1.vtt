00:19.436 --> 00:24.357
Chocolate tortes, maple icing,
peanut butter balls...

00:24.441 --> 00:26.568
Grandma sure had a lot of recipes.

00:26.651 --> 00:29.571
Oh, Grandma used to make
the best desserts.

00:29.654 --> 00:32.115
Carrot cake,
double chocolate chunk cookies...

00:32.198 --> 00:34.909
Mmm, stop. You're making me hungry.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.161
-Aha!
-Ooh!

00:36.244 --> 00:40.373
Found it! "Grandma's famous
Chocolate Coconut Cake!"

00:40.457 --> 00:42.667
-[sighs]
-That looks complicated.

00:42.751 --> 00:46.671
You sure you know what you're doing?
I've never seen you bake before.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.549
I'll just follow the recipe.
How hard can it be?

00:50.216 --> 00:53.595
Grandpa is gonna be so-- Grandpa!

00:53.678 --> 00:55.764
Happy birthday!

00:55.847 --> 00:58.391
Thank you, Skye!

00:58.475 --> 01:01.644
-And one hot tea for the birthday boy!
-[Grandpa] Oh!

01:01.728 --> 01:04.773
-Just what these old bones needed.
-[laughs]

01:04.856 --> 01:08.818
I put it in a traveler's mug so you can
just take it outside with you.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.321
Wow, that's so thoughtful.
Thank you. Okay.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.656
So, how's Winston settling in?

01:13.948 --> 01:18.286
You know, with us old guys
it takes a little time, but we get there.

01:18.369 --> 01:21.581
You should probably go outside
now and check on him.

01:23.291 --> 01:24.834
If I didn't know better...

01:24.918 --> 01:28.171
you two are trying to get rid of me.
What's going on here?

01:29.047 --> 01:32.050
-It's a beautiful day outside.
-Yeah, yeah. I hear you.

01:32.133 --> 01:36.262
[gasps, grunts] But you're gonna
kick an old man out on his birthday?

01:38.264 --> 01:39.307
Come here.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.017

-Alright.

-Now, get outside.
-I'm out.

-[door opening, closing]
-Olivia and I should get going.

01:46.189 --> 01:48.191
We're gonna bike to my appointment.

01:48.566 --> 01:52.195
It's great, the two of you
working together on the presentation.

01:52.278 --> 01:54.405
Yeah. It'll be great.

-Ugh!

Hey, guys. How's the sweeping going?

03:17.739 --> 03:21.576
-Great! Who's this?
-This is Winston. He's our newest rescue.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.995
Winston. I like that name.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.497
He used to be
a pretty excellent work horse,

03:26.581 --> 03:28.625
but he's starting to get a little older.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.377
His previous owner decided
once he went blind

03:31.461 --> 03:33.588
he really had no use for him.

03:33.671 --> 03:35.256
So, we ended up with him.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.343
He can't see? That's so sad.

03:38.426 --> 03:41.012
Well, he's gonna face some challenges,

03:41.095 --> 03:44.265
but a blind horse can still have
a pretty good life.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.143
He'll be galloping through the fields

-Monday.
-Monday.

04:21.928 --> 04:25.056
That's good. You'll have the weekend
to prep together.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.976
Yep. We can practice till it's perfect!

04:28.059 --> 04:30.228
Let's stay away from the word "perfect."

04:30.311 --> 04:34.691
Nobody's perfect.
Let's and focus on "doing our best."

04:34.774 --> 04:37.360
What if I freeze
in front of the whole class,

04:37.443 --> 04:39.612

04:39.696 --> 04:42.156
Presentations can be stressful for anyone.

-But not everyone has dyslexia.
-[Wendy] That's true.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.539
But you learn differently
from other people, Skye.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.499
That doesn't make you less capable.

04:51.582 --> 04:54.419
I just wish
we didn't have to work in partners.

It's just I have enough trouble
working on my own,

05:02.885 --> 05:05.388
and now I'm responsible
for your grade, too.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.892
I'm not worried about our grade.
We're going to do a great job.

05:10.351 --> 05:11.311
We're a team.

05:12.353 --> 05:15.523
Now, tell me a little more
about the presentation.

05:16.441 --> 05:20.403
Well, we're researching
the "Life Cycle of a Frog."

05:20.486 --> 05:23.239
We want to present information
in a creative way.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.367
I was thinking
it could be fun to do it as a rap.

05:26.451 --> 05:30.705
You know,
kind of like a "Hip Hop Ribbit!" [giggles]

05:30.788 --> 05:32.457
[Wendy] That's a great idea!

05:32.540 --> 05:36.002
And you'll definitely earn bonus marks
for creativity.

05:36.085 --> 05:40.089
And speaking in rhythm might help
remember putting the words together.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.258
I hope so.

Just remember to breathe
and take the time that you need.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.953

I have no idea what I'm doing. [chuckles]

06:11.037 --> 06:13.748
Why don't you buy a cake? My mom does.

06:13.831 --> 06:16.542

will get a big slice when we're done.

Then let's not waste another minute!

06:25.635 --> 06:29.555
[groans] Um, first up, it says...

06:29.931 --> 06:33.226
"two cups all-purpose flour."

06:34.018 --> 06:35.019
On it!

06:38.272 --> 06:42.693
Maybe we should fill it to the top
to be extra accurate with ingredients.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.321
We don't want to run
into a dessert disaster.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.702
Um, where's the mixing bowl?

06:52.286 --> 06:55.456
Mixing bowl? Right! Of course!
We need a mixing bowl.

06:55.540 --> 06:59.335
We got to mix our ingredients.
But the recipe didn't say that.

-Here...

07:03.172 --> 07:05.675
is our mixing--

07:08.177 --> 07:11.389
-I think that's a little too much flour.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.771
Well, he's had some trouble settling in.

07:18.855 --> 07:22.733
He's not exploring the ring the way
I'd hoped, he's not eating a lot.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.446
But I think he'll find his way.

I was just taking some pictures.

07:46.924 --> 07:49.594
You know, horses are intuitive.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.721
Probably sensed you've got a good heart.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.557
He can sense that? Whew.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.602
You know what?
You could probably help Winston.

07:58.394 --> 08:02.440
You could let your voice act as his eyes.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.903
You could show him around
until he becomes familiar.

08:07.862 --> 08:11.616
I don't know. Skye would be best.
She's good with that.

08:11.699 --> 08:14.160
Nah. He's chosen you.

Okay, teammate.

Ready to work?

08:31.928 --> 08:32.762
Ready.

08:33.804 --> 08:37.725
Here's some ideas I wrote last night
based on our research notes.

08:38.267 --> 08:41.854
How about I read the first line,
you read the second?

08:42.605 --> 08:44.065
-Sounds good.
-Alright.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.692
"Frog eggs are slimy,
translucent and teeny."

08:48.903 --> 08:51.656
-Okay, so the next line is yours.
-Oh! Uh...

08:51.739 --> 08:57.453
"Next up comes a ta...
tap... dole... ta... with--"

08:57.703 --> 08:59.997
So, the word is "tadpole."

09:00.081 --> 09:01.165
Tadpole.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.961
Why don't you read the first two lines?

09:05.461 --> 09:06.504
Okay. Okay.

09:07.463 --> 09:10.424
"Next up comes a tadpole
with big eyes on its beany."

09:11.425 --> 09:13.094
-"Beany"?
-Yeah.

09:14.178 --> 09:16.764
I don't know what that word is.

09:17.098 --> 09:21.102
Uh, you know, beany. It's your head.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.648
I have enough trouble
reading words that I know.

09:25.731 --> 09:29.902
How am I supposed to read
that ridiculous word?

09:29.986 --> 09:33.656
I'm sorry, I didn't even think about that.
That's okay.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.032
No problem, teammate.

09:43.624 --> 09:46.127
-What's next?
-Um...

09:46.836 --> 09:50.047
Let's see, one teaspoon of salt.

Uh, Shelby dear,
your horse thingies have arrived.

10:10.776 --> 10:13.613
-Good. I've been needing those.
-What did you get?

10:13.696 --> 10:15.197
I can't remember.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.367
Okay, let's stay focused,
cake making. What's next?

10:18.451 --> 10:20.786
Um, did you add the salt?

10:22.747 --> 10:26.334
I think so?
[gasps] I remember saying "salt."

10:27.710 --> 10:29.795
Did I add the salt? Oh, no.

10:31.213 --> 10:35.092
Did I add the salt?

10:35.176 --> 10:38.179
Just look in the bowl.
Can you see the salt?

10:38.262 --> 10:40.556
Well, that looks like salt.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.476
Yeah, but it also looks like sugar.

10:43.559 --> 10:46.437
I only bought enough butter
for one cake. We can't start over.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.522
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

10:48.606 --> 10:53.110
We can easily figure this out
salt and sugar taste very different.

10:58.866 --> 11:03.079

but it tastes awful!

11:04.038 --> 11:06.290
[Ethan] This is a riding ring.

11:06.374 --> 11:12.213
There is nothing in your way.
No trees, no roots or rocks, actually.

11:12.296 --> 11:15.049
There's really nothing to worry about.

11:15.132 --> 11:19.303
Slowly, walk. Come on, you can do it.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.932
There you go. That's it.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.476
You're doing it. Getting the hang of it.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.313
-Door! Oh, my goodness, Ethan!
-[whinnying]

11:29.772 --> 11:31.690

11:31.774 --> 11:34.360

in the riding ring!

Great job, Winston! Come over here.

11:37.613 --> 11:40.574
-[yells] Over here!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Trish.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.660
Give me a hand in the paddock.

11:44.912 --> 11:47.748
-[whinnies]
-It's okay, Winston.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.583
It's okay. I'm here.

11:51.419 --> 11:55.506
Okay. Let's try it again.
It'll be better this time.

11:57.341 --> 12:00.803
"Frog... egg..."

12:01.303 --> 12:05.349
Your therapist mentioned it might
be easier to listen to the rhythm.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.518
So maybe I can...

12:07.601 --> 12:11.313
[clapping] Okay? So let's try it together.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.191
One, two, three, four.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.568
"Frog eggs--"

12:15.651 --> 12:18.195
That's when you come in, okay?
Right there.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.572
This isn't working.

12:20.281 --> 12:23.284
It can work. We've changed the words.
It should be easier.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.536
Reading isn't easy to me.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.874
I know. That's why we break it down
to find a way to make it work.

12:30.499 --> 12:33.502
I'm sorry you have to
break things down for me.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.880
I'm just trying to help.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.967
-Well, your rap isn't working.
-I could read the whole rap.

12:40.050 --> 12:44.680
And I stand in front of the class
and do nothing?

12:45.014 --> 12:47.683
You said you were worried
about freezing up.

12:47.766 --> 12:51.187
I don't want to put pressure on you,
but I get A's, and--

12:51.270 --> 12:55.191
-You weren't worried about grades.
-I wasn't, then.

12:56.317 --> 12:57.318
Hmm.

12:58.319 --> 13:01.530
You can do the project on your own.
You'll be better off.

13:01.822 --> 13:04.408
-Skye?
-I need some air.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.330
[birds chirping]

13:12.249 --> 13:14.502
Okay. Moment of truth.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.719
Oh! It didn't rise!

13:25.095 --> 13:26.096
[sighs]

13:33.854 --> 13:36.482
-[sighs]
-It's not so bad.

13:36.815 --> 13:38.150
It's a little flat.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.904
Were you trying to make a pancake?

13:44.156 --> 13:47.493
You know what?
It's all about how it tastes.

13:47.993 --> 13:51.872
If we put a thick layer of icing on,
no one will tell the difference.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.092
[sighs]

14:04.301 --> 14:07.471
-We're gonna need a lot more icing.
-You think?

14:09.181 --> 14:12.560
This is where you eat.
I got lots of treats for you to eat.

14:12.643 --> 14:15.062
Some grain, um...

14:15.145 --> 14:19.024
I got some hay, water. Anything you want.

14:19.400 --> 14:23.112
Come on, you've got to eat.
See, look? Eat?

14:23.863 --> 14:26.907
Oh, yeah, he can't see. Smell? Smell it.

14:28.659 --> 14:32.788
[laughs] Whoa! Whoa! You're hungry there.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.800
[frogs croaking]

14:48.429 --> 14:50.139
Oh, look. Frog eggs.

14:50.723 --> 14:51.849
[Olivia] Whoa!

14:52.933 --> 14:55.895
We should bring some to show
during our presentation.

14:55.978 --> 14:59.982
I don't think we should disrupt them.
They have a lot of growing to do.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.237
Wait. You still want to be my partner?

15:06.280 --> 15:07.156
Of course I do!

15:07.239 --> 15:11.827
I'm... I'm sorry if I pushed you too hard.
I was trying to help, but...

15:12.369 --> 15:14.038
I think I made things worse.

15:14.622 --> 15:19.460
I was worried about letting you down.
I couldn't focus on my work.

15:19.919 --> 15:23.380
Grades are important to me.
But you're important, too.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.593
I also know
we can make this work together.

15:28.510 --> 15:31.931
Still, I don't think I'm gonna be able
to read the rap.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.600
Maybe not the way we're trying.

15:35.142 --> 15:40.481
Wendy says you learn in a different way.
So... let's try something different.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.149
I don't know.

15:42.483 --> 15:46.737
You're so hard on yourself!
You're the smartest person I know.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.990
You know more
about animals than I will.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.036
When I'm with animals,
all kinds of words come to mind.

15:54.119 --> 15:56.538
I'm not nervous at all.

15:57.957 --> 16:01.001
Well, then let's forget
about the words on the page.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.419
Tell me what you see.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.173
-I see frog eggs.
-[laughs]

16:07.508 --> 16:09.093
-They're slimy.
-Yeah.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.262
Translucent.

16:13.597 --> 16:15.265
-Tiny!
-[faint splash]

16:15.349 --> 16:16.892
-Oh, there!
-Whoa!

16:16.976 --> 16:19.228
There's a tadpole with...

16:20.354 --> 16:22.648
[both] Eyes on its beany!

16:22.731 --> 16:23.774
[laughing]

16:24.733 --> 16:27.069
Yeah! Alright.

16:27.152 --> 16:31.949
I guess when I see the frog
it helps me understand the words.

16:32.366 --> 16:35.744
Maybe we can take pictures,
have lots of visuals,

16:35.828 --> 16:40.290
and that way,
I can describe the frog's progression.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.002
That's an awesome idea.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.045
[both chuckle]

16:45.129 --> 16:48.048
Oh, I got to get some
of these frog eggs. Here.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.385
[camera shutter clicking]

16:52.636 --> 16:54.596
-Whoa!
-Oh!

16:57.641 --> 17:00.060
[Bianca] I don't know why you're so upset.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.771
Cakes are so passé.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.232
That was my dad's favorite.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.902
It was my mother's recipe.
She was a great baker.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.780
-And you're--
-Learning!

17:12.239 --> 17:15.200
-It was a great first attempt.
-[Bianca] Wait!

17:16.160 --> 17:18.287
I know it looks horrendous,

17:18.370 --> 17:21.081
but there's no need
to throw it in the trash.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.918
-[sighs]
-I haven't even gotten to eat any.

17:25.002 --> 17:28.088
No, but look at it. It's a terrible cake.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.091
Yes, it is. Oh!

17:31.258 --> 17:33.552
But it could make a delightful trifle.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.722
I don't have the recipe for that!

17:36.805 --> 17:40.476
Following a recipe
can make a trifle, sure.

17:40.559 --> 17:43.896
But following your taste buds
will make it delicious!

17:43.979 --> 17:45.189
Ah, now...

17:45.898 --> 17:46.732
Custard.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.152
Whipped cream.

17:50.652 --> 17:52.738
Berries. Oh, yes!

17:52.821 --> 17:54.615
There is hope yet!

17:55.783 --> 17:57.451
[Bianca] Okay.

17:57.868 --> 17:58.702
Okay.

17:59.745 --> 18:00.829
[sighs] Ha!

18:04.833 --> 18:05.876
[horse whinnying]

18:13.258 --> 18:15.761
You're hungry, weren't you? [chuckles]

18:17.012 --> 18:19.223
Wow, Ethan. You got Winston to eat?

18:19.306 --> 18:21.558
-Happy dance! Happy dance!
-Trish!

18:21.934 --> 18:23.685
-[Trish] What?
-Look at Winston.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.355
-He must be full.
-[whinnying]

18:26.438 --> 18:28.774
-Full dance, full dance!
-Trish!

18:28.857 --> 18:31.360
-What?
-Winston can't see.

18:31.735 --> 18:35.239
Trust me, Winston,
these are some sweet moves.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.615
Shh!

18:37.366 --> 18:39.952
Winston's getting used
to things around here.

18:40.035 --> 18:43.831
But when you're dancing all crazy
and making loud noises,

18:44.748 --> 18:47.835
he gets scared and tenses up.

18:48.043 --> 18:49.461
How do you know all that?

18:50.087 --> 18:52.381
He's calm when things around him are calm.

18:52.464 --> 18:56.844
And he's scared and nervous
when things around him aren't.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.597
[Ethan] We got to watch out
for each other. All of us.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.685
-[sighs] Time for a treat.
-[shouts] Can I help?

19:04.768 --> 19:06.228
[Winston whinnies]

19:06.770 --> 19:08.856
-Sorry.
-Here.

19:10.065 --> 19:13.527
Raise it up. Slowly. Nice and easy.

19:13.610 --> 19:16.989
[Ethan] He'll come to you. Slowly, nice.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.825
And he's got a great sense of smell.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.994
Right here. Perfect.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.373
He'll know when you have one. Oh!

19:27.541 --> 19:29.501
[Ethan sighs] Good boy.

You're such a great partner.

Did we make it in time for Grandpa's cake?

20:16.048 --> 20:17.299
Well...

20:18.467 --> 20:21.637
That's one strange-looking cake.

-You're telling me.
-How did working on your presentation go?

20:25.766 --> 20:29.728
-Well, it started off a little bumpy.
-But we found our rhythm.

just grab more carrots.

Ethan has managed to get Winston to eat.

-Hey, great job, Ethan!
-Wow!

20:48.664 --> 20:50.332
It's okay, Dad, you can look.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.627
Surprise!

20:54.962 --> 20:57.547
What is this? [chuckles]

20:57.631 --> 21:02.636
-[sighs] It was supposed to be--
-It's called "Billy's Triumphant Trifle."

21:03.220 --> 21:06.765
-And you're going to love it.
-Happy birthday, Grandpa.

21:06.848 --> 21:09.101
-Happy birthday, Dad.
-[all] Happy birthday!

21:09.184 --> 21:11.019
-Thank you!
-Can we try this thing?

21:11.103 --> 21:13.563
-Can we try this thing already?
-Okay.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.066
Mm...

21:17.150 --> 21:19.278
-For the birthday boy!
-Thank you.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.238
-[Olivia] How'd you do this?
-Me next!

21:22.114 --> 21:25.200
-It's our little secret. There you go.
-Yes!

21:25.284 --> 21:28.245
-Oh! Oh!
-There you go!

21:28.328 --> 21:33.041
I hope you kept the recipe,
because this is absolutely delicious!

21:33.125 --> 21:36.753
Oh, well, I suppose
I shall have to try some.

-No need to be shy!
-Oh! Get right in there!

21:44.177 --> 21:46.138
Well, there you go.

21:46.221 --> 21:49.057
Alright. Yeah!

21:49.141 --> 21:51.268
-Now it's my turn.
-She's not shy!

21:51.351 --> 21:53.020
Let's see what this is made of!

21:54.062 --> 21:54.896
[Bianca] Mm.
