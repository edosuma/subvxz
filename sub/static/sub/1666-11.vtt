00:00.660 --> 00:02.000
Previously on "The originals"

00:02.000 --> 00:05.650
This town was my home once. I want it back.

00:05.650 --> 00:07.370
I want you to help me take new orleans

00:07.370 --> 00:08.980
from under all of their noses,

00:09.550 --> 00:11.210
and I have someone on the inside.

00:12.500 --> 00:13.850
I need something from you

00:13.850 --> 00:15.710
So that the witches can
complete the harvest.

00:15.710 --> 00:18.690
I need to consecrate the
remains of a powerful witch.

00:18.700 --> 00:20.070
Her name is Celeste Dubois.

00:20.070 --> 00:21.780
You and she have a friend in common.

00:21.810 --> 00:22.840
Elijah.

00:22.970 --> 00:24.220
The harvest is incomplete,

00:24.220 --> 00:25.620
and if they don't finish it, it's over.

00:25.620 --> 00:26.970
All our power will drain away.

00:26.970 --> 00:28.680
Our magic fades.

00:28.680 --> 00:32.229
Accept this offering as
a sign of our faith.

00:32.229 --> 00:33.260
Every girl who died

00:33.260 --> 00:35.010
released her power onto the next.

00:35.010 --> 00:35.980
When I was the last one,

00:35.980 --> 00:37.140
I suddenly had all of it.

00:38.370 --> 00:39.800
An artist, huh? That's cool.

00:39.820 --> 00:41.450
These drawings, what are they?

00:41.460 --> 00:42.610
She called them evil.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.400
Oh, my god.

00:46.990 --> 00:48.200
Hello, Celeste.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.770
The italians call them strega.

00:55.130 --> 00:57.690
The Yoruba of west Africa call them aje,

00:57.690 --> 00:58.660
meaning mother.

01:00.710 --> 01:03.060
Where my mother as from,
they called them hexa,

01:03.070 --> 01:05.920
and here we call them witch.

01:07.370 --> 01:09.120
Over the centuries,
vampires have fought them

01:09.120 --> 01:10.490
and fought beside them,

01:10.500 --> 01:12.360
bedded them and burned them.

01:13.580 --> 01:14.900
Whether adversary or ally,

01:14.900 --> 01:17.040
and they have been a force
to be reckoned with.

01:18.090 --> 01:20.360
Their ancestral magic anchors this city.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.800
There's never been one all-powerful witch

01:22.910 --> 01:24.090
until Davina.

01:24.790 --> 01:26.380
Who is now tucked in

01:26.410 --> 01:29.980
safe and sound down the
hall under my protection.

01:31.130 --> 01:33.520
Your Celeste was quite beautiful

01:34.060 --> 01:36.140
and a portent of evil according

01:36.140 --> 01:38.400
to our volatile artist in residence.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.870
Yes. Perhaps Davina's mistaken

01:39.870 --> 01:42.390
what she calls evil for power.

01:42.390 --> 01:45.150
Celeste was certainly
very powerful in her day,

01:45.150 --> 01:46.820
but she's been dead for over 200 years.

01:46.820 --> 01:50.140
I don't understand why
all these sketches now.

01:50.670 --> 01:52.700
Why does any witch do anything?

01:58.020 --> 01:59.250
Go away!

02:03.120 --> 02:05.240
Come on. You got to be starving.

02:05.240 --> 02:06.040
You haven't eaten since--

02:06.040 --> 02:07.810
since your best friend
killed my best friend?

02:07.810 --> 02:08.850
Davina, I'm sorry about

02:08.850 --> 02:10.130
what happened to this kid Tim.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.410
I'm sorry you don't hate
Klaus for what he did

02:12.970 --> 02:14.190
or want to make him pay.

02:14.190 --> 02:15.060
He'll pay for

02:15.060 --> 02:16.240
what he did one way or the other,

02:16.240 --> 02:18.440
but right now, I just want
to make peace with you.

02:18.450 --> 02:19.430
Why?

02:19.740 --> 02:20.370
So we can be

02:20.370 --> 02:23.110
one big happy frankenstein family?

02:26.570 --> 02:27.870
Well, that's going well.

02:27.870 --> 02:30.070
If you were trying to win the girl's trust,

02:30.180 --> 02:32.050
perhaps poisoning her one true love

02:32.060 --> 02:34.020
was not the most splendid idea.

02:34.020 --> 02:36.210
Oh. Are there any more inopportune deaths

02:36.220 --> 02:38.060
you'd like to wave in my face?

02:38.060 --> 02:39.190
Give me a month.

02:39.840 --> 02:40.940
I'll get you list.

02:44.910 --> 02:47.580
Young, old, dead, or alive,

02:47.580 --> 02:49.520
witches are a pain in the ass.

03:00.660 --> 03:02.100
Davina, Davina!

03:03.430 --> 03:04.770
What's with all the racket?

03:09.470 --> 03:10.570
Bloody hell.

03:15.030 --> 03:15.990
Elijah?

03:17.670 --> 03:19.600
There's something you need to know.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.200
What the hell is going on?

03:41.390 --> 03:42.300
Davina.

03:57.690 --> 04:00.400
Hey. What kind of game do
you think you're playing?

04:00.740 --> 04:01.960
I said disrupt the household,

04:01.960 --> 04:03.370
not destroy the whole city.

04:03.400 --> 04:04.510
I didn't do it.

04:05.260 --> 04:06.130
Not on purpose.

04:06.130 --> 04:08.800
I--I don't know what's wrong with me.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.180
This is madness.

04:14.190 --> 04:15.470
How can a 16-year-old girl

04:15.470 --> 04:17.220
shake the entire French quarter?

04:17.300 --> 04:18.350
I seen her rock the church,

04:18.350 --> 04:19.899
but I've never seen anything like this.

04:19.899 --> 04:21.870
How did you control her
when she was in the attic?

04:21.870 --> 04:22.950
I didn't have to,

04:23.290 --> 04:24.970
but then I never killed her boyfriend.

04:24.970 --> 04:27.760
Yes, yes. We've been
over this part already.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.850
The point is in her present state

04:29.850 --> 04:31.900
she's useless as a tool
against the witches.

04:31.900 --> 04:33.980
She's not a tool.
Something's wrong with her.

04:34.020 --> 04:35.900
She has too much power
that she cannot control.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.150
that much we already knew.

04:37.850 --> 04:39.080
But why is it manifesting itself

04:39.080 --> 04:40.700
in such an aggressive manner?

04:42.020 --> 04:43.150
Where are you going?

04:43.220 --> 04:44.560
This is witch business.

04:45.170 --> 04:46.830
Let's ask a witch.

04:51.300 --> 04:52.690
You're going to see Sophie.

04:54.150 --> 04:55.350
You don't have to eavesdrop.

04:56.420 --> 04:57.900
I keep nothing from you.

04:58.260 --> 05:00.440
Yeah. Well, I don't want to
keep anything from you either,

05:00.440 --> 05:02.430
and if you're going out to see Sophie,

05:02.430 --> 05:05.130
then there's something
that you should know.

05:06.710 --> 05:09.900
She called me and asked me for a favor.

05:10.050 --> 05:11.860
She promised me that she would help

05:11.870 --> 05:13.770
break the curse that
Marcel put on my people

05:13.770 --> 05:15.250
in exchange for some information.

05:15.250 --> 05:16.400
And I didn't think anything of it,

05:16.400 --> 05:18.480
but then Davina started doing
those pictures of Celeste--

05:18.480 --> 05:19.650
Whatever this is,

05:20.550 --> 05:21.970
you have to tell me.

05:30.050 --> 05:33.000
Sophie wanted to find Celeste's remains,

05:33.940 --> 05:35.510
so I...

05:36.680 --> 05:37.970
went through your journals,

05:37.970 --> 05:39.840
and I found out where you buried her,

05:39.840 --> 05:41.220
and then I told her.

05:43.830 --> 05:46.900
I know it was stupid and it was snoopy,

05:46.900 --> 05:49.690
And I--I should have just asked you.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.480
Please say something.

05:57.430 --> 05:58.440
Please.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.420
She wanted to be left in peace.

06:06.820 --> 06:08.760
When a witch's remains are consecrated,

06:08.760 --> 06:10.980
that power fuels the
rest of their community.

06:11.630 --> 06:14.140
Celeste did not want her
remains to be found.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.400
She made me promise to bury her

06:16.400 --> 06:17.830
where she would not be found.

06:17.830 --> 06:19.680
You not only violated my privacy,

06:20.980 --> 06:23.280
You have broken my promise to her.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.900
I thought they were just bones, Elijah.

06:31.750 --> 06:33.220
If you truly believed that,

06:34.360 --> 06:36.310
why didn't you ask me where to find her?

06:55.780 --> 06:57.950
If that's dinner, I pass.

06:57.950 --> 07:00.050
Sophie, where have you been?

07:00.300 --> 07:02.450
Short answer-- grave robbing.

07:02.590 --> 07:03.850
Stop whatever you're doing.

07:03.850 --> 07:05.390
We need to find Davina.

07:05.650 --> 07:07.810
I figured out a way to
complete the harvest.

07:09.150 --> 07:10.910
What? How?

07:11.200 --> 07:13.090
We need an elder to do it, right?

07:13.540 --> 07:15.310
I figured out a way how to become one.

07:15.550 --> 07:17.740
Soph, you can't just become an elder.

07:18.150 --> 07:20.150
That power has to be bestowed upon you

07:20.280 --> 07:22.920
by the other elders, all of whom are dead.

07:23.390 --> 07:24.460
Following my logic?

07:24.470 --> 07:25.910
How about follow your history?

07:25.910 --> 07:26.900
I did research.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.150
In 1742,

07:28.150 --> 07:29.310
there was a witch massacre

07:29.310 --> 07:30.920
that wiped out all the elders,

07:30.920 --> 07:33.920
so they decided whoever consecrated
the most powerful dead witch

07:33.920 --> 07:35.750
in the community became an elder.

07:35.800 --> 07:36.900
It worked for them.

07:36.920 --> 07:37.950
Teeny flaw.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.010
What powerful witch is
even left for you to bury?

07:43.060 --> 07:45.840
Meet Celeste Marie-Heline dubois,

07:45.880 --> 07:47.370
Elijah Mikaelson's old lover.

07:47.370 --> 07:49.970
She was drowned in 1821 for being a witch.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.620
He buried her, never told anyone where.

07:53.170 --> 07:54.730
So how the hell did you find her?

07:54.980 --> 07:56.950
I bribed Hayley to read his journals,

07:57.470 --> 07:58.890
and then I dug her ass up

07:58.890 --> 08:00.610
So I could consecrate her bones

08:01.030 --> 08:02.250
and absorb her power.

08:03.420 --> 08:05.080
That's not disrespectful.

08:05.250 --> 08:07.510
Yeah? Well, we only have
a couple more weeks

08:07.510 --> 08:08.510
to complete the harvest.

08:08.510 --> 08:10.000
Soph, I'm aware of our deadline, but--

08:10.000 --> 08:10.920
And if we fail,

08:10.920 --> 08:12.770
the witches are done for in this town.

08:13.190 --> 08:15.010
Our power will fade for good.

08:15.030 --> 08:17.870
Those girls sacrificed
will never resurrect.

08:18.180 --> 08:20.250
My niece will never come back.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.920
If digging up some creepy old
bones means i get Monique back,

08:26.670 --> 08:28.250
I don't care about anything else.

08:28.950 --> 08:30.150
I happen to care.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.299
You're coming with me.

08:42.750 --> 08:43.940
So you have stolen the remains

08:43.940 --> 08:46.580
of the very person that Davina's
been drawing for months.

08:46.580 --> 08:49.310
Would you care to explain
this startling coincidence?

08:49.920 --> 08:51.580
I can't. I didn't even know

08:51.580 --> 08:53.690
who Celeste Dubois was until I--

09:05.320 --> 09:06.260
Was that Davina?

09:06.260 --> 09:08.330
Charming little habit she's developed.

09:08.710 --> 09:10.030
And the earthquake I felt today?

09:10.080 --> 09:11.290
Also Davina,

09:11.300 --> 09:13.200
and she's taken to vomiting dirt.

09:14.650 --> 09:17.700
Oh. We have a huge problem.

09:18.700 --> 09:20.000
I thought that we had more time,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.660
but we need to complete the harvest now.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.610
Said the desperate witch conveniently.

09:25.810 --> 09:28.360
I'm serious. That earthquake you just felt

09:28.480 --> 09:31.580
a preview of the disaster movie
that is about to hit us.

09:31.580 --> 09:33.020
Why should we believe you?

09:33.050 --> 09:35.270
You've met Davina, you know her story,

09:35.430 --> 09:36.830
For months now, she's been holding

09:36.830 --> 09:39.170
all the power of the 3 girls sacrificed

09:39.180 --> 09:40.320
in the harvest ritual,

09:40.370 --> 09:42.460
A force that was meant to flow through her

09:42.520 --> 09:43.960
and back into the earth.

09:43.990 --> 09:46.870
One person was never meant
to hold that much power.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.430
It's tearing her apart,

09:49.470 --> 09:51.490
and it will take us down with it.

09:58.980 --> 10:00.090
We need to prepare.

10:00.150 --> 10:01.500
According to Sophie Deveraux,

10:01.500 --> 10:02.660
as Davina self-destructs,

10:02.660 --> 10:04.010
she'll cycle through 4 stages

10:04.010 --> 10:05.290
that represent the 4 elements

10:05.290 --> 10:06.850
that bound together the harvest.

10:06.850 --> 10:08.390
- The earthquake? - Yes.

10:09.340 --> 10:10.870
Earth stage comes first.

10:10.900 --> 10:13.120
Then comes wind, and since each stage

10:13.120 --> 10:14.390
is more intense than the last,

10:14.390 --> 10:16.590
Let's just say you'll blow
the roof off this place.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.320
The after the wind is water.

10:19.420 --> 10:21.210
Rain, flood. How bad?

10:21.440 --> 10:23.110
Quite bad actually,

10:23.540 --> 10:25.070
but that's not the worst of it.

10:25.550 --> 10:26.840
The last stage is fire,

10:27.440 --> 10:29.060
and since it's the last...

10:29.060 --> 10:31.320
It will be by far the worst.

10:31.340 --> 10:32.480
But I didn't take over this town

10:32.480 --> 10:34.070
to watch it burn to the ground.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.040
You can stop this, right?

10:36.120 --> 10:38.540
Yes, but you're not gonna like how.

10:39.630 --> 10:41.220
They want to complete the harvest.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.950
- No!
- The witches say you'll be resurrected.

10:43.950 --> 10:45.300
They're liars!

10:45.700 --> 10:47.310
They'll say anything to get what they want

10:47.310 --> 10:50.420
Just like Marcel, just like you.

10:50.420 --> 10:52.270
Davina, you may think that
I don't care about you,

10:52.270 --> 10:53.380
but you're wrong.

10:54.310 --> 10:56.450
I know what it's like to have
your life stripped away from you

10:56.450 --> 10:58.050
because of other people's bad decisions.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.670
How do you think I became a vampire?

11:02.990 --> 11:03.980
You've convinced my siblings.

11:03.980 --> 11:05.400
You have yet to convince us.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.020
We don't have time to waste.

11:07.020 --> 11:09.090
The first sign's already come and gone.

11:09.090 --> 11:10.310
So fix her.

11:10.310 --> 11:11.980
She can't be fixed.

11:13.860 --> 11:15.640
What--what is that?

11:15.640 --> 11:16.720
The more upset you become,

11:16.730 --> 11:18.320
the faster you deteriorate.

11:18.780 --> 11:20.410
I compelled up some sedative.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.190
No, no, no!

11:21.190 --> 11:22.020
We keep you calm,

11:22.020 --> 11:23.380
we keep you alive Davina.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.560
- Stop! - She can't be saved.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.780
This will not stop at the earth sign,

11:27.890 --> 11:29.280
and if you wait it out,

11:30.380 --> 11:33.430
you immortals will be the only
ones left to argue about it.

11:37.420 --> 11:38.790
No! Please!

11:39.150 --> 11:40.750
No! Please!

11:45.850 --> 11:47.170
Nooo!

11:58.570 --> 11:59.630
Convinced now?

12:33.600 --> 12:34.920
We sedated her too heavily.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.270
Well, if this is her sedated,

12:36.270 --> 12:37.790
I'd hate to see her otherwise.

12:39.340 --> 12:41.990
We all agreed that Davina
must be sacrificed.

12:41.990 --> 12:43.930
There's no need to let her
blow the roof off our heads

12:43.930 --> 12:44.850
in the meantime.

12:44.850 --> 12:46.600
No way! You're not touching her!

12:50.350 --> 12:52.550
Ok. I'll let you have that one.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.510
Marcel, no one wishes to
see Davina come to harm

12:54.510 --> 12:56.370
less than I, but there is no scenario here

12:56.370 --> 12:57.890
in which we simply wait this out.

12:57.890 --> 12:59.160
She's going to die.

12:59.620 --> 13:00.530
According to Sophie,

13:00.530 --> 13:02.020
the witch who screwed over everybody here.

13:02.020 --> 13:03.900
The harvest was working
before it was stopped.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.550
If a nonbeliever like Sophie Deveraux

13:05.550 --> 13:07.600
can come to have faith that these
girls will be resurrected,

13:07.600 --> 13:09.900
then I, also, am a believer.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.330
I saved Davina from the harvest,

13:12.330 --> 13:14.500
and now you want me to just hand her over?

13:14.500 --> 13:16.450
Do you think that I'm happy about this?

13:16.820 --> 13:18.080
If the witches complete the harvest,

13:18.080 --> 13:19.640
not only do they regain their power.

13:19.640 --> 13:21.110
We lose our weapon against them.

13:22.980 --> 13:25.270
The earthquake I was willing to chalk up

13:25.270 --> 13:26.430
to hideous coincidence,

13:26.430 --> 13:27.680
but these winds?

13:28.670 --> 13:30.030
If Davina is not sacrificed,

13:30.030 --> 13:31.980
then every inch of earth that shook,

13:31.990 --> 13:33.640
everything blowing about now

13:33.650 --> 13:35.520
will soon be drenched in water

13:35.520 --> 13:37.050
and consumed by fire.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.110
Oh! Now you care about the city.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.240
We ought to. We built it.

13:41.240 --> 13:45.060
And we all saw it burnt
to the ground twice.

13:48.330 --> 13:50.130
I will not let that happen again.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.160
Do I make myself clear?

13:54.610 --> 13:55.520
Yeah.

13:56.720 --> 13:57.750
Yeah.

14:01.220 --> 14:02.950
Not a people person, are you, Niklaus?

14:02.950 --> 14:04.320
Nonsense. I love people.

14:05.090 --> 14:07.770
Just on my way to warn a
couple of prominent ones

14:07.850 --> 14:09.450
in case the weather gets out of hand.

14:09.530 --> 14:11.600
If you fancy yourself as plus diplomatique,

14:11.610 --> 14:12.900
perhaps you'd like to come along.

14:12.900 --> 14:14.250
No. Soon Sophie Deveraux

14:14.250 --> 14:16.100
shall be consecrating Celeste's remains,

14:16.870 --> 14:18.790
and though her actions are reprehensible,

14:18.790 --> 14:20.540
still I should pay my respects.

14:20.840 --> 14:21.830
Hey. Do you have a minute?

14:21.830 --> 14:22.960
Just on my way out.

14:25.650 --> 14:27.670
Which one of us is the people person again?

14:40.740 --> 14:42.090
Fat lot of good that will do.

14:43.820 --> 14:45.520
I don't really have time to socialize.

14:45.590 --> 14:46.610
Good. Neither do I.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.080
When you're done burying your
witchy bits on sacred ground,

14:49.080 --> 14:50.930
are you prepared to perform the harvest?

14:51.010 --> 14:52.850
You do realize you have
to slit a girl's throat,

14:52.850 --> 14:54.550
a very sweet girl as it turns out.

14:54.700 --> 14:56.540
If it means I get my niece Monique back,

14:56.720 --> 14:57.860
I can handle anything.

14:59.700 --> 15:00.870
Why are you really here?

15:03.250 --> 15:04.400
When all this is done,

15:04.910 --> 15:07.180
after Davina is resurrected

15:07.180 --> 15:08.660
and the witches get their power back,

15:08.660 --> 15:10.020
You'll have a decision to make.

15:10.820 --> 15:11.800
Enlighten me.

15:12.450 --> 15:14.600
A witch at her full power
can trade body blows

15:14.600 --> 15:16.110
with a vampire punch for punch.

15:16.460 --> 15:17.560
Believe me, I know.

15:17.570 --> 15:18.690
So do I.

15:18.690 --> 15:20.320
Be nice to have a fair fight for a change.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.440
Well, fair only gets you so far, luv.

15:22.440 --> 15:24.180
Clever gets you further.

15:24.760 --> 15:26.540
After this, Marcel will still be here,

15:26.540 --> 15:27.300
and so will Klaus,

15:27.300 --> 15:27.910
and you know better than

15:27.910 --> 15:29.640
anyone that those two don't fight fair.

15:30.940 --> 15:32.950
You are going to need an
original on your side,

15:32.950 --> 15:34.170
and I'm gonna need a witch on mine

15:34.170 --> 15:35.930
if we're gonna stop those
two from running things.

15:36.780 --> 15:37.890
Am I missing something?

15:39.240 --> 15:40.340
Why would you side with me?

15:41.470 --> 15:42.760
Sometimes, what's more important

15:42.760 --> 15:44.390
is not who you're siding with

15:44.680 --> 15:46.450
but who you're siding against.

15:54.700 --> 15:55.870
No, no!

15:58.900 --> 16:01.360
Let go of me! Stop it!

16:10.270 --> 16:12.720
I got you. I got you right here.

16:16.990 --> 16:18.690
Hey. Klaus said not to.

16:20.110 --> 16:22.070
I'm done caring what Klaus says.

17:12.329 --> 17:14.109
You don't have to be here for this.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.440
It's gonna take some time

17:15.440 --> 17:17.319
for Sophie to prepare for her consecration.

17:17.650 --> 17:18.690
I have time.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.190
I owe her this.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.109
Care to elaborate why?

17:27.200 --> 17:29.000
Have you ever experienced something

17:29.670 --> 17:30.630
so...

17:32.830 --> 17:35.420
profound and wonderful that
when it was taken from you

17:35.420 --> 17:38.040
your life felt unbearable?

17:39.520 --> 17:42.130
Yes, I have felt that,

17:43.830 --> 17:45.460
and I've got the scars to prove it.

17:46.330 --> 17:47.560
I believe that when you love someone

17:47.570 --> 17:49.690
and that person loves you in return

17:49.690 --> 17:51.220
you're uniquely vulnerable.

17:52.710 --> 17:53.270
They have a power

17:53.270 --> 17:55.090
to hurt you that's like nothing else.

18:03.740 --> 18:04.370
Rebekah.

18:04.370 --> 18:05.420
He's taken the girl.

18:05.840 --> 18:06.510
Who has?

18:06.510 --> 18:08.590
Bloody, bloody Marcel!

18:08.590 --> 18:10.250
And you wanted to run off and start a life

18:10.250 --> 18:11.390
with this back stabber.

18:11.390 --> 18:12.960
Says the man who was shacking up with him

18:12.960 --> 18:14.910
not two seconds before all this went down.

18:18.780 --> 18:20.450
Ok. We need to divide and conquer

18:20.450 --> 18:21.710
if we're gonna stand a chance.

18:21.850 --> 18:22.870
He could have gone anywhere.

18:22.870 --> 18:23.900
Well, I'm here with Sabine.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.440
Perhaps we could try a locator spell?

18:26.210 --> 18:27.410
I'll talk to the priest.

18:27.420 --> 18:28.850
They might even be at the church.

18:28.860 --> 18:30.720
It's the last place we'd think
to look for them, right?

18:30.720 --> 18:31.680
Ok. You check the church,

18:31.680 --> 18:33.450
I'll check... everywhere else.

18:50.310 --> 18:51.260
What are you doing?

18:52.510 --> 18:53.860
I was gonna take these to the...

18:53.870 --> 18:55.150
If you say, "Bayou,"

18:55.320 --> 18:57.630
I will find a nice comfy
dungeon and throw you in it.

18:57.630 --> 19:00.080
This is not the night to be out there.

19:00.380 --> 19:01.450
For anyone.

19:04.350 --> 19:06.230
But some people don't have a choice.

19:09.210 --> 19:10.130
Right.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.880
Grab that lot and come with me.

19:19.210 --> 19:21.590
I consecrate these bones to the earth.

19:21.690 --> 19:23.120
Ancestors, hear me.

19:23.410 --> 19:25.780
I consecrate these bones to the earth.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.490
Ancestors, hear me.

19:42.310 --> 19:43.530
This isn't working.

19:43.710 --> 19:44.770
She's nowhere to be found.

19:44.770 --> 19:46.650
No. It's more like she's everywhere.

19:48.440 --> 19:49.920
She's hemorrhaging magic.

19:50.850 --> 19:52.270
That means we have less
time than we thought.

19:52.270 --> 19:53.260
We have got to find her.

19:53.260 --> 19:54.960
I have no clue where she is.

19:54.960 --> 19:58.020
Please concentrate.

19:58.580 --> 19:59.470
Try again.

20:19.090 --> 20:20.300
I'm not gonna hurt you.

20:20.300 --> 20:21.720
I don't believe you!

20:22.270 --> 20:24.110
You want to kill me just
like everyone else.

20:24.110 --> 20:26.100
I'm the one who put a
protection spell on you, D.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.670
That's why Tim's dead and you're not.

20:27.670 --> 20:28.960
And before you throw me again,

20:29.080 --> 20:31.560
if I had know anything was
gonna happen to your friend,

20:31.560 --> 20:32.930
I would have protected him, too.

20:35.280 --> 20:36.740
You're the one who saved me?

20:36.910 --> 20:39.310
Yeah, but now the witch who did the spell

20:39.310 --> 20:40.420
is in league with the rest of them,

20:40.420 --> 20:42.400
so I had to take you away.

20:43.100 --> 20:44.620
So you could use me as a weapon?

20:44.950 --> 20:46.630
I'm trying to keep you safe.

20:47.990 --> 20:49.770
Davina, look at me.

20:51.520 --> 20:52.480
I messed up.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.580
All this power that you have,

20:54.580 --> 20:55.950
it gave me an advantage.

20:56.410 --> 20:57.570
It helped me punish the witches,

20:57.570 --> 20:58.730
and it let me run the city,

20:58.740 --> 21:00.740
and I let that mean too much.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.710
All right, but that's over with now.

21:03.710 --> 21:05.480
One survivor to another,

21:06.450 --> 21:08.970
all I want to do is keep
you alive, I swear.

21:12.830 --> 21:14.170
I'm scared.

21:14.310 --> 21:16.280
I don't know what's wrong with me.

21:16.280 --> 21:17.740
You're not alone.

21:18.070 --> 21:19.410
We'll fix this.

21:21.110 --> 21:22.720
You won't let them hurt me?

21:22.720 --> 21:24.390
No. Nobody's gonna touch you.

21:45.530 --> 21:46.310
We still haven't gone through

21:46.310 --> 21:48.380
all that you've already provided, Klaus.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.830
Well, this newest bit isn't from me.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.860
That's very kind of you.

21:56.860 --> 21:57.870
Hayley.

21:59.260 --> 22:00.430
And these people are?

22:00.430 --> 22:02.950
I asked Father Kieran to give them shelter.

22:03.490 --> 22:06.520
He suffers from an incessant
desire to do good.

22:07.300 --> 22:09.700
But now I need you to be useful.

22:09.850 --> 22:12.030
Marcel and Davina have disappeared.

22:12.660 --> 22:14.710
I assume from the stupefied
look on your face

22:14.710 --> 22:16.660
they haven't sought refuge in your attic.

22:16.660 --> 22:18.020
No. Those days are gone.

22:18.030 --> 22:20.470
Then energize your resources.

22:20.470 --> 22:21.480
I don't need to remind you

22:21.480 --> 22:23.570
how important it is they be found.

22:23.570 --> 22:24.420
Yes.

22:30.170 --> 22:32.670
These people, they're werewolves,

22:32.670 --> 22:35.260
and the priest, he said
that you donated the food.

22:35.260 --> 22:36.500
You're helping them?

22:37.990 --> 22:39.780
They're not your werewolves.

22:39.780 --> 22:41.120
They're my clan.

22:41.450 --> 22:43.250
From very far back.

22:43.250 --> 22:45.050
They've fallen upon hard times,

22:45.050 --> 22:46.330
and their plight has brought out

22:46.330 --> 22:48.010
the philanthropist in me.

22:48.780 --> 22:49.880
What can I say?

22:50.160 --> 22:52.320
Must be Elijah's influence.

22:54.570 --> 22:56.250
What do you mean your clan?

22:56.880 --> 22:58.590
The blood that runs in their veins

22:58.590 --> 22:59.930
runs in mine.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.790
And in our child's.

23:08.430 --> 23:11.230
This family gets more
complicated by the second.

23:14.080 --> 23:16.250
Listen, Hayley,

23:16.860 --> 23:18.760
word of advice when dealing with Elijah.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.280
Don't do as I do.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.520
Just apologize.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.580
He's accomplished in many things,

23:26.580 --> 23:29.620
but he is a master of forgiveness.

23:38.260 --> 23:39.780
Ok.

23:41.720 --> 23:44.390
Oh, ok. She's somewhere near the river.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.100
I can't be more specific.

23:47.100 --> 23:48.830
It's something. It's a start.

23:49.720 --> 23:50.950
It didn't work.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.720
I tried to consecrate her

23:52.720 --> 23:53.780
and absorb her magic,

23:53.780 --> 23:56.010
but there's nothing there.

23:56.010 --> 23:57.090
I don't understand.

23:57.090 --> 23:58.510
A witch's magic is infused in her bones

23:58.510 --> 23:59.930
until consecrated.

24:00.030 --> 24:01.620
Well, then someone's already taken it

24:01.630 --> 24:03.380
because there's nothing there.

24:03.380 --> 24:04.830
Has to be another way.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.270
There is no other way.

24:06.270 --> 24:08.080
Unless you know of some superpowerful

24:08.080 --> 24:10.890
dead which whose bones
were never consecrated,

24:12.380 --> 24:13.420
it's over.

24:14.440 --> 24:16.330
There is someone else actually.

24:18.590 --> 24:19.790
My mother.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.040
It's taken 1,000 years,

24:28.040 --> 24:29.910
but you've finally gone mad.

24:30.060 --> 24:30.970
Our own mother?

24:30.970 --> 24:31.900
Yes, our beloved mother,

24:31.900 --> 24:32.700
who Niklaus has

24:32.700 --> 24:35.850
affectionately placed in a
coffin in his basement,

24:35.850 --> 24:37.650
not daggered but quite dead.

24:37.650 --> 24:39.750
Well, she did try to kill us all.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.530
Well, I say we put her to
use and put her to rest

24:41.530 --> 24:42.820
once and for all.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.860
Now if we bury our mother on land owned

24:44.860 --> 24:46.360
by one of her descendents,

24:46.360 --> 24:48.220
she becomes a New Orleans witch,

24:48.220 --> 24:51.780
and we as her family share
in that ancestral magic.

24:51.840 --> 24:52.990
We're vampires, Elijah.

24:52.990 --> 24:54.590
We can't practice magic

24:54.590 --> 24:56.570
or own property for that matter.

24:56.770 --> 24:59.040
Yes. With regard to practicing magic...

24:59.110 --> 25:00.380
That's where I come in.

25:00.380 --> 25:01.710
After they bury their mother,

25:01.710 --> 25:03.550
They can channel all her power to me.

25:03.550 --> 25:06.690
Only hitch is as conduits
of Esther's magic,

25:06.690 --> 25:08.920
they need to participate in the harvest.

25:08.920 --> 25:10.630
And as for owning property...

25:13.220 --> 25:15.480
Not all of our mother's
descendents are dead.

25:15.700 --> 25:16.830
The baby.

25:16.830 --> 25:17.970
The baby.

25:17.970 --> 25:19.550
The parish tax assessor's office

25:19.550 --> 25:21.570
is just steps outside of the quarter.

25:21.570 --> 25:24.680
Hayley now holds the
title to the plantation.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.750
So if we bury our mother there

25:26.750 --> 25:29.020
and we consecrate those grounds,

25:29.430 --> 25:31.690
we can finish the harvest ritual.

25:32.960 --> 25:35.590
You're a bit of a mad genius, Elijah.

25:36.220 --> 25:37.330
Count me in.

25:37.740 --> 25:39.350
Am I the only one thinking?

25:41.470 --> 25:44.170
Our mother was the most
powerful witch in history.

25:44.170 --> 25:45.760
If we bury her, we hand that power

25:45.770 --> 25:48.520
to our enemies to use against us.

25:48.520 --> 25:49.500
Given our circumstances,

25:49.500 --> 25:51.660
I hardly see that we
have a choice, Rebekah.

25:52.120 --> 25:53.520
I don't know why I bother.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.420
You two will just do what you want anyway.

25:55.420 --> 25:57.490
No. Our decision must be unanimous.

25:57.490 --> 25:59.270
This is not a democracy.

25:59.270 --> 26:00.490
You're quite right.

26:00.780 --> 26:02.100
This is family.

26:06.040 --> 26:10.750
Water. The next sign's begun. Rebekah?

26:14.770 --> 26:17.570
Kill a demon today, face
the devil tomorrow.

26:18.470 --> 26:19.530
Count me in.

26:20.290 --> 26:24.400
Well, this is no family
reunion without our mother.

26:24.440 --> 26:25.610
I'll fetch her.

26:29.870 --> 26:31.070
So much for your grand schemes

26:31.070 --> 26:32.660
of using Davina for revenge.

26:32.660 --> 26:34.030
Survival first,

26:34.030 --> 26:35.690
plots to overthrow my brother second.

26:35.690 --> 26:37.940
Where would Marcel hide
something precious to him?

26:38.280 --> 26:40.150
You think I'm just gonna offer that up

26:40.150 --> 26:41.730
so you can leave me here to rot?

26:41.730 --> 26:43.320
Water runs downhill.

26:43.330 --> 26:44.740
You think I have to have drowned before

26:44.740 --> 26:46.070
to know how much that will suck.

26:46.070 --> 26:48.550
Fire kills vampires, Thierry.

26:48.550 --> 26:50.800
You think burning to ash will be pleasant?

26:51.650 --> 26:53.550
Look. I am not forsaking you.

26:53.550 --> 26:56.140
I promise to live up to my end of the deal.

26:56.140 --> 26:58.410
I'll get you out of here
when all of this is done.

27:00.380 --> 27:02.630
Just tell me where Marcel would go.

27:06.090 --> 27:08.310
There's a place by the docks.

27:15.160 --> 27:17.630
If I can just wait it
out a few more weeks...

27:20.240 --> 27:21.860
Help me, please.

27:21.920 --> 27:23.710
I will, and when it's over,

27:23.710 --> 27:24.580
I'll do what I should have done--

27:24.580 --> 27:26.040
get you out of town.

27:28.620 --> 27:32.440
I had a dream that Tim wasn't dead.

27:33.990 --> 27:37.040
He played a song that he wrote for me,

27:38.810 --> 27:40.350
and he kissed me,

27:42.220 --> 27:45.010
and we were just normal.

27:47.750 --> 27:49.820
That sounds like a beautiful dream.

27:50.900 --> 27:52.220
What are you doing here?

27:53.710 --> 27:55.560
But it was just a dream.

27:55.560 --> 27:56.630
Get out!

28:07.280 --> 28:08.100
This is killing her.

28:08.100 --> 28:09.690
Your stubbornness will mean her death.

28:09.690 --> 28:10.850
I promised her I'd fight for her.

28:10.850 --> 28:12.030
I'm not breaking that promise.

28:12.030 --> 28:14.060
No one is asking you not to fight.

28:15.100 --> 28:17.430
You're the only family that this girl has.

28:17.430 --> 28:20.330
You owe it to her to fight for her to live.

28:49.230 --> 28:50.410
Did you find them?

28:52.380 --> 28:53.700
Will he bring her?

28:55.250 --> 28:56.550
He'll bring her.

29:00.850 --> 29:02.810
Are you ready to do this?

29:11.640 --> 29:13.250
Always and forever.

29:52.310 --> 29:53.500
It's done.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.020
Marcel, it's ok.

30:34.420 --> 30:37.890
No. I failed you.

30:40.190 --> 30:42.590
I'll die whether I do this or not.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.080
I mean, now the only option is--

30:45.090 --> 30:47.290
is whether I take everyone with me.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.600
If you look at it that way,

30:49.720 --> 30:51.830
it's kind of selfish not to do it.

30:53.090 --> 30:54.310
There has to be another way.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.190
This is not how it ends.

30:56.630 --> 30:57.980
And if it is...

31:00.610 --> 31:02.730
If this is all I have,

31:04.430 --> 31:06.090
I've had a lot.

31:07.390 --> 31:10.680
I had Monique, and I had Tim...

31:12.970 --> 31:14.370
And I had someone who fought for me

31:14.370 --> 31:16.460
from the moment you met me.

31:17.350 --> 31:18.640
Ah, Davina.

31:19.930 --> 31:21.340
Most people don't get that

31:21.340 --> 31:23.610
even if they live to be 100.

31:28.250 --> 31:29.780
Marcel, I'm ready.

31:51.970 --> 31:52.920
Fire.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.880
Do you believe in the harvest?

32:25.680 --> 32:26.860
I believe.

33:32.310 --> 33:35.160
After the harvest comes the reaping.

33:36.100 --> 33:39.210
Their sacrifices made and accepted,

33:39.620 --> 33:41.470
we call upon our elders

33:41.740 --> 33:44.010
to resurrect your chosen ones.

33:57.630 --> 33:59.690
We call upon our elders

33:59.960 --> 34:02.380
to resurrect your chosen ones.

34:08.300 --> 34:10.360
Resurrect your chosen ones.

34:16.420 --> 34:17.409
Please.

34:18.980 --> 34:20.090
I beg.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.260
That won't bring her back, you know?

35:15.260 --> 35:16.810
This is your fault.

35:16.910 --> 35:19.200
I should have never let
you anywhere near her.

35:19.360 --> 35:20.260
Marcel--

35:20.260 --> 35:22.590
This city was fine before you came.

35:22.590 --> 35:24.040
We were fine!

35:24.040 --> 35:26.750
Davina was safe! She was in control!

35:26.750 --> 35:28.300
If you hadn't gotten her worked up,

35:28.300 --> 35:29.820
if you hadn't killed that boy!

35:29.820 --> 35:31.780
My condolences the girl is gone,

35:31.780 --> 35:33.170
but don't lose perspective.

35:33.170 --> 35:34.500
We still have our community.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.640
The vampires of this town--

35:35.640 --> 35:39.340
I don't care about the vampires!

35:39.340 --> 35:40.890
She is dead!

35:41.890 --> 35:43.480
Do you hear me?

35:51.670 --> 35:52.690
I'm sorry.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.420
You may think I know nothing of your grief,

35:56.420 --> 35:57.880
but you are wrong.

36:03.060 --> 36:05.600
In the days after I fled this city,

36:06.180 --> 36:07.810
I thought you were dead.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.880
It was years before I could speak your name

36:10.890 --> 36:14.000
so keenly did I feel that loss.

36:15.960 --> 36:16.950
I'm sorry.

36:19.730 --> 36:21.150
I'm--I'm sorry.

36:29.140 --> 36:30.760
Are you ready to forgive me yet?

36:30.760 --> 36:32.520
It's not that easy, Hayley.

36:33.590 --> 36:36.330
Elijah, I was wrong to go
through your journals,

36:36.330 --> 36:40.250
I was wrong to tell Sophie about Celeste,

36:40.370 --> 36:42.820
but after everything that happened today,

36:43.070 --> 36:45.400
I don't know why we can't see past this.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.250
And you of all people should know why.

36:48.560 --> 36:49.860
During my fever in the bayou,

36:49.860 --> 36:51.920
you were inside my mind.

36:51.920 --> 36:54.020
You know what Celeste means to me.

36:54.020 --> 36:55.140
Don't you mean meant to you?

36:55.140 --> 36:59.660
No. Do you have any idea how rare love is?

37:00.800 --> 37:03.090
In a thousand years, I
have found it but twice,

37:03.090 --> 37:05.520
and when I have, I have honored it.

37:07.080 --> 37:10.120
I know what a promise means to you, Elijah,

37:11.580 --> 37:14.310
but you made it 200 years ago.

37:15.330 --> 37:16.960
I live in the now.

37:17.290 --> 37:18.880
If I feel something,

37:18.880 --> 37:19.730
I act.

37:19.740 --> 37:22.830
If I want something, I take it.

37:23.520 --> 37:25.870
I won't choose the dead over the living,

37:25.870 --> 37:27.430
so why are you?

37:33.970 --> 37:35.690
I'm sorry, Elijah.

38:17.140 --> 38:18.390
This whole thing was doomed

38:18.390 --> 38:20.040
from the start, you know?

38:20.540 --> 38:22.640
Yes, we saved the city,

38:22.850 --> 38:24.470
and I'm not complaining about the witches

38:24.470 --> 38:25.690
losing their power,

38:25.690 --> 38:28.390
but this did not go down the
way I thought it would.

38:34.070 --> 38:35.750
You surprised me, though.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.110
You were quite resourceful today.

38:38.130 --> 38:40.690
How did you find them down at the docks?

38:41.780 --> 38:43.900
You're not the only one
with clever little spies

38:43.900 --> 38:45.260
in the quarter, Nik.

38:48.350 --> 38:51.910
Sometimes I think I don't give
you your due, little sister.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.750
I knew Elijah's plan was mad,

38:59.750 --> 39:03.370
but I really thought it would work.

39:04.450 --> 39:05.690
So did I.

39:07.230 --> 39:09.580
I was sure Davina would survive.

39:10.120 --> 39:12.040
There was so much life in her.

39:17.090 --> 39:18.500
What about the power?

39:21.010 --> 39:23.600
4 were supposed to rise, and none did.

39:28.030 --> 39:29.800
Where did all that power go?

41:10.950 --> 41:12.450
Why are we here?

41:12.450 --> 41:14.190
Someone brought us forth.

41:14.800 --> 41:15.680
Who?

41:16.780 --> 41:17.760
I did.

41:21.500 --> 41:25.030
Sabine! What's the meaning of this?

41:25.030 --> 41:26.730
Bastiana, I've had to endure people

41:26.730 --> 41:29.300
calling me "Sabine" for almost a year now.

41:30.870 --> 41:32.000
I'd appreciate it if you'd call me

41:32.000 --> 41:33.400
by my real name--

41:34.760 --> 41:36.160
Celeste.
