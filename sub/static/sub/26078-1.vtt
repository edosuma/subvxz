telling me something.

when it's mentioned.

can you tell me about
the history of this abbey?

It was built by a duke
in the Dark Ages.

<i>The Duke of Saint Carta.</i>

50:44.600 --> 50:48.202
<i>He wrote countless texts
on witchcraft and rituals,</i>

50:48.204 --> 50:51.439
in which to call upon
the forces of hell.

50:51.441 --> 50:54.241
Hell used him
to open a gateway

50:54.243 --> 50:55.642
so that an unspeakable evil

50:55.644 --> 50:57.213
<i>would walk amongst us.</i>

50:58.247 --> 50:59.983
(RUMBLING)

51:12.094 --> 51:14.129
<i>But the Church
stormed the castle.</i>

51:19.167 --> 51:23.635
They sealed the gateway
using an ancient relic

51:23.637 --> 51:26.141
<i>containing the blood
of Jesus Christ.</i>

51:30.811 --> 51:32.978
<i>The Church claimed the castle
for their own</i>

51:32.980 --> 51:34.913
<i>and our perpetual
praying began</i>

51:34.915 --> 51:37.883
<i>to secure the abbey
and contain the evil.</i>

51:37.885 --> 51:42.755
<i>For centuries it worked
and evil was kept at bay</i>

51:42.757 --> 51:46.392
<i>until the bombs of war
shook the abbey</i>

51:46.394 --> 51:50.661
and evil found another way
to open the gateway.

51:50.663 --> 51:54.699
Sister Oana,
last night in the chapel,

51:54.701 --> 51:55.902
I saw a nun.

51:57.271 --> 52:02.542
She was...
She felt anything but holy.

52:03.543 --> 52:04.878

the hallways at night.

52:09.349 --> 52:11.315
<i>We all have.</i>

52:11.317 --> 52:14.318
<i>She looks like us,
but she's not one of us.</i>

52:14.320 --> 52:15.920
It's something unholy.

52:15.922 --> 52:18.022
It takes on different forms
to deceive us

52:18.024 --> 52:19.623
and prey on our weaknesses.

52:19.625 --> 52:21.925
It appears as a nun so it can
hide among our cloister

52:21.927 --> 52:24.162
<i>until it can corrupt us all.</i>

52:24.164 --> 52:27.964
I fear her presence means
the portal has opened again.
