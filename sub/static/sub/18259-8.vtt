14:27.227 --> 14:30.029
Please. Please, I’ve already had
two visions this morning.

14:30.030 --> 14:31.911
The first one was a melting rose

14:31.912 --> 14:33.192
that turned into blood
all over my hands,

14:33.193 --> 14:34.594
the second,
I was in an alleyway,

14:34.595 --> 14:36.556
and I felt like
I was being buried alive.

14:36.557 --> 14:38.678
I couldn’t breathe.

14:38.679 --> 14:40.239
I don’t know where else to go.

14:40.240 --> 14:43.242
You’re...
You’re the only person I trust.

14:43.243 --> 14:45.245
Please, I need your help.

14:51.131 --> 14:53.573
- Okay. First of all,
I want to say I’m sorry.

14:53.574 --> 14:54.734
They messed up
my breakfast scramble

14:54.735 --> 14:56.135
this morning at the Farmshop,

14:56.136 --> 14:57.777
and I thought
I was having a bad day.

14:57.778 --> 15:00.099
Second of all, you’re still
my patient, apparently,

15:00.100 --> 15:01.901
and I want to help you,
I really do.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.703
But I have done everything

15:03.704 --> 15:05.424
that I possibly can
for you medically,

15:05.425 --> 15:08.588
and I don’t... I don’t...

15:08.589 --> 15:09.909
I don’t know
how to make them stop.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.391
-I don’t want them to stop.

15:12.392 --> 15:14.794
You said it yourself,
acceptance, not denial.

15:14.795 --> 15:16.796
I accept.
I accept the fact

15:16.797 --> 15:18.157
that something is happening

15:18.158 --> 15:19.959
in my head,
so I’m gonna double down.

let’s go, let’s talk.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.446
I’m ready to have
a conversation with them.

15:27.447 --> 15:28.848
- So you want to open
the pathway?

15:28.849 --> 15:31.250
- I want to know what
all of this means.

15:31.251 --> 15:35.135
No more fragments, no snippets.
I want the whole picture.

- Laurie, your assistant,
where is she?

16:37.357 --> 16:39.279
-Oh, Laurie!

16:43.203 --> 16:45.526
She told me to tell you
no hard feelings.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.775

16:58.378 --> 17:00.541
I’m running late. Thanks.

17:03.343 --> 17:05.384
- So I think what’s happening
when you have these visions

17:05.385 --> 17:07.587
is your body releases
two hormones,

17:07.588 --> 17:11.069
adrenaline, which triggers
your fight-or-flight response,

17:11.070 --> 17:13.071
and cortisol,
which makes your body shut down

17:13.073 --> 17:14.433
any unnecessary functions.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.915
So I think that your body

17:15.915 --> 17:17.877
is seeing these visions
as a threat,

17:17.877 --> 17:21.040
so we just need to relax it
and let 'em in.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.521
-What is that?

17:22.522 --> 17:24.123
- Oh, that’s Moor mud
and activated charcoal.

17:24.124 --> 17:26.165
The charcoal is gonna
help balance your pH

17:26.165 --> 17:27.527
so that your brain
doesn’t freak out

17:27.528 --> 17:28.848
and flood your system
with hormones,

17:28.849 --> 17:30.650
and then the mud is gonna,
hopefully,

17:30.651 --> 17:34.294
absorb any excess hydrogen ion
concentration in your cells.

17:37.097 --> 17:38.778
You said that you
wanted to do this.

17:38.779 --> 17:40.700
You’re in limbo,
and you can’t stop it...

17:40.701 --> 17:42.261
Right, okay.

17:42.262 --> 17:45.825
Good.

17:45.826 --> 17:48.828
So just get as deep
into the tub as you can.

17:48.829 --> 17:51.911
We want maximum exposure
to your skin, okay?

17:51.912 --> 17:53.953
So...

17:53.954 --> 17:55.555
I am just gonna be over here,

17:55.556 --> 17:56.916
and if at any point,
you want to stop,

17:56.917 --> 17:58.598
you just give a shout.

17:58.599 --> 17:59.919
All right?

17:59.920 --> 18:02.242
You good? Okay.

18:20.460 --> 18:22.261

19:42.943 --> 19:44.744
-I need you to stay right here.

Don’t talk to anyone, don’t go
anywhere, just wait for me.

the funny one

20:18.899 --> 20:20.900
that kept us awake all night.

how we used to complain

20:22.783 --> 20:25.264
all those freezing morning
on swim team.

20:25.265 --> 20:27.627
And I’ll never forget the time
on eighth grade retreat

20:27.628 --> 20:30.269
when you filled Mr. Connolly´s
canteen with pickle juice

20:30.270 --> 20:31.831
and told him it was water.

20:31.832 --> 20:34.715

when he drank it.

would be fair,

and you’re gonna do
the mongli mous.

30:52.533 --> 30:54.934
Come on, Fonso.

30:54.935 --> 30:56.537
Do it for the family.

31:05.986 --> 31:07.227
-Yes.

31:27.928 --> 31:30.410
What is the asking price?

31:35.015 --> 31:36.696
Fonso, I need to know
how much you are...

31:36.697 --> 31:38.257
-$10,000.

31:38.258 --> 31:40.179
- What?
- No girl in L. A.

31:40.180 --> 31:42.782
Has ever gotten
more than $6,000.

31:42.783 --> 31:45.265
- This is my daughter,
it’s $10,000.

31:52.553 --> 31:56.636
I’ll kick back $2,000
at the wedding.

31:56.637 --> 31:59.159
To our contribution.

32:04.925 --> 32:06.607
- If we tell him there
won’t be more...

32:09.730 --> 32:10.850
-Okay.

32:10.851 --> 32:13.973
Well...

32:13.974 --> 32:16.456
it’s a deal!

32:27.467 --> 32:30.349
-You said it was over.

32:30.350 --> 32:31.831
You sat in that seat
right there,

32:31.832 --> 32:35.715
and you said it was done
between you and Gina.

32:35.716 --> 32:39.078
- I thought we were.
- One rule.

32:39.079 --> 32:42.001
That’s all we had.

32:42.002 --> 32:45.164
And you know what I think
hurts you the most?

32:45.165 --> 32:48.288
You got taken.
You were the mark.

33:18.519 --> 33:20.480
-Oh, God.

33:23.363 --> 33:25.925
-Who would have thought...

33:25.926 --> 33:29.448
the two of us,
back where we met.

33:29.449 --> 33:32.852
- Are you following me?
- Hmm.

33:32.853 --> 33:38.097
Fonso asked me to keep an eye
on all of Charlie's family.

33:38.098 --> 33:40.541
What’s in the can?

33:44.545 --> 33:46.345
-Coffee.

33:46.346 --> 33:49.109
- The next thing you say
needs to be the truth.

33:54.515 --> 33:57.276
- $12,000 cash,
a bunch of cursed earrings

33:57.277 --> 34:01.280
I could pawn for triple that.

34:01.281 --> 34:04.443
-Why don’t you let me have that?

34:04.444 --> 34:05.845
- Why don’t I kick you
in the balls

34:05.846 --> 34:07.046
and run out
that door screaming "rape,"

34:07.047 --> 34:09.530
see how that goes for you?

34:13.213 --> 34:14.813
Seriously?

34:14.815 --> 34:16.577
You’d do that to me
after yesterday?

34:19.259 --> 34:21.101
- You got a better way
to handle things?

34:23.664 --> 34:26.706
- We could take this money
and that...

34:26.706 --> 34:30.150
big gypsy dick of yours
and hop a flight to Vegas.

34:32.632 --> 34:36.315
No one needs to know.

34:36.315 --> 34:38.797
Unless...

34:38.799 --> 34:40.719
-Unless what?

34:40.721 --> 34:42.241
- Unless being
under Fonso's thumb

34:42.242 --> 34:44.764
and beating up girls
and taking their money

34:44.764 --> 34:46.647
to that bitch Rita
is your thing.

34:49.929 --> 34:51.692
In which case...

34:55.616 --> 35:00.179
- You stole what’s in that can
from your own brother.

35:00.180 --> 35:02.902
You sure you’re not Roma?

35:02.903 --> 35:04.624
-[ Chuckling ]

35:04.625 --> 35:08.108
-I fucking love Vegas.

35:11.952 --> 35:14.273
We'll go.

35:14.274 --> 35:15.956
But if you fuck me over...

35:19.159 --> 35:21.961
I am gonna carve
the rest of the alphabet

35:21.962 --> 35:24.805
on what’s left of that
pretty little face of yours.

35:31.652 --> 35:33.574
-You’re so romantic.

35:54.194 --> 35:57.356
- A gift from the groom
to the bride.

35:57.357 --> 35:58.998
18 karats.

35:58.999 --> 36:01.440
Little T chose
the necklace himself.

36:01.441 --> 36:03.883
The kid has got an eye like
Estée Lauder, I’m telling you.

36:03.884 --> 36:07.006
Okay. Who doesn’t have one?

36:07.007 --> 36:08.689
It’s time.

36:10.210 --> 36:14.053
-Oh!

36:14.054 --> 36:15.414
Bah!

36:15.415 --> 36:16.455
- Good health,
good luck to your family.

36:16.456 --> 36:17.537
Sasti!

36:17.538 --> 36:21.021
- Sasti masa!
- Sasti masa!

36:23.904 --> 36:25.505
-Sorry.

36:25.506 --> 36:27.026
- This is not for gadjo,
it is a family affair.

36:27.027 --> 36:29.669
- I don’t mean to interfere,
I’m sorry.

36:29.670 --> 36:32.471
I’m sorry, I apologize.
- What are they doing here?

36:32.472 --> 36:34.073
-I don’t mean to intrude.

36:34.074 --> 36:35.995
I’m sorry, I just...
- We’re just looking for our son.

36:35.996 --> 36:38.558
-Fonso, please.

36:38.559 --> 36:42.041
-Concerned parents, huh?

36:42.042 --> 36:43.282
-Whoa, hey, hey, hey!

36:43.283 --> 36:44.884
- Please!
- Is my son here?

36:44.885 --> 36:47.727
- Oh, you think he’s here?
- Yeah. Just tell me where he is!

36:47.728 --> 36:50.449
- Or what? I don’t give a fuck
about your fucked-up son!

36:50.450 --> 36:52.091
-Do you have him?

36:52.092 --> 36:55.576
-Maybe I do. Maybe I don’t.

37:08.148 --> 37:11.872
- You’re a dead man!
- Stop it! Stop!

37:15.556 --> 37:18.037
- Get off of me!
- Fonso!

37:18.038 --> 37:19.519
- He might be your property,
but this is my home, eh!

37:19.520 --> 37:22.602
I’ll handle this!
Dosta! Dosta!

37:22.603 --> 37:24.924
Stop, stop!

37:24.925 --> 37:26.485
Take him back! Take him back!

37:26.486 --> 37:27.887
-Fucking dead man walking!

37:27.888 --> 37:30.690
-Come on!

37:30.691 --> 37:32.451
Stop him!
- Get off me!

37:32.452 --> 37:33.813
-Dosta, dosta!

37:33.814 --> 37:35.174
-You damage my property,

37:35.175 --> 37:36.415
I’ll blackball your whole
fucking family!

37:36.416 --> 37:37.937
-Fonso, it’s not worth it!

37:37.938 --> 37:39.780
Go sit down!
Take him back!

37:42.583 --> 37:45.706
Fonso, stop it!
Dosta! Dosta!

37:48.709 --> 37:50.110
- You want to go
against the Kris?

37:56.597 --> 37:59.119
- I know where Nick is.
- Dosta!

38:21.501 --> 38:26.025
- I don’t understand!
He’s supposed to be in here!

38:26.026 --> 38:28.589
-Charlie.

38:30.470 --> 38:33.873
-Rose Construction. Roses.

38:33.874 --> 38:35.795
Surrounded by dirt.

38:35.796 --> 38:38.678
That’s what I thought
the vision was telling me.

38:38.679 --> 38:40.039
-Vision?

38:40.040 --> 38:42.081
Do you hear yourself?

38:42.082 --> 38:48.167
- I know it sounds crazy,
but I’m having these visions.

38:48.168 --> 38:50.009
Now...

38:50.010 --> 38:53.372
I understand better than most
that what we do is bullshit.

38:53.373 --> 38:55.535
It is make believe
and we con people

38:55.536 --> 38:58.177
out of their fucking money.

38:58.178 --> 39:00.020
But then I got this...

39:04.384 --> 39:08.187
I can see the future, Linda.

39:08.188 --> 39:10.189
I saw Nick.

39:10.190 --> 39:12.431
He was under...

39:12.432 --> 39:15.996
dirt, surrounded by...

39:18.198 --> 39:19.398
[ Cellphone ringing ]

39:19.399 --> 39:20.681
He’s here!

39:22.723 --> 39:26.365
-Hello.

39:26.366 --> 39:28.889
Yes. I am his mother.

39:43.103 --> 39:45.585
- Your boy and two friends
were up in the woods.

39:45.586 --> 39:47.867
Booze, weed.

39:47.868 --> 39:50.229
We’re leaving it at minor
in possession.

39:50.230 --> 39:52.231
There'll be a court date
and a fine.

39:52.232 --> 39:53.753
-The woods?

39:53.754 --> 39:55.956
- Yeah, where they found
the Gilbert girl.

40:01.602 --> 40:03.604
-Come on.

40:18.298 --> 40:20.419
-Are you gonna say anything?

40:20.420 --> 40:21.622
-I’m just glad he’s okay.

40:34.875 --> 40:38.477
-Nick’s asleep.

40:38.478 --> 40:39.640
-Okay.

40:43.964 --> 40:46.607
You think I’m crazy.

40:50.811 --> 40:54.013
-I think...

40:54.014 --> 40:56.256
that you have been
through a lot lately.

40:59.820 --> 41:02.101
And if I’m being honest
with myself,

41:02.102 --> 41:04.585
I think it’s because of me.

41:06.667 --> 41:10.510
I’m sorry about Gina.

41:10.511 --> 41:12.312
I don’t know what else to say.

41:28.689 --> 41:30.010
What’s wrong?

41:56.717 --> 42:00.199
Charlie?

42:00.200 --> 42:02.723
What are you doing?

42:59.339 --> 43:03.342
-♫ It’s time to say goodbye ♫

43:03.343 --> 43:06.425
