00:09.857 --> 00:12.191
two brothers,
max and tommy davis

00:12.193 --> 00:15.528
have been reported missing
from the town of walstrom.

00:15.530 --> 00:18.698
The boys' mother says they were last
seen around 1:00 in the afternoon.

00:18.700 --> 00:22.201
She tells police the two were playing
outside in the neighborhood,

00:22.203 --> 00:24.941
but they did not return
home that afternoon.

00:27.209 --> 00:28.575
While searching
for the boys,

00:28.577 --> 00:30.509
the mother discovered
max's shoes

00:30.511 --> 00:31.912
with blood on them.

00:31.914 --> 00:34.079
That's when she contacted
local authorities.

00:34.081 --> 00:37.116
- Have
you called your family, friends?

00:37.118 --> 00:40.887
Everyone. I've called
everyone, and i've been everywhere,

00:40.889 --> 00:43.022
and no one has seen
or heard from them.

00:43.024 --> 00:45.658
...and as you can see,
the town has rallied together

00:45.660 --> 00:48.195
to help search for the two missing davis brothers.

00:48.197 --> 00:51.064
It has been near 48 hours since
the boys were reported missing

00:51.066 --> 00:52.966
and authorities
still have no leads.

00:52.968 --> 00:56.036
If you have any information
to help the investigation,

00:56.038 --> 00:58.238
please contact the walstrom
police department,

00:58.240 --> 01:01.875
- or reach out to our...
- do they have any distinguishing marks,

01:01.877 --> 01:05.846
scars, birth marks, anything we
can use to identify them with?

01:05.848 --> 01:08.081
And do you remember
what they were wearing?

01:08.083 --> 01:12.718
Max, always wears his father's dog
tag, it's all he has left of him.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.186
So he wears them
wherever he goes.

01:14.188 --> 01:16.122
This just in,
we received an update

01:16.124 --> 01:17.823
regarding the missing
davis boys.

01:17.825 --> 01:20.060
A torn piece of fabric
of tommy davis'

01:20.062 --> 01:22.596
was found several miles
from the family home,

01:22.598 --> 01:23.763
leading police
and investigators

01:23.765 --> 01:25.632
to suspect potential
foul play.

01:25.634 --> 01:28.034
Tommy has a
little scar on his left knee.

01:28.036 --> 01:30.637
- I don't know if he'll come home.
- The search perimeter

01:30.639 --> 01:32.539
has been expanded
to the neighboring county,

01:32.541 --> 01:34.206
and police have begun questioning
persons of interest,

01:34.208 --> 01:35.808
but no arrests
have been made.

01:35.810 --> 01:37.543
The community and all the
members of the force

01:37.545 --> 01:39.111
are on the look out
for the boys.

01:39.113 --> 01:41.114
It's been a
massive group effort.

01:41.116 --> 01:43.185
I'm positive we'll have
results shortly.

02:02.803 --> 02:04.236
What?

02:04.238 --> 02:06.272
Look up there.

02:06.274 --> 02:10.880
- Is that a light?
- You've got to be kidding me.

02:45.113 --> 02:47.314
Hmm. I doubt they're here.

02:47.316 --> 02:49.349
Those kids would need
balls of steel

02:49.351 --> 02:52.851
to go into a place like
this by themselves.

02:52.853 --> 02:54.720
Yeah.

02:54.722 --> 02:56.723
And nobody's supposed
to be here anyway.

02:56.725 --> 02:58.291
It's worth checking out.

02:58.293 --> 02:59.829
Hmm.

03:29.858 --> 03:31.992
Hey, when was this place
last running?

03:31.994 --> 03:34.830
I'm not sure.
It's been a while.

03:42.204 --> 03:46.142
How could two 10-year-olds
get into a place like this?

03:50.978 --> 03:52.781
The front door.

04:22.677 --> 04:26.715
This is the police.
Is anyone inside?

05:44.159 --> 05:46.295
Max! Tommy!

06:05.547 --> 06:08.484
The filament,
it's broken.

06:09.984 --> 06:12.285
Ditch the bulb.
If the boys are here,

06:12.287 --> 06:14.287
we won't be able
to find them alone.

06:14.289 --> 06:15.788
The building's too big.

06:15.790 --> 06:17.926
We need more bodies.

06:50.424 --> 06:53.128
Did you...
did you here that?...

06:58.866 --> 06:59.398
what the...

07:16.852 --> 07:18.884
the car's almost packed.

07:18.886 --> 07:21.020
How did you hear
about this place again?

07:21.022 --> 07:23.288
- They called me.
- Called you?

07:23.290 --> 07:26.059
Nobody calls you. I don't even
call you when i like you.

07:26.061 --> 07:27.927
- Why would a place like this...
- call me?

07:27.929 --> 07:29.629
To do an investigation.

07:29.631 --> 07:31.129
Dude, are you really
gonna complain?

07:31.131 --> 07:32.631
This is a legit gig.

07:32.633 --> 07:34.533
I had to cancel
that brown one for this,

07:34.535 --> 07:36.401
and we're getting paid
good money for this.

07:36.403 --> 07:39.239
Yeah, then comes your own show
on the travel channel.

07:39.241 --> 07:41.407
And then the fame,
and then rehab,

07:41.409 --> 07:42.908
and then "dancing
with the stars",

07:42.910 --> 07:44.544
and then rehab again.

07:44.546 --> 07:47.213
And then "where are they now?"
Followed by some more rehab.

07:47.215 --> 07:51.016
Man, i know you're joking,
but i'm cool with that plan.

07:51.018 --> 07:52.518
Are shane and nicky
on the way?

07:52.520 --> 07:54.052
Yup, we also got
a journalist.

07:54.054 --> 07:55.554
What? Why?

07:55.556 --> 07:57.590
Works at some blog
and he's writing about us.

07:57.592 --> 08:00.626
Not gonna say no
to free press.

08:02.898 --> 08:04.997
Hi mom.

08:10.071 --> 08:12.537
You guys seem to be taking
this one pretty seriously.

08:12.539 --> 08:15.307
I understand that. I will
clean it up when i get home.

08:15.309 --> 08:18.011
I'm busy.
Listen i'm...

08:18.013 --> 08:19.978
you're going on
another ghost hunt.

08:19.980 --> 08:22.215
Well, you know how much
we're getting paid for this.

08:22.217 --> 08:24.984
Well, i'm sorry i wasn't as good
at football as you'd hoped.

08:24.986 --> 08:26.451
- 20,000, right?
- Yeah.

08:26.453 --> 08:28.687
Sounds a little
too good to be true.

08:28.689 --> 08:31.290
But you don't just pick up
the ball and throw it,

08:31.292 --> 08:33.159
there's a lot more
that goes into it.

08:33.160 --> 08:34.693
I read about it
in a book!

08:34.696 --> 08:37.130
- Seriously? Now?
- What?

08:37.131 --> 08:39.232
And you finally got a job
that pays well,

08:39.234 --> 08:41.099
and you still got
a problem with it.

08:41.101 --> 08:43.336
- Here.
- What's this?

08:43.337 --> 08:44.938
It's all the information,
i could find

08:44.940 --> 08:46.342
on this hospital.

08:55.050 --> 08:58.050
So, what do you think is gonna happen?
Do you think you're gonna

08:58.052 --> 09:00.319
walk in there, see some
ghosts, and get paid?

09:00.321 --> 09:02.722
Why don't you tell me
what you'd like to see happen.

09:02.724 --> 09:06.258
I'd rather see you get a real job and
quit with all this ghost bullshit.

09:06.260 --> 09:08.493
You're gonna have to move out eventually,
and you can't afford to do that,

09:08.495 --> 09:10.530
if you're wasting
all your time with this crap.

09:10.532 --> 09:13.201
Well, then maybe you
should have had a daughter!

09:16.738 --> 09:19.508
Okay, goodbye, mom.

09:26.281 --> 09:31.284
- Thanks.
- Hey.

09:31.286 --> 09:33.051
I'm going to finish
loading up.

09:33.053 --> 09:36.088
Damn, i wanted to see
another conner mom breakout!

09:36.090 --> 09:37.292
Bite me.

09:38.493 --> 09:40.993
Make sure you don't
forget anything.

09:40.995 --> 09:43.128
Have i ever
forgotten anything?

09:43.130 --> 09:46.399
- Nope.
- Then don't worry about it.

09:46.401 --> 09:49.068
Be nice to him.

09:49.070 --> 09:50.737
- Come on, we're just playing around.
- He's fine.

09:50.739 --> 09:53.006
Always great when you
call me, isn't it?

09:53.008 --> 09:54.640
Always tell me about
my cousin daryl.

09:54.642 --> 09:57.075
"Daryl plays football.
Daryl's got a girlfriend."

09:57.077 --> 09:59.312
Well, you know what, mom?
It's hard to play football

09:59.314 --> 10:01.280
when you have
dancer's legs!

10:01.282 --> 10:05.083
I swear to god, if you call me like
this, just one of these days...

10:05.085 --> 10:07.053
one of these days
i'm just gonna snap.

10:07.055 --> 10:09.488
I'm gonna be like, oh yeah,
conner's so cool right now,

10:09.490 --> 10:11.156
conner's such a nice son.

10:11.158 --> 10:13.126
No, conner's snapping,
because i don't wanna hear

10:13.128 --> 10:14.964
about playing
football anymore.

10:31.111 --> 10:34.079
I'm sick of hearing it. I don't
care what aunt carol says.

10:34.081 --> 10:38.083
- I...
- are your richard, by any chance?

10:38.085 --> 10:39.718
- What?
- The paranormal guy.

10:39.720 --> 10:43.256
No, he's inside.
He'll be out in a sec.

10:43.258 --> 10:46.324
You say that one more time...

10:46.326 --> 10:48.361
- shane, that's just gonna piss him off.
- I know!

10:48.363 --> 10:50.328
I know!

10:50.330 --> 10:53.131
- Rich said you were gonna forget this.
- God damn it!

10:53.133 --> 10:56.368
I didn't forget it. I was just
about to go inside and get that.

10:56.370 --> 10:58.139
Of course you were.

11:00.108 --> 11:05.178
Listen, i'm not trying to be
too hard on you or anything,

11:05.180 --> 11:07.814
i'm glad to see you're
passionate about what you do.

11:07.816 --> 11:10.183
- Okay.
- I'm just worried about you.

11:10.185 --> 11:13.553
I don't wanna see you rely too heavily
on something and then have it fail.

11:13.555 --> 11:15.454
Especially since you record
everything you do.

11:15.456 --> 11:19.227
I... i don't want to see you
get disappointed or hurt.

11:22.529 --> 11:24.729
Just be careful.

11:24.731 --> 11:28.434
Okay? I've got the nightshift
tonight, so i won't be at the house.

11:28.436 --> 11:32.137
If anything happens, it'll be
hard to get a hold of me.

11:32.139 --> 11:34.506
I'll be fine.

11:34.508 --> 11:37.712
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:39.580 --> 11:41.713
- Are you zak?
- Yeah.

11:41.715 --> 11:43.882
- Rich, nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

11:43.884 --> 11:45.785
So, what are you writing
this for anyway?

11:45.787 --> 11:48.221
Oh, i work for a blog
called, "you heard it."

11:48.223 --> 11:49.889
Every year we do a killer
halloween piece

11:49.891 --> 11:52.125
and this year we decided
to focus on you.

11:52.127 --> 11:53.758
People seem to buy
into this bullshit.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.628
We lucked out finding
you guys were local.

11:56.630 --> 11:59.698
To be honest, you're a lot
younger than i expected.

11:59.700 --> 12:01.501
Is this an actual job?

12:01.503 --> 12:03.169
For now.

12:03.171 --> 12:05.170
All right, everything's
packed up.

12:05.172 --> 12:07.740
- Even the tripod?
- Yes, even the fucking tripod.

12:07.742 --> 12:10.376
- I was going to get it.
- All right, let's head out.

12:10.378 --> 12:12.444
Ah, zak, there's not
enough room in this car,

12:12.446 --> 12:14.313
why don't you ride
on over with nicky.

12:14.315 --> 12:15.551
Gladly.

12:20.687 --> 12:23.389
I'm not even
gonna say it,

12:23.391 --> 12:25.790
but you get my drift.

12:25.792 --> 12:27.392
Ah, that's cute.

12:27.394 --> 12:29.428
If you're gonna do
the whole tough guy thing,

12:29.430 --> 12:32.198
you've got to work
on the intimidating banter,

12:32.200 --> 12:35.568
otherwise it just
falls flat.

12:35.570 --> 12:37.672
Try that.

12:41.341 --> 12:43.775
What do you guys wanna do
with the new guy?

12:43.777 --> 12:46.545
Go stick him with someone
and have him observe.

12:46.547 --> 12:48.680
No, i don't trust him
with nicky.

12:48.682 --> 12:50.382
You don't trust
anyone with her.

12:50.384 --> 12:53.285
That's very true.

12:53.287 --> 12:56.856
He better not try
to mess with me.

12:56.858 --> 12:58.623
What?

12:58.625 --> 13:01.227
You got in one fight where
you sucker punched a dude,

13:01.229 --> 13:03.795
- and all of a sudden you're mr. Tough guy.
- Oh, i'm sorry,

13:03.797 --> 13:05.665
- have you ever been in a fight?
- No.

13:05.667 --> 13:06.966
Then shut up!

13:06.968 --> 13:09.868
So, do you believe
in ghosts and stuff?

13:09.870 --> 13:12.204
Is that a serious question?

13:12.206 --> 13:15.407
Don't worry, i'm not gonna reveal
all your secrets in the article.

13:15.409 --> 13:20.346
But seriously, what do you guys
use, fishing line, photo shop?

13:20.348 --> 13:22.381
You've been with us
all of five minutes,

13:22.383 --> 13:24.784
and you've already figured out
all of our dirty little secrets.

13:24.786 --> 13:26.452
I'm impressed.

13:26.454 --> 13:29.988
I mean, i'm open to the idea,
it could be real.

13:29.990 --> 13:32.592
I've just never
seen it before.

13:32.594 --> 13:37.229
But who knows, maybe tonight
can be kind of special.

13:37.231 --> 13:39.598
Hey, you can stop trying
so hard to impress me.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.602
- You can quit the act.
- Oh, have i been that obvious?

13:42.604 --> 13:44.303
- A little.

13:44.305 --> 13:46.973
Duly noted, don't try
to impress.

13:46.975 --> 13:48.708
Got it.

13:48.710 --> 13:50.943
So has a ghost ever tried
to grab your ass?

13:50.945 --> 13:53.411
Is that a serious question
for your article?

13:53.413 --> 13:54.582
Nope.

14:21.643 --> 14:25.611
As the gloomy sky turns darker
above their heads,

14:25.613 --> 14:27.847
the paranormal crew steps
out of their vehicles

14:27.849 --> 14:29.948
and soaks in the lay
of the land.

14:29.950 --> 14:32.751
Will tonight's hunt
be to no avail?

14:32.753 --> 14:35.288
Or will it be the night
of their lives

14:35.290 --> 14:39.492
trapped in the asylum
with the souls of the damned?

14:39.494 --> 14:42.461
I swear to god, if he does
that all night, i'll kill him.

14:42.463 --> 14:43.762
No, you won't.

14:43.764 --> 14:47.366
Ah, hmm, ha ha ha,
laugh all you want.

14:47.368 --> 14:50.602
I am going to make you
look good in this piece.

14:50.604 --> 14:52.304
- Mr. Gunnin?
- That's me.

14:52.306 --> 14:54.439
- Richard. Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

14:54.441 --> 14:57.008
- I'm glad you and your team could make it.
- Yeah, no problem.

14:57.010 --> 14:59.444
What do you say
a couple of us go inside,

14:59.446 --> 15:02.484
- you can tell us a bit about the place.
- Sure. Follow me.

15:07.555 --> 15:10.488
Lights don't work in here.

15:10.490 --> 15:11.994
Don't know why.

15:13.661 --> 15:15.964
This is dr. Pender's office.

15:19.334 --> 15:23.968
I don't think anybody's been
in here since he flipped out

15:23.970 --> 15:27.540
and the state shut
the whole operation down.

15:27.542 --> 15:32.410
Even in the 90's when they tried to
turn it into a general state hospital,

15:32.412 --> 15:35.080
nobody stepped foot
in this room.

15:35.082 --> 15:38.617
What's with the dolls?

15:38.619 --> 15:40.886
They live here.

15:40.888 --> 15:45.056
I feel like these things
are, like, peering in my soul.

15:45.058 --> 15:49.694
Are those blood stains?

15:49.696 --> 15:53.531
This is a girl named mary's,
favorite doll.

15:53.533 --> 15:57.737
There was lots of kids
dumped at the asylum doors.

15:57.739 --> 16:01.873
Parents that didn't want
children around with problems.

16:01.875 --> 16:04.977
Mary's very active,
but from all my experiences,

16:04.979 --> 16:09.080
all she wants to do is play.

16:09.082 --> 16:11.883
Everything that's
happened here...

16:11.885 --> 16:14.822
why do you think nothing
has never happened to you?

16:16.758 --> 16:18.123
Can't say for sure.

16:18.125 --> 16:20.659
I know everything
that's happened here.

16:20.661 --> 16:24.630
When i bought the place i announced
that i was gonna support it,

16:24.632 --> 16:27.900
keep it going, and that's it.

16:27.902 --> 16:30.035
They have no
problem with me,

16:30.037 --> 16:32.838
i have no problem
with them.

16:32.840 --> 16:35.073
Are dr. Pender and mary
are the only spirits

16:35.075 --> 16:36.978
that make themselves known?

16:49.856 --> 16:54.160
This is ashley hemming.
She was a pediatric nurse

16:54.162 --> 16:56.929
in the children's ward.

16:56.931 --> 16:58.731
The kids loved her.

16:58.733 --> 17:01.000
Called her mom.

17:01.002 --> 17:05.037
She died trying
to protect them from pender,

17:05.039 --> 17:07.204
but he got them, too.

17:07.207 --> 17:09.174
It's terrible.

17:09.175 --> 17:11.976
If you have a friend that's
heard of the movie, "chucky,"

17:11.978 --> 17:14.713
i highly suggest you
bring him to this room.

17:14.714 --> 17:16.549
"Child's play".

17:16.550 --> 17:19.184
- What?
- The movie is called, "child's play,"

17:19.185 --> 17:20.786
not, "chucky."

17:20.788 --> 17:23.058
Chucky was the doll.

17:37.737 --> 17:40.940
You know what, i don't tell
you how to do your job, do i?

17:40.942 --> 17:42.808
You don't have to.

17:42.810 --> 17:45.144
Really? Because from the looks
of it this place is trashed.

17:45.146 --> 17:47.178
I mean there are blood
stains on the walls,

17:47.180 --> 17:48.681
creepy ass dolls
on the floor,

17:48.683 --> 17:50.715
and wheel chairs
in the way wherever we go.

17:50.717 --> 17:52.952
- Wheel chair.
- What?

17:52.954 --> 17:56.754
Wheel chair.
Singular. Not plural.

17:56.756 --> 17:59.758
There's only one wheel chair
on this floor.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.726
But we've tripped
on one almost every room.

18:01.728 --> 18:03.898
Yeah, i know.

18:08.969 --> 18:11.172
Richard, did you see that?

18:15.042 --> 18:17.646
I can't believe
you found this room.

18:21.215 --> 18:23.749
What happened in here?

18:23.751 --> 18:27.051
Everything.

18:27.053 --> 18:29.655
It does feel
very heavy in here.

18:29.657 --> 18:31.956
Something definitely
wants us outta here.

18:31.958 --> 18:33.826
Is that normal?

18:33.828 --> 18:37.930
The whole building
wants you out of here.

18:37.932 --> 18:39.264
Well, we'll see
if there's anything...

18:39.266 --> 18:41.133
- shit!
- What just happened?

18:41.135 --> 18:43.569
The audio just died.
It almost blew my ears out.

18:43.571 --> 18:46.771
Oh, guys!
Check this out. Come here.

18:46.773 --> 18:48.139
This thing's freaking out.

18:48.141 --> 18:50.876
- What is that?
- It's an emf meter.

18:50.878 --> 18:54.113
It measures the electrometric fields
that some people say ghosts give off.

18:54.115 --> 18:55.817
Let's make sure
yours isn't faulty.

18:57.284 --> 18:59.318
Do you still have video?
Can you film this?

18:59.320 --> 19:01.921
- Yeah, i'm getting it.
- Do you have a lot of electricity

19:01.923 --> 19:03.955
going through this room?
Wiring or anything

19:03.957 --> 19:06.692
that could give off a high
electromagnetic field?

19:06.694 --> 19:08.327
Just these little lights.

19:08.329 --> 19:10.930
That's not enough
to cause this.

19:10.932 --> 19:13.566
So what does
all this mean?

19:13.568 --> 19:16.135
Something took all
our equipment's energy,

19:16.137 --> 19:18.103
and it's standing
in this room with us.

19:18.105 --> 19:20.141
Oh, okay.

19:21.908 --> 19:24.876
Do you not like us
being in this room?

19:24.878 --> 19:26.611
Are you angry
we're in your space?

19:26.613 --> 19:30.014
If you want us to leave
just make a noise.

19:33.721 --> 19:36.355
- Did that just fall?
- No, that was ripped off the table.

19:36.357 --> 19:39.023
- Did you see that?
- Yes.

19:39.025 --> 19:40.195
Hold this.

19:56.910 --> 19:59.377
What's he doing?

19:59.379 --> 20:03.147
He's a sensitive. He's what
we like to call a sensitive.

20:03.149 --> 20:05.783
It means he more attuned
to the presence of spirits

20:05.785 --> 20:07.619
than most people.

20:07.621 --> 20:09.855
So, that's how
he found this room without

20:09.857 --> 20:12.057
- me telling him.
- Exactly.

20:12.059 --> 20:15.194
And sometimes if an object
is linked to a specific event

20:15.196 --> 20:17.996
it can contain
large amounts of energy,

20:17.998 --> 20:21.332
and we call those
trigger objects.

20:21.334 --> 20:24.869
If he picks one up,
he can see what happened

20:24.871 --> 20:27.806
fold out in front of him.

20:27.808 --> 20:30.876
It's something that he learned
when he was really young,

20:30.878 --> 20:34.115
but when his mother died
it got much stronger.

20:36.117 --> 20:38.751
Anything?

20:38.753 --> 20:40.187
No.

20:47.194 --> 20:49.360
All right,
this place is huge,

20:49.362 --> 20:53.232
so we're gonna have to split up into
two groups to cover more ground.

20:53.234 --> 20:56.068
Zak, when we're in the middle
in the investigation,

20:56.070 --> 20:59.137
stick to writing your notes. No
talking to your voice recorder.

20:59.139 --> 21:01.173
Yeah, because
splitting into groups

21:01.175 --> 21:03.744
always works great
in the movies.

21:05.446 --> 21:10.883
- What? It's true.
- All right, let's log this.

21:10.885 --> 21:14.185
We're standing here at the
walstrom psychiatric institute.

21:14.187 --> 21:15.887
We've heard some pretty
interesting stories

21:15.889 --> 21:18.223
about a violent doctor's spirit
roaming the building,

21:18.225 --> 21:20.925
who refuses to let anyone
step foot in here ever since

21:20.927 --> 21:22.226
his own mental breakdown.

21:22.228 --> 21:23.796
We're gonna break up
into two...

21:23.798 --> 21:26.464
did you hear that?

21:26.466 --> 21:29.867
Shh.

21:29.869 --> 21:32.838
Now i thought you said we were
the only ones in this building.

21:32.840 --> 21:37.145
- We are.
- Then who's walking around upstairs?

21:41.182 --> 21:42.950
Upstairs now!

21:47.021 --> 21:49.387
- Check if the
noise came from in here.

21:49.389 --> 21:52.257
This place is huge! How are
we supposed to find anything?

21:52.259 --> 21:55.327
Yeah, yeah, it definitely did.

21:55.329 --> 21:59.098
Look! This was upright
when we took our tour.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.965
This palate must have
gotten thrown over here.

22:02.770 --> 22:05.169
What do you see, man?
What do you see, rich?

22:05.171 --> 22:07.873
Shane?

22:07.875 --> 22:12.176
Okay, having you guys do this,
i know the audio and stuff

22:12.178 --> 22:14.946
earlier was probably staged,
but i saw all of us downstairs.

22:14.948 --> 22:16.415
Really?

22:16.417 --> 22:19.753
Now this is a way to start out
an investigation.

22:26.025 --> 22:28.961
Let's get the door.
Let's lift the door off.

22:28.963 --> 22:30.432
Give me a hand with this.

22:41.274 --> 22:44.943
Okay, let's all just take a
seat, see if anything happens.

22:44.945 --> 22:46.848
Get a feel
for the place at night.

22:55.388 --> 22:56.791
Thanks.

23:02.362 --> 23:06.330
Are we gonna listen
to music?

23:06.332 --> 23:08.469
Spirits can talk through
this little device.

23:24.484 --> 23:25.951
According to
the mother's statement,

23:25.953 --> 23:28.052
the kids were back
and forth all day

23:28.054 --> 23:32.223
playing a game outside
before they disappeared.

23:32.225 --> 23:36.161
Maybe they had some friends
that ran away.

23:36.163 --> 23:38.096
Maybe some friends
ran away in the past

23:38.098 --> 23:41.032
and told them
a good place to hide.

23:41.034 --> 23:43.601
They could tell us where they
might have gone, if you're right.

23:43.603 --> 23:45.937
- Yeah.
- Let's go back to the station,

23:45.939 --> 23:47.839
check out any other
runaway cases around here.

23:47.841 --> 23:49.441
You know what,
i'll call their mom,

23:49.443 --> 23:51.212
get a list
of their friends' names.

24:20.340 --> 24:24.111
All right!
All right.

24:25.512 --> 24:28.113
It's been half an hour,
nothing's happened.

24:28.115 --> 24:31.617
Let's split up.
Conner you come with me.

24:31.619 --> 24:34.118
Shane and nicky,
good luck.

24:34.120 --> 24:36.187
Zak, who do you
want to go with?

24:36.189 --> 24:37.889
Ah, where's
everyone heading?

24:37.891 --> 24:40.192
I was thinking
the surgery room.

24:40.194 --> 24:41.425
Play with
the trigger object.

24:41.427 --> 24:42.961
Probably just wander
in the halls,

24:42.963 --> 24:44.996
need to get a better feel
of the place.

24:44.998 --> 24:46.365
I'll probably
just head with nicky,

24:46.367 --> 24:49.334
i mean, trigger objects
are totally cool.

24:49.336 --> 24:53.474
It would make the story
that much, you know, creepier.

25:03.183 --> 25:04.385
Beep.

25:09.490 --> 25:12.357
- Peter.
- What?

25:12.359 --> 25:14.626
What the hell could be
taking so long?

25:14.628 --> 25:16.494
I thought you were just
checking to see

25:16.496 --> 25:20.197
if these kids had any friends
that had ever run away.

25:20.199 --> 25:22.300
I was.

25:22.302 --> 25:24.001
What the hell
are you doing now?

25:24.003 --> 25:26.137
Doesn't look like anyone
they know has run away,

25:26.139 --> 25:28.205
but there have been
a lot of missing kids

25:28.207 --> 25:30.242
over the last 15
years or so.

25:30.244 --> 25:34.346
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:34.348 --> 25:37.214
They've been spread out enough
that no one has noticed.

25:37.216 --> 25:40.117
But a kid had gone missing
every couple of years

25:40.119 --> 25:42.453
within a 10 mile radius.

25:42.455 --> 25:46.524
So what? Kids go missing.
Kids run away.

25:46.526 --> 25:48.059
Great attitude.

25:48.061 --> 25:50.162
Hey, i'm not saying
i'm happy about it.

25:50.164 --> 25:52.630
I'm just saying, it's something
that happens everywhere.

25:52.632 --> 25:55.533
Doesn't mean they're
always connected.

25:55.535 --> 25:58.736
Maybe you're right.

25:58.738 --> 26:03.075
- But you don't care, do you?
- Nope.

26:03.077 --> 26:05.179
Ooh, wonderful.

26:22.161 --> 26:23.261
Where are we?

26:23.263 --> 26:26.301
I have absolutely no idea.

26:35.341 --> 26:37.675
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

26:37.677 --> 26:40.712
Wind or something?

26:40.714 --> 26:42.748
We're been in here
for almost four hours,

26:42.750 --> 26:44.619
and i have yet
to feel a draft.

26:50.323 --> 26:53.625
What's the matter?
You don't find this thrilling?

26:53.627 --> 26:58.032
Are you kidding me? This is totally
how i want to spend my friday night.

27:08.242 --> 27:10.274
Well, you can't deny
that you heard that.

27:10.276 --> 27:13.444
That was loud. I bet we got
that in the recorder for sure.

27:13.446 --> 27:15.614
Who yelled that?

27:15.616 --> 27:17.515
Use your brain,
journalist.

27:17.517 --> 27:19.784
Let's say you were being
shot by a crazy doctor,

27:19.786 --> 27:21.453
what's the one thing
you'd be yelling

27:21.455 --> 27:25.057
- before you bled out?
- Ouch? Shit?

27:27.593 --> 27:29.126
Dr. Pender's office.

27:29.128 --> 27:30.796
The yell, it came from
the room in there?

27:30.798 --> 27:32.664
It sounded like it.

27:32.666 --> 27:34.569
No one's in here.

27:49.616 --> 27:54.586
Is the room starting to feel
a bit heavy to you?

27:54.588 --> 27:56.391
Yeah, a little.

28:57.283 --> 28:59.151
What's he doing over there?

28:59.153 --> 29:00.784
He's unscrewing
his flashlight

29:00.786 --> 29:03.454
to the point where the slightest
touch will make it turn on.

29:03.456 --> 29:06.860
It's just another way we can try
and communicate with any spirit.

29:15.468 --> 29:17.205
Okay.

29:18.871 --> 29:21.940
All right, this
is an emf detector.

29:21.942 --> 29:23.742
- Emf detector.
- Okay?

29:23.744 --> 29:27.945
This detects electromagnetic
fields in slight variation.

29:27.947 --> 29:30.781
Okay? So, very sensitive.

29:30.783 --> 29:32.751
Just... you can hold onto it.

29:32.753 --> 29:35.654
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

29:35.656 --> 29:36.855
- Got that?
- Yep.

29:36.857 --> 29:38.623
Me not moving.
Right here.

29:38.625 --> 29:41.425
- Just still.
- Still.

29:41.427 --> 29:43.360
Okay.

29:43.362 --> 29:44.498
Ready?

29:49.969 --> 29:53.972
This is evp session
in dr. Pender's office.

29:53.974 --> 29:55.906
Oh, my god.

29:55.908 --> 29:57.876
It's... it's an electronic
voice phenomenon.

29:57.878 --> 30:00.511
We're just trying to catch their
voices within the white noise.

30:00.513 --> 30:01.613
White noise?

30:01.615 --> 30:04.249
Mmm.

30:04.251 --> 30:07.519
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna
figure it out later for you.

30:07.521 --> 30:09.421
Just for you.

30:09.423 --> 30:11.192
Thank you.

30:13.359 --> 30:14.826
If there's anyone
in here with us

30:14.828 --> 30:17.861
that little red dot
on the desk means

30:17.863 --> 30:19.799
that we can hear you.

30:21.635 --> 30:24.739
Can you make yourself
known by making a noise?

30:31.311 --> 30:35.515
Uh, how about moving one
of the books on the bookshelf?

30:37.783 --> 30:39.517
Hello.

30:39.519 --> 30:41.353
- Okay, okay.
- Take it. Take it.

30:41.355 --> 30:43.588
Got it. Got it. Got it. Okay.
Yeah, that's a strong one.

30:43.590 --> 30:47.259
- Check that out. Got it?
- I got it.

30:47.261 --> 30:48.628
Okay.

30:59.339 --> 31:01.576
Is there someone
in the room with us?

31:17.657 --> 31:20.227
- What?
- I thought i saw something.

31:28.801 --> 31:31.703
Oh, shit!
Come on!

31:31.705 --> 31:32.904
Come on, let's go!

31:32.906 --> 31:35.540
Conner, wait!

31:35.542 --> 31:37.809
If you're willing to talk,

31:37.811 --> 31:42.582
turn the flashlight on for
yes and keep it off for no.

31:43.817 --> 31:45.486
Do you understand?

31:53.627 --> 31:55.963
Are you dr. Pender?

32:01.100 --> 32:02.969
Are you nurse hemming?

32:07.707 --> 32:09.374
It's getting kind
of cold in here.

32:09.376 --> 32:10.945
Okay.

32:13.746 --> 32:16.449
How do we even
know it went this way.

32:47.113 --> 32:51.619
Do the spirits like people
inside this hospital?

32:58.125 --> 33:01.626
Is there some kind of evil
presence in this building?

33:01.628 --> 33:04.064
Something that wants
to do us harm?

33:09.770 --> 33:11.603
Do they want us to leave?

33:42.569 --> 33:45.039
Okay, something really bad must
have happened here.

34:13.667 --> 34:15.902
Where's nurse hemming?

34:18.904 --> 34:21.639
Then get back to work.

34:21.641 --> 34:23.474
Doctor, why are you
covered in blood?

34:30.116 --> 34:31.882
What are you doing?

35:39.018 --> 35:40.951
Rich, dude check this out.

35:40.953 --> 35:43.957
It's like zzzz.

35:46.159 --> 35:48.992
What's up?

35:48.994 --> 35:51.762
If only i could have gotten
it on film, can you imagine?

35:51.764 --> 35:54.732
Thank god we found you guys. You'll
never believe what happened to us.

35:54.734 --> 35:58.101
Rich just saw dr. Pender
electrocute a victim.

35:58.103 --> 35:59.637
Why? What happened
with you guys?

35:59.639 --> 36:01.242
Come on!

36:02.241 --> 36:04.244
Did you hear what i said?

36:16.690 --> 36:20.761
Well, she obviously left when we
went to go find you guys, so...

36:24.230 --> 36:26.663
we've already spent
quite a bit of time here,

36:26.665 --> 36:29.032
maybe we should
try other places.

36:29.034 --> 36:32.737
If you were getting a lot of activity in
these areas, there's no point in leaving.

36:32.739 --> 36:34.137
But the room feels
different though.

36:34.139 --> 36:35.942
The energy's gone.

36:37.978 --> 36:41.212
Let me try one last thing
before we leave.

36:41.214 --> 36:43.317
I have a hunch.

36:53.793 --> 36:56.360
I was so close,

36:56.362 --> 36:59.096
but you had
to ruin everything,

36:59.098 --> 37:02.733
you stupid bitch.

37:02.735 --> 37:05.902
All this work.
Years of research...

37:05.904 --> 37:09.873
gone! Because you couldn't
shut your god damn mouth!

37:09.875 --> 37:14.411
If anyone belongs in this
institution, it's you.

37:14.413 --> 37:18.315
You're insane. You'll burn
in hell for what you did.

37:18.317 --> 37:22.987
If i'm burning in hell,
i'm taking you with me!

37:24.056 --> 37:25.192
No!

37:26.259 --> 37:29.159
Okay.
Okay, okay.

37:34.900 --> 37:36.971
This... this is
my life's work.

37:39.806 --> 37:42.407
No one can have
my life's work.

37:46.378 --> 37:48.047
You're all dead!

38:20.279 --> 38:25.282
It's kicking in stronger and more
frequently than ever before.

38:26.853 --> 38:28.920
This is unreal.

38:28.922 --> 38:32.023
He killed two security guards
when he snapped.

38:32.025 --> 38:35.863
One over there,
and one back there.

38:37.931 --> 38:39.867
Well, what's that?

38:47.440 --> 38:49.810
Some dog tags.

38:54.447 --> 38:56.850
So, what now?

39:01.420 --> 39:04.755
I think we got ourselves too wrapped
up in the current situation,

39:04.757 --> 39:07.958
and forgot there's plenty
more hospital to search.

39:07.960 --> 39:11.094
Everyone knows dr. Pender was
the one who snapped.

39:11.096 --> 39:14.098
We weren't hired
to figure out how.

39:14.100 --> 39:17.367
We were hired to collect
evidence of paranormal activity.

39:17.369 --> 39:19.036
Let's get back to that.

39:19.038 --> 39:21.105
Swap out cards
and batteries real quick.

39:21.107 --> 39:22.139
We'll split up again.

39:22.141 --> 39:24.177
New groups though.

39:30.116 --> 39:31.782
- New groups?
- Yeah.

39:31.784 --> 39:33.451
Oh, don't worry.
If i hear you scream,

39:33.453 --> 39:36.020
i'll be there in,
like, a second.

39:36.022 --> 39:38.121
And nicky and conner,

39:38.123 --> 39:40.858
you guys can go
explore a new wing.

39:40.860 --> 39:43.831
Shane and zak,
one of the halls.

39:46.866 --> 39:50.000
So, are you still
a non-believer?

39:50.002 --> 39:52.837
I mean, everything i witnessed
tonight is totally doable

39:52.839 --> 39:54.371
by a fishing line.

39:54.373 --> 39:55.806
And the noises?

39:55.808 --> 39:58.275
Clearly you came in
months ago

39:58.277 --> 40:00.480
and placed speakers
all over the place.

40:04.449 --> 40:06.119
See you later.

40:16.462 --> 40:20.331
This place is far too big.
Where the hell are we?

40:20.333 --> 40:22.136
Jackpot.

40:34.047 --> 40:36.880
- Did you...
- yeah.

40:36.882 --> 40:39.349
Mary?

40:41.487 --> 40:43.523
Did you lead us in here?

40:46.458 --> 40:49.061
Is there something
you wanted us to see?

40:52.297 --> 40:54.567
Oh, my god!
Tell me what you hear.

41:00.038 --> 41:02.441
- Mom.
- Keep doing that.

41:03.509 --> 41:07.445
Is there anyone
in here with us?

41:07.447 --> 41:10.083
We're not here to hurt
anybody, we just want to talk.

41:11.918 --> 41:13.583
Can you tell me your name?

41:13.585 --> 41:14.985
Jesus crist!

41:14.987 --> 41:17.654
Oh! What happened?

41:17.656 --> 41:19.590
The... the... the...
there was a man

41:19.592 --> 41:22.025
sitting right there.
He was burned to a crisp.

41:22.027 --> 41:26.429
There's no one there. I saw him as...
as clear as i see you right now.

41:26.431 --> 41:28.465
Hold on.
I got it on camera.

41:33.406 --> 41:35.239
I know i...

41:35.241 --> 41:39.110
it... it froze the exact
moment i saw him.

41:39.112 --> 41:41.645
- It can't be a coincidence.
- You said he was burnt?

41:41.647 --> 41:44.483
Scorched, scalded.
Charred, whatever.

42:00.366 --> 42:01.501
What's wrong?

42:03.435 --> 42:08.239
- What's wrong?
- I don't feel so good.

42:08.241 --> 42:10.944
Oh, oh, boy, let's go.

42:12.078 --> 42:13.444
I can't... i can't move.

42:13.446 --> 42:14.882
You have to!

42:20.453 --> 42:22.255
Richard, shane,
i need your help!

42:28.261 --> 42:31.628
All right, come on,
come on. Conner.

42:31.630 --> 42:33.496
Conner!

44:05.257 --> 44:08.092
Please, no!

44:08.094 --> 44:13.463
Did you really think turning me in
wouldn't have its consequences?

44:13.465 --> 44:16.666
I could have changed
the course of humanity.

44:16.668 --> 44:19.536
A future with limitless
brain capacity.

44:19.538 --> 44:21.172
And you ruined it!

44:21.174 --> 44:25.809
Please doctor, do anything
you want with me,

44:25.811 --> 44:28.579
but leave the children alone.

44:34.119 --> 44:35.719
Please.

44:51.603 --> 44:54.804
You took everything
from my life!

44:54.806 --> 44:57.343
Now i'm gonna take
everything from yours!

45:00.712 --> 45:04.815
And you can watch me start
with dear little david.

45:04.817 --> 45:08.652
Oh, dear.

45:39.618 --> 45:42.822
I... i don't want
to investigate this area.

45:48.261 --> 45:50.661
Can we leave?

45:50.663 --> 45:53.163
Yeah, of course.

46:13.953 --> 46:19.125
You two go off
and investigate whatever.

46:20.893 --> 46:23.630
I need to be alone
for a bit.

46:43.549 --> 46:45.886
Son of a bitch.

46:57.529 --> 46:59.362
Hey!

46:59.364 --> 47:01.632
Hey, guys!

47:01.634 --> 47:03.567
Guys! Guys, let me out!

47:03.569 --> 47:04.771
Guys!

47:09.909 --> 47:13.309
Oh, fuck!
Guys! Let me out!

47:14.413 --> 47:16.416
Please, no!

47:19.485 --> 47:20.750
Richard, what are you doing?

47:20.752 --> 47:22.786
- Thinking.
- Rich, conner passed out,

47:22.788 --> 47:25.021
and there's some really creepy
shit happening in the morgue.

47:25.023 --> 47:28.358
- The morgue?
- I tried to walkie you, but you forgot to pass them out,

47:28.360 --> 47:31.897
- i can't move him on my own,
i just need to see if he's okay. - Let's go! Let's go!

47:38.270 --> 47:43.407
Wow.

47:43.409 --> 47:46.277
Okay!

47:46.279 --> 47:48.512
Let's see if we can
taunt this doctor

47:48.514 --> 47:49.716
into giving us a visit.

47:51.317 --> 47:52.983
What? You think he's
just chilling in here,

47:52.985 --> 47:55.355
taking a nice little
ghost shower, huh?

47:58.590 --> 48:00.757
See, this is why
i don't like you.

48:00.759 --> 48:02.992
I knew from the minute
i saw you that you

48:02.994 --> 48:04.527
were gonna come
into this investigation

48:04.529 --> 48:06.529
with us just thinking
this was a joke.

48:06.531 --> 48:09.500
Thinking that we probably should be
locked up in a hospital like this,

48:09.502 --> 48:12.469
for something that we
believe to be true.

48:12.471 --> 48:14.938
God, tonight alone
i have seen more evidence

48:14.940 --> 48:16.974
than we would normally
capture in a year,

48:16.976 --> 48:18.574
and you witnessed it all.

48:18.576 --> 48:20.376
But you...

48:20.378 --> 48:21.712
you're just gonna
write this story

48:21.714 --> 48:23.480
making us out to be clowns,

48:23.482 --> 48:25.349
only because you
are too in denial

48:25.351 --> 48:29.320
to believe what is
happening to us is real.

48:29.322 --> 48:31.755
So, you know what?

48:31.757 --> 48:35.458
You can just fuck off

48:35.460 --> 48:39.598
because i don't give
a shit anymore.

48:41.400 --> 48:43.634
Write that in your article.

48:49.708 --> 48:53.576
Look, the things
you've shown me tonight

48:53.578 --> 48:55.045
have completely changed
my perspective.

48:55.047 --> 48:56.746
Okay? I'm not gonna
lie to you.

48:56.748 --> 48:59.516
I came in here
thinking exactly that.

48:59.518 --> 49:01.751
But all this other stuff
that i've been saying

49:01.753 --> 49:03.587
is just to make
myself feel better,

49:03.589 --> 49:05.054
because to be
honest with you,

49:05.056 --> 49:08.025
i am on the verge
of shitting my pants.

49:08.027 --> 49:12.462
I don't know how you guys stand
to do this over and over again,

49:12.464 --> 49:15.532
because i can honestly say after
tonight i'm fucking retiring.

49:15.534 --> 49:19.536
- Okay? Make you happy?
- Okay.

49:19.538 --> 49:23.072
So let's continue this investigation
and let's spy on some naked ghosts.

49:23.074 --> 49:28.911
It's the female locker room,
right?

49:28.913 --> 49:30.681
I hope so.

49:30.683 --> 49:32.983
All right.

49:41.493 --> 49:45.128
Shh.
Shh.

49:45.130 --> 49:47.801
Do not show fear.

49:49.768 --> 49:52.503
It will be drawn to you.

49:52.505 --> 49:55.938
There's something dark here.

49:55.940 --> 49:57.674
Whatever is here
feeds off that.

49:57.676 --> 50:01.744
It wants you to be scared.

50:01.746 --> 50:06.083
You have to keep your cool.
Your life depends on it.

50:06.085 --> 50:11.087
Now as calmly as possible,

50:11.089 --> 50:13.092
tell me what happened here.

50:24.170 --> 50:26.936
We heard noises,
so we came in here,

50:26.938 --> 50:29.840
and conner said
he saw a burnt man,

50:29.842 --> 50:32.442
and so we checked
that compartment

50:32.444 --> 50:35.545
and we found
the burnt clothes,

50:35.547 --> 50:38.118
and that's when he said he
felt sick and he passed out.

51:20.860 --> 51:24.761
- Nicky?
- Yeah, what?

51:24.763 --> 51:29.565
We need to find
shane and zak,

51:29.567 --> 51:31.201
and get out of here.

51:31.203 --> 51:34.871
- But, conner.
- No, no, no, no, no. Shh.

51:34.873 --> 51:38.074
Oh.

51:38.076 --> 51:40.844
I don't know
what else to do.

51:40.846 --> 51:45.248
- You know i love conner too, but right now we're...
- what?

51:45.250 --> 51:50.087
Right now,
we're all in danger.

51:50.089 --> 51:52.154
If conner were here,

51:52.156 --> 51:56.826
he'd want us to be safe before
we worry about him, wouldn't he?

51:56.828 --> 51:58.094
Wouldn't he?

51:58.096 --> 52:00.931
- Yes.
- Okay.

52:00.933 --> 52:04.268
- Okay.
- Okay.

52:04.270 --> 52:08.641
- Let's go.
- Okay.

52:19.217 --> 52:23.887
The great doctor pender.

52:23.889 --> 52:26.290
Why don't you come
in here with us, huh?

52:26.292 --> 52:28.724
I hear all these stories
about how terrifying you are,

52:28.726 --> 52:30.594
but you haven't
proven it to me yet.

52:30.596 --> 52:32.061
Why do you guys
yell at them?

52:32.063 --> 52:33.563
Not them, just pender.

52:33.565 --> 52:35.098
You can't show fear
with bullies.

52:35.100 --> 52:36.800
I learned that
from rich years ago.

52:36.802 --> 52:39.969
Whatever you say.

52:39.971 --> 52:43.306
Hit plenty of
other people in here, huh?

52:43.308 --> 52:46.143
Well, let's see how strong
you really are.

52:46.145 --> 52:49.282
Hit me right here
in the face.

52:50.848 --> 52:53.118
It's not like i've never
been in a fight before.

52:55.119 --> 52:56.719
- What the fuck?
- What happened?

52:56.721 --> 52:59.088
I swear to god something
just touched my neck.

52:59.090 --> 53:02.092
- Oh, jesus christ,
you scared the shit out of me.

53:02.094 --> 53:03.960
We're getting outta here.
This investigation is over.

53:03.962 --> 53:05.295
What do you mean?

53:05.297 --> 53:07.630
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait,
why are you crying?

53:07.632 --> 53:12.869
Hey, what's going on?

53:12.871 --> 53:16.005
Conner's dead.

53:16.007 --> 53:18.308
What?

53:18.310 --> 53:21.110
It's not funny, man. I thought
we were being professional.

53:21.112 --> 53:23.346
I'm not being funny.
We found him in the morgue.

53:23.348 --> 53:24.650
We're leaving.

53:27.987 --> 53:31.188
I'm not kidding, man,
this is amateur humor.

53:31.190 --> 53:34.190
Conner, don't even
bother jumping out.

53:34.192 --> 53:38.862
Conner's dead!

53:41.065 --> 53:44.571
Conner is dead.

53:51.009 --> 53:53.809
Something killed him.

53:53.811 --> 53:58.715
It tried to attack
nicky in the morgue.

53:58.717 --> 54:02.251
We're getting out
of this place now.

54:02.253 --> 54:04.123
Zak, call the police.

54:31.116 --> 54:37.020
How did he...

54:37.022 --> 54:41.224
he was electrocuted alive.

54:41.226 --> 54:43.326
He was electrocuted.

54:43.328 --> 54:46.096
Like a patient
i saw in my vision.

54:46.098 --> 54:50.036
My phone, it's dead.

54:56.208 --> 54:58.275
The video camera says
the battery died here, too.

55:01.846 --> 55:04.715
Did you hear that?

55:06.719 --> 55:07.750
What'd it say?

55:07.752 --> 55:11.020
Trapped.

55:11.022 --> 55:12.190
Let's go!

55:23.134 --> 55:25.871
Can't help.

55:27.873 --> 55:30.005
- Who needs help?
- What's your name?

55:30.007 --> 55:31.007
Do you need help?

55:32.043 --> 55:34.811
Nurse hemming.

55:34.813 --> 55:39.116
I saw what happened to you
and the kids in the basement.

55:39.118 --> 55:41.250
You saved one boy though.

55:41.252 --> 55:43.018
David.

55:43.020 --> 55:44.887
I recognized him in
the newspaper article.

55:44.889 --> 55:46.523
Your sacrifice
wasn't in vain.

55:46.525 --> 55:48.791
Hide.

55:48.793 --> 55:49.793
Hide?

55:49.795 --> 55:53.096
We need to go.

55:54.933 --> 55:57.867
Is that normal?

55:57.869 --> 56:00.469
No.

56:09.380 --> 56:11.447
She's trying
to lead us somewhere.

56:11.449 --> 56:15.117
Something tried to lead conner and me
to the morgue and look what happened.

56:15.119 --> 56:16.485
- Sorry.
- Rich, what are you doing?

56:16.487 --> 56:18.822
We need to get help,
you said it yourself.

56:18.824 --> 56:22.159
Do you realize how much energy it took
for her to show herself like that?

56:22.161 --> 56:24.561
She took all of our cell phones'
and our cameras' energy.

56:24.563 --> 56:28.165
She said truth. There is
something she wants us to see!

56:28.167 --> 56:31.134
She also said the word trapped,
and that dr. Pender is coming.

56:31.136 --> 56:35.204
Conner is dead. Your friend is dead.
We need to go get help.

56:35.206 --> 56:38.007
I just... i can't explain it,
but i need to follow her.

56:38.009 --> 56:39.509
No, rich, just please
don't go, okay?

56:39.511 --> 56:41.378
Just come with us.
Just let it go.

56:41.380 --> 56:43.445
No, no, no,
i will not!

56:43.447 --> 56:45.315
No!

56:45.317 --> 56:50.353
I'm fucking tired
of being told to move on!

56:50.355 --> 56:52.889
My entire life
i've been able to see things

56:52.891 --> 56:54.291
that other people couldn't.

56:54.293 --> 56:58.829
I've been given a gift
that no one understood.

56:58.831 --> 57:02.833
Then my mom,
the one person

57:02.835 --> 57:04.936
who may have had
some answers for me died.

57:10.174 --> 57:14.043
I don't care what my dad says,
i don't care what you say,

57:14.045 --> 57:17.313
i don't care
what anyone says,

57:17.315 --> 57:20.217
i have this gift, and i'm
not letting it go to waste,

57:20.219 --> 57:23.186
so i'm gonna do everything i can
to help, because something in here

57:23.188 --> 57:26.155
wants my help.

57:28.025 --> 57:31.293
Look, i know this
means a lot to you,

57:31.295 --> 57:34.630
really, i do,

57:34.632 --> 57:38.300
but there's some things
that are just bigger than us.

57:38.302 --> 57:40.971
Just think about conner.

57:40.973 --> 57:44.340
Let's get out of here, and take
care of that first.

57:44.342 --> 57:48.411
Okay?

57:48.413 --> 57:51.016
Not everyone needs
to talk to the police.

57:55.453 --> 57:58.654
Leave me behind.

57:58.656 --> 58:01.523
I just have too strong
a feeling about this.

58:01.525 --> 58:04.226
Damn it.

58:04.228 --> 58:05.895
- Fuck!
- No one is going with him?

58:05.897 --> 58:09.099
Look, we have to go
get help, okay? Okay?

58:09.101 --> 58:11.233
Oh, fuck.
God damn it.

58:11.235 --> 58:13.402
No, zak, stop!

58:13.404 --> 58:16.172
What happened to don't
try to impress her?

58:16.174 --> 58:19.308
At this point do you really think
i'm still trying to impress you?

58:19.310 --> 58:21.511
Before i was, i was trying
to impress you,

58:21.513 --> 58:23.579
but this shit
is real to me now, okay?

58:23.581 --> 58:25.648
So go get help

58:25.650 --> 58:30.320
and we'll talk
about this over dinner.

58:30.322 --> 58:32.221
Ahh!

58:32.223 --> 58:33.657
Stop! Everything is locked.

58:33.659 --> 58:35.692
Yeah, cause we told nathan
to lock us inside.

58:35.694 --> 58:38.695
- Well, we are never going out of there.
- No shit.

58:38.697 --> 58:40.596
The place is built
to keep people inside.

58:40.598 --> 58:42.532
God damn it!

58:44.469 --> 58:46.001
If they had actually
run away,

58:46.003 --> 58:47.503
they would have been
home by now.

58:47.505 --> 58:51.074
Most runaways don't actually
stay gone this long.

58:51.076 --> 58:52.574
Especially at that age.

58:52.576 --> 58:57.179
I don't know what
to tell you, man.

58:57.181 --> 58:58.681
We're in the town
of walstrom,

58:58.683 --> 59:01.050
- aren't we?
- Yeah, why?

59:01.052 --> 59:04.353
Call the mom. There's one
thing i want to ask her.

59:04.355 --> 59:05.558
Okay.

59:09.994 --> 59:11.293
Hello, yes,
this is officer masich.

59:11.295 --> 59:13.163
My partner wants
to ask you a question

59:13.165 --> 59:14.530
about your missing children.

59:14.532 --> 59:16.266
Hello, ma'am, sorry,
again about the time.

59:16.268 --> 59:18.567
There's just one thing.
Your statement said,

59:18.569 --> 59:21.204
the boys were playing a game
before and after dinner.

59:21.206 --> 59:23.105
On the night of
the disappearance, right?

59:23.107 --> 59:25.944
What exactly
were they playing?

59:28.612 --> 59:30.246
Thank you, very much.

59:34.353 --> 59:36.386
What the hell, man?

59:36.388 --> 59:39.491
They ran away. I have an idea
about where they might have gone.

59:43.027 --> 59:46.628
Shane! Shane!
There's nothing over here.

59:46.630 --> 59:48.098
Shane.

59:59.578 --> 01:00:02.645
Doc! Doc! I don't want to
take these pills anymore!

01:00:02.647 --> 01:00:05.447
Doc! I don't want to take
these pills no more, doc.

01:00:05.449 --> 01:00:07.483
I don't want to take these
pills.

01:00:07.485 --> 01:00:09.288
Come on, doc.

01:00:27.038 --> 01:00:28.337
You can't escape!

01:00:28.339 --> 01:00:31.543
You can't escape,
they're spying on you.

01:00:36.547 --> 01:00:39.215
Oh, no. He's coming.

01:00:39.217 --> 01:00:41.186
He's coming.

01:00:45.389 --> 01:00:48.491
You can't escape,
you're mine now.

01:00:48.493 --> 01:00:51.161
We can't escape this body now.

01:00:52.831 --> 01:00:56.299
He's coming.
He's coming.

01:00:56.301 --> 01:00:58.237
He's coming.

01:01:42.279 --> 01:01:45.681
Nothing bad was ever
supposed to happen here.

01:01:45.683 --> 01:01:50.152
We only wanted to help
our patients.

01:01:50.154 --> 01:01:51.523
Uh.

01:01:56.527 --> 01:01:58.828
Richard.

01:01:58.830 --> 01:02:02.232
Oh, shit. Oh.

01:02:02.234 --> 01:02:03.601
Oh.

01:02:13.277 --> 01:02:16.411
A lot happened
in these rooms...

01:02:16.413 --> 01:02:20.282
but this is not the worst
area of the hospital.

01:02:20.284 --> 01:02:24.320
Oh, no way.

01:02:25.757 --> 01:02:29.458
Nurse hemming?

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:33.262
Let me show you.

01:02:33.264 --> 01:02:35.433
The kids need help.

01:02:42.806 --> 01:02:45.474
I don't know what you went
through, but rich told me

01:02:45.476 --> 01:02:47.612
you tried helping
the kids.

01:02:50.882 --> 01:02:53.752
Rich! Rich!

01:03:00.592 --> 01:03:04.761
Oh, come on!

01:03:04.763 --> 01:03:07.797
Okay, think, think, think.
Would i...

01:03:16.942 --> 01:03:19.608
dr. Pender?

01:03:19.610 --> 01:03:22.744
Is that you?

01:03:22.746 --> 01:03:27.282
You're gonna have to do a lot
more than that to scare me away.

01:03:31.489 --> 01:03:34.260
Flickering lights!

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:37.659
Really?

01:03:37.661 --> 01:03:39.628
Why don't you treat me
like a man,

01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:41.766
and hit me!

01:03:47.706 --> 01:03:49.542
Hello?

01:03:50.574 --> 01:03:53.942
Okay, um, oh, god.

01:03:53.944 --> 01:03:55.811
How did they do this?

01:03:55.813 --> 01:04:00.849
Are... oh... if there's someone
in the room with me,

01:04:00.851 --> 01:04:02.585
can you please
make a noise?

01:04:02.587 --> 01:04:03.987
Fuck.

01:04:03.989 --> 01:04:06.021
I ...?

01:04:06.023 --> 01:04:08.858
If you're the nurse,
or one of the patients,

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:11.893
can you please
make another noise?

01:04:11.895 --> 01:04:16.632
Are you one
of the little kids?

01:04:19.503 --> 01:04:23.273
Can't show fear.

01:04:23.275 --> 01:04:25.608
If you're the psychotic
asshole murderer,

01:04:25.610 --> 01:04:27.944
dr. Pender,
make yourself known.

01:04:27.946 --> 01:04:29.811
You fuck!

01:04:29.813 --> 01:04:31.648
The fuck
did you do that?

01:04:34.853 --> 01:04:37.719
Oh, fuck.

01:04:37.721 --> 01:04:39.054
Ah!

01:04:44.362 --> 01:04:46.395
Somebody fucking help me!

01:04:47.732 --> 01:04:49.998
Oh, fuck.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.534
Fucking help me.

01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.409
What the hell.

01:06:07.978 --> 01:06:09.945
He's coming.

01:06:09.947 --> 01:06:11.614
He's coming.

01:06:11.616 --> 01:06:16.886
Don't let him get you.

01:06:16.888 --> 01:06:18.556
He's coming.

01:06:39.411 --> 01:06:41.380
Run.

01:07:30.962 --> 01:07:35.567
Dr. Pender...
dr. Pender?

01:07:39.471 --> 01:07:41.804
Oh, yeah.

01:07:41.806 --> 01:07:43.105
That's it.

01:07:43.107 --> 01:07:46.241
That's it. Oh!
We are close, david.

01:07:46.243 --> 01:07:47.742
Very close.

01:07:47.744 --> 01:07:50.645
You're going to help me
change the world.

01:07:50.647 --> 01:07:55.985
There. Now, once i can see
the left frontal lobe...

01:07:57.489 --> 01:07:59.221
oh, miss hemming.
You're about to witness

01:07:59.223 --> 01:08:01.891
the trial run that will
change the world of medicine.

01:08:01.893 --> 01:08:03.992
Have you lost your mind?

01:08:03.994 --> 01:08:05.494
I beg your pardon?

01:08:05.496 --> 01:08:08.864
Oh, my god.
Have you been performing

01:08:08.866 --> 01:08:11.266
these experiments on all
of our patients?

01:08:11.268 --> 01:08:13.636
Is that where the scars
are coming from?

01:08:16.107 --> 01:08:17.773
Who are they?

01:08:17.774 --> 01:08:19.908
Lab rats.
Test subjects.

01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:21.777
I'm trying to find
a way to increase...

01:08:21.779 --> 01:08:24.279
i don't care what
you're trying to do.

01:08:24.281 --> 01:08:25.779
You let him go.

01:08:25.782 --> 01:08:27.716
I will not.

01:08:27.718 --> 01:08:29.118
Not when i am
this close.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.051
Oh, my god.

01:08:34.057 --> 01:08:36.725
She just doesn't understand
my brilliance, david.

01:08:36.727 --> 01:08:39.127
She can't see the light at
the end of the tunnel.

01:08:39.129 --> 01:08:41.662
What i can do for the world.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.867
- Stop!
- What?

01:08:44.868 --> 01:08:48.738
Let the boy go.

01:09:18.002 --> 01:09:20.068
- Jesus.
- Please don't hurt us.

01:09:20.069 --> 01:09:21.604
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:09:21.606 --> 01:09:23.203
I'm here to help you.

01:09:24.975 --> 01:09:27.274
Don't worry, you guys.
How long have you been here?

01:09:27.277 --> 01:09:29.578
I don't know. We were
playing this ghost game,

01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:31.912
and this guy,
he kept us here.

01:09:31.915 --> 01:09:33.314
Okay, come on. I'm not gonna
hurt you.

01:09:33.317 --> 01:09:35.751
Come on.

01:09:35.752 --> 01:09:39.287
Okay, all right.

01:09:39.288 --> 01:09:42.256
I have friends in here
trying to get out, as well.

01:09:42.259 --> 01:09:45.027
Now i want you both to run
as fast as you can

01:09:45.029 --> 01:09:46.962
and find the front door.

01:09:46.964 --> 01:09:49.229
If it's not already open,
find a good hiding spot,

01:09:49.232 --> 01:09:50.866
and wait.

01:09:50.868 --> 01:09:53.903
A man is gonna be here soon
and he'll open it.

01:09:53.904 --> 01:09:56.939
Then i want you to run out
as fast as you can,

01:09:56.941 --> 01:09:59.175
and get help.

01:09:59.177 --> 01:10:00.876
Okay?

01:10:00.878 --> 01:10:01.914
Go!

01:10:26.704 --> 01:10:30.006
Earlier in the night,

01:10:30.008 --> 01:10:34.310
our friend conner
was found dead.

01:10:34.312 --> 01:10:38.314
I've also found two boys
locked up in a hidden room

01:10:38.316 --> 01:10:42.350
inside dr. Pender's office.

01:10:42.352 --> 01:10:46.154
I had the night
completely wrong.

01:10:46.156 --> 01:10:50.426
The spirits were not
trying to hurt us.

01:10:50.428 --> 01:10:53.229
They were trying
to help us find the boys,

01:10:53.231 --> 01:10:57.033
and get them and us
out alive.

01:10:58.736 --> 01:11:01.436
It wasn't an angry spirit.

01:11:01.438 --> 01:11:03.104
It was...

01:11:03.106 --> 01:11:05.908
what are you guys doing?
I thought i told you to run.

01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:07.613
Who are you?

01:11:12.049 --> 01:11:15.317
David?

01:11:15.319 --> 01:11:18.720
I said, who are you?

01:11:18.722 --> 01:11:20.859
Does anyone know
you live in here?

01:11:25.362 --> 01:11:29.331
David, i know all about you.

01:11:29.333 --> 01:11:31.199
You do?

01:11:31.201 --> 01:11:33.034
How?

01:11:33.036 --> 01:11:38.306
I know you used to live here
as a child, right?

01:11:38.308 --> 01:11:41.077
Nurse hemming
took care of you.

01:11:41.079 --> 01:11:44.046
She was my mommy.

01:11:44.048 --> 01:11:46.982
She was a mother
to a lot of people.

01:11:46.984 --> 01:11:50.720
And i know that the doctor
took your mom away from you,

01:11:50.722 --> 01:11:51.923
didn't he?

01:11:56.494 --> 01:12:01.165
You kept all these things because
this is the only life you know.

01:12:03.968 --> 01:12:05.467
Are you hurting people
who come here

01:12:05.469 --> 01:12:07.869
because you think they want
to destroy your home?

01:12:07.871 --> 01:12:09.738
Not my home.

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:12.408
Mommy's home! You and your
friends can't take it!

01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:15.877
- What?
- I won't let you destroy my mom's home!

01:12:15.879 --> 01:12:17.979
She was a good mom,

01:12:17.981 --> 01:12:19.180
wasn't she?

01:12:19.182 --> 01:12:22.118
She was the best mommy.

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.220
And you just wanna
give other kids

01:12:24.222 --> 01:12:26.822
the chance to have a mom
as good as yours, right?

01:12:26.824 --> 01:12:30.493
I want her to help all of the
boys like she helped me.

01:12:30.495 --> 01:12:34.063
But can't you see
you're hurting them?

01:12:34.065 --> 01:12:36.297
What happened to the other
little boys before these ones?

01:12:36.299 --> 01:12:38.833
Oh, they're sleeping.

01:12:38.835 --> 01:12:42.037
Mommy's taking care of them.

01:12:42.039 --> 01:12:44.006
You like to play trucks?

01:12:44.008 --> 01:12:45.507
Right?

01:12:45.509 --> 01:12:48.978
If you really wanna
help these kids,

01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:50.345
you need to let them go.

01:12:50.347 --> 01:12:51.546
It's an, look...

01:12:51.548 --> 01:12:53.983
how can mommy
take care of them?

01:12:53.985 --> 01:12:57.353
They have their own mothers.

01:12:57.355 --> 01:13:02.026
No! No, i want only
my mommy.

01:13:05.029 --> 01:13:06.060
Run!

01:13:06.062 --> 01:13:08.430
No, please come back!

01:13:08.432 --> 01:13:10.198
You let them leave.

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.436
She's their mother, she wants to
help all of us!

01:13:43.234 --> 01:13:45.935
- Why are we going here?
- Richard showed me something earlier today

01:13:45.937 --> 01:13:48.369
about a psychiatric hospital,
where some doctors went nuts

01:13:48.371 --> 01:13:50.305
and killed
a bunch of people.

01:13:50.307 --> 01:13:53.274
The kids like to play some game
that sounds a lot like that.

01:13:53.276 --> 01:13:55.176
So, they might
have come here.

01:13:55.178 --> 01:13:56.878
Isn't that a long shot?

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.148
Listen, we're in the same
town as that hospital.

01:13:59.150 --> 01:14:02.117
The kids like to play some
messed up murder-doctor game.

01:14:02.119 --> 01:14:04.353
Didn't you ever have some
spooky place near your house

01:14:04.355 --> 01:14:06.988
when you were growing up, that
you couldn't stay away from?

01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:09.425
Yeah, sure. That didn't mean
i'm gonna run off there

01:14:09.427 --> 01:14:11.196
and spend any length
of time there.

01:14:14.632 --> 01:14:16.268
Huh. Look at that.

01:14:32.215 --> 01:14:34.285
No! No! No!

01:14:39.022 --> 01:14:40.221
It's all right.
Stand back.

01:14:40.223 --> 01:14:41.359
Stand back.

01:14:50.433 --> 01:14:51.934
What's happening, boys?
What's going on?

01:14:51.936 --> 01:14:53.402
I don't know.
This guy took us.

01:14:53.404 --> 01:14:55.336
I'm sorry. We were
supposed to play doctor.

01:14:55.338 --> 01:14:57.939
It's okay, it's okay. You're not
in trouble. Where's the man?

01:14:57.941 --> 01:15:00.074
- Are there other people in there?
- He's up there.

01:15:00.076 --> 01:15:02.644
- And he's hurting people.
- I'll be fine. Ellis, call for back up

01:15:02.646 --> 01:15:07.416
- and medic support!
- And then i'll call your mom.

01:15:07.418 --> 01:15:09.184
Richard!

01:15:09.186 --> 01:15:10.989
Richard,
where are you?

01:15:21.264 --> 01:15:27.269
Oh, my god.

01:15:27.271 --> 01:15:30.171
No, wait!

01:15:30.173 --> 01:15:32.576
Wait.
Wait!

01:15:53.196 --> 01:15:56.698
Why are you doing this?

01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:58.302
Richard!

01:16:02.306 --> 01:16:03.975
Rich!

01:16:22.625 --> 01:16:24.560
Sorry.

01:16:26.062 --> 01:16:27.061
Richard?

01:16:27.063 --> 01:16:29.198
Richard.
Oh, my god.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.300
Richard.

01:16:31.302 --> 01:16:35.503
Oh, my god.

01:16:35.505 --> 01:16:37.706
Help! Here!
He's half breathing.

01:16:37.708 --> 01:16:40.408
I still feel a pulse.
Let's get him down!

01:16:40.410 --> 01:16:43.545
Richard!
Oh, my god.

01:16:43.547 --> 01:16:46.148
There's a man upstairs with a
gunshot wound in his shoulder,

01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:49.150
arrest him, he tried
to kill richard.

01:16:49.152 --> 01:16:51.423
- Please.
- All right, i got this.

01:17:05.302 --> 01:17:07.237
Oh, christ.

01:17:09.706 --> 01:17:12.274
Put your hands
where i can see them!

01:17:12.276 --> 01:17:13.509
Dr. Pender?

01:17:13.511 --> 01:17:15.310
Hands where i can see them!

01:17:15.312 --> 01:17:16.644
We won't ask again.

01:17:16.646 --> 01:17:20.114
No dr. Pender,
please don't!

01:17:20.116 --> 01:17:21.783
