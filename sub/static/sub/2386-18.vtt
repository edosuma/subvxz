WEBVTT

00:02.012 --> 00:04.880
<i>Kids, 2012 started out</i>
<i>kind of crazy.</i>

00:05.544 --> 00:07.478
Barney met a girl named Quinn,

00:07.480 --> 00:09.463
<i>Kevin unproposed to Robin,</i>

00:09.465 --> 00:10.731
<i>I told Robin...</i>

00:10.733 --> 00:12.099
I love you, Robin.

00:12.101 --> 00:12.933
<i>When I asked if she</i>

00:12.935 --> 00:14.852
<i>loved me back, she said...</i>

00:14.854 --> 00:16.570
No.

00:16.572 --> 00:17.721
<i>Marshall told Robin...</i>

00:17.723 --> 00:19.690
You got to move out.

00:19.692 --> 00:22.810
<i>And Robin did.</i>

00:29.918 --> 00:32.803
I can't even open
her bedroom door anymore.

00:33.538 --> 00:35.506
Why do I have
to be so sensitive?

00:35.508 --> 00:37.791
I don't know, bro.

00:37.793 --> 00:39.009
Look at me and that Quinn chick.

00:39.011 --> 00:40.294
You don't hear me
prattling on

00:40.296 --> 00:42.513
about how beautiful
her smile is,

00:42.515 --> 00:46.550
how her hair is like a waterfall
of honey-colored silk,

00:46.552 --> 00:49.970
how her eyes are like
a warm South Sea

00:49.972 --> 00:53.256
kissed by the fire
and gold of sunrise.

00:53.258 --> 00:55.258
I don't even remember
what she looks like.

00:55.260 --> 00:57.260
Dude, you obviously like her.
Can't you read

00:57.262 --> 00:58.445
between the lines, Ted?

00:58.447 --> 00:59.780
I obviously like her.

00:59.782 --> 01:01.365
How did this happen to me?

01:01.367 --> 01:04.601
When did I become such
a gooey romantic?

01:06.070 --> 01:07.488
Look, I think it's healthy

01:07.490 --> 01:10.240
that you have real feelings
for a woman

01:10.242 --> 01:12.242
instead of just seeing her
as an object.

01:12.244 --> 01:13.577
Switch?

01:13.579 --> 01:14.294
Sure.

01:15.714 --> 01:16.747
But why Quinn?

01:16.749 --> 01:18.281
I mean, you spent
one night with her,

01:18.283 --> 01:19.449
and she was kind of mean.

01:19.451 --> 01:20.834
We just connected.

01:20.836 --> 01:23.787
Emotionally, intellectually,
spiritually.

01:23.789 --> 01:24.755
So, mind-blowing sex?

01:24.757 --> 01:27.558
Mind-blowing sex!

01:27.560 --> 01:31.228
For an hour afterwards,
I couldn't uncross my eyes.

01:31.230 --> 01:33.981
Which was awesome, because
when I went back for seconds,

01:33.983 --> 01:36.316
it was like having
a three-way with twins.

01:36.318 --> 01:38.402
So... call her.

01:38.404 --> 01:40.637
I would if I knew how
to get in touch with her,

01:40.639 --> 01:42.573
but I can't,
and it's driving me crazy.

01:42.575 --> 01:43.774
Everywhere I look,
I see her.

01:43.776 --> 01:45.192
I see her walking on the street;

01:45.194 --> 01:47.811
I see her shopping in the store;

01:47.813 --> 01:49.830
I see her dancing on that pole.

01:49.832 --> 01:51.915
I see her dancing
on that pole, too.

01:51.917 --> 01:54.251
Oh, my God, that's Quinn.

01:54.253 --> 01:57.437
Gentlemen,
give it up for Karma.

02:11.436 --> 02:13.053
I really appreciate
you guys taking me in.

02:13.055 --> 02:14.104
I mean,

02:14.106 --> 02:15.606
I'm homeless,

02:15.608 --> 02:17.858
things between me and Ted
are still kind of weird.

02:17.860 --> 02:20.143
So, it's nice
to be around friends.

02:20.145 --> 02:21.979
Well, stay as long
as you want, sweetie.

02:21.981 --> 02:23.179
Oh, thank you.

02:23.181 --> 02:24.531
Mm.

02:24.533 --> 02:26.700
Now, I got you a journal.

02:26.702 --> 02:27.951
I know this sounds lame,

02:27.953 --> 02:30.621
but it really helps work
through stuff to write about it.

02:30.623 --> 02:31.955
Oh.

02:31.957 --> 02:34.691
"Dear Diary. The fantasies
of killing Marshall's mom

02:34.693 --> 02:35.876
"have become more vivid.

02:35.878 --> 02:37.861
Today, I scalped her with a ..""
Whoops,

02:37.863 --> 02:39.663
that one's mine.

02:40.748 --> 02:42.631
You are going to have
so much fun here.

02:42.635 --> 02:45.469
Oh, guys, please, do not feel like you
have to keep me entertained.

02:45.804 --> 02:47.704
Well, you shouldn't have come
to East Meadow, Long Island,

02:47.706 --> 02:49.506
Robin, if you didn't want
to be entertained.

02:49.508 --> 02:51.808
Really? I didn't think
there was a ton to do here.

02:51.810 --> 02:54.144
Oh, apparently, someone
hasn't heard

02:54.146 --> 02:56.263
of the Uniondale
Miniatures Museum.

02:56.265 --> 02:58.482
You'll come for
the 19th century thimble art,

02:58.484 --> 03:02.069
but you'll stay for the
Dutch masters on bottle caps.

03:02.071 --> 03:02.936
Plus,

03:02.938 --> 03:04.104
you'll be bowling
with two

03:04.106 --> 03:07.441
charter members of the
East Meadow Alley Cats.

03:08.109 --> 03:09.159
"We're a hot dog eating team

03:09.161 --> 03:10.861
with a bowling problem."

03:10.863 --> 03:11.862
Shirley

03:11.864 --> 03:13.396
came up with that one.

03:13.398 --> 03:14.448
Great bowler, Shirley.

03:14.450 --> 03:16.450
She hit 280 the other day.

03:16.452 --> 03:20.053
Unfortunately,
that was on her bathroom scale.

03:20.838 --> 03:22.122
<i>When Robin moved out,</i>

03:22.124 --> 03:23.907
<i>there was a hole in my life</i>

03:23.909 --> 03:25.792
<i>in the shape</i>
<i>of an empty bedroom.</i>

03:25.794 --> 03:28.411
<i>I filled it with a new hobby.</i>

03:31.583 --> 03:33.300
What are you doing
in my old room?

03:33.302 --> 03:35.135
This room being empty
was bumming me out,

03:35.137 --> 03:36.853
so I decided
to do something healthy

03:36.855 --> 03:38.305
that would take my mind off you.

03:38.307 --> 03:39.756
Well, nothing says healthy

03:39.758 --> 03:41.892
like smoking 40 pounds
of pork loin

03:41.894 --> 03:43.226
in an unventilated room

03:43.228 --> 03:45.729
while having an imaginary
conversation with your ex.

03:45.731 --> 03:48.031
Just for that,
you're not getting any.

03:48.033 --> 03:49.232
I'm not getting any?

03:49.234 --> 03:51.101
You're the one smoking
your own meat.

03:51.103 --> 03:52.152
Oh!

03:53.989 --> 03:56.707
What am I gonna do
about this Quinn thing?

03:56.709 --> 03:58.108
I want to ask her out again,

03:58.110 --> 04:00.210
but I don't know how I feel
about her being a stripper.

04:00.212 --> 04:02.829
Why would you have
an issue with that?

04:02.831 --> 04:05.465
I mean, you've dated convicted
felons, arms dealers...

04:05.467 --> 04:07.050
pageant moms.

04:07.052 --> 04:11.004
Hey, Quinn is someone I might
want to get serious with,

04:11.006 --> 04:15.475
not just pretend to be a judge

04:15.477 --> 04:18.728
Tiffany's mom <i>really</i>
wanted that tiara.

04:18.731 --> 04:21.798
In a city of eight
million people,

04:21.800 --> 04:24.901
you happened to walk into
the club where she works?

04:24.903 --> 04:25.936
Maybe it's destiny.

04:25.938 --> 04:28.322
No, Destiny strips
at The Melon Patch.

04:28.324 --> 04:30.924
They're people, Ted;
try to keep them straight.

04:31.659 --> 04:33.593
Wait a minute.

04:33.595 --> 04:36.780
What if this is destiny?

04:36.782 --> 04:37.664
I just said...

04:37.666 --> 04:39.282
What if the universe

04:39.284 --> 04:42.336
is throwing us in each other's
path for some reason?

04:42.338 --> 04:43.537
More or less exactly what I...

04:43.539 --> 04:46.322
I don't care what you say,
this is destiny!

04:46.324 --> 04:47.374
Damn it, Ted!

04:47.376 --> 04:49.626
Why can't you ever root
for love?

04:55.516 --> 04:56.499
Hey.

04:56.501 --> 04:58.135
Hey.

04:58.137 --> 04:59.269
Quinn...

04:59.271 --> 05:00.437
No, listen,

05:00.439 --> 05:02.406
in here I'm Karma, okay?

05:02.408 --> 05:03.506
Got it.

05:03.508 --> 05:04.808
Uh, look, Karma,

05:04.810 --> 05:05.809
I swear

05:05.811 --> 05:07.994
I never say crap
like this, but...

05:07.996 --> 05:09.196
I think maybe
the universe

05:09.198 --> 05:11.581
is telling us something.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.183
You want to go out again?

05:13.185 --> 05:15.569
I'm sorry,
I don't date customers.

05:15.571 --> 05:16.870
What about destiny?

05:16.872 --> 05:18.789
I heard she's
over at The Melon Patch now.

05:18.791 --> 05:22.492
No, I mean like fate telling us
that we're supposed to be...

05:22.494 --> 05:23.660
Oh, listen, Barney,

05:23.662 --> 05:25.912
my manager is really
giving me the stink eye.

05:25.914 --> 05:27.798
I have to get back to work.

05:27.800 --> 05:28.832
Okay, wait, wait.

05:28.834 --> 05:30.550
What if I pay for a dance?

05:30.552 --> 05:31.501
That way,

05:31.503 --> 05:32.586
your manager's happy,

05:32.588 --> 05:33.920
and then I can to tell you

05:33.922 --> 05:35.705
why you should go on
another date with me.

05:35.707 --> 05:38.475
I guess there's
no reason why not.

05:38.477 --> 05:41.211
Okay, first off,
we have a lot in common.

05:41.213 --> 05:42.596
For example,

05:42.598 --> 05:44.714
both of our jobs
are largely financed

05:44.716 --> 05:47.901
by drunk Asian businessmen.

05:47.903 --> 05:49.770
<i>Dear Diary.</i>

05:49.772 --> 05:51.772
It is day four on this island,

05:51.774 --> 05:54.107
<i>which the natives have dubbed</i>
<i>"Long Island,"</i>

05:54.109 --> 05:55.575
<i>perhaps referencing</i>

05:55.577 --> 05:58.412
<i>how each hour here feels</i>
<i>like it may never end.</i>

05:58.414 --> 06:00.697
<i>So far, they have welcomed me</i>

06:00.699 --> 06:04.734
<i>and given me a rare glimpse</i>
<i>into their bizarre way of life.</i>

06:04.736 --> 06:07.904
<i>By "entertainment," they mean</i>
<i>table shuffle board,</i>

06:07.906 --> 06:12.008
<i>macramé classes, and other</i>
<i>non-stimulating activities</i>

06:12.010 --> 06:13.794
<i>which are only used</i>
<i>in Manhattan</i>

06:13.796 --> 06:17.264
<i>to calm down drug addicts</i>
<i>and the criminally insane.</i>

06:17.266 --> 06:21.034
<i>A preliterate society,</i>
<i>their menus display pictures</i>

06:21.036 --> 06:23.253
<i>of the food they offer,</i>

06:23.255 --> 06:25.522
<i>everyone is forced</i>
<i>to sing "Happy Birthday"</i>

06:25.524 --> 06:28.091
<i>four or five times a meal,</i>

06:28.093 --> 06:31.978
<i>and dessert</i>
<i>has fireworks in it.</i>

06:31.980 --> 06:35.115
In their lairs, they often don
<i>a primitive shroud</i>

06:35.117 --> 06:38.819
<i>called a "Snugget,"</i>
<i>and it is not uncommon for them</i>

06:38.821 --> 06:40.937
<i>to go to sleep before 9 p.m.,</i>

06:40.939 --> 06:42.772
<i>fearing, as they do,</i>

06:42.774 --> 06:44.407
<i>the night.</i>

06:45.460 --> 06:47.527
<i>Also Diary, I think writing</i>
<i>in you is stupid,</i>

06:47.529 --> 06:48.795
but you were a gift from Lily,

06:48.797 --> 06:50.330
<i>and she's watching</i>
<i>me right now.</i>

06:50.332 --> 06:53.884
Guys, um, I don't want
to overstay my welcome,

06:53.886 --> 06:56.619
and Patrice said that she would
take me off your hands.

06:56.621 --> 06:59.639
So, do you have
a train schedule or...

06:59.641 --> 07:00.891
Oh, yeah,

07:00.893 --> 07:01.892
um, but-but

07:01.894 --> 07:04.728
there's a-a problem
with the train.

07:04.730 --> 07:06.429
Big, big problem.

07:06.431 --> 07:07.330
There was a...

07:07.332 --> 07:09.599
Strike.
A lightning strike.

07:09.601 --> 07:12.802
That hit one of the picketers
who was on strike.

07:12.804 --> 07:14.938
During a thunderstorm.

07:14.940 --> 07:18.942
Plus,

07:18.944 --> 07:22.078
Yeah, she probably doesn't
even want you there.

07:26.083 --> 07:27.501
You guys are being weird.

07:28.035 --> 07:30.670
Oh!
Oh!

07:30.672 --> 07:33.323
Oh, my God, Robin,
I am so sorry.

07:33.325 --> 07:34.925
I'll throw these in the wash.

07:34.927 --> 07:37.844
They'll be dry
and folded in the morning.

07:37.846 --> 07:39.329
Or the weekend.

07:39.331 --> 07:40.997
And we can talk
about you leaving then.

07:40.999 --> 07:42.349
Or never.

07:42.351 --> 07:44.851
Wait, Lily, why don't...

07:44.853 --> 07:46.853
It's 8:45,
time to hit the hay.

07:46.855 --> 07:48.939
Good night!

07:54.812 --> 07:56.646
So Ted, what healthy,

07:56.648 --> 07:59.182
not-at-all-crazy activity
are you up to now?

07:59.184 --> 08:02.852
I liked smoking meat,
but now I've got a new passion:

08:02.854 --> 08:04.454
wood.

08:04.456 --> 08:07.490
You hear these things that come
out of your mouth, right?

08:13.130 --> 08:15.198
So I went back to
the Lusty Leopard.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.716
You know what, Barney?

08:16.718 --> 08:19.753
I know I said I have a rule
about not dating customers,

08:19.755 --> 08:23.657
but you may have
convinced me to...

08:23.659 --> 08:25.208
Oh.

08:25.210 --> 08:26.643
Song's over, I got to go.

08:26.645 --> 08:28.878
Wait, no, what?
Convinced you to what?

08:28.880 --> 08:31.848
I'm sorry, but manager's
giving me the stink eye.

08:31.850 --> 08:34.150
Ugh, get a life, Manager.

08:35.186 --> 08:36.719
What were you saying?

08:36.721 --> 08:39.139
Well, I was going to say

08:39.140 --> 08:42.826
that I do find you
very... charming.

08:43.561 --> 08:45.362
And funny...

08:45.364 --> 08:46.813
and sexy.

08:46.815 --> 08:49.666
And exciting and smart.

08:49.668 --> 08:52.002
You so get me.

08:52.004 --> 08:53.703
You know what, Barney?

08:53.705 --> 08:56.206
I have never done
this before,

08:56.208 --> 08:59.909
but there's just
something about you.

08:59.911 --> 09:01.595
So I guess my answer is...

09:01.597 --> 09:03.129
Oh.

09:03.131 --> 09:04.130
The song's over.

09:04.132 --> 09:05.849
Well, just finish the thought!

09:05.851 --> 09:07.384
But the manager.
God,

09:07.386 --> 09:08.385
I hate manager.

09:10.322 --> 09:12.689
There. Your answer is...

09:12.691 --> 09:15.108
Maybe if we knew each other
a little better.

09:16.094 --> 09:17.110
Tell me about yourself.

09:17.112 --> 09:19.112
Well, um, what can I tell you?

09:19.114 --> 09:20.113
I'm, um...

09:20.115 --> 09:22.282
charming and funny

09:22.284 --> 09:24.901
and sexy and...

09:24.903 --> 09:28.455
exciting and smart.

09:28.457 --> 09:30.457
Well, how can a girl
say no to that?

09:30.459 --> 09:32.826
How about we...

09:32.828 --> 09:34.794
go out on...

09:34.796 --> 09:38.581
aaaaaaaaa...

09:38.583 --> 09:40.417
aaaaaa...

09:40.419 --> 09:42.135
Ugh, these songs are so short.

09:45.072 --> 09:48.591
Uh, how much exactly
did you give Quinn?

09:48.593 --> 09:50.060
Eight, nine hundred bucks,

09:50.062 --> 09:52.896
plus whatever
my Rolex is worth.

09:52.898 --> 09:54.064
Whoa.

09:54.066 --> 09:55.098
I know.

09:55.100 --> 09:58.134
Ted, I think I'm in love.

10:05.786 --> 10:07.404
Quinn is totally playing you.

10:07.406 --> 10:08.371
What?

10:08.373 --> 10:09.856
That's ridiculous.

10:09.858 --> 10:11.091
If she were playing me,

10:11.093 --> 10:13.076
why would she agree
to go on a date with me?

10:13.078 --> 10:15.495
You're different than
the rest of these schlubs.

10:15.497 --> 10:18.998
This one time only,
I'm going to break my rule.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.864
Let's go out tomorrow night.

10:20.889 --> 10:22.089
Sweet!

10:22.147 --> 10:25.509
Oh, shoot!
I have to work tomorrow. Ugh!

10:25.996 --> 10:28.027
Hey! Brainstorm!

10:28.052 --> 10:29.797
What if we just have
our date here,

10:30.489 --> 10:31.861
It's a date.

10:32.312 --> 10:36.163
It's not a date, if you go into a
strip club and paying for lap dances.

10:36.164 --> 10:39.072
If it's not a date, why'd she
say, every fifth day was free?

10:39.104 --> 10:40.887
Because that's
the Lusty Leopard's policy

10:40.889 --> 10:43.556
on Friday nights, and I'm so mad
at you that I know that!

10:43.558 --> 10:47.243
<i>Dear Diary.</i>

10:47.245 --> 10:49.162
<i>It is day six on this island,</i>

10:49.164 --> 10:52.882
<i>and I begin to fear I am</i>
<i>more captive than guest...</i>

10:54.786 --> 10:56.169
Morning, sweetie.

10:56.171 --> 10:58.171
Up for croquet?

10:59.206 --> 11:01.574
Hey, uh, Lil, are you done

11:01.576 --> 11:03.710
washing my clothes yet?
Because I...

11:03.712 --> 11:04.928
Oh, I am so sorry.

11:04.930 --> 11:07.013
Your clothes accidentally
wound up in the bag

11:07.015 --> 11:09.065
I donated to Goodwill.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.250
You gave away my clothes?

11:11.252 --> 11:14.220
They were a bit fancy
for East Meadow.

11:14.222 --> 11:16.389
People were staring.

11:16.391 --> 11:19.976
Besides, we have
an extra Snugget.

11:21.095 --> 11:22.645
Try it.

11:23.931 --> 11:25.815
Try it, Robin.

11:27.735 --> 11:29.736
<i>They're trying to make me</i>
<i>one of them, Diary.</i>

11:29.738 --> 11:32.655
<i>And I begin to fear...</i>

11:32.657 --> 11:35.041
<i>I may like it!</i>

11:37.628 --> 11:39.629
I can't believe we're
at a strip club,

11:39.631 --> 11:41.931
and the biggest boob
in here is you.

11:41.933 --> 11:44.300
It's a real date, Ted.

11:44.302 --> 11:47.303
And clearly you haven't
seen the DeSalvo twins.

11:47.305 --> 11:48.555
She's right over there.

11:48.557 --> 11:50.640
Barney...
Yowza!

11:50.642 --> 11:53.292
You are not on a date.

11:53.294 --> 11:54.611
Okay, look, prove it.

11:54.613 --> 11:57.180
Prove that she's not just
taking advantage of you.

11:57.182 --> 11:59.599
Get her to go out with
you anywhere but here.

11:59.601 --> 12:00.850
Fine!

12:00.852 --> 12:03.319
Hey, sexy! You want a dance?

12:03.321 --> 12:04.654
Yeah!

12:04.656 --> 12:06.156
Uh, one thing, though.

12:06.158 --> 12:08.491
Um, you'd be okay
with us having a date

12:08.493 --> 12:10.309
somewhere besides here,
wouldn't you?

12:10.311 --> 12:12.862
I was hoping you would ask that.

12:12.864 --> 12:15.582
I'm sorry it's
so expensive in here,

12:15.584 --> 12:17.700
but it's nice and private, huh?

12:17.702 --> 12:19.169
Absolutely. And romantic!

12:19.171 --> 12:21.287
It's our first getaway
as a couple!

12:22.656 --> 12:23.990
It's become clear to me, Diary,

12:23.992 --> 12:25.875
<i>that I must attempt</i>
<i>a dramatic escape.</i>

12:25.877 --> 12:29.095
<i>I will fake a stomach ache</i>
<i>during dinner.</i>

12:29.097 --> 12:31.297
<i>Then, after Marshall and Lily</i>
<i>leave for bingo night,</i>

12:31.299 --> 12:33.433
<i>I will sneak out the back.</i>

12:33.435 --> 12:36.302
<i>I'll swipe Shirley's Rascal</i>
<i>and drive to the train station.</i>

12:36.304 --> 12:38.337
<i>Shirley's 42, by the way,</i>
<i>and rides a Rascal.</i>

12:38.339 --> 12:42.192
<i>I swear, it's the second half</i>
<i>of</i> Wall-E out here.

12:44.345 --> 12:46.029
Bingo...

12:47.081 --> 12:49.866
was canceled.

12:53.571 --> 12:56.506
Hey, sexy, you want a dance?

12:56.508 --> 12:58.875
No,
I'm not a customer.

12:58.877 --> 13:00.359
My girlfriend works here.

13:00.361 --> 13:03.162
She's right over...

13:03.164 --> 13:05.632
This one time only,
I'm gonna break my rule.

13:05.634 --> 13:07.083
Let's go out tomorrow night!

13:07.085 --> 13:08.034
Sweet!

13:08.036 --> 13:09.319
Oh, shoot!

13:09.321 --> 13:12.438
I have to work tomorrow. Ugh!

13:12.440 --> 13:13.673
Hey! Brainstorm!

13:13.675 --> 13:15.592
What if we just have
our date here,

13:15.594 --> 13:19.045
maybe in
the Champagne Room?

13:21.214 --> 13:23.750
That was our spot.

13:28.810 --> 13:30.427
Hey, gorgeous,
You want a dance?

13:31.429 --> 13:32.863
Is it a jig?

13:32.865 --> 13:34.965
'Cause if so, it's up.

13:35.633 --> 13:37.200
Sorry, I only had the last verse

13:37.202 --> 13:39.703
of "Hot For Teacher" to work
on that. What was that?

13:39.705 --> 13:43.606
You laid exactly the same line
on that guy that you did on me!

13:43.608 --> 13:44.624
Sweetie, that is just something

13:44.626 --> 13:47.294
I say to these
gullible losers here.

13:47.296 --> 13:48.912
They fall for it every time.

13:48.914 --> 13:52.716
Bunch of losers!

13:52.718 --> 13:54.718
Oh, gosh, manager again.

13:54.720 --> 13:55.919
He's looking at me like,

13:55.921 --> 13:57.671
"Karma, why aren't you booking
more time

13:57.673 --> 13:58.838
in the Champagne Room?"

13:58.840 --> 14:01.174
Well, we'll show him.

14:01.176 --> 14:03.793
No! You're playing me again!

14:03.795 --> 14:06.346
And you're not even trying hard!

14:06.348 --> 14:08.148
There's no manager there;
You're pointing at a fern!

14:09.984 --> 14:11.601
Ted was right.

14:11.603 --> 14:14.454
I bet he's home right now,
laughing at how dumb I am.

14:19.911 --> 14:22.612
Did I deserve this?
Absolutely.

14:22.614 --> 14:25.615
I have told
some outrageous lies.

14:25.617 --> 14:27.968
I have told women I was famous,

14:27.970 --> 14:29.336
a war hero,

14:29.338 --> 14:31.821
that sex with me would cure
their nearsightedness.

14:31.823 --> 14:33.456
Barney?!

14:35.343 --> 14:38.762
I probably deserved everything
you did to me and more.

14:38.764 --> 14:40.430
But I have been trying,

14:40.432 --> 14:43.416
and trying hard
to be a better person.

14:44.135 --> 14:45.185
Thanks for showing me

14:45.187 --> 14:46.736
I had it right before.

14:54.228 --> 14:58.064
Look, I'm sorry we made you feel
a little suffocated,

14:58.066 --> 15:01.451
but were you really
just gonna sneak away?

15:01.453 --> 15:04.371
Well, it's just...
I really miss the city.

15:04.373 --> 15:06.706
I know you guys love it here,
and that's fine,

15:06.708 --> 15:08.024
We don't love it here!

15:08.026 --> 15:08.691
What?

15:08.693 --> 15:09.859
Come on, Robin,

15:09.861 --> 15:11.878
what kind
of life is this?

15:11.880 --> 15:13.463
Going to canasta tournaments

15:13.465 --> 15:15.165
and high school
field hockey playoffs?

15:15.167 --> 15:17.751
Oh, I think North Bellmore
can take state.

15:17.753 --> 15:19.753
With Sophie's ankle?
Doubtful.

15:19.755 --> 15:21.888
Okay, but if you two
are so unhappy,

15:21.890 --> 15:23.890
why don't you just move
back to Manhattan?

15:23.892 --> 15:26.593
Because the suburbs are
better for the baby.

15:26.595 --> 15:29.729
Who says? Who says any place
is better for the baby

15:29.731 --> 15:31.931
if you two are unhappy in it?

15:33.884 --> 15:36.386
No, no,
we live here now.

15:37.054 --> 15:38.772
And, you know,
this place

15:38.774 --> 15:40.240
wouldn't seem
so bad if...

15:40.242 --> 15:43.126
we got one of our friends
to move out here.

15:43.778 --> 15:45.561
Oh, guys...

15:45.563 --> 15:48.531
Oh...

15:48.533 --> 15:51.267
I would rather set myself
on fire.

15:52.586 --> 15:55.571
<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>Barney learned that even in</i>

15:55.573 --> 15:58.875
a city of eight million people,
<i>there's no escaping Karma.</i>

16:06.084 --> 16:07.100
Oh.

16:07.102 --> 16:08.768
Oh, hey.

16:08.770 --> 16:11.554
Sorry, can't talk;
manager's watching.

16:13.474 --> 16:14.524
Look, I am sorry

16:14.526 --> 16:16.443
if I hurt your feelings;
it's a job.

16:16.445 --> 16:17.811
Yeah, well, at my job,

16:17.813 --> 16:19.729
we don't rip out
people's hearts for money.

16:19.731 --> 16:24.317
My company briefly backed
a lab in North Korea

16:24.319 --> 16:26.403
which did, but we sold it!

16:26.405 --> 16:28.321
You know, I've worked
at that club for a year.

16:28.323 --> 16:29.706
You practically live there,

16:29.708 --> 16:31.658
and you didn't even recognize me
the night we went out.

16:31.660 --> 16:34.777
You can't pretend to be some
hurt little victim with me.

16:34.779 --> 16:35.829
I know you.

16:35.831 --> 16:37.047
Well, of course you do.

16:37.049 --> 16:38.614
I told you things
I don't tell anybody.

16:38.616 --> 16:39.799
I was honest with you.

16:39.801 --> 16:41.918
Yeah, because I believe you have
a gay black brother,

16:41.920 --> 16:43.636
a friend lonely enough
to smoke his own meat

16:43.638 --> 16:45.472
and that your mom was a groupie
for Supertramp.

16:45.474 --> 16:48.508
They named
their band for her!

16:50.845 --> 16:52.628
You remembered all that?

16:52.630 --> 16:55.014
Well, yeah.
I mean,

16:55.016 --> 16:56.299
you're more interesting
than the lyrics

16:56.301 --> 16:58.935
to "Pour Some Sugar On Me"
for the 8,000th time.

17:00.938 --> 17:02.522
You know, it's funny.

17:02.524 --> 17:05.692
Almost every woman
I've ever met was wrong

17:05.694 --> 17:07.310
to give me a chance.

17:07.311 --> 17:10.463
You're the first woman
who's wrong not to.

17:13.817 --> 17:15.117
Large black coffee...

17:15.119 --> 17:18.154
and whatever he's having.

17:18.156 --> 17:19.756
It's on me.

17:20.656 --> 17:23.009
The same.

17:23.011 --> 17:24.426
Thank you.

17:24.429 --> 17:26.846
You're welcome.

17:26.848 --> 17:29.849
1,700 more of these
and we're even.

17:29.851 --> 17:31.834
Uh, the song just ended.

17:31.836 --> 17:33.669
That mean you got
to get going?

17:33.671 --> 17:35.972
No.

17:35.974 --> 17:38.024
Do you have time
to sit with me?

17:38.026 --> 17:40.794
I don't know.
You're wearing my watch.

17:44.031 --> 17:46.733
Pottery.
Now you're making pottery.

17:46.735 --> 17:48.618
I needed a new vase...

17:48.620 --> 17:50.520
and some plates.

17:50.522 --> 17:51.788
And bowls.

17:51.790 --> 17:54.207
The china cabinet I built had
some design flaws.

17:54.209 --> 17:56.960
Why don't you just turn
this into a guest room?

17:56.962 --> 17:58.328
A guest room?

17:58.330 --> 18:00.363
You mean
a room ready and waiting

18:00.365 --> 18:01.697
for someone who isn't there?

18:01.699 --> 18:04.918
A room devoted to reminding me
that I'm still alone?

18:04.920 --> 18:08.338
Yeah, I don't need that.

18:08.340 --> 18:13.176
Ted, no matter how many things
you put in this room...

18:13.178 --> 18:15.445
I'll still be here.

18:27.057 --> 18:27.723
Hey.

18:27.725 --> 18:29.909
Hey!

18:30.394 --> 18:31.778
Come on in.

18:31.780 --> 18:33.746
Thanks.

18:34.849 --> 18:37.283
Oh, um, thanks for packing up
the rest of my stuff.

18:37.285 --> 18:39.619
No problem. Uh, you
want some coffee?

18:39.621 --> 18:41.955
Uh, sure. Yeah?
Yeah.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.407
So, how are things?

18:44.409 --> 18:46.376
Good! You?
Great!

18:46.378 --> 18:48.361
You know, I actually
made this mug.

18:48.363 --> 18:49.929
Oh, yeah? Oh!
Yeah. Oh!

18:49.931 --> 18:52.599
Yeah, sorry, coffee's
a little strong.

18:53.717 --> 18:56.269
How was your stay
with Marshall and Lily?

18:56.271 --> 18:58.304
Uh... a little weird.

18:58.306 --> 19:00.440
They're not loving Long Island.

19:00.442 --> 19:01.608
Oh.

19:01.610 --> 19:03.142
I think deep down, they realize

19:03.144 --> 19:05.111
it just... isn't a good fit.

19:05.113 --> 19:08.698
It's hard to admit that
sometimes.

19:08.700 --> 19:10.567
Sure is.

19:10.569 --> 19:13.870
But I guess it's better
to face it and move on

19:13.872 --> 19:18.575
than try to force something that
just isn't meant to be, right?

19:18.577 --> 19:20.293
I think so.

19:20.295 --> 19:21.644
Yeah.

19:22.379 --> 19:23.546
So, what do you think

19:23.548 --> 19:25.098
you're gonna do
with my old room?

19:25.100 --> 19:26.616
Haven't really thought about it.

19:26.618 --> 19:28.284
Oh!

19:34.275 --> 19:36.509
Who needs Manhattan?

19:36.511 --> 19:37.844
Yeah.

19:39.964 --> 19:41.964
Hmm, it's Ted.
He wants to know

19:41.966 --> 19:43.983
if we want to hang
out in the city.

19:43.985 --> 19:45.852
The next train leaves
in nine minutes.

20:03.203 --> 20:06.956
<i>Dear Lily and Marshall,</i>
<i>I don't know if you know this,</i>

20:06.958 --> 20:09.959
<i>but I never took</i>
<i>your names off the lease.</i>

20:09.961 --> 20:13.663
<i>Well, today</i>
<i>I took my name off it.</i>

20:13.665 --> 20:16.666
<i>The apartment is now yours.</i>

20:16.668 --> 20:19.502
<i>And I think I finally figured</i>
<i>out the best thing</i>

20:19.504 --> 20:21.471
<i>to do with Robin's old room.</i>

20:30.314 --> 20:33.983
<i>See, for me, this place has</i>
<i>begun to feel a little haunted.</i>

20:33.985 --> 20:36.569
<i>At first, I thought</i>
<i>it was haunted by Robin,</i>

20:36.571 --> 20:39.439
<i>but now I think</i>
<i>it was haunted by me.</i>

20:39.441 --> 20:44.494
<i>Well, no ghost is at peace</i>
<i>until it finally moves on.</i>

20:45.713 --> 20:47.714
<i>I need a change.</i>

20:47.716 --> 20:49.749
<i>And I think you do, too.</i>

20:49.751 --> 20:52.418
<i>This apartment needs</i>
<i>some new life.</i>

20:52.420 --> 20:56.756
<i>So, please, make our old home</i>
<i>your new home.</i>

20:56.758 --> 20:59.275
<i>It is now ghost-free.</i>

20:59.277 --> 21:00.893
<i>Love, Ted.</i>
