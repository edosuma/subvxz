01:16.120 --> 01:18.031
Margaret, what's in that box?

01:18.280 --> 01:21.397
-ls it food?
-No, Mom.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.712
lt's just some old toys
l'm collecting for charity.

01:24.960 --> 01:29.556
Don't lie to your mother.
l smell garlic chicken.

01:30.640 --> 01:33.518
lt's just Al's socks.

01:35.080 --> 01:36.593
Hey, Peg.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.868
Do l smell garlic chicken?

01:52.600 --> 01:55.512
No, Al. But guess
what l found in the attic.

01:55.760 --> 01:59.833
Hey, if l wanna keep a noose upstairs,
that's my business, Peg.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.354
No, l dug up all these old toys.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.592
They're for Marcie's
toys-for-guns exchange program.

02:08.240 --> 02:12.199
Where do kids today get the idea
that a gun is something to play with?

02:26.880 --> 02:28.154
What is going on here?

02:28.400 --> 02:31.198
This is foreplay.

02:33.320 --> 02:37.472
No, honey, this can't be foreplay.
l'm enjoying it.

02:38.280 --> 02:40.510
And l'm in the room.

02:43.640 --> 02:45.153
l can't believe you guys.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.999
The whole point of this
toys-for-guns exchange program...

02:48.240 --> 02:51.915
...is to give kids something else
to play with besides firearms.

02:52.160 --> 02:57.598
For instance, l'm donating
this oil-covered Alaskan seagull.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.871
Now, watch what happens
when l pull the string.

03:04.840 --> 03:08.230
Kids, don't drink and drive
an oil tanker.

03:10.240 --> 03:13.312
l smell fowl.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.234
You certainly do.

03:22.120 --> 03:26.352
Well, l'm gonna give the
disadvantaged youngsters these dice.

03:26.920 --> 03:29.798
Jefferson, why would you
give a kid dice?

03:30.040 --> 03:32.076
Oh, these aren't just any dice.

03:32.320 --> 03:33.992
They're loaded.

03:34.600 --> 03:38.229
Yup, the lucky gangbanger who
trades in his Uzi for these babies...

03:38.480 --> 03:41.552
...will learn self-esteem
as he fleeces confused retirees...

03:41.800 --> 03:44.155
...out of their social-security checks.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.599
Thank you.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.155
What's Mr. Potato Head doing here?

03:54.400 --> 03:56.356
l don't know. You married him.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.520
Not that Mr. Potato Head.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.513
The one that's actually
worth something.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.956
l'm sorry, Marcie. l myself
once had a Mr. Potato Head...

04:12.200 --> 04:14.350
...who meant a lot to me.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.716
Well, my little sticky buns,
what happened to him?

04:18.200 --> 04:20.077
Well, one night
my frat brothers and l...

04:20.279 --> 04:22.714
...got stinko on Champale
and grenadine.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.148
Next thing l knew...

04:24.360 --> 04:27.830
...l was stuffing Mr. Potato Head's
heinie with cherry bombs.

04:28.920 --> 04:33.550
We lit the fuse and blew
Mr. Potato Head into hash browns.

04:34.560 --> 04:37.597
Oh, we laughed till we puked.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.029
So, Peggy, do you have
any other kids' things?

04:45.280 --> 04:48.431
Well, we have those
child-safety seats in the garage...

04:48.680 --> 04:51.194
...that we never put into the car.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.791
-Why not?
-Well, we found...

04:54.000 --> 04:57.709
...that it was much easier
just to leave the kids at home.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.036
-Let's get them.
-They're out in the garage.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.117
-l'll show you where they are.
-All right.

05:03.320 --> 05:04.912
-Come on, come on.
-Come on, Marcie.

05:14.360 --> 05:19.150
Can you believe that tomorrow
is our five-year high school reunion?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.555
That means we've been
out of school for, like....

05:21.760 --> 05:23.955
For, like, years.

05:24.440 --> 05:27.238
l hear people are coming
from all over for this reunion.

05:27.480 --> 05:30.153
Even foreign countries like lndiana.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.395
lndonesians are coming?

05:33.640 --> 05:36.632
We better brush up on our Spanish.

05:44.520 --> 05:49.116
Hey, Kelly, whatever happened
to your horny newt of a brother, Bud?

05:49.840 --> 05:54.675
l always thought he was cute.
He can realign my molars anytime.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.591
Please.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.388
l heard Bud and his hand
are eloping.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.108
So, Fawn...

06:07.360 --> 06:09.351
...are you still making
your meteoric rise...

06:09.560 --> 06:11.630
...through the hierarchy
of the 7-Eleven?

06:12.960 --> 06:15.713
l'll have you know
that l am a buyer now.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.279
Well, that's a change.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.795
As l recall, back in school
you were a seller.

06:23.920 --> 06:26.912
Hey, Bud, l'm getting my braces off
in a couple years.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.388
Will you wait for me?

06:29.120 --> 06:30.872
Well, sure.
Unless another hot mama...

06:31.080 --> 06:33.958
...with a big, drooly overbite
comes along first.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.357
Where's Ashley?
l thought she'd be here.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.558
Yeah, me too.
Oh, and l've really missed her.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.398
l wrote her all these great letters.

06:44.640 --> 06:47.552
l can't wait until she gets here
so l can give them to her.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.430
Oh, that must be her.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.196
-Ashley!
-Kelly!

07:00.640 --> 07:04.189
Kelly, l have missed you so much,
and l wrote you almost every day.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.668
-Here.
-Oh, cool.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.757
-Here.
-Thanks.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.958
Now that we're all here,
let's all look through my yearbook...

07:13.160 --> 07:15.993
...and trash everybody who isn't us.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.350
Look at that geek.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.389
He would do anything for me.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.995
Do you remember the time
that he loaned me his car...

07:25.200 --> 07:27.589
...and then l went joyriding in it
with another date?

07:27.800 --> 07:30.109
And then we tried to steer it
with our butts...

07:30.360 --> 07:32.715
...and we wrecked it,
and we broke our legs?

07:32.960 --> 07:34.518
He was such an idiot.

07:34.760 --> 07:38.196
-l swear.
-Wait, and then there's this other guy.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.954
l can't remember his name,
but what a dweeb.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.509
Okay. He asked me to the prom,
and l said yes.

07:43.760 --> 07:46.354
So he rented this goony maroon tux
and a stretch limo.

07:46.560 --> 07:49.438
When he showed up to my house
all he found was a note that said:

07:49.640 --> 07:51.949
'' Bite me, nerd boy.''

07:52.960 --> 07:56.157
Oh, l just wish l could remember
who that was.

07:59.760 --> 08:00.988
That would be me.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.751
Oh, yeah. That would be you.

08:07.560 --> 08:08.788
l'm sorry, Bud.

08:09.040 --> 08:12.157
You know, teenage girls
can be so cruel.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.311
l just want you to know l apologize...

08:14.520 --> 08:16.670
...and l hope somehow
l can make it up to you.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.233
Really?

08:22.160 --> 08:23.593
Maybe we can go out sometime.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.193
Bite me, nerd boy.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.355
See what suckers men are?

08:31.680 --> 08:33.875
Sure, go ahead, make fun of me now.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.236
But you'll come back to me
when you're 25...

08:36.440 --> 08:40.149
...and gravity has pulled you apart
like a Stretch Armstrong.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.316
Oh, Bud, don't feel so bad.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.796
There was this guy in high school
who was an even bigger loser than you.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.272
Eric Waters.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.432
Even the tape on his glasses
had acne.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.079
Anyway, he asked me out...

08:54.280 --> 08:56.794
...this one chilly New Year's Eve,
and l said, ''Sure.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.833
Meet me on the top of the Hancock
tower, stripped to the buff.''

09:00.080 --> 09:01.672
Well, of course, l stood him up...

09:01.920 --> 09:04.514
...but that toe they had to amputate
was a good lesson...

09:04.720 --> 09:08.395
...on trying to date out of his league.
What a loser!

09:10.800 --> 09:12.631
We did have a way with guys,
didn't we?

09:12.840 --> 09:15.991
Yep, all we had to do
was give them the move.

09:16.240 --> 09:19.118
l wonder if mine still works.
Let me see.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.111
There's a four-alarm
down at the orphanage...

09:26.320 --> 09:28.356
...but that can wait.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.559
-Wanna ride on my truck?
-Sure.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.199
Bye.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.432
Man, l used to love Monopoly.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.911
Buy a property,
put a bunch of poor people in jail.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.316
Now you wanna build a hotel,
you gotta put up a homeless shelter.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.837
That thimble guy lands
on your property...

09:48.040 --> 09:49.792
...puts up a ''will work for food'' sign.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.752
Ain't a damn thing
you can do about it.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.558
Yeah, they even ruined Operation.

09:54.800 --> 09:57.758
Used to be if you butchered
a guy's spleen, lose a turn.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.877
Now they take away
your medical license...

10:00.080 --> 10:02.548
...and you have to perform
black-market liposuctions...

10:02.760 --> 10:04.557
...in the back of a Jiffy Lube.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.798
Hey, you know. l have a good idea.

10:09.640 --> 10:13.553
Why don't we play Bottoms Up
until the kids come home?

10:13.760 --> 10:16.593
You know what, Peg,
l have an even better idea.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.831
Why don't you and Marcie go hide.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.833
Jefferson and l will come find you.

10:25.520 --> 10:29.991
Good. l love to play hide-and-go-seek.
Come on, Peggy, l know just the place.

10:31.520 --> 10:32.748
One thousand one...

10:32.960 --> 10:34.916
-...one thousand two...
-One thousand two...

10:35.120 --> 10:37.395
-...one thousand three...
-...one thousand three...

10:37.600 --> 10:39.636
-...one thousand four.
-...one thousand four.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.836
Thanks for being
my escort tonight, Bud.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.600
You're welcome. And now that
my escort duties are over...

11:07.800 --> 11:10.360
...l'm going to escort myself
to that redhead over there.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.278
-See you.
-You'll be back.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.950
And you'll be begging me
for a little flesh and metal.

11:25.480 --> 11:28.916
lt feels good to be back
in the old gym again.

11:29.200 --> 11:33.637
Look, the hoops
are in the same place.

11:34.160 --> 11:37.516
Look, there are the bleachers.

11:37.760 --> 11:40.274
And there's the clock.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.070
And there's you.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.589
-Come on. Let's sit down.
-Okay.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.437
Big problem.

11:50.680 --> 11:53.877
There's six chairs and five of us.

11:54.560 --> 11:57.996
Well, maybe one of us
will show up again later.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.239
Oh, gosh.

12:03.480 --> 12:04.959
You guys, this is so much fun.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.476
You know, l think we should have
a five-year reunion every year.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.311
Look at all these losers.

12:11.560 --> 12:15.109
To think that l slept with
every guy in this room.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.188
What was l thinking that night?

12:21.200 --> 12:22.838
Oh, my God.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.873
Hang on to your thigh cream, girls,
prime veal at 4 o'clock.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.758
Where?

12:30.680 --> 12:34.229
No, no, guys. There.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.511
He is cute.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.637
lf l wasn't rocking
Bud's world tonight...

12:39.840 --> 12:42.274
...l'd be wearing him
like a wet retainer.

12:43.720 --> 12:46.393
You guys. You guys.
He's coming this way. Act cool.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.232
He looks important.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.590
Think l can nonchalantly
get my underwear off...

12:51.800 --> 12:53.233
...by the time he gets here?

12:54.960 --> 12:56.837
You're wearing underwear?

12:59.480 --> 13:01.948
You really have changed.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.200
Hi, girls. Remember me?

13:07.960 --> 13:11.475
Aren't you the guy who was standing
over there just a couple minutes ago?

13:13.720 --> 13:17.110
Maybe l can refresh your memory.
Does the Hancock tower ring a bell?

13:17.360 --> 13:20.477
No, but l think there's a time
and temperature sign up there.

13:20.720 --> 13:23.632
Although l can never figure out
which is which.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.875
l can. l watched it go down
to minus 1 0 degrees...

13:27.120 --> 13:30.590
...that New Year's Eve you stood me up.
l'm Eric '' Nine Toes'' Waters.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.590
Eric Waters?

13:35.840 --> 13:37.159
God, you....

13:37.360 --> 13:38.793
You look so different.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.238
lt's amazing how your looks
can improve with nice clothes...

13:42.480 --> 13:45.278
...contact lenses,
and 1 0 million dollars.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.275
Ten million dollars?

13:52.120 --> 13:55.635
Oh, my God, he's the ex-husband
of my dreams.

14:07.120 --> 14:10.829
Look, you guys. Look at all the loser
things Eric used to do in high school.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.676
Computer club.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.433
Future businessman of America.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.797
Look, class valedictator.

14:22.920 --> 14:24.911
Who would've thought
that a geek like that...

14:25.120 --> 14:26.758
...would've ended up successful?

14:27.800 --> 14:30.837
Hey, Kelly, you thinking
what l'm thinking?

14:31.080 --> 14:33.116
Why don't things fall up?

14:34.360 --> 14:35.634
No.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.836
l'm thinking we should
have a contest.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.508
A duel for Eric's affections.

14:40.760 --> 14:41.988
You're on.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.879
-Fine.
-Okay. Chose your weapons.

14:45.120 --> 14:48.157
Damn, l knew l should have brought
my wet T-shirt.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.638
Okay, l'll tell you what we'll do.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.155
-We'll use the move at 40 paces.
-Fine.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.516
-Fine, go ahead.
-Okay.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.355
All right. Move over.

15:15.600 --> 15:19.434
You've seen the rest,
now check out the best.

15:30.160 --> 15:33.357
Wow, he ignored
both of their moves.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.876
Yeah, it's like he's deaf
or something.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.349
This has never happened before.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.068
We need advice
from an expert on rejection.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.709
-Can l have this dance?
-For the 1 5th time:

15:59.600 --> 16:01.795
ls this a cool hickey or what?

16:03.240 --> 16:05.515
lt's much better than
the ones you make at home...

16:05.760 --> 16:07.478
...with the Dustbuster.

16:09.160 --> 16:10.559
Bud...

16:10.800 --> 16:15.555
...with these braces l could make
a hickey that would never heal.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.757
Look, Bud, Kelly and l
can't get anywhere with Eric Waters.

16:20.960 --> 16:23.952
You're somebody who keeps
trying even though he gets rejected...

16:24.160 --> 16:26.833
...you know, time after time
after time after time--

16:27.080 --> 16:29.640
Yeah, l get the point.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.516
Okay. We need to get through to Eric.
What should we do?

16:33.760 --> 16:35.159
Look, before you do anything...

16:35.400 --> 16:38.233
...l'll go talk to him.
l'll see if there's any hope at all.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.833
l'll go with you, Bud.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.640
No. You stay here.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.474
l'd rather admire you
from across the room.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.870
Way, way across the room.

16:50.280 --> 16:55.513
All right. Al, right hand blue.

16:58.560 --> 17:02.348
What is it about this game
that's so sexy?

17:03.600 --> 17:05.750
I'm touching Peg's rear...

17:06.000 --> 17:09.117
...and for once it feels pretty good.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.794
I feel someone touching my rear.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.992
I think it's Al.

17:16.240 --> 17:19.789
He's not as strong as Marcie,
but he knows what I lik e.

17:23.079 --> 17:26.038
I love all these hands
groping my tush.

17:26.280 --> 17:30.558
This game is just lik e sex
except I have a partner.

17:32.160 --> 17:34.037
I hate this game.

17:34.920 --> 17:39.038
No one's touching my rear,
and it's way, way up in the air.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.028
Oh, and they have us neutered.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.639
-Kelly, l need to talk to you for a sec.
-But--

18:10.800 --> 18:13.872
Okay, but just don't touch me.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.357
Look, l talked to Eric,
and he really likes you.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.193
He does?

18:26.840 --> 18:28.159
Oh, my God.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.437
-He wants to meet you alone.
-He does?

18:33.720 --> 18:37.235
Now, he's drawn this map
so you know where to go.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.313
Be there in an hour
and don't tell anyone.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.198
Even you?

18:44.200 --> 18:45.997
Yeah, yeah, especially me.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.037
l can never know.

18:49.440 --> 18:52.477
Oh, thank you so much, Bud.
l owe you bigtime.

18:52.680 --> 18:55.194
l'm not gonna, like, pay you
or anything, but l owe you.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.315
-Ashley, l need to talk to you for a sec.
-Okay.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.437
Just don't touch me.

19:09.520 --> 19:13.195
Look, Eric told me
he really likes you.

19:13.440 --> 19:14.714
He does?

19:18.560 --> 19:21.074
He wants to meet you alone
under the bleachers.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.754
You know, back where they retired
your number.

19:25.360 --> 19:27.237
Thanks, Bud.
And l want you to know...

19:27.480 --> 19:29.710
...out of all the nerd boys
l humiliated...

19:29.920 --> 19:31.990
...you cried the best.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.308
Thanks. l'll remember that.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.269
You just remember,
under the bleachers, 1 5 minutes.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.112
Okay, got it.

19:40.360 --> 19:45.434
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.276
How many Mississippis are there
in 1 5 minutes?

20:02.920 --> 20:05.559
Thanks, Eric.
l had a really good time.

20:05.800 --> 20:08.109
Right back at you.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.956
Nerd girl.

20:25.560 --> 20:27.915
Well, we sure got our revenge.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.995
Well, l certainly got mine.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.197
l still don't know
what yours was, though.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.908
Where did that map lead to
you gave Kelly?

20:40.640 --> 20:45.156
Twenty thousand, two hundred
and thirty Mississippi.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.834
Twenty thousand, two hundred...

20:48.040 --> 20:51.555
...and thirty-one Mississippi.

20:52.320 --> 20:56.632
God, that Bottoms Up was great.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.911
We should do that every night.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.957
Right, Al?

21:08.760 --> 21:10.591
lsn't that typical.

21:10.840 --> 21:14.071
He falls asleep,
and l wanna play again.

21:14.880 --> 21:17.792
Have you seen my Mr. Potato Head?
l can't find him anywhere.

21:18.040 --> 21:20.793
Gee, l think l saw Jefferson
with it a minute ago.

21:32.640 --> 21:34.835
Oh, look up in the sky.

21:35.080 --> 21:38.470
lt's a bird. lt's a plane.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.995
lt's Mr. Potato Head?

21:43.000 --> 21:46.709
l'm starting to get the feeling
that Eric's not gonna show up.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.190
Bud is gonna pay for this.

21:49.440 --> 21:53.274
Oh, it was a mighty fine day
in the life of Bud Bundy.

21:55.880 --> 21:59.589
Well, l guess l'd better find me
a ride home.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.313
-What?
-lt's hickey time.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.232
No. No, no!
