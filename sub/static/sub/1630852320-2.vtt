00:14.292 --> 00:17.959
Person 1:
<i>At this time, I'll ask you</i>
<i>to turn off your cellphones.</i>

00:18.042 --> 00:20.250
<i>All witnesses,
including members of the bar,</i>

00:20.334 --> 00:22.667
<i>will take
an oath of affirmation
or truthfulness.</i>

00:26.500 --> 00:28.876
Person 2:
I just need you both to raise
your right hands, please.

00:28.959 --> 00:30.792
Do you solemnly swear
and affirm the testimony

00:30.876 --> 00:32.375
you give at this hearing
today will be the truth,

00:32.459 --> 00:34.626
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

00:34.709 --> 00:35.792
-I do.
-Mary Pruett: Yes.

00:35.876 --> 00:39.542
Members of the board,
it is our contention

00:39.626 --> 00:44.542
that Mr. Weger's confession
in this case was involuntary,

00:44.626 --> 00:48.834
and was the product of physical
and psychological duress.

00:48.918 --> 00:55.125
At one point, Mr. Weger was kept
awake for a period of 24 hours,

00:55.209 --> 00:59.626
where he was repeatedly
questioned off and on
by his interrogators,

00:59.709 --> 01:00.876
and subjected to lie...

01:00.959 --> 01:02.375
David Raccuglia:
<i>I was incredibly excited</i>

01:02.459 --> 01:06.709
<i>about filming at the clemency
hearing in Chicago.</i>

01:06.792 --> 01:09.000
These are all things
I had never heard.

01:09.083 --> 01:12.751
You gotta realize
I lived in the home
on the prosecution side,

01:12.834 --> 01:14.375
my father's side of the story.

01:14.459 --> 01:18.918
<i>Also, it was the first time
I was going to be able to see</i>

01:19.000 --> 01:21.042
<i>Chester's family.</i>

01:21.125 --> 01:23.375
Mary:
<i>I believe my brother</i>
<i>is innocent.</i>

01:23.459 --> 01:26.459
He could never have done
anything like this to anybody.

01:26.542 --> 01:30.042
Just clear your mind,
and open your hearts.

01:30.125 --> 01:33.167
Things throughout the years
have just been shoved aside.

01:33.250 --> 01:35.542
David:
<i>Chester's sister spoke.</i>

01:35.626 --> 01:38.834
<i>They asked one of the victim's
family to speak.</i>

01:38.918 --> 01:40.209
I'm Diane Oetting,

01:40.292 --> 01:43.626
and I am the firstborn
granddaughter
of Lillian Oetting.

01:43.709 --> 01:46.792
We're the ones that never
had the privilege to meet her

01:46.876 --> 01:49.751
because on March 14th, 1960,

01:49.834 --> 01:52.375
that opportunity
was taken away from us

01:52.459 --> 01:55.209
by the actions of Chester Weger.

01:55.292 --> 01:58.626
George Oetting:
Weger only deserves
to remain quietly

01:58.709 --> 02:00.751
incarcerated
in his Illinois prison

02:00.834 --> 02:02.417
until his final breath.

02:02.500 --> 02:06.167
That was his sentence,
and only then will our families

02:06.250 --> 02:09.542
be able to establish
some sense of personal closure

02:09.626 --> 02:10.709
in this case.

02:10.792 --> 02:12.709
Thank you
for your consideration.

02:12.792 --> 02:15.751
David:
<i>I think my father was last,</i>

02:15.834 --> 02:19.876
and he gave a pretty strong
fire and brimstone kinda speech.

02:19.959 --> 02:22.709
I have a disappointment

02:22.792 --> 02:26.876
that surpasses
all other disappointments
in my professional career

02:26.959 --> 02:30.667
that Chester Weger did not
get the electric chair.

02:30.751 --> 02:35.292
Today Miss Kelly asks you
to give him a reprieve.

02:35.375 --> 02:37.751
He already has his reprieve.

02:37.834 --> 02:42.000
His reprieve is to be
allowed to live,

02:42.083 --> 02:45.667
<i>and keep his soul intact
for 45 years,</i>

02:45.751 --> 02:51.876
<i>waiting to descend in hell,
to burn forever.</i>

02:51.959 --> 02:55.792
Only then will justice prevail.

02:55.876 --> 02:58.417
David:
<i>So, when the hearing was over,</i>
<i>and they were walking out,</i>

02:58.500 --> 03:01.083
<i>we were trying
to get an interview
with Chester's sisters.</i>

03:01.167 --> 03:05.667
I just wish that you
would've told me that you
were Raccuglia's son

03:05.751 --> 03:08.792
because he has lied,
he has did so many lies,

03:08.876 --> 03:12.375
and if I would've known that,
I wouldn't have even
talked to you.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.834
You're biased.
That's all I have to say.

03:14.918 --> 03:18.209
Elveta Milby:
That's right.
You're 100% all the way, sis.

03:18.292 --> 03:20.792
If Raccuglia wants
my brother to go to hell,

03:20.876 --> 03:25.334
there should be a lot more
to go to hell a-along with him.

03:25.417 --> 03:27.000
That's all I can say.

03:27.083 --> 03:31.334
David:
<i>Chester's family did not trust</i>
<i>me in any way, shape, or form.</i>

03:31.417 --> 03:35.584
And I'm sure my father's
passionate comments
didn't help that day.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.167
<i>But I kept trying.</i>

03:40.250 --> 03:43.375
<i>I wanted the truth,
you know, and I was trying
to let her know,</i>

03:43.459 --> 03:47.292
"Look, I know this looks
strange, but, you know,
what do you have to lose?"

03:47.375 --> 03:49.292
Wh-- You know--
What's he gonna go to jail?

03:49.375 --> 03:50.792
Wh-What am I trying to prove?

03:50.876 --> 03:56.375
Why would I make a film
to prove somebody's guilty?

04:53.500 --> 04:55.709
I just thought of him
as extremely guilty

04:55.792 --> 04:58.417
until I started reading
into this a little bit more.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.500
I went to the clemency hearing,
and heard her speak.

05:00.584 --> 05:03.792
I said, "This is it.
I'm gonna go full, full steam
ahead with this thing."

05:10.959 --> 05:13.292

change the whole dynamic</i>

05:13.375 --> 05:17.834
because I was,
for the first time, really gonna
get to listen to another side.

05:17.918 --> 05:22.751
I was appointed
to represent Mr. Weger
in approximately 2001.

05:22.834 --> 05:26.834
In reviewing the transcripts
of the record on appeal,

05:26.918 --> 05:28.667
I had determined

05:28.751 --> 05:30.792
that there were a lot

05:30.876 --> 05:32.834
of troublesome aspects
to the case.

05:32.918 --> 05:34.751
John Drummond:
Obviously, you must've
been convinced that

05:34.834 --> 05:36.417
he might've been innocent.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.250
I, I was convinced of that,

05:38.334 --> 05:40.375
and I am convinced
of that to this day.

05:40.459 --> 05:43.334
<i>Mr. Weger should not
have been even charged</i>

05:43.417 --> 05:46.959
<i>with the offense,
let alone convicted.</i>

05:47.042 --> 05:52.000
There's a whole other side
that really wasn't focused on

05:52.083 --> 05:55.584
<i>by the people who believe
Chester Weger is guilty.</i>

05:55.667 --> 05:57.876
<i>Donna Kelly's clemency petition</i>

05:57.959 --> 06:01.209

Person:
There he is. Hey, Bob.

06:04.417 --> 06:06.375
Bob Petre:
Hi, guys.
What's going on?

06:06.459 --> 06:07.876
Person:
Ah, we just wanted to stop by,

06:07.959 --> 06:09.876
and take a look
at some of that stuff,

06:09.959 --> 06:13.834
uh, you guys have put together.

06:13.918 --> 06:16.083
Bob:
<i>I went over to Donna's office,</i>

06:16.167 --> 06:19.626
and she said, "Well, what's
your interest in this case?"

06:19.709 --> 06:23.125
And I said,
"Well, he's innocent."

06:23.209 --> 06:26.626
<i>She says, "Can you prove it?"
And I said, "Yes."</i>

06:26.709 --> 06:29.250
Been working on this
Chester Weger case

06:29.334 --> 06:31.000
for some 24 years now,

06:31.083 --> 06:34.250
and I'm convinced
in my mind that he's innocent.

06:34.334 --> 06:37.167
One of the things
that bothered me through,

06:37.250 --> 06:38.417
through everything was,

06:38.500 --> 06:42.709
was, how many people
were involved, you know?

06:42.792 --> 06:44.876
They had two different
hair samples,

06:44.959 --> 06:48.250
<i>so they knew that there
were at least two killers.</i>

06:48.334 --> 06:50.000
<i>That was big for me.</i>

06:50.083 --> 06:53.083
Let's see what else--
if there's anything else
on this board.

06:53.167 --> 06:59.167
Oh, robbery was the motive
in this case and nothing--

06:59.250 --> 07:02.042
It always bothered me
that nothing was robbed.

07:02.125 --> 07:05.500
Th-the wedding rings were there,
the jewelry was there.

07:05.584 --> 07:08.626
Nothing was taken
from the women.

07:08.709 --> 07:10.667
Steve Stout:
<i>I'm just amazed at the people</i>

07:10.751 --> 07:12.918
<i>who stand out there,
and scream on
the street corners</i>

07:13.000 --> 07:15.334
<i>that Chester Weger's innocent,
but never talked to me.</i>

07:15.417 --> 07:17.334
The people who are interested
in learning everything

07:17.417 --> 07:20.334
about the Starved Rock murders,
they have that information
in one place.

07:20.417 --> 07:24.584
<i>I've had people read the book,
and say, "I believe that
he didn't do it."</i>

07:24.667 --> 07:26.751
I go, "Which book did you read?"

07:26.834 --> 07:31.125
When I read that book,
I, I thought Chester,
probably, did it,

07:31.209 --> 07:33.125
but he didn't do it alone.

07:33.209 --> 07:34.792
The next time I read the book,

07:34.876 --> 07:37.751
I, I paid a little more
attention to detail.

07:37.834 --> 07:40.918
<i>The people that Steve
was thanking</i>

07:41.000 --> 07:43.083
<i>for the information
for the book</i>

07:43.167 --> 07:46.626
<i>were the people that helped
Chester be put away.</i>

07:46.709 --> 07:48.334
Just didn't seem fair
and balanced.

07:48.417 --> 07:51.626
What is Chester's motive?
Theft?

07:51.709 --> 07:53.709
I mean, it's,
it's just ridiculous.

07:53.792 --> 07:57.209
<i>I was in the Committee to Free
Chester Weger with Bob.</i>

07:57.292 --> 07:59.417
We put a lot of time into this.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.918
A lot of time.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.292
Dave Marsh,
Bob Petre and Deedra Fox.

08:04.375 --> 08:06.834
We were gonna solve the case
best we could,

08:06.918 --> 08:09.167
<i>or at least bring it back
into people's attention.</i>

08:09.250 --> 08:12.500
<i>In my professional opinion,
having a degree</i>

08:12.584 --> 08:14.417
in criminal justice

08:14.500 --> 08:16.250
and forensic science,

08:16.334 --> 08:18.334
there is no way

08:18.417 --> 08:21.209
that Chester Weger
is guilty.

08:21.292 --> 08:24.584
David:
<i>I really got to listen,</i>
<i>for the first time,</i>

08:24.667 --> 08:26.042
<i>to the other side,</i>

08:26.125 --> 08:30.209
and I have to tell you,
it wasn't all innuendo.

08:30.292 --> 08:32.834
There was things that I learned,

08:32.918 --> 08:35.500
that I researched,
that I was shocked.

08:35.584 --> 08:37.083
I talked to some jurors.

08:37.167 --> 08:38.792
I, I talked to Nancy Porter.

08:38.876 --> 08:41.209
<i>That was eye-opening
stuff, too.</i>

08:41.292 --> 08:43.083
<i>And I asked her, I said,</i>

08:43.167 --> 08:46.792
<i>"There's no way one person
could've killed
those three women."</i>

08:46.876 --> 08:48.167
That much I know,"
and she said,

08:48.250 --> 08:50.500
"Yeah, the jury knew that too."

08:50.584 --> 08:53.751
When's all this
gonna come about now?

08:53.834 --> 08:56.375
-David:
Oh, it takes a long time.
-Oh, I'm sure it does.

08:56.459 --> 09:01.834
Nancy Porter:
<i>I don't think any of us</i>
<i>were 100% sure.</i>

09:01.918 --> 09:03.751
The nagging doubt was because

09:03.834 --> 09:06.709
the reason he--
we said he was guilty

09:06.792 --> 09:09.417
was because he signed
a confession.

09:09.500 --> 09:13.792
As far as we were concerned
there was no...

09:13.876 --> 09:17.209
nothing to prove
that he did it besides that.

09:17.292 --> 09:20.334
Bob:
<i>She was not convinced</i>
<i>that Chester did it.</i>

09:20.417 --> 09:24.626
That's why she was opposed,
from the beginning,
to the death penalty.

09:24.709 --> 09:29.083
With the life sentence,
if anything ever happened

09:29.167 --> 09:32.417
that would prove that somebody
else did it, he had a chance.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.417
If we put him to death,

09:34.500 --> 09:37.792
and somebody came forward,
he was gone.

09:37.876 --> 09:40.584
Bob:
<i>She said, "If he did it."</i>

09:40.667 --> 09:42.792
<i>She kept saying,
"If he did it."</i>

09:42.876 --> 09:45.250
<i>And I said,
"Well, wait a minute.
What do you mean?"</i>

09:45.334 --> 09:47.334
<i>You were on the jury."</i>

09:47.417 --> 09:49.500
And she said, "All I can say is,

09:49.584 --> 09:52.667
"if they held that
same trial today

09:52.751 --> 09:54.584
"with the evidence
that they had,

09:54.667 --> 09:58.334
Chester Weger
would be a free man."

09:58.417 --> 10:01.918
Nancy:
<i>At the time,</i>
<i>we believed in the officers,</i>

10:02.000 --> 10:04.250
but after we got out,

10:04.334 --> 10:05.834
I think there are 12 people

10:05.918 --> 10:09.042
that had doubts
about their testimonies.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.042
(David speaking)

10:11.125 --> 10:13.000
Uh...

10:14.876 --> 10:17.626
I'd never heard
of the-- those two officers

10:17.709 --> 10:19.209
before the trial.

10:19.292 --> 10:20.584
But, man, afterwards,

10:20.667 --> 10:22.751
we heard plenty about them.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.876
Bob:
<i>The people responsible</i>
<i>for setting him up</i>

10:27.959 --> 10:31.334
<i>was Billy Dummett
and Wayne Hess.</i>

10:31.417 --> 10:34.000
They were gonna get somebody.

10:35.834 --> 10:38.125
Dan Churney:
<i>People who think</i>
<i>Weger is innocent,</i>

10:38.209 --> 10:40.334
<i>I can understand
where they're coming from.</i>

10:40.417 --> 10:44.918
My brother was a deputy sheriff
in this county for 25 years,

10:45.000 --> 10:46.876
and he worked with Dummett,
and he told me,

10:46.959 --> 10:48.834
this is exact quote,
he said,

10:48.918 --> 10:51.250
"Dummett was as crooked
as the day was long."

10:51.334 --> 10:56.125
<i>I think that fuels this theory
that Weger was framed.</i>

10:56.209 --> 10:58.500
Deedra Fox:
<i>It was political.</i>

10:58.584 --> 11:00.667
That was an election year.

11:00.751 --> 11:02.542
The people of LaSalle County,

11:02.626 --> 11:04.876
they had to have it solved.

11:04.959 --> 11:08.042
David:
<i>Harland Warren</i>
<i>was never gonna leave office</i>

11:08.125 --> 11:10.209
<i>without getting
that case solved.</i>

11:10.292 --> 11:11.751
<i>After he lost the election,</i>

11:11.834 --> 11:15.042
<i>he would have to leave office
on December 1st,</i>

11:15.125 --> 11:17.918
<i>so making the arrest
on November 16th</i>

11:18.000 --> 11:21.042
<i>still made him
the man who solved
the Starved Rock murders,</i>

11:21.125 --> 11:22.834
whether he was
state's attorney or not.

11:24.500 --> 11:27.000
Karen Norris:
<i>I mean, we all know</i>
<i>how elections go.</i>

11:27.083 --> 11:30.751
<i>I have heard some things
about the pressure</i>

11:30.834 --> 11:33.918
that he was under
if he didn't get a conviction.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.959
I think my grandpa
just wanted it done.

11:37.042 --> 11:39.292
(indistinct chatter)

11:40.792 --> 11:42.417
Harland Warren:
This cake is
nonfattening, girls.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.792
Woman:
Is that what it is?
Okay, well, that's good.

11:44.876 --> 11:47.375
-It better not be because
this is a going out party.
-Woman: It's delicious.

11:47.459 --> 11:48.834
You gotta have something good.

11:48.918 --> 11:51.250
Karen:
<i>People looked up</i>
<i>to my grandfather as someone</i>

11:51.334 --> 11:54.375
<i>that literally shut down
a heinous, you know, murderer</i>

11:54.459 --> 11:57.459
<i>and stopped him in his tracks,
so that it couldn't
happen again.</i>

11:57.542 --> 11:59.626
<i>He protected the town,
he protected the park.</i>

11:59.709 --> 12:01.584
Anne Warren Smith:
Would you guys like
something to drink?

12:01.667 --> 12:03.375
Karen:
<i>My mom, she was</i>
<i>right there with him.</i>

12:03.459 --> 12:05.209
<i>Answering phones,
doing errands for him.</i>

12:05.292 --> 12:09.334
She was pretty much by his side
up until the day he died.

12:10.792 --> 12:12.584
<i>He passed in 2006.</i>

12:12.667 --> 12:15.709
<i>His office was still full
of everything,</i>

12:15.792 --> 12:18.292
<i>um, people's files,
files from the case.</i>

12:18.375 --> 12:20.250
<i>So, he did have a lot
of personal notes</i>

12:20.334 --> 12:25.083
that he was trying to just
suss out what the hell happened.

12:25.167 --> 12:29.000
Dave Marsh:
<i>Harland Warren's daughter,</i>
<i>basically, called me and said,</i>

12:29.083 --> 12:31.459
<i>"Dave, I found this note.
It's scribbly.</i>

12:31.542 --> 12:33.834
<i>I don't know what it is.
I think it's important."</i>

12:33.918 --> 12:37.083
What it was
was Harland Warren...

12:39.500 --> 12:41.626
got hammered one night,

12:41.709 --> 12:45.042
and drew up the plan
to frame Chester Weger.

12:46.876 --> 12:48.375
<i>It starts out with query.</i>

12:48.459 --> 12:51.792
<i>"How do you prove Weger
was in the canyon?"</i>

12:51.876 --> 12:55.083
<i>"Demand he confess.
Persuade him."</i>

12:55.167 --> 12:57.918
<i>"Commence
psychological warfare."</i>

12:58.000 --> 13:00.542
Karen:
<i>You guys know what</i>
<i>psychological warfare is?</i>

13:00.626 --> 13:02.292
It's where you break
someone down.

13:02.375 --> 13:06.000
It's where you put enough
pressure on someone,

13:06.083 --> 13:09.584
either physically, mentally,
or emotionally,

13:09.667 --> 13:13.375
that they, literally,
have no choice but to give
into your demands.

13:15.209 --> 13:17.250
<i>It kinda made me sick
to my stomach</i>

13:17.334 --> 13:20.542
<i>because that, literally,
meant that...</i>

13:20.626 --> 13:24.542
there wasn't enough evidence.

13:24.626 --> 13:27.709
(fanfare plays)

13:27.792 --> 13:30.792
I have been confronted
with a subject

13:30.876 --> 13:34.125
who is stubbornly replying
to interrogation with lies.

13:34.209 --> 13:37.125
<i>This was clearly a place
where the polygraph could help.</i>

13:37.209 --> 13:38.834
<i>Remember, the polygraph</i>

13:38.918 --> 13:42.167
<i>is no substitute
for a thorough investigation.</i>

13:42.250 --> 13:45.292
David:
<i>Chester Weger became</i>
<i>the main suspect</i>

13:45.375 --> 13:47.375
<i>in the Starved Rock murders</i>

13:47.459 --> 13:51.167
<i>because the operator
of the lie detector machine</i>

13:51.250 --> 13:54.417
<i>was convinced this was the man.</i>

13:54.500 --> 13:58.375
Harland decided, "We gotta get
a confession out of this guy."

13:58.459 --> 13:59.751
They were after him,

13:59.834 --> 14:04.167
and they were going to go balls
to the walls to get this done.

14:04.250 --> 14:08.417
Above all, the examiner
must scrupulously avoid

14:08.500 --> 14:11.751
using the polygraph
as a psychological prop.

14:11.834 --> 14:12.876
David:
<i>They asked him</i>

14:12.959 --> 14:13.918
<i>and Stanley Tucker,</i>

14:14.000 --> 14:15.083
<i>Chester's friend, and also</i>

14:15.167 --> 14:16.417
<i>another employee of the lodge,</i>

14:16.500 --> 14:20.959
<i>to go to Chicago
to take another test.</i>

14:21.042 --> 14:23.709
<i>Chester agreed.
Chester always agreed.</i>

14:23.792 --> 14:26.042
Chester Weger:
<i>I had no brother,</i>
<i>and Stanley Tucker</i>

14:26.125 --> 14:27.918
<i>was like a brother to me.</i>

14:28.000 --> 14:30.584
<i>The police lied to him
and me so much.</i>

14:30.667 --> 14:32.459
They'd tell me,
"Stanley confessed,

14:32.542 --> 14:34.042
and you might
as well come clean."

14:34.125 --> 14:36.500
And they'd tell Stanley
the same thing about me,

14:36.584 --> 14:39.918
<i>tried to get Tucker to confess,
and it wasn't true.</i>

14:40.000 --> 14:42.876
Person:
<i>Do you intend to answer,</i>
<i>truthfully, each question?</i>

14:42.959 --> 14:44.125
Yes.

14:44.209 --> 14:45.375
Chester:
<i>I told 'em, I said,</i>

14:45.459 --> 14:46.834
<i>"You get me an attorney,
I'll take the test."</i>

14:46.918 --> 14:48.584
<i>I said, "Otherwise,
I'm not taking it."</i>

14:48.667 --> 14:51.709
I'm already
hooked up to the machine,
he started asking me questions,

14:51.792 --> 14:55.292
so I just started moving around
to mess up the test.

14:55.375 --> 14:59.167
David:
<i>According to Chester's account,</i>
<i>it made him very uncomfortable.</i>

14:59.250 --> 15:05.083
<i>He started flexing his muscles,
he started doing things that
they'd consider suspicious.</i>

15:05.167 --> 15:08.584
<i>They put Chester back
in the car.</i>

15:08.667 --> 15:12.209
<i>Bill Dummett,
the deputy sheriff,
wasn't very happy,</i>

15:12.292 --> 15:16.751
<i>and he turned around
to Chester in his, you know,
sort of, cowboy way,</i>

15:16.834 --> 15:20.459
<i>and said, "Chester, you're
gonna ride a thunderbolt.</i>

15:20.542 --> 15:22.751
You're gonna ride
a thunderbolt."

15:22.834 --> 15:25.209
And I knew what
he was talking about

15:25.292 --> 15:27.209
because he threatened me
with the electric chair before,

15:27.292 --> 15:31.375
and I told him, "I ain't going
to get the electric chair.
I ain't done nothing wrong."

15:31.459 --> 15:35.500
(Chester speaking)

15:35.584 --> 15:38.918
Donna Kelly:
<i>During the trial,</i>
<i>Deputy Dummett swore under oath</i>

15:39.000 --> 15:42.459
that he never threatened
Chester Weger that he would
ride a thunderbolt.

15:42.542 --> 15:46.500
And the defense called
as a witness, Craig Armstrong,

15:46.584 --> 15:47.751
<i>who was in the vehicle,</i>

15:47.834 --> 15:50.250
<i>and the assistant
state's attorney testified</i>

15:50.334 --> 15:52.959
<i>that Deputy Dummett indeed
threatened Chester Weger</i>

15:53.042 --> 15:58.125
<i>that he would ride
a thunderbolt at least
five times during that trip.</i>

15:58.209 --> 16:02.876
Deputy Dummett was a perjurer.
He lied. He lied under oath.

16:02.959 --> 16:05.375
<i>Chester Weger's
entire conviction is based</i>

16:05.459 --> 16:07.459
<i>on that man's word.</i>

16:07.542 --> 16:10.083
<i>That evening, he was brought</i>

16:10.167 --> 16:12.167
<i>to the LaSalle County
Courthouse,</i>

16:12.250 --> 16:16.042
<i>and despite being kept up
for 24 hours,</i>

16:16.125 --> 16:18.417
<i>interrogated continuously,</i>

16:18.500 --> 16:21.292
<i>he still maintained
he was innocent.</i>

16:22.876 --> 16:26.667
Then, the Illinois State Police
began trailing Chester.

16:26.751 --> 16:29.375
They had a 24-hour
surveillance on him.

16:29.459 --> 16:31.667
Chester:
<i>I was being followed</i>
<i>everywhere I went.</i>

16:31.751 --> 16:33.751
<i>The police knew
what was happening.</i>

16:39.500 --> 16:42.042
<i>It's not too long
before I got arrested.</i>

16:42.918 --> 16:45.375
(Harland speaking)

16:51.792 --> 16:53.834
David:
<i>The night of the confession,</i>

16:53.918 --> 16:57.751
<i>Chester Weger was
brought in at five o'clock.</i>

16:57.834 --> 17:01.626
<i>36 hours later,
he had confessed to murder,</i>

17:01.709 --> 17:06.876
to rape, to robbery,
to multiple people.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.125
David:
<i>James Supan,</i>

17:24.209 --> 17:26.792
<i>who was the boyfriend
of the rape victim,</i>

17:26.876 --> 17:29.584
<i>was brought in to identify him.</i>

17:29.667 --> 17:31.375
(Chester speaking)

17:39.375 --> 17:41.584
One of the victims
did pick him out of a lineup,

17:41.667 --> 17:44.626
but I have never been able
to get access to that lineup

17:44.709 --> 17:47.751
until recently,
and the lineup is a joke.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.542
<i>Chester Weger was 21 years old.</i>

17:50.626 --> 17:53.292
<i>The Sheriff's Department
from LaSalle County</i>

17:53.375 --> 17:56.167
<i>put him in a lineup
with four or five gentlemen</i>

17:56.250 --> 17:58.918
<i>who are not under
the age of 45.</i>

17:59.000 --> 18:02.918
<i>A couple of them
are elderly men.</i>

18:03.000 --> 18:06.250
I mean, call it a lineup.
It looks more like
a clown show to me.

18:06.334 --> 18:09.375
<i>They wanted to sully
his reputation,</i>

18:09.459 --> 18:12.334
<i>make him look like
habitual criminal.</i>

18:12.417 --> 18:15.292
This was completely
constructed out of thin air

18:15.375 --> 18:17.834
by, uh, Dummett and Hess.

18:19.667 --> 18:21.626
Chester:
On the night
that I was arrested,

18:21.709 --> 18:24.375
Bill Dummett and Wayne Hess
already had a confession,

18:24.459 --> 18:27.709
<i>and they read it,
probably, 10, 15 times.</i>

18:27.792 --> 18:30.626
They were saying,
"You know you done this.
You know you done it."

18:30.709 --> 18:33.459
I said, "I, I never
com-committed the murder."

18:33.542 --> 18:36.250
Dave:
<i>The way the whole thing</i>
<i>went down just stinks.</i>

18:36.334 --> 18:38.459
Interrogating somebody
at two o'clock in the morning?

18:38.542 --> 18:41.918
Nothing good or honest happens
at two o'clock in the morning,

18:42.000 --> 18:45.167
unless it's between you
and your wife.

18:45.250 --> 18:50.375
Chester:
<i>Bill Dummett started</i>
<i>messing around.</i>

18:50.459 --> 18:52.167
<i>He was sitting behind me,</i>

18:52.250 --> 18:55.125
and he kept putting
a gun behind my head,

18:55.209 --> 18:56.876
and pulling the trigger,
and stuff like that.

18:56.959 --> 19:01.042
I turned like that,
and, and the pistol
went in my mouth.

19:01.125 --> 19:05.334
<i>He just kept on all night,
and he hit me in the groin,</i>

19:05.417 --> 19:07.209
and, he said,
"Oh, that hurt there,
didn't it?"

19:07.292 --> 19:10.250
I said, "Yeah, it hurt,"
you know, and...

19:10.334 --> 19:13.083
he, he just kept
hitting me, and--

19:22.918 --> 19:25.876
Anthony Raccuglia:
<i>Do I think that Dummett,</i>
<i>uh, did everything he could</i>

19:25.959 --> 19:30.417
psychologically to coerce
Chester Weger into
giving a statement?

19:30.500 --> 19:31.667
Yes.

19:31.751 --> 19:35.626
Do I think he physically
abused Chester Weger?
No.

19:35.709 --> 19:38.667
Do I think we could've
convicted Chester Weger today?

19:38.751 --> 19:40.417
Absolutely not.

19:40.500 --> 19:43.334
I don't think the confessions
would've made it,

19:43.417 --> 19:44.584
but the times were different.

19:44.667 --> 19:48.250
See, you can't judge
Chester Weger's investigation,

19:48.334 --> 19:51.959
and whether the confessions
were voluntary or involuntary

19:52.042 --> 19:54.125
on 2000s law.

19:54.209 --> 19:56.167
You have to go back in time.

19:56.250 --> 19:58.375
That's what's
so hard for you guys.

19:58.459 --> 20:00.500
Guys your age
that weren't even born.

20:00.584 --> 20:06.334
Back then, a confession
didn't have to be voluntary.
It only had to be truthful.

20:06.417 --> 20:08.375
And I think that's
what happened in this case.

20:08.459 --> 20:10.918
-I don't think he
wanted to admit--
-Okay.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.083
David:
<i>Blind faith.</i>

20:14.167 --> 20:16.584
<i>My father had blind faith
in the law.</i>

20:16.667 --> 20:20.375
As long as it went all the way
to the Supreme Court,
and it was upheld,

20:20.459 --> 20:22.918
and it was all done
with legal merit,

20:23.000 --> 20:27.584
there's no way Chester Weger
could be innocent of this crime.

20:27.667 --> 20:30.292
Reporter:
<i>This morning, Weger accompanied</i>
<i>police to the murder scene,</i>

20:30.375 --> 20:32.417
<i>and reenacted
the crime for them.</i>

20:32.500 --> 20:36.292
Now I submit to this board
that anyone who reads

20:36.375 --> 20:38.375
the substance
of these confessions

20:38.459 --> 20:41.292
would know that these accounts
are fictional.

20:41.375 --> 20:45.459
Chester:
<i>I was told what to say down</i>
<i>there, and they coached me.</i>

20:45.542 --> 20:50.083
I figured, you know, people
are goin' to see this and, and
know that they're telling me.

20:50.167 --> 20:53.250
Donna:
<i>He told the police,</i>
<i>"Well, my motive was robbery."</i>

20:53.334 --> 20:55.584
Reporter:
<i>He says he tried to grab</i>
<i>the purse of one woman,</i>

20:55.667 --> 20:56.709
<i>and found it was a camera.</i>

20:56.792 --> 20:59.751
How does an unarmed man
of 5'8" height

20:59.834 --> 21:02.667
convince three women
to go down into a canyon,

21:02.751 --> 21:05.959
<i>and agree to be tied up
when the man is unarmed?</i>

21:06.042 --> 21:08.792
Reporter:
<i>The three women were cowed</i>
<i>into letting him tie them up.</i>

21:08.876 --> 21:12.751
<i>But he then begged the three
women to give him a chance
to get away, which they did.</i>

21:12.834 --> 21:16.167
Donna:
<i>And then, only after</i>
<i>Mr. Weger was leaving</i>

21:16.250 --> 21:19.125
does one decide
to break free of her string,

21:19.209 --> 21:20.792
<i>and go and attack him.</i>

21:20.876 --> 21:23.584
Reporter:
<i>He then picked up a broken limb</i>
<i>of a tree and clubbed her,</i>

21:23.667 --> 21:26.125
<i>but he was afraid the other
two women would get away,</i>

21:26.209 --> 21:28.042
<i>so he clubbed them
to death, too.</i>

21:28.125 --> 21:29.959
Donna:
<i>The confessions</i>
<i>don't even match</i>

21:30.042 --> 21:31.792
<i>some of the physical evidence
in the case.</i>

21:31.876 --> 21:35.334
These women died with three
instrumentalities of death.

21:35.417 --> 21:38.209
<i>It's implausible that you're
gonna have a single individual</i>

21:38.292 --> 21:41.876
<i>killing one woman
with the camera, hitting
the other one with a log,</i>

21:41.959 --> 21:45.584
and then, killing a third one
with a set of binoculars.
It just doesn't make any sense.

21:45.667 --> 21:47.083
It seems as though
there was a struggle,

21:47.167 --> 21:49.375
and there were
multiple individuals involved.

21:50.125 --> 21:52.500
(Reporter speaking)

21:54.876 --> 21:56.626
(Reporter speaking)

22:00.167 --> 22:03.334
If the motive was robbery,
how come nothing here was taken?

22:03.417 --> 22:05.626
There were--
The women had their watches,
they had their rings.

22:05.709 --> 22:08.834
These confessions
are implausible,
they don't make any sense,

22:08.918 --> 22:12.959
and yet, this is the evidence
which was used
to convict this man.

22:13.042 --> 22:17.751
-David:<i> This is such</i>
<i>a bizarre crime, Dad.</i>
-Anthony:<i> I agree.</i>

22:17.834 --> 22:21.667
David:
<i>You know, beating three women's</i>
<i>heads off is not a standard--</i>

22:21.751 --> 22:23.584
-I agree.
-Rage doesn't even do that.

22:23.667 --> 22:27.250
-Well, rage does, but--
-And then, let, let me
ask you this, though.

22:27.334 --> 22:30.918
Then it said he staged them
to look like a rape

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
with their underpants torn off.

22:33.083 --> 22:36.918
I mean, it just gets--
It, it gets even harder
to understand.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.918
But we know why
he dragged them, uh, under
the, uh, cave, uh, edifice

22:42.000 --> 22:44.417
is because he saw
that red airplane.

22:44.500 --> 22:47.542
<i>And that could not have been
known by anyone</i>

22:47.626 --> 22:51.876
<i>other than the person who was
there at the time of the crime.</i>

22:53.751 --> 22:56.209
John:
<i>From the confession, he went</i>
<i>to a great amount of detail</i>

22:56.292 --> 22:58.125
<i>that only the killer,
you think, would know.</i>

22:58.209 --> 23:01.083
But the problem with that
is that Bill Dummett

23:01.167 --> 23:03.459
was a member
of the Ottawa Airman's Club.

23:03.542 --> 23:07.667
<i>He, in fact, may have even
flown that plane before.</i>

23:07.751 --> 23:10.959
<i>And we did have an affidavit
from Homer Charbonneau,</i>

23:11.042 --> 23:13.792
<i>who was the pilot
of that plane.</i>

23:13.876 --> 23:16.792
Person:
Did you see Bill Dummett
a lot at the club?

23:16.876 --> 23:19.417
-This was the--
-Oh, frequently, yeah.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.375
Frequently, I saw him.

23:21.459 --> 23:25.334
Bill Dummett could have known
prior to the confession

23:25.417 --> 23:29.125
that that plane had been flown
on that particular day.

23:29.209 --> 23:34.626
It was instrumental in
getting him convicted, I think,

23:34.709 --> 23:37.167
and, uh, it bothers me.

23:37.250 --> 23:40.667
The police already knew about
the plane before I was arrested.

23:40.751 --> 23:43.000
(Person speaking)

23:43.083 --> 23:47.167
Yeah.
"Big point, why pull bodies
underneath the cliff?"

23:47.250 --> 23:50.000
"The plane was flying around,
checked Ottawa Airport."

23:50.083 --> 23:52.167
<i>"Wayne said deputy made it up."</i>

23:52.250 --> 23:54.417
<i>Okay, that would be Wayne Hess.</i>

23:54.500 --> 23:56.417
<i>If he said
the deputy made it up,</i>

23:56.500 --> 23:59.125
that's because Dummett and Hess,
they were in on it.

23:59.209 --> 24:00.876
Man.

24:00.959 --> 24:04.167
I mean, I've heard some
professional liars in my day.

24:05.417 --> 24:07.125
Donna:
<i>The entire case rests</i>

24:07.209 --> 24:09.083
<i>on the credibility
of Bill Dummett,</i>

24:09.167 --> 24:12.125
an individual
who was a perjurer.

24:12.209 --> 24:13.417
He was a liar.

24:13.500 --> 24:17.292
<i>Bill Dummett took
one of the murder weapons,</i>

24:17.375 --> 24:18.626
<i>the log which was used</i>

24:18.709 --> 24:21.500
<i>to bludgeon
three women to death,</i>

24:21.584 --> 24:25.375
<i>and put it on his mantelpiece
as a trophy.</i>

24:25.459 --> 24:28.959
This only one example
of how the evidence
was handled in this case.

24:30.292 --> 24:32.292
David:
<i>They call him</i>
<i>"Dustpan Dummett."</i>

24:32.375 --> 24:34.876
He would always clean
something up for the state.

24:34.959 --> 24:36.959
He, he was the guy
they would bring in,

24:37.042 --> 24:39.125
and, all of a sudden,
a fact would appear.

24:39.209 --> 24:40.876
You know,
according to Chester,

24:40.959 --> 24:44.042
Dummett is the man who
fabricated, and wrote
the confession.

24:44.125 --> 24:46.834
Dummett, yes.
I'd say that Dummett had a,

24:46.918 --> 24:50.834
had a questionable reputation
in, in terms of investigations.

24:50.918 --> 24:53.042
He would take over
an investigation,

24:53.125 --> 24:59.417
and would, uh, not share
the, the, uh, information
until the last minute,

24:59.500 --> 25:03.167
which was, uh, suspicious.

<i>Ken in South Ottawa.</i>

25:06.542 --> 25:08.792
<i>Ken, I know you're old enough
to remember when this happened,</i>

25:08.876 --> 25:10.709
<i>and you, probably,
knew Harland Warren, right?</i>

25:10.792 --> 25:13.584
Ken (on phone):
<i>Knew both Harland Warren</i>
<i>and Tony Raccuglia,</i>

25:13.667 --> 25:17.417
<i>and both gentlemen were--
had integrity beyond reproach.</i>

25:17.500 --> 25:19.000
Radio Host:
<i>I agree.</i>
<i>I would never question</i>

25:19.083 --> 25:20.751
<i>the integrity of the people
trying this case.</i>

25:20.834 --> 25:23.250
<i>And it's in Steve Stout's book,</i>
The Starved Rock Murders.

25:23.334 --> 25:26.042
<i>I mean, so that's pretty
convincing, I think,</i>

25:26.125 --> 25:27.876
<i>just the transcript
from the trial.</i>

25:27.959 --> 25:29.792
Steve:
<i>You could imagine the horror</i>

25:29.876 --> 25:31.709
<i>of finding three tourists</i>

25:31.792 --> 25:34.500
dead at a state park.

25:34.584 --> 25:36.792
It really was the OJ case
of its day,

25:36.876 --> 25:40.417
and now, people think that
Mr. Warren, the detectives,

25:40.500 --> 25:43.167
Tony Raccuglia were wrong.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.918
They sent an innocent man
to jail.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.751
You don't know these men
if you think that.

25:48.834 --> 25:50.834
Mr. Warren,
why don't you come up?

25:50.918 --> 25:52.584
-Person: Harland,
he's talking to you.
-What?

25:52.667 --> 25:53.876
Steve:
Come on up.

25:53.959 --> 25:55.334
-Steve: Yeah, you!
-Me.

25:55.417 --> 25:57.334
Steve:
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the hero of the county.

25:58.959 --> 26:00.459
Steve:
No.

26:00.542 --> 26:03.125
-Thank you for coming tonight.
Thank you very much.
-Glad to do it.

26:03.209 --> 26:07.334
I think the real question,
Mr. Warren, would you ever send
an innocent man to jail?

26:07.417 --> 26:08.792
No.

26:08.876 --> 26:13.375
-It's that simple.
It's that simple.
-Well, I couldn't man--

26:13.459 --> 26:16.042
Tell me,
could I manufacture that?

26:16.125 --> 26:18.542
The airplane story?
How 'bout you?

26:18.626 --> 26:19.751
Huh? No?

26:19.834 --> 26:22.876
David:
<i>Harland Warren</i>
<i>is a real enigma to me.</i>

26:22.959 --> 26:25.250
<i>Highly celebrated.</i>

26:25.334 --> 26:28.500
He wanted to make a statement,
and he didn't want rebuttal.

26:28.584 --> 26:31.876
Shake the hand
of a hero right here.
Thank you so much.

26:31.959 --> 26:35.459
Dan:
<i>Another thing that kinda</i>
<i>is unfathomable now,</i>

26:35.542 --> 26:40.000
Harland Warren and, uh, two
sheriff's office investigators,

26:40.083 --> 26:42.334
uh, all shared the reward money

26:42.417 --> 26:45.667
<i>for solving the crime,
which, you know,</i>

26:45.751 --> 26:49.083
that's unbelievable that
that was how it went down.

26:49.167 --> 26:52.792
David:
<i>Harland Warren said he would</i>
<i>never take the money.</i>

26:52.876 --> 26:54.334
I thought that was his job,

26:54.417 --> 26:57.083
but he ultimately
got the lion's share.

26:57.167 --> 26:58.667
Anthony:
<i>I didn't approve of that.</i>

26:58.751 --> 27:01.292
I don't know why he did it.
He certainly didn't
need the money.

27:01.375 --> 27:04.042
Harland was upset that
more didn't go to his camp.

27:04.125 --> 27:05.334
Well, what does that
tell you?

27:05.417 --> 27:09.375
Doesn't that tell you
that his ego was involved?

27:09.459 --> 27:12.209
He was upset because
he didn't get the credit.

27:12.292 --> 27:14.000
Thank you for coming
tonight.

27:16.167 --> 27:20.959
David:
<i>I found Harland Warren's</i>
<i>character interesting.</i>

27:21.042 --> 27:24.876
<i>A very strange little dynamic
in this community of reward,</i>

27:24.959 --> 27:29.083
<i>and who was the hero,
and who was in it
for the money?</i>

27:29.167 --> 27:32.375
Dan:
<i>I think people feel</i>
<i>you can't trust the system.</i>

27:32.459 --> 27:36.626
<i>The system will always
screw the little guy.</i>

27:36.709 --> 27:39.459
<i>People who believe
he was framed</i>

27:39.542 --> 27:42.000
feel the cops saw
there is a reward,

27:42.083 --> 27:43.334
they wanted the money,

27:43.417 --> 27:47.000
they wanted the prestige
of solving this big case,

27:47.083 --> 27:50.959
and so, they picked on Weger,
and framed him.

27:51.042 --> 27:53.375
Person:
<i>Do you ask us to hold this</i>

27:53.459 --> 27:57.334
to the standard of 2005,
or to the standard of 1960

27:57.417 --> 27:58.959
when the case was first, uh--

27:59.042 --> 28:02.250
I ask you to hold it
to the standard of today,

28:02.334 --> 28:03.626
and I think that--

28:03.709 --> 28:06.083
In today's
criminal justice system,

28:06.167 --> 28:09.167
hopefully, hopefully
this would never happen.

28:09.250 --> 28:11.709
David:
<i>I think police</i>
<i>like Bill Dummett believed,</i>

28:11.792 --> 28:13.542
to be a cop in the late '50s,

28:13.626 --> 28:17.751
pushing criminals around
was part of the appeal
of being a policeman.

28:17.834 --> 28:20.959
Right.
They went after him,
and they got him.

28:21.042 --> 28:24.209
<i>That was the only time
I met Dave Raccuglia.</i>

28:24.292 --> 28:25.959
<i>It's like,</i>

28:26.042 --> 28:29.709
"This is a pro-Chester film

28:29.792 --> 28:31.375
"that you're making.

28:31.459 --> 28:34.918
What's your dad
gonna do to you?"

28:35.000 --> 28:37.626
I wouldn't be real happy
if my child did that.

28:37.709 --> 28:41.417
Do you think Weger's not guilty?
Is that what you're trying
to prove here?

28:41.500 --> 28:44.125
A lot of people think
he's innocent.

28:44.209 --> 28:46.834
A lot of people in this town
believe he's innocent.

28:46.918 --> 28:50.959
All, all of these are myths
that, that are created by people

28:51.042 --> 28:53.334
who don't know the inside story,

28:53.417 --> 28:57.083
and I'm telling you,
Chester Weger is not innocent,

28:57.167 --> 28:59.334
so I don't know
what you're trying to gain

28:59.417 --> 29:02.375
by presenting
this type of documentary.

29:02.459 --> 29:05.709
I don't think you'll ever
be able to show, uh,

29:05.792 --> 29:07.876
anything other than the fact
that he's guilty.

29:07.959 --> 29:09.417
Do you feel that...

29:09.500 --> 29:12.042
the questions that
are out there today,

29:12.125 --> 29:13.542
why I'm here
making this film,

29:13.626 --> 29:16.000
is because of the way
the investigation
was handled?

29:16.083 --> 29:19.250
Yes.
Everybody that was involved
in the investigation,

29:19.334 --> 29:22.125
in my opinion,
did a terrible job,

29:22.209 --> 29:24.751
but if you read
my final argument,

29:24.834 --> 29:28.834
I don't think you'll hear
more than about five or 10
minutes on the confessions

29:28.918 --> 29:32.834
because I knew that there
were holes in that confession.

29:32.918 --> 29:34.417
I don't know
that the confessions

29:34.500 --> 29:36.751
might, might've even had
as much of an impact

29:36.834 --> 29:38.417
as that buckskin jacket.

29:38.500 --> 29:42.626
That was a source
of information that didn't
come from Harland Warren,

29:42.709 --> 29:46.751
it didn't come
from Bill Dummett.
It was human blood.

29:46.834 --> 29:50.667
David:
<i>The buckskin jacket</i>
<i>is something my father,</i>

29:50.751 --> 29:53.042
<i>as an attorney,
was really hung up on.</i>

29:53.125 --> 29:56.792
<i>That was an important part
of the prosecution.</i>

29:56.876 --> 30:01.792
There was no indication
of human blood on my jacket
at all until September.

30:01.876 --> 30:05.209
<i>Prior to that time,
they were saying that
the blood on my jacket</i>

30:05.292 --> 30:07.209
<i>was animal blood, which it was.</i>

30:07.292 --> 30:11.209
It was either raccoon blood
or, or, uh, squirrel blood,
and I hunted both animals.

30:11.292 --> 30:13.292
-David: Do what now?
-Franz Zwergel: Can we, can we
have you hold up the jacket

30:13.375 --> 30:16.000
-again (inaudible) pull the tag,
so we can see the (inaudible)?
-Sure, okay.

30:16.083 --> 30:17.918
Franz:
<i>I was with David when</i>
<i>we were filming the evidence,</i>

30:18.000 --> 30:20.250
<i>and we saw the buckskin jacket.</i>

30:20.334 --> 30:23.042
It was a pure passion project
for him,

30:23.125 --> 30:26.167
and when he presented
things that he had found,

30:26.250 --> 30:28.167
I, too, became
impassioned with it.

30:29.918 --> 30:32.250
David:
<i>I was a little shocked</i>
<i>by the evidence.</i>

30:32.334 --> 30:36.334
<i>I was really
more emotionally distraught
over the women's clothes.</i>

30:36.417 --> 30:39.834
<i>It was the scarf and the coats.
They had all this blood.</i>

30:39.918 --> 30:43.542
<i>And then, I saw a little
name tag that said
"Chester Weger,"</i>

30:43.626 --> 30:45.083
<i>and there it was
on the suede jacket.</i>

30:45.167 --> 30:48.083
I was very surprised
there was very little blood

30:48.167 --> 30:49.876
<i>visible on the jacket.</i>

30:49.959 --> 30:51.334
Let me put it this way.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.459
From having seen
the buckskin jacket,

30:53.542 --> 30:57.918
from having seen the photos
of the crime scene,

30:58.000 --> 31:00.834
<i>there would've been
so much blood.</i>

31:00.918 --> 31:05.709
There is no way that jacket
was a jacket that he "wore"

31:05.792 --> 31:08.876
when he committed those murders.

31:08.959 --> 31:10.417
It's impossible.

31:12.584 --> 31:14.209
Donna:
<i>The blood on the jacket was</i>

31:14.292 --> 31:16.584
<i>never typed to any
of these women.</i>

31:16.667 --> 31:18.792
I filed a motion
for DNA testing.

31:18.876 --> 31:21.292
The hope's to show,
through forensic evidence,

31:21.375 --> 31:23.626
that Mr. Weger did not commit
these offenses.

31:23.709 --> 31:26.334
John:
<i>Now Weger's attorney</i>
<i>wants Weger's jacket</i>

31:26.417 --> 31:28.792
<i>with blood splattered on it,
and hair from one</i>

31:28.876 --> 31:30.959
<i>of the victim's hands
tested for DNA,</i>

31:31.042 --> 31:34.667
<i>but there are some unique
problems in a 44-year-old case.</i>

31:34.751 --> 31:38.167
Do you guys want me looking
at the cameras or at him or...?

31:38.250 --> 31:41.834
I, I was called upon
to, basically, conduct
an investigation

31:41.918 --> 31:44.876
into how much of the evidence
still existed,

31:44.959 --> 31:49.250
and whether or not we
could, actually, do anything
with that evidence.

31:49.334 --> 31:50.918
Back in those days,

31:51.000 --> 31:54.751
when a, when a case had
completed all of its appeals,

31:54.834 --> 31:56.209
the evidence was destroyed.

31:56.292 --> 32:00.542
Th-The fact that any evidence
in this case exists at all

32:00.626 --> 32:03.792
is sheerly coincidental
and mostly because

32:03.876 --> 32:07.250
<i>of the, the hype surrounding
this case.</i>

32:07.334 --> 32:10.792
<i>If I had to guess
how many people
have touched this evidence,</i>

32:10.876 --> 32:13.292
the number would have to be
in the hundreds.

32:13.375 --> 32:15.167
I've touched that evidence
over the 60 years.

32:15.250 --> 32:17.876
I've touched the camera,
I touched the binoculars.

32:17.959 --> 32:20.918
I touched the clothes,
I've touched Weger's jacket.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.125
I've touched the murder weapon.

32:23.209 --> 32:25.417
Should I have?
I don't know.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.626
I didn't break
any laws doing it.

32:27.709 --> 32:30.125
Donna:
<i>It was shocking</i>
<i>that the evidence</i>

32:30.209 --> 32:31.876
<i>had been so compromised.</i>

32:31.959 --> 32:36.792
<i>Just to give you an example,
the bloody clothes of the women</i>

32:36.876 --> 32:40.751
were stored in the same bag
as Mr. Weger's jacket.

32:40.834 --> 32:43.459
So, that, that was--
Pretty much shot down
the hopes you had

32:43.542 --> 32:46.209
through the testing that
you could absolve Mr. Weger.

32:46.292 --> 32:49.042
Kathy Etz:
<i>I wish we could test</i>
<i>the DNA evidence.</i>

32:49.125 --> 32:51.626
<i>I absolutely wish
that they could test it,</i>

32:51.709 --> 32:53.959
but the idea that,
because we can't

32:54.042 --> 32:56.792
that means he's innocent,
that does not follow for me.

32:56.876 --> 33:01.292
I, I will say, I think
my whole family does believe,

33:01.375 --> 33:04.918
you know, the idea that one man
overpowered three women

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
does not make
a whole lot of sense to us.

33:07.083 --> 33:09.584
<i>That there must have been
other individuals,</i>

33:09.667 --> 33:12.334
or there must be some
other things going on for him

33:12.417 --> 33:15.459
to be able to overpower
three women.

33:18.125 --> 33:21.459
David:
<i>I feel sorry</i>
<i>for the victims' families.</i>

33:21.542 --> 33:24.250
<i>They still have questions.</i>

33:24.334 --> 33:26.375
<i>Just like Chester's family.</i>

33:26.459 --> 33:28.834
I would want clarity.

33:32.125 --> 33:34.751
<i>So, when I went back
to Chester's sister,</i>

33:34.834 --> 33:36.709
<i>that's what I focused on.</i>

33:36.792 --> 33:40.667
<i>I think she found it very hard
to believe that I could make</i>

33:40.751 --> 33:45.000
<i>a fair story,
and not be biased
towards my father.</i>

33:45.083 --> 33:48.500
<i>But I kept trying
to get her to understand</i>

33:48.584 --> 33:50.626
that we had good intentions.

33:52.876 --> 33:58.375
Mary:
Doing this, I-I'm doing it
for my brother.

33:58.459 --> 34:01.667
My brother has lost
his whole life over this.

34:01.751 --> 34:03.209
Uh...

34:03.292 --> 34:07.292
he's lost his kids,
growing up with his kids.

34:07.375 --> 34:09.792
His wife died of cancer.

34:09.876 --> 34:11.459
She's gone.

34:11.542 --> 34:13.542
Mom and Dad are both gone.

34:13.626 --> 34:19.000
And... I just don't want
my brother to die in prison.

34:23.751 --> 34:25.709
<i>We were a very poor family.</i>

34:25.792 --> 34:30.334
<i>You might as well say we were
dirt poor because we were.</i>

34:30.417 --> 34:32.459
<i>Uh, mother made a lot
of our clothes.</i>

34:32.542 --> 34:35.626
<i>We got a lot
of homemade Christmas presents.</i>

34:35.709 --> 34:38.626
<i>We had water
that had to be carried in.</i>

34:38.709 --> 34:40.459
<i>But, you know,
as you're growing up,</i>

34:40.542 --> 34:42.250
<i>you don't think
of those things.</i>

34:42.334 --> 34:44.667
<i>We were a very loving family.</i>

34:44.751 --> 34:46.459
<i>A lot of hugging,
a lot of kissing.</i>

34:46.542 --> 34:49.500
<i>That was just Mom and Dad.</i>

34:49.584 --> 34:51.334
<i>Why they picked him?</i>

34:51.417 --> 34:53.542
<i>Is it because we were poor?</i>

34:53.626 --> 34:57.375
<i>Is it because we lived
on the wrong side
of the tracks?</i>

34:57.459 --> 34:59.959
Why did they pick him?

35:00.042 --> 35:03.000
<i>I, I could never,
ever imagine my brother</i>

35:03.083 --> 35:04.751
<i>doing something like this.</i>

35:04.834 --> 35:09.500
I've-- Can never, ever remember
my brother being angry or upset.

35:09.584 --> 35:14.626
David:
<i>He has no violence in his past</i>
<i>as far as a criminal record?</i>

35:14.709 --> 35:16.667
No, not that I know of, no.

35:16.751 --> 35:21.042
The, uh, petitioner does have
a history of sexual assaults.

35:21.125 --> 35:26.292
He was arrested as a 12-year-old
for statutory rape.

35:26.375 --> 35:28.709
Uh, I am not clear
whether he was adju--

35:28.792 --> 35:30.751
actually, even adjudicated
delinquent minor, I--

35:30.834 --> 35:34.209
-He was.
-Donna: Okay, again,
he was 12 years old.

35:34.292 --> 35:38.751
David:
<i>The only thing that turned up</i>
<i>in Chester's history is,</i>

35:38.834 --> 35:40.459
when he was 12 years old,

35:40.542 --> 35:43.000
a sexual assault charge
to a younger girl.

35:43.083 --> 35:46.709
No, uh, I, I can never,
I can never remember

35:46.792 --> 35:49.375
anything like that
growing up as a child.

35:50.876 --> 35:52.667
Chester:
<i>There was a girl</i>
<i>in my hometown,</i>

35:52.751 --> 35:56.167
<i>her, her father had told me
to watch over her.</i>

35:56.250 --> 35:59.959
She was younger than me,
and one night when I was
throwing newspapers,

36:00.042 --> 36:03.542
<i>I was going home,
I heard crying.</i>

36:03.626 --> 36:07.167
<i>The girl was raped,
and I'd helped her dress,</i>

36:07.250 --> 36:08.626
<i>I carried her home.</i>

36:08.709 --> 36:11.918
<i>That night the police
arrested me on a rape charge.</i>

36:12.000 --> 36:16.042
This girl's father
talked to a judge in Ottawa,

36:16.125 --> 36:18.083
and he made
the police release me.

36:18.167 --> 36:19.918
We was never shunned about it.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.626
Our life went on the same way,

36:21.709 --> 36:23.542
and I mean, we still
played together.

36:25.292 --> 36:27.125
David:
<i>That was his side of the story.</i>

36:27.209 --> 36:30.876
<i>He was assisting someone
who had already been raped.</i>

36:30.959 --> 36:34.083
Again, more complication.

36:40.626 --> 36:42.834
Anthony:
<i>Donna Kelly did her job.</i>

36:42.918 --> 36:46.292
She's a lawyer,
and I understand
a pretty good lawyer.

36:46.375 --> 36:49.292
But when they filed
that petition,

36:49.375 --> 36:53.083
he convinced her
to put in that petition

36:53.167 --> 36:56.125
a whole completely new alibi,

36:56.209 --> 36:59.959
that he was in Oglesby
getting a haircut

37:00.042 --> 37:02.959
the day
of this particular murder.

37:03.042 --> 37:06.667
Why didn't he bring that out
at the time of the trial?

37:06.751 --> 37:09.417
His alibi
was entirely different.

37:09.500 --> 37:12.083
His alibi was
he was writing a letter.

37:13.584 --> 37:15.751
David:
<i>At the trial, Chester said</i>

37:15.834 --> 37:18.876
<i>during the time of the murders
he was writing a letter</i>

37:18.959 --> 37:22.876
<i>in a small little room
at the Starved Rock Lodge,</i>

37:22.959 --> 37:25.751
but we found out in 2003

37:25.834 --> 37:29.417
that that wasn't
Chester's alibi.

37:29.500 --> 37:32.209
<i>According
to the clemency petition,</i>

37:32.292 --> 37:34.667
<i>he went to Oglesby
with Stanley Tucker,</i>

37:34.751 --> 37:38.125
<i>got a haircut
at Ben Franklin's Barber Shop,</i>

37:38.209 --> 37:42.083
<i>and then, he picked a ride up
in Oglesby, and went to work.</i>

37:43.584 --> 37:46.083
Donna:
<i>Mr. Franklin signed</i>
<i>an affidavit last year</i>

37:46.167 --> 37:49.667
<i>indicating that Mr. Weger
was at his barber shop</i>

37:49.751 --> 37:52.667
during the time frame
which the state, uh,

37:52.751 --> 37:55.125
believes that these women
were killed.

37:55.209 --> 37:58.626
<i>When John McNamara
called Stanley Tucker</i>

37:58.709 --> 38:01.626
<i>to testify
as a defense witness,</i>

38:01.709 --> 38:04.667
<i>Stanley Tucker,
all of a sudden,
had memory failure.</i>

38:04.751 --> 38:09.626
He couldn't recall whether
or not he even saw Chester Weger
on March 14th, 1960.

38:09.709 --> 38:11.626
(David speaking)

38:11.709 --> 38:13.125
Chester:
<i>I had to.</i>

38:33.459 --> 38:37.792
Sandra Bland:
We're on First and Joliet Street
in LaSalle, Illinois,

38:37.876 --> 38:41.125
the former
Robinhood Restaurant.

38:41.209 --> 38:43.209
The kids would hang out here,

38:43.292 --> 38:46.334
and have, like
french fries and soda.

38:46.417 --> 38:47.709
And back here,

38:47.792 --> 38:50.292
that's where I saw
Stanley Tucker

38:50.375 --> 38:52.542
when I came out from work.

38:52.626 --> 38:55.834
David:
<i>Stanley Tucker</i>
<i>passed away in 2006.</i>

38:55.918 --> 38:58.542
You know,
I was trying to figure out

38:58.626 --> 39:01.209
why he would lie on the stand.

39:01.292 --> 39:03.542
Mary, Chester's sister, told me

39:03.626 --> 39:06.209
<i>that she knew someone who had
something to say about that.</i>

39:06.292 --> 39:10.709
Tell me about the night
that you were at the Robinhood.

39:10.792 --> 39:13.209
How old were you on that night?

39:13.292 --> 39:15.375
15.

39:15.459 --> 39:18.459
<i>I was just getting
done working,</i>

39:18.542 --> 39:22.667
<i>and this black car pulled up
with no lights on,</i>

39:22.751 --> 39:24.250
<i>and it was dark,</i>

39:24.334 --> 39:28.334
<i>and it was Stanley Tucker
and his girlfriend.</i>

39:28.417 --> 39:30.792
<i>Stanley said to me,
"Come here."</i>

39:30.876 --> 39:35.876
<i>So, I walked around the car
to the driver's side.</i>

39:35.959 --> 39:40.459
<i>This was during
Chester Weger's trial.</i>

39:40.542 --> 39:42.250
<i>And Stanley said,</i>

39:42.334 --> 39:44.959
"I testified
against Chester today,"

39:45.042 --> 39:47.292
and I asked him,
I said, "What did you do?"

39:47.375 --> 39:49.417
And he said,
"Well, I lied on,

39:49.500 --> 39:52.667
on the stand,"
he said, and--

39:52.751 --> 39:55.292
"Because," he said,
"they threatened me."

39:55.375 --> 39:58.542
<i>He said, "I couldn't tell them</i>

39:58.626 --> 40:01.500
<i>"that Chester didn't do it
in the courtroom</i>

40:01.584 --> 40:05.000
<i>'cause I didn't wanna spend
the rest of my life in prison."</i>

40:05.083 --> 40:07.375
He got really scared,
and he said,

40:07.459 --> 40:08.751
"You can't say nothing,"

40:08.834 --> 40:12.083
he said, "because what they'll
do is they'll either hurt you,

40:12.167 --> 40:14.584
"or they're gonna
hurt your family.

40:14.667 --> 40:17.000
Don't ever say nothing
to nobody."

40:17.083 --> 40:20.751
He said, "I gotta go before,
before the cops see me."

40:22.375 --> 40:25.292
<i>That was the last
I ever saw them.</i>

40:30.209 --> 40:32.500
David:
It's okay, you're doing great.

40:33.918 --> 40:35.375
What are people scared of?

40:35.459 --> 40:38.584
You think it's the authorities,
the sheriffs?

40:38.667 --> 40:40.751
I ain't never asked.

40:40.834 --> 40:44.292
I was just so scared,
I never asked, you know,

40:44.375 --> 40:46.876
who, who
he was talking about.

40:46.959 --> 40:49.792
I figured it had to be
the police.

40:49.876 --> 40:51.876
The state got
to Stanley Tucker,

40:51.959 --> 40:53.626
and it was the state
that got to him.

40:53.709 --> 40:56.083
I don't know who did it,
and he got up,

40:56.167 --> 40:59.292
and he didn't say
what they had done that day.

40:59.375 --> 41:02.876
So, what was my brother supposed
to say, "Well, Stanley Tucker
gave me a ride?"

41:02.959 --> 41:05.250
McNamara said, "That'll
never hold up in court."

41:05.334 --> 41:07.709
And you're gonna do exactly
what he tells you to do

41:07.792 --> 41:09.751
because he knows the law.

41:09.834 --> 41:12.876
David:
<i>I found those stories</i>
<i>incredibly interesting.</i>

41:12.959 --> 41:14.209
Well, I think we're finished.

41:14.292 --> 41:18.042
<i>I felt like Chester
had an alibi,</i>

41:18.125 --> 41:23.459
and it was like, "We've got
this Oswald-type character.

41:23.542 --> 41:25.459
"He's the perfect one
to frame this on.

41:25.542 --> 41:27.667
Let's go after him,
and get him."

41:29.834 --> 41:33.542
At one point, I'll say
that David was obsessed

41:33.626 --> 41:36.876
with getting Chester Weger
released from prison.

41:36.959 --> 41:39.918
<i>He was sure of his innocence.</i>

41:40.000 --> 41:44.417
David:
<i>I couldn't believe that this</i>
<i>frail little guy in front of me</i>

41:44.500 --> 41:47.334
was capable
of what he was convicted of.

41:48.584 --> 41:50.626
(Chester speaking)

41:52.209 --> 41:54.250
(camera shutter clicking)

41:54.334 --> 41:56.209
I know if someone
killed my mother,

41:56.292 --> 41:58.042
I'd wanna know who done it.

41:58.125 --> 41:59.876
David:
<i>We found out a lot of stuff.</i>

41:59.959 --> 42:03.918
I mean, there's, there's
hundreds of people on camera
saying you're innocent,

42:04.000 --> 42:07.292
<i>but unless we get
a smoking gun in this film,</i>

42:07.375 --> 42:09.375
<i>actually, uncovering
a murderer,</i>

42:09.459 --> 42:13.792
you won't get out
just from us making this film.

42:13.876 --> 42:17.083
(indistinct chatter)

42:17.167 --> 42:18.876
Dave:
<i>The brutality of the murders,</i>

42:18.959 --> 42:24.709
I think, is consistent with, uh,
a motivated outside third party

42:24.792 --> 42:28.459
that had a grudge
against these women.

42:28.542 --> 42:31.667
It was obvious to me
that Chester had
nothing to do with it

42:31.751 --> 42:33.751
from a bunch
of different sources.

42:33.834 --> 42:37.626
Well, if Chester didn't do it,
then who did it?

42:37.709 --> 42:42.000
Then, actually, a big break
came when we discovered...

42:44.250 --> 42:46.292
this guy, Smokey Wrona.

42:46.375 --> 42:50.918
I-It's pinned to the top of my,
uh, Starved Rock Murders
Facebook group.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.584
<i>Um, say your name,
and then, just tell your story.</i>

42:53.667 --> 42:56.459
<i>My name is Alice Wrona.</i>

42:56.542 --> 43:00.167
My brother was
Harold "Smokey" Wrona.

43:00.250 --> 43:03.417
And before he died in 2005,

43:03.500 --> 43:06.292
he started talking
about prisons and whatnot.

43:06.375 --> 43:09.375
Then I start asking him
questions, and...

43:09.459 --> 43:10.834
(clears throat)

43:10.918 --> 43:16.209
I was really shocked
when I got some of the answers.

43:16.292 --> 43:20.125
-Dave: Your brother did?
<i>-He's one of the killers, yes.</i>

43:20.209 --> 43:21.417
Dave:
<i>Really?</i>

43:25.918 --> 43:28.250
<i>Smokey confessed to her that</i>

43:28.334 --> 43:30.292
<i>he was one of
the primary people</i>

43:30.375 --> 43:32.375
<i>involved with
the Starved Rock murders.</i>

43:32.459 --> 43:35.375
Yeah, he was, basically,
the local muscle.

43:35.459 --> 43:37.667
Smokey Wrona
was the one criminal

43:37.751 --> 43:40.334
responsible for everything
in my hometown.

43:40.417 --> 43:42.209
If something bad happened,

43:42.292 --> 43:44.334
uh, the cops need to go
talk to Smokey.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.542
Dave:
<i>Alice Wrona, she estimates</i>

43:51.626 --> 43:54.709
<i>that he's killed 13 people.</i>

43:54.792 --> 43:57.918
The very lifeblood
of organized crime

43:58.000 --> 44:00.751
is gambling, prostitution,
and that sort of thing.

44:00.834 --> 44:02.792
Dan:
<i>The Illinois Crime Commission,</i>

44:02.876 --> 44:04.542
were seven counties
they considered

44:04.626 --> 44:06.209
infested with organized crime.

44:06.292 --> 44:09.042
<i>Two of those seven counties
were LaSalle County right here,</i>

44:09.125 --> 44:11.792
<i>and Bureau County,
which is right next door.</i>

44:11.876 --> 44:15.334
Smokey's crew, they were
involved with organized crime

44:15.417 --> 44:17.334
around LaSalle County, you know?

44:17.417 --> 44:18.792
It wasn't his idea.

44:18.876 --> 44:22.042
He got paid $25,000
according to Alice.

44:22.125 --> 44:24.542
<i>You know, it was really
the husbands of the women</i>

44:24.626 --> 44:26.500
<i>that were
the motivation behind this.</i>

44:26.584 --> 44:28.751
One was in a very bitter fight.

44:28.834 --> 44:30.417
He wanted divorce
from his wife,

44:30.500 --> 44:35.417
and, uh, she wasn't giving it,
so he had planned this.

44:35.500 --> 44:39.042
And my brother got $25,000.

44:39.125 --> 44:45.626
The theory was that Mr. Murphy
got a new secretary.

44:45.709 --> 44:48.334
They got a little frisky,
and she became pregnant.

44:48.417 --> 44:51.834
<i>He tried to get a divorce,
and Mrs. Murphy wouldn't
give it to him.</i>

44:51.918 --> 44:53.792
Well, that's a clear motive.

44:53.876 --> 44:56.167
Six weeks after
the Starved Rock murders,

44:56.250 --> 44:58.000
<i>he married his secretary.</i>

44:58.083 --> 45:00.042
<i>If you go to
the public library,</i>

45:00.125 --> 45:02.584
<i>you can see the wedding
announcement, May 5th.</i>

45:02.667 --> 45:04.125
<i>So, that's six weeks after.</i>

45:04.209 --> 45:09.417
Well, the previous Mrs. Murphy,
her body's still warm.

45:09.500 --> 45:11.334
There's a typo, I think,
in the date.

45:11.417 --> 45:13.626
If you look at the news clipping
in archives,

45:13.709 --> 45:16.792
<i>it looks like he got
remarried like six weeks
after the murders,</i>

45:16.876 --> 45:19.083
<i>when, actually, I believe
it was like a couple years.</i>

45:19.167 --> 45:21.834
<i>So, people point to that,
and say, aha!</i>

45:21.918 --> 45:23.542
I find that preposterous.

45:23.626 --> 45:27.459
Y-You have to fill it in,
but, you know, it's, it's--
It just seems obvious.

45:27.542 --> 45:29.209
You are so irresponsible.

45:29.292 --> 45:34.209
There's no way that
you could know anything
about what was going on in 1960,

45:34.292 --> 45:37.375
<i>and these people didn't speak
to any member of my family.</i>

45:37.459 --> 45:39.500
<i>To me, that's inexcusable.</i>

45:39.584 --> 45:42.667
It's just absolutely false.

45:42.751 --> 45:44.751
<i>I asked how many people
were involved.</i>

45:44.834 --> 45:48.584
<i>He says he knows
of 18 people and possibly 21.</i>

45:48.667 --> 45:52.626
Steve:
<i>That's insanity.</i>
<i>18 people can't keep a secret.</i>

45:52.709 --> 45:53.792
<i>$20,000?</i>

45:53.876 --> 45:56.626
You could buy two houses
with that back then.

45:56.709 --> 46:00.292
David:
<i>Is it ridiculous?</i>
<i>Yeah, probably.</i>

46:00.375 --> 46:04.125
<i>And it's a really
blatant attack on a group
of innocent people</i>

46:04.209 --> 46:07.542
that just, their mother died.

46:12.417 --> 46:15.500
<i>I was very much trying
to get to the bottom</i>

46:15.584 --> 46:18.125
of all these
conspiracy theories.

46:18.209 --> 46:21.083
<i>I went down every avenue.</i>

46:21.167 --> 46:24.918
<i>Stories that didn't
really add up.</i>

46:25.000 --> 46:27.083
But it wasn't all lies.

46:27.167 --> 46:30.918
If Chester Weger then is
innocent, who do you suppose
could've done these things?

46:31.000 --> 46:34.667
Well, my opinion on that,

46:34.751 --> 46:39.167
I do have an opinion as to who
may have committed the murders.

46:39.250 --> 46:41.167
I would rather not go
into that,

46:41.250 --> 46:44.250
but I do believe
it was two individuals
who committed the murders,

46:44.334 --> 46:47.709
and one of them
is deceased at this time.

46:49.626 --> 46:54.292
David:
Donna Kelly had a theory
of who could have done this.

46:54.375 --> 46:56.542
Did she mention a name?

47:00.876 --> 47:04.000
Mary:
<i>During her last days</i>
<i>on the case,</i>

47:04.083 --> 47:07.083
<i>she told us that she gave
the state's attorney</i>

47:07.167 --> 47:09.834
<i>two names that she wanted
to have investigated.</i>

47:19.459 --> 47:22.292
<i>One name was Spiros.</i>

47:22.375 --> 47:23.918
<i>Just days later,</i>

47:24.000 --> 47:27.334
after she turned the two names
in to be investigated,

47:27.417 --> 47:31.667
a phone call come in
that George Spiros was dead.

47:33.834 --> 47:37.918
<i>Spiros had left his groceries
on the doorstep.</i>

47:42.292 --> 47:44.584
<i>He went into the house...</i>

47:48.083 --> 47:52.709
<i>and evidently killed him
and his dog.</i>

47:58.667 --> 48:02.792
Who would shoot their dog,
then shoot themselves,

48:02.876 --> 48:04.959
whilst naked
from the waist down,

48:05.042 --> 48:08.834
after having possibly gone
grocery shopping for the week?

48:11.876 --> 48:16.042
David:
<i>George Spiros</i>
<i>was the son of Nick Spiros</i>

48:16.125 --> 48:19.626
<i>who owned and maintained
and ran the lodge.</i>

48:19.709 --> 48:22.876
Who, who is responsible for you
being here, do you believe?

48:22.959 --> 48:24.626
I think, I think that...

48:30.375 --> 48:34.959
<i>He said that he seen me
and Stanley talking
to these three women.</i>

48:35.042 --> 48:37.751
<i>The police were saying,
"Oh, we got an eyewitness here.</i>

48:37.834 --> 48:41.000
"Somebody working here
at Starved Rock seen him
talking to these women,

48:41.083 --> 48:42.375
two workers," you know?

48:42.459 --> 48:44.125
And it was a lie.

48:44.209 --> 48:46.125
In 1960, to begin with,

48:46.209 --> 48:50.167
the first suspect they had
I know was George Spiros.

49:15.709 --> 49:17.918
<i>There's so much money
in-involved in it, you know?</i>

49:18.000 --> 49:19.292
<i>The Spiros are millionaires,</i>

49:19.375 --> 49:23.292
and, and a lot of people say
money talks, you know, and--

49:24.918 --> 49:26.209
David:
<i>He said a lot,</i>

49:26.292 --> 49:30.959
and I did everything I could
to prove it as truth.

49:31.042 --> 49:32.792
That wasn't easy.

49:32.876 --> 49:34.751
If you get mad at me,
get mad at me,
but I'm gonna tell you,

49:34.834 --> 49:37.959
I'm gonna tell you
exactly what, what,
uh, I've heard,

49:38.042 --> 49:40.209
that they were trying
to put a case together

49:40.292 --> 49:42.667
that the potential murderer
was George Spiros.

49:42.751 --> 49:44.709
Spiros, who was
sent away after,

49:44.792 --> 49:46.334
right afterwards,
to boarding school.

49:46.417 --> 49:48.167
What's "right afterwards"
to you?

49:48.250 --> 49:51.083
They'd say,
"Well, after the murders,

49:51.167 --> 49:53.334
George's father
sent him overseas."

49:53.417 --> 49:58.042
Well, that was a few months,
no, it was a, a few weeks,
no, it was a few days.

49:58.125 --> 50:01.125
In the several months
after the Starved Rock murders,

50:01.209 --> 50:02.876
Spiros went back to Greece,

50:03.000 --> 50:06.209
the family's
originally from Greece,
and then, eventually came back.

50:06.292 --> 50:09.876
But, again,
that fed into this theory
that he was the real murderer,

50:09.959 --> 50:13.751
and that he fled the country,
you know, until the heat
died down.

50:17.375 --> 50:20.417
Dave:
<i>This is absolutely</i>
<i>the work of George Spiros.</i>

50:20.500 --> 50:24.709
Rumors are not perpetuated
unless there is some
basis in fact.

50:28.209 --> 50:31.167
I believe George
is one of the killers.

50:31.250 --> 50:34.209
(Chester speaking)

50:34.292 --> 50:36.667
There was a lot of people
in, in 1960

50:36.751 --> 50:40.083
that believed that George Spiros
committed this crime.

50:40.167 --> 50:43.000
Mary:
<i>Donna Kelly,</i>
<i>she got an anonymous letter</i>

50:43.083 --> 50:44.834
<i>that Spiros, when he was young,</i>

50:44.918 --> 50:47.292
he would knock a bird down,

50:47.375 --> 50:49.083
and-- but he wouldn't
really kill it,

50:49.167 --> 50:51.292
and then, he'd watch it squirm.

50:51.375 --> 50:53.626
This is a path of somebody,
you know,

50:53.709 --> 50:56.918
with bigger things in mind
as they get older.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.876
<i>She even put out,
"Whoever sent me the letter,
I'd like to talk to you,"</i>

51:00.959 --> 51:04.709
<i>but the person
never did respond.</i>

51:04.792 --> 51:06.876
David:
One of the suspects
committed suicide, uh--

51:06.959 --> 51:08.751
-He wasn't a suspect.
-David: He was never a suspect.

51:08.834 --> 51:11.542
That's very unfair to do
to the memory of that man.

51:11.626 --> 51:16.000
<i>If you're so set on believing
that Chester Weger's innocent,</i>

51:16.083 --> 51:18.083
<i>do some homework.</i>

51:18.167 --> 51:20.292
<i>George Spiros killed himself</i>

51:20.375 --> 51:23.292
<i>as a personal cure
for his cancer.</i>

51:27.167 --> 51:28.918
David:
<i>Did you ever work</i>
<i>at Starved Rock?</i>

51:29.000 --> 51:32.834
Deedra:
<i>Yes, I worked at Starved Rock</i>
<i>for George Spiros.</i>

51:32.918 --> 51:35.042
He used to really, like...

51:35.125 --> 51:36.751
do spooky things.

51:36.834 --> 51:38.292
Like, we had cabins...

51:39.709 --> 51:42.584
<i>and we would go in there,
and we'd clean.</i>

51:42.667 --> 51:44.792
<i>You know how you get
the feeling like, you know,</i>

51:44.876 --> 51:49.042
<i>there's something
not quite right,
like you're being watched.</i>

51:49.125 --> 51:51.709
<i>And you'd look out,
you know, making the bed,</i>

51:51.792 --> 51:54.167
<i>and there'd be George
in the window watching ya.</i>

51:56.500 --> 51:59.083
<i>Several times,
when I went to leave,</i>

51:59.167 --> 52:01.959
the dogs were there,
and they wouldn't
let me out of the cabin,

52:02.042 --> 52:05.250
and he would stand
out there and laugh at me.

52:05.334 --> 52:08.292
"I enjoyed watching you
bend over that bed."

52:08.375 --> 52:11.167
"You know what I'd like
to do is smack your ass."

52:11.250 --> 52:16.709
<i>H-He abused any woman.
It made him feel powerful.</i>

52:16.792 --> 52:21.250
What clicked for me is when
I saw the crime scene photos.

52:21.334 --> 52:24.667
<i>When I saw those paw prints,
it clicked.</i>

52:24.751 --> 52:30.375
And I believe he had those dogs
hold those women at bay

52:30.459 --> 52:33.000
while he tied them up.

52:39.459 --> 52:41.417
Chester:
<i>Your father knew</i>
<i>I was innocent,</i>

52:41.500 --> 52:44.500
and to, intentionally, to send

52:44.584 --> 52:47.334
an innocent man
to the penitentiary, it's wrong.

52:47.417 --> 52:50.209
David:
How did he know you're innocent?
How did my father know that?

52:50.292 --> 52:51.918
Your father knew I was innocent.

52:52.000 --> 52:57.167
There was nothing
that pointed to me of, of
committing that crime.

52:57.250 --> 52:58.417
Anthony:
<i>He did it.</i>

52:58.500 --> 53:02.667
The only question, David,
is how did he do it?

53:02.751 --> 53:04.918
I, I question that myself.

53:05.000 --> 53:10.209
How can I criticize people
who bring out the fact

53:10.292 --> 53:12.542
that here's a man by himself,

53:12.626 --> 53:16.542
talks these people into
going into the, into the
St. Louis Canyon area,

53:16.626 --> 53:19.626
and I can't because
I don't believe that myself.

53:21.125 --> 53:25.709
I didn't think that Chester's
confessions were the truth.

53:25.792 --> 53:29.542
It's a known fact that people
who give a confession,

53:29.626 --> 53:34.459
sometimes they're not
willing to admit to the facts
that led to the crime,

53:34.542 --> 53:37.209
and I think that's
what happened in this case.

53:37.292 --> 53:41.626
He would not ever admit
to what really happened,

53:41.709 --> 53:42.959
and that was that he

53:43.042 --> 53:45.792
sexually assaulted
Mrs. Murphy.

53:45.876 --> 53:49.584
My theory was inconsistent
with the confession,

53:49.667 --> 53:53.417
but you have to remember
what we're doing here.

53:53.500 --> 53:55.250
We're prosecutors.

53:55.334 --> 53:57.751
We want to convict this man.

53:57.834 --> 54:03.209
Even though we say that some
of those confession statements

54:03.292 --> 54:06.125
are not plausible or truthful.

54:06.209 --> 54:07.834
The part that is truthful

54:07.918 --> 54:11.751
is the fact that he
killed those ladies.

54:11.834 --> 54:15.959
David:
<i>My father said to me he didn't</i>
<i>believe the confession.</i>

54:16.042 --> 54:22.250
He believed Chester Weger's
motive was more sexual
than it was robbery.

54:22.334 --> 54:26.083
He had never really
said that to me before,
and I was a little shocked.

54:29.751 --> 54:32.250
Donna:
<i>The man who</i>
<i>prosecuted Chester Weger,</i>

54:32.334 --> 54:33.792
he has come up
with new theories,

54:33.876 --> 54:36.292
which don't even match
the confessions.

54:36.375 --> 54:38.834
According
to Chester Weger's confession,

54:38.918 --> 54:40.083
the motive was robbery.

54:40.167 --> 54:41.792
Now, 40-some years later,

54:41.876 --> 54:43.959
Mr. Raccuglia
has publicly stated

54:44.042 --> 54:46.959
that he believes the motive
was sexual assault.

54:47.042 --> 54:49.459
This story is so fictional

54:49.542 --> 54:51.626
that a sixth grader reading it
would realize that.

54:51.709 --> 54:54.167
Anthony:
This case of Ms. Kelly's

54:54.250 --> 54:56.709
is built on fantasy
and illusion.

54:56.792 --> 54:58.375
It's cruel to Chester Weger,

54:58.459 --> 55:01.209
if one should be
concerned about that,

55:01.292 --> 55:04.542
to give him any kind of hope.

55:04.626 --> 55:08.000
Mr. Raccuglia talks about
illusion and fantasy
in this petition.

55:08.083 --> 55:12.542
I think the only illusion
and fantasy here is
the confession of Chester Weger.

55:14.584 --> 55:17.167
So, I ask that this board
recommend to the governor

55:17.250 --> 55:19.417
to grant Mr. Weger
an actual pardon.

55:19.500 --> 55:22.459
-Thank you very much,
and thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

55:24.500 --> 55:26.083
John:
<i>Will he ever get out?</i>

55:26.167 --> 55:27.959
Donna:
<i>It's in the governor's hands,</i>

55:28.042 --> 55:29.792
and I honestly do not know

55:29.876 --> 55:31.876
whether he will
release him or not.
