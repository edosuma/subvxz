00:54.760 --> 00:56.159
Pardon me.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.038
Excuse me. Step aside please.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.631
Jesus Christ.

01:03.320 --> 01:07.108
Lee's Diner. I got four down.
I need two EMS vehicles.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.875
What the hell happened here?
Somebody run them over?

01:10.960 --> 01:12.439
No, man, it was a fight.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.474
One guy took them all out
in like seconds.

01:15.560 --> 01:16.675
He's still in there.

01:17.440 --> 01:18.953
That's him.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.998
Turn around, mister.
Let me see your hands.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.028
Slowly.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.313
Military ID.

01:41.640 --> 01:43.039
Expired.

01:43.960 --> 01:46.997
Thirty-eight bucks.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.438
And a toothbrush.

01:52.360 --> 01:53.873
But no home address.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.715
In other words, homeless.

01:57.040 --> 01:59.110
Aggravated assault
is a second-degree felony

01:59.200 --> 02:00.838
in this state, Mister...

02:01.160 --> 02:04.675
Reacher. First name Jack.
No middle name.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.198
You're looking at 10 to 20 years

02:07.280 --> 02:10.078
once those boys you beat
out there are fit to testify.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.389
Process him. Get him to County.

02:13.720 --> 02:17.349
Two things are gonna happen
in the next 90 seconds.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.428
Excuse me?

02:21.200 --> 02:24.237
First, that phone over there
is gonna ring.

02:26.560 --> 02:27.879
And second...

02:28.520 --> 02:31.910
You're gonna be wearing these cuffs
on your way to prison.

02:33.520 --> 02:38.196
Well, that is one magnificent
prophecy, Mr. Reacher.

02:42.520 --> 02:44.158
That'll be a Major Turner

02:44.240 --> 02:48.199
of the 110th C.I.D. Military Police
in Alexandria, Virginia.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.160
You and those boys out there
made a mistake

02:51.240 --> 02:54.357
operating on land
owned by the U.S. Army.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.751
What are you talking about?

02:58.440 --> 03:00.510
Kidnapping illegals.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.353
Selling them.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.556
MPs are on their way now.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.680
If it were up to me, I'd just kill you.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.431
It's just gonna keep on ringing.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.952
Sheriff Raymond Wood.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.596
Who the hell are you?

03:43.960 --> 03:46.155
The guy you didn't count on.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.918
Thank you.

04:29.680 --> 04:32.638
United States Army, 110.
Sergeant Leach.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.233
Major Turner, please.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.799
One moment, please.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.349
This is Turner.

04:42.200 --> 04:43.633
Major S. Turner?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.560
This is she.
Who am I speaking to?

04:46.680 --> 04:47.829
Jack Reacher.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.428
No kidding.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.516
Well, it's nice to finally speak.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.515
Thanks for tipping us off to that Sheriff.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.513
No, I...

04:59.360 --> 05:03.148
I wanted to thank you
for helping me out of a tight spot.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.193
Isn't that what Army folks
do for each other, Major?

05:06.400 --> 05:07.719
Ex-Major.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.195
Oh, once a Major, always a Major.

05:10.520 --> 05:12.875
Where are you calling from?

05:14.040 --> 05:15.519
Outside Independence, I think.

05:15.720 --> 05:16.914
You're not sure.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.390
It doesn't really matter.
I move around a lot.

05:19.680 --> 05:22.035
- So I've heard.
- What else have you heard?

05:22.360 --> 05:25.477
Oh, come on.
You're a legend around here.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.551
Some folks still wonder why you left.

05:28.200 --> 05:32.876
Let's just say I woke up one morning
and the uniform didn't fit.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.074
United States Army, 110.
Sergeant Leach.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.880
Jack Reacher for Major Turner.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.433
Hold on, Major.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.189
Reacher.

05:42.720 --> 05:43.948
How's my office?

05:44.680 --> 05:46.591
I'm sitting here now.

05:46.760 --> 05:49.752
Uh, there is this big dent in the desk.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.195
And people say you made it
with someone's head.

05:52.760 --> 05:53.795
Is that true?

05:54.240 --> 05:56.231
Not my finest hour.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.591
You're not
in trouble again, are you?

05:59.080 --> 06:01.548
I've heard you have a way of finding it.

06:01.920 --> 06:04.753
Or looking for it.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.799
Yeah, I was thinking

06:07.880 --> 06:10.633
maybe I owe you dinner
for what you did.

06:11.280 --> 06:14.317
Oh, well, it took you a while
to come to that conclusion.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.637
When are you coming to D.C.?

06:17.720 --> 06:18.948
I'll get there eventually.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.590
Well, then I won't
hold my breath.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.639
You're not saying anything.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.758
I'm deciding whether
I'd like you in person.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.279
Which way you leaning?

06:30.360 --> 06:31.588
On the fence.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.757
Not sure you could handle me.

06:34.440 --> 06:36.271
I am not worried.

06:36.720 --> 06:40.315
Oh, worry. Just a little.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.153
Take care of yourself, Reacher.

07:03.160 --> 07:05.116
Jack Reacher for Major Turner.

07:05.480 --> 07:08.472
Major Reacher. Sergeant Leach.
We've spoken on the phone.

07:08.680 --> 07:09.680
Welcome back.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.115
Just Reacher.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.839
I'm a civilian now.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.510
Yes, sir. I'll take you up.

07:23.440 --> 07:24.668
I'm sorry. I was...

07:25.040 --> 07:26.400
- Looking for the Major?
- Come in.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.510
Sam Morgan. Please, come in.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.028
Come in.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.119
Have a seat.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.631
Heard a lot about you.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.790
Just stopping by to see Major Turner.

07:38.080 --> 07:40.719
Oh... Well, that's a problem.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.030
Major Turner's been relieved
of her command.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.398
I spoke with her a few days ago.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.073
She's been arrested.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.552
Court-martial's pending.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.513
On what charge?

07:53.040 --> 07:54.393
Espionage.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.639
I'm assuming her duties until
a replacement is assigned.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.552
Something I can help you with?

08:01.640 --> 08:03.995
No. Just a personal visit.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.296
You know each other from
back when you were C.O. here?

08:06.320 --> 08:07.389
Nope. Never met.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.280
I'm sorry to give you
the bad news, Major.

08:11.720 --> 08:12.720
Ex-Major.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.351
Sir, I wanted to warn you.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.517
- But?
- Ordered not to.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.033
Colonel Morgan directly.

08:23.240 --> 08:24.832
Maybe you should warn me now.

08:28.360 --> 08:29.759
Speak freely, Sergeant.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.235
Major Turner is an excellent officer, sir.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.351
Has she been assigned an attorney yet?

08:35.919 --> 08:38.354
Ordered not to give out any
information about that, sir.

08:38.760 --> 08:39.909
Understood.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.356
Always follow orders, Sergeant.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.475
Sir.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.560
Just curious.

08:45.640 --> 08:47.437
Who was your D.I. in boot camp?

08:49.400 --> 08:50.879
Sergeant Greene, sir.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.269
Now, say if Sergeant Greene
were having legal troubles,

08:54.040 --> 08:56.508
would you be able to recommend
an attorney for him?

08:58.600 --> 09:01.160
Oh. Yes. Definitely.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.879
I'd recommend Colonel Moorcroft
over at Fort Dyer

09:03.960 --> 09:06.793
where the high-security
prisoners are confined, sir.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.389
Colonel?

09:15.720 --> 09:19.315
You're the assigned counsel
for Major Susan Turner.

09:20.320 --> 09:23.471
I'm Jack Reacher,
former commander of the 110th.

09:24.720 --> 09:27.359
I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.635
Major Turner requested
under no circumstances

09:29.800 --> 09:31.995
are you to be
granted visitation privileges.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.312
- Why would she say that?
- Maybe she read your file.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.391
"Anti-authority, anti-social..."

09:37.600 --> 09:40.068
- Anti-lawyer.
- Deadbeat dad?

09:40.160 --> 09:41.309
Excuse me?

09:41.680 --> 09:43.671
It says here
you never paid child support.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.109
I'm not a father.

09:45.840 --> 09:49.310
Well, a woman named
Candace Dutton begs to differ.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.353
She contacted the Army
seeking compensation

09:52.520 --> 09:54.909
for her daughter, Samantha Dutton.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.433
She's 15 now.

09:56.760 --> 09:58.990
- It's a mistake.
- They usually are.

09:59.840 --> 10:03.435
Mother's got two priors...
Prostitution. Possession.

10:04.520 --> 10:08.035
The kid's been in and out
of foster care her whole life.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.676
- Any feelings about that?
- About foster care?

10:13.800 --> 10:14.994
Life sucks.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.315
I meant the kid.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.835
I don't have a kid.
I've never heard of Candace Dutton.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.991
I'm here about Major Turner.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.038
What evidence do they have?

10:23.360 --> 10:26.113
A hard drive containing
classified information

10:26.200 --> 10:28.031
found in Major Turner's residence.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.954
The inference being
she's selling secrets.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.708
And that's it?

10:32.880 --> 10:34.950
What do you want, a picture
of her wearing a burka

10:35.040 --> 10:36.553
having drinks with the Taliban?

10:37.480 --> 10:38.799
What did she tell you?

10:39.680 --> 10:41.716
Can't talk to her until tomorrow.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.952
Public Safety Exception.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.679
And you accepted that?

10:46.640 --> 10:48.471
Where'd you get your law degree?

10:49.880 --> 10:51.279
Oh...

10:52.400 --> 10:55.233
It's possible you were once
a good lawyer, Colonel.

10:56.520 --> 10:57.873
But what I see

10:58.160 --> 11:01.232
is a tired lifer who'll do anything
not to endanger his pension.

11:02.680 --> 11:05.592
Let me know when you remember
what that uniform stands for.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.473
Thank you.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.235
How long are we supposed to do this?
I'm getting hungry.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.799
Just be patient.

12:06.880 --> 12:08.376
What do you think
he's eating?

12:08.400 --> 12:09.469
Shut up.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.713
- New gun?
- Yep.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.993
Oh, it's nice.
It makes your hands look big.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.718
Yeah, you like big hands?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.833
Put one of these in your face
in a minute, you carry on.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.234
Hey. Hey, hey! Where'd he go?

12:21.320 --> 12:22.880
I don't know. Maybe went to the pisser.

12:23.600 --> 12:24.896
You're supposed to be watching him.

12:24.920 --> 12:27.957
What do you think I got,
eyes in the back of me head?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.319
How's it going?

12:31.640 --> 12:33.119
Don't.

12:34.600 --> 12:35.919
Show me.

12:37.480 --> 12:38.708
Throw it in back.

12:49.320 --> 12:50.719
I don't like being followed.

14:11.880 --> 14:14.189
I don't like being followed.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.196
On the sidewalk before.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.278
And in the market.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.355
You're a little thief.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.549
- You a cop?
- I look like a cop?

14:35.640 --> 14:36.789
Narc maybe.

14:38.280 --> 14:39.793
You know a lot of narcs?

14:40.040 --> 14:41.189
It's the haircut.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.790
Well, thanks. I did it myself.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.069
So, you're looking for something weird.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.274
See ya.

14:49.480 --> 14:51.436
Are you Candace Dutton's daughter?

14:53.920 --> 14:55.672
- What'd she do this time?
- Nothing.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.234
I'm an old friend.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.435
Yeah?

14:58.520 --> 15:01.353
Well, she's not into doing
that kind of thing anymore.

15:01.640 --> 15:03.232
That's not what I meant.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.952
If you're looking for my mom,
I don't live with her.

15:07.560 --> 15:08.913
Who do you live with?

15:21.440 --> 15:23.040
You were right, Major.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.318
I am tired.

15:26.240 --> 15:27.992
But I'm not stupid.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.514
Sergeants Mirkovich and Cibelli.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.910
Two weeks ago,
Major Turner dispatches them

15:35.000 --> 15:36.911
to Afghanistan on an investigation.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.271
They file reports daily.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.717
Two days ago, they're both found dead
near Bagram Air Base.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.313
Shot at close range.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.514
And the next day,
Major Turner's thrown in prison.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.710
What do you know about Parasource?

15:56.360 --> 15:57.713
Parasource?

15:58.640 --> 16:00.870
It's a big military contractor. Why?

16:01.160 --> 16:02.991
I don't know how
they're involved in all this,

16:03.080 --> 16:05.071
but they've been following me
since I got here.

16:06.480 --> 16:10.792
Whoever killed Mirkovich and Cibelli
wanted Major Turner isolated.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.315
I think they're gonna kill her, too.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.833
What are you talking about?

16:14.920 --> 16:16.936
We have no idea if any
of these things are connected.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.313
We need to get her out.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.312
And might I reiterate,
she does not want you involved.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.392
Do it now. And I'll call you tonight.

17:01.600 --> 17:06.116
People question the value
of enhanced interrogation techniques.

17:06.200 --> 17:09.510
Enhanced interrogation
techniques don't work.

17:09.880 --> 17:13.589
But torture, on the other hand,
works very well.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.518
Attorney-client privilege

17:16.599 --> 17:19.512
goes back to the earliest days
of English Common Law.

17:20.040 --> 17:25.034
It means that Major Turner
told you in confidence

17:25.359 --> 17:29.797
a great deal about what she learned
from her investigation in Afghanistan.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.750
How much did you tell Jack Reacher?

17:37.400 --> 17:39.391
We didn't talk about that.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.719
Of course you did.

17:41.800 --> 17:42.915
Mmm-mmm...

17:44.320 --> 17:46.993
We talked for 10 minutes.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.630
Ten minutes is a very long time,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.036
as you are about to learn.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.229
Jack Reacher?

18:02.600 --> 18:04.989
Colonel Morgan was wondering
if you had a few minutes.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.231
You don't remember me, do you?

18:10.760 --> 18:12.239
Anthony Espin?

18:12.840 --> 18:15.673
Nah. You were still C.O.
when I got here.

18:15.760 --> 18:18.115
Held back my promotion for six months.

18:19.560 --> 18:20.788
Why'd I do that?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.376
'Cause you were
a hard-ass prick who said

18:22.400 --> 18:23.833
I jumped to conclusions.

18:24.920 --> 18:27.275
I'm sure I jumped to conclusions.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.559
Have a seat.

18:41.560 --> 18:44.233
You're under no obligation
to say anything, Major.

18:44.920 --> 18:45.989
Ex-Major.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.549
Upon leaving yesterday,

18:48.640 --> 18:50.437
did you attempt to contact
Major Turner?

18:52.800 --> 18:55.234
Did you confront her attorney,
Colonel Moorcroft,

18:55.360 --> 18:56.793
at Fort Dyer at 1100?

19:03.480 --> 19:05.471
You told me not to say anything.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.439
I said you didn't have to say anything.

19:08.760 --> 19:09.875
Yes.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.433
Yes, you confronted him?

19:11.680 --> 19:13.989
Yes, I understand
I don't have to say anything.

19:14.560 --> 19:17.870
For the record, you did confront
Colonel Moorcroft yesterday.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.751
Can you state your
whereabouts last night

19:20.840 --> 19:22.796
between 0130 and 0500?

19:23.320 --> 19:24.320
Yes.

19:24.640 --> 19:25.640
Yes, what?

19:25.880 --> 19:28.348
Yes, I understand
I don't have to say anything.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.474
Note for the record, the Major
has an injury to his hand

19:34.560 --> 19:36.198
not present during yesterday's meeting.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.119
We're done here.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.270
At approximately 0230 this morning,

19:44.360 --> 19:47.352
Colonel Archibald Moorcroft
was beaten to death.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.719
You're my attorney.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.640
Lieutenant Sullivan. How do you do?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.194
You are hereby charged

19:58.280 --> 20:00.080
with the murder
of a Judge Advocate General...

20:00.160 --> 20:02.469
- Where was he killed?
- In his apartment.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.832
- Off base.
- Yes.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.148
This is a civilian matter.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.549
As a private citizen,
the Army has no jurisdiction.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.073
Turn me over to the D.C. police.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.517
You're familiar with Article
10.75 of the Military Code?

20:14.680 --> 20:16.432
An officer with your security clearance

20:16.520 --> 20:19.432
remains subject to recall
in event of emergency.

20:19.800 --> 20:22.030
You agreed to it
when you signed your discharge.

20:23.440 --> 20:25.078
Welcome back to the Army, Major.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.232
You're under arrest.

20:47.240 --> 20:48.992
Open BA211.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.436
Stand here. Don't move.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.271
Espin, prisoner transfer.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.359
I'll file for disclosure.

21:41.440 --> 21:44.113
They'll turn over whatever
evidence they have on you.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.231
There won't be any evidence.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.216
What are you talking about?

21:49.240 --> 21:52.073
They killed her investigators,
they killed her lawyer.

21:52.440 --> 21:53.696
Evidence suggests

21:53.720 --> 21:55.119
you killed Major Turner's lawyer.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.475
They're gonna kill her,
then they're gonna kill me.

21:57.560 --> 21:58.616
For all I know, you're part of it.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.119
Hey, listen, dickhead.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.758
You're the one accused of murder.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.438
You wanna show me
a shred of evidence,

22:03.520 --> 22:04.919
I'll defend you till kingdom come.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.592
Otherwise, go to hell.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.435
I apologize.

22:08.520 --> 22:10.556
I think I have low blood sugar.

22:10.680 --> 22:12.636
- Excuse me?
- I didn't eat this morning,

22:12.720 --> 22:13.994
feel lightheaded.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.470
Could you get me something
from the officers' mess?

22:16.560 --> 22:17.560
Sandwich, maybe.

22:22.360 --> 22:23.839
Open the door, please.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.033
We're done here.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.879
Move.

23:26.560 --> 23:28.391
Open BA201.

23:51.760 --> 23:54.513
Ma'am, these men are here
to transfer you.

23:55.680 --> 23:56.954
Who are they?

23:59.600 --> 24:01.113
I asked you a question.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.519
Who are they?

24:06.440 --> 24:07.634
Are you gonna answer me?

24:10.280 --> 24:11.508
Reacher?

24:12.320 --> 24:13.514
Halt!

24:13.800 --> 24:15.028
Stand down!

24:15.200 --> 24:16.792
These men are here to kill you.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.076
- They killed Moorcroft.
- Wait, what?

24:19.160 --> 24:20.256
Last night, in his apartment.

24:20.280 --> 24:21.520
And now they're gonna kill you.

24:24.640 --> 24:26.278
Soldier! You know who I am!

24:26.560 --> 24:27.879
I need you to stand down!

24:27.960 --> 24:29.016
You've been relieved
of command, ma'am.

24:29.040 --> 24:30.075
Turner, no time.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.496
I'm being held here without cause.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.112
It is your right to counter...

24:34.080 --> 24:35.593
That soldier was under my command!

24:35.680 --> 24:37.033
We don't have time for this.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.277
Get his badge and his papers.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.995
I left explicit orders
for you to stay away.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.911
- Orders? You "ordered" me?
- Yes.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.558
I knew you'd do something like this.

24:50.640 --> 24:52.392
Don't make me regret it.

24:53.480 --> 24:54.959
Espin? What'd you do to him?

24:56.760 --> 24:58.239
He'll be fine.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.228
- This is insane.
- Does this mean dinner's off?

25:07.680 --> 25:09.910
- Act angry.
- I am angry.

25:10.840 --> 25:11.840
Prisoner transfer.

25:11.920 --> 25:13.296
Lieutenant Sullivan coming in.

25:13.320 --> 25:14.320
Open BA211.

25:20.680 --> 25:22.511
- Hey, wait a second!
- Move!

25:26.840 --> 25:28.956
His keys! Give me his keys!

25:30.200 --> 25:32.953
What kind of car
would my lawyer be driving?

25:33.040 --> 25:34.439
A black sedan.

25:47.720 --> 25:48.936
Survey the perimeter!

25:48.960 --> 25:50.552
Secure the service lot!

25:51.920 --> 25:53.911
- Move! Move! Close in!
- Let's go!

25:54.360 --> 25:55.588
Food truck.

26:06.840 --> 26:08.034
Clear!

26:08.200 --> 26:09.599
They're in the food truck!

26:09.760 --> 26:12.513
Stop that truck! Go, go, go, go!

26:12.680 --> 26:13.829
Go, go!

26:36.120 --> 26:37.792
Get them out of that truck!

26:39.960 --> 26:40.995
Clear!

26:45.600 --> 26:47.272
So now I'm a fugitive from justice.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.749
And a traitor to your country,
don't forget that.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.508
Why do I feel like you're enjoying this?

26:52.880 --> 26:55.519
You have a very interesting way
of saying thank you.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.791
Were those men really going to kill me?

27:02.720 --> 27:03.948
Thank you.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.239
Nice job.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.238
Oh, his ass is mine.

27:09.640 --> 27:12.791
X.O. One of our vehicles
has been hijacked. L67.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.879
All units. Suspects traveling.

27:15.960 --> 27:17.473
MP vehicle L67.

27:17.760 --> 27:20.035
Primary is Jack Reacher.
White. Male. 40s.

27:20.120 --> 27:21.553
Considered armed and dangerous.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.392
Secondary is Major Susan Turner.

27:23.480 --> 27:25.118
Female. Wearing military fatigues.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.270
White. Age 34.

27:27.800 --> 27:29.836
- Really?
- Shut up.

27:30.280 --> 27:32.561
We need to ditch this car
and get into my email.

27:32.920 --> 27:34.256
All right, people, let's go, let's go!

27:34.280 --> 27:35.349
Where the hell are they?

27:35.440 --> 27:37.795
Specialist, have the State Troopers
called back yet?

27:37.880 --> 27:38.949
On it, sir.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.736
All right, has anybody heard
from the Capitol Police?

27:40.760 --> 27:43.194
Anybody? Anything?
A location? Something?

27:57.640 --> 27:59.870
Is there still an Internet café
around here?

27:59.960 --> 28:01.480
Pennsylvania and North Street.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.317
Okay. Take us there, please.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.470
I should have gone
to Afghanistan myself.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.993
Mirkovich and Cibelli
were my responsibility.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.910
The job is about giving orders.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.149
You ever lose anyone
on your watch, Reacher?

28:29.040 --> 28:31.190
My men weren't killed by the Taliban.

28:31.880 --> 28:36.715
They were shot, in the back of the head,
with slugs from an Army-issued 9mm.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.632
By one of our own.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.552
I'm gonna find out who did it.

28:42.920 --> 28:44.400
What were your guys doing over there?

28:44.440 --> 28:45.555
What were they looking for?

28:45.920 --> 28:47.239
Weapons.

28:47.840 --> 28:50.752
Thousands of weapons,
decommissioned during the drawdown.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.031
Whole plane load's gone missing.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.150
Hey, I like your hat.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.390
- You a Nats fan?
- Yeah, from the beginning.

29:05.960 --> 29:09.748
They arrested me the day after
my investigators were killed.

29:09.840 --> 29:12.673
With the time difference,
they might have filed another report.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.475
They locked me up so I wouldn't see it.

29:17.920 --> 29:20.753
Sir, she's trying to access the system.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.911
- Get me that location.
- Yes, sir.

29:24.280 --> 29:25.759
Pennsylvania and North Street.

29:30.440 --> 29:32.510
It's Morgan.
Ready to go to work, soldier?

29:33.120 --> 29:34.553
We've located them.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.518
They're at an Internet café,
Pennsylvania and North Street.

29:37.880 --> 29:39.279
Get it done.

29:41.600 --> 29:43.576
Whatever Mi rkovich
and Cibelli found out

29:43.600 --> 29:44.794
got them killed.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.108
But by who?

29:47.160 --> 29:49.674
Shit. They locked me out.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.656
They're gonna triangulate
this I.P. address.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.398
I know. Just give me a second. Okay?

30:11.480 --> 30:13.840
- They will know this location.
- Let me try one last thing.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.440
- They will know this location.
- Shit.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.469
There's a bus stop
on the other side of the park.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.513
We're being followed.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.239
It's not a cop.

30:44.600 --> 30:45.919
He's a pro.

30:46.160 --> 30:47.160
Where?

30:47.760 --> 30:49.273
Fifty yards.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.476
Black coat, brown hair.

30:58.040 --> 30:59.040
There.

31:09.320 --> 31:11.356
- They made us.
- Maybe.

31:14.920 --> 31:15.920
Restaurant.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.194
Hello.

31:25.320 --> 31:27.390
We're meeting someone in the back.

31:36.880 --> 31:38.871
- Everybody out!
- Let's go!

31:39.240 --> 31:40.559
- Out!
- Move!

31:43.320 --> 31:45.072
Come on! Go, go!

31:52.760 --> 31:54.113
I got this door.

32:45.440 --> 32:47.590
Stay back! Stay back!

32:54.920 --> 32:56.273
No, don't. Stay back!

33:18.160 --> 33:19.912
Police! Freeze!

33:20.240 --> 33:21.992
Drop your weapon.

33:22.320 --> 33:24.197
Sir, I said drop your weapon.

33:24.280 --> 33:25.793
I'm military police!

33:26.160 --> 33:28.196
He's not a cop!

33:29.600 --> 33:31.158
Sir, drop your weapon!

33:31.240 --> 33:32.514
I'm military police.

33:32.840 --> 33:34.910
Sir, I need you to drop your weapon.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.793
Listen, I know what this looks like.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.576
Sir, turn around
and let me see your hands!

33:38.600 --> 33:40.670
I'm putting my weapon down.
Listen to me.

33:40.760 --> 33:41.795
I'm military police.

33:41.880 --> 33:44.758
These two are fugitives
of the United States Army.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.593
I understand. I'm turning around.

33:47.680 --> 33:50.478
Place your hands
behind your head. Now!

33:50.560 --> 33:52.320
My identification's
in my right front pocket.

33:52.360 --> 33:53.395
Will you just check it?

33:53.760 --> 33:54.954
Just check.

34:19.480 --> 34:21.789
Go! Move, move! Go!

34:38.159 --> 34:40.469
We got our signals crossed.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.399
He's good.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.828
We'll get him next time.

34:50.320 --> 34:53.869
You know, I admit to being
a little jealous when we talk.

34:55.199 --> 34:56.713
Go where you want.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.272
Eat when you want.

35:00.160 --> 35:02.628
Nobody telling you
what to do or how to do it.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.591
It's definitely not the Army way.

35:06.360 --> 35:07.679
Exactly.

35:11.120 --> 35:13.031
Let's take a look at that registration.

35:19.280 --> 35:20.952
Parasource?

35:21.040 --> 35:23.349
You think that guy in the kitchen
was one of theirs?

35:23.440 --> 35:25.715
Freelance is my guess.

35:53.880 --> 35:54.915
Go.

35:55.160 --> 35:56.832
Made a mess, I hear.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.629
This Reacher guy is interesting.

35:59.920 --> 36:02.992
You have no idea.
They ran out of medals.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.993
So don't make this a competition.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.389
Too late.

36:07.480 --> 36:09.755
Sure you can handle him by yourself?

36:10.040 --> 36:11.712
I can handle him just fine.

36:12.040 --> 36:13.393
Prove it.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.432
- Coffee?
- Cream?

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
No.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.479
Right sizes.

36:44.440 --> 36:45.440
Good eye.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.238
I spent the rest of our cash.

36:50.520 --> 36:53.318
It's time we stopped running
and start hunting.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.629
Morgan.

36:57.720 --> 36:59.392
Catch you at a bad time?

37:00.440 --> 37:02.556
I hope you're calling
to turn yourselves in.

37:02.640 --> 37:04.056
I don't know your role
in this yet, Colonel.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.274
I'm guessing money.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.590
I promise you I will find out.

37:07.680 --> 37:09.511
Nobody's gonna find anything.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.830
Not even in Major Turner's email?

37:18.680 --> 37:21.114
- Find it yet?
- Nothing to find.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.431
You're not looking hard enough.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.478
Why don't we check my field reports?

37:30.040 --> 37:32.270
I will snap the tendon
before it breaks the bone.

37:32.360 --> 37:33.588
It takes longer to heal.

37:33.760 --> 37:35.478
Locked. Need the code.

37:36.280 --> 37:37.679
1209#.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.394
Mirkovich and Cibelli's field reports.

37:43.480 --> 37:44.799
What else you got on here, huh?

37:55.440 --> 37:56.759
You think you're invulnerable.

37:56.960 --> 37:58.279
Almost done uploading.

37:58.440 --> 38:00.112
But there are ways to get
at you, Reacher.

38:00.440 --> 38:01.555
Got it.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.870
Thanks for all your help, Colonel.

38:20.640 --> 38:24.474
Okay. Mirkovich and Cibelli
did file a final report.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.233
"Warlords..."

38:27.040 --> 38:28.189
Okay, here we go.

38:28.280 --> 38:30.316
The last man they spoke to
was a contractor

38:30.400 --> 38:32.072
named Daniel Prudhomme.

38:32.400 --> 38:35.392
He oversaw weapons transports.
Said he was evasive

38:35.480 --> 38:37.118
then he disappeared.

38:40.480 --> 38:42.630
This is Leach.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.836
This is Sergeant Greene,
your old D.I. Remember me?

38:45.600 --> 38:48.160
Sergeant Greene.
So good to hear from you.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.536
I'm here
with a friend of yours.

38:49.560 --> 38:50.560
We need a favor.

38:50.920 --> 38:53.070
There's a military contractor
called Parasource.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.240
Think you could ask around,

38:54.280 --> 38:55.880
find out what role
they played in Bagram?

38:56.240 --> 38:57.912
I might be able to do that.

38:58.240 --> 39:00.674
Also there's a Parasource
employee named Prudhomme.

39:00.760 --> 39:01.988
We need his whereabouts.

39:02.360 --> 39:03.998
Prudhomme. Copy that.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.593
And, Sergeant.

39:05.920 --> 39:06.920
Carefully.

39:07.280 --> 39:08.280
Sir, yes, sir.

39:14.080 --> 39:15.229
Reacher.

39:56.760 --> 39:57.875
Clear.

40:03.880 --> 40:05.074
Reacher.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.111
Hey, stop, hey!

41:25.200 --> 41:26.519
Let go of me!

41:26.760 --> 41:30.116
- Let go of me! Let go!
- Hey, hey, hey!

41:31.440 --> 41:32.668
Samantha.

41:33.040 --> 41:35.190
It's okay. It's okay.

41:44.640 --> 41:46.949
I don't understand.
You said you're not a cop.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.189
I'm not.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.472
What's military police?

41:50.560 --> 41:51.993
It's different.

41:52.480 --> 41:55.074
But you stole this car.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.870
It's complicated.

41:59.040 --> 42:00.712
Where are you taking me?

42:02.640 --> 42:03.868
We don't know yet.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.558
- Hey, do you have a phone?
- Why?

42:05.640 --> 42:06.640
Just give it to me.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.656
I left it in the apartment
where you kidnapped me.

42:08.680 --> 42:10.113
We didn't kidnap you.

42:10.280 --> 42:12.396
Kidnapping is a federal offense.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.349
Look at me, kid.

42:18.200 --> 42:21.033
There are people out there
who want to hurt you.

42:26.120 --> 42:27.473
I feel sick.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.592
Just put your head out the window.

42:32.560 --> 42:33.709
It doesn't open.

42:33.800 --> 42:35.696
Hey, when was the last time
you had something to eat?

42:35.720 --> 42:38.314
- I don't know.
- We need to get her some food.

42:51.480 --> 42:53.391
How long have you been drawing?

42:53.480 --> 42:55.471
I don't know. Why?

42:56.600 --> 42:58.158
Just asking.

42:59.080 --> 43:00.399
They suck.

43:01.760 --> 43:03.352
Whatever you say.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.392
Beth and Herb were these
two nice old hippies.

43:07.760 --> 43:09.079
Who'd want to kill them?

43:09.480 --> 43:10.959
You've had a shock.

43:11.040 --> 43:12.393
Your body's pumping adrenaline.

43:12.480 --> 43:14.835
Cortisol. They call it fight or flight.

43:15.320 --> 43:17.959
It's gonna take a while to calm down.

43:23.160 --> 43:24.160
Here.

43:25.240 --> 43:28.391
I can't eat. I'm pumping adrenaline.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.638
I know a place she'll be safe.

43:33.880 --> 43:35.029
What does that mean?

43:35.320 --> 43:36.799
I'm not going to a stupid school.

43:36.880 --> 43:38.960
They have a dress code.
This is what they wear there.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.150
I know the headmistress.
You'll be safe there.

43:41.320 --> 43:43.993
"Headmistress?" What is it, a convent?

43:47.600 --> 43:49.238
Do you want to live?

43:49.840 --> 43:50.840
Do you?

43:51.440 --> 43:52.589
Yes.

43:53.000 --> 43:57.073
Then you will go where we say
and stay until we say it's safe.

43:57.440 --> 43:59.078
Do you understand?

44:00.000 --> 44:02.673
You're very intense. You know that?

44:03.200 --> 44:04.713
Yeah, I understand.

44:16.480 --> 44:19.552
- What are you doing here?
- Reacher has the girl.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.915
You were supposed to take care of that.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.115
You people.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.589
You take off the uniform
and lose all discipline.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.672
How did he find her?

44:28.000 --> 44:29.319
Exactly.

44:29.760 --> 44:31.079
How did he?

44:31.400 --> 44:32.674
How would I know?

44:32.760 --> 44:35.718
When he was here, earlier today.

44:37.200 --> 44:38.599
You're watching me now?

44:38.680 --> 44:40.591
Who the hell do you think you are?

44:44.920 --> 44:46.433
What did you give him?

44:46.720 --> 44:48.233
What are you talking about?

44:49.320 --> 44:53.791
What did you give him?

44:54.440 --> 44:57.193
I don't have to be interrogated
by the likes of you.

44:59.360 --> 45:01.510
He came in here with that
bitch and threatened me.

45:01.600 --> 45:03.079
I gave him nothing.

45:04.480 --> 45:05.549
What's so funny?

45:06.040 --> 45:08.634
We hired you to clean up this mess.

45:08.920 --> 45:10.194
You're right.

45:11.440 --> 45:13.192
He touched this phone, didn't he?

45:13.720 --> 45:14.869
So?

45:15.720 --> 45:18.632
That means his prints are on it. Huh?

45:32.760 --> 45:35.593
I mean, really,
if I had any other choice...

45:35.680 --> 45:37.671
It should only be for a few days.

45:37.760 --> 45:40.399
You know how we feel about
you here at Pembroke, Susan.

45:40.480 --> 45:41.879
Well, thank you.

45:41.960 --> 45:44.599
- It's so nice to see you.
- It's good to see you, too...

45:48.960 --> 45:52.555
Show me what you feel.
You are not a camera.

45:52.880 --> 45:55.110
What do you feel about these hands?

45:55.480 --> 45:57.550
Are these nurturing hands?

45:57.880 --> 45:59.711
Have they held children?
Do they carry pain?

45:59.800 --> 46:00.869
Why do we draw?

46:03.320 --> 46:05.117
Welcome to Pembroke. Hi, I'm Olivia.

46:05.240 --> 46:06.309
And I'm May.

46:06.600 --> 46:07.635
Carla.

46:07.880 --> 46:09.313
Come sit with us.

46:09.880 --> 46:11.359
Where'd you go before this?

46:11.440 --> 46:12.714
Different places.

46:13.080 --> 46:15.878
Ooh, travel's really good
for college applications.

46:16.280 --> 46:17.793
Have you taken the PSATs yet?

46:17.920 --> 46:19.360
You need to sign up right away.

46:19.440 --> 46:20.816
May! Oh, my God, your earrings!

46:20.840 --> 46:21.909
Where'd you get them?

46:22.320 --> 46:24.880
Oh, thank you. Actually, my dad
brought them back from New York.

46:24.960 --> 46:27.269
Ah! My parents promised me
some intense retail therapy

46:27.360 --> 46:28.873
when we're in Paris for Christmas.

46:28.960 --> 46:30.951
Wow, Paris.
You guys have been everywhere.

46:31.040 --> 46:32.456
It's beautiful. I've been three times.

46:32.480 --> 46:33.629
Have you ever been?

46:33.720 --> 46:35.711
- No, actually not.
- Can you imagine Christmas?

46:35.800 --> 46:38.837
- It's great. The Eiffel Tower.
- Have you been in it?

46:38.920 --> 46:40.176
Yeah, three times, girl!

46:40.200 --> 46:41.633
Aren't you going to Spain?

46:45.000 --> 46:46.336
You guys are doing
a lot of traveling.

46:46.360 --> 46:47.656
It's awesome.

46:47.680 --> 46:50.672
I'll probably stick around at home.
The usual.

46:54.720 --> 46:56.073
She's gonna do fine.

46:56.280 --> 46:58.350
I don't want you to worry.

47:00.480 --> 47:01.515
What are you doing?

47:01.600 --> 47:03.477
You said you didn't have a phone.

47:03.560 --> 47:04.959
How many times did you use this?

47:05.040 --> 47:06.553
In my life?

47:07.760 --> 47:09.671
Let's go. Get your things.

47:13.160 --> 47:15.390
It was nothing. Just one person.

47:15.520 --> 47:18.637
- Excuse me. We have to go. Thank you.
- It was nothing.

47:18.720 --> 47:20.836
Nance, give me one second. Hey!

47:20.920 --> 47:22.831
Hey, what the hell is going on?

47:22.920 --> 47:24.911
- She was texting.
- Shit!

47:25.000 --> 47:27.355
- What's wrong with that?
- One, they can trace us.

47:28.360 --> 47:29.839
Come on, let's go.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.115
Get in.

47:47.280 --> 47:49.191
God, that place was ridiculous.

47:49.520 --> 47:51.317
That place changed my life.

47:53.400 --> 47:55.231
Sorry about the phone.

47:57.960 --> 47:58.995
Go.

47:59.320 --> 48:01.231
Did some digging about Parasource.

48:01.440 --> 48:03.670
Some of their boys
got into trouble in Afghanistan.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.752
They lost some
big government contracts.

48:05.840 --> 48:07.512
Word is they're in financial trouble.

48:07.760 --> 48:09.398
Why does he get to have a phone?

48:09.480 --> 48:11.914
- This Daniel Prudhomme...
- Hold on. You need to be quiet.

48:12.360 --> 48:14.794
'Kay, sorry. Daniel Prudhomme.
Keep going.

48:15.360 --> 48:18.750
The contractor our guys talked to,
he lives in New Orleans.

48:19.120 --> 48:21.509
He disappeared right after
he was interrogated.

48:21.680 --> 48:24.035
Hitched a ride back home
to his wife and kids.

48:24.200 --> 48:26.111
New Orleans
is Parasource's home base.

48:26.280 --> 48:28.160
They know he's back
and they're looking for him.

48:28.200 --> 48:29.679
We're going to New Orleans.

48:29.880 --> 48:31.438
- Sir, there's something else.
- Yep?

48:32.280 --> 48:33.793
Colonel Morgan was killed.

48:34.280 --> 48:37.192
Your prints were found
on the murder weapon.

48:38.480 --> 48:39.913
Appreciate your help, Sergeant.

48:41.080 --> 48:43.640
We need to find Prudhomme
before Parasource gets a hold of him.

48:43.720 --> 48:45.199
There's an airport at Norfolk.

48:45.720 --> 48:48.632
- We'll need credit cards.
- And IDs.

48:52.360 --> 48:54.669
American Express. Visa.

48:55.440 --> 48:56.589
Discover.

48:57.360 --> 49:02.195
"Daddy is so happy with my SATs
and extracurricular activities,

49:02.960 --> 49:05.679
"he's takin' us all to New Orleans."

49:06.200 --> 49:08.475
Unless you want me to shut up.

49:11.680 --> 49:13.033
You little shit.

49:34.360 --> 49:36.078
Sure about this?

49:36.200 --> 49:37.269
No.

49:37.360 --> 49:38.952
Want me to do it?

49:40.360 --> 49:41.395
No.

49:44.680 --> 49:46.113
Tan jacket.

49:53.200 --> 49:54.349
Yeah.

50:01.960 --> 50:03.359
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

50:03.440 --> 50:04.839
No problem.

50:29.800 --> 50:31.153
Enjoy your flight.

50:39.120 --> 50:41.634
If you're seated
in an emergency exit row,

50:41.720 --> 50:44.792
please review the responsibilities
for emergency exit seating

50:44.880 --> 50:46.950
on the back
of the safety information card

50:47.040 --> 50:49.474
located in the seat pocket
in front of you.

51:06.160 --> 51:07.752
Haven't flown before?

51:11.680 --> 51:12.680
Here.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
You're kidding.

51:16.080 --> 51:17.280
I don't want you puking on me.

51:17.320 --> 51:18.799
I'm not gonna puke.

51:18.880 --> 51:19.949
Good.

51:40.240 --> 51:42.629
So, how long have you been
in the Army for?

51:42.960 --> 51:44.188
Uh...

51:44.840 --> 51:46.478
- Ten years.
- Oh, wow.

51:47.880 --> 51:49.791
- What's your rank?
- Major.

51:50.160 --> 51:55.314
So, if you give a guy orders,
he has to obey.

51:55.400 --> 51:57.550
Like, fast.

51:57.640 --> 51:58.914
Yeah.

51:59.840 --> 52:03.549
And if he tries messing with you,
you know, like, all kinds of moves, right?

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
A few.

52:05.200 --> 52:06.997
Oh, that's badass.

52:07.520 --> 52:09.351
Can I learn some?

52:11.640 --> 52:12.640
Sure.

52:14.840 --> 52:17.354
- You're not married, right?
- No.

52:18.200 --> 52:19.394
Are you gay?

52:19.560 --> 52:21.536
I mean, it's totally cool.
I know tons of lesbians.

52:21.560 --> 52:22.629
No, I'm not gay.

52:22.800 --> 52:24.631
I thought all lady soldiers are gay.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.515
Well, some are, some aren't.
Like out in the real world.

52:30.840 --> 52:33.912
So, is Reacher

52:34.000 --> 52:35.069
your boyfriend?

52:35.640 --> 52:37.790
No.

52:38.280 --> 52:40.589
- Friends with benefits.
- Uh, no.

52:40.680 --> 52:45.117
You mean no, you don't want to,
or no, he doesn't want to, or no, not yet,

52:45.200 --> 52:46.633
you guys haven't really...

52:49.800 --> 52:51.950
All right. I see how it is.

52:54.720 --> 52:56.199
My dad was military.

52:57.640 --> 52:58.640
Really?

52:59.200 --> 53:00.553
Never met him.

53:01.480 --> 53:03.550
He left before I was born.

53:04.800 --> 53:06.472
Where was he stationed?

53:07.160 --> 53:09.230
Around D.C., I guess.

53:10.400 --> 53:11.879
What was his name?

53:14.480 --> 53:16.471
Candy won't talk about him.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.152
- Candy? Oh.
- My mom.

53:19.240 --> 53:22.391
Just says he was a big hero
and a total asshole.

53:24.800 --> 53:25.936
We're beginning our descent,

53:25.960 --> 53:27.936
so if you need to stretch your
legs or use the lavatories,

53:27.960 --> 53:29.393
you should do it now.

53:39.680 --> 53:41.113
I'll be right back.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.638
It's the haircut.

54:02.760 --> 54:05.354
All you contractors
go to the same barber?

54:20.240 --> 54:21.639
Check it.

54:51.800 --> 54:53.597
Oh, he's not feeling well.

54:53.680 --> 54:55.113
You might want to use this one.

55:09.600 --> 55:10.600
Go.

55:11.240 --> 55:13.276
Took two more of your pieces
off the board.

55:16.600 --> 55:18.113
They were the B team.

55:18.440 --> 55:20.715
What were you? JSOC? SEAL Team?

55:21.240 --> 55:23.549
- Something like that.
- When'd you get back?

55:25.600 --> 55:27.556
I'm not sure I ever did.

55:28.080 --> 55:29.274
Don't you miss it?

55:30.240 --> 55:31.389
Not a bit.

55:31.760 --> 55:33.398
I think you do, drifter.

55:34.800 --> 55:39.078
People like us,
we can never go back to the world.

55:39.640 --> 55:41.437
We hurt people.

55:41.960 --> 55:44.235
And the people around us get hurt.

55:44.640 --> 55:46.312
Leave Turner to me.

55:46.640 --> 55:49.632
Walk away now and I won't
hurt the little girl.

55:52.080 --> 55:53.433
You coming to New Orleans?

55:53.800 --> 55:55.472
I'm thinking about it.

55:56.840 --> 55:58.114
Look me up.

55:58.440 --> 55:59.475
I will.

56:02.440 --> 56:04.749
Stairs. Go, go, go.

56:12.480 --> 56:14.152
Go! Go!

56:39.320 --> 56:40.320
Go.

56:40.360 --> 56:41.395
Go. Go.

56:49.200 --> 56:50.349
Wait, wait, wait!

57:09.720 --> 57:11.756
Welcome to Louis Armstrong

57:11.840 --> 57:14.229
New Orleans International Airport.

57:20.880 --> 57:23.838
Now, you're gonna tell me
what's going on,

57:23.960 --> 57:25.996
or the first chance I get,
I'm gonna scream

57:26.080 --> 57:27.274
or grab a policeman.

57:29.880 --> 57:32.235
- Okay, look...
- We're protecting you.

57:32.920 --> 57:35.150
- I found out that some...
- Look, you don't...

57:35.240 --> 57:36.798
- Can you stop?
- Just...

57:36.880 --> 57:38.791
Some people were stealing
from the government.

57:38.880 --> 57:39.915
Stealing what?

57:40.120 --> 57:42.634
At this point,
the less you know, the better.

57:43.040 --> 57:45.600
Bullshit! I got us the credit card, okay?

57:45.800 --> 57:47.870
We wouldn't have gotten
on that plane without it.

57:48.080 --> 57:49.479
They're after me, too.

57:54.280 --> 57:55.599
Why?

57:57.040 --> 57:58.837
You need to tell her.

58:09.760 --> 58:11.432
They think you're my daughter.

58:18.400 --> 58:19.594
That's funny?

58:20.600 --> 58:22.397
You're not my father.

58:22.640 --> 58:23.755
How do you know?

58:26.800 --> 58:29.030
Well, why would you think you are?

58:29.120 --> 58:30.760
Because your mother
filed a paternity suit

58:30.800 --> 58:32.358
with the Army claiming I was.

58:50.160 --> 58:52.879
All we have available
is a lovely two-bedroom suite,

58:52.960 --> 58:55.235
$350 a night. Will that do?

58:55.320 --> 58:57.311
Yes. Can I pay in cash?

59:00.640 --> 59:03.108
So, we gonna take a DNA test?

59:05.440 --> 59:07.112
Little busy right now.

59:08.280 --> 59:09.952
I got to tell you something.

59:12.120 --> 59:13.792
You're gonna get angry.

59:17.560 --> 59:19.471
This whole thing is my fault.

59:22.480 --> 59:23.480
How's that?

59:24.960 --> 59:27.997
I was the one who made her
file the paternity thing.

59:28.480 --> 59:30.948
I thought maybe
she could get something out of it.

59:31.040 --> 59:32.040
Money.

59:33.160 --> 59:34.798
Child support.

59:34.880 --> 59:36.836
Help her get her life together.

59:39.160 --> 59:41.435
She's doing better since she got out.

59:42.720 --> 59:44.153
Got a job.

59:46.320 --> 59:48.197
Maybe she could get a little house.

59:55.840 --> 59:57.068
You're mad.

59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.510
I can see it in your face.

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.908
I'm not mad.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.509
Yes, you are. They think I'm your kid,

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.200
so you have to worry about
protecting me.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:10.840
Yeah.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.275
So?

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.668
So I don't want to be here.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.720
So you don't want me here.
So I should just leave.

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.035
Okay.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.913
Where you gonna go?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.309
I got, uh, food.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.312
- Oh, God!
- Thanks.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.709
- I'm starving. Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.034
She's out.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.513
Our dinner date.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.191
Champagne is still chilling.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.350
I knew you were the romantic type.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.594
So, Reacher, after those phone calls,

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.757
what exactly
did you think would happen?

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.350
I thought a nice dinner,
maybe some wine.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.554
And after dinner?

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.630
Back to your place, maybe.

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.675
As opposed to your seedy motel?

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:02.151
Never underestimate the charm
of a seedy motel.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.511
I can see the appeal.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.997
What do you say
we look for a seedy motel

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.519
once I find Prudhomme?

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.313
I'll go with you.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.838
Only one of us should go.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.874
So I'll go.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.631
No, someone needs to stay here
with her.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.432
What, because I'm a woman
I should be the babysitter?

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.911
I don't know how to be the babysitter.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.832
- You think that I do?
- Yes.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.360
You know, I've had to
put up with this crap

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:36.515
my entire career.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.795
Forget the dickheads
who think that they can paw me,

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.456
- it's every male officer...
- Hey, hey, excuse me.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:41.976
...who thinks that he's smarter
and tougher...

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.433
You've been relieved of command.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.736
I am the commanding officer here!

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.400
You are a fugitive from military justice.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:47.480
So are you!

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.232
So we're both criminals.

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.113
I'm going.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.231
That's a bad idea, Major.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.557
Thank you.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.548
Mrs. Prudhomme?

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.592
Look, I told you people
I don't know where he is, okay?

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.589
Mrs. Prudhomme, I'm an MP.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:31.436
- He's done with all of that.
- It's for his own protection.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.191
He needs my help.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.519
Yeah, well,

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:41.032
he needs all the help he can get,
that's for damn sure.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:42.873
Does he have any friends?

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.280
Places?

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.272
Places he hangs out.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.511
Any place there's dope is where.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:53.833
You have a photo?

01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.235
Yeah.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.314
You can burn it for all I care.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.271
Good evening.

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.591
You followed me in here.

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:34.878
That was a mistake.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.830
And you didn't think
we were watching the wife.

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.796
That was a mistake.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.400
Maybe.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.639
So how do you want to do this?

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.037
How about one at a time?
I get a baseball bat.

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.314
Where's Turner?

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.438
Really?

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.233
If you were gonna kill me,
you would have done it by now.

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.038
Oh, we're not gonna kill you.

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:06.793
Not until you beg for it.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.871
And you're gonna beg.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.391
Left or right?

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.471
Turner's gonna call me in two minutes.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:21.670
If I don't answer, if I don't pick up,
if I sound distressed,

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:23.113
she's in the wind.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.639
You're bluffing.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.559
Go for it.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.056
And now you're wondering
how you're gonna make me talk

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.752
without tipping her off.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.478
You can't torture me.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.239
You can't kill me.

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.229
And you're definitely
gonna have to kill me.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.309
Give me the phone.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.960
Wait.

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.554
Toss it over.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.479
Fellas?

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:37.714
I told you people,
I don't like being followed.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.392
You're good, Jack!

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.671
Killing you
isn't gonna be enough, though.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.456
So I'm gonna take back
my promise about

01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:58.879
not hurting the little girl.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.519
It's never gonna happen.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.270
Sure it is. One day,

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.552
she'll be walking home from school

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.551
or she'll be out on a date

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:12.394
or hanging out with her friends.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:18.475
And you won't be there to protect her.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.095
Okay, so let's try it again.

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:39.935
This time I want you to take the gun
and hold it lower on your chest, okay?

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.095
You're holding it a bit too high.

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.348
- Okay.
- So grab it.

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:43.696
Yeah, bring it low. That's right.

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.038
Now step out and rotate.

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:47.191
- Nice. Good.
- Yeah?

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.950
Hi, Reacher. Check this out.

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.872
- Ready?
- Yep.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.434
Grab.

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:57.879
- Good. Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah?

01:08:58.479 --> 01:08:59.799
What do you think?

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:03.558
Well, trust me,
if all you have left is that move,

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.920
just assume you're dead already.

01:09:08.479 --> 01:09:09.515
That was good.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.796
Let's try again. We're gonna add
a kick to the balls into it, okay?

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.975
Welcome to New Orleans, Captain.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.069
I'm Lieutenant Decoudreau.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.639
We're here to help any way we can.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:17.948
What do you have for me?

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.917
Guys on the plane were ex-military.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.479
Beat up pretty bad.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:22.816
Do we know who they're working for?

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.033
Claim to be unemployed.

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.908
Yeah, right.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.197
I want their bank records,
service records, foreign travel,

01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:31.111
gun registration, car registration,

01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:33.536
how they like their eggs,
their favorite flavor of ice cream.

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:34.560
And I want it yesterday.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:35.600
Sir, yes, sir.

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.393
Is she asleep?

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.071
I spoke to Prudhomme's wife.

01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.076
Turns out he's a junkie.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.911
She didn't know where he was.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.831
But she gave me a photo.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.558
Are you more upset that
I treated you like a woman

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.471
or that I treated you like a man?

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.109
I'm upset that I didn't deck you.

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:25.640
I should have been the one
to go talk to her.

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.756
I can handle myself.
I would've done better.

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:28.840
Maybe.

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:31.839
Appreciate the apology.

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:36.193
Is it really so important that
you make every decision?

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:37.759
Oh, God, you're such a dick.

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.035
You know...

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.399
Okay, I...

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.074
I'm used to working alone.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.872
I'm used to being alone.

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.080
Obviously.

01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:57.912
I'm trying to apologize.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Go on.

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.592
What do you think we should do?

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.834
- Don't patronize me, okay?
- I'm asking your opinion.

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.713
Well, we could go to the V.A.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.576
Which is the first place
Parasource will look.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:13.736
How about the local MPs then?

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.040
Who'll arrest us in a heartbeat.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.952
Okay, what is your plan then, Reacher?

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.831
See, you don't know what to do.

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:21.880
You're like something feral.

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.679
You've got their scent in your nose
and all you want is blood.

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.031
You still don't get it, do you?

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:32.230
They killed my men,
took away my job, my life!

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:36.717
I don't want them as bad as you,
I want them more.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.752
Could you go see if she's up?

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.957
We should get some breakfast,
figure out our next move.

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:21.512
- What do we do with the kid?
- The kid has a name.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.159
I know that.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.158
Why are you so tough on her?

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.679
It's a hard world.

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.872
The sooner she knows it, the better.

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.116
You don't think she knows that already?

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.550
Reacher, what if she is yours?

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.193
Then I should have been there
15 years ago.

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:56.720
Sam?

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.513
Nah, she's not here.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.238
- I'll go get dressed.
- And go where?

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:04.919
Did she say anything to you?

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:06.919
She said she should leave.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.509
What's up?

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.592
- Where were you?
- Out.

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:18.680
Are you crazy?

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:21.115
- I was trying to help.
- How were you gonna help, huh?

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:22.680
You guys said Prudhomme's a junkie.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.720
- We never told you...
- I heard you guys talking.

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.576
Some dude on the street
said there's a place

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.511
in the Ninth Ward
where homeless vets hang out.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.350
Some old warehouse.

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.272
People talk to me. It's a thing.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.096
Do you have any idea
how dangerous that was?

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.872
I told you I can take care of myself.

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.270
Fifteen years old, people are
looking for you, okay.

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.256
When things get hairy,
I just pick out the alpha guy.

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:42.376
And what, he's supposed to protect you?

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.118
No, I give him shit.

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:47.393
Strong guys don't hurt you.
The weak guys do that.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.950
Strong guys always have little sisters.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.276
Or they want one.

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.316
I don't know why, that's just how it is.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.677
I'm really tired.

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.073
I can't do this.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:20.079
That was really stupid.

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:21.720
I know.

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:25.070
Please don't ever do that again.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.149
You're welcome.

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:55.640
Hey.

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.672
Let's go find Prudhomme.

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:09.799
Excuse me, sir.
Can you look at this picture, please?

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:13.515
Well, folks call it the
ninth circle of hell.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.114
If he's a vet, that's where he's gonna be.

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.240
Thank you.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.199
I have money

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:50.671
for Daniel Prudhomme!

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:54.079
How much?

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.199
More than he needs.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.839
Well, how much?

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.639
You know Prudhomme?

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:03.154
It depends.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.113
It's a simple question.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.112
What do you want with him?

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:10.712
I told you.
I want to give him money.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:15.312
You are
Daniel Prudhomme, right?

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.559
Specialist Daniel Prudhomme.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.872
Yes, ma'am.

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:27.793
You worked for Parasource.

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.631
Now, you spoke to two MPs.

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.791
Sergeants Mirkovich and Cibelli.

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:38.999
They interviewed you in Bagram.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.352
No. No, I never heard of them.

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:49.315
Sergeants Mirkovich and Cibelli.

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.550
Mirkovich had a six-year-old daughter.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.756
Cibelli's wife is pregnant
with their first.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:57.997
Now, you're gonna tell me
what happened!

01:16:58.320 --> 01:16:59.548
They'll kill me.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:01.959
She'll kill you.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.879
Now, we'll protect you.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.791
But you have to tell us all of it.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.874
Parasource was running
truck convoys out of Bagram.

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.750
We just ran security for the base.

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:19.991
All I had to do was just lie and say
all the weapons were all accounted for.

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:23.512
They gave me a shitload of money
to keep my mouth shut.

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.397
We're leavi ng enough shit
over there now

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:27.754
to start another war.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.192
Parasource was selling off the weapons

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.748
instead of bringing them
back to the States.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.709
What went wrong?

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:40.192
Warlords want to renegotiate.
Parasource says no.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:44.353
Next day, we're driving
through those poppy fields.

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:46.635
The whole convoy just gets lit up.

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.270
I was scared shitless.

01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.872
Army had to send in
a Search and Rescue.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:02.873
Three Search and Rescue dudes
get wasted on the way.

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:06.958
Two of the dudes I knew, man.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.115
What happened
after you gave your statement?

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:18.995
Nothing. I told them everything.

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:23.150
There was this guy.
He worked for Parasource.

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:27.553
He told me not to worry,
that he'd take care of everything.

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:31.195
Next thing I know,
I hear they've been killed.

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:37.434
I went AWOL.

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:39.511
I h itched a ride back to the States.

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:44.590
I was a dead man if I stayed.

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.035
I, uh...

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.475
I started shooting up over there.

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:55.592
I figured if I'd just
get myself home, you know, I...

01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:58.476
I'd get myself right.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.679
But you didn't.

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.033
No.

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:08.432
More shit on the streets of New Orleans

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:11.034
than they're making in Afghanistan.

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.678
Something's wrong.

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.589
- The numbers don't add up.
- What do you mean?

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.716
Why put huge government
contracts at risk

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:21.519
while selling U.S. Army weapons
on the black market?

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.159
Parasource is smarter than that.

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:26.077
Yeah, they're smart all right.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.518
What about on our end?

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.830
Didn't anybody check to see
the crates were empty?

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.679
Probably some dumb guy like me.

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.869
We need to get inside
one of those transports.

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.189
Um...

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:43.235
Plane leaves Bagram
every Friday at 0600 hours.

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:45.233
Six hours to Frankfurt.

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:48.074
Rest, refuel, eleven more to get home.

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.832
Jesus, that's 10:00 tonight.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.961
And that was without the hot sauce.

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.591
Now, you gotta tell me
that was worth it, sir.

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:17.274
Hey, hey, where you at, chief?

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:20.279
- Ooh, you know, you one fine muffaletta!
- No, no, no.

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:21.696
- No, thank you, ma'am. I'm good.
- Wait a minute.

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.256
Now, don't go depriving
a poor girl a taste now.

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:24.696
I have no money.
I don't need your services.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.119
- Not today, darling.
- Okay.

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:28.111
- Well, it's his loss now.
- Go on now.

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.588
All right.

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.634
- Do I have my wallet?
- Yeah, I think you're good.

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.278
All right, I got my wallet.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:40.475
- You do it?
- Just like we negotiated.

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.552
- Well?
- It's done.

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:50.988
Make the call.

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.717
Is that you?

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.080
No, sir, it's not me.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.280
Who is this?

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:11.756
I have a witness who can exonerate me.

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.559
But he has to live first.

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.069
Why don't you, uh...

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.840
Why don't you come in?
We'll talk about it.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.274
Will you guarantee his safety?

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.316
You're not in charge anymore, Major.

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:21.908
Neither are you, apparently.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.309
Operatives have been
ahead of you this whole time.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.352
Who were those guys
on the plane, hmm?

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.112
Who tried to kill me in my cell?

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:31.234
Here's a name for you. Parasource.

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:33.751
Here's a couple more names
to think about...

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:35.910
Baghdad. Basra.

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:38.191
It's not our first rodeo, is it, Captain?

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.636
You think I want to be
in this position, ma'am?

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.836
I have a job to do, and I'm gonna do it.

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:44.616
I'm gonna take a leap of faith
that you don't have

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:46.119
anything to do with this.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.856
Look on the back of the phone.
Come alone

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.598
and make sure you're not tailed.

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.256
Decoudreau to Espin.

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.713
Decoudreau to Espin.

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.358
This is Espin. Go.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.216
We ID'ed those boys on the plane.

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:08.800
Paid by a shell company
out of the Cayman Islands.

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:12.350
We traced the bank accounts back to
a big military contractor, name of...

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:13.799
Parasource.

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:16.395
Yeah. How'd you know that?

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:17.914
Never mind. Uh...

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.496
Give me everything
you can on Parasource,

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:20.714
and I mean everything.

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:23.230
Look, I'm en route to pick up a witness.

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.589
We'll send backup.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.399
No, stand ready two minutes out.

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:27.629
Wait for my signal.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.920
That's not procedure, sir.

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:32.151
No, that's called an order.

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:35.038
Reacher knows the game.
If he smells heat, he'll bolt.

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.176
All right, we'll stay two minutes out.

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.838
What's the address?

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:41.593
Nicholls Street Wharf. Espin out.

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.030
Nicholls Street Wharf.

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:46.040
No witnesses.

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.400
Freeze!

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:39.714
Don't shoot! Don't shoot, man!

01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:42.241
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.
I'm here to help.

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:45.836
- You're the witness?
- Yeah. Yes, yeah, I'm the witness.

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:51.153
Where the hell are you?

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.356
- You got what you need?
- Not good enough.

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:55.590
I suggest you listen
to what he has to say.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.798
- I can help.
- Okay. Let's go.

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:03.477
I like stories. Tell me a story.

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:10.311
Now we return to
our Halloween marathon.

01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.990
Is your costume ready
for tonight's parade?

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:04.512
- I'm gonna call this in.
- I'll cover.

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:09.996
Officer down, Nicholls Wharf.

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:28.714
I'm out.

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:19.753
You're still wanted for murder.

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.389
That's right.

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:25.355
I'm a stone killer.
That's why I saved you.

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.116
Did Prudhomme give you his statement?

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:29.668
Most of it.

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:32.271
Cibelli and Mirkovich were your friends.

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:34.040
That's right.

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.952
Parasource ordered their murders.

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.112
They also just tried to kill you.

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.595
They've been providing
insurgents with weapons.

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:44.032
You're gonna need more proof
than the word of a dead junkie.

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:46.191
And you're gonna help us get it.

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:50.794
Here. Put the cuffs on,
take us into custody.

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:54.032
Just get us on the tarmac
of Parasource in one hour.

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.433
I need you to jump to
a conclusion here, soldier.

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:11.037
Yeah. Thanks.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.278
Okay, here's what we got.

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.555
Six months ago, Parasource
loses government contracts

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:17.312
worth over a billion dollars.

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.630
They're bleeding cash
and the banks want blood.

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:22.473
But now, all of a sudden,
they start paying back their creditors.

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.638
How much money
can they be really making

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.552
selling weapons on the black market?

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:28.676
An M4 is, what, five grand?

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:30.831
A rocket launcher's half that.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.594
That's nothing compared to
government contracts.

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:35.830
So where are they
getting the money?

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.230
Guest Services.
How may I help you?

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:43.157
Hi, do you have room service?

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.830
I'm sorry, I see you paid
cash for your room.

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:48.832
I'm afraid we can't provide incidentals
without a credit card.

01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:51.150
U h, yeah, just hold on a second.

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.191
You do understand
that the parade is coming

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:54.395
and it may take a while.

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:57.040
That's fine. I'm so starving.

01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:58.798
Uh... Is Visa okay?

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.320
Sir?

01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:07.790
We got a hit on one of the stolen cards.

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:10.997
Hotel Dauphin. 1018 Royal Street.

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:13.873
It's the girl.

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.872
I warned him.

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:50.360
IDs?

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.154
Captain Anthony Espin,
110th Military Police.

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:55.311
I'm gonna have to call this in.

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:03.896
They're unloading the crates.

01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:05.353
We got to get in there.

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:19.113
What's the drill, Major?

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:22.353
Drill is we enforce the law.

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.032
Seatbelts, please.

01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:36.429
- Turner?
- Major.

01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.310
Stand down!

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:00.720
I will lay you down, soldier boy!

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:02.791
- Get on the ground!
- Don't move!

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.911
- Weapons down!
- Put it down!

01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:14.070
Put 'em down, boys, put 'em down.

01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:15.479
Take 'em down.

01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:17.399
Jeez.

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.150
Back off, son.

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.832
What is going on here?

01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:27.517
You in charge of this operation?

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:30.752
I'm General James Harkness.
I run this company.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.072
We have probable cause
to believe a crime has been committed.

01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:35.989
And you are?

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:39.750
Major Susan Turner.
110th Military Police.

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:44.194
The Major Turner who's wanted
by the MPs for espionage?

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:46.718
You mean these MPs?

01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:50.432
These crates
are supposed to contain weapons

01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.351
belonging to the United States Army.

01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:55.598
In fact, you sold them to insurgents.

01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:57.951
And these are now empty.

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:02.953
Do you know who I am, Major?

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:07.030
Yes, General. I do.

01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:12.396
You're the man responsible
for the deaths of two of my men.

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:16.038
Now, open up those crates

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:18.554
before I grab you by your hair plugs

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:21.029
and bitch slap that smug look
off of your face.

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:29.917
What does the manifest say is in there?

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:33.514
AT4 rocket launchers, sir.

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:35.908
Open it.

01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:39.909
Open it.

01:31:58.360 --> 01:31:59.509
Open that one.

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:04.749
Open it.

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:07.280
Open it.

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:16.599
Open that one.

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:19.031
I said open up that crate!

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:22.800
Open it.

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:34.033
Lieutenant, do your goddamn job

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:37.032
and place this goddamn woman
under arrest.

01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:04.310
Sorry, Major, you're gonna
need to come with me.

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:13.669
You're right.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.991
The numbers don't add up.

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:23.639
Sir. Sir.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.280
Stop that man.

01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:27.080
- Reacher!
- Stop that man!

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:30.193
Stop him!

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:33.312
Take him down, now!

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:36.509
Deep breath, son.

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:55.713
Pure opium.

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:04.117
Now the numbers add up.

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:13.798
Get him out of here.

01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:27.989
Hello.

01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:30.831
Good evening. I'm looking for a man,

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.514
a woman and a little blonde teenager.

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:34.600
I'm so sorry.

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:36.776
I don't think I can help you
with that type of information.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:40.315
I'm looking for two adults
and a little blonde girl.

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.073
Go find their key.

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:49.936
We have a 4-star
general in custody.

01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.473
And it's at least 500 kilos.

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:55.440
Sam.

01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:57.437
Reacher, it's him. He's here.

01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:59.796
- What?
- At the hotel. Hurry.

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:02.953
Sam, listen to me.

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.276
Sam? Sam?

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:44.838
Wait, excuse me!

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.991
Hey! What are you doing?

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:49.471
Where are you going? Come back here!

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.149
She's not answering.

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:04.520
Try again.

01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:10.789
Car, car, car, car!

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.194
Sam?

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:54.553
She's not in the hotel.

01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:57.069
- She's in the street.
- How do you know?

01:36:58.400 --> 01:36:59.879
Because that's what I would do.

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.233
I'll go this way.

01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:27.029
Did you see anything?

01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:29.016
Searched the whole hotel.
We didn't find a trace of her.

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.320
She's gotta be hiding somewhere.

01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:42.990
Reacher.

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:46.079
Let's finish this. Just you and me.

01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:49.238
I'm gonna have some fun
with your pretty little girl.

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:50.753
She's not my little girl.

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:52.592
Is that fear I hear in your voice, Jack?

01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:55.793
I'm gonna break your arms,
I'm gonna break your legs.

01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:57.239
I'm gonna break your neck.

01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.795
What you hear is excitement.

01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:01.439
Hey, you! Get out of there!

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:03.478
Come on. Right now. Out.

01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.109
Nice try, Jack.

01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:08.279
I've found a way to hurt you
like you've never hurt before.

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:35.840
Samantha!

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:49.157
- Do you have her?
- Chartres Street.

01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:50.349
Lafitte Hotel.

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:25.191
Sam, run! Run!

01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:55.353
Shoot me and I let go!

01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:59.238
Shoot me. Shoot me, Jack.

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:02.398
No? Shoot me!

01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:05.717
Parasource is done.

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:07.877
Harkness is in custody.

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:10.071
Congratulations, Jack.

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:12.031
I really... I don't give a shit.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.870
Shut up. Shut up!

01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:19.198
I told you this would happen.

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:23.233
You said this was about you and me.

01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:25.631
Put the gun down.

01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:31.551
Okay! Okay. Just...

01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:34.720
Okay.

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:38.073
If I put down the gun, you let her go.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.638
My life for hers.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.228
No!

01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:49.079
I like it.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Deal, Jack.

01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:54.149
It's okay, Sam. Look at me.

01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:57.319
It's okay. It's the only way.

01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.593
It's okay.

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:03.271
I'm gonna put the gun down now.

01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:13.918
You know what this means?

01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:18.349
It means we're dead already.

01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:25.429
Over here.

01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:27.599
Kick it over here.

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:09.879
Come on.

01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:28.509
Look at me.

01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:32.039
You look at me.

01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:57.035
Hey.

01:45:57.760 --> 01:45:59.296
- Is he all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:00.753
Reacher, look here.

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:05.039
I'm right here.

01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:15.269
Can you walk?

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:18.069
Sure.

01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:23.119
Get the other side.

01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:30.397
Dude,
you jumped off a building!

01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:31.879
Yeah, I know.

01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:33.632
- Did it hurt?
- Yes.

01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:35.712
Did you see how high that was?

01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:38.519
Can we possibly have this
conversation some other time?

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:21.600
Thank you.

01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:26.033
You know, it's funny.

01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:31.070
You came here looking for one girl
and you ended up with another.

01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:36.072
Let me know how that goes.

01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:41.712
I've still got your number.

01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:48.909
Bye, Reacher.

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:50.320
Major.

01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:13.072
Good to see you back, Major.

01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:15.913
Thank you, Captain.

01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:44.749
Sorry. Bus got stuck in traffic.

01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:48.754
New T-shirt.

01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:50.480
Shut up.

01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:52.953
Thanks for coming.

01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:57.953
So, Reacher,

01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:01.072
are you my father or not?

01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:06.154
I guess we'll see
when your mother gets here.

01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.112
Sure you'd recognize her?

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:12.520
I tend to remember
the women I sleep with.

01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:15.358
But who says she'll remember you?

01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:16.520
Thanks a lot.

01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:24.838
You're not my father.

01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:27.313
Why do you say that?

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.433
See that woman over there?

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:37.630
The waitress who's refilled
your coffee three times?

01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:42.193
That's her.

01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:45.989
Neither of you had any idea
who the other was.

01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:55.834
- I knew it all along.
- No, you didn't.

01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:58.636
I'm sure you're relieved.

01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:02.513
Not really.

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:15.312
You're just gonna go?

01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:18.394
That's right.

01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:23.071
Don't you ever get lonely?

01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:28.349
Sometimes.

01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:34.753
Sometimes.

01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:40.559
You can call me when you do.

01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:57.074
So...

01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:02.434
Shouldn't you be...

01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:07.673
I'd better go.

01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:11.073
Got class.

01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:15.188
Drawing.

01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:24.275
Yeah, well, you keep that up,
because you're really good at it.

01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:29.714
You're really good.

01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:40.758
You're gonna be okay, kid.

01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:50.120
Well...

01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:37.036
See you around, Reacher.
