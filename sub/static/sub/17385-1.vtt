- Okay.

05:30.899 --> 05:33.333

05:33.368 --> 05:35.635

to try to get somebody

18:30.256 --> 18:31.856

18:31.891 --> 18:34.225
In fact, "Action Comics"
number 1, he's on the cover.

18:34.260 --> 18:35.993
He's not on the cover
again till number 7,

18:36.029 --> 18:37.562
'cause they didn't get
the sales reports back,

18:37.597 --> 18:39.397

18:39.432 --> 18:42.366

the rest, they say, is history.

You didn't want to hold it or read it?

19:15.535 --> 19:17.239

19:17.264 --> 19:18.502
Well, I didn't want to touch it.

hands are worthy to hold it,

dig the smell of old comics.
