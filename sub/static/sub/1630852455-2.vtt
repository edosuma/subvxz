00:20.840 --> 00:22.040
She's your sister.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.560
Yeah, but she's been denying it, so…

00:25.800 --> 00:28.560
The bird-box camera from the garden.
Caught in the act.

00:38.840 --> 00:40.720
-Charity conferences.
-I know.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.320
-Mum, is this your hotel?
-Yeah, the Imperial.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.600
-That's it.
-Great.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.120
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.400
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.640
Is that your mum? She looks hot.

01:17.800 --> 01:20.200
-What's she doing here?
-I don't know.

01:37.320 --> 01:41.120
Why would she come here? It's not like
somewhere you just happen to pass.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.240
-She's come here on purpose.
-Dunno.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.920
Hey, it's Carnival next weekend.

01:48.440 --> 01:51.240
There'll be crowds here.
Shall we come back then?

01:51.320 --> 01:52.880
What, and try and get in?

01:52.960 --> 01:55.080
Yeah. See why she'd come here.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.280
How are we gonna get in though?

02:17.360 --> 02:18.440
Wanna join me?

02:20.200 --> 02:21.200
Jump in.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.480
-Yeah, okay.
-Let's go.

02:36.200 --> 02:37.200
Ta-da!

02:37.280 --> 02:39.160
-Beautiful.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.600
Oh, drinks!

03:05.480 --> 03:06.680
Thank you.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.000
-What are you doing?

03:17.320 --> 03:18.240
-All right?
-Mmm.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.280
Two, one!

03:28.880 --> 03:30.080
Mmm.

03:33.040 --> 03:33.880
I need you.

03:35.640 --> 03:36.720
I'll be back.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.120
What are you doing?

03:41.760 --> 03:43.800
-He just spiked your drink.
-No!

03:43.880 --> 03:45.440
Yeah. Look. I tested it.

03:51.680 --> 03:55.080
We've gotta get out of here.
We need, uh, a cab. Where are the cabs?

03:55.600 --> 03:57.240
-I've got his car keys.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.720
He asked me to hold them
while he put his necklace on me.

04:04.760 --> 04:08.080
-Hey! Come back here with my keys.
-Run! Come on!

04:08.160 --> 04:09.120
Come back here!

04:58.840 --> 05:01.000
-So?
-I've got one word for you.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.120
Mmm.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.840
-Barista!
-Ooh!

05:04.920 --> 05:08.880
7:30, already crushin'.
It's gonna be a good day.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.960
-Breakfast on the table!

05:11.040 --> 05:11.880
Laura?

05:11.960 --> 05:15.600
Good girl. Have you charged
your phone? Good girl again.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.440
-Fully charged.
-Sweetest boy. You're good too.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.000
Kayleigh? Let's be having you.
Up and at 'em.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.440
-Where's your phone?

05:25.520 --> 05:29.160
My phone is here. And I'm not in today.
It's home study. I'm doing revision.

05:29.240 --> 05:33.200
Well, up and revise.
"Not in" doesn't mean staying in bed.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.080
Yes, okay.

05:35.960 --> 05:39.440
But, Mum,
Laura's been taking my clothes again.

05:40.200 --> 05:43.640
Can you have a word? 'Cause,
well, this time it was my red dress.

05:45.320 --> 05:46.920
Yeah. I'll talk to her.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.040
He's back. Stewart Green.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.320
Cassie?

06:39.800 --> 06:40.840
Sorry about this.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.720
Good job I never moved.

06:46.480 --> 06:47.840
No coffee, I'm afraid.

06:48.480 --> 06:49.480
Lots of teas.

06:50.640 --> 06:51.520
Or, um…

06:52.760 --> 06:56.720
or I got this, which is disgusting,
but it's good for you.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.880
-There you go.
-Thanks.

07:03.280 --> 07:06.080
Right.
What else can I do you for?

07:07.280 --> 07:08.680
Um…

07:09.200 --> 07:12.400
I need to speak to the person
who claims they saw Stewart Green.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.040
Go on, then.

07:19.680 --> 07:23.040
-Why didn't you say it was you?
-I don't wanna get into Green's sights.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.760
The man scares the shit out of me.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.280
I was in the office one night.

07:29.360 --> 07:33.720
I heard shouting in the bar,
so I went through, and there he was.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.960
Stewart Green, on his way out.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.840
Shaved head, dark suit, white shirt.
It was him.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.280
Anyway, he'd lost it.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.280
And he was yelling,

07:45.360 --> 07:47.000
"I know Cassie's been in."

07:47.520 --> 07:49.800
"I know because she's been seen."

07:51.800 --> 07:52.640
Yeah.

07:53.440 --> 07:57.160
I thought he was talking bollocks,
but then I looked back at the CCTV,

07:58.360 --> 07:59.520
and there you were.

08:02.720 --> 08:06.160
-I only came back the once.
-Yeah, well, once was enough.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.000
It never crossed my mind coming back.
Not for years.

08:09.640 --> 08:11.720
And then suddenly, I was getting married,

08:12.240 --> 08:15.480
and Vipers became like this magnet,
pulling me back.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.800
'Cause I never got to say goodbye.

08:19.720 --> 08:20.600
I just left.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.960
And that's all it was meant to be.
A goodbye.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.160
What have I done?

08:28.760 --> 08:32.320
-I've got a family, Lorraine.
-Hey. Hey, it'll be all right.

08:32.400 --> 08:36.840
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.
It's all right. It's gonna be all right.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.040
-It will.

08:41.680 --> 08:45.600
-You just gotta be careful.
-Yeah, well, I'm discovering that.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.320
I tried to see Harry last night.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.480
But he was out of it.

08:51.120 --> 08:54.160
And there were
these dodgy blokes hanging about.

08:54.240 --> 08:58.000
Yeah, well, the most amazing thing
about Harry is he's still alive.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.640
So he's not working anymore?

09:01.160 --> 09:03.440
No, no, he works full-time.
That's his life.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.960
Shooting up and fighting the good fight.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.960
But he's always there
when the girls need him.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.360
Anyone who says
functioning addicts don't exist

09:11.440 --> 09:13.160
should go and see Harry Sutton.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.240
Okay.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.000
Then I'll try him again.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.200
Oh! Aww.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.160
A Cassie hug.

09:40.640 --> 09:45.360
Uh, cluttered desk, cluttered mind.
And have we found Carlton Flynn yet?

10:17.040 --> 10:18.600
Come on, bloody thing!

10:56.480 --> 10:57.320
Hello, ladies.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.040
Not open. The club's shut.

11:00.120 --> 11:00.960
Police.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.640
Can you put these up around the club?

11:41.840 --> 11:42.920
Thank you.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.040
-Don't… don't touch me.
-All right.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.880
-Don't-- Can I just--
-Just get onto your feet.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.560
-There.
-Hey.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.520
-I've seen--
-Steady.

12:43.360 --> 12:44.880
-I'm not--
-All right.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.680
-Yeah, so?
-Just making sure you're okay.

13:20.920 --> 13:21.960
Simona.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.160
Ray.

13:25.360 --> 13:26.720
Hey!

13:27.240 --> 13:28.800
-Oh!
-Wow!

13:28.880 --> 13:31.000
I know. Getting big.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.720
-When is it due?
-Two weeks.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.080
-Well, you look fantastic.

13:39.200 --> 13:43.080
But it's weird, though, because this,
I know, this is my army sergeant,

13:43.160 --> 13:45.960
but this… 
…this just won't compute yet!

13:46.040 --> 13:48.960
Well, don't worry,
it's only a phase. It'll pass.

13:49.040 --> 13:52.280
Want a cuppa?
Oh, no, wait. I've got something for you.

13:52.360 --> 13:56.440
I've been meaning to give you one of these
for ages. Where are they? Where is it?

13:57.040 --> 13:57.880
Yes.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.000
Ta-da!

14:01.280 --> 14:03.000
It's, uh… it's out of print.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.400
-Well, it was hardly ever in print.
-Mm-hmm?

14:06.480 --> 14:08.520
In fact, I'm not sure
anyone actually bought one,

14:08.600 --> 14:11.960
but there's, uh… there's some great shots
of you and the unit.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.840
Look, Basra Palace.

14:14.480 --> 14:15.720
Out on patrol.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.160
Here, from me to you.

14:19.760 --> 14:23.520
For keeping me safe under enemy fire
for more times than I care to remember.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.040
Yeah, you can also use it as a doorstop.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.600
-Right. Tea.
-Oh, no. Ray. Ray…

14:30.240 --> 14:31.080
Um…

14:31.160 --> 14:32.440
Have you seen Guy?

14:33.400 --> 14:35.080
Uh, yeah. Last Friday.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.840
I mean after that.

14:37.920 --> 14:38.760
No.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.000
He hasn't been in touch?

14:43.320 --> 14:46.920
Well, we did Carnival night,
but that was it.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.480
Sorry. Are you saying
you haven't seen him since then?

14:51.240 --> 14:53.800
I haven't seen him, haven't spoken to him.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.560
He's not answering his phone.

14:58.880 --> 15:00.280
Oh, he'll turn up.

15:02.720 --> 15:03.560
Did he…

15:04.240 --> 15:06.560
did he mention the baby
while you were out with him?

15:07.080 --> 15:10.200
Look.
Carnival was pretty messy.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.240
We got obliterated,

15:12.320 --> 15:15.320
but, um, no, we definitely weren't talking
about babies.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.840
I just feel like something's happened.

15:21.640 --> 15:25.120
Like… maybe he's cut and run.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.280
Well, 'cause this is too much.

15:28.840 --> 15:29.680
No.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.080
I'm confused.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.640
All I know is I've gotta find him.

15:37.720 --> 15:41.160
There's still a few more places to try,
so, um, if he calls you…

15:41.240 --> 15:42.080
Yeah, of course.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.960
And if there's anything I can do…

15:46.040 --> 15:46.880
Thanks.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.040
<i>Hi, this is Guy.</i>
<i>After the beep, get busy.</i>

16:12.120 --> 16:13.560
-Guy, it's Ray.

16:14.400 --> 16:18.720
Listen, um… I've just seen Simona,
and she's looking for you, mate,

16:18.800 --> 16:20.920
so give her a call, yeah?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.680
Or give me a call. Just, um…

16:24.200 --> 16:25.280
just get in touch.

16:27.320 --> 16:31.440
Look, I know it got a bit messy
the other night at Vipers.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.440
Just call me.

17:02.280 --> 17:05.280
For example, when you say,
"The bastard bollock-faced

17:05.360 --> 17:06.840
-piece of shit is a twat…"

17:06.920 --> 17:07.880
…I get your gist.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.280
Uh, I should have named the fat fuck.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.560
No… Actually, that wouldn't be bad,

17:12.640 --> 17:15.360
but the point is, couldn't
you word it a little bit differently?

17:15.440 --> 17:17.480
This is going before the magistrates.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.600
In fact, why don't I just work on it
before this afternoon?

17:20.680 --> 17:23.840
-Oh! I bloody love you, Harry Sutton.
-I know you do.

17:24.360 --> 17:27.080
You're on. You do that. See you later.

17:27.160 --> 17:28.240
See ya.

17:38.640 --> 17:39.840
Hello, Harry.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.680
How have you been?

17:45.800 --> 17:46.640
Fine, thanks.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.880
"Fine, thanks"?

17:52.960 --> 17:53.960
Oh, come here.

17:59.560 --> 18:01.880
When you ran off
with Stewart Green,

18:02.760 --> 18:05.320
I thought that was it.
I thought I'd never see you again.

18:05.400 --> 18:08.160
Harry, I didn't run off with him.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.280
-Yes.
-No, I…

18:12.960 --> 18:14.960
I ran away… away from him.

18:15.480 --> 18:18.080
You both left at the same time.
You were seeing him.

18:18.160 --> 18:20.360
Harry, the man was a psychopath.

18:20.440 --> 18:22.000
I had to get out of there.

18:22.080 --> 18:26.160
The only way I could make that happen was
to vanish without a trace, to disappear.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.640
So he could never find me again.

18:29.200 --> 18:32.360
I thought I was in control.
I thought I could handle him.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
And then suddenly,
everything just… got way too scary.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.800
But evidently, you're doing okay.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.400
I'm not looking at a pole dancer
anymore, am I?

18:45.080 --> 18:45.960
No.

18:46.840 --> 18:48.680
And you work in a pet shop now?

18:49.280 --> 18:51.400
Yes, well, I've been meaning
to redecorate.

18:51.480 --> 18:53.440
-Just haven't got round to it.

18:55.040 --> 18:58.320
What is all this about anyway?
I mean, why turn up now?

18:58.400 --> 19:01.240
Because Stewart Green is back,
and he's looking for me.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.280
Back why?

19:03.360 --> 19:06.120
I've no idea. I thought
you would have known something.

19:06.640 --> 19:10.240
Seventeen years ago,
he absconded with a boatload of money.

19:10.320 --> 19:13.720
There was a question of fraud.
That is all I know.

19:14.480 --> 19:17.520
I went to his old house yesterday.
His wife's house.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.600
It's up for sale, so I posed as a buyer.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.600
I wasn't there for long.
I blew it. She got suspicious.

19:23.680 --> 19:27.280
But I had this feeling
that Green was there.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.040
I heard something in the basement.

19:30.720 --> 19:33.560
His wife totally ignored it,
but I heard it.

19:33.640 --> 19:37.880
Well, getting in the basement
will settle this problem,

19:37.960 --> 19:39.480
and this'll get us in there.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
But it still brings us back
to the question, why is he back now?

19:43.080 --> 19:46.080
Maybe he's run out of money,
so he gets his wife to sell the house.

19:46.160 --> 19:49.680
I don't know.
But what I need to nail is, is he back?

19:51.880 --> 19:54.760
Because if he is, Harry,
I've got a big fucking problem.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.920
-<i>Mrs. Sarah Green?</i>
<i>-Uh… yeah.</i>

20:12.000 --> 20:13.920
<i>Good morning.</i>
<i>I'm so sorry to bother you.</i>

20:14.000 --> 20:18.240
<i>I am doing conveyancing for one</i>
<i>of the prospective buyers for the house.</i>

20:18.840 --> 20:21.600
But there's been a report
you had structural work done on your roof

20:21.680 --> 20:24.440
without planning permission
about 11 years ago,

20:24.520 --> 20:27.120
which could affect
the sale of the property.

20:27.200 --> 20:31.280
Um… no, no, I haven't, uh… I haven't
had any work done. Who's reporting that?

20:31.360 --> 20:32.960
We're not allowed to disclose that,

20:33.040 --> 20:35.000
but I can't see any structural work

20:35.080 --> 20:37.840
down here from the front elevation
or from the side.

20:37.920 --> 20:40.280
There's no reason
for me to come into the house,

20:40.360 --> 20:42.720
but if I could just check
the side and back, we can be done.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.120
<i>-Right…</i>
-<i> This can be done--</i>

20:48.440 --> 20:51.120
…wrong address, and it's structural work
on some other house?

20:51.200 --> 20:53.920
-Yeah.
-You've got the grass all the way round.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.760
I love this. This is great.
I'm thinking about…

20:57.280 --> 20:59.120
I think it is just…

20:59.200 --> 21:01.560
…there of someone
who's got the wrong address.

21:01.640 --> 21:03.640
I mean, I've seen where it's happened…

22:32.920 --> 22:35.040
<i>Yes, thank you. Thanks very much.</i>

22:55.680 --> 22:57.200
Did you get into the basement?

22:57.880 --> 22:58.880
-Yeah.
And?

22:59.680 --> 23:03.280
There's an old bunker down there
with a heavy door.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.560
Like, big enough
for someone to get inside.

23:06.080 --> 23:09.240
There are also some old Vipers flyers,
which creeped me out.

23:09.760 --> 23:10.760
What are you doing?

23:10.840 --> 23:13.760
The house is for sale,
so let's look at the details again.

23:14.600 --> 23:20.080
When I was a kid, houses of that age
had an air raid shelter in the basement.

23:21.520 --> 23:22.600
No, nothing.

23:24.600 --> 23:26.480
Let's see some photos of your kids, then.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.400
The car is screaming "family."

23:31.600 --> 23:32.440
Okay.

23:35.000 --> 23:35.920
Um…

23:37.520 --> 23:39.520
This is Jordan. He's 11. Um…

23:40.400 --> 23:42.280
-This is Dave.
-He looks nice.

23:42.800 --> 23:43.640
Yeah, he is.

23:44.760 --> 23:49.080
And these two are Laura and Kayleigh.

23:50.160 --> 23:51.200
Cute.

23:51.800 --> 23:52.720
Um…

23:52.800 --> 23:55.280
Oh, God, I've got to be in court
in an hour.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.200
-I'll… I'll drop you.
-Thank you.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.720
Once you drop me, will you stick around?

23:59.800 --> 24:01.720
There's someone
who may be able to help you.

24:03.400 --> 24:07.400
-I want you to meet this policeman I know.
-I'm not talking to the police.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.440
His name is Mike Broome.
He's one of the good guys.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.240
I'm sure he is, but he's gonna ask me
questions that I can't answer.

24:12.320 --> 24:17.040
-Well, talk to him off the record, then.
-No! Harry, I cannot talk to the police.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.520
You're gonna keep
you and your family safe how?

24:19.600 --> 24:20.640
I don't know yet.

24:21.800 --> 24:22.640
But I will.

24:23.160 --> 24:24.120
I have to.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.120
You know what's wrong
with this new office?

24:27.200 --> 24:28.600
Well, one of the many things.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.280
There's no smell.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.920
It smells of absolutely nothing.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.400
-I like it.
-You like it?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.880
-This building's great for me.
-Why?

24:38.320 --> 24:41.920
-Oh yeah, of course.
-Okay. Can I have everyone's attention?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.280
Great. Thank you. Uh, everyone's, yeah?

24:44.920 --> 24:48.080
All right, today's focus is Carlton Flynn

24:48.160 --> 24:50.720
and, in particular, finding his car.

24:51.320 --> 24:54.400
All right, let's go, and let's get
the public helping us, yeah?

24:54.480 --> 24:58.760
-And let's get another press release out…
-I just need the footage from the 16th.

25:00.680 --> 25:01.600
It's all been wiped.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.120
-Really?

25:05.640 --> 25:06.520
Hello?

25:06.600 --> 25:08.800
<i>Where's my fucking recorder?</i>

25:08.880 --> 25:10.840
Rudy. I thought I'd service it for you.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.640
<i>Just give it the fuck back.</i>

25:12.720 --> 25:14.440
And I am cooperatin'.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.360
Once this is done, just leave me alone.

25:17.440 --> 25:18.520
Once what's done?

25:18.600 --> 25:22.080
One of our dancers, Tawny Allure,

25:22.160 --> 25:24.480
goes out with that young lad
who's gone missing.

25:24.560 --> 25:25.840
She wants to see ya.

25:25.920 --> 25:26.800
Toni who?

25:26.880 --> 25:30.760
Not Toni. Tawny. Like the color.

25:30.840 --> 25:32.560
And Allure, like…

25:33.680 --> 25:35.080
like fucking "allure"!

25:35.160 --> 25:37.600
-Coming now.
-Making progress? Name a card.

25:37.680 --> 25:38.680
-Erin.

25:38.760 --> 25:41.200
Hi. I've just parked up,
but listen, I've--

25:41.280 --> 25:43.440
<i> No, stay in the car.</i>
<i>We've got somewhere to go.</i>

25:43.520 --> 25:46.720
Carlton Flynn was apparently seeing
one of the dancers at Vipers.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.640
Tawny Allure. She wants to talk with us.

25:48.720 --> 25:51.480
Great. Good. Yeah, I like it. Go.

25:51.560 --> 25:55.320
Uh, but first, excuse me,
uh, name that card.

25:56.160 --> 25:57.280
Seven of clubs?

26:00.560 --> 26:02.360
Yes!

26:02.920 --> 26:06.480
Okay, right, let's get some news
on Carlton Flynn's car.

26:06.560 --> 26:08.400
It's hardly a shrinking violet.

26:13.760 --> 26:15.880
-We have a development.
-Well, I have--

26:15.960 --> 26:17.880
-Drive. We're going to Vipers.
-Yeah…

26:17.960 --> 26:21.440
Carlton Flynn has been having this thing
with one of the dancers from the club.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.480
-Come on.

26:22.560 --> 26:25.520
Like Stewart Green had with Cassie.
I'm not assuming there's any connections.

26:25.600 --> 26:26.640
Just saying there could be.

26:26.720 --> 26:29.680
To make sure I don't twist things
to fit what I want, you'll be there--

26:29.760 --> 26:31.160
Mama.

26:32.920 --> 26:35.160
Yeah. Got some childcare issues.

26:51.480 --> 26:52.960
-You're in the police force.

26:53.040 --> 26:54.360
Yeah, and I'm also a mother.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.920
-When you come to work--

26:56.000 --> 26:57.560
You wanted me to check CCTV.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.320
Of all the jobs,
you don't bring your child!

26:59.400 --> 27:02.520
-I thought I'd take it home and do it.
-I would have liked you in this interview.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.840
If you'd said that was what you wanted,
I would have made other--

27:05.920 --> 27:09.360
Oh my God! Don't give him that.
What's the matter with you?

27:09.440 --> 27:11.520
I'm sorry I left my finger puppets
back at the station.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.840
-Great dad you'd have made.

27:22.040 --> 27:22.880
Hello?

27:25.960 --> 27:26.800
Hello.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.280
Well, well, well.

27:31.360 --> 27:32.320
Sweet Lorraine.

27:32.840 --> 27:34.920
My favorite detective.

27:35.880 --> 27:38.000
Come on. Tawny's through here.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.240
Is Rudy joining us?

27:40.320 --> 27:43.520
No, sorry. He can't show his face
until the sun sets.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.040
Here we go. Tawny?

27:47.560 --> 27:48.760
This is Mike Broome.

27:52.800 --> 27:53.640
Hi.

27:55.360 --> 27:58.840
Rudy said you wanted to see me.
Do you know where Carlton Flynn is?

27:58.920 --> 28:00.920
No. I don't.

28:02.600 --> 28:03.440
Right.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.960
But you go out with him, yeah?

28:07.040 --> 28:10.120
No. I have danced for him here,

28:10.200 --> 28:15.120
but… I don't do extras
for customers or see them outside.

28:16.400 --> 28:21.000
Except… I'm leaving
to train as a nurse next month,

28:21.080 --> 28:23.520
so I'm saving up.

28:25.040 --> 28:27.320
And one night, after work,

28:28.200 --> 28:30.120
Carlton's waiting outside in his car,

28:31.120 --> 28:32.600
waving a fistful of cash,

28:33.400 --> 28:35.400
offering the lot for a private show.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.320
-Oh, Tawny.
-I know.

28:39.520 --> 28:42.880
Anyway, we drive
to a headland up the coast.

28:44.840 --> 28:47.920
He puts music on,
and we get out of the car.

28:48.520 --> 28:51.360
And I'm wearing what I'm wearing there.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.200
Pretty soon,
he's trying to put money down the top

28:57.280 --> 28:59.840
so that he can touch, which isn't allowed.

29:00.440 --> 29:03.880
But when I tell him that,
he grabs my wrist and…

29:05.480 --> 29:06.760
Oh my God.

29:07.560 --> 29:10.160
He bends both fingers back
till they break.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.560
When was this?

29:12.440 --> 29:13.800
The day before Carnival.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.120
That's why I haven't been in.

29:16.920 --> 29:19.760
-She said she had a cold.
-Have you seen Carlton Flynn since?

29:19.840 --> 29:22.960
No. I don't want to press charges.

29:23.560 --> 29:26.120
I just didn't want you thinking
I was running.

29:26.680 --> 29:29.520
'Cause before you train to be a nurse,
they run checks on you.

29:30.320 --> 29:34.840
If you have any cautions or convictions,
they bar you, and you can't be a nurse.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.200
Tawny, I understand.

29:38.520 --> 29:39.360
It's okay.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.760
Thanks for coming forward.

29:47.280 --> 29:49.880
You, uh… you didn't bring
the recorder back, did you?

29:50.960 --> 29:52.040
I'll send it over.

29:53.240 --> 29:55.120
-Oh, um…

29:55.200 --> 29:56.800
My number, in case you need it.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.840
I know how to call the police.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.200
Wanna give me yours?

30:07.680 --> 30:09.040
I'm not that easy anymore.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.680
-Hi. Hello.
-Hello. Hi.

30:32.760 --> 30:35.640
-We've got some really good news.
-Some good news just for you.

30:35.720 --> 30:37.720
We won't take
too much of your time.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.480
You could be
one of our lucky winners.

30:39.560 --> 30:41.880
That's very kind,
but I don't want to waste your time.

30:41.960 --> 30:43.600
Oh, you won't be doing that.

30:43.680 --> 30:46.960
But I'm moving out today,
and I'm in a bit of a rush.

30:47.040 --> 30:50.200
Oh! Okay. Well, can I just give you
something, then?

30:56.080 --> 30:59.080
Everything you know
about Carlton Flynn.

31:08.160 --> 31:11.560
That boy we were with at the Carnival,
he's on the news. Look!

31:11.640 --> 31:13.400
He's missing. Look, it's him!

31:16.120 --> 31:18.080
-Carlton. Was that his name?
-Dunno. Must be.

31:18.160 --> 31:21.320
But look, missing since the Carnival.

31:21.400 --> 31:23.280
And I swapped those cocktails.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.200
Come back here!

31:27.920 --> 31:30.880
He was off his face in the woods.
What if he's unconscious somewhere?

31:30.960 --> 31:33.040
What if
he fell down one of the big drops?

31:33.120 --> 31:36.360
-We've got to go and see. I'll drive us.
-What? Now? No, he's fine.

31:36.440 --> 31:38.960
You didn't swap those drinks.
We're going. Come on.

31:51.840 --> 31:53.680
Okay, here's how it goes.

31:53.760 --> 31:56.520
We need to know where Carlton Flynn is.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.280
-Aha.

31:59.760 --> 32:03.800
I understand.
You need a little… persuasion.

32:16.320 --> 32:18.400
Actually, would you mind?

32:18.480 --> 32:19.560
Thank you.

32:20.160 --> 32:24.080
I think, first of all, we need…

32:31.720 --> 32:35.800
I mean, if someone has an accident
because of something you've done,

32:35.880 --> 32:38.080
what does that make you guilty of?

32:40.120 --> 32:42.520
-Hi, Mum.
-Hiya. Have you got Jordan with you?

32:42.600 --> 32:43.440
His phone's off.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.520
-No.
-<i> Oh. Okay.</i>

32:45.600 --> 32:47.920
Well, when he gets home,
can you feed him for me?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.160
I'm at Bea's. We're doing past papers.

32:50.240 --> 32:52.040
-Timed, like you said.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.840
-What was that?
-What was what?

32:54.920 --> 32:56.000
<i>The car horn.</i>

32:56.080 --> 32:58.360
You're hearing things, Mum.
Gotta get on. Call Laura. Bye.

33:04.960 --> 33:07.800
-Hello?
-Hiya. Um, are you home yet?

33:07.880 --> 33:09.160
Five minutes away.

33:09.240 --> 33:11.840
Can you feed Jordan for me?
Put him on the phone.

33:11.920 --> 33:13.320
He wasn't on the bus.

33:13.400 --> 33:16.200
<i>Must have got the one before.</i>
<i>He might have fed himself.</i>

33:16.280 --> 33:18.840
Yeah, right.
Just give him a pizza or something.

33:18.920 --> 33:19.840
<i>All right. Bye.</i>

33:21.240 --> 33:22.720
Yeah, that's good.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.600
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.080
Uh, no. I don't know…

33:32.440 --> 33:36.160
Uh, I think not. No.
Thank you. Very nice but not in here.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.680
-I'm just picking something up.
-It's on my desk.

33:38.760 --> 33:42.440
-Erin, got something for you.
-Get anything down at Vipers?

33:42.520 --> 33:45.040
Yeah. The impression
that Carlton Flynn's not very pleasant.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.200
In what way?

33:46.280 --> 33:49.480
He breaks young women's fingers
when they don't do what he wants.

33:50.080 --> 33:53.200
Broome. This man here, Guy Tatum,

33:53.280 --> 33:56.400
has just been reported missing
by Simona Farr, his girlfriend.

33:56.480 --> 33:59.160
Last seen the same night
Carlton Flynn disappeared.

33:59.240 --> 34:01.440
-Same night?
-The 16th.

34:02.200 --> 34:06.120
So two men go missing 17 years to the day
after Stewart Green disappeared.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.320
On that, just take a minute, take a beat,

34:08.400 --> 34:11.400
think to yourself,
"Is it a pattern or just a coincidence?"

34:11.480 --> 34:12.800
Coincidence, my hole.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.040
I want every missing persons file
from the last 17 years.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.120
We've done this before.

34:16.200 --> 34:18.120
Well, let's do it again,
this time with feeling!

34:18.200 --> 34:19.480
What's all the commotion?

34:19.560 --> 34:21.960
-Here, ten minutes. Thank you.
-Whoa--

34:22.040 --> 34:23.320
-Sorry.
-Where are you going?

34:23.400 --> 34:26.280
We're supposed
to be finding Carlton Flynn's car.

34:26.360 --> 34:27.840
His name's Seamus. Sorry.

34:28.640 --> 34:30.360
Okay, Seamus, mate.

34:32.320 --> 34:36.840
Do you like magic? Yeah, course you do.
Here, look, look. There you go.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.160
Pick a card, any card.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.880
-Hiya.
-<i>Mum.</i>

35:08.960 --> 35:13.040
Jordan's not here,
so I called his friend Joey.

35:13.120 --> 35:17.440
<i>And he says he saw him talking to this man</i>
<i>at the skateboard park.</i>

35:17.520 --> 35:21.520
-What are you talking about? What man?
-<i>That's all I know. Where are you?</i>

35:23.200 --> 35:26.000
-I'm in town.
So go to the skateboard park?

35:26.840 --> 35:28.280
Yeah, right.

35:29.440 --> 35:30.480
Okay, bye.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.400
-Come on.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.240
<i>Straight down</i>
<i>the other end and scores.</i>

35:40.320 --> 35:42.680
<i>-And after he saved that--</i>

35:42.760 --> 35:45.920
<i> Hey, this is Dave.</i>
<i>Can't get to the phone. Leave a message.</i>

35:48.200 --> 35:49.320
<i> …down and played…</i>

35:49.400 --> 35:52.760
-I've already seen this.
No, Mum. No, it's live.

35:52.840 --> 35:55.320
-I saw it yesterday.
-Mum, you can't have seen this.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.600
-I know who wins.
-Who?

35:57.680 --> 35:59.920
-I'll put a bet on.
-You'll see.

36:01.640 --> 36:04.760
-No, come on. Tell me what happens next.
-Watch.

36:04.840 --> 36:07.200
<i> Got themselves</i>
<i>in a bit of a tangle, and the ball…</i>

36:07.280 --> 36:08.840
See! Told you.

36:08.920 --> 36:12.560
Mum, you've never seen this game.
It's on live. It's happening now.

36:12.640 --> 36:15.320
Stop it. I've seen it already.

36:16.560 --> 36:19.680
<i> They have to move the ball</i>
<i>quicker. Kelleher put them under pressure…</i>

36:20.280 --> 36:22.560
<i>Police have made</i>
<i>a fresh appeal to the public</i>

36:22.640 --> 36:25.120
<i>in their search</i>
<i>for Carlton Flynn, aged 20.</i>

36:25.200 --> 36:27.840
<i>Carlton was last seen</i>
<i>in the Livingstone area</i>

36:27.920 --> 36:29.600
<i>driving a Subaru Impreza,</i>

36:29.680 --> 36:34.040
<i>registration number FL55 FLM,</i>
<i>on Friday the 16…</i>

36:34.120 --> 36:37.080
-I'm wearing this to the wedding?
-<i> Wearing a distinctive pink…</i>

36:37.160 --> 36:40.080
No, Mum. These are for my stag night.
I just thought you'd like one.

36:40.160 --> 36:41.360
<i> …green jogging bottoms…</i>

36:41.440 --> 36:43.280
So who else was in Vipers?

36:43.800 --> 36:45.080
Hmm?

36:46.160 --> 36:49.680
Tawny Allure left, great name,
and you didn't come out for a while.

36:49.760 --> 36:52.880
Well, I had to make sure
all the Carlton Flynn flyers were up.

36:53.760 --> 36:55.680
Lorraine Griggs helping you, was she?

36:55.760 --> 37:00.160
Hang on, hang on. Um, Guy Tatum
was reported missing today, April 20th.

37:00.240 --> 37:02.720
-But the last time anyone saw him was--
-April 16th.

37:02.800 --> 37:03.920
Right, April 16th.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.800
The same as the last sighting of Carlton

37:06.880 --> 37:09.560
and, to the day,

37:09.640 --> 37:13.960
17 years after Stewart Green
was last seen.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.360
Get me a printout
of the Carlton Flynn file.

37:17.440 --> 37:18.400
You don't need one.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.080
-I can bring it up on here.
-But I want to have it in my hands.

37:21.160 --> 37:23.520
-When everything's digitalized--
-It'll be a piece of cake.

37:23.600 --> 37:26.800
It's fucking irritating, you know?
I hate progress!

37:27.360 --> 37:29.280
Ugh! So…

37:33.840 --> 37:34.960
Stewart Green.

37:37.680 --> 37:38.760
Carlton Flynn.

37:40.360 --> 37:41.360
Guy Tatum.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.760
The date they were last seen
was April the 16th.

37:44.840 --> 37:48.720
Okay, so for all the missing persons
from the last 17 years,

37:48.800 --> 37:50.760
let's check the last sightings
for the other cases.

37:50.840 --> 37:53.200
Not when they were reported missing,
when they were last seen.

37:53.280 --> 37:54.120
Okay.

37:55.320 --> 37:56.360
Yeah…

38:00.520 --> 38:06.560
Here's one. Jacob Farrell, 2017.
It's not an exact match, but… it's close.

38:07.360 --> 38:08.840
Last seen April 21st.

38:10.400 --> 38:14.600
Peter Berman, 2013.
Reported missing July 10th.

38:15.480 --> 38:18.080
Last seen April 19th.

38:20.800 --> 38:24.000
Greg Wagman, April 15th, 2016.

38:30.080 --> 38:31.440
It's a serial killer.

38:34.480 --> 38:35.320
I can feel it.

38:37.160 --> 38:40.600
Year on year, they were last seen
within a week or two of each other.

38:40.680 --> 38:44.720
Yeah, and they're all missing persons.
Missing. Not dead.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.560
-Let alone murdered.

38:47.080 --> 38:48.840
Sean's here to pick up Seamus.

38:48.920 --> 38:51.880
Photos have been found in a patrol car.
They're at the front desk.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.520
-Can you get them?
-Yeah, sure.

38:53.600 --> 38:57.080
And just… just try and stick
with the missing persons thing, yeah?

38:58.280 --> 38:59.880
It's still a weird cluster.

39:46.640 --> 39:49.320
<i>Hi, this is Guy.</i>
<i>After the beep, get busy.</i>

40:34.320 --> 40:36.720
Right. We've got ten so far.

40:37.400 --> 40:40.600
These were left in the patrol car,
and this is Carlton Flynn.

40:47.360 --> 40:48.760
I don't understand.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.760
I mean… Who took them?
Why leave them anonymously?

40:51.840 --> 40:54.000
-No idea.
-This looks like blood.

41:17.080 --> 41:19.760
Hey, boys? Jordan.

41:20.440 --> 41:22.120
-Have you seen him?
-No.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.280
Yeah, with someone over there.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.960
-Who?
-A man.

41:27.720 --> 41:29.240
Well, can you describe him?

41:30.080 --> 41:30.960
Shaved head.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.240
Dark suit. And looked sort of rich.

41:37.280 --> 41:38.360
Jordan!

41:39.560 --> 41:41.760
Jordan! Jordan!
