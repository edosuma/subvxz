03:09.936 --> 03:11.229
All right demon,

03:11.271 --> 03:13.857
time to wake up and get ready.

03:13.898 --> 03:16.443
You're going into deep pits,
my friend.

03:28.371 --> 03:30.790
Keep me, Lord,
from the hands of the wicked.

03:34.127 --> 03:35.504
Preserve me
from the violent men

03:35.545 --> 03:37.798
who have purpose
to overthrow my goings.

03:47.599 --> 03:49.017
What are you going to do?

03:49.058 --> 03:50.434
Keep your mouth shut, demon.

03:52.771 --> 03:54.231
Are you crazy?

03:55.147 --> 03:56.565
Let me outta here.

03:56.607 --> 03:57.692
You're not going anywhere.

03:57.734 --> 03:58.944
Where's my guitar?

03:58.985 --> 04:00.445
I'm warning you.

04:00.486 --> 04:02.696
You don't know
who you messing with, son.

04:04.825 --> 04:08.327
I know exactly what you are.

04:15.626 --> 04:17.962
They have spread a net
by the wayside.

04:18.003 --> 04:19.964
They have set gins for me.

04:20.005 --> 04:24.344
I said unto the lord,
Thou art my God.

04:24.385 --> 04:27.263
Hear the voice
of my supplications, Lord.

04:27.304 --> 04:29.098
You're so weak.

04:29.974 --> 04:32.184
Your God ain't nothin'!

04:34.854 --> 04:36.772
You're done, Eugene.

04:36.815 --> 04:38.692
You can never
hurt anyone again.

04:42.570 --> 04:45.948
You think those little boxes
are gonna stop me?

04:45.991 --> 04:49.286
Yes. You'll never play again.

05:33.871 --> 05:35.164
God the Lord,

05:35.207 --> 05:37.541
the strength of my salvation,

05:37.584 --> 05:40.712
Thou hast covered my head
on this day of battle.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.549
Let burning coals
fall upon them.

05:45.592 --> 05:47.551
Let them be cast into the fire,

05:47.594 --> 05:51.598
into deep pits
that they rise not up again!

05:52.724 --> 05:54.726
Immortalis sim!

05:54.767 --> 06:00.606
Fui quod sis Summum malum!

06:00.649 --> 06:05.028
I will kill everyone
you ever loved!

06:05.070 --> 06:09.449
I will be back!

07:15.894 --> 07:20.793
GHOST NOTE

07:21.144 --> 07:24.644
Subrip: Pix

08:08.234 --> 08:09.735
Blessed waters...

08:10.820 --> 08:13.573
fill me
with your soothing peace.

08:13.614 --> 08:16.450
Like the river I shall flow,

08:16.493 --> 08:21.039
patiently with joy and ease.

08:24.083 --> 08:25.459
We're leaving in ten minutes.

08:25.501 --> 08:27.002
I'm not going!

08:27.044 --> 08:28.462
Yes, you are!

08:29.130 --> 08:30.631
Don't give me that look.

08:30.674 --> 08:32.424
What look?
I'm not doing anything.

08:32.467 --> 08:34.385
You know exactly what look,
Mallory,

08:34.428 --> 08:36.888
and I don't need your attitude
right now.

08:36.929 --> 08:38.179
Why do I even have to go?

08:38.222 --> 08:39.640
It's not like any of them
like me anyway.

08:39.683 --> 08:41.308
Don't be such a drama queen.

08:41.351 --> 08:43.227
Drama queen? Really?

08:43.270 --> 08:45.563
It's the same thing every year.

08:45.605 --> 08:47.315
You and Dad have fun
with the adults,

08:47.356 --> 08:49.192
drinking, playing games,

08:49.233 --> 08:50.651
while I get stuck
at the kids table

08:50.693 --> 08:52.570
with the whiny little brats.

08:52.611 --> 08:54.238
Then you'll fit right in.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.323
Just let me stay home, please.

08:56.366 --> 08:57.951
You can tell them I'm sick.

08:57.992 --> 09:00.244
Number one, no.

09:00.286 --> 09:01.370
And number two,

09:01.413 --> 09:03.749
could you just try
to fit in a little?

09:03.789 --> 09:05.416
You'd love that,
wouldn't you?

09:05.458 --> 09:07.960
Maybe I should say grace
at dinner.

09:08.002 --> 09:10.087
I think that would be lovely.

09:10.130 --> 09:11.630
Five minutes.

09:14.384 --> 09:15.760
Well, that didn't work.

09:41.577 --> 09:44.121
I'm worried about Mallory.

09:44.164 --> 09:46.500
What for? Witchcraft?

09:46.540 --> 09:48.959
It's just a phase.

09:49.001 --> 09:50.962
No, not witchcraft.

09:51.004 --> 09:53.465
I'm worried how she's
gonna take it when we...

09:56.092 --> 09:58.010
When we tell her that we're
leaving her at your mother's

09:58.053 --> 10:00.388
an extra week while we go
on vacation without her.

10:00.429 --> 10:03.015
She'll be fine, you know.
She's a big girl,

10:03.058 --> 10:05.726
and she'll understand
that we need some alone time.

10:05.769 --> 10:09.106
But, you know...
Besides, my mom loves her.

10:09.146 --> 10:10.272
Yeah? I'm not so sure

10:10.314 --> 10:12.858
she's gonna love
the new Wiccan version.

10:12.900 --> 10:14.568
You'd be surprised
at how progressive

10:14.611 --> 10:16.612
my mother really is.

10:23.285 --> 10:24.787
I sure hope so.

10:45.808 --> 10:47.519
Welcome to hell.

10:48.145 --> 10:49.353
Can you just promise me

10:49.395 --> 10:50.688
that you'll try and have
a little fun

10:50.730 --> 10:52.356
and not make me miserable?

10:52.399 --> 10:54.067
I promise nothing.

10:56.736 --> 10:58.988
I'm comin' for you, buddy!

10:59.029 --> 11:00.073
Can't get away!

11:02.534 --> 11:04.827
Ricky, my arch rival!

11:05.996 --> 11:08.331
And you are looking
as beautiful as ever.

11:08.372 --> 11:10.374
You're not
so bad yourself, Lawrence.

11:10.417 --> 11:12.169
Get it off me!

11:12.209 --> 11:14.545
Kyle, leave your cousin alone.

11:14.587 --> 11:16.630
Mal, you gonna join us
for the big game today?

11:16.673 --> 11:18.049
You can be on my team.

11:18.091 --> 11:21.385
Absolutely. I can't wait.

11:21.428 --> 11:23.429
My little Ricky!

11:23.472 --> 11:26.015
Okay, Ma.
It's good to see you, too.

11:26.057 --> 11:28.851
It's so wonderful
to see you, Jenny.

11:28.894 --> 11:30.895
You too Betty.
It smells delicious in here.

11:30.937 --> 11:34.441
Thank you.
My goodness, Mallory.

11:34.482 --> 11:35.608
Hi, Grandma.

11:35.650 --> 11:39.487
You are getting so big
and so pretty.

11:39.529 --> 11:42.115
I bet you can't
keep the boys away.

11:42.156 --> 11:43.783
I'm lesbian.

11:44.992 --> 11:46.619
She's kidding.

11:53.626 --> 11:55.169
-Butthead.
-Shut up.

11:59.632 --> 12:01.300
No, you better shut your mouth.

12:01.342 --> 12:02.676
You don't talk to me that way.

12:02.718 --> 12:05.137
I am just so thankful
you all can still find the time

12:05.179 --> 12:07.681
to come and visit
this old lady once a year.

12:07.723 --> 12:09.183
Come on, Mom, you know
we're gonna be here

12:09.226 --> 12:10.309
every year for Thanksgiving.

12:10.351 --> 12:13.145
I know, but I'm still thankful.

12:13.188 --> 12:16.441
It's just too bad that
the old bastard's not here

12:16.482 --> 12:18.150
to make our lives miserable,
right?

12:18.193 --> 12:19.568
Jack, please.

12:19.611 --> 12:21.362
Don't talk about your father
like that.

12:21.404 --> 12:22.780
What?

12:22.823 --> 12:26.409
Look, Ma, he was an asshole
and a drunk and you hated him.

12:26.451 --> 12:27.619
Betty, how do you
get this stuffing...

12:27.660 --> 12:28.786
It looks like you're
gonna take his place

12:28.828 --> 12:31.330
as the drunk asshole,
aren't you?

12:31.372 --> 12:32.331
Cheers.

12:32.374 --> 12:33.582
Whatever, Helen.

12:33.625 --> 12:35.419
You have plenty of
drunk Dad stories too, okay.

12:35.459 --> 12:37.294
Rick, do you remember the time

12:37.337 --> 12:39.965
that he beat the shit out of you

12:40.005 --> 12:42.925
for going into his workshop?
You remember that?

12:42.967 --> 12:44.010
Jack, come on.

12:44.052 --> 12:46.638
What about the one
where he choked me

12:46.679 --> 12:48.431
and then threw me down
the stairs of the attic.

12:48.472 --> 12:49.558
Remember that?

12:49.598 --> 12:51.475
-Please stop.
-This is not the time.

12:51.518 --> 12:53.645
You know what?
You complained the most, Helen.

12:53.687 --> 12:55.272
Have you ever
heard of the saying,

12:55.313 --> 12:56.773
"It's better
to let sleeping dogs lie?"

12:56.814 --> 12:58.607
Can we eat in peace? Please.

12:58.650 --> 13:01.986
Your father had his faults,
but deep down he was a good man

13:02.028 --> 13:03.529
-and he loved you.
-Bullshit!

13:03.572 --> 13:04.780
-He did!
-Ma, that is bullshit!

13:10.077 --> 13:12.289
Yeah, and he was an asshole.
Okay?

13:13.749 --> 13:16.042
I mean, fuck!
Jesus Christ, you guys!

13:16.083 --> 13:17.835
I can't breath
in this environment.

13:17.877 --> 13:21.172
I mean, we meet
for a nice family dinner

13:21.213 --> 13:23.174
and this happens every time.

13:23.216 --> 13:25.677
I mean, Jack, we get it,
Dad was an asshole,

13:25.718 --> 13:29.472
we all know that, but he died
eight years ago now.

13:29.514 --> 13:31.183
Let it go.

13:31.223 --> 13:32.516
She's right.

13:32.558 --> 13:34.727
Let's just talk about the...
the turkey bowl.

13:34.770 --> 13:37.021
Right Rick?
Our rivalry?

13:37.063 --> 13:38.689
You know we only see each other
once a year,

13:38.731 --> 13:41.860
let's... enjoy this
while we can.

13:42.903 --> 13:44.529
God, they're stupid.

13:44.571 --> 13:46.907
I thought you didn't
believe in God.

13:46.948 --> 13:48.991
What? God?

13:49.034 --> 13:50.534
No. Shut up.

13:50.577 --> 13:52.370
What do you believe?

13:52.411 --> 13:54.580
Can you just leave me alone?

13:54.622 --> 13:57.208
My mom says
that Mallory's a witch.

13:57.250 --> 13:59.044
No, witches are ugly.

13:59.086 --> 14:00.669
Thank you, Kyle.

14:00.712 --> 14:03.340
-Can you do magic?
-I guess.

14:03.380 --> 14:05.382
Can you make me disappear?

14:05.424 --> 14:08.303
No. That would be a magician,

14:08.345 --> 14:10.222
and those are just illusions.

14:10.263 --> 14:11.431
I'm Wiccan.

14:11.472 --> 14:12.933
What's Wiccan?

14:12.973 --> 14:15.976
Wiccan is a very old religion.

14:16.019 --> 14:18.855
We believe that as long
as no one gets hurt,

14:18.896 --> 14:20.731
we can do whatever we want.

14:20.774 --> 14:22.900
My dad says we're Christians

14:22.943 --> 14:24.736
and all the other religions
are cults.

14:24.778 --> 14:26.446
Or terrorists.

14:26.487 --> 14:27.780
Good for him.

14:27.823 --> 14:29.908
You should definitely
listen to your dad.

14:29.949 --> 14:31.742
Can you talk to the dead?

14:31.784 --> 14:35.288
Anyone can talk to the dead.
You just need a Ouija board.

14:35.329 --> 14:36.747
What about a séance?

14:36.789 --> 14:40.544
Yeah. Sure. Whatever.
Can I just eat?

14:40.584 --> 14:43.546
Yeah, let's do a séance!

14:47.299 --> 14:49.468
-Let's go!
-Hike!

14:49.510 --> 14:50.971
Going down! Going down!

15:01.856 --> 15:03.817
What do you creeps want?

15:03.858 --> 15:05.985
We wanna have a séance.

15:07.696 --> 15:09.239
Okay. Sure.

15:09.280 --> 15:12.616
We're gonna need
a few things first.

15:12.659 --> 15:14.327
Everyone hold hands.

15:15.286 --> 15:16.620
Focus on the candle.

15:19.540 --> 15:21.584
Blood of my blood,

15:21.625 --> 15:23.794
you spirits of love,

15:23.837 --> 15:26.213
come from below

15:26.255 --> 15:28.174
and from above.

15:28.842 --> 15:30.552
Entities loving,

15:30.593 --> 15:32.470
who wish me well,

15:32.511 --> 15:34.388
come to this circle

15:34.430 --> 15:37.016
when I sound the bell.

15:46.610 --> 15:47.736
Go now!

15:47.778 --> 15:49.529
Leave this place at once

15:49.571 --> 15:53.200
or you all will... die!

15:56.077 --> 15:57.703
-What is it?
-It's a ghost.

15:57.746 --> 15:59.456
Everyone calm down.

16:14.888 --> 16:16.264
What is it?

16:16.305 --> 16:17.807
It's a guitar.

16:35.866 --> 16:38.202
It looks like
some sort of journal.

16:49.088 --> 16:51.382
Looks like a piece of junk.

16:59.765 --> 17:01.892
What's wrong with you?

17:11.986 --> 17:13.821
It's just supposed to be
a game of touch.

17:13.863 --> 17:15.573
Quit your whining,
you big baby.

17:15.614 --> 17:16.781
She barely touched you.

17:16.824 --> 17:18.784
-Look at my nose!
-Sweetheart, I am so sorry.

17:18.826 --> 17:20.411
What? We're leaving.

17:25.458 --> 17:26.375
Hey.

17:26.417 --> 17:27.794
You know,
I think we're gonna leave too.

17:27.835 --> 17:29.170
I think the girls are tired.

17:29.211 --> 17:31.088
Well you have to
have some pie first.

17:31.130 --> 17:33.967
I'm sorry, Mom.
We'll stay longer next year.

17:34.008 --> 17:35.050
Come on, girls.

17:35.092 --> 17:37.012
Lawrence,
get our stuff together!

17:49.399 --> 17:50.859
Are we leaving too?

17:53.445 --> 17:54.862
What?

17:59.700 --> 18:01.035
I can't believe this.

18:01.078 --> 18:02.537
Just try to understand, Mal.

18:02.579 --> 18:04.790
I mean, We haven't
been alone together since...

18:04.831 --> 18:06.666
-Ever.
-We just need some time.

18:06.707 --> 18:08.209
No, I get that.

18:08.251 --> 18:11.379
What I don't get
is why you guys didn't tell me.

18:11.420 --> 18:14.173
Why would you wait until we're
all the way out at Grandma's?

18:14.216 --> 18:15.801
What did you think
would happen?

18:15.842 --> 18:19.638
I don't know. In hindsight, it
probably wasn't the best idea.

18:19.678 --> 18:21.180
Ya think?

18:21.223 --> 18:23.350
I feel like you tricked me

18:23.390 --> 18:25.476
and you all are just gonna have
a good laugh about it later.

18:25.518 --> 18:28.604
-Give me a break, Mallory.
-It might seem like that now,

18:28.647 --> 18:30.774
but it's not what we intended.

18:30.815 --> 18:31.982
That's great
that you didn't intend

18:32.025 --> 18:33.235
to make me feel like shit.

18:33.275 --> 18:35.361
Look, Mallory, we're sorry

18:35.403 --> 18:37.488
and you're just gonna
need to get over it, okay?

18:37.531 --> 18:38.615
Whatever.

18:38.657 --> 18:41.451
So what am I supposed to wear
for the next week?

18:41.493 --> 18:42.910
I packed you a bag.

18:42.953 --> 18:45.455
I guess you thought
of everything.

18:45.496 --> 18:47.666
You know, I'm almost 18.

18:47.707 --> 18:50.459
You could've at least
treated me like an adult.

18:51.836 --> 18:53.504
Come on, Mal.

18:53.546 --> 18:55.381
Have fun in Hawaii.

18:56.006 --> 18:57.383
That went well.

19:18.738 --> 19:20.489
Assholes.

19:37.090 --> 19:40.677
All right, Mom.
We'll see ya next year.

19:40.718 --> 19:42.094
Is Ashley not feeling well?

19:42.137 --> 19:43.221
She'll be fine.

19:43.263 --> 19:45.682
I'm sure she's just
in one of her moods.

19:45.724 --> 19:47.184
Come on, Lawrence, let's go.

19:47.225 --> 19:49.561
All right, girls, come on!

19:49.602 --> 19:51.313
Girls, come on, let's go!

19:51.353 --> 19:54.024
Kids! Listen to your father!

20:26.973 --> 20:28.265
Now, don't you worry
about a thing.

20:28.307 --> 20:30.017
I've got lots of games.

20:30.060 --> 20:32.437
She's gonna love
keeping her grandma company.

20:32.478 --> 20:34.271
Thank you so much
for doing this, Betty.

20:34.313 --> 20:36.149
-Hush now.
-Means so much to us.

20:36.190 --> 20:38.442
It's my pleasure.

20:38.485 --> 20:39.861
See ya next time, Mom.

20:39.902 --> 20:41.404
All right.

20:41.446 --> 20:42.823
Shit.

21:03.968 --> 21:05.886
Are you okay?

21:05.928 --> 21:07.013
Yeah.

21:07.054 --> 21:09.099
Just a little surprised.

21:10.141 --> 21:12.726
We can just make
the best of it.

21:12.768 --> 21:14.603
What do you like to do?

21:14.646 --> 21:15.981
I don't know.

21:16.022 --> 21:18.024
Watch movies on Netflix,
I guess.

21:18.065 --> 21:19.985
Okay.
That sounds like fun.

21:20.025 --> 21:21.361
Come on.

21:26.533 --> 21:28.075
What's Netflix?

21:40.630 --> 21:42.340
And gin.

21:44.217 --> 21:46.052
You're way too good at this.

21:47.845 --> 21:49.472
You want
to play something else?

21:49.514 --> 21:52.976
I think I have got backgammon
around here somewhere.

21:53.017 --> 21:54.602
No. I'm good.

21:55.937 --> 21:57.731
Can you tell me about Grandpa?

21:58.899 --> 22:00.816
What do you want to know?

22:00.859 --> 22:02.151
I don't know.

22:03.111 --> 22:05.322
I just remember him
being very distant,

22:05.362 --> 22:07.448
and a little scary.

22:07.490 --> 22:09.825
He wasn't always that way.

22:11.285 --> 22:14.331
He actually
used to be a preacher.

22:14.371 --> 22:17.292
So why did everyone
talk so bad about him?

22:19.919 --> 22:24.381
Because no one remembers him
before he started drinking.

22:24.423 --> 22:27.301
Only your father was born then.

22:27.343 --> 22:28.594
He didn't always drink?

22:28.637 --> 22:33.809
No, he never touched alcohol
until the ‘70s.

22:33.850 --> 22:35.142
Well, did something happen,

22:35.185 --> 22:37.312
like, that drove him to drink?

22:38.522 --> 22:42.900
I suppose so.
He started drinking after...

22:42.942 --> 22:45.361
I get it.

22:46.071 --> 22:47.656
My dad drove him to drink.

22:47.697 --> 22:49.949
No. No, dear.

22:49.990 --> 22:51.784
He loved your father.

22:51.826 --> 22:53.744
So that's why he beat him?

22:53.786 --> 22:56.456
Actually, yes.

22:57.123 --> 23:00.626
Your father was... willful.

23:01.460 --> 23:03.045
He didn't spank him to be mean.

23:03.088 --> 23:05.507
He was trying to protect him.

23:05.548 --> 23:06.924
Protect him?

23:06.967 --> 23:08.427
From what?

23:08.467 --> 23:11.888
You don't let a child stick
his finger in a light socket.

23:11.929 --> 23:13.806
You slap his hand
so he'll learn.

23:13.849 --> 23:17.269
It sounds like he did a little
more than slap his hand.

23:17.310 --> 23:18.937
What was so terrible?

23:20.021 --> 23:22.023
You know what?
It's not important.

23:22.064 --> 23:24.234
Let's keep playing.

23:24.275 --> 23:26.777
Was he a musician?

23:26.820 --> 23:28.739
Goodness, no.

23:28.780 --> 23:30.657
Why do you ask?

23:30.698 --> 23:32.199
No reason.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.203
Actually, I'm kind of tired.

23:36.246 --> 23:38.206
Is it okay if I go to bed?

23:38.247 --> 23:39.415
Of course, it's okay dear.

23:39.457 --> 23:41.459
You don't have
to ask permission.

23:42.460 --> 23:44.044
See ya in the morning.

23:44.086 --> 23:45.254
Sleep well.

24:03.398 --> 24:05.775
Grandma?
Is that you?

26:00.806 --> 26:01.932
What are you doing?

26:01.975 --> 26:05.437
Grandma, my God, you almost
gave me a heart attack.

26:06.897 --> 26:09.691
You shouldn't be
going into the attic.

26:11.610 --> 26:13.611
I thought this door was locked.

26:13.652 --> 26:14.945
I'm sorry.

26:14.987 --> 26:18.283
It's just that you have a rat.
A really big one.

26:18.324 --> 26:19.909
Okay.
It's nothing to worry about.

26:19.950 --> 26:22.120
I will call the exterminator
in the morning.

26:22.161 --> 26:24.789
Please don't go back up there.

26:24.831 --> 26:26.123
I won't.

26:26.166 --> 26:27.793
Promise me.

26:27.833 --> 26:29.251
Really?

26:29.294 --> 26:31.254
Mallory I need to promise me

26:31.295 --> 26:33.172
you will not
go back up there.

26:33.215 --> 26:34.591
I promise.

26:34.632 --> 26:37.677
Good.
Why don't you go on to bed now?

26:37.718 --> 26:39.386
Yeah.

26:43.307 --> 26:44.683
Goodnight.

27:59.884 --> 28:01.635
Mallory?

28:02.928 --> 28:04.014
Hey, Rodney.

28:04.890 --> 28:06.475
It's been a long time.

28:06.515 --> 28:07.933
Yeah, I guess.

28:09.060 --> 28:10.687
About four years.

28:12.104 --> 28:13.606
You've grown.

28:15.233 --> 28:16.693
So have you.

28:18.778 --> 28:19.779
Nice car.

28:19.821 --> 28:23.492
You like it?
It's a '73 Charger.

28:23.533 --> 28:24.743
Looks fast.

28:24.784 --> 28:26.786
You wanna go for a ride?

28:26.828 --> 28:28.038
Maybe later.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.289
I'm all sweaty.

28:30.207 --> 28:31.582
What's with the music?

28:31.624 --> 28:33.292
Since I started playing guitar

28:33.334 --> 28:35.795
I've been listening to lots
of different styles of music.

28:35.836 --> 28:38.923
This is
Mississippi Delta blues.

28:38.965 --> 28:39.966
You like it?

28:40.007 --> 28:41.217
I don't know.

28:41.258 --> 28:42.968
It's different.

28:43.844 --> 28:47.140
Have you ever heard
of Eugene Burns?

28:47.181 --> 28:48.557
Sure.

28:48.600 --> 28:51.602
I haven't heard anything
about him for a while, but...

28:51.644 --> 28:53.229
there's lots of legends.

28:53.271 --> 28:56.108
He was known as
"the Devil of the Delta."

28:56.149 --> 28:57.734
Why the devil?

28:57.775 --> 28:59.986
The legend is, after he sold
his soul to the Devil,

29:00.027 --> 29:03.114
he went on some sort
of killing spree...

29:03.156 --> 29:04.241
and was never caught.

29:04.282 --> 29:07.284
He just disappeared like
50 years ago, or something.

29:07.326 --> 29:08.994
Creepy?

29:09.996 --> 29:12.541
Why?
Where'd you hear about him?

29:12.582 --> 29:14.333
I should really go
get cleaned up.

29:14.376 --> 29:16.503
Okay.

29:16.544 --> 29:18.255
Let's hang out later.

29:19.255 --> 29:20.506
Cool.

29:20.548 --> 29:21.966
It's a date, then.

29:26.303 --> 29:27.889
It's a date.

30:27.865 --> 30:32.912
Yes. I need to have someone
come out and check my attic.

30:32.954 --> 30:35.332
My granddaughter saw a rat.

30:36.749 --> 30:38.959
I can make you some breakfast.

30:41.670 --> 30:43.798
Sure.
Tomorrow will be fine.

30:45.217 --> 30:46.383
Okay.

31:17.873 --> 31:19.418
This look familiar?

31:19.458 --> 31:21.210
Sort of.

31:21.253 --> 31:23.213
It seems smaller somehow.

31:25.465 --> 31:28.301
The treehouse is that way,
just over the creek right?

31:28.342 --> 31:29.718
Good memory.

31:29.761 --> 31:31.763
Too bad it fell apart.

31:31.804 --> 31:34.640
That sucks.

31:34.682 --> 31:36.434
I used to love that place.

31:37.643 --> 31:39.813
That's where you rescued me
from the dragon.

31:42.064 --> 31:48.154
So that means Mr. Torres'
old well is... that way.

31:48.196 --> 31:49.322
Right?

32:05.839 --> 32:08.800
This place used to terrify me.

32:08.842 --> 32:11.594
Everyone used to say
it was a bottomless pit.

32:11.636 --> 32:13.138
I know.

32:13.179 --> 32:14.680
It's funny, right?

32:14.723 --> 32:17.267
Do you think there's
still water in it?

32:17.309 --> 32:19.144
Only one way to find out.

32:19.186 --> 32:21.772
My God. Be careful.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.577
That is so deep.

32:36.620 --> 32:37.912
I can't believe he hasn't
filled it in yet.

32:37.954 --> 32:39.289
That seems so dangerous.

32:39.331 --> 32:40.665
Yeah.

32:40.707 --> 32:42.833
Let's get out of here.
This place gives me the creeps.

32:42.876 --> 32:46.171
Hey, you wanna go
see Mr. Torres' horses?

32:46.213 --> 32:47.505
Definitely.

33:05.774 --> 33:07.191
What's this mess?

33:07.234 --> 33:09.528
Sorry!
We spilled a little!

33:10.903 --> 33:12.780
You know you're not supposed
to pour your own cereal.

33:12.823 --> 33:14.533
Where's your sister?

33:14.573 --> 33:16.784
She won't get up.

33:17.744 --> 33:19.286
-Bye, babe.
-Hey.

33:19.329 --> 33:22.249
Have a good trip.
I'll go check on Ashley.

33:22.290 --> 33:23.625
Okay girls, I'm leaving!

33:23.667 --> 33:25.127
Love you, Daddy.

33:25.168 --> 33:26.378
Bye.

33:35.428 --> 33:37.179
Hey, Ash, you okay?

33:37.221 --> 33:38.347
Go away.

33:38.390 --> 33:40.434
What's the matter?
Are you sick?

33:40.475 --> 33:42.476
Just leave me alone.

33:42.518 --> 33:44.103
Can I get you anything?

33:45.063 --> 33:46.730
Okay, I guess I'll work
from home today.

33:46.773 --> 33:48.358
I'll come check on you later.

33:57.825 --> 34:00.746
Good boy. Yeah.

34:00.787 --> 34:02.247
My God.

34:02.289 --> 34:03.915
You remember when we used to
go down to the creek

34:03.956 --> 34:05.750
and swim in our underwear?

34:05.791 --> 34:07.376
Yeah.

34:07.418 --> 34:10.087
We're pretty lucky we survived
out here.

34:10.130 --> 34:11.505
What do you mean?

34:11.547 --> 34:14.592
I mean, out here,
around an open well,

34:14.632 --> 34:16.010
a creek filled with snakes.

34:16.052 --> 34:17.844
Other kids haven't been
so lucky.

34:17.887 --> 34:20.306
My God.
Somebody fell into the well?

34:20.347 --> 34:23.601
Hell, no.
Nobody fell into that old well.

34:23.641 --> 34:25.226
What's that, Mr. Torres?

34:25.268 --> 34:27.646
Now don't you go
spreading rumors about my well.

34:27.688 --> 34:30.108
No sir.
Of course not.

34:30.150 --> 34:31.275
Nobody's fallen into that well

34:31.318 --> 34:33.945
for at least
a couple of months.

34:35.572 --> 34:36.907
Just kidding, sweetheart.

34:36.947 --> 34:39.533
Nobody's fallen into that well.
I promise.

34:39.574 --> 34:41.327
Besides,
I'm filling that thing in

34:41.369 --> 34:43.454
and I'm pouring some concrete
over it.

34:43.496 --> 34:46.291
So you don't have to worry
about falling in.

34:46.331 --> 34:49.335
There's a storm coming in.
Stay away from that creek.

34:49.376 --> 34:51.962
Really? Why?

34:52.005 --> 34:54.047
A kid drown last year.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.175
How's that even possible?

34:56.217 --> 34:58.762
The water's only
a few feet deep.

34:58.803 --> 35:00.222
Well, it is now,

35:00.262 --> 35:04.183
but when it rains,
it becomes a raging river.

35:04.226 --> 35:05.602
Jesus.

35:06.186 --> 35:07.062
Poor kid.

35:07.813 --> 35:09.523
You kids wanna go for a ride?

35:09.564 --> 35:11.024
No thanks.

35:11.066 --> 35:13.819
I'm gonna take Mallory
into town for some lunch.

35:13.860 --> 35:15.570
You kids be good.

35:15.611 --> 35:16.988
We will.

35:22.244 --> 35:25.704
So what's with
the devil necklace?

35:25.747 --> 35:27.916
What? This?

35:27.957 --> 35:30.961
This isn't a devil necklace.
It's a Wiccan symbol.

35:31.001 --> 35:32.878
Wiccans don't believe
in the devil.

35:32.921 --> 35:34.172
So you're a witch then?

35:34.213 --> 35:36.215
Yes, and if
you're not careful...

35:36.258 --> 35:37.801
You'll turn me into a frog?

35:37.843 --> 35:39.302
Absolutely.

35:42.012 --> 35:43.681
You know, besides Eugene Burns,

35:43.722 --> 35:47.768
a lot of other blues musicians
sold their souls to the Devil.

35:47.811 --> 35:49.187
Cool.

35:49.229 --> 35:51.689
I'm just saying because you
seem interested in the music.

35:51.731 --> 35:55.736
I just found an old guitar
in my grandma's attic.

35:55.776 --> 35:58.655
Really?
From Eugene Burns?

35:58.697 --> 35:59.905
I guess.

35:59.947 --> 36:02.825
His name is stenciled
on the case.

36:02.867 --> 36:04.410
That's cool.

36:05.579 --> 36:06.872
It might be worth something.

36:06.912 --> 36:08.831
Well it doesn't matter.

36:08.874 --> 36:10.082
It's in my grandma's attic

36:10.124 --> 36:11.751
and she doesn't want me
going up there.

36:11.793 --> 36:14.086
Besides, there's rats.

36:15.255 --> 36:17.298
You know, there's and old story
about Eugene Burns.

36:17.340 --> 36:19.425
That the last record
he recorded

36:19.468 --> 36:21.553
was supposedly so evil

36:21.595 --> 36:24.014
anyone who heard it
would die a horrible death

36:24.055 --> 36:26.725
and be taken straight to Hell.

36:26.767 --> 36:27.851
I don't think anyone's

36:27.892 --> 36:30.394
ever heard the actual record,
though.

36:30.436 --> 36:33.272
I think it was called...
"Ghost Note."

36:35.400 --> 36:36.443
Wait.

36:36.485 --> 36:37.736
Have you heard of it?

36:37.778 --> 36:39.696
It sounds familiar.

36:39.738 --> 36:41.907
Well, if you find that
in your attic, let me know.

36:41.947 --> 36:44.825
That would definitely
be worth a fortune.

36:44.867 --> 36:46.285
Really?

36:46.327 --> 36:47.454
Why?

36:48.537 --> 36:51.541
There aren't any copies
known to be in existence.

36:51.582 --> 36:53.043
Really?

36:54.628 --> 36:56.463
Let's take a ride into town.

36:56.505 --> 36:58.090
Okay.

37:05.387 --> 37:07.640
Mallory? Is that you?

37:08.809 --> 37:11.227
Can you come and see me, please?

37:14.689 --> 37:15.774
Yeah, Grandma?

37:15.816 --> 37:17.567
I need to tell you something...

37:17.608 --> 37:19.985
It's... about the attic

37:20.028 --> 37:23.573
and why I was so upset
that you went up there.

37:23.615 --> 37:24.866
Okay.

37:24.907 --> 37:26.534
Come and sit.

37:33.291 --> 37:35.836
So, I told you last night,

37:35.876 --> 37:40.297
that your grandfather was
a minister most of his life.

37:40.340 --> 37:44.635
Well, as far back
as I can remember...

37:44.677 --> 37:47.888
he would go
to people's homes and...

37:47.930 --> 37:50.809
help them get rid
of their demons.

37:50.851 --> 37:54.646
What? Like, literally?

37:54.688 --> 37:56.898
He helped a lot of people.

37:56.939 --> 37:58.691
He was very strong.

38:00.193 --> 38:03.113
Sometimes the power of the
Devil was even stronger, and...

38:03.155 --> 38:05.448
it would take a lot
out of him.

38:05.490 --> 38:06.491
Wait.

38:06.532 --> 38:10.494
Are you trying to tell me
That he was an exorcist?

38:10.537 --> 38:12.664
I don't believe in that stuff.

38:12.706 --> 38:14.249
What stuff?

38:14.291 --> 38:17.794
God and the Devil.
Being possessed by demons...

38:17.836 --> 38:19.296
Any of that stuff.

38:19.336 --> 38:21.338
The truth is the truth, Mallory.

38:21.381 --> 38:23.842
It doesn't matter
if you believe it.

38:23.883 --> 38:25.302
Okay.

38:25.718 --> 38:26.802
Go on.

38:27.387 --> 38:28.722
Well...

38:29.389 --> 38:32.224
It was the summer of 1970.

38:33.226 --> 38:35.227
Milton had
a friend from church,

38:35.269 --> 38:37.688
I think his name was Charlie,

38:37.731 --> 38:40.859
and Charlie worked
as a sound engineer

38:40.901 --> 38:43.403
at the local recording studio.

38:44.780 --> 38:46.531
One day, he told Milton

38:46.572 --> 38:50.743
that he had just recorded
a record for a blues musician

38:50.785 --> 38:54.914
by the name of Eugene Burns.

38:54.956 --> 38:56.749
Eugene Burns?

38:56.791 --> 38:57.583
Yes.

38:58.918 --> 39:03.214
He was well known in the area
but not for his music.

39:03.256 --> 39:06.051
He was linked
to several murders...

39:06.093 --> 39:07.886
but he was never convicted.

39:07.927 --> 39:09.929
I don't know why you're
telling me any of this.

39:09.970 --> 39:12.724
Eugene was evil...

39:12.765 --> 39:15.184
and Charlie knew it.

39:15.227 --> 39:17.270
He needed Milton...

39:17.311 --> 39:20.272
to rid him of the demon.

39:20.314 --> 39:25.070
So you're saying that Grandpa
and this Charlie person

39:25.111 --> 39:27.905
performed an exorcism
on Eugene?

39:27.947 --> 39:30.574
It took them many months...

39:30.617 --> 39:34.246
but they finally
got the demon out.

39:35.414 --> 39:37.624
It nearly killed
your grandfather.

39:39.959 --> 39:42.044
When it was over...

39:42.086 --> 39:44.630
Milton had
some of Eugene's things,

39:44.673 --> 39:48.593
and he hid them away
up in our attic...

39:48.635 --> 39:52.722
and he told us
never to go up there.

39:52.764 --> 39:54.015
Okay.

39:54.057 --> 39:56.101
Well, thank you for telling me,

39:56.142 --> 39:59.603
but demons
and some dead guys things,

39:59.646 --> 40:00.897
they don't scare me.

40:00.939 --> 40:03.942
Mallory, you may have different
beliefs and that's fine.

40:03.983 --> 40:06.402
I'm fine with whatever it is.

40:07.361 --> 40:10.698
But, I know Eugene was evil...

40:10.740 --> 40:14.952
and if your grandfather said
to stay away from his things

40:14.994 --> 40:20.166
then I know he had a very good
reason for doing it.

40:20.207 --> 40:22.461
Okay, I'll stay away.

40:23.253 --> 40:24.671
Thank you, honey.

43:56.675 --> 43:58.093
Don't you dare touch me!

43:58.135 --> 44:00.053
Get back! No!

44:00.095 --> 44:02.180
No!

44:07.477 --> 44:09.187
Don't be afraid.

44:14.401 --> 44:16.194
Who's there?

45:03.825 --> 45:05.118
-Go away!
-Ay, Dios mio!

45:05.160 --> 45:07.537
-My gosh.
-I'm supposed to check the attic.

45:07.579 --> 45:11.249
I am so sorry. I thought
you were someone else.

45:16.296 --> 45:18.131
Here she is now.

45:19.423 --> 45:20.883
It's your mom.

45:23.302 --> 45:25.554
Hi, Mom.
How's Hawaii?

46:19.276 --> 46:20.861
Stella.

47:03.360 --> 47:05.237
Sure. Okay.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.948
I love you, too.

47:10.285 --> 47:11.369
Don't worry about a thing.

47:11.410 --> 47:13.371
We're gonna
watch Netflix tonight.

47:24.465 --> 47:26.008
Did you see it?

47:28.720 --> 47:30.639
Did you hear me?

47:32.765 --> 47:34.267
Where are you going?

47:37.061 --> 47:38.188
Hey.

47:39.564 --> 47:41.191
Are you okay?

47:42.608 --> 47:46.278
From the depths of Hell,
he has come.

47:46.320 --> 47:47.572
What did you say?

47:47.613 --> 47:49.323
He's coming for you.

47:53.035 --> 47:54.954
Did you find anything?

47:54.996 --> 47:57.791
No, ma'am.
There's nothing in the attic.

48:00.418 --> 48:02.128
What do I owe you?

48:04.463 --> 48:06.298
Well, that was strange.

48:07.300 --> 48:08.802
Yeah.

48:53.472 --> 48:55.265
Are you feeling well?

48:55.307 --> 48:56.640
Yeah, I'm fine.

48:57.767 --> 48:59.477
Maybe that's him with the bill.

49:02.521 --> 49:04.023
It's just Rodney.

49:05.608 --> 49:07.151
It's nice to see you, too.

49:07.193 --> 49:08.235
Sorry.

49:08.278 --> 49:10.238
We thought you were
the exterminator coming back.

49:10.280 --> 49:11.865
I just saw him leave.

49:12.948 --> 49:16.077
Grandma, you remember
Rodney, from next door?

49:16.119 --> 49:18.162
Yes, of course.
Hello, Rodney.

49:18.204 --> 49:20.498
Hello, ma'am.
It's nice to see you again.

49:20.539 --> 49:21.999
Mallory, don't run off.

49:22.041 --> 49:24.085
We need to go into town
to get a few things.

49:24.126 --> 49:25.336
Okay, Grandma.

49:29.590 --> 49:31.467
Are you gonna invite me in?

49:31.510 --> 49:33.928
Yeah.
Come in.

49:39.142 --> 49:40.185
What's up?

49:40.227 --> 49:42.354
I wanted to see if you
could show me that guitar.

49:42.394 --> 49:44.355
-No way.
-Why not?

49:44.396 --> 49:46.482
Keep your voice down.

49:46.525 --> 49:49.360
I told you, my grandma doesn't
want me going up there.

49:49.403 --> 49:50.695
She's about to leave.

49:50.736 --> 49:52.238
It's not just that.

49:53.490 --> 49:56.368
Ever since I found it,
I've been seeing...

49:56.410 --> 49:59.454
I don't know, I've just
been seeing weird things.

49:59.496 --> 50:02.706
I'm beginning to think
it really is evil.

50:02.749 --> 50:04.876
It's a guitar, Mallory.

50:13.175 --> 50:14.885
Please, Rodney, just leave.

50:14.927 --> 50:16.804
-Are you'll right?
-No, I'm not.

50:16.847 --> 50:18.223
What kind of witch are you?

50:18.264 --> 50:20.433
Can't you just cast a spell
and make it all better?

50:20.474 --> 50:22.726
Don't be a jackass.

50:22.769 --> 50:24.229
I'm sorry, Mallory.

50:25.104 --> 50:26.439
Just go.

50:37.742 --> 50:39.494
Did Rodney go home?

50:39.535 --> 50:40.412
Yeah.

50:40.454 --> 50:42.747
That was a fast visit.

50:42.789 --> 50:44.040
Are you ready to go?

50:44.081 --> 50:46.500
Actually,
I'm not feeling very well.

50:46.543 --> 50:47.753
Is it okay if I stay home?

50:47.793 --> 50:51.088
Of course it's okay, honey.

50:51.131 --> 50:52.174
Do you have diarrhea?

50:52.215 --> 50:54.925
No, Grandma.
I just have cramps.

50:54.968 --> 50:58.096
Okay.
I'll get you some Midol.

50:58.137 --> 50:59.305
Okay.

51:09.733 --> 51:12.943
I told you guys not
to leave stuff on the stairs.

51:12.985 --> 51:14.987
You're going to kill someone.

51:17.157 --> 51:18.658
Are you listening to me?

51:23.747 --> 51:25.332
Ashley.

51:25.372 --> 51:26.791
You look terrible.

51:26.832 --> 51:30.044
Let's get you back to bed.
You're burning up.

52:10.251 --> 52:13.505
If spirits threaten me
in this place...

52:14.673 --> 52:16.967
fight water by water...

52:17.008 --> 52:19.468
fire by fire...

52:21.387 --> 52:24.640
and banish their souls
into nothingness...

52:35.193 --> 52:40.031
and remove all their powers
until the last trace...

52:52.586 --> 52:58.967
and let these evil beings
flee, through time and space.

53:18.570 --> 53:19.571
Grandma!

53:20.238 --> 53:21.490
Grandma, wait!

53:27.662 --> 53:28.997
Grandma!

53:32.249 --> 53:35.086
I'm sorry!
Wait, Grandma!

53:35.128 --> 53:37.005
Let me explain!

53:39.298 --> 53:40.467
Grandma!

53:43.302 --> 53:44.595
Grandma!

53:46.972 --> 53:48.307
Grandma?

55:53.057 --> 55:54.476
Is that real?

55:54.517 --> 55:55.726
You tell me.

56:15.122 --> 56:16.456
Welcome!

56:20.459 --> 56:23.255
You guys looking for something
or just browsing?

56:23.296 --> 56:25.298
We need to see Mr. X.

56:26.675 --> 56:29.385
Hey, Xander,
somebody's here for you!

56:32.472 --> 56:35.057
Rodney, my man.
What's up?

56:35.099 --> 56:36.058
It's been a while.

56:36.101 --> 56:37.727
You still lookin'
for delta blues?

56:37.769 --> 56:40.272
I got a pristine copy of John
Lee Hooker's "Boogie Chillen".

56:40.313 --> 56:41.398
I'll make you great deal, man.

56:41.439 --> 56:44.066
-No, thanks.
-So, who's your friend?

56:44.108 --> 56:46.610
Mallory, this is Mr. X.
Mr. X., Mallory.

56:46.653 --> 56:48.905
Mallory, it is a pleasure
to meet you.

56:48.947 --> 56:50.240
You can call me Xander.

56:50.282 --> 56:52.450
Mr. X. Is way too formal.

56:53.117 --> 56:55.202
And this is Lilith.

56:55.996 --> 56:58.122
Nice to meet you both.

56:58.164 --> 57:00.374
Anyways, how about
some Howlin' Wolf?

57:00.416 --> 57:03.627
Got a first pressing of
"Smokestack Lightning" somewhere.

57:03.669 --> 57:05.630
What do you know
about Eugene Burns?

57:05.671 --> 57:07.882
Eugene Burns.
Let me see...

57:07.923 --> 57:10.134
Got one right here.

57:10.177 --> 57:12.053
It's not in greatest
of shape, man.

57:12.095 --> 57:13.305
But for you, five bucks.

57:13.345 --> 57:15.389
What do you know
about "Ghost Note?"

57:15.432 --> 57:17.684
"Ghost Note"?
I definitely don't have that.

57:17.726 --> 57:21.313
Eugene Burns disappeared before
any copies could be pressed.

57:21.354 --> 57:23.273
They say he took the original
recording with him.

57:23.314 --> 57:25.650
If one was ever
even recorded at all.

57:25.691 --> 57:26.650
What do you mean?

57:26.693 --> 57:29.111
Well, there's all this
hype about it, man.

57:29.153 --> 57:30.488
If you ask me,
I'd say it's probably

57:30.530 --> 57:32.823
some kind of an urban legend.

57:32.865 --> 57:35.409
Well, what would it be worth?

57:35.452 --> 57:38.747
I don't know.
Probably thousands.

57:39.831 --> 57:43.001
But supposedly anybody
who ever heard that album

57:43.043 --> 57:44.544
ended up dead, so...

57:44.586 --> 57:47.589
So, you know the history then?

57:48.798 --> 57:51.717
You mean how Eugene recorded
his soul into the vinyl

57:51.760 --> 57:53.095
to become immortal?

57:53.135 --> 57:54.512
Yeah, man,

57:54.553 --> 57:56.889
I've heard all those
crazy stories before.

57:56.932 --> 57:58.225
Do you believe ‘em?

57:58.265 --> 58:00.684
What's goin' on, Rodney?

58:00.727 --> 58:01.978
Show him.

58:11.655 --> 58:13.365
Fuck me.

58:19.329 --> 58:21.497
Certainly appears
to be authentic.

58:29.881 --> 58:32.384
You know it only
plays backwards, right?

58:34.510 --> 58:36.053
You guys didn't play it,
did you?

58:36.095 --> 58:36.804
No.

58:37.097 --> 58:38.640
Good.

58:38.682 --> 58:41.517
'Cause if you had, you probably
would've killed each other.

58:41.559 --> 58:44.019
You saw something, didn't you?

58:44.061 --> 58:44.770
What?

58:46.021 --> 58:47.731
I don't know
what you're talking about.

58:47.773 --> 58:49.150
Yes you do.

58:49.191 --> 58:52.153
You look way too worried to be
interested in some legend.

58:52.195 --> 58:54.238
And I can tell from the
pentagram that you're wearing

58:54.280 --> 58:56.741
that you believe in spirits.

58:56.782 --> 58:58.617
So what did you see?

58:59.577 --> 59:01.704
I'm sure it's nothing.

59:01.747 --> 59:04.916
I've just been
having strange dreams.

59:04.957 --> 59:07.209
More like... visions.

59:07.251 --> 59:09.086
What kind of visions?

59:09.128 --> 59:10.255
I don't know,

59:10.296 --> 59:13.048
flashes of blood and torture.

59:13.090 --> 59:14.592
After you found the record?

59:14.633 --> 59:16.844
No. After I found his guitar.

59:16.887 --> 59:18.180
Wait, wait, wait.

59:18.220 --> 59:20.181
You're telling me
you found Astaroth?

59:20.222 --> 59:21.390
Astaroth?

59:21.432 --> 59:23.642
Astaroth is the name
of the demon

59:23.684 --> 59:25.936
that possessed his guitar.

59:25.979 --> 59:27.272
I guess.

59:27.314 --> 59:29.524
I just found a guitar
with his name on it.

59:29.566 --> 59:31.776
And you found this
in your grandfather's workshop?

59:31.818 --> 59:35.280
No, I found it hidden
in his attic.

59:36.322 --> 59:39.450
Okay. Guys, listen.

59:39.492 --> 59:41.994
We've got to be
very, very careful

59:42.037 --> 59:43.455
about how we handle this.

59:43.497 --> 59:45.207
I don't know if I believe
in the whole...

59:45.247 --> 59:47.833
legend of Eugene Burns thing.

59:47.876 --> 59:50.461
But what I do know
for a fact is...

59:50.503 --> 59:52.505
that a lot of death
has followed the people...

59:52.546 --> 59:54.465
that have heard him
play that guitar.

59:54.508 --> 59:58.845
Now, it could just
be coincidence or whatever...

59:58.887 --> 01:00:01.430
but I don't think
you should take that chance.

01:00:01.472 --> 01:00:03.933
Why don't you just
give it to me for the night

01:00:03.974 --> 01:00:05.810
and I'll do some research.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:06.895
And whatever you do,

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:09.105
stay the hell away
from that guitar.

01:00:10.523 --> 01:00:12.025
What do you think?

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:16.071
Honestly...

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:18.990
I think it's all bullshit.

01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:22.494
I don't think Eugene's ghost
is haunting you.

01:00:22.535 --> 01:00:24.371
I don't think
his possessed guitar

01:00:24.412 --> 01:00:25.956
is making you see things,

01:00:25.997 --> 01:00:29.626
but it wouldn't hurt to leave
the record here for the night.

01:00:29.668 --> 01:00:32.838
Maybe you'll actually
get a decent night's sleep.

01:00:32.878 --> 01:00:35.047
Yeah... Okay.

01:00:40.887 --> 01:00:43.055
Hey, man,
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:00:43.097 --> 01:00:44.515
Thanks, man.

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:48.645
Hey. Give me a call
if you need anything.

01:00:48.686 --> 01:00:50.438
Even if it's just to talk.

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:52.732
Okay, I will.

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:06.747
You okay?

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:11.126
Did you know my grandfather
was an exorcist?

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:16.006
No, I didn't.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.802
I think
he might've killed Eugene.

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:23.472
What?
You're kidding, right?

01:01:23.512 --> 01:01:24.764
Just forget it.

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:27.058
No, Mallory.
Talk to me.

01:01:30.479 --> 01:01:31.772
Why'd you leave?

01:01:32.981 --> 01:01:34.107
What?

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:36.401
Four years ago,

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:37.611
You left
without saying anything.

01:01:37.651 --> 01:01:39.070
You just disappeared.

01:01:39.111 --> 01:01:39.905
Why?

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:42.990
I just had some stuff
to work out.

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:44.241
What stuff?

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:48.537
I really don't wanna talk
about it.

01:01:48.579 --> 01:01:50.748
Was it because
you tried to kill yourself?

01:01:53.459 --> 01:01:54.753
Rodney?

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:57.756
Please drop it.

01:01:57.798 --> 01:02:00.258
You can tell me.
I want to know.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:05.305
What the fuck is it exactly
that you want to know, Mallory?

01:02:05.347 --> 01:02:07.432
That I fucking
tried to kill myself?

01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:10.227
Okay yes, I fucking tried
to kill myself.

01:02:10.267 --> 01:02:12.394
It happens.
What else?

01:02:12.436 --> 01:02:13.604
Why?

01:02:13.646 --> 01:02:16.107
It's none of your
fucking business why.

01:02:16.148 --> 01:02:17.858
I'm sorry.
I thought that we were...

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:20.779
We're friends?
Sure we're friends.

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.114
But that's all
we're ever gonna be.

01:02:23.155 --> 01:02:24.157
What else?

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:26.243
You don't wanna know
any more information

01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:27.494
about my personal life?

01:02:27.535 --> 01:02:29.871
You don't wanna know
how often I masturbate?

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:30.956
Fuck you.

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:32.165
Okay.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:48.597
Hey, do you want me to get you
some foo before I take off?

01:02:48.639 --> 01:02:50.015
Come check this out.

01:02:51.142 --> 01:02:53.352
It says here that Eugene
recorded "Ghost Note"

01:02:53.394 --> 01:02:57.983
in the summer of 1970 but the
original pressing was stolen.

01:02:58.023 --> 01:03:00.776
Charlie Taylor, the engineer,
claimed that...

01:03:00.818 --> 01:03:02.903
Eugene wanted to
release the record to the world

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:06.365
and he thought...
it would end humanity.

01:03:08.702 --> 01:03:10.871
He was suspected
of being the thief but...

01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:12.706
he was found ripped apart

01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:16.333
by what appeared to be
an animal attack in his home.

01:03:18.003 --> 01:03:20.671
It says here the record
was never found.

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:24.049
Wikipedia?

01:03:24.675 --> 01:03:27.011
Okay, so, sandwich?

01:03:27.052 --> 01:03:29.138
Sure. Thanks.

01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:36.188
Hey, don't listen to that, okay?

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:39.524
Why? You don't really
believe that...

01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:43.153
I just mean... don't listen
to it without me.

01:03:43.195 --> 01:03:44.361
Okay.

01:03:46.572 --> 01:03:48.074
I'll be right back.

01:05:15.996 --> 01:05:17.872
-I'm sorry.
-Forget it.

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:19.332
I shouldn't have snapped at you
like that.

01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:22.252
I shouldn't have been prying
into you personal life.

01:05:22.293 --> 01:05:24.754
No. No, you're right.

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:27.215
I do need to talk about it.

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:28.383
It's okay.

01:05:29.675 --> 01:05:32.386
We can talk about it
whenever you're ready.

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:36.390
See ya tomorrow, then?

01:05:38.392 --> 01:05:39.101
Yeah.

01:05:40.352 --> 01:05:43.063
I'm sure my grandma
is freaking out right now.

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:58.037
Hey Xander,
here's your sandwich!

01:05:59.747 --> 01:06:02.458
All right...
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:07.379
You said you weren't gonna
listen to it, you asshole.

01:06:10.883 --> 01:06:13.010
Xander? You here?

01:06:18.557 --> 01:06:20.059
Are you in there?

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:24.439
All right. I'm done.

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:27.818
What the fuck?! You jerk!

01:06:28.693 --> 01:06:31.446
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:36.992
Let go!
Xander, you're hurting me!

01:06:42.416 --> 01:06:44.501
Fucking asshole!

01:07:52.778 --> 01:07:54.321
I love you.

01:09:52.772 --> 01:09:54.398
You are the one!

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.911
I'm hungry.

01:10:05.951 --> 01:10:09.246
Mom, Vicky's hungry!

01:10:09.997 --> 01:10:11.832
Where's Mommy?

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:14.044
Is she gonna make dinner?

01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:16.963
She always makes dinner.

01:10:17.004 --> 01:10:19.048
Where is she?

01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:33.188
It's okay.
It's just thunder.

01:10:41.405 --> 01:10:42.531
Mama?

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:44.073
Are you in there?

01:10:47.119 --> 01:10:49.704
Wait. You ain't supposed
to go in there.

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:51.330
It's okay.

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:55.836
Mama?

01:11:01.006 --> 01:11:03.677
Mama?
Are you sleeping?

01:11:10.642 --> 01:11:12.184
Mama!

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:14.353
Mama!

01:11:32.914 --> 01:11:35.166
Just tell her,
you big pussy.

01:11:37.335 --> 01:11:40.172
All you have to do
is walk over there right now...

01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:42.215
and say, "Mallory...

01:11:42.256 --> 01:11:43.759
I'm in love with you.

01:11:44.759 --> 01:11:45.885
I've always been
in love with you,

01:11:45.927 --> 01:11:47.262
and I can't stand the thought

01:11:47.304 --> 01:11:49.639
of being without you
for one more second."

01:11:57.522 --> 01:11:58.814
You can do this.

01:12:48.823 --> 01:12:50.032
No, no, no!

01:12:50.075 --> 01:12:51.576
We have to hide!

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:22.333
Go away!

01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:28.090
Please stop!

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:39.101
What do you want from me?!

01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:41.603
I just wanted
to make sure your okay.

01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:44.522
Fuck, man!

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:46.942
No, no, no.
It's that one.

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:48.317
-Sure?
-Yes.

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:50.486
Fuck. It's locked.

01:14:50.528 --> 01:14:52.321
Let's go ask Mallory
for the key.

01:14:52.363 --> 01:14:53.948
Are you kidding me?

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.450
See if we can find a rock.

01:15:28.525 --> 01:15:31.277
Thanks for letting
me sleep with you.

01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:35.322
Sure, honey.
Thunder can be scary.

01:15:39.911 --> 01:15:41.496
It's not the thunder.

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:44.457
What's got you spooked, then?

01:15:46.168 --> 01:15:48.003
I need to tell you something.

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:09.023
What are we looking for,
Xander?

01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:17.615
This is ridiculous.

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:19.284
I'm gonna go get Mallory.

01:16:19.326 --> 01:16:20.577
Wait.

01:16:21.202 --> 01:16:22.870
Don't you move.

01:16:26.457 --> 01:16:27.709
Are you serious?

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:29.794
You know he's immortal,
don't you?

01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:30.836
Who?

01:16:31.254 --> 01:16:32.839
Eugene, man.

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.048
Where have you been?

01:16:35.092 --> 01:16:38.344
Yeah, I get it.

01:16:38.385 --> 01:16:40.304
He lives through his music.

01:16:40.347 --> 01:16:41.723
No.

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:43.015
He's alive.

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:45.684
And you and I...

01:16:45.727 --> 01:16:48.729
well, we're gonna
set him free.

01:16:50.482 --> 01:16:52.234
I think you're losing it,
Xander.

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:53.902
I gotta go.

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:54.861
Hold on a second.

01:16:54.902 --> 01:16:56.570
I need to
show you something first.

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:57.988
This is getting old.

01:16:58.031 --> 01:16:59.448
Just give me two seconds.

01:16:59.491 --> 01:17:01.618
Fine.
What do you want to show me?

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:05.580
I've already seen it.

01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:10.252
You are gonna love this.

01:17:10.293 --> 01:17:12.545
What are you doing?

01:17:12.586 --> 01:17:15.256
Great, Xander.
You ruined Mallory's record.

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:16.758
Look.

01:17:17.425 --> 01:17:20.719
Not one single scratch.

01:17:21.804 --> 01:17:23.013
You see...

01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:24.433
It's unbreakable.

01:17:26.768 --> 01:17:28.061
Okay...

01:17:29.019 --> 01:17:30.981
So it's unbreakable. Big deal.

01:17:31.731 --> 01:17:34.192
Don't you get it, man?

01:17:34.233 --> 01:17:36.736
They're both unbreakable.

01:17:37.403 --> 01:17:39.613
Invincible. Immortal.

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:44.744
Is there some sort of medication
you forgot to take today?

01:17:44.786 --> 01:17:46.037
No, Man.

01:17:48.999 --> 01:17:50.500
Check this out.

01:17:51.918 --> 01:17:52.835
See this?

01:17:53.461 --> 01:17:56.881
Eugene is in here, man...

01:17:56.923 --> 01:17:59.550
and we're gonna
break him out.

01:17:59.593 --> 01:18:02.053
Here. Take this.

01:18:03.138 --> 01:18:04.890
Break the bricks.

01:18:09.728 --> 01:18:11.104
Well, hit the wall.

01:18:11.729 --> 01:18:13.147
So you're telling me...

01:18:14.732 --> 01:18:16.776
that Eugene Burns
is not dead...

01:18:17.777 --> 01:18:19.862
but he's actually immortal...

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:22.406
and buried inside the wall

01:18:22.448 --> 01:18:23.909
of Mallory's
grandfather's workshop,

01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:28.412
and we need to break down
the wall and set him free?

01:18:28.455 --> 01:18:29.747
I knew you'd get it.

01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:31.792
Fuck off, Xander.
I'm going home.

01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:36.379
A séance?

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:37.838
My God, Mallory.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:41.425
You have no idea the powers
we're dealing with here.

01:18:41.468 --> 01:18:44.720
I know.
I am so, so sorry.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:48.140
Did anyone touch him?

01:18:49.976 --> 01:18:51.268
Him?

01:18:51.311 --> 01:18:54.939
The guitar, Mallory.
Did you touch it?

01:18:57.817 --> 01:18:59.568
I've been seeing things.

01:18:59.611 --> 01:19:01.405
I know, honey.

01:19:01.446 --> 01:19:04.448
Astaroth is not just a guitar.

01:19:04.491 --> 01:19:08.245
It's cursed
with demonic powers.

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.622
Why is it in still
up in your attic?

01:19:11.665 --> 01:19:13.542
Why the hell did you not
burn it, or something?

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:16.210
Believe me, we tried.

01:19:16.253 --> 01:19:18.671
It's indestructible.

01:19:20.339 --> 01:19:21.967
We were going to bury it...

01:19:22.008 --> 01:19:24.678
but Milton was afraid
someone would find it

01:19:24.719 --> 01:19:27.264
and Eugene would be freed.

01:19:27.304 --> 01:19:30.892
But... Eugene is dead.

01:19:48.367 --> 01:19:50.620
Come on out.
She's gone.

01:19:57.544 --> 01:19:59.211
Ashley, no!

01:20:14.393 --> 01:20:15.728
He's free.

01:20:24.237 --> 01:20:26.031
Hey Lilith, It's Rodney.

01:20:27.365 --> 01:20:28.532
I'm not sure what you can do,

01:20:28.575 --> 01:20:30.994
but Xander's been
acting really strange.

01:20:32.954 --> 01:20:35.999
I can't believe
this is happening again.

01:20:39.753 --> 01:20:42.214
But if you're not trying
to free Eugene...

01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:44.548
then that means
you haven't heard it.

01:20:46.009 --> 01:20:47.094
Heard what?

01:20:47.594 --> 01:20:49.137
Ghost Note.

01:20:49.179 --> 01:20:50.680
Eugene's record?

01:20:51.388 --> 01:20:52.807
You've heard of it?

01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:56.352
We found it in Grandpa's shop.

01:20:56.393 --> 01:20:57.728
No.

01:20:57.771 --> 01:20:58.938
What?

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:01.316
Where is it?

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:02.566
What? The record?

01:21:02.608 --> 01:21:03.901
Yes, goddamn it, Mallory!

01:21:03.943 --> 01:21:06.321
The fucking record,
where is it?

01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:08.447
We took it to a record shop.

01:21:08.490 --> 01:21:10.700
Okay, we have to
get it back now.

01:21:17.374 --> 01:21:18.875
Maybe they went away.

01:21:21.044 --> 01:21:22.379
I have a gun!

01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:25.131
Mallory, it's Rodney!
Will you let me in?

01:21:29.803 --> 01:21:31.430
What the hell, Rodney?!

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:34.265
I'm sorry. I need to tell you
about Xander.

01:22:26.985 --> 01:22:28.987
He's out there right now?

01:22:29.028 --> 01:22:29.653
Yeah.

01:22:29.696 --> 01:22:31.031
He said something about...

01:22:31.072 --> 01:22:35.242
Eugene being immortal,
and he was gonna let him out.

01:22:35.285 --> 01:22:36.536
Crazy?

01:22:36.577 --> 01:22:37.829
We need to stop him.

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:39.997
I'm sure we can fix
whatever he damages.

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:41.957
You don't understand, Rodney.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.377
If Eugene gets out...

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:47.214
we're all going to die.

01:23:20.121 --> 01:23:21.497
I'm here to serve you.

01:23:35.262 --> 01:23:36.138
-Run!
-What?

01:23:36.179 --> 01:23:37.931
Don't let him get to Astaroth!

01:23:37.973 --> 01:23:39.515
Take her out of here. Go!

01:23:39.558 --> 01:23:41.518
-Mallory!
-Go!

01:23:50.443 --> 01:23:52.320
He needs me!
Put me the fuck down!

01:23:52.362 --> 01:23:54.156
Shut up!
I'm trying to save you!

01:23:54.196 --> 01:23:55.114
Fuck!

01:23:55.156 --> 01:23:57.784
What the fuck, Rodney!
Where's Xander?

01:23:57.826 --> 01:23:59.369
There's no time to explain.
Let's go.

01:23:59.411 --> 01:24:01.246
Let me go!

01:24:04.707 --> 01:24:05.791
What is wrong with her?

01:24:05.834 --> 01:24:07.294
I don't know.
She saw Eugene and...

01:24:07.335 --> 01:24:09.463
What do you mean,
she saw Eugene?

01:24:09.504 --> 01:24:11.631
He's going to kill you all.

01:24:11.673 --> 01:24:13.550
What the fuck's
going on, Rodney?

01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:44.455
Hotdog needs to go for a walk.

01:24:44.497 --> 01:24:46.165
So take him. I'm busy.

01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:51.213
All you do is play
with those damn guns all day.

01:24:51.254 --> 01:24:53.715
It's your job
to take him outside.

01:24:53.756 --> 01:24:54.883
Christ.

01:24:54.924 --> 01:24:56.592
Don't you use the Lord's name
in vain!

01:24:56.634 --> 01:24:59.637
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
That's all you ever do!

01:24:59.679 --> 01:25:01.306
Makes me wanna...

01:25:12.526 --> 01:25:13.610
Hey, goddamn!

01:25:13.652 --> 01:25:16.279
I told you not to talk
that Spanish around me.

01:25:16.321 --> 01:25:18.615
You know I don't understand
that shit.

01:25:18.656 --> 01:25:20.491
You're a fucking asshole!

01:25:27.749 --> 01:25:30.626
Say hello to my little friend.

01:25:38.009 --> 01:25:38.844
This is too crazy.

01:25:38.884 --> 01:25:40.219
I know.

01:25:40.262 --> 01:25:42.514
I wouldn't have believe it
either if I hadn't seen it.

01:25:46.893 --> 01:25:48.520
We need to call the police.

01:25:48.562 --> 01:25:49.646
I guess so.

01:25:49.687 --> 01:25:51.730
Sure, call the police.

01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:53.441
They can arrest him.

01:25:55.568 --> 01:25:57.070
What are you doing?

01:25:57.112 --> 01:25:59.197
Maybe she's right.
I mean, what can they do?

01:25:59.238 --> 01:26:01.991
We let him out,
we have to put him back.

01:26:02.032 --> 01:26:04.119
What are we supposed to do?

01:26:04.995 --> 01:26:06.496
I know what we can do...

01:26:07.872 --> 01:26:09.165
Die.

01:26:12.210 --> 01:26:13.378
Mallory's grandmother said

01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:15.380
that Eugene would want
to get to the guitar.

01:26:15.421 --> 01:26:16.464
Astaroth.

01:26:17.424 --> 01:26:18.967
Maybe we can beat Eugene there.

01:26:19.009 --> 01:26:21.386
Get to it first,
then lure him into a trap.

01:26:22.304 --> 01:26:24.556
That's a great idea, Rodney

01:26:24.598 --> 01:26:26.265
You're so smart.

01:26:30.103 --> 01:26:31.855
Where is it?

01:26:31.897 --> 01:26:33.273
It's in her attic.

01:26:37.611 --> 01:26:39.028
Great.

01:26:42.448 --> 01:26:44.576
All right, just hurry it up,
you mangy mutt.

01:26:51.165 --> 01:26:54.335
I don't know why we bother
walking you, anyway.

01:26:54.376 --> 01:26:56.588
You're still gonna shit
in the house.

01:27:06.639 --> 01:27:07.807
Who's there?!

01:27:21.321 --> 01:27:23.490
You're just not gonna go,
are you?

01:27:29.995 --> 01:27:31.330
Who is that?

01:27:32.290 --> 01:27:33.707
Ricky?

01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:35.001
That you, man?

01:27:38.839 --> 01:27:40.506
All right, mister.

01:27:40.549 --> 01:27:41.758
You best stay back.

01:27:45.053 --> 01:27:46.847
I ain't fuckin' around!

01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:59.860
Wait, so she's the only one
that knows where it's at?

01:28:03.028 --> 01:28:05.072
She needs to snap out of it.

01:28:11.204 --> 01:28:12.539
Why'd you hit me?

01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:13.873
-Mallory?
-What?

01:28:13.915 --> 01:28:15.500
Are you back to normal?

01:28:15.541 --> 01:28:17.043
My face hurts.

01:28:17.085 --> 01:28:18.628
Can you take us to the guitar?

01:28:21.839 --> 01:28:22.965
What was that?

01:28:23.008 --> 01:28:24.675
Sounded like a gunshot.

01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:27.012
Come on, let's go.

01:29:14.308 --> 01:29:15.726
What are you doing?

01:29:15.768 --> 01:29:17.061
Are you okay?

01:29:17.103 --> 01:29:19.563
Yeah, I just thought
I saw something.

01:29:19.606 --> 01:29:20.816
It's nothing.

01:29:21.942 --> 01:29:23.276
Let's go inside.

01:29:32.451 --> 01:29:33.786
Wait here.
Keep an eye out.

01:29:33.829 --> 01:29:34.787
We'll be right back.

01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:36.415
Okay, just hurry up.

01:29:47.592 --> 01:29:48.593
Rodney?

01:29:48.634 --> 01:29:49.635
Hang on!

01:29:51.388 --> 01:29:52.389
I'm right here.

01:29:54.307 --> 01:29:57.561
Come on,
come on, come on.

01:30:01.982 --> 01:30:02.983
Where is it?

01:30:03.858 --> 01:30:05.317
It's hiding back here.

01:30:12.159 --> 01:30:13.492
Are you okay?

01:30:14.911 --> 01:30:15.954
It's in there.

01:30:33.179 --> 01:30:34.472
What's going on up there?

01:30:34.513 --> 01:30:35.890
We're okay!

01:30:47.861 --> 01:30:49.153
Don't open it.

01:30:49.196 --> 01:30:50.572
It's okay.

01:31:27.901 --> 01:31:29.318
It's beautiful.

01:31:29.361 --> 01:31:31.028
Close it, please.

01:31:32.531 --> 01:31:33.615
Okay.

01:31:54.885 --> 01:31:56.470
What was that for?

01:31:56.513 --> 01:31:57.764
I don't know.

01:32:00.099 --> 01:32:01.767
Let's end this.

01:32:05.897 --> 01:32:07.232
Where the heck is Lilith?

01:32:07.273 --> 01:32:08.691
Maybe she's in the bathroom.

01:32:11.236 --> 01:32:12.571
Lilith?

01:32:12.612 --> 01:32:13.613
Lilith!

01:32:24.124 --> 01:32:25.332
-Run!
-What?

01:32:25.375 --> 01:32:26.543
Go!

01:32:41.433 --> 01:32:43.560
Shit.

01:33:30.147 --> 01:33:31.315
The well!

01:34:11.814 --> 01:34:12.773
Easy.

01:34:37.465 --> 01:34:38.883
Get that motherfucker.

01:35:17.798 --> 01:35:18.799
Fuck.

01:35:19.465 --> 01:35:22.052
I don't know... where...

01:35:56.710 --> 01:35:58.088
Mallory!

01:38:12.472 --> 01:38:13.723
Rodney!

01:38:14.974 --> 01:38:16.809
Rodney, snap out of it!

01:38:18.186 --> 01:38:19.854
Thank God.

01:38:20.688 --> 01:38:22.982
I've always loved you, Mallory.

01:38:23.023 --> 01:38:24.151
I know.

01:38:25.527 --> 01:38:27.112
Run, Mallory.

01:38:27.153 --> 01:38:28.112
-What?
-Run!

01:38:31.282 --> 01:38:32.491
Rodney!

01:38:34.411 --> 01:38:35.704
Please, Mallory!

01:38:46.839 --> 01:38:50.177
Blood of my blood,
spirits of love...

01:38:50.218 --> 01:38:52.429
come from below
and from above.

01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:54.555
Entities loving,
who wish me well,

01:38:54.598 --> 01:38:56.850
return this demon back to hell!

01:39:01.062 --> 01:39:04.649
God the lord,
the strength of my salvation,

01:39:04.691 --> 01:39:06.401
thou hast covered my head
on the day of battle.

01:39:06.442 --> 01:39:07.526
Wait, no!

01:39:07.568 --> 01:39:09.361
Let them be cast
into the fire...

01:39:12.198 --> 01:39:17.204
into deep pits, Lord,
that they rise not up again!

01:39:17.245 --> 01:39:19.706
I will be back!

01:39:30.925 --> 01:39:32.343
Let's get out of here.
