No noodle.

00:52.657 --> 00:53.726
I ain't holding the side.

See? I'm swimming.

00:54.996 --> 00:56.600
Swimming all by myself.

here.

00:59.506 --> 01:00.682
I'm -- oh, no.

01:00.716 --> 01:04.425
Now I'm drowning!

01:04.458 --> 01:07.364
I'm starting to go --

01:07.397 --> 01:08.801
I can't breathe!

01:12.042 --> 01:14.080

01:15.483 --> 01:16.753
That's good. Keep going.

01:16.786 --> 01:17.989
I knew you could do it.

01:18.022 --> 01:20.361
Meatwad:

01:20.394 --> 01:21.096
hey, dang it!

01:21.129 --> 01:22.933
Get your head out of that dang

01:22.967 --> 01:23.569
phone!

01:23.602 --> 01:25.038
I almost died back there!

01:26.542 --> 01:28.681
Frylock: Yeah. Cool.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.551
Meatwad: Fine.

01:38.670 --> 01:40.875
All right. Pick up the phone.

01:40.909 --> 01:42.546
Pick up the phone.

01:42.579 --> 01:43.982
He's screening me.

01:44.016 --> 01:46.688
Don't you be screening me!

01:46.722 --> 01:47.657
Hey --

01:47.690 --> 01:53.081
Frylock: Wazzu-u-u-u-u-u-u-p?

01:53.872 --> 01:55.609
If you need to leave a message,

01:55.643 --> 01:57.012
just do so after the beep.

01:57.748 --> 01:59.518
Meatwad: Hey, I almost died

01:59.552 --> 02:00.795
in that pool over here.

02:00.828 --> 02:01.763
Next to you.

02:01.797 --> 02:03.767
So hit me back on my celly,

02:03.802 --> 02:05.872
'cause I want to yell at you.

02:05.906 --> 02:07.576
And talk about dinner.

02:07.610 --> 02:08.846
All right, later.

02:08.878 --> 02:09.882
Frylock: Yeah. Awesome.

02:09.916 --> 02:11.050
Master Shake: Your son is

02:11.084 --> 02:11.620
drowning.

02:11.653 --> 02:12.555
Meatwad: He knows.

02:12.588 --> 02:13.557
I left him a voicemail.

02:13.590 --> 02:14.727
Master Shake: And you just

02:14.760 --> 02:15.729
sit there like a zombie

02:15.762 --> 02:17.900
zoned...In on...

02:17.933 --> 02:19.170
That looks fun. What is it?

02:19.203 --> 02:20.673
Frylock: Look, look, look.

02:20.707 --> 02:22.044
When I do this, he tap dances.

02:22.077 --> 02:24.081
Master Shake: No way. Wow!

02:24.114 --> 02:25.184
Frylock: Yeah, check this

02:25.217 --> 02:25.752
out.

02:27.055 --> 02:28.124
Master Shake:

02:28.158 --> 02:29.026
who thinks of that?

02:29.060 --> 02:30.463
Meatwad: Can someone fetch me

02:30.496 --> 02:32.568
my towel?

02:32.601 --> 02:34.739
Oh. Oh, thank you.

02:34.773 --> 02:35.407
Magical chair.

02:35.441 --> 02:36.242
Master Shake: Hey, do the

02:36.276 --> 02:37.512
salamander and put him in those

02:37.545 --> 02:38.214
cute little boots.

02:38.247 --> 02:39.149
Frylock: Nah, check it out.

02:39.183 --> 02:39.885
It's a chipmunk.

02:39.918 --> 02:40.753
And when I shake it --

02:40.787 --> 02:41.822
Master Shake: No, if you keep

02:41.855 --> 02:42.825
shaking, he does a somersault.

02:42.858 --> 02:43.659
Here, let me show you.

02:43.694 --> 02:44.696
Frylock: No, no, no, no, no.

02:44.729 --> 02:45.564
Don't shake it too much.

02:45.598 --> 02:46.165
Master Shake: Aah!

02:46.199 --> 02:47.067
Frylock: I told you!

02:47.101 --> 02:48.270
Now I got to go back to tadpole

02:48.304 --> 02:48.972
stage, man.

02:49.006 --> 02:50.141
Master Shake: Let me hold it

02:50.175 --> 02:51.578
while you do it, but I'll do the

02:51.612 --> 02:52.279
left button.

02:52.313 --> 02:53.148
Meatwad: Y'all see all this

02:53.181 --> 02:54.184
stuff just floating around?

02:54.218 --> 02:55.220
Master Shake: Will you shut

02:55.253 --> 02:55.855
up?!

02:55.888 --> 02:56.724
We're trying to make this

02:56.757 --> 02:57.792
salamander square dance, and

02:57.826 --> 02:58.794
your sound vibrations are

02:58.828 --> 02:59.663
altering the program.

02:59.696 --> 03:00.606
Frylock: Who are you talking

03:00.639 --> 03:01.174
to?

03:01.207 --> 03:01.775
Meatwad: Me, dumbass.

03:01.808 --> 03:02.443
I'm over here.

03:02.477 --> 03:03.111
Frylock: Oh.

03:03.144 --> 03:03.880
Well, ain't you doing a good

03:03.913 --> 03:04.548
job?

03:04.582 --> 03:05.484
You keep on paddling, buddy.

03:05.517 --> 03:06.619
Meatwad: Fine. I'm gone.

03:06.653 --> 03:07.622
Frylock: Great.

03:07.655 --> 03:08.691
I'm so proud of you.

03:09.794 --> 03:10.596
swim upstream.

03:10.629 --> 03:11.831
Crocodile, 3:00! Look out!

03:11.865 --> 03:13.468
Master Shake: Ooh, what's the

03:13.502 --> 03:14.170
red battery mean?

03:14.204 --> 03:14.972
Frylock: We're running out of

03:15.006 --> 03:15.673
battery juice.

03:15.707 --> 03:16.710
We got to find an outlet, quick.

03:16.743 --> 03:17.678
Master Shake: Text Meatwad

03:17.712 --> 03:18.680
to bring an extension cord over

03:18.714 --> 03:20.552
here.

03:20.585 --> 03:21.855
Do you have another phone we can

03:21.888 --> 03:22.423
do that?

03:22.456 --> 03:23.191
Frylock: Too late.

03:23.225 --> 03:24.494
Master Shake: Damn it!

03:24.528 --> 03:25.864
Always to me! Always!

03:25.897 --> 03:27.936
We were this close to getting to

03:27.969 --> 03:29.004
the kangarilla.

03:29.038 --> 03:31.009
Your phone sucks.

03:31.043 --> 03:32.546
Now it doesn't suck.

03:32.579 --> 03:34.551
But your mobile device does not

03:34.584 --> 03:36.188
allow me for the mobility I

03:36.221 --> 03:36.922
prefer.

03:36.956 --> 03:38.125
I need to -- ohh, I got the

03:38.159 --> 03:38.827
ruby!

03:38.861 --> 03:39.896
Frylock: Double-ruby bonus.

03:39.929 --> 03:41.232
Master Shake: Yeah, brother!

03:41.266 --> 03:42.770
Meatwad: Check it out, y'all.

03:42.803 --> 03:44.039
I put my shoes on and now I'm

03:44.073 --> 03:46.745
standing on the chair cushion.

03:46.779 --> 03:47.882
And plus the chair is haunted.

03:47.915 --> 03:48.850
Frylock: Good, good.

03:48.884 --> 03:49.952
Get those food pellets, man.

03:49.986 --> 03:51.055
Master Shake: I thought I did

03:51.089 --> 03:51.623
it!

03:51.656 --> 03:52.292
It didn't go, though!

03:52.325 --> 03:53.595
Frylock: Feed the dragon.

03:53.628 --> 03:54.296
Calm him down.

03:54.329 --> 03:55.232
Take him to the store, put him

03:55.265 --> 03:56.602
in some new clothes for school.

03:56.635 --> 03:57.670
Master Shake: He needs a

03:57.704 --> 03:58.339
cable-knit sweater.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.609
Frylock: Yeah, that's it.

03:59.642 --> 04:00.651
Master Shake: This game is

04:00.684 --> 04:01.286
incredible!

04:01.319 --> 04:02.020
Meatwad: Look at that!

04:02.054 --> 04:03.223
Someone's writing something on

04:03.257 --> 04:04.225
the wall now.

04:04.259 --> 04:04.894
In blood.

04:04.927 --> 04:05.929
Frylock: Meatwad.

04:05.963 --> 04:07.567
Go play in your room, okay, and

04:07.600 --> 04:08.736
let Frylock do his work.

04:08.770 --> 04:09.973
Master Shake: Double axel

04:10.006 --> 04:10.774
with a twist!

04:10.807 --> 04:11.609
You're insane!

04:11.642 --> 04:12.912
Frylock: You just wait till

04:12.945 --> 04:13.948
we get to the tarantula.

04:13.982 --> 04:14.850
It's totally nuts.

04:14.884 --> 04:16.019
You have no control, man.

04:16.053 --> 04:17.824
Ooooh!

04:17.857 --> 04:19.995
Ooooooooh!

04:20.029 --> 04:22.000
Look at me-e-e-e-e.

04:22.033 --> 04:24.038
I'm a gho-o-o-o-st.

04:24.071 --> 04:25.073
Meatwad: Frylock...

04:25.107 --> 04:26.940
Frylock: Turn the tv down, okay?

04:26.978 --> 04:27.646
Guy?

04:27.679 --> 04:28.682
Master Shake: Yeah, we can't

04:28.716 --> 04:29.818
hear the theme to this game.

04:29.851 --> 04:31.823
Banging the po-o-o-t!

04:31.856 --> 04:33.726
What the he-e-e-ll?

04:33.760 --> 04:36.199
There's only one po-o-o-o-t.

04:36.232 --> 04:37.703
He-e-e-e-y!

04:37.736 --> 04:40.208
Look over he-e-e-e-e-re!

04:40.242 --> 04:42.012
Look at me-e-e-e-e!

04:42.047 --> 04:43.817
Master Shake: Meatwad, will

04:43.851 --> 04:45.320
you get shake his earbuds?

04:45.354 --> 04:46.122
Thank you.

04:46.156 --> 04:47.124
Hey!

04:47.158 --> 04:49.129
How about no-o-o-w?

04:49.163 --> 04:50.332
Blood! Blo-o-o-od!

04:50.366 --> 04:51.434
Frylock: Damn.

04:51.468 --> 04:53.038
Master Shake: Cool...

04:53.072 --> 04:54.241
Graphics.

04:54.275 --> 04:56.446
I feel a sensation around my

04:56.480 --> 04:58.049
one, thick ankle.

04:58.084 --> 05:00.188
Frylock: Okay, whatever.

05:00.221 --> 05:01.364
Fi-i-i-ne.

05:01.397 --> 05:03.101
Get a load of thi-i-i-i-s!

05:03.135 --> 05:04.772
Master Shake: Aaah!

05:04.805 --> 05:06.042
These buttons are sticking.

05:06.075 --> 05:07.044
Frylock: Come on!

05:07.077 --> 05:08.113
Play through the pain.

05:08.147 --> 05:09.851
Ooooooooooh!

05:09.884 --> 05:10.886
Ugh, can you

05:10.919 --> 05:11.855
please get their attention?

05:11.888 --> 05:12.891
Meatwad: Shoot, boy, I've

05:12.924 --> 05:13.559
been trying.

05:13.592 --> 05:14.996
I mean, usually when I want

05:15.029 --> 05:16.833
attention, I threaten suicide.

05:16.867 --> 05:18.270
And then I get ice cream.

05:18.303 --> 05:20.107
Go-o-o-od

05:20.140 --> 05:21.077
ide-e-e-e-e-a!

05:21.110 --> 05:22.145
Meatwad: Hey, y'all.

05:22.179 --> 05:22.947
My life sucks.

05:22.981 --> 05:24.317
I ain't got nothing to live for,

05:24.350 --> 05:25.453
and I'm gonna end it now.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.799
Pop off a couple

05:30.832 --> 05:32.168
ro-o-o-o-o-unds.

05:35.142 --> 05:37.380
Meatwad: I'm so...Angry at

05:37.414 --> 05:38.282
myself.

05:38.316 --> 05:39.285
I'm so depressed.

05:39.319 --> 05:41.023
He's se-e-e-e-riou-u-u-u-s!

05:41.056 --> 05:42.760
Meatwad: And, uh, I'm gonna

05:42.793 --> 05:44.196
just end the suffering right

05:44.230 --> 05:45.065
now.

05:52.515 --> 05:54.487
Oh, well, I missed.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.356
Got to reload now.

05:55.389 --> 05:56.558
It's not

05:56.591 --> 05:57.126
working.

05:57.160 --> 05:58.095
Meatwad: Screw it.

05:58.128 --> 06:00.273
Just blow up the house, man.

06:04.182 --> 06:05.051
Frylock: Damn it!

06:05.084 --> 06:06.321
I signed a two-year contract for

06:06.354 --> 06:07.023
that thing.

06:07.056 --> 06:08.191
Master Shake: Piece of crap.

06:08.225 --> 06:09.862
Send it back to China.

06:09.895 --> 06:11.298
It blew up our house.

06:11.332 --> 06:13.403
Frylock: Aw, man, what are we

06:13.437 --> 06:14.440
gonna do now?

06:14.473 --> 06:15.743
W-with our free time?

06:15.776 --> 06:17.012
Master Shake: Let's get

06:17.046 --> 06:18.415
together and stare at my hand.

06:18.449 --> 06:20.353
And harken back to the days when

06:20.386 --> 06:21.957
we played that cool game.

06:21.990 --> 06:22.992
What up, yo?

06:23.025 --> 06:24.095
Frylock: A ghost!

06:24.128 --> 06:25.130
Master Shake: A gay-st.

06:25.164 --> 06:26.032
Meatwad: I told you.

06:26.066 --> 06:27.135
I've been telling you for like

06:27.169 --> 06:27.871
10 minutes, man.

06:27.904 --> 06:28.538
I am

06:28.572 --> 06:29.207
from --

06:29.240 --> 06:30.342
Look, can I

06:30.376 --> 06:31.111
talk normal now?

06:31.144 --> 06:32.214
Frylock: Yeah. I guess.

06:32.247 --> 06:33.383
I'm from Smiley Junction.

06:33.416 --> 06:34.552
Frylock: Smiley Junction?

06:34.586 --> 06:35.254
Don't you mean

06:35.288 --> 06:36.190
Three-Arm Junction?

06:36.223 --> 06:37.359
Meatwad: Three-Arm Junction?

06:37.393 --> 06:38.060
What is that?

06:38.094 --> 06:39.230
Frylock: Well, I'll tell you,

06:39.263 --> 06:41.234
Meatwad.

06:41.268 --> 06:43.974
It was a model community, the

06:44.008 --> 06:45.878
city of the future.

06:45.912 --> 06:48.117
Until one day, the U.S. Military

06:48.150 --> 06:50.188
accidentally tested a nuclear

06:50.222 --> 06:51.190
bomb there.

06:51.225 --> 06:52.460
Wait. That's not Hawaii.

06:57.505 --> 06:59.008
Frylock: President Truman

06:59.043 --> 07:00.386
surrounded Smiley Junction with

07:00.419 --> 07:02.857
walls of lead 3-feet thick and

07:02.891 --> 07:03.860
100-feet high.

07:03.894 --> 07:06.934
Nothing could get in or out.

07:06.967 --> 07:09.874
And everyone died.

07:09.908 --> 07:11.143
Yeah, that was my story.

07:11.177 --> 07:12.413
I was gonna tell it to you,

07:12.446 --> 07:13.081
but --

07:13.115 --> 07:14.251
Master Shake: I'm sorry.

07:14.284 --> 07:15.019
I wasn't listening.

07:15.052 --> 07:15.721
What's up, now?

07:15.754 --> 07:16.824
Frylock: Get your face out of

07:16.857 --> 07:17.458
your hands.

07:17.491 --> 07:18.160
He's a ghost, shake. Okay?

07:18.193 --> 07:19.229
Master Shake: Go back to the

07:19.262 --> 07:19.796
beginning.

07:19.830 --> 07:20.498
Just do it all again.

07:20.532 --> 07:22.302
Frylock: So why are you here?

07:22.336 --> 07:23.539
Those lead walls.

07:23.572 --> 07:25.209
They kept out all the cellphone

07:25.243 --> 07:25.945
signals.

07:25.978 --> 07:27.548
Frylock: Which kill ghosts.

07:27.581 --> 07:30.087
Of course!

07:30.120 --> 07:30.989
They do?

07:31.022 --> 07:32.259
I didn't know that.

07:32.292 --> 07:33.428
Frylock: Yeah.

07:33.462 --> 07:34.497
I'm pretty sure.

07:34.530 --> 07:36.168
So anyway, what do you want?

07:36.201 --> 07:38.005
We just wanted to order pizza

07:38.038 --> 07:39.175
and chinese takeout.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.611
And we have no way of ordering

07:40.644 --> 07:41.313
it.

07:41.346 --> 07:42.583
Frylock: Uh, you could use a

07:42.616 --> 07:43.285
landline.

07:43.318 --> 07:44.520
We thought of that, but

07:44.554 --> 07:46.157
look -- the phone company won't

07:46.191 --> 07:47.294
come in and install it.

07:47.327 --> 07:48.998
But now that you say that they

07:49.031 --> 07:50.100
kill ghosts, well...

07:50.133 --> 07:51.604
Well, then we want you guys to

07:51.637 --> 07:53.341
organize a benefit and get that

07:53.374 --> 07:54.978
meat loaf to perform and sing

07:55.012 --> 07:56.247
some songs, right, about

07:56.281 --> 07:57.684
cellphones and how they kill

07:57.718 --> 07:59.287
ghosts and how people should

07:59.322 --> 08:00.497
return to the telegraph.

08:00.530 --> 08:02.134
Frylock: Why don't you just

08:02.168 --> 08:03.905
open your own pizza place, okay?

08:03.938 --> 08:05.542
That'll solve everything, right?

08:05.576 --> 08:08.082
Oh.

08:08.115 --> 08:10.453
Hmm.

08:10.487 --> 08:13.861
Good idea.

08:13.895 --> 08:15.465
Meatwad: What about the other

08:15.499 --> 08:16.066
thing?

08:16.100 --> 08:17.336
The benefit concert with

08:17.369 --> 08:18.105
meat loaf?

08:18.138 --> 08:19.541
Yeah, well, that's just

08:19.574 --> 08:21.312
something I'd like to do, at,

08:21.345 --> 08:22.381
well, some point.

08:22.415 --> 08:23.651
I mean --

08:23.684 --> 08:25.889
I mean, do y'all know anybody?

08:25.923 --> 08:27.593
Anyone who knows meat loaf?

08:27.627 --> 08:29.030
Carl: Meatloaf?

08:29.063 --> 08:30.166
Funny story, man.

08:30.199 --> 08:31.970
My, uh, second cousin Denise

08:32.003 --> 08:33.506
gave him a hand job backstage

08:33.541 --> 08:34.977
after the Newark show.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.413
Yeah, she got a couple kids now,

08:36.447 --> 08:38.051
so she doesn't tell the story as

08:38.083 --> 08:39.354
much, but every time we get

08:39.386 --> 08:41.058
together at Thanksgiving, I'm

08:41.091 --> 08:42.626
like, "tell the story, Denise,

08:42.662 --> 08:44.365
about how when you gave a hand

08:44.399 --> 08:45.434
job to Meatloaf."

08:45.468 --> 08:47.172
She was good-looking when she

08:47.205 --> 08:47.673
was 18.

08:47.706 --> 08:48.742
She's a blimp now.

08:48.776 --> 08:50.011
Wait a minute.

08:50.045 --> 08:51.348
That's not a cellphone.

08:51.382 --> 08:53.553
Wait, no!

08:53.587 --> 08:54.655
Master Shake: Carl.

08:54.689 --> 08:56.226
Do you have kangarilla on that

08:56.259 --> 08:56.860
phone?

08:56.894 --> 08:58.063
Carl: Hang on a second.

08:58.097 --> 08:59.466
Denise, hey, you still got

08:59.500 --> 09:00.609
Meatloaf's number?

09:00.643 --> 09:02.347
Yeah, from that time you gave

09:02.380 --> 09:03.349
him a hand job.

09:05.254 --> 09:07.324
You gave the bass player a hand

09:07.359 --> 09:08.962
job at the same time?

09:08.995 --> 09:10.666
Oh, wait, no. I believe it.

09:10.699 --> 09:11.601
You are a whore.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.105
What up,

09:13.138 --> 09:13.639
yo-o-o-o-o!

09:13.673 --> 09:14.708
I'm the gho-o-o-st!

09:14.742 --> 09:16.279
Carl: It's about respect.

09:16.312 --> 09:17.983
Not just for yourself, but for

09:18.016 --> 09:20.321
Meatloaf.

09:20.354 --> 09:21.457
I'm the gho-o-o-st of the

09:21.491 --> 09:22.560
gho-o-o-st that was just --

09:22.594 --> 09:23.462
Carl: You've heard

09:23.496 --> 09:24.464
"Bat Out of Hell," right?

09:24.498 --> 09:25.634
Is that a

09:25.667 --> 09:26.268
cellphone?

09:26.302 --> 09:27.605
Wait, no!

09:27.638 --> 09:28.407
Carl: It's awesome.

09:28.440 --> 09:29.342
Master Shake: Carl, I need to

09:29.375 --> 09:30.077
borrow your phone.

09:30.111 --> 09:30.779
This is urgent.

09:30.813 --> 09:31.580
I need to lay a game with it.

09:31.614 --> 09:32.583
Frylock: He's right, Carl.

09:32.617 --> 09:33.251
We got to have it.

09:33.284 --> 09:34.053
Carl: In a second.

09:34.086 --> 09:35.624
I'm not done berating her.

09:35.657 --> 09:37.628
He was one of the Lords of Rock.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.332
A hand job ain't enough.

09:39.365 --> 09:41.169
You got to let him bang you.

09:41.203 --> 09:42.305
See, that's why you're still

09:42.339 --> 09:42.873
single.

09:42.906 --> 09:43.608
Master Shake: Carl!

09:43.642 --> 09:44.410
I need your phone!

09:44.444 --> 09:45.513
Carl: Ah, ah! Hands off!

09:45.547 --> 09:46.715
Master Shake: I can only be

09:46.749 --> 09:47.517
delayed so long.

09:47.551 --> 09:48.319
Carl: Back up!

09:48.353 --> 09:51.160
Why did I call? To do this.

09:51.193 --> 09:52.763
I know I ain't talked to you in

09:52.796 --> 09:53.531
two years.

09:53.565 --> 09:55.402
But if I want to lay into you, I

09:55.435 --> 09:57.173
will, because I'm family and I

09:57.206 --> 09:58.209
have that right.

09:58.242 --> 09:59.445
No, d-don't you hang up on me!

09:59.479 --> 10:00.554
Master Shake: Awesome.

10:00.587 --> 10:01.757
Do you have kangarilla on that

10:01.790 --> 10:02.391
phone?

10:02.426 --> 10:03.394
Carl: Hold your horses,

10:03.428 --> 10:04.062
there.

10:04.095 --> 10:05.098
I'm calling the bitch back.

10:05.132 --> 10:06.167
it's

10:06.200 --> 10:06.802
me-e-e-e!

10:06.836 --> 10:08.139
I'm the gho-o-o-st of the

10:08.172 --> 10:09.775
ghost of the gho-o-o-st that was

10:09.809 --> 10:10.544
just here.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.148
is that a

10:12.181 --> 10:12.715
cellphone?

10:12.749 --> 10:14.386
Wait, no!

10:17.193 --> 10:18.395
Master Shake: Carl, I need to

10:18.428 --> 10:19.297
borrow your phone.

10:19.331 --> 10:21.302
Carl: No!

10:21.335 --> 10:23.173
Pick up that phone or I will

10:23.206 --> 10:24.409
unleash the venom!

10:25.211 --> 10:26.281
denise, this is Carl.

10:26.314 --> 10:27.650
I'm sorry that we had heated

10:27.684 --> 10:28.452
words there.

10:28.486 --> 10:29.688
it's

10:29.721 --> 10:30.390
me-e-e-e.

10:30.423 --> 10:31.425
Carl: H-hang on.

10:31.458 --> 10:32.796
I'm the gho-o-o-st of the

10:32.829 --> 10:34.232
ghost of the ghost of the

10:34.265 --> 10:35.568
gho-o-o-o--

10:35.602 --> 10:37.506
Carl: Uh, call me back if you

10:37.540 --> 10:38.642
get a free moment.

10:38.675 --> 10:40.446
I just, uh, wanted to, uh, to

10:40.479 --> 10:42.283
lord over you for a little bit

10:42.318 --> 10:42.785
longer.

10:42.819 --> 10:43.787
Okay.

10:43.821 --> 10:46.159
Uh...I love you.

10:46.192 --> 10:47.859
it's

10:47.892 --> 10:49.892
me-e-e-e!

10:49.925 --> 10:52.092
it's me-e-e-e!

10:52.125 --> 10:54.159
it's me-e-e-e!

10:54.459 --> 10:55.459
Master Shake: ♪ Dancing is
