WEBVTT

00:01.585 --> 00:04.588
[Singing] It seems today that all you see

00:04.922 --> 00:08.008
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.300 --> 00:11.553
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.845 --> 00:14.348
On which we used to rely?

00:14.932 --> 00:17.309
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.310 --> 00:21.396
Lucky there's a man who
Positively can do

00:21.480 --> 00:23.232
All the things that make us

00:23.315 --> 00:24.775
Laugh and cry

00:24.983 --> 00:29.947
He's a family guy

00:34.159 --> 00:37.454
TV HOST: And now back to
Old People Agree With Arnold Palmer.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.457
Tomato soup, grilled cheese,
and a weak cup of tea...

00:40.541 --> 00:42.167
is the best lunch in my book.

00:43.126 --> 00:45.379
-He's right.
-I enjoy things I remember.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.297
Peter, I'm off to my book club.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.508
Don't forget you have to go
to the PTA meeting.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.969
Me? Go to a PTA meeting?
What, are you high?

00:52.052 --> 00:53.804
Not anymore. I crashed hours ago.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.181
By the way, we're out of chips,
cookies, and Funny Bones.

00:56.265 --> 00:59.226
Now, I'm going to my book club
and you are going to the meeting.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.354
Hey, Brian, how about you go
to that meeting for me, huh?

01:02.437 --> 01:03.981
Yeah. I don't think so.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.691
Oh, come on, buddy. You owe me.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.860
You remember
what I did for you last week?

01:09.236 --> 01:12.531
[Singing] Sighing softly to the river

01:12.614 --> 01:15.534
Comes the loving breeze

01:15.617 --> 01:18.954
Setting nature all aquiver

01:19.037 --> 01:21.331
Rustling through the trees

01:21.415 --> 01:24.251
Through the trees!

01:25.002 --> 01:26.003
[Sighing] All right. I'll go.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.348
Quagmire, what are you doing here?
You don't have kids.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.602
Don't be so sure, Brian.
I've slept with chicks all over the world.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.604
Who knows, I could have kids in their 20s.

01:46.773 --> 01:47.774
[Both talking in Spanish]

02:01.705 --> 02:04.958
-What are you doing here?
-I got roped into this by Peter.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.634
Wow, that's a lovely color.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.678
[Stammering] Your dress is...
The color of your dress is...

02:16.762 --> 02:19.223
-I like... You're very pretty.
-Oh, thank you.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.350
I'm the 11th grade history teacher,
Miss Parks.

02:21.433 --> 02:22.684
Oh! Like Rosa Parks.

02:22.768 --> 02:25.354
Or, you know,
or someone white named Parks.

02:26.355 --> 02:28.482
Nothing cuter than a nervous white dog.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.321
[Stammering] Well, I'm Brian and...

02:34.488 --> 02:37.991
gosh, if I'm not being too forward,
it's lovely to meet you, Miss Parks.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.868
Oh, please. Call me Shauna.

02:39.952 --> 02:43.539
[Singing in barbershop style]
Shauna! Shauna!

02:47.334 --> 02:49.837
So, Brian, you ready
to go play some darts at The Clam?

02:49.920 --> 02:52.506
Sorry, Peter. I can't make it tonight.
I have a date.

02:52.840 --> 02:53.924
Dad!

02:54.007 --> 02:56.760
You were supposed to drive tonight.
What am I supposed to do?

02:56.844 --> 02:59.096
If I drive, I'll have to have
a bunch of drinks first...

02:59.179 --> 03:01.723
because I am very self-conscious
about my driving.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.851
Oh, you've got a date! What's his name?

03:03.934 --> 03:05.978
Do you see that? Do you see what I did?

03:06.061 --> 03:08.438
I made it seem
as though you were a homosexual.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.773
That's funny to me.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.860
How exciting, Brian.
So who's the lucky lady?

03:12.943 --> 03:15.028
Well, actually, her name is Shauna Parks.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.363
Meg's teacher?

03:17.197 --> 03:19.116
Yeah, we really hit it off. She's great.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.909
Brian on a date.

03:20.993 --> 03:24.788
That'll be more pathetic than that game
of Marco Polo I played with Helen Keller.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.039
Marco.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.083
Marco.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.252
Marco.

03:31.253 --> 03:32.504
Marco.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.548
Marco.

03:35.799 --> 03:36.800
Marco.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.094
Marco.

03:39.928 --> 03:40.929
Marco.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.056
Marco.

03:46.852 --> 03:49.438
I don't know. I mean,
I think I want to have kids someday.

03:49.521 --> 03:52.065
Oh, I love kids. I just love them.

03:52.149 --> 03:55.319
I can't get enough of those
little buggers, let me tell you.

03:55.402 --> 03:59.573
You know, it's like I tell the other
volunteers down at the adoption center:

03:59.907 --> 04:03.493
My God, you know, if I could just take
all the orphans in the world...

04:03.577 --> 04:06.413
and just, you know,
buy a farm somewhere...

04:06.496 --> 04:08.498
and let them all run free, you know.

04:08.582 --> 04:12.503
Just let them do little macaroni-art
pictures of their dead parents.

04:12.711 --> 04:15.088
[Stammering] So what's it like to work
at a high school?

04:15.172 --> 04:16.882
Oh, Brian, I just love it.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.467
Working at James Woods High is great.

04:18.550 --> 04:21.929
You know, I've always wondered why they
named if after James Woods, you know?

04:22.012 --> 04:24.014
I mean, there's got to be somebody
more deserving.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.600
Like, just, you know,
off the top of my head, I don't know...

04:26.683 --> 04:30.562
Sidney Poitier, Reggie Jackson,
Martin Luther King...

04:31.605 --> 04:33.774
You know, those are just three names
that come to mind.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.359
Brian, that's a great idea.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.903
We should get them to rename the school
after Dr. King.

04:37.986 --> 04:42.157
You like Dr. King?
Because I love Dr. King. I love... M.L.K!

04:42.407 --> 04:44.368
Man, he's my guy.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.371
He's... I mean, I love all black people,
you know.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.374
I mean, if I could take
all the black people in the world...

04:50.457 --> 04:54.294
and just, you know, just buy a farm
somewhere and let them all...

04:54.837 --> 04:57.548
Whoa, you know what, that actually
didn't really come out right.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.759
Brian, relax. I'm having a great time.
You don't have to try so hard.

05:00.843 --> 05:05.138
Great. Great. 'Cause, you know, I'm not
okay with slavery. Just so we're clear.

05:05.472 --> 05:08.517
[Stammering] I mean, if I was offered
a slave, I'd say no.

05:10.811 --> 05:11.895
By the way, Bonnie...

05:11.979 --> 05:14.565
we just finished reading
The Da Vinci Code at my book club.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.608
You were right. It's terrific.

05:16.692 --> 05:21.238
Let me guess. Some flowery, 300-page,
menopausal masturbatory aid.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.656
I loved it.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.158
And the chapters are only
about two pages long.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.035
So you feel really smart when you read it.

05:27.119 --> 05:28.704
Take it outside, Lois.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.999
Good night, sweetie.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.254
Oh, yes. Just as I thought: France, art...

05:37.421 --> 05:38.547
murder?

05:38.630 --> 05:42.384
Well, this is a bigger surprise than
that time Peter vanished into thin air.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.846
-Hey, Stewie. Peekaboo!
-Yes, I see you, fat man.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.264
Where's Daddy?

05:47.389 --> 05:49.933
Where did you go? Oh, this is impossible.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.102
I can hear you, but I can't see...

05:52.186 --> 05:54.104
Well, he must really be gone!

05:54.897 --> 05:57.816
-Peekaboo!
-How the hell did you do that?

05:57.900 --> 06:00.736
I thought you'd disappeared,
otherwise I wouldn't have picked my...

06:00.819 --> 06:02.738
Great, leave when I'm in the middle
of a sentence.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.951
Hey, there you are, Brian.
We're all set for tonight, right?

06:08.035 --> 06:10.871
Oh, tonight's no good, Peter.
I have another date with Shauna.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.331
Oh, come on. Again?

06:12.414 --> 06:15.292
Well, fine, Brian. If that girl
is more important to you than me...

06:15.375 --> 06:17.628
then I guess
I'll have to find a new best pal.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.924
Boy, Barney, it's sure been great
hanging out with you.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.133
[Barney laughing]

06:23.217 --> 06:24.635
BARNEY: I've enjoyed it, too, Peter.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.304
Hey, you almost done in the john?
'Cause we're late for darts.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.722
All done, Peter.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.267
You think you have a crap job.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.736
I don't need Brian to watch TV with.
I got you, Meg.

06:43.195 --> 06:45.906
Hey, what's that? What's that?
Is that a dog?

06:46.031 --> 06:47.783
Is that another dog on the TV, huh?

06:47.866 --> 06:50.160
You see that? Go get it. Go get it.

06:50.536 --> 06:52.704
What's that? Who's that? Who's that?

06:52.788 --> 06:53.872
Oh! Who's that?

06:53.997 --> 06:55.707
Who's there?
Is there somebody at the door?

06:55.791 --> 06:57.292
Somebody at the door? Huh?

06:57.376 --> 06:59.503
Somebody at the door?
What are you gonna do about it?

06:59.586 --> 07:01.547
What are you gonna do about it?

07:01.630 --> 07:03.090
What are you...

07:03.173 --> 07:05.175
I'm not a dog, you fat bastard!

07:08.804 --> 07:10.806
Wow, Stewie, you're up early.

07:10.889 --> 07:13.183
I'm up still. I've been reading all night.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.352
Hang on, Lois. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

07:15.435 --> 07:19.064
Well, I loved this book.

07:19.189 --> 07:22.109
Nothing like a good story
to recharge your batteries.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.236
[Snoring]

07:24.319 --> 07:26.196
Hey, everybody, check this out.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.491
This is wonderful. Look at this, Peter.

07:29.867 --> 07:32.536
"Two hundred die in train derailment."

07:32.619 --> 07:36.123
Oh, God, Lois.
That is just morbidly obese.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.624
No, no, Peter. Right here.

07:37.708 --> 07:41.003
I mentioned to Shauna that they ought to
change the name of James Woods High...

07:41.086 --> 07:43.714
to Martin Luther King, Jr.,
and she really ran with it.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.382
The school board is voting on it tomorrow.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.176
Congratulations, Brian.

07:47.259 --> 07:48.719
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait, wait, wait.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.930
You and your girlfriend are taking the
name James Woods off the high school?

07:52.014 --> 07:54.558
-Well, yes. For Martin Luther King.
-That's crazy.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.436
You're gonna name the school
after the star of Space 1999?

07:57.519 --> 07:58.979
No, that's Martin Landau.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.481
-Oh. The guy who played Sheneneh?
-That's Martin Lawrence.

08:01.565 --> 08:02.900
-The drunk crooner?
-That's Dean Martin.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.234
The drink that's best served on the rocks?

08:04.318 --> 08:05.402
Martini & Rossi.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.862
-The guy on The West Wing?
-Martin Sheen.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.322
-The guy from Platoon?
-Charlie Sheen.

08:08.405 --> 08:09.740
No, no, the other guy from Platoon.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.658
-[Pondering] It's...
-Come on.

08:11.825 --> 08:12.951
Willem Dafoe.

08:13.035 --> 08:16.288
No, it's Tom Berenger.
We were looking for Tom Berenger.

08:16.371 --> 08:19.082
Well, thanks for playing.
I'm sorry it didn't work out for you.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.752
Oh, that's okay. I had a lot of fun.
I'm a big fan of the show.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.504
Wait a minute!

08:23.587 --> 08:27.508
Peter, Martin Luther King was
an inspiration to an entire generation.

08:27.591 --> 08:30.052
He was a driving force
behind the civil rights movement.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.804
Lois, we're talking about
Rhode Island's own James Woods here.

08:32.888 --> 08:35.224
He's a hero in these parts, huh?
Use your head.

08:35.307 --> 08:36.517
Peter, you're acting like an idiot.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.810
Oh, yeah? I don't like the way
you've been acting lately.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.479
I think it has a lot to do
with that woman...

08:40.562 --> 08:41.980
you've been spending so much time with.

08:42.064 --> 08:44.191
Why don't you just mind
your own damn business, Peter?

08:44.274 --> 08:46.610
Will you guys stop fighting, please?

08:47.319 --> 08:48.570
What's wrong with Meg?

08:48.654 --> 08:51.114
Oh, nothing.
It's just her time of the month.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.866
Not again.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.046
Well, Mr. Griffin, your arguments
for the school's name change...

09:06.129 --> 09:07.381
are quite compelling.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.174
Brian, I think you did it.

09:09.258 --> 09:10.509
Oh, amen.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.845
By the way,
I just want to remind everybody...

09:12.928 --> 09:15.806
to put their e-mail address
on the list in the back there...

09:15.889 --> 09:18.475
so we can send you
our quarterly newsletter.

09:18.600 --> 09:23.230
It's chock-full of goings-on around
the school. It's got a word jumble.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.398
A little hint:

09:24.481 --> 09:27.568
All the answers have to do
with something here at the school.

09:27.651 --> 09:29.778
Yes, I'm sure
we're all looking forward to that.

09:29.862 --> 09:33.490
Now, unless there is any objection,
I move that the board pass this measure.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.493
I've got an objection,
and so does this man.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.204
James Woods!

09:39.288 --> 09:40.747
-Oh, my God.
-I don't believe it.

09:40.831 --> 09:42.583
Hi. How are you? Hello, everyone.

09:42.666 --> 09:45.419
He brought James Woods here?
What the hell is he doing?

09:45.502 --> 09:47.671
Believe me,
Peter does stupid things all the time.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.339
That's why he got fired from that airline.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.843
-Coffee for you, Capt. Griffin?
-Thank you, stewardess.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.721
Hey, where are we right now?

09:56.388 --> 09:57.598
On an airplane?

09:57.681 --> 10:00.893
No. This room. What is this room called?

10:00.976 --> 10:03.770
-The flight deck?
-No.

10:03.854 --> 10:06.940
-Control room?
-No.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.025
Cockpit?

10:11.403 --> 10:13.989
Oh, God! I told you I'd get her to say it.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.117
Oh, God!

10:17.201 --> 10:18.744
All right. Go on. Get out of here.

10:18.911 --> 10:22.164
Look, I came as soon as
Peter contacted my website.

10:22.247 --> 10:26.293
Let me just say, I'm all in favor
of renaming the school after Dr. King.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.628
-What?
-Wow!
