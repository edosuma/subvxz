00:09.592 --> 00:11.928
[Sam] Jo, say something. You--

00:12.011 --> 00:13.596
You're scaring me.

00:16.850 --> 00:17.851
You gotta go home.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.397
You gotta go home, Sam.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.113
[narrator]  William Gordon White,

00:30.196 --> 00:32.365
64, of Newport, Rhode Island,

00:32.449 --> 00:35.201
passed away due to complications
from heart failure.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.874
[screaming]

00:40.957 --> 00:43.460
[narrator]  William is survived
by his wife Tina

00:43.543 --> 00:45.003
and his daughter Samantha.

00:47.088 --> 00:49.507
William enjoyed cooking, gardening

00:49.591 --> 00:51.426
and spending time with his family,

00:51.509 --> 00:53.136
particularly his daughter Sam,

00:53.219 --> 00:56.139
whom he affectionately called "Samwich."

01:00.518 --> 01:03.438
[school bell rings]

01:05.774 --> 01:07.609
[narrator]  A high school English teacher,

01:07.692 --> 01:09.027
William was an avid reader

01:09.110 --> 01:10.278
and proud board member

01:10.361 --> 01:12.113
of the Providence Athenaeum.

01:12.197 --> 01:16.743
He never retired, his passion
for education fulfilling him to the end.

01:16.826 --> 01:18.745
And these are the best years of your life.

01:18.828 --> 01:21.081
Don't waste them
by making things difficult.

01:21.998 --> 01:24.584
Did you really just call me
to tell me I'm difficult?

01:24.667 --> 01:26.419
No, I, uh--I tried to text you and--

01:26.503 --> 01:27.962
All right, Dad.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.756
Take care. Good night.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.217
[narrator]  A celebration-of-life service

01:32.300 --> 01:34.302
will be held at Campbell Funeral Home.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.471
You ready?

01:45.188 --> 01:47.899
Don't you worry about nothing
while you're gone.

01:47.982 --> 01:49.818
We got the bigger venue for Carson.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.612
This Rikki Carter event's
gonna look as relevant

01:52.695 --> 01:54.697
as a statement of apology
from Kevin Spacey.

01:54.781 --> 01:55.782
[laughs]

01:55.865 --> 01:57.408
I appreciate it.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.495
And if you're looking
for something therapeutic,

02:00.578 --> 02:02.205
I could give you a picture of Rikki Carter

02:02.288 --> 02:03.373
and a set of darts.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.667
She already has both.

02:06.793 --> 02:07.919
Thanks, Reg.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.216
Text me when you make it.

02:13.299 --> 02:14.634
-[Sam sighs]
-Promise.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.438
Ah, here you go.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.607
I filled her up,
and I sprung for full coverage,

02:29.691 --> 02:31.609
because Joelle is driving.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.945
For the record, I'm an excellent driver.

02:34.028 --> 02:36.322
I just don't like
when people get in my way.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.324
They're public roads.
People tend to be on them.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.660
Oh, and I got you guys some water.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.662
You know? Just in case.

02:43.204 --> 02:44.330
In case of Armageddon?

02:44.414 --> 02:46.499
It's a two-hour drive.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.334
Okay, thanks, Gabe.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.169
Yeah, of course. Hey, I got it.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.589
-Thank you.
-And you know, if you, uh...

02:54.674 --> 02:58.344
If you need absolutely anything...
you know.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.596
Yeah, I do.

Uh, are we gonna-- okay.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.277
Okay, say your secret bestie goodbyes.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.697
Gabe...

03:17.780 --> 03:19.157
-Yeah?
-You know,

03:19.949 --> 03:22.452
it's nice having a friend
with an AARP discount.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.538
Eh, could you say that into my good ear?

03:25.622 --> 03:27.373
[laughs]

03:27.457 --> 03:28.708
Hey, wait! Wait! Wait!

03:30.168 --> 03:31.377
The hell?

03:31.461 --> 03:32.587
Co, what are you doing?

03:32.670 --> 03:34.297
-I'm going with you.
-You know we're going

03:34.380 --> 03:35.924
to a funeral and not an outlet mall?

03:36.007 --> 03:38.009
Sam, I loved your dad.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.260
He was like a father to me.

03:39.344 --> 03:43.431
Yeah, but he actually was
a father to me, so...

03:43.514 --> 03:46.351
Either I come with you or take the train.

03:46.434 --> 03:50.521
I will be there for you. And low-key,
I've been talking with your mom.

03:50.605 --> 03:51.731
She's expecting me.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.237
Get in, Co.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.405
-[honks horn]
-Motherfucker, you should've walked

03:59.489 --> 04:01.115
if you wanted to drive this slow!

04:01.199 --> 04:02.909
-Ooh, outlet mall!
-Not stopping.

04:02.992 --> 04:04.285
Why do you get to decide?

04:04.369 --> 04:06.454
Sam may benefit
from a soothing walk

04:06.537 --> 04:08.039
through discount leather goods.

04:08.122 --> 04:09.374
Not stopping.

04:09.457 --> 04:10.792
[sighs] We can't stop for Funyuns.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.418
We can't stop for Fendi.

04:12.502 --> 04:13.711
What are we supposed to do on this ride?

04:13.795 --> 04:16.506
Are you looking for suggestions?
'Cause I got a few.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.341
Sam loves music!

04:18.424 --> 04:19.926
I got a great playlist.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.903
I appreciate you trying to entertain me,
but...

04:39.946 --> 04:42.365
I just want to be.

Okay?

04:47.745 --> 04:49.706

I wish Billy were here to back me up.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.515
He hated the way the Democrats moved
to the center.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.100
That's not what he hated.

07:14.183 --> 07:16.227
He hated it when you called him Billy.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.396
That's what  William  hated.

07:18.479 --> 07:19.480
He was my brother.

07:19.564 --> 07:22.275
Ah, yes,
but he thought you were an ass-hat.

How you holding up there?

07:32.076 --> 07:35.538
-Oh, you know, the best I can.
-Yeah, it's hard to believe he's gone.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.498
He's not gone.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.125
Billy is right here with us,

07:39.208 --> 07:41.252
right now, watching over us,

07:42.211 --> 07:43.796
and he's agreeing with me.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.675
Really? Really? So I assume you're gonna
introduce us here.

-Joelle?
-No, I'm Joelle.

-Hi.
-Yeah, it's...

07:53.639 --> 07:54.807
Right, right, right.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.559
Guys, I'm gonna go find my mom.

-I'll see you all later.

Hi, Mrs. White. Hi.

08:10.448 --> 08:11.699
How was your drive?

08:11.782 --> 08:13.618
Well, Jo was behind the wheel,

08:13.701 --> 08:16.662
and the fact that I'm able
to wrap my arms around you is a blessing.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.039
[laughs]

08:18.122 --> 08:19.832
Hey, how you holding up?

08:19.916 --> 08:21.250
You know.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.335
How are you?

08:22.418 --> 08:23.961
I'm good. I'm terrific.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.380
So listen, can I get you girls some food,

08:26.464 --> 08:28.216
or a beverage or dessert or--

08:28.299 --> 08:29.550
Why "or"?

08:29.634 --> 08:31.302
-Right. You know what?
-[laughs]

08:31.385 --> 08:33.971
You girls are so sweet
to travel all this way with Sam,

08:34.096 --> 08:35.723
and you look so gorgeous!

08:35.806 --> 08:37.600
What they putting in the water
at that school?

08:37.683 --> 08:39.810
Mostly lead, but they finally
changed the pipes.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.897
Joelle, you crack me up, girl. [laughs]

08:42.980 --> 08:44.482
Can I help with anything, Miss Tina?

08:44.565 --> 08:46.317
I can make a crudité platter

08:46.400 --> 08:47.902
that looks like an owl.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.905
[Tina laughs] You know what?
You're a damn dream, Coco.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.448
You know, last time she was here,

08:52.532 --> 08:53.908
she turned a watermelon into a swan.

08:53.991 --> 08:56.285
Turning fruits and vegetables
into animals.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.371
-She's practically Jesus.
-Right?

08:58.454 --> 09:00.623
"Congratulations"?
What is that about?

09:00.706 --> 09:02.542
Oh, that's your Aunt Pearl.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.293
Either she's bad at the Internet

09:04.377 --> 09:06.837
or she's an asshole who hated my husband.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.090
Sam, I need you to come
and finish up this lemonade.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.759
I need to go downstairs to the basement,
get some more soda.

09:11.842 --> 09:14.178
Your Uncle Stu will drink
that Coke Zero Sugar

09:14.262 --> 09:16.764
like the meaning of life is
at the bottom of the can.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.770
She seems to be taking things well.

09:22.853 --> 09:25.356
Yeah, it's weird.
Usually, I'm the stoic one.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.607
She's the one who cries

09:26.691 --> 09:28.484
at videos of babies singing Gospel.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.987
Is that a genre? What?

09:31.070 --> 09:32.780
The Internet's been holding out on me!

09:32.863 --> 09:35.157
Oh, my God, I'm so excited.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.326
So it's Billy and Tina's first date.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.997
-After he asked her out, like, 15 times.
-[laughing]

09:41.080 --> 09:43.207
[Mike] They're getting hammered
watching the Celtics,

09:43.291 --> 09:45.626
and imagine, Billy's rooting for Boston,
of course,

09:45.710 --> 09:46.794
'cause, you know,

09:46.877 --> 09:48.170
-he's got a soul.
-Oh, stop.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.880
And Tina's rooting for Orlando,

09:49.964 --> 09:52.133
'cause she has a crush
on a young Shaquille O'Neal.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.343
Must you always tell this story?

09:54.427 --> 09:56.470
We tease her relentlessly

09:56.554 --> 09:58.014
because she fell for William,

09:58.097 --> 10:00.099
who couldn't look less like Shaq.

10:00.182 --> 10:01.559
Well, can a sister have range?

10:01.642 --> 10:03.436
[Mike] Anyways, they make this bet..

10:03.519 --> 10:04.729
Whoever's team loses

10:04.812 --> 10:06.439
has to run naked into Wallum Lake.

10:06.522 --> 10:08.691
Okay, get it, Papa White!

10:08.774 --> 10:10.318
And, of course, Orlando wins,

10:10.401 --> 10:12.486
so Billy, being a man of his word,

10:12.570 --> 10:15.740
drops trou and drives into the lake.

10:15.823 --> 10:18.951
And I don't know if it was the beer
or her being ride-or-die,

10:19.035 --> 10:20.995
but Tina strips down

10:21.078 --> 10:24.415
and jumps in the lake,
and they have their first kiss.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.542
Cold, naked kiss.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.918
-All right.
-[all] Oh!

10:28.002 --> 10:29.420
Why'd you have to take it there?

10:29.962 --> 10:31.922
I present my famous...

10:32.632 --> 10:34.133
hoo-dité.

10:34.216 --> 10:35.593
-[Mike] Oh.
-[Stu] Hmm.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.845
Because owls go "hoo."

10:37.928 --> 10:39.597
We get it, Co, but "hoo" did you think

10:39.680 --> 10:40.723
was gonna laugh at that?

10:40.806 --> 10:42.767
[laughing]

10:46.103 --> 10:48.189
Must be nice having a college campus.

10:48.272 --> 10:49.523
Like, a real one,

10:49.607 --> 10:51.192
with trees and cute boys.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.777
[Sam] Yeah, it's great.

10:52.860 --> 10:56.072
University of Phoenix didn't have either.
I mean, I'm sure they had cute boys,

10:56.155 --> 10:58.866
but I couldn't see them
through my computer.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.369
Sam, can you tell this fool

11:01.452 --> 11:03.079
that no self-respecting music lover

11:03.162 --> 11:05.748
would ever call Elvis "The King"?

11:05.831 --> 11:07.166
Here it is. "Elvis Presley,

11:07.249 --> 11:10.002
AKA 'The King of Rock and Roll.'"

11:10.086 --> 11:11.879
Now, are you calling Wikipedia a liar?

11:11.962 --> 11:13.214
Dad actually called him

11:13.297 --> 11:15.424
"the king of whitewashing
and cultural appropriation."

11:15.508 --> 11:18.010
-Wonder why that never caught on.
-[laughing]

11:18.552 --> 11:20.846
A toast to Papa White!

11:20.930 --> 11:22.181
Aww, man.

11:22.264 --> 11:24.183
May he live on forever

11:24.266 --> 11:25.518
in all of us.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.353
-All right, cheers.
-You're sweet.

11:27.436 --> 11:28.771
Oh, I got you, girl.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.064
Oh, I didn't get you.

11:30.147 --> 11:31.649
-[laughing]
-All right.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.567
[Mike] Oh, that's, uh...

11:33.651 --> 11:35.236
[clears throat]

11:35.820 --> 11:37.863
Does this taste like tea to anybody else?

11:38.572 --> 11:40.116
Sam and I may have broken into

11:40.199 --> 11:41.909
Papa White's stash freshman year.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.036
And it's possible that

11:44.120 --> 11:45.788
we replaced it with tea

11:45.871 --> 11:47.665
to cover our tracks, allegedly.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.083
-Allegedly.
-Wow!

11:49.166 --> 11:50.876
[clamoring]

11:50.960 --> 11:52.795
[laughing]

11:52.878 --> 11:54.880
Uncle Billy probably knew about that,

11:54.964 --> 11:57.091
but he let it slide.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.676
He loved you so much.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.303
He really was at peace.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.346
Even in the hospital,

12:02.430 --> 12:03.597
after his second surgery,

12:03.681 --> 12:05.015
he was still cracking jokes.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.308
Second surgery?

12:06.392 --> 12:07.726
Oh, we were praying so hard

12:07.810 --> 12:09.562
after his first one, but...

12:09.645 --> 12:11.063
he just kept saying,

12:11.147 --> 12:12.857
"When your heart's as big as mine,

12:12.940 --> 12:14.775
it's gonna need some extra work."

12:14.859 --> 12:16.193
[chattering continuing]

12:23.075 --> 12:25.411
Sam, could you get me some more
of those containers, please?

12:33.669 --> 12:34.837
Maybe...

12:36.297 --> 12:38.132
we should consume...

12:38.215 --> 12:39.967
these 12...

12:40.050 --> 12:41.260
bricks...

12:41.343 --> 12:42.928
of chili...

12:43.012 --> 12:44.263
from Labor Day

12:44.346 --> 12:45.973
before we freeze any more.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.643
Can you take a break?
I need to talk to you.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.479
We'll have time to talk.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.063
Now I have a house full of guests

12:53.147 --> 12:54.398
and a speech to write.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.484
How's yours coming along?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.694
I don't feel like speaking, Mom.

12:58.777 --> 13:00.738
Can't I just grieve in peace?

13:00.821 --> 13:02.281
You are his only child.

13:02.364 --> 13:03.491
People are gonna expect to hear from you.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.743
I expected to hear from you

13:05.826 --> 13:08.162
that Dad went back
into the hospital again.

13:11.707 --> 13:14.376
I was holding out hope
that he was gonna recover.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.546
He had such a positive attitude,
and calling you home--

13:17.630 --> 13:18.881
it would have felt like...

13:20.341 --> 13:21.800
like I was giving up.

13:22.676 --> 13:25.054
Well, for me, it would've felt like

13:25.137 --> 13:27.181
getting a chance to say goodbye.

13:27.264 --> 13:28.891
But you took that from me,

13:29.808 --> 13:31.727
and I lost my father.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.562
And I lost my husband.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.524
That man was the only person

13:36.607 --> 13:38.275
who really understood me.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.028
For years after we married,

13:41.111 --> 13:42.238
[quietly] nobody in my family

13:42.321 --> 13:43.656
would even talk to me.

13:44.448 --> 13:45.866
It was just us.

13:48.285 --> 13:49.995
He was my whole world.

13:51.914 --> 13:55.376
So you don't have a monopoly on grief,
little girl.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.681
[laughs] I always knew you were a witch.

14:08.764 --> 14:11.392
My flawless skin does suggest magic.

14:11.475 --> 14:13.227
Happy to mix you a vial.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.729
It's formulated especially for us Kellys.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.402
Girl, if you got bedbugs up in here,
you needed to tell me 200 miles ago.

14:21.485 --> 14:22.778
Why didn't she tell me

14:22.862 --> 14:24.613
my dad was in the hospital again?

14:24.697 --> 14:27.116
She called to tell me
she got a new dishwasher.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.200
Well, it was a Bosch.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.743
They're virtually silent.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.454
[Coco] Everyone has their own way
of dealing with grief.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.666
Life has a way of forcing us
to make tough choices.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.835
Certainly made my share.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.295
Like what?

14:39.378 --> 14:40.379
This isn't about me.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.007
I'm not even mad at her.
I'm mad at myself.

14:44.091 --> 14:45.551
The last time I talked to my dad,

14:45.634 --> 14:47.970
I didn't even let him finish his sentence
before I hung up.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.764
Yeah, but no one expects
to finish a sentence around you.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.393
You just lost your dad.
Don't beat yourself up over a phone call.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.229
He deserved so much better.

14:58.272 --> 14:59.899
In high school, someone on the debate team

14:59.982 --> 15:01.400
thought he was my driver,

15:01.483 --> 15:02.943
and I never set them straight.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.987
They thought a white man was  your  driver?

15:05.070 --> 15:06.655
What kind of town is this?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.324
Now I'm supposed to speak at his funeral.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.493
I don't know what to say.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.287
Just speak from the heart.
You love talking.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.205
It's... kind of your thing.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.415
You'll do great.

15:16.498 --> 15:19.376
But you should prepare something
in case you get choked up.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.587
She doesn't need homework.
You're stressing her out.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.130
I'm helping her,

15:23.213 --> 15:25.215
not just co-signing
everything that she says.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.467
You never challenge her.

15:26.550 --> 15:29.053
This isn't the time to challenge her.
Her father just died.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.555
[Coco] Sure, but to blindly support her--

15:31.639 --> 15:32.848
how's she ever gonna grow?

15:32.932 --> 15:35.643
[Joelle] Maybe she doesn't want to grow.
Maybe she just wants to cry.

15:35.726 --> 15:36.685
That one.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.145
I really do.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.777
Well, you got my shoulder,

15:44.860 --> 15:47.112
and... though it's a touch bonier

15:47.196 --> 15:48.405
and ice-cold,

15:48.489 --> 15:50.616
Coco's shoulder as well.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.334
I don't deserve to speak at his funeral.

16:01.543 --> 16:02.962
I just yelled at my mom.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.756
I treated my dad like crap.

16:05.839 --> 16:07.883
What is wrong with me?

16:07.967 --> 16:11.428
I have a list.
You prefer a PDF or a Word doc?

16:12.304 --> 16:14.223
I just should've been nicer to him.

16:15.724 --> 16:16.892
He used to text me

16:16.976 --> 16:18.811
facts about

16:18.894 --> 16:21.355
weird things like the moon.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.150
"It's waxing tonight, Samwich."

16:25.943 --> 16:29.071
"It's a waning gibbous tonight, Samwich."

16:31.073 --> 16:33.492
I never even Googled
what those words mean.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.080
All that rejection.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.416
[melancholy music]

16:40.499 --> 16:42.668
I must've broken his heart.

16:42.751 --> 16:45.379
He never thought of that as rejection.

16:45.462 --> 16:47.172
He was just worried about you.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.341
[scoffs] How do you know?

16:53.804 --> 16:55.514
We stayed in contact,

16:55.597 --> 16:57.850
even after you went all Mean Girl on me,

16:57.933 --> 17:02.980
ending our friendship and your access
to much-needed hair and fashion tips.

17:03.063 --> 17:04.606
Ill-timed shade.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.192
Your dad once told me,

17:07.276 --> 17:08.944
"Sam's difficult.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.321
She'll fight you at every turn,

17:11.405 --> 17:13.824
but that's just because
everything she does,

17:13.907 --> 17:15.409
she does with passion."

17:16.535 --> 17:17.786
He said

17:17.870 --> 17:19.246
his baby girl

17:19.329 --> 17:20.914
was going to change the world.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.877
I'm sitting here,
spinning my friend wheels,

17:24.960 --> 17:26.879
-and you're sitting on that gem?
-[laughs]

17:26.962 --> 17:28.630
-[Sam sniffles]
-[Joelle sighs]

17:29.548 --> 17:31.884
[Sam exhales, sniffles]

17:54.323 --> 17:56.033
[sniffs]

18:17.096 --> 18:19.389
[William] I loved how you
always signed your full name--

18:19.473 --> 18:21.433
Samantha White--

18:22.601 --> 18:25.145
like I wouldn't know
which Samantha it was from.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.563
[chuckles]

18:40.452 --> 18:42.121
What can I say?

18:42.663 --> 18:45.249
I had a fascination with game-changers.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.960
[laughs]

18:58.470 --> 19:01.098
-I can't believe you kept all of these.
-[William] Yep.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.349
I listened to every one

19:02.432 --> 19:03.684
of your broadcasts.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.815
And I also kept every one

19:09.898 --> 19:11.775
of your macaroni projects.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.610
You're the reason I'm a devoted patron

19:13.694 --> 19:15.195
of pasta-based art.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.712
[William]
I found those in a bookstore in town,

19:32.337 --> 19:34.506
right after we dropped you off
freshman year.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.220
Pretty cool, huh?

19:40.304 --> 19:41.930
When the truth is suppressed,

19:42.890 --> 19:43.932
it doesn't die.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.642
It just goes underground.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.606
Ah.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.609
Our favorite book.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.279
Nothing like a little
father-daughter bonding

19:57.362 --> 19:59.072
over organized crime.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.667
[William]  Dear Samwich,

20:11.919 --> 20:13.587
if you've found this,

20:13.670 --> 20:15.505
you're about to read the second-best

20:15.589 --> 20:17.549
piece of writing in this book.

20:17.633 --> 20:18.759
I've always had great respect

20:18.842 --> 20:20.385
for unforeseen circumstances

20:20.469 --> 20:21.678
that can blindside us,

20:21.762 --> 20:24.473
also known as "shit happens,"

20:24.556 --> 20:25.974
and in my case,

20:26.475 --> 20:27.809
shit happened.

20:28.602 --> 20:31.730
So, now that I'm gone,
here's what I need to say.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.067
First off, I know you
must be upset with your mom

20:35.150 --> 20:37.277
for not telling you I was
in the hospital...

20:37.903 --> 20:39.988
but I didn't want you
to see me like that...

20:40.906 --> 20:42.324
so don't blame her.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.660
Also,

20:45.369 --> 20:46.995
I forgive you

20:47.079 --> 20:48.413
for dipping into my special bottle

20:48.497 --> 20:49.498
of Blue Label.

20:49.581 --> 20:50.832
[laughs]

20:50.916 --> 20:53.043
Yeah, I know about that.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.005
You might be angry with me
for not being around.

20:58.131 --> 20:59.174
"That's okay.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.051
Be angry.

21:02.177 --> 21:03.929
That's part of facing grief.

21:05.555 --> 21:08.934
Do or say anything that will help you,

21:09.017 --> 21:12.062
even if it means cursing me up and down.

21:14.064 --> 21:15.565
I'm only a memory now...

21:16.942 --> 21:19.111
and you can't hurt a memory's feelings.

21:19.194 --> 21:22.239
I know the world
is a baffling place, Sam,

21:22.322 --> 21:24.157
and people are the weirdest creatures

21:24.241 --> 21:26.326
in nature, so... [sniffles]

21:26.410 --> 21:29.329
If it all seems very confusing to you,

21:29.830 --> 21:32.124
you're probably just seeing it clearly.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.710
You don't have to be the person

21:34.793 --> 21:36.336
you think I want you to be.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.506
Become the person you want to be.

21:41.049 --> 21:43.677
Walk your path
with awareness and gratitude,

21:45.345 --> 21:47.014
even when it seems imposs--
[voice breaks]

21:50.642 --> 21:52.144
And, Tina...

21:54.187 --> 21:56.898
I know this seems crazy
in light of what's happened,

21:56.982 --> 22:00.444
but you should do

22:00.527 --> 22:03.405
whatever it takes
to be happy in this life.

22:05.198 --> 22:06.533
You deserve to be happy.

22:07.826 --> 22:11.538
My hope is for you
to go on and find love again,

22:11.621 --> 22:15.000
but please, not with Shaquille O'Neal."

22:15.083 --> 22:16.710
[attendees laugh]

22:16.793 --> 22:19.087
[Sam]
"You have your whole life ahead of you.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.922
Make the most of it.

22:24.468 --> 22:25.427
I did."

22:30.140 --> 22:31.725
That was my dad.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.229
He knew I would struggle
with a speech,

22:36.313 --> 22:37.898
so he wrote one for me.

22:42.319 --> 22:44.863
There wasn't anything he wouldn't do
for me.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.077
He was always there.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.707
Challenging me, intellectually.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.378
Keeping me on the right path.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.924
But most importantly,

23:04.007 --> 23:06.968
he wanted to make sure
that I didn't fall prey

23:07.052 --> 23:10.806
to certain social definitions
of who I should be.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.186
Well, Daddy,

23:17.270 --> 23:18.897
you succeeded.

23:21.650 --> 23:22.859
Because of you,

23:22.943 --> 23:25.320
I know who I am,

23:25.404 --> 23:28.156
and I'm going to make you so proud.

23:38.166 --> 23:41.002
Coco, can you grab Sam for me, please?

23:42.337 --> 23:44.214
I'm here, Mom.

23:44.881 --> 23:46.383
[Sam] I just went to Costco.

23:46.466 --> 23:47.592
[Tina] Oh.

23:47.676 --> 23:50.387
Well, I hope you got some
of that rotisserie chicken.

23:50.470 --> 23:51.388
[chuckles]

23:51.471 --> 23:53.014
It always blows my mind how you can have

23:53.098 --> 23:55.642
the world's tastiest chicken
and patio furniture

23:55.725 --> 23:57.352
all in one place.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.273
Actually, I just got plastic containers.

24:03.150 --> 24:05.777
I didn't want all of that amazing chili
of yours

24:05.861 --> 24:07.320
going to waste.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.582
I'm sorry about what I said earlier.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.167
I'm the one who's sorry.

24:22.335 --> 24:23.837
It wasn't until you read that letter

24:23.920 --> 24:25.338
that I realized...

24:26.590 --> 24:28.300
what a brave face he was putting on

24:28.383 --> 24:29.509
for all of us.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.847
I should've known better.

24:40.103 --> 24:41.646
That was Dad.

24:41.730 --> 24:42.647
[laughs]

24:42.731 --> 24:44.399
Always the protector.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.738
You know, I always thought
that our biggest problem

24:49.821 --> 24:51.489
was gonna be getting sick of each other

24:51.573 --> 24:54.618
by the time we... grew old, but...

24:55.368 --> 24:57.537
I never had a chance to get sick of him.

24:58.788 --> 24:59.915
Mom...

25:00.498 --> 25:03.168
[cries]

25:06.880 --> 25:09.549
I promise you'll have a chance
to get sick of me.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.259
[laughing]

25:12.719 --> 25:14.888
Now, I always knew
you were smarter than me,

25:14.971 --> 25:16.723
but I never knew you were stronger.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.643
Samwich. [laughs]

25:22.479 --> 25:24.564
Uh, I've never heard you call me that.

25:26.107 --> 25:28.443
I want to think that
your dad left it for me.

25:31.154 --> 25:33.907
He always gave me the most perfect gifts.

25:46.002 --> 25:48.380
[laughs] Mom...

25:48.463 --> 25:49.839
Look.

25:50.715 --> 25:51.716
It's snowing.

25:54.469 --> 25:56.221
[both laugh]

26:02.310 --> 26:04.312
After we're done with this,

26:04.396 --> 26:06.982
we're gonna exfoliate
those sandpaper elbows.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.942
Do your magic.

26:13.655 --> 26:16.408
Like my world hadn't
turned upside-down enough.

26:16.491 --> 26:17.450
This is happening?

26:17.534 --> 26:18.910
[sighs]

26:18.994 --> 26:20.370
Stockholm syndrome.

26:20.453 --> 26:22.497
I've fallen in love
with my CoverGirl captor.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.790
[cell phone vibrates]

26:26.209 --> 26:27.585
-Hey, Lionel.
-Hey.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.045
What's wrong?

26:29.129 --> 26:30.630
Before you hear about it online,

26:30.714 --> 26:32.382
we lost Carson Rhodes.

26:32.465 --> 26:34.467
What? He died, too?

26:34.551 --> 26:37.012
No. He's not coming to Winchester.

26:37.637 --> 26:38.930
What happened?

26:39.556 --> 26:41.433
[Troy]  In the midst of my downward spiral,

26:41.516 --> 26:43.476
I failed to secure CORE's annual funding.

26:43.893 --> 26:45.270
Mea culpa.

26:45.353 --> 26:48.189
But thanks to you,
I'm having lunch with my dad tomorrow.

26:49.399 --> 26:50.900
Yeah, I'm gonna tell him I love him.

26:50.984 --> 26:52.902
Wait, let's just see how lunch goes.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.362
So I lost my dad, and now,

26:54.446 --> 26:56.364
thanks to you, we lost Carson.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.158
It's not like Coco caught the mistake.

26:58.241 --> 27:00.285
Don't even fucking start with me.

27:00.368 --> 27:01.536
I'm on it.

27:01.995 --> 27:03.538
Is this supposed to burn?

27:03.622 --> 27:04.914
So we got nothing.

27:05.832 --> 27:06.833
Fuck!

27:07.292 --> 27:08.918
Yeah, fuck.

27:13.798 --> 27:14.924
Wait.

27:15.508 --> 27:16.885
Maybe not fuck.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.138
What do you got?

27:22.098 --> 27:23.725
I'll explain when I get back.
