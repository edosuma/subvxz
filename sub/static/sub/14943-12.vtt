Hey! Get off of him!

01:02.133 --> 01:03.563
(Grunting continues)

01:03.564 --> 01:06.096
Get back in your seat. Now!

01:06.097 --> 01:07.838
Pull over.

01:10.141 --> 01:13.273
(Tires squealing)

01:13.274 --> 01:14.344
(Loud thud)

01:14.345 --> 01:17.248
(Squealing continues)

01:29.520 --> 01:31.361
(Pants)

01:31.362 --> 01:32.562
We gotta move, man.

01:32.563 --> 01:34.494
(Man) Just throw me
the key. Be quiet, man.

01:34.495 --> 01:35.695
Come on! What about the driver?

01:35.696 --> 01:38.097
He's out, Riley.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.301
(Man) Come on, man! Come
on, you guys. Just us, guys.

01:42.133 --> 01:43.174
(Metal clangs)

01:45.876 --> 01:47.238

(Groans)

01:59.720 --> 02:01.391
(Gunshots)

02:01.392 --> 02:04.224
This is C.O. Davis. I
have an officer down.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.696
Requesting immediate
medical assistance and backup.

02:06.697 --> 02:08.127
There's an escaped
fugitive on the loose...

02:08.128 --> 02:08.899
Armed and dangerous.

02:08.900 --> 02:12.162
I repeat, armed and dangerous.

02:12.163 --> 02:14.904
(Sirens wailing)

02:14.905 --> 02:16.236
(Police radio chatter)

02:16.237 --> 02:18.238
Robert Riley is a
convicted murderer.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.739
We need to bring him back in.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.212
We can start by tracking
down all his ties on the outside.

02:22.213 --> 02:24.214
Now the marshals, they
got border patrol and airports.

02:24.215 --> 02:25.715
We got trains and buses.

02:25.716 --> 02:27.677
But I want somebody to
contact the transit authority.

02:27.678 --> 02:29.249
Let 'em know we
want Riley's picture

02:29.250 --> 02:31.681
plastered on every
station in the city.

02:31.682 --> 02:33.223
Hi, Dr. Hunt.

02:33.224 --> 02:34.224
Did you see that?

02:34.225 --> 02:35.555
She completely dissed me.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.227
You just gotta get to know her.

02:37.228 --> 02:39.189
Well, that's pretty difficult
when she hardly speaks to me.

02:39.190 --> 02:40.630
Hey.

02:40.631 --> 02:42.562
What are you doing here?

02:42.563 --> 02:44.494
Kate sent me. (Exhales)

02:44.495 --> 02:47.397
Apparently your latest
medicolegal investigator quit...

02:47.398 --> 02:48.568
Again.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.169
I was really
starting to like him.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.273
Really? Because he told me
that you assessed his abilities

02:53.274 --> 02:57.207
as being slightly below
that of a trained monkey.

02:57.208 --> 02:59.509
So I heard you worked
Riley's original murder case.

02:59.510 --> 03:01.811
Yep. Put him away once.

03:01.812 --> 03:02.912
Happy to do it again.

03:02.913 --> 03:05.285
That's Oscar
Ramirez, his cell mate.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.817
Possible accomplice
on the escape.

03:07.818 --> 03:10.460
(Radio chatter continues)

03:10.461 --> 03:11.721
This guy's alive.

03:11.722 --> 03:13.923
Medic! 5 milliliters
epinephrine.

03:13.924 --> 03:16.966
Get me a c.P.R. Mask. Now!

03:16.967 --> 03:18.368
How could the medics miss this?

03:18.369 --> 03:20.330
Blood loss made his
pulse almost nonexistent.

03:20.331 --> 03:22.373
He still has electrical
activity in his body.

03:31.282 --> 03:34.213
(Blows air)

03:34.214 --> 03:35.214
(Gasps)

03:35.215 --> 03:36.386
(Sighs)

03:36.387 --> 03:37.517
(Gasps)

03:37.518 --> 03:38.918
Get an I.V. With fluids in him.

03:38.919 --> 03:41.621
Get him to northeast
general, now!

03:41.622 --> 03:43.853
(Siren wailing) Whoa. Whoa.
Hold on a sec, guys. Hold on.

03:43.854 --> 03:45.925
(Oscar) What...

03:45.926 --> 03:47.527
What happened?

03:47.528 --> 03:48.858
Listen, Mr. Ramirez,
you're headed back to prison

03:48.859 --> 03:50.900
with a few additional charges.

03:50.901 --> 03:52.231
But if you want
to help yourself,

03:52.232 --> 03:53.503
maybe you can tell me
where Riley's headed?

03:53.504 --> 03:54.664
Out of state? Out of country?

03:54.665 --> 03:56.736
Riley's not goin' nowhere.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.408
What are you talking about?

03:58.409 --> 04:01.240
He's got some scores to settle.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.744
(Laughs)

04:25.966 --> 04:30.301
♪♪♪

04:36.877 --> 04:38.808
Meet Emmett and
Caroline harrington.

04:38.809 --> 04:40.009
(Megan) The
harringtons are one of

04:40.010 --> 04:41.511
the wealthiest
families in the city...

04:41.512 --> 04:44.654
Philly main line, old
money, banking industry.

04:44.655 --> 04:46.856
But all Emmett's money
couldn't buy Caroline's happiness.

04:46.857 --> 04:50.289
She had an affair with a man
from a much lower tax bracket.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.861
(Megan) Our
fugitive Robert Riley.

04:51.862 --> 04:53.863
He was working on their
house as a contractor

04:53.864 --> 04:56.326
when he and Caroline started up.

04:56.327 --> 04:58.067
Right under her husband's
nose for about two months.

04:58.068 --> 04:59.769
Then according to a witness,

04:59.770 --> 05:01.431
she tried to break off
the relationship with Riley.

05:01.432 --> 05:03.333
And as a response, he did that.

05:03.334 --> 05:06.706
(Megan) Stabbed her
with his wallboard saw.

05:06.707 --> 05:07.877
Two staff members
testified at the trial.

05:07.878 --> 05:09.038
One of them to motive,

05:09.039 --> 05:10.410
and the other one
actually saw the crime.

05:10.411 --> 05:11.611
(Megan) At the autopsy,

05:11.612 --> 05:13.583
I found Riley's
fingerprints on her body

05:13.584 --> 05:15.445
and his d.N.A.
Under Caroline's nails.

05:15.446 --> 05:17.347
She tried to fight him off.

05:17.348 --> 05:19.048
Now Riley's looking for payback.

05:19.049 --> 05:21.851
We're contacting
all the likely targets,

05:21.852 --> 05:23.353
putting them under
police protection...

05:23.354 --> 05:25.355
Emmett harrington, the d.A.,

05:25.356 --> 05:27.096
the two witnesses who
testified against him,

05:27.097 --> 05:28.698
and you.

05:28.699 --> 05:30.430
Consider me contacted.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.031
You will have a police
escort to and from work

05:32.032 --> 05:34.033
until Riley is caught.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.905
As long as it doesn't
get in the way of my job.

05:35.906 --> 05:37.006
(Cell phone rings)

05:37.007 --> 05:39.038
(Beeps) Megan, listen to him.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.610
Sullivan.

05:40.611 --> 05:42.712
On my way. (Beep)

05:42.713 --> 05:43.873
What?

05:43.874 --> 05:45.576
Riley's already started.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.450
(Door opens)

05:51.782 --> 05:54.083
(Sirens whoop and wail)

05:54.084 --> 05:56.025
(Car doors close)

05:56.026 --> 05:59.989
(Police radio chatter)

05:59.990 --> 06:01.991
So the victim's name
was Marcus webb.

06:01.992 --> 06:03.493
He was the driver...

06:03.494 --> 06:04.894
Harrington's chauffeur.

06:04.895 --> 06:06.866
He testified at the trial

06:06.867 --> 06:09.639
that Riley threatened
to kill Caroline.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.070
Why does it always feel like
we're working her crime scene?

06:11.071 --> 06:13.803
It's not mine. It's his.

06:13.804 --> 06:15.845
(Tommy) Who found the body?

06:15.846 --> 06:17.006
(Adam) They couldn't
reach him by phone,

06:17.007 --> 06:18.608
so uniforms were dispatched.

06:18.609 --> 06:20.880
They saw a window broken.
There was blood on the glass.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.011
So they're running
it against Riley now.

06:22.012 --> 06:24.654
Appears to be a single g.S.W.

06:24.655 --> 06:26.986
To the upper right chest.
(Camera shutter clicking)

06:26.987 --> 06:28.458
No exit.

06:28.459 --> 06:30.159
Signs of struggle,
defensive wounds.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.862
So where are we on
protecting the other targets?

06:32.863 --> 06:34.123
Well, we're still looking for,

06:34.124 --> 06:36.696
uh, the main witness
against Riley... Brad Carter.

06:36.697 --> 06:37.867
He, um... (Clicking continues)

06:37.868 --> 06:39.028
He moved. No change of address.

06:39.029 --> 06:40.169
Otherwise, the d.A.,

06:40.170 --> 06:42.031
Emmett harrington
are under protection,

06:42.032 --> 06:44.504
and we've got,
uh, another officer

06:44.505 --> 06:46.436
looking after your
old flame here.

06:46.437 --> 06:48.007
Old flame?

06:48.008 --> 06:49.839
(Radio chatter continues)

06:49.840 --> 06:52.712
Wait. You and, uh...

06:52.713 --> 06:54.884
You didn't say anything.

06:54.885 --> 06:56.986
Because it's ancient history
and it's nobody's business,

06:56.987 --> 06:58.618
especially junior's.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.620
Junior's? (Chuckles)

07:00.621 --> 07:02.522
(Tommy) I'm sorry. (Sighs)

07:02.523 --> 07:03.853
It just came up.

07:03.854 --> 07:05.054
I didn't think that junior

07:05.055 --> 07:06.896
would be stupid
enough to mention it.

07:06.897 --> 07:09.198
Of course.

07:09.199 --> 07:12.462
Dr. Hunt, I don't
know what to say.

07:12.463 --> 07:14.564
Good, because we're not
talking about it. Do your job.

07:14.565 --> 07:16.165
Which reminds me,

07:16.166 --> 07:18.468
it's not that I don't
mind doing the job

07:18.469 --> 07:21.040
your medicolegal
investigator should be doing...

07:21.041 --> 07:22.512
Which means you do mind.

07:22.513 --> 07:24.644
No, just wondering when
you're gonna hire somebody

07:24.645 --> 07:26.876
that you don't
fire or make quit.

07:26.877 --> 07:30.219
When I find somebody who's
slightly above trained monkey.

07:30.220 --> 07:32.722
And right now, you're the
only one who fits the bill.

07:32.723 --> 07:35.755
I think that was a compliment.

07:35.756 --> 07:36.957
Hey, what is it?

07:39.930 --> 07:41.861
Get a swab of that.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.463
Tell the lab to
rush the results.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.036
(Indistinct conversations)

07:47.037 --> 07:49.639
Please inform my escort that I
want to go back to the m.E.O.

07:49.640 --> 07:52.001
And don't keep me waiting.

07:52.002 --> 07:53.843
(Woman) Dr. Murphy,

07:53.844 --> 07:55.075
the d.A. Is here to see you.

07:56.907 --> 07:58.608
Give us a minute, would you?

07:58.609 --> 08:00.009
Yes, sir.

08:00.010 --> 08:02.011
Dan, I can assure
you that my department

08:02.012 --> 08:04.053
is doing everything we can
to get Riley back behind bars.

08:04.054 --> 08:05.515
Try again.

08:05.516 --> 08:06.916
Excuse me?

08:06.917 --> 08:08.087
You'll have to do
better than that

08:08.088 --> 08:09.619
when you talk to
Emmett harrington.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.090
Personally, I'd go with empathy.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.022
That's why you're here, to tell
me I'm meeting with harrington?

08:13.023 --> 08:15.024
He wants assurances
that we will recapture

08:15.025 --> 08:17.667
the man who killed his wife.

08:17.668 --> 08:18.998
Assurances from me?

08:18.999 --> 08:20.830
A successful
congressional campaign

08:20.831 --> 08:22.131
can cost millions of dollars.

08:22.132 --> 08:23.873
I want you on
harrington's radar.

08:23.874 --> 08:27.136
I'm not sure how I feel
about that. Meaning?

08:27.137 --> 08:29.038
Meaning it doesn't matter how
much money harrington has,

08:29.039 --> 08:30.780
helping to catch
Riley is my job.

08:30.781 --> 08:34.814
And all your doing is making
sure Emmett knows that.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.986
2:00, his house.

08:36.987 --> 08:38.548
Dan...

08:38.549 --> 08:40.650
Why do you want
to run for office?

08:40.651 --> 08:43.522
To be in a position to do
more good than I can now.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.724
Exactly.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.095
For the right reasons.

08:46.096 --> 08:48.157
And this is how it's done.

08:48.158 --> 08:52.001
(People speaking indistinctly)

08:52.002 --> 08:55.935
That guy is supposed to
be protecting me from Riley?

08:55.936 --> 08:58.307
I feel safer being
guarded by you.

08:58.308 --> 09:00.239
Thank you.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.211
That one...

09:02.212 --> 09:05.745
Not a compliment.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.878
Hmm.

09:23.734 --> 09:25.635
(Inhales deeply)

09:25.636 --> 09:27.698
(Exhales)

09:28.969 --> 09:31.941
One projectile.

09:31.942 --> 09:33.843
Appears to be a .45...

09:33.844 --> 09:36.906
Same caliber as the gun
that Riley took off the guard.

09:36.907 --> 09:39.709
I read up on his
case. (Bullet clatters)

09:39.710 --> 09:42.982
You know, Robert Riley's
record was spotless his entire life

09:42.983 --> 09:44.313
till Caroline broke his heart.

09:44.314 --> 09:47.216
Love can bring out
the worst in people.

09:47.217 --> 09:48.918
(Door opens)

09:48.919 --> 09:51.060
Why did the crime lab call
me to pick up your trace report?

09:51.061 --> 09:53.362
Because I was busy.

09:53.363 --> 09:54.724
And I wasn't?

09:54.725 --> 09:56.195
Apparently not. (Scoffs)

09:56.196 --> 09:58.327
Thank you.

09:58.328 --> 09:59.670
Mm-hmm.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.934
Hmm. That was
antibacterial cream.

10:04.935 --> 10:06.906
On the wounds of
a gunshot victim.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.638
That's crazy.

10:08.639 --> 10:10.139
It doesn't make sense.

10:10.140 --> 10:13.082
Why would Riley kill him
and then dress his wounds?

10:13.083 --> 10:14.243
(Keypad beeps, phone rings)

10:14.244 --> 10:15.885
(Line clicks)

10:15.886 --> 10:17.787
(Tommy) Detective
Sullivan. Leave a message.

10:17.788 --> 10:18.988
(Voice mail beeps)

10:18.989 --> 10:21.390
Tommy.

10:21.391 --> 10:23.292
Why aren't you picking up?

10:23.293 --> 10:28.127
I need to talk to you
about the Riley case, now.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.129
(Tires squeal)

10:30.130 --> 10:32.132
(Alarm chirps)

10:43.674 --> 10:45.015
Don't move. (Clicks)

10:53.323 --> 10:54.684
I don't want to
hurt you, Dr. Hunt.

10:54.685 --> 10:56.055
Then how about
putting down that gun?

10:56.056 --> 10:57.857
Just... (Sighs)

10:57.858 --> 10:59.759
Hear me out.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.431
(Sighs) Please.

11:02.432 --> 11:04.363
I need your help.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.165
With what?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.197
Proving that I
didn't kill Caroline.

11:08.198 --> 11:10.199
Why me? I testified against you.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.071
But you were the only
one that was honest

11:12.072 --> 11:13.272
about the evidence
as you saw it.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.104
Everyone else in that
courtroom had an agenda.

11:15.105 --> 11:17.276
Which was what?

11:17.277 --> 11:20.679
Framing me for
Caroline's murder.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.981
Emmett harrington found out

11:21.982 --> 11:23.452
that his wife and I
were having an affair,

11:23.453 --> 11:26.115
and he killed her
and he framed me.

11:26.116 --> 11:28.117
And both witnesses lied.

11:28.118 --> 11:30.259
Why didn't you
bring this up at trial?

11:30.260 --> 11:31.891
No one would
believe a guy like me

11:31.892 --> 11:33.192
over a man like harrington.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.024
But today, I finally
got Marcus webb

11:35.025 --> 11:36.295
to tell me the truth.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.267
Yeah, what's that?

11:38.268 --> 11:40.229
That Emmett harrington paid him

11:40.230 --> 11:43.002
to make up that story about
Caroline breaking up with me.

11:43.003 --> 11:47.106
This would all be a
lot easier to believe...

11:47.107 --> 11:49.138
If you hadn't just
killed Marcus webb.

11:49.139 --> 11:50.780
Hey.

11:50.781 --> 11:53.743
(Pants)

11:53.744 --> 11:58.217
Wait. What... (Pants)

11:58.218 --> 12:00.219
Mar-Marcus webb is dead?

12:00.220 --> 12:01.751
The police are
under the impression

12:01.752 --> 12:03.492
that you broke in and shot him.

12:03.493 --> 12:06.155
No, i... look, I did...
I didn't shoot him.

12:06.156 --> 12:07.827
So it's not your blood
we found on the window?

12:07.828 --> 12:09.899
I broke in,

12:09.900 --> 12:11.460
and, yes, it got physical,

12:11.461 --> 12:13.202
but that was the only
way I could get Marcus

12:13.203 --> 12:15.034
to admit that he
lied on the stand.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.036
But I-I swear to god,
I didn't shoot him.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.107
And I didn't kill him.

12:18.108 --> 12:20.369
And I didn't kill Caroline.

12:20.370 --> 12:23.973
(Sighs) I loved her.

12:23.974 --> 12:26.816
And I would do
nothing to hurt her.

12:26.817 --> 12:29.148
But harrington took her away.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.150
He took everything away from me,

12:31.151 --> 12:35.154
including the last
four years of my life.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.256
You gotta believe me, Dr. Hunt.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.457
(Exhales deeply)

12:38.458 --> 12:39.829
(Police radio chatter)

12:39.830 --> 12:40.930
Please.

12:40.931 --> 12:42.992
(Sighs)

12:42.993 --> 12:44.163
(Radio chatter continues)

12:44.164 --> 12:46.366
(Door opens)

12:49.169 --> 12:50.900
(Siren wailing)

12:50.901 --> 12:52.201
(Tommy) You know,
for a smart woman,

12:52.202 --> 12:54.203
you can be pretty
damn stupid sometimes.

12:54.204 --> 12:55.404
You left alone.

12:55.405 --> 12:57.546
You walked right
into Riley's hands.

12:57.547 --> 12:59.778
He says he didn't kill her. He was
set up. (Camera shutter clicking)

12:59.779 --> 13:01.981
By who, the one-armed man?

13:01.982 --> 13:03.112
Tell me you're not buying this.

13:03.113 --> 13:05.054
I'm not buying anything.

13:05.055 --> 13:06.255
I'm asking questions.

13:06.256 --> 13:10.119
I found antibacterial
cream on webb's wounds.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.290
Great. Set the man free.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.422
Just hear me out, okay?

13:13.423 --> 13:15.965
Riley admits that
he assaulted webb,

13:15.966 --> 13:17.296
but he didn't kill him,

13:17.297 --> 13:20.069
which makes for a
more sensible timeline.

13:20.070 --> 13:23.272
What if Riley fights
with him, leaves,

13:23.273 --> 13:24.834
webb tends to his wounds,

13:24.835 --> 13:27.236
the real killer of Caroline
shows up, shoots him?

13:27.237 --> 13:28.377
Or maybe Riley had
a change of heart,

13:28.378 --> 13:30.239
came back, and
shot webb himself.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.241
If he's so innocent, what's he
doing there in the first place?

13:32.242 --> 13:34.813
According to him, both
witnesses lied on the stand,

13:34.814 --> 13:36.085
and he got webb to admit

13:36.086 --> 13:39.188
that Emmett harrington
paid him for his testimony.

13:39.189 --> 13:41.290
Yeah, but you yourself said
Riley's d.N.A. And fingerprints

13:41.291 --> 13:42.892
were on Caroline's body.

13:42.893 --> 13:44.593
Yeah, those might have come
from the romantic relationship

13:44.594 --> 13:46.255
and not from the struggle.

13:46.256 --> 13:48.227
He might not be
the killer we think.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.398
Or he could be just using you.

13:49.399 --> 13:51.060
But we can't back up
any of his accusations

13:51.061 --> 13:53.002
because webb is dead.
I know. It's a problem,

13:53.003 --> 13:54.403
which is why I
want you to look into

13:54.404 --> 13:57.066
any large payments that both
witnesses might have received.

13:57.067 --> 13:59.168
Yeah. Listen, I'm a
little busy right now

13:59.169 --> 14:01.370
protecting people
from a violent fugitive.

14:01.371 --> 14:03.342
But I know what
this is all about.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.614
You worked the original case.

14:05.615 --> 14:07.176
Kind of afraid you messed up.

14:07.177 --> 14:08.417
(Camera shutter clicks)

14:08.418 --> 14:09.979
(Police radio chatter)

14:09.980 --> 14:11.280
Witnesses lie.

14:11.281 --> 14:13.983
Evidence doesn't.

14:13.984 --> 14:15.154
(Camera shutter clicks)

14:15.155 --> 14:17.526
I need to look at
Caroline's body again.

14:17.527 --> 14:19.228
(Radio chatter continues)

14:19.229 --> 14:21.090
(Camera shutter clicks)

14:21.091 --> 14:23.533
(Man) When Caroline was
killed, it was a very difficult time.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.137
Now with Riley out there...

14:28.138 --> 14:30.539
I can only imagine
what you must be feeling.

14:30.540 --> 14:32.141
We saw the news.

14:32.142 --> 14:34.273
Marcus webb was shot?

14:34.274 --> 14:36.475
I'm afraid so, yes.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.308
Oh, he was one of my
chauffeurs for almost ten years.

14:39.309 --> 14:42.081
A good man, dead...

14:42.082 --> 14:44.183
(Huffs) All because of Riley.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.654
They need to find him

14:45.655 --> 14:47.316
before he hurts somebody else.

14:47.317 --> 14:50.019
Stacey, I'm sure
Dr. Murphy is well aware

14:50.020 --> 14:51.520
of the urgency.

14:51.521 --> 14:53.062
I can assure both of you

14:53.063 --> 14:54.323
that my department
will be working nonstop

14:54.324 --> 14:56.225
along with every law
enforcement agency in the city

14:56.226 --> 14:58.367
to make sure that
Riley's recaptured.

14:58.368 --> 15:02.031
And once he is, he will never
see the light of day again.

15:02.032 --> 15:04.103
(Woman) Ma'am? Ma'am, excuse
me. (Megan) Thank you. I'm fine.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.204
I can find my own way.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.136
(Door closes) Megan.

15:07.137 --> 15:09.278
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Harrington,
this is Dr. Megan hunt.

15:09.279 --> 15:11.680
Hello. She's the primary
pathologist on the Marcus webb case.

15:11.681 --> 15:14.183
Yes, and I don't
know if you recall,

15:14.184 --> 15:17.046
but I was the medical
examiner at Robert Riley's trial.

15:17.047 --> 15:18.247
Yes, Dr. Hunt. My pleasure.

15:18.248 --> 15:20.919
I'm sorry for the
intrusion, but...

15:20.920 --> 15:23.122
Because of Riley's escape,

15:23.123 --> 15:24.423
the identity of
Caroline's killer

15:24.424 --> 15:26.225
has been called into question.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.157
You're saying Robert
Riley might be innocent?

15:28.158 --> 15:30.399
That's not what she's saying.
That's exactly what I'm saying.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.362
I would like to reopen
Caroline's case,

15:33.363 --> 15:35.264
and to do that, I would
need your permission

15:35.265 --> 15:36.935
to exhume her body.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.307
Absolutely not.

15:38.308 --> 15:40.209
(Police radio chatter)

15:40.210 --> 15:42.371
I thought you were trying
to capture Caroline's killer,

15:42.372 --> 15:44.243
not desecrate her grave.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.145
I will treat her with respect,

15:46.146 --> 15:47.446
I assure you.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.448
I just want to make sure
that justice was served,

15:49.449 --> 15:51.721
as I'm sure you do also.

15:53.723 --> 15:57.126
Robert Riley was and is guilty,

15:57.127 --> 15:58.427
end of story.

15:58.428 --> 16:03.332
Is there any reason you
wouldn't want her exhumed?

16:03.333 --> 16:06.195
You are way out of line.

16:06.196 --> 16:09.498
Dr. Murphy, I don't
know what game

16:09.499 --> 16:14.343
your office is playing here,
but it needs to end, right now.

16:14.344 --> 16:16.405
My sincere apologies,

16:16.406 --> 16:18.478
to both of you.

16:22.412 --> 16:25.614
Harrington's probably already
on the phone with the d.A.

16:25.615 --> 16:27.186
What the hell were you thinking,

16:27.187 --> 16:28.357
waltzing into this house

16:28.358 --> 16:29.658
and harassing the
victim's husband?

16:29.659 --> 16:31.020
You come to me first.

16:31.021 --> 16:32.561
I heard you were here.
Two birds, one stone.

16:32.562 --> 16:34.263
(Sighs) How about
you just concentrate

16:34.264 --> 16:35.394
on doing your job, all right?

16:35.395 --> 16:38.427
Job? And what exactly
was your job here?

16:38.428 --> 16:40.329
This is about your
political career, isn't it?

16:40.330 --> 16:42.301
Harrington could be
a big booster for you.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.432
I am not the issue here.

16:43.433 --> 16:45.304
Riley was right.
Everybody's got an agenda.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.635
Riley?

16:46.636 --> 16:48.037
I spoke to him.

16:48.038 --> 16:49.208
You did what?

16:49.209 --> 16:52.010
He claims that harrington
murdered Caroline,

16:52.011 --> 16:53.442
and I'm beginning
to believe it's true.

16:53.443 --> 16:55.284
Did you see his reaction
to exhuming her body?

16:55.285 --> 16:57.186
You'd think he'd want to
know who really killed his wife.

16:57.187 --> 16:59.188
He already knows.
Riley did, all right?

16:59.189 --> 17:01.120
The man's trying to
move on with his life.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.222
Or he killed her
and framed Riley.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.554
Did you see that
wife of his? (Sighs)

17:05.555 --> 17:07.356
Sure didn't take him long
to trade in for the new model,

17:07.357 --> 17:08.697
did it?

17:08.698 --> 17:10.229
I need to exhume that body.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.760
Stop. All right? Just stop.

17:11.761 --> 17:13.432
No, I am not gonna
stop... (Cell phone ringing)

17:13.433 --> 17:15.304
Until I find out for sure
who killed Caroline.

17:15.305 --> 17:16.365
Great. It's the d.A. (Beeps)

17:16.366 --> 17:19.038
I'll deal with you later.

17:20.770 --> 17:22.141
(Cell phone rings and beeps)

17:22.142 --> 17:24.273
Yo, Tommy. What's up?

17:24.274 --> 17:26.415
(Tommy) Finally dug up a
current address on Brad Carter.

17:26.416 --> 17:28.317
Oh, the other
witness. (Pen clicks)

17:28.318 --> 17:30.319
He's doing better
than the first, I hope.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.681
I'm heading over to his
place on penrose and 19th.

17:32.682 --> 17:34.052
You got eyes on Megan?

17:34.053 --> 17:35.524
Yeah, she just went in

17:35.525 --> 17:37.055
to, uh, Emmett
harring... Whoa. Hey.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.258
I have a couple of questions
for Mr. Carter myself.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.690
You know what? Uh, Dr. Hunt...

17:41.691 --> 17:44.593
That's really not a...
That's not a good idea.

17:44.594 --> 17:47.766
You'd rather I meet you there?

17:47.767 --> 17:49.768
So you and Tommy,
uh, working together

17:49.769 --> 17:51.570
after all those years...

17:51.571 --> 17:53.603
Wild, right?

17:57.807 --> 18:00.579
Uh, what about your
daughter, uh, Lacey?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.712
How's she doing?

18:05.215 --> 18:06.615
All right. You know what?

18:06.616 --> 18:08.287
We're gonna be working together,

18:08.288 --> 18:10.288
so doesn't it make sense
to get to know each other?

18:12.662 --> 18:14.393
(Sighs)

18:14.394 --> 18:18.297
That's a $5,000 watch.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.199
On your salary?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.700
Rich girlfriend or rich parents?

18:21.701 --> 18:24.603
You tried to wash off the
club stamp from last night,

18:24.604 --> 18:27.105
but I can still see it, and
no guy with a girlfriend

18:27.106 --> 18:28.577
goes to a club on
a Wednesday night,

18:28.578 --> 18:30.339
so I'm gonna go
with rich parents.

18:30.340 --> 18:31.640
The question is,

18:31.641 --> 18:33.312
why would somebody who
comes from money become a cop?

18:33.313 --> 18:36.615
Act of rebellion or reaction
to trauma, which is it?

18:36.616 --> 18:38.417
Well, you know, maybe
the watch is a knockoff.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.588
It's not.

18:39.589 --> 18:40.749
All right, you know, I-I thought

18:40.750 --> 18:42.351
that you were
giving me a hard time

18:42.352 --> 18:44.323
because I work with Tommy,
but that's not the case, is it?

18:44.324 --> 18:46.325
No, you expect everyone
who flies around your airspace

18:46.326 --> 18:47.796
to bend over backwards
in serving your agenda.

18:47.797 --> 18:49.298
Well, you know
what? It's not my style.

18:49.299 --> 18:50.899
I'm a detective. You're an m.E.

18:50.900 --> 18:54.133
That means I work with
you. I don't work for you.

19:00.770 --> 19:02.641
Lacey's doing great.

19:02.642 --> 19:06.346
Thanks for asking.

19:14.254 --> 19:17.386
(Vehicle approaches)

19:17.387 --> 19:19.228
(Door opens)

19:19.229 --> 19:20.359
(Engine turns off)

19:20.360 --> 19:21.860
Uh... (Chuckles) Tommy, uh...

19:21.861 --> 19:24.263
Yeah, uh, hey, I told her
it was a bad idea, Tommy.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.365
And yet, she's here.
Listen, she got in the car

19:26.366 --> 19:27.536
when you were talking
to me on the phone.

19:27.537 --> 19:29.238
Mr. Carter, nice
to see you again.

19:29.239 --> 19:31.300
How you doing'?

19:31.301 --> 19:32.371
How you doin'?

19:32.372 --> 19:33.672
I'm detective Sullivan
from Philly p.D.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.204
This is detective Lucas. Hey.

19:35.205 --> 19:36.945
Yeah, I got your message
about Robert Riley.

19:36.946 --> 19:38.607
Am I in any sort of danger?

19:38.608 --> 19:40.409
(Tommy) Well, we just want
to put you under surveillance

19:40.410 --> 19:42.951
until he's apprehended
and returned to custody.

19:42.952 --> 19:45.254
Or until the right
man's apprehended.

19:45.255 --> 19:47.216
The right man?
Wh-what does she mean?

19:47.217 --> 19:48.817
You're just gonna
have to excuse her.

19:48.818 --> 19:50.359
Detective Lucas, could
you take him inside,

19:50.360 --> 19:51.560
explain to him the few steps?

19:51.561 --> 19:53.222
Yeah. So, uh, we're
gonna be positioning a man

19:53.223 --> 19:55.924
outside your house at all times.

19:55.925 --> 19:57.466
It's Riley. Watch out!

19:57.467 --> 20:00.499
Riley, stop the truck, now!

20:00.500 --> 20:01.901
(Gunshot) No, Tommy!

20:03.733 --> 20:04.974
What the hell are you doing?!

20:06.306 --> 20:08.377
(Tires squeal)

20:08.378 --> 20:10.340
(Engine revs, tires squeal)

20:15.685 --> 20:17.346
So the, uh, truck
was stolen, obviously.

20:17.347 --> 20:19.348
The, uh, the make, model, plate
number have been broadcast.

20:19.349 --> 20:20.849
Search grids are being set up.

20:20.850 --> 20:22.391
I mean, every
available eye in the city

20:22.392 --> 20:23.522
is looking for this guy.

20:23.523 --> 20:24.853
Nice work, Adam.

20:24.854 --> 20:26.355
All right.

20:26.356 --> 20:29.359
(Police radio chatter)

20:32.402 --> 20:33.732
Do you have any
idea how close I came

20:33.733 --> 20:36.505
to throwing your ass in
jail for obstruction of justice?

20:36.506 --> 20:38.267
So many things
could've gone wrong.

20:38.268 --> 20:39.408
What you did was
inexcusable... But it didn't.

20:39.409 --> 20:41.370
Reckless, irresponsible.

20:41.371 --> 20:44.473
Never, ever again.

20:44.474 --> 20:46.475
Wait. Wait.

20:46.476 --> 20:47.976
(People speaking indistinctly)

20:47.977 --> 20:50.349
Brad Carter lied on the
stand, and I can prove it.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.682
(Radio chatter continues)

20:55.585 --> 20:57.756
(Brad) 36.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.488
(Police radio chatter)

20:59.489 --> 21:01.730
16. Why am I doing this?

21:01.731 --> 21:03.332
What does this have
to do with anything?

21:03.333 --> 21:04.433
Good question.

21:04.434 --> 21:05.594
You'll know in a minute.

21:05.595 --> 21:06.935
What number do you see?

21:06.936 --> 21:10.470
(People speaking indistinctly)

21:13.403 --> 21:14.803
(Chuckles) That's
a trick question.

21:14.804 --> 21:16.345
There's no number there.

21:16.346 --> 21:18.407
Mr. Carter...

21:18.408 --> 21:20.809
That little micromovement
in your eye,

21:20.810 --> 21:22.511
it's called a nystagmus.

21:22.512 --> 21:24.713
It's often associated
with color blindness.

21:24.714 --> 21:26.415
Four years ago, you testified

21:26.416 --> 21:28.357
that you saw a man
wearing a red shirt

21:28.358 --> 21:30.058
matching Robert
Riley's description

21:30.059 --> 21:32.391
running from the
harringtons' guest house

21:32.392 --> 21:34.493
with blood on it.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.565
How'd you know
it was a red shirt

21:36.566 --> 21:38.527
if that color isn't even
in your visual spectrum?

21:38.528 --> 21:40.469
(Radio chatter continues)

21:40.470 --> 21:43.403
Did you perjure
yourself, Mr. Carter?

21:44.774 --> 21:46.775
I think I need to
talk to a lawyer.

21:46.776 --> 21:48.907
If you're covering
for harrington,

21:48.908 --> 21:50.909
it would be in your best
interest to talk to us now.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.682
I was under the impression
that when I asked for a lawyer,

21:53.683 --> 21:56.485
you people stop talking.

21:56.486 --> 21:58.787
(Radio chatter continues)

21:58.788 --> 22:02.421
Maybe harrington did
get to these witnesses.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.723
Still doesn't prove
Riley's innocent, though.

22:04.724 --> 22:08.457
I need to see
Caroline's body again.

22:08.458 --> 22:10.459
(Indistinct conversations)

22:10.460 --> 22:12.330
So I got a question for
you about the Riley case.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.362
Shoot.

22:13.363 --> 22:14.603
What do you think is worse,

22:14.604 --> 22:15.764
the fact that you almost
shot an innocent man

22:15.765 --> 22:17.536
or that Megan was the
one who stopped you?

22:17.537 --> 22:18.707
Very funny.

22:18.708 --> 22:20.409
Just because our
witness is color-blind

22:20.410 --> 22:21.840
doesn't mean
Riley's off the hook.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.011
No, but this might.

22:23.012 --> 22:24.373
What's this?

22:24.374 --> 22:25.744
Our color-blind
witness' bank account.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.416
A 6-figure deposit was made
a few weeks after the trial.

22:27.417 --> 22:28.877
Way to Bury the lede.

22:28.878 --> 22:30.519
What about the other witness?

22:30.520 --> 22:32.651
Same thing.

22:32.652 --> 22:33.952
It's a possible
payment for testimony.

22:33.953 --> 22:35.123
The money come from harrington?

22:35.124 --> 22:36.485
Not sure.

22:36.486 --> 22:38.657
Wire transfer was
made from the Caymans.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.989
I gotta contact over at
d.C.I. Who owes me a favor.

22:40.990 --> 22:42.491
I'm gonna give him a call.

22:42.492 --> 22:44.793
Oh, hey. I was just
wondering. Yeah.

22:44.794 --> 22:46.495
Are you gonna send
Megan an apology card

22:46.496 --> 22:48.136
or do you think flowers
are the way to go?

22:48.137 --> 22:49.638
You finished?

22:49.639 --> 22:53.542
'Cause I got actual real
police work to do here.

22:53.543 --> 22:55.073
(Indistinct conversations)

22:55.074 --> 22:56.575
You want to exhume
Caroline harrington?

22:56.576 --> 22:57.746
Are you serious?

22:57.747 --> 22:59.107
We can prove perjury.

22:59.108 --> 23:01.410
Because he may have
misidentified the color red?

23:01.411 --> 23:02.651
He clearly lied.

23:02.652 --> 23:05.454
Or just misspoke about a shirt.

23:05.455 --> 23:08.386
He still saw Riley
fleeing the murder scene.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.459
Well, how do you
explain the money?

23:10.460 --> 23:11.760
What money?

23:11.761 --> 23:12.991
My partner and I did some
digging in the financials.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.594
2 months after the trial,
Brad Carter got $100,000

23:15.595 --> 23:17.165
from an offshore account

23:17.166 --> 23:19.528
that I traced back
to Emmett harrington,

23:19.529 --> 23:21.000
same as the dead witness.

23:23.503 --> 23:24.803
Are you sure about this?

23:24.804 --> 23:26.676
Yes.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.810
The harrington name carries
more weight than you may realize.

23:31.811 --> 23:35.013
Once you turn this rock
over, you may not put it back.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.815
(Megan) Excuse me.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.817
What about the Philadelphia
medical examiner's office?

23:38.818 --> 23:41.419
Doesn't that name
carry any weight?

23:41.420 --> 23:42.891
Robert Riley went to prison

23:42.892 --> 23:45.093
because Emmett
harrington gamed the system,

23:45.094 --> 23:46.424
and we should've caught it.

23:46.425 --> 23:49.459
I should've caught it.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.864
(Kate) Dan, I
appreciate your advice.

23:55.865 --> 23:57.536
I do, but given what
they've turned up,

23:57.537 --> 23:59.969
I only have one choice.

24:05.174 --> 24:06.715
(Whispers) It's all clear.

24:06.716 --> 24:08.046
(Lowered voice)
Let's get in and get out

24:08.047 --> 24:10.849
before she sees us.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.481
(Curtis) Yeah,
put it on the desk.

24:12.482 --> 24:14.052
Now let's go. Okay.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.754
What are you doing in my office?

24:15.755 --> 24:16.955
(Normal voice) Just leaving.
(Normal voice) Uh, good night.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.527
You just put
something on my desk.

24:18.528 --> 24:19.688
Did I?

24:19.689 --> 24:20.889
See you tomorrow, Megan.

24:20.890 --> 24:22.030
Hold on. Hold on.

24:22.031 --> 24:24.032
(Paper rustles)

24:24.033 --> 24:25.894
This is the signed
exhumation order

24:25.895 --> 24:27.636
for Caroline harrington's body.

24:27.637 --> 24:28.897
We've gotta call the
funeral home, now.

24:28.898 --> 24:30.999
Tomorrow!

24:31.000 --> 24:33.001
(Exhales) Tomorrow,

24:33.002 --> 24:35.744
because the cemetery
is dangerous at night.

24:35.745 --> 24:37.676
I think what Ethan
meant to say is,

24:37.677 --> 24:39.247
with all the hours he's
been putting in as m.I.,

24:39.248 --> 24:41.950
Kate probably wouldn't approve
of all the additional overtime.

24:41.951 --> 24:44.553
So we won't ask Kate. Come on.

24:44.554 --> 24:47.185
(Pants) No, we...
we can't. We...

24:47.186 --> 24:49.518
We've got tickets tonight
to "raiders of the lost ark."

24:49.519 --> 24:51.489
It's a revival at center city.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.721
It's imax.

24:52.722 --> 24:53.892
70-millimeter print.

24:53.893 --> 24:56.024
Oh! Oh, okay.

24:56.025 --> 24:57.125
So it's okay?

24:57.126 --> 24:58.496
Yeah.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.568
Okay, let's go.

24:59.569 --> 25:00.629
Watching Harrison
Ford outrun a rock

25:00.630 --> 25:01.900
is infinitely more important

25:01.901 --> 25:04.072
than overturning a
wrongful murder conviction.

25:04.073 --> 25:06.204
It's not like an innocent man's
freedom is at stake or anything.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.236
You go. Go have fun.

25:08.237 --> 25:09.738
Okay. Let's... Let's
go have fun. Let's...

25:09.739 --> 25:13.041
On second thought,
we can skip it.

25:13.042 --> 25:15.814
Traitor.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.016
(Crickets chirping)

25:18.017 --> 25:20.018
(Curtis) What exactly are
we looking for on this body?

25:20.019 --> 25:22.190
(Megan) Something I
missed before, anything.

25:22.191 --> 25:23.291
Ah, spider! Spider!

25:23.292 --> 25:24.623
Oh, boy. (Scoffs) Oh, god.

25:24.624 --> 25:26.124
That's a domestic beetle.

25:26.125 --> 25:28.126
He doesn't want a
thing to do with you.

25:28.127 --> 25:29.598
He's looking to chow
down on some dead harri...

25:29.599 --> 25:32.100
Oh, hell. Flesh.

25:32.101 --> 25:33.932
Damn it. Open it now, please.

25:33.933 --> 25:36.565
Open it.

25:36.566 --> 25:39.037
(Curtis) Ohh.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.209
The casket was
supposed to be airtight.

25:41.210 --> 25:44.212
Yeah? Well, it looks
compromised, doesn't it?

25:44.213 --> 25:45.974
So much for new evidence, huh?

25:45.975 --> 25:47.545
So much for any evidence.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.648
We better find something

25:49.649 --> 25:52.151
before the police find Riley.

25:59.558 --> 26:03.592
So I put my reputation on
the line to exhume this body,

26:03.593 --> 26:05.233
and it turns out
there's barely a body.

26:05.234 --> 26:06.895
Please tell me you have a plan.

26:06.896 --> 26:08.937
The plan is to do
the best we can.

26:08.938 --> 26:11.339
This woman didn't get
justice four years ago.

26:11.340 --> 26:13.341
Let's not fail her today.

26:13.342 --> 26:14.843
"Cause of death...

26:14.844 --> 26:16.244
"exsanguination due to

26:16.245 --> 26:18.847
"a penetrating
sharp-force trauma

26:18.848 --> 26:21.610
with transection of
the ascending aorta."

26:21.611 --> 26:26.655
Blade entered between
second intercostal space,

26:26.656 --> 26:28.356
chipping an interior rib.

26:28.357 --> 26:29.788
Huh.

26:29.789 --> 26:33.622
The posterior
ribs weren't visible

26:33.623 --> 26:36.925
during the first autopsy due
to the soft overlaying tissue.

26:36.926 --> 26:40.369
So the beetles actually
helped give us a clear view.

26:49.308 --> 26:50.879
What is that?

26:50.880 --> 26:52.380
The original X-ray
didn't pick it up,

26:52.381 --> 26:54.643
so it must be the
same density as bone.

26:54.644 --> 26:57.846
Blended right in with her ribs.

26:57.847 --> 26:59.788
Dr. Murphy, I
believe this falls under

26:59.789 --> 27:02.091
your area of expertise.

27:08.627 --> 27:12.360
Honed edge. Looks like
it broke off something.

27:12.361 --> 27:15.364
(People speaking indistinctly)

27:18.407 --> 27:21.409
Yeah. This isn't human bone.

27:21.410 --> 27:22.911
It's got tubules instead
of haversian canals.

27:22.912 --> 27:24.242
That means it's from a tusk.

27:24.243 --> 27:25.714
As in ivory?

27:25.715 --> 27:27.976
Mm. And it's coated
with some kind of resin.

27:27.977 --> 27:31.079
Coated with resin,
sharpened edge...

27:31.080 --> 27:33.351
It's a knife.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.223
It's a fragment of
the murder weapon.

27:35.224 --> 27:37.856
Riley supposedly used a
wallboard saw made of steel.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.728
But the real killer
used an ivory blade...

27:39.729 --> 27:41.659
(Sighs) For the initial stab.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.431
And then put Riley's
saw in the wound track

27:43.432 --> 27:46.735
to frame him.

27:46.736 --> 27:48.096
(Scoffs)

27:48.097 --> 27:50.168
We had a piece of
the murder weapon

27:50.169 --> 27:52.440
right in front of us...

27:52.441 --> 27:53.842
And I missed it.

27:53.843 --> 27:55.443
Megan, nobody
could've seen that.

27:55.444 --> 27:57.145
Yeah? Try telling
that to the guy

27:57.146 --> 27:59.347
who's been in
prison for four years.

27:59.348 --> 28:01.449
We can't change the past.

28:01.450 --> 28:04.012
No.

28:04.013 --> 28:06.985
But we can set
the record straight,

28:06.986 --> 28:10.058
and that means
nailing harrington.

28:10.059 --> 28:11.219
All right.

28:11.220 --> 28:13.061
Well, his living room
looked like a museum.

28:13.062 --> 28:15.063
I mean, an ivory
knife would fit right in.

28:15.064 --> 28:16.725
I doubt he would open
his doors to us again

28:16.726 --> 28:19.928
without a warrant.

28:19.929 --> 28:22.931
You know, the d.A. Golfs
with half the judges in Philly.

28:22.932 --> 28:26.334
I could call him, see if he
can expedite the process.

28:26.335 --> 28:28.336
(Police radio chatter)

28:28.337 --> 28:30.378
The man who killed
Caroline's on the loose,

28:30.379 --> 28:32.080
and you want to search my house?

28:32.081 --> 28:33.241
Shouldn't be a problem

28:33.242 --> 28:34.482
unless you have
something to hide.

28:34.483 --> 28:35.414
What are you looking for?

28:35.415 --> 28:37.315
A murder weapon.

28:37.316 --> 28:38.788
(Radio chatter continues)

29:01.440 --> 29:04.413
(Police radio chatter)

29:06.315 --> 29:07.816
(Latch tinkles)

29:07.817 --> 29:11.420
(Radio chatter continues)

29:31.200 --> 29:34.502
This is the knife
that killed Caroline...

29:34.503 --> 29:36.304
Your knife.

29:36.305 --> 29:38.476
Mr. Harrington, you need to
come with me for questioning.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.348
That's absurd.

29:40.349 --> 29:42.010
I refuse.

29:42.011 --> 29:45.183
Then I'll arrest
you. It's your choice.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.416
Stacey, call my lawyer.

29:50.559 --> 29:53.262
You're gonna lose
your job over this.

29:58.467 --> 30:00.398
Harrington isn't talking.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.030
Can we put the
knife in his hands?

30:02.031 --> 30:03.201
Possibly.

30:03.202 --> 30:04.532
The crime lab pried off the hilt

30:04.533 --> 30:06.334
and found some dried blood.

30:06.335 --> 30:08.036
Here.

30:08.037 --> 30:09.537
Yeah, but is it Caroline's

30:09.538 --> 30:13.381
or did harrington knick
himself when he stabbed her?

30:13.382 --> 30:15.243
Well, only the
d.N.A. Test will tell.

30:15.244 --> 30:18.046
You need to stop what you're
doing immediately. Why?

30:18.047 --> 30:20.318
Harrington's attorney got
the knife evidence revoked.

30:20.319 --> 30:21.920
That's impossible. How?

30:21.921 --> 30:23.892
Our warrant encompassed
his legal residence,

30:23.893 --> 30:25.553
which technically, is
his house in Florida.

30:25.554 --> 30:26.925
(Scoffs)

30:26.926 --> 30:28.226
We never had a right
to enter the house,

30:28.227 --> 30:30.258
so anything found on
our search is inadmissible.

30:30.259 --> 30:33.501
Apparently, the richer you are,
the more justice you can afford.

30:33.502 --> 30:34.903
Mm-hmm.

30:34.904 --> 30:36.464
Wasn't your buddy Dan
helping you with this?

30:36.465 --> 30:38.506
Yeah.

30:38.507 --> 30:40.508
Guess it's pretty obvious
who he really helped.

30:40.509 --> 30:43.412
(People speaking indistinctly)

30:45.544 --> 30:47.475
Call the lab, tell them
the blood on that knife...

30:47.476 --> 30:49.077
Top priority.

30:49.078 --> 30:51.420
But Kate just
told... I don't care.

30:53.883 --> 30:55.053
(Cell phone rings)

30:55.054 --> 30:56.224
(Sighs)

30:56.225 --> 30:57.585
(Ring)

30:57.586 --> 30:59.027
(Rings and beeps)

30:59.028 --> 31:00.188
Megan hunt.

31:00.189 --> 31:01.559
(Riley) What happened
with harrington?

31:01.560 --> 31:03.561
Riley. The news report said

31:03.562 --> 31:05.263
he's being released
from police custody.

31:05.264 --> 31:06.534
Yeah.

31:06.535 --> 31:08.336
His attorney found a loophole.

31:08.337 --> 31:09.467
So he goes free

31:09.468 --> 31:11.900
and my conviction
stands? For now.

31:11.901 --> 31:13.441
Just hold on
for a little longer.

31:13.442 --> 31:15.303
I've held on long enough.

31:15.304 --> 31:17.145
He's already taken
everything from me.

31:17.146 --> 31:19.347
Don't do anything
you're gonna regret.

31:19.348 --> 31:21.349
Justice will be served...

31:21.350 --> 31:24.383
One way or the other.

31:26.185 --> 31:27.885
Riley.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.418
(Exhales)

31:38.127 --> 31:39.327
(Indistinct conversations)

31:39.328 --> 31:40.498
Tactical unit's in
position. We're going in.

31:40.499 --> 31:43.202
(Man) You go around
back with the locals.

31:45.134 --> 31:47.076
(Woman) Left side!

31:48.437 --> 31:50.578
(Police radio chatter)

31:50.579 --> 31:53.041
(Cell phone rings)

31:53.042 --> 31:54.642
(Rings and beeps)

31:54.643 --> 31:56.985
Not a good time, Ethan.

31:56.986 --> 31:58.987
You're gonna want to hear
what I have to say. I promise.

31:58.988 --> 32:01.050
Listen. I just got the
d.N.A. Report on the knife.

32:03.092 --> 32:05.154
How do you live with yourself?

32:06.555 --> 32:09.297
Can't we just talk about
this like reasonable men?

32:09.298 --> 32:10.528
Riley!

32:10.529 --> 32:14.103
Step away from Mr. Harrington
and drop your gun!

32:16.105 --> 32:18.236
Stay back. (Pants)

32:18.237 --> 32:19.337
I'll pull the trigger.

32:19.338 --> 32:21.970
No! Riley, no.

32:21.971 --> 32:25.673
(Panting)

32:25.674 --> 32:28.216
Riley, don't do this.

32:28.217 --> 32:30.078
This isn't you. I
know it's not you.

32:30.079 --> 32:31.249
You're not a killer.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.451
I'll shoot him. I will.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.453
He's gotten away
with this long enough.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.125
You don't understand.

32:37.126 --> 32:38.956
He did not kill Caroline.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.058
Yes, he did!

32:40.059 --> 32:41.630
No, I have proof.

32:43.362 --> 32:44.692
No.

32:44.693 --> 32:47.065
(Inhales) No, you're bluffing.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.496
Riley.

32:48.497 --> 32:51.469
Riley, look at me. Look at me.

32:51.470 --> 32:55.043
You came to me.

32:55.044 --> 32:56.974
You asked for my help

32:56.975 --> 32:59.307
because I was honest.

32:59.308 --> 33:01.309
I am telling you the truth.

33:01.310 --> 33:03.381
There isn't any more time. No!

33:03.382 --> 33:06.285
Don't! (Pants)

33:08.387 --> 33:10.358
Please.

33:10.359 --> 33:12.190
Robert...

33:12.191 --> 33:14.422
I believed in you.

33:14.423 --> 33:17.425
I believed in you
when nobody else did.

33:17.426 --> 33:21.300
And I'm asking you right now...

33:24.073 --> 33:27.176
Believe me.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.345
(Mouths word)

33:37.346 --> 33:39.517
Okay.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.189
(Exhales) Okay.

33:41.190 --> 33:42.420
(Sets gun down)

33:42.421 --> 33:46.124
(Man) All right. Get
down. Do not move.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.326
(Man) Put your hands
behind your back.

33:48.327 --> 33:50.328
(Handcuffs clicking)

33:50.329 --> 33:52.300
(Men speaking indistinctly)

33:52.301 --> 33:53.401
(Exhales)

33:53.402 --> 33:55.163
(Man) Come on.

33:55.164 --> 33:58.166
(Indistinct conversations)

33:58.167 --> 34:00.138
(Police radio chatter)

34:00.139 --> 34:02.310
(Emmett) Thank you
for what you did in there.

34:02.311 --> 34:04.312
It was artful.

34:04.313 --> 34:06.444
Yeah, I was wrong about you.

34:06.445 --> 34:09.317
You really didn't
kill your wife.

34:09.318 --> 34:12.450
The d.N.A. On the knife
showed two distinct samples.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.522
One was Caroline's, and...

34:14.523 --> 34:16.154
The other was female.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.485
(Engine starts)

34:17.486 --> 34:20.428
That belonged to
you. Am I correct?

34:20.429 --> 34:21.589
(Chuckles)

34:21.590 --> 34:23.531
(Scoffs) There you go again.

34:23.532 --> 34:25.293
As soon as you redeem yourself,

34:25.294 --> 34:27.765
you go and make
ridiculous accusations.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.567
I don't know about
ridiculous, but four years ago,

34:29.568 --> 34:31.399
somebody used
one of your accounts

34:31.400 --> 34:33.201
to give all the
witnesses in Riley's trial

34:33.202 --> 34:35.303
$100,000 each.

34:35.304 --> 34:36.774
What?

34:36.775 --> 34:39.377
Are you sure?

34:39.378 --> 34:41.409
(Megan) We figured, since
you were his assistant then,

34:41.410 --> 34:43.451
you had access to that account.

34:43.452 --> 34:47.385
Honey, please tell
them you didn't do it.

34:47.386 --> 34:49.557
(People speaking indistinctly)

34:49.558 --> 34:51.759
Stacey?

34:51.760 --> 34:53.591
That's okay.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.163
That's fine. We'll...

34:55.164 --> 34:58.396
Get ahold of the checks,
look at the signatures,

34:58.397 --> 35:00.428
run them for trace,

35:00.429 --> 35:02.830
and that should lead us to...

35:02.831 --> 35:05.204
Who, do you think?

35:09.378 --> 35:12.840
Say something.

35:12.841 --> 35:14.413
Stacey!

35:16.285 --> 35:18.616
Caroline wasn't faithful to you,

35:18.617 --> 35:21.319
but I knew that you
would never leave her.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.391
But...

35:23.392 --> 35:26.224
You... you didn't kill her?

35:26.225 --> 35:29.698
She didn't love you
the way that I do.

35:34.463 --> 35:36.364
(Handcuffs jangle)

35:36.365 --> 35:37.505
(Handcuffs clicking)

35:37.506 --> 35:39.367
But I did it for you.

35:39.368 --> 35:41.639
I did it for you.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.643
(Police radio chatter)

35:51.250 --> 35:53.551
So she killed Marcus, too?

35:53.552 --> 35:55.253
You're sure?

35:55.254 --> 35:57.425
We found the gun
in Stacey's car.

35:57.426 --> 36:00.188
She framed Riley for
Caroline's murder four years ago,

36:00.189 --> 36:02.560
then used his escape
to tie up loose ends,

36:02.561 --> 36:04.432
let him take the blame.

36:04.433 --> 36:07.365
(Huffs) I keep going
over and over...

36:07.366 --> 36:09.467
Every interaction, every...

36:09.468 --> 36:11.839
Conversation.

36:11.840 --> 36:14.202
The woman who did those things

36:14.203 --> 36:15.503
is not the woman I married.

36:15.504 --> 36:16.744
She... she can't be.

36:16.745 --> 36:18.606
Well, she went to great lengths

36:18.607 --> 36:20.308
to cover her crimes.

36:20.309 --> 36:22.381
By my side the whole time.

36:28.387 --> 36:30.187
When Caroline died,

36:30.188 --> 36:32.260
Stacey was there
to pick up the pieces.

36:32.261 --> 36:34.462
I thought she was my...

36:34.463 --> 36:36.295
My second chance.

36:38.467 --> 36:41.829
But it was all lies...

36:41.830 --> 36:43.872
Wasn't it?

36:45.734 --> 36:48.876
I'm very sorry for your
loss, Mr. Harrington.

36:48.877 --> 36:50.608
Both of them.

36:50.609 --> 36:52.681
(Sighs)

36:54.583 --> 36:57.445
Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

36:57.446 --> 37:00.849
I have a feeling that our
paths will cross again.

37:06.895 --> 37:10.899
(Blows air)

37:12.461 --> 37:14.462
Great work, Kate.

37:14.463 --> 37:16.334
You helped exonerate
an innocent man

37:16.335 --> 37:18.466
and uncovered the true culprit.

37:18.467 --> 37:19.637
I really think that
should become

37:19.638 --> 37:20.808
part of your campaign narrative.

37:20.809 --> 37:22.570
Oh, of course you do.

37:22.571 --> 37:23.911
Talk about it more at dinner?

37:23.912 --> 37:25.273
Oh, thanks, but not tonight.

37:25.274 --> 37:26.514
I've got some
work to catch up on.

37:26.515 --> 37:28.476
If you say so.

37:28.477 --> 37:29.917
O-One second. I...

37:29.918 --> 37:32.751
Just wanted to clear
one thing up with you.

37:34.283 --> 37:35.683
(Sighs) The warrant
for Emmett's house,

37:35.684 --> 37:37.925
the one you helped
push through...

37:37.926 --> 37:39.857
Did you know it's not
his legal residence?

37:39.858 --> 37:42.390
(Inhales deeply)

37:42.391 --> 37:45.893
I think what matters most
here is that, in the end,

37:45.894 --> 37:48.497
a killer was brought to justice.

37:49.998 --> 37:53.402
Without sacrificing any of
your lucrative friendships.

37:54.643 --> 37:56.675
Good night, Kate.

38:09.318 --> 38:11.018
(Siren wailing)

38:11.019 --> 38:12.590
(Elevator bell dings)

38:12.591 --> 38:16.695
(People speaking indistinctly)

38:20.569 --> 38:24.302
(Speaks indistinctly)

38:33.512 --> 38:35.883
So what are you doing here?

38:35.884 --> 38:38.716
I just... i dropped
off my report.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.588
In person?

38:40.589 --> 38:42.521
You're waiting for Riley.

38:45.354 --> 38:48.796
The funeral home's going to
inter Caroline's body next week,

38:48.797 --> 38:51.359
and... I just thought
he might want to know.

38:51.360 --> 38:52.730
Mm.

38:52.731 --> 38:55.062
I owe him that.

38:55.063 --> 38:57.064
You proved the guy's innocence.

38:57.065 --> 38:59.438
Your debt is paid and then some.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.511
You need to forgive
yourself, Megan.

39:03.512 --> 39:05.443
(Chuckles)

39:05.444 --> 39:07.044
Yeah.

39:07.045 --> 39:09.577
That's not exactly
my strong suit.

39:09.578 --> 39:11.380
Yeah, I noticed.

39:31.139 --> 39:34.372
I didn't get to
go to her funeral.

39:37.946 --> 39:39.447
I'm sure there's a lot of things

39:39.448 --> 39:42.611
you didn't get to do
the last four years.

39:44.753 --> 39:46.454
I had way too much time

39:46.455 --> 39:48.787
to go over and over
what happened...

39:50.388 --> 39:52.661
The choices that I made.

39:54.062 --> 39:55.823
Caroline and I
didn't get together

39:55.824 --> 39:59.497
under the best circumstances...

39:59.498 --> 40:03.471
If only we'd done
everything above board...

40:03.472 --> 40:04.732
Robert,

40:04.733 --> 40:08.436
you have to stop
blaming yourself.

40:08.437 --> 40:10.037
(Crying)

40:10.038 --> 40:12.010
I-I don't know if I can.

40:18.647 --> 40:20.748
But thank you.

40:20.749 --> 40:22.490
Oh.

40:22.491 --> 40:25.192
Don't thank me.

40:25.193 --> 40:28.425
Caroline is the one
that had the evidence

40:28.426 --> 40:30.558
that led to your exoneration.

40:30.559 --> 40:33.701
She'd been holding
on to it for four years,

40:33.702 --> 40:36.133
waiting to tell her story,

40:36.134 --> 40:38.466
and I am just grateful that

40:38.467 --> 40:41.439
I finally was able to hear it.

40:46.715 --> 40:50.217
I hope that you both...

40:50.218 --> 40:52.821
Can move on.
