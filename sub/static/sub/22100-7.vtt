00:02.044 --> 00:04.629
(DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

00:22.564 --> 00:24.941
NO. 6: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.818
I'm giving you a ship.

00:26.902 --> 00:27.944
Now go.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.654
Find a way to Earth.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.866
LEOBEN: Kara, I'm alone. This is
not an attack. I knew I'd find you.

00:33.951 --> 00:34.909
Leoben?

00:34.993 --> 00:38.246
I'm here to offer a truce
between human and Cylon,

00:38.372 --> 00:40.123
and a chance for you
to complete your journey.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.582
LEOBEN: The Hybrid.

00:41.667 --> 00:44.252
You need to go to her, Kara.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.170
She'll tell you the way
to get to Earth.

00:46.714 --> 00:49.298
We're done here.
Get him out of here.

00:49.425 --> 00:51.426
We're ready to jump back
to the Fleet on your order.

00:51.510 --> 00:52.552
We're not going back
to the Fleet.

00:52.636 --> 00:55.221
Capt. Thrace,
as XO of the Demetrius,

00:55.305 --> 00:57.265
I'm hereby relieving you
of command.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.142
You son of a bitch.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.477
SAM: Gaeta, abort the jump!

01:02.062 --> 01:04.272
(GROANING)

01:05.774 --> 01:07.066
I'm gonna take Leoben
back to the Baseship,

01:07.151 --> 01:08.234
see if his story
checks out.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.902
We'll be waiting here
till the clock runs out.

01:10.821 --> 01:13.072
ATHENA: Looks like he wasn't
lying about a civil war.

01:13.323 --> 01:16.576
This is it. The comet. It's the ship!

01:16.660 --> 01:18.244
Thus will it come to pass.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.705
You are the harbinger
of death, Kara Thrace.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.415
You will lead them all
to their end.

01:25.669 --> 01:26.669
HOTDOG: Cylon Baseship.

01:26.754 --> 01:27.920
ATHENA: Demetrius, Athena.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.255
The Baseship is ours.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.882
Then let's go home.

01:36.180 --> 01:39.265
BALTAR ON TAPE: Now I have
learned from unimpeachable sources

01:39.516 --> 01:42.518
that President Laura Roslin
has for some time now

01:42.603 --> 01:47.690
been sharing hallucinogenic visions
with two Cylons within our Fleet.

01:47.775 --> 01:52.028
One Sharon Agathon, sent on the
classified Demetrius mission,

01:52.112 --> 01:55.615
and the other a Cylon prisoner
being held aboard the...

01:56.450 --> 01:58.451
It's not that easy,
Madam President.

01:58.535 --> 01:59.869
No? You should
try it sometime.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.662
Most of the population has
heard that broadcast.

02:01.747 --> 02:04.123
I would assume
that's the point.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.835
Look, I take no pleasure
in putting this before you.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.837
In fact, they practically had
to push me through that door.

02:09.922 --> 02:11.547
Well, I'm sure you're
quite happy to stay.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.299
I can't put one foot
in front of another

02:13.383 --> 02:17.804
without someone blocking my path,
asking me what the hell is going on!

02:17.888 --> 02:19.055
For the welfare
of the Fleet...

02:19.139 --> 02:20.139
Excuse me.

02:20.224 --> 02:22.141
As long as I am
in this office,

02:22.226 --> 02:27.230
the welfare of this Fleet is not
something you need to worry about.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.982
You owe
the people a response.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.776
I owe the people?

02:31.860 --> 02:32.860
(CHUCKLES)

02:33.070 --> 02:34.153
That's what I believe.

02:34.238 --> 02:36.239
What if suddenly all your
beliefs were called into question?

02:36.323 --> 02:37.323
Madam President...

02:37.407 --> 02:38.825
Up is down.
Black is white.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.368
Scripture is fiction.

02:40.452 --> 02:43.371
Home is thin air instead
of solid ground, et cetera.

02:43.455 --> 02:46.916
You know, I'm really sorry for
everything you've had to endure.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.125
I really am.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.336
But the people,
they deserve a response.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.420
Do they?

02:51.505 --> 02:53.840
Is there any truth
to this broadcast?

02:53.924 --> 02:56.926
And what would you do
if I told you the truth?

02:57.010 --> 02:58.594
What if it were you
instead of me

02:58.679 --> 03:02.014
and all that's left of
humanity has just been told

03:02.099 --> 03:04.684
that you are sharing visions
with the enemy?

03:04.768 --> 03:06.102
What would you do,
Mr. Adama?

03:06.186 --> 03:08.563
Would you think that
the Gods were testing you?

03:09.565 --> 03:11.941
So Baltar
is telling the truth?

03:14.236 --> 03:16.195
Is it true?

03:16.280 --> 03:17.446
Yes.

03:33.714 --> 03:37.383
Demetrius reports their sysops will
be synced with ours in five minutes.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.553
When you came knocking with that
Raider and asked for our help,

03:40.637 --> 03:42.555
you gave away the future of
all the Cylons aboard this ship.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.640
You know that, right? I
gave it to the right person.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.684
Save it.
No guarantees.

03:47.102 --> 03:48.144
When we meet up
with the Colonial Fleet,

03:48.228 --> 03:50.646
I don't know if they'll feed
you or frak you, all right?

03:50.814 --> 03:52.899
Since you've been calling
the plays up till now,

03:52.983 --> 03:55.651
I'm assuming
you're doing the talking.

03:56.194 --> 03:58.738
Good. Gods help us.

04:07.789 --> 04:11.500
Sysops of both vessels are synced.
We're as ready as we're ever gonna be.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.420
Good. Tell the Demetrius
to set the board to green.

04:14.504 --> 04:18.382
Unless both ships jump in together,
Galactica will blow us out of the sky.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.979
ATHENA ON RADIO: Demetrius,
Athena. Set your board to green.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.696
Athena, Demetrius.
Starting to green.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.573
Let's round the Horn, guys.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.241

04:52.709 --> 04:54.126
Spun up. Go.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.421
Athena, Demetrius.
Board is green.

05:00.008 --> 05:03.052
I was just thinking
how beautiful she must be.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.888
Your daughter, Hera.

05:08.809 --> 05:09.850
How do you know her name?

05:09.935 --> 05:11.560
We all know her name.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.270
You were blessed.

05:14.606 --> 05:17.149
All right, everyone.
Let's go home.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.737
Demetrius, Athena.
Execute jump.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.198
Clock is running.

05:24.282 --> 05:27.743
Ten, nine, eight,

05:28.495 --> 05:31.831
seven, six, five,

05:32.624 --> 05:37.086
four, three, two. Jump.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.345
SEELIX: Sir, we had a problem with the
sync points and the jump coordinates.

05:46.430 --> 05:49.974
It'll take a few minutes to
spool up the FTL drive again.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.393
HELO: Gods damn it!

05:59.276 --> 06:01.068

06:05.407 --> 06:08.075
Get me some more
frakking birds in the air!

06:08.243 --> 06:11.454
Gun batteries stand by
for target bearing!

06:18.712 --> 06:20.755
Demetrius, Athena. Report.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.216
Demetrius, Athena. Report.

06:24.301 --> 06:28.763
Baseship bearing 333,
carom 498 at 15 MSU.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.556
Frakking thing is sitting
right on top of us.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.768
Mr. Hoshi, order the Fleet
to make an emergency jump!

06:33.852 --> 06:35.728
HOSHI: Aye, sir. All Colonial
vessels jump immediately

06:35.812 --> 06:38.397
to emergency
rendezvous coordinates.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.107
Sir, the President's
shuttle is en route.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.485
ADAMA: Tell them to land on
Landing Bay 1. Checkers green.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.743
Galactica, Athena.
Galactica, Athena.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.373
Last jump must've cooked the
wireless. We've got no com.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.375
They can't hear us.
Frak.

07:06.468 --> 07:08.094
Galactica's scrambling
Vipers.

07:08.220 --> 07:09.762
They're going
to shoot us down.

07:14.518 --> 07:16.018
What the frak?

07:21.274 --> 07:23.692
ATHENA: Eight Vipers inbound.
Entering firing range.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.195
STARBUCK: Where the hell
is the Demetrius?

07:29.324 --> 07:30.991
MAN: Baseship targeted.
Weapons free.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.618
Something isn't right.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.912
Gunnery reporting.
Firing solution correct.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.914
Main battery standing by
to fire on your command.

07:39.876 --> 07:43.003
On my command.
Three, two,

07:43.463 --> 07:45.214
one.
Weapons hold!

07:57.018 --> 07:58.561
DUALLA: Dradis contact!

07:59.312 --> 08:01.480
HELO ON RADIO: Galactica,
Demetrius, do not fire.

08:01.565 --> 08:05.568
Baseship is disarmed and under
Colonial command. Officers aboard.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.487
Demetrius, Galactica.
Authenticate.

08:10.323 --> 08:14.201
Galactica, Demetrius. I
authenticate. Bravo, tango, eight.

08:14.286 --> 08:18.122
Do not fire. Starbuck and Athena
have control of the Baseship.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.294
(THEME MUSIC)

09:19.476 --> 09:21.185
MAN: Move! Move! Move!

09:53.176 --> 09:55.803
STARBUCK:
Colonel, they're with me.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.348
They're with you?

10:11.820 --> 10:14.154
So which one of them
shot Gaeta?

10:15.532 --> 10:17.616
MAN: Lt. Gaeta,
stay with us.

10:18.702 --> 10:19.952
All right,
everybody stand back.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.371
And get a cut down tray
in here right now.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.042
We became divided
according to models.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.211
The Twos, Eights and Sixes

10:30.088 --> 10:34.675
have come to believe that our destiny
lies in seeking out the Final Five.

10:35.051 --> 10:38.637
The Ones, Fours and Fives
violently opposed such action.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.974
We know that there are seven
different models of Cylons.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.934
You only mentioned six.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.520
The Threes. The D'Annas.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.647
They were boxed after the
battle on the Algae Planet.

10:48.732 --> 10:49.815
Boxed?

10:49.899 --> 10:52.067
Her entire line was
punitively deactivated,

10:52.694 --> 10:56.280
her consciousness placed
in a boxing facility.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.240
Why?

10:59.075 --> 11:02.828
D'Anna saw the faces of the
Final Five, which was forbidden.

11:03.079 --> 11:06.749
But if we unbox her, she can
reveal their identities to us.

11:07.751 --> 11:10.169
The Final Five
have been to Earth.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.881
If we help find them,
they can help us get there.

11:15.258 --> 11:16.550
NATALIE: Our ship
can heal itself.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.219
But most of our Raiders
were destroyed in the ambush.

11:19.304 --> 11:22.014
We're asking for your help
here. We can't do it alone.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.266
What could possibly
motivate us to trust you now?

11:24.351 --> 11:26.018
What have you got?

11:27.520 --> 11:32.066
The boxing facility resides
within the Cylon resurrection hub.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.027
This hub controls
the functions

11:35.111 --> 11:37.571
of every Resurrection ship
in existence.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.866
It protects itself by periodically
jumping to a new set of coordinates

11:40.950 --> 11:42.868
and then relaying them
back to the Baseship.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.620
Madam President,

11:46.331 --> 11:48.791
you asked for a reason
to help us.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.459
Vengeance.

11:52.504 --> 11:56.715
You destroy the hub, Cylons
lose their ability to download.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.010
All of us.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.766
Why would you be willing to
lose your ability to resurrect?

12:05.850 --> 12:08.852
We're rebels.
We can't go back.

12:10.939 --> 12:14.066
What matters most to us
is being with the Five.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.611
D'Anna will be able
to identify them.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.990
We'll take you to the hub
if you help us unbox D'Anna.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.038
Give us the coordinates
of the hub first.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.958
No, I won't do that. I said
we would take you there.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.293
Take her out.
We're finished.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.671
Wait.

12:35.839 --> 12:38.924
Is your word good, Admiral?
I'll give you the coordinates.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.175
But I want your word.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.468
Stand down.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.307
You have my word.

12:47.392 --> 12:51.353
Once their identities are
revealed and we come back here,

12:52.272 --> 12:55.357
we'll be free to leave
your Fleet with the Five.

12:57.527 --> 12:58.610
Yes.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.321
They're here with you.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.118
The Final Five
are in your Fleet.

13:06.244 --> 13:10.038
That's why our Raiders turned
back the attack in the nebula.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.131
The weapons hold.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.467
How the frak
did you see that?

13:22.218 --> 13:26.346
To be absolutely honest
with you, Bill, I didn't.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.851
What can I say?
We got lucky.

13:35.565 --> 13:40.402
Well, let's get a Raptor up to those
coordinates that that Cylon gave us.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.863
Maybe we can
get lucky again.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.156
Sir.

13:46.784 --> 13:47.910
Tigh.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.371
Thank you.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.136
RACETRACK: Lords of Kobol,
shield your eyes.

14:08.556 --> 14:11.350
Get it with the gun camera.
Hit override.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.313
Kind of pretty,
isn't it?

14:16.397 --> 14:17.606
Tell it to the Fleet.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.838
No. No. Don't put me under. Please.

14:42.257 --> 14:44.466
Just... Just numb everything.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.177
Felix.
Just do it. I...

14:47.262 --> 14:48.637
I don't want to wake up...

14:49.389 --> 14:51.431
I don't want to wake up
with my leg gone.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.769
Okay, son.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.695
If we go in on our own horse,
we won't last five minutes.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.197
But we go in with that
Baseship parked out there,

15:49.282 --> 15:50.449
nobody's gonna
notice us for a while.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.868
What do we fight with?
Their Raiders are frakked.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.162
We don't use theirs.
We use ours.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.538
Take half the Viper wing.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.123
Half the wing?
Yes.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.125
We'll sneak them in
on the rebel Baseship.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.794
Hoshi did some calculations
from Racetrack's photos.

16:02.879 --> 16:05.422
We take out the FTL
and the hub's stranded.

16:05.506 --> 16:10.135
We blow the hub and billions of
skin jobs lose their bath privileges.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.012
Imagine.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.474
Once they're gone,
they can't come back.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.100
Mortal enemies.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.980
Before we blow the hub, we need
to get a team in to unbox D'Anna.

16:22.065 --> 16:24.358
Well, now,
maybe we just don't.

16:25.234 --> 16:28.320
Maybe we just forget
the Godsdamn boxing facility.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.488
Lie to the rebels.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.573
TIGH: Well,
they're lying to us.

16:32.075 --> 16:36.328
The skin jobs said their Raiders won't
fight because the Final Five is here?

16:36.412 --> 16:40.791
We tangled with those slit-eyed
black bastards for three years now,

16:40.875 --> 16:43.627
and they haven't turned
back before. Why now?

16:43.711 --> 16:46.546
What if they're telling the truth?
What if the Final Five are here?

16:46.631 --> 16:48.340
The Five could know
the way to Earth.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.008
If they knew, they're
not gonna lead us there

16:50.093 --> 16:53.095
after we've just destroyed
their resurrection capacity.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.097
Maybe they're different,
like the rebels.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.473
ROSLIN: What if they're not?

16:56.557 --> 16:59.017
What if their sole purpose
is to destroy us?

16:59.102 --> 17:02.396
I say we blow the whole
Godsdamn thing to dust,

17:02.480 --> 17:06.066
lock, stock and barrel, and
trust the President's vision.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.152
Her scriptures,
her way to Earth.

17:09.612 --> 17:10.946
Why don't we split
the difference?

17:11.030 --> 17:13.156
Unbox D'Anna
and find the Five.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.534
Keep the Five till we get to
Earth. Turn them over to the rebels.

17:15.618 --> 17:18.745
They've waited this long.
It'll be on our terms.

17:19.455 --> 17:24.126
It's all pie in the sky, gentlemen,
until we know what's true and what's not.

17:25.128 --> 17:28.422
And we put a lid on it. The
real plan stays in this room.

17:28.506 --> 17:31.967
If the plan gets leaked to
the Cylons, all bets are off.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.553
ADAMA: Have someone escort the
rebel leader back to her Baseship

17:34.637 --> 17:37.639
so she can inform her people
they have a deal.

18:06.294 --> 18:10.922
"In 36 hours, the Colonies will unite
forces with insurgent rebel Cylons

18:11.466 --> 18:13.175
"and their leader

18:13.259 --> 18:16.636
"in an unprecedented
joint military operation

18:16.721 --> 18:21.391
"to destroy the Cylons'
ability to download into

18:22.435 --> 18:24.186
"blah, blah, blah. "

18:27.607 --> 18:30.025
Why weren't we consulted?

18:35.364 --> 18:38.575
I'm sorry. I'm in the dark
as much as all of you.

18:43.372 --> 18:47.626
You know, if they unbox the D'Annas, at
least we'll find out who the fifth one is.

18:47.710 --> 18:50.337
TIGH: All that's gonna do is
crowd the airlock a little more.

18:50.421 --> 18:54.800
Do you think they're gonna give you a
medal when they find out who you are?

18:54.884 --> 18:56.384
What about you?

18:56.719 --> 18:58.470
He sings, you know.

19:00.348 --> 19:01.890
What?
Gaeta.

19:03.726 --> 19:07.771
Whenever he feels the tingling.
Whenever he feels his phantom leg.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.732
Cottle says it helps him get through it.

19:17.448 --> 19:18.740
He sings.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.539
Good morning.

19:30.086 --> 19:31.336
Morning.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.844
What is it about the Galactica
that gives you such a glow?

19:38.928 --> 19:42.222
I come over here, it's like I'm
going from one dungeon to the next.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.432
Oh, I hadn't noticed.
But thank you.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.101
You ready?
Yes.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.980
I want you to find out who's
behind the shared vision rumors.

19:50.064 --> 19:51.731
Who's talking to him?

19:51.816 --> 19:52.983
With Baltar?

19:53.067 --> 19:54.901
You're sleeping
with him, right?

19:58.406 --> 19:59.573
Don't.

20:02.243 --> 20:04.870
I've just been informed that
you've been spotted down there

20:04.954 --> 20:08.456
enough times to be a charter
member of his nymph squad.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.174
All right.

20:19.135 --> 20:24.639
I have come to believe
in Baltar's spiritual message.

20:25.308 --> 20:28.143
I don't know how or why.
It just happened.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.521
I wish you knew how many
times I wanted to tell you.

20:33.024 --> 20:35.233
Your friendship
and your trust means...

20:35.318 --> 20:36.401
Frak.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.490
Clearly my friendship
and trust mean frak.

20:43.367 --> 20:46.578
And I don't really care if you have to
spend the night on your knees praying

20:46.662 --> 20:48.413
or just on your knees.

20:48.497 --> 20:52.375
I want a name. I want to know
who's responsible for these lies.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.841
Madam President.

21:01.218 --> 21:04.387
Laura, I am so sorry.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.348
You have a job to do.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.573
The humans are never
going to allow us

21:23.658 --> 21:26.409
to have the Final Five
and go our own way.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.953
Are you sure of this?

21:28.037 --> 21:29.162
Not entirely.

21:30.206 --> 21:33.124
I'd rather be wrong.
But we need insurance.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.170
Trust has to begin
somewhere.

21:37.254 --> 21:40.423
Not with us.
It's our ship.

21:41.717 --> 21:45.428
When we jump, we take control
of it with the Centurions.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.473
We carry out the mission
as promised.

21:48.557 --> 21:53.103
But when we return,
we take hostages.

21:53.896 --> 21:57.899
The humans on this ship stay on
this ship until we have the Five.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.276
Look at me.

22:00.736 --> 22:03.363
We've changed,
but the humans haven't.

22:04.448 --> 22:08.159
We've come too far to risk
everything on their trust.

22:18.879 --> 22:24.384
(SINGING) Alone she sleeps
in the shirt of man

22:25.261 --> 22:28.096
With my three wishes

22:28.180 --> 22:32.225
Clutched in her hand

22:34.812 --> 22:40.358
The first that she be
spared the pain

22:40.443 --> 22:47.115
That comes from a dark
and laughing rain

22:49.535 --> 22:52.829
When she finds love

22:53.122 --> 22:55.415
May it always stay true

22:55.499 --> 22:58.793
ROSLIN: What a way to discover
such a beautiful voice, huh?

23:00.504 --> 23:02.172
How'd you find me?

23:02.798 --> 23:04.215
Your Chief of Staff.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.092
Needs to be horsewhipped.

23:06.177 --> 23:08.887
If you came down here to kiss
my ass to get information,

23:08.971 --> 23:09.971
save your breath.

23:11.474 --> 23:15.268
The Quorum's considering a vote
of no confidence against you.

23:22.526 --> 23:25.528
I won't compromise the
success of this operation

23:25.613 --> 23:28.239
or the safety
of this Fleet to indulge

23:28.783 --> 23:32.702
the neediness of 12 perpetually
unhappy representatives.

23:33.037 --> 23:34.287
I can't.

23:45.174 --> 23:48.093
I was with them
on the emergency jump.

23:50.513 --> 23:53.181
And I saw something
in the faces of the delegates.

23:53.265 --> 23:56.017
It wasn't the anxiety from
waiting. It went beyond that.

23:56.102 --> 23:59.687
I was anxious. It was my
first time. But they... They...

24:02.358 --> 24:03.942
They were empty.

24:04.527 --> 24:06.528
The Quorum had given up.

24:06.904 --> 24:08.988
And then it struck me that

24:09.365 --> 24:13.159
after going through the
same routine so many times,

24:15.079 --> 24:20.458
it was the only way that they
could cope with the uncertainty.

24:22.044 --> 24:23.878
To presume the worst.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.423
You felt their suffering.

24:29.051 --> 24:34.264
Now try holding their lives
in balance every day.

24:39.395 --> 24:40.895
Talk to them.

24:41.730 --> 24:44.065
You don't have to tell them
everything. I know how it works.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.984
Just talk to the Quorum.

24:46.068 --> 24:48.903
Let them put a face
to this joint mission.

24:49.572 --> 24:51.573
Let them hear
from the Cylon leader.

24:51.657 --> 24:52.991
Anything.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.618
Anything to put
their fears to rest.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.551
What's the matter?

25:14.346 --> 25:15.388
Nothing.

25:15.472 --> 25:16.764
No, nothing.
Nothing at all.

25:17.057 --> 25:19.517
We've been lying here
doing nothing.

25:19.602 --> 25:20.685
What?

25:25.441 --> 25:30.612
You've been lying about the
President sharing visions with Cylons.

25:33.115 --> 25:35.116
That happens to be
the God's honest truth.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.827
Sorry. I can't accept
what you've done.

25:37.912 --> 25:39.787
What... What I've done?

25:39.872 --> 25:41.915
What have I...
What are...

25:46.629 --> 25:48.213
Where's this coming from?

25:48.297 --> 25:50.173
These rumors you've started.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.887
I've seen what
they've done to her.

25:55.971 --> 25:59.140
You seriously believe
that I'm making all this up?

25:59.725 --> 26:02.894
I am not saying I'm not
capable, but why would I?

26:10.527 --> 26:12.153
Six revealed it.

26:14.198 --> 26:18.159
Caprica Six revealed them
to me through my attorney

26:19.870 --> 26:21.996
in the last days
of my trial

26:22.748 --> 26:25.375
when a guilty verdict
was a certainty.

26:28.504 --> 26:30.880
I suppose
I could've gone public.

26:30.965 --> 26:31.923
Caused a stir.

26:32.007 --> 26:34.217
And all this time,
you kept quiet.

26:38.097 --> 26:42.183
I'm not saying I'm a saint,
Tory. I'm many things.

26:44.561 --> 26:46.771
But I try not to be spiteful.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.524
Got no bloodlust
to go get her.

26:49.984 --> 26:53.236
But she's a hypocrite.
The lies.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.905
The secret missions.

26:57.366 --> 27:02.245
Co-opting the rhetoric of patriotism to
keep everyone in the dark, including you.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.540
That's rather worrying,
isn't it?

27:09.295 --> 27:10.962
So I had to speak.

27:13.215 --> 27:17.385
The truth is, no good ever
comes from concealing it.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.973
I've got a broadcast.

27:24.935 --> 27:30.690
(SINGING) The first that
she be spared the pain

27:31.150 --> 27:36.404
That comes from a dark
and laughing rain

27:42.077 --> 27:45.747
When she finds love

27:46.373 --> 27:49.584
May it always stay true

27:50.753 --> 27:56.632
This I beg for
the second wish I made, too

28:00.012 --> 28:05.183
I didn't come here to beg or plead
or apologize or to keep my job.

28:05.976 --> 28:07.226
You know me better
than that.

28:07.311 --> 28:12.148
And I didn't come here to curry sympathy
by parading my illness in front of you.

28:12.232 --> 28:15.651
On the contrary, there are
some that probably believe that,

28:15.736 --> 28:17.528
along with my cancer drugs,

28:17.613 --> 28:20.615
I have inoculated myself
against compassion.

28:22.451 --> 28:23.951
That is a joke.

28:27.206 --> 28:30.500
I am here because I want
to tell you face to face

28:30.584 --> 28:34.253
that I believe in this mission
and what it means for our future.

28:34.338 --> 28:38.216
I'm here to profess my trust
in our new allies.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.928
I'm here to ask you to listen.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.473
I'm here to ask
for your support.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.683
Bring her in.

29:20.843 --> 29:24.846
In our civil war,
we've seen death.

29:26.223 --> 29:29.350
We've watched our
people die. Gone forever.

29:29.935 --> 29:33.938
As terrible as it was beyond the
reach of the Resurrection ships,

29:34.898 --> 29:36.941
something began to change.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.028
We could feel
a sense of time,

29:41.113 --> 29:45.700
as if each moment
held its own significance.

29:47.453 --> 29:51.080
We began to realize
that for our existence

29:51.165 --> 29:54.333
to hold any value,
it must end.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.211
To live meaningful lives,

29:57.546 --> 30:00.631
we must die and not return.

30:02.009 --> 30:03.718
The one human flaw

30:04.720 --> 30:07.889
that you spend your lifetimes
distressing over...

30:09.391 --> 30:13.519
Mortality is the one thing...

30:15.939 --> 30:18.941
Well, it's the one thing
that makes you whole.

30:20.235 --> 30:24.155
I believe it was no accident
that we were found by Kara Thrace.

30:24.907 --> 30:26.449
It was destiny.

30:27.326 --> 30:30.411
She asked me to leave my
people, and I accepted.

30:31.246 --> 30:34.290
No matter what the sacrifice,
even if it should mean my death...

30:34.374 --> 30:35.625
Thus shall it come to pass.

30:35.709 --> 30:38.419
The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.422
You are the harbinger
of death, Kara Thrace.

30:47.221 --> 30:48.596
Our destiny.

30:49.932 --> 30:52.934
Our future.
Begins here.

31:01.193 --> 31:04.362
Thank you for giving me
the opportunity to speak.

31:06.532 --> 31:07.990
ADAMA: Take her out.

31:13.163 --> 31:15.957
(SINGING) But wish no more

31:17.459 --> 31:20.962
My life you can take

31:21.046 --> 31:24.215
To have her please

31:24.299 --> 31:27.218
Just one day wake

31:27.302 --> 31:32.473
To have her please

31:35.310 --> 31:36.310
(GRUNTS)

31:39.648 --> 31:44.652
Alone she sleeps
in the shirt of man

31:45.112 --> 31:48.990
With my three wishes
clutched in her hand

32:01.920 --> 32:03.004
Hera!

32:09.511 --> 32:10.511
(HERA GIGGLING)

32:11.013 --> 32:12.096
Hera.

32:35.787 --> 32:36.787
(GASPS)

32:56.558 --> 32:57.808
Bye-bye.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.333
I gotta hand it to you.

33:22.417 --> 33:25.252
If you are a Cylon,
that was a great plan.

33:26.463 --> 33:28.089
Dangle yet
another way to Earth.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.341
Throw in the hub,
the Final Five,

33:30.425 --> 33:33.386
and the real kicker, put
the Final Five on the Fleet.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.888
Even I couldn't
pass that one up.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.643
You are having those
visions, aren't you?

33:47.317 --> 33:49.443
Thus shall it come to pass.

33:50.737 --> 33:54.281
The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house.

33:59.454 --> 34:01.122
What did you say?

34:01.289 --> 34:02.748
Thus shall it come to pass.

34:02.833 --> 34:04.291
The opera house.

34:05.585 --> 34:09.130
The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house.

34:11.466 --> 34:14.969
Where did... Where did you
hear that? Who told you that?

34:15.929 --> 34:19.014
The Hybrid from the Baseship
before they unplugged it.

34:19.099 --> 34:20.474
The Hybrid.

34:21.476 --> 34:25.020
How does the Hybrid know
what's in my dream?

34:27.357 --> 34:28.858
I wish I knew.

34:34.781 --> 34:36.574
This has got to stop.

34:37.367 --> 34:40.911
These visions. I've got to
find out about these visions.

34:41.246 --> 34:42.872
I've got to know.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.628
Will you help me?

34:51.214 --> 34:52.298
Yes.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.012
Find Capt. Agathon.

35:03.518 --> 35:06.437
When I spoke to the Quorum,
I could feel it.

35:07.189 --> 35:08.522
The contempt.

35:08.607 --> 35:09.732
You were right.

35:10.859 --> 35:12.318
They're not ready
to trust us.

35:12.402 --> 35:14.028
No, I was wrong.

35:14.529 --> 35:17.531
We're not ready.
We're deceiving them.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.826
For protection.
For necessity.

35:20.911 --> 35:22.953
Out of suspicion and fear.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.665
Why haven't the Final Five
come forward?

35:26.750 --> 35:30.294
What if they're watching,
judging us on our actions?

35:30.378 --> 35:33.422
We're about to resort
to violence and coercion.

35:36.051 --> 35:39.470
What if they refuse to come
with us? We can't do this.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.474
It's too late.

35:44.893 --> 35:47.895
We have to order the
Centurions to stand down.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.064
It's too late.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.066
They're committed.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.485
Then we have to tell
the humans the truth.

35:54.569 --> 35:57.238
No, you can't do that.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.157
They'll never trust us again.

36:00.242 --> 36:03.994
They already know the coordinates.
They'll just go destroy everything.

36:04.246 --> 36:07.081
Go. Stall for time.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.543
Talk to Adama.
Tell him anything.

36:11.419 --> 36:14.839
Anything but the truth.
I'll deal with the Centurions.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.331
BALTAR: Of course.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.541
ROSLIN: Have a seat.

36:56.131 --> 36:58.090
We're going to
settle this now.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.341
What's to settle?

37:00.093 --> 37:03.095
Your Chief of Staff is
incomparably talented.

37:03.847 --> 37:07.474
I've been sharing visions with
Sharon Agathon and the Six.

37:08.977 --> 37:11.312
So I was only
speaking the truth.

37:11.396 --> 37:12.479
Yes.

37:12.981 --> 37:17.484
The Hybrid on the Baseship spoke of
an opera house and a dying leader.

37:18.528 --> 37:20.988
We're going to talk
to the Hybrid.

37:21.448 --> 37:24.074
And why would you
require my presence?

37:24.326 --> 37:26.535
Because you're in my visions.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.687
What are you doing, baby?

37:57.067 --> 37:58.692
Are you drawing?

38:01.905 --> 38:03.864
Can I see what you drew?

38:14.542 --> 38:15.709
Oh, no.

38:16.753 --> 38:19.004
No! No!

38:21.466 --> 38:22.466
No!

38:22.968 --> 38:25.427
Why? Why?

38:26.721 --> 38:27.972
Why?

38:29.182 --> 38:30.265
Hera?

38:31.643 --> 38:32.726
Hera?

38:38.400 --> 38:39.483
Hera!

38:58.670 --> 39:01.755
MAN ON RADIO: Raptor 124,
you are cleared for landing...

39:19.816 --> 39:21.066
Hera!

39:28.158 --> 39:30.451
Hera. Hera!

39:32.037 --> 39:33.037
Have you seen my daughter?

39:33.121 --> 39:34.747
No, I haven't.

39:34.831 --> 39:36.040
Hera!

39:37.083 --> 39:38.208
Hera!

39:54.184 --> 39:55.350
Hera!

39:58.646 --> 40:01.106
Hera! Hera.

40:01.816 --> 40:03.484
I can't find Hera.

40:06.446 --> 40:07.529
Hera!

40:51.616 --> 40:53.534
Get away from my child.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.037
Get your hands off
of my child.

40:57.122 --> 40:58.497
Athena.

40:58.581 --> 40:59.623
Stay back!

41:01.709 --> 41:03.252
Stay away.

41:03.336 --> 41:04.419
Stand down!

41:21.771 --> 41:24.189
Plug it in.
I need to talk to it.

41:27.735 --> 41:28.777
Let God's will be done.

41:28.862 --> 41:30.112
Shut up.

41:30.905 --> 41:33.115
It's time to get
some answers.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.374
Tyrol, will you come in
here and take Hera, please?

41:43.168 --> 41:44.835
Just do it, Tyrol.

41:53.052 --> 41:54.052
Come on.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.938
Is she gone?
Yeah.

42:23.833 --> 42:26.293
You are never
gonna take my child.

42:26.878 --> 42:28.795
We didn't come here to.

42:43.061 --> 42:44.186
Jump!

42:48.483 --> 42:52.361
GAETA: (SINGING)
To have her please

42:52.445 --> 42:56.073
Just one day wake

42:57.242 --> 43:01.662
To have her please

43:01.996 --> 43:08.335
Just one day wake

43:16.844 --> 43:18.595
