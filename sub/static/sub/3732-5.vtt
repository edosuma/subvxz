00:15.217 --> 00:16.886
[Pat] Our cousin Annie needs help.

00:16.969 --> 00:18.513
- [groaning]
- [Wiley] What happened?

00:19.471 --> 00:22.099
[Pat] She cut her leg
and it went from bad to worse.

00:22.183 --> 00:24.018
Without antibiotics, she'll die.

00:25.269 --> 00:26.604
Why do you need me?

00:27.647 --> 00:28.731
[Pat] At this point,

00:28.815 --> 00:31.275
any Creeker who tries
to show his or her face in town

00:31.358 --> 00:33.736
is risking getting shot at.

00:33.820 --> 00:35.780
You're one of them.

00:36.488 --> 00:38.199
Okay.

00:38.282 --> 00:41.536
Try to get Rifampin.
If you can't, I wrote down others.

00:42.954 --> 00:46.248
- I can take him now.
- We don't think that's the best idea.

00:46.332 --> 00:48.542
You trying to go in and out of town
with the baby.

00:48.626 --> 00:50.211
You know...

00:53.047 --> 00:56.383
- You're not asking, are you?
- With what Ronnie tried to do to you,

00:56.467 --> 00:58.469
you have more reason
to leave and never come back.

00:58.553 --> 01:01.222
So Jason is the insurance policy.

01:01.305 --> 01:03.057
You're holding my baby hostage.

01:03.140 --> 01:05.516
We're sorry.

01:05.602 --> 01:07.979
[Wiley] I thought you two were different.

02:31.062 --> 02:32.647
I heard you came looking for me.

02:33.439 --> 02:34.774
Sort of.

02:36.108 --> 02:37.359
How's the baby?

02:39.236 --> 02:40.571
Jason's fine.

02:41.613 --> 02:43.074
You named him?

02:43.157 --> 02:44.659
Yeah.

02:46.327 --> 02:48.204
It was time to step up my mothering game.

02:49.413 --> 02:52.124
Hey, I'm sorry.

02:54.001 --> 02:55.294
Me, too.

02:57.839 --> 02:58.965
Okay.

03:01.175 --> 03:03.052
So, I have something
I need to do right now,

03:03.135 --> 03:06.723
but maybe later,
if you're not too busy...

03:07.598 --> 03:08.850
Definitely.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.602
I'll come by your place.

03:11.685 --> 03:13.896
I don't think I can handle
too much more of Saint Melissa.

03:15.397 --> 03:17.149
Stay as long as you like.

03:20.236 --> 03:21.612
See you around.

03:22.739 --> 03:24.323
Sure, square.

04:12.663 --> 04:13.956
Room 14.

04:14.999 --> 04:16.375
C Block.

04:30.556 --> 04:31.974
You getting any texts?

04:32.058 --> 04:34.101
No, nothing.

04:34.185 --> 04:36.353
How do we have power
but the phones still don't work?

04:36.437 --> 04:39.106
I don't know. I don't think
the power going out was an accident.

04:39.190 --> 04:41.984
Not if they can turn it back on
and keep cell service off.

04:42.068 --> 04:45.154
Yeah, you... [grunting]
you might be onto something.

04:45.237 --> 04:46.906
You okay?

04:47.824 --> 04:49.325
Vince, what's wrong?

04:50.409 --> 04:52.286
- Vince.
- [retching]

04:54.121 --> 04:57.291
- You seemed so mysterious back in school.
- [chuckles]

04:57.374 --> 04:59.668
- Yeah?
- No, it's true.

04:59.751 --> 05:02.088
Don't take it the wrong way.

05:02.171 --> 05:04.882
It's just that
the whole Mennonite thing...

05:04.966 --> 05:07.176
it just made all of you
seem like foreigners.

05:07.259 --> 05:08.302
What?

05:08.385 --> 05:11.973
I know. I'm sorry that sounded
kind of prejudiced, but...

05:12.056 --> 05:13.474
it's just that you all stayed

05:13.557 --> 05:16.393
so close together
and no one saw you outside of school.

05:16.477 --> 05:19.230
Didn't you ever feel,
I don't know, different?

05:21.607 --> 05:23.400
Not at first, no.

05:24.485 --> 05:26.278
Then... sure.

05:27.529 --> 05:30.032
I wondered what it would be like
to ride in a car...

05:31.075 --> 05:34.286
wear clothes bought from the Gap,
eat McDonald's,

05:34.370 --> 05:36.622
go to regular high school.

05:38.207 --> 05:40.960
So... what's your plan?

05:41.043 --> 05:43.337
Do you need a ride back to your...

05:43.420 --> 05:46.173
- Community?
- Right, yeah.

05:47.258 --> 05:48.675
No.

05:51.137 --> 05:54.473
I guess I'm not getting more
of an explanation than that, am I?

05:57.351 --> 06:00.396
Well, if you want...

06:00.479 --> 06:01.855
you can stay here.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.484
[Franny] Gord?

06:06.193 --> 06:07.736
We have a problem.

06:09.947 --> 06:11.198
[sighs]

06:12.199 --> 06:13.575
[cows mooing]

06:20.124 --> 06:23.377
Well, obviously,
the antibiotics aren't working.

06:23.460 --> 06:26.005
Every last one of them now has mastitis.

06:26.088 --> 06:27.214
How bad is it, Gord?

06:28.132 --> 06:30.467
If we can't get this under control,

06:30.551 --> 06:33.679
we lose our only source of milk
inside the fence.

06:34.513 --> 06:38.059
When we had problems with the animals,
my father used a liniment oil.

06:38.142 --> 06:39.185
Worked wonders.

06:39.268 --> 06:41.103
Even for something like this?

06:41.187 --> 06:43.147
Pretty much for everything.

06:44.023 --> 06:45.983
- Worth a try.
- [car horn honking]

06:46.067 --> 06:48.027
Who's that?

06:54.450 --> 06:57.161
Gord, we, uh...
we need your help.

06:57.244 --> 07:00.414
[sighs] I'm dealing with
a few things here.

07:00.497 --> 07:02.916
It's Vince.
He's in pretty bad shape.

07:05.127 --> 07:06.837
I can drive you to your farm.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.840
- You can drive?
- Yeah, ever since the quarantine.

07:09.924 --> 07:11.425
[Gord] That would help.

07:12.343 --> 07:13.552
Okay.

07:23.687 --> 07:25.189
[groaning]

07:33.572 --> 07:35.324
[breathing heavily]

07:39.245 --> 07:40.246
[Tracey] Ronnie?

07:41.413 --> 07:42.456
Ronnie?

07:42.539 --> 07:45.167
- What are you doing? Stop.
- Get out of here. I need that!

07:46.293 --> 07:47.378
No.

07:48.420 --> 07:50.589
Maybe some pain will do you some good.

07:50.672 --> 07:53.592
- Remind you what you tried to do to Wiley.
- [exhales deeply]

07:53.675 --> 07:55.970
If Mom and Dad could see you now.

07:56.053 --> 07:59.681
Well, I guess it's a good thing
that they're dead.

08:02.518 --> 08:04.353
[whimpers] What's wrong with you?

08:04.436 --> 08:07.439
What's wrong with you, Ronnie?

08:07.523 --> 08:09.858
When did you become a monster?

08:25.374 --> 08:27.876
[shuddering]

08:30.421 --> 08:32.381
[Chuck]
You don't think it's the virus?

08:32.464 --> 08:35.801
- I hear Ms. Symonds, she--
- Yeah, I know.

08:35.884 --> 08:37.135
I thought the government
was just being paranoid.

08:37.219 --> 08:38.761
I thought we were done
with all this virus shit.

08:38.845 --> 08:40.431
Apparently not.

08:41.765 --> 08:43.850
But Vince doesn't have it.

08:43.933 --> 08:45.394
If he did,
he'd be dead already.

08:48.064 --> 08:50.482
Hey, Vin.
How you doing, buddy?

08:50.566 --> 08:52.276
I feel like I'm dying.
[groans]

08:53.569 --> 08:54.861
Tell me where it hurts, okay?

08:54.945 --> 08:57.281
Everywhere.
My stomach.

08:59.408 --> 09:03.162
If you can't help me,
then shoot me.

09:04.830 --> 09:06.040
[Vince groaning]

09:06.123 --> 09:07.333
Sorry.

09:08.292 --> 09:10.669
- Sorry. Just breathe, breathe.
- [vomiting]

09:13.589 --> 09:15.632
[Vince breathing heavily]

09:18.009 --> 09:19.010
Hey.

09:20.637 --> 09:22.098
Hey, buddy.

09:22.181 --> 09:25.684
It's his appendix.
My guess, it's burst.

09:25.767 --> 09:26.768
How do you know?

09:26.852 --> 09:28.604
Mine ruptured two years ago.

09:30.314 --> 09:31.857
It's gonna kill him, isn't it?

09:31.940 --> 09:34.860
There's nothing we can do.
Not without a hospital.

09:36.653 --> 09:38.489
Okay, a hospital.

09:38.572 --> 09:40.824
- What?
- We get him to a hospital.

09:40.907 --> 09:43.535
- Oh, gee, why didn't I think of that?
- I'm serious, Gord.

09:43.619 --> 09:47.206
We load him up in Ted Metz's plane
and I fly him over the fence myself.

09:47.289 --> 09:48.582
Chuck, that's way too dangerous.

09:48.665 --> 09:50.251
It can't be that hard.

09:50.334 --> 09:52.002
It's suicide.

09:53.087 --> 09:54.171
[Kevin] I know how to fly.

09:56.047 --> 09:59.343
My grandfather, he, uh...
he gave me a few lessons.

09:59.426 --> 10:01.428
I'll take him.

10:02.388 --> 10:04.014
Are you sure?

10:04.806 --> 10:06.267
Yeah.

10:26.245 --> 10:28.414
No shit.

10:30.124 --> 10:31.458
[alarm beeping]

10:45.431 --> 10:46.640
[typing]

10:47.308 --> 10:48.684
[computer chimes]

10:51.853 --> 10:53.189
[beeping]

11:02.698 --> 11:04.700
[beeping]

11:10.414 --> 11:12.708
[door closes and locks]

11:15.294 --> 11:16.670
[exhales sharply]

11:24.220 --> 11:25.221
Come on.

11:25.304 --> 11:26.930
Shit!

11:33.229 --> 11:35.522
[Gord] We'll get you out of here soon.
[Chuck] You'll be okay, man.

11:35.606 --> 11:36.815
[Gord] Okay.
[Chuck] Okay.

11:39.860 --> 11:41.487
What the hell are you doing here?

11:41.570 --> 11:44.698
What happened?
Please tell me it's not the virus again.

11:44.781 --> 11:46.242
No. No, we think his appendix burst.

11:46.325 --> 11:48.327
Where you been?
Your sister's worried.

11:49.495 --> 11:51.288
Around. Taking a break from things.

11:51.372 --> 11:54.583
Oh, yeah? Rumor has it
you're staying out at the Creekers'.

11:55.459 --> 11:56.668
Yeah, sort of, I guess.

11:56.752 --> 11:58.420
Seriously, Wiley?

11:58.504 --> 12:01.047
It's only temporary. I'm leaving
as soon as I get them some medicine.

12:01.131 --> 12:02.716
Excuse me?

12:02.799 --> 12:05.135
Ever since you shot at Pat,
they don't exactly feel welcome in town.

12:05.218 --> 12:07.053
So they sent me.
I just need some antibiotics.

12:07.137 --> 12:08.680
Yeah, not from here.

12:08.764 --> 12:11.141
Come on. There's a little girl
with a leg so swollen, she might die.

12:11.224 --> 12:13.143
Oh, yeah?
And Ronnie has come in here

12:13.226 --> 12:15.396
and pretty much helped himself
to whatever he pleased.

12:15.479 --> 12:17.481
The Creekers aren't getting another thing.

12:17.564 --> 12:20.317
- You don't know it was Ronnie.
- [Gord] It's true, Wiley.

12:20.401 --> 12:25.030
The other day, when I caught him stealing,
his bag was full of pills.

12:25.113 --> 12:26.239
[scoffs]

12:27.157 --> 12:30.076
- Well, I swear this is not for him.
- [Chuck] Vince needs Oxy.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.746
Oxy that Ronnie is pretty much baked on.

12:32.829 --> 12:34.998
So you tell him to come here
and return what he stole,

12:35.081 --> 12:37.501
and then maybe we'll discuss it.

12:37.584 --> 12:39.169
[sighs]

12:40.170 --> 12:41.880
All right. Come on.

12:44.341 --> 12:46.343
[Amanda] Come and get it, Jack!

12:51.557 --> 12:52.891
Jack?

12:54.560 --> 12:55.561
[sighs]

12:57.646 --> 12:58.772
Jack!

12:59.690 --> 13:01.442
Come on, boy!

13:01.525 --> 13:02.693
Jack!

13:03.652 --> 13:05.278
Jack!

13:07.656 --> 13:09.533
Jack!

13:13.036 --> 13:17.333
Chuck, I know how you feel.
He's like a... a brother to you.

13:17.416 --> 13:21.337
But even with the remote possibility
that Kevin can fly the plane,

13:21.420 --> 13:23.004
which I seriously doubt,

13:23.088 --> 13:25.215
who's to say that
they won't get shot out of the sky?

13:25.298 --> 13:28.051
Come on, what sort of conspiracy theories
are you smoking, Gord?

13:29.260 --> 13:30.554
Besides, you have a better idea?

13:30.637 --> 13:32.764
Let Vince die?
You know how much pain he's in.

13:32.848 --> 13:35.016
So what? We're just gonna stand there
and watch him suffer?

13:35.100 --> 13:36.309
It's a death wish.

13:36.393 --> 13:38.269
No, it is actually doing something.

13:38.354 --> 13:39.730
What is your solution?

13:39.813 --> 13:41.607
[sighs]

13:43.024 --> 13:44.818
Thought so.

13:44.901 --> 13:46.111
Go back to your farm, Gord.

13:46.194 --> 13:48.196
It was a mistake
sending for you in the first place.

13:54.870 --> 13:56.329
[Jason crying]

14:30.572 --> 14:32.658
- [continues crying]
- No, it's okay.

14:32.741 --> 14:35.411
Oh, baby. It's okay.

14:35.494 --> 14:36.495
[shushes]

14:37.454 --> 14:38.622
It's all right.

14:38.705 --> 14:40.374
[Ronnie] Shit.

14:41.332 --> 14:43.919
There you go.
It's okay, baby.

14:44.002 --> 14:46.087
- Oh, there's a smile.
- [door closes]

14:47.130 --> 14:48.424
Ronnie?

14:49.340 --> 14:51.885
It's okay.
[shushes] It's okay.

14:57.098 --> 14:58.349
Do you need any help?

14:59.267 --> 15:02.228
No, I'm fine.
You should've stayed in the truck.

15:02.312 --> 15:04.022
- I thought something happened to you.
- [horse snorts]

15:04.105 --> 15:06.775
- You said you'd be right back.
- Okay.

15:06.858 --> 15:08.234
- What's going on?
- [shushes] Get down.

15:08.318 --> 15:10.529
[man] Morning, John!

15:14.074 --> 15:15.200
I got it.

15:15.283 --> 15:17.786
What happens if they catch us stealing?

15:17.869 --> 15:20.497
We're not stealing.
This is mine.

15:21.164 --> 15:23.417
Okay, he's clear. Let's go.

15:24.668 --> 15:27.045
[Melissa] The Creekers?

15:27.128 --> 15:30.424
I could go down there again, talk to her.
Maybe she'll come back.

15:30.507 --> 15:31.717
No.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.803
Either she'll get it or she won't.

15:34.886 --> 15:36.597
I should've just kept my mouth shut.

15:37.848 --> 15:40.183
I miss the baby.
None of this is working.

15:40.266 --> 15:42.894
- Hey, Mel. Easy.
- [sighs]

15:42.978 --> 15:44.312
You're one of the good ones.

15:46.565 --> 15:48.484
You really think so?

15:48.567 --> 15:49.901
Definitely.

15:49.985 --> 15:53.489
Just look at all the things
you're doing with the kids.

15:59.620 --> 16:01.246
I should go.

16:03.373 --> 16:05.000
[sighs] You sure?

16:09.337 --> 16:10.964
Yeah.

16:23.769 --> 16:25.812
[sobbing]

16:46.374 --> 16:47.751
[toilet flushing]

16:49.002 --> 16:51.004
[knocks on door]
You okay in there?

16:54.550 --> 16:55.884
I need help.

16:56.677 --> 16:57.886
[gasps]

16:57.969 --> 16:59.596
Please.

17:05.685 --> 17:07.771
Hey! That's my dog!

17:07.854 --> 17:09.021
[dog whines]

17:09.105 --> 17:13.068
- It's okay. Here.
- Why do you have my dog?

17:13.151 --> 17:15.612
You know he's my dog, right?

17:15.695 --> 17:17.864
My address is on the tag.

17:17.948 --> 17:23.662
And it also says that his name is Jack
and I live at the same address.

17:23.744 --> 17:26.372
- So that proves it.
- Yeah, it certainly does.

17:26.455 --> 17:30.544
I was actually just heading to the address
to see if anybody still lived there.

17:30.627 --> 17:33.504
I'm happy I found you 'cause I was worried
he was a stray or something.

17:33.589 --> 17:36.758
No! No!
He's definitely not a stray.

17:36.842 --> 17:37.884
Come on, Jack.

17:37.968 --> 17:39.302
- Jack escaped.
- Really?

17:39.385 --> 17:43.473
He's not allowed to roam free,
or else he'll be killed.

17:43.557 --> 17:45.976
I am supposed to be very careful.

17:46.059 --> 17:48.604
- Mmm-hmm.
- But sometimes I'm not so careful.

17:48.687 --> 17:51.648
Like this morning,
I left the front door open.

17:51.732 --> 17:53.609
You won't tell Chuck,
will you?

17:54.484 --> 17:56.111
Chuck?

17:56.194 --> 17:57.487
Chuck's my brother.

17:57.571 --> 18:01.908
He says he's my father and mother, too,
because they died.

18:01.992 --> 18:05.203
He makes me hamburgers whenever I want.
I can't make them anymore.

18:05.286 --> 18:08.081
Do you have a brother?

18:08.164 --> 18:09.457
Yeah, I do.

18:09.540 --> 18:11.668
- What's his name?
- Harrison.

18:11.752 --> 18:14.129
Was that the same Harrison
who stole the car?

18:14.212 --> 18:15.839
[chuckles] Yeah.

18:15.922 --> 18:17.548
I remember you.

18:17.633 --> 18:19.509
Chuck says that was wrong.

18:19.593 --> 18:23.680
Very wrong.
But he was more wrong to Harrison.

18:23.764 --> 18:25.766
- Chuck said that?
- Yup.

18:25.849 --> 18:27.058
Time to feed Jack.

18:27.142 --> 18:28.644
Bye!

18:33.815 --> 18:34.816
[sighs]

18:35.734 --> 18:37.152
[moaning]

18:41.489 --> 18:43.116
[whimpering]

18:52.959 --> 18:54.753
[Pat] I'll give Ronnie credit.

18:54.836 --> 18:56.379
Even when he's trying to
do the right thing,

18:56.462 --> 18:58.006
he manages to screw it all up.

18:58.089 --> 19:00.341
You can't pin all this on him.

19:00.425 --> 19:02.343
For one, he's an addict.

19:02.427 --> 19:04.971
Secondly, I watched him do it.

19:05.055 --> 19:07.307
It never occurred to me that
flushing the pills would be a problem.

19:07.390 --> 19:11.853
Or that Chuck would tell Wiley,
"No Oxy, no meds for Annie."

19:18.401 --> 19:19.402
How's Annie?

19:20.486 --> 19:22.113
Her fever's getting higher.

19:22.197 --> 19:25.200
Wiley and I will go back
into town tonight.

19:27.869 --> 19:31.790
Why not just sneak into town by yourself,
get the drugs?

19:31.873 --> 19:34.542
Forget about Wiley altogether.
You don't need her.

19:34.625 --> 19:37.462
Look, she's our insurance policy
in case things go sideways.

19:38.714 --> 19:42.383
Rumor has it,
Chuck has half the hockey team armed.

19:42.467 --> 19:43.802
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

19:45.053 --> 19:46.637
I doubt it'll come to that.

19:46.722 --> 19:48.348
If it does?

19:50.141 --> 19:52.769
If I get caught, you think anyone's
gonna bother asking questions first?

19:56.106 --> 19:59.400
At least Wiley'll buy me
some negotiating power.

19:59.484 --> 20:01.027
[sighing]

20:16.584 --> 20:20.130
You okay, Kev?
You sure about this?

20:20.213 --> 20:23.508
Yeah. Yeah, I just, uh...
Just give me a second.

20:24.801 --> 20:26.762
You don't have to do this, you know.

20:28.388 --> 20:30.640
I'm fine, Chuck.
This'll work.

20:30.724 --> 20:31.725
Yeah.

20:31.808 --> 20:34.770
When you make it across...

20:34.853 --> 20:36.980
remind the world about us.

20:44.445 --> 20:49.034
[sighs] Okay, Vince... here we go.

20:49.117 --> 20:50.493
Just hang in there, buddy.

20:50.576 --> 20:52.703
[plane engine starting]

21:17.813 --> 21:19.397
[Jason whining]

21:21.232 --> 21:22.567
[shushing]

21:32.160 --> 21:33.161
Going somewhere?

21:33.244 --> 21:35.121
[breathing heavily]

22:13.743 --> 22:14.828
You scared me.

22:15.411 --> 22:17.080
You still didn't answer the question.

22:18.289 --> 22:19.958
I... I just wanted to get some fresh air.

22:20.791 --> 22:22.168
It doesn't look like that to me.

22:23.879 --> 22:26.172
Please, let me go.

22:31.887 --> 22:34.472
Here, take these.

22:37.267 --> 22:39.810
Annie still needs the drugs
whether you stay or you go.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.408
[Chuck] They can't do that.

22:54.784 --> 22:57.913
Just shoot the plane down.
It wasn't even close to the border.

22:57.996 --> 22:59.998
[Gord] I warned you this would happen!

23:03.084 --> 23:06.212
- Not now, Gord.
- So when, Chuck?

23:06.296 --> 23:09.257
Yesterday, you almost killed a guy
by stringing him up.

23:09.340 --> 23:11.176
And today...

23:11.259 --> 23:13.553
These deaths are on your head.

23:13.636 --> 23:14.762
You go to hell!

23:16.014 --> 23:17.807
At least I make decisions around here

23:17.890 --> 23:20.310
instead of hiding at my farm
at the first sign of trouble.

23:20.393 --> 23:23.354
Right. That's why
I got shot at the Creekers', huh?

23:23.438 --> 23:26.774
Just because you show up once
doesn't mean you're all in, Gord.

23:26.857 --> 23:30.736
I am trying to make it work...

23:30.820 --> 23:32.197
and you're just tearing it down!

23:34.157 --> 23:37.994
Maybe it's time for someone else to make
the tough decisions around here.

23:38.078 --> 23:40.330
Not just the rich kid.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.168
Well, it's not gonna be the pig farmer.

23:45.835 --> 23:48.088
They're cows, junior.

23:48.171 --> 23:50.506
Same pile of shit.

23:50.590 --> 23:52.175
Time to leave, Chuck.

23:54.094 --> 23:55.428
Go back to the mansion.

23:56.137 --> 23:57.680
Make me.

23:57.763 --> 23:58.764
[grunts]

24:02.810 --> 24:04.479
[both grunting]

24:12.653 --> 24:14.739
[both panting]

24:21.329 --> 24:22.747
Go home, Gord.

24:29.462 --> 24:30.838
[groaning]

24:36.511 --> 24:37.512
[sighs]

24:43.309 --> 24:44.394
[brakes squealing]

24:45.311 --> 24:46.646
Damn it.

24:48.231 --> 24:49.482
Damn it.

24:51.067 --> 24:53.069
[groans] Damn it!

24:53.903 --> 24:55.113
[engine revving]

25:00.743 --> 25:02.828
- Where's the car?
- [inhales sharply]

25:02.912 --> 25:04.205
Wiley took it.

25:05.456 --> 25:07.042
What? Why didn't you stop her?

25:08.918 --> 25:11.337
- [car approaching]
- Because I knew she'd come back.

25:12.338 --> 25:14.882
She was never gonna let
a little girl suffer.

25:18.803 --> 25:21.264
[Pat sighs]

25:44.287 --> 25:46.331
Frances said you were in here.

25:49.125 --> 25:50.168
That bad, huh?

25:50.918 --> 25:52.170
How's the other guy?

25:52.837 --> 25:54.046
Better than me.

25:54.922 --> 25:58.468
I, uh... was never much of a fighter.

26:06.976 --> 26:08.311
How did your parents die?

26:10.688 --> 26:13.858
Just like everybody else's, I suppose.

26:13.941 --> 26:15.985
It was quick.

26:17.778 --> 26:20.281
My father couldn't wait for that.

26:20.365 --> 26:21.782
He hung himself.

26:23.784 --> 26:27.247
Didn't leave a note.
Didn't say goodbye.

26:32.543 --> 26:33.878
Sit down.

26:35.171 --> 26:36.422
[groans]

27:11.081 --> 27:13.376
[Mark] You're the one
that runs the orphanage, right?

27:13.459 --> 27:15.420
Uh, yeah. Kids are down for the night.

27:16.421 --> 27:19.715
- Can I get a beer?
- You don't seem like the drinking type.

27:20.383 --> 27:21.967
It's been a long couple of weeks.

27:25.305 --> 27:27.014
Sure. It's on the house.

27:28.891 --> 27:29.892
[sighs]

27:29.975 --> 27:32.853
Hey, Chuck.
You want to play Crazy Eights?

27:32.937 --> 27:34.772
Amanda, not now.

27:34.855 --> 27:36.274
Okay. When?

27:36.357 --> 27:38.067
Later.

27:38.150 --> 27:39.777
- What time later?
- I don't know. I don't know.

27:39.860 --> 27:41.404
Later, okay?

27:41.487 --> 27:43.614
9:25 later?

27:43.698 --> 27:45.074
Sure.

27:45.157 --> 27:49.370
If that doesn't work,
9:30 or 9:45?

27:49.454 --> 27:50.871
Yeah, sure, whatever.

27:50.955 --> 27:53.208
Well? Which one?

27:53.291 --> 27:57.878
Amanda, honestly, it doesn't matter, okay?
I don't care.

27:57.962 --> 28:03.133
Chuck! It's important to care of a time.
Well, which one?

28:03.218 --> 28:05.135
Amanda, stop being a baby!

28:05.220 --> 28:06.971
You stop being a baby, too!

28:12.685 --> 28:13.894
[door slams]

28:22.778 --> 28:24.113
[cocks gun]

28:26.198 --> 28:27.242
Please, don't shoot!

28:27.325 --> 28:28.868
What are you doing here?

28:28.951 --> 28:30.286
Nothing.

28:30.370 --> 28:32.455
This is the last place you should be.

28:33.456 --> 28:35.082
Okay, then I'll just leave.

28:35.165 --> 28:36.667
You're not going anywhere, Adam.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.086
Open the knapsack.

28:39.169 --> 28:41.171
Slowly.

28:41.256 --> 28:42.257
[metal squealing]

28:43.883 --> 28:45.218
[Ellen grunts]

28:49.305 --> 28:51.056
- Another?
- Uh, no.

28:51.140 --> 28:53.100
I gotta pick up some stuff
for the kids at the pharmacy.

28:53.183 --> 28:54.269
Oh, come on.
Have one more.

28:56.604 --> 28:59.064
- Nah, you should stay.
- Hey.

28:59.148 --> 29:02.693
Whoa, whoa. I didn't mean anything.
I'm sorry.

29:02.777 --> 29:05.946
I just...
I really enjoyed talking to you.

29:06.697 --> 29:08.699
You're different in a good way.

29:09.575 --> 29:11.952
Uh, yeah. Just--
I should go.

29:14.622 --> 29:15.915
[sighing]

29:27.927 --> 29:29.262
There's no antibiotics.

29:29.345 --> 29:31.306
Yeah, I don't see any either.

29:31.389 --> 29:34.183
You think they knew we were coming?

29:38.938 --> 29:39.939
Bingo.

29:41.316 --> 29:42.692
[Melissa] Wiley.

29:50.491 --> 29:52.159
Hey, we got what we came for.
Nothing else.

29:52.242 --> 29:53.453
It's stealing.

29:53.536 --> 29:55.788
A little girl's gonna die.
Does that not matter to you?

29:55.871 --> 29:59.459
Everyone knows Ronnie stole the drugs.
The Creekers don't need more.

29:59.542 --> 30:02.086
That was Ronnie,
not the rest of us.

30:03.170 --> 30:05.590
We're not asking.

30:07.216 --> 30:09.469
You can stay, Wiley.
You don't have to do this.

30:09.552 --> 30:13.055
Yes, I do. And not because I have to,
but because I should.

30:16.684 --> 30:18.478
[Jason wailing]

30:18.561 --> 30:21.063
[Tracey] <i>As if we don't have enough</i>
<i>trouble without you stirring up more?</i>

30:21.146 --> 30:22.815
[Pat] <i>Did you cut off her finger</i>
<i>and steal that ring?</i>

30:22.898 --> 30:25.275
[Gord] <i>Ronnie here thinks</i>
<i>he can steal from people.</i>

30:25.360 --> 30:27.194
<i>Come on, Ronnie,</i>
<i>people might need those drugs.</i>

30:27.277 --> 30:28.321
[Stacey]
<i>What I have with Chuck is great...</i>

30:28.404 --> 30:29.489
[Gord] <i>Take it easy, Ronnie.</i>
<i>Use your head.</i>

30:29.572 --> 30:32.282
[Chuck] <i>Never touch my sister again!</i>

30:32.367 --> 30:35.328
[Wiley] <i>The only way you could get a girl</i>
<i>is to rape her!</i>

30:35.411 --> 30:37.747
[Wiley] <i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>
[Ronnie] <i>You're not better than me!</i>

30:39.206 --> 30:41.000
[Jason continues wailing]

30:45.045 --> 30:47.172
Shut up. Shut up!

30:47.256 --> 30:48.466
[breathing heavily]

30:58.684 --> 30:59.977
Shut up!

31:00.060 --> 31:01.311
[grunts]

31:04.815 --> 31:06.150
Shut up!

31:10.571 --> 31:12.573
- [leaves rustling]
- [barking]

31:12.657 --> 31:13.658
Jack!

31:24.419 --> 31:25.420
[gunshot]

31:29.173 --> 31:31.551
You think Melissa's gonna tell anyone?

31:32.510 --> 31:33.928
Uh, I don't know.

31:35.388 --> 31:37.723
- No.
- Yeah, I hope not.

31:37.807 --> 31:40.726
It'll just stir the pot more.

31:41.686 --> 31:44.354
- Jack!
- [barking]

31:44.439 --> 31:46.982
Ronnie's such an idiot.
None of this would've happened

31:47.066 --> 31:48.233
- if it wasn't for--
- Watch out!

31:48.317 --> 31:49.610
[brakes screeching]

31:51.487 --> 31:53.238
[panting]

32:00.871 --> 32:02.915
Amanda! Ugh!

32:03.833 --> 32:05.543
Help! [exhales sharply]

32:05.626 --> 32:06.711
Help me!

32:06.794 --> 32:08.463
She just ran into the road.
I didn't see her.

32:08.546 --> 32:09.797
Yeah, I know,
I know, I know.

32:09.880 --> 32:12.007
Where'd she come from?
She didn't see the car?

32:12.091 --> 32:13.593
I don't know!
Amanda, come on!

32:13.676 --> 32:14.760
Amanda!

32:16.554 --> 32:18.681
[Gord]
<i>So, I think we stay here from now on.</i>

32:19.724 --> 32:21.058
Take care of the farm.

32:21.141 --> 32:22.852
Stay out of town.

32:24.144 --> 32:25.646
That sounds like a good idea.

32:26.981 --> 32:29.859
- What about milk deliveries?
- They can come to us.

32:29.942 --> 32:33.278
- But, Gord--
- I'm done, Franny.

32:33.362 --> 32:35.615
There's no talking any sense into Chuck.

32:35.698 --> 32:37.074
And the Creekers? They--

32:38.117 --> 32:41.370
Look, if they wanna kill each other, fine.

32:42.580 --> 32:45.875
But I don't want any of us hurt
because of it.

32:47.585 --> 32:50.170
We have more than enough supplies to last.

32:52.465 --> 32:53.466
Let's eat.

32:55.968 --> 32:57.219
[Wiley panting]

33:03.267 --> 33:04.268
She's dead.

33:07.437 --> 33:09.398
What are we gonna do?

33:10.900 --> 33:12.693
We have to leave.

33:14.737 --> 33:18.323
No... No, we have to stay.
We have to tell them the truth.

33:18.407 --> 33:20.951
Chuck's already shot at me once.
We just killed his sister, all right?

33:21.035 --> 33:22.369
He's not gonna wait around to talk.

33:22.452 --> 33:24.454
Well, I'll talk to him, okay?
He'll listen to me!

33:24.539 --> 33:25.540
No, he won't.

33:26.290 --> 33:28.333
All right, someone's
bound to come any minute.

33:28.417 --> 33:31.045
There's nothing
we can do for her right now.

33:31.128 --> 33:33.673
And trust me, if they find us here,
we're dead.

33:34.632 --> 33:36.258
[groans] Damn it!

33:36.341 --> 33:37.968
Come on.

33:40.345 --> 33:41.806
I'm sorry.

34:03.578 --> 34:05.037
[doorbell rings]

34:14.295 --> 34:15.297
Hi.

34:15.380 --> 34:17.091
Hi.

34:17.800 --> 34:19.217
Are you okay?

34:19.301 --> 34:21.846
Yeah, yeah.
[chuckles]

34:24.098 --> 34:26.391
You know, you're the last person
I expected to see.

34:26.475 --> 34:27.851
Yeah...

34:29.103 --> 34:32.982
I... [sighs]
I wanted to explain to you that...

34:33.065 --> 34:36.400
when I finally got Harrison
to tell me exactly what happened,

34:36.485 --> 34:40.781
I figured out that things weren't quite
as black and white as they seemed.

34:40.864 --> 34:44.159
And I can tell that things
went downhill pretty quickly.

34:44.243 --> 34:46.120
[inhales sharply]

34:46.203 --> 34:48.581
[stutters] I don't know. I...

34:48.664 --> 34:53.835
I guess what I'm trying to say is
that it wasn't entirely your fault and--

34:53.918 --> 34:56.213
No, no, no. It...

34:56.295 --> 34:59.216
I was an idiot.
I mean, you don't do that to a kid.

35:00.843 --> 35:01.927
But I'm...

35:03.012 --> 35:06.891
I'm sorry, I...
It wasn't right.

35:08.392 --> 35:09.393
[chuckles softly]

35:10.060 --> 35:11.145
What?

35:12.187 --> 35:14.439
You passed the test.

35:15.357 --> 35:17.401
- Test?
- Yeah.

35:17.484 --> 35:21.488
My mom always used to say that
if a guy could admit that he was wrong,

35:21.571 --> 35:24.408
then... there's hope for him.

35:24.491 --> 35:25.993
Or something.

35:29.329 --> 35:30.455
Wanna come in?

35:33.208 --> 35:35.502
Yeah. Yeah, I...
Okay.

35:35.585 --> 35:36.837
- [chuckles]
- Okay.

35:41.383 --> 35:42.551
[sighs]

35:47.181 --> 35:48.766
[Melissa gasps]

35:51.268 --> 35:52.269
[snickers]

35:53.228 --> 35:54.313
Wow.

35:55.439 --> 35:58.608
- Must've been nice, growing up rich.
- [snickers]

36:00.736 --> 36:03.613
I mean, not to sound
like a jerk or anything, but...

36:03.698 --> 36:05.658
I never really thought about it.

36:05.741 --> 36:09.662
It just... seemed normal,
you know?

36:10.663 --> 36:11.664
Hmm.

36:15.542 --> 36:16.543
[sighs]

36:21.548 --> 36:23.217
I don't want to do this anymore.

36:24.802 --> 36:25.970
What do you mean?

36:26.846 --> 36:28.806
It's obvious, isn't it?

36:30.349 --> 36:32.101
I'm not a leader.

36:34.478 --> 36:37.522
Everything I do, I screw up.

36:38.816 --> 36:40.776
I almost got your brother killed, and Pat.

36:40.860 --> 36:43.863
And if I had listened to Gord, then...

36:45.447 --> 36:47.074
Kevin would still be alive.

36:48.242 --> 36:50.660
You know, maybe even Vince.

36:50.745 --> 36:52.830
Everything's going to shit.

36:54.957 --> 36:58.085
And it's pretty clear
that I'm part of the problem.

36:59.503 --> 37:02.965
You know, I used to think
that just because my father...

37:03.048 --> 37:05.968
owned so much of this town that...

37:06.051 --> 37:07.762
that I should be
the one to take charge.

37:09.889 --> 37:11.473
And now...

37:13.183 --> 37:14.852
[panting]

37:14.935 --> 37:16.353
What is it?

37:17.855 --> 37:19.481
[voice trembling] It's Amanda.

37:29.366 --> 37:31.035
Hello.

37:32.745 --> 37:33.746
Can I help you?

37:34.371 --> 37:37.917
I apologize for the late hour,
but you have something that belongs to me.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.086
What are you talking about?
The liniment oil?

37:41.170 --> 37:43.964
I'm not here for the oil.

37:44.048 --> 37:46.508
I'm here for my wife...
Hanna.

37:50.637 --> 37:52.848
- [Jason wailing]
- [Tracey shushing]

37:52.932 --> 37:54.308
No, it's okay.

37:54.391 --> 37:55.434
[Ronnie breathing heavily]

37:55.517 --> 37:56.936
Shut that baby up!

37:57.727 --> 37:59.772
Ronnie, what are you doing?

37:59.855 --> 38:02.649
I can't take this!

38:05.027 --> 38:06.320
Shut it up!

38:07.279 --> 38:09.573
He's not gonna calm down
if you're yelling, okay?

38:09.656 --> 38:11.658
No, you're tricking me.
It's a trick.

38:11.741 --> 38:12.868
Shut it up!

38:13.994 --> 38:15.412
[voice trembling]
What's a trick, Ronnie?

38:15.495 --> 38:17.622
Ronnie, you have to trust me.

38:17.706 --> 38:19.458
No, you hit me with a shovel!

38:23.378 --> 38:25.840
I'm sorry, okay?

38:31.095 --> 38:33.388
[crying]
Don't apologize.

38:34.514 --> 38:38.602
What's wrong with me?
Why did I do it?

38:39.812 --> 38:41.105
Just give me the knife, okay?

38:41.188 --> 38:43.648
No. No.

38:43.732 --> 38:44.774
Ronnie, no.

38:44.859 --> 38:46.110
I've done such awful things.

38:46.193 --> 38:47.361
Ronnie, don't!

38:47.444 --> 38:51.448
You said yourself,
Mom and Dad would be ashamed of me.

38:52.074 --> 38:53.075
Right?

38:53.868 --> 38:55.160
[sobbing]

38:55.244 --> 38:56.245
I'm not.

38:56.328 --> 38:59.414
You're trying to make it right.

39:00.833 --> 39:02.251
That has to count for something.

39:09.008 --> 39:11.343
[sobbing]

39:11.426 --> 39:12.970
I'm sorry.

39:14.721 --> 39:16.181
It's okay.

39:19.434 --> 39:21.228
I'm sorry.

39:44.459 --> 39:46.211
Amanda, I'm so sorry.

40:01.101 --> 40:02.227
Adam.

40:04.271 --> 40:06.773
I just want to ask you a few questions.

40:32.424 --> 40:34.176
What do you know about Art Carey?

40:36.261 --> 40:38.638
I found a canister on his body.

40:39.431 --> 40:41.683
I think it might be
involved in the deaths.

40:43.018 --> 40:44.103
Whatever this is...

40:46.271 --> 40:49.024
I don't think it's natural.

40:49.108 --> 40:50.400
I think he made it.

40:53.362 --> 40:54.696
You're a smart kid.

40:55.614 --> 40:57.866
Did you tell anyone else about this?

40:57.950 --> 40:59.994
No.

41:00.077 --> 41:04.123
But if we do, it may point people
in the right direction for a cure.

41:04.206 --> 41:06.875
We can expose what Carey was doing.

41:06.959 --> 41:08.377
And why would I want to do that?

41:09.169 --> 41:10.170
[grunts]

41:10.754 --> 41:12.672
I'm on his side.

41:15.925 --> 41:17.469
Please.

41:17.552 --> 41:18.928
- [gunshot]
- [grunts]

41:19.013 --> 41:20.430
[shell clatters]

41:31.566 --> 41:33.443
Adam.

41:35.695 --> 41:37.406
Dad.
