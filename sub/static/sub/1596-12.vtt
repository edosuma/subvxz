19:24.581 --> 19:29.419
- [cries]
- IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.754
[sighs]

19:31.754 --> 19:35.550
MY SWEET KAREN.

19:35.550 --> 19:38.553
I KNEW
THIS DAY WOULD COME,

19:38.553 --> 19:42.557
WHEN I'D BE SAYING
A PROPER GOOD-BYE TO YOU.

19:42.557 --> 19:44.434
IT DIDN'T REALLY LOOK
LIKE THIS THOUGH.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.102
YOU DIDN'T--

19:46.102 --> 19:49.814
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A WHEELCHAIR AND--AND...

19:49.814 --> 19:54.068
A BIG...SCAR
ON YOUR HEAD.

20:04.078 --> 20:07.249
I KNOW I HAVE
TO LET YOU GO.

20:10.251 --> 20:13.129
- GOOD-BYE.

20:13.129 --> 20:15.340
- JUST STOP IT.
NO MORE GOOD-BYES.

20:15.340 --> 20:18.343
JUST SEE YOU SOON.

20:18.343 --> 20:20.720
- SEE YOU SOON.
- SEE YOU SOON!

20:20.720 --> 20:22.555
- SEE YOU SOON.
- SEE YOU SOON!

20:22.555 --> 20:25.267
- BABY.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.643
- WE'LL CALL YOU
WHEN WE GET SETTLED IN.

20:26.643 --> 20:30.647
- OKAY.
GO HEAL MY BABY.

20:30.647 --> 20:33.983
- I WILL.

20:37.446 --> 20:39.697
- [sniffles]
- BYE, BABY.

20:39.697 --> 20:40.782
[door closes]
BYE, BABY.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.492
[engine starting]

20:42.492 --> 20:46.704
BYE, HONEY!

20:46.704 --> 20:51.501
BYE!
BYE!

20:51.501 --> 20:54.504
LOVE YOU!

20:58.966 --> 21:01.219
WANT ME TO MAKE YOU
SOME MACARONI AND CHEESE?

21:01.219 --> 21:03.638
- UH, I HAVE TO FINISH
GETTING THE HOUSE READY

21:03.638 --> 21:05.264
FOR LIP'S PARTY.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.934
- LET ME GRAB MY COAT.
I CAN COME HELP.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.019
- SURE.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.774
- SO DON'T WORRY,
I'LL MAKE SURE

21:14.774 --> 21:16.360
THAT YOU HAVE EVERYTHING
YOU NEED.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.985
- DR. LISHMAN?

21:17.985 --> 21:20.988
- FIONA. HI.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.282
UH, I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU GUYS LATER.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.369
I'M SURPRISED TO SEE YOU.
ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?

21:26.369 --> 21:28.330
- YEAH,
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.540
- OH.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.797
HOW'S IAN?

21:37.797 --> 21:40.467
- FINE.

21:40.467 --> 21:45.263
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'D SEEN JIMMY LATELY?

21:45.263 --> 21:47.765
- HOW LONG?

21:47.765 --> 21:49.600
- ALMOST A WEEK.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.311
- YOU TWO
ARE HAVING PROBLEMS?

21:52.311 --> 21:55.606
- THINGS HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE ROUGH LATELY, YEAH.

21:55.606 --> 21:58.192
- ANY SIGN OF CONFLICT
OR THINGS NOT GOING HIS WAY,

21:58.192 --> 22:01.612
AND HE JUST...
DISAPPEARS.

22:01.612 --> 22:03.406
GONE.

22:03.406 --> 22:05.409
CHIPOTLE?
- WHAT?

22:05.409 --> 22:07.618
- I ALWAYS HAVE MY HOT DOG
WITH A LITTLE CHIPOTLE SAUCE.

22:07.618 --> 22:09.912
YOU WANT SOME?
- YEAH, SURE. THANKS.

22:09.912 --> 22:13.458
- ROSA, TWO SPECIALS.
CHIPOTLE.

22:13.458 --> 22:17.379
IT'S WHAT HE DOES.
I'VE GOTTEN USED TO IT.

22:17.379 --> 22:19.046
AT LEAST AS USED TO IT
AS A FATHER CAN WHEN HIS SON

22:19.046 --> 22:23.634
DOESN'T CALL OR EMAIL
FOR MONTHS AT A TIME.

22:23.634 --> 22:25.762
HERE YOU GO.
- THANK YOU.

22:25.762 --> 22:30.392
- MAYBE THIS TIME'S
DIFFERENT?

22:30.392 --> 22:32.018
- ABSOLUTELY.

22:32.018 --> 22:36.773
YEAH, YOU NEVER KNOW,
RIGHT?

22:36.773 --> 22:40.860
- I SHOULD GET BACK
TO WORK.

22:40.860 --> 22:44.781
- YOU'LL BE FINE.

22:44.781 --> 22:48.659
- THANKS FOR THE HOT DOG.

22:51.829 --> 22:56.542
- ALL RIGHT, THERE WE GO.
THERE'S THE LITTLE PEACH PIT.

22:56.542 --> 22:59.837
- HOLY CRAP,
THERE HE IS!

22:59.837 --> 23:01.506
- HE LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU,
BABY.

23:01.506 --> 23:03.299
- HE KIND OF DOES,
DOESN'T HE?

23:03.299 --> 23:04.967
- CAN YOU TELL
IF IT'S A BOY OR A GIRL, DOC?

23:04.967 --> 23:07.678
- 12 WEEKS IS TOO EARLY TO TELL.
GIVE IT ANOTHER MONTH.

23:07.678 --> 23:09.263
- 12 WEEKS?
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

23:09.263 --> 23:10.848
BUT WE ONLY STARTED TRYING
12 WEEKS AGO.

23:10.848 --> 23:12.475
- THEN IT MUST HAVE HAPPENED
ON THE FIRST GO-AROUND.

23:12.475 --> 23:15.561
LET ME PRINT THIS UP,
AND I'LL LET YOU GET DRESSED.

23:15.561 --> 23:18.272
- OOH, YEAH, THAT'S WEIRD.

23:18.272 --> 23:23.820
[chuckles] MY BODY USUALLY
TELLS ME WHEN I'M PREGNANT.

23:23.820 --> 23:28.282
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NEVER BEEN WRONG BEFORE.

23:28.282 --> 23:31.452
WONDER WHAT HAPPENED
THIS TIME.

23:35.873 --> 23:38.751
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- ROTC RETREAT.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.379
- SINCE WHEN?
- LAST MINUTE.

23:41.379 --> 23:44.632
HEY, WHERE'S MY KNIFE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

23:44.632 --> 23:48.761
- CARL, MY S.O.G. SEAL TEAM.
IT'S THE BEST FIXED BLADE I GOT.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.180
- [sighs]

23:51.180 --> 23:55.685
MY SAMURAI SWORD BROKE.
NEED A BACKUP TILL IT'S FIXED.

23:56.894 --> 23:58.729
- YEAH.

23:58.729 --> 24:00.690
- WHAT IF THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE
GOES DOWN WHILE YOU'RE GONE?

24:00.690 --> 24:05.487
WHO'S GONNA PROTECT
DEBBIE AND LIAM?

24:05.487 --> 24:07.656
- FINE, KEEP IT.
- REALLY?

24:07.656 --> 24:10.366
- YEAH, JUST PROMISE YOU'RE NOT
GONNA USE IT ON ANYTHING HUMAN.

24:10.366 --> 24:14.829
- CATS AREN'T HUMAN.
- ANYTHING LIVING. PROMISE.

24:14.829 --> 24:18.833
- PROMISE. CAN YOU TEACH ME
THE DIFFERENT HAND GRIPS?

24:18.833 --> 24:22.295
- SURE.
- THANKS.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.259
- HOLD ON, NOW.
- 12 WEEKS PREGNANT!

24:28.259 --> 24:30.678
- VERONICA, I PROMISE.
I SWEAR I HAD NO IDEA.

24:30.678 --> 24:32.138
- LADIES, PLEASE.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.681
HEY, V, COME ON,
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

24:33.681 --> 24:35.516
ALTHOUGH, HEY,
I SHOULD PROBABLY RECORD THIS

24:35.516 --> 24:37.644
IN CASE WE WANT
TO UPLOAD IT TO OUR SITE,

24:37.644 --> 24:39.562
MAKE SOME MONEY, JUST WATCH HER
BELLY IF YOU'RE GONNA HIT HER.

24:39.562 --> 24:40.938
- 12 WEEKS, KEV?

24:40.938 --> 24:42.440
- JUST TRYING TO KEEP
THE PEACE, BABY.

24:42.440 --> 24:43.441
- HONEY, I PROMISE,
I DIDN'T KNOW!

24:43.441 --> 24:44.568
- PLEASE, YOU ALWAYS KNOW.

24:44.568 --> 24:45.610
YOU'RE LIKE A WALKING PEE STICK!

24:45.610 --> 24:46.611
- YEAH, IN THE PAST,
BUT THIS TIME--

24:46.611 --> 24:48.655
- THERE IS NO "THIS TIME."

24:48.655 --> 24:50.532
YOU KEPT QUIET 'CAUSE YOU WANTED
TO KEEP FUCKING MY HUSBAND!

24:50.532 --> 24:52.576
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU LOOKING AT, HUH?

24:52.576 --> 24:54.035
MY HUSBAND FUCKED MY MOTHER
TO GET PREGNANT.

24:54.035 --> 24:56.454
SORRY WE CAN'T ALL HAVE OUR BABY
THE NORMAL WAY!

24:56.454 --> 24:57.788
- HEY, WHAT CAN I SAY?

24:57.788 --> 25:00.041
ONCE YOU GO WHITE,
YOU ALWAYS STAY TIGHT.

25:00.041 --> 25:03.587
HEY, I THINK
I JUST INSULTED MYSELF.

25:03.587 --> 25:06.923
- MOM, ADMIT IT.
- OKAY.

25:06.923 --> 25:08.633
OKAY, I THOUGHT
I MIGHT BE PREGNANT!

25:08.633 --> 25:09.634
- OH, MY GOD.
- NO, BUT, HONEY.

25:09.634 --> 25:10.885
LOOK, I DIDN'T KNOW.

25:10.885 --> 25:12.596
I DIDN'T TAKE
A TEST OR ANYTHING.

25:12.596 --> 25:14.597
I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW.
- WHAT? WHY?

25:14.597 --> 25:16.974
- BECAUSE I LIKED
WHAT WE HAD.

25:16.974 --> 25:18.726
- THANK YOU.
- EXCUSE ME?

25:18.726 --> 25:22.313
- NO, NOT WHAT WE,
ME AND KEV HAD, WHAT WE ALL HAD.

25:22.313 --> 25:24.566
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- BEEN FEELING SO LONELY LATELY.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.025
AND WHEN YOU CALLED ME
TO HELP OUT,

25:26.025 --> 25:27.569
IT MADE ME FEEL WANTED--

25:27.569 --> 25:31.030
WANTED IN A LOVING WAY,
IN A FAMILY WAY,

25:31.030 --> 25:35.660
NEEDED, IMPORTANT.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.036
- [high-pitched]
HEY, I'M YOUR BABY FETUS.

25:37.036 --> 25:40.206
PLEASE DON'T FIGHT ANYMORE.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.624
I KNOW KEV
IS A BIG, HOT STUD,

25:41.624 --> 25:45.461
AND YOU COULDN'T RESIST
HIS GIANT COCK PENIS.

25:45.461 --> 25:48.673
BUT I'M ALL THAT MATTERS NOW,
RIGHT?

25:55.805 --> 25:59.433
- [groans] WHAT DOES IT TAKE
TO GET A REFILL AROUND HERE?

25:59.433 --> 26:04.105
- JACKET AND TIE
WOULD PROBABLY HELP.

26:04.105 --> 26:06.983
- THIS IS NICE. WE DON'T
SPEND ENOUGH TIME TOGETHER.

26:06.983 --> 26:08.609
- NO, WE DON'T SPEND
ANY TIME TOGETHER.

26:08.609 --> 26:10.569
- EXACTLY MY POINT.

26:10.569 --> 26:15.617
YOU KNOW, SON,
YOU CAN ALWAYS COME TO ME.

26:15.617 --> 26:16.951
- THANKS, DAD.

26:16.951 --> 26:20.663
- I WORRY ABOUT YOU.
- IS THAT RIGHT?

26:20.663 --> 26:22.415
- A PARENT'S PLIGHT
NEVER GOES AWAY,

26:22.415 --> 26:25.209
NO MATTER HOW OLD
YOUR KID GETS.

26:25.209 --> 26:29.380
LOOK AT YOU,
18 NOW.

26:29.380 --> 26:32.967
A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE.

26:35.886 --> 26:37.596
WHERE THE FUCK
IS THAT WAITER?

26:37.596 --> 26:40.266
- DON'T GO GETTING
MISTY-EYED ON ME NOW.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.809
- [grunts]

26:41.809 --> 26:45.689
NEED ANY WORDS
OF FATHERLY ADVICE?

26:45.689 --> 26:47.606
- NO, I THINK I GOT IT COVERED.
- OH, COME ON, COME ON!

26:47.606 --> 26:52.486
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

26:52.486 --> 26:55.072
- OKAY, WHY NOT?
DAY COULDN'T GET ANY WEIRDER.

26:55.072 --> 26:59.703
UM, I'M DONE
WITH SCHOOL.

26:59.703 --> 27:01.704
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M GONNA DO

27:01.704 --> 27:05.624
TODAY OR TOMORROW

27:05.624 --> 27:07.752
OR FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE.

27:07.752 --> 27:10.212
- SO NO PLANS?

27:10.212 --> 27:12.840
- NO.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.844
- GOOD FOR YOU.
YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME.

27:15.844 --> 27:18.345
WE MARCH TO THE BEAT
OF A DIFFERENT DRUMMER.

27:18.345 --> 27:20.724
EVERYONE WILL TRY
TO CAGE YOU IN,

27:20.724 --> 27:22.224
TELL YOU YOU HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

27:22.224 --> 27:24.685
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR FUTURE SHOULD BE?

27:24.685 --> 27:27.688
THIS--
LIVING LIFE TO THE FULLEST,

27:27.688 --> 27:30.859
EVERY DAY
LIKE IT'S YOUR LAST.

27:30.859 --> 27:34.738
THIS PLACE IS SINGLE-HANDEDLY
LOWERING MY TOLERANCE.

27:34.738 --> 27:36.655
LET'S HIT
THE LIQUOR STORE.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.824
- HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
UM, YOU REALLY THINK

27:38.824 --> 27:41.077
THEY DESERVE YOUR HARD-EARNED
MONEY FOR THAT SERVICE?

27:41.077 --> 27:43.287
- DINE AND DASH?
- BITE AND BOLT.

27:43.287 --> 27:46.957
- EAT IT AND BEAT IT?
- I'LL TAKE THE FRONT DOOR.

27:49.502 --> 27:51.796
- EXCUSE ME, AMIGO,
UH, BANO?

27:51.796 --> 27:56.300
GRACIAS.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.762
- EXCUSE ME,
I GOTTA TAKE THIS CALL.

27:59.762 --> 28:03.307
CAN WE SEE A DESSERT MENU?
- OF COURSE.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.364
- HEY, FIONA,
MISSED YOU AT LUNCH.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.907
- WHAT ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE
DOING OUTSIDE MIKE'S OFFICE?

28:19.907 --> 28:22.368
- JOB APPLICANTS.
- THANKS SO MUCH, MAN, OKAY?

28:22.368 --> 28:23.702
WE'LL TALK TO YOU
LATER THIS WEEK.

28:23.702 --> 28:24.995
- YOU BET.

28:24.995 --> 28:26.748
- HI. UH, SORRY.
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

28:26.748 --> 28:28.792
- YEAH, UH, SURE.
[clears throat]

28:28.792 --> 28:30.209
- THERE'S A JOB OPENING UP?
- YEAH.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.419
RICK FROM SALES IS MOVING
TO OUR COLUMBUS OFFICE.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.713
- WELL, I WANT IT.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.382
- NO, I NEED SOMEBODY
WITH EXPERIENCE.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.134
- [chuckles]

28:38.134 --> 28:40.719
THIS IS ABOUT OUR NIGHT
IN THE TENT.

28:40.719 --> 28:45.516
- I CAN ASSURE YOU IT IS NOT.
- BUT I'VE BEEN HERE FOR MONTHS.

28:45.516 --> 28:47.143
MY TEMP POSITION'S ENDING,
AND I'M READY.

28:47.143 --> 28:48.727
- I WOULD LOVE
TO KEEP YOU AROUND,

28:48.727 --> 28:50.187
BUT UNCLE MATT'S NOT
GONNA LET ME HIRE SOMEONE

28:50.187 --> 28:51.773
WHO DOESN'T HAVE
A PROVEN TRACK RECORD.

28:51.773 --> 28:54.733
WHICH ALL THOSE PEOPLE
OUT THERE DO, OKAY?

28:54.733 --> 28:56.569
- LISTEN, IF YOU HAD
ONE SALE ON THE BOOKS,

28:56.569 --> 28:59.781
THIS WOULD BE
A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.365
- I'VE PUSHED COCKTAILS,
THAT'S SALES.

29:01.365 --> 29:02.783
- WAIT, WEREN'T YOU MOVING
TO MICHIGAN?

29:02.783 --> 29:04.201
I MEAN, YOU WANTED TO WORK
IN OUR ANN ARBOR OFFICE.

29:04.201 --> 29:05.494
- AND I CONVINCED
ALL THOSE CUSTOMERS

29:05.494 --> 29:07.163
YOU THOUGHT YOU LOST
TO RE-UP.

29:07.163 --> 29:08.956
- YOU GOT THEM ON THE HOOK,
BUT IT WAS THE SALES DEPARTMENT

29:08.956 --> 29:13.002
THAT CLOSED THE DEALS.
- [sighs]

29:15.796 --> 29:17.924
- HEY.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.968
YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT ASSET
TO THIS COMPANY.

29:19.968 --> 29:24.346
I'M REALLY SORRY.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.937
- I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
I BROUGHT YOU HERE.

29:31.937 --> 29:34.607
- FUCK YOU!
YOU NEVER TOOK ME SKATING.

29:34.607 --> 29:37.985
- ALWAYS TOOK YOU SKATING,
TO THE PARK, TO THE ZOO.

29:37.985 --> 29:39.945
YOU TRIED TO MAKE OFF
WITH A TORTOISE.

29:39.945 --> 29:41.614
- THAT WAS YOU.

29:41.614 --> 29:45.784
- HUH. GOOD MARKET
IN ENDANGERED SPECIES.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.662
- THAT'S 'CAUSE IT'S ILLEGAL,
FRANK.

29:48.662 --> 29:50.414
- BLEEDING HEART ECO-FASCIST.
- [chuckles]

29:50.414 --> 29:53.417
- IT'S CALLED SURVIVAL
OF THE FITTEST FOR A REASON.

29:53.417 --> 29:55.961
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ENDANGERED,
SPEED THE FUCK UP!

29:55.961 --> 29:59.007
- [laughs]
- GROW SOME OPPOSABLE THUMBS!

29:59.007 --> 30:01.926
OTHERWISE YOU END UP
ON EBAY FOR 10 GRAND,

30:01.926 --> 30:04.094
AS DARWIN INTENDED.

30:04.094 --> 30:06.305
- [coughs]

30:06.305 --> 30:07.556
UH-OH!

30:07.556 --> 30:08.891
[grunts]
ALL RIGHT.

30:08.891 --> 30:12.311
