Danny Pink... is dead.

00:03.700 --> 00:06.490
We're here to get your boyfriend
back from the dead.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.290
Those are tombs. Water tombs.

00:08.340 --> 00:10.660
Why would anyone go to
so much trouble?

00:12.100 --> 00:13.690
You're dead and...

00:13.740 --> 00:15.890
and this is what's next.

00:15.940 --> 00:17.610
A Gallifreyan hard drive.

00:17.660 --> 00:19.580
Time Lord technology.

00:20.820 --> 00:23.890
Do you know the key strategic
weakness of the human race?

00:23.940 --> 00:26.730
The dead outnumber
the living.

00:26.780 --> 00:27.930
Who are you?

00:27.980 --> 00:30.740
Oh, you know who I am.
I'm Missy.

00:32.060 --> 00:33.930
I couldn't very well
keep calling myself

00:33.980 --> 00:37.260
The Master, now - could I?

ELECTRONIC WHIRRING

00:48.220 --> 00:50.690
Stop! You can't kill me!

00:50.740 --> 00:52.170
Incorrect.

00:52.220 --> 00:55.650
I'm a target of strategic value.
Alive, I'm a tactical advantage.

00:55.700 --> 00:58.900
Dead, I'm your biggest mistake.
You don't know who I am!

01:00.900 --> 01:04.489
You are Clara Oswald. You are human.

01:04.540 --> 01:05.860
You are unimportant.

01:08.820 --> 01:12.690
Incorrect. You see, THAT is what
you're supposed to think.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.690
THAT is what everybody thinks.

01:14.740 --> 01:16.570
You are Clara Oswald.

01:16.620 --> 01:20.300
Clara Oswald is a cover story -
a disguise. There is NO Clara Oswald.

01:22.180 --> 01:25.090
~ Identify. ~ Oh, don't be so slow,
it's embarrassing.

01:25.140 --> 01:26.650
Who could fool you like this?

01:26.700 --> 01:29.530
Who could hide right under your nose?

01:29.580 --> 01:32.100
Who could change their face
any time they want?

01:33.620 --> 01:36.620
Hmm! You see, I'm not Clara Oswald.

01:37.980 --> 01:40.570
Clara Oswald has never existed.

01:40.620 --> 01:41.770
Identify.

01:41.820 --> 01:43.740

02:25.220 --> 02:26.930
Cybermen, in broad daylight?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.860
You think people won't notice?

02:34.660 --> 02:38.020
Photos with the big metal men -
one pound!

02:39.740 --> 02:41.020
Oh, honey!

02:42.540 --> 02:43.530
There you go.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.250
Oh, cool. Cool!

02:45.300 --> 02:48.010
New York. Paris. Rome. Marrakech.

Brisbane. Glasgow. Everywhere.

02:50.740 --> 02:54.730
Anywhere. Me and my boys.
We're going viral.

02:54.780 --> 02:56.930
Would you like me to take a picture?

02:56.980 --> 02:59.050
Sorry, selfies are never as good,
are they?

02:59.100 --> 03:00.970
And you're having a lovely moment.
Hang on!

03:01.020 --> 03:03.010
~ No, just... ~ Nice bow tie.

03:03.060 --> 03:06.090
Bow ties are cool. Big smiles, and...

03:06.140 --> 03:07.500
now!

03:08.620 --> 03:10.650
Move, move, move! Stand by.

03:10.700 --> 03:13.090
Surround target.

03:13.140 --> 03:14.180
Hold back!

03:16.980 --> 03:20.970
Afternoon. You've picked
a lovely day for it.

03:21.020 --> 03:23.490
My, don't you look shiny!

03:23.540 --> 03:25.810
~ Haircut? ~ Bit of a trim.

03:25.860 --> 03:27.010
Might want to do your roots.

03:27.060 --> 03:30.330
~ The woman. ~ Yes, ma'am. ~ Kate Stewart.

03:30.380 --> 03:33.450
Divorcee, mother of two, keen
gardener, outstanding bridge player.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.610
Also chief scientific officer,
Unified Intelligence Taskforce -

03:36.660 --> 03:38.690
who currently have you surrounded.

03:38.740 --> 03:41.970
Human weaponry is not
effective against Cyber technology.

03:42.020 --> 03:46.210
Sorry, you left this behind on one
of your previous attempts.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.130
So now that I have your attention,

03:48.180 --> 03:51.810
welcome to the only planet in the
universe where we get to say this.

03:51.860 --> 03:53.850
He's on the payroll.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.450
Am I?

03:55.500 --> 03:57.050
Well, technically.

03:57.100 --> 03:59.460
~ How much? ~ Sh! Any questions?

04:01.700 --> 04:03.890
SOLDIER: Back, back, everyone, back!

Oh, my God!

04:20.300 --> 04:23.410
Is it supposed to do that?
Is that new?

04:23.460 --> 04:26.490
A sun roof on St Paul's?!
Yes, I'd say that was new!

04:26.540 --> 04:29.410
There's going to be mass panic.
Everyone in London can see that.

04:29.460 --> 04:31.650
Everyone in London just clapped and
went "whee"!

04:31.700 --> 04:32.930
Hush, I'm trying to count.

04:32.980 --> 04:36.460
~ 87, I think. ~ OCD.

04:37.500 --> 04:38.540
91.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.530
Queen of evil.

04:40.580 --> 04:44.330
How could St Paul's be full of 91
Cybermen and nobody noticed?

04:44.380 --> 04:47.850
Dimensional engineering - one space
folded inside another.

04:47.900 --> 04:49.260
Bigger on the inside.

04:51.020 --> 04:52.610
Easy if you're a Time Lord.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.690
Mostly deploying south,
a smaller number east.

04:55.740 --> 04:59.050
~ Yep, but one straight up.
~ So 91 isn't a coincidence?

04:59.100 --> 05:00.450
Of course it isn't.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.170
Osgood? 91 - explain.

05:02.220 --> 05:04.930
91 areas of significant population
density in the British Isles.

05:04.980 --> 05:07.730
That's one Cyberman for every city
and major town.

05:07.780 --> 05:10.650
It's happening everywhere, all over
the world, right now!

05:10.700 --> 05:14.650
Sweet planet, this.
I think I might keep it.

05:14.700 --> 05:18.370
One Cyberman per city. What could
they hope to accomplish?

05:18.420 --> 05:20.260
Doctor!
EXPLOSION

05:24.380 --> 05:27.170
~ Has it exploded? ~ More than that.

05:27.220 --> 05:30.050
Cybermen don't just blow themselves
up for no good reason, dear -

05:30.100 --> 05:31.890
they're not human.

05:31.940 --> 05:34.250
~ If it isn't exploding,
what's it doing? ~ Pollinating.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.780
Falling like rain
into the cracks of the Earth.

05:44.860 --> 05:48.260
ELECTRICAL FIZZING AND BUZZING

05:51.460 --> 05:54.730
~ Well, this IS a bit exciting!
~ What's happening?

05:54.780 --> 05:56.330
Well, to cut a long story short,

05:56.380 --> 05:58.460
it looks like we might all be going
home.

05:59.940 --> 06:02.420
Home? From the afterlife?

06:03.580 --> 06:07.290
Well, when I said "afterlife",
I was being a tiny bit poetic.

06:07.340 --> 06:11.730
And Nethersphere is just a cool name
we come up with during a spit-ball.

06:11.780 --> 06:13.610
What is this place?

06:13.660 --> 06:17.050
Well, you have to
think of it as a data cloud.

06:17.100 --> 06:19.050
You know, for storing data.

06:19.100 --> 06:23.010
In this case, it's the storage
of recently deceased minds.

06:23.060 --> 06:24.210
We're in a cloud?

06:24.260 --> 06:25.770
A sort of cloud, yeah.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.250
And what's happening to it?

06:27.300 --> 06:31.490
What happens to any cloud
when it starts to rain.

06:31.540 --> 06:34.890
Are you telling me we're going back?
What, back to our bodies?

06:34.940 --> 06:38.210
And the extra good news is...

06:38.260 --> 06:40.650
there's been a bit of an upgrade.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.370
The dead are coming home, Doctor.

06:43.420 --> 06:46.410
All shiny and new.

06:46.460 --> 06:51.130
In 24 hours the human race
as you know it will cease to exist.

06:51.180 --> 06:54.170
What are you doing? Explain.
Tell me now!

06:54.220 --> 06:57.570
Oh! That was nice, must do it again.

06:57.620 --> 06:59.940
No. No, no, no, no, I need
to talk to her! I need her awake.

07:00.940 --> 07:02.330
Agh!

07:02.380 --> 07:06.250
No. No, no, stupid!

07:06.300 --> 07:09.300
Stupid! No, no! Agh!

07:14.220 --> 07:16.650
The first protocol is implemented.
We're good to go.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.050
You just have to let it take you.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.140
Ow!

07:20.140 --> 07:21.820
SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE

07:26.060 --> 07:27.660
What did he say?

07:29.900 --> 07:32.620
He said, "Guard the graveyards."
THUNDERCLAP

07:43.980 --> 07:46.340
That's weird. Look at that!

07:50.340 --> 07:53.500
THUNDER RUMBLES

07:59.300 --> 08:02.340
How come it's only raining
INSIDE the graveyard?

I'm sorry. In the event of an alien
incursion on this scale,

10:10.660 --> 10:12.290
Your co-operation is to be ensured

You have a history.

Do you think your father
would've done this?

10:18.460 --> 10:20.060
We both know he absolutely would.

10:21.500 --> 10:22.610
Who is she?

10:22.660 --> 10:24.370
Long story. Where's Clara?

10:24.420 --> 10:26.090
Clara Oswald, your assistant?

10:26.140 --> 10:27.930
My friend.
She was with me in St Paul's.

10:27.980 --> 10:29.090
The team's still on site

10:29.140 --> 10:31.610
but they've been unable to gain
access to the building.

10:31.660 --> 10:33.930
I want her found and brought here.
I need her with me.

10:33.980 --> 10:35.170
Then give the order.

10:35.220 --> 10:37.690
As soon as you're on board Boat One
your word is law.

10:37.740 --> 10:38.940
Quite literally.

10:44.300 --> 10:45.810
You got the TARDIS out, then?

10:45.860 --> 10:47.420
Yes, and St Paul's locked down.

10:54.100 --> 10:56.290
~ Where are we going? Cloudbase?
~ You mean the Valiant?

10:56.340 --> 10:57.690
Cloudbase was Thunderbirds.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.890
Too conspicuous. We need your
location concealed, not advertised.

11:00.940 --> 11:02.570
From now on you're a moving target.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.730
Ah, I see you're bringing Daddy
along, too. That's very sweet.

11:05.780 --> 11:06.890
Sir!

11:06.940 --> 11:09.850
Oh, don't do that. You look like
you're self-concussing,

11:09.900 --> 11:13.650
which would explain all of military
history, now I think about it.

11:13.700 --> 11:15.650
Colonel Ahmed, sir.
Privileged to meet you.

11:15.700 --> 11:18.930
Love your outfit, Colonel Ahmed.
Are you in the Scouts?

11:18.980 --> 11:21.060
Are you a Man Scout?
I didn't know they had those.

11:23.620 --> 11:25.290
~ It was Captain Scarlet. ~ Sorry?

11:25.340 --> 11:26.650
Not Thunderbirds.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.250
Oh, God, so it was!

11:28.300 --> 11:30.770
My confidence is growing
every minute.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.370
The President is on board.

11:32.420 --> 11:37.330
Mind you, me and Sylvia Anderson,
you've never seen a foxtrot like it.

11:37.380 --> 11:40.210
Hang on a second. The President?

11:40.260 --> 11:42.970
We don't want Americans
bobbing around the place.

11:43.020 --> 11:44.490
They'll only start praying.

11:44.540 --> 11:47.970
Not the President of America, sir.
The President of Earth.

11:48.020 --> 11:49.370
~ There isn't one. ~ There is now.

11:49.420 --> 11:52.210
The incursion protocols have been
agreed internationally.

11:52.260 --> 11:53.810
In the event of full-scale invasion,

11:53.860 --> 11:55.810
an Earth president is
inducted immediately,

11:55.860 --> 11:58.610
with complete authority
over every nation state.

11:58.660 --> 12:00.530
There was only
one practical candidate.

12:00.580 --> 12:03.330
That's your answer for everything,
isn't it? Vote for an idiot.

12:03.380 --> 12:06.570
If you say so, Mr President(!)
So long as you're on this plane,

12:06.620 --> 12:09.050
you're the Commander-in-Chief
of every army on Earth.

12:09.100 --> 12:12.210
Every world leader is currently
awaiting your instructions.

12:12.260 --> 12:15.610
You are the Chief Executive Officer
of the human race.

12:15.660 --> 12:17.450
Any questions?

12:17.500 --> 12:20.380
'This is your captain speaking.
Please prepare for take-off.'

12:22.020 --> 12:23.970
Well, gentlemen. Where to start?

12:24.020 --> 12:25.530
I was born on the planet Gallifrey,

12:25.580 --> 12:27.210
in the constellation
of Kasterborous.

12:27.260 --> 12:29.730
I'm a Time Lord, but my Prydonian
privileges were revoked

12:29.780 --> 12:31.450
when I stole a time capsule
and ran away.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.490
Currently piloting a Type 40 TARDIS.
Married four times, all deceased.

12:34.540 --> 12:37.330
My children and grandchildren
are missing, and I assume, dead.

12:37.380 --> 12:40.330
I have a non-Gallifreyan daughter,
created via genetic transfer.

12:40.380 --> 12:42.210
How much more do you need?
I'm the Doctor!

12:42.260 --> 12:44.650
This information is not proof.

12:44.700 --> 12:46.100
We require proof.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.250
~ How about my name? ~ Explain.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.170
Well, my name isn't "Doctor", is it?

12:51.220 --> 12:52.850
I don't even really have a doctorate.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.170
Well, Glasgow University,

12:54.220 --> 12:57.370
but then I accidentally graduated in
the wrong century, so technically...

12:57.420 --> 12:59.650
This information
cannot be confirmed.

12:59.700 --> 13:00.970
You are Clara Oswald.

13:01.020 --> 13:03.090
Ah, no! I'm not!

13:03.140 --> 13:06.210
Your deception is intended to
prolong your life.

13:06.260 --> 13:08.450
Your presence has not been ordered.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.610
Correct.

13:09.660 --> 13:10.930
You are Clara Oswald.

13:10.980 --> 13:12.770
Oh, seriously, this is getting old.

13:12.820 --> 13:14.210
Look, there is no Clara Oswald.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.810
I invented her. I made her up.

13:15.860 --> 13:18.770
Born 23rd November, 1986.

13:18.820 --> 13:21.690
Yeah, I chose that date.
Always liked it.

13:21.740 --> 13:26.170
Father - David James Oswald.
Mother - Elena Alison Oswald.

13:26.220 --> 13:29.250
Stories. Stories. Stories.
I made them up.

13:29.300 --> 13:32.380
Look, ask anybody who knows me.
I am an incredible liar.

13:34.900 --> 13:36.220
Correct.

13:40.060 --> 13:41.210
No order was given.

13:41.260 --> 13:42.490
Correct.

13:42.540 --> 13:44.540
You are not under Cyber control.

13:52.860 --> 13:53.900
Correct.

14:06.100 --> 14:07.700
Why are you still alive?

14:08.940 --> 14:10.690
You saved me!

14:10.740 --> 14:11.970
I saved Gallifrey.

14:12.020 --> 14:13.890
Yes, Gallifrey too, I suppose.

14:13.940 --> 14:17.290
There's always collateral damage
with you and me.

14:17.340 --> 14:18.580
It's our Paris.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.010
Gallifrey's lost
in another dimension.

14:23.060 --> 14:24.540
Yes and no.

14:26.260 --> 14:27.290
Meaning?

14:27.340 --> 14:29.170
Yes, it's in another dimension.

14:29.220 --> 14:32.260
No, it's not lost.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.330
You know where it is?

14:35.380 --> 14:36.610
Yep!

14:36.660 --> 14:38.860
You know the best part
about knowing?

14:41.220 --> 14:43.940
(Not... telling... you!)

14:47.340 --> 14:50.180
TANNOY: 'Mr President, sir,
we're ready for you up here.'

14:53.100 --> 14:56.300
Remember all those years, when all
you wanted to do was rule the world?

14:57.500 --> 15:00.770
~ On my way.
~ 'Thank you, Mr President.'

15:00.820 --> 15:02.140
Piece of cake!

15:10.060 --> 15:12.450
Oh, erm.
It's her little device thingy.

15:12.500 --> 15:16.130
I thought there might be useful
information on it. Who is she?

15:16.180 --> 15:18.130
You'd never believe me
if I told you.

15:18.180 --> 15:21.650
Cos I thought she might be the
Master, regenerated into female form.

15:21.700 --> 15:24.980
Your childhood friend, responsible
for a number of previous incursions.

15:27.180 --> 15:28.530
That was fairly quick.

15:28.580 --> 15:30.930
We do have files on all
our ex-prime ministers.

15:30.980 --> 15:32.810
She wasn't even the worst.

15:32.860 --> 15:36.130
~ Doctor, there's something
nobody's talking about. ~ Which is?

15:36.180 --> 15:38.410
The clouds caused by
the exploding Cybermen -

15:38.460 --> 15:40.810
they haven't dispersed,
they're still there.

15:40.860 --> 15:45.490
In fact, they've expanded and are
covering almost all the land masses.

15:45.540 --> 15:47.170
We're all looking at the graveyards.

15:47.220 --> 15:49.460
Maybe we should be looking up.

15:52.620 --> 15:54.580
What do you think?

15:59.700 --> 16:02.650
~ All of time and space. ~ Sorry?

16:02.700 --> 16:04.740
Just something for your bucket list.

These scenes are being repeated

every hospital -

16:36.660 --> 16:38.770

Hello?

Hello?

18:04.620 --> 18:07.570
We've done heat scans of some of
the cemeteries and, in each case,

18:07.620 --> 18:10.210
only a handful of Cybermen
have so far emerged.

18:10.260 --> 18:13.410
~ But every individual burial site

18:13.460 --> 18:17.290

Potentially millions.

18:17.340 --> 18:20.170
So the rain caused all that
in just a few hours?

18:20.220 --> 18:24.130
It wasn't rain, Man Scout!
It was pollen. Cyber-pollen.

18:24.180 --> 18:27.250
Every tiny particle of a Cyberman
contains the plans

18:27.300 --> 18:28.730
to make another Cyberman.

18:28.780 --> 18:31.610
All it has to do is to make
a contact with compatible,

18:31.660 --> 18:34.420
living organic matter, and bang -
full conversion.

18:36.140 --> 18:39.500
But if they have learned
how to convert the dead...

18:41.540 --> 18:43.020
(That's what she was doing!)

18:44.340 --> 18:46.890
(That's what 3W was for!)

18:46.940 --> 18:50.450
She creates an all-new paranoia
among the super-rich about dying.

18:50.500 --> 18:54.770
She exploits the wealth and the
mortal remains of selected idiots,

18:54.820 --> 18:59.210
so she can create a whole new race
of Cybermen.

18:59.260 --> 19:02.290
Cybermen who can recruit corpses.

19:02.340 --> 19:06.170
Throw away your guns,
Man Scout, it's all over.

19:06.220 --> 19:10.340
How can you win a war against an
enemy that can weaponise the dead?

19:46.500 --> 19:49.010
They're not attacking, apart from
isolated incidents.

19:49.060 --> 19:51.970
~ They're just wandering about.
~ They're newborns. Give them time.

19:52.020 --> 19:54.770
Why were you there this morning,
why were you already attacking?

19:54.820 --> 19:57.410
Been investigating 3W for a while
then we got a tip-off.

19:57.460 --> 19:59.170
From a woman with a Scottish accent.

19:59.220 --> 20:02.170
Can't play to the gallery unless
there's a gallery and here I am.

20:02.220 --> 20:05.050
Dead bodies don't have minds,
of course,

20:05.100 --> 20:08.970
but she's been upgrading dying minds
to a hard drive for a long time.

20:09.020 --> 20:12.010
So she upgrades the hardware,
then she updates the software.

20:12.060 --> 20:14.450
What do you mean "a long time"?
How long?

20:14.500 --> 20:16.130
Well, she must have
a TARDIS somewhere,

20:16.180 --> 20:19.500
~ so as long as she likes, the past,
the future... ~ How long, Doctor?

20:20.940 --> 20:23.850
How long has the human race
had a concept of an afterlife?

20:23.900 --> 20:26.370
Turns out, the afterlife is real.

20:26.420 --> 20:28.180
And it's emptying.

20:29.580 --> 20:31.490
Every graveyard on planet Earth

20:31.540 --> 20:34.260

20:53.180 --> 20:56.890
Hi. Can I tell you something
really important?

20:56.940 --> 20:58.180
What?

21:00.100 --> 21:01.770
(I have to whisper it.)

21:01.820 --> 21:06.410
(It's, like, so important
to everyone on this plane.)

21:06.460 --> 21:09.490
~ You'll get in trouble if you don't
listen. ~ Right, If it was important,

21:09.540 --> 21:12.170
~ why would you tell us?
~ Well, look at me, I'm bananas.

21:12.220 --> 21:14.650
(Come on.) Just a wee bit closer.

21:14.700 --> 21:18.010
Just a little closer. The Doctor
will be really impressed

21:18.060 --> 21:20.020
if you learn my secrets.

21:29.620 --> 21:31.050
You can come a bit closer than that.

21:31.100 --> 21:32.890
Come on, stop mucking about.
Don't be shy.

21:32.940 --> 21:35.500
You don't smell half as bad
as you think you do.

21:38.460 --> 21:41.170
~ There are two armed men directly
behind you. ~ (Yeah, yeah, yeah.)

21:41.220 --> 21:43.250
If you've got something to say,
just say it.

21:43.300 --> 21:44.780

21:55.420 --> 21:57.210
I'm not even kidding.

21:57.260 --> 22:00.290
You're going to be as dead as a fish
on a slab any second now,

22:00.340 --> 22:01.970
all floppy and making smells.

22:02.020 --> 22:03.420
(But don't tell the boys.)

22:04.340 --> 22:07.130
(This is our secret girl plan.)

22:07.180 --> 22:10.970
~ Why would you bother killing me?
I'm not even important. ~ Oh, silly!

22:11.020 --> 22:13.690
Why does one pop a balloon?

22:13.740 --> 22:15.610
Because you're pretty.

22:15.660 --> 22:18.970
You should have a bit more
confidence in yourself.

22:19.020 --> 22:22.930
~ OK. Sorry, I've got work to do.
~ All right, fine.

22:22.980 --> 22:24.690
You get on.

22:24.740 --> 22:28.410
You get that finished. Would a
countdown help you focus at all?

22:28.460 --> 22:31.610
~ No, that's OK. ~ Ten. Don't be scared
yet, cos I'm still in double figures.

22:31.660 --> 22:33.890
~ I'm not scared. ~ Nine. Well, no,
of course you're not,

22:33.940 --> 22:35.770
cos you know you're dying,
anyway. Eight.

22:35.820 --> 22:38.330
Human beings are born dying.
Your life spans are hilarious.

22:38.380 --> 22:39.690
Please be quiet.

22:39.740 --> 22:43.690
Seven. You know from the minute
you slop out,

22:43.740 --> 22:45.850
you're rotting, decaying.

22:45.900 --> 22:47.890

~ Three. ~ Three?!

22:51.500 --> 22:54.980
I'm accelerating for
dramatic effect. Oh!

22:56.740 --> 22:59.010
What's THAT in your pocket?

22:59.060 --> 23:00.650
There's nothing in my...

23:00.700 --> 23:04.050
Oh, my giddy aunt.

23:04.100 --> 23:07.370

~ Well, those aren't mine.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.020
Hmm...

23:14.780 --> 23:16.380
Then they must be mine.

23:29.620 --> 23:31.090
Oh, yeah, that's true.

23:31.140 --> 23:33.770
That's definitely true, that is
a good point well made.

23:33.820 --> 23:35.250

24:15.180 --> 24:16.500

27:49.380 --> 27:52.020
They're all over the plane,
they're pulling it apart!

27:53.780 --> 27:56.090
Oh, o-o-oh.

27:56.140 --> 27:57.570
Ask me.

27:57.620 --> 27:59.140
Shut up!

28:00.180 --> 28:04.050
Ask me! Come on, you know you want
to. You want to know what my plan is.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.530
You'll be surprised.

28:06.580 --> 28:08.730
I've got a gift for you.

28:08.780 --> 28:11.770
You know, I've been up and down
your timeline,

28:11.820 --> 28:15.490
meeting all those silly people
who die to keep you alive.

28:15.540 --> 28:17.570
And you know what I worked out?

28:17.620 --> 28:20.090
~ What you really need! ~ For what?

28:20.140 --> 28:21.810
To know that you're just like me!

28:21.860 --> 28:26.130
PHONE RINGS
Oh, and now it begins.

28:26.180 --> 28:28.410
PHONE CONTINUES RINGING

28:28.460 --> 28:32.290
Doctor, I do believe you're on-call.

28:32.340 --> 28:35.010
Miss Oswald expects.

28:35.060 --> 28:39.810
Who else but the girl
who's got your number? Whoops!

28:39.860 --> 28:42.620
PHONE CONTINUES RINGING

28:44.540 --> 28:45.660
It was you!

28:48.020 --> 28:50.730
~ Ah, hello.
~ Where did you get this number?

28:50.780 --> 28:52.570
'The woman in the shop wrote it
down.'

28:52.620 --> 28:54.170
It's a helpline, isn't it?

28:54.220 --> 28:56.490
ENGLISH ACCENT: Computer helpline,
love.

28:56.540 --> 28:58.410
That's the one.

28:58.460 --> 29:01.420
Best helpline in the universe.

29:03.540 --> 29:05.170
You put us together.

29:05.220 --> 29:07.490
I kept you together.

29:07.540 --> 29:10.250
~ Who put that advert in the paper?
~ Who gave you my number?

29:10.300 --> 29:12.010
The woman - the woman in the shop.

29:12.060 --> 29:15.330
Then there's a woman out there who's
very keen that we stay together.

29:15.380 --> 29:19.050
~ Why? ~ Cos she's perfect, innit?

29:19.100 --> 29:22.730
The control freak and the man
who should never be controlled.

29:22.780 --> 29:26.330
You'd go to hell, if she asked.
And she would.

29:26.380 --> 29:28.770
The phone's ringing, Doctor,
can you hear that?

29:28.820 --> 29:34.140
Now that's the sound of your chain
being yanked. Heel, Doctor!

29:36.060 --> 29:40.210
MIMICS CLARA: Help me, Doctor!
Help me! Help me, Doctor!

29:40.260 --> 29:41.530
Clara?

29:41.580 --> 29:42.620
Doctor.

29:43.620 --> 29:44.690
With Danny.

29:44.740 --> 29:47.570
~ Danny's dead, Clara. ~ 'Not yet.'

29:47.620 --> 29:50.410
Not quite. But he wants to be.

29:50.460 --> 29:51.970
'Clara...'

29:52.020 --> 29:55.210
DANNY SOBS QUIETLY

29:55.260 --> 29:57.060
Clara?

29:59.980 --> 30:01.650
He's a Cyberman.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.330
'Doctor, Danny's a Cyberman.'

30:04.380 --> 30:06.330
And he's crying.

30:06.380 --> 30:09.660
Doctor, he feels it, he's crying.

30:14.340 --> 30:17.010
Message to Geneva.
Tell them Boat One is going down.

30:17.060 --> 30:19.380
We don't anticipate survivors.

30:22.140 --> 30:24.020
ALARM BLARES

30:26.100 --> 30:27.690
HE YELLS

30:27.740 --> 30:30.810
Clara, don't do it,
just don't do it!

30:30.860 --> 30:32.730
It's in his chest.

30:32.780 --> 30:34.250
He says it's an inhibitor.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.010
It can delete emotion, or something.

30:36.060 --> 30:37.410
I know what it does.

30:37.460 --> 30:40.690
If you turn it on,
he'll become a Cyberman.

30:40.740 --> 30:41.890
He's already a Cyberman.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.180
Not yet, he isn't.

30:44.540 --> 30:47.010
He's hurting because I hurt him
and he wants it to stop.

30:47.060 --> 30:48.980
Stop the pain and he'll kill you!

30:51.380 --> 30:54.170
Look, are you going to help me?
Because I can't do this alone.

30:54.220 --> 30:56.210
I'm not going to help you
commit suicide.

30:56.260 --> 30:58.930
Look, the TARDIS can
home in on this call, right?

30:58.980 --> 31:02.060
Either you help me,
or you leave me alone.

31:03.180 --> 31:04.460
Clara? Clara, no...

31:10.900 --> 31:12.570
There's a lot of switches
round the edge.

31:12.620 --> 31:14.050
I'm going to try pressing them all.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.540
OK.

31:25.420 --> 31:26.780
I am so sorry.

31:28.580 --> 31:29.820
Yeah.

31:30.900 --> 31:33.290
Doctor! The Cybermen are in!

31:33.340 --> 31:34.690
The plane's going down!

31:34.740 --> 31:39.260
Oh, great. It's the daughter one.
Do you like her? I like her.

31:40.940 --> 31:42.980
KATE YELLS

31:45.340 --> 31:47.050
Aaaaaargh!

31:47.100 --> 31:49.740
Why did you do that?
You didn't have to do that!

31:53.340 --> 31:57.210
Oh, don't be so selfish.
I'm going to miss her, too.

31:57.260 --> 32:00.850
In fact, you know what?
Just for that, I'm leaving.

32:00.900 --> 32:06.180
Boys, blow up this plane and,
I don't know... Belgium, yeah?

32:08.140 --> 32:09.970
Kill some Belgians.

32:10.020 --> 32:12.410
Might as well.
They're not even French.

32:12.460 --> 32:14.020
Byeeee!

32:17.060 --> 32:18.900
Aargh!

32:20.620 --> 32:22.580
Aaargh! Argh! Argh!

32:26.140 --> 32:27.930
HE YELLS

32:27.980 --> 32:29.980
Aargh... argh...

32:31.140 --> 32:32.860
Well, that's very boring.

32:35.100 --> 32:36.570
Oh, he's just going to...

32:36.620 --> 32:38.060
squish.

32:39.180 --> 32:41.010
What kind of a way is that to die?

32:41.060 --> 32:43.650
That man has NO finesse, none.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.170
Well, it's quite dramatic.

32:45.220 --> 32:49.460
You're an AI interface, kindly
delete your opinions, thank you.

32:53.940 --> 32:55.450
W-W-What's he doing? Is he...?

32:55.500 --> 32:56.540
Is he?

33:00.100 --> 33:02.410
Oh, no!

33:02.460 --> 33:04.620
Oh, no, no, no. N-Now, that's...

33:15.060 --> 33:16.490
Oh!

33:16.540 --> 33:19.100
Permission to... squeeeee...

33:42.700 --> 33:44.740
METALLIC THRUMMING

33:47.900 --> 33:49.690
Two more to go.
Does it feel any different?

33:49.740 --> 33:50.810
No.

33:50.860 --> 33:51.970
THUDDING

33:52.020 --> 33:53.060
Are you sure?

33:54.100 --> 33:55.410
Yeah.

33:55.460 --> 33:57.650
THUNDER RUMBLING

33:57.700 --> 33:59.340
Clara, don't!

34:02.820 --> 34:03.890
Help me.

34:03.940 --> 34:06.890
If you do what you're trying to do,
if you succeed, he will snap you.

34:06.940 --> 34:09.210
~ No. ~ Then he will step over
your broken body and break

34:09.260 --> 34:11.610
another and another and another.
He will never stop.

34:11.659 --> 34:12.860
I will not harm her.

34:25.179 --> 34:26.460
PE...

34:27.420 --> 34:28.969
PE...

34:29.020 --> 34:30.380
Sir.

34:36.179 --> 34:37.460
I had a friend once.

34:38.620 --> 34:40.100
We ran together, when I was little.

34:41.340 --> 34:43.139
And I thought we were the same.

34:44.260 --> 34:46.060
But when we grew up, we weren't.

34:47.219 --> 34:50.610
Now, she's trying to
tear the world apart,

34:50.659 --> 34:53.739
and I can't run fast enough to
hold it together. The difference...

34:56.860 --> 34:58.410
.. is this.

34:58.460 --> 35:00.340
Pain is a gift.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.810
Without the capacity for pain,

35:03.860 --> 35:06.650
we can't feel the hurt we inflict.

35:06.700 --> 35:10.490
Are you telling me,
seriously, for real, that you can?

35:10.540 --> 35:11.970
Of course I can.

35:12.020 --> 35:13.850
Then shame on you, Doctor.

35:13.900 --> 35:15.140
Yes.

35:16.620 --> 35:18.100
Oh, yes.

35:21.780 --> 35:25.130
LOW RUMBLE

35:25.180 --> 35:27.010
Danny, Danny,

35:27.060 --> 35:28.850
I need you to tell me,

35:28.900 --> 35:30.210
what are the clouds going to do?

35:30.260 --> 35:31.890
What is the plan?

35:31.940 --> 35:35.410
~ How would I know?
~ You're part of a hive mind now.

35:35.460 --> 35:38.010
Presumably, that's how you
found Clara.

35:38.060 --> 35:39.770
Just look.

35:39.820 --> 35:41.650
I can't see much.

35:41.700 --> 35:42.860
Look harder.

35:44.660 --> 35:46.290
Clara, watch this.

35:46.340 --> 35:48.690
This is who the Doctor is.

35:48.740 --> 35:51.850
Watch the blood-soaked
old general in action.

35:51.900 --> 35:56.450
I can't see properly, sir,
because this needs activating.

35:56.500 --> 36:01.180
If you want to know what's coming,
you have to switch... it... on.

36:02.780 --> 36:06.490
And didn't all of those beautiful
speeches just disappear

36:06.540 --> 36:08.620
in the face of a tactical advantage?

36:10.620 --> 36:12.380
Sir?

36:22.100 --> 36:24.220
THE DOCTOR SIGHS

36:25.220 --> 36:26.780
I need to know.

36:30.260 --> 36:31.610
I need to know.

36:31.660 --> 36:33.220
(Yes.)

36:34.220 --> 36:35.500
Yes, you do.

36:37.580 --> 36:39.340
Give me the screwdriver.

36:40.460 --> 36:42.900
~ No. ~ Just do it, Doctor.

36:44.340 --> 36:45.580
Do as you are told.

36:56.340 --> 36:57.660
Typical officer.

36:58.580 --> 37:00.500
Got to keep those hands clean.

37:09.460 --> 37:11.530
Just point and think, yeah?

37:11.580 --> 37:12.860
Yes.

37:14.740 --> 37:15.860
OK.

37:22.660 --> 37:24.130
I wasn't very good at it...

37:24.180 --> 37:25.540
but I did love you.

37:27.180 --> 37:28.380
I loved you, too.

37:32.140 --> 37:33.980
I'm never going to say that again.

37:35.060 --> 37:36.340
Me neither.

37:40.460 --> 37:41.970
Ready?

37:42.020 --> 37:43.260
Yeah.

37:44.900 --> 37:46.170
SHE SOBS

37:46.220 --> 37:47.850
It feels like I'm killing you.

37:47.900 --> 37:48.930
HE SCOFFS

37:48.980 --> 37:50.540
I'm already dead.

37:51.860 --> 37:53.770
You're here this time at least.

37:53.820 --> 37:55.620
Goodbye, Danny.

37:58.180 --> 37:59.780
Goodbye, Clara.

38:03.060 --> 38:05.300
ELECTRICAL BUZZING

38:09.300 --> 38:10.490
Oh...

38:10.540 --> 38:13.210
Clara, no! Step away!
He's activating!

38:13.260 --> 38:14.980
Clara, step away now! Don't...

38:17.300 --> 38:20.970
Danny, Danny, if you can hear me,
if you're still there,

38:21.020 --> 38:22.850
what are the clouds going to do?

38:22.900 --> 38:24.500
The rain will fall again.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.020
All humanity will die.

38:28.140 --> 38:30.130
And rise again as Cybermen?

38:30.180 --> 38:31.890
Correct.

38:31.940 --> 38:33.530
How do we stop it?

38:33.580 --> 38:34.970
We cannot be stopped.

38:35.020 --> 38:38.180
WHOOSHING

38:39.500 --> 38:42.100
Oh, that was BRILLIANT!

38:43.220 --> 38:46.970
I love the telly here,
but did you see THAT?

38:47.020 --> 38:49.290
Oh, Clara,

38:49.340 --> 38:51.810
you poor thing,
you must feel like death.

38:51.860 --> 38:53.530
Let me pop away the pain.

38:53.580 --> 38:55.850
Don't you dare!
Don't you think about it!

38:55.900 --> 38:58.210
Oh, sorry, hon, I'm just getting
a bit carried away.

38:58.260 --> 39:00.770
It's your friends,
they're so more-ish.

39:00.820 --> 39:02.650
Hmm?

39:02.700 --> 39:04.970
Oh, stop looking all cross-pants.

39:05.020 --> 39:07.450
I'm here to give you a gift.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.810
Could you at least try
and be excited?

39:09.860 --> 39:11.540
What gift?

39:13.500 --> 39:15.730
Cyberdears!

39:15.780 --> 39:18.130
Look at Mummy!!

39:18.180 --> 39:19.770
Raise your arms.

39:19.820 --> 39:21.410
Lower your arms.

39:21.460 --> 39:22.970
Raise your right.

39:23.020 --> 39:25.540
Lower your right. Turn on the spot.

39:27.580 --> 39:31.460
There are exits at the front
and rear of the aircraft.

39:32.940 --> 39:36.530
Please follow the lights up
the aisle. You see, Doctor?

39:36.580 --> 39:38.770
The power to slaughter
whole worlds at a time,

39:38.820 --> 39:41.300
then make them do a safety briefing.

39:42.420 --> 39:46.330
Everyone who ever lived - man, woman
and child - is now at my command.

39:46.380 --> 39:49.650
An indestructible army
to rage across the universe.

39:49.700 --> 39:52.060
The more they kill,
the more they recruit.

39:54.620 --> 39:56.060
Happy birthday.

39:58.380 --> 40:00.740
Oh! You didn't know, did you?

40:02.180 --> 40:04.860
It's lucky one of us
remembers these things.

40:06.100 --> 40:07.460
Happy birthday...

40:09.380 --> 40:12.980
♪ Mr President. ♪

40:16.220 --> 40:17.890
Doctor.

40:17.940 --> 40:19.180
Tiny bit pleased?

40:23.780 --> 40:25.730
Oh, go on, crack a smile.

40:25.780 --> 40:27.850
I want to see
if your eyebrows drop off.

40:27.900 --> 40:29.930
All of this...

40:29.980 --> 40:32.130
All of it, just to give me an army?

40:32.180 --> 40:34.050
Well, I don't need one, do I?

40:34.100 --> 40:36.650
Armies are for people
who think they're right.

40:36.700 --> 40:39.140
And nobody thinks they're
righter than you!

40:40.580 --> 40:42.410
Give a good man firepower,

40:42.460 --> 40:44.170
and he'll never run
out of people to kill.

40:44.220 --> 40:47.730
~ I don't want an army. ~ Well,
that's the trouble! Yes, you do!

40:47.780 --> 40:50.090
You've always wanted one!

40:50.140 --> 40:52.450
All those people
suffering in the Dalek camps?

40:52.500 --> 40:54.610
Now you can save them.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.570
All those bad guys
winning all the wars?

40:56.620 --> 40:58.530
Go and get the good guys back.

40:58.580 --> 41:01.850
~ Nobody can have that power. ~ You will
because you don't have a choice.

41:01.900 --> 41:05.850
There's only way you can stop
these clouds from opening up

41:05.900 --> 41:08.570
and killing all your little pets
down here.

41:08.620 --> 41:11.410
Conquer the universe, Mr President.

41:11.460 --> 41:14.100
Show a bad girl how it's done.

41:15.380 --> 41:17.090
Why are you doing this?

41:17.140 --> 41:19.460
I need you to know
we're not so different.

41:22.380 --> 41:24.420
I need my friend back.

41:25.740 --> 41:27.130
Every battle,

41:27.180 --> 41:29.370
every war, every invasion -

41:29.420 --> 41:32.490
from now on,
you decide the outcome.

41:32.540 --> 41:34.740
What's the matter, Mr President?

41:36.180 --> 41:37.700
Don't you trust yourself?

41:40.700 --> 41:42.410
'Tell me.'

41:42.460 --> 41:43.740
Am I a good man?

41:45.220 --> 41:46.300
Sir!

41:54.340 --> 41:57.530
DAVROS: I see into your soul, Doctor.

41:57.580 --> 42:00.130
I see...

42:00.180 --> 42:02.500
hatred.

42:04.740 --> 42:05.850
I'm not a hero.

42:05.900 --> 42:08.940
You are a good Dalek.

42:16.380 --> 42:17.770
Thank you!

42:17.820 --> 42:19.300
Thank you so much.

42:21.420 --> 42:23.250
I really didn't know. I wasn't sure.

42:23.300 --> 42:25.420
You lose sight sometimes. Thank you!

42:26.700 --> 42:29.620
I am NOT a good man!

42:32.420 --> 42:33.980
And I'm not a bad man.

42:35.180 --> 42:37.650
I am not a hero.

42:37.700 --> 42:39.450
And I'm definitely not a president.

42:39.500 --> 42:42.610
And, no, I'm not an officer.

42:42.660 --> 42:44.250
Do you know what I am?

42:44.300 --> 42:45.930
I...

42:45.980 --> 42:47.370
am...

42:47.420 --> 42:48.850
an idiot,

42:48.900 --> 42:50.690
with a box

42:50.740 --> 42:52.370
and a screwdriver.

42:52.420 --> 42:54.010
Passing through,

42:54.060 --> 42:55.330
helping out,

42:55.380 --> 42:56.570
learning.

42:56.620 --> 42:59.090
I don't need an army, I never have,
because I've got them.

42:59.140 --> 43:01.330
Always them.

43:01.380 --> 43:04.100
Because love,
it's not an emotion....

43:05.700 --> 43:07.100
.. love is a promise.

43:09.820 --> 43:12.850
And HE will NEVER hurt her.

43:12.900 --> 43:14.580
PE, catch!

43:18.060 --> 43:19.650
You didn't notice, did you?

43:19.700 --> 43:21.650
While you where doing
all your silly orders,

43:21.700 --> 43:23.050
while you where showing off,

43:23.100 --> 43:24.570
the one soldier not obeying.

43:24.620 --> 43:26.620
No, that's wrong, that's impossible.

43:28.460 --> 43:29.970
The rain will not fall.

43:30.020 --> 43:32.290
Oh? Why won't it?

43:32.340 --> 43:33.570
The clouds will burn.

43:33.620 --> 43:35.890
~ And who'll burn them?
~ I will burn them.

43:35.940 --> 43:37.290
How?

43:37.340 --> 43:39.050
I will burn.

43:39.100 --> 43:42.500
One burning Cyberman is
hardly going to save the planet.

43:43.900 --> 43:45.740
Correct.

43:49.660 --> 43:51.900
Attention!

43:53.900 --> 43:55.530
This is not a good day.

43:55.580 --> 43:58.010
This is Earth's darkest hour.

43:58.060 --> 44:00.420
And look at you miserable lot!

44:01.660 --> 44:03.370
We are the fallen.

44:03.420 --> 44:05.450
But today, we shall rise.

44:05.500 --> 44:09.060
The army of the dead
will save the land of the living.

44:10.020 --> 44:12.180
This is not
the order of a general...

44:13.540 --> 44:14.890
.. nor the whim of a lunatic.

44:14.940 --> 44:16.530
Excuse me?!

44:16.580 --> 44:17.860
This is a promise!

44:19.220 --> 44:21.180
The promise of a soldier!

44:24.940 --> 44:26.380
You will sleep safe tonight.

45:13.340 --> 45:14.780
Well.

45:15.820 --> 45:17.610
The clouds have all gone.

45:17.660 --> 45:19.050
Yes,

45:19.100 --> 45:20.410
burned up,

45:20.460 --> 45:22.450
totally burnt,

45:22.500 --> 45:24.460
burnt to nothing.

45:29.380 --> 45:30.490
Sorry.

45:30.540 --> 45:33.770
10-0-11-00 by 02.

45:33.820 --> 45:35.690
What did you say??

45:35.740 --> 45:38.570
The current co-ordinates
of Gallifrey.

45:38.620 --> 45:40.730
It's returned to
it's original location.

45:40.780 --> 45:43.140
~ Didn't you ever think to look?
~ You are lying!

45:44.300 --> 45:45.770
We can... We can go together.

45:45.820 --> 45:47.610
Just you and me,
just like the old days.

45:47.660 --> 45:49.250
You'd be clapped in irons.

45:49.300 --> 45:50.890
If you like.

45:50.940 --> 45:53.620
Doctor, I'm assuming
you'll remember those co-ordinates?

45:55.300 --> 45:57.410
No. No, don't you dare,
I won't let you.

45:57.460 --> 45:59.060
Old friend, is she?

46:01.140 --> 46:02.770
If you have ever let
this creature live,

46:02.820 --> 46:04.610
everything that happened today,
is on you.

46:04.660 --> 46:06.940
All of it, on YOU.

46:08.500 --> 46:10.330
And you're not going to
let her live again.

46:10.380 --> 46:15.210
Clara... all I'm doing is not
letting you kill her.

46:15.260 --> 46:17.500
I never said I was letting her live.

46:20.260 --> 46:21.770
Really?

46:21.820 --> 46:24.700
If that's the only thing
that will stop you...

46:26.060 --> 46:27.460
.. yes.

46:37.820 --> 46:39.900
Seriously(?)

46:41.540 --> 46:42.930
(Oh...)

46:42.980 --> 46:44.700
(Doctor.)

46:46.420 --> 46:47.780
To save her soul?

46:50.820 --> 46:52.420
SHE CHUCKLES

46:54.340 --> 46:56.900
But who, my dear, will save yours?

46:59.380 --> 47:01.180
Say something nice.

47:05.060 --> 47:06.610
HE SIGHS

47:06.660 --> 47:08.340
Please?

47:10.500 --> 47:11.820
You win.

47:13.740 --> 47:14.940
I know.

47:30.380 --> 47:31.980
Doctor!

47:39.300 --> 47:40.930
Kate!

47:40.980 --> 47:43.530
She's breathing.

47:43.580 --> 47:45.290
She's alive! She can't be here!

47:45.340 --> 47:46.930
She is.

47:46.980 --> 47:48.380
She fell out of a plane!

47:51.300 --> 47:52.380
The Cyberman...

47:53.940 --> 47:55.180
.. must have caught her.

47:57.100 --> 47:58.530
Doctor,

47:58.580 --> 48:00.580
she's talking about her dad!

48:04.740 --> 48:06.370
Of course!

48:06.420 --> 48:07.890
The Earth's darkest hour

48:07.940 --> 48:08.980
and mine.

48:10.020 --> 48:12.100
Where else would you be?

48:27.660 --> 48:29.420
(Thank you.)

48:36.420 --> 48:38.460
SIREN WAILS IN THE DISTANCE

48:51.740 --> 48:53.100
Danny?

48:54.620 --> 48:56.780
Danny? Is that you?

48:58.260 --> 48:59.420
Please say it's you.

49:06.220 --> 49:08.890
~ 'Clara...' ~ The Doctor told me
about the bracelet,

49:08.940 --> 49:11.330
how it can let Missy travel
from one world to the other.

49:11.380 --> 49:12.930
'This place is dying now.'

49:12.980 --> 49:16.410
Yes, but the bracelet
can bring you home.

49:16.460 --> 49:18.410
'There's only enough power
for one trip.'

49:18.460 --> 49:21.210
Then, come on. Hurry up!

49:21.260 --> 49:22.690
'Just one trip.

49:22.740 --> 49:24.620
'One trip, one person.'

49:29.340 --> 49:30.660
Danny!

49:39.580 --> 49:41.260
'You need to find his parents.

49:42.580 --> 49:44.100
'He died a long time ago.'

50:16.780 --> 50:19.220
~ Two weeks late. ~ Not bad. ~ Improving.

50:21.420 --> 50:24.050
~ I see you've got news for me. ~ News?

50:24.100 --> 50:26.250
He figured it out then?

50:26.300 --> 50:29.370
PE figured out there was a way home.

50:29.420 --> 50:31.410
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

50:31.460 --> 50:34.690
Oh, good old PE.
He'll make a maths teacher yet.

50:34.740 --> 50:40.060
Listen, Doctor. There's something
that I have to tell you and, um...

50:42.300 --> 50:45.780
~ .. it's not good news
so just listen, OK? ~ I know.

50:48.180 --> 50:50.490
~ Sorry? ~ I know exactly
what you've got to tell me.

50:50.540 --> 50:53.530
~ You do?
~ You and Danny are together now.

50:53.580 --> 50:55.370
That's great,
that's how it should be.

50:55.420 --> 50:59.010
But the old man and the blue box,
that's never going to fit in.

50:59.060 --> 51:02.290
So, no more flying around,
no more lying.

51:02.340 --> 51:04.730
~ OK, no, that's not exactly...
~ It's fine.

51:04.780 --> 51:06.170
No, it's NOT fine.

51:06.220 --> 51:09.330
It... It really isn't... fine.

51:09.380 --> 51:11.380
I've found Gallifrey!

51:14.300 --> 51:15.500
Wow!

51:16.740 --> 51:18.260
Oh, my God...

51:22.220 --> 51:24.490

51:24.540 --> 51:26.300
'just like she said.'

51:27.980 --> 51:30.300
And I found Gallifrey.

51:43.660 --> 51:46.380
For once, she wasn't lying.

52:44.140 --> 52:46.060
So, what are you going to do now?

52:47.420 --> 52:48.970
Go home.

52:49.020 --> 52:50.260
OK.

52:51.900 --> 52:54.530
Gallifrey can be a good place.

52:54.580 --> 52:56.250
I can help make it that.

52:56.300 --> 52:57.970
~ What, you? ~ Shut up!

52:58.020 --> 52:59.970
You won't just steal a TARDIS
and run away?

53:00.020 --> 53:02.260
No, not this time. Never again.

53:06.620 --> 53:07.700
Never again.

53:09.260 --> 53:13.210
It's a long commute, so, you know
I thought, with you and Danny...

53:13.260 --> 53:15.420
Yeah. Me and Danny.

53:21.580 --> 53:23.810
Me and Danny,
we are going to be fine.

53:23.860 --> 53:26.260
Don't you worry. You go home.

53:28.300 --> 53:29.610
Go home.

53:29.660 --> 53:31.020
Go be a king or something.

53:32.660 --> 53:34.730
Yeah, I might do that.

53:34.780 --> 53:36.690
Or queen, you know, whatever.

53:36.740 --> 53:39.650
Yeah, queen,
that would be good, too.

53:39.700 --> 53:40.740
Yeah...

53:45.660 --> 53:47.140
SHE SIGHS HEAVILY

53:48.820 --> 53:51.930
Tell you what, seeing as it's
goodbye, shall we break a habit?

53:51.980 --> 53:53.500
What? What habit?

53:55.340 --> 53:56.570
Hug?

53:56.620 --> 53:58.570
Why not.

53:58.620 --> 53:59.980
Within reason.

54:04.580 --> 54:06.450
Come on, you're on the clock.

54:06.500 --> 54:07.820
Fair enough.

54:21.140 --> 54:22.740
Why don't you like hugging, Doctor?

54:24.380 --> 54:25.780
Never trust a hug...

54:27.260 --> 54:29.140
.. it's just a way
to hide your face.

54:33.900 --> 54:35.220
Yeah.

54:42.540 --> 54:43.820
Doctor?

54:45.380 --> 54:48.060
Travelling with you
made me feel really special.

54:51.140 --> 54:52.900
Thank you for that.

54:54.460 --> 54:56.970
Thank you for making me
feel special.

54:57.020 --> 54:59.100
Thank you for exactly the same.
