WEBVTT

00:00.160 --> 00:03.980
Ooh, check this one out! "Here lies
Damien Marrow. A fishmonger.

00:04.019 --> 00:07.070
Always had a smile on his face."
Aw, that's nice!

00:07.080 --> 00:08.910
How many are you planning to read?

00:08.949 --> 00:11.800
I dunno.
Another 80... maybe?

00:11.849 --> 00:13.470
Why, are you not enjoying it?
No.

00:13.509 --> 00:16.660
Of course not. It's incredibly
boring and creepy.

00:16.699 --> 00:18.190
I've no idea why you
wanted to come here.

00:18.199 --> 00:20.612
- I find their lives... interesting.
- Why?

00:20.652 --> 00:24.652
They're dull as shit. I couldn't
just be some smiling fishmonger.

00:24.679 --> 00:27.045
Ah, it'd be OK. You'd eat well!

00:27.050 --> 00:28.725
I don't want "OK".

00:28.812 --> 00:30.500
I want fucking great.

00:30.579 --> 00:33.649
I want to sail through a storm
and ride a white deer

00:33.689 --> 00:36.039
and have sex in the graveyard.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.805
Yeah, er...
bit disrespectful though, isn't it?

00:40.865 --> 00:42.192
And chilly.

00:42.299 --> 00:46.340
You're too safe, Marcus. You may as
well just jump in the grave now.

00:46.393 --> 00:50.365
Er... OK, well, if it's naughty grave
sex you want, let's do it.

00:50.432 --> 00:52.149
Right now.
Yeah, right.

00:52.189 --> 00:54.340
You couldn't handle it.

00:54.545 --> 00:56.369
Mmm.

01:02.253 --> 01:03.604
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.745
Plebs S03E08
The Weatherist

01:05.780 --> 01:07.725
# When in Rome

01:07.745 --> 01:10.192
# Do as the Romans do

01:13.420 --> 01:15.219
# Far from home

01:15.552 --> 01:18.644
â™ª All I got is you â™ª

01:19.239 --> 01:21.049
How can anyone be "too safe"?

01:21.090 --> 01:23.090
That's like a toilet
being too clean.

01:23.129 --> 01:25.879
I think she's gonna dump me.
Whoa, no, you'll win her round.

01:25.920 --> 01:29.466
Just give the girl a bit of danger.
I am terrible at danger, though.

01:29.609 --> 01:31.552
Maybe I'll take her on a mini-break
to Tuscany.

01:31.585 --> 01:33.229
There are some fairly hazardous
hill walks.

01:33.246 --> 01:34.740
Yeah, that might not cut it, bro.

01:34.753 --> 01:37.280
So what do I do, buy her
a pet crocodile?

01:37.319 --> 01:39.310
Push her down a well?

01:41.353 --> 01:43.173
Holy Jove, God of Thunder.

01:43.240 --> 01:45.390
What?
There's a hottie in the office!

01:45.430 --> 01:48.299
Finally! I was beginning to think
it was company policy

01:48.340 --> 01:51.120
that female staff
had to be total gorgons.

01:51.206 --> 01:53.250
Ah! Apart from Flavia, of course!

01:53.289 --> 01:55.599
Oh... Yeah, but Flavia's
senior management

01:55.640 --> 01:57.870
so that comment obviously
doesn't include her.

01:57.909 --> 01:59.670
Hey! Hi, Flavia.

01:59.710 --> 02:02.192
A bold but unconvincing
recovery, Shredder.

02:02.219 --> 02:04.599
Yeah.
You've noticed Pandora, then?

02:04.609 --> 02:07.665
Pandora?! Oh, her over there! Yeah.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.633
I can see her now. Is she new, then?

02:09.673 --> 02:13.052
Indeed, she is. The board
are planning to fast-track her.

02:13.073 --> 02:14.659
As is Stylax, I expect.

02:14.699 --> 02:17.449
Well, she's been
selected for her intelligence

02:17.453 --> 02:19.932
and good judgement, so
I can't see that happening.

02:19.992 --> 02:20.979
Oh...

02:21.052 --> 02:23.550
Gawping over, back to work!

02:27.272 --> 02:30.612
It's a step down from the palace,
but it has a certain...

02:30.652 --> 02:32.000
gritty charm.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.939
Oh! Er... what's that?

02:33.973 --> 02:37.913
- And a shitty charm.
- Yes... what are the neighbours like?

02:38.105 --> 02:39.819
Grumio, what are you like?

02:40.173 --> 02:41.699
I'm all right.
He's "all right"!

02:41.700 --> 02:44.513
Oh, right.
Well, yes... that'll do.

02:44.545 --> 02:46.406
Good. Good.

02:46.460 --> 02:49.409
Grumio, this is your
new neighbour, Strabo.

02:49.425 --> 02:51.280
Play nice, won't you?

02:59.849 --> 03:02.485
Hey, Pandora, is it? I'm Stylax.

03:02.520 --> 03:05.445
That's great. If you've got a memo,
please just pop it in my inbox.

03:05.500 --> 03:06.693
Oh, no, I don't have one of them.

03:06.705 --> 03:08.286
Just thought I'd come over
for a chat.

03:08.325 --> 03:11.490
And that's super, Stylax,
but I am currently streamlining

03:11.500 --> 03:13.599
the company's internal
communications system

03:13.626 --> 03:16.586
and learning Greek.
So now really isn't the best time.

03:16.620 --> 03:19.349
How about tonight, then?
I could help you bed in here.

03:19.389 --> 03:22.819
And thanks so much, but I've already
had a full staff induction.

03:22.860 --> 03:25.413
Tomorrow, then?
Tomorrow's basket weaving,

03:25.445 --> 03:27.120
then I'm in a conference in Rimini.

03:27.159 --> 03:30.712
Week after's chocca...
How about... April?

03:30.765 --> 03:32.349
April this year?
Uh-huh.

03:32.389 --> 03:34.460
How's your diary looking?
I don't own a diary.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.810
Perfect. Well, ping me
a couple of dates

03:36.849 --> 03:38.840
and we'll find a window.

03:40.832 --> 03:42.605
So you're going to wait until April?

03:42.652 --> 03:46.346
April, schmapril. I'll find a window
before that, you know,

03:46.379 --> 03:48.925
- hoik it open and slither in.
- Oh, how romantic

03:48.973 --> 03:51.000
Oh, give us a hand for a second,
would you, lads?

03:51.066 --> 03:53.620
The landlord's only gone and talked
some other stupid sucker

03:53.646 --> 03:56.030
into moving in here.
Oh! Go landlord!

04:02.466 --> 04:05.365
Carefully, please, precious cargo.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.592
All right, this is Strabo.

04:07.645 --> 04:09.419
Me and the big man
are helping him move in.

04:09.460 --> 04:12.300
Right... cos it looks more like
you are eating his food.

04:12.340 --> 04:14.610
All part of the service.
Sorry about this.

04:14.650 --> 04:17.279
Oh, you spicy bugger!
What is it, G man?

04:17.593 --> 04:21.620
Indian food. They call it takeaway,
cos you can take it... away.

04:21.692 --> 04:25.009
You can eat in, as well.
Honestly, the things this guy knows.

04:25.050 --> 04:26.730
Oh, cool, you've got ants!

04:26.769 --> 04:30.245
They're for my work. I call them
my assist-ants.

04:30.293 --> 04:32.220
What do you do, transport leaves?

04:32.432 --> 04:35.199
No. I'm a weatherist.

04:35.273 --> 04:38.086
My ants react to tiny changes
in the atmosphere,

04:38.120 --> 04:40.340
which I use to create a forecast.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.353
I did it for the Emperor
until recently.

04:42.406 --> 04:45.786
Wicked, what's he like?
Shorter than he looks in statues.

04:46.540 --> 04:49.100
This one is called Mark Antony.

04:49.300 --> 04:51.490
He's my most trusted barometer.

04:51.946 --> 04:53.439
At least I think this is him.

04:53.540 --> 04:55.112
Go on, then, give us a prediction.

04:55.240 --> 04:59.779
Very well. I scribbled something
on a scrap of papyrus..?

05:00.012 --> 05:03.680
Ah, yes, that's the chap.

05:03.766 --> 05:06.959
"Tomorrow is overcast
with occasional sunshine."

05:07.000 --> 05:07.904
Classic.

05:07.939 --> 05:09.939
Wendsday, a small drama

05:10.180 --> 05:12.293
followed by heavy rain
in the afternoon."

05:12.305 --> 05:14.319
Sorry. Did you just say "tremor"?

05:14.365 --> 05:17.286
"Followed by heavy rain
in the afternoon." Yes.

05:17.332 --> 05:19.045
Tremor, as in earthquake?

05:19.079 --> 05:22.653
According to Mark Antony here, it's
more of a flutter than a tremor.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.579
Perfectly safe,
but people tend to panic

05:25.620 --> 05:27.529
when you start talking
about earthquakes.

05:27.545 --> 05:29.759
Thinking they are going to die
and whatnot!

05:30.105 --> 05:32.159
So best not to spread it around.

05:33.389 --> 05:35.230
Hmm?

05:37.980 --> 05:39.952
So... there's gonna be
an earthquake tomorrow.

05:40.052 --> 05:41.680
What?! How do you know?

05:41.706 --> 05:44.159
I have it on the highest authority.
Oh, no.

05:44.199 --> 05:46.189
Please don't tell me
you've found God!

05:46.230 --> 05:47.959
Pass me some of those grapes
will you?

05:48.079 --> 05:50.745
Not God, my new neighbour.
He's a weatherist.

05:50.773 --> 05:53.129
Excuse-moi, he's a what?
A weatherist.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.360
A scientist of weather.
He used to work for the Emporer.

05:55.406 --> 05:57.870
He's legit, I promise.
Are you serious?

05:57.909 --> 05:59.759
An earthquake, here in Rome?

05:59.773 --> 06:02.540
Yeah, and maybe don't tell anyone,
might cause a bit of panic.

06:02.579 --> 06:03.552
So, what are we going to do?

06:03.692 --> 06:07.160
I guess, get some supplies in.
Drink whatever it is you're making

06:07.199 --> 06:10.870
and just embrace the danger...
and of course... each other.

06:10.910 --> 06:12.300
Is it going to be a big one?

06:12.326 --> 06:14.733
Well, he can't say for sure.
Because that would be amazing!

06:14.853 --> 06:18.329
Pretty big. Yeah, a bloody whopper.
Properly dangerous.

06:21.452 --> 06:23.110
I knew you'd win her round.

06:23.149 --> 06:26.060
It was mainly thanks to our
weird new neighbour and his ants.

06:26.100 --> 06:27.206
They're the real heroes.

06:27.240 --> 06:29.192
But, what about when the earthquake
never happens?

06:29.252 --> 06:32.072
I guess, as your girlfriend
she's used to disappointment!

06:32.372 --> 06:34.033
Oh, yeah, she's gonna be
really gutted

06:34.066 --> 06:35.612
she's not under a pile of rubble.

06:35.646 --> 06:38.180
It's all about the build up.
That's the sexy bit.

06:38.220 --> 06:40.480
That's why people bang each other
on sinking ships and stuff.

06:40.490 --> 06:42.620
Of course they don't,
it would be far too wobbly.

06:42.659 --> 06:46.733
When faced with death, people just
dump everything and hump anything.

06:47.586 --> 06:49.560
In fact... ooh!

06:49.673 --> 06:51.793
Where are you going?
Is this to do with humping?

06:51.840 --> 06:52.858
Oh, he's had a humping idea.

06:52.858 --> 06:54.372
- Tell me what it is?
- No.

06:54.766 --> 06:56.872
Bad friend! Bad person!

07:01.980 --> 07:03.120
Mmm.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.269
Here, you missed a bit.

07:07.326 --> 07:08.300
Ta.

07:10.279 --> 07:11.379
How was your meal, sirs?

07:11.406 --> 07:13.413
Cracking, thanks. Real spicy.

07:13.459 --> 07:14.680
Not too spicy, I hope?

07:14.713 --> 07:16.612
Nah, nah, nah. Nice and spicy.

07:16.639 --> 07:19.050
I tell you what, grab us two more
yellow currys, would you?

07:19.089 --> 07:19.959
Coming right up, sirs.

07:19.992 --> 07:22.860
A-a-actually, what's that red curry
they're eating over there?

07:23.019 --> 07:26.786
That is a speciality of the house.
Very, very spicy.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.865
- Oh! Give us that one this time, please.
- Good call.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.685
Oh, no, I'm sorry, but the red curry
is only for regulars.

07:32.759 --> 07:33.653
What?! Why?

07:33.706 --> 07:37.459
It's for your own safety, sir.
It requires a sturdy constitution.

07:37.505 --> 07:39.452
Sturdy constitution?
You're talking to a man

07:39.485 --> 07:41.100
who'll quite happily
eat out of a bin.

07:41.139 --> 07:43.370
And it's an honour to have you
dining with us, sir,

07:43.409 --> 07:45.040
but it will be the yellow curry.

07:45.439 --> 07:47.372
- Red curry.
- Yellow curry.

07:47.439 --> 07:49.590
- Yellow curry.
- Re-

07:50.233 --> 07:52.766
I'll send some
complimentary papadums.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.470
Salve, Pandora.

08:00.509 --> 08:03.220
Hi, Stylax. No time
for chit-chat, I'm afraid.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.365
I've got to action all of these
memos before today's budget meeting.

08:06.386 --> 08:08.985
Very much looking forward
to touching base in April, though.

08:09.052 --> 08:11.040
Oh, no, no. This isn't chit-chat,
this is work.

08:11.079 --> 08:12.485
I've got a work memo for you.

08:12.545 --> 08:14.629
Ah, OK, what am I filing it under?

08:14.670 --> 08:17.579
Er... I guess it's social, with a
hint of health and safety too.

08:17.872 --> 08:20.266
Well, let's hear it
and I'll make a call.

08:21.180 --> 08:25.293
All members of staff are cordially
invited to the copy room

08:25.326 --> 08:28.213
tomorrow afternoon...
- Yeah. That's definitely social.

08:28.245 --> 08:29.620
..cos there's gonna be
an earthquake.

08:29.685 --> 08:32.625
Oh! Wow! Gosh! I see.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.659
That is more health and safety now.
Yeah.

08:34.700 --> 08:37.250
Come and hunker down...
"Hunker down..."

08:37.289 --> 08:39.893
..in a safe, but fun, environment.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.639
Wear loose clothing.

08:42.852 --> 08:44.773
I'll get that off right away.
Great.

08:44.799 --> 08:46.779
Oh, and of course, do make sure
you come along.

08:46.820 --> 08:48.753
Erm... that's going
to be tough, Stylax,

08:48.779 --> 08:50.806
because I'm really getting slammed
here with work.

08:50.879 --> 08:53.480
Bring it with you. Treat my desk
as a hot desk.

08:53.519 --> 08:56.110
Is it a hot desk?
It would be if you were at it.

08:56.149 --> 08:58.149
Huh?

09:01.365 --> 09:03.090
Just get on the cart, Delphine.

09:03.129 --> 09:04.919
No, I'm not going anywhere.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.206
Hey, everything all right?

09:06.232 --> 09:07.913
Can you talk to her, please?

09:07.926 --> 09:11.820
She's refusing to leave and there's
gonna be a bloody big earthquake!

09:14.346 --> 09:17.725
I did say not to tell anyone.
I only told Maya...

09:19.046 --> 09:20.710
..and the other guys on the cart...

09:20.750 --> 09:22.750
Delphine?
..and Gregory.

09:22.789 --> 09:24.299
Ah, you told your ex!

09:29.480 --> 09:32.245
I am not on my own,
I am with Marcus.

09:32.312 --> 09:35.860
Marcus? This guy, Marcus?
He's staying for the earthquake?

09:35.885 --> 09:39.320
Oh, I can't wait! I am
all about the earthquake.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.570
If it's too real for you,

09:40.610 --> 09:43.120
by all means, scamper off
out of here... Greg.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.269
You are really staying with him?

09:50.419 --> 09:53.179
OK. Safe trip, then. Off you pop.

09:53.253 --> 09:55.240
- Bon voyage.
- Hey, on.

09:56.789 --> 09:58.830
They are so pathetic.
Well,

09:59.145 --> 10:01.779
these things really separate
the men from the boys, don't they?

10:01.820 --> 10:05.129
And on the plus side, we've got
the whole place to ourselves.

10:13.879 --> 10:15.690
Hey, Strabo.

10:15.730 --> 10:17.730
Terrific forecast, earlier.

10:17.769 --> 10:19.519
Please pass on my thanks
to the ants.

10:19.559 --> 10:22.309
Yes, will do.
Are you going somewhere?

10:22.350 --> 10:24.460
Mm... I thought I'd go and stay
with my sister.

10:24.500 --> 10:28.289
Yes, my reading for tomorrow's
changed somewhat, you see?

10:28.330 --> 10:30.639
Oh, right. What's going on?
There is still a tremor?

10:30.679 --> 10:33.889
Oh, yes, but it may be a bit bigger.
Bigger?

10:33.899 --> 10:34.820
How much bigger?

10:34.830 --> 10:38.625
Well, I checked with the ants and
they were quite, well... antsy.

10:38.673 --> 10:40.850
They are now suggesting
a full-blown earthquake...

10:40.889 --> 10:42.519
but I'm sure
it will be fine, though.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.399
What? No, you're not.
You're gonna stay with your sister.

10:45.692 --> 10:47.429
Yes, that is true.

10:47.799 --> 10:51.159
The ants can be wrong, of course.
So it could be nothing, then?

10:51.200 --> 10:53.206
Oh, absolutely. It could be nothing.

11:00.832 --> 11:01.893
Excuse me.

11:05.232 --> 11:08.232
You're completely overreacting,
the guy's a gibbering looney.

11:08.285 --> 11:10.509
- He's a respected weatherist...
- Who talks to ants!

11:10.549 --> 11:11.529
He knows his stuff.

11:11.539 --> 11:14.306
Yesterday, he said it would be
overcast with sunny spells.

11:14.360 --> 11:18.212
- And Io...it was!
- That's not Io, that's default forecast.

11:18.225 --> 11:20.346
He could have just said,
"There'll be weather".

11:20.385 --> 11:24.000
I trust him. He said curry
were nice and it is... very nice.

11:24.039 --> 11:26.120
I wouldn't be surprised if there's
a monster quake on the way.

11:26.159 --> 11:28.245
Oh... so presumably you'll
wanna get out of town, then.

11:28.306 --> 11:31.706
Nah, sounds like a right faff.
Uh-huh? What about you, then?

11:31.765 --> 11:33.812
Oh, no, I've got to hunker down
with Pandora.

11:33.852 --> 11:36.600
This might be the only time
she can... slot me in.

11:36.665 --> 11:39.200
I figured you might prioritise
slotting yourself in over survival.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.500
Well, at least I'll die happy, Marcus.

11:41.519 --> 11:43.279
- Come on, we're gonna be late for work.
- What?!

11:43.312 --> 11:45.840
I'm not going to work.
There's gonna be an earthquake!

11:45.885 --> 11:47.370
Whatever!
See you tonight, then.

11:47.409 --> 11:51.100
I sincerely hope so.
Yeah, I'll see you tonight!

11:53.000 --> 11:59.074

12:03.686 --> 12:04.700
Morning, Shredder.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.460
Oh, hey. Where is everyone?

12:06.500 --> 12:08.529
Good question. No-one seems
to have shown up.

12:08.570 --> 12:10.200
That's weird.
Isn't it?

12:10.240 --> 12:13.059
One wonders if it has anything to do
with the memo you sent yesterday

12:13.110 --> 12:15.086
informing them there'd be
an earthquake?

12:15.120 --> 12:19.024
Well, no, that was meant as an
invitation, not a out-vitation.

12:19.025 --> 12:22.066
Well, your out-vitation has lost me
my whole staff.

12:22.090 --> 12:23.179
Not your whole staff!
No.

12:23.320 --> 12:26.320
No, a few of the keenest beans
and saddest sacks

12:26.360 --> 12:27.580
have decided to brave it.

12:27.620 --> 12:30.019
Morning, guys.
Oh, great! Hey, morning, Pandora.

12:30.059 --> 12:31.269
So sorry that I'm late,

12:31.286 --> 12:33.840
but I've been at a breakfasting
network event.

12:33.879 --> 12:37.232
Have a terrific day.
Yeah, let's really make it count.

12:37.686 --> 12:40.750
I hope for your sake there's a
catastrophic earthquake, Shredder,

12:40.779 --> 12:43.419
or you are so fired!

12:43.840 --> 12:45.840
OK. Fingers crossed.

12:48.546 --> 12:50.149
What can I get you, gentlemen?

12:50.190 --> 12:52.980
And I'm afraid I still won't be able
to serve you the red curry.

12:53.019 --> 12:55.009
Yeah, that's fine,
we're not hungry today.

12:55.049 --> 12:58.159
We just thought we'd come by to
let you know about the earthquake.

12:59.265 --> 13:00.100
The what?

13:00.186 --> 13:03.265
Any minute now. Gonna squash
the lot, apparently.

13:05.033 --> 13:06.500
Here they come.

13:06.732 --> 13:08.905
We are in bloody business here.

13:15.110 --> 13:17.100
Move it!

13:17.946 --> 13:19.505
This is so annoying.

13:19.539 --> 13:23.740
- We still need candles, rope, bandages.
- Bandages?

13:23.750 --> 13:26.145
Definitely?
And everyone's closing!

13:26.173 --> 13:27.269
Look!

13:27.472 --> 13:31.679
Hey, I was thinking, why don't we
do something crazy and spontaneous?

13:31.720 --> 13:33.552
Sure, OK, great. Like what?

13:33.566 --> 13:36.653
Like, I dunno... go to Tuscany
for a mini-break?

13:36.673 --> 13:39.452
It doesn't sound that crazy.
But it would be spontaneous...

13:39.490 --> 13:42.480
if we go now, jump in a cart
and just head for the hills!

13:42.519 --> 13:46.046
But then we'd miss the earthquake?
Oh, yeah, I guess we would!

13:46.092 --> 13:48.352
And you are all about
the earthquake, right?

13:48.393 --> 13:49.732
Yeah, course.

13:49.820 --> 13:52.090
I'd just rather be all about it
from Tuscany.

13:52.129 --> 13:54.759
We can go afterwards if we
are still up for it, then.

13:54.773 --> 13:56.950
And I guess... alive?

13:57.620 --> 13:59.389
I'll pick up the bandages
and the rope.

13:59.613 --> 14:01.605
You go and get some candles
from your place.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.039
And then we'll meet back at mine.

14:03.092 --> 14:07.039
And hurry... this could be
a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.909
Yeah, I know.

14:09.909 --> 14:11.710
It could well be.

14:17.980 --> 14:19.639
Where are you, you red bastard?

14:21.120 --> 14:23.200
Bingo.
Are you sure?

14:23.265 --> 14:25.340
Oh, yeah. Nearly took my schnozz off!

14:25.379 --> 14:26.779
Mmm.

14:27.052 --> 14:31.586
Oh, praise Jupiter... and of course,
the Indian God of lovely grub.

14:31.645 --> 14:33.159
Amen.

14:37.326 --> 14:38.820
Haw... haw... haw.

14:38.860 --> 14:40.809
Is it hot?

14:40.850 --> 14:42.879
Hot... hot.

14:43.580 --> 14:45.100
Norks alive!

14:45.165 --> 14:48.605
I don't think I can take it.
Don't let it beat you, big boy.

14:48.653 --> 14:51.860
Come on, chew through the pain!
Ow! Ooh, mamma!

14:51.932 --> 14:54.379
Ooh, mamma. Mamma.

15:01.105 --> 15:03.253
It's only Marcus!
All right, landlord.

15:03.312 --> 15:05.090
Got any plans for this "earthquake"?

15:05.129 --> 15:06.600
Yeah, I think I might die in it.

15:06.653 --> 15:08.960
Oh, fair do's.
I'm getting out of here.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.245
Between you and me, I built
this place on the cheap.

15:12.273 --> 15:15.466
No, what a surprise
A fruity fart could blow it down.

15:15.500 --> 15:18.409
Right, well... make sure they put
something appropriate on my grave.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.686
Like, "Here lies
a fucking bell-end."

15:20.745 --> 15:23.559
No problem. Oh, you've not
seen Davus, have you?

15:23.666 --> 15:25.580
I saved him a seat
in the cart.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.405
No. I suppose you'll have to go
without the big bozo.

15:28.432 --> 15:29.970
You don't want it, do you?

15:30.826 --> 15:32.765
25 dinari each way.

15:32.799 --> 15:36.326
50 for priority boarding
or any luggage over three kilos.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.773
Sorry, I had to squeeze one out.

15:38.826 --> 15:40.700
I don't like shitting by the road.

15:40.725 --> 15:42.993
Course not, you're a lady.

15:43.846 --> 15:45.720
Are you coming, then?

15:51.385 --> 15:52.820
Thanks so much for coming.

15:53.046 --> 15:54.566
Do you want to take off
your coat, maybe?

15:54.639 --> 15:57.926
Er... I won't. I'm just putting in
face time, can't hunker long.

15:57.966 --> 16:00.860
Of course. Would you like a glass
of water while you're here?

16:00.893 --> 16:02.059
Thank you, I would.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.832
Aurelius?
I'm not helping you out, mate.

16:04.893 --> 16:06.566
Come on, it's your job.

16:06.832 --> 16:08.139
OK, but only for her.

16:08.179 --> 16:12.253
So what's the gameplan here?
I guess we just hunker and wait.

16:12.279 --> 16:13.385
Ah, because I should flag up

16:13.426 --> 16:16.225
that I do have a basket weaving
class starting imminently.

16:16.253 --> 16:17.970
Yeah, it should be here any sec.

16:20.639 --> 16:23.192
Er... have you been in any other
natural disasters?

16:23.232 --> 16:25.092
Erm...let me think...

16:25.200 --> 16:27.100
not a disaster as such,

16:27.139 --> 16:29.926
but we were snowed in
when I was a child and...

16:29.946 --> 16:31.950
We couldn't open the door
because of all the snow.

16:31.990 --> 16:35.245
- Wow. So what happened?
- It melted, presumably.

16:35.265 --> 16:36.929
Er... stay out of this, please.

16:37.173 --> 16:39.519
Did it?
It did, yes.

16:40.159 --> 16:42.580
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to
duck out now, guys.

16:42.605 --> 16:45.192
Wait... I think I can feel it coming!

16:45.332 --> 16:47.139
Holy Jove, can you feel it?

16:47.192 --> 16:47.893
No.

16:47.894 --> 16:50.513
Yeah, I'm really not getting
any vibes on this one.

16:50.539 --> 16:53.980
Look, forget basket weaving.
I can't. We're doing handles today.

16:54.005 --> 16:56.485
There's an earthquake coming!
And I wish the timing was better

16:56.505 --> 16:58.740
but I really can't
squeeze it in right now.

16:58.779 --> 17:00.769
Thanks again for the water.

17:20.759 --> 17:22.579
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh...

17:22.618 --> 17:24.380
Hot!

17:24.420 --> 17:26.410
Oh!

17:28.553 --> 17:29.506
Did you hear that?

17:29.539 --> 17:31.750
I can't hear shit,
all my senses are numb.

17:31.789 --> 17:33.589
There was a rumble.
Probably my tummy.

17:33.732 --> 17:36.099
No, no. It was bigger than that.
Your tummy?

17:36.140 --> 17:37.579
I think it was the earthquake.

17:37.653 --> 17:39.809
Hmm... sweet.

17:42.039 --> 17:43.925
Ah, bollocks.

17:44.113 --> 17:46.032
I'd better go and find
the wife and kid really.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.826
My missus will be well angry
if she dies and I'm not there.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.653
Right... I reckon I'll press on.

17:50.712 --> 17:53.579
Well, have a good quake.
Better catch you, big lad.

17:55.726 --> 17:56.789
Hot!

18:00.480 --> 18:01.700
Shredder?

18:02.740 --> 18:04.432
You're still here, I see.

18:04.509 --> 18:06.885
Well, you know, I take my job
very seriously.

18:06.913 --> 18:09.292
Yes, of course.
Hence inventing an earthquake

18:09.319 --> 18:12.006
in order to lure co-workers
to a panicky fuck-fest!

18:12.086 --> 18:13.692
I didn't invent it, exactly.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.605
No? Then where did this rumour
of yours come from?

18:16.685 --> 18:18.480
And make this good
or you will lose your job.

18:18.526 --> 18:21.730
Well, my neighbour's got these ants
that know the future.

18:21.769 --> 18:23.569
And you're fired!
Here is your contract,

18:23.609 --> 18:26.079
if you'd like to perform
your final act of shredding.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.109
I...

18:31.299 --> 18:33.210
Ants indeed!

18:33.250 --> 18:35.450
I've never heard anything
so preposterous.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.759
Yeah, I know! The guy's a crackpot!

18:37.799 --> 18:40.869
I think I might hunker down here,
just in case.

18:41.220 --> 18:42.980
Mmm... I think I might join you.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.240
Here it comes. Brace yourselves.

19:05.566 --> 19:06.730
God!
Whoa!

19:06.740 --> 19:09.766
Urgh! Get off me, you pervert.

19:12.809 --> 19:13.799
You all right, Mum?

19:13.819 --> 19:16.829
Huh! This beaky bastard
tried to molest me.

19:16.869 --> 19:18.869
I didn't.
It was the quake, it...

19:19.252 --> 19:20.380
Hang on, has it finished?

19:20.413 --> 19:23.329
Yeah. I'll turn her around.

19:23.369 --> 19:25.359
That was the earthquake?

19:25.400 --> 19:27.640
What a load of rubbish.

19:30.573 --> 19:33.519
Back we go. No refunds.

19:39.692 --> 19:41.726
I expected that to last longer.

19:41.766 --> 19:42.952
Sorry, it usually does.

19:43.019 --> 19:46.026
I meant the earthquake!
Oh, yeah, of course.

19:46.220 --> 19:47.529
Thought it would be bigger.

19:47.569 --> 19:49.046
Erm... the earthquake again?

19:49.066 --> 19:51.685
Yes. Although the earth
didn't really move

19:51.700 --> 19:53.950
in either regard,
to be honest, Shredder.

19:57.333 --> 19:59.605
So not like that
was payment or anything,

19:59.645 --> 20:01.553
but could I have
my job back now, please?

20:01.579 --> 20:02.432
- You may...
- Yes!

20:02.433 --> 20:04.712
...provided you never breathe
a word of this to anyone

20:04.732 --> 20:05.792
as long as you live.

20:05.859 --> 20:08.846
Oh, yeah, obviously.
What?! What do you mean, obviously?

20:08.873 --> 20:10.819
Oh, nothing, I just...

20:10.980 --> 20:13.766
my lips are sealed. Good.
Now get out!

20:14.119 --> 20:16.049
Same time next earthquake?
Out!

20:16.086 --> 20:17.589
OK, yeah

20:27.880 --> 20:29.553
Hey. So sorry.

20:29.566 --> 20:31.349
It took ages to find my candles.

20:31.390 --> 20:34.826
And then I got trapped
under a sort of... beam!

20:34.865 --> 20:38.313
Uh-huh? Was it before or after
you got a lift out of town?

20:38.353 --> 20:40.559
I... Sorry, what?

20:40.593 --> 20:43.726
I saw you in the cart.
You sneaky little rat.

20:43.779 --> 20:45.972
Um... Right.

20:46.059 --> 20:47.865
What's that shit on your tunic?

20:47.920 --> 20:50.752
Er... it's supposed to be rubble.

20:50.813 --> 20:53.859
Hey, Marcus.
What's he doing here?

20:53.900 --> 20:55.326
And also in a towel?

20:55.373 --> 20:58.119
Where were you, man?
You missed our little party.

20:58.165 --> 21:00.232
What? Did you..?

21:00.640 --> 21:01.425
With him?

21:01.480 --> 21:04.653
There was an earthquake. We thought
we were going to die.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.492
And you were supposed to be out
of town, you Gallic git.

21:07.526 --> 21:08.869
I came back.

21:08.910 --> 21:11.700
It's times like this where you
realise who you care about most.

21:15.880 --> 21:18.952
She wasn't the Gaul for you.
I've always said that.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.486
You like mini-breaks,
she likes earthquakes.

21:21.566 --> 21:23.486
Yeah... how was the office, then?

21:23.519 --> 21:25.212
Did you manage to "hunker down"?

21:25.259 --> 21:27.752
Uh-huh. Yeah, it wasn't quite
what I had in mind,

21:27.772 --> 21:29.400
but I did do some hunkering.

21:29.465 --> 21:32.049
Well, at least things worked out
for one of us.

21:32.089 --> 21:34.089
Er...
Hey up? Look who it is?

21:34.130 --> 21:36.440
Oi! So much for
your giant earthquake.

21:36.665 --> 21:38.266
Oh, yes, I know.

21:38.286 --> 21:40.766
The ants pass on their
profound apologies.

21:40.786 --> 21:44.413
Some of their predictions
are built on shaky ground,

21:44.425 --> 21:45.819
as it were.

21:45.873 --> 21:50.880
Oh, look, it's starting to rain!
They did get one thing right.

21:51.869 --> 21:54.700
Yeah, great, because things weren't
shit enough already!

21:54.740 --> 21:58.932
Hey up, that's not rain, mate.
That's snow!

21:58.986 --> 22:00.480
Yes!
Ha!

22:00.519 --> 22:03.819
It's snowing!
See... things couldn't be any better.

22:05.346 --> 22:06.700
Hey!

22:16.726 --> 22:18.099
Boom!

22:19.900 --> 22:21.490
All right. Er... Grumio!
