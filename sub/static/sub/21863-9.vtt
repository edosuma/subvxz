WEBVTT

00:03.203 --> 00:04.601
Found my favorite.

00:04.704 --> 00:06.398
Black Jesus on skis.

00:06.468 --> 00:08.372
Why not? You go, brother.

00:08.474 --> 00:10.207
I'm partial to
the more traditional ornaments.

00:10.309 --> 00:11.809
Black Jesus reading the Bible.

00:11.910 --> 00:14.316
Baby Black Jesus on a walnut!

00:14.386 --> 00:17.004
Ho ho... No!

00:17.105 --> 00:18.725
We missed all the decorating.

00:18.827 --> 00:20.827
Don't worry.
We haven't put the star up yet.

00:20.943 --> 00:22.562
Which means we also
haven't heard Jermaine's joke

00:22.664 --> 00:24.197
where he says that he's the star.

00:24.299 --> 00:25.364
I can't do it now.

00:25.466 --> 00:27.400
So, who's gonna put me
on top of the tree?

00:27.502 --> 00:29.502
Where <i> is</i> the star? I just had it.

00:29.604 --> 00:30.903
Well, you know, it seems to me

00:31.005 --> 00:33.072
that whoever finds the star

00:33.174 --> 00:36.175
should be the one to hang it up
on the tree, right?

00:36.277 --> 00:37.376
Where's the star, T.K.?

00:37.478 --> 00:39.077
Why does Courtney get the honor
every year?

00:39.179 --> 00:40.278
Most families rotate

00:40.380 --> 00:42.614
so that none of the children
feel neglected.

00:42.716 --> 00:44.516
You're not my child.

00:44.618 --> 00:47.011
You're not <i> a</i> child.
Let's get this star on.

00:47.065 --> 00:48.086
- Okay, I'm gonna give you a boost.
- Here we go.

00:48.172 --> 00:49.502
- We ready?
- All right, Ma. Careful, now.

00:49.526 --> 00:51.256
Don't go too fast. Going too fast!

00:51.358 --> 00:52.790
Whoa! Whoa!

00:52.892 --> 00:55.059
Oh!

00:55.161 --> 00:57.661
Okay, that was not
a reflection of my boost.

00:57.763 --> 00:58.862
My boost was solid.

00:58.964 --> 01:00.364
All right. Can we wrap this up?

01:00.466 --> 01:03.601
I got a little Hanukkah thing
I got to get to.

01:06.930 --> 01:09.339

01:13.545 --> 01:17.380
"But I heard him exclaim
'ere he drove out of sight,

01:17.482 --> 01:21.817
'Happy Christmas to all,
and to all a good night.'"

01:24.389 --> 01:25.888
Thank you again, Mayor Rose.

01:25.990 --> 01:27.557
Would you care to stay for some dinner?

01:27.659 --> 01:28.591
We're having pizza.

01:28.693 --> 01:30.225
I'm sorry. Pizza... that... that's all?

01:30.327 --> 01:32.060
When my mom used to bring me here,

01:32.162 --> 01:33.762
I would help serve turkey,
green beans...

01:33.864 --> 01:34.929
you know, the works.

01:35.031 --> 01:36.265
There was even a tree... a <i> real</i> tree...

01:36.367 --> 01:37.266
and kids got presents.

01:37.368 --> 01:38.900
Oh, we got presents.

01:39.002 --> 01:42.904
Some local dentists donated
over 200 toothbrushes.

01:43.006 --> 01:45.940
- Useful gifts are so underrated.
- I'm sorry.

01:46.042 --> 01:47.308
Are you telling me that these families

01:47.410 --> 01:48.876
are celebrating Christmas
under a plastic tree

01:48.978 --> 01:49.943
with pizza and toothbrushes?

01:50.045 --> 01:51.312
It's been a very hard year.

01:51.414 --> 01:52.680
We lost our federal funding,

01:52.782 --> 01:54.782
and we have more families
to support than ever.

01:54.884 --> 01:56.116
You see them? The Baxters.

01:56.218 --> 01:58.252
Husband got laid off,
fell behind on their rent,

01:58.354 --> 01:59.587
and got evicted.

01:59.689 --> 02:01.289
That's the type of family
we didn't have last year.

02:01.442 --> 02:02.321
Wow.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.021
I didn't realize

02:04.123 --> 02:06.324
things had gotten
that much worse in a year.

02:06.426 --> 02:09.158
Mm-hmm.

02:09.261 --> 02:11.128
Hey! Everybody!

02:11.230 --> 02:12.129
- Courtney.
- Hey!

02:12.231 --> 02:13.397
Mayor Rose...

02:13.499 --> 02:14.665
you are not about to overpromise
right now, are you?

02:14.767 --> 02:15.733
Oh, you don't even know.

02:15.835 --> 02:19.403
Ah, people, I was raised to believe

02:19.505 --> 02:22.339
that every family deserves
to have a great Christmas.

02:22.441 --> 02:25.241
A dinner, presents, a real tree.

02:25.344 --> 02:26.976
- That tree sucks!
- Yes, it does!

02:27.078 --> 02:28.911
So, friends, as Mayor of Fort Grey,

02:29.013 --> 02:32.248
I hereby pledge
to give every family in here

02:32.351 --> 02:34.551
a Christmas you'll never forget.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.086
No time for questions.

02:37.188 --> 02:38.520
I'm here all day!

02:38.622 --> 02:40.956
Big news...
I promised the shelter residents

02:41.058 --> 02:41.990
a real Christmas.

02:42.092 --> 02:43.425
Also, Val's mad at me.

02:43.527 --> 02:45.761
Classic Courtney overpromise. I love it!

02:45.863 --> 02:46.795
I'm not mad, Courtney.

02:46.897 --> 02:48.163
I-I think it was a great thing to say.

02:48.265 --> 02:50.999
Wait. F-For real?

02:51.101 --> 02:52.568
Be careful. This could be
one of her word traps.

02:52.670 --> 02:53.935
For real.

02:54.037 --> 02:56.671
I... Wasn't it Gandhi who said
a society can be judged

02:56.773 --> 02:59.073
on how it treats
its most vulnerable citizens?

02:59.175 --> 03:01.141
Ah, yes, yes,
and somebody else said that...

03:01.244 --> 03:02.610
that's basically what I said.

03:02.712 --> 03:03.878
I love what you're trying to do,

03:03.980 --> 03:05.346
but the shelter feeds over 300 families

03:05.448 --> 03:06.581
and the city can't afford that.

03:06.683 --> 03:07.882
Hey, look, Val.

03:07.984 --> 03:09.216
I know it seems impossible,

03:09.318 --> 03:11.729
but isn't it my job as mayor
to at least try?

03:11.784 --> 03:12.853
Hey!

03:12.954 --> 03:14.888
Also, I'm gonna need your ideas
to help do that.

03:14.990 --> 03:16.018
Yep. Chop-chop.

03:16.058 --> 03:17.681
It's 4:00 p.m. on Christmas
Eve, so good luck.

03:17.706 --> 03:18.706
- Yeah.
- Well,

03:18.753 --> 03:22.028
w-we've already drained
the entire 2017 budget.

03:23.532 --> 03:26.433
This idea is a little naughty.

03:26.535 --> 03:28.734
- I doubt that.
- You think it's naughty?

03:28.836 --> 03:31.604
We could get an advance
on the 2018 budget,

03:31.706 --> 03:33.773
just to get Christmas going.

03:34.542 --> 03:36.542
Sounded a little naughtier in my head.

03:36.644 --> 03:37.743
- Yeah.
- But we would need

03:37.845 --> 03:39.578
official sign-off
from two people. First, you.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.146
Oh, you already know
I am easily persuaded.

03:41.171 --> 03:42.147
Who else?

03:43.418 --> 03:45.583
Who is it?

03:45.685 --> 03:48.887
Oh, it's you guys. Go away.

03:48.988 --> 03:51.155
Wow. Drinking in your office
on Christmas Eve?

03:51.257 --> 03:52.657
That's lonely, even for you.

03:52.759 --> 03:54.258
Well, if you must know,
I promised my family

03:54.360 --> 03:56.761
a ski trip to Mammoth,
but I can't afford it.

03:56.863 --> 03:58.430
So they're home all packed, and...

03:58.532 --> 03:59.764
I haven't told 'em yet.

03:59.866 --> 04:01.900
So, is your plan just
to hide out in here forever?

04:02.001 --> 04:03.199
No, I need an excuse,

04:03.302 --> 04:04.902
so I'm gonna drink until I think of one.

04:04.970 --> 04:06.970
Well, you know, we would love
to stick around and brainstorm,

04:07.039 --> 04:09.907
but we need your signature
to release the 2018 budget

04:09.975 --> 04:11.608
to help the homeless.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.444
You know what? That's a great idea.

04:13.512 --> 04:15.579
I can say I got stabbed
by a homeless person,

04:15.648 --> 04:17.012
and now I can't go skiing.

04:17.115 --> 04:18.214
Thank you.

04:18.283 --> 04:19.916
Get a hold of yourself, man.

04:19.983 --> 04:22.318
Ed, just sign the paper,
and we'll leave you alone.

04:22.386 --> 04:25.287
Oh, if I could just get my wife to
say those words.

04:25.356 --> 04:27.289
Look, the city's already
borrowed against the budget.

04:27.358 --> 04:28.357
You know this.

04:28.426 --> 04:29.725
Fort Grey does not have a slush fund.

04:29.794 --> 04:31.226
If they did, I'd be skiing right now.

04:31.295 --> 04:33.359
Come on, man. It is the holidays, okay?

04:33.417 --> 04:34.616
There must be something we can do.

04:34.702 --> 04:36.798
I just gave a huge speech.
It was real charismatic.

04:36.900 --> 04:38.032
Here's an idea...

04:38.134 --> 04:39.768
maybe you should have thought
of this three months ago.

04:39.837 --> 04:40.969
But you didn't.

04:41.071 --> 04:42.270
And that's not surprising,

04:42.372 --> 04:44.573
because you really haven't
done much as the mayor.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.007
No, no, no, no. That's not true.

04:46.076 --> 04:47.676
We, uh... We... We solved a bus strike.

04:47.744 --> 04:49.845
- We got music in schools.
- Met a lady.

04:49.947 --> 04:52.113
That's all very cute,
but what about jobs?

04:52.182 --> 04:53.881
What about housing?
What about all those potholes?

04:53.950 --> 04:55.716
Something that makes
an actual difference.

04:55.818 --> 04:57.985
Gunt, c'mon, man. This is for families.

04:58.087 --> 04:59.052
It's Christmas.

04:59.121 --> 05:00.020
"It's Christmas."

05:00.089 --> 05:01.054
I know.

05:01.156 --> 05:02.623
Where did I put all my fuzzy feelings?

05:02.725 --> 05:04.859
Forget it, man.

05:04.961 --> 05:06.226
You're not leaving, are you?

05:06.328 --> 05:08.195
Door's always closed, guys.

05:08.297 --> 05:10.330
Gunt. Gunt.

05:10.432 --> 05:13.065
- He's a jerk... I know.
- No! He's right!

05:13.167 --> 05:14.868
Did you hear what that volunteer said?

05:14.936 --> 05:16.335
This year was worse than ever.

05:16.404 --> 05:18.137
The people of Fort Grey need jobs,

05:18.206 --> 05:20.940
and I'm the mayor who put
plastic covers over benches.

05:21.042 --> 05:23.075
I shoulda just stayed in my lane
and been a famous rapper,

05:23.144 --> 05:24.644
then Fort Grey would've been better off.

05:24.713 --> 05:26.813
Is anyone gonna touch that?

05:26.915 --> 05:28.413
Courtney, change is slow.

05:28.516 --> 05:30.248
Fort Grey has no money,
just a lot of red tape

05:30.350 --> 05:31.717
and a bitter City Council President.

05:31.819 --> 05:33.151
You're being too hard on yourself.

05:33.253 --> 05:36.488
Or am I finally being hard enough?

05:38.025 --> 05:39.791
- What?
- I'll see you guys later.

05:39.894 --> 05:41.359
Why does he ask a question

05:41.461 --> 05:42.995
if he's not gonna stay around
for the answer?

05:43.063 --> 05:45.295
I mean, I don't always have one,
but I like to hear myself talk...

05:45.364 --> 05:47.732
you know, find it, go on
that journey to discovery.

05:47.834 --> 05:50.019
Let's see what's
on the World Wide Webby,

05:50.120 --> 05:52.236
the old Dub-dub-dub.

05:52.338 --> 05:54.405
This is a garbage planet.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:04.416 --> 06:05.582
Ohh! Oh!

06:05.651 --> 06:07.651
Of course! A pothole. Come on.

06:07.753 --> 06:09.452
Ohh, really?

06:11.924 --> 06:13.023
Oh!

06:13.124 --> 06:15.058
Oh! Aah!

06:32.777 --> 06:35.910
Mm.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.582
Where are my covered bus benches?

06:53.261 --> 06:55.428
Oh, uh, perfect timing.

06:55.530 --> 06:57.598
I got stuck in the rain.
You are an angel.

06:57.700 --> 07:00.100
- That's right. I am.
- Whoa!

07:00.202 --> 07:01.501
You really went all out

07:01.570 --> 07:03.870
with the Christmas decorations
this year, huh?

07:03.939 --> 07:07.107
I didn't know the post office
made white uniforms.

07:07.209 --> 07:08.475
It's a bold choice, Ma.

07:08.543 --> 07:10.776
Like I told you,
I'm not your ma. I'm an angel.

07:10.845 --> 07:13.178
Angel 467 with
the Department of Salvation.

07:13.247 --> 07:14.847
I specialize in epiphanies.

07:14.949 --> 07:16.316
In fact, one more, and I get to choose

07:16.341 --> 07:17.707
where we have our retreat next year.

07:18.321 --> 07:19.919
Okay, that is...

07:20.021 --> 07:22.088
that's a really good prank,
very specific.

07:22.189 --> 07:23.255
This ain't a prank.

07:23.357 --> 07:25.091
I'm here to show you
what Fort Grey would look like

07:25.192 --> 07:26.758
if you were never elected mayor.

07:26.860 --> 07:29.260
Oh, so you don't believe me?

07:29.362 --> 07:31.496
Oh, well, let me show you
what your city look like.

07:35.368 --> 07:37.502
Whoa!

07:37.604 --> 07:39.104
Seriously?

07:39.205 --> 07:41.072
I mean, all of that is because
I wasn't elected mayor?

07:41.174 --> 07:43.341
Well, it's not that bad. But it <i> is</i> bad.

07:43.443 --> 07:45.575
Hold on tight. I got a lot to show you.

07:52.054 --> 07:54.561
Take a hike! We're on strike!

07:54.585 --> 07:55.592
Take a hike...

07:55.593 --> 07:57.427
But I thought the bus strike
ended months ago.

07:57.491 --> 07:58.523
Not in this world, it didn't.

07:58.618 --> 08:00.018
- Oh, so you're not gonna change?
- Mm.

08:00.086 --> 08:02.353
In this world, does everyone dress
like a waiter from "Star Trek"?

08:02.422 --> 08:04.455
No one can see me.
They can only see you. Watch.

08:04.557 --> 08:06.390
- Take a hike,
- Aah!

08:06.458 --> 08:07.601
we're on strike!

08:07.695 --> 08:08.725
Oh!

08:08.827 --> 08:10.093
Isn't it fun?

08:10.162 --> 08:11.395
Now, stop wasting time.

08:11.497 --> 08:12.762
We got a packed schedule.

08:12.864 --> 08:14.564
Sir, I am... I am so sorry.

08:14.666 --> 08:16.299
Hey, I thought angels
were supposed to be nice.

08:16.368 --> 08:18.502
Yes, but that dude is horrible.
I can't even tell you about it.

08:18.603 --> 08:19.569
Take a hike!

08:19.671 --> 08:22.238
Hey!

08:23.508 --> 08:25.474
Oh. What's... What's up with Pam?

08:25.543 --> 08:26.742
She doesn't know you.

08:26.777 --> 08:28.744
Remember, in this world,
you <i> lost</i> the election.

08:28.812 --> 08:31.780
Wait. If I lost the election,
then who's mayor?

08:31.849 --> 08:33.082
Mm.

08:33.148 --> 08:34.629
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

08:34.655 --> 08:35.592
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

08:35.633 --> 08:37.400
No. Anyone but...

08:37.501 --> 08:38.741
If you repeat it over and over,
they'll believe you.

08:38.820 --> 08:40.969
Gunt.

08:41.037 --> 08:42.971
- Okay.
- What did he do to my office?

08:43.039 --> 08:45.240
Oh, he, uh, he decorated it.

08:45.342 --> 08:48.009
I like to call this style
"modern bordello."

08:48.112 --> 08:50.312
Just squash the measure.

08:50.380 --> 08:52.247
No, there won't be a public outcry

08:52.349 --> 08:54.749
because we're gonna vote
in a closed session.

08:54.818 --> 08:56.617
All right, bye-bye.

08:56.685 --> 09:00.254
Hey. You're a bit early for my massage.
What... is Julio sick?

09:00.356 --> 09:01.755
I'm not... I'm not a masseuse.

09:01.857 --> 09:03.591
I'm Courtney Rose. I ran against you.

09:03.659 --> 09:05.792
Are you the publicity-stunt kid?

09:05.894 --> 09:08.129
Oh, wow. That's hilarious.

09:08.197 --> 09:10.297
Look at you. What... do you need a job?

09:10.366 --> 09:11.732
You know what? I'm a good guy.

09:11.800 --> 09:12.766
I'm not the devil.

09:12.868 --> 09:14.934
I'll help an old rival
fallen on hard times.

09:15.003 --> 09:16.436
We need a bathroom attendant.

09:16.538 --> 09:18.404
Ah.

09:18.473 --> 09:20.072
How did you hurt your foot?

09:20.142 --> 09:21.841
Ah, skiing in stupid Mammoth.

09:21.943 --> 09:23.443
Horrible trip.

09:23.545 --> 09:25.178
Free advice... never have a family.

09:25.313 --> 09:26.779
Wait, I thought you couldn't
afford to go to Mammoth.

09:26.881 --> 09:29.015
Well, if you're the mayor,
you can afford a lot of things.

09:29.083 --> 09:30.449
You just got to work the system a bit.

09:31.519 --> 09:33.318
You made a slush fund?

09:33.420 --> 09:34.386
- Mm.
- Oh, man.

09:34.455 --> 09:36.155
- You are the worst.
- Mm.

09:36.257 --> 09:37.623
Well, I had some help.

09:37.691 --> 09:40.891
We have officially gerrymandered
the entire city.

09:40.993 --> 09:42.528
You're guaranteed a second term.

09:42.630 --> 09:43.759
Do you know what that means?

09:43.821 --> 09:45.964
That means we finally get
to dump all that toxic waste

09:46.066 --> 09:48.932
- in the river.
- Every. Last. Drop.

09:49.001 --> 09:51.001
Oh, I love it when you
talk gerrymandering.

09:51.103 --> 09:52.836
- Not as much as I love doing it.
- Val!

09:52.938 --> 09:55.339
Courtney Rose?

09:55.441 --> 09:56.607
Oh, right. You're still here.

09:56.709 --> 09:59.043
You remember Val, my chief of staff.

09:59.111 --> 10:00.411
Aren't you supposed to be, uh,

10:00.513 --> 10:04.414
- rapping in Fresno or something?
- Fresno? Hell, no.

10:04.517 --> 10:06.651
- You are.
- Or h-hell, yes.

10:06.713 --> 10:07.745
Yes, I am.

10:07.807 --> 10:09.686
I just came back
to see how my city was doing

10:09.754 --> 10:12.222
and see how you guys are doing
after the big victory.

10:12.324 --> 10:14.724
- We're doing great.
- Yeah.

10:14.826 --> 10:16.726
Thanks for stopping by, Colleen.

10:16.795 --> 10:17.794
Courtney.

10:17.896 --> 10:19.262
Courtney, Colleen,

10:19.364 --> 10:21.363
- Leslie, Trixie... who cares?
- Mm.

10:21.465 --> 10:22.698
And you're not doing great.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.400
The atrium is filled with protesters.

10:24.502 --> 10:25.734
Can we just arrest them already?

10:25.836 --> 10:27.536
Please do.
They give me the heebie-jeebies.

10:27.638 --> 10:28.671
- You got it, Eddy.
- Oh.

10:28.739 --> 10:31.106
- "Eddy"?
- We are "v" close, Leslie.

10:31.209 --> 10:33.475
That little lady's gonna make me
a senator.

10:34.745 --> 10:36.417
Val, Val, wait, please!

10:36.471 --> 10:38.013
Hey, how could you work
for a guy like Gunt?

10:38.115 --> 10:40.215
That little man is gonna make me
a senator one day.

10:40.317 --> 10:42.717
Good for you, but what is
the city doing for Christmas?

10:43.736 --> 10:44.924
Come on. You remember the Gandhi thing...

10:44.979 --> 10:47.463
you can judge a society by how
it treats its most vulnerable?

10:47.510 --> 10:50.166
Oh, please. Gandhi was weeks into
his hunger strike by then...

10:50.213 --> 10:51.326
he was totally delirious.

10:51.394 --> 10:53.428
Gandhi. That guy was all marketing.

10:53.475 --> 10:54.407
Oh, my God.

10:54.446 --> 10:55.429
She is a totally different person.

10:57.366 --> 10:58.832
Val was always ambitious,

10:58.934 --> 11:01.034
but with you as mayor, she broke good.

11:01.103 --> 11:02.802
Yeah, with Gunt as mayor, she broke bad.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.472
Awesome.

11:05.574 --> 11:07.207
Okay, apartment looks amazing.

11:07.309 --> 11:08.208
Mom looks great.

11:08.310 --> 11:09.343
- "Great"?
- Yeah.

11:09.445 --> 11:11.010
She is a timeless beauty!

11:11.113 --> 11:12.945
She's strong, sophisticated.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.747
Aww, there you are, baby.

11:14.849 --> 11:16.616
- Uh, oh. You know what?
- Who is...

11:16.718 --> 11:18.884
I was supposed to show you life
if you had never become mayor.

11:18.986 --> 11:20.686
This is life if you had never been born.

11:20.788 --> 11:22.154
- Who's that?
- Close your eyes.

11:22.257 --> 11:24.323
Mm. I'm so glad we never had kids.

11:24.425 --> 11:25.791
Rawr! Oh!

11:25.893 --> 11:27.493
Get it, Miss Dina.

11:27.562 --> 11:28.861
He cute, girl.

11:33.038 --> 11:35.124
- What's that noise?
- Oh, that's T.K.

11:35.180 --> 11:36.580
- He sold his car.
- No way.

11:36.648 --> 11:37.676
He loves that car.

11:37.716 --> 11:39.082
Well, without their jobs at City Hall,

11:39.184 --> 11:41.585
Jermaine thought it'd be a great
idea to buy 25 pay phones,

11:41.687 --> 11:42.885
and then T.K. sold his car

11:42.987 --> 11:44.321
so he could buy a stake
in the "company."

11:44.423 --> 11:46.022
- W...
- It's been three months.

11:46.091 --> 11:47.489
They've made $1.25.

11:47.592 --> 11:48.490
Did you check the phones today?

11:48.593 --> 11:50.058
Just a Canadian quarter.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.627
Why did you bring me into this mess?!

11:51.729 --> 11:53.362
I thought that
there would be a bigger market

11:53.464 --> 11:54.896
for people who wanted
to get off the grid.

11:54.998 --> 11:56.665
You said "mountains of quarters."

11:56.734 --> 11:58.701
- I thought quarters were just gonna fly in!
- I see no quarters!

11:58.777 --> 11:59.942
- I don't see no quarters coming in...
- T.K. and Jermaine, are you two

11:59.966 --> 12:01.169
arguing again?

12:01.239 --> 12:02.804
Cut it out. It's Christmas.

12:03.098 --> 12:05.183
I'm gonna go heat up some dinner and...

12:05.253 --> 12:06.337
Courtney!

12:06.371 --> 12:07.878
I didn't think you were gonna
be home for Christmas!

12:07.917 --> 12:09.944
Oh, of course.
Like I wouldn't come home for Christmas.

12:10.046 --> 12:11.746
Remember, you're not home...
you're on tour.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.147
Running for mayor
got you a lot of attention,

12:13.216 --> 12:14.915
and now you're capitalizing on it.

12:15.017 --> 12:17.985
What if I told you that
you can make $10,000 a month

12:18.087 --> 12:19.520
just from sitting at home?

12:21.290 --> 12:23.724
My hat. Yeah, sorry. I forgot my hat.

12:23.825 --> 12:26.226
I should... I s...
I should probably get going.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.662
Yeah, you know, I guess there's
nothing left for you here.

12:28.764 --> 12:30.664
like... friendship.

12:30.766 --> 12:32.633
So now even my own boys don't like me?

12:32.701 --> 12:34.968
Well, you ditched them
to chase your music career.

12:35.070 --> 12:36.450
Would <i> you</i> like you?

12:36.497 --> 12:37.903
All right, come on.
Let's get me outta here.

12:38.005 --> 12:39.705
You better watch your tone
talking to me.

12:43.270 --> 12:44.479
So...

12:44.535 --> 12:47.160
- my boys are broke, and they hate me.
- Mm-hmm. Yep.

12:47.238 --> 12:48.614
And it's all because I'm not mayor?

12:48.716 --> 12:49.948
- What... is it my fault?
- Yes.

12:50.050 --> 12:50.983
Oh.

12:51.085 --> 12:52.551
Well, that's not
an epiphany-level thing,

12:52.654 --> 12:53.819
so we gonna have to try again.

12:53.921 --> 12:55.487
But we've seen everyone.

12:55.555 --> 12:57.622
It's not just
how your <i> people</i> are doing...

12:57.724 --> 12:59.758
it's how your <i> city</i> is doing.

12:59.759 --> 13:00.736
_

13:00.761 --> 13:03.027
Oh, no. No. No, no, no, no.

13:03.129 --> 13:04.362
I thought the bus strike
was in its third month.

13:04.431 --> 13:06.230
Oh, it is. This is referring
to the <i> garbage</i> strike.

13:06.333 --> 13:07.699
Oh, look where we are.

13:07.768 --> 13:10.034
Fort Grey Elementary?

13:10.136 --> 13:11.635
What... are the teachers on strike, too?

13:11.737 --> 13:13.671
Mm. What do you hear?

13:14.674 --> 13:16.239
Nothing.

13:16.342 --> 13:18.074
Right. Because there's no
music program for the kids.

13:18.143 --> 13:20.877
But, yeah, the school's closed.
It's Christmas.

13:20.979 --> 13:22.446
- Of course there wouldn't be any noise.
- Don't get smart with me!

13:22.548 --> 13:23.647
- I'm just...
- It'd be sad, even if it was open.

13:23.749 --> 13:24.748
- You know, I can't stand you.
- I...

13:24.850 --> 13:26.684
Make me sick,
like I got nothing better to do

13:26.786 --> 13:28.418
than drive you around Fort Grey all day.

13:28.520 --> 13:29.752
Do you even have your wings?

13:29.854 --> 13:31.220
Don't you worry about me!

13:31.323 --> 13:33.556
- Well, at least the roads are smooth.
- Mm-hmm.

13:33.658 --> 13:34.657
We haven't hit a single pothole.

13:34.759 --> 13:35.725
Gunt <i> did</i> do that.

13:35.827 --> 13:36.892
He couldn't wait to fill those potholes.

13:36.994 --> 13:38.761
Oh, this is what we came to see.

13:38.863 --> 13:40.162
Wait. That's the shelter.

13:40.264 --> 13:41.764
Oh, that <i> was</i> the shelter.

13:41.866 --> 13:43.433
Gunt cut a lot of the social services.

13:43.535 --> 13:44.767
You know, those, uh, ski-lift tickets

13:44.869 --> 13:46.702
- aren't gonna pay for themselves.
- The Baxters.

13:46.804 --> 13:48.503
Wait. If the shelter's closed
in this world,

13:48.605 --> 13:50.116
that means they have no place to go.

13:50.218 --> 13:51.785
That's right... they don't.

13:51.886 --> 13:54.754
But why would Gunt close
the shelter and pave the roads?

13:54.856 --> 13:55.954
I don't get it.

14:01.228 --> 14:03.227
- Oh. I get it.
- Mm.

14:06.601 --> 14:08.577
I cannot believe
things are so much worse

14:08.624 --> 14:09.657
because I'm not mayor.

14:09.726 --> 14:11.559
I felt like I wasn't
accomplishing anything.

14:11.694 --> 14:13.161
Well, little stuff, maybe.

14:13.230 --> 14:14.662
Those things you call little add up.

14:14.731 --> 14:16.630
A-A bus bench. A music program.

14:16.733 --> 14:18.099
They all have a practical purpose,

14:18.201 --> 14:20.235
but they also mean something more.

14:20.303 --> 14:22.337
They are all symbols of a mayor

14:22.405 --> 14:24.637
who wants good things for his city.

14:24.740 --> 14:26.606
I <i> do</i> want good things for the city.

14:26.708 --> 14:29.076
Well, having a mayor that cares
makes a difference.

14:29.178 --> 14:30.443
You inspire people.

14:30.545 --> 14:32.846
So they then feel better and do better.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.614
It's a ripple effect.

14:34.716 --> 14:37.417
So what Fort Grey is missing...

14:37.519 --> 14:38.785
is... is me?

14:38.854 --> 14:40.854
Well?

14:40.955 --> 14:43.155
Yes?

14:43.224 --> 14:44.757
It's an epiphany!

14:44.859 --> 14:46.425
We're going to the Atlantis!

14:46.527 --> 14:48.827
You can sit on a dolphin while you gamble.
So I need you to gather your things

14:48.897 --> 14:50.863
- and shuffle on to the left.
- What do you... What do you mean?

14:50.932 --> 14:51.998
- Yeah, it's been nice spending time with you.
- Wait. What do you... What do you mean?

14:52.100 --> 14:53.132
What do you mean?! Wait, wait, wait.

14:53.234 --> 14:54.466
I'mma take a scuba resort course.

14:54.535 --> 14:55.534
- Bye!
- Wait. Can I go back?

14:55.603 --> 14:57.603
Why aren't you answering me?!

14:57.705 --> 14:59.004
I want to be mayor again!

14:59.106 --> 15:02.407
Why do you angel types
got to be so cryptic?!

15:12.752 --> 15:15.352
My bus benches are covered.

15:15.421 --> 15:17.121
My bus benches are covered!

15:18.590 --> 15:21.491
My bus benches are covered!!

15:21.593 --> 15:22.859
My bus benches are covered!

15:22.929 --> 15:24.861
Whoo-hoo! Hello, Fort Grey!

15:24.964 --> 15:26.463
Hello! Hello, little boy!

15:26.565 --> 15:27.864
Look. Mayor Rose has gone crazy!

15:27.967 --> 15:30.767
Yes, "Mayor Rose"...
I love hearing those words.

15:30.869 --> 15:32.135
Thank you, little boy.

15:32.237 --> 15:33.736
It's not a compliment!

15:33.838 --> 15:34.770
"Mayor Rose!"

15:34.872 --> 15:37.807
Hello, Fort Grey!

15:37.885 --> 15:39.805
- On this strip alone...
- Christmas!

15:39.859 --> 15:41.978
...potholes have caused multiple
car accidents just this year.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.113
Oh, hi! Hello. Hi.

15:44.215 --> 15:46.215
I'm so sorry. I know you're just
doing your job, but...

15:46.284 --> 15:47.616
oh, although, it is Christmas Eve.

15:47.718 --> 15:49.584
I believe you deserve
the night off. May I?

15:49.686 --> 15:51.386
I called Dina, the police stations,

15:51.488 --> 15:53.455
all of the kennels,
and no one has seen Courtney.

15:53.523 --> 15:54.856
Maybe we should go look for him.

15:54.959 --> 15:56.992
Uh, I found him.

15:59.330 --> 16:01.096
<i>Thank you. Hello, Fort Grey!</i>

16:01.198 --> 16:03.065
<i>This is Mayor Rose,
and I am here to tell you</i>

16:03.167 --> 16:06.300
<i>that you matter and what you do matters.</i>

16:06.369 --> 16:09.170
<i>I was feeling really sad today
because I felt like</i>

16:09.238 --> 16:10.471
<i>I couldn't make a real difference,</i>

16:10.539 --> 16:11.605
<i>but I was wrong.</i>

16:11.674 --> 16:13.607
<i>Every action makes a difference,</i>

16:13.709 --> 16:14.842
<i>no matter how small.</i>

16:14.944 --> 16:16.344
<i>People will tell you that what you do</i>

16:16.412 --> 16:19.447
<i>doesn't reeeeeally matter,
but that is not true.</i>

16:19.548 --> 16:21.782
<i>As long as you do something.</i>

16:21.851 --> 16:22.916
What a freak.

16:22.985 --> 16:24.017
So, while I can't do everything

16:24.119 --> 16:25.518
that I really want to do for this city,

16:25.620 --> 16:27.720
I'm gonna feel good
about the things that I <i> can</i> do.

16:27.822 --> 16:29.589
So I'm heading down
to the family shelter,

16:29.691 --> 16:31.924
and I'm gonna keep my promise
and make their Christmas

16:32.027 --> 16:33.159
the happiest it can be!

16:33.261 --> 16:34.694
Thank you!

16:37.004 --> 16:38.831
Yeah!

16:38.933 --> 16:40.499
- Oh!
- That was, uh...

16:40.601 --> 16:41.566
Wait.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.802
Also, I'm gonna fix these potholes.

16:43.871 --> 16:46.771
That is the first thing
up in 2018, okay?

16:46.874 --> 16:48.407
Back to Gabby Montoya.

16:49.307 --> 16:50.506
And merry Christmas!

16:50.585 --> 16:53.045
That was Mayor Rose with
a surprise Christmas message.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.415
Hey, hey, hey!

16:56.517 --> 16:58.187
- Merry Christmas!
- Hey! Mayor Rose!

16:58.250 --> 16:59.850
Hey, Mr. Baxter, merry Christmas!

16:59.919 --> 17:01.486
I'm just here to read a few books.

17:01.587 --> 17:02.920
I'll... I'll pass out some pizzas...

17:03.023 --> 17:04.288
- whatever you need.
- There you are.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.689
Oh, my gosh. Guys, guys!

17:05.790 --> 17:07.525
- Hey!
- No, no, Courtney, please.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.593
My bits and pieces!
I'm so sorry I disappeared.

17:09.694 --> 17:10.895
I just wanted to make sure
that these people

17:10.963 --> 17:12.195
have the Christmas they deserve.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.064
That's why we're here.
We raided the office supplies.

17:14.133 --> 17:16.662
Yeah. Paper plus scissors
plus tape equals snowflakes.

17:16.740 --> 17:17.726
Hey, man.

17:17.801 --> 17:20.770
And we may have had
a couple presents laying around.

17:20.872 --> 17:22.271
Come on, guys.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.141
That was a very good speech
you made, Courtney,

17:24.209 --> 17:25.842
but if you ever disappear
like that again,

17:25.944 --> 17:27.477
then I'm gonna do a lot more...

17:27.579 --> 17:28.645
with these scissors.

17:28.713 --> 17:30.980
Yes, that's the Val I know.
You broke good, huh?

17:31.082 --> 17:33.315
Sure.

17:33.384 --> 17:35.384
Okay, so, how about we take that tree

17:35.453 --> 17:37.486
and move it to
the center of the room, okay?

17:37.588 --> 17:39.121
It's ugly, but it could be worse.

17:39.223 --> 17:40.689
Of course, it could be better.

17:40.758 --> 17:42.024
Ma?

17:42.126 --> 17:43.792
Wait. Did you bring this tree
all the way from home?

17:43.894 --> 17:44.826
Of course. What's the good
of having a mail truck

17:44.895 --> 17:45.961
if you can't stick it in your truck

17:46.064 --> 17:47.696
after your son makes
a beautiful speech on TV?

17:47.798 --> 17:50.045
Oh, mm, thanks, Ma.
Thanks for coming to help out.

17:50.100 --> 17:51.066
I'm not the only one, baby.

17:51.134 --> 17:53.201
Wait. Whoa.

17:53.303 --> 17:54.469
Hey, wait.

17:54.571 --> 17:55.736
Is this all because of my speech?

17:55.838 --> 17:57.338
These people want to do good.

17:57.407 --> 17:58.706
You just inspired them to do it.

17:58.808 --> 17:59.840
Oh, thank you.

18:07.015 --> 18:09.749
Merry Christmas!

18:09.851 --> 18:11.385
Six pairs of
Golden State Warriors socks.

18:11.487 --> 18:14.054
- Gift card for an oil change.
- Aww.

18:14.156 --> 18:17.757
Beignet mix from New Orleans.

18:17.826 --> 18:19.659
Here you go, little mama.
Be careful. It's heavy.

18:19.728 --> 18:20.994
Poetry magnets.

18:21.097 --> 18:22.995
Oh!

18:23.098 --> 18:24.330
You got me some great gifts.

18:24.399 --> 18:25.931
<i>You</i> got <i> me</i> some great gifts.

18:26.033 --> 18:28.101
Tropical body spray... which one of you?

18:28.203 --> 18:29.268
Huh? Huh?

18:31.473 --> 18:33.339
Well, well, well, Mayor Rose.

18:33.408 --> 18:36.409
Congratulations on another
little Goonies adventure.

18:36.511 --> 18:37.977
Wait. How did you hurt your foot?

18:38.079 --> 18:39.411
Did you go skiing in Mammoth?

18:39.480 --> 18:41.480
No, dummy.
I told you I couldn't afford it.

18:41.548 --> 18:43.047
I fell down the stairs.

18:43.150 --> 18:44.749
And thank goodness I did,

18:44.818 --> 18:47.185
because it was the perfect
excuse to skip the ski trip.

18:47.254 --> 18:49.354
- Mm.
- Now, where do I put the potatoes?

18:49.423 --> 18:51.456
Wow. There must be
a Santa Claus somewhere.

18:51.558 --> 18:53.057
Come here, Gunt.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.426
Keep your pants on.

18:54.528 --> 18:56.927
All right.

18:57.029 --> 18:58.429
This is a great party.

18:58.531 --> 18:59.663
It's a wonderful thing you did, babe.

18:59.732 --> 19:01.132
That we <i> all</i> did.

19:01.234 --> 19:02.966
- And thanks, Mom.
- Mm-hmm.

19:03.035 --> 19:05.802
You <i> are</i> my mom, right?
You're not an angel?

19:05.871 --> 19:08.405
- Can't I be both?
- Yeah, yeah. Of course.

19:08.508 --> 19:10.807
I just wanted to make sure it was you.

19:10.909 --> 19:14.410
Miss Dina, would you please
join us at the piano?

19:14.446 --> 19:16.679
- All right.
- Let's get these Christmas carols poppin'.

19:21.153 --> 19:25.555
♪ Joy to the world, the Lord is come ♪

19:25.657 --> 19:31.860

20:06.728 --> 20:08.928

- Thank you.

20:21.522 --> 20:23.323
Hey, uh, you looking for Courtney?

20:23.373 --> 20:24.514
I don't know where he is.

20:24.568 --> 20:26.961
He's probably breakdancing
for some orphans or something.

20:26.994 --> 20:28.034
I'm not Dina.

20:28.059 --> 20:29.073
I'm Angel Dina,

20:29.098 --> 20:31.034
and I'm here to whip
your sorry soul into shape.

20:31.097 --> 20:33.634
This happens a lot... every Christmas.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.803
I get drunk at the office,
I fall asleep,

20:36.837 --> 20:40.074
and then I get visited
by some sassy ghost

20:40.107 --> 20:43.042
who takes me to my childhood
or shows me my grave.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.877
One even tried to teach me empathy

20:44.911 --> 20:45.879
by turning me into a woman.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.247
That was hot.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.222
Well, uh, I-I have to take you
on some kind of journey.

20:49.276 --> 20:50.331
It's the rules.

20:50.362 --> 20:51.719
Why don't you just turn me
into a woman again?

20:51.751 --> 20:52.786
But nice feet, though.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.088
Okay, I think this one's for downstairs.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.088
You good with that?

20:55.122 --> 20:57.224
Actually, I have a catalog...
I can show you what she looks...

20:57.257 --> 20:58.292
Okay.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.961
