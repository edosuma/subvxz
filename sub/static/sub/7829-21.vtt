Uh... upstate New York.

the phrase "steamed hams."

09:37.618 --> 09:39.996
Oh, not in Utica, no,
it's an Albany expression.

09:40.079 --> 09:40.955
I see.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.375
You know, these hamburgers
are quite similar

at Krusty Burger.

with cheese, right?

12:38.549 --> 12:40.426

20:27.476 --> 20:28.936
NELSON: Crud!

20:29.019 --> 20:33.106
Do you find something comical
about my appearance

20:33.190 --> 20:35.359
when I'm driving
my automobile?

20:35.442 --> 20:37.069
Yeah.

20:37.152 --> 20:40.781
Everyone needs to drive
a vehicle, even the very tall.

20:40.864 --> 20:44.326
This was the largest auto
that I could afford.

20:44.409 --> 20:47.412
Should I, therefore,
be made the subject of fun?

20:47.496 --> 20:48.997
I guess so.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.249
(frustrated grunt)

20:50.332 --> 20:52.042
Would you like it

20:52.125 --> 20:54.253
if I laughed
at your misfortune?

20:54.336 --> 20:55.796
Huh?!

20:55.879 --> 20:57.631
Maybe we should find out.

20:57.714 --> 20:59.049
(grunts)

20:59.132 --> 21:01.009
Now... march!

21:02.844 --> 21:04.179
(horn honking)

21:04.263 --> 21:06.598
Hey, everybody,
look at this!

21:06.682 --> 21:09.559
It's that boy
who laughs at everyone.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.520
Let's laugh at him.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.563
ALL: Ha! Ha!

21:13.647 --> 21:17.109
Wave to the people!

21:17.192 --> 21:18.860
Blow them kisses!

21:20.237 --> 21:23.115
(bawling)

21:26.994 --> 21:30.080
(guffawing)

21:30.163 --> 21:33.000
Well, Milhouse,
I guess interesting stuff

21:33.083 --> 21:35.460
does happen to people
in Springfield.

21:35.544 --> 21:39.506
Yep. Everybody in town's
got their story to tell.

21:39.589 --> 21:41.800
There's just
not enough time

21:41.883 --> 21:42.968
to hear them all.

21:43.051 --> 21:44.219
(panting)

21:44.303 --> 21:46.888
Oh, sorry I'm late.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.515
There was trouble at the lab--

21:48.598 --> 21:50.100
with the running,
the exploding and the crying.

21:50.183 --> 21:52.978
One of the monkeys
stole the glasses off my head!

21:53.061 --> 21:54.521
No, wait. Please, no!

21:54.604 --> 21:57.024
Please, I have a funny story--
if you listen.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.442
I even wrote theme music.

21:58.525 --> 21:59.693
Yeah, listen--
