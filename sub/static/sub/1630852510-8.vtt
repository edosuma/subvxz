09:51.224 --> 09:53.424
It's what the family wanted.

09:53.493 --> 09:56.094

biostasis,

09:56.229 --> 09:58.830

could take the body there

09:58.965 --> 10:00.899
And start the perfusion.

overreacted.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.372

what time his heart stopped.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.731
- Yeah, and get an exact time
of death?

10:33.867 --> 10:35.867
- Right. If I can get a look
at the echocardiogram,

10:35.936 --> 10:38.135
I may be able to tell
if it was a heart attack

10:38.171 --> 10:41.206
Or something more sinister,
like lilium's suggesting.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.208
- That'd be an impressive trick.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.676
- Yeah, it's worth a shot.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.211
(blood trickles)

10:46.346 --> 10:48.345
Donovan: That's blood.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.817
(sheet rustles)

10:52.886 --> 10:54.618
- That's a perfusion machine.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.156
- I'm gonna go with sinister.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.624
(suspenseful music)

11:01.795 --> 11:03.928
(blood trickles)

11:03.930 --> 11:06.531
- Perfusion machines are
usually used in hospitals

11:06.666 --> 11:09.434
To recirculate blood in a,
in a heart surgery.

11:09.436 --> 11:12.203
- So, you're saying that's five
litres of xavier lorde's blood.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.972
- Dollars to donuts.

11:13.974 --> 11:16.340
And perfusions normally
take a couple of hours.

11:16.410 --> 11:18.343
- Yeah, then dollars to donuts,

11:18.345 --> 11:20.511
Olivia was lying about
finding him at 7:00 a.M..

11:20.580 --> 11:22.580
- Yeah. Exactly.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.415
(gurney rattles)

11:27.421 --> 11:29.788
Olivia: Stop!
You're killing him!

11:29.790 --> 11:31.856
Do you not understand?

11:31.925 --> 11:34.058
Man: Coming through!
- Please stop!

11:35.829 --> 11:38.496
Murderer.
- This is a suspicious death.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.864
I don't have a choice.

11:39.999 --> 11:41.733
- I won't let you do this.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.735
Please.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.870
Please.

11:46.005 --> 11:47.906
I'm begging you.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.074
I'll stop this autopsy.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.876
I'm calling my lawyer.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.083
E,

11:59.119 --> 12:00.952
He performed the perfusion?

12:01.021 --> 12:03.154
- Do you know what the
perfusion process is,

12:03.289 --> 12:04.956
Detective mcavoy?

12:05.091 --> 12:07.558
Or why it's essential
to our science?

12:07.594 --> 12:09.260
- Yes, actually,

12:09.395 --> 12:11.095
Dr. Cooper explained it
a little bit.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.297
It's when you pump the blood
from the body

12:13.333 --> 12:15.299
And replace it with an
organ-preserving solution,

12:15.335 --> 12:17.335
Kinda like an antifreeze.
- That's right.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.570
Without it, the cryo-freezing
process

12:19.606 --> 12:21.705
Could cause the water in
the blood to expand,

12:21.742 --> 12:24.642
Destroy the cells,
and putrefy the organs.

12:24.644 --> 12:27.545
- But I also know that even
the most skilled perfusionist

12:27.547 --> 12:30.447
Would take at least three
hours to complete that job.

12:30.484 --> 12:33.184
You still wanna convince me
that good ol' cedric

12:33.319 --> 12:34.853
Is just the night nurse?

12:36.089 --> 12:37.655
Let me ask you,

12:37.791 --> 12:39.924
What makes you so certain
xavier will be brought back?

12:39.960 --> 12:41.860
It's never been done before.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.862
- Tell that to the wright
brothers.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.331
- Okay.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.001
- Unimpressed by man learning
to fly?

12:50.136 --> 12:52.737
How about harnessing
nuclear energy?

12:54.007 --> 12:55.873
The internet?

12:55.909 --> 12:59.811
You see, nothing seems
plausible until we make it so.

13:01.515 --> 13:04.015
Then we forget, and act as if
it were there all the time.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.317
(knock on door,
door beeps, opens)

13:08.054 --> 13:09.587
(light footsteps)
donovan: (sighs)

13:11.091 --> 13:12.756
One moment, please.

13:13.893 --> 13:15.759
- Security camera from
the neighbour's showed

13:15.796 --> 13:17.328
A van arriving at
about 4:30 a.M.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.796
And leaving just before
8:00 a.M..

13:18.931 --> 13:20.631
- That's when they pumped
the blood.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.966
That van have a logo?

13:22.101 --> 13:23.367
- No, but I ran the plates.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.503
It's a rental leased out
to cryosleep inc..

13:26.873 --> 13:28.773
Ah, xavier lorde's research
assistant uh, got in touch,

13:28.908 --> 13:30.774
She's looking for that
talking box thing.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.510
- Good. Bring her in.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.511
- All right. I'll see
what I can find out.

13:34.548 --> 13:36.047
(door closes)

13:38.585 --> 13:39.984
River: We can't touch him.

13:40.119 --> 13:41.853
Jenny: According to his wife's
lawyer, no,

13:41.988 --> 13:43.787
But I uh, I'm working on it.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.789
Dr. Garcia: Can he at least be
moved into a locker?

13:45.826 --> 13:47.391
- The frozen carbon dioxide

13:47.460 --> 13:49.460
Is as good as putting him
in the morgue. He'll keep.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.229
- So, nobody touches him
'til I say so.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.898
Oh, hey, uh, dr. Garcia,

13:53.967 --> 13:56.434
Thank you for doing this
on such short notice.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.336
I appreciate it.
- Are you kidding me?

13:58.405 --> 14:01.072
This is one for the books.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.176
(footsteps thud)

14:05.245 --> 14:06.777
<i> (low hum of chatter,</i>
<i> phones ring)</i>

14:10.950 --> 14:12.750
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

14:12.752 --> 14:15.820
- Uh, should we talk, or--
- sorry, uh,

14:15.955 --> 14:18.623
Thank you for doing this,
and uh, yeah, we uh--

14:18.625 --> 14:20.425
(video call chimes)
- uh, looks like we're up.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.026
<i> Woman: The honourable judge</i>
<i> helen koo is now ready.</i>

14:22.161 --> 14:23.894
<i> Proceedings can begin.</i>

14:25.866 --> 14:27.831
Clark: Judge koo,
clark coleman of the crown

14:27.868 --> 14:29.633
Representing the office
the coroner

14:29.669 --> 14:31.802
In a jurisdictional matter.

14:31.872 --> 14:34.172
It's time sensitive, so, thank
you for accommodating us.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.040
<i> Judge koo: What are the facts?</i>

14:36.175 --> 14:38.309
- Yes, thank you.

14:38.311 --> 14:41.379
Uh, the next of kin is trying
to block my autopsy.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.714
The decedent has a will, uh,

14:43.750 --> 14:47.585
In which they express their
wishes to be cryo-preserved.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.720
- And is the autopsy warranted?

14:49.756 --> 14:51.789
Clark: Well, the parties
involved have been deceitful,

14:51.791 --> 14:53.658
And as you can see from the
documents that I've sent you,

14:53.793 --> 14:56.260
The body has also been
interfered with.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.829
- That's good enough for me,
mr. Coleman.

14:57.831 --> 15:00.264
Dr. Cooper, paperwork will
be forwarded to your office.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.866
You may proceed with
your examination.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.135
- Thank you. Wonderful.
Thank you.

15:05.171 --> 15:07.071
Okay.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.741
- So, it's probably not
a good time, is it?

15:12.012 --> 15:14.145
- Uh, sorry um, no,

15:14.280 --> 15:16.113
Can uh, can we...

15:17.150 --> 15:18.983
Can we raincheck?

15:19.119 --> 15:20.618
- I can wait.

15:23.223 --> 15:24.888
- Okay.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.359
(blinds rattle)

15:28.494 --> 15:30.695
(footsteps approach)

15:30.697 --> 15:32.830
(ominous music)

15:34.167 --> 15:35.766
(blinds rattle)

15:38.972 --> 15:40.771
- (huffs)

15:43.710 --> 15:46.177
Hey, are you okay?

15:46.246 --> 15:47.978
- Me?
- Yeah.

15:48.014 --> 15:50.047
- I'm fine, kiddo,
don't you worry.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.849
(footsteps shuffle)

15:51.918 --> 15:54.352
(blinds rattle)

15:58.959 --> 16:01.125
(sighs)
I promise, I'm fine!

16:02.729 --> 16:04.261
- You saw her again.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.198
Where?
- Where? Everywhere!

16:08.234 --> 16:09.867
I saw her in there, she's
in that window over there,

16:10.003 --> 16:11.702
Now she's over here.

16:11.705 --> 16:14.872
I saw her at the dining room
window.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.940
Look, it's...It's different.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.876
It's not like it was.

16:18.878 --> 16:21.279
I, I don't know if I like it.
It's just not the same.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.716
I mean, I shouldn't look.
Right?

16:26.920 --> 16:29.287
I, I know she's not there,
so, my looking for her,

16:29.289 --> 16:30.955
This looking is only gonna
make it worse,

16:31.090 --> 16:33.357
But I just miss her so much.
(cries)

16:33.426 --> 16:35.360
- I know.
- I miss my peggy.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.830
It was great for a while,
there.

16:39.866 --> 16:42.700
You know, conjuring her up
and seeing her again,

16:42.835 --> 16:44.102
But it's just not the same.

16:44.237 --> 16:47.638
- Listen... What can I do?

16:47.674 --> 16:49.640
How can I help?

16:49.642 --> 16:52.976
- My god, you don't know,
do ya?

16:54.614 --> 16:57.648
Just you listening to me
and not thinking of me

16:57.650 --> 17:00.451
I'm ju--as a crazy old man,
it just means the world to me.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.853
- (sighs)
- don't know what I'd do

17:02.922 --> 17:04.755
Without ya,
to tell ya the truth.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.860
- I think I better take a nap.
- I think so.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.862
- Just a 20-minute nap.
Wake me up.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.464
- I'll bring you some.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.767
♪♪♪

17:19.839 --> 17:22.039
(engine rumbles, beeping)

17:23.409 --> 17:25.176
- How could he not straighten
these things?

17:25.311 --> 17:27.612
(frames rattle)

17:27.614 --> 17:30.081
- Looks like the members
of cryosleep.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.016
- Yeah, probably.

17:32.151 --> 17:35.219
- Check out the one on the end.
It's our boy, cedric.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.154
(rushing footsteps approach)

17:38.458 --> 17:40.691
- Looking to secure
your future?

17:40.693 --> 17:42.926
Uh, please excuse my lunch.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.631
Busy, busy, we're always
eating on the run.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.432
Please, have a seat.

17:48.501 --> 17:51.569
I am the chief physician
of this facility,

17:51.638 --> 17:54.438
Dr. Benedict yeats,
but please, call me dr. Ned,

17:54.507 --> 17:56.441
Everybody does.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.510
- I'm detective mcavoy, this is
dr. Jenny cooper, the coroner.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.312
- Yes, I was expecting you.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.147
Uh, we, we have nothing to hide.

18:03.149 --> 18:05.516
- Not even about cedric there,
employee of the month?

18:05.552 --> 18:08.051
Not quite a night nurse, is he?

18:08.088 --> 18:10.721
- He's a highly qualified
perfusionist.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.657
I, I hope he's not being
charged with anything?

18:13.693 --> 18:15.526
- Not yet.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.861
Tell me, why did he lie
about who he was

18:17.897 --> 18:19.329
And what he was doing there?

18:19.365 --> 18:21.665
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.467
It was a misunderstanding.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.936
My team and I absolutely
performed the perfusion

18:25.972 --> 18:27.371
On xavier lorde.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.807
I have a legally binding
contract to do so.

18:29.876 --> 18:32.743
- Okay, so olivia just,
just called you that night?

18:33.880 --> 18:36.413
- Yeah, well that's the name
of the game.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.550
We can't exactly book
appointments for our clients.

18:39.685 --> 18:42.286
We aren't involved pre-mortem.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.955
- Because that would be illegal.
- (clears throat)

18:45.024 --> 18:47.358
What time did olivia call you?

18:47.493 --> 18:49.092
- Uh... About uh, 4:00.

18:50.897 --> 18:54.098
Yeah, shortly after xavier
achieved biostasis.

18:54.233 --> 18:57.902
We arrived about 30 minutes uh,
after, and but,

18:57.904 --> 19:01.706
We left before we were able
to complete the transport.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.708
- You mean, when the
stepdaughter, lilium, arrived.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.845
- Yes, knowing there was
going to be uh, you know,

19:07.980 --> 19:11.315
A family issue,
we opted to leave quietly.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.453
- Okay. And what,
what happens now?

19:17.624 --> 19:20.258
- Well, now I'm awaiting
instructions from olivia.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.994
- Could we take a look
around your facility?

19:24.129 --> 19:25.463
(chair squeaks)

19:25.598 --> 19:27.197
Dr. Yeats: Cryotherapy bay

19:27.233 --> 19:30.334
Is home to cryosleep's
153 souls.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.938
<i> As you can see,</i>

19:33.940 --> 19:36.473
<i> Each of our patients</i>
<i> has their own capsule.</i>

19:36.509 --> 19:38.209
- Your patients?

19:38.278 --> 19:40.277
- Our members have chosen
not to accept death

19:40.413 --> 19:42.313
As a foregone conclusion.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.248
We place them in liquid
nitrogen,

19:44.284 --> 19:47.952
Lowering them to a temperature
of -190 degrees celsius,

19:49.622 --> 19:53.156
And then they reside here
in members bay.

19:53.293 --> 19:56.159
- Have any of your members ever
been successfully resuscitated?

19:57.197 --> 19:58.895
- No, not yet,

19:58.932 --> 20:00.831
But the science is far closer
to a breakthrough

20:00.833 --> 20:03.334
Than you might think.
- Oh, is that so?

20:03.469 --> 20:05.969
How much does it cost
to get set up in here?

20:06.005 --> 20:09.573
- It's $265,000 for full
cryo-preservation,

20:09.642 --> 20:12.376
And $125,000 for a neuro only.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.246
- By neuro, you mean--
- just the head.

20:19.519 --> 20:22.519
- Um, I noticed there are very
few of you working here.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.522
- It's an intimate operation.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.259
I do have some part-time staff
to assist with the intakes.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.027
- And these intakes,

20:30.096 --> 20:32.329
They've never interfered with
a death investigation before?

20:32.365 --> 20:35.198
- Interfered?
No, no, no, no.

20:35.235 --> 20:38.835
We've done it this way
153 times. No dispute.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.707
Uh, tell me,

20:42.842 --> 20:44.875
Will we be receiving
xavier lorde's body today?

20:44.911 --> 20:47.344
- I don't know, but I will uh,

20:47.380 --> 20:49.546
I'll keep you posted.
- Okay.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.018
But you know, you wait too long,
he won't be any good to me.

20:54.153 --> 20:56.153
(crunches apple)
- to you?

20:56.155 --> 20:58.756
(loud crash, system shuts down,
restarts)

21:01.127 --> 21:04.028
- Hm. Must be a power outage
in the neighbourhood.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.762
(chuckles)

21:05.898 --> 21:07.564
- Hm.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.202
(footsteps thud on steps)

21:13.572 --> 21:15.839
- Is it just me, or is this
place janky as hell?

21:15.875 --> 21:17.775
- Oh, it's not you.
Pretty understaffed

21:17.910 --> 21:19.844
For a high-tech operation.
- Yeah.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.512
- Catch those light flickers?

21:21.581 --> 21:23.513
- Oh, hey, uh...

21:23.549 --> 21:25.716
Heart monitor data just came in.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.987
Xavier's heart started slowing
slightly,

21:30.056 --> 21:32.056
But noticeably around 4:30 a.M..

21:32.058 --> 21:33.791
- And does it look like
natural death?

21:33.860 --> 21:35.860
- No, it's inconclusive.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.661
Hopefully the autopsy
will tell us more.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.329
I'll let you know what I find.

21:39.365 --> 21:41.665
(sighs)

21:41.667 --> 21:43.600
(gurney rattles)

21:48.041 --> 21:49.940
Wonder if they're actively
recruiting people

21:49.942 --> 21:51.542
To keep the lights on?

21:51.544 --> 21:54.412
- Yeah. Recruiting them?
Or killing them?

21:54.414 --> 21:57.081

21:57.216 --> 21:59.049
(door shuts, engine starts)

22:06.826 --> 22:08.893

into cardiac distress,

22:08.895 --> 22:11.962
Why not call an ambulance?
Why call cryosleep?

22:11.998 --> 22:14.031
- It's what he wanted.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.632
- I know it's what cryosleep
wanted.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.235
I took a look at their
financials - a lot of red.

22:18.371 --> 22:21.105
They need your $265,000.

22:22.441 --> 22:24.442
Did you also know that their
membership relies heavily

22:24.444 --> 22:26.110
On high profile names?

22:26.245 --> 22:28.178
Names like yours
and your husband's?

22:28.247 --> 22:30.981
- So? Ask.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.315

22:33.419 --> 22:35.653
Was xavier alive or dead

22:35.655 --> 22:37.654
When cedric arrived
to perfuse him?

22:39.492 --> 22:42.927
- You think I'm some stupid
old lady who can't let go?

22:44.664 --> 22:46.864
So desperate to hold on
to her husband

22:46.933 --> 22:48.999
That she'll let cryosleep
kill him

22:49.001 --> 22:50.467
And take my money?

22:51.704 --> 22:53.203
- Did they?

22:53.339 --> 22:54.605

22:58.210 --> 23:00.678
We were going to be young again.

23:04.483 --> 23:07.418
The way we live now is barbaric.

23:09.422 --> 23:11.254
Aging is a crime.

23:12.392 --> 23:15.292
To let a brilliant mind
like his just be stolen,

23:17.029 --> 23:19.362
It's absurd.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.566
- I'll admit,

23:22.701 --> 23:25.502
The future where no one
gets sick or dies,

23:26.939 --> 23:29.105
Sounds pretty nice.

23:30.443 --> 23:32.509
But it also doesn't sound real.

23:32.545 --> 23:34.711
I've been to this cryosleep
place,

23:34.713 --> 23:36.514
And I'll tell ya,
it felt like a trick,

23:36.516 --> 23:38.815
Like I was on the set
of a cheap magic show.

23:41.287 --> 23:43.787
- I don't care about
the window dressing.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.856
I believe in the science.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.927
Imagination can change
the world.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.995
Maybe you're not using
yours enough.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.666
Look, will you let me show you
something?

23:58.438 --> 23:59.903
Humour me.

you developed this

24:06.646 --> 24:08.946
To help people who've lost
the ability to speak.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.347
- That's a part of it.

24:10.483 --> 24:12.349
The main project is
brain emulation.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.018
- Huh.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.286
- Imagine you could scan
a brain,

24:16.288 --> 24:18.489
Then construct a software
model of it.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.690
That was our goal,

24:20.726 --> 24:23.360
To replicate xavier's
consciousness and upload it.

24:23.362 --> 24:24.761
<i> - (impressed huff)</i>

24:24.797 --> 24:28.565

What does that, what does
that mean, exactly?

24:40.947 --> 24:42.780
- The software?
- Yeah.

24:42.915 --> 24:45.549
- Or ai, hasn't yet achieved um,

24:46.919 --> 24:48.786
Actual awareness.

24:48.921 --> 24:51.922
The device still needs verbal
cues to interact with.

24:52.057 --> 24:54.658

24:54.793 --> 24:56.927

conversations

25:00.666 --> 25:03.400
With lilium and xavier?

25:04.670 --> 25:06.537
- I have them here,
if you wanna take a listen.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.739

That would be great.

He's gonna wanna hear that.
- Yeah, of course.

25:40.306 --> 25:41.771

I'll be right back.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.949
I know they're going to autopsy
my husband's body.

26:27.086 --> 26:30.420
But his brain can still be
saved by cryonics.

26:34.159 --> 26:35.759
Jenny: They did a good job.

26:35.828 --> 26:38.161
- Yeah. It only took six hours
too, so.

26:39.665 --> 26:42.098
- Well, I'll take them out
for you.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.901
- (sharp inhale) hm.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.302
- I'll take them out

26:45.371 --> 26:46.904
So you, save you some time.

26:50.709 --> 26:52.509
(indistinct background chatter)

27:05.391 --> 27:06.656
(chair rattles)

27:06.692 --> 27:09.025
- Wait, wait, wait,
let me show you something.

27:13.499 --> 27:15.165
Here, take a look.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.337
- What is this?

27:20.472 --> 27:23.907
- This is a small,
beautiful piece of land.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.678
And I just bought it.
- (surprised gasp)

27:27.813 --> 27:29.412
- (small laugh)

27:30.750 --> 27:33.984
- Yeah. I think we can start
over, just...

27:36.555 --> 27:38.956
Try to build something together.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.690
You know?

27:42.428 --> 27:43.694
- Yeah.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.767
It's just...

27:50.803 --> 27:52.635
You know, what if we...

27:55.007 --> 27:56.707
What if we try this again
and we just end up

27:56.776 --> 27:59.910
In the exact same place?
- No, no, jenny, listen. Listen.

28:00.045 --> 28:02.312
Something happened to me
yesterday,

28:02.314 --> 28:04.314
Now everything is clear.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.450
The only thing that I want is--
(knock on door)

28:07.786 --> 28:09.586
- We're, we're ready for you.

28:09.722 --> 28:11.722

28:13.258 --> 28:14.924
- Okay, I can wait.

28:17.262 --> 28:20.063
- Okay.
(footsteps recede)

28:22.534 --> 28:24.334
Dr. Garcia: Feel that?
The pulmonic valve?

28:24.470 --> 28:26.603
Jenny: Yeah,
could be a blockage.

28:26.605 --> 28:29.139
It's hard to tell without
having any history of the heart.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.808
- And without a tox screen,

28:30.943 --> 28:33.443
I can't confirm any kind of
injection or drug overdose.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.678
- Yeah, a lethal arrhythmia

28:35.715 --> 28:38.214
Would've shown up
on the heart monitor data.

28:38.216 --> 28:41.284
Unless they uh, unplugged it
before they gave him the shot.

28:42.621 --> 28:45.155
River: The widow really
wants to freeze the brain.

28:45.157 --> 28:47.224
- I know, but she may have
killed him,

28:47.293 --> 28:48.759
So we need to know how he died.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.827
Can we confirm the cause of
death with what we've got?

28:50.863 --> 28:52.996
- Not that I can see.

28:52.998 --> 28:56.699
- Okay. All right, well, yeah,
just gotta do it.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.703
(saw whirrs)

29:04.409 --> 29:05.776
(scull cracks)

29:11.951 --> 29:14.050
- (sighs)
(snipping sounds)

29:15.521 --> 29:16.753
- Whoa! Hey, hey, stop, stop,
stop.

29:16.888 --> 29:18.688
His brain. Stop!

29:20.893 --> 29:23.459
(brain oozes, plops)

29:23.496 --> 29:26.462
Oh, my god, his brain
is completely liquified.

29:26.499 --> 29:28.298
I don't understand,
I mean this,

29:28.334 --> 29:30.400
This level of decomposition
would mean that he had

29:30.436 --> 29:33.470
To have been brain-dead
for at least 48 hours.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.205
- At least.

29:35.241 --> 29:37.074
- But both his wife
and his daughter said

29:37.209 --> 29:38.942
That they had communication
with him yesterday.

29:39.011 --> 29:41.445
- That's not possible.
- No, it's not,

29:41.580 --> 29:43.947
Not unless they were
talking to the dead.

29:44.082 --> 29:46.015
(suspenseful music)

29:52.458 --> 29:53.756
- Hello?

29:56.262 --> 29:57.861
Anybody there?

29:59.765 --> 30:01.965
- Xavier was locked in.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.768
This device it works on the
eye tracking tech, right?

30:07.807 --> 30:09.439
Yeah.

30:09.475 --> 30:12.041
Without xavier, I don't think
we're gonna get anything.

30:17.382 --> 30:19.115
- Hi, daddy.

30:19.151 --> 30:21.584
<i> Xavier: Lilium,</i>
<i> my sweet lily-bear.</i>

30:22.822 --> 30:25.521
<i> So happy to hear your voice.</i>

30:25.558 --> 30:26.924
- (shaky exhale)

30:27.059 --> 30:28.925
All right, teja,
I wanna be very clear,

30:29.061 --> 30:31.528
Are you saying it's probable
that when olivia and lilium

30:31.663 --> 30:33.597
Were talking to xavier
yesterday,

30:33.732 --> 30:34.998
They were actually
talking to that?

30:35.133 --> 30:38.135
- Things have always been toxic
between lilium and olivia.

30:39.605 --> 30:42.672
Communicating with them
was draining for xavier.

30:42.741 --> 30:44.541
He was always caught
in the middle.

30:44.676 --> 30:45.876
- So, you made some adjustments.

30:46.011 --> 30:48.111
- I reprogrammed the box.

30:49.415 --> 30:52.816
I wrote in an algorithm to
mimic xavier's conversation,

30:52.951 --> 30:55.051
To use his words
and his expressions.

30:56.421 --> 30:58.422
- So, the algorithm was created
to de-escalate conflict

30:58.557 --> 31:00.157
Between them?

31:00.159 --> 31:02.492
Tell olivia and lilium
what they wanted to hear?

31:02.494 --> 31:04.494
<i> Teja: So that he wouldn't</i>
<i> have to.</i>

31:04.496 --> 31:06.363
<i> So that he could rest.</i>

31:06.498 --> 31:08.765
The algorithm is triggered
by verbal cues

31:08.834 --> 31:11.401
Specific to lilium and olivia.

31:11.403 --> 31:13.536
<i> Dad, daddy, darling,</i>

31:13.606 --> 31:15.838
<i> My love, and so on.</i>

31:17.643 --> 31:20.110
So, yes, when they thought
they were talking to xavier,

31:20.179 --> 31:22.312
It was the box talking.

31:22.447 --> 31:24.181
100%.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.416
Olivia: That's impossible.
I don't believe you.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.552
Jenny: It's the truth.

31:28.687 --> 31:31.421
The autopsy revealed that
xavier lost brain function

31:31.423 --> 31:33.457
Days ago.

Xavier would say different
things to lilium and me.
