called the police

in The Godfather.

I mean, that dude
didn't say he hit a horse.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.292

they were gonna kill him.

right before someone gets hurt.

gonna hurt in jail?

to the police, okay?

ourselves, okay?

13:05.327 --> 13:06.995
Plus, I'm pretty sure
he's illiterate,

13:07.078 --> 13:08.788
and that message has
way too many words in it.

13:08.872 --> 13:10.999
Well, someone knows,
which means

13:11.082 --> 13:12.918
someone must have
said something.

13:15.253 --> 13:18.131
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Did you say something?

13:18.215 --> 13:20.175
No, of course not.

13:22.177 --> 13:23.220
What about Dylan.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.804
He didn't do this.
He's not a narc

13:24.888 --> 13:26.473
and his best friend's
a fucking drug dealer.

happened, they can't prove it.
