05:26.917 --> 05:29.001
Madam, this child is a witch.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.959
From the time that this child

05:33.126 --> 05:36.126
came into the village,

05:37.042 --> 05:39.876
Lots of strange things
have been happening,

05:40.042 --> 05:42.001
things that never
used to happen.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.876
Strange things have been
happening in the village

05:45.042 --> 05:46.376
since she got here.

05:46.542 --> 05:48.709
We don't know where
she came from.

05:49.084 --> 05:50.876
She has no friends,

05:51.042 --> 05:52.584
she has no relatives,

05:52.751 --> 05:54.584
she wanders around
like a lost person.

05:54.751 --> 05:57.834
This is what I'm saying, madam.
She's a witch.

05:58.334 --> 06:00.126
This child is a witch.

06:07.376 --> 06:09.417
From the day it happened,

06:09.584 --> 06:11.751
no-one draws water
from that well,

06:11.917 --> 06:13.917
not for drinking,
not for bathing,

06:14.084 --> 06:15.584
because we're scared,

06:15.751 --> 06:17.626
because of this witch.

06:17.959 --> 06:19.292
This child is a witch.

06:19.542 --> 06:22.334
I'm telling you, this
girl is a witch.

06:28.501 --> 06:30.042
This is the water?

06:40.084 --> 06:42.417
This is what I'm saying, madam.

06:42.751 --> 06:44.042
She's a witch.

06:51.251 --> 06:53.231
You're making noise?
What do you want?

06:53.251 --> 06:55.209
I have something to say as well.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.542
I'm a witness.

07:09.042 --> 07:12.209
Yes, I am a witness.
This girl is a witch.

07:16.376 --> 07:19.084
I was ploughing my field,

07:20.626 --> 07:22.417
like I always do,

07:23.876 --> 07:27.147
when I noticed a small shadow.

07:27.167 --> 07:29.709
It came above me,
on top of my head.

07:33.584 --> 07:35.667
I didn't take any notice,

07:35.834 --> 07:37.917
I thought it was just a cloud.

07:41.376 --> 07:44.959
Then... I heard laughter.

07:49.251 --> 07:50.959
I looked around...

07:51.709 --> 07:53.417
and I saw this girl.

07:54.292 --> 07:55.626
The child sitting here?

07:55.792 --> 07:58.001
The same one... just
standing there.

08:01.459 --> 08:03.126
What was she doing?

08:03.292 --> 08:05.042
She was just standing there.

08:09.584 --> 08:11.376
Yes, she was just
standing there.

08:11.542 --> 08:13.209
And what did you do?

08:14.792 --> 08:18.792
Then I looked again and
realised she had an axe.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.042
Now, do you know
what happened next?

08:25.667 --> 08:28.542
She hit me with the axe!

08:31.209 --> 08:33.833
She hit me across the arm.

08:34.667 --> 08:37.376
Then my arm fell to the ground.

08:40.001 --> 08:42.251
Then all my blood
splashed on the ground.

08:46.876 --> 08:49.084
So what did you do after
your arm fell off?

08:55.959 --> 08:57.292
Well...

08:57.751 --> 09:00.126
Ever since I had that dream...

09:01.126 --> 09:02.501
It was just a dream!

09:04.542 --> 09:07.959
Now my wife is the one
that goes to the field...

09:08.084 --> 09:09.292
alone.

09:12.001 --> 09:13.001
Are you done?

09:15.292 --> 09:18.459
Yes. Aren't you going to
write down my statement?

09:18.584 --> 09:21.126
- Leave! We've heard you.
- OK. I'll go.

09:32.751 --> 09:36.209
See all those people outside...
and her?

09:37.917 --> 09:39.751
They're saying you're a witch.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.667
What's your name?

09:50.417 --> 09:51.876
Answer!

09:52.084 --> 09:53.167
She's a witch.

09:53.334 --> 09:55.042
Yes, she's a witch.

10:05.292 --> 10:06.917
Your back?

10:07.084 --> 10:08.417
Let me...

10:08.792 --> 10:11.417
Just turn a little bit.

10:15.001 --> 10:16.606
It's fine.

10:16.626 --> 10:18.459
Is that my phone?

10:18.959 --> 10:20.626
Is that the phone ringing?

10:20.917 --> 10:22.856
- Is that my phone?
- Yes.

10:22.876 --> 10:24.834
I'm coming. I'm coming, baby.

10:36.626 --> 10:39.042
I don't know the number.
I don't know who it is.

12:43.334 --> 12:46.106
I am a witch doctor, a real one.

12:46.126 --> 12:47.542
I'm very well-known.

12:48.042 --> 12:50.292
I've helped a lot of people.

12:50.667 --> 12:52.814
I've helped lots of people.

12:52.834 --> 12:54.709
Children have been healed.

12:55.792 --> 12:58.897
So you know that I am
a real witch doctor,

12:58.917 --> 13:01.167
I'll take all my clothes off.

13:09.584 --> 13:11.917
There, I've taken them off.

13:13.084 --> 13:16.001
See, I don't have
anything to hide.

13:16.167 --> 13:18.959
See? I don't have anything.
Nothing.

13:19.584 --> 13:21.834
Now you see I'm a witch doctor.

13:37.792 --> 13:39.376
This chicken,

13:41.876 --> 13:46.001
if it dies inside the circle,
it means she's not a witch.

13:46.501 --> 13:49.584
If it dies outside the circle,

13:49.792 --> 13:52.167
it means she is a witch.

14:13.084 --> 14:14.584
Go on. Dance.

14:18.542 --> 14:21.042
The way you were
doing it before.

14:45.209 --> 14:48.292
Are you tired?

14:48.751 --> 14:49.834
Keep going.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.209
Why are you so surprised?

16:45.501 --> 16:47.709
This is your new member.

16:50.667 --> 16:52.167
Aren't you happy?

17:22.416 --> 17:24.041
How can you run away?

17:27.834 --> 17:29.459
Bring her here.

17:30.126 --> 17:32.876
A little child like you,
causing us all this trouble...

17:34.959 --> 17:37.292
You should be grateful.

18:42.334 --> 18:47.126
So, working together,
witches, civil servants...

18:51.376 --> 18:54.667
You should teach this girl

18:55.917 --> 18:59.084
how you live as witches in
cooperation with the Government.

19:02.584 --> 19:05.126
Now, I want you
to sing that song

19:05.251 --> 19:07.459
we always sing on
these occasions,

19:07.626 --> 19:10.709
so she feels welcome,

19:10.834 --> 19:12.917
like we usually do.

19:16.167 --> 19:18.292
Where's that woman that leads?

19:19.167 --> 19:22.751
<i>We're soldiers for the
Government and we're used to it.</i>

19:23.584 --> 19:27.251
<i>We're used to it and
don't get tired.</i>

19:27.417 --> 19:31.189
<i>We're soldiers for the
Government and we're used to it.</i>

19:31.209 --> 19:34.751
<i>We're used to it and
don't get tired...</i>

20:51.542 --> 20:53.459
Stand up, little girl.

20:56.459 --> 20:59.042
I believe the ladies have
explained everything.

21:00.709 --> 21:02.564
Now it's up to you,

21:02.584 --> 21:05.876
whether to be a goat or a witch.

21:06.834 --> 21:09.834
If you choose to be a
goat, cut the ribbon.

21:09.959 --> 21:12.459
But, if you choose
to be a witch,

21:12.667 --> 21:14.459
keep your ribbon intact.

21:14.626 --> 21:17.209
Then you'll join
this witch camp.

21:17.917 --> 21:19.417
- Mannaseh!
- Sir?

21:19.584 --> 21:21.126
Bring the knife.

21:25.459 --> 21:26.834
Here's the knife.

21:27.001 --> 21:28.459
Go into that little house.

21:28.626 --> 21:30.042
In the morning,

21:30.501 --> 21:32.917
we'll know which you've chosen.

21:33.334 --> 21:34.334
Go.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.126
Make some noise, ladies.

22:22.751 --> 22:23.959
Hello.

22:26.709 --> 22:28.501
Is there a witch in there?

22:30.792 --> 22:32.459
Yes, there's a witch in here.

22:41.501 --> 22:43.001
Come out, you witch!

22:44.959 --> 22:47.417
There is the witch.

22:49.501 --> 22:51.626
Come out, come out, come out.

23:02.126 --> 23:05.209
What I'm doing here is just
a little bit of scarring.

23:05.376 --> 23:08.334
It'll heal quickly. Don't worry.

23:08.834 --> 23:11.834
It's just like a
tattoo I'm giving you.

23:12.209 --> 23:14.542
Don't worry, it'll heal.

23:22.251 --> 23:25.459
They're just tattoos.
They'll heal.

23:25.626 --> 23:27.876
Don't worry, you don't
have to be scared.

23:28.042 --> 23:29.459
Don't be scared.

23:29.792 --> 23:31.584
They are just like little cuts.

23:31.751 --> 23:34.959
I'll put some of this on
to make it heal quickly.

26:02.584 --> 26:05.751
I'm exhausted, I can't.

26:11.876 --> 26:13.167
Mr Tembo!

26:13.334 --> 26:16.709
How can you wake me up
this early for work?

26:16.876 --> 26:18.209
Mr Tembo!

26:21.209 --> 26:23.126
You're so mean, Mr Tembo.

26:23.376 --> 26:26.167
How can I go farming?
I'm too tired.

26:26.334 --> 26:28.542
- Mr Tembo!
- This is too much.

26:45.292 --> 26:47.292
You, little girl.

26:47.792 --> 26:49.584
You're so lucky.

26:50.084 --> 26:53.626
Mrs Dettol only had a
short ribbon, like this.

26:54.501 --> 26:58.667
She couldn't turn around.
She couldn't go anywhere.

26:59.376 --> 27:01.834
You're really lucky,

27:02.001 --> 27:04.042
you have a long ribbon.

27:05.584 --> 27:08.126
You're free to go
this way and that,

27:08.292 --> 27:11.209
you can go here and there
with your long ribbon.

27:11.376 --> 27:13.251
You're so lucky.

27:13.417 --> 27:14.709
You should be eating.

27:14.876 --> 27:16.417
This girl...

27:17.334 --> 27:19.459
I've named her Shula.

27:25.626 --> 27:27.084
It's a nice name.

27:27.251 --> 27:30.959
It's a very nice name.

27:31.084 --> 27:35.542
Listen, it means to be uprooted.

27:36.251 --> 27:37.751
This girl has been uprooted.

27:37.917 --> 27:40.292
It's a very nice name.

27:42.251 --> 27:44.376
Keep eating. Keep eating, child.

27:44.542 --> 27:46.334
It's a really lucky name.

28:13.376 --> 28:14.876
Mr Tembo!

28:15.876 --> 28:19.042
When I die, I Will kill you.

28:19.209 --> 28:22.834
When my spirit awakens,
I'll kill all your family.

28:23.001 --> 28:25.584
I don't want Shula to
work in the fields.

28:34.542 --> 28:36.792
Hold this close to your ear.

28:36.959 --> 28:40.542
Point it in the direction of the wind.
Do you understand?

28:48.334 --> 28:49.959
Can you hear anything?

28:51.834 --> 28:55.751
There are kids playing over there,
where the noise is coming from.

28:57.251 --> 28:59.709
Shula, have you ever
been to school?

29:00.126 --> 29:01.792
Never been to school?

29:02.626 --> 29:06.542
You know what? Every time
we go to work on the farms,

29:07.167 --> 29:09.542
there's always a school nearby.

29:09.709 --> 29:12.834
If you go there,
there's a school.

29:13.001 --> 29:16.459
Everywhere we work,
there's a school nearby.

29:16.626 --> 29:21.001
So I want you to listen
to these schools.

30:29.959 --> 30:32.084
They're taking Shula away.

30:35.751 --> 30:39.542
They can't just take her. Why would they?
She's too little.

30:39.834 --> 30:41.501
Shula is just too little.

30:41.667 --> 30:43.001
What's the problem here?

30:43.167 --> 30:45.542
It's about Shula, how
can you take her?

30:45.709 --> 30:47.751
When I needed someone,
did they not refuse?

30:48.001 --> 30:49.084
They did.

30:49.292 --> 30:50.876
We didn't refuse at all.

31:25.917 --> 31:29.834
Little girl, put it on.
Just apply.

32:04.876 --> 32:06.834
Grandpa, come and stand here.

32:08.251 --> 32:09.834
Grandpa, just come
and stand here.

32:14.376 --> 32:16.626
Grandpa, switch
off that phone...

32:16.792 --> 32:18.542
This is a court room,
you don't do that.

32:20.667 --> 32:23.792
If you have a phone,
just switch it off.

32:23.959 --> 32:25.667
Switch them off right now.

32:26.792 --> 32:30.626
Switch them off. Switch
them off completely.

32:33.501 --> 32:35.251
Have you switched
it off, grandpa?

32:35.417 --> 32:36.584
- What?
- Wait.

32:36.751 --> 32:38.292
Switch it off.

32:38.417 --> 32:40.209
Anyone else with a phone...

32:42.084 --> 32:44.334
Shut down your phones.

32:45.834 --> 32:48.126
Your phone is ringing as
if you've got credit!

32:48.584 --> 32:49.834
Start.

32:50.167 --> 32:52.167
I am here in court

32:54.001 --> 32:57.959
to find out who took my money.

32:58.126 --> 32:59.167
Grandpa,

32:59.334 --> 33:00.751
switch off your phone.

33:01.751 --> 33:05.376
- I can't see because of the sun.
- Switch it off!

33:06.334 --> 33:08.542
- Remove the battery.
- Take out the battery.

33:08.709 --> 33:10.292
Let me help you.

33:10.459 --> 33:11.834
You, switch it off.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.167
Remove the battery.

33:16.001 --> 33:17.334
Can I start now?

33:18.584 --> 33:20.876
I'm here in court

33:21.042 --> 33:25.376
because someone stole
my dowry money.

33:25.542 --> 33:28.251
To whoever stole it,

33:28.501 --> 33:31.084
what goes around comes around.
Thank you.

33:31.251 --> 33:32.834
Thank you, sit down.

33:33.292 --> 33:34.501
What goes around...

33:34.667 --> 33:35.959
- comes around.
- Good.

33:36.126 --> 33:38.584
All the suspects, you
know who you are?

33:39.584 --> 33:41.834
All the suspects stand up.

33:43.792 --> 33:45.542
Suspect number one, let's go.

33:51.792 --> 33:53.834
Did you steal the money or not?

33:54.834 --> 33:56.459
No, I didn't.

34:01.834 --> 34:03.792
Did you steal the money or not?

34:04.251 --> 34:05.292
No, I didn't.

34:10.833 --> 34:12.417
Did you steal the money or not?

34:12.583 --> 34:14.126
No, I didn't steal it.

34:17.126 --> 34:18.708
Did you steal the money or not?

34:18.876 --> 34:20.208
No, I didn't.

34:27.583 --> 34:28.751
Hello, Grandma.

34:30.083 --> 34:31.292
It's me Shula.

34:31.458 --> 34:32.708
What is it, Shula?

34:32.876 --> 34:37.417
They've lined up
all the suspects

34:37.583 --> 34:39.458
but I don't know who it is.

34:39.626 --> 34:42.542
Can you help me pick one?

34:42.708 --> 34:44.251
Pick the dark one.

34:45.376 --> 34:47.417
The one who looks scared.

34:47.583 --> 34:49.583
The one who's looking up.

34:52.417 --> 34:54.417
The one who looks
down at the ground.

34:55.626 --> 34:58.334
- But...
- He'll be the one.

34:58.501 --> 35:00.459
But there are three dark ones.

35:00.626 --> 35:03.084
The one who looks nervous.

35:03.251 --> 35:05.084
He's the one.

35:08.084 --> 35:10.751
One of you is the culprit.

35:10.917 --> 35:13.459
We will now consult the spirits.

35:13.626 --> 35:16.834
She will point out
who the culprit is.

35:17.001 --> 35:19.126
- Do we agree?
- We do.

35:21.959 --> 35:23.667
Which one of these
idiots did it?

35:33.126 --> 35:35.209
It's the one wearing red.

35:35.667 --> 35:38.126
The one in red? Good.

35:38.292 --> 35:40.334
- You wearing the...
- It's not me, Boss.

35:40.501 --> 35:42.584
She's picked you. Why
are you denying it?

35:42.751 --> 35:44.147
As God is my witness,
sir, it's not me.

35:44.167 --> 35:46.606
- Who did she point to?
- Him.

35:46.626 --> 35:48.542
- Why are you refusing?
- It's not me.

35:48.709 --> 35:50.251
She pointed to say you did it.

35:50.417 --> 35:52.084
As God is my witness...

35:52.251 --> 35:53.751
- What?
- As God is my witness.

35:53.917 --> 35:56.542
God? Is God here?

35:56.709 --> 35:58.751
- She picked you.
- I didn't, boss.

35:59.209 --> 36:01.334
I'm being falsely accused.

36:02.876 --> 36:05.542
Listen, everyone, you're
all still suspects.

36:05.709 --> 36:08.626
- Suspects.
- Until we've searched him.

36:11.834 --> 36:15.292
She picked you but
you're arguing,

36:15.459 --> 36:17.876
so all of you are
still suspects.

36:18.459 --> 36:20.001
Good. Suspects!

36:39.876 --> 36:41.876
We have surrounded
the whole house.

36:46.667 --> 36:48.084
How are you?

36:48.251 --> 36:50.501
- Is this Nelson's place?
- Yes.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.792
Get everyone out.

37:04.667 --> 37:07.126
- Sit over there.
- Hurry, we've got work to do.

37:08.126 --> 37:10.001
- Are you Nelson's wife?
- Yes.

37:10.167 --> 37:11.751
Sit over there.

37:12.334 --> 37:13.834
Go over there.

37:14.626 --> 37:16.334
Are they all coming
out of this house?

37:16.501 --> 37:18.584
Is this a house or a coach?

37:22.876 --> 37:24.959
I said sit down over there.

37:25.126 --> 37:26.834
Get her out as well.

37:28.626 --> 37:30.292
Is everyone out?

37:36.584 --> 37:40.084
Hey you, little witch, you're
saying I stole the money.

37:40.251 --> 37:42.209
It wasn't me. You're lying.

37:42.376 --> 37:46.001
When they find out it's not me,
we'll stone you or burn you alive.

37:46.167 --> 37:49.376
You're telling lies,
you and grandpa.

37:49.542 --> 37:52.417
Once I'm cleared, we'll
burn you and stone you.

37:52.542 --> 37:55.751
Just tell the truth.
This affects us all.

37:55.917 --> 37:57.501
He's innocent, guys.

37:57.667 --> 38:00.292
She's lying. He says
he didn't do it.

38:00.459 --> 38:02.834
He should just tell the truth.

38:07.667 --> 38:11.417
Weren't you denying it, saying
you didn't know anything?

38:16.292 --> 38:17.834
Get out of the way.

38:18.001 --> 38:19.584
Thief!

38:21.751 --> 38:22.876
Go!

38:26.334 --> 38:28.167
It's you who stole it.

38:35.209 --> 38:36.542
You Will hurt him!

38:37.209 --> 38:38.459
He's a thief!

38:39.334 --> 38:40.459
Hit him!

39:03.417 --> 39:06.417
- What?
- Let me get the basket.

39:21.542 --> 39:22.709
Shula.

39:23.459 --> 39:26.584
How did you know that
he was the thief?

39:27.667 --> 39:30.917
Out of all of them, how
did you know it was him?

39:31.751 --> 39:32.876
You are a witch, right?

39:33.042 --> 39:34.501
You really are a witch.

39:34.667 --> 39:36.167
You are my little witch.

39:36.334 --> 39:38.001
Right? My little witch.

39:39.542 --> 39:42.459
We will leave those old
ladies working on the farms.

39:42.626 --> 39:45.126
You and I, we'll work together.

39:45.292 --> 39:47.001
Shula, my little witch.

39:47.167 --> 39:48.709
My little witch.

39:49.334 --> 39:52.751
You and me, we'll
work together, right?

39:52.917 --> 39:54.917
You are very good.

39:55.084 --> 39:57.167
You're a nice witch.

39:57.334 --> 39:59.334
See, the offerings
are now coming.

40:02.459 --> 40:03.917
Thank you.

42:12.001 --> 42:13.584
She's saying hello.

42:14.251 --> 42:15.667
Hi!

42:25.667 --> 42:27.917
Our visitor has arrived.

42:28.501 --> 42:30.917
It's good she's come.

42:31.667 --> 42:33.209
Welcome.

42:35.709 --> 42:38.209
- Let's go.
- You are welcome.

42:40.667 --> 42:43.209
It's good you brought her.

42:44.334 --> 42:46.209
It's really good.

42:47.709 --> 42:49.667
I'm happy that you've come.

42:49.834 --> 42:52.334
I've been waiting for you.

42:56.501 --> 42:58.001
I will see you.

43:04.209 --> 43:06.876
I am so happy that you've come.

43:07.126 --> 43:08.834
Now, listen.

43:09.459 --> 43:11.751
I'm going to pour some gin here.

43:11.917 --> 43:14.209
It's not disrespectful.

43:14.876 --> 43:17.709
If any witch comes here,

43:17.876 --> 43:20.292
I get scared that bad
spirits might come in.

43:20.459 --> 43:23.042
I don't want bad spirits
entering the house,

43:23.209 --> 43:26.042
only good spirits,
do you understand?

43:26.459 --> 43:28.917
Don't think about
it in a bad way.

43:29.084 --> 43:32.209
I only want good
spirits coming in.

43:40.042 --> 43:42.042
Do you know what I
want to show you?

43:42.667 --> 43:45.084
This is a chandelier.

43:46.126 --> 43:47.376
Say chandelier.

43:49.334 --> 43:51.251
When you switch on
the lights at night,

43:51.417 --> 43:53.459
it's really something to see.

43:57.876 --> 43:59.417
Just uncover it.

44:04.376 --> 44:06.042
You have one as well?

44:08.417 --> 44:09.792
You're shocked.

44:14.209 --> 44:16.834
Come and sit over here
and I'll explain.

44:20.626 --> 44:23.584
I used to be like you
when I was a kid.

44:24.042 --> 44:26.709
Like you, they used to
take me out all the time.

44:26.876 --> 44:29.084
I used to be taken
around in a truck.

44:30.376 --> 44:33.292
They used to follow
me everywhere.

44:35.459 --> 44:39.917
They said I couldn't
go anywhere,

44:40.084 --> 44:44.042
they said I couldn't cut
the ribbon or do anything.

44:44.876 --> 44:48.084
They said if I cut the ribbon,

44:48.376 --> 44:50.876
I'd turn into a goat.

44:51.709 --> 44:54.584
Now, I didn't turn into a goat.

44:54.751 --> 44:56.709
And do you know why?

44:59.876 --> 45:02.959
Respectability. Do you
know what that is?

45:03.417 --> 45:06.542
Respect through marriage.

45:06.709 --> 45:08.876
Do you know how I
became this way?

45:09.042 --> 45:11.959
Because I did
everything I was told.

45:12.126 --> 45:14.334
I did everything I was told.

45:14.459 --> 45:17.876
If I was told do this, do that,

45:18.042 --> 45:20.626
go here and go there.

45:20.792 --> 45:24.501
I did it all without question.

45:24.667 --> 45:26.084
I had respect.

45:26.251 --> 45:28.751
So, if you do the same,

45:28.917 --> 45:30.459
you'll be just like me,

45:30.626 --> 45:32.459
maybe even better.

45:40.376 --> 45:42.126
Do you know how to hook it?

45:43.167 --> 45:44.834
Now turn around.

45:45.001 --> 45:46.251
Turn and look.

45:46.417 --> 45:47.667
Can you see?

46:37.667 --> 46:39.834
Do you want to call Grandma?

46:41.292 --> 46:42.542
No.

46:51.626 --> 46:53.126
- It's that one.
- Which one?

46:53.292 --> 46:54.376
This one in front.

46:54.542 --> 46:56.334
The one with the big nose?

46:56.501 --> 46:57.584
This one?

46:57.917 --> 47:00.459
She's picked you.
Shula's picked you.

47:02.251 --> 47:04.001
Shula's picked you, talk.

48:17.084 --> 48:18.792
There's no water.

49:12.709 --> 49:14.209
Mum, how are you?

49:14.709 --> 49:16.084
And who's that?

49:16.542 --> 49:19.959
- Mr Phiri, a teacher, he gave me a lift.
- Whatever.

49:25.959 --> 49:27.084
Go!

49:27.709 --> 49:29.542
You're here again?

49:29.709 --> 49:31.501
You stupid man!

49:31.667 --> 49:33.501
You idiot, didn't I tell you...

49:33.667 --> 49:36.709
don't come here! You're the one
who accused me of witchcraft!

49:36.876 --> 49:38.834
You idiot!

49:54.251 --> 49:55.417
You're brainless.

49:55.584 --> 49:57.709
If you had any sense,
you'd feel sorry for me.

49:57.876 --> 50:00.584
I'm suffering here because
he called me a witch.

50:00.751 --> 50:03.167
You're one of the reasons why
I'm suffering. You're stupid.

50:03.334 --> 50:05.167
- He's the only man who loves me.
- Shut up!

50:05.334 --> 50:08.084
What do you want me
to do, leave him?

50:10.834 --> 50:13.167
Look in the mirror, see
how nice it looks.

50:13.334 --> 50:15.376
Just pull the fringe
down in front.

50:17.126 --> 50:18.334
See?

50:18.501 --> 50:20.751
It's nice. Honestly,
you're gorgeous.

50:20.917 --> 50:24.917
Madam, try the "Mandonna",
see how it looks.

50:25.626 --> 50:29.459
This one has a
natural curl in it.

50:30.709 --> 50:33.584
Pull it down to
hide those tattoos.

50:33.751 --> 50:36.209
Hide those tattoos
on your forehead.

50:37.751 --> 50:41.167
Gosh, I look nice.
Honestly, I really do.

50:41.417 --> 50:43.084
Madam, what did you ask for?

50:43.251 --> 50:45.084
- The brown one?
- The brown one.

50:45.251 --> 50:48.542
I couldn't find a brown one,
it's gone out of fashion.

50:48.709 --> 50:51.501
That's why I brought you the latest one.
"Rahinna".

50:51.667 --> 50:53.834
- You know the American musician?
- Yes.

50:54.001 --> 50:56.709
It's really fashionable.
Let's have a look.

50:59.001 --> 51:00.626
That one's nice.

51:02.542 --> 51:04.042
This is nice.

51:04.209 --> 51:05.834
You are gorgeous.

51:06.001 --> 51:07.834
Check in the mirror.

51:09.584 --> 51:12.376
- This is really nice.
- It really is.

51:12.751 --> 51:14.209
Ladies!

51:15.292 --> 51:16.292
Mama...

51:16.459 --> 51:20.209
I see you've all got wigs on.

51:20.376 --> 51:23.751
How are you paying for them?

51:24.167 --> 51:25.251
Credit.

51:25.417 --> 51:30.209
We'll use the offerings Shula
brings back from her job.

51:30.376 --> 51:34.667
Ladies, how can you depend on
Shula, on a little girl like that?

51:34.834 --> 51:38.209
You're depending on her to
get credit for your wigs?

51:38.376 --> 51:41.167
Come on, let's not get jealous.
Let's get down to business.

51:41.334 --> 51:42.834
Now, for payment...

51:43.001 --> 51:45.667
Auntie, for that one,
the "Minny Mikaj" one,

51:45.834 --> 51:48.417
together with the
"Sim Kardashan" one,

51:48.584 --> 51:51.292
you can give me two
bottles of gin.

51:51.459 --> 51:53.501
For the...

51:53.626 --> 51:55.751
I've already told you,
for the "Beyancey"

51:55.917 --> 51:58.209
I'll charge you two gins.

52:12.167 --> 52:13.251
You.

52:13.376 --> 52:14.751
What are you doing in there?

52:15.167 --> 52:16.167
Are you a witch?

52:16.626 --> 52:17.746
What are you doing in there?

52:18.084 --> 52:19.626
What are...

52:19.959 --> 52:22.251
I've caught you, I've
found you today.

52:22.376 --> 52:24.751
You're the witch that
ate all my relatives.

52:24.917 --> 52:26.542
Come outside!

52:26.876 --> 52:28.376
I am coming in there!

52:28.542 --> 52:32.042
You'll see what will happen
to you once I get in there!

52:32.542 --> 52:33.709
You come outside!

52:34.126 --> 52:35.251
Come outside!

52:35.376 --> 52:36.542
Do you live there? Come out!

52:53.334 --> 52:54.417
Hey!

52:54.709 --> 52:55.834
Yes sir?

52:55.959 --> 52:57.084
There's a witch.

52:59.542 --> 53:01.626
- There's a witch inside!
- What witch?

53:01.751 --> 53:03.042
Haven't you seen the witch sir?

53:04.959 --> 53:07.709
- I'll slap you.
- Let the witch come out.

53:07.876 --> 53:09.001
That is a witch!

53:09.292 --> 53:10.292
No.

53:10.417 --> 53:12.167
But sir, can't you see...

53:23.334 --> 53:25.626
Add some more.

53:29.709 --> 53:30.876
This is time to celebrate,

53:31.376 --> 53:33.251
now we've grown old,
we have grey hair.

53:33.709 --> 53:35.792
This is the age to eat, this
is the age of grey hair.

53:35.917 --> 53:37.197
We're old, put some more for me.

53:39.417 --> 53:41.001
Let's drink, let's drink.

53:41.209 --> 53:43.459
<i>Let me first drink this...</i>

53:43.626 --> 53:45.792
<i>Troubled thoughts.</i>

53:46.084 --> 53:48.792
<i>These troubled thoughts
have conquered us.</i>

53:50.084 --> 53:52.209
You get the next bottle.

53:53.126 --> 53:55.834
When they come today
I'll kick you.

54:14.126 --> 54:16.959
When we arrive, make sure you do
everything I showed you at home.

54:17.084 --> 54:18.167
You understand?

54:18.334 --> 54:21.834
Make sure you do exactly as
we did before, understand?

54:21.959 --> 54:25.251
Don't be scared or
anything like that.

54:25.376 --> 54:30.667
Everything I taught you before. You
did really well. You understand?

54:31.792 --> 54:33.917
Exactly!

54:34.167 --> 54:38.084
Did I put the gin in the car?

54:40.459 --> 54:44.917
Maybe I left it on the table?
Or where did I leave it?

54:46.751 --> 54:51.584
Check to see if I put
the gin in my handbag?

54:56.417 --> 54:58.126
Look carefully.

55:01.584 --> 55:03.334
No, it's not here.

55:12.292 --> 55:14.584
There's nothing?

55:14.792 --> 55:17.376
My God. What am I going to do?

55:51.792 --> 55:53.459
Witch!

55:54.917 --> 55:56.751
There's a witch!

55:58.334 --> 56:00.417
Everyone, come and
see the witch!

56:01.001 --> 56:02.751
There it is.

56:02.917 --> 56:04.709
Come and see.

56:07.792 --> 56:09.042
What?

56:09.209 --> 56:10.542
What's your problem?

56:10.751 --> 56:12.042
Leave me alone.

56:12.292 --> 56:13.459
What is it?

56:13.584 --> 56:15.126
What is your problem?

56:16.126 --> 56:17.917
No.

56:20.084 --> 56:22.667
I've got respectability,
I'm a married woman.

56:22.917 --> 56:24.626
What is your problem?

56:25.417 --> 56:27.209
Have you ever seen a
witch looking like this?

56:30.917 --> 56:33.084
See! I knew it!

56:33.209 --> 56:34.667
There, you see that?

56:34.834 --> 56:36.709
We know them.

56:36.876 --> 56:38.376
She's the one.

56:38.501 --> 56:40.334
Do you know that I'm married?

56:40.459 --> 56:42.667
Go away.

56:42.792 --> 56:44.209
Get out of the way.

56:47.209 --> 56:49.292
You think we don't
know what that is?

56:49.959 --> 56:51.667
Kill it!

56:53.501 --> 56:55.334
Leave me alone.

57:08.501 --> 57:09.501
Shula.

57:17.876 --> 57:18.917
Shula.

57:21.042 --> 57:23.084
Look at me, cheer up.

57:24.167 --> 57:25.709
You're fine right?

58:17.667 --> 58:20.584
Start doing what we
practised at home.

59:05.917 --> 59:07.959
Rain! It will rain.

59:08.126 --> 59:11.501
It will rain. It will rain.

59:13.459 --> 59:15.209
It will rain. It will rain.

59:21.917 --> 59:24.042
The spirits have agreed.
The spirits...

59:24.209 --> 59:27.334
The spirits have agreed
that the rain will come!

59:27.501 --> 59:29.001
My God.

59:29.167 --> 59:31.334
It will rain!

59:49.459 --> 59:51.042
It will rain!

59:51.751 --> 59:53.626
The spirits have agreed.

59:53.792 --> 59:55.542
It will rain.

01:00:01.876 --> 01:00:03.209
Is that it?

01:00:03.751 --> 01:00:05.542
Yes, it will rain.

01:00:08.917 --> 01:00:10.501
Everything's fine.

01:00:58.584 --> 01:01:01.084
<i>Brisky Japan, I just
came from Lusaka.</i>

01:01:01.209 --> 01:01:03.751
<i>My friend take it easy
this is my last supper.</i>

01:01:03.876 --> 01:01:06.417
<i>If you give trouble I will
write you using a marker.</i>

01:01:06.542 --> 01:01:09.084
<i>The rap is colour purple,
listen to this girl.</i>

01:01:09.209 --> 01:01:12.042
<i>Have you ever heard a
girl who raps like this.</i>

01:01:12.167 --> 01:01:14.917
<i>Mic check one, two,
three to the four.</i>

01:01:15.042 --> 01:01:17.876
<i>My flow is a race, on
your marks let's go.</i>

01:03:04.209 --> 01:03:05.917
You're using her.

01:03:06.084 --> 01:03:07.376
You are using her.

01:03:54.001 --> 01:03:56.542
He is asking...

01:03:57.126 --> 01:04:01.001
How do you feel being a witch?

01:06:26.251 --> 01:06:28.501
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:06:28.667 --> 01:06:31.167
- What's your name?
- I'm Shula.

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:46.376
Why are you upset?

01:06:50.376 --> 01:06:52.709
Who put you in here?

01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:54.542
They're not here.

01:06:55.917 --> 01:06:57.584
Have you been here long?

01:06:57.751 --> 01:06:59.001
Yesterday.

01:07:06.667 --> 01:07:08.501
Do you know why you're here?

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:20.167
Want to take a picture with her?

01:07:23.251 --> 01:07:24.792
Shula, look here.

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:27.251
Look.

01:07:28.876 --> 01:07:29.876
Look!

01:08:14.709 --> 01:08:16.834
Shula! Shula!

01:08:27.001 --> 01:08:28.292
No.

01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:31.959
No.

01:08:34.292 --> 01:08:35.292
Hey!

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:51.376
Now look at what's happened,
she's locked us out.

01:08:51.584 --> 01:08:52.731
How do you leave keys in there?

01:08:52.751 --> 01:08:53.834
Come and try to open...

01:08:54.126 --> 01:08:55.709
Try to open with something here.

01:08:57.417 --> 01:08:59.084
Come on, lift me up.

01:09:22.917 --> 01:09:27.167
Why didn't you open the door?

01:09:27.292 --> 01:09:29.251
Sit up! Why didn't
you open the door?

01:09:30.584 --> 01:09:33.334
I'm asking you why you
didn't open the door.

01:09:35.501 --> 01:09:37.876
I'll toss you back
to where you belong.

01:09:38.126 --> 01:09:40.417
I look after you and now you're
misbehaving... You witch!

01:09:40.542 --> 01:09:46.334
Sit properly!

01:09:46.501 --> 01:09:48.376
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me!

01:09:48.626 --> 01:09:50.626
Don't look at me,
look somewhere else!

01:10:04.001 --> 01:10:06.501
Do you see that big tree?

01:10:06.959 --> 01:10:08.584
That's where I want you to go.

01:10:08.751 --> 01:10:10.959
Understand? Start moving.

01:10:43.501 --> 01:10:46.292
- What is your name?
- I'm Shula.

01:11:54.459 --> 01:11:56.209
Welcome, servant
of the Government.

01:11:56.376 --> 01:11:58.167
Thank you.

01:11:58.334 --> 01:11:59.751
How is your father?

01:12:01.334 --> 01:12:03.042
He's fine.

01:12:03.667 --> 01:12:04.876
Is that true?

01:12:05.501 --> 01:12:06.542
Yes, ma'am.

01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:08.417
When was the last
time you saw him?

01:12:09.334 --> 01:12:10.917
About a week ago,

01:12:11.084 --> 01:12:13.084
I spoke to him on the phone.

01:12:13.251 --> 01:12:15.959
- What about your mother?
- She's fine, too.

01:12:16.126 --> 01:12:18.251
I hope your wife is fine too.

01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:19.501
Yes, ma'am.

01:12:22.459 --> 01:12:24.917
I've heard rumours

01:12:25.792 --> 01:12:27.459
that we have a witch

01:12:27.626 --> 01:12:30.417
who has the power to bring rain.

01:12:30.542 --> 01:12:32.126
Yes, ma'am.

01:12:32.334 --> 01:12:34.251
People in this kingdom
are struggling.

01:12:34.376 --> 01:12:36.917
They're complaining because
they started planting,

01:12:37.084 --> 01:12:40.209
but their crops are dying in the field.
Where is the rain?

01:12:42.251 --> 01:12:47.126
I heard that it's that little
girl you sent to school.

01:12:48.167 --> 01:12:50.542
According to the laws
of the Government...

01:12:50.876 --> 01:12:52.751
- The Government?
- Yes.

01:12:52.917 --> 01:12:58.042
Tell me, where was the Government
when I brought the witches here?

01:12:58.292 --> 01:13:02.376
And where was the Government
when I was feeding them?

01:13:02.501 --> 01:13:03.667
Where was the Government?

01:13:03.834 --> 01:13:06.917
Are these the plans of the Government,
that they should come here,

01:13:07.084 --> 01:13:10.709
saying, "We'll buy you buses,
we'll buy you uniforms,"

01:13:10.876 --> 01:13:13.251
so they can get 50%?

01:13:13.417 --> 01:13:15.459
This is my kingdom.

01:13:15.626 --> 01:13:17.834
The Government has
no right at all.

01:13:19.167 --> 01:13:21.542
The Government requires
that all children...

01:13:23.209 --> 01:13:25.084
We do not send
witches to school.

01:13:25.626 --> 01:13:28.834
Go back and tell the
Government that I'm angry.

01:13:29.792 --> 01:13:31.834
And don't take anything
out or add anything!

01:13:32.001 --> 01:13:33.667
Unedited version!

01:13:33.792 --> 01:13:35.167
Yes, ma'am.

01:13:35.376 --> 01:13:36.542
Thank you.

01:13:38.084 --> 01:13:39.417
Thank you, ma'am.

01:13:44.126 --> 01:13:46.167
He's becoming stupid.

01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:59.792
If you are a witch,

01:15:59.959 --> 01:16:02.001
bring us rain.

01:16:02.167 --> 01:16:05.292
We want rain here.

01:16:05.459 --> 01:16:06.667
Hurry up.

01:16:07.167 --> 01:16:08.251
Sorry.

01:19:38.209 --> 01:19:40.251
Shula!

01:19:43.584 --> 01:19:46.459
Why are you upset child?

01:19:46.667 --> 01:19:49.042
Tell us.

01:19:49.292 --> 01:19:52.709
If you are upset you
have to say so.

01:19:52.834 --> 01:19:57.459
Shula, what's upset you? Why
are you being so stubborn?

01:19:58.584 --> 01:20:00.792
So what is bothering you Shula?

01:20:01.626 --> 01:20:05.501
I was just thinking I should
have chosen to be a goat.

01:20:05.959 --> 01:20:10.167
A goat is better. It can move about
freely and eat when it wants.

01:20:10.376 --> 01:20:12.917
I should have chosen
to become one.

01:20:13.459 --> 01:20:15.959
No Shula stop it.

01:20:16.084 --> 01:20:18.292
That's what you've been
thinking in that head of yours?

01:20:18.417 --> 01:20:20.459
You can't become a goat!

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:27.209
They will kill you and
eat you for supper.

01:24:39.126 --> 01:24:43.084
<i>Come all Let's sing for Shula.</i>

01:24:43.251 --> 01:24:46.626
<i>Come all Let's sing for her.</i>

01:24:47.167 --> 01:24:51.084
<i>Come people Let's
sing for Shula.</i>

01:24:51.251 --> 01:24:55.167
<i>Come all Let's sing for her.</i>

01:24:55.292 --> 01:24:59.376
<i>Come everyone, come all
Let's sing for Shula.</i>

01:24:59.542 --> 01:25:03.459
<i>This is the last celebration.</i>

01:25:03.584 --> 01:25:07.667
<i>Come everyone, come all
Let's sing for Shula.</i>

01:25:07.792 --> 01:25:11.917
<i>This is the last celebration.</i>

01:25:12.042 --> 01:25:15.834
<i>There's a celebration for birth
There's a celebration for marriage.</i>

01:25:15.959 --> 01:25:19.792
<i>But this is her
last celebration.</i>

01:25:19.917 --> 01:25:23.709
<i>There's a celebration for birth
There's a celebration for marriage.</i>

01:25:23.834 --> 01:25:27.709
<i>But this is her
last celebration.</i>

01:25:27.834 --> 01:25:31.792
<i>Come everyone, come all
Let's sing for Shula.</i>

01:25:31.917 --> 01:25:35.334
<i>This is the last celebration.</i>

01:25:36.042 --> 01:25:40.042
<i>Come everyone, come all
Let's sing for Shula.</i>

01:25:40.209 --> 01:25:44.042
<i>This is the last celebration...</i>
