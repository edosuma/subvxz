00:05.140 --> 00:08.871
<i>Stand, for all that is right</i>

00:08.943 --> 00:12.311
<i>Stand, when it's dark all around you</i>

00:12.381 --> 00:16.579
<i>You can be that shining light</i>

00:16.652 --> 00:19.246
<i>Stand, when troubles come calling</i>

00:19.321 --> 00:21.050
<i>For what you believe in</i>

00:21.123 --> 00:24.286
<i>Your gonna be all right</i>

00:24.359 --> 00:27.658
<i>Stand, just reach deep inside you</i>

00:27.729 --> 00:31.825
<i>And be that shining light</i>

00:31.900 --> 00:33.060
<i>Stand</i>

00:35.037 --> 00:36.265
Dad, that's awesome.

00:36.338 --> 00:37.703
That is the best song
you've ever written.

00:37.773 --> 00:39.764
I can't wait to record it.
What's the bad news?

00:39.842 --> 00:40.934
Bad news?

00:41.009 --> 00:43.034
What are you talking about?
It's a great song.

00:43.111 --> 00:45.671
Thank you, Lilly.
You know, I've always liked her.

00:45.747 --> 00:47.476
Don't change the subject.

00:47.549 --> 00:51.212
Every time he has bad news he tries
to soften it up with a great song.

00:51.286 --> 00:53.151
<i>Best of Both Worlds,</i>
I had to get braces.

00:53.222 --> 00:56.316
<i>This Is The Life,</i> Jackson decided
not to go to sleep away camp.

00:56.391 --> 00:58.985
<i>Pumpin' Up The Party,</i>
my goldfish died.

00:59.061 --> 01:02.326
When my goldfish died,
my mom flushed it down the toilet.

01:02.397 --> 01:04.661
I'll never forget her comforting words.

01:04.733 --> 01:07.429
"Get over it, Oliver, it's a stinking fish. "

01:08.503 --> 01:10.869
That explains so much.

01:10.939 --> 01:14.340
Come on, Dad, just tell me.
Trust me, I can handle it.

01:14.409 --> 01:17.708
Your cousin Luann is coming to visit.
Who wants pie?

01:20.515 --> 01:21.709
Miley?

01:22.985 --> 01:25.249
- Miley?
- What kind of pie?

01:27.422 --> 01:28.514
Come on, Mile.

01:28.590 --> 01:30.524
Don't forget that wonderful,
wonderful song

01:30.592 --> 01:32.457
that I just wrote you,
that you love so much.

01:32.527 --> 01:35.860
<i>Stand, for what you believe in</i>

01:35.931 --> 01:37.421
<i>Stand</i>

01:37.499 --> 01:39.899
When does her broomstick land?

01:39.968 --> 01:42.402
Come on now, Mile.
Now, let's don't start this again.

01:42.471 --> 01:43.665
She's a good kid.

01:43.739 --> 01:47.106
Let's not forget who pulled you
out of that well when you were just six.

01:47.175 --> 01:49.541
Let's not forget who pushed me in.

01:49.611 --> 01:51.238
Hey, that was an accident.

01:51.313 --> 01:54.077
Sometimes kids do stuff
without thinking.

01:57.719 --> 01:59.084
Got it.

01:59.154 --> 02:00.712
Stupid fly.

02:05.594 --> 02:08.062
I didn't plan that, but there you go.

02:08.130 --> 02:09.426
I can't believe this.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.398
Halloween is two days away
and you're making me

02:11.466 --> 02:13.559
share my bathroom
with the Princess of Darkness?

02:13.635 --> 02:16.229
If Luann's coming,
I'm sleeping over at Lilly's.

02:16.305 --> 02:17.397
Oh, come on, Mile.

02:17.472 --> 02:18.962
Now, listen, you guys have grown up.

02:19.041 --> 02:20.099
She's grown, you've grown,
you're a lot alike.

02:21.243 --> 02:22.267
How can you say that?

02:22.344 --> 02:25.313
I am nothing like that
horrible, ugly witch.

02:25.380 --> 02:26.574
Howdy, cuz!

02:28.150 --> 02:31.313
Well, doggies!
This is one humdinger of a shack!

02:49.404 --> 02:53.238

<i>Who would have thought</i>

03:01.516 --> 03:06.749
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

03:06.822 --> 03:10.781
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:10.859 --> 03:12.850
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

03:12.928 --> 03:14.589
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

03:14.663 --> 03:19.032
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:19.101 --> 03:20.659
<i>Mix it all together</i>

03:20.736 --> 03:23.637
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

03:29.644 --> 03:33.808
Uncle Robbie, Daddy said that these
were your favorite Halloween cookies.

03:33.882 --> 03:35.611
I made them myself.

03:36.651 --> 03:40.246
Pecan crunchies! Sweet nutty niblets.

03:41.823 --> 03:43.984
Hey, you churned your own butter,
didn't you?

03:44.059 --> 03:46.926
Is there any other way?

03:46.995 --> 03:50.624
- Whatever you do, don't eat that.
- Why not?

03:50.699 --> 03:54.601
Because it was made
by the devil's little helper.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.899
You are being ridiculous.

04:02.844 --> 04:05.711
- Lilly!
- Oh, please.

04:05.781 --> 04:07.180
Next you're gonna be saying,

04:07.249 --> 04:08.944
"She sees dead people. "

04:11.053 --> 04:14.420
You know, it's amazing
how much you and Miley look alike.

04:14.489 --> 04:15.956
Always have.

04:16.024 --> 04:19.721
When we were young'uns, you know,
before she was Hannah Montana,

04:19.795 --> 04:22.161
she was in the
Little Miss Tater pageant,

04:22.230 --> 04:25.063
but I had to take her place
before the talent part

04:25.133 --> 04:27.897
'cause she got all nervous and barfy.

04:27.969 --> 04:30.938
I wasn't nervous,
she slipped me some bad catfish.

04:31.006 --> 04:33.975
She's always been jealous of me
because I can sing and she can't.

04:34.042 --> 04:35.441
What'd she do for the talent?

04:37.379 --> 04:38.937
Pig calls.

04:41.316 --> 04:43.546
Man, I miss Tennessee.

04:43.618 --> 04:46.348
Boy, she cooks, she calls pigs.

04:46.421 --> 04:49.618
- Where have you been all my life?
- Oh, you.

04:49.691 --> 04:54.458
Mamma warned me
about you handsome Californy fellers.

04:54.529 --> 04:57.020
Oh, you, too.

04:59.401 --> 05:01.426
Didn't you say
you named your pet pig Luann?

05:01.503 --> 05:02.629
Yep.

05:06.408 --> 05:08.205
And now you know why.

05:12.948 --> 05:15.007
Oh, this is pathetic.

05:15.083 --> 05:18.075
Dad, every year we put up
the same stupid decorations

05:18.153 --> 05:19.643
and all my friends laugh at us.

05:19.721 --> 05:21.313
I don't know,
I think these are pretty gruesome.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.857
Look out, it's a spider!

05:23.925 --> 05:27.190
It's in your hair.
It's crawling in your ear.

05:27.262 --> 05:29.560
It's on your shoulder. Boo.

05:30.465 --> 05:32.092
Pathetic.

05:32.167 --> 05:34.294
Could we at least get
something halfway decent this year?

05:34.369 --> 05:36.997
I mean, our Christmas decorations
are scarier than this.

05:37.072 --> 05:38.835
Hey, just because
one of Santa's eyes fell out

05:38.907 --> 05:41.000
doesn't make him any less jolly.

05:43.078 --> 05:44.773
This stuff scares 6-year-olds.

05:44.846 --> 05:48.373
It's not like we're gonna find
something that scares us.

05:50.619 --> 05:53.747
Stewart, someone shoved
your magazines through my mail slot.

05:53.822 --> 05:54.811
Hmm.

05:54.890 --> 05:57.120
I'm guessing
that would be the mailman.

05:57.192 --> 05:59.422
What's with
the Halloween decorations?

05:59.494 --> 06:04.090
Or should I say
Hallo-weenie decorations?

06:07.969 --> 06:10.961
Your winking Santa
was scarier than this.

06:13.942 --> 06:17.901
You know, I was hoping this year
you'd be a little competition for me.

06:17.979 --> 06:19.537
But I was wrong.

06:19.614 --> 06:21.582
Dad, are you just gonna let him
get away with that?

06:21.650 --> 06:23.743
Don't worry about it, Son, it's a holiday.

06:23.818 --> 06:26.082
We're not gonna get
sucked into his little game.

06:26.154 --> 06:29.851
Said the loser!

06:29.925 --> 06:31.654
Don't go challenging me, Dontzig.

06:31.726 --> 06:32.715
Oh!

06:32.794 --> 06:34.887
I'm shaking.

06:34.963 --> 06:38.922
Well, take it outside.
I don't have earthquake insurance.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.195
Save the jokes, Goldilocks.

06:41.269 --> 06:42.668
You're gonna need a sense of humor

06:42.737 --> 06:46.571
when all the kids see
how "unscary" your house is

06:46.641 --> 06:49.405
and they start pelting it with eggs,

06:49.477 --> 06:52.378
which would be an improvement
over this paint job.

06:55.750 --> 06:59.743
That's it, he's crossed the line.
He insulted my hair.

06:59.821 --> 07:02.289
Get in the car, Son.
We're gonna put the "boo" in Malibu.

07:02.357 --> 07:03.415
Yes!

07:03.491 --> 07:05.925
It's gonna be a hair-raising experience.

07:11.533 --> 07:14.058
I don't know why you're making
such a big deal about your cousin.

07:14.135 --> 07:15.602
Luann seems really nice.

07:15.670 --> 07:19.197
Yeah, and a Venus flytrap
seems like a pretty plant

07:19.274 --> 07:20.901
until it throws you down a well.

07:20.976 --> 07:25.208
Trust me, underneath those
little piggy tails, little tiny horns.

07:26.248 --> 07:28.079
Okay, not to sound like your dad,

07:28.149 --> 07:30.549
but maybe you should
give her a chance, bud.

07:30.619 --> 07:31.813
Now, if you'll excuse me,

07:31.886 --> 07:35.151
I hear the ice cream truck a-ringing
and I want me a fudgie buddy.

07:36.324 --> 07:38.451
- Okay, that was creepy good.
- Thank you.

07:38.526 --> 07:41.927
Now, would it kill you to open up a little
and at least try to be friends with her?

07:41.997 --> 07:44.295
Hey, Traci's having that big
Halloween party tomorrow night.

07:44.366 --> 07:46.425
- Why don't we take her with us?
- No way.

07:46.501 --> 07:49.299
I ain't letting that pig calling,
butter churning, evil-doing hayseed

07:49.371 --> 07:50.895
anywhere near the Hannah world.

07:50.972 --> 07:53.805
Would you stop calling her names?

07:53.875 --> 07:59.108
Well, howdy, cuz. I found you
this pretty shell over by the tide pools.

07:59.848 --> 08:01.475
Yeah, pretty.

08:02.284 --> 08:05.185
A pretty good place
to hide a poisonous hermit crab.

08:08.323 --> 08:10.154
What are you doing?

08:10.225 --> 08:12.625
I'm ruining your "little plan"
to poison me

08:12.694 --> 08:14.662
and throw me down a well again!

08:14.729 --> 08:17.254
Miley, stop, there's nothing in there.

08:18.433 --> 08:21.061
I was just trying to be nice to y'all.

08:21.770 --> 08:23.260
See how clever she is?

08:23.338 --> 08:26.034
She tricks me into accusing her
of something that she didn't do

08:26.107 --> 08:27.734
so I would look stupid.

08:27.809 --> 08:30.903
Well, it worked. You look pretty stupid.

08:30.979 --> 08:34.210
I told you, she's an evil genius.

08:46.394 --> 08:48.385
Hey, Jackson.

08:48.463 --> 08:51.432
Oh, man, it's not scary enough.

08:51.499 --> 08:53.626
It needs something. But what?

08:54.602 --> 08:57.264
Think, think.

08:59.507 --> 09:01.099
Hey, Mile.

09:01.176 --> 09:03.303
What happened at the beach today
with you and Luann?

09:03.378 --> 09:05.608
She's up in the guest room,
she's awfully upset.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.307
Well, it could have something
to do with the fact

09:07.382 --> 09:09.282
that I accused her of trying to kill me.

09:09.351 --> 09:12.320
Yeah, that has been known
to offend a person.

09:13.254 --> 09:16.917
- Do you really think I'm being unfair?
- Yeah, I do, bud.

09:16.991 --> 09:19.221
But I also know
you're awfully good at fixing things

09:19.294 --> 09:21.489
when you put your mind to it.

09:22.597 --> 09:25.259
Okay, fine. I'll go talk to her.

09:26.568 --> 09:27.762
That's my girl.

09:27.836 --> 09:31.067
If I'm not down in 10 minutes,
check all the local wells.

09:36.945 --> 09:38.742
Luann, you okay?

09:38.813 --> 09:41.077
Yep, just packing up my bags

09:41.149 --> 09:44.175
and working on my plan
for world domination.

09:46.321 --> 09:50.621
Okay, look, maybe, possibly,

09:51.860 --> 09:56.058
it's conceivable that
I haven't treated you completely fairly.

09:56.131 --> 09:58.861
And I wanted to say I was sorry.

10:00.402 --> 10:02.199
- Really?
Yeah.

10:05.940 --> 10:09.467
The truth is,
I always was a little jealous.

10:09.544 --> 10:13.810
Well, I think it's time
that we took the past and buried it.

10:13.882 --> 10:18.546
Yeah, kind of like what we used to do
with Aunt Pearl's roadkill ravioli.

10:20.021 --> 10:23.149
Yeah.
There was always gravel in mine.

10:23.224 --> 10:26.591
Yeah, she said it gave it
that special crunch.

10:26.661 --> 10:28.925
Well, if you still want to stay,

10:28.997 --> 10:30.487
there's a really great
Hollywood Halloween party

10:30.565 --> 10:33.534
that I'd love to take you to.

10:33.601 --> 10:36.297
You really want me
to come with you'ins?

10:36.371 --> 10:39.534
I really want you to come with me-ins.

10:42.310 --> 10:43.777
I'm touched.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.581
Hey, the limo's here
to take us to Traci's party.

10:50.652 --> 10:52.381
- Are you ready?
- Oh, yeah. Let's do this.

10:52.454 --> 10:54.945
- Where's Luann?
- Oh, she can't go.

10:55.023 --> 10:58.083
She was at the beach boogie boarding
all day and got a really bad sunburn.

10:58.159 --> 11:00.491
Oh, I hate that.
But at least you two are friends now.

11:00.562 --> 11:03.190
- Yep, best of pals. Let's go.
- Okay.

11:03.264 --> 11:04.595
Oh, I forgot my purse.

11:04.666 --> 11:07.362
- I'll meet you out in the limo, okay?
- Okay.

11:11.673 --> 11:14.608
Miley, Miley, Miley.

11:14.676 --> 11:17.941
I can't believe
you didn't see this coming.

11:18.012 --> 11:21.175
Maybe if you wouldn't have
wasted your time in singing classes

11:21.249 --> 11:24.047
and went to rodeo camp
with the rest of us,

11:24.118 --> 11:27.417
you wouldn't be stuck in this situation.

11:29.324 --> 11:30.848
What's that, girl?

11:30.925 --> 11:33.985
You want Hannah
to perform at the party?

11:34.062 --> 11:35.859
Good idea.

11:35.930 --> 11:39.263
<i>You done got the best of both worlds</i>

11:39.367 --> 11:42.200
Oh, yeah. Horrible, ain't it?

11:42.270 --> 11:44.397
Wait till your fans hear that.

11:44.472 --> 11:47.566
That'll do wonders for your career.

11:49.444 --> 11:51.207
Happy Halloween, cuz.

11:58.753 --> 12:00.687
Trick or treat!

12:08.196 --> 12:10.494
Wait, kids, you forgot your candy!

12:10.565 --> 12:14.126
Yes! There is no way that
Dontzig's house is scarier than ours.

12:15.470 --> 12:17.028
What is wrong with you?

12:17.105 --> 12:20.597
You're supposed to hand out candy,
not traumatize my kid.

12:20.675 --> 12:24.338
I'm sorry. No, no, you don't understand.
See, it's just that...

12:24.445 --> 12:27.278
We're just trying to be as scary
as the guy next door.

12:27.348 --> 12:29.748
You mean Mr. Happy Pumpkin Man?

12:29.817 --> 12:32.718
- Who?
- Hey, hey, kids!

12:36.391 --> 12:39.360
Oh, is mean old Mr. Stewart
scaring you?

12:39.427 --> 12:41.327
Yeah!

12:41.396 --> 12:42.795
I don't believe this.

12:42.864 --> 12:46.163
Why would somebody
wanna scare little children?

12:46.234 --> 12:47.667
It's sick.

12:49.337 --> 12:50.497
I'm not surprised.

12:50.572 --> 12:53.336
At Christmas they put out
a one-eyed Santa.

12:53.408 --> 12:55.933
- No!
- It's true. I've seen it.

12:57.145 --> 13:01.809
But it's Halloween.
And you're in Mali-boo.

13:04.085 --> 13:06.417
Come on, kids.
Let's all go back to my house

13:06.487 --> 13:09.786
and everyone can have
another ride on the pony.

13:11.726 --> 13:15.787
<i>He's Mr. Happy Pumpkin man</i>

13:15.863 --> 13:18.423
<i>Giving out candy like no one can</i>

13:18.499 --> 13:24.131
<i>He's Mr. Happy Pumpkin man</i>

13:25.406 --> 13:28.273
Well, Stewarts, you win.

13:28.343 --> 13:29.640
You're the scariest.

13:29.711 --> 13:32.578
And everybody in the neighborhood
hates you.

13:32.647 --> 13:34.137
I got you!

13:35.717 --> 13:38.083
<i>I'm Mr. Happy Pumpkin man</i>

13:38.152 --> 13:40.052
Wait up, kids! I'm sorry.

13:40.121 --> 13:43.090
Hey, hey!
Don't forget your candy!

13:43.157 --> 13:46.388
Get away from our children!
I've got pepper spray!

13:47.528 --> 13:48.893
Dad?

13:48.963 --> 13:50.328
Jackson?

13:52.767 --> 13:56.567
Oliver, I need your mom
to drive me to a Halloween party now!

13:57.972 --> 13:59.667
Yes, you can come.

14:05.647 --> 14:08.377
I can't believe Luann would tie you up
and try to ruin your life.

14:09.550 --> 14:10.983
You know, this is gonna make

14:11.052 --> 14:14.180
my date tomorrow night with her
a little awkward.

14:16.357 --> 14:17.915
What are you gonna do
when you see her?

14:17.992 --> 14:20.517
I'm gonna rip off her wig
and punch her in the nose.

14:20.595 --> 14:23.462
Right now just help me find her.
It's not gonna be that hard.

14:23.531 --> 14:27.729
Come on, she's gonna be the only one
in there that looks exactly like me.

14:27.802 --> 14:30.032
<i></i>

14:31.839 --> 14:33.067
Oh, boy.

14:34.842 --> 14:38.278
Yeah, this is gonna be
a little harder than I thought.

14:40.581 --> 14:42.173
<i></i>

14:42.517 --> 14:46.886
Oh, boy, these gummy ghouls are
better than Pappy's mountain taffy!

14:48.022 --> 14:49.785
Man, you've been hanging around
your cousin so much

14:49.857 --> 14:51.791
you're starting to talk like her.

14:51.859 --> 14:54.623
Stop loading up on candy.
People are watching.

14:54.696 --> 14:58.496
Well, of course they are. I'm a celebrity.

14:59.667 --> 15:00.964
Hannah.

15:03.871 --> 15:05.498
You've been here an hour

15:05.573 --> 15:09.532
and you haven't said a word
about my little Hannah-ween surprise.

15:09.610 --> 15:11.874
Oh, you mean everyone
dressed like me?

15:11.946 --> 15:13.174
Yeah, it's about as stupid

15:13.247 --> 15:16.705
as a vegetarian having breakfast
at the Beef N' Waffle.

15:17.752 --> 15:20.653
What are you talking about?

15:20.722 --> 15:25.750
I'm talking about stupid.
Just like your stupid little voice.

15:25.827 --> 15:29.991
What's the matter, you got some
candy corn stuck up in your nozzle?

15:30.665 --> 15:33.691
I have a deviated septum.

15:33.768 --> 15:35.929
And I own it.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.334
What is wrong with you?

15:37.405 --> 15:38.963
You've been acting weird
since we got here.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.564
It's like you want the whole party
to hate you...

15:40.641 --> 15:42.609
Oh, my gosh, you're Luann!

15:42.677 --> 15:46.044
Well, it took you long enough, Lulu.

15:46.881 --> 15:48.371
It's Lola.

15:49.717 --> 15:54.745
Lilly, Lola, Lulu,
you might as well go by Purple Head.

15:56.657 --> 16:00.991
What do you use for conditioner,
grape jelly?

16:01.062 --> 16:02.757
Hey, waiter.

16:02.830 --> 16:06.391
Fetch me some peanut butter,
I'd like to make me a sandwich.

16:09.303 --> 16:11.897
I gotta get you out of here
before you blow Miley's secret.

16:11.973 --> 16:14.669
Well, shut my mouth.

16:14.742 --> 16:18.178
I wasn't even thinking
about pulling this wig off

16:18.246 --> 16:20.373
till you done brought it up.

16:20.448 --> 16:23.212
That'll really fix her wagon.

16:23.284 --> 16:25.013
Good job, gumdrop.

16:30.124 --> 16:32.991
I had a dream like this once.

16:33.060 --> 16:36.052
Except the room
was full of Jessica Simpsons

16:36.130 --> 16:38.792
and I had more than one chest hair.

16:38.866 --> 16:42.427
Focus.
We have to find the real fake Hannah.

16:43.571 --> 16:44.595
Ha!

16:44.672 --> 16:45.764
I've got you!

16:45.840 --> 16:47.899
I am not gonna let you ruin
my best friend's life.

16:47.975 --> 16:49.602
I am your best friend.

16:49.677 --> 16:51.804
You can't fool me
with that fake Miley accent.

16:51.879 --> 16:55.178
I am Miley! I have to go find Luann!

16:55.249 --> 16:56.648
You're not going anywhere
without your nose.

16:57.819 --> 17:00.310
Lilly. Lilly, she's telling the truth.

17:00.388 --> 17:02.015
Oliver? What are you doing here?

17:02.089 --> 17:03.716
I needed
his mom to drive me here

17:03.791 --> 17:06.624
'cause you and Luann
rode off in my limo!

17:07.895 --> 17:10.454
- Miley?
- You think?

17:10.531 --> 17:12.556
Sorry. We gotta find her quick.

17:12.633 --> 17:15.363
She's about to rip off her wig
and blow your secret.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.529
- She wouldn't.
- She would.

17:17.605 --> 17:20.130
And she thought of it all herself.

17:21.342 --> 17:25.438
Remember, no matter what she says,
she's evil.

17:27.381 --> 17:29.508
Looking for Hannah.

17:29.584 --> 17:30.778
Not you.

17:31.285 --> 17:33.310
Not you. But, hi.

17:35.523 --> 17:39.653
Not you, but, girl, aren't you styling.

17:39.727 --> 17:43.823
<i>Hey, folks, it's me,</i>
<i>the real Hannah Montana!</i>

17:43.898 --> 17:45.456
<i>I've got a little announcement for y'all. </i>

17:45.533 --> 17:46.693
<i>You guys might want to get out</i>

17:46.767 --> 17:50.635
<i>your fancy Hollywood phone cameras</i>
<i>for this one. </i>

17:50.705 --> 17:54.505
Hey, guys, I found her! She's on stage!

17:54.575 --> 17:55.735
Good work.

17:56.377 --> 17:59.107
<i>Hold on, guys, I got</i>
<i>a little something stuck in my craw. </i>

18:04.952 --> 18:06.351
<i>Bingo!</i>

18:06.921 --> 18:09.287
Well, she's gonna have
a real hard time spitting

18:09.357 --> 18:10.824
with my fist in her mouth.

18:10.892 --> 18:12.154
You can't!

18:12.226 --> 18:15.684
You get into something with her,
she might rip off your wig, too.

18:15.763 --> 18:19.722
Have no fear, ladies,
the masked musketeer has a plan.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.290
Great.

18:21.369 --> 18:24.236
My life is in the hands
of Count Chesthair.

18:26.407 --> 18:27.999
<i>So, lookie here,</i>

18:28.075 --> 18:31.602
<i>y'all are about to see something</i>
<i>you never expected to see,</i>

18:31.679 --> 18:35.877
<i>the other side, the other side,</i>
<i>the other side of... </i>

18:45.559 --> 18:47.117
<i>Look at that. </i>

18:47.194 --> 18:48.684
<i>Magic. </i>

18:48.763 --> 18:52.028
<i>And spitting. Neat. </i>

18:52.099 --> 18:53.896
<i>Why don't we have dessert now?</i>

18:53.968 --> 18:56.630
<i>Bring out the</i>
<i>Hannah banana cream pie!</i>

18:59.006 --> 19:00.769
You are so busted, Luann.

19:00.841 --> 19:03.036
Guys, you grabbed
the wrong one in the dark!

19:03.110 --> 19:04.441
I'm Miley!

19:05.413 --> 19:08.280
Nice try, you backwoods witch.
These are my best friends.

19:08.349 --> 19:11.079
They're not gonna fall for that. Tell her.

19:12.553 --> 19:14.714
- You got any idea?
- Not a clue.

19:16.991 --> 19:18.891
Guys, we have got to
get her out of here

19:18.960 --> 19:20.860
before she reveals my secret.

19:20.928 --> 19:22.520
You mean my secret.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.188
Wait a minute. I have an idea.

19:24.265 --> 19:26.165
I know how to tell
which is the real Miley.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.133
- Both of you kiss me.
- Okay.

19:29.270 --> 19:30.601
That's Miley.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.905
And what has all this taught you?

19:38.980 --> 19:40.675
That parents should believe their kids

19:40.748 --> 19:43.546
when they tell them
their cousins are evil.

19:43.617 --> 19:45.016
And?

19:45.086 --> 19:47.987
That I should always take
my cell phone when I leave the house

19:48.055 --> 19:51.513
in case my daughter
gets tied up in her closet.

19:51.592 --> 19:54.356
- And?
- I'm sorry.

19:54.428 --> 19:56.726
But you don't have to
worry about it much longer.

19:56.797 --> 19:58.731
Your uncle's on his way here
to pick Luann up.

19:58.799 --> 20:00.130
They'll be gone tomorrow.

20:00.201 --> 20:02.692
That doesn't give me much time
to get her back.

20:02.770 --> 20:04.431
Like I've always told you,

20:04.505 --> 20:07.269
an eye for an eye
makes the whole world blind.

20:07.341 --> 20:12.108
Stewart! Stewart, you gotta help me!

20:12.179 --> 20:16.616
Those candy grabbers are like piranha!
They're coming by the bus load!

20:16.684 --> 20:19.414
It's like someone
put an ad in the paper.

20:19.487 --> 20:22.115
The paper? That's way too slow.

20:22.189 --> 20:24.453
If somebody wanted
to get information out fast,

20:24.525 --> 20:28.154
they'd just run down
Pacific Coast Highway with a bullhorn.

20:29.230 --> 20:30.629
You didn't.

20:32.767 --> 20:34.496
<i>Oh, yes, I did. </i>

20:35.836 --> 20:37.133
<i>Got you!</i>

20:38.039 --> 20:41.907
<i>Okay, kids. </i>
<i>Come on down, don't be shy. </i>

20:42.910 --> 20:46.539
Curse you, Stewart! Curse you!

20:48.783 --> 20:50.910
Dad, what about revenge
making the whole world blind?

20:50.985 --> 20:54.148
I was teaching that to you,
it's too late for me.

20:57.124 --> 20:59.684
Hey, Dad,
Dontzig's pony followed me home.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.125
Can we keep him?

21:01.195 --> 21:04.926
Please?
All I need is a really big litter box.

21:07.435 --> 21:10.302
I'm just gonna take him up
to my room, okay?

21:13.474 --> 21:17.376
Hey, Miley, tell your cousin
her daddy's here!

21:17.445 --> 21:21.677
Put your drawers on, Robbie Ray,
your brother's here!

21:21.749 --> 21:24.149
Good to see you, too, Bobbie Ray.

21:24.785 --> 21:27.310
Well, smack my goat
and call me stupid,

21:27.388 --> 21:30.983
this sure is one humdinger of a shack
you got yourself.

21:31.058 --> 21:34.118
Stewart, I need that pony back,
it's a rental.

21:34.195 --> 21:36.129
Hey. Hey.

21:36.197 --> 21:38.563
Hey. Two Stewarts!

21:47.308 --> 21:50.368
Is that that pain-in-the-keister neighbor
you've been telling me about?

21:50.444 --> 21:51.502
Yep.

21:51.579 --> 21:54.309
- He sure runs fast, don't he?
- He sure does.

21:54.381 --> 21:56.281
- Doggies!
- Doggies!
