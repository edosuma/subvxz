00:00.760 --> 00:04.220
Before there was sex,
before there was the city,

00:04.255 --> 00:07.560
there was just me-Carrie.
Carrie Bradshaw.

00:07.570 --> 00:09.290
And lots of things were changing...

00:09.325 --> 00:10.075
For all of us.

00:10.110 --> 00:12.340
Mouse. I figured you'd be enjoying
your spring break

00:12.375 --> 00:14.105
now that you're not team manager anymore.

00:14.140 --> 00:16.990
Sorry about that.
And i'm sorry to see you go.

00:17.025 --> 00:18.220
You gonna miss me?

00:18.420 --> 00:19.680
No way.

00:20.670 --> 00:21.885
Maybe.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.350
I don't even know your name,

00:23.420 --> 00:27.110
but you might be the most annoying woman
i have ever met.

00:27.230 --> 00:29.290
- I'm Deb.
- Tom.

00:30.060 --> 00:32.540
- Have anyone ever kissed you, Dorrit?
- No.

00:32.575 --> 00:34.685
- Can i be the first?
- Yes.

00:34.720 --> 00:37.175
- I'm here for you, Carrie.
- I know. Just...

00:37.210 --> 00:39.630
All i can think in my head is,
"For how long?"

00:39.665 --> 00:41.210
I know i don't say it
as much as you do,

00:41.245 --> 00:43.000
But i'm kinda terrified, too.

00:48.070 --> 00:50.150
A lot of things
are out of our control,

00:50.185 --> 00:52.230
like what number comes up on the dice.

00:52.265 --> 00:53.095
But if you're lucky,

00:53.130 --> 00:55.430
you get to choose
what direction you go in.

00:55.500 --> 00:59.060
Mm. Pink-entertainment?
Or green-science & nature?

00:59.130 --> 01:01.510
Hmm. Which should i choose?

01:01.530 --> 01:03.360
I know which color you're gonna pick.

01:03.720 --> 01:06.550
You think i'm gonna choose pink
because it's a pretty color.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.750
And because i know
everything there is to know

01:08.785 --> 01:10.800
about everything related
to movies and television.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.020
If it was a "Love boat" question,
i would crush it.

01:13.055 --> 01:14.090
But...

01:14.530 --> 01:16.940
I'm not afraid of
a little science & nature.

01:16.975 --> 01:18.245
I like a challenge.

01:18.280 --> 01:20.730
Always keeping me on my toes,
huh, Bradshaw?

01:20.765 --> 01:22.340
Well, that's the plan, Kydd.

01:22.550 --> 01:23.810
Well, it's working.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.560
I love you, Carrie Bradshaw.

01:32.980 --> 01:34.450
I wanna have sex with you.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074

01:43.030 --> 01:44.480
What was i thinking?!

01:44.530 --> 01:46.095
Um... going with you weren't.

01:46.130 --> 01:49.000
I don't know what happened.
My mind was saying,

01:49.035 --> 01:50.435
"I love you, too, Sebastian Kydd,"

01:50.470 --> 01:52.945
and then my mouth was all,
"Let's do the nasty. "

01:52.980 --> 01:55.420
It's like i lost total control
of my verbal synapses.

01:55.455 --> 01:57.245
Well, it's not the worst case scenario.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.660
You know, i'm guessing most guys
would be pretty psyched

01:59.695 --> 02:02.000
to know they're gonna get... to do it.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.075
Was he psyched?

02:03.110 --> 02:05.595
I think so.
I mean, he seemed pretty happy about it.

02:05.630 --> 02:08.340
But it pretty much obliterated
the whole "I love you" thing.

02:08.375 --> 02:09.985
I can't believe i did that.

02:10.020 --> 02:12.840
I mean, i have dreamt
of my first "I love you"-

02:12.850 --> 02:15.035
when the guy would say it,
who would it be?

02:15.070 --> 02:17.980
I mean, i imagined my first
"I love you" would be perfect,

02:17.990 --> 02:20.000
and now i don't have to imagine it anymore.

02:20.035 --> 02:21.370
Apparently, i don't say it back.

02:21.405 --> 02:23.240
There's still time, Carrie.

02:23.470 --> 02:25.480
But i ruined the perfect.

02:25.515 --> 02:26.380
Do you not love him?

02:26.415 --> 02:27.860
No, i do.

02:27.900 --> 02:30.260
I am in love with Sebastian Kydd.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.450
Do you want to have sex with him?

02:33.580 --> 02:35.215
- Yes.
- Oh, my god.

02:35.250 --> 02:37.015
And i can tell him that i love him

02:37.050 --> 02:38.930
when we're together for the first time,

02:38.965 --> 02:40.810
and that will make it even more perfect.

02:51.790 --> 02:53.930
- Why can't he leave me alone?
- I don't understand.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.190
I thought he was all flirty with you.

02:55.225 --> 02:57.780
He is. He's nothing but flirty.

02:57.815 --> 02:59.330
I hate flirty.

02:59.540 --> 03:01.865
He's just flirting with me
to get in my head,

03:01.900 --> 03:04.155
screw up my grades,
and get into Harvard over me.

03:04.190 --> 03:06.960
Okay, your brain is broken.
That is the only explanation.

03:06.995 --> 03:09.730
This is isn't my first day
at the college admissions rodeo.

03:09.820 --> 03:11.560
He's got good grades and sports

03:11.595 --> 03:13.300
and he's annoyingly good-looking.

03:13.580 --> 03:15.910
But he has a weakness. A big one.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.125
I'm afraid to ask.

03:17.160 --> 03:19.250
Minimal extracurricular activities

03:19.285 --> 03:21.697
and president of no clubs.

03:21.732 --> 03:24.110
He's a sheep, not a leader!

03:24.145 --> 03:25.240
I'm a leader.

03:25.250 --> 03:27.540
I've already joined and run
for president of eight clubs.

03:27.550 --> 03:29.560
This week, i'm taking the rest.

03:29.770 --> 03:32.020
- That sounds horrible.
- Exactly!

03:32.410 --> 03:35.300
Which is why i'm sure to land officer
roles in all of them.

03:35.335 --> 03:37.680
And while i'm busy attending
all my meetings,

03:37.715 --> 03:38.915
I can also be avoiding

03:38.950 --> 03:42.830
that totally hot but duplicitous West.

03:42.870 --> 03:45.640
Looks like you've got
everything under control.

03:45.675 --> 03:46.900
I do!

03:52.470 --> 03:53.990
- Got it!
- I've got it!

03:54.960 --> 03:56.800
Dad, no one ever calls for you!

03:56.835 --> 03:57.850
Hello?

03:58.720 --> 03:59.800
Hello.

03:59.810 --> 04:01.540
Um... it's for me.

04:01.550 --> 04:03.600
Well, goody for you,
but i'm waiting for a call.

04:03.635 --> 04:05.585
Well, that's why we have call waiting.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.740
So if someone calls for you,
i will let you know.

04:07.775 --> 04:09.680
But since... this is a work call,

04:09.690 --> 04:10.765
it takes precedent.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.570
Whatever. I'm outta here.

04:13.950 --> 04:14.675
Where you off to?

04:14.710 --> 04:17.410
The mall. Maybe check out
some records or somethin'.

04:18.899 --> 04:21.075
Deb?
Hey. Sorry.

04:21.110 --> 04:23.220
That's okay.
I don't mind waiting.

04:23.240 --> 04:26.280
And i don't mind being called a work call.

04:26.390 --> 04:28.690
My ex-husband used to say
i was a lot of work.

04:28.725 --> 04:30.370
Don't let that scare ya.

04:30.930 --> 04:31.735
It doesn't.

04:31.770 --> 04:33.265
Uh, but i'm-i'm sorry about that.

04:33.300 --> 04:35.540
It's just that my kids don't really know
that i'm dating yet.

04:35.575 --> 04:38.230
- That's okay, right?
- Oh, we are dating now?

04:38.890 --> 04:41.910
Oh, is that-is that...
not what i should call this?

04:41.945 --> 04:43.830
I'm j-i don't really know
how all this works.

04:43.865 --> 04:45.697
I mean, we made out in your car

04:45.732 --> 04:47.495
and got coffee a couple times.

04:47.530 --> 04:50.230
Yeah, sorry. I'm a little rusty.
What would you call that?

04:50.450 --> 04:51.405
Dating.

04:51.440 --> 04:53.220
I'm just messing with you.

04:55.130 --> 04:56.790
I'm an easy target, aren't i?

04:57.260 --> 04:59.020
I would say just right.

05:00.140 --> 05:01.845
I'd like to see you again.

05:01.880 --> 05:03.515
I was thinking the same.

05:03.550 --> 05:06.660
Uh... maybe you could come over here
for a nightcap?

05:06.750 --> 05:07.500
A nightcap?

05:07.510 --> 05:11.040
Yeah.
You know, to put a cap on the night.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.410
I thought it'd be fun.

05:12.700 --> 05:13.990
Say Friday night?

05:16.170 --> 05:18.080
I gotta pick Dorrit up
from a school thing.

05:18.115 --> 05:19.080
Hey, what about Saturday night?

05:19.115 --> 05:20.455
Ugh. I have my son.

05:20.490 --> 05:23.430
- Sunday?
- We do a family dinner.

05:23.465 --> 05:25.515
Ooh. Weekdays are tough.

05:25.550 --> 05:27.120
What about, uh, next Friday night?

05:27.155 --> 05:29.370
Um... yes!

05:29.580 --> 05:30.760
That will work.

05:30.770 --> 05:32.710
A nightcap next Friday night.

05:32.730 --> 05:33.615
That sounds great.

05:33.650 --> 05:35.870
I'll see you then. Oh, and Tom?

05:36.270 --> 05:37.320
Come prepared.

05:37.355 --> 05:38.460
I will.

05:45.710 --> 05:48.115
I... will come prepared.

05:48.150 --> 05:51.200
And while my dad suddenly felt
like he had a lot to learn,

05:51.360 --> 05:54.610
my sister had apparently signed up
to learn everything.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.620
The book is so creepy.
I loved it.

05:56.655 --> 05:58.125
I knew you would.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.500
And i can't believe that's
what they thought it'd be like now.

06:00.535 --> 06:02.665
I mean, 1984 was just last year.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.870
If you think about it,
it's not that far off

06:04.905 --> 06:06.460
with Reagan in the White House.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.370
They want to control everything.

06:09.890 --> 06:11.400
I never thought about it that way.

06:12.990 --> 06:15.430
You make me look at the world
totally different, Miller.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.340
Like i'm seeing it for the first time.

06:17.950 --> 06:21.000
All these books...
I finally feel like i know stuff.

06:25.570 --> 06:27.560
You've always known stuff, Dorrit.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.770
I can see it in your eyes.

06:29.805 --> 06:31.620
You know pain.
You're deep.

06:32.460 --> 06:35.430
That's why you hide behind
all that makeup and those clothes.

06:35.465 --> 06:36.455
It's like the armor you wear

06:36.490 --> 06:38.700
'cause you know there's stuff
out there to be scared of.

06:38.735 --> 06:41.870
I'm not afraid,
especially when i'm with you.

06:44.490 --> 06:46.600
I wear all this crap to piss my dad off.

06:46.750 --> 06:47.535
But i gotta be honest-

06:47.570 --> 06:49.580
It doesn't even seem to shock him anymore.

06:49.870 --> 06:52.170
What's the fun in rebelling
if nobody notices?

06:52.205 --> 06:54.295
I think the best version of rebellion

06:54.330 --> 06:57.820
is to become someone who people
don't even realize is rebelling.

07:02.190 --> 07:05.410
Mm! Talk about a woman
who knows how to rebel.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.580
I mean, she makes a wedding dress

07:07.615 --> 07:09.645
look positively perverted. Mm!

07:09.680 --> 07:11.590
I never even wanted
to wear a wedding dress

07:11.625 --> 07:13.185
until i saw her in this one.

07:13.220 --> 07:15.470
Netted stockings and a veil?
Yes, please.

07:15.505 --> 07:17.720
I went to a few rehearsals
for her concert.

07:17.970 --> 07:20.800
Her faux fornication is divine.

07:20.820 --> 07:22.550
Wait. Was this for "The virgin tour"?

07:22.585 --> 07:23.425
Exactement.

07:23.460 --> 07:25.460
We're gonna do a section of the magazine

07:25.495 --> 07:27.195
dedicated to "The virgin tour"-

07:27.230 --> 07:29.500
As if there are any of those
in the world anymore.

07:29.670 --> 07:31.960
Virginity is so over.

07:32.140 --> 07:34.350
Well, it can only be over
if it's there in the first place.

07:34.385 --> 07:35.935
So... not over for everyone.

07:35.970 --> 07:37.920
You are very wise, Carrie Bradshaw.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.750
Anywho, she's launching
the tour in Seattle,

07:40.785 --> 07:43.240
but having the big launch party here,

07:43.280 --> 07:45.805
because no one actually lives in Seattle.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.165
I wonder why she's even doing a concert there.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.920
Now the party's gonna be
at the Oak Room at the Plaza.

07:50.955 --> 07:52.892
- Very old school.
- That sounds amazing.

07:52.927 --> 07:54.795
It won't all be fun and games,
my sweets.

07:54.830 --> 07:57.380
We're all gonna be getting quotes
from the people involved in the show.

07:57.415 --> 07:59.770
Andy wants to do a big
behind-the-scenes thing-

07:59.805 --> 08:01.700
How the tour came together,
the costumes,

08:01.735 --> 08:03.360
the lighting, the dancing.

08:03.830 --> 08:06.020
"The material that made the material girl. "

08:06.055 --> 08:08.590
Ohh! I am so gonna steal that!

08:09.170 --> 08:11.310
I can't believe we get to talk
about Madonna

08:11.345 --> 08:12.555
as, like, a person.

08:12.590 --> 08:14.540
Wait till you see her. She is...

08:14.740 --> 08:15.930
amazing.

08:16.190 --> 08:18.980
Not the greatest voice, but, mnh.
Who cares?

08:19.015 --> 08:20.817
She has got that je ne sais quoi.

08:20.852 --> 08:22.620
Wait. Do i get to go to the party?

08:22.630 --> 08:24.835
Honey, i've known Ms. Ciccone for years.

08:24.870 --> 08:27.040
I used to let her
in the back of Danceteria

08:27.075 --> 08:28.150
when she couldn't afford the cover.

08:28.185 --> 08:29.545
She bloody owes me.

08:29.580 --> 08:31.910
Oh, and bring that gorgeous boy
of yours if you want.

08:32.380 --> 08:34.424
Madonna loves eye candy.

08:34.460 --> 08:36.580
It'll be a magical night,
not to be missed.

08:36.615 --> 08:38.700
Some might even call it a perfect night.

08:40.210 --> 08:41.005
What?

08:41.039 --> 08:42.380
What do you mean what?

08:42.429 --> 08:43.850
You've got that look-

08:43.870 --> 08:45.345
some would even call it a gleam-

08:45.380 --> 08:47.480
like you've got something to say to me.

08:47.515 --> 08:49.580
Oh, i have many things to say to you.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.840
Oh, you do, huh?

08:54.280 --> 08:57.300
This Friday, Madonna's having
an exclusive kickoff party

08:57.335 --> 08:58.295
for her "Virgin tour. "

08:58.330 --> 08:59.880
Oh. It's a party conversation.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.420
Madonna's party.

09:01.650 --> 09:03.290
And Larissa gave me two tickets.

09:03.325 --> 09:05.030
One for me, one for you.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.670
I was thinking
we could make a night of it.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.390
I'm starting to get the picture.

09:09.425 --> 09:10.980
Maybe even spend the night...

09:10.990 --> 09:12.690
in a hotel room in the city?

09:13.260 --> 09:14.345
Maybe the St. Regis?

09:14.380 --> 09:16.540
Well, i was gonna say "Together,"

09:16.575 --> 09:18.700
but that sounds even more perfect.

09:26.710 --> 09:27.820
Get a room.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.660
Don't worry. I am.

09:30.710 --> 09:33.280
Madonna's song might be called "Like a virgin,"

09:33.430 --> 09:36.210
but after the party,
i knew i wouldn't be.

09:40.890 --> 09:43.440
The plans for my perfect evening
were in place,

09:43.475 --> 09:44.635
but as a teenager,

09:44.670 --> 09:46.680
my life wasn't entirely in my control.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.010
I still had to get permission.

09:50.150 --> 09:50.995
Hey, dad.

09:51.030 --> 09:54.180
So Larissa invited me to party
in the city on Friday.

09:54.820 --> 09:56.285
Uh, sort of a work thing.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.485
So i was going to ask Mouse to come

09:58.520 --> 10:00.650
and then crash at her place afterwards.

10:00.685 --> 10:01.575
Where is this party?

10:01.610 --> 10:03.500
The Oak Room at the Plaza.

10:04.300 --> 10:05.810
Oh, that should be nice.

10:06.990 --> 10:08.780
I guess Dorrit is sleeping over
at Audrey's,

10:08.815 --> 10:12.360
so i'll just... be here by my lonesome.

10:12.560 --> 10:15.930
You, uh... don't want me
to cancel my plans, do you?

10:15.965 --> 10:17.045
No, no. No. No.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.080
Um, i just-do you know what time
you might be getting back

10:20.115 --> 10:20.720
in the morning?

10:20.730 --> 10:23.250
I mean, i just wanna know
if you're gonna need breakfast.

10:23.285 --> 10:24.930
Or i was thinking about
maybe getting up early

10:24.965 --> 10:26.480
and going to the gym or something.

10:28.980 --> 10:33.600
Um... no, i definitely think
i'm going to want to sleep in.

10:34.610 --> 10:36.960
- So work out away.
- Okay. I will.

10:36.995 --> 10:39.160
I will work out away.

10:42.530 --> 10:44.680
Dorrit, you look nice.

10:45.660 --> 10:47.860
Whatever. I don't need your approval.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.160
What was that about?

10:52.190 --> 10:53.320
I don't know.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.180
But i was pretty sure i did.

10:59.980 --> 11:01.450
Try knocking next time.

11:01.610 --> 11:02.710
Sorry.

11:03.170 --> 11:04.230
Can i come in?

11:04.460 --> 11:06.090
Can't stop you from being here.

11:06.700 --> 11:10.090
So... how's it going with the boy
you've been seeing?

11:10.720 --> 11:11.750
What boy?

11:11.930 --> 11:15.880
And i don't see boys.
I'm not a loser or a kid.

11:16.770 --> 11:17.505
I'm 15, you know.

11:17.540 --> 11:20.400
I know. You're allowed to hang out
with whoever you want.

11:20.770 --> 11:23.560
I'm just trying to be friendly, Dorrit.

11:23.595 --> 11:26.350
Don't bother.
And his name's Miller.

11:26.560 --> 11:27.840
So it is a guy.

11:28.230 --> 11:30.970
It must be, if you're dressing
and looking like this.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.310
Whatever.
Can i have the bathroom back now?

11:33.345 --> 11:35.332
Sure. I'm happy for you, Dorrit.

11:35.367 --> 11:37.320
Why? 'cause someone likes me?

11:37.460 --> 11:39.520
People do that all over the world.
It's no big deal.

11:39.555 --> 11:42.030
Well, it is if you like him back.

11:42.180 --> 11:43.635
I just wanna make sure
you don't feel like

11:43.670 --> 11:45.590
you don't have to change
who you are for a guy.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.770
I'm not changing anything.

11:46.805 --> 11:49.255
Good. Because as much

11:49.290 --> 11:52.480
as i like seeing you not look
like the handmaiden of Death,

11:52.780 --> 11:54.455
he should like you for who you are,

11:54.490 --> 11:56.255
not for who he wants you to be.

11:56.290 --> 11:57.985
No offense, Miss goody-two-shoes,

11:58.020 --> 12:00.365
but i'm not taking advice from a person

12:00.400 --> 12:02.710
who took, like, 47 years to kiss a guy.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.075
As everyone knows, back in March,

12:08.110 --> 12:10.020
U.S.A. for Africa released
their hit single,

12:10.055 --> 12:11.045
"We are the world. "

12:11.080 --> 12:12.765
Now as far as i'm concerned,

12:12.800 --> 12:14.970
charity and helping others
shouldn't need a music video

12:15.005 --> 12:15.960
to be cool.

12:16.610 --> 12:18.760
Sorry i'm late. Practice ran over.

12:18.970 --> 12:20.430
Well, you should dribble right back out of here.

12:20.465 --> 12:21.275
We have work to do.

12:21.310 --> 12:23.940
If we're not watching the video,
then what are we doing here?

12:25.620 --> 12:28.185
We are prepping boxes of chocolate bars

12:28.220 --> 12:30.905
to raise money to help fight faminen Africa.

12:30.940 --> 12:34.870
No video and we get to box up candy bars?
Awesome!

12:35.470 --> 12:36.600
Psych.

12:36.730 --> 12:39.510
Come on. All this famine talk-
i'm totally starving.

12:39.710 --> 12:41.520
Wait. Don't go.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.520
We have a ton of chocolate to work with here.

12:48.070 --> 12:50.530
I'll give out a few free ones if you stay!

12:52.430 --> 12:53.505
If we work together,

12:53.540 --> 12:55.430
I'll bet we'll be able
to get all those candy bars sorted

12:55.465 --> 12:56.800
in a couple of hours.

13:00.310 --> 13:02.340
While Mouse's day was going south,

13:03.420 --> 13:05.570
my night was going south as well...

13:06.440 --> 13:07.680
to Manhattan.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.230
Are you excited?

13:10.265 --> 13:11.540
Of course. You?

13:11.810 --> 13:13.010
Definitely.

13:13.220 --> 13:15.070
Lot of things are gonna happen tonight.

13:15.370 --> 13:17.100
You know, we're gonna do and say things

13:17.135 --> 13:18.540
we haven't done or said before.

13:18.550 --> 13:20.140
Well, i mean,
some of us have said stuff,

13:20.175 --> 13:21.745
but you know what i mean.

13:21.780 --> 13:23.980
It's gonna be great. I promise.

13:24.850 --> 13:25.930
I know.

13:25.940 --> 13:27.360
I just wish we were driving
into the city

13:27.395 --> 13:28.647
instead of taking the train.

13:28.682 --> 13:29.865
I miss being in control.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.270
Yeah, but this way,
we don't have to worry

13:31.305 --> 13:32.930
about parking overnight.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.630
And we can hold hands.

13:36.660 --> 13:38.220
Now i'm glad we didn't drive.

13:41.300 --> 13:42.600
And there it was-

13:42.930 --> 13:44.730
The moment i was looking for,

13:44.980 --> 13:46.780
to tell him how i felt.

13:47.430 --> 13:48.720
Sebastian...

13:51.190 --> 13:52.400
Tickets, please.

13:53.790 --> 13:56.830
And just like that, my moment was gone.

14:00.830 --> 14:02.050
What'd you wanna tell me?

14:02.100 --> 14:03.770
Uh, it can wait.

14:04.980 --> 14:07.480
My perfect moment wasn't going to be here,

14:07.760 --> 14:09.035
but i wasn't worried.

14:09.070 --> 14:10.660
It was going to be a long night.

14:10.695 --> 14:12.080
I'd get other chances...

14:13.720 --> 14:14.900
I hoped.

14:29.820 --> 14:31.450
This place is awesome.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.645
Yawn. It used to be.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.800
Now the only place
that is anyplace in here

14:35.835 --> 14:36.625
is the V.I.P. area.

14:36.660 --> 14:39.035
She's right.
That's where the real party is.

14:39.070 --> 14:42.190
All this-fake party.
People who wish they were V.I.P.s.

14:42.225 --> 14:44.100
Don't you even dare
think about partying.

14:44.110 --> 14:46.255
- We are here for work.
- Of course we are.

14:46.290 --> 14:48.400
Now let's get a drink,
and make mine a double.

14:49.070 --> 14:51.200
Follow.
Us V.I.P.s shouldn't waste out evening

14:51.235 --> 14:52.600
among the commoners.

14:52.610 --> 14:54.330
They might think you're one of them.

14:55.810 --> 14:57.760
Yes, us V.I.P.s
wouldn't wanna be mistaken

14:57.795 --> 14:59.412
for one of the commoners.

14:59.447 --> 15:01.030
You couldn't be if you tried.

15:03.560 --> 15:04.560
Name.

15:04.730 --> 15:06.720
Carrie Bradshaw and Sebastian Kydd.

15:07.020 --> 15:08.530
I've got Bradshaw.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.380
No Kydd.

15:11.590 --> 15:14.240
There must be a mistake.
Um, do you have the spelling right?

15:14.275 --> 15:16.960
- K-y-d-d?
- Nope.

15:17.490 --> 15:19.205
Um, what about a plus one?

15:19.240 --> 15:20.140
Do you have me down for a plus one?

15:20.175 --> 15:22.610
I'm sorry. I checked.

15:23.150 --> 15:25.620
You're on the list. He isn't.

15:30.380 --> 15:31.845
I'm afraid we have a problem.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.750
And while i geared up for a fight...

15:34.350 --> 15:36.420
Mouse was doing more or less the same.

15:36.430 --> 15:38.050
What exactly
are you doing here anyway?

15:38.085 --> 15:40.260
It's like 7:00 at night.

15:40.430 --> 15:41.880
Don't you have somewhere to be?

15:42.140 --> 15:43.420
Just trying to help.

15:43.900 --> 15:45.480
And i like hanging out with you.

15:45.760 --> 15:48.070
Are you deliberately trying
to ruin my grades?

15:48.105 --> 15:49.320
Is that what you think?

15:49.870 --> 15:52.295
That i pretend to like you
just to mess up your G.P.A.?

15:52.330 --> 15:54.720
Please, i'd do the same thing
if i thought of it first,

15:54.755 --> 15:57.410
or if i could flirt, which i can't.

15:58.170 --> 15:59.620
Which is why i like you.

16:01.130 --> 16:03.080
I definitely do not like you back.

16:05.630 --> 16:06.890
Whatever you say.

16:07.610 --> 16:09.020
Stop it.

16:09.100 --> 16:09.820
Stop what?

16:09.830 --> 16:10.890
That.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.920
That cute smiling of yours.

16:12.955 --> 16:14.585
Did you just say "cute"?

16:14.620 --> 16:17.550
I meant annoying
and not at all appreciated

16:17.585 --> 16:19.690
or charming, and least of all, sexy.

16:22.670 --> 16:24.465
It's not going to work.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.260
I'm in complete control.

16:26.295 --> 16:27.470
Whatever you say.

16:27.830 --> 16:29.320
Until she wasn't.

16:38.420 --> 16:41.130
And while Mouse's evening took
a surprising turn...

16:41.330 --> 16:42.940
My dad was still trying to figure out

16:42.950 --> 16:45.780
what his evening was going to be, exactly.

16:45.815 --> 16:48.610
So when a woman asks you
over for a nightcap,

16:48.645 --> 16:49.565
what does at mean these days?

16:49.600 --> 16:51.075
It means you're getting laid, Tommy.

16:51.110 --> 16:53.205
Oh, come on.
This is a single mom from the suburbs.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.200
I'm only asking if i should
bring a bottle of something.

16:55.235 --> 16:57.720
She said to... come prepared.

16:57.755 --> 16:58.855
With condoms.

16:58.890 --> 17:00.015
Neither of you are teenagers,

17:00.050 --> 17:01.990
So stop wasting her time and yours.

17:02.025 --> 17:03.970
Get in there. Have some sex.

17:04.130 --> 17:06.550
- Come on, Tommy. Listen to me.
- Maybe you're right.

17:07.369 --> 17:07.974
Wait.
What?

17:08.010 --> 17:09.900
Maybe i'm just being uptight
because i haven't been dating

17:09.910 --> 17:11.880
- for a while.
- Or getting laid, my friend.

17:11.890 --> 17:13.859
- And it's time.
- It is.

17:13.869 --> 17:16.125
I'm gonna go in there
with a full head of steam,

17:16.160 --> 17:18.380
put on some Barry White,
make some moves, you know?

17:18.415 --> 17:19.700
Maybe i'll be a little rusty, but-

17:19.734 --> 17:21.520
You just said "Making moves. "

17:21.530 --> 17:23.095
I'd say you're a bit more than rusty.

17:23.130 --> 17:25.859
And go with Marvin Gaye.
You're rusty, not dead.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.550
All right.
Thanks for the advice.

17:27.585 --> 17:29.100
And one more word to the wise.

17:30.210 --> 17:31.100
Have a lot of fun.

17:31.110 --> 17:32.330
Oh, i will.

17:35.910 --> 17:36.920
Fun.

17:39.710 --> 17:42.540
Look, i don't know how many
other ways i can say this.

17:42.575 --> 17:43.785
You're holding up the line.

17:43.820 --> 17:46.010
So either come in or go away.
You got me?

17:46.045 --> 17:48.200
Well, is there someone else
we can speak to?

17:48.235 --> 17:49.095
Because this is supposed

17:49.130 --> 17:51.185
to be an important evening, and-

17:51.220 --> 17:55.000
Carrie. We can hang out here.
It's no big deal, really.

17:55.035 --> 17:56.182
Are you saying "It's no big deal"

17:56.217 --> 17:57.295
because it's actually no big deal,

17:57.330 --> 17:59.330
or are you gonna be annoyed
about it later?

17:59.430 --> 18:00.295
It's no big deal.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.340
It's just, i hate giving up like that.

18:02.375 --> 18:04.350
This was supposed to be
a special night.

18:04.460 --> 18:05.695
It is a special night.

18:05.730 --> 18:08.000
And getting into that area
doesn't change that.

18:17.980 --> 18:19.630
I promised you a perfect evening,

18:19.665 --> 18:20.885
and you're going to get one.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.270
And that includes breathing
the very air Madonna breathes

18:23.305 --> 18:24.895
- inside the V.I.P. area.
- Carrie...

18:24.930 --> 18:26.820
Don't ask me to give up
because i'm not going to.

18:26.830 --> 18:28.260
I'm gonna go in there, find Larissa,

18:28.270 --> 18:29.495
And get us some help, okay?

18:29.530 --> 18:31.350
You really don't have to do this.

18:31.390 --> 18:32.600
Have you met me?

18:33.430 --> 18:34.560
You're sexy when you're determined.

18:34.595 --> 18:35.790
I'll give you that.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.395
I couldn't explain,

18:58.430 --> 19:01.030
but as Sebastian disappeared
into the crowd.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.290
I had this awful feeling
that our perfect night

19:04.325 --> 19:05.790
was disappearing, too.

19:21.610 --> 19:23.460
Hey there, Carrie. Oh.

19:23.600 --> 19:24.840
What happened to your boy toy?

19:24.850 --> 19:26.420
He's stuck on the other side
of the velvet rope.

19:26.455 --> 19:27.990
I think Larissa forgot
to put him on the list.

19:28.025 --> 19:28.885
Do you know where she is?

19:28.920 --> 19:30.340
Last i saw,
she was headed to the kitchen

19:30.375 --> 19:31.360
'cause she heard they had coke,

19:31.370 --> 19:33.105
but i'm pretty sure
they meant the drink,

19:33.140 --> 19:34.650
so she'll probably be back soon,
and cranky.

19:34.685 --> 19:36.522
Okay, well,
you're the nightclub expert.

19:36.557 --> 19:38.633
How do i get Sebastian
into the V.I.P. area?

19:38.668 --> 19:40.710
Well, let's see.
I'd say seduce a bouncer

19:40.745 --> 19:41.870
like Floyd over there,

19:41.880 --> 19:43.220
but you're not really Floyd's type-

19:43.255 --> 19:44.045
You know, male.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.750
Also, i'm kinda taken.

19:45.830 --> 19:47.175
You're so cute with your morals.

19:47.210 --> 19:48.560
All right, you know what i always do?

19:48.595 --> 19:50.165
I find some guy with big wrists.

19:50.200 --> 19:53.080
Tell him he's cute,
and then ask him to borrow his wristband.

19:53.115 --> 19:55.040
Voila. V.I.P. ready.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.055
Not that i was looking,

19:56.090 --> 19:58.610
but Sebastian has pretty big hands, right?

19:58.970 --> 20:00.710
- Yeah.
- Lucky you.

20:00.820 --> 20:02.880
Well, this will never fit him.
I put it on too tight.

20:03.190 --> 20:05.120
Um, we need to find someone like...

20:05.740 --> 20:08.100
like... oh, that guy.

20:11.080 --> 20:14.470
Yep. He's got big wrists-
big, terrifying wrists,

20:14.505 --> 20:16.515
ones that could snap me like a twig.

20:16.550 --> 20:18.370
Yeah, i think he uses them
to strangle bears.

20:20.590 --> 20:21.410
Carrie...

20:23.220 --> 20:24.250
May Madonna be with you.

20:24.285 --> 20:25.010
Amen.

20:32.060 --> 20:33.730
Hi. Excuse me.

20:34.650 --> 20:37.425
Uh... i was wondering
if you might be willing

20:37.460 --> 20:39.490
to part with your bracelet
for a couple of minutes?

20:40.240 --> 20:42.060
See, my boyfriend is stuck
on the other side

20:42.070 --> 20:42.930
of the V.I.P.line.

20:42.940 --> 20:43.845
He was supposed to be on the list,

20:43.880 --> 20:46.015
but for some reason, he isn't,
which totally sucks,

20:46.050 --> 20:48.490
because tonight was supposed to be
a special evening for us.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.880
I mean, really special.
Like, you know what i mean.

20:50.890 --> 20:52.960
And i'm starting to think
he's getting annoyed with me

20:53.000 --> 20:54.450
because i dragged him here
and because

20:54.485 --> 20:55.900
he told me he loved me
this past week,

20:56.390 --> 20:58.460
and i've been trying to find
the perfect time and place

20:58.550 --> 21:00.130
to say it back,
which i thought it was tonight,

21:00.165 --> 21:01.210
- only now-
- stop.

21:02.410 --> 21:04.500
Yes, i'm sorry.
I will shut up. I'm sorry.

21:04.900 --> 21:07.050
Me and my boyfriend kissed
for the first time

21:07.080 --> 21:08.650
to Madonna's "Burning up. "

21:09.920 --> 21:11.930
And i'm a sucker for a love story.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.390
My boyfriend runs the V.I.P. area.

21:15.425 --> 21:16.480
Let me talk to him.

21:17.910 --> 21:18.820
Thank you.

21:19.580 --> 21:22.030
And while i was relived
to have regained control...

21:23.470 --> 21:25.850
Mouse felt like
she had completely lost it.

21:29.670 --> 21:31.190
Okay. Enough of this.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.890
Huh. Where are you going?

21:34.360 --> 21:35.330
I have somewhere to be.

21:35.490 --> 21:37.390
So you don't wanna talk
or hang out more?

21:37.900 --> 21:38.950
We could just lie here.

21:39.430 --> 21:40.900
Of course that's
what you'd like me to do.

21:41.160 --> 21:42.870
Just lie here and be distracted.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.010
It's not going to happen, buster.

21:45.700 --> 21:46.920
I have things to do.

21:55.260 --> 21:57.720
It figures you'd be reading a book
about cancer.

21:57.970 --> 22:00.500
Ms. Doom and gloom
and her sister tiny dancer.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.310
Not that i care what you think,

22:02.320 --> 22:03.640
but it's a book about sex.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.920
Well... color me interested.

22:06.340 --> 22:08.450
A book about sex and an outfit

22:08.460 --> 22:10.130
that doesn't scream "Hate me. "

22:10.760 --> 22:12.260
Does little Bradshaw have a man?

22:13.900 --> 22:16.380
You do.
Good for you.

22:17.510 --> 22:18.450
What's your name again?

22:18.720 --> 22:19.405
Dorrit.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.690
Funny name.
You can carry it though.

22:21.940 --> 22:24.720
- Thanks.
- So you're all dolled up for your new man.

22:24.780 --> 22:25.770
Are you seeing him tonight?

22:26.020 --> 22:27.750
I'm not dressing like this for him.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.810
Why not? I always change
for the guys i'm with.

22:29.940 --> 22:31.720
I once went Goth for three weeks

22:31.810 --> 22:34.420
for this one guy,
but it was a horrible look for me.

22:34.455 --> 22:35.265
Take my advice.

22:35.300 --> 22:37.640
Boobs and an army jacket do not work.

22:39.140 --> 22:40.990
So what guy are
you wearing that bag for?

22:41.120 --> 22:43.980
The Coach bag is for me
because it is gorgeous.

22:45.920 --> 22:48.940
Doesn't changing for a guy
kinda make you a little pathetic?

22:49.550 --> 22:52.270
Like you're giving away
your power or something?

22:52.305 --> 22:54.990
You're not giving up control.
You're taking control.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.420
Relationships are transactions.

22:56.430 --> 22:57.990
I give you cleavage
and legs up to here.

22:58.025 --> 22:58.860
You buy me dinner.

22:59.240 --> 23:02.280
I give you sex.
I take... well, everything.

23:02.950 --> 23:03.820
Circle of life.

23:04.350 --> 23:07.470
But isn't giving it up,
well, giving it up?

23:07.560 --> 23:09.180
In my experience, it's the opposite.

23:09.910 --> 23:12.890
Once they have sex with you,
they're hooked.

23:13.250 --> 23:15.140
Yeah, i think that's probably
just for you.

23:15.670 --> 23:18.595
Maybe. Sex is fun.
It isn't love.

23:18.630 --> 23:20.520
Just remember that, and you will be fine.

23:21.860 --> 23:25.310
And be safe.
We don't need any more curly haired crazies

23:25.345 --> 23:26.500
running around this town.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.230
Agreed.

23:29.410 --> 23:30.280
Smart girl.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.240
Got you a little present.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.620
Did you have to do anything illegal
to get me that?

23:46.790 --> 23:48.140
Do you really wanna know?

23:48.175 --> 23:49.490
Not if i'll have to testify.

23:50.260 --> 23:52.770
Look, i'm really sorry
about leaving you alone.

23:53.240 --> 23:55.090
I mean, i'm the one
who dragged you to this party.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.170
All my friends are here.
You don't know anyone.

23:57.205 --> 23:57.565
Are you kidding?

23:57.600 --> 23:59.330
I had my scottish friend here
to keep my company.

23:59.470 --> 24:02.000
I know. I just hate being taken
to parties

24:02.035 --> 24:02.730
where i don't know anyone,

24:02.750 --> 24:04.130
and i didn't want you
to feel that way.

24:04.165 --> 24:04.960
You know?

24:06.030 --> 24:07.365
Carrie, i wouldn't feel that way

24:07.400 --> 24:08.700
if you didn't keep bringing it up.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.010
Seriously, it's fine.
I'm not afraid to be on my own.

24:11.320 --> 24:12.270
So can we drop it?

24:12.360 --> 24:14.460
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

24:14.710 --> 24:16.630
Now what do you say we stop
with all the apologies

24:16.640 --> 24:18.030
and worrying and go have fun?

24:18.460 --> 24:19.670
Yeah. Sounds good.

24:21.730 --> 24:23.510
Still sorry, though.

24:23.740 --> 24:24.610
Stop it.

24:25.390 --> 24:27.820
And while i led Sebastian
into the VIP area,

24:28.740 --> 24:31.710
my dad was being led
somewhere exclusive as well.

24:32.540 --> 24:35.140
And... this is my bedroom.

24:35.940 --> 24:38.790
I used to have
a waterbed until my son decided

24:38.800 --> 24:41.030
to jump on it wearing his cleats.

24:41.700 --> 24:42.770
Waterbed, huh?

24:42.990 --> 24:44.780
I always wanted to sleep
on one of those.

24:44.990 --> 24:46.630
Well, how do you feel about
a posturepedic,

24:46.640 --> 24:48.030
which is what i have now?

24:49.780 --> 24:52.170
Posturepedic, huh?
That sounds...

24:52.650 --> 24:53.440
So...

24:54.470 --> 24:55.620
You know what?
There's really no way to make that

24:55.655 --> 24:57.450
- sound sexy, is there?
- Not really.

24:57.460 --> 24:58.710
Let's go back to talking
about that waterbed.

24:58.780 --> 24:59.740
That was more fun.

25:01.040 --> 25:03.180
Uh... wh-what are you doing?

25:04.190 --> 25:07.260
I am totally reading
this situation all wrong, aren't i?

25:07.330 --> 25:10.580
Oh! I'm such an idiot.
I never should've listened to Harlan-

25:10.850 --> 25:11.630
Tom.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.550
I'm kidding.

25:15.450 --> 25:17.860
- Still an easy target, huh?
- Yes.

25:17.980 --> 25:18.700
Yeah.

25:19.430 --> 25:21.350
Why are we still talking?

25:30.140 --> 25:32.160
I could use another drink.
You want anything, Bradshaw?

25:32.195 --> 25:33.090
Oh, you don't have to do that.

25:33.125 --> 25:34.140
I can get the drink.

25:34.220 --> 25:35.670
I can handle it.
What do you want?

25:35.740 --> 25:37.385
Surprise me.
And when you get back,

25:37.420 --> 25:38.720
I promise we'll
spend some time together,

25:38.755 --> 25:39.690
just the two of us.

25:40.120 --> 25:41.740
Now that sounds amazing.

25:46.100 --> 25:46.825
Bennet, hey.

25:46.860 --> 25:48.370
I can't talk right now, Carrie, okay?

25:48.590 --> 25:49.645
I just found out Madonna's
about to leave,

25:49.680 --> 25:51.020
which means this place
is going to clear out in,

25:51.055 --> 25:52.510
like, four minutes, six tops.

25:52.650 --> 25:54.130
And there's no after party.

25:54.165 --> 25:55.610
There's always an after party.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.150
The party will still be fun.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.730
No, the party will be over.
O- v-e-r.

25:59.790 --> 26:01.230
And i haven't even gotten
all my quotes yet.

26:01.265 --> 26:02.800
I- i thought there'd be more time,

26:02.870 --> 26:03.830
but there are just too many people

26:03.840 --> 26:05.210
for me to talk to myself.

26:07.900 --> 26:08.820
Maybe you could help me.

26:08.880 --> 26:11.135
Oh, i totally want to. Totally.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.360
But... i don't want to
abandon Sebastian again.

26:13.395 --> 26:15.550
I'm worried he might
be a little pissed at me.

26:15.620 --> 26:17.550
Just to clarify, any quotes you can get

26:17.585 --> 26:18.865
would go in the magazine,

26:18.900 --> 26:21.430
"reported by Carrie Bradshaw"

26:22.030 --> 26:23.090
My own byline?

26:24.330 --> 26:25.980
Suddenly, i saw an opportunity-

26:26.550 --> 26:28.130
one i couldn't afford to pass up.

26:28.660 --> 26:30.250
So i decided to take control.

26:30.430 --> 26:31.300
I'm your girl.

26:31.460 --> 26:32.425
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

26:32.460 --> 26:35.290
- Great. Okay. You see that guy over there in the booth?
- Mm-hmm.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.395
That's Billy Steinberg.

26:36.430 --> 26:38.690
He wrote the lyrics to Madonna's
"Like a virgin"

26:38.960 --> 26:39.930
If you could
just get a quote from him-

26:39.965 --> 26:41.382
I mean, something, anything-

26:41.417 --> 26:42.800
I would totally owe you.

26:43.290 --> 26:44.260
Okay. On it.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.600
Thanks, darling. You are a lifesaver.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.720
All right, i'm off to talk
to the costumer about crinoline.

26:48.970 --> 26:50.510
I didn't have time to feel guilty.

26:50.720 --> 26:51.990
I had a quote to chase.

26:52.290 --> 26:53.890
Sebastian and my own byline?

26:54.190 --> 26:56.230
It would truly be a perfect evening.

26:57.430 --> 26:59.370
Where are you off to in such a hurry?
Hot date?

26:59.490 --> 27:00.325
Sebastian, i'm sorry.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.270
I- i just have to go
take care of a work thing.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.900
Oh, you really were
heading off somewhere,

27:04.020 --> 27:04.970
and here i was joking.

27:05.060 --> 27:06.665
Well, i'm sorry.
Bennet was in a bind,

27:06.700 --> 27:08.270
so he asked me to do
a favor for him,

27:08.320 --> 27:09.840
and it might really help
my writing career.

27:10.340 --> 27:11.260
You have a career now?

27:11.270 --> 27:12.950
Well, a future one,
if i get this quote.

27:13.950 --> 27:15.390
Do what you have to do, Bradshaw.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.530
- You sure?
- I'm not afraid to be on my own.

27:18.620 --> 27:19.645
I already told you that.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.990
Okay. I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

27:22.680 --> 27:24.220
I know. You told me a hundred times.

27:42.340 --> 27:44.260
Really?
So no one like the title?

27:44.460 --> 27:45.140
No one.

27:45.150 --> 27:47.100
I even had to convince Tom,
my writing partner,

27:47.135 --> 27:49.240
that it's a lyric
we should stick with.

27:49.700 --> 27:51.230
So why did you stick with it?

27:51.600 --> 27:53.010
Because that's how i felt.

27:54.140 --> 27:57.230
New love makes you feel
like you're being touched

27:57.265 --> 27:58.390
for the first time,

27:59.970 --> 28:01.150
like you're a virgin,

28:01.760 --> 28:02.840
like it's perfect.

28:05.070 --> 28:06.280
Have you ever felt that before?

28:07.450 --> 28:10.260
I feel that now... with my boyfriend.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.350
He's here waiting for me.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.010
But what are you doing here with me?

28:14.370 --> 28:16.700
Oh. Leaving.
Is that okay?

28:17.300 --> 28:19.280
I wrote the song.
I believe in it.

28:20.030 --> 28:22.010
Go get touched
like it's the first time.

28:22.330 --> 28:23.940
Little did he know, it would be.

28:24.680 --> 28:25.420
Thank you.

28:55.460 --> 28:57.330
Hey. Hey, buddy.

28:57.550 --> 28:58.690
You looking for the bathroom?

28:59.140 --> 29:00.670
Uh... yeah.

29:01.950 --> 29:02.930
It's in there.

29:04.200 --> 29:04.980
Thanks.

29:07.780 --> 29:08.485
I'm Tom.

29:08.520 --> 29:09.190
Dylan.

29:09.700 --> 29:11.090
'kay. Night.

29:21.740 --> 29:22.635
What's going on?

29:22.670 --> 29:25.410
Oh, not much.
I, uh, i just ran into your kid

29:25.445 --> 29:26.580
out in the hallway.

29:26.990 --> 29:28.620
- And i was naked.
- Oh, god.

29:28.630 --> 29:29.495
Is he okay?

29:29.530 --> 29:31.605
I don't know.
He just- he walked back to his room

29:31.640 --> 29:33.680
like this kind of
thing happens to him all the time.

29:35.030 --> 29:36.960
Does this kind of
thing happen to him all the time?

29:36.995 --> 29:41.280
No. He must have been sleepwalking,
i hope.

29:41.300 --> 29:42.920
God, he never wakes up.

29:43.090 --> 29:44.840
I honestly just can't believe

29:44.850 --> 29:46.430
you would let a man spend the night here

29:46.465 --> 29:48.010
while your son was under the same roof.

29:48.045 --> 29:48.980
I thought you told me that your ex

29:49.015 --> 29:49.980
was taking him for the night.

29:50.015 --> 29:50.695
He was,

29:50.730 --> 29:52.570
until he flaked on me.

29:53.140 --> 29:54.980
Look, i thought about canceling,

29:55.015 --> 29:56.727
but i really like you,

29:56.762 --> 29:58.405
and with our schedules,

29:58.440 --> 30:00.520
I wasn't sure when i'd get
my chance to see you again.

30:00.770 --> 30:02.790
Look, you of all people should understand

30:02.870 --> 30:04.810
how challenging it is to be a single parent.

30:04.930 --> 30:06.135
It is not that challenging.

30:06.170 --> 30:08.990
How about just...
don't have sex in the house

30:09.025 --> 30:10.310
while your kid is in it?

30:11.180 --> 30:14.280
Okay. That's it.

30:14.750 --> 30:15.770
You need to leave.

30:16.490 --> 30:19.090
I am doing the best that i can here, buddy.

30:19.180 --> 30:21.430
And i don't need to be judged
by the likes of you.

30:22.690 --> 30:24.070
I didn't mean to judge.

30:25.280 --> 30:28.550
Look, i-i can stay longer
if you wanna talk about it more.

30:28.650 --> 30:32.440
Oh, let me think about that.
Um, i'm a single mother

30:32.475 --> 30:34.170
who doesn't get enough sleep, so no.

30:34.540 --> 30:37.180
I don't need you to stay
so we can talk about it.

30:39.400 --> 30:40.680
You can let yourself out.

30:50.140 --> 30:52.400
You're here kinda late.
Is everything cool?

30:53.450 --> 30:54.770
I finished the book.

30:54.980 --> 30:56.320
You read faster than i do.

30:56.880 --> 30:58.510
I don't know anyone
who reads faster than me.

30:58.650 --> 31:00.080
I'm fast at a lot of things.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.740
You mad at me or something?

31:01.900 --> 31:02.715
Did you give me that book

31:02.750 --> 31:04.120
so i'd want to have sex with you?

31:04.230 --> 31:05.170
No.

31:06.260 --> 31:07.030
Maybe.

31:07.690 --> 31:08.930
Does that make me a horndog?

31:09.040 --> 31:10.000
Makes you smart.

31:10.770 --> 31:12.020
I've been thinking about it a lot.

31:12.060 --> 31:14.080
- You have?
- Yeah.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.020
You know what?
I have, too.

31:18.080 --> 31:21.250
And you've been through so much this year

31:21.285 --> 31:22.365
with your mom and everything,

31:22.400 --> 31:25.190
and i know you don't show it,
but you feel everything.

31:25.540 --> 31:27.620
You're vulnerable,
and i don't wanna hurt you

31:27.655 --> 31:31.100
by taking advantage of that.

31:31.310 --> 31:33.920
You wouldn't be.
I want to.

31:34.630 --> 31:35.970
You don't know what you want.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.335
A month ago, i sat in my room all day

31:38.370 --> 31:40.630
just waiting to see
if anybody would wonder where i was

31:40.665 --> 31:41.710
or what i was doing.

31:42.490 --> 31:43.400
No one ever came...

31:43.710 --> 31:46.600
or cared... for nine hours.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.320
My family never even checked on me.

31:50.400 --> 31:51.560
I would have.

31:53.640 --> 31:54.680
I know.

32:02.870 --> 32:04.320
I've been looking everywhere for you.

32:05.130 --> 32:06.450
What are you doing here?

32:06.890 --> 32:08.880
This is the meeting
of the astronomy club.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.600
I am the president, and i'm very busy.

32:11.780 --> 32:12.710
Doing what?

32:12.930 --> 32:15.750
Presiding over this club... of one-me.

32:16.990 --> 32:19.610
Well, i've always want to know more
about the stars.

32:20.190 --> 32:22.630
So why don't you tell me something
about astronomy?

32:23.420 --> 32:25.300
The Crab Nebula is visible tonight.

32:25.430 --> 32:27.190
I've never seen the Crab Nebula.

32:33.690 --> 32:34.700
This is nice.

32:39.550 --> 32:41.400
I don't really care about astronomy.

32:46.190 --> 32:48.090
I don't get it. You don't like me?

32:48.350 --> 32:49.450
No, worse.

32:49.770 --> 32:51.490
- You're repulsed by me?
- Worse.

32:53.410 --> 32:55.520
I can't control myself
when i'm with you.

32:56.020 --> 32:57.190
I've been down this road before,

32:57.225 --> 32:58.360
and i ain't going there again.

32:58.760 --> 32:59.910
Is this because of your ex?

32:59.970 --> 33:00.910
Seth.

33:02.290 --> 33:04.490
He was the first boy
i ever had sex with.

33:06.340 --> 33:07.490
Ever loved.

33:08.160 --> 33:08.825
What happened?

33:08.860 --> 33:10.725
I blew my G.P.A. up

33:10.760 --> 33:12.070
and lost Number One in the class to you.

33:16.050 --> 33:17.200
Meeting adjourned.

33:23.470 --> 33:26.010
That was amazing.
It was the perfect quote,

33:26.160 --> 33:28.670
which means i might get
my first byline in the magazine.

33:29.100 --> 33:30.650
My name in "Interview"

33:30.880 --> 33:32.690
seriously, if you would have
told me this a year ago,

33:32.720 --> 33:34.090
I never would have believed you.

33:35.090 --> 33:37.260
This might end up being
the best night of my life.

33:38.190 --> 33:39.930
That's why this is
the best night of your life?

33:40.170 --> 33:41.210
Because of the magazine?

33:41.640 --> 33:43.500
This was supposed to be
a night about us.

33:43.535 --> 33:44.740
It is about us.

33:44.790 --> 33:47.320
No. You pretty much just made it
a night about you.

33:47.580 --> 33:50.290
Are you serious?
I mean, sure, i helped out a friend

33:50.325 --> 33:52.320
with some work
and then caught a lucky break,

33:52.330 --> 33:54.290
but if anything, i feel like
i spent the entire night

33:54.340 --> 33:55.640
worrying about you.

33:55.950 --> 33:57.930
I'm fine, Carrie. I've been fine.

33:57.940 --> 33:59.460
I never asked you to take care of me.

33:59.630 --> 34:03.190
You never ask.
I always have to dig things out of you.

34:03.260 --> 34:06.035
I mean, you basically denied

34:06.070 --> 34:07.060
you were annoyed with me the entire
night when you really were.

34:07.095 --> 34:09.179
Because you kept getting distracted
by everything else.

34:09.560 --> 34:12.290
I didn't care about the party
or the V.I.P. room.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.139
I just wanted to be with you.

34:15.010 --> 34:16.304
You kept saying you were fine.

34:16.340 --> 34:18.290
You're always doing that-
putting up walls,

34:18.510 --> 34:19.860
and then leaving me to figure out

34:19.895 --> 34:20.969
how to take care of you.

34:21.170 --> 34:22.060
I can't believe
you're the one saying

34:22.094 --> 34:23.370
i never tell you my feelings.

34:23.630 --> 34:24.940
It's not like you told me yours.

34:25.929 --> 34:26.635
Sebastian.

34:26.670 --> 34:29.590
Seriously? I told you i loved you
a week ago.

34:30.120 --> 34:32.020
I kept thinking you were waiting
to tell me you loved me

34:32.030 --> 34:33.540
because you're such a perfectionist.

34:34.310 --> 34:35.540
That-that's not true.

34:36.420 --> 34:37.880
Then why didn't you say it?

34:40.010 --> 34:41.239
Is it because you don't feel it?

34:42.190 --> 34:43.080
No.

34:44.110 --> 34:45.090
Then why?

34:46.659 --> 34:49.010
Because i wanted the moment to be perfect.

34:49.699 --> 34:51.050
That doesn't make me a monster.

34:51.085 --> 34:51.945
God, you just can't

34:51.980 --> 34:53.210
let anything be real, can you?

34:53.530 --> 34:54.880
Most people,
when they feel something,

34:54.915 --> 34:56.500
they say it.
That's what i did.

34:56.690 --> 34:57.585
Well, now i can't say it

34:57.620 --> 34:58.935
because you're just gonna think

34:58.970 --> 35:00.250
I'm saying it because i have to.

35:00.260 --> 35:02.110
Why do you have to think
so much about everything?

35:03.040 --> 35:04.580
Because that's who i am,

35:05.140 --> 35:06.990
and obviously
you don't like that

35:07.090 --> 35:08.015
or the choices i make

35:08.050 --> 35:09.110
or what's important to me,

35:09.190 --> 35:10.710
So if that's the way you feel,

35:10.900 --> 35:12.570
then maybe we should just break up.

35:13.440 --> 35:15.880
Once again,
i had lost control of my mouth.

35:16.620 --> 35:19.290
I could only hope
Sebastian was in control of his.

35:19.680 --> 35:21.770
Well, if that's what you want, fine.

35:23.010 --> 35:24.630
It's always about
what you want, anyway.

35:36.340 --> 35:39.890
I never even told him i love him, Mouse.

35:41.460 --> 35:44.320
And i do... so much.

35:44.380 --> 35:47.450
Maybe you could call him,
tell him you made a mistake.

35:48.100 --> 35:49.710
He let me break up with him.

35:50.230 --> 35:51.630
He didn't fight for me.

35:51.720 --> 35:53.410
Well, maybe he was afraid to.

35:53.550 --> 35:55.700
I think that's
why i said it in the moment-

35:56.560 --> 35:57.720
that we should break up.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.130
Like if it was going to happen,

36:00.770 --> 36:04.260
I wanted to control it
and make it hurt less.

36:05.380 --> 36:06.290
And?

36:06.870 --> 36:09.070
Like i'm in physical pain.

36:11.360 --> 36:12.310
I'm sorry.

36:12.590 --> 36:13.500
And i get it.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.610
It'll get better.

36:17.130 --> 36:18.050
When?

36:22.080 --> 36:23.320
Not soon enough.

36:34.100 --> 36:36.800
Listen, i'm-i'm sorry
i ran out on you last night.

36:36.835 --> 36:38.290
I kicked you out.

36:39.170 --> 36:41.580
Yeah, but you wouldn't have done that

36:41.890 --> 36:44.170
if i hadn't tried to run out on you
in the first place.

36:45.370 --> 36:46.950
I should have been more sympathetic.

36:47.960 --> 36:50.080
Of course i know
how hard it is to date

36:50.115 --> 36:50.875
when you have kids.

36:50.910 --> 36:52.680
I mean, obviously,
i'm new to the situation,

36:52.730 --> 36:53.830
but i get it.

36:54.140 --> 36:55.130
Anyway, i'm...

36:56.590 --> 36:58.075
pretty sure i've screwed all this up,

36:58.110 --> 36:59.980
and it's too late,
but for what it's worth,

37:01.320 --> 37:02.430
I apologize.

37:03.930 --> 37:06.380
And i totally understand
you not wanting to see me again,

37:06.610 --> 37:09.360
but i hope at least now, you know,

37:09.540 --> 37:12.250
when we bump into each other,
it wouldn't be hideously awkward.

37:15.550 --> 37:16.380
Tom.

37:16.470 --> 37:18.830
Look, just wait.

37:18.880 --> 37:19.600
Yeah?

37:19.760 --> 37:23.620
Look, uh, we're dating,
and that means we're gonna fight.

37:24.170 --> 37:24.860
We are?

37:24.890 --> 37:26.130
Yeah, of course we are.

37:26.650 --> 37:28.330
I don't know.
Dating?

37:29.100 --> 37:30.610
I mean, we made out in my car,

37:30.850 --> 37:32.400
had coffee a couple of times.

37:34.670 --> 37:36.600
I'm sorry. I'm a little rusty.

37:36.660 --> 37:37.840
What would you call that?

37:38.010 --> 37:39.400
Dating.
I'm messing with you.

37:40.370 --> 37:41.850
I'm an easy target, aren't i?

37:42.200 --> 37:44.320
No. Just right.

37:45.690 --> 37:48.430
Boy, dating sure looks a lot different

37:48.465 --> 37:49.810
than when we were young, huh?

37:50.500 --> 37:52.160
Some things are scarily similar.

37:52.570 --> 37:54.085
Instead of sneaking around,
trying not to bump

37:54.120 --> 37:56.740
into somebody's parents,
i'm hiding from their kid.

37:57.070 --> 38:00.290
And on that note, uh,
if we are gonna keep dating,

38:00.430 --> 38:03.270
I promise next time,
i will get a babysitter.

38:03.770 --> 38:04.620
Okay.

38:04.790 --> 38:05.660
Okay.

38:09.450 --> 38:10.490
What are you doing here?

38:11.090 --> 38:12.630
Are you kidding? It's saturday.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.070
That means two things-

38:14.370 --> 38:16.210
that my brother's watching "Smurfs" on TV,

38:16.245 --> 38:17.730
and i hit the gardening club.

38:18.130 --> 38:19.780
You can set your watch to it.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.510
What? I can't be into gardening, too?

38:21.890 --> 38:23.125
No one's into gardening,

38:23.160 --> 38:24.740
especially on a saturday morning.

38:25.150 --> 38:27.830
Okay, maybe i'm not into gardening,

38:28.020 --> 38:29.880
but i'm into the president
of the gardening club.

38:29.930 --> 38:30.800
West.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.990
Just the two students
i was hoping to run into.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.420
- Hi, Mr. Sperry. - Hey there.

38:35.760 --> 38:39.690
So... I gather you two were both here
awfully late last night.

38:40.480 --> 38:41.460
We... were.

38:41.860 --> 38:42.545
And i gather you spend

38:42.580 --> 38:44.810
a lot of productive private time together?

38:45.360 --> 38:47.190
Uh...
Mr. Sperry, we can explain.

38:47.410 --> 38:49.200
Explain? You don't have to
explain anything.

38:49.235 --> 38:50.090
I read the minutes.

38:50.125 --> 38:51.200
Minutes?

38:51.980 --> 38:54.720
As secretary of the U.S.A. for Africa
and Astronomy clubs,

38:54.755 --> 38:56.580
it's my job to make sure
the faculty advisor

38:56.615 --> 38:58.070
gets all the minutes
from the meeting.

38:58.480 --> 38:59.610
But you already knew that.

39:00.840 --> 39:03.430
First, you both stay here late dealing
with the chocolate bars

39:03.465 --> 39:05.415
for U.S.A. for africa,
then you two

39:05.450 --> 39:07.520
single-handedly resuscitate
the astronomy club,

39:07.530 --> 39:10.160
and by the looks of it,
the gardening club is next?

39:11.360 --> 39:12.735
I am gonna write you both

39:12.770 --> 39:14.570
one hell of a recommendation for college.

39:17.320 --> 39:18.660
What was it you were telling me

39:18.730 --> 39:20.125
about how dating me would get in the way

39:20.160 --> 39:21.940
of your grades
and your college applications?

39:22.380 --> 39:23.960
West, i don't know.

39:25.150 --> 39:26.390
Do you like me?

39:27.670 --> 39:28.550
If you say no,

39:28.560 --> 39:30.080
i will leave you alone, i promise.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.930
No. I don't like you.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.310
I don't believe you.

39:34.520 --> 39:37.120
No fair.
You said you'd leave me alone.

39:38.030 --> 39:38.860
Fine.

39:40.580 --> 39:42.230
I do like you. So what?

39:42.430 --> 39:44.100
So... i like you, too.

39:44.480 --> 39:45.760
Does anything else really matter?

39:45.870 --> 39:47.830
Yes. Lots of stuff matters.

39:47.865 --> 39:49.790
What are you, an idiot?

39:50.720 --> 39:52.850
Come on. One date.

39:53.400 --> 39:54.570
You know i'm not gonna leave you alone

39:54.605 --> 39:55.730
until you say yes.

39:56.090 --> 39:56.935
I'm gonna bug you so much

39:56.970 --> 39:58.890
that i will seriously
mess up your grades.

39:59.850 --> 40:01.770
You're gonna have to go
to Cornell or something.

40:03.100 --> 40:04.290
Fine.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.370
One date.

40:07.390 --> 40:08.560
I knew it.

40:08.930 --> 40:10.030
You're into me.

40:13.750 --> 40:14.960
We should probably keep it down.

40:15.020 --> 40:16.850
I don't want my dad to know
i snuck you up here.

40:23.560 --> 40:25.040
Not a Judy Blume in sight.

40:25.240 --> 40:26.560
Those are over there,

40:26.760 --> 40:28.340
Next to all my "Little house" Books.

40:28.490 --> 40:29.095
One look at this shelf,

40:29.130 --> 40:30.420
you'd never guess i was a rebel.

40:30.650 --> 40:31.875
I'm just too lazy to bother,

40:31.910 --> 40:33.860
and i secretly love
my cabbage patch kids.

40:35.430 --> 40:36.680
I love all your secrets.

40:36.890 --> 40:38.610
You don't think
they're scary and weird?

40:39.210 --> 40:40.520
I think they're a part of you.

40:41.080 --> 40:42.130
So no.

40:44.020 --> 40:46.210
Even how i smell my hair
when i'm nervous or thinking?

40:46.360 --> 40:47.800
Well, i think that's just cute.

40:48.070 --> 40:49.000
Really?

40:49.690 --> 40:50.770
Really.

40:52.010 --> 40:53.290
I'm glad we're gonna do it.

40:54.340 --> 40:55.640
That's really weird hearing
you say that

40:55.675 --> 40:57.380
when your dolls are staring at me.

40:57.990 --> 40:59.930
Don't worry about them.
They're total pervs.

41:00.080 --> 41:01.660
They like hearing about doing it.

41:47.200 --> 41:50.900
