WEBVTT

00:20.834 --> 00:23.083
(female #1)
'Steven totally surprised
me.'

00:23.166 --> 00:24.291
I've seen that street!

00:24.375 --> 00:26.083
Those houses are glamour
to the max, okay?

00:26.166 --> 00:28.417
Steven told me I could
decorate however I wanted.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.250
I mean, he's at the
hospital
all the time, anyway.

00:30.333 --> 00:31.959
No way! Any way you wanted?

00:32.041 --> 00:34.291
So far, I've got
leopard skin
chairs

00:34.375 --> 00:38.083
'a Persian carpet and Faberge
eggs for the mantle.'

00:38.166 --> 00:41.041
If I was you,
I'd get, like, a big neon
sign

00:41.125 --> 00:44.208
like with my name on it
and put it in the living
room.

00:44.291 --> 00:47.667
I'm thinking
more,
classical.

00:47.750 --> 00:49.458
Oh, sure.

00:50.875 --> 00:52.583
No way!

00:53.875 --> 00:55.834
Your doctor's here,
Mrs. Chase.

01:00.583 --> 01:02.250
Steven?

01:02.333 --> 01:03.583
Lindsay?

01:06.166 --> 01:08.959
Honey, is there something
wrong?
Babe, you're sweating!

01:09.041 --> 01:11.291
Alan..

01:11.375 --> 01:12.625
...died.

01:13.917 --> 01:15.125
What do you mean?

01:15.208 --> 01:16.500
You were gonna operate
on him today--

01:16.583 --> 01:18.834
On the table.
During surgery.

01:18.917 --> 01:22.625
- While I was operating.
- No, no, honey.

01:22.709 --> 01:24.542
(Steven)
'I think..'

01:24.625 --> 01:26.250
...it's gonna
get ugly, Lindsay.

01:36.417 --> 01:38.000
Don't worry
about the
bill.

02:56.125 --> 02:57.583
The place
looks ransacked.

02:57.667 --> 03:00.041
Junkie housekeeping.

03:00.125 --> 03:01.083
What do we got?

03:01.166 --> 03:03.083
Melanie castle, 44.

03:03.166 --> 03:05.250
Looks like
a heroin overdose.

03:05.333 --> 03:06.709
No foul play.

03:06.792 --> 03:08.250
(Jeffries)
'Well, I'm guessing
we're not here'

03:08.333 --> 03:10.250
because an apartment
just came on the market.

03:10.333 --> 03:13.041
You two remember
the Lindsay Chase murder?

03:13.125 --> 03:15.458
A doctor kills his wife
for the insurance money.

03:15.542 --> 03:16.834
(Stillman)
'23 years, Steven Chase'

03:16.917 --> 03:18.458
has been in prison,
tellin' the same story

03:18.542 --> 03:19.625
about that night.

03:19.709 --> 03:21.542
So what's
the connection here?

03:21.625 --> 03:22.750
Well, the doctor swore

03:22.834 --> 03:24.875
he heard a gunshot,
came downstairs

03:24.959 --> 03:26.792
and saw a shaggy man
and a blonde woman

03:26.875 --> 03:27.917
'running out the door.'

03:28.000 --> 03:29.500
(Jeffries)
'Only no one ever'

03:29.583 --> 03:31.125
found evidence they existed.

03:31.208 --> 03:32.792
Right.

03:32.875 --> 03:35.709
Melanie here was wearing this.

03:35.792 --> 03:38.375
There's an inscription.

03:38.458 --> 03:40.667
Mm. "Dr. Chase..

03:40.750 --> 03:43.625
all my love, Lindsay."

03:43.709 --> 03:46.083
- Steven Chase's ring?
- Yep.

03:46.166 --> 03:48.750
Which ended up..

03:48.834 --> 03:50.500
'...on a blonde woman.'

04:27.542 --> 04:30.000
This whole box
is wacko phone calls

04:30.083 --> 04:31.375
useful citizens
offering they know

04:31.458 --> 04:34.125
a blonde gal and a shaggy guy.

04:34.208 --> 04:36.250
Gotta love
the specifics there.

04:36.333 --> 04:37.750
Jury didn't buy
the doctor's
story.

04:37.834 --> 04:39.458
Convicted him
in two hours.

04:39.542 --> 04:41.959
So Steven Chase is
a big-league
surgeon

04:42.041 --> 04:43.458
until he
loses a
patient.

04:43.542 --> 04:45.959
Well, not just any patient,
a friend, Alan Moore.

04:46.041 --> 04:48.667
And Moore's widow sues
for malpractice

04:48.750 --> 04:50.667
the doc's medical license
gets suspended..

04:50.750 --> 04:52.375
(Jeffries)
'And now he can't
pay the bills'

04:52.458 --> 04:55.458
but he has a million
in life insurance on the
wife.

04:55.542 --> 04:58.375
Ain't that sweet. She ends up
shot in her own living room.

04:58.458 --> 04:59.959
Gun was never found?

05:00.041 --> 05:04.500
No, just a receipt for a .38
Chase bought months earlier.

05:04.583 --> 05:06.417
Guy's a doctor living
in Chestnut Hill.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.041
How's he hard-pressed
for cash?

05:08.125 --> 05:09.959
Well, says here he was pulling

05:10.041 --> 05:11.083
in ten grand a month

05:11.166 --> 05:12.709
but spending 14.

05:12.792 --> 05:14.625
It was the '80s, Lil.

05:14.709 --> 05:18.500
Why save for a rainy day when
the sun's always shinin'?

05:18.583 --> 05:19.959
So are we
thinkin'
this dead junkie

05:20.041 --> 05:22.208
might've been half
of this intruder
team?

05:22.291 --> 05:23.625
She's got the doctor's ring.

05:23.709 --> 05:25.709
New day
for the blonde-shaggy story.

05:25.792 --> 05:29.333
Lousy alibi, but Chase has
been
sticking to it a long time.

05:36.917 --> 05:40.000
You were quite the news
item in '82 Dr. Chase.

05:40.083 --> 05:41.417
(Jeffries)
'City follows your trial'

05:41.500 --> 05:43.750
like it was
the world series.

05:43.834 --> 05:46.667
Yes.
It's called Schadenfreude.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.709
Uh, we're dumb cops
so you'll have to

05:50.792 --> 05:52.041
talk down to us.

05:52.125 --> 05:54.834
Taking pleasure in other
people's misfortune.

05:54.917 --> 05:57.625
Works best if the other's
got a long way to fall.

05:57.709 --> 05:59.667
Rich doctor,
beautiful wife

05:59.750 --> 06:01.208
suddenly hits a wall?

06:01.291 --> 06:05.667
And now he lives in a box
with the scum of society.

06:05.750 --> 06:07.417
Makes you feel good
about your life, right?

06:07.500 --> 06:10.750
No, there was also a rich
stack
of evidence against you.

06:10.834 --> 06:12.083
(Rush)
'Like the gun
you bought'

06:12.166 --> 06:13.583
just before Lindsay was shot.

06:13.667 --> 06:16.166
That was for me, not her.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.291
I had dark days.

06:17.375 --> 06:20.959
And your flimsy
intruder story?

06:21.041 --> 06:24.291
If I were a liar, I would've
thought of something better.

06:26.083 --> 06:28.166
You recognize this ring?

06:31.542 --> 06:34.291
Lindsay gave it to me
when I graduated med school.

06:34.375 --> 06:36.709
'How did you get it?'

06:36.792 --> 06:39.083
Tell us about
the patient you
lost.

06:40.709 --> 06:42.750
Alan?

06:42.834 --> 06:45.709
He and Diane
were our best friends.

06:45.792 --> 06:48.041
I made this mistake and it
changed the course

06:48.125 --> 06:49.125
of all of our lives.

06:49.208 --> 06:52.083
Especially when Diane sued you.

06:52.166 --> 06:54.500
I couldn't face her.

06:54.583 --> 06:57.333
I...shrank.

06:58.417 --> 07:01.542
But Lindsay didn't.

07:12.250 --> 07:15.000
We shouldn't be here.

07:15.083 --> 07:17.166
Yes, we should.
Alan was our friend.

07:17.250 --> 07:20.166
What can I say to her?
I don't have any words.

07:20.250 --> 07:22.041
You will. I know it.

07:22.125 --> 07:23.500
You always do.

07:37.250 --> 07:40.041
Diane...we are so sorry.

07:41.709 --> 07:43.709
How can you come here?

07:43.792 --> 07:46.667
We loved Alan.

07:46.750 --> 07:48.542
You killed him.

07:49.458 --> 07:50.709
He didn't, Diane.

07:50.792 --> 07:52.709
It was a horrible accident--

07:52.792 --> 07:55.291
I've contacted a lawyer.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.208
Diane, no--

07:57.291 --> 08:00.375
I want to see you
lose something, too.

08:00.458 --> 08:02.458
I'm sorry for your loss.

08:02.542 --> 08:05.166
And you'll be sorry
your

08:19.250 --> 08:21.375
(Jeffries)
'Sounds like a threat.'

08:21.458 --> 08:24.250
She was in shock.
Grieving.

08:24.333 --> 08:27.083
That's when people do things
they couldn't normally
stomach.

08:27.166 --> 08:30.750
My wife was killed by
a blonde woman and a shaggy
man.

08:30.834 --> 08:32.750
Diane had brown hair.

08:32.834 --> 08:34.333
(Jeffries)
'Still, no one had motive'

08:34.417 --> 08:36.875
like she did.

08:36.959 --> 08:39.709
It's not possible.

08:39.792 --> 08:42.792
We weren't those kind of people.

08:42.875 --> 08:44.625
No. No one ever is.

08:50.792 --> 08:52.542
Diane Moore?

08:53.500 --> 08:54.542
Do I know you?

08:54.625 --> 08:56.500
I'm Detective Valens,
homicide.

08:56.583 --> 08:58.250
Nice ride.

08:58.333 --> 09:00.375
Well, it gets me there.

09:00.458 --> 09:01.834
It's about, uh...

09:01.917 --> 09:03.750
Lindsay Chase.

09:06.875 --> 09:08.000
What about Lindsay?

09:08.083 --> 09:09.875
We're lookin'
at her murder again.

09:09.959 --> 09:12.875
Poor Steven's been paying
for that for 20 years.

09:12.959 --> 09:14.041
"Poor" Steven?

09:14.125 --> 09:16.458
He was a good
friend,
at one time.

09:16.542 --> 09:19.125
You're singing a different
tune
than you did in '82.

09:19.208 --> 09:20.500
'The way I heard it'

09:20.583 --> 09:22.041
you gave it to Steve
and Lindsay pretty good

09:22.125 --> 09:23.625
at your husband's funeral.

09:23.709 --> 09:25.041
Sent 'em away.

09:25.125 --> 09:26.959
I was..

09:27.041 --> 09:29.625
...out of my head
when I lost Alan.

09:31.041 --> 09:34.000
- I couldn't see past the
pain.
- Yeah?

09:34.083 --> 09:36.000
I wanted their
world to crumble..

09:37.542 --> 09:38.792
...like mine had.

09:38.875 --> 09:39.959
That's why the lawsuit?

09:40.041 --> 09:42.458
And it broke them.

09:42.542 --> 09:45.375
He couldn't practice,
pay the mortgage.

09:45.458 --> 09:46.834
They were cash poor.

09:46.917 --> 09:48.625
Plus Chase got real depressed.

09:48.709 --> 09:50.458
It was a horror show.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.667
And I couldn't get enough of it.

10:07.083 --> 10:08.583
Lindsay, hi.

10:08.667 --> 10:09.625
Do you need a color?

10:09.709 --> 10:11.291
No, uh... well, yeah

10:11.375 --> 10:13.208
but that's not
why I'm here.

10:13.291 --> 10:17.291
- I'm looking for employment.
- Oh.

10:17.375 --> 10:18.667
I don't have
professional experience

10:18.750 --> 10:20.000
but I'm good with
hair and nails.

10:20.083 --> 10:21.834
Kitty! I've got aerobics

10:21.917 --> 10:23.583
in 20 minutes.

10:23.667 --> 10:24.667
Two secs, Diane.

10:24.750 --> 10:25.750
(Diane)
'No, now.'

10:25.834 --> 10:27.959
I'm the one paying you.

10:32.291 --> 10:35.125
Look, all I've got is
hair sweeping stuff.

10:35.208 --> 10:38.542
It's minimum wage
and it's your friends'
hair.

10:38.625 --> 10:41.709
They're not my friends
anymore, so I don't mind.

10:41.792 --> 10:43.458
I just need to make enough
for groceries

10:43.542 --> 10:45.000
till Steven gets better.

10:46.792 --> 10:49.208
Sure. It'll
be great,
Linds.

10:49.291 --> 10:50.542
Welcome.

10:57.166 --> 11:00.208
I was so distraught..

11:00.291 --> 11:03.542
...I actually enjoyed
watching her suffer.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.333
It wasn't
until
later I
thought..

11:06.750 --> 11:08.250
...maybe it was me.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.583
You, what?

11:10.667 --> 11:12.709
Who caused her death.

11:12.792 --> 11:14.250
Maybe the
lawsuit
drove Steven

11:14.333 --> 11:15.625
over the edge.

11:16.709 --> 11:18.792
Made him...kill her.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.959
(Stillman)
'Anything on our dead
blonde junkie?'

11:25.041 --> 11:27.041
Looked into her
glorious past.

11:27.125 --> 11:29.125
Few jobs.
Stint in rehab. Usual story.

11:29.208 --> 11:32.166
- No connect to the Chases?
- Scotty have better luck?

11:32.250 --> 11:34.250
Well, Lindsay Chase may have
taken a low rent job

11:34.333 --> 11:35.709
a few months before she died.

11:35.792 --> 11:37.125
Will's running that down.

11:37.208 --> 11:39.458
Struck out. IRS has
no record of her working

11:39.542 --> 11:43.041
at the Patrick Brea
salon, or anywhere else.

11:43.125 --> 11:44.542
What's it salon?

11:44.625 --> 11:47.208
Brea. B-r-e-a.

11:47.291 --> 11:48.500
Oh.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.083
That was

11:50.166 --> 11:53.583
Melanie Castle's employer,
January to August '82.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.458
That's the same time
Lindsay was killed.

11:55.542 --> 11:59.166
So our blonde and Lindsay Chase
were co-workers.

12:15.959 --> 12:17.250
Kitty Shaw?

12:19.667 --> 12:21.291
Katarine.

12:21.375 --> 12:22.709
Figured I'd upgrade
the name

12:22.792 --> 12:24.291
the rest of my life
would follow.

12:26.667 --> 12:30.583
Detectives Rush
and Jeffries,
homicide.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.625
We're wondering if you
remember Lindsay Chase?

12:33.709 --> 12:37.000
Of course.
She was my friend.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.625
Why don't we..

12:40.458 --> 12:41.625
What about
Melanie Castle?

12:41.709 --> 12:43.000
Oh, my God.

12:43.083 --> 12:47.333
We worked together,
like, a million years ago.

12:47.417 --> 12:49.083
Yikes. Why?

12:51.750 --> 12:53.667
Melanie died two days ago.

12:53.750 --> 12:54.750
'Heroin overdose.'

12:54.834 --> 12:57.166
Oh God, no.

12:57.250 --> 12:58.625
What does that have
to do with Lindsay?

12:58.709 --> 13:00.583
We're taking another look
at her murder.

13:00.667 --> 13:01.959
I thought
her husband killed her?

13:02.041 --> 13:03.625
We heard she might
have worked for you

13:03.709 --> 13:05.375
back at Patrick Brea salon?

13:05.458 --> 13:06.500
(Jefferies)
'That's what we hear'

13:06.583 --> 13:07.625
but there's no record of it.

13:07.709 --> 13:09.500
We paid her
under the table.

13:09.583 --> 13:11.709
Paid most of the sweepers
under the table.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.583
- Like Melanie?
- Yeah.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.291
Now those two, that..

13:16.375 --> 13:17.959
...that
was a culture clash.

13:18.041 --> 13:19.208
Melanie didn't appreciate

13:19.291 --> 13:20.834
the extra help
with the broom?

13:20.917 --> 13:23.917
I don't think Melanie
thought of Lindsay as..

13:24.000 --> 13:27.125
...a helpful presence
in her life, no.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.291
Feel better?

13:43.375 --> 13:46.291
I'm sorry.
You probably had plans.

13:46.375 --> 13:47.667
'I didn't mean
to cry at work.'

13:47.750 --> 13:49.208
Hey, I'd cry too

13:49.291 --> 13:52.083
if my super-hunk hubby was
depressed in bed all day.

13:52.166 --> 13:55.083
Plus, I thought eight hours
would add up to more than
this.

13:56.834 --> 13:58.417
Steven's gonna
pull through.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.834
He's got a million
reasons
to get out of bed.

14:01.542 --> 14:02.834
You, as one.

14:05.333 --> 14:06.750
We're talking, okay?

14:06.834 --> 14:10.792
Tell Timmy I wanted
to sit at the bar.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.458
Is this a girl thing?

14:12.542 --> 14:13.834
No, it's fine.

14:15.583 --> 14:16.834
Hi.

14:19.041 --> 14:20.417
Timmy,
this is Lindsay.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.709
Yeah, I saw you before.

14:22.792 --> 14:24.875
You're not driving
the Beemer anymore.

14:26.083 --> 14:27.375
It got repo-ed.

14:29.083 --> 14:31.041
If you got
money problems

14:31.125 --> 14:32.917
that hair sweeping job isn't
going to help you out

14:33.000 --> 14:35.583
but I know about other stuff..

14:35.667 --> 14:37.709
...real stuff that
could help you out.

14:37.792 --> 14:39.834
She's not like that.
Take a chill.

14:39.917 --> 14:42.959
Okay, I could see that
she's classy, okay?

14:43.041 --> 14:44.750
Don't have to point it out.

14:52.375 --> 14:53.625
I wanna go.

14:55.291 --> 14:57.375
- Now.
- Why?

14:59.709 --> 15:01.041
I just got one gulp down, what..

15:01.125 --> 15:02.375
Psycho!

15:04.709 --> 15:07.166
Mel!

15:07.250 --> 15:09.709
So Melanie was a little
sensitive about her boyfriend

15:09.792 --> 15:11.291
making eyes at Lindsay?

15:11.375 --> 15:14.333
Sounds like she wasn't too
crazy about her before that.

15:14.417 --> 15:17.458
She kind of felt Lindsay
was lording over us

15:17.542 --> 15:19.583
but it wasn't like that.

15:21.166 --> 15:23.500
Know where Timmy ended up?

15:23.583 --> 15:25.375
Jail? Halfway house?

15:25.458 --> 15:28.583
Something
sensational like that.

15:28.667 --> 15:30.166
Have you..

15:30.250 --> 15:32.291
Have you ever thought
about doing a rinse?

15:32.375 --> 15:34.000
Uh..

15:34.083 --> 15:35.333
...sometimes.

15:35.417 --> 15:36.834
You could go copper.

15:36.917 --> 15:39.083
You've got
the skin for it.

15:39.166 --> 15:41.750
I'll think about it.

15:45.333 --> 15:47.000
- Hey.
- Scotty.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.333
- Timothy Horan.
- How's he lookin'?

15:49.417 --> 15:50.709
(Valens)
'Well, shaggy.'

15:50.792 --> 15:52.959
Starting in '83,
methamphetamine

15:53.041 --> 15:55.000
methamphetamine,
methamphetamine.

15:55.083 --> 15:57.667
Three-time loser
with a blonde girlfriend.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.792
Who hated Lindsay Chase.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.083
Go pick him up.

16:01.166 --> 16:02.709
Think so.

16:02.792 --> 16:05.125
Oh, Scotty, I got
somethin' for you.

16:06.917 --> 16:08.208
- Who's this?
- A doctor.

16:08.291 --> 16:09.709
A grief counselor.

16:09.792 --> 16:11.041
Well, I don't
need that,
boss.

16:11.125 --> 16:12.500
- Can't hurt, can it?
- Boss--

16:12.583 --> 16:15.208
You never talk
about it, Scotty.

16:15.291 --> 16:17.709
I do better not talking.

16:17.792 --> 16:19.667
Alright. Throw it away.

16:37.834 --> 16:39.125
Timmy Horan?

16:43.333 --> 16:44.750
I ain't done
nothing wrong, officers.

16:44.834 --> 16:45.750
I live straight now.

16:45.834 --> 16:48.125
Sober except for beer.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.208
So this is how
you're making it by?

16:50.291 --> 16:51.250
With your Windex?

16:51.333 --> 16:52.542
I tried working regular

16:52.625 --> 16:53.917
it just took too
much out of me.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.667
Well, see what you
can muster up for this.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.500
We're here about
Lindsay Chase.

16:59.792 --> 17:01.583
You and your girlfriend
Melanie knew her.

17:01.667 --> 17:02.834
(Valens)
'Yeah, you two fit
the description'

17:02.917 --> 17:04.250
of the couple
Steven Chase saw

17:04.333 --> 17:05.500
bolting out of his house
that night.

17:05.583 --> 17:07.208
Whoa.
Lindsay was my friend.

17:07.291 --> 17:09.667
Is that what you call girls
you got a mission to bang?

17:09.750 --> 17:11.291
There was sparks.
That was mutual.

17:11.375 --> 17:13.083
Not how we heard it, Timmy.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.542
(Vera)
We heard Melanie
hated Lindsay

17:14.625 --> 17:16.125
for acting like she
was better than you two.

17:16.208 --> 17:18.000
Yeah, she got real
bent out of shape at
you

17:18.083 --> 17:19.458
for droolin' over Lindsay.

17:19.542 --> 17:21.250
(Vera)
'So maybe you made
it up to Melanie'

17:21.333 --> 17:22.875
by taking the lady down.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.834
Nah-uh. Me and Lindsay
made a true bond.

17:25.917 --> 17:29.333
- She came to me for help.
- Yeah? How'd that go?

17:29.417 --> 17:32.166
She asked me if it was really
true I could make money.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.291
And what did you say?

17:33.375 --> 17:34.834
I said,
"yeah, for you? Sure.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.458
I just need a place to cook."

17:54.834 --> 17:56.625
Kitty, my house
smells like pee.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.250
Steven's coming home
tomorrow.

17:58.333 --> 18:00.375
We'll roast coffee grounds.
That'll cover it.

18:01.417 --> 18:03.208
Hey, those were
a wedding gift.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.875
They work good.

18:06.750 --> 18:07.834
Look at me.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.458
I'm a doctor's wife.

18:09.542 --> 18:10.834
That's Steven's ring.

18:10.917 --> 18:13.166
He's gained weight.
It doesn't fit him.

18:13.250 --> 18:14.166
Aw.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.291
Put it back, Melanie.

18:15.375 --> 18:17.041
Why? You got her shirt on.

18:17.125 --> 18:18.333
'Cause Lindsay
gave it to me.

18:18.417 --> 18:20.166
I didn't lift it.
Put it back.

18:22.417 --> 18:23.834
After this, no more.

18:23.917 --> 18:25.917
It's not right, all this
in your nice house, okay?

18:28.083 --> 18:29.333
Hey.

18:39.458 --> 18:40.750
He's here.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.583
So, I only need half.

18:59.667 --> 19:01.208
That's only $3,000.

19:01.291 --> 19:02.542
Lindsay..

19:03.875 --> 19:06.542
It's $2,500 now.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.250
Okay, Mike.

19:08.333 --> 19:09.834
No.

19:09.917 --> 19:11.792
What did you say?

19:11.875 --> 19:14.041
Lindsay, don't.

19:14.125 --> 19:16.458
Take it all. $6,000.

19:16.542 --> 19:17.709
A deal's a deal.

19:17.792 --> 19:20.291
Except when it's not.

19:20.375 --> 19:22.000
I could kill you right now

19:22.083 --> 19:24.208
take the whole
batch for
nothing..

19:24.291 --> 19:25.583
...if I wanted to.

19:32.834 --> 19:35.125
Take the deal
or leave my house.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.417
I never seen anything like it.

19:45.500 --> 19:46.917
You don't talk
to Mike like that.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.083
- He was into big things.
- What kind of things?

19:49.166 --> 19:50.500
Big money things.

19:50.583 --> 19:52.125
You tell Lindsay
about the big money?

19:52.208 --> 19:53.625
Well, yeah.
She was real curious

19:53.709 --> 19:55.583
about the stuff he did.

19:55.667 --> 19:58.709
Money laundering,
insurance scams.

19:58.792 --> 20:00.959
You know if Lindsay
and Mike ever met again?

20:01.041 --> 20:03.583
She'd be dead if they did.

20:03.667 --> 20:05.792
Which she is, Tim.

20:16.041 --> 20:18.166
Looks like Lindsay was getting
in over her head

20:18.250 --> 20:20.125
trying to make some
quick cash.

20:20.208 --> 20:22.250
Fell in with a bad crowd
speed freaks.

20:22.333 --> 20:24.750
It could be why she didn't tell
her husband about the salon job.

20:24.834 --> 20:25.959
Didn't want him meeting

20:26.041 --> 20:27.625
the lowlives
she was hanging with.

20:27.709 --> 20:30.417
We think her slide might have
ended with this Mike Doherty?

20:30.500 --> 20:31.875
Well, despite what
Timmy
said about him

20:31.959 --> 20:33.208
the guy ain't
got a record.

20:33.291 --> 20:35.125
(Will)
'Worked under the radar,
made a pile'

20:35.208 --> 20:37.125
collecting insurance
from staged robberies.

20:37.208 --> 20:39.000
With some meth deals
on the side.

20:39.083 --> 20:40.709
What's Mike up to these days?

20:40.792 --> 20:44.333
He owns Doherty Systems
a home security store.

20:44.417 --> 20:45.542
'Moved up in the world.'

20:45.625 --> 20:47.959
Put his cat burglar
skills to use.

20:48.041 --> 20:50.291
I'm gonna get Scotty,
drop in on Mike.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.750
See if he and
Lindsay
met again.

20:52.834 --> 20:55.500
Wonder why Kitty never mentioned
the meth cookout?

20:55.583 --> 20:57.000
You'd think cooking drugs

20:57.083 --> 20:59.291
with Williams Sonoma
would ring some bells.

21:05.333 --> 21:07.041
I can't feel my face.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.000
Southern comfort.

21:10.083 --> 21:12.500
Melts it right off.

21:12.583 --> 21:15.208
Speakin' of comfort,
how's your barmaid?

21:16.333 --> 21:18.500
Are you gonna
henpeck me now, too?

21:18.583 --> 21:20.125
I wave the red flag once.

21:20.208 --> 21:22.166
You don't heed,
it ain't my
worry.

21:23.417 --> 21:25.166
Well, she keeps
me guessin'.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.583
So, this ain't
just
a move for you?

21:30.667 --> 21:33.834
Chris. A move? Nah.

21:33.917 --> 21:36.458
Nah. I don't know..

21:36.542 --> 21:38.166
...I don't think so.

21:40.875 --> 21:41.750
What?

21:41.834 --> 21:44.125
Well, you should
figure that out.

21:44.208 --> 21:45.667
- Right.
- Soon.

21:47.625 --> 21:48.875
Yeah.

21:51.417 --> 21:54.208
(Valens)
Dead bolts, chain locks.

21:54.291 --> 21:56.041
This what you're calling
"Systems," Mike?

21:56.125 --> 21:58.625
Keep out the bad guys,
don't they?

21:58.709 --> 22:01.041
(Vera)
'You'd know, I guess.'

22:01.125 --> 22:02.208
Don't get your meaning.

22:02.291 --> 22:03.417
Your customers
know they're being

22:03.500 --> 22:04.875
protected by a criminal?

22:04.959 --> 22:06.375
Never been arrested in my life.

22:06.458 --> 22:08.917
So what can you tell us
about Lindsay Chase?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.667
Her husband killed her.

22:10.750 --> 22:12.417
Blamed druggie intruders.

22:12.500 --> 22:14.041
I read all about it.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.083
(Valens)
'Oh, you had a closer seat
than that, Mike.'

22:16.166 --> 22:17.917
You were at Lindsay's house,
remember?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.917
To buy meth.
You threatened her?

22:21.000 --> 22:22.583
I may have
negotiated with her.

22:22.667 --> 22:25.417
"I could kill you right
now."
That a negotiation?

22:25.500 --> 22:26.959
She couldn't have
been too scared 'cause

22:27.041 --> 22:29.417
she invited me back.
Alone this time.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.709
Well, let's talk about that.

22:31.792 --> 22:34.917
The woman had guts.
That's what I remember.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.250
This real?

22:41.333 --> 22:44.500
Yes. We were in
Shanghai last
year.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.291
What's that?

22:50.333 --> 22:51.583
No. Not that.

22:51.667 --> 22:52.917
Steven's great-grandfather

22:53.000 --> 22:54.875
was a turn of the century
watercolorist.

22:54.959 --> 22:56.250
It was a wedding gift.

22:56.333 --> 22:59.792
He famous? Grandpa?

22:59.875 --> 23:02.417
Experts know him.
But you can't have it.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.583
It has sentimental value.

23:04.667 --> 23:06.792
You don't wanna do
this, sell your
house

23:06.875 --> 23:08.792
don't waste my time.

23:08.875 --> 23:12.917
I told you, we can't.
He'd fall apart.

23:16.333 --> 23:19.000
Then here it is,
the night of the job

23:19.083 --> 23:21.250
I'll call you from
the mini-mart on Highland.

23:21.333 --> 23:25.000
I'll ring twice and hang up.
You got it?

23:25.083 --> 23:26.083
Yeah.

23:26.166 --> 23:28.709
That call is your
five-minute
warning.

23:28.792 --> 23:31.709
Get upstairs,
turn
out the lights.

23:31.792 --> 23:32.959
Okay.

23:33.041 --> 23:36.500
Next morning,
call the cops.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.083
And then you'll
wait six months

23:38.166 --> 23:39.792
to collect the insurance.

23:39.875 --> 23:41.250
I can't wait,
I need the money.

23:41.333 --> 23:44.500
- You can't look needy.
- I am needy.

23:44.583 --> 23:48.041
Six months,
or we don't do this.

23:50.583 --> 23:52.041
Fine.

23:52.125 --> 23:54.667
We split
the insurance money..

23:54.750 --> 23:59.625
...I sell your stuff
for cash, which I
keep.

23:59.709 --> 24:00.959
What are you doing?

24:01.041 --> 24:03.333
You're high
maintenance.
I need a bonus.

24:03.417 --> 24:04.750
I'll take this.

24:04.834 --> 24:06.917
Just the deal. Not this.

24:09.083 --> 24:10.667
No this..

24:10.750 --> 24:12.041
...no deal.

24:12.959 --> 24:14.208
No.

24:19.542 --> 24:21.875
She buttoned up. No sale.

24:21.959 --> 24:23.375
And you just let that happen.

24:23.458 --> 24:26.583
I had 30 other deals going.
I didn't need her.

24:26.667 --> 24:30.125
Gal gets you all worked up
and you just walk away?

24:31.542 --> 24:33.875
Nobody gets me all worked up.

24:33.959 --> 24:37.125
And her dying a week later,
that's coincidence?

24:37.208 --> 24:39.875
I wasn't thinking about her
a week later.

24:39.959 --> 24:42.250
She wasted enough of my time.

24:44.125 --> 24:47.208
I still can't get used
to 50 bucks for a haircut.

24:47.291 --> 24:50.667
Even now I make a livin',
I hate to spend money.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.375
Mm, not me.

24:52.458 --> 24:56.583
The minute I wasn't scraping
by,
I spent like it was my job.

24:56.667 --> 24:59.041
Look at yourself, Lilly.

24:59.125 --> 25:01.208
So, Kitty, how come
you didn't tell us

25:01.291 --> 25:03.500
about Lindsay
and the meth?

25:05.083 --> 25:08.291
She was my friend.
I-I was protecting her.

25:08.375 --> 25:10.083
How's that work?

25:10.166 --> 25:12.709
She was ashamed of
how desperate she was.

25:12.792 --> 25:14.542
She wouldn't want
people knowing
that

25:14.625 --> 25:16.750
she had a bunch of
cretins
turning her nice house

25:16.834 --> 25:18.500
into a meth lab.

25:18.583 --> 25:20.583
Well, I'm not
judging Lindsay.

25:20.667 --> 25:24.667
She was a good person
in a tough spot.

25:24.750 --> 25:27.083
You know, I might as well
tell you the worst, then.

25:29.333 --> 25:31.750
She stooped even lower
than that.

25:31.834 --> 25:33.667
This have something
to do with Mike?

25:34.959 --> 25:36.875
- Timmy.
- Melanie's guy?

25:36.959 --> 25:39.750
Kid was tripping over himself
to get with Lindsay.

25:39.834 --> 25:41.834
She knew it.

25:41.917 --> 25:43.250
And she needed someone
to help her

25:43.333 --> 25:44.625
with what she was planning.

25:54.875 --> 25:57.125
You know what I think?

25:57.208 --> 26:00.250
I think people
underestimate you.

26:00.333 --> 26:01.583
Yeah?

26:01.667 --> 26:02.917
You're sweet.

26:04.041 --> 26:05.250
And you're fun.

26:05.333 --> 26:06.917
I'm fun, huh?

26:07.000 --> 26:08.834
And you're smart.

26:08.917 --> 26:10.417
You are so sexy.

26:13.792 --> 26:15.375
I need smart.

26:18.542 --> 26:20.041
What's goin' on?

26:20.125 --> 26:22.458
Me and her are
talkin'.
Beat it.

26:24.208 --> 26:27.166
- Where's Melanie?
- Cousin's funeral.

26:27.250 --> 26:29.041
Butt out.

26:29.125 --> 26:31.417
How about some more
peanuts, Timmy?

26:31.500 --> 26:32.667
Yeah.

26:32.750 --> 26:34.000
Comin' up.

26:37.375 --> 26:39.583
What are you doin', Linds?

26:39.667 --> 26:42.041
Just hangin'
with Timmy.

26:42.125 --> 26:44.959
You mean you're
shaking your ass for him.

26:45.041 --> 26:46.333
What's going on?

26:47.000 --> 26:49.417
Um..

26:51.417 --> 26:55.166
You know how that guy Mike
pulled the plug on the
robbery?

26:55.250 --> 26:56.834
'Cause you wouldn't
give it up for him.

26:56.917 --> 26:58.291
And that was the right thing.

26:58.375 --> 27:00.709
But I thought if
I got someone
else

27:00.792 --> 27:02.208
to do it..

27:02.291 --> 27:05.000
Someone I could control.

27:05.083 --> 27:07.542
Linds, look at me.

27:07.625 --> 27:09.750
That's not the kind of
people we are.

27:09.834 --> 27:11.583
We don't work it
for twerps like Timmy.

27:11.667 --> 27:13.208
We're above that.

27:13.291 --> 27:14.792
You just gotta
hang in there.

27:17.375 --> 27:19.792
You know what song
Steven loves?

27:21.917 --> 27:24.208
"Don't stop
thinkin'
about tomorrow."

27:24.291 --> 27:26.875
That is so true, Linds.

27:26.959 --> 27:28.959
That's what I want
to hear you saying.

27:29.041 --> 27:30.792
Things are gonna
get good again.

27:33.291 --> 27:35.208
Fresh nuts..

27:35.291 --> 27:36.208
Sexy.

27:36.291 --> 27:38.583
Take a hike, Timmy.

27:38.667 --> 27:41.208
You are so out of line.

27:41.291 --> 27:43.583
Lindsay, I know
I'm jumping the gun

27:43.667 --> 27:47.041
but maybe you should tell
your friend, there's sparks.

27:47.125 --> 27:49.291
I'm not making it up, right?

28:08.750 --> 28:11.041
(Rush)
'So Timmy got rejected
by Lindsay'

28:11.125 --> 28:12.917
hours before she died?

28:13.000 --> 28:14.083
Yeah, he was dreaming.

28:14.166 --> 28:16.166
She was so far
out of his league.

28:16.250 --> 28:17.625
Doesn't mean he
couldn't have lashed out

28:17.709 --> 28:20.333
at her for sending him away.

28:20.417 --> 28:21.709
I guess not.

28:23.667 --> 28:25.750
How'd he take Lindsay's death?

28:25.834 --> 28:28.458
Truth is, I don't know.

28:28.542 --> 28:30.875
He and Melanie split..

28:31.000 --> 28:33.333
...he never showed
his face at the bar again.

28:43.917 --> 28:45.125
I never..

28:47.667 --> 28:49.291
...downed so much of this..

28:50.709 --> 28:52.792
...I forgot where I was.

28:57.875 --> 29:00.041
You don't wanna play
"I never" with me.

29:02.709 --> 29:04.709
I never..

29:04.792 --> 29:07.208
'stole liquor from
my employer after hours.'

29:14.083 --> 29:15.875
I never..

29:15.959 --> 29:18.875
caused complications
for myself..

29:18.959 --> 29:21.208
...just 'cause of some guy.

29:22.500 --> 29:23.792
Worth it.

29:29.542 --> 29:34.333
I never checked my cell phone
ten times in an hour

29:34.417 --> 29:36.709
...'cause I was hoping
someone had called.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.792
What kind of someone?

29:41.875 --> 29:43.625
Complicated.

29:51.041 --> 29:52.250
Never..

29:56.750 --> 29:59.000
..pictured someone

29:59.083 --> 30:01.917
so vivid from
the night
before

30:02.000 --> 30:04.917
I missed my stop

30:05.000 --> 30:06.875
'went five miles
out of my way'

30:06.959 --> 30:08.917
before I realized.

30:13.834 --> 30:15.500
You ain't sick of me?

30:18.500 --> 30:20.166
Feels like you just got here.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.750
Oh, Lindsay Chase treated you
real bad, Timmy. Led you on.

30:46.834 --> 30:49.291
(Vera)
'Me, I can't
stand a tease.'

30:49.375 --> 30:51.583
You go down a road,
you should deliver.

30:52.625 --> 30:54.166
You tell her that?

30:54.250 --> 30:56.625
You go to Lindsay's house that
night and tell her your terms?

30:56.709 --> 30:58.291
- No.
- High-class lady like that.

30:58.375 --> 31:00.041
I bet you she
laughed in your face.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.375
She wasn't teasin' me.

31:01.458 --> 31:02.959
She denied
about the sparks.

31:03.041 --> 31:04.667
Maybe in front of her friend.

31:07.417 --> 31:09.625
Something happen
when her friend wasn't around?

31:11.166 --> 31:12.750
Before kitty had to butt in

31:12.834 --> 31:15.166
Lindsay and me were confidantes.

31:15.250 --> 31:16.417
Is that so?

31:16.500 --> 31:17.959
She told me 'bout
how it really was

31:18.041 --> 31:20.250
in that big, fancy house.

31:20.333 --> 31:21.709
'It was all roses
on the outside'

31:21.792 --> 31:25.166
but inside...she was cryin'.

31:26.875 --> 31:28.166
About what, Timmy?

31:30.583 --> 31:34.625
Her husband, 'spite of
havin' a grade A wife

31:34.709 --> 31:37.125
had a dish on the side.

31:37.208 --> 31:38.667
Steven Chase had a girlfriend?

31:38.750 --> 31:42.333
Hurt Lindsay especially bad
'cause it was her friend.

31:43.250 --> 31:46.333
Some...Diane girl.

31:48.041 --> 31:49.333
Diane?

31:50.542 --> 31:52.083
You sure about that?

31:55.000 --> 31:56.959
So, the doc
and Diane, huh?

31:57.041 --> 31:59.917
Puts a new spin on her husband
dying on his table.

32:17.792 --> 32:20.125
You know, I think
I figured it out, doc.

32:20.208 --> 32:23.875
The way you live, solipsism.

32:23.959 --> 32:26.834
Oh, I'm not Ivy league, but
I pick up a thing or two.

32:26.917 --> 32:30.083
It's the belief that you're the
only thing that really exists--

32:30.166 --> 32:31.917
- I know what it means.
- It's your world.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.625
We're just
livin'
in it. Sound
right?

32:33.709 --> 32:35.000
No, it doesn't.

32:35.083 --> 32:37.333
You had an affair
with Diane Moore.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.041
Yes.

32:42.125 --> 32:43.959
Left that part out?

32:44.041 --> 32:45.458
I wonder why.

32:45.542 --> 32:47.625
Her husband dies on
your operating table

32:47.709 --> 32:49.333
just months before
your wife gets shot

32:49.417 --> 32:51.709
clearing the way
for you and
Diane.

32:51.792 --> 32:53.375
- No.
- No?

32:53.458 --> 32:55.875
Yes, it happened.
No, I didn't plan
it.

32:55.959 --> 32:57.792
Two dead people and
all,
but who cares?

32:57.875 --> 33:01.750
It's your world, you
get what you want,
Diane.

33:01.834 --> 33:03.500
Alan dying ruined my life.

33:03.583 --> 33:05.542
- 'Cause she turned on you.
- Wrong.

33:05.625 --> 33:07.417
Then the jury didn't
buy your lame story

33:07.500 --> 33:08.875
and sent you away forever.

33:08.959 --> 33:11.917
Suddenly, the world
didn't revolve around you.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.542
The affair was nothing.

33:13.625 --> 33:16.583
Hurt Lindsay enough to bring
it up to a virtual stranger.

33:16.667 --> 33:19.750
- What stranger?
- Young buck named Timmy.

33:19.834 --> 33:23.166
A loser to the core,
but he loved Lindsay.

33:23.250 --> 33:25.417
I loved Lindsay.

33:25.500 --> 33:28.208
Nothing says that sweeter
than banging her friend.

33:31.250 --> 33:33.583
The times were indulgent.

33:33.667 --> 33:34.917
Selfish.

33:37.333 --> 33:39.917
I got caught up in it.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.333
Well, while you were
being
selfish and indulgent

33:43.417 --> 33:45.667
your wife was down on the
ground
with the rest of us

33:45.750 --> 33:47.500
trying to
scrape
out a living.

33:47.583 --> 33:49.709
- What do you mean?
- She was dealing drugs.

33:49.792 --> 33:52.250
Planning to rip off your
house
to get the insurance money.

33:52.333 --> 33:55.041
What? Lindsay?

33:56.792 --> 33:59.000
She was desperate..

33:59.083 --> 34:00.375
...to save you.

34:03.917 --> 34:06.083
Then we'd both hit
our lowest point.

34:07.500 --> 34:11.208
Funny thing is, that's when
we found each other again.

34:23.709 --> 34:25.625
Steven, what are you
doing in the dark?

34:30.041 --> 34:31.750
I've ruined our lives.

34:33.875 --> 34:35.542
What are you doing?

34:38.250 --> 34:40.208
Who are you dressed
like that for?

34:40.291 --> 34:41.375
No one.

34:41.458 --> 34:42.625
You seeing someone?

34:42.709 --> 34:44.417
No, Steven,
give me the gun.

34:44.500 --> 34:47.041
I wouldn't blame you.

34:47.125 --> 34:48.875
Please, give it to me.

34:51.500 --> 34:52.792
Without me..

34:54.834 --> 34:56.500
...you could get your life back.

35:00.291 --> 35:02.000
This is my life..

35:06.583 --> 35:07.875
...us.

35:17.125 --> 35:18.792
I miss you.

35:21.041 --> 35:23.709
If you leave..

35:23.792 --> 35:26.291
...I don't know what
will happen to me.

35:28.291 --> 35:30.542
I've been so lost.

35:31.792 --> 35:34.583
I just wanna get
away from here, okay?

35:38.125 --> 35:39.375
Okay.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.166
Honey, yes.

35:46.417 --> 35:48.208
We'll sell the house

35:48.291 --> 35:50.375
and we'll leave.

35:50.458 --> 35:52.709
Okay?

35:52.792 --> 35:55.125
I just wanna be with you.

36:04.125 --> 36:06.208
Will you go
upstairs with
me?

36:16.375 --> 36:18.667
You go. I'll
be right there.

36:26.792 --> 36:29.500
I love you, babe.

36:29.583 --> 36:30.875
I love you.

36:35.875 --> 36:40.041
I went upstairs and...
heard the shot.

36:42.458 --> 36:45.500
End of Lindsay...and me.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.208
You said the phone rang twice?

36:52.875 --> 36:54.125
What does that mean?

36:54.208 --> 36:56.375
Two rings and hang up.

36:56.458 --> 36:57.917
That was your
signal, Mike.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.834
Except the deal was off.
Remember?

36:59.917 --> 37:01.291
Then how come
we have a phone call

37:01.375 --> 37:03.834
coming from a convenience
store on Highland

37:03.917 --> 37:06.834
minutes before
Lindsay's murder?

37:06.917 --> 37:08.125
You tell me.

37:08.208 --> 37:09.959
(Will)
'Your plan was in motion.'

37:10.041 --> 37:12.291
'You telling us you
weren't a part of it?'

37:12.375 --> 37:14.208
I hope you got more
than a phone call.

37:14.291 --> 37:16.125
You're afraid we're
wasting your time, Mike?

37:16.208 --> 37:17.875
Like Lindsay wasted yours?

37:19.709 --> 37:21.750
You didn't answer me.

37:21.834 --> 37:24.000
Is this all you have?

37:24.083 --> 37:25.709
No, it ain't.

37:27.500 --> 37:28.959
We were just
wasting our time

37:29.041 --> 37:30.250
looking into your finances

37:30.333 --> 37:31.792
and came up with
something interesting.

37:31.875 --> 37:34.083
Seems Doherty Systems
has been receiving payments

37:34.166 --> 37:38.041
from Katarine salon
since the early '80s.

37:38.125 --> 37:40.583
Now, why would Kitty
be paying Mike?

37:40.667 --> 37:42.834
- That's pretty mysterious.
- 'Yeah.'

37:42.917 --> 37:45.041
You two secretly
family, Mike?

37:46.208 --> 37:48.166
I ain't talking.

37:48.250 --> 37:50.834
Okay. We'll talk to Kitty.

37:50.917 --> 37:52.417
Well, that
should be easy.

37:52.500 --> 37:55.166
I mean, you know how
these hair dressers are.

37:55.250 --> 37:56.959
Talk, talk, talk.

37:57.041 --> 37:58.291
I was there.

37:59.792 --> 38:01.458
Were you?

38:01.542 --> 38:03.583
But I didn't kill her.

38:03.667 --> 38:04.709
I can prove it.

38:04.792 --> 38:06.041
How?

38:07.250 --> 38:09.458
I have the gun.

38:09.542 --> 38:11.417
With her prints on it.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.041
That's why she pays me.

38:14.208 --> 38:16.166
So, kitty was the blonde?

38:30.625 --> 38:31.875
Keep a lookout.

38:31.959 --> 38:33.250
What?

38:42.166 --> 38:43.750
You're supposed
to be out of here.

38:43.834 --> 38:45.917
The plan is off.
What are you doing here?

38:47.625 --> 38:49.583
- Kitty?
- Linds, go upstairs.

38:49.667 --> 38:50.834
Me and mike can do
this whole thing
right

38:50.917 --> 38:52.166
and you can
get your money.

38:52.250 --> 38:53.542
I don't wanna do
this anymore, Kitty.

38:53.625 --> 38:55.375
You don't have to "do"
anything. I took care
of it.

38:55.458 --> 38:57.542
This is a mess.
You said it was set.

39:00.125 --> 39:02.458
(Kitty)
'Lindsay..'

39:02.542 --> 39:04.709
I gave him what he wanted,
so don't worry.

39:04.792 --> 39:07.458
Everything's gonna be okay,
just like I said.

39:07.542 --> 39:08.917
Why did you do that?

39:09.000 --> 39:12.500
Well, duh.
For...you.

39:12.583 --> 39:14.458
For...tomorrow.

39:14.542 --> 39:16.542
Your better tomorrows.

39:16.625 --> 39:18.583
Like it? It's my
Stevie Nicks thing.

39:18.667 --> 39:20.667
Are you crazy?

39:20.750 --> 39:22.917
You're the one who talked
about the song.

39:25.583 --> 39:27.709
Steven's
upstairs.
Just please go.

39:27.792 --> 39:30.000
Yeah, no problem.
This is way too sloppy.

39:30.083 --> 39:32.750
Why are you pissed at me?

39:32.834 --> 39:34.667
I'm doing this as your friend.

39:34.750 --> 39:38.041
This is crazy. I was crazy,
okay? I'm not like this.

39:38.125 --> 39:39.583
And I am.

39:43.542 --> 39:46.208
I am like this, I guess. Right?

39:49.208 --> 39:51.125
We're selling the house
and leaving here

39:51.208 --> 39:52.458
leaving this all behind.

39:52.542 --> 39:54.208
So, just go.

39:54.291 --> 39:55.583
You got it.

39:59.166 --> 40:00.625
- No!
- Hey!

40:00.709 --> 40:01.959
Kitty, please!

40:02.041 --> 40:05.083
I thought I was, like
your closest friend.

40:06.834 --> 40:08.125
Put that down!

40:08.792 --> 40:11.291
Kitty...please.

40:11.875 --> 40:13.125
Was I?

40:14.000 --> 40:16.208
Kitty, my God.

40:16.291 --> 40:18.625
I just wanna know

40:18.709 --> 40:20.709
was I your friend?

40:20.792 --> 40:22.792
Did you ever even care?

40:22.875 --> 40:25.166
Yes! Fine!
Whatever! Please!

40:25.250 --> 40:28.041
'Just get out.
Get out of my life.'

40:31.000 --> 40:32.166
(Steven)
'Lindsay?'
