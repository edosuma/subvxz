00:08.940 --> 00:10.810
Laura Fraser was young and she was pretty

00:10.860 --> 00:14.130
and she was murdered in her
own home by an intruder.

00:14.180 --> 00:17.370
We will be interviewing internally
for the Chief Super job.

00:17.420 --> 00:19.570
- You should be confident.
- Really?

00:19.620 --> 00:21.290
You said you'd let me run Highwater.

00:21.340 --> 00:24.170
- Did you mean that?
- Yes. Crime doesn't go away,

00:24.220 --> 00:27.210
it just needs to be controlled.

00:27.260 --> 00:30.170
Serbian Mafia. What's
Athif doing with them?

00:30.220 --> 00:32.020
Buying guns.

00:33.340 --> 00:36.570
I want her here in safe
accommodation before Athif gets back.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.930
- Is this it? I'm not moving my son in there.
- We had to move you fast.

00:39.980 --> 00:41.570
It's safe, that's what counts.

00:41.620 --> 00:45.290
I think you ought to know the Laura
Fraser cold case is still open.

00:46.980 --> 00:49.410
- You're lying. Why are you
lying to me? - I'm not.

00:49.460 --> 00:51.660
You and Walker are coming
after me, aren't you?

01:55.700 --> 01:58.210
A firebomb through the window. Athif's MO.

01:58.260 --> 02:00.610
How did he find her?
We've kept it so tight.

02:00.660 --> 02:02.740
Well, somebody talked, didn't they?

02:04.020 --> 02:08.289
OK, so, DS Bevan and DI
Morris are going to take you

02:08.340 --> 02:10.810
to your new accommodation.
Make sure you're safe.

02:10.860 --> 02:13.490
- Where is this new place?
- We'd better not discuss that.

02:13.540 --> 02:15.540
We don't want Athif to be informed again.

02:17.620 --> 02:19.860
Excuse me, are you
saying I informed Athif?

02:21.060 --> 02:23.450
I'd never talk to Athif.
I want him sent down.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.260
What were you doing here, anyway?

02:27.060 --> 02:30.010
You rang me. You said Za was on
her own, that I should come over.

02:30.060 --> 02:32.770
What... I didn't know
you even knew Zaheera.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.130
Don't make this any worse
for yourself by lying.

02:35.180 --> 02:37.460
I came to your house. We discussed it.

02:38.260 --> 02:39.160
What?

02:40.420 --> 02:42.450
I told you about the
cold case. I helped you.

02:42.500 --> 02:45.410
I have no idea what you're talking
about. George, sort that out.

02:45.460 --> 02:48.330
Za, you've got to believe me. I
didn't do this. She set this up.

02:48.380 --> 02:51.330
This is ridiculous. Bancroft
told me to come over. Za!

02:51.380 --> 02:52.770
- OK, stay with her.
- Za!

02:52.820 --> 02:56.170
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine. That's all.

02:56.220 --> 02:57.820
All right.

03:19.220 --> 03:21.220
- Who is it?
- It's Anya.

03:43.100 --> 03:44.980
I come from Highwater.

03:47.460 --> 03:50.620
Athif and I, er, we went out for a bit.

03:52.620 --> 03:55.620
He er... reckoned he owned me.

03:56.940 --> 03:59.810
When I got into college, he flipped.

03:59.860 --> 04:01.860
I never went home.

04:05.540 --> 04:09.530
When you were vetted by the police,
didn't you tell them about that, or what?

04:09.580 --> 04:12.980
- They'd never have given me the
job if I had. - That's not true.

04:18.100 --> 04:21.089
Did Bancroft know about
the Highwater connection?

04:21.140 --> 04:22.460
Yeah.

04:23.620 --> 04:25.620
I told her.

04:30.500 --> 04:31.900
She's set you up.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.740
Why would she do that?

04:35.420 --> 04:37.220
Because she killed Laura Fraser.

04:38.420 --> 04:40.220
She almost admitted it last night.

04:41.340 --> 04:43.180
She murders Laura...

04:44.180 --> 04:46.380
.. then she sets it up
to look like a burglary.

04:47.180 --> 04:49.580
- What's her motive?
- Jealousy.

04:50.380 --> 04:52.170
She's in love with Tim Fraser.

04:52.220 --> 04:56.010
She makes sure she's the first copper on
the scene so they put her on the case,

04:56.060 --> 05:00.180
then she tampers with evidence, and
then she feeds Haverstock's prejudice.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.180
She gets the case closed down.

05:04.780 --> 05:09.580
So do you think she firebombed
Zaheera to drop me in it?

05:10.540 --> 05:12.340
I wouldn't put it past her.

05:14.700 --> 05:16.700
I wouldn't put anything past her.

05:17.500 --> 05:20.620
Rahid could have died. So could Zaheera.

05:21.500 --> 05:24.660
- We can't let her get
away with it. - I know.

05:26.820 --> 05:31.090
- Is Zaheera Kamara all right?
- She's nervous. Daanish is furious.

05:31.140 --> 05:34.540
- If he hated his brother before...
- What's the case against Anya Karim?

05:35.140 --> 05:38.850
She was the only person, apart from
myself, George Morris and Andy Bevan,

05:38.900 --> 05:40.530
who knew where Zaheera was.

05:40.580 --> 05:42.930
- Suspend her.
- I have, pending investigation.

05:42.980 --> 05:45.450
Sir, I need to step up
protection for Zaheera.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.130
- I need a female DS on this.
- Take whoever you want.

05:48.180 --> 05:50.780
- I'll have Katherine Stevens.
- No, no. No!

05:51.580 --> 05:54.680
You've been trying to take her
off my cold cases from the start.

05:55.140 --> 05:57.010
Why would Elizabeth do that?

05:57.060 --> 06:02.220
Stevens is investigating a case
that Elizabeth was on which was...

06:03.580 --> 06:05.580
.. mismanaged.

06:06.740 --> 06:08.340
How long ago was this?

06:09.620 --> 06:12.490
- 27 years.
- What was your role?

06:12.540 --> 06:14.940
WPC seconded to the case.

06:15.580 --> 06:18.540
Well, whatever went wrong, it's
hardly at Elizabeth's door.

06:19.460 --> 06:21.420
You need to get this in perspective.

06:21.900 --> 06:25.410
We've got an arms shipment coming
through, significant arrests to be made.

06:25.460 --> 06:28.650
This is the biggest op this
station has run in years.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.690
It's my priority.

06:30.740 --> 06:32.650
Take Katherine Stevens.

06:32.700 --> 06:35.600
Cliff, wind up the cold cases.
You've got nowhere with them.

06:37.100 --> 06:38.900
Thank you, sir.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.300
My office.

06:46.300 --> 06:48.690
Please, guv. I can't work under Bancroft.

06:48.740 --> 06:52.420
It's not my call. She asked
for you and the boss agreed.

06:54.140 --> 06:55.730
Why does she want me?

06:55.780 --> 06:57.490
She needs a woman.

06:57.540 --> 07:01.530
Taheeri's pulled the plug on the cold cases,
so there's nothing else for you to do.

07:01.580 --> 07:03.290
She wanted them closed all along.

07:03.340 --> 07:06.300
Guv... she attacked me last night.

07:08.460 --> 07:10.170
What?

07:10.220 --> 07:12.260
I think she killed Laura Fraser.

07:13.780 --> 07:15.780
It was Bancroft who was shagging Tim.

07:16.460 --> 07:19.410
- She knew him?
- She knew them both.

07:19.460 --> 07:21.460
I saw their wedding video. She's on it.

07:22.260 --> 07:23.930
Well, why didn't you tell me?

07:23.980 --> 07:25.730
She asked me not to and I believed her.

07:25.780 --> 07:27.770
Oh, Katherine.

07:27.820 --> 07:29.810
You're all over the place on this.

07:29.860 --> 07:32.370
First you think it's Tim
Fraser, now it's Bancroft.

07:32.420 --> 07:35.810
- I mean, have you got any hard evidence?
- Not at the moment, I don't, but...

07:35.860 --> 07:37.450
You're not going to get anywhere.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.730
You wanted me to carry
on with the case, guv.

07:39.780 --> 07:43.290
- You wanted something on her.
- Corruption, maybe. Negligence.

07:43.340 --> 07:45.850
Not murder. You're accusing
a senior police officer!

07:45.900 --> 07:49.020
Have you any idea what that
could mean for your career?

07:51.540 --> 07:54.530
She's popular. She's loved.

07:54.580 --> 07:56.300
She's a murderer.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.890
You're putting me in a
very difficult position

08:00.940 --> 08:02.610
even voicing these allegations.

08:02.660 --> 08:04.810
We have to do something, guv.

08:04.860 --> 08:07.010
You're under stress.

08:07.060 --> 08:10.410
I'll make an appointment for you
to see the chief medical officer.

08:10.460 --> 08:14.940
And if you value your job... you won't
repeat what you just told me to anybody.

08:25.780 --> 08:27.300
Oh, you found it all right, then.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.780
Yeah. Yeah. I've not been here before.

08:32.340 --> 08:34.340
Laura worked here.

08:35.539 --> 08:37.370
They said they weren't hiring.

08:37.419 --> 08:40.929
But she tells them she'll get their
customers to drink twice the amount.

08:42.179 --> 08:43.780
And they liked the cheek of her.

08:44.140 --> 08:45.740
Gave her a job.

08:46.580 --> 08:47.980
And did she?

08:49.620 --> 08:51.500
Get them drinking twice the amount?

08:51.980 --> 08:55.020
No doubt. She'd talk anyone into anything.

08:56.060 --> 08:58.780
- What are you drinking?
- I've got some bad news, Len.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.660
I'm off Laura's case.

09:03.260 --> 09:06.450
- What?
- I'm so sorry.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.500
Why?

09:08.780 --> 09:10.620
A reorganisation at work.

09:11.900 --> 09:14.300
- So who's on it, then?
- Nobody.

09:16.300 --> 09:19.130
- All the cold cases have been closed.
- No, they can't do that.

09:19.180 --> 09:21.170
Yes, they can.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.020
Limited resources.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.500
I'm never gonna know.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.420
I'm gonna die not knowing.

09:42.780 --> 09:44.380
Len, listen.

09:46.060 --> 09:47.700
Although we're not meant to...

09:48.700 --> 09:50.690
.. we're still working Laura's case.

09:50.740 --> 09:53.840
My colleague is looking through
forensics in her spare time.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.650
- Why would she?
- I appreciate this.

09:56.700 --> 10:00.420
Because we both wanna bring
whoever did this to justice.

10:01.780 --> 10:03.380
Yeah, right.

10:09.180 --> 10:13.330
You know who did it. Or you've
got an idea, haven't you?

10:13.380 --> 10:15.170
I can't say.

10:15.220 --> 10:17.220
Not until we have proper evidence.

10:22.540 --> 10:25.040
I was going crazy, running
through it all in my head.

10:25.620 --> 10:28.450
And then I thought the fibre
tapes that were with Forensics,

10:28.500 --> 10:30.210
they were adjacent to the bite marks.

10:30.260 --> 10:32.050
They might contain some LTD.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.700
- What's LTD?
- Low template DNA.

10:35.180 --> 10:38.210
So I took the fibre tapes to my
old professor at the university.

10:38.260 --> 10:40.100
Low template's her specialisation.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.490
We raised a profile.

10:42.540 --> 10:44.650
It's not complete, but it's clear enough.

10:44.700 --> 10:47.940
All we need now is Bancroft's
DNA, see if it matches this.

10:48.860 --> 10:51.650
How are we gonna get that? She
won't let us anywhere near her.

10:51.700 --> 10:54.610
Getting a profile from someone
who shares her genetic markers.

10:54.660 --> 10:57.660
A relative who we, or you, have access to.

11:02.660 --> 11:06.360
What qualities do you think you have
that would make you right for this role?

11:09.420 --> 11:11.420
I've got all the obvious ones.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.340
I'm... strong managerially.

11:17.420 --> 11:19.020
I'm a visible leader.

11:20.060 --> 11:24.460
But I hope and I believe that I could
bring more than those skills to this job.

11:27.700 --> 11:30.210
The public have lost faith in the police.

11:30.260 --> 11:34.140
They think we hide behind
our desks, ticking boxes.

11:36.180 --> 11:38.860
I'd get out there, make a difference.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.700
I'd bring people to justice who
need to be brought to justice.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.900
I'd prioritise victims,
root out perpetrators.

11:48.620 --> 11:52.420
Reward where it's due,
punish where it's required.

11:54.660 --> 11:56.260
I'd get results.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.460
Good luck, guv.

12:07.980 --> 12:09.980
I don't have a rat in hell's chance.

12:11.540 --> 12:15.460
Are you feeling better?
Everything back in perspective?

12:16.220 --> 12:18.970
If you mean do I retract what
I told you, then, no, I don't.

12:22.940 --> 12:24.380
They're ready for you.

12:33.140 --> 12:34.740
How are you?

12:36.180 --> 12:37.780
Never better.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.700
I will bring you down.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.600
I heard you'd been referred
to the medical officer.

12:51.820 --> 12:53.660
(Poor Katherine.)

13:20.520 --> 13:21.520
Joe.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.140
Joe.

13:30.540 --> 13:32.090
You're not answering my calls.

13:32.140 --> 13:33.900
Yeah, well, we as good as split.

13:34.660 --> 13:36.410
So there's nothing to talk about.

13:36.460 --> 13:38.060
No, we didn't.

13:38.940 --> 13:41.290
I was... I was just distracted that night.

13:41.340 --> 13:43.340
You're always distracted.

13:44.620 --> 13:48.330
I don't want to be with someone who puts
their job before me. You're like my mum.

13:48.380 --> 13:50.290
I am nothing like your mother.

13:50.340 --> 13:54.730
But you think that you can get your own way
about everything and that I won't mind.

13:54.780 --> 13:57.260
Well... I do.

14:00.020 --> 14:02.020
Can you just... Can you go, Katherine?

14:27.060 --> 14:28.460
What's happened?

14:32.860 --> 14:34.620
I've messed everything up.

14:39.860 --> 14:41.460
And erm...

14:43.580 --> 14:45.580
.. I think the worst thing I've done is...

14:47.820 --> 14:49.420
.. I've lost you.

14:51.180 --> 14:53.180
I'm so sorry, Joe.

15:10.420 --> 15:14.380
- Keep it down, you'll wake the street.
- You're the one that's yelling.

15:14.860 --> 15:19.620
Uh-oh. My mum's home. Shall
we... Shall we go to yours?

15:22.060 --> 15:23.860
Well, I don't mind if you don't.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.020
OK.

15:52.220 --> 15:53.820
You should stay over.

15:54.820 --> 15:57.340
It's about time Mum got
used to people staying.

16:02.740 --> 16:05.130
You know, I'm actually
thinking about moving out.

16:05.180 --> 16:08.500
My mum doesn't want me to,
but, well, I think I should.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.700
What do you think?

16:18.540 --> 16:20.140
Are you going?

16:20.780 --> 16:22.140
Yeah.

16:23.260 --> 16:24.460
Erm...

16:25.020 --> 16:27.050
- But I'll give you a call, yeah?
- Yeah.

16:27.100 --> 16:29.100
All right. Bye.

16:37.860 --> 16:39.900
Don't come between me and my son.

16:41.020 --> 16:42.780
Is that what Laura did?

16:46.820 --> 16:48.420
Did she come between you and Tim?

17:07.020 --> 17:09.770
Oh, stay and have breakfast with
me. I've got a big day today.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.569
Oh, I can't, Mum.

17:11.619 --> 17:13.730
Your shift doesn't start till 11.

17:13.780 --> 17:16.970
- I'm having breakfast with a friend.
- Katherine Stevens?

17:17.020 --> 17:19.859
I know what you're gonna say,
but we're back together, OK?

17:20.420 --> 17:24.530
The only reason she is still seeing you is
because I pulled her off her precious cold cases.

17:24.579 --> 17:27.010
You know that? She's trying
to hurt me through you.

17:27.060 --> 17:29.410
Why does everything always
have to be about you?

17:29.460 --> 17:32.450
Joe, stop seeing her. You are in
something you don't understand.

17:32.500 --> 17:36.090
Do you know how paranoid you sound? It's
the same every time I get a girlfriend.

17:36.140 --> 17:37.770
- No. It's different.
- It isn't.

17:37.820 --> 17:40.540
Joe, Joe, Joe. Please.
Please, love, let's not argue.

17:48.700 --> 17:54.010
OK, everybody. Final
briefing for the Kamara op.

17:54.060 --> 17:56.490
A vehicle containing smuggled guns

17:56.540 --> 18:00.090
is coming into Hull at 1500 hours today.

18:00.140 --> 18:02.810
Our intention is to follow said vehicle,

18:02.860 --> 18:07.500
seize the firearms and arrest all
the suspects involved, including...

18:08.500 --> 18:10.330
.. Athif Kamara.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.450
I shall be Silver Commander. Thank you.

18:15.820 --> 18:18.170
You've got to wear one
of these, all right?

18:18.220 --> 18:20.290
- Ma'am.
- No, I don't carry a gun.

18:20.340 --> 18:22.340
Yes, ma'am.

18:25.660 --> 18:26.980
Guv.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.980
- Taser.
- Great.

18:33.060 --> 18:35.450
Katherine, you're gonna be my loggist.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.130
Stay with me throughout the
op, record all my decisions.

18:38.180 --> 18:39.970
- You up to that?
- Of course.

18:40.020 --> 18:44.050
You do this well, we'll draw a line
under previous misunderstandings.

18:51.900 --> 18:53.090
Hello.

18:53.140 --> 18:55.730
Joe's DNA matches the
saliva on the fibre tapes.

18:55.780 --> 18:58.050
You've got enough to question Bancroft.

18:58.100 --> 19:00.170
You have to tell Walker.

19:00.220 --> 19:01.620
OK.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.010
[Where are you going?]

19:48.060 --> 19:51.410
From Silver. Do we have a
visual on the target vehicle?

19:51.460 --> 19:54.410
This is Golf-Nine-Nine. We have a visual.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.860
Golf-Nine-Nine has the eye. All
units, hold back. Hold back.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.220
Golf-Nine-Nine. We're on the move.

20:05.260 --> 20:07.660
Golf-Nine-Nine. Approaching rendezvous.

20:11.220 --> 20:13.810
From Silver. Remember the
briefing. Keep control.

20:13.860 --> 20:17.330
- Keep your distance. They're gonna be jumpy.
- Golf-Nine-Nine. Stand by.

20:17.380 --> 20:19.580
Subject vehicle approaching roundabout.

20:21.740 --> 20:25.690
Subject vehicle indicating west,
west, west onto the Mike-Six-Two.

20:25.740 --> 20:27.420
Mike-Six-Two.

20:30.140 --> 20:33.410
From Silver. Aerial, maintain
visual of target vehicle.

20:33.460 --> 20:35.940
Copy, Silver. Maintaining visual.

20:51.580 --> 20:54.260
Subject vehicle is indicating.
Approaching a slip.

20:56.020 --> 20:58.450
Signposted Alpha-Five-Five-Six.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.410
Surveillance One, hold back, hold back.

21:00.460 --> 21:04.290
- We'll follow the subject vehicle.
- Golf-Nine-Nine. Pulling back.

21:04.340 --> 21:05.940
Silver has the eyes.

21:06.860 --> 21:09.780
- Have we any idea where they're heading?
- Hard to tell.

21:21.220 --> 21:24.770
Right, yeah, we've been following
the van on the M62, heading west.

21:24.820 --> 21:27.370
They've turned off on the
A556. Where are they going?

21:27.420 --> 21:31.490
- I don't know road numbers.
- Erm... OK, we're on the Chester Road.

21:31.540 --> 21:35.060
There's wind turbines ahead.
Come on. Think, Daanish. Come on.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.690
- There's a farmhouse.
- Farmhouse.

21:38.740 --> 21:40.940
We used it years back.
It's set off the road.

21:42.100 --> 21:44.250
- Is it Brook Hill Farm?
- Yeah, that's it.

21:44.300 --> 21:45.740
OK. Stay standing by.

21:46.260 --> 21:47.930
All units, stand by, stand by.

21:47.980 --> 21:51.580
The destination could be a
farmhouse -- a "Brook Hill Farm".

22:06.140 --> 22:08.930
All units, hold back. Hold back.
Do not follow down the track.

22:08.980 --> 22:10.980
Do not follow down that track.

22:13.460 --> 22:15.260
OK, Stuart, go and sort out a unit.

22:16.340 --> 22:18.450
Move out! Move out!

22:18.500 --> 22:20.490
Straight down! Move out! Move out!

22:20.540 --> 22:22.140
Move! Move! Let's go!

22:36.100 --> 22:37.900
You, check we're clear.

22:41.100 --> 22:43.860
Spotters on bikes half a
mile ahead, coming your way.

22:53.260 --> 22:55.100
We're here to repair the power lines.

23:15.940 --> 23:17.940
Unload them.

23:25.220 --> 23:26.530
All good?

23:26.580 --> 23:27.980
- All good.
- [What's going on?]

23:31.980 --> 23:34.010
- Armed police!
- Get down now!

23:34.060 --> 23:36.610
- Go, go, go! Go, go, go!
- On the fucking floor!

23:41.660 --> 23:43.170
Get your hands behind your heads!

23:43.220 --> 23:44.970
Get them out!

23:46.020 --> 23:48.570
Get your camera out. I
want visuals on these.

23:48.620 --> 23:50.140
Where's Kamara? Where is he?

23:50.860 --> 23:53.490
- Find me Kamara!
- Athif's not here, guv.

23:53.540 --> 23:55.930
Come on, he's got to be.
Right, you, where's Athif?

23:56.980 --> 23:58.860
Oh, Jesus! Get fucking rid of him!

24:00.420 --> 24:02.580
Daanish, Athif's not
here. Where could he be?

24:04.740 --> 24:06.740
Right, OK. Stand by.

24:07.300 --> 24:08.970
- Scene's secure.
- Kamara's not here.

24:09.020 --> 24:11.730
I need you to search the buildings
and the whole perimeter.

24:11.780 --> 24:13.810
Katherine, that's enough on the weapons.

24:13.860 --> 24:17.130
Take the van from a distance and I
want the whole layout of the barn.

24:17.180 --> 24:20.020
- All right? - Yes, guv.
- He's got to be here.

24:21.380 --> 24:25.530
- Stuart, stand by. Any sightings
of Kamara? - Negative, guv.

24:25.580 --> 24:27.460
Yeah, any sightings, let me know.

24:28.700 --> 24:32.050
- No sign of Kamara, guv.
- All clear from the north perimeter, guv.

25:51.260 --> 25:53.260
- I-Is he?
- No pulse.

25:59.820 --> 26:02.500
No. No, please! Please don't!

26:12.500 --> 26:14.100
I need help in here!

26:14.580 --> 26:17.100
It's Kamara! He's shot Stevens!

26:17.780 --> 26:19.660
Get an ambulance! Now!

26:33.180 --> 26:36.530
- What happened? - Firearms
fucked up. The barn wasn't secure.

26:36.580 --> 26:39.850
The guv hears shots, finds the
door to the safe room, runs in,

26:39.900 --> 26:41.900
Stevens is lying on the floor.

27:15.340 --> 27:19.610
- It's OK. - 'A police officer
is critically ill tonight

27:19.660 --> 27:22.490
after being gunned down in a police raid

27:22.540 --> 27:25.610
where three dozen firearms were seized.'

27:25.660 --> 27:27.370
She put Katherine in harm's way.

27:27.420 --> 27:29.290
She knew Athif was hiding in there.

27:29.340 --> 27:32.650
Look, be careful what you
say. You can't prove any of it.

27:32.700 --> 27:36.250
She murdered Laura
Fraser, and now Katherine.

27:36.300 --> 27:38.970
If you'd listened, this
would never have happened.

27:39.020 --> 27:41.210
What Katherine told me
didn't make any sense.

27:41.260 --> 27:44.450
You'd been suspended, which didn't
help, and there was no evidence.

27:44.500 --> 27:47.770
- What did you expect me to do?
- I have evidence now.

27:47.820 --> 27:51.340
A DNA match between Laura Fraser's
body and Bancroft's son's semen.

27:57.980 --> 28:00.330
- Elizabeth.
- She's out of theatre.

28:00.380 --> 28:02.890
- Is she conscious?
- She's in an induced coma.

28:02.940 --> 28:06.810
- Impossible to tell the extent of the damage.
- The next 24 to 48 hours are critical.

28:06.860 --> 28:09.700
Sir, I am calling to
tender my resignation.

28:10.420 --> 28:13.290
Look, if there is blame,
it lies with Firearms.

28:13.340 --> 28:15.330
They gave the all-clear on the barn.

28:15.380 --> 28:18.930
IPCC will need to see you and you
will need to write a statement.

28:18.980 --> 28:20.650
I've already done that.

28:20.700 --> 28:25.220
Look, Elizabeth, I will not accept
your resignation. Understand?

28:26.020 --> 28:29.660
But I am going to take you off ops
until this whole thing's wound up.

28:30.460 --> 28:35.770
Press are organising a conference for tomorrow,
but there's no need for you to show up.

28:35.820 --> 28:37.820
No, I'll be there. Thank you, sir.

28:47.780 --> 28:48.580
Yes.

28:49.420 --> 28:51.020
Boss, I need a word.

28:56.660 --> 29:02.420
We seized firearms, believed to be imported for
distribution amongst organised-crime networks.

29:03.820 --> 29:07.460
During the operation, one man
suffered a fatal heart attack.

29:08.740 --> 29:10.820
A police officer was also shot.

29:11.980 --> 29:15.570
And that officer remains in a
critical condition. Thank you.

29:15.620 --> 29:18.140
- How is the officer?
- Will the officer make it?

29:18.700 --> 29:21.300
- What's this all about?
- No idea. Sorry, guv.

29:25.220 --> 29:27.620
Oh. I presumed this was IPCC.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.290
No, no, no. This isn't
about yesterday's op.

29:30.340 --> 29:33.450
I've got to ask you questions
about the Laura Fraser case.

29:33.500 --> 29:36.060
I told Stevens everything
I know ten times over.

29:36.580 --> 29:40.280
Just got to go through it once again,
before the file goes back in the stack.

29:40.940 --> 29:43.640
Shall we get it over with?
It really shouldn't take long.

29:47.220 --> 29:48.430
Right.

29:50.380 --> 29:53.730
11:05. Interview with Detective
Superintendent Bancroft.

29:53.780 --> 29:55.890
Hang on a minute. Are you recording this?

29:55.940 --> 29:57.940
You know the procedure. I've got to.

29:59.660 --> 30:02.180
Fine. Fine. Ask whatever you like.

30:02.860 --> 30:04.260
Right.

30:05.060 --> 30:06.260
Erm...

30:06.820 --> 30:09.780
Laura Fraser's husband, Tim Fraser...

30:15.500 --> 30:17.380
.. you knew him, yeah?

30:18.220 --> 30:20.460
Stevens told me there's a wedding video.

30:22.740 --> 30:24.940
We went to university together, yes.

30:27.300 --> 30:29.330
Good friends?

30:29.380 --> 30:31.380
I suppose, yeah. Yeah.

30:33.380 --> 30:35.380
Wasn't that a conflict of interest?

30:36.660 --> 30:40.780
I mean, you're on the investigation
team for his wife's murder and...

30:41.660 --> 30:43.850
.. you know him?

30:43.900 --> 30:46.500
Charlie Haverstock thought
it would be beneficial.

30:47.060 --> 30:50.820
We didn't have family liaison back then,
and I was assigned to look after him.

30:52.180 --> 30:53.180
Cosy.

30:54.980 --> 30:58.380
I er... kept him informed
on the case, that's all.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.860
Were you...

31:01.860 --> 31:04.490
.. in a relationship with
him before he married Laura?

31:04.540 --> 31:08.090
- What's this got to do with anything?
- I'm just trying to establish the facts.

31:08.140 --> 31:12.930
Well, I suppose it depends on
what you define as a relationship.

31:12.980 --> 31:16.500
Were you... having sex with him?

31:18.740 --> 31:21.730
No.

31:21.780 --> 31:23.850
So it didn't bother you
when he married Laura?

31:23.900 --> 31:27.580
I was going out with my ex, Brian,
by then. Why would it bother me?

31:30.180 --> 31:32.980
And you and Laura became friends?

31:34.060 --> 31:37.340
We er... We met a few
times, we went bowling.

31:38.060 --> 31:40.290
Oh, you didn't like her.

31:40.340 --> 31:41.980
I didn't have an opinion.

31:45.820 --> 31:49.980
Did you ever... visit them at their home?

31:51.260 --> 31:54.290
I erm... I don't remember.

31:54.340 --> 31:55.970
But you knew where they lived?

31:56.020 --> 31:58.500
Yeah, I... I presume so. I'm not sure.

31:59.940 --> 32:05.700
So... on the day of the murder,
when you were first on the scene...

32:06.580 --> 32:10.420
.. was it a surprise that the
woman who had been bitten...

32:13.340 --> 32:16.180
.. and stabbed 18 times...

32:20.500 --> 32:22.500
.. was the wife of your old friend?

32:24.620 --> 32:28.970
I went to the address. It was
familiar but I hadn't worked it out.

32:29.020 --> 32:32.980
When I saw Laura, it was a huge shock.

32:34.940 --> 32:37.020
And you were sure it was her? I mean...

32:38.300 --> 32:42.410
.. someone can look quite different
when they're covered in blood.

32:42.460 --> 32:45.650
- She was on her back. I could tell
it was Laura. - What did you do then?

32:45.700 --> 32:48.530
I called for backup, went
outside and I waited.

32:48.580 --> 32:51.250
- You didn't go near the body?
- No, of course not.

32:51.300 --> 32:54.100
Even then we were aware of
crime-scene contamination.

32:58.580 --> 32:59.980
So...

33:00.540 --> 33:01.940
So why...

33:02.780 --> 33:04.780
.. is your DNA...

33:05.780 --> 33:10.300
.. a match to a DNA profile
taken from Laura's body?

33:14.620 --> 33:16.620
How did you obtain my DNA?

33:17.220 --> 33:22.660
This is low template DNA taken from
the fibre tapes close to the bite.

33:23.940 --> 33:25.740
And this...

33:26.820 --> 33:29.020
.. is your son Joe's DNA.

33:32.060 --> 33:34.410
Now, as he wasn't alive in 1990,

33:34.460 --> 33:37.540
it can't have been him taking
chunks out of Laura Fraser.

33:38.020 --> 33:39.930
But you...

33:39.980 --> 33:41.580
You have a motive.

33:43.180 --> 33:45.850
You didn't want her coming
between you and Tim Fraser.

33:45.900 --> 33:51.380
You knew where she lived and you knew how to
cover it up to make it look like a burglary.

33:53.300 --> 33:55.300
It all fits, doesn't it?

33:58.740 --> 34:02.060
You're a great police officer
and you've done a lot of good.

34:02.700 --> 34:05.210
Have you been atoning all these years?

34:05.260 --> 34:07.250
I mean, what was it?

34:07.300 --> 34:09.850
Self-defence? Did she come at you?

34:09.900 --> 34:11.900
Tell me what happened.

34:12.820 --> 34:14.620
You must want to.

34:15.100 --> 34:19.739
27 years -- that's a long
time to carry a secret.

34:23.540 --> 34:26.340
I've kept quiet about
all this because I...

34:29.620 --> 34:31.420
Yeah, I didn't think...

34:33.460 --> 34:35.580
.. that it would benefit anyone to know.

34:36.580 --> 34:41.340
But as you've... made it your
business to dig into my past...

34:45.940 --> 34:50.900
Familial DNA doesn't just create
a link between mother and son...

34:54.739 --> 34:56.739
.. but also father and son.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.620
What's Brian got to do with it?

35:03.220 --> 35:05.220
Brian's not Joe's father.

35:07.540 --> 35:09.460
Tim Fraser is.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.730
Tim was all over Laura's body that day.

35:15.780 --> 35:18.010
He broke the crime scene
seal, he lifted her up.

35:18.060 --> 35:20.970
It's Tim Fraser's DNA you
have on your fibre tape.

35:21.020 --> 35:23.610
He and I had a brief
relationship after Laura died.

35:23.660 --> 35:26.490
I slept with a man who needed
comforting. That is all.

35:26.540 --> 35:29.090
We can clear this all up
by you offering your DNA.

35:29.140 --> 35:32.850
I have just arrested eight men
and seized three-dozen guns,

35:32.900 --> 35:34.890
and you are giving me this bullshit?

35:34.940 --> 35:38.970
Jesus Christ, Cliff! You used to
be such a good police officer.

35:39.020 --> 35:40.730
What the fuck has happened to you?

35:40.780 --> 35:43.410
This stops now! All I've
heard is insinuation.

35:43.460 --> 35:45.450
Guv, I don't want any of this getting out.

35:45.500 --> 35:48.770
Joe does not know the truth about
his father. This is gonna hurt him!

35:48.820 --> 35:52.610
This is a purposeful campaign
to destroy a fellow colleague

35:52.660 --> 35:54.250
and I will not have it.

35:54.300 --> 35:56.130
The least we can do is take her DNA.

35:56.180 --> 36:00.100
I do not want to hear another
word about this cold case!

36:00.940 --> 36:05.540
Put all of this back where it
belongs, in the bloody deep freeze.

37:06.900 --> 37:08.690
Are you Joe?

37:08.740 --> 37:12.530
Yeah. Who are you?

37:12.580 --> 37:14.380
I'm a friend of Katherine's.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.900
Do you want to know why she's here?

37:51.000 --> 37:51.900
Joe?

37:53.020 --> 37:55.020
Have you been to the hospital? How is she?

37:58.300 --> 38:00.780
Why didn't you tell me that
Tim Fraser's my father?

38:02.300 --> 38:06.690
He was here. I spoke to him. Does
he have any idea that I'm his son?

38:06.740 --> 38:08.730
- Whoa, whoa! Who told you that?
- Is it true?

38:08.780 --> 38:11.620
- Walker, the bastard.
- Were you ever gonna tell me?

38:12.740 --> 38:14.130
Oh.

38:14.180 --> 38:16.700
I-I was waiting for the right moment.

38:20.700 --> 38:24.690
Tim's wife, Laura... She said that you...

38:24.740 --> 38:26.730
Who said? Who have you been talking to?

38:26.780 --> 38:28.210
.. you were jealous of Laura.

38:28.260 --> 38:30.130
No, no. Listen, listen. Listen to me.

38:30.180 --> 38:33.930
No, listen. Everything you've
been told, it's not true.

38:33.980 --> 38:36.490
Walker wants the DCS job.
He's just spreading rumours.

38:36.540 --> 38:40.640
It wasn't just her that died that night.
The Forensics woman said she was pregnant.

38:41.540 --> 38:43.210
You've been talking to Anya Karim?

38:43.260 --> 38:45.330
So you got Tim back and
then you got a child.

38:45.380 --> 38:48.650
I mean, what am I? The result
of some sick revenge thing?

38:48.700 --> 38:51.370
- God, no. How can you think that?
- I know what you're like.

38:51.420 --> 38:53.730
Listen, everything you've
been told is a lie, OK?

38:53.780 --> 38:55.490
Anya Karim has been suspended.

38:55.540 --> 38:57.700
She is a bitter, bitter person.

39:00.140 --> 39:02.370
You're exhausted. You need to sleep.

39:02.420 --> 39:04.420
- No.
- No.

39:06.780 --> 39:08.780
Joe. Joe.

39:10.140 --> 39:11.540
Joe!

39:12.220 --> 39:13.810
You have to believe me. It's lies!

39:13.860 --> 39:15.730
Katherine was investigating the case.

39:15.780 --> 39:18.730
She was the person who linked it
to you. She had no reason to lie.

39:18.780 --> 39:21.410
She came after you and she's
lying half-dead in hospital!

39:21.460 --> 39:23.370
No, no! Joe, listen to me.

39:23.420 --> 39:26.250
Everything I have done,
I have done for you.

39:27.940 --> 39:29.730
I'm going to London to see Tim Fraser.

39:29.780 --> 39:31.890
He needs to know I'm his
son. I won't be back.

39:31.940 --> 39:36.250
No! Joe, no! No! Joe, please!
You don't... I can't lose you!

39:45.100 --> 39:46.900
(I love you.)

39:57.700 --> 39:59.500
- What's the matter?
- No, please.

40:07.460 --> 40:09.460
I'm pregnant.

40:13.060 --> 40:14.530
Get rid of it.

40:16.280 --> 40:17.250
Look what you made me do!

40:17.300 --> 40:19.690
- You said you didn't love him.
- I said lots of things.

40:19.740 --> 40:22.530
If you want the baby, that's
fine, but stay with me.

40:22.580 --> 40:25.610
Don't be stupid. I mean it,
Elizabeth. You've got to go.

40:25.660 --> 40:28.170
- You can't live a lie, Laura!
- You don't get it, do you?

40:28.220 --> 40:30.850
Everything we've done this
summer, it wasn't real.

40:30.900 --> 40:32.850
It was a game.

40:34.000 --> 40:34.890
A game?

40:34.940 --> 40:37.460
Tim's best friend, the jealous cop.

40:38.140 --> 40:41.100
Can I turn her? Make her mine?

40:41.660 --> 40:44.220
I made a bet with myself. I won.

40:45.500 --> 40:49.090
Please don't say that. Please
just take it back. Take it back.

40:49.140 --> 40:51.050
Why should I? You're fucking naive.

40:51.100 --> 40:54.530
- That's not true. - I'm having
this baby and I'm staying with Tim.

40:54.580 --> 40:57.770
I don't want you coming
anywhere near us, or our child.

40:57.820 --> 41:01.330
You do, I'll tell your copper
mates, "Liz Bancroft's a dyke.

41:01.380 --> 41:03.050
Liz Bancroft's a dyke."

41:03.100 --> 41:05.370
I am not. It was just you. I loved you!

41:05.420 --> 41:08.010
You come across as so on it,
but it's been easy to have you.

41:08.060 --> 41:11.210
You're pathetic. First
it was Tim, and now me.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.740
Well, neither of us want
you, OK? Leave us alone!

41:19.500 --> 41:21.100
No!

41:31.980 --> 41:32.940
No!

41:36.340 --> 41:38.410
No! No!

41:38.460 --> 41:40.370
Elizabeth! Elizabeth, please!

41:40.420 --> 41:42.020
Please, no!

42:17.540 --> 42:19.980
I got you a card with some daffodils on.

42:20.700 --> 42:22.700
Laura's favourite.

42:29.260 --> 42:31.060
Len Dorman?

42:32.140 --> 42:33.940
Elizabeth Bancroft.

42:36.620 --> 42:38.660
- You were on the investigation.
- Yes.

42:39.580 --> 42:41.180
The only copper that bothered.

42:43.140 --> 42:44.740
Apart from this one.

42:46.420 --> 42:48.540
Katherine's a fine police officer.

42:49.100 --> 42:51.940
I know she was sorry that she
couldn't solve Laura's case.

42:52.460 --> 42:55.620
She had a lead. She knows who did it.

42:56.940 --> 42:59.980
- Really? - We just have
to pray she gets better.

43:14.460 --> 43:41.460
[~]

43:47.020 --> 43:50.880
~

44:02.380 --> 44:04.820
Uncuff him and give me five
minutes will you, Andy?

44:24.220 --> 44:26.940
It's not been made public,
but I've been promoted.

44:27.900 --> 44:32.620
When the IPCC have cleared this, and I go back
to work, I'll be Detective Chief Superintendent.

44:33.260 --> 44:35.970
Congratulations. How does it feel?

44:36.020 --> 44:37.820
Good.

44:38.700 --> 44:40.700
How does it feel to be
head of your family?

44:41.300 --> 44:44.890
I should feel shit about it. I
told you where Athif was hiding.

44:44.940 --> 44:46.740
And that's our secret.

44:51.700 --> 44:54.570
So, you're up in court in two weeks.

44:54.620 --> 44:57.290
We'll make the judge aware
of your service to the police.

44:57.340 --> 44:59.570
You should be out in six months.

44:59.620 --> 45:01.810
And then Highwater's yours.

45:01.860 --> 45:03.460
I might want to expand.

45:06.660 --> 45:09.020
As long as we discuss it first.

45:12.940 --> 45:15.980
Any decisions have to
be mutually beneficial.
