WEBVTT

00:07.080 --> 00:09.880
Watch out, Newcastle, we are back!

00:09.960 --> 00:12.520
(all cheer)
We're gonna go fucking akka.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.160
It's time to smash Newcastle.

00:15.240 --> 00:16.280
On the pull!

00:16.360 --> 00:18.320
Things are gonna go pure radge!

00:20.040 --> 00:21.640
(screaming)
(Scotty T) What the fuck?

00:21.720 --> 00:24.720
No!
(indistinct shouting)

00:24.800 --> 00:27.600
This time, there's gonna be
more necking on...

00:29.000 --> 00:31.280
(cheering)
More kick-offs...

00:31.360 --> 00:33.440
(Chloe shouting)
More drama...

00:33.520 --> 00:35.640
(indistinct shouting)
SLAG!

00:35.720 --> 00:37.520
More tears, more tantrums,

00:37.600 --> 00:40.080
more loving, more shagging...
(moaning)

00:40.160 --> 00:41.800
...more drunkness...
Howay, Chloe, man!

00:41.880 --> 00:45.000
And more falling over!
Sounds fucking mint!

00:46.160 --> 00:48.200
Oh!
Watch out, Newcastle,

00:48.280 --> 00:51.120
cos the Geordie squad
are back in the fucking mix.

00:52.280 --> 00:55.600
Let's get this fucking party
started. Let the games begin.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.680
You are a fucking liar!

00:57.760 --> 00:59.360
Newcastle, oy-yoy!

01:00.400 --> 01:01.680
It's time to tear up the toon!

01:01.760 --> 01:03.800
(all exclaiming)

01:08.640 --> 01:10.120
I finished with Mitch.
No.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.200
Oh, shit.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.320
Scott's the one
who will fuck you over.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.320
Howay!
That's why I'm in love with him.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.320
Don't worry, Chloe,
I won't go near Scott.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.320
What the fuck is Chantelle's game?

01:27.400 --> 01:30.160
'I'm glad that she picked Scott
cos she's a fucking nightmare.'

01:30.240 --> 01:33.840
'This girl is pure class.'
(heavy breathing, Chantelle moans)

01:34.720 --> 01:37.320
If this is him making an effort,
he might as well not bother.

01:41.920 --> 01:44.440
Chantelle's necking on,
but I am not arsed, at all.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.200
I'm still gutted over Scott.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.920
All the girls have been great,
they've all got me back.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
(Scott) You miss me chopper?

01:51.080 --> 01:53.720
Sorry, Chantelle,
I did tell you Scott was mine.

01:55.160 --> 01:57.000
The only dick I like sucking
is Scott's.

01:57.080 --> 02:00.320
When this bomb gets dropped,
no one is gonna wanna be around.

02:01.840 --> 02:04.080
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.080
I would never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.520
Get me in this house
cos I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.880
I'm radge, and I've wrapped the lads
around me little finger.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.920
I'm preened to perfection.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.840
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:14.920 --> 02:17.080
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.800
I'm fit, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

02:19.880 --> 02:22.040
(all) Geordie Shore, wae'aye!

02:37.040 --> 02:40.080
Oh, my God!
I woke up this morning,

02:40.160 --> 02:42.680
and I cannot believe
what I did last night.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.120
And I need to tell Charlotte
exactly what's happened.

02:46.560 --> 02:50.200
Me and Chloe go down to the Shag Pad
and she is looking stressed.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.200
What?

02:59.080 --> 03:02.200
WHOA, my God!

03:02.280 --> 03:03.360
WHAT?

03:07.440 --> 03:08.600
Chantelle was crying last night,

03:08.680 --> 03:12.040
but I've only got one thing
on my mind. Scott.

03:12.120 --> 03:14.680
I like him so much,
and there's something between wuh.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.160
This is only gonna end badly.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.200
I feel like I've been chewing boots.

03:26.720 --> 03:29.880
Look at the mirror. 'Last night,
Chantelle was out of control.'

03:29.960 --> 03:31.840
I don't know what's going on
with her and Scott,

03:31.920 --> 03:33.680
but coming home
and smashing things up

03:33.760 --> 03:35.480
certainly won't solve her problems.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.080
I literally just had a flashback.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.800
Wait till I tell you
what else happened,

03:38.880 --> 03:41.400
cos I've got a feeling things
are about to get much worse.

03:41.480 --> 03:44.080
While Chantelle
was downstairs crying,

03:44.160 --> 03:47.040
he was upstairs
getting his dick sucked by Chloe.

03:47.120 --> 03:51.000
(laughs)
No? No fucking way.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.640
Oh, my God!

03:52.720 --> 03:54.680
She is gonna fucking flip.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.840
You just woke up the sleeping dead,
mate.

03:56.920 --> 04:00.600
Howay, lads. Chantelle was necking
on with some fucking radgie,

04:00.680 --> 04:02.360
so what the fuck is the problem?

04:02.440 --> 04:05.200
There isn't a chance of her finding
out unless Chloe says something.

04:05.280 --> 04:08.240
In this house, there is no secrets,
mate. Everyone finds out everything.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.960
Oh, my God. This is gonna get
so interesting.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.720
(Chloe) How are youse?

04:17.800 --> 04:20.400
All right.
Me eyes are a bit swollen and puffy.

04:20.480 --> 04:23.760
Last night was fucking horrible.
I pulled a lad in the club.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.480
And, to be honest,
it was only to get back Scott.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.640
But, I think it's backfired
and now we're done.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.680
I'm hurt, I'm not even gonna lie,

04:30.760 --> 04:35.000
cos I'm gonna start off
crying again. Just...

04:35.080 --> 04:37.960
Just... (cries)
It's all right, don't cry.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.200
Obviously, I still like Scott.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.200
and I'm just gutted
how it's all turned out.

04:42.280 --> 04:44.920
I don't want to babble on again,
but...

04:46.440 --> 04:48.000
The best thing
that's come out of this,

04:48.080 --> 04:50.320
it's brought me and the girls
closer together.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.440
I didn't see that you were upset.
I don't know where the hell I was.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.920
(phone ringing)

05:05.000 --> 05:06.280
(Holly) Phone!

05:06.360 --> 05:09.360
The phone's ringing, and it's only
ever gonna be the PPI man,

05:09.440 --> 05:10.560
or that bitch, Anna.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.320
Hello.
(Anna) 'Hi, Holly.'

05:12.400 --> 05:13.560
Hello, you all right?

05:13.640 --> 05:15.960
I heard you went away
for a few days. What happened.

05:16.040 --> 05:19.000
Me and Charlotte fell out. Being in
the house it was gonna end up

05:19.080 --> 05:21.360
that me and her were gonna probably
end up having a fist fight.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.040
If it was anybody else,
but Charlotte,

05:23.120 --> 05:24.840
I don't think I'd have came back
to this house.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.760
She is my best friend and I'm glad
that we've sorted things out.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.520
But there's, obviously,
a lot of work to do, still.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.480
'Well, I'm glad you've made up now.'

05:31.560 --> 05:34.800
Listen, I've got a treat
for you all. Right.

05:34.880 --> 05:38.440
I'm sending you all
for a night away in Hull. Right.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.840
'Hull? Is this a fucking joke?'
Fuck off, Anna.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.800
'I've put you up
somewhere very special,

05:43.880 --> 05:45.800
'and you're gonna be travelling
in style.'

05:45.880 --> 05:48.520
That's gotta be a lie.
She never sends us anywhere nice.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.200
What the fuck? What's happening?
So, Anna's been on the phone.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.840
She's putting us up
somewhere very special.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.160
In Hull.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.440
YES!

05:56.520 --> 05:58.560
Hull? Whooo-hoo!

05:58.640 --> 06:00.200
I love Hull.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.440
I don't know why Charlotte's
getting so excited about Hull,

06:02.520 --> 06:03.840
it's a pure shithole.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.560
Hull, Hull, Hull...

06:05.640 --> 06:09.920
Hull, Hull, Hull, Hull, Hull, Hull,
Hull, Hull, Hull, Hull, Hull, WHOOO!

06:10.000 --> 06:12.320
It's fucking shit.
(girls) Hull, Hull, Hull...

06:16.480 --> 06:18.280
We're all packed
and ready to go to Hull.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.880
It's time to go outside and find out

06:19.960 --> 06:21.680
what Anna thinks
"travelling in style" is.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.960
Knowing her,
it'll be a fucking donkey.

06:26.760 --> 06:28.880
(girls scream)

06:31.200 --> 06:32.400
(girls scream)
(Nathan) YES!

06:32.480 --> 06:34.920
Oh, my God!
Anna's done us proud.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Anna said we were gonna be
travelling in style

06:37.080 --> 06:39.240
and, fuck me,
she's actually stuck to her word.

06:39.320 --> 06:40.400
We've got a limo!

06:40.480 --> 06:41.760
(girls exclaiming indistinctly)

06:41.840 --> 06:43.280
I sat in the back of the limo,

06:43.360 --> 06:46.840
and guess who the hell
sits next to me. Chantelle.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.640
(indistinct shouting)

06:51.720 --> 06:52.960
Are you taking the piss?

06:53.040 --> 06:55.400
I'm trapped in a space
with two bunny boilers.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.480
This is gonna be awkward.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.600
Unless they both decide to get naked
and fucking suck us off.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.560
D-D-D-D-D! Double dish.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.400
(cork popping and cheering)

07:04.480 --> 07:05.560
(Nathan) Yeah-he!

07:05.640 --> 07:07.640
Let's get pissed!

07:07.720 --> 07:09.920
(chants) Drink it,
drink it, drink it...

07:10.000 --> 07:11.640
(cheering)

07:11.720 --> 07:14.120
I'm having a proper laugh with Chloe
in the limo.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.200
(repeats) On the pull in Hull...
On the pull...

07:17.280 --> 07:19.000
This trip is gonna be a belter.

07:28.400 --> 07:32.080
We've been driving for hours
and we pull into a country lane.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.120
This doesn't look like Hull.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.680
(Aaron) Pitch black. Wherever we
are going we've got no lights.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.520
OH, MY GOD!

07:40.320 --> 07:44.200
We're staying in pods. I'm not gonna
lie, they look fucking wicked.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.080
(excited screaming)

07:46.160 --> 07:47.680
(Chloe laughing) Oh!

07:47.760 --> 07:49.000
These pods are unreal.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.280
I'm gonna bagsy meself the best one.

07:51.360 --> 07:54.240
This is wicked.
Oh, my God. Here's Chantelle.

07:54.320 --> 07:56.680
And I think she wants to share pods.

07:56.760 --> 07:59.080
Fuck! Shit! Awkward.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.840
We need to push our beds together.
Definitely.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.040
Yeah ! Yeah,
let's push the beds together (!)

08:04.120 --> 08:05.760
So you can kill us in me sleep.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.280
Oh, really?

08:10.360 --> 08:13.000
I'm buzzing
to be sharing a pod with Chloe.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.400
Lately, me and her
have got really close.

08:15.480 --> 08:18.280
Thanks to her, I'm finally starting
to feel like I'm fitting in.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.960
Seal with...
Oh, thank you.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.480
OH, GOD!

08:22.560 --> 08:23.800
Fuck's sake.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.640
Even though me and Charlotte's
friendship isn't at its best,

08:28.720 --> 08:31.600
I would much rather that, than be
sharing with Chantelle or Chloe now.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.880
I've decided,
I'm gonna tell Chantelle tonight.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.240
Shit. What are you going to say?

08:35.320 --> 08:37.720
I don't know why I've gotta tell
her. I'm sharing a room with her.

08:37.800 --> 08:40.560
I'm not gonna lie, I'm quite excited
to watch when you're telling her.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.400
(laughs) That's so evil.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.520
I can't control me feelings
over Scott.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.240
After last night,
it could be back on,

08:46.320 --> 08:47.920
so I need to tell Chantelle
the truth.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.840
There is gonna be arguments tonight.
It is. No matter what anyone says,

08:54.920 --> 08:56.120
there is gonna be arguments.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.880
Hold on a minute, Gaz,
there's only gonna be an argument

08:58.960 --> 09:00.720
if Chloe tells Chantelle
what happened.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.960
And she's not gonna do that
cos it was her own fucking fault.

09:04.040 --> 09:07.240
She's walked into my room,
purposely, to crack on with me.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.200
I didn't go and speak to her,
she came to me.

09:09.280 --> 09:12.800
Scott, you are fucked.
Oh, well, let's get to Hull.

09:16.680 --> 09:19.320
(Charlotte) We've rocked up
in the limo, feeling fresh.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.480
Hull, you are about to get smashed.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.040
(cheering)

09:24.000 --> 09:25.920
(all) Wae'aye!

09:29.320 --> 09:31.200
I've got Chloe on one side
of the club

09:31.280 --> 09:32.480
and Chantelle on the other side.

09:32.560 --> 09:34.880
Which is exactly how
I fucking like it.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.800
Time to graft Chantelle and get
meself back in the good books.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.400
After making a fool of meself
last night,

09:43.480 --> 09:44.840
I thought me and Scott were over.

09:44.920 --> 09:47.840
But he comes over
and he's being really nice.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.360
What's going on? Shit.
Maybe there's still a chance.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.080
I can't believe
Scott is grafting Chantelle

10:02.160 --> 10:03.360
after what happened last night.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.760
(speaking indistinctly)

10:08.400 --> 10:10.720
I sucked his cock. Does that mean
nothing to you, Scott?

10:14.960 --> 10:17.720
Fuck! Chloe's gone over
to speak to Chantelle.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.240
I hope you've got your armour on.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.040
Chantelle, come here, please.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.880
I'm sweating, I'm cold,

10:22.960 --> 10:25.920
I'm shaking, I'm hot,
but I need to do this.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.560
I need to tell Chantelle
exactly what happened.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.920
Here we go. Chloe
has sat down with Chantelle

10:38.000 --> 10:40.560
and I am shitting meself.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.920
Chloe comes over to talk with us,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.080
and she looks proper nervous.

10:57.520 --> 11:01.440
Oh, fuck. It's starting.
Scott...run.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.840
Yet again, I've been grafting
Chantelle all night,

11:08.920 --> 11:10.680
and Chloe
is about to ruin everything.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.960
Just because she
can't keep her dirty mouth

11:13.040 --> 11:16.360
away from my wicked chopper,
I am fucked!

11:30.520 --> 11:32.000
You did what?

11:40.600 --> 11:45.240
This is horrible, this is possibly
the worst thing I've done in me life

11:45.320 --> 11:47.160
and I feel so shit about it.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.080
(sniffles) I'm definitely
more hurt than angry.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.800
Definitely. (sniffles)

12:09.800 --> 12:12.160
Me and Chloe have got a good bond
and I would have never,

12:12.240 --> 12:16.040
in a million years,
hurt a girl like that. Ever.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.400
Never.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.960
One minute, Chantelle's in tears,
and now, she's fucking raging.

12:34.360 --> 12:35.960
I'm foaming with Chloe,

12:36.040 --> 12:38.280
but let's not forget
the other fucking snakes here.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.320
Chantelle's up. Where's she going?

12:44.400 --> 12:47.440
Come this...
You can go and...fuck yourself!

12:48.480 --> 12:50.400
Fuck you!

12:50.480 --> 12:55.160
Oh! To throw a drink in Scott's face.
Unlucky, Scott!

12:59.680 --> 13:03.200
Round two. Chantelle runs to
the ropes, tags Chloe, "You're in".

13:07.400 --> 13:09.440
I understand why Chantelle's
kicking off, reet?

13:09.520 --> 13:11.280
But I didn't know why
Chloe's getting involved.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.440
She's the one
who put my chopper in her mouth.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.000
Fuck off, you radgie!

13:15.080 --> 13:16.560
(Nathan) Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:16.640 --> 13:18.360
You don't let someone
suck your cock,

13:18.440 --> 13:20.960
after knowing how much
they like you, you fucking prick.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.840
I'm taking you home.
Why?Home.

13:23.920 --> 13:27.160
Chloe hasn't got Marnie anymore,
so I've got to step up.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.040
Come on. It's time to go home.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.560
Nathan takes the little slut home,
and I'm buzzing,

13:32.640 --> 13:35.920
because if he didn't take her home,
I would have ragged her out meself.

13:38.840 --> 13:41.120
Scotty's being slugged
in every fucking angle.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.040
Man should have wore his cocoon
to the club.

13:45.880 --> 13:49.000
Well, all this arguing doesn't seem
to have affected Gary and Charlotte.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.440
They're having a brilliant time.

13:59.640 --> 14:02.880
I'm so glad that me and Gary
have passed that awful stage

14:02.960 --> 14:04.680
that Chloe and Scott
are in right now.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.760
We get on, now, better than ever,

14:06.840 --> 14:08.760
and I wouldn't change it
for the world.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.520
(Aaron) Tonight has been
absolutely shit.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.360
How am I supposed to pull any bird,

14:13.440 --> 14:15.440
when all the kick-offs
are happening around us?

14:15.520 --> 14:17.040
Let's get back to them fucking pods.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.040
There is not a chance in hell

14:23.120 --> 14:25.280
Chantelle and Chloe
can stay in the same pod tonight,

14:25.360 --> 14:28.520
so we need to work out
some new sleeping arrangements.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.040
(Chloe) Oh. I hate him!

14:31.120 --> 14:33.480
I know he's a dickhead,
and I know he's a prick,

14:33.560 --> 14:35.400
but I can't help
how I feel about him.

14:35.480 --> 14:36.960
Keep going, keep going.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.440
Nathan is looking after Chloe,

14:38.520 --> 14:41.080
and I feel as though somebody really
needs to look after Chantelle.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.360
Hull was absolutely shit.

14:47.440 --> 14:49.560
I'm soaking wet through,
and, to top it off,

14:49.640 --> 14:52.680
I'm sleeping in a fucking shed.
Great (!)

14:52.760 --> 14:56.800
I feel like I've been dragged
through a fucking wicker basket.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.040
(Charlotte) Which bed?

15:01.120 --> 15:03.800
Well, tonight's been
quite a crazy night,

15:03.880 --> 15:06.840
but it hasn't ended too badly for me!

15:06.920 --> 15:08.280
Welcome!

15:08.360 --> 15:11.360
I've just landed meself
in the same pod as Gary!

15:11.440 --> 15:12.640
YES! Yes, yes yes!

15:14.280 --> 15:15.520
Gary?

15:15.600 --> 15:18.840
Do you not feel a little bit like
we're in the rabbit hutch?

15:18.920 --> 15:21.920
(chuckles)
We are actual Charlotte and Gary.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.520
(bird song)

15:28.600 --> 15:30.120
(snoring)

15:30.200 --> 15:32.120
(yawns)

15:36.320 --> 15:38.640
I was actually quite pleased
it all kicked off.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.880
I think we needed some quality time,
did you not?(laughs)

15:41.960 --> 15:44.240
I've woke up next to Charlotte,
and we're in a very good place.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.440
What's happened?

15:46.520 --> 15:48.800
Do you want to hold hands?
(laughing) No.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.240
Oh, God.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.920
Me and you.
Two rabbits in a hutch, 'ey?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.080
I do not want to leave
this little pod,

15:55.160 --> 15:59.040
cos, out there, it's gonna be
the most awkward morning ever.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.680
How are you feeling this morning?

16:02.760 --> 16:05.800
(exhales) I'm still angry. Upset.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.800
It's fucking freezing,
and I'm sharing a pod with Chloe.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.000
Not only that,
I had to come home early last night,

16:11.080 --> 16:12.200
because she kicked off.

16:12.280 --> 16:14.680
I think, the main important thing is

16:14.760 --> 16:17.400
speaking to Chantelle, and
building that friendship back up.

16:17.480 --> 16:20.360
Because, right now, she's gonna
feel down, she's gonna feel kicked

16:20.440 --> 16:23.640
cos she's just lost you
and she's lost Scott.Mmm.

16:26.960 --> 16:29.280
Fucking hell.
How mental was last night?

16:29.360 --> 16:32.160
I've woke up
and I feel like absolute shit.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.520
I thought that me and Chloe
were getting quite close.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.880
I just feel hurt at what she's done.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.760
I do feel really sorry
for Chantelle,

16:38.840 --> 16:40.600
I know what it's like
to be the new girl,

16:40.680 --> 16:42.120
so I really wanna be there for her.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.600
So, what do you think
you're gonna do today?

16:44.680 --> 16:47.440
Are you going to speak to Chloe or
are you gonna stay out of her way?

16:47.520 --> 16:48.520
I don't wanna speak with her.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.600
I loved the girl to bits
and I thought she was my friend.

16:50.680 --> 16:53.960
Right now, I think she's a slag.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.320
I'll have the last laugh, though.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.440
I will have the last laugh.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.080
Chloe is gonna regret
fucking with me.

16:59.160 --> 17:02.880
Mark my word,
this girl always comes out on top.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.360
She didn't have to go on like that.
Why-why-why...?

17:09.440 --> 17:12.280
Why was she going on
like, fucking, a psychopath?

17:12.360 --> 17:15.800
Chantelle is probably never gonna
speak to us again. Gutter!

17:15.880 --> 17:19.240
She didn't have to tell Chantelle,
she could have kept it a secret.

17:19.320 --> 17:22.480
I think you might be public enemy
number one, today, like. (laughs)

17:22.560 --> 17:24.640
But, mate, you're missing
the key thing.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.680
I'm still fucking number one.

17:26.760 --> 17:30.360
Fuck it.
This shit fucking sucks, mate.

17:33.440 --> 17:35.160
Things are so awkward this morning,

17:35.240 --> 17:37.200
I just can't wait
to get back to Newcastle.

17:37.280 --> 17:41.360
The problem is, we all have to be
cramped in a limo together for
hours.

17:44.440 --> 17:46.280
(Charlotte) To Hull was so much fun,

17:46.360 --> 17:49.600
but the journey back
is more like a funeral car.

17:49.680 --> 17:52.680
I just wanna get back to Newcastle,
and get out of this limo.

17:54.080 --> 17:57.080
Get back to the house,
everyone's feeling shit and awkward,

17:57.160 --> 17:58.880
God knows
what tonight's gonna be like.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.400
Back fucking home!

18:01.480 --> 18:03.120
I've never felt this shit
in all me life.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.840
I cannot imagine
anything fixing this, like.

18:05.920 --> 18:07.880
Nay pissing about,
get fucking ready.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.280
Hi!

18:10.360 --> 18:12.520
(girls scream)

18:12.600 --> 18:13.920
(screams)

18:14.000 --> 18:15.400
(all scream)

18:15.480 --> 18:17.560
Surprise. I'm back.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.640
(screaming continues)

18:21.160 --> 18:23.240
Yaaaay! YES!

18:23.320 --> 18:25.880
(laughing and screaming)

18:25.960 --> 18:29.560
Oh, my fucking God!
Marnie's back!

18:29.640 --> 18:31.520
(girls screaming)

18:31.600 --> 18:33.920
YES!
I am fucking buzzin'.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.800
I'm shaking.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.640
The last time I seen these lot
was in Greece,

18:37.720 --> 18:40.000
and I got engaged.
But that didn't work out.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.320
So, the engagement is off,
and I'm single.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.120
Listen, youse.

18:44.200 --> 18:47.560
I'm single now.
(all cheer)

18:47.640 --> 18:49.840
Only in the Geordie Shore house
would you get a cheer

18:49.920 --> 18:51.840
for announcing
that your engagement is off.

18:51.920 --> 18:53.320
What the fuck?

18:53.400 --> 18:56.480
That's really embarrassing,
but, like, it didn't work out.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.160
Me and Marnie
have always had chemistry

18:58.240 --> 18:59.600
but it just never really worked.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.480
When she got engaged,
I thought that was it.

19:01.560 --> 19:04.840
Oh, well.Never mind.
Never mind.You're back now.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.600
But now she's back,
and she's single,

19:06.680 --> 19:08.400
I am fucking buzzing.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.960
Tell us what's been going on.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.080
Oh.
Oh.

19:11.160 --> 19:12.680
(Scotty T) Everything.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.120
So, is anybody gonna introduce us?

19:15.200 --> 19:16.440
I am here, you know?

19:16.520 --> 19:18.440
Marnie. Marnie.
You haven't met Chantelle.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.280
Chantelle, Marnie,
Marnie, Chantelle.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.560
You all right?
Yeah.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.640
It was very awkward
meeting this new girl.

19:23.720 --> 19:26.000
She's got long dark hair,
big brown eyes.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.800
Who's she trying to be? Me?

19:27.880 --> 19:31.760
So, tell us what else is going on?
Come on. I need more info.

19:31.840 --> 19:35.160
Who's gonna be the first person to
tell Marnie that Aaron

19:35.240 --> 19:38.120
has got Chantelle's name
tattooed on his wrist? Hmm?

19:38.200 --> 19:39.760
Aaron got a tattoo.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.800
Shock! It's Scott.
You cock-blocking little bastard.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.640
What tattoo?
(awkward laughter)

19:45.720 --> 19:47.720
Maybe I shouldn't have
mentioned anything,

19:47.800 --> 19:50.080
but soz, Aaron,
survival of the fittest, kid.

19:50.160 --> 19:53.080
He got my name.
What the fuck?

19:53.160 --> 19:54.600
Why would you do that?

19:54.680 --> 19:57.520
I tell you why I don't it.
because you were engaged

19:57.600 --> 20:00.120
and I wanted to pull Chantelle,
and get one over on Scott.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.520
But, fucking hell,
I regret getting it now, like.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.040
You never got my name
tattooed on ya.

20:04.120 --> 20:07.000
There's obviously history
between Aaron and Marnie,

20:07.080 --> 20:09.600
this is gonna be awkward.
Here we gan.

20:09.680 --> 20:12.160
(Charlotte) Howay! Howay, let's go.
Let's get ready.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.480
(cheering and screaming)

20:13.560 --> 20:16.840
Let's not waste anymore time,
let's get ready, then get drunk,

20:16.920 --> 20:18.640
then go out. Come on!

20:27.120 --> 20:29.800
I am so excited that you're here.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.560
I can't get over the reaction,
I'm so happy about it.

20:32.640 --> 20:35.880
I can't believe me best friend,
Marnie, is back.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.240
A lot has gone on.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.000
I can't believe
that Chantelle had the cheek

20:47.080 --> 20:49.320
to go near Scott
when Chloe was there first.

20:49.400 --> 20:53.000
When I left, it was you and Scott.
Youse were a thing.Yeah.

21:01.080 --> 21:04.040
I've told Marnie everything
about Chantelle,

21:04.120 --> 21:06.800
and she's totally on my side.
That's exactly what I needed.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.600
This is what happened,
this is the bad one, right?

21:08.680 --> 21:10.360
Me and Scott were mortal upstairs,
right?

21:10.440 --> 21:13.360
And we were having a flirt on,
and then he got his dick out.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.320
So, last night, I felt really bad,
I felt so bad.

21:16.400 --> 21:20.280
Why the fuck should you feel bad
when she has blatantly got with him

21:20.360 --> 21:22.480
knowing fine well
that you have a thing for him.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.960
At the end of the day,
Scott was mine first.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.960
I wish I didn't have feelings,
but I do.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.040
Oh. I'm so happy you're here.

21:29.120 --> 21:31.120
You've actually made my life!
Have I?

21:31.200 --> 21:32.920
Like, you've made
all me problems go away.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.400
You are actually me best friend
in the whole world.

21:35.480 --> 21:37.920
Chantelle may be pissed off
about me and Scott,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.200
but let's not forget,
she did it to me first,

21:40.280 --> 21:43.280
and I forgave her,
so let's hope she can forgive me.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.680
Marnie's back. I need to make sure
I look fucking fit tonight.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.520
Are you happy? Extremely happy?

21:50.600 --> 21:52.440
Look at this face.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.960
Aaron, play it cool. Play it cool.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.040
Up until now, I've been top shagger,

21:56.120 --> 21:59.000
but now Marnie's here,
everything is gonna fucking change.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.080
I won't even look at another girl.

22:01.160 --> 22:03.240
Howay. Let's go.
(whistling)

22:03.320 --> 22:05.480
Let's get berserk.

22:07.480 --> 22:08.840
Here come the girls!

22:08.920 --> 22:12.040
It's weird seeing five girls
coming down the stairs.Oh, no!

22:12.120 --> 22:15.480
All the girls come down the stairs
but I'm only looking at Marnie.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.040
She looks fit as fuck!

22:17.120 --> 22:19.880
Let's put all differences aside
just for fucking one night.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.040
(Charlotte and Holly) Yes!

22:21.120 --> 22:23.160
Let's stop wasting time,
down your shot, and let's go.

22:23.240 --> 22:27.080
The only time we're getting wet
tonight, is in the hot tub!

22:27.160 --> 22:29.120
(all cheer)

22:34.240 --> 22:37.400
Marnie's back.
The table is full of drink,

22:37.480 --> 22:41.160
and everyone just wants to have
a laugh. Wicked!

22:41.240 --> 22:42.840
(dance music)

22:44.000 --> 22:45.680
To Marnie's first night back!

22:45.760 --> 22:48.200
(all cheer)

22:51.240 --> 22:53.560
Everyone's in a mint mood,
we're all getting drunk.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.600
Everyone's so happy that I'm back.

22:56.920 --> 22:59.880
I constantly have to watch
what shit these lot get up to

22:59.960 --> 23:02.720
so it's up to me to inform Marnie
on what's been going on.

23:06.640 --> 23:09.000
I can't believe
that Holly is back with Kyle.

23:09.080 --> 23:11.120
after everything that
he put her through in Greece.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.400
She is a mug.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.680
Oh, man.

23:19.760 --> 23:21.560
You've missed so much.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.120
What the hell? Charlotte and Gary?

23:28.200 --> 23:30.480
What else has been happening
while I've been gone?

23:34.120 --> 23:35.920
I think everyone's forgetting

23:36.000 --> 23:39.560
that me and Gary have been good
friends now for over a year,

23:39.640 --> 23:43.200
and nothing's gonna happen.
Calm down, guys.

23:51.240 --> 23:53.240
Marnie and Aaron
have history together.

23:53.320 --> 23:54.760
They were off, then they were on,

23:54.840 --> 23:55.880
then they were off again,

23:55.960 --> 23:58.320
but they were never fully on.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.480
This could be the time
they are fully on.

24:05.560 --> 24:07.600
I'm dancing.
I'm doing some radge moves.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.840
And what can be better?
I've got me best there with us.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.840
I'm so happy to be back
with this crazy bunch.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.000
Me and Aaron are flirting,

24:17.080 --> 24:19.160
and even Gary and Charlotte
seem to be flirting.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.600
Some things never change.

24:20.680 --> 24:21.760
Apart from the new girl.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.160
But no one really cares about her.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.920
Since falling out
with Chloe and Scott,

24:26.000 --> 24:27.640
it's been proper shit in the house.

24:27.720 --> 24:29.120
And now that Marnie's back,

24:29.200 --> 24:30.840
I feel completely
pushed to the side.

24:35.560 --> 24:36.920
Marnie can't help but flirt.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.120
She's single, I'm single,
and it just feels right.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.160
I can see why Marnie
is angry about the tattoo.

24:52.240 --> 24:55.240
If she got the name of one of the
lads in this house tattooed on her,

24:55.320 --> 24:57.040
I'd be fucking raging.

25:03.200 --> 25:06.000
(chanting) Kiss her!
Kiss her! Kiss her!

25:06.080 --> 25:08.240
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!

25:08.320 --> 25:12.480
# Kiss her, kiss her
I know you've really missed her

25:12.560 --> 25:16.680
# Feel her, finger her
I know you wanna hear her pussy purr

25:16.760 --> 25:18.120
# Meow #

25:18.200 --> 25:21.280
(all chant) Kiss her!
Kiss her! Kiss her!

25:21.360 --> 25:22.760
(laughing)

25:26.000 --> 25:28.760
Me first night back
has been fucking amazing.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.440
It's time to get back to the house.

25:30.520 --> 25:32.720
Let's go, let's go!
(indistinct chattering)

25:34.720 --> 25:36.320
Buzzing!

25:39.200 --> 25:41.560
(speaking indistinctly)

25:43.640 --> 25:45.840
We're back at the house
and everyone's mortal.

25:45.920 --> 25:48.520
HOT TUB!(Holly) HOT TUB!
HOT TUB!

25:48.600 --> 25:51.280
So, to the hot tub! And beyond.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.640
Yeah.
Argh!

25:56.720 --> 25:58.240
Gary, I knew you were gonna do that!

25:58.320 --> 26:00.200
Everyone's in the hot tub,
having a wicked time.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.160
(laughing)

26:02.240 --> 26:05.440
But where's Scott?
He's been acting weird all night.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.320
There's no way I'm getting in that
Jacuzzi with Chantelle and Chloe.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.640
I might as well run a bath and
fucking hoy some sea urchins in it.

26:11.720 --> 26:13.920
Is that your willy?
Let's continue the party inside.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.760
(Holly) Yeah!

26:15.840 --> 26:19.160
We're all mortal, so what's
the one thing we need right now?

26:19.240 --> 26:20.840
Food. And lots of it.

26:22.320 --> 26:26.080
Oh, what's that?
Lasagne. Yeah, let it warm up.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.680
I walk in the kitchen.
Nathan's cooking.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.040
And then I see some chilli flakes.

26:30.120 --> 26:32.640
I cannot resist.

26:32.720 --> 26:36.320
It's hot. I like it.
(Charlotte speaking indistinctly)

26:36.400 --> 26:38.640
(coughing)

26:38.720 --> 26:40.800
It was a hot one.

26:40.880 --> 26:44.000
(coughing)
Hot, this. A bit hot.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.680
It wants to be, mate, it has a whole
tub of fucking chilli flakes in.

26:46.760 --> 26:49.920
My throat is on fire.
(laughing)

26:50.000 --> 26:51.040
Now it's getting hot.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.280
Like really fucking hot.

26:53.360 --> 26:56.120
(grunting)
(screaming)

26:57.520 --> 26:59.760
Nathan's being sick
all over himself.

26:59.840 --> 27:00.920
What a mug!

27:01.000 --> 27:03.240
(all exclaiming)

27:04.240 --> 27:06.160
Nathan's threw up,
everyone's laughing,

27:06.240 --> 27:09.200
he's now trying to kick his sick
at everyone, this is a mess.

27:09.280 --> 27:11.720
Oi!
(indistinct shouting)

27:11.800 --> 27:15.320
Tonight has been so messy, to say
the least, but it's been amazing.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.400
Nathan, make sure
you clean your sick up.

27:19.040 --> 27:22.280
I've had a wicked night,
and I've ended up in Aaron's bed.

27:22.360 --> 27:24.920
I know it's quick,
but it just feels right

27:28.720 --> 27:31.480
Everyone's gone to bed
and left me to clean up my sick.

27:31.560 --> 27:34.400
Fuck this shit. I'm declaring war

27:34.480 --> 27:37.360
on every single one of
you little bitches in this house.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.320
You're all fucked now!

27:56.640 --> 27:58.520
Morning, campers!

27:58.600 --> 28:02.080
(laughing)
I am buzzin' that you're back.

28:02.160 --> 28:03.960
It's me first morning back
in the house,

28:04.040 --> 28:05.840
and even though me and Aaron
had a cuddle last night,

28:05.920 --> 28:07.600
I want to wake up with me girls.

28:07.680 --> 28:10.160
Last night was a fun night.
(Holly) Yeah.

28:10.240 --> 28:13.160
Girls, did any kick-offs happen
last night?

28:13.240 --> 28:17.160
No. Get in!
That's what I'm talking about!

28:17.240 --> 28:18.880
Ugh! Ugh! UGH!

28:18.960 --> 28:21.760
It was just pure fun.

28:21.840 --> 28:25.160
All the girls are talking about
what a great night last night was.

28:25.240 --> 28:27.840
Am I missing something here?
Cos now Marnie's back,

28:27.920 --> 28:30.480
I'm starting to feel
really left out. I feel like shit.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.240
I was keeping a watchful eye
over you and Aaron,

28:33.320 --> 28:35.920
but I can't remember
seeing a kiss with tongues.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.640
There was a kiss with tongues.
(gasping)

28:37.720 --> 28:40.960
When?
(stammers) Just in that bed.

28:41.040 --> 28:43.240
Oh, the world is good.

28:49.080 --> 28:50.600
It was good.

28:50.680 --> 28:53.280
I've woken up
and all I can taste is sick.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.640
But at least Aaron's woke up
with a smile on his face.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.560
I think it's quite cute how you both
get nervous around each other.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.960
Haven't seen her for ages, have I?

29:01.040 --> 29:04.120
Nathan's banging on about how cute
me and Marnie were last night

29:04.200 --> 29:07.720
and he has got a point, me legs
were shaking when I first saw her.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.360
Didn't do anything. We just kissed.

29:09.440 --> 29:12.920
No, you had cuddlesies all night.
You were like that. Eee!

29:13.000 --> 29:15.600
But you weren't even here.
You weren't in the hot tub.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.160
In the kitchen, you weren't there.

29:17.240 --> 29:18.800
Scott done the right thing last night

29:18.880 --> 29:20.800
by staying away
from Chloe and Chantelle.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.680
To be honest, I forgot all about it.

29:22.760 --> 29:25.600
In fact, I forgot about Chantelle
altogether.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.160
Chantelle was like the new toy.

29:27.240 --> 29:29.400
Like, she come in,
Scott was chasing over her,

29:30.480 --> 29:32.160
I was chasing over her...

29:32.240 --> 29:34.560
And now, Marnie's back...
Now Marnie's back, oh...

29:34.640 --> 29:36.440
Everyone's like, "Chantelle, what?"

29:36.520 --> 29:37.600
She's like the old toy.

29:37.680 --> 29:39.240
An old toy? The funny thing is,

29:39.320 --> 29:41.320
I didn't even get to fucking play
with the old toy.

29:46.440 --> 29:49.800
It feels like I've never been away.
Waking up and being able to hang out

29:49.880 --> 29:52.480
with me best friend, Chloe,
it feels amazing.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.240
I haven't even seen
the new Shag Pad.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.040
Has anyone shagged in it yet?

29:56.120 --> 29:57.240
Mm-hm.
Who?

29:57.320 --> 29:59.440
Oh.
Awks.

29:59.520 --> 30:00.560
Aaron.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.680
Aaron? What the fuck?

30:02.760 --> 30:04.040
Er... Yeah.

30:04.120 --> 30:06.760
He has, he has...shagged.

30:06.840 --> 30:09.120
He would never do that
if you were here.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.920
He didn't even look at
another girl last night.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.440
That doesn't make us
feel any better.

30:12.520 --> 30:15.520
I don't know what I expect
from Aaron cos I was engaged,

30:15.600 --> 30:18.920
but as long as I don't meet the girl,
I'll not kill him.

30:23.880 --> 30:26.920
I thought I told Marnie everything
last night,

30:27.000 --> 30:31.120
but how could I forget
Gary and Charlotte the rabbits?

30:31.200 --> 30:32.640
Here they are.
Oh, my God.

30:32.720 --> 30:34.920
Oh, actually Gary looks quite cute.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.480
I hope Marnie likes rabbits,
cos no one else in the house does,

30:38.560 --> 30:42.040
and it's hard just me
caring for these two rabbits

30:42.120 --> 30:43.240
like a single mother.

30:43.320 --> 30:46.160
I saw this trick, before,
that you can do with rabbits.

30:46.240 --> 30:49.720
I've got to bang me legs off the
floor, and he's gonna jump around.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.440
Everybody loves tricks.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.520
Come on, Gary, you can do it.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.200
Gary?

30:57.120 --> 30:58.440
(banging feet on floor, sighs)

30:58.520 --> 31:01.720
Charlotte's trying to learn these
rabbits tricks but they're so shit,

31:01.800 --> 31:04.240
these couldn't even walk
into a magic hat if they tried.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.120
What's happening? Is he coming near?

31:06.200 --> 31:08.960
No, it's not gonna happen.
He's not interested.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.520
Fuck Gary and Charlotte the rabbits,

31:10.600 --> 31:13.680
they're shit, I want to know about
the real Gary and Charlotte.

31:13.760 --> 31:16.680
I've only been in, like, one night,
and I've already seen

31:16.760 --> 31:19.160
something totally different.
What?

31:19.240 --> 31:22.480
Like, he's just
a little bit more, like,

31:22.560 --> 31:24.800
full-on touchy-feely
with you and, like...

31:24.880 --> 31:27.040
I'm glad Marnie's back
because even though

31:27.120 --> 31:30.920
mine and Holly's friendship's getting
there, I can't talk about Gary.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.160
I don't, though, cos it's not...

31:33.240 --> 31:35.520
Cos, obviously, we spent that night
together in the cabin,

31:35.600 --> 31:37.120
but it was so good.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.240
It was just purely friends.
Yeah.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.520
And I think I've started
to fancy him again.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.840
So, what...?
Have I told anyone this?

31:44.920 --> 31:46.920
I have been getting closer to Gary,

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
but me and Marnie both know that
nothing would happen between us

31:50.080 --> 31:52.200
because he's got a girlfriend.

31:52.280 --> 31:54.040
Buzz kill!

31:54.120 --> 31:56.520
There's still
a lot of unfinished business.

31:56.600 --> 31:57.800
"Unfinished business"?

31:57.880 --> 32:00.160
What the fuck are we hanging around
with these rabbits for?

32:00.240 --> 32:02.040
We need to get out
and get some answers.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.720
Last night was such
a massive success

32:11.800 --> 32:15.120
that, tonight, we're so excited, and
we just hope that it happens again.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.600
I've bought youse
a little present in.

32:17.680 --> 32:19.840
Obviously, I didn't know
that you existed

32:19.920 --> 32:21.960
until I came in,
so I couldn't bring you anything.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.600
Presents? Presents are,
like, me favourite thing

32:24.680 --> 32:27.880
after anal douching,
which is also great.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.240
Pussy knickers?

32:31.320 --> 32:32.640
How cool!

32:32.720 --> 32:34.480
I'm the woman in a relationship,

32:34.560 --> 32:37.640
I cannot be going around
with a pussy on my pants.

32:37.720 --> 32:40.440
I feel as though these knickers
are for single girls,

32:40.520 --> 32:42.880
so, Chantelle,
I'm gonna give you mine. (laughs)

32:42.960 --> 32:46.160
Holly's just sat there and turned
her nose up at me pussy knickers.

32:46.240 --> 32:47.880
Ungrateful boring bitch.

32:49.080 --> 32:50.520
These are amazing!

32:50.600 --> 32:53.560
And my pussy pants
are identical to me vagina.

32:53.640 --> 32:56.320
Hairy, sassy and up for a laugh.

33:01.160 --> 33:03.840
Here is to the same night
as last night.

33:03.920 --> 33:06.480
No fucking arguments.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.640
You need to get things straight,
sorted with Chantelle.

33:09.880 --> 33:11.400
I'm gonna try and talk to Chantelle

33:11.480 --> 33:14.040
because, at the end of the day,
I feel bad about what happened.

33:14.120 --> 33:17.320
I'm gonna accept responsibility for
the Chloe thing. It was a dick move.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.440
And, I still do like her.

33:19.520 --> 33:22.080
And I still wanna put
my fucking bell in her.

33:25.520 --> 33:27.320
We're all ready,
we're all looking fresh,

33:27.400 --> 33:29.600
it's time to get our skates on
and get to the club.

33:33.680 --> 33:36.120
We're going to Tup Tup
to tap up the tup.

33:36.200 --> 33:37.760
Tup being cock!

33:40.520 --> 33:42.200
(all cheer)

33:42.280 --> 33:43.360
(laughter)

33:44.760 --> 33:46.600
We're in the club
and, so far, so good.

33:46.680 --> 33:48.560
But if Scott needs to talk
to Chantelle,

33:48.640 --> 33:49.920
he needs to do it soon.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.920
Howay, guys. Chill out
and just learn from the master.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.440
I am all over this
so just let Scotty T deal with it.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.560
Scott comes over to talk to us,

34:15.640 --> 34:17.720
and even though
I'm still pissed off with him,

34:17.800 --> 34:20.240
it's actually nice to have someone
to talk to tonight,

34:20.320 --> 34:22.360
since every fucker else isn't.

34:33.560 --> 34:37.800
I look over, and I can't help but
see Scott and Chantelle flirting.

34:37.880 --> 34:39.880
I am fucking pissed off, like.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.840
We're all watching
Chantelle and Scott talk,

34:48.920 --> 34:51.400
but she best not be forgiving him
before she forgives Chloe,

34:51.480 --> 34:53.000
cos that's fucking
bang out of order.

34:58.440 --> 35:01.960
I'm back speaking to Scott
and I can see Chloe looking over.

35:02.040 --> 35:05.680
Sorry, pet, your slaggy little plan
to keep him away from us

35:05.760 --> 35:10.840
by sucking his cock, didn't work,
gutted for you. Jog on.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.520
So, Chantelle's made up with Scott,

35:17.600 --> 35:19.160
so now she needs to make up
with Chloe.

35:19.240 --> 35:20.920
It was both of their fault,
after all.

35:28.680 --> 35:31.480
I tried to be there for Chantelle,
over the past couple of days

35:31.560 --> 35:32.760
but she doesn't understand,

35:32.840 --> 35:35.120
you really have to keep the girls
on your side in this house,

35:35.200 --> 35:36.880
if you don't, you're fucked.

35:45.280 --> 35:48.760
She thought, by sucking Scott's cock,
I would back off.

35:48.840 --> 35:50.920
And that's what she's wanted
all along.

35:54.440 --> 35:56.280
It's like talking
to a fucking brick wall.

35:56.360 --> 35:57.800
I tried to warn you, Chantelle.

36:17.600 --> 36:20.120
Scott and Chantelle
are rubbing it in me face.

36:20.200 --> 36:21.760
I feel like such a dick.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.040
I'm sick to death
of seeing my friend

36:26.120 --> 36:29.280
being mugged off by these two.
That's it. I've had enough.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.920
What the fuck is Marnie
even banging on about?

36:37.000 --> 36:39.080
At least she doesn't have
a drink in her hand

36:39.160 --> 36:41.200
and that is a fucking bonus.

36:48.840 --> 36:49.840
Scott is the problem.

36:49.920 --> 36:51.920
He is the reason of all this drama.

36:56.320 --> 36:58.200
Marnie is going fucking mental
at Scott.

36:58.280 --> 37:00.680
We best get home
before this kicks off.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.520
Back at the house,
everyone's mortal, everyone's angry.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.880
Scott,
you're a fucking obtuse freak.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.680
Inevitably, it starts kicking off.

37:16.760 --> 37:18.080
No! Listen!

37:18.160 --> 37:20.840
I'm avoiding this like the plague.

37:20.920 --> 37:23.560
You have this little fucking
sneaky way

37:23.640 --> 37:25.080
about worming your way in
with everyone.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.800
Aaron dragged us out the club

37:26.880 --> 37:29.560
before I got a chance to tell Scott
exactly what I think of him.

37:29.640 --> 37:31.320
And I'm not going to bed until I do.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.480
And then you fucking
wormed your way with her.

37:33.560 --> 37:36.120
She will get to see what,
exactly what you are like.

37:36.200 --> 37:38.200
Scott's getting it from Marnie,

37:38.280 --> 37:41.000
now she's turned her anger towards
Chantelle. Trust me, Chantelle,

37:41.080 --> 37:43.440
you don't wanna take on
an angry Marnie.

37:43.520 --> 37:46.200
He will never be with you.
He will NEVER...

37:46.280 --> 37:49.240
(speaking indistinctly)
You're a victim.

37:49.320 --> 37:52.120
I'm the fucking victim?
Wae'aye, Marnie.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.720
Is that why Aaron's got my name
tattooed on his wrist?

37:54.800 --> 37:56.400
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.800
The way it looks to me,
that all she was out for

37:58.880 --> 38:01.560
was fucking fucking it up
for me and him.

38:01.640 --> 38:03.360
She cared more about Scott
than she did about you.

38:04.480 --> 38:07.040
Who you telling to shut up? Who
the fuck are you telling to shut up?

38:07.120 --> 38:10.320
You. Don't fucking tell me to shut
up, you stupid bitch. Stop it!

38:10.400 --> 38:13.280
I know that this isn't my argument,
and I should be getting involved...

38:13.360 --> 38:16.200
I would never... I would never
say anything about you!

38:16.280 --> 38:19.040
...but, Chloe's my friend,
so I'm gonna stick up for her.

38:19.120 --> 38:22.280
But you are! You are, though!
I'm fucking not! Why hit me?

38:22.360 --> 38:25.880
All reet, I could understand Marnie,
cos she's fucking Chloe's bum chum,

38:25.960 --> 38:29.520
but, Holly, what the fuck
has it got to do with you?

38:29.600 --> 38:31.280
(Nathan shouts)
Don't put your hand up at me.

38:31.360 --> 38:33.560
Shut the fuck up.
What are you gonna do?

38:33.640 --> 38:36.640
(repeats) I don't give a fuck.
Get out of me fuckin' face.

38:36.720 --> 38:38.160
(squeals)
(Nathan) No!

38:38.240 --> 38:40.320
I fucking... I swear to God!

38:40.400 --> 38:42.880
(all shouting indistinctly)

38:42.960 --> 38:46.360
You fucking fuck...
(Aaron, repeats) It's not working.

38:46.440 --> 38:50.640
Shit. This has got way out of hand.
Holly's up in Chantelle's face

38:50.720 --> 38:52.520
and Scott's taking it out
on the phone box.

38:52.600 --> 38:55.600
(indistinct shouting and arguing)

38:56.880 --> 38:59.640
In all honesty, I don't know
how any of this started

38:59.720 --> 39:02.600
but it needs to fucking stop
and it needs to stop now.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.520
(Aaron) Yes, you're pretty!
(Chloe) No, I'm not!

39:18.880 --> 39:21.000
I'm outside trying to get away
from the madness,

39:21.080 --> 39:22.280
and out comes Chantelle.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.440
I'm not being funny, but if she's
here to peck my fucking head off,

39:25.520 --> 39:26.920
she can sling a fucking hook.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.800
My whole goal for tonight
was just to make up with you.

39:29.880 --> 39:32.200
And... Not make up in the sense
I was gonna get back with you,

39:32.280 --> 39:35.960
I wanted to at least give the option
that I had you as a friend again.

39:36.040 --> 39:40.160
They've all acted like idiots, and...
Why you looking at us like that?

39:40.240 --> 39:42.440
Cos you're drawing us in.

39:42.520 --> 39:44.200
And I shouldn't let you,
but you are.

39:44.280 --> 39:46.480
I'm drawing you... Drawing...
Drawing what?

39:46.560 --> 39:50.120
Although Scott's been absolute dick,
he's sitting there and apologising,

39:50.200 --> 39:51.760
and I cannot help but like him.

39:57.960 --> 40:01.600
I'm kissing him, and I'm not gonna
lie, I'm not regretting it, at all.

40:01.680 --> 40:05.440
Cos I do like him,
and I am going to piss Chloe off.

40:05.520 --> 40:07.160
I told you I'd have the last laugh.

40:10.880 --> 40:14.680
(Chloe) Am I seeing things?
Chantelle and Scott straddling!

40:14.760 --> 40:16.160
Are you fucking joking?

40:16.240 --> 40:17.920
Are you having me fucking life.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
(Charlotte, whispers) What?

40:29.080 --> 40:31.720
What?
(whimpers)

40:32.800 --> 40:34.800
(exhales)

40:34.880 --> 40:36.440
(speaks indistinctly)

40:37.720 --> 40:39.840
Really, guys? REALLY?

40:39.920 --> 40:41.320
Oh, fuck.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.720
(screams)

40:45.080 --> 40:47.200
(continues screaming)

40:47.280 --> 40:49.080
I'm so fucking angry!

40:49.160 --> 40:52.440
(shouting indistinctly)
(Holly) CHLOE!

40:52.520 --> 40:55.800
Chloe has lost it
and now she's smashing up the house.

40:55.880 --> 40:58.040
(screams)

40:58.120 --> 41:00.800
WHY? Fucking hell!

41:00.880 --> 41:02.840
This night
has been an absolute disaster.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.040
(shouts indistinctly)

41:04.120 --> 41:06.920
Recently, all this family has done
is fucking argue.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.880
So let's hope
we can get it fucking sorted.

41:13.520 --> 41:15.480
I know that, one day,
Chloe's gonna find someone

41:15.560 --> 41:17.440
far, far better than Scott,
who she deserves.

41:17.520 --> 41:19.440
but, right now,
she's young, she's daft,

41:19.520 --> 41:20.720
and she doesn't understand.

41:20.800 --> 41:22.800
Night-night. I love you so much.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.840
I don't even know why I love Scott,
the way he treats us.

41:24.920 --> 41:27.440
but I just can't get over him,
for fuck's sake!

41:31.600 --> 41:34.320
(Chantelle laughs)
Tonight has been fucking mental.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.280
But it's all turned 'round
for Scotty T.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.080
So, Chantelle, let me show you

41:38.160 --> 41:40.160
where Daddy is gonna
put you to bed tonight.

41:40.240 --> 41:42.920
(kissing)

41:43.000 --> 41:44.880
Once again, it's totally kicked off

41:44.960 --> 41:47.920
but the arguments have seemed to
bring me and Scott closer together.

41:50.800 --> 41:52.960
You've messed with the wrong girl
this time, Chloe.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.840
Good night, sleep tight,
don't let the bed bugs bite.
