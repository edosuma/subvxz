can't do anything right.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.851

from a president

00:16.935 --> 00:19.478

00:19.562 --> 00:21.313

00:21.397 --> 00:24.442

for Titus from Columbia House.

00:28.070 --> 00:29.113
Also...

00:29.196 --> 00:31.156
there's a letter for a Kimmy--

00:31.240 --> 00:32.784
Oh, no, never mind,

00:32.867 --> 00:36.495
because this is
for Kimmy Schmidt.

00:36.579 --> 00:37.914
Oh, that's probably
for me, actually.

00:37.997 --> 00:39.832
You know, Schmidt
sounds a lot like Smith.

00:39.916 --> 00:43.544
So you're saying
that you're Kimberly Schmidt?

00:43.628 --> 00:44.921
It's probably
from my friend Cyndee.

is starting,

01:09.111 --> 01:10.529

my struggles.

01:30.716 --> 01:32.426
Why do I have to go
to a stupid trial?

I never want to see
the stupid Reverend again.

01:34.345 --> 01:35.888
And why stupid now?

"It's Dale Earnhardt.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.662
I'll never forget
where I was

08:57.746 --> 09:00.207
when Tristafé asked me
to join the front row.

09:00.291 --> 09:02.334
I was in spin class.

09:02.418 --> 09:03.961
I bet you'll be moving up soon.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.379
You must have had
an amazing trainer

09:05.463 --> 09:06.671
down in the bunker.

09:06.755 --> 09:07.839
Um...

09:07.923 --> 09:09.383
I'm not running a restaurant
here, Gretchen.

09:09.467 --> 09:10.509
This is dinner.

09:10.592 --> 09:11.635
[gasps]
Kimmy!

09:11.718 --> 09:12.761
A little higher.

09:12.844 --> 09:13.887
Sorry.

09:13.971 --> 09:15.931
- How's that?
- Yeah.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.557
That was actually
one of the things

09:17.641 --> 09:19.351
I was trying
not to think about.

09:19.435 --> 09:21.270
But now I'm thinking about
the bunker and the Reverend

09:21.353 --> 09:22.729
and Dong getting deported

09:22.813 --> 09:24.523
and that time I called
my teacher "Mommy."

09:24.648 --> 09:26.775
[cell phone ringing]

09:26.858 --> 09:28.360
Oh, no, not Cyndee.

09:28.444 --> 09:30.654
[cell phone vibrating]

09:30.737 --> 09:33.198
Oh, now I'm thinking
about my divorce

09:33.282 --> 09:35.033
and being on my own
and how I had to listen

09:35.117 --> 09:37.411
to that list of things
you were thinking about.

09:37.495 --> 09:39.037
When's the next class?

09:41.873 --> 09:43.792
Hey, Kimmy,
it's Cyndee Pokorny.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.336
We were kidnapped together.

09:45.419 --> 09:46.753
Uh, just wondering
where you are,

09:46.837 --> 09:48.297
'cause it's going
real good here,

09:48.380 --> 09:50.424
except it's going real bad.

09:50.508 --> 09:52.634
Reverend Richard
is a great man.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.428
He didn't kidnap us.
He saved us.

09:54.512 --> 09:56.138
And he would have saved
everyone

09:56.221 --> 09:58.765
if he wasn't so worried
about it being a sausage fest.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.602
I'd like to use
one of our do-overs, please.

10:02.686 --> 10:06.190
[in Spanish] He's a monster!
He deserves to rot in jail!

10:07.107 --> 10:08.150
Does anybody here
speak Spanish?

10:08.233 --> 10:09.276
Of course.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.902
She said that the bunker
was great,

10:10.986 --> 10:13.030
and she'd do it again.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.781
Mm!

10:14.865 --> 10:17.159
I think you might have me
confused with someone else.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.411
I've never been to Durnsville
in my life.

10:19.495 --> 10:22.622
Yeah,
you're a surprise witness.

10:22.706 --> 10:25.376
If we knew who you were,
it wouldn't be a surprise.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.087
Anyhoo, you got to get here.

10:29.171 --> 10:30.672
I'm supposed
to testify tomorrow,

10:30.755 --> 10:32.632
and you know how tricky
the Reverend is.

10:35.511 --> 10:36.887
And our lawyers
don't seem to know

10:36.970 --> 10:38.763
what the heck they're doing!

10:38.847 --> 10:39.890
How do you think
that went, Cyndee?

10:39.973 --> 10:41.266
B?
B-plus?

10:41.350 --> 10:43.643
So is this
your first case or...?

10:43.727 --> 10:45.020
- [chuckling]
- Ah, I love it.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.022
See, this is why we moved
here-- Anonymity.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.191
In Durnsville,
we're just Marcia and Chris,

10:49.274 --> 10:52.110
not famously incompetent
California prosecutors.

10:52.194 --> 10:53.737
Hey, he's in jail now.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.448
So who has four thumbs
and loosened that jelly jar?

10:57.282 --> 10:58.534
[both chuckle]

10:58.617 --> 10:59.659
The only thing
that's important here

10:59.743 --> 11:00.827
is for me and you

11:00.911 --> 11:03.247
to see where this
relationship can go.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.664
Yeah.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.671
Pedal, pedal.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.757
Be like a drunk girl
getting out of a cab,

11:13.840 --> 11:15.884
and leave everything behind--

11:15.967 --> 11:18.345
Your bag, your keys!

11:18.429 --> 11:20.222
Yes, that ginger in the corner

11:20.305 --> 11:22.891
is going to have to call
her landlord from a pay phone!

11:22.974 --> 11:24.101
Whoo!

11:24.184 --> 11:26.770
Scream, you drunk mess!
Scream!

11:26.853 --> 11:29.648
Turn your resistance
all the way up to Gandhi.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.316
Oh!

11:31.400 --> 11:33.235
Oh, it's supposed to hurt.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.986
It's Gandhi.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.821
Whoo!

11:36.905 --> 11:38.407
Follow your bliss--

11:38.490 --> 11:39.824
trademark Tristafé.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.202
Imagine yourself
on a beautiful beach,

11:42.286 --> 11:43.328
on a bicycle!

11:43.412 --> 11:44.704
I see a dolphin!

11:44.788 --> 11:46.331
Yes, it's beautiful.

11:46.415 --> 11:47.499
I see it, too.

11:47.583 --> 11:48.626
You're a liar!

11:48.708 --> 11:50.502
You see no dolphin.

11:50.586 --> 11:52.712
Tell me more
of the dolphin, ginger.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.673
There is only here.

11:54.756 --> 11:57.426
There is only now.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.177
My mind is so blank,

11:59.261 --> 12:01.388
I don't even know
how to "tark anymelg."

12:03.056 --> 12:05.016
And so we are done.

12:07.311 --> 12:08.353
[all clap]

12:08.437 --> 12:10.063
And unclip, ladies.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.990
I prefer my students
in ponytails

12:20.073 --> 12:21.617
so I can imagine them...

12:21.700 --> 12:23.452
as ponies.

12:24.662 --> 12:27.289
Tcha-kamo, feenahnay.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.340
Can you believe
we biked all day?

12:36.423 --> 12:37.633
Tristafé is amazing.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.176
[mockingly]
"Tristafé is amazing."

12:39.259 --> 12:40.511
That sounded exactly like me.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.095
That was like
listening to a mirror.

12:42.179 --> 12:44.139
Be quiet, Kimmy.

12:47.559 --> 12:48.768
And clean that up.

12:48.852 --> 12:50.395
But Tristafé says--

12:50.479 --> 12:54.024
You don't tell me
what Tristafé says.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.026
I brought you to SpiritCycle.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.944
And how do you repay me?

12:58.028 --> 13:00.489
You take my bike and exile me
to the second row

13:00.572 --> 13:02.824
with those sloppy
baby-weight disasters.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.035
Tristafé warned me
you would lash out tonight.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.411
Oh, really?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.706
And exactly when did you have

13:08.788 --> 13:10.999
a private conversation
with Tristafé?

13:11.082 --> 13:12.834
The front row
had a cucumber-water cool-down

13:12.917 --> 13:14.211
with him after class.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.920
Now I guess I'll have
to tell Tristafé

13:16.004 --> 13:18.256
that you forgot your place
and yelled at a first-row bike.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.383
No.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.967
No, no, please!

13:21.051 --> 13:22.427
- Please.
- Good.

13:22.511 --> 13:24.596
Now drink.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.390
Ha, ah...

13:26.473 --> 13:28.642
I can taste your power.

13:28.726 --> 13:30.018
Mmm.

13:31.770 --> 13:32.812
What are you doing here?

13:32.896 --> 13:34.314
The trial started already.

13:34.398 --> 13:36.024
Titus, I've decided
I'm not going.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.651
What?
But you have to!

13:37.735 --> 13:40.195
The only thing I have to do
is follow my bliss.

13:40.278 --> 13:43.031
And Indiana is nowhere near
my mind beach.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.742
What white nonsense is this?

13:44.824 --> 13:46.493
It's SpiritCycle.

13:46.577 --> 13:48.453
And Tristafé is teaching me
to leave everything behind,

13:48.537 --> 13:49.663
like a toddler
at an out-of-state

13:49.747 --> 13:50.789
fast-food restaurant.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.499
Listen to me.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.125
Your lawyers' opening statement
was mostly a slideshow

13:54.209 --> 13:55.544
of their trip
to see the fall colors.

13:55.627 --> 13:56.795
If you don't go down there,

13:56.878 --> 13:58.463
they might set
the Reverend free.

13:58.547 --> 14:01.675
That has nothing
to do with this.

14:03.093 --> 14:05.845
Kimmy... Kimmy...

14:05.929 --> 14:07.347
Okay, bye.

14:26.157 --> 14:28.159
[clacking keys]

14:29.327 --> 14:31.663
[Reverend Richard] Ms. Pokorny,
we've never met before, have we?

14:31.747 --> 14:33.915
Yes, you kept me
in an underground bunker

14:33.998 --> 14:35.375
for 15 years.

14:35.459 --> 14:37.001
That's weird,

14:37.085 --> 14:39.588
because in your deposition,
you describe this man,

14:39.671 --> 14:42.716
or more likely... woman,

14:42.800 --> 14:44.760
as having a big, bushy beard.

14:44.843 --> 14:45.885
Yes, that's right.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.679
A beard?

14:47.763 --> 14:49.389
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

14:49.473 --> 14:51.182
do you see a beard?

14:51.266 --> 14:53.518
[all gasping]

14:54.227 --> 14:57.105
I told you I'm not very good
at math, Ms. Pokorny.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.065
I've been very up front
about that.

14:59.149 --> 15:02.360
But even to me,
your story doesn't add up.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.572
He makes some
really good points.

15:05.656 --> 15:07.240
I can see
where he's coming from.

15:07.324 --> 15:08.659
Reasonable doubt, you know?

15:08.742 --> 15:11.745
[all murmuring]

15:11.829 --> 15:14.164
Find your beach,
my little ponies.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.874
The sun is shining.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.669
The waves are crashing.
The--

15:18.752 --> 15:21.630
Jacqueline, get off my beach.
Find your own.

15:21.713 --> 15:24.174
This isn't fair to people
with no imagination.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.349
I'm there!

15:32.432 --> 15:35.143
It's beautiful!

15:35.226 --> 15:36.687
[Cyndee] Kimmy!

15:36.770 --> 15:38.938
Kimmy, wait up!

15:39.022 --> 15:41.483
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here!

15:41.566 --> 15:44.235
Neither should you.
We need you in Durnsville.

15:44.319 --> 15:45.779
No, I'm not going.

15:45.863 --> 15:47.531
This only proves
that the Reverend was right.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.407
Without him,
we turn against each other,

15:49.491 --> 15:52.536
like when Dylan tells the whole
team that David is Jewish

15:52.619 --> 15:54.412
in School Ties.

15:54.496 --> 15:55.789
[in Spanish]
For a man who thinks Jews

15:55.873 --> 15:56.915
come from outer space,

15:56.998 --> 16:00.585
the reverend sure
loves School Ties.

16:03.839 --> 16:06.717
[Cyndee] Kimmy, no!
Don't leave us!

16:12.389 --> 16:14.224
I'm sorry.
It just doesn't fit.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.975
Really?
Darn it.

16:18.186 --> 16:21.022
I swear, I'm gonna find out
who this glove belongs to.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.524
I know.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.150
Now...

16:25.109 --> 16:26.152
Reverend...

16:29.030 --> 16:30.782
If you were me...

16:30.866 --> 16:32.450
what would you ask you?

16:32.534 --> 16:33.785
Well, if I were you,

16:33.869 --> 16:37.288
I would ask me about...

16:37.372 --> 16:38.540
[strums a chord]

16:38.623 --> 16:40.542
♪ A long, long time ago ♪

16:40.625 --> 16:41.668
[applause]

16:41.752 --> 16:44.212
♪ I can still remember... ♪

16:44.295 --> 16:45.797
Why doesn't someone ask him

16:45.881 --> 16:47.632
how come after the apocalypse
didn't happen

16:47.716 --> 16:49.050
he didn't let us go?

16:49.133 --> 16:51.010
- Sit down and shut up!
- Shut your mouth!

16:51.094 --> 16:52.470
[Reverend Richard]
No, it's a fair question.

16:52.554 --> 16:54.389
You see, I worked for years

16:54.472 --> 16:58.435
on figuring out
the date of the apocalypse--

16:58.518 --> 16:59.895
June 6, 2006,

16:59.978 --> 17:01.646
6-6-6.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.648
It came to me while I was
watching Sesame Street.

17:03.732 --> 17:07.068
The number of the day was 9,
and I was in my gravity boots.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.153
But when that day
came and went,

17:09.237 --> 17:11.489
I felt like a real heel.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.408
What can I say?

17:13.491 --> 17:15.076
I'm hard on myself.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.078
But I wasn't about
to give up on those girls,

17:17.161 --> 17:21.040
because I, or whoever
was down in that bunker,

17:21.124 --> 17:24.628
had them in there since 1998,

17:24.711 --> 17:26.671
getting ready for the Rapture.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.882
And you know how long
it takes ladies to get ready.

17:28.966 --> 17:31.384
[laughing]
This one.

17:31.468 --> 17:32.510
Oh, pfft.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.262
My point is,
what if I had let them out

17:34.345 --> 17:36.723
and then the Rapture happened,
like, two days later?

17:36.807 --> 17:39.017
Because the Bible says...

17:39.100 --> 17:41.853
it's coming.

17:41.937 --> 17:44.105
And I know it's coming soon.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.899
That doesn't scare me.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.819
The signs are all around you
if you just open your eyes.

17:50.194 --> 17:53.615
Men debasing themselves
for pleasure...

17:55.033 --> 17:57.995
and the few good among us...

17:58.077 --> 17:59.287
That's me.

17:59.370 --> 18:00.538
I'm good.

18:00.622 --> 18:03.708
Powerless against
the faceless evil

18:03.792 --> 18:06.837
of petty tyranny...

18:06.920 --> 18:08.797
just like in School Ties.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.843
The library is closed.

18:12.926 --> 18:16.387
I'm powerless against the
faceless evil of petty tyranny.

18:16.471 --> 18:17.848
Oh, God!

18:17.931 --> 18:19.474
It's happening!

18:22.226 --> 18:25.689
Evil will rise
from the depths of the Earth.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.691
Bottles and models, bitches!

18:27.774 --> 18:28.817
Ugh!

18:28.900 --> 18:31.736
What white nonsense was that?

18:32.320 --> 18:34.781
Woman shall lie with beast.

18:34.865 --> 18:36.407
[smooching]

18:36.491 --> 18:37.993
Get a hold
of yourself, Titus.

18:38.076 --> 18:40.745
And the Devil herself
shall appear in a cloud of smoke

18:40.829 --> 18:43.790
and drag you down
to the foulest pit of hell.

18:43.874 --> 18:46.043
[screaming]

18:46.125 --> 18:47.794
Hey, Titus.

18:47.878 --> 18:50.129
You want to go
to Boston Market?

18:50.213 --> 18:51.882
It's the Devil!

18:51.965 --> 18:54.592
Ha!
I'm not the Devil.

18:54.676 --> 18:59.180
The sulfur smell is 'cause I'm
doing a hard-boiled egg cleanse.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.933
Lillian, I got sucked in
by a crazy person,

19:02.017 --> 19:04.227
and I started to believe
what he was saying.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.104
And if that happened to me,
with my iron will...

19:06.187 --> 19:07.230
Iron will!

19:07.313 --> 19:08.773
[laughs]

19:08.857 --> 19:12.193
You couldn't even stay standing
for this whole conversation.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.445
My point is,
that man is dangerous,

19:14.529 --> 19:15.989
and he must be stopped,

19:16.073 --> 19:17.824
and there's only one person
who can do it.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.454
Kimberly,
that man is dangerous.

19:23.538 --> 19:24.581
No, get off my beach.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.124
Get your beach out of my

19:26.207 --> 19:28.001
Olympic men's
figure skating locker room.

19:28.085 --> 19:29.836
We all have our fantasies.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.504
That monster told you
how to dress,

19:31.588 --> 19:33.297
how to wear your hair,
what to think.

19:33.381 --> 19:34.632
He locked you up and told you

19:34.716 --> 19:35.759
the outside world
didn't exist anymore,

19:35.842 --> 19:36.885
and you believed him.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.011
No, I didn't.

19:38.095 --> 19:39.971
I never believed a word
the Reverend said.

19:40.055 --> 19:41.639
I'm not talking
about the Reverend.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.683
I'm talking about him.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.894
Tristafé?
No, he's not--

19:45.977 --> 19:47.520
Look at yourself,
"girlfrenemy"--

19:47.604 --> 19:49.355
the clothes, the hair.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.149
You walk around
spouting his gibberish.

19:51.232 --> 19:52.734
Of course
he spouts gibberish.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.445
He studied spirit biking
in Giberia.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.572
And I'm not locked up anywhere.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.198
I can go wherever I want.

20:02.953 --> 20:05.038
I just can't unclip my shoes.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.043
Oh!

20:10.127 --> 20:12.129
Oh, my goodness,
are you okay?

20:14.172 --> 20:16.049
SpiritCycle is a cult.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.176
It's just another cult.

20:18.259 --> 20:21.220
Why does this keep happening?
What's wrong with me?

20:21.304 --> 20:24.141
But it could happen to anyone.
It almost happened to me.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.143
You, with your iron will?

20:26.225 --> 20:28.394
That's what I said.

20:28.478 --> 20:29.771
You're right.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.355
I have to go to Durnsville.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.274
Kimberly, when I first heard
about your dealio,

20:33.357 --> 20:37.154
all I cared about was
the lurid, titillating details.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.114
Like how we built Can Man
to practice kissing on,

20:39.197 --> 20:40.573
and we only had one rule--

20:40.657 --> 20:42.241
Don't fall in love
with Can Man?

20:42.325 --> 20:43.660
But Can Man
was irresistible?

20:43.743 --> 20:45.703
No. No.

20:45.787 --> 20:47.538
All I care about
is helping my friend.

20:47.622 --> 20:50.792
So... I'm coming with you.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.335
You'd do that for me?

20:52.418 --> 20:53.962
So I can see the trial
without ads.

20:54.045 --> 20:55.088
Sorry!

20:55.172 --> 20:56.422
I meant...

20:56.506 --> 20:58.341
so I can see the trial
without ads.

20:58.424 --> 21:01.552
I'm really trying
to be supportive here.

21:03.013 --> 21:04.388
I'm your friend.

21:04.472 --> 21:06.390
So I'm gonna come
to Durnsville with you,

21:06.474 --> 21:09.060
so I can see the trial
without ads.

21:09.144 --> 21:11.188
Thanks, Titus.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.440
I just need to take care
of something first.

21:14.524 --> 21:16.901
[ominous music]

21:16.985 --> 21:18.611
[chuckles]

21:21.990 --> 21:24.951
Time to clip in.
[chuckles]

21:34.836 --> 21:37.338
[women scream]

21:37.421 --> 21:38.464
Ladies!

21:38.548 --> 21:39.590
And gay guy.

21:39.674 --> 21:43.136
This is a spin-tervention.

21:43.220 --> 21:44.888
That man is a fraud!

21:44.971 --> 21:46.639
Kimmy, how dare you?

21:46.723 --> 21:48.307
I gifted you
with the sacred words--

21:48.391 --> 21:49.893
Tcha-kamo, feenahnay.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.310
Sacred words?

21:51.394 --> 21:52.729
"Tcha-kamo, feenahnay"

21:52.812 --> 21:54.189
is from Iko Iko,

21:54.272 --> 21:56.524
from the Rain Man soundtrack.

21:56.607 --> 21:58.526
Is that a brand-new
cassette tape

21:58.609 --> 22:00.070
of the Rain Man soundtrack?

22:00.153 --> 22:02.280
And his name isn't Tristafé.

22:02.363 --> 22:03.990
It's Christopher!

22:04.074 --> 22:05.324
[all gasp]

22:05.408 --> 22:06.993
He just pronounces it
like an idiot.

22:07.077 --> 22:08.578
You ever wonder
why it's so dark in here?

22:08.661 --> 22:10.288
Kimmy, don't touch those.

22:11.622 --> 22:14.209
[all] Oh!

22:14.292 --> 22:16.086
And he's not even
pedaling his bike.

22:16.169 --> 22:17.378
It's just a video.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.463
That's how he does
ten classes a day.

22:19.547 --> 22:21.340
Kimmy, don't move
that monitor.

22:21.424 --> 22:22.508
[all] Oh!

22:22.592 --> 22:24.677
Don't judge!
IBS is real!

22:24.761 --> 22:27.305
He was on the toilet
the whole time?

22:27.388 --> 22:30.016
Oh, God.
That's what the candles are for.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.768
They're also to set the mood.

22:31.851 --> 22:35.313
Why do we keep doing this
to ourselves,

22:35.396 --> 22:38.316
replacing one stupid male
authority figure with another,

22:38.399 --> 22:41.027
like Days of Our Lives
replaces Roman Bradys.

22:41.111 --> 22:42.445
I like the first Roman.

22:42.528 --> 22:43.780
You're a moron!

22:43.863 --> 22:45.740
Sorry.
That's just wrong.

22:45.823 --> 22:48.576
Jacqueline, is Christopher here
really any different

22:48.659 --> 22:50.036
than Julian?

22:50.120 --> 22:51.788
Is he different than any guy
who tells you

22:51.871 --> 22:54.082
he'll make you richer
or prettier or safer

22:54.165 --> 22:56.126
if you just let him
make all the decisions?

22:56.209 --> 22:57.961
But when it's time
to look at fabric swatches

22:58.044 --> 22:59.921
for the banquette,
he's got no opinion.

23:00.004 --> 23:01.589
Sure, that.

23:02.924 --> 23:04.134
Kimmy...

23:04.217 --> 23:06.261
I need to find out
who I really am,

23:06.344 --> 23:08.805
not just wait for some guy
to come and tell me.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.473
And I need a few days off.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.809
I'm going to Durnsville
to testify against the Reverend.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.393
Oh, Kimmy.

23:14.477 --> 23:17.272
I'll dock
your pay accordingly.

23:17.355 --> 23:19.565
[toilet flushes]

23:19.649 --> 23:22.485
Usually you can't hear that
'cause of the music.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.907
All right, ladies,
today is a gift.

23:27.991 --> 23:29.450
That's why we call it
the present.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.786
Let's lock and load.

24:39.854 --> 24:40.897
Good night, everybody!
