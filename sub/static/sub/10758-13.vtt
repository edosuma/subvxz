00:08.467 --> 00:11.637
<i>So Dr. Crane, I don't see
why I should fix the dumb dress</i>

00:11.803 --> 00:13.722
<i>when my sister
can't even fit into it anymore.</i>

00:13.889 --> 00:17.809
Audrey, you borrowed the dress,
you tore it.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.896
As an old Greek haberdasher
once said:

00:21.063 --> 00:24.566
"Euripides, Eumenides."

00:26.276 --> 00:27.819
<i>What?</i>

00:27.986 --> 00:32.698
Well, it's just a little joke
on the ancient dramatist Euripides

00:32.866 --> 00:34.701
and the mythological Furies.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.539
Just fix the dress.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.292
We'll be back after the weather.

00:43.126 --> 00:46.296
Oh, Roz, Noel gave me this
to give to you.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.256
- Here.
- Oh, God, Noel.

00:48.423 --> 00:51.384
- He's been acting so weird lately.
- Lately?

00:51.551 --> 00:53.720
May I remind you this is the man
who's required by law

00:53.887 --> 00:57.140
to stay at least 100 yards away
from William Shatner.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.934
No, I bumped into him at Nervosa
about a month ago.

01:00.101 --> 01:02.187
There were no other free tables
so we sat together,

01:02.353 --> 01:04.938
and since then, he's been acting
like we're some kind of couple.

01:05.105 --> 01:07.358
Oh, Roz, I'm sure he knows
you're not interested in him.

01:07.692 --> 01:10.195
- "Happy monthiversary."
- Oh, Lord.

01:11.279 --> 01:13.323
Oh, we're on.

01:14.449 --> 01:17.744
And we're back.
Let's get straight to the phones.

01:18.244 --> 01:20.455
<i>- I'm listening.
- Dr. Crane?</i>

01:20.622 --> 01:23.166
<i>It's Woody.
I'm in Seattle and I'm a little lost.</i>

01:23.333 --> 01:26.961
Well, Woody, in today's fast-paced,
high-pressure society,

01:27.128 --> 01:28.463
that's not uncommon.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.673
Just why exactly do you feel lost?

01:30.840 --> 01:32.842
<i>Well, I've been driving around
for about an hour.</i>

01:33.009 --> 01:35.219
<i>I can't seem to get out of the airport.</i>

01:37.513 --> 01:39.766
Oh, Woody, Woody.

01:39.932 --> 01:45.188
Oh, well, listeners, this is an old friend
of mine from back in Boston.

01:45.354 --> 01:47.690
Well, how are you doing there,
you old cowpoke?

01:47.857 --> 01:50.860
<i>I'm doing okay, but all this talk
about today's fast-paced,</i>

01:51.027 --> 01:53.571
<i>high-pressure world
is starting to get me down.</i>

01:53.738 --> 01:56.532
Yes, well, I have just the cure for that.
How about dinner?

01:56.699 --> 01:58.451
<i>Sounds great. I'm in town all week.</i>

01:58.618 --> 02:01.829
<i>- And I'm free all week. How's tonight?
- Oh, that'd be great.</i>

02:01.996 --> 02:05.249
<i>- So I hear you're on the radio.
- Yes, I am, Woody, and so are you.</i>

02:05.416 --> 02:09.377
<i>No, no, no,
I'm still tending bar at Cheers.</i>

02:10.503 --> 02:13.257
<i>Oh, how do these rumours
get started?</i>

02:13.424 --> 02:14.884
Believe it or not, listeners,

02:15.051 --> 02:18.345
Woody and I are picking up
right where we left off.

02:21.140 --> 02:23.726
- Knock, knock.
- Noel.

02:23.893 --> 02:30.149
Oh, I haven't seen that outfit before.
Set your phasers on stunning.

02:31.192 --> 02:34.236
Listen, I need to talk to you.
I cannot accept anniversary gifts.

02:34.403 --> 02:36.822
Oh, I know that.
I was just making a little joke.

02:36.989 --> 02:38.449
I know we're just friends.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.743
I saw this
and it made me think of you.

02:41.160 --> 02:44.121
Okay, thanks. That's really sweet.

02:44.288 --> 02:46.165
Oh, if you're not gonna open it
for a while,

02:46.332 --> 02:47.666
you might wanna move the ribbon.

02:47.833 --> 02:50.919
It's blocking the air holes.

02:55.924 --> 02:58.302
Here, I made you some lamb stew.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.971
I'm telling you,
there's something weird about Eddie.

03:01.138 --> 03:03.140
Oh, for the love of God,
not this again.

03:03.307 --> 03:05.392
You never should've taken him
to those dog groomers.

03:05.559 --> 03:06.602
I had to bring him.

03:06.768 --> 03:11.106
His toenails were like Howard Hughes'
and his breath smelled like an autopsy.

03:11.273 --> 03:13.275
Well, look at him.
They did something to him.

03:13.442 --> 03:14.985
The sparkle's gone from his eyes.

03:15.152 --> 03:17.988
Yes, and so are
those gooey green bits.

03:18.613 --> 03:22.159
Oh, that's probably Woody. I'll get it.

03:24.119 --> 03:25.579
- Oh, Niles.
- Hello, Frasier.

03:25.746 --> 03:28.123
I know this is impromptu,
but I'm going to an oboe recital

03:28.290 --> 03:29.875
and I thought
you might want to join me.

03:30.041 --> 03:31.543
Well, I'm sorry, Niles.

03:31.710 --> 03:34.796
An old friend of mine came in town.
I invited him to come over this evening.

03:34.963 --> 03:37.841
Well, have him join us. I'm sure
we can get three seats together.

03:38.008 --> 03:40.260
I'm not sure an oboe recital's
quite what I had in mind.

03:40.427 --> 03:42.429
I was thinking of something
a little more raucous.

03:42.971 --> 03:45.640
If it's raucous you're looking for,
we could go and get a nightcap

03:45.807 --> 03:47.392
at the piano bar
at the Mayflower Hotel.

03:47.559 --> 03:49.352
It's Jerome Kern night.

03:51.187 --> 03:55.191
Last time people were shouting out
requests without raising their hands.

03:56.067 --> 03:58.820
You know, Niles,
I'm afraid we'll have to pass.

03:58.987 --> 04:00.989
You see, my friend Woody
is an old bar chum

04:01.156 --> 04:02.824
from back at Cheers...

04:03.241 --> 04:05.618
What I had in mind
was really more of a beer-swilling,

04:05.785 --> 04:07.954
back-slapping kind of night,
if you know what I mean.

04:08.121 --> 04:09.664
You're welcome to join us if you like.

04:09.831 --> 04:11.374
- Sounds interesting.
- Well, now...

04:12.041 --> 04:14.586
- Woody!
- Hey, Dr. Crane!

04:14.752 --> 04:17.839
- Good to see you.
- You look great.

04:18.005 --> 04:19.798
Oh, thanks, thanks. You too.

04:19.966 --> 04:21.885
- This place is awesome.
- Thank you.

04:22.051 --> 04:25.638
I'm not surprised you need all
these roommates to help you pay for it.

04:26.347 --> 04:29.017
Well, they're not really roommates,
Woody. They're...

04:29.475 --> 04:31.769
They're more like boarders actually.

04:31.936 --> 04:34.981
- No, that's my father, Martin.
- Oh, hi.

04:35.148 --> 04:36.983
- Woody Boyd.
- I remember hearing about you.

04:37.150 --> 04:39.235
- You were a policeman, right?
- That's right.

04:39.402 --> 04:40.903
That's my brother right there, Niles.

04:41.070 --> 04:43.406
- He's a psychiatrist too.
- Hello.

04:43.573 --> 04:46.325
And this is Daphne Moon,
my father's home healthcare worker.

04:46.492 --> 04:49.162
- It's nice to meet you.
- Oh, hi. I like your accent.

04:49.328 --> 04:51.914
- You're from England, right?
- Manchester.

04:52.081 --> 04:54.834
Darn. I'm usually pretty good at that.

04:56.586 --> 05:00.882
- Oh, hey, who's this little guy?
- I'm not sure I even know anymore.

05:01.048 --> 05:03.884
Oh, my dad's getting the same way.

05:04.927 --> 05:07.763
- So, Woody, can I get you a beer?
- That's funny, huh?

05:07.930 --> 05:09.849
You know, all those years
I was waiting on you,

05:10.016 --> 05:11.559
and now you're getting me a beer.

05:11.726 --> 05:13.602
Yes, life's like that sometimes,
isn't it?

05:13.769 --> 05:16.313
Daphne, get us a couple of beers,
will you?

05:17.815 --> 05:20.693
So, what brings you to Seattle, huh?

05:20.860 --> 05:23.279
- Oh, my cousin's getting married.
- Really?

05:23.446 --> 05:24.864
Which is the cousin? Bride or groom?

05:25.030 --> 05:27.199
Well, actually, both are.

05:30.286 --> 05:32.204
I assume they're kissing cousins.

05:32.371 --> 05:35.082
They're doing a lot more than that.

05:35.833 --> 05:38.419
That's why they have to get married.

05:40.963 --> 05:42.923
So is Kelly with you?

05:43.090 --> 05:47.511
No, no, she's visiting her mom
with the kids, but she sends her love.

05:48.053 --> 05:51.223
- And how's the old gang, huh?
- Oh, well, they haven't changed much.

05:51.390 --> 05:53.809
Sam's doing great, Carla's terrific.

05:53.976 --> 05:56.186
Oh, you know,
we almost had a wedding.

05:56.353 --> 05:59.982
Mr. Clavin got himself one of those
Eastern European mail-order brides.

06:00.149 --> 06:04.194
But they lived together for a couple
of days and decided to call it off.

06:04.361 --> 06:06.488
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry for Cliff.

06:06.655 --> 06:09.074
Yeah, she said she was homesick.

06:09.241 --> 06:12.411
That Bosnia
must be a beautiful place.

06:15.289 --> 06:17.916
- Here we are.
- Oh, thank you, Daphne.

06:18.083 --> 06:20.794
That's one for you, one for you,

06:20.961 --> 06:23.380
and one for me.

06:23.547 --> 06:26.049
Well, Woody, I thought that tonight
we'd just maybe stay in.

06:26.216 --> 06:28.385
- You know, order some pizza.
- Sounds good by me.

06:28.552 --> 06:30.804
Okay, great. I'll just call the place
around the corner.

06:30.971 --> 06:33.932
- Niles, you're gonna join us?
- Well, why not.

06:34.099 --> 06:35.475
It'll be fun to drink some beer

06:35.642 --> 06:38.186
and have some pizza
with a couple of rapscallions.

06:38.353 --> 06:42.691
If you don't mind, could we make that
half rapscallions, half pepperoni?

06:49.656 --> 06:51.908
That wasn't
the best prank we played.

06:52.075 --> 06:53.868
You remember that time
with Mr. Clavin?

06:54.035 --> 06:56.788
Oh, yes, and the ferret.

06:59.499 --> 07:01.459
He was about to go on his route,

07:01.626 --> 07:04.879
and we shoved that angry ferret
into his mailbag.

07:05.046 --> 07:08.550
Oh, my. Exactly how
do you make a ferret angry?

07:08.717 --> 07:12.220
Well, for starters,
you shove him into a mailbag.

07:12.762 --> 07:14.055
God, that was funny.

07:14.222 --> 07:16.975
Do you remember
the expression on his face?

07:17.142 --> 07:22.188
Oh, no, I never saw his expression.
I was too busy looking at Mr. Clavin.

07:29.028 --> 07:30.613
Woody,
let me get you another cold one.

07:30.780 --> 07:32.615
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh, gosh, I tell you,

07:32.782 --> 07:34.701
this has just been the best evening.

07:34.867 --> 07:35.994
My God,

07:36.160 --> 07:39.038
it's like reliving all my old days
at Cheers, only without Lilith.

07:39.205 --> 07:42.875
Boy, that's a trip to Bountiful,
let me tell you.

07:43.418 --> 07:45.795
These guys are really going
through the beers, aren't they?

07:45.962 --> 07:48.464
Oh, yes. If this keeps up,
you may have to fish out

07:48.631 --> 07:51.217
that emergency can
you keep in the toilet tank.

07:51.676 --> 07:53.302
Here you are, Woods.

07:53.845 --> 07:54.971
Oh, well, you know what?

07:55.138 --> 07:57.223
On second thought,
I think I'm gonna pass.

07:57.390 --> 07:59.350
I'm feeling a little bit jet-lagged.

07:59.517 --> 08:02.019
- All right, you wanna call it a night?
- I probably should.

08:02.186 --> 08:05.398
But this was so much fun.
I'd really like to do it again.

08:05.565 --> 08:07.233
All right.
Well, how about lunch tomorrow?

08:07.400 --> 08:09.360
- Oh, yeah, that sounds great.
- Okay.

08:09.527 --> 08:12.530
- Hey, goodbye, y'all. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too. Come back.

08:12.697 --> 08:15.366
You know, Woody, there's
a new gourmet Mexican restaurant

08:15.533 --> 08:17.243
down near your hotel I'd love to try.

08:17.410 --> 08:20.371
<i>It's called Dos Burros.
It sounds muy delicioso.</i>

08:20.538 --> 08:22.540
- I didn't know you speak Spanish.
- Oh, well...

08:22.707 --> 08:25.626
<i>I know that dos means "two."
What's burro mean?</i>

08:25.793 --> 08:28.170
Oh, same as in English. Jackass.

08:28.337 --> 08:30.714
Sorry, just asking.

08:38.304 --> 08:40.265
- Hey, guys, how was lunch?
- Oh, great.

08:40.432 --> 08:43.184
If we told one old story,
we told a hundred.

08:43.852 --> 08:46.522
- Hey, how are you doing, little guy?
- His name's Eddie.

08:46.689 --> 08:49.608
Oh, Eddie. Good for you, Mr. Crane.

08:49.775 --> 08:52.611
They have good days
and they have bad days.

08:53.320 --> 08:57.783
Woody, here's that Seattle guidebook
I was telling you about. Right here.

08:57.950 --> 09:00.411
- Oh, thanks.
- Get a load of that, huh?

09:02.162 --> 09:06.750
Wow, look at that view.
You can see the whole city.

09:06.917 --> 09:09.169
When you turn around
it's even better.

09:12.047 --> 09:14.508
Oh, yeah, you're right. This is better.

09:14.675 --> 09:16.468
No, no, no.
Look and see there...

09:18.387 --> 09:22.432
- Hey, yeah, you mind if I go out there?
- No, no, you go ahead.

09:22.599 --> 09:23.684
Hey, you remember that time

09:23.850 --> 09:26.520
we went out on the balcony
at Melville's and threw pudding?

09:27.229 --> 09:31.191
I don't think I ever laughed harder
in my entire life.

09:33.568 --> 09:37.030
- Put a bullet in my head.
- What's going on?

09:37.197 --> 09:41.118
God, I have absolutely
nothing in common with this man

09:41.284 --> 09:43.495
except things
that happened 10 years ago.

09:43.662 --> 09:45.247
I thought you had
a fun time last night.

09:45.413 --> 09:47.666
Well, yes. We had exactly
the same time this afternoon,

09:47.833 --> 09:49.000
and it wasn't nearly as fun.

09:49.167 --> 09:51.795
The same stories
and variations thereof.

09:51.962 --> 09:55.215
Being forced to laugh over and over.

09:55.382 --> 09:57.592
I swear, if I never get
another shoulder noogie

09:57.759 --> 10:01.263
- I will die a happy man.
- Oh, don't feel bad.

10:01.429 --> 10:03.598
You've been a good friend,
you showed him a nice time,

10:03.765 --> 10:07.185
and now all that's left is for you
to go in there and tell him goodbye.

10:07.352 --> 10:08.770
Yes, I guess when all this is over

10:08.937 --> 10:11.606
I will have learned
a very valuable lesson.

10:12.065 --> 10:14.818
Sometimes, you can have too much
of a good thing.

10:14.984 --> 10:17.278
Got to know when to say when.

10:17.445 --> 10:19.072
The past is just that, the past.

10:19.239 --> 10:22.325
You can never go home again.
Less is more.

10:22.492 --> 10:24.953
Wish you would have started
with that last one.

10:28.748 --> 10:31.042
Well, Woods, huh?

10:31.209 --> 10:32.835
It's been great seeing you.

10:33.378 --> 10:35.463
- Oh, yeah, hey...
- Come on, give me...

10:35.630 --> 10:38.049
Give me a good hug, huh?

10:38.967 --> 10:41.886
You gotta promise me you'll give
my love to everybody back at the bar.

10:42.053 --> 10:43.429
- Oh, I will.
- Okay.

10:43.596 --> 10:45.306
And give that beautiful wife of yours

10:45.473 --> 10:47.475
and those two kids a big kiss
from Uncle Frasier.

10:47.642 --> 10:50.645
- You got it.
- And don't be a stranger, okay?

10:50.812 --> 10:52.980
No, I won't. I won't.

10:54.899 --> 10:58.402
So where are we going
for dinner tonight?

11:04.617 --> 11:07.411
- Niles.
- Oh, Frasier.

11:07.578 --> 11:11.165
Odd to see you without Woody in tow.
Is he off teasing ferrets?

11:11.332 --> 11:14.627
Niles, listen, I've been having
such a great time with Woody,

11:14.794 --> 11:16.879
I was hoping,
maybe tonight you'd like to join us.

11:17.046 --> 11:18.631
- We plan to go out...
- You can save it.

11:18.798 --> 11:21.133
Dad brought me up to speed
on your reunion of the damned.

11:21.300 --> 11:22.843
- Oh, God.
- I would love to help.

11:23.010 --> 11:26.263
- I'm sorry, you're on your own.
- No, no, please. Really, I'm desperate.

11:26.430 --> 11:28.766
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is to feign interest

11:28.933 --> 11:30.810
in the same old stories
over and over again?

11:30.976 --> 11:32.561
And you call yourself a psychiatrist?

11:32.728 --> 11:34.563
You wouldn't last a week
in private practice.

11:35.439 --> 11:37.358
Speaking of which,
my 6:00 is waiting.

11:37.525 --> 11:39.360
- Triple espresso to go.
- Thank you.

11:39.527 --> 11:42.238
Niles, please. Please, I need you.

11:42.404 --> 11:44.990
It's gonna be
an excruciating journey into...

11:45.157 --> 11:47.243
Oh, God... Roz.

11:47.409 --> 11:49.828
Say, you know, are you up
for a night on the town?

11:49.995 --> 11:52.581
This wouldn't be the invitation
Niles just blew off, would it?

11:52.748 --> 11:54.917
Oh, all right. Here. Please.

11:55.084 --> 11:57.169
My old friend Woody's
dragging me out again tonight.

11:57.336 --> 11:59.004
I could really use a buffer.

11:59.171 --> 12:02.341
He's taking me
to some God-awful karaoke bar.

12:02.508 --> 12:03.676
- Are you gonna sing?
- No.

12:03.842 --> 12:05.511
- Okay, I'll go.
- Really? You will?

12:05.677 --> 12:07.763
I have a babysitter tonight.
My plans fell through.

12:07.930 --> 12:11.809
- Karaoke might be fun.
- Karaoke, tonight? Oh, I'd love to.

12:11.975 --> 12:14.144
Well, Gil,
I'm not sure you'd enjoy this...

12:14.311 --> 12:17.105
Nonsense. If we go to the one on Pike,
I keep a locker there

12:17.272 --> 12:20.067
where I store my own microphone
and show jackets.

12:21.693 --> 12:23.987
- Hey, guys. Hi, Roz.
- Oh, hi, Noel.

12:24.154 --> 12:26.698
I see you're at our table.

12:27.115 --> 12:28.492
"Our table"?

12:28.659 --> 12:30.369
Oh, is there
an office romance brewing?

12:30.535 --> 12:33.789
No, Gil, we're just friends.
Right, Noel?

12:33.956 --> 12:36.083
So far.

12:36.249 --> 12:38.210
Well, who knows
what the night has in store.

12:38.377 --> 12:40.420
We're all going for karaoke.
Why don't you join us?

12:40.587 --> 12:43.006
- Count me in.
- Is that my beeper?

12:43.173 --> 12:44.800
- I didn't hear anything.
- It's the babysitter.

12:44.966 --> 12:46.635
She calls in an emergency.
Gotta go, bye.

12:46.802 --> 12:47.844
- Roz...
- Taxi!

12:48.011 --> 12:51.473
- Roz, wait!
- Roz, wait!

12:51.890 --> 12:55.018
Well, looks like it's just us boys.

13:03.985 --> 13:07.155
- Oh, that was beautiful.
- Yeah.

13:07.322 --> 13:08.990
You know, Niles,
that was the first movie

13:09.157 --> 13:10.450
I ever took your mother to see.

13:10.617 --> 13:13.703
I deliberately picked a tear-jerker
so I'd be there to comfort her.

13:13.870 --> 13:17.082
At the first sniffle
I was on her like an octopus.

13:17.666 --> 13:18.708
You men.

13:18.875 --> 13:21.211
You always find a way
to make us more vulnerable

13:21.378 --> 13:23.755
to your clumsy advances.

13:23.922 --> 13:27.300
Oh, that wine
went straight to my head.

13:27.467 --> 13:30.011
Let's just kill off the bottle, shall we?

13:34.015 --> 13:35.517
Hey, Fras.

13:36.518 --> 13:39.103
- Turn off the music.
- Oh, well, we were just...

13:39.270 --> 13:42.774
Dad,
I never wanna hear music again.

13:44.192 --> 13:48.279
Oh, I take it you had a whiz-bang time
at the karaoke bar?

13:49.155 --> 13:50.907
For starters,

13:51.366 --> 13:54.577
Woody sang
"What Kind of Fool Am I?"

13:55.745 --> 13:59.457
Which quickly turned
into an audience-participation number.

14:00.750 --> 14:06.297
Then Gil and Noel
did a charming duet

14:06.464 --> 14:09.383
of "Anything You Can Do
I Can Do Better."

14:09.884 --> 14:11.928
They were both wrong.

14:16.557 --> 14:19.560
I guess the highlight of the evening
was when Gil,

14:19.727 --> 14:22.855
after one too many Kir Royales,

14:23.814 --> 14:27.818
performed a haunting rendition
of "I Feel Pretty,"

14:30.738 --> 14:32.990
during the latter verses of which
Noel joined him

14:33.157 --> 14:37.912
on the apron of the stage
and translated into Klingon.

14:43.709 --> 14:46.170
Well, I think I'm just
gonna go off to bed

14:46.337 --> 14:49.381
so I can get up bright and early for my
harbour cruise with Woody tomorrow.

14:49.548 --> 14:50.883
What? You're seeing him again?

14:51.050 --> 14:53.219
Why don't you just tell the guy
you're busy for once?

14:53.385 --> 14:55.930
But, Dad, he knows that I'm not.

14:56.764 --> 14:59.892
Besides, I'd hate to hurt his feelings.

15:00.059 --> 15:02.186
I'd hate to have him think
that I've outgrown him.

15:02.353 --> 15:04.396
- But you have.
- Well, that's the problem.

15:04.563 --> 15:06.774
I've moved on to bigger
and better things in my life.

15:06.940 --> 15:07.983
He's still pouring drinks

15:08.150 --> 15:11.612
back at the same bar
he's been at for the last 15 years.

15:11.779 --> 15:15.074
- Don't you think that's kind of sad?
- If I were you, I'd just lie to him.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.284
Tell him you have to work
or you met a pretty girl.

15:17.451 --> 15:19.578
<i>Who's that pretty girl
In the mirror there?</i>

15:19.745 --> 15:23.165
<i>What mirror, where?
Who could that attractive girl be?</i>

15:23.332 --> 15:25.667
<i>Which, what, where, whom? Who?</i>

15:25.834 --> 15:27.336
<i>- Daphne. Daphne.
- Who?</i>

15:27.503 --> 15:28.879
Daphne!

15:30.422 --> 15:31.506
Bedtime.

15:31.673 --> 15:33.800
I used to be
with the Light Opera Works.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.261
Yes, fine.
And I used to be a fan dancer.

15:36.428 --> 15:38.263
Get out. Go to bed.

15:40.390 --> 15:41.683
She seems a little wobbly.

15:41.850 --> 15:43.727
- Perhaps I should...
- Niles.

15:50.692 --> 15:53.070
Oh, surprise. Guess who?

15:53.236 --> 15:56.281
Dear God. I just left him.

15:56.865 --> 16:01.077
What moonlit, berry-picking expedition
does he have planned for me now?

16:02.704 --> 16:05.207
I can't take this anymore.
All right, all right, fine.

16:05.373 --> 16:08.043
I'm just gonna have to lie to him.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.921
- Woody.
- Hey, Dr. Crane.

16:11.087 --> 16:12.130
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi.

16:12.297 --> 16:16.259
Listen, l... When I got back to my hotel,
I called Kelly to say good night

16:16.426 --> 16:20.138
and turns out our little girl
has an ear infection,

16:20.305 --> 16:22.182
so I'm taking the redeye right now,

16:22.349 --> 16:24.225
and my cab is waiting for me
downstairs.

16:24.392 --> 16:27.062
Oh, well, Woody,
I guess this means goodbye then.

16:27.228 --> 16:30.440
- Yeah, I'm afraid so.
- Well, all right. Give me a hug.

16:30.607 --> 16:32.817
Remember to give my love
to the folks back at Cheers.

16:32.984 --> 16:34.027
- Oh, will do.
- Okay.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.404
I hope that little girl of yours
gets better real soon.

16:36.571 --> 16:38.448
Thank you.
It was great spending time with you.

16:38.615 --> 16:40.450
- It was great seeing you too, Woody.
- Yeah.

16:40.617 --> 16:43.411
- It's a shame we have to cut it short.
- It sure is. Goodbye.

16:43.578 --> 16:45.747
- Have a good trip.
- Take care. Bye-bye.

16:45.914 --> 16:47.874
Good night, Woods.

16:50.793 --> 16:54.964
God bless the virus
that invaded that little girl's ear canal.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.074

17:03.306 --> 17:05.849
- Congratulations. I'll be off.
- Oh, no, no, Niles.

17:06.017 --> 17:08.019
Tell you what.
To celebrate my new-found freedom,

17:08.185 --> 17:10.354
we go over to that little cantina
I mentioned earlier,

17:10.521 --> 17:11.772
and I'll buy you a late supper.

17:11.939 --> 17:15.233
- We'll have a margarita.
- Oh, well, thank you, Frasier.

17:15.401 --> 17:18.279
And after that, we'll go by
that pricey new cigar club. It's my treat.

17:18.863 --> 17:20.615
Well, hey, big spender.

17:23.659 --> 17:25.286
Is everything all right?

17:26.662 --> 17:30.958
The last time I heard that phrase,
Gil was belting it out

17:31.125 --> 17:34.545
while sitting on the lap
of a Japanese businessman.

17:36.297 --> 17:38.299
Let's get that margarita.

17:42.261 --> 17:44.346
- Thank you.
- I think you're gonna like this place.

17:44.513 --> 17:46.682
Well, I do already. N.M.B.

17:46.849 --> 17:49.935
- N.M. B?
- No mariachi band.

17:53.355 --> 17:55.232
Dear God. Quick.
Hide your face with your menu.

17:55.399 --> 17:57.651
- What...?
- Woody's over there.

17:57.818 --> 17:59.278
If he sees us, he'll know I lied.

17:59.445 --> 18:02.156
- When did you lie?
- I told him I was going out of town.

18:02.323 --> 18:04.783
No, you didn't. He told you
he was going out of town.

18:05.868 --> 18:07.286
That's right.

18:07.453 --> 18:10.664
He lied. He should be hiding. Woody.

18:10.831 --> 18:12.541
Woody.

18:17.838 --> 18:21.383
For God's sake. Stay here.

18:28.348 --> 18:30.434
Woody, come out of there, please.

18:35.230 --> 18:37.024
I don't understand this.

18:37.190 --> 18:39.818
It means, "I don't speak English."

18:40.485 --> 18:42.446
Would you just come out here?

18:43.780 --> 18:47.242
Woody, what is going on?

18:47.409 --> 18:49.745
I can't even look at you,
I'm so ashamed.

18:49.911 --> 18:52.664
- I lied to you, Dr. Crane.
- Why did you do that?

18:52.831 --> 18:56.626
Well, I guess I didn't want you to know
it was me in the bathroom.

18:58.336 --> 19:00.130
No, Woody.

19:00.297 --> 19:04.259
Earlier this evening, you told me
that you were going back to Boston.

19:04.426 --> 19:09.181
Oh, well, I feel terrible saying this,

19:09.347 --> 19:13.226
but I just couldn't face another day
of us hanging out together.

19:13.393 --> 19:15.478
What, you weren't enjoying
our time together?

19:15.645 --> 19:18.982
Oh, you know,
I had a great time that first night,

19:19.149 --> 19:22.402
but after that, I don't know,
you were still having a good time,

19:22.569 --> 19:26.823
but it was less and less fun for me.

19:30.118 --> 19:32.245
It's just too funny.

19:32.662 --> 19:36.207
See, you're still having a good time
and I'm miserable.

19:36.374 --> 19:38.084
Why didn't you say something?

19:38.251 --> 19:41.713
Well, I don't know.
I didn't wanna hurt your feelings.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.798
To tell you the truth, I was...

19:43.965 --> 19:45.967
I felt kind of bad for you.

19:46.467 --> 19:47.927
You felt bad for me?

19:48.094 --> 19:50.263
Well, no offence,
but look at your life.

19:50.430 --> 19:54.267
You live with your dad,
you hang out with your brother.

19:56.144 --> 19:58.771
You have no plans and...

19:58.938 --> 20:01.149
Let's face it,
those karaoke friends of yours,

20:01.316 --> 20:04.152
I wouldn't want to be stranded
on a desert island with them.

20:04.819 --> 20:10.324
Oh, well, maybe that English guy.
He was a good entertainer.

20:10.491 --> 20:13.578
Really, Woody,
there's nothing to worry about.

20:13.745 --> 20:16.289
I know my life may seem
rather dreary to you,

20:16.456 --> 20:18.916
but it's really quite enjoyable.

20:19.083 --> 20:21.669
In fact, it's even a lot of fun.

20:22.128 --> 20:25.006
I love my life now.
Honestly. You know what?

20:25.173 --> 20:27.717
I wouldn't trade my years at Cheers
for anything,

20:27.884 --> 20:31.846
but I am very happy with my life
the way it is today.

20:32.263 --> 20:34.432
- You mean it?
- Yes.

20:34.599 --> 20:36.684
That's what makes this conversation
so ironic.

20:36.851 --> 20:40.521
You see, you see my life as some sort
of middle-age compromise

20:41.188 --> 20:44.525
and, well, just the other day
I was thinking about your life.

20:44.692 --> 20:48.362
- And all I could think was...
- What?

20:51.574 --> 20:53.075
How lucky you are.

20:53.576 --> 20:57.037
You see, you found where you belong,
and you've made your home there.

20:57.204 --> 21:00.791
I guess for some of us
it just takes longer than others.

21:02.418 --> 21:04.420
Well, I just stopped in for a beer...

21:04.587 --> 21:07.047
Well, Niles will be on the phone
for a couple more minutes.

21:07.214 --> 21:09.133
Why don't we just have
one last drink together?

21:09.300 --> 21:10.509
- Well, that'd be nice.
- Okay.

21:10.676 --> 21:13.095
Barkeep,
couple of beers here, please.

21:14.179 --> 21:17.099
You know, I meant what I said

21:17.266 --> 21:21.895
about I had a great time
hanging out with you that first night.

21:22.062 --> 21:23.939
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:24.106 --> 21:27.443
Maybe we could do it again
in five or 10 years.

21:27.609 --> 21:30.946
Absolutely. Ten years it is.

21:32.239 --> 21:33.949
Cheers.

21:34.783 --> 21:36.535
Cheers.
