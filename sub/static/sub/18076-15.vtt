NARRATOR: In 1972, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a miIitary court...

01:29.372 --> 01:30.653
for a crime they didn't commit.

01:30.748 --> 01:33.666
These men promptIy escaped
from a maximum-security stockade...

01:33.751 --> 01:35.210
to the Los AngeIes underground.

01:35.295 --> 01:38.960
Today, stiII wanted by the government,
they survive as soIdiers of fortune.

01:39.048 --> 01:41.504
If you have a probIem,
if no one eIse can heIp...

01:41.593 --> 01:45.009
and if you can find them,
maybe you can hire the A-Team.

[Suspenseful instrumental music]

[Door closing]

04:08.740 --> 04:12.405
We just picked up unauthorised use
of a computer on the security level.

04:12.494 --> 04:14.451
RAYMOND: What level?
CARSON: Red level.

04:14.537 --> 04:18.452
Full data scan, interlocking with lnterpol
and Federal satellite relays.

04:18.916 --> 04:21.538
Luckily, the station she was using
didn't shut down.

04:21.628 --> 04:24.297
-And her access code was still entered.
-Her?

04:26.966 --> 04:31.260
RAYMOND: A clerk in R&l who's been
with the firm less than one month...

04:31.346 --> 04:34.797
making unsanctioned use
of the security computer at 5:00 a.m.?

04:34.891 --> 04:39.600
Do you think she discovered our pIan
to assassinate Sheik Fatasi at 2.:00?

04:39.687 --> 04:42.143
All we have is her final search data.

04:42.232 --> 04:45.435
She was linked to the military computers
in Los Angeles.

04:45.527 --> 04:48.481
She was calling up information
on the A-Team.

04:48.571 --> 04:51.774
-They're a military unit--
-l know about them.

04:52.075 --> 04:55.859
This dangerous breach could mean
she also knows about us.

04:55.954 --> 04:59.453
-We can't be sure of that.
-Well, then let's be sure.

05:00.708 --> 05:02.203
She was out of the building...

05:02.293 --> 05:05.958
before it kicked back to security
that someone was in the computer.

05:06.089 --> 05:08.496
She must have been moving fast.

05:08.716 --> 05:11.670
Which is probably why
she left the computer on.

05:11.761 --> 05:13.553
Find her, Carson.

05:14.180 --> 05:17.051
Find her before she finds the A-Team.

05:17.183 --> 05:18.891
RAYMOND: Find her before 2.:00.

FACE: Come on, Hannibal.
Are you kidding me?

05:59.392 --> 06:01.681
Face, Decker's been crowding us.

06:01.769 --> 06:05.020
Our last two supposed clients
have been military plants.

06:05.106 --> 06:08.143
l was lucky to spot them
before they figured out l was Mr. Lee.

06:08.234 --> 06:10.393
Stop complaining.
You love all that greasepaint.

06:10.487 --> 06:12.526
That's why you run them
through the gauntlet.

06:12.614 --> 06:13.693
To weed out the bad ones.

06:13.782 --> 06:16.355
The odds are
one will slip through eventually.

06:16.451 --> 06:18.657
We got to get out of town.

06:18.870 --> 06:21.954
Yes, but out of the country? No, not now.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.329
l got a real good thing on the burner here.

06:24.417 --> 06:28.746
Selling fishing poles, leaky canteens,
and darts that don't even fly straight?

06:28.838 --> 06:30.831
Try this one, Hannibal.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.715
lt just so happens...

06:34.260 --> 06:37.925
that the Contessa Marascella
and her lovely daughter Carmella...

06:38.014 --> 06:41.098
like to come shopping here
in the sporting goods department.

06:41.184 --> 06:44.185
Man, l don't know why anybody
would want to come shopping here.

06:44.270 --> 06:47.105
Especially no princess.
They don't even sell good darts.

06:47.190 --> 06:50.606
There are more important things in life, B.A.,
than throwing darts.

06:50.693 --> 06:54.276
Hannibal, now look, if l can hook up
with the Contessa, l'm taken care of.

06:54.364 --> 06:56.937
FACE: l'll be on her
grouse hunting expedition for sure.

06:57.033 --> 07:00.153
That way, l'll be out of the country
for a couple of weeks.

07:00.245 --> 07:02.652
And if Carmella's nice to me...

07:02.747 --> 07:05.285
l can parlay that into an extended leave.

07:05.375 --> 07:07.166
The longer we wait the greater the risk.

07:07.252 --> 07:08.331
My plan is...

07:08.419 --> 07:10.626
we get out of town
as soon as l finish playing...

07:10.713 --> 07:12.208
the Monster from Camp Runamuck.

07:12.298 --> 07:14.706
Now, if the Contessa
and CarmeIIa MarasceIIa...

07:14.801 --> 07:17.422
don't invite you by the time
l finish filming today...

07:17.512 --> 07:20.466
you're out of luck. We leave tonight.

07:20.557 --> 07:25.100
Come on, Face, the three of us
have had some great vacations.

07:25.186 --> 07:29.101
And we'll pick a nice place. Rio, Acapulco--

07:34.487 --> 07:36.646

salesman of the month.

07:36.739 --> 07:40.571
'Cause that's who the Contessa requests
when she comes shopping here.

07:41.202 --> 07:42.400
Sorry.

07:44.456 --> 07:46.911
HANNlBAL: Cheer up, Face.
lt's an annual event.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.700
l'm sure the Contessa and her grouse
will wait till next year.

by putting some men up front...

like that.

HANNlBAL: We don't need any more press.
Enough people know we're out there.

14:59.265 --> 15:02.100
Yeah, but we're not too sure
she's not a plant by Decker.

Now do you happen to think
if l could invest a little time...

15:05.271 --> 15:06.647
l might be able to draw her out.

15:06.731 --> 15:10.599
Oh, l see. You mean just the two of you
over a quiet cup of coffee...

15:10.693 --> 15:13.149
you could find something out about her?

15:39.139 --> 15:40.218
On the team.

15:40.306 --> 15:45.099
On an individual basis,
we all fend for ourselves.

15:57.866 --> 15:59.194
-Anything on the girl?
-Nothing!

15:59.284 --> 16:03.233
l used the chopper to crisscross the city
and see if l could pick her up. No luck.

16:03.329 --> 16:05.037
l'm heading over to her apartment now.

16:05.123 --> 16:07.910

or come into work in a few hours.

by 1 200 hours...

17:17.112 --> 17:19.151
So my friend who was working
at lntermode...

17:19.239 --> 17:21.990
thought it might make some kind of story.

17:22.075 --> 17:26.203
Didn't you think maybe she was just bitter
because lntermode laid her off?

17:26.287 --> 17:28.529
TAWNlA: Sure, l knew that was some of it.

about the entire upper management...

slowly being replaced
over a couple of months' time...

17:34.254 --> 17:37.041

cutting off access to certain areas
that had been open until then...

17:41.136 --> 17:44.967
it was enough to convince my editor
to let me check it out.

17:45.056 --> 17:48.555
What was going on in one of the largest
private security firms in L.A.?

17:48.643 --> 17:52.308

just wanted to get in touch with us?

17:52.856 --> 17:53.887
No.

But once l was there, l realised
the full potential of their computer system.

17:59.821 --> 18:03.356

l could tap into military records...

18:03.450 --> 18:04.481
if they had the access.

18:04.576 --> 18:06.864
Which, with their contracts
with the government...

18:06.953 --> 18:09.788
and other international security firms,
would definitely do.

18:09.873 --> 18:11.746
l figured why not kill two birds, right?

18:11.833 --> 18:16.459
Well, l must tell you, Tawnia.
l'm very glad you did.

about fraternising
with members of the team.

-you're not a member of the team.
-Yet.

18:49.996 --> 18:53.032
