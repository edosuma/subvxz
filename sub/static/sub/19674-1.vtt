01:37.198 --> 01:40.834
Big Ben, old faithful,
and Jack Malone, 10 o'clock,

01:40.835 --> 01:43.570
and a bottle
of Cabernet: like clockwork.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.738
- Cut it Sam, I'm working here.
- Yeah, sure you are.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.407
You're working
your way through that bottle.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.207
That's fancy French stuff.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.710
That costs a pretty penny.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.712
You're not holding out
on me are you?

01:52.713 --> 01:55.381
I'm not holding out,
you know I pull a bigger cut

01:55.382 --> 01:56.850
so stop busting my hump.

01:56.851 --> 01:59.718
- There's something going down
- Mhm.

02:16.604 --> 02:17.837
Alright.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.240
Ladies, lovers, and lushes,

02:20.241 --> 02:21.674
looks like you're all enjoying

02:21.675 --> 02:23.743
the hospitality
of our little club.

02:23.744 --> 02:27.614
Now remember, don't tell anyone
about our secret.

02:27.615 --> 02:31.784
Ain't no booze here!
Just good clean fun.

02:31.785 --> 02:34.653
That's right.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.657
Fucking amazing,
the stones on this guy.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.260
Come on, not even the probies

02:40.261 --> 02:42.529
give a cobbler's crap
about prohibition anymore.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.264
It's going to be
repealed any day now.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.431
Shut up.

02:45.432 --> 02:51.237
And now, for all you good
god-fearing people out there,

02:51.238 --> 02:54.272
I have the true queen
of the night.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.676
Alexandra Diamond.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.927
Whoa! Now I know
why you were late.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.597
Good god, I mean look at that.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.300
That is a vision.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.905
Good god in heaven,
lord, have mercy on us all.

03:25.906 --> 03:29.741
I mean... Jesus.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.511
Look at this...
Just look at her skin.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.479
It's like it's porcelain.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.682
Like she must have just bathe
in milk like all day long.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.951
She must just sit
in the bathtub.

03:37.952 --> 03:39.719
In full milk,
all day long and eat nothing

03:39.720 --> 03:42.322
but like lemon rinds
and raisin skins

03:42.323 --> 03:43.989
and lord knows what else.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.725
Jesus.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.866
I mean...

03:53.867 --> 03:56.147
You-you know
what I'm saying Jack?

04:02.309 --> 04:03.709
Hey, sweetheart!

04:06.680 --> 04:09.114
- Pack of Lucky's.
- Sure, mister.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.452
Say, honey,
I want to open up a tab.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.854
Can I talk to the boss?
Is he here?

04:14.855 --> 04:17.656
Yeah, he's always here.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.659
Well, great! Where?

04:19.660 --> 04:22.929
Well, he just walked out.

04:22.930 --> 04:26.264
Walked out where?
The front door?

04:26.700 --> 04:28.434
Or that back room over there?

04:28.435 --> 04:31.938
Hey, you ask a lot of questions.
Are you a cop?

04:31.939 --> 04:33.006
Yeah.

04:33.007 --> 04:34.574
Sargent Jack Malone.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.609
This here's
my partner Sam Varning.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.478
We're South Hampton's finest,
ma'am.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.813
We live but
to protect and serve.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.915
Traffic tickets, cats in trees,

04:42.916 --> 04:45.685
pretty ladies in need of rescue
from their virginity.

04:45.686 --> 04:48.921
You're full of shit, silly.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.690
Keep the change, little lady.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.324
I'll look into opening
that tab another night.

04:53.327 --> 04:56.828
Come on, Sam.
Let's go do some police work.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.977
Ginger.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.327
I didn't know you had
Chinese in your town.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.983
I haven't had Chinese
in a while.

05:52.853 --> 05:56.054
- I may have to come visit.
- Chester, darling.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.623
That's quite enough.

05:57.624 --> 06:01.459
I'm sure Mr. Baker here is
convinced of our resolve.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.630
After all, Mr. Baker,

06:04.631 --> 06:07.832
You only have nine more fingers.

06:14.441 --> 06:16.075
Why did you want to be a cop?

06:16.076 --> 06:19.277
Because I'm handy
with a gun and needed a job.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.614
- Come on, Jack, seriously.
- Sam, we've had to brace

06:21.615 --> 06:23.416
just about
everybody in our group.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.884
I'm not in the mood.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.385
See, that's kinda
what I'm talking about.

06:28.522 --> 06:32.190
We do our thing behind closed
doors but you know...

06:32.860 --> 06:34.260
word gets around.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.129
Well, that's a good thing, no?

06:36.130 --> 06:39.665
Everybody in town knows the
score and word does travel,

06:39.666 --> 06:41.968
not just here,
but Philly, New York.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.870
Everybody knows
we handle our own business

06:43.871 --> 06:45.570
and we're not up for grabs.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.807
And how long
do you think it's going to take

06:47.808 --> 06:49.409
for someone to figure out

06:49.410 --> 06:50.910
that there's just
a handful of us.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.578
Against all the rum runners
and racketeers.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.681
Believe me, Sam.

06:55.682 --> 06:58.282
I would love for somebody
to try a move like that.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.585
That's what I'm afraid of.

07:02.856 --> 07:06.424
I find this lack of respect
quite disconcerting.

07:06.827 --> 07:11.162
To even think you can find
what we offer someplace else

07:11.165 --> 07:13.531
I told you everything I know.

07:13.667 --> 07:17.502
I swear.
You believe me, don't you?

07:17.604 --> 07:19.639
Please tell me you believe me.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.007
Believe you?

07:21.008 --> 07:23.776
Believe? Believe!

07:23.777 --> 07:26.746
I believe you're a lying blood
sucking double crosser

07:26.747 --> 07:28.948
who's so fucking greedy

07:28.949 --> 07:30.716
that you ruined
everything we built

07:30.717 --> 07:32.997
just to make a few extra bucks.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.959
What did you do that for?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.128
He was out of fingers.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.896
You just killed
any chances we had

07:43.897 --> 07:47.232
at salvaging our relationship
with his boss.

07:47.468 --> 07:48.868
Victor...

07:48.869 --> 07:52.104
I'm tired of dealing with these
nickel and dime speakeasies.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.974
The only reason
we came to this town

07:54.975 --> 07:57.609
was so we could move up
to New York City.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.012
Now, I've been around long
around enough to know

08:00.013 --> 08:03.014
when it's time
to sever old ties.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.051
And that cop was sniffing around
again tonight.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.519
I don't want to draw
any more attention

08:06.520 --> 08:07.620
than we already getting.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.220
Don't worry about him.

08:09.556 --> 08:12.423
He sticks his nose
where it doesn't belong,

08:12.860 --> 08:14.993
I'll add it to my collection.

08:28.509 --> 08:29.909
Hey!

08:31.912 --> 08:33.645
- So?
- You been waiting long?

08:33.647 --> 08:35.780
- Not long, a half hour or so.
- Half hour?

08:35.782 --> 08:37.884
You should've come inside,
I would have cut out early.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.253
- I'm here, ain't I?
- Yes you are.

08:40.254 --> 08:42.614
Come on,
I want to show you something.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.397
Willie...

08:53.200 --> 08:55.967
I made it myself from a stone
I found in the creek.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.583
It's not much
but I thought it was pretty.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.707
You don't have to wear it
if you don't want to.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.174
No, no.

09:03.277 --> 09:04.677
I love it.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.111
Put it on.

09:09.616 --> 09:11.117
You know with this new job here,

09:11.118 --> 09:13.518
I'm starting to make
some good money.

09:14.955 --> 09:17.755
Before you know it, I'll be able
to buy you real jewelry.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.425
But this is real jewelry.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.027
It's wonderful.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.064
I love it.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.366
And I love you.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.236
Rich or poor.

09:32.306 --> 09:35.173
Anna, you know that ain't
going to fly with your mom.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.589
I swear,
I'm going to marry you some day.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.213
I'm going to build you
a ritzy house

09:41.214 --> 09:43.082
with a car in the driveway,

09:43.083 --> 09:45.083
a nursery for the kiddies,

09:45.652 --> 09:46.986
Children?

09:46.987 --> 09:48.686
Slow down there jitterbug.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.056
How about a waltz?

10:00.133 --> 10:03.368
That's not a waltz.

10:03.904 --> 10:07.105
Well... How about this?

10:17.084 --> 10:18.484
That'll do.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.321
Nothing to see here.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.757
Nothing to see here either.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.178
New meat.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.780
I think he could be
a high roller.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.716
Gotta be careful
with these rich fellas.

10:50.717 --> 10:52.184
They're into all kinds of crazy.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.752
Yeah, crazy rich.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.689
You're such a whore, Rosey!

10:56.690 --> 10:58.623
The best in town.

10:58.659 --> 11:01.260
- It's a small town.
- Just go inside.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.962
Fuck off.

11:02.963 --> 11:07.832
I love you too miss
Lily Margaret Moon.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.642
Welcome to <i> Rosey's Thorns.</i>

11:18.345 --> 11:20.980
Why thank you.
Would you happen to be Rosey?

11:20.981 --> 11:22.314
Yes, I am.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.417
This is my little paradise

11:24.418 --> 11:27.452
where the girls are pretty
and the shoots are clean.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.455
I haven't seen you before.

11:29.456 --> 11:32.156
Are you new in town
or just passing through?

11:32.225 --> 11:34.459
A little of both.

11:34.695 --> 11:35.995
May I come in?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.462
Of course.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.231
Be my guest.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.454
Welcome, handsome.

12:01.455 --> 12:03.155
All guests get
their first drink free.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.825
My apologies Miss,
I don't drink spirits.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.460
Do you have some wine, perhaps?

12:07.461 --> 12:09.161
Pussy and whiskey
is all we've got.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.562
If you're looking
for a glass of wine,

12:12.199 --> 12:13.498
you best get yourself to church.

12:13.499 --> 12:14.934
- I don't do well in church.
- Don't mind her.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.936
We got a half bottle
back in the pantry.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.271
Is that alright with you,
Miss Rosey?

12:19.272 --> 12:22.074
Why yes, Miss Lily,

12:22.075 --> 12:24.143
you go on ahead
and I'll introduce

12:24.144 --> 12:26.345
- the girls to Mr...
- Washington.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.813
George Washington.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.782
Yes.

12:29.783 --> 12:33.185
Well, Mr. Lincoln,
Jackson, and Franklin

12:33.186 --> 12:35.020
are customers also.

12:35.021 --> 12:38.923
Well, these presidents
ought to get us started.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.860
I can go all night.

12:43.497 --> 12:47.565
Well, Mr. Washington,

12:47.868 --> 12:52.338
I'd like to formally welcome you
to my little garden paradise.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.473
I'm Rosey, you've met Lily,

12:54.474 --> 12:58.077
this is Jasmine,
Daisy, and Violet.

12:58.078 --> 13:01.147
Such clever names.
A regular bouquet.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.849
It's a lot more appealing
than Margaret or Prudence.

13:03.850 --> 13:05.384
Or Eleanor or Clare.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.119
Well my mother's name way Clare.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.753
Would you fuck her?

13:08.955 --> 13:10.790
- Good point.
- Here you go.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.925
I hope you like it.
It's from Rosey's private stock.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.193
It's okay.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.826
He can afford it.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.576
Why thank you,
that's much better.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.232
So, Mr. President,

13:20.233 --> 13:22.553
are you ready
for your initiation?

13:22.969 --> 13:24.835
Don't you mean inauguration?

13:24.938 --> 13:27.072
A president gets inaugurated.

13:27.073 --> 13:30.341
Inaugurate,
initiate, intimidate.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.511
I do it all.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.480
She'll do.

13:49.462 --> 13:52.198
Look what the cat dragged in.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.033
I was wondering when you'd show.

13:54.034 --> 13:57.102
All things come
to she who waits.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.803
It's 2 a.m.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.507
Then it's early, no?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.507
What are you, a lawyer now?

14:03.877 --> 14:05.509
Details.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.279
Who's the Rockefeller?

14:08.515 --> 14:10.282
I don't recognize the car.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.803
Now, don't go shaking down
my customers too.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.520
Don't worry Rosey,
we are off duty

14:14.521 --> 14:16.422
and Jack here
is already half plastered.

14:16.423 --> 14:19.023
Half!

14:20.327 --> 14:22.727
Gonna have to do something
about that.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.736
Hey, doll face.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.819
You got time
for a public servant?

14:35.542 --> 14:38.110
I don't know, copper.
I'm a busy gal.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.011
My dance card's pretty full.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.547
Aw, that's a shame.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.348
Because Lily's are
my favorite flower.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.454
I have an opening after all.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.277
You know your boy Sam

15:11.278 --> 15:13.545
is becoming a regular fixture
around here.

15:13.546 --> 15:16.148
Is he any different
from me when I was young?

15:16.149 --> 15:17.650
You remember!

15:17.651 --> 15:19.385
I'm impressed.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.520
Thought all that booze rotted
your memory.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.489
Only the bad memories.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.125
- I thought they were all bad.
- No.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.060
Not the old days.

15:28.061 --> 15:32.029
I even remember when you used to
call me "dusk till dawn".

15:33.066 --> 15:34.199
Yep.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.800
"Dusk till dawn".

15:37.270 --> 15:39.537
You paid for half this place.

15:39.673 --> 15:42.973
Who needs a mortgage
when you have a horny Irish boy.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.109
Those were the days.

16:49.642 --> 16:53.144
I sense notes of almond,
something fruity.

16:53.747 --> 16:56.248
Apples, no, no, pear.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.517
Shouldn't we just taste it?

16:58.518 --> 17:01.420
The aroma is just as important
as the taste.

17:01.421 --> 17:02.621
If not, more so.

17:02.622 --> 17:06.490
It creates an anticipation
for what will follow.

17:06.492 --> 17:09.762
So it's an art. Just like music.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.829
It's what keeps me going.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.334
Tempting.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.834
Tempting it is.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.603
But this is just the beginning.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.680
What's the worse
that can happen?

17:28.681 --> 17:30.649
I end up in a whore house?

17:30.650 --> 17:32.384
Don't make this about me,
this is about you running off

17:32.385 --> 17:33.419
with that boy
in the middle of the night.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.120
Willy's not some boy

17:35.121 --> 17:36.321
and if you just listen to me
once in a while,

17:36.322 --> 17:38.123
you'd know that.

17:38.124 --> 17:39.158
You don't go running off
in the middle of the night

17:39.159 --> 17:40.826
without telling me.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.727
Don't walk out on me.
We are not finished here, Anna!

17:44.497 --> 17:45.897
Coffee?

17:47.133 --> 17:48.734
Get back in here right now!

17:48.735 --> 17:50.335
Why?
So you can give me the whole

17:50.336 --> 17:52.271
"boys are only
after one thing" speech?

17:52.272 --> 17:53.772
Well, it's true!

17:53.773 --> 17:55.707
Willie's not like that,
we love each other.

17:55.708 --> 17:59.043
He's the one,
you just hate all men.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.813
I just want what's best for you.

18:00.814 --> 18:02.848
Like what? Joining a convent?

18:02.849 --> 18:04.249
Is that it?

18:04.617 --> 18:06.217
I'm 17.

18:07.353 --> 18:09.254
I'm not as innocent
as you thing.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.722
That's what worries me.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.558
You have your whole
life ahead of you.

18:12.559 --> 18:13.826
I don't want to see you make
the same mistake I made.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.260
You mean me?

18:15.261 --> 18:16.562
Just say it again.

18:16.563 --> 18:20.432
Getting pregnant with me was the
biggest mistake of your life.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.401
Well, I'm sorry
but I'm nothing like you.

18:22.402 --> 18:25.269
God, honey,
that is not what I meant at all.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.104
You're my baby.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.139
It's just that, well...

18:29.609 --> 18:32.109
Willy is a good boy.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.180
You're both just so young still.

18:35.181 --> 18:36.914
But I love him, mama.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.186
It's okay.

18:42.188 --> 18:43.988
Look, I'm sorry.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.824
Love is a good thing.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.560
It's all we really have.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.764
Come have some breakfast.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.868
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

18:58.505 --> 18:59.970
Here, take mine.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.582
And Winegard's delivery truck

19:10.583 --> 19:13.264
was blocking the entrance
to the fire station, again.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.888
That's the third time I've had
the fire chief up my ass.

19:15.889 --> 19:18.190
That old fire chief don't bring
beer.

19:18.191 --> 19:20.392
I mean, if that crowd keep
brining cold beer with his ice,

19:20.393 --> 19:22.394
I don't have problems with his
parking habits. Right fellas?

19:22.395 --> 19:24.730
Officer Danoff,
alcohol is illegal.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.532
- You know that.
- Yeah, well...

19:26.533 --> 19:29.168
Tell you what, why don't
you do the morning briefing.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.670
How about I tell Winegard to
stop blocking the fire station.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.237
Too late.

19:35.708 --> 19:39.678
Monday, we had a report
from the widow McFadden...

19:39.679 --> 19:41.813
We had the Canadians
in town last night.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.181
You finally get your way.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.617
That new dress.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.098
It wasn't for my wife.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.954
To each his own. I don't judge.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.290
Leave morality to the fools
and martyrs.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.223
Neither of which am I.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.626
And no one could
ever accuse you of that, Jack.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.728
Malone, keep it down back there.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.363
What about Sam? He was talking.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.598
But you're the one
with a big mouth.

19:59.599 --> 20:00.766
Touché.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.100
Both of you, in my office, now!

20:05.205 --> 20:08.906
Should I stop or...
No, no! Great work, Danoff.

20:15.481 --> 20:17.615
Ok.

20:18.585 --> 20:22.621
So, I see it's payday
in beautiful South Hampton.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.723
How are things
in the hinterlands?

20:24.724 --> 20:26.425
Are the natives
getting restless?

20:26.426 --> 20:27.826
Some always squeak,

20:27.827 --> 20:29.528
but everybody's paying
the freight.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.963
The Haze boys
are starting to get hanky

20:30.964 --> 20:32.664
but that's to be expected.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.766
Anyway, they paid.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.167
Well what's going
on at that new place?

20:37.237 --> 20:38.737
- Custer's...
- Chesterfield's.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.638
That's the one.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.307
They got
a little sloppy last night

20:42.308 --> 20:43.442
and I figured out their game.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.342
At least, I think so.

20:45.411 --> 20:48.313
The front man running the place
is some nancy boy named Victor.

20:48.314 --> 20:51.817
But everything I saw points
to this band leader, Chester.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.552
Everybody counts house to him.

20:53.553 --> 20:56.355
- A band leader?
- And a colored on at that.

20:56.356 --> 20:59.691
Shit, what's this world
coming to?

20:59.692 --> 21:01.460
Hey, cap', it's 1933.

21:01.461 --> 21:04.363
I mean this is Jersey.
We're not in Mississippi.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.597
We got whites hanging out
with coloreds

21:05.598 --> 21:07.032
all over the place now.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.767
Plus, we've got pollocks,
we got spicks,

21:08.768 --> 21:10.636
we got chinks, we got mixed.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.638
Yeah,
it's a regular melting pot.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.006
We get it.

21:14.007 --> 21:15.841
Chief, with all
the comings and goings,

21:15.842 --> 21:17.776
I think this club
is a lot bigger than it looks.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.279
Chinks too? In our town?

21:20.280 --> 21:22.314
Not exactly chinks,
I just use them as an example.

21:22.315 --> 21:23.448
I was being literatival.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.015
Chief!

21:25.051 --> 21:26.850
Hold your horses.

21:30.556 --> 21:32.057
"Literatival"?

21:32.058 --> 21:33.725
That's not a word.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.359
Yes it is,
it's the plural form of literal.

21:35.428 --> 21:36.628
Use it in a sentence.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.731
I was just being "literatival"
with the captain.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.132
You're an idiot.

21:41.367 --> 21:43.801
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

21:44.125 --> 22:03.225
<b>WwW.ZooCine.CoM
Watch Movies and Series!</b>

22:07.393 --> 22:08.794
You the one who found the body?

22:08.795 --> 22:13.197
Yep, I was tracking a 6-point
buck when I came across her.

22:13.399 --> 22:14.866
- Her body.
- Where is she?

22:14.867 --> 22:17.307
Just up there,
your men are almost at her.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.904
Yep, they found her.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.347
You sure this wasn't
a hunting accident?

22:23.443 --> 22:25.544
You can save yourself a lot of
grief if you just 'fess up now.

22:25.545 --> 22:28.345
No, I told you,
it was some kind of animal.

22:28.381 --> 22:31.783
Or you had a little too much
moonshine hunting buck,

22:31.784 --> 22:34.920
saw something through the trees,
took the wrong shot...

22:34.921 --> 22:37.888
I'll swear on the Holy Bible.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.991
We'll see about that.

22:39.992 --> 22:43.128
What the hell was a girl doing
in the woods in the first place?

22:43.129 --> 22:44.996
There's trails all through
these woods.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.932
If she ain't got a car,
it's the fastest way on food.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.400
Like I said,

22:48.401 --> 22:50.535
you sure there isn't something
you want to tell me?

22:50.536 --> 22:55.773
You go take a look at her and
then call me a liar.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.254
Hey, Jack!

23:43.890 --> 23:45.556
What's the matter?

23:47.493 --> 23:48.893
Did you get him?

23:51.798 --> 23:52.998
Don't!

23:52.999 --> 23:54.565
Get down!

24:26.466 --> 24:28.900
He was out last night,
cattin' around.

24:28.901 --> 24:31.736
Seems like her family's farm was
just over that hill.

24:31.737 --> 24:33.937
Her brother's just confirmed.

24:34.941 --> 24:36.508
Aw crap.

24:36.509 --> 24:38.143
- Is it true? Let me see her!
- No, no!

24:38.144 --> 24:40.310
No, Ned, it's not a good idea.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.519
Lola?

24:49.789 --> 24:55.158
No, Lola! God, no!

24:57.096 --> 25:00.165
Shame with whom the king
had committed fornication.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.200
And with whom
the inhabitants of the earth

25:02.201 --> 25:05.704
have been made drunk
with the wine of fornication.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.539
What the hell.

25:07.540 --> 25:10.075
With a golden cup in her hand,

25:10.076 --> 25:14.713
filled with abomination
and the filthiness of her sins,

25:14.714 --> 25:15.881
and upon her...

25:15.882 --> 25:17.916
Alright preacher, that's enough.

25:17.917 --> 25:21.652
Lies the mother of harlots
and abominations of the earth!

25:21.687 --> 25:23.855
- Gun!
- Hands in the air!

25:23.856 --> 25:25.557
- Saying what you mean.
- Keep 'em up!

25:25.558 --> 25:27.292
Watch him.

25:27.293 --> 25:31.528
I will show unto you the
judgement of the great whore!

25:31.631 --> 25:33.632
He did it! He killed her.

25:33.633 --> 25:34.866
I'm going to kill him.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.668
Whoa! Calm down.

25:36.669 --> 25:39.671
Death to the whore who sleeps
with the devil.

25:39.672 --> 25:42.172
Get that nutbag the hell out
of here.

25:51.918 --> 25:54.019
Violet, I was wondering
where you were hiding.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.854
Piss off, I'm not hiding.

25:55.855 --> 25:57.756
Well, it's washday and you know
how grumpy mama gets

25:57.757 --> 25:59.824
when she sees
you gals lazing around.

25:59.825 --> 26:01.893
She made plenty of green off
my back last night.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.162
She has no reason to be upset.

26:04.163 --> 26:07.065
God dammit!
What did you do that for?

26:07.066 --> 26:09.601
It's the middle of the afternoon
for Pete's sake.

26:09.602 --> 26:10.869
Rise and shine.

26:10.870 --> 26:13.003
You little bitch.

26:17.343 --> 26:19.576
No need to be sore, Vi'.

26:20.046 --> 26:22.113
Man, what's with
this place today?

26:22.114 --> 26:23.715
Everybody's so tight.

26:23.716 --> 26:24.983
You're mom's hounding me.
Now you and V.

26:24.984 --> 26:27.218
- Give me your shirt.
- What?

26:27.219 --> 26:28.787
You want me to wash it
or you want to go

26:28.788 --> 26:31.056
to your new job
looking like a hobo?

26:31.057 --> 26:32.457
Yes, ma'am.

26:37.797 --> 26:41.199
But, my hands are dirty so
you may have to help me.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.302
Your mind is dirty.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.071
No, ma'am, I wouldn't dare...

26:46.072 --> 26:47.839
- not until we're married.
- Mhm.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.240
You play all innocent,

26:49.241 --> 26:51.521
but I know what's
on a man's mind.

26:51.677 --> 26:54.245
I was raised
in a cathouse after all.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.580
Why you gotta act
like such a nun?

26:58.117 --> 27:01.218
Because I know
it drives you crazy.

27:01.387 --> 27:02.754
You little minx.

27:02.755 --> 27:03.788
Anna!

27:03.789 --> 27:05.190
The washtub's ready.

27:05.191 --> 27:06.925
Hurry up with the rest
of the sheets!

27:06.926 --> 27:08.692
Dang it, give me your shirt.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.777
You should proclaim
your judgement,

27:25.778 --> 27:28.178
so shall ye be judged.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.183
Hot damn.

27:33.719 --> 27:35.119
You're not kidding.

27:39.291 --> 27:42.325
That's fascinating, really.

27:42.862 --> 27:45.829
Now, you can go on all you want
about the beast

27:46.065 --> 27:49.499
and what an expert you
are on the subject of hell.

27:49.802 --> 27:53.236
But I got news for you.
Hey, stay with me.

27:53.939 --> 27:55.639
I know all about it.

27:55.841 --> 27:58.175
I spent 18 months there.

27:59.011 --> 28:03.181
Now, help yourself and talk
to me because if you don't,

28:03.182 --> 28:05.050
the only thing
I can guarantee you

28:05.051 --> 28:07.551
is a one way trip to the chair.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.253
So...

28:11.891 --> 28:15.126
What were you doing
in the woods...

28:15.127 --> 28:17.727
- Praying.
- Praying for what?

28:18.330 --> 28:20.932
- Forgiveness?
- Salvation, for the whore.

28:20.933 --> 28:23.500
That she might
not be cast into perdition.

28:25.838 --> 28:28.073
Jesus, Jack, can't you see he's
off his rocker?

28:28.074 --> 28:29.040
That whore?

28:29.041 --> 28:30.408
Lola Hayes?

28:30.409 --> 28:32.609
She was just a party girl.

28:32.845 --> 28:35.080
You sick little twitch.

28:35.081 --> 28:39.084
She was an agent of beast
hunted down by wolves.

28:39.085 --> 28:42.053
Jesus, what the hell is he
talking about, Jack?

28:42.054 --> 28:44.089
But it was too late.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.057
And he knew, he knows!

28:46.058 --> 28:48.259
Enough Luther,
enough of your bullshit.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.260
Talk!

28:49.261 --> 28:50.760
Stop!

28:51.831 --> 28:53.430
Goddammit.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.168
Jack, give it a rest.

29:00.339 --> 29:01.838
Keep an eye on him.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.942
I don't want him
killing himself.

29:03.943 --> 29:05.509
I got it, Chief.

29:05.745 --> 29:09.613
I send you out as lambs
among the wolves.

29:15.821 --> 29:17.388
Did he break?

29:17.389 --> 29:20.892
Nothing but more hellfire
and a lofty sermon

29:20.893 --> 29:23.294
on the evil that is
South Hampton, the prick.

29:23.295 --> 29:26.030
Evil. He's the one
with blood on his hands.

29:26.031 --> 29:28.311
No, we still
don't have any proof.

29:29.835 --> 29:31.334
Believe me, Chief.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.138
By the time I'm done with him,

29:33.139 --> 29:35.579
he'll confess
to the Lynburg kidnapping.

29:35.808 --> 29:38.808
The Haste family's trash,
always has been.

29:39.044 --> 29:40.577
And that Lola?

29:41.847 --> 29:43.848
But nobody deserves
to die like that.

29:43.849 --> 29:46.017
Jack, I think you need
to calm down a bit.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.886
I don't need a dead suspect.

29:47.887 --> 29:49.487
That would be bad for everyone.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.055
Hey, why don't we just grab
a beer at Ruben's?

29:51.056 --> 29:52.290
I've got a better idea.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.324
Why don't you clean up,

29:53.325 --> 29:55.126
put on some civies,

29:55.127 --> 29:57.128
and shake down that new
joint you've been chasing.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.569
- Chesterfield's?
- Yeah, that's the one.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.631
Shake the money tree.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.733
My pleasure.

30:18.117 --> 30:21.418
Hey guys, we haven't opened yet.

30:22.855 --> 30:24.489
Say, aren't you that...

30:24.490 --> 30:26.890
Kid that does odd jobs
for Rosey?

30:28.394 --> 30:29.993
Willy, right?

30:30.229 --> 30:32.829
- What gives?
- That's right!

30:32.865 --> 30:35.498
A real hard worker, this one.

30:35.534 --> 30:38.503
Especially
around Rosey's daughter.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.503
A regular Romeo!

30:41.173 --> 30:42.573
Say no more.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.475
Young love.

30:44.476 --> 30:47.544
It's just such
a magical thing, isn't it?

30:47.580 --> 30:48.980
What do you want?

30:49.515 --> 30:51.348
Why don't we take it inside.

30:59.325 --> 31:01.492
Can I help you guys find a seat?

31:01.493 --> 31:02.893
No.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.527
We're not here to sit.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.431
Come on guys,
I just got this job.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.792
- Don't make me...
- Make you do what?

31:09.501 --> 31:11.468
Good evening, officers.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.838
Not every day
the cops come calling.

31:15.207 --> 31:18.875
Willy, go help Harry out
by the stage.

31:22.181 --> 31:23.381
It's a good kid.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.016
Hard worker.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.817
Much like myself
when I was younger.

31:26.952 --> 31:28.419
But I'm sure you guys

31:28.420 --> 31:30.780
didn't come here
to talk about Willie.

31:33.359 --> 31:34.958
And I'm impressed.

31:35.361 --> 31:36.394
Impressed?

31:36.395 --> 31:39.029
Yeah, with your shake down.
I mean...

31:39.031 --> 31:41.165
Most small time cops
will come up

31:41.166 --> 31:43.566
in the joint with axes,
tear it up.

31:43.903 --> 31:46.803
Ruin the product,
shake up my customers...

31:47.439 --> 31:49.072
But you fellas,

31:49.074 --> 31:51.708
use a smooth approach,
that's clever.

31:51.944 --> 31:54.744
I've got an axe in the car
if you want to go that way.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.880
That won't be necessary.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.649
Follow me.

32:03.222 --> 32:04.921
Victor,

32:05.024 --> 32:06.591
I've got a couple
of buttons here to see you.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.159
What a pleasant surprise!

32:08.160 --> 32:09.693
Do come in.

32:10.462 --> 32:11.930
Do you care for a glass?

32:11.931 --> 32:13.763
No, thank you.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.400
How about you?

32:15.401 --> 32:17.468
Chester tells me
you're a regular.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.070
That you've taken
a keen interest

32:19.071 --> 32:20.605
in our little club,

32:20.606 --> 32:22.707
coming in every night
for the past two weeks,

32:22.708 --> 32:25.875
keeping a close eye
on everyone and everything.

32:27.379 --> 32:28.795
Is that it?

32:28.796 --> 32:30.515
And that you have
a pension for fine wine.

32:30.516 --> 32:34.419
Not something I would expect
from a ruffian such as yourself.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.387
And I wouldn't expect
the colored band leader

32:36.388 --> 32:38.323
to be ordering the muscles
around by you

32:38.324 --> 32:40.992
boot-licking nancy boys
huddle in this office.

32:40.993 --> 32:42.393
- Excuse me?
- Shut up.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.861
So what do you want, exactly?

32:45.331 --> 32:47.532
For you to lay your cards
on the table.

32:47.533 --> 32:51.169
I really don't care who runs
this little bohemian lovefest.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.537
Okay, let's be honest.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.505
It's 1933.

32:54.506 --> 32:56.107
People still get tight

32:56.108 --> 32:57.742
when they see a nigger
running things.

32:57.743 --> 32:59.410
You just figured

32:59.411 --> 33:01.412
that it's better for me
to keep a low profile,

33:01.413 --> 33:04.115
the less black the more green.

33:04.116 --> 33:05.583
Fair enough.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.285
You wanna pose
this clown as the boss

33:07.286 --> 33:08.686
when we know you're the one

33:08.687 --> 33:10.388
- in charge...
- Badge or no badge,

33:10.389 --> 33:12.523
I would advise you
to show some respect!

33:12.524 --> 33:15.084
I think this pig needs a lesson
in some manners.

33:15.461 --> 33:17.160
Don't interrupt, boy!

33:17.596 --> 33:18.996
Men are speaking.

33:20.199 --> 33:22.066
Now, look at what you did.

33:22.067 --> 33:24.736
You got Sam all upset
and that almost never happens.

33:24.737 --> 33:26.703
Everything okay in here, boss?

33:27.573 --> 33:29.207
I still got the axe in the car.

33:29.208 --> 33:30.673
Okay, everybody.

33:32.211 --> 33:33.277
Everybody, cool down.

33:33.278 --> 33:35.113
There's more
than enough to go around.

33:35.114 --> 33:38.081
This is still a business
transaction, am I right?

33:38.117 --> 33:39.517
That's right!

33:40.753 --> 33:42.387
I'm sorry, fellas.

33:42.388 --> 33:44.748
We just got off
from the wrong foot.

33:45.090 --> 33:46.591
Listen, big shot.

33:46.592 --> 33:48.459
There's only one rule
in South Hampton,

33:48.460 --> 33:49.761
everybody pays.

33:49.762 --> 33:53.196
How would you pull in here
a night, a couple of G's?

33:55.501 --> 33:57.135
I'm sorry,
did I say something funny?

33:57.136 --> 33:59.336
No, not at all. Don't mind me.

34:04.343 --> 34:06.042
Do you want your money or not?

34:06.145 --> 34:07.478
Yeah.

34:07.479 --> 34:08.879
But do it slowly.

34:09.514 --> 34:11.181
Take it easy, officer.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.149
Victor's harmless.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.620
You know what?

34:17.623 --> 34:19.943
What are they
just gonna call this?

34:20.559 --> 34:21.958
Back taxes.

34:23.695 --> 34:25.094
We square?

34:25.230 --> 34:26.630
From now.

34:26.799 --> 34:28.833
I'll run it up the flagpole.

34:28.833 --> 34:30.766
See what the chief says.

34:31.070 --> 34:32.469
Come on, Sam.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.773
Welcome to South Hampton.

34:40.545 --> 34:42.512
How rude.

34:43.514 --> 34:45.148
That was too easy.

34:49.655 --> 34:51.522
That was too easy.

34:51.523 --> 34:53.255
I was thinking the same thing.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.291
Hello, again.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.842
You guys gotta do
this right here?

35:35.767 --> 35:36.817
I'll lose my job.

35:36.818 --> 35:38.336
We've just got some more
questions.

35:38.337 --> 35:39.604
What about?

35:39.605 --> 35:41.237
Chester?

35:41.306 --> 35:43.808
- No, he was very helpful.
- Too helpful.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.308
What?

35:45.511 --> 35:47.310
They just paid.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.780
No guff.
I didn't throw a single punch.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.215
I only threw one.

35:51.216 --> 35:52.316
Isn't that a good thing?

35:52.317 --> 35:53.818
Well...

35:53.819 --> 35:55.153
You see, when a fella's willing
to show you

35:55.154 --> 35:56.786
all the cards in his hand,

35:56.788 --> 35:58.823
it usually means he has a few
up his sleeve.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.625
What's up your sleeve, Willie?

36:00.626 --> 36:02.026
Nothing.

36:02.361 --> 36:03.761
Nothing!

36:03.829 --> 36:05.563
I'm not important enough.

36:05.564 --> 36:07.765
I'm taking out the trash,
for Pete's sake.

36:07.766 --> 36:09.166
Look,

36:09.535 --> 36:10.568
we're not stupid.

36:10.569 --> 36:13.471
We know there's something going
on here that's a lot bigger

36:13.472 --> 36:15.840
than some gin joint
selling hootch.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.642
And even if
you are just a busboy,

36:17.643 --> 36:20.677
you've still got eyes.

36:21.213 --> 36:23.814
I bus the tables,
I take out the trash.

36:23.815 --> 36:25.281
What the hell?

36:25.284 --> 36:27.817
You're here every day.

36:28.620 --> 36:29.787
Where are they getting
the booze?

36:29.788 --> 36:31.255
Who have you seen?

36:31.256 --> 36:32.790
I don't know, lots of people.

36:32.791 --> 36:35.224
I'm not your spy,
keep me out of it.

36:36.962 --> 36:39.963
That's alright,
have a seat, have a seat.

36:40.299 --> 36:41.864
Alright, get up.

36:42.901 --> 36:44.268
Nah, hit him again.

36:44.269 --> 36:45.303
Stop!

36:45.304 --> 36:46.637
Alright.

36:46.638 --> 36:48.606
Now you're coming
to your senses.

36:48.607 --> 36:50.908
Are they running hooch
or making it?

36:50.909 --> 36:52.643
I don't know!

36:52.644 --> 36:53.911
I've seen them loading their
truck before.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.645
But I keep out of it.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.681
- Hit him again.
- Stop!

37:00.652 --> 37:02.052
I saw it.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.121
I saw it once on the road.

37:05.490 --> 37:07.223
After I brought Anna home.

37:08.393 --> 37:10.561
They were coming back
from a delivery.

37:10.562 --> 37:11.962
From the South.

37:12.364 --> 37:13.796
I think.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.800
Rosey's is south of town.

37:15.801 --> 37:17.235
Is there a shipment tonight?

37:17.236 --> 37:18.868
How the hell would I know?

37:19.638 --> 37:22.373
Come on guys!
I really like this job.

37:22.374 --> 37:24.073
Don't blow it for me.

37:25.911 --> 37:27.810
Alright, relax.

37:29.014 --> 37:30.581
It's okay.

37:30.582 --> 37:31.649
It's okay.
Look how good you did.

37:31.650 --> 37:32.984
Just remember,

37:32.985 --> 37:34.719
you keep your eyes open.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.419
You keep your mouth shut.

37:38.357 --> 37:39.757
Like I said,

37:39.791 --> 37:41.290
I keep out of it.

37:47.699 --> 37:49.400
Well, partner,
if they're headed south,

37:49.401 --> 37:50.568
that means that they got
to take the Millroad

37:50.569 --> 37:52.209
in order to get to the highway.

37:52.471 --> 37:53.838
I was thinking the same thing.

37:53.839 --> 37:55.640
But let's get the fellas
in on this.

37:55.641 --> 37:56.807
Full setup.

37:56.808 --> 37:57.975
You got it, boss.

37:57.976 --> 37:59.376
Badges and blues.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.361
I only see apples in here.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.463
Are we out of biscuits?

38:20.499 --> 38:21.766
It's not a goddammed picnic.

38:21.767 --> 38:23.287
Just eat whatever's left.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.436
Well, I'm still hungry.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.305
- Then have an apple.
- I don't want an apple.

38:27.306 --> 38:28.506
Then you're not hungry.

38:28.507 --> 38:29.907
Jesus!

38:30.842 --> 38:33.482
You know, I don't think
these goons are gonna show.

38:33.679 --> 38:36.439
I mean, are you sure they're
supposed to pass this way?

38:37.316 --> 38:38.716
No.

38:38.750 --> 38:41.018
No, I'm not sure.

38:41.019 --> 38:44.353
They are bootleggers running
illegal hooch at night.

38:44.523 --> 38:46.524
Alright? They're either
being really careful

38:46.525 --> 38:48.359
or there's a possibility
that maybe...

38:48.360 --> 38:50.426
- Sam.
- Alright.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.731
Listen, Jack's got us covered

38:53.732 --> 38:56.701
but under no circumstances
give away his position, okay?

38:56.702 --> 38:58.002
- You got it?
- Got it.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.437
You got it?

38:59.438 --> 39:01.070
You got it, genius?

39:04.910 --> 39:05.842
Got it, got it.

39:05.843 --> 39:06.777
Alright, come on.
Try and stay sharp here.

39:06.778 --> 39:08.698
- Okay.
- Alright.

39:35.574 --> 39:36.907
What gives, flat foot?

39:36.908 --> 39:39.977
I'm going to need you to ask
the driver to kill that engine

39:39.978 --> 39:42.079
and step out of the truck,
please.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.980
What the hell is this?

39:44.015 --> 39:46.282
We just paid you parasites.

39:46.551 --> 39:47.718
I thought we were square.

39:47.719 --> 39:48.886
Is that...

39:48.887 --> 39:50.788
You thought that did you, yeah?

39:50.789 --> 39:52.156
Well, then you should know

39:52.157 --> 39:54.625
that bootlegging
wasn't part of the deal.

39:54.626 --> 39:57.027
Kill the engine and step out
of the truck, please.

39:57.028 --> 39:58.428
Slowly,

39:58.997 --> 40:01.317
keep your paws
where I can see them.

40:03.869 --> 40:05.368
That's better.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.508
Shit.

40:15.547 --> 40:17.046
Now, listen, fellas,

40:17.449 --> 40:19.081
class is in session.

40:19.084 --> 40:21.819
Have you two ever heard
about this thing

40:21.820 --> 40:24.054
called the Volstead Act?

40:24.055 --> 40:25.990
This is horse shit.

40:25.991 --> 40:28.471
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.459
Hey buddy.

40:30.495 --> 40:32.863
How's the jaw? Sorry about that.

40:32.864 --> 40:34.564
My knuckle still tastes good.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.634
In the truck!

40:36.635 --> 40:39.035
There's somebody in the back.
I saw him!

40:39.671 --> 40:41.071
Go check it out.

40:41.673 --> 40:43.073
Hey!

40:44.443 --> 40:45.910
Good job, fellas.

40:45.911 --> 40:48.945
Now stop fucking around
and just cuff 'em.

40:49.548 --> 40:51.148
See Sam, I told you.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.584
I saw that little twerp sneaking
around back there.

40:53.585 --> 40:55.865
Hey, bring him around. Alright?

40:55.987 --> 40:57.920
Yeah, nice try buddy.

40:58.023 --> 40:59.790
Hey! Don't even think about it.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.191
Or you'll do what?

41:01.827 --> 41:02.993
Don't try me.

41:02.994 --> 41:06.262
Hey, how about we throw down
to see who's the better man.

41:06.731 --> 41:08.998
I'm not going to warn you again!

41:09.468 --> 41:10.868
Just calm down.

41:10.869 --> 41:12.536
It doesn't need to be this way.

41:12.537 --> 41:14.203
I'm done playing games.

41:15.740 --> 41:17.406
What the hell?

41:50.208 --> 41:51.648
I checked the truck.

41:52.110 --> 41:53.510
The truck?

41:53.578 --> 41:54.978
For more men!

41:59.918 --> 42:00.918
Are we clear?

42:00.919 --> 42:01.919
Clear!

42:01.920 --> 42:03.320
Clear.

42:09.961 --> 42:11.694
Pay day!

42:15.867 --> 42:16.967
What is it?

42:16.968 --> 42:19.168
It-it's blood.

42:19.304 --> 42:20.871
Blood?
What are you talking about?

42:20.872 --> 42:22.072
Was there somebody in the truck?

42:22.073 --> 42:24.407
No, it's just bottles.

42:25.143 --> 42:26.977
That's ridiculous.

42:26.978 --> 42:28.078
It's probably just a rotten
batch of moonshine.

42:28.079 --> 42:29.713
It's blood, I tell you!

42:29.714 --> 42:31.982
Why would they be
bootlegging blood?

42:31.983 --> 42:33.516
Isn't it obvious?

42:45.664 --> 42:47.129
Take it slow.

42:48.033 --> 42:52.134
Savor every note running down
your throat.

42:53.271 --> 42:55.471
Enjoy every drop

42:55.574 --> 42:57.373
from the cup, my pet.

43:32.944 --> 43:34.344
Rosey,

43:34.946 --> 43:36.280
how did I get here?

43:36.281 --> 43:38.601
The Haze brothers,
they found you.

43:39.084 --> 43:40.384
Sam?

43:40.385 --> 43:42.086
I gotta tell the chief.

43:42.087 --> 43:43.619
I know all about it.

43:43.722 --> 43:44.722
Chief.

43:44.723 --> 43:46.757
I was providing cover
from the hill

43:46.758 --> 43:48.092
but my rifle jammed.

43:48.093 --> 43:49.393
I ran in with my 45s.

43:49.394 --> 43:51.028
Easy, Jack.

43:51.029 --> 43:52.730
- You've been out a while.
- How long?

43:52.731 --> 43:53.864
I've been at the crime scene
all morning.

43:53.865 --> 43:55.698
What a goddammed mess!

43:56.201 --> 43:57.868
What about the guys?

43:57.869 --> 43:59.903
Sam, Adam, and Bill are dead.

43:59.904 --> 44:01.972
Killed the same way
as Lola Hayes.

44:01.973 --> 44:03.874
Her brothers are out for blood.

44:03.875 --> 44:05.909
They're convinced it's
the same guys who did in Lola.

44:05.910 --> 44:08.270
Like I said,
it's a goddammed mess.

44:08.313 --> 44:10.180
It's Chesterfield's,
that new club.

44:10.181 --> 44:13.183
We got a tip last night
that they were running booze.

44:13.184 --> 44:15.551
Sam and I thought
it was a good...

44:15.920 --> 44:17.154
Goddammit, Sam.

44:17.155 --> 44:18.889
Focus, Jack!

44:18.890 --> 44:20.324
Did you say
they were from Chesterfield's?

44:20.325 --> 44:21.824
Three men.

44:22.193 --> 44:23.994
But there was a gunfight.

44:23.995 --> 44:25.362
Sam got one of them.
I took out the other one.

44:25.363 --> 44:27.931
Three? There was
enough blood for 10 men.

44:27.932 --> 44:29.733
Ten? No.

44:29.734 --> 44:31.201
Well, they're gone now.

44:31.202 --> 44:33.003
Just tire tracks.

44:33.004 --> 44:34.738
They must have taken
their dead with them.

44:34.739 --> 44:35.939
Chesterfield's.

44:35.940 --> 44:38.207
They must have gone back there.

44:38.677 --> 44:40.377
We shook down that kid.

44:40.378 --> 44:41.811
Willie Cranston.

44:42.180 --> 44:43.981
Out back of the club.

44:43.982 --> 44:46.622
He was the one who tipped us off
to the shipment.

44:46.885 --> 44:48.752
That little shit,
he sold us out!

44:48.753 --> 44:50.721
That's not true. You're a liar!

44:50.722 --> 44:52.289
Anna, now's not the time!

44:52.290 --> 44:55.291
You're gonna believe him
of all people?

44:56.294 --> 44:58.227
Goddammit.

44:59.764 --> 45:01.131
I say we go find
that Willie kid,

45:01.132 --> 45:02.166
beat the truth out of him.

45:02.167 --> 45:03.734
Calm down!

45:03.735 --> 45:05.135
We already have
a suspect in custody

45:05.136 --> 45:06.870
for your sister's murder.

45:06.871 --> 45:08.839
Well, it's all connected,
I'm telling you!

45:08.840 --> 45:10.441
Just stick to running 'shine
and leave the police work to me.

45:10.442 --> 45:12.076
We got to get to Chesterfield's.

45:12.077 --> 45:13.377
You're not going anywhere!

45:13.378 --> 45:16.278
Don't worry, Jack. We got this.

45:17.849 --> 45:20.516
You and your brother
want some payback?

45:39.104 --> 45:42.372
Will you stop
that infernal caterwauling?

45:42.373 --> 45:44.773
Aw, come on, Mr. Renfield.

45:45.009 --> 45:47.910
You said I could practice
after we closed the joint.

45:47.979 --> 45:49.513
Yes, but at the moment,

45:49.514 --> 45:53.182
your assault on my ears
is more than I can bear.

45:54.152 --> 45:55.792
Where did you find that crate?

45:56.121 --> 45:57.287
Behind the stage
under some drapes.

45:57.288 --> 46:00.324
I thought you wanted me
to bring out the booze.

46:00.325 --> 46:03.225
It's not booze, it...

46:03.261 --> 46:04.895
Never mind what it is.

46:04.896 --> 46:06.396
Just put it back
where you found it.

46:06.397 --> 46:08.031
I'll deal with the blood-sucking
thieves myself.

46:08.032 --> 46:10.633
- Mr. Renfield?
- Yes, Rita?

46:10.902 --> 46:12.269
Can I sing now?

46:12.270 --> 46:14.570
No, you cannot sing.

46:15.206 --> 46:17.141
And when I say you cannot sing,

46:17.142 --> 46:19.176
I do not mean you cannot sing
now or later.

46:19.177 --> 46:21.445
I mean you cannot sing at all.

46:21.446 --> 46:23.514
You tone-deaf little strumpet.

46:23.515 --> 46:25.415
Your talents
would better serve you

46:25.416 --> 46:27.785
laying on your back
in a cat house.

46:27.786 --> 46:30.352
Not prancing about on my stage.

46:33.391 --> 46:34.525
Rita, darling,

46:34.526 --> 46:35.492
suck it up.

46:35.493 --> 46:38.894
Or I'll find myself
another cigarette girl.

46:39.297 --> 46:40.863
Little trollop.

46:50.909 --> 46:52.508
This is a raid.

46:52.944 --> 46:54.945
Rita? Get the hell out of here

46:54.946 --> 46:57.347
before I tell your mother who
you've really been working for.

46:57.348 --> 46:59.315
- What?
- Go!

46:59.417 --> 47:02.319
Was it really necessary
to smash the front door in?

47:02.320 --> 47:03.720
Shut up.

47:04.222 --> 47:05.823
Fine.

47:05.824 --> 47:07.858
Then I demand
to see a search warrant.

47:07.859 --> 47:09.825
I said, "shut up!"

47:10.028 --> 47:12.928
You pissed in my sandbox,
pinky ring.

47:12.931 --> 47:14.630
And now you're going to pay.

47:28.279 --> 47:29.679
What do we do?

47:31.883 --> 47:33.549
Smash it all.

48:10.355 --> 48:11.955
Stupid Jack.

48:11.956 --> 48:14.396
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

48:16.227 --> 48:17.627
Anna!

48:20.965 --> 48:22.165
What are you doing here?

48:22.166 --> 48:23.467
The police are looking for you.

48:23.468 --> 48:25.669
I know, they busted up the club.

48:25.670 --> 48:27.571
I thought they were
paying off the cops.

48:27.572 --> 48:29.406
Jack said that men
from your club

48:29.407 --> 48:31.141
came by last night
and ambushed them.

48:31.142 --> 48:32.542
They're blaming you.

48:32.543 --> 48:33.911
Me?

48:33.912 --> 48:35.379
They think you set them up.

48:35.380 --> 48:37.514
Shit.

48:37.515 --> 48:38.915
Did you?

48:39.050 --> 48:40.284
What? No!

48:40.285 --> 48:41.518
Were you there? Did you see?

48:41.519 --> 48:45.522
Jack and Sam came to the club
last night and they squeezed me.

48:45.523 --> 48:47.424
So, I told them what they
wanted. That's it.

48:47.425 --> 48:49.459
I didn't tell anyone else.

48:49.460 --> 48:51.528
I'd lose my job if I did,
I swear.

48:51.529 --> 48:54.097
Ok, it's okay. I believe you
but it doesn't matter.

48:54.098 --> 48:55.699
They think you were in on it.

48:55.700 --> 48:57.567
You got to get out of here
before anyone sees you.

48:57.568 --> 48:59.435
Anna, baby, I've been thinking.

49:00.605 --> 49:03.674
Running around like a fugitive
all day made me think,

49:03.675 --> 49:05.375
a lot,

49:05.376 --> 49:08.344
about everything,
about us, our future.

49:08.479 --> 49:09.579
What are you saying?

49:09.580 --> 49:11.347
I want to marry you.

49:12.951 --> 49:14.067
Always have.

49:14.068 --> 49:15.986
But times have turned
and we got to do it now.

49:15.987 --> 49:17.554
I want you to come away with me,

49:17.555 --> 49:20.789
away from this town,
a new life just for us.

49:22.193 --> 49:23.527
I can't.

49:23.528 --> 49:24.960
My mama...

49:25.263 --> 49:26.962
It's not forever.

49:26.998 --> 49:29.299
We run away now, get married,

49:29.300 --> 49:30.667
and come back
when thing cool down.

49:30.668 --> 49:32.202
I promise.

49:32.203 --> 49:34.870
But how, how can we live?

49:36.007 --> 49:37.341
I got that figured out.

49:37.342 --> 49:38.742
The club.

49:40.979 --> 49:44.046
Victor keeps his secret stash
of money in his office.

49:44.148 --> 49:45.914
I spied him hiding it once.

49:47.452 --> 49:49.152
But now the club is empty.

49:49.153 --> 49:50.886
It's easy peasy.

49:51.022 --> 49:54.156
There's got to be 1000 dollars
in that box.

49:55.560 --> 49:57.459
The police are looking for you.

49:57.595 --> 50:00.230
By now, everyone in town
knows what happened.

50:00.231 --> 50:02.831
How can we even get
there without getting caught.

50:04.369 --> 50:06.535
We just stay off the roads.

50:06.637 --> 50:08.037
Please.

50:08.039 --> 50:09.373
We got to go right now.

50:09.374 --> 50:10.973
Jesus.

50:11.009 --> 50:13.010
Willie, like this?
I need my things.

50:13.011 --> 50:14.491
Don't worry about that.

50:14.746 --> 50:17.012
We'll buy you all new things.

50:17.015 --> 50:18.415
Trust me.

50:18.416 --> 50:19.948
Please.

50:21.152 --> 50:22.552
I do.

50:41.272 --> 50:42.372
You know Victor?

50:42.373 --> 50:43.807
We smash down your door,

50:43.808 --> 50:45.675
bust up all your booze,
drag you in here

50:45.676 --> 50:48.357
and you haven't even asked me
what this is all about.

50:48.646 --> 50:50.680
I can only assume
you're not satisfied

50:50.681 --> 50:52.416
with our current arrangement.

50:52.417 --> 50:54.317
Arrangement?

50:54.318 --> 50:56.186
I send three of my men
to collect a little luxury tax

50:56.187 --> 50:57.621
and the next thing I know,
they're all dead.

50:57.622 --> 51:01.224
I wouldn't know the first thing
about killing anyone, Mr...

51:01.225 --> 51:03.859
Chief of Police Farley.

51:04.395 --> 51:07.397
You murdered three cops,
you foppy little weasel.

51:07.398 --> 51:08.799
I'm going to have
a front row seat

51:08.800 --> 51:11.080
when they strap you
to the chair.

51:12.403 --> 51:14.870
I know this game.

51:15.339 --> 51:16.807
And then I say,

51:16.808 --> 51:18.508
"I can assure you, Chief Farley,"

51:18.509 --> 51:20.277
I murdered no one.

51:20.278 --> 51:21.812
I was at the club all night

51:21.813 --> 51:23.713
and there are
scores of witnesses

51:23.714 --> 51:25.282
"who will attest to just that."

51:25.283 --> 51:27.015
You really think that matters?

51:27.085 --> 51:29.553
You silk-suited smart guys
really crack me up.

51:29.554 --> 51:32.355
You got the master plan all
figured out?

51:32.356 --> 51:35.392
Your men killed three cops
and skipped the scene

51:35.393 --> 51:37.828
but you left a living witness,
genius.

51:37.829 --> 51:39.096
A cop.

51:39.097 --> 51:40.730
He saw the whole thing.

51:40.731 --> 51:43.131
Now, start talking!

51:51.742 --> 51:53.542
Chief Farley,

51:53.744 --> 51:55.144
in the...

51:55.613 --> 51:58.648
breast pocket of my silk vest

51:58.649 --> 52:00.684
you'll find a business card

52:00.685 --> 52:02.150
and on it

52:02.386 --> 52:04.521
you'll be able
to read quite clearly

52:04.522 --> 52:07.823
the name and number
to my attorney.

52:08.392 --> 52:11.161
Would you be so kind
as to phone him for me?

52:11.162 --> 52:13.095
You little shit.

52:13.297 --> 52:14.798
That's okay.

52:14.799 --> 52:18.300
I got everything I need to burn
your sorry ass.

52:18.503 --> 52:22.070
You just sit in here
and think about that.

52:22.773 --> 52:24.640
On the gate!

52:32.350 --> 52:34.683
Thank you so much, Chief Farley!

52:38.356 --> 52:40.622
Goddammit.

52:40.625 --> 52:42.985
What are you complaining
about now?

52:43.494 --> 52:45.328
I'm out of cigarettes.

52:45.329 --> 52:46.730
Give me your keys,
I'm going to go get some more.

52:46.731 --> 52:48.431
You're not taking
my car anywhere.

52:48.432 --> 52:49.566
This is bullshit.

52:49.567 --> 52:50.800
What am I supposed to do?

52:50.801 --> 52:52.602
Loaf around here
for days on end?

52:52.603 --> 52:53.803
I should be off at the station
with the guys.

52:53.804 --> 52:55.672
The guys can't use you

52:55.673 --> 52:57.240
in the condition
you're in right now.

52:57.241 --> 52:58.575
You need to relax.

52:58.576 --> 53:00.776
Give me your fucking keys.

53:03.814 --> 53:05.815
You need to rest.

53:05.816 --> 53:06.917
Ok?

53:06.918 --> 53:11.253
The chief will call you
when he wants your help.

53:12.490 --> 53:15.324
I'll take you home.
You relax there.

53:15.393 --> 53:17.993
When he needs you,
he'll come get you, alright?

53:18.930 --> 53:20.330
Ok.

53:20.331 --> 53:21.731
Ok.

53:32.343 --> 53:33.944
I think I'm losing my mind.

53:33.945 --> 53:35.779
You lost that years ago.

53:35.780 --> 53:37.713
No, I'm serious.

53:37.882 --> 53:40.148
What I saw, who I saw,

53:40.318 --> 53:41.718
forget it.

53:42.653 --> 53:44.186
It's okay.

53:44.589 --> 53:46.154
You can talk to me.

53:49.393 --> 53:50.794
Last night, I saw a man.

53:50.795 --> 53:52.629
I don't know
how I missed it before

53:52.630 --> 53:54.364
but I got a good look
at him through my scope

53:54.365 --> 53:56.566
just before shit hit the fan.

53:56.567 --> 53:57.500
What about him?

53:57.501 --> 53:58.702
I know him.

53:58.703 --> 54:01.571
I knew him from the war.
You knew I was a snipper, right?

54:01.572 --> 54:03.940
Yes, it was a rotten war,
you did rotten things.

54:03.941 --> 54:05.909
We talked about all this before.

54:05.910 --> 54:09.277
Yes, but there was one thing
I did that I never told you.

54:09.847 --> 54:11.247
Something awful.

54:12.683 --> 54:13.650
See...

54:13.651 --> 54:16.019
Sometimes they'd negotiate
a truce

54:16.020 --> 54:18.755
for the purpose
of retrieving the casualties.

54:18.756 --> 54:20.824
We'd send our medics and
stretcher bearers

54:20.825 --> 54:23.727
into no man's land
to treat the wounded.

54:23.728 --> 54:25.795
But I never trusted the Jerries.

54:25.796 --> 54:27.464
I watched
their medics like a hawk,

54:27.465 --> 54:28.965
making sure their stretchers

54:28.966 --> 54:31.800
weren't hiding guns
or any other surprises.

54:32.670 --> 54:34.738
But there was this one medic.

54:34.739 --> 54:36.573
He was alone.

54:36.574 --> 54:38.541
Just him with the wounded,
it didn't make sense.

54:38.542 --> 54:40.142
Then suddenly

54:40.378 --> 54:42.679
he looked at me
through the scope.

54:42.680 --> 54:44.379
I mean right at me.

54:45.383 --> 54:47.823
So I shot him straight
through the head.

54:48.686 --> 54:51.354
I don't know why I did it.
It didn't make any sense.

54:51.355 --> 54:52.722
He was a medic.

54:52.723 --> 54:56.860
Then all hell broke loose and
everybody started shooting.

54:56.861 --> 54:58.461
It was a disaster.

54:58.462 --> 55:00.862
A lot of good men died
because of me.

55:01.732 --> 55:03.331
Thinking back, I...

55:03.334 --> 55:04.501
can't get my head around it.

55:04.502 --> 55:06.902
I don't know what came over me.

55:07.505 --> 55:11.873
Last night,
this guy in my scope...

55:12.743 --> 55:14.744
It was that medic.

55:14.745 --> 55:17.012
- That's impossible.
- I know!

55:17.715 --> 55:19.995
But it certainly looked
like him.

55:20.618 --> 55:23.351
It reminded me
of memories long buried.

55:25.623 --> 55:27.289
Or rather drowned.

55:29.827 --> 55:32.894
This has been
my best friend ever since.

55:33.798 --> 55:35.632
You know what's funny?

55:35.633 --> 55:38.273
Today is the longest stretch
that I've been sober

55:38.336 --> 55:39.868
for a while.

55:48.846 --> 55:51.915
Well, it's been a sobering day
for all of us.

55:51.916 --> 55:55.016
And I've been thinking a bit,
myself.

55:56.020 --> 55:57.687
But...

55:57.688 --> 55:59.456
I don't want to add
to your condition.

55:59.457 --> 56:00.857
Um...

56:02.593 --> 56:03.993
Here.

56:04.762 --> 56:07.129
Take this,
I want you to have it.

56:07.565 --> 56:09.831
It's always given me strength.

56:10.134 --> 56:11.900
Your rosary.

56:12.937 --> 56:15.538
I'm not what you'd call
a model Catholic anymore.

56:15.539 --> 56:18.240
- I can't take this.
- It's... I'm loaning it to you.

56:19.577 --> 56:23.378
Maybe instead of reaching
for the booze, try your faith.

56:26.016 --> 56:29.484
We've been together a long time,
Jack, and I just...

56:30.388 --> 56:32.655
I can't stand to see you
like this.

56:32.656 --> 56:34.523
Rosey, come on now.

56:34.925 --> 56:36.159
Hey!

56:36.160 --> 56:38.027
That's not the girl I know.

56:38.028 --> 56:39.829
The Rosey I know would beat

56:39.830 --> 56:42.430
the shit out of four sailors
with a frying pan.

56:43.501 --> 56:44.901
They were marines.

56:45.102 --> 56:47.135
Marines, sailors.

56:47.505 --> 56:50.272
The frying pan part was right,
though, right?

56:50.541 --> 56:53.074
Yeah, your brain
isn't complete mush.

56:53.144 --> 56:54.544
Yet.

56:55.045 --> 56:57.913
After today, I'm not so sure.

57:07.758 --> 57:09.158
Golly.

57:11.162 --> 57:12.429
Wait!

57:12.430 --> 57:13.496
For what?

57:13.497 --> 57:15.432
Something's not right.

57:15.433 --> 57:16.699
Of course it's not right,
everything's busted to shit.

57:16.700 --> 57:18.300
No, that's not what I meant.

57:18.969 --> 57:20.570
Come on, we'll get the money

57:20.571 --> 57:22.472
and we'll be out
of here lickety-split.

57:22.473 --> 57:23.540
Ok?

57:23.541 --> 57:24.973
Be careful.

57:26.177 --> 57:27.510
Keep an eye out.

57:27.511 --> 57:28.911
Hurry back.

57:49.500 --> 57:50.966
Hello, William.

57:52.570 --> 57:53.970
Mr. Chester.

58:00.678 --> 58:02.078
Mr. Chester...

58:02.913 --> 58:04.512
Hold your tongue.

58:04.648 --> 58:07.088
It may be the only thing
that saves you.

58:08.252 --> 58:10.352
She's a pure one.

58:10.821 --> 58:13.256
Well that is unexpected.

58:13.257 --> 58:14.657
Willie?

58:15.025 --> 58:16.626
It's okay. I got this, baby.

58:16.627 --> 58:19.028
Nice. Where's Victor?

58:19.029 --> 58:20.730
I'm not sure.

58:20.731 --> 58:23.371
Willie, you know
what I value more than anything?

58:23.968 --> 58:27.435
- Mr. Chester...
- Loyalty, William, loyalty.

58:27.671 --> 58:29.337
It has been the key

58:29.507 --> 58:32.275
to my survival
for all these years.

58:32.276 --> 58:35.678
I'm loyal, Mr. Chester.
I swear. I'm just...

58:35.679 --> 58:38.480
I am not going to make
the same mistake

58:38.616 --> 58:40.548
that my master did.

58:41.185 --> 58:43.118
See these scars?

58:44.054 --> 58:46.956
My master told me I was special.

58:46.957 --> 58:49.292
He trusted me.
He confided in me.

58:49.293 --> 58:52.093
He made me what I am today.

58:52.863 --> 58:55.497
Then one day
at the crack of dawn,

58:56.133 --> 58:59.534
I drove a steak
through his motherfucking heart.

59:00.838 --> 59:03.505
That was 137 years ago.

59:03.541 --> 59:05.340
March to be exact.

59:05.843 --> 59:08.543
So if you're thinking about
double crossing me,

59:08.679 --> 59:10.713
I will split your wrists

59:10.714 --> 59:14.015
and turn your little Anna
into my concubine.

59:18.689 --> 59:20.221
Willie!

59:23.294 --> 59:25.360
Loyalty, William.

59:27.898 --> 59:29.014
Loyalty.

59:29.015 --> 59:31.335
You're going
to do exactly as I say.

59:42.146 --> 59:43.947
What's that all about?

59:43.948 --> 59:45.747
Are you open for business?

59:45.749 --> 59:48.184
George?
He's one of the regulars.

59:48.185 --> 59:50.219
Three cops just died.

59:50.220 --> 59:53.288
I would've thought you could've
stopped whoring for one night.

59:53.591 --> 59:55.191
Well, I haven't thought
about it that way

59:55.192 --> 59:57.293
but I wonder
if three whores died,

59:57.294 --> 59:59.461
if you'd stop being a cop.

01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:04.033
I'm sorry.

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:06.202
It's just been a long day.

01:00:06.203 --> 01:00:09.672
Well, you ain't kidding.
This is a goddammed disaster.

01:00:09.673 --> 01:00:12.073
I let all the other girls
go home early.

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:13.810
Lily's a wreck.

01:00:13.811 --> 01:00:15.044
Violet's been
so out of sorts lately.

01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:17.278
We all have our ways of coping.

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:20.183
How about a drink for you
and the fellas?

01:00:20.184 --> 01:00:21.184
On the house.

01:00:21.185 --> 01:00:22.151
Aw, thanks but...

01:00:22.152 --> 01:00:25.487
Too much going on to be getting
sauced.

01:00:25.889 --> 01:00:27.389
Where's Jack?

01:00:29.994 --> 01:00:31.327
I drove him home.

01:00:31.328 --> 01:00:32.996
- You what?
- Just calm down.

01:00:32.997 --> 01:00:34.330
All of you were so hot
under the collar,

01:00:34.331 --> 01:00:36.265
both you and Jack.

01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:37.934
Jack's got his own demons
he's dealing with.

01:00:37.935 --> 01:00:40.175
He doesn't need you riding him.

01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:43.339
What's done is done.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.308
The dead are gone.

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:47.944
No matter how much you run
around, you can't change that.

01:00:47.945 --> 01:00:49.345
Just...

01:00:49.647 --> 01:00:51.379
Focus on the living.

01:00:57.421 --> 01:00:58.821
Free drinks?

01:01:00.224 --> 01:01:02.123
It's the least I could do.

01:02:20.504 --> 01:02:22.370
He ate them.

01:02:32.282 --> 01:02:33.349
Who is it?

01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:34.484
It's me, Jack.

01:02:34.485 --> 01:02:35.885
Willie Cranston.

01:02:36.453 --> 01:02:39.654
The fuck are you doing here?

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:42.691
I need your help.

01:02:43.127 --> 01:02:45.193
Sure, I'll help you.

01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:47.230
You set us up.

01:02:47.231 --> 01:02:49.265
You got Sam killed.

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:51.968
Where the fuck do you get
the balls to come here?

01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:53.601
Ask for my help?

01:02:53.904 --> 01:02:56.638
- I'm in trouble, Jack.
- Whoa, easy, Tex.

01:02:56.907 --> 01:02:58.506
Graduating?

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:00.409
Well, you sure don't get
any smarter.

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:02.411
What can I do for you, Willie?

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:04.547
- Victor.
- What about him?

01:03:04.548 --> 01:03:07.016
I need you to come with me
and get him out of the jail.

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:08.950
Victor the murder suspect?

01:03:09.553 --> 01:03:11.287
How do you think
that's going to fly?

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:12.789
You're still on our hotlist.

01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:14.157
You're a cop, just do it!

01:03:14.158 --> 01:03:15.191
Ok, kid.

01:03:15.192 --> 01:03:18.860
Just ease your finger off
that trigger.

01:03:19.163 --> 01:03:20.929
It's liable to go off.

01:03:20.998 --> 01:03:22.565
I don't want to hurt you.

01:03:22.566 --> 01:03:24.467
Well, you sure got a funny way
of showing it.

01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:26.102
I had nothing to do
with that ambush.

01:03:26.103 --> 01:03:27.869
I'm just a bus boy.

01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:30.506
Well, I'll be sure
to keep that in mind.

01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:31.973
Let's just go.

01:03:56.466 --> 01:03:58.366
A hand like a foot.

01:04:18.989 --> 01:04:21.090
What the hell
are we waiting for?

01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:23.392
Let's burn the house down
and kill them all.

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:25.873
Haven't you learned
anything from Chester?

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:28.231
Why use a sword

01:04:28.232 --> 01:04:30.298
when you can use a needle.

01:04:37.574 --> 01:04:39.934
You look beautiful tonight,
baby doll.

01:04:40.077 --> 01:04:41.609
As usual.

01:04:42.079 --> 01:04:43.479
Yeah, that's good.

01:04:45.616 --> 01:04:47.315
That's it.

01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:50.419
Nice.

01:04:51.588 --> 01:04:53.522
You're a little frisky tonight.

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:55.323
What's wrong with you?

01:04:57.961 --> 01:04:59.927
Little tomcat.

01:05:28.692 --> 01:05:30.391
That's my cue.

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:48.711
Hold it, fella.
We've got a situation upstairs.

01:05:48.712 --> 01:05:50.579
- It ain't safe for you here.
- Safe?

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:53.381
Why? Do you have holy water
and a wooden steak?

01:05:54.051 --> 01:05:55.451
What?

01:06:05.495 --> 01:06:06.529
God almighty!

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:08.096
What did you do?

01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:29.645
I sure hope you know
what you're doing, kid.

01:07:29.646 --> 01:07:32.448
Just doing what I got to do.
It's nothing personal.

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:34.550
You do know there's
a guard in there.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:36.031
I'll take care of him.

01:07:36.553 --> 01:07:38.073
What are you going to do?

01:07:38.188 --> 01:07:40.723
Knock him out? Shoot him?

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:42.591
Whatever you've got planned,
I'm a witness.

01:07:42.592 --> 01:07:44.193
Did you think of that, dumbass?

01:07:44.194 --> 01:07:45.594
Shut up.

01:07:46.463 --> 01:07:49.198
So, Chester gets Victor back
and what?

01:07:49.199 --> 01:07:51.434
He just lets you ride off
into the sunset?

01:07:51.435 --> 01:07:53.201
I said, "shut up!"

01:07:56.706 --> 01:07:58.107
You know, kid,

01:07:58.108 --> 01:08:00.107
payback is a bitch.

01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:10.818
Hey, Jack!

01:08:11.721 --> 01:08:13.456
Who's the nancy boy?

01:08:13.457 --> 01:08:15.691
All right, that's enough.
Give me the keys.

01:08:15.692 --> 01:08:17.158
I can't do that.

01:08:22.532 --> 01:08:24.098
Nancy boy?

01:08:25.469 --> 01:08:26.652
Kiss my ass!

01:08:26.653 --> 01:08:28.203
Jesus, kid,
I didn't know you had it in you.

01:08:28.205 --> 01:08:30.765
Best keep that in mind.
Now get the goddam key.

01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:33.640
Okay, kid, you're the boss.

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:40.948
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:42.885
I was beginning to think
the wheels of justice

01:08:42.886 --> 01:08:45.051
had ground to a halt.

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:46.788
Don't push your luck, asshole.

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:49.325
Just you and your boy get
the fuck out of here.

01:08:49.326 --> 01:08:50.725
No need to be rude, officer.

01:08:50.727 --> 01:08:53.560
Be gracious in defeat
and move on.

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:56.031
Now, get in.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:57.633
Fuck you!

01:08:57.634 --> 01:09:01.135
We have no time to quibble,
William. Just shoot him.

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:03.738
Yeah, Willie, shot me.

01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:05.875
I will.

01:09:05.876 --> 01:09:07.542
Stay put.

01:09:07.544 --> 01:09:09.904
Don't follow us,
or you're a dead man.

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:17.819
Pretty bold move for a busboy.

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:19.554
You'll make Chester proud.

01:09:19.856 --> 01:09:21.423
Chester?

01:09:21.424 --> 01:09:23.225
That son-of-a-bitch
has got my girl

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:24.292
and I have got to deliver you
to get her back.

01:09:24.294 --> 01:09:26.295
So that's your angle.

01:09:26.296 --> 01:09:29.265
And here I was thinking you were
going to join our little clan.

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:30.399
Clan?

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:32.368
Is that what you call it?

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:34.803
Chester and that singer lady
were all over Anna like animals.

01:09:34.804 --> 01:09:36.939
Vampires, actually.

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:39.675
Immortals who rule the night.

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:42.243
And Chester is the master.

01:09:43.647 --> 01:09:45.948
I thought he was just
a rumrunner from down South.

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:48.484
I know.
It's such a perfect disguise.

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:51.187
Rumrunners, bootleggers,
scofflaws,

01:09:51.188 --> 01:09:53.354
every Tom, Dick, and Harry
has a double life

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:55.224
of some sort these days.

01:09:55.225 --> 01:09:58.326
And vampires thrive
in this world.

01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:00.728
The blood business is booming.

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:03.666
What?

01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:06.335
Is that what was
in those bottles?

01:10:06.336 --> 01:10:09.370
And you just turned a blind eye
like everyone else.

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.640
We were operating
in plain sight.

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:13.809
Look but don't see. Don't think.

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:15.511
Just have another drink

01:10:15.512 --> 01:10:17.872
and pretend the night
will never end.

01:10:17.948 --> 01:10:20.648
Just get in the car before
Chester changes his mind.

01:10:20.817 --> 01:10:22.316
Yes, sir.

01:10:24.921 --> 01:10:27.221
Quite a conundrum, Officer...

01:10:27.457 --> 01:10:29.258
I never did quite get your name.

01:10:29.259 --> 01:10:30.992
I never told you.

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:34.161
Seems the fortunes have changed

01:10:34.231 --> 01:10:35.431
but not for the better

01:10:35.432 --> 01:10:37.164
at least not for you.

01:10:37.334 --> 01:10:39.233
You're out of your league.

01:10:39.336 --> 01:10:41.235
This is the devil at work.

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:44.405
Vampires walk among us.

01:10:48.011 --> 01:10:49.778
I've seen this before.

01:10:49.779 --> 01:10:51.981
Yes, yes!

01:10:51.982 --> 01:10:53.949
I knew that about you.

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:57.051
You bear a cross.
I can see it in your eyes.

01:10:58.588 --> 01:10:59.855
Forget it.

01:10:59.856 --> 01:11:01.991
They will stop at nothing!

01:11:01.992 --> 01:11:04.925
These demons will suck
this town dry.

01:11:05.028 --> 01:11:07.329
Do you know
how to kill a vampire?

01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:09.331
I can stop them. I can!

01:11:09.332 --> 01:11:11.667
Gun or knife or steak.

01:11:11.668 --> 01:11:14.769
I prepared. You'll need me!

01:11:33.556 --> 01:11:35.322
Barbarians.

01:11:35.392 --> 01:11:37.391
Anna, I got him!

01:11:38.361 --> 01:11:39.561
Annabelle!

01:11:39.562 --> 01:11:42.463
Sir Camelot is here to save you.

01:11:44.534 --> 01:11:45.934
Where is she?

01:11:46.403 --> 01:11:47.369
Around.

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:50.839
Where is she? I did my part.
Now, let us go.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.407
And you did it so well,
thank you.

01:11:55.412 --> 01:11:56.877
I will kill you.

01:11:57.747 --> 01:11:58.714
Willie...

01:11:58.715 --> 01:12:02.384
You should have probably
let me drive the car.

01:12:02.385 --> 01:12:04.053
You place way too much focus
on the road

01:12:04.054 --> 01:12:07.221
and I have very nimble fingers.

01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:14.361
Now look what you did,
you stupid, stupid, boy.

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:16.031
Where's Anna?

01:12:16.032 --> 01:12:19.033
By now,
probably in several places.

01:12:21.404 --> 01:12:24.271
The next on will be
between the eyes.

01:12:24.741 --> 01:12:26.508
Now, sit there and bleed quietly

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:29.043
while I collect my things.

01:12:31.047 --> 01:12:32.381
Please.

01:12:32.382 --> 01:12:34.181
Tell me where Anna is.

01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:36.919
You know, the great thing about
working for the devil is

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.754
you can always hit shit
in a bible.

01:12:39.989 --> 01:12:41.756
Where's Anna?

01:12:45.595 --> 01:12:47.962
I want you to know something.

01:12:48.064 --> 01:12:49.998
The only reason you're alive

01:12:49.999 --> 01:12:52.767
is because Chester likes you.

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:57.505
Mortals can be very valuable
to vampires.

01:12:58.375 --> 01:13:01.776
And it pays very well.
Trust me, I know.

01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:04.847
If you keep pressure
on that leg,

01:13:04.848 --> 01:13:06.382
you may actually live.

01:13:06.383 --> 01:13:07.649
Please.

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:08.617
Anna.

01:13:08.618 --> 01:13:11.987
You don't get it kid.
She belongs to him now.

01:13:11.988 --> 01:13:14.156
Everything is now his.

01:13:14.157 --> 01:13:15.858
I have some advice for you.

01:13:15.859 --> 01:13:19.160
Cut your losses, as they say,
and skip town.

01:13:19.396 --> 01:13:21.797
The feast has begun and once
they get a taste for blood,

01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:23.899
no one is safe.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.432
Not even me.

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:29.336
Please, I'm begging you.

01:13:29.672 --> 01:13:31.039
Sorry, kid.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.907
I don't do charity.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.554
Forget about them.

01:13:45.555 --> 01:13:47.122
They're just servants
to the master.

01:13:47.123 --> 01:13:49.825
It's Chesterfield,
he's the alpha!

01:13:49.826 --> 01:13:51.193
Here.

01:13:51.194 --> 01:13:53.195
What's that for?

01:13:53.196 --> 01:13:55.898
We're going to need some heat
to take these bastards down.

01:13:55.899 --> 01:13:57.065
Where's the chief?

01:13:57.066 --> 01:13:58.200
Those guns won't kill them.

01:13:58.201 --> 01:13:59.802
We'll see about that.

01:13:59.803 --> 01:14:01.837
Satan's army is at the door!

01:14:01.838 --> 01:14:03.939
We must act now
before it's too late.

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.742
If you don't shut the hell up,
I'm going to come over there

01:14:06.743 --> 01:14:08.477
and rip your goddamn tongue out.

01:14:08.478 --> 01:14:10.177
Amen to that!

01:14:12.015 --> 01:14:14.014
Where's the chief and crew?

01:14:14.551 --> 01:14:15.918
They went to go see you.

01:14:15.919 --> 01:14:17.319
Rosey's.

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:42.510
Someone's coming.

01:15:02.599 --> 01:15:04.032
Where's Anna?

01:15:04.033 --> 01:15:06.235
You've got some fucking nerve.

01:15:06.236 --> 01:15:07.803
What happened to your leg?

01:15:07.804 --> 01:15:09.972
Victor,
that son-of-a-bitch shot me.

01:15:09.973 --> 01:15:12.574
Geez, stupid shit,
what were you thinking?

01:15:12.575 --> 01:15:14.174
I'm sorry!

01:15:14.577 --> 01:15:16.178
Anna and I...

01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:17.880
We went to the club we were
going to steal...

01:15:17.881 --> 01:15:19.580
I did something stupid.

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:21.250
My god, Anna?

01:15:21.251 --> 01:15:23.083
Where is she?

01:15:23.653 --> 01:15:25.152
They took her!

01:15:42.238 --> 01:15:43.939
Magnificent, isn't it?

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:45.973
What is this place?

01:15:46.543 --> 01:15:47.976
This, my dear,

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:50.913
is the evolution of our species

01:15:50.914 --> 01:15:54.583
where we rise above the savagery
of our ancestors.

01:15:54.584 --> 01:15:55.918
My god!

01:15:55.919 --> 01:15:58.252
- No!
- Please don't upset them.

01:15:58.288 --> 01:16:00.289
Fear and pain have
an adverse effect

01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:03.225
on the quality
and value of the livestock.

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:04.760
You're insane.

01:16:04.761 --> 01:16:06.527
It would seem that way.

01:16:06.696 --> 01:16:08.730
But for our discriminating
clientele

01:16:08.731 --> 01:16:12.333
it is no longer enough
to simply exist.

01:16:13.002 --> 01:16:15.970
Eternity is a very long time.

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:18.574
We need to find pleasure
where we can.

01:16:18.575 --> 01:16:22.609
Human blood should
be enjoyed like fine wine.

01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:25.646
Let me out of here. Help!

01:16:26.649 --> 01:16:29.051
You'll ruin the batch.

01:16:29.052 --> 01:16:31.585
You have
a very bright future here.

01:16:32.055 --> 01:16:35.055
From your smell,
I can tell you're a virgin.

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:38.158
And that's
the sweetest blood of all.

01:16:39.662 --> 01:16:41.597
We don't know if Chester's men
are on a rampage

01:16:41.598 --> 01:16:43.065
or still at the club.

01:16:43.066 --> 01:16:44.700
So just get
on that highway and drive

01:16:44.701 --> 01:16:47.368
- and do not stop until sunrise.
- Got it.

01:16:48.204 --> 01:16:50.204
These are all I could find.

01:16:50.907 --> 01:16:52.941
- Just...
- I'll bring her back.

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:54.176
I swear to god.

01:16:54.177 --> 01:16:56.110
I love her more than anything.

01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:58.179
I know you do.

01:17:04.988 --> 01:17:06.355
Jack.

01:17:06.356 --> 01:17:07.956
Shouldn't Owens come with us?

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:09.925
It's his job
to protect the ladies.

01:17:09.926 --> 01:17:12.294
For all we know, those vampires
are on their way here right now.

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:13.862
Besides, I have a plan.

01:17:13.863 --> 01:17:15.397
- Jack, I need to talk to you.
- What?

01:17:15.398 --> 01:17:16.798
In private.

01:17:16.899 --> 01:17:19.033
- Now?
- Yes, now!

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:20.801
Jesus Christ.

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:26.642
Rosey, I know it's been a rough
day

01:17:26.643 --> 01:17:28.777
but now is not the time
for one of your heart to hearts.

01:17:28.778 --> 01:17:30.444
Anna's your daughter.

01:17:33.716 --> 01:17:34.883
What?

01:17:34.884 --> 01:17:36.685
I was going to tell you one day.

01:17:36.686 --> 01:17:39.219
Her wedding, maybe,
but you need to know now.

01:17:40.056 --> 01:17:41.356
Anna...

01:17:41.357 --> 01:17:43.258
Your little Anna is our...

01:17:43.259 --> 01:17:45.125
my daughter?

01:17:45.128 --> 01:17:47.162
I got pregnant before
you went away to war

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:48.829
and I kept her because...

01:17:49.098 --> 01:17:50.966
because she's ours!

01:17:50.967 --> 01:17:52.901
Why didn't you tell me?

01:17:52.902 --> 01:17:54.870
Because when you got back
from the war you were different.

01:17:54.871 --> 01:17:58.472
You were angry, violent, lost.

01:17:58.675 --> 01:18:01.475
You couldn't handle being
a father and I couldn't risk it.

01:18:01.811 --> 01:18:03.510
Yeah, well...

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:05.746
That's news.

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:14.494
I still would have saved her.
You know that, right?

01:18:15.224 --> 01:18:16.624
Yeah.

01:18:16.726 --> 01:18:18.126
I do know that.

01:18:19.128 --> 01:18:20.462
One other thing, though.

01:18:20.463 --> 01:18:22.763
What? Willie's my son?

01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:26.233
They're vampires.

01:18:26.335 --> 01:18:28.203
Chief and Ramsey
fired their guns

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:29.971
right a Violet, point blank,

01:18:29.972 --> 01:18:32.206
right at her and it did nothing.

01:18:33.176 --> 01:18:34.775
What are you going to do?

01:18:36.746 --> 01:18:38.779
Call in reinforcements.

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:44.618
All great knights are born
from the forge of hell.

01:18:44.921 --> 01:18:47.721
Salvation will soon be yours.

01:18:47.924 --> 01:18:49.057
You sure this is a good idea?

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.892
He's bat-shit crazy.

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:53.095
My dear boy, we are
the last defense of darkness

01:18:53.096 --> 01:18:54.463
shadowing the earth.

01:18:54.464 --> 01:18:56.198
But I told you,
there's nobody in there.

01:18:56.199 --> 01:18:58.166
That's what
they want you to believe.

01:18:58.167 --> 01:19:00.887
This club is just a front
to hide their true residence.

01:19:00.937 --> 01:19:02.137
Maybe they left.

01:19:02.138 --> 01:19:03.405
Anna could be miles from here.

01:19:03.406 --> 01:19:05.440
Daylight is coming soon.

01:19:05.441 --> 01:19:08.310
They wouldn't travel that far
without planning in advanced.

01:19:08.311 --> 01:19:11.279
I can feel it in my soul,
they are here!

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:12.813
This is horseshit.

01:19:12.849 --> 01:19:14.950
They're blood sucking vampires.

01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:16.118
They killed my entire squad.

01:19:16.119 --> 01:19:17.819
Right now, this crazy fuck

01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:19.354
is the only one
who had it right from the start.

01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:21.688
- Thank you, sir.
- Shut up.

01:19:21.991 --> 01:19:23.358
Right now, I'm out of my league.

01:19:23.359 --> 01:19:25.260
So I need all the help
I can get.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:26.895
What about silver bullets?

01:19:26.896 --> 01:19:28.562
That's werewolves.

01:19:28.965 --> 01:19:30.925
- Werewolf.
- Mhm!

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.866
I don't want to know.

01:19:32.969 --> 01:19:34.469
Let's just get Anna
and get the fuck out of here.

01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:35.870
I'm in.

01:19:36.506 --> 01:19:37.539
She's my everything.

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:38.974
How about you, preacher?

01:19:38.975 --> 01:19:41.215
- You in?
- This is my calling.

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:44.513
A sign from god above that I am
here to serve in his mighty...

01:19:44.514 --> 01:19:46.014
I got it. You're in.

01:19:46.015 --> 01:19:49.050
But if we're going to go up
against the supernatural,

01:19:49.051 --> 01:19:51.253
you had better tell me
everything you know

01:19:51.254 --> 01:19:52.521
about killing these things.

01:19:52.522 --> 01:19:54.788
It would be my pleasure.

01:20:00.429 --> 01:20:02.364
Careful,
there's broken glass everywhere.

01:20:02.365 --> 01:20:05.632
Broken glass. I'm a little
more worried about vampires.

01:20:20.449 --> 01:20:22.769
What the hell did you do
that for.

01:20:24.921 --> 01:20:26.453
Never mind.

01:21:22.912 --> 01:21:24.811
I knew it.

01:21:25.448 --> 01:21:27.447
My brothers.

01:21:27.917 --> 01:21:29.384
All great crusaders

01:21:29.385 --> 01:21:31.653
have forged
in the crucible of blood.

01:21:31.654 --> 01:21:34.022
Luther, shut the fuck up.
I'm not in the mood.

01:21:34.023 --> 01:21:38.525
- You've got something on your...
- Shut up.

01:21:45.434 --> 01:21:47.734
Care to open a tab boys?

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:01.415
Nice try, preacher.

01:22:17.166 --> 01:22:20.434
I haven't killed a holy man
in a century.

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:36.483
As I walk through
the shadow of death.

01:22:36.719 --> 01:22:39.553
It's through "The valley
of the shadow of death."

01:23:10.219 --> 01:23:11.619
Holy water.

01:23:13.255 --> 01:23:16.723
Remember to use all the weapons
I gave you.

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:21.995
What is it Luther?

01:23:22.732 --> 01:23:24.132
What?

01:23:25.267 --> 01:23:27.901
I'm trying to think
of a scripture to quote...

01:23:28.637 --> 01:23:30.037
but...

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.506
I got nothing.

01:23:46.522 --> 01:23:49.002
Where the hell
that vamp bitch come from?

01:23:49.358 --> 01:23:51.459
- What about that door?
- This?

01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:53.026
Goes to a loading dock.

01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:56.264
Luther said they'd be
in the building,

01:23:56.265 --> 01:23:57.665
their den!

01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:00.467
I know scofflaws.

01:24:00.503 --> 01:24:03.671
Do you have any idea
how many hidden doors

01:24:03.672 --> 01:24:06.508
and cash boxes
I've scored in my time!

01:24:06.509 --> 01:24:08.676
Okay, "Houdini", surprise me.

01:24:08.677 --> 01:24:10.445
It's prohibition
for Christ's sake!

01:24:10.446 --> 01:24:12.180
All we need to do,

01:24:12.181 --> 01:24:14.815
is find the secret panel,
we find the den.

01:24:15.584 --> 01:24:18.064
This is horse shit!
I'm gonna call someone!

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:19.788
Who you gonna call genius?

01:24:19.789 --> 01:24:22.524
I don't know,
the mayor, the feds, the army.

01:24:22.525 --> 01:24:26.026
The army, really?
The fucking army!

01:24:36.539 --> 01:24:38.638
You first, pretty boy.

01:24:47.650 --> 01:24:50.418
Not the first time I've dealt
with locals.

01:24:50.419 --> 01:24:52.587
Just give it up Chesterfield.

01:24:52.588 --> 01:24:55.155
- The word is out.
- I disagree.

01:24:55.458 --> 01:24:57.425
We chose this town

01:24:57.426 --> 01:25:00.528
just because it's small enough
that no one will notice or care.

01:25:00.529 --> 01:25:02.796
My only problem is you.

01:25:03.232 --> 01:25:05.266
Bullshit, if I can't stop you

01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:07.502
the mayor's just gonna
call in the feds.

01:25:07.503 --> 01:25:09.504
Either way, you're finished.

01:25:09.505 --> 01:25:12.005
Politicians,
it's all about power.

01:25:12.108 --> 01:25:16.109
Your mayor is on my payroll
and a-shoe-in for re-election.

01:25:16.212 --> 01:25:18.780
I only needed
to purge the police.

01:25:18.781 --> 01:25:21.101
This town
and all the people in it

01:25:21.317 --> 01:25:22.484
are mine.

01:25:22.485 --> 01:25:23.852
Where's Ana?

01:25:23.853 --> 01:25:25.553
You son of a bitch!
Give her to me!

01:25:25.554 --> 01:25:28.221
I don't think so.

01:25:39.768 --> 01:25:41.968
I was hoping you'd be here.

01:25:42.204 --> 01:25:44.564
Looking for a little pay back
are we?

01:25:45.474 --> 01:25:47.107
Go find Ana.

01:25:47.243 --> 01:25:49.809
That's right, boy. Go find her.

01:25:50.412 --> 01:25:51.852
I'm getting thirsty.

01:26:09.331 --> 01:26:11.164
Willie!

01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:15.670
Anna?

01:26:16.672 --> 01:26:18.072
I'm over here.

01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:22.644
What did they do to you.

01:26:22.645 --> 01:26:24.210
Alright. I'll free you.

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:25.413
Okay, okay.

01:26:25.414 --> 01:26:28.348
I got you, alright.

01:26:28.450 --> 01:26:30.250
Wait, my arm.

01:26:33.722 --> 01:26:37.023
Shit. Okay, it's alright.

01:26:41.197 --> 01:26:42.796
Brace yourself alright.

01:26:54.543 --> 01:26:57.711
Arggh! You're mine!

01:27:00.616 --> 01:27:02.082
Let go of me.

01:27:04.553 --> 01:27:06.152
Get out of the way!

01:27:27.509 --> 01:27:28.989
It was you in the war.

01:27:29.812 --> 01:27:31.212
In my scope,

01:27:31.714 --> 01:27:33.413
but you're the same.

01:27:34.516 --> 01:27:36.116
You're the sniper.

01:27:38.254 --> 01:27:40.255
For years, I thought I was crazy

01:27:40.256 --> 01:27:42.088
watching you eating those men.

01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:45.318
The years
have not been kind to you.

01:27:45.361 --> 01:27:46.993
You ruined my life.

01:27:50.366 --> 01:27:51.965
You're welcome.

01:28:12.755 --> 01:28:13.721
Holy water!

01:28:13.722 --> 01:28:17.857
Yeah that's a nice trick,
it stings a little.

01:28:18.427 --> 01:28:19.959
But it won't kill me.

01:28:20.029 --> 01:28:21.562
I drive a stake

01:28:21.563 --> 01:28:23.923
through your fucking heart
it will.

01:28:40.649 --> 01:28:42.209
Now look what you've done.

01:28:42.551 --> 01:28:44.250
That's a full week
of harvesting.

01:28:44.386 --> 01:28:46.020
You're gonna pay
for that blood...

01:28:46.021 --> 01:28:47.322
in...

01:28:47.323 --> 01:28:49.889
well, you get the idea.

01:28:52.995 --> 01:28:54.861
How dare you!

01:29:30.466 --> 01:29:32.098
Go, get out of here.

01:29:52.421 --> 01:29:55.789
- Jack's in there.
- Let's go, maybe he got out.

01:29:56.058 --> 01:29:57.924
Chester, run!

01:30:00.596 --> 01:30:02.462
Argh!

01:30:12.508 --> 01:30:14.941
What am I supposed to do
with you two!

01:30:15.677 --> 01:30:17.110
So much promise.

01:30:17.613 --> 01:30:18.946
So young,

01:30:18.947 --> 01:30:20.980
passion...

01:30:20.983 --> 01:30:23.349
I always need new blood.

01:30:23.786 --> 01:30:25.451
Not to drink.

01:30:26.121 --> 01:30:28.288
For my organization.

01:30:28.524 --> 01:30:30.023
Never!

01:30:36.865 --> 01:30:38.699
Now you did it!

01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.802
You got me angry!

01:30:40.803 --> 01:30:42.535
Shit!

01:30:43.672 --> 01:30:45.839
We can talk about this.

01:30:48.744 --> 01:30:50.610
I don't think he wants to talk.

01:30:59.455 --> 01:31:00.955
Fool!

01:31:00.956 --> 01:31:03.124
I will trine
in the dust of your corpses

01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:05.760
long after your names
are forgotten.

01:31:05.761 --> 01:31:08.261
I am immortal.

01:31:33.155 --> 01:31:35.455
Not all of you is immortal.
