20:54.862 --> 20:57.430
weren't going to get
Reagan through this.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.083
[tense music]

20:59.214 --> 21:02.086
Three separate investigations
were announced.

21:02.217 --> 21:04.088
First, there was
the Tower Commission,

21:04.219 --> 21:06.700
a three-person panel
focused on finding out

21:06.830 --> 21:08.789
what went wrong
in the White House.

21:08.919 --> 21:10.965
Also, a team of prosecutors

21:11.095 --> 21:13.141
in the Office
of the Independent Counsel

21:13.272 --> 21:15.665
began a criminal probe.

21:15.796 --> 21:18.581
At the same time, Congress
prepared for public hearings.

21:20.714 --> 21:24.065
I'm Pamela Naughton,
and I was assistant counsel

21:24.195 --> 21:27.764
to the Select House Committee
on Iran-Contra.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.636
When I was growing up,

21:29.766 --> 21:31.681
we watched
the Watergate hearings.

21:31.812 --> 21:34.597
Once the administration admitted

21:34.728 --> 21:36.686
that there had been
a diversion to the Contras,

21:36.817 --> 21:39.863
I just had a feeling
I would be part of it.

21:39.994 --> 21:42.953
We actually worked in the attic
of the U.S. Capitol building.

21:43.084 --> 21:45.042
[Neyfakh]
The attic allowed Naughton

21:45.173 --> 21:47.523
and the other investigators
to set up a temporary SCIF,

21:47.654 --> 21:49.046
a restricted area designed

21:49.177 --> 21:51.005
to keep classified
information secret.

21:51.135 --> 21:53.877
[Naughton] The SCIF
was like working in a cave.

21:54.008 --> 21:55.575
And I have to confess,
once in a while,

21:55.705 --> 21:57.446
we'd sneak up to the roof
and sunbathe.

21:57.577 --> 21:59.013
[chuckles]

21:59.143 --> 22:01.711
And now I imagine
you can't do that anymore.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.974
[Neyfakh] The committees
quickly ran into a roadblock

22:04.105 --> 22:05.889
when key people
in the investigation

22:06.020 --> 22:08.022
began pleading the Fifth.

22:08.152 --> 22:10.503
Oliver North and John
Poindexter, among others,

22:10.633 --> 22:11.939
refused to cooperate

22:12.069 --> 22:13.941
without being
granted immunity,

22:14.071 --> 22:15.769
which would make
anything they said

22:15.899 --> 22:17.727
in the congressional
investigation off-limits

22:17.858 --> 22:19.729
in the criminal proceedings.

22:19.860 --> 22:22.732
There are about 13 charges

22:22.863 --> 22:25.822
of obstruction of investigation

22:25.953 --> 22:27.911
and false statements.

22:28.782 --> 22:31.785
[Neyfakh] Ultimately, Congress
did grant the men immunity

22:31.915 --> 22:33.830
in exchange
for their testimony.

22:33.961 --> 22:36.050
The agreement meant
they would fully cooperate

22:36.180 --> 22:38.487
and also that they would turn
over any documentation

22:38.618 --> 22:40.228
or recordings they had,

22:40.359 --> 22:43.100
including whatever remained
of Oliver North's notes.

22:43.231 --> 22:45.886
[Naughton] He was
a prodigious note-taker.

22:46.016 --> 22:48.889
When the notebooks arrived,
that was a very, very big deal.

22:49.019 --> 22:51.326
And we made copies
immediately,

22:51.457 --> 22:53.763
and everybody started
reading them.

22:53.894 --> 22:56.157
[Neyfakh] Although the three
investigations ran separately,

22:56.287 --> 22:58.768
each one produced reams
of evidence

22:58.899 --> 23:00.857
that together pointed
to a very different reality

23:00.988 --> 23:02.642
than what the White House

23:02.772 --> 23:04.470
had been selling
to the American public.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.820
The big bombshell

23:06.950 --> 23:08.822
that the Tower Commission
came up with

23:08.952 --> 23:10.824
was the discovery

23:10.954 --> 23:14.523
of John Poindexter's
deleted email files--

23:14.654 --> 23:16.786
over 5,000 emails deleted.

23:16.917 --> 23:18.658
And you can see
the records nowadays

23:18.788 --> 23:22.705
where, you know,
let's say, November 25th,

23:22.836 --> 23:27.580
at 1:00 in the morning,
he had 5,200 emails.

23:27.710 --> 23:28.972
November 25th, later in the day,

23:29.103 --> 23:31.758
after the press conference,
zero emails.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.368
[chuckles]

23:33.499 --> 23:36.153
And that broke
the scandal wide open.

23:36.937 --> 23:39.113
[Neyfakh] The messages
showed that Oliver North

23:39.243 --> 23:42.072
had communicated
with Poindexter at every step.

23:42.203 --> 23:45.902
That brought the whole fiasco
one step closer to Reagan.

23:46.033 --> 23:48.122
Because John Poindexter
and Oliver North

23:48.252 --> 23:50.124
had pleaded the Fifth,
the Tower Commission

23:50.254 --> 23:52.909
wasn't able to meet
with them for interviews.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.172
But on several occasions,
the commission did meet

23:55.303 --> 23:57.087
with the president himself.

23:57.218 --> 23:59.002
[Byrne] This proved
to be a turning point also

23:59.133 --> 24:02.571
because Reagan's story
changed over time.

24:02.702 --> 24:04.094
He said, basically,

24:04.225 --> 24:07.663
"I was aware of
and I authorized the Israelis

24:07.794 --> 24:11.014
to participate in this--
in these arms deals."

24:11.145 --> 24:14.017
Later on,
just a couple weeks later,

24:14.148 --> 24:15.802
he claimed that
he didn't know anything

24:15.932 --> 24:17.194
about what had happened.

24:17.325 --> 24:19.588
So, how do you resolve this?

24:19.719 --> 24:21.285
[man] Last month,

24:21.416 --> 24:23.157
the president's statement
to the board agreed

24:23.287 --> 24:24.724
with McFarlane's,
but after a number of meetings

24:24.854 --> 24:26.290
with Chief of Staff
Donald Regan,

24:26.421 --> 24:28.162
the president told the board
he was mistaken

24:28.292 --> 24:30.294
and hadn't given approval
until much later.

24:30.425 --> 24:33.776
[Kuhn] We knew it was
going to scar Reagan,

24:33.907 --> 24:35.604
that he would have
this indelible

24:35.735 --> 24:38.868
Iran-Contra scar forever.

24:38.999 --> 24:41.131
It was something
that I was very upset about,

24:41.262 --> 24:44.308
knowing that it hurt him,
that it set him back.

24:44.439 --> 24:45.919
[Neyfakh] Questions
increasingly focused

24:46.049 --> 24:47.964
on whether Reagan knew
about North

24:48.095 --> 24:50.097
diverting proceeds
from the Iran deal

24:50.227 --> 24:52.186
to the Contras in Nicaragua.

24:52.316 --> 24:55.232
There were people in Congress
talking about impeachment

24:55.363 --> 24:59.019
if it had been found that
Ronald Reagan's fingerprints

24:59.149 --> 25:01.978
were on that
flagrantly illegal deal.

25:02.109 --> 25:04.328
He's caught
between that dilemma

25:04.459 --> 25:07.201
of either being accused
of having known

25:07.331 --> 25:08.985
or being accused
of having not known.

25:09.116 --> 25:12.946
Whichever it was is bound
to lead to some criticism.

25:13.990 --> 25:17.037
[Neyfakh] Bud McFarlane
struggled with the accusations.

25:17.167 --> 25:19.126
[Teicher] McFarlane was
under intense pressure

25:19.256 --> 25:22.521
as the scandal unfolded.

25:22.651 --> 25:26.220
He was a lifelong servant
of the government,

25:26.350 --> 25:29.702
in the military, the Congress,
and the executive branch,

25:29.832 --> 25:31.268
suddenly being vilified

25:31.399 --> 25:34.794
as someone who might
bring down the president.

25:34.924 --> 25:37.884
This was how
everything was cast.

25:38.014 --> 25:39.973
What we had done

25:40.103 --> 25:43.150
could cost Ronald Reagan
his presidency.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.760
♪

25:44.891 --> 25:48.198
I reached the conclusion

25:48.329 --> 25:52.202
that, at least,
if you can't turn things around,

25:52.333 --> 25:56.990
maybe you can atone
for what's happened here

25:57.120 --> 25:59.732
by acknowledging
your own role in it

25:59.862 --> 26:01.211
and your failure in it.

26:01.342 --> 26:03.039
[Neyfakh]
Before he was to meet

26:03.170 --> 26:05.215
with the Tower Commission
for his third interview,

26:05.346 --> 26:07.957
McFarlane grew
increasingly desperate.

26:09.176 --> 26:12.179
He drafted letters
to his wife, to his lawyer,

26:12.309 --> 26:13.833
and to members of the House

26:13.963 --> 26:16.096
and Senate
Intelligence Committees.

26:16.226 --> 26:18.838
Then he swallowed
at least 20 pills of Valium.

26:18.968 --> 26:20.100
One of the most
important figures

26:20.230 --> 26:21.884
in the Iran-Contra affair,

26:22.015 --> 26:23.973
Robert McFarlane,
is in a hospital tonight.

26:24.104 --> 26:25.801
The former
national security advisor

26:25.932 --> 26:27.498
apparently took
an overdose of Valium,

26:27.629 --> 26:30.893
a tranquilizer often prescribed
to ease stress and anxiety.

26:31.024 --> 26:33.113
[McFarlane] It was foolish,
looking back,

26:33.243 --> 26:36.203
but it's just
more a comment

26:36.333 --> 26:39.467
on how deep
the depression had become.

26:39.598 --> 26:43.036
And I won't develop for you
the nature of depression

26:43.166 --> 26:45.168
and how it develops
and how it can worsen

26:45.299 --> 26:47.910
and lead to a cycle
of decline.

26:48.041 --> 26:51.044
And yet, that was
what was happening.

26:51.174 --> 26:54.917
It was very, very,
very hard for him.

26:55.048 --> 26:58.921
And as some people say,
there are some people

26:59.052 --> 27:02.925
who bend under pressure
and some who break.

27:03.056 --> 27:06.233
And at a certain point,
Bud broke,

27:06.363 --> 27:08.757
and it led him
to try to commit suicide.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.977
And I understand that.

27:12.152 --> 27:14.371
[McFarlane] Those
who were involved, sure,

27:14.502 --> 27:17.026
they all bear a measure
of responsibility.

27:17.157 --> 27:18.288
But they weren't
decision-makers.

in that administration

27:25.034 --> 27:26.296
on national security affairs,

27:26.427 --> 27:28.995
it did so because
I had approved it,

27:29.125 --> 27:30.997
I had recommended it,

27:31.127 --> 27:34.261
and the president had approved
what I had urged.

27:34.391 --> 27:37.960
I could only atone
from here on out

27:38.091 --> 27:39.919
by being honest
and telling the truth

On February 28, 1987,

27:46.577 --> 27:49.450
Reagan's long-time
speechwriter, Landon Parvin,

27:49.580 --> 27:51.365
drove through the back gates
of the White House

27:51.495 --> 27:53.106
towards the East Wing.

27:53.236 --> 27:54.847
In his briefcase,
he had secreted

27:54.977 --> 27:56.457
a thickly bound packet,

27:56.587 --> 27:58.372
covered with his own
underlines and notes

27:58.502 --> 28:01.157
from interviews he had done
with Reagan's staff.

28:01.288 --> 28:02.898
My name is Landon Parvin,

and I was
a Reagan speechwriter.

28:05.422 --> 28:07.207
[Neyfakh] Parvin had
the reputation of someone

28:07.337 --> 28:10.166
who could write a politician
out of any tough bind.

28:10.297 --> 28:13.082
Iran-Contra was a job
for Landon Parvin.

28:13.213 --> 28:15.084
I definitely felt
it was a crisis.

28:15.215 --> 28:16.956
You could feel it on the news.

28:17.086 --> 28:18.348
You could feel it

The president
did make mistakes.

28:33.494 --> 28:35.235
[Neyfakh] Nancy Reagan
had set up a secret meeting

to craft her husband's
public response.

Going into that Friday meeting,
he looked upset.

28:45.158 --> 28:47.203
He looked shaken.

28:47.334 --> 28:51.120
You know, he usually had
an ebullience about him,

28:51.251 --> 28:53.906
but I didn't detect that.

28:54.036 --> 28:55.429
He was dressed very casually.

28:55.559 --> 28:59.346
He was in a--he was
in a running suit, I think.

28:59.476 --> 29:02.523
The casualness of his dress

29:02.653 --> 29:06.135
belied, I think,
how seriously he was taking it.

29:07.484 --> 29:10.357
John Tower was very direct,

29:10.487 --> 29:15.057
and the big question

29:15.188 --> 29:18.974
was whether
the president could admit

29:19.105 --> 29:22.195
he traded arms for hostages.

Everyone said he had--

talk of impeachment.

So this was not something

In 300 sobering pages,

sharply criticized

29:41.127 --> 29:43.042
the Reagan administration.

29:43.172 --> 29:44.434

were accused

of hiding information
from Congress

29:46.654 --> 29:48.482

to adequately convey

to the president the risks

how to say it

I figured out the psychology

to accept something
he didn't want to accept.

30:33.527 --> 30:35.485

31:02.251 --> 31:04.210
practically everyone
on Reagan's team

31:04.340 --> 31:06.865
would lay out their version
of events under oath.

31:06.995 --> 31:08.518
It would be up
to the public to decipher

31:08.649 --> 31:10.694
if what they were
saying was true.

31:10.825 --> 31:13.393
Good evening. Throughout
the Iran-Contra affair,

31:13.523 --> 31:15.351
a central question has been--

31:15.482 --> 31:17.658
what did President Reagan know
and when did he know it?

31:17.788 --> 31:20.530
[man] 29 remotely controlled
still cameras

31:20.661 --> 31:22.402
will record the scene

31:22.532 --> 31:25.231
as will every television
network in America.

31:25.361 --> 31:28.277
[Neyfakh] In May of 1987,
the world tuned in to watch

31:28.408 --> 31:31.237
the joint House
and Senate hearings.

31:31.367 --> 31:32.368
By now, interest
in the scandal

31:32.499 --> 31:34.109
was at a fever pitch.

31:34.240 --> 31:35.589
[man] The line to get

31:35.719 --> 31:37.243
into the Senate Russell
Building Caucus Room

31:37.373 --> 31:39.419
was early and long.

31:39.549 --> 31:42.161
This is an historic moment.
It's like Watergate.

31:42.291 --> 31:44.250
[Naughton]
The Senate hearings were

31:44.380 --> 31:45.468
in the big Caucus Room.

31:45.599 --> 31:47.775
People will recognize it

31:47.906 --> 31:51.039
because it has the big
high-back chairs in the back.

31:51.170 --> 31:52.432
Very ornate.

31:52.562 --> 31:55.391
It was a spectacle.

31:55.522 --> 31:57.567
[man] The joint hearings of
the House Select Committee

31:57.698 --> 31:59.656
to investigate covert
arms transactions

31:59.787 --> 32:02.529
with Iran will come to order.

32:02.659 --> 32:04.357
[Naughton]
Normally, in a courtroom,

32:04.487 --> 32:07.229
you're within ten feet
of the witness box.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.492
You can have a dialogue
with the witness,

32:09.623 --> 32:12.234
and it's unobstructed.

32:12.365 --> 32:14.715
When you're in Congress,
you're up on this dais,

32:14.845 --> 32:17.239
the witness is down
in the well,

32:17.370 --> 32:19.633
and there's 50 photographers
between you,

32:19.763 --> 32:22.810
and they're constantly
snapping like little birds.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.594
[camera shutters snapping]

32:24.725 --> 32:27.423
They're crawling around
and walking around,

32:27.554 --> 32:30.470
and people are going in and out
of the hearing room.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.473
We had demonstrators.
We had people holding signs.

32:33.603 --> 32:35.562
[man] Why don't you ask him
about how many noncombatants

32:35.692 --> 32:38.304
have been killed
by this putrid--?

32:38.434 --> 32:40.436
It's an almost
impossible forum

32:40.567 --> 32:42.525
in which to find the facts.

32:42.656 --> 32:45.267
Mr. Secord,
will you please rise?

32:45.398 --> 32:47.226
[Neyfakh] First to testify
was Richard Secord.

32:47.356 --> 32:49.358
Remember him?

32:49.489 --> 32:51.621
He had managed the logistics
of the Iran arms sales

32:51.752 --> 32:53.493
and the resupply operation
to the Contras.

32:53.623 --> 32:55.277
Do you swear to tell
the truth,

32:55.408 --> 32:56.844
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

32:56.975 --> 32:58.759
-so help you God?
-I do.

32:58.889 --> 33:00.543
[Neyfakh] Secord agreed
to testify without immunity,

33:00.674 --> 33:02.719
which meant that
anything he said

33:02.850 --> 33:04.634
could be used against him
in the criminal investigation.

33:04.765 --> 33:07.333
[Secord] My lawyer thought
I was insane

33:07.463 --> 33:09.639
for insisting on doing that.

33:10.379 --> 33:13.992
Am I correct, Mr. Secord,
that you were engaged

33:14.122 --> 33:17.125
in selling arms
to the Contras for profit?

33:18.213 --> 33:19.823
That's correct.

33:19.954 --> 33:21.521
[Secord] My position was

33:21.651 --> 33:24.350
if we allow the others
to go first,

33:24.480 --> 33:27.614
after they grant immunity,
the storyline will be set,

33:27.744 --> 33:30.399
and we'll never
recover from it.

33:30.530 --> 33:32.793
Did you testify yesterday

33:32.923 --> 33:35.752
that you directed your
secretary to shred documents?

33:35.883 --> 33:37.580
Didn't you tell us
also you had wanted

33:37.711 --> 33:39.191
to talk to the president
of the United States?

33:39.321 --> 33:40.279
Was it ever contemplated

33:40.409 --> 33:42.455
that you would obtain profits

33:42.585 --> 33:44.631
or any other kind
of remuneration

33:44.761 --> 33:46.285
in connection
with the Iranian initiative?

33:46.415 --> 33:47.677
No. None.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.418
I have no idea, sir.
I don't remember.

33:49.549 --> 33:50.811
There are some deeply
troubling aspects

33:50.941 --> 33:52.856
to your testimony,
and I guess that's the point

33:52.987 --> 33:55.424
of the hard questions
that have been posed.

33:55.555 --> 33:58.775
A couple of the attorneys
harassed me

33:58.906 --> 34:01.430
until I thought
I couldn't stand it.

34:01.561 --> 34:04.868
But I'm glad we did it that way.

34:04.999 --> 34:07.306
We got a special prosecutor
over here across the street

34:07.436 --> 34:09.003
that's trying to throw
all of us in jail

34:09.134 --> 34:11.353
for performing our duty
as we saw it.

34:11.484 --> 34:13.442
I haven't focused
on some technical issue

34:13.573 --> 34:15.357
like you're bringing up here.
This is crazy.

34:17.794 --> 34:20.493
[Neyfakh] Secord's defiant,
unapologetic testimony

34:20.623 --> 34:22.712
set the tone
for what was to come--

34:22.843 --> 34:27.108
testy exchanges with counsel
and bombshell revelations.

34:27.239 --> 34:30.198
The following week,
Bud McFarlane took the stand.

34:30.329 --> 34:31.895
-I do.
-Thank you.

34:32.026 --> 34:34.333
[Neyfakh] And he too spoke
without immunity.

34:34.463 --> 34:37.336
To have done nothing,
while safe,

34:37.466 --> 34:38.946
would have been
irresponsible.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.861
That there are many other
issues that are of great--

34:40.991 --> 34:42.689
-Senate House Committee--
-Democracy.

34:42.819 --> 34:43.646
More than
the legal argument--

34:43.777 --> 34:45.344
Their policies with--

34:45.474 --> 34:46.519
Is this the first
you ever heard

34:46.649 --> 34:49.696
of a November 1985
Hawk shipment?

34:49.826 --> 34:52.655
I do believe it was.

34:52.786 --> 34:55.310
[Naughton]
I was the lead interrogator

34:55.441 --> 34:57.704
at the hearings
for Chuck Cooper.

34:57.834 --> 35:00.359
I had to prepare
the testimony,

35:00.489 --> 35:02.752
and in order
that I could concentrate,

35:02.883 --> 35:04.711
the chairman
of the Judiciary Committee

35:04.841 --> 35:07.844
let me use his private office.

35:07.975 --> 35:10.934
I wanted to do a good job,
and he's trying to buck me up,

35:11.065 --> 35:13.720
and he says, "You know,
I just wanna tell you,"

35:13.850 --> 35:16.592
he says, "You're gonna be
the first woman lawyer ever

35:16.723 --> 35:18.681
"to ask a question

35:18.812 --> 35:22.120
"at any congressional--
major congressional hearing.

35:23.686 --> 35:26.733
Think about that.
I know you can do it."

35:26.863 --> 35:28.256
Well, that wasn't
exactly helping.

35:28.387 --> 35:29.518
[laughing]

35:29.649 --> 35:31.346
Our first witness
this morning

35:31.477 --> 35:33.740
will be Mr. Charles Cooper.

35:33.870 --> 35:36.525
[Naughton]
When we got to the testimony

35:36.656 --> 35:39.876
and Chairman Inouye called
on me to start the questioning,

35:40.007 --> 35:42.488
he referred to me
as Mr. Naughton.

35:42.618 --> 35:44.533
[Inouye]
Mr. Naughton?

35:44.664 --> 35:46.840
Oh, Ms. Naughton.
I'm sorry.

35:46.970 --> 35:49.364
I almost wanted to say,
"Thank you, Ms. Chairman,"

35:49.495 --> 35:51.453
but I decided not to do that.

35:51.584 --> 35:53.760
-Good morning, Mr. Cooper.
-Good morning.

35:53.890 --> 35:58.547
Mr. Cooper, did you have
any knowledge of U.S. sales

35:58.678 --> 36:03.552
of military equipment to Iran
prior to November 1986?

36:03.683 --> 36:05.467
I did not.

36:05.598 --> 36:07.600
In a congressional
investigation,

36:07.730 --> 36:10.211
there are essentially
no rules.

36:10.342 --> 36:12.822
There's no judge who's gonna
discipline the witness

36:12.953 --> 36:16.391
and/or his lawyer
because nobody hit the gavel

36:16.522 --> 36:18.045
and said that
you're out of order.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.352
Once you ask your question,

36:20.482 --> 36:22.963
they can go talk
about the moon

36:23.093 --> 36:25.618
or the sun and the stars,
and you have no control.

36:25.748 --> 36:28.534
Did anyone else in the room
during that meeting

36:28.664 --> 36:32.668
mention CIA involvement
in the 1985 Hawk shipment?

36:32.799 --> 36:35.541
Uh, I am drawing a blank
from my memory.

36:35.671 --> 36:39.371
If I could consult the notes
I took at that meeting--

36:39.501 --> 36:41.416
It's very frustrating.

36:41.547 --> 36:43.070
Thank you very much,
Mr. Cooper.

36:43.201 --> 36:46.813
Mr. Chairman, that ends
my examination of the witness.

36:46.943 --> 36:50.817
The hearing will please
come to order.

36:50.947 --> 36:53.515
[Neyfakh] While the hearings
dominated the airwaves,

36:53.646 --> 36:56.039
the president himself
ignored the coverage.

36:56.170 --> 36:59.478
We were in Italy in 1987

36:59.608 --> 37:02.916
for the economic summit,
the G7.

37:03.046 --> 37:05.484
We had a break,
and we went back to our hotel,

37:05.614 --> 37:06.833
said,
"Hey, we've got some time.

37:06.963 --> 37:08.661
You want to put
the hearings on?"

37:08.791 --> 37:10.750
He said, "Sure.
Let's see what's going on."

37:10.880 --> 37:12.578
He was probably everybody's--

37:12.708 --> 37:14.797
every secretary's
dream of a boss.

37:14.928 --> 37:16.843
[Kuhn]
Fawn Hall was testifying,

37:16.973 --> 37:19.846
and Reagan's looking at her,
and I'm looking at her.

37:19.976 --> 37:21.891
And Reagan said to me--
he looked at me and he said,

37:22.022 --> 37:24.720
"Jim," he said,
"So that's who Fawn Hall is."

37:24.851 --> 37:26.722
And I said, "Yeah."

37:26.853 --> 37:28.681
I said, "I wouldn't
have known her either."

37:28.811 --> 37:31.031
It's the eve
of the Oliver North testimony,

37:31.161 --> 37:33.076
and there is
great anticipation,

37:33.207 --> 37:36.036
but no advance word
on what he will say.

37:36.166 --> 37:37.603
[man] North's four days
of testimony

37:37.733 --> 37:39.561
should be a climactic moment,

37:39.692 --> 37:40.997
when the committee begins
getting answers

37:41.128 --> 37:42.695
to some of the key questions.

37:42.825 --> 37:44.653
North's long-awaited
public testimony

37:44.784 --> 37:46.264
begins tomorrow morning.

37:46.394 --> 37:48.831
[Inouye] The hearing will
please come to order.

37:48.962 --> 37:51.704
[Neyfakh] Once Oliver North
was granted criminal immunity,

37:51.834 --> 37:54.010
he finally appeared
before the committee.

37:54.141 --> 37:56.099
The world was eager to hear

37:56.230 --> 37:58.885
whether he had received
approval from the president,

37:59.015 --> 38:01.583
whether he had personally
profited from the deals,

38:01.714 --> 38:04.499
and how he had carried out
the cover-up.

38:04.630 --> 38:06.284
Colonel North, please rise.

38:06.414 --> 38:09.591
Oliver North took hold
of that proceeding

38:09.722 --> 38:11.767
and made it his own.

38:11.898 --> 38:14.553
He came dressed
in his full uniform

38:14.683 --> 38:15.858
with his medals.

38:15.989 --> 38:18.731
[Inouye]
Do you solemnly swear...

38:18.861 --> 38:21.777
He just looked like this
red-blooded American hero.

38:21.908 --> 38:24.737
-I do.
-Please be seated.

38:24.867 --> 38:27.000
[McManus] Usually,
congressional investigators

38:27.130 --> 38:29.872
expect a witness before them

38:30.003 --> 38:33.963
to be contrite
or perhaps evasive.

38:34.094 --> 38:37.489
But Ollie North
turned the tables on them

38:37.619 --> 38:39.752
by going on the offense.

38:39.882 --> 38:42.624
I believe that this is
a strange process

38:42.755 --> 38:43.973
that you are putting me
and others through.

38:44.104 --> 38:45.975
Thousands of hours
of testimony.

38:46.106 --> 38:47.499
You make the rulings
as to what is proper

38:47.629 --> 38:48.978
and what is not proper.

38:49.109 --> 38:50.937
From where I sit,
it is not the fairest process.

38:51.067 --> 38:53.113
Plain and simple,
the Congress is to blame

38:53.243 --> 38:55.768
because of the fickle,
vacillating,

38:55.898 --> 38:59.075
unpredictable,
on-again-off-again policy

38:59.206 --> 39:01.556
toward the Nicaraguan
Democratic Resistance.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.079
[McManus]
And the poor members

39:03.210 --> 39:05.647
of the congressional committee

39:05.778 --> 39:08.868
didn't quite know
what they were up against.

39:08.998 --> 39:11.479
-Lieutenant--
-First of all,

39:11.610 --> 39:13.002
I'm a Lieutenant Colonel.

39:13.133 --> 39:14.569
I have been
a Lieutenant Colonel

39:14.700 --> 39:17.224
for a couple of years now.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.575
The government of the United
States gave me a shredder.

39:20.706 --> 39:21.924
I mean, I didn't buy it myself.

39:22.055 --> 39:23.796
I did not discuss this

39:23.926 --> 39:25.754
with the attorney general
until January.

39:25.885 --> 39:27.756
It wasn't some
secret Ollie North

39:27.887 --> 39:29.671
in the middle of the night,
flying off on his own hook.

39:29.802 --> 39:31.107
Ollie North didn't do that.

39:31.238 --> 39:32.892
You're misunderstanding
what I said.

39:33.022 --> 39:34.023
[Neyfakh]
With the Vietnam War

39:34.154 --> 39:36.025
still a recent memory,

39:36.156 --> 39:38.027
the former marine
facing a majority

39:38.158 --> 39:40.813
Democrat congress
reignited old tensions.

39:40.943 --> 39:43.816
Would that have made
a difference?

39:43.946 --> 39:45.948
You're the person
who surfaced it.

39:46.079 --> 39:47.950
Don't get angry, counsel.

39:48.081 --> 39:49.691
I'm gonna answer
your question.

39:49.822 --> 39:50.866
[Byrne]
That came off even better

39:50.997 --> 39:52.694
when you put him across

39:52.825 --> 39:54.348
from the House lead counsel,
John Nields,

39:54.479 --> 39:56.002
who was this kind
of hippy-looking guy,

39:56.132 --> 39:58.613
with hair down
to his shoulders.

39:58.744 --> 39:59.875
This is the culture wars,

40:00.006 --> 40:01.877
you know,
embodied in these two people.

40:02.008 --> 40:04.184
-Where are these memoranda?
-Which memoranda?

40:04.314 --> 40:05.925
[Nields]
The memoranda that you sent up

40:06.055 --> 40:08.057
seeking
