00:07.602 --> 00:09.001
Shane Smith: <i>This week on</i> Vice:

00:09.037 --> 00:12.554
<i>The amazing medical breakthroughs
that are happening in Cuba.</i>

00:14.140 --> 00:17.195
Kelvin Lee: You go from
this discernible tumor,

00:17.220 --> 00:19.611
and then after the vaccine,

00:19.646 --> 00:22.714
that's all cleared out.
It's really quite dramatic.

00:22.749 --> 00:25.116
Gianna Toboni: <i>This hospital
treats people with diabetes,</i>

00:25.151 --> 00:27.806
<i>and they have a new drug
that could eliminate 70%</i>

00:27.831 --> 00:30.298
<i>of the diabetes-related amputations.</i>

00:30.323 --> 00:32.656
Smith: <i>And then, the ecological threat</i>

00:32.692 --> 00:35.593
<i>to one of the world's
most popular foods.</i>

00:35.628 --> 00:38.145
Isobel Yeung: How long has this
been infected for, do you think?

00:38.170 --> 00:40.068
<i>Months. Once you see it,</i>

00:40.093 --> 00:42.032
<i>you're really very, very late.</i>

00:48.638 --> 00:50.073
Yeung: Go, go, go!

00:53.211 --> 00:54.410
Refugee: We are not animals!

01:05.961 --> 01:07.555
In 2016,

01:07.591 --> 01:10.107
Barack Obama became the
first sitting U.S. president

01:10.132 --> 01:12.360
to visit Cuba in nearly 90 years.

01:12.395 --> 01:14.963
I have come here to bury

01:14.999 --> 01:18.629
the last remnant of the
Cold War in the Americas.

01:18.654 --> 01:20.700
Smith: <i>The shift
towards normalizing ties</i>

01:20.737 --> 01:21.969
<i>between the two countries</i>

01:22.005 --> 01:25.372
<i>saw the loosening of trade
and travel restrictions.</i>

01:25.407 --> 01:27.041
But what many people don't know,

01:27.076 --> 01:28.208
is that the thaw in relations

01:28.244 --> 01:30.210
<i>could also allow Americans access</i>

01:30.246 --> 01:32.747
<i>to hitherto inaccessible Cuban medicines</i>

01:32.782 --> 01:34.279
<i>that may transform the treatment</i>

01:34.304 --> 01:37.416
of some of our most widespread
and harmful diseases.

02:06.847 --> 02:08.746
It's so funny the doctor walked in just,

02:08.782 --> 02:10.080
you know, less than a minute ago,

02:10.116 --> 02:11.182
and she's already taken the...

02:11.217 --> 02:12.593
the baby's heartbeat.

02:12.618 --> 02:15.186
<i>Dr. Sara Gonzalez is a family doctor</i>

02:15.221 --> 02:16.788
<i>in this Havana neighborhood.</i>

02:16.823 --> 02:18.422
<i>She and her team walk door to door</i>

02:18.457 --> 02:20.024
<i>to check in on her patients.</i>

02:33.033 --> 02:34.137
Toboni: <i>These neighborhood doctors</i>

02:34.173 --> 02:36.339
<i>are central to the
Cuban healthcare system.</i>

02:36.374 --> 02:38.017
Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi.

02:38.043 --> 02:39.759
<i>Toboni: Checking in door
to door allows doctors</i>

02:39.784 --> 02:41.678
<i>to focus on preventive medicine</i>

02:41.714 --> 02:43.979
<i>by catching and treating
diseases earlier,</i>

02:44.015 --> 02:45.234
<i>keeping costs low,</i>

02:45.259 --> 02:46.982
<i>and contributing to longevity.</i>

02:54.125 --> 02:56.812
Toboni: <i>Life expectancy here
matches that of the U.S.,</i>

02:56.837 --> 02:58.527
<i>while Cuba spends less than a tenth</i>

02:58.562 --> 03:00.479
<i>of what we spend on
healthcare per capita.</i>

03:20.415 --> 03:23.183
Toboni: <i>While most of Cuba may
look like it's stuck in the 1950s,</i>

03:23.219 --> 03:25.252
<i>their medicine is not.</i>

03:28.791 --> 03:30.958
Toboni: <i>Cuba boasts
more doctors per capita</i>

03:30.993 --> 03:32.392
<i>than anyone else in the world.</i>

03:32.427 --> 03:35.161
<i>Their infant mortality rate
is better than the U.S.,</i>

03:35.196 --> 03:38.063
<i>and when the Ebola
crisis broke out in 2014,</i>

03:38.088 --> 03:39.999
<i>they sent more doctors to Africa</i>

03:40.034 --> 03:41.782
<i>than any other nation.</i>

03:42.751 --> 03:44.470
<i>As a small Communist country,</i>

03:44.505 --> 03:47.273
<i>their healthcare system
was built out of necessity.</i>

03:47.308 --> 03:50.309
<i>First, the 1963 trade
embargo restricted Cuba</i>

03:50.344 --> 03:52.543
<i>from importing medicines from the U.S.,</i>

03:52.579 --> 03:54.146
<i>and then in the early '90s,</i>

03:54.181 --> 03:55.847
<i>their economic isolation worsened</i>

03:55.883 --> 03:58.183
<i>with the collapse of the Soviet Union.</i>

03:58.218 --> 04:00.585
<i>These unique conditions
furthered the need</i>

04:00.620 --> 04:02.314
<i>to develop their own advancements,</i>

04:02.339 --> 04:05.056
<i>driving them to the forefront
of medical innovation</i>

04:05.092 --> 04:07.292
<i>and inexpensive treatments.</i>

04:10.736 --> 04:12.890
This hospital treats
people with diabetes,

04:12.915 --> 04:15.800
and they have a new drug that they're
administering called Heberprot,

04:15.835 --> 04:17.902
and the reason it's a
really great drug is because

04:17.937 --> 04:20.060
based on clinical trials,
they say it could eliminate

04:20.084 --> 04:23.774
70% of the diabetes-related amputations.

04:25.076 --> 04:27.576
Toboni: <i>Diabetes is a
serious epidemic in Cuba,</i>

04:27.612 --> 04:29.012
<i>just like in the U.S.,</i>

04:29.047 --> 04:32.246
<i>but doctors here have created a
new, highly effective treatment</i>

04:32.271 --> 04:35.951
<i>that manages one of the disease's
most dangerous complications:</i>

04:35.976 --> 04:38.060
<i>Foot ulcers.</i>

04:46.928 --> 04:48.864
Toboni: <i>Dr. Jose Fernandez Montequin</i>

04:48.899 --> 04:50.532
<i>is a diabetes specialist.</i>

04:50.567 --> 04:53.576
Can you just explain
what's happening today?

05:02.011 --> 05:04.870
Toboni: <i>Heberprot-P is injected
around the site of the ulcer,</i>

05:04.895 --> 05:06.427
<i>stimulating tissue growth</i>

05:06.452 --> 05:07.901
<i>so the foot can start to heal.</i>

05:17.261 --> 05:18.885
<i>Toboni: Hundreds of
thousands of patients</i>

05:18.910 --> 05:21.744
<i>in more than 20 countries
have avoided losing limbs,</i>

05:21.769 --> 05:25.276
<i>and in some cases, their
lives, thanks to Heberprot-P.</i>

05:25.301 --> 05:26.884
When someone receives an amputation,

05:26.909 --> 05:28.775
how does that affect
their life expectancy?

05:37.651 --> 05:39.956
So this treatment isn't
just preventing amputations,

05:39.981 --> 05:41.420
it's actually saving lives.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.159
Toboni: <i>Despite this
drug's impressive results,</i>

05:47.194 --> 05:50.494
<i>the U.S., a country with 30 million
people living with diabetes,</i>

05:50.530 --> 05:52.589
<i>is the one place that won't accept it</i>

05:52.614 --> 05:55.745
<i>due to its own
longstanding trade embargo.</i>

05:57.570 --> 05:59.270
<i>And it's not just medicines.</i>

05:59.306 --> 06:02.405
<i>All Cuban products have been
banned for more than 50 years,</i>

06:02.430 --> 06:04.530
<i>including their most famous exports:</i>

06:04.555 --> 06:05.955
<i>Sugar and cigars.</i>

06:07.428 --> 06:08.578
Toboni: We're at a tobacco farm

06:08.613 --> 06:10.447
a couple hours outside of Havana.

06:10.482 --> 06:13.984
Cigars are, obviously, a
huge part of Cuban tradition,

06:14.019 --> 06:15.953
<i>but partly because of that popularity,</i>

06:15.988 --> 06:18.490
<i>there have been a lot of
issues related to that,</i>

06:18.515 --> 06:20.615
<i>uh, with public health.</i>

06:20.640 --> 06:23.537
<i>Lung cancer is the number one
cancer killer in the world.</i>

06:23.562 --> 06:24.867
<i>In the U.S. alone,</i>

06:24.892 --> 06:27.640
<i>there are almost a quarter
of a million new cases annually.</i>

06:27.665 --> 06:31.600
<i>Half of those diagnosed
die within one year.</i>

06:31.635 --> 06:33.602
<i>But there's a new treatment here in Cuba</i>

06:33.637 --> 06:37.928
<i>that doctors say could be life-changing
for many lung cancer patients.</i>

06:37.953 --> 06:39.275
We're here to meet a family.

06:39.310 --> 06:41.343
Their dad has had lung
cancer for a while,

06:41.378 --> 06:43.511
and is on CimaVax, a
lung cancer vaccine.

06:43.546 --> 06:46.756
Orelve: <i> Hola.</i>

06:46.781 --> 06:48.483
Toboni: <i>Orelve Sanchez took part</i>

06:48.508 --> 06:50.475
<i>in early clinical trials of CimaVax.</i>

06:50.520 --> 06:53.121
<i>After being diagnosed with
stage four lung cancer,</i>

06:53.156 --> 06:56.607
<i>he was told he would not
live more than a year.</i>

06:56.632 --> 06:59.794
What was going through your
mind when you got that diagnosis?

07:14.443 --> 07:16.762
When were you diagnosed
with lung cancer?

07:20.382 --> 07:22.415
Do you think your husband
would be sitting here with us

07:22.450 --> 07:23.872
if it wasn't for the vaccine?

07:30.691 --> 07:33.892
Toboni: <i>Orelve has survived
more than ten years on CimaVax.</i>

07:33.927 --> 07:36.161
<i>It's also worked for
thousands of patients</i>

07:36.196 --> 07:38.645
<i>whose cancer fits a specific makeup.</i>

07:38.670 --> 07:40.798
<i>About 20% of the patient population</i>

07:40.834 --> 07:43.404
<i>naturally has high
concentrations of a protein</i>

07:43.429 --> 07:45.796
<i>known as "epidermal growth factor,"</i>

07:45.821 --> 07:48.622
<i>or EGF, which feeds the cancer.</i>

07:48.647 --> 07:50.441
<i>CimaVax triggers the immune system</i>

07:50.476 --> 07:53.544
<i>to target the EGF and
stunt the tumor's growth.</i>

07:53.579 --> 07:55.212
<i>While it isn't designed as a cure,</i>

07:55.248 --> 07:57.281
<i>or used as a preventative vaccine,</i>

07:57.316 --> 08:00.209
<i>it effectively manages
the cancerous cells.</i>

08:01.209 --> 08:04.422
<i>CimaVax was developed at the
Center for Molecular Immunology.</i>

08:04.457 --> 08:08.258
<i>Dr. Tania Crombet is the director
of clinical research there.</i>

08:08.293 --> 08:10.760
How many patients here have
been treated with CimaVax?

08:14.832 --> 08:15.998
And how has it worked?

08:36.852 --> 08:38.554
Toboni: <i>That means that these patients,</i>

08:38.589 --> 08:39.674
<i>against all odds,</i>

08:39.700 --> 08:43.370
<i>have survived the biggest cancer
killer by taking this vaccine.</i>

08:48.521 --> 08:50.113
<i>These results have caught the attention</i>

08:50.138 --> 08:52.380
<i>of cancer researchers worldwide.</i>

08:53.792 --> 08:55.536
<i>This is Dr. Kelvin Lee.</i>

08:55.572 --> 08:57.237
<i>He's the first doctor to attempt</i>

08:57.272 --> 08:59.198
<i>to bring this treatment to the U.S.</i>

08:59.223 --> 09:00.940
Toboni: So, what
brings you down to Cuba?

09:00.976 --> 09:02.473
So, we have been working

09:02.498 --> 09:05.011
with the Center for
Molecular Immunology in Havana

09:05.046 --> 09:08.281
to bring that cancer vaccine up into

09:08.317 --> 09:11.084
Roswell Park in western
New York and Buffalo

09:11.120 --> 09:12.419
to do clinical studies of it,

09:12.454 --> 09:15.988
and to also to do additional
research in trying to understand

09:16.023 --> 09:18.567
how it works, what's the
best way to deploy it,

09:18.592 --> 09:20.205
what are the other potentials.

09:28.327 --> 09:30.346
Toboni: <i>Dr. Lee and
the researchers at CIM</i>

09:30.371 --> 09:32.944
<i>have been collaborating
together for a few years.</i>

09:32.969 --> 09:35.006
Good to see you! How are you?

09:35.041 --> 09:37.442
Toboni: <i>Before most drugs
can be used in the U.S.,</i>

09:37.477 --> 09:40.411
<i>they must undergo clinical
trials for FDA approval,</i>

09:40.447 --> 09:43.093
<i>and for Cuban drugs, there
are even more obstacles.</i>

09:43.118 --> 09:45.050
<i>Before a trial can be approved,</i>

09:45.084 --> 09:46.651
<i>the U.S. Treasury Department</i>

09:46.686 --> 09:49.437
<i>must grant an exemption
from the trade embargo.</i>

09:50.789 --> 09:53.959
I remember when we first
came back from in 2012,

09:53.984 --> 09:55.693
I was telling our legal team...

09:55.727 --> 09:58.162
They said it was
complicated, and, you know,

09:58.197 --> 09:59.754
"This hasn't been done before,

09:59.779 --> 10:03.167
"and, you know, there are all these
federal agencies to go through."

10:03.202 --> 10:05.668
I said, "You know, if
there's a 20% chance,

10:05.703 --> 10:08.771
"just a 20% chance that
what the CIM is doing

10:08.806 --> 10:10.739
"is going... is real?

10:10.775 --> 10:13.276
"This is going to fundamentally
impact human health.

10:13.311 --> 10:15.912
"We need to be there.
We need to do this."

10:21.171 --> 10:23.070
- So they start there?
- Yes. Exact.

10:23.095 --> 10:25.157
Toboni: <i>Dr. Elia
Neninger is an oncologist</i>

10:25.182 --> 10:28.022
<i>who's been treating patients with
the vaccine for about a decade.</i>

10:29.196 --> 10:30.825
<i>Magaly Gomez was diagnosed</i>

10:30.860 --> 10:32.994
<i>with advanced lung cancer one year ago.</i>

10:33.029 --> 10:34.796
Have you ever seen a
patient receive CimaVax?

10:34.831 --> 10:36.831
No, this is the first. This is great.

10:36.866 --> 10:39.067
Toboni: <i>CimaVax is
administered once a month.</i>

10:39.102 --> 10:41.244
<i>The patient receives four injections,</i>

10:41.269 --> 10:42.936
<i>one in each arm and leg.</i>

10:42.971 --> 10:44.971
Toboni: How successful has CimaVax been?

10:45.007 --> 10:46.540
- For her? For her.
- For her.

10:51.414 --> 10:52.979
Lee: The tumors are smaller.

10:54.083 --> 10:57.869
Lee: That's quite remarkable
that you go from this...

10:58.103 --> 11:01.626
where she has, you know, a clearly...

11:01.651 --> 11:03.723
you know, a discernible tumor,

11:03.758 --> 11:05.125
and you can't see the...

11:05.150 --> 11:06.726
- the vasculature.
- Neninger: Uh-huh.

11:06.761 --> 11:09.836
Uh, and then after the vaccine,

11:09.861 --> 11:11.231
that...

11:13.359 --> 11:15.900
that's gone, you can see a vasculature.

11:15.936 --> 11:17.736
That's all cleared out! That's amazing!

11:17.761 --> 11:19.656
Toboni: So that was originally
advanced lung cancer.

11:19.681 --> 11:21.022
Yeah, Three-B. Uh...

11:21.047 --> 11:22.608
- Three-B is inoperable.
- Neninger: Three-B.

11:22.643 --> 11:25.977
But that's actually a pretty remarkable
response just on chest X-rays.

11:26.012 --> 11:28.213
It's really... it's
really quite dramatic.

11:28.249 --> 11:30.281
Toboni: <i>To hear some firsthand accounts,</i>

11:30.316 --> 11:32.772
<i>Dr. Lee visited with a
group of CimaVax patients</i>

11:32.797 --> 11:35.653
<i>who have responded
particularly well to treatment.</i>

11:35.688 --> 11:37.355
<i>They all have high EGF levels,</i>

11:37.390 --> 11:39.624
<i>and were given less than a year to live.</i>

11:39.659 --> 11:42.529
<i>Magaly has been taking
CimaVax for six months.</i>

11:42.554 --> 11:45.248
<i>Yolanda has survived
with it for four years,</i>

11:45.273 --> 11:47.840
<i>and Marta, for eight years.</i>

11:47.875 --> 11:49.809
How has the treatment been?

11:54.282 --> 11:55.281
And yourself?

12:13.398 --> 12:15.820
Toboni: <i>A year ago, a promising
treatment like CimaVax</i>

12:15.845 --> 12:18.103
<i>would never have been
sent here to the U.S.,</i>

12:18.138 --> 12:19.620
<i>but last October,</i>

12:19.645 --> 12:22.288
<i>due to the thawing
relationship between nations,</i>

12:22.323 --> 12:25.190
<i>a historic decision was made to
allow the first clinical trial</i>

12:25.226 --> 12:27.941
<i>of a Cuban drug on U.S. soil.</i>

12:28.972 --> 12:31.631
<i>We followed Dr. Crombet
from Havana to Buffalo</i>

12:31.666 --> 12:34.433
<i>as she joined Dr. Lee for
the start of the trial.</i>

12:35.182 --> 12:37.913
Lee: Hi! How are you?

12:37.938 --> 12:40.685
- My friend.
- How have you been?

12:43.849 --> 12:45.319
We're gonna start the trial today.

12:45.379 --> 12:47.654
- First patient will get vaccinated today.
- Crombet: Yes.

12:47.679 --> 12:50.709
We have our expert from
Cuba who's vaccinated

12:50.734 --> 12:52.137
- more patients than anybody, uh...
- Crombet: Oh, no.

12:55.554 --> 12:57.688
And we are starting that team today.

12:58.302 --> 12:59.956
Lee: <i>The exciting thing about CimaVax</i>

12:59.992 --> 13:02.708
<i>is whether or not you could
use it in other cancers,</i>

13:02.733 --> 13:05.362
that utilize EGF like colon cancer,

13:05.398 --> 13:08.465
head and neck cancer, maybe
breast cancer, prostate cancer.

13:12.891 --> 13:14.172
Toboni: <i> Scientists here are looking</i>

13:14.197 --> 13:16.105
<i>not only to replicate Cuba's results,</i>

13:16.140 --> 13:18.047
<i>but to test CimaVax for use</i>

13:18.072 --> 13:21.305
<i>as a traditional vaccine
in high-risk patients.</i>

13:21.330 --> 13:24.305
So, the idea there is to use CimaVax

13:24.330 --> 13:26.916
to prevent lung cancer

13:26.951 --> 13:30.285
in patients that have a high
risk of getting lung cancer.

13:30.321 --> 13:31.680
So, high-risk smokers.

13:31.705 --> 13:36.420
Uh, that's millions of people worldwide.

13:36.445 --> 13:39.528
Toboni: <i>Lung cancer and
diabetes are only the beginning.</i>

13:39.563 --> 13:42.664
<i>There's the potential for a whole
range of innovative Cuban drugs</i>

13:42.700 --> 13:46.934
<i>for breast, neck, and even brain
cancer to make their way to the U.S.</i>

13:46.969 --> 13:50.471
<i>With political differences between
the two countries pushed aside,</i>

13:50.506 --> 13:53.006
<i>doctors can share in
medical breakthroughs,</i>

13:53.042 --> 13:54.699
<i>and patients here may start to benefit</i>

13:54.724 --> 13:57.845
<i>from Cuba's low-cost and
effective treatments.</i>

13:57.880 --> 14:02.817
We're hoping that those
novel vaccines and treatments

14:02.852 --> 14:06.285
can actually come for clinical trials,

14:06.321 --> 14:09.589
and development in the United
States using the same path.

14:09.614 --> 14:12.859
So, we are on the first step

14:12.894 --> 14:15.795
on a very big journey, hopefully,

14:15.831 --> 14:17.637
that will be very exciting.

14:22.210 --> 14:24.102
In season three of "Vice,"

14:24.137 --> 14:25.604
correspondent Isobel Yeung

14:25.639 --> 14:28.440
investigated how the
world's agricultural systems

14:28.476 --> 14:31.470
are threatened by what
is known as monoculture,

14:31.495 --> 14:34.613
<i>the widespread cultivation
of a single type of crop.</i>

14:34.648 --> 14:38.215
Man: <i>The same gene is being
used almost worldwide.</i>

14:38.251 --> 14:40.691
<i>If one of those families should develop</i>

14:40.716 --> 14:42.587
<i>susceptibility to a new disease,</i>

14:42.622 --> 14:43.962
we'd be in real trouble.

14:43.987 --> 14:46.624
Now, a similar practice
may be threatening

14:46.659 --> 14:50.237
the existence of one of the
world's most popular fruits.

14:55.066 --> 14:56.458
Yeung: Ouch.

15:02.882 --> 15:04.248
Ow.

15:05.325 --> 15:07.277
We've come here to the birthplace

15:07.312 --> 15:08.612
of the Cavendish banana,

15:08.647 --> 15:10.580
<i>possibly the most important
fruit in the world,</i>

15:10.616 --> 15:13.217
<i>eaten by billions of
us every single year.</i>

15:13.242 --> 15:17.266
We're here in the very depths
of the English countryside.

15:21.392 --> 15:22.792
<i>We're here in Chatsworth
House in England,</i>

15:22.827 --> 15:26.495
<i>which is mostly known for its
stunning landscapes and gardens,</i>

15:26.531 --> 15:29.171
<i>for over five centuries
of British aristocracy,</i>

15:29.196 --> 15:32.567
<i>and, of course, for being the
birthplace of the Cavendish banana.</i>

15:34.638 --> 15:37.472
Every banana that's grown,
almost around the world today,

15:37.507 --> 15:38.928
is a Cavendish banana,

15:38.953 --> 15:40.374
<i>and because they don't produce seed,</i>

15:40.410 --> 15:42.310
<i>it's the same genetic
material in every plant,</i>

15:42.345 --> 15:44.813
and so, pretty much, every banana
that's eaten around the world

15:44.848 --> 15:48.849
started their journey here in the
1830s as the Cavendish dwarf banana.

15:48.884 --> 15:51.351
Yeung: Hey!

15:51.386 --> 15:53.487
Yeung: <i>Not having seeds
means you can munch your way</i>

15:53.522 --> 15:56.490
<i>through Cavendish bananas
without chipping your teeth,</i>

15:56.525 --> 15:58.625
<i>but it also means that they're sterile,</i>

15:58.661 --> 16:00.594
<i>and can only be grown by replanting</i>

16:00.629 --> 16:02.520
<i>identical offshoots.</i>

16:02.545 --> 16:05.398
Porter: <i>They came in through
China, we think through Mauritius,</i>

16:05.433 --> 16:06.933
<i>and they arrived in this country,</i>

16:06.968 --> 16:08.233
<i>and the sixth Duke cultivated them,</i>

16:08.269 --> 16:09.836
got them to flower and fruit,

16:09.871 --> 16:11.785
realized their potential as a food crop,

16:11.810 --> 16:13.904
and from there they turned
it into a commercial crop

16:13.929 --> 16:15.066
that they started to export,

16:15.091 --> 16:17.977
and that's when we all started to
enjoy them on the supermarket shelf.

16:18.012 --> 16:21.513
So essentially the hundreds of
billions of bananas that we consume

16:21.548 --> 16:24.415
are all direct clones
of these bananas here?

16:24.451 --> 16:26.150
- Yes.
- Yes.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.285
Cool!

16:33.494 --> 16:34.893
Yeung: <i>This quirky-looking yellow fruit</i>

16:34.928 --> 16:36.620
<i>was once unknown to the west,</i>

16:36.645 --> 16:38.840
<i>but after a massive marketing campaign,</i>

16:38.872 --> 16:40.675
<i>and an even bigger production plan,</i>

16:40.700 --> 16:44.612
<i>it's now one of America's
most consumed fresh fruits.</i>

16:44.637 --> 16:48.138
The banana business model is the
cheapest fruit in the supermarket.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.840
Yeung: <i>Author Dan Koeppel,</i>

16:49.876 --> 16:51.241
<i>or Dan, the Banana Man,</i>

16:51.276 --> 16:53.769
<i>explained how that all became possible.</i>

16:53.794 --> 16:56.419
Consider that a banana gets
shipped thousands of miles,

16:56.444 --> 16:58.014
goes bad really fast.

16:58.049 --> 17:00.550
How is it possible that
a banana can be so cheap?

17:00.585 --> 17:02.458
Well, you gotta control
the things you can control,

17:02.483 --> 17:03.887
which are labor and land,

17:03.922 --> 17:05.688
and so when the banana industry started,

17:05.723 --> 17:07.440
an essential part of
their business model

17:07.464 --> 17:10.826
was to make sure that they
didn't pay anything, basically,

17:10.861 --> 17:13.060
for workers, and they
didn't pay anything for land.

17:13.096 --> 17:14.896
How did they do that? Military force.

17:14.932 --> 17:16.964
Koeppel: <i>So, over and over again,</i>

17:17.001 --> 17:19.501
<i>the banana companies
took over countries...</i>

17:19.537 --> 17:21.202
<i>Guatemala, Honduras,</i>

17:21.238 --> 17:23.638
<i>Nicaragua, Colombia, all
over Latin America...</i>

17:23.674 --> 17:25.597
<i>in order to make sure
their business model</i>

17:25.622 --> 17:27.608
<i>of cheap bananas was preserved,</i>

17:27.644 --> 17:29.777
<i>and this led to insane,</i>

17:29.812 --> 17:32.346
<i>horrible amounts of bloodshed, genocide,</i>

17:32.381 --> 17:34.815
and the birth of the
term "Banana Republic,"

17:34.851 --> 17:36.839
which meant a country that

17:36.864 --> 17:39.554
<i>wasn't controlled by its native people,</i>

17:39.589 --> 17:42.113
<i>but by American banana companies.</i>

17:42.138 --> 17:44.243
I mean, it's kind of
shaped a lot of countries,

17:44.268 --> 17:45.825
and even whole continents.

17:45.861 --> 17:49.162
Oh, yeah, the very
makeup of Latin America

17:49.197 --> 17:52.465
<i>would not be the same
if not for bananas.</i>

17:52.500 --> 17:54.634
Yeung: <i>Now countries like Costa Rica</i>

17:54.670 --> 17:56.833
<i>are dominated not just by a single crop,</i>

17:56.858 --> 17:58.371
<i>but by a single clone,</i>

17:58.396 --> 18:01.907
<i>creating one of the world's
biggest monocultures.</i>

18:17.257 --> 18:19.987
We're in a massive banana
plantation in Costa Rica.

18:20.012 --> 18:21.707
Here in Latin America
is where the majority

18:21.732 --> 18:24.404
of our bananas in the
U.S. actually come from.

18:28.702 --> 18:31.168
If we have brown bananas, the
consumer just rejects them right out,

18:31.204 --> 18:35.675
so every single stage of this
process has to be calculated to a "T."

18:40.481 --> 18:41.783
Ugh!

18:41.808 --> 18:43.472
<i>So, on every single
one of these bunches,</i>

18:43.497 --> 18:45.682
<i>you have about 150 bananas.</i>

18:45.718 --> 18:48.819
<i>That's a lot of bananas they've
got to harvest every day,</i>

18:48.854 --> 18:52.722
<i>and an operation this big needs
an equally large work force.</i>

19:08.230 --> 19:10.402
Thousands and thousands
of Cavendish bananas

19:10.427 --> 19:12.084
have been harvested just down here,

19:12.109 --> 19:14.075
and now we're making our
way to the packing station

19:14.111 --> 19:16.730
where they're gonna be shipped
all the way across the world.

19:27.214 --> 19:29.275
The size of this plant is enormous.

19:29.300 --> 19:32.425
You've got 8,000 boxes being
filled every single day,

19:32.461 --> 19:33.761
full to the brim with bananas,

19:33.796 --> 19:36.030
that's happening 365 days of the year,

19:36.065 --> 19:38.156
so they're pretty busy.

19:38.476 --> 19:41.635
<i>The scale and speed at which
these bananas are cultivated,</i>

19:41.671 --> 19:45.104
<i>packed, and shipped is only
possible because of the use</i>

19:45.140 --> 19:47.540
<i>of this one clone of banana.</i>

19:47.575 --> 19:50.810
Yeung: How did we get to rely
so heavily on just this one crop?

20:02.956 --> 20:05.976
Yeung: <i>Agricultural expert
Dr. Luis Pocasangre explained</i>

20:06.070 --> 20:08.794
<i>that this is the problem
with monocultures.</i>

20:08.829 --> 20:11.398
<i>They're all susceptible
to the same diseases,</i>

20:11.423 --> 20:13.859
<i>which can spread like wildfire.</i>

20:21.708 --> 20:24.175
Yeung: <i>This cancer is known as TR4,</i>

20:24.210 --> 20:25.876
<i>a strain of Panama Disease,</i>

20:25.912 --> 20:29.346
<i>and it's devastating banana
crops around the world.</i>

20:29.381 --> 20:31.882
Koeppel: <i>Panama Disease is a
fungus, it's called fusarium wilt,</i>

20:31.918 --> 20:33.617
and it spreads very quickly.

20:33.652 --> 20:37.687
It can destroy an entire
country's crop in four years.

20:37.723 --> 20:40.350
It doesn't just kill the bananas.

20:40.375 --> 20:44.467
It makes it impossible to grow
bananas in that place again.

20:44.492 --> 20:47.764
Yeung: <i> Ground zero for the spread
of this disease is the Philippines,</i>

20:47.799 --> 20:50.666
<i>the second largest banana
supplier in the world.</i>

20:50.702 --> 20:53.401
<i>Bananas are central to
the Filipino economy,</i>

20:53.437 --> 20:57.660
<i>accounting for nearly 90%
of all exported fruit.</i>

21:00.211 --> 21:03.278
- So, this all used to be bananas here?
- Yes.

21:03.313 --> 21:04.747
Kema: You know here on the edge,

21:04.782 --> 21:06.915
you see quite a number of
plants that are yellowing.

21:06.951 --> 21:10.752
So, essentially these are all
infected with the Panama Disease.

21:10.787 --> 21:12.920
Yeung: <i>Gert Kema is a plant pathologist,</i>

21:12.956 --> 21:16.390
<i>who works with banana corporations
as well as small farmers</i>

21:16.425 --> 21:19.427
<i>to monitor and contain
the spread of TR4.</i>

21:20.628 --> 21:22.194
That's infected.

21:23.803 --> 21:25.928
Over there, you see?

21:25.953 --> 21:27.300
Right.

21:27.335 --> 21:30.092
I can assure you that many of
the plants that are here around

21:30.117 --> 21:31.504
that still look pretty good,

21:31.539 --> 21:33.522
most likely, they're infected too.

21:33.547 --> 21:35.142
- Really?
- Yes.

21:37.512 --> 21:39.452
Yeung: How long has this been
infected for, do you think?

21:39.477 --> 21:40.741
Kema: Few months.

21:40.766 --> 21:43.048
Once you see it, since
this takes months,

21:43.084 --> 21:45.546
you're really very, very late,

21:45.571 --> 21:48.288
and the farmer does everything
he can to kill those plants,

21:48.322 --> 21:49.655
but it's not stopping the disease.

21:49.690 --> 21:51.302
That's essentially what's going on.

21:51.327 --> 21:54.303
Yeung: <i>Farmers here are frantically
trying to stop the spread</i>

21:54.328 --> 21:55.861
<i>by chopping down the plants,</i>

21:55.897 --> 21:59.278
<i>covering them with flammable
rice hull, and burning the pile.</i>

21:59.303 --> 22:02.600
<i>This entire landscape is
dotted with rice hull fires.</i>

22:02.635 --> 22:04.679
You can see they're
spraying disinfectant

22:04.704 --> 22:06.938
and trying to quarantine the plant,

22:06.973 --> 22:09.908
but, I mean, these people have
been walking all over this area.

22:09.943 --> 22:11.575
I've been walking all over this area.

22:11.611 --> 22:14.983
There's no disinfectant around the farm,

22:15.008 --> 22:16.281
only at the very entrance,

22:16.316 --> 22:19.629
so, it's so hard to
contain this disease.

22:19.654 --> 22:21.785
Yeung: <i>With containment
nearly impossible,</i>

22:21.821 --> 22:24.145
<i>small-time farmers are left
with the difficult choice</i>

22:24.170 --> 22:26.303
<i>of how much land they're
willing to sacrifice</i>

22:26.328 --> 22:28.195
<i>in order to contain the spread.</i>

22:38.837 --> 22:40.870
In total, how many workers
have you had to lay off?

22:51.014 --> 22:54.739
Yeung: <i>This is just one plantation
of hundreds in the region.</i>

22:54.764 --> 22:57.903
<i>Thousands more acres of banana
crops have been affected,</i>

22:57.928 --> 23:00.155
<i>and the disease is spreading quickly.</i>

23:12.959 --> 23:14.536
monoculture is a bad thing.

23:14.561 --> 23:17.381
It's not just a bad thing because
it means we only get one banana,

23:17.406 --> 23:18.974
and there are many more that taste good.

23:18.999 --> 23:22.420
<i>Monoculture's a bad thing because
it's an environmental disaster.</i>

23:22.445 --> 23:24.735
<i>It's a cultural and social disaster.</i>

23:24.760 --> 23:28.261
<i>It requires the transformation</i>

23:28.286 --> 23:31.000
<i>of forests into factories.</i>

23:32.111 --> 23:34.811
<i>I'd say the chances of
the Cavendish banana crop</i>

23:34.836 --> 23:38.315
<i>being devastated by Panama Disease</i>

23:38.350 --> 23:40.083
are 100%.

23:40.119 --> 23:43.285
The question is: Will
there be a replacement?

23:43.321 --> 23:46.477
And will it be a replacement
that repeats the monoculture

23:46.502 --> 23:47.956
and repeats the mistake?

23:47.992 --> 23:52.461
Or will it be part of a sort
of arsenal of varietal bananas?

23:52.497 --> 23:55.464
Yeung: <i>The reason he's so
confident that this will happen,</i>

23:55.500 --> 23:57.766
<i>is because it's actually
happened before.</i>

23:57.801 --> 23:59.167
<i>Over 50 years ago,</i>

23:59.202 --> 24:02.103
<i>the entire banana industry
was almost wiped out</i>

24:02.139 --> 24:05.240
<i>by the original strain of this fungus.</i>

24:05.275 --> 24:08.017
The original banana that gave
birth to the banana industry

24:08.042 --> 24:09.327
was a different breed.

24:09.352 --> 24:11.612
<i>- This banana was called the Gros Michel.</i>
- Yeung: <i> Mm-hmm.</i>

24:11.648 --> 24:14.349
Koeppel: <i>It was a bigger banana
than the one we have now.</i>

24:14.384 --> 24:16.917
<i>It tasted better, in every
way, it was a better banana,</i>

24:16.952 --> 24:19.319
except it was susceptible
to this disease.

24:19.344 --> 24:20.787
<i>And by 1960,</i>

24:20.822 --> 24:24.491
<i>it was what we call commercially,
or functionally, extinct.</i>

24:24.527 --> 24:26.344
Yeung: <i>To replace it,
they needed a banana</i>

24:26.369 --> 24:27.861
<i>that looked like the Gros Michel,</i>

24:27.896 --> 24:30.946
<i>which they'd been marketing
for about half a century.</i>

24:30.971 --> 24:32.798
<i>There was only one option:</i>

24:32.834 --> 24:35.101
<i>The somewhat inferior-tasting,</i>

24:35.136 --> 24:38.371
<i>but aesthetically
similar, Cavendish banana.</i>

24:39.094 --> 24:41.352
Koeppel: <i>They invent bagging and boxing.</i>

24:41.377 --> 24:42.908
<i>They invent ripening rooms.</i>

24:42.951 --> 24:45.751
<i>They come up with all these
ways to make the Cavendish work,</i>

24:45.780 --> 24:48.881
and they gamble that people aren't
gonna care that it tastes bad,

24:48.916 --> 24:50.197
and that's what happened,

24:50.222 --> 24:52.080
and the Cavendish becomes our banana,

24:52.105 --> 24:54.401
and the Gros Michel, and
the lesson of the Gros Michel

24:54.426 --> 24:56.154
is totally forgotten.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.932
Yeung: <i>An entire global
monoculture has been built around</i>

24:58.957 --> 25:02.042
<i>exporting this one inferior banana,</i>

25:02.067 --> 25:05.635
<i>which could suffer the same
fate as the Gros Michel.</i>

25:07.166 --> 25:08.865
<i>Even though worldwide,</i>

25:08.901 --> 25:12.103
<i>there are around 1,000
different types of bananas.</i>

25:13.539 --> 25:15.912
This is a Cavendish that when it ripens,

25:15.937 --> 25:17.725
it doesn't turn yellow.

25:18.049 --> 25:19.749
Yeung: Mmm, cheers.

25:19.774 --> 25:21.812
It's better than the... the Cavendish,

25:21.847 --> 25:24.147
but this is not the
one that is exported.

25:24.182 --> 25:26.108
The market is used to...

25:26.133 --> 25:27.817
- a yellow banana.
- Yeung: Mmm!

25:27.852 --> 25:29.592
It does feel weird
eating a green banana.

25:29.617 --> 25:30.748
Mmm.

25:30.773 --> 25:32.255
- What's this?
- Fhia 17.

25:32.280 --> 25:34.660
Molina: It's the
product of hybridization.

25:34.709 --> 25:37.404
- Yeung: Mm-hmm.
- Moderately resistant to TR4.

25:37.429 --> 25:39.295
So why is this one not used?

25:39.331 --> 25:41.796
- Because the taste is no good.
- Shame.

25:41.832 --> 25:43.490
Yeung: What about this
one? This one looks funny.

25:43.515 --> 25:45.849
That doesn't affect the pulp, see?

25:45.874 --> 25:49.371
But nobody will buy them because
they judge it by the skin.

25:49.406 --> 25:50.972
Yeung: Yeah, it's not
very appealing, is it?

25:51.008 --> 25:54.280
Molina: Because with consumers,
like America, for instance,

25:54.305 --> 25:57.007
you buy with your eyes.

25:57.304 --> 25:59.313
Yeung: <i>As the industry continues to rely</i>

25:59.349 --> 26:01.468
<i>on the one most marketable banana,</i>

26:01.500 --> 26:03.495
<i>the risk of this massive monoculture</i>

26:03.520 --> 26:06.354
<i>being wiped out by
disease is ramping up.</i>

26:06.389 --> 26:09.557
<i>TR4 has now spread all across Asia,</i>

26:09.592 --> 26:12.266
<i>to the Middle East and then to Africa.</i>

26:12.291 --> 26:14.672
<i>Back in Latin America, one botanist,</i>

26:14.697 --> 26:16.062
<i>Dr. Juan Aguilar,</i>

26:16.087 --> 26:18.642
<i>is the banana's best hope at survival.</i>

26:18.667 --> 26:21.868
<i>We went to Honduras where he,
and his team of scientists,</i>

26:21.903 --> 26:24.492
<i>are inventing new breeds
in the hopes of finding</i>

26:24.517 --> 26:27.438
<i>a marketable, disease-resistant banana.</i>

26:27.463 --> 26:31.750
The pollinator is the person
who make sex with banana.

26:31.775 --> 26:33.779
- Why do you need to do that?
- For example:

26:33.814 --> 26:36.382
I am resistant to cancer,

26:36.417 --> 26:38.883
and you is not resistant to cancer.

26:38.908 --> 26:40.641
We need to make love.

26:40.666 --> 26:43.634
Make sex to get the son who maybe

26:43.665 --> 26:46.235
will be resistant to cancer.

26:49.969 --> 26:51.663
Molina: This is the sperm.

26:52.493 --> 26:53.625
Huh?

26:53.650 --> 26:55.716
This is the... the male flower.

26:55.741 --> 26:58.747
If you put your finger, you feel...

26:58.772 --> 27:01.072
that the female is sticky.

27:01.107 --> 27:04.427
This female is ready to make sex...

27:04.452 --> 27:06.910
- today. Only today.
- Okay.

27:13.650 --> 27:17.039
So, these little guys are
completely resistant to TR4.

27:17.064 --> 27:20.187
<i>What they've got to do now is
isolate this one resistant trait,</i>

27:20.212 --> 27:22.947
<i>and put it into the
Cavendish, so crossbreed it.</i>

27:22.972 --> 27:27.062
The problem is that could be a
really, really long, laborious process.

27:27.098 --> 27:29.088
Yeung: These bananas are incapable

27:29.113 --> 27:31.400
<i>of sexually reproducing on their own.</i>

27:31.425 --> 27:33.135
<i>So, Aguilar's doing it for them.</i>

27:34.572 --> 27:36.138
<i>Three months after pollination,</i>

27:36.173 --> 27:38.890
<i>these bananas are harvested,
peeled and squashed.</i>

27:38.915 --> 27:40.275
<i>By Aguilar's own estimates,</i>

27:40.310 --> 27:42.540
<i>it takes about 12,000 bananas</i>

27:42.565 --> 27:44.346
<i>to find a single seed.</i>

27:44.381 --> 27:47.515
<i>Once they find a seed, it's grown
to see what traits it carries,</i>

27:47.551 --> 27:49.385
<i>before being crossbred multiple times</i>

27:49.410 --> 27:51.554
<i>to create the hybrid they're after.</i>

27:51.588 --> 27:54.564
It's kind of worrisome if this is
one of the most viable solutions

27:54.589 --> 27:57.429
for our TR4 problem worldwide.

27:57.454 --> 27:58.726
<i>They've been going for decades,</i>

27:58.761 --> 28:01.806
<i>and they still haven't found
a TR4 resistant Cavendish,</i>

28:01.853 --> 28:03.930
and who knows how many more decades

28:03.966 --> 28:06.179
they're gonna be going for
before they do find one.

28:06.204 --> 28:08.168
Yeung: <i>While Aguilar
continues his search</i>

28:08.203 --> 28:11.272
<i>for that ultimate, golden,
disease-resistant banana,</i>

28:11.307 --> 28:13.361
<i>its future as a monoculture crop</i>

28:13.386 --> 28:16.976
<i>poses a bigger question about
our agricultural systems.</i>

28:17.011 --> 28:20.790
<i>By demanding the cheapest, most
uniform products in our lunch boxes,</i>

28:20.815 --> 28:23.961
<i>we don't just run the risk of
losing the almighty banana,</i>

28:23.986 --> 28:27.314
<i>but also the biodiversity
of life on Earth.</i>

28:46.840 --> 28:48.368
I'll save the bananas for you.
