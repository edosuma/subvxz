00:15.215 --> 00:17.683
Okay, favorite album.

00:17.784 --> 00:19.217
Never mind.

00:19.319 --> 00:20.752
What, is it that personal?

00:20.854 --> 00:23.823
No.
Never mind, Nirvana.

00:23.923 --> 00:25.618
- Oh.
- You?

00:25.725 --> 00:27.659
Joshua Tree, obviously.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.457
Sgt. Pepper.
And Rhapsody in Blue.

00:30.563 --> 00:31.757
That's two.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.299
Over the course of two lifetimes.

00:34.401 --> 00:37.370
Gershwin played it for me
while he was writing it.

00:37.504 --> 00:40.371
And no doubt you've watched
the sun come up with the Beatles.

00:41.341 --> 00:42.706
Just one of them.

00:45.178 --> 00:48.011
Is there anything better than eating
pastilla with your fingers?

00:49.249 --> 00:50.773
Doing it in Morocco.

00:50.950 --> 00:52.850
Mmm, which, by my calculations,

00:52.952 --> 00:56.183
is still 6,000 miles
from our front lawn, sadly.

00:57.190 --> 00:58.885
I'll get the tea.

01:00.260 --> 01:05.391
So, what inspired this?
This Midnight at the Oasis thing?

01:05.498 --> 01:07.295
It's a ritual I've grown to love.

01:07.467 --> 01:10.163
It reminds me
that the Bedouins had it right.

01:10.270 --> 01:12.966
They have this philosophy
called Al-Misaan.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.268
It means never forfeiting
your principles.

01:26.386 --> 01:27.751
What is it?

01:28.188 --> 01:34.559
Uh, it's a... It's a text message from
the wife of my best friend in college.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.386
Danny's missing.

01:36.863 --> 01:39.297
Can I help?

01:39.966 --> 01:42.161
The police are useless.

01:45.839 --> 01:48.069
This friend,
was he prone to trouble?

01:48.241 --> 01:50.232
Who, Danny? No.

01:50.944 --> 01:54.903
Nobody was more straight up,
more gentle.

01:59.652 --> 02:03.748
Make your bets!
Not for the squeamish!

02:03.857 --> 02:08.520
Not for the faint of heart! If you
have a pulse, you will convulse.

02:08.627 --> 02:14.498
Ladies and Dobermans,
for your blood-lusting pleasure!

02:15.702 --> 02:19.502
Tonight's first fight...
Give it up for Beta!

02:21.674 --> 02:25.371
Come on!
The great Beta, everyone!

02:27.046 --> 02:32.211
And... Stretch! Stretch!

02:37.357 --> 02:41.020
- No more bets! No more bets!
- Right, come on, come on!

02:41.394 --> 02:42.622
Fight!

03:04.484 --> 03:07.681
Yes! Lovely! Lovely! Give it to him!

03:10.757 --> 03:12.224
Yeah! Come on!

03:14.661 --> 03:17.289
Stretchy, Stretchy!

03:18.531 --> 03:19.964
Yes! Yes!

03:22.602 --> 03:23.694
Lovely!

03:26.673 --> 03:27.935
Alright!

03:41.554 --> 03:46.048
Beautiful!
Finish him! Finish him!

03:53.333 --> 03:56.097
Get him out of here!
Get him out!

04:51.157 --> 04:51.953
Kayla.

04:52.725 --> 04:55.216
Oh, thanks for coming, Will.

05:01.167 --> 05:02.964
What's this all about?

05:03.970 --> 05:06.200
Danny would never be gone this long
without calling me.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.240
He's in trouble, I know it.

05:08.341 --> 05:10.036
He didn't say anything
about taking off?

05:10.143 --> 05:11.235
No, nothing.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.204
You know he's been working
with feeding the homeless, right?

05:14.314 --> 05:16.282
Yeah, yeah, you got this whole
gleaning thing going on

05:16.382 --> 05:17.542
with local restaurants, sure.

05:17.650 --> 05:22.849
Yeah, well, I've been filling in for him,
and the thing is,

05:22.955 --> 05:25.890
some of the people
he provided meals to went missing.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.016
When Danny looked into it,

05:27.126 --> 05:28.559
he found that at least
a dozen homeless men

05:28.661 --> 05:31.562
had disappeared
over the last few months.

05:32.131 --> 05:33.826
I haven't heard word one about it.

05:33.933 --> 05:36.401
Yeah, it barely
made the newspapers.

05:36.502 --> 05:40.233
Invisible victims, that's what Danny
always calls them.

05:40.606 --> 05:45.543
Anyway, when he went to the police,
they basically shined him on,

05:45.712 --> 05:49.580
so he started
investigating on his own.

05:50.583 --> 05:53.017
This is the file of stuff
he had gathered.

05:53.119 --> 05:55.485
He always said if he ever got in
over his head,

05:55.655 --> 05:58.351
you'd be the person to get him out.

05:58.891 --> 06:01.223
And the police haven't
given you anything?

06:01.327 --> 06:04.660
That's just it. I get these looks
as if they know something,

06:04.764 --> 06:06.959
but they won't tell me anything.

06:07.734 --> 06:11.135
Hey, listen. Danny's always
been a survivor.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.737
Whatever's happened to him,

06:12.839 --> 06:14.830
you know he's going
to get himself out of it.

06:14.941 --> 06:17.102
- It's going to be okay.
- Alright.

06:19.479 --> 06:22.141
Henry helped me collate
all the data Danny collected,

06:22.315 --> 06:24.112
witness accounts, times, dates.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.548
One particular vehicle was spotted

06:25.651 --> 06:26.948
near three different locations

06:27.053 --> 06:28.145
where these guys disappeared.

06:28.254 --> 06:29.585
It was a white van.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.280
Well, that narrows it down.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.622
Just wait. A homeless dude
got a license number

06:34.727 --> 06:37.491
when he saw his friend
allegedly being abducted.

06:37.663 --> 06:38.687
We traced it to a stolen vehicle

06:38.798 --> 06:40.595
that was found abandoned
near the estuary.

06:40.767 --> 06:42.234
Is there anything out there?

06:42.535 --> 06:46.027
Nothing inhabited.
Just a former awning factory.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.766
Can you say "road trip"?

07:05.324 --> 07:08.054
Glad you could join us,
Mr. Peralta.

07:08.661 --> 07:11.323
Well, I know you were anxious
for the latest on the trials.

07:11.497 --> 07:13.931
Ms. Whitcomb, gentlemen.

07:14.033 --> 07:15.728
Please.

07:16.869 --> 07:22.933
We've field-tested 54 unique
meta-human fighters to date.

07:23.176 --> 07:28.170
19 were beaten to death in the pit,
9 others were eliminated.

07:29.649 --> 07:31.810
And the most successful?

07:31.984 --> 07:34.748
The, uh, bio-armored
meta-humans.

07:34.921 --> 07:39.255
Five of our six variations
made it through to the semis.

07:39.358 --> 07:43.624
The one we called Beta
was definitely leading the pack.

07:43.729 --> 07:45.390
Wait. "Was?"

07:45.498 --> 07:47.796
Well, we're still working
on the right dosage,

07:47.900 --> 07:51.597
but we're making more
just like him.

07:52.171 --> 07:54.469
How compliant was this Beta?

07:54.574 --> 07:58.476
Exactly what the Cabal
had been hoping for, Ma'am.

07:58.644 --> 08:03.809
Submissive with his handlers,
murder on his opponents.

08:04.450 --> 08:06.680
The perfect field soldier
for the cleansing.

08:06.786 --> 08:10.813
Right. Six months
to reach peak performance.

08:11.390 --> 08:12.379
Train them in platoons.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.858
You'll have your army
sooner than you think.

08:14.961 --> 08:17.156
Well, that presumes
you know what I think,

08:17.263 --> 08:19.857
and that, Mr. Peralta, is doubtful.

08:20.066 --> 08:22.534
Your spectacles are demeaning
to our higher purpose,

08:22.635 --> 08:25.433
but they are an effective
proving ground.

08:44.657 --> 08:48.115
What do you think
went on here? Executions?

08:48.227 --> 08:50.422
There's a great range
in age for this blood.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.431
Some of it seems months old,
and others seem very fresh.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.133
Pattern tell you anything?

09:02.842 --> 09:07.575
Medium velocity impact spatter,
multiple trajectories,

09:07.947 --> 09:11.212
all consistent
with repeated blunt trauma.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.352
Enswell.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.530
As in, "all's well that ends well"?

09:26.899 --> 09:30.926
It's a tool cut men use
to stop a fighter's eye from closing.

09:31.103 --> 09:35.870
Epinephrine, 1:1,000.
If used topically, it can stop bleeding.

09:37.143 --> 09:39.202
You think this was
a training facility?

09:39.378 --> 09:40.402
Or a fight ring.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.509
Not exactly Caesar's.

09:42.615 --> 09:44.515
But for bare-knuckle throw-downs,
it would work.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.352
My God!

09:57.096 --> 09:59.257
Who are you?

10:00.166 --> 10:02.191
I'm Helen.

10:02.468 --> 10:03.765
I'm your daughter.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.740
Don't you recognize me?

10:13.746 --> 10:19.013
Come on, I know this long-lost child
scam backward and forward.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.780
You got to work
on your delivery, babe.

10:22.188 --> 10:26.955
Your name is Gregory Magnus,
and you're my father.

10:27.059 --> 10:31.655
My name, if you don't mind,
is Charles L. Denton.

10:32.164 --> 10:35.156
If that's what you'd prefer.
What are you doing here?

10:35.267 --> 10:36.666
Uh.

10:36.769 --> 10:40.637
Yeah, give me a minute, okay?
I, uh...

10:40.873 --> 10:44.604
I'm just sleeping one off.
You know, free drinks?

10:44.710 --> 10:46.644
My buddy got me in here.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.679
To what, an illegal fight?

10:50.082 --> 10:54.178
Alright, listen, if you're cops,
I want to see a badge.

10:54.453 --> 10:56.011
That's a very nasty cut. May I-

10:56.188 --> 10:57.917
I'll take care of it.

10:58.024 --> 11:00.652
I'd like you to come back with us.

11:00.826 --> 11:04.023
I'll clean that wound, and...
And we can talk.

11:04.930 --> 11:07.160
We got nothing to talk about.

11:08.534 --> 11:10.593
This might be a case
of mistaken identity.

11:10.836 --> 11:14.670
I'm not mistaken.
I know my own father.

11:16.108 --> 11:19.168
- Piece of work, this one.
- A quality I inherited.

11:28.220 --> 11:29.482
We'll know before long

11:29.655 --> 11:32.590
whether it was Danny's blood
on the floor of that warehouse.

11:33.359 --> 11:36.055
This Charlie's real identity aside,
he may be our best hope

11:36.228 --> 11:38.355
at finding out
what happened to him.

11:38.464 --> 11:42.833
I can't begin to explain it,
but there is no mistaking who he is.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.201
Can I be perfectly blunt?

11:48.441 --> 11:50.068
By all means.

11:50.509 --> 11:54.275
Half the dreams I had growing up
were about my mother.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.611
I missed her so much that my
subconscious took every opportunity

11:57.717 --> 11:58.706
to bring her back.

11:58.884 --> 12:02.945
Charlie, or whatever he chooses
to call himself, is not a dream,

12:03.055 --> 12:05.216
and he's not a figment
of my imagination.

12:06.625 --> 12:10.254
I know how compelling
seeing this man must be.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.967
I lost him once, Will.

12:17.136 --> 12:19.434
I'm not going to lose him again.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.945
There are things
I need to know about you... Charlie.

12:30.182 --> 12:34.175
And if I wind up being wrong, you'll
be sent home with my apologies.

12:34.286 --> 12:36.948
I... I presume you have a home.

12:38.124 --> 12:41.525
I really do look like your father.
Okay, I get that.

12:42.461 --> 12:45.294
I'll need to take a blood sample.
There are objective measures.

12:45.397 --> 12:48.230
We could avoid a lot of bickering.

12:48.400 --> 12:52.234
Look, if I am your father...

12:52.972 --> 12:55.600
...do I, uh, own a piece of this?

12:59.111 --> 13:00.203
Where were you born?

13:00.913 --> 13:04.371
In the middle of a squall
in the Yukon Territory.

13:04.483 --> 13:07.680
My father was a... bush pilot.

13:09.889 --> 13:11.254
Your occupation?

13:11.924 --> 13:14.950
On a good day, I'm a scoundrel.

13:15.127 --> 13:18.426
- Special skills?
- I play blues harmonica.

13:18.597 --> 13:23.057
- Not well, but frequently.
- Your date of birth?

13:23.169 --> 13:25.399
I'll be 61 in March.

13:25.504 --> 13:29.804
Tell you what, you bring a decent
Scotch, I'll invite you to the party.

13:30.342 --> 13:32.742
You were born in Devonshire in 1829.

13:33.179 --> 13:36.910
Your wife was Patricia Heathering,
and you...

13:37.016 --> 13:40.474
You were the leading
scientific light of your day.

13:42.621 --> 13:47.183
You must understand, Gregory,
the board has been patient with you,

13:47.293 --> 13:49.284
but their generosity has limits.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.488
As does their imagination!

13:51.597 --> 13:55.590
Can you not fathom the secrets
we are on the verge of unlocking?

13:55.701 --> 14:01.606
By accepting your hysterical
and outlandish case studies as fact?

14:01.841 --> 14:05.504
I don't understand. Why are they
always so angry at you?

14:05.678 --> 14:08.511
They're not angry, sweetheart,
they're afraid.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.842
What have you done
to make them so afraid of you?

14:11.817 --> 14:13.614
T ell me.

14:14.386 --> 14:16.286
I can't.

14:22.328 --> 14:24.023
Okay.

14:24.129 --> 14:25.562
It's the drinking.

14:25.664 --> 14:31.068
I won't deny it, but I've never been
called anything close to 180.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.630
What do you know about what
went on in those warehouses?

14:33.806 --> 14:37.071
I told you. It's a little
innocent gambling,

14:37.176 --> 14:39.736
a couple of bad boys
whaling on each other.

14:39.845 --> 14:42.814
One of those bad boys,
was he a young Asian man?

14:43.582 --> 14:47.882
You know, it's... It's all kind of a blur,
to be honest.

14:48.053 --> 14:52.012
His life is in jeopardy. If you
know anything, anything at all...

14:53.559 --> 14:55.220
I get these blackouts...

14:56.128 --> 14:59.564
but, no, that doesn't include
forgetting who I am.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.394
Why are you hiding
everything you know to be true?

15:02.568 --> 15:06.368
Do I, uh, give my drink orders to you,
or do you have someone for that?

15:13.012 --> 15:14.673
Did you get anything on Danny?

15:14.847 --> 15:18.510
Not directly, but I borrowed
Charlie's cell phone.

15:18.617 --> 15:20.812
He took these photos at the fight.

15:20.920 --> 15:25.584
Now, nothing of Danny,
but look at this.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.618
Oh, my God...

15:29.895 --> 15:33.888
- Tell me that's not an abnormal.
- Not just any abnormal.

15:33.999 --> 15:36.229
What do you mean?

15:36.802 --> 15:38.599
Two years before my father
disappeared

15:38.704 --> 15:42.834
on an expedition to Mecca,
he created a number of new species.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.207
It was, in effect,
the birth of genetic engineering.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.746
He kept it all in this journal here.

15:48.847 --> 15:52.442
Now... This particular species

15:52.551 --> 15:54.212
proved to be so aggressive
and dangerous

15:54.320 --> 15:57.812
that he had no choice
but to destroy every trace of it.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.093
But if he destroyed it...

16:02.394 --> 16:05.386
How did it survive into this century?
I know.

16:05.497 --> 16:08.057
We don't even know how your father
survived into this century.

16:08.167 --> 16:10.135
Or if he even is your father.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.668
It simply begs
any semblance of credulity

16:13.772 --> 16:16.798
that a man identical to Gregory
would be a spectator at a fight

16:16.976 --> 16:19.410
in which the very species
of abnormal he created

16:19.511 --> 16:20.739
would be a combatant.

16:20.846 --> 16:25.078
Okay, yeah, it is very, very weird.

16:25.184 --> 16:26.515
What does it say
about these matches

16:26.618 --> 16:28.347
that an abnormal is being used?

16:30.055 --> 16:32.387
I worry that your friend, Danny,
may have stumbled onto something

16:32.491 --> 16:36.257
far more sinister
than extreme fighting.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.163
How good's your memory, Charlie?

16:39.264 --> 16:41.994
I remember better days than this.

16:42.101 --> 16:44.661
Gregory Magnus may not know
a single thing about what happened

16:44.770 --> 16:48.035
to Will's friend, Danny,
but Charlie Denton does.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.174
What do you know
about those fights?

16:50.275 --> 16:51.970
And don't tell me
it's all a little blurry.

16:52.077 --> 16:55.046
You know, you got issues.
Anybody ever tell you that?

16:55.147 --> 16:57.945
We know that people
gamble on these fights,

16:58.117 --> 17:01.609
and that abnormals
are pitted against one another.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.447
Do the fighters die sometimes?

17:03.622 --> 17:06.750
We all die sometime.

17:06.858 --> 17:10.056
So you don't have a problem
betting on these blood matches.

17:10.229 --> 17:13.721
Kill an abnormal, save a pit bull.

17:13.832 --> 17:16.232
Perhaps you're not
my father after all.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.568
He would never have been
so callous.

17:18.737 --> 17:20.728
Well, now we're making progress.

17:22.040 --> 17:26.375
The father I knew risked everything
for the simple belief

17:26.478 --> 17:30.175
that all creatures
deserved a fair chance.

17:32.284 --> 17:35.879
If I had a daughter,
I'd want her to be just like you.

17:37.423 --> 17:40.358
A little less borderline schizo,
but otherwise...

17:40.459 --> 17:44.725
See, that's a trait that you
and Gregory share, stubbornness.

17:44.830 --> 17:48.630
You probably drove him
to the edge, too.

17:49.935 --> 17:53.427
If you know anything
about what happened to these men,

17:54.306 --> 17:57.241
then please, tell me, Charlie.

17:57.342 --> 18:01.005
I don't know. I swear I don't.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.918
But I know someone who would.

18:13.992 --> 18:16.051
The beauty of this one
is that they built it

18:16.161 --> 18:19.062
so the engine sounds harmonized
at freeway speed.

18:20.666 --> 18:22.190
Yeah, they don't
make them like that anymore.

18:22.301 --> 18:24.394
But they are making
something new.

18:24.503 --> 18:27.233
You're the man with the 411
on the abnormals fight club.

18:27.573 --> 18:29.438
Charlie told us.

18:30.375 --> 18:31.637
I know cars.

18:31.810 --> 18:36.941
Yeah, you also know the players, and
you don't want to tick off our boss.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.640
Trust us on that.

18:41.120 --> 18:46.217
It's been going on a year,
year and a half. The money's huge.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.191
It moves through all the big books.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.954
What's the betting
on Danny Bradley?

18:51.230 --> 18:56.395
Oh, they don't go by names like that.
"Destroyer. " "Slice and dice. "

18:57.002 --> 18:58.526
"The re-arranger. "

18:58.637 --> 19:00.867
Where can we find the next fight?

19:00.973 --> 19:03.635
I could make a couple of calls.

19:03.909 --> 19:05.240
I'll tell you what I hear.

19:05.444 --> 19:10.905
But I warn you, the buy-in is steep.
And it's all super-secret.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.648
Word doesn't get out
till mid-week.

19:22.127 --> 19:23.788
Tests from the floor
of the warehouse.

19:23.896 --> 19:27.059
Everyone who bled in that ring
was an abnormal.

19:27.466 --> 19:29.400
So Danny wasn't there.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.969
Not the Danny you remember,
in all likelihood.

19:32.070 --> 19:33.833
What does that mean?

19:34.373 --> 19:35.635
His blood's been altered.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.837
They've changed him,
or he's changed himself.

19:39.244 --> 19:40.836
Danny's an abnormal now.

19:43.081 --> 19:46.175
What about the blood comparison
between you and Charlie?

19:46.685 --> 19:50.382
That's my DNA on the left
and his on the right.

19:53.325 --> 19:54.553
Father and daughter.

19:54.726 --> 19:57.286
The only way that's not the man
who made me who I am

19:57.396 --> 20:02.527
is if they used his DNA
to create a new Gregory Magnus.

20:04.336 --> 20:05.894
Yeah, it's Charlie.

20:06.638 --> 20:08.606
How are things at the Sanctuary?

20:08.707 --> 20:11.642
Magnus is coming along just fine.

20:12.277 --> 20:14.677
The asset is in place.

20:16.114 --> 20:18.742
I'm happy to hear that.

20:27.626 --> 20:29.491
Recognize this?

20:29.928 --> 20:32.396
What, From Russia with Love?

20:32.497 --> 20:35.694
It's the lab I built
based on your designs.

20:35.801 --> 20:42.104
Wow. I... designed this
over a hundred years ago?

20:42.207 --> 20:46.371
Well, not the modern equipment,
of course, but the core concept, yes.

20:48.113 --> 20:50.377
Do you remember the first time
you took me into your laboratory?

20:50.682 --> 20:55.278
Hey, look, I'm sorry, but...
I'm not getting the antacid flashback

20:55.387 --> 20:56.854
you were hoping for.

21:00.926 --> 21:05.886
You are the most talented medical
researcher I have ever known,

21:06.298 --> 21:09.267
and yet you keep your most important
work hidden from the world.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.958
From me.

21:11.903 --> 21:14.736
If you truly believe
that I have potential, father,

21:14.840 --> 21:18.139
please, help me achieve it.

21:26.785 --> 21:34.453
Once you enter this door, you are
on a path that cannot be reversed.

21:48.273 --> 21:51.436
You told me my world
would never be the same.

21:51.576 --> 21:56.604
Hey, no offense, but... your old man
sounds like a whack-job.

21:56.715 --> 21:59.513
I loved him with all my heart,
and you're remembering a little.

21:59.618 --> 22:01.711
I can see it.

22:04.122 --> 22:10.550
These were your surgical tools.
In your hands, they were magic.

22:14.366 --> 22:16.163
Is that right?

22:24.876 --> 22:25.900
Hello?

22:26.011 --> 22:27.342
It's the mechanic.

22:27.446 --> 22:28.606
Did you get the information?

22:28.714 --> 22:32.980
Not on the phone. Meet me
at Hollister and 80th in 20 minutes.

22:33.085 --> 22:36.282
500 cash per invite.
Come alone.

22:36.388 --> 22:37.821
Okay.

22:43.795 --> 22:47.561
This is the microscope
you gave me when I was 10.

22:47.733 --> 22:50.361
You said it would give me access
to an unseen world,

22:50.469 --> 22:54.269
a world you said
was filled with untold wonders.

22:57.409 --> 22:59.138
I need a refill.

22:59.678 --> 23:03.671
It's a part of you. You can't deny it.
It's connecting for you.

23:03.849 --> 23:05.783
You came back here for a reason,
Father.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.283
It can't have been by chance.

23:07.386 --> 23:10.583
Stop it, will you? Back off!
I'm not your...

23:16.628 --> 23:17.617
Father, what's wrong?

23:35.547 --> 23:38.744
You put up quite the struggle,
or so my boys tell me.

23:38.850 --> 23:41.318
The mechanic says
you're a big fan of the fights.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.184
Danny... Where's Danny?

23:44.356 --> 23:47.848
I've got someone else
I'd like to introduce to you to first.

23:50.128 --> 23:51.527
Meet your new boss.

24:23.929 --> 24:26.625
What about our rookie
from the Sanctuary?

24:26.731 --> 24:29.256
He's been given every courtesy.
For now.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.269
Ironic if he turns
into something useful.

24:32.370 --> 24:35.601
Well, I can't see him
going the distance.

24:35.707 --> 24:38.232
Just make sure
he has the procedure first.

24:38.343 --> 24:42.507
Once the Scarab controls him,
we can juice him into abnormality.

24:42.614 --> 24:47.574
With a little luck,
he might give us an insight or two.

24:47.986 --> 24:52.355
Already been taken care of.
Anything else I could do for you?

24:52.858 --> 24:54.189
Smell better.

24:55.427 --> 24:56.519
Right.

24:57.195 --> 24:59.527
There's an insect-like
creature deeply embedded

24:59.698 --> 25:01.689
in the muscles
in the base of his brain.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.290
What the hell is it?

25:03.468 --> 25:06.164
I can't say for certain
without doing more tests,

25:06.404 --> 25:07.996
but all my instincts are telling me

25:08.106 --> 25:10.336
that this is what's
controlling my father,

25:10.509 --> 25:12.704
keeping him from remembering
who he really is.

25:12.811 --> 25:14.506
Are you thinking the Cabal?

25:14.613 --> 25:17.081
These fight clubs could be
their living laboratories,

25:17.182 --> 25:19.377
homeless people,
their guinea pigs.

25:19.484 --> 25:22.146
Mom, Will is missing, and I do not
have a good feeling about this.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.049
- Have you checked the lower levels?
- Up and down.

25:24.322 --> 25:25.619
I think he might have
gone to see the mechanic.

25:25.724 --> 25:27.316
There was an address
jotted down in the office.

25:27.425 --> 25:28.414
We gotta get out there.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.461
Chances are that was just
for the snatch-and-grab.

25:30.562 --> 25:33.190
We find out where this fight was
moved, we'll find will and Danny.

25:33.298 --> 25:35.095
You know, the one man
that's holding out on us

25:35.200 --> 25:37.168
is the one man
that might know something.

25:47.646 --> 25:49.011
I thought you'd never wake up.

25:57.088 --> 25:58.112
What have they done to you?

25:58.223 --> 26:02.853
Same as it ever was...
Only now I'm better.

26:03.261 --> 26:06.560
Stronger, faster, smarter...

26:06.665 --> 26:10.066
Kayla's out of her mind, worrying.

26:10.168 --> 26:12.398
She doesn't know
if you're dead or alive.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.631
What's it look like to you?

26:16.808 --> 26:19.106
You're scaring me.

26:23.481 --> 26:27.713
There's a time and a place, Will.

26:28.587 --> 26:32.318
This is my time, my place.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.688
You don't even know what it is
they gave you, do you?

26:34.859 --> 26:37.089
They gave me a front-row seat
to the world.

26:38.296 --> 26:41.356
What was that thing, that insect?

26:43.268 --> 26:45.964
That's nothing, man.

26:46.071 --> 26:48.631
The real deal is the juice!

26:48.807 --> 26:54.074
Danny, listen to yourself.
You don't even sound like you.

26:54.179 --> 26:58.980
I've never felt so alive.
It's like I'm flying without wings.

26:59.150 --> 27:00.412
Come on!

27:00.852 --> 27:04.049
If you heard a kid in your program
talk like that, you'd kick his ass.

27:05.724 --> 27:09.592
This is freedom, brother.

27:09.828 --> 27:11.591
You've been living in a box.

27:12.864 --> 27:15.059
You'll see what I mean.

27:15.166 --> 27:18.499
You'll be a warrior like me.

27:32.350 --> 27:36.047
They've done it to me.

27:40.025 --> 27:43.222
Your friends at the fight ring
have taken our colleague.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.590
I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:44.696 --> 27:46.823
This is getting old, Charlie.

27:46.931 --> 27:49.126
It's obvious you know more
than you're telling us.

27:49.234 --> 27:51.725
Obvious to you, maybe.

27:52.070 --> 27:56.302
Even if I could lead you to those
people, I'd be paying in body parts.

27:56.408 --> 27:58.205
There's still one or two
I'm kind of fond of.

27:58.309 --> 27:59.936
You know,
I don't know you from Adam,

28:00.111 --> 28:03.171
but my mom says you're her dad,
and that makes you my...

28:03.815 --> 28:06.079
my grandpa.

28:06.384 --> 28:07.646
And that gives me
the right to tell you

28:07.752 --> 28:08.980
that you're one cranky,
ungrateful sack-

28:09.087 --> 28:11.920
- Hey, you be careful, young lady.
- My mother worshiped you!

28:12.023 --> 28:14.958
She makes it sound like you were
the smartest man in the world.

28:15.126 --> 28:17.890
- Not smart enough, apparently.
- Charlie! We're family, okay?

28:18.063 --> 28:20.861
Whether you believe it or not,
and what you're doing to my mom,

28:20.965 --> 28:22.899
and to Will, and to all those people,
is wrong!

28:23.068 --> 28:24.797
Well, we know
where she got the lip.

28:24.969 --> 28:26.732
Enough!

28:26.905 --> 28:28.395
Okay, if you have any decency
left in you,

28:28.506 --> 28:30.167
you will tell us
where that fight's going down.

28:30.341 --> 28:32.866
Look, I can't tell you
what I don't know.

28:33.511 --> 28:35.502
Well, then,
you leave me no choice.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.648
If only Gregory will tell us
what Charlie knows,

28:37.749 --> 28:40.013
then we have to find a way
to release him.

28:41.720 --> 28:45.986
I'm quite deft with a scalpel.
I learned at the side of a master.

28:48.493 --> 28:51.394
I heard him say they were
taking you straight to a ten.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.898
- A ten?
- That's the bomb, man.

28:54.999 --> 28:58.594
That's what I want.
I'm still waiting for a four.

29:00.138 --> 29:02.072
We gotta get outta here.

29:04.743 --> 29:08.440
Don't fight it. It's useless.

29:12.684 --> 29:14.709
Do you know why you're alive, Will?

29:16.287 --> 29:18.346
By the time you leave this place...

29:19.858 --> 29:22.554
...if you leave this place...

29:24.729 --> 29:25.855
you'll know.

29:35.206 --> 29:36.901
It's a local anesthetic only,

29:37.008 --> 29:39.408
so you should be awake
for the entire procedure.

29:53.658 --> 29:55.523
It's deeply embedded.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.056
What...?

30:29.227 --> 30:31.661
- What is it?
- It's the juice.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.264
I didn't think
it could happen this fast.

30:34.599 --> 30:38.433
What...? What do I look like?

30:39.470 --> 30:41.870
Like a God, Will.

30:43.808 --> 30:45.833
Like a God.

30:50.481 --> 30:52.676
There's a rhythm
to the creature's movements.

30:52.784 --> 30:54.581
If I can get it
on the proper pulse point,

30:54.686 --> 30:57.120
I should be able to pull the legs out
individually and tie them off.

30:57.222 --> 30:58.211
And if you can't?

30:58.323 --> 31:01.759
The hinged spurs on the pincers
will propel the remnant

31:01.860 --> 31:07.127
all the way to the spinal canal,
where it will paralyze and then kill.

31:08.132 --> 31:10.100
Can you hear me, Charlie?

31:10.201 --> 31:13.398
Yeah. You said
you're going to kill me.

31:13.504 --> 31:15.699
Hopefully not.

31:20.178 --> 31:22.738
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen!

31:22.847 --> 31:25.873
I give you ugly fighters!

31:27.318 --> 31:33.314
Ugly fighting!
Ugliness for the beautiful!

31:34.525 --> 31:41.363
Tonight's main card,
a Meat Club first- a battle royale!

31:42.567 --> 31:46.128
With Double Doom!

31:47.338 --> 31:49.772
Double Doom!

31:49.874 --> 31:55.938
And... The Lobster! Lobster!

31:58.116 --> 32:04.680
Versus Riot! Riot!

32:05.223 --> 32:14.621
And in his Meat Club debut,
The Boy Man!

32:19.470 --> 32:22.735
You feel it, Will?
This is what it's all about!

32:29.213 --> 32:32.910
You know the rules!
There are no rules!

32:33.084 --> 32:38.886
Last man standing walks away!
And start fighting! Right!

32:39.791 --> 32:41.088
Come on, fight!

32:41.826 --> 32:45.819
Fight! Fight! Fight!

32:46.464 --> 32:48.489
Fight! Camden!

32:49.500 --> 32:51.968
Come on, you freaks, let's fight!

33:03.114 --> 33:04.638
Yeah! That's it!

33:18.963 --> 33:19.987
His vitals are spiking.

33:22.433 --> 33:24.458
- Trouble.
- What?

33:24.635 --> 33:27.035
The front pair, doomsday wired.

33:27.138 --> 33:29.606
Completely enmeshed
in his peripheral nerve.

33:29.707 --> 33:31.299
And if it gets cut?

33:31.476 --> 33:33.467
So does his lifeline.

33:41.819 --> 33:42.808
You were born in Devonshire

33:42.920 --> 33:44.945
in 1829... In 1829... In 1829...

33:46.357 --> 33:50.293
110 over 70. Blood's moving.

33:55.299 --> 33:59.326
- Hang on, Father.
- I'm trying, Helen.

34:04.642 --> 34:07.236
Mom, he's in a lot of pain. Can't you
knock him out or something?

34:07.345 --> 34:09.040
I need him conscious.

34:11.181 --> 34:13.878
Once you enter this door,

34:13.985 --> 34:16.215
you are on a path
that cannot be reversed...

34:16.320 --> 34:20.051
Cannot be reversed...
Cannot be reversed...

34:25.763 --> 34:30.632
Well, Gregory, you've designed
the perfect fighting machine.

34:32.235 --> 34:35.728
You don't know
the hell you'll unleash.

34:36.007 --> 34:40.068
Can you hear me?
- Get it out of me!

34:40.244 --> 34:41.973
I need your help.

34:43.347 --> 34:45.542
I'm the patient, for God's sake.

34:46.250 --> 34:50.380
You were also the most able surgeon
the royal college ever produced.

34:51.621 --> 34:53.214
These last pincers
are the neural tap.

34:53.958 --> 34:57.359
How do I separate them
without killing you?

34:59.564 --> 35:02.032
The... Norwich Giant.

35:02.633 --> 35:06.091
The what? Mom, what did he say?

35:06.204 --> 35:09.935
A pituitary abnormal
on a hair-trigger to self-destruct.

35:10.041 --> 35:12.009
Isolate the creature's
neural kill switch,

35:12.110 --> 35:13.634
cut it before
it can send the signal.

35:14.946 --> 35:15.970
Sounds like a plan.

35:17.482 --> 35:20.474
Except the Norwich Giant
died on the table.

35:37.835 --> 35:38.995
Nice! Lovely!

36:22.246 --> 36:24.646
Yes! Yes!

36:26.617 --> 36:29.677
I've exposed the peripheral nerve
where it's been hijacked.

36:30.454 --> 36:32.285
I have the cut point.

36:38.129 --> 36:39.494
Do it, Mom.

36:55.112 --> 36:58.741
Game's over! Back down!
Let's get on with it!

37:00.518 --> 37:05.217
Come on! Get him out!
Fight! Fight!

37:05.389 --> 37:07.380
Come on, fight!

37:14.832 --> 37:18.825
Alright, alright, you two!
Let's go!

37:21.105 --> 37:23.972
Here we go!

37:30.081 --> 37:31.275
Look at me!

37:42.460 --> 37:43.950
Got it.

37:49.934 --> 37:52.459
D&S... Meat packing...

37:57.742 --> 37:59.869
I'll get an address.

38:22.566 --> 38:24.591
I think we have a winner!

38:30.508 --> 38:33.636
Love it! Come on!

38:43.821 --> 38:45.516
This is your time, right?

38:45.623 --> 38:49.081
Huh, is that what you said?
Is this what you want?

38:49.193 --> 38:52.321
Is this what you want?
Is this what you all want?

38:54.832 --> 38:56.527
Get up!

38:58.402 --> 39:00.495
Get up!

39:01.339 --> 39:04.900
Finish him, you dumb bastard!
Come on!

39:05.576 --> 39:07.373
Will, no!

39:11.615 --> 39:14.106
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
It's me, Henry.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.015
Will! Will...

39:18.356 --> 39:21.120
No, no, no! This isn't you.
This isn't you...

39:21.292 --> 39:22.520
Come on! Come-

39:25.863 --> 39:27.455
Will, this is not you.

39:29.133 --> 39:32.728
Henry? Henry...

39:33.504 --> 39:35.529
Help... Help me.

39:36.741 --> 39:39.904
Come on! Kill him! Let's go!

39:44.248 --> 39:46.614
Stand down!

39:48.886 --> 39:50.251
Henry, help me.

39:50.421 --> 39:53.720
You're going to be okay, Will.
You're going to be okay.

39:53.824 --> 39:54.848
Listen to me.

39:54.959 --> 39:57.484
The first thing we gotta do
is get that thing out of you, okay?

39:57.828 --> 40:00.160
Yeah. Yeah...

40:10.841 --> 40:13.309
You think
you're breaking up some fights?

40:13.411 --> 40:14.935
You have no idea
who you're messing with.

40:15.045 --> 40:16.774
You can pass the same message
onto the Cabal.

40:21.619 --> 40:23.348
Ah! Ah!

40:28.259 --> 40:29.248
What do you want?

40:29.427 --> 40:31.258
I want these fights stopped.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.294
And the genetic experiments.

40:33.397 --> 40:36.366
You surface someplace else,
and we'll be waiting.

40:37.735 --> 40:39.600
Alright.

40:40.304 --> 40:42.033
Alright!

40:49.013 --> 40:51.208
This is the last cycle.

40:51.315 --> 40:54.546
All signs are that your body
has purged the abnormality.

40:54.652 --> 40:56.813
Danny's not far behind.

40:59.056 --> 41:02.321
I keep thinking, was that me,
ready to kill a friend,

41:02.426 --> 41:06.362
or was it... somebody else?

41:06.931 --> 41:09.627
We all have
the impulse for violence.

41:09.733 --> 41:13.396
The true measure of a species,
indeed, of a person,

41:13.504 --> 41:15.802
is in our restraint.

41:25.349 --> 41:26.680
Oh, my God! Danny!

41:26.884 --> 41:28.317
Kayla.

41:31.755 --> 41:33.313
Oh, my God!

41:34.825 --> 41:36.486
I love you.

41:36.861 --> 41:38.624
Thank you.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.265
The first 10 years after you
were gone were the hardest.

41:46.370 --> 41:49.498
I kept asking myself,
"What would father do?"

41:53.244 --> 41:56.213
I can't stay here, Helen.

41:58.616 --> 42:02.211
Why not? I have decades
I haven't touched on.

42:02.319 --> 42:04.753
So much I need to show you.

42:05.289 --> 42:10.522
The longer I'm here, the greater risk
I pose to your well-being.

42:10.661 --> 42:13.494
I wanted one day to come back
to help protect you

42:13.597 --> 42:16.964
from your enemies,
not to wind up helping them.

42:17.067 --> 42:19.365
The Cabal had already
asserted themselves as a threat

42:19.470 --> 42:21.836
long before they tapped
your expertise.

42:22.940 --> 42:26.706
I admit, their engineered warrior,
the one you designed,

42:26.810 --> 42:28.471
that does make me worry.

42:28.579 --> 42:30.410
When I finally put it down,

42:31.682 --> 42:35.982
it had taken the life
of every abnormal in my laboratory.

42:37.021 --> 42:39.512
Then who better
to find its weakness than you?

42:40.858 --> 42:44.794
And what better place
than here, in the Sanctuary?

42:44.962 --> 42:46.589
I'm sorry.

42:46.764 --> 42:49.995
I'll have to seek
my own way for now.

42:51.635 --> 42:54.468
But I promise you, Helen,

42:55.205 --> 42:57.196
I'll never be far.
