STARBUCK: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:25.401 --> 00:27.402
Why don't you
do yourself a favor?

00:27.486 --> 00:31.114
Hand over your book.
My Triumphs, My Mistakes,

00:31.782 --> 00:33.366
by Gaius Baltar.

00:33.450 --> 00:36.411
The people are reading it,
and now you're sorry.

00:36.495 --> 00:38.037
Baltar will
get his trial.

00:38.122 --> 00:40.415
And this is what
you'll get, a hurricane.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.208
You'll have
sectarian violence.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.210
You will have
assassination attempts.

00:44.294 --> 00:47.714
You will have civil unrest
on a scale we've never seen.

00:47.798 --> 00:50.883
The President wants to take the
fast track on Baltar's trial.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.720
She's looking for someone to
take charge of the preliminaries,

00:53.804 --> 00:58.391
help cobble together the legal
framework. She wants me to assign you.

00:59.852 --> 01:02.687
APOLLO: These are my grandfather's law
books. DUALLA: It's from your father.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.607
Starbuck, Apollo.
I've lost you on dradis.

01:13.782 --> 01:17.076
No! No!

ADAMA: Lee.

01:18.203 --> 01:21.581
We're sending in the search and
rescue birds right now. We'll find her.

01:21.665 --> 01:24.667
No, Dad, it's no use.
Her ship is in pieces.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.586
We lost her.

01:51.487 --> 01:54.697
ROSLIN: Here's every Captain
from every ship in the fleet.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.415
"Captain Elias Meeker,
Gideon. "

02:38.492 --> 02:41.327

Watch.

03:12.568 --> 03:14.527
Heads! You see that?
Four in a row.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.572
It's a frakking miracle.
Watch this one more time.

03:17.656 --> 03:20.283
It's gonna be heads. Watch.

03:22.369 --> 03:26.747
Heads. Every time.
You see it? It's heads.

03:26.874 --> 03:30.793

You stay there, buddy.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.668
Well, you're flying.

04:18.008 --> 04:20.051
Let's just get down and
get some sleep, come on.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.595
I'm just, I'm fine.
I'm just gonna sit down.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.679
Ow.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.065
She wasn't... It wasn't... Come on.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.441
No. I gotta go.

Oh, frak!

04:38.528 --> 04:41.197
Frak. Is he okay?

04:43.408 --> 04:44.575

She's still alive, right?

04:55.379 --> 04:59.757
She's gone, Sam. She's gone. I know.

Viper approved.

05:14.106 --> 05:17.108
Never thought I'd miss
all of Starbuck's yakking.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.402
Yes, sir.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.949
Your Honor.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.327
You haven't heard?

05:28.412 --> 05:31.664
Where you been? They just
announced it. You won the lottery.

05:31.748 --> 05:35.918
You now own exactly one-fifth
of Baltar's skinny ass.

05:36.003 --> 05:40.047
You're one of five Captains picked
to serve on the judge's tribunal.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.258
Hmm.

05:47.723 --> 05:49.223
Here he comes.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.225
Frak.

05:51.309 --> 05:55.813
It's a waste of my time and energy flying
Baltar's lawyer back and forth from Zephyr.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.482
Yeah, tell me about it. Wanna
know what the worst part is?

05:58.567 --> 06:01.652
He sits back there and tries to
whisper into my ear when he talks.

06:01.737 --> 06:04.321
I've got a helmet.
(WHISPERS) Sorry.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.283
Mr. Hughes.

06:12.330 --> 06:16.417
He takes his shoes off in my Raptor
again, I might have to kill him.

06:18.628 --> 06:23.049
Client. Everybody knows he's guilty.
He gave the Cylons our location.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.967
Why even give the
son of a bitch a trial?

06:25.052 --> 06:26.802
Because he's entitled.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.387
Even him.
It's called justice.

06:28.472 --> 06:29.722
Yeah, right.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.433
To see Baltar dead

06:32.517 --> 06:34.852
and Starbuck alive.
That would be justice.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.271
There's no justice.

How do you intend to replace
Gaius Baltar's defense attorney?

07:57.227 --> 07:58.978
Will that be done
by lottery as well?

07:59.062 --> 08:00.938
We're confident
we'll replace him shortly.

Taken in the context of this explosion,
which obviously was no accident,

08:09.573 --> 08:12.074
do you really think that it's
in the best interest of the fleet

08:12.159 --> 08:13.159
to proceed
with this trial?

08:22.169 --> 08:23.878
As long as I am President,

08:23.962 --> 08:27.006
this administration
will not allow terrorism

08:27.090 --> 08:29.592
to alter the framework
of our legal system.

Right. Right, 9. Um, yeah, we

know that you're not afraid.

You're not afraid to represent
the most hated man alive.

The question is why?

10:25.542 --> 10:27.793
For the fame, the glory.

10:31.172 --> 10:36.135
You worked in the Public
Litigation Office on Caprica.

10:37.762 --> 10:42.850
You think you have the qualifications
to handle a case of this magnitude?

10:42.934 --> 10:44.643
I was born for this.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.731
That, and the fact
that I have a pulse.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.863
Lance belonged to my wife.

scratch or bite like she did.

despise him as much as you do,

15:12.287 --> 15:13.537
manage to

15:14.330 --> 15:16.164
smuggle out my papers.

have any papers?

I'm gonna get a fair trial?

Yes.

helping yourself now, have you?

to my writing.

On the contrary,
keep it coming.

shows a great change in you.

manual of yours,

16:09.302 --> 16:11.553
well, it keeps
them all guessing.

Right. Okay, okay.

Caprica Six.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.070
I'm worried about her.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.696
She's the key.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.406
They can use her

16:32.075 --> 16:34.534
to completely destroy me.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.288
I need to get to her.

16:38.373 --> 16:41.083
I need to know
what she's thinking.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.543
And I need to...

16:44.003 --> 16:45.962
I need... Talk to her.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.673
Tell her...

16:51.761 --> 16:53.804
Tell her,
I love her very much.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.847
That I'm thinking
about her a lot.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.766
I can sense that, yes.

16:58.476 --> 17:01.186
We need to find out where we're
all, where we're all standing.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.897
"To listen requires a voice,

17:03.981 --> 17:07.234
"for what needs to be known
requires us to ask. "

17:09.737 --> 17:13.490
My Triumphs, My Mistakes,
by Gaius Baltar.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.367
But you say it very well.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.119
I've done my reading.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.788
Once those papers arrive,

17:20.623 --> 17:22.541
I suggest you do yours.

17:27.630 --> 17:30.006
Fly me to Colonial One.

17:30.091 --> 17:31.174
Me?

17:31.259 --> 17:32.926
Yeah, you're a pilot,
aren't you?

17:33.302 --> 17:35.262
You don't understand. You
can't just jump in a Raptor.

17:35.346 --> 17:36.763
These things have
to be coordinated.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.765
Where would you
rather be, Major, here?

17:38.850 --> 17:40.809
As the parade float
for the bereaved?

17:40.893 --> 17:41.893
What are you
talking about?

17:41.978 --> 17:45.480
Everybody looking at you like
you're bleeding out of your side.

17:46.983 --> 17:50.110
You want to see some
real blood? Keep going.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.279
Oh, there is someone home.

17:53.698 --> 17:54.698
Look.

17:54.782 --> 17:58.160
I need those files. You come with
me, they might just give them to me.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.369
I wait,

17:59.454 --> 18:03.623
they're gonna discover that
Baltar's pregnant before I get them.

18:03.708 --> 18:07.043
What is your job, anyway?
To keep me alive?

18:07.336 --> 18:09.546
Or to keep me
from doing mine?

18:18.556 --> 18:21.850
Sorry, sir. You know your
status. You're to remain shipside.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.310
Those are
the Admiral's orders.

18:23.394 --> 18:24.936
Father factor.

18:25.354 --> 18:29.149
Come on, Kelly, give me a
break. I'm along for the ride.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.945
Don't do this to me. All right?
I'm in enough dung already.

18:43.498 --> 18:44.706
All right.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.801
(BEEPING)

19:01.015 --> 19:03.558
All right, let's give
the bird a tow.

19:09.899 --> 19:10.941
TYROL: Whoa, whoa!

19:11.025 --> 19:13.985
Hold up! Open the door,
open the door.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.947
What the frak was that thing?
Did you see that?

19:17.073 --> 19:18.615
What? What? I think it was a cat.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.575
LAMPKIN: That's my cat.
There's a frakking cat in there.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.035
Come on out
of there, Major.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.787
Who the hell
let a cat in here?

19:23.871 --> 19:26.540
He's on the other side,
push him over here.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.251
There it is. It's over there,
it's over there.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.669
There it is, there it is,
there it is.

19:30.753 --> 19:34.214
TYROL: Kitty, kitty. No, no, no,
come on. Come here, kitty. Come here.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.757
(BEEPING)
Come here, come here.

19:39.470 --> 19:42.305
Bomb! Bomb! Everybody out!

19:43.516 --> 19:46.268
(ALL SHOUTING)

19:46.853 --> 19:49.187
What the hell
were you doing out there?

19:49.272 --> 19:51.940
I gave you an order
to do a job.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.525
Excuse me.
I was doing my job.

19:53.609 --> 19:56.278
Yeah, being led around
by the nose?

19:56.946 --> 20:00.031
This bastard yanks your chain
and you jump?

20:00.116 --> 20:01.867
He wanted files
from Colonial One.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.702
It was the middle
of the night.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.162
Well, you assigned me
to security.

20:06.247 --> 20:09.374
Yeah, and there was
a bomb on that ship.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.126
And you missed it.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.170
"Security. "

20:16.424 --> 20:18.550
I gave you explicit orders.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.473
Athena was piloting.

20:29.645 --> 20:33.189
You could have died,
plain and simple.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.069
You're a soldier.

20:39.822 --> 20:43.199
Live like one.
Start acting like one.

20:43.618 --> 20:46.620
She's been gone two weeks. I didn't
realize the clock was running.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.079
Stop.
No, I'm sorry,

20:48.164 --> 20:49.581
'cause maybe
we're just built differently.

20:49.665 --> 20:50.999
You stop.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.209
Don't you dare
quantify my loss.

20:53.294 --> 20:54.711
You have no idea.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.755
You have no frakking idea.

20:56.839 --> 20:58.089
What,
you think yours is deeper?

20:58.174 --> 21:00.091
Well...
Yours is greater?

21:04.180 --> 21:06.097
In two weeks,

21:06.182 --> 21:07.891
there's going to be a trial,

21:07.975 --> 21:11.519
and I'm gonna do what I was
chosen to do, and so are you.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.940
You build a frakking nest
around this man,

21:15.024 --> 21:17.150
and you protect his ass.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.500
Frakker meant business
this time.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.335
If that thing had gone off,
we'd be picking up

21:35.419 --> 21:37.128
Raptor and people parts
with tweezers.

21:37.213 --> 21:39.631
Every day,
I wave jocks out there.

21:39.715 --> 21:43.343
A lot of them are my friends,
people I care for and love.

21:43.427 --> 21:46.221
It's hard enough
watching them die in battle,

21:46.305 --> 21:49.808
but rickshawing Baltar's frakking
attorney around? Frak that.

21:49.892 --> 21:52.310
I believe that the Cylons
want us to destroy ourselves,

21:52.395 --> 21:54.354
and this is how
they're doing it.

21:54.689 --> 21:56.481
By planting bombs,

21:56.565 --> 21:58.900
making us suspicious
of each other.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.653
You know what's funny, is by the
time the Cylons catch up with us,

22:01.737 --> 22:03.989
they won't even
have to attack.

22:04.073 --> 22:06.116
They'll just clean up
the mess we made.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.034
I think they're here.

22:08.703 --> 22:10.453
I think you're wrong.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.456
Okay, all I know is, I
kissed Nicky this morning

22:13.541 --> 22:14.833
and it could have
been the last time.

22:14.917 --> 22:15.875
Cally, that's enough.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.836
What? I kissed you, too.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.588
Some of us don't
get a second chance.

22:21.465 --> 22:22.924
Or a third.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.513
I'm going to the Admiral.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.515
All right, take a good
look at this room.

22:30.599 --> 22:33.226
Every time you leave,
memorize it.

22:33.310 --> 22:36.187
If anything changes,
don't touch it.

22:37.064 --> 22:40.233
A book moves,
shoes in the wrong place,

22:40.317 --> 22:43.028
something smells different,
you get the frak out.

22:43.112 --> 22:46.781
Someone knocks, don't answer
the door. Don't open the door.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.284
Look, you have to
do what I say.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.078
If they want to kill me,
they'll find a way.

22:52.163 --> 22:53.329
Now,

22:53.414 --> 22:56.207
who do I have to bribe
to see the Cylon woman?

22:57.293 --> 23:00.003
The nature of one's life
is obsession.

23:31.327 --> 23:34.996
Damn, I can't find my glasses.
It's like they've got feet.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.748
The Six.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.291
Yes, okay.

23:38.375 --> 23:41.920
Lampkin can interview Six immediately,
as long as it's conducted under

23:42.004 --> 23:45.298
the same conditions accorded to
the Chief Prosecutor. All right?

23:45.382 --> 23:48.134
Meaning in the
Interrogation Room,

23:48.219 --> 23:49.677
not where you sleep.

23:49.762 --> 23:53.932
Of course. But since you've been
selected to serve on the tribunal,

23:54.016 --> 23:57.602
I'm assuming that you won't be present at
those interviews, in the interest of fairness.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.479
Major has a point, Bill.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.106
Major's mistaken.

24:01.190 --> 24:04.275
I monitored the Chief
Prosecutor's interview.

24:04.652 --> 24:07.195
Therefore,
same conditions apply.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.947
In the interest of fairness.

24:09.031 --> 24:11.032
Mr. Lampkin is
still entitled to

24:11.117 --> 24:14.619
those documents that he
requested from Colonial One.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.955
Yes, right.
I apologize.

24:17.039 --> 24:18.998
We've had trouble
locating the files.

24:19.083 --> 24:21.793
We'll have them delivered
to you on the next run.

24:21.877 --> 24:25.672
I'm sorry, Major. We'll get them
to you right away. Thank you.

24:25.756 --> 24:27.090
Thank you.

24:59.874 --> 25:04.002
LAMPKIN: I understand that you had a
romantic relationship with my client.

25:04.086 --> 25:07.422
Gaius Baltar is a brilliant,
gifted human being.

25:09.091 --> 25:11.259
In the time
I've known him,

25:11.343 --> 25:14.137
he's made a sport out of
mendacity and deception.

25:14.221 --> 25:18.057
He was narcissistic,
self-centered, feckless and vain.

25:18.142 --> 25:20.018
I'm the one who should
have stabbed him.

25:20.102 --> 25:21.394
Things are looking up.

25:21.478 --> 25:22.687
Love.

25:22.771 --> 25:25.523
A precocious evolutionary
move, fashioning Cylons

25:25.608 --> 25:28.026
to be capable
of experiencing it.

25:29.111 --> 25:32.989
I don't know if it was engineered
as a tactical imperative,

25:34.200 --> 25:35.783
but it's not for
the faint-hearted, is it?

25:35.868 --> 25:37.118
No, it's not.

25:37.203 --> 25:40.288
Maybe you should have been
nicer to your mechanic.

25:40.789 --> 25:45.335
Well, perhaps Cylon love is
not the same as human love.

25:46.712 --> 25:49.547
Perhaps it's designed
to hurt a little less.

25:49.632 --> 25:51.216
How would you know?

25:51.300 --> 25:52.884
I loved a woman.

25:53.928 --> 25:56.387
Beautiful, beautiful woman.

25:56.847 --> 25:59.015
But so serious.

25:59.725 --> 26:03.478
This frowning face trapped
in the middle of a daisy.

26:03.979 --> 26:06.022
She had a way of walking.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.149
Processional.

26:08.234 --> 26:11.319
As if she were on her way
to her own execution.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.446
We had 10 years.

26:14.657 --> 26:17.033
Then it fell apart
under its own weight.

26:17.117 --> 26:18.743
Is that what you wanted?

26:18.827 --> 26:22.497
I thought if I could get over
her, I could get over anything.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.123
I could endure,

26:24.708 --> 26:26.709
conquer, be a man.

26:27.419 --> 26:30.338
Stand up to any and all
kind of punishment.

26:30.756 --> 26:34.509
I clung to an empty,
spinning bed for months.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.177
And that?

26:37.263 --> 26:40.974
That is when I finally
realized how much I loved her.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.935
If I needed
all that strength,

26:44.603 --> 26:46.771
what was the point?

26:47.523 --> 26:49.524
I needed to be with her.

26:53.362 --> 26:54.862
Did he...

26:56.031 --> 26:58.616
Ask about me? Gaius?

27:11.714 --> 27:14.215
He wanted to know
if you were well.

27:14.550 --> 27:17.302
He wanted you to know
that he misses you.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.053
Loves you.

27:20.014 --> 27:22.849
Because he can't
be here to tell you,

27:23.475 --> 27:25.768
he gave me this,
to give to you.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.650
He uses that, at the
risk of grave reprisal,

27:32.735 --> 27:35.320
to express his feelings,

27:35.404 --> 27:38.823
to put his world into some
kind of recognizable order.

27:40.534 --> 27:41.909
To be heard.

27:44.455 --> 27:48.291
He's kept it hidden because he
knows he will not get another.

27:51.962 --> 27:53.880
He wants you to have it

27:55.632 --> 27:58.926
because without you
it has no meaning.

28:00.220 --> 28:04.140
He wants you to have it
because he would do anything,

28:04.224 --> 28:07.143
anything, to be
with you again.

28:15.069 --> 28:17.403
Well, that's a shame,
isn't it?

28:21.950 --> 28:24.285
Since they'll never
let me keep it.

28:32.294 --> 28:36.381
You understand that your days are
owned and tallied by these people.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.716
The ones out there,
watching us.

28:38.801 --> 28:42.011
I think you realize what's
likely to become of you.

28:42.096 --> 28:46.808
I couldn't help you if they paid me 10
times what they offered me for Baltar.

28:47.893 --> 28:49.727
You won't get a trial.

28:50.104 --> 28:52.563
Not even a bad one. So...

28:54.483 --> 28:56.067
I have to ask you.

28:57.403 --> 29:00.154
Does your love hurt
as much as mine?

29:06.870 --> 29:07.995
Yes.

29:14.336 --> 29:17.255
I feel like part of our world
just fell down.

29:31.687 --> 29:33.020
Hey, guys.

29:33.355 --> 29:34.647
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

29:40.863 --> 29:42.113
(DOOR CLOSES)

29:42.406 --> 29:46.701
Why encourage the man to
write, and then take his pen?

29:47.494 --> 29:51.622
He'll curry more sympathy when we get
the word out that he's been silenced.

29:51.707 --> 29:54.917
Tyranny. Gag orders.
Very sexy.

29:56.003 --> 29:57.587
Okay, all right.

29:58.213 --> 30:01.674
So you steal his pen, then you lie
to him, then you lie to the Six.

30:01.758 --> 30:03.551
The horror of the age.

30:03.635 --> 30:07.054
The great, ugly material.
The cloak of deceit.

30:07.681 --> 30:08.973
The truth.

30:09.808 --> 30:10.808
Hmm.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.394
Kind of overrated, I guess.

30:16.106 --> 30:19.609
You know, when I was 9,
maybe 10,

30:19.693 --> 30:21.444
my grandfather,

30:25.741 --> 30:28.117
he would wave me over.

30:28.202 --> 30:30.286
And he'd do this all the time.

30:30.370 --> 30:31.871
And then he'd say,

30:33.749 --> 30:36.751
"Lee, be a good boy.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.880
"Just don't be too good. "

30:42.341 --> 30:44.258
Everybody has demons.

30:44.801 --> 30:48.012
Them, Baltar, you, me.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.431
Even the machines.

30:51.350 --> 30:54.560
The law is just a way
of exorcising them.

30:55.896 --> 30:58.814
That's what your father's
father taught me.

30:59.733 --> 31:02.068
You want to know
why I hated him?

31:03.070 --> 31:04.529
Because he was right.

31:04.613 --> 31:05.905
So, you hated him
because he was right,

31:05.989 --> 31:08.616
and I hated the law,
because it was wrong.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.368
Because of what...

31:10.452 --> 31:11.994
Of what it put him through.

31:12.079 --> 31:14.914
I mean, he defended
the worst of the worst.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.416
I remember
reading about him.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.126
The outrage.

31:19.753 --> 31:23.589
Helping murderers go free.
What I don't understand is

31:24.132 --> 31:26.717
why he put himself
through all that abuse.

31:27.636 --> 31:30.054
You think
he gave a flying frak?

31:31.348 --> 31:33.975
Joe Adama cared
about one thing,

31:34.059 --> 31:37.895
understanding why people
do what they do.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.898
Why we cheat our friends,

31:40.983 --> 31:44.443
why we reward our enemies,
why we go to war.

31:44.945 --> 31:48.281
Sacrificing our lives
for lost causes.

31:48.365 --> 31:50.575
Why we build machines
in the hope

31:50.659 --> 31:55.496
of correcting our flaws and our
shortcomings, why we forgive.

31:56.164 --> 32:00.126
Defying logic and
the laws of nature

32:00.919 --> 32:04.380
with one stupid,
little act of compassion.

32:05.257 --> 32:08.009
We're flawed. All of us.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.345
I wanted to know why.

32:11.805 --> 32:13.055
So, I did

32:13.515 --> 32:14.807
what he did.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.853
I spend my life
with the fallen.

32:19.688 --> 32:21.689
The corrupt,
the damaged.

32:24.985 --> 32:26.193
Look at you.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.195
You were so ready to get
on that Raptor with me.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.448
Be the bad boy,
the prodigal son.

32:30.532 --> 32:31.949
No. I was just doing my job
protecting you.

32:32.034 --> 32:34.535
What are you doing
in my business?

32:35.912 --> 32:39.665
Suddenly I'm handcuffed
to a serial contrarian.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.250
No, I am not...

32:41.877 --> 32:44.211
Okay, okay.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.839
My bed is made.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.092
I suggest you toil
on your own.

32:50.969 --> 32:54.347
Now, if this cross-examination
is over,

32:54.431 --> 32:56.349
I'd like to take a crap.

33:02.689 --> 33:06.317
Romo, that story you told about
the girl, the woman that you loved,

33:06.902 --> 33:09.070
getting over her,
is it true?

33:09.738 --> 33:11.405
Hey, was it true?

33:18.872 --> 33:19.955
Yes.

33:31.426 --> 33:34.178
For him.
Files from Colonial One.

33:34.262 --> 33:37.264
Finally. I thought I'd get all
these after the trial was over.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.391
Hold it.

33:38.475 --> 33:40.643
Put that on
the floor, now.

33:40.727 --> 33:42.228
For frak's sake.

33:42.312 --> 33:45.690
I was there when Kelly
X-rayed them. It's papers.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.233
There you go.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.362
Good?

33:52.406 --> 33:53.531
Yeah.

33:59.121 --> 34:00.621
(BEEPING)

34:03.792 --> 34:04.792
No!

34:25.480 --> 34:27.148
You've got five
minutes, Major.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.278
Thank you.

34:33.071 --> 34:36.198
Before the hounds
got to it. Open it.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.457
The President's glasses.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.334
She looks better
without them.

34:49.671 --> 34:51.130
Less serious.

34:52.048 --> 34:55.342
Serious catches on
in the courtroom.

35:00.015 --> 35:01.515
Your father's.

35:03.852 --> 35:04.935
When?

35:06.146 --> 35:07.480
From the deck.

35:08.023 --> 35:11.150
Right after you found the bomb
underneath the Raptor.

35:11.693 --> 35:13.444
Here, kitty, kitty.

35:16.573 --> 35:18.115
It was hanging by a thread.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.700
They tarnish so fast.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.744
Was like that
when I plucked it.

35:21.828 --> 35:25.331
Everybody else,
Tigh, the others,

35:25.415 --> 35:27.958
you, all shiny.

35:29.544 --> 35:32.546
The soldier in him
has had enough for a while.

35:34.132 --> 35:38.636
He'll be glad to sit in that
courtroom and fire his missiles there.

35:44.893 --> 35:47.228
Ms. Prosecuting Attorney.

35:47.395 --> 35:48.813
Down the hall.

35:48.897 --> 35:50.439
It's not what you think.

35:50.524 --> 35:53.692
It was appropriated with
the noblest of intentions.

35:53.777 --> 35:55.861
See the soles?

35:56.238 --> 35:58.197
See how the soles are worn?

35:59.157 --> 36:00.825
She drags her feet.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.910
You're catching on.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.080
(LAUGHING)

36:07.123 --> 36:09.917
And the rest?
What's all this?

36:12.254 --> 36:13.754
My demons.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.840
I borrow things.

36:17.717 --> 36:20.928
My parents disappeared
when I was 9 years old.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.305
They were kidnapped.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.432
Murdered for...

36:26.226 --> 36:30.104
For the money they had on
them, which wasn't enough.

36:30.605 --> 36:32.398
I went to live
with an uncle.

36:32.482 --> 36:35.860
Stole from him
until I could run away.

36:36.987 --> 36:39.238
So, what did you take from me?

36:40.282 --> 36:44.243
I was thinking the
photograph that you carry.

36:44.327 --> 36:46.120
That girl. The pilot.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.039
The one you carry on you.

36:51.167 --> 36:55.379
But you've had enough
stolen from you already.

36:56.965 --> 37:00.134
I'll try and get these
back to her somehow.

37:01.428 --> 37:03.762
The other pocket,
at the back.

37:07.309 --> 37:08.642
(EXCLAIMS)

37:10.645 --> 37:12.897
The guards
took it from her.

37:13.023 --> 37:16.317
I borrowed it
from them.

37:20.906 --> 37:24.867
I still have
a case pending.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.332
If you want to help,

37:33.001 --> 37:34.835
if you dare to help,

37:35.837 --> 37:37.630
get this to my client.

37:37.714 --> 37:38.714
A case?

37:38.798 --> 37:40.466
I have a calling,

37:40.634 --> 37:43.510
so the ringing
in my ears tells me.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.854
Okay, you better explain this.

37:54.648 --> 37:56.273
Don't even know
what it is.

37:56.358 --> 37:58.776
Well, I do.
Where did you get it?

37:58.860 --> 38:02.029
The one that scolded you
like a schoolboy,

38:02.864 --> 38:06.617
frakking with your head.
What's his name? Mr. Serious.

38:08.328 --> 38:09.495
Kelly.

38:11.456 --> 38:12.790
(STAMMERING) Kelly?

38:12.874 --> 38:13.999
Yeah.

38:26.221 --> 38:30.224
I never would have let Athena go
airborne with you in the Raptor.

38:31.101 --> 38:33.435
I would have stopped it.
You know that.

38:33.520 --> 38:34.812
Yeah, I know that.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.022
You better lock me up.

38:38.191 --> 38:40.985
And I don't want any trial.
I won't stop.

38:42.487 --> 38:44.238
I will keep trying.

38:44.781 --> 38:46.740
I'll keep at it, I will.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.076
I did my job, sir,

38:50.328 --> 38:53.122
and I have done my job
for two years now.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.418
Every day, I sent
people out to fight,

38:58.253 --> 39:00.295
I cleared them all to die.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.758
So many people.

39:06.052 --> 39:08.595
I just got tired
of living with that.

39:09.222 --> 39:11.849
You ask that man,
if he had to choose

39:13.935 --> 39:16.854
between giving his life up
for a Cylon or a human,

39:16.938 --> 39:19.023
what do you think he'd say?

39:20.233 --> 39:22.109
I had to do something.

39:23.570 --> 39:27.448
XO, reinstate Major Adama

39:27.532 --> 39:29.742
as Commander
of the Air Group.

39:30.452 --> 39:32.327
Effective immediately.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.875
It's good to have you back.

39:38.418 --> 39:39.418
Thank you.

39:39.502 --> 39:42.337
I'm sorry.
I guess I was wrong.

39:44.174 --> 39:45.758
I made it worse.
No.

39:45.842 --> 39:47.342
No, you should
be in your bird.

39:47.427 --> 39:49.803
I think I should
be with Lampkin.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.765
Well, now that we know
that it was Kelly,

39:53.475 --> 39:55.517
we can ease up
a little bit on security.

39:55.602 --> 39:58.562
In his condition, I think Lampkin
needs help preparing the trial,

39:58.646 --> 39:59.730
presenting his case.

39:59.814 --> 40:03.525
The President has a few
possibilities. She's looking.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.319
Dad, why not me?

40:06.362 --> 40:09.406
I'm close to the case,
I've read the documents.

40:09.824 --> 40:11.658
I understand
Lampkin's strategy.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.827
We have things
under control.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.830
Lampkin will have help.

40:17.332 --> 40:18.624
I wanna do this.

40:18.708 --> 40:20.167
You're a CAG.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.629
You're not a lawyer.
Far from it.

40:23.713 --> 40:25.756
What? And you're a judge?

40:25.840 --> 40:28.717
No. But like the four
other men picked,

40:28.968 --> 40:32.054
I'm capable of listening
to the evidence

40:32.138 --> 40:34.640
and making
an ethical decision.

40:34.724 --> 40:37.226
And I'm capable
of helping Lampkin.

40:37.519 --> 40:38.811
Forget it.

40:38.895 --> 40:40.521
I need you as CAG.

40:41.564 --> 40:43.857
Why did you give me
those books? Huh?

40:43.942 --> 40:46.193
I mean, you gave me
your father's law books.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.569
I made a mistake.

40:47.654 --> 40:49.154
Why? Why is it a mistake?

40:49.239 --> 40:50.948
Are you afraid
that I'll be like him?

40:51.032 --> 40:52.116
You're a pilot.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.660
And with Zak gone and
Kara gone, you need someone

40:54.744 --> 40:55.911
to carry the flag.
Is that it?

40:55.995 --> 40:57.704
You're a pilot
and you're my son.

40:57.789 --> 41:02.668
I will not look across that court
and see you sitting on the other side.

41:03.753 --> 41:06.630
See me?
Or see someone else?

41:06.714 --> 41:08.340
Report for duty.

41:09.217 --> 41:10.884
Is that an order?

41:11.886 --> 41:14.096
You're in way over your head.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.514
Report for duty.

41:15.598 --> 41:17.182
Is that an order?

41:25.066 --> 41:27.234
I'm through
giving you orders.

41:32.991 --> 41:36.910
Remove Apollo from the board.
Inform Helo he's to remain at CAG.

41:37.662 --> 41:40.581
My son has more important
things to tend to.

42:10.945 --> 42:12.738
Hey, how's the leg?

42:13.740 --> 42:15.824
You mean my lucky break?

42:17.619 --> 42:20.329
Gave me a reason
not to come up here.

42:23.208 --> 42:24.958
Sooner or later,

42:25.627 --> 42:27.628
you run out of excuses.

42:30.215 --> 42:32.049
It's hard to let her go.

42:35.845 --> 42:37.012
Lee...

42:39.140 --> 42:40.974
I'll see you around.

ally, no force more powerful,
