Wha

01:27.540 --> 01:28.710
My wand.

01:28.710 --> 01:30.580
Where's

01:32.330 --> 01:33.750
Aah!

01:34.880 --> 01:36.790
My hand is a wand?

01:36.790 --> 01:41.750
A wand hand?
I have a wand... hand.

01:41.750 --> 01:44.000
I-- I don't know if I like this.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.460
Wait! I don't like this!

01:46.460 --> 01:48.210
Glossaryck. Where's Glossaryck?

01:48.210 --> 01:51.500
I'm right here.
I'm right where you left me.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.540
Right here.

01:53.540 --> 01:54.920
Glossaryck!

01:54.920 --> 01:56.920
Oh, Glossaryck! They--

01:56.920 --> 02:00.540
They turned my hand
into a wand, and you...

02:00.540 --> 02:02.040
you into a pole.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.710
I am not a pole.

02:06.710 --> 02:07.710
Huh?

02:07.710 --> 02:08.830
I'm over here.

02:10.750 --> 02:13.080
Hey-o!

02:13.080 --> 02:14.460
Glossaryck!

02:15.710 --> 02:17.120
Where have you been?

02:17.120 --> 02:18.710
What do you mean,
where have I been?

02:18.710 --> 02:20.330
You told me to hide.
I hid!

02:21.330 --> 02:22.750
Oh, come on.

02:22.750 --> 02:25.500
What?
I never told you to hide.

02:25.500 --> 02:29.120
Wait. Now, which one of you
am I talking to right now?

02:29.120 --> 02:31.670
Which one?
It's me! Ludo!

02:31.670 --> 02:33.710
Oh, yes. It's you. Yeah.
All right, never mind.

02:35.330 --> 02:36.330
What's going on?

02:36.330 --> 02:37.750
Who trashed my house?

02:37.750 --> 02:40.290
-Uh, you did.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.790
You defeated
the Magic High Commission.

02:42.790 --> 02:44.210
I did?

02:44.210 --> 02:48.290
Well, not you.
Not you exactly, but, um...

02:48.290 --> 02:51.540
I defeated
the Magic High Commission?

02:51.540 --> 02:54.250
I can't believe it!

02:55.790 --> 02:59.250
This needs to be a chapter
in the Book of Spells!

02:59.250 --> 03:02.710
Then everyone will know
how powerful I am!

03:04.580 --> 03:05.710
Huh

03:08.960 --> 03:10.080
Huh

03:10.080 --> 03:12.670
Butterfly Castle?

03:12.670 --> 03:15.540
Oh, no, no, no, first I write
my chapter in the book,

03:15.540 --> 03:18.120
then I'll take
over Butterfly Castle.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.830
Now, where was I?

03:21.170 --> 03:22.960
There we go.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.830
That's not going to work.

03:24.830 --> 03:28.920
You see, only the owner can
write in the Book of Spells.

03:28.920 --> 03:31.290
Yep, that's me,
I'm the owner.

03:31.290 --> 03:33.330
Okay...

03:33.330 --> 03:35.380
Should I write
in my normal handwriting

03:35.380 --> 03:37.880
or try something
fun and fancy?

03:37.880 --> 03:39.540
What should
I call my chapter?

03:39.540 --> 03:41.710
"Ludo the Awesome"!
Mm-mmm.

03:41.710 --> 03:43.290
Nah, nothin'.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.920
"Ludo the Better
Than Everyone Else."

03:45.920 --> 03:49.000
Ooh, yes!
I like the sound of that!

03:49.000 --> 03:50.080
Eh?

03:52.040 --> 03:53.920
No problem. No problem.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.080
Just a little speed bump.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.290
Aah!

03:58.880 --> 04:02.620
I told you,
it's not your book anymore.

04:02.620 --> 04:04.080
Hmph! Okay.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.880
Maybe it just
needs a little space.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.330
Yes, that's it.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.750
I'll just come back
some other time.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.290
Aha!

04:17.420 --> 04:19.540
Hah! Ooh ooh ooh!

04:23.170 --> 04:24.880
Boo-yah!

04:31.380 --> 04:32.790
I gotcha now!

04:37.380 --> 04:41.670
So this is probably not one
of my favorite things
that's happened to me.

04:57.330 --> 04:59.210
Oh, I just
don't know anymore.

04:59.210 --> 05:00.670
Is it more heat
and less pudding,

05:00.670 --> 05:02.420
or less pudding and...

05:02.420 --> 05:04.000
Oh, forget it.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.500
Aah! Gotcha!

05:06.500 --> 05:08.290
Ow!

05:08.290 --> 05:10.000
-Hmm...
-Ow!

05:10.000 --> 05:12.080
-Hmm.

05:12.080 --> 05:15.170
Whoo! Aah!

05:16.420 --> 05:17.500
Oh!

05:17.500 --> 05:20.380
You will let me write in you!

05:34.380 --> 05:38.250
I hurt in places
I didn't know I had.

05:38.250 --> 05:41.170
You know, there's a spell
in the book that would fix that.

05:41.170 --> 05:43.290
Oh, wait.
Oh, oh, never mind.

05:43.290 --> 05:45.790
Oh, give me a break!

05:45.790 --> 05:47.500
A spell? Of course!

05:47.500 --> 05:49.580
Why I didn't think
of this before!

05:51.080 --> 05:53.170
I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

05:53.170 --> 05:55.290
Levitato!

06:10.920 --> 06:13.080
Where am I?

06:13.080 --> 06:17.000
Oh, thanks, Marion.
That's so nice

06:17.000 --> 06:18.750
Barbra? My favorite.

06:20.710 --> 06:23.920
Mmm. Oh, that really
hits the spot.

06:23.920 --> 06:28.290
Say, you got any
of those tiny pillows
for behind my knees?

06:30.170 --> 06:33.080
You know, girls,
it's funny,

06:33.080 --> 06:35.750
I know this
is a bit lolo-- Ha!

06:35.750 --> 06:38.580
but I can't remember
how I got here.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.670
Huh?

06:56.920 --> 07:00.710
That stupid book!

07:00.710 --> 07:04.540
Yaah!

07:08.880 --> 07:10.880
-Get my hands on you!

07:18.620 --> 07:20.210
Aah!

07:21.380 --> 07:23.000
So, what's that thing you said

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
about me not being the owner
of the book anymore

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Yes. Well, that's, um...
That's the thing.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.920
-The book thing.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.830
You don't--
You don't own it anymore.

07:33.830 --> 07:34.920
That's it.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.620
But that doesn't
make any sense!

07:36.620 --> 07:38.380
I took it!
It's right there!

07:38.380 --> 07:40.460
How can it not be mine?

07:40.460 --> 07:43.330
I don't know.
Why don't you ask the book?

07:43.330 --> 07:45.790
-Ohh!

07:47.250 --> 07:48.880
Hmm.

07:48.880 --> 07:53.290
Book! I demand
that you let me write
in you this instant,

07:53.290 --> 07:57.080
or I'll turn this car
around so fast,
it'll make your head spin!

08:00.330 --> 08:02.750
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

08:02.750 --> 08:04.170
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:04.170 --> 08:05.830
It's just that you have
something I want,

08:05.830 --> 08:07.750
and you won't give it to me.

08:07.750 --> 08:11.420
And I want it so much.

08:11.420 --> 08:14.420
You and I aren't really
that different, you know?

08:14.420 --> 08:16.000
We both like magic...

08:16.000 --> 08:18.960
and, uh, other stuff.

08:18.960 --> 08:22.750
What I'm trying to say is
I really appreciate you

08:22.750 --> 08:24.830
and all you've done for me,

08:24.830 --> 08:26.750
so if you're not letting me
write in you

08:26.750 --> 08:30.790
because of something
I did or I said, I-I...

08:30.790 --> 08:34.420
All right, I'm just going
to come right out and say it.

08:34.420 --> 08:36.210
I love you, book.

08:36.210 --> 08:38.120
I do! I love you.

08:38.120 --> 08:42.000
And I'd be honored
if you let me write in you.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.710
Why are you laughing?

08:47.710 --> 08:50.880
I'm sorry.
It's-- It's a book.

08:50.880 --> 08:54.380
You cannot talk to the--
to the book.

08:56.290 --> 08:58.290
I'm sorry.

08:58.290 --> 08:59.880
Ahh.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.880
I thought you were in
on the, uh-- Oh, never mind.

09:02.880 --> 09:05.540
Oh, yes. Funny?

09:05.540 --> 09:08.000
Yes, I suppose it is.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.120
Funny that I ever believed
you would take me seriously!

09:12.120 --> 09:13.620
Funny that ugly little Ludo

09:13.620 --> 09:16.540
wants to be
a mighty magical superstar.

09:16.540 --> 09:17.710
What a joke, right?

09:17.710 --> 09:19.920
Ha ha ha ha! Joke on me!

09:19.920 --> 09:23.580
Star was always
your favorite, wasn't she?

09:23.580 --> 09:25.790
The cute little sparkles
on the cheeks.

09:25.790 --> 09:29.380
I'm just a sad little dingus
in a chip bag,

09:29.380 --> 09:33.210
who you never believed in.

09:33.210 --> 09:35.790
Well, if you don't
want me in your book,

09:35.790 --> 09:37.790
then I don't
want me in it, either!

09:51.540 --> 09:55.250
Well, Toffee, looks
like you finally got him
to do what you wanted.

09:55.250 --> 09:56.380
I didn't want this.

09:56.380 --> 09:58.460
This was all Ludo.

09:58.460 --> 10:00.040
But now that you're gone,

10:00.040 --> 10:02.830
I can finally get him
to do what I wanted.

10:02.830 --> 10:05.170
I'd love to chat more,

10:05.170 --> 10:08.120
but it looks like
you're out of time.

10:12.460 --> 10:14.710
Hmm. You know, even though
I knew this was coming,

10:14.710 --> 10:18.750
it's, uh...
it's still kind of a surprise.

10:18.750 --> 10:21.250
Hey! Hey, look!

10:21.250 --> 10:22.330
It worked!

10:32.790 --> 10:35.290
Glossaryck? Oh, no!

10:35.290 --> 10:36.710
No, no, no, no, no!

10:36.710 --> 10:38.250
Glossaryck!
What have I done?

10:38.250 --> 10:40.040
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I--

10:40.040 --> 10:41.290
No, no, no, no!

10:41.290 --> 10:43.420
No, no, stop. Come back!

10:43.420 --> 10:45.120
I didn't mean it!

10:51.670 --> 10:53.000
Huh?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.920
What do you mean
it's for the best?

10:59.750 --> 11:03.250
Right.
The book was a distraction.

11:03.250 --> 11:04.920
We don't need it anymore.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.920
We don't need anyone anymore!

11:08.170 --> 11:09.750
Butterfly Castle...

11:09.750 --> 11:11.790
I'm coming for you.
