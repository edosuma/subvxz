I am very sad to see Beth go,

01:19.680 --> 01:23.483
that everyone got to see
how amazing she actually is,

01:23.483 --> 01:25.285
even if it was only
for a short time.

01:25.285 --> 01:27.654
She definitely wants you
to do the cleaning, girl.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.923
Oh, she wrote "Bye."

01:29.923 --> 01:31.491
Love you, Beth!

01:31.491 --> 01:33.560
Does anybody
have any last words?

it was the worst of Beth.

01:37.864 --> 01:39.599
Sorry I had to send you home,

this is where I belong, so...

01:43.203 --> 01:46.139
And now let
the games begin, ladies.

01:47.407 --> 01:49.242
The pressure is on,
Miss Gia,

01:49.242 --> 01:51.044
and you better step it up,

01:51.044 --> 01:52.779
or you're gonna end up
in the bottom again.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.649
I honestly feel so lucky
to still be here.

01:55.649 --> 01:58.118
-You deserve it.
-When you dance,

01:58.118 --> 01:59.619
that's when
people connect with you.

01:59.619 --> 02:02.155
Body language, mama.

02:02.155 --> 02:03.623
And we all
got to see that tonight.

02:03.623 --> 02:06.660
It was absolutely terrifying,
being in the bottom,

02:06.660 --> 02:09.730
and that will never
happen again.

02:09.730 --> 02:12.699

who they're competing with.

02:20.707 --> 02:22.209
So, so good.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.844
-Well deserved.
-You do. You did. Yes.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.313
So I'm safe this week
on a design challenge,

02:26.313 --> 02:28.281
which I didn't expect.

02:28.281 --> 02:30.317
Design and sewing is what I do,

02:30.317 --> 02:32.252
so I really
have to step my game up.

02:32.252 --> 02:34.988
Girl, let's get this shit off
and let's go!

02:34.988 --> 02:38.058

I wanted to hear!

06:12.272 --> 06:15.108
A queen from her neighborhood

06:15.108 --> 06:17.677
is a queen who knows how
to wear a skirt during winter,

06:17.677 --> 06:21.147
because she has to keep
her sugar shack fresh.

Ooh, her fleur de lis

06:31.725 --> 06:35.262
She's wearing the only dress
left in her closet,

have been puked on.

06:37.430 --> 06:38.898

06:38.898 --> 06:40.066
If she were home right now,

06:40.066 --> 06:43.837

She's wearing poutine
with cheese and fries.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.819
It's obvious she's the gravy,

06:59.819 --> 07:02.055
because she's full
of cholesterol.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.123

07:03.123 --> 07:04.090
Her words, not mine.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.926
If she could describe
her neighborhood in one word,

07:06.926 --> 07:09.396
it would be historical,

07:09.396 --> 07:11.298
because of
the history of the place,

07:11.298 --> 07:13.466
where there is a lot of history.

from downtown Ottawa.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.274
She's wearing Royal Guard attire

07:21.274 --> 07:25.845
because the only way to a crown
is to put in the work.

07:25.845 --> 07:30.750
Ooh, here comes Gia Metric
from Sunset Beach, Vancouver.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.419

07:33.453 --> 07:36.790
she wants the world to know
about her neighborhood,

07:36.790 --> 07:38.892
is that it might be
beautiful B.C.,

07:38.892 --> 07:42.262
but it's not as beautiful
as she.

07:42.262 --> 07:46.166

from Scarborough.

07:46.166 --> 07:49.803

Introducing Kendall Gender
from Davie Village, Vancouver.

08:01.047 --> 08:03.450
If she could sum up her
neighborhood
in three words,

08:03.450 --> 08:09.289
she'd describe it as sassy,
flashy, and gassy.

08:12.692 --> 08:17.897
Next up is Suki Doll
from downtown Montral.

08:17.897 --> 08:21.234
Her look is dedicated to the
iconic orange
construction cones

08:21.234 --> 08:24.137
that are found
in her neighborhood.

08:24.137 --> 08:29.342
This is Synthia Kiss
from West End, Vancouver.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.977
A perfect date
in her neighborhood

08:30.977 --> 08:34.114
would be fresh ocean air,
fresh sushi,

08:34.114 --> 08:37.083
and maybe some fresh dick.

08:37.083 --> 08:41.855
Next up is Pythia
from Villa Maria, Montral.

08:41.855 --> 08:45.859
She's wearing orange
because she stops traffic,
honey.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.428
Girl, there's a lot
of construction in Montral.

08:48.428 --> 08:52.832

from downtown Calgary.

08:52.832 --> 08:54.868
Oh, oh, oh!

08:54.868 --> 08:57.637
What people would be surprised
to know about her neighborhood

08:57.637 --> 09:00.640
is cowboys have bigger dicks
than horses.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.443
-Ow! I'm fine.
-[laughs]

09:03.443 --> 09:06.513
Oh, another one!

09:06.513 --> 09:07.514
Did she leave with anything on?

09:07.514 --> 09:08.915
No, it's all here.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.718
You all look amazing,

and make a difference.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.263
Yes!

09:57.263 --> 10:00.166
As drag takes over the world,

10:00.166 --> 10:03.970
audiences far and wide
are falling in love with it.

10:03.970 --> 10:07.307
But the magic of drag
was not always understood.

10:07.307 --> 10:10.310
Early performers were considered
freaks and clowns

10:10.310 --> 10:12.178
of the entertainment scene.

10:12.178 --> 10:15.181
Today, some of the world's
biggest drag superstars

10:15.181 --> 10:17.116
wear those labels
as badges of honor.

10:17.116 --> 10:21.254
And in this week's
maxi-challenge,
you will, too.

10:21.254 --> 10:26.292
You'll all star in the original
Canada's Drag Race Rusical,

10:26.292 --> 10:28.027
Under the Big Top.

10:28.027 --> 10:30.330
-Yes!
-Whoa!

10:30.330 --> 10:34.033
A Rusical. I'm so excited!

10:34.033 --> 10:39.873
And tomorrow, you'll perform it
on the main stage...

10:39.873 --> 10:41.274
live.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.575
No!

10:42.575 --> 10:43.576
Oh, no!

10:43.576 --> 10:45.812
Live? Li--li--who?

10:45.812 --> 10:47.313
Huh? Live?

10:47.313 --> 10:49.816
That's right, live.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.185
Singing live?
Are you crazy?

10:52.185 --> 10:55.688
Can you not hear my voice
right now?

10:55.688 --> 10:58.258
But don't worry.
To get you stage-ready,

10:58.258 --> 11:01.761
you're gonna be rehearsing
with Broadway baby Thom Allison

11:01.761 --> 11:06.132
and resident choreographer
Hollywood Jade.

11:06.132 --> 11:08.735
[cheering]

11:08.735 --> 11:11.037
We'll leave it to you
to divvy up the roles.

11:11.037 --> 11:13.406
Brad, shall we?

11:13.406 --> 11:16.543
Both:
Racers, start your engines,

11:16.543 --> 11:19.579
and may the best drag queen win!

11:19.579 --> 11:20.813
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

11:20.813 --> 11:22.415
-Bye!
-Bye!

11:23.550 --> 11:26.085
Welcome to the theater, darling.

11:26.085 --> 11:30.957
Under the Big Top is a Rusical
about a young ingnue clown,

11:30.957 --> 11:35.728
and she's trying to find her way
in the clowning world.

11:35.728 --> 11:38.064
A clown Rusical.

11:38.064 --> 11:39.632
Are you kidding me?

11:39.632 --> 11:41.868
I was literally born
to be part of this.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.337
So should we start
dividing up the roles?

11:44.337 --> 11:45.805
I know who I want.

11:45.805 --> 11:47.407
My drag is really, like,
underground and spooky,

11:47.407 --> 11:50.143
so I really, really, really
want Hennywise.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.945
-Oh, I can see that.
-I see that.

11:51.945 --> 11:55.148
Hennywise is a very
spooky-ooky clown

11:55.148 --> 11:58.518
that loves to freak people out,
and that is very much my drag.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.887
I feel comfortable
with singing and dancing,

12:00.887 --> 12:03.790
so I'm kind of feeling Corsette.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.459
-Oh.
-Come on, ingnue.

12:06.459 --> 12:10.430
My first and actually
my only choice is Himbo.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.532
Himbo closes the show,

12:12.532 --> 12:16.336
and who better to close a show
than me, baby?

12:16.336 --> 12:18.471
We have Ring Mistress
as the next role.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.173
So I think I could
comedically sing that.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.240
Okay.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.710
I'm not the strongest singer,

12:23.710 --> 12:25.878
but I can sell things.

12:25.878 --> 12:27.647
Kimora, what were you thinking?

12:27.647 --> 12:29.949
I'm looking for roles
that require no singing.

12:29.949 --> 12:33.386
Baby, we can hum a tune,
but that's as far as it goes.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.355
You would be good doing Bianca.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.489
You would be great.

12:36.489 --> 12:41.027
Bianca is a sassy comedy clown
that will read yo ass down.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.429
Okay, let's go for it,
let's go for it.

12:43.429 --> 12:47.166
I can sing, and I feel like
I would like to do Revealiana.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.535
Revealiana is not
a singing role, though.

12:49.535 --> 12:52.639
Yeah, but I'll make it a singing
role,
because I'm gonna sing it.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.073
You'll add your own flair to it.

12:54.073 --> 12:56.175
Who wants Bing, Bang, and Bong?

12:56.175 --> 12:58.678
I'm comfortable
on doing characters.

12:58.678 --> 13:01.280
I'll take Bong.
I like Bong.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.448
[all laugh]

13:02.448 --> 13:04.217
Who doesn't have a character?

13:04.217 --> 13:05.952
I'm a great dancer.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.186
Okay, so we have
Lace and Leather,

13:07.186 --> 13:08.421
which are dancing roles.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.555
Like, it's quite a few bars,

13:09.555 --> 13:12.925
so it's gonna be
ka ka-ka-ka ka-ka-ka.

13:12.925 --> 13:15.662
I will only do Lace and Leather
with the right person, though.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.597
I would like to do that part.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.766
I want it.
It's my only choice.

13:19.766 --> 13:22.201
I actually like
Lace and Leather also.

13:22.201 --> 13:25.838
I'm not a trained dancer,
but I can Vogue, too.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.908
Well, I'm not giving it up.

13:28.908 --> 13:31.010
I think we need a ball.
I think we need--

13:31.010 --> 13:32.578
-A ball.
-Oh! Yes.

13:32.578 --> 13:36.049
I am a dancer, so this
is going to be a breeze.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.316
Can I see?

13:37.316 --> 13:38.851
Just for me?

13:38.851 --> 13:40.820
That Leather and Lace.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.690
Everybody is living
for this ball, honey.

13:43.690 --> 13:46.826
It's chaotic, but, bitch,
this feels like home.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.495
Let me see. Oh!

13:49.495 --> 13:54.567
It's pretty obvious that Suki
is not winning this dance-off.

13:54.567 --> 13:55.468
Sorry, Suki.

13:55.468 --> 13:58.237
Take whatever is left.

13:58.237 --> 14:01.908
Bing is the leftover,
and I ain't no leftover.

14:01.908 --> 14:03.676
If it's gonna be like that,

14:03.676 --> 14:06.245
I'll take Bing,
and I'll snatch it.

14:06.245 --> 14:07.146
-Perfect.
-All right!

14:07.146 --> 14:08.281
We got our cast.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.583
I feel good about this.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.085
Yeah, I feel like really good.

14:12.085 --> 14:15.154
This week's maxi-challenge
is a Rusical,

14:15.154 --> 14:18.791
and we have to sing live
on stage.

14:18.791 --> 14:19.959
Not pre-recorded.

14:19.959 --> 14:22.595
So this is gonna be a wild ride.

14:22.595 --> 14:25.131
These are the leading roles,

14:25.131 --> 14:27.266
which have the most lines
and the most lyrics.

14:27.266 --> 14:28.601
And since it's live--

14:28.601 --> 14:30.903
If they fuck up one word,
they're fucked.

14:30.903 --> 14:33.740
Icesis and I are the mean girls,

14:33.740 --> 14:35.708
and, bitch,
we are method actors.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.610
Who are you
most concerned about,

14:37.610 --> 14:40.379
in terms of groups
or characters?

14:40.379 --> 14:41.647
Bing, Bang, Bong.

14:41.647 --> 14:44.417
Suki is not a comedy queen.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.552
Hey, Corsette,
it's nice to meet ya.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.588
-Hey there!
-Hey there!

14:48.588 --> 14:50.089
Oops, did I--

14:50.089 --> 14:51.891
Oops, did I electrocute you?

14:51.891 --> 14:54.560
[both laugh]
Good luck being a clown, bitch.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.131
Hello, my darlings.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.031
-Hi.
-Hello.

14:59.031 --> 15:00.500
Hey!

15:00.500 --> 15:03.703
It is time for vocal coaching
with Thom Allison.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.037
First thing
I wanna say is this.

15:05.037 --> 15:06.539
It's not about the singing,

15:06.539 --> 15:08.741
it's about serving it up, right?

15:08.741 --> 15:10.443
That's it. It's all about
being the character.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.880
So, Pythia, come on, baby.

15:13.880 --> 15:17.116

15:17.116 --> 15:20.953

15:20.953 --> 15:22.722
Oh, I love stunt casting.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.235
is more of, like,
a physical comedy role,

15:36.235 --> 15:38.037
so my biggest challenge
is really

15:38.037 --> 15:40.907
nailing the character's
voice and mannerisms.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.708

It's the grotesque.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.382
But, you know, the beautiful
and the glamour,

15:53.486 --> 15:54.787

15:54.787 --> 15:57.190
but I know that
I can turn the freak on.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.124
That's fantastic.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.019
-Did you get that?
-Whew.

16:27.019 --> 16:30.056
I loved me some
musical theater growing up,

16:30.056 --> 16:32.258
so this is definitely
dusting off some old skills.

16:32.258 --> 16:33.292
That's gold.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.713
-Hello!
-Hi!

19:40.713 --> 19:43.949
It's time for choreography
with Hollywood Jade.

19:43.949 --> 19:45.451
Jesus, help us.

19:45.451 --> 19:46.952
We're gonna get right into this,

19:46.952 --> 19:50.990
because you two
are our dancing divas.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.526
Mm-hmm.
So the Leather and Lace role

19:53.526 --> 19:55.628
requires a lot of dancing.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.963
Your turn is one, jump out, two.

19:57.963 --> 19:59.031
Okay. Turn.

19:59.031 --> 20:03.002
And I don't know who can dance
like me in this competition.

20:03.002 --> 20:07.239
You're gonna almost, like,
grab your head and whip to down.

20:07.239 --> 20:08.774
No, honey, it's whip, down.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.843
Come on, dancing queens.

20:10.843 --> 20:14.313
Hollywood is giving
Leather and Lace

20:14.313 --> 20:17.917
a run for their money.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.385
Bigger breath.

20:19.385 --> 20:20.786
[laughs] Okay.

20:20.786 --> 20:21.821
[exhales]

20:21.821 --> 20:24.023
You think I'm joking,
but I'm so serious.

20:24.023 --> 20:27.660
Leather and Lace, to me,
they're the "it" girls.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.561
Back it up.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.464
I know at some point
I'm gonna get it,

20:31.464 --> 20:34.800
but I'm not sure about Icesis.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.102
Cross your face.

20:36.102 --> 20:38.037
-Holy fuck. Yeah.
-Yes?

20:38.037 --> 20:42.174
Right now, I'm thinking maybe
I bit off more than I can chew.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.110
Let's see that from the top.

20:44.110 --> 20:49.448
This is not a bar performance,
and she's worried.

20:49.448 --> 20:50.749
Up two, three, whip, four.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.985
-[laughs]
-Uh-huh.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.620
You guys cast it yourselves?

20:54.620 --> 20:55.955
-Yeah.
-Yes, they did.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.390
And you saw
that it said "dancers."

20:58.390 --> 20:59.625
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.194
One more time.

21:02.194 --> 21:05.064
[all laugh]

21:05.064 --> 21:06.632
Miss Bianca.

21:06.632 --> 21:10.970
So you're giving us sort of,
like,
stand-up comedy.

21:10.970 --> 21:13.639
Although it's a speaking role,
you have to be in count,

21:13.639 --> 21:16.442
and there are musical cues

21:16.442 --> 21:19.378
to where you are supposed to
deliver
and land your lines.

21:19.378 --> 21:21.247
Well, how about being a bitch?

21:21.247 --> 21:23.315
Well, how about being a bitch?

21:23.315 --> 21:24.416
-You know what I mean?
-Yep.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.652
Well, how about being a bitch?

21:26.652 --> 21:27.786
Uh-huh.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.623
I'm Bianca. Nice to meet you.
Not really.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.691
-Werk.
-Hey, you wanna be a clown?

21:32.691 --> 21:36.262
Honey, the spirit
has taken over.

21:36.262 --> 21:37.997
I'm letting you have it,
but guess what?

21:37.997 --> 21:39.632
I'm just gonna be keep moving
all the way back here.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.600
[all laugh]

21:41.600 --> 21:44.103
And you know what?
I'm about to be done.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.872
[cheers and applause]

21:46.872 --> 21:48.874
I love the energy,
the attitude's there.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.609
This hand wave,
walking back, baby.

21:50.609 --> 21:53.012
-Yes, yes!
-[laughs]

21:53.012 --> 21:57.183
And, ladies, this is an example
of committing completely.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.751
She doesn't know
all of her words,

21:58.751 --> 21:59.652
but you know what?

21:59.652 --> 22:01.453
She came out here
and she performed it.

22:01.453 --> 22:02.855
Bring on the clowns!

22:04.523 --> 22:07.193
And right away.
Like, you don't have to wait.

22:07.193 --> 22:09.528
And then shimmy.

22:09.528 --> 22:11.897
Okay, um...

22:11.897 --> 22:14.166
That's a choice.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.969
I'm generally a good dancer
when it's my move.

22:16.969 --> 22:21.307
To learn choreography from
someone
that is in the business,

22:21.307 --> 22:23.943
it's kind of intimidating.

22:23.943 --> 22:27.680
Keep them rolling
on the floor, turn down.

22:29.315 --> 22:31.884
Bing, Bang, and Bong.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.852
Oh, there's some clowns
in this circus.

22:33.852 --> 22:37.423
The narrative is more important
than the step.

22:37.423 --> 22:41.594
If you commit to your character,
whatever you do, we will accept.

22:41.594 --> 22:44.063
I'm in a state of panic
right now.

22:44.063 --> 22:46.365
One, two, three. Wrong side.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.266
One more time.
Here we go.

22:47.266 --> 22:49.301
This is chaos.

22:49.301 --> 22:51.337
How are we gonna do this?

22:51.337 --> 22:53.872
I want to cry.

22:55.975 --> 22:59.445
[cheering]

22:59.445 --> 23:01.981
It's elimination day.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.283
Who's going home, ladies?

23:04.283 --> 23:05.751
Because it's not me.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.021
You look like you're stressed.

23:09.021 --> 23:10.322
-I am.
-You're rushing.

23:10.322 --> 23:11.423
I'm always stressed,

23:11.423 --> 23:13.959
trying to rush so we have
enough time to practice.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.728
For a self-proclaimed
dance queen,

23:15.728 --> 23:19.431
I really need
to nail this performance.

23:20.666 --> 23:23.402
We are rapping,
and I barely speak English.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.470
[laughs]

23:24.470 --> 23:25.738
I am from Colombia,

23:25.738 --> 23:28.741
but I moved to Qubec City
13 years ago.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.477
You get a lot of shit
going to a new country, I think.

23:31.477 --> 23:32.544
Of course.

23:32.544 --> 23:35.381
The first months are so hard.

23:35.381 --> 23:39.885
You have to get used to
a completely different culture,

23:39.885 --> 23:41.820
another language,

23:41.820 --> 23:44.290
trying to make friends.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.625
Moving here to Canada,
you would think your life

23:46.625 --> 23:48.727
gets better right away.

23:48.727 --> 23:50.296
But it actually didn't.

23:50.296 --> 23:52.064
No, it's really the reality.

23:52.064 --> 23:53.432
Like, we grew up in,
like, subsidized housing,

23:53.432 --> 23:55.234
like, with other immigrant kids

23:55.234 --> 23:56.468
who were, like,
first generation.

23:56.468 --> 23:58.570
And then facing all the racism.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.639
Oh, and homophobia.

24:00.639 --> 24:01.840
Oh, my God.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.376
People think that this
is not a reality in Canada.

24:04.376 --> 24:08.147
It doesn't help that I'm gay,
a closeted gay.

24:08.147 --> 24:10.082
I was a fat kid,
and I'm Asian.

24:10.082 --> 24:10.983
-Oh, were you?
-Yeah.

24:10.983 --> 24:13.218
I used to be over 300 pounds,

24:13.218 --> 24:14.753
because I was a depressed kid.

24:14.753 --> 24:18.991
I was not happy at all,
you know, growing up,

24:18.991 --> 24:20.893
and I feel that's really hard.

24:20.893 --> 24:21.860
When I was a kid,

24:21.860 --> 24:24.763
I was bullied and teased
by my friends and my family.

24:24.763 --> 24:26.932
And, like, I feel like
nobody is on my team.

24:26.932 --> 24:28.434
That's rough.

24:28.434 --> 24:31.804
Hearing Stephanie's story,
it just shook me,

24:31.804 --> 24:36.175
because as drag queens we always
present this strong character.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.343
And sometimes, you don't know

24:37.343 --> 24:40.846
what the person next to you
has experienced.

24:40.846 --> 24:44.016
I was lucky, because,
like, I was adopted,

24:44.016 --> 24:46.952
so I never,
like, really struggled

24:46.952 --> 24:49.221
with the culture shock.

24:49.221 --> 24:52.858
My parents, like, abandoned me
in the forest back in Haiti.

24:52.858 --> 24:54.026
-What?
-Oh, no!

24:54.026 --> 24:55.861
Yeah, yeah, they found me
in a forest.

24:55.861 --> 24:57.696
I was 11 month.

24:57.696 --> 24:59.131
-What?
-Yeah.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.033
I had been put
into an orphanage,

25:01.033 --> 25:04.169
and then my parents adopted me.

25:04.169 --> 25:07.406
For me, being abandoned
as a baby,

25:07.406 --> 25:08.907
it's not a sad story.

25:08.907 --> 25:12.010
Because if that didn't happen,

25:12.010 --> 25:14.947
I don't think that
I could have been doing drag

25:14.947 --> 25:17.349
if I had stayed in Haiti,

25:17.349 --> 25:22.287
and I wouldn't have been adopted
by this incredible family.

25:22.287 --> 25:23.522
But thank God they did.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.490
So I'm so lucky!

25:24.490 --> 25:25.858
Thank God they did.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.493
And you were fed well.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.762
[all laugh]

25:32.297 --> 25:33.999
[laughs]

25:50.549 --> 25:53.452
Yeah, that's what we wanna see!

25:56.955 --> 25:58.290
I'm living.

25:58.290 --> 26:01.226
Welcome to the main stage
of Canada's Drag Race.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.929
He's been a Brad, Brad boy.

26:03.929 --> 26:06.999
It's the dashing Brad Goreski!

26:06.999 --> 26:09.168
Hey, Brad, am I sickening?

26:09.168 --> 26:11.003
Honey, I think
you've got leopard-sy.

26:11.003 --> 26:12.538
And lookie here.

26:12.538 --> 26:15.107
It's my queen supreme,
Traci Melchor.

26:15.107 --> 26:16.141
Thank you.

26:16.141 --> 26:19.278
Having me here
is such a kind jester.

26:19.278 --> 26:20.979
[all laugh]

26:20.979 --> 26:21.947
And our good friend,

26:21.947 --> 26:24.850
choreographer extraordinaire
Hollywood Jade.

26:24.850 --> 26:26.852
You know how I can tell
you're a dancer?

26:26.852 --> 26:27.953
How, Brooke?

26:27.953 --> 26:29.288
Got a little boogie.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.255
[all laugh]

26:30.255 --> 26:31.890
This week
we challenged our queens

26:31.890 --> 26:33.091
to clown the house down

26:33.091 --> 26:36.328
in the original Rusical
Under the Big Top.

26:36.328 --> 26:39.498
Racers, start your engines,

26:39.498 --> 26:44.269
and may the best drag queen win.

26:44.269 --> 26:47.039
And now it's time

39:52.924 --> 39:55.093
Suki: I'm walking
down the runway

39:55.093 --> 39:57.195
giving you tent,
giving you money,

39:57.195 --> 39:59.230
giving you the full storyline.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.131
Hollywood: She said,

40:00.131 --> 40:01.466
"I'm gonna pull you
out of my hat.

40:01.466 --> 40:03.368
What's behind that tent?

40:03.368 --> 40:05.203
Oh, 10 inches!

40:05.203 --> 40:06.337
Traci: Something tells me

40:06.337 --> 40:09.207
this isn't her first time
under a big top.

40:09.207 --> 40:10.341
Brooke Lynn: Adriana.

40:10.341 --> 40:14.312
Adriana: I'm giving the judges
bizarro freak aerial artist.

40:14.312 --> 40:16.281
She's walking a fine line.

40:16.281 --> 40:18.716
Brad: This is
a well-balanced look.

40:18.716 --> 40:20.852
I am walking this tightrope,

40:20.852 --> 40:22.320
and I am showing you

40:22.320 --> 40:27.125
more than 8.000 stones
on my body-ody-ody.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.160
I've never been so shiny.

40:29.160 --> 40:32.063
Brooke Lynn: I hear
she's got a tight...rope.

40:32.063 --> 40:34.198
And finally, Stephanie Prince.

40:34.198 --> 40:36.501
Stephanie:
I am serving you

40:36.501 --> 40:38.569
circus burlesque showgirl,

40:38.569 --> 40:41.739
and then, boom,
she's a bearded lady.

40:41.739 --> 40:46.611
And her beard goes all the way
down to her vagina, bitch.

40:46.611 --> 40:48.513
Traci:
She's my hairy godmother.

40:48.513 --> 40:50.548
I am giving you
circus freak chic.

40:50.548 --> 40:53.618
Look at my tassels.
So shiny. Mm!

40:53.618 --> 40:54.852
[laughs]

40:54.852 --> 40:58.389
Bitch, she might be hairy,
but my tits are fucking smooth.

40:58.389 --> 41:00.191
We shaved the best for last.

41:01.926 --> 41:04.262
Welcome, queens.

41:04.262 --> 41:07.231
When I call your name,
please step forward.

41:08.433 --> 41:09.400
Icesis Couture.

41:10.735 --> 41:12.737
Kendall Gender.

41:13.738 --> 41:16.140
Suki Doll.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.876
Ocane Aqua-Black.

41:18.876 --> 41:20.945
Gia Metric.

41:20.945 --> 41:22.814
Pythia.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.015
Eve 6000.

41:25.917 --> 41:29.921
You all represent the tops
and bottoms this week.

41:29.921 --> 41:31.723
The rest of you are safe.

41:31.723 --> 41:33.191
You may go untuck
in the werkroom.

41:35.593 --> 41:37.495
It is time for
the judges' critiques.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.897
First up, Suki Doll.

41:39.897 --> 41:43.668
I love this
kind of fun, Club Kid take

41:43.668 --> 41:45.503
on the circus theme.

41:45.503 --> 41:49.073
I adore your attention
to detail,

41:49.073 --> 41:50.141
but I really wish

41:50.141 --> 41:54.112
that you had brought
more of that to the challenge.

41:54.112 --> 41:55.880
There was some messiness
happening.

41:55.880 --> 41:59.650
I couldn't quite figure out
what had been directed to you

41:59.650 --> 42:02.253
and what was just kind of
being made up in the moment.

42:02.253 --> 42:03.755
Your group had the hardest part,

42:03.755 --> 42:05.189
because you had
the most group work,

42:05.189 --> 42:07.692
and there was
a lot of chaos going.

42:07.692 --> 42:09.861
And chaos is great for clowns,

42:09.861 --> 42:12.930
but there needs to be
organized chaos.

42:12.930 --> 42:17.635
Gia Metric, I have to say,
your performance as Himbo,

42:17.635 --> 42:21.038
you were just,
for me, Gia Mesmerizing.

42:21.038 --> 42:23.775
You gave me all
my eighties fantasies.

42:23.775 --> 42:27.478
You were electric, you had
your rock star poses down.

42:27.478 --> 42:31.215
I loved how much you brought
of your own self to it.

42:31.215 --> 42:33.918
And this look?
10s, baby, 10s.

42:33.918 --> 42:35.620
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

42:35.620 --> 42:37.922
Well, this week
I think it's safe to say

42:37.922 --> 42:39.757
you most definitely
understood the assignment.

42:39.757 --> 42:42.226
Oh, thank you so much.

42:42.226 --> 42:44.228
Kendall Gender.

42:44.228 --> 42:46.164
Correct me if I'm wrong,

42:46.164 --> 42:49.834
that perhaps you might not
be a singing queen?

42:49.834 --> 42:50.968
No. [laughs]

42:50.968 --> 42:52.970
But you took this challenge

42:52.970 --> 42:56.073
and you made it work for you
and you killed it.

42:56.073 --> 42:58.476
It's the commitment
that I loved.

42:58.476 --> 43:00.011
A singer you may not be,

43:00.011 --> 43:02.513
but a professional
you most certainly are.

43:02.513 --> 43:03.815
Tell me about this look,

43:03.815 --> 43:05.683
because I love
a showgirl's moment.

43:05.683 --> 43:08.219
It's kind of a blend
of a showgirl and a show pony.

43:08.219 --> 43:11.823
I like that duality, you know,
because you were animalistic,

43:11.823 --> 43:14.926
but yet you were also
very fabulous and glamorous.

43:14.926 --> 43:16.494
Can I get a neigh-men?

43:16.494 --> 43:18.963
Neigh-men!
[all laugh]

43:18.963 --> 43:21.065
Next, Icesis Couture.

43:21.065 --> 43:22.366
Hello.

43:22.366 --> 43:24.569
I'm gonna ask you
the age old question.

43:24.569 --> 43:25.636
How's your head?

43:25.636 --> 43:29.073
It's fine.
Thanks for asking.

43:29.073 --> 43:31.209
Because it didn't seem fine
in that challenge.

43:31.209 --> 43:33.277
You seemed very in your head.

43:33.277 --> 43:34.879
I did feel like Stephanie

43:34.879 --> 43:37.482
was maybe carrying you
a little bit in parts,

43:37.482 --> 43:40.551
instead of you
being a duo together.

43:40.551 --> 43:42.653
Unfortunately for me,
it's a no,

43:42.653 --> 43:46.190
especially since
you battled for this role.

43:46.190 --> 43:49.327
I thought I was a dancer,

43:49.327 --> 43:52.029
like a dancing queen
coming into this competition.

43:52.029 --> 43:54.031
And then I met Hollywood.

43:54.031 --> 43:55.867
Listen, I understand.

43:55.867 --> 43:57.368
His choreography is not easy.

43:57.368 --> 43:58.369
I mean, I don't even like

43:58.369 --> 44:00.571
walking behind him
on a runway, you know?

44:00.571 --> 44:02.139
Hollywood Jade is perfection.

44:02.139 --> 44:05.510
Your runways and your
presentations
are so polished.

44:05.510 --> 44:09.013
Just remember to also carry it
into the challenges.

44:09.013 --> 44:11.549
When you're doing something live
and you mess up,

44:11.549 --> 44:12.683
don't let us see it.

44:12.683 --> 44:15.119
I watched you mess up,
and then just go rrr.

44:15.119 --> 44:17.722
It was like you gave up,
and you're too good for that.

44:17.722 --> 44:19.023
Thank you.

44:19.023 --> 44:20.892
Eve 6000.

44:20.892 --> 44:25.129
Your runway look,
I'm gonna say it's purrfect.

44:25.129 --> 44:26.497
Incredible, so fun.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.533
Your presentation of it
was great.

44:28.533 --> 44:29.467
Thank you.

44:29.467 --> 44:31.269
But when it comes
to the challenge,

44:31.269 --> 44:33.504
it was just
very, very flat for me.

44:33.504 --> 44:34.605
Okay.

44:34.605 --> 44:37.608
I was feeling like you were
a little bit hesitant,

44:37.608 --> 44:39.610
a little unsure of yourself.

44:39.610 --> 44:41.512
I've never sang live
onstage before,

44:41.512 --> 44:45.516
so I was really, really, really
trying to get that first note

44:45.516 --> 44:48.920
and set myself up for, like,
a good vocal performance.

44:48.920 --> 44:50.655
Obviously
y'all are not singers.

44:50.655 --> 44:52.523
I can't even imagine
having to sing live,

44:52.523 --> 44:54.725
so I'm not sitting here trying
to critique your singing.

44:54.725 --> 44:56.527
It was the performance for me.

44:56.527 --> 44:59.530
It was supposed to be
super campy, super fun,

44:59.530 --> 45:02.066
and it just didn't hit the mark.

45:02.066 --> 45:04.101
I want to see more.

45:04.101 --> 45:06.203
I want to see Eve-n more.

45:06.203 --> 45:07.939
[laughs]

45:07.939 --> 45:10.374
You're fired.
[all laugh]

45:10.374 --> 45:12.043
Ocane Aqua-Black.

45:12.043 --> 45:13.711
Hi!

45:13.711 --> 45:16.781
What was it like working in a
trio
during the performance?

45:16.781 --> 45:19.317
We struggled.

45:19.317 --> 45:21.886
I felt that Suki and Adriana,

45:21.886 --> 45:23.087
they had their little group
going on,

45:23.087 --> 45:24.989
and you were kind of
off by yourself.

45:24.989 --> 45:29.627
I think that what happened is
that I lost my focus completely,

45:29.627 --> 45:31.462
so it took me out of the number.

45:31.462 --> 45:33.097
-Inner saboteur, honey.
-Yeah.

45:33.097 --> 45:35.066
I agree with
what the judges are saying,

45:35.066 --> 45:37.134
but you are a joy to watch,

45:37.134 --> 45:39.403
and I think you did
a really good job

45:39.403 --> 45:41.906
of interpreting
this runway challenge.

45:41.906 --> 45:42.807
Thank you so much.

45:42.807 --> 45:44.141
Pythia.

45:44.141 --> 45:46.377
This look has me seeing double.

45:46.377 --> 45:48.346
-[laughs]
-Flawless.

45:48.346 --> 45:50.214
It looks so much like you.

45:50.214 --> 45:52.383
You got the paint exact.

45:52.383 --> 45:54.418
It's sensational.

45:54.418 --> 45:58.322
When they say "the art of drag,"
this is what they mean.

45:58.322 --> 46:00.825
This is art head to toe.

46:00.825 --> 46:02.994
Loved your performance.
I thought it was great.

46:02.994 --> 46:06.664
You came onto the stage
ready to play.

46:06.664 --> 46:08.999
You were selling it with
your facial expressions,

46:08.999 --> 46:10.501
with your body, everything.

46:10.501 --> 46:12.937
You were that character.

46:12.937 --> 46:14.205
You scared the shit out of me.

46:14.205 --> 46:15.272
[laughs] Good.

46:15.272 --> 46:17.108
And it was just really easy
to get lost in your character,

46:17.108 --> 46:19.343
and I really, really enjoyed it.

46:19.343 --> 46:20.578
That means the world.

46:20.578 --> 46:23.280
I mean it.
Thank you so much.

46:23.280 --> 46:24.615
Thank you, queens.

46:24.615 --> 46:27.752
We have some very, very
tough decisions to make.

46:27.752 --> 46:30.021
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

46:30.021 --> 46:32.189
the judges will make
balloon animals.

46:37.294 --> 46:38.996
Hi!

46:38.996 --> 46:40.331
Hi, ladies.

46:40.331 --> 46:43.534
Come on in, tops and bottoms.

46:43.534 --> 46:45.536
-Ooh, my goodness.
-Oh, my God.

46:45.536 --> 46:47.505
So how's everyone doing?

46:47.505 --> 46:49.774
I am really, really upset.

46:49.774 --> 46:51.809
Like, slightly embarrassed.

46:51.809 --> 46:53.477
I mean, I won last week,

46:53.477 --> 46:57.348
and now I'm probably
going to be lip syncing.

46:57.348 --> 47:01.452
I'm really nervous after
what the judges have said.

47:01.452 --> 47:05.156
I'm really scared that today's
the day
that I'm gonna go home.

47:05.156 --> 47:08.125
So based on people's faces
when they walked in,

47:08.125 --> 47:11.195
I'm assuming you're winning,
you're winning, you're winning.

47:11.195 --> 47:12.897
Pythia, Kendall, and Gia.

47:12.897 --> 47:14.398
I think that's the top three

47:14.398 --> 47:16.734
that I sort of felt
from the vibe, yeah.

47:16.734 --> 47:18.069
Really? Is that
the impression you got?

47:18.069 --> 47:20.237
-I thought it was the opposite.
-Oh!

47:20.237 --> 47:22.173
Well, you do love delusion.

47:22.173 --> 47:23.674
[all laugh]

47:23.674 --> 47:26.444
My reveals didn't exactly
go as planned.

47:26.444 --> 47:29.480
However, I think that does work
for the character, so...

47:29.480 --> 47:31.882
But I do feel like
I did a really great job.

47:31.882 --> 47:32.950
The way that
they're critiquing it,

47:32.950 --> 47:34.852
they didn't judge you
for your singing.

47:34.852 --> 47:38.422
If I knew that it was okay
to just sing badly--

47:38.422 --> 47:40.491
[laughs]

47:40.491 --> 47:41.659
Eve, girl, really?

47:41.659 --> 47:43.828
We're doing this again?

47:43.828 --> 47:45.262
No offense,
but if I knew it was--

47:45.262 --> 47:48.065
You're in your feelings.
If you wanna slash, go ahead.

47:48.065 --> 47:49.400
No, I'm not doing that.

47:49.400 --> 47:52.303
I thought that they would have
been
judging the singing more.

47:53.804 --> 47:55.673
They weren't judging Kendall
on her singing

47:55.673 --> 47:59.877
because she took the role,
she made it her own.

47:59.877 --> 48:01.645
-I know.
-And she got on that stage,

48:01.645 --> 48:02.980
and just because
she couldn't sing,

48:02.980 --> 48:05.249
that didn't stop her from
shining bright
like a star.

48:05.249 --> 48:07.351
-No, I know, I'm not--
-No, no, no, but don't--

48:07.351 --> 48:10.354
don't be throwing,
like, shade at Kendall

48:10.354 --> 48:12.523
just because, like, you're
in your feelings right now.

48:12.523 --> 48:14.091
I don't need you guys
to gang up on me.

48:14.091 --> 48:15.226
What?

48:15.226 --> 48:17.394
Eve, no one
is ganging up on you.

48:17.394 --> 48:21.599
Gia is my fiery sister,
and she will always defend me,

48:21.599 --> 48:23.934
and I'm really not here
to be your punching bag.

48:23.934 --> 48:25.202
I do have something
to say to you actually,

48:25.202 --> 48:26.470
and I was gonna say this anyway.

48:26.470 --> 48:29.206
Eve, Eve. Eve!

48:29.206 --> 48:30.808
No, girl! No!

48:30.808 --> 48:33.511
I came into this,
and I was so happy to see you.

48:33.511 --> 48:35.379
But I feel like
since I've been here,

48:35.379 --> 48:37.114
I just kind of feel
like you ignore me.

48:37.114 --> 48:39.717
And I just feel like
you're kind of, like,

48:39.717 --> 48:43.220
in your own world
with, like, Gia and Synthia.

48:43.220 --> 48:44.488
Yeah, no shit.

48:44.488 --> 48:47.958
Obviously, Kendall, Synthia,
and I are going to be kiki-ing,

48:47.958 --> 48:49.226
be having conversations
together,

48:49.226 --> 48:52.463
doing our makeup together,
because we're family.

48:52.463 --> 48:54.165
I just kind of feel like
every time I try to talk to you,

48:54.165 --> 48:55.533
you kind of just
don't pay attention to me.

48:55.533 --> 48:57.668
Oh.

48:57.668 --> 49:01.672
I don't know where exactly
this is coming from.

49:01.672 --> 49:02.740
Well, I'm really sorry
that you feel like that.

49:02.740 --> 49:04.942
I genuinely am not that person.

49:04.942 --> 49:05.976
Yeah, but that's
just my opinion,

49:05.976 --> 49:09.547
and I've been wrong
many times, so... [laughs]

49:09.547 --> 49:11.515
Nobody in here hates you.

49:11.515 --> 49:13.317
Well, I didn't say
everybody hates me,

49:13.317 --> 49:14.485
but now that you guys
are saying that--

49:14.485 --> 49:16.420
Bitch, we hate you!
[all laugh]

49:19.790 --> 49:24.395
Just between us Debbie Clowners,
what do we think?

49:24.395 --> 49:25.963
Starting with Suki.

49:25.963 --> 49:27.464
It wasn't the role
that she wanted,

49:27.464 --> 49:29.366
and I think she struggled
with that.

49:29.366 --> 49:32.169
But I think that
she really, really tried.

49:32.169 --> 49:35.105
Her runway look was spectacular.

49:35.105 --> 49:37.575
Also, to be able
to walk the runway

49:37.575 --> 49:39.410
in, like, 10-inch platform boots
like that,

49:39.410 --> 49:40.878
you gotta take that
into consideration.

49:40.878 --> 49:43.314
David Bowie would be proud.

49:43.314 --> 49:45.583
Now let's talk Gia Metric.

49:45.583 --> 49:46.817
Performance: perfection.

49:46.817 --> 49:50.020
Himbo was the star
of that performance.

49:50.020 --> 49:53.090
She committed wholeheartedly,
and I bought all of it.

49:53.090 --> 49:54.425
I wanted to subscribe.

49:54.425 --> 49:55.359
The runway was really good, too.

49:55.359 --> 49:58.195
My only issue
is I'd seen it all before.

49:58.195 --> 49:59.096
Mm.

49:59.096 --> 50:00.998
Up next, we have Icesis Couture.

50:00.998 --> 50:05.135
Icesis' performance as Lace
was lackluster for me.

50:05.135 --> 50:06.904
I really wanted to see

50:06.904 --> 50:10.140
that mean girl, sarcastic,
almost bitchy energy,

50:10.140 --> 50:11.809
and you can't give that

50:11.809 --> 50:14.178
if you're not confident
in your dance moves.

50:14.178 --> 50:16.680
Once the train
was off the track,

50:16.680 --> 50:18.249
it never got back on.

50:18.249 --> 50:20.484
She won last week,
and she was incredible.

50:20.484 --> 50:22.853
And tonight on the runway,
she looked incredible,

50:22.853 --> 50:25.522
But to see her perform
for the first time,

50:25.522 --> 50:28.292
I was like, oh,
are you just a look queen?

50:28.292 --> 50:30.427
Up next, we have Kendall Gender.

50:30.427 --> 50:33.297
She really overcame
that obstacle

50:33.297 --> 50:35.232
of not being able to sing.

50:35.232 --> 50:36.600
She made it her own,

50:36.600 --> 50:39.870
and she brought us along
on the journey with her.

50:39.870 --> 50:42.006
She was a show pony,
and I give her props.

50:42.006 --> 50:44.508
Yes, it was a really
great week for her.

50:44.508 --> 50:46.510
Up next, Eve 6000.

50:46.510 --> 50:48.479
I felt like she was hesitant,

50:48.479 --> 50:52.182
and I really wanted to see her
command her performance.

50:52.182 --> 50:55.052
The character's name
was Revealiana,

50:55.052 --> 50:57.688
and yet the reveals
weren't executed.

50:57.688 --> 50:59.223
But then she came out here
in this look,

50:59.223 --> 51:01.458
and I'm just like,
there's the humor.

51:01.458 --> 51:03.594
That's what we needed
in the challenge.

51:03.594 --> 51:07.131
Ocane Aqua-Black
from the Haus of the Ocean.

51:07.131 --> 51:09.366
Ocane as Bong,

51:09.366 --> 51:13.037
I felt like Ocane
was on the outside looking in.

51:13.037 --> 51:15.439
I was so excited
when I saw her walk out

51:15.439 --> 51:17.374
in that little crop top
and the wig.

51:17.374 --> 51:18.909
She looked so silly,

51:18.909 --> 51:20.611
and I was like,
oh, this is gonna be good.

51:20.611 --> 51:22.546
And then it just
kept falling flat.

51:22.546 --> 51:24.848
She didn't get
any of the choreography.

51:24.848 --> 51:25.749
None of it.

51:25.749 --> 51:27.184
And it was just
really disappointing,

51:27.184 --> 51:28.352
because there's something
about her.

51:28.352 --> 51:30.421
Every time she laughs,
I can't help but laugh.

51:30.421 --> 51:33.190
It just felt to me
like Ocane hit an iceberg.

51:33.190 --> 51:36.260
Her look, though, did not sink,

51:36.260 --> 51:38.595
but I'm not sure
it's enough to save her.

51:38.595 --> 51:41.365
And last but certainly
not least, Pythia.

51:41.365 --> 51:42.533
She really understood

51:42.533 --> 51:46.103
what Hennywise was
supposed to do on that stage.

51:46.103 --> 51:47.972
The look, the energy, the dance.

51:47.972 --> 51:50.074
We put her
with the dancing queens,

51:50.074 --> 51:53.377
and she basically
out-danced the queens.

51:53.377 --> 51:56.847
And then that runway look,
are you fucking kidding me?

51:56.847 --> 51:59.917
How dare she come out
in that runway look.

51:59.917 --> 52:00.818
The gumption.

52:00.818 --> 52:02.019
-The gumption.
-The gall!

52:02.019 --> 52:03.387
Oh, my goodness.

52:03.387 --> 52:04.822
A two-headed star is born.

52:04.822 --> 52:08.726
If that is any indication
of what Pythia can do,

52:08.726 --> 52:12.563
she's definitely someone to keep
an eye on in this competition.

52:12.563 --> 52:14.665
Season 2, week two,

52:14.665 --> 52:16.834
and if this is the caliber
of talent,

52:16.834 --> 52:18.969
good luck, kids, okay?

52:18.969 --> 52:20.004
Good luck.

52:20.004 --> 52:23.007
We have a very big decision
to make.

52:23.007 --> 52:26.210
Bring back our bearded ladies.

52:27.778 --> 52:29.346
Welcome back, queens.

52:29.346 --> 52:32.816
We have made
some very tough decisions.

52:34.051 --> 52:35.019
Kendall Gender.

52:36.253 --> 52:37.454
You are safe.

52:37.454 --> 52:38.522
Thank you.

52:38.522 --> 52:40.591
You may move
to the back of the stage.

52:42.159 --> 52:43.360
Eve 6000.

52:44.595 --> 52:46.597
-You are safe.
-Okay.

52:46.597 --> 52:48.232
I am completely gagged.

52:48.232 --> 52:50.667
-Thank you.
-Thank that runway look.

52:50.667 --> 52:51.635
Gia Metric.

52:51.635 --> 52:55.472
Your performance
in the Rusical paid the rent,

52:55.472 --> 52:57.841
and your look on the runway
made us pitch a tent.

52:59.076 --> 53:03.914
Pythia. In the Rusical
your scary clown left us dead,

53:03.914 --> 53:08.285
and on the runway,
you gave us amazing head...s.

53:08.285 --> 53:09.553
[laughs]

53:09.553 --> 53:11.055
Con-drag-ulations, my dear.

53:11.055 --> 53:13.157
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

53:13.157 --> 53:16.260
You are the winner
of this week's maxi-challenge.

53:16.260 --> 53:18.395
I won! [laughs]

53:18.395 --> 53:20.064
I'm so excited.

53:20.064 --> 53:23.067
You have won
a $5.000 gift certificate,

53:23.067 --> 53:25.302
courtesy of Peoples Jewelers.

53:25.302 --> 53:27.071
Oh, my God, I get diamonds?

53:27.071 --> 53:28.272
Diamonds!

53:28.272 --> 53:29.306
Bling-bling!

53:29.306 --> 53:31.275
[chuckles]

53:31.275 --> 53:33.243
You may join your sisters
at the back of the stage,

53:33.243 --> 53:34.678
both of you.

53:34.678 --> 53:35.712
[laughs]

53:35.712 --> 53:40.017
[applause]

53:40.017 --> 53:41.985
Gia, you are safe.

53:41.985 --> 53:43.053
Thank you, judges.

53:47.724 --> 53:48.792
Ocane.

53:48.792 --> 53:52.262
Your personality
really floats our boat,

53:52.262 --> 53:54.698
but in the Rusical,

53:54.698 --> 53:57.568
you sink, sank, sunk.

53:58.735 --> 54:01.905
Ocane, I'm so sorry, my dear,

54:01.905 --> 54:03.907
but you are up for elimination.

54:05.309 --> 54:06.243
Suki Doll.

54:06.243 --> 54:09.580
On the runway,
you always strike a fierce pose,

54:09.580 --> 54:14.585
but tonight in the Rusical,
you just froze.

54:14.585 --> 54:15.752
Icesis Couture.

54:15.752 --> 54:18.288
We always see your spark,

54:18.288 --> 54:22.559
but in the Rusical,
you really missed the mark.

54:22.559 --> 54:25.762
Suki Doll, you are safe.

54:25.762 --> 54:28.298
Whoo!

54:28.298 --> 54:29.666
Thank you.

54:29.666 --> 54:31.135
You may join the other queens.

54:31.135 --> 54:32.269
Thank you.

54:35.606 --> 54:37.941
Icesis, I'm sorry,

54:37.941 --> 54:40.644
but that means
you are up for elimination.

54:40.644 --> 54:43.347
[exhales]

54:43.347 --> 54:45.015
No!

54:45.015 --> 54:47.718
To go, like,
straight to the bottom

54:47.718 --> 54:50.053
is just really hard.

54:50.053 --> 54:52.122
[cries]

54:52.122 --> 54:54.658
Two queens stand before us.

54:56.593 --> 54:57.694
Prior to tonight,

54:57.694 --> 55:00.297
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

55:00.297 --> 55:02.966
of Stupid Shit by Girlicious.

55:02.966 --> 55:06.737
This is your last chance
to impress the judges

55:06.737 --> 55:09.773
and save yourself
from elimination.

55:11.942 --> 55:15.045
The time has come...
[thunder]

55:15.045 --> 55:17.714
for you to lip sync...

55:17.714 --> 55:18.682
for your life.

55:20.017 --> 55:22.219
Even if I stumbled a little bit,

55:22.219 --> 55:25.088
I am a force
to be reckoned with.

55:25.088 --> 55:27.024
I'm gonna give them a show.

55:27.024 --> 55:30.327
I need to shake off
these emotions that I'm having

55:30.327 --> 55:33.096
and fight for my place
to stay here.

55:33.096 --> 55:37.000
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.037
[music plays]

55:40.037 --> 55:42.206

-Ooh. Uh-oh.

57:56.473 --> 57:58.408
Thank you.

You may join the other queens.

-I love you, too.

58:08.218 --> 58:10.253
My sea-sickening queen,

58:10.253 --> 58:14.791
Ocane levels are rising,
and so is your star.

58:14.791 --> 58:17.728
Thank you for
the extraordinary opportunity.

58:17.728 --> 58:21.164
Now sashay away.

But it was just
not my challenge.

58:42.452 --> 58:46.289
The ocean is rising and
she's coming to a city near you,

58:46.289 --> 58:47.891

and to be vulnerable.
