00:06.680 --> 00:09.920
(Carter) Looks like it was once
an advanced civilisation, sir.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.360
- (Daniel) No survivors.
- (O'Neill) No bodies, either.

00:13.440 --> 00:17.920
(Daniel) Based on the overgrowth, I guess
this place was destroyed a long time ago.

00:25.640 --> 00:28.800
(Carter) Faint energy readings
definitely coming from here.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.480
Nothing dangerous, as far as I can tell.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074

01:08.160 --> 01:10.560
(Daniel) She's perfectly preserved.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.680
This must be some sort of
tomb or crypt of some kind.

01:16.880 --> 01:19.040
(Carter) Or a science lab.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.040
Why would you say that?

01:21.120 --> 01:25.840
Cos these energy readings I'm getting
seem to be coming from her.

02:45.880 --> 02:48.040
It's Colonel O'Neill, sir.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.880
- General.
- Colonel. What do you have to report?

02:50.960 --> 02:53.800
Yeah, confirming initial MALP recon.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.360
The place is pretty much toast.

02:56.440 --> 03:00.240
However, Carter did find something.

03:03.280 --> 03:07.560
- Care to expand on that?
- She thinks it's a robot, sir.

03:07.640 --> 03:11.560
Sir, I'm positive this is
some sort of artificial life form,

03:11.640 --> 03:14.800
but I can't be sure of anything more
under these conditions.

03:14.880 --> 03:18.440
Request permission to bring it back
to the SGC for further evaluation.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.680
Can you assure me that will be safe?

03:20.760 --> 03:24.920
It appears to be inactive, sir. I'm getting
only very faint energy readings.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.680
I believe we could isolate it safely.
It is definitely worth examining.

03:28.760 --> 03:31.360
It also may be the last remnants
of the civilisation,

03:31.440 --> 03:34.680
and the key to finding out
exactly what happened here, sir.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.880
- Very well. Bring it through.
- Thank you.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.400
- (Carter) Thank you.
- (Daniel) Out, sir.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.920
- Hey, Janet.
- Hey. How's the new toy?

04:01.000 --> 04:05.080
Amazing. This is more advanced than
any android we've encountered before.

04:05.160 --> 04:07.200
Check this out.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.520
That some sort of nanotechnology?

04:14.600 --> 04:17.680
They seem to be some sort of
self-repair mechanism.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.680
Yeah, but they're inactive.

04:19.760 --> 04:24.160
They seem to deactivate
when disconnected from it... or her.

04:27.040 --> 04:31.040
According to the ultrasonic scan,
the power system is centred here.

04:31.120 --> 04:35.360
There seems to be some sort of
mechanism to access it from the outside.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.840
I was just about to try it out.

04:40.520 --> 04:41.920
Wow.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.240
The Greeks, Romans, Babylonians

04:49.320 --> 04:51.960
envisioned synthetic beings
with human behaviour

04:52.040 --> 04:55.200
long before the words "robot"
or "android" were ever uttered.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.480
Yeah. So?

04:56.560 --> 04:59.520
So it's been our nature
to seek immortality

04:59.600 --> 05:02.720
through the creation of vessels
for our consciousness.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.320
Vessels?

05:04.400 --> 05:06.000
Colonel O'Neill, Dr Jackson.

05:06.080 --> 05:10.240
Major Carter and I were just discussing
whether or not to activate the robot.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.400
You can?

05:11.480 --> 05:14.360
I think I've found a way
to recharge the main power cell.

05:14.440 --> 05:17.680
Prior to this, it's been operating
on less than 1% capacity.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.680
I'm hoping that was enough
to maintain the memory systems,

05:20.760 --> 05:22.960
assuming it had any
to begin with, of course.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.440
Of course. Why do you
wanna do this again?

05:25.520 --> 05:28.600
Sir, this is an incredibly
advanced piece of technology.

05:28.880 --> 05:33.320
Given enough time, I might be able to
figure out how some of its functions work.

05:33.400 --> 05:37.720
The neurological system seems to be
as complex as a human brain.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.640
So?

05:42.080 --> 05:45.840
So, I'm hoping that the robot will be able

05:45.920 --> 05:50.360
to help me understand... itself, sir.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.440
Now what?

06:21.520 --> 06:25.320
I don't know. The power cell
should be fully charged.

06:25.400 --> 06:28.400
As far as I can tell,
there isn't an "on" switch.

06:29.920 --> 06:33.000
It's possible the power
was depleted for too long.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.440
Why don't you kiss her?

06:39.400 --> 06:40.600
(gasps)

06:44.680 --> 06:47.280
- There's a pulse.
- It has a heartbeat?

06:48.200 --> 06:49.800
It has a heart?

06:49.880 --> 06:54.360
It's designed to create
a very realistic illusion of humanity.

06:58.720 --> 06:59.920
Where am I?

07:00.000 --> 07:04.240
You're in a special facility on the planet
Earth. My name is Daniel Jackson.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.880
This is Major Samantha Carter
and Jack O'Neill.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.080
Hi.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.560
My name is Reese.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.840
- Where's my father?
- We're not sure.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.600
Please just let me explain.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.920
- Don't hurt me.
- No one wants to hurt you.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.640
- How did I get here?
- Um...

07:31.520 --> 07:34.960
We found you on your planet,
we brought you through the Stargate.

07:35.040 --> 07:38.160
- What is that?
- (Carter) There was one on your planet.

07:38.240 --> 07:41.520
It can be used to travel
great distances through space.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.800
We can tell you more about it later.

07:45.320 --> 07:47.920
Why did you bring me here?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.600
I suppose there's
no easy way to tell you this,

07:50.680 --> 07:54.080
but the civilisation
on your planet was destroyed.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.680
- How?
- We don't know.

07:58.760 --> 08:02.240
We were sort of hoping you could tell us.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.800
l, uh...

08:07.200 --> 08:11.000
- I was asleep.
- Yes, we found you that way.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.880
What about my father?

08:14.160 --> 08:18.080
Well, as far as we could tell,
you were the only survivor.

08:23.480 --> 08:26.480
You don't know anything
about what happened?

08:28.480 --> 08:33.280
My father knew there was danger.
He told me to go to sleep.

08:33.360 --> 08:36.520
He said he would wake me
when the danger went away.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.919
We're very sorry.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.000
What do you want?

08:45.080 --> 08:48.400
Well, we want to understand.

08:49.520 --> 08:53.320
- What?
- Your planet and its history and...

08:53.400 --> 08:56.440
- You.
- What about me?

08:56.520 --> 08:59.920
Well, I'd really like to know
more about how you work.

09:03.440 --> 09:06.560
Your systems, how they function.

09:06.640 --> 09:10.800
- I'm like you.
- Uh, not exactly.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.880
At least as far as I can tell.

09:14.240 --> 09:17.440
- How are we different?
- Sam, can I have... can I have a word?

09:17.520 --> 09:19.080
Yeah.

09:19.160 --> 09:22.840
We're just gonna step outside
for a minute. Will you be OK?

09:22.920 --> 09:24.920
We'll be right back.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.400
Excuse me.

09:41.200 --> 09:44.120
I don't think she knows she's a robot.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.600
OK, how is that possible?

09:46.680 --> 09:51.920
When your consciousness was copied
into a robot, you didn't know right away.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.440
What are you suggesting?

09:53.520 --> 09:56.000
We shouldn't reveal
the reality of her existence

09:56.080 --> 09:59.480
moments after telling her
her planet was destroyed.

10:00.240 --> 10:02.040
Why?

10:03.240 --> 10:05.440
It's a machine.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.200
She just found out her father is dead.

10:08.280 --> 10:11.400
- It's a machine.
- He's right.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.280
- It's not like it ever had a real father.
- Maybe not.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.720
Maybe it's her creator.
Or maybe we're talking to

10:17.800 --> 10:20.800
the consciousness of a human being
who once had a father.

10:20.880 --> 10:25.440
We should be careful about deciding
what is and what isn't a life form.

10:25.520 --> 10:30.600
I agree. All I'm saying is, if she doesn't
know what she is, she has a right to.

10:30.680 --> 10:33.680
OK. Maybe we should wait a while.

10:33.760 --> 10:36.440
I mean, she did seem pretty upset.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.600
For a machine.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.480
We don't know what
psychological effect it will have.

10:41.560 --> 10:42.800
Psychological?

10:42.880 --> 10:46.680
Whether her behaviour is a result
of sophisticated programming or not,

10:46.760 --> 10:50.360
the best way to find out about her and
what she knows is by dealing with her

10:50.440 --> 10:52.840
on her own terms, at least for now.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.320
Couldn't hurt.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.320
- It doesn't make any sense.
- Which part?

11:05.400 --> 11:08.480
Why would somebody
destroy an entire civilisation,

11:08.560 --> 11:12.840
but leave one piece of incredibly
advanced technology intact?

11:12.920 --> 11:14.720
That's what he's figuring out.

11:14.800 --> 11:19.280
What I'm saying is, maybe there's
something on the planet that we missed.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.800
I'll go back.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.440
Is the rest of your planet like this place?

11:28.520 --> 11:30.520
No, it's very different.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.240
What's it like?

11:34.320 --> 11:37.680
There's lots of varying climates,
different landscapes,

11:37.760 --> 11:41.040
big oceans, a wide range of civilisations.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.960
And each is home to
a lot of different kinds of people.

11:44.400 --> 11:47.920
- It sounds beautiful.
- Much of it is.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.160
Can I see it?

11:53.240 --> 11:55.320
Soon.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.040
Why not now?

11:57.120 --> 12:00.040
Well, because we still have
more to talk about, Reese.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.800
I know, but, you know,
we've been talking for so long now.

12:03.880 --> 12:08.680
I know, but you must know a lot more
than what we've already talked about.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.480
I do know a lot.

12:25.680 --> 12:29.920
What can you tell me about the danger
that came to your planet?

12:48.920 --> 12:52.920
Well, this may have turned out
to be one colossal waste of time.

12:54.360 --> 12:57.560
- You boys find anything?
- Just lots of debris.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.680
I think our work is done here.

12:59.760 --> 13:02.200
You said to look for
anything uncharacteristic

13:02.280 --> 13:04.440
of the indigenous technology, right?

13:05.640 --> 13:09.040
I would never say
anything like that, Major.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.040
Right.

13:11.120 --> 13:15.600
Major Carter said not to ignore anything,
however insignificant it may seem.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.080
- What have you got?
- I'm sure it's nothing,

13:18.160 --> 13:20.360
but we found a bunch of these.

13:20.440 --> 13:23.240
I've never seen anything like them before.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.400
You know what they are?

13:37.480 --> 13:39.480
Oh, yeah.

13:50.440 --> 13:54.480
No energy readings.
I'd say these blocks are dead.

13:54.560 --> 13:57.440
Probably been on the planet
since it was destroyed.

13:57.520 --> 14:00.080
Replicators were the cause
of the destruction?

14:00.160 --> 14:02.880
The first evidence
of the replicators in this galaxy.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.280
That must have been a long time ago.

14:05.360 --> 14:10.400
Something still doesn't fit. The replicators
we know go after advanced technology.

14:10.480 --> 14:14.680
Why would they eat everything
on the planet and leave Reese alone?

14:15.640 --> 14:18.320
Perhaps she has some means
of defending herself.

14:18.680 --> 14:19.920
She was asleep.

14:20.280 --> 14:24.400
It's possible that she's giving off
a signal or frequency that repels them,

14:24.480 --> 14:27.160
maybe not even by design,
but by coincidence.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.640
Bug spray?

14:28.720 --> 14:33.600
Reese herself may be the key to helping
us in our fight against the replicators.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.480
Yeah, maybe, but we're still
a long way from determining that.

14:37.560 --> 14:41.440
- Dr Jackson, what have you learned?
- Well, actually, not much, sir.

14:41.520 --> 14:44.800
She's hard to pin down in a conversation,
her attention wanders.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.480
It's like she has the mind of a child.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.120
What?

14:57.320 --> 15:00.760
I'm not sure, but she may not be
telling me everything she knows.

15:01.080 --> 15:04.680
- You think she's hiding something?
- I get that feeling.

15:05.240 --> 15:08.280
Why would someone create a robot
with the mind of a child?

15:08.360 --> 15:12.960
Well, like Daniel suggested,
it could be a transferred consciousness,

15:13.040 --> 15:16.320
or it could be that the creator
intended for her to be mature,

15:16.400 --> 15:18.600
but couldn't get the programming right.

15:18.680 --> 15:21.080
But if she is hiding something,

15:21.160 --> 15:24.080
we should proceed carefully
with further interactions.

15:24.160 --> 15:28.040
Sir, I think it's time
that we told Reese the truth.

15:29.520 --> 15:34.600
Daniel, maybe if she's forced to confront
the fact that she's an artificial life form,

15:34.680 --> 15:39.280
it could change any pre-program
priorities that she's adhering to.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.680
- I'm so happy you're here.
- What's that?

15:51.760 --> 15:54.520
Oh, I made it. Do you like it?

15:54.600 --> 15:57.160
It's very nice. How did you make this?

15:57.240 --> 16:00.800
I'm so tired of this room, Daniel.
Can I please go outside?

16:00.880 --> 16:03.880
Sit down for a minute, Reese.
We need to talk.

16:09.640 --> 16:13.000
- No.
- This'll just take a minute. Sit down.

16:13.080 --> 16:16.400
I don't wanna talk any more. I wanna
have fun! Don't you ever have fun?

16:16.480 --> 16:19.760
Not as much as I'd like to.
This is very important. Sit!

16:19.840 --> 16:22.840
- Then can we have some fun? Promise?
- Yes.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.520
OK, um...

16:26.320 --> 16:29.480
Reese, you know there are
different kinds of people, right?

16:29.800 --> 16:30.960
Of course.

16:31.040 --> 16:35.560
In fact, there are many
different kinds of life forms.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.720
This is boring.

16:37.800 --> 16:41.520
I'm starting to identify
with this girl more and more.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.040
Reese, I know you think that
we're the same, but we're not.

16:45.120 --> 16:49.320
- My father always said I was special.
- You are. You are very special.

16:50.680 --> 16:55.960
But despite the fact that you and I look
very much the same, we're very different.

16:56.040 --> 16:59.720
- That's obvious.
- I mean on the inside.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.960
How?

17:05.839 --> 17:08.440
Well, I am flesh and blood.

17:09.880 --> 17:12.160
You are a machine.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.960
A very, very sophisticated machine.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.839
More of a... a computer, really.

17:25.040 --> 17:29.040
- I'm alive.
- Yes, you are, just not like me.

17:30.080 --> 17:33.640
Even though you were created to be
very human-like, you are not human.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.120
Yes, I am!

17:39.160 --> 17:42.120
No, you're not, Reese, OK?
I can prove that to you.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.400
No!

17:49.040 --> 17:53.040
I wanna leave you!
Let me out! Let me out! Now!

17:55.840 --> 17:58.400
Hey, that went well.

17:58.480 --> 18:03.160
Maybe her programming prevents her
acknowledging she's anything but human.

18:03.240 --> 18:05.920
Robot denial?

18:06.320 --> 18:07.920
Looks that way.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.120
Has it occurred to anyone that this thing
may have been laying around that planet

18:12.200 --> 18:16.360
for, oh, quite some time,
and that maybe it's broken?

18:16.440 --> 18:20.400
Or perhaps it never
worked right in the first place?

18:20.480 --> 18:22.640
- Should we shut her down?
- I don't know.

18:22.720 --> 18:26.280
Let's ask the man who just
had his head cracked open.

18:26.360 --> 18:29.080
She didn't mean to hurt me.
She didn't like what I said.

18:29.160 --> 18:32.040
I don't like most of what you say.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.800
I try to resist the urge
to shove you through a wall.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.680
Somehow Reese managed to survive
a massive attack from replicators.

18:38.760 --> 18:41.960
There has to be more
that we can learn from her, sir.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.760
Finally!

18:58.720 --> 19:01.680
Do you forgive me? You know
I didn't mean to hurt you, right?

19:01.760 --> 19:03.800
- I know.
- Good.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.960
- I forgive you, too.
- What?

19:07.040 --> 19:09.080
- What?
- For attacking me.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.960
I didn't attack you, Reese.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.720
- It doesn't matter. Let's forget it.
- No, we should talk about this.

19:17.800 --> 19:21.560
No, please, Daniel. I'm so bored.
I just wanna get out of here.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.920
I wanna see your world.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.120
Why are you all so afraid of me?

19:26.960 --> 19:30.080
- No one's afraid of you.
- I won't do anything bad, I promise.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.080
I know.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.760
- I made you something.
- Yeah?

19:35.840 --> 19:38.760
Remember you said you wished
you could have more fun?

19:38.840 --> 19:39.920
Yeah.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.360
Don't be afraid. It's just a toy.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.720
(Carter) That glass is acid-resistant,

20:17.800 --> 20:21.200
but it hasn't been tested
against replicator spray.

20:23.480 --> 20:26.880
Why are we keeping this thing, anyway?
We know what they can do.

20:26.960 --> 20:30.040
- She made it. She can control it.
- Yes, but how did she make it?

20:30.120 --> 20:32.720
Well, I think I have a pretty good idea.

20:51.280 --> 20:55.040
Nanotechnology. The nanobots
that she uses for self-repair

20:55.120 --> 20:59.120
are apparently able to reorder matter
on a microscopic level.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.760
She understands
their construction completely.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.920
She should know how to defeat them.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.720
- Will she tell us?
- That's the problem.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.240
What?

21:08.320 --> 21:10.920
- She's not talking.
- We make her talk.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.360
I think she was offended
because I didn't appreciate her present.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.640
This is so far beyond my understanding.

21:17.720 --> 21:21.120
I recommend that we contact the Asgard.
Maybe they can help.

21:21.200 --> 21:24.040
Agreed. I'll send SG-2
to try and make contact.

21:24.120 --> 21:26.600
In the meantime,
see what else you can learn.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.280
Yes, sir.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.520
Reese, we need to talk.

21:48.360 --> 21:51.280
(O'Neill) Tell us what you know
about the replicators.

21:51.360 --> 21:53.960
- (Reese) Replicators?
- Yeah.

21:54.040 --> 21:57.480
(O'Neill) It's what we call them
because that's what they do.

21:57.560 --> 22:00.320
It's just a toy. It won't hurt you.

22:00.400 --> 22:05.240
A toy? There are millions of
those things floating around in space,

22:05.320 --> 22:08.080
destroying everything they touch.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.120
- I don't know what you mean.
- They destroyed your planet.

22:11.200 --> 22:14.280
And don't tell me you don't remember
because I think you do.

22:14.360 --> 22:16.440
No, you wanna destroy me!

22:18.840 --> 22:20.760
- Easy.
- No one wants to hurt you.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.160
Tell us what happened.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.160
It wasn't my fault.

22:34.240 --> 22:37.240
The people on my planet were afraid.

22:37.320 --> 22:40.480
They wanted to destroy my toys.
They wanted to destroy me.

22:41.600 --> 22:45.840
They said that my father made me wrong.
They thought that I was bad.

22:46.560 --> 22:49.400
What did you do?

22:49.480 --> 22:52.280
I taught my toys
to make more of themselves.

22:53.120 --> 22:58.320
And I... I... I taught them
to defend themselves... and me...

22:59.320 --> 23:03.600
- In case anyone ever tried to destroy us.
- Well, you taught them well.

23:04.200 --> 23:07.280
When your toys attacked your world,
why didn't you stop them?

23:07.560 --> 23:09.960
I tried, but I couldn't.

23:11.960 --> 23:14.960
They wouldn't listen to me any more.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.840
Why did you go to sleep?

23:27.280 --> 23:31.600
They killed everyone.
They killed my father.

23:31.680 --> 23:34.520
And then they went away.

23:34.600 --> 23:37.840
I was alone. I was sad.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.560
You don't like me any more.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.320
You think I'm bad.

23:50.400 --> 23:52.640
Actually, we want you to help us.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.200
The replicators are a problem
for a lot of worlds.

23:55.280 --> 23:58.880
- We need to know how to stop them.
- You want to destroy them.

23:58.960 --> 24:01.800
- Yes.
- They're bad. They have to be stopped.

24:01.880 --> 24:03.680
- You want to destroy me!
- No.

24:03.760 --> 24:07.720
Yes, you do! You think that
my father made me wrong. You hate me!

24:38.040 --> 24:42.880
SG-2 has been unable to contact
the Asgard from the Katal hall of wisdom.

24:42.960 --> 24:46.200
- Nothing?
- I hope they're OK.

24:46.280 --> 24:49.440
It would be unfortunate
if the Asgard lost to the replicators

24:49.520 --> 24:52.800
at a time when we may have the key
to stopping them in our midst.

24:52.880 --> 24:55.440
I wouldn't count
the little fellers out just yet.

24:55.520 --> 24:58.320
Sir, this robot is far beyond
our understanding.

24:58.400 --> 25:02.360
We may be able to fight the replicators,
but without the Asgard's help

25:02.440 --> 25:07.520
I don't think we'll figure out how to use
Reese to defeat them on a grand scale.

25:07.600 --> 25:11.480
- The robot's unwilling to cooperate?
- Completely clammed up, sir.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.160
She thinks we don't like her.

25:13.240 --> 25:16.600
Her impression is her people
thought she was poorly constructed

25:16.680 --> 25:18.640
and wanted her and her toys eliminated.

25:18.720 --> 25:22.360
Which would make them
far smarter than we are.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.880
Whoever made Reese
made a critical error.

25:24.960 --> 25:29.240
He made her smart enough to build the
replicators and yet emotionally immature.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.000
She's just defending herself.

25:31.080 --> 25:35.480
She's a kid who unwittingly taught her
toys to become a weapon of destruction.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.800
Maybe.

25:38.400 --> 25:40.800
She's been lying to us from the start.

25:40.880 --> 25:44.400
Major, it sounds to me like
we're over our heads here.

25:44.480 --> 25:49.880
Until we successfully contact the Asgard,
I am ordering you to shut the robot down.

25:51.680 --> 25:55.480
- Well, that's not gonna be pretty.
- Do whatever's necessary.

26:29.480 --> 26:33.200
The cameras in Isolation Room One
are offline, and I can't get them back.

26:33.280 --> 26:35.240
We got it.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.880
The cameras are down.

26:38.280 --> 26:39.760
(mechanism jamming)

26:48.160 --> 26:50.360
They're in here!

26:55.280 --> 26:57.920
- (yelling)
- (gunfire)

27:00.960 --> 27:02.960
(screaming)

27:10.880 --> 27:12.880
(alarm)

27:21.200 --> 27:24.080
- They're alive. A medical team's coming.
- Where is she?

27:24.160 --> 27:27.680
The door was open and the prisoner
was gone when I arrived, sir.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.760
Replicators.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.440
O'Neill for Hammond.

27:33.200 --> 27:36.320
Yes, sir, we may have
a replicator situation down here.

27:36.400 --> 27:39.880
I suggest sealing the base
and doing a clean sweep.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.840
Yes, sir.

27:41.920 --> 27:45.080
And we also have a robot on the loose.

27:45.160 --> 27:47.840
Sir, we have to preserve her in one piece.

27:47.920 --> 27:50.920
And we'd like it in one piece, if possible.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.520
Yes, sir.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.400
How did this happen?

27:55.480 --> 28:00.000
The room is clear of any substance that
may be used to create another replicator.

28:00.080 --> 28:03.480
She must have made enough blocks
for two of them the first time.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.760
There could be hundreds by now.

28:45.840 --> 28:49.880
They've breached the power system, sir.
Initiating computer lockdown.

28:49.960 --> 28:53.200
Will it stop a replicator from
accessing the dialling computer?

28:53.280 --> 28:56.080
I doubt it, sir,
but it might buy us a little time.

28:57.680 --> 29:00.920
(woman) Major Carter, security
has been breached on level 28.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.480
Replicators are heading
to the control room.

29:03.560 --> 29:04.960
Roger that.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.080
Suggest retreating
until backup arrives, sir.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.560
- (door closing)
- Sir.

29:59.240 --> 30:02.760
She's sealed in the gate room.
She's got a lot of replicators with her.

30:02.840 --> 30:05.440
- She's probably trying to go home.
- Let's let her.

30:05.520 --> 30:09.320
- Sir, we can't just let her leave.
- We'll tell the Asgard where she is.

30:09.400 --> 30:13.080
I'm guessing. If she thinks we'll destroy
her she could be going anywhere.

30:13.400 --> 30:17.520
We can't let her go. She lost control of
the replicators once. It can happen again.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.000
So we'll toss a nuke in behind her.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.000
I'd like to try and stop her first.

30:24.280 --> 30:25.720
How?

30:25.800 --> 30:29.720
- Maybe get her trust back.
- Then what?

30:29.800 --> 30:33.080
Then... then I don't know.
I'm just making this up as I go.

30:33.160 --> 30:37.280
If you could get close enough to her, you
might be able to remove her power chip.

30:37.640 --> 30:41.480
- What of the replicators?
- These aren't the ones we're used to.

30:41.560 --> 30:47.040
She's controlling them. If Daniel can shut
her down, they might cease to operate.

30:47.600 --> 30:49.600
They exist to protect Reese.

30:49.680 --> 30:52.760
If she's eliminated, they have
no protocol upon which to act.

30:52.840 --> 30:56.520
They may attack Daniel Jackson
to restore their leader's power.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.960
That's where you guys'll come in.

30:59.160 --> 31:01.440
I'm willing to give you a chance,
Dr Jackson.

31:01.760 --> 31:06.280
General, with all due respect,
I think it's a bad idea.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.600
I hope not, Colonel.

31:33.800 --> 31:36.840
Reese, please let me in.
I just want to talk to you.

31:50.880 --> 31:54.280
- Activate the Stargate.
- No.

31:54.360 --> 31:56.360
No, I don't want you to go.

31:58.160 --> 32:00.040
You hate me.

32:00.120 --> 32:02.200
No, I don't. No one does.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.960
They're afraid of me.

32:08.880 --> 32:12.600
- They don't understand you, Reese.
- I never meant to hurt anyone.

32:12.680 --> 32:15.120
I know.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.200
- Please stay.
- It's too late now.

32:17.440 --> 32:22.040
I've accessed your computer system.
I'll figure it out for myself.

32:24.640 --> 32:27.800
Reese, I don't want you to go.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.680
Why not?

32:34.000 --> 32:36.240
I wanna be your friend.

32:41.080 --> 32:44.760
- I've never had a friend.
- I'll be your friend.

32:47.360 --> 32:52.040
Your toys may be a lot of fun,
but... they're not human like us.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.560
They protect me.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.320
I'll protect you.

32:58.640 --> 33:01.360
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.640
No one will hurt you.

33:04.880 --> 33:06.640
Come on.

33:08.640 --> 33:10.840
Show you my world?

33:12.840 --> 33:15.440
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.240
- Argh!
- You're trying to deceive me.

33:24.320 --> 33:26.760
- No!
- Yes. You're lying.

33:26.840 --> 33:29.040
Lying is bad!

33:30.520 --> 33:32.520
None of you will ever hurt me!

33:44.640 --> 33:50.040
Daniel's in trouble. Replicators have left
the gate room. Not sure where they went.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.960
Yeah, roger that. We're going in.

34:05.680 --> 34:11.280
Major, I won't let the replicators escape
this base. We have to set the self-destruct.

34:11.360 --> 34:14.199
The replicators have taken over
the main computer, sir.

34:14.280 --> 34:18.159
We'll have to cut the system access
and set the device locally.

34:39.480 --> 34:41.560
Reese, please listen to me.

34:55.480 --> 34:57.720
No! Make them stop!

34:59.440 --> 35:00.880
On a three count.

35:00.960 --> 35:03.160
Three, two, one!

35:09.720 --> 35:11.320
Clear.

35:23.480 --> 35:26.080
Sir, we're getting ready
to set the self-destruct.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.480
I can't hear you!

35:35.520 --> 35:37.120
On my mark.

35:37.200 --> 35:40.800
Three, two, one, turn!

35:43.000 --> 35:47.480
Sir, we've set the self-destruct. You have
under five minutes to override. Copy?

35:48.200 --> 35:50.200
Roger that!

36:02.640 --> 36:04.080
Thank you.

36:05.880 --> 36:07.680
Sir!

36:08.760 --> 36:12.720
- Make them stop!
- I can't. You can.

36:13.200 --> 36:14.800
No. You'll kill me!

36:14.880 --> 36:18.480
No. We just don't want you to destroy
our world like you destroyed yours.

36:18.560 --> 36:22.520
- I didn't do it!
- You did! You created the replicators.

36:22.600 --> 36:27.320
You told them to replicate. They
destroyed your world, and you let them.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.200
It wasn't my fault.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.160
You could have stopped them
before there were too many.

36:32.240 --> 36:34.920
You could stop them now
before you lose control.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.400
No!

36:36.960 --> 36:38.000
Cease fire!

36:42.480 --> 36:45.720
- What's it doing?
- It's like it doesn't know what to do.

37:04.800 --> 37:07.320
Reese, your father made you wrong!

37:07.400 --> 37:09.600
- No!
- Yes!

37:10.000 --> 37:12.400
You destroyed your world.

37:16.760 --> 37:20.080
- I didn't mean to.
- I know.

37:20.160 --> 37:23.080
But now you're gonna destroy mine, too.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.880
I don't want to.

37:26.160 --> 37:29.520
I know. That's why you have to stop now.

37:31.880 --> 37:35.840
No one will hurt you.
We may be able to fix you.

37:36.640 --> 37:38.040
How?

37:41.000 --> 37:44.280
Just shut off your toys.
Go to sleep. We'll find a way.

37:45.560 --> 37:47.360
I don't believe you.

38:03.280 --> 38:08.000
Colonel, I think Reese is losing control.
A replicator has started to act on its own.

38:16.720 --> 38:19.080
I will wake you up myself. I promise.

38:23.360 --> 38:26.200
I'm your friend. I don't want you to die.

38:28.440 --> 38:31.400
I don't want you to die either.

38:37.280 --> 38:38.520
O'Neill!

39:10.400 --> 39:12.720
(Carter) What's happening in there?

39:13.920 --> 39:16.880
The replicators appear
to have been disabled.

39:41.320 --> 39:42.880
Robot has been neutralised.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.120
(countdown)

39:44.760 --> 39:47.160
Abort the self-destruct.

39:56.680 --> 39:59.040
You stupid son of a bitch.

40:00.560 --> 40:03.280
Hey. You're welcome.

40:05.080 --> 40:08.040
- You didn't have to shoot her.
- Yes, I did.

40:09.520 --> 40:11.560
She was shutting them down.

40:11.920 --> 40:14.840
I had no way of knowing that.
Neither did you.

40:16.800 --> 40:20.560
They didn't stop because you shot her.
They stopped because she told them to.

40:20.760 --> 40:23.480
Carter said she was losing control.

40:23.560 --> 40:28.720
If just one of those damn things got out of
this base, we would be royally screwed!

40:28.800 --> 40:32.280
You just killed the only chance
we'll ever have of stopping them.

40:33.720 --> 40:35.320
Look...

40:37.680 --> 40:39.720
I'm sorry.

40:39.800 --> 40:43.920
But this is the way it had
to go down, and you know it.

40:59.680 --> 41:03.480
All units, this is SG-1 niner.
Commence sweep.

41:03.560 --> 41:06.560
I want every one of
those damn things outta here.
