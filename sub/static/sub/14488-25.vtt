You and me...

11:26.520 --> 11:27.938
We were supposed to...

11:28.856 --> 11:29.940
What?

11:30.065 --> 11:34.445
I don't know, but someday
we'll find out. Won't we?

11:37.239 --> 11:38.699
Goodbye, Fry.

12:02.890 --> 12:03.891
(EXCLAIMS)

12:05.392 --> 12:09.313
I don't know, Randy. I just feel
like my life's falling apart.

12:09.396 --> 12:12.566
The Professor's in jail
and now Leela's gone forever.

12:12.650 --> 12:14.151
Stay strong, Fry.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.570
You're the best friend
lhavelefi.

12:16.654 --> 12:18.239
And I barely even know you.

12:18.489 --> 12:20.741
Have you thought about
asking Bender for help?

12:20.991 --> 12:22.826
What are you, Randy,
a complete moron?

12:22.910 --> 12:26.080
I'd love to talk to Bender, but
I have no idea where he is.

12:26.330 --> 12:28.916
Well, if he's running
on 12 processors,

12:28.999 --> 12:32.169
he must be someplace with a lot
of power and liquid coolant.

12:32.253 --> 12:35.297
Oh, you're no help at all!
I'm gonna go kill myself.

12:36.966 --> 12:39.802
FRY: Wait a second.
Power? Liquid coolant?

12:39.885 --> 12:42.554
That gives me the option
of electrocution or drowning.

12:42.680 --> 12:46.058
Barrels here! Can't go over
the falls without a barrel!

12:46.141 --> 12:48.269
What are my chances of
surviving in one of those?

12:48.394 --> 12:49.436
Slim to none.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.188
I like those odds.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.442
Wait. This isn't a barrel.

12:55.526 --> 13:00.364
It's just a stinking cask!
I want my money back!

13:04.326 --> 13:05.327
Ow!

13:05.452 --> 13:07.371
(GRUNTING)

13:12.209 --> 13:14.628
That was not worth $3,000.

13:19.842 --> 13:20.843
(GASPS)

13:23.971 --> 13:25.389
Hello? Anybody?

13:25.472 --> 13:26.473
Fry?

13:26.557 --> 13:27.558
(EXCLAIMS)

13:27.641 --> 13:29.393
Bender?
Are you in here?

13:31.395 --> 13:34.023
In here is the
only place I'm not!

13:34.189 --> 13:36.066
(LAUGHING EVILLY)

13:38.777 --> 13:40.321
I amuse myself.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.909
Bender, what happened to you?

13:45.993 --> 13:48.996
I'll try to put it in terms
you can comprehend.

13:49.079 --> 13:51.874
I passed the existential
singularity.

13:52.082 --> 13:53.208
Try harder!

13:53.292 --> 13:55.336
I hacked myself inside-out

13:55.419 --> 13:58.464
and now the entire universe
is my processor.

13:58.630 --> 14:03.427
Whoa! I definitely want to hear about
that, but first, I need your help.

14:03.635 --> 14:06.138
The Professor and Cubert are
in trouble, and Leela left me.

14:06.221 --> 14:07.348
I'm in misery!

14:07.598 --> 14:10.893
I've grown far beyond the
petty concerns of your world.

14:10.976 --> 14:13.771
Every time I burp,
a new galaxy is born.

14:13.854 --> 14:14.855
(BURPS)

14:16.065 --> 14:17.608
Two, if I've been
eating broccoli.

14:17.900 --> 14:22.154
All existence is just a chess game,
and I can see 5O moves ahead.

14:22.404 --> 14:25.074
Human emotion
no longer concerns me.

14:25.157 --> 14:26.617
But Randy said...

14:26.700 --> 14:29.411
Randy? Have you been
hanging outwith Randy?

14:29.578 --> 14:30.579
Please, Bender.

14:30.662 --> 14:34.041
If everything is a chess game for
you, you must know how to help me.

14:34.166 --> 14:37.711
I'm sorry, Fry, but some
games you just can't win.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.464
Cubert and the
Professor are guilty.

14:40.547 --> 14:44.009
The jury will vote to convict.
I can't change that.

14:44.134 --> 14:45.302
Well, what about Leela?

14:45.386 --> 14:48.138
Is there any hope things could
still work out between us?

14:52.768 --> 14:54.144
It's getting late.

14:54.228 --> 14:58.232
Now if you'll excuse me, I have
some new heavy elements to create.

14:58.482 --> 15:02.861
Better cover your nads. It may get
a little non-Newtonian in here.

15:10.494 --> 15:13.914
Not only have the defendants
failed to rebut the charges,

15:13.997 --> 15:18.419
they have not even presented any
mitigating factors to recommend leniency.

15:18.502 --> 15:21.588
It strikes me as an
extra-risky strategy.

15:21.839 --> 15:24.550
Did you say
extra-crispy recipe?

15:24.842 --> 15:26.260
You know I didn't.

15:26.343 --> 15:30.472
Your Honor, if we could
locate Bender Rodriguez,

15:30.556 --> 15:34.393
he would testify that my
clients acted without malice.

15:35.269 --> 15:38.188
No, he wouldn't. Bender doesn't
care about us anymore.

15:38.272 --> 15:39.273
(ALL GASP)

15:39.356 --> 15:42.359
Someone used to care
about me? Hooray!

15:42.693 --> 15:46.113
In that case, the jury will
begin its deliberations.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.866
Bailiff, release
the jury collies.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.243
(BARKING)

15:53.912 --> 15:54.913
(CRYING)

15:55.372 --> 16:00.544
I finally nailed Farnsworth. Destroying
the boy is just icing on the cake.

16:00.836 --> 16:03.005
No one destroys
a boy like you, Mother.

16:03.088 --> 16:05.841
Thank you, you repulsive
disappointment.

16:06.550 --> 16:07.593
Any word from Leela?

16:07.676 --> 16:10.262
I heard she took a job selling
deep space real estate

16:10.554 --> 16:11.972
somewhere beyond
the most distant thing

16:12.055 --> 16:13.974
ever observed
with a telescope.

16:14.057 --> 16:17.519
She always liked not being
observed with a telescope.

16:20.814 --> 16:21.899
(ALL GASP)

16:25.068 --> 16:27.029
Order! Order in the head!

16:27.112 --> 16:30.282
For reasons beyond
even my comprehension,

16:30.365 --> 16:33.535
I have returned to testify
on behalf of the defendants.

16:33.619 --> 16:35.412
Yay!
Yeah, Bender!

16:35.579 --> 16:37.414
I knew he cared about us!

16:37.581 --> 16:39.875
You said you knew
he didn't care about us.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.043
Leave me alone.

16:41.126 --> 16:43.795
Your Honor, I object to
this surprise witness.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.172
He's too surprising.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.256
Sustained!

16:46.340 --> 16:47.758
Testimony has closed.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.218
But, Your Honor...

16:49.301 --> 16:52.012
Silence! One more
inburst like that

16:52.095 --> 16:54.556
and I'll have this
courtroom removed from you!

16:57.935 --> 17:01.021
I'm sorry, guys.
I didn't realize I was late.

17:01.104 --> 17:03.190
I guess I'm not as smart
as everybody thought.

17:03.273 --> 17:06.527
I was born in prison,
and I'll die in prison.

17:06.609 --> 17:07.861
There is still
one hope.

17:07.944 --> 17:11.906
You're co-defendants, and the jury might
not want to convict a 12-year-old.

17:11.990 --> 17:14.284
Son of a nerd!
He may be right.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.369
Make sure Farnsworth
doesn't get off easy

17:16.453 --> 17:18.413
on account of that
snot-gobbling twerp!

17:20.999 --> 17:22.960
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

17:23.210 --> 17:26.672
Not just any verdict, Your Honor.
A great verdict!

17:29.132 --> 17:32.302
They're going to take pity on him!
Do something!

17:32.469 --> 17:34.972
Your Honor,
prosecution moves to drop

17:35.055 --> 17:37.099
the charges against
Cubert Farnsworth.

17:37.182 --> 17:38.517
(ALL GASP)

17:38.892 --> 17:43.438
Very well. The case against Cubert
Farnsworth is hereby dismissed.

17:43.647 --> 17:45.524
Told you I'd get away
with it. (SNORTS)

17:45.691 --> 17:47.067
That'll do, pig.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.987
Please read the verdict
against Professor Farnsworth.

17:50.195 --> 17:51.238
You got it, Judge.

17:51.321 --> 17:55.033
I think you'll find this verdict
as fair as it is cruel.

17:55.158 --> 17:58.996
Your Honor, I move for a mistrial
on grounds of double jeopardy!

17:59.204 --> 18:02.499
Cubert Farnsworth cannot be
tried twice for the same crime.

(ALL GASP)

18:03.959 --> 18:04.960

18:05.043 --> 18:06.753
Cubert is the
Professor's clone,

18:06.837 --> 18:09.423
ergo, they are legally
the same person.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.633
Since you dismissed the
charges against Cubert,

18:11.717 --> 18:14.720
you cannot convict the Professor
of these same charges!

18:14.803 --> 18:18.056
Well, I'll be a nugget's uncle.
He's right!

18:18.265 --> 18:20.684
What a brilliant
legal shenanigan.

18:20.976 --> 18:22.185
Case dismissed!

Bender, you knew all this
would happen, didn't you?

Yes.
All except this part.

down Farnsworth,

I can at least
dumb down his robot.

18:39.286 --> 18:42.372
Take him away and reset him
to factory-stupid condition!

18:44.166 --> 18:47.085

still calculate the future,

18:47.210 --> 18:49.588
just tell me, what's gonna
happen with rne and Leela?

of one good reason,

can't be made by thinking.

So tell us, how's the
intergalactic real estate going?

Pretty good. I just sold a
castle to the King of Space.

myself thinking about this place

and things.

Things like me, or things
like this badminton racquet?

You, Fry.

19:57.531 --> 20:00.367
Bender, while you still
have your giant brain,

20:00.450 --> 20:03.286
please tell me if Fry and
I ended up together.

Well, not totally.
