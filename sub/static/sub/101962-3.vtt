WEBVTT

00:00.280 --> 00:02.640
-They reckon you're a witch.
-But you're not afraid.

00:02.800 --> 00:06.200
You are a weaver,
a maker of spells.

00:06.360 --> 00:10.040
A word of caution: no one in London
should be trusted with knowledge of you.

00:10.200 --> 00:15.840
Are the witches turning against
Her Majesty, Master Caldwell?

00:16.000 --> 00:17.560
No. They're loyal.

00:17.720 --> 00:21.640
<i>Andrew Hubbard is a vampire</i>
<i>who rules over the city of London.</i>

00:21.800 --> 00:24.640
Tom Caldwell has been caught
in Cecil's web.

00:24.800 --> 00:27.920
Any influence I may have won't be
spent protecting your interests.

00:28.080 --> 00:31.280
Or should I ask Philippe de Clermont
for assistance?

00:31.440 --> 00:32.960
<i>You killed a man of mercy.</i>

00:33.120 --> 00:36.640
If I was truly merciful, he would be
rowing himself down the Thames.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.120
He was innocent.

00:38.280 --> 00:41.840
There was no path where Tom survived
and I could keep you safe.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.160
Put this into the hand
of Philippe de Clermont.

00:44.320 --> 00:47.280
Perhaps you had reason
to support the witches.

00:47.440 --> 00:50.320
My loyalty and devotion
to the Queen are steadfast.

00:50.480 --> 00:54.320
<i>I advise you to remember</i>
<i>the punishment for traitors,</i>

00:54.480 --> 00:57.280
<i>human or creature.</i>

01:11.520 --> 01:14.200
They'll be here
to pick him up any minute.

01:29.600 --> 01:33.200
You were right to call me.
You'll send me the postmortem?

01:33.360 --> 01:35.280
-Sure.
-Make sure you do.

02:41.160 --> 02:44.000
Our Father,

02:44.160 --> 02:46.280
who art in heaven,

02:46.440 --> 02:48.000
hallowed be Thy name,

02:48.160 --> 02:50.600
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

02:50.760 --> 02:53.360
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

02:56.640 --> 03:00.320
Tom was an innocent
child of God.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.840
Master Caldwell's death
was not my intention.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.360
I laid him to rest
with my own hands.

03:05.520 --> 03:09.480
No human strength could have
snapped his neck so cleanly.

03:09.640 --> 03:14.200
Cecil had determined his guilt.
I wished

03:14.360 --> 03:18.120
to spare him
from any further pain.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.400
I have asked
for God's forgiveness.

03:31.400 --> 03:34.080
I am here...

03:40.480 --> 03:43.200
I am here to ask for yours.

03:52.040 --> 03:56.560
Matthew de Clairmont
has come to beg.

04:03.640 --> 04:07.720
His death truly weighs on you.

04:08.600 --> 04:12.520
-Your witch has changed you.
-She has nothing to do with this.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.040
I doubt that very much.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.600
If you let this matter rest,

04:18.760 --> 04:23.200
I will inform my father
of your magnanimity.

04:23.360 --> 04:28.560
Philippe's gratitude
is a rare currency.

04:28.720 --> 04:32.040
I will consider

04:32.200 --> 04:34.360
your plea.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.240
Don't you like eels?

04:44.400 --> 04:46.280
I like watching you eat them.

04:48.320 --> 04:52.240
I'm sorry I'm not helping
his table manners.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.360
From the Countess of Pembroke.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.640
Thank you.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.720
Conducting experiments
is much more thrilling

05:09.880 --> 05:12.240
than reading about them.

05:12.400 --> 05:16.120
Henry tells me you are searching
for an old chemical book.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.920
Yes.
It's proving illusive.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.240
Now add the aqua fortis.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.240
Perhaps the Queen's astrologer
can assist.

05:25.400 --> 05:29.240
His library is remarkable.
I've read many a book.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.480
Thought John Dee had gone
to the continent.

05:31.640 --> 05:35.160
He has returned
and is looking for patronage.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.000
Mention my name.

05:37.160 --> 05:40.520
-Dr. Dee can be amenable.
-It seems so.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.200
-Master Roydon.
-Dr. Dee, may I present my wife, Diana.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.400
She's a friend
of the Countess of Pembroke

05:51.560 --> 05:53.240
and shares her love of alchemy.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.840
Well, any friend of the Countess
is most welcome.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.080
Thank you.

06:04.240 --> 06:08.080
I've heard so much about
your great collection, Dr. Dee.

06:14.520 --> 06:19.040
My, new scryer,
Robert Ainslie.

06:19.200 --> 06:23.600
Forgive our disorder,
we are overwhelmed with work.

06:23.760 --> 06:27.080
My previous scryer abandoned me

06:27.240 --> 06:29.600
in Bohemia.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.680
Edward Kelly.

06:32.840 --> 06:37.200
Yes, a man of great talent,
but unsteady temperament.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.280
Mmm.

06:50.440 --> 06:53.600
Sigillum Dei.

06:53.760 --> 06:58.720
The designs dictated
by the angels, Mistress Roydon,

06:58.880 --> 07:02.000
to aid me conversations
with them.

07:03.920 --> 07:07.840
I'm going to have a hell of a time
getting you out of here.

07:10.560 --> 07:14.080
Dr. Dee, might I browse
your collection?

07:15.880 --> 07:19.360
Well, as you wish.

07:19.520 --> 07:20.920
It's my understanding, Doctor,

07:21.080 --> 07:23.080
that you had a recent visit
from the Queen

07:23.240 --> 07:25.040
bestowed upon you.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.960
Was she in excellent humor?

07:35.880 --> 07:38.880
You seek a specific text?

07:39.040 --> 07:40.760
An old book of alchemy

07:40.920 --> 07:44.080
written in an unknown language.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.680
What do you of its provenance?

07:49.040 --> 07:50.640
Very little.

07:50.800 --> 07:54.480
May have belonged
to the magician Roger Bacon.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.240
Dr. Dee does have such a book.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.160
Acquired from Emperor Rudolf.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.720
May I see it?

08:06.880 --> 08:09.120
You can decipher the text?

08:09.280 --> 08:12.760
No. No. My interest is...

08:13.840 --> 08:15.640
...scholarly.

08:24.240 --> 08:28.560
Unfortunately,
this is not the book you seek.

08:28.720 --> 08:34.280
I discovered it in my boxes
on return from Bohemia.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.800
But a treasured book
was missing.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.560
I believe Edward replaced it.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.960
Tell me about the missing book.

08:44.120 --> 08:47.560
It was a rare text,
larger than this one.

08:47.720 --> 08:50.040
It contained many mysteries

08:50.200 --> 08:55.920
which Edward could understand
with divine assistance.

08:59.560 --> 09:02.000
Sir Kelly's remained in Bohemia?

09:02.160 --> 09:06.680
Rudolf took great interest
in both him and this book.

09:06.840 --> 09:10.960
Edward said it contained
a secret method

09:11.120 --> 09:14.320
for obtaining immortality.

09:14.480 --> 09:18.240
Well, perhaps I could help.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.720
If you'll permit me to take this,

09:20.880 --> 09:24.240
I can try to put it back
to where it belongs.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.720
and return your book to you.

09:27.880 --> 09:32.400
I would be forever in your debt.

09:32.560 --> 09:35.520
I'll have my assistant
wrap it for you, sir.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.480
Well done.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.880
It must be Ashmole 782.

09:48.040 --> 09:51.000
-Yes.
-But how do we get it?

09:52.760 --> 09:55.320
Your guess is as good as mine.

10:10.920 --> 10:14.920
Shh, shh, shh.
Jack, Jack, Jack, I'm here.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.840
It's all right.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.640
What was it this time?
Can you tell me?

10:18.800 --> 10:21.760
-Same as always.
-Ah, the tall man.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.160
But what if it comes back?

10:24.320 --> 10:28.040
Well, then
I will chase him away.

10:30.960 --> 10:36.720
You're a part of our family now.
You are safe from monsters here.

10:37.840 --> 10:42.160
Hmm.
I'll just be upstairs.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.080
Being here...

10:55.840 --> 10:58.400
Oh.

10:59.320 --> 11:04.120
-Come to bed.
-I know I had contact in Bohemia.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.960
Couldn't we get
the book ourselves?

11:08.640 --> 11:11.520
There are witch trials
spreading all across Europe.

11:11.680 --> 11:14.040
Emperor Rudolf
is dangerously unpredictable.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.920
The book
might as well be on Mars.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.200
Is Jack okay?

11:22.280 --> 11:23.840
I believe so.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.200
I dread to think what that
poor boy has been through.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.640
You are so good with him.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.360
I'm woefully out of practice.

11:33.520 --> 11:37.120
We've hardly had a chance
to adapt to being parents.

11:37.280 --> 11:42.000
I've been doing what I must
to keep us safe.

11:43.720 --> 11:45.760
Go to bed.

11:45.920 --> 11:49.160
You need to be
well rested for tomorrow.

11:49.320 --> 11:52.520
I will be here when you wake.

12:14.080 --> 12:17.240
She will be safe with us,
Master Roydon.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.760
Word will be sent
when she is finished.

12:24.880 --> 12:27.040
I'll be okay.

12:33.760 --> 12:37.360
<i>I have asked</i>
<i>my gathering to join us.</i>

12:37.520 --> 12:40.080
<i>Their magical skill</i>
<i>will help you train.</i>

12:42.240 --> 12:44.720
It's time to begin.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.280
Regard the room
with your witch's sight

12:56.440 --> 12:58.480
and tell me what you see.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.480
Threads of light.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.240
That is the warp and weft

13:15.400 --> 13:18.920
of all life in the cosmos
made visible.

13:22.280 --> 13:26.320
A weaver selects...

13:28.440 --> 13:30.600
and shapes something new.

13:30.760 --> 13:36.640
That is how a weaver
creates new spells.

13:37.440 --> 13:40.400
Each element
has its own threads.

13:40.560 --> 13:44.560
So, we must discover
your element.

13:44.720 --> 13:47.680
I bring air.

13:47.840 --> 13:50.720
Marjorie, earth.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.880
Lizzie, water.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.800
And Catherine, fire.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.360
Within the witches' circle,

14:02.520 --> 14:06.320
we share with you
our element of power.

14:06.480 --> 14:07.960
All you have to do

14:08.120 --> 14:14.200
is choose the thread that
calls out to you the strongest.

14:14.360 --> 14:17.960
The whole world
is in your grasp, Diana.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.840
Enough.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.760
Enough.

14:51.920 --> 14:54.560
Did... Did I do
something wrong?

14:56.040 --> 14:58.320
I wonder.

15:06.960 --> 15:10.640
Ah, wipe your feet on that
if you so wish.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.800
Tell me, Kit,

15:20.160 --> 15:23.160
what do you know about Bohemia?

15:23.320 --> 15:26.440
Well, only that it's ruled
by a madman.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.000
Is that what's been
occupying you?

15:29.160 --> 15:30.480
The book is lost.

15:30.640 --> 15:35.160
If I were you, I'd focus your attention
on matters closer to home.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.320
Do you mean Cecil?

15:39.320 --> 15:41.320
Does he know about Diana?

15:41.480 --> 15:46.600
The fact that you are married,
or that she is a witch?

15:46.760 --> 15:49.000
Lord Burghley likes
to hide his true feelings

15:49.160 --> 15:50.840
beneath a cloak of deception,

15:51.000 --> 15:54.800
but he knows that
you are not yourself.

16:01.520 --> 16:03.520
Enough.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.960
I think they are
sufficiently pulverized.

16:08.720 --> 16:13.320
Casting your first spell
is difficult for any weaver.

16:13.480 --> 16:17.480
You must be kinder
to yourself, Diana.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.880
The others probably don't even
believe I am a weaver.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.400
They've never met
your like before.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.920
Nor have I.

16:25.080 --> 16:29.480
Most witches have one element
in their blood,

16:29.640 --> 16:33.440
and they only see the threads
of those elements.

16:33.600 --> 16:37.200
So it's easy for them
to choose between them.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.560
But you saw them all.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.720
Why?

16:43.880 --> 16:46.240
I think you know.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.440
Wind.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.040
<i>Water.</i>

16:58.000 --> 16:59.720
<i>Earth.</i>

17:01.600 --> 17:02.920
And fire.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.680
All within you.

17:05.840 --> 17:08.360
No wonder you're such trouble.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.920
You sound like my aunt Sarah.

17:13.080 --> 17:15.960
Tell me about her.

17:19.480 --> 17:23.280
<i>I miss her, and my aunt Em.</i>

17:23.440 --> 17:26.400
<i>I wish they could know</i>
<i>I was safe.</i>

17:49.280 --> 17:52.360
This space is safe and sacred.

18:01.720 --> 18:07.760
This path is closed to evil.

18:29.800 --> 18:33.000
<i>Rebecca, are you there?</i>

18:33.160 --> 18:35.680
<i>Diana needs us.</i>

18:38.920 --> 18:42.040
We have
an unexpected guest, sir.

18:55.280 --> 18:58.440
It's an honor to meet
the Queen's Lord Treasurer.

19:02.880 --> 19:07.080
I'm surprised you're so well
acquainted with my station.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.560
It's clear to me
you are a stranger here,

19:09.720 --> 19:11.600
Mistress Roydon.

19:11.760 --> 19:15.680
Quite simply, Diana
is not from London.

19:15.840 --> 19:19.040
Your newfound sympathies
towards her kind

19:19.200 --> 19:22.560
explain much
of your recent behavior.

19:25.280 --> 19:29.040
My kind are loyal
to the crown, Lord Burghley,

19:29.200 --> 19:32.240
and only wish to live in peace.

19:32.400 --> 19:36.560
Then why keep this marriage
secret from Her Majesty?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.560
We merely wished for Diana
to be settled in town

19:40.720 --> 19:43.920
before presenting her
at court.

19:44.920 --> 19:47.200
Her Majesty questions the trust

19:47.360 --> 19:50.280
she had long placed in you,
Master Roydon.

19:52.080 --> 19:55.640
She expects you both
at Whitehall tomorrow.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.680
I never thought I'd be so desperate
not to meet Queen Elizabeth.

20:24.840 --> 20:27.960
Queen Elizabeth
trusts me implicitly.

20:28.120 --> 20:32.160
William Cecil
cannot change that...

20:33.840 --> 20:36.280
...overnight.

20:45.400 --> 20:49.320
There really is no one
that you won't betray for money.

20:49.480 --> 20:52.200
I should have known.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.920
You've been nothing
but poison since we arrived.

20:55.080 --> 20:58.160
I have done all that I can do
to help you.

20:58.320 --> 21:02.200
No, you are hellbent
on driving Diana and I apart.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.960
You told Cecil!

21:06.680 --> 21:09.480
You could have gotten her killed.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.080
Lies come sweetly
to you, don't they?

21:13.240 --> 21:16.200
What, did you think that if she
was gone, everything would be as it was?

21:16.360 --> 21:20.240
I swear Cecil did not hear of Diana
from me.

21:20.400 --> 21:24.800
I am nothing without Diana!
And if you can't accept that...

21:24.960 --> 21:28.120
then you are
no friend of mine.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.320
Stay away from her.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.160
You stay away from us both.

21:46.440 --> 21:48.480
Get out of my way!

21:48.640 --> 21:50.920
His Lordship
is not receiving visitors.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.560
Who told you about
Roydon's witch?

21:55.760 --> 21:58.960
Nothing in London happens
without my eyes on it.

21:59.120 --> 22:00.440
You have to tell him
it wasn't me.

22:00.600 --> 22:04.160
But it should have been you.
That's what I pay you for.

22:04.320 --> 22:05.840
I never would have betrayed him.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.680
Yes, you would.
If it suited you.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.800
I have no interest
in your squabbles.

22:27.960 --> 22:30.120
My lady.

22:43.720 --> 22:45.880
I hear you are
expected at court.

22:46.040 --> 22:50.440
I am here to make sure your armor
is worthy of the battle to come.

22:54.520 --> 22:57.480
My wardrobe offers
ample protection.

22:57.640 --> 22:59.880
This dress is a year old.

23:00.040 --> 23:02.920
Her Majesty will
approve of your frugality

23:03.080 --> 23:07.920
and disregard for
the whims of fashion.

23:08.080 --> 23:11.080
-That much is true.
-Hmm.

23:13.200 --> 23:15.160
The Queen will make us wait.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.880
I've often thought about
what I'd ask her if I ever met her.

23:23.040 --> 23:26.000
Nothing.
She will ask the questions.

23:26.160 --> 23:28.720
Keep the answers short.

23:29.960 --> 23:32.200
She's just a person, Diana.

23:32.360 --> 23:37.760
Let her, give her what she wants
and you'll have nothing to fear.

24:00.720 --> 24:05.720
You look tired, Shadow.
Marriage does not suit you.

24:05.880 --> 24:09.040
My humblest apologies for not presenting
my wife at court sooner.

24:09.200 --> 24:10.520
She is a newcomer to London

24:10.680 --> 24:14.480
and required time to
become acquainted with the city.

24:14.640 --> 24:19.960
Nonsense.
You thought I would not find out.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.840
I would not be so naive.

24:25.000 --> 24:30.200
Your Majesty's omniscience
is the stuff of legend.

24:31.760 --> 24:36.200
I would like to speak to Master Roydon
and his wife alone.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.640
Your Majesty...

24:45.040 --> 24:47.960
Who are you,
Mistress Roydon?

24:48.120 --> 24:51.200
To make a traitor
out of my shadow.

24:53.360 --> 24:56.920
Matthew is no traitor,
Your Majesty.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.840
He's as loyal to you
as he ever was.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.600
Cannot be loyal to both of us.

25:01.760 --> 25:05.760
Men have enough trouble
obeying one woman. Let alone two.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.760
I pledge myself
your humble servant

25:08.920 --> 25:12.200
and compel my husband to
adhere only to your will.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.520
She's clever.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.280
Too clever.

25:18.440 --> 25:20.240
Like all her kind.

25:20.400 --> 25:23.200
Her kind
have always served you well.

25:23.360 --> 25:26.000
-They turned against me.
-There is no evidence for that.

25:26.160 --> 25:30.080
Well, perhaps there would have been
had you not dispatched him.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.920
What does your witch want
with my astrologer?

25:38.080 --> 25:40.120
We are interested in a book

25:40.280 --> 25:43.200
in the possession of
John Dee's associate,

25:43.360 --> 25:45.600
Edward Kelley.

25:45.760 --> 25:49.000
And as this book concern
the Philosopher's Stone?

25:49.160 --> 25:52.120
No. It is of interest
only to us creatures.

25:52.280 --> 25:55.280
Yet Kelley
has learned to create the Stone

25:55.440 --> 25:58.520
where thousands
before him have failed.

25:58.680 --> 26:02.920
That is what he may
wish you to believe.

26:03.080 --> 26:05.240
The Emperor Rudolf
believes it, too.

26:05.400 --> 26:07.400
And I will not let
the key to eternal life

26:07.560 --> 26:12.280
and limitless riches
fall into a Hapsburg hands.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.960
You wish to live forever.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.440
If I must.

26:21.600 --> 26:25.240
Every day I pray
for God's help.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.200
In saving England
from disaster.

26:27.360 --> 26:30.080
Edward Kelley
is not God's answer.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.600
I promise you that.

26:31.760 --> 26:35.400
I will be the judge
of God's intentions.

26:36.760 --> 26:40.840
I am... but your servant.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.800
And His.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.840
I would be glad
to prove my loyalty

26:47.000 --> 26:51.360
by assisting you in your search
for the Philosopher's Stone.

26:51.520 --> 26:55.800
I've sent ambassadors to Bohemia
to retrieve Kelley.

26:56.920 --> 26:59.520
The Emperor rebuffed them.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.520
Perhaps he will be
more receptive to me.

27:06.680 --> 27:09.960
You can be very persuasive.

27:10.120 --> 27:13.360
Very well, Your Majesty.
I will bring you Kelley.

27:13.520 --> 27:15.040
And you can lock him
in The Tower

27:15.200 --> 27:18.080
until he creates
the Philosopher's Stone.

27:19.120 --> 27:22.680
Then I may forgive
your recent mistakes.

27:41.360 --> 27:45.040
Will Kelley return
with you willingly?

27:45.200 --> 27:47.720
I shall find out.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.120
When do we leave?

27:53.680 --> 27:56.760
The journey will take months,
and it will be very, very hard.

27:56.920 --> 28:00.200
And you've only just
started your training, Diana.

28:00.360 --> 28:03.320
Matthew, I'm not staying
here on my own.

28:03.480 --> 28:05.600
I'm the only one
connected to the book.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.160
You need me.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.640
I know.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.320
But you should be
focusing on your magic

28:13.480 --> 28:15.800
so that we can get home.

28:18.720 --> 28:24.160
Today we will give you
one thread at a time.

28:32.360 --> 28:35.760
Just let the power
move through you.

29:03.920 --> 29:07.640
With knot of one,
the spell's begun.

29:24.600 --> 29:27.880
With knot of two,
the spell is true.

30:06.200 --> 30:09.720
With knot of three,
the spell is free.

30:33.080 --> 30:36.240
-It was a tree.
-Not just a tree. A rowan tree.

30:36.400 --> 30:40.680
-A crossing between worlds.
-A union of opposites.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.680
You are truly a weaver.

30:45.400 --> 30:47.400
I didn't get to finish.

30:47.560 --> 30:51.440
In time, you will complete
your forespell

30:51.600 --> 30:54.840
and your familiar
will be revealed.

30:57.040 --> 31:00.080
I've been waiting for so long. I...
I want to learn it all now.

31:00.240 --> 31:04.000
You must learn patience. Diana.

31:06.080 --> 31:08.680
Yes.

31:08.840 --> 31:10.800
Yes.

31:18.440 --> 31:21.000
Diana.

31:21.160 --> 31:25.480
You are a powerful witch.
Of that there is no doubt.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.840
Then why can't I control it?

31:29.000 --> 31:34.040
Magic feeds from
all aspects of your life.

31:36.040 --> 31:39.600
Everything is intertwined.

31:52.240 --> 31:54.440
I didn't
get past the third knot.

31:54.600 --> 31:58.080
Well, sounds like
progress to me.

31:59.440 --> 32:02.360
Yes. Maybe.

32:02.520 --> 32:04.440
I still think that...

32:46.880 --> 32:49.360
One day I'll beat you to it.

32:49.520 --> 32:51.360
But not today.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.160
Gallowglass.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.600
-Ah! Uncle!
-Ah!

32:59.760 --> 33:03.720
All right, all right.
Put me down.

33:03.880 --> 33:06.400
-How are you?
-I'm well. How are you?

33:06.560 --> 33:07.920
All the better for seeing you.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.720
Eh, and where the hell
have you been?

33:09.880 --> 33:11.560
Come in. Come in.

33:11.720 --> 33:15.360
The inn-keeper in Chester said
you left without paying your bill.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.800
This is Diana.

33:20.960 --> 33:23.960
And this is my nephew,
Gallowglass.

33:24.120 --> 33:27.040
-Nice to meet you, Gallowglass.
-A witch.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.920
Taking her ease in your parlor.

33:30.080 --> 33:32.600
I have a great deal
to tell you.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.880
That's an understatement.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.600
First...

33:38.760 --> 33:41.640
I must discharge my duties.

33:41.800 --> 33:44.520
A courier handed this to me.

33:44.680 --> 33:47.360
It's from your father in France.

34:05.920 --> 34:09.360
My father commands me
to return to Sept-Tours.

34:09.520 --> 34:11.200
With you.

34:15.840 --> 34:18.840
Philippe and I
do not see eye-to-eye, but...

34:19.000 --> 34:20.640
I'd say there's some
explaining to do.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.480
How did he find out
about us?

34:22.640 --> 34:24.360
He has eyes everywhere.

34:24.520 --> 34:27.080
And if you're not on French soil
within the week,

34:27.240 --> 34:29.720
he will make for
England himself.

34:31.120 --> 34:35.720
Sounds like we have no choice.
We have to go.

34:35.880 --> 34:38.520
She speaks sense,
at least.

34:51.240 --> 34:54.720
Philippe always puts
a coin in the wax.

34:56.920 --> 35:01.440
He expects me to put it into
his palm when I arrive. It's...

35:02.360 --> 35:04.760
It's his thing.

35:05.640 --> 35:07.440
His test of loyalty.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.720
It's been a long time since
I've seen his handwriting.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.200
Last time I saw him,

35:13.360 --> 35:15.960
he was so broken by
what the Nazis had done.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.600
He couldn't even hold a pen.

35:22.520 --> 35:25.000
And he loved to write.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.080
I know seeing him again
will reopen old words,

35:33.240 --> 35:37.120
but maybe it will heal them, too.

35:37.280 --> 35:40.640
Not before making them worse,
I assure you.

35:42.280 --> 35:44.880
We'll face it together.

35:45.040 --> 35:47.520
I'll be dragging you
through a war.

35:49.040 --> 35:52.000
If I remember correctly,
the war has quieted

35:52.160 --> 35:57.120
now that the King has retreated
from the Siege of Paris.

36:00.240 --> 36:02.320
I can handle the journey.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.640
You know, it's funny.

36:08.080 --> 36:11.840
Philippe always said that
mating was destiny

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
and that when I found her...

36:15.160 --> 36:17.800
You...

36:17.960 --> 36:19.560
I would just have to
accept my fate.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.840
But that's not how it works.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.280
In every moment,
for the rest of my life,

36:26.440 --> 36:28.920
I will be choosing you.

36:30.560 --> 36:32.560
Over everything else.

36:45.920 --> 36:48.640
You should be
completing your training,

36:48.800 --> 36:51.720
not embarking on
a long voyage.

36:51.880 --> 36:56.840
Goody, my magic is connected
to my intuition and emotions.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.480
And they are
connected to Matthew.

37:00.640 --> 37:04.840
Every fiber in my being is
telling me that I have to go.

37:07.560 --> 37:12.760
Very well.
Then go you must.

37:12.920 --> 37:16.120
But these knots
will not learn themselves.

37:16.280 --> 37:19.440
I will continue to study.
I promise.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.920
And then I'll be back.

37:23.080 --> 37:27.120
Know you are setting
a new course, Diana.

37:27.280 --> 37:31.960
And I cannot foresee
where it might lead.

37:44.960 --> 37:48.000
Walter's ships traveled here.

37:48.160 --> 37:51.400
-Far away?
-Far, far away.

37:51.560 --> 37:55.240
And this is where I'm from,
and that's where we're going.

37:55.400 --> 38:00.000
Then on to... Bohemia.

38:00.160 --> 38:02.760
How many days
will the journey take?

38:02.920 --> 38:06.360
-Many.
-Then we'll need good horses.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.520
Jack...

38:08.680 --> 38:13.080
I know what you're gonna say.
I don't care if it's dangerous.

38:13.240 --> 38:15.960
You're the bravest boy I know, but...

38:17.640 --> 38:21.800
I would never forgive
myself if you got hurt.

38:23.040 --> 38:25.040
Neither would I.

38:34.160 --> 38:38.640
We need you to stay here,
to keep an eye on Francoise.

38:41.680 --> 38:45.480
I have something for you.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.440
It's very special.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.720
Go on. Open it.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.320
They just arrived.

39:01.960 --> 39:04.360
We had them painted for you.

39:04.520 --> 39:06.880
You look after them
until we get back.

39:08.160 --> 39:10.000
All right?

39:11.720 --> 39:13.480
Good boy.

39:20.360 --> 39:21.840
The boats are ready.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.200
I will escort you to the beach
in Mont Saint-Michel, but no further.

39:25.360 --> 39:27.480
You... you won't travel with us?

39:27.640 --> 39:30.920
My father died at
the hands of the French.

39:31.080 --> 39:32.760
I'm so sorry.

39:34.840 --> 39:38.120
Until I make peace with the past,
I will not venture into France.

39:38.280 --> 39:42.840
-Of course.
-Diana, forgive my earlier reticence.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.560
It's obvious to me now that
Matthew has pledged himself to you.

39:46.720 --> 39:49.040
Matthew will need you
at Sept-Tours.

39:49.200 --> 39:54.080
You must be his anchor.
Otherwise he may lose himself.

40:18.480 --> 40:22.640
Maybe seeing your father
was meant to happen.

40:22.800 --> 40:26.000
Maybe it's one of
the reasons we're here.

40:27.720 --> 40:29.600
Hmm.

40:50.600 --> 40:53.120
I don't know whether
to admire your nerve

40:53.280 --> 40:57.320
or pity or stupidity, coming here
after you betrayed me.

40:57.480 --> 41:00.080
I've waited a long time
to be free from

41:00.240 --> 41:03.600
Philippe de Clairmont's hold
on our species.

41:03.760 --> 41:05.480
So, unless you are
here to present me

41:05.640 --> 41:09.600
with his son's head,
I suggest you fuck off.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.600
Oh, it's much better than that.

41:11.760 --> 41:13.640
This could bring the
whole de Clairmont Dynasty

41:13.800 --> 41:15.800
crashing to its knees.

41:17.360 --> 41:20.600
-It's a body.
-Anyone we know?

41:20.760 --> 41:22.720
No, it doesn't matter.
It's how they died.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.760
It looked like
an uncontrolled feeding.

41:24.920 --> 41:28.960
Multiple bite marks.
The body was torn apart.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.920
I haven't seen anything
like that in centuries.

41:31.080 --> 41:32.680
And we do all know the rumors

41:32.840 --> 41:35.320
about the de Clairmont's
infected bloodline.

41:35.480 --> 41:39.280
You need to have more than
suspicions, you need to be sure.

41:39.440 --> 41:41.920
I'm working on that.

41:44.560 --> 41:47.280
And if you find
something concrete...

41:47.440 --> 41:51.760
Wasn't I clear?
This is a negotiation.

41:51.920 --> 41:57.480
Then I need...
a starting price.

42:01.640 --> 42:03.280
Venice.

42:06.640 --> 42:08.800
This was my city, and you
took it away from me.

42:08.960 --> 42:11.240
You were interfering
in human politics.

42:11.400 --> 42:13.920
This city was the center
of civilization when I ran it,

42:14.080 --> 42:16.120
and now look at it.

42:16.280 --> 42:20.520
Overrun by tourists
and cheap souvenir shops.

42:24.240 --> 42:28.200
And you think you can save it.

42:28.360 --> 42:30.320
Without a doubt.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.880
And in return?

42:39.480 --> 42:43.640
I'll give you the means to
destroy the de Clairmonts.

42:53.640 --> 42:54.960
Becca?

42:55.120 --> 42:57.080
Phoebe Taylor.

42:57.240 --> 43:00.000
Marcus Whitmore.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.680
Cold hands. Sorry.

43:02.840 --> 43:05.880
I may have
looked you up online,

43:06.040 --> 43:08.240
and you're invisible.

43:08.400 --> 43:12.720
<i>Who in this day and age</i>
<i>has zero social media presence?</i>

43:14.080 --> 43:16.880
<i>A vampire is</i>
<i>murdering warm bloods.</i>

43:17.040 --> 43:19.160
Whoever's doing this
is infected with blood rage.

43:19.320 --> 43:22.720
My grandfather eliminated
blood rage centuries ago.

43:22.880 --> 43:25.600
I was worried that
your love for Matthew

43:25.760 --> 43:28.200
might have blinded you.

43:28.360 --> 43:30.680
What would you know of love?

43:30.840 --> 43:35.400
I know he and his witch
are hiding somewhere in time,

43:35.560 --> 43:37.960
but what are they planning?

43:38.120 --> 43:43.000
You traveled 800 miles
from Venice to ask me that?

43:43.160 --> 43:45.320
Next time, send an email.
