Episode Title : <font color=#FFFF00>"Go Big or Go Homer"</font>

00:08.859 --> 00:11.648
Oh, boy, Lenny is gonna be
so surprised.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.326
And I got the perfect card.

00:13.413 --> 00:14.607
CARL:
Uh‐huh!

00:14.695 --> 00:16.812
"Over the hill than under it."
Yeah.

00:18.781 --> 00:22.187
Having chipped in,
you may now sign.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.796
Nice work.

00:23.930 --> 00:26.279
No "best wishes,"
I like the restraint.

00:26.366 --> 00:29.710
Yeah, I thought about "regards,"
but Lenny knows how I feel.

00:30.036 --> 00:32.523
<i>(pens squeaking)</i>

00:32.686 --> 00:34.804
Okay, everybody, be quiet.

00:34.918 --> 00:37.967
Lenny's gonna be here
any minute. Shh.

00:38.211 --> 00:39.578
(chuckles excitedly)

00:40.608 --> 00:43.023
ALL:
Sur... prise.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.140
(all groaning) ‐

00:44.228 --> 00:46.332
I thought
this was my blood transfusion room,

00:46.419 --> 00:48.468
but, uh,
there's not a baby in sight.

00:48.555 --> 00:51.004
It's a surprise party
for Lenny, sir.

00:51.091 --> 00:54.207
Everybody chipped in five bucks
for a card and a cake

00:54.294 --> 00:58.044
and a show by close‐up magician
Abraca‐Debra.

00:58.131 --> 01:01.181
‐(all gasping)
‐What? Damn!

01:01.268 --> 01:04.117
Well, in that case,
I suppose I should sign, too.

01:05.702 --> 01:09.685
"With regards,
C. Montgomery Burns."

01:09.976 --> 01:11.458
Mm. Hmm.

01:11.562 --> 01:13.193
(humming)

01:13.280 --> 01:15.729
Ah, Lenny, happy birthday.

01:15.870 --> 01:17.471

01:19.072 --> 01:20.874

01:30.130 --> 01:32.011
This is the greatest
birthday ever!

01:32.098 --> 01:34.748
And best of all,
Mr. Burns signed my card.

01:34.835 --> 01:36.616
To everyone who chipped in.

01:36.703 --> 01:39.062
<i>(echoing):
Chipped in. Chipped in.</i>

01:39.339 --> 01:41.453
<i>(distorting):
Chipped in.</i>

01:43.304 --> 01:46.044
What kind of person
signs a birthday card

01:46.132 --> 01:47.360
and doesn't chip in?

01:47.447 --> 01:49.395
You sign the card,
you got to chip in.

01:49.482 --> 01:52.812
‐It's the code of the card.
‐How big did he sign?

01:52.900 --> 01:54.800
Eddie Bauer big.

01:54.888 --> 01:56.507
(gasps)

01:56.595 --> 01:59.472
Stupid unpaid signature.

01:59.559 --> 02:01.074
This is the worst thing
that ever happened

02:01.161 --> 02:02.726
at a nuclear power plant.

02:02.814 --> 02:04.898
Homie, just let it go.

02:04.986 --> 02:07.569
Don't let a signature
drive you crazy.

02:07.701 --> 02:08.835
You're right, honey.

02:08.923 --> 02:10.304
I'll let it go.

02:10.390 --> 02:12.648
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

02:13.027 --> 02:15.289

02:15.459 --> 02:17.744
<i>BURNS:

02:17.832 --> 02:19.109
No. No!

N-o-o-o-o!

02:21.368 --> 02:22.449
(gasping)

02:22.536 --> 02:24.076
Homie, what is it?

02:24.164 --> 02:27.005
I had the most
horrible nightmare

02:27.093 --> 02:29.990
where I listened to your advice.

02:30.156 --> 02:31.726
<i>HOMER:
Okay, okay.</i>

02:31.814 --> 02:33.154
Okay, Homer, you can do this.

02:33.242 --> 02:34.461
You can make things right.

02:34.548 --> 02:35.750
(grunting)

02:37.384 --> 02:39.667
(imitates guitar)

02:39.976 --> 02:41.757
(gobbling)

02:43.702 --> 02:45.599
Mr. Burns, everyone who signed

02:45.687 --> 02:47.872
that birthday card chipped in
except for you.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.874
You owe five dollars.

02:49.997 --> 02:52.085
How dare you...

02:52.296 --> 02:54.548
give that the slightest worry.

02:54.635 --> 02:56.341
Hope you didn't lose any sleep

02:56.429 --> 02:58.075
over this little
misunderstanding.

02:58.163 --> 03:00.409
Here, have a cricket
on a thread for good luck.

03:00.497 --> 03:01.663
(chirps)

03:04.044 --> 03:05.526
You monster...

03:05.613 --> 03:07.027
taking advantage of an old man.

03:07.114 --> 03:08.295
What are you talking about?

03:08.382 --> 03:09.958
Mr. Burns is heavily medicated

03:10.046 --> 03:12.366
on a round‐the‐clock regimen
of skin thickeners.

03:14.154 --> 03:15.382
(sighs)

03:15.923 --> 03:17.471
The side effect
of that medication

03:17.558 --> 03:19.473
is bouts
of uncontrollable decency.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.341
And you exploited that.

03:21.428 --> 03:23.811
I'm demoting you
to the worst job in this place:

03:24.023 --> 03:26.680
supervising
the nuclear plant interns.

03:26.767 --> 03:28.282
[♪♪]

03:28.369 --> 03:29.507
(groans nervously)

03:31.739 --> 03:32.968
(chirps)

03:33.601 --> 03:34.888
(bird caws)

03:35.109 --> 03:37.388
Listen up, millenniums.
I'm Homer Simpson,

03:37.476 --> 03:38.749
your new supervisor.

03:38.837 --> 03:41.497
So stop Snapchatting,
Fortnite‐ing

03:41.585 --> 03:44.413
and swiping right
on your Uber Venmos.

03:44.882 --> 03:47.606
We're actually replicating
plant start‐up sequences

03:47.694 --> 03:50.370
to simulate the effects
of high‐demand energy draws.

03:50.458 --> 03:52.695
Contamination versus
irradiation...

03:52.783 --> 03:53.638
your thoughts?

03:53.726 --> 03:54.842
Address rate of reaction.

03:54.929 --> 03:57.010
What variables can we assume?

03:57.310 --> 03:59.413
Uh...

03:59.500 --> 04:03.383
<i>Der... Uh... Der‐der...</i>

04:03.490 --> 04:04.952
<i>Der...</i>

04:05.419 --> 04:08.247
This guy is denser
than osmium‐188.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.917
(interns laugh)

04:13.279 --> 04:15.395
Are my ears hearing this?

04:15.482 --> 04:17.731
Are you seriously busting
the clangers

04:17.817 --> 04:19.533
of Homer J. Simpsons?

04:19.620 --> 04:23.120
This man is a god and his
clangers are unbustable.

04:23.208 --> 04:25.167
You're looking
at the Michael Jordan

04:25.255 --> 04:26.673
of Sector 7G.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.877
And you humps aren't worthy
to swill his backwash.

04:29.964 --> 04:32.120
You're sticking up for me?

04:32.208 --> 04:33.198
Who are you?

04:33.286 --> 04:35.472
Mike Wegman, nuclear intern.

04:35.560 --> 04:36.917
And your number one fan.

04:37.004 --> 04:39.019
Yeah, well, your hero
has a Pop‐Tart

04:39.106 --> 04:40.687
in his cell phone holster.

04:40.774 --> 04:42.776
‐(laughter)
‐(groans)

04:45.880 --> 04:47.327
Are you kidding?

04:47.414 --> 04:48.662
(groans angrily)

04:48.891 --> 04:52.065
No one disrespects
Homer Simpsons.

04:52.152 --> 04:55.795
Not you, Ricky,
with your standing desk.

04:55.883 --> 04:58.105
It's not a workout;
it's been disproven.

04:58.192 --> 04:59.673
And not you, Gretchen,

04:59.760 --> 05:02.108
drinking coffee creamer
straight from the bottle.

05:02.196 --> 05:04.244
You exude amaretto, you freak.

05:04.331 --> 05:07.178
And, Benjamin, no one ever
got trampled

05:07.266 --> 05:09.049
at a Michael Bublé concert.

05:09.136 --> 05:12.219
Drop the friggin' lawsuit,
you're clogging up the system.

05:12.306 --> 05:14.157
This man is a dynamo.

05:14.245 --> 05:17.623
So you shaved coconuts
give him your full respect.

05:17.711 --> 05:20.006
All right, all right.
Sorry, Mr. Simpson.

05:20.094 --> 05:22.020
Looking forward to learning
from you, Mr. Simpson.

05:22.107 --> 05:25.207
People at work usually yell
at me, not for me.

05:25.295 --> 05:26.500
How do you know who I am?

05:26.587 --> 05:29.699
(laughs) So modest.
What a dynamo.

05:29.787 --> 05:31.668
‐Because of this.
‐Hmm?

05:31.756 --> 05:32.973
Whenever there's trouble,

05:33.060 --> 05:35.475
you are at the heart
of the action.

05:35.562 --> 05:38.465
Number six is why
all those horses went bald.

05:38.553 --> 05:41.527
Yeah. Well, I‐I‐I've been
looking up to you for so long

05:41.615 --> 05:44.098
from the cheap seats, and now
we're finally face‐to‐face,

05:44.186 --> 05:46.527
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I got to ask,

05:46.615 --> 05:49.021
w‐will you be my coach?
My sensei?

05:49.109 --> 05:51.992
Homer J. Simpsons,
will you be my mentor?

05:52.079 --> 05:53.154
(gasps)

05:53.248 --> 05:56.163
[♪♪]

05:56.250 --> 05:57.664
If you accept, let me know

05:57.751 --> 05:59.806
by taking this half a PowerBar.

05:59.894 --> 06:02.761
I rolled up the wrapper really
good so there's no pocket lint.

06:02.886 --> 06:06.440
Mike Wegmans,
I will be your mentor.

06:06.527 --> 06:08.529
(sighs)

06:18.369 --> 06:20.453
Okay, which of these ties
is better

06:20.541 --> 06:22.656
for my first day as a mentor?

06:22.743 --> 06:25.158
Purple stripes or this one?

06:25.245 --> 06:27.953
(sniffs)
Are you wearing my perfume?

06:28.041 --> 06:30.330
I like it on you,
he'll like it on me.

06:30.417 --> 06:32.299
Dad, it's not often that you...

06:32.386 --> 06:33.567
how do I put this?

06:33.654 --> 06:36.236
Care so much about your job?

06:36.323 --> 06:39.506
Well, now that I'm a mentor,
everything's changed.

06:39.593 --> 06:41.842
For the first time,
another human being

06:41.929 --> 06:44.478
is dependent on me
to guide them through life.

06:44.565 --> 06:46.847
(Bart and Lisa groaning)

06:46.934 --> 06:49.216
This guy I'm menting is so cool.

06:49.303 --> 06:51.418
He listens with his mouth open.

06:51.505 --> 06:54.955
He's been blocked by so many
celebrities on Twitter.

06:55.042 --> 06:56.890
And he thinks I'm
the most valuable worker

06:56.977 --> 06:58.807
at the entire nuclear plant.

06:58.895 --> 07:00.088
Oh, I get it.

07:00.176 --> 07:02.529
He's super dumb. (laughs)

07:02.762 --> 07:04.471
Mock all you want.

07:04.559 --> 07:07.488
I finally have someone at work
who admires me.

07:08.673 --> 07:10.889
(all laughing)

07:11.340 --> 07:12.687
He's fat.

07:12.848 --> 07:14.463
Homer, your pants.

07:14.551 --> 07:16.121
They'll come around again.

07:16.301 --> 07:17.831
They always do.

07:20.137 --> 07:21.548
There's my thoroughbred.

07:21.635 --> 07:23.550
I‐I got your coffee
just the way you like it.

07:23.637 --> 07:25.639
No coffee, just doughnut holes.

07:27.541 --> 07:30.213
Oh, my God,
are you busting my bricks?

07:30.301 --> 07:31.425
I‐Is this real?

07:31.512 --> 07:33.060
Sector 7G.

07:33.184 --> 07:36.541
7G, where Olympus fears
to tread.

07:36.629 --> 07:37.767
He sure does.

07:37.855 --> 07:41.127
Okay, you are a category five
hurricane of knowledge,

07:41.215 --> 07:44.041
and I'm like that old idiot
who won't leave his beach house.

07:44.129 --> 07:46.573
Please, drown my in my attic
with what you know.

07:46.660 --> 07:48.141
I thought you might say that.

07:48.228 --> 07:51.778
So I've prepared
inspirational posters.

07:51.865 --> 07:53.447
I feel like Amar'e Stoudemire

07:53.535 --> 07:55.793
when he first set foot
in Jerusalem.

07:56.004 --> 07:58.118
(chuckling)

07:58.205 --> 07:59.526
W‐What else you got?

07:59.614 --> 08:01.026
‐Uh, let's see...
‐Uh‐huh.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.847
‐Don't forget about the, uh...
‐Y‐Y‐Y‐Y‐Y‐Yeah.

08:02.934 --> 08:04.276
‐Oh, uh, and, of course,
‐Gold.

08:04.364 --> 08:05.425
‐you got to, you just got to.
‐Gold. Okay.

08:05.512 --> 08:07.214
‐Because if you don't...
‐Soakin' it in. Gold.

08:07.301 --> 08:08.428
‐Well, oh.
‐Soakin' it in.

08:08.515 --> 08:09.930
‐Well, they don't have that anymore.
‐I can remember this.

08:10.017 --> 08:11.431
‐And you see these?
‐Yeah.

08:11.518 --> 08:13.700
‐I'm gonna tell you that later.
‐Y‐Y‐Y‐Y‐Y‐Yeah.

08:13.787 --> 08:15.179
I can't believe this.

08:15.267 --> 08:18.060
I‐I'm only 35 and I am sitting
at the feet

08:18.148 --> 08:19.999
of the atomic Baba Booey.

08:20.101 --> 08:22.523
Mm. You're 35?

08:22.647 --> 08:24.277
Then why do you have a job
of a 20‐year‐old

08:24.364 --> 08:25.946
and talk like a ten‐year‐old?

08:26.033 --> 08:26.980
Here's how it is.

08:27.067 --> 08:28.448
So, my buddy 'Nesto and me

08:28.535 --> 08:29.716
were cleaning gutters for cash,

08:29.803 --> 08:32.152
when that idiot 'Nesto falls off

08:32.240 --> 08:35.017
and lands on a doghouse.
Stupid 'Nesto.

08:35.250 --> 08:37.624
Then my parents are on my case
to get a real career,

08:37.711 --> 08:39.458
something
"closer to the ground."

08:39.546 --> 08:41.495
So I thought,
"Why not follow my hero

08:41.582 --> 08:43.964
"into man's greatest calling?

08:44.051 --> 08:45.465
Nuclear whatever."

08:45.552 --> 08:46.967
So I went down to the plant,

08:47.054 --> 08:48.635
told them I was part
Native American...

08:48.722 --> 08:50.876
I could be,
I always liked those guys...

08:50.964 --> 08:52.899
and boom! I'm an intern.

08:52.987 --> 08:55.704
Three short years later,
got myself a mentor.

08:55.792 --> 08:58.673
Wow. My posters really worked.

08:58.761 --> 09:00.837
But you don't need me
telling you how great you are,

09:00.925 --> 09:02.582
y‐you get enough of that
at home.

09:02.669 --> 09:04.404
<i>(distorted laughter)</i>

09:06.373 --> 09:08.989
<i>BURNS:
Happy birthday, Lenny.</i>

09:09.076 --> 09:10.424
Say, Mike,

09:10.512 --> 09:13.663
why don't you come over
to my house for dinner?

09:13.755 --> 09:15.956
I've got some people
I'd like to introduce

09:16.044 --> 09:17.768
to the way you act around me.

09:17.856 --> 09:19.576
Okay. I‐I could do that.

09:19.724 --> 09:21.168
I could make that happen.

09:21.357 --> 09:22.669
Huh. I got this.

09:22.951 --> 09:24.964
Hey, Lenny,
you duck‐faced psycho,

09:25.052 --> 09:27.193
guess who's going
to Homer Simpson's house

09:27.281 --> 09:28.788
for a meal? Me.

09:28.876 --> 09:30.296
CARL:
Uh, I'm Carl.

09:30.507 --> 09:31.777
[♪♪]

09:31.865 --> 09:33.825
I wish you would give me
more of a heads‐up

09:33.913 --> 09:36.247
before inviting a mentee
for dinner.

09:36.335 --> 09:37.484
I guess we'll have enough

09:37.571 --> 09:41.296
if I double the chip layer
on the casserole.

09:41.468 --> 09:44.391
Don't worry,
you're gonna love this kid.

09:44.617 --> 09:47.091
Kid? He looks 40‐plus.

09:47.179 --> 09:50.006
Oh, Homer, she is a beaut.

09:50.094 --> 09:52.343
Now I know why you're always
napping at work.

09:52.430 --> 09:54.208
Mr. Plow, indeed.

09:54.296 --> 09:56.046
Hello. I'm Marge.

09:56.133 --> 09:57.835
Mike Wegman.
This is Maureen.

09:57.923 --> 10:00.551
And this
is Patrick Ewing Wegman.

10:00.638 --> 10:03.320
It's a girl.
You can't name her Patrick.

10:03.407 --> 10:06.161
2.4 blocks per game, lifetime.

10:06.249 --> 10:07.691
She's Patrick.

10:07.778 --> 10:09.226
Look at this spread.

10:09.313 --> 10:11.495
I‐I was expecting, like,
a‐a party sub,

10:11.582 --> 10:14.298
but hot carrots?
Who thinks of that?

10:14.385 --> 10:16.800
Slow it, you'll burn
your mouth again.

10:16.887 --> 10:18.469
All right, all right,
I'm gonna blow on 'em.

10:18.556 --> 10:19.803
(blowing)

10:19.890 --> 10:21.605
Thank you for having us.

10:21.692 --> 10:24.408
Mike admires your husband
so much.

10:24.495 --> 10:26.410
Do you hear that? "So much"!

10:26.497 --> 10:28.445
They don't admire me <i>any</i> much.

10:28.532 --> 10:30.080
(chuckles)

10:30.167 --> 10:31.982
You better hold on
to this guy, Marge,

10:32.069 --> 10:34.225
'cause if he were single,
he'd be cleaning up.

10:34.313 --> 10:36.928
I mean <i>cleaning up,</i> knee‐deep.

10:37.016 --> 10:38.132
(chuckles):
Don't worry, honey.

10:38.219 --> 10:40.267
You're the only woman for me.

10:40.355 --> 10:41.636
I wasn't worried.

10:42.443 --> 10:45.194
So, Mrs. Wegman,
how did you two meet?

10:45.282 --> 10:47.097
Oh, well,
you're gonna love this story.

10:47.185 --> 10:49.083
It's so romantic.
Tell her, honey.

10:49.171 --> 10:50.215
Go ahead, tell her.

10:50.303 --> 10:52.067
He was a waiter at my wedding.

10:52.155 --> 10:54.333
She was so beautiful,
like one of those girls

10:54.421 --> 10:56.507
you see leaving Vinny's bedroom
on <i>Entourage</i>

10:56.595 --> 10:57.822
that don't say nothin'.

10:57.910 --> 10:59.069
(Mike laughs)

10:59.157 --> 11:00.392
(slurps)

11:02.811 --> 11:04.864
So, Mike, you seem
like a sharp tack.

11:04.952 --> 11:06.650
What exactly is
my dad teaching you?

11:06.737 --> 11:08.919
How to eat doughnuts
while napping?

11:09.006 --> 11:10.487
(snorts, laughs)

11:10.574 --> 11:13.501
Did this little hump just say
what I thought I heard?

11:13.589 --> 11:15.125
It's okay, Mike.
I don't sweat it.

11:15.212 --> 11:17.494
Yeah, Mike, the only thing
Homer sweats is gravy.

11:17.581 --> 11:19.016
‐(laughs)
‐(groans angrily)

11:20.566 --> 11:23.520
No one disrespects
Homer Simpsons!

11:23.608 --> 11:26.803
Especially not
an ugly little punk like you.

11:26.890 --> 11:28.333
That's right, I said "ugly."

11:28.421 --> 11:30.301
Your head looks like
a rejected Muppet.

11:30.389 --> 11:32.805
Two golf balls glued
to a can of oats.

11:32.893 --> 11:36.434
Between that Tommy Lasorda gut
and those toothpick legs,

11:36.522 --> 11:40.326
you are not a kid...
you are a walkin' potato clock.

11:41.952 --> 11:45.208
Ha‐ha‐ha! Ugly! Ha!

11:45.296 --> 11:46.974
(laughing uncontrollably)

11:47.062 --> 11:49.827
Muppet...
(continues laughing)

11:49.914 --> 11:53.421
Ah! Toothpick legs!

11:53.742 --> 11:54.989
Potato clock!

11:55.085 --> 11:56.921
(sobbing)

12:01.194 --> 12:02.858
I'm just bustin'
your clangers, kid.

12:02.946 --> 12:03.735
All right, it's okay.

12:03.823 --> 12:05.819
I want you out!

12:06.733 --> 12:08.899
(Bart sobbing)

12:11.460 --> 12:14.017
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

12:14.374 --> 12:16.733
Where's the baby registered?!

12:16.827 --> 12:18.722
MAUREEN:
DraftKings!

12:18.809 --> 12:21.724
How many times
do I have to say I'm sorry?

12:21.812 --> 12:23.405
Once would be nice.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.648
Wow, you're really bustin'
my clangers.

12:25.736 --> 12:27.117
That guy's a lunatic.

12:27.205 --> 12:28.452
He's not crazy.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.289
He's the only one
that respects me!

12:30.377 --> 12:32.419
The kids and I respect you.

12:32.507 --> 12:34.450
All you guys ever did
was love me.

12:34.538 --> 12:36.940
But look me in the eyes
and tell me you respect me,

12:37.027 --> 12:38.776
as a nuclear guy.

12:38.968 --> 12:40.764
(laughs nervously)

12:44.585 --> 12:45.715
I just liked the feeling

12:45.803 --> 12:48.385
that one person thinks
I'm good at something.

12:48.472 --> 12:50.669
Mm, I get it, Homie.

12:50.757 --> 12:52.916
But if you really want
to help this guy,

12:53.004 --> 12:54.872
help him grow up.

12:55.455 --> 12:56.469
(groans softly)

12:56.557 --> 12:57.804
(bird caws)

12:58.569 --> 12:59.755
MIKE:
Come on, Fordham,

12:59.843 --> 13:01.068
Bucknell's got
no rim protection.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.434
They're garbage.
Just cover the spread.

13:03.521 --> 13:04.601
(groans)

13:04.688 --> 13:06.236
Hey, Homer.
How's it clangin'?

13:06.323 --> 13:08.841
I'm, uh, just tunin' in
to a little college hoops.

13:08.929 --> 13:10.941
Yeah, Mike, I was thinking,

13:11.028 --> 13:14.945
if you weren't
a 35‐year‐old unpaid intern

13:15.032 --> 13:18.481
with a baby on the way,
do you have any other dreams?

13:18.569 --> 13:21.317
Ah, man, you are
mentoring me hard right now.

13:21.405 --> 13:23.810
Oh, okay, I'm gonna tell you,
but don't laugh.

13:23.898 --> 13:24.974
I won't.

13:25.062 --> 13:26.817
‐Slices.
‐Uh‐huh.

13:26.905 --> 13:29.060
Nothing better than getting
a slice of pizza, right?

13:29.148 --> 13:31.895
But it's always been under
the heat lamp all dried out.

13:31.982 --> 13:33.624
Damn heat lamp.

13:33.712 --> 13:36.632
Right. So why not make the pizza
one slice at a time,

13:36.720 --> 13:37.726
hot and fresh?

13:37.814 --> 13:40.099
Every slice is Derek Jeter.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.388
No Scott Brosius in the bunch.

13:42.476 --> 13:44.623
(gasps)
That's genius!

13:44.711 --> 13:46.515
Oh, my God,
I can't believe you like it.

13:46.632 --> 13:49.687
Mike! You know what you
should call your slices?

13:49.793 --> 13:52.216
Mike's Slices.

13:52.304 --> 13:53.382
I'm Mike!

13:53.470 --> 13:55.960
Yeah! Okay,
what you need is an investor,

13:56.048 --> 13:58.421
and I know the perfect person.

13:58.586 --> 14:00.622
He gave me five dollars.

14:01.115 --> 14:03.197
<i>Every</i> slice hot and fresh

14:03.285 --> 14:05.421
from the oven into your mouth.

14:05.534 --> 14:07.549
Every slice a Jeter.

14:07.653 --> 14:10.179
No Scott Brosiuses.

14:10.276 --> 14:13.192
Why can't I get a whole pizza
and slice it myself?

14:13.280 --> 14:14.728
There are no whole pizzas.

14:14.816 --> 14:17.472
It's just slices, hot and fresh.

14:17.560 --> 14:20.175
And don't worry about investing
with this guy, Mr. Burns,

14:20.263 --> 14:22.962
because he's backed
by the full mentorship

14:23.050 --> 14:25.049
of Homer J. Simpsons.

14:25.410 --> 14:27.511
Then it's my pleasure
to tell you...

14:27.599 --> 14:31.355
that that is the stupidest idea
I've ever heard.

14:31.443 --> 14:34.293
Get this intern out
of my office, you nincompoop!

14:34.381 --> 14:35.418
(groans angrily)

14:35.570 --> 14:36.918
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:37.006 --> 14:41.707
Ho! No one disrespects
Homer J. Simpsons.

14:41.808 --> 14:43.043
No, Mike, don't.

14:43.131 --> 14:43.938
Nin...

14:44.026 --> 14:45.340
com... poop!

14:45.458 --> 14:47.994
Listen to me, you skunk‐bag
full of Centrum Silver

14:48.082 --> 14:49.800
sitting
on your peanut brittle ass

14:49.888 --> 14:51.758
with your turn‐of‐the‐century
buzzard face.

14:51.873 --> 14:54.548
You ain't worthy to squeegee
this man's back sweat.

14:54.636 --> 14:56.634
You smell like Chinese food
that someone left

14:56.722 --> 14:57.988
in an old jack‐o'‐lantern.

14:58.076 --> 15:01.439
My mentor is the shiniest
diamond in the whole Zales,

15:01.527 --> 15:04.064
so stuff your organs
back in their jars

15:04.152 --> 15:06.049
and crawl in your mummy box,

15:06.144 --> 15:08.996
you sick, fungused‐up,
hep‐C Dracula!

15:10.226 --> 15:11.808
(gasps)

15:11.896 --> 15:14.027
By the way,
he's off his happy pills.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.845
You're lucky Mr. Burns's gun
was 200 years old.

15:20.933 --> 15:22.361
Yeah, but now my doctor says

15:22.449 --> 15:24.276
I can't get shot
in the face again.

15:24.363 --> 15:26.278
Who's ugly now, pellet‐head?

15:26.365 --> 15:28.074
(chuckles mockingly)

15:29.086 --> 15:31.282
Come on, it's okay. Don't cry.

15:31.370 --> 15:34.252
I'm not. All the BBs in my head
are making it heavy.

15:34.339 --> 15:35.954
Mike, this is all my fault.

15:36.041 --> 15:38.824
I know you think I'm a great
nuclear guy, but I'm not.

15:38.911 --> 15:40.668
I didn't stop those accidents.

15:40.756 --> 15:41.902
I caused them.

15:41.990 --> 15:43.800
‐Huh? No. No.
‐(BBs clattering)

15:43.888 --> 15:46.041
All my posters...
"Bet on Yourself,"

15:46.129 --> 15:47.666
"Go Big or Go Home"...

15:47.753 --> 15:50.468
I was caught shoplifting those
from a poster store.

15:50.555 --> 15:53.899
I was trying to go big, and
they wouldn't let me go home.

15:53.987 --> 15:57.540
Mike, face it, I'm a bad mentor.

15:57.628 --> 16:00.647
No one disrespects
Homer Simpsons.

16:00.735 --> 16:01.618
Not even you.

16:01.706 --> 16:04.600
You're the best mentor
a lousy bride‐banger like me

16:04.688 --> 16:05.602
could ever ask for.

16:05.690 --> 16:06.985
And I'm gonna prove it.

16:07.073 --> 16:07.961
‐(door closes)
‐Who spilled BBs

16:08.049 --> 16:10.672
‐all over the... whoa!
‐(BBs clattering)

16:13.063 --> 16:15.188
MIKE:
Yo! Mentor!

16:16.682 --> 16:19.831
("That's Amore" instrumental
playing over P. A.)

16:19.918 --> 16:21.533
(tires screech)

16:21.977 --> 16:23.835
Anybody want a slice of pizza

16:23.922 --> 16:26.123
that wasn't sliced from a pizza?

16:26.211 --> 16:27.751
Where'd you get a food truck?

16:27.839 --> 16:30.835
It's all cause of you, mentor,
all cause of you. Deal with it.

16:30.930 --> 16:33.295
The boys and I
will take a large pie.

16:33.420 --> 16:35.162
Can't you read a truck,
Cookie Puss?

16:35.250 --> 16:36.398
Slices only!

16:36.486 --> 16:38.334
All righty,
three slices, please.

16:38.570 --> 16:42.187
They'll be ready in 13,
26 and 39 minutes.

16:42.274 --> 16:44.092
And don't block the window,
sizzle chest.

16:44.180 --> 16:46.762
When will <i>my</i> slice be ready?

16:46.850 --> 16:49.553
And by "slice,"
I mean the first payment

16:49.705 --> 16:52.120
on your outstanding loan.

16:52.317 --> 16:54.858
You borrowed money
from the mob?!

16:54.946 --> 16:56.920
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's all good.

16:57.008 --> 17:00.124
I took a one‐week loan from
Fat Tony for a hundred grand.

17:00.227 --> 17:02.382
I put $50k into the truck

17:02.470 --> 17:04.992
and then bet the other 50
on tonight's Lehigh game,

17:05.080 --> 17:06.111
which is a lock.

17:06.198 --> 17:08.267
So when I win the bet,
I pay back the mob,

17:08.355 --> 17:10.569
and I own the truck
free and clear.

17:10.657 --> 17:11.906
Oh, no.

17:11.993 --> 17:14.276
You bet on yourself!

17:14.364 --> 17:16.613
Go big or go home, baby.

17:17.321 --> 17:18.665
<i>ANNOUNCER:

17:18.752 --> 17:21.228
<i>as Holy Cross goes

17:21.316 --> 17:24.233
(shouts)
No, no, no, Lehigh is a lock!

17:24.321 --> 17:27.069
They're undefeated on floors
with hockey ice beneath them.

17:27.212 --> 17:30.628
Yet again, a man's life hangs
by the gossamer thread

17:30.716 --> 17:33.332
of Patriot League basketball.

17:33.631 --> 17:34.921
Guns up.

17:35.009 --> 17:36.381

18:15.534 --> 18:19.604
HOMER:
(gasps) A food truck graveyard.

18:25.544 --> 18:28.093
Why are there
so many failed ones?

18:28.180 --> 18:31.183
'Cause they don't have
an original concept, like me.

18:34.352 --> 18:35.587
(tires screech)

18:40.197 --> 18:42.199
(Homer whimpering)

18:43.762 --> 18:45.110
(both gasp)

18:45.352 --> 18:48.082
(both moaning nervously)

18:48.614 --> 18:50.480
Homer, I got to tell you
one thing.

18:50.602 --> 18:51.983
Your boy's not ugly.

18:52.070 --> 18:53.176
He's gorgeous.

18:53.264 --> 18:54.712
Just like his old man.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.214
He's gonna clean up.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.017
Tell baby Patrick I loved her.

18:58.110 --> 18:59.912
All right, do me.

19:01.046 --> 19:02.160
(sniffing)

19:02.247 --> 19:04.153
I smell mozzarella

19:04.241 --> 19:08.770
gently melting over a single
slice of triangular dough.

19:08.986 --> 19:12.895
Before the end,
we will share a pie.

19:12.983 --> 19:15.341
It's just slices,
you goombah caveman!

19:16.761 --> 19:19.096
Mmm! Usually a slice
is dried out

19:19.184 --> 19:22.013
from sitting under a heat lamp,
but this is hot and fresh!

19:22.100 --> 19:24.149
See? This guy has good ideas.

19:24.236 --> 19:25.650
What if...

19:25.737 --> 19:29.382
you let Mike work in the truck
to pay you back?

19:29.841 --> 19:32.490
No. The food truck business
is too big a gamble.

19:32.577 --> 19:34.893
And even our gambling operation
is in trouble

19:34.980 --> 19:38.196
with the advent
of legal online wagering.

19:38.283 --> 19:40.565
Too bad you can't take action
out of my food truck,

19:40.652 --> 19:42.067
let the betting come to you.

19:42.154 --> 19:43.868
Now, do me already!

19:43.956 --> 19:46.592
A food truck that takes bets?

19:48.734 --> 19:50.784
I'll take a slice of cheese

19:50.872 --> 19:53.041
and the moneyline on Georgetown.

19:54.890 --> 19:57.886
Yo, Tony! We're raking it in
on the sportsbook.

19:57.974 --> 20:01.351
And it was a great idea to sell
weed out of this thing also.

20:04.142 --> 20:07.606
Homer, you believed
in this <i>stagelagoots</i>

20:07.694 --> 20:09.023
when no one else would.

20:09.154 --> 20:12.062
You listened to him,
nurtured his ideas,

20:12.150 --> 20:14.086
and now he is a success.

20:14.174 --> 20:15.211
Truly,

20:15.299 --> 20:18.055
you are an excellent mentor.
