WEBVTT

00:05.458 --> 00:08.667
THE COMMODORE 64,
THE LAWN DART,

00:08.667 --> 00:10.667
THE ROCK-N-SOCKEM
ROBOTS,

00:10.667 --> 00:12.542
SUPER SUGAR CRISP,
THE LASERDISC,

00:12.542 --> 00:15.125
AND NOW, BACK
FROM THE HALLS
OF OBSOLESCENCE,

00:15.125 --> 00:16.834
THE BETAMAX MACHINE.

00:16.834 --> 00:18.208
HEY, MAN,
YOU ARE A LIFESAVER.

00:18.208 --> 00:21.583
I GOT LESS THAN 48 HOURS
TO BECOME AN EXPERT
DOCUMENTARIAN,

00:21.583 --> 00:23.667
AND ALL MOM'S NEWSREELS
ARE ON BETA.

00:23.667 --> 00:27.875
WHAT? DAWSON LEERY
ESCHEWING THE EPHEMERAL
WORLD OF MAKE-BELIEVE

00:27.875 --> 00:30.417
FOR THE GRITTY REALITIES
OF REAL LIFE?

00:30.417 --> 00:32.250
HAS THE WORLD
SPUN OFF COURSE?

00:32.250 --> 00:33.458
WAS THE DALAI LAMA
SPOTTED AT BLACK ANGUS?

00:33.458 --> 00:36.917
MORE LIKE MY MOTHER'S BEEN
DANGLING A BIG FAT CARROT.

00:36.917 --> 00:38.834
HUMAN INTEREST STORY
SHE WAS WORKING ON
AT THE NETWORK

00:38.834 --> 00:39.667
FELL OUT AT
THE LAST MINUTE.

00:39.667 --> 00:41.041
AND?

00:41.041 --> 00:42.166
AND SHE SAYS
THAT IF I CAN EDIT

00:42.166 --> 00:44.208
SOME RAW FOOTAGE
BY FRIDAY MORNING,

00:44.208 --> 00:45.542
THERE'S A CHANCE
SHE COULD WHIP IT INTO SHAPE

00:45.542 --> 00:47.208
AND BE ON THE AIR
THAT NIGHT.

00:47.208 --> 00:48.792
HEY, IT'S THE CHANCE
OF A LIFETIME.

00:48.792 --> 00:50.083
THAT'LL MAKE A GUY
CHANGE HIS VISION.

00:50.083 --> 00:51.875
WELL, IT'S
A TEMPORARY CHANGE.

00:51.875 --> 00:53.208
AS SOON AS I GET
MY FOOT IN THAT
PROVERBIAL DOOR,

00:53.208 --> 00:55.417
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
IN THE MAGICAL LAND
OF MAKE-BELIEVE.

00:55.417 --> 00:56.542
I DON'T KNOW,
DAWSON.

00:56.542 --> 00:58.708
I MEAN,
YOU GOT AN AMAZING
OPPORTUNITY HERE

00:58.708 --> 00:59.792
TO CHANGE
YOUR WHOLE GENRE.

00:59.792 --> 01:02.375
REAL-LIFE STORIES ARE
ALWAYS MORE COMPELLING

01:02.375 --> 01:04.125
THAN ANYTHING YOU COULD
POSSIBLY DREAM UP.

01:04.125 --> 01:05.583
REAL LIFE IS INTERESTING,

01:05.583 --> 01:08.208
BUT IT WILL
NEVER BE AS DRAMATIC AS
A WELL-CONCEIVED NARRATIVE.

01:08.208 --> 01:10.417
LOOK AT EVERYTHING
THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING
IN YOUR LIFE LATELY.

01:10.417 --> 01:12.959
ARE YOU HONESTLY TELLING
ME THAT YOU COULD
CONCEIVE OF SOMETHING

01:12.959 --> 01:15.458
MORE THRILLING,
MORE SEXY, AND
MORE FAR-FETCHED?

01:15.458 --> 01:17.792
HUH?

01:17.792 --> 01:18.750
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

01:18.750 --> 01:20.792
WHO'S YOUR GUINEA PIG?

01:20.792 --> 01:22.959
IT'S JACK McPHEE.

01:22.959 --> 01:24.166
AGAIN?

01:24.166 --> 01:26.375
GAY KID JOINS
LOSING HIGH SCHOOL
FOOTBALL TEAM,

01:26.375 --> 01:29.458
OVERCOMES ADVERSITY,
BATTLES ANTIQUATED
STEREOTYPES,

01:29.458 --> 01:30.917
AND ENDS UP
BECOMING THE STAR.

01:30.917 --> 01:31.917
NOW, IF YOU'RE GONNA
MESS WITH THAT STORY,

01:31.917 --> 01:33.542
YOU'D JUST BE GILDING
THE LILY, DAWSON.

01:33.542 --> 01:34.417
IT'S A GREAT STORY,
BUT YOU CAN'T JUST

01:34.417 --> 01:37.250
TURN THE CAMERA ON
AND LET IT RUN.

01:37.250 --> 01:38.166
WHY NOT?

01:38.166 --> 01:40.667
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

01:40.667 --> 01:41.583
IT SEEMS PRETTY
INTERESTING TO ME.

01:41.583 --> 01:44.750
MY MOM MUST'VE
TAPED OVER HER WORK.

01:44.750 --> 01:46.625
HONEY, THIS IS DAWSON.
CAN YOU SAY HI?

01:46.625 --> 01:47.166
HI.

01:47.166 --> 01:49.750
HE'S MY FRIEND.

01:49.750 --> 01:51.375
IS THAT WHO
I THINK IT IS?

01:54.458 --> 01:56.583
Dad: THIS IS JOEY, DAWSON,
CAN YOU SAY HI?

01:56.583 --> 01:59.875
HI, JOEY.

02:05.917 --> 02:09.542
ONCE A HEARTBREAKER,
ALWAYS A HEARTBREAKER,
HUH, DAWSON?

03:18.542 --> 03:20.542
MORNIN'.

03:20.542 --> 03:25.333
WHY DO YOU INSIST
ON DEGRADING YOUR
TEAM COLORS LIKE THAT?

03:25.333 --> 03:27.750
WELL, GRAMS,
THE FISHNETS
ONLY COME IN BLACK,

03:27.750 --> 03:29.959
AND THE MATCHING
LEATHER WHIP,

03:29.959 --> 03:30.375
IT'S ON BACK ORDER.

03:32.166 --> 03:33.375
JENNIFER.

03:33.375 --> 03:35.041
COME ON, GRAMS,
THE ENTIRE NOTION
OF CHEERLEADING

03:35.041 --> 03:36.208
IS JUST A SEXIST ATTEMPT

03:36.208 --> 03:38.917
TO TRY AND OBJECTIFY
THE FEMALE BODY.

03:38.917 --> 03:40.083
I'M MAKING A STATEMENT.

03:40.083 --> 03:42.041
YOU'RE MAKING A MOCKERY.

03:42.041 --> 03:44.667
THE MOCKERY
HAS BEEN MADE.

03:44.667 --> 03:46.792
I'M SIMPLY
POINTING IT OUT.

03:46.792 --> 03:48.041
ALTHOUGH,
I GOT TO TELL YA,

03:48.041 --> 03:49.083
I DON'T KNOW HOW
MANY MORE PEP RALLIES

03:49.083 --> 03:52.166
AND SPIRIT COOKIES
I CAN ACTUALLY STOMACH.

03:52.166 --> 03:54.959
YOUR SCHOOL HAS
AN IMPORTANT GAME COMING UP.

03:54.959 --> 03:59.417
RIGHT NOW THEY NEED
YOUR LEADERSHIP AND VERVE.

03:59.417 --> 04:01.291
BACK WHEN I WAS
ON THE PEP SQUAD,

04:01.291 --> 04:04.166
WE RELISHED THE OPPORTUNITY
TO SHOW OFF OUR TEAM SPIRIT

04:04.166 --> 04:06.417
BY WEARING OUR UNIFORMS
TO SCHOOL.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.500
GRAMS, I HATE
TO BREAK IT TO YOU,

04:11.500 --> 04:14.375
BUT YOU WERE SHOWING OFF
A BIT MORE THAN JUST
TEAM SPIRIT.

04:17.375 --> 04:19.959
JENNIFER.

04:23.750 --> 04:25.959
[LAUGHING]

04:36.750 --> 04:40.000
LIKE, OH, MY GOD,
GO TEAM. HA HA. HA HA.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.667
FOR A MINUTE I THOUGHT
YOU'D BEEN POSSESSED

04:41.667 --> 04:44.708
BY THESE SCHOOL SPIRIT
CREATURES FROM PLANET
OVERZEALOUS.

04:44.708 --> 04:46.083
NOT QUITE YET,
BUT I AM THINKING ABOUT

04:46.083 --> 04:48.000
MAKING A RUN FOR IT
BEFORE THE PODS HATCH.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.750
WHAT DO YOU SAY, SCULLY?

04:49.750 --> 04:51.083
CUT CLASS WITH YOU?

04:51.083 --> 04:54.667
SOUNDS DELECTABLE.
I'LL PASS.

04:54.667 --> 04:57.667
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT
THERE WAS A MISSION
TO MY MADNESS?

04:57.667 --> 04:58.834
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

04:58.834 --> 05:01.291
BUT OF COURSE.
ZE MISSEUR IN
THE STYLISH SHIRT

05:01.291 --> 05:03.417
REQUEST THE PRESENCE
OF THE MADAME

05:03.417 --> 05:05.792
FOR A VERY PRESSING
APPOINTMENT, JA?

05:05.792 --> 05:06.792
WHAT IS IT?

05:06.792 --> 05:08.458
WELL, THAT WOULD BE
THE SURPRISE PART.

05:08.458 --> 05:09.792
JUST TELL ME, PACEY.

05:09.792 --> 05:12.166
LET ME THINK
ABOUT THAT...NOPE.

05:12.166 --> 05:13.792
WELL, FINE.
YOU WON'T TELL ME,

05:13.792 --> 05:14.875
THEN I'M NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

05:14.875 --> 05:17.625
OH, LITTLE JOE,
YOU'RE SO CUTE.

05:17.625 --> 05:19.208
BUT FRIEND TO FRIEND,
HONESTLY,

05:19.208 --> 05:20.792
YOU SHOULD CHECK INTO
SOME MORE OF THOSE
FEIGNING DISINTEREST CLASSES.

05:20.792 --> 05:25.625
OH, THANKS.
BUT TRUST ME, PACEY,
I COULDN'T CARE LESS.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.375
WELL, OK.

05:27.375 --> 05:29.542
WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE
ACTUALLY INTERESTED,

05:29.542 --> 05:31.291
YOU HAVE ABOUT 10 SECONDS
TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND

05:31.291 --> 05:32.792
AFTER I ROUND THAT CORNER.
STARTING NOW.

05:32.792 --> 05:34.834
ONE...

05:34.834 --> 05:36.583
2...

05:36.583 --> 05:38.667
3...

05:44.000 --> 05:47.125
6 SECONDS?!

05:47.125 --> 05:50.250
6? I MEAN, COME ON.
HAVE YOU NO PRIDE?

05:50.250 --> 05:51.000
I THOUGHT YOU'D LAST
AT LEAST TO 8.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.375
I LOATHE YOU.

05:53.375 --> 05:55.708
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOCKED
AT HOW WELL YOU'VE
TAKEN TO THE GAME.

05:55.708 --> 05:57.500
DID YOU LOVE FOOTBALL
AS A CHILD?

05:57.500 --> 06:00.500
HEH. I'VE ONLY BEEN
PLAYING FOOTBALL
FOR A FEW WEEKS.

06:00.500 --> 06:03.750
I THINK THE ONLY SUBJECT
I KNOW LESS ABOUT IS
BEING GAY, ACTUALLY.

06:03.750 --> 06:06.250
I--I DON'T KNOW.

06:06.250 --> 06:07.250
SOME THINGS ARE
JUST INSTINCT MAYBE.

06:07.250 --> 06:09.667
WELL, ONE THING
JACK HAS LEARNED

06:09.667 --> 06:12.000
IS THE IMPORTANCE OF
STARTING PRACTICE ON TIME.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.625
GO STRETCH OUT TO RUN
YOUR 40s.
YES, SIR.

06:13.625 --> 06:15.875
AND TAKING A TENTH OFF
YESTERDAY DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN COAST.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.834
OK. GOTTA GO.

06:17.834 --> 06:19.041
UH, NO PROBLEM. AHEM.

06:19.041 --> 06:20.750
WE CAN TAKE CARE OF
THE COACH LEERY INTERVIEW.

06:20.750 --> 06:22.625
WHAT DO YOU SAY, DAD?

06:22.625 --> 06:23.875
UH, NOT NOW, DAWSON.

06:23.875 --> 06:25.000
BUT, DAD,
IT'S DUE TOMORROW.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.458
DAWSON, YOU CAN
GET AN EXTENSION.

06:27.458 --> 06:29.208
ME, I'VE GOT
A GAME ON SATURDAY,

06:29.208 --> 06:33.375
AND I NEED THESE GUYS
COMPLETELY FOCUSED
ON FOOTBALL, OK?

06:34.333 --> 06:36.166
PICK IT UP!

06:37.542 --> 06:39.500
HE WORE IT IN
THE BC/MIAMI GAME.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.625
SPIT IT OUT RIGHT AFTER
THROWING THE HAIL MARY.

06:41.625 --> 06:42.917
RIGHT WHEN
THE WHISTLE BLEW,

06:42.917 --> 06:46.208
MY BROTHER, HE RAN ONTO
THE FIELD AND GRABBED IT.

06:46.208 --> 06:47.583
WELL, THE DUDE'S GOT
SOME BIG MOLARS.

06:47.583 --> 06:49.166
THEY'RE CROWNS, ACTUALLY.

06:49.166 --> 06:51.166
CHECK OUT
THE NUMBER 2 BICUSPIDS.

06:51.166 --> 06:53.625
REMIND YOU OF ANYONE?

06:53.625 --> 06:55.875
HEY, WHAT'S
EVERYBODY LOOKING AT?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.917
OH, UH, WELL, APPARENTLY
WE'RE LOOKING AT

06:59.917 --> 07:01.583
DOUG FLUTIE'S
OLD MOUTHPIECE.

07:01.583 --> 07:03.417
A MOUTHPIECE?

07:05.041 --> 07:08.250
THAT WAS ACTUALLY
IN HIS MOUTH?

07:08.250 --> 07:10.458
WELL, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

07:12.417 --> 07:15.125
HENRY SAYS IT'S
HIS GOOD LUCK CHARM.

07:16.083 --> 07:18.250
HENRY NEEDS
HIS HEAD EXAMINED.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.500
WHAT AM I GONNA DO, JACK?

07:23.500 --> 07:25.625
I GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

07:25.625 --> 07:29.500
JEN LINDLEY, HER VOICE
IS THE SWEETEST MUSIC.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.834
HER VERY NAME IS
FIRE IN MY LOINS.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.542
UH, JUST A THOUGHT,
HENRY,

07:34.542 --> 07:37.667
BUT NEXT TIME YOU MIGHT
WANT TO JUST START
BY SAYING HELLO.

07:43.291 --> 07:45.625
HEY, WE MISSED YOU
THIS MORNING AT
THE SPIRIT TABLE.

07:45.625 --> 07:48.291
WHERE WERE YOU?
WE WERE WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

07:48.291 --> 07:50.083
LOOK, YOU GUYS, I STAYED
REALLY LATE AT THAT
PEP RALLY YESTERDAY,

07:50.083 --> 07:52.417
UM, I HAVE LIMITS.

07:52.417 --> 07:53.959
IS THIS
A LOW-IRON DAY?

07:53.959 --> 07:56.125
YEAH, TRY NOT TO LET
ANYONE ELSE SEE YOU,

07:56.125 --> 07:58.583
'CAUSE IT MIGHT HURT
THE AUCTION.

07:58.583 --> 07:59.542
AUCTION?

07:59.542 --> 08:00.458
THE SILENT AUCTION.

08:00.458 --> 08:02.542
YEAH, YOU SHOULD BE
REALLY PROUD.

08:02.542 --> 08:03.834
IT'S LIKE THE MOST
SUCCESSFUL ONE
WE'VE EVER HAD.

08:03.834 --> 08:06.834
LIKE, HALF THE SENIOR GUYS
HAVE ALREADY PUT IN THEIR BIDS.

08:07.834 --> 08:09.125
WHAT ARE YOU
AUCTIONING OFF?

08:09.125 --> 08:12.875
WELL, THE WINNER
GETS TO RIDE IN
ON THE MINUTEMAN MULE

08:12.875 --> 08:14.166
AT THE END OF THE GAME.

08:14.166 --> 08:16.250
UH-HUH,
AND RECEIVE A KISS FROM
THE HEAD CHEERLEADER.

08:16.250 --> 08:20.083
OH, NO, THEY DON'T.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.917
NOW, JENNY--

08:21.917 --> 08:24.458
JEN. OK? IT'S JEN.

08:24.458 --> 08:27.041
YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE THING
JUST STARTED AS A BAD JOKE,

08:27.041 --> 08:29.333
AN EXCUSE TO GET OUT
OF BIOLOGY,

08:29.333 --> 08:30.959
BUT DO YOU SEE
WHAT IT'S TURNED INTO?

08:30.959 --> 08:34.332
I HAVE PRANCED AROUND
IN FRONT OF THIS ENTIRE
SCHOOL AT PEP RALLIES

08:34.332 --> 08:36.833
WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING
WHAT THE HELL PEP IS.

08:36.833 --> 08:39.875
I HAVE LISTENED TO
CLACK AND PRATTLE
ABOUT CAR WASHES,

08:39.875 --> 08:41.332
DANCE-A-THONS,
AND DOG-SITTING

08:41.332 --> 08:43.250
UNTIL I THINK I'M GONNA
PUKE UP MY HOMEMADE
SPIRIT COOKIES.

08:43.250 --> 08:44.417
JENNY--

08:44.417 --> 08:46.333
AND DESPITE THIS ITCH
I AM GETTING ON MY ASS

08:46.333 --> 08:47.667
FROM THIS POLYESTER
MOLEST-ME SKIRT,

08:47.667 --> 08:50.166
I'VE DONE IT ALL WITH
A SMILE ON MY FACE.

08:50.166 --> 08:52.041
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, LADIES,
THE SMILE IS GONE.

08:52.041 --> 08:54.417
I'M SORRY, BUT THERE IS
NO WAY I'M GOING TO BE
SOLD OFF

08:54.417 --> 08:56.583
LIKE SOME HAREM GIRL
TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.

08:56.583 --> 08:58.750
EVERYONE HAS A LIMIT,
AND I'VE REACHED MINE.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.333
I QUIT.

09:10.083 --> 09:10.583
OHH!

09:10.583 --> 09:13.417
OH, UH, UH...

09:13.417 --> 09:14.583
E.T.S.?

09:14.583 --> 09:16.875
STOP. DROP THAT FOLDER.

09:16.875 --> 09:18.166
BACK AWAY
FROM THE MATERIAL.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.208
YES, SIR.

09:20.208 --> 09:20.875
KEEP YOUR HANDS
IN PLAIN SIGHT.

09:22.708 --> 09:26.375
ARE YOU WITH
THE EDUCATIONAL
TESTING SERVICE?

09:26.375 --> 09:28.041
THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL.

09:28.041 --> 09:29.708
I JUST HOPE NOBODY
AT CAPESIDE HIGH

09:29.708 --> 09:31.041
HAS DONE ANYTHING WRONG,

09:31.041 --> 09:34.041
BROKEN ANY RULES, COMPROMISED
THE INTEGRITY OF THE EXAM.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.041
PASSING ALONG
THAT INFORMATION

09:35.041 --> 09:37.166
WOULD CONSTITUTE
A BREACH OF SECURITY.

09:37.166 --> 09:38.458
OF COURSE.

09:38.458 --> 09:39.792
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
PRINCIPAL GREEN IS?

09:39.792 --> 09:40.375
NO, SIR.

09:40.375 --> 09:42.667
BUT BEFORE YOU GO,

09:42.667 --> 09:46.708
LET ME EXPRESS MY REGRET
AND RECALCITRANCE
AT THIS INCIDENT.

09:46.708 --> 09:47.458
RECALCITRANCE?

09:47.458 --> 09:49.458
UM, I MEAN, REPENTANCE.

09:49.458 --> 09:52.917
REPENTANCE,
AS IN CONTRITION,

09:52.917 --> 09:55.875
COMPUNCTION, YOU KNOW,
CONTRITENESS.

09:56.917 --> 09:59.125
GOOD DAY, MA'AM.

09:59.125 --> 10:01.250
WATCH YOURSELF.

10:03.625 --> 10:04.959
[SIGH]

10:07.417 --> 10:08.625
THIS ISN'T
A SURPRISE, PACEY.

10:08.625 --> 10:11.500
IT'S A DEATH MARCH
ON A DESERTED ROAD.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.166
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

10:13.166 --> 10:15.041
WHY DIDN'T WE
JUST DRIVE?

10:15.041 --> 10:16.458
BECAUSE, POTTER,
ON OCCASION,

10:16.458 --> 10:18.500
MY FATHER ACTUALLY
LIKES TO USE HIS CAR.

10:18.500 --> 10:22.542
SO I RISK MY FUTURE
SO I CAN STAND IN LINE
AT THE POST OFFICE

10:22.542 --> 10:24.125
AND THEN TRAIPSE 5 MILES
THROUGH THE WILDERNESS

10:24.125 --> 10:25.417
CARRYING SOME
STUPID PACKAGE.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.625
[MOANS]

10:26.625 --> 10:28.166
YOU KNOW, DID YOU EVER
STOP TO THINK

10:28.166 --> 10:30.375
ABOUT HOW MUCH
HORMONALLY-CHARGED
ENERGY YOU WASTE

10:30.375 --> 10:32.625
ON THESE QUICK QUIPS
AND THE BITING BANTER?

10:32.625 --> 10:34.667
YOUR LIFE WOULD BE
CONSIDERABLY MORE PRODUCTIVE

10:34.667 --> 10:36.959
IF YOU WOULD JUST
TAKE SOME MORE, UH...

10:36.959 --> 10:41.166
OH! WHAT IS THAT?
SOME MORE...ACTION.

10:41.166 --> 10:42.250
IF YOU TOOK MORE ACTION.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.000
OH, LIKE VOLUNTARY
MANSLAUGHTER?

10:44.000 --> 10:47.291
WELL, HOW ABOUT LIKE
STICKING OUT YOUR THUMB, HUH?

10:47.291 --> 10:48.959
OH, YEAH?
WHAT ELSE?

10:48.959 --> 10:52.041
MAYBE HIKE UP MY SKIRT,
POUT MY LIPS,

10:52.041 --> 10:54.792
STRIKE SOME SEXY POSE
FOR A HORNDOG TRUCKER?

10:54.792 --> 10:56.792
STICK OUT YOUR OWN THUMB,
YOU SEXIST TOAD.

10:56.792 --> 10:58.667
I AM NOT A SEXIST.
I AM A PRAGMATIST, OK?

10:58.667 --> 11:01.208
YOU EVER SEEN
THE SURE THING?

11:01.208 --> 11:03.959
THAT FILM ELEGANTLY
PORTRAYS ONE OF LIFE'S
SIMPLE TRUTHS.

11:03.959 --> 11:06.458
THAT A FEMALE, STANDING
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,

11:06.458 --> 11:08.166
EVEN ONE WITH
A PERPETUAL SCOWL
SUCH AS YOURSELF,

11:08.166 --> 11:11.000
HAS A BETTER CHANCE
OF FLAGGING DOWN A CAR
THAN A GUY.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.250
SINCE I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE
WITH AN OPPOSABLE THUMB,

11:13.250 --> 11:14.417
I GUESS IT'S UP TO ME
TO USE IT.

11:14.417 --> 11:16.458
AND HERE'S YOUR CHANCE.

11:19.166 --> 11:21.375
UHH!

11:32.875 --> 11:33.834
HI.

11:36.667 --> 11:37.625
TODAY'S YOUR LUCKY DAY,
MISS POTTER.

11:37.625 --> 11:41.166
NEED A RIDE
BACK TO SCHOOL?

11:41.166 --> 11:43.959
THANKS.

11:43.959 --> 11:45.000
[RUSTLING BUSHES]

11:45.000 --> 11:46.166
OHH!

11:47.375 --> 11:50.417
OH! PRINCIPAL GREEN, HOO!

11:50.417 --> 11:52.583
THANK GOD YOU ARE HERE.

11:52.583 --> 11:54.000
IN PREPARING FOR
OUR BOTANY ASSIGNMENT,

11:54.000 --> 11:55.291
IT APPEARS THAT
JOSEPHINE AND I--

11:55.291 --> 11:56.583
WE WANDERED
SIGNIFICANTLY FARTHER
AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL

11:56.583 --> 11:58.542
THAN WE HAD
ANTICIPATED.

11:58.542 --> 12:00.542
FRANKLY, I WAS
BEGINNING TO WORRY

12:00.542 --> 12:02.375
THAT WE WEREN'T GOING
TO MAKE IT HOME
BY NIGHTFALL.

12:02.375 --> 12:04.917
[LAUGHING]

12:04.917 --> 12:06.333
THAT'S A GOOD ONE,
PACEY.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.083
HEH HEH.

12:08.083 --> 12:10.041
WELL, YOU KNOW,
LET IT NEVER BE SAID

12:10.041 --> 12:11.667
THAT I'M LACKING
IN THE CREATIVITY DEPARTMENT.

12:11.667 --> 12:12.667
LET'S HOPE
YOU'RE NOT LACKING

12:12.667 --> 12:14.625
IN THE CALAMINE LOTION
DEPARTMENT EITHER.

12:14.625 --> 12:16.875
NOW, PUT DOWN
THE POISON OAK

12:16.875 --> 12:18.458
AND GET YOUR BUTTS
IN MY CAR.

12:18.458 --> 12:22.000
HEH, AH,
AFTER YOU, JOSEPHINE.

12:26.041 --> 12:28.625
ALL RIGHT, DAD.

12:30.917 --> 12:31.959
DAD.

12:31.959 --> 12:32.875
HUH?

12:32.875 --> 12:33.834
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY.

12:33.834 --> 12:34.917
I JUST NEED 10 MINUTES
OF YOUR TIME.

12:34.917 --> 12:35.917
I'LL BE OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

12:35.917 --> 12:38.083
CAN'T IT JUST WAIT
TILL AFTER THE GAME?

12:38.083 --> 12:40.875
I PROMISE I'LL HAVE
PLENTY OF TIME FOR YA
AFTER SATURDAY.

12:40.875 --> 12:42.917
DAD, I GOT TO FED-EX
THIS THING OUT.

12:42.917 --> 12:44.542
FED-EX?

12:44.542 --> 12:45.750
TO MOM AT THE STATION.

12:45.750 --> 12:49.000
STATION?

12:49.000 --> 12:49.792
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

12:49.792 --> 12:52.583
THE STORY
I'M DOING ON JACK.

12:52.583 --> 12:55.417
YOUR MOTHER WANTS TO DO
A STORY ON JACK?

12:55.417 --> 12:56.667
I WANT TO DO A STORY ON JACK.
I AM DOING A STORY ON JACK.

12:56.667 --> 12:59.333
THIS IS GONNA GO
ON TELEVISION?

12:59.333 --> 13:00.542
WHEN?

13:00.542 --> 13:02.542
HOPEFULLY TOMORROW.
DAD, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

13:02.542 --> 13:03.583
I THOUGHT THIS WAS ONE
OF YOUR SCHOOL PROJECTS.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.625
IT IS A PROJECT.

13:05.625 --> 13:06.708
DAD, REMEMBER LAST NIGHT
IN YOUR KITCHEN

13:06.708 --> 13:08.583
THE BLOND-HAIRED KID
WHO WAS MOVING HIS LIPS?

13:08.583 --> 13:10.083
THAT WAS ACTUALLY ME
TELLING YOU THIS.

13:10.083 --> 13:13.667
DAWSON,
THIS IS THE LAST THING
THAT I NEED RIGHT NOW.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.000
OH, WHY IS THAT?

13:15.000 --> 13:16.583
BECAUSE FOOTBALL
IS A HEAD GAME,

13:16.583 --> 13:19.000
AND I CAN'T RISK
MY BEST PLAYER
OR ANY PLAYER

13:19.000 --> 13:20.041
FOR THAT MATTER,
LOSING FOCUS.

13:20.041 --> 13:21.625
I'VE WORKED
TOO DAMN HARD.

13:21.625 --> 13:23.917
FORGIVE ME
IF MY ENTIRE FUTURE

13:23.917 --> 13:25.750
CONFLICTS WITH YOUR
PRECIOUS FOOTBALL TEAM.

13:25.750 --> 13:28.250
AW, DON'T BE
SO THEATRICAL.

13:28.250 --> 13:30.542
I'M THE ONE WITH
THE FOOTBALL-LOVING
PRINCIPAL

13:30.542 --> 13:33.250
BREATHING DOWN MY NECK.
I AM TRYING TO BUILD
SOMETHING HERE.

13:33.250 --> 13:35.125
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'M DOING,

13:35.125 --> 13:37.542
DABBLING IN A HOBBY?

13:37.542 --> 13:39.000
THAT'S THE KIND
OF OPPORTUNITY

13:39.000 --> 13:40.750
I'VE WAITED FOR
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

13:40.750 --> 13:44.291
ALL 16 YEARS OF IT?

13:44.291 --> 13:44.959
OH, SO, THE IMPORTANCE
OF A PERSON'S DREAMS

13:44.959 --> 13:47.000
IS MEASURED BY THEIR AGE?

13:47.000 --> 13:51.792
THERE WILL BE PLENTY
OF OTHER OPPORTUNITIES,
BELIEVE ME.

13:52.917 --> 13:54.875
ARE YOU TELLING ME
NOT TO DO THIS?

13:54.875 --> 13:57.542
I DON'T HAVE TO.

13:57.542 --> 14:00.625
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'LL
MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE.

14:27.166 --> 14:27.500
HEY.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.500
HEY.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.917
YOU MUST BE LOST.
BIMBO COVE IS UP THE CREEK,

14:32.917 --> 14:35.417
RIGHT PAST
BRAINLESS BAY.

14:35.417 --> 14:36.375
YOU CAN SAVE
YOUR AMMUNITION, JOEY.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.875
EVE AND I AREN'T
ON SPEAKING TERMS.

14:37.875 --> 14:39.750
YOU MEAN, YOU GUYS
ACTUALLY TALKED?

14:39.750 --> 14:42.083
AMONG OTHER THINGS, YES.

14:42.708 --> 14:44.917
I NEED SOME ADVICE.

14:45.959 --> 14:49.875
WHAT ELSE ARE DUMPED
EX-GIRLFRIENDS FOR?

14:49.875 --> 14:52.000
IT'S ABOUT MY FATHER.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.625
YOUR FATHER?
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

14:53.625 --> 14:56.875
HE TOLD ME NOT TO DO
THE STORY ON JACK AND
THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

14:56.875 --> 14:58.083
HE DID?

14:58.083 --> 15:00.375
WELL, NOT IN SO MANY WORDS.

15:00.375 --> 15:02.375
HE THINKS IT MIGHT
JEOPARDIZE HIS CAREER.

15:02.375 --> 15:05.250
HIS CHANCES
AGAINST WOODWARD.

15:05.250 --> 15:09.917
NO OFFENSE, DAWSON,
BUT DOESN'T A NATIONALLY
TELEVISED BROADCAST

15:09.917 --> 15:11.875
KIND OF OVERSHADOW
A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL
RIVALRY?

15:11.875 --> 15:14.208
YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT.
I DON'T KNOW.

15:14.208 --> 15:15.792
I MEAN, LOOK AT IT FROM
HIS POINT OF VIEW,
YOU KNOW?

15:15.792 --> 15:18.333
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS
HIS CUP HASN'T EXACTLY
RUNNETH OVER.

15:18.333 --> 15:21.417
HE HAD TO
GIVE UP HIS DREAM OF
A RESTAURANT IDEA,

15:21.417 --> 15:24.750
HIS WIFE STEPPED OUT ON HIM
WITH THE CAPESIDE EQUIVALENT
OF TED KNIGHT,

15:24.750 --> 15:28.041
AND HE'S NOT EXACTLY SHINING
AS A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER.

15:28.041 --> 15:30.500
SO IF YOU GO AHEAD
WITH THE STORY,

15:30.500 --> 15:31.917
HE COULD LOSE
MORE THAN THE GAME.

15:31.917 --> 15:34.041
HE COULD LOSE
HIS SELF-RESPECT.

15:34.041 --> 15:36.000
YEAH.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.458
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15:37.458 --> 15:42.250
WELL, I THINK THAT
THE SWORDS THAT ARE
THE FATHER AND SON

15:42.250 --> 15:43.875
HAVE FINALLY
CROSSED IN CONFLICT.

15:43.875 --> 15:47.083
I MEAN, FACE IT, DAWSON,
THIS IS THE STUFF
OF GREEK DRAMA.

15:47.083 --> 15:51.041
YEAH, BUT IS THIS
TRAGEDY OR COMEDY?

15:51.041 --> 15:53.708
SOMETIMES
WE FIGHT OUR FATHERS,
AND THEY RESPECT US

15:53.708 --> 15:57.291
AND...SOMETIMES...

15:57.291 --> 16:03.208
WE FIGHT THEM AND...
WE LOSE THEM FOREVER.

16:05.208 --> 16:09.125
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE
HOW YOU WANT TO LIVE
YOUR LIFE.

16:09.125 --> 16:11.041
YOU KNOW? WHAT YOU
CAN TOLERATE AND...

16:11.041 --> 16:14.583
AND WHAT YOU'RE
WILLING TO LOSE.

16:16.917 --> 16:18.125
OH, GOD, THIS IS
SO IMPORTANT TO ME,

16:18.125 --> 16:20.250
BUT IF I DO IT,
IT'S GONNA KILL HIM.

16:22.041 --> 16:23.917
WELL...

16:23.917 --> 16:25.333
I HATE TO BREAK IT
TO YA, DAWSON,

16:25.333 --> 16:26.792
BUT ACCORDING TO FREUD,

16:26.792 --> 16:29.125
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
SONS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.

16:35.792 --> 16:36.625
I DUBBED THIS FOR YA.

16:36.625 --> 16:38.959
WHAT'S THIS?

16:38.959 --> 16:42.166
HEH. SOMETHING I FOUND.

16:42.166 --> 16:43.333
MADE ME SMILE.

16:44.375 --> 16:47.208
I GUESS, NOW, YOU COULD
CALL IT A THANK YOU.

16:51.583 --> 16:52.792
[SIGH]

16:55.000 --> 16:57.708
IT MUST BE
DRIED SALIVA.

16:57.708 --> 17:00.667
NO, IT'S A ZIPPER MARK
FROM THE PILLOW.

17:00.667 --> 17:05.416
YES, THAT BRIGHT SENSATION
IN YOUR EYES IS,
INDEED, SUNLIGHT.

17:05.416 --> 17:07.458
RISE AND SHINE,
DEAR GIRL.

17:07.458 --> 17:09.458
THESE LOVELY YOUNG LADIES
HAVE AN URGENT MATTER
TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.

17:09.458 --> 17:12.500
I TOLD YOU THAT I WAS
FINISHED WITH CHEERLEADING.

17:12.500 --> 17:16.165
AND UNLESS ONE OF YOU
IS HIDING A VERY LARGE
CUP OF BLACK COFFEE

17:16.165 --> 17:19.541
UNDER HER POMPOMS,
I SUGGEST YOU LEAVE.

17:19.541 --> 17:20.875
OH, NO, WE RESPECT
YOUR DECISION

17:20.875 --> 17:22.583
TO RESIGN FROM
THE SQUAD,

17:22.583 --> 17:24.708
MADISON HAS ACCEPTED
THE LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE.

17:24.708 --> 17:27.875
BUT PLEASE, YOU MUST
RECONSIDER THE KISS.

17:27.875 --> 17:30.375
SOMEONE HAS
BID $500.

17:30.375 --> 17:33.208
BUT THEY'VE SPECIFICALLY
STIPULATED THAT THE KISS
MUST COME FROM YOU.

17:33.208 --> 17:34.834
I DON'T CARE IF THEY BID
THE KINGDOM OF BRUNEI,

17:34.834 --> 17:37.208
I'M NOT FOR SALE.

17:37.208 --> 17:40.875
WHAT ARE WE GONNA TELL
THE CHILDREN OF
THE CCHPC?

17:40.875 --> 17:42.542
THE WHAT?

17:42.542 --> 17:47.250
THE CAPESIDE COUNTY HOME
FOR PARENTLESS CHILDREN.

17:47.250 --> 17:49.125
ORPHANS? THAT--

17:49.125 --> 17:51.583
THAT'S WHAT
THE AUCTION IS FOR?

17:51.583 --> 17:53.750
ORPHANS?

17:53.750 --> 17:56.000
OHH...

18:05.750 --> 18:07.083
UH, MISS McPHEE.

18:07.083 --> 18:08.333
BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU.

18:08.333 --> 18:09.417
PRINCIPAL GREEN.

18:09.417 --> 18:11.333
YES, LISTEN, UH,
A CRITICAL PROBLEM

18:11.333 --> 18:12.375
HAS BEEN BROUGHT
TO MY ATTENTION,

18:12.375 --> 18:14.625
AND I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT IT.

18:14.625 --> 18:16.083
WHAT SORT
OF PROBLEM, SIR?

18:16.083 --> 18:18.250
IT'S
A DISCIPLINARY MATTER.

18:18.250 --> 18:19.625
DISCIPLINARY?

18:19.625 --> 18:22.542
YES. NOW, I'M
UNABLE TO DISCUSS IT
WITH YOU AT LENGTH NOW,

18:22.542 --> 18:24.083
BUT IF YOU COME
TO MY OFFICE MONDAY,

18:24.083 --> 18:27.542
WE'LL SIT DOWN AND
GO OVER ALL OF OUR
OPTIONS IN DETAIL.

18:28.542 --> 18:29.291
OPTIONS...YES, SIR.

18:29.291 --> 18:33.041
MONDAY MORNING.
BE THERE.

18:38.750 --> 18:43.417
SO, SINCE MR. WITTER'S
ATTEMPT AT LYING TO ME
WAS SO CREATIVE,

18:43.417 --> 18:46.542
I'VE COME UP WITH
A LITTLE CREATIVE
RESPONSE IN KIND.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.959
WELL, COMING FROM
A JUST-MINDED SOUL
SUCH AS YOURSELF,

18:48.959 --> 18:51.125
I'M SURE YOUR PUNISHMENT
WILL BE NOTHING
BUT FAIR, SIR.

18:51.125 --> 18:53.208
OH, THANK YOU,
EDDIE HASKELL.

18:53.208 --> 18:55.250
WHERE IS YOUR
SCHOOL SPIRIT, JOSEPHINE?

18:55.250 --> 18:56.125
I THINK I LEFT IT
COWERING IN THE BUSHES.

18:56.125 --> 18:58.625
NOW THAT IS
A GROSS MISCONCEPTION.

18:58.625 --> 19:01.458
I HURLED MYSELF UPON
THE FLAMES OF RESPONSIBILITY.

19:01.458 --> 19:03.792
I HOPE A DEER TICK
CRAWLED IN YOUR EAR
AND LAID EGGS.

19:03.792 --> 19:05.625
ENOUGH!

19:05.625 --> 19:07.375
HONESTLY.

19:07.375 --> 19:09.625
I AM NOT SURE HOW TO GET
THROUGH TO THE TWO OF YOU,

19:09.625 --> 19:12.417
BUT SINCE YOU OBVIOUSLY
HAVE AN AFFINITY
FOR ONE ANOTHER,

19:12.417 --> 19:14.792
HERE'S WHAT
I HAVE IN MIND.

19:15.792 --> 19:16.959
NO WAY.

19:16.959 --> 19:18.291
OH, THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.

19:18.291 --> 19:21.583
OH, I'M GLAD TO SEE
WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT HERE.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.500
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE CAUGHT THE THING.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.500
IT WAS WAY
OVER HIS HEAD.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.542
HEY!

19:29.542 --> 19:30.875
HEY.

19:30.875 --> 19:32.041
WHAT'S WRONG?

19:32.041 --> 19:34.458
NOTHING'S WRONG.
WHY SHOULD ANYTHING
BE WRONG?

19:34.458 --> 19:37.458
BECAUSE YOU'RE SITTING
IN A STAIRWELL OF
A PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL.

19:37.458 --> 19:40.000
UNLESS YOU'RE SMOKING
OR MAKING OUT,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.625
IT'S CAUSE FOR CONCERN.

19:42.625 --> 19:43.875
COME ON,
I'M GOING TO MEET DAWSON.

19:43.875 --> 19:45.750
WE'RE GONNA CHECK OUT
THE FOOTAGE FROM
MY INTERVIEW.

19:45.750 --> 19:46.625
YOU WENT
THROUGH WITH IT?

19:46.625 --> 19:48.333
YEAH. IT WAS COOL.
IT WENT GREAT.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.500
WELL, IT MAY SEEM
THAT WAY TODAY,

19:50.500 --> 19:52.708
BUT ANYTHING COULD
HAPPEN TOMORROW TO ROCK
YOUR SAFE LITTLE WORLD.

19:52.708 --> 19:53.875
WHAT?!

19:53.875 --> 19:55.250
JACK, MAYBE YOU
OVERLOOKED SOMETHING.

19:55.250 --> 19:58.208
MAYBE--MAYBE YOU DIDN'T
SEE EVERY ANGLE.

19:58.208 --> 20:00.583
MAYBE YOU HAD A TERRIBLE
MOMENT OF WEAKNESS.

20:00.583 --> 20:01.500
MAYBE WITHOUT EVEN
REALIZING IT,

20:01.500 --> 20:04.417
YOU TOTALLY,
IRREVERSIBLY SCREWED UP.

20:04.417 --> 20:07.333
ANDIE, IT'S NOT
THAT BIG A DEAL.
WHY BE SO PARANOID?

20:07.333 --> 20:09.083
LOOK, JACK,
YOU COULD LIVE
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE

20:09.083 --> 20:13.542
ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW
DRIVING TOWARDS SOMETHING
YOU BELIEVE IN, THEN WHAT?

20:13.542 --> 20:18.125
ONE TINY LITTLE MISTAKE,
ONE LITTLE ERROR IN JUDGMENT,

20:18.125 --> 20:20.208
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
YOUR CAR'S ON THE SIDE
OF THE ROAD,

20:20.208 --> 20:22.208
FLIPPED OVER,
WHEELS STILL SPINNING,
AND THE RADIO ON.

20:22.208 --> 20:23.542
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:23.542 --> 20:25.208
I'M TALKING ABOUT
BEING PUBLICLY SHAMED,

20:25.208 --> 20:27.708
EXPOSED FOR WHAT
YOU REALLY ARE.

20:27.708 --> 20:29.417
I'M TALKING ABOUT
A LIFE BEING RUINED,

20:29.417 --> 20:30.750
CUT SHORT,
NIPPED IN THE BUTT,

20:30.750 --> 20:32.083
I'M TALKING ABOUT
BREAKING DAD'S HEART.

20:32.083 --> 20:33.583
DAD?

20:33.583 --> 20:35.041
THINK ABOUT HOW
HE'S GONNA FEEL, JACK,

20:35.041 --> 20:37.250
HIS DISAPPOINTMENT,
HIS HUMILIATION.

20:37.250 --> 20:39.417
WE ARE HIS
PRIDE AND JOY, JACK.

20:39.417 --> 20:41.333
THINK ABOUT HOW HARD
HE'S WORKED FOR US
OVER THE YEARS,

20:41.333 --> 20:42.250
HOW MUCH HE SACRIFICED.
AND NOW THIS,

20:42.250 --> 20:44.041
OUT IN THE OPEN
FOR EVERYONE TO SEE.

20:44.041 --> 20:46.208
JUST CALM DOWN,
ALL RIGHT?

20:46.208 --> 20:47.375
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M STILL IN THE CLOSET.

20:47.375 --> 20:48.583
DAD ALREADY KNOWS
I'M GAY.

20:48.583 --> 20:52.917
I KNOW--
YEAH, I KNOW. I KNOW.

20:52.917 --> 20:54.792
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE CAREFUL, JACK.

20:54.792 --> 20:57.750
EVERY ACTION
HAS A CONSEQUENCE.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.458
BE SURE YOU THINK
THIS THING THROUGH.

21:03.750 --> 21:06.458
NO ONE REALLY SEEMS TO CARE
WHAT I MAY OR MAY NOT DO
OFF THE FIELD.

21:06.458 --> 21:09.917
SO YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM
PLAYING AGAINST SOMEONE
WHO'S OPENLY GAY?

21:09.917 --> 21:12.583
IF A KID WANTS TO COME OUT
WEARING LIPSTICK AND ROUGE,

21:12.583 --> 21:15.583
WE'RE GONNA INFRINGE ON HIM
THE WAY WE INFRINGE ON
ANYBODY ELSE.

21:15.583 --> 21:16.667
NO DIFFERENCE.

21:19.542 --> 21:21.166
WELL...

21:24.250 --> 21:27.625
I JUST LOST
THE FIRST GAME OF
MY COACHING CAREER.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.250
IF YOU SAY SO.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.708
DAWSON, THAT JUST
WENT OUT TO
3 MILLION PEOPLE.

21:34.708 --> 21:40.792
NOT TO MENTION
YOU INTERVIEWED
THE OPPOSING COACH.

21:40.792 --> 21:41.834
SO?

21:41.834 --> 21:43.333
SO?

21:43.333 --> 21:45.792
SO 2 DAYS AGO,
NOBODY KNEW HOW
GOOD JACK WAS

21:45.792 --> 21:46.542
OR WHO HE IS.

21:46.542 --> 21:49.458
NOW THE WHOLE WORLD
KNOWS.

21:49.458 --> 21:51.458
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
HAVE GONE OUT

21:51.458 --> 21:53.750
AND PAINTED
A BULL'S-EYE
ON HIS BACK.

21:53.750 --> 21:55.667
YOU NEVER EXPLAINED
THAT TO ME, DAD.

21:55.667 --> 21:58.125
I DIDN'T THINK I HAD TO.
IT'S PRETTY DAMN
OBVIOUS!

21:58.125 --> 21:59.625
NOT TO ME IT ISN'T!

21:59.625 --> 22:01.792
INSTEAD OF CELEBRATING
MY FIRST PROFESSIONAL
SUCCESS IN THE WORLD,

22:01.792 --> 22:03.959
WE'RE SITTING HERE
WORRYING ABOUT
A FOOTBALL GAME.

22:03.959 --> 22:07.625
HEY, DON'T MAKE ME OUT
TO BE THE BAD GUY HERE,
DAWSON.

22:07.625 --> 22:09.708
YES, I'M ANGRY,
JUST LIKE YOU KNEW
I WOULD BE.

22:09.708 --> 22:12.917
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A TEAM
THAT HASN'T PUT A NOTCH
IN THE WIN COLUMN IN 3 YEARS.

22:12.917 --> 22:15.125
NOW WHAT ARE WE SAYING,
THAT I'M WASTING
MY TIME?

22:15.125 --> 22:17.542
NO, BUT I WANT YOU
TO HAVE SOME PERSPECTIVE.

22:17.542 --> 22:19.375
I CAN'T EVEN DISCUSS THIS
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

22:19.375 --> 22:21.250
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT!

22:21.250 --> 22:22.542
THANKS TO YOU,
I DON'T.

22:22.542 --> 22:25.250
EVER SINCE YOU
TOOK THIS JOB, YOU
HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO ME.

22:25.250 --> 22:26.417
I TALK TO YOU.

22:26.417 --> 22:28.458
NOT THE WAY YOU
TALK TO THE GUYS
ON YOUR TEAM.

22:28.458 --> 22:30.792
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY RESPECT ME.

22:30.792 --> 22:32.333
I RESPECT YOU, DAD.

22:32.333 --> 22:35.917
IT'S JUST THEY'RE
MORE THE KIND OF SON
YOU WISH YOU'D HAD.

22:35.917 --> 22:37.208
THAT IS NOT  TRUE.

22:37.208 --> 22:40.000
DAWSON, I HUM THE THEME
FROM CLOSE ENCOUNTERS

22:40.000 --> 22:42.500
IN MY SLEEP!

22:42.500 --> 22:43.834
I REACH OUT TO YOU!

22:43.834 --> 22:46.041
AND WHEN WE CAN'T
FIND COMMON GROUND,

22:46.041 --> 22:47.166
I GIVE YOU
YOUR SPACE.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.875
AND WHEN I TAKE IT,
YOU GET PISSED OFF
AT ME.

22:48.875 --> 22:52.792
NO. I'M JUST TRYING
TO BREAK YOU OUT OF
YOUR SELF-CENTERED,

22:52.792 --> 22:55.417
SELF-RIGHTEOUS FANTASY WORLD
LONG ENOUGH TO LOOK OUT FOR
OTHER PEOPLE.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.834
SINCE WHEN IS IT
MY  RESPONSIBILITY
TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU?

22:57.834 --> 22:59.708
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

22:59.708 --> 23:01.625
I'M SAYING I PARENT YOU,
DAD. I WALK IN ON YOU
HAVING SEX.

23:01.625 --> 23:04.417
I GIVE YOU  ADVICE.
I'M THE KID AROUND HERE!

23:04.417 --> 23:06.708
SOMETIMES I MIGHT EVEN
ACT LIKE IT!

23:20.375 --> 23:23.959
[CROWD, CHANTING]
DEFENSE! WHOO WHOO! DEFENSE!

23:29.000 --> 23:30.583
COME ON,
LET'S HIT HIM!
HIT HIM! HIT HIM!

23:49.375 --> 23:52.500
GO BACK TO TETHERBALL,
YOU LIMP-WRISTED HOMO!

23:52.500 --> 23:53.542
THIS IS GETTING
UGLY.

23:53.542 --> 23:56.583
CRACKBACK, DAMN IT!
CRACKBACK, CRACKBACK!

23:56.583 --> 24:00.041
RIGHT GUARD BLOCKS DOWN.
LITVACK TAKES OUT THE END!

24:03.708 --> 24:05.417
THEY'RE KEYING ON JACK.
HE'S GETTING KILLED
OUT THERE.

24:05.417 --> 24:07.750
AND OUR RUNNING GAME'S
DOA.

24:07.750 --> 24:10.750
WALK IT OFF, McPHEE!
[CLAPS] GOOD MAN!
WALK IT OFF!

24:10.750 --> 24:14.208
WALK IT OFF.
CAN'T WALK IT OFF.
YOU WALK IT OFF.

24:14.208 --> 24:15.125
YOU ALL RIGHT?
HUDDLE UP!

24:15.125 --> 24:17.291
LET'S GO!

24:19.000 --> 24:21.458
SO TELL ME THE TRUTH.
IS THIS ALL MY FAULT?

24:21.458 --> 24:23.792
IN A WORD...

24:23.792 --> 24:25.000
YES.

24:26.291 --> 24:28.291
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT
SIDE, DAWSON.

24:28.291 --> 24:30.375
AT LEAST WHEN THIS
IS ALL OVER,
WIN OR LOSE,

24:30.375 --> 24:31.542
YOU WON'T BE ON
THE 50-YARD LINE

24:31.542 --> 24:34.458
PUCKERING YOUR LIPS
FOR SOME SPOILED BRAT

24:34.458 --> 24:36.542
WITH FURRY TEETH
AND HALITOSIS.

24:38.041 --> 24:40.000
JUST THINK OF IT
AS METHOD ACTING.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.959
THINK OF IT AS
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

24:41.959 --> 24:43.375
I'LL FLIP YOU FOR IT.
NOT A CHANCE!

24:43.375 --> 24:44.917
DIE DIE BO?
FORGET IT.

24:44.917 --> 24:47.625
FINE. I'LL JUST CUT TO THE CHASE
AND BEG YOU--PLEASE, JOEY!

24:47.625 --> 24:48.792
PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE!

24:48.792 --> 24:50.667
DON'T MAKE ME
GO OUT THERE.

24:50.667 --> 24:53.708
LOOK, I'M SUPPOSED TO
BE AT WORK RIGHT NOW
MAKING MUCH-NEEDED MONEY,

24:53.708 --> 24:56.291
BUT INSTEAD, BECAUSE OF YOU,
I'M STANDING ON A FOOTBALL FIELD

24:56.291 --> 24:58.333
FIGHTING OVER
THE REAR END OF A MULE.

24:58.333 --> 25:00.125
FINE. FINE. I WAS
JUST GIVING YOU
FAIR WARNING.

25:00.125 --> 25:02.500
WHAT?

25:02.500 --> 25:05.500
I TEND TO GET
A LITTLE CARSICK
IN BACKSEATS.

25:14.792 --> 25:16.542
PRINCIPAL GREEN?

25:16.542 --> 25:18.083
I MADE A MISTAKE.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.917
WELL...A TERRIBLE ERROR
IN JUDGMENT, REALLY.

25:19.917 --> 25:22.917
I KNOW THAT THERE'S
NO EXCUSE FOR WHAT I'VE DONE,

25:22.917 --> 25:27.000
SO I WON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,
BUT THERE IS AN EXPLANATION,

25:27.000 --> 25:31.041
ONE THAT I CAN ONLY PRAY
YOU'LL FIND IN YOUR HEART
TO UNDERSTAND.

25:31.041 --> 25:32.583
SEE, THERE'S THIS GUY...

25:32.583 --> 25:36.166
AND WHEN I MET HIM,
IT WAS LIKE...

25:36.166 --> 25:38.208
LIKE A SHADE GOING UP
IN A DARK ROOM,

25:38.208 --> 25:40.834
LIGHT SUDDENLY POURING IN.

25:40.834 --> 25:43.834
HE UNDERSTOOD ME IN A WAY
THAT NO ONE EVER DID
OR COULD.

25:43.834 --> 25:49.166
AND THEN, JUST AS SUDDENLY,
THE ROOM GOT DARK AGAIN.

25:49.166 --> 25:51.125
IN MY MIND, I MEAN.

25:51.125 --> 25:53.708
SEE...

25:53.708 --> 25:56.542
OVER THE SUMMER...

25:56.542 --> 26:00.375
I WAS TREATED
AT A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL.

26:00.375 --> 26:05.041
I DIDN'T HAVE TO STAY LONG,
BECAUSE I GOT BETTER.

26:05.041 --> 26:08.041
BUT WHEN I CAME BACK,

26:08.041 --> 26:10.875
I HAD LOST THE GUY.

26:10.875 --> 26:13.542
HE WAS...MY SOULMATE.

26:13.542 --> 26:16.041
IT WAS LIKE HAVING...

26:16.041 --> 26:21.917
AN ORGAN, MY HEART,
LITERALLY RIPPED FROM MY BODY.

26:21.917 --> 26:25.083
AND ALL I COULD FEEL
WAS COLD AND EMPTY,

26:25.083 --> 26:27.500
MY FUTURE SLIPPING AWAY.

26:27.500 --> 26:30.417
AND I HAD
LOST THE LOVE...

26:30.417 --> 26:33.291
SO I WAS DETERMINED
NOT TO LOSE MY LIFE,

26:33.291 --> 26:35.583
AND THAT'S WHY...

26:35.583 --> 26:38.291
I STOLE THE TEST,
AND THAT'S WHY I CHEATED.

26:38.291 --> 26:42.625
BECAUSE I WANTED TO TRY
TO KEEP IT FROM ALL
GETTING AWAY FROM ME,

26:42.625 --> 26:46.041
AND...I KNOW THAT
I ONLY MADE THINGS WORSE.

26:48.083 --> 26:50.333
SO...

26:50.333 --> 26:52.917
NOW ALL I CAN ASK FOR
IS YOUR COMPASSION.

27:12.375 --> 27:13.792
LET'S GO.

27:13.792 --> 27:15.291
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

27:15.291 --> 27:16.834
TO EVEN THE SCORE.

27:18.667 --> 27:20.250
COME ON, GUYS.

27:20.250 --> 27:21.458
YOU CAN'T LET 'EM GET TO YA!

27:21.458 --> 27:22.667
THEY ARE PSYCHING YOU OUT!

27:22.667 --> 27:24.041
TAKING US OUT OF OUR GAME PLAN.

27:24.041 --> 27:26.250
THE TRUTH IS,
WE'RE NOT MOVING THE BALL.

27:26.250 --> 27:27.083
WE'RE NOT FIRING OUT
ON DEFENSE!

27:27.083 --> 27:29.458
SUCK IN THAT GUT
AND GO HARDER.

27:29.458 --> 27:31.625
A LONG TIME AGO...

27:31.625 --> 27:34.125
THERE WAS A CHINESE
WARRIOR-PHILOSOPHER.

27:34.125 --> 27:36.166
GENERAL SUN-TZU.

27:36.166 --> 27:40.083
BRILLIANT MILITARY STRATEGIST
WHO LIVED ABOUT 2,000 YEARS AGO.

27:42.041 --> 27:45.125
MY DAD HAS BEEN TELLING ME
ABOUT HIM EVER SINCE
I WAS A KID.

27:46.417 --> 27:48.041
WHAT'S WITH
THE BUCKET?

27:48.041 --> 27:51.500
WE'RE GONNA TURN
OUR WEAKNESS INTO A STRENGTH,
JUST LIKE THE GENERAL SAID.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.583
WE'RE GONNA START BY
OBSCURING EVERYONE'S NUMBER

27:53.583 --> 27:55.500
SO THE OTHER TEAM
CAN'T FIND JACK.

27:55.500 --> 27:56.750
THAT MIGHT WORK
FOR A COUPLE OF PLAYS.

27:56.750 --> 27:58.291
THAT'S WHY
IT'S ONLY PHASE ONE.

27:58.291 --> 27:59.834
SO WHAT'S PHASE 2?

28:03.708 --> 28:05.708
JEN.

28:17.917 --> 28:19.375
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET UP THERE,

28:19.375 --> 28:21.667
GET UP THERE AND HIT
SOMEBODY NOW! HIT SOMEBODY!

28:21.667 --> 28:22.458
HERE WE GO.

28:22.458 --> 28:24.500
CROSS YOUR FINGERS.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.917
READY?
BREAK!

28:35.375 --> 28:37.208
HEY, COACH, WHAT'S THIS?

28:44.625 --> 28:47.208
Henry: 42, BLUE TURK RIGHT.

28:47.208 --> 28:48.959
DOUBLE SLOT.

28:50.750 --> 28:53.750
TRY AND FIND THE HOMO NOW!

28:55.083 --> 28:56.250
SET!

28:56.250 --> 28:57.625
HIKE!

29:03.291 --> 29:06.375
Announcer: 21-4!
WITH 7 SECONDS LEFT,

29:06.375 --> 29:08.041
THE MINUTEMEN
HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE.

29:08.041 --> 29:09.542
Henry: CAN YOU GET
A STEP ON HIM, JACK?

29:09.542 --> 29:11.500
ONE MORE TIME.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

29:11.500 --> 29:12.917
I THINK MY MASCARA'S
RUNNING.

29:12.917 --> 29:13.917
[CHUCKLING]

29:13.917 --> 29:15.875
JUST THROW ME THE BALL.
I'LL CATCH IT.

29:15.875 --> 29:17.250
CONSIDER IT DONE.

29:17.250 --> 29:19.291
ALL RIGHT, CRADLE OUT.
DRILL-9 SHIVER.

29:19.291 --> 29:20.708
BROADSIDE OPTION,
FLOW-AND-GO.

29:20.708 --> 29:22.583
ON 2. READY?
BREAK!

29:22.583 --> 29:26.625
Announcer:
IT'S 4TH IN 14. THE BALL'S
SITTING ON THE 25-YARD LINE.

29:47.375 --> 29:48.917
HIT HIM! HIT HIM!

29:53.917 --> 29:56.125
TOUCHDOWN!
IT'S A TOUCHDOWN!

29:56.125 --> 29:58.708
CAPESIDE WINS!
CAPESIDE WINS!

30:01.625 --> 30:04.291
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE COMEBACK.

30:04.291 --> 30:06.667
AFTER A LONG, DRY SPELL,
CAPESIDE IS VICTORIOUS.

30:06.667 --> 30:13.792
FINAL SCORE: CAPESIDE 27-24.

30:13.792 --> 30:14.917
OUTSTANDING!

30:14.917 --> 30:16.333
OUTSTANDING!

30:16.333 --> 30:17.959
MITCH!

30:17.959 --> 30:19.041
YES, SIR.

30:19.041 --> 30:21.000
THAT WAS ONE OF
THE MOST IRREVERENT

30:21.000 --> 30:23.625
AND IMAGINATIVE
GAME PLANS I'VE EVER SEEN.

30:23.625 --> 30:25.875
CONGRATULATIONS, COACH!

30:25.875 --> 30:26.375
THANK YOU.
THAT'S GREA--

30:26.375 --> 30:28.417
AAH!

30:30.417 --> 30:33.333
ONE GOOD DEED DOWN,
ONE TO GO.

30:33.333 --> 30:36.542
JENNIFER LINDLEY,
ONCE AGAIN A VICTIM
OF HER OWN BIG HEART.

30:36.542 --> 30:37.417
DON'T PUSH IT, BUDDY.

30:37.417 --> 30:39.625
[GROANS] UHH...

30:39.625 --> 30:42.000
PRINCIPAL GREEN,
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU!

30:42.000 --> 30:43.041
NOT RIGHT NOW,
ANDIE.

30:43.041 --> 30:44.750
NO, SIR, IT'S IMPORTANT.
IT CANNOT WAIT.

30:44.750 --> 30:45.542
WE NEED TO
CLEAR THIS UP.

30:45.542 --> 30:47.917
OK, WHAT IS IT?

30:47.917 --> 30:52.166
WELL, I MADE A MISTAKE.
WELL, A TERRIBLE ERROR
IN JUDGMENT REALLY.

30:52.166 --> 30:53.375
WHAT KIND OF MISTAKE?

30:53.375 --> 30:56.166
WELL, I KNOW THERE'S
NO EXCUSE FOR WHAT
I'VE DONE--

30:56.166 --> 30:57.750
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, ANDIE?

30:57.750 --> 31:00.250
DIDN'T YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME?

31:00.250 --> 31:03.792
THAT WAS MONDAY.
I WAS GONNA DISCUSS IT
WITH YOU ON MONDAY.

31:03.792 --> 31:05.333
BUT IF YOU MUST
KNOW NOW,

31:05.333 --> 31:07.417
I'M FORMING A NEW
STUDENT DISCIPLINARY
COMMITTEE,

31:07.417 --> 31:08.834
AND I WANT YOU TO BE
IN CHARGE OF IT.

31:08.834 --> 31:10.959
OH! WELL...
I COULD DO THAT.

31:10.959 --> 31:14.166
I MEAN, I WOULD BE
HONORED TO DO THAT!

31:14.166 --> 31:17.625
OK. NOW, WHAT WAS
THIS MISTAKE YOU
WERE TALKING ABOUT?

31:18.500 --> 31:20.083
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
INTERRUPTED YOU.

31:20.083 --> 31:23.125
IT'S A MISTAKE
TO BE SO...IMPATIENT.

31:23.125 --> 31:25.375
BUT I'M WORKING ON IT,
SIR.

31:25.375 --> 31:26.708
[CHUCKLES]

31:26.708 --> 31:29.166
OK. I'LL TALK
TO YOU LATER.

31:29.166 --> 31:31.375
I'M WORKING ON IT.

31:31.375 --> 31:35.625
[CHEERING]

31:38.625 --> 31:42.458
ALL RIGHT! OK! OK!

31:42.458 --> 31:45.000
AND NOW,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

31:45.000 --> 31:49.041
THE MOMENT THAT YOU'VE
ALL BEEN WAITING FOR--

31:49.041 --> 31:51.542
THE WINNER
OF THE SILENT AUCTION

31:51.542 --> 31:54.667
WHO IS ENTITLED TO ONE RIDE
ON THE MINUTEMAN MULE

31:54.667 --> 31:58.625
AND ONE HEART-STOPPING KISS
FROM OUR HEAD CHEERLEADER.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.250
EX-HEAD CHEERLEADER.

32:00.250 --> 32:01.542
AND HERE HE IS!

32:17.417 --> 32:18.750
HENRY?

32:21.500 --> 32:24.458
HOW THE HELL DID YOU
GET $500?

32:26.083 --> 32:28.792
M-M-MOUTHPIECE?

32:28.792 --> 32:29.458
MOUTH--

32:29.458 --> 32:32.333
WAIT A MINUTE.

32:32.333 --> 32:35.417
YOU SOLD YOUR--
YOUR GOOD LUCK
DOUG FLUTIE

32:35.417 --> 32:37.959
MEMORIAL MOUTHPIECE
JUST TO KISS ME?

32:41.458 --> 32:45.041
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
TO GAG OR BE
INCREDIBLY TOUCHED.

32:47.583 --> 32:50.917
[CHANTING]
KISS, KISS, KISS, KISS, KISS...

32:50.917 --> 32:55.125
KISS, KISS, KISS, KISS,
KISS, KISS, KISS, KISS...

32:55.125 --> 32:57.125
YOU--YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

32:57.125 --> 32:58.625
KISS, KISS, KISS,
KISS, KISS...

32:58.625 --> 33:00.792
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

33:00.792 --> 33:03.542
KISS, KISS, KISS, KISS,
KISS, KISS, KISS, KISS..

33:03.542 --> 33:05.166
KISS, KISS, KISS...

33:05.166 --> 33:06.583
COME HERE,
FRESHMAN.

33:06.583 --> 33:08.250
KISS, KISS, KISS!

33:08.250 --> 33:11.667
[CHEERING]

33:23.083 --> 33:25.625
OK, OK,
EVERYBODY
GO HOME!

33:25.625 --> 33:26.667
SHOW'S OVER,
FOLKS!

33:26.667 --> 33:28.959
GO HOME!

33:28.959 --> 33:31.125
NO, NO, NO.
NOT QUITE YET.

33:31.125 --> 33:33.500
WE HAVE A LITTLE
UNFINISHED BUSINESS
YET HERE.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.333
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
PRESENTING TO YOU

33:35.333 --> 33:40.208
YOUR CHOICE FOR CAPESIDE'S
1999 HOMECOMING QUEEN,

33:40.208 --> 33:41.500
MISS JENNIFER LINDLEY!

33:41.500 --> 33:45.000
[CHEERING]

33:52.667 --> 33:55.750
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.500
SEE? I TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING WOULD
WORK OUT FINE.

34:05.500 --> 34:07.708
YOU DID?

34:07.708 --> 34:09.750
YEAH! EVERYTHING
USUALLY WORKS OUT
FOR THE BEST

34:09.750 --> 34:10.792
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP
A POSITIVE ATTITUDE.

34:10.792 --> 34:12.875
POSITIVE ATTITUDE.

34:12.875 --> 34:16.041
OK. IS THIS
BEFORE OR AFTER

34:16.041 --> 34:17.750
I DISGRACED THE FAMILY'S
GOOD NAME

34:17.750 --> 34:20.583
AND FOREVER HUMILIATED
OUR FATHER, HUH?

34:20.583 --> 34:22.500
OH, I WOULDN'T
WORRY ABOUT THAT.
I'M SURE HE'S OVER IT.

34:22.500 --> 34:24.792
HE'S PROBABLY OUT
SAILING OR GOLFING
OR WHEREVER HE IS.

34:24.792 --> 34:26.667
I WOULDN'T GIVE IT
ANOTHER THOUGHT.

34:26.667 --> 34:28.291
ANDIE, YOU'RE MAKING
MY HEAD SPIN.

34:28.291 --> 34:31.583
LOOK, JACK, I AM
JUST GLAD IT'S OVER.

34:31.583 --> 34:34.333
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW RELIEVED I AM.

34:34.333 --> 34:37.166
HEY, SO WHO WON
THE GAME ANYWAY?

34:40.208 --> 34:42.458
SOMEBODY WAS SO SWEATY,
I COULDN'T EVEN BREATHE!

34:42.458 --> 34:45.250
WELL, SOMEBODY
WOULDN'T LET ME
TAKE MY SHIRT OFF.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.625
WELL, SOMEBODY FORGOT
TO OPEN THE AIR VENT!

34:47.625 --> 34:48.625
WELL, SOMEBODY
FORGOT TO MENTION

34:48.625 --> 34:51.250
THERE WERE AIR VENTS
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

34:51.250 --> 34:53.333
I TOLD YOU WE NEVER
SHOULD HAVE LISTENED
TO THOSE TWO SLACKERS.

34:54.750 --> 34:57.250
THIS IS IT?

34:57.250 --> 34:58.917
THIS IS THE SURPRISE?

34:58.917 --> 35:03.083
ISN'T SHE BEAUTIFUL?

35:03.083 --> 35:05.041
YEAH, IN A TITANIC
POST ICEBERG
SORT OF WAY.

35:05.041 --> 35:07.500
WHERE DID YOU
GET THIS?

35:07.500 --> 35:08.458
THIS FRIEND
OF MY BROTHER'S.

35:08.458 --> 35:09.792
HE WORKS DOWN
IN THE MARINA.

35:09.792 --> 35:11.500
HE RESCUED HER AFTER
THE LAST HURRICANE.

35:11.500 --> 35:12.875
THE GUY WHO OWNED HER
DIDN'T WANT HER
ANYMORE,

35:12.875 --> 35:16.208
SO I CONVINCED HIM
TO SELL HER TO ME
FOR, LIKE, 200 BUCKS.

35:16.208 --> 35:19.583
WHEN I FINISH WITH
THIS BOAT, IT IS GOING
TO BE SHEER PERFECTION.

35:19.583 --> 35:20.917
LOOK AT THAT.

35:20.917 --> 35:23.000
PACEY, DO YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH MONEY AND TIME
IT'LL TAKE YOU

35:23.000 --> 35:25.875
TO EVEN GET THIS BOAT
TO FLOAT?

35:25.875 --> 35:29.333
YEAH. NOT A MINUTE
MORE OR LESS THAN AS
LONG AS IT TAKES ME.

35:29.333 --> 35:32.083
YOU WATCH, POTTER.
COUPLE OF MONTHS,

35:32.083 --> 35:33.542
I'LL BE SAILING THIS BABY
AROUND THE WORLD.

35:33.542 --> 35:37.291
WELL, I HATE TO
BREAK IT TO YOU,
CAPTAIN STUBING,

35:37.291 --> 35:39.500
BUT YOU CAN'T SAIL
AROUND THE WORLD IN
A 20-FOOT BOAT.

35:39.500 --> 35:40.583
SURE, I CAN!

35:40.583 --> 35:41.792
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA
PUT THE SUPPLIES?

35:41.792 --> 35:43.375
HEY, THE U.S.S. MINNOW
WAS NO BIGGER THAN THIS,

35:43.375 --> 35:46.291
AND THEY FOUND ROOM FOR
ALL OF MR. HOWELL'S MONEY,

35:46.291 --> 35:48.208
ALL OF THE PROFESSOR'S TOOLS,
ALL OF GINGER'S CLOTHES--

35:48.208 --> 35:51.625
AND WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

35:51.625 --> 35:53.834
PERMISSION
TO COME ABOARD?

35:54.792 --> 35:56.583
PERMISSION GRANTED.

35:56.583 --> 35:57.667
THANK YOU.

35:59.375 --> 36:00.959
AH.

36:00.959 --> 36:04.625
AND NOW, THE PURPOSE
FOR OUR LITTLE FORAY
INTO TRUANCY...

36:08.291 --> 36:09.834
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

36:09.834 --> 36:11.667
"TRUE LOVE"?

36:11.667 --> 36:13.500
YEAH. IT'S MY GIRL'S
NAME.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.959
IT'S KINDA HIGH ON
THE SCHMALTZ FACTOR, HUH?

36:15.959 --> 36:17.417
ACUTELY.

36:19.417 --> 36:20.708
BUT SWEET.

36:20.708 --> 36:23.959
REMEMBER, I TOLD YOU
I NEEDED YOUR HELP
WITH SOMETHING.

36:23.959 --> 36:24.458
WITH WHAT?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.291
START SANDIN'.

36:30.834 --> 36:33.291
YOU ARE SO OVERBOARD.

37:24.458 --> 37:29.083
THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,
I BAWLED LIKE A BABY.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.959
DID YOU REALLY?

37:36.083 --> 37:39.875
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

37:39.875 --> 37:43.083
I THINK I CRIED
FOR 24 HOURS STRAIGHT.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.667
HOLDING YOU SO...

37:48.667 --> 37:51.417
SMALL IN MY ARMS.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.917
I NEVER KNEW I COULD
LOVE ANYTHING SO MUCH...

37:56.917 --> 37:57.959
SO FAST...

37:57.959 --> 38:01.208
SO UTTERLY.

38:01.208 --> 38:03.542
PART OF ME
WAS TERRIFIED.

38:06.959 --> 38:11.834
RAISING A SON
IS MORE A MATTER OF FAITH
THAN MOST PEOPLE KNOW.

38:11.834 --> 38:15.041
SO'S BEING ONE.

38:16.291 --> 38:17.583
YOU'RE RIGHT.

38:23.041 --> 38:25.208
I THINK I REALIZED
SOMETHING TODAY.

38:25.208 --> 38:26.250
WHAT?

38:26.250 --> 38:29.208
THAT MY JOB
AS A FATHER...

38:29.208 --> 38:31.875
ISN'T TO GIVE YOU
THE WHOLE PICTURE,

38:31.875 --> 38:35.834
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS,
I CAN'T SEE IT MYSELF.

38:35.834 --> 38:39.375
MY JOB
IS TO TRY AND HELP...

38:39.375 --> 38:42.959
EVERY NOW AND THEN
WITH A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE.

38:46.041 --> 38:47.875
YOU HAVE HELPED ME,
DAD.

38:47.875 --> 38:49.667
I HOPE SO.

38:52.083 --> 38:56.291
BUT YOUR...FUTURE,
YOUR EXPECTATIONS,

38:56.291 --> 38:59.500
THEY BELONG TO YOU.

38:59.500 --> 39:02.500
DON'T LET ANYBODY
STAND IN THE WAY.

39:04.708 --> 39:06.458
NOT EVEN ME.

39:06.458 --> 39:10.417
YOU ALWAYS PUSH ME
TO BE MY OWN PERSON,

39:10.417 --> 39:13.166
THINK FOR MYSELF.

39:16.166 --> 39:17.583
I JUST DID WHAT
YOU TAUGHT ME.

39:24.834 --> 39:26.166
SO WHAT DO YA SAY
WE GO HOME,

39:26.166 --> 39:30.792
POP IN A LITTLE
CLOSE ENCOUNTERS
OR SOMETHING, HUH?

39:30.792 --> 39:31.875
ACTUALLY...

39:33.583 --> 39:35.166
I WAS THINKING...

39:35.166 --> 39:37.458
HOW ABOUT
A GAME OF CATCH?

39:43.125 --> 39:44.834
GIMME THAT.

39:46.708 --> 39:49.750
WHY DON'T WE LEAVE
THE FOOTBALL HERE
ON THE FIELD

39:49.750 --> 39:51.542
WHERE IT BELONGS?

41:34.000 --> 41:35.083
Younger Dawson:
BYE, JOEY.

41:35.083 --> 41:36.667
Younger Joey:
BYE, DAWSON.
