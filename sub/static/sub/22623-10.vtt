WEBVTT

00:02.902 --> 00:05.570
You won't tell me why I'm
going to this address?

00:05.571 --> 00:08.273
- And ruin the surprise?
- I hate surprises.

00:08.274 --> 00:10.775
All the more reason not to tell you.

00:12.745 --> 00:14.746
It's Louisa Winchester's house.

00:14.747 --> 00:17.249
Louisa Winchester, the
young, beautiful,

00:17.250 --> 00:20.252
and now very wealthy widow
of Edward Winchester?

00:20.253 --> 00:22.354
Do I detect a note of jealousy?

00:22.355 --> 00:25.690
Please. Bourgeois life
is not appealing.

00:25.691 --> 00:27.859
Says anyone who's not bourgeois.

00:27.860 --> 00:29.928
Are you and she on friendly terms?

00:29.929 --> 00:32.631
Now that time, I definitely
detected a note of jealousy.

00:32.631 --> 00:34.533
Hemy.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.601
I met her on the society beat.

00:36.602 --> 00:38.570
She's entertaining.

00:38.571 --> 00:40.605
- I might even like her.
- Please.

00:40.606 --> 00:42.607
You hate the society beat.

00:42.608 --> 00:45.210
So what's really going on? A story?

00:45.211 --> 00:47.412
- It might even be big.
- And how do I fit in to it?

00:47.413 --> 00:49.414
She asked me to recommend
a private detective.

00:49.415 --> 00:51.216
Oh, and of course you thought of me.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.718
- I thought of a lot of people.
- Well, aren't you sweet.

00:53.719 --> 00:55.620
So what's the case?

00:55.621 --> 00:58.056
Well, I wouldn't dare
steal her thunder.

00:58.057 --> 01:00.058
Just do me a favour
and prove her right.

01:00.059 --> 01:03.228
Prove her right about what?

01:14.841 --> 01:17.509
Hello! You must

01:17.510 --> 01:20.412
be Miss Drake. Ernest has
told me so much about you.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.415
Well, I'm afraid Ernest did
not do me the same favour.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.517
I'm so happy you're taking the case.

01:25.518 --> 01:27.853
I'd love to know what
it is before I say yes.

01:27.854 --> 01:30.589
- Of course. Follow me.
- OK.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.591
Are those...

01:32.592 --> 01:34.593
Cossack dancers. Yeah.

01:34.594 --> 01:38.797
Sergei, Sasha, and Mischa.

01:38.798 --> 01:41.132
I've seen them perform last
week near the university,

01:41.133 --> 01:42.968
just arrived in town from Rochester.

01:42.969 --> 01:45.637
They look more like warriors.

01:45.638 --> 01:47.472
Well, people only
think of the dancing,

01:47.473 --> 01:49.441
but the Cossacks are
magnificent soldiers,

01:49.442 --> 01:51.977
known for their bravery
and their loyalty.

01:51.978 --> 01:54.379
And you invited them to
come stay at your home?

01:54.380 --> 01:56.681
Of course. I'm a great admirer
of all things Russian.

01:56.682 --> 02:00.151
- I have been since I was a girl.
- I can see why.

02:01.888 --> 02:04.322
My father was once
ambassador to Russia.

02:04.323 --> 02:07.526
It was a country of
beauty and culture.

02:07.527 --> 02:10.929
Since the revolution, Cossacks
are no longer welcome

02:10.930 --> 02:14.399
in their own homeland. They're
still loyal to Tsar Nicholas II

02:14.400 --> 02:17.235
despite his unforgivable
assassination by the Bolsheviks.

02:17.236 --> 02:19.237
Not to mention the murder

02:19.238 --> 02:21.373
of his wife, son and four daughters.

02:21.374 --> 02:23.708
I have reason to hope

02:23.709 --> 02:27.212
the rumours of his children's
demise are exaggerated...

02:27.213 --> 02:29.147
which is why you're here.

02:29.148 --> 02:31.149
Miss Drake,

02:31.150 --> 02:33.552
allow me to present

02:33.553 --> 02:36.488
the youngest daughter of
Tsar Nicholas II of Russia,

02:36.489 --> 02:39.257
the Great Duchess
Anastasia Nickolaevna.

02:39.258 --> 02:43.161
What?

02:43.162 --> 02:45.296
Oh!

02:47.199 --> 02:52.203
Subtitle sync and corrections by

02:57.643 --> 02:59.978
Ana is resting upstairs.

02:59.979 --> 03:02.013
I suppose I should have

03:02.014 --> 03:03.949
let her know before everyone else,

03:03.950 --> 03:05.884
but I didn't expect
her to be so shocked.

03:05.885 --> 03:08.253
It's not every day you find
out you're dead royalty.

03:08.254 --> 03:11.089
You can't believe everything
you read in the papers.

03:11.090 --> 03:14.259
British Intelligence is certain

03:14.260 --> 03:17.395
that the entire Romanov family
was executed by gunfire in 1918.

03:17.396 --> 03:20.265
Yet, the Russian government

03:20.266 --> 03:22.534
was very clear in denying the killing

03:22.535 --> 03:24.536
of the Tsarina Alexandra
and her four daughters.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.105
You can't believe everything
you read in the papers.

03:27.106 --> 03:30.408
Miss Drake, the instant I saw Ana,

03:30.409 --> 03:33.612
I recognized her as the
Grand Duchess Anastasia.

03:33.613 --> 03:35.647
You recognized her how?

03:35.648 --> 03:39.117
I met her once, at the winter palace.

03:39.118 --> 03:41.319
It was 1905.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.321
My father had taken me there.

03:43.322 --> 03:46.558
That's actually when the Tsar
Nicholas II gave me this.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.627
It was made by Faberge.

03:48.628 --> 03:50.462
The Faberge?

03:50.463 --> 03:53.732
He didn't just make eggs, you know.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.769
Mrs. Winchester, you can't...

03:57.770 --> 04:00.739
possibly believe that she
is a dead Russian princess

04:00.740 --> 04:02.574
just because you met
her once as a child.

04:02.575 --> 04:06.144
That's not the only reason.
She has a ring on a chain

04:06.145 --> 04:08.813
around her neck.
It's the Ring of Rasputin.

04:08.814 --> 04:11.683
- "The Ring of Rasputin"?
- I was there

04:11.684 --> 04:14.119
when Rasputin gave the
ring to Anastasia.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.954
She was his favourite.

04:15.955 --> 04:18.289
He said the ring would
protect her from harm.

04:18.290 --> 04:21.692
- Clearly, it has.
- Clearly.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.862
I'm not surprised by your skepticism.

04:23.863 --> 04:26.498
That's why I want to hire you

04:26.499 --> 04:29.000
to prove Ana is,
in fact, the princess.

04:29.001 --> 04:31.770
Well, if you believe she is,
what difference does it make?

04:31.771 --> 04:35.240
This isn't just for me.
The Bolshevik Revolution

04:35.241 --> 04:37.609
forced many Russians
to flee their country.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.045
And today, they're hoping for
the return of the monarchy

04:40.046 --> 04:42.013
and the Russia which once was.

04:42.014 --> 04:43.982
Anastasia will be that hope.

04:43.983 --> 04:46.384
Well, I'll look into it,

04:46.385 --> 04:48.286
but you might not like what I find.

04:48.287 --> 04:51.790
I have every confidence I will.

04:57.196 --> 04:59.464
Rasputin gave Anastasia the ring?

04:59.465 --> 05:01.933
That's what Mrs. Winchester claims.

05:01.934 --> 05:05.537
I don't know where it came from.

05:05.538 --> 05:07.372
I should've sold it months ago.

05:07.373 --> 05:09.641
I need the money, but...

05:09.642 --> 05:12.043
I can't bring myself to part with it.

05:12.044 --> 05:15.480
It feels important.

05:15.481 --> 05:18.349
Why don't we start at the beginning?

05:18.350 --> 05:21.386
Tell me where you're from.

05:21.387 --> 05:25.757
I don't know.
I can't remember anything

05:25.758 --> 05:27.859
before waking up in a
hospital in New York.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.829
Nothing at all? No names or faces?

05:30.830 --> 05:34.199
Sometimes I get a feeling I'm
familiar with something...

05:34.200 --> 05:37.068
or someone, like Mrs. Winchester.

05:37.069 --> 05:40.405
It's as if I've met her before.

05:40.406 --> 05:43.541
Clearly you're well educated.
Your English is perfect

05:43.542 --> 05:45.176
and I hear you speak
fluent Russian as well?

05:45.177 --> 05:48.546
Sometimes I'm not sure which
language I'm speaking.

05:52.051 --> 05:54.519
The next time, it's English.
They're both in my head.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.755
And where does the name Ana come from?

05:56.756 --> 05:59.424
The nurse at the hospital.
She said I told her

05:59.425 --> 06:01.993
that was my name when I was admitted.

06:01.994 --> 06:03.995
I was...

06:03.996 --> 06:06.097
in a bad way, apparently.

06:06.098 --> 06:09.234
- What else did she tell you?
- I was found

06:09.235 --> 06:11.202
wandering the streets,

06:11.203 --> 06:13.638
delirious, near the ferry
from Ellis Island.

06:13.639 --> 06:15.640
They assumed I came from Europe.

06:15.641 --> 06:18.243
There's no record of your entry?

06:18.244 --> 06:20.845
No. They think I was a stowaway.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.584
You don't believe I'm
Anastasia, do you?

06:28.554 --> 06:30.655
Do you?

06:33.893 --> 06:36.594
So, a Russian princess.
That's a new one.

06:36.595 --> 06:39.430
I doubt we'll find what Mrs.
Winchester is looking for.

06:39.431 --> 06:41.566
I mean, how do you prove
someone is a princess?

06:41.567 --> 06:44.803
- Make her sleep on a pea?
- I can always count on you.

06:44.804 --> 06:46.671
So what's the plan?

06:46.672 --> 06:49.607
Well, I think we should start
by talking to the dancers

06:49.608 --> 06:51.476
our princess was working for.

06:51.477 --> 06:53.511
Russian dancers? Ballerinas?

06:53.512 --> 06:55.613
Not exactly.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.884
Definitely not ballerinas.

06:59.885 --> 07:02.020
Which one do you want to talk to?

07:02.021 --> 07:04.255
You can take that one.

07:04.256 --> 07:07.659
I'm going over there.

07:07.660 --> 07:10.361
I met Ana six months ago

07:10.362 --> 07:12.197
at a hospital in New York.

07:12.198 --> 07:15.066
She spoke Russian so they
needed someone to translate.

07:15.067 --> 07:17.035
But by the time I arrived,

07:17.036 --> 07:18.937
she was speaking perfect English.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.172
And you had no idea who she
was or how she got there?

07:21.173 --> 07:23.408
No. Of course...

07:23.409 --> 07:25.276
I tried to find out who she was,

07:25.277 --> 07:27.712
but I had no luck. She is a mystery.

07:27.713 --> 07:29.714
And how did she end
up with your troupe?

07:29.715 --> 07:31.549
I took pity on her.

07:31.550 --> 07:33.718
She was all alone and had nothing.

07:33.719 --> 07:35.887
So how'd you become a performer?

07:35.888 --> 07:37.956
We can't be the Tsar's
cabaret anymore,

07:37.957 --> 07:39.958
and since the revolution,
people in America

07:39.959 --> 07:41.960
are crazy for all things Russian.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.462
So, when Sasha and I met Sergei,

07:44.463 --> 07:46.664
forming a performing troupe
was a simple decision.

07:46.665 --> 07:49.534
Mischa and I are cousins.
I came here with my mother

07:49.535 --> 07:51.836
when I was a boy, and my
father stayed behind in Russia

07:51.837 --> 07:54.172
- to serve the Tsar.
- What do you think of Ana?

07:54.173 --> 07:57.709
Well, she's not Anastasia.

07:57.710 --> 07:59.544
There are rumours of survivors,

07:59.545 --> 08:01.512
but only because those
loyal to the Tsar

08:01.513 --> 08:03.348
don't want to believe
the Romanovs are gone.

08:03.349 --> 08:05.750
All these months I
wondered who she might be.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.585
Why not Anastasia?

08:07.586 --> 08:09.954
She speaks perfect Russian,
French, English.

08:09.955 --> 08:11.990
I've even heard some German.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.058
She's not Anastasia.

08:14.059 --> 08:16.094
The princess is dead, Miss Drake.

08:16.095 --> 08:19.263
A man like Lenin doesn't win a
revolution by being merciful.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.201
No, Mrs. Winchester's chasing a ghost.

08:26.272 --> 08:28.973
Well, that got us nowhere.

08:28.974 --> 08:31.442
- We need something more concrete.
- Let's get a medical exam,

08:31.443 --> 08:34.044
see if she even matches what we
know about Anastasia physically.

08:34.046 --> 08:36.080
- I'll call Flo.
- Something about this

08:36.081 --> 08:38.883
smells funny. A wealthy,
Russian-obsessed widow

08:38.884 --> 08:41.251
who just happens to find a
presumed-dead princess?

08:41.253 --> 08:43.221
Well, when you put it like that...

08:43.222 --> 08:45.757
but if it is a con,
then Ana's a very good actress.

08:45.758 --> 08:47.859
Time to call in an expert.

08:53.198 --> 08:55.033
Let me get this straight.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.001
You want me to con a rich widow?

08:57.002 --> 08:59.570
No. I don't want you to con
her. I want you to find out

08:59.571 --> 09:02.106
- if she's being conned.
- Oh. Yeah. OK.

09:02.107 --> 09:05.710
That makes more sense. So, how
would you like me to play it?

09:05.711 --> 09:09.080
Go to the house, poke around,
see if you can find out

09:09.081 --> 09:11.549
- who is conning whom.
- I mean, what's the angle?

09:11.550 --> 09:14.285
- What is my role?
- Long lost family friend?

09:14.286 --> 09:16.220
- My Russian accent stinks.
- Well, you could be

09:16.221 --> 09:19.257
- part of the staff.
- I don't do servant class.

09:19.258 --> 09:22.126
- If you don't wanna do this...
- I didn't say I didn't want to!

09:22.127 --> 09:24.796
You know, there's a
room full of Faberge.

09:24.797 --> 09:28.166
Faberge? Now you're
speaking my language.

09:28.167 --> 09:30.601
You say this Mrs. Winchester's

09:30.602 --> 09:33.271
intent on introducing this girl
to the world as a princess.

09:33.272 --> 09:35.840
- That's right.
- Hmm.

09:35.841 --> 09:38.709
I just might have an idea.

09:46.852 --> 09:49.020
That's it.

09:49.021 --> 09:51.022
You've been a remarkably
quiet patient.

09:51.023 --> 09:53.825
I almost thought I was
working on one of my usuals.

09:53.826 --> 09:56.127
I hope my blood pressure's a
little higher than theirs.

09:56.128 --> 09:59.797
- So, how'd it go?
- I like this kid.

09:59.798 --> 10:02.533
She's got a sense of humour.
Well, I'd put Ana

10:02.534 --> 10:04.936
around 20 years of age,
give or take a year.

10:04.937 --> 10:08.272
That would match Anastasia's age.

10:08.273 --> 10:10.842
She's got good teeth,
no developmental defects and she

10:10.843 --> 10:13.144
was well taken care of as a
child. She ate properly.

10:13.145 --> 10:15.213
OK, so she wasn't poor. Another match.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.315
Your blood doesn't clot very quickly.

10:17.316 --> 10:20.151
Could she be a hemophiliac?
All of Queen Victoria's

10:20.152 --> 10:22.620
descendants were, and Anastasia
is her great granddaughter.

10:22.621 --> 10:25.390
Ana could be a carrier of the
disease, or she just might

10:25.391 --> 10:27.358
take a lot of Aspirin,
which I suspect you do.

10:27.359 --> 10:30.194
You're right. I often
suffer from headaches.

10:30.195 --> 10:32.330
But how did you know?

10:32.331 --> 10:35.967
The scar on your hairline gave me
a clue, which is why I pulled in

10:35.968 --> 10:38.169
a favour from one of the gals in
radiology down at the hospital,

10:38.170 --> 10:40.371
and had her take this.

10:44.309 --> 10:46.911
- Is that a bullet?
- That's exactly what that is.

10:46.912 --> 10:48.980
That means I've been shot in the head.

10:48.981 --> 10:52.417
- At some point, yeah.
- Anastasia faced

10:52.418 --> 10:56.587
- a firing squad.
- How long ago was she shot?

10:56.588 --> 10:58.423
It's hard to say.

10:58.424 --> 11:00.425
At least a year ago, probably longer.

11:00.426 --> 11:03.094
But how can I even be alive?

11:03.095 --> 11:05.329
The brain is a complex organ.

11:05.330 --> 11:08.499
There are many cases of severe
damage to it that never affect

11:08.500 --> 11:10.334
the patient. You're
functioning normally

11:10.335 --> 11:12.703
in almost every aspect, but the bullet

11:12.704 --> 11:14.839
might explain the memory loss.

11:16.708 --> 11:18.576
Then I won't get my memory back?

11:18.577 --> 11:20.611
Anything is possible.

11:20.612 --> 11:23.548
Anything.

11:30.756 --> 11:32.690
Mrs. Winchester. Sorry to bother you.

11:32.691 --> 11:34.592
We just need a moment.

11:34.593 --> 11:36.694
Oh! Well now!

11:36.695 --> 11:38.930
Are these your private
detectives? Women?

11:38.931 --> 11:40.932
What a very interesting choice.

11:40.933 --> 11:44.268
Miss Drake, Miss Clarke,
this is Mrs. Amory.

11:44.269 --> 11:46.804
She's a specialist in...
how do you put it?

11:46.805 --> 11:50.475
Makeovers. Well,
transformations, actually.

11:50.476 --> 11:53.444
Bringing out the class
in someone. Remind me

11:53.445 --> 11:57.215
- to give you two my card.
- Nice to meet you as well.

11:57.216 --> 12:00.017
Mrs. Amory's responsible
for the grooming

12:00.018 --> 12:01.886
of the wayward daughter
of Lady Astoria

12:01.887 --> 12:03.888
for the London season.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.890
Who was an absolute sensation,
if I do say so!

12:05.891 --> 12:09.627
That's... amazing.
You're a princess-maker.

12:09.628 --> 12:11.562
Oh, no, no, no.

12:11.563 --> 12:13.498
I don't make princesses. I merely

12:13.499 --> 12:16.033
reintroduce her to her true self,

12:16.034 --> 12:19.470
exactly what Mrs. Winchester
here wants. Isn't that so?

12:19.471 --> 12:22.140
- Absolutely.
- Now, I presume

12:22.141 --> 12:23.941
- you have something to tell me.
- Yes.

12:23.942 --> 12:25.977
A medical examination
was performed on Ana.

12:25.978 --> 12:28.579
- And?
- We took an x-ray of her skull.

12:28.580 --> 12:30.681
An x-ray? What's wrong?

12:30.682 --> 12:33.317
She has a bullet lodged in her brain.

12:33.318 --> 12:35.486
Holy cow! As you say.

12:35.487 --> 12:37.822
The bullet from the firing squad.

12:37.823 --> 12:40.191
It's her!

12:40.192 --> 12:42.326
The Grand Duchess Anastasia
is under my roof.

12:42.327 --> 12:45.463
- It's too soon to say for sure.
- Well, you don't have to say

12:45.464 --> 12:49.367
anything more. Thank you
for your hard work,

12:49.368 --> 12:51.669
but I won't be needing
your services any longer.

12:51.670 --> 12:54.205
Well, now that that's settled,
where do we begin?

12:54.206 --> 12:56.040
Where, exactly!

12:56.041 --> 12:57.642
We have a lot of work to
do to get the princess

12:57.643 --> 12:59.744
ready for her debut!

13:05.784 --> 13:08.019
- Well, how do you like that?
- Unbelievable.

13:08.020 --> 13:09.887
What are we gonna do about Nora?

13:09.888 --> 13:12.023
As long as her accent holds, nothing.

13:12.024 --> 13:14.659
Trudy...

13:19.565 --> 13:21.566
It's addressed to Anastasia.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.601
But who knows she's here?

13:25.470 --> 13:27.538
Caviar?

13:27.539 --> 13:31.242
"All Romanovs must die."

13:39.175 --> 13:40.518
We checked with the staff.

13:40.519 --> 13:43.120
- No one saw or heard anything.
- There's no postmark,

13:43.121 --> 13:44.989
which means it was hand
delivered. It would have been

13:44.990 --> 13:47.992
easy enough for someone
without anyone noticing.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.827
The grounds were searched,
but most likely, whoever left

13:49.828 --> 13:52.263
- the package is long gone.
- Obviously it was Bolsheviks!

13:52.264 --> 13:54.265
Somehow they knew about Anastasia.

13:54.266 --> 13:57.001
- We can't just jump to that conclusion.
- Who else could it be?

13:57.002 --> 13:58.936
You never told anyone
outside this house?

13:58.937 --> 14:01.906
No. And my staff, I
have absolute faith in.

14:01.907 --> 14:03.908
- The Cossacks?
- They're sworn

14:03.909 --> 14:06.243
- to protect a Romanov.
- Someone believes

14:06.244 --> 14:09.113
- Ana is Anastasia.
- Which means she's still in danger.

14:09.114 --> 14:11.515
So what should we do?

14:11.516 --> 14:13.350
The first thing we can do is
drop all of this Anastasia

14:13.351 --> 14:15.986
business. That's the only way
we can ensure your safety.

14:15.987 --> 14:18.789
Impossible! This will
only be the first

14:18.790 --> 14:20.691
of many challenges the
princess must face.

14:20.692 --> 14:22.993
Do I not have any say in this?

14:22.994 --> 14:25.863
Is it my life! I know

14:25.864 --> 14:28.132
the medical report. I have
the Ring of Rasputin.

14:28.133 --> 14:30.067
There is a bullet in my head!

14:32.370 --> 14:34.305
All those feelings I've had...

14:34.306 --> 14:36.640
I believe I am Anastasia.

14:38.677 --> 14:40.911
Last of the Romanovs.

14:42.714 --> 14:44.515
I am glad

14:44.516 --> 14:46.350
to see you've realized who you are.

14:46.351 --> 14:49.820
Even if it puts you in danger?

14:49.821 --> 14:52.489
Even then.

14:58.330 --> 15:00.564
And let us try this
once again, shall we?

15:00.565 --> 15:02.566
Shoulders back.

15:02.567 --> 15:05.035
And chin up. Up, my dear.

15:05.036 --> 15:07.037
A princess must have better posture

15:07.038 --> 15:09.840
- than a dockworker.
- Do I really have

15:09.841 --> 15:12.843
- to learn all this?
- Actually...

15:12.844 --> 15:15.145
I am surprised that you
have forgotten it all.

15:15.146 --> 15:17.214
Breeding, my dear, is innate.

15:17.215 --> 15:19.083
Meaning?

15:19.084 --> 15:20.918
Meaning it should come
naturally to you.

15:20.919 --> 15:24.822
- Are you testing me?
- No. I'm merely here to help,

15:24.823 --> 15:27.491
but if you don't want me to...

15:27.492 --> 15:30.194
Is that any way to address royalty?

15:30.195 --> 15:32.496
Now that's more like it.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.167
Mrs. Amory, can we have a word?

15:37.168 --> 15:39.236
Certainly. And while I'm gone,

15:39.237 --> 15:41.505
you two might practice
the waltz. Miss Clark,

15:41.506 --> 15:44.475
you lead.

15:47.612 --> 15:50.147
So what do you think? Is she
pulling one over on everyone

15:50.148 --> 15:53.884
- like you are with that accent?
- Whatsoever do you mean?!

15:53.885 --> 15:56.553
Well, she certainly has the attitude

15:56.554 --> 15:58.389
and she did buy into the whole
princess idea pretty quick.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.724
- Didn't she?
- Yeah! What better way to sell

16:00.725 --> 16:03.013
yourself as a hated royal
than to fake a death threat?

16:03.014 --> 16:04.157
I thought so too.

16:04.158 --> 16:07.031
Yeah! See? You and me, we think alike.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.867
- Well, that isn't comforting.
- Well... On the other hand,

16:09.868 --> 16:12.436
- if she's not faking it...
- Who's trying to hurt the girl?

16:12.437 --> 16:15.039
Right! So what do you wanna do now?

16:15.040 --> 16:17.107
Well... you continue waltzing.
I'm gonna find the fish

16:17.108 --> 16:19.209
- that laid these eggs.
- Good.

16:27.585 --> 16:30.521
Such a tragic tale:

16:30.522 --> 16:33.290
a royal family...

16:33.291 --> 16:35.392
executions...

16:35.393 --> 16:39.096
love... betrayal... revolution.

16:39.097 --> 16:41.165
And now, suddenly,

16:41.166 --> 16:43.967
a supposedly dead heir
to the throne appearing?

16:43.968 --> 16:46.270
It's all so...

16:46.271 --> 16:48.505
well, very Russian.

16:48.506 --> 16:51.909
I didn't realize you
were such a romantic.

16:51.910 --> 16:54.144
Oh, I have read them all!

16:54.145 --> 16:57.081
Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Pushkin.

16:57.082 --> 16:59.483
So you're a fan of Russian literature?

16:59.484 --> 17:01.318
Oh, yes. When I was
growing up, there was

17:01.319 --> 17:03.987
an elderly Russian woman who
lived next door to us, and she

17:03.988 --> 17:06.457
- taught me all about them.
- In exile?

17:06.458 --> 17:09.593
No, she left Russia by choice.
The way she told it,

17:09.594 --> 17:11.862
life living under the
Tsar wasn't exactly...

17:11.863 --> 17:13.997
pleasant for most people.

17:13.998 --> 17:16.133
Revolutions tend to
happen for a reason.

17:18.103 --> 17:20.137
So do you really think
that it could be her?

17:20.137 --> 17:23.607
The bullet wound is very
compelling evidence.

17:23.608 --> 17:26.377
- It does sound compelling.
- But not conclusive.

17:26.377 --> 17:30.447
Mary, do you have any
connections in New York City?

17:30.448 --> 17:33.350
- No, not really. Why?
- I need you to check and see

17:33.351 --> 17:35.719
if there's anyone matching
Ana's description

17:35.720 --> 17:39.123
from missing person reports in New
York over the last few years.

17:39.124 --> 17:41.825
I'll get right on it. Here's your fan.

17:41.826 --> 17:43.927
Thank you.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.404
I came as soon as I got your message.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.406
Did you prove she's the princess?

17:55.407 --> 17:57.241
No, not yet.

17:57.242 --> 17:59.843
It could be the scoop of the
century. "Russian Princess

17:59.844 --> 18:02.579
found Alive in Hogtown." It's
got a nice ring, doesn't it?

18:02.580 --> 18:05.082
You're researching all
things Russian, aren't you?

18:05.083 --> 18:07.718
- Why?
- Where in Hogtown

18:07.719 --> 18:09.720
might I find Bolsheviks?

18:09.721 --> 18:12.923
I don't suspect there are
many around. If there are,

18:12.924 --> 18:14.925
- they keep a low profile.
- And why is that?

18:14.926 --> 18:17.027
Well, the Russians that
are here are loyalists.

18:17.028 --> 18:19.029
They hate Bolsheviks. Why do you ask?

18:19.030 --> 18:21.899
There was a death threat against Ana.

18:21.900 --> 18:25.769
If anyone would want her dead,
it would be a Bolshevik.

18:25.770 --> 18:27.604
Well, I wish I could help you.

18:27.605 --> 18:31.208
There might be something you can do.

18:31.209 --> 18:33.710
Where would I find this?

18:44.956 --> 18:47.090
Why are you holding my hand?

18:47.091 --> 18:49.193
To avoid arousing suspicion.

18:49.194 --> 18:51.261
- Why?
- I may have been here

18:51.262 --> 18:53.263
once or twice before, doing research.

18:53.264 --> 18:55.966
"All things Russian."
Just... play along.

18:58.203 --> 19:00.037
Alexei.

19:00.038 --> 19:03.974
You again? And this
is the lovely Miss...

19:03.975 --> 19:06.643
Oh.

19:06.644 --> 19:08.745
My mistake. And what would madam like?

19:08.746 --> 19:10.747
Darling.

19:10.748 --> 19:12.749
Let's go all out.

19:12.750 --> 19:16.220
- Whatever you desire.
- Vodka.

19:16.221 --> 19:17.955
We might have a bottle tucked away.

19:17.956 --> 19:19.957
And caviar.

19:19.958 --> 19:21.959
But we're very selective,
aren't we, dear?

19:21.960 --> 19:24.628
- Very.
- I would love to see

19:24.629 --> 19:27.230
- the tin first if possible.
- Of course.

19:29.434 --> 19:31.735
"Research"?

19:31.736 --> 19:33.770
Once or twice.

19:33.771 --> 19:35.806
Was she good at shorthand?

19:35.807 --> 19:38.108
Are we back to jealousy now?

19:38.109 --> 19:41.078
Let's just focus on finding out

19:41.079 --> 19:43.914
if there's anyone here who
wants a princess dead.

19:43.915 --> 19:46.416
My Aunt Marie

19:46.417 --> 19:50.587
is in England. My grandmother,
the dowager empress Xenia,

19:50.588 --> 19:53.657
is in Denmark with my aunt...

19:53.658 --> 19:55.692
Olga. And Xenia

19:55.693 --> 19:57.694
is in England, Marie is in Denmark.

19:57.695 --> 19:59.563
A princess can't

19:59.564 --> 20:01.465
bugger up her family tree.

20:01.466 --> 20:05.202
Why, oh why, is there
not a drop of vodka

20:05.203 --> 20:07.604
in this entire Russian smorgasbord?

20:07.605 --> 20:09.473
I'm never going to remember it all!

20:09.474 --> 20:11.508
All the royals in Europe are related

20:11.509 --> 20:13.810
in one way or another.
It's so complicated!

20:13.811 --> 20:16.680
And tawdry, dear. Don't forget tawdry.

20:16.681 --> 20:19.149
I need to use the toilet.

20:19.150 --> 20:21.785
All right, but that kind of language

20:21.786 --> 20:24.588
is going to shock
your royal relations.

20:29.060 --> 20:31.061
Psst! Trudy, darling.

20:31.062 --> 20:33.330
- Cover for me. I gotta pop out.
- Me?

20:33.331 --> 20:35.632
Yeah! Just do it.

20:40.371 --> 20:42.205
I trust this will do.

20:42.206 --> 20:44.074
That's perfect.

20:44.075 --> 20:46.677
So tell me, where would I buy that?

20:46.678 --> 20:49.513
We are the only place in the
city where you can get it.

20:49.514 --> 20:51.315
Oh. Well, that's good to know.

20:51.316 --> 20:55.419
So, tell me... do you miss the Tsar?

20:55.420 --> 20:59.156
The best thing that happened to Russia

20:59.157 --> 21:01.058
is the death of that swine.

21:01.059 --> 21:04.895
Surely not all Russians agree.

21:04.896 --> 21:08.265
All true Russians do. As Lenin said,

21:11.502 --> 21:14.037
Which means freedom of discussion,

21:14.038 --> 21:17.441
unity of action.
We are Bolsheviks here.

21:17.442 --> 21:20.577
What about the rumours that
some of the Romanovs survived?

21:20.578 --> 21:22.512
I have heard these rumours.

21:22.513 --> 21:25.182
Some even say the Tsar's
daughter survived,

21:25.183 --> 21:27.718
that one of them was
seen in New York City,

21:27.719 --> 21:29.886
that she crossed the
border into Canada.

21:29.887 --> 21:32.489
- And what do you say?
- I say...

21:32.490 --> 21:35.859
if there are survivors,
we will find them.

21:35.860 --> 21:38.595
There will be no warning.

21:38.596 --> 21:41.998
There will only be death. Excuse me.

21:45.303 --> 21:47.371
I had no idea Alexei was a Bolshevik.

21:47.372 --> 21:49.640
- I have to warn Ana.
- Then let's get the hell

21:49.641 --> 21:51.975
- out of here.
- No. You stay here.

21:51.976 --> 21:54.211
See what you can find out
over this bottle of vodka.

21:54.212 --> 21:57.714
The things I do for you.

22:01.919 --> 22:04.020
Ana?

22:06.457 --> 22:08.525
Ana?!

22:28.680 --> 22:31.481
A Romanov cannot be
with a man like me.

22:31.482 --> 22:33.784
It doesn't matter who I am.

22:33.785 --> 22:35.752
It won't change anything between us.

22:35.753 --> 22:39.122
It changes everything.

22:39.123 --> 22:41.792
I'm sorry.

22:41.793 --> 22:44.795
This has to be goodbye.

22:54.972 --> 22:56.973
You and Sasha?

22:56.974 --> 22:59.209
No one knew.

22:59.210 --> 23:01.111
Sergei would not have approved.

23:01.112 --> 23:04.147
He would've sent me away.
Promise you won't tell him?

23:04.148 --> 23:06.883
I promise.

23:06.884 --> 23:10.387
Sasha and I had plans to marry, but...

23:10.388 --> 23:12.756
now I am a princess.

23:15.993 --> 23:18.461
I guess this is the life
I have ahead of me.

23:22.633 --> 23:24.534
There are Bolsheviks here

23:24.535 --> 23:26.703
in Toronto and we believe
they know about Ana.

23:26.704 --> 23:28.905
- How is that possible?
- I'm not sure.

23:28.906 --> 23:31.007
But I don't think they would
hesitate to harm her.

23:31.008 --> 23:34.544
After all that's happened,
what is there to be afraid of?

23:34.545 --> 23:37.747
- Get down!
- Get her to safety!

23:45.123 --> 23:47.157
We'll never find him out here.

23:47.158 --> 23:49.359
He's long gone.

23:51.829 --> 23:54.231
Where's Ana? We need to
get to her right away.

23:54.232 --> 23:56.133
I took her to her room.

23:56.134 --> 23:58.668
That's Ana!

23:58.669 --> 24:00.670
Anastasia!

24:00.671 --> 24:03.707
- Ana?
- Are you OK?

24:05.610 --> 24:08.246
The ring... they stole it.

24:22.184 --> 24:24.518
It all happened so suddenly.

24:24.519 --> 24:26.587
The lights went out and I
felt a pull on my neck.

24:26.588 --> 24:28.556
I thought I was being strangled,

24:28.557 --> 24:30.724
but... they only took the ring.

24:30.725 --> 24:33.027
Not much of a Bolshevik
assassin if all he did

24:33.028 --> 24:36.664
was steal Ana's ring. It seems
downright capitalist, in fact.

24:36.665 --> 24:39.667
Mrs. Winchester, you really believe

24:39.668 --> 24:42.136
- this is all about the ring?
- Is it that valuable?

24:42.137 --> 24:44.905
Well, yes, but not in the
way you might think.

24:44.906 --> 24:47.975
Rasputin had powers
gifted to him from God.

24:47.976 --> 24:49.910
You really think people believe

24:49.911 --> 24:51.946
that this ring has magical powers?

24:51.947 --> 24:54.848
Absolutely.

24:56.918 --> 24:59.820
Ugh! You don't have

24:59.821 --> 25:02.156
to tell me, Boris darling.
I know this is the backwoods

25:02.157 --> 25:04.158
and don't ask me to
explain why I'm here.

25:04.159 --> 25:06.527
So, did you talk to your
charming friend at Sotheby's?

25:06.528 --> 25:08.429
No, no, no.

25:08.430 --> 25:10.364
I told you, about the dog,
not the egg.

25:10.365 --> 25:13.133
Oh, well, isn't that
interesting. And it fetched

25:13.134 --> 25:15.569
how much? How much?!

25:15.570 --> 25:17.972
Phew, so I heard you
right the first time.

25:17.973 --> 25:20.541
Well, let me tell you, Mrs. W's
got a room full of the stuff.

25:24.646 --> 25:27.815
Oh, Boris, you're such a
naughty boy, and I'd love to.

25:27.816 --> 25:30.384
Really, I would, but I can't.
Not right now.

25:30.385 --> 25:33.320
Yeah. Kisses and all that, darling.

25:41.630 --> 25:45.165
Hemy. You look terrible.

25:47.269 --> 25:50.838
All for a noble cause.
Any developments?

25:50.839 --> 25:53.173
There is, in fact.

25:53.174 --> 25:56.710
Ana was shot at. And
a ring that Rasputin

25:56.711 --> 25:58.879
apparently gave to
Anastasia was stolen

25:58.880 --> 26:01.315
- from around Ana's neck.
- Alexei was telling the truth.

26:01.316 --> 26:04.151
- What do you mean?
- Well, after you left,

26:04.152 --> 26:06.186
the vodka loosened up Alexei

26:06.187 --> 26:08.689
and he told me that a
famous Bolshevik assassin

26:08.690 --> 26:11.859
was in town. Anton Andreevich.

26:11.860 --> 26:13.727
He arrived by boat from the states

26:13.728 --> 26:15.529
and he was apparently at
the Tsar's execution.

26:15.530 --> 26:18.432
- He could be the shooter.
- I've got a source

26:18.433 --> 26:20.434
at the ferry docks.
I'll see what I can find out.

26:20.435 --> 26:24.004
That would be terrific.

26:24.005 --> 26:27.074
Frankie...

26:36.451 --> 26:39.286
Ahem.

26:39.287 --> 26:41.555
Well, I look forward to seeing
how all this turns out.

26:41.556 --> 26:43.657
Me too.

26:53.268 --> 26:55.269
It took a little doing, but I

26:55.270 --> 26:58.205
found something, thanks to a
gabby detective on the NYPD.

26:58.206 --> 27:00.607
I'm all ears.

27:00.608 --> 27:02.543
Are you feeling all right?
You're looking a little flushed.

27:02.544 --> 27:05.279
I'm fine! What's in the envelope?

27:05.280 --> 27:08.282
Ah!

27:08.283 --> 27:10.718
Mona Simmons. 23.

27:10.719 --> 27:13.987
Born Mona Gregorovich.
She immigrates here

27:13.988 --> 27:16.423
by herself from Russia in 1915.

27:16.424 --> 27:19.293
In 1916, she marries Leonard Simmons.

27:19.294 --> 27:22.629
Then in 1917, she goes missing,
and the police believe

27:22.630 --> 27:24.565
her husband had something
to do with it.

27:24.566 --> 27:27.000
So why do you think she might be Ana?

27:27.001 --> 27:29.570
Well, the police eventually discovered

27:29.571 --> 27:31.905
that Mona was shot in the head.

27:31.906 --> 27:34.141
And she survived?

27:34.142 --> 27:35.976
Well, according to the
police report, she managed

27:35.977 --> 27:38.579
to get herself to a nearby
Catholic church, where the nuns

27:38.580 --> 27:40.514
- were able to treat her wounds.
- And then?

27:40.515 --> 27:42.483
Well, the Mother
Superior told the police

27:42.484 --> 27:44.485
that after Mona recovered,

27:44.486 --> 27:47.421
she just disappeared. And
that's where the report ends.

27:47.422 --> 27:49.757
But Frankie, here's the thing.

27:49.758 --> 27:51.892
The Mother Superior's
description of Mona

27:51.893 --> 27:54.261
matches Ana to a T.

27:54.262 --> 27:56.530
And there's no trail
of her afterwards?

27:56.531 --> 27:59.099
Not that I could find.

27:59.100 --> 28:02.469
So Ana might be Mona Gregorovich.

28:02.470 --> 28:05.138
She very well could be.

28:06.975 --> 28:09.910
So a Bolshevik assassin
shot at Ana, missed,

28:09.911 --> 28:12.312
then broke into the
house and attacked her.

28:12.313 --> 28:15.382
Maybe they had an accomplice,
someone working on the inside.

28:15.383 --> 28:18.719
So where's the ring? The house
has been searched up and down,

28:18.720 --> 28:21.522
special attention paid to
the staff. No sign of it.

28:21.523 --> 28:24.057
What about Mrs. Winchester?
I mean, she was here

28:24.058 --> 28:26.393
- when the ring was stolen.
- You can't believe that.

28:26.394 --> 28:28.295
Maybe she can't, but I can.
This is a con,

28:28.296 --> 28:30.297
just the other way around.
That's a cheap knockoff.

28:30.298 --> 28:32.466
So's that. And this dog...

28:32.467 --> 28:34.701
- That is too?
- No. That's real.

28:34.702 --> 28:37.171
That's what I was off doing,
talking to an old friend

28:37.172 --> 28:39.706
who knows where these
sorts of items are.

28:39.707 --> 28:41.875
Mrs. Winchester said that
the Tsar gave it to her

28:41.876 --> 28:43.777
at the winter palace before the war.

28:43.778 --> 28:46.346
Yeah. Nice story. The truth
is her late husband bought it

28:46.347 --> 28:48.549
- at an auction.
- She lied. Why?

28:48.550 --> 28:51.285
More importantly, what else
has she been lying about?

28:57.659 --> 28:59.760
I don't think you ever met Anastasia

28:59.761 --> 29:02.262
or watched Rasputin put
a ring around her neck.

29:02.263 --> 29:05.032
So what kind of con
are you running here?

29:05.033 --> 29:07.267
It's no con. And I didn't
steal the ring. I would never

29:07.268 --> 29:09.870
- hurt a Romanov.
- Why should I believe you?

29:09.871 --> 29:11.839
My father really was

29:11.840 --> 29:13.907
ambassador to Russia. My mother and I

29:13.908 --> 29:16.376
stayed home, but I did
visit once, as a child,

29:16.377 --> 29:18.545
and that's when I heard the
stories about Rasputin

29:18.546 --> 29:21.715
and the Tsar's family.
One night, my father

29:21.716 --> 29:24.184
was attending a banquet for the Tsar.

29:24.185 --> 29:27.421
He was mistakenly given the
Tsar's plate and was poisoned.

29:27.422 --> 29:29.756
He died an agonizing death.

29:29.757 --> 29:31.892
I'm sorry.

29:31.893 --> 29:33.894
It is my duty to make sure the death

29:33.895 --> 29:36.864
of my father was not in vain.
He saved the Tsar,

29:36.865 --> 29:39.466
now his daughter must
save the Tsar's daughter.

29:39.467 --> 29:41.935
Here's the problem. I think
I know who Ana really is.

29:41.936 --> 29:44.571
- You do?
- Yeah.

29:44.572 --> 29:47.107
A woman named Mona Gregorovich.

29:47.108 --> 29:49.710
She was a young, Russian immigrant

29:49.711 --> 29:52.813
who disappeared from New York. It would
explain the language, it would explain

29:52.814 --> 29:54.948
- where she came from...
- But the bullet?

29:54.949 --> 29:57.551
Even that can be explained. I know you

29:57.552 --> 29:59.987
really want her to be Anastasia,
but if she's not,

29:59.988 --> 30:03.257
there's a young, innocent
woman who's in great danger.

30:03.258 --> 30:06.593
Of course. You're right.

30:06.594 --> 30:08.595
How do we stop this?

30:08.596 --> 30:11.098
The first thing we have
to do is find that ring.

30:11.099 --> 30:13.967
Well, at least Mrs. Winchester

30:13.968 --> 30:16.136
finally understands how serious
the threat against Ana is.

30:16.137 --> 30:19.139
Not that it changes anything.
There's still a killer on the loose.

30:19.140 --> 30:21.108
Find the ring, find the assassin.

30:21.109 --> 30:23.176
- Exactly.
- What about the Cossacks?

30:23.177 --> 30:25.612
Ana's been with them for
months. I mean, if one

30:25.613 --> 30:28.682
of them wanted to steal the ring,
they could have done it ages ago.

30:28.683 --> 30:30.784
Yeah, but she wasn't Princess
Anastasia then, and the ring

30:30.785 --> 30:33.487
was just the ring. They found
out the same time we did.

30:33.488 --> 30:35.389
OK. Well, then, which one

30:35.390 --> 30:37.291
would it be? Maybe it was all of them.

30:37.292 --> 30:39.293
Yeah, but I doubt it was Sasha,

30:39.294 --> 30:42.462
- since he and Ana were lovers.
- That leaves Sergei and Mischa.

30:42.463 --> 30:44.298
I'll talk to Sergei.

30:44.299 --> 30:46.266
You get Mischa.

30:50.672 --> 30:53.540
Hello.

30:57.512 --> 30:59.646
Put that down. It's not a toy.

30:59.647 --> 31:01.682
Don't worry. I know my way

31:01.683 --> 31:04.117
- around a sword.
- Not this kind of sword.

31:04.118 --> 31:07.621
How about a duel?

31:07.622 --> 31:09.623
This isn't fencing.

31:09.624 --> 31:12.626
That sword is sharp.
One touch and you will bleed.

31:12.627 --> 31:15.195
I'm not afraid of a little blood.

31:15.196 --> 31:18.465
You know how to fire a gun?

31:18.466 --> 31:21.568
I'm a Cossack. Of course I
know how to fire a gun,

31:21.569 --> 31:23.570
but I prefer the sword.

31:25.306 --> 31:27.341
Don't jab. Curve your arm

31:27.342 --> 31:29.676
with the blade. Why do you ask?

31:33.548 --> 31:35.716
Where were you when
Ana's ring was stolen?

31:35.717 --> 31:38.585
- The ring has been stolen?
- You seem surprised.

31:38.586 --> 31:41.154
I have more important things to
do than play fight with you.

31:45.893 --> 31:48.762
You're not leaving?

31:48.763 --> 31:51.698
Please, get out of my way.

31:51.699 --> 31:54.901
We barely got to know each other.

31:54.902 --> 31:57.504
There's something between us.

31:57.505 --> 31:59.339
I can't be the only one who feels it.

31:59.340 --> 32:02.275
You are very beautiful,

32:02.276 --> 32:04.911
but be careful what you ask of me.

32:04.912 --> 32:07.547
I don't need money,
if that's what you mean.

32:07.548 --> 32:09.449
Money won't be a problem.

32:09.450 --> 32:11.451
- Because of this?
- My ring!

32:11.452 --> 32:14.387
- It never belonged to you!
- Mischa!

32:17.759 --> 32:19.526
Wise decision.

32:22.397 --> 32:25.132
- Where's your partner?
- What are you talking about?

32:25.133 --> 32:27.401
You're working with the
Bolshevik assassin, aren't you?

32:27.402 --> 32:29.536
Of course I'm not. I'm a Cossack!

32:29.537 --> 32:32.906
- Then who fired the shot?
- I don't know. I swear by it.

32:32.907 --> 32:36.243
Look, all I know is after it happened,

32:36.244 --> 32:39.579
I went to see Ana and she was
alone. She's never alone.

32:39.580 --> 32:41.715
And that gave you the perfect
opportunity to steal

32:41.716 --> 32:44.117
- the Ring of Rasputin.
- How could I not?

32:44.118 --> 32:46.219
If it really is the Ring of Rasputin,

32:46.220 --> 32:48.722
it would change my life.
I'd be a god on Earth.

32:48.723 --> 32:51.458
You don't seriously
believe that, do you?

32:51.459 --> 32:53.393
You aren't Russian.

32:53.394 --> 32:55.428
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

32:59.434 --> 33:02.736
It's such a relief to have it back.

33:02.737 --> 33:05.572
I felt its loss so strongly.

33:05.573 --> 33:08.008
Ana, this isn't over.

33:08.009 --> 33:10.644
Of course it is.
It was all about the ring.

33:10.645 --> 33:14.014
Mischa took advantage
of the distraction,

33:14.015 --> 33:16.850
but there's still a killer out
there who wants you dead.

33:16.851 --> 33:18.985
And he's not done trying.

33:18.986 --> 33:21.121
There's a way

33:21.122 --> 33:23.090
to stop all of this.

33:23.091 --> 33:25.759
What's this?

33:25.760 --> 33:27.894
Who you might really be.

33:31.532 --> 33:33.767
"Mona Gregorovich."

33:33.768 --> 33:36.536
I need some time to think.

33:44.011 --> 33:46.079
Frankie.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.715
My source at the ferry
dock came through.

33:48.716 --> 33:50.550
What have you got?

33:50.551 --> 33:53.053
Anton Andreevich's entry visa.

33:53.054 --> 33:55.555
It's got a picture of the man himself.

33:55.556 --> 33:58.125
Oh, my God. Sergei.

34:02.497 --> 34:04.564
Ana's vanished.
We can't find her anywhere.

34:04.565 --> 34:06.433
- Where's Sergei?
- Sergei?

34:06.434 --> 34:08.268
- He should be in his room. Why?
- His real name

34:08.268 --> 34:11.471
is Anton Andreevich.
He's the Bolshevik assassin.

34:15.409 --> 34:17.377
Oh, God!

34:20.947 --> 34:22.783
He's alive.

34:22.784 --> 34:24.951
If Sergei's the assassin,
then who stabbed him?

34:24.952 --> 34:27.254
And what happened to Ana?

34:35.532 --> 34:36.636
I heard a noise

34:36.637 --> 34:40.005
and went to investigate.
They ambushed me.

34:41.842 --> 34:44.277
I've searched the house.

34:44.277 --> 34:46.313
Ana's gone? We have to find her.

34:46.313 --> 34:48.748
Just drop the act.
I've seen your travel papers.

34:48.748 --> 34:51.284
I know your real name is Anton
Andreevich. You're a Bolshevik.

34:51.284 --> 34:54.754
I am a Cossack, sworn to
protect the Romanov family.

34:54.755 --> 34:57.757
I took the identity of a
Bolshevik to escape Russia.

34:57.758 --> 35:00.327
- Why go to New York?
- New York has

35:00.328 --> 35:02.796
so many Russian immigrants.
I wanted to be amongst my own.

35:02.797 --> 35:05.465
That's where I heard about Ana,
whose description

35:05.466 --> 35:08.034
- sounded like Anastasia.
- And if she

35:08.035 --> 35:10.837
- happened to still be alive...
- I needed to keep her safe

35:10.838 --> 35:12.973
until I could find out
if she really was,

35:12.974 --> 35:15.842
so I moved my troupe
from city to city.

35:15.843 --> 35:18.445
All right. Say I believed you.

35:18.446 --> 35:20.947
Who's the Bolshevik assassin?
Who stabbed you?

35:20.948 --> 35:23.717
I don't know.

35:23.718 --> 35:25.619
Well, it wasn't Mischa.
He only cares about the ring.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.687
And Sasha is in love with Ana.

35:27.688 --> 35:30.557
Sasha and Ana? I would
have never permitted that.

35:30.558 --> 35:32.492
Well, don't worry. It's over.

35:32.493 --> 35:35.128
Sasha said a man like him can
never be with a Romanov.

35:35.129 --> 35:37.030
"A man like him..."

35:37.031 --> 35:38.865
meaning a Bolshevik.

35:38.866 --> 35:40.700
Well, if I was a Bolshevik assassin

35:40.701 --> 35:42.669
with a Romanov princess,
where would I go?

35:42.670 --> 35:44.604
I know just the place.

35:50.645 --> 35:52.846
Ana! Thank God.

35:52.847 --> 35:54.748
- What are you doing here?
- We have to go.

35:54.749 --> 35:56.750
- Go? Why?
- Ana, you don't understand.

35:56.751 --> 35:59.186
It's Sasha.

35:59.187 --> 36:01.855
What about me?

36:01.856 --> 36:04.324
Sasha is a Bolshevik.

36:04.325 --> 36:06.426
He brought you here to kill you.

36:06.427 --> 36:09.262
No, he didn't! He brought
me here to marry me!

36:09.263 --> 36:11.765
We're waiting for a priest.
Aren't we, Sasha?

36:13.868 --> 36:16.069
Sasha?

36:16.070 --> 36:18.071
I'm sorry, Ana.

36:18.072 --> 36:20.207
I have no choice.

36:26.214 --> 36:29.416
Get out of my way.

36:29.417 --> 36:32.619
Move. Get out of my way
or I'll kill you too.

36:35.122 --> 36:37.123
You're not a killer, Sasha.

36:37.124 --> 36:39.226
That's why you sent

36:39.227 --> 36:41.695
the death threat, isn't it? So
you wouldn't have to kill Ana.

36:41.696 --> 36:45.799
I thought if she could
just stay Ana...

36:45.800 --> 36:48.134
perhaps I wouldn't have to do my duty.

36:48.135 --> 36:50.570
But you're a Cossack.
Your duty is to defend

36:50.571 --> 36:53.240
- the royal family.
- No. My father was a Cossack,

36:53.241 --> 36:55.809
and he was killed protecting
the Tsar and that institution

36:55.810 --> 36:58.211
- which was crumbling for years.
- So you joined the Bolsheviks.

36:58.212 --> 37:00.247
- His death was for nothing!
- Sasha, if you're

37:00.248 --> 37:02.215
going to kill anyone, it will be me.

37:02.216 --> 37:04.918
What are you waiting for?

37:04.919 --> 37:07.454
What if she's not Anastasia?

37:07.455 --> 37:09.162
You're willing to kill
the woman you love?

37:09.163 --> 37:10.423
Don't listen to their lies.

37:10.424 --> 37:13.693
I would have given it
all up for you, Sasha.

37:15.730 --> 37:17.797
I can be Mona Gregorovich

37:17.798 --> 37:19.899
if you want me to be.

37:19.900 --> 37:23.203
I'd renounce my lineage... for you.

37:26.440 --> 37:28.775
You'd do that for me?

37:34.982 --> 37:37.851
If you won't kill her, then I will!

37:40.488 --> 37:42.522
Trudy, get him!

37:44.659 --> 37:47.193
Sasha...

37:50.631 --> 37:53.633
- Sasha...
- I'm so sorry.

37:53.634 --> 37:55.769
Anastasia...

37:58.172 --> 38:01.741
No!

38:05.112 --> 38:08.081
So Trudy turned Alexei
over to the police.

38:08.082 --> 38:10.150
He'll be charged with Sasha's murder.

38:10.151 --> 38:12.218
You should get Ana

38:12.219 --> 38:14.187
to safety as soon as possible.

38:14.188 --> 38:16.690
We are traveling incognito
to Denmark tonight.

38:16.691 --> 38:19.492
She'll be reunited with
her aunt and grandmother.

38:19.493 --> 38:22.295
What if she isn't Anastasia?

38:22.296 --> 38:24.631
Then she'll know.

38:24.632 --> 38:27.667
Thank you for saving her life.

38:30.304 --> 38:32.305
I owe you my life,
Mrs. Winchester.

38:32.306 --> 38:35.575
The Romanov family is
forever in your debt.

38:35.576 --> 38:37.577
I was only doing

38:37.578 --> 38:39.646
what my father would have wanted.

38:39.647 --> 38:41.881
Whatever happens,

38:41.882 --> 38:43.883
I thank you both. I
suppose I will learn

38:43.884 --> 38:45.885
who I truly am once I
arrive in Denmark.

38:45.886 --> 38:48.588
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

38:48.589 --> 38:51.758
I did read Mona Gregorovich's story.

38:51.759 --> 38:54.894
It's like a Russian tragedy.

38:54.895 --> 38:57.263
I guess we'll never know
what happened to her.

38:57.264 --> 39:00.266
I'll walk you to the car.

39:13.948 --> 39:16.282
So is Mrs. Winchester gonna

39:16.283 --> 39:18.351
have to take inventory now
that you're out of her house?

39:18.352 --> 39:21.254
I will have you know that
pretty little mutt is a gift

39:21.255 --> 39:23.823
for the extraordinary
results of my tutelage.

39:23.824 --> 39:26.726
Faberge should stick to eggs.

39:26.727 --> 39:29.362
I wonder if I could pull
off a con like that.

39:29.363 --> 39:31.531
Dead royalty come back to life.

39:31.532 --> 39:33.533
You? Royalty?

39:33.534 --> 39:37.103
What?
I've got the accent down pat.

39:37.104 --> 39:40.640
Maybe here in the colonies,
but the minute you were around

39:40.641 --> 39:42.609
any royal relations, you'd be toast.

39:42.610 --> 39:44.110
I have a mind to take that bet.

39:44.111 --> 39:46.880
That's a sure win for me, but
then I'd spend all my winnings

39:46.881 --> 39:47.889
bailing you out of jail.

39:47.890 --> 39:49.949
Oh, aren't you sweet,
offering to bail me out.

39:49.950 --> 39:52.919
I'm gonna keep that in my back pocket
for the next time I'm in the soup!

39:52.920 --> 39:55.588
- Well, it wasn't an offer.
- Well, don't worry, doll face,

39:55.589 --> 39:57.590
because I've actually been
thinking, you know, that this

39:57.591 --> 39:59.252
makeover thing might
have legs. You know,

39:59.253 --> 40:00.660
going into the homes of the rich...

40:00.661 --> 40:03.396
- Casing them...
- I was gonna

40:03.397 --> 40:05.498
say "helping them!"

40:05.499 --> 40:07.333
Is that what you think of your mother?

40:07.334 --> 40:10.770
Well, it's why you come in
handy every now and again.

40:12.673 --> 40:15.442
Hmm. Do I?

40:22.516 --> 40:24.684
Another case solved?

40:24.685 --> 40:27.420
Another case over.

40:27.421 --> 40:30.390
I'm not sure that we
solved it, exactly.

40:34.995 --> 40:36.996
About that kiss, Hemy...

40:36.997 --> 40:40.266
Yes, about that. There's
something I need to tell you.

40:40.267 --> 40:43.536
I got a new gig.

40:43.537 --> 40:46.105
I'm moving to Paris to be a
correspondent for the Star.

40:46.106 --> 40:48.608
Paris, France

40:48.609 --> 40:50.310
or Paris, Ontario?

40:50.311 --> 40:52.479
I'll stay if you want me to.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.614
All you've wanted since
I've met you is to get out

40:54.615 --> 40:56.850
of this backwater town. Now you

40:56.851 --> 40:58.852
finally have your chance.

40:58.853 --> 41:02.021
I thought you might say that.

41:02.022 --> 41:03.690
I would ask you to come along...

41:03.691 --> 41:05.792
I like this backwater.

41:08.295 --> 41:11.531
Well, Frankie Drake, it's been...

41:11.532 --> 41:13.500
Shut up, Hemingway.

41:30.557 --> 41:32.892
Come on, black!

41:32.893 --> 41:35.661
Yes!

41:35.662 --> 41:38.331
Big winner!

41:38.332 --> 41:41.267
- Drinks on Flo.
- Hey, not that big.

41:41.268 --> 41:43.808
Oh, finally!

41:43.809 --> 41:46.711
Where have you been?

41:46.712 --> 41:48.980
Well, I had a couple days off,
so I went to New York.

41:48.981 --> 41:52.117
- New York? What for?
- I wanted to find out

41:52.118 --> 41:54.286
what really happened
to Mona Gregorovich.

41:54.287 --> 41:56.321
You went all the way to
New York for a case?

41:56.322 --> 41:59.057
Well, what else is there to do there?

41:59.058 --> 42:01.092
And besides, I wasn't going to give up

42:01.093 --> 42:03.828
until I got to the truth.

42:03.829 --> 42:05.931
So, I spoke with the nuns
directly at the church

42:05.932 --> 42:08.166
where Mona was cared for,
and it turns out Mona

42:08.167 --> 42:10.902
was there when the police
came looking for her!

42:10.903 --> 42:12.737
Wait, so the nuns were lying?

42:12.738 --> 42:14.839
Nobody better to protect
a secret than a nun.

42:14.840 --> 42:17.309
Well, they were afraid
her husband would try

42:17.310 --> 42:19.611
to come after her. Mona ended up

42:19.612 --> 42:22.213
joining the Order, and she
spent the rest of her days

42:22.214 --> 42:24.149
with the other nuns.
She even led the choir!

42:24.150 --> 42:27.686
- "The rest of her days"?
- She died about a year ago

42:27.687 --> 42:30.755
from tuberculosis. She's buried
in the church graveyard.

42:30.756 --> 42:33.758
Wait, so that means that Ana
can actually be Anastasia.

42:33.759 --> 42:35.694
Do you think it's possible?

42:35.695 --> 42:38.897
- Anything's possible.
- It would be very Russian.

42:38.898 --> 42:41.800
Speaking of Russian...

42:41.801 --> 42:44.169
The caviar!

42:44.170 --> 42:46.137
I couldn't let it go to waste.

42:46.138 --> 42:48.873
And...

42:48.874 --> 42:51.309
- OK!
- This is going to end badly.

42:51.310 --> 42:54.179
Where on earth did you find that?

42:54.180 --> 42:57.549
It was a going away
present from a friend.

42:57.550 --> 43:00.585
- A good friend?
- A very good friend.

43:03.022 --> 43:05.890
So... to Ana, to Mona,

43:05.891 --> 43:08.360
and maybe even to Anastasia.
