00:03.080 --> 00:05.071
I'm not a foodie.

00:05.240 --> 00:06.434
I don't:

00:06.600 --> 00:08.397
"Oh, this is too rare.
Oh, it's too salty."

00:09.880 --> 00:11.598
Just eat it and shut up.

00:11.760 --> 00:14.194
I'll eat anywhere,
whatever they're having.

00:14.360 --> 00:19.070
I've eaten rolls off of
room-service trays in hotel hallways.

00:19.240 --> 00:21.071
I have. That's not a joke.

00:21.240 --> 00:22.468
This is my life.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.719
I don't know, somebody left it.

00:25.880 --> 00:28.599
Why would somebody poison a roll
and leave it in the hallway...

00:28.760 --> 00:31.274
...for some comic coming down
at 2:00 in the morning?

00:31.480 --> 00:33.391
Why would they do that?

00:34.040 --> 00:37.271
Sometimes you go to a restaurant,
they put the check in a little book.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.159
What is this,
the story of the bill?

00:41.280 --> 00:45.353
"Once upon a time, there were some
very hungry people." What is this?

00:45.520 --> 00:48.671
Little gold tassel hanging down.
Am I graduating from the restaurant?

00:48.840 --> 00:50.398
What is this about?

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

00:59.640 --> 01:01.153
You want some of mine?

01:01.640 --> 01:04.916
- Take some of mine.
- Why do I get pesto?

01:05.080 --> 01:07.275
Why do I think I'll like it?

01:07.440 --> 01:08.998
I keep trying to like it.

01:09.160 --> 01:11.674
- Like I have to like it.
- Who said you have to like it?

01:11.840 --> 01:13.398
Everybody likes pesto.

01:13.560 --> 01:16.472
You walk into a restaurant,
that's all you hear. Pesto. Pesto.

01:16.760 --> 01:20.514
- I don't like pesto.
- Where was pesto 10 years ago?

01:22.160 --> 01:23.559
Look at that guy.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.116
I'll bet you he's getting
hair transplants.

01:29.360 --> 01:34.036
Anytime you see a guy that age
wearing a baseball cap, 10-1, plugs.

01:35.760 --> 01:39.196
The thing about that painting
is with the colours and...

01:39.600 --> 01:41.397
Oh, yeah, plugola.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.074
One more thing about the car.
Let it warm up for a minute.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.038
Yeah, that's a tough minute.

01:47.200 --> 01:50.556
It's like waiting in the shower
for the conditioner to work.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.631
I don't understand why
he couldn't take a cab.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.678
- Who?
- Elaine is having...

01:56.840 --> 01:58.239
...a houseguest.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.356
She's picking him up
at the airport tonight.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.557
- A guy?
- Yes, it's a guy.

02:03.720 --> 02:07.156
He's from Yakima, right?

02:07.800 --> 02:10.519
- Seattle.
- Everybody's moving to Seattle.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.518
It's the pesto of cities. So?

02:13.480 --> 02:14.674
Well, you tell.

02:15.040 --> 02:19.989
Well, from what I can piece together,
our friend here met a gentleman...

02:20.160 --> 02:22.196
- Ed.
- Who was in town...

02:22.360 --> 02:25.557
...on a business venture, and...?

02:25.720 --> 02:29.633
We shared
an interpersonal experience.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.631
- Go on.
- So they went out a few times...

02:34.120 --> 02:36.509
...but, apparently, when the fellow
returned home...

02:36.680 --> 02:40.514
...he discovered that the Benes tattoo
does not wash off so easily.

02:40.680 --> 02:43.035
On some people.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.597
So he's coming to stay with her
for a week.

02:45.760 --> 02:49.309
It was just gonna be a weekend,
but then, somehow, it became a week.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.993
- Wait a second.
- All right, okay.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.515
- All right, all right, okay.
- What happened?

02:56.680 --> 03:02.437
Oh, the busboy left the menu
a little close to the candle.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.953
I'm sorry for the disturbance.

03:04.520 --> 03:06.351
- I'm never eating here again.
- Yeah.

03:08.760 --> 03:10.273
- Nice going.
- Thank you.

03:10.880 --> 03:13.075
- That ought to get us a free dessert.
- Yeah.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.393
I think the busboy's in trouble.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.276
Did I get him in trouble
because of what I said?

03:20.440 --> 03:22.908
I just told him what happened.
He didn't do it on purpose.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.359
He pointed at me.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.353
- Why did they point at me?
- I said I would never eat here again...

03:28.520 --> 03:30.431
...but he had to know I was kidding.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.991
I didn't say anything.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.149
I can't believe it. He's going.
He's fired.

03:37.400 --> 03:41.598
- Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
- I didn't know he'd get fired.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.115
He'll probably kill his family
over this.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.591
What if he's waiting for me outside?

03:46.760 --> 03:48.432
He pointed at me.
Did you see him point?

03:48.600 --> 03:50.716
Lot of ex-cons become busboys.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.950
They seem to gravitate towards it.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.872
- Was it my fault?
- Was it my fault?

03:56.520 --> 03:58.397
Maybe I'll try that pesto.

04:01.440 --> 04:04.671
Look, I feel bad for him too,
but he'll get another job.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.957
Let's face it, it's not a profession
where you embellish your rásumá...

04:08.120 --> 04:11.157
...and undergo a series
of gruelling interviews.

04:13.160 --> 04:15.594
- Like you really know busboys.
- Oh, like you do.

04:15.760 --> 04:18.228
- Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.
- Camp.

04:18.399 --> 04:21.312
It was a fat camp.
Those kids depended on me.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.157
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.400
Busboys are always changing jobs.
That's the business.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.232
I know, I work with these guys.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.630
I talk with them in the kitchens
at the comedy clubs.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.313
Why don't you get him another job?

04:37.480 --> 04:39.914
I'd love to. But I don't know
anything about him.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.993
He could walk around the street
pricking people with pins.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.311
I don't know if you people
are aware of this...

04:49.480 --> 04:51.471
...but I am one clever chickadee.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.312
What, did you get
the busboy's number?

04:53.480 --> 04:56.836
His phone's been disconnected,
but I was able to obtain an address.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.151
1324 Amsterdam Avenue,
apartment 4D.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.071
Now, I did my job.

05:03.240 --> 05:06.437
- May I have the car keys, please?
- How did you get all this?

05:06.600 --> 05:09.478
Does the word "charm"
mean anything to you?

05:09.640 --> 05:10.914
No.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.228
Now you're going to his apartment?
I think this is nuts.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.234
I'd like to apologize. I wanna tell him
I didn't mean to get him in trouble.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.197
- So you're going now?
- Yeah.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.157
I'm gonna see if there's anything
I can do.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.390
Get him another job.
Maybe I'll hear of something.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.596
Maybe the fat camp.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.034
- You're not going?
- I would...

05:33.200 --> 05:35.316
...but I have to pick up Ed
at the airport.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.550
I just don't think
you should go alone.

05:37.720 --> 05:40.188
- Can't you wait till after my set?
- It will take too long.

05:40.360 --> 05:41.554
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.517
Take the K-Man.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.636
A little support.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.994
- I don't...
- What? What? Take me where?

05:49.160 --> 05:50.912
Where?

05:58.120 --> 06:00.475
Look, I really appreciate
your coming...

06:00.640 --> 06:03.996
...but if you wouldn't mind...

06:05.120 --> 06:07.031
...try not to say too much.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.078
What am I gonna say?

06:12.040 --> 06:13.553
I don't know.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.552
Well, I'm not an idiot.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.519
Certainly not.

06:20.360 --> 06:21.793
Then we're cool.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.479
Yeah.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.949
Yeah, we're cool.

06:41.160 --> 06:45.039
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was in the restaurant earlier...

06:45.200 --> 06:48.670
...and I was wondering if I could
talk to you about what happened.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.552
Thanks.

07:05.160 --> 07:08.630
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
It's just that...

07:08.800 --> 07:12.998
...I think I may have,
without realizing it...

07:13.640 --> 07:16.154
...been responsible
for getting you fired.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.079
And I just...

07:20.240 --> 07:23.994
I wanted you to know that I did
not intend for that to happen.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.279
He's a hell of a guy.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.319
This is...

07:29.960 --> 07:31.996
...a guy I know. Kramer.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.758
Oh, my God.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.832
Waterbed?

07:43.800 --> 07:45.677
Anyway, I...

07:45.840 --> 07:50.436
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm really sorry that happened.

07:50.600 --> 07:54.991
And if I can help out in any way,
I'll certainly be glad to do that.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.989
Well, I guess that's about it.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.431
You got anything to drink?

08:04.920 --> 08:07.559
- We really should be going.
- Let me get a glass of water.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.313
Hurry up.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.352
Paquita?

08:16.640 --> 08:18.278
Paquita?

08:26.200 --> 08:28.236
His cat's gone.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.399
Who left the door open?

08:57.160 --> 09:00.118
Who left the door open?

09:06.880 --> 09:09.872
Come on! Come on! Help me look!

09:26.560 --> 09:29.518
You know, the cats,
they run away all the time.

09:29.680 --> 09:33.878
You know, my aunt, she had a cat,
ran away, showed up three years later.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.712
You never know.

09:35.880 --> 09:38.917
They got things in their brains.
They remember where they're from.

09:40.640 --> 09:44.030
Unless somebody starts feeding her.
See, that's what you gotta worry about.

09:49.280 --> 09:52.955
Once again, Antonio,
I can't even begin to say...

09:53.120 --> 09:58.148
...how deeply, deeply sorry
I am about everything.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.154
The job...

10:00.320 --> 10:01.719
...the cat...

10:05.000 --> 10:06.274
The lamp.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.756
There's wire sticking out.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.553
Yeah.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.550
Here's my card.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.637
I'm in real estate.

10:29.800 --> 10:33.190
So if you're ever looking for
something bigger, something nicer...

10:34.760 --> 10:36.671
Maybe not right away.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.717
Anyway...

10:43.760 --> 10:45.990
You ought to get that wire fixed.

10:50.680 --> 10:52.432
I got the door.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.390
George, stop worrying about this guy.
It wasn't your fault.

11:02.560 --> 11:05.438
Come on. He's not stalking you.

11:06.560 --> 11:07.549
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:07.880 --> 11:10.075
He doesn't even know where you live.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.913
Who told you to give him
your business card?

11:14.160 --> 11:15.878
That's Elaine.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.632
Kramer.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.678
George wants to know when
you wanna go look for the cat again.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.991
Well, it's been a week.
It's up to the cat now.

11:26.440 --> 11:28.954
Kramer says it's up to the cat now.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.599
It'll be on your conscience.

11:30.920 --> 11:33.639
- Oh, how do you figure?
- How do you figure?

11:33.800 --> 11:35.392
You're the one who left
the door open.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.790
Why was I in charge
of closing the door?

11:37.960 --> 11:40.599
Why was he in charge
of closing the door?

11:40.760 --> 11:42.113
Because you came in after him.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.352
- So?
- So?

11:44.960 --> 11:47.474
- Last person in should close the door.
- Let me talk to him.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.710
Talk... Call him from your house.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.476
He's calling you now.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.119
Okay.

11:55.160 --> 11:56.957
Ed's downstairs.
Can I have the car keys?

11:58.480 --> 12:00.869
- No "hello"?
- You got any aspirin?

12:01.880 --> 12:03.154
Hello.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.719
Now, lookit, you guarantee me...

12:06.880 --> 12:09.792
...this car's gonna get me
to the airport tomorrow, no problem?

12:09.960 --> 12:12.030
Guarantee? Hey, it's a car.

12:12.200 --> 12:15.749
Because if there's even
the slightest chance of any problem...

12:15.920 --> 12:19.071
...I don't wanna take it. If I don't
get this guy on a plane to Seattle...

12:19.240 --> 12:23.916
...and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him
and anyone who tries to stop me.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.908
So did you have
a nice week together?

12:30.760 --> 12:33.479
I heard a little ping in the car last time.
What was that ping?

12:33.640 --> 12:35.995
There's no ping.
Why are you so wacky?

12:37.440 --> 12:40.750
Jerry, you cannot imagine
how much I hate this guy.

12:40.920 --> 12:44.037
And he hasn't even done anything.
It's this situation.

12:44.200 --> 12:47.397
He's a wonderful guy,
but I hate his guts.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.271
So have you two been...?

12:50.760 --> 12:52.239
No!

12:53.040 --> 12:56.794
I told him I've been having my period
the last five days.

12:56.960 --> 12:59.872
And I'm sleeping all squished
over on the edge of my bed.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.759
But I've only got 14 hours to go,
and nothing can go wrong now.

13:02.920 --> 13:05.912
I've taken care of everything.
I've confirmed the plane reservation...

13:06.080 --> 13:08.116
...checked weather...
- What's your airport route?

13:08.280 --> 13:10.350
I got it all mapped out.
I'm taking the tunnel.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.790
What about the Van Wyck?

13:13.600 --> 13:14.749
I spoke to a cab driver.

13:14.920 --> 13:18.913
For 5 bucks, he turned me onto
the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.

13:19.320 --> 13:22.232
Now look, his plane leaves at 10:15,
we're getting up at about 8.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.119
- Gives us enough time, right?
- You still using that alarm clock?

13:25.280 --> 13:27.953
No, I bought a new one today.
It's got everything.

13:28.120 --> 13:32.159
If you oversleep, a hand comes out
and slaps you in the face.

13:33.320 --> 13:36.357
Flying doesn't make me nervous.
Driving to the airport...

13:36.520 --> 13:39.080
...can make you very nervous.

13:39.240 --> 13:41.470
Because when you're flying,
getting on a plane...

13:41.640 --> 13:44.108
...if you miss that plane,
there's no alternative.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.599
On the ground, you have options.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.228
You have buses, you have taxis,
you have trains.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.392
But when you're taking a flight,
if you miss it, that's it.

13:51.560 --> 13:54.518
No airline goes, "Well, you missed
the flight. We do have a cannon...

13:54.680 --> 13:57.911
...leaving in 10 minutes.
Would you be interested in that?

13:58.080 --> 14:02.676
It's not a direct cannon. You have
to change cannons after you land."

14:04.520 --> 14:06.238
"Sir, where are you going,
Chicago?

14:09.400 --> 14:11.789
Oh, Dallas. All right. Wait a second.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.197
Dallas, that's about Dallas. Texas,
anyway. You should hit Texas. Ready?

14:16.680 --> 14:18.113
Get out of the net immediately...

14:18.280 --> 14:20.475
...because we shoot the luggage in
right after you."

14:30.440 --> 14:34.433
Get up. The alarm didn't go off.
You're gonna miss the plane, it's 9:15.

14:34.600 --> 14:38.195
- 9:15?
- Yeah. It's 9:15!

14:38.360 --> 14:40.078
We'll never make it.
I'll leave tomorrow.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.993
Tomorrow? Are you crazy?
No. Now, now, let's go.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.957
Let's go. You get dressed,
you get dressed.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.714
- Can I shower?
- Shower? Are you out of your mind?

14:47.880 --> 14:50.189
I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day.

14:50.360 --> 14:53.955
Forget the shower. The shower's out.
Just move it. Put your clothes on.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.239
- Where are you going?
- The kitchen.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.391
- The kitchen?
- Got a bag of cashews in there.

14:58.560 --> 15:01.358
No, they're not making it.
Here, put your pants on.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.238
- Put your pants on.
- What's the big deal?

15:03.400 --> 15:06.676
- I'll go tomorrow or the next day.
- No, you have your ticket.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.637
- You have to go now.
- We'll never make it.

15:09.280 --> 15:12.989
- Don't say that.
- Well, it takes 45 minutes to get...

15:13.440 --> 15:16.512
It takes 45 minutes to get there.
That will only leave me five minutes...

15:16.680 --> 15:18.750
...to get to the plane.
- Shut up and pack!

15:18.920 --> 15:21.992
And what if I don't make the plane?
You'll have left. Then what do I do?

15:22.160 --> 15:23.912
You're talking too much.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.071
- Where's my sweater?
- What?

15:26.280 --> 15:27.872
- My brown sweater.
- What sweater?

15:28.040 --> 15:30.270
- My brown sweater.
- You didn't bring a brown sweater.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.829
- I got a brown sweater.
- Here. You want a sweater?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.116
You want a brown sweater,
you got a brown sweater.

15:35.280 --> 15:38.477
- I can't take your sweater.
- It's brown!

15:40.200 --> 15:41.679
What are you doing?

15:41.840 --> 15:44.912
No. There's no time for folding,
no time for folding. I think that's it.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.833
- My shoes, you packed my shoes.
- Shoes? Shoes?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.230
Shoes weren't invented till
the fourth century.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.834
People walked around
for thousands of years without them!

15:53.000 --> 15:55.833
I have this! Let's go. Let's go.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.749
- Anywhere in the city?
- Anywhere in the city.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.717
I'll tell you the best public toilet.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.279
Okay...

16:05.440 --> 16:06.839
...54th and Sixth.

16:07.720 --> 16:10.075
Sperry-Rand building,
14th floor, Morgan Apparel.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.834
Mention my name,
she'll give you the key.

16:15.240 --> 16:18.277
All right, 65th and 10th.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.632
Are you kidding?

16:21.800 --> 16:24.553
Lincoln Center, Alice Tully Hall,
the Met.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.870
Magnificent facilities.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.039
I never knew I could drive like that.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.510
I was going faster
than I've ever gone before.

16:38.680 --> 16:41.672
And yet it all seemed
to be happening in slow motion.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.354
I was seeing three
and four moves ahead...

16:44.520 --> 16:49.469
...weaving in and out of lanes like an
Olympic skier on a gold-medal run.

16:50.280 --> 16:53.875
I knew I was challenging
the very laws of physics.

16:54.040 --> 16:57.112
At Queens Boulevard,
I took the shoulder.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.118
At Jewel Avenue, I used the median.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.716
I had it. I was there. And then...

17:05.240 --> 17:07.276
...I hit the Van Wyck.

17:08.440 --> 17:11.079
They say no one's ever beaten
the Van Wyck...

17:11.720 --> 17:15.234
...but, gentlemen, I tell you this:

17:15.880 --> 17:19.634
I came as close as anyone ever has.

17:21.359 --> 17:26.115
And if it hadn't been
for that five-car pileup...

17:26.280 --> 17:29.272
...on Rockaway Boulevard...

17:29.440 --> 17:32.193
...that numbskull...

17:32.360 --> 17:36.956
...would be on a plane
for Seattle right now...

17:37.120 --> 17:40.078
...instead of looking
for a parking space...

17:40.240 --> 17:42.435
...downstairs.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.833
- You did everything.
- You tried.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.194
The busboy's coming.

17:46.640 --> 17:50.030
- The busboy's coming.
- The busboy's coming?

17:50.200 --> 17:52.839
- You don't mean here.
- I buzzed him in. He's on his way up.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.797
He's coming up?
I'll check you out later.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.837
- Where are you going?
- I'm the one he wants.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.151
- He's coming to settle the score.
- No. You three all know each other.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.595
There's no point in me
getting involved at this stage.

18:02.760 --> 18:05.718
No, he's not gonna do anything.
I guarantee it.

18:05.880 --> 18:08.189
The hell with it! Let him kill me, l...

18:08.640 --> 18:11.393
Antonio! Antonio, in here.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.430
Hey, Antonio, how's it going?

18:17.640 --> 18:19.392
Three nights ago...

18:20.160 --> 18:23.630
...a gas main beneath
the restaurant exploded...

18:23.800 --> 18:26.598
...killing five people in my section...

18:26.760 --> 18:28.990
...including the busboy
who replaced me.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.954
If I'm not fired that night
because of you...

18:35.120 --> 18:38.590
...and your thoughtless,
stupid, insensitive remarks...

18:39.840 --> 18:41.319
...it would have been me.

18:44.240 --> 18:47.198
You saved my life!

18:49.560 --> 18:51.039
Come on.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.077
- Yeah?
- It's Eddie.

18:56.520 --> 18:59.432
- He's coming up.
- And the same night of the accident...

18:59.600 --> 19:01.431
...while looking for Paquita...

19:01.600 --> 19:03.830
...I find a job in a restaurant
where they pay me...

19:04.000 --> 19:06.036
...almost twice
what I was making before.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.913
And, when I returned
to the apartment...

19:10.080 --> 19:12.833
...Paquita, perhaps frightened
from the explosion...

19:13.160 --> 19:15.151
...had miraculously returned.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.594
Well...

19:18.760 --> 19:22.833
...now I must go, for today
I am starting my new, wonderful job...

19:23.000 --> 19:25.719
...and I am very late.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.159
Thank you.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.710
Thank you. Thank you all.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.758
Hey, watch where you're going.
You almost knocked my head off.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.831
Why don't you watch
where you're going, okay?

19:45.000 --> 19:48.390
- Because you bumped into me.
- Who do you think you're talking to?

19:48.560 --> 19:51.074
Hey, get your hands off me!

19:51.240 --> 19:52.639
You go to hell!

20:06.080 --> 20:07.593
He'll get another job.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.314
He's a busboy.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.272
It won't be for a while.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.237
At least not till after the cast
comes off.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.391
That fall down the stairs,
that's what did it.

20:15.560 --> 20:16.993
That's not how it happened.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.230
It's when he fell on him
with his knee.

20:19.400 --> 20:22.073
That was awful. Poor Antonio.

20:23.560 --> 20:24.754
Thanks.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.395
So, much longer?

20:27.840 --> 20:32.436
Till when? Till he goes back to Seattle
or till he can feed himself?

20:35.440 --> 20:37.158
I guess it's not important.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.596
Take care of yourselves.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.797
I should probably get going too.

20:45.960 --> 20:49.669
If I don't feed Paquita by 7,
she goes all over everything.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.792
Take it easy.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.313
Yeah.

20:56.360 --> 20:57.918
How you doing?

20:59.000 --> 21:02.913
First of all, I can't believe
that people actually do fight.

21:03.080 --> 21:05.878
People have fistfights in life.
I can't really believe...

21:06.040 --> 21:08.679
...that we have boxing, either.
It's really an amazing thing.

21:09.160 --> 21:11.720
The problem with boxing,
you have two guys having a fight...

21:11.880 --> 21:13.632
...that have no prior argument.

21:14.760 --> 21:17.593
Why don't they have the boxers
come into the ring in little cars...

21:17.760 --> 21:20.354
...drive around a bit,
have a little accident, they get out:

21:20.520 --> 21:22.590
"Didn't you see my signal?
Look at that fender!"

21:22.760 --> 21:24.432
Then you'd see a real fight.
