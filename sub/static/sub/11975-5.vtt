00:09.100 --> 00:12.100
All right, let's go.
Kanye is having his

00:12.100 --> 00:14.767
fashion show at Madison Square
Garden.

00:14.767 --> 00:16.767
It was really important for us
to invite Scott.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.100
I want him to feel like if he
needs to feel busy, that it's

00:19.100 --> 00:22.100
with us instead of resorting
back to unhealthy behavior.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.767
Did Scott tell you
he's not coming?

00:23.767 --> 00:26.100
No. He just said...
"I don't think so.

00:26.100 --> 00:29.433
I'm not making more drama and
want to be out of the press.

00:29.433 --> 00:34.100
It's just going to say me and
you are back."

00:42.833 --> 00:46.833
- Kimmy!
- Hello.

00:46.833 --> 00:48.833
There's Mama.
You look great, as usual, babe.

00:48.833 --> 00:50.567
I should stand on the
stair to...

00:50.567 --> 00:52.267
That's quite all
right. Even with the shoes on.

00:52.267 --> 00:53.867
- ...to give you a hug.
- Yeah.

00:53.867 --> 00:55.800
Do you like our new
house?

00:55.800 --> 00:57.667
- I just had to get out of Mom's.
- Yeah, being there

00:57.667 --> 00:59.000
with all the people and
everything.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.500
- It's insane.
- Yeah, that's kind of

01:00.500 --> 01:02.167
- how I felt.
- Yeah.

01:02.167 --> 01:05.500
Well, the reason I
came over, I saw something, and

01:05.500 --> 01:07.500
- I immediately thought of you.
- Yeah?

01:07.500 --> 01:09.200
You want to go see
it?

01:09.200 --> 01:10.867
Yeah, is it... it's
outside?

01:10.867 --> 01:12.867
- Okay, it's outside.
- Okay.

01:12.867 --> 01:15.533
You'll see why I

01:15.533 --> 01:17.533

- Okay.

01:17.533 --> 01:20.533
All right?

01:20.533 --> 01:23.533
Okay? The butt.

01:23.533 --> 01:25.333
Oh, my God.

01:25.333 --> 01:26.733
Someplace it's
going to fit.

01:26.733 --> 01:28.333
Is it, like, a credit
card swiper?

01:28.333 --> 01:29.767
Now wait a second.
I know.

01:29.767 --> 01:31.533
- That is so funny.
- And I thought of one

01:31.533 --> 01:33.533
other thing.
I could do this.

01:33.533 --> 01:36.533
I could have this mounted...
like, right there.

01:36.533 --> 01:38.533
Oh, so you brought a
wine glass with you.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.533
I brought a wine...
I didn't want to put it on

01:40.533 --> 01:43.233
- unless you would like it.
- I love this.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.567
That is amazing.
Oh.

01:45.567 --> 01:48.900
I think they need to shave off a
little bit of that vagina there.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.900
It's, like, halfway in-between.

01:51.900 --> 01:54.233
Yeah, I don't...
Uh, it kind of does, doesn't it?

01:54.233 --> 01:56.233
Well, that's kind of...
You know me, I don't know...

01:56.233 --> 02:00.233
But anyway, yeah.

02:00.233 --> 02:02.233
Maybe it's me.

I don't know, you know?
Uh... but...

02:03.900 --> 02:05.567

- Yeah.

Oh, my God, I can't cry
off all my makeup.

It is a super quick trip, but

everything in in one day and be

Karl Lagerfeld is a fashion
icon.

02:50.133 --> 02:53.800
He's the creator, director and
designer for Chanel and Fendi,

02:53.800 --> 02:57.133
and somebody I'd looked up to
since I was a teenager.

02:57.133 --> 02:58.800
- You look so good.
- Thank you.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.133
Yeah. Really good.
The first time I ever picked up

03:01.133 --> 03:03.800
a fashion magazine, I was
obsessed.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.800
I never thought that I would
ever have something beautiful

03:07.800 --> 03:12.467
that he designed, and now here I
am with Karl.

03:12.467 --> 03:14.800
Amazing.
Dream come true.

The energy is insane.
And I'm really excited about it

04:01.900 --> 04:04.567

tourist very often.

We're dead.

into 50 paparazzi and ruin an

I think everyone in my family
has thick skin, and everybody

04:30.933 --> 04:33.933
handles the paparazzi
differently, but Kendall's the

04:33.933 --> 04:36.600
one kid who's so sensitive
towards it.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.933
It really brings her down.
And I always feel so bad when

04:39.933 --> 04:43.267
she feels trapped.
But it's better to leave now

04:43.267 --> 04:46.267
before it gets too crazy.
Okay, well, take a deep breath

04:46.267 --> 04:48.933

- Um, no, but it should

05:05.767 --> 05:08.100

you guys have never really been

05:16.767 --> 05:19.100
doing what I'm doing with Kourt,
and, like, you know, she doesn't

05:19.100 --> 05:21.433

much.

05:21.433 --> 05:23.433

to dinner? Do you want...?"

Uh, she'd only say, "No."
'Cause she said...

overstepping my boundaries.

"Typical Scott who's partying
somewhere," but hearing that he

But you're not chasing

07:30.900 --> 07:34.233
lunch or this or that.
This is a complicated situation,

right now is, like, reassurance,

that he's a part of our family.

11:11.767 --> 11:15.100
And it doesn't make things
easier when we sit next to each

11:15.100 --> 11:17.767
other because I don't really
know how to act.

11:17.767 --> 11:20.767
I mean, when you've been with
somebody for ten, 11 years, and

11:20.767 --> 11:23.767
then all of a sudden you're not,
and you, like, can't touch them

11:23.767 --> 11:25.767
a certain way or talk to them a
certain way or look at them a

11:25.767 --> 11:27.767
certain way.
It's... it's a lot of things to

11:27.767 --> 11:29.767
- get used to.
- The food tastes the

11:29.767 --> 11:32.100
- best tonight.
- It does, right?

11:32.100 --> 11:34.767
- It's unbelievable.
- And guess what.

11:34.767 --> 11:38.433
Lamar, if you had not pulled
through your little thing, we'd

11:38.433 --> 11:42.133
be going to the  Lobster
once a month.

11:42.133 --> 11:46.800
So thank you for saving us from
that.

11:46.800 --> 11:50.800
I, like... I just
don't understand Scott's

11:50.800 --> 11:54.467
attitude right now.
I make an effort to have Scott

11:54.467 --> 11:57.800
here and be interactive with the
family, but instead of focusing

11:57.800 --> 12:00.467
on the positive, I feel like
he's just dwelling on this moody

12:00.467 --> 12:06.133
- negative space right now.
- What the?

12:06.133 --> 12:08.133
I know this guy who does
prosthetics.

12:08.133 --> 12:09.800
You could be whoever you want to
be.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.467
Yes. This is what I
need.

12:11.467 --> 12:13.467
I'm tired of not being able to
go out and just be, like, normal

12:13.467 --> 12:16.833
- for a second.
- This is what I dislike

12:16.833 --> 12:18.833
about Scott.
"I lost my family.

12:18.833 --> 12:27.100
You guys gave up on me."
How are you trying?

12:27.100 --> 12:30.433
If you had not pulled
through your little thing, we'd

12:30.433 --> 12:33.767
be going to the  Lobster
once a month.

12:33.767 --> 12:38.767
So thank you for saving us from
that.

12:38.767 --> 12:40.667
What the?

12:46.433 --> 12:49.467
- What's good?
- Nothing at all.

12:49.467 --> 12:52.467
- How's the new house?
- It's all right.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.467
You been sleeping all
right?

12:54.467 --> 12:56.467
Yeah, that's all I've
been doing.

12:56.467 --> 12:58.467
- That's good.
- Yeah.

12:58.467 --> 13:00.467
I was super scared
when I came and saw you in the

13:00.467 --> 13:02.800
hospital.
You remember everything?

13:02.800 --> 13:06.467
Yeah.
I can remember being scared, uh,

13:06.467 --> 13:09.467
- half to death.
- Man.

13:09.467 --> 13:11.467
I couldn't handle it.
I left.

13:11.467 --> 13:15.800
I was like, "I can't... I can't
see this man like this."

13:15.800 --> 13:20.133
I just felt like you were just
dying, like, to talk, but you

13:20.133 --> 13:22.167
couldn't, and, like, you didn't
know what to d...

13:22.167 --> 13:24.500
I was like...
I was, I was trapped

13:24.500 --> 13:28.833
in that... in my body.
Couldn't even say "excuse me" or

13:28.833 --> 13:33.167
"thank you."♪ ♪

13:33.167 --> 13:35.167
So, like, how do you
feel now?

13:35.167 --> 13:37.167
- Any, like...?
- Taking it day by day.

13:37.167 --> 13:38.833
Thank God you're all
right.

13:38.833 --> 13:40.833
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:40.833 --> 13:42.833
- Trust me, I get it.
- Yeah.

13:42.833 --> 13:45.167
I've been there.
You know, I was in rehab for a

13:45.167 --> 13:47.167
- while.
- Yeah.

13:47.167 --> 13:49.167
Like, I didn't have
contact with, like, the world or

13:49.167 --> 13:51.167
whatever.
Now you got somebody at the

13:51.167 --> 13:52.833
house; somebody's always, like,
watching.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.500
- Yeah.
- It's a blessing.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.200
Yeah.♪ ♪

13:57.200 --> 14:00.033
When I first heard
about what happened to Lamar, I

14:00.033 --> 14:03.667
mean, it was heartbreaking.
And it didn't seem like he was

14:03.667 --> 14:06.200
gonna be able to turn his life
around and come back, and now

14:06.200 --> 14:08.867
that he is, it's, like... it's a
miracle.

14:08.867 --> 14:11.033
He's got, like, another chance
at life, so it's pretty

14:11.033 --> 14:13.367
unbelievable, and it's pretty
unreal that everybody, you know,

14:13.367 --> 14:16.167
stuck beside him and was there
for him.

14:16.167 --> 14:18.267
You ain't calling any of your
old friends?

14:18.267 --> 14:20.700
- Nah.
- That's the hardest

14:20.700 --> 14:23.200
part, just getting rid of all
the bad people, you know what I

14:23.200 --> 14:25.100
- mean?
- Yeah. I mean, I can't

14:25.100 --> 14:28.433
really take the risk, you know
what I'm saying?

14:28.433 --> 14:30.900
I can't do... do that to that
girl, you know, man?

14:30.900 --> 14:34.900
Yeah.
It's scary, man.

14:34.900 --> 14:38.100
Yeah.

14:46.533 --> 14:48.667
Oh, I  hate
belly buttons.

14:48.667 --> 14:50.300
They're super weird.
Like, when I have to...

14:50.300 --> 14:51.700
- I hate belly buttons.
- ...like, scrub my

14:51.700 --> 14:53.433
spray tan out of my belly
button.

14:53.433 --> 14:54.933
Oh, that just freaks
me out.

14:54.933 --> 14:58.000
So... I went out with

14:58.000 --> 15:00.633
Kourtney last night and it
was a mess.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.533
I'm over not being able to go
out and just be, like, normal

15:03.533 --> 15:05.800
- for a second. You know?
Mm-hmm.

15:05.800 --> 15:08.000
Life is life, but
sometimes I just want to be a

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
- kid.
- I feel ya.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.300
I just can't remember
what it's like to go out and

15:13.300 --> 15:15.767
- nobody know who I am.
- Trust me, you're gonna

15:15.767 --> 15:17.767
hate it.

15:17.767 --> 15:21.633
Literally, the last time I've
been to a mall has been years.

15:21.633 --> 15:24.000
Can't tell you.
Like, I would love to go to the

15:24.000 --> 15:25.500
normal mall, like, go to the
food court.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.500
- Walk around, yeah.
- Like, that's what I

15:27.500 --> 15:29.567
used to do.
So I totally get it.

15:29.567 --> 15:31.567
- Yeah.
- I definitely

15:31.567 --> 15:33.933
sympathize with Kendall and
Kylie that they've never truly

15:33.933 --> 15:38.067
experienced probably a normal
teenage life.

15:38.067 --> 15:41.867
But they have incredible
opportunity and so many perks,

15:41.867 --> 15:45.533
and it's a gift and a curse no
matter which way you look at it.

15:45.533 --> 15:49.067
So I wish there was something I
can do to help them.

15:49.067 --> 15:54.133
Okay, so, there's this guy who
does crazy prosthetics, like,

15:54.133 --> 15:56.133
- movie prosthetics, like...
- I've always wanted to

15:56.133 --> 15:57.800
- do that.
- ...the Grinch-- like,

15:57.800 --> 15:59.300
you could be whoever you want to
be, literally.

15:59.300 --> 16:01.733
- Yes.
- Do you want a big ass?

16:01.733 --> 16:05.200
Do you want to look pregnant?
Do you want to be a fat person?

16:05.200 --> 16:07.200
- This is what I need.
- Yeah. I just...

16:07.200 --> 16:09.800
To prosthetic it up
and go out.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.867
I was kind of joking
about doing prosthetics.

16:12.867 --> 16:15.833
I didn't realize, you know, how
into it Kylie was gonna be.

16:15.833 --> 16:17.833
What if we did those
Hollywood tours?

16:17.833 --> 16:21.000
Are you kidding?
That's something you want to do?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.367
- the Hollywood tour.
- I know, but, like, I

16:23.367 --> 16:25.700
wonder what they say, like, how
they talk about us, like how

16:25.700 --> 16:27.933
- they make us seem.
- Okay, if that's

16:27.933 --> 16:30.167
something you want to do, I
won't discredit you.

16:30.167 --> 16:33.167
We'll go on the Hollywood tour.
Now that she's into it, I mean,

16:33.167 --> 16:36.433
let's do this and have fun.

16:36.433 --> 16:39.000
- Hey.
- Hey. So, Kylie and I

16:39.000 --> 16:43.533
were talking about, um... she
just wishes that she could,

16:43.533 --> 16:45.700
- like, just live a normal life.
Mm-hmm.

16:45.700 --> 16:49.567
So I know this guy who
does dope-ass prosthetics, like,

16:49.567 --> 16:52.767
for movies, and, like,
literally, like, you will look

16:52.767 --> 16:54.867
completely different.
There's no way someone can know

16:54.867 --> 16:56.367
- who you are.
- Oh, damn.

16:56.367 --> 16:58.367
We're gonna have the
best time of our lives.

16:58.367 --> 17:00.833
As long as we take a
random car.

17:00.833 --> 17:03.433
Wear something very,
like, basic.

17:03.433 --> 17:05.533
Basic.
I know you know what it's like

17:05.533 --> 17:08.167
- to be basic.
- Thank you.

17:08.167 --> 17:11.633
I'm just kidding.

17:18.433 --> 17:20.767
We're about to take
down.

17:20.767 --> 17:25.700
Wow. I love it.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.733
- Are you starving?
- I'm starved.

17:27.733 --> 17:29.933
- Are y'all ready for wine?
- Well, you are.

17:29.933 --> 17:32.200
Yeah, but you're not.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.200
- Thank you.
- So, I want to bounce

17:34.200 --> 17:36.200
something off of you.
Tell me what you think.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.500
I have been thinking about,
like, fun dates, like, back to

17:38.500 --> 17:42.167
your roots of fun, not, like, we
just go do this luxurious and

17:42.167 --> 17:45.633
romantic-- that's easy.
I'm gonna take us skating.

17:45.633 --> 17:49.900
Ice-skating?
- No. Roller-skating.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.900
No, we ice-skate.
skating.

17:51.900 --> 17:55.300
In my community, there was no
ice-skating and all that.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.567
We just... Four wheels.
Eight total.

17:58.567 --> 18:02.433
- And you did your thing.
- Not romantic.

18:02.433 --> 18:04.600
- romantic.
- No, ice-skating.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.600
You're from La Jolla.

18:06.600 --> 18:10.533
I see roller-skating as
romantic, actually.

18:10.533 --> 18:14.833
Corey is wanting to
roller-skate, but because I had

18:14.833 --> 18:19.267
knee surgery years ago, the last
thing I want to do is reinjure

18:19.267 --> 18:22.300
my knee.
So I'm really not a big fan.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.800
Well, good luck with
that.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.867
No, it's gonna happen.
I want to take her...

18:25.867 --> 18:27.367
- Thanks, Mom.
- See where that'll get

18:27.367 --> 18:29.567
- you.
- No, it's gonna get me

18:29.567 --> 18:31.567
to the next level of love, I
promise you.

18:31.567 --> 18:34.667
Yeah, I know.

18:42.600 --> 18:46.367
Khloe, how many
pillows do you need on your bed?

18:46.367 --> 18:50.067
I'm very confused by this.
Can I take a photo?

18:50.067 --> 18:52.100
How does it
inconvenience your life?

18:52.100 --> 18:54.533
- Taking a photo for what?
- I'm gonna post it.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.067
- Kourt!
- How many pillows...

18:56.067 --> 18:57.567
How many should I
have?

18:57.567 --> 18:59.567
No, no, no.
How many pillows do you sleep

18:59.567 --> 19:01.567
- with?
- All of those.

19:01.567 --> 19:03.867
Oh, my God, you
have so many pillows.

19:03.867 --> 19:05.867
- Oh, shut up.
- That's what I just

19:05.867 --> 19:08.133
said!

19:08.133 --> 19:10.600
- Oh. This isn't real.
- I saw that.

19:10.600 --> 19:13.233
He has an appearance in Vegas
today.

19:13.233 --> 19:15.867
This is what I really
dislike about Scott.

19:15.867 --> 19:19.067
So, like, the Armenian dinner
for Dad's birthday.

19:19.067 --> 19:22.033
- Hi.
- Moping.

19:22.033 --> 19:26.733
The most negative,
depressed victim.

19:26.733 --> 19:30.767
He acts like he tries so hard to
actually play it straight for

19:30.767 --> 19:33.567
even a month, but, like, he
comes and plays this victim--

19:33.567 --> 19:36.000
"I lost my family.
You guys gave up on me."

19:36.000 --> 19:38.367
How are you trying?
I was like, "Scott, I'm gonna

19:38.367 --> 19:40.800
punch you in your
jugular, because of your

19:40.800 --> 19:43.000
depressed, negative energy."
Maybe he's

19:43.000 --> 19:45.533
- depressed.
- No, but...

19:45.533 --> 19:47.533
I-I don't like it.
- He's not making an

19:47.533 --> 19:50.600
effort whatsoever to come to
Mom's, the little smirk on his

19:50.600 --> 19:52.867
- face.
- I said he's like,

19:52.867 --> 19:55.467
"I lost my whole family, I don't
have any siblings."

19:55.467 --> 19:58.100
I go, "You do.
You have all my family members.

19:58.100 --> 20:00.700
No one's ditching you.
They just get frustrated with

20:00.700 --> 20:02.900
you, because you..."
I text him all the

20:02.900 --> 20:05.367
time, he doesn't respond back.
"Oh, I forgot, I'm just not in a

20:05.367 --> 20:07.733
good place."
And then I talk, and the same

20:07.733 --> 20:10.000
conversation.
"What can I do to get Kourt

20:10.000 --> 20:11.633
back?"
I go, "Scott, you're not trying

20:11.633 --> 20:13.767
at all."
Yeah.

20:13.767 --> 20:16.133
I totally get that
Kourtney and Scott's

20:16.133 --> 20:18.833
relationship is a work in
progress, but Scott needs to be

20:18.833 --> 20:22.300
more accountable.
He tends to shift the blame all

20:22.300 --> 20:24.733
the time.
And if you want a relationship

20:24.733 --> 20:27.167
with us and if you want a
relationship with this family,

20:27.167 --> 20:29.067
you have to try as well.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.567
Look at her nose!
Kylie!

20:37.567 --> 20:40.600
I am super excited to do
prosthetics.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.267
I'm your grandmother,
and you guys are my  up

20:43.267 --> 20:46.400
grandchildren.
I want you to be around, I want

20:46.400 --> 20:49.000
to always invite you and have
you at things, but I felt like

20:49.000 --> 20:56.233
someone, like, held a gun to
your head to be there.

21:01.367 --> 21:03.433
- Whoa.
- I know, right?

21:03.433 --> 21:05.000
So you were thinking
about being a redhead?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.433
- Yeah.
- Kind of nerdy, with

21:07.433 --> 21:09.633
- some freckles?
- Yeah. And pregnant.

21:09.633 --> 21:11.200
Would you like to try
on a pregnancy belly?

21:11.200 --> 21:14.567
- Sure.
- Today Kendall and

21:14.567 --> 21:17.600
Kylie and I are getting fitted
for the molds for our face so we

21:17.600 --> 21:20.500
can go completely undercover and
nobody will recognize us

21:20.500 --> 21:22.500
tomorrow.
It's just gonna be such an

21:22.500 --> 21:24.500
experience, and we're never
gonna forget it.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.367
I think this is a
good look for you.

21:26.367 --> 21:28.067
I should get, like,
a tramp stamp and, like, put,

21:28.067 --> 21:30.033
- like, a big...
- But who's gonna see

21:30.033 --> 21:31.467
- your...
- I'll wear a crop

21:31.467 --> 21:33.467
- top.
- As a pregnant person?

21:33.467 --> 21:35.767
- Yeah.
- I want to be, like, an

21:35.767 --> 21:38.700
old lady, so I heard that's,
like, a big deal.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.800
Age makeup, so it's,
like, it's a little bit

21:40.800 --> 21:43.167
more complicated.
To do that, we would need to

21:43.167 --> 21:45.567
lifecast your whole face and
your neck as well.

21:45.567 --> 21:47.067
- Okay.
- Because we can get

21:47.067 --> 21:49.500
- that little neck wattle.
- Oh.

21:49.500 --> 21:53.333
Everything that I laser away.
The only way that Kendall and

21:53.333 --> 21:57.167
Kylie will actually really get
to know what it's like to live a

21:57.167 --> 22:01.767
normal life and go unnoticed and
under the radar is if they...

22:01.767 --> 22:03.933
fully transform into somebody
else.

22:03.933 --> 22:06.033
And, of course, I don't want
Kendall and Kylie to do this

22:06.033 --> 22:08.033
alone.
I want to try this.

22:08.033 --> 22:10.267
I am a big kid at heart.
I want to have fun.

22:10.267 --> 22:12.833
Okay, I'm gonna not be able to
talk to you soon.

22:12.833 --> 22:15.000
- Better enjoy this.
- Khlo, I'm gonna

22:15.000 --> 22:18.433
take a pic.
Eyebrows on fleek.

22:18.433 --> 22:20.967
- Oh, hi.
- Oh, I'm gonna have an

22:20.967 --> 22:22.967
anxiety attack.
I don't know if I can do this.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.967
We're not
covering your whole head.

22:24.967 --> 22:27.800
What do you feel, like, you
missed out on, like, in your

22:27.800 --> 22:30.633
- childhood? You just feel like...
- I missed out on being

22:30.633 --> 22:32.700
normal.
Being able to feel like I can,

22:32.700 --> 22:34.800
like, get out of the car and
nobody's staring at me.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.467
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah. Yeah.

22:36.467 --> 22:39.000
That's what I missed
out on.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.500
Totally.
I realize that it is kind of

22:41.500 --> 22:44.200
crazy that we have to go through
all of this just to go out and

22:44.200 --> 22:47.967
be normal, but it's worth it, I
think. I hope.

22:47.967 --> 22:51.733
Here we go.
So, what we'll do is fill it

22:51.733 --> 22:54.667
with a stone material,
and then we have a complete,

22:54.667 --> 22:59.633
- perfect copy of your face.
- Ooh. Awesome.

22:59.633 --> 23:01.900
- Kourt, where's my cool pictures?
- You really are a ge...

23:01.900 --> 23:03.700
Like, I'm really impressed right
now.

23:03.700 --> 23:05.833
I didn't want to
say it during, but I would have

23:05.833 --> 23:08.933
- been so claustrophobic.
- That looks very scary.

23:08.933 --> 23:13.500
Yep.♪ ♪

23:13.500 --> 23:14.833

- Yeah.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.467
So, you were pretty
down the other day.

23:27.467 --> 23:29.467
I mean, I feel like I
always have ups and downs, you

23:29.467 --> 23:31.467
know what I mean?
That's what kind of sucks about

23:31.467 --> 23:33.467
me-- it's like one day I feel
good, one day I feel bad, and

23:33.467 --> 23:36.833
- it's, like, it's tough.
- But then, like, you,

23:36.833 --> 23:39.433
like, it's, like, oh, you're not
around and you get sad, so,

23:39.433 --> 23:41.433
like, we invite you around, and
I felt like you... it was almost

23:41.433 --> 23:44.300
like I felt like someone,
like, held a gun to your head to

23:44.300 --> 23:47.267

We want you to come around us

have your own life and be

23:51.267 --> 23:55.600
separated, then that's fine,
too.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.433
I really thought this was my
real neck, Kendall, and I almost

23:58.433 --> 24:00.567
- spiraled.
- Khloe's look is so

24:00.567 --> 24:03.600
ridiculous.
She looks so legit.

24:03.600 --> 24:06.600
I heard you didn't want

24:06.600 --> 24:09.700
- to go roller-skating.
- I'm 60 years old.

24:09.700 --> 24:12.167
- What if I break my arm?
- The point is, it's just

24:12.167 --> 24:19.167
like doing something that Corey
really loves.

Hearing Khloe tell me that she

is inviting me because they want
me there, it does make me

of pity and... it is truthful.

not together doesn't mean all

25:27.067 --> 25:29.967
friendships are broken.
I mean, Khloe and I were, like,

25:29.967 --> 25:32.067
as close as you could be-- I
mean, she was basically like a

25:32.067 --> 25:34.367
best friend to me.
And I realize that we still have

25:34.367 --> 25:37.133
that.
I'd rather be there and, like,

25:37.133 --> 25:41.033
have that little bit of sadness
than not be there at all.

25:41.033 --> 25:43.500
- Right.
- I moved into the same

25:43.500 --> 25:46.400
neighborhood to be close to your
mom. Like... you know?

25:46.400 --> 25:48.067
- Yeah.
- I could live in

25:48.067 --> 25:50.533
Beverly Hills, but I was, like,
I want to be close to the kids

25:50.533 --> 25:52.867

- Well, I'm proud of

over here, and... I love you.

the lump?

26:17.367 --> 26:20.133
Um, we have two nose
options for you, so either one

26:20.133 --> 26:22.533
- of those noses.
- Can she not talk?

26:22.533 --> 26:24.967
- Oh, she can talk. Yeah.
- Hi, Kyles.

26:24.967 --> 26:27.033
Are you excited for
this?

26:27.033 --> 26:29.033
Mm-hmm.
- Khloe, this

26:29.033 --> 26:31.200
- is so great.
- I have no idea what I

26:31.200 --> 26:33.200
look like.
I really thought this was my

26:33.200 --> 26:34.700
real neck, Kendall, and I almost

I was like... that cannot be my

26:37.400 --> 26:40.133
- real neck.
- I am super excited

26:40.133 --> 26:43.233
to do prosthetics.
I think it's such a funny idea,

26:43.233 --> 26:46.067
and I think we can have so much
fun with it if we play it right.

26:46.067 --> 26:48.200
We're gonna look so random.
Are we gonna be, like, the

26:48.200 --> 26:51.533
two... god... granddaughters of
Khloe?

- And you guys are my  up

26:54.633 --> 26:56.867
grandchildren.

26:56.867 --> 26:58.900
Guys, we have to also think of
our names.

26:58.900 --> 27:01.533
- My name is Lulu.
- Your name should be

27:01.533 --> 27:03.200
Dolores.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.200
- Grandma Dolores.
- Take this...

27:05.200 --> 27:06.600
- There you go.
- Khloe.

27:06.600 --> 27:09.400
Like, look
at her baggy cheeks.

27:09.400 --> 27:13.933
Look at her nose! Kylie!
nose.

27:13.933 --> 27:16.133
- Khloe!
- I was just gonna say

27:16.133 --> 27:18.133
you shouldn't be talking about
me.

27:18.133 --> 27:20.100
Khloe's look is so

27:20.100 --> 27:23.933
ridiculous.
She looks so legit and real.

27:23.933 --> 27:25.967
Khloe, what's your old woman
voice?

27:25.967 --> 27:28.400
Dolores? Dolores?

27:28.400 --> 27:32.967
I got to be settled now.

27:32.967 --> 27:36.533
I was under the impression that
all three of us were doing a

27:36.533 --> 27:40.467
complete transformation.
Like, I literally have fake

27:40.467 --> 27:45.267
eyebrows, fake forehead, nose,
cheeks, jowls, and Kendall and

27:45.267 --> 27:50.167
Kylie have fake noses and ears.
I feel like I'm the only one

27:50.167 --> 27:53.767
doing a complete transformation.
Maybe I'm just jealous.

27:53.767 --> 27:56.467
I don't want to be the old lady.
Man, this is tough.

27:56.467 --> 27:58.567
I feel like we all
look so different.

27:58.567 --> 28:00.833
You don't have any
bras that would fit me.

28:00.833 --> 28:02.833
No, I wouldn't.
You don't need a bra, though.

28:02.833 --> 28:04.833
Oh, so grandmas just
show their nipples now?

28:04.833 --> 28:06.833
Yes, Khloe.

28:11.367 --> 28:14.800
- What's all this art?
- Um, I bought the little

28:14.800 --> 28:17.833
drum table, and I want to put a
piece of glass on the little

28:17.833 --> 28:21.067
table.
Would you do a one-inch bevel,

28:21.067 --> 28:23.633
or would you do the
quarter-inch bevel around the

28:23.633 --> 28:26.567
glass that was done in that
period?

28:26.567 --> 28:28.900
- Probably that period.
- Yeah.

28:28.900 --> 28:31.333
I heard you didn't want
to go roller-skating.

28:31.333 --> 28:34.567
- Yeah, why is that?
- I'm 60 years old.

28:34.567 --> 28:37.333
- Yeah.
- I've had knee surgery.

28:37.333 --> 28:41.067
And I'm a grandma.
And I don't think grandmas

28:41.067 --> 28:43.133
- should be roller-skating.
- I think it will be

28:43.133 --> 28:45.433
- good exercise.
- What if I break my arm?

28:45.433 --> 28:47.933
Do you remember when Khloe was
Rollerblading when she was

28:47.933 --> 28:50.433
little, and she broke her arm?
That could happen to me, your

28:50.433 --> 28:52.733
- mother.
- That is not gonna

28:52.733 --> 28:54.833
happen to you, 'cause you know
how to ski and you know how to

28:54.833 --> 28:56.867
ice-skate.
You will not fall.

28:56.867 --> 28:58.867
I don't have any
skates.

28:58.867 --> 29:01.033
- I do not have skates.
- You rent them there.

29:01.033 --> 29:03.033
No, no, no, no.
I'm getting her crispy,

29:03.033 --> 29:05.533
brand-new, black-on-black speed
skates.

29:05.533 --> 29:07.533
"Speed skates"?!
You're getting a little carried

29:07.533 --> 29:09.533
- away.
- You're gonna like it.

29:09.533 --> 29:12.100
- And I don't... okay.
- Stop, stop a minute.

29:12.100 --> 29:15.100
My mom and Corey's
relationship is definitely,

29:15.100 --> 29:18.233
like, 90% what my mom wants to
do, and Corey's so easy and just

29:18.233 --> 29:21.533
goes with the flow.
But she never really bends for

29:21.533 --> 29:25.000
him, and I feel like we all need
to nudge her sometimes, and just

29:25.000 --> 29:28.033
be like, "You've got to do this
for your man."

29:28.033 --> 29:30.233
- I don't have a...
-  Stop, stop!

29:30.233 --> 29:32.233
Stop, stop, stop...

29:32.233 --> 29:35.600
I can't even take this
anymore.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.700
Kim Kardashian's
favorite place...

29:37.700 --> 29:39.767

The Kartrashians?

29:39.767 --> 29:41.667
Khloe, run!

29:45.133 --> 29:47.133
You're getting a little
carried away.

29:47.133 --> 29:49.133
- You're gonna like it.
- And I don't... okay.

29:49.133 --> 29:51.367
- Stop, stop a minute.
- I don't have a...

29:51.367 --> 29:53.833
- Stop, stop.
- Stop, stop, stop.

29:53.833 --> 29:56.233
I can't even take this
anymore.

29:56.233 --> 29:58.767
I mean, the point is,
it's just like doing something

29:58.767 --> 30:02.300
- that Corey really loves.
- How about that?

30:02.300 --> 30:06.200
- You'll be fine.
- I will go roller-

30:06.200 --> 30:09.100
skating with you guys.
And I'll go dip my toe in the

30:09.100 --> 30:12.833
water.... because it's something
you like to do, and then I'll

30:12.833 --> 30:15.100
watch you guys skate.
How about that?

30:15.100 --> 30:17.667
- Yeah, just compromise.
- And I'm gonna laugh a

30:17.667 --> 30:20.467
lot if you don't get off the
floor, and you have more fun

30:20.467 --> 30:23.000
than the kids.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
- Well, I'll go.
- Thank you.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.133
- All right.
- Love you, Kris.

30:27.133 --> 30:29.233
Oh, love you, too,
babe.

30:37.600 --> 30:40.033
Kids these days

30:40.033 --> 30:42.567
are just fast.
I'm like a... I'm a turtle.

30:42.567 --> 30:44.567
What if someone
knows us?

30:44.567 --> 30:46.567
Like, "Are you Kylie Jenner?"
Be like, "Oh, my

30:46.567 --> 30:48.567
God, no, no..."
Say, "Oh, my God, I

30:48.567 --> 30:50.567
get that all the time!"
I-I get that all the

30:50.567 --> 30:52.567
- time.
- And that is such a

30:52.567 --> 30:54.567
compliment, though.
Hold on, y'all, your grandma

30:54.567 --> 30:56.567
is coming!
My name is Dolores, but you can

30:56.567 --> 30:59.733
call me Dottie.
You know I got a bad hip.

30:59.733 --> 31:03.000
I was born in 1937.
I'm not good at math, so I have

31:03.000 --> 31:06.167
no idea how old I am.
And I have two grandchildren.

31:06.167 --> 31:08.200
- Can't remember their names.
- Do you want me to

31:08.200 --> 31:10.233
- drive?
- Yes, you know I can't

31:10.233 --> 31:12.467
- drive with my hip.
- Kendall and I are Sam

31:12.467 --> 31:16.167
and Natalie Johnson from
Albuquerque.

31:16.167 --> 31:18.600
Natalie, you are just
the sweetest little soul.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.633
We rented a car.
We have our accents.

31:21.633 --> 31:25.100
- We're about to do this.
- Oh, my God, hold on.

31:25.100 --> 31:28.700
Hold on, hold on.
I'm coming!

31:28.700 --> 31:30.700
I'm coming!
I hope you don't go into labor,

31:30.700 --> 31:32.700
- though.
- I know.

31:32.700 --> 31:34.700
I'm only seven months, though,
so if I go into labor any time

31:34.700 --> 31:36.700
- soon...
- Then that baby's

31:36.700 --> 31:38.700
Yeah.

31:38.700 --> 31:40.700
Yeah, that's gonna be
real ugly, though.

31:40.700 --> 31:42.700
Ooh, this thing is
speedy. Such a blessing to be in

31:42.700 --> 31:44.867
Los Angeles, California.

31:44.867 --> 31:46.967
Lammy, Lammy, it's
Khloe.

31:46.967 --> 31:49.800
Look at us.

31:49.800 --> 31:53.933
- It's Kylie and it's Kendall.
- I look like...

31:53.933 --> 31:56.400
What the  you
got on your face?

31:56.400 --> 31:58.933
Lammy!
Why does your face look so

31:58.933 --> 32:01.333
- disturbed?
- 'Cause you look

32:01.333 --> 32:03.333
- up.
- Do you think I look

32:03.333 --> 32:05.333
- pretty?
- Pretty ugly.

32:05.333 --> 32:07.333
- Thanks.
- I could not tell it

32:07.333 --> 32:09.333
- was you, girl.
- You can't tell it's

32:09.333 --> 32:11.333
me?
Well, son, I'll call you a

32:11.333 --> 32:13.333
- little bit later, okay?
- All right, call me

32:13.333 --> 32:15.333
- when you're done.
- Bye, Lam.

32:15.333 --> 32:17.367
- Bye.
- He was so confused,

32:17.367 --> 32:19.367
- you guys.
- Look at that pretty

32:19.367 --> 32:21.367
girl-- oh, God!
Don't look at us.

32:21.367 --> 32:23.367
It's fine.
We can totally creep people out,

32:23.367 --> 32:25.367
- and no one will ever know.
- Hey, honey, hey!

32:25.367 --> 32:27.467
- We're on a Hollywood tour.
- Khloe!

32:27.467 --> 32:29.633
Oh, bye.

32:29.633 --> 32:31.633
Hollywood Tours?
Oh, my God, that's where

32:31.633 --> 32:33.633
- we're going?
- This is what we're

32:33.633 --> 32:35.667
- getting on.
- Oh, my God.

32:35.667 --> 32:37.667
I'm really embarrassed
and scared.

32:37.667 --> 32:39.900
I'm scared, too,
all of a sudden.

32:39.900 --> 32:42.567
I'm so nervous.

32:42.567 --> 32:45.200
I feel like we look so crazy and
I'm really scared the paparazzi

32:45.200 --> 32:47.567
- are gonna find us.
- Grandma, can we get

32:47.567 --> 32:49.900
- Subway?
- Yes.

32:49.900 --> 32:53.367
Can I get, uh, turkey, please?
Do you want it toasted or no?

32:53.367 --> 32:58.233
No, just plain.
And then, um, can we get mayo on

32:58.233 --> 33:00.633
- both?
- And pickles?

33:00.633 --> 33:06.833
Yeah.

33:06.833 --> 33:09.700
Oh, my God, there's
a paparazzi.

33:09.700 --> 33:11.867
- Yeah.
- Right straight

33:11.867 --> 33:13.867
- ahead-- I'm not... I'm done.
Mm-hmm, there is a

33:13.867 --> 33:16.333
paparazzi.
What do I do?

33:16.333 --> 33:18.700
We are not even at
the tour for two seconds, and

33:18.700 --> 33:20.700
all of a sudden, I notice
paparazzi.

33:20.700 --> 33:22.700
We're going home.
This is a fail.

33:22.700 --> 33:25.667
Honestly, I am so mad.
We sat in makeup for hours.

33:25.667 --> 33:30.267
- This is the worst-case scenario.
- Whoa!

33:30.267 --> 33:32.767
I can't even get my feet to go
in the right direction.

33:32.767 --> 33:37.400
Aah... Oh, sh... Oh!

33:42.100 --> 33:43.767
Oh, my God, there's
a paparazzi.

33:43.767 --> 33:45.100
- Yeah.
- Right straight

33:45.100 --> 33:46.867
- ahead-- I'm not... I'm done.
Mm-hmm, there is a

33:46.867 --> 33:49.667
paparazzi.
What do I do?

33:49.667 --> 33:52.533
He's right there on his phone.
I don't know how paparazzi

33:52.533 --> 33:55.200
even know we're at this
location.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.967
- Oh, my God.
- Khloe, just act in

33:57.967 --> 34:01.267
- character, act in character.
- Kendall, Kylie and I

34:01.267 --> 34:04.567
bolt for the tourist vehicle,
but the paparazzi doesn't

34:04.567 --> 34:06.367
realize it's Kendall, Kylie and
I.

34:06.367 --> 34:08.467
All right,
everybody, welcome aboard!

34:08.467 --> 34:12.267
You guys...
I'm going, I'm going home.

34:12.267 --> 34:15.233
I'm going home.
This is the most embarrassing

34:15.233 --> 34:17.533
thing I've ever...
Oh, my God.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.800
This was your
idea...

34:19.800 --> 34:22.333
- You guys, come on.
- This is so.

34:22.333 --> 34:24.933
- This is so embarrassing.
- I don't know why

34:24.933 --> 34:27.000
Kendall is freaking out.
There's one guy.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.667
I've spent, like, six hours in
prosthetic makeup.

34:30.667 --> 34:32.933
- I'm still going on this tour.
- Welcome to

34:32.933 --> 34:34.933
Hollywood, everybody.
My name is Doug, I'm gonna be

34:34.933 --> 34:37.167
your tour guide today.
We're gonna do a little

34:37.167 --> 34:39.167
Hollywood tour.
Well, I always feel it's

34:39.167 --> 34:41.167
good to start a glamorous
Hollywood tour right next

34:41.167 --> 34:42.667
to a 7-Eleven.
It's good stuff, right?

34:42.667 --> 34:44.767
I think I'm gonna
Snapchat before the paparazzi

34:44.767 --> 34:47.000
- sells the photos.
- Yeah, do it, do it,

34:47.000 --> 34:49.667
do it.
They can't get the first look.

34:49.667 --> 34:52.700
- Do it, do it, do it.
- We are just gonna post

34:52.700 --> 34:56.033
on social media so that we get
the story out there first and

34:56.033 --> 34:59.600
they can't twist it into their
own words.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.300
Little bit of selfie
love back there going on.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.767
- Good selfie time.
- Me and my

35:03.767 --> 35:06.367
- granddaughters.
- It's the old Kylie.

35:06.367 --> 35:08.700
Right away, we're gonna

35:08.700 --> 35:10.933
check out a pretty amazing
studio here.

35:10.933 --> 35:13.467
Does that seem like a big old
Hollywood movie studio?

35:13.467 --> 35:15.067
- No.
- No.

35:15.067 --> 35:16.433
That's actually a casting
office.

35:16.433 --> 35:18.833
That's where you go with your
headshot, trying to get work,

35:18.833 --> 35:21.533
- trying to beat out 300 people.
- Oh! Sam!

35:21.533 --> 35:25.200
That's what you could do!
As uncomfortable as we all are--

35:25.200 --> 35:28.733
and trust me, Dolores is not
happy-- I just know I have to,

35:28.733 --> 35:31.367
like, put it up in high gear and
I have to make the best of it

35:31.367 --> 35:33.367
and I have to make them have
fun.

35:33.367 --> 35:34.800
- Hi!
- The Walk of Fame down

35:34.800 --> 35:36.233
- there...
- We've never been to

35:36.233 --> 35:37.700
- California before.
- You've never been to

35:37.700 --> 35:39.433
- California before?
- No, sir.

35:39.433 --> 35:41.767
Oh, good, did you drive
out here or fly?

35:41.767 --> 35:43.333
Oh, I can't go on a
plane.

35:43.333 --> 35:45.133
I got metal pins all in my
legs...

35:45.133 --> 35:46.300
Oh, you have metal
pins?

35:46.300 --> 35:47.833
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

35:47.833 --> 35:49.700
- And a bad hip.
- You gonna get a hip

35:49.700 --> 35:51.267
- replacement, right?
- I've already got one,

35:51.267 --> 35:52.600
- sir.
- You had several.

35:52.600 --> 35:55.267
- Several.
- Skybar.

35:55.267 --> 35:58.400
That is where Cindy Crawford met
her husband Rande Gerber.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.300
You remember Cindy Crawford, the
beautiful supermodel?

36:00.300 --> 36:02.267
- She's still beautiful.
- I know.

36:02.267 --> 36:05.067
Her husband, Rande Gerber,
created the Skybar and it also

36:05.067 --> 36:08.067
- netted him his bride.
- He nutted in his

36:08.067 --> 36:11.367
bride?
That's very inappropriate, sir.

36:11.367 --> 36:13.900
I'm glad it's Kylie
and Khloe doing this with me,

36:13.900 --> 36:16.067
'cause I feel like any other
sister wouldn't have, like,

36:16.067 --> 36:18.533
- taken it like Khloe would.
- How about Chin Chin,

36:18.533 --> 36:21.000
one of my favorite spots.
Apparently, Kim Kardashian's

36:21.000 --> 36:24.067
favorite place over there.
She loves to get the Chinese

36:24.067 --> 36:25.600
- chicken.
- Kardashians?

36:25.600 --> 36:27.467
The Kartrashians?
I don't want to talk about those

36:27.467 --> 36:29.533
- Kartrashians.
- Did you guys hear about

36:29.533 --> 36:32.533
this, when Tyga wouldn't let
Paul McCartney into the club?

36:32.533 --> 36:34.300
Remember, the party?
Right here.

36:34.300 --> 36:36.600
- That's not true!
- That's not true.

36:36.600 --> 36:38.567
- You're wrong!
- I know it's true,

36:38.567 --> 36:39.967
'cause I read it on the
Internet.

36:39.967 --> 36:42.567
- So I know it has to be true.
- That's not true.

36:42.567 --> 36:44.567
It's so true.

36:44.567 --> 36:46.100
Kendall!

36:46.100 --> 36:47.867
Appears to have gone
south.

36:47.867 --> 36:52.467
- What should we do?
- Hi!

36:52.467 --> 36:54.233
Are you guys YouTube

36:54.233 --> 36:56.333
- stars?
- She's impregnated by

36:56.333 --> 36:58.267
a really popular YouTube
sensation.

36:58.267 --> 37:00.133
You were impregnated by
a pop-- oh.

37:00.133 --> 37:03.000
Even though it didn't
go how we expected, we're still

37:03.000 --> 37:05.567
- having so much fun.
- Ma'am from

37:05.567 --> 37:07.100
Albuquerque, have you ever seen
pictures of the Beverly Hills

37:07.100 --> 37:09.033
- Hotel?
- Seen pictures.

37:09.033 --> 37:11.167
- For sure, but...
- More and more

37:11.167 --> 37:13.967
paparazzi and fans are getting a
little crazy.

37:13.967 --> 37:16.500
You want to jump?
Can we jump out?

37:16.500 --> 37:21.100
So we decide to jump
off the bus and sprint to the

37:21.100 --> 37:24.333
Beverly Hills Hotel, because the
paparazzi aren't allowed there.

37:24.333 --> 37:29.100
Bye, guys.

37:29.100 --> 37:30.767
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

37:30.767 --> 37:32.433
Thank you.
All right, take care, ma'ams

37:32.433 --> 37:35.033
from Albuquerque.

37:49.333 --> 37:52.367
Wait...

37:52.367 --> 37:55.800
Should I take off my wig?

38:02.933 --> 38:05.133
You know that tobacco
commercial?

38:05.133 --> 38:08.367
"Smoking kills.
How much are your cigarettes

38:08.367 --> 38:10.833
worth, people?"
Khloe ripping her face

38:10.833 --> 38:15.033
off is the funniest thing I've
ever seen.

38:15.033 --> 38:17.667
- For sure.
- Oh, my God!

38:17.667 --> 38:21.667
That's real hair! Aah!

38:21.667 --> 38:24.033
That's the lady I want to be.
That was the old lady I wanted

38:24.033 --> 38:27.900
to be with her hair.

38:27.900 --> 38:29.833
Hey! Wait!
I love you, lady.

38:29.833 --> 38:32.733
I love you, too, though.
Okay!

38:32.733 --> 38:35.167
Wigs for everyone.
Wigs!

38:35.167 --> 38:39.367
Oh, my God, the paparazzi!

38:39.367 --> 38:42.133
What dicks are you all?
They got me like that and you

38:42.133 --> 38:45.200
got to look like normal old
Kylie?

38:45.200 --> 38:48.167
This is what happens when you
live a life of purity and

38:48.167 --> 38:52.433
non-alcoholic beverages.
Would you guys rather have done

38:52.433 --> 38:54.033
this with Kourtney, Kim or
Khloe?

38:54.033 --> 38:55.467
You!
Oh, my God, I've never

38:55.467 --> 38:57.967
Snapchatted so much in my life.
Oh, dude.

38:57.967 --> 39:01.133
You guys... learn from
my mistakes, people!

39:01.133 --> 39:03.867
I am so happy Khloe

39:03.867 --> 39:07.933
did this with us.
She made this such a fun

39:07.933 --> 39:09.700
- experience.
- This side is still

39:09.700 --> 39:11.400
- fat, though, but this is...
- We're really about

39:11.400 --> 39:13.200
- to get out like this?
- No.

39:13.200 --> 39:14.800
Whatever, fine.
Go. Go, go. They're done.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.167
Khloe, run.

39:22.767 --> 39:26.033
Hey, guys.

39:26.033 --> 39:29.133
Is this a good angle?

39:29.133 --> 39:32.333
- Ah, ah, ah!
- Well?

39:32.333 --> 39:34.433
We had the best
worst day of our lives.

39:34.433 --> 39:37.300
We had the best worst
day ever.

39:37.300 --> 39:40.000
You have to watch
this, it'll make you cry.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.333
You look like a troll.
She just looks like a slob.

39:43.333 --> 39:47.500
Hey, guys.

39:47.500 --> 39:54.267
Is this a good angle?

39:54.267 --> 39:57.100
You know, I feel like
this kind of shows me how much

39:57.100 --> 40:00.000
I've missed out on and, you
know, I think I need to start

40:00.000 --> 40:02.867
thinking more positively and,
going forward, I'm definitely

40:02.867 --> 40:06.600
going to put much more effort
into being a part of... of these

40:06.600 --> 40:08.667
- great times.
- We were like, "Dude,

40:08.667 --> 40:10.033
pull over to the Beverly Hills
Hotel."

40:10.033 --> 40:11.667
So he pulls over and we're like,
"All right, we're getting out!"

40:11.667 --> 40:15.233
And I hop over-- the paps get a
photo of me jumping out of the

40:15.233 --> 40:17.500
car, out of a tourist car.
It was so embarrassing.

40:17.500 --> 40:20.133
Was that not the
funniest day of life?

40:20.133 --> 40:23.600
Did that experience,
like, make you feel, like, any

40:23.600 --> 40:26.100
- kind of way?
- Subway was

40:26.100 --> 40:28.667
interesting.
Because no one took one picture

40:28.667 --> 40:30.500
of us in Subway.
There were all these kids and I

40:30.500 --> 40:32.600
saw everyone taking Inst...
photos of themselves, selfies.

40:32.600 --> 40:34.200
- Yeah.
- And no one paid

40:34.200 --> 40:35.967
attention to us and I was like,
that's so cool.

40:35.967 --> 40:37.933
To, like, go into a restaurant
and no one bothers you?

40:37.933 --> 40:39.533
- Yeah.
- And even, like, the

40:39.533 --> 40:40.900
guy was like, "What would you
like?"

40:40.900 --> 40:42.400
- And we were like...
- Just life.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.900
I mean, I think you just
gotta, like, surrender to the

40:44.900 --> 40:48.167
fact that paparazzi is not going
anywhere.

40:48.167 --> 40:51.167
We're all so
blessed, but I do feel like Kim

40:51.167 --> 40:53.667
is somewhat right, and if
paparazzi really are gonna be

40:53.667 --> 40:56.900
this much a part of our lives,
then laughing about it makes it

40:56.900 --> 40:59.000
- a little bit easier.
- They were standing

40:59.000 --> 41:00.700
next to the bus and didn't take
photos of us.

41:00.700 --> 41:02.433
And we were sitting like...
Okay.

41:02.433 --> 41:04.467
And then Kendall walked out of
the Subway or whatever and they

41:04.467 --> 41:07.200
all ran up to...
And we were dying, like,

41:07.200 --> 41:08.733
This trip was so

41:08.733 --> 41:10.467
ridiculous,
and we will be laughing

41:10.467 --> 41:13.367
about it for a really long time.
Um, can someone take my face

41:13.367 --> 41:16.533
off?

41:26.433 --> 41:28.867
- Hi, P!
- Hi.

41:28.867 --> 41:31.433
- You look so cute.
- So everybody be

41:31.433 --> 41:33.800
- prepared to fall.
- I have a bad knee,

41:33.800 --> 41:35.567
- though.
- You got a bad

41:35.567 --> 41:39.133
- everything.
- Is Lovey going with

41:39.133 --> 41:41.100
- us?
- Yeah, Lovey's coming,

41:41.100 --> 41:43.267
- too.
- I think the last time I

41:43.267 --> 41:46.033
roller-skated, I was ten years
old.

41:46.033 --> 41:50.467
So I'm really not in the mood
for an injury and I'm nervous.

41:50.467 --> 41:52.900
Okay, you ready to
rock and roll?

41:56.900 --> 41:59.267
- You're doing so good.
- I can't even get my

41:59.267 --> 42:01.833
feet to go in the right
direction.

42:01.833 --> 42:05.933
Ah!
You scared me!

42:05.933 --> 42:09.733
Oh, sh...

42:09.733 --> 42:13.400
Whoa...
I broke your fall.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.567
- Oh!
- See, Corey's suggestions

42:15.567 --> 42:18.300
are fun, aren't they?
You're not gonna take me down

42:18.300 --> 42:21.467
- with you.
- I knew I was gonna

42:21.467 --> 42:23.233
fall.
I knew it.

42:23.233 --> 42:26.567
But I'm not hurt and as long as
Corey's having fun, there's

42:26.567 --> 42:28.933
nothing in the world that
matters more to me.

42:28.933 --> 42:31.367
You are especially
looking good on skates.

42:31.367 --> 42:34.467
I definitely don't like

42:34.467 --> 42:36.367
to be outside of my comfort
zone.

42:36.367 --> 42:39.333
But you know what?
I must say that it's been really

42:39.333 --> 42:43.300
great being here with Corey and
just spending some time doing

42:43.300 --> 42:46.200
something that makes Corey
really happy.

42:46.200 --> 42:47.567
It was a good date that you
organized.

42:47.567 --> 42:49.233
- Well, I...
- A really good date.

42:49.233 --> 42:50.900
I appreciate you
trying something a little

42:50.900 --> 42:52.600
different and out of your
comfort zone.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.367
But this is cool.

42:54.367 --> 42:55.967
This is what I like to do.
This is what I used to do two

42:55.967 --> 42:57.600
days a week.
Put my right hand in my pocket.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.467
- Oh, my God.
- I had my ten dollars

42:59.467 --> 43:02.167
for my hot dogs and my drinks.
And then the other little young

43:02.167 --> 43:04.300
lady that needs something to
drink, she was a little parched.

43:04.300 --> 43:06.033
Uh-huh.
So you're like a ten-dollar date

43:06.033 --> 43:07.800
- guy.
- No, I would loan a

43:07.800 --> 43:10.533
girl 50 cent if they needed 50
cent or a dollar.

43:10.533 --> 43:13.033
Mmm.
Will you loan me a dollar?

43:13.033 --> 43:15.067
I would loan you my
life.

43:15.067 --> 43:19.267
I will loan you my life.
Keeping Up with

43:19.267 --> 43:21.333
- the Kardashians...
- I was thinking of

43:21.333 --> 43:22.967
getting one of those people
that look like Kim.

43:22.967 --> 43:24.500
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

43:24.500 --> 43:26.000
Well, this is
Camilla.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.033
- What is going on?
- This is awkward.

43:28.033 --> 43:29.667
You know how everybody
says there's, like, that

43:29.667 --> 43:31.767
Kardashian curse?
For the men?

43:31.767 --> 43:33.467
- Yes.
- You do have a

43:33.467 --> 43:35.467
curse.
Your reading is talking about

43:35.467 --> 43:38.067
- working with a rooster.
- We're gonna, like,

43:38.067 --> 43:41.267
- proceed with our divorce.
- I think Lamar needs us

43:41.267 --> 43:43.633
- as a family.
- But Lamar and I are

43:43.633 --> 43:45.367
not together.
