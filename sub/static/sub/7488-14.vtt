WEBVTT

00:06.617 --> 00:09.620
Rise and shine, sleepy heads!

00:09.621 --> 00:11.622
We have a big day ahead.

00:11.623 --> 00:16.303
The MyTAB 6 goes on
sale in only 13 hours.

00:16.699 --> 00:18.367
How do you like your eggs?

00:18.368 --> 00:20.414
Four hours from now.

00:20.415 --> 00:22.705
And scrambled.

00:22.706 --> 00:26.130
Why did you have to wake
us up at 6:00 A.M.?

00:26.131 --> 00:28.377
Everybody else is
still sleeping...

00:28.378 --> 00:31.738
Even the mall statue guy.

00:32.484 --> 00:35.852
I woke you up so we can
enjoy this together!

00:35.853 --> 00:40.413
We're doing this as a team.
Right, Trish?

00:41.178 --> 00:43.158
Trish?

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:53.400 --> 00:55.671
Oh, hey guys.

00:55.672 --> 00:57.774
I totally slept here.

00:57.775 --> 01:00.924
In fact, I'm sleeping now.

01:00.925 --> 01:03.685
I'm sleepwalking.

01:03.798 --> 01:06.451
You're also sleep-lying.

01:06.452 --> 01:08.654
Fine, I didn't sleep here.

01:08.655 --> 01:11.140
Why do we have to wait
in this ridiculous

01:11.141 --> 01:13.793
line if we're just getting
one MyTAB anyway?

01:13.794 --> 01:16.529
First of all, because it's fun.

01:16.530 --> 01:18.390
Woo!

01:19.467 --> 01:22.624
Skip to "second of all."

01:22.625 --> 01:25.996
Second of all, MyTAB's are
the hottest thing out there.

01:25.997 --> 01:27.909
If we don't get ours
today, it'll be months

01:27.921 --> 01:29.845
before Tech Town gets
another shipment in.

01:29.846 --> 01:33.516
I can't wait months. I really
need that new video editing app.

01:33.517 --> 01:35.585
I really need the new
music recording app.

01:35.586 --> 01:39.926
And I really need to re-sell our MyTAB
for five times what we pay for it.

01:39.927 --> 01:42.153
We're not re-selling it.

01:42.154 --> 01:44.796
I hear there's an awesome
cloud identifying app.

01:44.797 --> 01:48.114
I'm gonna be the coolest girl
in my cloud watching club!

01:48.115 --> 01:53.101
If you really wanna be cool, never
mention cloud watching club again.

01:53.102 --> 01:56.499
If all we're gonna do is wait in this
line, can't we go back to sleep?

01:56.500 --> 01:59.941
No, because in exactly
five seconds,

01:59.942 --> 02:03.782
it's officially Owen's birthday!

02:04.352 --> 02:06.714
Happy Birthday, Owen!

02:06.715 --> 02:10.375
Or should I say "bird-thday"?

02:12.155 --> 02:14.156
You should say "birthday."

02:14.157 --> 02:16.814
I can't believe you brought
Owen to wait in line with us.

02:16.815 --> 02:20.545
He can keep us company
and tell us stories.

02:25.172 --> 02:28.147
Don't you, Owen? Come
on, like we practiced.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.350
"Ally's cool, Ally's cool."

02:31.351 --> 02:36.511
Maybe he can talk but he
just can't tell a lie.

02:38.456 --> 02:41.558
<i>When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

02:41.559 --> 02:44.693
<i>'Cause you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

02:44.694 --> 02:46.225
<i>You're my point,
you're my guard.</i>

02:46.226 --> 02:47.844
<i>You're the perfect chord.</i>

02:47.845 --> 02:50.889
<i>And I see our names together
on every billboard.</i>

02:50.890 --> 02:53.948
<i>We're headed for the top,
we've got it on lock.</i>

02:53.949 --> 02:55.562
<i>We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

02:55.563 --> 02:57.885
<i>And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

02:57.886 --> 03:02.023
<i>Oh, there's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:02.024 --> 03:05.059
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:05.060 --> 03:08.129
<i>It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

03:08.130 --> 03:11.452
<i>With you it's like, "whoa,".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

03:11.453 --> 03:14.102
<i>I own this dream.</i>

03:14.103 --> 03:17.480
<i>'Cause I got you with me.</i>

03:17.481 --> 03:20.598
<i>There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:20.599 --> 03:24.919
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:30.202 --> 03:32.654
And that's your last
birthday present, Owen.

03:32.655 --> 03:35.124
Sorry I didn't get
you a lot this year.

03:35.125 --> 03:36.759
Didn't get him a lot?!

03:36.760 --> 03:42.580
We've been watching you open
bird presents for three hours.

03:43.967 --> 03:46.624
Uh-oh, Dez, here comes Mindy.

03:46.625 --> 03:48.775
Oh no! She has a crush on me.

03:48.776 --> 03:50.610
- Hide me!
- I'll hide you.

03:50.611 --> 03:53.011
Okay... Ooh!

03:55.927 --> 03:58.687
Hey, Dezzy-cakes.

03:59.036 --> 04:00.970
Did you get my flowers?

04:00.971 --> 04:02.575
You sent me flowers?

04:02.576 --> 04:05.607
No! Did you get me...

04:05.608 --> 04:07.948
My flowers?

04:17.387 --> 04:19.224
Aw...

04:19.225 --> 04:21.505
Thank you.

04:24.682 --> 04:27.451
Uh, Mindy, you
can't cut in line.

04:27.452 --> 04:29.003
No cutsies.

04:29.004 --> 04:31.227
But she was just
saving my space.

04:31.228 --> 04:34.358
Also no savesies. Sorry.

04:34.359 --> 04:37.212
- Oh.
- Back of the line.

04:37.213 --> 04:40.379
Okay, I don't know why
you're so mean to me,

04:40.380 --> 04:44.188
because I am always
so nice to you.

04:44.189 --> 04:48.329
Would you shut your
stupid bird up?!

04:48.530 --> 04:52.383
I'll have you know my bird is not stupid.
He talks a lot.

04:52.384 --> 04:56.764
Well, I wonder where
he gets that from.

05:02.632 --> 05:05.225
Arr, ye bird is so loud!

05:05.226 --> 05:08.456
Me bird's been here all night,
she hasn't made a peep.

05:08.457 --> 05:12.537
Pirate Frank, your
bird's not real.

05:13.608 --> 05:17.401
Aw, my Dad just texted. He wants
me to watch the store today.

05:17.402 --> 05:20.583
Don't worry. We can keep waiting
in line and you can meet us later.

05:20.584 --> 05:24.010
I'm going with Ally. I'm tired
from hanging out here all night.

05:24.011 --> 05:25.940
You weren't here all night.

05:25.941 --> 05:29.444
Okay, I'm just tired of
hanging out with you.

05:29.445 --> 05:32.420
I don't know about leaving
you guys in line alone.

05:32.421 --> 05:35.298
Can I trust you to
hold our place?

05:35.299 --> 05:37.260
Can she trust us?!

05:37.261 --> 05:39.688
Ally, please. It's not that
hard to stand in line.

05:39.689 --> 05:42.050
Yeah, the key is
to stay focused.

05:42.051 --> 05:45.291
Hey, is that a balloon?

05:45.309 --> 05:48.129
You can trust us.

05:51.499 --> 05:53.603
Attention everyone!

05:53.604 --> 05:57.574
I am leaving the line, but my
friends are holding my space.

05:57.575 --> 06:00.644
However, since we are
only buying one MyTAB,

06:00.645 --> 06:04.414
this is not a violation
of the no-savesies rule.

06:04.415 --> 06:09.275
- In addition...
- No one cares. Leave already!

06:19.497 --> 06:21.364
What's with the popcorn machine?

06:21.365 --> 06:25.635
My Dad found it in the dumpster
behind the movie theater.

06:25.636 --> 06:28.814
He's giving it to Owen
for his birthday.

06:28.815 --> 06:31.695
Owen loves popcorn.

06:33.431 --> 06:36.671
Did Owen tell you that?

06:37.782 --> 06:41.197
I wish I didn't have to work today.
I need to be in that line.

06:41.198 --> 06:44.309
Relax. It's not like Dez
is there by himself.

06:44.310 --> 06:47.480
Austin is with him, and Austin
would never leave the line.

06:47.481 --> 06:49.627
Hey, guys!

06:49.628 --> 06:52.388
I left the line.

06:52.472 --> 06:54.073
Why?

06:54.074 --> 06:55.916
I needed a break.

06:55.917 --> 06:59.286
You left Dez there by himself?

06:59.287 --> 07:01.518
Ally, it's only
been five minutes.

07:01.519 --> 07:03.947
You think Dez is just gonna let
people go in front of him?

07:03.948 --> 07:07.059
You can cut in front of me.
I insist, I insist.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.860
Go.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.228
Hey Bill.

07:10.229 --> 07:14.087
Oh actually, it's Billl
with three "L" s.

07:14.088 --> 07:16.687
Right, sorry, Billl.

07:16.688 --> 07:19.100
It's "alll" good.

07:19.101 --> 07:21.359
Why'd you let those people
cut in front of you?

07:21.360 --> 07:24.803
They had a really sad story
about why they needed a MyTAB.

07:24.804 --> 07:29.635
Dude, they so took advantage
of your kindness.

07:29.636 --> 07:32.772
On a totally unrelated note...

07:32.773 --> 07:36.866
If I don't get a MyTAB, my
girlfriend's gonna break up with me.

07:36.867 --> 07:40.642
- That's terrible.
- Yeah. If she breaks up with me,

07:40.643 --> 07:48.643
I'lll be all... ll... ll...
ll... ll... ll...

07:49.105 --> 07:52.345
- All what?!
- All sad.

07:52.660 --> 07:56.006
I don't want you to
lose your girlfriend.

07:56.007 --> 07:57.597
You can cut in front of me.

07:57.598 --> 08:00.358
Oh thanks, buddy!

08:04.739 --> 08:06.140
Hey, Ally.

08:06.141 --> 08:08.509
Dez, what happened?

08:08.510 --> 08:10.994
You're like 20 spaces
behind where we were.

08:10.995 --> 08:13.878
I knew I couldn't trust you.

08:13.879 --> 08:15.972
I had to let those people
cut in front of me.

08:15.973 --> 08:19.537
They all had such sad stories.

08:19.538 --> 08:22.913
Seriously? You let statue
guy cut in front of you?

08:22.914 --> 08:24.948
He doesn't even speak.

08:24.949 --> 08:29.329
- He gave me a really sad face.
- Huh.

08:35.738 --> 08:37.672
Ally didn't trust me
to stand in line,

08:37.673 --> 08:40.509
so she sent me back here to
help you watch the store.

08:40.510 --> 08:42.645
What are you doing?

08:42.645 --> 08:44.311
Ally asked me to feed Owen.

08:44.312 --> 08:46.618
She sent me like 20 pages
of bird feeding rules.

08:46.619 --> 08:50.819
She doesn't trust
us to do anything.

08:51.144 --> 08:53.581
That's probably her
texting me again.

08:53.582 --> 08:55.502
Here.

08:59.636 --> 09:02.096
Sorry, buddy.

09:04.292 --> 09:08.107
"P.S. When you feed Owen,
do not open the cage."

09:08.108 --> 09:09.968
Hmm.

09:15.346 --> 09:19.426
"And do not leave
the window open."

09:24.620 --> 09:27.740
Owen! Owen, come back!

09:30.065 --> 09:33.001
Ally's gonna freak. We have to
find him before she finds out.

09:33.002 --> 09:35.172
I know some bird calls.

09:35.173 --> 09:38.233
This is my Cockatiel.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.088
I think that was a chicken call.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.678
No, I ordered from the
chicken hut earlier.

09:51.679 --> 09:54.319
<i>I was starving.</i>

09:54.487 --> 09:58.447
Thank you, or
should I say brawk!

10:09.162 --> 10:11.202
Austin!

10:11.530 --> 10:13.708
You left Dez alone in the store?

10:13.709 --> 10:16.311
No, he's not alone.

10:16.312 --> 10:18.107
Because Owen's there!

10:18.108 --> 10:22.248
In his closed cage
where he belongs.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.289
- Oh, is that Ally's...
- Nose?

10:28.290 --> 10:32.070
Yep, that's Ally's nose. Boop!

10:32.527 --> 10:35.527
Don't boop my nose.

10:36.011 --> 10:40.031
Well, I'm gonna
run off that way.

10:40.702 --> 10:42.729
He was acting weird.

10:42.730 --> 10:45.774
Yeah! The way he
ran off that way?

10:45.775 --> 10:47.892
That was weird.

10:47.893 --> 10:51.913
Well, I'm gonna
run off that way.

10:54.294 --> 10:57.956
Pretty bird! Owen's
a pretty bird.

10:57.957 --> 11:00.431
- You found Owen?!
- Nope.

11:00.432 --> 11:02.648
But I built a new Owen.

11:02.649 --> 11:04.932
Ally will never know
the difference.

11:04.933 --> 11:07.324
Yeah, this looks
exactly like him.

11:07.325 --> 11:10.207
Except for the candy corn beak.

11:10.208 --> 11:13.508
Let's see how he flies.

11:14.455 --> 11:17.791
He can't fly... He's fake.

11:17.792 --> 11:20.012
How could you guys let
the bird get away?

11:20.013 --> 11:22.257
If Ally finds out,
it'll destroy her.

11:22.258 --> 11:27.538
We have to get Ally's bird back.
Let's all think.

11:28.264 --> 11:31.467
Okay, Ally says Owen
loves popcorn, right?

11:31.468 --> 11:34.370
Let's set up a trail of popcorn
to lure Owen back to his cage.

11:34.371 --> 11:36.271
- Yes!
- There you go. Let's do it.

11:36.272 --> 11:38.192
Okay.

11:39.788 --> 11:41.888
I know.

11:45.876 --> 11:48.664
Aren't you putting in
a little too much?

11:48.665 --> 11:53.919
I'm sorry, who here was
fired from a popcorn store?

11:53.920 --> 11:57.100
That's what I thought.

11:57.393 --> 12:01.533
In the meantime,
let's keep looking.

12:49.679 --> 12:51.930
Where do ye think ye be going?

12:51.931 --> 12:54.931
Uh, that's my spot.

12:55.635 --> 12:57.253
You got out of line.

12:57.254 --> 12:59.516
She got out of line!

12:59.517 --> 13:00.962
But I just...

13:00.963 --> 13:05.351
No savesies, no cutsies,
no insies, no outsies.

13:05.352 --> 13:08.472
Your rules, bird girl.

13:08.826 --> 13:10.818
I wasn't really outsie.

13:10.819 --> 13:12.710
I was just throwing
my apple away.

13:12.711 --> 13:15.554
Littering rules take
precedence over line rules.

13:15.555 --> 13:21.315
Oh. Not according to this 20-page
document you handed out.

13:21.696 --> 13:24.697
Why am I so thorough?

13:24.698 --> 13:26.800
Back of the line, All-ly.

13:26.801 --> 13:30.191
Back of the line!
Back of the line!

13:30.192 --> 13:33.216
Back of the line!
Back of the line!

13:33.217 --> 13:38.197
- Really?
- Back of the line! Back of the line!

13:41.293 --> 13:43.633
Owen! Owen!

13:46.598 --> 13:50.378
Get your "Owen" popcorn, Austin.

13:50.735 --> 13:53.975
This popcorn's "my-en."

13:56.111 --> 13:58.890
Ally, what are you doing here?

13:58.891 --> 14:00.677
I got booted to the
back of the line.

14:00.678 --> 14:03.547
Now there's too many people.
We'll never get a MyTAB.

14:03.548 --> 14:06.550
- I really messed up.
- People mess up.

14:06.551 --> 14:09.443
- That's okay.
- It... It's not.

14:09.444 --> 14:12.032
I gave you guys a hard time
about being irresponsible,

14:12.033 --> 14:15.325
and now we're not getting
a MyTAB because of me.

14:15.326 --> 14:18.629
Ally, you made a mistake.

14:18.630 --> 14:23.182
What are friends for, if not for
understanding each others' mistakes?

14:23.183 --> 14:26.106
And immediately forgiving them?

14:26.107 --> 14:28.650
We know you'd do the same
if we ever made a mistake,

14:28.651 --> 14:32.836
and you'd be just as
understanding, if not...

14:32.837 --> 14:34.757
More.

14:35.647 --> 14:38.827
Okay, what's going on?

14:39.207 --> 14:41.172
Nothing.

14:41.173 --> 14:44.621
Why are you both talking
at the same time?

14:44.622 --> 14:46.962
We're not.

14:47.323 --> 14:50.594
Why'd you both look upstairs?

14:50.595 --> 14:52.935
We didn't!

15:06.479 --> 15:08.759
Hey, Ally.

15:09.714 --> 15:11.829
What happened in here?

15:11.830 --> 15:14.235
That popcorn machine your Dad
found in the dumpster is broken.

15:14.236 --> 15:18.796
It won't turn off.
I've tried everything.

15:21.005 --> 15:22.557
Okay, maybe not everything.

15:22.558 --> 15:27.529
So this is what you guys
were trying to hide from me?

15:27.530 --> 15:28.912
Actually no.

15:28.913 --> 15:33.467
There's something way worse
we need to talk to you about.

15:33.468 --> 15:36.438
Uh, what's worse than this?

15:36.439 --> 15:39.442
Uh, nothing. It
could've been worse.

15:39.443 --> 15:42.404
Birds could've flown away!

15:42.405 --> 15:45.525
Why would I say that?

15:45.650 --> 15:48.191
You know what? We're
gonna get our MyTAB.

15:48.192 --> 15:51.421
I didn't sleep on the mall floor all
night just to give up this easy.

15:51.422 --> 15:56.342
You didn't sleep on the
mall floor all night.

15:57.005 --> 16:00.344
How are we gonna get our MyTAB if we
have to start at the back of the line?

16:00.345 --> 16:02.597
Since we can't move
up in the line,

16:02.598 --> 16:07.214
we're gonna have to figure out ways
to get people to move out of line.

16:07.215 --> 16:12.473
We're also gonna have to figure out
ways to get rid of all this popcorn.

16:12.474 --> 16:17.645
There's only one way to get
rid of all this popcorn.

16:17.646 --> 16:21.385
Dez, that's gonna
take way too long.

16:21.386 --> 16:23.972
Let me help you.

16:23.973 --> 16:25.553
Whoa!

16:25.554 --> 16:29.934
- This is the best day ever!
- I know!

16:34.730 --> 16:36.164
I hope this works.

16:36.165 --> 16:41.956
If there's one thing people like more
than a MyTAB, it's a free MyTAB.

16:41.957 --> 16:46.229
Hey, everybody, I just got
a job at Tech Town and...

16:46.230 --> 16:49.752
Good news... We're giving
away a free MyTAB!

16:49.753 --> 16:54.581
All you gotta do is find a golden
horseshoe hidden somewhere in this mall.

16:54.582 --> 16:58.542
Oh, you heard me...
A free MyTAB.

16:59.102 --> 17:02.121
They're totally gonna fall for it.
Then we'll steal their spots in line.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.222
Suckers!

17:07.698 --> 17:09.617
Oops.

17:10.598 --> 17:13.300
Did you guys hear about
that weather report?

17:13.300 --> 17:16.470
A freak storm is
about to hit Miami.

17:16.471 --> 17:18.571
Everyone should evacuate.

17:18.573 --> 17:21.674
They say there's going to
be golf-ball size hail.

17:21.675 --> 17:25.454
- Evacuate!
- Evacuate, evacuate!

17:26.579 --> 17:27.939
Evacuate!

17:27.940 --> 17:33.840
I couldn't find hail the size of golf
balls, so I just got cheese balls.

17:37.326 --> 17:41.269
We were so starving, we were about to
give up our spaces to get some food.

17:41.270 --> 17:46.850
Now we don't have to, because
it's raining sky cheese!

17:48.638 --> 17:51.291
The MyTAB's are going on
sale in five minutes.

17:51.292 --> 17:54.216
What are we gonna do?

17:54.217 --> 17:57.039
Austin, grab your guitar.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.997
I know one thing people want
even more than a MyTAB.

17:59.998 --> 18:02.114
Bacon ice cream.

18:02.115 --> 18:05.237
No, people wanna see
Austin in concert.

18:05.238 --> 18:07.355
Oh, that's a great idea, Ally.

18:07.356 --> 18:12.799
Yeah. Hey, everybody! I'm playing my
first ever acoustic show, and it's free!

18:12.800 --> 18:14.355
Follow me.

18:14.356 --> 18:17.776
Out of the way move move!

18:18.782 --> 18:21.344
It worked! Let's
go get that MyTAB.

18:21.345 --> 18:23.084
Okay, you go get that MyTAB,

18:23.085 --> 18:26.050
I'm gonna go see Austin Moon's
first ever acoustic concert.

18:26.051 --> 18:27.911
Woo!

18:28.432 --> 18:34.332
Well, it looks like it's just you
and me getting the MyTAB, Trish.

18:34.433 --> 18:37.305
Looks like it's just me.

18:37.306 --> 18:39.226
Boop!

18:44.361 --> 18:49.041
This next song is called
"Not A Love Song."

18:50.174 --> 18:52.871
<i>You're always on my mind.</i>

18:52.872 --> 18:56.710
<i>I think about you
all the time...</i>

18:56.711 --> 18:58.811
<i>Um, no.</i>

18:59.539 --> 19:02.130
<i>Let's not talk about it.</i>

19:02.131 --> 19:04.466
<i>Drama, we can live without it.</i>

19:04.467 --> 19:07.418
<i>Catch wave if we're bored,
there's a clock we'll ignore.</i>

19:07.419 --> 19:10.237
<i>Find a way around it.</i>

19:10.238 --> 19:12.910
<i>Girl, I can tell it's something.</i>

19:12.911 --> 19:15.327
<i>Even when you say it's nothing.</i>

19:15.328 --> 19:18.064
<i>When you're playing with your
hair like you just don't care.</i>

19:18.065 --> 19:21.345
<i>It's a tell, you're bluffing...</i>

19:21.346 --> 19:23.547
<i>Please don't take
this the wrong way.</i>

19:23.548 --> 19:28.075
<i>I love the things you do, it's
how you do the things you love.</i>

19:28.076 --> 19:30.886
<i>But it's not a love song.</i>

19:30.887 --> 19:33.647
<i>Not a love song.</i>

19:34.010 --> 19:38.623
<i>I love the way you get me,
but correct me if I'm wrong.</i>

19:38.624 --> 19:41.488
<i>This is not a love song.</i>

19:41.489 --> 19:44.249
<i>Not a love song.</i>

19:44.525 --> 19:49.363
<i>I love the things you do, it's
how you do the things you love.</i>

19:49.364 --> 19:52.920
<i>The way you say it,
put me through it.</i>

19:52.921 --> 19:55.477
<i>I guess I always knew it.</i>

19:55.478 --> 20:00.176
<i>I love the way you get me,
but correct me if I'm wrong.</i>

20:00.177 --> 20:03.027
<i>This is not a love song.</i>

20:03.028 --> 20:05.788
<i>Not a love song.</i>

20:18.195 --> 20:19.474
Did you get it?

20:19.475 --> 20:21.148
No, they were all sold out.

20:21.149 --> 20:23.321
- Oh seriously?
- No way! Oh man!

20:23.322 --> 20:24.873
Kidding!

20:24.874 --> 20:28.051
Awesome! Whoa! It's even
cooler than I thought!

20:28.052 --> 20:31.482
Oh, it was so worth
waiting all night.

20:31.483 --> 20:34.166
You didn't wait all night.

20:34.167 --> 20:37.757
And the best part is
it's ours forever.

20:37.758 --> 20:39.216
It's mine now.

20:39.217 --> 20:42.817
I found the golden horseshoe!

20:44.523 --> 20:47.669
Dez, you actually hid
a golden horseshoe?

20:47.670 --> 20:51.229
Well, yeah-huh. A Tech
Town employee never lies.

20:51.230 --> 20:55.370
You don't really
work at Tech Town.

20:55.943 --> 20:57.782
Dez, do something.

20:57.783 --> 21:00.483
Okay okay. Uh...

21:01.644 --> 21:06.384
Hey, Mindy, how about I take you on a
date and you give us back the MyTAB?

21:06.385 --> 21:09.708
How about you take me on a
date and I keep the MyTAB?

21:09.709 --> 21:12.123
Awesome. Wait.

21:12.124 --> 21:13.918
Oh man!

21:13.919 --> 21:15.886
See you Friday
night, Dezzy-cakes.

21:15.887 --> 21:19.324
- Ooh, I actually have plans...
- I said Friday night!

21:19.325 --> 21:22.445
Pick you up at 8:00.

21:31.276 --> 21:33.970
So Owen, did you have
a nice birthday?

21:33.971 --> 21:36.829
Give it up, Ally. The
bird's never gonna talk.

21:36.830 --> 21:40.246
Austin let me of the cage.
Trish and Dez knew about it.

21:40.247 --> 21:41.877
Wait, there's more.

21:41.878 --> 21:44.406
Dez touched your song book.

21:44.407 --> 21:48.578
Don't listen to Owen he doesn't
know what he's talking about.

21:48.579 --> 21:51.524
I tried to find you earlier, but
I got lost in the food court.

21:51.525 --> 21:53.326
Then I pooped on a statue.

21:53.327 --> 21:55.682
It turned out to be a real guy.

21:55.683 --> 21:58.623
Wait, there's more.
