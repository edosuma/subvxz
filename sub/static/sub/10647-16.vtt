I don't know. I've seen
some pretty strange universes.

00:11.087 --> 00:13.527
The dude here about to get
schooled by my gaming skills...

00:13.573 --> 00:16.771
Miles Morales, a Spider-Man
from another universe.

00:16.902 --> 00:19.027
He helped save our world,
but in the process,

00:19.073 --> 00:21.548
shattered the gizmo that made
dimensional travel possible.

00:21.642 --> 00:23.001
The Siege Perilous.

00:23.197 --> 00:24.829
So Miles is kind of stranded here.

00:25.027 --> 00:26.732
I promised I'd get him back home.

00:27.344 --> 00:28.749
Well, I'm still working on that.

00:34.823 --> 00:36.837
Or buy a pig?

00:37.025 --> 00:39.163
You really think
I would buy a farm animal?

00:39.209 --> 00:42.723
I never know with you.
(SNORTING CONTINUES)

00:42.903 --> 00:45.427
Unless Aunt May's starting
a farm and didn't tell me.

00:54.779 --> 00:57.323
Why aren't you in your own weird

01:13.214 --> 01:15.836
It's called a light bulb?

01:16.040 --> 01:18.168

K'un-Lun stands at the

03:44.491 --> 03:48.500
That's why it's easier for them
to infiltrate our universe at this location.

Those things are from another universe?
- Yeah, remember Madame Web?

This is the Web of Realities,
Spider-Man,

04:09.321 --> 04:12.746
by which I can glimpse into
all possibilities and worlds.

04:12.871 --> 04:14.370
Madame Web has summoned you here

04:14.503 --> 04:17.278
because great and
catastrophic forces are afoot,

04:17.426 --> 04:18.915
due to your actions.

04:19.000 --> 04:19.958
What did we do?

04:20.091 --> 04:22.427
You shattered the Siege Perilous.

04:23.748 --> 04:26.372
Yeah, to save our world
from going kersplooie.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.343

I said, "kersplooie."

04:28.492 --> 04:30.270
Perhaps so.
But on impact,

04:30.381 --> 04:33.237
the shards of the Siege
scattered into
many dimensions.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.563
Now the fragments
themselves together,

04:35.758 --> 04:38.946
bringing along whatever alternate
dimension they happen to be in,

04:38.992 --> 04:41.623
smashing them into each other.
- And let me guess.

04:41.732 --> 04:43.930
Universes banging against
each other...Bad.

04:44.031 --> 04:46.451
Only if you don't want
to destroy all of reality.

04:46.546 --> 04:48.618
Now let's get you prepped.
- For what?

04:48.719 --> 04:51.220
To travel between
dimensions, Spider-Man.

04:51.337 --> 04:54.889
You are the two that shattered
the Siege Perilous across dimensions.

04:55.022 --> 04:58.393
Only the both of you can gather
the pieces and bind them back together.

04:58.580 --> 05:01.312
You want us to recover the shards
before they destroy everything.

05:01.421 --> 05:03.975
That one's quick on the uptake.
- Yeah, he...

05:04.226 --> 05:06.594
Wait. Is that a dig at me?

05:07.102 --> 05:10.006
We pulled this shard out of
the ruins of an Inhuman city.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.333
This one will act
as a compass,

05:11.434 --> 05:13.911
guiding you to the location
of the other shards.

05:14.121 --> 05:17.144
Keep it safe.
- I will use the power of K'un-Lun

05:17.293 --> 05:21.132
to join with the consciousness
of the infinite and open a portal.

05:23.591 --> 05:27.227
I, too, must use all my magics
to help power the web.

05:27.399 --> 05:29.633
You have one chance
at this, Spider-Man.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.496
Good luck.

05:35.570 --> 05:36.808
You okay with
all this, Miles?

05:36.956 --> 05:39.352

cleanse and restore them all!

- Go.

Kind of.

I won't let you destroy them.

07:26.782 --> 07:30.074
"Destroy them"?
I wish.

07:30.230 --> 07:33.015
I dust them every night.
They just re-spawn later.

I don't know who you are, but
they were my friends and team-mates.

the name Blood Spider,

to feed on me.

08:24.234 --> 08:25.804
I'm Spider-Man, too.

08:25.989 --> 08:28.623
We both are, but
from different universes.

08:28.693 --> 08:30.461

No. This way.

This is not your world.

Yeah, you're not gonna
believe this,

08:41.062 --> 08:42.842
but to make a long story short,

08:42.999 --> 08:45.180
we need to find another piece of this.

08:45.235 --> 08:48.237
It's called the
Siege Perilous, and it...

08:48.346 --> 08:50.041
Well, it's kind of science-y.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.590
Let me guess. That shard
has quantum properties,

08:52.691 --> 08:54.846
and it's searching for
the missing piece of itself.

08:55.755 --> 08:58.212
We have science
here, too. Lead on.

this Siege thing can do.

So, have vampires
always been a thing here?

They're not in your universe?
- Not like this.

We've had them for eons,

09:11.852 --> 09:13.554

09:13.663 --> 09:15.821
forced all the vampire
factions under his rule

09:15.892 --> 09:17.419
that they became
so powerful.

09:17.560 --> 09:18.946
So they took over
the city.

09:19.086 --> 09:21.259
Half the planet,
and spreading.

09:21.422 --> 09:24.796
If sunlight didn't stop them,
they'd be in complete control.

Did you say "Lizard"?
The Lizard in my world was tough,

09:30.572 --> 09:32.446
but now he's just a friendly scientist.

09:32.610 --> 09:36.107

act differently in this dimension.

10:59.909 --> 11:02.637
Cool! Ugh!
Also, ew!

11:02.848 --> 11:06.168
What did I stick my hand into?
Feels gross and...

11:06.214 --> 11:07.866
(SNIFFS) Oh!
I don't wanna know.

11:08.140 --> 11:10.215
We have to go
before they regroup.

11:10.637 --> 11:14.411
(SQUEAKING)
How did you induce the shard
to illuminate in that manner?

11:14.559 --> 11:16.790
When I held it up,
it seemed to create something

11:16.876 --> 11:20.022
we all know destroys vampires...
Sunlight.

11:21.881 --> 11:23.248
May I?

11:24.433 --> 11:26.537
Scientific curiosity.

11:26.988 --> 11:29.864
If I could create
my own sunlight,

11:30.137 --> 11:34.292
I could eliminate the vampires'
reign once and for all with this.

11:35.661 --> 11:36.828
Destroying them forever?

11:37.029 --> 11:39.164
Not an option.
Those are innocent people.

11:39.341 --> 11:43.938
Uh, you do know that "vampire"
means they're already dead, right?

11:44.164 --> 11:45.289
We don't know that.

11:45.461 --> 11:47.537
It could just be a virus
or something here.

Permanent end
is not how we roll.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.495
Besides,some of
those vamps were our friends.

11:52.690 --> 11:54.336
There must be some way
to help them.

11:54.532 --> 11:56.247
I'll take that
back now.

of this strange object

13:01.569 --> 13:03.262
and its powers.

13:05.451 --> 13:09.319
An object that destroys
my people?

13:09.444 --> 13:12.455
It could be more than that.
If it can generate light,

13:12.651 --> 13:15.138
maybe there's a way
it can drain light as well.

13:15.302 --> 13:17.208
(GROWLS)

13:17.380 --> 13:20.924
Then perhaps it could
darken the very sun,

13:21.067 --> 13:24.747
allowing us to roam
freely in the day.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.538
I suspect so, sire.

13:26.682 --> 13:28.672
Certainly with
your knowledge of Alchemy,

13:28.718 --> 13:30.775
you'll be able
to repurpose that fragment.
