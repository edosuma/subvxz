<i>In the last episode of</i> Soap,

00:05.071 --> 00:06.572
<i>Jessica believes</i>
<i>that Chester is dead,</i>

00:06.573 --> 00:07.573
<i>but he is not,</i>

00:07.574 --> 00:09.575
<i>and, banging his head,</i>

00:09.576 --> 00:11.076
<i>he's now remembered</i>
<i>he's Chester Tate,</i>

00:11.077 --> 00:13.078
<i>and is on his way home,</i>
<i>if it's not too late.</i>

00:13.079 --> 00:15.080
<i>At home, of course,</i>
<i>Donohue and Jess</i>

00:15.081 --> 00:18.083
<i>have fallen in love,</i>
<i>as you probably guessed.</i>

00:18.084 --> 00:20.085
<i>Mary told Burt what Sally said.</i>

00:20.086 --> 00:21.086
<i>He said she lied.</i>

00:21.087 --> 00:23.088
<i>Mary said, "Drop dead."</i>

00:23.089 --> 00:25.090
<i>Corinne gave birth</i>
<i>to a baby boy,</i>

00:25.091 --> 00:27.593
<i>but Tim, in a cave,</i>
<i>couldn't share the joy.</i>

00:27.594 --> 00:29.094
<i>Very confused?</i>

00:29.095 --> 00:30.095
<i>Do you feel like a dope?</i>

00:30.096 --> 00:32.098
<i>You won't, if you</i>
<i>stay tuned for...</i> Soap.

00:37.604 --> 00:40.105
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of two sisters,</i>

00:40.106 --> 00:42.107
<i>Jessica Tate</i>

00:42.108 --> 00:44.610
<i>and Mary Campbell.</i>

00:44.611 --> 00:48.113
<i>These are the Tates,</i>

00:48.114 --> 00:51.617
<i>and these are the Campbells.</i>

00:51.618 --> 00:54.621
<i>And this is...</i> Soap.

01:18.645 --> 01:19.645
Oof.

01:44.170 --> 01:46.171
Go back to bed, Corinne.
I'll do it.

01:46.172 --> 01:47.172
No, I'll do it.

01:47.173 --> 01:48.674
Come on.

01:48.675 --> 01:51.176
Shh. If I argue with you,
I'll wake up.

01:51.177 --> 01:52.678
Go to bed.

01:52.679 --> 01:55.681
Oh, God, I'm waking up!

01:55.682 --> 01:57.683
Then go to sleep, Corinne.

01:57.684 --> 01:58.684
Where's the door?

01:58.685 --> 01:59.685
This is it.

02:04.691 --> 02:07.192
This is wonderful.

02:07.193 --> 02:09.695
Every four hours,
that baby wakes up to eat,

02:09.696 --> 02:12.197
and every four hours
when that baby wakes up to eat,

02:12.198 --> 02:14.199
it wakes me up, and I eat too.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.701
By the time
he sleeps through the night,

02:15.702 --> 02:18.203
I'll weigh 400 pounds.

02:18.204 --> 02:23.208
What kind of men
are they drafting these days?

02:23.209 --> 02:24.710
Come on, Gramps.

02:26.212 --> 02:27.713
Listen to him.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.715
We're all homesick,

02:29.716 --> 02:31.718
but do you hear us
carrying on like that?

02:37.724 --> 02:38.724
Hi, Benson.

02:38.725 --> 02:40.726
Hi, Mary.

02:40.727 --> 02:42.728
Did the baby wake you up too?

02:42.729 --> 02:44.229
No.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.731
All of you woke me up.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.233
The baby don't bother me at all.

02:48.234 --> 02:50.235
It's the rest of you.

02:50.236 --> 02:51.737
Now, I made up a schedule.

02:51.738 --> 02:53.238
You've got this feeding.

02:53.239 --> 02:54.239
Corinne's got
the 7:00,

02:54.240 --> 02:55.741
Eunice has got
the 11:00,

02:55.742 --> 02:57.242
and so on and so on and so on.

02:57.243 --> 02:59.244
That way, you all can
stop arguing about it

02:59.245 --> 03:02.248
and not wake me up.

03:03.750 --> 03:07.252
Benson, I notice that your name
isn't on this list.

03:07.253 --> 03:08.754
Don't you want
to take a feeding?

03:08.755 --> 03:09.755
No, thanks.

03:09.756 --> 03:12.258
I never eat this late at night.

03:16.763 --> 03:17.763
Hi, Mary.

03:17.764 --> 03:19.264
Hi.

03:19.265 --> 03:21.266
What in the world
are you doing up this late?

03:21.267 --> 03:22.768
It's 3:00 in the morning.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.269
Letting Corinne sleep.

03:24.270 --> 03:25.771
Oh.

03:25.772 --> 03:26.772
How was your date?

03:26.773 --> 03:28.774
Very nice.

03:28.775 --> 03:31.777
Oh, tell me everything
that happened.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.779
Well, I went to his apartment.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.280
Yes.

03:35.281 --> 03:36.782
And he cooked dinner!

03:36.783 --> 03:37.783
Yeah.

03:37.784 --> 03:40.786
And we ate it.

03:40.787 --> 03:41.787
And then?

03:41.788 --> 03:43.789
And then, uh, we had dessert.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.791
Jessie, get to the good part.

03:45.792 --> 03:48.293
This is the good part.

03:48.294 --> 03:50.295
Didn't you go to bed with him?

03:50.296 --> 03:52.798
No.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.299
No?

03:54.300 --> 03:58.303
No.

03:58.304 --> 03:59.305
Oh, Jess.

04:01.808 --> 04:05.311
Gee, you sound more disappointed
than he did.

04:08.314 --> 04:09.815
I thought you liked him.

04:09.816 --> 04:12.317
I do.
I do, and I wanted to.

04:12.318 --> 04:13.318
I mean, I really did.

04:13.319 --> 04:16.822
But then when it came time to...

04:16.822 --> 04:18.322
Well, I couldn't.

04:18.324 --> 04:20.325
I mean, I... I just couldn't
be unfaithful to Chester.

04:20.326 --> 04:23.328
Jessie, Chester is dead.

04:23.329 --> 04:24.830
And even when he was alive,

04:24.831 --> 04:25.831
he was no saint.

04:25.832 --> 04:27.833
Mm.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.835
If it was me, I'd jump
at the chance.

04:29.836 --> 04:31.336
I can't wait to have an affair.

04:31.337 --> 04:35.340
Mary, Burt is still alive.

04:35.341 --> 04:38.343
What difference does that make?

04:38.344 --> 04:40.345
We're finished.

04:40.346 --> 04:41.346
The man has slept in more beds

04:41.347 --> 04:42.348
than Washington.

04:45.351 --> 04:47.352
I want an affair.

04:47.353 --> 04:51.857
I want a beautiful,
storybook, romantic,

04:51.858 --> 04:54.359
never-to-be-forgotten
affair,

04:54.360 --> 04:57.863
and if I can't have that,

04:57.864 --> 04:59.866
I'll settle
for a one-night stand.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.869
I had an affair once.

05:03.870 --> 05:06.371
I know.

05:06.372 --> 05:08.373
I don't think I like them.

05:08.374 --> 05:09.374
Why?

05:09.375 --> 05:10.876
Well, I don't know.

05:10.877 --> 05:12.377
There's something really nice

05:12.378 --> 05:15.881
about being with
one person all your life.

05:15.882 --> 05:19.384
I mean, you don't have
to explain your scars to him,

05:19.385 --> 05:22.387
and you don't have to keep your
chin all up all the time...

05:22.388 --> 05:24.890
you know, so it doesn't double...

05:24.891 --> 05:27.893
and you don't have to lie
in the one position

05:27.894 --> 05:29.395
where nothing sags.

05:32.899 --> 05:36.401
I mean, Mary, try making love
propped up on one elbow

05:36.402 --> 05:38.404
with your hand behind your head.

05:40.907 --> 05:43.408
Oh, my God, you're right.

05:43.409 --> 05:45.410
And in the morning...

05:45.411 --> 05:46.912
To be seen in the morning?

05:48.414 --> 05:52.417
I mean, Burt's used to me,
but a strange man?

05:52.418 --> 05:55.921
I mean, he'd take one look at me
and leave the bed in a rocket.

05:55.922 --> 05:58.423
Well, an affair is one thing,

05:58.424 --> 06:01.426
but love is something else.

06:01.427 --> 06:04.429
I've even scared myself
in the morning.

06:04.430 --> 06:05.931
Detective Donohue loves me.

06:05.932 --> 06:07.933
You know, Mary, I don't think

06:07.934 --> 06:09.935
that he would care
what I looked like.

06:09.936 --> 06:11.436
I could have an affair

06:11.437 --> 06:15.440
only if the man was blindfolded.

06:15.441 --> 06:18.944
Detective Donohue
thinks I'm wonderful,

06:18.945 --> 06:20.946
and because he loves me,

06:20.947 --> 06:23.448
I'm the most beautiful thing
that ever lived.

06:23.449 --> 06:26.451
Oh, Jessie, do you realize

06:26.452 --> 06:28.453
that because of the way
I look in the morning

06:28.454 --> 06:30.956
I can never have an affair?

06:30.957 --> 06:31.958
I could kill Burt.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.460
Mary?

06:35.461 --> 06:39.464
I'm going to have an affair
with Detective Donohue.

06:39.465 --> 06:40.966
Now?

06:40.967 --> 06:42.968
No, silly.

06:42.969 --> 06:43.969
I have to get some sleep.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.470
I want to look my best.

06:45.471 --> 06:48.474
I mean, love may be blind,
but there's a limit.

06:58.985 --> 06:59.985
Who is it?

06:59.986 --> 07:02.488
United Parcel.

07:06.993 --> 07:08.493
Oh, you lied!

07:08.494 --> 07:10.996
I lied?
I lied? Me?

07:10.997 --> 07:11.997
You tell my wife

07:11.998 --> 07:14.499
I've been in more motels
than the Gideon Bible,

07:14.500 --> 07:16.001
and I lied?

07:16.002 --> 07:17.502
Don't hurt me.

07:17.503 --> 07:18.503
Please, don't hurt me.

07:18.504 --> 07:20.005
Sit down, Sally.

07:20.006 --> 07:22.007
My God, you're gonna kill me!
He's gonna kill me!

07:22.008 --> 07:23.008
I ought to.

07:23.009 --> 07:25.510
Oh, Burt, please.
I had to do it. I had to.

07:25.511 --> 07:26.511
You don't...

07:26.512 --> 07:28.013
Don't shoot!
Please, don't shoot!

07:28.014 --> 07:29.014
What? Who's...
What's shooting?

07:29.015 --> 07:30.015
Help! Help!

07:30.016 --> 07:32.017
He's gonna kill me! Help!

07:32.018 --> 07:34.519
This is New York.
Who's gonna come?

07:34.520 --> 07:36.021
Help! Oh, please!

07:36.022 --> 07:39.024
Sally, Sally, Sally, hang on.

07:39.025 --> 07:41.026
Now, I'm not here to kill you.

07:41.027 --> 07:43.528
Please. Now, just
shut up and sit down.

07:43.529 --> 07:45.530
You're not
gonna kill me? No.

07:45.531 --> 07:47.532
Do you swear?
I swear to you.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.535
Sit down.

07:52.038 --> 07:54.539
I'm here... I'm here to find out
why you did what you did.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.541
Why you told Mary
the things you told her.

07:56.542 --> 07:59.044
I can't tell you.

07:59.045 --> 08:01.046
You can't tell me?

08:01.047 --> 08:02.547
No.

08:02.548 --> 08:05.050
I spend one drunk night here
that I don't even remember,

08:05.051 --> 08:07.552
and you tell my wife
I've been sleeping with you,

08:07.553 --> 08:09.554
a pom-pom girl,
and Grandma Moses,

08:09.555 --> 08:11.056
and you can't tell me why?

08:11.057 --> 08:13.058
That's right.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.559
Killing's looking
like a great idea here.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.061
If it's any help,

08:16.062 --> 08:17.562
the reason you can't remember

08:17.563 --> 08:21.066
what you did
the night you were here

08:21.067 --> 08:23.069
is because
you didn't do anything.

08:27.073 --> 08:29.074
I didn't do anything?

08:29.075 --> 08:30.575
That's right.

08:30.576 --> 08:33.078
You mean I admitted
something awful to Mary

08:33.078 --> 08:34.578
that I never even did?

08:34.580 --> 08:35.580
I'm sorry.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.586
We didn't?

08:41.587 --> 08:43.087
You couldn't.

08:43.089 --> 08:44.089
I couldn't, so we didn't?

08:44.090 --> 08:45.590
I'm not saying we wouldn't,

08:45.591 --> 08:48.093
but you couldn't, so we didn't.

08:48.094 --> 08:50.095
But you would have
if I could have? Of course.

08:50.096 --> 08:51.096
But we didn't?
We didn't.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.597
Oh, God! I gotta tell Mary.

08:52.598 --> 08:54.099
Come with me. She's
never gonna believe me.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.100
I can't!

08:55.101 --> 08:57.102
I've gotta get
out of town. No, Sally...

08:57.103 --> 08:59.104
Oh, my God. Burt! Quick, hide.

08:59.105 --> 09:00.605
Hide... Who am I
hiding from?

09:00.606 --> 09:02.107
Get in the closet!

09:02.108 --> 09:04.109
Why am I hiding?
I can't tell you. Please.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.112
Fine.
I'm not hiding.

09:07.613 --> 09:09.114
I'm... being blackmailed.

09:09.115 --> 09:11.616
Yeah, so?

09:11.617 --> 09:14.119
So if you think things have
been bad for you up until now,

09:14.120 --> 09:16.200
if you're seen here,
they're going to get much worse.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.624
I gotta hide.

09:29.635 --> 09:33.639
So how's the little
home wrecker?

09:36.142 --> 09:38.143
Going somewhere?

09:38.144 --> 09:39.144
Listen, I did what you asked.

09:39.145 --> 09:40.145
Just give me the film.

09:40.146 --> 09:42.647
The Campbells are apart?

09:42.648 --> 09:43.648
Yes.

09:43.649 --> 09:45.150
And they are miserable?

09:45.151 --> 09:46.151
Yes.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.652
Destroyed?

09:47.653 --> 09:49.154
They're miserable.
You said you wanted miserable.

09:49.155 --> 09:51.656
I want them destroyed!

09:51.657 --> 09:53.158
They're destroyed.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.159
It's hard to tell.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.660
They're so miserable

09:55.661 --> 09:57.162
you could hardly even see
a facial expression.

09:57.163 --> 10:00.665
And this is just the beginning.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.167
This is just practice.

10:02.168 --> 10:05.670
I will wipe out
both those sisters

10:05.671 --> 10:08.173
for taking my Corinne from me.

10:08.174 --> 10:12.177
You haven't seen nothing yet.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.678
I'm sure we haven't.

10:13.679 --> 10:15.180
Could I please just have...

10:15.181 --> 10:17.682
You know, I sort of hate
to give it up.

10:17.683 --> 10:20.685
It's so original.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.687
Tell me, where in the world

10:22.688 --> 10:26.191
did you find all those midgets?

10:26.192 --> 10:30.195
Ah, the magic of celluloid.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.696
Here.

10:31.697 --> 10:34.699
Love the hot tub sequence.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.703
I am surprised you didn't drown.

10:41.707 --> 10:43.208
I don't believe it.

10:43.209 --> 10:45.210
She's back?

10:45.211 --> 10:46.211
I just don't believe that.

10:46.212 --> 10:48.213
Oh, Burt.

10:48.214 --> 10:51.216
I'm so sorry.

10:51.217 --> 10:52.717
Oh, Sally, come on.
It's all right.

10:52.718 --> 10:55.220
Don't cry, now.
It's over. It's all over.

10:55.221 --> 10:58.223
What I did to you
is so horrible.

10:58.224 --> 11:00.226
Come on.
It's all right.

11:01.727 --> 11:04.229
My brother was sick.

11:04.230 --> 11:07.232
I mean, he was really sick,

11:07.233 --> 11:09.735
and he needed money,
so I did this.

11:11.737 --> 11:13.738
I'm so ashamed.

11:13.739 --> 11:15.740
Oh, Sally, what a shame.
Don't be...

11:15.741 --> 11:17.242
Come on, what you did
for your brother

11:17.243 --> 11:20.745
and your family here was...
was a wonderful thing.

11:20.746 --> 11:22.247
I think
you're a very brave lady.

11:22.248 --> 11:26.251
I'm rotten and I'm ashamed.

11:26.252 --> 11:27.252
Sally, come on.

11:27.253 --> 11:28.754
Don't talk like that.

11:30.256 --> 11:31.757
Ho...

11:34.260 --> 11:36.261
Holy cow!

11:36.262 --> 11:38.763
How can I ever face you again?

11:38.764 --> 11:41.766
Good God.

11:41.767 --> 11:43.268
Burt, forgive me.

11:43.269 --> 11:44.769
Hey, it's okay.

11:44.770 --> 11:47.272
It's just everything is...
everything is...

11:48.774 --> 11:50.776
Boy, are you limber.

11:52.778 --> 11:54.279
I'll disappear, Burt.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.782
I'm gonna get on a plane,
and I'm gonna go far away.

11:57.783 --> 12:00.285
I'll never hurt you again.

12:00.286 --> 12:01.786
Oh, God forgive me!

12:01.787 --> 12:03.788
Ah, Sally, don't worry, he will,

12:03.789 --> 12:05.790
and... and... and Mary will,
and I do already,

12:05.791 --> 12:07.292
so you see, everything's okay.

12:07.293 --> 12:08.794
Come on. Everything's fine.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.797
You're so good.

12:12.798 --> 12:14.799
Come on.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.803
God bless you, Burt.

12:19.805 --> 12:20.806
Ha!

12:22.308 --> 12:23.309
Aah.

12:36.822 --> 12:39.324
Come in, Danny.

12:39.325 --> 12:40.325
How are you?

12:40.326 --> 12:41.326
I'll tell you how I am.

12:41.327 --> 12:42.827
I'm exhausted.

12:42.828 --> 12:44.329
I haven't slept in days.

12:44.330 --> 12:46.832
Now, Jodie, we've got to get Mom
and Burt back together again.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.834
Burt is going crazy.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.836
He comes in my room
in the middle of the night,

12:51.837 --> 12:53.838
and he shakes my mattress
until I fall out of bed,

12:53.839 --> 12:55.340
and then he says,

12:55.341 --> 12:57.843
"Huh, huh, you couldn't sleep
either, huh?"

12:59.845 --> 13:01.846
Then he sits there
until the sun comes up

13:01.847 --> 13:03.848
asking me,
"What's it all about?"

13:03.849 --> 13:04.849
Well, I'm so exhausted,

13:04.850 --> 13:06.351
even if I knew
what it was all about,

13:06.352 --> 13:07.852
I couldn't tell him.

13:07.853 --> 13:09.354
Now, we gotta get them
back together again.

13:09.355 --> 13:11.857
So you can sleep?
Noble, Danny.

13:13.859 --> 13:16.361
No, no, not so I can sleep.

13:16.362 --> 13:17.362
Look, they love each other.

13:17.363 --> 13:18.363
They should be together.

13:18.364 --> 13:19.864
And I believe Burt.

13:19.865 --> 13:24.369
I think he's telling the truth,
but Mom won't listen to him.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.871
Talk to her, Jodie.
She listens to you.

13:26.872 --> 13:27.872
She takes your advice.

13:27.873 --> 13:29.874
Yeah, on decorating.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.376
Everything's cleaned up...

13:31.377 --> 13:33.878
Oh, excuse me. I didn't
know you had company.

13:33.879 --> 13:35.380
Hello.

13:35.381 --> 13:37.382
How do you do?
It's nice meeting you.

13:37.383 --> 13:38.883
Bye.

13:38.884 --> 13:40.886
That's Alice.

13:42.388 --> 13:43.889
She... lives here.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.892
Sort of.

13:47.893 --> 13:50.895
All right!

13:50.896 --> 13:52.397
Uh, uh, Danny...

13:52.398 --> 13:53.398
You son of a gun, you!

13:53.399 --> 13:55.400
I knew if I took you
to enough hockey games,

13:55.401 --> 13:57.402
you'd see the light.

13:57.403 --> 13:58.403
Whoa, Dan.

13:58.404 --> 14:00.405
Son of a gun.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.407
She's pretty.
She's sexy.

14:02.408 --> 14:03.909
She's gay.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.414
Oh, come on.

14:09.415 --> 14:12.918
You almost had me going
there for a minute.

14:14.420 --> 14:15.420
Hey, listen.

14:15.421 --> 14:17.422
I hope I'm not getting
out of line or anything,

14:17.423 --> 14:18.923
but I just want you to know

14:18.924 --> 14:20.926
that I'm not trying
to take Jodie away from you.

14:24.430 --> 14:25.930
I beg your pardon?

14:25.931 --> 14:26.931
Uh, Alice...

14:26.932 --> 14:29.934
We share the place,
but we both lead our own lives,

14:29.935 --> 14:32.437
and you two can have
all the privacy you want.

14:32.438 --> 14:35.940
Uh, I... I don't...
I don't understand.

14:35.941 --> 14:37.943
Aren't you his date?

14:45.451 --> 14:46.451
Date?

14:46.452 --> 14:49.455
I mean, why not?
You're gorgeous.

14:51.457 --> 14:53.458
His date?!

14:53.459 --> 14:55.960
Uh, Alice, uh,

14:55.961 --> 14:58.963
this is Danny, my brother.

14:58.964 --> 14:59.964
Brother?

14:59.965 --> 15:02.968
His brother!

15:04.470 --> 15:05.970
Oh. I'm so embarrassed.

15:05.971 --> 15:07.472
I'm sorry, Danny.

15:08.974 --> 15:13.978
Brother. Who knew?

15:13.979 --> 15:15.480
I'll, uh, go make sandwiches.

15:18.484 --> 15:19.984
She's cute.

15:19.985 --> 15:21.486
Now, how could she be gay?

15:21.487 --> 15:22.987
What do you mean?

15:22.988 --> 15:24.989
Well, it's as simple
as the nose on your face.

15:24.990 --> 15:25.990
She's a girl.

15:25.991 --> 15:27.492
So?

15:27.493 --> 15:31.496
So, Jodie, boys are gay.
Boys, not girls.

15:31.497 --> 15:33.498
Is that so?

15:33.499 --> 15:34.499
Yeah.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.501
Yeah, if girls were gay
and boys were gay,

15:36.502 --> 15:39.004
they'd cancel each other out.

15:41.006 --> 15:42.507
<i>Comprendo?</i>

15:45.010 --> 15:46.010
No, Danny.

15:46.011 --> 15:48.513
She really is gay?

15:48.514 --> 15:50.014
Really gay.

15:50.015 --> 15:52.517
A gay woman.

15:52.518 --> 15:55.019
Oh, boy.

15:55.020 --> 15:58.523
Just when you think
you knew it all.

15:58.524 --> 15:59.524
A gay woman.

15:59.525 --> 16:01.025
No, sit.

16:01.026 --> 16:02.026
The sandwiches are coming.

16:02.027 --> 16:03.027
Nah, I gotta go.

16:03.028 --> 16:05.029
What do you mean? I just
made a lot of sandwiches.

16:05.030 --> 16:06.531
No, I can't stay.

16:06.532 --> 16:08.533
I'm... I'm tracking down
some kidnappers.

16:08.534 --> 16:09.534
On an empty stomach?

16:09.535 --> 16:12.036
I never heard of such a thing.

16:12.037 --> 16:14.038
You're still going after them?

16:14.039 --> 16:16.040
Yeah. I got a new lead.

16:16.041 --> 16:18.042
Danny, why don't you
just forget it?

16:18.043 --> 16:21.045
They killed my wife.
You expect me to forget that?

16:21.046 --> 16:22.547
I don't,
but going after them is foolish,

16:22.548 --> 16:24.549
because if you find them
and kill them,

16:24.550 --> 16:26.551
you'll be in trouble,
and if not, they'll kill you.

16:26.552 --> 16:27.552
I'm gonna find them.
They're pros, Danny.

16:27.553 --> 16:29.053
They'll get you.
I know it.

16:29.054 --> 16:30.054
And if they do, I'll...

16:30.055 --> 16:31.055
What?

16:31.056 --> 16:34.559
I'll... get them.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.563
Hey, I'm as big a jerk
as you are.

16:38.564 --> 16:40.064
Be careful, huh?

16:40.065 --> 16:42.067
I will.

16:47.072 --> 16:49.073
Here, I made some for you.

16:49.074 --> 16:51.075
Chasing kidnappers
can make you hungry.

16:51.076 --> 16:52.076
Thanks, Alice.

16:52.077 --> 16:53.077
When you get back,

16:53.078 --> 16:54.579
I'm gonna make you a nice meal.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.082
So long, Jodie's brother.

16:59.585 --> 17:00.585
You'll talk to Ma?

17:00.586 --> 17:01.586
I'll talk to Ma.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.088
All right.
I'll see you later.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.594
She's not gay.

17:25.611 --> 17:27.612
I fell over you.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.113
Are you all right?
Yes, I...

17:29.114 --> 17:31.616
I didn't hurt you, did I?
No. I... I'm fine, really.

17:31.617 --> 17:33.117
I'm such a klutz.

17:33.118 --> 17:34.619
Yes.

17:38.624 --> 17:40.626
Don't move. I have
something for you.

17:43.128 --> 17:44.128
Uh, would you mind

17:44.129 --> 17:46.631
if I brushed my teeth first?

17:46.632 --> 17:49.133
No, no.
You don't understand.

17:49.134 --> 17:50.635
Now, wait right there.

17:53.138 --> 17:55.139
Breakfast in bed.

17:55.140 --> 17:58.142
Oh, I love breakfast in bed.

17:58.143 --> 17:59.644
This is gonna be
a little tricky, though.

17:59.645 --> 18:01.146
The tray has a leg missing.

18:06.652 --> 18:08.653
I don't think
it's going to stand up

18:08.654 --> 18:09.654
with a missing leg.

18:09.655 --> 18:11.155
Well, that's why
I brought this book.

18:11.156 --> 18:12.657
Watch this.

18:14.159 --> 18:15.660
Oh.

18:15.661 --> 18:17.662
It looks wonderful.

18:17.663 --> 18:20.665
It's Rice Krispies.

18:20.666 --> 18:22.166
I love Rice Krispies.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.169
Problem is, there's no milk.

18:25.671 --> 18:26.671
Oh, that's all right.

18:26.672 --> 18:28.673
I... I don't need any milk.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.675
Probably gonna be little dry.

18:30.676 --> 18:33.177
I like them that way, dry.

18:33.178 --> 18:36.180
It keeps them crispier.

18:36.181 --> 18:37.181
If they're too dry,

18:37.182 --> 18:38.783
we could always pour some water
in there.

18:40.185 --> 18:43.187
No, they're delicious.

18:43.188 --> 18:45.690
Hey, this book really works.

18:48.193 --> 18:50.194
Oh, golly.

18:50.195 --> 18:51.696
No, that...
that's all right.

18:51.697 --> 18:53.698
I don't want any more.
I'm full.

18:53.699 --> 18:56.701
Well, I'll be all right
in a year or two,

18:56.702 --> 19:01.205
after I calm down.

19:01.206 --> 19:05.210
Uh, why are you so nervous?

19:07.212 --> 19:09.213
Well, because
I'm crazy about you,

19:09.214 --> 19:11.716
and I don't know if you like me

19:11.717 --> 19:13.218
after last night.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.221
I loved last night.

19:17.222 --> 19:18.723
Couldn't you tell?

19:18.724 --> 19:22.227
I never behaved
like that in my life.

19:23.729 --> 19:24.729
Like what?

19:24.730 --> 19:29.734
Well, I was so, um, so, um...

19:29.735 --> 19:33.738
Loud.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.239
I'm so embarrassed.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.741
No, no, loud is good.

19:36.742 --> 19:37.743
I knew you were there.

19:40.746 --> 19:42.748
You really liked
last night, huh?

19:44.750 --> 19:47.251
I think you're
a wonderful lover.

19:47.252 --> 19:48.253
Think so?

19:49.755 --> 19:52.757
Yeah.

19:52.758 --> 19:56.761
People have told me
I'm an animal.

19:56.762 --> 19:58.262
You know at one point
you screamed?

19:58.263 --> 19:59.263
Yeah.

19:59.264 --> 20:00.765
When you got caught in the sheet

20:00.766 --> 20:02.267
and knocked the lamp on my head.

20:12.778 --> 20:15.780
I think I'm in love with you.

20:15.781 --> 20:18.283
I think I love you too.

20:20.285 --> 20:22.287
Will you marry me?

20:24.289 --> 20:26.291
Well, we have lots of time.

20:27.793 --> 20:30.294
Yeah, you're right.

20:30.295 --> 20:32.797
So you think
I'm a good lover, huh?

20:32.798 --> 20:34.799
Mm-hmm.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.300
What about me is good?

20:36.301 --> 20:41.306
Well... you're gentle
and, uh, considerate.

20:43.809 --> 20:44.809
That's it?

20:44.810 --> 20:45.810
That's what makes me good...

20:45.811 --> 20:47.812
gentle and considerate?

20:47.813 --> 20:49.814
That makes a good pediatrician.

20:49.815 --> 20:52.316
Well, that's not all.

20:52.317 --> 20:53.317
What else?

20:56.321 --> 20:58.823
Come on, you can tell me.

20:58.824 --> 21:00.325
Come on.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.334
I think that's hereditary.

21:13.839 --> 21:15.841
Me and my sister.

21:31.356 --> 21:32.356
I hate to leave you.

21:32.357 --> 21:34.859
I hate for you to leave me.

21:34.860 --> 21:35.860
I'll miss you.

21:35.861 --> 21:38.362
I'll miss you too.

21:38.363 --> 21:39.363
I love you.

21:39.364 --> 21:40.865
I love you too.

21:42.868 --> 21:46.370
Well, Mrs. Tate,
nice bumping into you.

21:46.371 --> 21:48.873
Hi there, Benson.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.374
Do you know what time it is?

21:50.375 --> 21:51.375
Gee, no, I'm sorry.
I don't.

21:51.376 --> 21:53.878
Do you know what
time it is? No, uh, sorry.

21:53.879 --> 21:55.379
It's 8:00 in the morning!

21:55.380 --> 21:57.882
Well, thank you.

21:57.883 --> 22:00.384
You couldn't call?

22:00.385 --> 22:02.386
Oh, Benson, you were worried?

22:02.387 --> 22:04.388
No, no, no.
I wasn't worried.

22:04.389 --> 22:05.890
You were.
You were worried.

22:05.891 --> 22:07.391
No, no, no, no,
I wasn't worried.

22:10.395 --> 22:13.398
Next time,
I'm gonna break your neck.

22:14.399 --> 22:15.400
Benson...

22:21.406 --> 22:22.907
Who's at the door, Benson?

22:23.909 --> 22:26.912
I'm not sure.

22:33.418 --> 22:35.920
You want me to get that?

22:37.422 --> 22:38.923
If you don't mind.

22:38.924 --> 22:41.425
You don't want me to get that.

22:41.426 --> 22:42.927
Yes, I do.

22:42.928 --> 22:44.428
No, you don't.

22:44.429 --> 22:45.930
Benson...

22:56.441 --> 22:57.442
I'm home.

22:59.945 --> 23:01.445
Chester...

23:01.446 --> 23:02.446
Chester.

23:02.447 --> 23:04.949
Chester...

23:06.451 --> 23:08.953
I'm home, Jessica.

23:08.954 --> 23:09.954
I'm home.

23:09.955 --> 23:11.455
And I remember.

23:11.456 --> 23:12.957
Chester?

23:12.958 --> 23:13.958
Oh, Jessica.

23:13.959 --> 23:17.962
Oh, my darling, darling Jessica.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.463
You must have been worried sick.

23:19.464 --> 23:20.965
She is now.

23:31.977 --> 23:33.477
<i>Is this the last time</i>

23:33.478 --> 23:35.479
<i>Ingrid will bother</i>
<i>the Tates and Campbells?</i>

23:35.480 --> 23:37.982
<i>And if not,</i>
<i>isn't it enough already?</i>

23:37.983 --> 23:39.984
<i>Will Jodie and Danny</i>
<i>be successful</i>

23:39.985 --> 23:41.986

23:41.987 --> 23:42.987

23:42.988 --> 23:44.488

23:44.489 --> 23:45.489
<i>in getting her to believe</i>

23:45.490 --> 23:47.992
<i>that he hasn't slept</i>
<i>with anyone?</i>

23:47.993 --> 23:49.994
<i>Now that Jessica and Donohue</i>

23:49.995 --> 23:52.997
