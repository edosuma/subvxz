01:30.757 --> 01:32.293
You done
with your breakfast?

01:32.392 --> 01:33.427
Yeah.

01:33.527 --> 01:34.528
Let's do this thing.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.873
I'll see you later.
Okay.

01:38.365 --> 01:40.242
Drive safe.
Bye, Mom.

01:42.569 --> 01:44.242
- You got your lunch?
- Yeah.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.495
Mrs. Peterson?

02:38.759 --> 02:42.104
Yes. Can I, um,
help you?

02:43.296 --> 02:45.503
My name is David,
Mrs. Peterson.

02:45.599 --> 02:46.805
I, uh...

02:46.867 --> 02:48.778
I knew your son Caleb.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.145
We trained together
and served together

02:51.204 --> 02:53.844
and, uh, well, we came
to be good friends.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.719
Oh, um...

02:58.779 --> 03:00.816
Would you like
to come inside?

03:01.782 --> 03:04.126
Thank you, ma'am.

03:13.226 --> 03:16.298
So, are you sure
I can't get you anything?

03:16.797 --> 03:19.573
Mmm-hmm. Maybe just some
water would be nice.

03:26.506 --> 03:27.746
How did you get here?

03:28.642 --> 03:30.383
I ran.

03:30.477 --> 03:31.979
I needed the exercise.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.090
From the bus station,
I mean, in town.

03:35.515 --> 03:37.222
You ran that whole way?

03:37.317 --> 03:38.489
Yes, ma'am.

03:41.254 --> 03:42.255
Here you go.

03:42.355 --> 03:43.834
All right.
Thank you, ma'am.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.248
When did you get out?

03:57.938 --> 04:00.441
Well, I was discharged
on Wednesday

04:00.540 --> 04:02.713
and I came straight here
from Fort Kennilworth.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.585
You came straight
here first thing?

04:05.112 --> 04:09.219
Yeah. I wanted to come by sooner,
but I couldn't get leave.

04:09.883 --> 04:10.884
Why?

04:11.618 --> 04:13.338
Well, I was discharged
'cause I was wounded.

04:13.386 --> 04:15.798
I was in a military
hospital for a bit,

04:15.889 --> 04:17.197
so it wasn't really
the kind of thing

04:17.257 --> 04:18.736
you could get leave from.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.565
Ah, but don't worry, it was just
a bit of shrapnel in my back.

04:21.628 --> 04:22.902
I'm right as rain now.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.603
No, I meant, urn, why did
you come here first thing?

04:25.699 --> 04:29.613
Ah, well, like I said, me and
your son Caleb, we were, uh...

04:31.037 --> 04:32.641
We were pretty close.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.050
I was with him
when he died.

04:39.479 --> 04:41.254
Really?
Yes, ma'am.

04:41.548 --> 04:46.793
And one of the things he asked
was for me to check on you all.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.291
You and your whole
family here. Uh...

04:51.825 --> 04:54.499
He wanted me to tell you
that he loved you.

04:56.563 --> 04:59.567
He specifically wanted me
to tell each one of you that

05:00.734 --> 05:01.734
he loved you and

05:01.768 --> 05:03.270
he was thinking of you guys
up until the end.

05:03.336 --> 05:06.840
I said I'd do that
and so, here I am.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.951
Would you
excuse me, please?

05:50.450 --> 05:51.451
That's me.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.393
Right there.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.495
Well, I'll be...

06:03.029 --> 06:04.975
I remember that day.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.812
It wasn't my intention
to upset you, ma'am.

06:14.574 --> 06:16.383
I probably should
have called first,

06:17.544 --> 06:19.717
but I don't own
a cell phone yet

06:20.714 --> 06:22.314
and, um, I guess,
I just wasn't thinking.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.555
I'm going to be
on my way now,

06:23.650 --> 06:25.357
but I'd like it if
we could exchange e-mails...

06:25.418 --> 06:26.488
Wait. No.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.230
Anna, Caleb's sister,
she works nights,

06:29.322 --> 06:30.392
and she sleeps late.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.492
And I know she would
love to meet you.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.164
Would you stay
a little while longer?

06:35.829 --> 06:37.240
Oh, you're not just saying
that to be polite now?

06:37.330 --> 06:38.331
'Cause you don't need to be.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.345
No, I'm not.
Please, stay. It's...

06:42.369 --> 06:43.677
It's nice having you here

06:43.737 --> 06:47.207
and I would love to hear
more about you and Caleb.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.411
Well, all right.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.921
...Caleb and me,
we figure that sounds, uh,

07:09.930 --> 07:11.534
more like a challenge
than anything else.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.602
So, uh, that night
after he falls asleep,

07:14.701 --> 07:17.648
we kind of crept over to his
cot with a tube of superglue.

07:17.737 --> 07:18.807
Oh, no!

07:19.039 --> 07:20.780
We didn't do anything
too bad to him,

07:20.907 --> 07:23.717
though, uh, we could have, you know.

07:25.712 --> 07:28.921
Hey, there you are.
Anna, this is David.

07:30.216 --> 07:31.786
Very nice to meet you.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.728
Caleb told me
a lot about you.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.399
David just got
discharged this week.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.128
He was a friend
of your brother's.

07:37.791 --> 07:38.929
You knew Caleb?

07:39.326 --> 07:40.566
Yes, ma'am.

07:42.228 --> 07:43.400
"Yes, ma'am"

07:44.064 --> 07:45.065
Okay.

07:46.599 --> 07:48.237
So, um,
where are you staying?

07:49.235 --> 07:52.739
Well, I noticed a motel off the
highway on the way here...

07:52.806 --> 07:54.843
No, no, no, no. You will stay
with us while you're here.

07:54.941 --> 07:56.978
Oh, no.
I couldn't put you all out.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.455
Nonsense. We would love to have you.
We have plenty of room.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.788
In fact, you can
stay in Caleb's old room.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.790
We insist.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.763
Well, I won't argue.

08:06.686 --> 08:08.927
Just for tonight, though.

08:09.689 --> 08:12.033
Well, I've got to
head to the diner.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.971
It was really
great meeting you.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.136
Likewise.
Very nice meeting you.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.676
I guess
I'll see you later.
Bye.

08:19.833 --> 08:20.834
Um...

08:20.934 --> 08:23.005
Can I show you to your room?

08:23.336 --> 08:24.337
Great.

08:25.538 --> 08:28.678
There are clean towels
in the bathroom

08:28.775 --> 08:31.153
if you'd like
to freshen up.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.852
Mrs. Peterson, are you sure you're
comfortable with me staying in here?

08:37.116 --> 08:38.357
Of course.

08:38.618 --> 08:41.962
I mean, it's not like
it's going to any use.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.296
I think it could be
a good thing for us.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.009
Uh...

08:52.665 --> 08:54.372
I'm gonna go and let
you get settled in.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.378
If you need anything,
just holler.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.477
Oh, my God!

10:06.873 --> 10:08.079
Fucking pussy.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.643
Oh, my God!

10:10.143 --> 10:11.144
Oh.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.656
Oh, it's okay,
little baby, don't cry.
Aw.

10:40.840 --> 10:41.910
Hey, there.

10:42.842 --> 10:44.321
How was your day?

10:44.577 --> 10:45.577
It was good.

10:45.612 --> 10:46.647
Great.

10:52.685 --> 10:55.325
...giving him a chance,
it's that I don't like the idea of

10:55.421 --> 10:57.628
some random guy off the
street being invited to stay

10:57.757 --> 11:01.432
in my house with my family.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.608
So, you knew my brother?

11:08.101 --> 11:12.550
I did, pretty well, yeah.

11:15.475 --> 11:19.821
He wanted me to tell you
that he loved you.

11:23.650 --> 11:24.993
Oh. Thanks.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.158
Even though he says
he was friends with Caleb.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.166
He's in the photograph
of Caleb's squad.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.360
You saw the photograph.

11:30.456 --> 11:31.491
He was not a stranger.
You know what?

11:31.558 --> 11:32.696
What if he has the PTSD

11:32.792 --> 11:33.998
or whatever it's called?

11:34.127 --> 11:36.471
Some of these guys come back with
mental health problems, Laura.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.872
Did you take
that into account?

11:37.964 --> 11:39.637
What if Caleb had
come back different?

11:40.800 --> 11:42.302
Did you take
that into account?

11:45.004 --> 11:46.984
Wow, that is...
Hmm...

11:51.010 --> 11:52.717
Your parents are
fighting about me.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.982
Yeah. They argue a lot.

11:56.849 --> 11:58.021
Huh.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.223
You look like
you got hit or something.

12:05.892 --> 12:09.271
Yeah, yeah, I got hit with
a football in gym class.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.366
Yeah, that can happen.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.339
Yeah.

12:15.602 --> 12:18.082
No, no, you're right,
you're right. Let's talk to him.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.077
Hi, great, okay.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.751
David, we're very happy
to have you here.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.585
I'm gonna have
a beer before dinner.
Can I offer you one?

12:26.679 --> 12:29.250
Well, no, thank you.
No. Okay. Suit yourself.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.022
And dinner is gonna
be ready in an hour.

12:31.117 --> 12:33.290
So, Luke, why don't you
do some homework.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.389
<i>Okay-</i>

12:36.456 --> 12:37.696
David, can I get
you anything?

12:37.757 --> 12:40.067
Oh, no, thank you,
Mrs. Peterson, I'm fine.

12:43.863 --> 12:44.967
<i>Yeah, hit this.</i>

12:45.398 --> 12:48.208
Look out... Shit.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.608
No...

12:54.240 --> 12:57.153
Now? No, I'm good,
but thank you.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.627
So, that friend of your
brother's,
is he sticking around?

13:05.218 --> 13:06.720
I don't know.
I hope not.

13:06.986 --> 13:08.659
Why? You said
you liked him.

13:09.088 --> 13:11.625
I said he seemed nice.
That's not the same thing.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.397
Oh, okay.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.239
Why don't you like him?

13:16.896 --> 13:18.500
I don't not like him.

13:19.766 --> 13:20.972
It's just, I...

13:22.235 --> 13:24.078
I mean, you kind
of knew Caleb.

13:29.008 --> 13:30.248
We've all...

13:33.079 --> 13:35.685
I just know Mom and Dad
have been trying to move on

13:36.015 --> 13:38.825
and it's not like they don't have
enough reminders in this town.

13:39.018 --> 13:40.019
Yeah.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.258
I don't know, that seems
pretty normal to me.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.769
You know, like, your kid dies.
That's hard.

13:48.594 --> 13:50.267
Yeah.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.751
Guess we just don't need
a walking, breathing reminder

13:53.800 --> 13:55.780
of him right now,
you know?

13:58.871 --> 14:00.111
Yeah. Totally.

14:02.942 --> 14:04.615
I've got to go.

14:08.214 --> 14:10.353
Hey, wait a second.
Wait a second.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.622
Stop. I can't...
What!

14:11.684 --> 14:13.844
No, no.
Let's just hang out,
like, a little bit longer.

14:13.986 --> 14:15.158
I can't.
Just a little bit longer.

14:15.221 --> 14:16.495
I can't. Mmm-mmm.
I have to go.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.365
You don't have to go.
Yes, I do.

14:18.725 --> 14:21.228
But I'm sure
we can find some time
at Kristen's tomorrow, okay?

14:21.327 --> 14:22.829
Hmm.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.312
Stop, I have to go.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.974
The sine is the angle
of the ship's anchor cable,

14:34.140 --> 14:35.551
so the cable is
the hypotenuse,

14:35.641 --> 14:36.847
and what we need
to find out

14:36.909 --> 14:38.855
is the distance down
to the ocean bottom,

14:39.479 --> 14:41.925
so that's the opposite.
Do you see?

14:44.250 --> 14:45.524
Not really.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.600
So, you're kind
of smart, huh?

14:55.094 --> 14:56.505
I guess so.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.873
Hey, how was work?

15:02.568 --> 15:04.070
Good. Not too busy.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.841
David, sure I can't
get you a beer?

15:06.105 --> 15:08.278
You know, I will have one.
Thank you.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.183
- I'll take one, too.
- Yeah, I'm sure you will.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.551
I'm 21 in a month.

15:11.611 --> 15:12.954
You can have all the
beer you want then,

15:13.045 --> 15:15.047
assuming you buy it yourself.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.261
Are you helping him
with his homework?

15:23.289 --> 15:25.360
Well, not exactly.

15:29.128 --> 15:31.574
Hey, don't go.
Stick around,
be sociable.

15:31.898 --> 15:34.037
Ugh, I'm kind of tired.
I think I'm gonna lay down.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.470
Okay. Suit yourself.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.812
But Allan,
his name's Allan,

15:44.310 --> 15:45.380
he's only been
there for, what,

15:45.445 --> 15:48.051
like, four years,
but he's got a degree,

15:48.147 --> 15:52.789
so, boom, suddenly he's
regional manager and I'm not.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.489
And that's okay.
I mean, it's okay.

15:57.056 --> 16:00.731
But I know Laura,
I know she's worried.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.932
She wonders if I'm ever,

16:02.995 --> 16:05.339
ever going to
make any money.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.638
Your wife seems
to respect you, sir.

16:10.903 --> 16:11.973
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.248
It is what it is,
you know.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.585
What about you, though?
What about you?
What are your plans?

16:18.945 --> 16:20.618
Figured I'd get on
a bus tomorrow,

16:20.680 --> 16:21.960
head down to Florida
or something

16:22.114 --> 16:23.154
and start looking
for work.

16:23.182 --> 16:24.422
I've done construction
work before.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.259
So, I'm sure
I'll find something.

16:26.352 --> 16:29.356
No, no, no, no, no.
That's crazy.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.199
That's crazy.
You don't know
where you're going.

16:31.290 --> 16:32.826
Stay here for
a couple more days.

16:32.925 --> 16:34.700
No. No, I can't.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.838
I couldn't impose on your
hospitality any longer, sir.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.170
You're not...
Impose on our...

16:39.265 --> 16:41.006
And "sir"?
You're calling me "sir" now?

16:41.100 --> 16:43.205
You gotta stop with the "sir,"
my name's Spencer.

16:43.302 --> 16:45.282
You gotta call me Spencer,
for God sakes.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.442
Okay-
Okay-

16:46.506 --> 16:47.780
All right.
Okay.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.615
So you're
sticking around, right?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.956
You stick around
at least till you know
where you're going.

16:54.113 --> 16:57.651
Well,
maybe just a couple
more days, all right.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.220
Cool, excellent.
It's a deal.

17:03.122 --> 17:05.534
Let's have a couple more
of these to celebrate,

17:05.625 --> 17:07.536
and then I've got
to get off to bed.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.298
God, you can put
your liquor away.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.339
I guess so.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.242
I'm tired.
Are you tired?

17:15.800 --> 17:17.473
No, I don't need
much sleep.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.216
What are you doing here?

17:56.108 --> 17:58.782
I told your mom
I could pick you up
from school today.

17:59.779 --> 18:00.917
That cool?

18:01.013 --> 18:02.117
Yeah.

18:04.517 --> 18:07.589
Don't you, like,
have any friends?

18:08.354 --> 18:10.061
I have lots of friends.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.270
Just not, like, here.
Like, online.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.476
Oh.

18:33.879 --> 18:35.222
What are you waiting for?

18:35.615 --> 18:37.891
I want you to show me
who hit you yesterday.

18:39.418 --> 18:40.897
I got hit with a football.

18:42.321 --> 18:43.595
Yeah.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.272
What are you going to do?

18:49.562 --> 18:50.597
Nothing bad.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.104
Over there.

18:59.171 --> 19:00.411
All of them?

19:00.573 --> 19:02.917
Well, most of them
give me a hard time.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.650
Those two guys,
Mike and Ian,
are the worst.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.623
Those guys are
real assholes.

19:14.253 --> 19:15.596
Can we go now?

19:18.457 --> 19:19.492
Yes.

19:36.275 --> 19:37.276
What are you doing?

19:37.843 --> 19:39.345
They're going to a bar?

19:40.112 --> 19:41.318
Uh, yeah,

19:41.380 --> 19:43.661
this place will
serve you if you're on
the football team.

19:44.216 --> 19:46.628
Well, I could use a drink.

19:47.219 --> 19:48.289
How about you?

19:49.955 --> 19:50.990
No.

20:10.309 --> 20:11.686
You coming?

20:12.978 --> 20:14.548
No.

20:16.549 --> 20:20.019
Well, I'll be inside
if you change your mind.

20:43.175 --> 20:44.950
What the fuck?

20:47.246 --> 20:48.247
Hey, Luke.

20:54.386 --> 20:56.093
Maybe it's his
boyfriend or something?

21:05.197 --> 21:06.301
Excuse me.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.042
I'm gonna need
to see some ID.

21:17.376 --> 21:18.912
You ID all of them?

21:23.649 --> 21:25.322
What can I get you?

21:25.885 --> 21:27.660
Do you know how
to make a fireball?

21:27.753 --> 21:30.063
Cinnamon schnapps
and Tabasco sauce.

21:30.156 --> 21:32.762
That's my drink of choice.
Let me get one of those.

21:33.058 --> 21:34.765
A Coke here
for my brother,

21:35.394 --> 21:36.634
and I can't help
but notice

21:36.729 --> 21:39.073
that those ladies over there
are drinking cheap beer.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.303
That seems
like a shame to me.

21:40.399 --> 21:42.743
I'd like to buy each one
of them a blowjob shot.

21:44.270 --> 21:47.114
Are you serious?
I am, yes.

21:48.407 --> 21:50.527
Do you wanna buy
anything for their fellas?

21:52.478 --> 21:55.459
Do I look like I'd like to buy
something for their fellas?

21:55.748 --> 21:57.625
Might be the polite
thing to do.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.263
Sure, okay, fine.

22:04.023 --> 22:06.264
I'm gonna get each one of
those guys a cosmopolitan.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.606
Mister, I don't know
what you're going for,

22:09.662 --> 22:11.369
but, uh,
I was thinking a beer.

22:11.597 --> 22:14.510
No. Blowjob shots
for the ladies,

22:14.600 --> 22:16.671
and a cosmopolitan
for each of the guys.

22:17.603 --> 22:19.310
You keep
the change on that.

22:20.105 --> 22:21.140
You got it.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.522
Are you, like, rich?

22:25.845 --> 22:28.553
Cash is easy to get.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.126
He doesn't need to
be in costume

22:38.224 --> 22:39.984
to make an ass out of himself.

22:43.128 --> 22:45.665
Here's your Coke,
here's your fireball.

22:46.131 --> 22:48.168
Got their shots and
cosmos coming right up.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.301
Thank you.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.143
You want to try it?

22:56.542 --> 22:57.646
Sure.

23:04.650 --> 23:05.685
God!

23:08.754 --> 23:10.062
It's like hot peppers.

23:10.723 --> 23:11.758
Ugh, you drink that?

23:12.858 --> 23:13.996
Yep.

23:16.996 --> 23:17.997
Ah!

23:20.399 --> 23:21.707
How do you do that?

23:23.369 --> 23:24.677
You get used to it.

23:41.520 --> 23:42.590
From that
table over there.

23:42.688 --> 23:43.860
That fucking guy?

23:45.524 --> 23:47.026
They look annoyed.

23:47.526 --> 23:48.527
Yep.

23:51.697 --> 23:52.971
Thanks for the drink.

23:55.367 --> 23:56.471
You're welcome.

23:56.702 --> 23:57.874
<i>Mmm.</i>

23:58.637 --> 24:00.639
I don't want it, though.
You can have it.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.936
Well, maybe you prefer this.

24:20.926 --> 24:22.564
Ow! My eyes!

24:23.295 --> 24:24.501
Hey, you...

25:03.769 --> 25:05.009
Hey, Luke.

25:05.838 --> 25:06.839
Luke.

25:13.512 --> 25:14.684
Cool.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.458
You guys should
get out of here.

25:18.984 --> 25:20.544
Call the police
and tell them the truth.

25:21.987 --> 25:23.507
A gang of high school
kids came in here

25:23.555 --> 25:25.000
and demanded
you serve them drinks.

25:25.290 --> 25:27.668
Well, you tried to ID them,

25:27.726 --> 25:29.366
but, uh, they threatened
to cause trouble.

25:29.795 --> 25:31.468
There was a fight.

25:31.964 --> 25:34.137
You didn't really get a good
look at the other guys.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.175
Otherwise, I imagine you
and this place

25:36.235 --> 25:37.714
could get into trouble
for serving minors.

25:37.803 --> 25:39.339
<i>I</i> mean,

25:39.405 --> 25:40.850
this is what happens.

25:43.642 --> 25:44.643
Here.

25:51.683 --> 25:53.162
For the damages.

26:21.013 --> 26:22.617
Luke!
What happened?

26:22.714 --> 26:24.193
I got into a fight
with some guys at school.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.853
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.793
Some seniors
were picking on me.
It's no big deal.

26:27.886 --> 26:29.006
Why were they
picking on you?

26:29.021 --> 26:31.541
I don't know, okay.
I'm just going to go
to my room, all right.

26:33.358 --> 26:34.701
Is he all right?

26:34.760 --> 26:36.205
Yes, ma'am, he's fine.

26:36.295 --> 26:37.899
Did he get in trouble
at the school?

26:38.063 --> 26:41.476
No, no one saw.
It's just the usual
high school stuff, you know.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.643
I told him I'd teach him
some self-defense

26:43.735 --> 26:45.237
when he's feeling up to it.

26:45.471 --> 26:47.075
I'm sure that's exactly
what he needs.

26:48.540 --> 26:51.919
Well, l am very relieved
that you were there.

26:54.379 --> 26:56.120
I'm going to get ready
for Kristen's.

26:56.215 --> 26:58.718
Anna, can we talk
in the kitchen?

26:58.884 --> 26:59.885
Sure.

27:00.586 --> 27:01.587
Excuse us.

27:04.289 --> 27:05.290
What?

27:08.393 --> 27:10.236
Invite him to the party.

27:10.729 --> 27:12.606
- Why?
- 'Cause he's lonely, sweetie.

27:12.664 --> 27:14.166
Caleb would
really love that

27:14.266 --> 27:16.507
Really? You're going
to pull that card?

27:16.602 --> 27:17.945
Yes.

27:20.772 --> 27:23.116
David, would you like to come
to the party with me tonight?

27:23.609 --> 27:25.111
Sure, that sounds nice.

27:26.011 --> 27:27.491
Great. I'm going to
leave around 7:00.

27:28.747 --> 27:30.158
All right.

27:36.121 --> 27:38.658
Luke, I need
to take a shower.

27:41.593 --> 27:42.594
Luke!

27:44.530 --> 27:46.032
Luke, come on,
I need to...

27:46.965 --> 27:48.103
I'm sorry, uh...

27:51.436 --> 27:54.508
Um, no, I'm sorry,

27:54.606 --> 27:56.381
I thought Luke was in there.

27:57.509 --> 28:00.513
Oh, I guess I better
go get dressed.

28:01.980 --> 28:03.186
Yeah, yeah.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.125
You should, um,
probably do that.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.080
So, um, this isn't
a big deal or anything,

28:30.175 --> 28:31.575
but this isn't
just Kristen's place.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.816
My boyfriend, Zeke,
lives here, too.

28:34.146 --> 28:35.921
I didn't know
you had a boyfriend.

28:39.318 --> 28:41.594
Yeah, well,
neither do my parents.

28:41.753 --> 28:43.755
And I wouldn't mind
keeping it that way,
if that's cool with you.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.198
I won't say anything.

28:45.824 --> 28:47.531
It's none of my business.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.043
Hi.
Hey.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.206
Hey, who's this?

29:00.906 --> 29:03.512
Um, this is David, he was
friends with my brother Caleb.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.111
I told you about him.
How do you do?

29:05.677 --> 29:07.122
Mmm, fine, thank you.

29:09.581 --> 29:13.529
Zeke's inside smoking.
He was waiting for help
to carry the kegs.

29:14.353 --> 29:15.696
I'll bring them in.

29:16.855 --> 29:17.925
Where are they?

29:18.724 --> 29:22.570
They're in Zeke's van.
It should be unlocked.

29:38.410 --> 29:39.411
Anna?

29:41.613 --> 29:43.217
No. I can't tonight.
I wish.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.228
What? Really?

29:45.484 --> 29:47.054
What? Your houseguest?

29:47.152 --> 29:48.290
Yeah, he's...

29:48.387 --> 29:49.923
Where do
you want these?

29:57.562 --> 29:59.439
Well, you can
set them right here.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.078
My man,
welcome to the party.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.349
Craig, no.

30:12.444 --> 30:14.117
It's fine.
He's a big boy.

30:14.579 --> 30:15.649
Sure.

30:28.427 --> 30:29.428
Thanks.

30:39.671 --> 30:40.979
Thank you.

30:50.949 --> 30:51.950
Excuse me.

30:55.954 --> 30:56.955
Thank you.

30:58.490 --> 30:59.833
You all right?

30:59.891 --> 31:01.302
Yeah, I'm fine.

31:03.962 --> 31:05.134
You wanna...

31:05.964 --> 31:07.204
Yeah, let's go.

31:23.648 --> 31:24.991
God damn it.

31:27.519 --> 31:28.657
Who are they?

31:30.021 --> 31:32.661
No. That's my ex.
The one I was just
telling you about.

31:38.330 --> 31:41.675
Hey, I need
to talk to you.

31:42.434 --> 31:43.913
I'm busy right now, Drew.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.710
I've been
calling you all week,

31:46.772 --> 31:49.184
and then I hear you're
having a party tonight?

31:49.341 --> 31:50.411
What the fuck?

31:51.176 --> 31:53.247
I'm talking to my friend.
You're being rude.

31:53.345 --> 31:54.517
All right, listen, just...

31:55.514 --> 31:56.515
Come here...

31:57.549 --> 31:58.687
Motherfucker!

32:05.424 --> 32:07.301
Get him out of here.

32:18.904 --> 32:20.315
Sorry about your picture.

32:21.072 --> 32:23.313
No, don't worry about it.

32:25.210 --> 32:26.211
Did you, um...

32:27.879 --> 32:30.416
Did you want to see
the rest of the house?

32:58.910 --> 33:00.253
Are you okay?

33:01.079 --> 33:02.422
Yeah. Why?

33:03.415 --> 33:06.021
Seems like you're
not really into this.

33:07.619 --> 33:08.654
Oh, I am.

33:18.096 --> 33:19.439
Oh...

33:19.598 --> 33:20.941
You are.

33:34.980 --> 33:36.459
Hey, there they are.

33:36.815 --> 33:39.022
Who have you got? I got a queen.
He's got a king.

33:40.285 --> 33:41.491
Sit down.

33:41.620 --> 33:44.965
Thought you guys left your own
party, found something better.

33:45.790 --> 33:48.134
Want some?
No, I'm good.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.901
I just...

33:52.497 --> 33:56.809
I wanted to say
we support you guys.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.642
If you need anything,
you just let me know.

34:02.007 --> 34:03.680
Support us how?

34:05.911 --> 34:07.413
I mean, you know,
we support you,

34:07.512 --> 34:10.322
like, "Go America!" right?

34:10.415 --> 34:13.862
But you wouldn't support us
by, like, enlisting?

34:16.521 --> 34:17.522
Aw...

34:17.656 --> 34:20.068
Shit, man, they don't want
me in there.

34:20.257 --> 34:21.601
No, I can't, you know.

34:21.693 --> 34:23.900
I've got bad asthma.

34:24.161 --> 34:25.242
It'd make it
real hard to...

34:25.330 --> 34:26.400
Hard to what?

34:29.601 --> 34:33.275
Hey, man,
I mean, I just...

34:34.839 --> 34:36.079
What'?

34:36.174 --> 34:37.777
I'm just
fucking with you, man.

34:38.176 --> 34:39.882
Fuck, man.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.085
Oh, you think that's
funny, huh, Kristen?

34:42.179 --> 34:43.625
I'll be right back.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.464
Nice piece of ass there, huh?

34:53.257 --> 34:55.295
Could you get me a gun?

34:57.262 --> 34:58.707
A gun?

35:00.031 --> 35:01.374
Yeah, I can get you a gun.

35:01.433 --> 35:02.878
What do you
need a gun for?

35:03.234 --> 35:05.714
I'm a soldier, man.
I like guns.

35:05.904 --> 35:07.315
Yeah. I know a guy.

35:07.439 --> 35:08.747
You got cash?

35:08.907 --> 35:10.045
I do.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.919
Fuck it.
Give me your number.

35:14.312 --> 35:16.223
I'm using a burner right now.

35:16.281 --> 35:17.385
Number's on the back.

35:20.251 --> 35:22.231
Soldiers like guns.

35:25.090 --> 35:26.933
Landing a gig
is huge for me.

35:27.158 --> 35:28.637
What's the big deal
if I go on tour?

35:28.727 --> 35:30.297
It's, like,
three weeks, max.

35:30.395 --> 35:32.739
Why don't you trust me
for, like, five seconds?

35:32.998 --> 35:34.773
I don't know. Maybe...

35:36.067 --> 35:38.604
I've given you no reason
not to trust me.
I'm done with this.

35:39.004 --> 35:40.005
Come on.

35:43.241 --> 35:45.585
You ready to go?
Sure.

35:59.024 --> 36:01.265
I'll drive.
No, I'm fine.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.039
I'll drive.

36:06.131 --> 36:07.474
You're stoned.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.340
And how are you
more sober than me?

36:11.870 --> 36:13.440
I'm bigger than you.

36:40.565 --> 36:42.135
Please, put on your seat belt.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.693
Do you want to talk about it?
No.

37:03.755 --> 37:04.995
It's just...

37:06.725 --> 37:09.103
It's nothing. I mean,
we got into an argument.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.502
It's old stuff.

37:15.366 --> 37:17.206
You know, I used to love
that he was in a band.

37:18.336 --> 37:21.408
But now I'm saving
money for college,

37:21.606 --> 37:23.586
and he just
isn't moving on.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.211
I mean, he doesn't
even have a job.

37:26.745 --> 37:27.917
Well, he's a drug dealer.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.854
Okay.
He's not a drug dealer.

37:35.887 --> 37:41.701
Yeah. He sells drugs sometimes to,
like, friends for extra cash.

37:43.361 --> 37:45.773
Well, if he's messing
things up with you,
then he's a fool,

37:45.897 --> 37:48.036
and you don't need
to worry about it.

37:48.233 --> 37:49.712
No. I'm serious.

37:50.268 --> 37:53.044
I mean, hell,
if I'd had a girl
like you back home,

37:54.706 --> 37:57.744
I wouldn't have gone over to the
Middle East to get shot at.

38:03.715 --> 38:04.887
Thank you.

38:12.157 --> 38:13.830
I like this music.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.602
You do?

38:22.567 --> 38:24.979
It's, uh, just a mix
that I made.

38:29.007 --> 38:30.953
I can make you one
if you wanted.

38:31.409 --> 38:35.186
Yeah? Can you put
this song on it?

38:36.514 --> 38:38.425
Yeah, I can do that.

38:58.770 --> 39:01.182
So, um, good night.

39:01.606 --> 39:02.778
Good night.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.453
Thanks for inviting me out.

39:06.311 --> 39:07.790
Yeah, no problem.

39:08.813 --> 39:09.814
Good night.

41:05.964 --> 41:08.308
No.
I want to proceed
as we discussed.

41:08.399 --> 41:10.902
No one will be able
to recognize me.
That's important.

41:11.769 --> 41:13.646
What do you mean,
"Dental records"?

41:15.239 --> 41:17.116
An orthodontist?
No, I don't need that.

41:17.408 --> 41:19.081
Fingers, yes.

41:20.111 --> 41:22.421
As soon as possible.
I'm off the grid for now.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.687
But there are people
trying to look for me.

41:25.283 --> 41:29.095
I understand
it'll take some time,
but this is urgent.

41:29.420 --> 41:30.865
I just need a new face.

41:32.657 --> 41:35.763
I'll keep this phone
in case anything comes up
and you need to reach me.

41:35.827 --> 41:37.465
All right. Copy that.

41:39.464 --> 41:41.944
Yeah, his name is
David Andersen Collins.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.208
I can tell you the unit that
he served in if that helps.

41:46.804 --> 41:48.784
No, nothings wrong. Um...

41:48.840 --> 41:51.548
He was friends with my brother
and we heard that he was back,

41:52.110 --> 41:54.181
so, uh, any contact
information would be great.

41:54.812 --> 41:58.350
Okay, ma'am.
I'll call you when
we have any details.

41:59.117 --> 42:00.187
Good bye.

42:16.901 --> 42:19.541
Tell Fort Kennilworth
that David Collins is dead.

42:19.637 --> 42:21.037
Just give them
the official version.

42:21.472 --> 42:23.152
We'll take it from here.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.088
Next week I'm meeting
with the rest of the board

42:26.144 --> 42:29.057
to discuss the future
of our work with the military,

42:29.180 --> 42:31.751
in light of Project
Aegolius' dissolution.

42:32.150 --> 42:35.597
Richard has more information
on that subject. Richard?

42:39.157 --> 42:40.727
I can't get into
too many details,

42:40.825 --> 42:41.997
nor would you want me to.

42:42.260 --> 42:43.900
However, I can say that...

42:45.530 --> 42:48.010
Sorry to interrupt.
Somethings come up.

42:52.904 --> 42:54.906
My apologies, but you'll
have to excuse me.

42:59.510 --> 43:01.353
When did Fort
Kennilworth receive this call?

43:01.412 --> 43:02.550
About an hour ago, sir.

43:02.613 --> 43:03.683
Have you
lD'd the caller?

43:03.848 --> 43:07.091
Not confirmed, but she gave
her name as Anna Peterson.

43:08.186 --> 43:09.756
Peterson.

43:09.854 --> 43:11.197
As in Caleb Peterson?

43:11.355 --> 43:12.698
His sister.

43:12.890 --> 43:14.369
Home address is in there.

43:14.425 --> 43:15.699
Book me on
the next flight.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.034
If we need to charter
something, do it.

43:17.095 --> 43:18.699
And I'm gonna need
some shooters.

43:19.263 --> 43:22.210
If anyone asks
what's happening,
what do I tell them?

43:22.767 --> 43:24.212
Make something up.

43:24.902 --> 43:28.042
No one outside this circle
can know that any of
our subjects are still active.

43:28.106 --> 43:29.779
If KPG gets
any blowback on this,

43:29.874 --> 43:31.785
you and I will both
be hung out to dry.

43:31.876 --> 43:33.150
You got that?
Mmm.

43:33.544 --> 43:35.546
Call me when you
got the plane booked.

43:58.402 --> 43:59.904
I'm not late, am l?

44:01.339 --> 44:03.319
No, no.
You're just on time.

44:05.076 --> 44:06.248
Good.

44:06.410 --> 44:08.412
Look, before
we get started,

44:08.479 --> 44:10.823
I just want to make sure that
you've got some cash on you.

44:10.982 --> 44:12.359
No offense.

44:17.255 --> 44:18.495
That should be good?

44:19.624 --> 44:20.762
It'll do.

44:22.527 --> 44:23.801
Let's get started.

44:29.500 --> 44:30.706
Let's start
with this.

44:30.801 --> 44:32.280
I mean,
it's a standard Beretta.

44:32.370 --> 44:33.678
I'm sure you're
familiar with it.

44:33.771 --> 44:36.945
In my opinion,
if you've seen one of these,
you've seen them all.

44:38.442 --> 44:41.389
But this baby,
this here is

44:41.479 --> 44:43.618
a 9-millimeter
Witness Elite.

44:43.714 --> 44:46.126
It's a very similar weapon
to the Beretta,

44:46.284 --> 44:47.786
but I prefer the recoil.

44:47.852 --> 44:49.627
I mean, it's got absolutely
no kick at all.

45:03.634 --> 45:04.635
You army?

45:05.203 --> 45:06.204
Yes, sir.

45:06.804 --> 45:08.579
I'm navy, myself.

45:14.979 --> 45:16.219
Yeah, that's fine.

45:19.717 --> 45:21.355
You want the Elite?

45:21.419 --> 45:22.864
Oh, I'll take 'em all.

45:24.822 --> 45:26.233
All the handguns?

45:26.424 --> 45:29.405
No. Everything.
All your guns.

45:30.995 --> 45:32.099
Shit.

45:32.997 --> 45:34.067
That's what
I was thinking.

45:34.165 --> 45:36.941
Look, man, if you've brought
money for all of them,

45:37.168 --> 45:39.842
<i>I'll</i> cut you a deal.
You can take 'em
all off my hands.

45:39.904 --> 45:41.349
No, I'm going to kill you.

45:42.506 --> 45:44.543
Hey, what the fuck, David?

45:44.675 --> 45:46.518
Now, you listen to me
one fucking second...

45:46.577 --> 45:47.920
Wait, wait, wait.

45:51.582 --> 45:52.925
No, no, no, no.

46:51.075 --> 46:52.179
Hello?

46:52.943 --> 46:54.581
Yeah, thanks
for calling me back.

47:01.419 --> 47:02.693
What?

47:05.323 --> 47:07.599
Hey, Mom, can I talk
to you for a second?

47:07.658 --> 47:10.002
Sure, sweetie,
what's going on?

47:10.928 --> 47:12.601
Um, I called the army base

47:12.663 --> 47:14.870
that David said
that he was just
discharged from,

47:15.299 --> 47:16.607
I wanted to ask about him.

47:16.701 --> 47:19.511
- What?
- Why would you do that?

47:27.345 --> 47:28.346
Spencer?

47:28.779 --> 47:29.780
I need a drink.

47:29.847 --> 47:32.123
Why? What happened?
I'm getting a drink, honey.

47:32.450 --> 47:34.327
They found Allan,
you know my boss, Allan?

47:34.385 --> 47:36.490
He'd been missing from
work for a couple of days,

47:36.554 --> 47:37.794
everybody got very worried,

47:37.955 --> 47:40.799
so one of his friends
went over and broke
into his house.

47:40.958 --> 47:42.869
And they found him
and his girlfriend dead.

47:44.362 --> 47:46.535
They'd both taken a bunch
of prescription pills,

47:46.630 --> 47:49.873
it was like they committed
suicide together or something.

47:49.967 --> 47:51.469
Oh, my God!

47:51.635 --> 47:54.013
But that doesn't make any sense.
He was...

47:54.071 --> 47:55.641
No. The guy
was totally normal.

47:55.873 --> 47:58.479
But the police are investigating.
You know, it's, uh...

47:59.310 --> 48:00.550
Doesn't look like
it was a break-in.

48:00.644 --> 48:01.884
There was no forced entries.

48:01.979 --> 48:04.084
She, uh... The girl...
She had, uh...

48:05.249 --> 48:06.819
She had bruises
on her body.

48:08.419 --> 48:09.539
I don't know
what that means.

48:10.020 --> 48:12.591
Anyway, uh, we will
leave it for the police

48:12.690 --> 48:14.499
to tell us exactly
what happened.

48:14.558 --> 48:15.935
I don't know.

48:20.364 --> 48:23.902
Damn thing is this makes
me regional manager.

48:25.169 --> 48:28.378
Yeah. As soon as
Corporate found out,
they called me.

48:28.539 --> 48:31.213
Right away they want me
to start tomorrow.

48:31.275 --> 48:33.186
And they're offering
me Allan's salary.

48:33.344 --> 48:34.687
So...

48:35.679 --> 48:37.124
Well, that's, uh...

48:37.214 --> 48:38.693
Yeah.

48:39.183 --> 48:40.423
Careful what you wish for.

48:43.187 --> 48:44.188
David.

48:46.624 --> 48:47.967
I'm sorry to interrupt

48:48.959 --> 48:51.599
No. Don't be silly.
It's fine.

48:52.463 --> 48:55.706
Um, I'm having a drink.
Would you join me?

48:57.301 --> 48:58.302
Oh, sure.

48:59.303 --> 49:00.543
I'll be right back.

49:10.948 --> 49:12.655
Hello?
Hey, Anna?

49:12.750 --> 49:15.560
It's Craig, babe.
They just found him
out at the quarry.

49:15.619 --> 49:18.327
He's dead.
Someone shot him.

49:18.989 --> 49:20.059
What?

49:21.792 --> 49:23.169
Do they know who did it?

49:23.461 --> 49:25.498
I don't really have
all the details yet.

49:25.996 --> 49:27.304
Um, can you meet up later?

49:27.398 --> 49:28.468
Yeah, of course.

49:30.968 --> 49:33.128
Um, there's something else
I need to talk to you about.

49:33.404 --> 49:34.906
What is it?

49:37.107 --> 49:38.518
Oh, shit. Fuck.

49:38.609 --> 49:40.529
Babe, I got to go, all right.
I'll call you back.

49:41.645 --> 49:42.646
Hello?

50:02.666 --> 50:04.441
I just heard from Zeke.

50:05.302 --> 50:06.303
How are you doing?

50:07.371 --> 50:08.941
I just don't get it.

50:11.108 --> 50:12.610
Who'd want to hurt Craig?

50:13.677 --> 50:16.624
Yeah, I know. Can you
sit down for a second?

50:17.515 --> 50:18.516
Yeah.

50:20.284 --> 50:22.286
So, how does
this work again?

50:22.553 --> 50:24.396
Uh, first you make
a hole at the top,

50:24.822 --> 50:27.132
so you can reach in and
scoop all the guts out.

50:31.862 --> 50:33.068
Oh, man.

50:33.464 --> 50:35.034
Your parents' knives suck.

50:35.132 --> 50:36.133
Yeah.

50:39.637 --> 50:40.980
That's better.

50:41.805 --> 50:44.979
Do you carry that with you,
like, all the time?

50:45.709 --> 50:47.814
Oh, this thing? Sure.

50:49.847 --> 50:51.155
Why?

50:52.249 --> 50:53.660
I don't know.

50:54.218 --> 50:55.424
Just in case.

51:00.391 --> 51:02.997
I called the army base that
David said that he was from.

51:03.561 --> 51:06.940
They told me that
David Collins died a week ago.

51:07.765 --> 51:10.075
He was in some military
hospital in Arizona.

51:10.167 --> 51:13.341
There was a fire
from oxygen tanks.

51:14.038 --> 51:16.848
About 20 people died,
David Collins was one of them.

51:17.341 --> 51:19.514
Does David have any ID?
Credit cards?

51:21.011 --> 51:22.291
I've never seen
him use a wallet.

51:22.713 --> 51:25.694
What about his phone?
He has a burner, right?

51:26.250 --> 51:28.696
Why don't you check some
of the numbers he's called?

51:28.852 --> 51:30.092
Your brother
knows computers.

51:30.187 --> 51:32.030
Have him look
some of them up.

51:32.089 --> 51:33.466
Yeah. That's a good idea.

51:33.557 --> 51:36.697
Hey, Kristen. I think that couple's
been done for a bit.

51:36.760 --> 51:38.068
I've got it. Thanks.

51:38.862 --> 51:40.307
Call me after work, okay?

51:41.131 --> 51:42.906
Take care of yourself.
You, too.

51:50.207 --> 51:52.050
Do you want
some advice, Luke?

51:53.143 --> 51:54.144
Sure.

51:55.913 --> 51:57.790
Never let anyone
pick on you.

51:58.749 --> 52:01.252
Otherwise, you'll carry it with
you the rest of your life.

52:02.052 --> 52:03.895
Those kids at school,
they're bigger than you?

52:04.254 --> 52:05.255
Yeah.

52:05.556 --> 52:07.263
Then bring
a knife to school.

52:07.825 --> 52:09.505
If they take it off of you
and beat you up,

52:09.560 --> 52:10.920
you go around
their houses at night

52:10.961 --> 52:12.565
and burn them down
with their families inside.

52:12.630 --> 52:14.166
What's the worst
they can do?

52:17.401 --> 52:19.278
Yeah. Okay.

52:21.939 --> 52:24.249
Here. You keep it.

52:25.342 --> 52:27.117
You're giving this to me?

52:27.177 --> 52:29.157
Yeah, man, it's yours.
I've got others.

52:29.246 --> 52:30.247
Thanks.

52:32.282 --> 52:33.625
Hey.

52:34.652 --> 52:35.858
Mom and Dad around?

52:35.953 --> 52:37.091
No.
They went to the store.

52:37.154 --> 52:39.259
Your mom's making
pumpkin pie.

52:41.091 --> 52:42.331
That's cool.

53:00.778 --> 53:02.155
Shit.

53:03.781 --> 53:05.021
Fuck!

53:51.061 --> 53:52.062
Fuck.

53:53.097 --> 53:54.508
Oh, my God!

53:57.935 --> 53:58.936
Hello.

53:59.603 --> 54:01.605
Hey, it's, uh, me.

54:02.439 --> 54:03.440
Hey.

54:09.046 --> 54:10.047
What?

54:11.715 --> 54:15.686
They found the gun that
killed Craig in your van?

54:19.189 --> 54:21.135
Yeah, it was wiped clean.

54:21.225 --> 54:23.425
Um, I guess they just got an
anonymous tip or something.

54:23.761 --> 54:25.240
But you're innocent!

54:25.863 --> 54:29.276
Anna, I know, but' um,
then they searched my room,

54:29.366 --> 54:31.243
and they found some
other stuff. You know.

54:31.301 --> 54:33.872
So, it looks like
I'm actually gonna be
here for a little while.

54:37.241 --> 54:38.777
I love you, all right?

54:40.444 --> 54:42.720
Yeah, I know.
I gotta go.

54:44.214 --> 54:45.591
<i>Okay -</i>

54:45.916 --> 54:47.122
Love you, bye.

55:15.312 --> 55:17.952
Honey, you okay?

55:20.417 --> 55:21.418
I, um...

55:22.786 --> 55:24.527
My friend Craig
was killed today.

55:26.290 --> 55:28.600
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

55:28.659 --> 55:30.935
How? What happened?

55:32.296 --> 55:34.003
He was shot.
I don't know.

55:36.700 --> 55:38.373
And they arrested
Zeke for it.

55:38.502 --> 55:40.641
- Zeke?
- I'm sorry, honey.

55:40.938 --> 55:43.145
But if they arrested
your ex-boyfriend,

55:43.207 --> 55:44.948
it was probably for
a very good reason.

55:45.275 --> 55:47.715
We all know Zeke
was never exactly
a pillar of this community.

55:48.979 --> 55:52.324
He's not my ex-boyfriend,
Dad, he's my boyfriend.

55:52.616 --> 55:54.721
I never stopped seeing him.

55:54.852 --> 55:56.525
I'm 20 years old,
I can date who I want.

55:56.620 --> 55:57.963
As long as you live in
this house,
you cannot.

55:58.021 --> 56:00.023
Oh, you know
nothing about him!
Nothing!

56:00.157 --> 56:02.501
I know he's a drugged-out
punk junkie...
Really, Dad!

56:02.559 --> 56:03.560
...who started
dating my daughter

56:03.660 --> 56:05.640
when she was 17 years old,
is what I know.

56:06.964 --> 56:08.307
Right.

56:10.534 --> 56:12.036
What about him?

56:14.538 --> 56:16.484
Everybody's best friend.

56:17.808 --> 56:19.515
I called the military base
that he said he was from

56:19.576 --> 56:20.919
and they told me
he was dead.

56:25.716 --> 56:28.356
Ah, that's military
intelligence for you.

56:30.487 --> 56:33.058
Right. Ask to see his ID.

56:34.324 --> 56:37.669
He's not David Collins, okay.
We don't know who he is.

56:40.497 --> 56:43.910
I was part of a special forces
unit when I was injured,

56:44.034 --> 56:47.038
so they should be
providing a cover story

56:47.104 --> 56:48.708
if any civilians
ask about me.

56:48.772 --> 56:50.513
That's a good thing.

56:52.042 --> 56:54.386
But I did get
my dog tags back.

56:54.511 --> 56:55.785
Uh...

56:56.413 --> 56:57.721
They're right here.

57:01.351 --> 57:03.695
I don't like to
wear them because, uh...

57:03.887 --> 57:06.390
Well, I don't know,
but, um...

57:07.557 --> 57:09.366
I like having them
with me, though, you know.

57:10.527 --> 57:13.064
As for ID, I don't
have a current license,

57:13.196 --> 57:16.405
but, uh, I've got
my documents in my bag.
Should I go...

57:16.733 --> 57:19.213
No, no, no.
That won't be necessary.

57:21.538 --> 57:24.610
Anna Peterson,
you owe him an apology
right now.

57:24.708 --> 57:26.745
No fucking way.
You watch your mouth,
young lady.

57:27.377 --> 57:29.084
I am very sorry
about your friend Craig.

57:29.146 --> 57:30.648
That's a terrible thing
that happened.

57:31.481 --> 57:33.757
As far as it goes
with Zeke Hastings
and his crew,

57:33.817 --> 57:35.160
I have it on
very good authority

57:35.252 --> 57:36.788
they're nothing but
a bunch of pot dealers.

57:36.887 --> 57:38.924
You wanna know why Zeke
was arrested for murder?

57:38.989 --> 57:40.991
Because he probably
did it, that's why.

57:43.060 --> 57:44.437
- Fuck you!
- Ugh.

57:44.728 --> 57:46.730
Hey, now, Anna.

57:48.765 --> 57:51.405
I'm sorry, honey.
David, I'm terribly sorry.

57:51.601 --> 57:55.139
No, that's okay.
She's, uh... She's upset.

57:58.909 --> 58:00.411
I probably should
have explained

58:00.477 --> 58:03.981
the, uh, special forces
thing earlier,

58:04.081 --> 58:08.928
it's just, we're not really
supposed to talk about it.

58:09.252 --> 58:11.129
No. I understand.

58:12.255 --> 58:13.666
Uh...

58:13.757 --> 58:16.135
I could use a drink.
How about you, David?

58:17.461 --> 58:18.769
Yes, please.

58:39.116 --> 58:40.117
What?

58:46.823 --> 58:47.824
Hey.

59:02.039 --> 59:03.848
I just wanted
to <i>say,</i> uh...

59:11.314 --> 59:14.352
I just wanted
to say how sorry
I am about Craig.

59:15.419 --> 59:17.399
He seemed like
a really cool guy.

59:18.855 --> 59:23.065
And Zeke getting arrested...
Again, I'm very sorry.

59:23.860 --> 59:26.363
I know you don't need me here
at this stressful time.

59:28.331 --> 59:31.005
I'm not helping,
which is a shame,

59:32.235 --> 59:33.714
because I promised
Caleb I would do

59:33.770 --> 59:35.841
anything I could
to help your family.

59:37.174 --> 59:38.175
But just so you know,

59:38.241 --> 59:39.584
I'll be moving on
in a couple of days.

59:39.676 --> 59:42.213
So, you don't need to put up
with me much longer, okay?

59:53.690 --> 59:54.964
Okay.

59:58.862 --> 01:00:00.034
<i>Okay-</i>

01:00:02.199 --> 01:00:03.644
Good.

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:11.384
What is this?

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:12.748
Is this the CD
you made me?

01:00:14.878 --> 01:00:15.879
Um, yeah.

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:18.089
Is it done?

01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:22.219
Yeah.

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:24.390
Well, thank you.

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:27.301
I can't wait
to listen to it.

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:44.059
I want every contractor
within a 100-mile radius.

01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:45.279
And I don't care
where they come from.

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:47.083
KPG, ex-military, whatever.

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:49.817
I'll need a team mobilized by the
time l land.

01:00:49.913 --> 01:00:51.824
I'll give them the necessary
mission specs in person.

01:00:51.915 --> 01:00:53.656
We can't risk
a leak on this.

01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:56.458
Good luck.

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:08.534
You took a picture
of Davids phone?

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:10.873
Yeah. I paid for a reverse
directory thing

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:12.503
to look the number up online.

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:15.776
It said it was this unlisted
landline of a doctor in Miami.

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:17.284
His name's Peter Boddington.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.944
Except he's not
a doctor anymore.

01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:21.014
He lost his license
two years ago

01:01:21.111 --> 01:01:23.471
after performing
a face lift on a woman
while he was drunk.

01:01:23.547 --> 01:01:26.494
So, David knows the guy?
I mean, maybe it's
his uncle or something.

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:28.391
That's what
I'm trying to figure out.

01:01:28.485 --> 01:01:30.055
I need to talk to the police.

01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:32.030
The cops found those
drugs in Zeke's room,

01:01:32.122 --> 01:01:33.965
so they think
they've got their guy.

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:35.503
So, what do you
need me to do?

01:01:35.659 --> 01:01:38.538
Get any information
you can on this guy.

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:42.806
Do you really think
David killed Craig
and that other guy?

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:44.978
Yeah. I do.

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:48.980
Okay. I'll see if
I can find anything.

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:51.212
Thank you, Luke.

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:22.279
I'm sorry. I'll show you some
magic tricks later. Just...

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:23.673
Um...

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:47.697
- Hey, faggot.
- Oh. Whoa.

01:02:50.634 --> 01:02:52.375
Hey, what's that
you're looking at?

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:55.244
Oh...

01:02:55.372 --> 01:02:57.909
Are you looking for
someone to do your
sex change operation?

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:06.151
You little fucking bitch...

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:11.896
That's right, bitches.

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.243
God damn it.

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:34.618
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

01:03:34.678 --> 01:03:36.658
Mrs. Peterson?
Yes, that's right.

01:03:36.746 --> 01:03:38.919
Mr. Alston will see you now.
Please, step inside.

01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:40.655
Okay.
Just a second.

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:45.091
What happened?

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:49.096
This kid called me
a faggot,

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:53.935
so l, uh,

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:55.977
broke a yardstick
on his face.

01:03:58.635 --> 01:03:59.636
<i>Okay -</i>

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:01.604
Awesome.

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:08.283
I'll go in with you.

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:09.979
<i>Okay -</i>

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:13.216
Is it this way?
Yes.

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:17.359
Due to our school's
zero tolerance
policy on violence,

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:20.128
I'm afraid we have no choice
but to expel your son.

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:22.667
That's pending
the decision of the board,

01:04:22.726 --> 01:04:24.535
but I'm afraid
it's fairly certain.

01:04:25.128 --> 01:04:26.505
But...
I'm sorry.

01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:29.343
What did the kid call him?

01:04:31.735 --> 01:04:32.736
What?

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:35.390
You know, the kid,
the one Luke
hit in the face.

01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:37.008
What did he call Luke?

01:04:37.574 --> 01:04:39.485
I don't think that's relevant
to this conversation.

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:41.317
Did he call him a faggot?

01:04:43.813 --> 01:04:46.760
I believe that's the word that was
used, yes.
But that's no excuse...

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:48.761
So, that makes it
a hate crime.

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:52.658
What?
A hate crime.

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:55.230
And I'd like to know
how many others

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:58.238
have been perpetrated
against her son
under your watch.

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:02.909
A gay student targeted
with physical violence
finally defends himself,

01:05:02.999 --> 01:05:04.672
and you're... What?

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:06.205
Suspending him?

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:09.607
We could
consider suspension.

01:05:09.706 --> 01:05:11.185
No. You couldn't.

01:05:12.342 --> 01:05:14.344
I'll be interested to see
what the board makes of you

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:17.688
when this is in front of the entire
country, not to mention our lawyers.

01:05:19.182 --> 01:05:20.923
Do you want to sue them?

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:22.221
I... I don't, uh...

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:24.026
We're suing you
and the school board.

01:05:30.894 --> 01:05:32.567
I didn't even know
he was gay.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:37.407
What about
after-school detention?

01:05:42.372 --> 01:05:43.544
For how long?

01:05:44.407 --> 01:05:45.442
A month.

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:49.484
That seems fair.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:51.785
After-school detention.

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:54.157
We'll put him to work
helping the prom committee

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:55.729
set up for
the Halloween dance.

01:05:56.719 --> 01:05:58.130
We'll agree to that

01:05:59.923 --> 01:06:01.903
But I do not want
to hear anything further

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:03.729
about this young man
being harassed.

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:05.067
We understand each other?

01:06:05.929 --> 01:06:07.670
I believe we do, Mr...

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:11.143
Who are you?

01:06:11.234 --> 01:06:12.577
I'm a friend of the family.

01:06:25.582 --> 01:06:27.186
After-school detention
for a month.

01:06:27.951 --> 01:06:28.986
That's it?
Yeah.

01:06:31.855 --> 01:06:34.028
See you later.
Oh, David?

01:06:35.959 --> 01:06:37.159
Can I talk to you
for a second?

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:41.371
I'm going to step out into the hall
with Luke for a moment, if that's okay.

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:42.534
Oh, certainly.

01:06:45.602 --> 01:06:47.673
So, she thinks
you killed Craig.

01:06:47.804 --> 01:06:49.306
And she's trying to make
a case to the police

01:06:49.439 --> 01:06:51.646
so they'll let
her boyfriend go.

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:54.219
Anna told you all this?
Yeah.

01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:57.148
Do you think
I killed Craig?

01:06:57.647 --> 01:06:59.126
I don't care.

01:06:59.649 --> 01:07:01.356
But that's why

01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:03.522
she wanted me to
check out that plastic
surgeon in Florida.

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.361
She wanted to know what
the connection was there.

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:09.301
Yeah, I mean,
why would I need
a plastic surgeon, right'?

01:07:09.392 --> 01:07:10.700
To change your appearance.

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:13.004
Like, the bones
in your face.

01:07:13.396 --> 01:07:16.172
And maybe scar up your fingers
so you don't have prints.

01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:19.040
I mean, at least
that's what I figured.

01:07:19.903 --> 01:07:21.576
I know you're not
really David Collins,

01:07:21.671 --> 01:07:24.015
I looked him up right
after Anna said that.

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:27.349
So, maybe you don't want
people 10 know
who you are.

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:28.818
A doctor who would
do that sort of thing

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:29.913
is probably pretty rare.

01:07:30.013 --> 01:07:31.653
I mean, there's probably
rules against it.

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:34.854
But that doctor, well,
I guess he needs the money,

01:07:34.918 --> 01:07:36.488
so he'd do
that kind of work.

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:42.333
That's an interesting theory.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.867
I'm not going to
tell anyone about it.

01:07:45.929 --> 01:07:47.408
And nobody
will believe Anna.

01:07:47.497 --> 01:07:49.204
She doesn't have
anything against you.

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:53.681
You killed Dad's boss,
too, right?

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:57.181
I don't care. I'm not
going say anything.

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:58.946
Why not?

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:02.717
Because we're friends.

01:08:04.614 --> 01:08:05.615
Right?

01:08:08.685 --> 01:08:11.894
Yeah. Of course we are.

01:08:14.057 --> 01:08:15.297
<i>Okay -</i>

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:17.394
I just wanted you to know.

01:08:22.298 --> 01:08:24.573
Did Anna tell anyone
else about this?

01:08:26.069 --> 01:08:27.479
I don't know.

01:08:27.904 --> 01:08:29.281
Her friend, Kristen, maybe'?

01:08:30.907 --> 01:08:31.908
<i>Okay-</i>

01:08:33.576 --> 01:08:34.747
Thank you.

01:08:49.559 --> 01:08:51.560
You know, David,
I really...

01:08:53.062 --> 01:08:54.439
I wanna thank you.

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:57.171
I don't know what
I would have done
if you hadn't been here.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:09:00.142
And I don't... I don't
mean just for today,

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:03.240
I mean everything.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:06.149
I am... I'm really grateful.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.626
Really, Mrs. Peterson.
It's no problem.

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:16.594
I'll go get the rest.

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:20.294
Thank you, David.

01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:04.835
Excuse me, ma'am.
Are you Anna Peterson?

01:10:05.068 --> 01:10:09.642
Uh, no. No,
she's working at the diner.

01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:11.376
I'm her mother.

01:10:11.474 --> 01:10:13.545
What's she...
Did she do something?

01:10:13.643 --> 01:10:14.849
No, it's fine, ma'am.

01:10:14.911 --> 01:10:16.754
But your daughter, she put in
a call to Fort Kennilworth

01:10:16.846 --> 01:10:19.383
a couple of days ago
asking about a man
named David Collins.

01:10:19.482 --> 01:10:21.325
Yes. Oh, that's right,
she did.

01:10:24.087 --> 01:10:25.395
You wouldn't
happen to have seen anyone

01:10:25.488 --> 01:10:26.694
resembling this man,
would you?

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:31.833
This is, um... David.

01:10:35.998 --> 01:10:37.944
Ma'am, when was
the last time you saw him.

01:10:39.168 --> 01:10:42.206
Well, he just went inside.

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:33.723
No!

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.633
Stop the girl! Get back here.

01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:00.917
Get him!

01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:29.946
Oh, shit!

01:13:17.827 --> 01:13:20.171
No, no, no, no.
Ah! David, what...

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:22.736
What is happening, David?

01:13:22.832 --> 01:13:24.243
Who are those men?

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:26.540
I really am sorry
about this, Mrs. Peterson.

01:13:26.602 --> 01:13:28.843
I'm afraid I haven't been
fully honest with you.

01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:30.542
What do you mean?

01:13:32.108 --> 01:13:35.112
It would take too long
to explain.

01:13:38.381 --> 01:13:39.553
I wanted to help.

01:13:39.682 --> 01:13:42.162
I considered it my mission
to assist you all
while I was here.

01:13:44.453 --> 01:13:47.195
There were just
too many complications.

01:13:48.024 --> 01:13:49.264
What are you talking about?

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:52.134
David, why are those men
trying to kill you?

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:53.802
It doesn't matter.

01:13:59.869 --> 01:14:01.143
Did you...

01:14:02.471 --> 01:14:06.942
Did you even
know my son?

01:14:09.078 --> 01:14:10.284
I did.

01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:12.285
Yes.

01:14:13.316 --> 01:14:15.091
We were in
the same program.

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:20.397
And he would understand
what I have to do here.

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:26.497
He's here in the...

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:37.583
I'm sorry.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:44.822
I'm going in.

01:14:45.081 --> 01:14:47.254
Give me 15 seconds
of cover, then hold.

01:15:18.981 --> 01:15:20.358
Fuck!

01:15:43.406 --> 01:15:44.908
Fuck.

01:15:58.721 --> 01:15:59.995
What the...

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:03.328
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:38.928
David.

01:16:40.463 --> 01:16:42.602
I'm really sorry
about this, sir.

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:32.490
I think he's dead.

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:34.852
Military police.
I'm gonna need
your vehicle.

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:35.985
What?

01:17:36.085 --> 01:17:37.792
Are the keys in it?
Yes, but...

01:17:58.541 --> 01:18:01.454
Excuse me,
are you Anna Peterson?

01:18:02.278 --> 01:18:03.313
Yes.

01:18:03.812 --> 01:18:05.120
My name is Major Carver.

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:07.221
Military police. I need you
to come with me, please.

01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:09.224
Okay. What's going on?

01:18:09.318 --> 01:18:10.854
It's about David,
Miss Peterson.

01:18:10.953 --> 01:18:12.113
He is not who
you think he is.

01:18:12.121 --> 01:18:13.623
And we need to go now.

01:18:15.457 --> 01:18:16.458
<i>Okay -</i>

01:18:18.227 --> 01:18:19.638
ls everything all right?

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:21.702
I think so.
I'll call you later, okay?

01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:22.797
Miss Peterson.

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:16.790
Hey-
Hey.

01:19:17.186 --> 01:19:18.392
Is Anna working?

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:20.730
Um, she just left.

01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:22.260
Oh, yeah?

01:19:22.691 --> 01:19:23.931
Where was she going?

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:26.237
I'm not sure exactly.

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:27.930
To pick up Luke?

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:29.903
Um...

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:31.544
I think that
she's going...

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.601
Never mind.

01:20:09.405 --> 01:20:10.611
What?

01:20:12.074 --> 01:20:13.985
Okay. Copy.
We're on our way.

01:20:15.611 --> 01:20:16.749
What?

01:20:16.912 --> 01:20:19.324
We're going to
the rec center
to get your brother.

01:20:19.415 --> 01:20:20.689
The police couldn't
send a car there.

01:20:20.783 --> 01:20:21.955
They've got
their hands full.

01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:25.261
Okay. You need to
tell me what's going on.

01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:27.032
Who are you?

01:20:27.589 --> 01:20:28.863
What? You came here
for David?

01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:30.163
Yes.

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:34.303
The soldier
you know as David

01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:36.365
was one of the subjects
of a medical experiment.

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:40.277
While we had him under study,
he killed several people
and escaped.

01:20:40.369 --> 01:20:42.315
Then he burned their bodies
to confuse us.

01:20:42.371 --> 01:20:44.051
We thought he'd died
in the fire initially.

01:20:44.106 --> 01:20:45.517
By the time we figured out
what he'd done,

01:20:45.607 --> 01:20:46.608
the trail was cold.

01:20:46.775 --> 01:20:47.845
Maybe you shouldn't
have tested

01:20:47.943 --> 01:20:49.354
your procedures
on a psychopath.

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:51.780
By all accounts,
he was an ideal soldier.

01:20:54.616 --> 01:20:55.617
I don't know.

01:20:56.719 --> 01:20:58.357
I need to call my brother.

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:05.869
Mr. Peterson,
is that a cell phone?

01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:08.468
Didn't I say,
"Phones off“?

01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:11.302
Hand it over.

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:13.874
You can have it back
after detention.

01:21:17.239 --> 01:21:19.651
Luke, I need you
to call me
when you get this.

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:21.188
Okay? It's important.

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.061
Where are those
cop cars going?

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:36.067
Somebody attacked your diner
right after we left it.

01:21:36.825 --> 01:21:38.600
It was called in
as an explosion.

01:21:41.029 --> 01:21:42.770
Is anyone alive?

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:44.237
I don't know.

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:47.604
It's possible that
he'd leave some wounded
to keep them busy.

01:21:49.204 --> 01:21:50.911
Wait. Where are my parents?

01:21:51.607 --> 01:21:53.712
You haven't said
anything about my parents.

01:21:57.679 --> 01:21:59.124
They're both dead.

01:22:00.182 --> 01:22:02.059
He killed them
before we could stop him.

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:04.697
I'm sorry.

01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:07.958
<i>No.</i>

01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:11.935
David has neurological
conditioning, Miss Peterson,

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:14.631
designed to protect both him
and the experiment.

01:22:16.298 --> 01:22:18.869
If he feels like his identity
may be compromised,

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:23.716
he's programmed to
clean up all loose ends.

01:22:24.406 --> 01:22:27.615
I doubt he could
stop himself now
even if he wanted to.

01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:31.991
It's why we need to
get you and your brother
somewhere safe.

01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:57.079
Miss Peterson,
we need to go.

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:01.743
Miss Peterson?

01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:04.085
Uh...

01:23:05.747 --> 01:23:07.624
Yeah, let's go
get my brother.

01:23:32.641 --> 01:23:33.949
What the hell is this?

01:23:35.277 --> 01:23:37.814
For the fall dance, they do
this Halloween maze thing.

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.350
Stay close to me.

01:24:03.472 --> 01:24:06.043
God damn it! What in the hell?

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:07.677
Who's in here?

01:24:09.144 --> 01:24:10.714
Military police!

01:24:10.812 --> 01:24:11.892
I'm here for Luke Peterson.

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:13.482
How do I get
through this maze?

01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:17.997
Left, right,
right, left, left,

01:24:18.153 --> 01:24:20.531
right, left,
then straight.

01:24:20.689 --> 01:24:21.690
Got it?

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:22.891
Yeah.

01:24:47.049 --> 01:24:48.050
Luke!
Uh, excuse me.

01:24:48.116 --> 01:24:50.027
But you're interrupting
detention right now.

01:24:51.353 --> 01:24:52.923
Who are you exactly?

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:56.959
What's going on?

01:24:57.059 --> 01:24:58.697
We need to go.
Your sister...

01:24:59.628 --> 01:25:00.629
Oh, shit.

01:25:11.373 --> 01:25:12.493
Who else is in here?

01:25:12.541 --> 01:25:13.611
No one. It's just us two.

01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:14.881
Where are the lights
controlled from?

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:16.251
There's a DJ booth
in the back.

01:25:17.546 --> 01:25:19.924
We need to get
out of here. Now.
Where's the back exit?

01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:21.823
It's this way.
Uh, follow me.

01:25:23.919 --> 01:25:25.227
Come on.
Uh...

01:25:38.467 --> 01:25:39.775
Just this way.

01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:41.579
Slow down.

01:25:56.952 --> 01:25:59.432
Run! Go out
the other way! Go!

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:40.634
Hello, sir.

01:27:22.170 --> 01:27:24.116
You shouldn't
have followed me.

01:27:25.173 --> 01:27:27.175
I don't know
what you expected.

01:27:33.582 --> 01:27:34.686
Shit.

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:37.594
Anna, I don't know
what's going on,
but David wouldn't hurt us.

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:40.229
Luke, I need you to trust me.

01:27:43.859 --> 01:27:45.770
Just come on.
What?

01:27:56.938 --> 01:27:57.939
Shit.

01:27:59.374 --> 01:28:00.375
Come on.

01:28:14.756 --> 01:28:15.826
I need you
to hide in here. Okay?

01:28:15.991 --> 01:28:17.299
What? No way.

01:28:17.425 --> 01:28:19.769
Anna, look, David
was probably
just after that army guy.

01:28:19.828 --> 01:28:20.932
Let's just...

01:28:21.096 --> 01:28:22.268
Let's go talk to him.

01:28:22.731 --> 01:28:23.732
Luke.

01:28:25.834 --> 01:28:27.677
He killed Mom and Dad.

01:28:29.671 --> 01:28:32.083
No, he didn't.
You're just saying that.

01:28:35.811 --> 01:28:37.119
What?

01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:41.754
Mom and Dad are...

01:28:42.617 --> 01:28:44.187
Please, Luke.

01:28:44.419 --> 01:28:46.365
Okay, you need
to hide in there.

01:28:47.122 --> 01:28:48.692
I'm going
to lead him away.

01:28:48.857 --> 01:28:51.997
You can't come out unless
you hear me or the police.

01:28:57.766 --> 01:28:59.336
I'm going to
come back for you.

01:29:12.147 --> 01:29:14.286
I'm really sorry
about this, guys.

01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:18.362
I tried to think of
another way to do it.

01:29:23.825 --> 01:29:25.736
Any other solution.

01:29:36.504 --> 01:29:37.505
Luke!

01:29:40.809 --> 01:29:42.584
Come on out, buddy.

01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:50.325
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:27.284
You killed my parents.

01:31:28.917 --> 01:31:30.089
I did.

01:31:31.586 --> 01:31:32.587
Yes.

01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:12.466
<i>Ow!</i>

01:32:30.245 --> 01:32:33.715
Stop it.
It'll be over in a second.

01:32:52.767 --> 01:32:53.939
Hey, Luke.

01:33:23.932 --> 01:33:25.377
You did the right thing.

01:33:29.637 --> 01:33:31.207
I don't blame you.

01:33:37.212 --> 01:33:38.987
Don't feel bad.

01:33:55.396 --> 01:33:56.636
Thank you.

01:33:57.065 --> 01:33:58.271
You okay?

01:33:58.333 --> 01:33:59.505
Yeah. Are you?

01:34:00.335 --> 01:34:01.643
Yeah.

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:32.978
Follow the light.

01:34:36.037 --> 01:34:37.675
You both feeling okay?

01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:42.110
We're fine.

01:34:42.544 --> 01:34:44.217
Great. I'll be right back.

01:34:56.191 --> 01:34:57.192
Copy that.

01:34:58.459 --> 01:34:59.870
What's the deal?

01:34:59.961 --> 01:35:01.338
Guess there's
two bodies inside,

01:35:01.396 --> 01:35:02.875
both of them
pretty badly burned.

01:35:02.964 --> 01:35:04.966
One of the guys said
their teeth are missing,

01:35:05.033 --> 01:35:07.138
got knocked out,
so I don't know
what the deal is.

01:35:07.302 --> 01:35:08.838
As soon <i>as</i>
we get the all clear,
you can go in.

01:35:08.903 --> 01:35:09.904
<i>Okay -</i>

01:35:40.535 --> 01:35:41.912
What the fuck!
