00:42.973 --> 00:46.223
Zounds! I did thee mightily smitely.

00:48.437 --> 00:51.723
"Zounds" is a Renaissance English word,
short for "God's wounds"...

00:51.940 --> 00:54.182
...but "smitely," that's pure Flanders.

00:55.235 --> 00:56.694
Please call a doctor.

00:57.571 --> 01:03.740
- These Renaissance fairs are so boring.
- Oh, really? Did you see the loom?

01:04.536 --> 01:06.280
I took loom in high school.

01:19.134 --> 01:21.804
Yon meat 'tis sweet
as summer's wafting breeze.

01:22.120 --> 01:24.586
- Can I have some?
- Mine ears are open to the pleas...

01:24.765 --> 01:26.674
...of those who speak ye old English.

01:26.850 --> 01:30.385
Sweet maiden of the spit, grant now
my boon, that I might sup...

01:30.604 --> 01:33.309
...upon suckling pig this noon.
- Whatever.

01:34.608 --> 01:37.562
I've eaten eight different meats.
I'm a true Renaissance man.

01:39.488 --> 01:43.817
I'll go to the first-aid tent and tell them
to plug in ye old stomach pump.

01:47.496 --> 01:49.904
Alight your gaze
on yonder fabled beasts of yore.

01:54.628 --> 01:56.537
Behold the rarest of the rare...

01:56.714 --> 02:01.257
...the mythological two-headed hound,
born with only one head.

02:01.468 --> 02:05.762
And here, out of the mists of history,
the legendary esquilax:

02:05.931 --> 02:11.920
A horse with the head of a rabbit
and the body of a rabbit.

02:12.813 --> 02:14.930
It's galloping away.

02:14.273 --> 02:16.640
Here, bunny-bunny. Here, bunny.

02:16.233 --> 02:17.514
Here, "esquilax."

02:30.289 --> 02:32.696
I've been waiting for you, Lisa.

02:33.167 --> 02:35.740
- How did you know my name?
- Your nametag.

02:38.172 --> 02:40.248
Would you like to know your future?

02:40.716 --> 02:43.587
Sorry, I don't believe in fortunetelling.
I should go.

02:43.802 --> 02:46.637
What's your hurry? Bart, Maggie
and Marge are at the joust.

02:46.805 --> 02:49.213
And Homer is heckling
the puppet show.

02:49.433 --> 02:52.434
Wow, you can see into the present.

02:52.645 --> 02:55.645
Now we'll see what the future holds.

02:57.608 --> 02:59.684
- The death card?
- No, that's good.

02:59.860 --> 03:02.980
It means transition, change.

03:04.406 --> 03:05.687
That's cute.

03:05.866 --> 03:07.111
The happy squirrel.

03:07.326 --> 03:08.785
- That's bad?
- Possibly.

03:08.952 --> 03:11.360
The cards are vague and mysterious.

03:11.538 --> 03:15.157
They seem to be revealing
the story of your first love.

03:15.334 --> 03:16.876
Do you want me to continue?

03:18.128 --> 03:20.168
- Guess so.
- It's...

03:20.339 --> 03:22.912
It's coming to me. Yes.

03:23.920 --> 03:27.410
I see an eastern university
in the year 2010.

03:27.221 --> 03:30.969
The world has become
a very different place.

03:42.403 --> 03:44.609
I can't wait to see that play.

03:56.830 --> 03:58.206
- Hey, watch it.
- Watch it.

03:59.545 --> 04:03.210
That man is instantly the most
annoying person I've ever met.

04:03.590 --> 04:05.998
A soy-based snack
will calm me down.

04:17.896 --> 04:19.805
Him again.

04:27.406 --> 04:30.609
Hello. I need Ecosystem of the Marsh
by Thompson.

04:30.784 --> 04:34.153
The last copy was just signed out by...

04:34.330 --> 04:35.954
...Hugh Parkfield.

04:36.165 --> 04:37.707
Oh, there he is.

04:37.875 --> 04:39.832
No. It couldn't be.

04:42.212 --> 04:44.703
Thanks for holding my book
while I tied my shoe.

04:45.424 --> 04:48.591
That's the book I need.
You'll probably take forever with it too.

04:48.802 --> 04:51.258
- I read faster.
- I read at a 78th-grade level.

04:51.472 --> 04:53.132
Right here.

04:57.610 --> 05:00.150
- Finished this page?
- Ages ago.

05:00.606 --> 05:02.100
- I'll get the dictionary.
- Why?

05:02.274 --> 05:05.192
- You'll see. "Stochastic."
- Pertaining to a process...

05:05.361 --> 05:09.260
...involving a randomly determined
sequence of observations.

05:13.410 --> 05:16.660
First, they hate each other.
All of a sudden, they love each other.

05:16.830 --> 05:20.614
- Oh, it doesn't make any sense to me.
- Of course not. You're a robot.

05:30.886 --> 05:33.887
I never met anyone who so understood
the magic of Jim Carrey.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.639
He can make you laugh with no more
than a frantic flailing of his limbs.

05:39.190 --> 05:40.928
I can't believe how much
we have in common.

05:41.146 --> 05:44.811
We're studying the environment, we're
utterly humorless about vegetarianism.

05:44.984 --> 05:46.442
And we both love the Rolling Stones.

05:48.612 --> 05:50.439
Yes. Not for their music
but for their tireless efforts...

05:50.614 --> 05:52.406
...to preserve historic buildings.

05:52.574 --> 05:54.650
Lisa, I can't bear being apart
all summer.

05:54.827 --> 05:56.404
Come with me to Parkfield Manor.

05:56.578 --> 06:00.113
I'd love to. Can we get vegetarian meals
at your parents' house?

06:00.332 --> 06:02.760
- Yes, we can, Lisa.
- That is good.

06:02.251 --> 06:05.860
- Because eating animals is wrong.
- So very wrong.

06:05.254 --> 06:09.501
- When will the world learn?
- I don't know. I just don't know.

06:11.510 --> 06:13.301
I love these new planes.

06:13.470 --> 06:16.839
Yes. It's a good thing they re-evaluated
those wacky old designs.

06:29.278 --> 06:31.816
- Beautiful dinnerware, Mrs. Parkfield.
- Thank you.

06:31.989 --> 06:34.361
They were made
for the finest family in Britain.

06:34.575 --> 06:37.196
I don't know
how we ended up with them.

06:38.245 --> 06:41.412
Should I laugh? Was that dry
British wit or subtle self-pity?

06:41.582 --> 06:43.409
They're staring at me. Better respond.

06:46.128 --> 06:49.711
It's good to hear
a boisterous American laugh.

06:49.923 --> 06:53.707
And I love that painting. Judging
by the clothes, I'd say 17th century.

06:53.927 --> 06:56.418
Actually, Lisa, it's just Uncle Eldred.

06:56.597 --> 07:00.844
I get me brain medicines
from the National Health.

07:02.436 --> 07:06.303
This place is so enchanting, Hugh.
I love it here.

07:06.523 --> 07:08.646
I wanted this to be perfect for you.

07:08.817 --> 07:11.391
I know you Americans
like everything to be...

07:11.570 --> 07:13.314
...fireworks.

07:24.249 --> 07:27.850
Oh, blast. Go to plan B.

07:30.839 --> 07:32.915
Yes, I will.

07:36.110 --> 07:37.719
Isn't it wonderful?

07:37.930 --> 07:42.924
Master Hugh has found a true love.

07:53.445 --> 07:56.280
- Hi, Mom.
- Lisa. Hello.

07:56.448 --> 07:59.698
How are you doing in England?
Remember, an elevator is a "lift"...

07:59.868 --> 08:03.700
...a mile is called a "kilometer,"
and botulism is "steak-and-kidney pie."

08:03.914 --> 08:05.954
Guess what.
Hugh and I are getting married.

08:06.166 --> 08:10.413
All right! Lisa, that's wonderful.

08:10.587 --> 08:14.253
If only your father was still with us.

08:14.425 --> 08:16.750
But he left for work a few minutes ago.

08:16.969 --> 08:21.346
Remember we'd always plan my dream
wedding, and you always promised...

08:21.515 --> 08:25.679
...to, you know, well,
keep Dad from ruining it?

08:25.894 --> 08:29.726
Oh, don 't worry, honey.
I guarantee your father will behave.

08:29.940 --> 08:32.477
- Mom, it's a Picturephone.
- Oh, this? This?

08:32.650 --> 08:35.230
Oh, no. I just got
a touch of the rheumatiz.

08:36.739 --> 08:37.818
Mom, Picturephone.

08:40.340 --> 08:42.441
Hi, Mom.
Oh, that's great news about Lisa.

08:42.620 --> 08:44.529
Well, listen, I better get back to work.

08:46.457 --> 08:49.126
They're finally paying me for this.

08:52.629 --> 08:54.337
Oh, yeah.

09:02.973 --> 09:05.844
Yes, but the international market
is my focus.

09:07.102 --> 09:09.427
Oh, Marge, that's great news.

09:09.646 --> 09:12.102
Hey, hey, there
with the personal calls, Simpson.

09:12.775 --> 09:15.978
But, Mr. Milhouse,
my little girl's getting married.

09:16.195 --> 09:17.570
Lisa?

09:18.614 --> 09:20.523
My one true love.

09:21.909 --> 09:25.360
It's not you, Milhouse.
I just don't plan to ever get married.

09:30.334 --> 09:35.430
I think I'll write your performance
evaluation now, Simpson.

09:40.344 --> 09:42.835
I gotta call everyone
and tell them the good news.

09:43.347 --> 09:44.426
What the...?

09:44.598 --> 09:47.600
Maggie, I need to use the phone.

09:48.811 --> 09:50.720
Will that girl ever shut up?

09:50.938 --> 09:54.580
I'll plan everything.
We can have the reception at Moe's.

09:54.233 --> 09:57.602
Why not have the whole wedding there.
We'll do it on a Monday morning.

09:57.778 --> 10:00.649
- There'll be fewer drunks.
- Don't take this personally.

10:00.823 --> 10:04.156
I've obtained a court order to prevent
you from planning this wedding.

10:04.326 --> 10:05.655
"Whereas Homer Simpson..."

10:05.828 --> 10:08.663
Well, these seem to be in order.
I'll be in the hammock.

10:11.583 --> 10:13.956
"Mr. Smithers plus guest."

10:14.795 --> 10:16.752
There's only one person
I'd wanna bring.

10:20.217 --> 10:24.345
Oh, Mr. Burns, we'll thaw you out
the second they discover the cure...

10:24.513 --> 10:27.265
...for 17 stab wounds in the back.
How we doing, boys?

10:27.474 --> 10:29.348
Well, we're up to 15.

10:39.778 --> 10:43.942
If you have three Pepsis and drink one,
how much more refreshed are you?

10:44.116 --> 10:46.239
The redhead in
the Chicago school system.

10:46.410 --> 10:48.367
- Pepsi?
- Partial credit.

10:50.331 --> 10:54.198
We're invited to the wedding of our
only graduate to read at an adult level.

10:54.376 --> 10:55.835
It must be Lisa Simpson.

10:56.450 --> 10:59.627
Of course, Martin Prince perished
in that science-fair explosion.

11:00.507 --> 11:03.259
Not quite perished, my lady love.

11:03.427 --> 11:06.262
Although some days I wish I had.

11:20.402 --> 11:22.976
Hey, I remember you.
Mayor Quimby, right?

11:24.156 --> 11:27.740
No. Look at this license.
I'm Mohamed Jafar.

11:27.242 --> 11:30.861
Quimby, after this fare, get your
indicted ass to the convention center.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.286
I cut the ribbon
at that convention center.

11:37.440 --> 11:40.543
Just a couple more blocks
to my house.

11:42.925 --> 11:46.900
Darling, don't worry. I'm sure
I'll get along with your family.

11:46.178 --> 11:47.672
You prepared me for the worst.

11:47.846 --> 11:50.500
As long as they're not
squatting in a ditch...

11:50.182 --> 11:52.222
...poking berries up their noses.

11:52.393 --> 11:54.350
And if they are?

11:55.479 --> 11:57.555
Here they come. Raise the flag.

12:01.276 --> 12:03.768
- Oh, Lisa.
- Yo, Hugh.

12:03.988 --> 12:06.360
Here's a little bit of U.S. Hospitality.

12:06.532 --> 12:08.441
What do you think of that?

12:10.786 --> 12:12.328
Dad!

12:14.498 --> 12:15.873
Now throw compost on it.

12:20.254 --> 12:21.997
Enjoy.

12:22.923 --> 12:24.832
Still warm.

12:32.307 --> 12:35.474
You can be the first to try out
the new guest bedroom I built.

12:35.644 --> 12:39.856
If the building inspector comes by,
it's not a room, it's a window box.

12:41.483 --> 12:42.812
Oh, Hugh, thank you.

12:42.985 --> 12:45.690
You've been just wonderful
through this entire ordeal.

12:45.904 --> 12:49.238
Lisa, I love you so much.
I'm willing to go through anything.

12:51.410 --> 12:54.861
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, Lisa.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.488
Fortunately, the compost heap
broke my fall.

12:57.666 --> 12:59.374
Be a dear, run a bath.

13:03.255 --> 13:06.420
Homer, Bart, Maggie,
company eating rules.

13:06.842 --> 13:08.170
Oh, right.

13:10.262 --> 13:14.212
Anyway, Hugh, there's more to my life
than just the wrecking ball.

13:14.391 --> 13:16.514
I also crush cars into cubes.

13:16.685 --> 13:19.930
On the side,
I promote local tough-man contests.

13:19.271 --> 13:22.272
I'm getting out all my aggression
till I go to law school.

13:22.483 --> 13:25.353
So, Hugh, have you heard
all the latest American jokes?

13:25.527 --> 13:27.900
Here's a good one. Pull my finger.

13:28.447 --> 13:30.653
Yes, we have that one in England too.

13:30.866 --> 13:32.526
I said, pull my finger.

13:32.743 --> 13:35.412
Mom, we've got my wedding-dress
fitting this afternoon.

13:35.579 --> 13:38.414
Maggie, if you're not doing anything,
why don't you come.

13:38.624 --> 13:40.663
Maggie, don't talk
with your mouth full.

13:41.251 --> 13:43.410
Me and Bart will take Hugh
out this afternoon.

13:43.629 --> 13:45.835
Hugh should take it easy
because of his fall.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.793
The only thing bruised in that fall
was my spine.

13:48.967 --> 13:50.794
- I'll be delighted.
- Great.

13:50.969 --> 13:53.461
- There's only one thing I ask in return.
- Certainly.

13:53.639 --> 13:54.718
Pull my finger.

13:55.349 --> 13:58.682
So this driving on the left makes you
feel more at home, huh, Hugh?

14:02.690 --> 14:05.809
And tonight, the following
celebrities have been arrested:

14:05.984 --> 14:08.191
Heather Locklear Fortensky
remains at large.

14:09.697 --> 14:12.651
Remember, if you see any celebrities,
consider them dangerous.

14:12.866 --> 14:14.824
You know, I rather like this pub.

14:15.350 --> 14:17.280
An English boy, eh?

14:17.204 --> 14:19.493
You know,
we saved your ass in World War II.

14:19.707 --> 14:21.746
Well, we saved your ass
in World War III.

14:21.959 --> 14:25.458
- That's true.
- There's something I want you to have.

14:25.629 --> 14:28.749
My dad gave me his cuff links to wear
on the day I married Marge.

14:28.924 --> 14:32.708
They brought us good luck.
I couldn't imagine a happier marriage.

14:32.886 --> 14:35.460
We don't have many traditions
in our family.

14:35.639 --> 14:40.301
But it would mean a lot to me
if you kept this one alive.

14:40.519 --> 14:42.262
Well, I'd be honored...

14:42.771 --> 14:46.555
...to wear those things.

14:51.155 --> 14:53.640
Hey, watch those virtual darts.

14:53.282 --> 14:55.607
I'm trying to play virtual pool.

14:58.746 --> 15:00.655
Hey, hey. No fighting in my bar.

15:04.960 --> 15:08.828
You know, Fox turned into
a hardcore-sex channel so gradually...

15:09.600 --> 15:10.797
...I didn't even notice.

15:11.675 --> 15:15.293
It's so great to have the whole family
together under one roof.

15:15.512 --> 15:17.505
I never realized how much I missed it.

15:17.681 --> 15:23.470
Listen to the murmurs in the next room.
The house is full of life again.

15:24.396 --> 15:25.938
Keep it down in there!

15:26.148 --> 15:28.570
All right, Dad.

15:28.233 --> 15:30.903
I'm sorry I left you alone
with Homer and Bart.

15:31.700 --> 15:33.525
No, no, honey. We had a fine time.

15:33.739 --> 15:36.609
- How'd you get that gash?
- When we hid in the Dumpster...

15:36.784 --> 15:40.532
...after the fire alarm went off
in the pornographic-magazine warehouse.

15:40.746 --> 15:42.869
You are so good
to put up with all of this.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.282
Oh, don't be silly, Lisa.

15:45.459 --> 15:47.831
Everything's fine. Really.

15:48.300 --> 15:51.503
Now, go to sleep. We have a big day
ahead of us tomorrow.

15:51.674 --> 15:54.758
A big, long day.

16:01.975 --> 16:04.846
Lisa, I can't believe
it's your wedding day already.

16:05.620 --> 16:09.190
Mom, I feel kind of funny wearing white.
I mean, Milhouse.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.775
Oh, Milhouse doesn't count.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.275
Okay, I've got something old,
that's my pearl necklace.

16:18.450 --> 16:20.194
Something new is the wedding dress.

16:20.369 --> 16:23.536
Something borrowed is this antique
brooch from Hugh's mother.

16:23.747 --> 16:25.455
Now I just need something blue.

16:26.542 --> 16:30.409
- Here.
- Oh, Mom, thanks.

16:40.970 --> 16:45.174
Wow, Lisa. Looking at you makes me
wanna get married for a third time.

16:45.352 --> 16:48.306
I met a really nice exotic dancer
at Hugh's bachelor party.

16:48.522 --> 16:51.856
- Hugh didn't have a bachelor party.
- We had one in his honor.

16:52.651 --> 16:54.525
I had one in his honor.

16:56.238 --> 16:57.519
I went to a strip club.

16:57.740 --> 17:00.859
Well, here goes nothing.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.741
Mum, Dad...

17:05.914 --> 17:07.539
...meet Homer Simpson.

17:07.708 --> 17:09.332
- How do you do?
- Hey. How are you?

17:09.501 --> 17:11.244
Nice to meet you.

17:13.797 --> 17:15.790
You know what's great
about you English?

17:15.965 --> 17:19.501
Octopussy. Man, I must have
seen that movie...

17:19.678 --> 17:20.792
...twice.

17:21.472 --> 17:25.516
Yes. Yes. That's not too bad.

17:28.604 --> 17:30.929
Hey, Krabappel, get in the way
of that bouquet...

17:31.106 --> 17:33.432
...I'll stuff that sunhat
down your neck.

17:34.902 --> 17:37.903
Smithers, take me home.
I'm not fully defrosted.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.527
Nonsense. Just sit down
and rest for a moment.

17:40.741 --> 17:42.532
There you go.

17:43.202 --> 17:45.989
Oh, no. We've got
a little situation here.

17:46.205 --> 17:48.660
I can't feel anything
below my cummerbund.

17:50.626 --> 17:53.295
- Hi, Dad.
- You look great, sweetheart.

17:53.462 --> 17:56.831
- Thanks.
- Little Lisa. Lisa Simpson.

17:57.700 --> 18:00.542
I always felt you were the best thing
my name ever got attached to.

18:00.719 --> 18:04.764
Since you learned to pin your own
diapers, you've been smarter than me.

18:04.973 --> 18:07.595
- Oh, Dad.
- No, no. Let me finish.

18:07.810 --> 18:10.301
I want you to know
I've always been proud of you.

18:10.479 --> 18:13.682
You're my greatest accomplishment,
and you did it all yourself.

18:13.857 --> 18:16.146
You helped me understand
my own wife better...

18:16.318 --> 18:20.190
...and taught me to be a better person.
But you're also my daughter.

18:20.197 --> 18:23.320
I don't think anybody could've had
a better daughter...

18:23.242 --> 18:26.445
- Dad, you're babbling.
- See? You're still helping me.

18:28.747 --> 18:31.534
Hey, Dad, did you forget to give
those cuff links to Hugh?

18:32.918 --> 18:34.199
- No.
- Well?

18:34.378 --> 18:35.955
I found them on the nightstand.

18:36.130 --> 18:38.455
I guess they weren't his cup of tea.
Don't worry.

18:38.632 --> 18:40.839
But you've been going on
about these all week.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.919
I'm sure he just forgot.

18:44.130 --> 18:47.179
Lisa, we're not supposed to see
each other before the wedding.

18:47.349 --> 18:50.469
- It's tradition.
- What about my family's tradition?

18:50.644 --> 18:54.642
Surely you don't want me to wear those
in front of my parents and their friends.

18:54.815 --> 18:58.231
- But you promised my dad you would.
- I was just humoring him.

18:58.402 --> 19:01.356
- Actually, he frightens me a bit.
- I know they look silly...

19:01.530 --> 19:03.688
...but his feelings will be hurt.

19:03.907 --> 19:05.567
Fine.

19:05.743 --> 19:09.760
I must say, you were right.
This has been quite trying.

19:09.288 --> 19:12.242
I've attempted to enjoy your family
on a personal level...

19:12.416 --> 19:16.496
...on an ironic level, as a novelty,
as camp, as kitsch...

19:16.670 --> 19:19.505
...as cautionary example.
Nothing works.

19:19.673 --> 19:23.700
When we get back to England,
we won't have to deal with them.

19:23.218 --> 19:25.211
You saying we won't
see my family again?

19:25.429 --> 19:27.967
Your mother will come
when the children are born.

19:28.140 --> 19:31.474
I can't believe I'm hearing this.
I don't wanna cut my family out.

19:31.643 --> 19:34.644
Really? Lisa, you're better
than this place.

19:34.813 --> 19:37.200
You're like a flower
that grew out of dirt.

19:37.483 --> 19:39.890
- That's a horrible thing to say.
- Oh, come on.

19:40.690 --> 19:44.529
- You complain more than anyone.
- Maybe, but I still love them.

19:44.740 --> 19:48.323
And I don't think you understand that.

19:52.957 --> 19:55.494
And now, to sing "Amazing Grace"...

19:55.709 --> 19:57.916
...Miss Maggie Simpson.

19:58.754 --> 20:01.541
She's quite a hellion,
but does have an incredible voice.

20:03.967 --> 20:06.719
Stop everything.
The wedding has been called off.

20:13.185 --> 20:15.806
This is very sad news.

20:16.210 --> 20:20.517
It never would've happened if the
wedding was in the church with God...

20:20.693 --> 20:24.477
...instead of out here
in the cheap showiness of nature.

20:24.697 --> 20:26.654
Who wants cake?

20:43.299 --> 20:47.711
The next day, Hugh goes back to
England, and you never see him again.

20:49.263 --> 20:52.180
Now that I know, isn't there any way
to change the future?

20:52.391 --> 20:54.882
No. But try to look surprised.

20:55.102 --> 20:57.178
You said you'd tell me
about my true love.

20:57.354 --> 20:59.513
Oh, you'll have a true love.

20:59.732 --> 21:02.270
But I specialize in foretelling
the relationships...

21:02.443 --> 21:04.352
...where you get jerked around.

21:17.708 --> 21:20.792
Lisa, where were you?
You missed the most incredible thing.

21:21.300 --> 21:24.870
- Hi, Dad.
- I ate seven pounds of fudge.

21:25.674 --> 21:28.820
The man at the stand said
it was a record.

21:28.260 --> 21:29.589
What else did you do, Dad?

21:29.762 --> 21:33.344
I rode the tea cups. Then I got
a little sick, and I had to sit down.

21:33.515 --> 21:35.638
But then I rode them again.
