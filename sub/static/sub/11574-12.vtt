WEBVTT

00:07.800 --> 00:12.760
[humming]

00:16.559 --> 00:17.969
Someone's up early.

00:18.060 --> 00:20.597
Rise and shine, my new mantra.

00:20.688 --> 00:21.803
You got something special planned?

00:21.898 --> 00:23.889
My Aunt Vera. You know,
the one with the man hands.

00:23.983 --> 00:27.146
She's having this big [Russian] party.

00:27.236 --> 00:31.730
You know, all the borscht and
[Russian] a girl could ever hope for.

00:31.824 --> 00:33.564
Sounds festive.

00:33.659 --> 00:37.823
No one's ever really used "festive"
to describe our family gatherings.

00:37.914 --> 00:42.829
More like obnoxious, semi-psychotic,
deviant, but never festive.

00:42.919 --> 00:45.126
You know, if you're not doing anything,
I could swing you an invite.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.704
My cousin, Juris, will be there
and he's been dying to meet you.

00:47.798 --> 00:48.958
Didn't he just get out of jail?

00:49.050 --> 00:50.005
No, that's Pavel.

00:50.092 --> 00:52.219
Juris' the one that works
as a mortician's apprentice.

00:52.303 --> 00:54.385
Yeah, and once you get past
the smell of embalming fluid,

00:54.472 --> 00:56.463
he's actually kind of fun.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.593
Maybe some other time.

00:58.684 --> 01:01.892
Well, I'm off to my run.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.311
Okay, well, stay on the
shoulder of the road.

01:04.398 --> 01:08.687
And don't forget to hydrate.
And avoid small bitey dogs.

01:14.492 --> 01:17.529
She's totally clueless. We're on.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.538
So, what's next on the agenda, torture?

01:30.633 --> 01:32.965
l was hoping you'd be
ready to go back to work.

01:36.347 --> 01:39.009
You lock me in a dungeon for four days,

01:39.100 --> 01:42.433
I'm supposed to be so grateful
to be let out that ljust

01:42.520 --> 01:45.011
head back to the lab as
though nothing happened?

01:45.106 --> 01:47.563
You've forgotten your place here.

01:47.650 --> 01:50.983
| just refuse to play anymore.

01:51.070 --> 01:54.028
I'm going to pack my things and
take my chances with the Morrigan,

01:54.115 --> 01:55.821
because she seems to
know a hell of a lot more

01:55.908 --> 01:59.446
about Nadia's condition than you do.

01:59.537 --> 02:04.452
I can assure you that if you so much as try
to make any contact with the Morrigan,

02:04.542 --> 02:07.079
punishment will be swift and severe.

02:07.169 --> 02:10.457
As severe as five years
of indentured servitude?

02:10.548 --> 02:15.212
We seem to have got off on the
wrong foot this morning, Doctor.

02:15.303 --> 02:18.670
Well, that will happen when
you lock someone in a dungeon.

02:18.764 --> 02:22.757
I called you up here because
I've some information about Nadia.

02:22.852 --> 02:25.639
| read the journals of the former Ash.

02:25.730 --> 02:29.973
I discovered who ordered
the curse on Nadia.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.649
It was the Ash himself.

02:32.737 --> 02:34.318
What?

02:37.241 --> 02:39.698
--Why?
--|t's obvious, really.

02:41.996 --> 02:45.454
He needed a cure for the outbreak
that was ravaging the Fae

02:45.541 --> 02:47.998
and he saw in you someone
who could provide that.

02:48.085 --> 02:52.419
He pulled you into the
fold and kept you there.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.087
It was a lie?

02:54.175 --> 02:56.291
I worked night and day for the Ash.

02:56.385 --> 02:57.670
I don't condone what he did,

02:57.762 --> 02:59.969
but you're just going to have
to put that all behind you now.

03:00.056 --> 03:03.423
And what? Continue working here?

03:03.517 --> 03:05.633
I'd rather burn the place to the ground.

03:05.728 --> 03:09.312
That wouldn't bring you any closer
to Nadia's recovery now, would it?

03:09.398 --> 03:14.392
Besides, I believe I've located the
shaman who placed the curse on Nadia.

03:14.487 --> 03:16.853
He's in a village in the Congo.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.448
I can go there. I can talk to him.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.945
No, it's not that simple.
This one's Dark Fae.

03:22.036 --> 03:25.073
Lauren, I will do everything
in my power to help Nadia.

03:25.164 --> 03:29.954
For now, I'd appreciate it if
you just cleaned yourself up

03:30.044 --> 03:31.830
and got back to work.

03:48.938 --> 03:51.850
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

03:51.941 --> 03:54.853
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

03:54.944 --> 03:57.856
My love carries a death sentence.

03:57.947 --> 04:00.029
l was lost for years,

04:00.116 --> 04:02.778
searching, while hiding,

04:02.868 --> 04:07.032
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

04:07.123 --> 04:11.992
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

04:17.675 --> 04:21.759
Just the kind and generous
man I wanted to see.

04:23.431 --> 04:24.216
How much you need?

04:24.265 --> 04:25.220
Now that you mention it,

04:25.307 --> 04:27.684
I am trying to raise funds for
the most kick-ass hors d'ouevres

04:27.768 --> 04:29.554
you've ever wrapped your
sweet tongue around.

04:29.645 --> 04:32.682
I prefer cash, but I will take
credit cards or money orders.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.229
Cool. Put me down for ten.

04:34.316 --> 04:37.183
Ten'll get us a bag of chips
and some generic brand salsa.

04:37.278 --> 04:40.361
Come on, man, this is
Bo's special, special day.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.440
You're right. I'll give her the ten.

04:43.534 --> 04:45.570
Well played. I'll put
you down for a tenski.

04:45.661 --> 04:47.322
And you're still getting the cake, right?

04:47.413 --> 04:49.620
Cake?!

04:49.707 --> 04:51.538
I'm on it.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.002
Trickster, I can still count
on you for the hooch, yeah?

04:54.086 --> 04:56.077
Like I told you yesterday
and the day before that

04:56.172 --> 04:58.037
and the day before that,
I got it covered.

04:58.132 --> 04:59.212
I'm sorry.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.291
ljust--| don't want to
forget anything, you know?

05:01.385 --> 05:04.377
I still got the decorations and the
ice and the cups and the band and--

05:04.472 --> 05:05.803
"Band?
"Yeah,dude.

05:05.890 --> 05:07.426
This soiree's got to rock.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.097
You know, there's nothing
too good for my--

05:09.185 --> 05:10.049
Bo!

05:10.144 --> 05:11.600
--Hey.
[KENZI] Hey!

05:11.687 --> 05:13.302
Um, how was your run?

05:13.397 --> 05:15.433
Oh, like every day, a grind.

05:15.524 --> 05:19.642
Yes, but every day, you still do it.
Isn't that the definition of insanity?

05:19.737 --> 05:21.193
Hey, Hale. What's new?

05:21.280 --> 05:24.864
Ah, same old, you know. Just...

05:24.950 --> 05:27.157
You got any big plans for the weekend?

05:27.244 --> 05:29.496
You know, there's this
club opening tonight,

05:29.580 --> 05:31.366
so I thought I'd check that out.

05:31.457 --> 05:33.618
[BO] Oh, cool.

05:33.709 --> 05:34.949
What about you, Trick?

05:35.044 --> 05:36.580
You're looking at it.

05:36.670 --> 05:40.083
Barkeeper's job doesn't
end until the taps are dry.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.631
--How about you?
--Nothing special.

05:42.718 --> 05:45.175
I thought maybe I'd give Lauren a call.
I haven't talked to her in awhile

05:45.262 --> 05:48.379
and I thought I'd see if she'd
get shore leave for a night.

05:48.474 --> 05:50.135
[cell phone ringing]

05:50.226 --> 05:52.137
Ah. Speak of the devil.

05:52.228 --> 05:53.684
Hey.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.642
Why?

05:57.733 --> 06:00.019
Yes.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.487
All right.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.527
I take it not Lauren.

06:04.615 --> 06:05.946
It was Lachlan.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.820
--What did he want?
--He wants to see me.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.281
Lemon and sugar?

06:15.376 --> 06:18.914
I'm good, thanks.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.960
Why am I here?

06:23.384 --> 06:26.342
Always so impatient.

06:26.428 --> 06:30.637
You got to learn to enjoy the moment,
Bo, or life will just pass you by.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.682
You called me here to preach
fortune cookie philosophy?

06:33.769 --> 06:37.227
No, I called you here because I have
some information regarding Nadia.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.396
--You have my attention.
--|'ve located the shaman

06:39.483 --> 06:41.565
that put the curse on her.
I thought you might pay him a visit

06:41.652 --> 06:44.689
and persuade him to remove
the nail and lift the curse.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.736
--Why me?
--The shaman is a Dark Fae

06:46.824 --> 06:48.485
mystic known as Tshombe.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.817
Lives in a small, little
village in the Congo.

06:50.911 --> 06:54.904
Since you are unaligned and have a
certain personal interest in the matter,

06:54.999 --> 06:57.615
you are the perfect
candidate for the job.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.165
I appreciate you telling me.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.371
Oh, and there's one other thing.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.454
Oh, here we go.

07:04.550 --> 07:07.462
It's so simple, yet very, very critical.

07:07.553 --> 07:10.169
You can never tell Lauren
that you're doing this.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.174
Why not?

07:11.265 --> 07:13.722
Because the nail can only be removed

07:13.809 --> 07:17.722
if the person making the request has
got complete and utter selfless love,

07:17.813 --> 07:21.101
which is then exemplified by performing
a life-changing favour for someone

07:21.191 --> 07:24.024
without them ever being aware of it.

07:24.111 --> 07:27.854
I don't make up the rules,
but you must accept this as fact

07:27.948 --> 07:30.280
or you will not be successful.

07:32.870 --> 07:36.909
Well, I don't need credit
for helping a friend.

07:36.999 --> 07:40.241
| only care about the results.

07:40.336 --> 07:43.248
Can I at least see Lauren before I go?

07:43.339 --> 07:44.749
No.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.796
She's in the middle of a very
critical analysis right now

07:46.884 --> 07:47.999
and can't be disturbed.

07:48.093 --> 07:51.085
So, how exactly do | find this Tshombe?

07:55.100 --> 07:56.260
It's my travel agent.

07:56.352 --> 07:58.513
I'll call ahead and make
all the arrangements.

08:00.147 --> 08:05.107
[Russian]

08:09.448 --> 08:10.779
What was that all about?

08:10.866 --> 08:14.450
My cousin Dima is helping
me out with the party favours.

08:14.536 --> 08:17.073
--Party favours?
--Every chic party hostess

08:17.164 --> 08:18.700
gives her guests a little gift.

08:18.791 --> 08:20.031
And what would that little gift be?

08:20.125 --> 08:23.959
Dima's getting me a load of digital
cameras fresh off the boat from Japan.

08:24.046 --> 08:25.627
The guests can snap away tonight

08:25.714 --> 08:28.000
and then I can make Bo
an album of party pics.

08:28.092 --> 08:31.004
I really don't want to know
the answer, but I've got to ask--

08:31.095 --> 08:34.929
how is cousin Dima
acquiring these cameras?

08:35.015 --> 08:37.848
You got the cake! Oh my god!

08:37.935 --> 08:39.391
Uh huh.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.351
Hey, roomie, what's up?

08:45.442 --> 08:47.307
I've just got to grab
something upstairs.

08:47.403 --> 08:49.064
--Girl's focused.
--Yeah, when she gets like that,

08:49.154 --> 08:51.110
it usually means trouble.

08:52.241 --> 08:54.482
Hey, hon-buns, where are you off to?

08:54.576 --> 08:55.565
Africa.

08:55.661 --> 08:58.903
Africa? As in the dark
continent with your sword?

08:58.997 --> 09:01.079
Is there something
you want to tell me?

09:01.166 --> 09:03.623
Kenzi, I can't really
talk right now, okay?

09:03.711 --> 09:06.669
Well, are you going to
be home for dinner?

09:14.346 --> 09:15.847
Hi.

09:15.931 --> 09:18.923
--Number?
--[BO] Number?

09:19.017 --> 09:20.473
Number.

09:33.824 --> 09:35.280
Twenty-three?

09:37.327 --> 09:39.613
You must be Bo.

09:39.705 --> 09:42.617
lam Bashira Falak Manar,
but you can call me Peggy.

09:42.708 --> 09:45.700
So, Peggy, how exactly
am | getting to Africa?

09:45.794 --> 09:47.534
Plane, train?

09:47.629 --> 09:51.588
No. We reserve that mode of
travel for our human clientele.

09:51.675 --> 09:53.961
For you, | fold the Earth.

09:54.052 --> 09:54.916
You seem confused.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.172
No. I've just never--

09:56.263 --> 09:57.969
Oh, no, no, of course you haven't.

09:58.056 --> 10:01.514
I'm the only Fae travel agent in
this area sanctioned by the Ash.

10:01.602 --> 10:04.594
In conventional travel,
you move toward the destination.

10:04.688 --> 10:08.806
Here, the destination moves
towards you, in the blink of an eye.

10:08.901 --> 10:12.393
You merely stand still and the
Earth is displaced under your feet.

10:12.488 --> 10:13.819
Well, is it safe?

10:13.906 --> 10:15.612
Safe is such a relative term.

10:15.699 --> 10:17.064
I mean, there are the normal risks,

10:17.159 --> 10:19.195
headaches, swelling of
the joints, severe nose bleeds.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.242
And in some very limited cases, death.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.662
--Death?
--Mhm. Accident waiver.

10:23.749 --> 10:28.914
Simply sign at the bottom and initial
it here, here, here, and of course here.

10:30.214 --> 10:32.500
Oh, if you're concerned
about your loved ones,

10:32.591 --> 10:35.003
I offer very attractive travel insurance.

10:35.093 --> 10:38.585
It's easy on the wallet and
pays excellent death benefits.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.636
I'm good, thanks.

10:43.602 --> 10:46.560
Okay. So, what now?

10:46.647 --> 10:48.262
Happy trails.

11:12.381 --> 11:13.837
Tshombe?

11:21.098 --> 11:25.512
I'm here about a cursing nail
that you put into a block of wood.

11:47.124 --> 11:49.957
Are you okay?

11:50.043 --> 11:51.874
Thank you, child.

11:51.962 --> 11:55.921
I am nearing the end of my journey.

11:56.008 --> 11:58.795
You are here on behalf
of a cursed soul?

11:58.886 --> 12:01.548
Yes. A woman named Nadia.

12:01.638 --> 12:04.254
Nadia.

12:08.228 --> 12:13.018
These nails were placed
here for a reason.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.394
Aren't shamans
supposed to be healers?

12:15.485 --> 12:18.613
Do you have any idea how much pain
you've caused these people's families?

12:18.697 --> 12:22.861
Every time a person is cursed,

12:22.951 --> 12:27.945
it shifts the fortunes of others.

12:28.040 --> 12:33.125
Who is to say the world
is not a better place?

12:35.213 --> 12:37.795
Nadia.

12:37.883 --> 12:39.464
Pull it out.

12:39.551 --> 12:46.514
The one who ordered
this curse paid handsomely.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.886
Someone paid you
to put a curse on her?

12:48.977 --> 12:53.721
The former Ash of your region.

12:53.815 --> 12:57.103
The leader of the Light Fae made
a deal with a Dark Fae shaman?

12:57.194 --> 13:01.608
The Light do not mind compromise

13:01.698 --> 13:06.032
when they feel the ends
justifies the means.

13:06.119 --> 13:09.611
Cursing Nadia ensured that Lauren
would do everything in her power

13:09.706 --> 13:11.617
to find an antidote to the Fae fever.

13:11.708 --> 13:17.328
And because of that,
several hundred Fae were cured.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.083
How much to pull out the nail?

13:19.174 --> 13:24.965
The goddess Ama possessed
a sacred healing mask

13:25.055 --> 13:30.140
and gave it to a revered
shaman in Mali.

13:30.227 --> 13:33.094
Two years ago, it was stolen.

13:33.188 --> 13:37.431
Find it. Bring it to me.

13:37.526 --> 13:39.357
Where do | find it?

13:39.444 --> 13:42.277
It was stolen by a Preta.

13:42.364 --> 13:48.234
Last I heard, he was hiding
somewhere in Madagascar.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.616
You must hurry.

13:51.707 --> 13:55.291
I do not know if I will survive the night.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.803
Okay.

14:09.891 --> 14:14.681
Wow. All right. Thank you, guys.
I will definitely be in touch.

14:22.404 --> 14:25.487
[knocking]

14:25.574 --> 14:30.193
--Yeah?
--Hey. I'm here about the uh...

14:30.287 --> 14:31.743
Kenzi?

14:33.081 --> 14:34.196
Nate?

14:34.291 --> 14:36.657
Little Kenzi from next door?

14:36.752 --> 14:38.868
Oh, what's it been, like, fifteen years?

14:38.962 --> 14:42.295
Sixteen years and three months.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.589
Not that l was actually keeping track.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.541
Come in.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.672
Where have you been?

14:48.764 --> 14:50.470
Where did you go
when you moved away?

14:50.557 --> 14:52.718
And why didn't you call me?

14:52.809 --> 14:57.018
Seattle, Reno and... you were six.

14:57.105 --> 15:00.142
Dude, for the longest time, I had myself
convinced it was an alien abduction.

15:00.233 --> 15:04.317
Close. It was my mom.

15:04.404 --> 15:08.238
So, is this all yours?

15:08.325 --> 15:11.067
Yeah, you know,
I share it with my roomie.

15:11.161 --> 15:13.777
It's actually her birthday.

15:13.872 --> 15:16.955
"Very exclusive party gig.

15:17.042 --> 15:19.328
High profile. Low pay."

15:19.419 --> 15:21.535
Very exclusive, yeah.

15:23.924 --> 15:26.381
So, have you found anyone yet?

15:26.468 --> 15:28.299
l have now.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.517
Hey.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.262
Kind of early for ya.

15:36.353 --> 15:38.309
Coffee or beer?

15:38.396 --> 15:40.682
--Beer.
--|t's been that kind of morning has it?

15:40.774 --> 15:42.639
Ciara's house shopping.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.850
Oh, I see.

15:50.867 --> 15:54.860
Wow. Five thousand square feet
on two acres of land?

15:54.955 --> 15:56.445
6.5 million?

15:56.540 --> 16:00.783
All that and a beautiful girlfriend
and you're stressed out?

16:00.877 --> 16:05.371
You know, most men would give at least
one appendage to be in your shoes.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.375
I know.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.003
My friend, at some point, you're going
to have to sort out your emotions.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.049
That's what I've been struggling to do

16:10.137 --> 16:12.549
ever since Ciara came
back into my life, Trick.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.300
Actually, you've been
struggling with them since you

16:14.391 --> 16:16.347
came back from the Norn.

16:18.311 --> 16:22.020
I need to know everything you can
tell me about something called a Preta.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.313
If you're planning a Preta hunt,

16:23.400 --> 16:25.891
I'd suggest you'd bring
along some backup.

16:29.573 --> 16:32.189
Preta are extremely greedy creatures,

16:32.284 --> 16:36.072
driven to satisfy their desires,
but unable to fulfill them.

16:36.163 --> 16:39.655
Some have insatiable appetites,
but can't swallow food.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.410
Others have unquenchable thirst,

16:41.501 --> 16:44.117
but when liquid touches
their lips, it evaporates.

16:44.212 --> 16:47.454
Others still have overwhelming
sexual urges, but--

16:47.549 --> 16:50.586
Fae E.D., | get the picture.

16:50.677 --> 16:54.511
This Preta has an unstoppable
lust for treasures.

16:54.598 --> 16:56.634
He was stealing valuables in Africa.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.056
Sounds like he could be your man.

16:58.143 --> 16:59.724
Well, do you've any
idea where to find him?

16:59.811 --> 17:03.429
Madagascar is a big place
and I don't have a lot of time.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.855
His last known location was

17:05.942 --> 17:09.355
in the catacombs under the
First Christ Church in Sambava.

17:09.446 --> 17:12.483
You know, I've heard a lot of stories
about people going into Preta dens,

17:12.574 --> 17:14.860
but no stories about
people coming back out.

17:14.951 --> 17:18.193
--Are you scared?
--|ntrigued.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.404
You have to offer the Preta a trade.

17:20.498 --> 17:23.035
Something of value.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.458
Well, I don't have anything.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.580
Take this.

17:26.671 --> 17:29.162
Oh, Trick, it's beautiful.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.213
It was my wife's.

17:32.677 --> 17:35.544
Your wife?

17:35.639 --> 17:37.595
How come you've never
told me about her before?

17:37.682 --> 17:41.220
I will, in time.

17:41.311 --> 17:42.972
Oh, Trick, I could never take this.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.894
I'm sure she'd approve.

17:44.981 --> 17:48.098
--I don't know what to say.
--You've already said it.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.774
Good luck.

17:53.114 --> 17:55.446
I really appreciate
you helping me with this.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.990
Nah, I had nothing better to do today.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.569
Besides, what are friends for?

18:00.664 --> 18:02.996
Come on, let's go get us a mask.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.831
How many people are
coming to this party?

18:08.922 --> 18:10.253
About a dozen.

18:10.340 --> 18:11.500
By the size of this box,

18:11.591 --> 18:14.003
looks like you have enough
cameras for the whole block.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.675
Well, if there happen
to be a few extras,

18:15.762 --> 18:18.219
I'm betting they'd catch
a few rubles on Ebay.

18:18.306 --> 18:20.388
What do say we split the
profits seventy-thirty?

18:20.475 --> 18:21.840
Officer of the law.

18:21.935 --> 18:25.177
Sixty-forty. Dude, you
drive a hard bargain.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.481
What the...?

18:31.820 --> 18:35.312
Ah... so, where's the lens?

18:35.407 --> 18:37.739
Dima got the wrong box.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.691
Well, you can't really
blame him, now can you?

18:39.786 --> 18:42.653
It's kind of dark out there on the
docks in the middle of the night.

18:42.747 --> 18:45.238
Dude, what am I supposed
to do for party favours?

18:45.333 --> 18:47.870
[hissing] Give them a creepy cat.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.168
No. This is a disaster.

18:50.255 --> 18:54.544
Nah, it's not so bad. We have cake.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.499
Oh, cake.

18:59.514 --> 19:02.301
Yeah. Just looking at it
makes my mouth happy.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.020
Ahhh! Don't you...

19:06.104 --> 19:10.643
Bo will never miss a little icing. Mmm.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.361
What's wrong?

19:21.119 --> 19:26.659
Ahh! A worm! Oh my god,
I just had a worm in my mouth!

19:26.750 --> 19:28.286
lam not happy!

19:28.376 --> 19:31.664
I should have known an organic
Fairy bakery would use worms.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.996
Probably got ladybugs in there, too.

19:35.759 --> 19:37.966
--Ladybugs?
--Yeah.

19:41.389 --> 19:45.678
We need two tickets to Sambava.
The catacombs at First Christ Church.

19:45.769 --> 19:46.975
Number?

19:47.062 --> 19:49.098
--Rea|ly?
--Yeah.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.813
Seventy-eig ht?

19:59.908 --> 20:02.149
That's us.

20:02.243 --> 20:08.455
So, Sambava. Madagascar is beautiful
this time of year. Honeymoon?

20:08.541 --> 20:11.453
--Business trip.
--Oh, touchy subject.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.705
Would you like a window or an aisle?

20:15.298 --> 20:16.538
A little Fae travel humour.

20:16.633 --> 20:19.545
Listen, Peggy, we are in a big hurry.

20:19.636 --> 20:22.002
Well, fasten your seatbelt.

20:24.682 --> 20:26.718
That's quite impressive.

20:26.810 --> 20:28.346
And efficient.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.394
Would've been a crappy
place for a honeymoon.

20:35.485 --> 20:38.101
You're here to trade.

20:38.196 --> 20:40.357
Yes.

20:40.448 --> 20:41.904
Come.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.751
[DYSON] You've been busy.

20:59.843 --> 21:02.004
It's my nature.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.084
To steal?

21:03.179 --> 21:07.843
Yes. And endure the torture of
not being able to enjoy the spoils.

21:07.934 --> 21:13.429
Merely looking at a Bernini
should bring pleasure,

21:13.523 --> 21:17.357
but my satisfaction is purely tactile.

21:17.444 --> 21:20.231
I need to caress the art.

21:20.321 --> 21:25.281
Feel its exquisite lines
to have any sense of joy.

21:25.368 --> 21:27.108
Unfortunately...

21:33.376 --> 21:36.743
Once I obtain an object
and bring it back to my den,

21:36.838 --> 21:38.794
I can never touch it again.

21:38.882 --> 21:40.747
Then why steal all this?

21:40.842 --> 21:43.003
That is my fate.

21:44.554 --> 21:47.421
I hope one day,
my affliction will be gone.

21:47.515 --> 21:53.727
And when it is, I'll bathe myself
in jewels and gold and silver.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.394
Sounds uncomfortable.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.643
What have you brought to trade?

22:02.822 --> 22:04.938
Place it on there.

22:05.033 --> 22:09.572
Careful, the sand is very dangerous.

22:09.662 --> 22:13.826
lt retains the same destructive
quality as my touch.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.853
The bracelet in exchange for what?

22:40.944 --> 22:45.779
A healing mask said to be from Ama.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.651
I know the one.

22:57.835 --> 22:59.621
Hey,babe.

23:02.423 --> 23:05.210
Sorry I haven't been here to
see you for the past few days,

23:05.301 --> 23:09.715
it's just been kind of
busy and, you know...

23:15.603 --> 23:17.719
Why am | lying to you?

23:20.817 --> 23:25.811
Truth is the Ash held me prisoner.

23:25.905 --> 23:29.864
I guess we've both been prisoners
for the past five years, huh?

23:31.911 --> 23:34.903
But maybe that's all
going to change soon.

23:34.998 --> 23:37.330
I don't want to get my hopes up,

23:37.417 --> 23:41.035
but there could be a light
at the end of the tunnel.

23:43.840 --> 23:48.709
And maybe someday real soon,
you'll wake up from your long sleep.

23:53.349 --> 23:56.136
And maybe I'll get to hold you again.

24:06.446 --> 24:07.902
The mask.

24:09.157 --> 24:12.570
Retrieve it and the trade is complete.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.571
It's a trap.

24:14.662 --> 24:17.404
Not a trap, merely part of your quest.

24:17.498 --> 24:20.581
The most cherished treasures
are the most difficult to come by.

24:20.668 --> 24:25.253
Danger only increases one's
appreciation for the prize.

24:25.340 --> 24:28.298
I already appreciate the mask plenty.

24:28.384 --> 24:31.547
You have the bracelet, just give us
the mask and we can be on our way.

24:31.638 --> 24:34.846
I set the terms.

24:34.932 --> 24:41.519
By the way, the piles are the remains
of the last people who came to trade.

24:48.196 --> 24:49.777
Fantastic.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.202
--|'|| go.
--No.

24:55.286 --> 24:56.992
l have to do this.

25:12.387 --> 25:13.843
Bo, wait.

25:16.391 --> 25:19.098
This material doesn't disintegrate.

25:19.185 --> 25:22.928
It's the same as your robe.
It's not affected.

25:24.315 --> 25:27.182
Try this, I think it'll
give you a safe path.

25:27.276 --> 25:28.732
Great.

25:36.119 --> 25:38.701
Dyson, we've got a problem.

25:45.002 --> 25:46.663
That isn't fair.

25:46.754 --> 25:48.290
My terms.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.837
Here's mine.

25:54.429 --> 25:56.215
Bo, cover yourself!

25:59.016 --> 26:02.258
You choose to take those and leave
her behind? That's not our deal.

26:02.353 --> 26:03.809
Deal's off.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.479
They can't hurt me.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.023
You're missing the point.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.485
They're my treasures!

26:16.367 --> 26:18.198
Not the Michelangelo!

26:31.591 --> 26:33.081
--|'ve got it.
--Then let's go.

26:33.176 --> 26:34.382
Trick's bracelet.

26:34.469 --> 26:35.834
Bo, what are you doing? It's gone.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.670
lt belonged to his wife.
I have to bring back something.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.756
Okay. Come on, let's go.

26:42.769 --> 26:46.307
No!

26:48.483 --> 26:51.316
P You dreamer, young girl,
you dream in a whirl P

26:51.402 --> 26:54.735
P Where your haunted soul survives P

26:54.822 --> 26:57.609
P The camouflage breeze,
the glorious seas P

26:57.700 --> 27:00.817
P This bone-dry land still alive P

27:00.912 --> 27:05.702
P But you're holding every moment
like it's about to get stolen away P

27:07.835 --> 27:14.422
D And you're closing every door
I walk up to hoping to stay P

27:14.509 --> 27:17.751
P It's all right, all right, all right P

27:17.845 --> 27:21.087
P It's okay P

27:21.182 --> 27:26.302
P I'll wait, I'll wait P

27:27.980 --> 27:29.811
You're staring.

27:29.899 --> 27:33.141
I'm just listening intensely.

27:33.236 --> 27:35.943
Isn't that what I'm supposed to do?

27:36.030 --> 27:39.864
Yeah. It's weird sitting here with you.

27:39.951 --> 27:42.192
I think it's karma.

27:42.286 --> 27:47.997
Or kismet or some other K word that
means we were meant to meet again.

27:48.084 --> 27:50.996
Maybe, but it's still weird.

27:51.087 --> 27:54.124
I mean, you were the
cute little girl next door

27:54.215 --> 27:58.128
who used to dance around all day in a
tutu with a big, pink bow in her hair.

27:58.219 --> 28:00.255
Well, you were the
cute older guy next door

28:02.723 --> 28:04.509
You did not see me in my underwear.

28:04.600 --> 28:08.263
Fruit of the Loom, if I'm not mistaken.

28:08.354 --> 28:12.643
Ah, well, you know, it was hot in there.
We didn't have air conditioning, so...

28:12.733 --> 28:14.064
Yeah, I can't believe you spied on me.

28:14.151 --> 28:19.236
Hey, what can I say? l was a
precocious six-year-old in love.

28:21.284 --> 28:24.447
I don't mean love-love, | just mean--

28:24.537 --> 28:26.448
You mean you were six.

28:26.539 --> 28:27.995
Yeah.

28:32.169 --> 28:35.081
So, are you seeing anyone now?

28:35.172 --> 28:38.130
Seeing as in dating, as in a
quasi to serious relationship?

28:38.217 --> 28:40.128
Yeah, just like that.

28:40.219 --> 28:46.010
Not to sound like a total loser,
but no, nothing even remote.

28:48.477 --> 28:49.933
You?

28:51.022 --> 28:53.434
No, I haven't found my soul mate yet.

28:55.985 --> 28:58.146
That's too bad.

29:01.365 --> 29:02.400
--Number?
--Don't!

29:02.491 --> 29:03.446
Someone's got a bit of jet lag.

29:03.534 --> 29:05.149
I need to get back to
the Congo right away.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.530
Do you need any assistance
with hotels or rental cars?

29:07.622 --> 29:09.954
Just there and back!

29:11.667 --> 29:15.535
Thank you very much. I could not
have done this without you.

29:15.630 --> 29:19.043
| always wanted to see
Madagascar. Good luck.

29:19.133 --> 29:21.419
Can I interest you in
our frequent flyer plan?

29:21.510 --> 29:24.752
If you sign up today, you start collecting
points and look, you get a free T-shirt.

29:24.847 --> 29:29.216
Maybe next time. | just need
to get back to the Congo.

29:31.687 --> 29:33.643
No, no, no, no, no.

29:48.579 --> 29:51.161
--Are you okay?
--Better.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.707
Okay.

29:57.129 --> 30:00.621
I saved your life. Now save Nadia's.

30:27.159 --> 30:35.703
By honouring our pact, you now
have the power to remove the nail.

30:50.433 --> 30:51.889
Huh? Whoa.

31:31.307 --> 31:32.763
Lauren.

31:38.981 --> 31:41.438
You have ended the curse on Nadia.

31:41.525 --> 31:44.267
You do not have the power
to remove other nails.

31:44.361 --> 31:47.524
Those nails can only be removed...

31:47.615 --> 31:49.446
No one has ever done that before.

31:49.533 --> 31:52.320
Well, maybe no one's ever been
this motivated to right your wrongs.

31:52.411 --> 31:55.118
Stop! You have no idea
what you are doing.

31:55.206 --> 31:58.323
Yes, I do! I'm freeing innocent people.

31:58.417 --> 32:03.081
Not all the cursed are innocent
people, not even by your standards.

32:03.172 --> 32:06.790
This one is a violent man who
beats his wife and children.

32:06.884 --> 32:09.751
This is a traitor who led
his soldiers into battle

32:09.845 --> 32:11.096
where they were slaughtered.

32:11.180 --> 32:13.546
None of these curses
were made lightly.

32:13.641 --> 32:15.256
Each one has a reason.

32:15.351 --> 32:18.058
You have no right to be judge and jury.

32:18.145 --> 32:21.729
And what makes you believe
that you have the right?

32:30.533 --> 32:34.526
Maybe we just have to agree that
neither of us has the right.

32:45.131 --> 32:49.295
No! No!

32:52.096 --> 32:56.135
Nope, that'll be fine. Yeah, I'll have my
lawyers look over everything in the morning.

32:56.225 --> 33:00.594
Great. Great, thanks. All right. Bye.

33:03.274 --> 33:05.560
How was your day?

33:05.651 --> 33:06.640
It was good.

33:06.735 --> 33:08.566
Catch any bad guys?

33:08.654 --> 33:13.148
No, but I taught one a lesson.

33:14.952 --> 33:17.819
How was your day?

33:17.913 --> 33:20.029
I bought a new house.

33:20.124 --> 33:21.580
I thought you were
just window shopping.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.374
l-l-l was, but I fell in love
with the third place I saw

33:24.461 --> 33:27.043
and there were five offers on it.
I had to pay a little over asking price,

33:27.131 --> 33:30.589
but I couldn't resist. It's a modern.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.792
Concrete. Glass. Bamboo floors.

33:32.887 --> 33:35.424
The sunlight pours in
and it looks like heaven.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.891
Huge barbecue pit and
a gigantic master suite

33:37.975 --> 33:41.559
with his and hers walk-in closets and...

33:41.645 --> 33:43.260
Sounds fantastic.

33:43.355 --> 33:46.222
ljust hope you love it as much as I do.

33:48.944 --> 33:51.196
And l was able to get the
mask from the Preta,

33:51.280 --> 33:54.613
deliver it to Tshombe and
pull out Nadia's cursing nail.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.736
So, you've had a busy day then.

33:56.827 --> 33:59.364
Was I successful?

33:59.455 --> 34:03.243
I believe you know your way
back up to Nadia's room.

34:03.334 --> 34:06.417
This time, you don't have
to arrive in a body bag.

34:08.839 --> 34:10.921
Thank you, Lachlan.

34:11.008 --> 34:13.750
Thank you for making
all of this possible.

34:16.388 --> 34:19.300
Try to keep that in mind
in the days to come.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.387
Surprise!

35:06.605 --> 35:08.061
Wow.

35:18.409 --> 35:21.276
[cheering]

35:21.370 --> 35:22.234
Happy Birthday, Bo.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.115
Oh, thank you.

35:25.582 --> 35:26.332
[KENZI] Hi!

35:26.375 --> 35:28.991
--Hi.
--Happy birthday. Are you shocked?

35:29.086 --> 35:30.542
I'm totally shocked.

35:30.629 --> 35:35.498
There's someone I want you to meet.
Nate, this is Bo. Bo, this is Nate.

35:35.592 --> 35:37.457
Hey. Kenzi told me a lot about you.

35:37.553 --> 35:39.043
ReaHy?

35:39.138 --> 35:41.254
Yeah, she said that you were
the big sister she never had

35:41.348 --> 35:43.509
but always wished for.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.262
Yeah. Could you get the
birthday girl a drink?

35:46.353 --> 35:47.468
--Absolutely.
--Thank you.

35:47.563 --> 35:49.554
--Happy birthday.
--Thank you.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.229
Happy birthday, darlin'.

35:51.317 --> 35:53.308
Thank you. Thank you for all of this.

35:53.402 --> 35:54.232
It was nothing.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.776
He is cute.

35:57.489 --> 35:58.478
Happy birthday, Bo.

35:58.574 --> 36:00.030
Thank you.

36:01.785 --> 36:04.071
--Hey, you.
--Hey.

36:04.163 --> 36:05.152
Happy birthday.

36:05.247 --> 36:07.158
Dyson, you didn't have
to get me anything.

36:07.249 --> 36:09.410
Well, what are friends for, right?

36:14.965 --> 36:16.125
It's a knife.

36:16.216 --> 36:19.208
Well, I figured since your last one
is a pile of sand in Madagascar,

36:19.303 --> 36:20.543
you could use a replacement.

36:20.637 --> 36:24.880
Well, a girl can never have enough
sharp, pointy objects, can she?

36:24.975 --> 36:27.136
It's perfect. Thank you.

36:28.645 --> 36:32.763
Hey, you. Happy birthday.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.019
Hi.

36:35.110 --> 36:37.487
--Hey. I'm Dyson.
--Hi.

36:39.323 --> 36:41.063
--[HALE] Hi.
--Excuse me.

36:41.158 --> 36:43.274
l'm Hale. Nice to meet you.

36:43.369 --> 36:46.111
--[TR|CK] Hi. Trick. It's a pleasure.
--[NAD|A] Hi. Nadia.

36:46.205 --> 36:48.287
[CIARA] Hi. Glad you are here.

36:50.084 --> 36:51.790
Hi. Nadia.

36:53.087 --> 36:53.826
[LAUREN] Bo?

36:53.879 --> 36:58.669
Oh, hey. Wow, so Nadia's here.

36:58.759 --> 37:00.590
She's awake and ready to party.

37:00.677 --> 37:02.713
It's incredible. Five years
under the dome

37:02.805 --> 37:06.593
and she wakes up like it was
yesterday we were in Africa.

37:06.683 --> 37:08.674
If you hadn't gotten the
cursing nail from the Morrigan,

37:08.769 --> 37:10.600
we would never have
known the problem.

37:10.687 --> 37:13.303
Yeah.

37:13.399 --> 37:15.105
I got you something.

37:18.153 --> 37:19.768
You didn't have to.

37:27.871 --> 37:30.487
--Blades for my Cuisinart?
--They're Shurikens.

37:30.582 --> 37:33.289
Strange, I know, but what do you
get the woman who has everything?

37:33.377 --> 37:35.709
Well, steel death stars, of course.

37:38.549 --> 37:40.505
I worry about what you
get mixed up with.

37:40.592 --> 37:41.923
| just want to keep you safe.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.092
You don't have to worry about me.

37:44.179 --> 37:48.718
You've got other things
to occupy your mind now.

37:48.809 --> 37:50.140
I should get back.

37:50.227 --> 37:51.683
Thank you.

37:59.111 --> 38:00.226
Happy birthday, Bo.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.776
Wow.

38:03.824 --> 38:06.406
Oh, Trick, I am so sorry.

38:06.493 --> 38:09.155
--About what?
--The bracelet. It was destroyed.

38:09.246 --> 38:10.656
For a good cause, right?

38:10.747 --> 38:11.827
Yeah.

38:11.915 --> 38:15.328
That bracelet brought my wife
years and years of happiness

38:15.419 --> 38:17.626
and now it's bringing
happiness to others.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.087
Go ahead.

38:29.308 --> 38:31.014
lt's lovely.

38:31.101 --> 38:32.637
It's an antique walking stick.

38:32.728 --> 38:35.344
And not a comment on my age, I hope.

38:35.439 --> 38:39.307
Elegant and yet practical.

38:39.401 --> 38:42.939
Oh. It's a weapon.
And you had it monogrammed.

38:43.030 --> 38:44.770
A very long time ago.

38:44.865 --> 38:47.527
It was hers, your wife's?

38:47.618 --> 38:49.609
Now it's yours.

38:49.703 --> 38:51.568
Do me a favour and keep it close.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.119
You never know when
you might need it.

38:53.207 --> 38:56.449
--Thank you.
--Happy birthday.

38:56.543 --> 38:57.999
Thanks, Trick.

39:01.131 --> 39:03.247
I understand birthday
wishes are in order.

39:03.342 --> 39:06.960
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude,
but do I know you?

39:07.054 --> 39:08.510
From an admirer.

39:08.597 --> 39:09.677
An admirer?

39:09.765 --> 39:14.350
Enthusiast, devotee, a fancier.

39:14.436 --> 39:15.642
Thanks for clearing that up.

39:15.729 --> 39:17.515
Yeah. Happy to be of service.

39:22.945 --> 39:26.437
It's beautiful.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.944
--And it's not a weapon.
--Don't be so sure.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.070
l was told to pass on
the following message--

39:31.161 --> 39:33.197
read the inscription first.

39:37.960 --> 39:41.168
I can't really... What does it...?

40:04.987 --> 40:06.568
Happy birthday.

40:31.805 --> 40:34.012
Good morning, sunshine.

40:34.099 --> 40:39.765
I got you a java jolt. Double shot,
three shugs, just the way you like it.

40:39.855 --> 40:41.436
Get that sexy heart a-pumpin'.

40:41.523 --> 40:43.229
Thank you very much.

40:46.403 --> 40:48.314
And thank you again for last night.

40:48.405 --> 40:52.444
I mean, it was so thoughtful, Kenzi.
I especially like the cat decor.

40:52.534 --> 40:55.697
So, was yesterday jam-packed
with headline news or what?

40:55.787 --> 40:57.573
Yeah, it was fairly eventful.

40:57.664 --> 41:01.782
Says the blue ribbon award-winner
of this year's understatement award.

41:01.877 --> 41:06.120
You jetting off to Africa, which I
totally need the deets on, by the way.

41:06.214 --> 41:08.000
And Dyson and Ciara buying a mansion

41:08.091 --> 41:10.673
with walk-in closets bigger
than this whole place.

41:10.761 --> 41:13.093
And Lauren's lady love
finally awakening

41:13.180 --> 41:18.049
from the curse of the poison apple.

41:18.143 --> 41:21.852
And you. You reunited
with your childhood crush.

41:21.938 --> 41:23.929
And can we please
talk about mister tall,

41:24.024 --> 41:26.731
dark, and weapons-of-mass-
destruction handsome?

41:26.818 --> 41:28.319
Oh, yeah. Who was that guy?

41:28.403 --> 41:29.313
I assumed you knew him?

41:29.404 --> 41:31.315
No, I've never seen him before.

41:31.406 --> 41:33.943
Trés misterioso.

41:36.787 --> 41:39.824
Let me guess--a knife? Maybe a pistol?

41:39.915 --> 41:41.655
Dude, you wanted a weapon?

41:41.750 --> 41:43.365
I saw a pair of really
cool brass knuckles,

41:43.460 --> 41:46.372
but I thought they'd be
kind of impersonal.

41:46.463 --> 41:48.670
Well, you would be right.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.466
Open it.

41:58.350 --> 41:59.806
Oh, wow.

42:06.358 --> 42:08.019
This is amazing.

42:08.110 --> 42:11.648
Nate, talented lad.

42:11.738 --> 42:13.194
I'm happy for you.

42:13.281 --> 42:15.988
I want to be happy for you, too.

42:16.076 --> 42:17.532
I know.

42:22.666 --> 42:24.748
Oh, wow.

42:24.835 --> 42:26.291
Thank you.

42:32.551 --> 42:36.590
Ah, how's the patient?

42:36.680 --> 42:38.420
She's good.

42:38.515 --> 42:41.632
She checks out completely.

42:41.727 --> 42:42.762
lt's astonishing.

42:42.853 --> 42:45.014
No. It's Fae.

42:45.105 --> 42:47.596
I am extremely grateful to you.

42:57.659 --> 43:00.492
And | honour my promise.

43:00.579 --> 43:05.573
Nadia's life in exchange for
my recommitment to you.

43:05.667 --> 43:08.659
From now on...

43:08.754 --> 43:11.746
...the necklace...

43:11.840 --> 43:13.580
...stays on.

43:20.390 --> 43:21.971
Forever.
