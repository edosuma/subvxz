01:04.962 --> 01:06.623
<i>I don't have time.</i>

01:07.765 --> 01:10.598
<i>I don't have time to
worry about how it happened.</i>

01:11.135 --> 01:12.898
<i>It is what it is.</i>

01:13.771 --> 01:17.605
<i>We're genetically engineered
to stop aging at 25.</i>

01:18.442 --> 01:21.673
<i>The trouble is, we live only one more year</i>

01:22.446 --> 01:24.607
<i>unless we can get more time.</i>

01:27.451 --> 01:30.443
<i>Time is now the currency.</i>

01:31.522 --> 01:34.116
<i>We earn it and spend it.</i>

01:35.126 --> 01:37.458
<i>The rich can live forever.</i>

01:38.296 --> 01:39.695
<i>And the rest of us?</i>

01:41.198 --> 01:43.428
<i>I just want to wake up
with more time on my hand</i>

01:43.501 --> 01:45.196
<i>than hours in the day.</i>

02:16.734 --> 02:17.792
Hey, Mom.

02:18.602 --> 02:19.762
You got in late last night.

02:19.837 --> 02:21.429
I put in some overtime.

02:21.605 --> 02:22.731
Where'd it go?

02:23.274 --> 02:24.263
On you.

02:24.608 --> 02:27.304
They drink it in New Greenwich.
Happy 50th!

02:28.479 --> 02:29.468
Fifty?

02:29.947 --> 02:31.278
That's right.

02:32.016 --> 02:34.177
Twenty-five for the 25th time.

02:34.452 --> 02:37.182
Oh, I was sure I'd have a grandchild by now.

02:37.455 --> 02:38.444
Here we go.

02:38.522 --> 02:40.217
Bela's daughter is always asking about you.

02:40.291 --> 02:43.954
Who has time for a girlfriend?
Besides, what's the hurry?

02:44.528 --> 02:45.859
What do you got?

02:46.464 --> 02:48.523
Three days. Not even.

02:48.866 --> 02:50.197
We owe half that in rent.

02:50.267 --> 02:53.361
Eight for the electric and
we're still late on that loan.

02:53.471 --> 02:56.201
I can make extra on the side, you know.

02:57.141 --> 02:59.302
- I could...
- What, start fighting?

03:00.978 --> 03:01.967
Nobody wins.

03:02.680 --> 03:03.669
Yeah.

03:04.949 --> 03:06.177
Remember, I'm not here tonight.

03:06.250 --> 03:07.740
I got two days' work in the garment district.

03:07.985 --> 03:09.384
- I know.
- Meet me at the bus stop tomorrow.

03:09.487 --> 03:11.546
- After I pay off the loan, I won't have long.
- I'll be there.

03:12.890 --> 03:14.152
Will...

03:14.892 --> 03:17.884
I just wouldn't know what to do if I lost you.

03:17.995 --> 03:19.155
I'm late.

03:19.397 --> 03:21.991
Let me give you 30 minutes
so you can have a decent lunch.

03:36.914 --> 03:38.006
I love you.

03:39.417 --> 03:41.009
Happy birthday, Mom.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.148
When you get back,
we're going to celebrate.

03:54.532 --> 03:55.692
Will!

03:56.033 --> 03:57.022
Will!

03:58.035 --> 03:59.024
You got a minute?

03:59.203 --> 04:01.068
What are you talking about, Mya?
You have a whole year.

04:01.906 --> 04:03.271
Not a year I can use yet.

04:03.874 --> 04:06.104
Come on, Will. I've got bills to pay.

04:09.213 --> 04:11.408
Here, take five minutes.

04:16.120 --> 04:17.279
Get out of here.

04:32.069 --> 04:34.128
Four minutes for a cup of coffee?

04:34.205 --> 04:35.638
Yesterday, it was three.

04:35.739 --> 04:37.639
You want coffee or you want to reminisce?

04:37.908 --> 04:39.239
Two coffees.

04:42.313 --> 04:44.304
- How many shifts you got today, Borel?
- Just the two.

04:45.249 --> 04:47.080
Really excited about it.

04:49.086 --> 04:52.317
If you had any of your father in you,
we could make a fortune.

04:52.990 --> 04:54.423
I don't fight.

04:59.096 --> 05:01.496
There's another one. Broad daylight.

05:34.798 --> 05:37.426
Whoa, what is this? Where's the rest?

05:37.635 --> 05:38.659
Never met the quota.

05:38.736 --> 05:40.203
My units are up from last week.

05:40.371 --> 05:42.134
So's the quota. Next.

05:42.206 --> 05:43.332
That's a joke, right?

05:43.707 --> 05:45.834
- Next.
- Move it. You're taking forever.

06:04.228 --> 06:05.490
You in, Will?

06:05.563 --> 06:07.326
I don't have time to gamble anymore.

06:07.565 --> 06:09.055
Oh, thank God.

06:09.166 --> 06:12.158
Because ever since you stopped playing,
I started winning.

06:12.236 --> 06:13.396
You still owe me an hour.

06:16.173 --> 06:17.504
You seen Borel?

06:25.349 --> 06:27.180
- Will!
- Hey, man.

06:27.918 --> 06:28.907
Your wife's looking for you.

06:28.986 --> 06:30.010
You're not gonna believe it.

06:30.087 --> 06:33.887
This madman's been buying drinks all night.
He's got a century!

06:35.593 --> 06:37.254
Come on, let me get you home.

06:37.595 --> 06:39.529
Soon as I finish this drink.

06:40.197 --> 06:41.858
Hey! You!

06:42.333 --> 06:43.322
You!

06:44.435 --> 06:45.766
More everything!

06:48.706 --> 06:50.765
Do you want to come home with me?

06:50.874 --> 06:53.206
You can take us both home.

07:01.719 --> 07:02.947
Excuse me.

07:03.954 --> 07:05.717
You need to get out of here.

07:06.056 --> 07:07.546
Somebody's gonna clean that clock.

07:07.725 --> 07:08.783
Yes!

07:11.562 --> 07:14.531
I mean, they aren't going to rob you.
They are going to kill you.

07:15.466 --> 07:16.455
They can't take that much time

07:16.533 --> 07:17.966
and let you live to tell about it.

07:18.068 --> 07:19.057
Yes.

07:19.303 --> 07:22.466
I don't think you understand.
You should not be here!

07:29.713 --> 07:31.305
Will. Will!

07:32.750 --> 07:34.081
Minutemen!

07:34.318 --> 07:35.876
Minutemen! Walk away, Will.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.618
Those gangsters aren't playing around.

07:41.625 --> 07:42.956
Wait, wait.

07:43.427 --> 07:46.760
He's asking for it. Let's go.
He's not one of us.

07:47.498 --> 07:48.829
You think he'd help us?

07:49.833 --> 07:52.324
Don't worry. I won't do anything stupid.

07:52.936 --> 07:53.925
Go.

07:59.576 --> 08:01.134
The name's Fortis.

08:03.614 --> 08:07.106
And that, sir, is a very nice watch.

08:10.788 --> 08:14.280
Do you mind if I try it on?
I think it would suit me.

08:16.794 --> 08:18.193
I'll tell you what.

08:19.630 --> 08:21.291
I'll fight you for it.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.858
Come on.

08:25.202 --> 08:28.296
I'm an old man. Turned 75 last week.

08:37.715 --> 08:38.875
I need a moment.

08:54.998 --> 08:56.397
You ready to go?

08:58.569 --> 08:59.729
Ready to go.

09:03.674 --> 09:05.005
Let's get you out of here.

09:08.178 --> 09:09.509
Get him!

09:10.347 --> 09:13.680
Stop. What are you doing?
I can take care of myself.

09:13.751 --> 09:15.343
Yeah, it looked like it.

09:17.521 --> 09:18.647
I know what I'm doing.

09:18.722 --> 09:19.916
Run. Run!

09:33.036 --> 09:34.264
Come on!

09:35.372 --> 09:36.771
Here!

09:39.543 --> 09:40.601
Hurry!

09:45.716 --> 09:46.944
Move!

09:57.227 --> 09:59.559
Where the hell are you going? Get in here!

10:42.239 --> 10:44.070
I know who took him.

10:44.508 --> 10:46.339
I know who he is.

10:48.946 --> 10:50.436
Who he was.

10:57.988 --> 11:00.183
Damn it, damn it.

11:03.694 --> 11:05.855
What the hell are you doing here?

11:06.129 --> 11:07.790
Flashing all that?

11:07.998 --> 11:09.090
You out of your mind?

11:10.634 --> 11:11.692
Henry Hamilton.

11:15.138 --> 11:16.127
Will Salas.

11:24.882 --> 11:26.474
Ugh.

11:26.783 --> 11:27.772
God.

11:28.051 --> 11:29.712
Drink more, it gets better.

11:36.894 --> 11:38.122
Not much better.

11:44.001 --> 11:45.491
You'll be safe till morning.

11:45.836 --> 11:47.497
I'll get you out of here.

11:49.006 --> 11:50.405
You're from New Greenwich.

11:51.909 --> 11:53.342
Does it show?

11:54.344 --> 11:55.504
Nah.

12:02.352 --> 12:04.513
Looks like you could use some help yourself.

12:04.755 --> 12:06.086
No, thanks.

12:06.356 --> 12:07.914
How old are you?

12:08.759 --> 12:09.919
In real time?

12:10.694 --> 12:12.025
Twenty-eight.

12:12.529 --> 12:14.087
I'm 105.

12:14.364 --> 12:15.695
Good for you.

12:17.034 --> 12:20.197
You won't see 106, you have too many
more nights like tonight.

12:21.038 --> 12:22.369
You are right.

12:24.374 --> 12:26.365
But the day comes when you've had enough.

12:28.045 --> 12:31.037
Your mind can be spent,
even if your body's not.

12:33.884 --> 12:35.545
We want to die.

12:36.787 --> 12:38.015
We need to.

12:41.892 --> 12:45.726
That's your problem?
You've been alive too long?

12:49.132 --> 12:50.622
You ever known anyone who's died?

12:57.474 --> 13:00.136
For a few to be immortal, many must die.

13:05.749 --> 13:07.649
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

13:09.987 --> 13:11.978
You really don't know, do you?

13:14.424 --> 13:17.154
Everyone can't live forever.
Where would we put them?

13:20.597 --> 13:22.758
Why do you think there are Time Zones?

13:24.167 --> 13:26.294
Why do you think taxes and prices go up

13:26.370 --> 13:27.997
the same day in the ghetto?

13:30.007 --> 13:32.942
The cost of living keeps rising to
make sure people keep dying.

13:34.778 --> 13:36.507
How else could there be
men with a million years

13:36.580 --> 13:38.013
while most live day to day?

13:42.452 --> 13:44.181
But the truth is

13:45.522 --> 13:46.853
there's more than enough.

13:49.626 --> 13:52.288
No one has to die before their time.

13:59.870 --> 14:04.204
If you had as much time
as I have on that clock,

14:06.676 --> 14:08.268
what would you do with it?

14:12.149 --> 14:13.810
I'd stop watching it.

14:18.055 --> 14:19.818
I can tell you one thing.

14:20.323 --> 14:22.314
If I had all that time,

14:22.993 --> 14:25.393
I sure as hell wouldn't waste it.

14:33.670 --> 14:35.069
Get some rest.

14:39.076 --> 14:41.067
Don't worry. I won't take it in the night.

14:41.678 --> 14:43.578
And I won't take yours.

14:57.994 --> 14:59.052
It does get better.

17:02.919 --> 17:04.682
- Oh, hey, Will.
- Hey, Greta.

17:05.589 --> 17:06.749
Is Borel in?

17:06.990 --> 17:09.584
Yeah. Borel?

17:10.160 --> 17:11.319
Look at that.

17:11.661 --> 17:14.185
A shame we gotta wait 25 years.

17:14.263 --> 17:15.595
We could use that year right now.

17:16.766 --> 17:17.755
Borel?

17:20.670 --> 17:21.932
I'm here.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.337
You'd better get her inside, Greta.

17:34.951 --> 17:36.282
Look at this.

17:38.855 --> 17:40.186
Where did you get that?

17:41.458 --> 17:43.016
The guy at the bar.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.356
They were going to kill him.

17:46.129 --> 17:47.790
He gave it to me.

17:49.366 --> 17:51.357
He timed himself out
before I could stop him.

17:51.468 --> 17:53.868
No one gives anybody 100 years.

17:54.170 --> 17:56.502
He didn't just give me this.

17:56.573 --> 17:57.733
He gave me the truth about it.

17:57.807 --> 17:59.502
You can't let anyone see that.

18:00.143 --> 18:01.132
Hey.

18:01.311 --> 18:03.438
You know that time will get you killed.

18:09.653 --> 18:10.881
How long have we been friends?

18:12.122 --> 18:13.783
What, 10 years?

18:14.357 --> 18:15.449
Here.

18:21.965 --> 18:23.296
A decade.

18:25.969 --> 18:27.266
You've been like a brother.

18:29.572 --> 18:30.732
Where are you going?

18:31.708 --> 18:33.699
Where this won't look out of place.

18:35.312 --> 18:37.837
I finally got the time to take my mom
to New Greenwich.

18:56.232 --> 18:57.995
Greta, I'm going out!

18:58.835 --> 19:01.463
<i>Loan payment received,
two days. Thank you.</i>

19:10.246 --> 19:11.235
Dayton.

19:11.748 --> 19:12.806
Two hours.

19:16.553 --> 19:17.747
It's always been an hour.

19:18.421 --> 19:20.184
Now it's two. Price went up.

19:20.256 --> 19:21.245
Since when?

19:21.758 --> 19:22.918
Since today.

19:24.260 --> 19:26.251
My son is meeting me.
He'll pay the difference.

19:26.363 --> 19:28.228
I can't do that, policy.

19:30.033 --> 19:31.227
Please?

19:32.602 --> 19:34.433
It's a two-hour walk.

19:38.041 --> 19:39.770
I have an hour and a half.

19:42.879 --> 19:44.210
Then you'd better run.

20:17.247 --> 20:20.410
Stop! Please stop!

20:52.449 --> 20:55.941
Wait! Please! Please, no!

20:56.953 --> 20:59.012
Wait! No! Please!

21:20.643 --> 21:21.803
Mom?

21:21.878 --> 21:22.867
Will!

21:27.484 --> 21:28.815
Will!

21:29.552 --> 21:31.486
- Will!
- Mom!

21:44.567 --> 21:46.558
No, no, no, no!

21:59.249 --> 22:00.341
No!

22:00.750 --> 22:02.843
Mom, Mom, Mom!

22:29.012 --> 22:30.138
Thirteen zeros.

22:30.713 --> 22:32.203
Unlucky for all.

22:33.550 --> 22:35.347
The last time anyone saw him alive,

22:35.418 --> 22:37.613
there was over a century on that clock.

22:38.621 --> 22:40.612
Around here, they'd kill you for a week.

22:40.723 --> 22:42.520
What was he doing in this Time Zone?

22:44.727 --> 22:45.887
What I was thinking

22:47.297 --> 22:49.629
was he might have brought this on himself.

22:49.732 --> 22:52.292
Interesting. How long
you been keeping time, Jaeger?

22:52.569 --> 22:53.661
Five years.

22:54.437 --> 22:56.598
Let me know what you think
when you have been doing it for 50.

22:57.707 --> 22:59.174
It doesn't matter why he came here.

22:59.242 --> 23:02.700
What matters are the hundred years
that came with him.

23:05.448 --> 23:07.109
Gotta be a witness.

23:07.450 --> 23:09.213
Trust me, no one saw anything.

23:09.285 --> 23:10.582
What would you like us to do, sir?

23:12.121 --> 23:14.954
What we always do. Follow the time.

23:18.728 --> 23:21.891
Hey, Ray. I'll give you 10 minutes
for an hour.

23:21.965 --> 23:23.626
When are you gonna
get out of the game, Leila?

23:23.700 --> 23:24.894
You gotta be pushing 60.

23:25.068 --> 23:26.899
Thanks for letting everyone know.

23:38.348 --> 23:39.372
<i>Am I in the right place?</i>

24:03.272 --> 24:06.435
We don't normally make
pickups in this Zone.

24:07.777 --> 24:09.438
I was lost.

24:15.685 --> 24:17.346
<i>Please deposit
one month.</i>

24:42.311 --> 24:44.973
<i>Please deposit two months.</i>

24:53.322 --> 24:55.313
There are more of these than I remember.

25:07.136 --> 25:08.626
That was a year.

25:09.172 --> 25:11.003
Welcome to New Greenwich.

25:13.676 --> 25:15.507
What are you really doing here?

25:17.513 --> 25:20.004
I'm going to take them
for everything they've got.

25:24.587 --> 25:26.350
I'm going to make them pay.

26:29.418 --> 26:31.579
Please, miss. You can't be too careful.

26:31.654 --> 26:33.349
Are you sure?

26:36.425 --> 26:37.687
What's a night here cost?

26:37.760 --> 26:39.728
Two months for a standard room.

26:43.499 --> 26:44.591
Give me a suite.

26:56.112 --> 26:57.170
Do you need help with your bags?

26:58.181 --> 26:59.341
No.

27:10.793 --> 27:13.284
- He's fast.
- He's going to have to be.

27:13.963 --> 27:16.796
The camera doesn't show us
how the body got into the river.

27:16.866 --> 27:18.629
What do we really know?

27:18.734 --> 27:20.793
What do we know?

27:20.870 --> 27:24.306
We know that most thefts in Dayton
amount to hours or days.

27:24.874 --> 27:26.637
This was a century.

27:27.977 --> 27:30.036
I don't see any more in circulation.

27:31.013 --> 27:32.344
He could have capsuled the time.

27:32.648 --> 27:35.048
You can't hide a hundred years
in the ghetto.

27:35.318 --> 27:38.310
They can sense when a man has
a month more than he should.

27:41.057 --> 27:42.649
The time left town.

28:28.037 --> 28:30.267
That'll be eight and a half weeks.

28:32.541 --> 28:34.031
Take a week for yourself.

28:34.710 --> 28:35.870
Thanks.

28:41.117 --> 28:44.780
You're not from around here, are you?

28:46.622 --> 28:48.886
You do everything a little too fast.

28:50.059 --> 28:51.083
Not everything.

28:53.062 --> 28:54.393
What's that place across the street?

28:55.464 --> 28:56.624
The casino.

28:56.899 --> 28:58.560
Can anybody go?

29:00.136 --> 29:01.228
Not dressed like that.

29:02.571 --> 29:03.902
Good luck.

29:10.579 --> 29:12.638
Sir, you were right.

29:12.748 --> 29:15.273
If you turn back the clocks
the day of Hamilton's death,

29:15.351 --> 29:16.477
and look at the time checks,

29:16.552 --> 29:19.521
someone spent years crossing
four different Time Zones from Dayton...

29:19.588 --> 29:23.922
To New Greenwich. The cameras picked up
on his suspicious behavior.

29:23.993 --> 29:26.154
He's conscious of the surveillance,

29:26.228 --> 29:28.992
he doesn't have a bodyguard, and he runs.

29:29.265 --> 29:31.597
But if he has time, he doesn't need to run.

29:31.834 --> 29:33.768
It's a hard habit to break.

29:35.504 --> 29:37.165
You're looking for a match?

29:37.840 --> 29:39.933
His name is Will Salas.

29:40.509 --> 29:41.840
You know him?

29:42.778 --> 29:43.938
No.

29:45.448 --> 29:46.847
I remember his father.

29:54.623 --> 29:55.954
Good evening.

29:58.160 --> 30:00.025
I assume my time is as good as anyone's.

30:00.129 --> 30:04.691
Indeed it is. However,
there is a voluntary donation

30:04.800 --> 30:07.462
for non-members. Most give a year.

30:15.311 --> 30:16.642
What's your game?

30:16.979 --> 30:18.003
Poker.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.308
Right this way.

30:21.717 --> 30:23.207
What's the limit?

30:23.986 --> 30:25.317
There is none.

30:39.402 --> 30:42.235
I don't believe we've had the pleasure
of your company before, Mr...

30:42.304 --> 30:43.737
Salas.

30:43.906 --> 30:44.998
Will Salas.

30:45.674 --> 30:49.405
Philippe Weis. You must come from time.

30:52.581 --> 30:54.640
You could say I'm gambling my inheritance.

30:54.717 --> 30:57.208
You don't have a guard, Mr. Salas?

31:00.423 --> 31:02.584
I assumed I was amongst friends.

31:09.598 --> 31:10.758
Bet you 50 years.

31:19.208 --> 31:20.698
You must be young.

31:21.544 --> 31:24.604
When you've been 25 for 85 years,
like I have,

31:24.713 --> 31:27.944
knowing only a random act of violence
can take your life,

31:28.451 --> 31:30.282
you learn to appreciate what you have.

31:31.387 --> 31:33.218
And you seem to have a lot to appreciate.

31:36.725 --> 31:37.953
I call.

31:54.410 --> 31:58.574
Of course,
some think what we have is unfair.

31:59.315 --> 32:00.907
The time difference between Zones.

32:01.250 --> 32:02.581
I've heard that.

32:03.752 --> 32:06.243
But isn't this just the next logical step
in our evolution?

32:06.388 --> 32:09.255
And hasn't evolution always been unfair?

32:09.325 --> 32:10.952
It's always been survival of the fittest.

32:13.329 --> 32:15.593
Raise you another two centuries.

32:18.501 --> 32:21.493
This is merely Darwinian capitalism.

32:23.339 --> 32:24.499
Natural selection.

32:25.274 --> 32:26.605
Absolutely.

32:27.343 --> 32:29.004
The strong survive.

32:30.112 --> 32:32.103
And I think your hand is weak.

32:33.449 --> 32:34.780
I call.

32:50.032 --> 32:52.364
It appears you're all in, Mr. Salas.

33:23.065 --> 33:24.623
Thirteen figures.

33:26.068 --> 33:27.399
Well played.

33:29.004 --> 33:30.835
That was some risk.

33:35.377 --> 33:36.708
It wasn't a risk.

33:37.012 --> 33:40.345
No offense. I knew I was going to win.

33:42.518 --> 33:43.917
Confusing times.

33:45.688 --> 33:48.020
Is she my mother, my sister
or my daughter?

33:48.157 --> 33:50.057
You're hoping she's not my wife.

33:51.360 --> 33:54.693
Things used to be simpler once. So I'm told.

33:56.532 --> 33:57.692
Very beautiful.

33:59.435 --> 34:00.424
Daughter.

34:00.869 --> 34:04.532
Though she does look
a lot like my wife. Sylvia?

34:05.441 --> 34:06.840
Will Salas.

34:06.909 --> 34:08.376
Congratulations, Mr. Salas.

34:10.112 --> 34:12.103
You've taken years off my father's life.

34:12.214 --> 34:15.614
Which is normally what you do.
Isn't that right, my darling?

34:17.219 --> 34:19.210
We're having a party tomorrow night.

34:19.788 --> 34:23.121
Perhaps you'll give him a chance to
win back some of those years.

34:24.426 --> 34:25.552
I'd love to.

34:25.628 --> 34:27.322
Carl will tell you where I am.

34:27.396 --> 34:28.726
Good night, Mr. Salas.

34:29.231 --> 34:31.391
Sylvia, stay with your guards.

34:46.081 --> 34:47.911
Fifty-nine years.

34:48.150 --> 34:49.275
Plus tax.

35:01.163 --> 35:02.323
The price includes delivery.

35:03.265 --> 35:04.323
Delivery?

35:04.933 --> 35:06.924
To wherever you're going to display it.

35:08.604 --> 35:09.764
Display it?

35:10.005 --> 35:11.836
Hell, I'm going to drive it.

35:31.827 --> 35:32.816
Will Salas.

35:34.797 --> 35:37.129
Allow me to introduce
my mother-in-law, Clara,

35:37.866 --> 35:41.131
my wife, Michele, and my daughter, Sylvia.

35:41.303 --> 35:43.032
I believe you two have already met.

35:45.307 --> 35:46.797
Nice to meet you all.

35:46.942 --> 35:48.432
I'll come find you later

35:49.011 --> 35:50.205
for our game.

35:50.879 --> 35:52.471
I look forward to it.

36:07.730 --> 36:09.721
Having fun, Mr. Salas?

36:12.334 --> 36:13.665
Please, call me Will.

36:14.837 --> 36:16.668
It's okay, Constantin.

36:19.508 --> 36:22.500
Do you always have a hired hand
standing right next to you?

36:22.578 --> 36:24.068
No. I usually have two.

36:26.682 --> 36:28.741
That doesn't make it very easy
to get to know you.

36:28.917 --> 36:30.578
I think that's the idea.

36:30.853 --> 36:32.343
Your idea?

36:32.421 --> 36:33.479
My father's.

36:33.555 --> 36:34.681
I understand.

36:35.691 --> 36:37.682
You all have a lot to lose.

36:38.527 --> 36:40.017
So do you.

36:43.031 --> 36:44.692
What do you do, Will?

36:45.367 --> 36:47.358
I haven't quite figured that out yet.

36:48.370 --> 36:51.862
Yes, why bother? What's the hurry?

36:52.941 --> 36:56.274
Right. Why do today what
you can do in a century?

36:57.279 --> 36:58.610
I know one thing we can do.

37:01.650 --> 37:03.277
Dance with me.

37:09.825 --> 37:11.884
Do you really come from time?

37:12.995 --> 37:14.656
Why would you doubt that?

37:17.232 --> 37:18.824
I saw you run.

37:19.835 --> 37:22.326
Reminds me of people
who come from the ghetto.

37:25.507 --> 37:27.498
Sometimes I envy them.

37:30.679 --> 37:32.340
You don't know anything.

37:33.682 --> 37:37.174
Oh, no? The clock is good for no one.

37:39.855 --> 37:42.187
The poor die and the rich don't live.

37:42.591 --> 37:45.924
We can all live forever as long as
we don't do anything foolish.

37:46.695 --> 37:51.359
Doesn't that scare you? That maybe
you'll never do anything foolish?

37:51.700 --> 37:55.363
Or courageous or anything worth a damn?

38:01.210 --> 38:02.370
Come with me.

38:17.459 --> 38:19.120
This was tonight.

38:21.797 --> 38:23.890
He's only an hour ahead of us.

38:31.073 --> 38:32.563
Look at that.

38:33.742 --> 38:35.573
I've never seen anything like it.

38:39.047 --> 38:40.378
What are you doing?

38:42.251 --> 38:43.479
We don't go in.

38:46.255 --> 38:47.813
You're insane.

38:48.257 --> 38:51.420
You have this in your backyard.
You never go in.

38:52.928 --> 38:54.259
And I'm insane?

38:59.268 --> 39:02.260
Well? What are you waiting for?

39:04.006 --> 39:05.667
Sylvia, come on!

39:06.441 --> 39:08.932
What happened to doing something foolish?

39:30.699 --> 39:32.530
I don't know you.

39:34.469 --> 39:36.027
We could change that.

39:38.974 --> 39:40.305
I get it.

39:41.443 --> 39:44.276
You're out here, all alone,

39:44.813 --> 39:46.474
with a stranger.

39:47.916 --> 39:49.577
You can't be too careful.

39:50.886 --> 39:51.978
Maybe you can.

39:53.488 --> 39:54.648
Sylvia!

39:56.992 --> 39:58.152
Sylvia!

40:08.337 --> 40:10.168
I have to go back.

40:11.239 --> 40:12.570
To what?

40:18.747 --> 40:20.408
You should go back.

40:32.361 --> 40:34.761
- Have you seen my daughter?
- I have.

40:36.231 --> 40:37.220
She's with her guards.

40:39.201 --> 40:40.532
Right behind you.

40:43.372 --> 40:44.703
Thank God.

40:45.440 --> 40:46.600
Now,

40:47.109 --> 40:48.201
how about that game?

40:57.285 --> 40:59.947
It's all right, everyone. What's this about?

41:02.391 --> 41:04.450
I'm sorry to have to
break up the party, Mr. Weis.

41:05.894 --> 41:07.293
I just need a word with your friend.

41:09.731 --> 41:11.062
My friend?

41:12.300 --> 41:13.631
Very well.

41:40.996 --> 41:42.930
I'm Timekeeper Raymond Leon.

41:47.035 --> 41:48.024
I'm Will Salas.

41:48.103 --> 41:49.434
I know.

41:53.008 --> 41:54.339
What are you doing in this Zone?

41:55.444 --> 41:57.935
It's not illegal, is it? To change Time Zones?

41:58.613 --> 42:00.444
No, it's not illegal.

42:01.616 --> 42:03.777
It's just rare.

42:08.857 --> 42:09.949
Where did you get that?

42:10.192 --> 42:11.352
I won it.

42:12.360 --> 42:13.691
Gambling.

42:17.132 --> 42:18.292
All of it?

42:23.805 --> 42:24.863
No.

42:25.974 --> 42:28.465
A man named Henry Hamilton
gave me over a century.

42:31.880 --> 42:33.814
He said he didn't need it anymore.

42:35.550 --> 42:37.142
He timed himself out.

42:37.886 --> 42:40.821
Henry Hamilton was
worth thousands of years.

42:41.490 --> 42:43.549
He could practically live forever.

42:45.160 --> 42:50.120
You expect me to believe that
he was immortal and he wanted to die?

42:50.832 --> 42:52.823
I don't expect you to believe it.

42:54.236 --> 42:55.396
But it's the truth.

42:57.539 --> 42:58.870
It was a gift.

42:59.674 --> 43:00.902
I'm not a thief.

43:03.011 --> 43:06.003
But, hey, if you guys
are looking for stolen time,

43:07.582 --> 43:09.174
maybe you should arrest everyone here.

43:09.417 --> 43:10.509
Oh, I see.

43:11.586 --> 43:13.019
You're talking about justice.

43:14.756 --> 43:16.917
Well, I am a Timekeeper.

43:17.359 --> 43:20.021
I don't concern myself with "justice."

43:20.529 --> 43:23.692
I only concern myself
with what I can measure.

43:24.199 --> 43:26.690
Seconds, minutes, hours.

43:29.204 --> 43:30.262
I keep time.

43:32.107 --> 43:34.598
And that time is in the wrong hands.

43:37.212 --> 43:40.545
That time will be held, along with you.

43:43.952 --> 43:46.443
We'll leave you two hours
for booking and processing.

43:50.125 --> 43:52.059
Why are you investigating a suicide?

43:54.563 --> 43:56.360
There's mass murder
in the ghetto every day.

44:03.471 --> 44:04.961
That is fascinating.

44:06.374 --> 44:07.363
Huh.

44:09.077 --> 44:11.307
I heard another man talk like that.

44:12.747 --> 44:14.738
It was over 20 years ago.

44:17.652 --> 44:20.314
You're probably too young
to remember your father.

44:21.923 --> 44:23.914
We'll arrange safe transport.

44:24.759 --> 44:26.818
This is New Greenwich, after all.

44:31.666 --> 44:34.294
Sylvia? Do as I say and go with the guards.

44:34.436 --> 44:37.098
Oh, for God's sake, Father.
There's an army in this house.

44:37.439 --> 44:41.500
If we can't stop one man from killing us,
we should kill ourselves.

45:03.598 --> 45:04.929
Stop him!

45:07.702 --> 45:10.466
Move! Get out of the way!

45:15.310 --> 45:17.369
Put it down or I'll blow her head off.

45:18.880 --> 45:20.142
Thanks.

45:59.354 --> 46:01.914
You're going to kill us!
Please just let me out!

46:27.682 --> 46:28.740
What are you doing?

46:31.186 --> 46:32.676
Do you even know how to drive?

46:33.455 --> 46:34.945
What's there to know?

46:49.304 --> 46:50.566
Oh, shit.

47:27.175 --> 47:28.608
Give me some time.

47:31.179 --> 47:33.113
I guess you really are
from the ghetto, after all.

47:33.681 --> 47:36.775
What the hell do you know about
where I'm from? Give me some time.

47:37.185 --> 47:39.517
Or you're gonna kill me,
like you killed Henry Hamilton?

47:39.988 --> 47:41.319
Lend me an hour.

47:41.856 --> 47:42.914
I'm not giving you a second.

47:45.527 --> 47:46.994
I should have listened to my father.

47:49.464 --> 47:51.955
Please, take me home. Please.

47:52.534 --> 47:53.967
- I can't do that.
- Why?

47:54.302 --> 47:55.633
You're keeping me alive.

47:57.872 --> 47:59.203
Keep that covered.

47:59.841 --> 48:02.173
Anybody sees it, you're definitely dead.

48:36.478 --> 48:38.309
Now that worked too well.

48:38.379 --> 48:40.643
You guys wasted a gorgeous car.

48:40.982 --> 48:42.472
Look who it is.

48:42.717 --> 48:44.150
Who it was.

48:47.388 --> 48:48.719
He's done in minutes.

48:48.990 --> 48:52.050
He'll wake up dead. That'll be a shock.

48:52.560 --> 48:55.893
Too bad. I would have preferred to
kill him more beautifully.

48:56.164 --> 48:57.722
The girl's still breathing.

48:58.500 --> 48:59.489
She's got a decade.

49:00.835 --> 49:02.166
Holy shit.

49:02.370 --> 49:05.032
The man he stole from me
had more than a century.

49:10.011 --> 49:12.241
What? We'll divide it later.

49:12.680 --> 49:14.511
It's like an angel fell from the sky.

49:19.521 --> 49:20.681
Fortis!

49:20.755 --> 49:21.949
Leave it!

49:22.257 --> 49:23.349
Fortis!

49:50.051 --> 49:51.382
Look at me.

49:51.619 --> 49:52.950
You okay?

49:53.388 --> 49:54.548
No.

49:57.058 --> 49:58.116
Why are you laughing?

49:59.627 --> 50:00.651
We're not dead.

50:00.762 --> 50:02.252
Yeah, we're not alive for long, either.

50:02.964 --> 50:05.626
Where did my time go? I have a half hour!

50:06.100 --> 50:07.158
Ah.

50:07.235 --> 50:08.634
You're lucky.

50:09.404 --> 50:11.804
- Minutemen.
- Does everyone in the ghetto steal?

50:11.906 --> 50:13.134
That's rich, coming from you.

50:14.309 --> 50:16.004
- Please help me, Will.
- Let me guess,

50:16.110 --> 50:18.305
now you like the idea of sharing.

50:20.481 --> 50:21.641
Come here.

50:24.319 --> 50:26.913
Hey, don't worry.
It's not the first time I've been this broke.

50:27.155 --> 50:28.918
Well, it's a first for me.

50:30.325 --> 50:31.986
What are we going to do?

50:32.260 --> 50:35.252
Whatever we have to.
Come on, we got to go.

50:55.283 --> 50:57.649
Dispatch, wire me my per diem.

50:57.986 --> 50:59.817
<i>Time transfer.</i>

51:04.359 --> 51:06.293
Cutting it close again, sir.

51:06.628 --> 51:08.789
Well, I'm still walking around.

51:09.530 --> 51:10.963
Judging by the lack of dead bodies,

51:11.032 --> 51:13.466
I have to assume they are also.

51:18.139 --> 51:21.802
They got jacked. They couldn't have
left here with more than minutes.

51:22.043 --> 51:24.136
He's back in his old neighborhood.

51:25.546 --> 51:27.707
So, where do you want us to start looking?

51:29.317 --> 51:32.548
We don't. He'll come to us.

51:53.174 --> 51:54.436
Borel?

51:57.512 --> 51:59.503
Borel, open up. It's Will.

52:01.683 --> 52:02.843
Greta.

52:04.686 --> 52:05.880
Where's Borel?

52:06.854 --> 52:08.515
He's dead.

52:09.524 --> 52:11.856
Dead? What?

52:12.093 --> 52:13.287
You gave him a decade.

52:14.762 --> 52:17.390
He drank himself to death
with nine years on his clock.

52:17.465 --> 52:18.796
Jesus Christ.

52:21.803 --> 52:23.270
Greta, I'm so sorry.

52:24.472 --> 52:25.962
Goodbye, Will.

52:34.082 --> 52:35.106
Will, we have minutes.

52:35.183 --> 52:36.241
Try not to act like it.

52:36.317 --> 52:38.182
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Shut up!

52:38.286 --> 52:39.913
We're going to die, Will!
Do you want to die?

52:39.987 --> 52:41.318
Shut up!

52:47.161 --> 52:49.595
I hope those are real. Run.

53:01.442 --> 53:02.500
Stop! Wait!

53:02.610 --> 53:03.702
Please, wait!

53:05.847 --> 53:07.337
Come back in an hour.

53:07.448 --> 53:08.938
That won't be possible.

53:11.552 --> 53:12.712
Here!

53:27.535 --> 53:28.661
I'll give you two days for them.

53:29.137 --> 53:30.229
They're diamonds.

53:30.471 --> 53:32.701
You can take the 48 hours,
or you can be a pretty corpse.

53:33.307 --> 53:34.467
We'll take it.

53:45.486 --> 53:46.851
Don't make a sound.

53:46.921 --> 53:48.252
Give me my time.

53:55.096 --> 53:56.085
Let's go.

53:57.865 --> 53:59.696
I guess I got my wish.

53:59.767 --> 54:01.894
I did do something foolish.

54:04.705 --> 54:06.536
Your name's on a lot of buildings.

54:06.607 --> 54:08.199
It's my father's name.

54:08.376 --> 54:10.435
How much is he worth, anyway?

54:11.712 --> 54:13.043
Eons.

54:13.448 --> 54:15.382
What do you think he'd pay to get you back?

54:15.616 --> 54:17.880
You have no shame, do you?

54:21.889 --> 54:24.221
<i>Please deposit one minute.</i>

54:26.394 --> 54:27.452
Dial.

54:41.909 --> 54:42.898
Hello.

54:42.977 --> 54:45.912
Mr. Weis, please give the phone
to the Timekeeper.

54:51.752 --> 54:54.744
Hello, Will. How much do you want?

54:55.590 --> 54:56.648
A thousand years.

54:57.825 --> 54:59.156
You'll never live to spend it.

55:04.265 --> 55:06.426
Then distribute it
to the Time Lines in Dayton.

55:07.935 --> 55:10.267
Do it by sunrise tomorrow
and she can go home.

55:13.074 --> 55:14.234
Will...

55:15.776 --> 55:17.607
I'm afraid for you, Will.

55:17.945 --> 55:21.142
You keep talking like him,
you're going to die like him.

55:21.349 --> 55:24.841
My father died in a fight,
trying to take a man's time.

55:24.952 --> 55:28.115
Oh, no. His crime wasn't taking time.

55:29.357 --> 55:31.621
<i>He was doing something
far more dangerous.</i>

55:33.528 --> 55:35.359
Please don't make your father's mistake.

55:41.802 --> 55:43.531
Dayton. Pedre Plaza.

55:43.871 --> 55:45.202
I know it.

55:46.474 --> 55:49.307
A thousand years to the Time Lines.

55:49.544 --> 55:50.977
A thousand years.

55:53.548 --> 55:55.038
It's nothing.

55:55.316 --> 55:57.147
It's for our daughter.

55:58.886 --> 56:00.717
No, it's for them.

56:01.256 --> 56:02.746
This is insane.

56:02.824 --> 56:05.019
They can take your time, just like that.

56:06.194 --> 56:07.855
Or you can take theirs.

56:08.196 --> 56:09.686
This is insane.

56:10.365 --> 56:12.697
Yeah, it's insane.

56:26.714 --> 56:28.705
We should be safe here until dawn.

56:30.118 --> 56:32.882
I pay by the day.
It'll take them a while to find me.

56:38.459 --> 56:39.756
This is your place?

56:43.564 --> 56:46.294
There's water. It's cold, but it's something.

56:47.568 --> 56:49.729
You can put on fresh clothes.

57:20.935 --> 57:22.129
Where's your family?

57:24.172 --> 57:25.935
My mother timed out.

57:29.110 --> 57:30.168
This is her dress.

57:30.445 --> 57:31.605
Yeah.

57:35.183 --> 57:36.616
What about your father?

57:38.152 --> 57:39.483
He died when I was a boy.

57:40.621 --> 57:42.953
He was a fighter. Strong arm.

57:45.026 --> 57:48.792
He wasn't the strongest,
but he knew how to win.

57:50.465 --> 57:51.796
How do you win?

57:59.974 --> 58:01.305
I'll show you.

58:06.147 --> 58:09.480
What you do is let them
have the upper hand.

58:09.817 --> 58:13.309
Then, he'd let his time go all the way down.

58:14.722 --> 58:16.155
Because he knew

58:16.824 --> 58:18.883
that when you were
down to your last seconds

58:19.660 --> 58:21.491
and they think it's over,

58:22.997 --> 58:25.329
they start watching your clock

58:29.070 --> 58:30.401
and forget to watch their own.

58:46.754 --> 58:48.415
He died in a fight?

58:51.692 --> 58:55.924
I think he was killed
for giving away what he won.

58:56.030 --> 58:58.191
He wasn't just giving them time.

58:59.033 --> 59:00.398
He was giving them hope.

59:05.706 --> 59:07.173
How long have you been this old?

59:07.875 --> 59:09.240
Twenty-five for three.

59:11.379 --> 59:13.040
Twenty-five for two.

59:15.750 --> 59:17.741
What was it like when your clock started?

59:21.556 --> 59:22.989
<i>I was in the street.</i>

59:23.057 --> 59:25.048
<i>It almost knocked me over.</i>

59:25.726 --> 59:28.286
<i>My year was gone in a week,
we were so in debt.</i>

59:28.729 --> 59:31.562
After that, I lived day to day.

59:33.468 --> 59:35.402
Mine was a little different.

59:37.238 --> 59:38.569
It woke me.

59:51.252 --> 59:52.913
<i>I looked in the mirror.</i>

59:54.422 --> 59:56.413
<i>I guess everybody does.</i>

59:58.493 --> 01:00:00.984
<i>That's what you're gonna look like
for the rest of your life.</i>

01:00:02.597 --> 01:00:04.656
My dad gave me a decade to celebrate.

01:00:06.934 --> 01:00:08.162
You must hate me.

01:00:10.271 --> 01:00:11.761
Where I come from.

01:00:12.607 --> 01:00:15.098
It's nobody's fault, what they're born with.

01:00:36.531 --> 01:00:38.192
They open in a minute.

01:00:39.867 --> 01:00:42.028
Let's see how generous your father is now.

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.561
The Timekeepers would
have never let him do it.

01:01:14.835 --> 01:01:16.393
You don't have to say that.

01:01:17.505 --> 01:01:20.338
How do you think my father
built all those buildings?

01:01:20.841 --> 01:01:23.173
By giving away a thousand years?

01:01:27.515 --> 01:01:28.846
Now what?

01:01:30.685 --> 01:01:32.084
You can go home.

01:01:34.188 --> 01:01:35.883
There's people on the streets.

01:01:35.957 --> 01:01:37.185
I can move without being spotted.

01:01:38.259 --> 01:01:39.351
What have you got?

01:01:42.263 --> 01:01:43.594
Eleven hours.

01:01:45.666 --> 01:01:47.531
How does anyone live like this?

01:01:47.602 --> 01:01:49.194
You don't generally sleep in.

01:01:57.278 --> 01:01:58.870
You can call for help.

01:01:59.547 --> 01:02:01.014
I'll watch from here,
I'll make sure you're safe.

01:02:01.082 --> 01:02:02.811
You know, you could fight this.

01:02:03.918 --> 01:02:05.783
I can say that running to
the ghetto was my idea.

01:02:07.121 --> 01:02:08.748
My father'd believe that,
he thinks I'm reckless.

01:02:10.424 --> 01:02:11.891
He has a lot of influence, Will.

01:02:11.959 --> 01:02:13.449
He can get you a lawyer.

01:02:13.561 --> 01:02:15.358
He can make a deal with those Timekeepers.

01:02:15.963 --> 01:02:17.931
I'm pretty sure
that Timekeeper doesn't make deals.

01:02:21.936 --> 01:02:23.767
What are you going to do?

01:02:23.938 --> 01:02:25.269
Steal?

01:02:27.441 --> 01:02:29.534
Is it stealing if it's already stolen?

01:02:32.546 --> 01:02:34.878
Here. Just in case.

01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:37.508
I'll be right here.

01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:10.748
<i>Please deposit
one minute.</i>

01:03:15.923 --> 01:03:17.584
<i>- Father?
- Sylvia?</i>

01:03:17.825 --> 01:03:19.986
You couldn't spare a second, Father?

01:03:20.661 --> 01:03:21.992
I wish I could say I'm surprised.

01:03:27.935 --> 01:03:28.959
Did you hear what I just said?

01:03:29.036 --> 01:03:30.264
<i>You know I'd do anything for you.</i>

01:03:31.839 --> 01:03:32.931
They're coming to get you.

01:03:33.174 --> 01:03:34.835
<i>They know where you are.</i>

01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:36.235
Will, look out!

01:03:54.962 --> 01:03:57.089
Sorry to disappoint you,
we don't keep much on us.

01:03:58.299 --> 01:04:00.790
To discourage thieves like you.

01:04:06.207 --> 01:04:07.367
Think of this as a gift.

01:04:09.477 --> 01:04:10.637
Will! Come on!

01:04:33.067 --> 01:04:35.058
I didn't mean to shoot him.
I wanted to scare him.

01:04:35.169 --> 01:04:36.796
I think you did both.

01:04:37.505 --> 01:04:38.995
You could say thank you.

01:04:39.073 --> 01:04:41.405
Thank you. What have you got?

01:04:42.676 --> 01:04:44.075
Nine hours.

01:04:44.845 --> 01:04:47.837
Why did you give him time?
You should have taken it.

01:04:49.850 --> 01:04:52.182
Timekeepers live day to day.

01:04:53.754 --> 01:04:56.416
It'll be hours before the others show up.

01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:58.817
He could die in the ghetto.

01:04:58.893 --> 01:05:00.190
He still might.

01:05:00.694 --> 01:05:02.685
Timekeeper, what's the hurry?

01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:06.923
Stay a while.
You might like us if you got to know us!

01:05:10.771 --> 01:05:12.295
They're going to think you're with me.

01:05:12.373 --> 01:05:13.772
Yes.

01:05:15.943 --> 01:05:17.706
This is a mess.

01:05:18.112 --> 01:05:19.545
Welcome to my world.

01:05:23.551 --> 01:05:24.882
Back off!

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.450
You've been shot.
I was worried you timed out.

01:05:30.958 --> 01:05:32.289
Where'd you get that?

01:05:44.939 --> 01:05:46.531
What are we going to do?

01:05:46.607 --> 01:05:48.666
We can't keep driving around in this car.

01:05:48.742 --> 01:05:49.936
It's a cop car.

01:05:51.478 --> 01:05:52.706
So let's make an arrest.

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:14.499
Was I going too fast?

01:06:15.502 --> 01:06:17.265
Not fast enough.

01:06:17.671 --> 01:06:19.798
The mistake you made was stopping.

01:06:21.275 --> 01:06:24.267
Now, let's see who you got back there.

01:06:27.114 --> 01:06:29.412
Got to be a year or two nobody's using.

01:06:30.885 --> 01:06:31.874
Whoa!

01:06:34.188 --> 01:06:35.621
It went off.

01:06:35.956 --> 01:06:37.355
I was just trying to help.

01:06:44.465 --> 01:06:45.625
Come on.

01:06:47.801 --> 01:06:51.965
Now, I'd say, "Your money or your life,"
but since your money is your life...

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.369
How dare you steal from me?

01:06:54.541 --> 01:06:56.031
- Don't think of it as stealing.
- No?

01:06:56.310 --> 01:06:58.301
Think of it as repossession.

01:06:58.379 --> 01:07:00.711
I'll leave you with
what I've had most every day of my life.

01:07:01.548 --> 01:07:03.038
- One day.
- One day?

01:07:04.218 --> 01:07:05.276
Are you insane?

01:07:06.186 --> 01:07:07.175
You can do a lot in a day.

01:07:10.491 --> 01:07:11.822
Those are pretty.

01:07:18.499 --> 01:07:19.625
I owe you these.

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.327
You shouldn't have.

01:07:22.002 --> 01:07:23.333
You, out.

01:07:30.244 --> 01:07:33.077
<i>Will Salas, prime
suspect in the murder of Henry Hamilton,</i>

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:36.115
<i>is believed to be traveling with Sylvia Weis,</i>

01:07:36.183 --> 01:07:38.481
<i>daughter of finance magnate, Philippe Weis.</i>

01:07:38.552 --> 01:07:40.816
<i>Citizens are advised to exercise extreme...</i>

01:07:44.425 --> 01:07:46.188
We look cute together.

01:07:50.197 --> 01:07:52.028
It doesn't say you're wanted.

01:07:53.701 --> 01:07:55.532
It doesn't say I'm not.

01:07:56.603 --> 01:07:58.935
You've forgotten I shot a cop.

01:08:00.207 --> 01:08:02.266
I admit, not very well.

01:08:03.043 --> 01:08:04.601
It was your first time.

01:08:07.381 --> 01:08:08.370
Hey.

01:08:08.716 --> 01:08:11.378
I can say I made you do all of it.

01:08:12.386 --> 01:08:14.047
You can go back.

01:08:14.288 --> 01:08:15.949
Go back to what?

01:08:17.624 --> 01:08:21.560
Do I really want to spend my whole life
trying not to die by mistake?

01:08:24.231 --> 01:08:26.961
A lot of people would say
being here is a mistake.

01:08:29.569 --> 01:08:31.231
I don't have a choice.

01:08:34.241 --> 01:08:36.265
I'm starting to think that I don't, either.

01:08:57.497 --> 01:09:00.990
I want to reassure you all
there is no cause for alarm.

01:09:01.068 --> 01:09:02.261
No ransom was paid.

01:09:02.603 --> 01:09:04.502
<i>Your Zone is at risk, Philippe.</i>

01:09:04.604 --> 01:09:07.267
<i>It puts us at risk. It can spread.</i>

01:09:07.441 --> 01:09:10.274
<i>Too much time in the wrong hands
can crash the market.</i>

01:09:10.511 --> 01:09:12.671
This hostage situation
will be quickly resolved.

01:09:12.746 --> 01:09:14.212
Sir.

01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:20.350
Everything is under control. We'll talk soon.

01:09:27.127 --> 01:09:29.254
Timekeeper. After this regrettable incident,

01:09:29.328 --> 01:09:32.127
it's really not necessary
for you to come in person.

01:09:33.133 --> 01:09:36.796
I'm afraid it really is necessary.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:41.529
When can we hope for a rescue?

01:09:41.809 --> 01:09:43.606
I believe that's the point.

01:09:43.676 --> 01:09:45.542
She doesn't appear to want to be rescued.

01:09:47.314 --> 01:09:48.804
Mr. Leon.

01:09:50.317 --> 01:09:53.046
Raymond. May I call you Raymond?

01:09:55.322 --> 01:09:56.880
I blame myself.

01:09:57.891 --> 01:09:59.916
I invited the man into my home.

01:09:59.993 --> 01:10:01.984
He had so much time,
how was I supposed to know?

01:10:03.831 --> 01:10:08.165
Of course, Sylvia brought this on herself
by her lack of vigilance.

01:10:08.735 --> 01:10:11.226
That's why I always tried to keep her close.

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:16.173
But she is clearly under Will Salas' control.

01:10:24.351 --> 01:10:26.216
If it's a matter of resources,

01:10:26.787 --> 01:10:29.221
I'm happy to make a contribution.

01:10:31.024 --> 01:10:33.254
It's a scandal,
what we pay our Timekeepers.

01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:39.191
I've issued a warrant
for your daughter's arrest.

01:10:39.867 --> 01:10:42.427
If she contacts you
and you assist her in any way,

01:10:42.536 --> 01:10:44.367
I will issue a warrant for your arrest.

01:10:55.716 --> 01:10:58.048
There is nothing I cannot buy.

01:11:00.387 --> 01:11:01.445
Now

01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:04.951
how many of my years do you want?

01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:09.051
There aren't enough years,

01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:14.360
even in your lifetime, Mr. Weis. Good night.

01:11:19.573 --> 01:11:21.734
This is called a trigger.

01:11:22.442 --> 01:11:25.775
And you don't pull it until
you actually want to shoot something.

01:11:32.886 --> 01:11:34.148
I wanted to shoot something.

01:11:34.221 --> 01:11:35.245
Right.

01:11:39.793 --> 01:11:41.761
Will, if you get a lot of time,

01:11:44.064 --> 01:11:45.326
are you really gonna give it away?

01:11:46.466 --> 01:11:48.297
I've only ever had a day.

01:11:49.236 --> 01:11:50.794
How much do you need?

01:11:52.239 --> 01:11:53.900
How can you live with yourself
watching people die

01:11:53.974 --> 01:11:55.066
right next to you?

01:11:56.643 --> 01:11:58.235
You don't watch.

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:01.070
You close your eyes.

01:12:10.757 --> 01:12:12.918
I can help you get all the time you want.

01:12:20.467 --> 01:12:23.061
I need to borrow a month.
What's the interest?

01:12:23.804 --> 01:12:25.567
Today's rate, 30%.

01:12:26.807 --> 01:12:28.297
I can't pay it back.

01:12:28.575 --> 01:12:30.736
We can always come to some arrangement.

01:12:56.503 --> 01:12:57.663
Let's go.

01:13:00.274 --> 01:13:03.971
Ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to
announce that Weis Timelenders

01:13:04.044 --> 01:13:06.979
is now offering interest-free
loans with no payments.

01:13:07.047 --> 01:13:08.105
Ever.

01:13:08.181 --> 01:13:09.671
So help yourselves and take a day.

01:13:09.816 --> 01:13:11.340
Take a month. Hell, take a year.

01:13:11.518 --> 01:13:13.611
Come on. Help yourselves! Take it.

01:13:13.687 --> 01:13:15.154
Take the time. It's free.

01:13:50.557 --> 01:13:52.718
No one's watching their clocks, huh?

01:13:53.226 --> 01:13:55.592
Get out of here,
or I'll confiscate every second!

01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:04.765
Must've thought it was a drive-through.

01:14:37.704 --> 01:14:38.693
Turn around.

01:14:39.272 --> 01:14:40.296
Don't move.

01:14:40.374 --> 01:14:41.966
I don't have much.

01:14:42.042 --> 01:14:43.600
Everything I have, I give away.

01:14:43.710 --> 01:14:44.699
I know.

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:08.891
Yes, sir, I do know that, sir.

01:15:10.404 --> 01:15:12.565
There are years that shouldn't be there.

01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:18.571
I will stop him, sir.

01:15:20.647 --> 01:15:21.807
Doesn't he understand

01:15:21.882 --> 01:15:24.316
he's hurting the very people
he's trying to help?

01:15:33.994 --> 01:15:35.325
Well, now.

01:15:36.296 --> 01:15:38.264
- Look at all that.
- Yeah.

01:15:38.932 --> 01:15:40.763
I finally had time to buy one of these.

01:15:43.437 --> 01:15:45.166
Let's not do anything I might regret.

01:16:18.805 --> 01:16:20.534
What was that about?

01:16:21.408 --> 01:16:22.841
I wasted 30 days.

01:16:22.909 --> 01:16:26.504
<i>Today, Sylvia Weis
withdrew some of her "inheritance"</i>

01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:29.048
<i>when she and Will Salas
robbed her father's time bank</i>

01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:31.709
<i>for the sixth time in a week.</i>

01:16:32.552 --> 01:16:33.541
I give her everything.

01:16:35.222 --> 01:16:36.814
Does she want to kill me?

01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:38.880
You were killing her, Philippe.

01:16:41.161 --> 01:16:42.822
You were suffocating her.

01:16:45.065 --> 01:16:46.726
You suffocate us all.

01:16:51.505 --> 01:16:52.563
Call.

01:16:58.845 --> 01:17:00.176
That's good.

01:17:00.747 --> 01:17:03.238
Just not as good as that.

01:17:03.316 --> 01:17:04.305
Ooh!

01:17:05.519 --> 01:17:07.510
You haven't forgotten how to play cards.

01:17:08.088 --> 01:17:10.420
Why did I play strip poker with you?

01:17:11.024 --> 01:17:12.514
Why did you?

01:17:18.732 --> 01:17:19.790
Sir.

01:17:20.367 --> 01:17:21.766
They're still there.

01:17:23.436 --> 01:17:25.028
How did you know, sir?

01:17:26.106 --> 01:17:28.438
This is where the hours and the days are.

01:17:30.443 --> 01:17:32.536
He's paid them all off.

01:17:33.446 --> 01:17:34.879
This is where I would hide.

01:17:42.789 --> 01:17:44.279
Put your clothes on.

01:17:51.264 --> 01:17:52.595
Stop!

01:17:54.401 --> 01:17:56.232
- We're trapped!
- No, we're not!

01:17:57.804 --> 01:17:59.294
Jump. They won't do it.

01:17:59.406 --> 01:18:00.464
We shouldn't do it.

01:18:07.247 --> 01:18:08.407
Come on!

01:18:17.424 --> 01:18:19.483
See? They won't jump.

01:18:22.495 --> 01:18:23.621
So much for your theory.

01:18:23.697 --> 01:18:24.925
Shit!

01:18:41.147 --> 01:18:42.307
Here!

01:18:42.782 --> 01:18:43.874
Go!

01:18:47.554 --> 01:18:49.715
Stop! Stop!

01:19:07.607 --> 01:19:09.131
I'm telling you, he'll give up before we do!

01:19:09.209 --> 01:19:10.369
You sure about that?

01:19:11.878 --> 01:19:13.209
No.

01:19:31.731 --> 01:19:33.062
- Go.
- I can't.

01:19:33.166 --> 01:19:34.565
You can! Go!

01:19:37.170 --> 01:19:38.296
Un-fucking-believable!

01:19:52.919 --> 01:19:54.181
Hold on.

01:19:55.088 --> 01:19:56.453
You two look familiar.

01:19:59.759 --> 01:20:00.919
How about now?

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.553
Welcome to the Century.

01:20:28.955 --> 01:20:31.890
Hi. We're looking for a quiet place to stay.

01:20:32.659 --> 01:20:33.683
How many rooms?

01:20:34.327 --> 01:20:35.351
All of them.

01:20:36.162 --> 01:20:37.823
We were hoping for something long-term.

01:20:38.565 --> 01:20:41.398
Can we rely on the discretion of your staff?

01:20:41.634 --> 01:20:43.625
I'm sure you can.

01:20:52.412 --> 01:20:54.243
I'm sorry. We're fully booked.

01:20:56.316 --> 01:20:57.647
Right.

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.151
Nobody goes anywhere!

01:21:09.462 --> 01:21:10.451
Wait, whoa, whoa.

01:21:12.265 --> 01:21:13.254
Don't look at me.

01:21:15.001 --> 01:21:16.764
You know who I'm looking for.

01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:25.274
I'm looking for whoever
gave this man a month!

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:31.673
And I'm gonna clean the clocks off
of every one of you in this hellhole

01:21:31.785 --> 01:21:36.313
until someone says something
I want to hear.

01:21:43.863 --> 01:21:45.194
I can't hear anything.

01:21:49.636 --> 01:21:50.796
Clean it.

01:21:52.672 --> 01:21:55.038
No, wait, wait. Wait. Please!

01:21:56.409 --> 01:21:58.468
Please don't. Please.
I don't know where they are!

01:21:59.746 --> 01:22:00.838
Please.

01:22:03.016 --> 01:22:04.278
Please!

01:22:05.018 --> 01:22:06.178
Please.

01:22:14.928 --> 01:22:16.361
I believe you're next.

01:22:16.963 --> 01:22:17.952
Um...

01:22:19.432 --> 01:22:22.697
At last, someone's acting reasonably.

01:22:23.203 --> 01:22:25.103
I just want a share of the reward.

01:22:34.047 --> 01:22:35.708
My young friend.

01:22:37.383 --> 01:22:39.374
You'll get your reward.

01:22:47.393 --> 01:22:48.724
Ten years.

01:22:52.799 --> 01:22:54.460
That's insulting.

01:23:00.573 --> 01:23:02.234
If they catch us,

01:23:04.077 --> 01:23:06.807
there's no way they won't kill us, is there?

01:23:09.415 --> 01:23:10.905
Do you regret this?

01:23:12.085 --> 01:23:13.916
You saved my life.

01:23:16.256 --> 01:23:17.416
When?

01:23:19.259 --> 01:23:20.487
Now.

01:23:21.427 --> 01:23:23.418
And every day since I met you.

01:23:28.101 --> 01:23:30.831
You forget, I almost got you killed
a few times, too.

01:23:33.273 --> 01:23:35.434
I'm willing to overlook that.

01:23:52.125 --> 01:23:53.786
How's the poor little rich girl?

01:23:54.961 --> 01:23:56.428
I never got a chance to

01:23:57.630 --> 01:23:59.791
properly thank you for your time.

01:24:01.467 --> 01:24:03.458
I'm not surprised you stayed.

01:24:03.970 --> 01:24:06.302
It's the life, isn't it?

01:24:06.973 --> 01:24:09.305
Here we don't stop living

01:24:09.642 --> 01:24:12.475
until we're actually dead.

01:24:14.314 --> 01:24:16.077
There are a lot more ways
to die around here.

01:24:16.983 --> 01:24:19.975
But here, there's dancing before dying.

01:24:27.827 --> 01:24:31.558
Of course, it's your friend
I'm most happy to run into again.

01:24:31.998 --> 01:24:35.331
You've been causing a lot of trouble,
which is normally my job.

01:24:35.735 --> 01:24:36.929
Don't you understand?

01:24:37.904 --> 01:24:42.500
The reason the Timekeepers leave me alone
is 'cause I have boundaries.

01:24:42.575 --> 01:24:45.066
I steal from my own people.

01:24:45.912 --> 01:24:49.678
You surely know things are bad
when I have to restore order.

01:24:52.685 --> 01:24:56.849
Fortunately for you,
I don't like to kill a man in cold blood.

01:24:57.523 --> 01:24:58.683
I do it,

01:24:59.192 --> 01:25:02.855
but I prefer not to.

01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:13.261
I think you deserve a fighting chance.

01:25:20.213 --> 01:25:21.942
We play to zero.

01:25:22.949 --> 01:25:24.439
What's the point?

01:25:25.051 --> 01:25:28.714
I lose, I die. I win, they kill me.

01:25:30.056 --> 01:25:33.219
If you don't fight, I'll kill you now.

01:25:33.793 --> 01:25:34.817
And her?

01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:37.787
After I take you,

01:25:38.731 --> 01:25:39.789
I'll take her.

01:25:43.569 --> 01:25:45.901
Oh, yeah. And her time.

01:25:47.473 --> 01:25:49.031
Then I'll collect my reward

01:25:49.108 --> 01:25:51.576
for making everything right in the world.

01:27:13.526 --> 01:27:14.515
This way!

01:27:22.535 --> 01:27:24.696
All the time he's taken.

01:27:25.538 --> 01:27:27.301
Don't you mean the time
he's given away, sir?

01:27:30.376 --> 01:27:31.775
Even to you?

01:27:39.552 --> 01:27:44.387
I have given 50 years of my life to this job.

01:27:45.224 --> 01:27:48.216
I am not about to see
those years go to waste.

01:27:50.129 --> 01:27:51.460
Go on.

01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:10.744
I'm sorry to be the one to break this to you,

01:28:11.651 --> 01:28:13.312
but by tomorrow

01:28:13.586 --> 01:28:15.315
you won't have time to stand around.

01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:35.601
God damn it.

01:28:39.445 --> 01:28:40.776
It's over.

01:28:41.113 --> 01:28:43.013
We lost. We're not doing any good.

01:28:43.349 --> 01:28:44.577
At least we're trying.

01:28:45.618 --> 01:28:49.952
No. You don't understand. All they have to
do is keep raising the cost of living.

01:28:50.289 --> 01:28:53.952
A hundred years. Two. A thousand.
It does nothing.

01:28:54.193 --> 01:28:55.785
So, what? We just stop fighting?

01:28:56.028 --> 01:28:58.758
We can't win. We can't hurt them.

01:28:58.831 --> 01:29:00.765
The time we're taking
makes no damn difference!

01:29:00.833 --> 01:29:02.960
What would? What would hurt them?

01:29:03.536 --> 01:29:07.131
A million years.
You got a million years on you?

01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:13.801
I guess it really would take a million years.

01:29:17.883 --> 01:29:19.145
Let's give up.

01:29:45.911 --> 01:29:47.242
Stop!

01:29:48.914 --> 01:29:50.347
I am Sylvia Weis.

01:29:52.685 --> 01:29:54.346
I want to surrender,

01:29:55.021 --> 01:29:56.648
but only to my father.

01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:02.384
Sylvia.

01:30:04.530 --> 01:30:05.997
Hello, Daddy.

01:30:08.834 --> 01:30:09.926
Stay where you are!

01:30:11.937 --> 01:30:14.201
You've hired more guards
since I last saw you.

01:30:14.307 --> 01:30:15.604
Thanks to you, I need them.

01:30:16.208 --> 01:30:17.539
One too many.

01:30:19.245 --> 01:30:20.473
Guns down.

01:30:22.048 --> 01:30:23.208
Now!

01:30:24.016 --> 01:30:25.005
Do it.

01:30:35.561 --> 01:30:37.324
Let's go for a ride.

01:30:44.737 --> 01:30:46.898
You'd steal from your own father.

01:30:47.239 --> 01:30:49.730
Is it stealing if it's already stolen?

01:31:04.423 --> 01:31:05.890
What's the combination?

01:31:06.992 --> 01:31:08.926
Well, it's not my birthday.

01:31:08.994 --> 01:31:12.157
You've started to regret that day,
I imagine, Father.

01:31:13.432 --> 01:31:16.094
Try 12-2-18-09.

01:31:17.670 --> 01:31:19.433
Darwin's birthday.

01:31:21.507 --> 01:31:23.270
Survival of the fittest.

01:31:25.745 --> 01:31:28.646
It cost us centuries
just to bribe our way in here.

01:31:29.448 --> 01:31:30.938
Let's see what it got us.

01:31:47.967 --> 01:31:49.457
Quality time.

01:31:51.303 --> 01:31:53.965
There really is a man with a million years.

01:31:54.039 --> 01:31:56.872
That's my first million. It won't be my last.

01:31:56.976 --> 01:31:58.307
You know how much good it could do?

01:31:58.377 --> 01:32:00.311
I know how much harm it could do.

01:32:00.379 --> 01:32:03.177
Try to understand,
even if you gave a year to a million people,

01:32:03.249 --> 01:32:04.648
you're just prolonging their agony.

01:32:04.717 --> 01:32:06.651
You're prolonging their lives.

01:32:07.153 --> 01:32:11.146
Flooding the wrong Zone with a million
years, it could cripple the system.

01:32:11.223 --> 01:32:12.554
Let's hope so.

01:32:12.658 --> 01:32:16.822
We're not meant to live like this.
We're not meant to live forever.

01:32:17.730 --> 01:32:21.962
Although I do wonder, Father,
if you've ever lived a day in your life.

01:32:22.501 --> 01:32:26.835
Is that so? You might upset
the balance for a generation.

01:32:27.339 --> 01:32:28.499
Two.

01:32:29.508 --> 01:32:32.500
But don't fool yourself.
In the end, nothing will change.

01:32:33.345 --> 01:32:35.336
Because everyone wants to live forever.

01:32:36.749 --> 01:32:39.650
They all think they have
a chance at immortality

01:32:39.718 --> 01:32:41.549
even though all the evidence is against it.

01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:45.282
They all think they will be the exception.

01:32:45.357 --> 01:32:47.848
But the truth is,

01:32:48.194 --> 01:32:50.321
for a few to be immortal, many must die.

01:33:06.712 --> 01:33:09.545
No one should be immortal

01:33:10.382 --> 01:33:12.612
if even one person has to die.

01:33:27.399 --> 01:33:28.798
What was that?

01:33:29.568 --> 01:33:32.059
What was that? What just happened?

01:33:34.139 --> 01:33:37.131
It must be a mistake. A million years
just went off the clock in New Greenwich.

01:33:37.243 --> 01:33:38.471
It's not a mistake.

01:33:38.744 --> 01:33:39.733
It's gotta be a mistake, sir.

01:33:39.812 --> 01:33:40.972
It's not a mistake.

01:33:42.715 --> 01:33:43.773
It's them.

01:33:48.754 --> 01:33:49.812
Take a month, Maurice.

01:34:06.505 --> 01:34:08.530
Dispatch, what can you see?

01:34:08.607 --> 01:34:10.234
<i>There's a lot of traffic
in the vicinity, sir.</i>

01:34:10.309 --> 01:34:12.539
All right, look for the slowest car.

01:34:13.679 --> 01:34:18.116
You have a million years.
You are definitely not in a hurry.

01:34:20.786 --> 01:34:22.447
If this works...

01:34:22.688 --> 01:34:24.952
If this works, we gotta get more.

01:34:25.357 --> 01:34:28.019
Dayton's not the only zone that
can use a few extra years.

01:34:30.796 --> 01:34:32.787
And wire me my per diem.

01:34:32.865 --> 01:34:34.355
Wait. Never mind.

01:34:34.466 --> 01:34:35.797
I have him.

01:34:43.475 --> 01:34:45.466
Give the order, shoot on sight.

01:34:45.544 --> 01:34:47.705
<i>In New Greenwich?
That's against policy, sir.</i>

01:34:47.813 --> 01:34:50.043
So is having a million years leave the Zone.

01:35:07.866 --> 01:35:10.198
That time cannot leave the Zone!
Shoot on sight!

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:38.652
<i>Please deposit
one month. Please deposit one month.</i>

01:35:51.276 --> 01:35:52.903
Keep going! Keep going!

01:35:52.978 --> 01:35:54.036
We're close!

01:35:54.613 --> 01:35:55.944
We're okay! We're okay!

01:36:10.462 --> 01:36:11.486
You're late.

01:36:13.899 --> 01:36:14.991
Need a minute?

01:36:17.736 --> 01:36:19.135
Go. Go.

01:36:20.406 --> 01:36:21.998
Where's our capsule?

01:36:22.441 --> 01:36:23.567
Too late.

01:36:29.081 --> 01:36:30.673
Lost a lot of time, Mr. Leon.

01:36:31.083 --> 01:36:32.914
Looks like you're about out yourself.

01:36:36.388 --> 01:36:37.582
- Time!
- There's time!

01:36:37.656 --> 01:36:38.680
Move!

01:36:55.774 --> 01:36:57.105
Move!

01:37:01.113 --> 01:37:03.604
You, get out! Get out!

01:37:19.798 --> 01:37:21.629
We gotta get to Livingston.

01:37:23.469 --> 01:37:24.766
We can make it.

01:37:24.837 --> 01:37:25.963
Can we?

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:35.640
You okay?

01:38:02.407 --> 01:38:03.738
Stop!

01:38:10.516 --> 01:38:11.642
You can run.

01:38:13.752 --> 01:38:15.151
So can you.

01:38:17.856 --> 01:38:19.653
You're from here, aren't you?

01:38:22.194 --> 01:38:23.718
Long time ago.

01:38:24.296 --> 01:38:25.285
Yeah.

01:38:25.764 --> 01:38:27.664
I worked out how to escape.

01:38:27.933 --> 01:38:30.265
And now you make sure no one else does.

01:38:30.335 --> 01:38:31.859
That's the way it has to be.

01:38:33.705 --> 01:38:35.536
I didn't start the clock.

01:38:37.042 --> 01:38:38.669
I can't turn it back.

01:38:40.212 --> 01:38:41.543
I keep it running.

01:38:42.381 --> 01:38:43.678
I keep time.

01:38:44.883 --> 01:38:46.544
"I keep time."

01:38:50.889 --> 01:38:53.517
I'm gonna need some of that time
you borrowed from me.

01:38:56.228 --> 01:38:59.288
Unless you want us to die
on the way to our execution.

01:39:03.902 --> 01:39:05.233
Time.

01:39:27.492 --> 01:39:28.982
We don't have enough.

01:39:32.431 --> 01:39:34.490
One of us can make it. Take mine.

01:39:34.766 --> 01:39:37.735
You take mine. You can get there, I can't!
I can't get there. You can.

01:39:37.803 --> 01:39:40.067
- No. No.
- Yes!

01:39:41.607 --> 01:39:42.767
Please.

01:39:43.108 --> 01:39:44.268
No.

01:39:53.952 --> 01:39:55.283
There's time.

01:39:55.721 --> 01:39:58.155
- What?
- The Keeper's time. Run. Run!

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:09.531
Run!

01:40:23.315 --> 01:40:24.304
I need time.

01:40:24.383 --> 01:40:26.146
<i>Time transfer.</i>

01:40:49.808 --> 01:40:51.139
What have we got?

01:40:52.311 --> 01:40:53.573
A day.

01:40:54.379 --> 01:40:55.710
Could do a lot in a day.

01:41:11.229 --> 01:41:13.493
Sir, do something.

01:41:15.334 --> 01:41:16.995
It's already done.

01:41:17.869 --> 01:41:20.064
<i>These are
live pictures from Dayton.</i>

01:41:20.138 --> 01:41:22.265
<i>Citizens have taken to the streets.</i>

01:41:22.374 --> 01:41:24.865
<i>There's so much stolen time in circulation.</i>

01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:27.007
<i>Factories in Dayton lie idle.</i>

01:41:27.245 --> 01:41:29.372
<i>And now, citizens are crossing Zones,</i>

01:41:29.448 --> 01:41:30.915
<i>seen here entering New Greenwich.</i>

01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:34.041
<i>While authorities claim
they have the situation</i>

01:41:34.119 --> 01:41:38.385
<i>under control, others fear the system
may be headed for collapse.</i>

01:41:38.457 --> 01:41:41.483
<i>We will continue to update you
on this developing story.</i>

01:41:41.893 --> 01:41:43.588
Sir, we lost Zone Eight.

01:41:43.662 --> 01:41:44.686
And Ten.

01:41:49.034 --> 01:41:50.592
It's spreading.

01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:53.498
What do we do, sir?

01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:56.371
Go home.

01:42:04.883 --> 01:42:09.149
<i>Still no sign of
fugitives Will Salas and Sylvia Weis.</i>

01:42:09.254 --> 01:42:11.814
<i>Authorities continue to ask
for the public's help</i>

01:42:11.890 --> 01:42:14.916
<i>in bringing these criminals to justice.</i>

01:42:33.979 --> 01:42:35.640
Told you there were bigger banks.

01:42:37.582 --> 01:42:38.913
You almost missed your calling.
