WEBVTT

00:06.107 --> 00:09.043
WALT, YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY
DON'T HAVE TO COOK FOR ME.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.611
IT'S NO TROUBLE.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.746
SEE, THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF THE CROCK-POT.

00:12.780 --> 00:17.451
YOU JUST TOSS IN BEANS,
MEAT, VEGETABLES,
WHAT HAVE YOU,

00:17.485 --> 00:18.552
AND LEAVE IT ON.

00:18.586 --> 00:23.057
THEN 24 HOURS A DAY
WHENEVER YOU WANT IT,
HOT CHILI.

00:23.091 --> 00:26.194
WELL, I'M OFF TO THE GOWANS
TO BABY-SIT.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.429
YOU GOT TO LEAVE SO SOON?
I'M MAKING CHILI.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.164
OH. YEAH. THANKS, GRANDPA,

00:30.198 --> 00:33.134
BUT, UM, I'M A VEGETARIAN.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.736
THAT'S OK.
IT'S JUST GOT TURKEY.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.138
TURKEY'S MEAT.

00:37.171 --> 00:40.808
YEAH. WELL, IT'S NOT
AS MEATY AS BEEF.

00:41.409 --> 00:43.444
BYE.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.179
YOU GOT A DISHRAG?

00:45.213 --> 00:47.115
YEAH.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.017
JIMMY.
HUH?

00:50.050 --> 00:52.153
JIMMY, YOU CAN'T SLEEP
ON THE DRYER.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.088
OH, BUT IT'S SO WARM.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.556
SO IS YOUR BED. COME ON.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.158
I CAN'T SLEEP
IN MY BED.

00:57.191 --> 01:00.361
IT'S TEEMING
WITH DISGUSTING GROSSNESS,

01:00.394 --> 01:02.663
AND I'M NEVER GOING
NEAR IT AGAIN.

01:02.696 --> 01:05.099
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?
NOTHING.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.400
WHERE WAS HE SLEEPING
THIS TIME?

01:06.434 --> 01:09.337
DRYER.
WHAT'S WITH THE KID
AND THE BED?

01:09.370 --> 01:11.172
WELL, IT WAS
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,

01:11.205 --> 01:14.342
AND CLAUDIA WAS CLEANING
THE BOYS' ROOM.

01:15.909 --> 01:20.614
HEY, SEAN.
SWEETIE, WILL YOU GIVE ME
A HAND WITH THIS, PLEASE?

01:20.648 --> 01:21.682
OH. YEAH, BABE.

01:21.715 --> 01:25.253
THANK YOU.
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.124
THANK YOU.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.162
HELLO.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.330
HI.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.704
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

01:43.737 --> 01:44.905
MAKING THE BED.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.341
LET ME GET THIS CORNER
TUCKED IN QUICKLY.

01:47.375 --> 01:50.244
I GOT TO HOLD THE SHEET DOWN
WITH MY FOOT, AND...

01:50.278 --> 01:52.280
COME ON.
YOU'RE RUINING IT.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.215
JUST A MINUTE.
IS EVERYBODY
OUT OF THE HOUSE?

01:54.248 --> 01:57.685
YEAH. YEAH, THEY'RE ALL GONE.
YEAH?

02:05.893 --> 02:09.563
RIGHT THERE,
IN JIMMY'S BED?

02:10.531 --> 02:11.232
YEAH.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.767
ON THE STAR WARS SHEETS?

02:13.801 --> 02:17.538
ON THE DIGIMON SHEETS.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.474
SO, HOW DID JIMMY FIND OUT?

02:20.508 --> 02:23.544
WELL, THERE WAS
A BREACH IN SECURITY.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.792
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

02:38.826 --> 02:41.362
AAH!
AAH!

02:41.995 --> 02:45.866
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
ON YOUR FATHER.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.401
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING?

02:47.435 --> 02:49.903
I'VE GOT IT.
OK, GOOD. WHOO!

02:49.937 --> 02:54.275
Claudia: SEE YOU LATER.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.593
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE TWO
OF YOU PERFORMING LIKE THAT

03:12.626 --> 03:14.562
IN FRONT OF YOUR
8-YEAR-OLD SON.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.997
COME ON, WALT. WE DIDN'T
SEND OUT INVITATIONS.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.900
HE JUST WALKED IN ON US.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.235
SO, DID YOU STOP?

03:21.269 --> 03:22.336
YES, WE STOPPED.

03:22.370 --> 03:26.574
WHY? YOU'D ALREADY EXPOSED
THE KID TO THE PRIMAL SCENE.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.276
THE PRIMAL SCENE?

03:28.309 --> 03:30.278
AS FREUD WOULD CALL IT.
OH, COME ON.

03:30.311 --> 03:33.581
YOU EXPOSE A KID TO HIS
PARENTS' RAW SEXUALITY,

03:33.614 --> 03:36.650
THE KID DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO PROCESS WHAT HE SEES,

03:36.684 --> 03:38.319
SAID KID GOES INSANE.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.254
OH! GET OUT OF HERE.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.154
READ FREUD, MAN.

03:41.188 --> 03:44.258
WHAT DOES FREUD SAY
ABOUT DEVIANT PARENTS?

03:44.292 --> 03:45.593
QUITE A LOT, ACTUALLY.

03:45.626 --> 03:49.263
WHAT IS DEVIANT
ABOUT A MARRIED COUPLE
HAVING SEX?

03:49.297 --> 03:51.665
YOU WERE DOING IT
IN THE DAYTIME.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.701
LOOK, WE GOT TO SEIZE
THE MOMENT WHEN WE CAN.

03:53.734 --> 03:57.004
WE GOT THREE KIDS.
WE DON'T HAVE AN AWFUL
LOT OF ALONE TIME.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.772
NO, WE'RE NEVER ALONE.

03:58.806 --> 04:02.009
Man: IN SPORTS,
THE INTERNATIONAL BASKETBALL
LEAGUE WAS BUSY LAST NIGHT...

04:08.749 --> 04:10.718
WHAT'S GOING ON UP THERE?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.920
Sean: EDDIE, GO HOME!

04:12.953 --> 04:16.290
WELL, IF YOU HAD TOLD ME
YOU GUYS WERE DOING STUFF,

04:16.324 --> 04:18.058
I WOULD'VE TURNED
THE TV UP.

04:18.091 --> 04:22.330
WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE TO TELL YOU
WHEN WE'RE DOING STUFF

04:22.363 --> 04:23.397
IN OUR OWN HOUSE.

04:23.431 --> 04:26.967
BUT I'D TELL YOU IF I WAS
DOING STUFF IN YOUR HOUSE.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.304
DON'T BE DOING STUFF
IN OUR HOUSE.

04:30.338 --> 04:34.041
BUT IT'S SO QUIET HERE
DURING THE DAYTIME.

04:35.576 --> 04:38.346
CHANGE THE LOCKS.

04:38.379 --> 04:41.349
HE'D JUST BREAK IN.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.318
OH, GOD, DAD!
WHAT STINKS?

04:44.352 --> 04:48.722
IT'S NOT STINK.
THAT'S FLAVOR.

04:48.756 --> 04:52.025
MY GOD. WHAT ARE YOU
COOKING, A POSSUM?

04:54.428 --> 04:56.029
JIMMY, IF YOU WANNA
SLEEP SOMEWHERE

04:56.063 --> 04:57.798
WHERE YOUR PARENTS
HAVEN'T DONE IT,

04:57.831 --> 05:00.067
I WOULDN'T GET TOO
COMFORTABLE ON THE COUCH.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.168
Sean:
EDDIE, COME ON.

05:01.201 --> 05:04.472
AND YOU MIGHT WANNA STEER
CLEAR OF THE LA-Z-BOY, TOO,

05:04.505 --> 05:08.041
AND THE PIANO AND THE TABLE
AND THE FRONT LAWN.

05:08.075 --> 05:11.078
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.179
YOU SEE?

05:12.212 --> 05:15.082
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET
FOR YOUR EXHIBITIONIST
BEHAVIOR.

05:15.115 --> 05:18.986
WALT, WE DIDN'T WANT HENRY
TO SEE WHAT WE WERE DOING.

05:19.019 --> 05:19.987
HE JUST DID.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.390
IT WAS UNFORTUNATE,
BUT I HANDLED IT, ALL RIGHT?

05:22.423 --> 05:23.757
AND HOW EXACTLY
DID YOU HANDLE IT?

05:23.791 --> 05:26.927
WELL, DAD, THROUGH AN HONEST
AND OPEN DISCUSSION.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.029
AH, CHRISTMAS.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.063
HE WAS CURIOUS.

05:30.097 --> 05:33.634
YEAH. WHEN YOU WERE HIS AGE,
YOU WERE CURIOUS, TOO.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.669
BUT I HANDLED IT.

05:35.703 --> 05:38.038
I LAID IT OUT
NICE AND STRAIGHT.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.874
YEAH, DAD. YOU SURE DID.

05:40.908 --> 05:45.913
SEAN, I'M GONNA SAY THIS
ONCE AND ONCE ONLY.

05:45.946 --> 05:49.583
SEX IS A DIRTY,
DIRTY THING

05:49.617 --> 05:52.085
FOR VERY BAD PEOPLE.

05:52.119 --> 05:56.023
SEE, THAT'S JUST IT.
WE DIDN'T WANNA
GIVE HIM A COMPLEX.

05:56.056 --> 06:00.994
WHAT COMPLEX?
THAT WAS SOUND ADVICE.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.731
AND IF YOU'D LISTENED
TO ME BACK THEN,

06:03.764 --> 06:07.968
YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE GOTTEN A CRIB
FOR A GRADUATION PRESENT.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.937
DAD, WE'RE NOT GONNA
TELL HIM SEX IS BAD.

06:09.970 --> 06:13.707
IF WE STIGMATIZE IT,
HE'S GONNA GET
ALL NEUROTIC ABOUT IT.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.108
WE WANT OUR KIDS
TO BE RAISED NOT ASHAMED.

06:15.142 --> 06:19.847
YEAH, WE WANT THEM
TO BE COMFORTABLE COMING
TO US WITH THEIR QUESTIONS.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.484
AND IT WORKED?

06:24.184 --> 06:26.954
WE HAD A NICE TALK.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.989
HENRY, WHAT YOU SAW US
DOING UP THERE,

06:29.022 --> 06:33.894
UM, THAT WAS A PURE AND
JOYFUL EXPRESSION OF LOVE

06:33.927 --> 06:36.129
BETWEEN YOUR MOTHER AND ME.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.098
LOOKED LIKE A LOT OF WORK.

06:38.131 --> 06:41.602
WELL, YES, IT
CAN BE STRENUOUS.

06:41.635 --> 06:42.470
BUT REMEMBER,

06:42.503 --> 06:45.906
HENRY, IT'S, UH,
TRULY A BEAUTIFUL THING,

06:45.939 --> 06:48.676
AND IT'S NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED ABOUT.

06:48.709 --> 06:51.178
THEN WHY DID YOU STOP?

06:51.211 --> 06:52.412
OK, A GOOD QUESTION.

06:52.446 --> 06:55.616
UM, WE STOPPED BECAUSE,
UH, WE WERE SAVING
THE REST FOR LATER

06:55.649 --> 06:57.651
'CAUSE IT'S SO GREAT.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.887
LOOKS LIKE MOM WAS WINNING.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.822
OH, WELL, HENRY,
WIN OR LOSE,

07:01.855 --> 07:04.124
IT'S ALWAYS FUN
TO PLAY THE GAME.

07:04.157 --> 07:04.992
WHEN CAN I PLAY?

07:05.025 --> 07:07.060
WELL, HENRY, IT'S LIKE
A ROLLER COASTER.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.162
THERE'S A HEIGHT
AND WEIGHT REQUIREMENT.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.998
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'LL GET THERE, BUDDY.

07:11.031 --> 07:15.102
AND WHEN YOU DO, REMEMBER,
IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND NATURAL,

07:15.135 --> 07:17.838
AND IT'S NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED ABOUT.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.006
OK.
OK.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.207
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, RUN IN THERE.

07:20.240 --> 07:24.211
DON'T LET YOUR BROTHER
SEE THAT CONE.
HE'LL GET JEALOUS. OK?

07:24.244 --> 07:26.179
ALL RIGHT.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.816
I'M A GREAT DAD.

07:28.849 --> 07:32.520
YOU TOLD HIM THERE WAS
NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF?

07:32.553 --> 07:34.722
THERE'S PLENTY
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.256
NO, THERE'S NOT.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.258
YOUR MOTHER,
GOD REST HER SOUL,

07:38.291 --> 07:41.795
WOULD ONLY UNDRESS
ALONE IN THE BATHROOM

07:41.829 --> 07:43.196
IN THE DARK...

07:43.230 --> 07:45.533
WITH ME IN THE GARAGE.

07:45.566 --> 07:49.002
UH, WELL, MOM WAS INSANE.

07:49.036 --> 07:52.540
SHE HAD A HEALTHY
SENSE OF SHAME.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.708
HOW EXACTLY
IS SHAME HEALTHY?

07:54.742 --> 07:56.710
SHAME GIVES YOU
BOUNDARIES.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.546
IT MAKES PEOPLE
ACT CIVILIZED.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.982
ANIMALS HAVE NO SHAME,
AND LOOK AT THEM.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.283
CATS ARE CIVILIZED.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.553
THEY'RE ALWAYS
CLEANING THEMSELVES.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.555
WITH THEIR TONGUES.

08:07.588 --> 08:11.224
AND THEY GO RIGHT
FOR THE WAHOOTY.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.964
YOU OWE ME $40.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.231
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

08:18.265 --> 08:21.569
YOU'VE DESTROYED
MY BABY-SITTING BUSINESS,
AND I HAVE EXPENSES.

08:21.602 --> 08:24.572
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO PAY MY EXPENSES?

08:24.605 --> 08:26.073
HOW DID WE DESTROY
YOUR BABY

08:26.106 --> 08:28.976
WELL, IT TURNS OUT
PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT
TO HIRE A BABY-SITTER

08:29.009 --> 08:32.012
WHOSE PARENTS ARE
THE NEIGHBORHOOD'S
SEX FIENDS.

08:32.045 --> 08:34.548
SO, NOW I'M NOT GONNA
MAKE ANY MONEY,

08:34.582 --> 08:36.684
AND I'M NEVER GONNA HAVE
ANY INDEPENDENCE.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.086
THANK YOU FOR
MAKING ME A PARASITE.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.254
ALL RIGHT. HERE'S 40 BUCKS.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.690
AND BUS FARE.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.558
UH, I GOT 3.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.594
THEY USUALLY
GIVE ME A TIP.

08:46.627 --> 08:47.595
GO.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.797
GO. GO.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.232
SO, THE WHOLE
NEIGHBORHOOD KNOWS?

08:52.265 --> 08:54.668
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW SEAN
LIKES TO BRAG ABOUT STUFF.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.904
I WASN'T BRAGGING ABOUT IT.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.572
NO. HENRY WAS.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.942
I FOUND A BOX TURTLE
BEHIND MY HOUSE.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.745
I SAW MY PARENTS
DOING IT.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.013
WHAT WAS IT LIKE?

09:06.046 --> 09:09.282
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL
AND NATURAL.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.852
YOU CAN LEAVE SOME
OF YOUR CLOTHES ON

09:11.885 --> 09:13.353
OR NONE OF YOUR
CLOTHES ON.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.189
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE
ALL OF YOUR CLOTHES ON.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.226
THAT'S THE ONE WAY
IT JUST CAN'T HAPPEN.

09:19.259 --> 09:22.195
IT LOOKS PRETTY
WEIRD AT FIRST.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.932
BUT MY DAD SAYS
IT'S JOYFUL,

09:24.965 --> 09:27.668
AND THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.704
HE'S RIGHT, RIGHT?

09:30.738 --> 09:34.608
WELL, ANOTHER VICTORY
FOR ENLIGHTENED PARENTING.

09:34.642 --> 09:37.277
OH, COME ON, DAD.
I DON'T GIVE YOU CRAP

09:37.310 --> 09:39.146
EVERY TIME YOUR
SON EDDIE SCREWS UP.

09:39.179 --> 09:42.315
WHY YOU GOT TO START
SLAMMIN' ON ME FOR, MAN?

09:48.889 --> 09:51.058
HI, MR. FINNERTY.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.261
LILY!

09:55.195 --> 09:57.297
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, BRAD?

09:57.330 --> 09:59.132
WELL, I'M SORRY TO HAVE
TO TELL YOU THIS,

09:59.166 --> 10:03.203
BUT MY PARENTS FEEL
THAT YOUR FAMILY'S
A BAD INFLUENCE ON ME.

10:03.236 --> 10:07.274
SO, WE CAN'T SEE
EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.475
OK.

10:08.508 --> 10:13.180
SO, I GUESS
WE CAN'T BE BOYFRIEND
AND GIRLFRIEND ANYMORE.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.082
WE NEVER WERE.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.250
LILY, YOU WANNA
TALK ABOUT IT?

10:17.284 --> 10:18.418
GO AWAY.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.788
LILY, YOU GOT TO BE STRONG.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.790
OK.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.693
WOW.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.363
OW!

10:30.397 --> 10:33.366
OW!

10:36.069 --> 10:37.905
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING UNDER HERE?

10:37.938 --> 10:41.041
WELL, I WAS TRYING
TO GET SOME SLEEP.

10:41.074 --> 10:44.311
MAN, MOM AND DAD
REALLY SCREWED YOU UP.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.112
YEAH.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.414
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA GET OUT OF IT?

10:47.447 --> 10:48.448
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:48.481 --> 10:51.384
MOM AND DAD MADE ME LOSE
A BABY-SITTING GIG TODAY.

10:51.418 --> 10:55.022
I GOT 43 BUCKS OUT OF 'EM.

10:55.055 --> 10:55.689
YOU DID?

10:55.723 --> 10:57.424
YEAH. YOU GOT
TO PLAY IT UP.

10:57.457 --> 10:59.159
THEY WERE IN YOUR BED.

10:59.192 --> 11:02.362
YOU'VE BEEN TRAUMATIZED.
THEY OWE YOU BIG.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.832
YOU KNOW, I JUST
WANNA GET SOME SLEEP.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.466
THAT'S GOOD.
KEEP SAYING THAT.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.969
HOW'D YOU LIKE
A TV IN YOUR ROOM?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.403
TVs ARE REALLY EXPENSIVE.

11:10.437 --> 11:14.374
THEY WON'T LEARN
IF IT DOESN'T HURT.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.444
MAYBE I COULD GET
A MOUNTAIN BIKE.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.980
NOW YOU'RE THINKING.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.816
I'VE BEEN TRAUMATIZED.

11:22.850 --> 11:27.087
MAN, WHY COULDN'T
HAVE THAT BEEN MY BED?

11:30.090 --> 11:31.324
HEY, DID HENRY GET BACK
FROM SCHOOL YET?

11:31.358 --> 11:35.896
I THINK HE'S WAITING
FOR YOU GUYS UPSTAIRS
TO PUT ON A MATINEE.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.132
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.234
THAT KID
IS A BLABBERMOUTH.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.336
GOOD PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
WORKING VERY HARD

11:43.370 --> 11:46.239
TO KEEP SEX EDUCATION
OUT OF THE SCHOOLS.

11:46.273 --> 11:49.376
AND THEN, BAM,
THERE IT IS.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.410
YOU WANT ME TO APOLOGIZE?

11:50.443 --> 11:52.913
I DON'T WANT MY KIDS
TO BE IGNORANT AND REPRESSED.

11:52.946 --> 11:56.083
I DON'T WANT HENRY THINKING
SEXUALITY IS A DIRTY WORD.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.451
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

11:58.485 --> 12:02.055
IT IS THE MOTHER
OF ALL DIRTY WORDS.

12:02.089 --> 12:05.425
ALL THE OTHER DIRTY WORDS
COME FROM IT.

12:05.959 --> 12:09.129
I CAN THINK OF ONE
THAT DOESN'T.

12:09.162 --> 12:12.766
OH, NO.
THAT LINKS UP, TOO.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.068
YEAH, WELL, YOU BETTER
SHUT THIS BOY UP

12:15.102 --> 12:18.038
BEFORE THE TWO OF YOU
GET HAULED DOWN
TO THE SCHOOL.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.340
TOO LATE. WE ALREADY
GOT CALLED IN

12:20.373 --> 12:23.743
TO SEE
THE GUIDANCE COUNSELOR.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.546
PLEASE, CALL ME GARY.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.783
OK. UH, SO, UM...

12:29.817 --> 12:33.353
WHAT'S THIS
ALL ABOUT, GARY?

12:33.386 --> 12:35.455
WELL, SEAN, CLAUDIA,

12:35.488 --> 12:37.490
IT'S ABOUT HENRY.

12:37.524 --> 12:41.862
HE SEEMS TO BE
PREOCCUPIED WITH SEX.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.463
OH?

12:43.496 --> 12:44.898
YES, CLAUDIA.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.234
HE'S BEEN DISCUSSING IT
ON THE LUNCH LINE.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.369
HE DISRUPTED
A KICKBALL GAME.

12:49.402 --> 12:53.440
AND THIS IS WHAT
HE DREW IN ART CLASS.

12:53.473 --> 12:57.377
OH. THIS...THIS
DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

12:57.410 --> 13:01.949
IF YOU TURN IT LIKE THIS,
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE DANCING.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.918
GARY, IT'S REALLY NO BIG DEAL.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.454
IT ALL HAPPENED
BECAUSE HENRY, UH...

13:07.487 --> 13:09.422
HE WALKED IN ON US.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.557
OH.

13:10.590 --> 13:11.558
YEAH.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.893
YOU DON'T LOCK
YOUR DOOR?

13:12.926 --> 13:17.230
OF COURSE WE DO.
WE WERE IN HIS ROOM.

13:17.898 --> 13:18.932
I SEE.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.400
WE THOUGHT
WE WERE ALONE.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.970
SEE, BUT THIS JUST HAPPENED.
AND I KNOW HENRY.

13:23.003 --> 13:27.407
IT'S UNFORTUNATE, BUT IT'S
GONNA BLOW OVER QUICKLY.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.708
I'M NOT
SO SURE, SEAN.

13:28.741 --> 13:32.045
HENRY AND I HAVE SPOKEN,
AND THIS ALL SEEMS
TO BE A MANIFESTATION

13:32.079 --> 13:33.380
OF A MUCH LARGER ISSUE.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.482
DO YOU LIKE TALKING
TO YOUR FRIENDS?
YES.

13:35.515 --> 13:38.185
DO YOU LIKE TELLING YOUR FRIENDS
WHAT GROWN
YES.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.286
DO YOU EVER GET ANGRY

13:39.319 --> 13:41.288
WHEN PEOPLE DON'T LISTEN
TO YOU?
YES.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.422
DO YOU LIKE FIRE?
YES.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.324
COULD YOU WATCH A FIRE?
YES.

13:44.357 --> 13:48.161
ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT FIRE
RIGHT NOW?
YES.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.065
YOU TOTALLY
LED HIM TO THAT.

13:52.099 --> 13:54.234
OR DID HE LEAD ME?

13:54.267 --> 13:57.537
A LOT OF TIMES,
CHILDREN WANT HELP.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.439
OH, HE DOESN'T WANT HELP.

13:59.472 --> 14:00.340
I SPOKE TO HIM
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.509
WELL, I'VE SPOKEN TO HIM
FOR OVER 8 YEARS.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.478
BUT HAVE YOU EVER
REALLY LISTENED TO HIM?

14:05.512 --> 14:07.047
AW, COME ON.
YES, I'VE LISTENED.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.650
I JUST HAD A RUNNING
CONVERSATION WITH HIM FOR
6 MONTHS ABOUT DRAGONBALL Z.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.252
AND HE DID MOST
OF THE TALKING,

14:12.285 --> 14:14.421
BECAUSE I KNOW VERY LITTLE
ABOUT DRAGONBALL Z.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.522
THEY HAVE
THESE ORBS OF POWER.

14:15.555 --> 14:19.026
THEY'RE CALLED DRAGONBALLS.
I KNOW THIS ABOUT MY SON.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.660
HE'S OBSESSIVE.
IT'S NOT ABNORMAL.

14:20.693 --> 14:24.397
IT'S NOT DANGEROUS.
IT'S BECAUSE HE'S 8.

14:24.431 --> 14:27.634
SEAN, WE BOTH WANT
THE SAME THING FOR HENRY.

14:27.667 --> 14:28.735
OH, NO, WE DON'T.

14:28.768 --> 14:31.471
WHAT YOU WANNA DO
IS LABEL HIM CRAZY
AND STIFLE HIM.

14:31.504 --> 14:34.407
I WANT HIM TO BE ABLE
TO TALK ABOUT LIFE
AND NOT BE ASHAMED.

14:34.441 --> 14:39.179
WELL, SEAN, MOST 3rd-GRADERS
DON'T GO AROUND DESCRIBING
MARITAL RELATIONS.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.613
WELL, MAYBE THEY SHOULD.

14:40.647 --> 14:41.548
EXCUSE ME?

14:41.581 --> 14:43.583
YEAH, MAYBE MORE KIDS
SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT,

14:43.616 --> 14:46.586
AND MAYBE WE'D ALL
BE BETTER OFF IF THERE
WERE MORE PARENTS LIKE US

14:46.619 --> 14:50.323
WHO ARE OPEN AND HONEST
ABOUT SEX AND TALKING
ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.

14:50.357 --> 14:53.193
AND I'M SURE YOU'D LIKE KIDS
TO BE REPRESSED AND IGNORANT.

14:53.226 --> 14:58.565
BUT THAT'S JUST NOT
THE FINNERTY WAY.
YOU GOT THAT, GARY?

15:09.442 --> 15:12.312
STOP LOOKING AT US.

15:14.481 --> 15:18.351
ARE YOU GONNA PUT THAT
PICTURE UP ON THE FRIDGE?

15:20.087 --> 15:21.021
NO.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.223
CAN I HAVE IT?

15:23.256 --> 15:24.324
NO.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.658
WE HANDLED THE PROBLEM.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.528
I TOLD THE MAN
HOW IT IS, AND THAT'S THAT.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.498
CAN WE PLEASE
JUST DROP IT?

15:31.531 --> 15:34.134
AND DON'T LIFT THE LID!

15:34.167 --> 15:37.037
EDDIE, YOU LET
ALL THE HEAT OUT.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.539
YOU SET THE WHOLE
OPERATION BACK AN HOUR.

15:39.572 --> 15:43.010
I COULD TELL THEM
I WAS SO TRAUMATIZED,

15:43.043 --> 15:44.044
I NEED THERAPY.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.179
NO, THEN YOU
MIGHT GET THERAPY.

15:46.213 --> 15:49.649
TELL THEM
YOU'RE SO TRAUMATIZED,
YOU NEED A MOUNTAIN BIKE.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.684
TRYING TO GUILT
THE FOLKS, HUH?

15:51.718 --> 15:55.755
YEAH. AFTER WHAT
THEY DID TO HIM,
HE'S ENTITLED TO SOMETHING.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.491
YEAH, BUT WHY STOP AT
A MOUNTAIN BIKE? DVD.

15:58.525 --> 16:03.430
YOU JUST WANT ME
TO GET A DVD PLAYER
SO YOU CAN USE IT.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.498
YEAH.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.699
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET ANYTHING

16:06.733 --> 16:10.703
UNLESS YOU TAKE YOUR PAIN AND
TURN IT INTO SOMETHING USEFUL.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.405
LIKE RAGE.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.541
AH. LISTEN. LEARN.

16:14.574 --> 16:15.608
AND REMEMBER, DVD.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.345
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

16:18.378 --> 16:21.714
MOM, DAD, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

16:21.748 --> 16:23.450
WHAT IS IT, BABE?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.518
YOU GUYS
HAVE TRAUMATIZED ME.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.054
YOU HAVE VIOLATED
MY SPACE,

16:27.087 --> 16:30.423
AND I WILL NEVER
BE ABLE TO SLEEP
IN MY OWN BED AGAIN.

16:30.457 --> 16:33.660
GIVE ME A MOUNTAIN BIKE.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.062
NO.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.263
OK.

16:36.296 --> 16:40.167
OK? I SHOULD GET
A MOUNTAIN BIKE
FOR HAVING TO WATCH THAT.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.636
WHY DON'T YOU
MAKE IT UP TO THE KID?
GET HIM A DVD PLAYER.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.673
NO! NO. NO ONE'S
BEEN TRAUMATIZED.

16:46.706 --> 16:50.277
IT'S NO BIG DEAL,
AND IT'S OVER.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.479
HENRY.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.747
HI, HONEY.
HI.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.685
HI. WHO'S THIS?

16:58.718 --> 17:00.587
FRIENDS.
FROM MY NEW CLASS.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.755
YOU'RE IN A NEW CLASS?

17:02.789 --> 17:04.624
ROOM 219.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.663
YOU'RE IN 219?

17:10.697 --> 17:12.599
HENRY, WHEN DID
THEY PUT YOU IN 219?

17:12.632 --> 17:15.568
THIS MORNING.
GARY BROUGHT ME.

17:33.420 --> 17:36.156
COOL.

17:36.189 --> 17:40.627
WE'RE GONNA GO PLAY
IN MY ROOM. COME ON.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.730
HEY.

17:44.531 --> 17:45.665
GROSS.

17:45.698 --> 17:49.269
UM, WHY DID THEY
PUT HIM IN 219?
HE'S NOT A PROBLEM KID.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.371
YEAH, WE WEREN'T
PROBLEM KIDS.

17:51.404 --> 17:54.607
WE JUST MARCHED
TO A DIFFERENT DRUM.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.743
YOU WERE IN 219?

17:56.776 --> 17:59.479
I STARTED 219.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.115
SEAN, I DON'T WANT
MY BABY IN 219.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.116
YOU THINK I DO?

18:03.150 --> 18:05.685
I BECAME A MAN IN 219.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.189
OH, GOD.

18:12.692 --> 18:13.660
HEY, LILY.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.129
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE AGAIN?

18:16.163 --> 18:17.297
I COULDN'T STAY AWAY.

18:17.330 --> 18:20.667
I CLIMBED OVER THE FENCE
WHEN MY DAD WENT
TO THE BATHROOM.

18:20.700 --> 18:24.737
WELL, HE'S PROBABLY DONE,
SO WHY DON'T YOU
HOP BACK OVER.

18:24.771 --> 18:28.408
NO. LILY, EVER SINCE
I WAS FORBIDDEN
TO HANG AROUND WITH YOU,

18:28.441 --> 18:30.410
I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT YOU.

18:30.443 --> 18:34.714
WHAT, AM I SOME KIND
OF FORBIDDEN FRUIT?

18:34.747 --> 18:35.915
HUH?

18:35.948 --> 18:39.619
YOU WANT ME
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.

18:39.652 --> 18:40.353
YEAH.

18:40.387 --> 18:42.589
WELL, I HAVE NEWS
FOR YOU, BRAD.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.157
YOU COULDN'T HAVE ME BEFORE.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.359
NO. LILY,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

18:46.393 --> 18:47.594
THE MORE MY DAD TELLS ME

18:47.627 --> 18:50.463
HOW YOUR PARENTS
ARE PERVERTED SEX MANIACS,

18:50.497 --> 18:51.264
THE MORE I REALIZE

18:51.298 --> 18:54.334
YOU AND ME WERE BORN
TO BE TOGETHER.

18:54.367 --> 18:57.837
CAN YOU HEAR
WHAT YOU JUST SAID?

18:57.870 --> 18:59.706
YES!

18:59.739 --> 19:01.808
OK, GET OUT.
WHAT?

19:01.841 --> 19:04.411
GET OUT. GET OUT.
GET OUT. GET OUT.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.213
CALL ME, ALL RIGHT?

19:06.246 --> 19:08.315
GET...

19:10.817 --> 19:12.785
WE COULD TALK
ABOUT THIS.

19:12.819 --> 19:13.720
OH, MY GOD.

19:13.753 --> 19:17.690
Sean: GUYS, PARTY'S OVER.
LET'S GO. COME ON.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.125
COME ON.

19:19.158 --> 19:23.196
HENRY, I THOUGHT YOU SAID
WE WERE GONNA GET TO SEE
YOUR PARENTS DOING IT.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.798
COME ON, MOM. PLEASE.
JUST ONCE?

19:25.832 --> 19:26.899
NO.

19:26.933 --> 19:30.237
BUT IT'S BEAUTIFUL
AND NATURAL.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.371
NO.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.873
HENRY, YOUR MOTHER AND I
AREN'T GONNA BE
DOING ANYTHING

19:33.906 --> 19:37.344
IN FRONT OF YOU
AND THESE 219s.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.144
NO OFFENSE.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.814
DAD, WHY DO MY FRIENDS
HAVE TO LEAVE?

19:41.848 --> 19:44.351
'CAUSE I GOT TO TALK
TO YOU, BUDDY.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.218
LET'S GO.

19:45.252 --> 19:48.221
OK, LET'S GO, EVERYBODY.
CLASS DISMISSED.

19:48.255 --> 19:51.291
IT'S A NICE TATTOO.
YOU DO THAT YOURSELF?

19:51.324 --> 19:52.259
YEAH.

19:52.292 --> 19:56.296
COOL. WHY ARE YOU
SO INTO SATIN?

19:56.329 --> 19:57.864
IT SAYS "SATAN."

19:57.897 --> 20:02.335
YOU DON'T WIN
THE SPELLING BEES, DO YOU?

20:02.369 --> 20:03.936
WHAT IS IT, DAD?

20:03.970 --> 20:05.938
WELL, HENRY, UM,

20:05.972 --> 20:09.242
DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT THING THAT, UH...

20:09.276 --> 20:10.209
YOU REMEMBER THAT THING

20:10.243 --> 20:12.812
THAT YOU SAW YOUR MOTHER
AND ME DOING IN HERE?

20:12.845 --> 20:16.349
YEAH. I'VE BEEN TALKING
ALL ABOUT IT. ASK ANYBODY.

20:16.383 --> 20:20.953
I KNOW. AND
THE PROBLEM IS, HENRY,
THAT PEOPLE GET UPSET.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.922
OH.

20:22.955 --> 20:27.260
IT'S THAT BECAUSE
WHAT YOU DID WAS...BAD?

20:27.960 --> 20:29.696
YEAH.

20:30.463 --> 20:31.331
OH.

20:31.364 --> 20:32.465
NO. NO. NO! NO.

20:32.499 --> 20:36.603
SOME PEOPLE, THEY'RE
GONNA SAY IT'S BAD,
BUT IT'S NOT.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.639
SO, I SHOULD
TELL THEM THAT?

20:39.672 --> 20:40.840
NO. YEAH. I MEAN,
I WISH YOU COULD,

20:40.873 --> 20:43.376
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET HANG-UPS
ABOUT THIS THING,

20:43.410 --> 20:46.579
BECAUSE THE WAY MY DAD
TALKED ABOUT IT WITH ME
WAS SO CONFUSING,

20:46.613 --> 20:48.948
AND I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.484
BUT, HENRY, THE WORLD'S
A CONFUSING PLACE,

20:51.518 --> 20:53.286
AND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE
WHO ARE SO HUNG UP

20:53.320 --> 20:56.523
ABOUT STUFF
THAT IS AS NATURAL
AS ANYTHING COULD BE,

20:56.556 --> 20:57.824
BUT THEY DON'T LIKE IT.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.292
AND SO, YOU HAVE
TO ACCOMMODATE THEM.

20:59.326 --> 21:02.862
AND SOMETIMES IT FEELS
LIKE YOU'RE COMPROMISING
YOUR IDEALS, BUT YOU'RE NOT.

21:02.895 --> 21:03.796
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS,

21:03.830 --> 21:08.535
YOU'RE LEARNING HOW
TO DEAL WITH THE WORLD.

21:08.568 --> 21:09.902
DAD.

21:09.936 --> 21:10.770
MM

21:10.803 --> 21:14.441
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
A WORD YOU'RE SAYING.

21:14.474 --> 21:15.074
NO?

21:15.107 --> 21:17.610
WOULD IT BE OK IF I JUST...

21:17.644 --> 21:21.814
DIDN'T TALK ABOUT WHAT
I SAW YOU AND MOM DOING?

21:21.848 --> 21:25.618
OK. HENRY, IF THAT'S
HOW YOU WANNA DEAL WITH IT,

21:25.652 --> 21:27.520
THAT'S FINE BY ME.

21:27.554 --> 21:30.022
THANKS. CAN I WATCH
SCOOBY

21:30.056 --> 21:31.624
SURE. OH, BUT...

21:31.658 --> 21:34.927
THAT THING YOU
SAW US DOING, IT'S GOOD. OK?

21:34.961 --> 21:37.897
I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T GONNA
TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

21:37.930 --> 21:38.898
THAT'S GOOD.

21:38.931 --> 21:41.934
BUT IF YOU WANNA KNOW,
IF YOU'RE EVER CURIOUS...

21:41.968 --> 21:43.102
DAD.
YEAH?

21:43.135 --> 21:44.737
I REALLY WANNA WATCH TV.

21:44.771 --> 21:47.507
THAT'S RIGHT.
BUT I'M JUST SAYING
THAT, YOU KNOW...

21:47.540 --> 21:50.943
DAD. PLEASE, THE TV.
SCOOBY-DOO.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.211
OH, RIGHT. RIGHT.

21:52.244 --> 21:55.748
BUT, HENRY,
THERE'S GONNA BE A TIME
WHEN YOU'RE GONNA WANT...

21:58.751 --> 21:59.952
DON'T.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.654
DON'T WHAT?

22:01.688 --> 22:03.690
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT
PUTTING SOMETHING IN THERE.

22:03.723 --> 22:08.395
NO, FATHER. I ASSURE YOU,
I WASN'T. I WAS JUST...

22:08.428 --> 22:10.797
THINKING MAYBE IT
COULD USE A CARROT.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.666
IT DOESN'T NEED A CARROT.
