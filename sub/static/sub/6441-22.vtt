00:30.564 --> 00:32.429
Dr. Marcus.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.927
What was so urgent you
needed me here tonight?

00:35.236 --> 00:39.172
It's Dr. Walden. There's been a complete
normalization of his higher brain functions.

00:39.340 --> 00:42.332
Considering the source of the trauma,
nothing surprises me.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.844
You mean the Kawatche caves?

00:47.148 --> 00:50.811
How does a linguist go into a coma
deciphering a Native American language?

00:52.353 --> 00:55.789
If you had that answer, doctor,
you'd be running the place.

01:00.961 --> 01:05.057
The day is coming.
The day is coming. The day is coming!

01:24.318 --> 01:26.149
Lana.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.844
It's almost midnight.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.549
Yeah, I took a chance
you'd still be up.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.885
You getting a head start
on your term paper?

01:33.060 --> 01:35.494
I've gotta give the toast
at Lex's rehearsal dinner.

01:35.663 --> 01:38.097
Makes European history
seem like a breeze.

01:42.103 --> 01:46.233
- Am I supposed to guess what's in the box?
- No.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.607
You're supposed to close your eyes.

01:58.185 --> 01:59.652
Don't peek.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.369
Okay.

02:19.039 --> 02:21.769
I know. It's not your birthday
for another seven minutes...

02:21.942 --> 02:24.968
...but I wanted to surprise you.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.646
You did.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.810
I get the feeling
it's not in a good way.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.953
It's just, it's not really
my birthday.

02:41.128 --> 02:45.792
It's just some date my parents picked off
the calendar for the adoption papers.

02:56.911 --> 03:00.847
Maybe some of us want to celebrate
the day you came into our lives.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.184
I never thought of it that way.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.650
Make a wish.

03:17.464 --> 03:21.025
I've been wishing for the same
thing ever since I was 5.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.838
And now?

03:30.144 --> 03:32.578
And now I don't have to.

03:48.395 --> 03:51.364
She's standing right here
in front of me.

05:18.952 --> 05:23.252
- Good morning, Mom.
- How was your birthday party?

05:24.558 --> 05:26.025
So you're the one who told Lana.

05:26.193 --> 05:27.956
She knows we're not
big on birthdays...

05:28.128 --> 05:30.460
...but wondered if she
could do something special.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.326
Thanks.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.434
I feel bad. We never had parties
when you were little...

05:35.602 --> 05:38.264
...but we were always nervous.
- It's okay, I understand.

05:38.439 --> 05:39.701
I know...

05:39.873 --> 05:43.570
...but what mother denies her son a birthday
party? It's a huge part of childhood.

05:43.744 --> 05:46.804
All the mistakes you made with me,
you can correct with the baby.

05:57.124 --> 06:00.992
- Are you prying?
- Okay, never mind.

06:01.161 --> 06:05.894
- Hello. Look what the cat dragged in.
- Lex, have you had breakfast?

06:06.066 --> 06:08.626
Thanks, but I can't stay.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.396
I just wanted to ask you
and Mr. Kent for a favor.

06:13.307 --> 06:17.073
I know we've had our differences,
so this might sound strange...

06:17.244 --> 06:19.235
...but it would mean a lot to me.

06:20.981 --> 06:26.476
It's customary for the bride and groom to sit
with their parents at the rehearsal dinner...

06:27.054 --> 06:30.353
...so since mine won't be there,
I was wondering...

06:30.691 --> 06:33.125
...would the two of you
consider standing in?

06:37.664 --> 06:39.359
Lex, we would be honored.

06:39.700 --> 06:44.103
Great. That just leaves one
open seat at the table.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.100
Right next to you, Clark.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.040
Any suggestions?

07:00.087 --> 07:01.349
Chloe.

07:01.522 --> 07:07.222
The one name you won't find on the list
for Smallville's biggest event of the century.

07:07.394 --> 07:13.094
Don't worry, it's not like I'm holding out for
my fairy godmother to bring glass slippers.

07:13.267 --> 07:18.227
I'm still not convinced Lex won't have me in
a headset, running around with ice buckets.

07:18.405 --> 07:22.034
Is this what you were doing until
2:00 in the morning last night?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.205
Yeah.

07:24.378 --> 07:29.714
Well, I can't vouch for my calligraphy skills,
but if you need any help, just let me know.

07:30.651 --> 07:34.087
Hey, you guys.
I'd like a double espresso, please.

07:36.423 --> 07:39.790
Were you burning
the midnight oil last night too?

07:43.997 --> 07:45.794
I was just...

07:45.966 --> 07:48.196
...working on a toast
for Lex's dinner.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.443
Chloe, ready to go?

08:09.623 --> 08:11.420
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.685
- Great.
- Perfect.

08:14.394 --> 08:16.089
Just checking.

08:16.263 --> 08:20.256
Right. Well...
We better get going.

08:20.434 --> 08:25.428
I have ashes to sweep
and wicked stepsisters to undermine.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.509
- You didn't...?
- No.

08:34.248 --> 08:36.216
I had a really good time last night.

08:36.884 --> 08:41.684
I was thinking maybe we could go out
after the rehearsal dinner tonight.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.616
Maybe.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.397
Lana, is everything okay?

08:59.506 --> 09:02.942
If this is about last night,
we can take it slow.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.509
Clark, I think last night
may have been a mistake.

09:11.451 --> 09:14.215
I'm really busy.
I'll call you later?

09:20.127 --> 09:23.255
Here's the revised seating chart
for the rehearsal dinner.

09:23.430 --> 09:27.230
- Who are the people marked in blue?
- Relatives who still talk to each other.

09:27.401 --> 09:28.663
How about the red?

09:28.835 --> 09:31.998
Family feuds and people who haven't
spoken in at least five years.

09:32.172 --> 09:36.006
- And the yellow ones scattered throughout?
- Buffer zones.

09:36.176 --> 09:40.203
Relatives who have no particular allegiance
and whose conversation won't incite a riot.

09:40.380 --> 09:44.077
If this medical career doesn't work out,
you should consider the United Nations.

09:44.251 --> 09:47.516
- I'm not done yet.
- By the way, put the Kents at our table.

09:47.688 --> 09:50.987
I asked them to sit with us at the dinner,
fill in for my parents.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.557
Lex.

09:52.726 --> 09:56.787
I think it's great that you wanna
make them a big part of this, but...

09:57.264 --> 09:59.027
But what?

09:59.299 --> 10:02.860
Don't you think this might be the right
moment to reach out to your father?

10:04.237 --> 10:05.568
Helen.

10:05.739 --> 10:08.572
I'm touched that you
want us to reconcile.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.141
But it's not gonna happen.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.373
Besides...

10:12.879 --> 10:15.177
...the only family I need is you.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.500
I don't believe this.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.477
We should call the police.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.582
Is anything valuable missing?

11:02.095 --> 11:05.997
Gosh, I'm sorry to hear that, Helen.

11:06.166 --> 11:10.899
- They take anything important?
- The vial of blood I drew from Clark.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.074
Tell me why you
would even still have that.

11:15.242 --> 11:18.177
I thought I might need it someday,
in case he got sick again.

11:18.345 --> 11:22.179
It wasn't labeled. There's no way
anyone could connect it to Clark.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.381
Then why would anybody
wanna steal it?

11:24.551 --> 11:29.284
It looks like somebody just broke open the
refrigerator and took whatever was inside.

11:30.190 --> 11:34.126
The police think it may have been
junkies looking for drugs.

11:35.328 --> 11:38.991
Or maybe somebody who wanted
to make it look that way.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.098
Are you saying you think
that I staged this?

11:43.270 --> 11:45.465
We're the only ones who knew
about Clark's blood.

11:45.639 --> 11:48.073
- And you never told anybody else?
- Of course not.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.266
Not even the man
you're about to marry?

11:50.777 --> 11:52.472
Mr. Kent...

11:52.646 --> 11:54.841
Lex is not the man
you think he is.

11:55.182 --> 11:59.016
Considering that you're about to
spend the rest of your life with that man...

11:59.186 --> 12:01.620
...and what you know
about my family...

12:01.788 --> 12:04.256
...you had better be right.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.531
I don't think it's a good idea
that you seat Lana next to me.

12:17.704 --> 12:18.966
What happened?

12:20.040 --> 12:21.371
I wish I knew.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.203
Clark.

12:24.778 --> 12:27.338
None of us really
understands the fairer sex.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.283
It's why we're so
captivated by them.

12:36.823 --> 12:39.291
I went for it last night.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.791
- Don't tell me she shot you down.
- No.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.990
It was the opposite.

12:47.634 --> 12:50.330
It was like this perfect moment,
and then this morning...

12:50.504 --> 12:52.563
She wanted to pretend
it never happened.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.401
You've upped the stakes, Clark,
and she's scared.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.206
She figures if she folds now,
she'll cut her losses.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.441
We're meant to be together.
I've never been so sure about anything.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.347
Yeah, well, don't tell me, Clark.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.381
Tell her.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.798
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.172
Come on.

13:43.256 --> 13:46.157
- Lana, last night was a big deal for me.
- Clark.

13:46.326 --> 13:50.820
Look, you don't have to avoid calling me
if you don't feel the same way.

13:50.997 --> 13:54.023
No, it meant a lot to me too.

13:54.467 --> 13:59.928
Everything seemed so clear, but today
it just feels a lot more complicated.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.775
Is this about Chloe?

14:04.978 --> 14:09.005
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't worried about her...

14:09.182 --> 14:13.744
...but there are three friendships at stake
here, and I don't wanna risk losing ours.

14:13.920 --> 14:19.688
The friendship isn't gonna go anywhere.
It'll just become something better.

14:25.632 --> 14:30.092
And what happens down the road
if things don't work out?

14:31.571 --> 14:35.473
- Will our friendship survive that?
- I don't know.

14:37.210 --> 14:41.010
Lana, I've wanted this for so long,
I think it's worth taking the chance.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.788
The day is coming.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.116
Clark?

14:54.628 --> 14:56.425
Are you all right?

14:56.596 --> 14:59.190
The day is coming.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.558
Clark, what is it?

15:05.605 --> 15:07.232
I'm sorry, I have to go.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.369
The day is coming.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.983
The day is coming.
The day is coming.

15:17.150 --> 15:22.178
- What do you think it means?
- It's probably just delusional rambling.

15:24.391 --> 15:27.554
But your scans say his
brain activity is normal again.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.223
The day is coming.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.692
Does that look normal to you?

15:37.737 --> 15:39.534
The day is coming.
The day is coming...

15:39.706 --> 15:42.174
The cataracts, they're gone.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.572
They faded during
the course of a day.

15:44.744 --> 15:49.078
- How do you explain that?
- I can't.

15:49.783 --> 15:53.310
I know you want to see if he says
anything else, but for his own safety...

15:53.486 --> 15:56.478
...I need to sedate him.
- The day is coming! The day is...

16:01.962 --> 16:03.862
The day is coming.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.645
I think it says,
"The day is coming."

16:29.023 --> 16:34.484
- You learned how to read the symbols?
- No, just an educated guess.

16:34.662 --> 16:37.927
It's what Walden kept
saying before he escaped.

16:38.199 --> 16:40.224
I wonder how he wrote it.

16:40.401 --> 16:45.896
Apparently, he's developed the ability to
emit some kind of energy from his hands.

16:46.207 --> 16:50.906
I think maybe it has something to do with
whatever happened to him in the cave.

16:53.381 --> 16:55.815
Why are you telling me all this?

16:57.585 --> 16:59.450
You found him, Clark.

16:59.620 --> 17:02.885
Just wondering if you could shed
any more light on the situation.

17:03.224 --> 17:05.589
I've already told you
everything I know.

17:07.795 --> 17:09.455
These symbols...

17:09.630 --> 17:12.121
...they look like the one on your barn.

17:13.733 --> 17:17.032
Lex, I told you. I don't know
how to read this language.

17:18.239 --> 17:20.207
I believe you, Clark.

17:21.576 --> 17:23.771
Then what am I doing here?

17:23.944 --> 17:27.642
I thought, based on our
mutual interest in the cave...

17:27.815 --> 17:30.283
...we could solve this mystery together.

17:32.253 --> 17:35.222
I'm sorry, Lex.
I'm as mystified as you are.

18:41.122 --> 18:43.488
I know who you are.

18:49.497 --> 18:51.226
Hey, Helen.

18:52.066 --> 18:55.661
Are you planning a rehearsal
dinner or a peace summit?

18:55.836 --> 18:59.135
This whole wedding is starting
to feel just as political.

18:59.307 --> 19:01.537
It's hard to know
what side everybody's on.

19:03.177 --> 19:05.407
You're not having
second thoughts, are you?

19:07.048 --> 19:08.879
Sorry, l...

19:09.050 --> 19:14.078
- It's all gotten very complicated.
- Sounds kind of familiar.

19:14.889 --> 19:19.087
You wouldn't be talking about a tall,
dark, handsome best man, would you?

19:23.164 --> 19:27.362
If you knew that Lex was
keeping secrets from you...

19:27.535 --> 19:30.766
...but he was being truthful
about the important things like...

19:31.806 --> 19:34.570
Like the way he feels about you.

19:36.010 --> 19:37.534
Would that be enough?

19:38.946 --> 19:41.005
I guess you have to decide.

19:41.182 --> 19:45.278
Is the part of themselves that
they're willing to share with you...

19:45.453 --> 19:48.422
...better than not having
them in your life at all?

20:11.078 --> 20:13.740
You don't really think he's
hidden it in here, do you?

20:15.082 --> 20:19.246
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm talking about the valuable object...

20:19.420 --> 20:21.615
...Lex stole from your office.

20:21.789 --> 20:23.723
Lex would never steal from me.

20:24.959 --> 20:29.089
If you believe that, what are you doing
rummaging around in here while he's out?

20:29.430 --> 20:31.523
How do I know you didn't
break into my office?

20:31.699 --> 20:36.398
Oh, my. It seems I've antagonized
the lady of the house.

20:37.505 --> 20:40.941
Please, would you tell my son
I dropped by to offer my best wishes?

20:42.176 --> 20:43.507
Oh, no.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.645
That would be difficult,
wouldn't it?

20:45.813 --> 20:48.714
Because we'd have to explain
that we ran into each other...

20:48.883 --> 20:52.717
...when we were in here and
I caught you snooping and...

20:53.487 --> 20:56.479
Oh, that could get really messy.

20:56.657 --> 20:59.820
Especially with your
wedding day almost upon us.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.658
Get out.

21:08.202 --> 21:10.636
Can I ask you a question, Helen?

21:13.908 --> 21:15.933
Why are you marrying Lex?

21:16.877 --> 21:18.310
Because I love him.

21:29.156 --> 21:31.283
Dr. Walden?

21:31.459 --> 21:33.859
It's me, Clark Kent.

21:34.361 --> 21:36.329
Dr. Walden.

21:36.497 --> 21:38.556
Are you down here?

21:48.843 --> 21:51.403
Interesting, isn't it?

21:52.113 --> 21:54.479
- Mr. Luthor.
- That...

21:54.648 --> 21:58.414
...octagonal recess
in the wall, I mean.

21:58.586 --> 22:04.047
I once had what you might call
a keepsake that matched this.

22:04.291 --> 22:05.781
Exactly.

22:05.960 --> 22:09.589
Just disappeared from my office.

22:11.832 --> 22:15.666
It was that same day you rescued
your mother and me.

22:17.338 --> 22:19.272
What are you doing down here?

22:19.440 --> 22:22.773
I have taken over
conservatorship of the caves.

22:23.377 --> 22:26.642
- Didn't Lex tell you?
- No, he didn't.

22:27.848 --> 22:31.875
He just doesn't want to admit defeat,
and he's still fighting me on this.

22:32.052 --> 22:34.680
I ran into some of his
security people down here.

22:34.855 --> 22:38.814
They were looking for that doctor.
Dr...?

22:38.993 --> 22:40.358
Dr. Walden?

22:40.761 --> 22:42.729
Dr. Walden was obsessed
with these caves.

22:42.897 --> 22:46.264
Well, I could understand why.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.060
Look at this.

22:48.235 --> 22:50.669
These symbols...

22:51.305 --> 22:55.139
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
They are...

22:55.309 --> 22:58.142
Are they arranged in a different...

22:58.546 --> 23:01.276
...order than they were before?

23:02.149 --> 23:03.946
That's strange.

23:06.187 --> 23:08.587
Don't you think, Clark?

23:10.090 --> 23:11.648
It's all Kawatche to me.

23:14.662 --> 23:17.358
If you see Dr. Walden, be careful.

23:17.731 --> 23:19.892
He could be dangerous.

23:29.009 --> 23:30.943
I don't get it.

23:31.679 --> 23:35.274
First the refined kryptonite,
now the caves.

23:35.449 --> 23:36.780
What does Luthor want?

23:36.951 --> 23:39.317
I don't know, but I think
we have a bigger problem.

23:39.486 --> 23:43.752
Dr. Walden can read the Krypton language.
He wrote it on the ceiling at the hospital.

23:43.924 --> 23:47.690
- Do you think he's figured out your secret?
- Is that why you're so worried now?

23:47.861 --> 23:50.421
I'm not sure, but something's
going on in that cave.

23:50.598 --> 23:52.463
The symbols have changed.

23:52.933 --> 23:57.131
- What does it say now, son?
- "The day is coming...

23:57.304 --> 24:01.035
...when the last son will begin
his quest to rule the third planet."

24:01.842 --> 24:05.039
- Clark.
- Don't you see? I'm the last son.

24:09.483 --> 24:12.611
Why humiliate yourself
like this, Dad?

24:12.786 --> 24:15.482
When are you gonna accept
the fact that you're not invited?

24:15.656 --> 24:20.286
You know, Lex, I'm not here to grovel
for a place at your table.

24:20.461 --> 24:22.952
I wanted to tell you that...

24:23.297 --> 24:28.894
...your restraining order to keep me out of
the Kawatche caves has been rejected.

24:29.069 --> 24:30.866
Flat out.

24:31.171 --> 24:35.403
And you couldn't have had your lawyers
tell my lawyers that over the phone?

24:35.909 --> 24:37.774
It's curious, though...

24:37.945 --> 24:41.881
...your renewed interest seems to come
right on the heels of Dr. Walden's escape.

24:44.151 --> 24:47.177
And Clark Kent seems
to share your opinion.

24:47.354 --> 24:50.983
He was down there too,
looking for your linguist.

24:52.993 --> 24:54.722
Lex!

24:55.429 --> 24:57.590
- I did it, Lex.
- Dr. Walden.

24:59.767 --> 25:01.325
I finally read the wall.

25:02.836 --> 25:04.667
I know what it says.

25:04.838 --> 25:07.636
We'll talk all about it,
but first we need to get you help.

25:07.808 --> 25:10.003
- Let the man tell us.
- Stay out of this.

25:10.177 --> 25:12.168
The wall, doctor,
what does it say?

25:13.180 --> 25:16.206
"The last son will rule the planet."

25:20.187 --> 25:21.677
Don't you see?

25:21.855 --> 25:23.914
It's Clark Kent!

25:26.193 --> 25:28.718
- I think that's a pretty big leap.
- No.

25:28.896 --> 25:30.921
I've never seen
more clearly in my life.

25:32.299 --> 25:35.791
- I know exactly what has to be done.
- What is that, doctor?

25:38.539 --> 25:41.007
We have to kill Clark Kent.

25:41.975 --> 25:43.465
Before he destroys us all.

25:45.846 --> 25:47.609
Dr. Walden, you're confused.

26:10.071 --> 26:12.096
"Dear guests..."

26:12.440 --> 26:15.273
No, it's gotta be something else.

26:16.244 --> 26:18.144
"Friend..."
"Friends and family..."

26:18.312 --> 26:19.939
First line's always the hardest.

26:21.482 --> 26:23.882
- Hey, Chloe, what's up?
- Big news.

26:24.051 --> 26:25.780
Your friend Dr. Walden woke up.

26:27.154 --> 26:29.452
I wouldn't exactly call him
a friend of mine.

26:29.624 --> 26:34.493
I was just wondering if you wanted to come
out of retirement and do the story with me.

26:34.929 --> 26:37.921
Hey, I appreciate the offer,
but now really isn't a good time.

26:38.099 --> 26:40.932
I didn't mean right this second, Clark.

26:44.572 --> 26:46.972
I wish things could be like they were.

26:48.509 --> 26:49.771
Yeah, me too.

26:51.545 --> 26:54.207
I just feel like there's this
huge rift between us...

26:54.382 --> 26:57.977
...and no matter how hard I try,
I can't get back to you.

26:58.619 --> 27:01.645
We'll get there, Chloe.
It's just gonna take a little bit of time.

27:03.758 --> 27:05.953
Well, whatever happens,
let's just...

27:06.127 --> 27:08.618
Let's promise to be
honest with each other.

27:08.796 --> 27:13.597
I mean, you're a big boy, I'm a big girl.
I think we can handle it.

27:14.335 --> 27:16.667
As long as we tell the truth.

27:19.073 --> 27:21.268
Okay, well, I'd better get going.

27:21.442 --> 27:25.970
You have your rehearsal dinner,
and I have the Torch. So...

27:28.816 --> 27:31.080
Break a leg, Clark.

28:01.882 --> 28:03.349
Sorry I'm late.

28:03.517 --> 28:06.816
- Where have you been?
- Business crisis.

28:08.089 --> 28:09.579
Don't worry, I'm all yours now.

28:09.757 --> 28:11.486
I need a moment
with the best man.

28:11.959 --> 28:13.722
Okay.

28:16.097 --> 28:18.122
- Hello, Mrs. Kent.
- Everything is beautiful.

28:18.299 --> 28:19.891
Thank you. Thank you very much.

28:20.067 --> 28:21.728
- Hello, Lex.
- Hey.

28:21.902 --> 28:25.599
- Mind if I have a word with your son?
- No, go right ahead.

28:26.674 --> 28:31.407
- Is everything all right?
- Dr. Walden paid me a visit.

28:31.879 --> 28:34.074
Nobody was hurt.

28:34.248 --> 28:36.739
He's on his way back to the hospital.

28:36.917 --> 28:40.216
- Well, that's good news.
- Clark, he was ranting about you.

28:41.422 --> 28:45.916
- What'd he say?
- That the writing on the cave wall says...

28:46.093 --> 28:47.685
...you're going to rule the world.

28:47.862 --> 28:49.955
I'm gonna rule the world?

28:50.131 --> 28:52.656
- He's obviously nuts.
- Of course he is.

28:52.833 --> 28:55.700
Unfortunately, my father was there.
He heard the whole thing.

28:55.870 --> 28:57.929
He didn't believe him, did he?

28:58.205 --> 29:01.538
He quoted one of his
favorite Elizabethan poets.

29:01.709 --> 29:05.805
Twixt truth and madness lies
But a sliver of a stream

29:06.847 --> 29:09.247
He's not just gonna let this drop.

29:09.583 --> 29:11.278
I thought I'd warn you.

29:20.694 --> 29:24.425
I certainly do admire
your work ethic, Miss Sullivan.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.630
- Late at night, here you are, still at it.
- Yeah.

29:30.805 --> 29:33.467
Well, I wasn't invited
to the rehearsal dinner, so...

29:33.641 --> 29:36.542
Yes, we have a lot in common.

29:37.178 --> 29:42.275
I spoke to the managing editor
of the Daily Planet. It's all set.

29:42.450 --> 29:48.218
A weekly column on current affairs
from the young person's perspective.

29:50.958 --> 29:52.619
I don't know how to thank you.

29:53.594 --> 29:57.860
Nurturing a promising
young talent is a reward in itself.

29:58.032 --> 30:00.193
And I've got your first assignment.

30:02.269 --> 30:06.501
A complete investigative
profile of Clark Kent.

30:07.475 --> 30:12.174
What possible interest could the Daily
Planet have in a farm boy from Smallville?

30:12.413 --> 30:16.782
This isn't for the Daily Planet. They'll
be in touch with you. No, this is for me.

30:16.984 --> 30:22.149
Just combine it with any research
about his family you already have.

30:30.764 --> 30:33.824
I blew off my journalistic skepticism...

30:34.001 --> 30:39.064
...and allowed myself to actually believe
that you were interested in just helping me.

30:40.407 --> 30:44.138
You're playing in the real world now,
Miss Sullivan.

30:44.311 --> 30:47.178
You have to give to get.

30:47.882 --> 30:52.376
Mr. Luthor. I don't know
what your interest is in Clark...

30:52.553 --> 30:57.149
...but you can take the job offer and shove
it down your thousand-dollar pants.

30:59.026 --> 31:02.120
Clark's very lucky
to have a friend like you.

31:02.296 --> 31:04.594
All that integrity.

31:11.138 --> 31:15.336
I wonder, though, if he had to make
a choice, would he sacrifice his dream...

31:15.509 --> 31:17.500
...out of loyalty to you?

31:36.597 --> 31:38.758
Any change?

31:39.700 --> 31:42.294
No, he'll be out for hours.

32:00.354 --> 32:03.118
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

32:05.059 --> 32:08.688
I think Lex picked me to be
the best man because he knew...

32:08.862 --> 32:12.298
...how comfortable I was
speaking in front of people.

32:16.203 --> 32:20.264
I've been looking through every book
from Socrates to Shakespeare...

32:20.441 --> 32:23.205
...trying to find someone
who can put into words the way...

32:23.377 --> 32:26.369
...Lex and Helen
feel about each other.

32:27.214 --> 32:29.478
But what I realized is,
there are no words for it.

32:31.452 --> 32:33.784
That when you have it,
you trust it.

32:34.154 --> 32:36.145
You believe in it.

32:37.658 --> 32:39.023
Take a chance on it.

32:40.894 --> 32:44.625
You're willing to sacrifice
anything to keep it.

32:44.965 --> 32:46.990
No matter what the cost.

32:52.172 --> 32:54.868
- To Helen and Lex.
- To Helen and Lex.

33:04.285 --> 33:05.718
Thanks.

33:10.024 --> 33:13.425
- Clark, are you all right?
- Yeah...

33:14.028 --> 33:16.394
...I just gotta get some air.

33:28.175 --> 33:29.699
- Clark.
- Son.

33:29.877 --> 33:31.606
- What's the matter?
- It's the key.

33:31.779 --> 33:34.646
There's something wrong at home.
I have to go.

33:53.033 --> 33:55.263
I came looking for you.

33:59.640 --> 34:01.039
And I found the proof.

34:04.578 --> 34:06.205
You...

34:06.513 --> 34:08.036
...are the one.

34:08.415 --> 34:10.349
Dr. Walden, listen to me.

34:10.516 --> 34:13.610
- You need help.
- No.

34:13.786 --> 34:15.254
You need to die.

34:36.510 --> 34:37.976
Dr. Walden...

34:44.717 --> 34:46.811
Dr. Walden, no!

35:07.275 --> 35:11.712
- Doctor, you're making a mistake.
- No, I'm not. I'm doing this for mankind.

35:46.815 --> 35:48.908
With the exception of Clark's migraine...

35:49.084 --> 35:52.281
...I thought the evening
was mercifully uneventful.

35:59.027 --> 36:00.790
What's wrong?

36:01.429 --> 36:02.896
Nothing.

36:04.399 --> 36:10.395
If we're gonna spend our lives together,
we need to be honest with each other.

36:10.572 --> 36:13.040
You're always saying that.

36:18.313 --> 36:21.544
I found a file on Mrs. Kent
in your bookshelf.

36:21.716 --> 36:24.651
It contained confidential
medical records.

36:25.587 --> 36:27.214
From my office.

36:27.789 --> 36:32.488
I got that from a Disease Control agent
who was investigating Mrs. Kent's case.

36:32.661 --> 36:34.356
You mean you bribed someone for it.

36:35.997 --> 36:37.897
I've told you...

36:38.066 --> 36:43.129
...the Kents are very important to me.
I was concerned about Martha's health.

36:46.474 --> 36:51.377
- What were you looking for, anyway?
- Something that was stolen from my office.

36:51.980 --> 36:54.744
Do you think I was involved
in the break-in?

36:56.318 --> 36:58.047
Please tell me you weren't.

37:02.724 --> 37:07.184
If you really believe I'm capable
of that kind of deceit...

37:08.863 --> 37:11.263
...maybe you
shouldn't be marrying me.

37:15.603 --> 37:17.036
Maybe you're right.

38:29.411 --> 38:31.879
I had to pry it from his hand.

38:32.046 --> 38:34.514
It wasn't your fault, Clark.

38:34.682 --> 38:37.116
The man tried to kill you.
He was delusional.

38:37.285 --> 38:42.313
Even the sheriff agreed, son.
Walden was responsible for his own death.

38:42.690 --> 38:44.555
What if he was right?

38:45.860 --> 38:49.887
- What if I am a threat to mankind?
- I'll never believe that.

38:50.064 --> 38:51.463
And neither should you.

38:52.267 --> 38:56.465
And what does it mean? The day is coming
when I'll begin my quest to rule?

38:56.638 --> 38:58.572
We don't know, son.

38:59.174 --> 39:01.301
But when and if that day does come...

39:01.476 --> 39:05.537
...your mother and I both know
that you'll do the right thing.

39:11.419 --> 39:15.116
His entire body's been burned
beyond recognition.

39:15.690 --> 39:17.715
But look.

39:18.993 --> 39:24.488
Whatever he was holding here,
it protected the skin it was covering.

39:28.236 --> 39:30.204
I've never seen anything like this.

39:37.779 --> 39:39.872
Send it to me.

39:42.417 --> 39:44.715
Send you what?

39:47.055 --> 39:49.080
The hand.

40:04.806 --> 40:08.264
I never got a chance to tell you
how beautiful you look tonight.

40:08.743 --> 40:10.938
Clark, you scared me.

40:11.713 --> 40:13.738
Surprised me.

40:14.883 --> 40:18.478
Just wanted to see you.
Kind of ran out on dinner.

40:22.123 --> 40:24.557
I thought your toast
was really beautiful.

40:27.996 --> 40:30.590
I had a lot of inspiration.

40:33.434 --> 40:36.801
Sorry I've been so confused about us.

40:37.238 --> 40:39.297
It's just...

40:39.807 --> 40:41.502
I'm scared.

40:42.744 --> 40:44.177
So am I.

40:45.146 --> 40:47.341
You have so many secrets in your life.

40:48.883 --> 40:50.578
I know.

40:53.621 --> 40:56.613
I just don't want my feelings
for you to be one of them.

40:57.425 --> 40:59.484
Neither do I.

42:24.312 --> 42:27.213
Kal-El, it is time.

42:35.089 --> 42:38.490
Kal-El, it is time.
