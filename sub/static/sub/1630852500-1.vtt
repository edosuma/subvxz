00:02.000 --> 00:06.960
This programme contains some
strong language and adult humour

00:06.960 --> 00:09.520
Any second now.
You a JFK fan, Steven?

00:09.520 --> 00:12.440
You have any strong opinions
about his assassination? No.

00:12.440 --> 00:15.680
Though I do know, due to
the actions of one skinny loser,

00:15.680 --> 00:19.280
I'm here yet again voicing another
bullshit conspiracy theory.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.680
Well, according to this
Mirrornek guy, it was his wife.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.200
I couldn't give two fucks.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.640
How many words is this?

00:24.640 --> 00:27.040
Hello, Steven, this is
Clem Fandango, can you hear me?

00:27.040 --> 00:28.920
How many words, Clem Fandango?

00:28.920 --> 00:30.560
About 100,000 words.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.080
Phew, that's a lot of bullshit.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.800
He's very angry today. Yeah.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.320
What's with this laptop?

00:36.320 --> 00:38.040
He's not going to join us, is he?
Is he?

00:38.040 --> 00:40.360
Sorry to interrupt, Steven,
Sola Mirrornek is about

00:40.360 --> 00:41.760
to join us from Dallas. Why?

00:41.760 --> 00:43.600
Just wants to keep an eye on things.

00:43.600 --> 00:47.000
He's going to appear
on the laptop in front of you.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.200
He should be there now. Yes.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.360
Steven Toast, meet Sola.
Yeah, hello.

00:52.360 --> 00:55.840
What? Hello, Sola, this is
Clem Fandango, can you hear me?

00:55.840 --> 00:58.320
Yes, I can hear you, Clem Fandango.

00:58.320 --> 01:00.160
Brilliant. Let's start.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.440
In your own time, Steven.

01:05.720 --> 01:06.760
The...

01:06.760 --> 01:08.320
All right, hold it, hold it.

01:08.320 --> 01:11.800
I just need to stop you there.
No problem. What is it, Sola?

01:11.800 --> 01:13.800
Did he say <i>duh?</i>

01:13.800 --> 01:17.200
No, he didn't. He said <i>the.</i>

01:17.200 --> 01:20.200
Huh. Sounded to me like duh.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.440
I don't know,
maybe it's his English accent.

01:22.440 --> 01:26.160
And can I also say, just for the record,
the idea of an English actor

01:26.160 --> 01:29.400
reading this came from my publisher,
not from me.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.960
I need to make that totally clear,
I hated the idea.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.960
OK, still rolling.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.800
The idea... You know what?

01:40.800 --> 01:45.120
Now that I hear it,
I'm not so sure.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.880
I never really liked that
first sentence, I might do a...

01:47.880 --> 01:49.160
I might do a quick rewrite.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.720
This is bullshit.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.080
I lost my train of thought.

01:56.720 --> 01:57.800
Forget it, forget it.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.080
It's probably OK as it is,
keep going.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.120
Action.

02:02.240 --> 02:06.240
The idea that John F Kennedy...
OK, OK, OK.

02:06.240 --> 02:07.920
Alarm bells.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.520
There's a touch of cynicism in his voice.
You guys hear that too?

02:10.520 --> 02:12.520
Cynicism?
And another thing,

02:12.520 --> 02:15.600
I heard what you said about Oswald
being a lone assassin.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.760
Only an asshole would believe that!

02:17.760 --> 02:21.880
So, if you don't mind, I'd rather
you kept your personal prejudices

02:21.880 --> 02:24.200
to yourself, you got that?

02:24.200 --> 02:26.560
OK, Steven,
you want to make a note of that?

02:26.560 --> 02:28.280
Yeah, I'll make a note of that.

02:30.560 --> 02:34.680
The idea that John F Kennedy was
killed by a single assassin

02:34.680 --> 02:38.720
is not only an impossibility,
it's also bullshit.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.360
Wait a second, wait a second...

02:40.360 --> 02:42.760
are you serious,
is this guy a real actor?

03:19.600 --> 03:21.080
There, there.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.720
I should hate him.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.960
But actually, I miss him terribly!

03:28.560 --> 03:31.360
Have another tissue, Sue.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.000
Won't you run out?

03:33.000 --> 03:36.480
I always have lots of tissues
for distressed clients.

03:40.640 --> 03:41.880
What's the matter with her?

03:41.880 --> 03:46.800
Ah, Toast, this is Sue Pipkins,
she's just joined the agency.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.360
Why is she weeping?
Her husband left her.

03:49.360 --> 03:52.600
What, today? Six weeks ago.

03:52.600 --> 03:56.080
Six weeks ago?
Are you fucking kidding? Is that it?

03:56.080 --> 03:58.120
You could have got
remarried in that time.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.560
To be honest, I'm not surprised
your husband left you

04:00.560 --> 04:01.800
with all this blubbering.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.720
Shut up, Toast.

04:03.720 --> 04:06.040
Oh, I'm so sorry, Sue!

04:06.040 --> 04:07.600
Sorry, Sue.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.080
Really, Toast!

04:09.080 --> 04:13.360
Why are you so angry all the time?

04:13.360 --> 04:14.800
What do you want, Jane?

04:14.800 --> 04:17.080
I have tremendous news.

04:17.080 --> 04:21.440
I finally heard back
from the Sam Mendes people. Who?

04:21.440 --> 04:24.400
Sam Mendes, famous film director.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.760
And?

04:25.760 --> 04:29.920
I'm afraid you didn't get the part
of the agoraphobic fighter pilot.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.480
That audition was
15 years ago, Jane.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.520
But I've had another enquiry
about you...

04:35.520 --> 04:38.480
more reality TV,
could be a money-spinner.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.800
Never again. Why not?

04:50.920 --> 04:52.560
Shit.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.400
Broken neck.

04:59.160 --> 05:02.760
Ah, yes. Strictly no dancing.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.840
Strictly Come Dancing, Jane.

05:05.840 --> 05:09.280
What kind of dancing show would it
be without any dancing on it?

05:09.280 --> 05:13.040
I've no idea. To be honest, I'll not
sure why it's called Come Dancing.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.080
Hopefully it's nothing to do with
the Strictly curse, what?

05:16.080 --> 05:17.400
May I remind you, Toast,

05:17.400 --> 05:20.520
that the cash you earned from
Strictly prevented you

05:20.520 --> 05:24.280
from gripping the oak and spending
two years at Her Majesty's,

05:24.280 --> 05:25.960
and what thanks do I get?

05:25.960 --> 05:28.280
Do you know what you are, Toast?

05:28.280 --> 05:31.160
You're a BLEEP.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.720
Jane!

05:32.720 --> 05:34.120
No other word for it, I'm afraid.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.400
Yes?

05:38.400 --> 05:40.640
Great!

05:40.640 --> 05:42.000
Brilliant news!

05:42.000 --> 05:44.560
I didn't want to say anything
until it'd been confirmed,

05:44.560 --> 05:46.520
and now it has been. What has?

05:46.520 --> 05:48.240
Do you remember a man telling you

05:48.240 --> 05:51.720
to keep your voice down
in Tesco's last week?

05:51.720 --> 05:54.240
Yes, some soppy Yank carrying
a small dog.

05:54.240 --> 05:57.560
That soppy yank, as you call him,
was Neil Doubledecker,

05:57.560 --> 06:01.520
who happens to be a top Hollywood
producer. Who cares?

06:01.520 --> 06:05.520
All these British actors obsessed
with working in America.

06:05.520 --> 06:08.240
If you're in a shit show,
it doesn't matter where you film it,

06:08.240 --> 06:10.160
you may as well be in your own bed.

06:10.160 --> 06:14.760
Neil Doubledecker is interested in
you for a role in his new movie.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.360
Oh, right. So when can I meet
this Doubledecker?

06:18.360 --> 06:20.840
<i>DOOB-ledecker. </i>He thinks you're
absolutely brilliant.

06:20.840 --> 06:24.640
I showed him your showreel, he was
literally bowled over. Fantastic.

06:24.640 --> 06:28.160
He thinks you're the best actor
he's ever seen anywhere,

06:28.160 --> 06:30.920
and that if you were to
appear in one of his films,

06:30.920 --> 06:35.240
you could almost certainly win
a Critics' Choice Award.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.440
Well, that sounds great.
It does, doesn't it?

06:37.440 --> 06:40.560
It's utterly marvellous!
Your big break at last, Toast.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.520
At last! Yeah!

06:42.520 --> 06:44.960
There is, however,
one small obstacle in the way,

06:44.960 --> 06:47.640
there's another actor who
Doubledecker thinks is

06:47.640 --> 06:48.920
equally as good as you.

06:48.920 --> 06:52.560
In fact, he thinks this actor may be
slightly better. Ugh, no.

06:52.560 --> 06:56.160
He has to choose between you and...

06:59.920 --> 07:00.960
Who?!

07:18.960 --> 07:21.760
Ray bloody Purchase?!

07:21.760 --> 07:24.400
Never mind.
Let's assume you'll get the gig.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.400
This could actually be an opportune
time for you

07:26.400 --> 07:28.000
to depart to the US of A.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.640
Talking of Americans,

07:29.640 --> 07:32.840
how did you get on with that author,
Sola Mirrornek?

07:32.840 --> 07:34.760
I'll tell you how I got on with him,

07:34.760 --> 07:38.320
that bastard had the audacity to ask
whether I was a professional actor.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.000
Well, are you? What?!

07:40.000 --> 07:43.280
Look, Toast,
it's between you and Purchase.

07:43.280 --> 07:46.040
You'd better make sure you do
a brilliant audition.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.480
Audition?!

08:22.880 --> 08:27.600
He is terribly, terribly angry,
all the time.

08:27.600 --> 08:30.520
Yes, Jane,
he really is terribly angry.

08:30.520 --> 08:33.000
Maybe we should organise some
kind of intervention?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.800
I'm actually thinking I may
send him to a doctor.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.800
Yes, India?
Toast's on his way up. Ugh.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.000
He's here, Ed. Better hang up.

08:46.520 --> 08:47.680
Ah, Toast.

08:50.360 --> 08:54.000
Look, Toast, I'll come straight
to the pointâ€”do you think,

08:54.000 --> 08:59.200
both as an actor and a human being,
you've turned into an angry

08:59.200 --> 09:02.240
and unreasonable piece of shit?

09:02.240 --> 09:04.600
That's a bit strong, isn't it, Jane?

09:04.600 --> 09:08.200
Your language really has become
increasingly fruity.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.080
I'm no more angry than
I've ever been.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.960
Several people have mentioned it.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.200
Like who? Idris Elba.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.440
Who?

09:15.440 --> 09:18.080
Your peculiar flatmate, Ed.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.160
And there's an article about
it in The Stage.

09:22.160 --> 09:25.200
Luckily, it's The Stage
and only actors read that,

09:25.200 --> 09:27.680
in the way that only gardeners
read The Garden.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.360
The Guardian.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.240
No, The Garden, gardening magazine.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.200
Look, Toast, I've been thinking,

09:34.200 --> 09:36.600
I really think
you need to see a doctor.

09:36.600 --> 09:37.840
I don't trust doctors.

09:37.840 --> 09:41.200
Last time I had a bad back,
he told me to join a choir. He what?

09:41.200 --> 09:44.520
The doctor told me
I should go to choir practicer.

09:44.520 --> 09:47.720
Well, maybe he meant a chiropractor?

09:47.720 --> 09:50.240
A what?! Something to do with backs.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.880
Look, Toast, I'm going
to book you the appointment.

09:52.880 --> 09:55.280
I just need to get you through
this audition tomorrow.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.720
Be very calm, very polite. Yes.

09:57.720 --> 10:01.080
You keep that famous Toast anger
under control, alrighty?

10:03.200 --> 10:04.240
Yes?

10:06.160 --> 10:07.560
Thanks for letting me know.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.120
What's the matter with you, Jane?

10:15.120 --> 10:17.960
You've got a face like a slapped arse.
Bad news, I'm afraid.

10:17.960 --> 10:21.080
The producer's just offered the role
to Ray Purchase. What?!

10:21.080 --> 10:23.600
Apparently Ray went in there,
did his best Cary Grant,

10:23.600 --> 10:25.960
charmed them all,
got offered the job on the spot.

10:25.960 --> 10:29.160
Perhaps Doubledecker
knows about your temper?

10:53.080 --> 10:55.200
<i>â™ª Ray... â™ª</i>

10:55.200 --> 10:57.800
Hello, George. Francis, how's life?

10:57.800 --> 10:59.440
Ugh, you're kidding.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.040
Just the usual, please.

11:01.040 --> 11:04.120
Hold back on the water,
I know what you're like.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.880
Oh.

11:05.880 --> 11:09.160
Sorry, Toast,
I didn't notice you there.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.360
I was just about to phone you,
as it happens.

11:12.760 --> 11:16.200
Bad luck, losing out on that
career-changing Hollywood movie gig.

11:22.400 --> 11:26.160
The word is you lost out

11:26.160 --> 11:29.320
because they heard you have a
bit of an anger issue.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.080
Anyway.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.360
No hard feelings.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.560
And don't worry about
that 50 you owe me,

11:40.560 --> 11:42.240
whenever you've got it, it's fine.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.480
In fact, look, here's another 50.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.560
I haven't been around for a while,
Toast, I expect you've noticed.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.520
No.

11:55.520 --> 11:59.320
In fact, something really
serious happened.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.840
I reached...

12:02.560 --> 12:04.040
...peak anger.

12:04.040 --> 12:05.320
Peak anger?

12:05.320 --> 12:07.560
Yes, peak anger.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.520
I figured I should do
something about it

12:09.520 --> 12:13.040
so I booked myself into this
countryside retreat.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.600
Yoga, meditation,
that kind of thing. Ha!

12:15.600 --> 12:18.880
Run by a fantastic chap
called Des Wigwam.

12:18.880 --> 12:22.760
Who specialises in anger management.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.040
Yeah, I'll bet.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.600
Smashing guy, super people there.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.400
Anyway, now I feel...

12:30.080 --> 12:32.200
...not angry any more.

12:32.200 --> 12:35.920
I'm a whole new <i>Ray Purchase.</i>

12:35.920 --> 12:38.200
Why are you doing quotation marks
with your fingers?

12:38.200 --> 12:39.320
You are Ray Purchase.

12:42.520 --> 12:47.120
I suppose I'm the new <i>improved
</i>Ray Purchase. Spare me.

12:47.120 --> 12:50.400
Toast, after what happened,

12:50.400 --> 12:53.360
I think you should go and
see this Wigwam guy.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.360
Here, look, I'll give you his card.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.520
I feel... great.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.080
I feel terrible.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.120
Your name looks familiar.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.200
Do you ever get confused with...?

13:09.200 --> 13:10.440
Dr Harold Shipman?

13:10.440 --> 13:13.000
Thankfully, I'm not him.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.880
No, luckily I dodged a bullet
on that front. My name's Shitman.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.160
Dr Harold Shitman.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.520
Please take a seat.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.840
Your blood pressure's dangerously high,
you're not breathing freely

13:25.840 --> 13:27.800
and there's a serious risk
of heart failure.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.040
I'm not a doctor,
what does all that mean?

13:30.040 --> 13:32.280
It means you need
to change your lifestyle.

13:32.280 --> 13:33.640
You're an actor, aren't you?

13:33.640 --> 13:37.520
I saw the piece in The Stage about
you being very angry.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.520
I thought only...
Actors read that?

13:39.520 --> 13:42.720
The way only doctors read
The Doctor's Surgery?

13:42.720 --> 13:45.680
Well, I'm an actor and a doctor. Oh.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.880
There's a place in the country
people go to,

13:47.880 --> 13:49.560
run by a smashing chap called...

13:49.560 --> 13:52.080
Les Tepee? No. Des Wigwam.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.640
That's what I meant.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.360
Let me give you his card.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.480
He said my blood pressure is
dangerously high,

14:02.480 --> 14:06.960
I'm not breathing freely and there's
a high risk of heart failure.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.840
I'm not a doctor,
what does all that mean?

14:08.840 --> 14:10.720
It's not good, apparently.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.040
I have an idea, Toast.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.240
Something that might interest you.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.800
Well, she looks charming enough

14:18.800 --> 14:22.680
but I fear I may come a cropper
with the old dicky ticker.

14:22.680 --> 14:25.800
No, there is another place people
keep telling me about,

14:25.800 --> 14:30.880
an anger management unit
run by a chap called Chris Marquee.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.600
Or was it Rob Scout Hut?
Something like that.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.680
Do you mean Des Wigwam? That's it.

14:35.680 --> 14:38.600
I've heard he's very good.
You should go there, Toast.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.920
You've been on edge a lot lately.
Yeah, I have.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.080
Who the fuck is that?

14:44.080 --> 14:47.480
And what kind of arsehole would
call now, when we're having our tea?

14:47.480 --> 14:48.880
Answer me that?

14:48.880 --> 14:50.760
You can't, Ed, can you? You can't!

14:55.800 --> 14:57.360
Looks like peak anger.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.000
I think I need help.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.480
How far is this bloody place?

15:24.680 --> 15:28.040
Bloody situation this is,
I don't even want to bloody be here.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.040
That was me, just two years ago.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.240
And this is me today.

15:38.720 --> 15:43.080
That's what my anger
led me to, alcohol.

15:43.080 --> 15:44.840
Homelessness.

15:44.840 --> 15:47.400
A shitty attitude.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.440
But I turned my life around.

15:51.720 --> 15:52.760
And you can too.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.040
People ask me,
<i>"Why, Des, why?"</i>

15:57.040 --> 15:58.800
I say, <i>"Who?"</i>

15:58.800 --> 16:00.280
They say, <i>"What?"</i>

16:00.280 --> 16:02.720
Oh, I don't believe it. What?

16:02.720 --> 16:06.480
That's Steven Toast,
he was incredibly rude to me. Why?

16:06.480 --> 16:08.480
My husband had just left me,

16:08.480 --> 16:10.520
so I had a breakdown,

16:10.520 --> 16:13.720
Toast was totally unsympathetic.

16:13.720 --> 16:17.360
I read he was one of the most angry
people in show business.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.160
A real piece of shit.

16:19.160 --> 16:23.120
OK. For the first exercise today,

16:23.120 --> 16:26.040
I'd like you all
to just walk around the room.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.640
Oh, God.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.280
Come on, start walking.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.320
Nice and slow.

16:32.320 --> 16:34.840
Very good, very good.

16:34.840 --> 16:37.360
OK, everybody, stop.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.640
Look at the person closest to you.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.560
Look closely at this person.

16:45.320 --> 16:48.600
How does he or she make you feel?

16:49.640 --> 16:50.960
What do you think?

16:52.280 --> 16:53.320
Steven?

16:55.840 --> 16:57.840
Oh, erm...

16:57.840 --> 17:00.120
I feel nothing but utter contempt.

17:01.560 --> 17:04.680
Disgust, horror, hatred,

17:04.680 --> 17:07.240
even looking at her makes me
feel physically sick.

17:08.800 --> 17:12.080
OK, don't say the words out loud.

17:12.080 --> 17:13.520
Right.

17:13.520 --> 17:15.800
How do you feel about that, Sue?

17:20.800 --> 17:22.600
Shit.

17:22.600 --> 17:23.880
OK.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.800
That didn't go according to plan.

17:26.800 --> 17:27.880
It's early days.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.240
Right, Steven?

18:39.960 --> 18:45.200
I can honestly say I I've never felt
less angry in my entire life.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.080
It took a while with you, Toast.

18:47.080 --> 18:50.760
You were a particularly difficult case,
but we got there in the end.

18:50.760 --> 18:54.360
Well, I have to thank you.
Thank you, Des Wigwam.

18:54.360 --> 18:59.360
It's what we do. You see,
we close down all your emotions.

18:59.360 --> 19:03.360
You'll never get angry again.
But neither will you feel anything else.

19:03.360 --> 19:08.120
Happiness, relief, satisfaction,
love, contentment, sorrow or pain.

19:08.120 --> 19:10.320
Well, you kept that quiet. Did I?

19:10.320 --> 19:12.040
Well, you must be furious with me.

19:13.160 --> 19:15.760
No, I feel absolutely nothing.

19:15.760 --> 19:16.800
Great.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.400
You are now anger-free.

19:19.600 --> 19:24.520
Just one final thingâ€”you will
feel copious amounts of guilt.

19:24.520 --> 19:27.520
Well, it's interesting you
say that, the first thing I'll do

19:27.520 --> 19:30.480
when I get home is I'm going to
apologise to every single person

19:30.480 --> 19:32.200
I've ever been rude to.

19:33.360 --> 19:34.400
Good luck, Toast.

20:02.680 --> 20:05.280
I've forgotten my case.
Yeah, it's just there.

20:05.280 --> 20:06.720
Annoyed?

20:06.720 --> 20:08.720
Not at all. Great.

20:16.360 --> 20:19.480
The first person I'm going to
apologise to is Purchase.

20:19.480 --> 20:22.240
Now, I know we've had our
differences in the past but I happen

20:22.240 --> 20:26.640
to think he's an all-right guy
and I'm sure the feeling's mutual.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.640
You'll see.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.760
I'm obviously going to be
very famous!

20:30.760 --> 20:32.960
And make lots and lots of money!

20:38.880 --> 20:42.840
Darling, I'm in a particularly
good mood.

20:42.840 --> 20:45.240
What's say we spend the afternoon...

20:48.520 --> 20:50.400
Oh, not now, Ray.

20:57.160 --> 20:58.240
Purchase.

20:58.240 --> 21:01.240
Hi, Ray, me old pal, it's Toast.

21:01.240 --> 21:05.120
Yes, I'd like to apologise for being
rude to you over the years and

21:05.120 --> 21:09.360
not to mention, feeling extremely
guilty for making love to your wife.

21:09.360 --> 21:12.360
In your bed, sometimes
when you've been in the house

21:12.360 --> 21:14.440
and sometimes
when you've been in the bed.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.760
Every week for the past 20 years.

21:16.760 --> 21:20.520
So, sorry chap, and all the best!
Ha!

21:26.160 --> 21:27.560
What's the matter, Ray?

21:27.560 --> 21:29.080
<i>â™ª Ray... â™ª</i>

21:29.080 --> 21:34.240
Toast said he's been making
love to you

21:34.240 --> 21:35.600
in our bed

21:35.600 --> 21:38.600
every week for the last 20 years.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.240
Really?

21:40.240 --> 21:43.040
Hmm. I don't remember that.

21:43.040 --> 21:46.000
He's probably mistaken you
for someone else.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.160
I know you're completely innocent,
my darling.

21:49.160 --> 21:51.640
But on the off chance that he
is telling the truth...

21:53.560 --> 21:55.680
...I need to teach Toast a lesson!

21:59.240 --> 22:02.360
Oh, honestly, Ray, you should be
in a terrific mood after being

22:02.360 --> 22:04.360
offered a role in that
Hollywood movie.

22:04.360 --> 22:07.320
But you look like you're suddenly
getting angry again.

22:07.320 --> 22:10.040
I wonder if there's anything about
it in the small print?

22:10.040 --> 22:12.280
Oh, there it is.

22:13.520 --> 22:16.120
In tiny, tiny letters,

22:16.120 --> 22:18.360
<i>"Normal emotions may return if the</i>

22:18.360 --> 22:22.440
<i>patient is reminded of a previous
trauma or hears some bad news".</i>

22:24.560 --> 22:26.200
I'm going out!

22:37.400 --> 22:41.000
So, Jane, I've decided to meet lots
of people in the Colonial later.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.360
I'm going to apologise to every
man Jack and woman Jack

22:44.360 --> 22:46.600
of them individually.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.840
I'm here, Toast.

22:48.840 --> 22:49.920
Oh, yes.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.560
That should cover it. Thanks, Toast.

22:54.560 --> 22:56.000
Sorry for everything, Ian.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.080
Now for this lot.

22:59.680 --> 23:03.280
I say, thank you all for coming.

23:03.280 --> 23:09.560
I owe each one of you a sincere
apology for my anger over the years.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.320
I'm actually getting
quite emotional.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.040
Keep it together, Toast.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.960
You're making a tomfool
of yourself.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.640
Yes, you're right, Blair.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.920
By the way, Toast, you owe me Â£200.

23:23.320 --> 23:27.560
Well, I've given all my cash to Ian,
to pay my bar tab.

23:27.560 --> 23:29.680
Bar tab?!

23:29.680 --> 23:32.960
Toast, the only reason all of us
are here tonight

23:32.960 --> 23:35.960
in this bugger house is
because we thought you

23:35.960 --> 23:38.000
were going to repay our loans.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.120
That's the only reason we're here.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.120
Now, what say you, sir?

23:51.000 --> 23:52.040
Good Lord.

23:54.080 --> 23:55.360
You'll be lucky.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.360
By my reckoning,

23:57.360 --> 24:01.840
I'd say I'm the only man in this
room that owes you, Toast.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.320
This.

24:03.320 --> 24:05.520
It's for making love to my wife

24:05.520 --> 24:06.880
in my bed,

24:06.880 --> 24:08.960
sometimes when I was in the house,

24:08.960 --> 24:11.800
actually, sometimes
even when I was in the bed!

24:11.800 --> 24:13.280
For the last 20...

24:16.200 --> 24:18.880
Oh, yeah! Come on, Purchase,
ruck in there!

24:18.880 --> 24:19.920
Knock him out!

24:22.600 --> 24:24.520
What have you got, Toast?

24:24.520 --> 24:25.680
Oh, my goodness.

24:29.520 --> 24:30.560
Purchase!

24:32.040 --> 24:33.360
Come on, Purchase!

24:37.920 --> 24:40.880
All right, gentlemen,
Â£20 on the man in the moustache.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.000
God, not in the knackers.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.360
Oh, my giddy Aunt Sally!

25:07.360 --> 25:09.640
That'll teach you,
Ray bloody Purchase.

25:12.200 --> 25:13.560
Champagne, sir?

25:13.560 --> 25:16.320
It's an 1841 Veuve Clicquot.

25:16.320 --> 25:17.720
I'll bet it is!

25:17.720 --> 25:19.160
There you go, sir.

25:23.640 --> 25:26.200
Jane? I'm safely on the plane.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.840
Away from the baying mob.

25:28.840 --> 25:31.480
Can you believe they only turned up
to collect money off me?

25:31.480 --> 25:33.840
Ha! Saved in the nick of time.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.920
Now, let me give you some more
details about the terrific

25:36.920 --> 25:38.800
stroke of luck you've had.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.080
With Purchase now
out of the picture,

25:41.080 --> 25:44.280
I immediately contacted Doubledecker
to say you were still

25:44.280 --> 25:45.520
very much available.

25:45.520 --> 25:48.800
He said yes immediately,
they're even paying for your flight.

25:48.800 --> 25:52.680
Ha! Thank God for Doubledecker.
<i>DOOB-ledecker.</i>

25:52.680 --> 25:57.120
And hooray for Hollywood,
you're going to Tinseltown, Toast.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.720
Can you believe it?

25:58.720 --> 26:00.320
How's Ray Purchase?

26:00.320 --> 26:02.240
Two broken legs
and a badly sprained neck,

26:02.240 --> 26:03.840
he'll be out of action for months.

26:03.840 --> 26:06.680
Two broken legs, fantastic!

26:06.680 --> 26:10.840
Everything's worked out dandy,
Jane, just dandy.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.920
Have a nice day! Ha!

26:12.920 --> 26:17.680
I almost forgot, what's the name of
the movie that I'm going to be in?

26:17.680 --> 26:19.800
The latest Star Wars movie.

26:19.800 --> 26:23.160
You've heard of the Star Wars,
I take it?

26:23.160 --> 26:24.920
Yes, Jane,

26:24.920 --> 26:27.160
even I've heard Star Wars.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.840
Excuse me, buddy?
I think you're in my seat.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.920
Oh, yes.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.040
Apologies, old chap.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.240
Toast.

26:40.240 --> 26:42.600
Steven Toast.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.520
I'm Nightlife.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.440
Russ Nightlife.

26:46.440 --> 26:47.800
Pleased to meet you.
