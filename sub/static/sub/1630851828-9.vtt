39:26.865 --> 39:28.566
Kind of one of the reasons
I got into real estate

39:28.633 --> 39:30.768
was 'cause I wanted to set

39:30.835 --> 39:32.537
not only myself up
for the future,

39:32.604 --> 39:35.840
but, you know, set the
foundation for a family.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.408

to be an inspiration

39:37.475 --> 39:38.509
to others.

39:38.576 --> 39:40.378
I think my story,

39:40.445 --> 39:43.081

is, you know,

39:43.147 --> 39:45.016
a lot of people
kind of get lost

39:45.083 --> 39:46.384
after their sport.

39:46.451 --> 39:48.987

to be, you know, like,

39:49.053 --> 39:51.322
an example for others
to show that, you know,

39:51.389 --> 39:52.557
the tools and everything
that we learned

39:52.624 --> 39:54.392
through our athletics
is something

39:54.459 --> 39:56.060
that we can definitely bring
into the real world.

‐ And to influence

39:58.796 --> 40:00.598

the world.
