00:26.361 --> 00:28.196
«This is the Asgardian»

00:28.279 --> 00:30.740
«refugee vessel Statesman.»

00:33.493 --> 00:34.786
«We are under assault.»

00:34.869 --> 00:36.955
«I repeat,
we are under assault.»

00:37.122 --> 00:40.667
«The engines are dead,
life support failing.»

00:40.834 --> 00:43.795
«Requesting aid
from any vessel within range.»

00:43.962 --> 00:46.965
«We are 22 jump points out of Asgard.»

00:47.966 --> 00:50.593
«Our crew is made up
of Asgardian families.»

00:50.677 --> 00:52.178
«We have
very few soldiers here.»

00:52.345 --> 00:54.222
«This is not a warcraft.»

00:54.305 --> 00:56.307
«I repeat,
this is not a warcraft.»

01:09.779 --> 01:12.782
«Hear me and rejoice.»

01:16.578 --> 01:18.830
«You have had the privilege»

01:18.913 --> 01:21.583
«of being saved
by the Great Titan.»

01:24.544 --> 01:26.755
«You may think
this is suffering.»

01:27.964 --> 01:28.965
«No.»

01:30.008 --> 01:32.343
«It is salvation.»

01:36.222 --> 01:39.934
«Universal scales
tip toward balance»

01:40.018 --> 01:41.770
because of your sacrifice.

01:43.396 --> 01:44.814
Smile.

01:46.065 --> 01:48.151
For even in death,

01:48.234 --> 01:50.695
you have become
Children of Thanos.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
FarangSiam thanks you. Enjoy!

02:06.127 --> 02:08.170
I know what it's like to lose.

02:10.340 --> 02:13.301
To feel so desperately
that you're right...

02:14.052 --> 02:16.805
yet to fail, nonetheless.

02:24.896 --> 02:26.523
It's frightening.

02:27.857 --> 02:29.818
Turns the legs to jelly.

02:31.945 --> 02:34.072
But I ask you, to what end?

02:35.490 --> 02:38.076
Dread it, run from it...

02:39.118 --> 02:41.663
destiny arrives all the same.

02:42.872 --> 02:44.707
And now, it's here.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.126
Or should I say...

02:48.461 --> 02:49.963
I am.

02:55.426 --> 02:56.761
You talk too much.

02:58.054 --> 02:59.514
The Tesseract.

02:59.889 --> 03:02.016
Or your brother's head.

03:06.688 --> 03:09.065
I assume you have a preference.

03:10.316 --> 03:11.609
Oh, I do.

03:14.028 --> 03:15.071
Kill away.

03:30.336 --> 03:31.462
All right, stop!

03:35.008 --> 03:36.968
We don't have the Tesseract.

03:37.135 --> 03:38.970
It was destroyed on Asgard.

03:49.772 --> 03:52.650
You really are the worst brother.

03:57.697 --> 03:59.574
I assure you, brother...

03:59.741 --> 04:01.701
the sun will shine on us again.

04:03.661 --> 04:06.664
Your optimism is misplaced,
Asgardian.

04:06.998 --> 04:10.793
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.

04:11.127 --> 04:12.170
And for another...

04:14.589 --> 04:15.757
we have a Hulk.

04:27.143 --> 04:29.854
Let him have his fun.

05:22.156 --> 05:23.616
Allfathers...

05:25.493 --> 05:28.746
let the dark magic flow
through me one last...

05:29.580 --> 05:30.665
time.

05:45.471 --> 05:46.973
That was a mistake.

05:52.854 --> 05:54.522
No!

06:03.656 --> 06:06.284
You're going to die for that.

06:09.412 --> 06:10.663
Shh.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.297
My humble personage...

06:20.715 --> 06:23.009
bows before your grandeur.

06:26.304 --> 06:29.515
No other being
has ever had the might...

06:29.932 --> 06:31.601
nay, the nobility...

06:31.976 --> 06:36.689
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.

06:40.151 --> 06:44.572
The universe lies within your grasp.

07:23.820 --> 07:26.572
There are two more stones on Earth.

07:28.032 --> 07:31.536
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.

07:31.802 --> 07:33.252
Father, we will not fail you.

07:33.412 --> 07:34.914
If I might interject.

07:36.082 --> 07:39.377
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.

07:40.294 --> 07:42.880
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.

07:42.964 --> 07:45.383
If you consider failure experience.

07:45.466 --> 07:48.219
I consider experience experience.

07:49.428 --> 07:50.930
Almighty Thanos...

07:51.222 --> 07:55.893
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

07:59.689 --> 08:00.898
Odinson...

08:04.819 --> 08:06.737
the rightful king of Jotunheim...

08:07.363 --> 08:09.240
god of mischief...

08:10.116 --> 08:11.617
do hereby pledge to you...

08:13.035 --> 08:16.914
my undying fidelity.

08:27.466 --> 08:28.968
Undying?

08:32.763 --> 08:35.433
You should choose your words
more carefully.

08:56.954 --> 08:57.955
You...

08:59.081 --> 09:00.666
will never be...

09:03.377 --> 09:04.462
a god.

09:14.805 --> 09:15.806
No!

09:30.780 --> 09:33.282
No resurrections this time.

09:56.889 --> 09:59.058
No. Loki.

10:37.847 --> 10:40.850
«Seriously, you don't have any money?»

10:40.933 --> 10:43.978
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

10:44.145 --> 10:45.444
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

10:45.604 --> 10:47.488
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.648
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I think I have 200.

10:49.808 --> 10:50.651
Dollars?

10:50.818 --> 10:52.153
- Rupees.
- Which is?

10:52.737 --> 10:54.155
Uh, buck and a half.

10:54.322 --> 10:55.531
What do you want?

10:56.157 --> 10:58.326
I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.757
Thanos is coming.

11:13.299 --> 11:14.550
He's coming.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.139
Who?

11:28.939 --> 11:30.107
Slow down, slow down.
I'll spell it out for you.

11:30.191 --> 11:31.192
You're totally rambling.

11:31.275 --> 11:32.318
- No, I'm not.
- You lost me.

11:32.401 --> 11:33.527
Look, you know how
you're having a dream,

11:33.611 --> 11:34.975
and in the dream
you gotta pee.

11:35.135 --> 11:35.905
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:36.072 --> 11:37.198
And then you're like,
"Oh, my God."

11:37.281 --> 11:38.449
"There's no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?"

11:38.532 --> 11:39.533
- "Oh, someone's watching."
- Right.

11:39.617 --> 11:40.618
"Oh, I'm gonna go in my pants."

11:40.701 --> 11:41.786
And then you wake up
and in real life

11:41.869 --> 11:43.119
you actually have to pee.

11:43.279 --> 11:43.996
- Yes.
- Yeah.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.480
- Okay.
- Everybody has that.

11:45.647 --> 11:47.747
Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.

11:47.907 --> 11:51.420
Apropos of that, last night
I dreamt we had a kid.

11:52.004 --> 11:53.214
It was so real.

11:53.589 --> 11:54.924
We named him
after your eccentric uncle.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.107
Uh, what was his name?

11:56.267 --> 11:58.427
- Right.
- Morgan! Morgan.

11:58.594 --> 12:00.221
- So you woke up...
- Naturally.

12:00.388 --> 12:01.972
...and thought that we were...

12:02.139 --> 12:03.224
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

12:03.307 --> 12:04.350
- Yes?
- No.

12:04.433 --> 12:05.816
I had a dream about it.
It was so real.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.476
If you wanted to have a kid...

12:07.978 --> 12:09.397
you wouldn't have done that.

12:10.064 --> 12:12.024
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.

12:12.108 --> 12:13.532
It's just a housing unit
for nanoparticles.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.238
You're not helping
your case, okay?

12:15.321 --> 12:16.454
No, this is detachable.
It's not a...

12:16.614 --> 12:17.947
You don't need that.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.462
I know, I had the surgery.

12:19.545 --> 12:20.588
I'm just trying to protect us...

12:20.671 --> 12:22.326
and future usses and that's it.

12:22.493 --> 12:24.693
Just in case there's a monster
in the closet.

12:24.853 --> 12:26.772
- Instead of, you know...
- Shirts.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.208
You know me so well.

12:29.291 --> 12:32.002
- God.
- You finish all my sentences.

12:32.545 --> 12:34.422
You should have shirts
in your closet.

12:34.797 --> 12:35.798
Yeah.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.349
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.

12:38.509 --> 12:40.409
We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight.

12:40.569 --> 12:41.971
Show off this Harry Winston.

12:42.054 --> 12:44.504
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.

12:44.671 --> 12:45.721
I should promise you.

12:45.881 --> 12:47.060
- Yes.
- I will.

12:49.520 --> 12:50.563
Thank you.

12:50.646 --> 12:51.814
Tony Stark.

12:51.981 --> 12:54.984
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.

12:56.986 --> 12:59.572
Oh, uh, congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.

12:59.738 --> 13:02.038
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?

13:02.198 --> 13:03.616
We need your help.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.609
It's not overselling it to say that

13:05.693 --> 13:07.493
the fate of the universe is at stake.

13:07.653 --> 13:09.081
And who's "we"?

13:10.458 --> 13:11.500
Hey, Tony.

13:11.584 --> 13:12.710
Bruce.

13:12.877 --> 13:14.503
- Pepper.
- Hi.

13:17.506 --> 13:19.133
- Oh.
- You okay?

13:20.926 --> 13:23.095
At the dawn of the universe,

13:23.179 --> 13:25.139
there was nothing. Then...

13:25.514 --> 13:26.807
Boom.

13:27.349 --> 13:30.686
The Big Bang sent
six elemental crystals...

13:30.853 --> 13:33.689
hurtling across the virgin universe.

13:34.732 --> 13:36.275
These Infinity Stones

13:36.358 --> 13:39.278
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

13:40.237 --> 13:41.405
Space.

13:42.531 --> 13:43.699
Reality.

13:45.326 --> 13:46.494
Power.

13:47.703 --> 13:48.871
Soul.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.165
Mind.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.335
And Time.

14:03.928 --> 14:05.179
Tell me his name again.

14:05.262 --> 14:06.472
Thanos.

14:06.639 --> 14:07.932
He's a plague, Tony.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.115
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

14:10.275 --> 14:12.269
He wipes out half the population.

14:12.353 --> 14:14.063
He sent Loki.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.608
The attack on New York, that's him.

14:18.192 --> 14:19.318
This is it.

14:20.486 --> 14:21.487
What's our timeline?

14:21.570 --> 14:23.788
No telling.
He has the Power and Space Stones.

14:23.948 --> 14:25.048
That already makes him

14:25.131 --> 14:27.331
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.

14:27.491 --> 14:30.079
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

14:30.162 --> 14:31.247
He could destroy life

14:31.330 --> 14:33.332
on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.476
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

14:35.501 --> 14:38.251
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

14:38.411 --> 14:39.913
Is that what it is?

14:42.007 --> 14:43.926
I'm going to allow that.

14:46.136 --> 14:47.596
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just

14:47.680 --> 14:49.408
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?

14:49.568 --> 14:50.224
No can do.

14:50.391 --> 14:53.109
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

14:53.269 --> 14:54.469
And I swore off dairy...

14:54.629 --> 14:57.064
but then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavor after me.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.897
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- Not bad.

14:59.057 --> 15:00.150
A bit chalky.

15:00.317 --> 15:01.867
A Hunk of Hulk of
Burning Fudge is our favorite.

15:02.027 --> 15:03.300
- That's a thing?
- Whatever.

15:03.384 --> 15:04.584
Point is, things change.

15:04.744 --> 15:07.408
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.

15:07.491 --> 15:09.618
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

15:09.702 --> 15:10.703
Yeah, so conversely,

15:10.786 --> 15:12.663
it may also be his best chance
against us.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.206
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

15:14.290 --> 15:15.540
What is your job exactly?

15:15.700 --> 15:17.327
Besides making balloon animals.

15:18.127 --> 15:20.754
Protecting your reality, douchebag.

15:20.838 --> 15:23.438
Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?

15:23.598 --> 15:25.384
The fact is we have this stone.

15:25.467 --> 15:26.760
We know where it is.

15:27.136 --> 15:29.686
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...

15:29.846 --> 15:31.556
and we have to find him now.

15:32.141 --> 15:33.559
Yeah, that's the thing.

15:33.642 --> 15:34.643
What do you mean?

15:34.768 --> 15:37.168
Two weeks ago, Vision turned
off his transponder.

15:37.328 --> 15:38.188
He's offline.

15:38.272 --> 15:39.523
- What?
- Yeah.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.692
Tony, you lost another super-bot?

15:41.775 --> 15:44.425
I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.

15:44.585 --> 15:46.045
Who could find Vision then?

15:48.657 --> 15:49.658
Shit.

15:50.326 --> 15:51.426
Probably Steve Rogers.

15:51.586 --> 15:52.754
Oh, great.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.330
Maybe.

15:54.955 --> 15:55.956
But...

15:59.418 --> 16:00.544
Call him.

16:01.295 --> 16:02.588
It's not that easy.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.922
God, we haven't caught up
in a spell, have we?

16:06.082 --> 16:06.634
No.

16:06.717 --> 16:08.417
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.095
Broke up?

16:12.014 --> 16:13.974
Like a band?
Like... Like the Beatles?

16:14.058 --> 16:15.976
Cap and I fell out hard.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.377
We're not on speaking terms.

16:19.605 --> 16:22.107
Tony, listen to me.

16:23.192 --> 16:24.526
Thor's gone.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.404
Thanos is coming.

16:27.488 --> 16:29.788
It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

16:46.382 --> 16:47.383
Flip phone.

17:08.487 --> 17:10.186
Say, Doc, you wouldn't
happen to be

17:10.347 --> 17:11.696
moving your hair, would ya?

17:11.906 --> 17:14.117
Not at the moment, no.

17:46.817 --> 17:48.652
You okay?

17:49.778 --> 17:50.779
- Help him!
- Banner!

17:50.946 --> 17:52.538
- Wong! Look alive!
- Go, go! We got it!

17:52.698 --> 17:53.741
Friday, what am I looking at?

17:53.824 --> 17:55.174
«Not sure.
I'm working on it.»

17:55.334 --> 17:57.369
Hey! You might wanna
put that Time Stone

17:57.453 --> 17:58.703
in your back pocket, Doc!

17:58.863 --> 18:00.072
Might wanna use it.

18:27.483 --> 18:29.777
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.236
Holy shit.

18:31.612 --> 18:33.155
We're all gonna die!

18:33.238 --> 18:34.448
There's a spaceship!

18:34.615 --> 18:36.325
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!

18:44.875 --> 18:46.425
What's the matter
with you kids?

18:46.585 --> 18:48.378
You never seen
a spaceship before?

19:00.098 --> 19:02.434
Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd Street.

19:02.518 --> 19:03.718
Notify first responders.

19:03.878 --> 19:05.046
«Will do.»

19:33.215 --> 19:36.134
Hear me and rejoice.

19:37.511 --> 19:38.971
You are about to die

19:39.054 --> 19:41.098
at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.

19:41.181 --> 19:43.725
Be thankful...

19:43.892 --> 19:46.436
that your meaningless lives
are now contributing...

19:46.812 --> 19:49.565
I'm sorry,
Earth is closed today.

19:49.731 --> 19:52.442
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

19:52.609 --> 19:53.735
Stonekeeper.

19:54.695 --> 19:57.030
Does this chattering animal
speak for you?

19:57.114 --> 19:58.907
Certainly not.
I speak for myself.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.866
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.

20:02.786 --> 20:04.246
He means get lost, Squidward.

20:04.413 --> 20:05.581
He exhausts me.

20:05.664 --> 20:07.708
Bring me the stone.

20:09.334 --> 20:10.794
Banner, you want a piece?

20:11.420 --> 20:13.171
Mmm, no, not really.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.801
But when do I ever get
what I want?

20:14.961 --> 20:15.962
That's right.

20:16.425 --> 20:17.634
Okay. Push!

20:17.801 --> 20:19.261
It's been a while.

20:19.428 --> 20:21.278
It's gonna be good
to have you, buddy.

20:21.438 --> 20:22.097
Okay. Shh.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.933
Let me just... I need to
concentrate here for a second.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.351
Come on, come on, man.

20:26.435 --> 20:28.729
God!

20:29.855 --> 20:31.106
Where's your guy?

20:32.524 --> 20:33.984
I don't know. We've sorta
been having a thing.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.867
- It's no time for a thing.
- I know.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.927
That's the thing right there.
Let's go.

20:43.952 --> 20:45.127
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.437
Tony, I'm sorry.
Either I can't or he won't.

20:47.597 --> 20:48.290
It's okay.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.751
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

20:50.918 --> 20:52.252
- I have him.
- Damn it.

21:19.947 --> 21:21.114
Where'd that come from?

21:21.281 --> 21:22.324
¦It's nanotech.¦

21:22.407 --> 21:24.157
¦You like it? A little something I...¦

21:27.198 --> 21:29.498
Doctor Banner, if the rest
of your green friend

21:29.581 --> 21:30.707
won't be joining us...

21:40.384 --> 21:42.021
¦Gotta get that stone
outta here, now.¦

21:42.181 --> 21:43.136
It stays with me.

21:43.303 --> 21:44.638
Exactly. Bye.

21:53.981 --> 21:55.190
Tony, you okay?

21:55.357 --> 21:57.317
- How we doing? Good? Bad?
¦- Really, really good.¦

21:57.401 --> 21:59.351
¦Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?¦

21:59.511 --> 22:01.011
I'm trying. He won't come out.

22:01.863 --> 22:02.948
¦Hammer.¦

22:10.706 --> 22:13.583
Come on, Hulk!
What are you doing to me?

22:13.750 --> 22:15.877
Come out! Come out! Come out!

22:16.044 --> 22:18.255
No!

22:22.134 --> 22:23.927
What do you mean, "no"?

22:29.683 --> 22:31.309
Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Stark?

22:31.476 --> 22:34.271
¦- Kid, where'd you come from?¦
- A field trip to MoMA.

22:36.314 --> 22:38.364
Uh, what is this guy's problem,
Mr. Stark?

22:38.692 --> 22:39.943
Uh, he's from space.

22:40.027 --> 22:42.327
He came here to steal
a necklace from a wizard.

23:08.638 --> 23:10.474
Your powers are quaint.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.309
You must be popular
with children.

23:15.270 --> 23:17.320
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.441
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

23:32.245 --> 23:37.417
You'll find removing a
dead man's spell troublesome.

23:37.501 --> 23:39.169
You'll only wish
you were dead.

23:49.429 --> 23:50.430
No!

23:54.601 --> 23:56.251
¦Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.¦

23:56.411 --> 23:57.955
On it!

24:05.237 --> 24:06.613
Not cool.

24:10.867 --> 24:11.868
Gotcha!

24:13.370 --> 24:14.621
Wait!

24:22.045 --> 24:24.673
Uh, Mr. Stark, I'm being beamed up.

24:24.756 --> 24:26.174
¦Hang on, kid.¦

24:41.857 --> 24:43.233
Oh!

24:45.026 --> 24:46.027
Ugh.

24:46.111 --> 24:47.863
¦Wong, you're invited to my wedding.¦

24:55.412 --> 24:56.912
Give me a little juice, Friday.

25:05.463 --> 25:06.882
Unlock 17:A.

25:19.895 --> 25:22.045
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

25:22.205 --> 25:23.732
But you said save the wizard!

25:24.149 --> 25:25.150
I can't breathe.

25:26.443 --> 25:28.643
We're too high up.
You're running out of air.

25:29.070 --> 25:31.323
Yeah. That makes sense.

25:48.506 --> 25:50.656
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here!

25:50.816 --> 25:51.718
¦Happy trails, kid.¦

25:51.801 --> 25:53.301
¦- Friday, send him home.
- Yep.¦

25:54.179 --> 25:55.639
Oh, come on!

26:04.064 --> 26:06.066
¦Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.¦

26:06.233 --> 26:07.234
¦Tony? Oh, my God.¦

26:07.317 --> 26:08.325
¦Are you all right? What's going on?¦

26:08.485 --> 26:09.835
¦Yeah, I'm fine. I just think¦

26:09.918 --> 26:11.618
¦we might have to push our 8:30 res.¦

26:11.778 --> 26:12.322
¦Why?¦

26:12.405 --> 26:13.907
¦Just 'cause I'll probably¦

26:13.990 --> 26:15.440
¦not make it back for a while.¦

26:16.493 --> 26:18.043
¦Tell me you're not on that ship.¦

26:18.203 --> 26:18.828
Yeah.

26:18.912 --> 26:21.003
¦God, no, please tell me
you're not on the ship.¦

26:21.163 --> 26:21.998
Honey, I'm sorry.

26:22.165 --> 26:23.333
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.

26:23.416 --> 26:25.053
¦Come back here, Tony.
I swear to God.¦

26:25.213 --> 26:26.920
- Pep.
¦- Come back here right now.¦

26:27.045 --> 26:28.046
¦Come back.¦

26:28.213 --> 26:30.131
¦Boss, we're losing her.¦

26:30.799 --> 26:32.342
¦I'm going too.¦

26:41.434 --> 26:42.686
Oh, my God!

26:47.148 --> 26:49.109
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

27:03.456 --> 27:04.833
Where you going?

27:05.108 --> 27:06.508
The Time Stone's been taken.

27:06.668 --> 27:08.586
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

27:09.212 --> 27:10.672
What will you do?

27:11.464 --> 27:13.133
I'm gonna make a call.

27:53.423 --> 27:54.591
Sing it, Drax!

28:07.170 --> 28:08.570
Why are we doing this again?

28:08.730 --> 28:10.357
It's a distress signal,
Rocket.

28:10.440 --> 28:11.590
Someone could be dying.

28:11.750 --> 28:13.693
I get that,
but why are we doing it?

28:13.860 --> 28:15.653
'Cause we're nice.

28:15.820 --> 28:16.821
And maybe whoever it is

28:16.905 --> 28:18.580
will give us a little
cheddar cheese for our effort.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.140
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.952
I mean,
if he doesn't pony up...

28:23.119 --> 28:24.162
We take his ship.

28:24.329 --> 28:25.997
- Exactly!
- Bingo!

28:26.081 --> 28:27.207
All right!

28:30.377 --> 28:31.836
We are arriving.

28:32.204 --> 28:33.254
All right, Guardians,

28:33.338 --> 28:35.238
don't forget
this might be dangerous...

28:35.398 --> 28:37.692
so let's put on
our mean faces.

28:42.173 --> 28:43.723
Groot, put that
thing away, now.

28:43.807 --> 28:45.257
I don't wanna tell you again.

28:45.417 --> 28:46.017
Groot.

28:46.184 --> 28:47.310
I am Groot!

28:47.394 --> 28:48.395
- Whoa!
- Language!

28:48.520 --> 28:49.854
- Hey!
- Wow.

28:50.021 --> 28:51.689
You got some
acorns on you, kid.

28:51.850 --> 28:53.400
Ever since
you got a little sap,

28:53.483 --> 28:54.583
you're a total d-hole.

28:55.443 --> 28:58.696
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces.

29:05.620 --> 29:07.163
What happened?

29:11.209 --> 29:12.544
Oh, my God.

29:18.133 --> 29:19.884
Looks like
we're not getting paid.

29:22.137 --> 29:24.097
Wipers! Wipers!

29:24.264 --> 29:25.557
Get it off.

29:32.230 --> 29:34.983
How the hell
is this dude still alive?

29:35.150 --> 29:36.943
He is not a dude.

29:37.110 --> 29:38.653
You're a dude.

29:38.987 --> 29:42.031
This... This is a man.

29:42.407 --> 29:45.160
A handsome, muscular man.

29:45.326 --> 29:46.327
I'm muscular.

29:46.411 --> 29:47.412
But who are you
kidding, Quill?

29:47.495 --> 29:49.145
You're one sandwich
away from fat.

29:49.305 --> 29:49.956
Yeah, right.

29:50.039 --> 29:52.039
It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.

29:52.199 --> 29:53.534
What?

29:54.919 --> 29:56.754
Gamora, do you think I'm...

29:59.048 --> 30:02.635
He is anxious, angry.

30:02.802 --> 30:05.680
He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.

30:06.556 --> 30:09.309
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.

30:09.392 --> 30:10.477
Wow.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.560
This is a real wake-up call
for me. Okay.

30:12.720 --> 30:15.315
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.

30:15.482 --> 30:16.483
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

30:16.608 --> 30:17.949
You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?

30:18.109 --> 30:19.319
It's like his muscles

30:19.402 --> 30:21.321
are made
of Cotati metal fibers.

30:21.488 --> 30:23.198
Stop massaging his muscles.

30:24.991 --> 30:25.992
Wake him up.

30:29.078 --> 30:30.079
Wake.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.933
Who the hell are you guys?

30:52.727 --> 30:56.356
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

30:56.523 --> 30:58.233
To bring balance
to the universe

30:58.316 --> 31:00.485
by wiping out
half of all life.

31:01.402 --> 31:03.613
He used to kill people
planet by planet,

31:03.696 --> 31:05.073
massacre by massacre.

31:05.365 --> 31:06.741
Including my own.

31:06.908 --> 31:08.708
If he gets
all six Infinity Stones...

31:08.868 --> 31:11.418
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.

31:11.871 --> 31:14.457
You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.

31:14.624 --> 31:18.419
Gamora
is the daughter of Thanos.

31:22.465 --> 31:24.551
Your father killed my brother.

31:24.884 --> 31:26.094
Oh, boy.

31:26.261 --> 31:27.929
Stepfather, technically.

31:28.096 --> 31:30.014
And she hates him
as much as you do.

31:33.726 --> 31:35.270
Families can be tough.

31:35.436 --> 31:36.771
Before my father died,

31:36.854 --> 31:38.704
he told me
that I had a half-sister...

31:38.864 --> 31:41.025
that he imprisoned in Hel.

31:41.192 --> 31:44.153
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.613
So I had to kill her.

31:45.780 --> 31:47.824
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.

31:47.907 --> 31:49.257
Goes round and round and...

31:49.993 --> 31:50.994
I feel your pain.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.454
I feel your pain as well,
because...

31:53.621 --> 31:54.789
I mean,
it's not a competition,

31:54.872 --> 31:56.272
but I've been through a lot.

31:56.432 --> 31:57.834
My father killed my mother.

31:58.001 --> 31:59.601
And then I had to kill
my father.

31:59.761 --> 32:00.712
That was hard.

32:00.878 --> 32:03.756
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

32:04.299 --> 32:07.176
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...

32:07.343 --> 32:09.053
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

32:10.888 --> 32:13.975
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...

32:14.517 --> 32:17.061
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

32:17.145 --> 32:20.523
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Taking your pod.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.026
No, you're not.

32:25.153 --> 32:29.032
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

32:29.532 --> 32:32.910
Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?

32:34.829 --> 32:36.456
- No.
- You are.

32:36.623 --> 32:39.334
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

32:39.500 --> 32:40.668
No, I'm not.

32:40.835 --> 32:42.935
- He just did it again!
- This is my voice.

32:49.052 --> 32:50.053
Are you mocking me?

32:50.511 --> 32:53.431
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.

32:53.782 --> 32:54.932
He's trying to copy me.

32:55.016 --> 32:56.024
I need you to stop doing that.

32:56.184 --> 32:57.810
- Enough!
- He's doing it first.

32:57.977 --> 32:59.354
We need to stop Thanos.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.064
Which means
we need to find out

33:01.147 --> 33:02.247
where he's going next.

33:02.407 --> 33:03.566
Knowhere.

33:03.733 --> 33:05.401
He must be going somewhere.

33:05.568 --> 33:07.570
No, no. Knowhere?

33:07.737 --> 33:10.406
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.

33:10.573 --> 33:12.992
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.

33:13.409 --> 33:16.579
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?

33:16.746 --> 33:17.914
Because for years...

33:18.081 --> 33:20.249
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there

33:20.333 --> 33:21.758
with a man
called the Collector.

33:21.918 --> 33:23.510
If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.

33:23.670 --> 33:25.534
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.

33:25.694 --> 33:27.246
- Or a genius.
- How do you know...

33:27.406 --> 33:29.634
he's not going
for one of the other stones?

33:29.801 --> 33:32.178
There are six stones
out there.

33:32.345 --> 33:34.555
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...

33:34.722 --> 33:38.017
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

33:38.476 --> 33:40.520
He stole the Space Stone
from me...

33:40.687 --> 33:43.363
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

33:43.523 --> 33:45.149
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.

33:45.233 --> 33:46.533
They're with the Avengers.

33:46.693 --> 33:48.820
- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.

33:48.986 --> 33:50.113
Like Kevin Bacon?

33:50.279 --> 33:51.572
He may be on the team.
I don't know.

33:51.656 --> 33:52.664
I haven't been there
in a while.

33:52.824 --> 33:55.188
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

33:55.348 --> 33:56.828
No one even knows where it is.

33:56.994 --> 33:58.746
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

33:58.830 --> 34:00.430
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.

34:00.590 --> 34:02.875
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.

34:03.042 --> 34:04.085
You're welcome.

34:04.252 --> 34:05.952
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.

34:06.112 --> 34:09.297
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.

34:09.757 --> 34:12.157
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.

34:12.317 --> 34:14.846
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

34:15.012 --> 34:16.639
That place is a legend.

34:16.806 --> 34:18.806
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons

34:18.966 --> 34:20.351
to ever torment the universe.

34:20.518 --> 34:22.569
I would very much like
to go there, please.

34:22.728 --> 34:23.779
The rabbit is correct

34:23.862 --> 34:25.408
and clearly the smartest
among you.

34:25.568 --> 34:25.987
Rabbit?

34:26.149 --> 34:28.408
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.

34:28.568 --> 34:29.784
I assume
you're the captain, sir.

34:29.944 --> 34:30.952
You're very perceptive.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.321
You seem like a noble leader.

34:32.405 --> 34:33.996
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?

34:34.157 --> 34:36.951
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

34:37.118 --> 34:38.870
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!

34:39.036 --> 34:40.786
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.

34:40.946 --> 34:41.246
Quiet.

34:41.330 --> 34:43.080
- That's my backpack.
- Go sit down.

34:43.239 --> 34:44.708
Look, this is my ship.

34:44.876 --> 34:46.627
And I'm not goin' to...

34:47.628 --> 34:50.078
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

34:50.237 --> 34:51.489
The Thanos-killing kind.

34:51.966 --> 34:53.474
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

34:53.634 --> 34:55.685
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

34:55.844 --> 34:56.929
Your bodies would crumble

34:57.013 --> 34:58.187
as your minds collapsed
into madness.

34:58.347 --> 35:00.347
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?

35:00.507 --> 35:01.608
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

35:01.768 --> 35:03.019
If we don't go to Knowhere

35:03.102 --> 35:04.739
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...

35:04.899 --> 35:06.397
he'll be too powerful to stop.

35:06.564 --> 35:08.733
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.

35:08.900 --> 35:10.610
We got two ships

35:10.693 --> 35:12.293
and a large assortment
of morons.

35:12.453 --> 35:15.490
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

35:15.656 --> 35:17.156
And the morons
will go to Knowhere

35:17.316 --> 35:18.493
to try to stop Thanos.

35:18.659 --> 35:20.578
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

35:20.745 --> 35:22.038
For the record...

35:22.668 --> 35:24.123
I know that
you're going with him

35:24.207 --> 35:25.298
because it's where
Thanos isn't.

35:25.458 --> 35:26.959
You know, you really shouldn't

35:27.043 --> 35:29.170
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.

35:30.129 --> 35:31.464
Come on, Groot.

35:32.006 --> 35:34.717
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

35:38.429 --> 35:41.265
I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.

35:41.432 --> 35:42.558
Bye.

35:57.323 --> 35:58.449
Vis?

35:58.908 --> 36:00.827
Is it the stone again?

36:00.993 --> 36:02.620
It's as if
it's speaking to me.

36:03.246 --> 36:04.956
What does it say?

36:05.873 --> 36:08.209
I don't... I don't know,
but something.

36:09.794 --> 36:11.671
Hey.

36:21.514 --> 36:24.016
Tell me what you feel.

36:31.023 --> 36:33.734
I just feel you.

36:41.909 --> 36:43.828
So there's a 10:00 a.m.
to Glasgow...

36:43.995 --> 36:46.003
which would give us more time
together before you went back.

36:46.163 --> 36:47.623
What if
I miss that train?

36:47.790 --> 36:48.791
There's an 11:00.

36:48.958 --> 36:51.377
What if I missed
all the trains?

36:52.753 --> 36:54.463
What if this time
I didn't go back?

36:54.630 --> 36:55.972
But you gave Stark your word.

36:56.132 --> 36:57.314
I'd rather give it to you.

36:57.474 --> 36:59.442
Well, there are people who are
expecting me too, you know.

36:59.602 --> 37:00.928
We both made promises.

37:01.095 --> 37:02.805
Not to each other.

37:03.222 --> 37:04.223
Wanda.

37:05.182 --> 37:07.518
For two years,
we've stolen these moments...

37:07.685 --> 37:09.729
trying to see
if this could work and...

37:09.896 --> 37:11.480
I don't know.

37:11.647 --> 37:13.947
You know what, I'm just
gonna speak for myself.

37:14.107 --> 37:15.484
I think...

37:15.651 --> 37:16.751
- It works.
- It works.

37:16.911 --> 37:18.203
It works.

37:20.656 --> 37:21.908
Stay.

37:22.825 --> 37:24.493
Stay with me.

37:29.248 --> 37:32.501
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

37:39.550 --> 37:41.302
What are they?

37:41.636 --> 37:44.055
What the stone
was warning me about.

37:54.023 --> 37:55.358
I have to go.

37:55.441 --> 37:56.442
No, Vision.

37:57.068 --> 37:58.319
Vision, if that's true,

37:58.402 --> 38:01.197
then maybe
going isn't the best idea.

38:02.239 --> 38:03.324
Wanda, I...

38:03.491 --> 38:05.534
Vision!

38:33.688 --> 38:36.357
The blade,
it stopped me from phasing.

38:37.274 --> 38:39.774
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

38:40.319 --> 38:42.029
My systems are failing.

38:42.947 --> 38:45.616
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.370
Vis!

38:58.254 --> 39:01.632
Give up the stone,
and she lives.

39:39.754 --> 39:40.963
Hands off.

39:56.771 --> 39:58.022
Come on. Come on.

39:58.189 --> 39:59.982
Come on, you gotta get up.

40:00.149 --> 40:02.359
You gotta get up.
Come on. Hey.

40:03.444 --> 40:04.862
Hey. We have to go.

40:06.781 --> 40:09.366
Please. Please leave.

40:09.492 --> 40:11.285
You asked me to stay.

40:12.536 --> 40:13.704
- I'm staying.
- Please.

41:24.900 --> 41:26.610
- Get up.
- I can't.

41:26.777 --> 41:29.488
We don't wanna kill you,
but we will.

41:29.655 --> 41:31.824
You'll never get
the chance again.

41:47.798 --> 41:49.341
Can you stand?

41:54.096 --> 41:55.514
Thank you, Captain.

41:58.225 --> 41:59.852
Let's get you on the jet.

42:03.814 --> 42:07.234
Now, I thought we had a deal.

42:07.401 --> 42:11.113
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.

42:11.280 --> 42:12.615
I'm sorry.

42:12.781 --> 42:14.575
We just wanted time.

42:17.286 --> 42:18.537
Where to, Cap?

42:21.373 --> 42:22.875
Home.

42:26.462 --> 42:28.505
We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.

42:53.072 --> 42:54.114
«Zehobereians.»

42:54.281 --> 42:56.033
Mother! Where's my mother?

42:56.200 --> 42:57.534
«Choose a side or die.»

42:57.701 --> 42:59.161
Mother!

42:59.328 --> 43:01.497
«One side is a revelation...»

43:01.664 --> 43:04.708
«the other an honor known only to a few.»

43:05.626 --> 43:07.086
What's wrong, little one?

43:07.711 --> 43:11.131
My mother. Where is my mother?

43:15.928 --> 43:17.137
What's your name?

43:18.472 --> 43:20.140
Gamora.

43:20.641 --> 43:22.768
You're quite the fighter, Gamora.

43:24.311 --> 43:25.312
Come.

43:25.688 --> 43:26.689
Let me help you.

43:40.202 --> 43:41.328
Look.

43:44.999 --> 43:46.667
Pretty, isn't it?

43:47.418 --> 43:50.879
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.

43:51.046 --> 43:54.800
Too much to one side or the other...

43:58.804 --> 44:01.640
Here. You try.

44:05.394 --> 44:08.480
«Now, go in peace to meet your maker.»

44:09.982 --> 44:11.817
Uh-uh.

44:13.736 --> 44:15.279
Concentrate.

44:18.240 --> 44:21.035
There. You've got it.

44:30.544 --> 44:31.628
Gamora.

44:32.713 --> 44:33.797
Do you know if these grenades

44:33.881 --> 44:36.056
are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind?

44:36.216 --> 44:37.301
Because I was thinking about

44:37.384 --> 44:38.969
hanging a couple
on my belt right here.

44:39.053 --> 44:40.690
But I don't want to
if they're the...

44:40.850 --> 44:42.102
I need to ask a favor.

44:42.389 --> 44:43.724
Yeah, sure.

44:45.267 --> 44:46.352
One way or another,

44:46.435 --> 44:48.687
the path that we're on
leads to Thanos.

44:50.439 --> 44:52.139
Which is what
the grenades are for.

44:52.858 --> 44:55.194
Uh, I'm sorry.
What's the favor?

44:57.529 --> 44:58.579
If things go wrong...

45:00.115 --> 45:02.284
If Thanos gets me...

45:06.830 --> 45:08.791
I want you to promise me...

45:09.833 --> 45:10.959
you'll kill me.

45:11.710 --> 45:12.711
What?

45:15.881 --> 45:18.258
I know something he doesn't.

45:20.803 --> 45:23.013
And if he finds it out,

45:23.097 --> 45:24.897
the entire universe
could be at risk.

45:25.140 --> 45:26.225
What do you know?

45:26.392 --> 45:28.435
If I tell you, you'd know too.

45:31.480 --> 45:33.315
If it's so important...

45:33.482 --> 45:34.483
shouldn't I?

45:34.608 --> 45:35.818
Only if you wanna die.

45:35.984 --> 45:38.634
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

45:38.987 --> 45:39.988
Just...

45:42.408 --> 45:45.411
Trust me.
And possibly kill me.

45:45.577 --> 45:47.913
I mean, I'd like to.

45:48.080 --> 45:49.915
I really would. But you...

45:50.082 --> 45:51.291
Swear to me.

45:54.795 --> 45:57.089
Swear to me on your mother.

46:04.096 --> 46:05.097
Okay.

46:11.186 --> 46:12.312
Okay.

46:28.537 --> 46:29.580
- Oh.
- Dude.

46:29.663 --> 46:31.513
How long have you been
standing there?

46:31.673 --> 46:32.573
An hour.

46:32.833 --> 46:34.084
An hour?

46:34.626 --> 46:35.919
Are you serious?

46:36.086 --> 46:38.255
I've mastered the ability

46:38.338 --> 46:41.008
of standing
so incredibly still...

46:42.217 --> 46:44.803
that I become
invisible to the eye.

46:45.429 --> 46:46.430
Watch.

46:50.350 --> 46:51.935
You're eating a zarg-nut.

46:52.394 --> 46:53.812
But my movement...

46:54.646 --> 46:56.273
was so slow...

46:57.107 --> 46:58.942
that it's imperceptible.

46:59.109 --> 47:00.110
Mmm, no.

47:00.194 --> 47:02.529
I'm sure I'm invisible.

47:02.696 --> 47:03.864
Hi, Drax.

47:06.575 --> 47:07.576
Damn it.

47:27.471 --> 47:29.223
This place looks deserted.

47:29.389 --> 47:32.142
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.

47:32.309 --> 47:34.228
Yep,
I'm picking that up too.

47:35.646 --> 47:37.105
Let's put down right here.

47:48.867 --> 47:50.410
I don't have it.

47:52.538 --> 47:54.248
Everyone
in the galaxy knows

47:54.331 --> 47:55.831
you'd sell your own brother...

47:55.998 --> 47:58.544
if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...

47:58.704 --> 48:00.541
to your pathetic collection.

48:07.427 --> 48:09.846
I know you have
the Reality Stone, Tivan.

48:10.806 --> 48:14.268
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

48:17.521 --> 48:19.106
I told you.

48:19.898 --> 48:20.899
I sold it.

48:23.777 --> 48:25.779
Why would I lie?

48:25.946 --> 48:28.156
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.

48:28.991 --> 48:30.701
Like suicide.

48:30.867 --> 48:32.369
You do understand.

48:33.328 --> 48:36.331
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.

48:36.498 --> 48:37.874
I didn't know what it was.

48:38.250 --> 48:40.836
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.

48:41.211 --> 48:42.212
It's him.

48:42.379 --> 48:43.839
Last chance,
charlatan.

48:45.382 --> 48:47.342
Where's the stone?

48:47.509 --> 48:48.510
Today...

48:48.927 --> 48:49.928
Drax. Drax.

48:50.095 --> 48:52.545
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

48:52.705 --> 48:53.747
Drax, wait.

48:54.683 --> 48:56.059
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

48:56.226 --> 48:57.477
Drax.

49:01.356 --> 49:03.609
Drax, Drax, Drax.
Listen to me.

49:03.775 --> 49:06.028
He doesn't have the stone yet.

49:06.194 --> 49:07.894
If we get it,
then we can stop him.

49:08.655 --> 49:11.825
We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.

49:11.992 --> 49:13.076
No.

49:13.243 --> 49:16.288
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

49:16.747 --> 49:18.040
Sleep.

49:29.968 --> 49:30.969
Okay.

49:31.136 --> 49:35.223
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

49:36.600 --> 49:37.851
The other right.

50:02.167 --> 50:03.877
Why?

50:13.887 --> 50:17.974
Why you, daughter?

50:36.576 --> 50:37.577
That was quick.

50:43.375 --> 50:48.255
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Magnificent!

50:50.590 --> 50:53.301
«Is that sadness I sense in you,
daughter?»

50:56.430 --> 50:58.932
«In my heart, I knew you still cared.»

51:06.314 --> 51:09.568
«But one never knows for sure.»

51:18.785 --> 51:21.621
«Reality is often disappointing.»

51:24.791 --> 51:27.043
That is, it was.

51:29.087 --> 51:30.464
Now...

51:32.466 --> 51:35.260
reality can be whatever I want.

51:36.803 --> 51:38.263
You knew I'd come.

51:38.430 --> 51:40.056
I counted on it.

51:40.849 --> 51:43.769
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

51:48.398 --> 51:50.108
Thanos!

51:57.699 --> 51:58.742
No!

52:03.121 --> 52:04.706
Let her go, Grimace.

52:05.165 --> 52:06.166
Peter.

52:07.626 --> 52:08.877
I told you to go right.

52:09.461 --> 52:10.837
Now? Really?

52:11.004 --> 52:12.422
You let her go!

52:12.839 --> 52:14.549
Ah, the boyfriend.

52:14.716 --> 52:15.717
No.

52:15.884 --> 52:17.052
Like to think of myself

52:17.135 --> 52:19.596
more as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.

52:19.763 --> 52:21.807
- Let her go.
- Peter.

52:21.973 --> 52:26.686
I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin
right off your face.

52:27.270 --> 52:28.772
Not him.

52:39.241 --> 52:42.953
You promised. You promised.

52:47.123 --> 52:48.333
Oh, daughter.

52:48.792 --> 52:51.294
You expect too much from him.

52:54.881 --> 52:56.466
She's asked, hasn't she?

53:00.428 --> 53:01.429
Do it.

53:05.267 --> 53:06.518
Mmm.

53:07.769 --> 53:09.187
Do it!

53:15.944 --> 53:17.362
I told you to go right.

53:19.322 --> 53:22.284
I love you more than anything.

53:25.412 --> 53:26.913
I love you too.

53:41.219 --> 53:42.262
I like him.

54:13.084 --> 54:14.920
¦Still no word from Vision?¦

54:15.045 --> 54:17.672
Satellites lost him somewhere
over Edinburgh.

54:18.298 --> 54:19.341
¦On a stolen Quinjet¦

54:19.424 --> 54:21.516
¦with four of the world's
most wanted criminals.¦

54:21.676 --> 54:23.261
You know they're only criminals because

54:23.345 --> 54:25.300
you've chosen to call them that,
right, sir?

54:25.460 --> 54:26.586
¦My God, Rhodes.¦

54:26.753 --> 54:29.517
¦Your talent for horseshit rivals my own.¦

54:29.684 --> 54:31.234
If it weren't for those Accords,

54:31.394 --> 54:32.944
Vision would've been right here.

54:33.104 --> 54:36.315
¦I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.¦

54:36.733 --> 54:37.734
That's right.

54:39.736 --> 54:41.571
And I'm pretty sure I paid for that.

54:41.738 --> 54:42.988
¦You have second thoughts?¦

54:43.148 --> 54:44.858
Not anymore.

54:50.664 --> 54:52.248
Mr. Secretary.

54:56.795 --> 54:58.463
¦You got some nerve.¦

54:59.130 --> 55:00.757
¦I'll give you that.¦

55:00.924 --> 55:02.724
You could use some of that right now.

55:03.510 --> 55:05.762
¦The world's on fire.¦

55:06.554 --> 55:09.641
¦And you think all is forgiven?¦

55:10.225 --> 55:12.102
I'm not looking for forgiveness.

55:12.185 --> 55:14.312
And I'm way past asking permission.

55:16.272 --> 55:18.316
Earth just lost her best defender.

55:18.817 --> 55:20.026
So we're here to fight.

55:21.611 --> 55:23.530
And if you wanna stand in our way...

55:24.531 --> 55:26.449
we'll fight you too.

55:29.703 --> 55:30.704
¦Arrest them.¦

55:31.830 --> 55:33.415
All over it.

55:38.503 --> 55:39.879
That's a court-martial.

55:42.340 --> 55:43.690
It's great to see you, Cap.

55:44.467 --> 55:46.219
You too, Rhodey.

55:46.302 --> 55:47.303
Hey.

55:48.638 --> 55:50.932
Wow. You guys...

55:51.766 --> 55:53.768
really look like crap.

55:53.935 --> 55:55.585
Must've been
a rough couple years.

55:55.745 --> 55:58.414
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

55:58.815 --> 56:00.984
Uh, I think
you look great.

56:04.320 --> 56:05.405
Uh...

56:08.074 --> 56:10.118
Yeah, I'm back.

56:11.786 --> 56:12.787
Hi, Bruce.

56:18.334 --> 56:19.335
Nat.

56:22.756 --> 56:24.299
This is awkward.

56:26.801 --> 56:28.351
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?

56:28.511 --> 56:29.830
And they can clearly find us.

56:29.990 --> 56:32.057
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

56:32.308 --> 56:33.808
After the whole
Accords situation,

56:33.933 --> 56:35.442
he and Scott took a deal.
It was too tough

56:35.602 --> 56:37.145
on their families.
They're on house arrest.

56:37.270 --> 56:38.563
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

56:38.730 --> 56:40.480
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

56:41.107 --> 56:42.150
Okay, look.

56:42.233 --> 56:45.070
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...

56:45.236 --> 56:48.656
and he is not gonna stop
until he gets...

56:50.492 --> 56:51.534
Vision's stone.

56:51.701 --> 56:53.051
Then we have to protect it.

56:53.211 --> 56:54.838
No, we have to destroy it.

56:56.915 --> 56:58.208
I've been giving
a good deal of thought

56:58.291 --> 56:59.591
to this entity in my head.

56:59.751 --> 57:00.960
About its nature.

57:01.503 --> 57:03.671
But also its composition.

57:03.838 --> 57:05.840
I think if it were exposed

57:05.924 --> 57:08.024
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...

57:08.184 --> 57:12.021
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...

57:13.348 --> 57:15.517
its molecular integrity
could fail.

57:16.059 --> 57:18.311
Yeah, and you with it.

57:18.770 --> 57:20.316
We're not having
this conversation.

57:20.476 --> 57:22.398
Eliminating the stone
is the only way

57:22.482 --> 57:24.484
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.

57:25.026 --> 57:27.237
That's too high a price.

57:31.741 --> 57:34.119
Only you have
the power to pay it.

57:38.373 --> 57:40.416
Thanos threatens
half the universe.

57:40.583 --> 57:43.128
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.

57:43.294 --> 57:44.712
But it should.

57:47.148 --> 57:48.598
We don't trade lives, Vision.

57:48.758 --> 57:50.725
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

57:50.885 --> 57:52.679
to save how many
millions of people?

57:52.846 --> 57:54.889
Tell me,
why is this any different?

57:55.056 --> 57:57.350
Because you might
have a choice.

57:58.643 --> 57:59.978
Your mind is made up

58:00.061 --> 58:02.438
of a complex construct
of overlays.

58:02.605 --> 58:06.192
Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.

58:06.359 --> 58:08.111
All of them mixed together,

58:08.194 --> 58:10.044
all of them
learning from one another.

58:10.419 --> 58:12.469
You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?

58:12.629 --> 58:15.076
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...

58:15.243 --> 58:16.661
there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.

58:16.744 --> 58:18.204
Perhaps the best parts.

58:18.538 --> 58:19.873
Can we do that?

58:20.582 --> 58:21.624
Not me, not here.

58:22.625 --> 58:24.169
Well,
you better find someone

58:24.252 --> 58:25.420
and somewhere fast.

58:25.587 --> 58:27.237
Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys

58:27.397 --> 58:28.647
have your old rooms back.

58:31.301 --> 58:32.886
I know somewhere.

58:47.525 --> 58:48.776
The Kingsguard

58:48.860 --> 58:50.542
and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.

58:50.702 --> 58:51.863
And the Border Tribe?

58:52.322 --> 58:53.907
Those that are left.

58:54.199 --> 58:56.326
Send word
to the Jabari as well.

58:56.492 --> 58:58.578
M'Baku likes a good fight.

59:00.872 --> 59:02.582
And what of this one?

59:03.208 --> 59:05.335
This one may be tired of war.

59:05.668 --> 59:08.713
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.

59:31.361 --> 59:32.946
Where's the fight?

59:33.863 --> 59:35.281
On its way.

59:53.675 --> 59:56.261
In all the time
I've served Thanos...

59:58.137 --> 01:00:00.139
I have never failed him.

01:00:05.228 --> 01:00:08.314
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan...

01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:10.131
with the Time Stone
still attached

01:00:10.291 --> 01:00:12.318
to your vaguely
irritating person...

01:00:12.485 --> 01:00:15.071
there would be judgment.

01:00:23.663 --> 01:00:25.206
Give me...

01:00:29.043 --> 01:00:30.044
the stone.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.891
Wow, you're a seriously

01:00:43.975 --> 01:00:45.612
loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?

01:00:45.772 --> 01:00:47.228
Yeah, uh,
speaking of loyalty...

01:00:47.812 --> 01:00:48.813
What the...

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:50.738
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.

01:00:50.898 --> 01:00:51.948
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.

01:00:52.108 --> 01:00:53.109
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought

01:00:53.192 --> 01:00:54.444
- about you on the way...
- And now I gotta hear it.

01:00:54.527 --> 01:00:55.535
...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.

01:00:55.695 --> 01:00:58.014
And this suit is ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

01:00:58.174 --> 01:00:58.906
God damn it.

01:00:59.073 --> 01:01:01.868
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.

01:01:02.035 --> 01:01:03.376
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

01:01:03.536 --> 01:01:04.886
And now, I'm here in space.

01:01:05.046 --> 01:01:07.415
Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.

01:01:07.582 --> 01:01:09.764
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.

01:01:09.924 --> 01:01:11.085
This is a one-way ticket.

01:01:11.169 --> 01:01:12.712
You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.

01:01:12.795 --> 01:01:13.796
No, I did think this through.

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:15.513
You could not have possibly
thought this through.

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:18.123
You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...

01:01:18.283 --> 01:01:19.867
if there's no neighborhood.

01:01:21.095 --> 01:01:22.845
Okay, that didn't really make sense,

01:01:23.005 --> 01:01:24.755
but you know what I'm trying to say.

01:01:25.767 --> 01:01:28.644
Come on. We got a situation.

01:01:29.645 --> 01:01:30.646
See him down there?
He's in trouble.

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:31.731
What's your plan?

01:01:31.814 --> 01:01:32.982
- Go.
- Um...

01:01:33.649 --> 01:01:35.068
Okay, okay... Uh...

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:38.571
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, "Aliens"?

01:01:42.283 --> 01:01:44.369
Painful, aren't they?

01:01:45.161 --> 01:01:48.122
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

01:01:48.790 --> 01:01:50.875
And any one of them...

01:01:55.963 --> 01:01:58.174
could end your friend's life
in an instant.

01:01:58.758 --> 01:02:00.908
¦I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.¦

01:02:01.068 --> 01:02:03.738
¦Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.¦

01:02:05.014 --> 01:02:06.766
You've saved nothing.

01:02:07.642 --> 01:02:09.644
Your powers are inconsequential

01:02:09.727 --> 01:02:10.937
compared to mine.

01:02:11.354 --> 01:02:13.154
Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.

01:02:27.161 --> 01:02:29.330
Yes! Wait. What are those?

01:02:44.971 --> 01:02:46.681
Hey, we haven't officially met.

01:02:47.974 --> 01:02:49.058
Cool.

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:52.520
We gotta turn this ship around.

01:02:52.645 --> 01:02:54.689
Yeah, now he wants to run.
Great plan.

01:02:54.856 --> 01:02:56.366
No, I want to protect the stone.

01:02:56.426 --> 01:02:57.699
And I want you to thank me.

01:02:57.783 --> 01:02:59.284
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

01:02:59.451 --> 01:03:02.071
For what? Nearly blasting me into space?

01:03:02.238 --> 01:03:04.490
Who just saved your magical ass? Me.

01:03:04.657 --> 01:03:05.658
I seriously don't know

01:03:05.741 --> 01:03:07.016
how you fit your head
into that helmet.

01:03:07.076 --> 01:03:09.435
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.

01:03:09.495 --> 01:03:11.145
I tried to bench you. You refused.

01:03:11.312 --> 01:03:13.237
Unlike everyone else in your life,
I don't work for you.

01:03:13.397 --> 01:03:14.834
And due to that fact,

01:03:14.917 --> 01:03:16.259
we're now in a flying doughnut...

01:03:16.419 --> 01:03:18.094
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.

01:03:18.254 --> 01:03:20.173
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.

01:03:20.339 --> 01:03:21.489
The adults are talking.

01:03:21.656 --> 01:03:24.242
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

01:03:24.409 --> 01:03:25.887
What is he, your ward?

01:03:26.053 --> 01:03:27.054
No.

01:03:27.555 --> 01:03:29.605
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

01:03:29.765 --> 01:03:31.765
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...

01:03:32.268 --> 01:03:33.478
I'm Spider-Man, then.

01:03:34.437 --> 01:03:36.210
This ship is
self-correcting its course.

01:03:36.294 --> 01:03:37.344
Thing's on autopilot.

01:03:37.504 --> 01:03:38.900
Can we control it?

01:03:39.066 --> 01:03:40.985
Fly us home?

01:03:43.988 --> 01:03:44.989
- Stark?
- Yeah.

01:03:45.156 --> 01:03:46.407
Can you get us home?

01:03:46.574 --> 01:03:47.825
Yeah, I heard you.

01:03:49.118 --> 01:03:51.579
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.

01:03:52.246 --> 01:03:53.748
Under no circumstances

01:03:53.831 --> 01:03:56.375
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.

01:03:56.542 --> 01:03:57.710
I don't think
you quite understand

01:03:57.793 --> 01:03:58.843
what's at stake here.

01:03:59.003 --> 01:04:01.297
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

01:04:01.464 --> 01:04:04.217
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

01:04:04.383 --> 01:04:05.983
Since he sent an army
to New York

01:04:06.143 --> 01:04:07.595
and now he's back.

01:04:07.762 --> 01:04:09.680
And I don't know what to do.

01:04:09.847 --> 01:04:11.015
So I'm not so sure

01:04:11.098 --> 01:04:13.848
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

01:04:14.008 --> 01:04:16.687
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

01:04:16.854 --> 01:04:19.065
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

01:04:19.232 --> 01:04:21.984
So I say we take
the fight to him.

01:04:22.151 --> 01:04:23.152
Doctor.

01:04:24.862 --> 01:04:26.531
Do you concur?

01:04:28.991 --> 01:04:31.577
All right, Stark.
We go to him.

01:04:32.662 --> 01:04:34.705
But you have to understand...

01:04:34.872 --> 01:04:36.541
if it comes to saving you

01:04:36.624 --> 01:04:39.085
or the kid
or the Time Stone...

01:04:39.252 --> 01:04:42.088
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

01:04:42.922 --> 01:04:46.592
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

01:04:47.176 --> 01:04:50.054
Nice. Good, moral compass.

01:04:51.347 --> 01:04:52.848
We're straight.

01:04:53.975 --> 01:04:55.476
All right, kid.

01:04:56.769 --> 01:04:57.869
You're an Avenger now.

01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:36.684
I thought
you might be hungry.

01:05:48.821 --> 01:05:50.364
I always hated that chair.

01:05:50.573 --> 01:05:52.617
So I've been told.

01:05:53.284 --> 01:05:57.204
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

01:05:57.955 --> 01:05:59.457
I hated this room.

01:06:00.374 --> 01:06:01.667
This ship.

01:06:01.834 --> 01:06:03.628
I hated my life.

01:06:08.049 --> 01:06:10.301
You told me that too.

01:06:13.471 --> 01:06:14.847
Every day.

01:06:17.642 --> 01:06:19.602
For almost 20 years.

01:06:22.146 --> 01:06:24.565
I was a child
when you took me.

01:06:25.441 --> 01:06:26.734
I saved you.

01:06:30.279 --> 01:06:31.280
No.

01:06:32.782 --> 01:06:36.285
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

01:06:36.494 --> 01:06:37.620
Going to bed hungry...

01:06:38.162 --> 01:06:39.830
scrounging for scraps.

01:06:40.039 --> 01:06:42.917
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.044
I'm the one who stopped that.

01:06:45.544 --> 01:06:47.444
Do you know
what's happened since then?

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:49.231
The children born...

01:06:49.799 --> 01:06:53.177
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

01:06:53.344 --> 01:06:54.595
It's a paradise.

01:06:57.264 --> 01:06:59.141
Because you murdered
half the planet.

01:06:59.266 --> 01:07:02.144
A small price to pay
for salvation.

01:07:02.353 --> 01:07:03.354
You're insane.

01:07:03.521 --> 01:07:05.481
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.

01:07:05.606 --> 01:07:08.401
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

01:07:08.984 --> 01:07:12.947
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

01:07:13.406 --> 01:07:14.490
It needs correction.

01:07:14.615 --> 01:07:15.991
You don't know that!

01:07:17.576 --> 01:07:19.578
I'm the only one
who knows that.

01:07:20.413 --> 01:07:24.583
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:27.753
For a time...

01:07:29.797 --> 01:07:34.051
you had that same will...

01:07:35.636 --> 01:07:38.055
as you fought by my side.

01:07:38.931 --> 01:07:39.974
Daughter.

01:07:40.766 --> 01:07:42.560
I'm not your daughter.

01:07:44.937 --> 01:07:47.690
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

01:07:48.524 --> 01:07:49.942
And, in doing so,

01:07:50.025 --> 01:07:52.236
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

01:07:55.197 --> 01:07:57.992
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

01:08:01.412 --> 01:08:03.873
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

01:08:05.374 --> 01:08:07.168
I am disappointed.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.421
But not because
you didn't find it.

01:08:14.133 --> 01:08:15.760
But because you did.

01:08:17.219 --> 01:08:18.970
And you lied.

01:08:36.071 --> 01:08:37.198
Nebula.

01:08:44.455 --> 01:08:45.790
Don't do this.

01:08:45.956 --> 01:08:47.166
Some time ago,

01:08:47.249 --> 01:08:49.960
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.

01:08:50.127 --> 01:08:51.176
Please don't do this.

01:08:51.337 --> 01:08:53.631
And very nearly succeeded.

01:08:54.173 --> 01:08:55.633
So I brought her here.

01:08:57.176 --> 01:08:58.426
To talk.

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:08.479
Stop. Stop it.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:16.694
I swear to you on my life.

01:09:17.196 --> 01:09:19.490
I never found the Soul Stone.

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:25.203
¦Accessing memory files.¦

01:09:25.371 --> 01:09:26.734
¦You know
what he's about to do.¦

01:09:26.895 --> 01:09:29.457
¦He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.¦

01:09:29.625 --> 01:09:30.751
¦- All of them.
- He can never get them all.¦

01:09:30.876 --> 01:09:31.877
¦He will!¦

01:09:31.961 --> 01:09:33.921
¦He can't, Nebula.¦

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:36.423
¦Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...¦

01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:39.385
¦and I burned it to ash. I burned it.¦

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.225
You're strong.

01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:49.270
Me.

01:09:51.856 --> 01:09:53.439
You're generous.

01:09:54.775 --> 01:09:55.776
Me.

01:09:57.778 --> 01:10:00.197
But I never taught you to lie.

01:10:00.364 --> 01:10:02.992
That's why you're so bad at it.

01:10:05.202 --> 01:10:09.748
Where is the Soul Stone?

01:10:27.141 --> 01:10:28.726
Vormir!

01:10:46.285 --> 01:10:47.870
The stone is on Vormir.

01:10:51.206 --> 01:10:53.375
Show me.

01:10:55.461 --> 01:10:56.795
I am Groot.

01:10:56.962 --> 01:10:58.088
Tinkle in the cup.

01:10:58.172 --> 01:10:59.613
We're not looking. What's there to see?

01:10:59.673 --> 01:11:01.923
What's a twig?
Everybody's seen a twig before.

01:11:02.083 --> 01:11:03.093
I am Groot.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.303
Tree, pour what's in the cup

01:11:04.386 --> 01:11:06.286
out into space
and go in the cup again.

01:11:06.446 --> 01:11:07.389
You speak Groot?

01:11:07.556 --> 01:11:09.784
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

01:11:09.844 --> 01:11:10.659
I am Groot.

01:11:10.726 --> 01:11:12.728
You'll know when we're close.

01:11:12.895 --> 01:11:14.480
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

01:11:14.563 --> 01:11:16.774
the blazing power of a neutron star.

01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:21.612
It's the birthplace of my hammer.

01:11:22.321 --> 01:11:24.073
It's truly awesome.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.248
Okay, time to be the captain.

01:11:38.253 --> 01:11:39.797
So, dead brother, huh?

01:11:40.464 --> 01:11:42.299
Yeah, that could be annoying.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.677
Well, he's been dead before.

01:11:46.136 --> 01:11:48.681
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.

01:11:49.139 --> 01:11:51.475
And you said your sister and your dad?

01:11:51.642 --> 01:11:52.935
Both dead.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.229
But still got a mom, though?

01:11:55.729 --> 01:11:56.981
Killed by a dark elf.

01:11:57.147 --> 01:11:58.148
A best friend?

01:11:58.273 --> 01:11:59.608
Stabbed through the heart.

01:12:02.987 --> 01:12:06.156
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?

01:12:08.409 --> 01:12:09.868
Absolutely.

01:12:10.035 --> 01:12:13.539
Rage and vengeance, anger,
loss, regret...

01:12:13.706 --> 01:12:15.356
they're all tremendous motivators.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:16.790
They really clear the mind.

01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:18.168
So I'm good to go.

01:12:18.836 --> 01:12:21.005
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talkin' about...

01:12:21.463 --> 01:12:23.757
he's the toughest there is.

01:12:23.924 --> 01:12:26.124
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

01:12:26.284 --> 01:12:27.827
He's never fought me twice.

01:12:28.303 --> 01:12:30.403
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.

01:12:30.563 --> 01:12:32.815
It better be some hammer.

01:12:36.603 --> 01:12:38.981
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

01:12:39.648 --> 01:12:41.698
I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.

01:12:41.859 --> 01:12:43.996
And every one of them
would've rather killed me,

01:12:44.156 --> 01:12:45.157
but none succeeded.

01:12:45.571 --> 01:12:48.490
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.

01:12:48.657 --> 01:12:51.452
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...

01:12:51.618 --> 01:12:53.818
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.

01:12:53.978 --> 01:12:55.456
Fate wills it so.

01:12:55.539 --> 01:12:56.874
Mmm-hmm.

01:12:56.957 --> 01:12:58.792
And what if you're wrong?

01:13:02.087 --> 01:13:03.881
If I'm wrong, then...

01:13:05.174 --> 01:13:06.717
what more could I lose?

01:13:20.522 --> 01:13:21.899
I could lose a lot.

01:13:21.982 --> 01:13:24.109
Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.

01:13:27.905 --> 01:13:28.906
Okay.

01:13:31.834 --> 01:13:34.084
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...

01:13:34.244 --> 01:13:35.961
you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.

01:13:36.121 --> 01:13:38.123
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

01:13:38.457 --> 01:13:40.876
Some jerk lost a bet with me
on Contraxia.

01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:42.294
He gave you his eye?

01:13:42.461 --> 01:13:43.811
No, he gave me 100 credits.

01:13:43.971 --> 01:13:46.932
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

01:13:48.634 --> 01:13:49.885
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

01:13:49.968 --> 01:13:51.011
Hmm..

01:13:53.514 --> 01:13:55.015
Huh?

01:13:56.809 --> 01:13:57.851
Oh.

01:13:58.185 --> 01:14:00.854
I would've washed that.

01:14:00.938 --> 01:14:03.688
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was up my...

01:14:04.775 --> 01:14:05.859
Hey, we're here!

01:14:09.863 --> 01:14:11.363
I don't think
this thing works.

01:14:11.523 --> 01:14:12.691
Everything seems dark.

01:14:14.785 --> 01:14:16.495
It ain't the eye.

01:14:29.842 --> 01:14:31.218
Something's wrong.

01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:33.554
The star's gone out.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.973
And the rings are frozen.

01:14:57.079 --> 01:14:58.579
I hope
these dwarves are better

01:14:58.662 --> 01:15:00.414
at forging
than they are cleaning.

01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:07.319
Maybe they realized
that they live

01:15:07.402 --> 01:15:09.252
in a junk pile
in the middle of space.

01:15:09.412 --> 01:15:12.309
This forge hasn't gone dark
in centuries.

01:15:14.178 --> 01:15:16.805
You said Thanos
had a gauntlet, right?

01:15:16.972 --> 01:15:18.140
Yes, why?

01:15:18.307 --> 01:15:20.350
It look
anything like that?

01:15:23.770 --> 01:15:25.522
I am Groot.

01:15:25.689 --> 01:15:27.191
Go back to the pod.

01:15:31.195 --> 01:15:32.237
Eitri, wait!

01:15:33.238 --> 01:15:34.239
Stop!

01:15:35.157 --> 01:15:36.158
Stop.

01:15:36.867 --> 01:15:37.868
Thor?

01:15:41.205 --> 01:15:42.581
What happened here?

01:15:42.998 --> 01:15:45.292
You were supposed
to protect us.

01:15:46.210 --> 01:15:48.837
Asgard was supposed
to protect us.

01:15:49.004 --> 01:15:51.215
Asgard is destroyed.

01:15:53.467 --> 01:15:57.304
Eitri, the glove.
What did you do?

01:16:10.067 --> 01:16:13.070
300 dwarves
lived on this ring.

01:16:14.446 --> 01:16:17.366
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

01:16:19.868 --> 01:16:21.328
I made what he wanted.

01:16:23.038 --> 01:16:27.376
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

01:16:31.922 --> 01:16:34.508
Then he killed
everyone anyway.

01:16:36.593 --> 01:16:38.387
All except me.

01:16:39.471 --> 01:16:41.348
"Your life is yours," he said.

01:16:42.641 --> 01:16:46.603
"But your hands are mine alone."

01:16:47.562 --> 01:16:49.564
Eitri, this isn't about
your hands.

01:16:50.691 --> 01:16:52.341
Every weapon
you've ever designed,

01:16:52.424 --> 01:16:53.842
every axe, hammer, sword...

01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:56.154
it's all inside your head.

01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:59.130
Now, I know it feels
like all hope is lost.

01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:00.659
Trust me, I know.

01:17:01.118 --> 01:17:05.831
But together, you and I,
we can kill Thanos.

01:17:46.330 --> 01:17:48.623
Mantis, listen very carefully.

01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:51.001
I need you
to meet me on Titan.

01:17:57.549 --> 01:17:58.675
Hey, what's going on?

01:17:58.842 --> 01:18:00.052
I think we're here.

01:18:00.218 --> 01:18:02.679
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

01:18:04.431 --> 01:18:06.431
Get your hand
inside the steering gimbal.

01:18:06.591 --> 01:18:07.691
Close those around it.

01:18:08.769 --> 01:18:09.818
- You understand?
- Yep, got it.

01:18:09.978 --> 01:18:12.078
This was meant for
one big guy, so we gotta

01:18:12.238 --> 01:18:14.438
- move at the same time.
- Okay, okay. Ready.

01:18:17.444 --> 01:18:18.653
We might wanna turn.

01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:20.072
Turn! Turn! Turn!

01:18:50.018 --> 01:18:51.520
You all right?

01:18:52.562 --> 01:18:54.272
That was close.

01:18:55.649 --> 01:18:56.900
I owe you one.

01:18:57.401 --> 01:18:59.486
Let me just say, if aliens

01:18:59.569 --> 01:19:01.328
wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something...

01:19:01.488 --> 01:19:02.621
and I eat one of you,
I'm sorry.

01:19:02.781 --> 01:19:05.117
I do not want another
single pop culture reference

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.750
out of you for the rest
of the trip. You understand?

01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:10.010
I'm trying to say
that something is coming.

01:19:15.752 --> 01:19:16.837
Thanos!

01:19:37.649 --> 01:19:40.149
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't
put your eggs in me!

01:19:41.153 --> 01:19:43.613
Stay down, clown.

01:19:48.827 --> 01:19:50.912
Die, blanket of death!

01:19:56.835 --> 01:19:59.754
Everybody stay where
you are. Chill the eff out.

01:20:00.964 --> 01:20:02.966
I'm gonna ask you
this one time.

01:20:03.717 --> 01:20:04.968
Where is Gamora?

01:20:05.135 --> 01:20:07.637
Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

01:20:07.929 --> 01:20:10.724
I'll do you one better.
Why is Gamora?

01:20:10.891 --> 01:20:12.809
Tell me where the girl is
or I swear to you

01:20:12.893 --> 01:20:14.621
I'm gonna French fry
this little freak.

01:20:14.781 --> 01:20:17.681
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!

01:20:18.201 --> 01:20:20.317
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

01:20:20.484 --> 01:20:22.492
- No, he can't take it!
- She's right. You can't.

01:20:22.652 --> 01:20:24.703
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell
me where she is? That's fine.

01:20:24.863 --> 01:20:25.906
I'll kill all three of you

01:20:25.989 --> 01:20:27.839
and I'll beat it
out of Thanos myself.

01:20:27.999 --> 01:20:28.992
Starting with you.

01:20:29.075 --> 01:20:30.160
Wait, what, Thanos?

01:20:30.243 --> 01:20:32.329
All right, let me ask you
this one time.

01:20:32.829 --> 01:20:34.498
What master do you serve?

01:20:34.664 --> 01:20:35.916
What master do I serve?

01:20:35.999 --> 01:20:37.699
What am I supposed to say,
"Jesus"?

01:20:38.376 --> 01:20:39.377
You're from Earth.

01:20:39.461 --> 01:20:40.545
I'm not from Earth,
I'm from Missouri.

01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:42.129
Yeah, that's on Earth,
dipshit.

01:20:42.296 --> 01:20:43.746
What are you hassling us for?

01:20:43.829 --> 01:20:45.498
So you're not
with Thanos?

01:20:45.957 --> 01:20:47.385
With Thanos?

01:20:47.969 --> 01:20:50.555
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

01:20:50.722 --> 01:20:52.557
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?

01:20:53.391 --> 01:20:55.101
- We're the Avengers, man.
- Oh.

01:20:55.185 --> 01:20:57.479
You're the ones
Thor told us about.

01:20:57.646 --> 01:20:58.813
You know Thor?

01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:00.065
Yeah.

01:21:00.148 --> 01:21:02.609
Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.

01:21:02.776 --> 01:21:04.444
Where is he now?

01:21:19.501 --> 01:21:21.774
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?

01:21:21.934 --> 01:21:23.143
It's a mold.

01:21:23.505 --> 01:21:24.506
A king's weapon.

01:21:25.465 --> 01:21:27.801
Meant to be
the greatest in Asgard.

01:21:28.426 --> 01:21:31.304
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.

01:21:31.471 --> 01:21:32.931
Did it have a name?

01:21:34.182 --> 01:21:35.350
Stormbreaker.

01:21:35.809 --> 01:21:36.935
That's a bit much.

01:21:38.979 --> 01:21:40.063
So how do we make it?

01:21:41.898 --> 01:21:44.109
You'll have to restart the forge.

01:21:45.068 --> 01:21:47.279
Awaken the heart of a dying star.

01:21:49.906 --> 01:21:52.534
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

01:21:56.204 --> 01:21:58.164
The hell happened to this planet?

01:21:58.331 --> 01:22:00.125
It's eight degrees off its axis.

01:22:00.208 --> 01:22:02.419
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.

01:22:03.753 --> 01:22:06.548
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

01:22:07.507 --> 01:22:10.135
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.

01:22:10.302 --> 01:22:11.660
Or at least the beginnings of one.

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:13.054
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,

01:22:13.138 --> 01:22:14.502
pin him down,
get what we need.

01:22:14.662 --> 01:22:16.614
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.

01:22:16.698 --> 01:22:17.998
We just want the gauntlet.

01:22:18.324 --> 01:22:20.270
Are you yawning?

01:22:20.353 --> 01:22:22.622
In the middle of this,
while I'm breaking it down? Huh?

01:22:22.647 --> 01:22:23.897
Did you hear what I said?

01:22:24.482 --> 01:22:26.846
I stopped listening after you said,
"We need a plan".

01:22:27.006 --> 01:22:28.597
Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

01:22:28.757 --> 01:22:30.989
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.

01:22:31.156 --> 01:22:32.956
Uh, what exactly is it that they do?

01:22:33.116 --> 01:22:34.409
Kick names, take ass.

01:22:34.576 --> 01:22:35.827
Yeah, that's right.

01:22:42.542 --> 01:22:44.224
All right, just get over here,
please.

01:22:44.384 --> 01:22:46.544
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?

01:22:46.704 --> 01:22:48.873
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

01:22:51.259 --> 01:22:52.552
We gotta coalesce.

01:22:52.719 --> 01:22:55.265
'Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

01:22:55.425 --> 01:22:56.806
Dude, don't call us plucky.

01:22:56.973 --> 01:22:58.373
We don't know what it means.

01:22:58.558 --> 01:23:01.144
All right, we're optimistic, yes.
I like your plan.

01:23:01.311 --> 01:23:03.772
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...

01:23:03.938 --> 01:23:05.857
and that way it might be really good.

01:23:06.024 --> 01:23:08.474
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

01:23:08.634 --> 01:23:10.278
- What dance-off?
- It's nothing.

01:23:10.445 --> 01:23:11.764
Like in "Footloose", the movie?

01:23:11.924 --> 01:23:13.031
Exactly like "Footloose".

01:23:13.573 --> 01:23:15.437
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?

01:23:15.597 --> 01:23:16.368
It never was.

01:23:16.534 --> 01:23:17.577
Don't encourage this, all right?

01:23:17.661 --> 01:23:18.953
- Okay.
- We're getting no help

01:23:19.037 --> 01:23:20.622
- from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?

01:23:20.705 --> 01:23:22.255
By the way, that's a compliment.

01:23:22.415 --> 01:23:23.917
Don't forget, I'm half human.

01:23:24.084 --> 01:23:25.734
So that 50% of me that's stupid...

01:23:26.836 --> 01:23:27.837
that's 100% you.

01:23:28.004 --> 01:23:29.404
Your math is blowing my mind.

01:23:29.564 --> 01:23:30.857
Excuse me.

01:23:31.633 --> 01:23:35.053
But does your friend often do that?

01:23:36.471 --> 01:23:38.765
Strange, we all right?

01:23:49.067 --> 01:23:50.567
You're back. You're all right.

01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:52.443
- Hi.
- Hey, what was that?

01:23:52.944 --> 01:23:56.157
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

01:23:57.026 --> 01:23:58.576
To see all the possible outcomes

01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:00.495
of the coming conflict.

01:24:01.246 --> 01:24:02.580
How many did you see?

01:24:02.747 --> 01:24:04.999
14,000,605.

01:24:06.668 --> 01:24:08.086
How many did we win?

01:24:12.841 --> 01:24:14.008
One.

01:24:35.905 --> 01:24:38.908
The stone had better be up there.

01:24:40.785 --> 01:24:42.829
For your sister's sake.

01:25:03.725 --> 01:25:08.480
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

01:25:10.565 --> 01:25:13.818
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

01:25:13.985 --> 01:25:15.153
You know us?

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:19.866
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.

01:25:20.366 --> 01:25:22.035
Where is the Soul Stone?

01:25:22.744 --> 01:25:24.412
You should know...

01:25:25.079 --> 01:25:28.208
it extracts a terrible price.

01:25:29.542 --> 01:25:31.127
I am prepared.

01:25:33.588 --> 01:25:36.007
We all think that at first.

01:25:40.553 --> 01:25:42.847
We are all wrong.

01:25:54.442 --> 01:25:56.778
How is it you know this place so well?

01:25:56.945 --> 01:26:01.282
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.

01:26:01.741 --> 01:26:04.452
I even held one in my hand.

01:26:04.619 --> 01:26:08.665
But it cast me out,
banished me here.

01:26:08.832 --> 01:26:12.877
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.

01:26:21.594 --> 01:26:24.514
What you seek
lies in front of you.

01:26:25.473 --> 01:26:27.600
As does what you fear.

01:26:28.351 --> 01:26:29.811
What's this?

01:26:30.311 --> 01:26:31.855
The price.

01:26:32.021 --> 01:26:36.651
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

01:26:37.652 --> 01:26:41.739
You might say it has a certain wisdom.

01:26:43.116 --> 01:26:44.951
Tell me what it needs.

01:26:45.118 --> 01:26:48.663
To ensure that whoever possesses it...

01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:51.374
understands its power...

01:26:52.333 --> 01:26:56.087
the stone demands a sacrifice.

01:26:56.254 --> 01:26:57.797
Of what?

01:26:58.214 --> 01:27:00.174
In order to take the stone,

01:27:00.258 --> 01:27:02.677
you must lose that which you love.

01:27:05.597 --> 01:27:06.890
A soul...

01:27:07.557 --> 01:27:08.808
for a soul.

01:27:24.532 --> 01:27:26.868
All my life, I dreamed of a day...

01:27:27.827 --> 01:27:29.203
a moment...

01:27:30.538 --> 01:27:32.624
when you got what you deserved.

01:27:34.834 --> 01:27:37.128
And I was always so disappointed.

01:27:40.715 --> 01:27:42.175
But now...

01:27:46.137 --> 01:27:49.223
You kill and torture...

01:27:51.184 --> 01:27:53.186
and you call it mercy.

01:27:57.273 --> 01:27:59.359
The universe has judged you.

01:28:00.944 --> 01:28:05.406
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:08.451
You failed.

01:28:09.827 --> 01:28:11.704
And do you wanna know why?

01:28:12.664 --> 01:28:14.499
Because you love nothing.

01:28:15.208 --> 01:28:16.834
No one.

01:28:22.465 --> 01:28:23.633
No.

01:28:28.262 --> 01:28:29.263
Really?

01:28:30.306 --> 01:28:31.391
Tears?

01:28:32.183 --> 01:28:34.143
They're not for him.

01:28:48.408 --> 01:28:49.617
No.

01:28:51.119 --> 01:28:52.537
This isn't love.

01:28:53.413 --> 01:28:56.082
I ignored my destiny once.

01:28:58.543 --> 01:29:00.712
I cannot do that again.

01:29:01.212 --> 01:29:04.590
Even for you.

01:29:28.781 --> 01:29:31.159
I'm sorry, little one.

01:29:34.996 --> 01:29:36.247
No!

01:31:13.845 --> 01:31:16.681
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

01:31:16.848 --> 01:31:18.348
I hope you're right about this.

01:31:18.508 --> 01:31:21.386
Or we're gonna land
a lot faster than you want to.

01:31:36.868 --> 01:31:38.244
When you said we were going
to open Wakanda

01:31:38.327 --> 01:31:39.677
to the rest of the world...

01:31:39.837 --> 01:31:41.789
this is not what I imagined.

01:31:41.956 --> 01:31:43.916
And what did you imagine?

01:31:44.083 --> 01:31:45.209
The Olympics.

01:31:45.376 --> 01:31:47.128
Maybe even a Starbucks.

01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:02.727
Should we bow?

01:32:02.894 --> 01:32:04.145
Yeah, he's a king.

01:32:04.478 --> 01:32:06.878
Seems like I'm always thanking you
for something.

01:32:07.648 --> 01:32:09.775
What are you doing?

01:32:09.859 --> 01:32:11.861
Uh, we don't do that here.

01:32:12.028 --> 01:32:14.280
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

01:32:14.447 --> 01:32:17.450
Uh, sir, I think you should expect
quite a big assault.

01:32:17.617 --> 01:32:18.618
How we looking?

01:32:18.701 --> 01:32:20.661
You will have my Kingsguard,

01:32:20.745 --> 01:32:23.706
the Border Tribe,
the Dora Milaje, and...

01:32:24.665 --> 01:32:27.585
And a semi-stable 100-year-old man.

01:32:30.463 --> 01:32:31.631
How you been, Buck?

01:32:31.797 --> 01:32:34.926
Uh, not bad, for the end of the world.

01:32:46.979 --> 01:32:48.022
Whoa.

01:32:48.105 --> 01:32:50.191
The structure is polymorphic.

01:32:50.650 --> 01:32:53.527
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.

01:32:53.945 --> 01:32:55.780
Why didn't you just reprogram

01:32:55.863 --> 01:32:57.990
the synapses to work collectively?

01:32:59.075 --> 01:33:02.328
Because we didn't think of it.

01:33:02.745 --> 01:33:04.095
I'm sure you did your best.

01:33:04.255 --> 01:33:05.464
Can you do it?

01:33:06.332 --> 01:33:09.627
Yes, but there are more than
two trillion neurons here.

01:33:09.794 --> 01:33:12.964
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.

01:33:13.339 --> 01:33:14.689
It will take time, brother.

01:33:16.133 --> 01:33:17.176
How long?

01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:18.610
As long as you can give me.

01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:25.351
Something's entered the atmosphere.

01:33:42.201 --> 01:33:44.495
Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.

01:33:54.005 --> 01:33:55.840
God, I love this place.

01:33:56.007 --> 01:33:58.557
¦Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys.¦

01:33:58.717 --> 01:34:00.635
¦We got more incoming
outside the dome.¦

01:34:18.863 --> 01:34:19.947
It's too late.

01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:22.590
We need to destroy the stone now.

01:34:22.825 --> 01:34:24.725
Vision, get your ass back on the table.

01:34:24.891 --> 01:34:26.226
We will hold them off.

01:34:26.393 --> 01:34:29.540
Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head...

01:34:29.707 --> 01:34:30.708
you blow it to hell.

01:34:31.125 --> 01:34:32.209
I will.

01:34:32.376 --> 01:34:35.171
Evacuate the city.
Engage all defenses.

01:34:35.921 --> 01:34:37.381
And get this man a shield.

01:34:47.808 --> 01:34:48.893
¦I don't think¦

01:34:48.976 --> 01:34:50.309
¦you get the scientifics here.¦

01:34:50.369 --> 01:34:52.837
¦These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving...¦

01:34:52.897 --> 01:34:54.373
¦you're gonna need something
a lot bigger¦

01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:55.422
¦to yank 'em loose.¦

01:34:55.566 --> 01:34:57.610
- Leave that to me.
¦- Leave it to you?¦

01:34:57.777 --> 01:35:00.905
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...

01:35:09.330 --> 01:35:10.331
«Fire the engines!»

01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:30.559
More power, rabbit!

01:36:02.007 --> 01:36:03.801
Well done, boy.

01:36:05.594 --> 01:36:07.513
That's Nidavellir.

01:36:27.575 --> 01:36:28.576
Damn it.

01:36:28.993 --> 01:36:30.536
"Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

01:36:30.703 --> 01:36:32.121
«The mechanism is crippled.»

01:36:32.204 --> 01:36:33.622
- What?
- With the iris closed,

01:36:33.706 --> 01:36:34.856
I can't heat the metal.

01:36:35.016 --> 01:36:36.616
How long will it take to heat it?

01:36:36.776 --> 01:36:39.153
A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

01:36:41.046 --> 01:36:42.196
I'm gonna hold it open.

01:36:42.356 --> 01:36:43.382
That's suicide.

01:36:43.549 --> 01:36:45.968
So is facing Thanos without that axe.

01:36:55.769 --> 01:36:56.869
How we looking, Bruce?

01:36:57.029 --> 01:36:59.029
Yeah, I think
I'm getting the hang of it.

01:37:01.942 --> 01:37:04.028
Wow! This is amazing, man.

01:37:04.111 --> 01:37:06.261
It's like being the Hulk
without actually...

01:37:09.867 --> 01:37:12.077
¦I'm okay. I'm okay.¦

01:37:13.579 --> 01:37:14.979
I've got two heat signatures

01:37:15.139 --> 01:37:16.639
breaking through the tree line.

01:37:44.109 --> 01:37:46.320
Thank you for standing with us.

01:37:46.779 --> 01:37:47.780
Of course, brother.

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:09.927
Where's your other friend?

01:38:10.678 --> 01:38:13.055
You will pay for his life with yours.

01:38:14.056 --> 01:38:16.225
Thanos will have that stone.

01:38:17.017 --> 01:38:18.477
That's not gonna happen.

01:38:18.644 --> 01:38:20.938
You are in Wakanda now.

01:38:21.105 --> 01:38:24.567
Thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood.

01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:29.697
We have blood to spare.

01:38:41.125 --> 01:38:42.668
They surrender?

01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:44.461
Not exactly.

01:39:11.488 --> 01:39:12.906
What the hell?

01:39:15.868 --> 01:39:17.494
Looks like we pissed her off.

01:39:28.255 --> 01:39:29.798
They're killing themselves.

01:40:05.978 --> 01:40:07.628
You see the teeth on those things?

01:40:07.711 --> 01:40:08.911
All right, back up, Sam.

01:40:09.071 --> 01:40:10.771
You're gonna get your wings singed.

01:40:22.009 --> 01:40:23.727
¦Cap, if these things
circle the perimeter¦

01:40:23.811 --> 01:40:24.860
¦and get in behind us...¦

01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:26.970
¦there's nothing between them
and Vision.¦

01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:29.089
Then we better keep 'em in front of us.

01:40:29.249 --> 01:40:30.584
How do we do that?

01:40:32.861 --> 01:40:34.488
We open the barrier.

01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:40.869
On my signal, open North-West
Section Seventeen.

01:40:41.203 --> 01:40:43.080
¦Requesting confirmation, My King.¦

01:40:43.163 --> 01:40:44.832
¦You said open the barrier?¦

01:40:44.998 --> 01:40:46.208
On my signal.

01:40:46.458 --> 01:40:48.335
This will be the end of Wakanda.

01:40:49.670 --> 01:40:53.090
Then it will be the noblest ending
in history.

01:41:05.936 --> 01:41:07.521
Wakanda forever!

01:41:19.950 --> 01:41:20.951
Now!

01:41:51.273 --> 01:41:52.691
How much longer, Shuri?

01:41:52.858 --> 01:41:54.401
I've barely begun, brother.

01:41:54.568 --> 01:41:56.403
You might want to pick up the pace.

01:42:03.452 --> 01:42:05.329
Allfathers, give me strength.

01:42:05.496 --> 01:42:07.289
You understand, boy?

01:42:07.456 --> 01:42:10.459
You're about to take
the full force of a star.

01:42:11.418 --> 01:42:12.836
It'll kill you.

01:42:13.504 --> 01:42:15.714
Only if I die.

01:42:16.006 --> 01:42:17.007
Yes.

01:42:17.508 --> 01:42:20.260
That's what killing you means.

01:42:48.247 --> 01:42:50.165
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

01:43:40.632 --> 01:43:42.593
Thor! Say something. Come on.

01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:44.511
Thor, you okay?

01:43:50.183 --> 01:43:51.476
I think he's dying.

01:43:51.643 --> 01:43:53.604
He needs the axe!

01:43:55.063 --> 01:43:56.398
Where's the handle?

01:43:59.443 --> 01:44:01.778
Tree, help me find the handle!

01:45:10.639 --> 01:45:12.849
There's too many of 'em!

01:45:39.334 --> 01:45:42.671
You guys are so screwed now!

01:45:46.049 --> 01:45:48.051
Bring me Thanos!

01:46:20.792 --> 01:46:22.294
Oh, yeah.

01:46:25.422 --> 01:46:27.424
You're much more of a Thanos.

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:31.928
I take it the Maw is dead.

01:46:34.222 --> 01:46:36.683
This day extracts a heavy toll.

01:46:38.393 --> 01:46:40.562
Still, he accomplished his mission.

01:46:41.021 --> 01:46:42.522
You may regret that.

01:46:43.356 --> 01:46:44.733
He brought you face-to-face

01:46:44.816 --> 01:46:46.516
with the Master of the Mystic Arts.

01:46:49.404 --> 01:46:51.865
And where do you think he brought you?

01:46:52.949 --> 01:46:55.660
Let me guess. Your home?

01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:01.333
It was.

01:47:04.086 --> 01:47:05.504
And it was beautiful.

01:47:08.131 --> 01:47:10.592
Titan was like most planets.

01:47:10.759 --> 01:47:13.637
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.

01:47:13.804 --> 01:47:17.057
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

01:47:18.058 --> 01:47:19.267
Genocide.

01:47:19.976 --> 01:47:24.064
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.

01:47:25.398 --> 01:47:27.567
They called me a madman.

01:47:28.276 --> 01:47:30.529
And what I predicted came to pass.

01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:35.242
Congratulations, you're a prophet.

01:47:35.826 --> 01:47:37.035
I'm a survivor.

01:47:37.202 --> 01:47:39.412
Who wants to murder trillions.

01:47:39.579 --> 01:47:43.291
With all six stones,
I could simply snap my fingers.

01:47:43.834 --> 01:47:48.547
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

01:47:50.632 --> 01:47:52.134
And then what?

01:47:53.468 --> 01:47:54.970
I'd finally rest...

01:47:55.762 --> 01:47:58.890
and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

01:48:00.058 --> 01:48:03.603
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

01:48:04.437 --> 01:48:09.151
I think you'll find our will
equal to yours.

01:48:10.569 --> 01:48:11.570
Our?

01:48:17.659 --> 01:48:19.077
Piece of cake, Quill.

01:48:19.244 --> 01:48:21.496
Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.

01:48:59.659 --> 01:49:00.869
Boom!

01:49:01.119 --> 01:49:03.830
Don't let him close his fist.

01:49:08.043 --> 01:49:09.044
Magic.

01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:10.670
More magic.

01:49:11.504 --> 01:49:12.505
Magic with a kick.

01:49:13.131 --> 01:49:14.132
Magic with a...

01:49:15.467 --> 01:49:16.760
Insect!

01:49:54.172 --> 01:49:55.298
Well, well.

01:49:55.465 --> 01:49:56.665
You should've killed me.

01:49:56.825 --> 01:49:58.535
It would've been a waste of parts!

01:50:04.015 --> 01:50:05.141
Where's Gamora?

01:50:46.474 --> 01:50:47.724
¦Is he under? Don't let up.¦

01:50:47.884 --> 01:50:50.312
Be quick. He is very strong.

01:50:50.478 --> 01:50:52.522
Parker, help! Get over here.

01:50:52.689 --> 01:50:55.025
¦She can't hold him much longer.
Let's go.¦

01:50:59.788 --> 01:51:01.596
We gotta open his fingers
to get it off.

01:51:01.656 --> 01:51:03.256
I thought you'd be hard to catch.

01:51:03.416 --> 01:51:05.016
For the record, this was my plan.

01:51:05.410 --> 01:51:07.120
You're not so strong now, huh?

01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:09.372
Where is Gamora?

01:51:09.456 --> 01:51:11.416
My Gamora.

01:51:11.583 --> 01:51:13.626
No, bullshit!

01:51:13.918 --> 01:51:15.211
Where is she?

01:51:16.296 --> 01:51:17.589
He is in anguish.

01:51:18.298 --> 01:51:20.300
Good.

01:51:20.383 --> 01:51:22.719
He... He mourns.

01:51:23.261 --> 01:51:26.890
What does this monster have to mourn?

01:51:27.599 --> 01:51:28.683
Gamora.

01:51:32.562 --> 01:51:33.563
What?

01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:35.482
He took her to Vormir.

01:51:36.107 --> 01:51:38.068
He came back with the Soul Stone.

01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:40.362
But she didn't.

01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:45.450
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?

01:51:46.326 --> 01:51:49.788
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

01:51:51.039 --> 01:51:52.040
Tell me she's lying.

01:51:54.501 --> 01:51:57.295
Asshole, tell me you didn't do it!

01:51:58.755 --> 01:52:02.175
I had to.

01:52:02.926 --> 01:52:04.344
No, you didn't.

01:52:04.427 --> 01:52:06.221
No, you didn't.

01:52:10.058 --> 01:52:11.393
- No, you didn't!
- Quill!

01:52:11.559 --> 01:52:13.353
Hey, stop!
Hey, stop! Stop!

01:52:14.062 --> 01:52:15.063
¦Hey, stop! Stop!¦

01:52:15.188 --> 01:52:17.388
It's coming, it's coming.
I got it, I got it!

01:52:20.652 --> 01:52:21.653
Oh, God.

01:53:20.128 --> 01:53:23.214
Come and get some, space dogs!

01:53:26.551 --> 01:53:29.137
Come on! Get some! Get some!

01:53:29.304 --> 01:53:31.222
Come on! Get some!

01:53:31.473 --> 01:53:33.516
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

01:53:34.142 --> 01:53:36.019
Okay. How much for the arm?

01:53:37.896 --> 01:53:39.898
Oh, I'll get that arm.

01:53:48.781 --> 01:53:49.782
New haircut?

01:53:50.158 --> 01:53:51.658
Noticed you've copied my beard.

01:53:54.078 --> 01:53:56.178
By the way,
this is a friend of mine, Tree.

01:53:56.748 --> 01:53:58.666
I am Groot.

01:53:59.667 --> 01:54:01.127
I am Steve Rogers.

01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:23.358
Fall back! Fall back, now!

01:54:32.784 --> 01:54:34.684
Focus that fire on the left flank,
Sam.

01:54:35.078 --> 01:54:36.204
I'm doing it.

01:55:00.103 --> 01:55:01.803
Why was she up there all this time?

01:55:02.689 --> 01:55:05.567
She's on the field. Take it.

01:55:37.181 --> 01:55:39.309
Guys, we got a Vision situation here.

01:55:42.061 --> 01:55:43.438
Somebody get to Vision!

01:55:44.188 --> 01:55:45.982
¦- I got him.¦
- On my way.

01:55:51.362 --> 01:55:54.198
He'll die alone. As will you.

01:55:54.365 --> 01:55:55.658
She's not alone.

01:56:21.893 --> 01:56:23.603
¦Oh, no, you don't.¦

01:56:23.610 --> 01:56:25.376
This isn't gonna be like New York, pal.

01:56:25.396 --> 01:56:27.896
This suit's already kicked
the crap outta the Hulk.

01:56:28.056 --> 01:56:29.057
¦What? No! No!¦

01:56:32.612 --> 01:56:35.323
¦Guys! Vision needs backup, now!¦

01:56:37.325 --> 01:56:38.910
Hulk? Hulk,

01:56:38.993 --> 01:56:41.743
I know you like making your entrance
at the last second.

01:56:41.903 --> 01:56:44.530
Well, this is it, man.
This is the last, last second.

01:56:48.169 --> 01:56:49.712
Hulk! Hulk!

01:56:50.588 --> 01:56:51.589
Hulk!

01:56:52.757 --> 01:56:54.926
No!

01:56:55.093 --> 01:56:57.845
Oh, screw you, you big, green asshole!

01:56:58.012 --> 01:56:59.222
I'll do it myself!

01:57:00.139 --> 01:57:01.974
¦Come on! Yeah!¦

01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:15.905
¦See ya!¦

01:57:27.458 --> 01:57:29.961
Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.

01:57:41.013 --> 01:57:42.913
I thought you were formidable, machine.

01:57:43.850 --> 01:57:46.394
But you're dying, like any man.

01:57:54.986 --> 01:57:56.237
Get outta here!

01:57:59.657 --> 01:58:00.700
Go!

01:58:19.427 --> 01:58:21.095
That was really gross.

01:58:48.247 --> 01:58:49.597
I thought I told you to go.

01:58:50.875 --> 01:58:52.585
We don't trade lives, Captain.

01:59:04.138 --> 01:59:06.182
I got you. I got you.

01:59:06.432 --> 01:59:08.532
I'm sorry I can't remember
anybody's names.

01:59:53.688 --> 01:59:55.189
You're full of tricks, wizard.

01:59:57.275 --> 02:00:00.194
Yet you never once used
your greatest weapon.

02:00:03.614 --> 02:00:04.615
A fake.

02:00:12.582 --> 02:00:16.043
You throw another moon at me,
and I'm gonna lose it.

02:00:16.210 --> 02:00:17.378
Stark.

02:00:17.545 --> 02:00:18.629
You know me?

02:00:19.255 --> 02:00:20.381
I do.

02:00:20.923 --> 02:00:24.051
You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.

02:00:24.969 --> 02:00:26.304
My only curse is you.

02:00:28.890 --> 02:00:29.891
Come on!

02:00:57.835 --> 02:00:59.795
All that for a drop of blood.

02:01:43.839 --> 02:01:45.633
You have my respect, Stark.

02:01:47.301 --> 02:01:50.513
When I'm done, half of humanity
will still be alive.

02:01:56.018 --> 02:01:58.104
I hope they remember you.

02:02:07.905 --> 02:02:09.031
Stop.

02:02:15.329 --> 02:02:16.330
Spare his life...

02:02:18.124 --> 02:02:19.875
and I will give you the stone.

02:02:23.421 --> 02:02:24.714
No tricks.

02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:30.511
Don't.

02:03:21.937 --> 02:03:23.647
One to go.

02:03:33.532 --> 02:03:34.950
Where is he?

02:03:43.918 --> 02:03:45.294
Did we just lose?

02:03:49.215 --> 02:03:51.133
Why would you do that?

02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:56.722
We're in the endgame now.

02:04:21.539 --> 02:04:24.125
Are you okay?

02:04:26.085 --> 02:04:27.795
What? What is it?

02:04:29.964 --> 02:04:31.090
He's here.

02:04:42.101 --> 02:04:45.146
Everyone, on my position.
We have incoming.

02:04:47.898 --> 02:04:49.859
What the hell?

02:05:15.384 --> 02:05:16.385
Cap.

02:05:17.136 --> 02:05:18.596
That's him.

02:05:20.639 --> 02:05:23.225
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

02:05:47.708 --> 02:05:48.792
Wanda.

02:05:49.835 --> 02:05:51.128
It's time.

02:05:51.295 --> 02:05:52.296
No.

02:05:52.463 --> 02:05:54.673
They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can.

02:05:54.840 --> 02:05:56.258
Look at me.

02:05:56.425 --> 02:05:58.198
You have the power
to destroy the stone.

02:05:58.200 --> 02:05:58.760
Don't.

02:05:58.761 --> 02:06:00.261
You must do it. Wanda, please.

02:06:01.889 --> 02:06:04.475
We are out of time.

02:06:05.267 --> 02:06:06.393
I can't.

02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:07.978
Yes, you can.

02:06:08.646 --> 02:06:09.897
You can.

02:06:11.398 --> 02:06:13.692
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.

02:06:16.070 --> 02:06:17.571
It's not fair.

02:06:18.781 --> 02:06:20.366
It shouldn't be you, but it is.

02:06:22.326 --> 02:06:23.786
It's all right.

02:06:25.204 --> 02:06:26.914
You could never hurt me.

02:06:35.965 --> 02:06:37.758
I just feel you.

02:08:00.883 --> 02:08:02.009
It's all right.

02:08:11.935 --> 02:08:13.270
It's all right.

02:08:17.608 --> 02:08:18.692
I love you.

02:08:48.013 --> 02:08:50.140
I understand, my child.

02:08:51.683 --> 02:08:53.310
Better than anyone.

02:08:54.978 --> 02:08:56.897
You could never.

02:09:01.735 --> 02:09:04.738
Today, I lost more than you can know.

02:09:06.532 --> 02:09:09.159
But now is no time to mourn.

02:09:11.412 --> 02:09:15.416
Now is no time at all.

02:09:38.730 --> 02:09:39.731
No!

02:10:37.706 --> 02:10:39.166
I told you...

02:10:40.542 --> 02:10:42.377
you'd die for that.

02:10:56.725 --> 02:10:58.477
You should have...

02:11:01.104 --> 02:11:02.564
You should...

02:11:05.067 --> 02:11:08.320
You should have gone for the head.

02:11:10.239 --> 02:11:11.240
No!

02:11:44.648 --> 02:11:45.857
Daughter?

02:11:53.490 --> 02:11:54.866
Did you do it?

02:11:56.785 --> 02:11:57.786
Yes.

02:12:06.211 --> 02:12:07.796
What did it cost?

02:12:11.508 --> 02:12:13.010
Everything.

02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:24.813
What did you do?

02:12:26.064 --> 02:12:27.566
What'd you do?

02:12:41.204 --> 02:12:42.581
Where'd he go?

02:12:45.500 --> 02:12:46.585
Thor.

02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:51.506
Where'd he go?

02:12:51.673 --> 02:12:52.924
Steve?

02:13:27.751 --> 02:13:30.045
Up, General. Up!

02:13:30.629 --> 02:13:32.047
This is no place to die.

02:13:47.104 --> 02:13:48.689
I am Groot.

02:13:48.772 --> 02:13:50.315
Oh...

02:13:51.191 --> 02:13:53.276
No, no, no!

02:13:54.111 --> 02:13:56.947
Groot! No.

02:14:10.377 --> 02:14:11.545
Sam!

02:14:15.590 --> 02:14:17.342
Sam, where you at?

02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:28.770
Something's happening.

02:14:40.907 --> 02:14:42.075
Quill?

02:14:49.458 --> 02:14:50.500
Steady, Quill.

02:14:50.751 --> 02:14:51.918
Oh, man.

02:14:56.089 --> 02:14:57.090
Tony.

02:15:00.635 --> 02:15:03.096
There was no other way.

02:15:08.769 --> 02:15:09.770
Mr. Stark?

02:15:14.232 --> 02:15:15.567
I don't feel so good.

02:15:17.652 --> 02:15:18.653
You're all right.

02:15:18.737 --> 02:15:20.737
I don't... I don't know
what's happening.

02:15:20.897 --> 02:15:22.440
I don't know...

02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:24.284
I don't want to go.

02:15:24.367 --> 02:15:26.077
I don't want to go, sir.
Please.

02:15:26.244 --> 02:15:28.955
Please, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

02:15:33.502 --> 02:15:35.003
I'm sorry.

02:15:49.851 --> 02:15:51.311
He did it.

02:16:16.086 --> 02:16:19.297
What is this?
What the hell is happening?

02:16:36.189 --> 02:16:37.941
Oh, God.

02:27:34.222 --> 02:27:35.556
«Still no word from Stark?»

02:27:35.723 --> 02:27:36.974
«No, not yet.»

02:27:37.141 --> 02:27:38.641
«We're watching every satellite»

02:27:38.725 --> 02:27:40.625
«on both hemispheres, but still nothing.»

02:27:40.785 --> 02:27:42.438
What is it?

02:27:42.605 --> 02:27:44.941
Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.

02:27:45.107 --> 02:27:47.026
Same energy signature as New York?

02:27:47.193 --> 02:27:48.528
Ten times bigger.

02:27:50.029 --> 02:27:51.529
Tell Klein we'll meet him at...

02:27:51.689 --> 02:27:52.731
Nick! Nick!

02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:07.213
They okay?

02:28:08.214 --> 02:28:09.966
There's no one here.

02:28:19.517 --> 02:28:21.018
Call Control.

02:28:21.769 --> 02:28:23.062
Code red.

02:28:23.729 --> 02:28:24.730
Nick.

02:28:26.399 --> 02:28:27.400
Hill.

02:28:42.331 --> 02:28:43.499
Oh, no.

02:28:45.126 --> 02:28:46.127
Mother...
