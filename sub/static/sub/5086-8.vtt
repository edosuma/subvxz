[Family talking in background]

00:23.733 --> 00:26.267
Do we have any
plans for Saturday?

00:26.333 --> 00:28.400
Saturday. That's
hours and hours away.

00:28.467 --> 00:29.567
I don't know. Why?

00:29.633 --> 00:33.133
I'd like to go see my dad.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.600
Oh, it's his
birthday already. Wow.

00:35.667 --> 00:39.533
I haven't seen him
since he... left.

00:42.467 --> 00:45.267
It would be so great to
see him on his birthday.

00:45.333 --> 00:49.767
Yeah, it would. But there's this
whole process that you have

00:49.833 --> 00:52.933
to go through before a minor
can see a prisoner, and...

00:53.000 --> 00:56.100
...I just need to follow up
and see how that's going.

00:56.167 --> 00:57.767
Okay?

00:57.833 --> 01:00.267
Does that sound good to you?

01:04.133 --> 01:07.100
I know that it's hard on
the kids, not seeing me.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.067
But you think it's not
gonna be hard on them

01:09.100 --> 01:09.967
seeing me like this?

01:10.067 --> 01:12.467
They know
where you are, Tim.

01:12.533 --> 01:15.300
They know what you did.

01:15.367 --> 01:18.067
What they don't know is,
I've been lying to them,

01:18.100 --> 01:20.467
creating these fake hoops
that you're supposedly jumping

01:20.533 --> 01:22.700
through before
you can see them.

01:22.767 --> 01:24.400
You've never
lied for me before.

01:24.467 --> 01:27.433
Why're you doing it now?

01:28.967 --> 01:34.267
You're right,
I shouldn't.

01:34.333 --> 01:36.367
So you tell them yourself.

01:36.433 --> 01:39.167
Give them a call, and tell
them how much you miss them,

01:39.233 --> 01:43.633
and tell them not to come
see you on your birthday.

01:52.067 --> 01:52.967
Saturday.

01:53.067 --> 01:54.067
Thank you.

01:54.100 --> 01:56.800
We're done here.

02:11.633 --> 02:16.067
[Struggling]

02:18.600 --> 02:22.900
Hey!

02:28.100 --> 02:29.600
Hey buddy, are
you all right?

02:29.667 --> 02:33.333
Yes, I'm fine.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.933
What was all that about?

02:35.067 --> 02:36.767
I don't know, I need
to get back to work.

02:36.833 --> 02:41.733
My name's Matt McLean,
I run this project.

02:41.800 --> 02:44.600
John Chow.

02:44.667 --> 02:47.067
You work for the plumbing
subcontractor, yeah?

02:47.067 --> 02:49.433
Yes, Mr. Rigby.

02:49.500 --> 02:53.533
What's going on here, John?

02:53.600 --> 02:56.567
It's all a misunderstanding.
It's not your problem.

02:56.633 --> 02:59.867
This is my job site. Anything
that happens is my problem.

03:02.167 --> 03:06.100
My wife and her partner
will do anything to help you.

03:06.167 --> 03:09.467
Just explain to them
the way you did to me, okay?

03:09.533 --> 03:14.433
Allison and Devin are good
people, you can trust them.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.400
They won't let
Mei-Mei go.

03:16.467 --> 03:18.600
Mei-Mei is his girlfriend.

03:18.667 --> 03:22.733
I paid them to bring her here
from our hometown in China.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.300
Who are these people?

03:24.367 --> 03:25.567
He doesn't know
their names.

03:25.633 --> 03:27.867
They contact him,
never the other way around.

03:27.933 --> 03:29.933
So, you paid these men
to bring your girlfriend

03:30.067 --> 03:33.133
into the country illegally?

03:38.600 --> 03:41.167
I should not have come.
I am sorry to bother you.

03:41.233 --> 03:43.967
Are you in the country
illegally, Mr. Chow?

03:50.100 --> 03:52.900
My papers are
counterfeit, yes.

03:52.967 --> 03:55.867
That's why I had to pay
these men bring to her here.

03:55.933 --> 03:57.833
If my papers were real,
I would have gone home,

03:57.900 --> 04:01.567
married her, brought
her here myself but...

04:01.633 --> 04:03.067
I'm sorry.

04:03.067 --> 04:06.067
Are you sure they have
Mei-Mei here in Washington?

04:07.633 --> 04:10.467
They gave me this.

04:15.233 --> 04:17.133
Yesterday's paper.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.700
How much more do they want?

04:18.767 --> 04:23.067
Five thousand dollars.
Or they won't let her go.

04:24.833 --> 04:27.667
I'm afraid that if we don't
pay, they will hurt her.

04:27.733 --> 04:29.100
They only gave
me three days.

04:29.167 --> 04:30.567
Let's not worry about
the money right now.

04:30.633 --> 04:32.400
Let's focus on
finding Mei-Mei.

04:32.467 --> 04:34.333
How do you communicate
with these men?

04:34.400 --> 04:37.067
I talked to them once, when
they first approached me.

04:37.133 --> 04:39.567
Everything else is
from text message.

04:39.633 --> 04:41.767
We're going to need to
look at your phone.

04:41.833 --> 04:43.700
They approached you?

04:43.767 --> 04:47.400
Yes, outside my church.

04:47.467 --> 04:49.333
How did they know
you have a girlfriend

04:49.400 --> 04:51.833
who wants to come
into the country?

04:51.900 --> 04:54.333
I told everybody I want
to bring Mei-Mei over.

04:54.400 --> 04:58.900
My friends, my classmates
in my English class at the

04:58.967 --> 05:01.900
community center, people
at the bar after work.

05:01.967 --> 05:03.933
I light candles at
church every day,

05:04.067 --> 05:05.467
I tell people
there too.

05:05.533 --> 05:07.067
Okay, plenty of
possibilities.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.833
I'm going to need you both to
sit down with a sketch artist.

05:09.900 --> 05:11.733
Then we'll start with
the church and see

05:11.800 --> 05:13.533
if they know the two men.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.867
We're going to do everything
we can to find Mei-Mei.

05:15.933 --> 05:18.133
Okay, Mr. Chow?
Everything.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.900
Did you check the SIM
card on John Chow's phone?

05:34.967 --> 05:39.300
No, I'm not telling you
how to do your job--

05:39.367 --> 05:41.067
The phone numbers,
any of the traces

05:41.067 --> 05:43.767
come up on the
phone numbers?

05:43.833 --> 05:49.967
Okay, thank you, Kayla.

05:50.067 --> 05:53.433
So, the world's happiest
forensic tech says all the texts

05:53.500 --> 05:57.833
John received were from burner
phones. So, no leads there.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.900
I talked to the priest
and the church secretary.

06:00.067 --> 06:02.067
Neither of them has heard
any talk about smugglers.

06:02.067 --> 06:03.100
And the sketch?

06:03.167 --> 06:05.667
Didn't ring a bell.
How about you?

06:05.733 --> 06:08.067
Any interesting
people-watching?

06:08.100 --> 06:11.067
Well, Mr. Congeniality over
there keeps talking to

06:11.067 --> 06:14.333
single people as they come out,
but no couples or families.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.100
He doesn't match
the sketch.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.633
Maybe his job is to
find the lonely hearts.

06:18.700 --> 06:22.967
And then he funnels them
through John's smugglers.

06:23.067 --> 06:24.633
Shall we?

06:24.700 --> 06:27.633
Yes, let's.

06:35.967 --> 06:40.067
Stop!
Police!

06:51.067 --> 06:52.467
[Man Yelling]

06:52.533 --> 06:55.833
[Water Splashing]

07:03.067 --> 07:04.800
I hope Mr. Lonelyhearts
serves his

07:04.867 --> 07:06.967
customers as quickly
as he runs.

07:23.167 --> 07:25.733
Hey! I didn't do
anything wrong!

07:25.800 --> 07:27.933
You run from the
police for exercise?

07:28.067 --> 07:29.600
We're looking for two Asian
men who are smuggling

07:29.667 --> 07:31.067
people into the country.

07:31.100 --> 07:33.100
So this is racial profiling!

07:33.167 --> 07:34.900
This has the possibility of
being a polite conversation

07:34.967 --> 07:37.067
for about ten more
seconds. And then

07:37.133 --> 07:38.567
it's an interrogation
at the station.

07:38.633 --> 07:41.067
I help newly arrived members
of the community find jobs.

07:41.133 --> 07:42.467
That makes me one
of the good guys.

07:42.533 --> 07:45.233
Yeah? Let's see if
you know the bad guys.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.067
Yeah!
You know them.

07:52.100 --> 07:53.067
I didn't say that.

07:53.133 --> 07:55.067
A woman's life
is at stake.

07:55.067 --> 07:57.667
I might have seen them
around. I'm not sure.

07:57.733 --> 07:59.833
Sometimes the smart thing
to do is to focus on my own

07:59.900 --> 08:02.433
business and stay
out of other people's.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.300
How exactly does
your business work?

08:05.367 --> 08:06.867
I'm a matchmaker.

08:06.933 --> 08:08.700
I know employer's needs,
and I find people

08:08.767 --> 08:10.267
who can fill those needs.

08:10.333 --> 08:12.900
So if you met a young woman
who recently arrived in this

08:12.967 --> 08:14.867
country; maybe her status is
somewhat questionable,

08:14.933 --> 08:17.833
what kind of job
could you find for her?

08:17.900 --> 08:19.633
I think much better
with my hands are free.

08:19.700 --> 08:20.533
We're not bargaining.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.833
I am, by talking to you.

08:23.900 --> 08:27.767
You don't understand
who these guys are.

08:36.333 --> 08:38.533
Thinking better?

08:38.600 --> 08:40.867
Much more clearly.

08:40.933 --> 08:42.433
What kind of
jobs do you match?

08:42.500 --> 08:44.167
The ones you don't notice.

08:44.233 --> 08:47.367
Farm work, Menial labor,
Cleaning, restaurants.

08:47.433 --> 08:49.200
Have you matched any
young women who have

08:49.267 --> 08:52.067
arrived in the country in
the last week? Maybe two?

08:52.100 --> 08:53.067
Possibly.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.400
Take us to them.

08:55.467 --> 09:00.567
I think it's much safer for all
of us if I send them to you.

09:02.967 --> 09:05.467
Alright keep this in mind:
we don't take well

09:05.533 --> 09:07.967
to being double-crossed.

09:09.933 --> 09:11.833
Oh my gosh,
oh my gosh!

09:11.900 --> 09:13.333
Is everything all right?

09:13.400 --> 09:15.133
My phone died at school,
I was charging it,

09:15.200 --> 09:17.200
and there's a voicemail
from your mom!

09:17.267 --> 09:20.833
We get to go see
Dad on Saturday!

09:21.067 --> 09:22.367
That's great.

09:22.433 --> 09:24.467
I have to plan! I don't
know where to start!

09:24.533 --> 09:27.100
Well, you want to get him cards
right? So, we can get Dad

09:27.167 --> 09:29.467
to stop at the store on the way
home from school tomorrow.

09:29.533 --> 09:35.233
Yes. A card. Oh, and a haircut!
And a new dress! Thank you!

09:37.600 --> 09:40.167
How about you?

09:43.267 --> 09:46.433
I'll skip the new dress.

09:53.067 --> 09:54.867
Hi, I'm Detective McLean.

09:54.933 --> 09:56.267
Hi, I'm Lihwa.

09:56.333 --> 09:58.533
Come this way. Renshu
spoke to you about

09:58.600 --> 10:01.067
why we wanted to talk to
you? About your trip over?

10:01.133 --> 10:03.733
I come to tell
you about Mei-Mei.

10:03.800 --> 10:04.933
You know her?

10:05.000 --> 10:09.200
I come three days
ago. On ship,Mei-Mei, too.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.933
Right this way.

10:16.367 --> 10:18.900
Did you check out
Kimmie's run on YouTube?

10:18.967 --> 10:22.333
Dude, you gotta check it out!

10:22.400 --> 10:26.567
Alright, then, it's on.
Saturday afternoon, bye.

10:26.633 --> 10:28.967
He is never gonna get a date.

10:29.033 --> 10:30.167
I thought you and Mariah

10:30.233 --> 10:32.200
were going to see your dad
Saturday afternoon.

10:32.267 --> 10:35.100
Since when did you
become a human wiretap?

10:35.167 --> 10:37.433
Don't you want
to see your dad?

10:37.500 --> 10:40.467
If you understood anything
about me or my life,

10:40.533 --> 10:46.067
you could ask questions.
But you don't. Step off.

10:46.133 --> 10:50.733
Wow. I cannot believe I got
in a fight to defend you.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.333
Quit waiting for
me to be grateful.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.867
I didn't ask
you to do that.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.067
You and Mei-Mei came
over on the same ship.

11:01.067 --> 11:03.067
After you got here,
where did they take you?

11:03.133 --> 11:07.933
A room. Cold.
Very dark. Down.

11:08.067 --> 11:11.733
Down?
Like a basement?

11:11.800 --> 11:14.833
Did you see their faces?
The people who brought you.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.233
They wear...

11:16.300 --> 11:17.233
Masks?

11:17.300 --> 11:19.167
Yes.
Hide face.

11:19.233 --> 11:21.800
Who paid for you
to come here?

11:27.100 --> 11:33.500
My brother bring me.
He is good, good man.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.800
The people, did they ask
your brother for more money,

11:35.867 --> 11:37.167
to let you go?

11:37.233 --> 11:39.933
Yes! More money. My brother
pay to men in mask.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.467
How did your
brother contact them?

11:41.533 --> 11:46.400
They go to him. They come again.
My brother says, like smoke.

11:46.467 --> 11:48.933
So he never had a name?
Or a phone number?

11:49.067 --> 11:50.933
No. Mei-Mei say
her boyfriend uh...

11:51.067 --> 11:51.567
John?

11:51.633 --> 11:52.733
John, yes.

11:52.800 --> 11:58.067
He not have money like
my brother. Very bad.

11:58.067 --> 12:03.267
Why? What happens
if he doesn't pay?

12:03.333 --> 12:08.133
Truck come Saturday.
Take her.

12:08.200 --> 12:11.433
Where?

12:11.500 --> 12:15.100
"PAI?"

12:15.167 --> 12:16.300
They'll never
see Mei-Mei again.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.500
They'll never
see Mei-Mei again.

12:21.733 --> 12:24.133
So if we don't find her by
Saturday, Mei-Mei is lost.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.533
We need to narrow
our list of suspects.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.733
We know the smugglers have good
access to the community...

12:28.800 --> 12:31.433
And know how to reel them in.
Then, if your family can't pay

12:31.500 --> 12:33.500
the extra money, you're
on the Saturday truck

12:33.567 --> 12:35.133
to indentured
servitude, or worse.

12:35.200 --> 12:38.800
So let's focus on community
access. We tried the church.

12:38.867 --> 12:43.600
John said he talked to friends,
the people in his class at the--

12:46.333 --> 12:50.100
Yeah. I'll drive.

12:53.200 --> 12:56.467
I love teaching English. This
class changed my life when

12:56.533 --> 13:00.067
I got here. Now I can share what
I've learned with others

13:00.067 --> 13:02.667
who are newly arrived.

13:02.733 --> 13:05.833
You're not a native speaker?
Your English is beautiful.

13:05.900 --> 13:11.867
Thank you. So, you are not here
for classes. How can I help you?

13:11.933 --> 13:13.833
We're working on a case
involving a student of yours,

13:13.900 --> 13:15.433
John Chow?

13:15.500 --> 13:19.100
John! Such a great
student. So dedicated.

13:19.167 --> 13:20.800
Wait. Is he in trouble?

13:20.867 --> 13:25.167
No. We're actually looking for
someone John may have talked to.

13:25.233 --> 13:28.533
This is a community center.
Everyone talks with everyone.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.833
I don't understand
what you need.

13:30.900 --> 13:31.500
Ms. Ma --

13:31.567 --> 13:34.700
Ying, please.

13:34.767 --> 13:37.667
I'm know this is a delicate
matter, but you are aware

13:37.733 --> 13:39.433
of people who come
to this center

13:39.500 --> 13:43.667
who entered the
country illegally?

13:43.733 --> 13:45.667
I hope you understand,
Detective,

13:45.733 --> 13:48.733
I don't concern myself with
how my students get here.

13:48.800 --> 13:52.467
I just welcome them and
try to help them fit in.

13:52.533 --> 13:54.367
That's why I
became a teacher,

13:54.433 --> 13:58.733
and joined the board here at the
center. This is my life's work.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.567
And I wouldn't want
you to compromise that.

14:01.633 --> 14:05.567
But I need you to be honest
with us. Do you have any reason

14:05.633 --> 14:08.900
to believe an employee, or
even one of your students,

14:08.967 --> 14:14.333
could be recruiting for
a smuggling operation?

14:14.400 --> 14:20.333
Smugglers?

14:20.400 --> 14:23.400
The next class is
about to start.

14:25.967 --> 14:28.633
We don't mean to put you
in a difficult position,

14:28.700 --> 14:30.833
but we do need your help.

14:30.900 --> 14:33.400
If you ask people here at the
center why they came to this

14:33.467 --> 14:38.067
country, some will
tell you for opportunity.

14:38.067 --> 14:42.667
Some will say sanctuary.
A few might even say love.

14:42.733 --> 14:45.800
But the real reason,
what all that's part of,

14:45.867 --> 14:48.433
is a new beginning.

14:48.500 --> 14:52.967
So I don't want to judge
anyone because of their past.

14:53.067 --> 14:56.233
But.

14:58.333 --> 15:01.367
I also want to protect
the people who come here,

15:01.433 --> 15:04.167
from anyone who would
take advantage of them.

15:04.233 --> 15:07.367
So there is someone with a
past you're concerned about?

15:09.700 --> 15:13.600
A former student of
mine, a man named Shan.

15:13.667 --> 15:17.833
He confessed he had a
criminal record in China.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.333
He was in John's class.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.333
Do you know where
we can find him?

15:22.400 --> 15:26.067
He works as a handyman.
At the Orthodox church.

15:35.600 --> 15:36.767
Hey...

15:36.833 --> 15:38.767
Didn't hear the knock.
Manners much?

15:38.833 --> 15:40.867
Where's that big sister
radar that always busts me

15:40.933 --> 15:42.267
when I'm trying to
steal cookies?

15:42.333 --> 15:44.167
What do you want Jeff?

15:44.233 --> 15:45.833
There's this thing
with Cameron.

15:45.900 --> 15:48.200
Oh! Let me drop
everything.

15:48.267 --> 15:50.333
He's going to ditch the
birthday trip to see his dad.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.700
Did he tell you that?

15:51.767 --> 15:57.300
Yes. So, do I tell Mom
and let Cameron hate me,

15:57.367 --> 15:59.767
or let it play out and
have Mom get mad when

15:59.833 --> 16:02.067
she figures out I knew?

16:02.100 --> 16:04.400
If we tell Mom, both
Mom and Cameron blow up.

16:04.467 --> 16:06.267
If there's some way for
us to talk to Cameron,

16:06.333 --> 16:08.933
then, at most, he freaks.
And who'll notice, really?

16:09.067 --> 16:11.633
The way I do the math,
we talk to Cameron.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.900
So you want me to
come with you now?

16:13.967 --> 16:18.933
No, it's fine. I'll do it. Your
hair looks good like that.

16:23.567 --> 16:26.200
[Sawing]

16:31.367 --> 16:32.433
Are you Shan?

16:32.500 --> 16:34.800
Yeah, I'm Shan.

16:34.867 --> 16:35.500
We're--

16:35.567 --> 16:38.633
Cops. Obviously.

16:38.700 --> 16:41.833
We just have a few
questions for you.

16:41.900 --> 16:47.567
Know why I left China?
Police harassment.

16:47.633 --> 16:52.600
Trust me, this isn't harassment.
We're looking for cooperation

16:52.667 --> 16:55.800
okay? So, let's have a friendly
conversation about a young

16:55.867 --> 16:59.100
woman called Mei-Mei. And the
two men who are holding her.

16:59.167 --> 17:01.533
And possibly
other women.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.867
Holding them?

17:02.933 --> 17:05.100
These two men are running
an extortion game.

17:05.167 --> 17:09.667
In league with smugglers.
Know anybody like that?

17:09.733 --> 17:11.333
You know Mei-Mei's
boyfriend, John Chow,

17:11.400 --> 17:14.700
from your English class. Did you
tell the smugglers he wanted to

17:14.767 --> 17:16.300
bring his girlfriend over?

17:16.367 --> 17:18.600
Or did you broker
the deal yourself?

17:18.667 --> 17:20.833
You don't understand
what you're dealing with.

17:20.900 --> 17:21.900
Tell us.

17:21.967 --> 17:23.633
If you want these
women to get hurt,

17:23.700 --> 17:24.733
just keep pushing.

17:24.800 --> 17:28.567
If something bad
happens, it's on you.

17:28.633 --> 17:32.067
Is that a warning
or a threat?

17:32.100 --> 17:35.233
Arrest me or let me work.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.800
I really appreciate what
you're doing for John.

17:57.867 --> 17:59.300
I wish I was
doing more.

17:59.367 --> 18:03.300
The clock is ticking, and
still haven't found Mei-Mei.

18:03.367 --> 18:05.967
I've been thinking
about something.

18:06.067 --> 18:07.600
I need you to hear me out.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.133
Okay.

18:10.433 --> 18:12.167
I know that things
are tight with us now,

18:12.233 --> 18:13.600
especially with
Cameron and Mariah,

18:13.667 --> 18:18.567
but we got a lot more
than most people, right?

18:18.633 --> 18:23.433
Even if it means dipping into
our savings, I feel like

18:23.500 --> 18:28.900
if it comes down to it, I'd like
to help John pay these guys.

18:31.367 --> 18:36.067
I love you for wanting to
do that, but we can't.

18:36.100 --> 18:37.733
He doesn't have anybody...

18:37.800 --> 18:41.600
Yeah but we can't
pay kidnappers.

18:48.967 --> 18:50.367
How's John doing?

18:50.433 --> 18:53.400
He's a wreck. But he insisted
on coming back to the site.

18:53.467 --> 18:55.567
He's working twice as hard.

18:55.633 --> 18:58.700
Sometimes work
makes things better.

19:00.067 --> 19:03.233
What happens to him
when this part is done?

19:03.300 --> 19:10.367
I'm not sure. He's a victim,
but he also broke the law.

19:10.433 --> 19:14.633
If we were separated like that,
I'd do anything to get you back.

19:23.933 --> 19:26.967
I'm always the first one
to come in, in the morning,

19:27.067 --> 19:31.933
to answer the voicemail.
This is how I found it.

19:32.067 --> 19:35.133
Can you translate
it for us?

19:35.200 --> 19:39.567
The first symbols
mean, do not.

19:39.633 --> 19:44.233
The second ones mean,
police talk.

19:46.333 --> 19:49.467
Don't talk to the police.

19:52.800 --> 19:56.067
I got your --

19:58.533 --> 20:02.500
Oh no.
Who did this?

20:02.567 --> 20:04.400
I have no idea.

20:04.467 --> 20:06.900
Our forensic
team is on the way.

20:06.967 --> 20:13.233
Why would -- Who did
you talk to? Shan?

20:13.300 --> 20:15.200
Ying, we need to follow
every possible lead --

20:15.267 --> 20:19.567
That's what I was afraid of.
Now it comes back on me.

20:19.633 --> 20:21.667
My students.

20:21.733 --> 20:24.200
We're doing everything to
find the men who did this

20:24.267 --> 20:27.000
and remove them
from the community.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.900
Most of them came to
this country to feel safe.

20:33.967 --> 20:38.000
They need to be able to
come here and feel safe.

20:38.067 --> 20:43.567
To trust me. I can't
talk to you anymore.

20:56.267 --> 20:58.933
Breakfast in five, girls!

21:03.800 --> 21:07.567
What do you think?

21:07.633 --> 21:10.167
Depends.
What's the occasion?

21:10.233 --> 21:13.467
You going to see your Dad. Which
one would you like to borrow?

21:13.533 --> 21:16.100
I thought the blue one would
look super cute on you,

21:16.167 --> 21:18.800
but I have others.

21:20.933 --> 21:23.867
I don't know
what I want to wear,

21:23.933 --> 21:26.467
I don't know what
the card should say,

21:26.533 --> 21:32.367
I don't know what
to do with my hair,

21:32.433 --> 21:37.067
I don't know what to say to
him when I see him other than

21:37.067 --> 21:39.067
Happy Birthday, which
is so stupid because

21:39.800 --> 21:42.567
how happy can he be?

21:42.633 --> 21:45.133
I'm going to mess this whole
thing up, I know I am.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.433
No, you won't.
Okay?

21:47.500 --> 21:50.500
He's probably just as
nervous as you are.

21:50.567 --> 21:53.167
Parents, they don't like us
to know when they're nervous

21:53.233 --> 21:57.167
or scared or upset. They
think they're protecting us.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.567
So I bet he'll be just as
worried as you are about

21:59.633 --> 22:02.400
saying the right thing,
he just won't show it.

22:02.467 --> 22:04.267
I don't want to make
things worse for him.

22:04.333 --> 22:08.467
You won't. He'll feel
better just seeing you.

22:08.533 --> 22:11.833
But I still have
to say something.

22:11.900 --> 22:14.567
Tell him... tell him
funny stories about

22:14.633 --> 22:18.067
Cameron and Jeff
doing stupid things.

22:18.100 --> 22:22.333
That'll take care of the
first hour or two, at least.

22:27.767 --> 22:31.133
Do you have
anything in orange?

22:33.133 --> 22:35.500
So was the graffiti a message
from Shan? Or did Shan

22:35.567 --> 22:37.800
pass along that we were asking
questions to someone else?

22:37.867 --> 22:39.867
Either way, he's involved.
So we need dig hard,

22:39.933 --> 22:41.800
and get enough
to bring him in.

22:41.867 --> 22:44.067
Phone buzzin ]

22:44.067 --> 22:46.933
I'll be right back.

22:47.133 --> 22:53.267
You have a call from
reenwater Corrections Center.G

22:53.333 --> 22:54.067
Tim?

22:54.067 --> 22:55.533
es.Y

22:55.600 --> 22:57.233
What's up?

22:57.300 --> 22:59.100
Saturday.

22:59.167 --> 23:01.333
No. You are not
backing out, Tim.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.667
Don't come.

23:02.733 --> 23:04.400
Unbelievable.
Grow up!

23:04.467 --> 23:05.667
Excuse me?

23:05.733 --> 23:06.833
You're doing time because
you had to prove

23:06.900 --> 23:08.333
what a big tough
guy you are.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.600
Now you can't even step up to
the plate for an hour,--

23:10.667 --> 23:12.867
one hour -- to make
your children happy?

23:12.933 --> 23:16.100
I don't need a lecture from you
about being a better father,

23:16.167 --> 23:18.733
about being a better man,
about being a better anything.

23:18.800 --> 23:22.167
What I need is for you to
stop pretending I can be

23:22.233 --> 23:24.433
anything other
than this right now.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.800
Too bad.

23:26.867 --> 23:33.067
You said you took my kids in to
protect them. So protect them.

23:46.067 --> 23:47.833
Listen, before our
carpool gets here,

23:47.900 --> 23:51.267
I have something I
want to say.

23:55.767 --> 24:00.233
Fine! Pretend I'm just
a voice in your head.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.733
The one that tells you if
you're about to screw up.

24:02.800 --> 24:06.100
Because that's
what you're doing.

24:09.867 --> 24:11.833
If you blow off this
trip, your dad will be hurt.

24:11.900 --> 24:16.833
Mariah will cry and
my mom will flip out.

24:16.900 --> 24:19.967
Go back to being a
jerk Saturday night,

24:20.067 --> 24:23.233
but do the right
thing Saturday afternoon.

24:23.300 --> 24:25.767
It's always nice to
talk to you, cuz.

24:45.233 --> 24:47.800
How you doing?
What happened?

24:50.300 --> 24:52.900
That says, 4 PM.

24:52.967 --> 24:55.767
I thought
we had until Saturday.

24:55.833 --> 24:58.133
You're telling me the deadline
is in less than three hours?

24:58.200 --> 25:03.667
They want all the money by
today. I don't have it.

25:03.733 --> 25:05.500
They've already hurt her.
What will they do if

25:05.567 --> 25:06.867
I don't get them the money?

25:06.933 --> 25:08.933
It's not going to come
to that, I promise you.

25:09.067 --> 25:11.733
My wife and her partner
will make sure of that.

25:13.367 --> 25:15.733
Okay, how about the gas station
on the corner? Their cameras

25:15.800 --> 25:17.500
should have a line of sight to
the community center...

25:17.567 --> 25:21.733
Shan's record is
completely clean? No...

25:21.800 --> 25:23.733
Okay great, keep
working on it.

25:23.800 --> 25:27.200
You're Sure? I'll call
you right back.

25:28.667 --> 25:30.300
Allison...

25:30.367 --> 25:31.833
Thanks.

25:31.900 --> 25:32.600
Hi!

25:32.667 --> 25:35.300
Look at this.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.500
Where'd this come from?

25:36.567 --> 25:38.267
It was at the job
site this morning.

25:38.333 --> 25:39.833
The new deadline
is four o'clock.

25:39.900 --> 25:40.867
Less than two hours.

25:40.933 --> 25:43.100
Yeah.

25:43.167 --> 25:45.933
Why do you have
a photo of Shan?

25:46.067 --> 25:47.333
You remember him?

25:47.400 --> 25:49.933
Yes, he was in
my English class.

25:50.067 --> 25:53.067
You don't think he is involved
with the men who have Mei-Mei?

25:53.100 --> 25:54.633
We're considering
that possibility.

25:54.700 --> 25:56.933
No, no.

25:57.067 --> 26:01.200
Shan looks rough, I know.
But he has a good heart.

26:01.267 --> 26:03.233
He wasn't very helpful
when we spoke to him.

26:03.300 --> 26:07.200
Of course not, you're
strangers. Police.

26:07.267 --> 26:08.767
He is much
different as a friend.

26:08.833 --> 26:11.067
We've had many long
talks in class.

26:11.067 --> 26:14.867
He too wants to bring his wife
over. You must forget about Shan

26:14.933 --> 26:16.733
and focus on the men
who have Mei-Mei.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.200
Wait John, stop.

26:18.267 --> 26:20.667
You talked about your wives
and girlfriends during class?

26:20.733 --> 26:25.300
Yes. Ying encouraged us to talk
about our lives back home,

26:25.367 --> 26:28.733
and our families, I know many
facts about my classmates now.

26:28.800 --> 26:32.733
I'm sure you do.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.400
We'll just, uh...
wait here.

26:46.667 --> 26:49.600
This is the
place? 4959?

26:49.667 --> 26:53.100
Yeah, this is the address
the receptionist gave me.

26:53.167 --> 26:54.867
She said she left the
community center right after

26:54.933 --> 26:56.333
we did and headed home.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.467
Not quite what I
was expecting.

26:58.533 --> 27:00.067
Well she's full
of surprises.

27:00.100 --> 27:03.167
Let's turn the tables.

27:06.267 --> 27:07.867
[Knocking]

27:07.933 --> 27:11.967
Crestview PD.
Ying Ma, open up!

27:16.933 --> 27:18.600
Hey Devin?

27:18.667 --> 27:20.967
Nothing.

27:21.067 --> 27:25.100
Crestview PD!

27:29.100 --> 27:30.433
Help! Help me please!

27:30.500 --> 27:31.200
Did you hear that?

27:31.267 --> 27:34.400
Yeah.

27:40.233 --> 27:41.567
Help me! Help

27:41.633 --> 27:45.300
Did you hear that?
That's probable cause.

27:50.533 --> 27:53.533
[Glass breaking]

27:56.433 --> 27:58.467
Help me, please!

28:06.067 --> 28:09.433
Crestview PD.
We're here to help you.

28:15.233 --> 28:17.100
Do you understand?

28:17.167 --> 28:20.433
We're police officers,
we're here to help you.

28:20.500 --> 28:24.533
Are you hurt?
Are you okay?

28:27.233 --> 28:32.867
I'm going to show
you a picture...

28:32.933 --> 28:34.600
Mask men take her.

28:34.667 --> 28:36.900
They took her just now?

28:36.967 --> 28:40.900
Mei-Mei...

28:40.967 --> 28:43.767
Yeah, I need an
ambulance, 4959 Addison...

28:51.067 --> 28:53.533
The woman who was placed
in the truck, Mei-Mei.

28:53.600 --> 28:54.867
Do you know what'll
happen to her?

28:54.933 --> 28:55.967
Sold.

28:56.067 --> 28:59.333
Do you have any
idea where they went?

28:59.400 --> 29:02.667
Did you remember them
saying anything else?

29:04.133 --> 29:07.267
We really want
to find Mei-Mei.

29:09.833 --> 29:15.467
Ying say, go to
lawn of salvation.

29:20.100 --> 29:23.433
Okay. Thank you.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.867
They're gonna
take care of you, okay?

29:43.200 --> 29:44.567
Where's Chow?

29:44.633 --> 29:46.967
He had a personal matter to
attend to, I gave him the day.

29:47.067 --> 29:49.067
Then why was he on
site half an hour ago,

29:49.067 --> 29:50.733
asking me how to get
to Snoqualmie Pass?

29:50.800 --> 29:52.367
He was here?
I didn't see him.

29:52.433 --> 29:54.400
That's because he was sneaking
around, breaking into my truck

29:54.467 --> 29:56.900
and stealing my payroll
cash for the day laborers.

29:56.967 --> 29:58.467
C'mon Rigby, John
wouldn't do that.

29:58.533 --> 30:00.500
He cleaned me out!

30:14.700 --> 30:16.100
Hey.
Everything okay?

30:16.167 --> 30:18.933
No. John Chow just stole money
to pay to those smugglers.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.600
What?
From you?

30:20.667 --> 30:22.400
No, from Rigby.

30:22.467 --> 30:25.533
He was asking for
directions to Snoqualmie Pass.

30:25.600 --> 30:29.600
Okay. Hey can you bring up
Snoqualmie Pass on the screen.

30:29.667 --> 30:31.900
Matt, you're on speaker.

30:31.967 --> 30:33.267
I should've kept
an eye on him.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.267
Honey, it's not your fault.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.767
We talked to a woman
who said Ying was taking

30:37.833 --> 30:40.700
Mei-Mei to the
lawn of salvation.

30:40.767 --> 30:44.167
John's never mentioned
the pass to me before...

30:44.233 --> 30:46.567
It doesn't make sense for the
smugglers to use the lodges up

30:46.633 --> 30:49.200
there as an exchange
point. It's too visible.

30:49.267 --> 30:52.667
Maybe the meeting's not at the
pass. They're just heading

30:52.733 --> 30:54.733
in that direction and using
it as a reference point.

30:54.800 --> 30:57.300
But they still have to pick a
spot that's fairly isolated.

30:57.367 --> 30:59.667
Any cemeteries up there?

30:59.733 --> 31:03.400
No, but there is
a salvage yard.

31:03.467 --> 31:04.933
Lawn of salvation.

31:05.067 --> 31:08.600
Salvage, salvation. It's
all in the translation.

31:08.667 --> 31:12.267
And the city closed this yard a
year ago. There's the isolation.

31:12.333 --> 31:15.367
Thanks, babe. I'll let you
know when we find John.

31:15.433 --> 31:17.700
Yeah, be careful.
Love you.

31:17.767 --> 31:19.867
Love you, too.

31:19.933 --> 31:22.367
John's been told to meet there
to pay Ying and her people,

31:22.433 --> 31:24.733
and release Mei-Mei
in the next 35 minutes.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.333
Ying accelerated the
schedule and ran. She knows

31:27.400 --> 31:29.867
we're after her and that
makes John a loose end.

31:29.933 --> 31:32.700
She wants John there
so she can kill him.

31:32.767 --> 31:34.800
Let's roll.

31:55.200 --> 31:58.433
You? I can't
believe you--

31:58.500 --> 32:03.100
It's just business, John.
Did you bring the money?

32:03.167 --> 32:04.933
Most of it.

32:05.067 --> 32:06.733
Almost two
thousand dollars.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.633
John! John!

32:08.700 --> 32:15.733
Mei-Mei, it's okay, I'm here!
It's okay, Mei-Mei!

32:15.800 --> 32:19.133
The price is five
thousand, John. Not two.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.133
Please, this is all I
could get. Don't take her.

32:22.200 --> 32:27.133
I'll do anything.
Take me. Sell me.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.300
Do whatever you
want with me.

32:33.533 --> 32:34.300
Okay.

32:34.367 --> 32:35.333
Okay.

32:37.900 --> 32:40.767
Take his money
and shoot him.

32:42.333 --> 32:44.433
Please, I'll get you
the rest of the money!

32:44.500 --> 32:47.600
You talked to the police,
John. Bad for business.

32:47.667 --> 32:51.167
We just want to be
together, I love her.

32:51.867 --> 32:55.367
Shoot him and dump
his body in the woods.

32:55.433 --> 32:59.100

Stop them!

[Grimacing in pain]

34:01.833 --> 34:06.567
Put your weapon
down! Now!

34:06.633 --> 34:09.267
Ying! Stop!

34:09.333 --> 34:11.567
I've got him.
Go!

34:11.633 --> 34:14.400
Put your hands on your
head and turn around!

34:24.100 --> 34:27.633
You had me fooled, Ying!

34:27.700 --> 34:30.500
I thought you actually
liked to help these people.

34:30.567 --> 34:35.267
Help them find new
lives, new hope.

34:35.333 --> 34:38.633
But all you care
about is the money.

34:38.700 --> 34:44.933
That is the American dream!
I have money. Power.

34:45.067 --> 34:47.733
These women want the same!

34:47.800 --> 34:49.067
And you're gonna
help them get that

34:49.133 --> 34:51.433
by selling them
into slavery?

34:51.500 --> 34:53.267
I'm giving them
an opportunity.

34:53.333 --> 34:56.633
It's up to them to
make something of it.

[Gun firing]

35:07.667 --> 35:12.233

35:12.300 --> 35:16.267
I should arrest you for
crimes against feminism.

35:24.967 --> 35:27.167
John and Mei-Mei
are both safe.

35:27.233 --> 35:30.067
Thank you for everything you
did for him. For them.

35:30.133 --> 35:31.800
Thank you, sweetheart.
You're terrific.

35:31.867 --> 35:38.533
Well, you made this happen.
I'll be home soon.

35:38.600 --> 35:44.233
Matt sends his best. He's
so happy you're both safe.

35:44.300 --> 35:47.200
I'm sorry for
stealing the money.

35:47.267 --> 35:50.800
I know it was wrong, but
when I saw the photo of her,

35:50.867 --> 35:54.800
how they'd hurt her --

35:54.867 --> 36:00.200
Matt will talk to Rigby.
He'll see what he can do.

36:01.633 --> 36:03.700
Did you tell them
about our papers?

36:03.767 --> 36:06.833
Do me and Mei-Mei need
to go with them now?

36:08.133 --> 36:11.600
John, You were just trying to
bring your family together and

36:11.667 --> 36:16.100
I know from personal experience
how tough that can be.

36:16.167 --> 36:18.633
We're going to need you
as witnesses against Ying.

36:18.700 --> 36:20.533
I don't understand.

36:20.600 --> 36:23.067
Matt and I know a
great immigration lawyer.

36:23.133 --> 36:25.800
We'll have him meet
with you and Mei-Mei.

36:25.867 --> 36:28.067
I'm sure the Feds
will be gracious,

36:28.067 --> 36:32.333
since we couldn't have
caught Ying without you.

36:32.400 --> 36:42.400
(Speaking in Mandarin)

36:42.467 --> 36:47.367
She says you are now
a part of our family.

36:47.433 --> 36:49.300
And we will do
everything we can

36:49.367 --> 36:56.433
to help you get
started in Crestview.

36:56.500 --> 37:02.467
(Speaking in Mandarin)

37:09.400 --> 37:11.400
Thank you.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.567
[Gaming sounds]

37:21.833 --> 37:24.567
Who made you dress
up on a Saturday?

37:24.633 --> 37:28.333
I'm gonna go see my dad.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.600
You look almost
as nice as Mariah.

37:30.667 --> 37:33.767
Do you have your
birthday cards?

37:33.833 --> 37:35.567
Does my hair look okay?

37:35.633 --> 37:38.700
It looks nice.

37:38.767 --> 37:40.067
I'm nervous.

37:40.100 --> 37:42.667
Don't be. It'll be
great. You'll be great.

37:42.733 --> 37:47.533
Yes. This is going
to be wonderful.

37:47.600 --> 37:48.367
Have fun.

37:48.433 --> 37:49.300
Thank you.

37:49.367 --> 37:51.167
Take it easy.

37:51.233 --> 37:53.467
I'll try.

38:07.067 --> 38:09.833
Good afternoon. Here to
see Timothy Olson.

38:14.700 --> 38:16.100
Why don't you
guys sit down?

38:16.167 --> 38:17.367
What's wrong?

38:17.433 --> 38:20.133
Nothing, I just need
to get us signed in.

38:22.867 --> 38:26.867
This is a scheduled visit.

38:26.933 --> 38:29.133
Yeah, um... it looks like your
inmate's in the infirmary.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.567
No one's allowed
to see him.

38:31.633 --> 38:33.267
Can you take me in?

38:33.333 --> 38:38.533
I can give you an exception for
the badge, but not for them.

38:43.833 --> 38:47.367
I'm going to go find
out what's going on.

38:47.433 --> 38:51.667
Let me take your
cards, just in case.

39:10.400 --> 39:13.433
You think dad's okay?

39:18.133 --> 39:21.833
-- this guy just comes at
me. In the corridor.

39:21.900 --> 39:25.467
I'm on my way down to
see you and-- pow.

39:25.533 --> 39:27.633
Pow?

39:27.700 --> 39:30.400
Yeah, he starts
trash-talking me.

39:30.467 --> 39:35.733
You can't tolerate that in a
place like this. So, I respond.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.400
Of course you did.

39:38.467 --> 39:44.700
Yeah, I gave it back to
him, and he swings on me.

39:44.767 --> 39:46.300
That's the best
you can do?

39:46.367 --> 39:49.333
You get into a fight ten
minutes before we get here?

39:49.400 --> 39:51.100
I didn't start this.

39:51.167 --> 39:55.200
You wanted to get your
visitation privileges revoked.

39:59.067 --> 40:01.467
You just can't do the
right thing for your kids.

40:01.533 --> 40:02.667
I did not start this.

40:02.733 --> 40:05.733
You never do.

40:05.800 --> 40:08.800
Taking responsibility requires
maturity and that is a burden

40:08.867 --> 40:13.867
you put on everybody else,
including Cameron and Mariah.

40:13.933 --> 40:16.033
I've got bigger problems
than this, okay?

40:16.100 --> 40:18.233
I don't need to hear you
complaining because things

40:18.300 --> 40:21.000
aren't going your way. I got
my privileges are revoked,

40:21.067 --> 40:24.300
there's nothing I
can do about it.

40:26.067 --> 40:29.867
You'll never understand how
hard it was for those kids to

40:29.933 --> 40:35.300
make this trip, and now they
have to turn around and go home.

40:35.367 --> 40:37.367
My home.
Their home.

40:37.433 --> 40:42.067
They're going to be so
hurt and disappointed.

40:42.133 --> 40:46.567
Here's the good news: you
don't have to worry about it,

40:46.633 --> 40:49.200
because I'm going to
take care of your kids.

40:49.267 --> 40:55.267
The way you never have.
Happy birthday.

41:20.233 --> 41:23.067

early start on dinner

41:23.100 --> 41:25.733
so we can hear all the --

41:29.667 --> 41:32.433
What happened?

41:32.500 --> 41:38.400
He was sick.
We didn't see him.

41:38.467 --> 41:40.067
At least he knows you're
thinking about him

41:40.100 --> 41:42.867
on his birthday.

41:42.933 --> 41:44.767
Look, we don't
have to eat right now.

41:44.833 --> 41:47.667
If you guys aren't up
for it, no big deal.

41:52.067 --> 41:55.367
I could be hungry.

41:55.433 --> 41:58.733
I love corn on the cob.

41:58.800 --> 42:02.500
Besides dad's birthday, Aunt
Allison just closed a big case

42:02.567 --> 42:04.200
yesterday, right?

42:04.267 --> 42:06.600
I did. Thanks.

42:06.667 --> 42:09.867
And Rachel finally got her
hair back under control.

42:09.933 --> 42:13.267
And Jeff tried to get his
mouth back under control.

42:13.333 --> 42:17.433
See?
Plenty to celebrate.

42:17.500 --> 42:20.967
Well all right.
Let's do this!

42:21.067 --> 42:25.900
