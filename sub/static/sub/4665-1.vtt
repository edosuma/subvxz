01:49.673 --> 01:52.608
No, man. And now you've been
going around with Big Ass.

01:52.676 --> 01:55.270
You talking about Linda from Parkview?
- Yes, Big Ass.

01:56.280 --> 01:59.841
Hey, hey! Slow down right here.
Slow down.

01:59.917 --> 02:01.384
She a ho, huh?
- What?

02:01.452 --> 02:03.181
I said, she a ho!
- No!

02:04.221 --> 02:07.748
Yo, Billy. Go.
- Stop! Stop! What the hell you doing?

02:07.825 --> 02:09.883
Billy, stop this car, man!

02:17.901 --> 02:18.993
J.D.?

02:19.937 --> 02:23.737
What the helI's wrong with you man?
What the helI's wrong with you, fool?

02:23.807 --> 02:26.241
I knew it.
- Get that flashlight out of my face!

02:27.444 --> 02:30.038
Hey, what the helI's wrong with you?

02:30.214 --> 02:32.739
I thought you said "go."
- I did not say "go"!

02:32.816 --> 02:36.411
I remember the last thing we were
talking about was Linda from Parkview...

02:36.487 --> 02:37.818
and you said she...
- "Ho"!

02:37.888 --> 02:39.981
I said, Linda is a ho!

02:40.390 --> 02:42.654
Get the goddamn chain! Come on, man!

02:43.060 --> 02:46.257
Let's go! Come on. Move it!
Pull the chain, fool!

02:46.330 --> 02:47.661
Take the moneybag, let's do it!

02:47.731 --> 02:50.131
Come on. We're about to get paid, baby!

02:50.234 --> 02:51.223
Let's go.

02:51.301 --> 02:53.633
We're about to get paid!
- I'm gonna get this.

02:53.704 --> 02:55.968
This ain't Christian, but it's gonna do.

02:56.039 --> 02:58.166
Come on get in! Throw it up in there!

02:58.242 --> 02:59.607
Go!

03:01.779 --> 03:04.475
What the hell?
- Cars ain't made like they used to, man.

03:04.548 --> 03:05.810
What did you tie it to?
- What?

03:05.883 --> 03:08.283
Get out and get it!
- Why I got to get out to get it?

03:08.352 --> 03:09.717
Get it.

03:09.787 --> 03:11.345
All right, here we go, baby!

03:11.421 --> 03:13.855
Let's go.
- Here we go, baby! Here we go!

03:13.924 --> 03:15.391
Come to Daddy!

03:18.929 --> 03:22.126
The future's behind us, baby!
That is our future behind us.

03:41.151 --> 03:42.675
No!

03:44.321 --> 03:47.051
Calvin, what are you doing?
- Hey, baby.

03:47.124 --> 03:50.992
Trying to get this studio together
so we can finally make money off this stuff.

03:51.061 --> 03:55.088
That's what you said about
the T-shirt company and Herbalife vitamins.

03:55.365 --> 03:58.425
Why you gotta bring that up?
That's in the past.

03:58.502 --> 04:00.697
This is a whole new venture for us, baby.

04:00.771 --> 04:01.760
Really?

04:01.839 --> 04:03.272
Look, let me show you something.

04:03.340 --> 04:04.864
Can I show you something?
- Yes.

04:04.942 --> 04:07.342
Let me show you.
- You've got a picture.

04:07.411 --> 04:08.400
Yes.
- Okay.

04:08.478 --> 04:12.312
See that?
That right there is Oprah's guesthouse.

04:13.283 --> 04:15.046
That's just the guesthouse.

04:15.118 --> 04:18.416
So, if Stedman act up,
this is where he gotta sleep.

04:19.189 --> 04:20.178
Okay.

04:20.958 --> 04:22.653
Why do you have this?

04:23.660 --> 04:26.493
Because that's what I'm gonna buy
for my baby.

04:27.197 --> 04:28.459
Both my babies.

04:29.800 --> 04:33.361
As soon as I get somebody,
rent out the studio, make a platinum CD...

04:33.437 --> 04:34.734
and we get paid.

04:34.805 --> 04:37.535
You don't like strangers
coming in and out of the shop.

04:37.941 --> 04:41.308
You want to have them coming
in and out of the house?

04:41.879 --> 04:45.337
It's 7:00. You gonna be late for work.
You better come on.

04:45.415 --> 04:48.475
I got some eggs for you.
You better come on and get 'em.

04:50.420 --> 04:51.910
That damn shop.

04:54.691 --> 04:57.387
Boy, they sure know how
to kill a man's dreams.

04:58.161 --> 04:59.753
Come on, Stedman.

05:01.632 --> 05:03.031
Calvin!

05:03.433 --> 05:04.457
Come here.

05:09.072 --> 05:10.266
What was that for?

05:10.607 --> 05:14.008
Well, it has been a whole two years
since you took over the barbershop.

05:14.077 --> 05:16.602
I mean, look at you.
You have hung in there.

05:17.748 --> 05:20.478
Baby, you have no idea
how proud I am of you.

05:20.884 --> 05:24.479
You know, your father would've been
proud of you, too. Come here.

05:26.490 --> 05:28.515
Okay, go.
- All right, I'm going.

05:31.461 --> 05:33.190
Stay off your feet, okay?

05:38.635 --> 05:42.093
My store! Look at my store!
It has been destroyed!

05:43.840 --> 05:46.308
Get away from my shop! Get away!

05:48.245 --> 05:50.839
No! No! No!

05:51.481 --> 05:53.108
Get away from my store!

05:55.919 --> 05:58.217
Hey, yo, brother!
- Get out!

05:58.322 --> 05:59.414
Brother!

06:00.524 --> 06:01.923
Stay strong, brother!

06:02.392 --> 06:03.791
Yeah, stay strong.

06:05.228 --> 06:06.718
Get out of here! Go on!

06:06.797 --> 06:07.786
Calvin!

06:08.231 --> 06:10.665
It's always something on a Saturday,
isn't it?

06:10.734 --> 06:12.201
What's up, Janelle?

06:13.670 --> 06:16.332
You know Tanesha Jenkins' boy
got a drug problem.

06:16.406 --> 06:19.637
You think he did that?
- Damn, girl, you gossiping already?

06:19.710 --> 06:22.110
First get your shop open.
Then start the rumors.

06:22.179 --> 06:25.410
I know you are not talking to me
about how to run my shop.

06:25.515 --> 06:28.916
I don't tell you how to run your
business over there. Anyway....

06:28.986 --> 06:30.146
Hey, did you hear...

06:30.220 --> 06:32.711
That's why your nose so big.
You too damn nosy.

06:32.789 --> 06:35.189
Hey! Did you hear about Clarinda?

06:35.359 --> 06:39.125
Her husband caught her in a prime
hoochie-koochie with another man!

07:08.925 --> 07:10.153
Hey, man.
- Calvin.

07:10.227 --> 07:11.854
How you doing?
- Fine. How you doing?

07:11.928 --> 07:15.056
I'm all right.
- Hey, what happened across the street?

07:15.132 --> 07:17.930
You know this neighborhood.
It's getting worse every day.

07:18.001 --> 07:21.095
How's Jennifer?
- She getting big.

07:21.371 --> 07:23.236
You know. Mean, too.

07:23.774 --> 07:27.335
So, got some good news for me?
- No.

07:27.811 --> 07:31.247
Calvin, I need a cut like Ronnie's last week.

07:31.314 --> 07:34.511
Little off the top, long in back,
slope to the left like Gumby.

07:34.584 --> 07:35.983
Munster front, Wyclef right.

07:36.053 --> 07:38.419
Hook that up for me.
- You got any money, Lamar?

07:38.488 --> 07:41.048
I'm gonna pay you back.
I got a Job interview.

07:41.124 --> 07:44.321
When you get that job...
- Come on, Calvin, don't do me like that.

07:44.394 --> 07:48.057
Just a little edge on there.
- I don't cut hair for free. Out the door!

07:48.131 --> 07:50.326
Calvin, your father
would have hooked me up.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.697
Go get hooked up.

07:51.768 --> 07:54.236
Come on, dog!
Don't do me like that, Calvin!

07:54.304 --> 07:56.864
See what I got to deal with every day?
- I know, but...

07:56.940 --> 07:59.408
No. Get out of here. Go!

08:04.748 --> 08:06.010
So, what did they say?

08:06.083 --> 08:08.916
The bank's not gonna give you
another loan.

08:09.586 --> 08:11.884
We've already given you
a small-business loan...

08:11.955 --> 08:15.152
and a grant that you used
on your other businesses.

08:15.725 --> 08:17.716
Calvin, you know I want to help you.

08:17.794 --> 08:21.730
But if you don't pay the property taxes,
the bank is gonna foreclose on the shop.

08:21.798 --> 08:23.129
I'm sorry.

08:24.501 --> 08:26.435
There's nobody you can talk to?

08:26.703 --> 08:27.965
Calvin...

08:28.872 --> 08:30.863
it's not gonna happen.

08:34.811 --> 08:36.711
All right. Hey, what can you do?

08:39.082 --> 08:41.948
I appreciate you coming by. I really do.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.180
Don't worry about it.

09:13.283 --> 09:15.478
How did you do this for 40 years?

09:19.256 --> 09:20.951
I gotta do my own thing.

09:35.739 --> 09:37.730
Hey, how you doing, Mr. Wallace?

09:37.807 --> 09:39.798
Yeah, this is Calvin.

09:41.311 --> 09:42.778
You know, over at the shop?

09:42.846 --> 09:47.681
I was wondering, was you still interested
in what we talked about the other day?

09:48.218 --> 09:49.310
Yeah.

09:51.087 --> 09:52.247
Okay.

09:52.956 --> 09:54.480
I'll see you then.

09:54.558 --> 09:56.890
All right. Thank you, Mr. Wallace. Okay.

09:58.762 --> 10:00.923
You got it?
- Yeah.

10:00.997 --> 10:02.589
We gonna get paid.

10:03.833 --> 10:05.824
I never knew money could be so heavy.

10:07.304 --> 10:10.068
Hey, slow down.

10:10.140 --> 10:13.041
You all right?
- Yeah. Okay, I got it now.

10:14.044 --> 10:15.909
Hell, no, man.
- What?

10:16.413 --> 10:18.745
Hey, what's up, big guy?
- What's up, player?

10:18.815 --> 10:21.147
Hey, this is my grandmama's
oxygen machine.

10:21.218 --> 10:23.448
She can't breathe without it.
Let us through.

10:23.520 --> 10:26.250
You see us carrying this thing.
Move out the way.

10:26.590 --> 10:28.820
Come on, man. This thing heavy.

10:29.492 --> 10:31.551
See, you do this all the time, man!

10:31.628 --> 10:35.155
Billy, come on.
- No, man, he do this all the time!

10:35.699 --> 10:38.031
My mama's trying to come back,
and he is doing that.

10:38.101 --> 10:39.568
It don't make no sense.

10:39.636 --> 10:41.661
That's cool. Just take it down.

10:44.341 --> 10:45.808
Kevin, come open this door!

10:46.276 --> 10:47.470
Kevin!

10:48.745 --> 10:51.908
What's wrong? Why didn't you
answer the door? You knew it was me!

10:51.982 --> 10:55.110
I worked a double last night.
I Just got home two hours ago.

10:55.185 --> 10:58.484
Don't play with me, Kevin. Where is she?

10:58.555 --> 11:01.183
Let's not do this again.
- Where is she?

11:01.258 --> 11:03.089
Wait. You ain't finished.

11:03.159 --> 11:05.354
Why don't you look under the bed?
Go ahead.

11:05.428 --> 11:08.124
I bet you I would hide a woman
under that bed.

11:08.498 --> 11:10.261
If you gonna look....

11:12.535 --> 11:14.127
I'm sorry.

11:14.471 --> 11:15.495
Terri...

11:16.072 --> 11:18.973
do I look like I'm thinking
about somebody else?

11:19.109 --> 11:20.337
I don't know.

11:20.644 --> 11:22.976
You want to know how I really feel
about you?

11:24.180 --> 11:26.080
Just think about that Babyface song.

11:27.183 --> 11:28.275
Which one?

11:29.919 --> 11:33.355
You know,
there are a lot of Babyface songs.

11:33.423 --> 11:34.947
No.
- All of them, baby.

11:35.025 --> 11:36.390
You know I do.

11:37.227 --> 11:39.923
Come on. I got some time.
Come on, real quick.

11:40.030 --> 11:42.897
Yeah.
- Well, real quick.

11:42.999 --> 11:44.728
Come on.
- Okay.

11:44.801 --> 11:46.769
No.
- Let me take my jacket off.

11:46.836 --> 11:48.463
Come on.
- Oh, yeah.

11:48.538 --> 11:51.837
Well, let me take my jacket off.
What are you doing?

11:51.908 --> 11:55.173
No, I'm just helping you
get your jacket off, baby.

11:55.645 --> 11:56.907
Who is she?

11:58.548 --> 11:59.879
I don't know.

11:59.949 --> 12:01.917
When I'm finished with her, you'll remember!

12:01.985 --> 12:03.384
I can't believe you got someone.

12:03.453 --> 12:06.013
You gonna make me catch a case
before I go to work?

12:06.089 --> 12:07.488
Where you going?
- Nowhere!

12:07.557 --> 12:09.548
Get up! I dare you!

12:09.626 --> 12:11.059
Honey, cover your face now.

12:13.563 --> 12:15.224
Hey, how can I help you today?

12:15.298 --> 12:16.287
Okay.

12:16.533 --> 12:20.196
I want a grande, triple non-fat, half-decaf...

12:20.270 --> 12:23.000
soymilk, French roast,
caramel cappuccino.

12:23.073 --> 12:24.836
Okay? Now, with just a splash...

12:24.908 --> 12:27.570
just a splash of hazelnut.

12:27.711 --> 12:28.769
Okay?

12:28.845 --> 12:31.973
And orange extract.
The extra foam in a separate cup.

12:32.349 --> 12:36.342
I'll have to spoon it on myself
because y'all never get it right.

12:36.553 --> 12:38.783
You understand? Thank you.

12:40.457 --> 12:41.685
Asshole.

12:44.761 --> 12:46.991
You have to find the guys, Officer.
- Okay.

12:47.063 --> 12:49.190
We'll take you inside
and get your information.

12:49.265 --> 12:50.960
We'll be right with you.

12:53.403 --> 12:55.030
Look at my store!

12:58.274 --> 13:01.675
Then I walked in like pah-dow!
Know what I'm saying?

13:01.745 --> 13:04.441
Ass so big, it look like
two midgets in a sleeping bag!

13:04.514 --> 13:05.538
Tyrone.

13:05.615 --> 13:09.016
Can we talk about something
other than big, fat, Juicy asses, please?

13:09.085 --> 13:11.553
We could talk about something else.
- But why?

13:12.255 --> 13:14.416
When does a woman
just have too much ass?

13:14.491 --> 13:16.857
Ass is like money.
You can never have too much.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.894
Hey, Ricky. Just the man I want to see.

13:18.962 --> 13:20.987
Hey, Ricky, yo!

13:21.064 --> 13:25.330
School these boys on your philosophy
about ass because they can't distinguish...

13:25.402 --> 13:28.098
between a woman with a big ass
and a big-ass woman.

13:28.171 --> 13:30.162
Hold tight. It's mathematics, cuz.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.537
It's the ratio.

13:31.608 --> 13:35.135
Now if you measure around
a woman's waist, right?

13:35.578 --> 13:39.070
Measure around that ass,
you come up with a ratio about 3-5.

13:39.149 --> 13:40.138
Okay.

13:40.216 --> 13:42.582
Now that means that a 24-inch waist...

13:42.652 --> 13:45.052
is gonna yield a 40-inch ass.

13:45.121 --> 13:48.181
The mathematics is correct, right?
- That's good, right?

13:48.258 --> 13:49.452
You with me?
- Yo.

13:49.526 --> 13:51.585
So give me an example.
I mean, break it down.

13:51.661 --> 13:53.060
Okay, all right.

13:53.696 --> 13:55.186
Jennifer Lopez.

13:57.901 --> 14:00.529
Right? Woman with a big ass!

14:01.504 --> 14:03.529
Now, on the other side, we got...
- Right.

14:03.706 --> 14:05.333
Mother Love.

14:06.743 --> 14:08.643
Big-ass woman!

14:13.817 --> 14:15.284
Good morning.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.251
What's up?

14:21.791 --> 14:24.555
Hey, you have any idea
who poked that hole in Samir's store?

14:24.627 --> 14:25.616
No.

14:26.095 --> 14:27.585
You sure about that?

14:30.867 --> 14:34.166
Just playing with you, man. Relax.

14:50.420 --> 14:53.912
Hey, how you doing, Detective?
What's going on across the street?

14:53.990 --> 14:57.824
I'm on this convenience store thing,
so somebody's getting locked up.

14:57.994 --> 15:01.486
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Ricky here?

15:01.764 --> 15:04.858
No, he'll be in a little later, though.

15:05.468 --> 15:07.595
You don't think he had nothing
to do with that.

15:07.670 --> 15:11.197
Ricky's been keeping his nose clean
ever since he's been working here.

15:11.274 --> 15:12.935
Hey, Rick.

15:13.142 --> 15:14.734
Come in the back?
- That's my girl.

15:14.811 --> 15:17.507
Yeah. She got big drawers.
That's all right, though.

15:22.585 --> 15:24.348
Is this chair free?

15:24.420 --> 15:27.787
I figured not. You mind
just trimming me up a little bit?

15:28.024 --> 15:30.151
Why you come over here, dog?

15:30.527 --> 15:33.087
Why you sweating me?
- Are you sweating, Richard?

15:33.162 --> 15:35.027
You're a two-time felon.

15:35.331 --> 15:38.630
One more, it's all over for you, brother.

15:39.802 --> 15:43.329
Calvin went out on a limb
for you with this Job, man.

15:43.406 --> 15:46.307
I mean, why you want to play him like that?

15:58.288 --> 16:02.748
We got a surveillance tape from the camera
at the check-cashing place next door...

16:02.825 --> 16:06.124
and by the end of the day,
I will know something.

16:07.330 --> 16:08.854
You understand?

16:11.901 --> 16:14.665
Later, Calvin.
- All right.

16:25.315 --> 16:28.113
Yeah. Yo, I got to go, man.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.779
All right, man?

16:57.880 --> 16:59.541
I love you, boo.

17:01.618 --> 17:02.812
See you later, baby.

17:15.498 --> 17:17.125
What's up, man?

17:19.569 --> 17:20.762
All right.

17:25.308 --> 17:27.208
What you singing?
- What?

17:27.443 --> 17:28.967
What are you singing at?

17:29.045 --> 17:30.512
Mind your business.

17:32.849 --> 17:34.908
Here come Jumbo Mutumbo!

17:34.984 --> 17:38.852
Where I come from,
to have girth is a sign of opulence.

17:38.921 --> 17:42.516
What the hell did he just say?
- He said in Africa, fat people got loot.

17:42.592 --> 17:45.686
I heard they circumcise women, too.
- How you gonna do that?

17:45.762 --> 17:48.492
Anything that's extra, they just clip it off.
- Come on.

17:48.564 --> 17:51.465
All right, fellas, I'm free. Who's next?
- Not me.

17:52.568 --> 17:54.058
Not me.

17:54.137 --> 17:55.627
I'm cool, man.
- Forget you.

17:55.705 --> 17:57.832
Thought you had a Negro membership card?

17:57.907 --> 18:00.341
Soaked up some BET,
memorized some Tupac.

18:00.410 --> 18:01.434
Shut up, Jimmy.

18:01.511 --> 18:04.071
Calvin wouldn't give me a chair
if I couldn't cut heads.

18:04.147 --> 18:06.377
Three days, front chair, no customers.
What's up?

18:06.449 --> 18:09.612
Kill that noise. You know everyone
starts out in the first chair.

18:09.686 --> 18:11.517
That's exactly where you started.

18:11.587 --> 18:13.646
Listen up! I don't want no trouble!

18:13.723 --> 18:17.181
Just give me your wallet and your Jewelry,
won't be no problem.

18:17.994 --> 18:19.222
Hey, don't you make me....

18:19.295 --> 18:21.388
What's wrong? You one of them rappers?

18:21.464 --> 18:23.932
What's that? You got a Rolex
or a platinum chain?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.491
Eddie.
- What?

18:26.569 --> 18:30.096
Get your ass here. Leave the boys alone!
Sit your old ass down!

18:31.474 --> 18:34.204
You read him?
That boy almost turned over the money!

18:34.277 --> 18:37.075
You all right, brother! You all right!

18:38.381 --> 18:41.544
Shaking, shaking a little bit!
He was shaking like booty meat!

18:41.617 --> 18:43.175
Wasn't it good? I had him.

18:43.252 --> 18:46.449
I had him shaking like Don Knotts
in a card game or something.

18:52.895 --> 18:56.023
Remember, we're raising money
for Johnnie Brown's raggedy shoes.

18:56.099 --> 18:57.498
Scout will be here!

18:57.567 --> 18:59.125
I need $20.

18:59.202 --> 19:01.466
Let's give it up. Come on.

19:01.537 --> 19:04.438
You all right. We need some more money.

19:04.707 --> 19:06.732
We need it right now.

19:08.277 --> 19:10.336
You smell good, Terri. ls that Obsession?

19:10.413 --> 19:11.641
Five minutes.

19:12.281 --> 19:15.409
What'd she say?
- Hey, man. Where you going?

19:15.485 --> 19:18.818
You see that attitude?
She can't cut my hair. I'll be back later.

19:18.888 --> 19:21.322
Don't be scared.
- I'm free. I'll cut your hair.

19:21.390 --> 19:22.982
No, I'm straight, dog.

19:39.108 --> 19:40.268
Motherfucker.

19:42.578 --> 19:44.603
Who drank my apple juice?

19:48.484 --> 19:50.179
Y'all don't hear me?

19:50.887 --> 19:52.684
Who drank my goddamn apple juice?

19:52.755 --> 19:53.813
Terri!

19:54.524 --> 19:56.822
Stop cussing! This ain't Def Comedy Jam.

19:56.893 --> 20:00.420
I put a big-ass red...
- Terri! Stop cussing!

20:00.963 --> 20:04.126
I put a big red sign saying:

20:04.200 --> 20:06.760
"Do not drink me."

20:06.836 --> 20:10.499
Maybe no one drank it.
Maybe it evaporated.

20:10.573 --> 20:15.203
I'll slap you. Don't get on my bad side.
You've been here just a minute.

20:15.278 --> 20:17.940
Girl, it's not like a bottle
of Hennessey or nothing!

20:18.014 --> 20:21.711
It's just some funky-ass apple juice.
- This is my funky-ass apple juice.

20:21.784 --> 20:23.649
I don't touch nobody else's stuff--

20:23.719 --> 20:24.981
Hey, Terri....
- What?

20:25.054 --> 20:26.954
Jimmy drank your apple juice.

20:27.123 --> 20:29.990
Hey, hold up...
- Why'd you touch my apple juice?

20:30.059 --> 20:31.890
Excuse me.
- I don't want your cooties.

20:31.961 --> 20:35.158
Did you see me drink it?
- I didn't have to, you asked about it.

20:35.231 --> 20:37.631
Do you have ocular proof? Did you see me?

20:37.700 --> 20:39.531
"Ocular"?
- What'd I just say?

20:39.635 --> 20:42.468
I said I didn't have to see you drink it...
- Oh, shit.

20:42.538 --> 20:44.733
I don't have to see you...
- What'd you see?

20:44.807 --> 20:46.832
Say you ain't drink it.
- Did you see...

20:46.909 --> 20:48.706
Knock his college ass out!

20:48.778 --> 20:50.837
Hey! Come on! Come on!

20:50.913 --> 20:52.938
No, Calvin, let them go!

20:53.015 --> 20:55.813
This ain't the projects.
This is a place of business.

20:55.885 --> 20:59.582
Calvin, your father wouldn't put up
with this mess. You have to handle this.

20:59.655 --> 21:02.055
Checker Fred,
just sit there and play checkers.

21:02.124 --> 21:04.649
Do I look like my father?
- Yeah.

21:05.061 --> 21:07.552
Yes, you do.
- In the nose, right here.

21:07.630 --> 21:09.188
DVDs, CDs.

21:10.032 --> 21:11.226
Not today, man.

21:11.300 --> 21:13.860
Whatever you want, man.
Got the new DMX, baby!

21:13.936 --> 21:15.369
Just go on out, go.

21:15.438 --> 21:17.167
Put somebody out. Always.

21:17.373 --> 21:19.136
I'm never coming in this shop again.

21:19.208 --> 21:22.177
lt's a possibility
that Jimmy drank your apple juice.

21:22.411 --> 21:23.844
Small possibility.

21:23.913 --> 21:27.212
But nobody saw him. You didn't see him.
So all you can ask...

21:27.283 --> 21:29.376
That's not fair, you're taking his side.

21:29.452 --> 21:31.443
I'm not taking his side. Ask the man.

21:31.520 --> 21:34.887
If he says yeah, kick his ass,
if he says no, then squash it.

21:36.926 --> 21:37.915
Ask him.

21:40.463 --> 21:42.522
Did you drink my apple juice?

21:44.133 --> 21:46.499
Did you? lnquiring minds want to know.

21:47.470 --> 21:48.698
Did you?

21:49.038 --> 21:50.130
Nope.

21:50.239 --> 21:53.174
Answered, done deal.
Come on, let me buy you some apple juice.

21:53.242 --> 21:54.937
Case closed.

21:55.044 --> 21:58.343
Well, one of y'all MFs drank it.
I'm tired of y'all, I swear!

21:58.414 --> 22:00.814
Y'all better not touch my stuff no more!

22:02.718 --> 22:04.447
Stop slamming them doors!

22:09.392 --> 22:12.361
I know it wasn't me. I'm lactose intolerant.

22:12.662 --> 22:14.391
Hey!
- Hey, girl!

22:16.766 --> 22:18.358
Damn!

22:21.170 --> 22:22.228
It's cool.

22:22.305 --> 22:24.773
Man, she messed up
your whole arrangement.

22:24.874 --> 22:27.434
How much them roses cost? $2 or $3?

22:27.543 --> 22:28.532
I'm Crazy Howard.

22:28.611 --> 22:32.103
Topping the news, Iast night someone stoIe
the new ATM machine....

22:32.181 --> 22:34.274
'Cause people can't raise their kids....

22:34.350 --> 22:35.339
Gabby!

22:40.723 --> 22:42.554
I tell you, the first thing I'll do, Joe.

22:42.625 --> 22:45.992
Player, you lock your door?
- Yeah, I ain't stupid. Come on.

22:46.629 --> 22:50.030
Then why's your sister in the room, man?
- I'll tell Mama!

22:50.099 --> 22:51.088
No.

22:51.167 --> 22:52.464
What?

22:52.535 --> 22:54.093
Close the door, dog!

22:54.370 --> 22:55.997
This is just a big video game!

22:56.072 --> 22:59.599
No, it ain't.
lt looks like a cash machine to me.

22:59.675 --> 23:02.940
And this ain't no supermarket,
so I'm gonna tell Mama.

23:03.012 --> 23:06.504
No! You can't tell nobody about this,
you hear me?

23:06.582 --> 23:07.742
Why not?

23:07.817 --> 23:10.285
'Cause I said so. I mean, think about it.

23:10.353 --> 23:13.345
Gabby, who'll take care of you?
- My mama.

23:15.358 --> 23:18.191
She got you on that.
- What can I do to keep your mouth shut?

23:18.260 --> 23:20.194
You gotta pay me.
- Pay you?

23:20.262 --> 23:22.594
I'm getting a headache. I just paid you $10!

23:22.665 --> 23:25.156
I don't care!
- Hey, dog, whup her ass.

23:25.234 --> 23:26.394
You can't touch me.

23:26.469 --> 23:28.664
I'll whup her ass.
- No, man, don't do that.

23:28.738 --> 23:31.901
You better give me my cash back later...
- I'll give it back!

23:31.974 --> 23:33.737
Take it, girl. That's all I got.

23:34.710 --> 23:36.507
Go on, get out of the room there, girl!

23:38.014 --> 23:39.106
Go on!

23:39.181 --> 23:40.170
Get on!

23:42.485 --> 23:45.750
That's how you lock a door, dog.

23:47.189 --> 23:49.054
What?
- It's your fault, man!

23:49.492 --> 23:52.052
Now we've gotta take this someplace else.

23:52.128 --> 23:55.620
I've gotta think how.
- The same way we stole it, the truck.

23:55.698 --> 23:59.361
I said I'm not messing with my
crazy-ass cousin no more. He too violent.

23:59.435 --> 24:02.029
He comes from a broken home.
He don't even know his mama.

24:02.104 --> 24:03.799
And after last night...

24:04.373 --> 24:06.807
I ain't messing with that fool no more.

24:06.876 --> 24:10.403
We wouldn't be doing this if you'd locked...
- I did lock the door.

24:10.479 --> 24:12.447
Your sister's a demon child.
- Whatever, man.

24:12.515 --> 24:15.484
Your mama don't have real silverware,
so we could get in here?

24:15.718 --> 24:16.707
Whatever.

24:19.889 --> 24:22.323
Oh, come on, man. Let's just take it up.

24:22.391 --> 24:24.256
Hey, Billy, take it down.

24:24.527 --> 24:25.892
Wait a minute....

24:26.429 --> 24:27.657
Take it down.

24:28.330 --> 24:30.491
Come on, player. Come on, big man.

24:32.401 --> 24:33.766
We'll get you this time.

24:33.836 --> 24:35.201
Push it through.

24:36.338 --> 24:37.430
My finger!

24:37.706 --> 24:39.901
This ain't gonna fit.

24:40.810 --> 24:42.004
My hand!

24:46.649 --> 24:48.082
My hand!

24:50.319 --> 24:52.514
You got it?
- I don't have it.

24:54.690 --> 24:56.123
This is good chicken, too.

24:58.260 --> 24:59.557
You ever had this chicken?

24:59.628 --> 25:02.722
How can you sit there with all that chicken
and not offer us any?

25:02.798 --> 25:04.163
I paid for this.

25:04.600 --> 25:08.468
You give me a quarter,
I might give you a little mashed potatoes.

25:09.105 --> 25:12.506
How come he can eat out front, while we...
- 'Cause Eddie's old, man.

25:12.575 --> 25:16.136
You see that right there?
You know what that means?

25:16.212 --> 25:18.237
That means I've got senroyity.

25:18.714 --> 25:20.705
S-who?
- Senroyity.

25:21.150 --> 25:22.879
Don't you mean "seniority"?

25:22.985 --> 25:23.974
Whatever.

25:24.053 --> 25:28.251
That's nothing but gray hair poking up out
your follicle. lt means nothing.

25:28.324 --> 25:31.054
Don't mean anything?
Let me tell you something, boy.

25:31.127 --> 25:34.153
I was here in '68 when they robbed
and burned down...

25:34.230 --> 25:36.198
everything here but this barbershop.

25:36.265 --> 25:39.860
I was here in '74,
when desegregation started...

25:39.935 --> 25:43.666
and they bussing in white kids,
and bussing out little black kids like you.

25:43.739 --> 25:45.036
Yeah, I remember that.

25:45.107 --> 25:47.098
And then I was here in '77...

25:47.176 --> 25:49.838
when Walter Payton came in here...

25:49.912 --> 25:54.611
the day after he had rushed
275 yards against Minnesota.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.514
And I lined him up in this chair...

25:56.585 --> 25:58.849
and I got the picture to prove it.

25:58.988 --> 26:01.513
Eddie, how do we know
that's really Payton?

26:02.892 --> 26:04.655
That's Walter. That's him.

26:05.594 --> 26:08.188
The signature says "Sweetness" right there!

26:08.264 --> 26:09.629
What more do you want?

26:09.698 --> 26:11.359
I don't know, a real picture?

26:11.433 --> 26:13.060
That's "Sweetness" all right.

26:15.304 --> 26:17.772
What did you do? I got a patch in my head!

26:18.107 --> 26:19.802
Patch the little boy's head up.

26:19.875 --> 26:22.503
I told you to keep still...
- I got a patch on my head!

26:22.578 --> 26:24.739
Shame, you put a patch on the boy's head.

26:24.813 --> 26:27.111
Got him looking like 101 DaImatians.

26:27.216 --> 26:30.117
You heard of that movie?
Looks like a Dalmatian, that's 102!

26:30.186 --> 26:31.414
Mind your business.

26:31.487 --> 26:33.648
I didn't move my head! lt's not my fault!

26:33.722 --> 26:35.246
Man, why do I gotta...

26:35.324 --> 26:37.690
You look good.
- Take care of the thing.

26:37.893 --> 26:40.418
Quit talking, more cut.
Wait till my mom gets here.

26:40.496 --> 26:41.861
I've got it now.

26:42.031 --> 26:43.760
Jimmy, what are you doing?

26:45.668 --> 26:47.932
Got that little boy looking like a leopard.

26:48.003 --> 26:52.064
He needs little spots all around.
Look at him!

27:13.329 --> 27:14.489
Don't ignore me.

27:14.563 --> 27:15.962
Don't ignore me like that.

27:16.031 --> 27:17.521
Turn their heads....

27:17.666 --> 27:19.258
How's everybody doing?

27:25.207 --> 27:26.196
My bad.

27:36.185 --> 27:38.278
Clean you up or something?

27:38.554 --> 27:40.647
How you doing, Mr. Wallace?
- How you doing?

27:40.723 --> 27:43.317
Good to see you, thanks for coming.
- Yes, indeed.

27:43.392 --> 27:44.916
Wanna go out back and talk?
- Yeah.

27:44.994 --> 27:46.086
All right.

27:47.196 --> 27:48.788
Eddie.
- Nigger.

27:52.368 --> 27:54.563
Calvin, I'm glad you called me back.

27:56.105 --> 27:58.505
I was beginning to think
you don't like Lester.

27:58.574 --> 28:02.340
Heard you just bought Big CarI's Auto Shop.
Left everything the same.

28:02.778 --> 28:05.406
I was hoping you'd do the same thing here.

28:05.714 --> 28:08.205
I told you, I'm a man of my word.

28:09.551 --> 28:10.882
You know, Calvin...

28:11.287 --> 28:13.755
if you can't make the payments...

28:13.822 --> 28:15.756
you're gonna lose the shop...

28:15.824 --> 28:17.314
and have nothing.

28:17.526 --> 28:19.653
Or, if you sell it to me...

28:19.895 --> 28:24.127
you make sure that the sign outside
always says "barbershop."

28:28.270 --> 28:29.794
I can live with that.

28:30.406 --> 28:34.809
If you take this money,
that's as good as a contract.

28:35.544 --> 28:39.571
I wouldn't want to have
any misappropriations going on up in here.

28:45.354 --> 28:46.821
Yeah, me neither.

28:48.857 --> 28:51.985
You know,
I made your father the same offer...

28:52.561 --> 28:53.994
but he turned it down.

28:54.063 --> 28:57.328
But you're a better businessman.
You got vision.

29:00.803 --> 29:02.430
$20,000, that's your buyout.

29:02.504 --> 29:04.495
I'll manage bank payments, as discussed.

29:04.573 --> 29:07.133
And I'll get the paperwork to you next week.

29:07.843 --> 29:08.935
Okay.

29:09.978 --> 29:12.913
You're sure you're gonna keep
the barbershop open, right?

29:12.981 --> 29:17.611
I'm a businessman, and a
barbershop ain't exactly a cash cow.

29:19.021 --> 29:21.353
So I'll turn it into a gentlemen's club.

29:21.423 --> 29:24.950
Wait a minute.
That's not what we discussed, Mr. Wallace.

29:25.461 --> 29:29.363
You told me that the sign outside
would always say "barbershop."

29:29.431 --> 29:30.693
It will.

29:31.934 --> 29:35.426
It's gonna be called "The Barbershop."
I'll keep that same theme going.

29:35.504 --> 29:37.495
The girls dressed like little barbers.

29:37.573 --> 29:40.133
You can come in, and they'll give you a trim.

29:40.209 --> 29:42.109
And you can get some trim.

29:44.580 --> 29:46.104
Hold it, Mr. Wallace.

29:48.450 --> 29:49.747
Mr. Wallace!

29:52.321 --> 29:53.811
You have a nice day.

30:02.197 --> 30:06.156
I just don't understand why someone
would drive into the store like that.

30:06.235 --> 30:09.762
Now, see, I told Sitting Bull
across the street over there...

30:09.838 --> 30:11.931
not to put no cash machine in his store...

30:12.007 --> 30:14.567
'cause black people
don't know how to act.

30:14.643 --> 30:17.703
Who're you telling?
That's why black people can't have nothing.

30:17.780 --> 30:20.442
Apparently, neither can lndian folks.
Give me! Move!

30:20.516 --> 30:24.077
Samir is not Indian, okay?
He's Pakistani. He's from Pakistan.

30:24.153 --> 30:28.453
All I know is, he can pack and stand
his ass on that corner all he want to.

30:28.524 --> 30:32.551
But if Geronimo keeps on, somebody's
liable to bust a cap in his ass, right?

30:32.628 --> 30:35.392
Right, Eddie, he's gonna get it!
- He's gonna pah-yow!

30:35.464 --> 30:37.432
Samir is not Native American, okay?

30:37.499 --> 30:41.367
He's not Arab, he's not Mexican,
he's not Eskimo. He is from Pakistan.

30:41.437 --> 30:44.565
Pakistan, yakistan, you-back-istan.
I don't care where he's from.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.369
He ain't from here, I know that.

30:46.442 --> 30:49.138
He ain't gonna win in the South Side, either.

30:52.147 --> 30:54.115
Damn, speaking of Pakistan....

30:56.251 --> 30:57.616
That's all right!

30:58.320 --> 31:00.550
Boy, what's wrong with you?

31:00.622 --> 31:02.590
He cut a patch in the back of my head.

31:02.658 --> 31:05.559
I'm sorry, ma'am, it wasn't my fault.
He kept moving, so...

31:05.627 --> 31:07.822
I did not, I did not keep moving.

31:08.997 --> 31:09.986
Bless her.

31:10.065 --> 31:13.091
You know you kept moving.
- What're you talking about?

31:13.569 --> 31:15.560
It don't look that bad.
- Yes, it does.

31:15.637 --> 31:17.229
Think of it as a new style.

31:17.306 --> 31:21.106
Before you know it, everybody'll be
walking around with a patch in their head.

31:21.176 --> 31:24.145
Why would people walk around
with a patch in their head?

31:24.213 --> 31:26.977
So, that makes it free, right?

31:27.382 --> 31:28.713
Ain't that right?

31:28.951 --> 31:30.145
Right?

31:34.456 --> 31:35.514
Okay.

31:39.495 --> 31:40.484
Come on.

31:43.966 --> 31:46.332
Jimmy will never touch your head again,
I promise.

31:46.401 --> 31:47.390
Thank you.

31:49.605 --> 31:51.766
Damn!

31:52.140 --> 31:55.974
Hey, babe, me and her, mostly me, I tell you!

31:56.545 --> 31:58.843
Come on, man, this thing heavy, dog.

31:59.948 --> 32:01.176
I'll take it.

32:01.383 --> 32:02.873
Damn, my phone's ringing.

32:02.951 --> 32:04.748
J.D.
- What?

32:05.187 --> 32:06.916
Would you please back up?

32:07.556 --> 32:08.716
My bad.

32:08.790 --> 32:12.157
Thank you. I couldn't breathe.
- Come on, man, get in there.

32:12.494 --> 32:13.756
Open the door.

32:14.396 --> 32:16.023
Is that that punk Jay?

32:18.767 --> 32:20.632
My foot!
- Jay! You all right?

32:20.702 --> 32:22.465
Jay! Come here, you punk!

32:22.771 --> 32:24.671
I'm gonna get your black ass.

32:28.977 --> 32:30.137
Billy!

32:38.387 --> 32:39.376
Get up!

32:39.821 --> 32:40.913
Come here!

32:43.091 --> 32:44.183
Billy!

32:48.630 --> 32:50.723
What the hell are you doing, man?

32:52.434 --> 32:54.459
Man, you just let him get away.

32:54.670 --> 32:56.865
He owes me $5 from a crap game.

32:56.939 --> 32:58.770
I ain't paying your ass nothing!

32:58.840 --> 33:00.137
What?
- Billy!

33:01.276 --> 33:04.473
Bring your ass back over here!
- Lucky I ain't got my Jordans on!

33:04.546 --> 33:06.810
Come on, Billy,
bring your ass back over here.

33:08.116 --> 33:09.344
$5!

33:09.985 --> 33:12.681
You gonna cause a scene in public for $5?

33:12.754 --> 33:14.187
Man, he owes me money.

33:14.256 --> 33:16.850
We've got $50,000 back at the motel.

33:18.393 --> 33:20.953
You're gonna cause a scene for $5?

33:21.897 --> 33:23.125
$5?

33:23.599 --> 33:26.227
It ain't even about the money.
It's the principle.

33:26.301 --> 33:28.166
What?
- That's right, the principle.

33:28.236 --> 33:29.567
He's supposed to pay.

33:29.638 --> 33:33.005
This is Chi-Town's finest,
and I ain't going out like no sucker.

33:33.241 --> 33:35.607
You ain't going out like no sucker?
- No.

33:36.845 --> 33:39.473
You know what, player?
We're gonna get caught.

33:39.781 --> 33:41.612
And you wanna know why?
- Why?

33:41.683 --> 33:44.675
There's a stupid nigger in every bunch,
who messes up everybody.

33:44.753 --> 33:46.015
You know what?

33:48.056 --> 33:49.717
You that dumb nigger.

33:49.791 --> 33:51.759
You know what? I tell you this.

33:51.827 --> 33:54.227
If he owed you money,
you'd be chasing him, too.

33:54.296 --> 33:58.062
I would've whupped him last week.
- Why you think I was chasing him? What....

33:58.133 --> 33:59.122
Shit!

34:00.268 --> 34:02.327
What? Keep it moving.

34:02.804 --> 34:04.601
Ain't nothing to see here.

34:05.007 --> 34:07.407
Come on, man. I lost my head.

34:07.476 --> 34:10.239
But you understand, it wasn't just money.
- $5, player?

34:10.312 --> 34:13.577
I'm telling you, they got about
$15,000 or $20,000 in that ATM.

34:13.649 --> 34:14.638
$15,000?

34:14.716 --> 34:17.116
Those machines are worth
more than the money in them.

34:17.185 --> 34:19.152
There may be a reward.
- For an ATM machine?

34:19.221 --> 34:21.188
I wish the money in it was mine.

34:21.255 --> 34:25.283
I'd use that money, I'd take my girl out
to a real nice dinner, like Red Lobster.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.385
See, now that's upscale.

34:27.462 --> 34:30.487
Red Lobster is the IHOP of shellfish.
That is not upscale.

34:30.565 --> 34:33.033
I don't hate cheese toast
just 'cause I'm eating...

34:33.101 --> 34:35.331
scampis and shrimps
and scallops and shit.

34:35.404 --> 34:36.768
You are truly ignorant.

34:36.838 --> 34:38.271
You don't know what a scallop is.

34:38.340 --> 34:40.137
It ain't even a shellfish.

34:40.208 --> 34:41.766
Did you know you get on my nerves?

34:41.842 --> 34:42.867
Condoms.

34:42.944 --> 34:45.435
Pampers if you're too late.
- What's with the dogs?

34:45.514 --> 34:47.708
Get them dogs out of here.
- You like dogs.

34:47.783 --> 34:49.978
Don't make me smack you.
- I told you once.

34:50.052 --> 34:52.987
Y'all need some dogs
I got this one, if you buy this one...

34:53.054 --> 34:55.751
you get this one half off.
- Don't come back, man.

34:55.824 --> 34:59.385
Going home. I'm never coming
in this shop again. I work for me.

35:04.599 --> 35:06.089
Calvin, what that boy name?

35:06.168 --> 35:08.534
I've told you four times, that's Ricky.

35:08.670 --> 35:09.694
Hold still.

35:09.771 --> 35:11.932
What?
- What do you think you doing?

35:12.007 --> 35:15.101
I'm just trying to get him clean
like them Gillette commercials.

35:15.177 --> 35:18.977
That's the problem with y'all today.
Y'all don't know nothing.

35:19.047 --> 35:23.643
Sit up there, just watch too much TV
and listen to that Jigga Ray...

35:23.719 --> 35:26.813
and all them folk up in there,
hippity-hoppity nonsense...

35:26.888 --> 35:29.880
and don't know nothing.
Let me. Sir, you mind?

35:31.126 --> 35:33.993
Rick, get that off there, and lean him back.

35:35.964 --> 35:38.125
Roots, get me a hot towel.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.532
Dinka, Eddie. Dinka.

35:41.436 --> 35:43.700
These young boys don't know nothing.

35:44.172 --> 35:46.106
Let me get you lathered up here.

35:47.442 --> 35:49.239
Put that towel on his face.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.048
Get your foam nice and lathery.

35:54.416 --> 35:56.543
Y'all come over here and learn something.

35:56.618 --> 36:00.281
You finish that up. Put that on there.
Put that on the side over there.

36:00.355 --> 36:04.291
See, in my day,
a barber was more than just somebody...

36:04.359 --> 36:08.227
who sit around in a FUBU shirt
with his drawers hanging all out.

36:09.698 --> 36:13.759
In my day, a barber was a counselor.

36:14.136 --> 36:16.832
He was a fashion expert.

36:18.974 --> 36:21.067
A style coach. Pimp.

36:21.143 --> 36:22.940
Just general, all-around hustler.

36:23.011 --> 36:26.674
But the problem with y'all cats today...

36:27.516 --> 36:28.710
is that...

36:29.918 --> 36:31.283
you got no skill.

36:32.254 --> 36:34.017
No sense of history.

36:35.257 --> 36:38.317
And then, with a straight face...

36:38.760 --> 36:41.092
got the nerve to want to be somebody.

36:41.163 --> 36:42.926
Want somebody to respect you.

36:42.998 --> 36:46.058
But it takes respect to get respect.
Understand?

36:46.935 --> 36:48.368
See, I'm old.

36:48.804 --> 36:50.601
But, Lord willing...

36:51.673 --> 36:55.973
I'd be spared the sight
of seeing everything that we worked for...

36:57.212 --> 36:59.009
flushed down the drain...

36:59.080 --> 37:01.776
by someone who don't know no better...

37:02.284 --> 37:03.308
or care.

37:03.385 --> 37:05.785
Calvin.
- Hey, baby.

37:05.854 --> 37:07.446
Can we talk in the back?

37:07.522 --> 37:10.355
That's coming right on off there.
See, that's smooth.

37:10.425 --> 37:14.225
When he get through, his face gonna
be real smooth, like Gary Coleman.

37:16.431 --> 37:18.365
Calvin, baby, what's going on?

37:18.466 --> 37:19.558
What you mean?

37:19.634 --> 37:23.070
Janelle called me and said that
she saw Lester Wallace in here.

37:23.138 --> 37:25.402
Why Janelle won't stay out
my business? God.

37:25.473 --> 37:28.636
When did you start doing business
with a loan shark like him?

37:28.710 --> 37:30.974
Lester Wallace is not a loan shark.
- Really?

37:31.046 --> 37:33.139
He's just a businessman from the street.

37:33.215 --> 37:35.809
Okay, but wait. Why was he here?

37:35.884 --> 37:37.476
To get a haircut.

37:37.986 --> 37:40.511
Calvin, Lester Wallace wears a hairpiece.

37:42.524 --> 37:45.857
He had to get that faded a little bit.
So, I just....

37:45.927 --> 37:48.623
No? All right. Come here.
Let me show you something.

37:48.697 --> 37:52.064
I'll show you something
that's gonna make you much happier.

37:58.006 --> 37:59.473
Check it out.

38:07.782 --> 38:09.374
What did you do?

38:09.784 --> 38:11.115
I sold the barbershop.

38:11.186 --> 38:13.654
You sold your father's barbershop
to Lester Wallace?

38:13.722 --> 38:14.882
Don't, "shh" me.

38:15.557 --> 38:18.151
We're trying to get
our recording studio started.

38:18.226 --> 38:20.251
Recording studio? Have you forgotten?

38:20.328 --> 38:22.694
You almost
electrocuted yourself this morning.

38:22.764 --> 38:25.756
What matters is, I made this move for us.
This is for us.

38:25.834 --> 38:27.495
Us?
- Yes.

38:28.003 --> 38:29.095
Tell me something.

38:29.170 --> 38:32.037
Why is it you make all these
spontaneous decisions...

38:32.107 --> 38:34.405
and then we got to get us out of it?

38:34.476 --> 38:35.465
Baby....

38:35.677 --> 38:39.135
I had to do something to get the monkey
off our back. That's what I did.

38:39.214 --> 38:42.672
But, listen.
Your grandfather opened this shop.

38:42.851 --> 38:45.752
He handed it down to your father,
who left it to you.

38:46.154 --> 38:50.591
And all he did was give away free haircuts.
Now they want freebies.

38:51.359 --> 38:55.591
He let all those barbers in there
use their station whenever they wanted to...

38:55.664 --> 38:59.361
pay rent whenever they wanted to,
and we're in debt because of that.

38:59.434 --> 39:00.924
It's because of him.

39:01.603 --> 39:03.833
I'm not gonna work my ass off for that.

39:04.039 --> 39:05.700
Dinka. What're they saying?

39:05.774 --> 39:10.211
Something about a monkey coming back.
But his ass has too much pressure.

39:17.686 --> 39:20.621
You deserve more than this.
I'm trying to give you the world.

39:20.689 --> 39:22.714
You know what? I don't need the world.

39:22.791 --> 39:24.588
I don't need Oprah's house.

39:25.226 --> 39:27.854
It's not Oprah's house.
It's Stedman's guesthouse...

39:27.929 --> 39:31.126
and it's a five-bedroom,
four-and-a-half bath...

39:31.199 --> 39:33.565
with a Jacuzzi, pool...
- Listen.

39:33.635 --> 39:35.398
This shop had very little debt until...

39:35.470 --> 39:39.270
you started spending all the money
on those get-rich-quick schemes.

39:40.008 --> 39:43.000
It's my fault?
Let me hear you say it. It's my fault?

39:43.144 --> 39:44.441
Well, yeah, it's your fault.

39:44.512 --> 39:47.276
How is it my fault,
and I'm just trying to better myself?

39:47.349 --> 39:50.580
Wait a minute, I see what this is about.
This is about you.

39:52.687 --> 39:54.382
Okay.
- No.

39:55.824 --> 39:57.621
You know what? I mean, think about it.

39:57.692 --> 40:00.718
How could you sell this place?
I met you here.

40:01.696 --> 40:05.291
My father used to come here every Saturday.
He loved this place.

40:05.367 --> 40:08.530
You used to love it, too. What happened?

40:13.441 --> 40:16.501
You know what?
This is a little too much for me right now.

40:16.578 --> 40:19.604
You gonna mess around
and send me into premature labor.

40:19.681 --> 40:23.378
I can't believe you sold your father's shop.
- Jennifer....

40:32.093 --> 40:34.220
Still couldn't hear nothing.

40:34.829 --> 40:36.626
Can you help me with this shoe?

40:38.800 --> 40:41.360
From the heel, dog. Let the toe go.

40:47.208 --> 40:49.870
Pull this sock off for me, too.
- Are these socks clean?

40:49.944 --> 40:51.969
They're my mama's socks, man.

40:52.447 --> 40:54.642
You know we wear the same size shoe?

40:57.419 --> 41:00.820
Damn. You need a Band-Aid, man.
I'm going to go get that for you.

41:00.889 --> 41:04.325
Oh, no. Hey. I'll go get the Band-Aid.

41:04.392 --> 41:06.656
'Cause you can't seem to do nothing right.

41:06.728 --> 41:08.855
You just stay here, work on the ATM.

41:10.031 --> 41:12.761
Damn. I mean, man, your foot's Jacked up.

41:13.168 --> 41:15.159
lt isn't nothing but some dead skin.

41:15.236 --> 41:19.400
All I need is some cocoa butter.
I can get that. Excuse me, player.

41:19.474 --> 41:20.771
Excuse me, dog.

41:21.376 --> 41:22.536
Oh, my God.
- Oh, God!

41:28.249 --> 41:30.410
Okay, man, are we straight or what?

41:37.625 --> 41:39.957
Next.
- Hold on, man.

41:44.299 --> 41:46.324
$20, man.
- All right.

41:47.202 --> 41:50.899
Here's a little something extra
for Johnnie's shoe fund. Take care.

41:54.542 --> 41:57.170
Hold on, player.
- Wait!

41:57.312 --> 41:59.075
Hey, hook me up, Cal.

41:59.147 --> 42:01.377
See, I was next.
- No, I was here earlier.

42:01.449 --> 42:02.973
You got any money?

42:03.051 --> 42:05.417
-Man, I got your money--
-See, I got money too.

42:05.487 --> 42:06.886
I'll do you next.

42:08.523 --> 42:10.923
Sit over there, fish. I'll do you next.

42:11.159 --> 42:12.786
Either that or go see Eddie.

42:12.861 --> 42:15.159
I'm busy.
- I don't want to see Eddie.

42:15.230 --> 42:17.095
That's right. Come on. Take care.

42:17.165 --> 42:20.794
You know I got stuff to do, man.
Get these nose hairs for me.

42:20.869 --> 42:22.234
Nose hairs?

42:22.437 --> 42:25.964
You ain't got my money,
I'm going to get them ass hairs for you.

42:26.641 --> 42:29.804
I hear that Evander Holyfield
gonna put a Red Lobster in a church.

42:29.878 --> 42:32.039
How is he gonna call himself a man of God?

42:32.113 --> 42:33.740
You know what? You're right.

42:33.815 --> 42:37.444
When he down there in Georgia,
slinging his thing through half the state.

42:37.519 --> 42:40.579
I bet that you all didn't even know
Jesus wasn't a Christian.

42:40.655 --> 42:42.088
He was a Jew.

42:42.157 --> 42:43.749
Hey, Jimmy.
- Yo.

42:44.626 --> 42:47.959
Why you always throwing out random trivia,
like you know everything?

42:48.029 --> 42:51.192
I don't think I know everything,
I'm saying that being educated...

42:51.266 --> 42:53.461
guarantees I won't spend
my life behind bars.

42:53.535 --> 42:56.527
That's what this is about?
Me being in the pen?

42:56.604 --> 42:59.095
I'm just saying...
- Who you talking about?

42:59.174 --> 43:02.905
I'm just saying, being educated means
you have opportunities.

43:02.977 --> 43:05.605
And the rest of us are doing what?
Biding our time?

43:05.680 --> 43:07.841
Can you guys stop arguing for once?

43:08.416 --> 43:12.944
You're like a bunch of little kids.
Back and forth. I'm getting a headache.

43:13.021 --> 43:15.182
That's cool. I'm not gonna get worked up.

43:15.256 --> 43:17.588
This isn't the end of the line
for Jimmy James.

43:17.659 --> 43:18.683
Well, leave.

43:18.760 --> 43:20.728
You could do a lot worse
than being a barber.

43:20.795 --> 43:22.490
And a lot better.

43:22.564 --> 43:25.863
And don't hate me 'cause I'm
trying to make something of myself.

43:25.934 --> 43:29.199
Black Picasso of the ghetto!
- Barber's a respectable occupation.

43:29.270 --> 43:31.261
I'll have my own mural, my own shop.

43:31.339 --> 43:34.775
I might even take over this shop
if Calvin don't give it to his son.

43:34.842 --> 43:38.039
Let me tell you something.
You will never own a black barbershop.

43:38.112 --> 43:41.104
I will if I want to.
- If Tony Roma can make ribs better...

43:41.182 --> 43:43.878
than black people,
Isaac can own a black barbershop.

43:43.952 --> 43:45.579
Ribs better than black people?

43:45.653 --> 43:49.180
You want some good ribs?
You should go over to C&K on 75th.

43:49.257 --> 43:51.987
Tony Roma boils his ribs.
That is not authentic.

43:53.394 --> 43:55.385
No. Tony Roma's is delicious.

43:55.463 --> 43:57.795
You know, I don't see white or black.

43:57.865 --> 44:00.629
I just see red sauce on everything.

44:01.202 --> 44:02.533
Well, you're new here.

44:02.604 --> 44:04.572
He don't boil his ribs.
- I like them.

44:04.639 --> 44:06.334
Know what? Jimmy got a point.

44:06.407 --> 44:08.807
Because nobody in here
want to be a barber...

44:08.876 --> 44:10.639
for the rest of their life.

44:10.712 --> 44:12.873
Thank you. That's all I'm saying.

44:12.947 --> 44:14.278
I like cutting hair.

44:14.349 --> 44:18.012
Wait a minute. A barber is a craftsman.
I mean, it's respectable.

44:18.086 --> 44:20.213
And I must admit I like it.

44:20.288 --> 44:22.188
So I guess I agree with Terri.

44:23.124 --> 44:25.388
You agree with everything Terri say.

44:25.593 --> 44:28.528
Watch it, Jimmy.
- You a hater.

44:29.397 --> 44:31.456
No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

44:31.833 --> 44:32.993
Hey, Lamar.

44:33.501 --> 44:35.867
Run, nigger. Look at him go.

44:35.937 --> 44:37.427
Be right back.

44:40.375 --> 44:44.175
Hey, Lamar.
Don't bring your skinny ass back.

44:47.081 --> 44:50.539
See that? That's why you can't have
no business in the ghetto.

44:56.691 --> 44:58.682
You must not know me.

44:59.227 --> 45:01.286
Well, I'm Chi-Town's finest.

45:01.429 --> 45:03.522
I'll whup into you like that, boy.

45:07.435 --> 45:09.699
Now, I'm gonna have to poke you.

45:10.471 --> 45:12.268
Oh, I think I got it.

45:12.674 --> 45:14.608
Just give us the money.

45:19.814 --> 45:21.577
What's my mama's code?

45:25.820 --> 45:27.219
Thank you, cutie.

45:27.288 --> 45:29.779
You're welcome, my beautiful black sister.

45:31.359 --> 45:32.690
What's up, little man?

45:32.760 --> 45:34.387
I got an announcement to make.

45:34.462 --> 45:35.986
I bought some more apple juice.

45:36.064 --> 45:38.294
And I want nobody in here to drink it.

45:38.366 --> 45:41.802
Have some respect and decency
for other people's stuff.

45:41.869 --> 45:44.633
What you looking at me for?
- Because I know you drank it.

45:44.706 --> 45:46.833
Did you see me drink it?
-I don't care.

45:46.908 --> 45:48.842
I'm being real nice right now.

45:49.410 --> 45:52.277
Don't touch my apple juice,
or there will be repercussions.

45:52.347 --> 45:55.441
You know what? Repercussion, my nuts.
- Grow some.

45:55.516 --> 45:57.450
You hear that?

46:02.857 --> 46:04.222
Barbershop.

46:07.228 --> 46:08.525
Terri, it's Kevin.

46:09.063 --> 46:10.325
I'm not here.

46:10.398 --> 46:12.298
What?
- I'm not here.

46:12.633 --> 46:14.294
I know you heard that.

46:15.103 --> 46:16.434
All right.

46:17.705 --> 46:20.538
Let's kill all this applause, now,
because we all know...

46:20.608 --> 46:23.771
that she's gonna go right back to him
just like she always do.

46:23.845 --> 46:26.336
Don't make me run these
clippers up your ass.

46:26.414 --> 46:29.110
Might need some help with that.
- She told you.

46:30.752 --> 46:32.242
Terri, you all right?

46:40.261 --> 46:41.728
I should thank you.

46:41.929 --> 46:42.918
For what?

46:42.997 --> 46:46.091
This morning,
I made such a spectacle of myself.

46:47.135 --> 46:48.864
But your words were kind.

46:49.070 --> 46:52.005
I believe they were, "Stay strong, brother."

46:52.340 --> 46:54.968
Something like that.
How much I owe you for this?

46:55.042 --> 46:58.102
For one brief, embarrassing moment,
I chose to give up.

46:58.212 --> 47:00.908
But your words
were just the reminder I needed.

47:01.115 --> 47:03.049
Perhaps insignificant to you...

47:03.117 --> 47:05.278
but sometimes I think...

47:05.353 --> 47:09.881
we are unaware of how the little
things for us can be so huge for others.

47:11.192 --> 47:12.682
Hey, honeybun.

47:12.860 --> 47:15.124
Hey, boo.
- This is just too much. Hi.

47:15.963 --> 47:19.228
It's okay. Take your time. Oh, my boo.

47:20.568 --> 47:22.661
Anyway, I do find it amusing
that the people...

47:22.737 --> 47:25.501
who stole my ATM
will not get any money out of it.

47:25.573 --> 47:27.837
Oh, yeah. You can't break into those things.

47:27.909 --> 47:30.935
'Cause there is no money in it.
It is brand new.

47:31.012 --> 47:33.003
It had not even been loaded yet.

47:33.181 --> 47:35.081
There's no money in it?

47:35.883 --> 47:37.544
That's a trip.
- Yes.

47:38.920 --> 47:41.684
How much I owe you for this?
- No. Put your money away.

47:41.756 --> 47:44.122
You take this. This is for you.

47:45.560 --> 47:46.720
Thanks, man.

47:48.496 --> 47:50.361
So, what you gonna do?

47:50.932 --> 47:55.164
I rebuild.
I fix the store, and I stay right here.

47:56.237 --> 47:58.102
The fight must go on.

47:59.140 --> 48:01.438
Either that, or I go back to India.

48:01.509 --> 48:03.943
India? I thought you were from Pakistan.

48:04.011 --> 48:06.571
Heavens, no.
Who would tell you such a thing?

48:06.647 --> 48:07.671
Jimmy.

48:07.748 --> 48:12.378
No, India. PunJab State.
Northwest side, close to Pakistan, though.

48:12.453 --> 48:14.148
Thanks, man, I appreciate this.

48:14.222 --> 48:15.917
Your words were payment enough.

48:15.990 --> 48:18.185
What else can I have...
- No, that's all you get.

48:18.259 --> 48:20.022
What about those...
- No.

48:21.729 --> 48:25.722
Thanks for the juice, man.
- You're welcome. I'll see you soon.

48:27.541 --> 48:29.702
Fellows, what's up?

48:29.777 --> 48:31.335
Got the shoes.

48:31.412 --> 48:32.902
Hey, Checkers.
- You got them?

48:32.980 --> 48:34.447
You got the shoes.

48:35.282 --> 48:37.307
I'll show you how to play.

48:40.254 --> 48:42.484
I'll show you how to play some hardball!

48:42.556 --> 48:44.251
Y'all, look at this lady.

48:44.325 --> 48:46.657
Give it up!
- Now you're talking!

48:47.294 --> 48:50.092
Come over here. You got to see this.
You're missing it!

48:50.164 --> 48:52.894
Somebody out there doing somebody's car?

48:53.033 --> 48:54.466
Damn!

48:54.568 --> 48:57.560
She wanna be real, crack that windshield!
That's what I'd do!

48:57.638 --> 49:01.039
I'll get you good!
I'm gonna get you real good!

49:02.876 --> 49:05.868
Man, what kind of car is it?
- Toyota Camry.

49:07.214 --> 49:10.377
Wait, that's a good car.
I got one of them. I just bought one.

49:10.451 --> 49:11.440
Sick!

49:11.518 --> 49:12.883
What color is it?

49:13.120 --> 49:14.178
Silver.

49:14.254 --> 49:15.881
Pimp! Player!

49:16.357 --> 49:17.619
That's a good color.

49:17.691 --> 49:21.422
It got a chrome rocker panel?

49:26.600 --> 49:28.090
That's my car!

49:30.671 --> 49:34.664
What the hell you doing? That's my car!
Stop hitting on my car!

49:34.742 --> 49:36.369
This is Malcolm Brown's car.

49:36.443 --> 49:38.673
Put the bat down!
I don't know Bobby Brown!

49:38.746 --> 49:41.010
Leave my car alone! Stop hitting my car!

49:41.081 --> 49:43.311
Stop it! Put the bat down!

49:43.384 --> 49:46.683
This ain't Malcolm Brown car?
- This ain't no Malcolm Brown.

49:47.254 --> 49:48.312
I just bought it!

49:48.389 --> 49:50.186
It look like Malcolm Brown car.

49:50.257 --> 49:53.158
Lady, I don't care what it look like!
It's my car.

49:53.927 --> 49:56.088
Wait a minute. This ain't Malcolm's car?

49:56.163 --> 49:58.131
Fuck! Who the hell is Malcolm Brown?

49:58.198 --> 50:01.224
Damn. Well, my bad.

50:01.769 --> 50:03.703
Your what? What you say?

50:03.904 --> 50:04.893
Your bad?

50:06.673 --> 50:09.073
I hope I never make a woman that angry.

50:12.112 --> 50:13.204
Hey, Ricky.

50:14.448 --> 50:15.506
What's up?

50:17.818 --> 50:19.911
I'm feeling to go get some fish.

50:20.454 --> 50:21.648
So, Ricky...

50:21.955 --> 50:26.688
what advice can you offer a guy like me
on the art of wooing women?

50:26.860 --> 50:27.986
On what?

50:28.295 --> 50:30.490
You know, getting the hookup...

50:30.564 --> 50:35.160
the digits, the skins, ill nana,
snappy nappy, oochie wallie?

50:36.036 --> 50:37.560
Yo, just be yourself.

50:38.605 --> 50:42.166
I'm big-boned, Rick, hefty, rotund.

50:42.309 --> 50:44.470
There's too much of myself to go around.

50:44.545 --> 50:47.207
Hold it. There's plenty of fat brothers
pulling good ass.

50:47.281 --> 50:50.148
Look at Biggie, Heavy D.

50:50.217 --> 50:52.708
They were world-famous rappers.

50:53.520 --> 50:57.513
I, on the other hand,
am an overweight barber from West Africa...

50:57.758 --> 50:59.749
with a fondness for poetry.

51:00.194 --> 51:03.391
Attitude will put you on. Confidence.

51:03.764 --> 51:04.753
Okay.

51:05.132 --> 51:09.660
She got to know that, at a moment's notice,
you know, you will not hesitate...

51:09.736 --> 51:12.102
to put the pimp hand down
on Jesus himself...

51:12.172 --> 51:15.073
if he ever made the mistake of
disrespecting her.

51:17.311 --> 51:20.371
How you think Captain Kirk
got all that booty?

51:26.153 --> 51:27.245
Yes!

51:28.388 --> 51:30.447
Thank you, brother!

51:30.991 --> 51:32.151
Put me down.

51:37.030 --> 51:39.055
Hey, Calvin.
- What's up man?

51:39.299 --> 51:40.664
Got them shoes!

51:41.568 --> 51:43.399
I was just looking at these!

52:03.357 --> 52:05.450
How are you doing, Mr. Wallace?

52:05.959 --> 52:07.256
This is Calvin.

52:07.828 --> 52:11.127
You think it'd be all right
if I come through there and talk to you?

52:12.566 --> 52:15.899
First thing I'm gonna do, get a tattoo.

52:16.136 --> 52:19.003
Say, "Thug Nasty, Nasty Thug."

52:21.208 --> 52:25.611
Matter of fact, I'm going to get myself
a Bentley with some 20s on it.

52:25.679 --> 52:27.943
That's what I'm going to do. Thanks to you.

52:31.485 --> 52:33.476
I'm going to get some 25s.

52:33.720 --> 52:37.019
And you the reason why.
That's what I'm going to do.

52:39.359 --> 52:43.762
You wanna act like you ain't giving it up,
but I'm going to get that, just like I got you.

52:43.830 --> 52:45.991
And you better have my money.

52:49.870 --> 52:51.497
Oh, no!

53:00.814 --> 53:02.042
Help me!

53:04.251 --> 53:05.718
Somebody help me!

53:05.786 --> 53:08.414
Damn! Open this door!

53:08.722 --> 53:11.486
Who is it?
- It's the manager! Open this door!

53:11.658 --> 53:14.024
What's going on up in there?
- Nothing.

53:14.094 --> 53:16.961
What you mean, nothing?
What the hell is that smell?

53:17.030 --> 53:19.999
I got diarrhea.
- Diarrhea? If you done messed up...

53:20.067 --> 53:22.228
How come you up here like you the police?

53:22.302 --> 53:25.760
If you done messed up this room...
- Ain't nobody messed up your room.

53:25.839 --> 53:27.534
You better open up this door!

53:27.608 --> 53:30.270
Diarrhea, my ass.
I ain't got to worry about you.

53:30.344 --> 53:34.041
Why are your keys Jingling out there?
Come in this room and see what happens.

53:34.114 --> 53:35.581
I'm calling the cops!

53:35.649 --> 53:37.674
Call the cops, then.
- You better...

53:37.751 --> 53:39.685
See how you like it when the cops come.

53:39.753 --> 53:43.052
Wait a minute. I take that back!
Don't do that. Come back!

53:43.257 --> 53:44.246
Damn!

53:45.092 --> 53:47.117
I'm calling the cops on you two!

53:55.869 --> 53:57.131
What the hell?

53:57.204 --> 53:58.364
Put it down.

54:00.340 --> 54:01.705
Watch your toes.

54:08.181 --> 54:10.615
All right, this is what we going to do.

54:10.684 --> 54:12.914
I'm going to take this
to my grandmama's house.

54:12.986 --> 54:15.580
And I want you to see
what the word on the street is.

54:15.656 --> 54:19.057
Just hang out at the barbershop.
You sure you can handle that?

54:19.793 --> 54:22.057
Do I have to draw you a picture?
- No.

54:23.563 --> 54:27.397
But can I go change my drawers first?
Because they sticking to me.

54:27.634 --> 54:28.862
Yeah.
- Thank you.

54:28.935 --> 54:32.302
But when you're at the barbershop,
you keep your mouth shut.

54:33.307 --> 54:36.071
I want you to be inconspicuous.

54:36.476 --> 54:39.104
The Panthers,
you got to give it up to them...

54:39.179 --> 54:41.704
Martin Luther King, Jesse Jackson...

54:41.782 --> 54:44.410
and you got to give it up
to Rosa Parks, period.

54:44.484 --> 54:47.612
Because they was deep,
and they was on the front line in the '60s.

54:47.688 --> 54:50.418
Who the hell is Rosa Parks?
- Who's Rosa Parks?

54:50.490 --> 54:53.357
She's only the founder of
the modern civil rights movement.

54:53.427 --> 54:57.056
'Cause she sat her ass down on the bus?
- Come on, you know who she is.

54:57.130 --> 54:58.529
Man, she was tired.

54:58.598 --> 55:01.362
That's what you do when you tired.
You sit your ass down.

55:01.435 --> 55:05.462
I sat on a bus and got thrown in Jail,
and ain't hear from nobody in a whole week.

55:05.539 --> 55:07.837
Laptops, computers, ceiling cleaners.

55:07.908 --> 55:09.808
I done told you twice.
- Come on.

55:09.876 --> 55:12.606
You know what?
He need to hear this. You sit down.

55:12.679 --> 55:14.874
You sit down. You need to hear this, too.

55:14.948 --> 55:16.347
Sit down, Rayford.

55:17.517 --> 55:20.748
I probably wouldn't say this
in front of white folk.

55:20.821 --> 55:22.914
But in front of y'all, I'll speak my mind.

55:22.989 --> 55:26.083
Rosa Parks ain't do nothing...

55:26.159 --> 55:28.787
but sit her black ass down.

55:28.862 --> 55:31.023
No, Eddie, you're wrong.

55:31.131 --> 55:34.259
Hold on, now, Seinfeld.

55:34.334 --> 55:35.733
You might learn something now.

55:35.802 --> 55:38.965
I'm gonna give her just due
for what she did.

55:39.039 --> 55:41.439
Her act led to the movement
and everything...

55:41.508 --> 55:43.942
but she damn sure ain't special.

55:44.010 --> 55:48.071
It was a whole lot of black folk
sat down on buses...

55:48.148 --> 55:52.676
and they got thrown in Jail,
and they did it way before Rosa did!

55:52.753 --> 55:55.017
Only difference between them and her...

55:55.088 --> 55:58.148
is that she was a secretary
at the NAACCP...

55:58.258 --> 56:02.422
and she know Martin Luther King,
and they got a lot of publicity.

56:02.629 --> 56:05.530
To me it sound like you got
a little haterism in your game.

56:05.599 --> 56:10.127
Like hell! This ain't no hateration,
or no holleration in this dancery, okay?

56:10.203 --> 56:14.867
What I'm saying is,
is that black people need to stop lying.

56:15.575 --> 56:19.272
There's three things that
black people need to tell the truth about.

56:19.446 --> 56:22.244
One, Rodney King
should have got his ass beat...

56:22.315 --> 56:25.307
for driving drunk
and being pulled over in a Hyundai.

56:25.385 --> 56:27.444
Two, O.J. did it.

56:27.521 --> 56:29.921
O.J. did it? Oh, man!

56:29.990 --> 56:33.585
And three, Rosa Parks ain't do nothing
but sit her black ass down.

56:34.027 --> 56:35.756
That's right! I said it!

56:37.597 --> 56:41.192
I'm going to back you up on that,
'cause he was on the bus back in the day.

56:41.268 --> 56:42.860
And he on the bus now.

56:43.336 --> 56:45.861
Not only is what you're saying not true...

56:46.006 --> 56:49.999
it's wrong and disrespectful
for you to discuss Rosa Parks in that way.

56:50.110 --> 56:51.702
Wait. Hold on here.

56:51.778 --> 56:54.770
Is this a barbershop?
- Yes, it is.

56:55.916 --> 56:58.578
I mean, if we can't talk
straight in a barbershop...

56:58.652 --> 57:01.052
then where can we talk straight?
Nowhere else.

57:01.121 --> 57:04.613
You know, this ain't nothing but
healthy conversation. That's all.

57:04.691 --> 57:06.181
Tearing Rosa Parks down?

57:06.259 --> 57:09.194
There ain't nobody exempt in a barbershop!
You know that.

57:09.262 --> 57:13.494
You can talk about whoever and whatever,
whenever you want to in a barbershop.

57:13.967 --> 57:15.832
You know you wrong, keep on walking.

57:15.902 --> 57:19.463
You're walking by yourself.
I ain't with you. I'll tell you one thing.

57:19.539 --> 57:23.134
You better not never let Jesse Jackson
hear you talking like that.

57:24.878 --> 57:26.641
Man, fuck Jesse Jackson!

57:32.419 --> 57:36.014
Jesse, Randy, Tito, Freddie, Action,
I'll take them all on!

57:37.190 --> 57:38.623
That's what I got to say!

57:38.692 --> 57:40.717
Man, I love this place.

57:40.894 --> 57:43.124
To make that paper,
you see what I'm saying?

57:43.196 --> 57:45.255
Man, you got to have it with you.

57:45.332 --> 57:47.766
What's up, man? Where you going?

57:47.868 --> 57:51.065
You can't just walk past me
like you don't see me.

57:51.738 --> 57:53.433
I'm talking to you, dog!

57:53.507 --> 57:57.466
You can't just walk past me like that.
What, you Magic Juan or something?

57:58.345 --> 58:00.677
Is Mr. Wallace in there?
- He here.

58:00.981 --> 58:02.972
I lead. You follow.

58:05.218 --> 58:06.617
Okay, lead.

58:07.854 --> 58:10.345
Two steps, motherfucker, two steps.

58:11.057 --> 58:12.285
You know, Calvin...

58:13.360 --> 58:18.127
I have never come across anybody
just wanting to give me my money back.

58:19.432 --> 58:21.161
The whole thing, frankly...

58:22.168 --> 58:23.965
vexes me, to be honest.

58:24.204 --> 58:29.164
I swear to God, I'm not trying to vex you.
I don't even know what that mean.

58:29.242 --> 58:32.211
All I'm saying is,
I done had a change of heart.

58:32.279 --> 58:34.611
I had all day to think about it.

58:36.016 --> 58:39.850
If I'm going to lose my shop,
I just don't want to lose it this way.

58:39.920 --> 58:41.581
Which way is that?

58:46.026 --> 58:50.360
My money ain't good enough for you?
I'm just some old street doo-doo, is that it?

58:50.430 --> 58:53.058
You walk your black ass
into some white man's bank...

58:53.133 --> 58:56.660
and you'll find out
that I'm the only friend you got.

58:58.939 --> 59:01.965
On the subJect of the money
I gave you this morning...

59:02.108 --> 59:05.600
the money is yours, the shop is mine.

59:08.548 --> 59:12.712
But I'd be willing to call off the whole deal...

59:14.120 --> 59:17.055
if you were to get me my money by, say...

59:18.158 --> 59:19.386
7:00.

59:21.728 --> 59:25.858
No problem. I could do better than that.
Give it to you right now.

59:30.904 --> 59:31.962
$40,000.

59:33.940 --> 59:36.067
But you only gave me $20,000.

59:37.143 --> 59:38.474
That's double.

59:40.013 --> 59:42.846
You expect me to pay you double by 7:00?

59:44.317 --> 59:46.012
Come on, Mr. Wallace.

59:46.219 --> 59:47.743
Get out of my office.

59:54.594 --> 59:58.155
Here go your money back.
I'm putting it right here on the table for you.

59:58.231 --> 01:00:01.200
I'm sorry about any misunderstanding, or...

01:00:01.534 --> 01:00:04.992
if I led you on in any kind of way,
I'm sorry...

01:00:05.071 --> 01:00:07.596
but I can't sell my shop to you.

01:00:18.818 --> 01:00:20.843
You forgot something.
- That's not mine.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:23.821
What you mean?
- I don't want it. You keep it.

01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:26.916
You going to take this money.
How you gonna renege?

01:00:26.993 --> 01:00:28.153
You keep it!

01:00:30.764 --> 01:00:32.493
No, man, you keep it!

01:00:32.565 --> 01:00:34.362
You forgot something!

01:00:35.101 --> 01:00:38.662
Take this money!
- I don't want it!

01:00:39.072 --> 01:00:42.098
Do I look like Barry Sanders?
Do I look like Lawrence Taylor?

01:00:42.175 --> 01:00:45.110
I don't want it!
- Shut up! I got a Job to do!

01:00:45.178 --> 01:00:47.339
And you ain't allowing me to do it.

01:00:47.447 --> 01:00:48.846
Come on. Hold on.

01:00:53.486 --> 01:00:54.578
Damn!

01:01:00.393 --> 01:01:04.659
What the hell is wrong with you?
Got me running all over the goddamn place.

01:01:06.266 --> 01:01:09.497
This money's yours. You hear me?

01:01:10.537 --> 01:01:11.526
Yeah.

01:01:21.815 --> 01:01:23.214
My grandmama home.

01:01:23.883 --> 01:01:26.647
Girl, you got a great future behind you.

01:01:32.325 --> 01:01:34.020
Oh, shit!

01:01:58.785 --> 01:02:00.047
What the fuck?

01:02:11.664 --> 01:02:13.791
What the hell am I gonna do?

01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:25.172
6-0-5....

01:02:26.246 --> 01:02:30.182
613, we've got a 10-1 at 81st and Corrigan.

01:02:32.552 --> 01:02:34.850
That's us, man. Come on, we got to go.

01:02:34.921 --> 01:02:36.786
Forget about the cash.

01:02:37.056 --> 01:02:39.081
You got to buy lunch.
I don't have any money.

01:02:39.159 --> 01:02:40.387
Let's go.

01:02:57.677 --> 01:02:59.406
The machine broke, y'all!

01:03:02.015 --> 01:03:03.846
I said, the machine broke!

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:18.160
Wait, I'm sorry I messed up
your flowers and everything.

01:03:19.332 --> 01:03:20.924
They were real pretty.

01:03:23.603 --> 01:03:24.968
You talking to me?

01:03:25.038 --> 01:03:27.336
You the only one standing here, right?

01:03:27.607 --> 01:03:30.371
Yes, this is true.

01:03:31.945 --> 01:03:33.572
And the card...

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:37.213
what it said, it was pretty, too.

01:03:38.151 --> 01:03:40.119
You wrote that yourself?

01:03:40.286 --> 01:03:41.344
No.

01:03:42.188 --> 01:03:44.884
Actually, that's a love poem...

01:03:45.525 --> 01:03:47.789
by a man named Pablo Neruda.

01:03:49.963 --> 01:03:51.487
He knows what to say.

01:03:54.534 --> 01:03:56.559
Got me feeling all gentle.

01:04:40.847 --> 01:04:44.647
So, Terri,
I know you have a boyfriend and everything.

01:04:45.518 --> 01:04:48.351
But, you know...

01:04:49.055 --> 01:04:50.682
I was wondering...

01:04:50.757 --> 01:04:53.817
maybe we could, you...
- Kevin.

01:04:54.527 --> 01:04:55.687
Brother K.

01:04:59.132 --> 01:05:01.623
Hey, baby. Excuse me, brother.

01:05:05.538 --> 01:05:07.199
These are for you.

01:05:09.509 --> 01:05:10.874
We need to talk.

01:05:11.077 --> 01:05:12.704
Hold on a second, baby.

01:05:12.845 --> 01:05:15.541
Super-Size-Me Mandela,
you wanna get up off my neck?

01:05:15.615 --> 01:05:17.173
Hold on a second, baby.

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:19.411
What, you don't understand English?

01:05:20.787 --> 01:05:21.879
Stop.

01:05:23.089 --> 01:05:24.613
Be gone, Mandingo.
- Kevin.

01:05:24.691 --> 01:05:26.318
I'm talking to my lady.

01:05:28.728 --> 01:05:31.322
Can you believe Shaka-Zulu?
- Listen!

01:05:31.931 --> 01:05:33.728
I need to say something.

01:05:35.101 --> 01:05:38.662
All right, I don't know exactly
what I'm trying to say, but...

01:05:39.205 --> 01:05:41.070
I love you.
- Bullshit.

01:05:41.374 --> 01:05:42.864
You know that.

01:05:44.143 --> 01:05:46.475
Everybody up in here knows this.

01:05:46.746 --> 01:05:50.978
So look, why don't we just go outside...

01:05:53.553 --> 01:05:55.282
talk about this?

01:05:56.389 --> 01:05:57.413
Come on.

01:06:07.734 --> 01:06:08.792
No.

01:06:09.202 --> 01:06:11.033
I can't do this no more.
- Do what?

01:06:11.104 --> 01:06:13.197
This. Us. This game.

01:06:13.272 --> 01:06:14.864
I ain't playing games, baby.

01:06:14.941 --> 01:06:16.670
Let's just move on.

01:06:17.276 --> 01:06:20.074
So, what, you just gonna break up with me?

01:06:22.815 --> 01:06:24.612
You're breaking up with me?

01:06:25.318 --> 01:06:27.479
I mean, come on, baby. Look at you.

01:06:27.687 --> 01:06:30.212
You ain't even all that fine.
You just average.

01:06:30.289 --> 01:06:32.416
I didn't mind 'cause you was good in bed.

01:06:32.492 --> 01:06:35.017
You do that thing. But I can find better.

01:06:36.696 --> 01:06:38.960
I didn't mean that. See, I want you.

01:06:43.636 --> 01:06:44.728
You are...

01:06:46.039 --> 01:06:47.097
sorry.

01:06:47.173 --> 01:06:49.038
You're so sorry.

01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:52.100
Leave. Get out.

01:06:52.378 --> 01:06:54.471
Don't put your finger in my...
- Leave.

01:06:54.547 --> 01:06:57.141
I do want...
- Out! Clown!

01:07:04.357 --> 01:07:06.154
Gonna get my blade.

01:07:09.962 --> 01:07:11.793
Cut me somebody up in here.

01:07:15.501 --> 01:07:17.230
That's a safari punch!

01:07:19.505 --> 01:07:20.995
Get him on out of here.

01:07:21.074 --> 01:07:23.804
I'm gonna call your mom
and tell her what happened!

01:07:23.876 --> 01:07:25.605
Dinka, boma ye!

01:07:27.346 --> 01:07:29.337
Fool almost messed up my part.

01:08:01.747 --> 01:08:03.146
Damn!

01:08:13.659 --> 01:08:15.524
Ray-Ray?
- It's me.

01:08:15.595 --> 01:08:19.292
They said you was working in the street.
I didn't know you was cleaning them!

01:08:19.365 --> 01:08:21.265
What you got?
- Nothing.

01:08:21.567 --> 01:08:23.558
Do you and nothing need a ride?
- Yeah.

01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:25.995
Bring that nothing on. Come on.

01:08:30.576 --> 01:08:33.443
Can you see all right?
I'll watch out on this side.

01:08:33.813 --> 01:08:35.109
Just right around the corner.

01:08:36.582 --> 01:08:39.210
Thanks.
- Okay, you take care, now.

01:08:39.285 --> 01:08:41.947
Good to have you here in Chicago.
Welcome to the Bulls.

01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:44.113
Michael who?

01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:46.453
See you on Sports Center.
- See y'all soon.

01:08:46.526 --> 01:08:49.323
If he can't be the best,
he can go to hell, too.

01:08:50.529 --> 01:08:52.122
They're going be good.

01:08:54.634 --> 01:08:56.658
What the hell is you looking at?

01:08:56.935 --> 01:08:58.163
I'm curious, man.

01:08:58.237 --> 01:09:01.035
I've been getting my hair cut here
since I was a kid.

01:09:01.107 --> 01:09:03.575
And I ain't never seen nobody in your chair.

01:09:03.643 --> 01:09:06.612
I got plenty of customers.
You just come on the wrong day.

01:09:06.679 --> 01:09:09.671
That's Monday to Saturday,
except Sunday, when we're closed.

01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:11.273
Don't worry, Booker T.

01:09:11.817 --> 01:09:15.344
You think you could hook me up
like lverson? 'Cause that's my dog.

01:09:15.421 --> 01:09:17.479
Fade away, boo-yah!

01:09:17.857 --> 01:09:20.917
What you laughing at?
- Don't hate on me 'cause you a sellout.

01:09:20.993 --> 01:09:23.426
I didn't hear that.
- You heard me, "Bourgie" Banton.

01:09:23.496 --> 01:09:26.555
You got the black girlfriend,
the ride, and I'm a sell-out?

01:09:26.631 --> 01:09:29.395
You're nothing but a minstrel show
turned on its ear.

01:09:29.468 --> 01:09:33.063
Al Jolson in a FUBU hat.
Blackface for the new millennium.

01:09:33.139 --> 01:09:36.973
You think you could hook me up with
your black girlfriend, white girlfriends...

01:09:37.042 --> 01:09:39.978
With your higher education,
how come you only talk about me?

01:09:40.046 --> 01:09:43.482
'Cause you don't belong here.
The white barbershop is uptown.

01:09:43.582 --> 01:09:46.746
You know what l think?
You wish you were me.

01:09:46.986 --> 01:09:50.113
You wish you had my fly-ass girlfriend
and my pimped-out ride.

01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:53.852
Man, you even wish you had my clothes,
my style, my walk.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:58.590
Why you think my fly-ass girl ain't with you?
'Cause your little bitch ass can't compete.

01:09:58.664 --> 01:10:01.997
I got news for you, white boy.
You're not black.

01:10:02.068 --> 01:10:06.368
I'm blacker than you, and in your best day,
you could never be me.

01:10:07.506 --> 01:10:10.304
-You gonna take that?
-Turn it up like this.

01:10:23.222 --> 01:10:25.087
Come on! What you got on me?

01:11:19.512 --> 01:11:21.537
Come on, what you gonna give me for it?

01:11:21.614 --> 01:11:23.741
Man, that piece of Junk barely run.

01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:25.039
It run.

01:11:25.651 --> 01:11:29.451
It's the hottest thing on the street.
All the youngsters asking me about it.

01:11:29.522 --> 01:11:30.819
Cutlass Sierra?

01:11:31.023 --> 01:11:35.221
All it need is a little paint and a tune-up,
'cause it backfires just about that much.

01:11:35.294 --> 01:11:38.593
A little? Man, every time you go home,
I think I'm in a drive-by.

01:11:38.664 --> 01:11:42.327
I can't put that on my lot, man.
I got a reputation to think about.

01:11:44.170 --> 01:11:45.159
Understand?

01:11:46.005 --> 01:11:47.632
No, I don't understand.

01:11:48.974 --> 01:11:49.941
Lunch?

01:11:51.844 --> 01:11:53.106
Thanks.

01:11:53.245 --> 01:11:54.906
I got that plate number.

01:11:56.449 --> 01:12:01.011
Also, there were a bunch of people lined up
at an ATM outside Poppy's Liquor Mart.

01:12:01.087 --> 01:12:02.076
So?

01:12:02.154 --> 01:12:04.554
It just showed up, and then it was gone.

01:12:06.058 --> 01:12:08.026
Let's go. Come on.

01:12:08.294 --> 01:12:11.195
I heard, on BET,
we supposed to make some money.

01:12:11.530 --> 01:12:14.727
Black people supposed to be
getting some money called reparations.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.734
Everybody here
would love to get a handout.

01:12:16.802 --> 01:12:20.533
lf they handing it out,
I won't turn down nothing but my collar.

01:12:22.007 --> 01:12:25.067
Not everybody think
reparations is a good idea, dog.

01:12:25.144 --> 01:12:26.441
It's stupid.

01:12:26.512 --> 01:12:27.979
I'm surprised to hear that.

01:12:28.047 --> 01:12:31.346
I figured you'd make a case
for how slavery got y'all oppressed...

01:12:31.417 --> 01:12:33.749
how the white man
got his foot on your neck.

01:12:33.819 --> 01:12:36.413
Giving out money wouldn't do nothing.
Look at Hammer.

01:12:36.489 --> 01:12:39.458
That boy ain't doing nothing
but infomercials for bad credit.

01:12:39.525 --> 01:12:41.288
Slavery, it ruined my whole life.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:44.022
I don't know what y'all say,
I ain't taking reparations.

01:12:44.096 --> 01:12:46.860
As a black man,
I got my pride and my dignity.

01:12:47.533 --> 01:12:50.195
That's bull. You know why?
Because you got bills.

01:12:50.269 --> 01:12:52.499
Your brothers ain't letting no money get by.

01:12:52.571 --> 01:12:54.801
Next, you'll talk about
how Jews got money...

01:12:54.874 --> 01:12:58.037
Jews didn't get money,
the Holocaust survivors got the money.

01:12:58.110 --> 01:13:00.806
Look, we had welfare and affirmative action.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:04.008
Is that not respirations?
Is that respirations?

01:13:04.083 --> 01:13:05.846
That is respiration.

01:13:10.623 --> 01:13:11.715
Shit!

01:13:22.701 --> 01:13:26.228
Well I think every black person should
at least get $100,000.

01:13:26.305 --> 01:13:28.205
What do you think that's gonna do?

01:13:28.274 --> 01:13:33.007
That won't do nothing but make Cadillac
number-one dealership in the country.

01:13:41.153 --> 01:13:45.112
Everywhere you look, there's opportunity.
You know what I mean?

01:13:45.191 --> 01:13:48.024
I had this opportunity to get
this Job last month.

01:13:48.894 --> 01:13:51.692
This crack-ass cracker
going to tell me I need a diploma.

01:13:51.764 --> 01:13:55.097
Now, right there, that's racism,
that's classism, that's eroticism.

01:13:55.167 --> 01:13:57.692
Man, come on,
I'm talking 'bout "isms" up and...

01:13:57.770 --> 01:14:00.534
We don't need reparations.
All right? We need restraint.

01:14:00.606 --> 01:14:01.937
Restraint?
- Restraint.

01:14:02.007 --> 01:14:03.497
Some discipline.
- Whatever.

01:14:03.576 --> 01:14:06.773
Don't go out and buy a Range Rover
when you living with your mama.

01:14:06.846 --> 01:14:08.404
And pay your mama some rent.

01:14:09.048 --> 01:14:13.883
And can we please try and teach our kids
something other than a Chronic album?

01:14:13.953 --> 01:14:16.080
And, please, black people, be on time...

01:14:16.155 --> 01:14:19.022
for something other than
"free before 11:00" at the club.

01:14:19.091 --> 01:14:20.490
Drink to that, baby.

01:14:20.559 --> 01:14:25.189
You know what? That was a passionate
and surprisingly well-articulated argument.

01:14:25.264 --> 01:14:27.289
You mocking me?
- Not at all, sir.

01:14:27.366 --> 01:14:29.891
I'm actually.... I applaud your virtuosity.

01:14:29.969 --> 01:14:32.199
You know what, schoolboy?
For your information...

01:14:32.271 --> 01:14:34.239
a scallop is a shellfish.

01:14:34.306 --> 01:14:35.864
No, I'm afraid it isn't.

01:14:35.941 --> 01:14:37.465
No, I'm afraid it is.

01:14:37.877 --> 01:14:39.310
Because it's a mollusk.

01:14:39.378 --> 01:14:41.346
Before it comes to your dinner plate...

01:14:41.413 --> 01:14:44.644
it got two shells wrapped around it,
just like a clam.

01:14:46.252 --> 01:14:47.241
Stupid.

01:14:47.386 --> 01:14:48.785
College boy.

01:14:51.557 --> 01:14:52.785
Hey, Grandma.

01:14:53.259 --> 01:14:54.692
It's me, J.D.

01:14:54.827 --> 01:14:57.125
Thelma's son. Your grandson!

01:14:57.796 --> 01:14:59.161
J.D.

01:14:59.231 --> 01:15:00.528
Grandma.

01:15:01.534 --> 01:15:03.502
Nigga never come to see me.

01:15:03.602 --> 01:15:07.094
Grandma, did you say something?
- Grandma don't see or hear too good.

01:15:07.172 --> 01:15:09.538
Okay.
- You want something to eat, baby?

01:15:09.608 --> 01:15:12.941
No, that's okay, Grandma.
I'm going be out back at the tool shed.

01:15:13.012 --> 01:15:15.173
All right. I'll see you in.

01:15:26.592 --> 01:15:27.889
Oh, yeah.

01:15:30.729 --> 01:15:32.890
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

01:15:37.102 --> 01:15:40.265
Get this phone from me, two for one.
- The last one didn't work.

01:15:40.339 --> 01:15:43.831
Listen to me, baby, check it out.
- Ray! What you doing?

01:15:43.909 --> 01:15:45.467
Selling my phones, man.

01:15:45.544 --> 01:15:48.411
How many times I told you
not to come in here soliciting?

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:50.971
Come on, man, Cal,
I'm just selling my phones, man.

01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:54.213
What's wrong with you? Are you retarded?
- What's up man?

01:15:54.286 --> 01:15:56.413
Are you stupid, simple or slow?
Which one?

01:15:56.488 --> 01:15:57.477
None of that.

01:15:57.556 --> 01:16:00.218
You come back in here.
I'm going to call the police.

01:16:00.292 --> 01:16:02.556
Hold up. What you mean, call the police?

01:16:02.628 --> 01:16:05.392
How you going do that to me?
I been coming here for years.

01:16:05.464 --> 01:16:07.022
Everything you needed I got for you.

01:16:07.099 --> 01:16:09.829
When the air conditioner broke,
who brought the Freon? Me.

01:16:09.902 --> 01:16:12.928
What about when Eddie had tax problems?
I got him a new social.

01:16:13.005 --> 01:16:14.302
Not you. Me.

01:16:14.406 --> 01:16:16.306
I'm part of this shop, too, man.

01:16:16.408 --> 01:16:18.672
I don't want to hear that.
- What's up, man?

01:16:18.744 --> 01:16:22.441
Get out of here, man.
- You ain't right, Calvin, you ain't right, man.

01:16:23.215 --> 01:16:25.683
I don't want him back in the shop no more.

01:16:25.751 --> 01:16:27.548
Don't buy nothing from him.

01:16:48.007 --> 01:16:52.205
What was that thing all about in there?
You know that boy don't want no trouble.

01:16:52.277 --> 01:16:54.438
He ain't going to cause
no problem around here.

01:16:54.513 --> 01:16:56.242
I messed up, Eddie.

01:16:57.149 --> 01:16:58.707
I messed up bad.

01:16:58.784 --> 01:17:00.308
Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:17:00.386 --> 01:17:01.751
What did you do?

01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:03.412
Can't get it up?

01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:06.589
The Viagra ain't working for you?

01:17:10.963 --> 01:17:12.555
I lost the shop.

01:17:13.866 --> 01:17:16.460
I actually sold it to Lester Wallace.

01:17:17.069 --> 01:17:20.937
I just realized today
that this was something worth saving.

01:17:23.108 --> 01:17:24.575
Worth saving?

01:17:28.147 --> 01:17:31.878
This ain't no goddamn
school of the blind, Calvin.

01:17:33.585 --> 01:17:35.519
This is the barbershop!

01:17:37.623 --> 01:17:40.023
The place where
a black man means something!

01:17:40.092 --> 01:17:41.923
Cornerstone of neighborhood!

01:17:42.795 --> 01:17:44.660
Our own country club!

01:17:45.564 --> 01:17:47.896
I mean, can't you see that?

01:17:51.537 --> 01:17:52.902
You know...

01:17:55.541 --> 01:17:58.704
that's the problem
with your whole generation.

01:17:58.911 --> 01:18:02.540
You know, you all,
you don't believe in nothing.

01:18:02.881 --> 01:18:05.941
But your father,
he believed in something, Cal.

01:18:07.119 --> 01:18:09.314
He believed and understood...

01:18:09.688 --> 01:18:12.885
that something as simple
as a little haircut...

01:18:13.258 --> 01:18:16.489
could change the way
a man felt on the inside.

01:18:18.664 --> 01:18:20.655
My father died broke...

01:18:21.767 --> 01:18:23.359
and frustrated...

01:18:23.435 --> 01:18:25.903
trying to help everybody
in this damn neighborhood.

01:18:25.971 --> 01:18:27.063
Look!

01:18:27.139 --> 01:18:30.370
Your daddy may not have had
a whole lot of money...

01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:32.902
but he was rich...

01:18:33.011 --> 01:18:35.002
'cause he invested in people.

01:18:35.447 --> 01:18:36.778
Well, what you think?

01:18:36.849 --> 01:18:39.477
You think I'm the only one he gave a Job to?

01:18:41.019 --> 01:18:44.113
No! That man opened up the doors...

01:18:44.189 --> 01:18:48.182
to anybody and any knucklehead
round here in the city of Chicago...

01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:51.388
that wanted to come down here
and make something out they self.

01:18:51.463 --> 01:18:53.397
Gave them the opportunity to be somebody!

01:18:53.465 --> 01:18:55.899
A licensed, professional barber.

01:18:57.803 --> 01:19:01.500
Now, me, myself personally...

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:05.999
I wouldn't have gave
half these bail-Jumpers the opportunity.

01:19:06.578 --> 01:19:10.378
But it just hard enough,
you sitting there trying to cut some head...

01:19:10.449 --> 01:19:13.316
and gotta worry 'bout this fool
trying to shank you.

01:19:13.385 --> 01:19:16.445
But let me tell you something.
At the end of the day....

01:19:17.589 --> 01:19:21.423
At the end of the day, I was glad I was here.

01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:24.857
And now you.

01:19:30.669 --> 01:19:32.000
They know?

01:19:35.607 --> 01:19:36.596
No.

01:19:39.812 --> 01:19:41.939
Well, you gonna have to tell them.

01:19:42.014 --> 01:19:43.641
Don't look at me.

01:20:00.299 --> 01:20:01.288
Yo, Cal.

01:20:03.535 --> 01:20:06.971
You got some nerve bringing your ass
back around here.

01:20:07.639 --> 01:20:09.334
I got the Job.

01:20:09.408 --> 01:20:11.876
Now I can put my little girl in real day care.

01:20:11.944 --> 01:20:16.438
My sister-in-law was keeping her.
She's a crackhead and I can't have that.

01:20:18.183 --> 01:20:19.377
Thanks, Cal.

01:20:19.451 --> 01:20:21.043
Keep the change.

01:20:22.054 --> 01:20:23.385
Yo, Lamar.

01:20:27.559 --> 01:20:29.288
No charge.
- No, no.

01:20:29.361 --> 01:20:32.057
No, Calvin, you keep that, man.
I know you need it.

01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:34.758
Congratulations on your new Job, man.

01:20:35.601 --> 01:20:37.330
Looking good for a change.

01:20:38.503 --> 01:20:40.596
Take it easy.
- Thanks, Cal.

01:20:41.073 --> 01:20:42.165
Good night.

01:20:55.587 --> 01:20:57.487
Come on. Your drop.

01:20:57.556 --> 01:20:59.820
I'm only saying he's a cripple.

01:20:59.892 --> 01:21:03.760
He's not crippled.
He's cute. Tell his mama to set me up.

01:21:03.829 --> 01:21:05.490
Hey, yo, listen up, everybody.

01:21:05.564 --> 01:21:06.724
What?
- All right.

01:21:06.798 --> 01:21:08.561
Hold on, listen. Yo, Fred.

01:21:08.634 --> 01:21:10.829
Listen up.

01:21:12.504 --> 01:21:16.668
I just want to say
from the bottom of my heart, that...

01:21:18.377 --> 01:21:20.311
I appreciate everybody in here.

01:21:20.379 --> 01:21:23.280
We appreciate you having us, Calvin.
- I'm serious.

01:21:23.348 --> 01:21:25.782
Now hold up, I'm serious.
- Give us a raise now.

01:21:25.851 --> 01:21:28.376
I appreciate everything
you guys do for the shop.

01:21:28.453 --> 01:21:32.719
I know some of the customers
don't leave tips like they supposed to.

01:21:32.891 --> 01:21:37.453
And if I had the money,
I'd tip you guys myself.

01:21:37.562 --> 01:21:39.587
Big C, what's wrong, dude?

01:21:42.701 --> 01:21:44.601
We're gonna be closing up the shop today.

01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:46.535
What?
- Why, Calvin?

01:21:46.605 --> 01:21:49.165
You mean closing early?
- What you mean by "today"?

01:21:49.241 --> 01:21:50.708
We only got about a hour.

01:21:50.776 --> 01:21:52.471
You guys are not hearing me.

01:21:52.544 --> 01:21:55.741
When I took this shop over two years ago,
I didn't know what I had.

01:21:56.848 --> 01:21:59.373
I was young. I didn't know.

01:21:59.451 --> 01:22:01.544
Hold tight, man. What you trying to say?

01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:03.485
Eddie, what you doing, man?

01:22:04.957 --> 01:22:06.857
What's going on?

01:22:08.694 --> 01:22:10.161
I sold the shop.

01:22:10.228 --> 01:22:11.217
You what?

01:22:11.296 --> 01:22:13.856
You sold the shop?
- You don't own the shop no more?

01:22:13.932 --> 01:22:16.958
I don't understand.
- He said he sold the shop, Dinka.

01:22:17.035 --> 01:22:19.868
This is your shop, man.
Your family built this shop.

01:22:19.938 --> 01:22:22.873
Can't nobody run this shop like you, boy.
- For real, man.

01:22:24.209 --> 01:22:26.109
Why you ain't tell us?

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:30.641
Who are we gonna be working for?

01:22:32.951 --> 01:22:34.976
Like I was saying, that...

01:22:38.256 --> 01:22:40.747
when I close the shop tonight...

01:22:42.661 --> 01:22:43.787
it's closing for good.

01:22:43.862 --> 01:22:46.592
Calvin, please. Calvin, don't do this.

01:22:46.665 --> 01:22:48.656
Eddie, can I talk to you, man? Eddie?

01:22:50.268 --> 01:22:51.667
Hey, Eddie!

01:22:56.408 --> 01:22:58.171
I still don't understand.

01:22:58.243 --> 01:23:00.973
Go home! Just go home. It's over.

01:23:01.947 --> 01:23:04.575
I didn't mean that, man. Just pack up.

01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:06.144
Go home.

01:23:06.752 --> 01:23:09.346
No warning? That's it?

01:23:09.421 --> 01:23:13.687
Let's just be out, man. Let's just be out.
- That's foul, Joe. I'm outta here.

01:23:13.759 --> 01:23:15.920
Cal, you could have told us.

01:23:16.395 --> 01:23:18.659
I don't believe this.
- Why?

01:23:19.431 --> 01:23:20.864
Oh, no!
- Police!

01:23:20.932 --> 01:23:22.092
Nobody move!

01:23:27.973 --> 01:23:29.770
Get him up and get him out.

01:23:30.075 --> 01:23:31.303
Hold on, man!

01:23:32.210 --> 01:23:33.734
Wait a minute! Shut up!

01:23:33.812 --> 01:23:35.746
You just stay right there!

01:23:35.814 --> 01:23:37.338
What did he do?

01:23:38.083 --> 01:23:39.380
Let's go.
- Hey, Rick!

01:23:39.451 --> 01:23:40.918
I ain't do nothing!

01:23:43.422 --> 01:23:45.583
Hey, that ain't even necessary right there!

01:23:45.891 --> 01:23:48.382
Williams, can I talk to you?
That shit ain't necessary!

01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:51.623
Don't worry, I'll get back at you.
Let me get him squared away.

01:23:51.696 --> 01:23:54.961
Rick! Call me soon as
they let you use a phone.

01:24:15.821 --> 01:24:17.311
Hey, what's up, J.D.?

01:24:18.523 --> 01:24:20.423
Where the hell you been, man?

01:24:20.525 --> 01:24:22.356
At the barbershop.
- All day?

01:24:27.065 --> 01:24:28.828
You got a cut.
- Yeah.

01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:32.495
Yeah, man, I wanted to get braided,
but you know Terri, she be tripping.

01:24:32.571 --> 01:24:35.870
Right, who lined you up?
- It was Jimmy who did....

01:24:36.141 --> 01:24:39.338
Come on, man! What you doing?

01:24:39.911 --> 01:24:41.674
Braiding your hair, sucker!

01:24:41.746 --> 01:24:42.735
Stop playing.

01:24:42.814 --> 01:24:45.044
Stop. You better stop playing.

01:24:45.117 --> 01:24:46.744
What you learn at the barbershop?

01:24:46.818 --> 01:24:49.651
Man, I learned a lot, man.
- What about the police, man?

01:24:49.721 --> 01:24:51.780
Man, they know what's up.

01:24:51.857 --> 01:24:54.792
They came up in there, like,
10 deep, man! 20, boom!

01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:57.727
"Get up against the wall!"
- Hold up, man, my foot!

01:24:58.163 --> 01:25:00.529
Man, I'm tellin' you, it was like SWAT.

01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:03.426
You serious?

01:25:03.502 --> 01:25:07.461
Yeah, man. I wouldn't have made it alive
if I hadn't done the shake move...

01:25:07.539 --> 01:25:10.133
and, you know, I crept up outta there.

01:25:12.010 --> 01:25:13.238
Hold on.

01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:16.004
Hello?

01:25:16.081 --> 01:25:18.709
Hey, I got ask you a question.
- Who this?

01:25:18.783 --> 01:25:20.614
Ricky, fat ass, and guess where I'm at.

01:25:21.486 --> 01:25:24.387
What's up, dog?
- It's the last place I'm gonna be for life.

01:25:25.724 --> 01:25:27.487
What you talking about, player?

01:25:27.559 --> 01:25:31.325
I'm taIking about that smash-and-grab
with that ATM the other night.

01:25:31.396 --> 01:25:33.660
The same night you borrowed my truck.

01:25:34.499 --> 01:25:36.729
I been calling you all day about the bumper.

01:25:36.801 --> 01:25:38.826
Now they got photos of the plate.

01:25:38.904 --> 01:25:40.633
And they traced it back to me.

01:25:40.705 --> 01:25:41.797
A two-time loser.

01:25:41.873 --> 01:25:44.899
Ricky, did you just say "two-time loser"?

01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:47.105
As in, your third strike?

01:25:47.179 --> 01:25:48.168
Yeah.

01:25:53.685 --> 01:25:55.380
You're going to Jail for life, player!

01:25:55.453 --> 01:25:58.320
And when you do get out,
I'm going to be long gone!

01:25:58.857 --> 01:26:00.654
Hey, don't drop the soap!

01:26:00.725 --> 01:26:02.693
Come on, player.
- What'd he say, man?

01:26:02.761 --> 01:26:03.785
What we gonna do?

01:26:03.862 --> 01:26:05.853
We going crack this piggy bank
and get paid.

01:26:10.268 --> 01:26:11.963
Man, let me tell you something.

01:26:12.037 --> 01:26:15.404
Just 'cause you go to some fancy college
don't make you better than me.

01:26:15.473 --> 01:26:16.963
Don't make you better than no one.

01:26:17.042 --> 01:26:21.035
I probably won't ever even go to school,
but I'm gonna do something with my life.

01:26:21.112 --> 01:26:24.206
I'm gonna have me a business.
I'm opening up a shop.

01:26:24.482 --> 01:26:26.677
And despite what you may think...

01:26:26.751 --> 01:26:29.515
I ain't pretending
to be someone I saw on TV.

01:26:29.588 --> 01:26:31.215
This is who I am.

01:26:31.923 --> 01:26:35.882
And whether you like it or not,
I'm gonna be like this tomorrow.

01:26:52.110 --> 01:26:54.101
All right, man, let's see it.

01:26:54.179 --> 01:26:55.168
See what?

01:26:55.247 --> 01:26:58.648
You're saying this is who you are.
This is who you'll be, right?

01:26:58.717 --> 01:26:59.945
So, prove it.

01:27:01.019 --> 01:27:02.145
Hook me up.

01:27:07.999 --> 01:27:09.523
All right.

01:28:13.164 --> 01:28:14.426
Okay.

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:16.899
That's not bad.

01:28:20.605 --> 01:28:22.402
Actually, it's pretty good.

01:28:28.279 --> 01:28:32.010
Hey, man, I shouldn't have disrespected
you like that, in front of everybody.

01:28:32.083 --> 01:28:35.575
Nah, it's cool, man. I'm actually kind of
glad you came to your senses.

01:28:35.653 --> 01:28:38.213
Why is that?
- 'Cause I was running outta insults.

01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:47.489
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:29:22.834 --> 01:29:24.062
Thanks, baby.

01:29:32.777 --> 01:29:35.610
So, I guess you can invest
in that studio now.

01:29:42.086 --> 01:29:43.417
Look, Calvin....

01:29:44.455 --> 01:29:46.446
I'll support you. You know that.

01:29:47.625 --> 01:29:49.320
If it's a studio, fine.

01:29:49.727 --> 01:29:53.390
You want to sell used hubcaps,
or I don't know...

01:29:53.464 --> 01:29:56.900
thong underwear, whatever, I'm with you.
You know that.

01:29:57.602 --> 01:29:59.433
Whatever it is you do...

01:30:00.204 --> 01:30:02.604
make it mean something to you.

01:30:03.074 --> 01:30:07.909
And, if it doesn't work out, you know,
you can always just go work for my uncle.

01:30:09.681 --> 01:30:11.546
You know I can't stand your uncle.

01:30:11.616 --> 01:30:15.677
And he can't stand you,
but he'll give you a Job as a favor to me.

01:30:38.810 --> 01:30:40.937
Where are you going?
- Be right back.

01:30:58.963 --> 01:31:00.794
Thanks for bringing my coat.

01:31:04.936 --> 01:31:06.198
I didn't do it.

01:31:06.571 --> 01:31:10.268
If I thought you did it,
I would have never bailed you out.

01:31:11.476 --> 01:31:15.173
And I damn sure wouldn't be
out here freezing my balls off.

01:31:17.381 --> 01:31:18.871
Let's go, man.

01:31:23.321 --> 01:31:26.722
Why'd Williams come get you, man?
- My cousin did this to me.

01:31:26.791 --> 01:31:29.225
Your cousin?
- J.D. did this to me.

01:31:29.594 --> 01:31:31.562
Man, that dude is crazy.

01:31:32.964 --> 01:31:34.261
Don't worry about him no more.

01:31:34.332 --> 01:31:36.766
People like that always get theirs in the end.

01:31:36.834 --> 01:31:39.928
That's right. You know what?
I'm gonna make sure that he get his.

01:31:40.004 --> 01:31:41.301
Don't go there with that.

01:31:41.372 --> 01:31:44.273
What you talking about?
I ain't going let a fool roll over me.

01:31:44.342 --> 01:31:47.402
You've come too far,
did too many things with your life...

01:31:47.478 --> 01:31:50.572
to let him pull you back.
- I ain't having this conversation.

01:31:50.648 --> 01:31:52.639
Just drop me off at 79th.

01:31:52.884 --> 01:31:54.715
You know what? Look.

01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:57.281
Here. ls that what you want?

01:31:57.355 --> 01:31:59.220
That's what I'm talking 'bout.

01:31:59.290 --> 01:32:01.815
Yeah, it came out your....
It dropped out your locker.

01:32:01.893 --> 01:32:04.293
There you go, man.
Go and throw your life away.

01:32:04.362 --> 01:32:08.196
And throw away the bail money,
all the money I put up for you.

01:32:10.968 --> 01:32:14.028
You know what, Cal? Just pull over.

01:32:14.438 --> 01:32:15.530
Pull over?

01:32:15.606 --> 01:32:18.040
Yeah.
- Okay. I'm gonna pull over.

01:32:36.327 --> 01:32:37.851
Now you're using your head.

01:32:37.929 --> 01:32:39.897
Yeah, whatever, man. Where we going?

01:32:39.964 --> 01:32:42.262
We going to see Lester Wallace.

01:32:43.367 --> 01:32:45.301
I'm gonna get my barbershop back.

01:32:45.369 --> 01:32:49.601
You wait till I throw out my gun,
and tell me we going to see Lester?

01:32:50.274 --> 01:32:52.139
Man, we ain't even supposed to be in here.

01:32:52.210 --> 01:32:55.236
I told you I used to work here, player.
- That's "used to," J.D.

01:32:55.313 --> 01:32:57.440
That means I still know
what the hell I'm doing.

01:32:57.515 --> 01:32:59.881
All right? Let me look at this.

01:33:03.988 --> 01:33:05.717
Now, that's a fire!

01:33:05.923 --> 01:33:07.413
Hell.
- Give me that, let me!

01:33:07.491 --> 01:33:10.983
Come on, I got it, dog.
It just went out. I can start it again.

01:33:11.062 --> 01:33:13.929
These used to be my tools, dog.
This used to be my station.

01:33:13.998 --> 01:33:17.934
You can't even click it right.
- Clap your hands and stomp your feet.

01:33:18.002 --> 01:33:19.629
Clap them. Stomp them!

01:33:20.404 --> 01:33:21.632
Look at that!

01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:23.668
Give it to me. Let me.

01:33:23.741 --> 01:33:26.335
Come on! Billy! Give it to me! Billy, get.

01:33:27.511 --> 01:33:28.944
What's your problem?

01:33:29.013 --> 01:33:31.106
Why you always gotta
push somebody, man?

01:33:31.182 --> 01:33:33.013
I'm sick of this!
- You want some of this?

01:33:34.118 --> 01:33:36.086
I don't see Lester's car.

01:33:36.153 --> 01:33:37.552
Hold tight.

01:33:37.622 --> 01:33:40.250
That look like my grandmama truck
right there.

01:33:51.469 --> 01:33:54.632
Wait a minute. Don't open the door.
ls it hers?

01:33:56.841 --> 01:33:58.468
Hey, yo, Rick, hold up!

01:33:58.809 --> 01:34:00.504
Gotta call some backup for us.

01:34:00.578 --> 01:34:01.567
Yeah.

01:34:03.948 --> 01:34:04.937
J.D.!

01:34:05.716 --> 01:34:07.411
No, hey, Rick! No, man!

01:34:07.485 --> 01:34:09.112
Hey! Get back!

01:34:10.821 --> 01:34:12.413
Pretty Ricky! What's up baby?

01:34:12.490 --> 01:34:15.584
How you like your chicken, Ricky?
Original, or extra crispy?

01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:16.854
Bitch!

01:34:20.364 --> 01:34:22.025
What are you doing in my shop?

01:34:22.099 --> 01:34:24.932
What's going on up in here?
- I'm on your team!

01:34:25.002 --> 01:34:28.062
What's going on?
What are you doing in my shop?

01:34:28.606 --> 01:34:30.597
I don't know what they doing here.

01:34:30.675 --> 01:34:34.076
But you know what I'm here for.
I want my shop back.

01:34:34.578 --> 01:34:36.205
You got my money?

01:34:37.281 --> 01:34:38.612
No.
- What?

01:34:38.716 --> 01:34:41.913
I had to use it help my man Ricky
get out of Jail.

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:45.887
But I promise you
that I'll get you all your money back.

01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:48.117
Wait, let me get this right.

01:34:48.392 --> 01:34:52.260
You come in here demanding to get back
a barbershop that you don't have anymore.

01:34:52.330 --> 01:34:54.093
You don't have $40,000 to buy it back...

01:34:54.165 --> 01:34:57.862
and you don't even have
the $20,000 I gave you this morning?

01:34:57.935 --> 01:34:59.266
Monk, this man is crazy.

01:34:59.337 --> 01:35:00.634
Must be crazy, Mr. Wallace.

01:35:00.705 --> 01:35:04.436
I told you, I'll get you your money back,
but only $20,000.

01:35:05.543 --> 01:35:07.773
If you got a problem with that...

01:35:07.845 --> 01:35:11.246
I think Chicago PD might have
a problem with this ATM machine...

01:35:11.315 --> 01:35:15.183
sitting in the middle of your floor,
'cause they been lookin' for it all day.

01:35:15.252 --> 01:35:17.015
What the hell is this?

01:35:17.088 --> 01:35:20.580
Hold tight, Lester,
you got bigger problems than that, dog.

01:35:20.658 --> 01:35:23.149
Like them stolen car parts over there.

01:35:23.227 --> 01:35:26.424
Somebody might mistake
this place for a chop shop.

01:35:28.099 --> 01:35:29.088
Monk!

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:30.895
Courage? What you going do?

01:35:34.438 --> 01:35:36.463
You gonna have to use that on me, big boy.

01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:38.974
It's like I said, I ain't going nowhere.

01:35:39.043 --> 01:35:40.943
I got too much to lose.

01:35:41.479 --> 01:35:44.642
Can't leave here without it.
Simple and plain.

01:35:45.449 --> 01:35:47.815
It's been in my family too long.

01:35:48.819 --> 01:35:50.286
Forty years.

01:35:51.389 --> 01:35:55.257
I can't just let you take it
and turn it into some strip club.

01:35:57.862 --> 01:35:59.523
What you wanna do?

01:36:04.802 --> 01:36:07.293
Put your hands up! Put them up!

01:36:07.605 --> 01:36:09.402
Calvin? Are you all right?

01:36:12.877 --> 01:36:14.174
Am I all right?

01:36:15.312 --> 01:36:16.301
Yeah.

01:36:21.385 --> 01:36:23.182
I'm all right.
- You sure?

01:36:23.254 --> 01:36:24.551
I'm good.

01:36:24.622 --> 01:36:27.090
There go the thugs you want over there.

01:36:27.158 --> 01:36:29.786
Simmons, Fred.
- These dudes are fine.

01:36:31.862 --> 01:36:33.989
Come on man. We found that!

01:36:35.332 --> 01:36:36.697
My dog.

01:36:36.767 --> 01:36:40.225
Don't you ever do that shit again man.
- Are you crazy?

01:36:42.773 --> 01:36:44.263
How did we get out of that?

01:36:44.341 --> 01:36:47.276
He wasn't going shoot nobody.
He had on leather pants.

01:36:47.344 --> 01:36:49.335
Yo, peep this out.
- Yo, what's up?

01:36:49.413 --> 01:36:52.712
You get a reward if you turn this in.
Did you know that?

01:36:52.783 --> 01:36:54.683
Yo! Detective Williams.

01:36:54.752 --> 01:36:56.720
Remember who found this!

01:37:01.792 --> 01:37:04.090
Ain't gonna be around here that long.

01:37:04.161 --> 01:37:07.562
A couple more years, I'm gonna retire,
and I'm gonna move to Arizona.

01:37:07.631 --> 01:37:08.825
It's nice down there.

01:37:08.899 --> 01:37:10.924
Black folks ought to boycott Arizona...

01:37:11.001 --> 01:37:13.333
'cause they didn't
recognize King's birthday.

01:37:13.404 --> 01:37:15.497
Hold up, now, Fred.

01:37:15.573 --> 01:37:18.633
Fred, do not get this fool started
on Martin Luther King!

01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:20.199
No, Calvin, let me tell it.

01:37:20.277 --> 01:37:22.643
Now, Martin Luther King was a hoe!

01:37:22.913 --> 01:37:24.642
No, he was a freak. Yeah.

01:37:24.815 --> 01:37:26.806
He freaking everything and everybody!

01:37:26.884 --> 01:37:31.082
So come King's birthday, I want everybody
to take the day off and get your freak on.

01:37:31.155 --> 01:37:33.453
Watch your mouth, Eddie!

01:37:33.524 --> 01:37:36.823
Look, there are little kids over there.
Let me see them report cards.

01:37:36.894 --> 01:37:39.362
Calvin, you got that candy?
I want a Now and Later!

01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:41.057
No, let me see. Here you go.

01:37:41.132 --> 01:37:44.863
That's you. And that's for you.
Okay? Watch out.

01:38:05.556 --> 01:38:06.545
Hey!

01:38:07.124 --> 01:38:09.615
Look what I've got.
- Excuse me!

01:38:10.561 --> 01:38:13.792
What?
- Who drank my goddamn apple juice?

01:38:15.132 --> 01:38:19.091
Don't "oh" me! Jimmy, I knew it was you!
That's why I spit in it.

01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:32.600
