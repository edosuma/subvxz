Previously on 90210:

00:03.963 --> 00:05.339
This is Kimberly McIntyre.
She's transferring

00:05.464 --> 00:06.757
to West Beverly
starting today.

00:06.882 --> 00:08.300
You guys are
coming tonight, right?

00:08.425 --> 00:10.093
Why does this suddenly
feel like a double-date?

00:10.218 --> 00:11.553
(snorting)

00:11.679 --> 00:13.681
I can help you deal with this,
but you've got to let me.

00:13.806 --> 00:15.641
Your department made
quite the scene today.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.100
We did this now
because then they'll figure

00:17.225 --> 00:18.310
the bust already happened.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.521
Harry, can I talk
to you for a second?
Sure.

00:20.646 --> 00:21.605
It's about our son.

00:21.730 --> 00:24.399
Whoa, whoa, Tracy...

00:24.525 --> 00:27.068
I need you to tell them
that the drugs were yours.
Okay.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.111
If she confesses
it should help.

00:28.236 --> 00:29.446
But you know
there's no guarantees.

00:29.571 --> 00:30.489
Adrianna is
gonna be here.

00:30.614 --> 00:31.615
If you just give her
a few more minutes.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.367
Oh!
(screaming)

00:33.492 --> 00:35.452
NAOMI:
I cannot believe
you did this to me.

00:35.577 --> 00:38.580
We're done, I hope you got that.
You're dead to me.

and she looks just the same.

Yeah, believe me that's
the nicest thing I've thought

01:08.944 --> 01:10.195
since she kissed you.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.197
Well, I-I appreciate
your holding back.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.782
At least in public.

01:13.908 --> 01:14.825
Yeah, yeah,
you're the principal

01:14.950 --> 01:15.993

01:16.117 --> 01:17.703
and she's the head
of the parent board

01:17.828 --> 01:19.454
so I have to be nice.
But I don't like her.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.332
I don't blame you,
but thank you.

away from the curb.

01:37.639 --> 01:38.849
Mm-hmm.
Damn.

01:38.974 --> 01:41.351
Looks like somebody is ready
to get her driver's permit.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.937
Yeah.

01:43.062 --> 01:44.772
HARRY:
Yeah, and if you pass
your test tomorrow

01:44.897 --> 01:45.773
you can drive
your mother and I

01:45.898 --> 01:46.732
to the homecoming dance.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.859
Aw, come on, for real?

01:50.485 --> 01:51.904
Yes, we are chaperoning.

01:54.322 --> 01:55.950
Yes, sir, I'm asking her today.

01:56.075 --> 01:57.868
Got it all planned out already,
you know?

01:57.993 --> 02:00.829
Got the suit,
the shoes, restaurant.

02:00.955 --> 02:01.747
You know how you taught me.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.331
Yeah, yeah.
(laughing)

02:03.457 --> 02:04.875
How about you, honey?
You gonna go to the dance?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.544
Um, yeah, I would have
to be asked first.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.647
And you did share a--
what did you call it?

02:26.772 --> 02:28.899
An "almost" kiss.

to homecoming?

02:47.626 --> 02:48.710
No.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.713
Really? Why?

02:51.839 --> 02:55.092
Because it's everything wrong
with this place in stark relief.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.928
It's like a big popularity
contest set to music.

02:58.053 --> 02:59.554
You don't want
to go, do you?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.765
Oh, nah, nah,
no, no, no, nah.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.143
No! I don't like
that crap.
Yeah.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.854
I thought it was,
you know, stuff girls like.

03:06.979 --> 03:09.606
Um, other girls, maybe.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.442
So, I mean we could go, you
know, and make fun of people

03:12.567 --> 03:13.819
if that's what you want.

03:13.944 --> 03:16.030
Well, I am actually scheduled
to get my wisdom teeth

03:16.155 --> 03:18.323
out tomorrow, so
maybe you could

03:18.448 --> 03:19.783
come over and
make fun of me?

03:19.908 --> 03:21.535
I'm going to have
a big chipmunk face.

but, uh,

03:25.039 --> 03:28.458
maybe that's your way of, uh,
asking me to take care of you.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.335
No, this is.

03:57.029 --> 03:59.489
I'll be there
as a chaperone.

03:59.614 --> 04:02.659
And what are you going to wear?
Something sexy?

04:02.784 --> 04:06.454
You know what, Kimberly,
you're crossing the line.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.831

Okay.

04:58.090 --> 05:00.092
But I'm not going to.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.888
Okay, um, are you
going to take Naomi?

05:05.013 --> 05:07.057
No, no, we were
going to go together,

05:07.182 --> 05:10.102
um, but we're broken up now,
so... which is good,

05:10.227 --> 05:14.106
um, but it just feels
like a little soon.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.899
Not to be going
out with you.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.943
I mean to be going
to homecoming with you.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.402
Does that make any sense?

05:19.527 --> 05:21.905
Oddly, that all
made sense, yes.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.907
But, uh, just 'cause
we're not going together

05:24.032 --> 05:27.327
doesn't mean that we can't
dance together at the dance.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.163
Yes, well, if we're
going to do that then

05:29.288 --> 05:31.331
that would be
the place to do it.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.000

Okay, okay, so
here's the plan.

05:33.125 --> 05:36.586
You show up, then I show up.

05:36.711 --> 05:39.589
Then it'll be
total surprise, like,

05:39.714 --> 05:43.010
"Oh, my God, you're here?
Oh, my God, I'm here, too."

05:43.135 --> 05:45.887
Then...
We dance?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.806
Hmm!
So, I'll see you
at homecoming.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.016

05:49.141 --> 05:51.434

Well, is she okay?
What happened?

06:39.149 --> 06:41.693
EMTs resuscitated her,
they took her to the hospital

and pumped her stomach.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.071
Is she going to be all right?

06:44.196 --> 06:46.531
Yeah, she's going to
be fine, but she was lucky.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.116
And since it's
her first offense

06:48.242 --> 06:50.285
she's going to

06:50.409 --> 06:53.705
As for you, when the police
took her statement,

06:53.830 --> 06:56.083
she said that the drugs
you flushed were hers.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.252
And since it's

So will Naomi be

07:00.837 --> 07:02.756

07:02.881 --> 07:05.675
The police said
we could handle it here.

afternoon detention

07:08.178 --> 07:09.470

before she OD'd.

08:11.574 --> 08:14.119

my boyfriend anymore.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.079
My parents are getting divorced.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.289

what to say, but...

08:56.870 --> 08:58.997
It'll be so much fun,
I promise.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.124
You know what?
That-That does sound like fun.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.250
Good.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.503
Thanks.

09:04.627 --> 09:07.839
ETHAN:
With Naomi? You've got
to be kidding me.

09:07.964 --> 09:08.798
I'm serious.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.051
It was really nice of her.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.178
And I felt bad,
I couldn't say no.

09:13.303 --> 09:14.679
And-And I think it'll be fun.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.264
Okay.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.765
What?

09:17.891 --> 09:21.019
No, it's just weird--
you guys hanging out.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.937
Oh, don't be jealous.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.689
Oh, yeah, that's
what I am.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.107
I'm still going to
dance with you.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.859
Oh, I know you're still
going to dance with me.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.028
'Cause you know,
dancing's like, my thing.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.864
Oh, oh, is it?
Dancing's your thing.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.366
I thought driving
was your thing.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.992
You know, I got
a lot of things.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.911
I'm a very well-rounded
individual, so...

09:38.036 --> 09:39.037
Oh, all right.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.373
(horn honking)
ETHAN:
Yeah, whatever.

09:41.498 --> 09:44.042
Oh, okay, I got to go.
Mom's here.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.419
Uh, yeah, me too.

09:45.544 --> 09:48.296
Uh, got to go
find a new thing, so...

09:54.761 --> 09:55.678
Hi, I'm Naomi Clarke.

09:55.803 --> 09:56.930
Shh.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.058
Sign in, please.

10:03.228 --> 10:06.647
(sighs)

10:09.443 --> 10:11.445
(sighs)

10:21.329 --> 10:23.123
What'd you do to get in here?

10:23.248 --> 10:24.291
You sleep with a teacher?

10:24.416 --> 10:26.042
No, I turned them all down.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.168
Oh, what, they
didn't pay enough?

10:27.294 --> 10:28.295
Not nearly.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.589
What's your deal?

10:30.713 --> 10:33.300
You know, I saw your
big poster out there
in the hallway.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.760
I take it you're probably
going to go to homecoming

10:35.885 --> 10:38.179
with one of the
other big posters.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.265
You know, you one-
dimensional creatures
usually stick together.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.766
It's a good thing.

10:41.891 --> 10:42.976
I'm Ozzie, by the way.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.937
Oh, see now, that's
your first mistake.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.939
Because now that I know
who you are,

10:48.064 --> 10:49.941
well, it's going to sting
so much more

10:50.066 --> 10:51.234
when I never talk
to you again.

10:51.359 --> 10:51.943
Shh!

10:54.946 --> 10:57.282
Eres muy buena.

10:57.407 --> 11:02.245
Debes enseñar una clase
de... como ser sangrona.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.291
Y tu debes tomar una clase

11:06.416 --> 11:09.919
en como no ser metiche.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.296
Nice.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.381
Mexican nanny?
Honduran.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.425
Hello. No talking.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.061
Okay, remember to
fasten your seat belt,

11:27.187 --> 11:28.813
make sure your mirrors
are adjusted...
Adjust my mirrors,

11:28.938 --> 11:30.190
BOTH:
...and your
parking brake is off.

11:30.315 --> 11:31.983
And?
I got it.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.735
And, and, don't play
the radio too loud,

11:34.861 --> 11:36.196
don't drive when tired

11:36.321 --> 11:38.615
and don't get distracted
by the other kids in the car.

11:38.739 --> 11:41.284
So did Ethan finally
ask you to homecoming?

11:41.409 --> 11:43.411
Way to slip that one in.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.372
Um, kind of.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.207
We're going to hang
when we get there,

11:47.332 --> 11:49.292
but we're not actually
going together, so it's kinda...
Annie...

11:49.417 --> 11:51.252
I just distracted you.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.253
Oh, well, that was sneaky.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.796
That's my point.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.465
Okay, onward.
Hmm...

11:55.590 --> 11:57.008
Now, always remember
your license

11:57.133 --> 11:58.092
and your insurance card.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.093
We're with State Farm.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.387
If you ever get pulled over...

12:00.512 --> 12:02.138
I won't.
You never know.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.558
The insurance card is
right here in the glove box.
Got it. Thanks.

12:04.683 --> 12:07.310
Now, can we talk about what kind
of car you're going to get me?

12:07.435 --> 12:09.020
When we talk about what kind
of job you're going to get!

12:09.145 --> 12:11.356
Right.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.988
Adrianna, you
have a visitor.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.407
I do?

12:30.333 --> 12:32.126
Navid?

12:32.252 --> 12:33.587
What are you doing here?

12:33.712 --> 12:36.005
I'm actually here to do
a story for the Blaze News.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.840
Let you tell your
side of the story.

12:37.965 --> 12:40.427
Inside the walls of Currents--

12:40.552 --> 12:42.803
it's a... it's a privilege.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.514
That's one weird way
of looking at it.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.433
Give me your phone.
What?

12:46.558 --> 12:48.435
They don't let
us have our own.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.562
They let us use the pay phone
once a day.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.231
It's kind of like prison
in 1970.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.567
Wait, you're not texting any
lowlifes, are you? 'Cause I

12:55.692 --> 12:57.985
really can't have...
I'm texting Naomi.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.281
I left her like 15 messages
before I came here.

13:01.406 --> 13:02.990
Hey, well, look, uh...

13:03.116 --> 13:05.285
I got you some really great
reading material.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.870
Check it out.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.084
So how are you
doing in here?

13:13.209 --> 13:15.503
I'm not doing your
stupid story,

13:15.629 --> 13:18.256
so you can just get
the hell out of here.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.467
Hey, well, um...

13:20.592 --> 13:23.303
Listen, if, uh... if you ever
want to talk, you know...

13:23.428 --> 13:25.930
off the record...

13:26.055 --> 13:28.015
just give me a call, okay?

13:35.356 --> 13:37.233
(PDA chirps)

13:59.880 --> 14:02.216
WOMAN:
Well, just tell me what
you're thinking.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.513
I'm thinking...

14:06.638 --> 14:08.264
I don't want to talk to you.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.809
Hmm.

14:10.933 --> 14:14.145
I'm thinking that
you are not my friend.

14:14.270 --> 14:19.567
I'm thinking I want to talk
to my real friend, Naomi.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.069
That's good. You're claiming
responsibility.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.155
Claiming
responsibility, yeah.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.114
Mm-hmm.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.492
So what?

14:27.617 --> 14:30.036
Obviously it was my fault.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.415
I don't want to miss her.

14:36.793 --> 14:41.381
She was trying to help me,
and then I hurt her...

14:41.506 --> 14:47.053
so badly, so deeply that...

14:47.178 --> 14:50.390
she's never going to forgive me.

14:50.515 --> 14:53.226
And I can't live with myself

14:53.351 --> 14:55.478
knowing that I did
something that awful.

14:59.774 --> 15:03.528
All you can do right now
is be here.

15:03.653 --> 15:06.989
This is the last place
I want to be.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.209
SILVER:

What?

15:24.131 --> 15:26.593
It is easy to get
your wisdom teeth out.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.595
I loved it.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.598
Yeah. It was pretty
fun for me, too.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.015
Except you've been
singing that song

15:33.140 --> 15:34.601
for the last
half hour.

15:34.726 --> 15:37.437
It's like a perfect song.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.355
It's, like, my favorite song.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.191
Yeah, okay.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.526
Well, um, you stay here.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.695
I'm going to go get you
some water, all right?

15:45.820 --> 15:47.572
The doctor said
take two more of these

15:47.697 --> 15:49.657
in three hours, but,

15:49.783 --> 15:51.659
uh, I think I might
have to cut the doses

15:51.785 --> 15:54.454
in half, because you seem pretty
responsive to the medication.

15:54.579 --> 15:57.998
Thank you so much.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.167
I'm just... so happy

16:00.293 --> 16:03.713
right now.
Aren't you so happy?

16:03.838 --> 16:05.840
(tap running)
Um... pretty happy.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.593
But probably not as
happy as you are.

16:08.718 --> 16:11.596
I'm so glad that we both
hate homecoming.

16:11.721 --> 16:16.016
This is
so much better.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.144
I'm gonna lie down.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.062
Okay.

16:20.187 --> 16:23.149
Take...

16:25.443 --> 16:27.695
Guess not.

16:33.284 --> 16:34.410
(laughing)

16:34.535 --> 16:36.036
Hello.
Hey.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.121
How'd it go?

16:37.246 --> 16:38.623
I got my permit.
Whoo!

16:38.748 --> 16:40.291
I got 100% on the test.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.335
And in a few weeks
when I turn 16...

16:42.460 --> 16:44.044
I-I don't even want
to think about it.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.922
I will be cruising
down Sunset.

16:46.046 --> 16:47.715
Yeah, see, now that's where I
got in my first accident.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.383
Me and a bunch of my buddies

16:49.509 --> 16:51.761
were...
Screwing around in the car
and got distracted?

16:51.886 --> 16:53.262
Something like that.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.389
Hmm, yeah, see, I know
not to do that.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.183
That's because women
are better drivers.

16:57.308 --> 16:58.351
ANNIE:
Mm-hmm!
Not true.

16:58.476 --> 16:59.560
Here, you can learn
a few things, Dad.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.937
It's never too late.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.314
Don't you have a dance
to get ready for?

17:03.439 --> 17:04.315
Hmm...

17:05.817 --> 17:07.609
Congratulations.
Thank you.

17:07.734 --> 17:09.612
Thanks for calling.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.739
It was nice
to hear from you.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.782
So what's up?

17:13.907 --> 17:15.535
There's some country
western singer

17:15.660 --> 17:17.369
that's supposed to
be some big deal...

17:17.494 --> 17:20.498
Yeah?
She was snoring
so loudly last night,

17:20.623 --> 17:22.709
I couldn't sleep.

17:22.834 --> 17:26.753
I figured you could
use that for your story.

17:26.880 --> 17:30.800
That's pretty good, but,
uh, I'm not actually doing
that story anymore.

17:30.925 --> 17:34.512
Just wanted
to check up on you.

17:34.637 --> 17:36.472
And I figured, uh,
since I was coming,

17:36.597 --> 17:38.307
I'd bring you
some supplies.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.685
Not the kind I'm
dreaming about, I bet.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.144
Brought you some sketch
paper, colored pencils.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.563
Uh, I don't know if you draw,

17:43.688 --> 17:45.565
but I figured everybody
likes to doodle, so...

17:45.690 --> 17:48.818
Uh, and, uh, oh yeah, this is
going to be awesome right here.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.571
Oh, yeah, uh...

17:51.696 --> 17:53.907
got you a little gift box
with shampoo--

17:54.032 --> 17:57.243
uh, lavender extract, and
conditioner and, uh... toner,

17:57.368 --> 17:58.703
which I honestly don't
know what that is,

17:58.828 --> 18:00.663
but my mom suggested it.

18:00.788 --> 18:01.706
Um... oh, one more thing--

18:01.831 --> 18:04.417
I got you a couple DVDs.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.419
Do they let you watch DVDs?

18:06.544 --> 18:09.672
Yeah, as long as we don't
sprinkle coke on our popcorn,

18:09.797 --> 18:10.840
it's all good.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.675
Oh, great.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.343
Uh, enjoy then.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.220
Navid...

18:16.345 --> 18:19.432
I need you to do
something for me.

18:19.557 --> 18:22.393
Yeah, uh, what's that?

18:22.518 --> 18:25.646
Bring Naomi here, okay?

18:25.772 --> 18:27.147
Get her to talk to me.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.819
I... well, I mean, I can ask
her, but I don't... I don't know

18:31.945 --> 18:33.905
if I can make her...
Please.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.281
Please, can you
bring her here?

18:35.406 --> 18:36.657
Will you do that for me?

18:36.783 --> 18:39.535

but, uh, it was
worth the wait.
Oh...

19:42.056 --> 19:44.558
Yeah, we fight, but he's
probably my best friend.

19:44.684 --> 19:45.852
That's cool.

19:45.977 --> 19:46.978
I always thought
an older brother

19:47.103 --> 19:48.604
would, you know,
look out for me,

19:48.729 --> 19:49.605
kick anybody's ass...
Yeah!

19:49.730 --> 19:52.608
...who messed with me,
that sort of thing.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.318
All right, look.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.739
(gasps)
Oh, wow.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.282
You look gorgeous!

20:00.407 --> 20:02.743
You are going to get
some action tonight, girl.

20:02.869 --> 20:03.744
(all laugh)

20:03.870 --> 20:05.454
Big smile.

20:05.579 --> 20:06.706
(shutter clicks)

20:06.831 --> 20:08.624
Mm-hmm!

20:08.749 --> 20:11.002
Ah! Too bad Adrianna's not here.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.420
NINA: Can I see that before you
put another picture

20:13.546 --> 20:16.423
of me with my eyes closed on
your FaceBook page?

20:16.549 --> 20:18.425
Annie, shoes time.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.927
I'm gonna wear
these, I think.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.261
These will look
great for you.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.806
Really? But they look
so expensive.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.641
Oh, whatever.
They're just shoes.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.354
Um, Naomi, can I ask you
something?

20:30.479 --> 20:31.856
Yeah, of course. What's up?

20:31.981 --> 20:34.942
Is it weird that you're not
going to homecoming with Ethan?

20:35.068 --> 20:37.778
Ethan and I broke up.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.989
It'd be weird if I was going
with him.

20:40.114 --> 20:41.908
Well, I know, but...

20:42.033 --> 20:44.702
Look, we've broken up
so many times.

20:44.827 --> 20:45.995
And so many times
afterwards

20:46.120 --> 20:47.747
I've just wanted him
to be miserable,
you know?

20:47.872 --> 20:50.875
This time's different.
I just want him to be happy.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.334
And I want to be happy, too.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.335
(chuckles)

20:53.460 --> 20:54.754
(knock at door)

20:54.879 --> 20:55.713
Is everybody decent?

20:55.838 --> 20:57.631
Ask Nina.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.676
Oh, yeah, I am.

21:00.801 --> 21:01.677
(all chuckle)

21:01.802 --> 21:04.471
Well, Naomi, you have
a gentleman caller.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.973
What? Who?

21:06.099 --> 21:08.017
Come on in!

21:10.019 --> 21:11.520
Thank you.
Sure.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.981
Hey, uh,

21:14.107 --> 21:16.358
can I talk to you for a minute?

21:19.112 --> 21:21.614
(groaning)

21:21.739 --> 21:23.866
(video game
explosions and beeps)

21:23.991 --> 21:25.576
Ah, baby,
you awake?

21:25.701 --> 21:29.496
No, I'm asleep,
but I'm talking to you.

21:29.622 --> 21:33.209
(groans) My mouth feels
so frickin' bad.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.502
When was I supposed
to take another pirate?

21:35.628 --> 21:36.963
(snickers)
A what?

21:37.088 --> 21:40.007
A pill. What did I say?

21:40.133 --> 21:41.926
Don't laugh at me.

21:42.051 --> 21:45.179
Aw, I can't help it.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.473
But, uh, you were supposed
to take another pill...

21:47.598 --> 21:50.977
uh, about an hour ago,
but you were asleep.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.520
You should have woken me up!

21:53.646 --> 21:56.023
Now it's gonna take an hour
for this one to kick in.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.692
(groans)

21:58.818 --> 22:01.612
Sweetheart, which one?

22:01.737 --> 22:04.073
Well, the green one
goes better with
what I'm wearing,

22:04.198 --> 22:06.784
and I want to remind Tracy
that we go together

22:06.909 --> 22:08.619
just in case she gets confused.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.205
Don't worry.
I won't be confused.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.041
Well, I'm sure
as hell confused.

22:14.167 --> 22:15.835
Why don't you say
something to her?

22:15.960 --> 22:17.377
To who?

22:17.503 --> 22:20.589
To Tracy. Good Lord, Debbie,

22:20.714 --> 22:23.009
I didn't know Kansas women
had no cojones.

22:23.134 --> 22:25.052
I've got it, Tabitha.

22:25.178 --> 22:27.221
That woman kissed your husband.

22:27.345 --> 22:29.807
Yes, and my husband
and I have dealt with it,

22:29.932 --> 22:31.058
and it's over.

22:31.184 --> 22:32.977
I understand what happened.

22:33.102 --> 22:36.063
What else would you do
in Wichita,

22:36.189 --> 22:37.690
bake her a cake?

22:37.815 --> 22:40.651
This is Beverly Hills,
sweetheart.

22:40.776 --> 22:43.487
You really shouldn't be
drinking, Tabitha.

22:43.612 --> 22:46.073
It's Kool-Aid.

22:46.199 --> 22:51.078
Look, I could squash you
with an eye roll,

22:51.204 --> 22:53.956
but you could take on Tracy.

22:54.081 --> 22:57.960
When it comes to class,
brains and beauty, my dear,

22:58.085 --> 23:00.213
she's no match for you.

23:03.090 --> 23:06.635
Tabitha, I think that's

23:06.760 --> 23:08.846
the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.848
Oh, that's okay.

not even make it
to homecoming.

You're a terrible liar, Navid.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.310

be there.

Silver, how are you feeling?

25:37.911 --> 25:39.621
I'm good, I think.

Is Dixon taking good care

25:49.131 --> 25:51.008
Apparently.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.259
Yeah, well,

25:52.385 --> 25:54.303
he must be really
into you, girl,

25:54.428 --> 25:56.722
'cause he really wanted
to come to this dance.

25:56.847 --> 25:58.057

25:58.182 --> 25:59.599
Yeah, he loves this stuff.

27:39.283 --> 27:40.784
Oh, no, it's okay.

27:40.909 --> 27:43.496

do you think of
my dance moves?

27:46.248 --> 27:47.625
Pretty sick, huh?

27:47.749 --> 27:50.544
Oh, yes, I am stunned
by your one move.

27:50.668 --> 27:53.755
Oh, no, no, no, I, uh...
I have more than one move.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.721
So how much longer
are you in detention, anyway?

28:01.847 --> 28:03.140

28:03.265 --> 28:05.017
Damn, girl, you were bad.

28:05.142 --> 28:07.436
I was just in there for one day.

28:07.561 --> 28:10.105
Maybe I can get some more time
if I go and steal

28:10.230 --> 28:12.107
your big face picture
out in the hallway.

28:12.232 --> 28:14.443

29:09.081 --> 29:10.499

29:10.624 --> 29:12.710
No, they don't. You're a liar.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.337
You can't come and go
out of rehab.

29:15.462 --> 29:18.632
Naomi, can we go talk?

29:18.757 --> 29:21.218
No, we can't talk, because
I'm not talking to you.

29:22.135 --> 29:23.095

(sighs)

30:16.523 --> 30:18.734
Geez, man, am I the only
damn kid in this school?

30:18.858 --> 30:20.569
Is there absolutely nobody else
that you can harass?

30:20.694 --> 30:22.028
Not at the moment, sorry.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.781
What are you doing with this,
huh, Kimberly?!

30:23.905 --> 30:25.324
What the hell are you doing
with this stuff?

30:25.449 --> 30:27.159
I guess I just get bored easily.
Why do you care?

30:27.284 --> 30:28.118
Let's go.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.329
Where to?

30:30.454 --> 30:32.831
Just start walking.

30:34.583 --> 30:35.542
The private investigator
should have

30:35.668 --> 30:37.252
some information for
us by the end of the...

30:37.377 --> 30:39.463
That's great. I have to get
back to the party.

30:39.588 --> 30:42.466
Harry, you will never guess
who I just ran into.

30:42.591 --> 30:44.343
Tracy.

30:44.468 --> 30:47.596
Hi. I'm so sorry
I stole him away.

30:47.721 --> 30:50.015
We were talking
about our son.

30:51.684 --> 30:54.144
We'll have to finish that later.

30:56.313 --> 30:57.856
Harry...
I am so sorry. She caught
me in the hallway.

30:57.981 --> 31:00.275
This has to stop. I am tired
of smiling and pretending

31:00.400 --> 31:01.694
that everything is okay
when it's not.

31:01.819 --> 31:04.154
I know, I know, but she is
a piece of work,

31:04.279 --> 31:05.698
and I-I don't know what to do.

31:05.823 --> 31:07.491
I've been thinking, and her
behavior makes me realize

31:07.616 --> 31:08.492
that I am right.

31:08.617 --> 31:10.118
About what?

31:10.243 --> 31:12.287
We need to tell the kids
about your birth son
No.

31:12.412 --> 31:14.748
sooner than later, Harry.

31:14.873 --> 31:15.957
(sighs)
Okay, yeah.
You're right.

31:16.082 --> 31:17.626
I mean, I haven't
told them 'cause I,

31:17.751 --> 31:19.586
I don't want to hurt them.
Yeah, well,

31:19.712 --> 31:21.963
it's gonna hurt a lot more if
they hear it from someone else.

31:22.088 --> 31:24.257
How do we know she
hasn't told people?

31:24.383 --> 31:25.217
RYAN:
Harry!

31:25.342 --> 31:26.259
Need you.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.345
Hey, can we finish this later?

31:28.470 --> 31:30.639
I have to take care
of something.

31:30.764 --> 31:32.140
Yeah.

31:32.265 --> 31:33.559
Me, too.

31:36.645 --> 31:37.521
Caught her buying drugs.

31:37.646 --> 31:40.399
Okay. I will
take these.

31:40.524 --> 31:43.235
And?
Take care of it.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.236
That's it?

31:44.361 --> 31:45.320
And you can go now.

31:45.445 --> 31:46.822
No, I'm not
going anywhere

31:46.946 --> 31:49.032
until you tell me exactly
what is gonna happen.

31:49.157 --> 31:50.492
Okay, she comes
into my classroom...

31:50.617 --> 31:53.245
Ryan, I told you before to
stay out of this.

31:53.370 --> 31:55.330
Yeah, and maybe that's
why the problem's
getting worse, Harry.

31:55.455 --> 31:56.373
I got it covered.

31:56.498 --> 31:58.458
Really? You
have it covered?
Yeah.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.001
That's why there's dogs
running around sniffing
lockers at school?

32:00.126 --> 32:01.670
And you busted the wrong kid?

32:01.795 --> 32:04.506
And now you've got kids
buying drugs at dances.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.132
Okay?
Can you please keep
your voice down?

32:06.258 --> 32:07.843
No, I'm not gonna keep
my voice down, all right?

32:07.967 --> 32:10.679
I'm tired of this crap.
You don't know how to
deal with these kids,

32:10.804 --> 32:12.890
and you don't know how to
protect them, and I'm going

32:13.014 --> 32:14.808
to the board, 'cause you don't
know what you're doing, okay?

32:14.933 --> 32:16.685
And if they don't listen,
I'm going to the L.A. Times.

32:16.810 --> 32:19.020
Oh, for God's sakes.
I'm a cop, you dumbass.

Hey. (sighs)

It's pretty intense.

32:58.435 --> 33:00.395
Welcome to my life.

33:03.231 --> 33:05.609
You don't think
there's any way

33:05.734 --> 33:08.194
you could be friends
with Adrianna again?

33:08.320 --> 33:13.241
Just like I said, it's
too much drama, you know?

33:13.366 --> 33:16.495
I just don't need
that anymore.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.622
That's why I like you.

33:18.747 --> 33:20.081
You're so...

33:20.206 --> 33:21.082
Boring?

33:21.207 --> 33:23.251
No, not at all.

33:23.376 --> 33:24.377
Stable.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.799
I really want to be
your friend, Annie.

33:28.924 --> 33:31.384
I know I haven't acted
like it, but I do.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.387
I would really like that.

33:36.807 --> 33:39.351
It's just this one thing.

33:39.476 --> 33:41.728
Honestly...

33:44.982 --> 33:47.818
I don't think we can be
friends if you're with Ethan.

33:47.943 --> 33:52.197
Um, but you said
at your house...

33:52.322 --> 33:55.450
I know. At my house,
not here.

33:55.575 --> 34:00.747
Watching you, him, both
of you dancing together.

34:00.873 --> 34:04.376
But you broke up with him.

34:04.501 --> 34:07.337
I know, and I can't stop him
from dating other people.

34:07.462 --> 34:11.257
I know that.
It just can't be you.

34:11.382 --> 34:14.177
Not if we're gonna
be friends.

34:14.302 --> 34:16.722
Friends tell each other
everything, you know?

34:16.847 --> 34:18.806
And if you're with Ethan,

34:18.931 --> 34:21.141
I'm not gonna want to hear
about your... your first kiss

34:21.266 --> 34:24.353
or-or going out on dates
with him, you know?

34:24.478 --> 34:30.360
These are things that we're
supposed to share together.

34:30.485 --> 34:33.154
It's just, I mean,
how would it feel

34:33.279 --> 34:34.614
if I went out with your ex?

34:34.739 --> 34:36.616
(laughs)

34:36.742 --> 34:39.452
It'd be weird.

34:43.581 --> 34:48.545
Annie, boyfriends come and go,
but friends stick together.

34:48.670 --> 34:50.422
Do they?

34:50.547 --> 34:52.424
Through everything?

34:52.549 --> 34:53.425
That's different.

34:53.550 --> 34:55.594
No, it doesn't have to be.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.930
You don't know what
it's like with Adrianna.

34:58.055 --> 35:02.893
No, no, I-I don't,
but if it hurts you this much

35:03.018 --> 35:05.771
to watch Adrianna do this
to herself,

35:05.896 --> 35:09.315
then what are you gonna do
if you really lose her?

35:09.441 --> 35:11.359
(applause and cheering
in distance)

35:15.822 --> 35:17.490
(clears throat)

35:20.452 --> 35:22.370
Huh?

35:22.495 --> 35:24.998
What?

35:25.123 --> 35:27.250
Don't sleep through
your opportunity

35:27.375 --> 35:28.877
to take a chipmunk
to homecoming.

35:29.002 --> 35:31.296
For real?

35:31.421 --> 35:34.507
For real.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.509
I thought we hated homecoming.

35:36.635 --> 35:39.345
Uh, I'm on to you.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.806
Let's go.

35:40.931 --> 35:43.600
All right. Well,
I gotta stop home

35:43.725 --> 35:45.936
and get my stuff, but...

35:46.061 --> 35:49.982
But don't be afraid
to tell me stuff, okay?

35:50.107 --> 35:52.275
We don't have to agree
on everything.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.443
Hey, come on now.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.654
Who said I was afraid?

35:55.779 --> 35:57.864
I was just being nice.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.742
Well, then don't be so nice.

36:00.867 --> 36:03.328
Okay, I...

36:03.453 --> 36:05.664
Just shut up and kiss me.

36:09.584 --> 36:12.337
(groans)

36:12.462 --> 36:14.006
That hurt.
That hurt.

36:14.131 --> 36:16.299
We'll get some
aspirin on the way.

36:16.424 --> 36:17.300
♪ ♪

36:17.425 --> 36:18.510
Take care!

36:18.635 --> 36:21.429
Tracy, I want to be
very clear on something.

36:21.554 --> 36:22.973
Yes?

36:23.098 --> 36:25.976
Just because you're on
the Parents Board

36:26.101 --> 36:28.061
and I'm the principal's wife...

36:28.186 --> 36:29.562
You know what, Debbie?
I actually was

36:29.688 --> 36:31.481
gonna go talk to some people
over there,

36:31.606 --> 36:33.566
so would you mind just
getting to the point?

36:33.692 --> 36:37.946
If you ever kiss my husband
again or touch him

36:38.071 --> 36:39.865
or look at him in the wrong way,

36:39.990 --> 36:42.492
you and I will have
a very big problem.

36:42.617 --> 36:46.121
Gosh, I don't know how I would
get through the day

36:46.245 --> 36:48.165
knowing that you were
angry at me.

36:48.289 --> 36:53.045
Let me define "big problem,"
just so we're clear.

36:53.170 --> 36:55.588
I will hit you in the face
so hard

36:55.714 --> 36:57.382
I will knock your teeth out.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.387
You enjoy the rest
of your evening, Tracy.

37:02.512 --> 37:04.305
I know I will.

37:06.933 --> 37:09.352
Hey, Eric.

37:09.477 --> 37:12.731
Hey, Adrianna.
How was your vacation?

37:12.856 --> 37:15.817
It was very relaxing.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.694
But I could get more relaxed.

37:17.819 --> 37:20.655
All right, then.

37:24.201 --> 37:25.952
Get out! Get out,
Adrianna! Get out!

37:26.078 --> 37:27.704
What the hell are you doing?!
Get out!

37:27.829 --> 37:29.164
Don't you ever sell
to her again,

37:29.288 --> 37:31.708
you lowlife piece of crap,
you hear me?

37:31.833 --> 37:33.418
(groans)
Control your
woman, Ade,

37:33.543 --> 37:36.796
or next time it's gonna get
a lot worse.

37:36.922 --> 37:37.839
Navid, are you okay?

37:37.964 --> 37:39.591
Why are you doing this?

37:39.716 --> 37:41.968
What do you mean,
why am I doing this?

37:42.094 --> 37:45.889
Because I want to,
because it feels good.

37:46.014 --> 37:47.640
Why are you doing this?

37:47.766 --> 37:49.059
Are you blind?

37:49.184 --> 37:50.852
You're always doing this,
"Woe is me" crap

37:50.977 --> 37:52.187
and how you have no friends,

37:52.311 --> 37:54.022
and I'm sitting here right
in front of you!

37:54.147 --> 37:54.981
What are you
talking about?!

37:55.107 --> 37:56.649
I like you,
Adrianna, okay?!

37:56.775 --> 37:58.693
I like you!

37:58.818 --> 38:00.695
There, I said it, 'cause God
knows you would have noticed.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.321
Stop. Stop it.

38:02.447 --> 38:03.949
No, I've liked you
since middle school.

38:04.074 --> 38:06.118
When we were kids
and we used to hang out

38:06.243 --> 38:08.620
making those stupid versions
of big movies together?

38:08.745 --> 38:09.662
Don't do...

38:09.788 --> 38:11.623
I need...
Normal stuff.

38:11.748 --> 38:12.916
I need you to stop.

38:13.041 --> 38:13.959
I'm not gonna stop, okay?

38:14.084 --> 38:15.460
I need you
to stop.

38:15.585 --> 38:17.336
Hey, I can't stop.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.714
We used to be so close.

38:19.839 --> 38:22.634
Then you got in the seventh
grade and you got that sitcom

38:22.759 --> 38:25.344
and it was like you didn't
even know me anymore.

38:25.470 --> 38:28.932
But I never forgot you.

38:29.057 --> 38:31.768
I never forgot
who you used to be.

38:31.893 --> 38:35.605
Who I used to be... right.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.607
(sobbing)

38:41.778 --> 38:43.155
(chuckling)

38:43.280 --> 38:46.449
Do you remember
when I agreed

38:46.574 --> 38:49.494
to do Lord of the Rings...

38:49.619 --> 38:52.538
so that you'd do a scene
from Princess Diaries?

38:52.664 --> 38:54.082
(giggling)

38:54.207 --> 38:55.541
Do you remember that?

38:55.667 --> 38:57.169
Yeah.

38:57.294 --> 38:59.879
I would always
do anything for you.

39:00.005 --> 39:02.215
Why do you think...?

39:02.340 --> 39:03.424
(applause and cheers
in distance)

39:03.549 --> 39:06.178
Oh, my God.

39:06.303 --> 39:09.555
Did you pay to get
me into Currents?

39:12.142 --> 39:13.018
(voice breaks):
Oh, my God.

39:13.143 --> 39:15.394
Yeah, I did.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.272
My dad did.

39:17.396 --> 39:20.859
I just, uh, had
to get him to do it.

39:20.984 --> 39:23.153
Hey, hey, hey.

39:23.278 --> 39:25.530
I just want you
to get better, okay?

39:25.655 --> 39:28.658
I want you to get back
to who you used to be.

39:28.783 --> 39:30.618
All right?

39:30.743 --> 39:31.703
(sobs)

39:31.828 --> 39:33.412
Adrianna.

39:35.248 --> 39:37.625
Oh, I'm so sorry.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.878
Shh.
I am so sorry.

39:40.003 --> 39:41.546
I know, I know, I know.

39:43.840 --> 39:46.301
(murmurs):
Adrianna...

39:46.425 --> 39:49.221
I'm not gonna
let you down, okay?

39:49.346 --> 39:52.224
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

39:52.349 --> 39:55.560
I'm gonna make
sure nothing does.

39:55.685 --> 39:59.397
(sobbing continues)

40:07.780 --> 40:10.158
Um...

40:10.283 --> 40:11.784
I can't do this.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.661
Can't do what?

40:13.786 --> 40:17.290
I... I can't do "us" to Naomi.

40:17.415 --> 40:20.668
I get where she's coming
from, and I like her.

40:20.793 --> 40:22.628
Do you like me?

40:22.754 --> 40:23.963
What?

40:25.006 --> 40:26.799
Do you like me?
