00:01.460 --> 00:02.960
It's gorgeous, isn't it?

00:02.961 --> 00:05.129
- Oh, yeah, wow.
- It's so pretty.

00:05.130 --> 00:08.799
Oh, I just can't believe that
we're actually getting married.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.135
Yeah. Neither can the
pig that just flew by.

00:11.136 --> 00:12.102
Oh!

00:13.705 --> 00:16.707
I for one am happy that
you're making mom so happy.

00:16.708 --> 00:20.678
We all know if mom's happy, she spends
a lot less time making us unhappy,

00:20.679 --> 00:21.746
so, I'm happy.

00:21.747 --> 00:25.316
Thanks, guys. I'd hug you,
but this is a really good suit.

00:25.317 --> 00:27.318
I've gotta get to work.
I will see you...

00:27.319 --> 00:28.486
- later.
- M'kay.

00:28.487 --> 00:30.388
You really do like the ring?

00:30.389 --> 00:33.289
Oh, it is everything
I ever dreamed of.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.028
I love it, I love it, I love it.

00:37.029 --> 00:38.928
I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!

00:39.931 --> 00:42.199
What are you talking about?
It's beautiful.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.899
And the best part is, if the diamond
falls out no one will notice.

00:46.905 --> 00:48.939
Yeah. That's the problem.

00:48.940 --> 00:52.843
This ring is supposed to shout to the
world that I am marrying a younger,

00:52.844 --> 00:57.043
beautiful man, but all it shows is
that my fiance is a cheap bastard!

00:58.183 --> 01:02.071
That Brad is a lucky, lucky guy.

01:03.155 --> 01:04.221
Whoa, there goes another one.

01:04.221 --> 01:05.456
Okay, stop it. Stop it.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.173
They just keep going.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.991
(laughing)

01:19.992 --> 01:22.273
I can't believe Riley is
still dating old man Ross.

01:22.274 --> 01:24.341
<i>Sure, he's an attorney.</i>

01:24.342 --> 01:26.577
Makes a lot of money.
Great shape.

01:26.578 --> 01:28.178
I just don't know
what she sees in him.

01:29.414 --> 01:33.316
So I said, "actually, lawyers
do it in their briefs."

01:33.317 --> 01:34.698
(All laughing)

01:34.699 --> 01:36.487
Okay, I need to call it a night.

01:36.488 --> 01:38.255
I have to be in court
early tomorrow.

01:38.256 --> 01:39.457
See you in the morning?

01:39.458 --> 01:41.425
Hey, do you mind if I
share a cab with you?

01:41.426 --> 01:42.560
Early morning for me too.

01:42.561 --> 01:44.528
Are you sure? I can
walk you home.

01:44.529 --> 01:47.230
No, finish your drink. I'll
text you when I get there.

01:48.266 --> 01:49.232
Bye.

01:51.470 --> 01:52.470
See?

01:52.471 --> 01:55.172
I told you we could just
go back to being us.

01:55.173 --> 01:56.607
Dating other people.

01:56.608 --> 01:59.110
Right in front of each other.

01:59.111 --> 02:00.276
Not awkward at all.

02:03.348 --> 02:05.315
I need to go get another drink.

02:07.419 --> 02:08.419
Wow.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.588
Early night. I saw
Ross taking off.

02:10.589 --> 02:13.524
Curfew back at the rest home?

02:14.326 --> 02:16.560
Ben, seriously, when are you
going to just let this go?

02:16.561 --> 02:20.231
Okay, so he's a
little older than me.

02:20.232 --> 02:21.398
Could you be any more immature?

02:21.399 --> 02:24.502
Rhetorical, rhetorical.
That wasn't a dare.

02:24.503 --> 02:27.983
I got it. I'll be
good, I promise.

02:28.340 --> 02:30.174
I just can't believe you
like hanging out with him.

02:30.175 --> 02:32.376
Or any of his friends. What
do you guys talk about?

02:32.377 --> 02:34.345
Uh, nothing?

02:34.346 --> 02:37.154
Since I haven't actually
met any of his friends.

02:38.049 --> 02:39.183
I know what you're thinking.

02:39.184 --> 02:43.854
He hasn't introduced me because he's
embarrassed by our relationship.

02:43.855 --> 02:46.023
That's not true.

02:46.024 --> 02:49.693
Actually, I just assumed it's
because they're all dead.

02:49.694 --> 02:51.695
You know what?
That's it, I'm done.

02:51.696 --> 02:53.458
- No, Riley...
- I said done.

02:55.400 --> 02:59.015
Gosh. So hard to see
why you two broke up.

02:59.504 --> 03:01.238
I should go apologize to her.

03:01.239 --> 03:02.506
I just can't help it, man.

03:02.507 --> 03:05.242
I hate seeing her with Ross when
I know she should be with me.

03:05.243 --> 03:06.977
We're perfect together.

03:06.978 --> 03:07.945
Like you and Ashley.

03:07.946 --> 03:08.878
<i>(Phone buzzes)</i>

03:10.048 --> 03:11.849
Or should I say "Ashley two."

03:11.850 --> 03:13.918
Why is your girlfriend listed
as "Ashley two" on your phone?

03:13.919 --> 03:17.821
Oh, because when I was in
Calgary, I dated that one Ashley,

03:17.822 --> 03:20.658
and then when I met this one, I kind of
forgot to ask her what her last name was.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.627
So now it's been six weeks.
I think it's too late.

03:23.628 --> 03:28.265
Danny, it's actually never too late to find
out what your girlfriend's last name is.

03:28.266 --> 03:30.333
And Calgary girl's
name was Amber.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.437
I wonder if that's
why we broke up.

03:33.438 --> 03:35.405
No, it's probably
something else.

03:38.276 --> 03:40.244
Why, why, why, Tucker?

03:40.245 --> 03:43.179
I, I, I wish you would
stop talking to me.

03:45.884 --> 03:46.951
You don't understand.

03:46.952 --> 03:50.554
The first time I got married, ray
couldn't afford to buy a ring

03:50.555 --> 03:53.524
because we squandered all
of our money on baby food.

03:53.525 --> 03:54.557
And my prom dress.

03:55.627 --> 03:59.128
This ring is my chance to
finally get it all right.

03:59.731 --> 04:02.233
If you think the ring was the
problem with your last marriage,

04:02.234 --> 04:04.100
then I don't think you
know how gay works.

04:05.937 --> 04:08.072
But with that said, I get it.

04:08.073 --> 04:10.241
What about this. What if...

04:10.242 --> 04:12.009
The ring just
accidentally disappears.

04:12.010 --> 04:13.744
- Accidentally?
- Yeah.

04:13.745 --> 04:15.846
Just put it on the counter,
and I'll handle the rest.

04:15.847 --> 04:17.714
Oh my God, Tucker,
you're a genius.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.783
I know. I'll say that I
was doing the dishes.

04:19.784 --> 04:21.918
Or something more believable?

04:21.920 --> 04:25.622
Just turn around and
you'll never see it again.

04:27.638 --> 04:31.507
Okay, now under no circumstances
ever give it back to me again.

04:31.508 --> 04:34.014
Tucker? Tucker?

04:36.948 --> 04:38.597
Wow. Talk about two
birds, one stone.

04:39.567 --> 04:41.431
Ooh, a sandwich.

04:44.315 --> 04:46.916
Hey, Riley... Oh, hey, Ross.

04:46.917 --> 04:48.051
Ben, hi.

04:48.052 --> 04:50.953
When I said "pop by anytime,"
that was just a figure of speech.

04:52.823 --> 04:54.757
I was just hoping I could
talk to you for a second.

04:55.229 --> 04:57.362
Yeah, not a problem. I'll just
go finish in the bedroom.

04:59.722 --> 05:01.722
The movie we were watching.

05:04.594 --> 05:05.860
What do you want?

05:05.861 --> 05:07.629
Listen, I thought about it
all night, and you're right.

05:07.630 --> 05:10.398
I keep saying I want to be a good
friend, and then I do the opposite.

05:10.399 --> 05:14.535
So if you like Ross as much as you say you
do, then I will learn to like him too.

05:15.805 --> 05:17.504
Or at least pretend to like
him so well you can't tell.

05:20.276 --> 05:23.044
Thank you. Apology accepted.

05:23.045 --> 05:27.182
And I would like you to know that I
will be meeting all of Ross's friends.

05:27.183 --> 05:30.218
Yeah, I'm throwing a
little cocktail party.

05:30.219 --> 05:34.656
Wow, a cocktail party.
Look at you all grown up.

05:34.657 --> 05:36.091
Hey, um, will you come?

05:36.092 --> 05:38.660
And be the supportive
person I know you can be?

05:38.661 --> 05:41.029
Yes, of course. Anything else?

05:41.030 --> 05:42.797
Yeah, get out. We were kind of
in the middle of something.

05:42.798 --> 05:44.733
Oh, bang-de-bang.
Shmoo-de-shmoo.

05:44.734 --> 05:46.600
Oh, my God. Get out, get out!

05:48.003 --> 05:50.678
I don't know why I'm
being so crazy, Emma.

05:50.679 --> 05:54.347
He probably won't even notice
that the ring is gone.

05:55.383 --> 05:57.084
Not when you got all this.

05:57.085 --> 05:58.352
Right? Mm-hmm.

05:58.353 --> 05:59.987
Knuckles. Give it. Boo.

05:59.988 --> 06:01.889
- Hey hey hey.
- Oh, hi. Hey.

06:01.890 --> 06:04.225
Are my two favorite girls
ready to get some lunch?

06:04.226 --> 06:07.962
- Where is your ring?
- Oh, uh...

06:07.963 --> 06:09.697
- Yeah, um... my ring...
- Oh, my God.

06:09.698 --> 06:11.098
You didn't lose it?

06:11.099 --> 06:13.601
Please tell me you did
not lose that ring.

06:13.602 --> 06:15.569
Bonnie, that ring is
a family heirloom.

06:15.570 --> 06:17.004
My great great grandfather

06:17.005 --> 06:19.506
gave that to my great great grandmother
on the day of their engagement.

06:20.575 --> 06:21.542
I did not know that.

06:21.543 --> 06:25.446
And then when the war broke out, and
his country called him to duty.

06:25.447 --> 06:27.481
She put that ring on a
chain around his neck

06:27.482 --> 06:30.284
with the promise of coming back
to his true love in one piece.

06:30.285 --> 06:31.661
He was killed two days later,

06:31.662 --> 06:36.467
but that ring has gone down in my
family from generation to generation.

06:36.468 --> 06:39.704
My grandfather to my grandmother,
my father to my mother,

06:39.705 --> 06:41.372
and now from me to you.

06:41.373 --> 06:45.208
That ring is priceless and
everlasting, just like our love.

06:46.378 --> 06:47.477
Geez, you're long-winded.

06:49.214 --> 06:50.213
You didn't let me finish.

06:50.825 --> 06:54.527
It's not lost, it's just at
the jewelers getting resized.

06:54.528 --> 06:56.763
Yeah, it'll be back in time for
our engagement pictures tomorrow.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.431
I promise.

06:58.432 --> 07:00.500
You know what? I'm just
gonna let Tucker know

07:00.501 --> 07:02.535
that we are going out. He
likes to stay informed.

07:02.536 --> 07:03.536
Um, here.

07:03.537 --> 07:04.603
Okay.

07:05.606 --> 07:06.538
Such a story.

07:11.345 --> 07:14.147
- Tucker!
- I'm not doing anything.

07:14.148 --> 07:15.348
Sorry.

07:15.349 --> 07:17.951
It's just my gut reaction when
a mom walks into my room.

07:17.952 --> 07:19.185
Look, I need that ring back.

07:19.186 --> 07:21.053
You said "under no
circumstances."

07:21.054 --> 07:23.757
- (Growls)
- Okay!

07:23.758 --> 07:24.990
- These are pretty good circumstances.
- Yeah.

07:25.910 --> 07:27.143
- It's in my pocket.
- Okay.

07:29.146 --> 07:30.913
At least, I thought
it was in my pocket.

07:30.914 --> 07:32.048
Wait, wait.

07:32.049 --> 07:33.783
- I know where it is.
- Okay.

07:33.784 --> 07:34.750
Where are you going?!

07:37.788 --> 07:39.521
- (Groans)
- No!

07:43.394 --> 07:44.393
Here you go.

07:45.662 --> 07:47.012
Dude, did you get her to
sign the fake guest book?

07:47.013 --> 07:49.132
Yep. And her last name is...

07:49.133 --> 07:50.366
She's got bad handwriting.

07:50.367 --> 07:54.137
"A-s-h-l-e..." Yes!

07:54.138 --> 07:55.904
Her name's Ashley Ashley.

07:58.371 --> 07:59.303
Damn it.

08:03.376 --> 08:05.410
- Ben.
- Hey, Ross the boss.

08:05.411 --> 08:06.645
How's it going, man?

08:06.646 --> 08:09.146
You know, if you come through
the back, you can use the ramp.

08:10.183 --> 08:11.149
I'm sorry.

08:11.150 --> 08:12.918
That was the last one.
I promised Riley.

08:12.919 --> 08:15.254
In fact, I'm actually looking forward
to your little cocktail party.

08:15.255 --> 08:18.134
- Here, on the house.
- Yeah, about that.

08:18.135 --> 08:20.970
How about we have a
little chat man to man.

08:20.971 --> 08:24.807
- Or however close you can get to that.
- Okay, not on the house.

08:24.808 --> 08:27.610
Look, I know all about you and Riley.
She told me everything.

08:27.611 --> 08:29.445
Sorry, dude. I'm a
tough act to follow.

08:29.446 --> 08:32.548
But she seems to think that
you two are just friends now.

08:32.549 --> 08:34.317
But I'm not an idiot, Ben.

08:34.318 --> 08:36.157
It's pretty obvious that
you're still in love with her.

08:36.643 --> 08:40.379
So this is me just letting you know
that Riley, she's moved on, okay?

08:40.380 --> 08:43.148
She tried the boy,
now she has the man.

08:43.149 --> 08:44.349
What are you saying?

08:44.350 --> 08:45.984
I'm saying

08:45.985 --> 08:50.054
I'm sorry, but you can't come to the party.
I'll give Riley your regrets.

08:51.791 --> 08:54.792
Oh, you're gonna be the one with regrets
that you ever messed with me... aah!

09:02.321 --> 09:04.923
Oh, God. I feel like I'm
forgetting something.

09:04.924 --> 09:06.224
Right, I have food, drinks,

09:06.225 --> 09:08.093
music, and I'll find
something with like

09:08.094 --> 09:09.995
a really good beat...
Oh, my god, beets!

09:09.996 --> 09:11.930
- I forgot the beet salad.
- Riley!

09:11.931 --> 09:14.112
Riley, everything is
gonna be perfect.

09:14.113 --> 09:16.444
Okay? Because you are perfect.

09:17.330 --> 09:19.263
Hey, guys. Hope I'm not late.

09:20.154 --> 09:23.023
Ben. What are you doing here?

09:23.024 --> 09:24.156
I thought you couldn't make it.

09:26.132 --> 09:27.464
Isn't that what you told me?
That you couldn't make it?

09:27.862 --> 09:31.865
No, Ben knew how stressed I was, so
he volunteered to be our bartender.

09:31.866 --> 09:33.566
Isn't he the sweetest?

09:33.567 --> 09:34.901
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

09:34.902 --> 09:37.370
Figured I'd be a nice
guy and help out.

09:37.371 --> 09:39.238
It's the manly thing to do.

09:41.509 --> 09:43.108
Don't you think?

09:49.083 --> 09:51.161
Oh, my God! I've been robbed.

09:51.162 --> 09:53.228
Where is it?! I need
to find that ring!

09:55.373 --> 09:57.306
Wait, did you go through
all my drawers?

09:58.275 --> 09:59.274
All of them.

10:00.444 --> 10:02.310
Which is why I can't make
eye contact with you now.

10:04.348 --> 10:06.015
Now find my ring

10:06.016 --> 10:07.116
- or I am calling your mother!
- No.

10:07.117 --> 10:08.885
<i>Yes, find it!</i>

10:08.886 --> 10:11.788
- (Imitating phone dialing)
- No, stop it!

10:11.789 --> 10:13.922
Hello, Mrs. Dobbs.

10:15.993 --> 10:17.794
So Ashley, I was thinking

10:17.795 --> 10:18.995
when I finally meet
your parents some day,

10:18.996 --> 10:20.830
what should I call them?

10:20.831 --> 10:23.466
Stan and Judy would be fine.

10:23.467 --> 10:27.503
But if you really want to impress them,
maybe go with Mr. and Mrs. Cooper.

10:27.504 --> 10:28.603
Cooper!

10:30.240 --> 10:32.442
He's actually my step-dad and
my mom took his last name.

10:32.443 --> 10:33.542
That's why it's
different from mine.

10:35.112 --> 10:36.179
Hey, I found this
ring on the floor.

10:36.180 --> 10:37.246
Oh.

10:37.247 --> 10:39.215
That's my mom's. She hates it.

10:39.216 --> 10:40.315
I'll just leave it on
the counter for her.

10:42.186 --> 10:44.287
Hey, what's up, guys? Hey, you
guys coming to Riley's party?

10:44.288 --> 10:47.957
If you are, make sure you subtly work in
that you think Ross is all wrong for her,

10:47.958 --> 10:50.959
and all his friends are boring losers and if
she's gonna date anyone, it should be me.

10:52.996 --> 10:53.995
But don't be obvious about it.

10:55.632 --> 10:56.833
You got it.

10:56.834 --> 10:58.568
Oh, if you see mom, tell her
her ring's on the counter.

10:58.569 --> 10:59.534
What?

11:03.507 --> 11:04.639
Damn it.

11:06.376 --> 11:07.609
Still cleaner than
the cups I'm using.

11:13.217 --> 11:14.417
So...

11:14.418 --> 11:15.952
What do you think?

11:15.953 --> 11:18.387
Are people having a good time? I feel
like people aren't having a good time.

11:18.388 --> 11:20.156
Why would you say that?

11:20.157 --> 11:22.190
Because I heard that girl say
she's not having a good time.

11:24.128 --> 11:26.095
It's because you're
different people.

11:26.096 --> 11:27.764
You're generation Y.

11:27.765 --> 11:29.765
They're generation "why's
the music so loud."

11:31.602 --> 11:34.503
If I can't make it work with his friends,
how can I make it work with him?

11:35.572 --> 11:37.540
Maybe Ross and I are
just too different.

11:37.541 --> 11:40.014
(Scoffs) That's crazy, Riley.

11:40.015 --> 11:41.783
I mean, I would never say that,

11:41.784 --> 11:43.717
but I support your decision
to break up with him 100%.

11:46.128 --> 11:47.928
Thank you for being you.

11:56.905 --> 11:59.574
I can't thank you
enough for tonight.

11:59.575 --> 12:02.543
- Everyone's having a great time.
- Really?

12:02.544 --> 12:05.680
Trust me when I say this, every guy
here that met you wants to be me,

12:05.681 --> 12:07.547
and every woman here
wants to be you.

12:09.418 --> 12:13.354
- No they don't.
- They most certainly do.

12:13.355 --> 12:16.223
You, Riley, are
an amazing woman.

12:25.834 --> 12:28.870
That's how you do it, son.
You got it?

12:28.871 --> 12:31.838
Oh, I more than got it. Now
I'm gonna get it back.

12:39.548 --> 12:41.516
Tucker, what am I gonna do?

12:41.517 --> 12:45.186
I was supposed to meet Brad to take
our engagement pictures an hour ago.

12:45.187 --> 12:50.124
- And I'm having a really good hair day.
- No, I'm having a good hair day.

12:50.125 --> 12:51.958
You're just having a day.

12:53.362 --> 12:54.328
Oh, hey.

12:54.329 --> 12:56.314
You guys are missing
a great party.

12:56.315 --> 12:57.381
Well, a party.

12:59.085 --> 13:00.251
Did Ben bring you the ring back?

13:01.254 --> 13:03.021
- My ring?
- Yeah.

13:03.022 --> 13:04.222
I left it on the counter.

13:04.223 --> 13:06.224
Ben! Thank God.

13:06.225 --> 13:09.093
Okay, Tucker, come on. We are gonna
go crash Riley's lame party.

13:11.197 --> 13:13.031
Ben, hi, sweetie.

13:13.032 --> 13:14.966
- Give me my ring.
- What ring?

13:14.967 --> 13:17.602
My engagement ring. That
was on the counter?

13:17.603 --> 13:18.737
Counter... (Gasps)

13:18.738 --> 13:20.739
Oh, I wonder if it got mixed
up with the ice I spilled.

13:20.740 --> 13:21.807
Okay, where's the ice?

13:21.808 --> 13:22.740
Everywhere.

13:25.511 --> 13:27.279
You take right, I'll take left.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.245
- Okay.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

13:35.955 --> 13:38.190
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

13:38.191 --> 13:39.958
I'm just looking for...

13:39.959 --> 13:41.792
Oh, breath spray. Here we go.

13:43.796 --> 13:44.896
That's perfume.

13:44.897 --> 13:48.900
Danny, I'm not an idiot. Going through
my purse? The guest book signing?

13:48.901 --> 13:51.503
You calling me to
take a fake survey?

13:51.504 --> 13:53.372
You don't know my
last name, do you?

13:53.373 --> 13:55.506
I'm not even gonna dignify
that with a response.

13:56.509 --> 13:57.441
Murphy?

13:58.540 --> 14:01.647
I can't believe you. Don't call me.
Lose my number.

14:01.648 --> 14:04.101
I'd say lose my name, but
you already did that.

14:04.102 --> 14:08.104
- Ashley, I'm sorry. Wait, I can explain.
- I had sex with you.

14:08.105 --> 14:10.738
And I'm sorry, but I know so
many other things about you.

14:11.875 --> 14:13.709
Like you laugh when you sneeze.

14:13.710 --> 14:16.712
You've got two really cute
freckles on your back,

14:16.713 --> 14:17.847
and your cat's name,

14:17.848 --> 14:19.482
Sparkles McGee.

14:19.483 --> 14:22.284
Great, so you know
my cat's last name.

14:22.285 --> 14:23.719
Just give me a second chance,

14:23.720 --> 14:26.481
and I promise I will learn there is
everything there is to know about you.

14:32.963 --> 14:34.997
Wow. That was fast.

14:34.998 --> 14:37.932
You used the two freckles line?
Works every time.

14:44.355 --> 14:45.938
(Chuckles)

14:47.644 --> 14:49.612
Mm-mm. Hey.

14:49.613 --> 14:51.680
Excuse me, man. I think you
might have grabbed my drink

14:51.681 --> 14:53.582
off of the table, so...

14:53.583 --> 14:55.384
Mm.

14:55.385 --> 14:57.419
Mm-mm.

14:57.420 --> 14:59.621
That wasn't it. Okay.

15:02.717 --> 15:05.592
And that's why they
invented the swizzle stick.

15:06.494 --> 15:08.728
God, Mrs. Wheeler, what
the hell are you doing?

15:08.729 --> 15:10.597
Does an alarm go off
in your apartment

15:10.598 --> 15:12.632
every time someone
serves free liquor?

15:12.633 --> 15:16.068
No. But that'd be a great idea.

15:17.748 --> 15:21.716
Bonnie, where have you been?
And where is your ring?

15:23.660 --> 15:27.430
Okay, Brad, I don't know
how to tell you this.

15:27.431 --> 15:28.664
So I'm just gonna
go with the truth.

15:30.401 --> 15:32.469
The jewelry store burnt
down to the ground.

15:32.470 --> 15:34.203
My ring is gone.

15:35.881 --> 15:38.549
(Coughing)

15:41.078 --> 15:43.113
A ring? (Gasps)

15:43.114 --> 15:44.914
Oh, my God. You want
me to marry you.

15:44.915 --> 15:45.915
Yes!

15:45.916 --> 15:47.249
Yes, I will marry you.

15:48.886 --> 15:50.086
Are you crazy?

15:50.087 --> 15:52.838
I'm just dating you until
Steve and Marcy break up.

15:54.792 --> 15:56.101
- Hey, Steve.
- No.

15:57.561 --> 16:00.663
Mrs. Wheeler, look!
I found your ring!

16:00.664 --> 16:02.764
Told you we'd get it back
without Brad finding out.

16:05.162 --> 16:06.776
Oh, hey, Brad.

16:07.865 --> 16:09.833
Bonnie, I can't believe
you lied to me.

16:09.834 --> 16:11.902
You are a disgrace
to my pop pop's

16:11.903 --> 16:13.837
pop pop's pop pop.

16:13.838 --> 16:15.038
Brad.

16:15.039 --> 16:17.573
I only lied because I didn't
want to tell the truth.

16:20.611 --> 16:23.346
Wow. This was fun.

16:23.347 --> 16:24.614
You bring your mommy
to all your parties?

16:24.615 --> 16:28.385
You know, underneath those fancy
clothes and expensive hair cut,

16:28.386 --> 16:32.255
I look at you and all I see
is a desperate old man.

16:32.256 --> 16:34.224
Well, I'd rather be that

16:34.225 --> 16:37.060
than be an immature boy who's
done nothing with his life

16:37.061 --> 16:39.229
other than father an
illegitimate child.

16:39.230 --> 16:42.165
Nobody calls my daughter that.
You want to take this outside?

16:42.166 --> 16:43.900
No, no, no, no, no, no.

16:43.901 --> 16:46.870
Okay, nobody is taking
anything outside

16:46.871 --> 16:48.805
except maybe this tray
of hors d'oeuvres.

16:48.806 --> 16:50.472
Look, the eggs are
little penguins.

16:51.542 --> 16:53.908
You know? I'd love
to take it outside.

16:53.909 --> 16:55.545
(Exhales)

16:55.546 --> 16:57.480
Oh, man.

16:57.481 --> 16:59.282
Guys, can you stop it? Ross!

16:59.283 --> 17:01.284
Will you two stop it?

17:01.285 --> 17:03.520
Come back inside. You're
both acting like children.

17:03.521 --> 17:05.622
I hope you're ready for this.
Oh, I'm ready.

17:05.623 --> 17:08.358
Will you be ready?

17:08.358 --> 17:10.093
Please do something?

17:10.094 --> 17:12.127
Why? They're not doing anything.

17:13.396 --> 17:14.998
Yeah.

17:14.999 --> 17:17.934
I mean, it's just two
guys that look like Ben

17:17.935 --> 17:20.135
circling the two guys
that look like Ross.

17:21.271 --> 17:23.940
What is going on out here?
You woke up Emma.

17:23.941 --> 17:25.007
Mom, take Emma back inside.

17:25.401 --> 17:27.592
(Gasping)

17:27.593 --> 17:28.042
Big mistake.

17:28.940 --> 17:30.428
- (Screams)
- (Gasping)

17:31.716 --> 17:33.848
Okay. Party's over.

17:33.849 --> 17:35.074
(Laughs)

17:35.075 --> 17:36.042
Time to go home.

17:36.043 --> 17:39.144
Don't stay out too late.
Excuse me.

17:39.692 --> 17:42.193
I love these sconces so much.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.903
Hey!

17:51.904 --> 17:53.871
Boss the Ross.

17:55.241 --> 17:58.976
Oh, hey, have you seen my apartment?
'Cause I can't find it anywhere.

17:59.979 --> 18:03.015
I just don't understand
what Riley sees in him.

18:03.016 --> 18:04.583
Him who?

18:04.584 --> 18:05.884
- Ben.
- (Scoffs)

18:05.885 --> 18:11.522
What are you worried about him for?
Danny is the one she's in love with.

18:13.359 --> 18:14.559
<i>(Elevator dings)</i>

18:14.560 --> 18:16.427
My apartment's here.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.365
Can't waste any of that.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.007
I'm sorry about all this.

18:29.008 --> 18:31.143
I was jealous of Ben and
I acted like a child.

18:31.144 --> 18:35.614
How about we just erase this whole
night and pretend it never happened?

18:35.615 --> 18:38.716
You know I'd love that, believe me.
There's nothing I would want more.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.688
- But I can't.
- Why?

18:45.391 --> 18:47.559
You didn't tell me you
had feelings for Danny.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.429
Danny?

18:50.430 --> 18:51.648
Yeah, you told me about Ben,

18:51.649 --> 18:53.649
but you didn't tell me about
the other guy across the hall

18:54.685 --> 18:56.419
and that tells me
everything I need to know.

18:56.420 --> 19:00.489
No. No, Ross. It
is not like that.

19:00.879 --> 19:04.048
I don't know why I didn't
say anything about him.

19:04.049 --> 19:05.849
I didn't think I needed to.

19:07.119 --> 19:09.453
But that doesn't mean that I
don't want to be with you.

19:12.947 --> 19:16.682
Oh, my God. Are we
breaking up right now?

19:18.853 --> 19:21.888
Ross, please. I really
care about you.

19:21.889 --> 19:24.490
I don't know. I have some
things I need to think about.

19:25.342 --> 19:26.407
It sounds like you do, too.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.180
Bye, Riley.

19:35.219 --> 19:36.252
Ross...

19:36.253 --> 19:37.586
Want another piece of me?

19:39.290 --> 19:42.258
I'm sorry about that. I
guess I hit the wrong guy.

19:42.259 --> 19:43.459
Hell yeah, you did.

19:48.633 --> 19:51.634
- You okay?
- Not really.

19:53.437 --> 19:56.339
I think we just broke up.

19:56.340 --> 19:58.608
Riley, everything
is gonna be okay.

19:58.609 --> 20:01.678
Ross is just some guy you dated.
He's not the one.

20:01.679 --> 20:05.247
- How do you know that?
- I just do.

20:06.584 --> 20:08.350
Is there anything i can do
to make you feel better?

20:10.287 --> 20:11.387
Just be my friend?

20:13.691 --> 20:16.392
Right. You got it.

20:20.626 --> 20:21.655
Brad...

20:22.106 --> 20:26.109
You have to forgive me. I had no
idea how much the ring meant to you.

20:26.110 --> 20:27.276
Bonnie, I didn't just meet you.

20:27.277 --> 20:30.079
- I knew you hated it.
- Okay, but I don't anymore.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.949
And I swear that i
will never ever

20:32.950 --> 20:35.984
for any reason ever
take it off again.

20:40.023 --> 20:41.257
Would you take it off for this?

20:41.258 --> 20:43.892
Oh, my god. I would take
everything off for that.

20:44.711 --> 20:47.019
- Still my great grandma's.
- Right, right! Sorry, sorry!
