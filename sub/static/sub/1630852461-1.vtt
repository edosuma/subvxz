1:11:14.618 --> 1:11:16.837
and I am privileged to say that

1:11:18.839 --> 1:11:21.929
Rachel had been my best friend
since ninth grade.

1:11:23.931 --> 1:11:27.761
We formed
an immediate connection and...

1:11:29.894 --> 1:11:33.332
and developed a bond that

1:11:33.376 --> 1:11:36.553
continued for the past 26 years.

1:11:42.385 --> 1:11:44.430
I knew that in Rachel
I had a friend for life.

1:11:45.997 --> 1:11:47.825
We shared
a lot of our lives together

1:11:47.868 --> 1:11:54.005
because she was so willing to...
to invest her time and her heart

1:11:54.048 --> 1:11:55.528
into her friends.

1:11:55.572 --> 1:11:57.487

and I miss her dearly.

As you all know, Rachel...

1:12:10.717 --> 1:12:13.154
Um, Rachel was never the type
to settle.

1:12:13.198 --> 1:12:15.331
She always demanded
more of herself

1:12:15.374 --> 1:12:19.073
and always wanted
the best for her family
and for her friends.

1:12:19.117 --> 1:12:24.514
So in addition to raising
two wonderful boys,
Evan and Christopher,

1:12:24.557 --> 1:12:27.168
whom she was so proud of,

1:12:27.212 --> 1:12:31.738
she opened her home
with no hesitation to Mary Ann

1:12:33.349 --> 1:12:35.829

1:12:35.873 --> 1:12:38.005

because, in Rachel,

1:12:52.629 --> 1:12:54.674

1:13:28.055 --> 1:13:30.449
We all have one

1:13:30.493 --> 1:13:32.886
question before us today
and that question is

1:13:32.930 --> 1:13:37.456

to these events.

at least mention that he, too,
is a child of God.

1:15:47.804 --> 1:15:51.808
And he, too, has passed
into another life, prematurely.

a combination of
multiple stab wounds,

a severed carotid artery,

1:15:59.642 --> 1:16:02.775
numerous blunt-force traumas,
and a broken jaw.

1:16:05.517 --> 1:16:09.652
But the severed artery alone
probably caused her death.

Why did he kill Evan?
Why did he do that?

1:16:13.133 --> 1:16:18.661
Well, Ben said, based on
physical evidence and
comments from Christopher...

1:16:21.664 --> 1:16:28.192
it appears Evan
attempted to... to stop Danny
from attacking Rachel

1:16:28.235 --> 1:16:31.456

possibly thinking Logan Vonda
was behind him.

had blood on his back,

pushing Christopher
into his room.

ran out of adrenaline,

He was given the opportunity
to choose darkness and light.

1:46:20.939 --> 1:46:22.419
In his confusion,

1:46:22.463 --> 1:46:26.075
it was the darkness
