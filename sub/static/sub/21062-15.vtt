30:27.340 --> 30:30.161
on school property.

30:30.210 --> 30:33.338
In their eyes,
it's vandalism.

30:33.390 --> 30:37.121
The decision was
suspension for 30 days.

30:37.180 --> 30:41.389
- A month?
- There's a fine line here,
Micah.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.135
And you crossed it.

30:43.180 --> 30:46.001
Next time,
be more careful.

30:48.410 --> 30:50.139
[ footsteps ]

30:50.190 --> 30:52.146
Blue:
Do you think Pop
would take me to Italy?

30:52.190 --> 30:53.976
Or Mommy?

30:54.020 --> 30:56.409
I'm sure they would.

30:57.980 --> 31:00.710
But what if me
and your Aunt Vi
took you?

31:00.770 --> 31:02.988
Then I could go, too!

31:03.030 --> 31:04.634
I like that idea.

31:05.860 --> 31:06.986
Auntie Nova!

31:07.030 --> 31:09.112
Mmm, hey...

31:09.170 --> 31:10.728
my little Blue bear!

31:13.430 --> 31:14.988
How's school?

31:15.040 --> 31:17.349
- My teacher showed us
pictures of Italy.
- Oh.

31:17.390 --> 31:19.563
She says they have
really good pizzas.

31:19.610 --> 31:23.080
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. I'd eat pizzas
every day.

31:23.140 --> 31:25.779
You sure you wouldn't miss
your Aunt Vi's cooking?

31:25.840 --> 31:28.741
Violet:
Who wouldn't miss
my cooking?

31:30.450 --> 31:34.921
I mean, yeah, of course
I'm gonna miss your cooking.

31:34.980 --> 31:38.757
You're the best chef
in the entire world.

31:40.240 --> 31:42.060
In the entire world,
Blue?

31:42.110 --> 31:44.158
- Yeah, I know for sure.
- Oh.

31:44.200 --> 31:45.246
You heard him.

31:45.290 --> 31:46.769
[ giggles ]

31:46.810 --> 31:48.949
[ Blue mumbles ]

31:48.990 --> 31:52.721
Okay, so, what is
your favorite meal?

31:52.780 --> 31:55.726
'Cause I'm gonna cook
whatever you want tonight.

31:55.780 --> 31:58.681
Anything I want?
Like, anything?

31:58.740 --> 31:59.957
Anything.

32:01.780 --> 32:05.216
I want the wings
fried up in the pan.

32:05.270 --> 32:07.488
- Extra crispy.
- Hollywood: Mm.

32:07.530 --> 32:10.613
Also with
the honey barbecue sauce.

32:10.660 --> 32:13.743
Lots and lots
of sauce.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.360
Got it. Okay, so now,
what about the sides?

32:19.020 --> 32:22.490
[ Blue and Violet sigh ]

32:22.540 --> 32:26.328
Okay... Ithink
I'm gonna go

32:26.370 --> 32:29.589
with the red beans
mixed up with the rice
mixed up with shrimp.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.028
All mixed up together.

32:31.070 --> 32:33.118
Nova:
All mixed up
together.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.947
And can I not have
any greens?

32:35.990 --> 32:38.129
Boy, that's the best part!

32:39.560 --> 32:41.903
Hollywood, hush.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.088
This _is Blue's
speCIal meal.

32:45.130 --> 32:48.042
- You got no say.
- [ Blue chuckles ]

32:48.090 --> 32:49.739
I'll allow you to have
a piece, okay?

32:49.790 --> 32:51.439
Thank you.

32:51.490 --> 32:53.913
My tummy's ready,
Auntie Vi.

32:53.970 --> 32:56.962
- Oh!
- [ chuckles ]

Charley on phone:
Hi, you've reached
Charley Bordelon.

33:01.500 --> 33:02.922
I can't get to the phone
right now,

33:02.980 --> 33:04.322
so please leave
a message.

33:04.370 --> 33:06.884
- [ beeps ]
- Yo, what's up, Charley?

33:06.940 --> 33:09.283
You know
what's g0ing on
at the mill.

33:09.330 --> 33:12.504
Rumors flying,
nobody picking up.

33:12.550 --> 33:13.983
Hit me back.

33:16.250 --> 33:18.889
- [ phone clicking ]
- [ sighs ] Come on, Remy.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.206
[ line ringing ]

33:22.260 --> 33:23.943
Remy:
Hey, you've reached
Remy Newell.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.865
- Can't get to the phone
right now...
- Damn!

33:29.310 --> 33:31.471
Ain't like them
to not call me back.

33:32.610 --> 33:35.090
Something
don't feel right.

33:35.140 --> 33:37.529
I left messages
for Charley, too.

33:40.100 --> 33:42.056
[ sighs ]
Well, maybe something
isgoing on.

33:42.100 --> 33:43.488
You know what it is.

33:43.540 --> 33:47.055
Them Boudreaux boys
up to no good.

33:47.110 --> 33:49.408
Come on, now.

33:49.460 --> 33:53.453
Well, we all saw
the splinter go down
at ribbon cutting.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.111
I don't know,
maybe...

34:00.730 --> 34:03.164
Maybe she's moving
too fast on this.

34:04.820 --> 34:07.607
You know, I'm looking
at truckloads of cane sitting

34:07.650 --> 34:10.289
and you can't even
get your-- your mill
on the phone.

34:10.350 --> 34:12.989
- I know.
- And what--
what does Darla say?

34:14.480 --> 34:16.528
She's sitting
right outside
of the office.

34:16.570 --> 34:18.561
Where does she say
Charley is?

34:21.620 --> 34:23.520
Excuse me.

34:23.580 --> 34:25.059
Ralph A--

34:37.460 --> 34:39.246
Nova:
If Lizy doesn't write this,

34:39.290 --> 34:41.508
someone else _
that's less friendly Will.

34:41.550 --> 34:45.816
This way, I can at least
have some control
over the story.

34:45.860 --> 34:47.555
She's a friend.

34:50.780 --> 34:53.032
You talk to the other farmers
and you do this article,

34:53.090 --> 34:54.569
_We can_ turn this
into a piece about

34:54.610 --> 34:57.124
how you're being treated
by the Landrys,

34:57.180 --> 35:00.616
about the systematic racism
against black farmers
and now you,

35:00.660 --> 35:03.094
the only black mill owner
in the state.

35:03.140 --> 35:05.313
We can fight this.

35:07.060 --> 35:08.834
You can turn it around.

35:11.760 --> 35:14.058
After this, there'll be
something else.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.401
Something after that.

35:22.550 --> 35:26.850
I mis_calculated
their greed.

35:26.900 --> 35:27.980
Remy:
Fine.

35:28.030 --> 35:30.248
But now it's time
to do new math.

35:31.950 --> 35:33.906
Now we got to get out
to the remaining farms

35:33.950 --> 35:36.601
and talk to folks
together.

35:36.650 --> 35:40.177
'Cause sitting here
is nothing but a pity party.

35:40.220 --> 35:43.656
One of the greatest gifts
you got from your father
is your fight.

35:45.230 --> 35:47.698
Both of you.

35:47.750 --> 35:51.538
Charley, fight back.

35:55.100 --> 35:57.239
Yeah, I'll fight,
all right.

35:58.540 --> 36:00.679
Good.
Which farm first?

36:00.720 --> 36:03.234
If you could handle
the remaining farms
on your own,

36:03.290 --> 36:04.541
that would
help me out.

36:04.590 --> 36:06.717
Happy to do it.

36:06.770 --> 36:08.249
Thank you.

36:09.640 --> 36:11.460
And, Nova,
you're right.

36:11.510 --> 36:14.331
I should talk to your friend,
set the record straight.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.342
But I need to make
a stop first.

36:18.390 --> 36:20.039
Where are you going?

36:20.090 --> 36:21.648
To the source.

36:28.010 --> 36:30.262
What it is, bro?

36:30.310 --> 36:32.653
Everybody's spooked.

36:32.710 --> 36:34.439
All the rumors
about the mill.

36:36.230 --> 36:39.051
- What's going on?
- Everything is fine, man.

36:39.100 --> 36:40.715
The mill is fine.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.796
That's just the Landrys
using fear tactics,

36:42.850 --> 36:45.318
trying to get back
the business they lost,
that's all.

36:47.500 --> 36:50.719
I got more cane
coming off them fields
early morning

36:50.770 --> 36:52.897
and Charley
ain't answering my calls.

36:52.940 --> 36:55.113
She went to see
the Landrys face-to-face.

36:55.160 --> 36:57.162
We've been talking
to them.

36:57.210 --> 36:58.199
How'd that work out?

37:00.210 --> 37:02.121
[ sighs deeply ]

37:02.170 --> 37:03.990
It ain't gonna change.

37:04.040 --> 37:05.826
It's personal.

37:05.870 --> 37:09.044
It ain't_about harvest
and they ain't gonna give up.

37:09.090 --> 37:12.139
Not till they get
that land back.

37:13.270 --> 37:16.091
Well, look here,

37:16.140 --> 37:18.791
don't worry.

37:18.840 --> 37:20.967
Your sister knows
What she's doing.

37:22.540 --> 37:24.235
She'll figure it out.

38:05.370 --> 38:09.750
Well, so much
for privacy.

38:09.800 --> 38:13.065
I won't tell
anybody anything
you don't want me to say.

38:15.680 --> 38:19.411
But since I'm here
and I know...

38:21.560 --> 38:22.948
Lupus can be rough.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.816
But it can also
be managed.

38:31.220 --> 38:33.029
Yesterday was bad.

38:34.310 --> 38:35.823
Today was better.

38:37.570 --> 38:41.836
And to-tomorrow hopefully
Will be better still.

38:44.360 --> 38:46.408
I'm gonna put you
on my own regimen.

38:46.450 --> 38:48.668
The organic route.

38:48.710 --> 38:50.575
Nature's medicine.

38:53.980 --> 38:55.629
Double duty.

Yes.

Thank you,
Dr. Bordelon.

39:06.560 --> 39:09.199
I'll be here,
but you decide

39:09.250 --> 39:11.298
Yeah, you decide

When you wanna
fall into my arms

Fall into my arms

Go on, take your time,
take a breath

39:54.520 --> 39:58.035
When you've had
to take it back

39:58.090 --> 40:03.039
Oh, baby,
know you can take it back

40:03.090 --> 40:07.652
It's never gonna
stay this way

40:09.450 --> 40:11.964
When the tears
that you cried

40:12.010 --> 40:16.014
Don't say
What you feel inside

I'll be here,
but you decide

40:18.980 --> 40:20.936
Yeah, you decide

40:20.980 --> 40:25.155
When you wanna
fall into my arms

- Fall into my arms
- 'Cause I know that
you're hurting

it's a sure thing
