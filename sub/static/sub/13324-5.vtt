00:02.711 --> 00:04.629
So, Patrick, this brings up a good question.

00:04.797 --> 00:07.715
How does a pile of your boyfriend's
clothes end up on fire?

00:08.634 --> 00:12.679
l know that one.
You catch him staring at your sister's ass.

00:13.597 --> 00:16.057
l'm pretty sure that wasn't
Patrick's problem, Lacey.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.310
lt's very simple.
My mother, God rest her soul,

00:19.395 --> 00:24.023
always said that the best way to get gum out
of an angora sweater is with kerosene.

00:24.108 --> 00:26.150
Lots and lots of kerosene.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.611
Sure, and napalm gets out red wine.

00:30.197 --> 00:33.700
So, what l'm hearing is you're upset
with Scott, so you lit his clothes on fire?

00:33.992 --> 00:36.119
ls that why they call you people flamers?

00:38.080 --> 00:41.582
l don't mean nothing.
l'm just trying to learn here.

00:42.418 --> 00:45.086
Yes. Yes, Ed.
The burning of the boyfriend's clothes

00:45.170 --> 00:47.088
has been a fabulous gay ritual
since ancient times.

00:48.048 --> 00:51.676
Way back to when my great,
great, great, great

00:51.760 --> 00:55.263
grandfather boned your,
l don't know, dad, l guess.

00:57.891 --> 01:01.102
That was a great quip. l can't quip.

01:02.312 --> 01:05.022
Anyway, to make a long story short,

01:05.107 --> 01:08.067
my boyfriend and l had a heart-to-heart
and he agreed to put his clothes

01:08.152 --> 01:09.777
in the hamper from now on.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.198
l think Scott and l living together
is gonna work out fine.

01:14.283 --> 01:15.616
Just fine.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.452
l wish l could quip.

01:18.120 --> 01:21.414
l sort ofjust try to think of something
clever to say, then l just sort of ramble.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.291
-Then by the time l...
-Thank you, Nolan.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.211
-Unfortunately our time is up.
-But wait.

01:27.296 --> 01:28.713
l have another issue.

01:28.797 --> 01:32.300
l think my mother's ghost
is haunting my apartment.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.845
You're so lucky. My mother's still alive.

01:37.306 --> 01:38.890
Patrick, we'll talk about your
ghost next time.

01:39.975 --> 01:42.393
And, guys, guys, guys, l know l've said it
1 ,000 times,

01:42.478 --> 01:46.147
but if you're going to bring up the undead,
try to do so at the beginning of the session.

01:46.231 --> 01:50.735
Yeah, and we can have s'mores,
like, around the campfire in the backyard.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.069
'Cause of the ghost story.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.156
Yes, nailed the quip.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.077
-Hey, Charlie.
-Hi.

02:00.162 --> 02:02.914
Lori will be here any minute.
This is a great business idea.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.332
You're gonna love it.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.918
Yeah, l read the brochure and l know
you're hoping l was going to invest,

02:07.002 --> 02:09.879
but l'm not sure anyone
needs a manicure on wheels.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.423
Although the name Vanicures is terrible.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.469
Charlie, women have nail emergencies.

02:16.595 --> 02:19.680
"Oh, no, l ruined my nail.
What am l going to do?

02:19.765 --> 02:22.016
"l'm on my way to a big job interview."

02:22.100 --> 02:24.769
Cool. lf you get it,
can we drop the alimony?

02:25.020 --> 02:26.813
Shut up, l'm in the middle of a pitch.

02:26.897 --> 02:31.108
Oh, yeah. "l'm gonna call Vanicures.
They come right to you and repair the nail,

02:31.276 --> 02:34.862
"so nobody knows you were this close
to your life falling apart."

02:36.365 --> 02:37.448
So what do you think?

02:37.616 --> 02:40.743
l think if your life is falling apart
because of a broken nail,

02:40.869 --> 02:43.120
you need a mobile psych ward.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.873
-So you don't like it?
-Jen.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.211
This is a terrible, terrible idea.

02:56.468 --> 03:00.221
-Hi.
-Hi. You must be Lori.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.223
-Yes.
-l'm Charlie. Come on in.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.558
Thanks.

03:04.226 --> 03:09.397
Jen was just telling me about your
incredibly hot business idea.

03:11.733 --> 03:12.817
Yeah, it's going really well.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.527
l brought the prospectus
for you to look over.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.113
Don't need to. l support this woman
in everything she does.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.783
Yeah, it's like a big open-handed
slap of support.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.953
You know, Lori, l've always said
that the measure of a man

03:24.037 --> 03:25.746
is in how much he's willing to do for his ex.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.165
Oh, well, Jen's lucky.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.544
My ex can be a little difficult.

03:33.255 --> 03:36.007
Nuts. A total maniac.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.135
-A real whack job.
-We get it.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.851
l don't see what the problem is.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.769
All l'm asking you to do
is give me Lori's number,

03:48.854 --> 03:50.605
then make a call saying how great l am.

03:50.689 --> 03:53.274
-Absolutely not.
-Okay.

03:54.276 --> 03:56.319
Don't make a call saying how great l am.
Just give me her number.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.946
-Absolutely not.
-Okay, okay.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.657
Don't make a call saying how great l am,
don't give me her number,

04:01.742 --> 04:03.784
just leave your phone on the table
and go grab a snack.

04:05.537 --> 04:08.039
l'm not setting you up
with a business associate.

04:08.123 --> 04:11.626
Besides, you wouldn't like her.
You only date empty-headed young girls.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.502
That is a gross generalization.

04:13.629 --> 04:16.547
The last girl you went out with was
a boat show model

04:16.632 --> 04:19.091
who posted pictures of yourjunk on Twitter.

04:20.135 --> 04:23.512
l'm so touched you recognize me
after all these years.

04:23.847 --> 04:26.807
But, Charlie, that's the kind of person
you're attracted to.

04:27.059 --> 04:31.145
l'm trying to change.
l'm trying to find someone more substantial.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.564
Look, l want you to be happy.
Don't you want me to be happy?

04:33.815 --> 04:35.816
l'm gonna be real honest with you, Charlie.

04:35.901 --> 04:38.319
l always want to be
just a little bit happier than you.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.074
Look, no matter what happens with Lori,

04:43.200 --> 04:45.326
l promise you,
as long as l have you in my life,

04:45.452 --> 04:47.203
l'll always be a little more
miserable than you.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.706
Charlie, that's so sweet.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.042
l am sweet. Help me share it.

04:53.418 --> 04:57.004
-Fine, l'll give her a call.
-Thank you.

04:57.089 --> 04:59.298
l won't screw up your business relationship.

04:59.383 --> 05:00.841
lf it doesn't go well with Lori, l promise

05:00.926 --> 05:02.718
l won't do donuts on her lawn
and call her a slut

05:02.803 --> 05:04.428
like l did when you and l
broke up in high school.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.974
That was you?
l was going with, like, three guys.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.768
That's what "slut" was about.

05:12.521 --> 05:15.064
And then last quarter,
we doubled gross profits again.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.774
We keep exceeding expectations.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.193
And so do you.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.404
l've got to tell you,
l think l'm doing great here tonight.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.197
l don't think l've ever been more charming.

05:24.866 --> 05:27.034
Wow. We've been here for four hours.

05:27.369 --> 05:28.452
l thought it was going to be 30 minutes

05:28.537 --> 05:30.079
and then straight
to the fake phone emergency.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.207
l've used that. What?

05:33.333 --> 05:35.459
Ten years in the Reserve,
and they're calling me up now?

05:37.963 --> 05:39.630
Jen was so wrong about you.

05:39.715 --> 05:43.426
She told me you were shallow and you'd
spend the whole night staring at my chest.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.012
Why would she say that?
Catch what l did there?

05:46.304 --> 05:49.098
Told a little joke
and l got to stare at your chest.

05:49.558 --> 05:51.809
l like how you just put it all out there.

05:51.893 --> 05:55.146
l feel like you get to a certain point,
and why waste time on a bunch of BS, right?

05:55.230 --> 05:57.565
Good point. Want to go back to my place?

05:58.233 --> 06:01.068
l'd love to. But not on the first date.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.863
We haven't even exchanged traumatic
high school dating stories yet.

06:03.947 --> 06:06.407
-l got dumped at prom.
-My boyfriend had a chain wallet.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.951
You win. Let's go back to my place.

06:09.244 --> 06:12.580
l wish l could. l have a meeting with
my investors in the morning.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.874
Yeah, l have an early group therapy
l have to prepare for anyway.

06:14.958 --> 06:18.586
Oh, that's right. You're a therapist.
Well, that must be fun.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.797
lt can be, but anything's fun
if you like what you do.

06:21.923 --> 06:25.593
Yeah, and what the hell? lf people
feel better when they leave, that's great.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.429
Well, that's what therapy does.

06:28.638 --> 06:32.224
l totally get it. My uncle was a magician.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.774
l'm free tomorrow night. Call me.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.908
A friggin' magician?

06:52.996 --> 06:56.373
-Hey, Charlie. Sam ready?
-l thought she was with you this week.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.293
-She hasn't been here all week?
-l'll be right down, Mom.

07:00.796 --> 07:02.129
l hate you.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.132
Well, then here's your opportunity
to get me back.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.635
-Did Lori call?
-Oh, yeah.

07:09.221 --> 07:10.846
And?

07:11.139 --> 07:13.432
She said she had a great time
and that you're funny.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.392
What did you put in her drink?

07:15.977 --> 07:17.478
She have any attitude about my job?

07:17.729 --> 07:19.313
'Cause we had a great time,
but at the very end

07:19.397 --> 07:20.981
she made a little crack
about what l do for a living.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.317
Oh, yeah, that.
She doesn't believe in therapy.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.402
That's what l thought. lt's crazy.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.364
Not really.
Lots of people don't believe in therapists.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.407
Lots of people think they're just a bunch
of big phonies

07:30.492 --> 07:32.409
who get paid to sit
and listen to whiny people

07:32.494 --> 07:36.122
who don't have the guts to get off
their asses and get their crap together.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.666
Wow, how long you been sitting on that?

07:41.670 --> 07:43.754
You look so beautiful, Lori.

07:43.839 --> 07:46.590
The food, the conversation,
it's all so perfect.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.884
l just don't want this night to end.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.803
To us.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.348
You know, l thought having a Skype
date was going to be creepy and weird.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.142
But you know what? lt really is.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.727
l know. l can't wait for you to get back.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.647
l'm looking forward to having it creepy
and weird with you in person.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.649
Well, you are in luck.

08:03.733 --> 08:04.859
As soon as I get back from Chicago,

08:04.943 --> 08:07.695
l think our next date might have
to include a toothbrush and pajamas.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.406
Now, l know you don't believe in therapy,

08:10.490 --> 08:13.951
but l think your healthy sexuality
is a result of a close-knit family

08:14.035 --> 08:15.369
that provided a safe environment.

08:15.871 --> 08:18.289
Whatever. l just want to have sex with you.

08:19.583 --> 08:20.833
Or that.

08:22.544 --> 08:25.045
l got to go. Fly safe. l'll see you Wednesday?

08:25.380 --> 08:27.965
-Can't wait. Good night.
-Okay, good night.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.725
Are you late for some sort of
business meeting in a swimming pool?

08:38.476 --> 08:40.728
ln fact, no. l just had a cyber date with Lori.

08:41.313 --> 08:45.274
Right, right. The entrepre-nutjob
who doesn't believe in therapy.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.859
You still chasing that rainbow?

08:47.444 --> 08:51.488
As a matter of fact, l am.
She's actually a very smart businesswoman,

08:51.573 --> 08:55.743
who happens to believe that my life's work
is equal to sawing a woman in half.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.828
Speaking of a lack of respect,

08:58.205 --> 09:00.623
l read a great paper on humiliation
this weekend

09:00.707 --> 09:02.791
-and it gave me some great ideas.
-No, no, l'm sorry.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.753
l'm sorry, sweetie, l can't. l can't.
l've got to invoke the rules.

09:06.922 --> 09:09.381
lf one party is in proximity
of a serious relationship,

09:09.466 --> 09:12.092
the other party must agree
to suspend sexual relations.

09:12.427 --> 09:16.347
Man, that has got to be the weirdest
document ever signed in front of a notary.

09:17.057 --> 09:20.100
Fine. Play this thing out.
We'll have sex on Thursday.

09:21.186 --> 09:24.563
Just because she doesn't believe in therapy
doesn't mean this relationship can't work.

09:24.648 --> 09:27.816
Fine. We'll have sex on Friday... Morning.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.861
No, no, l'm going to prove to her
that therapy is valid.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.197
And then we can begin a healthy
emotional relationship.

09:33.698 --> 09:36.617
Yes, and then we'll all hold hands

09:36.701 --> 09:39.745
and wish away hunger and war
and meanness between people.

09:39.955 --> 09:41.747
And then l'll see you for sex on Friday.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.125
You know, we could all hold hands
and wish away

09:45.210 --> 09:48.963
war and hunger anyway,
you dark, cynical bitch.

09:51.466 --> 09:54.301
Are you sure it's okay that l'm sitting
in on one of your sessions?

09:54.386 --> 09:55.719
Well, it's not really a session today.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.721
l invited a former patient
to come talk to the group

09:57.806 --> 09:59.807
about how successful
therapy's been for him.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.851
Oh, l think it's very sweet that you care
enough to try to convince me

10:02.936 --> 10:05.646
that you're not stealing from these people.

10:05.981 --> 10:08.148
Well, l do. Care, not steal.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.567
And l think it's very sweet
that you're pretending

10:10.652 --> 10:11.986
to be a person with an open mind.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.988
Well, l am. Pretending.

10:15.490 --> 10:20.661
So, basically, l lost 20 years of my life
to anger and self-sabotage.

10:21.371 --> 10:25.332
l lost my wife, my job and our home.

10:26.084 --> 10:31.547
But thanks to therapy and the tools
that this guy taught me,

10:32.048 --> 10:35.509
l mean, l was able to rebuild my life.
l mean, it's a miracle.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.972
Well, thank you, Rodney. But let's
not put me on the same level as God here.

10:40.056 --> 10:43.517
Just a regular guy who does godlike things.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.770
Charlie, is it okay if l ask something?

10:47.022 --> 10:49.732
-Shoot.
-l am really impressed, Rodney.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.443
So you don't get angry at all anymore?

10:52.902 --> 10:57.781
No, everybody gets angry.
l mean, you know, life is full of challenges.

10:58.325 --> 11:02.953
But with what l learned here in this group,
l'm able to manage my anger.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.457
Did you learn anything
about speeding up the process?

11:06.541 --> 11:09.960
Because it's costing me a small
fortune to eat Bagel Bites

11:10.045 --> 11:12.421
and listening to that
dot-head and this queer-doke

11:12.505 --> 11:14.381
call me a racist and a homophobe.

11:16.551 --> 11:19.887
He never calls me anything.
Just so you know, l'm half-Jewish.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.014
-What's the other half?
-French.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.308
l'll work on something.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.728
l have a question, too, Rodney.

11:28.563 --> 11:32.316
At your lowest point, did you ever feel like
you were being haunted by a ghost?

11:32.442 --> 11:33.776
-Because l've...
-Well said, Patrick.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.819
Don't we all have ghosts?

11:36.529 --> 11:39.698
So, Rodney, why don't you tell us
about the new woman in your life?

11:39.783 --> 11:41.575
l'd rather not.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.954
Sounds like trouble in paradise.
Hey, Frogstein?

11:47.582 --> 11:52.002
lt's either that or Surrenderburg.
l'm still working on it.

11:53.922 --> 11:56.423
ls the new girl leaving you, too?

11:57.175 --> 12:00.761
You know, l drove a long way
to come out here and help you guys.

12:01.304 --> 12:04.139
l would think that you might back off a little.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.892
Okay, l want to thank Rodney for his time.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.645
-And l wish him...
-She cheated on me, all right?

12:10.772 --> 12:13.649
They all do.
That's how they train them in hell.

12:15.652 --> 12:16.985
l'm sure Rodney has
somewhere to be right now.

12:17.070 --> 12:21.031
No, no, no. l can't check back into
the shelter for another two hours.

12:21.116 --> 12:22.449
l'm all yours.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.577
-What happened to yourjob?
-Nobody buys the paper anymore.

12:26.454 --> 12:31.125
Were you, like, a paperboy on a bicycle?
'Cause that's really funny.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.627
l wrote the Jumble.

12:34.796 --> 12:40.300
Why don't you tweet about that
to all the other cheating little whores?

12:40.760 --> 12:43.762
lt's okay. lt's okay, Rodney.
Breathe. Breathe.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.265
Help me out, buddy.
l'm trying to impress a girl here.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.103
You never think it's gonna be your brother.
You know?

12:51.604 --> 12:54.815
Then one day you walk in on them doing it

12:55.233 --> 12:57.860
on the table where you used
to write your Jumble.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.946
Punch the Bobo, Rodney.
Take out your anger on the Bobo.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.615
No, l'm calming down. l can feel it.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.201
You son of a bitch!

13:08.079 --> 13:12.833
l gave you a kidney and you stole my wife!

13:13.334 --> 13:15.919
You stupid rekufc.

13:16.379 --> 13:19.339
lt's a Jumble. Figure it out.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.011
-l'm gonna take off.
-Okay.

13:24.095 --> 13:25.804
Looks like you got your hands full here.

13:25.889 --> 13:28.223
Call me later. This is fun.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.689
Bobo's dead.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.446
And l really thought me and Lori
might have had something.

13:43.031 --> 13:46.825
l'm sorry, Charlie. Oh, look, it's Friday.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.746
You said morning. You were wrong. l win.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.125
l'm never gonna get it up tonight.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.794
l told you this would happen.

13:58.254 --> 14:01.673
My mom used to tell me a story
about a fish and a duck

14:01.758 --> 14:07.012
who tried to fall in love, but it wouldn't work
because they were so different.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.556
And their sexual organs wouldn't line up.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.185
There's more to it.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.729
l think a goose got involved.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.107
But the point is clear.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.237
lt's not even about Lori anymore.
Maybe l am a magician.

14:23.321 --> 14:26.740
Maybe therapy is just smoke and mirrors
that won't hold up in the long run.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.867
-Come here.
-l'm not in the mood.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.786
l'm not going to touch you.

14:30.954 --> 14:33.580
You said that before.
Every time l get in that bed, you touch me.

14:35.542 --> 14:39.878
l promise l'm not going to touch you.
l just want to make you feel better.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.380
Okay.

14:41.589 --> 14:46.176
But if you make me feel better,
then l'm going to want you to touch me.

14:46.261 --> 14:50.264
Charlie, you picked a profession
with lots of ups and downs.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.850
-And?
-That's all l got.

14:53.977 --> 14:55.686
l'm gonna touch you now.

15:00.275 --> 15:01.692
Hello?

15:02.277 --> 15:03.569
Patrick?

15:04.279 --> 15:06.780
ls it important? 'Cause l'm kind of busy.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.615
None of your business.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.452
All right. l'll be right there.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.329
Where are you going?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.540
Patrick's having a crisis with his mother.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.208
He says he's seeing her angry ghost.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.877
Well, l have a patient whose rabbit
gives him stock tips,

15:20.962 --> 15:23.130
but you don't see me going out
in the middle of the night.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.633
That's just what l do. You upset?

15:26.968 --> 15:31.138
No. You just wrecked my plans to get you
super horny and kick you out.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.808
lt's what us dark, cynical bitches do.

15:41.024 --> 15:43.066
Thank God you came.
l didn't know who else to call.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.569
My mother's ghost is really mad.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.905
She keeps rattling that lamp over there
and l don't know what she's angry about.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.365
How do we know it's your mother?

15:50.450 --> 15:54.369
Does she actually speak or is she more of a
traditional "Woo" kind of ghost?

15:54.746 --> 15:58.874
She's more like a "You're a disappointment.
l expected more" kind of ghost.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.669
ls there anything that happened
that she would be disappointed about?

16:03.004 --> 16:05.297
That woman would be
disappointed in a rainbow.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.841
"Stripes are very unflattering."

16:10.011 --> 16:12.220
-l mean recently.
-Well, she died.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.723
A lot of people have issues with that.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.142
l don't know what it is. She won't tell me.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.227
Maybe she'll tell me.

16:20.563 --> 16:23.815
-Hello, Patrick's mom.
-Don't say mom!

16:23.900 --> 16:25.108
She hated being called mom.

16:25.193 --> 16:27.694
She said it was very
inelegant to have children.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.989
You ever think about bringing that
up in therapy? lt's kind of a big point.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.994
Just call her Mona. And whatever you do,
don't tell her you love her.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.538
l wasn't planning on it.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.125
-Hello, Mona.
-Put on a British accent.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.670
All her lovers were British.

16:45.380 --> 16:46.713
l don't want to be her lover.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.591
lf you want her to answer, you just do it!

16:49.717 --> 16:50.842
Fine.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.056
'Ello, Mona.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.518
What, do you work at the docks?
Upscale British.

16:59.602 --> 17:03.939
Okay, no. l'm not doing this.
Let's think about what's making her angry.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.482
What were you doing
right before she appeared?

17:05.858 --> 17:07.818
l had a fight with Scott.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.736
Oh, my God.
Do you think this is about Scott?

17:10.238 --> 17:11.905
Why would Mona be angry about Scott?

17:12.740 --> 17:16.034
Well, maybe because she thinks
he moved in too soon?

17:16.119 --> 17:17.536
Ask her if she wants me
to tell him to move out.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.415
Why are we asking Mona?
ls that what you want?

17:21.708 --> 17:25.419
l don't know.
She always handled these things in my life.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.048
Your mother handled your relationships?

17:30.133 --> 17:31.800
Doesn't everybody's?

17:32.427 --> 17:35.762
No. Although, my mom tried to set me up
with my second cousin once.

17:35.847 --> 17:37.431
l had to draw a chart to show her
why it was wrong.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.015
But this isn't about me.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.686
lt sounds like you had a codependent
relationship with your mother.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.980
l don't know about codependent.

17:45.064 --> 17:48.900
She did make my decisions for me
and l was her only friend.

17:49.944 --> 17:52.195
Patrick, you're obviously upset
about Scott moving in

17:52.280 --> 17:54.865
and you're manifesting that
through your mother's ghost.

17:54.949 --> 17:59.369
-l think you know what you have to do.
-Adopt a baby to save the relationship.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.872
No, you might want to think
about living alone for a while

18:01.956 --> 18:03.623
and making your own decisions.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.876
That's part of the reason
you're passive-aggressive.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.878
You've never made your own choices.

18:08.171 --> 18:10.922
So you've always said what you really felt
out of the side of your mouth.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.091
So there's no Mona?

18:13.926 --> 18:15.051
No.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.846
Then how do you explain that?

18:19.140 --> 18:22.225
lt's right next to the vent and the
airjust kicked on.

18:24.479 --> 18:25.812
l moved it there yesterday.

18:26.105 --> 18:30.066
So l guess that's not my grandmother
in the dishwasher either.

18:31.194 --> 18:32.194
No.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.323
-l'll see you on Thursday.
-You're a good therapist.

18:38.493 --> 18:39.576
Thank you.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.748
Would you call what l do almost like magic?

18:44.999 --> 18:46.374
Not really.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.461
Good. Bye, Mona.

18:51.047 --> 18:54.299
-Okay, now you're just making fun of me.
-You got me there, matey.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.927
Okay, now you're just a pirate.

18:58.679 --> 19:01.473
And l realized the whole Rodney
thing was a disaster.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.601
But the next day l had a great breakthrough
with another one of my patients

19:04.685 --> 19:07.687
-and l realized l can't prove to you...
-Charlie. lt doesn't matter.

19:08.356 --> 19:11.399
l think it's really cute you tried,
but you don't have to prove anything to me.

19:11.484 --> 19:15.237
-l can get past it if you can.
-That's what l came here to tell you.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.948
l don't care if l'm a fish and you're a duck.

19:18.449 --> 19:21.868
l think if we work hard enough,
we can get our genitals to line up.

19:23.913 --> 19:27.374
Okay, that was weird.
But l get it and l agree.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.460
lt's like the great Paula Abdul once said,
"Opposites attract."

19:31.462 --> 19:34.381
-The great Paula Abdul?
-Wait, you don't like her?

19:35.508 --> 19:38.134
Well, sure l do.
But l reserve the word great for people like

19:38.219 --> 19:41.304
-Nelson Mandela and Mother Teresa.
-And Paula Abdul.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.475
So totally open-minded here.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.061
The breakthrough you had
with your patient, what was it?

19:48.354 --> 19:49.896
Nah, you're gonna think it's silly.

19:49.981 --> 19:53.441
l saw a guy beat up a plastic man with a log.
Just tell me.

19:53.734 --> 19:56.111
Okay. He thought he had a ghost.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.780
Really? So did he?

19:59.907 --> 20:01.157
Of course not.

20:02.743 --> 20:06.496
Because my aunt has one in her house
and l've always wanted to meet him.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.582
-So you believe in ghosts?
-Yeah.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.917
-But not in therapy?
-No.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.753
Okay, okay, okay. You know what?

20:13.838 --> 20:17.257
l don't believe in ghosts, you don't believe
in therapy, but we can get past that, too.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.634
We sure can. l'm Aquarius. l'm easygoing.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.930
-So you believe in astrology?
-l don't make a move without it.

20:24.265 --> 20:26.850
-But you don't believe in therapy?
-No.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.186
Okay, you know what? l don't care.
l like you, you like me.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.606
-Let's go back to my place.
-l knew you'd ask.

20:33.441 --> 20:36.318
-l'm a little psychic.
-Awesome.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.236
So then you know what we're gonna do.

20:38.696 --> 20:41.323
Yeah, l do. And by the way,

20:42.074 --> 20:43.491
l don't believe in birth control.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.292
Well, l made it to Saturday.
