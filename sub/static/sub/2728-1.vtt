00:28.528 --> 00:30.487
Man's voice:
My name is Lance clayton.

00:30.655 --> 00:33.699
My biggest fear in life is
that I'm going to end up all alone.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.160
I'm a writer.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.996
I'm a writer, but so far
nothing I've written

00:39.164 --> 00:41.540
has ever been published.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.042
Ernest Hemingway
once said

00:43.209 --> 00:46.587
all he wanted to do was
write one true sentence.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.131
He also tried to scratch
an itch on the back of his head

00:49.299 --> 00:50.632
with a shotgun.

00:54.429 --> 00:57.431
I've always dreamed
of being a famous author,

00:57.599 --> 00:59.767
of creating
an important work...

00:59.934 --> 01:02.728
# Ooh la la la la la la la #

01:02.896 --> 01:04.354
# La la la la la la #

01:04.522 --> 01:05.939
# Saa la la la la
la la la... #

01:06.107 --> 01:08.150
...something that connected
with people and helped them

01:08.318 --> 01:10.778
as they suffered through
the human condition...

01:10.945 --> 01:12.279
# Ooh la la la... #

01:12.447 --> 01:15.157
...also something that made
a shitload of cash.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.288
# Ooh la la la la la... #

01:24.709 --> 01:27.377
I've written novels,
books, magazine articles,

01:27.545 --> 01:29.171
and even
children's stories.

01:29.339 --> 01:32.216
All have been rejected.

01:32.383 --> 01:35.803
I did sell a few
greeting cards once, though.

01:37.555 --> 01:38.931
It felt pretty good.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.474
I don't find
the creative process

01:40.642 --> 01:42.768
in itself rewarding enough.

01:42.936 --> 01:46.855
I have to be honest...
I want to reach an audience.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.358
This is my fifth novel.

01:49.526 --> 01:52.569
I've promised myself that
if this one is rejected,

01:52.737 --> 01:54.404
I'll give up writing.

02:06.751 --> 02:09.294
Come on, boy, we're late.

02:10.463 --> 02:13.048
Hey, buddy, I...

02:13.216 --> 02:14.591
Kyle?

02:14.759 --> 02:16.802
Oh, fuc...
what the fuck?

02:16.970 --> 02:19.847
- God! Kyle?
- D-Dad?

02:20.014 --> 02:22.015
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

02:22.183 --> 02:25.519
- God, I was coming, you fag!
- Jesus christ.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.771
- I thought you were dead.
- Do you knock? Please!

02:27.939 --> 02:29.481
I knocked.
Okay, yep.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.525
- Out!
- God, I...

02:31.693 --> 02:33.527
- Get out of my room!
- I'm out. I'm going.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.654
- I'm out of here.
- You ever heard of privacy?

02:35.822 --> 02:37.531
- You freak!
- Yeah, I'm the weird one.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.533
Yeah. Oh, God.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.910
What the fuck?

02:49.085 --> 02:54.840
Dad?

02:55.008 --> 02:57.467
- Dad!
- Oh, yeah. Right.

03:01.639 --> 03:04.516
Radio: # What do you do?
Where do you go? #

03:08.021 --> 03:10.689
You were up early.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.985
- You're not funny.
- Okay.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.154
What a Monday.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.200
# Somewhere else... #

03:21.367 --> 03:23.493
Why are we
listening to this?

03:23.661 --> 03:25.662
'Cause I like
Bruce Hornsby.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.838
Stop it.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.926
Bruce Hornsby is a fag.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.595
- He's got kids, Kyle.
- You have a kid.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.096
- Mmm.
- And you're a fag.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.599
- Why? Because I like Bruce Hornsby?
- Yeah.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.184
Well, put on some music
you like. Okay?

03:47.352 --> 03:48.685
No, I fucking hate music.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.187
- You hate music?
- Yeah.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.606
- All music?
- Yes.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.776
The only thing queerer than music
are the people who like it.

03:55.944 --> 03:58.445
All music is gay now?
What about heavy metal?

03:58.613 --> 04:02.449
That's probably the faggiest
of all the fag music out there.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.618
Kyle, you could have
died this morning.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.621
Well...
of embarrassment.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.581
What you're doing
is dangerous.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.708
What? Beating off?

04:11.876 --> 04:14.628
No no... not...
we all have needs, Kyle.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.213
Needs? What...
what are you talking about?

04:16.380 --> 04:17.714
Masturbation is natural, okay?

04:17.882 --> 04:19.298
- You know what's not natural?
- What?

04:19.466 --> 04:22.219
Talking about jerking off
with your dad. That's not natural.

04:22.387 --> 04:23.720
- Shit.
- Don't do that, please, okay?

04:23.888 --> 04:26.306
- Why?
- Because your feet are dirty.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.768
Because I said so.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.322
- Whoa, let me out here.
- Let me park in the lot.

04:42.490 --> 04:45.617
Lance, I'm gonna look like a dillweed
walking in with you, all right?

04:45.785 --> 04:47.452
It's bad for my rep.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.037
Don't call me Lance.

04:49.205 --> 04:51.957
It's your name,
isn't it? Lance?

04:52.125 --> 04:55.377
# What do you do?
Where do you go? #

04:55.545 --> 04:57.713
# What do you say? #

04:57.880 --> 05:00.340
# And how do you know? #

05:00.508 --> 05:02.759
# I'll say who cares #

05:02.927 --> 05:04.761
# When people stare #

05:04.929 --> 05:09.016
# I will make myself
invisible #

05:09.183 --> 05:12.561
# Yes, I will, yes, I will #

05:12.729 --> 05:17.107
# Mm-hmm #

05:17.275 --> 05:19.067
# Mm-hmm hmm... #

05:19.235 --> 05:21.320
Slow down, boys.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.822
# When I feel like a freak... #

05:23.990 --> 05:25.574
'Morning.

05:25.742 --> 05:30.287
# When I'm on the other end
of someone's mean streak #

05:30.455 --> 05:33.749
# People make fun,
I've got to lose myself... #

05:33.916 --> 05:35.250
Danny.

05:35.418 --> 05:39.338
# Take my thin skin
and move it somewhere else #

05:39.505 --> 05:43.008
# I'm setting myself up
for the future #

05:43.176 --> 05:48.138
# Looking for the chance that something
good might lie ahead #

05:49.682 --> 05:52.351
# I guess I'm looking
for the possibilities #

05:52.518 --> 05:53.894
# And in my mind #

05:54.062 --> 05:57.147
# I've got this skin
I can shed... #

05:57.315 --> 05:58.774
# What do you do? #

05:58.941 --> 06:00.275
# Where do you go? #

06:00.443 --> 06:02.694
- Good morning, Lance.
- 'Morning Principal Anderson.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.613
- What was that?
- Oh, personal mail,

06:04.781 --> 06:06.239
but I used
my own postage.

06:06.407 --> 06:08.450
- Mmm. Good.
- Right.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.369
May I speak with you
for a moment?

06:10.536 --> 06:12.162
Sure.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.539
Your poetry course...

06:14.707 --> 06:16.375
it's not very popular.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.960
- Neither is poetry, sir.
- Mmm.

06:19.128 --> 06:21.171
But the few who take it,
they get a lot out of it.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.131
Yes yes,
I'm sure they do.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.384
But I am sorry...
if your class enrollment

06:25.551 --> 06:28.178
doesn't improve by next semester,
we're going to have to drop it.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.639
We're only budgeted
for one English elective,

06:30.807 --> 06:34.184
and Mike Lane's creative-writing
course is quite the hit.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.311
I just wanted to give you
a heads up.

06:36.479 --> 06:37.896
Well, thank you, sir.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.193
- Hey, what's going on, Mr. L?
- Hey, how you doin', man?

06:43.361 --> 06:44.736
- Good. How are you?
- Ready for tonight's game?

06:44.904 --> 06:46.238
- Yeah, you gonna be there?
- I'll be there. Of course.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.948
- Good.
- Throw a touchdown for me, all right?

06:48.116 --> 06:49.950
- Of course!
- Hey, Lancelot!

06:50.118 --> 06:51.743
- What's up, buddy?
- Not much, Mike.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.870
All right.

06:54.038 --> 06:55.914
'Morning, Miss Reed.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.999
- Hello, Mr. Clayton.
- How are you?

06:58.167 --> 07:00.293
- Good. How are you?
- Mmm.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.465
Ahh, my favorite.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.467
I thought teachers weren't
supposed to have favorites.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.302
Not favorite students.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.269
I'm a lucky guy.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.354
How does a lump like me
get a dame like you?

07:19.522 --> 07:21.857
Don't insult my taste.
I'm the lucky guy.

07:25.027 --> 07:26.778
You finished?

07:26.946 --> 07:29.364
Yeah. I wanted you to be
the first to read it.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.532
I'm honored.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.867
Really?

07:32.034 --> 07:34.244
Maybe I'll take you
someplace fancy for dinner.

07:34.412 --> 07:37.247
How about you come over to my place
for something hot and spicy?

07:37.415 --> 07:39.291
- Is that a double entendre?
- No.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.876
- I was just going to make you my chili.
- Oh.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.210
And then bang you.

07:42.378 --> 07:44.504
Great!

07:44.672 --> 07:46.548
You have a very
professional day, Miss Reed.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.008
Right back at you,
Mr. Clayton.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.886
- Take care.
- Extremely professional day.

07:53.431 --> 07:56.516
Andrew, I want
to show you something.

07:56.684 --> 07:59.019
What is it?

07:59.187 --> 08:01.229
Ew, is that woman
being crapped on?

08:01.397 --> 08:03.690
Happy birthday.
It's fucking German schizer porn.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.901
All right, dude?
It's fucking hot, right, yo?

08:06.068 --> 08:08.445
No, dude, what the fuck
is wrong with you, yo?

08:08.613 --> 08:10.113
Nothing.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.616
You wouldn't say that
if you lived in Europe.

08:12.783 --> 08:15.035
I mean, these Europeans
are much more broadminded

08:15.203 --> 08:17.787
than these uptight Americans.
Shit's huge in Germany.

08:17.955 --> 08:20.707
Yeah, well, we're not in Europe
and I don't like that kind of stuff.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.001
Yeah, I know,
that's 'cause you're a fag.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.836
Dude, it's gross.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.172
I'd do it...

08:27.340 --> 08:28.673
to someone.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.342
- Oh.
- I would.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.844
I'd chili-dog her.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.679
Hi, Jennifer.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.683
Come on, baby,
that pussy's not gonna eat itself.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.686
What the fuck
did you just say?

08:41.854 --> 08:44.356
Uh, nothing.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.608
You're a fucking pig.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.653
Wow, okay.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.530
Hold that.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.916
Get off me, you dumb jock!

09:03.084 --> 09:05.168
What are you talking about?
I don't even play sports.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.753
- You...
- Hey!

09:06.921 --> 09:09.839
Come on, guys, knock it off.
Knock it off.

09:10.007 --> 09:12.592
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right, bitch.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.096
Oh, you're gonna help me up?

09:16.264 --> 09:20.100
- Come on.
- Can't you control that animal?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.562
Now come on,
tough guy, let's go.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.564
Let's go, guys.
Come on.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.693
Principal: Kyle,

09:29.860 --> 09:31.361
what did you say
to Jennifer?

09:31.529 --> 09:33.613
Nothing.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.701
He said that her pussy
is not going to eat itself.

09:37.868 --> 09:39.411
Do you hear that?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.329
You are... that is rude.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.164
- And you're a pervert.
- Be quiet.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.083
Kyle, is that
what you said?

09:45.251 --> 09:47.669
No.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.963
Jennifer, chris,
get back to class.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.799
Kyle, I need to speak
with you and your father.

10:01.642 --> 10:05.395
Kyle, right now you're
on academic probation

10:05.563 --> 10:07.731
and your grades show
no sign of improvement.

10:07.898 --> 10:09.316
If you don't straighten up,

10:09.483 --> 10:11.526
I'm going
to have to expel you.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.863
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Mr. Anderson.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.198
I do understand.

10:17.366 --> 10:20.577
Now get out of here.
And no more trouble.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.079
Wait for me outside.

10:30.254 --> 10:32.088
Lance,

10:32.256 --> 10:34.090
this isn't easy for me.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.967
What isn't easy,
Mr. Anderson?

10:36.135 --> 10:37.677
How's Kyle been acting
at home?

10:37.845 --> 10:40.930
I mean, does he seem
normal to you?

10:41.098 --> 10:43.933
Oh, yeah.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.561
Oh. You and I both know
that sometimes

10:46.729 --> 10:49.105
these things take
a long time to surface.

10:49.273 --> 10:50.940
What things?

10:51.108 --> 10:53.610
Well, I think that Kyle's
poor grades and acting out

10:53.778 --> 10:55.737
show signs of a serious
development problem.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.781
He belongs in
a special-needs school

10:57.948 --> 11:00.492
where he can get the proper attention
and care that he requires.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.160
- What?
- That's nothing to be ashamed of.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.163
Sir, he's... he's not slow.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.748
He's just being a pain.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.291
Give him another chance.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.960
Well, I have.
I've given him many chances.

11:11.128 --> 11:13.463
That's true.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.517
All right.

11:25.685 --> 11:29.312
All right, but he'd better start showing
signs of improvement and quickly.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.940
And he's got to stop
disturbing the other students.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.275
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

11:34.443 --> 11:36.194
Thank you.

11:37.446 --> 11:39.823
- You're grounded.
- I'll run away.

11:39.990 --> 11:41.491
Oh, and live
with your mother?

11:41.659 --> 11:43.159
And her boy-toy Todd?
That's a great idea.

11:43.327 --> 11:44.869
- I'll take away your computer.
- No, you won't.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.163
Yes, I will.
Jesus christ, Kyle,

11:47.331 --> 11:49.290
what did I do
to deserve this?

11:49.458 --> 11:51.209
I didn't ask to be born.

11:51.377 --> 11:54.003
Neither did I.

11:54.171 --> 11:56.089
Boo hoo.

11:57.466 --> 11:59.551
Woman:
You are so funny!

11:59.719 --> 12:02.053
Wait, read from here.
Starting there.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.347
- What are you reading?
- "We don't experience it

12:04.515 --> 12:05.724
as a restriction!"

12:05.891 --> 12:09.144
- What's that?
- Oh, God, you are so funny.

12:09.311 --> 12:11.146
It's... come here.
Give it to me.

12:11.313 --> 12:13.398
- Oh, this is embarrassing.
- Mike got published

12:13.566 --> 12:15.316
- in "The New Yorker. "
- "New Yorker"!

12:15.484 --> 12:16.901
- Hello!
- "The New Yorker"?

12:17.069 --> 12:19.362
Woman: It's about
the first robot that joins the NBA.

12:19.530 --> 12:22.407
- It's like a parody about racism.
- Miss Reed: Racism.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.576
- It's hysterical.
- No, it isn't.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.203
No, it is seriously so good.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.247
Called "I, Forward. "
Get it?

12:29.415 --> 12:31.583
Yeah, like "I, Robot. "

12:31.751 --> 12:33.418
- Right, but "I, Forward. "
- Yeah.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.587
It's... it's really hard
getting in "The New Yorker. "

12:35.755 --> 12:37.005
- It is?
- Yeah, really.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.506
It's the first thing
I submitted.

12:38.674 --> 12:40.258
Woman: That's amaz...
I'm amazed.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.427
The first thing? No.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.555
- That's great. Good for you.
- What's that?

12:45.723 --> 12:47.474
Mike got published
in "The New Yorker. "

12:47.641 --> 12:49.267
You don't say!
May I see it?

12:49.435 --> 12:51.144
- Sure.
- It's about racism.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.938
Hot dog! Now don't go
getting too famous on us.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.690
What's that?

12:55.858 --> 12:57.484
Mike published an article
in "The New Yorker. "

12:57.651 --> 12:59.652
- Take a look at that.
- Ho ho!

12:59.820 --> 13:02.280
Right on.
You dog, you dog!

13:02.448 --> 13:04.491
Yeah!

13:04.658 --> 13:06.284
This should be read
at assembly.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.786
Now that is a great idea.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.621
Mike, would you read it
at the assembly?

13:09.789 --> 13:11.498
If you twist my arm,
all right.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.167
May I take this
with me?

13:14.335 --> 13:15.835
- Yeah, sure.
- Can I read it after him?

13:16.003 --> 13:17.295
That's awesome.
Congratulations.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.963
Hey, blow my whistle.
Come on... "The New Yorker"!

13:19.131 --> 13:21.216
For "The New Yorker"!
Yeah!

13:23.969 --> 13:27.472
Wow, I cannot wait
to get my own copy.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.518
"New Yorker. "
It's not a national,

13:31.685 --> 13:34.145
- but that's amazing.
- No.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.272
Actually, it is
a national magazine.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.774
- It's national.
- Really?

13:37.942 --> 13:39.609
Whoa, I didn't know that.

13:39.777 --> 13:40.777
Mmm.

13:40.945 --> 13:41.986
How's Kyle?

13:42.154 --> 13:43.988
Great.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.366
Raising a son is so hard.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.410
Don't get me wrong, my Hunter is
the best thing that ever happened to me.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.579
But man, can he be a handful.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.832
- How old is he?
- Two, going on 20.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.458
Oh, God.

13:55.626 --> 13:56.709
The kid's a player.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.336
Well, I wonder where
he gets that from.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.421
I have no idea.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.674
How's he dealing
with the separation?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.592
Real well.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.095
I didn't know
you were separated.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.097
Yeah.
It's been tough,

14:09.265 --> 14:12.767
but his mother and I were supposed
to make a baby together.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.061
We just weren't supposed
to live together.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.230
- That's so sad.
- Yeah.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.440
Thanks.

14:19.608 --> 14:22.110
How often do you see him?

14:22.278 --> 14:23.987
Every other weekend.

14:24.154 --> 14:27.073
They're not kidding when
they say that raising a child

14:27.241 --> 14:29.826
is the toughest job
you'll ever love.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.495
Mmm. Well, you sound
like a great dad.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.873
Ah, well,

14:35.040 --> 14:36.916
I try my best.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.015
Hi, Andrew.

14:52.182 --> 14:53.683
Hey.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.185
I enjoy our little chats.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.480
Woman's voice:
Oh, yeah.

14:59.648 --> 15:01.900
- Kyle?
- Hi... hi, Dad.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.485
- What are you doing?
- What? Nothing.

15:04.653 --> 15:06.195
What's Andrew doing here?

15:06.363 --> 15:09.240
What, Andr... don't bother
Andrew, all right? He has asthma.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.034
Then he shouldn't be
having milk products.

15:11.201 --> 15:13.703
- What?
- Listen, you're grounded.

15:13.871 --> 15:17.081
- Send him home.
- I can't send him home, Dad!

15:17.249 --> 15:18.833
God, man, you never
listen to me.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.585
I told you,
he doesn't have a father

15:20.753 --> 15:22.337
and he has a mother
who's an alcoholic.

15:22.504 --> 15:24.172
Kyle, send him home. You don't get
to have friends over.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.174
Fine, you know what?
You can send him home.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.217
I'm not gonna do that
to this guy.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.762
Okay? You don't care about
anyone but yourself.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.430
- Kyle?
- You're so... what?

15:32.598 --> 15:35.391
- What do you want?
- Do you want to do some homework?

15:35.559 --> 15:37.477
I would love to, but I can't.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.103
You have to go home.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.647
Why?

15:40.814 --> 15:43.524
Oh, well, that's a question
for my father.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.568
Fine, Andrew can stay.
You can do homework.

15:45.736 --> 15:46.945
Oh, you can stay now!
You can...

15:47.112 --> 15:48.404
go on, get in. Shut up.

15:48.572 --> 15:50.323
Oh, you're gonna tell me
to shut up now.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.033
- Yeah, I am.
- Prick.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.870
Mr. Clayton, do you
have anything to eat?

15:56.038 --> 15:57.705
Sure, Andrew.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.000
Uh, I'm a vegetarian.

16:05.589 --> 16:07.423
Here you go, Andrew.
It's just cheese.

16:07.591 --> 16:08.883
I hope you're okay
with that.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.677
- Be careful. It's hot.
- Thanks, Mr. Clayton.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.220
Kyle, let's see
how much you've got here.

16:12.388 --> 16:15.848
Oh, online. Well,
"Farmers relied on good soil,

16:16.016 --> 16:18.226
worker animals,
sunshine and...

16:18.394 --> 16:19.644
perspiration. "

16:19.812 --> 16:21.229
You mean like sweat?

16:21.397 --> 16:23.940
No, perspiration...
when it rains!

16:24.108 --> 16:26.067
Uh, that's...
that's precipitation.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.111
No, I meant "sweat. "

16:28.278 --> 16:29.445
Oh.

16:29.613 --> 16:31.823
It's hot. You want
something to drink, Andrew?

16:31.991 --> 16:32.949
No.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.242
You okay?

16:34.410 --> 16:35.868
I'm trying to write.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.453
- Sorry.
- Please.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.455
Hello?

16:39.623 --> 16:40.832
- Lance: Hey.
- Hi.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.126
As soon as I finish helping Kyle
with his homework,

16:43.293 --> 16:46.462
I'm coming over to your house
and putting my penis in your vagina.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.799
That's a single entendre.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.801
Oh, I should have
called you earlier.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.178
I didn't get to the store
so I didn't make chili.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.848
Oh. Well, I'll
take you out to dinner.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.558
Oh, I don't know
if that's a good idea.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.560
I mean, we really shouldn't go out
where students might see us.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.479
Well, you know what? I'll pick up
some takeout and bring it over.

17:03.647 --> 17:07.650
Oh, would you just hate me
if we did this tomorrow night instead?

17:07.818 --> 17:10.486
I'm just not feeling that great,
and it's already kind of late.

17:10.654 --> 17:14.281
No. No, tomorrow
night'll be great.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.491
Okay.

17:15.659 --> 17:17.617
Are you sure you're
not mad at me?

17:17.786 --> 17:19.537
No, not at all.

17:19.704 --> 17:20.788
Okay.

17:20.955 --> 17:22.415
Then good night, sugar.

17:22.583 --> 17:23.790
Good night, popsicle.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.470
Let's see how you're doing
on that report, huh?

17:36.680 --> 17:38.765
- It's good.
- Yeah.

17:38.932 --> 17:40.433
See, Kyle?

17:40.601 --> 17:42.185
What are you doing?

17:42.352 --> 17:44.187
- Cool down.
- Oh.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.355
What time do you
have to be home, Andrew?

17:46.523 --> 17:47.523
It doesn't matter.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.275
Well, you know,
it's just 9:30.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.444
We can go to a video store,
get a movie.

17:51.612 --> 17:54.530
Are you stupid?
I hate watching movies.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.532
You used to like watching
movies when you were a kid.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.534
Yeah, only 'cause
you wanted me to.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.995
Movies are for losers
and art fags.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.790
Oh.
What would you like to do?

18:03.957 --> 18:06.167
Um...

18:06.335 --> 18:09.128
can Andrew and I play "Doom"
on my computer?

18:10.130 --> 18:11.881
Yeah.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.050
Just "Doom," nothing else.

18:19.598 --> 18:20.807
I like your dad.

18:20.974 --> 18:22.183
My dad?

18:22.351 --> 18:24.227
He's a fucking idiot.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.438
Boy:
"Insanity laughs

18:27.606 --> 18:31.025
Under pressure we're cracking

18:31.193 --> 18:34.862
can't we give ourselves
one more chance?

18:35.030 --> 18:37.740
Why can't we give love

18:37.908 --> 18:39.909
One more chance?

18:41.328 --> 18:43.746
Why can't we give love

18:43.914 --> 18:46.457
Give love

18:48.085 --> 18:49.794
Give love... "

18:49.962 --> 18:51.420
Stop.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.422
Jason, you didn't
write that.

18:53.590 --> 18:56.592
That's a Queen/Bowie song:
"Under Pressure. "

18:56.760 --> 18:58.427
What were you thinking?

18:58.595 --> 19:00.680
I didn't think
you knew that one.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.598
Jason, I'm white.

19:02.766 --> 19:04.267
- Oh, boy.
- Sit down.

19:04.434 --> 19:05.852
Thank you.

19:07.354 --> 19:10.439
Guys, why are you here
if you're not gonna even try?

19:10.607 --> 19:13.609
Poetry is about saying
something from your heart,

19:13.777 --> 19:16.320
something personal.
Okay?

19:16.488 --> 19:17.613
Yes, Ginger?

19:17.781 --> 19:20.283
I have something
that's kind of personal.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.285
Great. Go ahead.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.171
"It was raining
yesterday afternoon

19:33.338 --> 19:36.966
Water dripping off the lilac bushes
my mother loves

19:37.134 --> 19:40.803
And as I sat and watched the blood
pour out from between my legs

19:40.971 --> 19:43.264
And felt the pain
of motherhood myself

19:43.432 --> 19:46.434
I wondered if it would have
been a boy or a girl. "

19:52.107 --> 19:53.566
Thank you.

19:54.651 --> 19:57.570
That was very personal.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.407
Thanks.

20:01.575 --> 20:04.493
If you ever need to talk
to someone, I'm here.

20:04.661 --> 20:07.079
Why?

20:09.791 --> 20:11.834
Woman singing:
# Yes, it's a good day #

20:12.002 --> 20:13.419
# For singing a song #

20:13.587 --> 20:15.171
# And it's a good day #

20:15.339 --> 20:16.505
# For moving along #

20:16.673 --> 20:18.049
# Yes, it's a good day #

20:18.217 --> 20:20.092
# How could anything
be wrong? #

20:20.260 --> 20:22.720
# A good day
from morning till night #

20:22.888 --> 20:25.181
# And it's a good day #

20:25.349 --> 20:26.682
# For shining your shoes #

20:26.850 --> 20:28.434
# And it's a good day... #

20:28.602 --> 20:30.269
Hello, lamb chop.

20:30.437 --> 20:32.396
Hello, honeydew melon.

20:32.564 --> 20:34.106
What's wrong?

20:34.274 --> 20:35.524
Nothing.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.151
Something's bothering you.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.570
Do you like Mike?

20:39.738 --> 20:41.697
What are you talking about?

20:41.865 --> 20:43.574
Don't get mad. I mean,
I know we've never talked

20:43.742 --> 20:45.868
about not seeing
anyone else.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.537
I'm sorry I said that.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.039
L...

20:52.251 --> 20:53.793
are we still on for dinner?

20:53.961 --> 20:57.672
# I've got a gal
that's always late #

20:57.839 --> 21:00.383
# Every time we have a date #

21:00.550 --> 21:02.927
# But I love her #

21:03.095 --> 21:06.222
# Yes, I love her #

21:08.141 --> 21:11.852
# I'm gonna walk right up
to her gate #

21:12.020 --> 21:14.355
# And see
if I can get it straight #

21:14.523 --> 21:17.733
# 'cause I want her #

21:17.901 --> 21:20.987
# I'm gonna ask her #

21:21.154 --> 21:25.324
# I'm gonna say,
"Is you is or is you ain't #

21:25.492 --> 21:27.451
# My baby? #

21:29.246 --> 21:33.416
# The way you're acting
lately makes me doubt... " #

21:35.794 --> 21:38.296
- Hello?
- Miss Reed: Hello, jerk.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.298
I am so sorry.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.091
Yeah, you're
a real shitbird.

21:42.259 --> 21:43.592
Don't let it
happen again.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.636
I am such a jerk.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.763
And it will never
happen again.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.685
# Mmm, a woman
is a creature... #

21:52.853 --> 21:55.104
- Hello?
- I'm in here!

21:55.272 --> 21:57.440
# That has always been
strange #

21:57.607 --> 21:59.900
# Just when you're
sure of one #

22:00.068 --> 22:04.030
# You find she's gone
and made a change... #

22:04.197 --> 22:05.948
Oh, great. Thanks.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.575
# Is you is or is you ain't... #

22:07.743 --> 22:08.951
That's great.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.536
It's an interesting piece.

22:10.704 --> 22:13.247
- Yeah? You're an interesting piece.
- Oh!

22:19.296 --> 22:21.380
This is just
like high school, right?

22:21.548 --> 22:24.133
Ah. Except I didn't have
any girlfriends in high school.

22:24.301 --> 22:26.135
Oh, well, those girls
were idiots.

22:26.303 --> 22:27.928
I would have
been your girlfriend.

22:28.096 --> 22:29.388
Oh.

22:29.556 --> 22:31.307
If we had a time machine,

22:31.475 --> 22:32.975
let's see...

22:33.143 --> 22:34.310
mmm...

22:34.478 --> 22:36.979
I'd be in high school
and you'd be a fetus.

22:37.147 --> 22:38.898
- I think that's...
- No, that's not cool.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.232
No, not cool.

22:42.486 --> 22:43.361
Ala la la la.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.653
Girl:
Weekend summary:

22:44.821 --> 22:46.822
We did nothing,
followed by nothing,

22:46.990 --> 22:48.991
with a grand finale
of nothing.

22:49.159 --> 22:51.535
About time, Felter.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.913
I think they're doing it.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.456
What?

22:55.624 --> 22:57.958
You... you think
that they're fucking?

22:58.126 --> 22:59.585
Andrew, Andrew, look,

22:59.753 --> 23:02.129
you have to know that fucking pussy
is virgin shit, all right?

23:02.297 --> 23:04.548
When I'm with a bitch,
I just go straight for the brown-eye.

23:04.716 --> 23:07.718
- What?
- I stick my cock in her asshole.

23:07.886 --> 23:10.805
I got that part, but you've never
been with a woman.

23:10.972 --> 23:12.056
Fuck you.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.557
Kyle, I'm always with you.
I know.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.142
No, you're not always with me.

23:15.310 --> 23:16.644
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

23:17.979 --> 23:19.605
Loser.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.649
Oh, you're fucking fucked!

23:21.817 --> 23:24.860
- You're fucking...
- Let it go, Kyle. They're not worth it.

23:25.028 --> 23:27.863
"Aha," yeah. That's right,
laugh it up, you fucking whores.

23:32.077 --> 23:35.538
Don't be shy.

23:35.705 --> 23:37.873
There you go.

23:38.041 --> 23:40.334
Ahh, yeah.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.378
Oh.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.004
Lance:
Hey, buddy, what you doin'?

23:44.172 --> 23:46.549
I'm doing my homework.
What does it look like I'm doing?

23:46.716 --> 23:47.716
Oh.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.095
What?

23:51.263 --> 23:53.639
Nothing. Need a hand?

23:53.807 --> 23:56.350
You know, your report, or...

23:56.518 --> 23:59.687
No. No, it's... no.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.105
Okay.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.941
Hey, listen, I'm going
on a date tonight.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.944
And if you're hungry, I could fix you
some food before I go.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.946
You're going on a date
with who?

24:09.114 --> 24:10.614
Well, no one's
supposed to know

24:10.782 --> 24:12.741
because it could cause
problems at school.

24:12.909 --> 24:14.243
Claire.

24:14.411 --> 24:16.412
Claire?

24:16.580 --> 24:18.122
Do I know this claire?

24:18.290 --> 24:20.166
Miss Reed. Hmm?

24:20.333 --> 24:23.544
Really? You're going out
with the TILF, that's great.

24:23.712 --> 24:24.962
- The what?
- TILF...

24:25.130 --> 24:27.381
- "Teacher I'd like to fuck. "
- Nice mouth.

24:27.549 --> 24:29.717
Hey, it's just what the other
kids at school call her.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.469
What do you think
about Miss Reed?

24:31.636 --> 24:34.680
Well, she's got a hot body,
helmet's okay.

24:34.848 --> 24:37.057
- Do her from behind.
- Hey, come on now!

24:37.225 --> 24:39.268
Kyle, when did you become
such a pervert?

24:39.436 --> 24:40.769
You sound like
your uncle Pete.

24:40.937 --> 24:42.354
There's more
to a woman than that.

24:42.522 --> 24:43.898
What do you think about
her personality?

24:44.065 --> 24:47.151
Oh, um, nah.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.487
She's pretty stuck-up
and she's a phony.

24:49.654 --> 24:52.406
Why do I even
tell you these things?

25:01.583 --> 25:03.083
- Hello?
- Hey.

25:03.251 --> 25:06.128
- Hi.
- We still on for some vittles?

25:06.296 --> 25:08.380
Oh, I'm so sorry
I didn't call you sooner.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.424
My mother is having
a nervous breakdown.

25:10.592 --> 25:13.886
Her dog got burnt
by a hair crimper.

25:14.054 --> 25:17.056
They were playing fetch or something...
she's fucking bananas.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.224
Ahh.

25:18.391 --> 25:20.392
I'm so sorry about tonight.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.019
You're not mad, are you?

25:22.187 --> 25:23.312
Mmm, not at all.

25:23.480 --> 25:26.106
Okay, good night, cupcakes.

25:26.274 --> 25:28.275
Good night,
watermelon sherbet.

25:36.117 --> 25:39.912
# When I get high #

25:40.080 --> 25:44.333
# This world's so nice #

25:44.501 --> 25:48.128
# When I get high #

25:48.296 --> 25:51.924
# It's paradise... #

25:54.594 --> 25:57.096
Your pot smells like shit.

25:57.264 --> 25:59.974
- Oh. Oh, sorry.
- That's okay.

26:00.141 --> 26:02.476
- Would you like some?
- Are you kidding?

26:02.644 --> 26:05.229
I can barely breathe.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.273
Oh, I'm really sorry.
Oh.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.902
However,

26:12.070 --> 26:14.488
if you were to offer me
some pot brownies,

26:14.656 --> 26:15.990
I wouldn't say no.

26:16.157 --> 26:18.534
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:18.702 --> 26:22.037
Tonight when you're
getting changed,

26:22.205 --> 26:24.707
would you mind pulling
your bedroom drapes?

26:24.874 --> 26:26.333
Why?

26:26.501 --> 26:28.460
I think my son watches you.

26:28.628 --> 26:30.004
Get out of here.

26:30.171 --> 26:33.090
No no. I think
he watches you change.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.092
Your son?

26:35.260 --> 26:36.343
Mm-hmm.

26:36.511 --> 26:37.970
I thought he was a zombie.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.763
I wish. I like zombies.

26:39.931 --> 26:42.182
Oh, yeah, you do?
Me too. I do.

26:42.350 --> 26:43.726
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:43.893 --> 26:46.520
Oh, I like the early zombie movies
like "Night of the Living Dead. "

26:46.688 --> 26:50.065
- Me too.
- Oh, yeah, don't watch that one alone.

26:50.233 --> 26:51.775
- I don't like the new ones.
- No.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.278
- Zombies are too fast, you know?
- Yeah, too fast. Yeah.

26:54.446 --> 26:57.364
I believe, like Simon Pegg said,
that death is an impediment,

26:57.532 --> 26:58.824
not an energy drink.

27:24.517 --> 27:25.434
What you doing?

27:25.602 --> 27:28.312
Jesus, Dad.
You almost made me crap.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.857
Did you get
your homework done?

27:32.025 --> 27:33.859
Yeah, a long time ago.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.027
Yeah.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.446
- Yeah.
- What...

27:37.614 --> 27:39.448
are you stoned?

27:39.616 --> 27:40.824
No.

27:40.992 --> 27:43.369
Seriously, you smell like pot.
Are you smoking pot?

27:43.536 --> 27:45.204
- No.
- You can tell me.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.623
- No.
- You're not using grass?

27:47.791 --> 27:50.125
No, you don't use grass.
No.

27:50.293 --> 27:52.127
Then what's...
what's that smell?

27:52.295 --> 27:53.712
What smell?

27:53.880 --> 27:56.632
It's probably a skunk outside
or something, you know.

27:56.800 --> 27:57.758
Oh yeah, sure, a skunk.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.760
Hey, you know what?

27:59.928 --> 28:02.012
Why don't we do something
together tomorrow?

28:02.180 --> 28:03.806
Why?
'Cause you feel bad?

28:03.973 --> 28:05.599
Yeah. No.

28:05.767 --> 28:09.228
I mean, it'd be just fun to do
something together, you know?

28:09.396 --> 28:10.396
- Okay.
- Mmm.

28:10.563 --> 28:12.272
Yeah. Yeah,
like build a rocket.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.941
Sure, if you want to.

28:14.109 --> 28:15.943
That's retarded.

28:16.111 --> 28:19.279
Yeah.

28:19.447 --> 28:22.116
- What do you want to do?
- Nothing.

28:22.283 --> 28:24.785
Oh, come on now, Kyle, you must be
passionate about something.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.370
- You want to know what I like?
- Yeah.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.080
- I like looking at vaginas...
- Ahh.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.289
...all day long.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.461
- There you go.
- Yeah.

28:34.629 --> 28:38.132
But maybe do something
non-vagina related.

28:38.299 --> 28:40.968
You know, outside the vagina.

28:41.136 --> 28:44.346
Okay, uh,
we could go to the mall.

28:44.514 --> 28:46.640
Okay. And then
we'll catch a movie.

28:46.808 --> 28:48.976
Yeah, sure,
at the mall, you know?

28:49.144 --> 28:51.979
And then we'll maybe
look for a new computer.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.605
No no, we'll just hang.

28:53.773 --> 28:56.150
Dad, did I tell you that
we had to buy a new computer?

28:56.317 --> 28:58.527
No, I said... if you
were listening to me...

28:58.695 --> 29:00.654
that we could look
for a new computer, okay?

29:00.822 --> 29:02.948
And then we'll go
to your movie.

29:03.116 --> 29:06.076
Okay. But we're not buying
a new computer.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.287
Yeah, all right.
Sounds fun.

29:08.455 --> 29:09.997
This isn't
the biggest screen.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.874
Jesus christ,
how about a "thank you"?

29:12.041 --> 29:14.460
Are you on your period
or something?

29:14.627 --> 29:16.128
Can I not say anything?

29:17.964 --> 29:21.633
Hey, isn't that... isn't that
Mike with Miss Reed?

29:21.801 --> 29:23.051
Yeah, it is.

29:23.219 --> 29:24.636
Dude, I wouldn't let
my bitch treat me that way.

29:24.804 --> 29:27.306
- You don't have a "bitch. "
- How do you know?

29:27.474 --> 29:29.183
- Hi, Kyle.
- Hey.

29:29.350 --> 29:31.059
- Mr. Clayton.
- Hello, Andrew.

29:31.227 --> 29:33.771
Oh, wow, so he got it
for you. Sweet.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.565
Not that sweet.
It's not the biggest one.

29:36.733 --> 29:39.943
What... Dad, we're gonna
go home and hook this up.

29:40.111 --> 29:41.320
What about going
to the movies?

29:41.488 --> 29:43.655
Dad, we'll go
to dinner later!

29:43.823 --> 29:45.699
Okay, fine.

29:46.868 --> 29:48.869
Uh, what are you
gonna do, Mr. Clayton?

29:49.037 --> 29:51.413
Oh, probably go to the movies
by myself, Andrew.

29:51.581 --> 29:53.248
Andrew!

29:53.416 --> 29:55.667
What are you doing?

29:57.003 --> 29:59.254
You're carrying that
the rest of the way.

29:59.422 --> 30:01.048
What, are you gonna cry?

30:01.216 --> 30:02.549
Fucking pussy.

30:02.717 --> 30:04.384
God damn it.

30:19.192 --> 30:21.485
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

30:21.653 --> 30:24.071
What did you do today?

30:24.239 --> 30:27.533
I was with Mike. He was having
a breakdown about his divorce.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.952
He was depressed 'cause
he had to go to this wedding,

30:30.119 --> 30:33.539
so I went with him to the mall
and helped him pick up a suit to wear.

30:33.706 --> 30:35.541
I know, I saw you two there.

30:35.708 --> 30:38.043
You did?
Why didn't you say hi?

30:38.211 --> 30:41.463
I don't know.
It seemed weird.

30:41.631 --> 30:43.632
Does it bother you
that I have male friends?

30:43.800 --> 30:46.552
No, it bothers me you keep
our relationship secret

30:46.719 --> 30:48.387
and you're out
in public with him.

30:48.555 --> 30:51.557
Okay. What are you
doing tonight, hmm?

30:51.724 --> 30:54.309
Let's go out.
We'll go out someplace fancy,

30:54.477 --> 30:56.228
someplace the world
can see us.

30:56.396 --> 30:59.314
How about
Outback Steakhouse?

30:59.482 --> 31:01.608
Oh.

31:01.776 --> 31:03.569
Anyone who's anybody
will be there.

31:03.736 --> 31:05.487
You know, we can have
Aussie-Tizers...

31:05.655 --> 31:08.866
You know, wait, I can't.
I promised Kyle I'd take him out.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.367
Let me take
both of you out.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.369
- It'll be my treat.
- Really?

31:12.537 --> 31:16.164
Oh. That's so nice.

31:19.627 --> 31:22.462
- Hey, Kyle.
- I'm in here.

31:24.465 --> 31:26.091
Why do you always
tip over this photo?

31:26.259 --> 31:28.760
'Cause I hate it.
I look inbred.

31:28.928 --> 31:30.053
I think you look handsome.

31:30.221 --> 31:32.139
We're going out to dinner
tonight with claire.

31:32.307 --> 31:33.974
What? No.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.434
- No, we're not.
- Oh, come on.

31:35.602 --> 31:37.185
- I thought she was seeing Mr. Lane.
- No no.

31:37.353 --> 31:40.063
They're just friends and she's trying
to help him out through a tough time.

31:40.231 --> 31:41.648
Why am I explaining
this to you, Kyle?

31:41.816 --> 31:43.233
Dad, okay, look,

31:43.401 --> 31:45.777
it's bad enough being
seen with a teacher as a dad,

31:45.945 --> 31:47.988
but being seen
with two teachers is AIDS.

31:48.156 --> 31:49.573
Okay, get dressed.
Put on something nice.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.326
If you don't act right at dinner,
I'll stab you in the face.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.831
So what do you like
to do, Kyle?

31:57.999 --> 32:00.292
Nothing.

32:00.460 --> 32:03.378
Nothing? You must like
to do something.

32:03.546 --> 32:05.756
No.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.717
Kyle just got a new monitor
for his computer.

32:08.885 --> 32:11.303
So what do you like
to do on the computer?

32:11.471 --> 32:14.014
Oh, well, you know,
it's funny you ask.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.058
- I like...
- Games, mostly.

32:17.310 --> 32:20.562
- Kyle, who are you texting?
- Andrew.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.731
Why don't you give it a break
while we're eating, son?

32:22.899 --> 32:24.107
No, I can't do that.
It's important.

32:24.275 --> 32:26.109
Put it away.

32:33.409 --> 32:35.243
So, Kyle,

32:35.411 --> 32:37.496
do you have a girlfriend?

32:37.664 --> 32:41.291
I'm not gonna talk to you
about my personal affairs.

32:43.252 --> 32:44.670
- Okay.
- Ooh.

32:44.837 --> 32:45.921
Watch out.

32:46.089 --> 32:48.131
Are you guys doing it?

32:51.970 --> 32:54.137
Yeah, all the time.
Non-stop.

32:54.305 --> 32:56.181
I'm hurting right now.

32:59.102 --> 33:01.311
Let's not make me
throw up.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.441
So do you play sports?

33:06.609 --> 33:09.319
No no.
I'm a big spaz like my dad.

33:09.487 --> 33:12.406
Well, I was on the dive team
in college.

33:12.573 --> 33:14.992
Diving is not really
a sport, it's falling.

33:18.413 --> 33:19.413
I'm sorry.

33:19.580 --> 33:22.791
No offense.
It's just funny.

33:22.959 --> 33:25.252
Hey, why don't we rent
a movie after dinner?

33:25.420 --> 33:28.046
Sure, as long as
it's not horror.

33:28.214 --> 33:30.215
- Really?
- I do not like horror.

33:30.383 --> 33:32.467
Zombies? Are you
okay with zombies?

33:32.635 --> 33:34.344
- No.
- Oh.

33:34.512 --> 33:37.848
Do you like musicals?
I love musicals.

33:39.225 --> 33:41.059
Bob Fosse
was a great director.

33:41.227 --> 33:42.936
He did "Sweet charity"

33:43.104 --> 33:44.730
- and "All That Jazz. "
- "Cabaret. "

33:44.897 --> 33:47.441
One of the great
Nazi musicals of all time,

33:47.608 --> 33:49.317
besides "The Sound
of Music," you know?

33:49.485 --> 33:51.945
Then he did "Star 80."
That was not a musical, but...

33:52.113 --> 33:53.989
- I only like the musicals.
- Oh, well.

33:54.157 --> 33:56.825
- Me too.
- "Willy Wonka. "

33:56.993 --> 33:59.953
- Which one?
- Lance: Well, Gene Wilder.

34:00.121 --> 34:02.205
I like Johnny Depp.

34:02.373 --> 34:03.290
- Oh.
- Yeah.

34:03.458 --> 34:04.374
- Mm-hmm.
- But you know what?

34:04.542 --> 34:06.334
I like Gene Wilder...

34:06.502 --> 34:11.005
...in "Young...
- Both: Frankenstein. "

34:11.174 --> 34:13.842
"What hump?"

34:14.010 --> 34:15.927
Did you see it?

34:16.094 --> 34:18.054
- No.
- Oh, you should.

34:18.222 --> 34:20.474
- It's amazing.
- Really wonderful.

34:20.641 --> 34:22.016
Yeah.
Everybody's seen it.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.478
- I'm sure.
- Yeah.

34:24.645 --> 34:27.230
- Night, Miss Reed.
- Good night, Kyle.

34:27.398 --> 34:29.815
Do you think you're gonna
hit that shit tonight?

34:29.984 --> 34:31.234
- Shut up!
- Come on, dude.

34:31.402 --> 34:34.529
That shit's tight, dude.
Seriously, if you don't nail her...

34:34.697 --> 34:36.364
hey hey, if you don't nail her,
dude, you're...

34:36.532 --> 34:38.074
- you're an asshole.
- Will you stop it?

34:38.242 --> 34:40.077
Don't act like you don't think
about pussy all the time too.

34:40.244 --> 34:41.620
- I know you do.
- Kyle.

34:41.788 --> 34:43.830
You're dropping me off first,
I get it. You want me to go.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.123
I just wanna say good night
to her alone.

34:46.292 --> 34:47.918
- Okay?
- With your cock.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.668
Kyle, you ruin everything.

34:49.837 --> 34:51.588
Would you
just shut the fuck up?

34:51.755 --> 34:54.882
Jesus, man. You fucking
need to get laid. Go over there.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.676
I'll be right back.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.887
All right. Don't do anything
I wouldn't do, okay?

34:59.055 --> 35:02.599
Short of killing her,
that leaves me a lot of room.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.810
Hey, baby.

35:04.977 --> 35:06.561
See you tomorrow, Kyle.

35:06.729 --> 35:08.814
Night, whore.

35:13.569 --> 35:15.904
Hey.

35:16.072 --> 35:17.823
- That was fun.
- The kiss?

35:17.990 --> 35:19.449
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll show you something, come on.

35:19.617 --> 35:21.243
- Not tonight.
- Wow.

35:21.410 --> 35:22.869
Are you shooting
me down?

35:23.037 --> 35:25.288
Listen, I'd love to stay,
but I promised Kyle I'd be right back.

35:25.456 --> 35:27.624
Kyle doesn't like me.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.501
Oh no.
He likes you a lot.

35:29.669 --> 35:31.002
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

35:31.170 --> 35:32.254
He told me that
when I dropped him off.

35:32.421 --> 35:34.005
- He did?
- Yeah.

35:34.173 --> 35:35.757
He said I was a lucky guy.

35:35.925 --> 35:38.760
No, I'm the lucky guy.

35:40.263 --> 35:41.346
I gotta go.

35:41.514 --> 35:43.598
Oh, come on.
He's almost an adult.

35:43.766 --> 35:45.600
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

35:45.768 --> 35:48.770
Whoa.

35:48.938 --> 35:51.022
How are you gonna drive
home with that boner, huh?

35:51.190 --> 35:53.650
I don't know. There's a stick-shift
joke there somewhere

35:53.818 --> 35:56.361
but I can't find it 'cause
all the blood's leaving my brain.

35:58.614 --> 36:02.200
- Sleep well.
- Hey.

36:03.411 --> 36:06.955
Oh, that's sweet.
Mmm.

36:07.123 --> 36:10.292
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Oh. Boo.

36:10.459 --> 36:12.794
- You're mean.
- Good night, sweet pea.

36:12.962 --> 36:14.379
Good night,
cream cheese.

36:19.135 --> 36:20.927
You know I... oh!

36:21.095 --> 36:22.345
- Hmm?
- Damn you.

36:22.513 --> 36:23.597
You sure?

36:30.813 --> 36:32.355
I'm back.

36:35.109 --> 36:37.110
Kyle.

36:38.404 --> 36:39.988
Hey, Kyle.

36:40.156 --> 36:43.450
Oh, Kyle.
I told you to stop doing that.

36:57.924 --> 36:59.925
Kyle?

37:17.193 --> 37:21.029
# Don't be afraid #

37:21.197 --> 37:25.575
# It's only love #

37:25.743 --> 37:29.746
# Don't be afraid #

37:29.914 --> 37:34.501
# It's only love #

37:34.669 --> 37:38.713
# Don't be afraid #

37:38.881 --> 37:43.051
# It's only love #

37:43.219 --> 37:47.222
# Don't be afraid #

37:47.390 --> 37:51.059
# It's only love #

37:52.561 --> 38:28.430
# Love is simple #

38:57.752 --> 39:00.962
# Don't be afraid #

39:01.130 --> 39:06.176
# You're already dead #

39:06.344 --> 39:09.971
# Don't be afraid #

39:10.139 --> 39:14.768
# You're already dead #

39:14.935 --> 39:18.396
# Don't be afraid #

39:18.564 --> 39:23.360
# You're already dead #

39:23.527 --> 39:27.155
# Don't be afraid #

39:27.323 --> 39:31.826
# You're already dead #

39:32.828 --> 40:21.084
# Love is simple #

40:32.805 --> 40:59.038
# La la la la la #

41:00.040 --> 41:06.421
# La la la la la. #

41:31.614 --> 41:33.531
Welcome back, Lance.

41:33.699 --> 41:35.533
Hi.

41:35.701 --> 41:38.077
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

41:38.245 --> 41:40.747
If you need more time off,
take it.

41:40.915 --> 41:43.124
Nobody here would
fault you for that.

41:43.292 --> 41:45.376
No, I'm okay.
Thanks.

41:58.891 --> 42:01.059
Ginger.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.645
Hey, Mike.

42:03.812 --> 42:06.147
It's good to have
you back, Lancelot.

42:06.315 --> 42:07.857
Thanks.

42:24.041 --> 42:25.208
Mr. Clayton.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.293
Andrew.

42:27.461 --> 42:29.921
How are you doing?

42:30.089 --> 42:32.549
Okay.
I'm really sorry.

42:32.716 --> 42:34.592
Thanks.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.594
And I'm sorry
about my mom.

42:36.762 --> 42:39.180
- Why?
- 'Cause she threw up in your planter

42:39.348 --> 42:41.391
at that thing at your house
after the funeral.

42:41.559 --> 42:42.892
I wondered who did that.

42:43.060 --> 42:44.686
She drinks too much.

42:44.853 --> 42:46.396
I know.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.064
Don't worry, Andrew.

42:48.232 --> 42:50.149
It meant a lot to me
that you came.

42:50.317 --> 42:52.151
Thanks, Mr. Clayton.
Mr. Clayton.

42:52.319 --> 42:55.655
Something doesn't make
sense to me.

42:55.823 --> 42:57.156
What, Andrew?

42:57.324 --> 43:00.034
Did Kyle seem
that bummed out to you?

43:00.202 --> 43:01.995
What do you mean?

43:02.162 --> 43:03.705
To do what he did.
He just...

43:03.872 --> 43:07.250
it's just, he didn't
seem that sad.

43:08.836 --> 43:11.879
Andrew, Kyle was
a complex guy.

43:12.047 --> 43:15.216
Yeah, I'll say.

43:36.780 --> 43:39.782
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:42.661 --> 43:44.621
How are you?

43:44.788 --> 43:46.581
I'm okay.

43:46.749 --> 43:48.583
Good.

43:50.336 --> 43:53.588
I want to apologize that I haven't
been there more for you.

43:53.756 --> 43:57.467
It's just that
I don't do death well.

43:57.635 --> 43:59.469
Don't worry about it,
you know, I...

43:59.637 --> 44:02.597
I've been kind of a zombie
lately anyway.

44:02.765 --> 44:04.515
I'm really sorry.

44:04.683 --> 44:06.142
Please don't be mad.

44:06.310 --> 44:08.102
I'm not.

44:09.271 --> 44:11.230
Let's do something soon,
all right?

44:11.398 --> 44:13.358
All right.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.613
Cheer up, pumpkin.

44:18.781 --> 44:20.365
I like you.

44:20.532 --> 44:22.575
Thanks.

44:32.961 --> 44:35.254
Anderson:
Hardly anyone came to the funeral.

44:35.422 --> 44:36.964
I felt bad.
I should have gone.

44:37.132 --> 44:39.676
Don't blame yourself.
It was a weekday.

44:43.555 --> 44:44.806
Lance,

44:44.973 --> 44:46.808
this is Mr. Pentola.

44:46.975 --> 44:48.101
- Mr. Pentola.
- Dr. Pentola.

44:48.268 --> 44:49.644
Oh, Doctor.

44:49.812 --> 44:52.647
Nice to meet you, Mr. Clayton.
I'm very sorry for your loss.

44:52.815 --> 44:53.773
Thank you.

44:53.941 --> 44:56.067
Dr. Pentola is a therapist.

44:56.235 --> 44:58.653
We called him in
because we were afraid

44:58.821 --> 45:02.281
Kyle's death may
trigger other suicides.

45:02.449 --> 45:04.117
He's a grief counselor.

45:04.284 --> 45:05.493
Oh.

45:05.661 --> 45:06.911
Before we begin,

45:07.079 --> 45:08.663
I've read a lot of suicide notes,

45:08.831 --> 45:12.083
and this one seemed...

45:12.251 --> 45:13.960
deep.

45:14.128 --> 45:15.545
Really?

45:15.713 --> 45:17.463
I need to ask you
a question.

45:17.631 --> 45:20.049
And I want you to be
completely honest with me.

45:20.217 --> 45:22.135
Of course.

45:22.302 --> 45:24.429
Did Kyle have any friends?

45:24.596 --> 45:25.972
Excuse me?

45:26.140 --> 45:27.932
Well, it's just
no one's come to see me.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.559
You'd have to know Kyle.

45:29.727 --> 45:31.561
Well, I shouldn't say
no one.

45:31.729 --> 45:34.230
A couple of kids came in
with age-appropriate depression,

45:34.398 --> 45:35.606
eating disorders.

45:35.774 --> 45:37.400
One kid came in
with head lice.

45:37.568 --> 45:38.693
I know him.

45:38.861 --> 45:40.695
Not really my area
of expertise.

45:40.863 --> 45:43.573
But no one's come to talk
about Kyle.

45:43.741 --> 45:45.575
Hmm.

45:45.743 --> 45:49.287
- Oh.
- Who were his friends?

45:50.497 --> 45:53.374
- Andrew Troutman.
- And who else?

45:55.127 --> 45:56.878
That's it.

45:57.045 --> 46:00.715
Kyle was kind
of a loner.

46:00.883 --> 46:02.633
A lone wolf.

46:02.801 --> 46:06.179
Uh, I'll have to ask Andrew

46:06.346 --> 46:08.014
to come and see me.

46:08.182 --> 46:10.433
And, Lance,
that goes for you too.

46:10.601 --> 46:13.352
If you need to talk, if you wanna
get anything off your chest,

46:13.520 --> 46:15.104
please, just come
and see me.

46:15.272 --> 46:16.773
Of course, Doc, I will.

46:18.400 --> 46:19.692
Thank you, Lance.

46:19.860 --> 46:21.402
You're welcome,
Mr. Anderson.

46:24.823 --> 46:26.741
All right, guys,
who wants to read next?

46:26.909 --> 46:28.534
- Right here!
- All right.

46:28.702 --> 46:30.244
Who's gonna
give me $20?

46:30.412 --> 46:32.205
- All: Oh.
- Oh, come on now.

46:32.372 --> 46:35.249
Mike: All right. Okay.

46:36.877 --> 46:38.586
Jason.

46:45.928 --> 46:47.178
Go ahead.

46:50.974 --> 46:53.559
"Negro?

46:53.727 --> 46:55.686
I may be young
but I'm not your boy

46:55.854 --> 46:58.439
I won't pick your cotton
or pick up your dishes

46:58.607 --> 47:01.609
Yeah, I sing, I dance

47:01.777 --> 47:04.737
But I do it with the dignity
of my ancestors

47:04.905 --> 47:07.365
I am not your monkey. "

47:09.743 --> 47:11.077
Right on.

47:13.705 --> 47:15.873
Stay black, y'all.

47:17.960 --> 47:20.503
Anybody else
have their haiku?

48:17.185 --> 48:18.978
- Claire: Hello?
- Hey, sweet tarts.

48:19.146 --> 48:21.230
- Hey.
- How are you?

48:21.398 --> 48:24.400
- What are you doing?
- I'm watching Mike play basketball.

48:24.568 --> 48:25.860
Oh.

48:27.863 --> 48:30.031
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

48:30.198 --> 48:31.991
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

48:32.159 --> 48:33.701
- Oh my God!
- What?

48:33.869 --> 48:36.495
I gotta go. Mike just won
the basketball game.

48:38.332 --> 48:39.790
Yeah, Mike!

48:51.970 --> 48:53.596
- Hi.
- Hi.

48:53.764 --> 48:55.932
I made you something.

48:56.099 --> 48:56.974
What?

48:57.142 --> 49:00.144
- Those brownies.
- Oh.

49:00.312 --> 49:02.021
- Oh.
- Yeah.

49:02.189 --> 49:04.023
Well, I'll come over
and have some.

49:04.191 --> 49:06.275
I was thinking maybe I could come in
and we'd eat them together.

49:06.443 --> 49:07.652
No, I can't.

49:07.819 --> 49:09.445
- Why not?
- I'm busy.

49:09.613 --> 49:11.155
Bonnie, I really need
to talk to somebody.

49:11.323 --> 49:13.699
I don't like people
in my apartment.

49:13.867 --> 49:16.869
My apartment is a little
sad right now, you know?

49:18.956 --> 49:22.583
If I... if I let you in,
you can't tell anybody.

49:22.751 --> 49:24.710
- Okay.
- Okay.

49:24.878 --> 49:27.922
So...

49:28.090 --> 49:30.091
- Brownies, huh?
- Yeah.

49:30.258 --> 49:32.593
- Come in.
- Ah.

49:37.391 --> 49:41.352
Please, don't tell
anybody, okay?

49:41.520 --> 49:43.771
Because I... I don't wanna get
thrown out of here.

49:43.939 --> 49:46.148
- Oh, I promise.
- Thanks.

49:46.316 --> 49:48.651
I- I know
it's a fire hazard

49:48.819 --> 49:51.779
and I know it's not
rational, but...

49:51.947 --> 49:55.992
I feel that
if I throw anything out,

49:56.159 --> 49:58.202
something terrible
will happen.

49:58.370 --> 50:00.162
- No, I understand that.
- Good.

50:09.965 --> 50:12.174
What's wrong, sweetie?

50:15.012 --> 50:17.763
I know my son was a jerk,
but I miss him.

50:17.931 --> 50:19.974
Hey.

50:20.142 --> 50:22.059
- Of course you do.
- Mmm.

50:22.227 --> 50:23.811
It'll get better.

50:23.979 --> 50:27.398
It doesn't feel like it
right now.

50:27.566 --> 50:29.108
Do you know that

50:29.276 --> 50:32.319
I have read every one
of your books?

50:32.487 --> 50:35.364
- How?
- How?

50:35.532 --> 50:37.074
You threw 'em out.

50:37.242 --> 50:38.826
Oh, yeah.

50:38.994 --> 50:41.746
You are very talented.

50:41.913 --> 50:43.039
Really?

50:43.206 --> 50:45.541
Honest.
You have a gift.

50:45.709 --> 50:48.544
And you can't give up.

50:48.712 --> 50:50.046
I won't.

50:50.213 --> 50:51.464
Listen,

50:51.631 --> 50:54.800
they're gonna have a zombie
marathon on television

50:54.968 --> 50:57.928
and I cordially

50:58.096 --> 50:59.513
invite you, sir.

50:59.681 --> 51:01.348
Oh, well, bless you, madam.

51:01.516 --> 51:03.142
- Uh-huh.
- It's a date.

51:03.310 --> 51:04.351
Good.

51:04.519 --> 51:06.479
Don't forget the brownies.

51:06.646 --> 51:08.731
- I won't forget.
- No.

51:12.027 --> 51:14.278
Your dog's staring at me.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.906
What dog?

51:19.951 --> 51:22.369
I got ya.

51:24.706 --> 51:26.248
- Lance!
- Oh.

51:26.416 --> 51:28.459
- I'm glad I caught you.
- What's up?

51:28.627 --> 51:32.338
You know that while we respect
individual privacy,

51:32.506 --> 51:35.549
we also respect freedom of speech
and expression here at school?

51:35.717 --> 51:38.052
- Yeah.
- Well, one of the kids on the paper

51:38.220 --> 51:40.846
went online and they found
Kyle's police report...

51:41.014 --> 51:44.558
the report of his death. And now they've
gone and published his suicide note.

51:44.726 --> 51:47.353
- Oh my God.
- Yeah. I just found out about it.

51:47.521 --> 51:49.814
I thought you should know.
It's all over campus.

51:49.981 --> 51:52.233
- Really?
- Yeah.

51:52.400 --> 51:54.527
You... are you
gonna be all right?

51:54.694 --> 51:56.570
Sure.

51:56.738 --> 51:58.823
I'm really sorry
about this, Lance.

51:58.990 --> 52:01.075
It's that goddamn
first amendment, huh?

52:01.243 --> 52:02.743
Yeah.

52:08.333 --> 52:10.209
Lance's voice:
"To all those I hate,

52:10.377 --> 52:13.003
I don't know why
I'm writing this.

52:13.171 --> 52:16.715
You never cared about what I thought
or felt while I was alive.

52:16.883 --> 52:20.553
Besides you're all too shallow
to comprehend the pain I feel. "

52:20.720 --> 52:23.597
# I hope
I become a ghost #

52:23.765 --> 52:26.934
# I hope I can see
the end of time #

52:27.102 --> 52:29.979
# I hope I become
a ghost #

52:30.147 --> 52:33.149
# And make sure
the future turns out fine #

52:33.316 --> 52:36.360
# I hope
I become a ghost #

52:36.528 --> 52:39.697
# Oh, when the world
is said and done #

52:39.865 --> 52:42.992
# The stars will become
so close #

52:43.160 --> 52:46.287
# And there will be nowhere
that I can't run #

52:46.454 --> 52:50.249
# Ooh ooh ooh ooh #

53:13.273 --> 53:16.317
# I hope
I become a ghost #

53:16.484 --> 53:19.320
# And watch all my
grandchildren growing old #

53:19.487 --> 53:22.156
# Some they will
remember me #

53:22.324 --> 53:25.367
# And others through the stories
they've been told #

53:25.535 --> 53:28.704
# Now I don't intend
to frighten you #

53:28.872 --> 53:31.957
# I just wanna see
if what I think is true #

53:32.125 --> 53:34.877
# 'cause then and only then
we'll know #

53:35.045 --> 53:38.297
# If it was worth
to become a ghost #

53:38.465 --> 53:42.843
# Ooh ooh ooh ooh #

53:50.018 --> 53:55.648
# There's nothing
sad about it #

53:55.815 --> 54:01.278
# There's
nothing sad about it... #

54:05.700 --> 54:08.035
Lance's voice:
"Which brings me to you, Dad.

54:08.203 --> 54:10.120
Lance and Kyle's voices:
Don't blame yourself.

54:10.288 --> 54:13.958
You tried hard and were
the best dad a kid could want.

54:14.125 --> 54:17.336
I blame me doing this
on a defect in me...

54:17.504 --> 54:20.506
Kyle's voice:
... in my soul.

54:20.674 --> 54:22.675
I'm sorry. "

54:30.308 --> 54:33.811
# Now that I've become
a ghost #

54:35.772 --> 54:40.359
# I don't get to laugh
with friends like you #

54:40.527 --> 54:45.281
# There's nothing sad
about it #

54:45.448 --> 54:50.661
# There's nothing
sad about it. #

54:53.164 --> 54:54.415
I love you, Dad.

55:01.589 --> 55:05.342
Has anyone seen
carl or Steven?

55:05.510 --> 55:06.593
Mm-hmm.

55:06.761 --> 55:09.138
Oh, you have?
So they're in school?

55:09.306 --> 55:11.598
Yeah, I saw 'em
this morning.

55:14.227 --> 55:16.603
First of all I want to thank you all
for being here,

55:16.771 --> 55:18.439
especially the newcomers.

55:18.606 --> 55:20.899
It means a lot to me.

55:21.067 --> 55:23.402
Who has experience
with writing poetry?

55:23.570 --> 55:26.071
- Yes, Heather.
- Can I ask a question?

55:26.239 --> 55:27.406
Sure.

55:27.574 --> 55:30.409
What was Kyle's
favorite band?

55:30.577 --> 55:31.577
Uh...

55:31.745 --> 55:33.912
he liked
Bruce Hornsby.

55:34.080 --> 55:36.081
Yes, Ray?

55:36.249 --> 55:37.875
Did he listen
to any metal?

55:38.043 --> 55:40.502
- A little Ozzy.
- I knew it.

55:40.670 --> 55:43.881
Anybody have any questions
about poetry or...

55:44.049 --> 55:44.923
Yes, Jason?

55:45.091 --> 55:46.759
Did the boy know Jesus
before he went?

55:46.926 --> 55:49.553
Well, I would say
he was an agnostic.

55:49.721 --> 55:52.056
But I think he was spiritual
in his own way.

55:52.223 --> 55:53.640
Yeah... yes, Heather?

55:53.808 --> 55:54.892
What's his sign?

55:55.060 --> 55:57.686
Oh, he was born
April 18th, so...

55:57.854 --> 55:59.730
Aries.

55:59.898 --> 56:02.399
I can't believe
you didn't know that.

56:02.567 --> 56:05.444
You know, anybody know
Ezra Pound?

56:05.612 --> 56:07.946
Lawrence Ferlinghetti?

56:10.283 --> 56:13.243
You know
what Kyle really liked?

56:13.411 --> 56:14.787
Emily Dickinson.

56:14.954 --> 56:16.538
What band is that?

56:16.706 --> 56:18.624
It wasn't a band.
She was a poet.

56:18.792 --> 56:21.877
- She hot?
- Um, she was a Victorian.

56:22.045 --> 56:24.963
If you like your buttoned-down
girl, she was one of 'em.

56:25.131 --> 56:27.424
Nice.

56:27.592 --> 56:28.884
- Mr. Clayton.
- Peter.

56:29.052 --> 56:32.262
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.

56:32.430 --> 56:33.889
It's about Kyle's note.

56:34.057 --> 56:35.891
It... it affected me a lot.

56:36.059 --> 56:39.937
Well, it seemed to affect
a lot of students.

56:40.105 --> 56:42.189
- I'm not happy, Mr. Clayton.
- Mm-hmm.

56:42.357 --> 56:45.234
I'm living a lie. I'm gay.

56:45.402 --> 56:47.236
And Kyle's suicide note,

56:47.404 --> 56:50.280
it's helped me get
the courage to come out finally.

56:50.448 --> 56:52.491
Well, are you sure
you want to do that?

56:52.659 --> 56:54.660
I'm misunderstood too,
just like he was.

56:54.828 --> 56:56.745
I just want to be happy.

56:56.913 --> 56:59.706
Good for you, Peter.
I- I wish you the best.

56:59.874 --> 57:01.667
Thank you.

57:06.548 --> 57:08.674
Hey, Mr. Clayton.

57:08.842 --> 57:10.175
- Mr. Clayton.
- Ginger.

57:10.343 --> 57:12.302
Kyle was right.
Emily Dickinson's great.

57:12.470 --> 57:14.179
Isn't she?

57:14.347 --> 57:15.848
- Mr. Clayton?
- Yes.

57:16.015 --> 57:19.268
- I wrote another poem.
- Can't wait to hear it, Heather.

57:19.436 --> 57:22.354
- John. Doctor.
- Hey.

57:22.522 --> 57:24.064
Claire.

57:24.232 --> 57:27.025
Mr. C., what's up?

57:29.279 --> 57:33.282
"Milky white skin
and hair so brown

57:33.450 --> 57:36.201
I wish I had known
how bad you hurt

57:36.369 --> 57:38.871
I could have held you
while you cried

57:39.038 --> 57:41.039
You were too sweet
to stay

57:41.207 --> 57:42.833
In this harsh world

57:43.001 --> 57:46.211
But I will always
keep you close to my heart

57:46.379 --> 57:49.965
- My angel in cargo pants. "
- Boy: Oh, wow.

58:06.107 --> 58:09.026
He was such a sweet kid.

58:09.194 --> 58:11.403
And kind.

58:13.114 --> 58:15.908
Oh, please.
They're everywhere.

58:16.075 --> 58:17.910
As a father,

58:18.077 --> 58:21.079
I don't know what I'd do
if Hunter did something like this.

58:21.247 --> 58:23.207
My heart really goes
out to you, Lance.

58:23.374 --> 58:24.875
Thanks.

58:25.043 --> 58:27.419
It's so sad. I didn't know
he was such a good writer.

58:27.587 --> 58:30.422
Did he write anything else?

58:32.300 --> 58:34.885
Yeah, he did.

58:35.053 --> 58:38.305
I know it's really personal,
but do you think I could read it?

58:38.473 --> 58:41.141
Well, if you came over
to my apartment.

58:41.309 --> 58:44.061
I just don't want his stuff
out there, you know, floating around.

58:44.229 --> 58:46.396
Sure.
How about tonight?

58:46.564 --> 58:47.898
Great.

58:52.487 --> 58:54.571
My playoff game's tonight.

58:57.408 --> 58:59.243
All right.
Not the lip.

58:59.410 --> 59:00.827
You know I can't
take the lip.

59:00.995 --> 59:02.746
Oh, thanks, Mike.

59:04.499 --> 59:05.958
What time?

59:06.125 --> 59:09.461
I'm gonna need a little time because,
you know, I haven't cleaned.

59:09.629 --> 59:11.255
Yeah, I understand.

59:11.422 --> 59:15.592
- Well, 8:00?
- That's great.

59:22.475 --> 59:24.518
Good luck tonight.

59:25.645 --> 59:27.104
Thanks.

59:28.648 --> 59:30.148
If you think this is
a bad idea...

59:30.316 --> 59:32.359
No no no.
Not at all.

59:32.527 --> 59:34.861
I found something
Kyle wrote

59:35.029 --> 59:38.365
and I really think
you need to hear it.

59:38.533 --> 59:40.534
Okay.

59:54.382 --> 59:57.050
This is from his journal.

59:57.218 --> 01:00:01.179
"I went out to dinner
with my dad and claire tonight.

01:00:02.807 --> 01:00:04.433
I'm so happy for him,

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:07.227
but at the same time
seeing them together

01:00:07.395 --> 01:00:10.063
only proves that I'll
never be happy.

01:00:10.231 --> 01:00:13.900
I know I'll never find
a woman like her...

01:00:14.068 --> 01:00:17.571
so pretty, so perfect.

01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:21.283
She seems to complete him.

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:27.414
I hope they make it.

01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:29.666
I hope they last.

01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:32.919
I hope I'm leaving
my dad in good hands.

01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:37.299
No one could ever get me.

01:00:40.219 --> 01:00:42.429
I don't even get me. "

01:00:44.223 --> 01:00:45.599
Oh.

01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:48.935
I didn't know anyone
could feel that way about me.

01:00:49.103 --> 01:00:51.271
He did like me.
He really did.

01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:52.939
He did.
He really did.

01:00:53.107 --> 01:00:55.233
I thought you were lying
to make me feel better.

01:00:55.401 --> 01:00:57.861
No. I'd never do that.

01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:59.321
- Really?
- Really.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:26.390
Mr. Clayton.

01:01:26.557 --> 01:01:28.600
- Good morning, Heather.
- Yes.

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:30.310
Good morning.

01:01:30.478 --> 01:01:33.397
Do you have anything
of Kyle's?

01:01:33.564 --> 01:01:34.606
What?

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:37.192
That I could have?

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.361
- No.
- Oh.

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:42.280
Wait a second.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.911
Here you go.

01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:49.413
Bruce Hornsby?

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.999
That was his favorite.

01:01:53.167 --> 01:01:54.960
Thank you.

01:02:12.687 --> 01:02:15.522
I need to talk
about last night.

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:17.691
Yeah, I need to talk
about last night too.

01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:20.318
Yeah.

01:02:20.486 --> 01:02:23.488
I'm tired of hiding
our relationship.

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:33.039
Mmm.

01:02:53.978 --> 01:02:56.396
- Dan.
- Lance.

01:02:56.564 --> 01:02:59.483
- Ginger.
- Mr. Clayton, look at this.

01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:01.443
Oh.

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:06.990
Heather.

01:03:07.158 --> 01:03:08.909
Hey, Mr. C.

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:11.661
Oh, Peter.

01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:13.914
- Don't leave me hanging.
- Oh.

01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:16.124
I don't know
if Kyle ever told you,

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:17.793
but he and I were
kinda bros.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.795
I'm gonna win this game
tonight in his honor.

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:21.880
Great, Peter.

01:03:35.686 --> 01:03:37.562
Andrew:
Mr. Clayton?

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:38.772
Andrew.

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.191
It doesn't seem right,
does it?

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:43.026
What doesn't seem right?

01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:44.861
How everyone is acting.

01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:46.780
Like they liked Kyle.

01:03:46.948 --> 01:03:48.865
No, it doesn't.

01:03:49.033 --> 01:03:51.034
You know what else
is weird?

01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:54.538
- What?
- Kyle's suicide note.

01:03:54.705 --> 01:03:56.414
In what way?

01:03:56.582 --> 01:03:58.917
That stuff about being
an insignificant molecule

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:01.711
bouncing around in a meaningless
godless universe.

01:04:01.879 --> 01:04:05.340
Don't take this the wrong way,
but Kyle was...

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:07.384
What?

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:09.386
Kinda dumb.

01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:11.596
Ha. No.

01:04:11.764 --> 01:04:14.641
Kyle was actually smart, Andrew.

01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:17.853
You know, he just pretended
to be dumb, even around you

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:20.730
so, you know, people
wouldn't pick on him.

01:04:20.898 --> 01:04:22.816
Yeah, maybe.

01:04:22.984 --> 01:04:25.735
- Heather: It's mine!
- Ginger: Let go, you crazy...

01:04:25.903 --> 01:04:27.237
Hey!

01:04:27.405 --> 01:04:28.780
Oh! Get off!

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:30.323
You didn't even like Kyle!

01:04:30.491 --> 01:04:31.867
You didn't like Kyle!

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:34.035
Shut up, whore!

01:04:43.629 --> 01:04:46.381
Bruce Hornsby?

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:48.592
Lance:
I need to talk to someone.

01:04:48.759 --> 01:04:50.302
That's why I'm here.

01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:52.971
I feel terrible.

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:54.931
Suicide leaves
many victims.

01:04:55.099 --> 01:04:57.100
Don't beat yourself up.

01:04:57.268 --> 01:04:59.477
Kyle may have been suffering
from a chemical imbalance.

01:04:59.645 --> 01:05:02.188
And I know that the note
being published

01:05:02.356 --> 01:05:04.274
has caused you some
distress,

01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:07.861
but in many ways
it's been a very positive thing.

01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:09.946
Students are
coming to see me.

01:05:10.114 --> 01:05:11.823
It's the breakthrough
I've been waiting for.

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:14.159
Who knows how many
of these kids

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:17.495
I can help because they're
reaching out for the first time?

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:20.790
You have to remember
the part where Kyle writes:

01:05:20.958 --> 01:05:23.084
"I love you, Dad. "

01:05:24.545 --> 01:05:26.588
But what if he didn't
really feel that way?

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:28.715
But he did.

01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:32.135
Lance, suicide

01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:34.679
is a permanent solution

01:05:34.847 --> 01:05:36.973
to temporary problems.

01:05:37.141 --> 01:05:39.017
And who knows

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:42.020
how many kids we won't lose
because of that note?

01:05:43.064 --> 01:05:44.814
Keep your chin up knowing

01:05:44.982 --> 01:05:48.318
that Kyle may have not
died in vain.

01:05:50.404 --> 01:05:53.907
# In light of all
I've learned so far #

01:05:54.075 --> 01:05:56.660
# I don't believe
I'm so strange #

01:05:56.827 --> 01:05:59.788
# In spite of all
this time I spend #

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:02.374
# calling the air
by a name #

01:06:02.541 --> 01:06:05.418
# When the first light
goes over the trees #

01:06:05.586 --> 01:06:07.963
# He will be
singing with me #

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:11.132
# And if I feel like
singing alone #

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.885
# He always
leaves me be #

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:16.680
# I'm shaking
my shadow hand #

01:06:16.847 --> 01:06:19.516
# As the sun moves
round the bend #

01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:22.435
# With an imaginary man #

01:06:22.603 --> 01:06:28.316
# And we'll make-believe
around and around again #

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:31.611
# I'm shaking
my shadow hand... #

01:06:37.868 --> 01:06:39.077
Lance:
Dr. Pentola.

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:40.829
Lance, you don't look
so good.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:42.747
Well, I had kind
of a rough weekend.

01:06:42.915 --> 01:06:44.457
I did a lot of soul
searching

01:06:44.625 --> 01:06:46.960
and I thought about what you said
about Kyle's note

01:06:47.128 --> 01:06:48.712
and the effect
on the other kids,

01:06:48.879 --> 01:06:51.047
and...

01:06:51.215 --> 01:06:53.049
this is Kyle's journal.

01:06:53.217 --> 01:06:55.051
I brought it to you to read.

01:06:55.219 --> 01:06:58.138
I want you to read it, and if you think
it'll be of value to the other kids,

01:06:58.305 --> 01:07:00.724
I wanna publish it
and hand it out to them.

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:05.812
- I'll see if I can't give it a look.
- Oh, thanks.

01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:11.234
Lance:
Well?

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:16.406
It's so sad.

01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:17.782
Yeah.

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:20.035
I mean, Kyle was such

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:22.829
a strong powerful writer.

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:25.707
So tortured.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.625
Yes, he was.

01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:32.547
What are you
gonna call it?

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:35.800
I was thinking
"I Am What I Hate. "

01:07:35.968 --> 01:07:37.218
What?

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:41.598
"I Am What I Hate. "
Kyle wrote that in chapter six.

01:07:41.766 --> 01:07:43.141
Oh.

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:45.518
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:07:45.686 --> 01:07:47.520
I don't like it at all.

01:07:47.688 --> 01:07:49.064
Why?

01:07:51.108 --> 01:07:53.860
- To me, a better title...
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:57.072
...would be
"You Don't Know Me. "

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:58.448
- Oh.
- You know?

01:07:58.616 --> 01:08:01.659
Because
we didn't know him.

01:08:03.954 --> 01:08:05.955
But he didn't write
that though, I mean...

01:08:06.123 --> 01:08:08.083
Yeah, but he felt that.

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:10.418
- You're inferring that from him.
- Yes.

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:12.462
Oh.

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:15.632
"I Am What I Hate" doesn't
make sense as a title.

01:08:17.801 --> 01:08:21.429
Give me a kiss. Aw.

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:27.227
- Come here.
- Oh.

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:32.607
# Everybody wants
to be a genius #

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:37.904
# You're not the only one #

01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:40.865
# With all the things that
you might do #

01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:43.993
# Which one of them
will you get to? #

01:08:44.161 --> 01:08:46.912
# Tomorrow when
you wake up #

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:49.791
# Then you'll show them #

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:57.799
# Nobody wants
to break your heart #

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:03.054
# You do it on your own #

01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:05.765
# There's nothing wrong
with you today #

01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:09.477
# Nothing you had
that they took away #

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:12.604
# But all the time
you've waited for #

01:09:12.773 --> 01:09:14.816
# What is owed to you #

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:18.153
# You wanna fight,
they will fight you blue #

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:21.990
# You wanna lie,
who will lie with you? #

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:25.326
# You're the only one
waiting for a sign #

01:09:27.453 --> 01:09:31.082
# So you're the only one #

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:33.376
# So you're
the only one #

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:47.515
# Everyone's had
some situation #

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:51.560
# Keep it to yourself #

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:54.229
# There's no need
to answer questions #

01:09:54.398 --> 01:09:58.151
# Your lies have spoiled
two confessions #

01:09:58.319 --> 01:10:00.486
# And all the time
you've waited #

01:10:00.654 --> 01:10:03.364
# Won't come back to you #

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:07.243
# You wanna fight,
they will fight you blue #

01:10:07.411 --> 01:10:10.622
# You wanna lie,
who will lie with you? #

01:10:10.789 --> 01:10:14.083
# You're the only one
waiting for a sign... #

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:19.214
# So you're the only one #

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:21.466
# So you're
the only one #

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:25.220
# Everybody wants to be
a genius. #

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:29.349
Everybody loves the book.

01:10:29.516 --> 01:10:31.267
Yes, they do.

01:10:31.435 --> 01:10:33.978
- You did the right thing.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:10:34.146 --> 01:10:35.480
Fuck me.

01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:38.191
- I am.
- Harder.

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:42.445
No no no.
From behind.

01:10:42.613 --> 01:10:44.614
Okay. Okay.

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:49.077
- Like that?
- Yeah.

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:50.495
- Okay.
- To the left.

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:53.248
To the left.
My left. My left.

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:55.375
Okay.
Yeah!

01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:56.876
Yeah.
Don't stop.

01:10:57.044 --> 01:11:00.630
Don't stop.
Don't stop!

01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:02.257
- Stop! Stop. Stop.
- Okay. Sorry.

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:03.925
- Pull my hair.
- Like that?

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.677
- Not... not so hard.
- Oh, okay.

01:11:05.844 --> 01:11:08.263
Are you ready
for our undead marathon?

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:10.515
Lance: Well, that's the thing.
Something came up.

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:12.600
Kind of an emergency.
I can't make it.

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:15.645
- Sorry.
- Oh. No, it's okay.

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:17.939
- Can I take a rain check?
- Oh yeah, dear. Good.

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:20.066
Yeah, listen I...
I hope everything's okay.

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:21.859
Oh, yeah.
It's just a small emergency.

01:11:22.027 --> 01:11:25.822
- Okay. See you.
- Sorry. Bye.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:28.032
Mike:
Everything okay there, pal?

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.242
Yeah, great.

01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:31.703
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:33.746
You know what line
really blew me away,

01:11:33.914 --> 01:11:35.498
is when Kyle wrote:

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:38.960
"America is one of the finest
countries anyone ever stole. "

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.129
That was brilliant.

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:43.756
He reminds me
of my Hunter.

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:46.968
Lance, I have
a confession to make.

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:49.637
I lured you out here
under false pretenses.

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:51.973
I need to ask you
something.

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:55.184
Would it be all right with you
if we renamed the library

01:11:55.352 --> 01:11:57.937
the Kyle clayton
memorial library?

01:11:58.105 --> 01:12:00.523
But you were gonna put him
in a special-needs class.

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.151
Yeah.

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:05.403
Yeah, and I feel
really bad about that.

01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:07.655
- Oh.
- He wasn't slow.

01:12:07.823 --> 01:12:09.657
Obviously
he was brilliant.

01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:12.160
He was just bored.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:14.287
You know, we had him
totally wrong.

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:18.124
I just hope to God that our mistake
didn't have anything to do with...

01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:20.209
well, with what happened.

01:12:20.377 --> 01:12:21.669
I'm pretty sure it didn't.

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:23.004
Thanks, Lance.

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.089
Your saying that
means a lot.

01:12:25.257 --> 01:12:28.176
This tribute will be
an inspiration to other students

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:30.261
and it'll help keep
Kyle's memory alive.

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:33.806
Sure, sir. Wyatt.

01:12:33.974 --> 01:12:36.559
Thanks, Lance.
Thanks.

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:42.732
Oh!

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:46.361
Just like my prom night,
nothing went in the hole.

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:50.656
No, it's good. It's gonna be
a tasteful dedication.

01:12:50.824 --> 01:12:52.367
Very tasteful.

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:58.164
Hello?

01:13:02.127 --> 01:13:03.544
You're kidding me.

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:05.463
Thank you so much.

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:08.257
- Wow.
- What?

01:13:08.425 --> 01:13:11.386
Pentola... he sent
Kyle's journal to Dr. Dana.

01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:13.179
She loves it. She wants me
to be on the show.

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:14.680
She's gonna fly me to L.A.

01:13:14.848 --> 01:13:17.725
- What's Dr. Dana?
- She's like Oprah.

01:13:18.769 --> 01:13:21.145
Well, she's not
as big as Oprah.

01:13:23.107 --> 01:13:24.941
I mean, it's a good show,
you know?

01:13:25.109 --> 01:13:27.068
Women seem to really like it.

01:13:37.955 --> 01:13:40.331
- Andrew.
- Are you busy, Mr. Clayton?

01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:42.750
Oh, no no.
Just packing for my trip.

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:45.044
Yeah, that TV show.

01:13:45.212 --> 01:13:47.505
"Dr. Dana. "

01:13:49.049 --> 01:13:50.383
What's up?

01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:51.801
I feel bad.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:54.595
I wish I knew
he was that depressed.

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:56.472
You and me both.

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.808
You know what's strange
about the book?

01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:00.017
What?

01:14:00.185 --> 01:14:03.438
Kyle never talks
about vaginas, anal sex,

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:05.857
fisting, felching
or rim jobs.

01:14:06.024 --> 01:14:09.235
It is a little light on the felching
area, you're right.

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:12.905
But I think it's there,
Andrew, in its own way.

01:14:13.073 --> 01:14:16.742
I was his best friend.
The book is so smart and sad.

01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:18.870
He never talked
with me like that.

01:14:19.037 --> 01:14:22.081
I wish he did. Maybe he wouldn't
have done what he did.

01:14:22.249 --> 01:14:24.250
Don't blame yourself,
Andrew.

01:14:24.418 --> 01:14:26.544
One thing I know,
he liked you.

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:28.171
Then why didn't he
talk to me?

01:14:28.338 --> 01:14:29.755
What do you want me
to tell you, Andrew?

01:14:29.923 --> 01:14:31.340
Maybe it's like
I told you before,

01:14:31.508 --> 01:14:33.342
he was super smart.
He didn't want people to know

01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:35.136
because he was afraid
of being treated differently.

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:37.763
But it doesn't make sense.
He was already treated like a freak.

01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:40.308
If he was that smart he would have
loved to rub their noses in it.

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:42.935
Oh, Jesus christ, Andrew.
Why can't you let it go, okay?

01:14:43.103 --> 01:14:45.521
No wonder
your mother drinks.

01:14:45.689 --> 01:14:48.483
You know one of the last
things Kyle said to me?

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:51.486
He said that you're
a stupid fucking idiot.

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:53.529
Have a good time
on your TV show.

01:14:53.697 --> 01:14:55.364
Kyle's still dead.

01:14:55.532 --> 01:14:57.158
Andrew.

01:14:59.786 --> 01:15:02.121
Are you almost ready?
I think we should get going.

01:15:02.289 --> 01:15:04.165
Claire: I think you should
keep your pants on.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.000
I think you should put
your pants on.

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:07.710
I'm not going
to wear pants.

01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:10.254
Oh. I'm really nervous.

01:15:10.422 --> 01:15:11.631
Yeah, you should be.

01:15:11.798 --> 01:15:13.299
Mmm. Thanks.

01:15:13.467 --> 01:15:15.426
I'm using backward
psychology.

01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:18.179
It's not working.
I have to pee again.

01:15:23.894 --> 01:15:25.853
- Hello.
- Mr. Clayton,

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:28.731
I don't wanna be rude
but the show called again

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:31.776
- and we really should be leaving.
- Okay, thank you very much.

01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:35.488
Baby, that was the driver.
He said the show called.

01:15:35.656 --> 01:15:37.740
We gotta get going, okay?

01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:39.784
Oh, you look gorgeous.
Let's get going, come on.

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:42.328
- Does this make my ass look big?
- No no. Not at all.

01:15:42.496 --> 01:15:44.539
- You can't see your ass.
- What do you mean?

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:47.375
- I mean...
- So you're saying I don't have an ass?

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:50.419
I'm saying your ass is there,
but it's not too much.

01:15:50.587 --> 01:15:52.630
- I'm changing again.
- No.

01:15:54.591 --> 01:15:56.175
You know, sweetheart,

01:15:56.343 --> 01:15:58.678
I really should get over there
so I could sit down with the producer

01:15:58.845 --> 01:16:00.179
and go over with what
I'm gonna say.

01:16:00.347 --> 01:16:01.722
That would
really help me a lot.

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:02.974
- All right.
- Okay.

01:16:03.141 --> 01:16:04.934
- What do you think?
- Fabulous.

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:06.686
- I really...
- Nope.

01:16:06.853 --> 01:16:08.229
I like that dress.

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:12.525
Sometimes people on the way,
they throw up in my car.

01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:14.193
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:16:14.361 --> 01:16:16.362
Okay, let's go.

01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:19.740
- You look pretty.
- Thank you. You're so sweet.

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:22.827
Thanks. Which one of you
is on the show?

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:24.495
- I am.
- Oh.

01:16:24.663 --> 01:16:26.664
- No, you're gonna do great.
- Thanks.

01:16:26.832 --> 01:16:29.500
Hi, Lance clayton
for the "Dr. Dana" show.

01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:31.377
- Hi, guys.
- Dr. P.

01:16:31.545 --> 01:16:34.046
Lance, hi. Jerry Klein...
we spoke on the phone.

01:16:34.214 --> 01:16:35.881
- Mm-hmm.
- We can let them in.

01:16:36.049 --> 01:16:38.551
Follow me. We can go right in.
We're running a little late.

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:40.511
- You guys hit some traffic, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

01:16:40.679 --> 01:16:42.054
- Ah, wonderful.
- This is claire, my girlfriend.

01:16:42.222 --> 01:16:43.764
- Hi, claudia. Jerry Klein.
- Claire.

01:16:43.932 --> 01:16:46.350
We're not gonna have time
to go through the notes

01:16:46.518 --> 01:16:47.893
in the greenroom
as we planned,

01:16:48.061 --> 01:16:49.395
- so we're gonna do it in makeup.
- Makeup?

01:16:49.563 --> 01:16:51.397
- And that's this way. Claudia?
- Claire.

01:16:51.565 --> 01:16:53.774
Thank you so much for sending
the photos of Kyle. They're beautiful.

01:16:53.942 --> 01:16:55.568
- And also the book.
- I sent the book.

01:16:55.736 --> 01:16:57.361
Is she gonna be holding up
the back of the book?

01:16:57.529 --> 01:16:59.530
That's a director question.
I'm a segment producer.

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:01.616
How do we know
when the camera is on me?

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:04.118
You're gonna be
in the friends-and-family section.

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:05.911
Could you grab a seat?

01:17:06.079 --> 01:17:07.622
Okay, yeah. Sure.

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:10.499
I just have a couple of issues
to discuss with Lance.

01:17:10.667 --> 01:17:12.627
- Lance, do you have questions?
- No no.

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:14.211
- Look over here, please.
- Good. Good.

01:17:14.379 --> 01:17:16.881
So, Lance, if you should start
to talk about your son...

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:19.175
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
... and begin to cry, or well up...

01:17:19.343 --> 01:17:20.384
- Okay.
... just go with it.

01:17:20.552 --> 01:17:22.053
Don't be ashamed, okay?

01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:23.429
- Yeah.
- And if you cry...

01:17:23.597 --> 01:17:24.972
- Mm-hmm.
... look up.

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.474
- No, look down, please.
- Oh.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:28.142
- Don't look down. Look up.
- Can you look down?

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:29.894
- Don't tuck your chin.
- Oh.

01:17:30.062 --> 01:17:32.355
And above all,
don't be nervous.

01:17:32.522 --> 01:17:34.190
Lance, hi.

01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:36.484
- Look this way, please.
- I don't mean to bug you right now.

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:38.569
My name is Bert Green.
I'm with with McKenna Artist.

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:41.155
- Hi, Bert.
- Your son's memoir is so strong.

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:43.866
My God, it's so moving.
My heart goes out to you.

01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:45.409
Mm-hmm.

01:17:45.577 --> 01:17:47.495
- Oh, thank you.
- Have you been talking to publishers?

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:49.330
- No.
- Because I honestly think this could be

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:50.790
the biggest posthumous
autobiography

01:17:50.957 --> 01:17:52.333
since "The Diary
of Anne Frank," honestly.

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:53.417
- Really?
- Oh my God.

01:17:53.585 --> 01:17:56.087
You know
what she's done for...

01:17:56.254 --> 01:17:57.963
Yes.
Yeah, that's huge.

01:17:58.131 --> 01:18:00.091
Look, I'm gonna get out
of your hair right now.

01:18:00.258 --> 01:18:01.550
But if any of this
interests you,

01:18:01.718 --> 01:18:03.010
- give me a call, okay?
- Okay.

01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:04.762
Just give me a ring.
It's great to meet you.

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:07.807
Great to meet you.
Go out there and kill 'em.

01:18:07.974 --> 01:18:10.309
- Do it.
- Okay.

01:18:10.477 --> 01:18:14.271
- Now I'm nervous.
- Oh, great.

01:18:14.439 --> 01:18:15.898
- It's go time, all right?
- Okay.

01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:18.526
So again, Lance,
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:20.986
And let's have a great show.

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:31.956
My guest today
is Mr. Lance clayton.

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:36.252
Lance's 15-year-old son
Kyle tragically took his own life.

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:38.796
But from this terrible
story of loss

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:40.881
arose one of hope.

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:45.261
Here he is to share this powerful
story, Mr. Lance clayton.

01:18:48.223 --> 01:18:50.015
- Thanks so much forjoining us.
- Thank you, Doctor.

01:18:50.183 --> 01:18:52.601
We know it takes great
courage for you to do this.

01:18:52.769 --> 01:18:55.062
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:57.314
Now, Lance...

01:18:57.482 --> 01:18:59.650
is it all right
if I call you Lance?

01:18:59.818 --> 01:19:00.735
Yes, that's my name.

01:19:03.655 --> 01:19:07.450
One of the most difficult things
is for a parent to lose a child.

01:19:07.617 --> 01:19:10.369
Yes. Yes it is.

01:19:10.537 --> 01:19:12.955
Tell us about
your son Kyle.

01:19:21.047 --> 01:19:22.631
It's difficult, isn't it?

01:19:22.799 --> 01:19:25.509
Yeah.

01:19:25.677 --> 01:19:28.429
He was a sweet boy.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:34.185
Kind.

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.565
I'm sorry.
He was a sweet boy.

01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:48.199
I'm sorry.

01:19:48.366 --> 01:19:50.117
But there was
a lot brewing underneath?

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:54.121
The tragedy is I didn't
know until his death

01:19:54.289 --> 01:19:56.874
how sad he was
or profound.

01:19:58.001 --> 01:20:00.795
Mmm.

01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:02.755
Here's a tissue
for you.

01:20:02.923 --> 01:20:06.133
Profound.
Indeed profound.

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:07.468
Indeed.

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:10.095
"You don't know me. "

01:20:10.263 --> 01:20:12.139
This is so beautifully
written.

01:20:12.307 --> 01:20:14.975
I just...
you know, the thing is,

01:20:15.143 --> 01:20:18.312
I didn't know... I'm so proud of him.
He was a great writer.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.398
Yes, this is really
remarkable work.

01:20:21.566 --> 01:20:23.776
No matter what page
I turn to,

01:20:23.944 --> 01:20:27.780
there's something here
that really moves me.

01:20:27.948 --> 01:20:29.824
- I want to read this.
- Okay.

01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:33.702
"Is it more important
for me to be a good person

01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:36.831
or to be thought
of as a good person?

01:20:36.998 --> 01:20:39.708
I'm so sick
of living a life in fear

01:20:39.876 --> 01:20:42.545
of being found out
for the phony I am,

01:20:42.712 --> 01:20:45.548
a life where I don't trust
anyone's intentions,

01:20:45.715 --> 01:20:49.009
including my own. "

01:20:49.177 --> 01:20:50.511
Wow, that is really deep.

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:54.557
Hard to imagine that it was
written by a 15-year-old.

01:20:54.724 --> 01:20:57.643
- He was an old soul.
- Mmm.

01:20:57.811 --> 01:21:01.188
You know, I'm not gonna pretend
that I know what's going on

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:03.023
in the mind of a teenager.

01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:05.442
All I'm saying is,
Kyle made a mistake.

01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:07.486
If you're that depressed,

01:21:07.654 --> 01:21:10.364
reach out to someone.

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:13.659
And remember, suicide
is a permanent solution

01:21:13.827 --> 01:21:15.286
to temporary problems.

01:21:15.453 --> 01:21:19.582
- You want my job?
- No. Please, Dana, no. Thank you.

01:21:19.749 --> 01:21:23.043
Again, the book,
"You Don't Know Me. "

01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:25.337
And my guest has been
Lance clayton.

01:21:25.505 --> 01:21:28.299
Thank you.

01:21:28.466 --> 01:21:30.676
You were so good!

01:21:30.844 --> 01:21:33.220
Thanks, doll.

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:35.890
And I'm so glad
you used my title.

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:37.433
It's a great title.

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.728
Hello?

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:42.521
Lance, hi.
It's Bert Green.

01:21:42.689 --> 01:21:45.190
- Hi.
- You were so great on "Dr. Dana. "

01:21:45.358 --> 01:21:47.109
Oh, thanks, Bert.

01:21:47.277 --> 01:21:50.112
It was like...
it was like watching a ballet.

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:52.531
Hey, do you have time
to meet tomorrow?

01:21:52.699 --> 01:21:54.450
Because there's
a number of publishers

01:21:54.618 --> 01:21:56.952
who are dying

01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:00.331
- to meet with you.
- Well, really, no.

01:22:00.498 --> 01:22:02.416
Actually we have
to head back tomorrow.

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:05.628
They're dedicating
the school library in Kyle's honor.

01:22:05.795 --> 01:22:08.005
Good for him.
I mean, good for you.

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:09.715
That's good.

01:22:09.883 --> 01:22:12.301
Hey, let's do it soon.

01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:14.511
Because this book is hot.

01:22:14.679 --> 01:22:18.182
It's like a volcano
on the sun.

01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:20.392
Wow. That's a lot of heat.

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:21.852
I'm gonna get a hold
of you soon.

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:24.271
Okay? Bye.

01:22:55.387 --> 01:22:56.428
Lance, Lance.

01:22:56.596 --> 01:22:58.222
Oh, God.
I'm glad I caught you.

01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:59.974
Oh, your book
is on fire.

01:23:00.141 --> 01:23:01.433
- Oh.
- It is.

01:23:01.601 --> 01:23:03.602
This is...
this is Bill Tobin.

01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:05.104
- Hi.
- From Simon & Simon.

01:23:05.271 --> 01:23:07.272
- Carl Klienman from Howard Publishing.
- Hi.

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:10.484
And this is George Kenny,
from Kaufmann Press.

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:12.486
They love your book
and they wanna meet with you.

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:14.405
- It's true.
- Really.

01:23:14.572 --> 01:23:16.281
We're not gonna bother
with that right now.

01:23:16.449 --> 01:23:19.326
They're gonna have a chance to talk
with you after the dedication, okay?

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:20.619
- Good.
- Okay?

01:23:20.787 --> 01:23:25.457
And they also want
a book of yours too.

01:23:26.459 --> 01:23:28.794
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

01:23:28.962 --> 01:23:31.171
- Okay.
- See you in there.

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:38.804
I'm so proud of you,
lamb chop.

01:23:38.972 --> 01:23:40.556
Thanks.

01:23:46.771 --> 01:23:48.772
Mr. Clayton.

01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.232
Bruce Hornsby.

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.317
We wrote Mr. Hornsby
and he came.

01:23:52.485 --> 01:23:54.319
Hey, man, when I heard
what a fan Kyle was

01:23:54.487 --> 01:23:56.363
I thought,
how can I say no?

01:23:56.531 --> 01:23:57.573
All: Aw.

01:23:57.741 --> 01:24:00.534
- Thanks.
- Girl: God, he's so sweet.

01:24:09.919 --> 01:24:11.712
Girl:
Bruce Hornsby.

01:24:16.801 --> 01:24:19.595
I'd like to dedicate
this song to my biggest fan,

01:24:19.763 --> 01:24:23.682
Kyle clayton.

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:41.408
# Another song
came and went #

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:44.536
# Like the times
that we spent #

01:24:44.704 --> 01:24:47.581
# Hiding out
from the rain #

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:51.210
# Under the carnival tent #

01:24:52.337 --> 01:24:54.713
# I laughed
and she'd smile #

01:24:54.881 --> 01:24:57.591
# It would last
for awhile #

01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:59.927
# You don't know
what you got #

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:03.972
# Till you lose it
all again #

01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:06.809
# Listen to
the mandolin rain #

01:25:06.976 --> 01:25:09.895
# Listen to the music
on the lake #

01:25:10.063 --> 01:25:13.273
# Listen to
my heart break #

01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:16.527
# Every time
she runs away #

01:25:16.694 --> 01:25:19.780
# Listen to
the banjo wind #

01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:23.450
# A sad song
drifting low #

01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:25.786
# Listen to
the tears roll #

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:30.040
# Down my face
as she turns to go #

01:25:30.208 --> 01:25:33.127
# Listen to the tears
as they roll #

01:25:33.294 --> 01:25:36.797
# Down my face
as she turns to go. #

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:49.852
Mr. Clayton,

01:25:50.019 --> 01:25:52.938
I want you to know that

01:25:53.106 --> 01:25:56.233
I've always felt
not enough.

01:25:56.401 --> 01:26:01.155
My dad
rides me all the time.

01:26:01.322 --> 01:26:03.031
He calls me a loser.

01:26:04.909 --> 01:26:07.411
I almost killed myself

01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:09.955
until Kyle's note
and book came out.

01:26:11.541 --> 01:26:13.876
It saved my life.

01:26:15.795 --> 01:26:18.922
I know he's looking
down on you so proud.

01:26:22.635 --> 01:26:24.511
Thanks, Pete.

01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:35.856
Thank you,
Bruce Hornsby.

01:26:37.233 --> 01:26:40.027
Welcome students,
faculty

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:42.362
and guests.

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:44.364
Today

01:26:44.532 --> 01:26:47.367
we celebrate Kyle.

01:26:49.245 --> 01:26:51.580
Kyle has shown us
so many things;

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:53.790
how fleeting the time

01:26:53.958 --> 01:26:56.293
we spend on this earth
really is.

01:26:56.461 --> 01:26:59.755
Kyle did not die in vain.

01:26:59.923 --> 01:27:04.593
Through his book and through
our hearts he will live on.

01:27:06.304 --> 01:27:09.181
Today we dedicate
this library

01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:11.725
in his spirit...

01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:14.561
a tribute to his deep
intelligence

01:27:14.729 --> 01:27:18.732
and to the profound impact
he made on all of us

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:23.445
in the brief time we were
fortunate enough to know him.

01:27:24.739 --> 01:27:27.074
And now to accept
this honor on his behalf,

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:29.326
I give you his father,

01:27:29.494 --> 01:27:31.411
Mr. Lance clayton.

01:28:25.174 --> 01:28:27.467
You guys
didn't like Kyle.

01:28:27.635 --> 01:28:30.679
But that's okay,
I didn't either.

01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:34.850
I loved him.

01:28:35.018 --> 01:28:37.519
He was my son,

01:28:38.938 --> 01:28:40.981
but he was also
a douche bag.

01:28:45.445 --> 01:28:48.864
He wasn't very smart

01:28:49.032 --> 01:28:51.325
and he didn't kill
himself.

01:28:55.079 --> 01:28:58.165
Kyle died accidentally
while masturbating.

01:29:03.296 --> 01:29:05.380
I made it look like
a suicide

01:29:05.548 --> 01:29:08.633
and I wrote
a suicide note.

01:29:13.389 --> 01:29:16.808
I also wrote his journal.
Thank you.

01:29:32.158 --> 01:29:33.784
Thanks.

01:29:33.951 --> 01:29:37.287
You are an asshole.

01:29:37.455 --> 01:29:38.997
Yeah.

01:29:39.165 --> 01:29:41.208
Lance's voice: I used to think
the worst thing in life

01:29:41.376 --> 01:29:43.502
was to end up all alone.

01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:45.879
It's not.

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:48.340
The worst thing in life
is ending up with people

01:29:48.508 --> 01:29:50.801
who make you feel
all alone.

01:29:50.968 --> 01:29:54.763
# Pressure pushing down
on me #

01:29:54.931 --> 01:29:58.558
# Pressing down on you,
no man asked for #

01:29:58.726 --> 01:30:00.727
# Under pressure #

01:30:00.895 --> 01:30:03.146
# That burns
a building down #

01:30:03.314 --> 01:30:05.399
# Splits a family in two #

01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:08.068
# Puts people on streets #

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:12.197
# Um ba ba be #

01:30:12.365 --> 01:30:15.826
# De day da,
ee day da #

01:30:15.993 --> 01:30:18.161
# It's the terror
of knowing #

01:30:18.329 --> 01:30:20.747
# What this world
is about #

01:30:20.915 --> 01:30:24.668
# Watching some good friends
screaming, "Let me out" #

01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:29.089
# Pray tomorrow
gets me higher #

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:33.135
# Pressure on people,
people on streets #

01:30:33.302 --> 01:30:36.721
# Day day de mm hm #

01:30:36.889 --> 01:30:40.434
# Da da da ba ba

01:30:43.062 --> 01:30:44.938
# chippin' around #

01:30:45.106 --> 01:30:47.357
# Kick my brains
around the floor #

01:30:47.525 --> 01:30:50.902
# These are the days
it never rains but it pours #

01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:55.115
# Ee do ba be
ee da ba ba ba #

01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:58.785
# Um bo bo be lap #

01:30:58.953 --> 01:31:02.414
# People on streets,

01:31:02.582 --> 01:31:07.085
# People on streets,
ee da de da de da de da #

01:31:07.253 --> 01:31:10.797
# It's the terror of knowing
what this world is about #

01:31:10.965 --> 01:31:15.594
# Watching some good friends
screaming, "Let me out" #

01:31:15.761 --> 01:31:19.973
# Pray tomorrow
gets me higher high high #

01:31:20.141 --> 01:31:24.227
# Pressure on people,
people on streets #

01:31:26.355 --> 01:31:31.151
# Turned away from it all
like a blind man #

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:34.696
# Sat on a fence
but it don't work #

01:31:34.864 --> 01:31:36.990
# Keep coming up
with love #

01:31:37.158 --> 01:31:39.201
# But it's so slashed
and torn #

01:31:39.368 --> 01:31:43.997
# Why?
Why? Why? #

01:31:50.463 --> 01:31:54.508
# Love love love
love love #

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:58.053
# Insanity laughs
under pressure we're breaking #

01:31:58.221 --> 01:32:01.848
# can't we give ourselves
one more chance? #

01:32:02.016 --> 01:32:05.852
# Why can't we give love
that one more chance? #

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:10.941
# Why can't we give love
give love give love give love #

01:32:11.108 --> 01:32:14.653
# Give love give love give love
give love give love #

01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:19.908
# 'cause love's
such an old-fashioned word #

01:32:20.076 --> 01:32:23.995
# And love dares you to care #

01:32:24.163 --> 01:32:30.377
# For the people on the edge
of the night #

01:32:30.545 --> 01:32:35.382
# And love dares
you to change our way #

01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:40.095
# Of caring about ourselves #

01:32:40.263 --> 01:32:48.395
# This is our last dance #

01:32:48.563 --> 01:32:52.482
# This is ourselves #

01:32:52.650 --> 01:32:59.030
# Under pressure #

01:33:01.492 --> 01:33:03.618
# Pressure. #

01:33:19.802 --> 01:33:22.846
I knew you
wrote the book.

01:33:27.476 --> 01:33:28.768
I liked it.

01:33:28.936 --> 01:33:31.688
- Really?
- You're a good writer.

01:33:31.856 --> 01:33:34.107
I think
you should keep writing.

01:33:35.401 --> 01:33:37.110
Thanks, Andrew. I will.

01:33:38.738 --> 01:33:40.322
Hey, Andrew.

01:33:40.489 --> 01:33:42.699
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

01:33:42.867 --> 01:33:45.243
Do you want something
to eat?

01:33:45.411 --> 01:33:47.537
I'd like that
very much, sir.

01:33:47.705 --> 01:33:49.205
I'm vegetarian.

01:33:49.373 --> 01:33:51.416
I know.

01:33:55.421 --> 01:34:09.059
# Yeah #

01:34:09.226 --> 01:34:13.855
# I've always been
this way #

01:34:14.023 --> 01:34:17.567
# Never known
any other way to feel #

01:34:17.735 --> 01:34:22.113
# Got the right of way #

01:34:22.281 --> 01:34:26.117
# And all of the others
must yield #

01:34:26.285 --> 01:34:30.622
# Now I'm naked #

01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:34.250
# And I'm in school #

01:34:34.418 --> 01:34:38.630
# I can't make it #

01:34:38.798 --> 01:34:40.256
# To the door #

01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:44.761
# Yeah #

01:34:44.929 --> 01:34:48.932
# Try to understand #

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:52.936
# That an oyster can only
make a pearl #

01:34:53.104 --> 01:34:57.315
# From a grain of sand #

01:34:57.483 --> 01:35:01.277
# But from what I don't know
makes a girl #

01:35:01.445 --> 01:35:05.615
# But I'm trying #

01:35:05.783 --> 01:35:07.826
# Not to laugh #

01:35:09.954 --> 01:35:14.082
# Inside I'm dying #

01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:16.209
- # When we break #
- # When we will break #

01:35:16.377 --> 01:35:18.294
- # Apart #
- # Apart #

01:35:18.462 --> 01:35:20.380
- # Then you take #
- # Then you take #

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:22.549
- # Back your heart #
- # Back your heart #

01:35:22.717 --> 01:35:26.511
# And it aches in the dark #

01:35:26.679 --> 01:35:30.515
# But it makes #

01:35:30.683 --> 01:35:33.893
# A tiny spark #

01:35:40.568 --> 01:35:45.363
# I've always been this way #

01:35:45.531 --> 01:35:49.159
# Never known
any other way to feel #

01:35:49.326 --> 01:35:53.288
# Got the right of way #

01:35:53.456 --> 01:35:57.584
# And all of the others
must yield #

01:35:57.752 --> 01:36:01.838
# Now I'm naked #

01:36:02.006 --> 01:36:05.800
# And I'm in school #

01:36:05.968 --> 01:36:10.096
# I can't make it #

01:36:10.264 --> 01:36:12.223
# To the door #

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:18.563
# We were lying #

01:36:18.731 --> 01:36:20.190
# In the grass #

01:36:22.902 --> 01:36:27.697
# I was trying #

01:36:27.865 --> 01:36:31.159
# Oh, not to laugh #

01:36:31.327 --> 01:36:35.538
# I was drowning #

01:36:35.706 --> 01:36:40.585
# In the past. #

01:36:47.051 --> 01:36:49.344
# I know the way #

01:36:49.512 --> 01:36:52.055
# To lose my cares #

01:36:52.223 --> 01:36:54.641
# When this boy's burdens #

01:36:54.809 --> 01:36:57.352
# Are too much to bear #

01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.896
# I'm up in a cloud #

01:37:00.064 --> 01:37:02.565
# Flying in the sky #

01:37:02.733 --> 01:37:05.276
# I float away #

01:37:05.444 --> 01:37:08.071
# When I get high
high high #

01:37:08.239 --> 01:37:10.240
# Folks toss and turn #

01:37:10.407 --> 01:37:12.826
# And walk the floor #

01:37:12.993 --> 01:37:15.620
# When that old wolf
aooh aooh aooh! #

01:37:15.788 --> 01:37:18.081
# Is outside the door #

01:37:18.249 --> 01:37:20.917
# I'll roll the reefer #

01:37:21.085 --> 01:37:23.586
# If wolfy brings the rye #

01:37:23.754 --> 01:37:26.381
# Let's drink and puff,
yeah yeah #

01:37:26.549 --> 01:37:29.092
# When I get high... #

01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:32.136
come on, Mr. Wolf,
let's blow this house down.

01:37:32.304 --> 01:37:34.764
Oh, is that the best you can do?

01:37:34.932 --> 01:37:38.059
Aha. Back off, son,
let me try.

01:37:41.939 --> 01:37:44.774
Ahh. Yeah!

01:37:44.942 --> 01:37:46.818
I don't even care
about pigs.

01:37:46.986 --> 01:37:49.779
I don't care
about anything.

01:37:49.947 --> 01:37:52.323
# When things are tough #

01:37:52.491 --> 01:37:55.076
# And I've had enough #

01:37:55.244 --> 01:37:57.829
# When life gets rough #

01:37:57.997 --> 01:38:00.415
# I just light up #

01:38:00.583 --> 01:38:03.042
# Blues can't catch me #

01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:05.712
# They don't even try #

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.256
# I just look down
laughing #

01:38:08.424 --> 01:38:11.092
# When I get high
high high #

01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:12.468
# I get high! #

01:38:12.636 --> 01:38:15.680
Oh-ho-ho, I must be wearing
my elevator shoes.
