01:45.902 --> 01:50.423
~ Season 3 - Episode 5 ~
"Problems in the Reformation"

03:22.211 --> 03:24.304
My own darling.

03:26.082 --> 03:31.418
One day I shall lie with you again,
I promise.

03:32.388 --> 03:35.824
And we shall sleep together
for eternity.

04:24.907 --> 04:27.273
- Get out of the way, fellow.
- Sorry, sir.

04:27.677 --> 04:29.167
Was you trying to pass?

04:29.378 --> 04:32.279
Of course I'm trying to pass.
Quickly now.

04:32.482 --> 04:37.044
If I knows anything, sir,
you're Mr. Robert Packington, sir.

04:37.253 --> 04:40.586
Member of Parliament
and friend of the Lord Privy Seal.

04:40.790 --> 04:42.087
Ain't that right, sir?

04:42.892 --> 04:46.055
Yes, on all counts.

04:46.262 --> 04:47.923
But I thank you again to step aside.

04:48.131 --> 04:51.157
- Ain't you in a hurry, sir?
- Yes, I am.

04:51.701 --> 04:52.690
No need.

04:53.469 --> 04:55.733
This will end the hurrying.

05:06.916 --> 05:09.407
- Have we caught the villain?
- No, my lord.

05:09.619 --> 05:11.246
He ran off into Cheapside.

05:11.454 --> 05:14.787
The sergeant at arms has his men
all over the area.

05:15.091 --> 05:17.184
Pray God they catch him.

05:18.895 --> 05:22.558
For I'm sure Mr. Packington
was in every way an innocent victim.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.295
Then why was he killed?

05:26.569 --> 05:31.063
I presume to send a message to me.
I am not short of enemies, Mr. Risley.

05:31.274 --> 05:33.367
There is nothing more difficult
to carry out...

05:33.576 --> 05:36.602
...than to initiate
a new order of things.

05:37.146 --> 05:40.707
Then you think Bishop Gardiner
might be behind this?

05:41.584 --> 05:43.677
Or my Lord Suffolk?

05:47.723 --> 05:49.884
I don't speculate.

05:51.928 --> 05:55.227
What I will say
is that there are dark forces at work...

05:55.431 --> 05:59.197
...both inside and outside the court.
They must be defeated.

06:00.169 --> 06:01.602
We must be careful not to act...

06:01.804 --> 06:04.898
...until we are completely sure
of who they are and what they want.

06:06.275 --> 06:10.177
In the meantime, we must set to work
to find a new bride for the king.

06:10.379 --> 06:14.611
It's true he has an heir at last,
but one is scarcely sufficient.

06:14.817 --> 06:17.718
To be safe,
he must produce another.

06:19.055 --> 06:20.283
How is the king?

06:24.160 --> 06:26.025
He shut himself away.

06:26.229 --> 06:29.221
Some say for grief,
that he's all broken.

06:29.565 --> 06:32.056
He'll have none attend him...

06:32.702 --> 06:34.397
...but only one.

06:35.037 --> 06:36.800
Who's that?

06:58.327 --> 06:59.316
Hey.

07:00.162 --> 07:02.130
Majesty.

07:08.871 --> 07:10.133
Well...

07:11.340 --> 07:13.103
...what do you think?

07:14.810 --> 07:19.008
I don't think. Are you mad?
Thinking is dangerous.

07:23.185 --> 07:25.278
But I'll wink.

07:29.859 --> 07:30.985
Idiot.

07:31.727 --> 07:35.390
What? What about you?

07:36.332 --> 07:39.631
Think about it.
You find the perfect wife...

07:39.835 --> 07:42.929
...she's sweet, pliable...

07:43.472 --> 07:45.667
...she even has good tits.

07:45.875 --> 07:48.537
On top of that, she gives you the son
you've always wanted.

07:48.744 --> 07:49.938
And you let her die.

07:51.480 --> 07:55.382
Jesus Christ have mercy,
and you think I'm the idiot?

07:55.851 --> 07:57.944
And she's not the only one.

07:58.220 --> 08:00.620
Poor abandoned Catherine.

08:00.823 --> 08:02.518
- Careful.
- And that other one...

08:02.725 --> 08:05.922
...whose name escapes me...

08:06.128 --> 08:10.690
...as her head escaped her.
All lost. All lost.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.368
Go to hell.

08:13.569 --> 08:14.797
What, go there?

08:15.004 --> 08:17.734
I thought I'd already arrived.

08:18.741 --> 08:23.144
For surely, gracious lord,
this is hell.

08:30.052 --> 08:33.715
Poor lamb,
never to know his own mother.

08:35.024 --> 08:39.323
No, he will know her. Through me.

08:40.929 --> 08:43.763
Through others who knew
her gentle kindness.

08:45.267 --> 08:49.226
We shall all keep her memory so green
that he will think it always spring...

08:49.739 --> 08:53.436
...and she still so young and fair,
when he first hears talk of her.

08:57.346 --> 09:00.873
My lady's household
is now to be dissolved.

09:01.784 --> 09:04.150
The king himself seems very grieved
by her death.

09:04.353 --> 09:07.117
But he has commanded
that no effort be spared...

09:07.323 --> 09:10.690
...to protect this precious jewel,
his only son.

09:11.293 --> 09:14.194
A new household is to be established
for him at Hampton Court...

09:14.397 --> 09:15.523
...and I am to head it...

09:15.731 --> 09:18.700
...responsible altogether
for his nurture and education.

09:20.503 --> 09:24.439
I can think of no one who
could be trusted more, Lady Bryan.

09:26.375 --> 09:28.605
Perhaps someday soon,
God willing, Lady Mary...

09:28.811 --> 09:31.006
...you yourself will have a child.

09:31.213 --> 09:33.408
I hear some rumor
of a Spanish prince.

09:34.417 --> 09:37.386
Yes, but there is nothing definite.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.481
And in the meantime
I shall return to Hunsdon...

09:40.689 --> 09:44.352
...and live quietly in the countryside
like an English gentlewoman.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.926
Except that I shall take
the Lady Elizabeth with me.

09:48.130 --> 09:51.327
And knowing that young lady,
you shall have no quiet at all.

09:51.534 --> 09:53.331
I don't mind.

09:54.603 --> 09:59.131
She and my brother Edward are,
excepting the king...

09:59.642 --> 10:03.078
...my only family,
and I shall love them all.

10:08.184 --> 10:10.482
Oh, I had forgotten.

10:10.686 --> 10:13.621
How is your son, Sir Francis?

10:13.823 --> 10:15.620
Has he not gone away for the king?

10:16.125 --> 10:21.620
He has, my lady.
But alas, I have no news of him.

10:50.626 --> 10:53.220
Sir Francis, I came especially
to welcome you to Caserta.

10:53.929 --> 10:55.453
Leave.

11:06.542 --> 11:09.010
May I see your letters of passage?

11:32.134 --> 11:35.592
These are letters of introduction
to the prince of Naples.

11:40.442 --> 11:41.739
You don't trust me?

11:42.378 --> 11:43.845
I need to see those letters.

11:48.884 --> 11:51.318
And I need to see Cardinal Pole.

11:51.520 --> 11:55.388
Do you really suppose
you can threaten me, Sir Francis?

12:04.433 --> 12:05.798
You're sheltering a traitor.

12:06.001 --> 12:09.698
I want to know where he is.
You are going to tell me.

12:09.905 --> 12:14.899
Or God help me, I'll kill you,
and I have the immunity to do it.

12:15.110 --> 12:17.977
So is he here?

12:18.180 --> 12:21.980
Is he here?

12:22.184 --> 12:23.310
Where is he?

12:38.467 --> 12:40.128
It's called Nonsuch Palace.

12:41.303 --> 12:42.565
Why?

12:42.771 --> 12:45.137
Because it doesn't exist?

12:47.209 --> 12:48.733
No.

12:49.278 --> 12:51.974
Because there's no place like it.

12:52.748 --> 12:56.514
- But it doesn't exist.
- I'll build it.

12:56.719 --> 12:59.210
Then you will have built
an imaginary palace...

12:59.421 --> 13:03.084
...and you will need imaginary people
to fill it.

13:06.395 --> 13:08.795
Are there not lots of those?

13:11.266 --> 13:15.202
I think so.
For you are one, and I another.

13:15.404 --> 13:22.003
And the whole court is imaginary
and all this is a dream.

13:33.522 --> 13:35.717
It's all I have.

13:48.771 --> 13:50.830
Then dream on.

14:08.957 --> 14:12.222
- Good night, Cardinal Pole.
- Wait.

14:12.928 --> 14:14.156
Wait.

14:20.569 --> 14:23.265
I've grown afraid of my own shadow.

14:30.479 --> 14:34.973
The papal seal.
The Holy Father blessed it himself.

14:37.486 --> 14:39.977
I feel safe when I have it.

14:44.126 --> 14:48.586
- Will you sleep outside the door?
- Yes, Your Eminence.

14:50.232 --> 14:53.998
- Good night, then.
- Good night, Eminence.

15:16.859 --> 15:18.588
Don't move.

15:22.431 --> 15:24.228
Traitor!

15:35.511 --> 15:36.500
He got away.

16:03.105 --> 16:04.868
Sweetheart?

16:05.607 --> 16:07.507
Is all well with you?

16:08.443 --> 16:09.774
Yes.

16:13.048 --> 16:14.572
No.

16:15.784 --> 16:18.446
For sometimes I think
I do not want this child in my belly.

16:19.188 --> 16:21.622
Oh, my love, why do you say so?

16:22.324 --> 16:26.954
For it will always be haunted
by the ghosts of other children.

16:27.696 --> 16:28.890
Murdered children.

16:30.966 --> 16:35.835
Unwanted, unloved
for the bloody memories it provokes.

16:38.207 --> 16:41.506
Better it was gone
before it was ever born.

17:12.875 --> 17:15.309
I have other ideas for the palace.

17:15.510 --> 17:20.378
I'll construct beautiful gardens
full of groves, hidden delves, paths.

17:21.215 --> 17:25.311
There will be a grove of Diana,
showing the goddess in her bath.

17:25.520 --> 17:29.115
Statues everywhere,
fountains spouting water...

17:29.324 --> 17:35.354
...whilst marble birds
pour forth water from their bills.

17:39.701 --> 17:41.362
What do you say, fool?

17:43.071 --> 17:45.733
I like it all. I like everything about it.

17:47.042 --> 17:50.978
Except the groves.
I don't like the groves.

17:51.179 --> 17:54.239
Or the fountains. Or the paths.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.883
Or the marble birds.

17:57.252 --> 17:59.277
Everything else I like.

17:59.488 --> 18:00.614
You don't understand.

18:02.524 --> 18:04.890
The French king has a palace
at Chambord...

18:05.093 --> 18:06.822
...which is the envy of all the world.

18:07.029 --> 18:11.591
But Nonsuch will trump it a hundred...
A thousand times.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.292
Then, in time...

18:15.504 --> 18:18.735
...like everything else,
it will dissolve away.

18:18.941 --> 18:23.674
Like the ruins of ancient Rome,
the Colossus of Rhodes...

18:23.879 --> 18:26.905
...all things tend towards their ruin...

18:27.115 --> 18:31.313
...even great houses
and the fools who build them.

18:32.387 --> 18:36.756
And so, in a little space,
there will indeed be Nonsuch Palace...

18:36.959 --> 18:38.290
...for it will all be gone.

18:39.361 --> 18:42.558
A vacancy, a nullity...

18:42.764 --> 18:46.666
...a green thought in a green shade.

18:47.602 --> 18:51.402
And yet people will say:

18:51.606 --> 18:54.803
"There once existed
a great palace there.

18:55.010 --> 19:00.004
A palace beyond beauty.
A palace beyond compare.

19:00.682 --> 19:03.480
And King Henry built it."

19:04.886 --> 19:07.684
And so it will still exist.

19:07.889 --> 19:09.322
True, true.

19:09.524 --> 19:13.051
The only things which exist
are in people's heads.

19:13.862 --> 19:19.027
And you never found a head so fine
but you could make it fly.

19:26.508 --> 19:28.203
Your turn.

19:40.222 --> 19:41.655
Don't play the fool.

19:41.857 --> 19:43.222
Why not?

19:43.425 --> 19:45.757
- You'll lose the game.
- Indeed.

19:45.961 --> 19:49.829
But, hey, I would much rather
lose the game than lose my head.

19:56.038 --> 19:57.835
Fool.

20:09.017 --> 20:12.145
Feel the weight. Hold it, hold it.

20:21.997 --> 20:26.696
Gawen, you're up late.
Does your Master Seymour know?

20:28.103 --> 20:29.695
What are you scared of?

20:32.407 --> 20:33.567
Poor Gawen.

20:36.845 --> 20:38.574
Who is he?

20:39.347 --> 20:43.943
Sir Gawen Carew.
One of Lord Seymour's retainers.

20:45.754 --> 20:47.847
Why was he killed?

20:49.691 --> 20:52.421
It may have been for a gambling debt,
my lord.

20:52.627 --> 20:56.256
- May have been?
- We are investigating, my lord.

20:56.465 --> 20:57.989
You have not found the killer?

20:59.634 --> 21:01.499
No, my lord.
Although it seems possible...

21:01.703 --> 21:04.900
...it was one of my Lord Sussex's
retainers.

21:06.408 --> 21:09.434
It's illegal to carry arms in court
while the king is in residence.

21:09.644 --> 21:12.909
- The penalties are severe.
- Yes, my lord.

21:13.215 --> 21:16.241
What about my friend Mr. Packington?
Have you not found his killer?

21:16.451 --> 21:19.386
- No, my lord.
- No.

21:19.721 --> 21:22.815
It seems to me, that as the man
appointed to keep order at court...

21:23.024 --> 21:25.049
...you are singularly failing
in your duties.

21:25.260 --> 21:28.661
I trust you will apprehend the villain
and prevent any further violence...

21:28.864 --> 21:31.992
...otherwise you will pay the price
for your failures.

21:44.513 --> 21:47.243
It's in order. You may take
Sir Francis through, Lady Bryan.

21:47.449 --> 21:51.112
- Thank you. This way, Francis.
- Mama.

21:53.922 --> 21:55.514
What's this?

21:55.724 --> 21:58.921
The king has given orders, personally,
that all the rooms, chambers...

21:59.127 --> 22:01.493
...and passages
around the prince's apartments...

22:01.696 --> 22:04.028
...are to be scrubbed with soap
three times daily.

22:04.232 --> 22:07.497
The prince also has his own kitchen
where all his meals are prepared...

22:07.702 --> 22:09.533
...now that he's weaned
from Mother Jack.

22:09.738 --> 22:11.763
Everything he might touch
has to be washed...

22:11.973 --> 22:15.067
...and everything he might eat,
tasted for poison.

22:15.277 --> 22:20.180
His personal chamberlain supervises
his meals, his robes and daily bath.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.407
He must be the cleanest baby
in England.

22:22.617 --> 22:25.609
He is the most precious baby
in England.

23:00.522 --> 23:04.322
- My lord.
- Thank you, Lady Bryan.

23:14.636 --> 23:15.933
Why have you come here?

23:16.304 --> 23:18.238
Has the king banished you
to the nursery...

23:18.440 --> 23:21.466
...for letting Cardinal Pole
slip through your fingers?

23:22.744 --> 23:28.239
His Majesty is anxious to assure
himself of his son's well-being.

23:28.450 --> 23:30.680
He has no need to be concerned.

23:30.885 --> 23:33.581
The protection of the prince
is also my first priority...

23:33.788 --> 23:36.382
...since he is also of my blood.

23:36.758 --> 23:40.660
I thank you, Sir Francis, in future,
to leave my nephew alone.

23:41.830 --> 23:44.298
And my wife too.

23:44.933 --> 23:47.094
Do I make myself clear?

23:57.879 --> 24:00.780
- The Lord Chancellor.
- Richie.

24:00.982 --> 24:02.813
Please take a seat.

24:03.652 --> 24:06.246
There's something new
I would like to discuss with you.

24:06.454 --> 24:09.617
You know that the king has seen fit
to start remodeling his palaces.

24:09.824 --> 24:11.758
Including the enlargement
at Hampton Court.

24:11.960 --> 24:15.225
My lord, I have already
released funds for the project.

24:15.430 --> 24:18.797
And also for the construction
of St. James's Palace.

24:20.802 --> 24:22.099
Here's a new one.

24:37.485 --> 24:39.385
But this is a fantasy work.

24:40.255 --> 24:42.052
It will cost a fortune.

24:43.992 --> 24:46.358
As a result of the dissolution
of the monasteries...

24:46.561 --> 24:48.426
...His Majesty has gained
a large fortune.

24:48.630 --> 24:52.498
Yes, but did you ever suppose
it would be squandered on fantasies?

24:53.268 --> 24:54.929
Can you not...

24:56.137 --> 24:58.833
...talk to him?
- Richie.

24:59.074 --> 25:02.373
What the king wills,
the king must have.

25:02.577 --> 25:04.272
He's not to be argued with
or crossed.

25:04.479 --> 25:07.175
He's still mourning
the death of his beloved wife.

25:07.816 --> 25:09.750
And he will talk to no one
but Will Somers.

25:10.452 --> 25:12.420
Will Somers?

25:13.421 --> 25:14.752
His fool?

25:16.157 --> 25:19.888
- He will talk to no one but his fool?
- It's not the first time.

25:20.362 --> 25:21.829
In extremis, always.

25:24.332 --> 25:27.165
- For how long?
- I don't know.

25:28.470 --> 25:31.530
But I wish he would come out,
for without him...

25:31.873 --> 25:34.000
...we're all gone to hell.

25:40.615 --> 25:44.847
Now, fool, fool. There's something else
we have to decide.

25:45.053 --> 25:48.022
We have to decide
which articles of faith...

25:48.223 --> 25:53.855
...and which commandments are best
for our new Church, our people.

25:54.062 --> 25:56.758
So they can walk in good ways.

25:59.768 --> 26:03.067
- Thou shalt not, what?
- Play the fool?

26:03.271 --> 26:06.399
- Covet thy neighbor's wife.
- Unless she's very pretty.

26:08.042 --> 26:14.413
Or his manservant,
maidservant, ox, ass.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.811
Or your neighbor's wife's ass.

26:26.227 --> 26:28.058
Don't be facetious, fool.

26:34.536 --> 26:37.164
Did you know...? Did you know...

26:37.705 --> 26:42.165
...that in Exodus
there are 613 commandments?

26:43.812 --> 26:47.339
Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

26:48.716 --> 26:53.585
Thou shall have three feast days
unto me a year.

26:53.788 --> 26:57.315
Thou shalt never vex a stranger.

26:57.525 --> 27:02.292
Whosoever lies with a beast
shall be surely put to death.

27:02.497 --> 27:05.466
Sheep shaggers. Pigeon fanciers.

27:12.841 --> 27:16.504
Thou shall not venerate
the vicar of Rome.

27:16.911 --> 27:18.606
Or lick his arse.

27:26.554 --> 27:30.183
- For thine is the kingdom...
- The power and the glory.

27:32.327 --> 27:35.956
- Amen.
- That's the doxology.

27:37.665 --> 27:39.656
Doxology?

27:40.768 --> 27:44.295
It's the dog's bloody bollocks.

27:57.418 --> 27:59.682
I miss her, Will.

28:02.090 --> 28:05.287
I miss her so much.

28:07.061 --> 28:09.052
I know.

28:09.764 --> 28:12.460
But this too shall pass.

28:15.803 --> 28:19.967
Why go on dwelling in darkness?

28:22.176 --> 28:24.770
You know that
the land of the wounded king...

28:24.979 --> 28:27.607
...is only a parched wasteland...

28:27.815 --> 28:31.842
...thirsting for rain
and Your Majesty's grace.

29:02.884 --> 29:06.047
Sir, there's a fight.
You'd best come quick.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.299
Whoever you are, hold!

29:28.509 --> 29:30.670
Put up your swords,
in the name of the king.

29:30.878 --> 29:32.675
You are committing treason.

29:32.880 --> 29:36.043
You, sir, give up your swords.

29:36.250 --> 29:39.845
I say, on pain of death,
give them up.

29:42.056 --> 29:45.514
You heard the sergeant.
Give me your sword.

29:49.430 --> 29:50.522
Very well.

30:09.384 --> 30:13.650
Go. Go now. Go.

30:29.303 --> 30:31.863
Put up your swords!

31:05.206 --> 31:08.039
Three days, three days.

31:08.242 --> 31:09.971
While the king's indisposed...

31:10.178 --> 31:13.113
...no one has the authority
to make decisions on his behalf.

31:13.314 --> 31:16.647
The prince, my nephew,
is in my custody...

31:16.851 --> 31:20.287
...and no one is or will be allowed to
see him without my written approval.

31:20.488 --> 31:23.218
He is the king's son
and the property of the state.

31:23.424 --> 31:25.915
- He is not your property, my lord.
- Hear, hear.

31:26.127 --> 31:27.890
Lord Privy Seal.

31:28.696 --> 31:30.391
My lords.

31:30.965 --> 31:32.489
Your Grace.

31:32.700 --> 31:35.931
- A kingdom without a king.
- Bite your tongue, sir.

31:36.137 --> 31:38.503
I beg you all,
can we not now come to order?

31:38.706 --> 31:41.231
By what right and by whose command,
Mr. Secretary...

31:41.442 --> 31:43.034
...do you summon
the king's council?

31:43.244 --> 31:44.233
Hear, hear.

31:44.445 --> 31:47.846
My Lord Hussey, as you well know,
the king is incommunicado.

31:48.049 --> 31:49.277
Then your only authority...

31:49.484 --> 31:52.453
...to put yourself above others
is a usurped one.

31:52.653 --> 31:55.087
As Lord Privy Seal,
I think I have the right...

31:55.289 --> 31:57.519
...and the responsibility
in loco parentis...

31:57.725 --> 32:00.421
...of summoning your lordships
to council.

32:00.628 --> 32:01.890
Gentlemen.

32:02.096 --> 32:05.930
Gentlemen, surely you can see
there must be a meeting of council.

32:06.134 --> 32:08.534
In absence of the king,
there has been malevolence...

32:08.736 --> 32:11.933
...and violence at court, including
the death of the sergeant at arms.

32:12.140 --> 32:13.835
I have heard
that your own servants...

32:14.041 --> 32:16.771
...are much involved in the violence,
Mr. Secretary.

32:18.079 --> 32:21.480
Some say that
they may have even provoked it.

32:25.953 --> 32:29.787
If that could be proved, I should rightly
forfeit your lordships' trust.

32:29.991 --> 32:32.118
But I can assure Your Grace
it is not true...

32:32.326 --> 32:34.920
...and others should look
to their own conscience.

32:40.268 --> 32:41.565
What do you mean by that?

32:41.769 --> 32:44.363
There are some who desire disorder
with all their hearts.

32:44.572 --> 32:46.301
Thinking to use it to their advantage.

32:46.507 --> 32:50.807
Mr. Cromwell, you presume too far
above your very base and low degree.

32:51.012 --> 32:54.175
Until the king is well, you will not
summon me anymore to anything.

32:54.382 --> 32:55.781
Hear, hear.

32:57.752 --> 32:59.185
Not even to a dogfight.

32:59.387 --> 33:00.513
I'm with you, my lord.

33:21.375 --> 33:24.708
For God's sake,
have you any news of the king?

33:25.112 --> 33:31.347
Yes, he's rewriting the Lord's Prayer
and the Ten Commandments.

33:31.552 --> 33:34.180
- What?
- Exactly.

33:45.032 --> 33:48.524
- How are the prawns?
- Delicious.

33:49.971 --> 33:53.202
I've warned Sir Francis Bryan
to stay away from you.

33:54.375 --> 33:55.569
Why?

33:55.776 --> 33:57.676
He's dangerous.

33:58.246 --> 34:00.840
Well, not to you, surely?
Not with the boy.

34:01.048 --> 34:03.448
The king listens to him.

34:03.651 --> 34:05.812
That makes him dangerous
to everyone.

34:07.154 --> 34:09.179
I shall have to destroy him.

34:11.225 --> 34:14.388
What a pity. He makes me laugh.

34:15.496 --> 34:18.192
I'm sure
he makes a lot of women laugh.

34:20.268 --> 34:23.931
That's a very small thing to you,
isn't it, Edward?

34:25.806 --> 34:28.831
I think there are
more important things, yes.

34:31.579 --> 34:33.638
No doubt you're right.

34:36.650 --> 34:41.588
But as long as you do,
don't expect me to be faithful to you.

34:50.831 --> 34:52.264
May I have some more prawns?

35:19.160 --> 35:21.628
Wakey wakey.

35:22.997 --> 35:25.989
His Majesty would like to see you.

35:27.735 --> 35:29.498
At once.

35:58.466 --> 36:02.163
- Master Cromwell.
- Majesty.

36:03.104 --> 36:04.969
How goes the world?

36:05.740 --> 36:08.038
The king of France
has written to Your Majesty...

36:08.242 --> 36:11.143
...to congratulate you
on the birth of your son.

36:15.383 --> 36:17.544
Tell Francis...

36:17.818 --> 36:19.809
...divine providence
has mingled my joy...

36:20.021 --> 36:22.421
...with the bitterness of death...

36:23.357 --> 36:28.124
...of her who brought me
such happiness.

36:34.935 --> 36:39.235
Tell Bishop Gardiner I wish to see him.
I wish to talk to him.

36:39.440 --> 36:41.772
Of course, Your Majesty.

36:42.777 --> 36:44.244
How's my son?

36:44.445 --> 36:46.538
Everything's been done
to protect the prince...

36:46.747 --> 36:49.580
...in strict accordance
with Your Majesty's instructions.

36:51.652 --> 36:53.813
I love that boy.

36:54.288 --> 36:56.756
If anything should ever happen
to him...

37:00.528 --> 37:04.123
- Majesty, I wonder...
- Wonder?

37:04.999 --> 37:09.732
Tell me, what do you wonder,
Mr. Cromwell?

37:12.773 --> 37:17.472
I wonder if Your Majesty could frame
your mind towards a new marriage.

37:17.845 --> 37:21.212
After all, however much is done
to protect the prince...

37:32.760 --> 37:36.856
I may frame my mind. Why not?

37:38.199 --> 37:39.291
What do you suggest?

37:40.367 --> 37:42.733
I took the liberty
of instructing our ambassadors...

37:42.937 --> 37:47.772
...in France and in the Low Countries
to begin making inquiries.

37:49.009 --> 37:50.601
And?

37:50.811 --> 37:54.907
The French have proposed two
possible consorts for Your Majesty.

37:55.116 --> 37:57.311
Margaret, the daughter of the king...

37:57.518 --> 38:00.351
...and Marie,
the daughter of the Duc de Guise.

38:00.554 --> 38:03.682
Our ambassador in France
sings the latter's praises...

38:03.891 --> 38:07.156
...although it seems she is
half promised to the king of Scotland.

38:16.937 --> 38:18.427
Majesty?

38:27.081 --> 38:28.708
How is the king?

38:28.916 --> 38:32.750
He has just lately emerged
from his seclusion.

38:33.621 --> 38:37.580
It is said that,
although he is little disposed to it...

38:37.791 --> 38:42.194
...the council is urging him to take
the extreme step of marrying again.

38:42.396 --> 38:44.125
Marriage?

38:48.802 --> 38:53.671
I don't suppose you've heard any more
about Don Luis and my own marriage?

38:54.108 --> 38:57.475
As to that, Lady Mary,
I am afraid I have no news for you...

38:58.078 --> 39:00.239
...whether good or bad.

39:00.447 --> 39:03.143
It seems perhaps
the issue is in abeyance...

39:03.350 --> 39:05.580
...at least for the time being.

39:06.353 --> 39:08.218
Perhaps it is my fate never to marry.

39:08.422 --> 39:10.185
No, gentle lady.

39:10.691 --> 39:14.354
No. I am sure
the king will make up his mind...

39:14.562 --> 39:17.326
...to arrange
a most brilliant marriage for you.

39:17.531 --> 39:21.365
If not to Don Luis,
then to someone even more eligible.

39:21.569 --> 39:24.367
I thought you said
Don Luis was incomparable.

39:24.572 --> 39:27.564
- Madam, I did not mean...
- No, you meant well.

39:28.242 --> 39:30.233
You always mean well.

39:34.148 --> 39:36.878
Jane's household
is now all broken up.

39:37.218 --> 39:40.745
- Where will you go, Lady Misseldon?
- To live with my mother.

39:40.955 --> 39:43.549
What about the young man
you were engaged to?

39:43.757 --> 39:45.782
Robert Tavistock?

39:45.993 --> 39:48.553
I think he is not so interested in me.

39:48.762 --> 39:50.889
Well, he's a fool, then.

39:51.265 --> 39:53.495
You're kind to think so, Sir Francis.

39:53.701 --> 39:55.726
Is he so foolish
he'll turn down a peerage...

39:55.936 --> 39:58.427
...and a gift
of one of the dissolved abbeys...

39:58.639 --> 40:00.766
...if he agrees to marry you?

40:01.542 --> 40:03.237
Majesty, I would think less of him...

40:03.444 --> 40:06.971
...if he needed to accept such gifts
in order to love me.

40:08.682 --> 40:11.879
Your Majesty has been
more than generous and gracious...

40:12.086 --> 40:14.179
...but I am settled in my plan
to go home...

40:14.388 --> 40:16.788
...and see what shall become of me.

40:17.858 --> 40:19.723
In my present state of mind...

40:19.927 --> 40:22.259
...you could not have said
a more admirable thing.

40:24.365 --> 40:26.799
You may leave with our love
and blessing.

40:32.539 --> 40:34.507
One more night.

41:00.034 --> 41:03.265
- The traitor Pole escaped you.
- Yes.

41:03.470 --> 41:07.201
We had other agents looking for him,
but he was smuggled off to Italy.

41:07.908 --> 41:10.536
No doubt he's sitting on the pope's lap
even now.

41:10.744 --> 41:12.473
His betrayal hurts me.

41:13.080 --> 41:16.311
Pity it is
that the folly of one brain-sick Pole...

41:16.517 --> 41:20.146
...or to say better, one witless fool,
should be the ruin of so great a family.

41:24.024 --> 41:29.052
Though I cannot touch him,
I swear I will make him eat his heart.

41:41.442 --> 41:44.775
The Holy Father mentioned you
in his prayers today.

41:44.978 --> 41:47.708
He thanked God
for your safe deliverance.

41:47.915 --> 41:50.440
I was sure I was going to die.

41:51.985 --> 41:54.977
Death is not ready for you yet.

41:56.323 --> 41:58.757
God has something else in mind.

42:00.361 --> 42:03.922
How else to explain
the miracle of your survival?

42:14.408 --> 42:17.571
My brother, Lord Montague,
has sent me a letter.

42:19.680 --> 42:21.170
Show me.

42:31.225 --> 42:34.126
"I send you God's blessing
and mine.

42:34.328 --> 42:38.822
Although my trust to have comfort
in you has turned to sorrow.

42:39.032 --> 42:40.260
It is incredible to me...

42:40.467 --> 42:44.369
...that by reason of a brief
sent to you by the bishop of Rome...

42:44.571 --> 42:47.438
...you should be resident with him
for this winter.

42:47.641 --> 42:51.304
If you keep that way,
then farewell all my hope...

42:51.512 --> 42:55.972
...and God save your mother
and all your family."

42:59.953 --> 43:01.784
What should I do?

43:15.736 --> 43:17.795
That letter was not written
by your brother...

43:18.439 --> 43:22.569
...but dictated to him by Cromwell,
the messenger of Satan.

43:29.683 --> 43:34.518
Never let the devil beguile you,
either with his threats or his promises.

43:35.255 --> 43:38.281
The price of your soul
is eternal vigilance.

43:38.492 --> 43:40.084
If you once let down your guard...

43:40.294 --> 43:43.991
...the devil will slip like a serpent
into your mouth...

43:44.198 --> 43:48.100
...and forever afterwards
he will speak for you.

43:51.405 --> 43:53.737
Lord Bishop, you and your committee
were asked...

43:53.941 --> 43:56.967
...to examine and determine
the doctrine of the Church of England.

43:57.177 --> 43:59.668
But you seem unable to agree
on anything.

44:00.314 --> 44:02.077
Your Majesty...

44:02.282 --> 44:07.083
...there continue to be some
fundamental theological differences...

44:07.287 --> 44:10.222
...between members of the committee.
- I'm aware of that.

44:10.424 --> 44:12.187
But I've grown very impatient...

44:12.392 --> 44:15.327
...and I will not tolerate
any more divisions.

44:15.662 --> 44:20.690
I have formulated
six fundamental doctrinal questions.

44:21.835 --> 44:25.168
The answers to these questions
will form the basis of our faith.

44:27.207 --> 44:30.938
Of course, as Your Majesty wishes.

44:31.512 --> 44:35.312
I shall go at once to Canterbury
and consult with the archbishop.

44:35.516 --> 44:37.211
My lord...

44:37.518 --> 44:38.815
...save yourself the journey.

44:40.554 --> 44:43.546
I think we understand each other
very well.

44:43.757 --> 44:47.056
Let's leave Archbishop Cranmer
to tend to his own garden.

44:47.261 --> 44:49.593
There's really no need
to bother him.

44:50.264 --> 44:51.595
Don't you agree?

45:04.211 --> 45:07.339
Your Majesty,
here are the Six Articles of Faith...

45:07.548 --> 45:10.381
...upon which Your Majesty's
Church of England...

45:10.584 --> 45:12.347
...is to be built and sustained.

45:12.553 --> 45:13.713
Read them.

45:13.921 --> 45:19.188
The first article concerns the truth
of the transubstantiation of God.

45:19.393 --> 45:23.124
By the consecration of the bread
and the wine at holy Mass...

45:23.330 --> 45:27.767
<i>... there takes place a change
in the whole substance of the bread...</i>

45:27.968 --> 45:30.528
<i>... into the substance
of the body of Christ our Lord...</i>

45:30.737 --> 45:33.831
...and a change
in the substance of the wine...

45:34.041 --> 45:36.805
...into the substance of his blood.

45:37.010 --> 45:40.468
The penalty for denying this
is death by burning...

45:41.048 --> 45:43.448
...even after recantation.

45:44.651 --> 45:46.744
The second article concerns...

45:46.954 --> 45:52.449
<i>... the withholding of the cup
from the laity during Communion.</i>

45:52.659 --> 45:54.593
<i>For if we offer them
the blood of Christ...</i>

45:54.795 --> 45:58.458
<i>... they will lose all their reverence
for the holy sacraments...</i>

45:58.665 --> 46:02.465
<i>... and the power of the blood
will be washed away.</i>

46:18.185 --> 46:23.020
The third article prescribes
the continued validity...

46:23.223 --> 46:27.592
...of the vows of celibacy
for all priests and nuns.

46:27.794 --> 46:29.227
<i>For does St. Paul not say:</i>

46:29.429 --> 46:34.457
<i>"He that is without a wife is solicitous
for the things of the Lord...</i>

46:34.668 --> 46:36.329
<i>... how he may please God.</i>

46:36.536 --> 46:41.064
<i>And he that is with a wife is solicitous
for the things of the world. "</i>

46:42.576 --> 46:47.377
<i>All priests who are now married
must forthwith desert their wives...</i>

46:47.581 --> 46:51.244
<i>... or face the penalty of death.</i>

47:00.127 --> 47:04.689
<i>The fourth article concerns the
observation of the vows of chastity.</i>

47:05.132 --> 47:07.726
A priest makes a vow of chastity...

47:07.934 --> 47:11.802
...and any violation of that vow
must surely be a sin against religion.

47:12.005 --> 47:17.170
To turn aside a vow to God
and to writhe in the pit of fornication...

47:17.377 --> 47:21.211
<i>... is to follow the devil willingly
into the mouth of hell.</i>

47:34.828 --> 47:37.319
<i>The fifth article herein decided...</i>

47:37.531 --> 47:41.695
<i>... is concerned with the continuation
of private Masses...</i>

47:41.902 --> 47:47.033
<i>... whereby good Christian people
may receive both godly...</i>

47:47.240 --> 47:51.734
<i>... and goodly consolation
and blessings for their souls.</i>

47:53.213 --> 47:57.980
<i>The sixth article confirms
the importance of confession.</i>

48:01.621 --> 48:04.419
Confess your sins to one another.

48:09.029 --> 48:12.294
<i>Anyone who disputes
against these articles...</i>

48:12.499 --> 48:14.831
...must now be considered
a heretic...

48:15.035 --> 48:19.438
...like those extreme Lutherans
who now roam this land.

48:19.639 --> 48:22.699
The punishment for transgression
is to be death by hanging...

48:22.909 --> 48:28.404
...drawing and quartering, as well as
forfeiture of estates and property.

48:28.615 --> 48:31.106
And any man who decides...

48:31.318 --> 48:34.446
...to try to flee England
in the face of these new articles...

48:34.654 --> 48:36.986
...will be considered
to have committed treason...

48:37.190 --> 48:42.924
...and suffer accordingly
the awful fate handed out to traitors.

48:44.731 --> 48:47.393
Thank you, my Lord Bishop.

49:01.381 --> 49:03.212
Your Eminences
are to be congratulated...

49:03.416 --> 49:05.941
...on your hard work
and manifest wisdom.

49:06.153 --> 49:09.316
Here we have six articles we may
adhere to with a clear conscience.

49:10.223 --> 49:12.657
There is one final amendment.

49:13.894 --> 49:19.025
Henceforth, the Lord's Prayer
will be altered to include the doxology:

49:19.399 --> 49:25.099
For thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory.

49:25.539 --> 49:26.528
Amen.

49:27.107 --> 49:29.337
Amen.

49:31.344 --> 49:34.404
My lords, eminences, Your Grace.

49:35.849 --> 49:38.682
Now that these matters
have been determined...

49:39.252 --> 49:42.153
...let us prosecute
with absolute diligence...

49:42.355 --> 49:45.654
...all those who stubbornly
stand against us.

49:59.072 --> 50:03.338
These aren't six articles,
they are a whip with six strings.

50:03.543 --> 50:06.842
Cranmer will have to send his wife
and son back to Germany...

50:07.047 --> 50:09.277
...or be burned.

50:09.616 --> 50:12.346
Oh, it's not just that, Mr. Rich.

50:12.586 --> 50:13.917
Private Masses, confession...

50:14.120 --> 50:17.089
...the body and the blood of Christ,
these are Catholic measures.

50:17.290 --> 50:21.056
He's rolled back the reforms.
It's the end of our Reformation.

50:21.261 --> 50:23.752
- Why?
- Because in his heart...

50:23.964 --> 50:27.297
...he has always been
a true Catholic.

50:27.634 --> 50:30.967
Excepting this one thing,
that he would have neither pope...

50:31.171 --> 50:35.403
...nor Luther,
nor any other man set above him.
