Previously on
"The Vampire Diaries"...

00:03.423 --> 00:04.795
Elena: Damon is gone.

00:04.796 --> 00:07.182
I want you to compel me
to forget that I ever loved him.

00:07.183 --> 00:10.017
- Who is Damon Salvatore?
- He's a monster.

00:10.018 --> 00:11.468
To get home, we'll
harness the power

00:11.469 --> 00:13.601
of the eclipse using
a mystical relic.

00:13.602 --> 00:14.701
No.

00:16.146 --> 00:18.584
[Dart gun fires]

00:18.585 --> 00:20.308
Tripp: Vampires
murdered my wife.

00:20.309 --> 00:22.754
I'm gonna get him to name
all his vampire buddies.

00:22.755 --> 00:24.122
Need any help?

00:24.123 --> 00:26.347
[Dart gun fires]

00:28.994 --> 00:31.163
If even just a small,
little part of you

00:31.164 --> 00:33.498
came back to check on me,

00:33.499 --> 00:35.223
then stay.

00:35.824 --> 00:38.136
Stefan: Not doing
so great, Damon.

00:38.137 --> 00:40.281
I'm lost, brother.

00:42.515 --> 00:43.976
It's kind of
a long story, brother,

00:43.977 --> 00:45.512
but I'm back.

00:53.426 --> 00:55.453
Ivy: Please just let me go.

00:55.454 --> 00:57.455
I know this may seem
a little barbaric,

00:57.456 --> 01:00.535
but I promise you,
it's nothing personal.

01:01.993 --> 01:03.827
Why are you doing this?

01:03.829 --> 01:05.664
It's a longer story,
we have no time for,

01:05.665 --> 01:09.543
but... trust me... you
don't want this life...

01:10.702 --> 01:12.570
If you can call it that.

01:12.571 --> 01:15.406
[Music playing]

01:18.201 --> 01:20.645
All right. Come on.

01:20.646 --> 01:24.081
Come on. Come on.

01:24.083 --> 01:27.251
Come on.

01:31.898 --> 01:35.260
What's that?
What is that? Aah!

01:35.261 --> 01:39.545
What is happening? Aah!

01:50.915 --> 01:55.612
- I missed you, too, buddy.
- I can't believe it.

01:57.315 --> 01:59.350
I thought you were gone.

01:59.351 --> 02:01.919
You didn't think I
was gone gone, huh?

02:01.920 --> 02:04.287
Promised you an
eternity of misery.

02:04.289 --> 02:06.457
Ha ha!

02:06.458 --> 02:07.904
He's back?

02:08.894 --> 02:11.996
- How?
- I don't know.

02:11.997 --> 02:13.531
Honestly, everything Stefan said

02:13.532 --> 02:16.233
after, "Damon is back,"
is kind of a blur.

02:16.234 --> 02:17.492
What about Bonnie?

02:17.493 --> 02:20.905
She sacrificed herself
so I can come back.

02:20.906 --> 02:22.440
I don't want anyone to know.

02:22.441 --> 02:23.706
There's no sense
making this harder

02:23.708 --> 02:25.009
than it already is.

02:25.010 --> 02:27.278
What are we gonna tell people?

02:27.279 --> 02:29.746
He said that she
wasn't over there.

02:29.748 --> 02:32.415
Where is there, exactly?

02:32.416 --> 02:35.619
- Mystic Falls, 1994?
- I know.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.121
A bunch of witches
were gonna get together

02:37.122 --> 02:39.290
and create some
space-time purgatory,

02:39.291 --> 02:40.791
you'd think they'd pick
a better year than

02:40.792 --> 02:43.227
the one that Kurt Cobain
killed himself.

02:43.228 --> 02:45.462
Whole thing was just
very depressing.

02:45.463 --> 02:47.765
So how did you get back?

02:47.766 --> 02:49.366
Long story... big
flash of light,

02:49.367 --> 02:50.734
two decades' worth of jet lag.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.469
I will explain all
of my adventures

02:52.470 --> 02:54.204
in that flannel
hellscape, but first,

02:54.205 --> 02:56.940
there's someone I got to go see.

02:56.941 --> 02:59.343
I don't want to see him.

02:59.344 --> 03:01.411
I get it,

03:01.412 --> 03:03.225
but that's how you
feel now, Elena.

03:03.715 --> 03:05.082
If you thought there
was even a chance

03:05.083 --> 03:07.217
you'd see Damon again,
you would have never

03:07.218 --> 03:09.593
asked me to compel away
your memories of loving him.

03:09.594 --> 03:11.822
She did what?

03:11.823 --> 03:14.490
She had Alaric do it.

03:14.492 --> 03:17.829
- Damon is going to kill me.
- You're unkillable.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.272
Doesn't mean he won't try.

03:19.273 --> 03:21.664
What do you think is gonna
happen when I do see him?

03:21.666 --> 03:23.667
I just need to see her, Stefan.

03:23.668 --> 03:25.335
Our eyes will meet,
fireworks will go off,

03:25.336 --> 03:27.779
and the balance of nature
will be restored.

03:28.850 --> 03:30.473
She loves me.

03:30.475 --> 03:33.109
- He's a psychotic killer.
- You onfeel that way

03:33.110 --> 03:34.744
because I erased
all the good parts.

03:34.745 --> 03:37.563
I don't see anything that
could balance out the bad.

03:38.706 --> 03:41.517
Promise me you won't
lift the compulsion.

03:41.519 --> 03:44.621
- Promise me.
- I won't, ok,

03:44.622 --> 03:46.623
not until you ask me to.

03:46.624 --> 03:49.392
- Thank you.
- But, Elena,

03:49.393 --> 03:51.244
I hope you ask me.

03:51.829 --> 03:54.297
I have to go. I have
a shift at the hospital.

03:54.298 --> 03:57.000
- Since when?
- Since Damon came back

03:57.001 --> 03:58.535
and I'm trying
desperately to avoid him.

03:58.536 --> 04:01.037
Fine, but if you're
avoiding people,

04:01.038 --> 04:03.440
add Jo to your list.

04:03.441 --> 04:04.841
I compelled her
to forget our date

04:04.842 --> 04:06.643
the other night,
and it didn't take.

04:06.644 --> 04:08.044
What do you mean,
it didn't take?

04:08.045 --> 04:11.281
Well, either she's on vervain
or there's some other reason,

04:11.282 --> 04:13.016
but she can't be compelled.

04:13.017 --> 04:18.654
- So see if you can find out why.
- Ok. Yeah. I will.

04:18.656 --> 04:21.357
Will you call Jeremy?

04:21.358 --> 04:24.460
I had to tell him about
Bonnie over the phone.

04:24.461 --> 04:28.530
You can imagine how that went.

04:30.299 --> 04:32.635
- Where are you going?
- Out.

04:32.636 --> 04:34.604
You promised me you'd help me
track down my relatives.

04:34.605 --> 04:37.306
Just... later, ok?

04:37.307 --> 04:39.876
Jeremy, you can't just say,
"Zach Salvatore was your dad.

04:39.877 --> 04:41.878
Too bad he's dead,"
and then, "peace out."

04:41.879 --> 04:43.713
I can't do this right now.

04:43.714 --> 04:45.414
What is so urgent to make you

04:45.415 --> 04:47.716
finally unglue your ass
from the couch?

04:47.718 --> 04:50.419
I know it's not school.
It's not work.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.954
If it's another girl,
I'd shower first.

04:56.726 --> 04:58.980
I just need to get out of here.

05:02.465 --> 05:04.723
[Door opens]

05:07.236 --> 05:10.104
Tripp's errand boy returns.

05:12.141 --> 05:15.611
Ooh, my bad.

05:15.612 --> 05:17.913
Heh. That's all right, mate.

05:17.914 --> 05:19.114
Just lean in,

05:19.115 --> 05:20.449
and I'll take it
right from the tap.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.484
I'll pass.

05:22.485 --> 05:24.886
Yeah? Come on.

05:24.888 --> 05:27.786
I'm gonna need my strength back
for when you help me escape.

05:27.787 --> 05:30.527
Sorry. If Stefan turned you in,
I'm guessing you deserved it.

05:31.796 --> 05:35.573
When did Stefan's moral compass
become the new true north?

05:36.392 --> 05:38.233
Wasn't he the one
who scurried off

05:38.234 --> 05:40.068
to some poxy,
little town while he

05:40.069 --> 05:41.437
let everyone believe
he was still

05:41.438 --> 05:43.539
searching for his brother?

05:43.540 --> 05:46.275
Not exactly the hero
move, if you ask me.

05:46.276 --> 05:48.143
Still, I think
the general population

05:48.144 --> 05:49.711
is safer with you in here.

05:49.712 --> 05:51.580
Yeah.
Probably right,

05:51.581 --> 05:53.815
well, except for Elena...

05:53.816 --> 05:56.919
Stefan, Caroline, you.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.820
What do you think
would happen if I

05:58.821 --> 06:01.757
were to tell your boss
about known vampires

06:01.758 --> 06:04.359
and their groupies?

06:04.360 --> 06:06.728
[Door opens]

06:06.729 --> 06:10.265
Well, Savannah
was a waste of gas.

06:10.266 --> 06:12.934
Minus a few blood bags,
the house you told us about

06:12.935 --> 06:14.636
was empty.

06:14.637 --> 06:17.572
Odd. Must have
smelled you coming.

06:17.573 --> 06:19.608
Hmm, would have been
a total bust,

06:19.609 --> 06:21.643
except I happened upon a girl

06:21.644 --> 06:24.513
that fit the description
that you gave me.

06:24.514 --> 06:27.182
That was near Whitmore,

06:27.183 --> 06:31.894
500 miles from where
you said she was gonna be.

06:32.355 --> 06:36.658
- Is this Ivy?
- That's the one.

06:36.659 --> 06:39.661
So I'm gonna give you
today to conjure up

06:39.662 --> 06:41.963
the location
of your vampire friends,

06:41.964 --> 06:45.333
or you and I are
gonna go sightseeing

06:45.334 --> 06:48.735
in Mystic Falls.

06:59.709 --> 07:00.949
Why didn't you tell us
Enzo has been

07:00.950 --> 07:02.450
locked up this whole time?

07:02.451 --> 07:04.485
Honestly, I didn't know
anybody was missing him.

07:04.486 --> 07:06.387
- Matt!
- I'm sorry.

07:06.388 --> 07:08.523
I was confused about
which vampires we like

07:08.524 --> 07:10.024
and which ones we don't.

07:10.025 --> 07:14.028
Ok. Well, what about Ivy?
Is she there, too?

07:14.029 --> 07:17.532
Tripp drove her and two others
across the border last night.

07:17.533 --> 07:20.201
Oh, God.

07:20.202 --> 07:22.503
Well, do you know
where Tripp is now?

07:22.504 --> 07:23.838
He's running down another lead,

07:23.839 --> 07:25.038
but he didn't
tell me what it was.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.541
Well, can you find out?

07:26.542 --> 07:28.075
We need to know who
his next target is.

07:28.076 --> 07:30.677
If Enzo talks,
it'll be you guys.

07:30.679 --> 07:32.546
Well, that's not going to happen

07:32.547 --> 07:34.348
because we're
busting him out, right,

07:34.349 --> 07:36.717
if for no other reason
than so I can kick his ass

07:36.718 --> 07:38.552
for getting caught
in the first place.

07:38.553 --> 07:40.254
You have any idea
how he even managed

07:40.255 --> 07:42.323
- to get his hands on it?
- He didn't.

07:43.993 --> 07:45.516
I turned him in.

07:53.434 --> 07:55.769
[Knocks on door]

07:57.404 --> 07:59.306
Who is it?

07:59.307 --> 08:01.775
Damon: Hey, it's me.

08:01.776 --> 08:05.145
I just wanted to talk.

08:05.146 --> 08:08.202
I can't, not now.

08:09.850 --> 08:13.487
Look. I know why
you did what you did.

08:13.488 --> 08:15.889
It's not real.

08:15.890 --> 08:19.819
You know what's real?
The way you felt for me.

08:21.183 --> 08:23.597
You once told me that
it was the most real thing

08:23.598 --> 08:25.826
you ever felt in your life.

08:30.433 --> 08:34.107
- Those feelings are gone.
- Oh, come on, Elena.

08:34.107 --> 08:36.765
You've compelled
enough people to know

08:38.317 --> 08:40.380
it's just a way
of covering the truth,

08:40.381 --> 08:43.482
and no matter how badly
you want it done,

08:43.484 --> 08:47.007
it doesn't make it
any less of a lie,

08:47.742 --> 08:50.256
you know?

08:58.598 --> 09:00.672
Oh, I hear you breathing.

09:02.893 --> 09:06.393
You have no idea how long
I've wanted to hear you breathe.

09:19.853 --> 09:22.721
Just open the door, Elena.

09:23.957 --> 09:27.292
Everything can go back
to the way it was.

09:32.665 --> 09:34.726
Just...

09:36.970 --> 09:39.099
Just open the door,
Elena, please...

09:42.215 --> 09:44.377
Or, at the very least,
step aside

09:44.378 --> 09:46.712
because I'm gonna
kick this door in.

09:55.822 --> 09:58.190
[Click]

10:23.415 --> 10:26.016
Stefan: Seriously?
You jumped out of a window?

10:26.017 --> 10:27.147
What if somebody saw you?

10:27.148 --> 10:30.218
I know, I know. I panicked.
I don't know.

10:30.219 --> 10:32.171
Look. He's been trapped
over there alone for months.

10:32.172 --> 10:33.472
He just wants to see you.

10:33.473 --> 10:35.974
Look. I get how I'm
supposed to feel,

10:35.975 --> 10:40.344
but I know how I actually feel,
and I'm happy now.

10:40.346 --> 10:42.447
What if I look at him
and my old feelings

10:42.448 --> 10:43.949
break through the compulsion?

10:43.950 --> 10:45.317
Well, they won't,
but even if they did,

10:45.318 --> 10:47.652
is that such a bad thing?

10:47.653 --> 10:52.124
Yeah. I started over
just like you did, ok?

10:52.125 --> 10:53.992
I made a smart choice for myself

10:53.993 --> 10:56.761
and for my future.

10:56.762 --> 10:59.931
Stefan, I kissed
Liam last night.

10:59.932 --> 11:03.502
Oh, please forget
that you told me that

11:03.503 --> 11:06.204
and definitely do not
tell Damon that.

11:06.205 --> 11:07.939
Because he's gonna
kill him, right,

11:07.940 --> 11:10.207
just like he killed my brother.

11:10.209 --> 11:12.711
I was gonna say because
he'll be heartbroken.

11:12.712 --> 11:14.012
Listen. What do you want to do?

11:14.013 --> 11:15.480
I mean, you have
to see him eventually.

11:15.481 --> 11:18.149
I know, but I just don't think

11:18.150 --> 11:20.652
eventually can
be today, all right?

11:20.653 --> 11:22.487
I'm not...

11:22.488 --> 11:26.691
I'm just not... ready.

11:26.692 --> 11:28.725
I got to go.

were here today.

11:51.083 --> 11:53.551
Yeah. No. I changed
my schedule around.

12:16.842 --> 12:18.709
Could ask you the same question.

12:18.710 --> 12:20.344
You can't be in here.

12:20.345 --> 12:23.180
From the look on your face,
either you're downloading porn

or you're not supposed
to be here, either.

What are you doing
in Tripp's office?

12:27.953 --> 12:29.453
What do you want?

12:29.454 --> 12:32.356
Information on some people
who used to live here.

12:32.357 --> 12:34.158
You know anything
about the Salvatores?

12:34.159 --> 12:35.626
Not really.

12:35.627 --> 12:38.939
Well, according to Jeremy,
Zach Salvatore was my dad.

12:38.940 --> 12:41.532
He supposedly died
from an animal attack,

12:41.533 --> 12:43.767
and, coincidentally,
so did my mom,

12:43.768 --> 12:45.803
but I've been paying attention.

12:45.804 --> 12:47.471
I know what that's code for,

12:47.472 --> 12:49.306
and your boss
seems to know a lot

12:49.307 --> 12:51.809
about homicidal wildlife, so...

12:51.810 --> 12:53.944
So you thought breaking
in here was a good idea.

12:53.945 --> 12:56.146
Guess we have that in common.

12:56.147 --> 12:58.282
Now, either you help me
or start coming up

12:58.283 --> 13:01.384
with a good lie when I tell
your boss you were snooping.

13:03.587 --> 13:07.457
Animal attacks are
filed over there.

13:11.361 --> 13:14.665
Professor Saltzman.

13:14.666 --> 13:18.368
What, couldn't compel
yourself a Ph.D.?

13:18.369 --> 13:21.850
- I can't believe you're back.
- I am. Heh.

13:25.253 --> 13:30.180
- So... how the hell are you?
- Well, let's see, Ric.

13:30.181 --> 13:31.615
I clawed my way

13:31.616 --> 13:33.517
out of some retro
pocket universe,

13:33.518 --> 13:35.886
only to find that I
needed to compel myself

13:35.887 --> 13:37.287
a new change of clothes

13:37.288 --> 13:39.990
because this
antimagic hamster ball

13:39.991 --> 13:41.958
is keeping me from going home,

13:41.959 --> 13:43.726
and then I find out
that my best friend,

13:43.728 --> 13:45.395
rather than doing
anything about it,

13:45.396 --> 13:48.398
decided that it was
the best use of his time

13:48.399 --> 13:50.967
to compel my beautiful
and lovely girlfriend

13:50.968 --> 13:53.069
to forget that
she ever loved me.

13:53.070 --> 13:56.338
Heh. I'm great, Ric.
Thanks for asking.

13:56.340 --> 13:57.641
Look, Damon.

13:57.642 --> 13:59.509
I know she was a train
wreck without me, ok,

13:59.510 --> 14:02.712
but a full mind erase,
seriously?

14:02.713 --> 14:07.283
She loved you too much,
and it was killing her.

14:07.284 --> 14:09.546
Well, I'm flattered,

14:10.020 --> 14:11.866
but I'm back.

14:12.523 --> 14:15.358
So let's get this uncompulsion

14:15.359 --> 14:16.893
on the books, huh?

14:16.894 --> 14:21.030
Fine, as soon as Elena
tells me that what she wants.

14:21.031 --> 14:24.930
Right.
Here's the thing.

14:24.931 --> 14:27.714
She's not gonna want
to be uncompelled

14:27.715 --> 14:31.808
if she can't remember why
she'd want to be uncompelled.

14:31.809 --> 14:33.876
Mm-hmm. Chicken, egg.

14:33.877 --> 14:37.094
I know, and I'm sorry.

14:37.095 --> 14:41.850
Sorry? She won't
even see me, Ric.

14:41.852 --> 14:45.688
I get it, Damon,
but she's happy,

14:45.689 --> 14:47.623
and I'm not gonna
take that away from her

14:47.624 --> 14:49.592
until she asks me to.

14:49.593 --> 14:51.194
It's not like I don't
want Elena to be happy.

14:51.195 --> 14:53.662
I just want her
to be happy with me.

14:57.537 --> 14:58.867
Right.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.414
Look. Enzo wasn't being careful.

15:11.415 --> 15:12.615
Tripp would've
caught him eventually,

15:12.616 --> 15:14.283
and that meant danger
for all of us.

15:14.284 --> 15:16.352
Right. So you handed Enzo over

15:16.353 --> 15:17.953
so we wouldn't
be targeted, and now

15:17.954 --> 15:20.589
you're rescuing him
so we won't be targeted.

15:20.590 --> 15:21.857
Way to go.

15:21.858 --> 15:22.958
Well, I thought Tripp
was gonna kill him.

15:22.959 --> 15:25.294
I didn't think he was gonna
keep him alive for information.

15:25.295 --> 15:27.363
Oh, well, in that case,
sounds like you

15:27.364 --> 15:29.064
were just being practical.

15:29.065 --> 15:31.438
- So did you rat out Ivy, too?
- What?

15:31.439 --> 15:32.968
Well, you didn't want
to deal with her anymore.

15:32.969 --> 15:34.269
You wanted her gone,
and now she is.

15:34.270 --> 15:35.638
You know what?

15:35.639 --> 15:36.590
You really should write
Tripp a thank-you note.

15:36.592 --> 15:38.574
Hold on a second.
Enzo turns Ivy, right?

15:38.575 --> 15:40.609
A hunter kills her,
and yet I'm the bad guy?

15:40.610 --> 15:42.111
I'm not the one
threatening to turn in

15:42.112 --> 15:44.038
other vampires to
save his own skin.

15:44.039 --> 15:46.081
The only one who's
turned in other vampires

15:46.082 --> 15:48.117
is you, Stefan.

15:48.118 --> 15:49.718
That's why you're helping...

15:49.719 --> 15:52.374
Guilt for getting
Damon's friend captured.

15:52.375 --> 15:55.357
Yeah. Damon is my brother,
and I gave up on him first.

15:55.358 --> 15:56.491
Enzo didn't.

15:56.492 --> 15:57.626
So if rescuing his idiot friend

15:57.627 --> 15:58.961
is gonna somehow
make it up to him,

15:58.962 --> 15:59.995
that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

15:59.996 --> 16:01.330
Great. Good for you.

16:01.331 --> 16:02.598
Let me know when you
figure out how you're

16:02.599 --> 16:04.533

What is it made of?

16:41.571 --> 16:43.538
No idea.

16:43.539 --> 16:45.740
While you're here, can I get
your opinion on something?

Sure. Yeah.

16:47.877 --> 16:50.445

massive internal hemorrhaging,

16:50.446 --> 16:52.813
multiple bone fractures.

16:52.815 --> 16:55.009
She was a victim
at the corn maze.

16:56.886 --> 16:58.852
Where is she?

16:58.854 --> 17:01.489
Probably freshman lit.

17:01.490 --> 17:03.391
I don't get it.

17:03.392 --> 17:05.026
Neither do I.

17:05.027 --> 17:06.961
See, the patient
was never admitted,

17:06.962 --> 17:08.963
even with such
extensive injuries.

17:08.964 --> 17:10.992
Liam said you treated
her at the scene.

17:10.993 --> 17:12.666
That's a pretty good
save for someone

17:12.667 --> 17:14.335
with half a semester of pre-med.

17:14.336 --> 17:17.605
Yeah, you know, I think
they were exaggerating

17:17.606 --> 17:19.574
how bad off she was.

17:19.575 --> 17:21.843
It was dark, and, yeah,
there was a lot of blood...

17:21.844 --> 17:25.413
Don't. I know what Alaric is.
And I know what you are.

17:25.414 --> 17:27.482
If any more blood
bags go missing,

stalking my sister.

Technically, I'm lying in wait.

18:32.971 --> 18:35.826
Why didn't Bonnie come back?

18:39.030 --> 18:41.298
Why didn't she come back?

18:43.201 --> 18:45.870
Because she wasn't there.

18:45.871 --> 18:47.904
It was just me.

18:55.947 --> 18:57.982
You know I paid her cell bill

18:57.983 --> 18:59.784
so I could call her
phone and hear her say

18:59.785 --> 19:02.185
the same 6 words every day?

19:03.321 --> 19:07.258
Sounds good.
I'll give it a call.

19:07.259 --> 19:10.393
Why? She hated you.

19:14.465 --> 19:16.667
Bonnie wasn't there
with me, Jeremy,

19:16.668 --> 19:20.770
because she found peace.

19:23.272 --> 19:26.209

Pretty sure you weren't looking
for stevia in my coffee.

With Alaric, I wasn't
100% certain

19:43.195 --> 19:45.095
he tried to compel me,
but then I remembered

19:45.096 --> 19:47.564
I have really crappy
luck in my love life.

19:47.565 --> 19:49.733
So of course my hot,

- Busy.

there's food trays

that need clearing.

That's it?
You're gonna let me stay?

20:00.044 --> 20:02.713
You saved that girl
instead of feeding on her.

20:02.714 --> 20:06.583
- That's good enough for me.
- You're not even afraid,

20:06.584 --> 20:09.253
not ever fazed, for that matter.

There's only one thing
that can resist compulsion

without needing vervain,
and that's a witch.

questions about you.

if he wants to avoid
a complicated relationship,

he doesn't have to hide
behind compulsion to do it.

I didn't grow up here.

25:32.527 --> 25:34.327
but now I have to save him

25:34.328 --> 25:35.986
from a vampire hunter
before he's driven

25:35.987 --> 25:38.565
across an antimagic
border and killed again.

25:38.566 --> 25:40.967
So here's some friendly advice.

25:40.968 --> 25:43.036
It's probably
a good idea to stay

25:43.037 --> 25:45.738
as far away from me as possible.

25:57.517 --> 26:00.387
Damon: Uh...

26:00.388 --> 26:04.391
- Morning, sunshine.
- Enzo?

26:04.392 --> 26:07.894
Well, this brings back memories.

26:07.895 --> 26:10.096
I'm glad you found
a way back, mate.

26:10.097 --> 26:12.031
Afraid it's gonna be a
short reunion, through.

26:12.032 --> 26:15.335
We're headed to Mystic Falls,
known for its bridges;

26:15.336 --> 26:17.103
quaint, small-town charm;

26:17.104 --> 26:20.540
and a really big
vampire bug zapper.

26:20.541 --> 26:23.376
Stefan could've told me
there was a hunter in town.

26:23.377 --> 26:25.578
It probably slipped
his mind because he's

26:25.579 --> 26:29.415
responsible for my
return to incarceration.

26:29.416 --> 26:31.184
Why would he do that?

26:31.185 --> 26:33.386
Probably jealous of my accent.

26:33.387 --> 26:34.787
Eh, maybe he did it
because I killed

26:34.788 --> 26:36.389
his new girlfriend.

26:36.390 --> 26:38.891
Yeah.
That'll do it.

26:38.892 --> 26:41.994
[Tires screech]

26:41.995 --> 26:43.963
Sorry, mom.

26:43.964 --> 26:47.666
Elena is auditioning
for "Top Gear."

26:47.668 --> 26:50.903
Yeah. Ok.

26:50.904 --> 26:52.438
Bye.
[Beep]

26:52.439 --> 26:54.273
So my mom is
shutting down route 13.

26:54.274 --> 26:55.808
Tripp will have to double back,

26:55.809 --> 26:57.376
and there's only two other
ways across the border.

26:57.377 --> 27:01.133
Do you have a tire
preference... front, back?

27:01.134 --> 27:03.782
No? Ok.

27:05.584 --> 27:08.821
I think this sells a spinout.

27:08.822 --> 27:11.990
What do you think?
Elena?

27:14.154 --> 27:16.400
I want my memories back.

27:16.763 --> 27:19.832
Wait. What?

27:19.833 --> 27:22.268
I made up my mind.

27:22.269 --> 27:24.403
If Damon survives this,

27:24.404 --> 27:28.507
then I want Alaric
to uncompel me.

27:28.508 --> 27:32.011
I mean, I can't imagine
ever loving him.

27:32.012 --> 27:36.348
I also can't ignore

27:36.349 --> 27:40.058
the parts I don't like
just to avoid the truth.

27:40.059 --> 27:42.821
I mean, how would I
make any decisions

27:42.822 --> 27:46.524
if I only know half the story?

28:08.146 --> 28:10.849
You don't have to take
apart the whole engine.

28:10.850 --> 28:13.984
We just need to lure
Tripp in so we can grab them.

28:16.888 --> 28:19.405
You know, it's not your fault.

28:19.892 --> 28:22.293
Pretty much is.

28:22.853 --> 28:25.029
Look. You're not
the only one who gave up.

28:27.839 --> 28:29.823
Every second
for the last 4 months,

28:29.824 --> 28:31.903
all I could think about
was when I'm gonna get

28:31.904 --> 28:34.072
my next sip of blood,
when am I gonna

28:34.073 --> 28:36.841
screw up and hurt somebody,

28:36.842 --> 28:38.176
why did I come back to life

28:38.177 --> 28:41.079
just to be this thing,

28:41.080 --> 28:44.082
that I used to hunt vampires

28:44.083 --> 28:45.977
and suddenly, I was one.

28:48.067 --> 28:50.388
Searching for Damon
was the only thing

28:50.389 --> 28:53.091
that could take
my mind off of it,

28:53.092 --> 28:57.562
but I was basically
going through the motions

28:57.563 --> 29:02.934
as a distraction because,
honestly, Stefan,

29:02.935 --> 29:05.802
I'd given up, too.

29:10.908 --> 29:13.745
There.

29:13.746 --> 29:15.847
That's him. You should
stay in the car.

29:15.848 --> 29:18.248
- He knows what you look like.
- He thinks I'm on his side.

29:18.250 --> 29:19.917
Yeah, unless Enzo
told him different.

29:19.918 --> 29:22.152
Go tell Elena he's here.

29:24.255 --> 29:26.756
[Whistles]

29:31.229 --> 29:33.364
Evening.

29:33.365 --> 29:35.399
Tried to get my buddy
to a bachelor party,

29:35.400 --> 29:36.934
and our car just stopped.

29:36.935 --> 29:38.536
You think you can help us out?

29:38.537 --> 29:40.471
Uh, don't know
anything about cars.

29:40.472 --> 29:41.772
Yeah.

29:41.773 --> 29:44.809
Well, maybe you could
give us a ride, then.

29:44.810 --> 29:46.143
Who's that?

29:46.144 --> 29:49.947
Ric. He's up to something.

29:49.948 --> 29:52.817
Better be good.
Bastard owes me.

29:52.818 --> 29:55.519
Sorry. In a bit of a hurry.

29:55.520 --> 29:58.335
Yeah. So are we.

30:00.458 --> 30:02.193
Uh!

30:02.194 --> 30:05.328
Uh! Ooh!

30:18.309 --> 30:20.777
Oh!

30:26.133 --> 30:31.792
Uh! Uh! Ugh! Agh!

30:33.879 --> 30:35.713
Elena, on phone: Stefan.

30:38.417 --> 30:40.085
Stefan, what's happening?

30:40.086 --> 30:43.389
Damon and Alaric
are across the border.

30:43.390 --> 30:46.025
I got to go.
[Beep]

30:46.026 --> 30:48.426
Oh, my God.

30:56.301 --> 31:02.040
Agh! Ugh! Aagh!

31:02.041 --> 31:04.643
Ah!

31:04.644 --> 31:08.913
[Panting]

31:09.781 --> 31:12.684
Damon: I came back for this?

31:12.685 --> 31:14.620
Consumption wasn't much fun

31:14.621 --> 31:17.388
the first time around, either.

31:21.259 --> 31:22.593
[Coughing]

31:24.262 --> 31:26.131
It's ok. I'm here.

31:26.132 --> 31:27.299
How?

31:27.300 --> 31:29.935
Followed you like
a crazy stalker,

31:29.936 --> 31:31.736
not one of my finer moments.

31:31.737 --> 31:35.258
No, no. Get him.

31:47.485 --> 31:50.755
You have to get me
across the border.

31:50.756 --> 31:53.658
It's stripping away
the magic. I'll die.

31:53.659 --> 31:55.493
You'll die if I move you.

31:55.494 --> 31:57.261
I have to stop the bleeding.

31:57.263 --> 31:58.897
Nicked your descending aorta.

31:58.898 --> 32:00.665
I know.
That's what killed me.

32:00.666 --> 32:02.833
You didn't have me
back then, did you,

32:02.835 --> 32:05.069
and you didn't have
hemostatic gauze.

32:05.070 --> 32:08.972
Get up.
Come on. Get up.

32:17.215 --> 32:18.816
Ugh!

32:18.817 --> 32:21.285
[Coughing]

32:21.286 --> 32:24.222
[Panting]

32:24.223 --> 32:26.791
What's happening?

32:26.792 --> 32:29.260
You still with me?

32:29.261 --> 32:30.995
While I'm sealing this wound,

32:30.996 --> 32:32.497
I want you to think
about how you tried

32:32.498 --> 32:34.165
to compel one of the
smartest women on campus

32:34.166 --> 32:36.299
to forget about
her date with you,

32:36.301 --> 32:38.669
the date where I
single-handedly saved

32:38.670 --> 32:43.507
dozens of lives without
smearing my makeup.

32:43.508 --> 32:47.211
Alaric? Hang on.

32:47.212 --> 32:49.513
Stay with me.

32:49.514 --> 32:52.883
Come on. Gonna get
that heart pumping.

32:52.884 --> 32:57.154
You don't get to have
the last word with me.

32:57.155 --> 32:59.055
Alaric!

33:01.058 --> 33:03.660
Alaric!

33:10.434 --> 33:13.204
Jo: Stay with me.

33:13.205 --> 33:16.072
Come on.

33:17.775 --> 33:19.677
[Gasps]

33:19.678 --> 33:22.246
[Gasps] Ah...

33:22.247 --> 33:24.915
Ah...

33:24.916 --> 33:28.819
So... so...
Something is wrong.

33:28.820 --> 33:30.353
- Don't move.
- No.

33:30.355 --> 33:32.723
Something is wrong.

33:32.724 --> 33:34.892
I'm not supposed to be alive.

33:34.893 --> 33:36.960
There's no reason
you shouldn't be.

33:36.961 --> 33:38.829
I sealed the wound.

33:38.830 --> 33:42.298
We just have to get you
to the hospital.

33:49.015 --> 33:51.146
Yeah. I'll tell her.

33:51.147 --> 33:52.847
Thanks.

33:52.848 --> 33:55.016
[Beep]

33:55.017 --> 33:57.652
I was just at route 9,

33:57.653 --> 33:59.387
and there was a crash,
but they weren't there.

33:59.388 --> 34:00.488
Yeah. I know.

34:00.489 --> 34:02.057
They had to get out of there.

34:02.058 --> 34:04.459
What happened?

34:04.460 --> 34:07.595
Stefan said that...

34:07.596 --> 34:10.063
What, Caroline?
What?

34:12.300 --> 34:16.437
Alaric crossed the border,

34:16.438 --> 34:19.706
but Jo was there,
and she saved him.

34:21.042 --> 34:24.045
So he's ok.

34:24.045 --> 34:26.014
That means he's ok, right?

34:26.014 --> 34:28.349
Yeah, Elena.
He's ok.

34:28.350 --> 34:32.620
Then why do you have
that look on your face?

34:32.621 --> 34:35.056
What happened, Caroline?

34:35.056 --> 34:36.991
All the magic stripped away,

34:36.992 --> 34:40.728
but Jo saved him
just before he died.

34:40.728 --> 34:42.496
What?

34:42.498 --> 34:45.733
I don't know what
that means, Caroline.

34:45.734 --> 34:49.536
Alaric is not a vampire
anymore, Elena.

34:49.538 --> 34:51.605
He's human.

34:56.744 --> 34:58.913
Thanks for the ride.
Yeah.

34:58.914 --> 35:00.414
I thought I'd save you
the trouble

35:00.415 --> 35:02.583
of having to boost another car.

35:02.584 --> 35:04.352
That was almost funny.

35:04.353 --> 35:07.054
Hope for you yet, Donovan.

35:07.055 --> 35:10.057
If I told you I knew
about your family,

35:10.058 --> 35:12.059
promise to take a little
friendly advice?

35:12.060 --> 35:13.561
Hang on.

35:13.562 --> 35:14.995
You know who my family is?

35:14.996 --> 35:16.230
Read any history book

35:16.231 --> 35:17.865
about the town's
founding members.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.667
The guys that live in this house

35:19.668 --> 35:22.502
are Damon and Stefan Salvatore.

35:22.504 --> 35:24.772
Why are you just
telling me this now?

35:24.773 --> 35:27.675
Because...

35:27.676 --> 35:30.110
They're vampires,
and wherever they go,

35:30.111 --> 35:31.945
death and pain always follow.

35:31.946 --> 35:34.048
So if you're looking for family,

35:34.049 --> 35:36.083
you're not gonna find it here.

35:36.084 --> 35:37.551
Do yourself a favor and get

35:37.552 --> 35:39.553
as far away from
this place as you can.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.287
Jeremy: Come on!

35:43.323 --> 35:46.827
No. Damn it!

35:46.828 --> 35:48.595
Jer...

35:48.596 --> 35:51.031
I keep trying
to cancel Bonnie's phone,

35:51.032 --> 35:54.434
but I can't without her pin.

35:54.435 --> 35:56.470
Why can't I remember her pin?

35:56.471 --> 35:58.971
Uh!

36:04.778 --> 36:06.480
Uh! Uh!

36:06.481 --> 36:08.148
Get off! Get off!

36:08.149 --> 36:10.916
Hey, it's ok.
No, it's not!

36:14.488 --> 36:16.755
She's gone.

36:17.824 --> 36:20.159
Bonnie is gone.

36:22.929 --> 36:27.134
Jo is a keeper.
How does it feel?

36:27.135 --> 36:29.336
Oh, it hurts a lot.

36:29.337 --> 36:31.872
Well, it's too bad there aren't
any vampires in Mystic Falls

36:31.873 --> 36:33.640
to help heal you.

36:33.641 --> 36:37.010
Well, I think they got me
on a morphine drip.

36:37.011 --> 36:39.821
It's the next best thing.

36:41.168 --> 36:44.984
Elena, I'm so sorry.

36:44.985 --> 36:46.853
No. No, Alaric.

36:46.854 --> 36:49.923
I'm just glad that you're ok.

36:49.924 --> 36:52.192
I mean, up until an hour ago,

36:52.193 --> 36:55.028
I didn't even want
my memories to return.

36:55.029 --> 36:57.263
I was the one who made
the choice to lose them.

36:57.264 --> 37:00.333
Now I have to live with the fact

37:00.334 --> 37:04.037
that you can't give
them back to me.

37:04.038 --> 37:06.005
I know how much you
hated being a vampire.

37:06.006 --> 37:09.509
So I'm just glad one of
us got what we wanted.

37:09.510 --> 37:11.405
And what is it that you want?

37:14.058 --> 37:17.717
To be able to look
Damon in the eye,

37:17.718 --> 37:19.652
knowing all that I know

37:19.653 --> 37:22.832
and all that I don't,
and...

37:25.689 --> 37:28.461
See how I feel about him.

37:28.462 --> 37:32.532
I want to trust how I feel.

37:32.533 --> 37:36.604
I hope that you can.
Good luck, ok?

This hospital sucks.

37:43.450 --> 37:45.619
I can't believe anyone
actually makes it out alive.

37:45.620 --> 37:46.871
They usually don't.

37:46.872 --> 37:49.048
I'm having you transferred
to Whitmore ASAP.

37:49.049 --> 37:51.258
Thank you.

37:51.259 --> 37:53.596
Just doing my job.

37:53.597 --> 37:56.065
Hey...

37:56.886 --> 37:59.702
You did more than that.

37:59.703 --> 38:01.231
You gave me back my life.

38:02.624 --> 38:05.506
Thank you.

38:07.884 --> 38:10.579
[Music playing]

38:10.580 --> 38:14.849
I was this close, this close.

38:14.851 --> 38:17.719
I know. I'm sorry.

38:17.720 --> 38:20.054
Oh, I got it.
Everybody is sorry.

38:20.056 --> 38:21.757
You're sorry you gave up on me,

38:21.758 --> 38:23.992
sorry you turned Enzo
in to that hunter guy.

38:23.993 --> 38:25.360
Ric is sorry for the compulsion.

38:25.361 --> 38:26.762
I'm sure if Elena
could remember anything,

38:26.763 --> 38:28.095
she'd be sorry, too.

38:28.097 --> 38:30.232
You got to understand
how hard it was for her.

38:30.233 --> 38:33.101
I am so tired of hearing
about how hard it was for her.

38:33.102 --> 38:35.428
It was hard for me, as well.

38:35.429 --> 38:37.606
At least you knew
you had a home to come back to.

38:37.607 --> 38:40.288
She didn't have anything.
To her, you were just gone.

38:41.144 --> 38:42.877
Guess I still am.

38:45.380 --> 38:48.227
Ric said she's happy without me
since she's erased me.

38:48.228 --> 38:51.553
You know what? I don't
want her to be happy.

38:51.554 --> 38:55.423
I want her to be
miserable just like I am.

38:55.424 --> 38:57.592
You done?

38:57.593 --> 38:59.427
- Yeah. I'm done.
- Good.

38:59.428 --> 39:01.563
Now quit stalling.

39:01.564 --> 39:03.965
There's a girl
you need to go see.

39:03.966 --> 39:06.601
What if it doesn't work?

39:06.602 --> 39:08.103
What if what we had
isn't strong enough

39:08.104 --> 39:09.903
to break the compulsion?

39:09.905 --> 39:14.141
You're not gonna find out
just sitting there, are you?

39:15.827 --> 39:19.013
Here goes everything.

39:19.014 --> 39:21.916
[Music playing]

39:21.917 --> 39:24.451
[Sighs]

39:28.715 --> 39:31.124
Hey.

39:32.427 --> 39:35.096
Hey.

39:35.097 --> 39:37.699
So...

39:37.700 --> 39:39.767
Am I your last stop

39:39.768 --> 39:42.570
on the Stefan Salvatore
apology tour?

39:42.571 --> 39:47.741
Could we just get
past this, please?

39:48.150 --> 39:52.246
- I'm trying to.
- Look, Caroline.

39:52.247 --> 39:54.515
What do you want me to do, huh?

39:54.516 --> 39:55.983
Stop making me guess and tell me

39:55.984 --> 39:58.652
so we can go back to
being friends again.

39:59.754 --> 40:02.557
Yeah. Well, that's
the thing, Stefan.

40:02.558 --> 40:05.756
After all of this, I...

40:07.762 --> 40:10.450
I don't want
to be friends anymore.
