WEBVTT

01:53.280 --> 01:54.740
Twin Peaks Sheriff's Station.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.492
Is that you, Lucy?

01:57.785 --> 01:59.245
Director Cole.

01:59.370 --> 02:01.997
You've been there
all through the years, Lucy?

02:02.123 --> 02:03.415
<i>Well, actually,</i>

02:03.541 --> 02:05.084
I have gone home,

02:05.209 --> 02:07.837
and Andy and I have
taken some vacations.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.172
One year, we went to Bora-Bora.

02:20.266 --> 02:22.059
Would you like to speak
with Sheriff Truman?

02:22.184 --> 02:24.562
Yes, Lucy.
I'm returning his call.

02:26.438 --> 02:28.315
Okay, I'll connect you!

02:30.860 --> 02:32.736
<i>Sheriff Truman?</i>

02:32.862 --> 02:36.198
<i>FBI Director Gordon Cole
is on line one.</i>

02:37.116 --> 02:38.576
<i>That's the blinking one,</i>

02:38.701 --> 02:40.494
<i>the one that's blinking
right now.</i>

02:44.081 --> 02:44.957
Hello.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.709
It's Gordon Cole, Harry,

02:46.834 --> 02:48.627
<i>returning your call.</i>

02:48.752 --> 02:50.588
Uh, no, no, this is, uh,

02:50.713 --> 02:53.382
Sheriff Frank Truman,
Harry's brother.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.884
Where's Harry?

02:55.009 --> 02:56.135
<i>Harry's sick.</i>

02:56.260 --> 02:58.554
He's, uh, in the doctor's care.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.182
I'm sorry to hear that.

03:01.307 --> 03:03.601
I'll give him your regards, sir.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.270
What've you got for me, Frank?

03:08.439 --> 03:09.648
Uh...

03:11.066 --> 03:13.152
I just thought
you should know this.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.863
Uh, it's gonna sound strange.

03:17.072 --> 03:18.574
Something's been found,

03:18.699 --> 03:22.870
something Deputy Chief Hawk found.

03:22.995 --> 03:27.708
Missing pages from
a certain Laura Palmer's diary

03:27.833 --> 03:30.336
<i>that could indicate</i>

03:30.461 --> 03:32.755
<i>two Coopers.</i>

03:32.880 --> 03:36.217
I don't know any more
than this, but, uh,

03:36.342 --> 03:38.510
I-I just thought
you should know it.

03:38.636 --> 03:40.596
<i>Uh, maybe it means
something to you.</i>

03:42.348 --> 03:44.475
Thank you very much, Frank.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.687
Although I can't comment
on this information,

03:48.812 --> 03:52.358
I want you to know
I really appreciate it.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.110
All right, Director Cole,

03:55.236 --> 03:58.072
uh, I understand.

03:58.197 --> 03:59.448
<i>And all the best</i>

03:59.573 --> 04:02.743
to you
and all the best to Harry.

04:03.619 --> 04:06.330
Thank you, sir.
I'll pass it on.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.260
Tammy.

04:21.262 --> 04:22.471
Case number one.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.223
This started the whole thing.

04:25.391 --> 04:26.934
Nineteen seventy-five.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.770
Two young field agents
investigate a murder

04:29.895 --> 04:32.231
in Olympia, Washington.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.775
They arrive at a motel
to arrest a suspect

04:34.900 --> 04:35.901
named Lois Duffy.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.863
They hear a gunshot outside
her room and kick the door in.

04:40.739 --> 04:43.158
They find two women inside,

04:43.284 --> 04:46.495
one on the floor dying from
a bullet wound to the abdomen.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.914
The other holds a gun,
which she drops

04:49.039 --> 04:50.624
as she backs away
when they enter.

04:52.001 --> 04:53.460
They recognize
the wounded woman

04:53.585 --> 04:55.004
as Lois Duffy.

04:56.088 --> 04:59.008
She speaks
her last words to them:

04:59.133 --> 05:01.760
"I'm like the blue rose."

05:01.885 --> 05:03.470
She smiles,

05:03.595 --> 05:04.930
then dies...

05:06.515 --> 05:08.809
...then disappears
before their eyes.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.521
The other woman
screaming in the corner,

05:12.646 --> 05:14.440
they now notice

05:14.565 --> 05:16.108
is also Lois Duffy.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.609
Hmm.

05:17.735 --> 05:19.820
By the way, Lois Duffy
did not have a twin sister.

05:21.447 --> 05:22.865
Then while awaiting trial

05:22.990 --> 05:25.159
for a murder she swore
she didn't commit,

05:25.284 --> 05:26.785
this Lois hangs herself.

05:28.287 --> 05:29.538
Those two arresting officers

05:29.663 --> 05:32.082
were Gordon Cole
and Phillip Jeffries.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.753
Now,

05:35.878 --> 05:38.172
what's the one question
you should ask me?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.343
What's the significance
of the blue rose?

05:44.178 --> 05:45.095
And the answer?

05:47.056 --> 05:49.558
Hmm.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.353
Blue rose does not
occur in nature.

05:52.478 --> 05:54.063
It's not a natural thing.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.358
The dying woman
was not natural.

05:58.484 --> 05:59.568
Conjured.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.862
What's the word?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.115
A <i>tulpa.</i>

06:08.869 --> 06:09.870
Good.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.208
Coffee time.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.128
Albert, think I've got it.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.506
And Diane's on her way.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.159
Come on in, Diane.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.208
Make yourself at home.

07:10.431 --> 07:11.306
Enjoy some coffee.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.897
Deputy Diane reporting.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.817
Diane, that last night
you saw Cooper...

07:23.110 --> 07:25.112
...did he, by any chance,

07:25.237 --> 07:28.365
mention Major Garland Briggs?

07:29.366 --> 07:30.659
I don't want to talk
about that night.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.619
I understand.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.329
All I want to know

07:34.455 --> 07:37.124
is, did he mention
Major Briggs?

07:41.628 --> 07:42.921
Fuck you, Gordon.

07:44.006 --> 07:44.840
Yes.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.760
Albert.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.390
Diane, as you know,
we've been investigating

07:53.515 --> 07:56.101
an old case of Cooper's
involving Major Briggs.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.438
Briggs died in a fire
at his government facility

07:59.563 --> 08:01.106
25 years ago.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.357
Right.

08:02.483 --> 08:03.942
We thought.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.736
Turns out he died
a few days ago

08:05.861 --> 08:07.529
here in Buckhorn, and...

08:08.322 --> 08:10.491
...we found this
in his stomach.

08:11.408 --> 08:14.077
The ring was inscribed:

08:14.203 --> 08:16.705
"To Dougie, with love,

08:16.830 --> 08:18.332
Janey-E."

08:19.833 --> 08:21.084
Oh, my God.

08:22.377 --> 08:23.504
What is it?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.842
My sister's name is Jane,

08:28.967 --> 08:29.968
my half sister.

08:32.638 --> 08:35.724
She's married to a man
named Douglas Jones.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.354
But everybody calls him Dougie.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.985
And her nickname's Janey-E.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.947
Where do they live?

08:50.072 --> 08:52.950
Last I heard, Las Vegas.

08:53.075 --> 08:55.244
When did you last
speak with her?

08:57.829 --> 08:59.164
We're estranged.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.419
I hate her,

09:04.545 --> 09:06.505
so...

09:06.630 --> 09:08.048
I haven't talked
to her in years.

09:08.966 --> 09:09.800
Tammy,

09:09.925 --> 09:12.094
get the Las Vegas office
on the line.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.849
Las Vegas office, please.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.772
Uh, I have
Director Gordon Cole

09:23.897 --> 09:24.773
on the line for you, sir.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.024
- Gordon Cole?
- Mm.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.194
Director Cole, sir, I--

09:29.319 --> 09:30.529
I want everything

09:30.654 --> 09:33.115
<i>you've got or could find</i>

09:33.240 --> 09:36.493
on a Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Jones
of your fair city.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.495
These people are wanted
in connection

09:38.620 --> 09:40.163
with a double murder

09:40.289 --> 09:41.873
and may be armed
and dangerous.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.334
<i>Put caution
in the shotgun seat.</i>

09:44.459 --> 09:45.919
Douglas Jones.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.130
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- High priority.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.423
<i>Get back to me.</i>

09:49.548 --> 09:51.049
Your man has my info.

09:51.174 --> 09:52.175
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

09:56.763 --> 09:59.433
There's 23 Douglas Joneses
in the greater metro area.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.895
How are we gonna
find the right one?

10:04.021 --> 10:06.648
Wilson, how many
times have I told you...

10:07.733 --> 10:09.776
...this is what we do in the FBI?

10:11.361 --> 10:12.571
Thank you, Diane.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.074
Yeah.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.288
Okay.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.925
Before I came up,

10:34.051 --> 10:36.637
I was on the phone
with Sheriff Truman

10:36.762 --> 10:38.055
in Twin Peaks.

10:39.306 --> 10:42.434
He told me
they are onto something

10:42.559 --> 10:45.228
from Laura Palmer's diary

10:45.354 --> 10:48.190
indicating two Coopers.

10:52.903 --> 10:57.407
And last night, I had
another Monica Bellucci dream.

10:57.532 --> 10:58.700
Oh, boy.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.295
I was in Paris on a case.

11:11.672 --> 11:13.715
Monica called

11:13.840 --> 11:16.968
and asked me to meet her
at a certain cafe.

11:19.805 --> 11:22.265
<i>She said she needed
to talk to me.</i>

11:31.191 --> 11:33.944
When we met at the cafe,

11:34.069 --> 11:35.529
Cooper was there.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.282
<i>But I couldn't see his face.</i>

11:43.704 --> 11:46.456
Monica was very pleasant.

11:46.581 --> 11:49.126
<i>She had brought friends.</i>

11:52.212 --> 11:54.172
We all had a coffee.

12:12.816 --> 12:16.945
And then she said
the ancient phrase...

12:17.070 --> 12:20.198
We're like the dreamer,

12:20.323 --> 12:24.077
who dreams
and then lives inside the dream.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.788
<i>..."We are like
the dreamer,</i>

12:26.913 --> 12:28.623
who dreams

12:28.749 --> 12:31.418
and then lives
inside the dream."

12:32.419 --> 12:34.880
I told her I understood.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.466
And then she said...

12:40.510 --> 12:44.139
But who is the dreamer?

12:49.144 --> 12:51.104
..."But who is the dreamer?"

12:56.026 --> 12:59.821
A very powerful uneasy feeling
came over me.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.825
<i>Monica looked past me</i>

13:03.950 --> 13:06.495
and indicated to me
to look back

13:06.620 --> 13:08.413
at something
that was happening there.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.833
<i>I turned and looked.</i>

13:15.337 --> 13:17.839
<i>I saw myself.</i>

13:17.964 --> 13:21.426
I saw myself from long ago,

13:21.551 --> 13:24.304
in the old Philadelphia offices...

13:26.348 --> 13:28.141
...listening to Cooper

13:28.266 --> 13:31.102
telling me he was worried
about a dream he had.

13:31.228 --> 13:33.814
Gordon, it's 10:10 a.m.

13:33.939 --> 13:36.107
on February 16th.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.445
I was worried about today

13:40.570 --> 13:42.447
because of the dream
I told you about.

13:44.032 --> 13:46.618
And that was the day
Phillip Jeffries appeared...

13:46.743 --> 13:48.203
Gordon!

13:48.328 --> 13:49.788
<i>...and didn't appear.</i>

13:49.913 --> 13:52.207
Phillip?
Is that you?

13:53.583 --> 13:54.584
Phillip?

13:55.669 --> 13:56.920
Cooper,

13:57.045 --> 13:59.130
meet the long-lost
Phillip Jeffries.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.716
You may have heard of him
from the academy.

14:01.842 --> 14:04.386
And while Jeffries
was apparently there,

14:04.511 --> 14:06.513
he raised his arm

14:06.638 --> 14:09.307
and pointed at Cooper
and asked me...

14:09.432 --> 14:11.977
Who do you think
that is there?

14:13.436 --> 14:14.729
Damn!

14:14.855 --> 14:16.898
I hadn't remembered that.

14:17.023 --> 14:20.318
Now, this is really something
interesting to think about.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.529
Yes.

14:24.739 --> 14:27.075
I'm beginning
to remember that too.

14:45.302 --> 14:47.137
Hey.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.889
All right.

14:49.014 --> 14:50.640
Turkey and cheese.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.475
Ham and cheese.

14:52.601 --> 14:53.977
Roast beef and cheese.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.021
And just cheese.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.482
Who ordered just cheese?

14:59.608 --> 15:00.650
I did.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.444
It's all old business, Chad,

15:02.569 --> 15:04.404
from long before
your time.

15:05.822 --> 15:06.948
Where you guys going?

15:07.073 --> 15:08.700
Up the mountain.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.077
And you are
under arrest, Chad.

15:11.202 --> 15:12.662
What the fuck?

15:12.787 --> 15:14.080
What's this all about?

15:14.205 --> 15:16.291
I think you know.

15:17.542 --> 15:18.960
Andy, Bobby,

15:19.085 --> 15:20.670
take him downstairs.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.715
You're making a big mistake!

15:23.840 --> 15:25.300
You made the mistake, Chad.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.218
We've been watching you
for months.

15:27.344 --> 15:29.512
Take his badge, too,
and lock him up.

15:29.638 --> 15:30.972
You're making a big mistake.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.599
Shut up.

15:40.941 --> 15:43.193
There's your roast beef
and cheese.

16:59.602 --> 17:00.645
Bobby.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.438
This used to be
the road, where we're walking.

18:25.563 --> 18:28.108
My dad's listening post station
was right through there.

18:28.233 --> 18:29.651
Nothing left of it now.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.027
Took everything away.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.990
And what all did your father
do up there, Bobby?

18:36.116 --> 18:37.117
I don't know.

18:37.242 --> 18:39.202
It was all top secret.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.329
Took me inside a couple times
when I was little,

18:41.454 --> 18:44.165
but all I remember is

18:44.290 --> 18:46.209
lots and lots
of machines.

18:47.502 --> 18:49.087
He would take me here,
though.

19:02.976 --> 19:03.977
Just a sec.

19:14.779 --> 19:15.697
This is it,

19:15.822 --> 19:17.323
Jack Rabbit's Palace.

19:33.882 --> 19:36.092
You know, we'd sit here
and‒and...

19:36.217 --> 19:38.595
make up great tall tales.

19:41.890 --> 19:44.851
Two hundred and fifty-three yards
due east.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.771
And we have to put
some soil in our pockets.

19:54.319 --> 19:55.987
Let's hope this is not one

19:56.112 --> 19:58.281
of your father's tall tales.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.742
I hope so too.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.410
I don't think so.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.078
We'll soon find out.

20:05.496 --> 20:06.414
Father did tell me

20:06.539 --> 20:08.249
never wander around here
without him.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.466
Let's go.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.310
She's alive.

23:20.691 --> 23:22.443
It's 2:53, fellas.

27:17.053 --> 27:18.137
Got a light?

30:10.851 --> 30:12.895
We need to get her
down the mountain.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.104
She's very important,

30:14.230 --> 30:15.648
and there are people
that want her dead.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.485
She's fine physically.

30:19.610 --> 30:22.321
We need to put her in a cell
where she'll be safe.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.699
Okay.

30:25.825 --> 30:27.368
Don't tell anybody about this.

30:43.843 --> 30:45.803
What happened to us
back there?

30:46.846 --> 30:48.305
I don't know.

30:48.430 --> 30:49.431
Something.

30:50.266 --> 30:52.393
But I don't remember a thing.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.229
Same with me.

31:03.529 --> 31:06.991
I hope these pajamas
are okay.

31:07.116 --> 31:08.576
They've been in my locker

31:08.701 --> 31:12.663
since the time that dog
got lost in here.

31:13.330 --> 31:15.624
They're beautiful, Lucy.

31:15.749 --> 31:18.669
Do you remember
that night, Andy?

31:19.962 --> 31:21.380
Yes, I do.

31:28.637 --> 31:30.055
Idiots.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.891
You're a joke, Andy!

31:32.016 --> 31:33.475
You're no kind of cop!

31:34.435 --> 31:36.645
You're no kind of cop at all!

31:37.438 --> 31:39.857
You're no kind of cop at all.

31:47.364 --> 31:50.618
You're a very bad person, Chad.

31:50.743 --> 31:52.953
Give good policemen a bad name.

31:55.414 --> 31:58.083
Good policemen a bad name.

32:29.156 --> 32:31.367
Shut up, you fucking drunk!

32:31.492 --> 32:33.702
Shut up, you fucking drunk!

33:00.312 --> 33:02.564
God damn it,
I said shut up!

33:02.690 --> 33:03.774
Shut up!

33:06.318 --> 33:07.903
What the fuck is wrong with you?

33:08.028 --> 33:10.614
What the fuck is wrong with you?

33:12.449 --> 33:13.909
Fucking nuthouse.

33:14.034 --> 33:16.078
Fucking nuthouse.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.306
I better do that.

34:28.317 --> 34:29.818
What'd you want me to do
with the crates?

34:29.943 --> 34:31.111
Just leave them.

34:31.236 --> 34:32.946
I'll throw the linens on them
in the morning.

34:33.072 --> 34:34.323
It's easier for them that way.

34:34.448 --> 34:35.282
There you go.

34:37.367 --> 34:38.410
Take it easy.

34:39.328 --> 34:41.080
We're cool.

34:41.205 --> 34:42.372
Okay, Jimmy.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.170
We got one more delivery,

34:48.295 --> 34:50.547
and then it's
hit the Roadhouse.

34:51.507 --> 34:52.716
Who's playing?

34:53.801 --> 34:54.760
Don't know.

34:56.303 --> 34:58.263
You want to see
if Renee will be there.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.559
Yeah, maybe.

35:02.684 --> 35:04.686
But she's married.

35:06.105 --> 35:06.939
I know.

35:10.192 --> 35:11.401
How old are you,
Freddie?

35:12.277 --> 35:14.029
Going on 23.

35:15.364 --> 35:17.407
I remember being 23.

35:21.745 --> 35:23.580
It's my birthday today.

35:23.705 --> 35:25.082
Is that right?

35:26.125 --> 35:27.584
Well, happy birthday, Jimmy.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.295
This is a real occasion.

35:38.679 --> 35:41.682
So you really can't
take that thing off, huh?

35:41.807 --> 35:42.975
Nah, I can't.

35:45.686 --> 35:47.020
I don't understand.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.481
It's, uh,

35:49.606 --> 35:50.649
part of me.

35:51.859 --> 35:54.194
Doctor tried
to take it off once, and...

35:55.154 --> 35:56.488
...I started bleeding.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.326
Where'd you get it?

36:02.494 --> 36:05.455
I'm, uh,
not supposed to tell.

36:05.581 --> 36:08.625
It's my birthday, Freddie.
You gotta tell me.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.919
Come on, I'm not
gonna tell anybody.

36:11.044 --> 36:13.088
Eh, you ain't
gonna believe me anyway.

36:13.213 --> 36:14.840
So you may as well tell me.

36:14.965 --> 36:17.718
Freddie, come on,
tell me the story.

36:19.303 --> 36:20.512
Come on.

36:21.555 --> 36:22.681
Well...

36:24.558 --> 36:26.768
I told the doctor.

36:26.894 --> 36:29.354
I, uh‒I guess
I can tell you.

36:30.439 --> 36:32.774
And seeing as
how it's your birthday.

36:38.989 --> 36:41.033
I was still living
at home, see?

36:41.158 --> 36:42.242
Where was that?

36:42.367 --> 36:45.037
That would be London Town,
East End.

36:46.038 --> 36:49.082
About six months ago,

36:49.208 --> 36:52.878
after a night down at the pub
with me mates,

36:53.003 --> 36:54.504
I'm walking home alone.

36:56.423 --> 36:58.926
I get this peculiar feeling
as I turn into this alley

36:59.051 --> 37:00.552
I use as a shortcut.

37:02.763 --> 37:05.390
It strikes me that
I'm wasting me life, Jimmy.

37:06.225 --> 37:07.726
Hanging about,

37:07.851 --> 37:09.728
hitting the pub every night,
drinking...

37:11.271 --> 37:12.898
...when I should be
helping people.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.445
With this feeling in me
on this particular night,

37:18.570 --> 37:22.532
I see in the alleyway
a high stack of boxes,

37:22.658 --> 37:24.243
and I jumped,

37:24.368 --> 37:26.745
you know, like, for fun.

37:28.121 --> 37:30.415
I jumped onto this
high stack of boxes.

37:32.209 --> 37:35.003
And all of a sudden,

37:35.128 --> 37:37.339
I was sucked up
into the vortex

37:37.464 --> 37:39.925
of this massive tunnel
in the air.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.970
Next thing you know,

37:43.095 --> 37:46.223
I'm floating in thin air,

37:46.348 --> 37:48.308
way up somewhere,

37:48.433 --> 37:49.601
like a void.

37:51.895 --> 37:53.855
And this bloke's there.

37:53.981 --> 37:56.525
The Fireman's what
he's called himself.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.070
And he says to me...

38:01.947 --> 38:04.616
..."Go to the hardware store
near your flat.

38:04.741 --> 38:06.201
And there you will find

38:06.326 --> 38:08.412
a rack of green
rubber gardening gloves.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.665
One package will
already be open,

38:11.790 --> 38:13.959
with only a right-handed glove inside.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.545
Purchase that package

38:16.670 --> 38:18.505
and place the glove
on your right hand.

38:19.965 --> 38:22.301
Your right hand will then
possess the power

38:22.426 --> 38:24.928
of an enormous pile driver."

38:25.053 --> 38:25.887
Poof.

38:26.013 --> 38:27.764
And I'm back in me room,

38:27.889 --> 38:29.182
waking up the next morning.

38:30.017 --> 38:31.685
I got up,
got out of bed.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.353
Dragged a comb across me head.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.105
And I went downstairs
and had a cup.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.565
No.

38:36.690 --> 38:37.899
Just kidding about that part.

38:39.776 --> 38:42.237
So I pop round the corner
to the hardware store,

38:42.362 --> 38:43.780
find the rack of gloves.

38:43.905 --> 38:46.616
And, sure enough,

38:46.742 --> 38:47.993
there's the open package

38:48.118 --> 38:49.536
with the one right hand.

38:51.288 --> 38:53.040
Off I go to the counter,

38:53.165 --> 38:54.541
lay down the package
for the clerk,

38:54.666 --> 38:55.917
and he says,

38:56.043 --> 38:57.627
"I can't sell you that one.

38:57.753 --> 38:59.546
You have to buy one
that hasn't been opened."

39:00.505 --> 39:02.841
So I say, "That's all right.
I want this one."

39:03.759 --> 39:05.677
He says,
"I can't sell you that one."

39:07.346 --> 39:09.181
I says, "Listen, mate.

39:09.306 --> 39:11.975
I want to buy
just the one glove,

39:12.100 --> 39:14.519
and I will pay you full price."

39:15.520 --> 39:17.689
"No, it's already been opened.

39:17.814 --> 39:19.274
I can't sell it to ya."

39:20.776 --> 39:23.070
Now, where I come from,

39:23.195 --> 39:25.614
we call a bloke like this

39:25.739 --> 39:27.032
a "jobsworth."

39:28.367 --> 39:30.327
That is a person
who delights in acting

39:30.452 --> 39:33.288
in an obstructive
or otherwise unhelpful manner,

39:33.413 --> 39:35.540
as in, "I can't do that.

39:35.665 --> 39:37.209
It's more than my job's worth."

39:39.044 --> 39:40.587
So I says to Mr. Jobsworth,

39:40.712 --> 39:43.215
"Listen, I'm buying this glove."

39:44.174 --> 39:45.342
And I put me bees
on the counter

39:45.467 --> 39:47.219
and walk towards the door.

39:47.344 --> 39:50.472
Well, Jobsworth leaps after me
like a possessed puma,

39:50.597 --> 39:52.849
screaming that I can't have
the glove from the package

39:52.974 --> 39:54.226
which has already been opened.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.813
I bolt out the door,
hit the cobbles,

39:57.938 --> 40:00.273
hoping to leave Mr. Jobsworth
in the dust,

40:00.399 --> 40:02.025
slipping the glove on
while I go.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.612
Then he slows me down a mite.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.864
And before you know it,
Jobsworth puts a tackle on me

40:07.989 --> 40:09.116
worthy of a red card

40:09.241 --> 40:10.784
and sends me skidding
on the field.

40:11.660 --> 40:13.787
On instinct,
to defend myself,

40:13.912 --> 40:16.748
I popped Jobsworth one
in the loaf with me green glove.

40:18.583 --> 40:21.253
I hear a crack, and...

40:21.378 --> 40:23.964
by the way his head's tilting
and him trying to talk...

40:25.424 --> 40:27.259
...I fear I've
snapped his Gregory.

40:29.761 --> 40:32.222
And then,

40:32.347 --> 40:34.975
in that moment,

40:35.100 --> 40:37.436
I remember something else
that bloke up in the sky told me.

40:39.771 --> 40:42.149
"Once you've got the glove on,

40:42.274 --> 40:45.735
go to Twin Peaks, Washington,

40:45.861 --> 40:48.113
United States of America.

40:48.905 --> 40:50.323
And there,

40:50.449 --> 40:52.159
you will find your destiny."

40:55.454 --> 40:57.664
So here I am, Jimmy,

40:57.789 --> 40:58.915
on your birthday.

40:59.875 --> 41:01.460
Many happy returns.

41:03.962 --> 41:04.796
Wow.

41:06.923 --> 41:09.009
Thank you, Freddie.
That's a great story.

41:09.134 --> 41:10.927
The pleasure's all mine, sir.

41:14.431 --> 41:16.183
Why you?

41:16.308 --> 41:19.144
I mean, why do you think
the Fireman picked you?

41:20.562 --> 41:22.022
Well, that's a good question.

41:22.147 --> 41:25.108
I asked him myself,
I said,

41:25.233 --> 41:26.151
"Why me?"

41:26.860 --> 41:28.236
And he said,

41:28.361 --> 41:29.571
"Why not you?"

41:30.614 --> 41:32.824
And when I went to buy me ticket
to fly over here...

41:34.618 --> 41:36.411
...they told me
I already had a ticket.

41:41.625 --> 41:42.667
Don't forget.

41:42.792 --> 41:44.169
We're supposed
to check the furnace.

41:45.420 --> 41:47.422
Yeah.
You wait for the delivery.

41:47.547 --> 41:48.840
Don't forget
to sign the invoice.

41:48.965 --> 41:50.342
I'm gonna go check
the furnaces.

45:03.159 --> 45:04.035
Bloody Mary.

45:04.160 --> 45:05.078
Coming up.

45:37.652 --> 45:38.737
Thanks.

46:10.435 --> 46:12.270
You drinking all alone tonight?

46:15.106 --> 46:16.941
Mind your own business.

46:18.735 --> 46:19.944
Please.

46:20.069 --> 46:22.489
That's not very polite.

46:28.244 --> 46:30.371
It wasn't meant
to be polite.

46:43.843 --> 46:46.095
Would you sit back

46:46.221 --> 46:48.348
where you were,

46:48.473 --> 46:49.724
please?

46:49.849 --> 46:51.851
I'll sit wherever I want.

46:51.976 --> 46:53.812
It's a free country.

46:53.937 --> 46:56.898
It's a free country.

46:58.191 --> 47:01.903
It's a free cunt-ry.

47:09.619 --> 47:11.830
Maybe you're one of them
bull dykes.

47:13.581 --> 47:14.457
Yeah.

47:15.291 --> 47:16.835
Come to think of it,

47:16.960 --> 47:19.838
you look kind of like
a bull dyke lesbo.

47:24.926 --> 47:28.471
You like to eat cunt, huh?

47:31.099 --> 47:32.851
I'll eat you.

47:32.976 --> 47:34.978
What?

47:35.103 --> 47:38.064
Like hell you will,
you miserable bitch.

47:38.189 --> 47:40.358
I'll fucking pull your little

47:40.483 --> 47:42.402
lesbo titties off.

47:58.209 --> 48:02.005
Do you really
want to fuck with this?

48:20.940 --> 48:22.984
What the hell?
What happened?

48:23.109 --> 48:25.111
He just fell over.
I don't know.

48:26.237 --> 48:28.156
What, with half
his neck missing?

48:29.449 --> 48:30.325
Damn.

48:31.034 --> 48:32.744
You have something
to do with this?

48:32.869 --> 48:34.787
What?
You‒you saw me.

48:34.913 --> 48:37.081
I was just sitting here,
having my drink.

48:39.834 --> 48:41.461
Honey!

48:41.586 --> 48:43.338
Call 911!

48:43.463 --> 48:45.131
We got a dead one at the bar.

48:50.553 --> 48:52.013
We'll see about this.

48:53.431 --> 48:54.599
Yeah.

48:55.642 --> 48:57.602
Sure is a mystery, huh?

49:21.292 --> 49:23.836
That's because you're
hanging out at the nuthouse.

49:23.962 --> 49:25.254
I'm not.

49:26.798 --> 49:28.257
Getting high in there.

49:28.383 --> 49:29.550
Bullshit.
I'm not.

49:29.676 --> 49:31.552
I'm getting high
in my room.

49:31.678 --> 49:33.304
Flying in my own room.

49:34.639 --> 49:36.349
Just don't go in
that nut place.

49:36.474 --> 49:38.184
Fuck you.
Who said I would anyway?

49:46.693 --> 49:47.610
Nice sweater.

49:48.361 --> 49:49.779
Where'd you lift that?

49:52.365 --> 49:54.534
It's Paula's.

50:02.792 --> 50:03.793
It's nice.

50:09.674 --> 50:11.634
Have you seen Billy?

50:14.053 --> 50:15.638
No, not for a couple of days.

50:18.391 --> 50:20.685
I heard you were
the last person to see Billy.

50:24.605 --> 50:26.024
It was so fucking scary.

50:26.899 --> 50:28.735
He was in the kitchen
with me and my mom.

50:29.944 --> 50:31.487
Think my uncle was there.

50:31.612 --> 50:33.364
I'm not sure, um...

50:34.657 --> 50:37.326
You know, at the window,
we see Billy.

50:37.452 --> 50:40.371
He's jumped over a fence,
a six-foot fence,

50:40.496 --> 50:41.998
lands in our backyard.

50:42.123 --> 50:44.792
He comes running like crazy
to the back door.

50:44.917 --> 50:46.711
And I can tell
he sees me through the window.

50:46.836 --> 50:48.588
And he had this look
in his eyes.

50:48.713 --> 50:50.339
Comes slamming in the back,

50:50.465 --> 50:51.966
stumbles in the kitchen.

50:52.091 --> 50:54.927
I start screaming,
and I think my mom screamed too.

50:55.595 --> 50:58.389
And there was blood coming
out his nose and mouth.

50:59.057 --> 51:01.726
And he goes and hangs
his head in the sink.

51:01.851 --> 51:04.645
Blood's just gushing
like a waterfall.

51:04.771 --> 51:07.356
And he turns
and looks at us,

51:07.482 --> 51:09.984
real strange and all bloody.

51:10.109 --> 51:11.986
And then he bolts
out the back again.

51:12.695 --> 51:14.363
We're like, "What?"

51:15.073 --> 51:17.033
And you didn't tell anyone?

51:17.158 --> 51:19.285
We‒we just
didn't know what to do.

51:19.410 --> 51:22.413
I mean, we didn't know
what the hell was going on with him.

51:25.416 --> 51:27.794
And I know my mom and him
had a thing.

51:27.919 --> 51:29.087
What? Really?

51:29.212 --> 51:30.254
Yeah.

51:30.379 --> 51:32.173
Up until pretty recent, at least.

51:32.965 --> 51:35.843
I mean, I just caught wind of it
from time to time.

51:36.552 --> 51:39.013
The smile in her face
whenever his name came up.

51:40.723 --> 51:41.599
Hmm.

51:44.560 --> 51:46.187
What's your mom's name?

51:49.148 --> 51:50.233
It's Tina.

52:00.034 --> 52:01.828
Then he just ran out again?

52:03.538 --> 52:05.164
Yeah, just, like,

52:05.289 --> 52:08.126
he was in our kitchen
for maybe, like, ten seconds,

52:08.251 --> 52:10.962
and then he just took off,
real fast and crazy.

52:11.838 --> 52:14.715
And after, we see
all the blood on the floor

52:14.841 --> 52:16.092
and some on the wall.

52:16.801 --> 52:18.594
Took a while to clean it up,

52:18.719 --> 52:19.971
me and my mom.

52:21.889 --> 52:24.142
I don't remember
if my uncle was there.
