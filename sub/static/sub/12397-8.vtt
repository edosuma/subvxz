YOU...

00:05.730 --> 00:08.233

00:15.410 --> 00:16.877
THAT'S RIGHT,

00:16.910 --> 00:18.673
YOU GOT BOLOGNA

00:18.710 --> 00:20.541
YOU GOT LUNCH MEAT.

00:20.580 --> 00:22.286
RIGHT ON YOUR FACE, KID!

00:22.320 --> 00:24.880
- DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:24.920 --> 00:26.217
- YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT I'M DOING.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.012
- ACTUALLY, I DON'T.

00:28.060 --> 00:29.755
- TODAY IS THE FIRST FRIDAY
IN THE MONTH OF MARCH.

00:29.790 --> 00:30.825
- OKAY.

00:30.860 --> 00:31.986
- THE DAY...

00:32.030 --> 00:33.327
THAT PROFESSOR BOB STEIN,

00:33.360 --> 00:35.521
PARANORMAL FORENSIC EXPERT

00:35.560 --> 00:37.027

CUTTING EDGE CONSULTANTS
CONVENTION.

SUPERNATURAL POLICE CONSULTANTS
FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

00:49.350 --> 00:50.977
AND ALL RECEIVE MAJOR BOOSTS

00:51.010 --> 00:52.944

IN THE PROCESS.

00:52.980 --> 00:56.780
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
THE LAST THREE YEARS, MAN?

00:56.820 --> 00:58.117
[grunts]

00:58.150 --> 01:00.789
TAKE IT, STEIN.

01:00.820 --> 01:02.856
- SHAWN, I JUST MET
THE WOMAN OF MY DREAMS.

01:02.890 --> 01:04.551
SHE WORKS AT JOHNNY ROCKETS.

01:04.590 --> 01:06.023
- [grunts]

01:06.060 --> 01:09.621
PIMENTO...
IN YOUR MOUTH.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.592
- DUDE, I JUST MET
MY FUTURE BRIDE.

01:11.630 --> 01:15.134
SHE'S WORKING AT A DRIVE-THROUGH
AT WIENERSCHNITZEL.

01:15.170 --> 01:18.435
- NOW THIS
IS WHAT'S UP, STEIN.

01:18.470 --> 01:19.801
WHAT'S UP?

01:19.840 --> 01:21.171
- SHAWN, GUESS WHO I MET

01:21.210 --> 01:25.146
WALKING INTO
THE GASTROENTEROLOGIST.

01:25.180 --> 01:26.841
- ALL CAUGHT UP

01:26.880 --> 01:28.245
IN WHATEVER GIRL
YOU WERE CHASING AROUND

01:28.280 --> 01:29.349
AND CREEPING OUT.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.948
- BUT I'M HERE FOR YOU NOW.

01:30.990 --> 01:32.685
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

01:32.720 --> 01:34.381
IT DOESN'T FRICKING MATTER, GUS.
YOU KNOW WHY?

01:34.420 --> 01:36.183
'CAUSE SHAWN SPENCER--
THAT'S ME--

01:36.230 --> 01:38.425
DOESN'T NEED
PROFESSOR BOB STEIN

01:38.460 --> 01:40.223
OR HIS CONVENTION OF FRAUDS!

01:40.260 --> 01:41.796
- TECHNICALLY, YOU'RE A FRAUD.

01:41.830 --> 01:42.990
- IF HE WANTS TO TURN
A BLIND EYE

01:43.030 --> 01:44.224
TO MY SKILL SET
FOR FOUR YEARS RUNNING,

01:44.270 --> 01:45.225
THEN HE CAN EAT
A HOT STEAMING BOWL

01:45.270 --> 01:46.464
OF SUCK-IT SOUP!

01:46.500 --> 01:48.161
YOU KNOW WHY?

01:48.200 --> 01:49.701
BECAUSE GUESS WHAT I MAKE
FROM SCRATCH EVERY MORNING,

01:49.740 --> 01:52.800
USING ONLY THE FRESHEST
MOST ORGANIC INGREDIENTS

01:52.840 --> 01:54.876
LOCAL FARMS.

01:54.910 --> 01:56.241
- SUCK-IT SOUP?

01:56.280 --> 01:57.804
- [whispering]
THAT'S RIGHT, SON.

01:57.850 --> 01:58.874
- SHAWN, THIS IS NOT
A REJECT ION LE'ITER.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.047
IT'S AN INVITATION.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.069
- WHAT?

02:01.120 --> 02:02.189
GIVE ME THAT.

02:02.220 --> 02:04.017
THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU.

02:04.050 --> 02:07.213
[mumbles]

02:07.260 --> 02:08.659
OH, MY GOD, GUS!

02:08.690 --> 02:10.157
I DID IT!

02:10.190 --> 02:11.851
I MADE IT!

02:11.890 --> 02:12.891
- CALM DOWN.

02:12.930 --> 02:14.192
- I DID IT!

02:14.230 --> 02:18.326
- WELL, DETECTIVE BRANNIGAN.

02:18.370 --> 02:20.497
I CAN CERTAINLY SEE

02:20.540 --> 02:22.337
WHY THE MAYOR INSISTED
ON ME HIRING YOU

02:22.370 --> 02:24.008
AS OUR NEW HEAD DETECTIVE.

02:24.040 --> 02:28.636
- [whistling]

02:30.950 --> 02:33.111
- OKAY.

02:33.150 --> 02:34.640
I WOULD BE LYING IF I SAID

02:34.680 --> 02:35.612
I WASN'T IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR FILE.

02:35.650 --> 02:37.311
IT'S IMPECCABLE.

02:37.350 --> 02:39.079
ONE OF THE FINEST
PRESS RECORDS I'VE EVER SEEN.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.213
- OH, YOU'RE TOO KIND.

02:41.260 --> 02:44.081
- LOOK, UM,
FULL DISCLOSURE.

02:44.130 --> 02:45.324
YOU WERE NOT MY FIRST CHOICE

02:45.360 --> 02:47.123
FOR THE POSITION
OF HEAD DETECTIVE.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.094
MY FORMER PARTNER
JULIET O'HARA WAS--

02:49.130 --> 02:50.222
- YEAH, I GOT THE LOWDOWN.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.794
AMAZING DETECTIVE.

02:51.830 --> 02:53.331
INTIMIDATING.

02:53.370 --> 02:55.668
GRAY PANTSUITS,
THE WHOLE NINE YARDS.

02:55.700 --> 02:58.828
VERY BIG HEELS TO FILL.

02:58.870 --> 03:00.929
- I'M SORRY, ARE YOU
DOING CRAFTS ON MY TABLE?

03:00.980 --> 03:02.777
- CRAl-TING, TECHNICALLY.

03:02.810 --> 03:06.519
I AM JUST AN EMPTY VESSEL
FOR THE UNIVERSE TO FILL

03:06.550 --> 03:08.871
WITH WHATEVER CREATIVE IMPULSE

03:08.920 --> 03:11.138
IT FEELS LIKE EXPRESSING
THAT DAY.

03:11.190 --> 03:12.680
YOU LIKE APPLE BU'ITER?

03:12.720 --> 03:14.153
- I DO NOT.

03:14.190 --> 03:16.784
- 'KAY, NOW LISTEN HERE.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.855
I WORK SUPER-DUPER HARD.

03:18.890 --> 03:20.255
AND I ALWAYS GO BY THE BOOK.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.858
I AM A TEAM PLAYER.

03:21.900 --> 03:25.028
AND I ALWAYS PACK MY OWN LUNCH.

03:25.070 --> 03:27.197
I MADE THIS FOR YOU

03:27.240 --> 03:30.403
AS A GESTURE
OF PLATONIC KINDNESS.

03:33.740 --> 03:35.173
- [sighs]
DID YOU SEE THAT?

03:35.210 --> 03:36.199
- SEE WHAT?
- HA-HA!

03:36.250 --> 03:37.979
I HAVE FINALLY ARRIVED, GUS!

03:38.010 --> 03:39.238
LOOK AT MY FANS.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.168
THEY'RE SO SWEET
AND RESPECT FUL.

03:41.220 --> 03:42.744
- I'M PRETTY SURE
THEY'RE JUST STUDENTS, SHAWN.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.280
- IT'S OKAY, GUYS.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.118
I PUT THESE BOXER BRIEFS ON
ONE LEG AT A TIME.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.220
- SHAWN, SHAWN SPENCER.
HELLO, I--

03:50.260 --> 03:52.922
- PLEASE, NO PICS OR AUTOGRAPHS
UNTIL I GO THROUGH THE WORKS.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.791
THAT'S SLANG
FOR HAIR AND MAKEUP.

03:54.830 --> 03:57.025
SPANX.
JUST A TOUCH OF BEE POLLEN.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.594
- [laughing]
NO, I'M RANDALL FISHBECK.

03:58.630 --> 04:00.166
ASSISTANT TO PROFESSOR STEIN.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.758

04:01.800 --> 04:03.802
UP HIGH, FISH!

04:03.840 --> 04:05.569
- PLEASE DON'T PLAY
WITH MY NAME.

04:05.610 --> 04:06.907
- NO CAN DO.

04:06.940 --> 04:09.704
TIP-TOP ON THE CROWD CONTROL,
FISHMAN.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.342
I FEEL GOOD.
I FEEL SAFE AND SECURE.

04:11.380 --> 04:12.870
- IS THERE A GREENROOM, RANDALL?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.945
IF SO, I DRINK
ONLY VITAMIN WATER.

04:14.980 --> 04:16.413
NOT THE SPORTS DRINK,

04:16.450 --> 04:17.940
JUST REGULAR EVIAN
WITH CRUSHED VITAMINS.

04:17.990 --> 04:19.355
FLINTSTONES CHEWABLES.
ALL BARNEYS.

04:19.390 --> 04:21.278
- COME ON, MAN!

04:21.320 --> 04:24.050
ALL I WANTED WAS A MINUTE
WITH PROFESSOR STEIN, ALL RIGHT?

04:24.090 --> 04:25.352
I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN DB'D, MAN!

04:25.390 --> 04:28.689
I WAS WRONGFULLY DB'D!

04:28.730 --> 04:30.197
- HEY, FISHFRY,
WHO'S THE CRAZY GUY?

04:30.230 --> 04:32.369
- THAT'S JAMES EARL CRAIG.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.560
- THAT'S THE VOICE
OF DARTH VADER?

04:33.600 --> 04:35.431
- THAT'S JAMES EARL JONES.

04:35.470 --> 04:36.505
- [assumes British accent]
MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.

04:36.540 --> 04:38.007
- THAT'S SIR ALEC GUINNESS.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.577
- HUH.
I GO'ITA SEE THAT FLICK ATAIN.

04:40.610 --> 04:44.205
- WELL, IT IS JUST REALLY SAD,
ACTUALLY.

04:44.250 --> 04:46.946
JAMES EARL WAS LAPD'S
MIND-READER CONSULTANT.

04:46.980 --> 04:48.709
HE HELPED SOLVE MANY CASES

04:48.750 --> 04:50.388
AND WAS ON OUR PANEL
FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.786
- WHAT HAPPENED?

04:52.820 --> 04:56.153
- WELL, PROFESSOR STEIN
SAW SOME RED FLAGS

04:56.190 --> 04:57.953
AND DISCOVERED
THAT HE WAS A FRAUD.

04:57.990 --> 05:00.094
HE OUTED JAMES EARL
AT LAST YEAR'S CONVENTION.

05:00.130 --> 05:01.119
IT WAS UGLY.

05:01.160 --> 05:02.422
RUINED HIS CAREER.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.495
SUBSEQUENTLY,
LAPD CUT HIM LOOSE

05:04.530 --> 05:05.565
AND HE FELL TO PIECES.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.965
- FISHTANK, LET ME SAY THIS.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.467
IF I HAD ONE WISH IN THE WORLD,

05:08.500 --> 05:09.535
IT WOULD BE THAT FRAUDS GET
WHAT THEY DESERVE

05:09.570 --> 05:11.299
AND NOT GO TO HEAVEN.

05:11.340 --> 05:12.807
THAT AND THAT THEY'RE SENTENCED
TO FLY AROUND

05:12.840 --> 05:15.172
IN THOSE MIRRORS
FROM SUPERMAN II.

05:15.210 --> 05:17.804
- SHAWN--
- FRAUDS...THOSE DICKS.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.875
- STOP WISHING.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.911
- OKAY.
[sighs]

05:21.950 --> 05:25.784
- WHAAAAAT'S UP?
- COME ON, SON.

05:25.820 --> 05:28.288
- GENTLEMEN, ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE

05:28.320 --> 05:29.389
THE DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR--

05:29.430 --> 05:32.126

05:32.160 --> 05:33.696
I'M HERE!

05:33.730 --> 05:35.425
LET THE SHAWN SPENCER ERA
BEGIN.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.428
- I'M SORRY,
I DON'T SHAKE HANDS.

05:37.470 --> 05:40.268
- AFRAID YOU'LL BE PENETRATED
BY MY MAGICAL PSYCHIC POWERS?

05:40.300 --> 05:42.962
- THAT, AND YOUR HANDS
ARE A CESSPOOL OF GERMS.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.535
- MM. THEN PERHAPS WE SHOULD
HIP-BUMP.

05:45.570 --> 05:48.004
- MR. SPENCER, PLEASE SAY HELLO
TO YOUR OTHER PANELISTS.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.873
- OH.

05:50.910 --> 05:53.879
NEW ORLEANS PD'S GIl-TED
WICCA CONSULTANT.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.945
- WITCH.
I LIKE THAT VERY MUCH.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.845
AND THE FANNY PACK
IS A NICE TOUCH.

05:57.890 --> 05:59.289
- THIS IS A CINGULUM,

05:59.320 --> 06:02.016
WHICH HOUSES MY INCENSE,
BOLINE, AND PENTACLE.

06:02.060 --> 06:04.255
AMATEUR.

06:04.290 --> 06:05.780
- HAZEL, LET ME JUST SAY
THAT I THINK

06:05.830 --> 06:08.549
YOUR MAGICAL SACRED-CIRCLE RING
IS LOVELY.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.568
- THIS IS A WEDDING RING, FOOL.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.465
ANCHORAGE PD'S GHOST WHISPERER.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.263
AND OF COURSE, BERNIE.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.063
- BERNIE?

06:18.110 --> 06:19.907
- BERNIE IS
MY MOST TRUSTED ENTITY.

06:19.940 --> 06:22.477
AND OVER THE YEARS HE'S BECOME
MY CLOSEST FRIEND.

06:22.510 --> 06:23.738
CUT IT OUT, BERNIE.

06:23.780 --> 06:25.247
I'M SERIOUS.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.440
- THERE'S A GHOST
ON THE PANEL? REALLY?

06:26.480 --> 06:28.345
- REALLY.

06:28.380 --> 06:31.247
BERNIE AND I HAVE ASSISTED
ON 247 CASES SINCE '94.

06:31.290 --> 06:32.450
- WOW.

06:32.490 --> 06:34.310
- PROFESSOR STEIN, IT'S TIME.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.884
- AH. THANKS, GUPPY.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.353
- WHOA. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

06:37.390 --> 06:39.950
- WE'VE BEEN CALLING HIM
RANDALL.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.319
- GOOD OLD RANDALL,
HE'S BEEN WITH ME

06:41.360 --> 06:42.349
SINCE HE WAS A LITTLE FISH.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.267

06:45.300 --> 06:46.938
I WILL GO OUT

06:46.970 --> 06:49.029
AND THEN I'LL BRING YOU OUT
ONE BY ONE.

06:49.070 --> 06:51.300
SHALL WE?

06:51.340 --> 06:55.299
[crowd chattering]

06:55.340 --> 06:57.376
- OH, YEAH.

06:57.410 --> 07:00.243
OH, YEAH.
[cheers and applause]

07:00.280 --> 07:02.316
- LADIES AND GENTS,
WELCOME TO

07:02.350 --> 07:06.218
THE 2014 CUTTING EDGE
CONSULTANTS CONVENTION.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.389
WE HAVE AN AMAZING PANEL
OF THE COUNTRY'S TOP...

07:08.420 --> 07:09.489
- [whispering]
IT'S TAKEN SO LONG.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.725
IT FEELS SO FRICKING SWEET.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.227
- YEAH, SWEET IT IS,
BUT I THINK

07:13.260 --> 07:14.454
YOU BE'ITER PATCH THINGS UP
WITH GARTH AND BERNIE.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.024
THEY DO NOT LOOK HAPPY.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.129
- IT DOESN'T MA'ITER, GUS.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.489
- IT DOES MA'ITER.
- OW!

07:18.530 --> 07:20.634
UH, HEY, GARTH.

07:20.670 --> 07:23.138
SO HOW DOES ONE GO ABOUT,
YOU KNOW, TEAMING UP

07:23.170 --> 07:25.035
WITH A GHOST?
- YEAH.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.298
- BERNIE WAS
A FAMOUS BEAR TRAPPER

07:26.340 --> 07:28.001
IN THE KODIAK, IN THE 18305.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.746
- OH.

07:29.780 --> 07:31.441
- HE ALSO HAUNTED MY
AUNT JUNIE'S HOUSE UP IN BETHEL.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.414
- WELL, THAT IS
AN INTERESTING TWIST

07:33.450 --> 07:34.849
ON "MEET CUTE," HUH?

07:34.880 --> 07:36.347
- ENOUGH, FAKER.

07:36.380 --> 07:37.312
- I'M SORRY, I HAVE TO AGREE
WITH HAZEL HERE.

07:37.350 --> 07:39.238
- I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU!

07:39.290 --> 07:41.451
JAMES EARL SHOULD BE HERE
INSTEAD OF YOUR CHARLATAN ASS.

07:41.490 --> 07:44.152
HE IS A GII-TED MIND READER
AND DEAR FRIEND.

07:44.190 --> 07:46.897
STEIN GOT IT WRONG.
YEAH, I SAID IT.

07:46.930 --> 07:48.454
- FROM NEW ORLEANS PD,
HAZEL LAZARUS!

07:48.500 --> 07:51.924

THE DEVIL.

07:51.970 --> 07:54.438

SHAKE IT OFF.

07:54.470 --> 07:57.359

07:57.410 --> 08:01.107
GARTH MATHERS

[cheers and applause]

08:03.110 --> 08:05.499
- GO GET 'EM.
- SUCK IT, BERNIE.

08:05.550 --> 08:07.541
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, MAN,
THIS IS MY TIME.

08:07.580 --> 08:09.411
GUS, THIS IS MY MOMENT.

08:09.450 --> 08:10.610
YOU MAY HAVE TO HANG BACK,
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW

08:10.650 --> 08:12.117
IF THERE'S ROOM
ON THE SOFA FOR YOU.

08:12.150 --> 08:13.686
- THERE'S ROOM
ON THE SOFA FOR ME.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.449
- WE HOPE THERE'S ROOM,
BUT IF THERE'S NOT,

08:15.490 --> 08:17.424
YOU GONNA HAVE TO LAY HORIZONTAL
AT MY FEET, OKAY?

08:17.460 --> 08:19.155
OR GO CRISSCROSS APPLESAUCE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY KNEES.

08:19.190 --> 08:21.499
- THAT SBPD'S
RESIDENT PSYCHIC CONSULTANT

08:21.530 --> 08:24.124
IS IN FACT
THE REAL THING!

08:24.170 --> 08:26.161
- TAKE IT, IT'S YOURS.

08:26.200 --> 08:31.228

[clears throat forcefully]

08:31.270 --> 08:32.908
[groans]

08:32.940 --> 08:34.498
[all screaming]

08:34.540 --> 08:35.507
- LET'S DO THIS.
- PUT IT IN YOUR PIPE

08:35.540 --> 08:37.405
AND SMOKE IT.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.304
[screaming continues]

08:39.350 --> 08:42.319
BOOM! AAH!

08:42.350 --> 08:47.413
LET ME HEAR IT IN THE EAST!

08:47.460 --> 08:50.554
I KNOW YOU CAN DO BETTER
THAN THAT!

08:53.000 --> 08:55.855
DUDE.
- WHAT?

08:55.900 --> 08:57.197
OH.

08:57.230 --> 08:59.221
- SOMEBODY HELP THIS MAN!
- MAN.

08:59.270 --> 09:02.330
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

09:02.370 --> 09:04.565
- * I KNOW YOU KNOW

09:04.610 --> 09:05.759
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

09:05.810 --> 09:08.370
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

09:08.410 --> 09:09.672
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

09:09.710 --> 09:10.699
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

09:10.750 --> 09:12.741
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

09:12.780 --> 09:14.418
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

09:14.450 --> 09:17.442
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

09:17.490 --> 09:20.186
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
- [screaming]

09:24.330 --> 09:25.649
- THERE'S NO SHAME IN CRYING.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.590
COME ON, IT'S OKAY, BERNIE.

09:27.630 --> 09:29.052
LET IT OUT, MAN.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.419
COME ON.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.199
- [sniffling]

09:32.230 --> 09:33.492
- OH, WOULD YOU STOP IT?

09:33.540 --> 09:34.996
YOU HARDLY KNEW STEIN.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.393
- I'M A SYMPATHETIC CRIER,
SHAWN.

09:36.440 --> 09:37.429
- IT'S A FRICKING GHOST, GUS.

09:37.470 --> 09:38.767
YOU CAN'T SEE HIS FACE.

09:38.810 --> 09:40.505
YOU CAN'T SEE HIS TEARS.

09:40.540 --> 09:42.428
- NOW, BRANNIGAN,
I'M NOT SAYING

09:42.480 --> 09:44.300
I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND
THROUGH THIS ENTIRE FIRST CASE.

09:44.350 --> 09:46.648
- HEY, YOU HOLD IT IF IT HELPS.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.978
AND DON'T BE ALARMED
BY THE BALMINESS.

09:49.020 --> 09:51.614
- BERNIE, TAKE A SEAT,
TAKE A SEAT.

09:51.650 --> 09:53.186
LISTEN, YOU GOTTA GET A HOLD
OF YOURSELF, MAN.

09:53.220 --> 09:54.551
YOU CANNOT USE THIS
AS AN EXCUSE

09:54.590 --> 09:56.285
TO FALL OFF THE WAGON AGAIN.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.049
WHAT? WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

09:58.090 --> 09:59.159
WHERE--
- GARTH!

09:59.190 --> 10:00.657
- BERNIE?
- GUYS!

10:00.700 --> 10:02.395
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT PLAYING THIS GAME!

10:02.430 --> 10:03.988
- A VISION IS COMING SOON

10:04.030 --> 10:06.635
TO A CRIME SCENE
NEAR US ALL!

10:06.670 --> 10:07.739
- OH, SWEET HELL IN A HARDCART.

10:07.770 --> 10:10.102
- WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?

10:10.140 --> 10:12.438
- JUST A REGULAR TUESDAY
AT THE SBPD.

10:12.470 --> 10:13.801
- OH, THIS CAN'T BE ACCEPTABLE.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.102
I HAVE TO CORRAL THIS.

10:15.140 --> 10:16.801
- LASSIE!

10:16.850 --> 10:18.602
UHH!
LASSIE!

10:18.650 --> 10:20.971
LASSIE, LASSIE, LASSIE.

10:21.020 --> 10:22.339
I'M VERY UPSET.
- MM-HMM.

10:22.380 --> 10:24.314
- BECAUSE THAT WITCH IS MEAN.

10:24.350 --> 10:26.215
AND THE GHOST CANNOT BE TRUSTED,

10:26.250 --> 10:27.717
BECAUSE HE HAS
A DRINKING PROBLEM,

10:27.760 --> 10:29.387
AND--HELLO.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.251
WHO IS THE GIRL NEXT-DOOR
TO YOUR FACE?

10:31.290 --> 10:32.689
- IT'S OUR NEW HEAD DETECTIVE.

10:32.730 --> 10:35.198
- HI. BETSY BRANNIGAN.

10:35.230 --> 10:37.061
IT IS SUCH AN HONOR
TO MEET BOTH OF YOU.

10:37.100 --> 10:39.364
SHAWN.

10:39.400 --> 10:40.765
BURTON.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.336
- [sighs]
- YOU KNOW MY NAME.

10:42.370 --> 10:43.359
- OUR NAMES.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.002
- OF COURSE I DO.

10:45.040 --> 10:48.601
NOW CAN I PLEASE REMOVE THE--

10:48.640 --> 10:50.403
I KNOW IT SOUNDS SO SILLY
BUT HERE IT GOES--

10:50.450 --> 10:51.439
THE GHOST AND THE WITCH?

10:51.480 --> 10:53.209
- YEAH, LASSIE, SERIOUSLY.

10:53.250 --> 10:55.241
- NO, YOU COME HERE.
I CAN'T COME THERE!

10:55.280 --> 10:56.474
I'M SERIOUS.
THIS TIME, I'M SERIOUS.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.511
- BRANNIGAN, WOULD YOU MIND

10:58.550 --> 11:00.484
KEEPING AN EYE
ON THE CRIME SCENE?

11:00.520 --> 11:01.612
I'M GONNA HAVE A QUICK WORD
WITH THESE TWO GENTLEMEN HERE.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.082
- SURE.
- THANKS.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.051
- UP HERE.

11:04.090 --> 11:06.320
I'M JUST GONNA BE ONE SECOND.

11:06.360 --> 11:07.554
OKAY, SPENCER.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.828
NORMALLY, I WOULD ARREST
THE WITCH,

11:08.860 --> 11:09.861
INSTITUTIONALIZE
THE GUY WITH THE GHOST,

11:09.900 --> 11:11.720
AND NOT HIRE YOU.

11:11.770 --> 11:15.331
- FLA'ITERING. KEEP GOING.
- BRANNIGAN HAS GOT TO GO.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.530
HER PURE CANE SUGARY-SWEET
NONSENSE

11:16.570 --> 11:18.128
IS RO'ITING MY CHOMPERS,

11:18.170 --> 11:19.432
AND I CAN'T TAKE
ONE MORE SECOND OF IT.

11:19.470 --> 11:20.869
- YES, BUT THE MAYOR
MADE YOU HIRE HER.

11:20.910 --> 11:22.468
- YEAH, BUT IF SHE QUITS,

11:22.510 --> 11:24.546
THEN MAYBE I CAN HIRE
O'HARA BACK.

11:24.580 --> 11:25.808
- LASSIE, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TALK TO US LIKE WE'RE FIVE.

11:25.850 --> 11:27.408
- MM-HMM.
- DON'T YOU GET IT?

11:27.450 --> 11:29.338
WE CAN DRIVE HER OUT.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.382
ALL RIGHT, IF ALL OF US,
MYSELF INCLUDED,

11:31.420 --> 11:33.285
EMBRACE THE LUDICROUSNESS
OF THIS CASE,

11:33.320 --> 11:34.787
THEN SHE WILL REALIZE
THAT SHE DOESN'T BELONG HERE.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.287
- THIS IS NOT HELPING!

11:36.320 --> 11:37.787
- MAYBE SHE WILL LEAVE
ON HER OWN.

11:37.830 --> 11:38.751
AND BY EMBRACE, I MEAN
THAT I'M GONNA NEED YOU,

11:38.790 --> 11:40.621
AND TO SOME DEGREE YOU,

11:40.660 --> 11:42.525
TO GO FROM YOUR EVERYDAY
DRIVE-ME-NUTS LEVEL 10

11:42.560 --> 11:46.121
ANTICS OF STUPIDITY
AND KICK IT UP TO AN 11.

11:46.170 --> 11:49.936
- [gaSPSJ
- [whispering] 11.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.938
- HOLY BALLS, EVERYBODY!

11:51.970 --> 11:54.302
BALLS, BRANNIGAN!
BALLS!

11:54.340 --> 11:56.535
BALLS! BALLS! BALLS!
AND TEQUILA!

11:56.580 --> 11:58.844
GUS, I'M TRAPPED!

11:58.880 --> 12:01.440
- BERNIE! BERNIE!

12:01.480 --> 12:03.687
- I'M TRAPPED IN A BO'ITLE
OF TEQUILA.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.142
- HE'S TRAPPED IN A BO'ITLE
OF TEQUILA, EVERYBODY!

12:05.190 --> 12:06.282
- BRANNIGAN!

12:06.320 --> 12:08.379
I MEAN, UH, BRANNIGAN,

12:08.420 --> 12:11.150
SO, ARE YOU READY TO START
YOUR VERY FIRST INVESTIGATION

12:11.190 --> 12:12.487
ALL PROPER LIKE?

12:12.530 --> 12:14.452
- I AM READY TO GO,
GO, GO, CHIEF.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.718
- GREAT! THEN YOU CAN GO, GO, GO
TALK TO YOUR THREE CONSULTANTS.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.364
- THE TH R--WHAT?

12:19.400 --> 12:21.868
- EVERYBODY, BACK UP!
CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN!

12:21.900 --> 12:23.333
GIVE THE MAN SOME SPACE.

12:23.370 --> 12:24.860
HE'S WARMING IT UP.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.003
- WHAT?
- DON'T YOU GET IT?

12:27.040 --> 12:29.941
WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN A GIFT
FROM THE GHOST OF JACK WEBB.

12:29.980 --> 12:31.470
MY GUT IS TELLING ME

12:31.510 --> 12:33.148
THAT THE WITCH,
THE GHOST WHISPERER,

12:33.180 --> 12:34.670
AND OUR OWN VERY TALENTED
PSYCHIC

12:34.720 --> 12:35.846
ARE GONNA HELP YOU
WRAP THIS CASE UP

12:35.880 --> 12:37.416
IN A NEAT,
LI'ITLE BEDAZZLED BOW

12:37.450 --> 12:38.678
THAT I'M SURE
YOU CAN MAKE BY HAND.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.210
- WELL, YES, I CAN.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.909
- DEFINITION OF INSANITY
IS DOING

12:41.960 --> 12:43.689
THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER
AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULTS.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.288
YOU KNOW, BOOZE ONLY NUMBS
THE PAIN TEMPORARILY, RIGHT?

12:45.330 --> 12:47.491
EXCUSE--EXCUSE US.

12:47.530 --> 12:49.225
YES.

12:49.260 --> 12:50.466
I KNOW, WE GO'ITA GO BACK
TO PILATES.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.365
- WHAT?
- OKAY.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.539
NOW CLEARLY THE GHOST HAS
A SOFT SPOT FOR THE BO'ITLE,

12:54.570 --> 12:55.889
SO I WOULD START WITH HIM.

12:55.940 --> 12:58.306
- THE GHOST, SIR?
- OH, ABSOLUTELY.

12:58.340 --> 12:59.898
THEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO GIVE
AN OFFERING TO THE WITCH--

12:59.940 --> 13:02.602
JUST A LOCK OF YOUR HAIR--
AND FINISH STRONG WITH SPENCER.

13:02.640 --> 13:06.701
OOH, WHO, IT APPEARS,
IS HAVING ONE HECK OF A VISION.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.741
- WARM IT UP, SHAWN!
- I CAN SEE THAT.

13:08.780 --> 13:11.783
- [grunting]

13:14.990 --> 13:17.720
[strained grunt, panting]

13:17.760 --> 13:21.548
- MY, OH, MY, I DO LOVE WATCHING
THAT MAN WORK.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.592
- HE MADE HIS WORMHOLE,
AND NOW HE'S RESTING.

13:24.630 --> 13:28.134
- YOU CAN TELL THAT GHOST THAT
I WILL SLAP HIM IN THE FACE!

13:28.170 --> 13:30.468
- I WISH YOU COULD FEEL
WHAT BERNIE IS DOING RIGHT NOW!

13:30.510 --> 13:31.807
- IT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE
ANY SENSE!

13:31.840 --> 13:33.535
- CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN!

13:33.580 --> 13:35.901
- FANTASTIC.
THE WHOLE TEAM IS HERE.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.306
- CHIEF, DO YOU REALLY THINK
WE NEED ALL THREE CONSULTANTS

13:38.350 --> 13:39.669
IN THE MORGUE
AT THE SAME TIME?

13:39.710 --> 13:41.712
- [chuckles]
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

13:41.750 --> 13:44.014
YOU HAVE THREE
INCREDIBLY GII-TED PARANORMALISTS

13:44.050 --> 13:45.642
AT YOUR DISPOSAL.

13:45.690 --> 13:47.555
NOT TO MENTION, ARGUABLY
THE FINEST CORONER

13:47.590 --> 13:48.887
IN THE STATE OF CALIFOR-NI-A.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.081
THERE'S THE WOOD-MAN!

13:51.130 --> 13:52.722
- HERE'S THAT VIAL, HAZEL.
- MM-HMM.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.126
- I'M SORRY, YOU CAN'T GIVE THAT
TO A CONSULTANT.

13:55.160 --> 13:56.593
- OH, NO.
GOD, NO, NO.

13:56.630 --> 13:58.268
THAT'S MY BLOOD.

13:58.300 --> 14:00.165
YOU SEE, HAZEL HERE
HAS GRACIOUSLY OFFERED

14:00.200 --> 14:02.668
TO UNDO A SPELL PUT ON ME
BY MY MOMMY--

14:02.700 --> 14:05.134
AHEM, MY MOTHER--
YEARS AGO.

14:05.170 --> 14:06.398
YOU CAN'T SEE THE EFFECTS.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.328
THE MAGIC OF CLOTHES.

14:08.380 --> 14:09.779
WHO ARE YOU?

14:09.810 --> 14:12.643
AND ARE YOU A FAN
OF SHOTGUN WEDDINGS?

14:12.680 --> 14:15.478
- UM, I'M, I'M THE NEW
HEAD DETECTIVE,

14:15.520 --> 14:17.249
BETSY BRANNIGAN,

14:17.290 --> 14:21.715
AND I BELIEVE THAT LOVE TRAVELS
AT VARYING SPEEDS.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.523
- WELL, BRANNIGAN,

14:23.560 --> 14:25.380
BELIEVE IT'S OBVIOUS
I HAVE STACKED THE DECK

14:25.430 --> 14:27.694
PRE'ITY HEAVILY IN YOUR FAVOR
FOR YOUR MAIDEN VOYAGE.

14:27.730 --> 14:29.721
TRY NOT TO LET IT GO
TERRIBLY, TERRIBLY WRONG.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.625
- UM, BERNIE,

14:31.670 --> 14:34.036
ALWAYS A PLEASURE, BABY.

14:34.070 --> 14:37.801
- MR. STRODE, UH, ANY,
UH, THING THUS FAR

14:37.840 --> 14:43.472
ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS
OF THE BODY?

14:43.510 --> 14:44.647
- [whispering]
SORRY.

14:44.680 --> 14:45.874
NO!
AHEM!

14:45.910 --> 14:47.844
NOTHING, NOTHING SO FAR.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.518
- I CAN SOLVE THIS
IN A SNAP.

14:49.550 --> 14:50.881
ALL I NEED IS
A LOCK OF STEIN'S HAIR

14:50.920 --> 14:52.808
AND ONE OF HIS TEETH.
IS THAT POSSIBLE?

14:52.850 --> 14:54.784
- GOT TO SAY NO TO THAT ONE.
- WE CAN SOLVE IT TOO.

14:54.820 --> 14:56.583
AS SOON AS STEIN PASSES
THROUGH TO THE Al-TERLIFE.

14:56.620 --> 14:59.157
WHICH, DEPENDING ON TRAFFIC,
COULD BE, YOU KNOW, SOON.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.727
- [whispering] ANY CHANCE
IT WAS A TOPICAL POISON?

15:01.760 --> 15:03.091
I MEAN, CHECK HIS HANDS.

15:03.130 --> 15:04.859
- YES, ALL SIGNS
DO POINT TO POISON.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.788
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S KEEP THAT
ON THE DOWN-LOW.

15:06.830 --> 15:08.695
- EXCUSE ME. CARE TO SHARE
WITH THE CLASS?

15:08.740 --> 15:10.298
- IT COULD BE TOPICAL POISON,
CHECK HIS HANDS.

15:10.340 --> 15:11.466
- WHAT?
- WHOOPS!

15:11.510 --> 15:12.863
IGNORE THAT.

15:12.910 --> 15:14.571
ALSO IGNORE
THAT THIS POISON WAS GIVEN

15:14.610 --> 15:15.599
VERY CLOSE TO HIS TIME
OF DEATH.

15:15.640 --> 15:16.971
OOPS.
[clears throat]

15:17.010 --> 15:19.103
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
THAT SOMEONE--

15:19.150 --> 15:22.779
- NOTHING AT ALL,
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

15:22.820 --> 15:24.447
- COME ON, GUS.

15:24.490 --> 15:27.459
WE GO'ITA BEAT THOSE QUACKS
TO A CLUE.

15:27.490 --> 15:30.687
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING
IN RANDALL'S DESK.

15:37.230 --> 15:38.959
- PROFESSOR STEIN,
IT'S TIME.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.332
- THANKS, GUPPY.

15:44.540 --> 15:46.735
- HEY, GUS!

15:46.770 --> 15:51.639
LOOKS LIKE RANDALL "THE GUPPY"
IS OUR KILLER.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.409
LASSIE!

15:53.450 --> 15:54.849
I'VE HAD A VISION
OF WHO KILLED STEIN.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.142
- WONDERFUL. SOCK IT TO ME.

15:56.180 --> 15:57.545
- I NEED HUMAN ENERGY!

15:57.590 --> 15:59.911
I NEED MAGIC HEAD!

15:59.950 --> 16:01.451
IT'S NOT ENOUGH!

16:01.490 --> 16:02.980
I'M MELTING.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.759
BRANNIGAN, JOIN THE CHAIN!

16:04.790 --> 16:06.621
- WHAT EXACTLY
IS HAPPENING HERE?

16:06.660 --> 16:08.821
- I BELIEVE HE WANTS TO BORROW
SOME OF YOUR LIFEFORCE.

16:08.860 --> 16:10.327
WELL GET IN THERE!

16:10.370 --> 16:11.769
DO YOU WANNA SOLVE
THE CASE OR NOT?

16:11.800 --> 16:12.994
COME ON, BE A TEAM PLAYER!

16:13.040 --> 16:14.564
- I'M ALWAYS A TEAM PLAYER!

16:14.600 --> 16:17.364
- [screaming]
- COME ON, BRANNIGAN.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.970
- OH! MY POWER'S
COMING BACK, JACK!

16:20.010 --> 16:21.671
ALMOST THERE.
GUS, FLAP IT.

16:21.710 --> 16:24.008
GUS, DO IT, FLAP IT.
LASSIE, JOIN IT, JOIN IT.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.472
YOU'RE THE CHERRY
ON THE TOP OF THE SUNDAE.

16:25.510 --> 16:27.114
- I DO LIKE CHERRIES.
[gaSPSJ

16:27.150 --> 16:29.448
- I...GOT IT.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.084
STEIN'S KILLER IS--

16:31.120 --> 16:32.917
- RANDALL FISHBECK,
STEIN'S ASSISTANT.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.487
- HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

16:35.520 --> 16:37.988
- WELL, YOU KNOW, I GOT
A TIP A LITTLE BIT AGO.

16:38.030 --> 16:39.179
AND I DISPATCHED
A COUPLE FLATFOOTS.

16:39.230 --> 16:40.891
OH, THERE THEY ARE NOW.

16:40.930 --> 16:42.727
GREAT JOB, GUYS!

16:50.740 --> 16:52.139
' [lips P0P]

16:52.170 --> 16:56.209
MAN, WE GOT LAPPED
BY THE SUPERNATURALS?

17:01.150 --> 17:03.118
- WHAT ARE WE DOING?

17:03.150 --> 17:04.811
YOU GONNA GO IN THERE AND PUT
THE SCREWS TO RANDALL OR WHAT?

17:04.850 --> 17:05.817
- NO, I'M GONNA LET BRANNIGAN.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.659
I MEAN, IT WAS HER COLLAR.

17:07.690 --> 17:09.112
IT'S ONLY FAIR I LET HER DO
THE INTERROGATION.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.525
- THAT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL OF YOU.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.323
[knock at door]
- LET ME IN!

17:12.360 --> 17:13.588
I SOLVED THIS CASE!
- ME TOO!

17:13.630 --> 17:14.699
BERNIE'S ALREADY IN THERE.
- IS HE?

17:14.730 --> 17:16.049
- YEAH.
- SHH!

17:16.100 --> 17:17.522
- Y'ALL CAN SUCK IT!
YOU CAN SUCK IT!

17:17.570 --> 17:19.162
BOTH OF YOU.
- YOU SUCK IT!

17:19.200 --> 17:21.134
- PLUS, SINCE THE TIP CAME
FROM A WITCH AND A GHOST,

17:21.170 --> 17:23.161
THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL THIS
LI'ITLE WEENIE KILLED ANYBODY.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.531
I GET TO WATCH BRANNIGAN
PUBLICLY CRASH AND BURN.

17:25.570 --> 17:26.639
- HMM.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.035
WHAT'S IT CALLED

17:28.080 --> 17:28.978
WHEN SOMEONE'S BEING
SWEET AND EVIL

17:29.010 --> 17:30.648
AT THE SAME TIME?

17:30.680 --> 17:32.272
- THERE ISN'T A WORD FOR IT.
- EXACTLY.

17:32.310 --> 17:33.641
THIS IS OUR CHANCE
TO FINALLY CREATE A WORD

17:33.680 --> 17:34.874
AND GET IT
IN THE DAMN DICTIONARY.

17:34.920 --> 17:35.841
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

17:35.880 --> 17:36.869
- GIVE IT TO ME.

17:36.920 --> 17:39.047
- SWEEVIL.

17:39.090 --> 17:40.557
- ALL RIGHT.

17:40.590 --> 17:42.148
HEY, RANDALL.

17:42.190 --> 17:46.229
- HI.
- DETECTIVE BETSY BRANNIGAN.

17:46.260 --> 17:48.626
SO, SAYS HERE THAT YOU WORKED

17:48.660 --> 17:50.594
FOR THE DEARLY DEPARTED
PROFESSOR STEIN

17:50.630 --> 17:52.325
FOR 15 YEARS.

17:52.370 --> 17:55.089
BUT HE NEVER GAVE YOU
ANY RECOGNITION OR CREDIT?

17:55.140 --> 17:56.960
NOT ONCE, IS THAT RIGHT?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.137
- YES.

17:58.170 --> 17:59.865
I MEAN, NO. UH--

17:59.910 --> 18:01.502
- I DON'T KNOW.

18:01.540 --> 18:04.179
NOT IN ANY OF HIS ARTICLES
OR LECTURES.

18:04.210 --> 18:07.816
AND HE DEDICATED HIS LAST BOOK
TO HIS PET TURTLE BEAUREGARD?

18:07.850 --> 18:08.771
[snickering]
I MEAN, COME ON.

18:08.820 --> 18:10.071
ON A PERSONAL NOTE,

18:10.120 --> 18:12.111
THAT JUST MUST MAKE
YOUR BLOOD BOIL.

18:12.150 --> 18:13.708
I MEAN, I KNOW IT WOULD MINE.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.250
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT IT DOES!

18:15.290 --> 18:17.349
BEAUREGARD NEVER DID SQUAT!

18:17.390 --> 18:20.257
- WHAT CAN A TURTLE DO...
- OH, HELL, SHE IS GOOD.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.222
IT'S GONNA BE TOUGHER THAN
I THOUGHT TO GET RID OF HER.

18:22.260 --> 18:23.693
- BERNIE'S IN THAT
INTERROGATION ROOM, YOU KNOW!

18:23.730 --> 18:25.459
- WHAT?
- YOU SAID HE WAS!

18:25.500 --> 18:27.024
- OH!
- WAIT. WHAT?

18:27.070 --> 18:28.628
DID YOU HEAR THAT, LASSIE?

18:28.670 --> 18:29.568
BERNIE'S IN THERE
WITH BRANNIGAN.

18:29.600 --> 18:30.999
- WOULD YOU STOP IT?

18:31.040 --> 18:32.667
- WHAT? HE'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE IN THERE.

18:32.710 --> 18:35.531
- THAT IS GREAT THINKING,
GUSTER.

18:39.180 --> 18:41.842
- SO Al-TER YEARS
OF STEIN'S ABUSE,

18:41.880 --> 18:44.212
YOU FINALLY SNAPPED LIKE
A TURTLE!

18:44.250 --> 18:45.717
I MEAN, HECK, ANYBODY WOULD.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.251
SO YOU PUT THE POISON
IN THE ONE THING

18:47.290 --> 18:49.884
THAT YOU KNEW THAT
THAT OLD, GERMOPHOBIC OLD MAN

18:49.920 --> 18:52.388
WOULD NEED BEFORE HE WALKED
ONTO THAT FILTHY STAGE.

18:52.430 --> 18:54.352
HAND SAiNITIZER!

18:54.400 --> 18:57.289
- YOU PUT THAT HAND SANITIZER
INTO HIS BIG FURRY MI'IT!

18:57.330 --> 18:58.968
DIDN'T YA?
- YES!

18:59.000 --> 19:00.160
- YES, RANDALL, YES!
- BUT I--

19:00.200 --> 19:01.792
WHAT IS HE--

19:01.840 --> 19:03.808
- THERE IS A GHOST IN HERE.
- WHAT?

19:03.840 --> 19:05.728
- AND HE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE!

19:05.770 --> 19:07.306
- CHIEF, I WAS--

19:07.340 --> 19:09.035
- NO, THE RULES OF THIS
DEPARTMENT ARE VERY CLEAR.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.298
THERE ARE NO CONSULTANTS
ALLOWED IN THE INTERVIEW ROOM

19:11.350 --> 19:13.511
WITHOUT THE PRESENCE
OF AN AUTHORIZED SHAMAN.

19:13.550 --> 19:15.518
I'M TALKING TO YOU, BERNIE!

19:15.550 --> 19:16.972
YOU KNOW THIS!
ALL RIGHT?

19:17.020 --> 19:18.487
NOW GET OU'ITA HERE!

19:18.520 --> 19:20.715
[cell phone rings]
HANG ON.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.149
- CASE CLOSED.

19:26.030 --> 19:27.657
- PROFESSOR STEIN,
IT'S TIME.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.725
- THANKS, GUPPY.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.625
- I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT, GUS.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.433
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

19:33.470 --> 19:36.792
WHY WOULD--
- WHOA.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.660
- GET UP OFF ME, HAZEL!

19:42.240 --> 19:44.947
- CALM DOWN, JUST CALM DOWN.

19:44.980 --> 19:47.414
- [exhales]

19:47.450 --> 19:49.668
- ALL RIGHT, NOW CHECK THIS OUT.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.915
WHY WOULD RANDALL
KILL PROFESSOR STEIN

19:51.950 --> 19:53.815
WHEN HE WAS FINALLY
ABOUT TO GET THE RECOGNITION

19:53.860 --> 19:55.350
HE SO RICHLY DESERVED?

19:55.390 --> 19:57.358
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
THANK YOU FOR NOTHING.

19:57.390 --> 19:59.085
THAT WAS THE LAB.

19:59.130 --> 20:00.654
APPARENTLY
THE HAND SANITIZER BO'ITLE

20:00.700 --> 20:01.598
TESTED CLEAN.

20:01.630 --> 20:03.120
THERE WAS NO TRACE OF POISON.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.889
I GUESS IT WAS DISCOLORED

20:04.930 --> 20:06.625
BECAUSE IT HAD EXPIRED
SIX MONTHS AGO.

20:06.670 --> 20:08.035
- GREAT. SO RANDALL'S
NOT A MURDERER.

20:08.070 --> 20:10.038
HE'S JUST SLOPPY AND NASTY.

20:10.070 --> 20:11.401
- I'M NOT SAYING I'M ANGRY.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.101
I'M JUST DISAPPOINTED.

20:13.140 --> 20:14.971
- I'M SORRY, CHIEF.

20:15.010 --> 20:17.376
- HEY, I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR AN INTERVENTION, BERNIE.

20:17.410 --> 20:19.742
- ALCOHOLISM IS NO JOKE.
- OKAY, SUPERFRIENDS.

20:19.780 --> 20:21.941
CAN WE GET BACK ON TRACK
AND FIND ME A NEW SUSPECT?

20:21.980 --> 20:24.915
ESPECIALLY YOU.

20:28.690 --> 20:30.328
- DUDE, IF RANDALL
DIDN'T KILL STEIN,

20:30.360 --> 20:34.694
WHO ELSE HAD MOTIVE?

20:34.730 --> 20:36.288
- COME ON, MAN!

20:36.330 --> 20:38.628
I JUST WANT A MINUTE
WITH PROFESSOR STEIN, MAN!

20:38.670 --> 20:39.762
- [whispering]
JAMES EARL CRAIG,

20:39.800 --> 20:41.267
THE MIND READER.

20:41.300 --> 20:42.494
THE GUY THAT STEIN OUTED
AS A FRAUD LAST YEAR.

20:42.540 --> 20:43.962
HE WAS GONNA DRAG HIM

20:44.010 --> 20:44.999
THROUGH THE MUD AGAIN
THIS YEAR.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.064
- I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU.

20:46.110 --> 20:47.202
YOU'RE SLURRING YOUR WORDS!

20:47.240 --> 20:48.832
AM ES JARL?

20:48.880 --> 20:49.835
JAM ES EARL!

20:49.880 --> 20:51.177
[hissing]

20:51.210 --> 20:52.541
GOOD BOYS.
GOOD BOYS.

20:52.580 --> 20:53.547
- YOU KNOW
YOU JUST HEARD ME SAY THAT.

20:53.580 --> 20:55.070
- YOU JUST TOOK THAT FROM US!

20:55.120 --> 20:56.212
- THERE IS NO WAY EARL DID THIS.

20:56.250 --> 20:57.911
HE IS A GII-TED, GENTLE SOUL.

20:57.950 --> 20:59.212
I'M NOT WASTING MY TIME.

20:59.250 --> 21:01.059
I WILL CONSULT THE SPIRITS,

21:01.090 --> 21:03.786
AND THEN I WILL BE AT THE SPA
GE'ITING MY FEET DONE.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.479
- YOU DON'T KNOW--
- CORNS.

21:05.530 --> 21:09.728
- DUDE, PLEASE TELL ME YOU KNOW
WHERE TO FIND JAMES EARL.

21:09.760 --> 21:10.988
- YOU'RE IN LUCK.

21:11.030 --> 21:12.691
RAN DALL!

21:12.730 --> 21:14.368
TURN THAT FROWN
UPSIDE DOWN, MAN.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.095
WE KNOW YOU DIDN'T KILL
PROFESSOR STEIN.

21:16.140 --> 21:17.732
- REALLY?
THANK YOU.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.059
BUT WE DO NEED TO FIND
JAMES EARL CRAIG

21:20.110 --> 21:21.509
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

21:21.540 --> 21:23.644
NOW DO YOU KNOW
AT WHAT HOTEL HE IS STAYING AT?

21:23.680 --> 21:25.045
- WHAT HOTEL?

21:25.080 --> 21:27.105
HE'S TOTALLY DESTITUTE.

21:27.150 --> 21:28.742
- HMM.

21:28.780 --> 21:30.316
- COME ON, MAN!

21:30.350 --> 21:33.410
I JUST WANT A MINUTE
WITH PROFESSOR STEIN, MAN!

21:33.460 --> 21:36.452
- DUDE, I THINK
I KNOW WHERE HE IS.

21:44.030 --> 21:46.521
- OKAY, WHAT IS
THIS ANIMAL'S NAME AGAIN?

21:46.570 --> 21:49.266
NO, WAIT, DON'T TELL ME.

21:49.300 --> 21:50.904
WHISKERS.

21:50.940 --> 21:52.805
MAX? PRINCESS?

21:52.840 --> 21:54.979
PRICILLA? PATCHES? PUMPKIN?
- YES! YES!

21:55.010 --> 21:56.932
- DID HE JUST
SAY "PUMPKIN" TO HIM?

21:56.980 --> 21:59.301
- GOT THAT NAME PRE'ITY QUICK.
- MAYBE HE'S THE REAL DEAL.

21:59.350 --> 22:00.647
- I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHY
I HAPPEN TO HAVE

22:00.680 --> 22:03.843
A DRAWING OF ONE
IN MY POCKET.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.040
- THAT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE
A PUMPKIN.

22:06.090 --> 22:07.853
- HEY, I'M A MIND READER, OKAY?

22:07.890 --> 22:09.152
NOT AN ARTIST.

22:09.190 --> 22:11.351
- THEN AGAIN--
EXCUSE US.

22:11.390 --> 22:13.529
NICE CAT.
- BAD SWEATER.

22:13.560 --> 22:15.027
- WE HAVE
A VERY IMPORTANT MA'ITER

22:15.060 --> 22:16.425
TO DISCUSS WITH YOU,
JAMES EARL CRAIG.

22:16.460 --> 22:19.759
- MAINLY, HOW YOU POISONED
PROFESSOR STEIN.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.438
- NOT HERE.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.062
WE CAN TALK IN MY PLACE.

22:23.100 --> 22:26.900
[hand drier humming]

22:26.940 --> 22:28.874
- THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE?
- PLEASE.

22:28.910 --> 22:30.332
OF COURSE NOT.

22:30.380 --> 22:33.042
[slaps door]
THIS IS MY PLACE.

22:33.080 --> 22:34.377
THIS PART OF THE BEACH
IS VIRTUALLY ABANDONED.

22:34.420 --> 22:36.149
AND IT'S JUST TEMPORARY.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.545
BROUGHT ALL MY STUFF
UP HERE TO SANTA BARBARA

22:37.590 --> 22:38.909
WHILE I TRY TO CLEAR MY NAME.

22:38.950 --> 22:39.985
- IS THAT TABLE
FROM Z GALLERIE?

22:40.020 --> 22:42.011
- YEAH.
- WOW.

22:42.060 --> 22:43.254
THIS STALL IS NICER
THAN MY APARTMENT IN COLLEGE.

22:43.290 --> 22:44.826
- YOU KNOW YOU LIVED AT HOME.

22:44.860 --> 22:46.259
- I'M JUST TRYING TO BE NICE,
SHAWN.

22:46.290 --> 22:47.951
- LET'S GET DOWN
TO BRASS TACKS, JAMES EARL.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.524
WE THINK YOU POISONED STEIN.
- INTERESTING.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.790
WHY WOULD I DO THAT
WHEN HIS BLESSING

22:51.830 --> 22:52.569
IS THE ONLY THING
THAT COULD POSSIBLY

22:52.600 --> 22:54.136
GET MY CAREER BACK ON TRACK?

22:54.170 --> 22:55.535
- THE CAREER YOU LOST

22:55.570 --> 22:57.401
WHEN HE OUTED YOU
AS A FRAUD LAST YEAR.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.533
- STEIN BRANDED ME A HOAX,
BECAUSE I WAS GE'ITING LAZY.

22:59.570 --> 23:01.379
INSTEAD OF READING MINDS,

23:01.410 --> 23:04.277
I WAS MERELY RELYING ON
MY KEEN POWERS OF OBSERVATION.

23:04.310 --> 23:06.175
- YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOUR DAMNED SELF.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.973
- I CAME UP HERE
TO PROVE TO STEIN

23:08.020 --> 23:09.544
THAT I'VE REDEDICATED MYSELF
TO MY CRAFT.

23:09.580 --> 23:11.116
BUT I COULDN'T GET NEAR HIM.

23:11.150 --> 23:12.082
I WENT TO HIS OFFICE,
THEY THREW ME OUT.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.678
I WENT TO HIS HOUSE,

23:13.720 --> 23:15.415
BUT HE WAS, YOU KNOW,
SHACKED UP WITH SOME HARLOT.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.314
- HARLOT? WHAT HARLOT?

23:17.360 --> 23:18.827
- I DON'T KNOW, I NEVER GOT
A GOOD LOOK AT HER.

23:18.860 --> 23:21.294
- STEIN'S HOUSE, YOU SAY?
- MM-HMM.

23:21.330 --> 23:23.924
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S--
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.119
I'M STILL A SUSPECT,

23:25.170 --> 23:29.630
AND DON'T LEAVE TOWN.

23:29.670 --> 23:33.436
YEAH, I'M THAT GOOD.

23:39.210 --> 23:40.939
- WAIT, THIS HOUSE WAS

23:40.980 --> 23:42.345
ON THE SANTA BARBARA EPISODE
OF GHOST HUNTERS.

23:42.380 --> 23:43.984
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HAUNTED.

23:44.020 --> 23:45.510
- HMM.

23:45.550 --> 23:46.482
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
WE DON'T BELIEVE

23:46.520 --> 23:48.954
IN THAT KIND OF NONSENSE.

23:58.570 --> 24:01.596
[door hinge creaking]

24:07.210 --> 24:09.075
- [whistles softly]
WHAT?

24:09.110 --> 24:10.372
- HAVEN'T WE PROVEN
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS

24:10.410 --> 24:11.502
THAT THERE'S
NO SUCH THING AS GHOSTS?

24:11.550 --> 24:14.075
- YES.
- SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

24:14.120 --> 24:17.817
- THE PROBLEM IS
THIS HOUSE MAY BE HAUNTED.

24:17.850 --> 24:19.943
- I SEE.
- MM-HMM.

24:19.990 --> 24:21.981
[grunts]

24:22.020 --> 24:25.478
MAN, THIS PLACE GIVES ME
THE HEEBIE-JEEBIES.

24:25.530 --> 24:26.986
- GIVES ME THE DRAB-BIES.

24:27.030 --> 24:28.122
THIS GUY SHOULD HIRE
JAMES EARL CRAIG

24:28.160 --> 24:29.650
AS HIS INTERIOR DECORATOR.

24:29.700 --> 24:34.239
THE THINGS THAT GUY CAN DO
TO A PUBLIC CAN, HUH?

24:34.270 --> 24:37.137
- DUDE, I THINK BEAUREGARD
IS DEAD.

24:37.170 --> 24:38.159
- NAH, MAN, HE'S JUST CHILLIN'.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.735
HE'S DOING HIS THING.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.169
BEAUREGARD IS CHILLIN'!

24:43.210 --> 24:45.098
DUDE GOT TO SAVE UP HIS JUICE.

24:45.150 --> 24:48.039
MATING SEASON.
HE'S A PLAYER.

24:48.080 --> 24:48.978
'CAUSE TURTLES'LL DO
THEIR THING, MAN.

24:49.020 --> 24:50.647
[wind chime jingles]

24:50.690 --> 24:51.748
THEY SEEM ALL SLOW AND DOCILE
UNDER THEIR SHELLS...

24:51.790 --> 24:53.553
- WHAT?
[grunting]

24:53.590 --> 24:55.080
- BUT THEN THEY STICK
THEIR LI'ITLE NECKS OUT,

24:55.120 --> 24:56.280
AND THEY'RE LIKE,
"WHAT'S UP?

24:56.320 --> 24:58.151
I'M READY TO GET DOWN!"

24:58.190 --> 25:00.158
THAT'S HOW THEY TALK TOO.

25:00.190 --> 25:02.158
PROFESSOR STEIN'S BEDROOM.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.667
WHERE ALL THE MAGIC HAPPENS.

25:03.700 --> 25:04.997
MEANING THAT THIS IS
WHERE PROFESSOR STEIN--

25:05.030 --> 25:08.033
- SHAWN.

25:08.070 --> 25:09.492
[air spraying]

25:13.110 --> 25:15.078
SPECT ER DETECT ER, SHAWN.

25:15.110 --> 25:16.668
YOU JUST GOT GHOST-TAGGED.

25:16.710 --> 25:19.270
IT'S AN ALARM
IN CASE OF SPECTRAL ACTIVITY.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.119
YOU'D KNOW THESE THINGS
IF YOU'D WATCH GHOST HUNTERS.

25:21.150 --> 25:22.048
- BUT YOU DO WATCH
GHOST HUNTERS.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.479
- YES, I DO.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.441
- AND YOU COULDN'T HAVE WARNED
MY ASS?

25:24.490 --> 25:26.014
- NO, I COULD NOT.

25:29.720 --> 25:32.257
- THIS IS A WEDDING RING, FOOL!

25:32.290 --> 25:33.427
- GUS, IT WAS HAZEL!
- WHAT?

25:33.460 --> 25:35.325
- COME IN HERE,
I'LL SHOW YOU.

25:35.360 --> 25:36.327
- I'M NOT COMING IN THERE!
- START BREAKING THE CASE.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.622
- YOU MUST THINK I'M STUPID.

25:37.670 --> 25:38.762
- SHE WAS HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH STEIN.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.222
- WHAT?

25:40.270 --> 25:41.532
- THAT'S WHY
HE KEEPS HER AROUND,

25:41.570 --> 25:42.867
EVEN THOUGH
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY A FAKE.

25:42.900 --> 25:44.299
WE GO'ITA GET BACK
TO THE SBPD.

25:44.340 --> 25:45.659
[muted roar]

25:45.710 --> 25:49.168
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

25:49.210 --> 25:50.370
GUS?

25:50.410 --> 25:53.049
[door shuts]

25:53.080 --> 25:54.616
- I GUESS I'M JUST FINDING IT
A LITTLE UNSE'ITLING,

25:54.650 --> 25:57.118
ALL THIS PSYCHIC--

25:57.150 --> 25:59.084
- [snoring]

25:59.120 --> 26:00.144
- CHIEF!
- HMM?

26:00.190 --> 26:01.555
WHAT?

26:01.590 --> 26:02.909
- HAVE YOU NOT HEARD
A WORD I SAID?

26:02.960 --> 26:04.325
- ABOUT WHAT?

26:04.360 --> 26:06.351
- * THE SPIRITS HAVE SPOKEN

26:06.390 --> 26:08.858
AND THAT WITCH HAZEL
IS OUR "KILLA."

26:08.900 --> 26:11.027
SHE WAS SHTUPPING STEIN.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.322
HE WAS ALL,
"HAZEL, I LOVE YOU."

26:13.370 --> 26:15.497
AND SHE WAS ALL,
"HOW 'BOUT YOU JUST BE

26:15.540 --> 26:17.337
THE PROFESSOR
OF GE'ITING UP ON THIS?"

26:17.370 --> 26:19.201
AND THEN HE WAS ALL,

26:19.240 --> 26:21.037
"HOW 'BOUT I TELL
YOUR HUSBAND ABOUT US?"

26:21.080 --> 26:23.036
- WHO WE THINK
MIGHT BE A WARLOCK.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.104
THEY'RE KNOWN TO BE
THE JEALOUS TYPES.

26:24.150 --> 26:25.742
- OH, COME ON, GUS.

26:25.780 --> 26:27.543
WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE
THAT HE'S A WARLOCK.

26:27.580 --> 26:30.219
- NO. NO, I AM
DEFINITELY FEELING WARLOCK.

26:30.250 --> 26:31.717
- WARLOCK.

26:31.750 --> 26:33.547
- OKAY, SO HAZEL
WAS SHTUPPING STEIN.

26:33.590 --> 26:35.148
AND SHE DIDN'T WANT TO RUIN
HER MARRIAGE.

26:35.190 --> 26:36.589
SO SHE KILLED HIM
TO KEEP HIM QUIET.

26:36.620 --> 26:38.588
- THAT'S OUR THEORY, CHIEF.
- I LOVE IT.

26:38.630 --> 26:39.949
- NO, THAT'S
A BIT OF A STRETCH.

26:39.990 --> 26:41.890
SEE, HAZEL BELIEVES IN WICCA,

26:41.930 --> 26:44.694
AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY
THAT REGARDS ALL LIFE AS SACRED.

26:44.730 --> 26:46.459
SO KILLING ANYTHING
WOULD BE ANATHEMA

26:46.500 --> 26:48.536
TO HER VERY CORE,
DON'T YOU KNOW?

26:48.570 --> 26:49.491
- HOW DOES SHE KNOW STUFF
LIKE THAT?

26:49.540 --> 26:50.802
- OOH.
- NO!

26:50.840 --> 26:52.307
NO, THE WITCH
IS DEFINITELY OUR PERP.

26:52.340 --> 26:53.432
SHE'S PROBABLY ALREADY
ON HER BROOM

26:53.470 --> 26:55.199
AND HALFWAY
OUT OF THIS CITY.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.605
BRANNIGAN, I NEED YOU TO CONTACT
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL,

26:56.640 --> 26:58.505
TELL THEM TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT.

26:58.550 --> 27:00.404
- I'M SORRY, FOR WHAT?
- FOR THE WITCH ON THE BROOM.

27:00.450 --> 27:02.372
- DO YOU REALLY NEED ME
TO DO THAT?

27:02.420 --> 27:03.682
- IF YOU WANT
TO CATCH THE KILLER.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.585
ALSO, PUT OUT AN APB.

27:05.620 --> 27:08.555
WE STILL DO THOSE, RIGHT?

27:08.590 --> 27:11.127
- OKAY, THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.229
THE, YOU KNOW...

27:12.260 --> 27:15.320
- HMM?

27:15.360 --> 27:19.399
- OKAY.

27:19.430 --> 27:21.534
- GOD, SHE'S ON THE ROPES.

27:21.570 --> 27:22.662
O'HARA'S AS GOOD AS BACK.

27:22.700 --> 27:24.236
[cell phone chimes]

27:24.270 --> 27:25.908
- OH! JUST GOT
A TEXT FROM RANDALL.

27:25.940 --> 27:28.408
I BET YOU THAT HE HAS EVIDENCE
THAT IMPLICATES THE WITCH.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.271
- WELL, GOSH, GOLLY,
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GET

27:30.310 --> 27:32.870
OVER THERE,
DON'T YOU KNOW?

27:36.020 --> 27:38.341
- [groans]

27:48.800 --> 27:50.392
- IT'S OVER, HAZEL!

27:50.430 --> 27:51.419
YOU HAD AN AFFAIR
WITH PROFESSOR STEIN.

27:51.470 --> 27:53.495
YOU LET HIM GET ALL...UP

27:53.530 --> 27:54.599
UNDER THAT CINGULUM.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.198
AND THEN YOU KILLED HIM

27:56.240 --> 27:57.537
BECAUSE HE WAS GONNA TELL
YOUR HUSBAND.

27:57.570 --> 27:59.208
- THE WARLOCK.
- MY HUSBAND'S A CPA.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.003
- REALLY?

28:01.040 --> 28:01.779
- I TOLD YOU SHE WASN'T MARRIED
TO A WARLOCK.

28:01.810 --> 28:02.902
- LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

28:02.940 --> 28:04.544
IS IT AN AUTOMATIC RED FLAG

28:04.580 --> 28:05.877
IF I TAKE
THE HOME OFFICE DEDUCTION?

28:05.910 --> 28:07.138
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

28:07.180 --> 28:08.169
- I KNEW IT.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.539
HE'S A WARLOCK.

28:09.580 --> 28:10.808
- YOU KILLED STEIN
TO KEEP HIM QUIET.

28:10.850 --> 28:12.408
AND THEN
RANDALL "GUPPY" FISHHOOK

28:12.450 --> 28:13.439
FOUND OUT,
AND YOU KILLED HIM TOO.

28:13.490 --> 28:14.787
- MM-HMM.

28:14.820 --> 28:17.015
- CAWW!
- MA'AM, CALM DOWN.

28:17.060 --> 28:18.550
- AAH...

28:18.590 --> 28:20.797
- I ADMIT I WAS HAVING
A FLING WITH STEIN.

28:20.830 --> 28:22.297
NOTHING SERIOUS.

28:22.330 --> 28:23.251
I HAVE A THING
FOR INCONTINENT MEN.

28:23.300 --> 28:25.427
DON'T YOU JUDGE ME.

28:25.470 --> 28:26.562
ANYWAY, I JUST CAME
TO APOLOGIZE TO RANDALL

28:26.600 --> 28:28.158
FOR HAVING HIM ARRESTED.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.792
BUT WHEN I GOT HERE
HE WAS ALREADY DEAD.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.501
- YOU GOT TO COME UP WITH
SOMETHING BETTER THAN THAT.

28:31.540 --> 28:33.303
- WE KNOW SWEEVIL, BABY.

28:33.340 --> 28:35.228
- SWEEVI L?

28:35.280 --> 28:37.202
- IT'S JUST A WORD GUS AND I
CREATED FROM SCRATCH!

28:37.240 --> 28:39.470
- MM-HMM. SWEET...
- EQUAL PARTS. AND EVIL.

28:39.510 --> 28:40.545
- WE'RE HOPING TO GET IT
INTO THE NEXT EDITION

28:40.580 --> 28:42.275
OF WEBSTER'S.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.412
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT?

28:43.450 --> 28:45.543
- THAT IS PRE'ITY COOL.

28:45.590 --> 28:46.614
- WE KNOW.
WE DOIN' OUR THING.

28:46.650 --> 28:48.186
both: OH!

28:48.220 --> 28:49.517
[both grunting]

28:49.560 --> 28:50.788
_ - NO!
[grunts]

28:50.830 --> 28:52.627
GOSH! OH!

28:52.660 --> 28:54.890
THIS IS NOT GONNA REFLECT WELL
ON US.

28:54.930 --> 28:56.295
- WE JUST NEED TO GET
OUR STORY STRAIGHT.

28:56.330 --> 28:58.366
- [coughing]
- [groans]

28:58.400 --> 29:00.129
HAZEL TURNED ME
INTO A RUBBER TREE.

29:00.170 --> 29:01.535
- AND I WAS A CHICKEN.
[clucks]

29:01.570 --> 29:02.662
- WHAT?

29:02.700 --> 29:03.928
- A CHICKEN.
[clucks]

29:03.970 --> 29:05.801
- YEAH, AND WHEN
THE SPELLS WORE OFF,

29:05.840 --> 29:07.603
SHE WAS LONG GONE.

29:07.640 --> 29:08.971
- BUT I STILL HAVE THE URGE
TO SCRATCH AND PECK.

29:09.010 --> 29:10.705
- AND PUSH OUT BIG OL' EGGS.

29:10.740 --> 29:13.641
- NOT BIG OL' EGGS, SHAWN.

29:13.680 --> 29:16.069
- WELL, I, FOR ONE,
AM JUST SO GLAD

29:16.120 --> 29:17.781
THAT YOU BOTH MADE IT BACK
INTO HUMAN FORM

29:17.820 --> 29:18.844
FULLY INTACT.

29:18.890 --> 29:20.539
- [chuckles]

29:20.590 --> 29:21.682
- THANKS, LASSIE,
WE'RE STILL ASHAMED.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.325
- [clucks]

29:24.360 --> 29:25.725
- WAIT, YOU'RE SERIOUS?

29:25.760 --> 29:28.251
YOU BELIEVE THEIR STORY?

29:28.300 --> 29:29.653
- WHY WOULDN'T I?

29:29.700 --> 29:31.827
- HE'S MOVING HIS HEAD
LIKE A CHICKEN.

29:31.870 --> 29:33.622
- WELL, YEAH, THERE'S BOUND
TO BE SOME RESIDUAL EFFECT.

29:33.670 --> 29:35.729
- OKAY, I GUESS
I JUST DON'T KNOW

29:35.770 --> 29:37.397
WHAT TO BELIEVE ANYMORE,
LEAST OF ALL MY OWN JUDGMENT.

29:37.440 --> 29:40.432
BUT, I MEAN, I WAS SURE
THAT HAZEL WAS INNOCENT.

29:40.470 --> 29:42.574
- HMM.

29:42.610 --> 29:44.703
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA GO BACK
TO THE STATION

29:44.750 --> 29:45.842
AND--AND RETHINK THINGS.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.848
UH, MAYBE EVERYTHING. I--

29:47.880 --> 29:49.768
- [clucks]

29:49.820 --> 29:52.880
- DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP
TOO MUCH.

29:52.920 --> 29:54.456
[whispering]
WE WERE SO CLOSE.

29:54.490 --> 29:55.787
JUST ONE MORE ACT

29:55.820 --> 29:57.151
OF OUTRAGEOUS,
NONSENSICAL BUFFOONERY,

29:57.190 --> 29:58.350
AND SHE WILL TURN IN HER BADGE

29:58.390 --> 29:59.322
AND RUN FOR THE HILLS.

29:59.360 --> 30:01.419
- YEAH.

30:01.460 --> 30:02.825
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M THE ONE
THAT'S GONNA SAY THIS,

30:02.860 --> 30:04.623
BUT SHOULDN'T WE
BE FOCUSING ON SOLVING THE CASE?

30:04.670 --> 30:06.695
- YES.
YES, WE SHOULD.

30:06.730 --> 30:08.561
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
WOODY FOUND TRACES OF CYANIDE

30:08.600 --> 30:10.363
IN STEIN'S BLOOD.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.231
SO THE POISON WASN'T TOPICAL,
IT WAS INGESTED.

30:12.270 --> 30:13.032
I'M GUESSING
IT WAS THE SAME METHOD

30:13.070 --> 30:14.571
USED ON OLD RANDALL.

30:14.610 --> 30:16.305
- SHE'S GONE.

30:16.340 --> 30:17.602
YOU CAN STOP PECKING.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.608
- LOOK, WE NEED TO FIND HAZEL.

30:19.650 --> 30:21.538
- WELL, I'VE ALREADY ALERTED
HIGHWAY PATROL

30:21.580 --> 30:22.672
AND AMTRAK
AND AIRPORT SECURITY.

30:22.720 --> 30:23.914
HAZEL'S TRAPPED IN THE CITY.

30:23.950 --> 30:25.884
SHE'S GOT NOWHERE TO GO.

30:25.920 --> 30:28.354
- JAMES EARL SHOULD BE HERE
INSTEAD OF YOUR CHARLATAN ASS.

30:28.390 --> 30:30.813
HE IS A GIFTED MIND READER
AND A DEAR FRIEND.

30:30.860 --> 30:34.796
- ACTUALLY, LASSIE, SHE DOES.

30:34.830 --> 30:36.821
- HAZEL!
- [laughs] HAZEL!

30:36.860 --> 30:38.964
- WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!

30:39.000 --> 30:40.661
[whispering]
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

30:40.700 --> 30:42.236
- WHAT THE HELL?
- WHOA! OH, MY GOSH.

30:42.270 --> 30:42.929
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- SORRY, SIR.

30:42.970 --> 30:44.301
- GET OUT OF HERE!

30:44.340 --> 30:45.364
- AS YOU WERE.
- CARRY ON.

30:45.410 --> 30:46.468
- AS YOU WERE.
- GET OUT!

30:46.510 --> 30:48.432
- MUST BE EUROPEAN.
- WHAT?

30:48.480 --> 30:49.572
- NOTHING.
- LOOK.

30:49.610 --> 30:50.679
JAMES EARL'S STUFF WAS GONE.

30:50.710 --> 30:55.613
YOU THINK HE WENT BACK TO L.A.?

30:55.650 --> 30:56.742
- YES!

30:56.780 --> 30:58.839
DAMN IT!

30:58.890 --> 31:01.415
MUST HAVE GONE BACK
TO THE CITY OF ANGELS!

31:01.460 --> 31:03.416
- BACK TO HIS
HOME-SWEET-STORM DRAIN!

31:03.460 --> 31:05.621
- WE JUST MISSED HIM, GUS!

31:05.660 --> 31:06.922
- DANG!

31:06.960 --> 31:08.723
- DAMN IT! HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

31:08.760 --> 31:10.421
- SPIRITS TOLD ME YOU WERE HERE.

31:10.460 --> 31:12.599
AND THE SPIRITS DON'T LIE.
- MM-HMM.

31:12.630 --> 31:14.359
- AND I'M GONNA CALL LASSIE

31:14.400 --> 31:16.368
AND TELL HIM THAT WE FOUND
OUR MURDERING WITCH.

31:16.400 --> 31:17.367
- NO, SHE DIDN'T DO IT.

31:17.400 --> 31:18.901
- SHH'
- SHH!

31:18.940 --> 31:21.170
NOBODY'S TALKIN' TO YOU.

31:27.950 --> 31:30.612
- OH, MAN.

31:30.650 --> 31:32.789
HAZEL'S INNOCENT.
- WHAT?

31:32.820 --> 31:34.014
- SHE'S NOT PLO'ITING
HER ESCAPE, GUS.

31:34.060 --> 31:35.618
SHE'S IN HERE WITH JAMES EARL

31:35.660 --> 31:36.513
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHO THE REAL KILLER IS,

31:36.560 --> 31:37.959
CLEAR HER NAME.

31:37.990 --> 31:39.628
I LIKE WHAT YOU DID
WITH THE NEW PLACE.

31:39.660 --> 31:40.957
- OH, YEAH, THANKS,
IT TURNED OUT NICE.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.888
- PRE'ITY GOOD, I GO'ITA SAY.

31:42.930 --> 31:45.364
- I'M THE BEST THERE EVER WAS,
WITCHIE-POO.

31:45.400 --> 31:46.867
I'M ALSO SUPERMAN ENOUGH
TO ADMIT

31:46.900 --> 31:47.821
WHEN THE SPIRITS ARE WRONG.

31:47.870 --> 31:49.269
THEY WERE.

31:49.300 --> 31:50.039
THE ONLY THING
YOU'RE GUILTY OF

31:50.070 --> 31:51.230
IS CHEATING ON YOUR HUSBAND.

31:51.270 --> 31:53.864
- THAT POOR CUCKOLDED WARLOCK.

31:53.910 --> 31:55.707
- I TOLD YOU,
HE'S AN ACCOUNTANT.

31:55.740 --> 31:57.002
- WHAT DID WE MISS?

31:57.040 --> 31:58.268
- HAZEL DIDN'T DO IT, GARTH.

31:58.310 --> 31:59.538
- WE'RE BACK TO SQUARE ONE.

31:59.580 --> 32:00.774
- WELL, YEAH, YEAH.

32:00.810 --> 32:02.812
- WHAT'S BERNIE SAYING?

32:02.850 --> 32:03.874
- BERNIE SAYS HE KNEW HAZEL
DIDN'T DO IT THE WHOLE TIME.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.888
' [lips P0P]

32:05.920 --> 32:07.387
- AND HE WONDERS WHERE A BROTHER
CAN GET A 40 AROUND HERE.

32:07.420 --> 32:09.081
WHAT?

32:09.120 --> 32:10.610
YOU KNOW WHAT, THE MINUTE WE GET
BACK TO ANCHORAGE,

32:10.660 --> 32:12.127
YOU'RE GOING
INTO A 12-STEP PROGRAM.

32:12.160 --> 32:13.457
CALM DOWN, BERNIE.

32:13.490 --> 32:14.855
JUST CALM DOWN!

32:14.900 --> 32:16.299
DANG.

32:16.330 --> 32:17.729
HE PASSED OUT.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.967
- OKAY, GUYS,
CAN WE PLEASE JUST STOP

32:20.000 --> 32:22.161
ALL OF THIS
RIDICULOUS GRANDSTANDING?

32:22.200 --> 32:23.838
I MEAN, LOOK AT US.

32:23.870 --> 32:26.009
WE ARE TALENTED
CRIME SOLVERS, ALL.

32:26.040 --> 32:27.439
- EXCEPT JAMES EARL.

32:27.470 --> 32:29.074
- RIGHT, HE GOT DEBUNKED
LAST YEAR.

32:29.110 --> 32:30.805
- HE DID, HE DID.
- EVEN THE MADE-UP GUY.

32:30.840 --> 32:31.977
WE SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER.

32:32.010 --> 32:33.477
NOW LET'S UNITE.

32:33.510 --> 32:36.377
LIKE A SAD VERSION
OF THE AVENGERS.

32:36.420 --> 32:37.717
LET'S HEAD BACK
TO THE POLICE STATION,

32:37.750 --> 32:40.514
LET'S CLEAR
HAZEL'S DECENT NAME,

32:40.550 --> 32:41.482
AND LET'S SOLVE
THIS DAMN THING!

32:41.520 --> 32:42.680
[grunts]

32:42.720 --> 32:43.982
YOU COMING OR WHAT, GARTH?

32:44.030 --> 32:45.827
- WE'LL MEET YOU THERE.

32:45.860 --> 32:47.589
BERNIE'S THROWING UP.
- OH, BOY.

32:47.630 --> 32:48.722
- [sighs]

32:48.760 --> 32:51.160
COME ON, BUDDY.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.929
- THERE THEY ARE!

32:52.970 --> 32:54.460
NICE WORK, SPENCER.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.036
HAZEL LAZARUS,
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST

32:56.070 --> 32:57.867
FOR THE MURDER OF--
- SHE'S INNOCENT, LASSIE.

32:57.900 --> 32:59.731
- MM-HMM.
- HUH? BASED ON WHAT?

32:59.770 --> 33:00.759
- A LITTLE LOTION,
A LITTLE POTION,

33:00.810 --> 33:02.368
AND A WHOLE LO'ITA THIS.

33:02.410 --> 33:03.775
- YEAH, BUT SPENCER,
I DO NOT HAVE TIME

33:03.810 --> 33:05.107
FOR YOUR MONKEYSHINES
NOR YOUR SHENANIGANS.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.970
I NEED VERIFIABLE EVIDENCE.

33:07.010 --> 33:08.568
- FINE. I'M SURE WOODY
PINPOINTED THE TIME AT WHICH

33:08.620 --> 33:09.746
RANDALL "THE KINGFISHER"
FISH BECK

33:09.780 --> 33:11.088
WAS POISON ED.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.917
- YEAH, BETWEEN
1:00 AND 2:00 PM. SO?

33:12.950 --> 33:15.089
- I WAS WITH JAMES EARL CRAIG.
- AT HIS RESIDENCE.

33:15.120 --> 33:18.157
- FINE. WHAT'S THE ADDRESS?

33:18.190 --> 33:19.657
- LEADBE'ITER BEACH.
- MM-HMM, PUBLIC RESTROOM.

33:19.690 --> 33:21.521
- MOP CLOSET.

33:21.560 --> 33:22.925
- OF COURSE IT IS.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.996
- CAN ANYONE AT LEAST VERIFY
YOUR ALIBI?

33:25.030 --> 33:26.190
- A LOT OF HEAW MEN
IN SWIMTRUNKS.

33:26.230 --> 33:28.039
- I'M PRE'ITY SURE SHE'S CLEAN.

33:28.070 --> 33:33.098
- THIS WHOLE STORY SEEMS
OUTRAGEOUSLY RIDICULOUS!

33:33.140 --> 33:34.732
WHICH IS WHY
I NEED YOU TO REPEAT IT

33:34.780 --> 33:36.600
WORD-FOR-WORD
IN FRONT OF BRANNIGAN.

33:36.640 --> 33:37.868
- OKAY, LASSIE,
MAY I HAVE A WORD?

33:37.910 --> 33:39.741
- WHAT ARE WE DOING?
SHE'S OUT THERE.

33:39.780 --> 33:41.509
I'LL JUST--I'LL CALL HER IN,
AND YOU CAN SAY IT.

33:41.550 --> 33:43.575
- DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT MAYBE, JUST MAYBE,

33:43.620 --> 33:45.247
YOU'RE TRYING A LITTLE TOO HARD
TO PUSH BETSY OUT?

33:45.290 --> 33:46.245
I MEAN, HER NAME IS BETSY.

33:46.290 --> 33:47.985
- NO! NO, I DO NOT!

33:48.020 --> 33:50.352
SHE IS ON THE ROPES.
LISTEN TO ME.

33:50.390 --> 33:52.085
I ALREADY SAW A REQUEST
FOR A TRANSFER

33:52.130 --> 33:54.223
ON HER DESK,
IT WAS HALFWAY FILLED OUT!

33:54.260 --> 33:56.751
SHE'S ON THE CUSP!
WE NEED TO PUSH HER OVER!

33:56.800 --> 33:58.358
LET'S CLOSE THIS SON OF A BITCH!

33:58.400 --> 34:01.528
I NEED YOU TO KICK IT up TO 15.
- [gaSPSJ

34:01.570 --> 34:03.697
NO. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

34:03.740 --> 34:05.935
LOOK, ANY JACKASSERY
ABOVE A LEVEL 12

34:05.970 --> 34:07.562
AND GUS BREAKS INTO
REESE'S PIECES.

34:07.610 --> 34:09.032
- IT'S TRUE.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.069
- IT'S A RISK
I'M WILLING TO TAKE.

34:10.110 --> 34:12.647
- WHAT?
- THAT IS COLD-BLOODED.

34:12.680 --> 34:14.272
- OH, DETECTIVE BRANNIGAN.

34:14.320 --> 34:18.086
A MOMENT OF YOUR VERY,
VERY VALUABLE TIME, PLEASE.

34:18.120 --> 34:20.611
IT WOULD APPEAR
THAT WE STILL HAVE

34:20.650 --> 34:22.117
A KILLER ON THE LOOSE.

34:22.160 --> 34:24.583
- WE'RE HERE! WE'RE HERE!

34:24.630 --> 34:26.552
- EXCELENTE!

34:26.590 --> 34:27.989
OUR ENTIRE TEAM
OF CRACK CONSULTANTS

34:28.030 --> 34:29.827
IS READY TO GO.

34:29.860 --> 34:30.895
AT THIS MOMENT, I WOULD LIKE
TO TURN THINGS OVER

34:30.930 --> 34:32.022
TO OUR VERY GIFTED PSYCHIC,

34:32.070 --> 34:36.598
MR. SHAWN SPENCER.

34:36.640 --> 34:40.861
- [humming]

34:40.910 --> 34:42.537
OKAY, Y'ALL.

34:42.580 --> 34:43.979
LET US ALL SUMMON
OUR COLLECTIVE POWERS

34:44.010 --> 34:46.103
AND MAKE MAGIC
AS WE HAVE NE'ER...

34:46.150 --> 34:50.018
MADE IT BEFORE.

34:50.050 --> 34:51.586
- YOUR SHOES? REALLY?

34:51.620 --> 34:53.042
- IT IS AN OFFERING
TO THE SPIRITS.

34:53.090 --> 34:54.455
- GUS, I NEED YOU ON BASS.

34:54.490 --> 34:56.754
- HAZEL, YOU'RE ON "UUUHS."

34:56.790 --> 34:57.779
- FUGEE TYPE "UUUHS"?

34:57.820 --> 34:58.821
- ARE THERE ANY OTHER KIND?

34:58.860 --> 35:00.054
- I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT.

35:00.090 --> 35:01.955
- * SPIRITS

35:02.000 --> 35:04.628
- * SPIRITS
- * SPIRITS

- * AND ALSO
THE FIRST DUDE *

35:19.810 --> 35:21.949
- * SPIRITS

35:21.980 --> 35:23.345
- BERNIE'S HARMONIZING.

35:23.380 --> 35:26.110
- * TELL HIM TO SUCK IT

35:26.150 --> 35:28.311
- * SUCK IT
- * SUCK IT

35:28.360 --> 35:30.248
- HE'S A BARITONE.

35:30.290 --> 35:31.848

35:31.890 --> 35:34.051
- * MIDDLE

TEAM, TEAM, TEAM, TEAM,

35:44.210 --> 35:48.032
TEAM, TEAM, TEAM, TEAM,
TEAM, TEAM, TEAM...

35:48.070 --> 35:50.334
- WHO ARE YOU?
- OH!

35:50.380 --> 35:52.678
THAT'S RECENTLY-DISCREDITED
MIND READER JAMES EARL.

35:52.710 --> 35:53.699
HE'S A HOMELESS MAN.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.741
- I LOVE IT! YOU'RE IN!

35:55.780 --> 35:57.611
all: TEAM, TEAM, TEAM...

35:57.650 --> 35:59.083
- WHOA.

35:59.120 --> 36:01.850
- TEAM, TEAM, TEAM,
TEAM, TEAM, TEAM--

36:01.890 --> 36:04.484
- GUS!
- WHAT? WHAT?

36:04.530 --> 36:06.327
- SHOW SOME RESPECT, MAN.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.518
- REMEMBER, YOU'RE A FIGHTER!

36:10.560 --> 36:11.629
HE'S A FIGHTER, RIGHT?
- YES, HE IS.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.194
HANG IN, JAMES EARL.

36:13.230 --> 36:14.561
- IT'S OKAY,
YOU'LL LAND ON YOUR FEET.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.828
YOU'RE GONNA BE
JUST FINE, EARL.

36:15.870 --> 36:17.189
- [gasping]
- WHAT? TELL ME?

36:17.240 --> 36:20.061
[stammering]
OH, YOU WANNA GO HIGH FIVES?

36:20.110 --> 36:24.035
WE CAN GO--

36:24.080 --> 36:27.004
- BERNIE HAUNTED MY AUNT JUNIE'S
PLACE UP IN BETHEL.

36:27.050 --> 36:29.678
- THAT AND YOUR HANDS
ARE A CESSPOOL OF GERMS.

36:31.220 --> 36:33.984
- I WAS WRONGFULLY DB'D!

36:34.020 --> 36:35.317
- HAZEL.
- HMM?

36:35.360 --> 36:37.009
- HAVE YOU EVER BEEN DB'D?

36:37.060 --> 36:39.085
- ARE YOU CRAZY?
ONLY THE FRAUDS GET DEBUNKED.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.894
- HELLS YEAH, THEY DO.
- YEAH.

36:41.930 --> 36:43.329
[mouthing word]

36:45.070 --> 36:46.992
- OKAY, EVERYBODY, BACK UP.

36:47.030 --> 36:48.839
GIVE THE MAN SOME ROOM.
CALM DOWN.

36:48.870 --> 36:51.304
HE'S HAVING A VISION, PEOPLE.
CALM DOWN.

36:51.340 --> 36:53.001
HE THINKS HE'S IN PHILLY
RIGHT NOW, BUT WAIT.

36:53.040 --> 36:56.339
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.

36:56.380 --> 36:59.042
HE REALIZES HE'S NOT IN PHILLY,
AND HE'S READY TO GO.

36:59.080 --> 37:00.877
- I KNOW WHO THE KILLER IS.

37:00.910 --> 37:05.813
OR SHOULD I SAY "KILLERS"?

37:05.850 --> 37:08.114
IT WAS YOU, GARTH,
WHO POISONED PROFESSOR STEIN,

37:08.150 --> 37:09.811
WASN'T IT?

37:09.860 --> 37:12.351
AND PERHAPS BERNIE, THE GHOST,
GAVE AN ASSIST

37:12.390 --> 37:14.654
WHILE DOWNING A HIGHBALL
OF WOODFORD RESERVE, NEAT,

37:14.700 --> 37:16.156
WATER BACK.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.498
- THE MAN'S DELUSIONAL.

37:18.530 --> 37:20.327
- YOU SLIPPED INTO HIS LAB
AND SPIKED HIS TEA, DIDN'T YOU?

37:20.370 --> 37:23.191
'CAUSE YOU KNEW YOU WERE
ABOUT TO BE EXPOSED AS A FRAUD.

37:23.240 --> 37:26.164
OR AS THE SUPERNATURAL FOLK
LIKE TO CALL IT, DEBUNKED,

37:26.210 --> 37:27.734
OR DB'D FOR SHORT.

37:27.770 --> 37:29.237
GUS, HAVE I MADE
THAT PART CLEAR?

37:29.280 --> 37:31.009
- YES, YOU DID!

37:31.040 --> 37:32.940
- JUST LIKE PROFESSOR STEIN DID
TO EARL LAST YEAR,

37:32.980 --> 37:34.447
YOU SAW THAT IT RUINED HIM,

37:34.480 --> 37:36.141
AND YOU WEREN'T ABOUT
TO LET THAT HAPPEN.

37:36.180 --> 37:39.081
- OKAY. NOW BERNIE AND I
ARE OFFICIALLY OFFENDED.

37:39.120 --> 37:41.588
- WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T BE.
I PUT A LO'ITA THOUGHT INTO THIS.

37:41.620 --> 37:43.986
YOU FIGURED IT OUT BEFORE
THE CONVENTION, DIDN'T YOU?

37:44.020 --> 37:46.818
AND YOU KNEW THAT THE COPS
WOULD GO AFTER THE DUDE

37:46.860 --> 37:48.851
WITH THE MOST MOTIVE
TO COMMIT THE MURDER.

37:48.900 --> 37:50.959
AND THAT WAS JAMES EARL.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.422
- ISN'T THIS AMAZING TO WATCH?

37:52.470 --> 37:54.438
- YEAH, AMAZING.

37:54.470 --> 37:56.836
- ADMI'ITEDLY, IT TOOK US A WHILE
TO GET ON TO EARL.

37:56.870 --> 37:58.189
FIRST, WE THOUGHT
IT WAS GOOD OLD RANDALL.

37:58.240 --> 38:00.162
TURNS OUT, HE JUST HAD
"RED HERRING" SCRIBBLED

38:00.210 --> 38:02.337
ACROSS
HIS SOCIALLY AWKWARD FACE.

38:02.380 --> 38:04.132
HE FIGURED OUT THE TRUTH
BUT HE COULDN'T TELL A SOUL

38:04.180 --> 38:06.569
BECAUSE YOU POISONED
HIS TEA TOO.

38:06.610 --> 38:08.146
IS EVERYONE FOLLOWING THIS?

38:08.180 --> 38:09.340
BRANNIGAN, HOW YOU DOING
DOWN THERE?

38:09.380 --> 38:11.382
- I'M DOING GREAT, THANKS.

38:11.420 --> 38:13.149
- YOU AND BERNIE BRAZENLY
DECIDED TO STAY PUT

38:13.190 --> 38:15.010
RIGHT HERE IN SANTA BARBARA,

38:15.060 --> 38:18.427
SOLVE PROFESSOR STEIN'S MURDER,
TAKE ALL THE CREDIT,

38:18.460 --> 38:21.793
AND FRAME AN INNOCENT MAN
FOR THE CRIMES YOU COMMI'ITED.

38:21.830 --> 38:23.422
- ARE YOU FINISHED
WITH THIS NONSENSE YET?

38:23.460 --> 38:25.098
- I THINK SO, GARTH.
I THINK I'M CLOSE.

38:25.130 --> 38:26.461
GOD, I HOPE SO.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.866
WE THOUGHT IT WAS HAZEL,

38:28.900 --> 38:30.436
BUT DETECTIVE BRANNIGAN
WAS DEAD-ON-BALLS ACCURATE.

38:30.470 --> 38:34.839
SHE'S NO MURDERER.
SHE JUST HAS A TOUCH OF SWEEVIL.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.178
WHAT'S UP, SON?

38:37.210 --> 38:39.269
HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW, BERNIE?

38:39.310 --> 38:42.347
HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW?

38:42.380 --> 38:44.314
AND THEN WE CIRCLED
ALL THE WAY BACK TO EARL.

38:44.350 --> 38:46.011
GIFTED, HOMELESS,

38:46.050 --> 38:48.610
INTERIOR DECORATING MIND READER
THAT HE IS,

38:48.660 --> 38:51.049
YOU POISONED HIM
JUST AS HE UNCOVERED THE TRUTH.

38:51.090 --> 38:53.024
BUT NOT BEFORE HE WROTE
SOME PRE'ITY DAMNING EVIDENCE

38:53.060 --> 38:55.654
ON HIS MI'ITS.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.669
IS EVERYTHING I JUST SAID RIGHT,
GARTH?

38:58.700 --> 39:00.224
BERNIE?

39:00.270 --> 39:02.989
- SHAWN, I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.928
IT TURNS OUT
YOU ARE THE REAL DEAL.

39:04.970 --> 39:06.369
AND I HATE TO SAY THIS,

39:06.410 --> 39:08.378
BUT I STRONGLY SUSPECT
THAT BERNIE DID IT!

39:08.410 --> 39:10.071
- [gaSPSJ

39:10.110 --> 39:11.236
- WELL, GOOD LUCK SELLING THAT
TO THE JURY.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.804
- YEAH.

39:12.850 --> 39:13.942
- BRANNIGAN,
CARE TO DO THE HONORS?

39:13.980 --> 39:15.675
- WITH PLEASURE, SIR.

39:15.720 --> 39:18.541
- BOOM!
THAT'S HOW WE DO IT, PEOPLE.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.217
EVERY CASE, EVERY WEEK.

39:20.250 --> 39:22.286
AND SOMETIMES,
WE DO IT LIKE THIS.

39:22.320 --> 39:23.878
WHAT?
WHAT?

39:27.830 --> 39:30.822
- LASSIE, YOU LOOK
POSITIVELY SWEEVIL.

39:30.860 --> 39:32.293
- WELL, THAT MIGHT BE
BECAUSE

39:32.330 --> 39:34.218
I JUST SAW BRANNIGAN'S
TRANSFER REQUEST.

39:34.270 --> 39:37.489
IT'S COMPLETELY FILLED OUT,
JUST AWAITING MY SIGNATURE.

39:37.540 --> 39:40.361
THAT GIRL IS GOOD AS GONZO.
- WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

39:40.410 --> 39:42.731
I HAVE TO SAY
I FEEL A LITTLE BAD ABOUT IT.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.577
- BOO-HOO.

39:44.610 --> 39:48.546
DETECTIVE BRANNIGAN!
PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS?

39:48.580 --> 39:50.639
- WELL, SIR, I KNOW
THAT I HAVE HID IT WELL,

39:50.680 --> 39:53.786
BUT, UM, THIS LAST WEEK
HAS BEEN A LITTLE HARD ON ME.

39:53.820 --> 39:56.209
- REALLY?
- YEP.

39:56.260 --> 39:58.251
WATCHING YOU FELLAS OPERATE
FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS,

39:58.290 --> 40:01.350
UH, IT'S KINDA KOOKY.

40:01.390 --> 40:04.223
AND MOST FOLKS WOULD TRY AND
HIDE THAT LEVEL OF TOMFOOLERY,

40:04.260 --> 40:06.990
BUT, UH, YOU DIDN'T.

40:10.270 --> 40:12.830
- YES. SO, UH,
I TRIED TO WORK THROUGH IT,

40:12.870 --> 40:18.172
AND, UH, TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT, UH...

40:18.210 --> 40:21.247
IT WORKS!
[laughing]

40:21.280 --> 40:25.410
FINALLY, I HAVE FOUND A PLACE
WHERE I CAN FEEL FREE

40:25.450 --> 40:28.146
TO COME OUT
AND BE MY TRUE SELF.

40:28.190 --> 40:32.581
I PLACE WHERE I DON'T HAVE
TO HIDE MY PECCADILLOES.

40:34.960 --> 40:38.327
- NO, LOOK, BRANNIGAN--

40:38.360 --> 40:40.897
THOSE ARE COLT 19115.

40:40.930 --> 40:42.158
THAT'S WHAT I CARRY.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.361
- YES,
AND I GOT NAMES FOR 'EM.

40:44.400 --> 40:48.268
THIS ONE HERE IS BELLE STARR.

40:48.310 --> 40:51.302
AND THIS LI'ITLE BEAUTY
IS BEATRIX KIDDO.

40:51.340 --> 40:53.900
[giggling]

40:53.950 --> 40:57.374
WHOA!
IT'S SO FREEING!

40:57.420 --> 40:59.183
I MEAN, I KNOW
THAT YOU PROBABLY THINK

40:59.220 --> 41:00.619
THAT I AM COMPLETELY
OBJECTIVE,

41:00.650 --> 41:03.084
BUT I'M FAR FROM IMPARTIAL.

41:03.120 --> 41:05.884
I ALWAYS ASSUME
THAT EVERYONE'S GUILTY.

41:05.930 --> 41:07.386
ALWAYS!

41:07.430 --> 41:08.897
EVEN IF A COURT FREES THEM,

41:08.930 --> 41:11.398
EVEN IF SOMEONE ELSE
CONFESSES LATER.

41:11.430 --> 41:13.762
AND AT NIGHT, BEFORE I DRIFT OFF
TO DREAMY LAND,

41:13.800 --> 41:16.030
I'VE GOT A WALL OF SUSPECT S

41:16.070 --> 41:18.504
RIGHT UP THERE
NEXT TO MY CAT PAINTINGS...

41:18.540 --> 41:20.861
BECAUSE IT CENTERS ME

41:20.910 --> 41:24.232
AND GIVES ME SWEET,
SWEET DREAMS.

41:24.280 --> 41:27.579
- BRANNIGAN,
I HAVE UNDERESTIMATED YOU...

41:27.610 --> 41:29.942
AND YOUR CHOICE IN SIDEARMS.

41:29.980 --> 41:32.881
- IT'S A HECK OF AN HONOR
TO BE ON THE TEAM, SIR.

41:32.920 --> 41:36.515
YOUR TEAM.

41:36.560 --> 41:41.327
GENTLEMEN, I AM HOME.

41:41.360 --> 41:44.056
GIMME SOME SUGAR!
- WHOA.

41:44.100 --> 41:46.660
- SUGAR...WHAT?

41:46.700 --> 41:49.362
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- MAMA--MAMA SUGAR.

41:49.400 --> 41:53.507
MAMA SUGAR.
- WHAT?

41:53.540 --> 41:55.474
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

41:55.510 --> 41:57.671
DEEP DOWN, I KNEW IT WASN'T
GONNA GET O'HARA BACK.

41:57.710 --> 41:59.439
BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

41:59.480 --> 42:01.812
I THINK BRANNIGAN
MIGHT WORK OUT.

42:01.850 --> 42:04.114
EXCUSE ME.

42:04.150 --> 42:05.742
- LASSITER HAS A CLONE.

42:05.790 --> 42:07.417
SHE MAY BE PART BANSHEE.

42:07.450 --> 42:11.056
- AND WE HAVE TO WORK
WITH THE BOTH OF THEM.

42:11.090 --> 42:13.058
- MAN.
