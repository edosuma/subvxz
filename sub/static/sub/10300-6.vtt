01:16.600 --> 01:20.036
Do we have the munchies?

01:20.240 --> 01:23.835
Well, how does a nice salami,
goat cheese...

01:24.040 --> 01:27.669
...peanut butter
and crayfish sandwich sound?

01:29.520 --> 01:33.115
Now, I wonder where we could
dig one of those up.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.274
Well, lookie here.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.230
Look out below.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.598
Something's missing.

01:53.560 --> 01:56.677
Here's your ice cream, Mom.
Tabaki and clam.

01:59.560 --> 02:02.313
That's the missing ingredient.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.949
Well, it's not for me,
it's for the baby.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.150
What's she carrying in there,
a chain-smoking otter?

02:17.080 --> 02:20.959
Damn, they always put the clams
on the bottom.

02:23.480 --> 02:27.393
Oh, Mom, we saw something very
interesting on the way home today.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.273
We saw some pregnant women
coming out of the supermarket...

02:30.480 --> 02:32.948
...and they were pushing carts
filled with that...

02:33.160 --> 02:35.674
- Oh, God, what do you call it?
- Groceries.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.757
Yeah.

02:37.960 --> 02:41.714
So we'd like to see exactly where
Dr. Spock says...

02:41.920 --> 02:45.549
...that pregnant women can't feed
anyone named Bud or Kelly.

02:46.440 --> 02:48.431
I think it's page 15.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.909
Hey, don't pull that with us.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.190
Bud can read, you know.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.756
Can't I enjoy
the motherhood experience...

02:57.960 --> 03:01.270
...without you two children
yapping at my heels?

03:01.960 --> 03:04.235
Well, I say that the born
have rights too.

03:04.440 --> 03:07.034
Bud and I are one girl
who has had enough.

03:08.560 --> 03:12.838
- Now feed us.
- All right, you little ingrates.

03:13.040 --> 03:17.158
The two of you may share a spoon
of my tabaki ice cream.

03:18.120 --> 03:21.635
Yeah, I don't want any tabaki
ice cream. I still have my pride.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.150
I'm not putting anything
that disgusting in my...

03:24.360 --> 03:26.430
Hey, dog food.

03:27.640 --> 03:31.269
I remember this brand.
It's got extra horse.

03:32.400 --> 03:36.678
- Hey, well, why isn't Buck eating any?
- He hasn't eaten for three days.

03:37.240 --> 03:39.754
The poor guy. Well, here.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.952
To your health.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.279
Harriet, Ricky, David.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.391
I have a little announcement.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.590
We're gonna have to start
tightening our belts.

04:05.800 --> 04:09.315
We can still keep the help,
can't we, Papa?

04:10.200 --> 04:14.557
Sure, just keep eating that dog food,
oblivious to the problems of the world.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.911
But from now on, I'm gonna need
every nickel we got around here.

04:18.120 --> 04:21.271
Al, you haven't said anything
to the baby.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.357
I'm sorry.

04:24.680 --> 04:26.591
Get a job.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.879
Anyway, mall employees are no longer
allowed to park in the free parking lot.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.275
I have to park on the street
two blocks away...

04:35.480 --> 04:38.199
...where the city
has thoughtfully installed...

04:38.400 --> 04:40.550
...new one-hour parking meters.

04:40.760 --> 04:44.389
Yep, I guess they figured that parking
for free and working for a shoe store...

04:44.600 --> 04:46.591
...was arousing too much jealousy.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.197
Gee, I sense a keen
"remember when" speech coming.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.676
Remember when you could park
on the street for free in this country?

04:55.880 --> 04:59.156
Am I the only one that senses that,
slowly but surely...

04:59.360 --> 05:01.430
...our freedoms
are being taken away?

05:01.640 --> 05:04.712
The freedom to park. The freedom
not to fasten your seat belt.

05:04.920 --> 05:07.798
To not have to worry
about having a working muffler.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.312
Back then,
you knew a man was coming...

05:10.520 --> 05:14.069
...by the black smoke belching
out the back of his American car...

05:14.280 --> 05:19.149
...as he tossed beer cans and
french-fry packages out the window.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.631
Now how's a man
supposed to have fun?

05:26.840 --> 05:28.956
By being with his family?

05:30.160 --> 05:32.515
I weep for this country.

05:34.160 --> 05:37.948
That's very touching, honey.
Now rub my feet.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.397
Peg, I wouldn't rub your feet
if a genie popped out of them.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.711
But be warned about this, I don't
wanna hear about anybody's problems.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.275
Nothing is going to get me
off this couch.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.914
Dad, I think Buck is sick.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.957
My baby?

05:54.840 --> 05:57.832
What's the matter
with my hairy man?

05:59.280 --> 06:00.872
We've been married for 20 years...

06:01.080 --> 06:03.958
...and that's just starting
to bother you now?

06:07.240 --> 06:09.879
I was talking about the dog,
Brunhilde.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.079
Well, what's wrong with him?

06:13.280 --> 06:15.191
I don't know,
he hasn't eaten in days.

06:15.400 --> 06:19.109
Well, I'm running low on foodstuffs,
so maybe you guys could go out...

06:19.360 --> 06:21.191
Hey, there's a new pet shop
in the mall.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.915
Why don't we go down and see if
we can get Buck a different dog food.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.873
On your way back,
could you stop at Ox Kebab...

06:28.080 --> 06:31.709
...and bring me back a John Madden
with the works.

06:32.480 --> 06:33.833
Did your mother say something?

06:34.040 --> 06:37.350
- Who knows.
- Who cares anyway. Who cares.

06:52.840 --> 06:57.789
So they have all this time for the dog
and none for me.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.833
Does that mean
I rank below an animal?

07:04.400 --> 07:08.871
Yeah. These are frail times
for us both.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.278
You know, I tell you,
by the way they act...

07:18.480 --> 07:21.631
...you'd think that we were
unpleasant to be around.

07:26.520 --> 07:30.433
By the way,
did you bring the gas tablets?

07:41.960 --> 07:45.430
Well, didn't you bring any for you?

07:45.640 --> 07:49.758
I got boxes of that stuff at home.
Jefferson eats it like candy.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.715
He's having
a sympathetic pregnancy.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.115
It's the cutest thing.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.792
Well...

08:04.160 --> 08:07.072
...nobody better pull my finger.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.476
Did you finish
painting the nursery, honey?

08:10.680 --> 08:15.356
I couldn't. Every time I'd go
up the ladder, I'd have to go pee.

08:15.560 --> 08:19.109
Then I'd sit there
and nothing would happen.

08:19.320 --> 08:23.598
Look, my feet are all swollen.
They're big as tubs.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.916
I just wanna cry.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.596
I'm just so happy.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.789
God, he's good at this.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.150
Tell me about it.
He felt his baby kick before I did.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.236
Yeah, I did.

08:39.679 --> 08:41.955
Is Al feeling anything?

08:42.159 --> 08:44.071
Well, just the pride
any man would feel...

08:44.280 --> 08:46.635
...who has to ask his son
for an allowance.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.439
My uterus hurts.

08:52.680 --> 08:55.592
Wow, he is good at this.

08:55.800 --> 09:00.510
You know, I just think it's beautiful
how your husband shares your pain.

09:03.160 --> 09:06.709
It is. He's a wonderful man.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.557
I am.

09:12.880 --> 09:16.429
Touch me, Marcie,
I wanna feel your warmth.

09:23.200 --> 09:26.670
Good news, Dad,
the D'Arcys are here.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.710
Kids, take a good long look.

09:29.920 --> 09:33.674
This is worth
a thousand condom commercials.

09:41.560 --> 09:44.358
All right, let's feed Buck,
unless they've already eaten him.

09:49.160 --> 09:51.310
- Rub my belly.
- Rub my belly.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.511
Rub my belly.

09:54.320 --> 09:57.039
Kids, don't look back.
We'll all be salt.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.438
Come on, Buck.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.076
We got you some new food.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.794
Look, cat parts.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.389
You can taste the meow.

10:14.560 --> 10:18.439
Come on, boy.
Tell Daddy what's wrong. Tell me.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.710
- AI?
- What, boy?

10:22.720 --> 10:25.188
It's me, you Milk Dud.

10:25.400 --> 10:28.790
Well, look, I wanna know right this
minute why your feet aren't swollen...

10:29.000 --> 10:32.072
...and you never complain
about your breasts.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.635
Yeah, Daddy, why?

10:36.520 --> 10:39.353
Well, Peg, if you don't have them,
they can't hurt.

10:40.160 --> 10:41.912
Tell them, Marcie.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.957
Kids, I know what will be good
for Buck:

10:50.160 --> 10:51.639
A nice ride in the fresh air.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.114
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's go.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.596
- Come on, boy.
- I'd like to go out into the fresh air.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.711
- Did your mother say something?
- Who knows.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.558
- Who cares anyway.
- Come on.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.517
Gee, what if they love Buck
more than me?

11:05.720 --> 11:07.597
Oh, well, that's just impossible.

11:08.640 --> 11:11.791
You ought to see Buck, Peg,
with his head sticking out the window...

11:12.000 --> 11:14.434
...just like you used to do.

11:18.040 --> 11:21.669
Well, I'll tell you one thing,
I'm glad he's not my husband.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.671
I know I haven't treated you
like I should...

11:28.880 --> 11:31.030
...but it doesn't mean
I don't care about you.

11:31.240 --> 11:36.234
Things will change from now on.
You know I always loved you.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.951
I don't know
what's wrong with him, Peg.

11:47.960 --> 11:51.077
Well, maybe he wants
both my pillows.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.831
Comfy, boy?

12:00.480 --> 12:02.710
You want Mommy's robe?

12:05.520 --> 12:07.795
Okay, Dad, look.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.275
We got Buck a hot-water bottle...

12:10.480 --> 12:13.040
...and some new doggy toys.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.832
Well, did you get my tushy loofa?

12:15.080 --> 12:17.640
No. Now, listen. Good news.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.910
Buck's vet says
there's nothing wrong with him.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.953
He thinks he might feel neglected
with the baby coming and all.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.878
Look, kids, let's cheer Buck up.
Get on the bed.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.433
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:31.640 --> 12:35.076
Now, let's all make funny faces
to Buck.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.077
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:38.560 --> 12:42.155
If I don't get some attention
real soon, I'm leaving.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.918
Come on, boy.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.912
Well, I mean it. I'll go.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.838
Hey, I got a good idea.

12:50.040 --> 12:53.510
Let's go downstairs and get us some
dog food, show Buck how it's done.

12:53.720 --> 12:56.075
- I like that stuff. It's good, really.
- Come on, boy.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.475
- Let's go and get some grub.
- Now, wait a minute.

12:58.920 --> 13:03.277
I need some attention. I'm pregnant.

13:04.960 --> 13:08.191
All right, fine, then I'm leaving.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.391
If you love that dog so much, just...

13:10.600 --> 13:12.830
Just go to him when you need...

13:16.240 --> 13:17.992
...to know...

13:22.640 --> 13:26.110
Oh, well, it doesn't matter,
because I'm leaving.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.639
Did Mom say something?

13:27.840 --> 13:30.434
- I don't think so.
- Mom? Who's that?

13:30.640 --> 13:34.076
And that's why I came home
to Wanker County.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.077
I'm just so happy to be here.

13:36.280 --> 13:39.238
I needed to be around
some normal people, Cousin Eb.

13:42.480 --> 13:46.678
And since when do we talk
when a man's got his bag on?

13:51.760 --> 13:54.513
Now, what were you gonna say?

13:54.720 --> 13:56.676
Well, what I wanted to say...

13:56.880 --> 14:00.953
...was that I thought a saw fly
dive right into your feedbag.

14:01.160 --> 14:04.118
What do you think
the rotten meat's in there for?

14:05.760 --> 14:09.548
In case they're not serving anything
at the embassy party you'd like.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.433
Clever bon mot, Cousin Peggy.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.797
So where's Mom?

14:16.000 --> 14:19.675
She's over at Stumptown
for the Festival of the Big'uns.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.155
- Where's Dad?
- Oh, you know your pa.

14:23.360 --> 14:26.352
We keep telling him
it's okay to come down, Ma's gone...

14:26.560 --> 14:29.870
...but he's saving all his courage
for a real run.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.752
Well, I better go say hi.

14:37.040 --> 14:41.238
I was always his favourite.
He'll be glad to see me.

14:41.440 --> 14:46.514
Hi, Dad. I'm here. It's Peggy.

14:53.240 --> 14:56.118
Well, he must have thought
you were your ma.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.550
He threw down her fork.

15:02.680 --> 15:04.750
And her knife.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.518
Well, I wanna be comforted.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.837
I had a long bus trip
and all I had to eat was my lunch...

15:10.040 --> 15:13.237
...and the lunches of the elderly
who dozed off near me.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.838
And I left home because
I just wasn't getting enough attention.

15:18.040 --> 15:21.510
So now that I'm here,
I wanna be loved.

15:22.280 --> 15:26.068
If you can do it for a hen named Charo,
you can do it for me.

15:27.080 --> 15:31.790
Listen to that tongue. You can still
shrivel a man like a three-hour bath.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.151
Well, don't fret, Cousin Peggy.
I called a family meeting.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.750
We're gonna take
good Wanker-care of you.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.753
It's Possum Boy!

15:54.760 --> 15:57.320
Oh, Possum Boy.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.388
How have you been?

15:59.600 --> 16:02.558
I got run over by one of them
new Mustang cars today.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.838
So you still like to lay down
in the roads in the afternoon?

16:08.040 --> 16:10.600
Heck, you never grow out
of that kind of stuff.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.439
I love the scent of the hot tar...

16:13.640 --> 16:16.871
...the hypnotic spell of the headlights
bearing down on me...

16:17.080 --> 16:21.358
...and the feeling of flight
when you go bouncing off that grill.

16:22.280 --> 16:25.352
I'll tell you, you city folk
can keep your Disneyland...

16:25.560 --> 16:27.676
...because there,
when the ride's over...

16:27.880 --> 16:31.270
...you don't wake up in a ditch
next to your breakfast.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.957
Only in America.

16:35.240 --> 16:37.913
Hey, it's Young Kit
and his new bride.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.237
Hi there.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.510
Cousin Effie.
Why, you got married again.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.836
That's the fifth time, isn't it?

16:48.040 --> 16:49.553
Well, they keep dying on me.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.115
That's why, this time,
I married a young'un.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.990
Come on, sweetie.

16:55.760 --> 17:00.276
Ain't he spry? He's still got
all his teeth too. Show her, honey.

17:04.280 --> 17:06.031
I may have to chew his food...

17:06.240 --> 17:10.438
...but when it comes to loving,
thank God he's got six brothers.

17:12.359 --> 17:16.114
Peggy, I hear tell
you're from the city.

17:16.319 --> 17:18.709
You got any pictures of breasts?

17:20.440 --> 17:24.672
Well, what particular species
were you looking for?

17:25.760 --> 17:30.038
Is this a family reunion
or is this a family reunion?

17:30.240 --> 17:32.595
Now, get us something to eat.

17:34.560 --> 17:37.677
Me? Well, I'm pregnant.

17:37.880 --> 17:40.314
I came down here
so you could take care of me.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.717
Well, don't you worry, Cousin Peggy,
we're gonna take care of you...

17:43.920 --> 17:46.753
...like we take care
of all our expectant women.

17:51.280 --> 17:54.033
See that, Cousin Peggy?
You're looking better already.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.548
Well, who wouldn't...

17:56.760 --> 17:59.911
...after building a table,
changing the oil in the tractor...

18:00.120 --> 18:04.033
...and listening to the old guy
pass gas to the tune of "Dixie."

18:04.360 --> 18:06.590
Now, when do I get something
to eat around here...?

18:06.800 --> 18:08.199
Hey, is that a car passing by?

18:20.920 --> 18:23.229
Gosh. Well, who was that?

18:23.480 --> 18:25.436
If we knew,
we wouldn't be shooting at him.

18:27.040 --> 18:31.591
All right, I've had just about enough.
Now, I want someone to rub my feet...

18:31.800 --> 18:36.191
...or stroke my hair, or at least give me
a stinking sympathy pain or two.

18:37.040 --> 18:39.429
Sympathy pain. Hear that, Possum?

18:39.640 --> 18:43.076
Boy, the city's taken
the Wanker out of you, cousin.

18:43.280 --> 18:47.592
That rich city man you married
has done spoiled you.

18:48.320 --> 18:51.198
That's what happens when you marry
one of them professional men.

18:51.400 --> 18:56.315
I don't care how good you are,
no man deserves $3.50 an hour.

18:56.520 --> 18:59.193
It promotes those high-toned ways.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.470
Ain't nothing but sin in the city,
anyways.

19:01.680 --> 19:04.592
I say if you're gonna gyrate naked
on tables for money...

19:04.800 --> 19:06.995
...you should do it for the family.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.393
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

19:09.600 --> 19:13.718
Now, look, I just travelled 200 miles
and 100 years back in time...

19:13.920 --> 19:15.797
...to come and be with you people.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.389
The least you can do
is give me something to eat.

19:18.600 --> 19:21.239
- How about some bacon?
- Oh, yes, please.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.874
You know where the hog pen is.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.517
Come on, Buck, open the hangar.

19:29.720 --> 19:32.598
Look, Daddy likes it.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.073
Now you try.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.514
It's no use.
I mean, it can't be the dog food.

19:44.720 --> 19:48.269
Dad's been gobbling it up for days
and he's healthier than he's ever been.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.277
Right, Dad?

19:58.920 --> 20:01.434
Well, I'm finally home.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.392
You went out today, Mom?

20:04.560 --> 20:06.391
I've been gone for a week.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.797
Didn't you get my note?
I left it on the refrigerator.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.434
Now, why would we go in there?

20:13.000 --> 20:16.549
Well, it doesn't matter.
Anyway, I learned two things.

20:16.760 --> 20:20.548
One, trying to hike your skirt up
to get a ride doesn't do much for you...

20:20.760 --> 20:22.751
...when you're six months pregnant.

20:22.960 --> 20:28.910
And two, this is where I belong,
with my family that loves me.

20:31.680 --> 20:34.319
You really didn't notice I was gone?

20:35.120 --> 20:39.272
Of course we noticed you were gone.
How could we miss you, Mom?

20:39.480 --> 20:40.708
Was she really gone?

20:44.800 --> 20:48.509
Never mind. Thanks, kids.
It's good to be home.

20:49.520 --> 20:52.751
Now, let's say we celebrate
by doing something as a family.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.838
Hey, that's a good idea.
We've been cooped up in here for days.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.838
What's say we get some fresh air?
Who'll throw me the Frisbee?

20:59.040 --> 21:00.792
- I'll throw it.
- Good.

21:02.400 --> 21:06.029
Oh, it's a happy Daddy,
it's a happy Daddy.

21:08.600 --> 21:12.912
Well, it's good to be home again
and see things are back to normal.

21:24.880 --> 21:28.350
You know, I just wish someone
around here would appreciate me...

21:28.560 --> 21:31.518
...and know what I'm going through.

21:31.720 --> 21:35.793
Just one lousy, stinking sympathy pain
would be enough.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.994
But I guess that's my fate,
to bear my burden alone.

21:41.240 --> 21:46.678
Alone? Look at these nipples.
My paws are bloated.

21:46.880 --> 21:50.668
They k eep shoving food in my face,
when all I need is a hug.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.678
God, I just wanna cry.

21:55.960 --> 21:59.714
Boy, your paws are as big as tubs.

21:59.920 --> 22:02.115
Yours too.

22:05.240 --> 22:08.152
Mom. Mom. Mom. Come quick.

22:08.360 --> 22:11.511
Dad's chasing the D'Arcys' car
down the street.
