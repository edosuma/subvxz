22:10.913 --> 22:11.949
Right, Baby?

22:12.039 --> 22:14.247
Ugh! Don't touch, for God sakes.
I'm late already.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.074
What time is it?

22:16.168 --> 22:17.704
Oh, my God!

22:19.004 --> 22:20.916
Straighten out the bed for me, will ya, Tex.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.419
Say, Cass.

22:25.094 --> 22:27.006
I sure have enjoyed bein' here.

22:27.930 --> 22:31.423
I believe it's as fine a time
as I've ever had in my damn life.

22:31.517 --> 22:32.928
Me too, lover.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.930
Well, that's good. It is, 'cause, uh...

22:35.020 --> 22:37.808
Well, hell, the way you make me
feel so damn at home here,

22:37.898 --> 22:40.140
I almost hate to bring up business.

22:40.234 --> 22:43.352
Yeah, it's murder, isn't it?
What line are you in, sweetie?

22:43.445 --> 22:45.357
Zip me up, will ya, Tex?

22:45.447 --> 22:48.440
Maury's always
complaining about his ulcers.

22:49.243 --> 22:51.326
Yeah, well, I don't know
what line Maury's in,

22:51.412 --> 22:55.577
but, uh, myself, now,
I'm, uh, kinda a hustler.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.373
Well, a person's gotta make a living.

22:58.252 --> 22:59.538
Uh, pardon me, ma'am?

23:00.754 --> 23:02.666
I said, "A person's gotta make a living."

23:03.924 --> 23:06.007
Are you sure you heard what I said?

23:06.093 --> 23:08.130
Sorry, Tex. My mind isn't all here.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.303
I don't wanna be late
for my date with Maury.

23:10.389 --> 23:13.803
Listen, sweetie, why don't you
run along and, um, take the number.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.931
And we're gonna get in touch
with each other real soon. Aren't we?

23:18.147 --> 23:19.604
Would you believe that?

23:19.690 --> 23:22.057
I forgot to get to the bank,
and now it's too late.

23:22.151 --> 23:25.235
Listen, I have to take a taxi.
I need a few bucks.

23:25.321 --> 23:28.439
I hate to ask you, but you're such a doll.

23:29.867 --> 23:33.156
You know, Cass, that's a funny thing,
you mentioning money,

23:33.245 --> 23:36.329
'cause I was just about to ask <i>you</i> for some.

23:36.415 --> 23:39.783
You were gonna ask me for money? Huh?

23:39.877 --> 23:43.086
Well, hell, why do you think I come
all the way up here from Texas for?

23:43.172 --> 23:45.755
You were gonna ask me for money.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.962
Who the hell do you think
you're dealing with?

23:49.053 --> 23:51.841
Some old slut on 42nd Street?

23:51.931 --> 23:54.639
In case you didn't happen to notice it,

23:54.725 --> 23:56.887
you big Texas longhorn bull,

23:56.977 --> 23:58.889
I'm one hell of a gorgeous chick!

23:58.979 --> 24:01.687
- Well, now, Cass, take it easy now.
- You heard it. At 28 years old.

24:01.774 --> 24:05.063
You think you can come up here
and pull this kind of crap up here?

24:05.152 --> 24:07.690
- Well, you're out of your mind!
- Cass, now, come on now.

24:07.780 --> 24:11.148
I could kill you with my bare hands!
Will ya get outta here!

24:11.241 --> 24:14.325
Will you get outta here!

24:15.496 --> 24:17.112
Oh, Cass, honey.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.948
Cass, come on now.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.036
Cass... Hey, Cass. You think I meant that?

24:24.129 --> 24:29.045
Would I be after you for money
with a wad like I've got ridin' on my hip?

24:29.134 --> 24:32.047
Now, come on. You stop your cryin'.
You are one gorgeous chick.

24:32.137 --> 24:35.596
Guy gets horny just lookin' at you.
How much you want for that damn taxi?

24:35.683 --> 24:37.675
How much you want now? Five?

24:39.478 --> 24:40.969
Ten? You want ten?

24:44.233 --> 24:45.644
Twenty?

24:47.403 --> 24:49.144
There you go, girl.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.389
Terrific shirt.

25:26.942 --> 25:30.561
- Are you speakin' to me?
- I was just admiring that colossal shirt.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.771
I mean, that is one hell of a shirt.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.152
I'll bet you paid a pretty price for it.
Am I right?

25:35.242 --> 25:37.655
- Oh, I ain't cheap.
- Yeah. Birds.

25:37.745 --> 25:40.988
- I say it's an all-right shirt.
- I like birds.

25:41.081 --> 25:44.620
I don't like to have a lot of, you know,
cheap stuff on my back.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.622
- Sure.
- Hi, cowboy.

25:46.712 --> 25:47.953
Got a cigarette?

25:48.756 --> 25:50.418
Hey, sweetheart.

25:51.967 --> 25:54.300
More goddamn faggots in this town.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.594
- Oh, kiss it, Ratso!
- Up yours.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.093
You gotta watch out for that.

25:59.183 --> 26:03.348
Hey, you really know the ropes.
Damn. I wish I'd bumped into you before.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.305
I'm Joe Buck from Texas.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.140
Enrico Rizzo, from the Bronx.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.897
And I'm gonna buy you a drink.
What the hell you think of that?

26:11.987 --> 26:15.025
- Don't mind if I do.
- Bartender, drinks all around.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.947
And one for my friend here too.

26:17.659 --> 26:20.823
I know when I give satisfaction.
I give her satisfaction.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.496
I mean, you see what I'm getting at here?

26:23.582 --> 26:25.665
She's got a penthouse up there

26:25.751 --> 26:28.960
with a color TV and more goddamn diamonds
than an archbishop.

26:29.046 --> 26:31.379
And she busts out bawlin'
when I ask her for money.

26:31.465 --> 26:33.752
- For what?
- For money.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.799
Wait a minute. Money for what?

26:36.428 --> 26:39.296
Well, hell, I'm a hustler.
You didn't know that?

26:40.808 --> 26:43.551
How am I supposed to know that?
You gotta tell a person these things.

26:43.644 --> 26:45.556
- I'm a hustler.
- Shh.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.937
All right. You're a hustler.

26:50.400 --> 26:54.565
But, I mean, your pickin' up trade
on the street like that, that's nowhere.

26:54.655 --> 26:57.272
I mean, you gotta get yourself
some kind of management.

26:58.492 --> 27:00.279
I think you put your finger on it.

27:00.369 --> 27:02.361
You know what you need?

27:02.454 --> 27:04.411
You need my friend O'Daniel.

27:04.498 --> 27:06.706
He operates the biggest stable in town.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.284
In fact, in the whole
goddamn metropolitan area.

27:09.378 --> 27:11.290
It's stupid, a stud like you paying.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.588
You don't wanna be stupid.
I mean, I understand.

27:13.674 --> 27:16.257
A dame starts cryin',
I'd cut my heart out for her.

27:16.343 --> 27:19.177
I'd call that a very minor operation.

27:19.263 --> 27:21.676
In fact, you just sit comfy

27:21.765 --> 27:24.849
and I'll cut it out
with my fingernail file, Ratso.

27:24.935 --> 27:25.800
The name's Rizzo.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.851
That's what I said. Ratso.

27:27.938 --> 27:30.476
- Hey. You heard him.
- That's all right, Joe.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.024
I mean, you know, I'm used to these types

27:33.110 --> 27:35.067
that get their kicks pickin' on cripples.

27:35.154 --> 27:38.113
- The sewer's full of them.
- I wanna ask you one question, cowboy.

27:39.116 --> 27:41.859
If you're sitting over here,
and he's sitting all the way over there,

27:41.952 --> 27:43.944
then how's he gonna get his hand
into your pocket?

27:44.037 --> 27:48.031
- Well, suppose you let me work...
- Oh, but I guess he's got that all figured out.

27:48.125 --> 27:49.707
Good night, sweets.

27:50.794 --> 27:51.705
Faggot.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.286
- Provolone.
- Faggot.

27:53.380 --> 27:56.043
Look, with these gals that wanna buy it,

27:56.133 --> 27:58.671
most of them are old and dignified.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.127
Social register types.
You know what I mean?

28:01.221 --> 28:04.885
They can't be trottin' down to Times Square
to pick out the merchandise.

28:04.975 --> 28:07.718
They gotta have some kind of a middleman.

28:07.811 --> 28:10.554
That's where O'Daniel comes in.
You know what I mean?

28:10.647 --> 28:13.731
Hey, I'm walkin' here!

28:13.817 --> 28:15.809
I'm walkin' here!

28:15.903 --> 28:17.519
- Up yours, you son of a bitch!
- Get out of the way!

28:17.613 --> 28:19.696
You don't talk to me that way!
Get outta here!

28:23.911 --> 28:25.368
Don't worry about that.

28:25.454 --> 28:28.197
Actually, that ain't a bad way
to pick up insurance.

28:28.290 --> 28:33.251
It's crazy, a stud like you paying that
dame that you told me about double sawbucks.

28:33.337 --> 28:35.044
You know, with proper management,

28:35.130 --> 28:38.669
you could be takin' home $50,
maybe $100 a day, easy.

28:38.759 --> 28:41.672
Hey, Brucie. Hang in there, baby.

28:42.429 --> 28:43.465
What's that?

28:44.681 --> 28:47.594
Him I placed with O'Daniel
about two weeks ago.

28:47.684 --> 28:50.017
He ain't much of a stud either,
from what I hear.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.236
All right, all right.

29:00.322 --> 29:01.563
Hey, horse.

29:01.657 --> 29:04.400
How about you take me to meet
this Mr. O'Diddleburg right now?

29:04.493 --> 29:07.110
- What do you say about that?
- Well, Joe, you're a nice guy.

29:07.204 --> 29:10.868
And I'd be doin' both of youse a favor.
But, you know, for what?

29:10.958 --> 29:14.292
What am I draggin' my bum leg
around town for, you know?

29:14.378 --> 29:18.463
Tomorrow, some peach like that is liable to be
scratching your back over there at the Plaza.

29:18.548 --> 29:20.540
And where am I gonna be, you know? Where?

29:20.634 --> 29:24.753
H-Hold on. Hold it right there.
You think I'm that kind of a son of a bitch?

29:24.846 --> 29:26.758
Well, you just name your cut.

29:26.848 --> 29:29.306
Whatever you want, you got it right now.
I swear.

29:29.393 --> 29:30.554
It's all right.

29:30.644 --> 29:32.556
What you want? Five? Ten?

29:32.646 --> 29:36.139
What, are you kidding me?
You know what? I'd "ax" somebody else.

29:36.233 --> 29:39.647
- There's ten right there.
- All right, all right. Forget it.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.477
I'll take the ten.

29:41.571 --> 29:43.813
But when I take you over
to see Mr. O'Daniel,

29:43.907 --> 29:47.275
I'm gonna have to have another ten
just to cover expenses. All right?

29:47.369 --> 29:48.655
- Uh...
- Come on.

29:48.745 --> 29:51.032
I'll buy youse coffee. On me.

29:52.165 --> 29:55.749
Get outta here. Come on.
Bunch of creeps. Go to work.

29:58.505 --> 30:01.339
He needs you right now. Tonight.

30:01.425 --> 30:03.542
I got his tongue hangin' out.

30:03.635 --> 30:06.673
He... His name is Joe Buck.
He's a cowboy.

30:06.763 --> 30:09.801
He just, uh... Just came in from Texas.
He, uh... Very new to the city.

30:09.891 --> 30:11.427
He don't quite know the ropes.

30:11.518 --> 30:14.477
But he's very promising material, sir,
if you know what I mean.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.563
<i>Fabulous. Right away.</i>

30:17.649 --> 30:20.437
<i>What's your, uh, room
number there again, sir?</i>

30:21.111 --> 30:22.443
<i>Right. Okay.</i>

30:27.451 --> 30:30.194
901. You got it?
Hey, hold it a second, will ya?

30:31.204 --> 30:33.196
Let's see how you look.

30:34.291 --> 30:35.782
Fine. Fine.

30:35.876 --> 30:37.287
You look fine.

30:37.377 --> 30:40.336
Uh, think I could have that other ten now?

30:41.882 --> 30:43.373
Where can I reach you?

30:43.467 --> 30:46.084
'Cause I'm gon' make this thing right
with you soon as I get me set up.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.636
- Forget it.
- I mean it, damn it. Where do you live?

30:48.722 --> 30:50.884
Uh, it's the Sherry-Netherlands Hotel.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.432
Chevy-Netherlands Hotel.
Chevy-Netherlands Hotel.

30:53.518 --> 30:56.386
Hurry up now. Get your ass in there.
He's waitin'. Go ahead.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.346
Come on. What, are you on vacation?

30:58.440 --> 31:01.899
Don't close the doors on me.
What's the matter with you?

31:13.997 --> 31:15.829
You must be Joe Buck.

31:15.916 --> 31:17.578
Yes, sir, I am.

31:17.667 --> 31:19.659
Come on in. Let's take a look at you.

31:27.844 --> 31:30.382
Turn round. Turn round.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.641
Good, strong back.
You're gonna need it.

31:36.937 --> 31:38.178
Yeah.

31:38.271 --> 31:40.684
So you want help, eh?

31:40.774 --> 31:42.936
Yeah. Sit down, sit down. Relax.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.268
Yeah.

31:49.699 --> 31:50.985
Cowboy, eh?

31:52.202 --> 31:55.946
Uh, w-well, sir, I... I
ain't a for-real cowboy.

31:56.039 --> 31:58.998
But I am one hell of a stud!

31:59.084 --> 32:00.541
Take it easy, boy.

32:02.087 --> 32:06.252
Seems to me you're different
from most of the boys that come to me.

32:06.341 --> 32:09.300
Most of those boys
are troubled and confused.

32:10.429 --> 32:13.467
I'd say you know exactly what you want.

32:13.557 --> 32:15.799
- You bet I do, sir.
- Yeah.

32:18.562 --> 32:21.851
But I'll bet you got one thing in common
with those other boys.

32:22.816 --> 32:24.603
I'll bet you're lonesome.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.065
Well, not too.

32:30.532 --> 32:31.773
I mean, a little.

32:31.867 --> 32:33.779
Yeah.

32:33.869 --> 32:35.656
Lonesome!

32:36.455 --> 32:39.744
"I'm lonesome, so I'm a drunk."

32:39.833 --> 32:42.576
- "I'm lonesome, so I'm a dope fiend."
- Oh, shut up!

32:42.669 --> 32:44.661
"I'm lonesome, so I'm a thief."

32:44.754 --> 32:47.121
"I'm lonesome, so I'm a fornicator!"

32:47.215 --> 32:48.831
- "A whoremonger!"
- Shut up, you phony!

32:48.925 --> 32:50.712
Poop, I say! Poop!

32:50.802 --> 32:52.384
I've heard it all.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.555
I've heard it all, and I'm sick of it.
Sick to death of it!

32:55.640 --> 32:58.257
- Yes, sir, I can see that.
- Lonesomeness.

32:59.728 --> 33:02.436
Lonesomeness is something
you take, you hear?

33:02.522 --> 33:05.265
Damn it, you take it
and you go right on with your work.

33:05.358 --> 33:08.226
- I'm rarin' to go, sir.
- Yes, I believe you are.

33:09.362 --> 33:11.274
- Cowboy, eh?
- Yes, sir.

33:11.364 --> 33:13.731
Yeah. Ready for some hard work, son?

33:13.825 --> 33:15.691
- I'm ready for anything.
- Yeah.

33:15.785 --> 33:19.699
I reckon it's gonna be a lot easier
for you, Joe Buck, than for most others.

33:19.789 --> 33:23.078
- It's gonna be like money from home, sir.
- Money from home!

33:23.168 --> 33:25.535
There's your strength, son. See?

33:25.629 --> 33:29.168
You've got the way of putting things earthy
so that anybody can understand them.

33:29.966 --> 33:32.709
I warn you, Joe Buck. I'm gonna use you.

33:33.637 --> 33:35.378
I'm gonna run you ragged!

33:35.472 --> 33:37.930
Whoo-hah!

33:38.016 --> 33:41.225
You're wonderful, boy.
You and me, we're gonna have fun together.

33:41.311 --> 33:44.224
- It don't have to be joyless.
- Hell, no, it don't have to be.

33:44.898 --> 33:47.857
Say, why don't you and me

33:47.943 --> 33:50.936
get right down on our knees right now?

33:51.613 --> 33:53.320
How's that strike you?

33:54.407 --> 33:56.319
- Where?
- Right here!

33:56.409 --> 33:57.866
Here! Here!

33:57.953 --> 33:59.239
Right now!

33:59.329 --> 34:01.992
Why not? Why not?

34:02.082 --> 34:05.701
I've prayed on the streets.
I've prayed in the saloons.

34:05.794 --> 34:07.410
I've prayed in the toilets.

34:07.504 --> 34:10.963
It don't matter where,
so long as he gets that prayer!

34:11.049 --> 34:13.085
Shit!

34:13.176 --> 34:15.168
Aah! That's the ticket, boy!

34:15.262 --> 34:17.299
Just open your heart a little more!

34:17.389 --> 34:20.097
What's the matter,
as long as you get that love...

34:20.183 --> 34:22.049
Don't be frightened, son!

34:22.143 --> 34:25.386
I baptize thee, my brother,
in the name of the Father...

34:25.480 --> 34:27.312
And you shall be heard!

34:27.399 --> 34:30.608
- <i>the Son and the Holy Spirit.
- Don't be frightened, son!</i>

34:30.694 --> 34:34.152
<i>No! Don't run from Jesus!</i>

35:33.632 --> 35:37.251
Hey. You know that runty little bastard
I was with?

35:37.344 --> 35:38.710
No, I don't know nothing, man.

35:45.268 --> 35:46.930
Stop it!

35:48.146 --> 35:51.139
Stop it! Stop it, stop it, stop it!

36:02.702 --> 36:06.070
<i>Now, what's that monstrosity down there?</i>

36:06.164 --> 36:07.746
<i>That's a toupee for dogs.</i>

36:07.832 --> 36:09.994
<i>- For dogs?
- This is Fifi's wig.</i>

36:10.085 --> 36:12.418
That... That's for that dog?

36:14.422 --> 36:17.881
<i>I don't believe this dog.
There's something going on here.</i>

36:17.967 --> 36:19.583
<i>There's something going on here.</i>

36:19.678 --> 36:21.465
<i>Now, really, seriously,</i>

36:21.554 --> 36:26.140
<i>isn't this really a case of conning
a lot of lonely people?</i>

36:26.226 --> 36:28.434
<i>Well, lonely people, yes.
Who else would do it?</i>

36:28.520 --> 36:30.512
<i>A woman with a lot of children
wouldn't have time.</i>

36:30.605 --> 36:33.564
<i>When they have no children,
a woman who is alone...</i>

36:33.650 --> 36:35.607
There's a TV dinner in the fridge, lover boy.

36:35.694 --> 36:38.607
Expect me when you see me.
I'll leave you movie money.

36:40.532 --> 36:45.448
<i>I think that's sick.
Dressing up a dog to look like a child?</i>

36:46.454 --> 36:50.994
- <i>This is in case she meets another...
- Oh, no! That's terrible!</i>

36:51.084 --> 36:52.416
<i>That's terrible!</i>

36:56.005 --> 36:57.587
<i>Trying to hold this...</i>

37:24.576 --> 37:27.819
<i>Gold and silver and candlelight.</i>

37:27.912 --> 37:30.245
<i>Wine and skyrockets</i>

37:30.331 --> 37:33.699
<i>and butterfly thoughts
that glitter in your mind.</i>

37:35.879 --> 37:37.620
<i>You're special.</i>

37:37.714 --> 37:39.922
<i>Give yourselfspecial treatment.</i>

37:41.342 --> 37:44.801
<i>Need money? We'd love to lend it to you.</i>

37:45.847 --> 37:48.055
<i>Why worry about your future?</i>

37:48.141 --> 37:51.509
<i>What do you want
more than anything in the world?</i>

37:51.603 --> 37:53.640
<i>Take it easy, but take it.</i>

38:02.363 --> 38:04.355
Key to room 514, please, sir.

38:13.958 --> 38:17.702
Looks like, uh, you've been
locked out of your room, buddy.

38:17.796 --> 38:21.164
- Till you pick up the tab.
- Well, what about all my things and all?

38:21.257 --> 38:25.627
Oh, we keep them nice and safe
till you get this thing settled.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.382
Listen, I'll tell you what.

38:27.472 --> 38:30.931
You can keep all the rest of the goddamn junk
if you just let me have the suitcase.

38:31.017 --> 38:32.633
Suitcase means a lot to me.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.969
We keep everything. House rules.

40:37.477 --> 40:39.639
I spilled some on my pants.

40:48.363 --> 40:50.776
Can you tell me
how I get to Grand Central?

40:50.865 --> 40:52.777
Surely. You follow the green lights.

40:54.118 --> 40:58.488
Uh, Officer.
How do I get to Grand Central?

41:08.925 --> 41:11.338
You know what you gotta do, cowboy?

41:49.882 --> 41:53.000
<i>Spacecraft to Earth Control.
Check trajectory.</i>

41:53.094 --> 41:57.304
<i>We have a malfunction of our instruments.
Captain Grace is investigating.</i>

<i>Orbital module has failed to separate

<i>Earth Control to spacecraft.</i>

<i>You have 30 seconds
before you are ejected into lunar trajectory.</i>

42:11.696 --> 42:14.404
<i>Only 30 seconds. Do you read me?</i>

42:17.785 --> 42:19.947
<i>Spacecraft to Earth Control. I read you.</i>

42:35.928 --> 42:38.420
<i>Chuck! Chuck! I've lost you!</i>

42:38.514 --> 42:40.597
<i>Spacecraft to Earth Control.</i>

42:40.683 --> 42:42.640
<i>We've lost contact with Captain Grace.</i>

42:42.727 --> 42:45.595
<i>- Can you track him?
- Kiss me, Joe. Kiss me.</i>

42:45.688 --> 42:47.975
<i>Earth Control to spacecraft.
He's in free fall.</i>

42:48.066 --> 42:49.773
<i>Keep trying to make contact.</i>

42:54.530 --> 42:57.739
<i>You're the only one, Joe.
You're the only one.</i>

42:57.825 --> 43:03.742
<i>Listen, kissin' Crazy Annie,
man, you better drink a whole damn drugstore.</i>

43:08.795 --> 43:11.003
<i>Kiss me, Joe. Kiss me.</i>

43:17.136 --> 43:20.095
Oh! You're the only one, Joe!

43:29.982 --> 43:33.521
I'm awful damn sorry you're sick.

43:35.071 --> 43:37.905
But you're gonna have to give me that money,
like you said.

43:40.201 --> 43:43.239
I was lying. I don't have it.

43:43.329 --> 43:45.366
What are you gonna do to me?

43:45.456 --> 43:48.415
- You ain't got no $25 on you?
- No.

43:49.502 --> 43:51.710
What are you gonna do to me?

43:51.796 --> 43:54.209
Well, what in the hell do you think
I'm gonna do?

43:54.298 --> 43:57.006
What do you want me to do with you, boy?
You want me to beat on you?

43:57.093 --> 43:58.925
- Is that what you want?
- No. No. No.

43:59.011 --> 44:00.968
- How much you got in your pockets?
- Nothing.

44:01.055 --> 44:03.798
You're gonna empty your pockets out
right over there.

44:07.645 --> 44:10.262
- Take my books.
- I don't want your damn books!

44:10.356 --> 44:11.847
- How much is that thing worth?
- No. No.

44:11.941 --> 44:14.854
Don't... Don't take my watch. Please.

44:14.944 --> 44:18.483
Don't take it. Don't take it.
It's only a cheap watch. I...

44:18.573 --> 44:21.657
It's not worth anything.
I can't go home without it either. Please.

44:22.368 --> 44:24.610
My mother would die. Don't take it.

44:24.704 --> 44:27.117
I can't go home. She'd die.

44:28.749 --> 44:31.412
She would die. Please.

44:36.382 --> 44:38.374
I don't want your damn watch.

45:15.421 --> 45:19.040

- All right. All right. Here.

45:59.257 --> 46:01.169
Come on. I want you to have it.

46:01.259 --> 46:03.421
It's sticky. What'd you do, slobber on it?

46:03.511 --> 46:05.628
- Here. Here. Have a cigarette.
- I don't wanna touch it.

46:06.389 --> 46:07.800
Come on.

46:09.433 --> 46:10.924
Come on.

46:16.732 --> 46:18.189
Come on. Sit down.

How do you like that O'Daniel,
flippin' out like that?

46:25.616 --> 46:29.986
I tried to get in touch with you when I
heard, but I was laid up with this cold.

46:34.583 --> 46:37.417
Hey, you want some free medical advice?

46:37.503 --> 46:40.166
You just keep your damn mouth shut
about that night.

46:40.256 --> 46:41.463
Right. Fine. Okay.

46:41.549 --> 46:44.508
Fine. Okay. Another subject.

46:44.593 --> 46:47.210
Where you livin' at?
You still at the hotel?

46:49.098 --> 46:51.590
What am I doin', talkin' to you, damn it?

46:53.769 --> 46:55.101
Hey, come on!

46:56.939 --> 47:00.353
- Hey! Hey, wait up, for Christ's sake!
- You keep away from me! You hear?

47:00.443 --> 47:03.186
You come near me again,
I'm gonna snatch you bald-headed, boy.

47:03.279 --> 47:06.772
I'm invitin' you.
If you're not located, I got a place.

47:07.950 --> 47:11.159
- I'm invitin' you, goddamn it!
- You're inviting. Shit!

47:13.956 --> 47:16.369
The "X" on the windows
means the landlord can't collect rent,

47:16.459 --> 47:18.826
which is a convenience
on account of it's condemned.

47:21.630 --> 47:25.044
Front door. I don't care.
Actually, I prefer it that way.

47:25.134 --> 47:27.592
Keeps the punks and the creeps outta here.

47:33.351 --> 47:35.343
Got my own private entrance here.

47:36.062 --> 47:38.395
You're the only one who knows about it.

47:41.817 --> 47:45.481
Watch the plank, watch the plank.
You'll break your goddamn skull.

47:45.571 --> 47:47.483
No way to collect insurance.

47:49.658 --> 47:51.274
Okay, okay, okay.

47:54.747 --> 47:56.238
Oh, there's glass there.

47:58.667 --> 48:01.034
Oh, I've been meaning to take that fridge up.

48:01.128 --> 48:02.539
Get it, will you?

48:04.131 --> 48:07.295
- Need any help?
- No, I don't need no help from you.

48:09.512 --> 48:10.719
You okay?

48:11.806 --> 48:13.217
It's not far.

48:15.559 --> 48:17.516
It's just one more up.

48:17.603 --> 48:20.516
All the electric's off.
I don't mess with Con Edison.

48:20.606 --> 48:22.438
Just another convenience, huh?

48:22.525 --> 48:25.438
But the icebox will keep the roaches
from gettin' in the perishables.

48:25.528 --> 48:27.986
Where did you steal this damn thing?

48:28.072 --> 48:30.780
What do you mean, steal it?
It's been sittin' down there for weeks.

48:30.866 --> 48:34.530
- I don't mean now. I mean before then.
- Don't get a hernia. You know what I mean?

48:41.752 --> 48:43.869
Go ahead. Just drop it anywhere.

48:52.888 --> 48:54.845
Not, uh... Not bad, huh?

49:04.275 --> 49:06.392
There's no heat here, but, uh, you know,

49:06.485 --> 49:09.694
by the time winter comes,
uh, I'll be in Florida.

49:10.406 --> 49:12.398
Hey, uh, do you want to stretch out here?

49:14.660 --> 49:16.652
Make yourself comfortable?

49:22.543 --> 49:23.533
Okay...

49:25.171 --> 49:28.335
Go ahead.
Why don't you take a... take a nap?

49:42.563 --> 49:44.646
Would you like a cup of coffee?

50:11.634 --> 50:14.342
Joe? Do you love me, Joe?

50:21.769 --> 50:25.262
You're the only one, Joe.
You're the only one.

50:38.744 --> 50:41.077
<i>Charlie, don't you think she's pretty?</i>

50:49.338 --> 50:51.625
<i>Charlie, don't you think she's pretty?</i>

50:51.715 --> 50:52.796
<i>Charlie...</i>

50:55.052 --> 50:57.169
<i>Charlie, do you hear me?</i>

50:57.263 --> 51:00.677
<i>I said stop that!</i>

51:09.942 --> 51:12.605
He's the one. He's the only one.

51:23.956 --> 51:25.993
<i>He's the one.</i>

51:26.083 --> 51:28.166
<i>He's the only one.</i>

51:44.143 --> 51:46.601
<i>Casualty reports have been issued.</i>

51:46.687 --> 51:50.647
<i>The American information officer says
there have been 429 American casualties.</i>

51:50.733 --> 51:52.725
<i>429 on the death list.</i>

51:52.818 --> 51:56.482
<i>This as opposed to 643
South Vietnamese soldiers on the death list.</i>

51:56.572 --> 51:58.359
Wait a minute. Hey, what...

51:58.449 --> 51:59.906
What's the mat...

51:59.992 --> 52:01.654
What's the matter?

52:03.329 --> 52:05.787
Where's my boots? Where's my damn boots?

52:08.500 --> 52:10.082
Over there.

52:14.214 --> 52:16.126
How'd they get off me?

52:16.216 --> 52:18.128
I took 'em off.

52:19.887 --> 52:21.344
Wh-What for?

52:21.430 --> 52:24.969
What do you mean, what for?
So you could sleep. I mean, Christ.

52:29.313 --> 52:31.646
Smart thing for me to do is
haul my ass outta here.

52:33.525 --> 52:34.686
What's the matter now?

52:35.569 --> 52:39.028
Well, y-you want me to stay here.
You're after somethin'. What you after?

52:42.910 --> 52:46.369
- You don't look like no fag.
- What's that supposed to mean?

52:47.956 --> 52:50.323
Want me to stay here tonight.
That's the idea, ain't it?

52:50.417 --> 52:53.376
Look, I'm not forcing you.
I mean, who's forcing you?

52:53.462 --> 52:57.422
Oh, I'm sorry. I truly am.
I must've got the wrong impression then.

52:59.510 --> 53:01.593
Okay. Okay, boy.

53:06.392 --> 53:08.429
Look, I want you to stay, all right?

53:08.519 --> 53:10.511
I goddamn invited you, didn't I?

53:14.692 --> 53:16.900
Well, I hope you know what you're in for.

53:16.985 --> 53:19.477
I'm a truly dangerous person. I am.

53:19.571 --> 53:21.938
If someone does me bad like you...

53:22.032 --> 53:25.321
If I'd have caught you that night, there
would've been one dead Ratso long about now.

53:25.411 --> 53:27.152
You understand me?

53:28.163 --> 53:29.699
You hear?

53:29.790 --> 53:31.201
I'm impressed. You're a killer.

53:34.878 --> 53:38.497
So, if I'm gonna stay here a couple days,
I just thought you should know. That's all.

53:50.644 --> 53:52.556
"Property of the YMCA."

53:53.522 --> 53:55.855
Sometimes you make me wanna puke, Ratso.

54:01.530 --> 54:03.692
Joe, uh, do me one favor, huh?

54:07.035 --> 54:10.153
- This is my place. Am I wrong?
- No, you ain't wrong.

54:11.165 --> 54:15.205
You know, in my own place,
my name ain't Ratso.

54:16.628 --> 54:20.121
I mean, it just so happens
that in my own place, my name...

54:20.215 --> 54:22.628
is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.

54:23.927 --> 54:26.089
Well, hell, I can't say all that.

54:28.140 --> 54:29.381
Rico, then.

54:30.601 --> 54:33.093
At least call me Rico
in my own goddamn place.

54:33.187 --> 54:35.554
Okay. Rico, Rico, Rico.

54:35.647 --> 54:38.185
Rico, Rico, Rico, Rico.
Is that enough for you?

54:38.275 --> 54:40.767
That's fine. Give me a pillow.

54:40.861 --> 54:42.727
Come on. Give me one of those pillows.

54:51.455 --> 54:53.492
Keep your meat hooks off my radio.

55:00.297 --> 55:01.708
Rico, Rico.

55:19.483 --> 55:20.974
Are you here again?

55:21.068 --> 55:23.435
Didn't I tell you once before
to keep away from here?

55:23.529 --> 55:25.566
- Easy, easy.
- Every time you take stuff from me!

55:25.656 --> 55:28.148
- Will you get out of here!
- That ain't nice, pickin' on a crippled boy!

55:28.242 --> 55:32.486
- Ah, cripple or not, I don't care!
- Who the hell do you think <i>you</i> are, goddamn it?

55:43.048 --> 55:46.837
The two basic items
necessary to sustain life

55:46.927 --> 55:50.091
are sunshine and coconut milk.

55:51.515 --> 55:53.427
Did you know that?

55:53.517 --> 55:55.224
That's a fact.

55:55.310 --> 55:58.724
In Florida, you got a terrific
amount of coconut trees there.

55:58.814 --> 56:02.478
In fact, I think they even got 'em
in the, uh, gas stations over there.

56:03.485 --> 56:04.896
And ladies.

56:05.779 --> 56:08.567
You know that in Miami you got, uh...

56:08.657 --> 56:10.148
Are you listenin' to me?

56:11.201 --> 56:13.534
You got more ladies in Miami

56:13.620 --> 56:16.408
than in any resort area
in the country there.

56:16.498 --> 56:21.209
I think per capita, on a given day,
there's probably 300 of 'em on the beach.

56:22.504 --> 56:24.416
In fact, you can't even scratch yourself

56:24.506 --> 56:27.374
without getting a belly button
up the old kazoo there.

56:27.467 --> 56:29.174
It's hot. Let's go.

56:30.012 --> 56:31.378
Come on!

56:41.064 --> 56:42.225
Hey.

56:44.693 --> 56:46.730
Smells worse hot than it did cold.

56:47.571 --> 56:50.484
All right, startin' tomorrow,
you cook your own goddamn dinner.

56:50.574 --> 56:53.362
Or you get one of your rich
Park Avenue ladies to cook for you.

56:53.452 --> 56:55.660
- I'm eatin' it. I'm eatin' it, see?
- In her penthouse.

56:55.746 --> 56:59.114
Look, I'm eatin' this shit, Ratso.
Mmm, good! Mmm.

57:06.840 --> 57:09.173
- It's good.
- I gotta get outta here.

57:10.469 --> 57:12.301
I gotta get outta here.

57:25.275 --> 57:27.517
Miami Beach. That's where you could score.

57:27.611 --> 57:29.944
Anybody can score there, even you.

57:31.323 --> 57:35.943
In New York, no rich lady with any class
at all buys that cowboy crap anymore.

57:36.036 --> 57:38.198
They're laughin' at you on the street.

57:39.331 --> 57:41.197
Ain't nobody laughin' at me on the street.

57:41.291 --> 57:44.159
Behind your back,
I seen 'em laughin' at you, fella.

57:44.252 --> 57:46.164
Oh, what the hell do you know
about women anyway?

57:46.254 --> 57:48.746
When's the last time you scored, boy?

57:48.840 --> 57:50.923
That's a matter
I only talk about at confession.

57:51.510 --> 57:53.217
We're not talkin' about me now.

57:53.303 --> 57:55.465
Well, when was the last time
you been to confession?

57:55.555 --> 57:58.548
That's between me and my confessor.
And I'll tell you another thing.

57:58.642 --> 58:00.759
Frankly, you're beginning to smell.

58:01.436 --> 58:03.223
And for a stud in New York,
that's a handicap.

58:03.313 --> 58:05.054
Don't talk to me about clean.

58:05.148 --> 58:08.641
I ain't never seen you change your underwear
once the whole time I've been here in New York.

58:08.735 --> 58:11.694
- And that's pretty peculiar behavior.
- I don't have to do that kind of thing in public.

58:11.780 --> 58:14.864
- I ain't got no need to expose myself.
- No, I'll bet you don't!

58:14.950 --> 58:18.068
I bet you ain't never even been laid!
How 'bout that?

58:18.161 --> 58:20.153
And <i>you're</i> gonna tell <i>me</i>
what appeals to women.

58:20.247 --> 58:23.081
I know enough to know that
that great big dumb cowboy crap of yours

58:23.166 --> 58:27.080
don't appeal to nobody
except every jacky on 42nd Street!

58:27.796 --> 58:29.412
That's faggot stuff!

58:30.048 --> 58:32.882
You wanna call it by its name,
that's strictly for fags.

58:34.136 --> 58:37.629
John Wayne!
Are you gonna tell me he's a fag?

58:54.406 --> 58:58.241
I like the way I look.
It makes me feel good. It does.

59:00.203 --> 59:02.069
And women like me, goddamn it.

59:02.164 --> 59:05.282
Hell, the only one thing
I've ever been good for is lovin'.

59:05.375 --> 59:07.412
Women go crazy for me.
That's a really true fact.

59:07.502 --> 59:10.085
Ratso, hell, Crazy Annie,
they had to send her away.

59:10.172 --> 59:13.836
Then how come you ain't scored once
the whole time you've been in New York?

59:14.634 --> 59:18.423
'Cause I need management, goddamn it!
'Cause you stole $20 off of me!

59:18.513 --> 59:21.722
And that's why you're gonna stop
crappin' around about Florida

59:21.808 --> 59:25.267
and get your skinny butt movin',
earn $20 worth of management,

59:25.353 --> 59:26.969
which you owe me.

59:52.506 --> 59:54.338
Signora...

59:54.424 --> 59:56.916
A woman in your condition
shouldn't have to do all this.

01:00:00.055 --> 01:00:02.047
Boy, you have a lot of laundry here.

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:15.643
<i>Well, it just ain't right,
cheatin' from a pregnant lady.</i>

01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:18.445
- What did it cost her?
- What do you mean, what'd it cost her?

01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:21.946
Get outta here. The laundry syndicate
lost a couple of coins. I'm cryin'.

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:23.651
- That's it, sir.
- All right.

01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:26.658
That's good. Sir, where's mine?
The black homburg.

01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:29.741
- I-I brought it in at the same time.
- Well, I tell you, I don't know.

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:33.579
You no have a hat here, mister.
You gotta bring me the ticket.

01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:36.039
What about that black homburg
right up there? Up in there.

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:37.840
Is that... Is that it right there?

01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:41.673
- You want... A ticket? Here's my ticket.
- All right.

01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:44.346
It's right there on the corner.
You wanna get it, right over there?

01:00:44.432 --> 01:00:46.219
All right. I'll look 'em over.

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:48.551
Keep goin'. Up to the top.

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.307
Right in the corner there. The top one.

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:54.641
No, you know, it not belong
to yours. It belong somebody else.

01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:55.724
Hey!

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:28.883
Hey, you're pretty damn good at that. I bet
you could make a livin' at it if you tried.

01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:31.469
And end up a hunchback like my old man?

01:01:31.563 --> 01:01:34.931
If you think I'm crippled, you should've
caught him at the end of the day.

01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:03.133
My old man spent 14 hours a day
down in that subway.

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:08.552
He'd come home at night, two, three dollars'
worth of change stained with shoe polish.

01:02:08.642 --> 01:02:13.057
Stupid bastard coughed his lungs out
from breathin' in that wax all day.

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:18.311
Even the faggot undertaker
couldn't get his nails clean.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:21.944
They had to bury him with gloves on.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:26.566
Okay, go ahead. Come on. Take a look.

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:30.362
Don't rush me, boy.

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:32.447
Gotta take your time here.

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:34.957
Get myself primed up,

01:02:35.043 --> 01:02:38.627
like I was turnin' on the charm
for some pretty little blonde lady, you know?

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:42.544
Then when I'm feeling cool and good,
I spin around.

01:02:45.136 --> 01:02:47.628
And there you are, you handsome devil, you.

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:50.013
Not bad.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.716
Not bad.

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:56.474
For a cowboy.

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:01.024
You're okay.

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:04.402
You're okay.

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:12.911
And you will be punctual, won't you?

01:03:12.998 --> 01:03:15.206
The lady will meet you in the lobby.

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:20.495
Taxi!

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:29.132
Yes, sir. Oh, I think you got
somethin' on your shoulder there.

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:32.135
There, you got it. Go ahead. Go ahead.

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:36.219
Say, uh, you haven't got a quarter,
have you?

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:37.929
Just a quarter?

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.688
- How do you like that cheap bastard?
- Let's see what the hell you got here.

01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:50.400
Listen, I think we struck gold.
This is one high-class chick.

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:53.827
"Barclay Hotel for Women."

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:55.905
<i>Women.</i>

01:03:56.916 --> 01:03:59.829
Is this the Gentleman's Escort Service?

01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:03.458
I'm calling for, uh, Miss Beecham, uh,

01:04:03.548 --> 01:04:05.585
at the Barclay Hotel.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:09.168
Right. Well, she changed her mind.
She won't need nobody tonight.

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:12.471
That's right. Thank you very much. Bye.

01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:29.030
Would you believe a whole
goddamn hotel with nothin' but lonely ladies?

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:30.947
Score once in a setup like that,

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:33.742
and, Christ, the way they talk,
I could open up an office in there.

01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:35.319
Come on.

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:41.033
Go ahead. Get the money.

01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:44.537
Listen!

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:47.248
Get the cash.
Remember that lady in the penthouse.

01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:49.880
Get the cash. Those rich ladies
write out a check at night,

01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:52.086
and in the morning they call the bank
and stop payment.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.923
Go ahead. Watch the car!

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:56.803
Go on.

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:08.037
Rico!

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.334
Hey, Rico!

01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:13.463
Rico! Up here!

01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:15.920
Up here! Rico!

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.401
B-6.

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:41.829
G-49.

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:44.828
G-49.

01:06:44.918 --> 01:06:46.705
I-24.

01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:48.627
I-24.

01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:51.046
- And the next one is...
- Oh!

01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:53.749
O-62, ladies and gentlemen.

01:06:54.886 --> 01:06:58.095
<i>O-62! Are there any bingos?</i>

01:06:58.181 --> 01:07:02.175
<i>- And the next one is B-13.</i>
- How dare you, in this public place!

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:05.852
Wait a second, lady!
Goddamn it, you keep your hands off me, sir.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:24.473
<i>The temperature right now is 28 degrees,</i>

01:08:24.559 --> 01:08:26.926
<i>and the weatherman says
it's going down tonight.</i>

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:30.934
<i>Very cloudy now, and we can expect
a few snow flurries later on.</i>

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:32.448
I'll give you five dollars for it.

01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:38.872
Yeah.

01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:46.501
Oh, for Christ's sake!

01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:09.773
Hey, Ratso.

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:15.658
Hey, get your ass out here.

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:17.740
I wanna show you something.

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:34.597
There you go, boy. There's money for you.

01:12:35.726 --> 01:12:38.560
That's nine dollars right there,
plus assorted change.

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:41.347
Minus 26 cents for milk.

01:12:42.316 --> 01:12:45.480
Plus five cents for Dentyne. Gum.

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:52.858
Oh, tha-that's smart. Light a cigarette.

01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:58.956
Why don't you take that and buy a carton,
do the job right?

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:01.617
Where'd you get it?

01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:05.044
I got it.

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:10.042
Where you been? 42nd Street?

01:13:10.136 --> 01:13:12.093
That's where you been.

01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:16.594
- Movies, that's where you've been, ain't it?
- I ain't been nowhere.

01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:20.303
Yeah, movies. That's where
you got that thing on your back.

01:13:21.856 --> 01:13:24.394
- What, this?
- "What, this?"

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:26.645
A friend I once did a favor for
give it to me.

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:28.022
- A friend!
- Yeah.

01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:29.648
Who'd you ever do a favor for?

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:31.901
You just let some poor bastard
freeze to death, wouldn't you?

01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:33.778
You stole the damn thing, didn't you?
You stole it.

01:13:35.953 --> 01:13:37.489
I stoled it for you!

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.572
The goddamn thing's ten sizes
too big for me.

01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:41.577
Wear it yourself.
I wouldn't have it on my back.

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:44.375
I'll be goddamned if I'll wear it.

01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:45.953
Here.

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:53.924
Oh, buy yourself some medicine
before you die on my damn hands.

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:34.759
- I hate boneyards.
- So split.

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:36.837
He ain't your goddamn father.

01:15:11.549 --> 01:15:13.541
He was even dumber than you.

01:15:13.634 --> 01:15:15.796
He couldn't even write his own name.

01:15:16.721 --> 01:15:19.213
"X." That's what it oughta say
on that goddamn headstone.

01:15:19.306 --> 01:15:20.922
One big lousy "X."

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:22.974
Just like our dump.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.928
Condemned by order of city hall.

01:15:31.652 --> 01:15:33.518
My grandma, Sally Buck...

01:15:34.989 --> 01:15:37.151
she died without lettin' me know.

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:52.789
Who are you, Hitler's storm troopers?

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:56.171
Just because I happened to get out of a car!
Would you believe that?

01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:58.252
It all depends on what you believe in.

01:15:58.345 --> 01:16:03.340
You know, like sometimes your spirit
goes up, sometimes it goes...

01:16:03.434 --> 01:16:05.676
It goes, uh... It goes other places.

01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:09.764
How long did I hold up traffic
just to get out? I ask you.

01:16:09.857 --> 01:16:14.067
Give some people a little power,
and they gotta supersede their authority.

01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:17.772
This whole kind of thing is spiritual...
spiritual matters.

01:16:17.865 --> 01:16:20.903
Oh, now you're talkin' priest talk.
You're talkin' priest talk now.

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:23.736
I ain't talkin' priest talk.
I'm talkin' about what people believe in.

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:26.572
Some people believe
you can come back in another body.

01:16:28.459 --> 01:16:30.701
Well, I hope I don't come back in your body.

01:16:30.795 --> 01:16:32.787
I ain't asking you to come back in my body.

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.712
I'm just saying
you can come back as anything.

01:16:34.799 --> 01:16:38.543
You could come back
as a... a dog or a president.

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:42.592
If I had my choice between a dog and a
president, I'd come back as a president.

01:16:42.681 --> 01:16:45.344
I ain't that dumb. What do you think?

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:50.645
Maybe you've gotta think
about those things for a while.

01:16:51.565 --> 01:16:55.024
I'm usually not like this. I'm usually
a very calm and collected person.

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:57.398
Really, forgive me. I'm awfully sorry.

01:16:57.488 --> 01:16:59.855
I think I'm gonna write a letter
to the mayor.

01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:06.244
I don't believe in any of that crap.
You're entitled to think what you want.

01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:08.242
- Well, maybe I <i>do</i> think what I want.
- Him.

01:17:08.332 --> 01:17:12.952
Maybe I <i>do</i> believe all that damn stuff,
and I... and I...

01:17:15.714 --> 01:17:17.876
- Do some thinkin' about it, that's all.
- Here.

01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:25.051
What was that all about?

01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:29.181
Hey, lookee here.
I've been chosen for some damn thing.

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:30.761
Hey.

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:33.980
- It's a come-on.
- Yeah, you know what this is?

01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:36.399
This is a come-on to a party, is what it is.

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:38.977
It's a couple of wackos advertising.
Where does it say to go?

01:17:39.071 --> 01:17:40.812
Klein's Bargain Basement?

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:44.570
You go there and get a ten-year subscription
to the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica.</i>

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:49.246
It says "Broadway and Harmony Lane, Hansel
and Gretel McAlbertson. One flight up."

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:51.573
- That's perfectly clear, ain't it?
- Get outta here.

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:55.627
What do a couple of fruity wackos like that
want with characters like you and me?

01:17:55.713 --> 01:17:57.830
It don't say nothin' about you.

01:17:57.923 --> 01:18:00.040
Don't say nothin' about you.

01:18:01.969 --> 01:18:04.336
- Don't say nothin' about you either.
- They took my picture, didn't they?

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:06.638
- Give me this thing.
- So what are you driving at?

01:18:06.724 --> 01:18:09.182
You want me to get lost
so you can go to your fancy-ass party?

01:18:09.268 --> 01:18:11.760
Wait a minute. Wait a second.
I didn't say nothin' about that.

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:14.471
Did I say that? Did I?

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:20.144
I'll just tell 'em. "You want me,
I don't go nowhere without my buddy here."

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:26.866
I ain't dressed for a party.

01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:40.379
There you go. Right here.

01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:47.546
Hey, dog.

01:19:05.032 --> 01:19:06.944
Hey, you all right?

01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:09.993
You okay?

01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:15.912
Hell, damn,
you're sweating all over the damn place.

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:19.161
Come here.

01:19:30.683 --> 01:19:32.925
You got a comb on you?

01:19:33.018 --> 01:19:35.055
I don't need a comb.

01:19:35.145 --> 01:19:36.727
Here.

01:19:36.814 --> 01:19:39.682
Few dozen cooties ain't gonna kill me,
I don't guess.

01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:49.149
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:19:49.243 --> 01:19:51.075
- I look okay?
- Yeah.

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:56.623
Okay, come on. Come on.

01:20:04.383 --> 01:20:06.215
They're takin' my picture.

01:20:21.025 --> 01:20:23.517
Uh, now just one more close-up of her.

01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:26.023
I love everything in the theater.

01:20:26.113 --> 01:20:29.231
I would like to die on the stage.

01:20:29.867 --> 01:20:31.483
And my hair is fur, you know.

01:20:31.577 --> 01:20:35.287
Its tendrils reaching out
into space sometimes.

01:20:35.372 --> 01:20:37.864
I've watched it touch many stars.

01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:39.824
Wackos. They're all wackos.

01:20:39.918 --> 01:20:43.286
I think we better find somebody
and tell 'em that I'm here.

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:44.871
Hey!

01:20:45.883 --> 01:20:48.421
Uh, well, I made it.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.968
This is my friend Ratso Rizzo and I.

01:20:51.055 --> 01:20:53.968
- Rico. Rico Rizzo.
- Hello.

01:20:54.058 --> 01:20:58.177
If you need anything, there's beer
and stuff behind me. Anything you want.

01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:00.553
Oh, Jesus.

01:21:05.652 --> 01:21:07.735
If you want the word
on that brother-and-sister act,

01:21:07.821 --> 01:21:11.030
Hansel's a fag, and Gretel's got the hots
for herself, so who cares, right?

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:12.948
Load up on the salami.

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:15.948
- It's like what?
- It's like heroin. Death is like heroin.

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:17.529
- It's nothing.
- Have you tried heroin?

01:21:17.623 --> 01:21:20.331
Yeah, I've tried heroin.
It's like nothing. It's like death.

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:21.624
It's just nothing.

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:24.168
- Why are you here?
- I don't know.

01:21:24.254 --> 01:21:25.836
Who brought you?

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:28.964
I don't know.

01:21:59.039 --> 01:22:01.406
Hey, whoa.
Hey, sonny, what you doin' there?

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.412
She gave it to me, boy.

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:45.993
Hey, what do you want? Up or down?

01:22:47.129 --> 01:22:48.586
Up or down?

01:22:48.672 --> 01:22:50.664
Here, why don't you take an upper.

01:24:15.592 --> 01:24:17.800
Why are you stealing food?

01:24:18.637 --> 01:24:21.380
I was just, uh, noticin'
that you're out of salami.

01:24:21.473 --> 01:24:25.387
I think you oughta have somebody go over
to the delicatessen, bring some more back.

01:24:25.477 --> 01:24:28.970
Well, you know, it's free.
You don't have to steal it.

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:31.476
If it's free, then I ain't stealin'.

01:24:31.567 --> 01:24:34.184
<i>What's the matter?
How did you get crippled?</i>

01:24:34.278 --> 01:24:37.271
I slipped on a banana peel. Come on.
I gotta sit down. I feel crummy.

01:24:37.364 --> 01:24:39.481
- What's the matter with you?
- Take your hands off of me.

01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:42.409
- Why don't you run up and use my shower.
- Why don't you take a walk.

01:24:42.494 --> 01:24:44.827
Just take your hands off of me!
Don't touch me!

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:46.905
<i>- Just take a walk!
- Take a shave.</i>

01:24:46.999 --> 01:24:49.992
- I'm just going to lick the sweat off.
- Keep your hands off of me!

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:51.701
Well, you look hot!

01:24:51.795 --> 01:24:54.333
- Guess who I am.
- Who?

01:24:54.423 --> 01:24:56.710
It's me!

01:24:57.593 --> 01:25:00.506
How you doin'?
You're gettin' your picture took, huh?

01:25:16.028 --> 01:25:17.735
Hi.

01:26:06.286 --> 01:26:08.198
Oh, no, no.

01:26:14.252 --> 01:26:15.743
Hey.

01:26:17.506 --> 01:26:19.338
Let's, uh...

01:26:21.718 --> 01:26:23.334
leave now.

01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:27.338
Your place...

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.091
or mine?

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:37.603
- She's hooked.
- Like why a cowboy?

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:39.935
I'd say she was good for ten bucks,
but I'll ask for 20.

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:42.020
Why a cowboy whore?

01:26:42.114 --> 01:26:43.855
Did you know we were gonna make it?

01:26:44.783 --> 01:26:47.526
So, uh, you really wanna do business?

01:26:47.619 --> 01:26:49.451
Who is he?

01:26:51.081 --> 01:26:52.993
Don't tell me you two are a couple.

01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:55.291
Hey.

01:27:02.259 --> 01:27:04.125
Why are you laughing, Joe?

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:07.053
- Are you really a cowboy?
- Well, I'll tell you the truth now.

01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:10.598
I ain't a for-real cowboy,
but I am one hell of a stud.

01:27:10.684 --> 01:27:14.018
A very expensive stud,
and I happen to be his manager.

01:27:17.774 --> 01:27:20.608
Incidentally,
how much is this gonna cost me?

01:27:20.694 --> 01:27:22.435
Twenty bucks.

01:27:23.363 --> 01:27:24.899
- Okay.
- And taxi fare for me.

01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:27.733
Oh, get lost, will ya?

01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:31.365
I agree, but for that service
I charge one buck taxi fare.

01:27:33.457 --> 01:27:37.121
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

01:27:37.210 --> 01:27:38.701
Oh, boy.

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:42.080
Here.

01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:46.505
- Go ahead.
- Give me a break.

01:27:46.595 --> 01:27:49.759
Listen, I don't even know what your name is.
I wanna know your name. What is it?

01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:52.386
- My name's Joe!
- Joe! Ah!

01:27:52.476 --> 01:27:54.263
Fabulous!

01:27:54.352 --> 01:27:57.095
Joe could be anyone. I like that.

01:27:57.189 --> 01:28:00.148
Move over, Joe. Come here, Joe.
Kiss me, Joe.

01:28:00.233 --> 01:28:02.691
That's a very good idea.
Why don't you kiss me, Joe?

01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:10.362
Oh, my... Wow!

01:28:11.161 --> 01:28:12.493
Too much.

01:28:12.579 --> 01:28:14.070
He fell.

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:16.284
Hey, fella, you fell.

01:28:18.919 --> 01:28:20.455
Is he all right?

01:28:21.421 --> 01:28:23.333
Yeah, he's fine.

01:28:23.423 --> 01:28:26.336
Well, if you're all right,
why you hangin' on the banister?

01:28:26.426 --> 01:28:29.260
- Can't you walk or not?
- Naturally, I can walk.

01:28:29.346 --> 01:28:31.838
Yeah. He's got taxi fare.

01:28:31.932 --> 01:28:34.549
Come on.

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:37.511
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yeah.

01:28:37.604 --> 01:28:39.516
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:28:45.278 --> 01:28:47.395
Hey, Ratso!

01:28:47.489 --> 01:28:51.403
Whoopee-tee-yi-yo, boy! Whoo-hah!

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:21.853
Well, it happens.

01:29:23.650 --> 01:29:27.064
- Don't worry about it.
- It ain't never happened to me before.

01:29:28.321 --> 01:29:30.734
You bet your bottom dollar on that.

01:29:31.658 --> 01:29:33.991
Where's the matches, ma'am?

01:29:34.077 --> 01:29:36.069
Over there behind that thing.

01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:49.878
Maybe if you didn't call me "ma'am,"

01:29:49.968 --> 01:29:52.335
things might work out better.

01:29:52.429 --> 01:29:55.797
That's the first goddamn time
the thing ever quit on me.

01:29:59.352 --> 01:30:00.968
That's a fact.

01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:04.222
You think I'm lyin' to you?

01:30:04.316 --> 01:30:06.808
No. No, I don't think you're lying.

01:30:07.903 --> 01:30:09.895
I just had this funny image.

01:30:11.281 --> 01:30:14.865
I had this image of a, um, policeman

01:30:14.951 --> 01:30:16.533
without his stick

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:19.328
and a, uh, bugler without his horn.

01:30:20.373 --> 01:30:22.330
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

01:30:24.336 --> 01:30:26.202
Oh.

01:30:27.672 --> 01:30:29.538
Well, I think I'm making it worse.

01:30:36.598 --> 01:30:39.306
Maybe we oughta take a little nap...

01:30:41.436 --> 01:30:43.769
and see what happens.

01:30:43.855 --> 01:30:46.347
- I ain't sleepy.
- Oh.

01:30:53.657 --> 01:30:55.614
I know.

01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:57.191
Scribbage.

01:31:10.215 --> 01:31:12.002
Shit!

01:31:21.643 --> 01:31:23.976
Now, look at this here. See?

01:31:24.062 --> 01:31:26.395
There's an "E" in "money."

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:28.063
I mean, if that's your word.

01:31:28.858 --> 01:31:30.645
M-O-N-Y.

01:31:30.735 --> 01:31:34.524
That's just exactly how you spell it
up there on that big building up there.

01:31:34.614 --> 01:31:36.606
M-O-N-Y, money.

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:41.777
"Y."

01:31:41.871 --> 01:31:43.658
What in the hell starts with "Y"?

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:49.126
Well, it can end in "Y"...

01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:55.125
like, uh, "say," "pay"...

01:31:56.386 --> 01:31:58.048
"lay."

01:31:58.763 --> 01:32:00.425
Hey, pay,

01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:02.840
lay.

01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:07.519
Okay, cut it out now. That's enough.

01:32:07.605 --> 01:32:10.222
You're cheating.
Teasin' me so I can't think.

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:16.354
"Gay" ends in "Y."

01:32:16.448 --> 01:32:17.734
Hmm?

01:32:19.284 --> 01:32:21.492
Do you like that?

01:32:21.578 --> 01:32:23.319
Cut that out.

01:32:23.413 --> 01:32:25.325
Gay, fey.

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:28.616
Is that your problem, baby?

01:32:30.503 --> 01:32:32.916
I'm gonna show you my darn problem!

01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:35.225
Ow!

01:33:46.538 --> 01:33:48.575
I'm not.

01:33:48.665 --> 01:33:50.782
I'm not exaggerating.

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:54.159
Listen, Marjorie.

01:33:54.254 --> 01:33:57.543
You should try it.
It might be terrific for you.

01:33:58.967 --> 01:34:01.084
Oh, for God's sake.

01:34:01.177 --> 01:34:03.339
Well, what night is Phil's poker night?

01:34:04.639 --> 01:34:06.255
Well, think.

01:34:07.142 --> 01:34:08.553
Yeah, all right.

01:34:08.643 --> 01:34:11.932
Uh, Joe, are you available Thursday night?

01:34:12.021 --> 01:34:15.435
What time? Yeah, around 8:30?

01:34:15.525 --> 01:34:19.018
Uh, well, let me think now.
Thursday, 8:30.

01:34:19.863 --> 01:34:22.606
Uh, well, I guess I can be available.

01:34:22.699 --> 01:34:24.190
Hell, yes!

01:34:25.243 --> 01:34:28.953
Hello. Marjorie,
it's all set for Thursday night at 8:30.

01:34:30.081 --> 01:34:34.416
Yes, it's... No, no. I can't talk to you now,
so call me at the office later.

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:36.494
Yeah, okay. Bye-bye.

01:34:38.047 --> 01:34:41.211
Ma'am, Shirley,
I sure hate to trouble you, but...

01:34:41.301 --> 01:34:42.792
Sure.

01:34:45.305 --> 01:34:47.797
- Twenty, wasn't it?
- Yes'm.

01:34:55.398 --> 01:34:56.980
Bye.

01:35:19.172 --> 01:35:21.880
Hey, boy. Look right in there.
What do you see?

01:35:21.966 --> 01:35:24.629
Look in there, boy.
Some of that stuff's for you too.

01:35:24.719 --> 01:35:27.086
Look. Try that on for size for you.

01:35:27.931 --> 01:35:30.594
I got some of that stuff
you like to swill too.

01:35:30.683 --> 01:35:33.300
Aspirin, Mentholatum, all that crap.

01:35:36.314 --> 01:35:39.523
- What's the matter? They wrong?
- They're okay.

01:35:39.609 --> 01:35:41.601
Only why'd you buy 'em?

01:35:41.694 --> 01:35:44.937
While you were gettin' the aspirin,
I could've lifted this.

01:35:45.031 --> 01:35:46.363
Is that hot?

01:35:47.784 --> 01:35:49.696
- Yeah. You want some soup?
- Yeah.

01:35:49.786 --> 01:35:51.823
I'll get you some soup then.

01:35:51.913 --> 01:35:54.701
We ain't gonna have to steal no more,
is what I'm tryin' to tell you.

01:35:54.791 --> 01:35:58.250
I got eight bucks in my damn pockets.
Twenty more come Thursday, boy.

01:35:58.336 --> 01:36:00.669
We're gonna be ridin' easy before very long,
I'm gonna tell you.

01:36:00.755 --> 01:36:02.667
Give me some soup. Give me some soup.

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:05.670
What do you think I'm gettin' here?
I'm gettin' you some soup.

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.844
Look at that there.
That's good, healthy stuff for you.

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:11.634
Lookee there. Lookee there. Soup.

01:36:11.724 --> 01:36:13.932
- Thanks.
- It's hot. Watch out.

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:16.768
How was she?

01:36:17.522 --> 01:36:20.731
Well, she went crazy,
if you want to know the damn truth of it.

01:36:20.817 --> 01:36:23.776
- Yeah?
- Yeah. She turned into a damn alley cat.

01:36:23.861 --> 01:36:26.729
- Thanks for the stuff.
- Don't mention it.

01:36:27.991 --> 01:36:29.482
It's good.

01:36:33.413 --> 01:36:35.496
Hey, listen,
don't get sore or anything, okay?

01:36:35.581 --> 01:36:37.197
I ain't sore.

01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:40.626
I don't think I can walk anymore.

01:36:40.712 --> 01:36:42.999
I mean, I've been fallin' down a lot.

01:36:46.926 --> 01:36:48.133
I'm scared.

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:50.836
What are you scared of?

01:36:51.764 --> 01:36:54.632
You know what they do to you
when they know you can't...

01:36:54.726 --> 01:36:57.890
when they find out that you can't wa... walk.

01:36:57.979 --> 01:36:59.436
Oh, Christ!

01:37:02.317 --> 01:37:04.479
I gotta lay down.

01:37:04.569 --> 01:37:06.561
- Okay, okay.
- I gotta lay down.

01:37:06.654 --> 01:37:08.691
You're gonna lay down now.
Just take it easy.

01:37:08.781 --> 01:37:10.773
- Come on.
- I'm gonna lay you down.

01:37:11.409 --> 01:37:13.617
I'm gonna lay you down. There you go.

01:37:15.204 --> 01:37:17.537
I'm gonna put this thing over you.

01:37:17.623 --> 01:37:19.364
Now, you stay here.

01:37:21.627 --> 01:37:23.414
Where you goin'?

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:25.621
- I gotta get a doctor.
- What?

01:37:25.715 --> 01:37:28.002
- I gotta get a doctor.
- You ain't gettin' me no doctor.

01:37:28.092 --> 01:37:30.709
You're sick, boy. You need a damn doctor.

01:37:30.803 --> 01:37:34.592
Hey! No doctors, no cops.
Don't be so stupid.

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:37.800
- What the hell you want me to do?
- Florida. You get me to Florida.

01:37:37.894 --> 01:37:40.762
Oh, hell, I can't go to Florida now.

01:37:40.855 --> 01:37:43.438
Just put me on a bus.
Just put me on a bus. I don't need you.

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:46.187
You got the damn fever.
How the hell you gonna get to Florida?

01:37:46.277 --> 01:37:49.145
Just get me on a bus.
You ain't sendin' me to Bellevue.

01:37:49.238 --> 01:37:52.356
All right. What are you doin'?
What are you doin' that for? It's hot.

01:37:53.326 --> 01:37:56.114
- You're sick. I'm keepin' it on you.
- No. I'm too hot now.

01:37:56.204 --> 01:37:59.072
Dumb. Boy, you're really dumb.

01:37:59.165 --> 01:38:01.532
- I don't need you. You're dumb.
- Shut up! Just shut up!

01:38:01.626 --> 01:38:03.117
Dumb cowboy, boy.

01:38:03.211 --> 01:38:05.669
Damn it. Shut up!

01:38:05.755 --> 01:38:10.341
Oh, just when things are goin' right for me,
you gotta pull a damn stunt like this.

01:38:13.179 --> 01:38:15.455
Hi, Shirley. How you doin', girl?

01:38:16.808 --> 01:38:18.299
Miss who?

01:38:20.144 --> 01:38:22.636
Well, when will Mrs. Gardner be home?

01:38:24.190 --> 01:38:26.648
This is a friend of hers.
This is a goddamn good friend of hers.

01:38:26.734 --> 01:38:28.225
Now, you...

01:38:31.781 --> 01:38:33.898
Well, hell, I can't wait that long.

01:38:51.008 --> 01:38:53.421
Too bad.

01:38:53.511 --> 01:38:58.472
Well, we all have our off days.

01:38:58.558 --> 01:39:03.053
I'm Townsend P. Locke, from Chicago.
Call me Towny.

01:39:03.146 --> 01:39:08.232
I'm here on a paper manufacturers convention
and, frankly, to have a little fun, damn it.

01:39:08.317 --> 01:39:11.901
This is my first night in town, and I'd consider
it a privilege if you'd have dinner with me.

01:39:11.988 --> 01:39:15.106
Anywhere you say. There's a little
French restaurant not too far from here.

01:39:15.199 --> 01:39:17.486
Italian restaurant? Does that appeal to you?

01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:22.159
Don't worry about how you're dressed.
They know me.

01:39:22.248 --> 01:39:24.080
Besides, I'll tell 'em you're with the rodeo.

01:39:24.167 --> 01:39:26.955
There's always a rodeo in town, damn it.

01:39:27.044 --> 01:39:29.957
Besides, you look very elegant.

01:39:30.047 --> 01:39:34.667
Oh, but damn it all, we can't do that.
I'm expecting a telephone call at the hotel.

01:39:35.553 --> 01:39:37.510
Mama? A coincidence.

01:39:37.597 --> 01:39:40.089
Guess who was being discussed.

01:39:40.183 --> 01:39:42.971
Have you got that thing turned up?

01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:45.347
Well, why aren't you wearing it?

01:39:45.438 --> 01:39:48.351
Oh, really, Mama, this is just impossible.

01:39:48.441 --> 01:39:51.024
I mean, why go to all the expense?

01:39:51.110 --> 01:39:54.023
- Why go to all the expense, Mama? The expense.
- Listen, Towny.

01:39:54.113 --> 01:39:56.856
Did I tell you I got me
a sick kid on my hands?

01:39:56.949 --> 01:40:01.034
Well, he is. He's sick on chill,
and I gotta get him south quick as I can.

01:40:02.079 --> 01:40:05.823
I got me a sick boy,
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna get him south.

01:40:05.917 --> 01:40:07.909
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me, Towny?

01:40:08.002 --> 01:40:10.369
I'm gonna get him south.

01:40:11.005 --> 01:40:12.337
What you want?

01:40:13.424 --> 01:40:16.132
What you got me up here for?

01:40:16.219 --> 01:40:17.710
Oh, Joe, it's...

01:40:19.096 --> 01:40:20.712
It's so difficult. I...

01:40:22.183 --> 01:40:25.472
You're a nice person, Joe.
I should never have asked you up here.

01:40:27.855 --> 01:40:29.642
You're a lovely person, really.

01:40:32.443 --> 01:40:35.356
Oh, God, I loathe life. I loathe it.

01:40:36.364 --> 01:40:38.196
Please go. Please.

01:40:38.282 --> 01:40:39.773
You want me to leave?

01:40:41.661 --> 01:40:43.152
No.

01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:47.497
I mean, yes, yes. Please go.

01:40:48.167 --> 01:40:50.625
Come back tomorrow. Promise?

01:40:50.711 --> 01:40:52.247
I'm goin' to Florida tomorrow.

01:40:53.130 --> 01:40:54.962
That's terrible.

01:40:55.049 --> 01:40:57.132
You meet someone, you think...

01:40:57.218 --> 01:40:58.629
Yeah.

01:40:59.595 --> 01:41:01.131
I want to give you a present...

01:41:02.139 --> 01:41:04.256
for your trip.

01:41:06.185 --> 01:41:07.926
Please take it.

01:41:10.147 --> 01:41:12.013
I want you to have it.

01:41:12.650 --> 01:41:14.482
You don't have to be a Catholic.

01:41:14.569 --> 01:41:16.481
<i>St. Christopher's the patron saint
of all travelers.</i>

01:41:16.571 --> 01:41:20.110
I want you to take it.
It's for helping me be good.

01:41:21.534 --> 01:41:23.150
I gotta have money.

01:41:24.287 --> 01:41:26.825
Yes, of course. Wait here.

01:41:36.132 --> 01:41:37.623
I said wait.

01:41:39.093 --> 01:41:41.631
Here. Don't even thank me.

01:41:41.721 --> 01:41:43.383
I gotta have more than ten.

01:41:43.472 --> 01:41:46.385
- I gotta have $57.
- I simply don't have it, Joe.

01:41:46.976 --> 01:41:49.764
- I got family, goddamn it.
- You're wasting your time, Joe.

01:41:49.854 --> 01:41:52.562
- There's nothing in here.
- Get outta my way, please, sir.

01:41:53.357 --> 01:41:56.065
Get outta my way!

01:41:56.152 --> 01:41:57.893
- No, no, no.
- Let go of that table, please, sir.

01:41:57.987 --> 01:42:00.274
- No, you... Please, sir?
- No, please!

01:42:00.364 --> 01:42:02.401
No, don't, don't.

01:42:02.491 --> 01:42:04.608
No. No. Don't.

01:42:04.702 --> 01:42:07.490
Oh, I deserve that.
I brought this on myself, I know I did.

01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:11.369
- My nose is bleeding, isn't it?
- Now, you gonna let go of that table?

01:42:11.459 --> 01:42:12.449
No, no.

01:42:12.543 --> 01:42:15.581
Now, are you gonna let go of that table,
or you want a busted skull?

01:42:15.671 --> 01:42:18.664
Oh, Joe, Joe, Joe.

01:42:22.637 --> 01:42:24.799
Oh, Joe. Thank you.

01:42:24.889 --> 01:42:26.050
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:27.927
<i>Operator. Number, please.</i>

01:42:28.893 --> 01:42:31.385
<i>- Number, please.</i>
- Hello.

01:42:31.479 --> 01:42:33.971
- No, no, I wasn't calling anyone.
<i>- Hello?</i>

01:42:34.065 --> 01:42:35.351
<i>Hello!</i>

01:42:35.441 --> 01:42:39.105
- I wasn't calling anyone. I wasn't calling anyone.
<i>- Hello!</i>

01:42:39.195 --> 01:42:42.313
No, I wasn't calling anyone.

01:42:42.406 --> 01:42:43.522
Oh, Joe, Joe, Joe.

01:42:55.878 --> 01:42:57.710
Thirty-one hours.

01:42:58.798 --> 01:43:01.290
11:30 in the morning we get there.

01:43:02.385 --> 01:43:06.629
Not this morning, but the next at 11:30.

01:43:07.932 --> 01:43:10.299
These guys are good drivers, boy.

01:43:10.393 --> 01:43:11.884
They gotta be.

01:43:15.523 --> 01:43:17.515
You didn't kill him, did you?

01:43:19.026 --> 01:43:21.018
Got blood on your jacket.

01:43:24.448 --> 01:43:26.360
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:02.355
If you're gonna shiver,
put your blankets up more.

01:44:05.573 --> 01:44:07.189
I've been thinkin'.

01:44:07.283 --> 01:44:10.776
I hope we're not gonna have a lot of trouble
about my name down there.

01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:13.487
I mean, what's the whole point
of this trip anyway?

01:44:13.581 --> 01:44:15.413
You know?

01:44:15.499 --> 01:44:17.491
Keep your blankets on you.

01:44:20.004 --> 01:44:24.169
I mean, can you see this guy
running around the beach all suntanned

01:44:24.258 --> 01:44:26.841
and he's goin' swimmin', like,

01:44:26.927 --> 01:44:30.546
and then somebody yells, "Hey, Ratso."

01:44:31.682 --> 01:44:33.298
What's that sound like to you?

01:44:35.102 --> 01:44:36.934
Sounds like they knew you.

01:44:38.022 --> 01:44:40.264
Sounds like crap. Admit it.

01:44:40.357 --> 01:44:42.269
I'm Rico all the time, okay?

01:44:47.531 --> 01:44:50.615
We're gonna tell all these new people
my name's Rico.

01:44:53.496 --> 01:44:54.486
Okay?

01:44:55.164 --> 01:44:56.245
Okay.

01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:33.033
Hey, what's the matter?

01:45:33.118 --> 01:45:34.529
I'm wet.

01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:36.327
You're... You're what?

01:45:37.206 --> 01:45:39.448
I wet my pants. The seat's all wet.

01:45:40.543 --> 01:45:44.537
Well, hell, there ain't no use cryin'
over the damn thing.

01:45:46.674 --> 01:45:49.132
Here I am goin' to Florida, my leg hurts,

01:45:49.218 --> 01:45:51.710
my butt hurts, my chest hurts,
my face hurts,

01:45:52.555 --> 01:45:55.172
and like that ain't enough,
I gotta pee all over myself.

01:45:57.142 --> 01:46:00.761
That's funny? I'm fallin' apart here.

01:46:01.772 --> 01:46:04.139
You just... You know what happened?

01:46:04.233 --> 01:46:07.601
You just took a little rest stop
that wasn't on the schedule.

01:46:23.586 --> 01:46:25.578
Let me put you up here.

01:46:30.634 --> 01:46:33.672
Hey, what size pants you wear?

01:47:04.710 --> 01:47:06.542
Thank you, ma'am.

01:47:08.505 --> 01:47:10.918
- Where you from?
- New York.

01:47:12.051 --> 01:47:13.883
You ever been here before?

01:47:13.969 --> 01:47:15.926
No, ma'am, I ain't. This is my first time.

01:47:17.222 --> 01:47:20.511
- Well, I hope you have a good time in Florida.
- Thank you.

01:47:30.569 --> 01:47:32.356
Hey.

01:47:32.446 --> 01:47:34.062
Hey, what are you doin'?

01:47:34.156 --> 01:47:36.990
I'm zippin' your fly.
What the hell you think I'm doin'?

01:48:02.518 --> 01:48:04.635
Thanks, Joe.

01:48:04.728 --> 01:48:06.936
These shirts are comfortable, ain't they?

01:48:07.773 --> 01:48:10.891
Yours was the only one left
with a palm tree on it.

01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:19.783
Clothes are damn cheap here too.
You know that?

01:48:26.417 --> 01:48:29.410
Everything we got
only set us back ten and some.

01:48:32.214 --> 01:48:34.422
Hey, you know, Ratso...

01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:37.337
Rico, I mean.

01:48:37.428 --> 01:48:39.886
I got this damn thing all figured out.

01:48:39.972 --> 01:48:41.964
When we get to Miami,

01:48:42.057 --> 01:48:45.846
what I'm gonna do is get some sort of job,
you know?

01:48:46.812 --> 01:48:49.270
'Cause, hell, I ain't no kind of hustler.

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:52.520
I mean, there must be an easier way
of makin' a livin' than that.

01:48:53.694 --> 01:48:55.856
Some sort of outdoors work.

01:48:57.281 --> 01:48:58.988
What do you think?

01:49:03.704 --> 01:49:05.696
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

01:49:07.666 --> 01:49:09.248
Okay, Rico?

01:49:14.465 --> 01:49:15.956
Rico?

01:49:19.219 --> 01:49:20.630
Rico.

01:49:20.721 --> 01:49:22.212
Hey, Rico?

01:49:23.307 --> 01:49:24.798
Rico?

01:49:57.049 --> 01:50:00.042
Okay, folks, everything's all right.
Nothin' to worry about.

01:50:05.099 --> 01:50:06.715
Is he kin to you?

01:50:09.603 --> 01:50:11.595
Wanna close his eyes?

01:50:11.688 --> 01:50:15.272
- What?
- Just reach over and close his eyes.

01:50:22.282 --> 01:50:26.242
We'll just drive on in, all right?
Nothin' else we can do.

01:50:26.954 --> 01:50:30.447
Okay, folks, just a little illness.
We'll be in Miami in a few minutes.

01:50:35.212 --> 01:50:37.454
Okay, folks, nothin' to worry about.

01:50:37.548 --> 01:50:40.837
Just a little illness.
We'll be in Miami in just a few minutes.
