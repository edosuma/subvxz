03:15.762 --> 03:17.435
I did it!

03:20.834 --> 03:22.711
You really jumped over it?

03:23.236 --> 03:24.806
You did it!

03:26.640 --> 03:28.142
I've outgrown this!

03:28.341 --> 03:30.514
But what about sparring?

03:30.744 --> 03:32.348
You're no match for me!

03:32.379 --> 03:34.017
Come back!

03:34.881 --> 03:36.861
What if Morn finds out!

03:37.551 --> 03:39.827
Don't worry! I'll be back soon!

04:16.423 --> 04:19.096
Thief! Get him!

04:25.665 --> 04:27.144
Let's go!

04:33.907 --> 04:35.147
Giddy up!

05:05.238 --> 05:06.649
Wow!

05:15.115 --> 05:16.253
That's it!

05:59.526 --> 06:01.369
He's amazing.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.036
Twenty-four!

06:04.097 --> 06:05.440
Winner!

07:10.430 --> 07:12.706
Twenty-four! Winner!

07:15.335 --> 07:16.006
Stop!

07:16.036 --> 07:17.344
Who are you?

07:17.537 --> 07:18.709
What's your number?

07:18.738 --> 07:20.718
Who cares? I'm here to fight!

07:20.974 --> 07:22.612
Take him away!

07:48.802 --> 07:50.042
Fight!

07:51.237 --> 07:52.238
Begin!

08:45.258 --> 08:46.931
"Sul-rang."

08:52.699 --> 08:55.043
Sins of Blood must be washed in blood.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.242
Hong-yi will take our lives.

08:59.839 --> 09:00.874
Hong-yi is dead.

09:00.907 --> 09:02.511
Mark my words!

09:04.077 --> 09:06.114
We will die by Hong-yi's hands.

09:17.957 --> 09:18.992
Seize the kid!

09:19.025 --> 09:20.333
Seize him!

09:48.321 --> 09:53.202
General Yu-baek grams big posts
to the combat games' winner.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.296
They'll do anything to win.

09:55.328 --> 09:59.504
Now, any peasant who can
fight can gain a post.

09:59.532 --> 10:03.070
General Yu-baek's power is unstoppable.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.814
Be careful.

10:04.971 --> 10:06.416
What General!

10:06.539 --> 10:08.815
He doesn't even know how to spell his name!

10:08.842 --> 10:11.550
What is the world coming to?

10:11.778 --> 10:13.724
Right, Wol-so?

10:15.582 --> 10:18.324
But I cannot see the world.

10:27.627 --> 10:33.703
The streets are humming!
Don't just drink tea!

10:33.766 --> 10:35.074
My, my!

10:35.135 --> 10:36.705
What's the matter?

10:36.736 --> 10:40.912
Yu-baek held his combat games today.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.682
An incredible kid showed up!

10:43.710 --> 10:46.589
About 5 feet tall.

10:47.247 --> 10:51.389
With a body so slim
and face so tender for a man...

10:51.584 --> 10:54.565
The kid was pretty!

10:55.088 --> 11:01.596
He looked like a girl to me,
but that kid fought like a man!

11:01.628 --> 11:03.107
It can't be.

11:03.129 --> 11:04.699
<i>Sam-who'?</i>

11:07.300 --> 11:08.836
Gam-cho!

11:10.336 --> 11:11.747
Come back!

11:12.005 --> 11:13.245
Come back!

11:13.306 --> 11:14.580
Hong-yi...

11:15.575 --> 11:17.350
Where is she?

11:18.611 --> 11:21.854
"GORYEO: THE ARABIAN MARKET"

11:32.325 --> 11:33.804
Hello!

11:44.170 --> 11:45.581
Who are you?

11:50.944 --> 11:52.184
You have a long tail.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.623
Who are you?

11:53.846 --> 11:56.349
Don't you know who you fought for?

12:03.423 --> 12:05.733
I was impressed by your feats.

12:06.092 --> 12:10.006
Forgive me for chasing you,
but you just vanished.

12:11.364 --> 12:14.311
Why didn't you finish the fight?

12:15.134 --> 12:17.171
I could've beaten him.

12:18.404 --> 12:22.147
But there's no need to see blood.

12:22.442 --> 12:26.515
I just went there to stretch.

12:27.447 --> 12:31.589
Not only a skilled
fighter, but clever, too.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.126
Your name?

12:36.789 --> 12:38.166
It's Gam-cho.

12:39.359 --> 12:40.463
Gam-cho.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.166
Gam-cho?

12:42.528 --> 12:44.439
Whose pupil are you?

12:44.697 --> 12:48.839
I know enough to withhold my master's name.

12:52.205 --> 12:56.210
But if you value mind over moves,
You can lose focus.

12:56.242 --> 12:59.746
Your feet are swift, but
your hands are clumsy.

13:00.413 --> 13:01.949
What?

13:03.783 --> 13:06.161
Unmask me in 3 attempts.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.265
Then I'll acknowledge you.

13:28.374 --> 13:29.717
One!

13:46.959 --> 13:48.438
Two!

14:25.131 --> 14:26.542
Three!

14:27.367 --> 14:29.347
What clumsy hands?

14:39.912 --> 14:42.017
It's time I told her.

14:42.048 --> 14:45.052
It may be too early.

14:45.084 --> 14:47.462
Yu-baek will find us and come.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.961
What if Hong-yi gets hurt?

14:51.591 --> 14:54.936
Freshly picked tea leaves have no scent.

14:55.828 --> 14:59.799
But the more you crumple and harm them...

15:00.433 --> 15:02.811
the stronger their scent will be.

15:24.957 --> 15:29.872
This may be the last tea I brew for you.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.283
Where have you been?

15:53.052 --> 15:54.929
Forgive me!

15:55.221 --> 15:56.825
Just out...

16:03.863 --> 16:05.865
This is for you, Morn.

16:08.167 --> 16:10.579
It's a beautiful red shade.

16:11.904 --> 16:13.247
Whom did you meet?

16:13.306 --> 16:15.547
I just won it in a duel.

16:17.176 --> 16:20.214
He appeared to be an aristocrat.

16:20.246 --> 16:21.247
Did he ask your name?

16:21.280 --> 16:22.782
No!

16:24.617 --> 16:28.656
He asked who my teacher
was, but I didn't say.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.223
Hong-yi...

16:32.992 --> 16:35.939
I'm really sorry!

16:36.262 --> 16:38.139
I won't do it again.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.666
Hong-yi!

16:42.835 --> 16:43.643
Yes?

16:43.669 --> 16:45.410
Why do you train?

16:45.872 --> 16:47.909
Two people. They'll die by my hand.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.552
They killed my parents.

16:51.777 --> 16:53.552
Blood must be washed by blood.

16:53.779 --> 16:57.056
When I turn 20, I will kill them.

17:02.121 --> 17:04.396
You have two enemies.

17:05.223 --> 17:07.704
One saw you for the first time today.

17:08.294 --> 17:09.829
The other...

17:10.997 --> 17:13.204
has followed you for years.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.640
<i>Who are may'?</i>

17:20.705 --> 17:23.380
I'll kill them no matter what!

17:25.243 --> 17:26.689
Really?

17:36.923 --> 17:39.403
This is...

17:41.594 --> 17:43.301
Once you hold that...

17:43.529 --> 17:45.805
there is no turning back.

17:48.134 --> 17:50.136
You sure you won't regret it?

18:13.025 --> 18:14.800
It's Sul-rang's sword...

18:15.828 --> 18:17.671
of the Three Great Swords.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.799
Pung-chun's sword set goals.

18:53.032 --> 18:55.034
Sul-rang's sword fought injustice.

19:04.877 --> 19:08.586
Duk-gi's sword gave protection
and helped achieve the goals.

19:15.655 --> 19:19.831
They were close like siblings
who pledged to die together.

19:20.693 --> 19:26.166
And Sui-rang and Duk-gi
were dear lovers.

19:26.265 --> 19:27.676
Sui-rang!

20:12.044 --> 20:13.546
The Governor's son!

20:13.579 --> 20:15.889
<i>Weve captured LEE Jon-bok!</i>

20:30.963 --> 20:33.500
I'm Pung-chun of the Three Great Swords!

20:33.766 --> 20:36.576
Governor LEE!

20:37.069 --> 20:39.879
Listen to the people!

20:55.621 --> 20:57.259
Pung-chun...

20:57.723 --> 20:59.396
It's Hons-vi!

20:59.792 --> 21:01.203
Hong-yi...

21:05.598 --> 21:08.169
Though you stooped to this...

21:10.736 --> 21:12.841
I'll fight!

21:28.921 --> 21:30.594
Duk-gi!

21:37.163 --> 21:38.437
How...

21:38.864 --> 21:40.002
How!

21:40.166 --> 21:42.168
I've made up my mind.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.372
They promised me.

21:44.470 --> 21:47.144
If you change your mind, all of us...

21:47.640 --> 21:49.950
- and your family will be safe!
- Quiet!

21:50.009 --> 21:53.388
The three of us can do even greater things!

21:53.412 --> 21:58.589
What is greater than
fighting for the people!

22:19.505 --> 22:21.314
No!

22:36.288 --> 22:37.767
I swear...

22:38.123 --> 22:39.932
I'll never forgive you!

22:49.535 --> 22:51.014
Pung-chun!

22:53.572 --> 22:55.017
Pung-chun!

22:58.377 --> 22:59.412
Stop!

23:11.257 --> 23:12.964
Die!

23:32.578 --> 23:36.355
Many died that day
due to Sui-rang and Duk-gi's betrayal.

23:42.721 --> 23:44.632
Including your father...

23:51.096 --> 23:52.803
and your mother.

23:55.501 --> 23:56.844
No...

24:16.622 --> 24:18.329
Don't...

24:18.791 --> 24:19.997
No...

24:54.293 --> 24:56.933
That sword pierced your father's heart.

24:58.464 --> 24:59.704
You lie.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.841
I am Sui-rang.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.406
Duk-gi, the man who gave
you the red mask...

25:05.471 --> 25:09.385
and I, Sui-rang, are your enemies.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.452
You're lying!

25:13.746 --> 25:16.784
You were rash in showing
off your swordsmanship.

25:18.117 --> 25:21.394
See how you've been fed and
clothed by your enemy!

25:21.420 --> 25:24.162
Think you can kill us both?

25:24.323 --> 25:27.702
And avenge your father's blood
with that sword?

25:31.430 --> 25:32.773
Mom...

25:32.998 --> 25:34.534
Mom...

25:35.801 --> 25:37.508
Childish fool!

25:44.209 --> 25:46.416
Still see me as your mom?

25:47.546 --> 25:49.116
Mark my words.

25:49.448 --> 25:52.156
I'm your enemy, Sul-rang!

25:55.054 --> 25:56.590
Leave this house.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.133
The next time we meet, you and me?

26:04.129 --> 26:06.370
One of us will die.

26:56.081 --> 26:57.617
Duk-gi!

27:03.388 --> 27:04.958
Halt!

27:10.462 --> 27:11.998
Bring me tea.

27:12.531 --> 27:14.101
He'll have tea!

27:16.835 --> 27:18.143
Hak-sun.

27:18.303 --> 27:19.646
Yes, sir.

27:20.205 --> 27:22.549
The tea house at the Arabian Market...

27:24.510 --> 27:27.013
Find Gam-cho and his mother there.

27:27.779 --> 27:29.224
The mother...

27:32.284 --> 27:35.060
Bring her to me unharmed.

27:35.287 --> 27:36.561
Yes, sir!

27:56.208 --> 27:57.846
Gam-cho?

27:59.278 --> 28:01.053
- No!
- Gam-cho?

28:01.079 --> 28:02.683
Watch out!

28:27.005 --> 28:28.643
Mum!

28:29.541 --> 28:32.112
Run!

28:34.580 --> 28:36.287
Run away!

29:11.984 --> 29:13.395
Seize her!

29:48.387 --> 29:49.889
Mum!

30:05.370 --> 30:11.844
When the water starts to boil,
it looks like shrimp eyeballs.

30:12.544 --> 30:18.256
Then crab eyes, fish eyes,
and small marbles float up.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.471
Wait!

30:29.161 --> 30:30.697
Not now.

30:30.929 --> 30:33.307
The water isn't boiling yet.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.713
Gam-cho?

30:49.281 --> 30:50.624
Gam-cho!

30:50.682 --> 30:52.320
The woman is blind!

30:54.820 --> 30:56.595
Don't harm the boy!

30:59.257 --> 31:01.601
He has nothing to do with me!

31:09.968 --> 31:12.505
Gam-cho! Say something!

31:14.139 --> 31:15.880
Gam-cho!

31:20.746 --> 31:23.556
Listen to the water bubbling up.

31:33.091 --> 31:35.697
At first it pitter-patters.

31:38.196 --> 31:39.834
Then...

31:40.432 --> 31:43.345
It taps like wheels turning.

31:43.468 --> 31:45.209
Assassins!

31:52.244 --> 31:54.520
The sound of earth shaking...

31:58.417 --> 32:00.556
Then horses trotting...

32:07.526 --> 32:13.499
Then comes the soft, whispering
sound of the wind.

32:16.535 --> 32:19.641
Soon, even the wind fades.

32:21.740 --> 32:24.846
When no sound can be heard...

32:39.057 --> 32:40.468
Now!

32:44.796 --> 32:46.833
It's ready.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.374
The water is boiling.

33:24.135 --> 33:26.081
Let's drink.

34:20.824 --> 34:23.362
I, Yu-baek, have arrived, sir.

34:23.527 --> 34:25.940
You're late again.

34:26.197 --> 34:29.735
I was detained by mischief
from street rascals.

34:30.001 --> 34:31.503
Mischief?

34:31.670 --> 34:36.551
Just a bunch of naive kids, Your Majesty.

34:44.349 --> 34:46.386
Enough!

34:47.052 --> 34:49.828
I am not amused.

34:51.121 --> 34:52.658
Stop!

34:53.925 --> 34:58.999
Their lack of skills is a bore.

34:59.497 --> 35:01.499
How about it, General?

35:01.967 --> 35:04.811
Show them how it's done.

35:05.070 --> 35:07.482
An exquisite idea, sir.

35:07.806 --> 35:11.879
General Yu-baek is
Goryeo's top swordsman.

35:13.745 --> 35:16.055
Why don't you show us?

36:27.052 --> 36:29.396
Fight harder!

36:29.721 --> 36:31.223
Whack!

36:31.256 --> 36:33.327
Hit him hard!

36:34.292 --> 36:37.466
If you beat him, you can be general!

36:38.863 --> 36:42.470
Will there be a new general today, sir?

36:42.500 --> 36:45.674
What happens to Yu-baek?

36:45.704 --> 36:49.049
- Return to his place.
- Where is that'?

36:49.074 --> 36:52.283
- The streets, of course!
- Really?

36:52.410 --> 36:54.890
Try harder, General!

39:30.468 --> 39:32.414
Oh my!

39:37.742 --> 39:41.713
I want liquor!

39:42.080 --> 39:45.027
Get me a drink, now!

39:47.285 --> 39:48.559
It was you!

39:49.888 --> 39:52.095
Let's finish the fight!

40:01.532 --> 40:03.011
You're a mess.

40:03.167 --> 40:04.840
Got kicked out?

40:06.337 --> 40:09.147
Yes! I did.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.647
Why?

40:11.342 --> 40:13.015
I'm not telling!

40:21.152 --> 40:23.063
Fine. Whatever.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.799
But how long has it been?

40:29.360 --> 40:32.432
Hey, kid!

40:42.140 --> 40:43.813
Hey!

40:50.782 --> 40:52.625
You're crying?

41:04.996 --> 41:07.875
Crazy fool! Can't even drink.

41:08.599 --> 41:09.805
Hey!

41:10.034 --> 41:12.844
You crazy fool!

41:13.037 --> 41:14.675
Get Up!

41:36.327 --> 41:38.170
Stay still!

41:55.380 --> 41:57.018
Damn!

42:13.431 --> 42:18.744
Living like this isn't so bad, right?

42:23.541 --> 42:25.714
Drinking all I want.

42:27.678 --> 42:29.954
Eating when I'm hungry.

42:30.748 --> 42:32.659
Sleeping when I'm tired.

42:35.253 --> 42:37.096
And waste your skills?

42:40.091 --> 42:45.632
I can't kill or save anyone, anyway.

42:47.965 --> 42:50.844
With your skills, who can't you kill?

42:59.777 --> 43:01.552
There is.

43:02.547 --> 43:04.618
I can't kill...

43:05.416 --> 43:07.123
I'd rather die.

43:57.335 --> 43:59.042
Look at yourself!

43:59.403 --> 44:02.043
Why do you always come to me like that?

44:02.406 --> 44:04.579
Pung-chun, Sui-rang, Duk-gi...

44:05.176 --> 44:09.386
I never thought you fools
would grow to be so heartless!

44:10.081 --> 44:14.791
You'll go through with
committing that horrific sin?

44:16.220 --> 44:17.893
Pung-chun's sword...

44:18.723 --> 44:20.430
That's what you want'?

44:20.892 --> 44:22.599
Take it and go!

44:22.994 --> 44:25.031
This is my last request.

44:26.998 --> 44:28.807
Please give this to Hong-yi.

44:28.833 --> 44:30.403
Fool!

44:49.620 --> 44:51.896
The chief carpenter, sir.

44:53.324 --> 44:55.031
You came?

44:55.660 --> 44:57.662
I've been waiting.

44:58.796 --> 45:00.036
Yes, sir.

45:12.877 --> 45:14.356
This way.

45:22.887 --> 45:24.958
Watch your step, sir.

45:31.529 --> 45:32.974
We're here.

45:46.244 --> 45:48.520
I've come a very long way.

45:52.917 --> 45:56.831
The king's future throne...

46:19.277 --> 46:21.348
It's as I expected.

46:24.382 --> 46:26.293
Magnificent!

46:26.617 --> 46:29.598
Mu-ryung Palace is superb!

46:32.156 --> 46:34.329
A great carpenter like you...

46:35.960 --> 46:38.998
will never be matched
in Goryeo's history.

46:42.033 --> 46:43.569
Never.

46:46.003 --> 46:52.045
At the victory banquet,
you said you didn't want a post.

46:52.777 --> 46:54.085
Yes, sir.

46:54.745 --> 46:56.452
Want it.

46:57.415 --> 47:00.453
Seek things with greed.

47:01.218 --> 47:03.664
What will save you in the end...

47:04.255 --> 47:06.132
is your desire.

47:07.224 --> 47:08.532
Yes, sir.

47:10.094 --> 47:11.630
Do you trust me?

47:12.296 --> 47:13.707
Yes, sir!

47:14.665 --> 47:16.508
I don't trust you yet.

47:19.670 --> 47:21.547
Kill LEE Jon-bok.

47:37.054 --> 47:38.761
Who are you!

47:41.792 --> 47:42.998
Stop!

47:48.099 --> 47:49.339
Who are you?

47:49.433 --> 47:50.969
Identify yourself!

47:53.904 --> 47:56.214
I came to meet General LEE Jon-bok.

47:59.877 --> 48:03.723
That wretched bastard!

48:08.119 --> 48:11.931
But why should I listen to you?

48:12.123 --> 48:14.501
Prove you're not lying.

48:16.994 --> 48:18.769
I am the proof, sir.

48:20.831 --> 48:21.969
What?

48:21.999 --> 48:26.345
General Yu-baek ordered
me to kill you, sir.

48:27.571 --> 48:29.141
<i>I'm the assassin.</i>

48:39.817 --> 48:42.764
Go ahead and try.

48:43.320 --> 48:45.459
Will you kill me?

48:47.057 --> 48:48.627
The sword...

48:51.929 --> 48:53.670
I will aim it at him.

49:02.039 --> 49:04.041
Yu-baek ordered the kill...

49:04.074 --> 49:06.680
and promised to make me a colonel.

49:08.512 --> 49:09.684
So?

49:10.014 --> 49:15.623
He can only make me colonel-not a general.

49:17.822 --> 49:20.769
You want to make a deal with me?

49:22.259 --> 49:24.034
Forgive me, sir.

49:27.798 --> 49:29.209
But...

49:29.533 --> 49:33.003
Yu-baek's troops are the best in Goryeo.

49:34.505 --> 49:37.748
Yu-baek is also a master fighter.

49:38.342 --> 49:40.253
How will you beat him?

49:40.845 --> 49:42.882
There is a way...

49:45.516 --> 49:47.826
to kill without the victim ever knowing.

49:48.486 --> 49:52.935
Savages have infiltrated
our territories up north.

49:53.257 --> 49:55.464
The people are suffering.

49:55.826 --> 50:00.206
Elite troops must go quickly
and eradicate this enemy.

50:00.464 --> 50:01.306
But...

50:01.332 --> 50:03.972
Should the royal troops be sent out now...

50:04.368 --> 50:09.044
it may weaken the defense of the capital.

50:09.073 --> 50:13.522
There is a way to eradicate them
without sending the royal troops.

50:13.777 --> 50:17.088
How about sending out
General Yu-baek's troops?

50:17.781 --> 50:20.990
With General Yu-baek in the lead...

50:21.285 --> 50:24.755
troops must be sent north immediately, sir.

50:28.959 --> 50:33.271
When he goes north, he
won't make it back, sir.

50:34.164 --> 50:39.045
How did your father end
up adopting Yu-baek?

50:39.570 --> 50:42.210
Have you heard of the Three Great Swords?

50:42.406 --> 50:43.851
What is that?

50:44.074 --> 50:47.453
It's a group that raised a revolt, sir.

50:48.012 --> 50:51.516
One spark that tried to
burn down the order.

50:51.715 --> 50:55.322
But one of them betrayed the others.

50:56.053 --> 50:57.999
And the fire was extinguished.

50:58.222 --> 51:01.431
That deceiver was Yu-baek.

51:01.458 --> 51:02.801
No...

51:02.826 --> 51:05.864
His name was Duk-gi then.

51:10.234 --> 51:14.740
Let's proceed with your son's
marriage to Princess Hun-hwa.

51:15.973 --> 51:19.580
How about on the day of
Mu-ryung Palace completion?

51:19.610 --> 51:21.521
Thank you, Your Ma...

51:23.714 --> 51:26.092
What's the matter?

51:28.252 --> 51:29.560
I am...

51:32.222 --> 51:34.793
Are you all right, sir? Subjects!

51:39.029 --> 51:41.168
You won't die right away.

51:44.001 --> 51:49.007
How long did your father last? 3 months?

51:49.406 --> 51:51.943
I hope you last that long.

51:52.743 --> 51:58.386
I want you to see everything you created
crumble in my hands.

51:58.882 --> 52:04.332
And see Goryeo placed
completely under my feet.

52:14.098 --> 52:20.913
Do you know when the fire
within me first sparked?

52:23.374 --> 52:24.682
Here.

52:44.461 --> 52:45.963
There!

52:53.404 --> 52:56.874
The father is the most
powerful in the land...

52:58.876 --> 53:01.720
But his son is now a beggar.

53:07.551 --> 53:09.087
Geeze!

53:09.119 --> 53:10.723
Do me a favor.

53:11.722 --> 53:13.497
I want to bathe.

53:17.528 --> 53:18.871
Bathe?

53:19.797 --> 53:21.799
I couldn't believe it.

53:22.933 --> 53:27.973
Hunger is the hardest to bear,
but you wanted to bathe.

53:37.781 --> 53:39.454
It was then.

53:40.317 --> 53:44.732
The awakened man within me whispered...

53:45.789 --> 53:46.995
Look!

53:47.224 --> 53:51.866
People are all born the
same, naked like that.

53:52.796 --> 53:55.470
What that measly fool has...

53:56.033 --> 53:58.877
why didn't you ever covet it?

54:19.957 --> 54:21.664
Want it!

54:22.326 --> 54:23.964
Have it!

54:24.495 --> 54:26.702
Everything you desire...

54:27.598 --> 54:29.305
Have it all!

54:32.736 --> 54:35.148
But for old time's sake...

54:36.740 --> 54:39.619
I've brought the antidote.

55:14.411 --> 55:16.448
No...

55:22.319 --> 55:24.799
Who will own Mu-ryung Palace?

55:26.156 --> 55:29.797
Mu-ryung Palace is mine.

55:37.334 --> 55:38.335
Colonel!

55:38.368 --> 55:40.245
General Yu-baek promised!

55:40.304 --> 55:42.648
This isn't what he promised!

55:42.673 --> 55:44.516
He said to bury any trouble!

55:44.541 --> 55:47.715
What trouble can this little one be'!

55:47.945 --> 55:49.583
Please, sir.

55:49.847 --> 55:51.724
Not my granddaughter!

55:51.748 --> 55:53.421
No one must know his secret!

55:53.550 --> 55:56.156
We won't say anything...

56:26.617 --> 56:28.392
Wait...

57:03.921 --> 57:06.959
A few days after you left, they attacked.

57:08.659 --> 57:10.434
Gam-cho.

57:10.827 --> 57:13.171
They looked for Gam-cho.

57:14.031 --> 57:15.203
Your name?

57:17.868 --> 57:19.176
Gam-cho.

57:20.203 --> 57:21.546
It's Gam-cho!

57:21.738 --> 57:23.240
Gam-cho?

57:24.007 --> 57:26.419
Wol-so fought hard to protect him...

57:27.511 --> 57:30.048
But she got injured too.

57:30.847 --> 57:35.660
I don't know if she's okay or not.

57:36.219 --> 57:39.894
Then where's Gam-cho?

57:42.492 --> 57:43.937
Sir?

57:53.337 --> 57:55.317
No...

57:56.640 --> 57:58.847
No!

58:04.948 --> 58:09.590
"ORDINATION"
All hail Chancellor Yu-baek!

59:08.178 --> 59:11.022
- Assassin!
- Seize him!

59:16.920 --> 59:19.958
He went that way!

59:39.009 --> 59:41.285
- That way!
- Seize him!

59:54.891 --> 59:56.336
Why'd you come here?

59:56.359 --> 59:57.929
I came for Yu-baek.

59:57.961 --> 59:59.941
For what?

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:04.370
No need to know. Just tell me where he is.

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:06.074
That way!

01:00:07.471 --> 01:00:09.246
Do you know or not?

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:48.346
Hold on!

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:50.915
Wait right here.

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:50.909
Hong-yi!

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.543
Sul-rang's sword...

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:21.644
I haven't seen it in years.

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:23.647
Take your filthy hands off it!

01:02:27.777 --> 01:02:29.757
I like the fire in your eyes.

01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:34.551
Are they Pung-chun's eyes?

01:02:39.055 --> 01:02:43.026
You're Hong-yi, the one
who came for my life?

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:44.632
Yes, I am!

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:49.370
I'm Hong-yi, the one who came to kill you!

01:02:55.672 --> 01:02:58.653
You came for me with such measly skills?

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:05.252
How did Sui-rang raise you?

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:30.915
Sui-rang makes the best tea.

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:34.215
Your father always said that, too.

01:03:38.615 --> 01:03:43.758
I wonder why the tea I brew smells fishy.

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:46.094
So fishy.

01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:48.227
Yes...

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:50.969
Sul-rang warned me.

01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:55.038
You'd come for my blood one day.

01:03:56.633 --> 01:03:58.670
But Hong-yi...

01:04:00.637 --> 01:04:02.742
I miss the taste of Sul-rang's tea.

01:04:05.709 --> 01:04:08.781
I long to taste her tea once more.

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.189
For that...

01:04:14.484 --> 01:04:16.794
Before you claim my blood...

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:18.593
Now...

01:04:20.757 --> 01:04:22.964
I have use for yours!

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:27.138
You're not Hong-yi!

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:38.748
Toss her out!

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:06.513
Mom...

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:19.549
Mom...

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.059
Mom...

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:28.826
Hey!

01:05:29.359 --> 01:05:31.839
Wake up!

01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:36.800
Wake up!

01:05:38.001 --> 01:05:40.914
Open your eyes!

01:05:41.838 --> 01:05:44.409
Please...

01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:48.113
Let the blood flow!

01:06:09.933 --> 01:06:12.243
I'm... I'm too late.

01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:17.074
No...

01:06:18.675 --> 01:06:20.677
No!

01:06:23.079 --> 01:06:24.956
My baby!

01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:14.768
Fool...

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:30.252
I warned you to cut off
personal feelings...

01:07:39.923 --> 01:07:41.493
Master...

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:47.666
Go and tell Yu-baek.

01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:51.141
I am Sui-rang!

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:55.911
Sul-rang...

01:07:57.173 --> 01:07:58.550
Sui-rang!

01:08:02.845 --> 01:08:07.089
Do people know how hard
you work to offer them tea'!

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:08.729
It doesn't matter.

01:08:08.952 --> 01:08:11.432
What good is eating grass like this?

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:13.964
They'd be happier with meat.

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:16.468
Of course they'd like that.

01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:20.435
But the best things come
slowly without knowing.

01:08:22.865 --> 01:08:24.867
What a saying!

01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:28.073
'Without knowing'.

01:08:29.339 --> 01:08:31.011
Slowly.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:33.845
Sui-rang?

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:35.219
Hmm?

01:08:35.712 --> 01:08:38.921
That's such a great saying.

01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:41.426
How did you think of that?

01:08:48.323 --> 01:08:50.031
I don't smell anything.

01:08:52.095 --> 01:08:54.200
It's hard to tell like that.

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:11.622
Here.

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:25.598
Good, isn't it?

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:29.002
Wait!

01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:06.804
When I set out to do something...

01:10:08.805 --> 01:10:10.478
For instance...

01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:12.953
If it's my first time...

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:17.354
How will I know if it's right?

01:10:18.848 --> 01:10:21.158
There's only one thing I know.

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:26.563
No matter what it is,
what you do is right, Duk-gi.

01:10:30.293 --> 01:10:31.966
Promise me...

01:10:35.598 --> 01:10:37.737
You won't let me go.

01:10:38.468 --> 01:10:39.879
Yes.

01:10:42.138 --> 01:10:43.845
I promise, Duk-gi.

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:46.016
We've captured Sui-rang.

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:49.348
Sul-rang...

01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:54.627
Sul-rang...

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.308
Stop Yu-baek!

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:22.211
I didn't come to see you.

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.685
I've come to die with you.

01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:54.847
Lock her up.

01:12:01.117 --> 01:12:02.755
Her eyes...

01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:15.871
Master...

01:12:40.923 --> 01:12:42.493
Be strong.

01:12:49.332 --> 01:12:51.369
I know you're awake.

01:12:51.968 --> 01:12:54.346
This old man is tired.

01:12:56.505 --> 01:12:58.712
I'm sleepy and hungry.

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:04.525
Well done, child.

01:13:20.363 --> 01:13:22.673
What are you peeping at?

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:25.975
What are you praying for?

01:13:27.303 --> 01:13:29.146
I prayed for Hong-yi.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:32.317
For her not to be shaken.

01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:34.912
As Pung-chun's only daughter...

01:13:35.278 --> 01:13:37.349
to avenge her father's blood.

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:41.552
And I prayed for myself.

01:13:43.052 --> 01:13:45.396
His blood is on my hands.

01:13:46.389 --> 01:13:50.337
I did the unforgivable.
I couldn't kill you.

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:52.635
I'll never be forgiven for that.

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:55.709
I also prayed for you.

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:59.336
For your internal organs
to be hacked to pieces.

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:03.677
And for that pain to be nothing
compared to your regret.

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:10.380
For you to realize all the sins
you've committed in this world.

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:16.121
Regret?

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:19.323
Regret?

01:14:19.588 --> 01:14:22.068
What a preposterous thing to pray for!

01:14:22.491 --> 01:14:25.028
You're the one who will die in regret.

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:29.667
Pung-chun cared for us
dearly, especially you!

01:14:30.533 --> 01:14:32.513
Pung-chun! Pung-chun!

01:14:32.735 --> 01:14:34.578
Enough about him!

01:14:34.904 --> 01:14:38.511
Why didn't you kill
yourself after killing him?

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:40.915
Why are you still alive?

01:14:40.943 --> 01:14:43.082
Why couldn't you kill me?

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:45.352
<i>Admit it!</i>

01:14:45.915 --> 01:14:48.452
Even if I killed our master...

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:51.988
You can't leave me.

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:54.762
How dare you!

01:14:56.859 --> 01:14:59.305
You can't leave me.

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:02.838
You...

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.575
You can't forget me.

01:15:30.793 --> 01:15:32.670
It wasn't Hong-yi.

01:15:34.964 --> 01:15:36.705
That girl is not Hong-yi.

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:43.214
Her eyes do not resemble
Pung-chun's at all.

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:47.885
Who else would Pung-chun's
daughter resemble?

01:15:48.577 --> 01:15:51.353
And the scar on her back...

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:56.085
It's not from my sword, it's from yours.

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:04.429
You must've taken in an orphan
and raised her as Hong-yi.

01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:11.539
Blinded by greed, that's
what you want to see.

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:18.378
It is regrettable that
you've lost your sight.

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:21.379
I wanted to show you...

01:16:22.011 --> 01:16:26.050
what I have gained and will own.

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:28.754
You must see.

01:16:29.985 --> 01:16:32.261
How I became Yu-baek...

01:16:33.622 --> 01:16:38.594
and will soon marry the princess.

01:16:43.032 --> 01:16:45.376
Then you'll finally feel...

01:16:47.203 --> 01:16:52.676
regret that will last forever.

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:17.008
Does anything cause you pain?

01:17:20.336 --> 01:17:22.577
If so, dispose of it.

01:17:26.509 --> 01:17:29.388
If your tooth hurts, pull it out.

01:17:30.546 --> 01:17:34.585
If your finger hurts, cut it off.

01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:40.229
What is most painful to you...

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:45.438
will make you weak.

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:51.176
Yes, sir.

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:54.510
Same goes for people.

01:17:57.973 --> 01:17:59.748
Remember.

01:18:04.547 --> 01:18:06.686
Mu-ryung Palace is complete.

01:18:07.049 --> 01:18:09.325
Well done, Chancellor.

01:18:09.652 --> 01:18:13.065
I have a request, Your Majesty.

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:14.900
Speak.

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:17.665
Give me Mu-ryung Palace, sir.

01:18:20.963 --> 01:18:22.271
What?

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:25.572
What did you just say?

01:18:25.901 --> 01:18:28.006
Give me Mu-ryung Palace.

01:18:28.837 --> 01:18:31.249
Enough nonsense, Chancellor.

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:37.380
You said Mu-ryung Palace
belongs to Princess Hun-hwa.

01:18:38.614 --> 01:18:42.790
Then give me the Princess, too.

01:18:43.953 --> 01:18:49.062
You dare throw contempt on this court.

01:18:49.758 --> 01:18:52.364
You marrying the Princess?

01:18:52.962 --> 01:18:55.272
You of low birth!

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:58.577
How dare you speak of her!

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:23.528
Such a pity.

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:28.704
Nothing but your temper is left of you.

01:19:31.367 --> 01:19:33.404
What did you just say?

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.013
Born as the son of a king...

01:19:40.042 --> 01:19:44.047
you were spoiled your whole life
without leaving the palace.

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:49.719
You think you can rule the world
without even seeing it.

01:19:50.653 --> 01:19:54.499
That you can rule the people
without even seeing them.

01:19:57.326 --> 01:20:00.705
Those who killed your father
made your brother king.

01:20:01.697 --> 01:20:05.076
Then those who killed him
put you on the throne.

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:08.681
You're just a scarecrow, fool!

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:13.711
Did you really think you owned your life?

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:21.756
Born from a slave,
I, Duk-gi, the lowest of them all...

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:25.465
I'm staring at the one upon the throne.

01:20:26.889 --> 01:20:29.062
Who's the one trembling now?

01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:35.998
Are you my master? Or am I your master?

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:42.044
In trying to marry your daughter,
I may get killed like LEE Jon-bok.

01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:45.152
But at this very moment...

01:20:46.842 --> 01:20:48.685
I am your master.

01:20:50.946 --> 01:20:54.416
Guards! Guards!

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:56.495
You...

01:20:58.153 --> 01:21:00.064
Just kill me now!

01:21:01.156 --> 01:21:03.693
I can kill you at any time.

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:09.473
Still don't get why I'm letting you live'?

01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:39.032
Your Majesty.

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:45.067
Chancellor Yu-baek and
Princess Hun-hwa should be wed.

01:21:45.334 --> 01:21:49.714
The Princess' grand wedding
at Mu-ryung Palace...

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:52.685
will strengthen your reign!

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:55.946
Yes, Your Majesty!

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:40.631
Cool down, kid!

01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:44.462
What use in hitting that?

01:22:45.127 --> 01:22:45.969
What?

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:49.874
Fool! What good is hitting a tree!

01:22:49.932 --> 01:22:51.843
That's what!

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:54.741
You scared the fish away!

01:22:55.337 --> 01:22:57.339
There's nothing to eat.

01:23:01.343 --> 01:23:05.189
In your next life, be born a king.

01:23:08.116 --> 01:23:10.460
Are you really a master swordsman?

01:23:10.486 --> 01:23:11.487
Of course!

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:14.159
I am the 9th Head Master here.

01:23:14.223 --> 01:23:16.601
And the one who taught
the Three Great Swords.

01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:20.038
I'm the master of masters.

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:24.535
The Great Master!

01:23:26.368 --> 01:23:28.473
Ow! My back...

01:24:03.305 --> 01:24:05.080
Do you want to train?

01:24:05.207 --> 01:24:06.311
Yes!

01:24:06.475 --> 01:24:08.113
For what?

01:24:08.343 --> 01:24:10.516
I have vengeance left in my heart.

01:24:13.916 --> 01:24:16.328
Please, sir!

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:19.755
Master?

01:24:20.122 --> 01:24:22.159
Master!

01:24:49.117 --> 01:24:50.255
Take that!

01:24:52.955 --> 01:24:55.060
The sword has a heart.

01:24:56.725 --> 01:24:59.672
It's the heart of the sword's owner.

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:08.339
Thus, the sword has love-and hatred, too.

01:25:23.986 --> 01:25:25.329
UP here!

01:25:53.415 --> 01:25:55.622
She's just like Sui-rang.

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:04.331
If you pass the test...

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:06.933
I'll give you this.

01:26:07.696 --> 01:26:13.169
This is Pung-chun's sword,
the best in all the world.

01:26:14.536 --> 01:26:15.537
Now!

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:17.174
Attack!

01:26:19.808 --> 01:26:21.583
Oh my.

01:26:34.890 --> 01:26:36.494
Go fetch it.

01:26:36.825 --> 01:26:37.860
Pardon?

01:26:37.926 --> 01:26:39.530
Fetch it.

01:26:39.761 --> 01:26:41.365
Bu! There are lots.

01:26:42.764 --> 01:26:44.368
Forget it, then.

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:46.903
Okay! I'll fetch it.

01:26:48.336 --> 01:26:50.680
But keep your promise, sir!

01:27:15.097 --> 01:27:17.099
I like the fire in your eyes.

01:27:17.666 --> 01:27:19.873
Are they Pung-chun's eyes?

01:27:21.336 --> 01:27:22.974
Her eyes...

01:27:23.371 --> 01:27:25.351
Don't resemble Pung-chun's at all.

01:27:25.407 --> 01:27:29.514
Who else would Pung-chun's
daughter resemble?

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:50.636
Found it!

01:28:04.179 --> 01:28:05.624
I found it, sir!

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:08.386
But there's a grave.

01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:25.373
Want to know whose grave it is?

01:28:27.335 --> 01:28:28.541
Yes.

01:28:28.737 --> 01:28:31.149
It'll upset you.

01:28:32.174 --> 01:28:33.949
Still want to know?

01:28:35.544 --> 01:28:37.023
Yes.

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:43.286
Long ago, Sui-rang came to me.

01:28:46.721 --> 01:28:48.632
What are you doing!

01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:51.869
That's forbidden!

01:28:54.763 --> 01:28:56.834
You want to die, too?

01:28:57.966 --> 01:29:00.003
You could lose your eyesight!

01:29:00.035 --> 01:29:02.208
I don't care if I go blind.

01:29:02.237 --> 01:29:04.239
I'll die if I have to.

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:07.077
Please save Hong-yi!

01:29:07.509 --> 01:29:09.455
Hong-yi is already gone.

01:29:09.578 --> 01:29:11.558
No... Master!

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:14.118
Please save Hong-yi!

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:17.723
Please... Bring Hong-yi back!

01:29:22.157 --> 01:29:24.103
Who's the girl?

01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:25.531
Hong-yi.

01:29:25.594 --> 01:29:28.541
Hong-yi is dead! Don't lie!

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:31.806
She didn't die.

01:29:32.667 --> 01:29:37.480
I buried Hong-yi here.

01:29:46.014 --> 01:29:51.726
You're not Hong-yi.
You're Sul-rang's daughter, Sul-hee.

01:29:53.455 --> 01:29:55.662
Master...

01:30:05.367 --> 01:30:06.710
Mum!

01:30:07.469 --> 01:30:08.812
Mum!

01:30:13.041 --> 01:30:15.715
Even if you never see light again...

01:30:17.012 --> 01:30:19.253
this is your retribution.

01:30:22.784 --> 01:30:25.128
I understand, Master.

01:30:28.223 --> 01:30:30.499
Pung-chun knew.

01:30:30.959 --> 01:30:34.532
Even as my sword pierced
him, he trusted me.

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:41.979
'I will let your baby with Duk-gi be born.'

01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:44.680
'But promise me one thing.'

01:30:45.974 --> 01:30:50.582
'Please promise you'll protect Hong-yi.'

01:30:51.947 --> 01:30:53.392
Hong-yi...

01:30:54.082 --> 01:30:56.255
When this baby is born...

01:30:57.419 --> 01:31:02.266
I will name her Hong-yi
and I will raise her...

01:31:05.427 --> 01:31:07.839
Once she's old enough to know...

01:31:08.196 --> 01:31:10.540
I will tell her...

01:31:11.032 --> 01:31:15.071
to kill Sui-rang and Duk-gi,
who killed her parents.

01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:16.378
Sul-rang...

01:31:16.404 --> 01:31:18.645
It's only right.

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:27.917
This is the only reason
to keep my sinful life going.

01:31:41.963 --> 01:31:44.375
My baby, Sul-hee...

01:31:50.839 --> 01:31:53.513
To think of something so horrific...

01:31:54.376 --> 01:31:56.879
Do you despise me that much?

01:32:07.889 --> 01:32:09.835
I will kill you!

01:32:39.087 --> 01:32:40.930
If this is so...

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:43.894
Why!

01:32:46.261 --> 01:32:48.502
Why didn't you hold on to me?

01:32:52.801 --> 01:32:54.803
I couldn't let you go.

01:32:58.673 --> 01:33:00.152
What did you see'?

01:33:02.110 --> 01:33:03.612
Duk-gi?

01:33:07.348 --> 01:33:08.691
That's right.

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:12.891
He is Duk-gi, the man Sui-rang loved.

01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:20.201
You killed him!

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:28.405
The young man I loved.

01:33:31.639 --> 01:33:34.586
You killed the one I'd love even in death.

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:41.123
Even if he should be born again...

01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:44.559
A thousand times!

01:33:44.886 --> 01:33:47.958
He can never be born as Duk-gi again!

01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:52.699
I despise you with my entire life.

01:33:54.529 --> 01:33:57.271
And I'll despise you in death.

01:34:00.668 --> 01:34:05.674
With every last drop of blood
in me, I despise you!

01:34:32.667 --> 01:34:34.408
It won't be long.

01:34:35.069 --> 01:34:38.744
I'll take your life after the wedding.

01:34:39.807 --> 01:34:41.718
Even in death, watch me.

01:34:43.278 --> 01:34:45.519
After killing Duk-gi and
becoming Yu-baek...

01:34:47.882 --> 01:34:51.557
You and I must die. This is our fate.

01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:21.260
I'll never drink tea again.

01:35:22.951 --> 01:35:24.453
Never.

01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:34.635
Sul-hee...

01:35:36.631 --> 01:35:38.633
I'm sorry, Sul-hee.

01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:43.743
I'm sorry.

01:35:50.612 --> 01:35:53.422
The day will come when
you'll feel you're lost.

01:35:56.818 --> 01:35:59.560
Just think about what is right.

01:36:02.423 --> 01:36:04.425
Then you'll see.

01:36:13.067 --> 01:36:15.172
What is right is right for all.

01:36:23.278 --> 01:36:27.852
For those who judge sin and those who pay.

01:36:32.553 --> 01:36:34.897
If feelings get in the way...

01:36:37.058 --> 01:36:42.440
make your sword stronger with them.

01:36:49.137 --> 01:36:54.849
Cutting off personal feelings
is the way of the sword.

01:37:08.456 --> 01:37:13.872
In order to strengthen the court's reign...

01:37:14.429 --> 01:37:17.103
my only daughter, Princess Hun-hwa...

01:37:17.131 --> 01:37:20.669
shall marry Chancellor Yu-baek.

01:37:21.169 --> 01:37:26.983
The wedding will be in 3 days
upon Mu-ryung Palace's completion.

01:37:27.542 --> 01:37:31.388
Prepare the greatest celebration
in the history of Goryeo!

01:37:31.412 --> 01:37:34.086
Long live His Majesty!

01:37:34.349 --> 01:37:36.795
Long live Goryeo!

01:37:36.884 --> 01:37:40.730
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:46.669
Give me the sword.

01:37:46.961 --> 01:37:48.531
Sul-hee...

01:37:48.863 --> 01:37:50.604
It's Hong-yi.

01:37:56.404 --> 01:38:01.854
Since Mother gave birth to me,
I've been Hong-yi.

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:14.757
You're the one who saved Sul-hee.

01:38:17.258 --> 01:38:18.999
Please, come in.

01:38:30.638 --> 01:38:32.584
She is well.

01:38:34.242 --> 01:38:36.552
She'll be here soon.

01:38:37.545 --> 01:38:42.358
Why would you give your life for her?

01:38:47.989 --> 01:38:49.969
It's citron tea.

01:38:50.558 --> 01:38:53.471
It's good, both in scent and taste.

01:39:00.301 --> 01:39:03.009
You must do me one favor.

01:39:04.705 --> 01:39:07.185
Please. Take me to where she is.

01:39:17.118 --> 01:39:20.588
The bride is coming! Quick, prepare!

01:39:31.466 --> 01:39:33.309
Light the lanterns!

01:39:37.238 --> 01:39:40.185
- How old is the Princess?
- 2 years younger than you.

01:39:40.208 --> 01:39:42.848
- We'll live in the palace now?
- Yes.

01:39:44.212 --> 01:39:45.714
Listen!

01:39:48.883 --> 01:39:52.296
Pung-chun's daughter, Hong-yi!

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.596
I've come for Yu-baek's blood!

01:39:55.223 --> 01:39:56.634
Assassin!

01:40:11.239 --> 01:40:12.877
It's an assassin!

01:40:17.912 --> 01:40:19.755
Stop for a moment.

01:40:26.787 --> 01:40:28.289
It's heavy.

01:40:29.056 --> 01:40:30.899
Take my armor off.

01:40:46.007 --> 01:40:47.384
Sul-hee...

01:42:38.619 --> 01:42:40.223
Try. If you dare.

01:42:56.337 --> 01:42:58.010
With this...

01:42:58.973 --> 01:43:01.010
I don't owe you anything.

01:44:02.069 --> 01:44:04.242
That's Pung-chun's sword.

01:44:32.032 --> 01:44:36.572
Are you really Hong-yi?

01:44:40.174 --> 01:44:42.176
Are you afraid?

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:47.791
Come!

01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:53.426
Hong-yi or not, it doesn't matter!

01:46:27.848 --> 01:46:29.191
That's it!

01:46:30.384 --> 01:46:32.955
Put all your anger into your sword.

01:49:56.657 --> 01:49:58.534
Duk-gi...

01:54:35.635 --> 01:54:43.635
"MEMORIES OF THE SWORD"

01:54:47.881 --> 01:54:52.159
"DIRECTED BY PARK Heung-sik."

01:54:53.053 --> 01:54:54.430
Mother?

01:54:54.654 --> 01:54:57.294
What was my father like?

01:54:59.926 --> 01:55:01.803
He was truly...

01:55:03.997 --> 01:55:07.740
He was a daring man who never failed.

01:55:09.236 --> 01:55:10.909
Really?

01:55:12.072 --> 01:55:13.813
What about mom?

01:55:14.174 --> 01:55:16.176
What was she like?

01:55:18.745 --> 01:55:23.524
I wish you were my real morn.

01:55:36.196 --> 01:55:38.676
Did they love each other a lot?

01:55:39.099 --> 01:55:43.172
Tell me how my mother
and father loved each other.

01:55:43.503 --> 01:55:45.574
Please?

01:55:46.873 --> 01:55:51.219
Your morn...
she truly loved your father's smile.

01:55:51.878 --> 01:55:53.915
His smile?

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:55.616
Yes.

01:55:56.049 --> 01:56:01.624
Such an innocent smile.
She loved it more than the flowers.

01:56:02.556 --> 01:56:04.297
She loved him so.

01:56:05.305 --> 01:56:11.223
