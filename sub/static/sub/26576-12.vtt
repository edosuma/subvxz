WEBVTT

00:00.380 --> 00:04.400
Arthur, your blood
pressure is 160 over 100.

00:04.470 --> 00:06.600
160 out of 100?

00:06.680 --> 00:09.440
- That's awesome!
- 160 over 100.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.110
It's not awesome; it's hypertension.

00:12.120 --> 00:13.400
Oh.

00:13.460 --> 00:14.979
Have you been stressed lately?

00:14.980 --> 00:17.180
Unemployment? A death in the family?

00:17.190 --> 00:18.620
Mommy issues?

00:18.660 --> 00:20.690
Ohh.

00:20.700 --> 00:22.110
Yep.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.320
This makes sense.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.050
You know what? It's
almost Valentine's Day.

00:25.060 --> 00:28.000
- And?
- My wife has very high expectations.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.130
Last year, I did the
classic "scavenger hunt

00:30.140 --> 00:32.009
that led to finding her
birth parents" thing,

00:32.020 --> 00:33.320
and this year I have to top it.

00:33.350 --> 00:36.660
It cannot be a letdown!
No letdowns for Camille!

00:41.460 --> 00:42.800
Is "Dranderson" a heart med?

00:42.810 --> 00:43.820
No.

00:43.830 --> 00:46.780
Dr. Anderson is a couples' counselor.

00:46.790 --> 00:47.830
Call her.

01:09.370 --> 01:10.980
Weird you're getting Lena a gift.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.400
Really cool wrapping paper, though.

01:13.410 --> 01:15.599
What? No, Milo has a
birthday party this weekend.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.479
- Oh.
- Hey, you know what's great

01:17.480 --> 01:18.690
about being divorced?

01:18.700 --> 01:22.139
Valentine's Day is tomorrow,
and that means nothing to me.

01:22.140 --> 01:24.960
I am off the hook...
no cards, no flowers,

01:24.980 --> 01:27.520
no jewelry that she's going
to immediately return

01:27.530 --> 01:30.440
because, what... what, owl
earrings "aren't her thing"?

01:32.480 --> 01:34.880
Hey, you okay?

01:34.900 --> 01:35.920
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.600
Oh, I'm fine.

01:37.620 --> 01:39.380
I have this blood-pressure situation.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.690
I can't see out of my left
eye, but other than that...

01:41.700 --> 01:43.200
Oh, man, what's stressing you out?

01:43.240 --> 01:44.760
According to my doctor?

01:44.800 --> 01:46.690
- It's Camille.
- Ah, man.

01:46.850 --> 01:48.300
Apparently, she's bad for my health.

01:48.310 --> 01:50.630
He gave me a number for
a couples' counselor.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.500
I should just burn it before
Camille checks my pockets.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.520
Uh, maybe you should call it.

01:54.540 --> 01:55.980
Listen to your doctor, dude.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.440
Camille loves you, okay,

01:57.470 --> 01:59.280
and I'm sure she'll be open to therapy

01:59.300 --> 02:01.970
if that's what you guys need.

02:01.980 --> 02:04.630
Would you have been open to therapy?

02:04.640 --> 02:05.780
What do I have to do with anything?

02:05.800 --> 02:07.340
You were the Camille of your marriage.

02:07.350 --> 02:08.720
As I am the Lena of mine.

02:08.740 --> 02:10.259
What?! No.

02:10.270 --> 02:11.780
You've never noticed that?

02:11.800 --> 02:12.920
You're such a Camille!

02:12.980 --> 02:15.600
Anyway, therapy's a
non-starter for you types.

02:15.610 --> 02:16.900
Well, you could at least ask her

02:16.920 --> 02:19.819
to cut you a break on
Valentine's Day, right?

02:19.820 --> 02:21.620
Okay, totally. I will.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.140
Maybe I'll ask in a note.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.680
Can you please write it for me?

02:28.690 --> 02:30.890
How close is your
handwriting to Helvetica?

02:30.900 --> 02:32.280
It's the only font she'll read.

02:33.980 --> 02:36.020
Okay, all you mommies-to-be,

02:36.030 --> 02:37.460
the more at peace you feel,

02:37.480 --> 02:39.250
the better your baby's gonna feel,

02:39.280 --> 02:41.770
so let's ease back into mountain pose.

02:41.800 --> 02:42.890
Oh, my God.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.890
This is exercise?

02:44.900 --> 02:47.420
I burn more calories
cutting Arthur's steak.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.800
Oh, go to hell.

02:48.820 --> 02:51.140
So, Maya, what are you and
Mean Gene doing tomorrow?

02:51.150 --> 02:52.850
Oh, he's out of town.

02:52.860 --> 02:54.810
Uh, The Verve Pipe is on tour?

02:54.820 --> 02:57.140
So it's just me and, uh, bebe,

02:57.150 --> 03:01.220
home alone, watching my
celebrity crush, Gordon Ramsey.

03:01.230 --> 03:03.060
I know it's weird. I blame the hormones.

03:03.070 --> 03:05.170
- It's not weird.
- Gordon can get it.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.600
What about you, Camille?

03:06.610 --> 03:08.050
You and Arthur have something

03:08.080 --> 03:10.060
spectacular planned for tomorrow?

03:10.070 --> 03:11.900
I'd assume so.

03:11.980 --> 03:14.620
Ooh, I wonder if my
passport's up to date.

03:14.690 --> 03:17.180
I was thinking of doing
something for Martin.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.280
What?

03:18.290 --> 03:19.890
You're gonna do something for Martin?

03:19.920 --> 03:20.980
Yeah.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.560
I mean, I know we're
not together anymore,

03:22.570 --> 03:25.180
but I still love him, obviously...

03:29.110 --> 03:30.180
What?

03:30.190 --> 03:31.560
Come on, you guys.

03:31.570 --> 03:34.880
I mean, we were married for 16 years.

03:34.900 --> 03:36.780
Of course I still love him.

03:36.840 --> 03:39.640
It would be weird if I didn't love him.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.500
I was thinking of making rack of lamb.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.640
Oh, I could destroy a
rack of lamb right now.

03:44.650 --> 03:46.620
Rack of Lamb is not a casual dish.

03:46.640 --> 03:49.520
It's a dish that says we
once loved each other,

03:49.540 --> 03:50.600
we still love each other,

03:50.610 --> 03:52.750
and despite everything
we've been through...

03:52.780 --> 03:54.400
... our love remains unbroken.

03:55.530 --> 03:57.420
When served with peas.

04:09.270 --> 04:10.720
This is for you.

04:10.730 --> 04:12.240
Aha!

04:12.360 --> 04:15.920
Let the V-Day Games begin.

04:15.980 --> 04:17.690
Is this a tiny, little treasure map?

04:19.180 --> 04:22.680
"Camille, I love you to
the ends of the Earth,

04:22.700 --> 04:25.190
but can that just be enough this year?"

04:27.120 --> 04:28.340
I don't get the clue.

04:28.380 --> 04:31.540
There isn't one. It's just...

04:31.600 --> 04:32.980
I've been putting a lot
of pressure on myself

04:33.000 --> 04:34.380
about the holiday.

04:34.420 --> 04:35.440
It's really taking a toll.

04:35.470 --> 04:36.840
A toll!

04:36.920 --> 04:39.900
What tolls do we take to
the ends of the Earth?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.720
Camille.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.100
I saw my doctor.

04:45.130 --> 04:46.480
I didn't schedule that.

04:46.540 --> 04:47.620
I wasn't feeling well.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.440
He's concerned about my health.

04:49.500 --> 04:50.640
He gave me a number of a...

04:50.660 --> 04:52.220
A what, Arthur? A-A heart guy?

04:52.250 --> 04:53.660
A brain guy? A butt guy?

04:54.270 --> 04:57.220
A couples' guy. A counselor.

04:58.200 --> 05:03.070
So you think that you're
sick... because of me?

05:06.100 --> 05:08.380
I can't sleep. I'm losing my hair.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.900
I'm getting nosebleeds at work.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.139
People think I'm doing coke.

05:11.140 --> 05:12.400
They keep asking me for coke.

05:12.420 --> 05:13.480
I don't have any coke!

05:13.560 --> 05:14.999
What does that have to do with me?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.740
Everything has to do with you!

05:16.750 --> 05:18.360
My whole life revolves around you!

05:18.450 --> 05:20.100
It's not working for me!

05:21.120 --> 05:25.380
Sweetie, is it possible
that this pent-up rage

05:25.400 --> 05:27.210
is actually just shame

05:27.220 --> 05:29.280
because you haven't
gotten my present yet?

05:29.300 --> 05:32.440
Because if so, I will
accept a gift card.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.580
- Just this once.
- You know what?

05:34.600 --> 05:36.480
I'm leaving, and I'm
taking the dog with me.

05:37.980 --> 05:39.620
The dog stays.

05:39.650 --> 05:40.779
Come on, Grand Mal!

05:40.780 --> 05:41.900
Grand Mal, stay there, baby.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.340
- Daddy's not going anywhere...
- Come on, girl! Come on, girl!

05:43.360 --> 05:45.420
- ... and even if he was, he doesn't know about...
- Daddy's for sure going somewhere.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.580
- ... your dietary restrictions...
- C'mon, Granny. I love you!

05:46.600 --> 05:49.400
- ... so it's best to stay put!
- Come to Daddy. Come with me. Come on.

05:50.820 --> 05:53.220
Great! You triggered her narcolepsy.

06:01.470 --> 06:02.510
- Hey, Mom?
- Hmm?

06:02.520 --> 06:03.680
I need rain boots.

06:03.700 --> 06:05.860
We have a field trip to a bog next week.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.440
Didn't you guys already go to a marsh?

06:07.450 --> 06:10.100
Yes. And now we're going to a bog.

06:14.310 --> 06:16.670
What you cooking? Smells good in there.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.260
Hey, thanks.

06:18.370 --> 06:20.450
Hey, so, tomorrow is V-Day,

06:20.460 --> 06:21.960
and the kids are going
to that school dance,

06:21.980 --> 06:24.210
so I thought I could make a
nice dinner for the two of us,

06:24.220 --> 06:27.290
you know, so you don't
have to eat out of a bag.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.980
You want to have dinner with me?

06:31.030 --> 06:33.650
Well, I just thought it would
be a nice way to say thanks.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.690
You've been a really
amazing partner lately.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.600
Partner?

06:38.640 --> 06:41.000
Co-parent? Roommate? Whatever.

06:41.100 --> 06:44.640
I was just thinking it would
be, you know, a nice,

06:44.670 --> 06:46.600
casual dinner between two friends

06:46.620 --> 06:48.740
who got nuthin' but love for each other.

06:50.300 --> 06:51.360
What?

06:51.420 --> 06:53.700
Would you stop it?

06:53.720 --> 06:57.070
We obviously still love one another.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.450
What are you doing?

06:59.460 --> 07:01.200
What are you doing?

07:01.230 --> 07:02.270
What are you doing?

07:02.290 --> 07:04.310
You are making it weird.

07:04.320 --> 07:07.260
Come on. You know I love you.

07:07.270 --> 07:08.320
No, I don't.

07:08.490 --> 07:09.750
I tell you all the time.

07:09.780 --> 07:11.160
You do not.

07:11.410 --> 07:13.440
Okay, well, then I'm saying it now, bro.

07:13.450 --> 07:15.400
You wanna hammer some lamb
with me tomorrow or not?

07:15.410 --> 07:17.620
Yeah, man. Let's hammer a lamb, brah.

07:17.630 --> 07:19.150
- I'm in.
- Good.

07:19.160 --> 07:21.240
All right, well, it's
super casual, all right?

07:21.260 --> 07:23.059
- Très caj.
- Okay.

07:23.060 --> 07:24.340
I might even wear sweats.

07:30.430 --> 07:32.170
Hey, buddy.

07:32.180 --> 07:33.520
I'm gonna crash here for a bit.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.910
I took your advice, and
I stood up to Camille.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.980
And then we got in a huge fight.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.820
I was gonna go to a hotel,

07:40.830 --> 07:43.540
but there's no telling what
I might do if left alone.

07:45.080 --> 07:48.460
Now I'm kind of curious.
Should we try and find out?

07:51.720 --> 07:52.930
Fresh pepper?

07:56.590 --> 07:58.480
- Fresh pepper?
- Mnh-mnh.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.050
Freshly ground pepper?

08:03.060 --> 08:04.520
- Sure.
- Great.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.250
Arthur, stop.

08:09.170 --> 08:11.780
Sit down. Just relax.

08:11.910 --> 08:13.440
You're right. I'm so sorry, baby.

08:13.450 --> 08:14.700
- "Baby"?
- Reflex!

08:14.720 --> 08:17.270
Sorry, Camille. No, I'm
not sorry, Camille.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.660
There, I fixed it.

08:20.730 --> 08:22.740
- Hey, no phones at the table.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

08:22.760 --> 08:25.040
I'm just planning a Valentine's
Day flash mob for Bronwyn.

08:25.050 --> 08:27.760
Oh, I flash-mobbed Camille in '07.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.420
It went viral.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.200
We were on "Good Morning America."

08:32.260 --> 08:33.429
How was your day, baby?

08:33.429 --> 08:34.840
Not too shabby.

08:34.900 --> 08:37.080
I received eight Scooby-Doo
cards from girls

08:37.100 --> 08:38.480
who hold no charm for me.

08:38.500 --> 08:41.200
Also, whom is "Scooby-Doo"?

08:41.270 --> 08:43.539
He's a cartoon dog who solves mysteries.

08:43.630 --> 08:46.000
Now that I'd be interested in.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.250
Thanks again for dinner!

08:47.260 --> 08:49.380
- Oh, hey, Martin.
- Hmm?

08:49.420 --> 08:50.840
Aren't you forgetting something?

08:50.850 --> 08:52.580
What, compost? I thought
we gave up on that.

08:52.660 --> 08:54.670
Not compost.

08:57.820 --> 08:59.480
Him?

08:59.730 --> 09:01.430
No, he can't come with me to the garage.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.780
We both won't fit in there.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.160
- Yeah, I'm more of a house guy.
- Yeah.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.060
Yeah, the house is
where this kid shines.

09:07.070 --> 09:08.710
They're called "houseguests"
for a reason.

09:11.340 --> 09:12.680
Fine, one night.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.630
Two nights, tops.

09:17.100 --> 09:19.780
Three nights, if you're still
super-duper sad like that.

09:21.070 --> 09:22.280
Stop looking at me.

09:23.380 --> 09:24.560
Nice work.

09:27.140 --> 09:28.780
I miss you, Auntie.

09:28.830 --> 09:30.910
Aww, I miss you too, Gun-Woo.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.360
Where's Uncle Arthur?

09:32.370 --> 09:34.660
Presumably at a Marriott?

09:34.670 --> 09:36.920
Gorging himself on Frosted
Flakes or whatever

09:36.940 --> 09:39.060
they make available at those
type of establishments.

09:39.070 --> 09:42.240
We had an argument.

09:42.280 --> 09:44.110
We may reconcile, we may not.

09:44.120 --> 09:47.820
But until then, everything he
owns in a box to the left.

09:48.070 --> 09:49.400
I'm worried about you, Auntie.

09:49.410 --> 09:50.640
Who's gonna take care of you?

09:50.680 --> 09:53.840
Well, I take care of myself, of course.

09:53.850 --> 09:55.500
You must not know 'bout me.

09:55.520 --> 09:56.890
Stop quoting Beyoncé.

09:57.980 --> 09:59.710
Uncle Arthur did everything for you.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.350
I-I mean, y-you looked out for him, too.

10:01.390 --> 10:03.260
That's why y'all were
the perfect couple.

10:03.270 --> 10:06.200
Mkay, good night,
Gun-Woo! So many kisses!

10:07.470 --> 10:09.100
It's still lunchtime here, Auntie...

10:13.750 --> 10:16.000
No turndown service.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.180
No chocolate mint?

10:21.950 --> 10:23.160
What the...

10:32.400 --> 10:34.180
Candy?

10:34.190 --> 10:35.560
Noice.

10:35.570 --> 10:38.020
Here, you can have mine, too.

10:38.030 --> 10:39.500
Noice!

10:39.520 --> 10:41.360
Hey, you guys want me to read you

10:41.380 --> 10:43.300
Chrissy Teigen's tweets
while you fall asleep?

10:43.410 --> 10:45.060
That's what I do for Camille.

10:45.070 --> 10:46.650
I'm all set.

10:46.660 --> 10:47.730
I'd love it.

10:47.740 --> 10:48.940
Yeah?

10:48.950 --> 10:50.920
Please.

10:50.970 --> 10:53.600
So, where were we?

10:53.630 --> 10:55.000
Ah, yes.

10:55.030 --> 10:58.040
"Sometimes I get legit upset
that I'm not Italian."

10:58.090 --> 11:00.830
- Same, Chrissy. Same.
- Same, Chrissy. Same.

11:03.910 --> 11:07.620
Same, Chrissy. Same.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.000
Who the... ?

11:21.780 --> 11:24.240
Arthur, are you using my laptop?

11:24.250 --> 11:25.660
I'm just backing up your files,

11:25.680 --> 11:27.700
making sure everything
is saved to the cloud,

11:27.720 --> 11:29.480
just in case you spill a glass of Pinot.

11:29.530 --> 11:30.940
- I don't have any Pin...
- I bought you some Pinot.

11:30.950 --> 11:32.360
It's chilling in the wine fridge.

11:32.370 --> 11:34.360
- I don't have a wine...
- I bought you a wine fridge.

11:34.390 --> 11:36.260
Wow!

11:36.270 --> 11:39.170
That was really thoughtful.

11:39.180 --> 11:41.660
You're sure making yourself
useful around here.

11:41.710 --> 11:43.490
My work day starts at 11:00,

11:43.500 --> 11:46.360
but my housework commences at sunrise.

11:46.370 --> 11:47.660
I did the dishes,

11:47.680 --> 11:50.840
I did the laundry, ooh, I made the beds.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.440
I waxed and washed your car.

11:53.470 --> 11:55.100
Holy crap! Arthur,

11:55.180 --> 11:57.980
I didn't even notice you
doing any of those things.

11:58.020 --> 12:00.640
Yeah, Camille hates
watching me do chores.

12:00.650 --> 12:03.470
I think she feels guilty
for not doing any herself.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.660
Therefore, there's really
only one solution.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.160
That she pitch in and help?

12:07.210 --> 12:10.680
No. That I train myself to
do everything silently.

12:10.860 --> 12:13.490
Out of view. In the shadows.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.200
Like a ninja.

12:15.230 --> 12:17.740
Well, I'm gonna get
myself a second cup of...

12:19.100 --> 12:20.360
Damn.

12:20.380 --> 12:21.580
Am I a good boy?

12:21.730 --> 12:23.550
Such a good boy.

12:28.810 --> 12:30.520
"Caj," huh?

12:30.560 --> 12:32.840
- I knew it.
- Ta-da!

12:32.850 --> 12:35.050
Hey.

12:35.060 --> 12:37.130
Oh, wow, that looks...

12:37.140 --> 12:38.780
Yummers!

12:38.980 --> 12:41.060
We having a little "lonely
hearts" dinner for three?

12:41.210 --> 12:43.740
Arthur! I thought you had plans.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.239
Yeah, I was gonna watch "Sommersby"

12:45.240 --> 12:47.980
and cry on the couch, but your
Internet's a little laggy.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.320
Did you try restarting?

12:49.330 --> 12:50.480
Yeah, tried that.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.580
- Close out all your apps?
- Uh-huh.

12:54.500 --> 12:57.760
Ohh, two place settings.

12:57.780 --> 12:59.360
I gotcha.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.210
Message received. That's embarrassing.

13:01.220 --> 13:02.790
Hey, hey. No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.920
What message are you receiving, exactly?

13:04.930 --> 13:06.800
Because I've been told
this is a casual dinner.

13:06.810 --> 13:07.959
"Très caj," even.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.580
100%.

13:09.670 --> 13:11.820
So it's cool if Arthur joins us.

13:11.860 --> 13:13.580
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.580
Pull up a chair. Très caj à trois.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.759
Okay. Don't mind if moi do.

13:21.180 --> 13:24.590
So, you're looking very
nice tonight, Lena.

13:24.660 --> 13:27.380
Got all dolled up for an old friend.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.700
Guess all your sweatpants were dirty.

13:29.720 --> 13:32.160
They were. This was the
only thing I had clean.

13:32.170 --> 13:33.400
I just did a load of laundry, though.

13:33.420 --> 13:35.160
- It's over there...
- Didn't see it.

13:35.170 --> 13:37.520
Martin, you look very handsome tonight.

13:37.540 --> 13:39.740
- Thank you.
- I love the brand-new jeans.

13:39.750 --> 13:41.140
What, these? No.

13:41.170 --> 13:43.560
No, I-I've had these.
These are o-old jeans.

13:43.690 --> 13:46.430
Oh, they still have the sticker.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.620
Wow! Look at that.

13:48.980 --> 13:50.379
That's been on there for

13:50.380 --> 13:52.260
probably like 10 years, huh?

13:52.280 --> 13:54.860
- Oh!
- That's embarrassing.

13:57.030 --> 13:59.500
All this flirty banter is
making me miss Camille.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.770
Thank you for sort-of
inviting me for dinner,

14:02.780 --> 14:05.270
but if you need me, I'll be upstairs

14:05.280 --> 14:06.920
re-insulating your attic.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.160
I can't find him anywhere.

14:16.220 --> 14:18.920
He wasn't at Pilates nor Nobu

14:19.030 --> 14:21.520
nor the women's section at Barneys,

14:21.530 --> 14:23.100
nor the women's section at Neiman's.

14:23.120 --> 14:26.210
Were you just looking for him in
places you were already going?

14:26.260 --> 14:27.740
Well, that's where he always is.

14:29.170 --> 14:31.080
Relax, Camille.

14:31.090 --> 14:32.400
Arthur's fine.

14:32.450 --> 14:34.500
Is that so? You seem quite certain.

14:34.530 --> 14:36.940
Okay, he's been staying here.

14:36.950 --> 14:37.980
I should have told you.

14:37.990 --> 14:39.160
Told me?!

14:39.200 --> 14:41.360
Asked you? That doesn't sound right.

14:41.370 --> 14:42.480
It is!

14:43.860 --> 14:46.280
Look, the four of us are friends.

14:46.290 --> 14:47.960
It's complicated.

14:48.030 --> 14:49.960
And for the record, this is how I felt

14:49.970 --> 14:51.460
when you were hanging
out with Lisa Apple.

14:51.470 --> 14:54.260
Oh! You two are divorced.
It's different.

14:54.280 --> 14:55.680
Well, is that where you're heading?

14:56.090 --> 14:57.670
What are the games you're playing here?

14:57.700 --> 14:59.460
Arthur is a good boy.

14:59.470 --> 15:02.460
Okay, I hope you're not handing
those out too liberally.

15:02.470 --> 15:04.760
You need to ration those.
Make him work for them.

15:04.880 --> 15:08.230
I know you don't like feeling
vulnerable, Camille,

15:08.240 --> 15:10.760
but just admit it. You need him.

15:11.020 --> 15:13.829
If anything, it's Grand Mal
who's the one that's a wreck.

15:13.830 --> 15:14.839
Mm.

15:14.840 --> 15:16.770
I caught her standing
next to an open window,

15:16.800 --> 15:19.470
and she was definitely
weighing her options.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.000
How is he?

15:24.130 --> 15:26.660
- If only so I can tell the dog.
- Great.

15:26.670 --> 15:29.520
I mean, he's miserable,
but he's amazing.

15:29.540 --> 15:31.300
I had no idea what a little
treasure you had at home.

15:31.340 --> 15:33.200
- Had.
- Yeah, I said "had."

15:33.240 --> 15:34.710
Oh.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.960
Relationships are give and take.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.860
Arthur loves to give,

15:38.910 --> 15:42.180
so maybe you can just take
it a little easier on him.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.600
Or I could give him something.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.420
I don't think that's
the solution to his...

15:47.430 --> 15:49.460
I could give him one thing!

15:49.800 --> 15:50.840
Perfect.

15:53.970 --> 15:55.880
Wee! Ta-da!

15:55.890 --> 15:58.090
Wow! Great job, buddy!

15:58.100 --> 15:59.700
Let me see you do it again!

15:59.720 --> 16:01.470
Hey, look! It's the Jaspers!

16:01.480 --> 16:02.900
Hey, Milo.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.900
All right, share the ball, guys.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.500
Oh, hey. I'm Arthur.

16:09.530 --> 16:11.340
I think I met you at
Milo's birthday party.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.820
Oh, right, yeah.

16:12.830 --> 16:15.020
Uh, you're his, uh, godfather
or something, right?

16:15.100 --> 16:16.700
I don't think so?

16:16.720 --> 16:18.940
I would know if I was, right?

16:19.310 --> 16:20.670
Maybe I should make a play for it.

16:22.100 --> 16:23.940
So, uh, how is she?

16:24.370 --> 16:26.360
- Camille?
- Who?

16:26.370 --> 16:27.980
No, I'm talking about Maya.

16:28.020 --> 16:29.030
Maya.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.360
Yeah, she was my girl.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.640
Wait a second.

16:33.150 --> 16:36.320
You're Sugar Beard. AKA
Country Music Face!

16:36.730 --> 16:38.480
- Dang, boy.
- What?

16:39.420 --> 16:41.540
Yeah, I wasn't sure I'd ever

16:41.560 --> 16:43.030
hear those nicknames again.

16:44.260 --> 16:45.840
She quit me.

16:46.870 --> 16:48.910
Camille quit me, too.

16:49.020 --> 16:51.010
Or I quit her? Either way, we're quit.

16:51.020 --> 16:52.920
And I'm trying to be patient.

16:52.930 --> 16:55.100
You know, Maya's an Earth sign,
so the last thing she needs

16:55.120 --> 16:57.120
is pressure, but... but
I'm all fire, you know?

16:57.140 --> 16:58.300
I do know!

16:58.310 --> 17:01.460
Yeah, I mean, we... we
can only be who we are.

17:01.470 --> 17:03.420
And I'm the man who loves her.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.170
Okay, seriously?

17:05.180 --> 17:06.319
I just got chills,

17:06.369 --> 17:07.630
and you and I both have to remember...

17:07.640 --> 17:09.099
Jasper! Jasper!

17:09.119 --> 17:10.530
Jas... Watch it, please?

17:10.540 --> 17:13.519
If you fall, you get
hurt, I've got nothing!

17:13.520 --> 17:15.020
Nothing!

17:15.160 --> 17:16.780
Good to see you.

17:19.690 --> 17:20.810
Thanks for letting me help you

17:20.819 --> 17:23.180
with this commemorative scrapbook.

17:23.190 --> 17:25.599
It's nice to have an outlet for my love.

17:25.619 --> 17:28.439
How much longer are you
stalkers gonna be in my room?

17:28.440 --> 17:30.550
If you would just let us
take the craft bin...

17:30.580 --> 17:32.060
The craft bin stays.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.810
"Feels Like Yesterday:
Memories of Two Days Ago."

17:37.820 --> 17:38.970
Bronwyn's gonna love it.

17:38.980 --> 17:40.420
I hope she does.

17:40.490 --> 17:42.260
And I hope she appreciates you, Mason,

17:42.320 --> 17:44.300
'cause nothing feels worse than...

17:45.330 --> 17:49.480
♪ Feelings, so deep in my feelings ♪

17:49.520 --> 17:52.740
♪ No, this ain't really like me ♪

I'm not your uncle! Get out of the way!

18:13.560 --> 18:17.040
♪ Get me high like you do, yeah, yeah ♪

18:22.220 --> 18:23.890
You like that song, right?

18:23.900 --> 18:25.310
I really do!

18:25.320 --> 18:27.940
I remember it was playing at a CVS.

18:28.020 --> 18:29.280
And... And you said you liked it.

18:29.310 --> 18:30.800
That's right. I did!

18:30.810 --> 18:32.050
I remembered that.

18:32.060 --> 18:35.880
I remembered that, and I
retained that information.

18:35.890 --> 18:37.170
For you!

18:37.180 --> 18:39.720
That's above and beyond, baby.

18:39.790 --> 18:42.990
And I'm so sorry that I whiffed
on Valentine's Day this year.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.360
As long as we're apologizing,
I'm sorry that I whiffed on

18:46.370 --> 18:47.960
every Valentine's Day since we met.

18:47.980 --> 18:50.700
- Okay.
- And if you want to go to therapy...

18:50.720 --> 18:51.950
I don't.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.410
I don't want anyone else to judge us.

18:53.420 --> 18:55.320
We are perfect just the way we are.

18:55.380 --> 18:57.620
Let's never talk to
anyone else ever again.

18:57.640 --> 18:58.900
Just each other.

18:58.940 --> 19:00.300
- And our phones!
- And our phones!

19:02.030 --> 19:03.180
Can I drive?

19:03.200 --> 19:04.460
- No.
- Great.

19:08.900 --> 19:10.569
Hey, Mae?

19:10.570 --> 19:12.139
What day is the bog?

19:12.140 --> 19:13.300
Monday, why?

19:13.310 --> 19:15.590
Okay, I'll rush-order the boots.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.080
Already got 'em.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.560
Where'd those come from?

19:18.570 --> 19:20.700
Dad. Cute, right?

19:21.210 --> 19:22.840
Yeah.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.040
Did you get Mae boots?

19:34.060 --> 19:35.780
Uh, yeah, sorry, is that okay?

19:35.800 --> 19:37.900
Yeah, it's okay. Thank you.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.200
Why are you thanking me?

19:40.210 --> 19:41.720
I didn't get you boots.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.030
Yeah, that's true.

19:44.040 --> 19:46.150
Now I just have to get
a present for, um...

19:46.180 --> 19:47.199
Jacob's birthday?

19:47.200 --> 19:48.280
- Yeah.
- Dunzo.

19:48.300 --> 19:50.300
I got him Garmadon's Lair.

19:50.330 --> 19:53.240
521 pieces. He's gonna be stoked.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.450
Wow.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.160
That one wasn't even on the board.

19:57.170 --> 19:58.950
Yeah, what can I say?

19:58.960 --> 20:00.120
I'm on it.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.120
See? This is why I love you.
