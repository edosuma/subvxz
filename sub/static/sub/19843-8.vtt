WEBVTT

00:40.950 --> 00:42.326
You know what to 0'0.

00:43.580 --> 00:44.660
Hey, it's Danny.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.496
You need to leave
your mum's place right now.

00:47.290 --> 00:48.871
Gao may be sending
people to hurt you.

00:49.590 --> 00:51.455
Call me or Colleen _
as soon as you get thIs.

01:18.570 --> 01:19.571
Harold?

01:50.980 --> 01:52.436
Shh.

02:00.660 --> 02:02.321
Okay. Okay.

02:13.750 --> 02:16.503
- The hell is wrong with you?
- I thought you were one of them.

02:17.050 --> 02:18.711
- One of who?
- The Hand.

02:19.050 --> 02:22.178
What are you talking about?

02:23.220 --> 02:24.710
What are you even doing here?

02:28.270 --> 02:29.305
Where's Dad?

02:34.980 --> 02:36.356
I think you should sit down.

02:37.280 --> 02:38.736
Oh, for Christ's sake.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.446
Something terrible
has happened to your father.

02:42.660 --> 02:44.366
What?

02:44.660 --> 02:46.241
He ran out of chia seeds?

02:49.750 --> 02:51.035
You don't wanna go in there.

03:23.780 --> 03:24.826
Why?

03:26.830 --> 03:27.865
Because of me.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.166
I tried to warn him, but...

03:32.960 --> 03:33.949
I was too late.

03:35.710 --> 03:36.836
What did you do?

03:38.380 --> 03:40.336
I refused to back down from Gao.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.255
I thought if I destroyed her labs...

03:46.060 --> 03:47.095
That she'd what?

03:48.390 --> 03:50.130
Take her ball and go home?

03:52.390 --> 03:53.891
Are you a moron?

03:54.310 --> 03:56.767
You thought you could end
a criminal conspiracy

03:56.940 --> 03:59.022
by destroying
a few test tubes?

03:59.530 --> 04:00.645
I thought I could handle it.

04:02.490 --> 04:03.525
Well, now,

04:03.820 --> 04:07.483
I need to mourn my father's death
for the second time.

04:10.790 --> 04:12.405
I didn't know what I was up against.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.069
I see that now.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.796
I'm not gonna let her hurt
anyone else. I promise.

04:22.260 --> 04:23.830
I know where she's going.
I'm gonna find her.

04:24.010 --> 04:25.966
I don't give
a shit what you do.

04:26.470 --> 04:29.052
Just stay the hell away
from me and Joy.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.469
I'm sorry.

04:33.810 --> 04:35.516
You're a cancer, Danny.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.255
I'm going to China.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.256
This factory, it's in Anzhou.

06:32.930 --> 06:35.967
It's where we were headed
when my plane crashed.

06:37.020 --> 06:40.012
My father, he...
he never visited the foreign sites.

06:40.310 --> 06:42.187
He must've suspected
something was going on.

06:42.980 --> 06:43.969
Heroin?

06:44.980 --> 06:46.607
Maybe Gao found
out he was onto her.

06:47.110 --> 06:48.771
You think she did
something to the plane?

06:49.410 --> 06:52.231
All I know is that Gao punishes people
who try to fight her.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.191
If I wanna find the truth,
then I have to find her.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.689
What if she won't talk?

06:59.250 --> 07:00.239
She'll talk.

07:02.670 --> 07:03.659
Okay.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.083
Have you stopped to consider
that this idea totally sucks?

07:07.510 --> 07:09.296
It doesn't suck, okay?

07:10.010 --> 07:11.250
Kinda harsh, Claire.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.629
Not really.

07:13.390 --> 07:18.555
For all you know, you're walking into
a trap in Angjo... Anjao...

07:18.730 --> 07:21.221
- Anzhou.
- Anzhou. Right.

07:22.860 --> 07:25.932
What if Gao just said that she knew
your father so you'd take the bait?

07:26.650 --> 07:27.981
Maybe they never even met.

07:29.190 --> 07:32.273
You can't believe anything
that she says to you.

07:33.530 --> 07:34.827
Look, that may be true.

07:35.950 --> 07:37.440
But if there's even
the smallest chance

07:37.540 --> 07:39.451
that I can find out the truth,
then I have to go.

07:39.540 --> 07:41.861
Otherwise,
it's just gonna be this cloud

07:42.370 --> 07:44.122
hanging over me for the rest of my life.

07:44.460 --> 07:46.872
Well there is no rest of your life
if she kills you.

07:48.920 --> 07:52.333
I've seen someone
else take on the Hand.

07:53.470 --> 07:54.710
It didn't end well.

07:55.010 --> 07:57.843
I appreciate your concern,
but I've already made up my mind.

07:58.680 --> 08:00.557
I'm sorry I dragged you both
into my fight,

08:00.730 --> 08:04.018
but hopefully, this trip will end
the Hand's story in all of our lives.

08:04.650 --> 08:05.935
I'm going with you.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.355
No, you're not.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.448
Last time you tried to take on
the Hand alone, you got beaten to shit.

08:14.030 --> 08:15.110
You need me.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.036
The Hand will be looking for us.

08:24.750 --> 08:27.537
Claire, do not come up for air
until you hear from us.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.547
I'm going, too.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.546
This isn't just your fight, Danny.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.671
They came at me in my home.

08:36.930 --> 08:39.421
They attacked my hospital.
They killed my friend.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.886
I don't want you guys
in any more danger.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.384
The Hand thrives on fear.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.897
I can't keep running.

08:47.940 --> 08:49.180
I have to do this.

08:51.070 --> 08:52.105
For Louisa.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.480
For myself.

09:01.790 --> 09:03.405
So, what's the plan?

09:06.790 --> 09:07.950
I'm gonna track her down.

09:08.630 --> 09:10.951
I'm gonna take her by surprise.
I'm gonna grab her.

09:14.420 --> 09:15.466
Grab her?

09:16.430 --> 09:18.637
And then what? Do we take her
to the Chinese authorities?

09:18.800 --> 09:20.506
Uh... Interpol?

09:21.140 --> 09:23.301
I hope you're not planning on
bringing her back here, are you?

09:23.480 --> 09:26.222
- That's gonna be one awkward-ass flight.
- Look, I don't know, okay?

09:26.520 --> 09:29.057
It's a long way to China.
I'll figure it out before we get there.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.568
If you don't trust me,
then don't come.

09:40.780 --> 09:41.781
I'm sorry.

09:42.540 --> 09:43.575
It's all right.

09:45.290 --> 09:48.202
I'm not sure there is a graceful way
to handle this.

10:04.930 --> 10:07.842
Can I get anyone anything
before we get started?

10:08.230 --> 10:09.219
Coffee?

10:09.690 --> 10:11.681
We have a new
espresso machine.

10:12.480 --> 10:13.720
Cut the theatrics, Lawrence.

10:13.900 --> 10:16.107
Let's get this over with
so we can pack our offices.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.356
Oh, your things
have already been packed...

10:19.160 --> 10:21.867
uh, minus any Rand property,
of course.

10:22.370 --> 10:23.985
The boxes will
be released to you

10:24.160 --> 10:26.958
as soon as you sign
your termination agreements.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.781
You're holding our
knickknacks hostage?

10:30.040 --> 10:31.450
They're not just stuff, Ward.

10:31.670 --> 10:34.628
I have things that can't be replaced...
photos of Mum and Dad.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.929
As I said, your mementos
are a pen stroke away.

10:39.510 --> 10:43.594
I think you'll find the severance
to be more than generous.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.216
A hundred million each.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.351
That's exactly what we offered Danny.

10:52.690 --> 10:54.226
Ironic, isn't it?

10:54.690 --> 10:56.601
Enjoy this while you can.

10:57.570 --> 11:01.313
When I'm on the other side of this table,
I guarantee you won't be smiling.

11:02.740 --> 11:05.368
You have no one to blame
but each other.

11:06.080 --> 11:09.789
Bringing Danny into this company
was a toxic decision.

11:10.290 --> 11:12.702
Thankfully, we didn't give him
a job title,

11:12.880 --> 11:15.667
so we don't have to
offer hIm severance.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.831
A silver lining.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.923
Danny may have cost this company
a few dollars,

11:21.260 --> 11:25.549
but he more than made up for it by
improving the public's perception of Rand.

11:26.430 --> 11:28.091
The stock will rebound.

11:28.930 --> 11:31.262
He bought
a warehouse and a pier for no...

11:31.850 --> 11:33.431
discernible reason...

11:33.860 --> 11:36.977
and refused to settle
the class action suit.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.816
It was becoming a pattern.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.270
_ This deal
IS non-negotiable.

11:43.280 --> 11:46.078
And you both have to sign,
or you both get nothing.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.689
Ward...

11:49.500 --> 11:50.956
you mind joining
us for a second?

11:52.460 --> 11:53.449
Hmm?

11:54.540 --> 11:56.997
I said you both have
to sign, or no deal.

11:59.720 --> 12:00.789
Got a pen?

12:01.800 --> 12:04.542
Can we have a moment alone?

12:06.100 --> 12:07.715
Take all the time you need.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.259
"Got a pen?"

12:18.440 --> 12:21.273
I didn't think pencil
would be legally binding.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.315
How could...

12:23.660 --> 12:26.823
How could you even consider signing this
without discussing it with me?

12:28.580 --> 12:33.165
Our options are the Fort Knox
of golden parachutes or nothing.

12:33.830 --> 12:35.661
Seems like an obvious decision.

12:37.630 --> 12:40.007
How many back pills
have you taken today?

12:41.630 --> 12:44.428
Is it really that hard to believe
that I'm okay with this?

12:45.140 --> 12:46.255
Actually, yes, it is.

12:46.550 --> 12:48.711
You know, not too long ago,
you were fighting like a rabid animal

12:48.890 --> 12:51.131
to keep Danny from taking away
control of this company.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.055
You know...

12:57.270 --> 13:01.229
I've been thinking a lot lately about
that last summer in the Hamptons with Dad.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.940
Do you remember...

13:06.360 --> 13:08.863
what you said you wanted
to be when you grew up?

13:09.990 --> 13:11.491
What does that have
to do with anything?

13:13.120 --> 13:14.280
A horse breeder.

13:15.210 --> 13:17.326
It was all you talked about.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.331
I wonder sometimes,

13:22.510 --> 13:25.718
if Dad hadn't tied our inheritance
to our jobs at Rand, then...

13:26.680 --> 13:28.887
maybe you'd be running
a horse farm right now.

13:30.680 --> 13:31.806
'Course I wouldn't.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.339
I was 12 years old.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.220
It was a stupid daydream.

13:36.850 --> 13:39.307
Maybe so,
but it was your daydream...

13:40.190 --> 13:41.316
not Dad's.

13:43.530 --> 13:45.100
This is our chance to...

13:46.200 --> 13:48.862
stop living the life that he...

13:50.330 --> 13:52.480
prescribed for us and...

13:54.080 --> 13:55.365
write our own destiny.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.320
I'll admit...

13:59.670 --> 14:02.377
...working at Rand
wouldn't have been my first choice.

14:03.170 --> 14:04.250
Exactly.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.256
I was just out of law school.

14:07.590 --> 14:09.296
No one here took me seriously.

14:09.930 --> 14:11.295
They had every right not to.

14:12.180 --> 14:14.762
The job just didn't come naturally to me
like it did for you.

14:15.680 --> 14:19.935
So I... worked my ass off
to learn this business.

14:21.230 --> 14:23.812
And then, I... I won the respect
of my colleagues.

14:24.990 --> 14:25.979
And, yes...

14:27.200 --> 14:28.849
part of me wants to stay because...

14:29.910 --> 14:31.446
I feel connected to Dad...

14:33.450 --> 14:35.441
but the other part
wants to stay for me.

14:36.580 --> 14:37.956
For what I achieved.

14:40.210 --> 14:41.746
I earned my position.

14:42.420 --> 14:44.240
I'm not gonna just walk away.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.040
Not without a fight.

14:46.260 --> 14:49.002
Joy, this isn't a fight we can win.

14:49.130 --> 14:51.792
Well, that may not be true.

14:53.970 --> 14:57.224
If... If I can put together
a solid strategy,

14:57.770 --> 14:58.930
will you at least consider it?

15:00.980 --> 15:02.049
Okay.

15:03.150 --> 15:07.189
But only if you give serious thought
to accepting the settlement.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.275
Deal.

15:57.120 --> 16:00.078
Blackalicious, BDP...

16:00.660 --> 16:01.820
Big Pun?

16:02.870 --> 16:04.622
Wow. Old school.

16:05.170 --> 16:06.740
I've had it since I was ten.

16:07.210 --> 16:09.292
You must've been
a pretty gangsta ten-year-old.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.260
So what's going on
with you and Miss Thang?

16:28.190 --> 16:29.350
Colleen?

16:31.150 --> 16:32.230
What about her?

16:34.410 --> 16:35.559
You know what I mean.

16:39.330 --> 16:40.399
Wow.

16:41.410 --> 16:42.570
That good, huh?

16:45.500 --> 16:47.081
A gentleman never
kisses and tells.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.371
You don't have to say anything.
It's written all over your face.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.330
"Danny Rand got some."

17:06.520 --> 17:07.680
What about you?

17:08.860 --> 17:09.929
You got a boyfriend?

17:11.530 --> 17:12.645
Nope.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.612
I've seen you reread that letter
at least three times since we took off.

17:18.990 --> 17:20.946
The handwriting
is distinctly not feminine.

17:22.330 --> 17:23.786
He'll be glad to hear that.

17:26.330 --> 17:27.490
"He" is?

17:29.790 --> 17:31.246
Presently unavailable.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.460
Danny, I want to ask you something.

17:38.010 --> 17:38.999
Sure.

17:41.970 --> 17:43.517
If you find out...

17:44.310 --> 17:46.722
that Gao indeed did
kill your parents...

17:47.770 --> 17:50.603
um, you're not gonna do
anything stupid, right?

17:51.730 --> 17:53.937
Like what? Kill her?

17:55.030 --> 17:56.395
For example.

17:57.610 --> 17:58.986
I've spent the last 15 years

17:59.160 --> 18:02.118
learning to control my body,
my mind and my emotions.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.116
I think I'll be okay.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.086
But ifI did kill her...

18:12.300 --> 18:14.541
I would only be fulfilling my duty
as the Iron Fist.

18:15.340 --> 18:17.296
Oh, you really think
that you can justify murder?

18:17.680 --> 18:20.717
I swore to protect the people of K'un-Lun
from the Hand. Okay?

18:21.140 --> 18:25.804
Killing... is wrong,
no matter who pulls the trigger or why.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.557
I wonder if you'd feel the same way
if someone killed your mother and father.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.396
"An eye for an eye
makes the whole world blind."

18:41.160 --> 18:45.073
It's an easy opinion to have...
when you're not the Iron Fist.

18:51.540 --> 18:53.997
I think Gandhi
might disagree with you.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.007
Okay, I'm not special...

19:02.720 --> 19:06.679
but I've seen enough people die
to understand the value of a life.

19:08.310 --> 19:10.301
What about all the lives
that Gao destroys?

19:16.230 --> 19:17.527
Hey...

19:21.070 --> 19:23.231
Turbulence is scary,
but it's not dangerous.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.406
In fact, it's...

19:26.540 --> 19:28.826
- totally normal, actually...
- When flying over mountains?

19:29.000 --> 19:30.206
I know.

19:30.420 --> 19:33.287
My mum told me the same thing right before
she was ripped out of our plane.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.626
Shit. Sorry, I... I didn't know.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.375
Look, my head knows the facts,

19:39.550 --> 19:41.336
but, right now,
my heart is doing the driving.

19:41.510 --> 19:42.795
Okay, then forget the facts.

19:43.090 --> 19:45.046
Okay, just... Let's...
Tell us how you feel.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.518
Say everything that's going
through your head. Just let it out

19:49.730 --> 19:51.800
I can't breathe.

19:53.190 --> 19:55.567
Yes, you can.
You just feel like you can't.

19:55.730 --> 19:57.140
You just need to focus
on something else.

19:57.610 --> 19:59.146
Start talking.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.646
Okay.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.199
There was turbulence. Just like this.

20:04.410 --> 20:08.232
We were... We were flying over mountains.
It was... It was bad.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.912
- There was lightning.
- Good. Keep going.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.753
The plane, it started to fall apart.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.210
Something hit me in the head.

20:23.590 --> 20:26.502
My mum, she...
she came to see if I was okay.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.709
Then the roof was gone.

20:30.310 --> 20:32.596
Then, my mum... she was gone.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.891
My dad, he told me
he loved me, and then...

20:37.570 --> 20:39.060
then everything went white.

20:39.320 --> 20:40.685
What happened next?

20:43.150 --> 20:44.606
Mum! Mum!

20:44.820 --> 20:46.776
It’s gonna be okay.

20:47.370 --> 20:48.405
Stay in your seat.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.729
Heather!

20:49.910 --> 20:51.446
We got you, Danny.

20:53.080 --> 20:54.786
Dao’!

20:55.250 --> 20:56.740
I love you, Danny!

20:58.170 --> 20:59.956
How did you feel
when you saw the monks?

21:00.210 --> 21:02.508
Imkwh.

21:03.260 --> 21:05.831
Good. Just focus on that feeling.

21:06.930 --> 21:07.965
Okay?

21:08.680 --> 21:12.468
You're as _safe now
as you were With them then.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.105
Just keep breathing.

21:26.320 --> 21:27.651
You're gonna be okay.

21:46.840 --> 21:47.886
Ward.

21:48.590 --> 21:49.750
How did you get up here?

21:49.930 --> 21:53.058
Oh, I'm not universally despised
in this building.

21:53.220 --> 21:54.221
Not yet, anyway.

21:55.020 --> 21:58.399
We'll have to see about making
some changes in our security personnel.

21:59.270 --> 22:01.101
I don't want to cause trouble for anyone.

22:02.150 --> 22:03.640
I just want
a moment of your time.

22:04.110 --> 22:05.941
I don't know what there is to discuss.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.157
Joy and I are at an impasse.

22:10.410 --> 22:12.981
I'm ready to sign,
but she wants to fight.

22:13.750 --> 22:17.322
And I don't think we'll be able
to reach an agreement either way.

22:17.830 --> 22:23.245
So I'm here to ask that my severance
be independent of Joy's.

22:24.090 --> 22:25.250
I see.

22:26.220 --> 22:29.758
I know that a lot of effort went into
drafting the InItIal agreement,

22:29.930 --> 22:36.221
so I would be willing to accept
a significant... decrease...

22:37.060 --> 22:38.436
to make it worth your while.

22:38.810 --> 22:39.799
Interesting.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.016
Did you have a number in mind?

22:42.610 --> 22:43.725
Thirty million dollars.

22:45.230 --> 22:48.063
I'll sign right now.
You never have to see my face again.

22:51.620 --> 22:56.569
I realise... that you will have
to eat some crow...

22:57.210 --> 22:58.609
with the rest of the board.

22:59.080 --> 23:05.167
So... Iwould be willing
to compensate you for that.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.461
How does half a million sound?

23:10.470 --> 23:12.006
I don't know what to say, Ward.

23:13.600 --> 23:14.635
How about "yes"?

23:17.730 --> 23:19.015
Your father would be ashamed

23:19.190 --> 23:21.977
if he could see the way
his family was falling apart.

23:27.610 --> 23:31.489
All due respect, Lawrence,
you don't know shit about my father.

23:33.660 --> 23:35.070
Do you want the money or not?

23:36.290 --> 23:37.530
There is no money.

23:37.910 --> 23:38.899
Of course, there is.

23:39.250 --> 23:41.366
The offer doesn't expire
for another two days.

23:41.580 --> 23:42.820
Oh, it didn't expire.

23:43.670 --> 23:44.739
It was rejected.

23:45.210 --> 23:46.245
The hell it was.

23:47.170 --> 23:48.205
By who?

23:52.180 --> 23:53.169
VVhen?

23:53.680 --> 23:55.341
She called less
than an hour ago.

24:02.190 --> 24:03.680
Joy didn't consult me...

24:04.650 --> 24:06.470
and she certainly
doesn't speak for me.

24:09.530 --> 24:11.646
I'm asking you, as a favour.

24:16.660 --> 24:17.900
It's too late.

24:29.550 --> 24:31.290
It's a shame how
things turned out.

24:31.880 --> 24:34.337
Well, you get to be
the hero who rights the ship.

24:34.550 --> 24:35.539
No.

24:35.720 --> 24:39.304
I'm talking about you and your sister
working against each other.

24:39.890 --> 24:41.972
And over what, huh?
A little money?

24:43.940 --> 24:47.512
I always thought the two of you
looked after one another.

24:48.480 --> 24:49.811
In fact, I envied it.

24:51.820 --> 24:53.481
I'm sorry to see I was wrong.

25:34.860 --> 25:36.236
You worried Gao won't turn up?

25:37.780 --> 25:39.020
It's the waiting.

25:40.740 --> 25:41.786
It's hard.

25:49.290 --> 25:50.416
About your mum...

25:54.260 --> 25:55.295
It's okay.

25:56.260 --> 25:57.579
You don't have to say anything.

25:59.300 --> 26:00.460
I know.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.845
I just wanted to.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.221
I watched my mum die, too.

26:11.980 --> 26:13.561
Only, I didn't know it at the time.

26:15.740 --> 26:16.889
I was young, and...

26:18.110 --> 26:20.237
my dad didn't really
talk to me about it.

26:22.330 --> 26:24.321
He wasn't really great with other people.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.742
One day,
she was just gone and...

26:30.000 --> 26:31.581
I didn't know what
had happened to her.

26:34.590 --> 26:36.797
It wasn't until years later
that I realised she was sick.

26:41.180 --> 26:42.306
I'm sorry.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.683
Afterwards, my dad sent me to live
with my grandfather in Japan, but...

26:49.690 --> 26:51.100
I always felt kinda...

26:53.480 --> 26:54.606
I don't know.

26:56.030 --> 26:57.145
Abandoned.

27:01.490 --> 27:04.152
It doesn't matter how much
anyone else cares for you.

27:07.330 --> 27:08.456
It's not the same.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.911
Part of me is sorry
you understand that.

27:14.380 --> 27:17.042
And the rest?

27:18.550 --> 27:19.926
Is glad I found you.

27:25.510 --> 27:26.920
Anything?

27:27.730 --> 27:28.765
Um...

27:29.810 --> 27:31.095
Yeah, there's, uh...

27:31.350 --> 27:33.056
There's been a few
guards that have, uh...

27:33.900 --> 27:35.515
...that have gone by.

27:36.150 --> 27:37.856
The big building's where
they're making the heroin.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.947
We saw some workers being herded in
a few hours ago.

27:41.990 --> 27:43.946
Maybe we shouldn't stay
in one place for too long.

27:44.410 --> 27:45.616
In case they have
guards patrolling.

27:46.080 --> 27:47.149
No one's come by yet.

27:47.410 --> 27:50.618
Plus, there's not really a lot
of prime surveillance spots round here.

27:52.210 --> 27:53.529
You know what?
I'm done waiting.

27:54.170 --> 27:55.740
I'm gonna grab that guard
and give him a choice.

27:56.130 --> 27:57.620
Talk or bleed.

27:59.590 --> 28:01.376
- Um...
- I have a better idea.

28:05.430 --> 28:06.556
Give me your wallet.

28:28.910 --> 28:29.945
Thank you.

28:31.290 --> 28:32.325
You speak English?

28:32.620 --> 28:34.497
I was not born
a homeless beggar.

28:35.960 --> 28:37.200
Right. Sorry.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.677
Most people
usually keep moving.

28:43.840 --> 28:44.920
I need information...

28:45.640 --> 28:49.132
about the factory, the guards,
and the woman who runs it, Gao.

28:50.220 --> 28:51.221
I can pay.

28:52.100 --> 28:53.226
The only fool...

28:54.310 --> 28:57.689
bigger than one seeking information
about that witch...

28:58.570 --> 29:00.390
is the fool willing to provide it.

29:03.490 --> 29:05.151
I'd rather be
a fool than a coward.

29:06.820 --> 29:08.617
If you know how
dangerous Gao is,

29:08.990 --> 29:10.946
this is your chance
to do something about it.

29:11.540 --> 29:13.656
Do you really believe
you can stop her?

29:13.830 --> 29:15.536
I believe someone has to try.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.916
Then ask me your questions.

29:23.010 --> 29:24.250
Heel, Toro, heel.

29:29.350 --> 29:30.419
Hey.

29:30.850 --> 29:32.340
Hey, what are you doing out here?

29:32.520 --> 29:33.760
The hell were you thinking?

29:33.930 --> 29:36.398
You_ turned down the severance
wrthout even talking to me?

29:36.600 --> 29:38.682
- You talked to Lawrence?
- You're goddamn right I did.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.021
You tried to cut a deal
behind my back, didn't you?

29:41.110 --> 29:43.351
I could've gotten us
both what we wanted.

29:43.570 --> 29:44.946
How could you do this to me?

29:45.240 --> 29:46.605
I did this for you.

29:47.780 --> 29:49.441
I know how to get our jobs back.

29:49.620 --> 29:53.112
They voted us out, Joy.
And they did it by the numbers.

29:53.290 --> 29:54.780
We don't have a leg to stand on.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.957
I'm not talking
about a legal loophole.

29:57.540 --> 29:58.700
What else is there?

30:01.460 --> 30:03.667
Oh, you're not thinking
of using Danny, are you?

30:04.130 --> 30:06.872
Exploiting his
corporate crusader image?

30:07.050 --> 30:08.836
Exposing the board
for wanting to oust us,

30:09.010 --> 30:11.387
because we_ wanted
to stop ponsoning people?

30:11.560 --> 30:14.802
I'm sorry, but that is
a profoundly stupid idea.

30:15.140 --> 30:16.516
You can't keep him in line.

30:16.690 --> 30:19.932
Every time he opens his mouth,
he digs you deeper into the hole.

30:23.900 --> 30:24.935
What's this?

30:25.530 --> 30:26.519
The way back.

30:43.550 --> 30:44.585
Jesus.

30:55.770 --> 30:57.931
- Is this real?
- Fortunately.

30:59.270 --> 31:01.010
Half our board
is either screwing the company

31:01.190 --> 31:02.760
or someone who's not their spouse.

31:04.940 --> 31:07.522
You couldn't put this much dirt
together overnight.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.349
Where did you get this?

31:09.570 --> 31:11.982
I hired a private investigator
a while ago to start digging.

31:13.240 --> 31:16.368
She was worth every penny...
when she was sober.

31:17.870 --> 31:19.918
I didn't mention it the other day
because I wasn't sure

31:20.080 --> 31:21.820
I was ready to do something like this.

31:24.040 --> 31:25.246
I don't know what to say.

31:25.460 --> 31:28.668
I can't believe you'd even consider
doing something like this.

31:29.430 --> 31:30.920
_I'm not the one who
painted us Into this corner.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.591
I'm just trying to find a way out.

31:33.180 --> 31:36.764
Are you suggesting that I'm somehow
responsible for this shitty scheme?

31:39.060 --> 31:40.721
I've known for a while that you...

31:41.600 --> 31:44.398
indulged in the extra back pill.

31:46.860 --> 31:48.566
You always seemed to have it
under control.

31:49.900 --> 31:52.528
But I wanted the file in case
it ever caused problems at Rand.

31:53.370 --> 31:56.988
And this wasn't a problem for you
until it was a problem for Rand?

31:58.580 --> 31:59.706
Jesus, Joy.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.991
Are you my sister or my HR rep?

32:02.170 --> 32:03.706
Honestly?

32:04.750 --> 32:05.910
I don't know.

32:08.050 --> 32:10.757
Well, when was the last time we talked
about anything other than work?

32:12.680 --> 32:13.886
That's bullshit.

32:15.140 --> 32:16.801
Can you name
the last person I dated?

32:19.520 --> 32:22.341
I have... I just have no idea
who you've been seeing,

32:22.440 --> 32:24.226
or what you've been reading, or...

32:25.360 --> 32:28.227
anything about your life
outside of Rand.

32:31.150 --> 32:32.481
We didn't used to be like this.

32:36.530 --> 32:39.784
One day, you just put up a wall,
and I never understood why.

32:41.370 --> 32:42.496
Did I do something?

32:46.500 --> 32:47.910
I was protecting you.

32:48.250 --> 32:50.298
From what?

32:51.510 --> 32:53.375
Ward, I love you. Please.

32:54.680 --> 32:58.468
There is nothing that you could say
that would ever change that.

32:59.060 --> 33:00.129
Do you understand?

33:01.680 --> 33:04.228
Whatever it is. Okay?

33:04.730 --> 33:05.719
Just tell me.

33:15.570 --> 33:16.559
I can't.

33:25.540 --> 33:28.703
Well then, I guess I'll just tell you
something I've been keeping from you.

33:30.090 --> 33:31.580
Something else, you mean?

33:35.760 --> 33:37.546
You're the person I most admire.

33:38.550 --> 33:39.710
Come on.

33:40.760 --> 33:41.966
I mean it.

33:42.730 --> 33:46.348
I don't know anyone
as brilliant or as fearless.

33:48.190 --> 33:51.102
You come up with these crazy ideas.
And you stand your ground,

33:51.280 --> 33:53.396
even when _the entire board
trIes to fight you on It.

33:53.940 --> 33:57.273
And then you prove them wrong
every single time.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.109
Joy...

33:59.620 --> 34:02.487
I hired that PI because I thought
it was something you would do.

34:03.120 --> 34:05.532
Maybe it was just stupid of me
to think I could fight on your level.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.950
I'm not the person you think I am.

34:13.630 --> 34:16.758
Everything that you admire about me,
that's not me.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.596
That's all lies. I...

34:33.400 --> 34:34.560
I'm done with lies.

34:38.240 --> 34:39.525
You deserve to know.

34:41.410 --> 34:42.479
Know what?

34:44.160 --> 34:45.195
Everything.

34:47.750 --> 34:49.365
She's keeping those people enslaved.

34:50.380 --> 34:51.665
We have to do something.

34:52.460 --> 34:53.586
The beggar.

34:54.090 --> 34:56.502
He said they leave for their evening meal
around now, right?

34:58.300 --> 35:00.086
As soon as the building's empty,
we'll sneak in,

35:00.260 --> 35:01.670
and we'll burn it to the ground.

35:02.850 --> 35:05.717
Wait. Sorry. You really think
it's a good idea to torch the one place

35:05.890 --> 35:06.925
we know Gao might show up?

35:07.140 --> 35:09.893
Well, what better way to smoke 'em out
than with a fire?

35:19.280 --> 35:21.191
Okay, they're leaving.

35:23.700 --> 35:26.112
Maybe I should hang back
and keep watch

35:26.330 --> 35:27.786
while y'all are inside.

35:29.210 --> 35:30.199
Sounds good.

35:33.460 --> 35:34.449
You ready?

35:34.630 --> 35:35.665
All set.

36:47.700 --> 36:49.531
That looks like
the tattoo on your chest.

36:50.950 --> 36:52.577
How are you connected to these people?

36:52.750 --> 36:53.739
I'm not.

36:54.420 --> 36:56.206
It's a sacred
symbol from K'un-Lun.

36:57.210 --> 36:59.872
Gao's giving them the finger
by putting it on her poison.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.376
Let's find something to start the fire.

37:10.810 --> 37:13.472
Are you really planning
to capture Gao?

37:14.560 --> 37:16.801
Look, can we
not get into that right now?

37:17.310 --> 37:18.811
Let's finish up and get out of here.

37:20.150 --> 37:21.606
I just wanted to say...

37:22.740 --> 37:24.810
Gao is gonna keep destroying
people's lives.

37:25.490 --> 37:27.811
It doesn't matter how it happens,
just as long as it does.

37:32.410 --> 37:34.458
I'm not sure what's
gonna happen, but...

37:34.830 --> 37:36.570
if Gao had anything to do
with my parents' death,

37:36.750 --> 37:38.240
then I'm gonna rip her apart.

37:40.840 --> 37:41.955
It scares me.

37:42.420 --> 37:43.830
Because you're not in control?

37:45.840 --> 37:47.000
Exactly.

37:47.720 --> 37:48.880
I know the feeling.

37:50.890 --> 37:51.925
You do?

37:52.810 --> 37:55.847
When I'm in the fight club,
I'm beating the shit out of people.

37:56.690 --> 37:58.180
I'm completely out of control.

37:58.860 --> 38:00.396
I have no idea what I'm doing.

38:01.650 --> 38:04.699
And this from someone who has
always been In complete control.

38:06.360 --> 38:07.440
So what happened?

38:07.740 --> 38:09.276
I met you.

38:13.830 --> 38:15.036
So it's my fault?

38:15.830 --> 38:17.320
Everything's your fault.

38:21.630 --> 38:22.949
Hey, Claire.

38:25.090 --> 38:27.046
How was your trip to China?

38:28.470 --> 38:31.382
Oh, you know...
We committed arson, and then...

38:33.350 --> 38:34.977
got killed by an evil ninja cult.

38:35.180 --> 38:38.308
It was great.
What'd you do this weekend?

38:53.080 --> 38:54.069
Shit!

38:58.870 --> 39:00.371
It's Claire. Let's go.

39:12.890 --> 39:14.175
Sounds like a warning.

39:16.100 --> 39:19.092
The villagers aren't stupid enough
to trespass here.

39:19.270 --> 39:22.854
I suspect our guests
may be from a bit further away.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.509
Go and find out.

39:41.630 --> 39:43.916
Find Claire.
I'm gonna go after Gao.

39:44.130 --> 39:45.449
She's expecting you.

39:46.130 --> 39:48.712
We should stick together, find Claire,
and then figure out what to do.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.666
Hey,
Zhou Cheng, wake up.

40:25.630 --> 40:27.746
Open the door.

42:12.360 --> 42:13.987
You okay?

42:14.740 --> 42:16.776
I've almost been killed
three times this week.

42:16.950 --> 42:20.158
So no, Colleen, I'd say
I'm pretty frigging far from okay.

42:20.830 --> 42:22.320
I mean, are you hurt?

42:22.620 --> 42:24.281
No, but you are.

42:25.250 --> 42:26.319
It's nothing.

42:26.540 --> 42:27.609
Where's Danny?

42:28.000 --> 42:29.376
He went after Gao.

42:29.630 --> 42:31.700
- Alone?
- Yeah.

42:32.880 --> 42:35.508
He'll be fine.
At least that's what he said.

42:54.820 --> 42:56.139
Asshole.

42:56.440 --> 42:59.238
What are you doing?

43:00.820 --> 43:02.822
I need to get into this building,
and you're in my way.

43:05.330 --> 43:07.150
Maybe you could
finish your nap elsewhere?

43:09.580 --> 43:13.334
I'm quite comfortable here.
Yeah?

43:13.550 --> 43:15.541
Oh, you could try
to make me move...

43:16.300 --> 43:18.507
but I wouldn't advise it.

43:20.300 --> 43:21.847
I don't want to have to fight you.

43:22.140 --> 43:25.928
I'm Zhou Cheng.

43:26.810 --> 43:29.597
Disciple of my master,
Ch'i-Lin.

43:29.980 --> 43:31.516
Sworn defender of the Hand.

43:34.690 --> 43:35.725
Ah!

43:35.900 --> 43:37.982
And what would your master think
about you drinking so much?

43:38.150 --> 43:40.152
Oh, he insists upon it.

43:40.450 --> 43:45.149
You see, uh, some, right...
chase the dragon.

43:45.830 --> 43:47.695
I've gotta keep mine sedated.

43:48.710 --> 43:50.951
Bad things happen if I don't.

43:52.920 --> 43:57.004
But if we're gonna fight,
let's get on with it.

44:23.910 --> 44:25.025
Care for a taste?

44:46.930 --> 44:51.094
I thought the Iron Fist
was a great warrior.

44:52.020 --> 44:54.477
You fight like
a child throwing a tantrum.

44:57.020 --> 45:00.069
A man fights with his mouth
when his fists are lacking.

45:30.470 --> 45:32.973
You think you're better than me?

45:33.890 --> 45:35.938
In a certain regard, you are.

45:37.770 --> 45:41.183
Your haircut for example,
very nice.

45:51.490 --> 45:54.209
But we both swore an _oath
of loyalty and protection.

45:54.500 --> 45:55.990
Your masters are murderers.

46:22.150 --> 46:23.640
Hmm?Hmm?

46:52.220 --> 46:55.269
Our paths diverge
in a different place.

46:56.480 --> 47:00.018
But unlike you,
I've remained true to my vow.

47:01.310 --> 47:03.642
I'm here to stop the greatest threat
to my people.

47:03.860 --> 47:05.020
No, you're not.

47:05.400 --> 47:07.448
You're here to punish,
not protect!

47:09.490 --> 47:11.867
You're wearing
your oath like a mask.

47:12.200 --> 47:14.327
Tell me, Iron Fist...

47:16.330 --> 47:17.900
where's the honour in that?

47:52.160 --> 47:53.445
Danny, stop!

48:02.250 --> 48:03.740
Jesus, Danny.

48:08.260 --> 48:10.831
- Is he okay?
- Does he look okay?

48:17.390 --> 48:18.971
- What is this place?
- You'll see.

48:20.390 --> 48:21.470
Why are you
being so mysterious?

48:21.640 --> 48:23.346
I want you to know everything
I've been keeping from you.

48:23.520 --> 48:25.977
But unless you see it with your own eyes,
you may not believe me.

48:28.190 --> 48:31.193
What I'm about to show you
is shocking, but it...

48:37.040 --> 48:38.029
What's wrong?

48:38.830 --> 48:40.195
No, no, no, no, no.

48:40.370 --> 48:42.702
I can't... I can't be here.

48:44.170 --> 48:45.376
What the hell is going on?

48:48.210 --> 48:49.199
Hey.

48:49.590 --> 48:51.797
Talk to me, Ward. Please.

48:52.010 --> 48:53.637
You're scaring
the shit out of me.

48:58.680 --> 48:59.886
Why did you bring me here?

49:00.520 --> 49:02.181
Is this where your
drug dealer lives?

49:03.810 --> 49:04.799
Ward?

49:11.860 --> 49:12.895
Hey.

49:26.460 --> 49:28.337
What are you doing? Come on.

49:28.500 --> 49:30.548
No. Not till you explain this.

49:31.550 --> 49:33.962
The truth is...

49:34.130 --> 49:36.837
I'm having financial trouble.

49:37.180 --> 49:38.920
I brought you here
to ask you for money,

49:39.140 --> 49:41.597
but you're making me feel
like an asshole, so forget about it.

49:42.140 --> 49:43.846
What are you talking about?

49:44.230 --> 49:46.687
I didn't know you needed money
until literally two seconds ago.

49:46.850 --> 49:50.104
It's not just now. It's all that bullshit
about looking up to me.

49:50.730 --> 49:51.890
It's not bullshit.

49:52.820 --> 49:54.856
You put me up on a pedestal.

49:55.070 --> 49:58.153
Now that I've fallen off,
you look at me with all that goddamn pity.

49:59.910 --> 50:02.822
Ow. Stop. Stop it! Ward!

50:05.420 --> 50:06.489
Stop!

50:07.000 --> 50:10.037
I didn't ask to be the heir
to your daddy issues,

50:10.210 --> 50:13.008
so grow up, and stop begging
for my approval.

50:13.550 --> 50:16.007
It is clich.
It's pathetic!

50:25.520 --> 50:26.930
You said you had
this under control.

50:29.440 --> 50:31.260
Ithought I did. Ijust...

50:31.820 --> 50:32.809
I lost. I--

50:32.980 --> 50:38.566
Anger is a gift, Mr Rand,
if you know how to control it.

50:39.320 --> 50:41.777
It would be my
privilege to teach you.

50:43.160 --> 50:44.491
I don't wanna hurt you.

50:44.910 --> 50:47.538
I just want to know what happened
between you and my father.

50:49.460 --> 50:52.088
Is that what's driven you
into this state?

50:53.340 --> 50:55.251
He tried to shut this place down,
didn't he?

50:55.840 --> 50:57.171
So you stopped him.

50:57.430 --> 51:00.547
A shot in the dark
rarely finds its target.

51:01.260 --> 51:02.386
You deny it?

51:02.720 --> 51:04.460
Would you believe me if I did?

51:05.480 --> 51:06.845
Stay right there, boy.

51:08.060 --> 51:10.472
Submit to me
without further incident,

51:11.150 --> 51:14.222
and your friends will be granted
a merciful death.

51:15.780 --> 51:17.850
I'll die before I let you touch them.

51:18.450 --> 51:22.693
I'm afraid I can't allow you
to do that just yet, Mr Rand.

51:24.740 --> 51:25.866
Kill the women.

51:30.170 --> 51:31.876
I just want you
guys to know...

51:33.340 --> 51:35.331
I wish I'd never
come to China with you.

51:38.670 --> 51:39.830
Seems fair.

52:00.780 --> 52:02.236
They poisoned their weapons.

52:09.040 --> 52:10.826
It was her.

52:12.130 --> 52:14.166
Gao used the same
p0Ison on the pilots.

52:17.340 --> 52:19.046
That's why my plane crashed.

52:24.350 --> 52:25.840
She killed my parents.

52:31.020 --> 52:32.146
Danny...

52:57.670 --> 52:58.739
Let's go.
