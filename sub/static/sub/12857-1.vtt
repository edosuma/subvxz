00:34.984 --> 00:38.147
Hey. You need a ride?

00:39.489 --> 00:41.480
I'm Davey Diamond.

00:42.358 --> 00:44.053
You're sitting on my face.

00:45.095 --> 00:47.256
Turn around.
That's me. See?

00:47.397 --> 00:49.388
Good-looking guy, right?

00:49.566 --> 00:50.806
You need an apartment?

00:50.807 --> 00:53.400
I can help you with that.
I'll find you a gem.

00:54.304 --> 00:57.034
That's my motto:
"I'll find you a gem."

00:57.173 --> 00:59.573
You get it?
Diamond. Gem.

00:59.876 --> 01:00.759
Give me a call.

01:00.760 --> 01:03.642
You know you're gonna
need a friend in this town.

02:03.573 --> 02:06.007
Let's get a move on.

02:06.142 --> 02:08.133
I'll be in the truck.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.913
I don't know if that's what you guys
were looking for, or whatever.

03:21.050 --> 03:23.143
No, man. It was cool.
So, what's your story?

03:23.319 --> 03:25.184
I'm just looking for a band, you know.

03:25.355 --> 03:27.619
No. I mean, where you from?
Where you living?

03:27.790 --> 03:30.588
We're from everywhere, you know.
We moved around a lot.

03:30.727 --> 03:32.718
Oh, yeah.
I lived all over the Valley.

03:32.862 --> 03:35.057
I'm new in town,
so I'm still looking for a place.

03:35.198 --> 03:38.167
- Who are you staying with, man?
- I got some friends.

03:38.334 --> 03:40.529
Okay. So we gotta chat.

03:40.703 --> 03:42.796
But it was good.
We liked it.

03:43.206 --> 03:46.004
So I'll just call you guys
in a couple of days, then.

03:46.142 --> 03:48.702
Yeah, you know what?
Let me grab your cell phone.

03:49.012 --> 03:51.276
I'm still working on getting a phone...

03:51.414 --> 03:53.405
...so I'll probably have to call you.

03:53.583 --> 03:56.711
You know what?
Here. Grab our old fliers.

03:56.853 --> 03:58.844
Number. E-mail.
Call us tomorrow.

03:59.289 --> 04:01.280
All right, cool.

04:01.891 --> 04:03.984
Hey, you guys mind
if I have another slice?

04:04.360 --> 04:07.420
Take the rest, man.
Grab a beer. It's cool.

04:11.634 --> 04:13.158
Okay.

04:15.438 --> 04:17.636
I need you to make
copies of these listings,

04:17.637 --> 04:19.101
and bring them to The Standard.

04:19.242 --> 04:21.005
- Got it.
- Then...

04:22.045 --> 04:24.775
...make copies of these,
and bring them to the Simpsons.

04:24.914 --> 04:27.940
- They are so ready to buy.
- Awesome.

04:28.117 --> 04:29.584
Do that, and then call me.

04:29.752 --> 04:32.585
Is it cool if, after I do all this,
I just go home?

04:35.959 --> 04:37.950
Just call me, in case.

04:38.261 --> 04:39.728
Yeah.

04:40.797 --> 04:43.357
- You're up for this, aren't you?
- Oh, of course.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.933
So many people would love your job.
You have a free car...

04:46.069 --> 04:47.730
- I know.
...and a nice place to live.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.134
But I need you 24/7.

05:15.898 --> 05:16.887
Hey. How's it going?

05:17.367 --> 05:18.891
He's a fucking pig.

05:19.035 --> 05:21.162
Yeah, my stepdad's always trying
to do that kind of shit.

05:21.304 --> 05:25.502
- At least he didn't try to touch you.
- Yeah. That would be gross.

05:25.641 --> 05:28.194
How long you gonna
stay there, anyway?

05:28.195 --> 05:29.634
Where's your mom again?

05:30.446 --> 05:34.109
- She's in Vegas.
- She still stripping?

05:34.584 --> 05:38.543
I don't know. She says she's working
as a cocktail waitress.

05:41.924 --> 05:44.654
- Why don't you just move to Vegas?
- She won't let me.

05:44.827 --> 05:47.660
Lock your doors at night.
That's what I do.

05:47.797 --> 05:51.392
I mean, I was, like, hoping that I could
get a job and save up some money.

05:51.534 --> 05:53.263
What kind of job?

05:53.803 --> 05:56.931
I don't know.
My cousin, she lives in Silver Lake.

05:57.073 --> 05:59.974
And her roommate, or something,
is moving out in a couple weeks.

06:00.143 --> 06:01.735
And the rent's like 450 a month.

06:01.878 --> 06:06.406
I know a job where you can make a
quick 450 bucks for a couple hours' work.

06:08.351 --> 06:10.148
Nice.

06:10.286 --> 06:13.949
You need to feel like you want me.
Like you're hot for me.

06:17.026 --> 06:20.291
Nice. You want some more wine?

06:20.463 --> 06:22.454
No, I'm fine.

06:23.966 --> 06:25.957
Am I... Am I doing something wrong?

06:26.102 --> 06:27.831
You just need to relax a little bit.
Okay?

06:28.004 --> 06:29.670
You need to look at
me like you want me.

06:29.671 --> 06:30.564
Like you're hot for me.

06:30.706 --> 06:33.300
You know what it's like
to be hot for someone, right?

06:34.710 --> 06:38.578
Okay, you wanna fuck me.
And I got a big dick.

06:38.714 --> 06:39.976
Yeah.

06:40.783 --> 06:42.774
You can see that, can't you?

06:43.853 --> 06:45.251
Yeah. You know what?

06:45.252 --> 06:48.187
Talk to me a little
bit about my big dick.

06:50.259 --> 06:52.989
What do you...?
What do you want me to say?

06:55.331 --> 06:58.266
Tell me how much you wanna suck it,
how you wanna lick it.

06:58.401 --> 07:02.201
I wanna...
I wanna suck your big dick.

07:06.275 --> 07:08.266
<i>Are you watching?</i>

07:21.224 --> 07:24.216
Yeah. Hi, Anna.
Can you hold on a second?

07:30.433 --> 07:33.051
Yeah, well, I had to
run from the other side

07:33.052 --> 07:35.029
of the studio to pick the phone up.

07:37.773 --> 07:39.764
Well, I'm painting.

07:40.576 --> 07:42.567
I don't know.

07:43.446 --> 07:45.243
I don't know.

07:46.983 --> 07:49.383
A few hours, maybe.

07:49.519 --> 07:50.918
Yeah.

07:54.423 --> 07:57.119
<i>I'll just pick up some sushi</i>
<i>on the way home.</i>

08:00.196 --> 08:02.596
- Forget it.
- Thanks, Sally.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.324
Anytime.

08:13.609 --> 08:15.600
Shit.

08:20.550 --> 08:22.575
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.811
Do you know
how to get gum off a shoe?

08:24.954 --> 08:26.945
Yeah. I can do that.

08:47.210 --> 08:50.646
If you get it right away,
it usually comes right off. There we go.

08:51.380 --> 08:54.440
Just some realtor's card
I won't ever use, anyway.

08:54.850 --> 08:56.613
Buyer or seller?

08:58.321 --> 09:02.155
Me? My mother left me her house.

09:02.325 --> 09:04.054
But my girlfriend hates it.

09:04.193 --> 09:06.184
You should have me check it out.

09:06.796 --> 09:10.926
Ask anyone.
I'm the best in the neighborhood.

09:12.168 --> 09:14.159
Houses are like cars.

09:14.670 --> 09:17.605
After a while,
you wanna trade it in.

09:17.740 --> 09:20.300
I've lived in that house my whole life.

09:25.681 --> 09:28.013
Thanks for saving my shoe.

10:29.545 --> 10:31.877
<i>I went to a garden party</i>

10:33.215 --> 10:36.207
<i>To reminisce with my old friends</i>

10:37.286 --> 10:40.483
<i>A chance to share old memories</i>

10:40.623 --> 10:42.818
<i>Sing our songs again</i>

10:47.296 --> 10:50.026
Can I get a pack of rolling
papers too, please?

10:50.433 --> 10:53.425
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

10:53.569 --> 10:55.093
$7.89.

11:00.776 --> 11:04.769
You got a few bucks I could borrow?
For some food?

11:05.448 --> 11:08.281
Sorry, man.
I don't have anything.

11:09.018 --> 11:12.749
- All right.
- Hey, where you headed?

11:14.190 --> 11:18.991
I'm just, you know, hanging out.
I got some friends...

11:19.662 --> 11:23.655
- You need a ride?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

11:23.799 --> 11:25.323
All right, cool. Hop in.

12:01.570 --> 12:03.561
I like your jeans.

12:07.910 --> 12:11.107
They just... They... They're cool.

12:17.853 --> 12:20.913
- You live here?
- Well, it's my boss' place.

12:21.056 --> 12:23.786
It's kinda part of the deal.
I get to live here...

12:23.926 --> 12:28.158
...as long as I'm on call 24 hours a day,
and I watch over the plants.

12:33.102 --> 12:35.798
So do you have a girlfriend?

12:38.574 --> 12:41.873
Sorry, that's kind of
a personal question.

12:45.414 --> 12:47.541
Whoa, man, this is crazy.

12:47.683 --> 12:51.619
Yeah, and pretty elaborate.
It's all for Sally and her clients.

12:51.754 --> 12:54.621
Why do you think she's the
best realtor in the neighborhood?

12:54.757 --> 12:57.089
So okay.
You get all you want for free?

12:57.226 --> 12:59.694
Yeah. Sally warned me to be careful...

12:59.829 --> 13:01.854
...'cause the last guy that worked
for her ended up in rehab.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.499
So I try to be cool
and only smoke at night.

13:05.501 --> 13:07.765
Plus, a couple nights a week
I go to the gym.

13:08.437 --> 13:10.701
So I don't smoke on those nights.

13:12.975 --> 13:16.103
- Do you work out?
- No, man.

13:16.245 --> 13:18.577
I'm a musician.

13:18.714 --> 13:20.978
You can have some bud,
if you want any.

13:21.984 --> 13:25.112
- You serious?
- Yeah.

13:25.254 --> 13:27.245
It's pretty kind.

13:28.791 --> 13:31.055
Holy shit.

13:31.193 --> 13:33.388
You can have that.
She won't notice.

13:50.813 --> 13:53.873
Wow. You're up early.

13:54.683 --> 13:57.015
Yeah, I guess.

13:57.152 --> 14:00.349
I heard the coyotes this morning.
I couldn't go back to sleep.

14:01.357 --> 14:04.520
- These albums are amazing.
- It's just a bunch of old shit.

14:05.027 --> 14:07.461
I think they were here
when Sally bought the house.

14:09.498 --> 14:12.797
I love them, though.
I listen to them a lot.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.763
All the time.

14:15.971 --> 14:18.030
Oh, I'm making a pot of coffee.
Is that cool?

14:18.173 --> 14:20.505
Oh, yeah.
Help yourself.

14:21.644 --> 14:23.703
But I gotta get going.

14:23.846 --> 14:25.863
Sally expects me to be there early,

14:25.864 --> 14:28.340
and I have to pick up
coffee for everybody.

14:29.652 --> 14:31.779
So are you gonna stick around?

14:34.456 --> 14:36.617
I mean... See ya tonight?

14:37.192 --> 14:38.853
- Yeah, definitely.
- Okay.

14:38.994 --> 14:42.259
- All right.
- See ya.

14:44.533 --> 14:46.933
Nathan. Get in here.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.428
More packets to go out.

14:53.429 --> 14:56.339
And make sure you put
samples in everybody's packet.

14:56.512 --> 14:58.503
I thought I put them in every packet.

14:58.647 --> 15:00.274
- Okay, okay. Shut up.
- Sorry.

15:00.416 --> 15:03.010
By the way,
how are my samples doing?

15:05.220 --> 15:07.211
I haven't been in there in a couple days.

15:07.756 --> 15:10.554
That is not our agreement.
You go in there tonight...

15:10.726 --> 15:12.717
...and make sure
my babies are doing okay.

15:12.895 --> 15:16.831
- Are you stoned?
- No. Why would I...? Why would I be...?

15:16.966 --> 15:19.730
- I don't want you being stoned at work.
- I'm not stoned.

15:19.902 --> 15:24.168
All right, bye. Hurry up.
The phone is ringing.

15:25.708 --> 15:28.040
Sally St. Clair's office.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.510
- How you doing?
- Real good.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.918
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

15:43.892 --> 15:45.883
She's...

15:47.396 --> 15:49.227
...kinda young.

15:49.398 --> 15:51.389
I thought that's how you liked them.

15:51.533 --> 15:54.696
Look, just take care of her,
and we'll take care of you.

15:55.137 --> 15:58.265
- Both of you?
- You know it.

16:33.575 --> 16:35.176
This is so frickin' sweet.
I'm diggin' it.

16:35.177 --> 16:36.703
Yeah, it's tight.
I've got some ideas.

16:36.845 --> 16:41.339
- We should blow the fuck up, fool!
- For sure.

17:04.073 --> 17:06.050
Hold up, hold up.
Dude, that was awesome.

17:06.050 --> 17:07.133
When did you write that?

17:08.277 --> 17:11.734
This morning. I was thinking about
what you guys played yesterday.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.594
I put on a pot of coffee,
and went at it.

17:13.595 --> 17:15.145
You wanna play a
show Friday night?

17:15.284 --> 17:17.045
We're supposed to play this party.

17:17.046 --> 17:19.220
John was gonna sing,
but he fuckin' sucks.

17:19.354 --> 17:22.289
You're, like, killer.
Let's just have him sing, man.

17:22.424 --> 17:24.415
The parents are out of town.

17:24.560 --> 17:27.688
It's gonna be a sweet party,
up in the hills. You should come.

17:27.863 --> 17:30.058
Yeah. Sounds good.

17:30.232 --> 17:32.223
Dirk, give him the address.

17:32.835 --> 17:34.826
Here. Take a flier.

17:36.171 --> 17:38.639
I'm gonna have to bum a ride.
Is it cool if I bring somebody?

17:38.774 --> 17:42.369
It's like 10 bucks for beer, but I'm sure
we can get your buddy in. Right?

17:42.544 --> 17:44.202
For sure. Get there around 5.

17:44.203 --> 17:46.776
We can set up, play.
We might play Hollywood.

17:46.915 --> 17:49.907
- You wanna do this again?
- Yeah, count it off.

18:02.564 --> 18:04.930
- <i>Studio.</i>
- Hello.

18:05.067 --> 18:07.058
- <i>Can I help you?</i>
- Yeah. Hi.

18:07.202 --> 18:09.329
I was wondering
if I could get my photo taken.

18:09.471 --> 18:11.268
<i>Did you see my site?</i>

18:11.406 --> 18:13.874
- No, a friend.
- <i>A friend?</i>

18:14.009 --> 18:17.069
Yeah, she told me that a friend
of hers got her photo taken.

18:17.212 --> 18:19.419
<i>You know the kind
of pictures I take?</i>

18:19.420 --> 18:20.204
Yeah, I know.

18:21.283 --> 18:25.344
<i>- Okay. And it's 450, right?</i>
<i>- It's 450 if you're good.</i>

18:25.487 --> 18:27.955
<i>Okay. So, what do I have to do?</i>

18:28.090 --> 18:32.550
- <i>Studio.</i>
- Hi. I'm here to get my picture taken.

18:45.741 --> 18:48.232
- You're early.
- I took Metro.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.709
Really? How was that?
I've never been on it.

18:50.846 --> 18:52.404
It's easy.

18:53.649 --> 18:56.641
Come in.
So your friends told you about us.

18:56.785 --> 18:59.583
What did they say?
Good things, I hope.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.188
Stop.

19:03.792 --> 19:07.660
I wanna see you in that light.
Beautiful.

19:07.830 --> 19:11.266
God, I can't wait to take
your picture. You're beautiful.

19:11.433 --> 19:14.425
People tell you you're beautiful
all the time, don't they?

19:15.771 --> 19:18.934
Okay. You know what?
Let's make this easy, all right?

19:19.608 --> 19:20.851
There's a robe in there.

19:20.852 --> 19:23.544
Take off your clothes,
put on the robe, come on out.

19:23.679 --> 19:27.274
We'll just start
with some simple headshots, okay?

19:27.416 --> 19:29.816
Come on, let me hear you say "okay".

19:30.752 --> 19:32.242
Okay.

19:59.381 --> 20:02.043
- Sally St. Clair's office.
- Yeah, hi. Is Sally in?

20:02.217 --> 20:05.118
- Yeah, may I ask who's calling?
- This is Todd Winger.

20:05.287 --> 20:08.188
- I'm sorry, one more time?
- Todd Winger.

20:08.357 --> 20:10.655
Todd Winger.
Okay, can you hold please? Thank you.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.657
We got a live one.

20:14.696 --> 20:16.823
Name, please? Hello?

20:18.934 --> 20:21.198
Todd Wang...? Wanger?

20:21.370 --> 20:23.361
Todd Winger.

20:25.874 --> 20:28.468
Hello, Todd.
So are you ready?

20:28.944 --> 20:32.903
Yeah. I'm the guy
who took the gum off your shoe.

20:33.348 --> 20:36.476
And you did a damn fine job of it.

20:37.152 --> 20:41.088
<i>Mother left you a house.</i>
<i>When can I see it?</i>

20:43.892 --> 20:46.827
Tomorrow afternoon?
How would that work?

20:46.962 --> 20:49.396
How about 3:00?

20:49.965 --> 20:51.523
Yeah, that sounds good.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.431
<i>You know I'm not really sure</i>
<i>that I wanna sell.</i>

20:54.569 --> 20:58.096
Yes, of course.
This is just an exploratory meeting.

21:00.175 --> 21:04.236
Your girlfriend doesn't like
this place because...?

21:04.379 --> 21:06.108
She says it's too big.

21:07.449 --> 21:10.976
You could pretty much move anywhere
you want if you sold this house.

21:11.653 --> 21:16.181
- What did your mother do?
- Nothing. She married well.

21:16.925 --> 21:19.223
My dad was a lot older.

21:19.394 --> 21:21.472
He developed a lot of
property out in the Valley.

21:21.473 --> 21:22.386
He was pretty well off.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.591
So I take it you don't need the money.

21:26.134 --> 21:28.034
No, not really.

21:28.804 --> 21:30.795
Well, you could always rent it out.

21:30.939 --> 21:33.134
Yeah, I just don't know
if I'm ready to move.

21:33.275 --> 21:36.108
I grew up in this house.

21:37.145 --> 21:39.739
So how did you get into real estate?

21:43.285 --> 21:44.877
I was...

21:45.387 --> 21:48.254
...desperate for a job where
I didn't have to take my clothes off.

21:49.224 --> 21:54.025
Some guy walked into the club where
I was working and offered me a job.

21:54.730 --> 21:57.494
He figured I'd be an easy lay.

21:58.266 --> 22:00.257
So...

22:01.269 --> 22:04.705
...I stole all of his clients,
and here we are.

22:08.510 --> 22:10.808
I've seen your picture before
on the Internet.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.071
You were much younger.

22:16.018 --> 22:18.009
What pictures?

22:20.589 --> 22:22.284
Show me.

22:37.672 --> 22:39.765
How did you find these photos?

22:39.941 --> 22:42.341
They've been on there forever.

22:43.311 --> 22:45.108
Is it your head
on someone else's body?

22:46.448 --> 22:48.040
Nope.

22:49.885 --> 22:51.876
It's me.

22:52.888 --> 22:55.982
A few years ago, but it's still me.

22:56.124 --> 22:57.955
You look good.

22:58.293 --> 23:00.284
I still do.

23:02.364 --> 23:04.628
So who owns the pictures?

23:07.302 --> 23:09.293
A real low-life.

23:11.373 --> 23:14.137
I guess you could call him
my first boyfriend.

23:14.309 --> 23:16.815
I sold 15 million dollars
worth of real estate

23:16.816 --> 23:18.575
for that son-of-a
bitch last year.

23:18.713 --> 23:21.307
He is not gonna cut
my commission now.

23:21.450 --> 23:24.715
No. No. I want my full commission.
I don't give a shit.

23:24.853 --> 23:27.481
I do not give one shit.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.647
- David?
- He doesn't have the money? Fuck him.

23:29.791 --> 23:32.157
I'll fight him
all the way to the courthouse.

23:32.594 --> 23:34.585
I gotta go. I gotta go.

23:34.796 --> 23:38.197
- Hi, I'm Leni.
- Leni, I'm David.

23:39.734 --> 23:41.463
Come here.

23:42.804 --> 23:46.467
Wow. Wow, you're a knockout.

23:46.608 --> 23:50.135
- Your picture doesn't do you justice.
- Thank you.

23:50.278 --> 23:52.269
So you hungry?

23:52.414 --> 23:54.405
- Sure.
- Come on.

24:05.193 --> 24:06.751
Excellent.

24:11.566 --> 24:14.433
- I hope you like Indian food.
- I do.

24:14.569 --> 24:16.833
I like spicy food.

24:22.444 --> 24:23.968
Thank you.

24:25.046 --> 24:29.380
So here's to new
and exciting opportunities.

24:40.929 --> 24:43.921
You looked a lot
different in your picture.

24:45.667 --> 24:47.965
That picture was taken a year ago.

24:50.739 --> 24:54.300
And you're 40?

24:55.110 --> 24:57.101
You're starting to insult me now, Leni.

24:57.279 --> 25:00.737
No, no, no. It's just that I'm still new
to the online dating...

25:00.882 --> 25:02.975
...and I get confused.

25:03.151 --> 25:06.746
Then let me tell you something:
There's nothing to be confused about.

25:06.888 --> 25:10.949
Hey, you're a beautiful woman.
I'm a very successful guy.

25:11.359 --> 25:12.136
And afterwards,

25:12.137 --> 25:15.090
I'll take you back to my estate
and I'll show you around.

25:18.033 --> 25:20.024
You confused still?

25:23.772 --> 25:25.763
Have a drink.

25:26.274 --> 25:29.175
- Come on.
- No, no. I wait for my car.

25:29.311 --> 25:32.906
No, no. We'll come back for your car.
It'll be better that way.

25:33.048 --> 25:34.709
- I wait for my car!
- Come on!

25:34.849 --> 25:36.840
I wait for my car.

25:36.985 --> 25:39.112
Oh, yeah? Okay, I get it.

25:39.254 --> 25:42.781
I mean, you let a guy take you out
for an expensive meal, right?

25:42.924 --> 25:45.154
And that's it?
I hope you enjoyed it.

25:45.327 --> 25:47.522
Here. Come on.
Go get her car.

25:47.662 --> 25:50.790
Piece of shit.
What is it? A fuckin' Yugo?

25:53.068 --> 25:55.059
So I'm not good enough for you?
Is that it?

25:55.203 --> 25:57.467
You want somebody younger?

25:57.606 --> 25:59.904
You want somebody better-looking?

26:00.075 --> 26:01.633
Yes.

26:01.810 --> 26:02.793
What are you looking at?

26:02.794 --> 26:04.677
You know how much money
I spend in this place?

26:04.813 --> 26:07.873
- Yeah. Not enough, though.
- Leni, huh?

26:07.983 --> 26:11.009
Leni. I bet that's
not even your real name.

26:11.152 --> 26:13.313
Go on back to the strip club, Leni!

26:34.843 --> 26:36.276
Hello?

26:56.131 --> 26:58.258
It's nice, huh?

26:58.400 --> 26:59.867
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:00.001 --> 27:03.869
You know, my mom always promised
she was gonna put in a pool.

27:04.005 --> 27:06.064
And then she never did it.

27:06.207 --> 27:08.330
Come on. Playtime's over.
Let's get out. 

27:08.331 --> 27:08.937
All right.

27:09.077 --> 27:11.068
I'll show you the house.

27:15.216 --> 27:18.413
- Wow, pretty swank.
- Yeah.

27:18.553 --> 27:20.817
The guy's dad is, like, a software dude.

27:20.955 --> 27:23.219
Makes a lot of cash, I guess.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.885
No, I'm cool.

27:28.630 --> 27:31.565
You wanna call me?
I mean, I'll pick you up.

27:32.300 --> 27:35.292
Don't worry about it.
I'll find a ride home.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.840
- Hey, Sammy.
- Yeah?

27:42.644 --> 27:44.134
Nothing.

27:44.312 --> 27:46.303
They're all out here.

27:49.584 --> 27:51.575
It's a cool house, huh?

27:53.455 --> 27:55.446
There's the band.

28:03.398 --> 28:06.663
Sammy, you made it.
Very cool.

28:06.801 --> 28:10.328
- What's up, man? You want a beer?
- No, not right now.

28:10.739 --> 28:12.730
I see you met Becky.

28:13.875 --> 28:16.901
- These are the rest of our groupies.
- Shut up, Wayne.

28:17.045 --> 28:19.036
All right, man.
You wanna go set up, or what?

28:23.218 --> 28:25.209
Five-letter word for "enlightenment"?

28:25.353 --> 28:27.617
You're asking the wrong guy, pal.

28:29.023 --> 28:31.617
Not tonight, please.

28:31.760 --> 28:34.228
I'll do it first thing in the morning.
I promise, yeah.

28:34.362 --> 28:36.455
Oh, right now?

28:36.831 --> 28:40.631
Yeah, I'm out pulling the signs
out of the yards of your competitors.

28:41.369 --> 28:44.634
Yeah, okay. 8 a.m.
Absolutely. Bye.

28:46.975 --> 28:49.967
Hey, I'll have a beer.
You know, whatever's cheapest.

28:56.518 --> 28:58.349
Your phone is ringing.

28:59.921 --> 29:01.320
Thanks.

29:06.928 --> 29:08.828
Five-letter word for "enlightenment"?

29:09.464 --> 29:12.262
I never was any good at that stuff.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.597
"African nut-bearing tree"?
Four letters.

29:15.737 --> 29:19.537
- Life is my fucking puzzle.
- Okay. What do you do for fun?

29:22.877 --> 29:27.007
Honestly? Nothing.
Yeah, my life is a joyless existence.

29:27.148 --> 29:30.345
I work, I sleep, I do a bit of pot,
and I drink. That's it.

29:30.485 --> 29:32.919
I'm basically totally alone,
and lonely all the time.

29:32.920 --> 29:34.046
Aren't you glad you asked?

29:34.222 --> 29:36.690
Yeah. I am.

29:39.494 --> 29:43.225
- What do you do for a living?
- I work for a real estate agent.

29:43.364 --> 29:45.355
How's that going?

29:46.100 --> 29:48.364
Does "joyless existence" ring a bell?

29:49.437 --> 29:51.769
Hey, let me buy you a shot.

29:51.906 --> 29:54.739
And let's get you a real beer.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.527
April.

30:14.529 --> 30:16.861
Hey. How are you?

30:16.998 --> 30:19.057
I'm okay.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.998
What...? What kind of bar is this?

30:23.805 --> 30:27.502
It's... It's a lesbian bar.

30:28.943 --> 30:30.934
So I got my money.

30:32.013 --> 30:35.210
- What money?
- The money for my month's rent.

30:35.817 --> 30:37.512
What rent?

30:39.020 --> 30:41.420
Rent for your apartment...

30:41.556 --> 30:44.684
...'cause you said
that your roommate was moving out.

30:44.826 --> 30:46.817
I am her roommate.

30:48.096 --> 30:50.860
Your cousin can be a
little bitch sometimes.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.092
Listen, I can't go back home.

30:55.570 --> 30:56.832
Why?

30:58.506 --> 31:00.235
Long story, but...

31:00.375 --> 31:03.833
...can I just stay with you guys
for a couple nights, or something?

31:03.978 --> 31:07.436
Yeah, sweetie.
Take a walk on the wild side.

31:08.516 --> 31:11.041
<i>I went to a garden party</i>

31:11.185 --> 31:14.450
<i>To reminisce with my old friends</i>

31:15.056 --> 31:18.514
<i>A chance to share old memories</i>

31:18.660 --> 31:20.855
<i>And play our songs again</i>

31:21.396 --> 31:25.059
<i>When I got to the garden party</i>

31:25.233 --> 31:28.134
<i>They all knew my name</i>

31:28.303 --> 31:31.864
<i>But no one recognized me</i>

31:32.006 --> 31:34.236
<i>I didn't look the same</i>

31:34.342 --> 31:39.541
<i>But it's all right now</i>
<i>I learned my lesson well</i>

31:39.647 --> 31:41.672
Hey...

31:41.849 --> 31:44.545
<i>You see, you can't please everyone</i>

31:44.686 --> 31:47.917
<i>So you gotta please yourself</i>

31:48.489 --> 31:51.686
<i>People came from miles around</i>

31:51.826 --> 31:54.727
<i>Everyone was there</i>

31:54.862 --> 31:59.060
<i>Well, he was playing guitar</i>
<i>Just like ringing a bell</i>

31:59.233 --> 32:00.996
<i>And lookin' like he should</i>

32:01.169 --> 32:05.162
<i>Well, if you gotta
play garden parties</i>

32:05.340 --> 32:07.467
<i>I wish you a lot of luck</i>

32:08.109 --> 32:11.977
<i>But if memories were all I sang</i>

32:12.113 --> 32:14.274
<i>I'd rather drive a truck</i>

32:14.382 --> 32:16.612
<i>But it's all right now...</i>

32:16.784 --> 32:18.843
One: I'm not afraid to love.

32:18.987 --> 32:22.855
Two: I'm not afraid to be loved.
I know that sounds weird...

32:22.991 --> 32:26.188
...but I'm ready to make something
happen with the three of us together.

32:28.029 --> 32:29.656
Do you hear that?

32:48.549 --> 32:50.039
Hey.

32:51.953 --> 32:53.284
Hey.

32:54.622 --> 32:56.886
I really liked your songs.
They were amazing.

32:57.291 --> 32:59.555
That's cool. Thanks.

32:59.727 --> 33:01.718
No, I mean it.

33:02.363 --> 33:05.764
So do you go to school
with Wayne and the guys?

33:05.900 --> 33:08.562
I don't really go to school.

33:09.837 --> 33:13.568
- You live around here?
- I'm staying with a friend.

33:13.975 --> 33:16.284
I didn't go to the Tony Awards
with Lance Bass.

33:16.285 --> 33:17.968
I don't bat left-handed.
I gotta go.

33:18.112 --> 33:20.239
How are you? I'm Joey Zane.
Nice to meet you.

33:20.715 --> 33:23.342
Put 'er there, big guy.
That's an Army handshake.

33:23.343 --> 33:24.708
That's a lot of confidence.

33:24.852 --> 33:27.412
I gotta tell you: I love you, kid.
I think you're very talented.

33:27.588 --> 33:29.920
You're one of the best.
You can go straight to the top.

33:30.058 --> 33:32.482
I'm managing a band.
We're looking for a lead singer.

33:32.483 --> 33:33.425
We got great material.

33:33.594 --> 33:36.188
I think you should come on down
and meet some of the guys.

33:36.330 --> 33:39.925
What's this? Uh-oh. Shabba!
Yeah. It's my business card.

33:40.068 --> 33:41.831
With you on board,
this could be huge.

33:42.003 --> 33:44.597
I know this because of my dad,
Chucky Lane.

33:44.772 --> 33:47.434
The Chucky Lane.
Come on, guy.

33:47.809 --> 33:50.539
He found Kurt Cobain working
at a fucking Abercrombie and Fitch.

33:50.678 --> 33:52.669
Where do you think
The Finals came from?

33:52.814 --> 33:55.078
He found the Ohio Players in Michigan.

33:55.216 --> 33:57.844
Look, I've been doing this
since I was in 8th grade.

33:58.019 --> 34:00.852
I've already signed a dozen bands
to major labels. You could be next.

34:01.022 --> 34:03.490
I just said that out loud.
Sounds good. Got a nice ring to it.

34:03.825 --> 34:06.350
Okay, you promise
you're gonna call me, daddy?

34:06.494 --> 34:09.360
- Yeah. I promise.
- You got a boyish grin.

34:09.496 --> 34:11.580
You're slick as a wolf.
I don't trust you.

34:11.581 --> 34:12.694
Hit me with your number.

34:12.867 --> 34:16.803
- I don't really have a number.
- What are you, fuckin' Amish?

34:16.971 --> 34:18.962
No, I just got into town.

34:19.107 --> 34:19.900
I fuckin' love it.

34:19.900 --> 34:22.235
He's like a Poison video
waiting to happen, this guy.

34:22.376 --> 34:25.504
I tell you what: I'm gonna give you
my backup phone, okay?

34:25.646 --> 34:27.311
I'm gonna call you on this.

34:27.312 --> 34:30.208
When I call you,
I want you to answer. Take it.

34:30.918 --> 34:32.579
Free minutes on the weekend, okay?

34:33.121 --> 34:35.315
Don't worry.
I only use it when I can't get a signal.

34:35.489 --> 34:37.650
I'm outta here.
You look beautiful.

34:47.168 --> 34:50.069
- Hello.
- Yes, daddy! You're on the team.

34:50.204 --> 34:53.002
That was a fuckin' test, and guess
who just passed. You did, my man.

34:53.141 --> 34:54.867
Does that girl play tambourine?

34:54.868 --> 34:57.373
I got another business
card for you, sweetie.

35:08.289 --> 35:11.281
No, no, leave those. We're counting.
He's gotta drive home to Orange County.

35:11.425 --> 35:13.416
Bullshit. Take 'em away.
I wanna lose count.

35:13.561 --> 35:15.620
Leave these.
I like these ones.

35:15.763 --> 35:18.163
- Put some more in that one.
- Fill me up. Thank you very much.

35:18.299 --> 35:19.823
Two of those.

35:22.170 --> 35:24.314
Listen, I hate to do
it to you, sweetheart,

35:24.315 --> 35:25.435
but I gotta see some ID.

35:25.573 --> 35:27.404
That's fine.
I just want something to eat.

35:27.575 --> 35:28.240
Excuse me.

35:28.241 --> 35:31.102
I'll pay for whatever
it is that she wants.

35:31.979 --> 35:35.312
How's it going, huh? How are you?
You remember me.

35:35.449 --> 35:39.977
Come down here, just for a second.
Come down here for one second.

35:40.121 --> 35:42.248
I want you to meet
a good friend of mine. This is Nathan.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.518
- How's it going?
- Just come down for one second.

35:46.327 --> 35:48.591
There we go.
That's my girl.

35:54.435 --> 35:57.131
- Do you get high?
- Not in years.

35:57.471 --> 35:59.564
Mind if I fire up?

36:00.541 --> 36:04.443
- It won't affect your driving?
- No, not really.

36:05.813 --> 36:07.974
I probably drive better stoned.

36:11.419 --> 36:13.751
I'll take that as a yes.

36:24.298 --> 36:28.291
- How'd you find that picture of me?
- Ever since I saw that picture...

36:28.436 --> 36:32.304
...I've been obsessed with you.
I always look at it.

36:34.108 --> 36:36.303
I guess you're my dream girl.

36:38.713 --> 36:40.977
That picture was 10 years ago.

36:48.589 --> 36:50.887
I'm a working stiff.

36:51.058 --> 36:53.458
But I'm flattered.

36:54.195 --> 36:56.254
Do you have a boyfriend?

36:57.031 --> 36:58.828
Nope.

37:00.134 --> 37:02.125
I live alone.

37:06.073 --> 37:08.303
Are you okay?

37:09.677 --> 37:11.736
Wow, that was quick.

37:12.280 --> 37:13.747
Yeah.

37:13.948 --> 37:17.281
You know,
my girlfriend would love this place.

37:17.418 --> 37:19.409
How long you been here?

37:20.354 --> 37:22.345
Two years.

37:22.623 --> 37:26.150
But I'm just renting.
I already own a couple houses.

37:26.294 --> 37:29.286
I don't want all my money
in L.A. Real Estate.

37:31.365 --> 37:33.356
Smart.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.840
Is this your fantasy?

37:44.979 --> 37:47.379
Something like that, yeah.

37:48.783 --> 37:53.379
If I acted out your fantasy,
would you do something for me?

37:53.654 --> 37:57.055
Maybe. I guess.

37:57.658 --> 37:59.649
Well, which is it?

38:00.528 --> 38:02.519
What do you want me to do?

38:05.599 --> 38:09.660
It depends.
What do you want me to do?

38:30.224 --> 38:32.215
I'm sorry.

38:41.302 --> 38:43.293
No, no, no. Come here.

38:43.471 --> 38:45.962
Nathan, get a little closer to her.
She's not gonna bite.

38:46.107 --> 38:48.735
There you go. That's good.

38:49.510 --> 38:54.345
Wow. God, you two look great together.
You should let me take your picture.

38:54.515 --> 38:57.507
- You just did.
- That's not what he means.

38:57.651 --> 39:01.018
- Well, what do you mean?
- Sexy pictures.

39:01.722 --> 39:05.658
You mean...? Well, how much?
I mean, like, how sexy?

39:05.793 --> 39:07.784
You know, that depends.

39:09.463 --> 39:11.097
Oh, man. You're packing.

39:11.098 --> 39:14.093
That could be a pretty
good chunk of change.

39:15.403 --> 39:18.804
- You're kidding, right?
- No, he's not.

39:19.407 --> 39:22.035
I don't want my picture
all over the Internet.

39:22.176 --> 39:23.752
Sweetheart already sat for me.

39:23.753 --> 39:26.010
I don't even want your
head in my pictures.

39:26.147 --> 39:28.672
In fact, my clients prefer it
if they don't even see your face.

39:28.816 --> 39:30.807
It makes them
a little bit uncomfortable...

39:30.951 --> 39:33.715
...to see another man's face
while they're... you know...

39:34.822 --> 39:36.483
...enjoying my pictures.

39:36.624 --> 39:39.058
- I don't know.
- Come on. Listen, sweetheart.

39:39.226 --> 39:43.424
Another 2000, for an hour's work. 2000.

39:43.564 --> 39:46.897
Nathan. 2000, man.

39:47.435 --> 39:51.531
Come on. Look at her, dude.
She's asking you with her eyes, man.

39:52.306 --> 39:54.501
Let's party.
Let's do this.

39:54.909 --> 39:57.309
- Okay, but I need another shot.
- Another shot for all of us.

39:57.445 --> 39:59.811
Come on, come on.
Hey, Huey.

40:00.648 --> 40:05.381
Sammy. It's a really cool name.
It's, like, totally biblical, right?

40:05.519 --> 40:06.982
I really think your
music's amazing.

40:06.983 --> 40:08.682
I can totally hear you
on the radio already.

40:12.059 --> 40:15.790
All right, you have to be quiet.
My aunt's sleeping. Okay?

40:30.344 --> 40:32.505
I wanna take your picture.

40:35.082 --> 40:36.481
Okay.

40:39.019 --> 40:41.010
Take off your shirt.

41:03.878 --> 41:05.869
Now your pants.

41:21.395 --> 41:23.795
What's wrong with you?
Come on, look at her.

41:23.931 --> 41:26.331
What?
She doesn't do it for you?

41:26.467 --> 41:28.594
I'm sorry.

41:29.270 --> 41:31.568
Okay. I still get paid, no matter what.

41:33.541 --> 41:35.008
All right.

41:36.744 --> 41:39.076
Already a seasoned professional.

41:39.480 --> 41:41.880
All right, look.
What's going on?

41:42.016 --> 41:44.484
Okay. Look, man,
I really don't think this is a good idea.

41:44.618 --> 41:46.415
Why? Come on, it'll be fun.

41:46.554 --> 41:50.012
I'm just not into her.
You know what I mean?

41:53.561 --> 41:56.621
Oh, right. Okay.
I understand. Hold on.

41:59.166 --> 42:01.691
I think this is more your style, huh?

42:03.304 --> 42:05.772
It figures, with a
schlong like yours, huh?

42:10.911 --> 42:12.902
All right, come on over here.

42:15.916 --> 42:17.907
Take your coat off.

42:32.466 --> 42:34.457
All right, now turn around.

42:36.003 --> 42:38.631
Didn't you check it out before?

42:38.806 --> 42:41.138
Yeah, I did.
I wanna see it again.

42:55.022 --> 42:57.252
- Everything in its place?
- Very nice.

43:07.735 --> 43:09.225
Very good.

43:13.407 --> 43:15.898
I don't want you talking anymore.

43:16.043 --> 43:18.204
The only thing
I want you to say is, "Yes, sir."

43:19.113 --> 43:20.774
Yes, sir.

43:20.948 --> 43:23.246
Now go look at yourself in the mirror.
Fix it.

43:23.384 --> 43:25.249
Yes, sir.

43:29.923 --> 43:32.790
Okay. Interesting.

43:49.043 --> 43:52.979
All right, that's good.
Now come over here.

44:05.392 --> 44:09.021
All right, hold it.
That's nice.

44:09.563 --> 44:13.226
Let me just look at that.

44:14.768 --> 44:17.293
Okay, now go lay down on the couch.

44:19.106 --> 44:21.097
Yes, sir.

44:30.117 --> 44:31.584
Whoa.

44:33.253 --> 44:35.244
Let's get some breakfast.

44:37.191 --> 44:39.785
I gotta feed my dog,
and get to the office.

44:42.129 --> 44:43.596
Well...

44:44.331 --> 44:47.926
...then I'll just wait
for you to call me.

44:50.804 --> 44:53.602
I'd never done anything like that before.

45:05.753 --> 45:08.620
Hey. Where did you go?
I was worried.

45:08.756 --> 45:11.088
I just went out with some friends.

45:11.225 --> 45:15.093
- You stayed up all night.
- Yeah.

45:15.229 --> 45:17.220
You should be more careful.

45:21.168 --> 45:23.500
Go get some sleep in my bed.

46:10.150 --> 46:12.141
What are you doing here?

46:15.756 --> 46:17.223
Hey.

46:18.125 --> 46:21.617
Hey. What are you doing here?

46:21.795 --> 46:23.956
I'm a friend of Nathan's.

46:25.566 --> 46:27.557
Are you two lovers?

46:29.436 --> 46:32.496
No. Nothing like that.

46:34.775 --> 46:38.040
Well, don't let me disturb you.

46:59.600 --> 47:02.865
- What can I get for you?
- Actually, I saw your sign outside.

47:03.003 --> 47:04.994
I was wondering
if you guys are still hiring.

47:05.138 --> 47:07.606
Yeah, we're hiring. But we may
have already found someone.

47:08.742 --> 47:12.940
Well, could I at least write down
my name or something, just in case...

47:13.580 --> 47:17.676
- You looking for a job?
- Kind of. I mean, yeah.

47:21.688 --> 47:23.087
Call me.

47:24.625 --> 47:27.617
- What do you want? It's on me.
- Really?

47:27.761 --> 47:31.094
- Yeah. What do you want?
- Okay. Can I get a hot chocolate?

47:31.265 --> 47:33.756
Hot chocolate.
Good, very good. Very sweet.

47:33.901 --> 47:37.769
So I'll have a latte,
extra hot, non-fat.

47:41.608 --> 47:44.907
Hello? Anna?

47:54.788 --> 47:56.380
Anna?

47:59.526 --> 48:01.517
Anna, hey.
What's going on?

48:01.662 --> 48:05.223
I'm leaving.
I can't take another day of this.

48:05.732 --> 48:07.324
Of what?

48:09.136 --> 48:11.127
I don't know, Todd.

48:11.271 --> 48:15.799
Everything around here is so dark,
and I'm just looking for some light.

48:18.011 --> 48:20.241
Can you close that?

48:21.148 --> 48:22.615
Yeah.

48:25.152 --> 48:28.485
- It's broken.
- All right.

48:28.622 --> 48:30.487
Where you gonna go?

48:30.624 --> 48:32.819
I'm gonna go stay at Donna's.

48:32.960 --> 48:35.861
I'll come back for my stuff
in a couple of days.

48:36.763 --> 48:39.357
- We broke up.
- Why?

48:39.499 --> 48:40.966
I don't know.

48:44.638 --> 48:47.630
We hardly ever
saw each other anymore.

48:48.575 --> 48:51.703
- I don't think she thought I loved her.
- Did you?

48:51.845 --> 48:56.043
I don't know.
Can we not get into this today?

48:56.183 --> 48:58.515
What does love mean to you?

49:00.988 --> 49:04.185
Love. Love is something I can't have.

49:06.360 --> 49:09.989
I don't believe love exists for me.

49:10.530 --> 49:12.521
Did you love Anna?

49:14.001 --> 49:17.596
I wanna talk about something else.
I don't wanna talk about this.

49:17.738 --> 49:20.468
It's your session.
What do you want to talk about?

49:21.274 --> 49:23.936
Well, I don't know.

49:24.111 --> 49:28.275
It was good. All right, here he comes.
I'll call you later.

49:31.218 --> 49:33.686
That's your phone.
Maybe it's Joey.

49:33.820 --> 49:37.381
- Yeah, or somebody for Joey.
- Oh, just answer it.

49:43.030 --> 49:45.089
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, kid. How's it going?</i>

49:45.232 --> 49:47.894
- <i>You get some last night?</i>
- Get some what?

49:48.035 --> 49:49.233
<i>Hey, that's your business.</i>

49:49.234 --> 49:50.902
<i>My business is music,
daddy, all right?</i>

49:51.038 --> 49:53.621
<i>I want you to come by the
studio and meet some people.</i>

49:53.622 --> 49:54.496
<i>You have a pen?</i>

49:54.641 --> 49:56.370
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah.

49:56.510 --> 49:57.948
<i>You're playing coy.
I like that.</i>

49:57.949 --> 50:00.105
<i>I saw that sexy little devil
you were with last night.</i>

50:00.247 --> 50:01.852
<i>It's on Rowena
and Silver Lake.</i>

50:01.853 --> 50:03.580
<i>I want you to get
there around 4:00.</i>

50:03.717 --> 50:05.346
<i>You're gonna see
me waiting outside.</i>

50:05.347 --> 50:07.050
<i>I'm gonna walk you up,
so don't be late.</i>

50:07.187 --> 50:09.781
Yeah, okay. All right.

50:13.393 --> 50:14.860
That is so cool!

50:15.028 --> 50:16.080
Is this "Making the Band"?

50:16.081 --> 50:17.861
I'm not holding auditions.
Yeah, I gotta go.

50:17.998 --> 50:19.989
Let's go.
Time is money, time is money.

50:20.133 --> 50:22.727
I'm sweating like Patrick Ewing
in the 4th quarter of game seven.

50:22.869 --> 50:25.599
- Jesus, kid. Where you sleeping?
- At a friend's house.

50:25.739 --> 50:29.004
Yeah? Who's your friend, baby Jesus?
Look like you been sleeping in a manger.

50:29.142 --> 50:31.372
Let's go.
Whatever, it's a look.

50:32.079 --> 50:33.323
Hey. What's crackin', guys?

50:33.324 --> 50:35.810
Dude, this is the fucking
kid I was telling you about.

50:35.949 --> 50:37.940
This is Sammy.
The kid's a fucking genius.

50:38.085 --> 50:39.142
Sammy, this is Everbright.

50:39.143 --> 50:41.418
That's Harry, that's Kevin,
and that's Neil right there.

50:41.555 --> 50:43.113
How's it going, Sam?

50:43.290 --> 50:45.417
- So you ready to sing something?
- Yeah, whatever.

50:45.559 --> 50:48.392
I love it. The kid's always on the go.
Kev, give me the lyric sheet.

50:50.797 --> 50:52.788
- Dude, how was that weed I gave you?
- So good.

50:52.933 --> 50:55.231
Dude, it melted your face off, didn't it?

50:55.368 --> 50:58.633
- Can I hear the track?
- Roll that shit, roll that shit.

51:02.576 --> 51:05.773
It's like listening to the Beatles'
White Album for the first time.

51:11.585 --> 51:14.053
Pop off this shit, pop off it.

51:17.190 --> 51:20.921
This is cool. I like it. It's poppy.

51:21.094 --> 51:23.324
You should give me a minute
to work on the lyrics, or whatever.

51:23.463 --> 51:26.193
He's gonna feel it out
like Ray Charles looking for a cricket.

51:26.333 --> 51:29.325
I'll be his silent mom in the corner.
I'm not gonna say a goddamn thing.

51:29.469 --> 51:31.869
How 'bout you, sweetie?
You party on a school night?

51:32.005 --> 51:33.905
Oh, my gosh.

51:38.145 --> 51:40.909
Fifty bucks.
PayPal it to me.

51:41.081 --> 51:43.072
Yeah, okay, hold on.

51:50.557 --> 51:52.957
- <i>You should have it.</i>
- The URL is registered...

51:53.093 --> 51:58.690
...to 5045 Prospect, box #409.
It's a mailbox shop.

51:59.032 --> 52:01.500
- <i>The name on the account is fake.</i>
- How do you know?

52:01.635 --> 52:04.536
<i>"IB Horny".</i>
<i>Sound real to you?</i>

52:23.256 --> 52:27.249
God bless, brother. God bless.

52:48.748 --> 52:52.514
Thanks... Mr. Horny.

52:55.288 --> 52:56.880
Check.

52:58.825 --> 53:02.158
<i>Yeah, I could come up a bit.
It's cool.</i>

53:02.562 --> 53:04.553
Check. Yeah, it's good.

53:25.719 --> 53:27.710
He changed the lyrics.

53:27.854 --> 53:29.981
Just listen to it for a second.

53:40.066 --> 53:43.524
What did I tell you? The kid's a genius.
Remember who found him.

53:44.604 --> 53:46.595
Wonderboy changed the lyrics, man.

53:46.740 --> 53:49.800
It's sounding better, honestly.
It's still good quality.

53:49.943 --> 53:51.934
Well, it sounds good.
He's got a good voice.

53:52.078 --> 53:54.876
But it's not the same.
I mean, he changed all the lyrics.

54:19.572 --> 54:23.508
- Do you want one?
- No, I'm cool.

54:25.578 --> 54:29.309
She's pretty.
What is she, like seventeen?

54:29.449 --> 54:31.940
Eighteen, I think.

54:32.786 --> 54:35.914
- Is that her BMW outside?
- Yeah.

54:39.526 --> 54:41.118
Anyway...

54:41.194 --> 54:44.652
...I just came by to get my stuff...

54:46.933 --> 54:49.527
...and thank you.
- Thank me?

54:50.270 --> 54:52.329
Are you really gonna thank me?

54:53.873 --> 54:55.864
What do you mean?

54:56.009 --> 55:00.469
I don't know. I guess I just thought
this would turn into something more.

55:01.147 --> 55:03.138
You staying here.

55:10.290 --> 55:14.226
Yeah, okay.
But I want some pot.

55:23.803 --> 55:25.794
- Hey.
- Hey.

55:27.707 --> 55:31.040
I gotta help Nathan with something.

55:31.177 --> 55:35.238
So I'll... I should get a ride
back to your place later.

55:36.449 --> 55:38.917
- No, I'll wait for you.
- No.

55:40.387 --> 55:42.514
That's not gonna work.

55:50.263 --> 55:52.390
I'll see you in a couple hours.

56:05.945 --> 56:08.607
<i>- Greetings, soldier.</i>
<i>- Greetings, my friend.</i>

56:08.748 --> 56:11.148
<i>I hail from the Kirklactic Empire.</i>

56:11.284 --> 56:14.048
<i>I've heard quite a
bit about that place.</i>

56:14.554 --> 56:17.284
<i>We've penetrated</i>
<i>the far reaches of space.</i>

56:17.424 --> 56:20.018
<i>You've penetrated everything</i>
<i>you've come in contact with...</i>

56:20.160 --> 56:22.151
<i>... according to my sources.</i>

56:37.911 --> 56:39.572
<i>Studio.</i>

56:39.712 --> 56:43.307
Yeah. Hi.
I'd like to model.

56:43.450 --> 56:46.222
<i>You and everyone
else in this town.</i>

56:46.223 --> 56:47.318
<i>Come on in.</i>

56:52.125 --> 56:55.151
- What the hell is going on?
- Hey, come on back here.

56:55.328 --> 56:56.259
It's an amateur site.

56:56.260 --> 56:58.786
Half of the pictures I receive
are from fans of the site.

56:58.932 --> 57:03.733
They send in pictures of ex-girlfriends,
strippers, girls they saw on the beach.

57:03.870 --> 57:07.533
- Isn't that illegal?
- When they hit the return button...

57:07.674 --> 57:12.270
...they agree they have the rights to the
pictures, and it's no longer my problem.

57:12.412 --> 57:15.540
So do you know
who sent you those photos?

57:15.715 --> 57:16.591
All right, look.

57:16.592 --> 57:19.549
I'll take them off the site, okay?
Just give me $5000.

57:19.686 --> 57:21.677
They're one of the most popular
set of pictures on the site.

57:21.821 --> 57:24.016
Yeah, fine.

57:24.157 --> 57:27.354
- Two thousand.
- Honey, he just agreed to five.

57:27.494 --> 57:30.361
If you wanna renegotiate,
the price is gonna go up.

57:30.497 --> 57:32.423
All right, look.
I know who you are.

57:32.424 --> 57:34.558
I read the real estate
section on Sundays.

57:35.034 --> 57:38.231
Actually, I was maybe gonna
talk to you about my house.

57:38.371 --> 57:41.169
Tell me, do you think
this is a good time to sell, or...?

57:47.780 --> 57:49.372
Call my office.

57:49.549 --> 57:52.518
Wow. Who took the picture?

57:52.652 --> 57:55.917
I could do a much better job,
Sally St. Clair.

57:56.589 --> 57:59.524
- If you change your mind, call me.
- Thank you.

57:59.659 --> 58:02.594
As you see,
that's only some of my work.

58:03.463 --> 58:06.330
- Sorry about the stairs.
- No problem.

58:06.466 --> 58:07.933
Nice... I like your stuff.

58:17.210 --> 58:20.145
- You're early.
- Yeah, well...

58:20.280 --> 58:22.510
I didn't know how long this would take.

58:23.616 --> 58:27.074
- Where do you live?
- I'm staying with my cousin right now.

58:27.220 --> 58:31.418
But I wanna get my own place soon.
I'm saving up some money.

58:31.758 --> 58:33.885
Well, I can help you out with that.

58:35.228 --> 58:37.508
Go get me a large,
non-fat latte, extra hot.

58:37.509 --> 58:39.028
And get something for yourself.

58:39.165 --> 58:40.564
Okay.

58:42.902 --> 58:46.360
Becky? Hello, Becky.

58:46.506 --> 58:48.497
Unlock this door, young lady.

58:48.641 --> 58:51.474
- Shh, be quiet.
- Is someone in there with you?

58:51.644 --> 58:53.005
I heard voices last night.

58:53.006 --> 58:55.307
You're not allowed to
keep this door locked.

58:55.448 --> 58:57.439
What are you talking about?
It's unlocked.

59:09.195 --> 59:10.662
April?

59:14.467 --> 59:16.594
What are you doing here?

59:17.737 --> 59:21.229
- Sally, she offered me a job.
- A job? What job? My job?

59:21.541 --> 59:25.136
Nathan. This is our new intern, April.

59:25.945 --> 59:28.641
- Nathan. It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you too.

59:28.815 --> 59:31.340
You know, you look really familiar to me.

59:32.852 --> 59:36.515
- Do you two know each other?
- I don't think so.

59:36.689 --> 59:39.283
Maybe I've just seen a picture of you
someplace, then.

59:39.425 --> 59:42.519
No. I don't think so.

59:45.765 --> 59:48.165
I told April she could stay at your
place for a couple of days.

59:48.301 --> 59:51.429
No really, that's okay.
I can just go stay at my cousin's.

59:51.604 --> 59:53.629
And sleep on the sofa? No.

59:53.773 --> 59:57.903
It's fine. We have an extra bedroom.
It's no problem. Right, Nathan?

59:58.678 --> 01:00:00.669
Of course not.

01:00:01.981 --> 01:00:06.315
Sally St. Clair's office.
Postcard in the mail?

01:00:06.452 --> 01:00:09.444
Okay, enough small talk. Nathan,
I'm sure you can keep April busy.

01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:11.716
I'll do my best.
What are you doing here?

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:14.986
I ran into Sally at a coffee shop.
I was applying for a job.

01:00:15.128 --> 01:00:16.527
Sally St. Clair's office.

01:00:16.663 --> 01:00:19.325
I don't know what's going on,
but you find your own apartment.

01:00:19.465 --> 01:00:21.524
Can you hold please?
Thank you.

01:00:23.469 --> 01:00:27.337
Carlos.
Hi, it's me, Becky.

01:00:27.473 --> 01:00:30.806
Listen, I need you
to do something for me...

01:00:36.482 --> 01:00:39.883
This neighborhood is a little sketch,
but you can crash here for a while.

01:00:53.633 --> 01:00:55.489
Carlos said he would be here.

01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:58.434
Dude's a real stoner,
so anything is possible.

01:01:02.842 --> 01:01:05.037
I just talked to him.

01:01:13.586 --> 01:01:16.851
Yo, Becky. What's up?

01:01:16.989 --> 01:01:18.980
Carlos, you reek.

01:01:19.325 --> 01:01:22.192
Just doin' some B-52s.
Did you guys want one?

01:01:22.662 --> 01:01:24.721
No. But it smells like some good shit.

01:01:24.864 --> 01:01:26.991
Yeah. Some dude out of Diamond Bar.

01:01:27.133 --> 01:01:29.795
Hydroponic,
featured in <i>High Times.</i>

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:33.929
I mean, everybody's going crazy for it.
I'm just lucky I got it.

01:01:36.209 --> 01:01:38.939
Dude, take the trash out
every once in a while.

01:01:39.078 --> 01:01:41.273
I know.

01:01:42.281 --> 01:01:44.772
I've been really, really busy.

01:01:57.463 --> 01:02:00.330
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:04.960
- You left me to lock up the office.
- I asked Sally if I could go.

01:02:05.638 --> 01:02:09.597
Look, you're the low man
on the totem pole, okay? You ask me.

01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:11.735
Okay.
Now can I take my fucking shower?

01:02:12.712 --> 01:02:14.703
Yeah, sure.

01:02:14.847 --> 01:02:16.838
Finish your shower.

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:19.417
You better not use my washcloth, okay?

01:02:25.792 --> 01:02:28.852
So you're the guy
responsible for all of this.

01:02:29.662 --> 01:02:33.530
You're really not supposed to be in here.
But no, I'm not responsible for all this.

01:02:33.666 --> 01:02:35.793
There's a guy that comes by
a couple times a week...

01:02:35.935 --> 01:02:38.335
...to make sure everything's
doing what it's supposed to.

01:02:38.738 --> 01:02:40.729
I just kinda like spraying 'em.

01:02:42.141 --> 01:02:44.132
It relaxes me.

01:02:52.618 --> 01:02:55.815
Sorry, do you want a couple buds?

01:02:56.155 --> 01:02:59.682
Sure. Yeah, yeah.
That'd be great.

01:03:01.761 --> 01:03:05.697
Here you go.
Let it dry out for a couple days first.

01:03:05.898 --> 01:03:07.525
Wow.

01:03:18.177 --> 01:03:20.702
This is some good stuff, man.

01:03:22.048 --> 01:03:25.711
- Where'd you get it?
- This cat I know.

01:03:26.519 --> 01:03:29.920
You get some more of this stuff, man,
I want some.

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:33.253
Turn the fuckin' music down, man!

01:03:33.392 --> 01:03:36.850
- So, what's Becky's story?
- She's a sweetheart, man.

01:03:36.996 --> 01:03:41.296
I mean, her dad's, like,
this really rich guy. He's never home.

01:03:42.201 --> 01:03:43.862
She's into me.

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:50.573
We met in this creative writing class.

01:03:50.743 --> 01:03:53.075
She really likes my poetry.

01:03:57.817 --> 01:04:02.151
I wanna go to fuckin' sleep, man!
Turn the fuckin' music off!

01:04:02.288 --> 01:04:06.418
- It's warm.
- Don't worry about it. Fridge is broke.

01:04:08.828 --> 01:04:11.353
What do you think you can get
for that weed, man?

01:04:12.164 --> 01:04:14.155
I don't know, man.

01:04:15.034 --> 01:04:17.025
A lot of money.

01:04:17.169 --> 01:04:20.161
This is, like,
the best stuff I've smoked in years.

01:04:21.173 --> 01:04:23.300
I smoke a lot of pot.

01:04:24.977 --> 01:04:28.037
So do you know "Free Bird"?

01:04:28.714 --> 01:04:32.514
Fucking Christ! Turn it off!

01:04:32.685 --> 01:04:34.676
Come on, let's smile now.
Come on.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:38.312
Look like you're enjoying it,
all right? Yeah.

01:04:38.457 --> 01:04:40.448
Okay, isn't that enough?

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:44.193
You said you'd let me
take some pictures. Come on.

01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:47.198
This has nothing to do with real estate.

01:04:48.801 --> 01:04:50.928
How's that tape treating you?

01:04:51.671 --> 01:04:54.936
I transferred it to my computer
so I can edit it.

01:04:57.143 --> 01:04:59.134
Do I get a copy?

01:04:59.278 --> 01:05:01.269
Do you want a copy?

01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:06.942
- I'll get back to you on that.
- Oh, okay.

01:05:10.756 --> 01:05:12.815
You know, my girlfriend moved out.

01:05:15.761 --> 01:05:17.228
That was sudden.

01:05:17.363 --> 01:05:21.163
We haven't had sex for six months,
so that's not really.

01:05:24.036 --> 01:05:27.836
Are you one of those freaks that can
only get off on tapes and everything?

01:05:31.243 --> 01:05:34.576
I don't know what came first:
My lack of interest in her...

01:05:34.714 --> 01:05:37.410
...or my complete obsession with you.

01:05:47.126 --> 01:05:49.321
It's good I get into bed early tonight.

01:05:49.462 --> 01:05:52.192
I got a yoga class in the morning.

01:05:53.466 --> 01:05:56.867
- I was that young.
- Younger.

01:05:58.871 --> 01:06:00.930
Yeah, you're right.

01:06:01.107 --> 01:06:03.667
- You do yoga?
- Yeah.

01:06:04.276 --> 01:06:06.073
Birkram.

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:09.238
- Can you unlock the door?
- You know, you sweat. You're sweaty.

01:06:10.683 --> 01:06:15.017
Wait, wait, wait. Let him
get to the bottom of the street first.

01:06:15.821 --> 01:06:19.279
And don't turn on the lights
'til they get out of the hills.

01:06:47.653 --> 01:06:50.087
- He's not gonna walk her to the door.
- This is great.

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:53.054
He's waiting for her to get in.
Now's our chance. Just follow me.

01:06:53.192 --> 01:06:56.650
- Wait. What's the plan?
- Just stick with me.

01:07:04.737 --> 01:07:08.138
Hey! What?
No, no! What the fuck?

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:13.871
Who are you, man? What do
you want? What are you doing?

01:07:14.013 --> 01:07:16.481
- Shut up.
- Stop.

01:07:19.385 --> 01:07:22.411
We've got a little surprise
for you, David.

01:07:25.725 --> 01:07:28.489
Now I'm gonna pull you into the car.

01:07:28.627 --> 01:07:31.027
If you try anything, I'll break
your fucking neck. You got that?

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:24.072
- It's my favorite song.
- I can tell.

01:08:27.419 --> 01:08:30.411
- Where are you going?
- My cousin, she invited me to a dinner.

01:08:30.555 --> 01:08:33.116
It's a congratulations
for me getting a new job.

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:35.984
You want?

01:08:37.095 --> 01:08:41.555
They're gonna give me shit.
But I don't care.

01:08:43.903 --> 01:08:46.098
I knew Sally was gonna
find somebody else.

01:08:46.238 --> 01:08:49.104
I'm too stoned all the time.
I'm fucking shit up.

01:08:49.241 --> 01:08:51.232
It's exactly what happened
to the last guy.

01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:53.401
Oh, don't say that.

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:56.174
Maybe you should just stop smoking
every night, and mellow out.

01:08:56.314 --> 01:08:59.375
You think I care about this job?
You think I wanna work in real estate?

01:08:59.518 --> 01:09:02.180
I mean, every other person...
Nobody knows what they want.

01:09:02.321 --> 01:09:04.312
It's like, if they want a house
with a sauna...

01:09:04.456 --> 01:09:06.447
...the full bedroom
can have only partial light.

01:09:06.591 --> 01:09:08.054
But Mrs. Son-of-a-Bitch
can't sleep

01:09:08.055 --> 01:09:09.720
unless there's a lot
of light in the room.

01:09:09.862 --> 01:09:13.821
Mr. Son-of-a-Bitch can't sleep because
there's too much light in the room.

01:09:13.999 --> 01:09:16.399
It's like Goldilocks grew up
and got married.

01:09:16.535 --> 01:09:19.662
And all of a sudden,
nobody knows what they want anymore.

01:09:19.805 --> 01:09:23.536
That's not what I want.
I mean, you wanna work in real estate?

01:09:25.511 --> 01:09:27.911
I don't even really know
what I wanna do.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:31.810
Me, I came out here to be a dancer.

01:09:33.819 --> 01:09:37.948
Like I was gonna be one of those people
poppin' in the Missy Elliott videos.

01:09:39.358 --> 01:09:40.916
Funny, huh?

01:09:43.028 --> 01:09:44.859
You know, we should go dancing.

01:09:46.165 --> 01:09:49.622
- No, I don't wanna go dancing.
- Come on, I'm in my party dress.

01:09:49.801 --> 01:09:51.929
What about your cousin?

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:54.998
You think I really wanna see them
making out?

01:09:56.909 --> 01:09:59.036
Okay, okay.

01:09:59.211 --> 01:10:01.839
Come, come. Come on.

01:10:02.014 --> 01:10:03.191
<i>Since the mid-1990s,</i>

01:10:03.192 --> 01:10:05.108
<i>the central government
of Botswana...</i>

01:10:05.251 --> 01:10:08.448
<i>... has been trying
to put Bushmen out...</i>

01:10:08.587 --> 01:10:11.305
<i>... even though the
National Constitution</i>

01:10:11.306 --> 01:10:13.524
<i>guarantees the
people the right...</i>

01:10:13.659 --> 01:10:15.991
Do you hear something, man?

01:10:20.132 --> 01:10:22.794
Yeah. I got it.

01:10:23.936 --> 01:10:26.928
<i>Geographic</i> just, like, kills it.

01:10:27.072 --> 01:10:28.801
Hotties.

01:10:31.076 --> 01:10:33.567
- Hello?
- <i>What are you doing?</i>

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.872
- Nothing, really.
- <i>Well, who are you with?</i>

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:42.943
- Just hanging with Carlos.
- <i>Carlos?</i>

01:10:43.889 --> 01:10:46.413
Is he telling you
my deep, dark secrets?

01:10:46.414 --> 01:10:48.383
<i>No, nothing like that.</i>

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:55.095
<i>I miss you.</i>
<i>Do you miss me?</i>

01:10:55.234 --> 01:10:56.701
Sure.

01:10:57.736 --> 01:11:00.569
No. I wanna hear you say it.

01:11:00.706 --> 01:11:02.731
I want you to say it in front of Carlos.

01:11:02.908 --> 01:11:05.570
I just farted, man.
Can you smell it?

01:11:08.781 --> 01:11:12.717
I... I miss you.

01:11:15.721 --> 01:11:17.712
Do you want me to come over?

01:11:19.591 --> 01:11:22.788
Sure, I guess. What are we gonna do,
sleep on the floor?

01:11:22.962 --> 01:11:25.624
I don't care.
I just wanna see you.

01:11:26.065 --> 01:11:28.056
You're pussy-whipped, dude.

01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:34.603
Okay. I'll see you soon.

01:11:38.811 --> 01:11:40.802
You asshole.

01:11:46.485 --> 01:11:48.612
What are you watching?

01:11:48.754 --> 01:11:51.621
<i>Geographic</i>, dude. No lie.

01:11:51.757 --> 01:11:53.884
Hot chicks.

01:12:12.644 --> 01:12:16.307
Hey. Hope that didn't hurt too much.

01:12:16.482 --> 01:12:17.915
Asshole.

01:12:23.856 --> 01:12:26.324
Davey. You know why we're here?

01:12:28.527 --> 01:12:32.122
Come over here, Sally.
Come on over.

01:12:32.865 --> 01:12:34.992
Okay, Dave.

01:12:35.134 --> 01:12:38.797
Why the fuck are her pictures up
on the Internet, huh?

01:12:40.272 --> 01:12:41.864
See this?

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:51.338
I'm gonna pull this ball gag out of
your mouth. But if you try anything...

01:12:51.483 --> 01:12:54.884
...I'm gonna hit you so hard,
you'll lose your hearing. You got that?

01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:56.487
All right.

01:12:57.289 --> 01:13:01.350
- Jesus, Sally. What is this?
- Where are the pictures?

01:13:01.493 --> 01:13:03.552
- What pictures?
- All of 'em.

01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:06.830
Of Sally. Of everyone.

01:13:07.499 --> 01:13:11.026
I want all the pictures,
you fuckin' pervert.

01:13:11.437 --> 01:13:12.532
I don't know who you are,

01:13:12.533 --> 01:13:14.372
or what it is that
you think you're doing.

01:13:14.506 --> 01:13:17.566
He is my friend.
And he's here to help me.

01:13:17.709 --> 01:13:20.439
Now, I want all the pictures
you've taken of me.

01:13:20.979 --> 01:13:24.745
You see, Davey, some of those pictures
ended up on the Internet.

01:13:24.917 --> 01:13:28.683
Sure. I mean, whatever.
Take all the pictures.

01:13:28.854 --> 01:13:32.255
And I want three of your listings.

01:13:32.858 --> 01:13:35.053
Three of your houses
that you have on the market.

01:13:35.227 --> 01:13:37.320
Come on, how can I do that?

01:13:37.463 --> 01:13:41.194
Call 'em up and say
you can't help them anymore.

01:13:41.333 --> 01:13:43.597
A medical problem.

01:13:43.735 --> 01:13:45.726
And that you recommend me.

01:13:46.138 --> 01:13:48.368
You don't think
you're gonna get away with this, do ya?

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:52.135
With all the underage girls you parade
through here for photo shoots?

01:13:52.277 --> 01:13:56.008
What are you, gonna go to the cops?
I don't think so.

01:13:56.148 --> 01:13:58.946
Honey, what are you doing
with a guy like that?

01:13:59.751 --> 01:14:01.878
What was I doing
with a guy like you, huh?

01:14:03.021 --> 01:14:05.751
I'm always looking
for someone to help me.

01:14:05.891 --> 01:14:07.722
You know what Dad was like.

01:14:09.294 --> 01:14:12.752
This is some good stuff.
You're very talented.

01:14:12.931 --> 01:14:15.729
Yeah, thank you. Asshole.

01:14:16.969 --> 01:14:19.529
- Are my photos in there?
- Well, there's lots of boxes.

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:22.435
We'll just have to take it all.

01:14:30.048 --> 01:14:32.039
I love this song.

01:14:33.652 --> 01:14:36.849
- So, what's your story?
- Oh, my story?

01:14:37.923 --> 01:14:41.450
I'm from Lincoln Nebraska,
and I was raised by my grandma.

01:14:41.593 --> 01:14:44.338
And my only friend in high
school joined the Army.

01:14:44.339 --> 01:14:45.791
So I had to get outta there.

01:14:45.931 --> 01:14:47.922
No...

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.791
I mean...

01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:53.461
Do you like girls?

01:14:54.673 --> 01:14:56.937
Yeah, I like girls.

01:14:57.075 --> 01:14:59.066
Do you like me?

01:15:00.479 --> 01:15:02.071
Yeah, I like you.

01:15:05.217 --> 01:15:08.345
Do you like guys
more than you like girls?

01:15:18.263 --> 01:15:20.527
Come on, Little Miss Missy.
Learn how to dance.

01:15:20.699 --> 01:15:24.601
Just give me a second, okay?
I'm not exactly used to this sort of...

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:27.637
- Excuses, excuses.
- You just gotta give me a minute, okay?

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:38.477
Yeah, go. Peace.
Bye! Have fun.

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.751
Follow me.

01:16:40.312 --> 01:16:42.303
You don't like guys.

01:16:44.316 --> 01:16:46.307
Are you some frat boy fucking with me?

01:16:46.451 --> 01:16:49.181
No, man.
I never even went to college.

01:16:49.354 --> 01:16:52.380
Where do you think you're going, man?
Stay there.

01:16:52.524 --> 01:16:54.719
I didn't come in here for nothing.

01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:31.052
You can't stay here.

01:17:32.097 --> 01:17:34.565
It's fine, don't worry about it.

01:17:36.568 --> 01:17:39.503
No, this place is gross.

01:17:39.638 --> 01:17:41.367
I'll clean it up.

01:17:43.842 --> 01:17:47.972
How can you be inspired to write
anything beautiful in a place like this?

01:17:49.381 --> 01:17:51.576
Just leave that to me.

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:53.642
No.

01:17:55.253 --> 01:17:59.155
I found you.
You're my discovery.

01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:03.951
Hey. Can I get a large, non-fat latte...

01:18:04.129 --> 01:18:06.654
...and a regular, small coffee.

01:18:07.199 --> 01:18:09.190
Okay. That'll be $5.65.

01:18:32.290 --> 01:18:36.021
Good morning.
Didn't I see you at the coffee shop?

01:18:36.361 --> 01:18:37.726
Yeah.

01:18:40.232 --> 01:18:44.066
- Is Sally here?
- Yeah. What was your name?

01:18:44.236 --> 01:18:45.999
I'm Todd.

01:18:47.305 --> 01:18:49.136
- April.
- April.

01:18:49.841 --> 01:18:53.504
Nice to meet you. You're a bit young
to be doing this, aren't you?

01:18:53.678 --> 01:18:57.478
Why would you say that?
I mean, Sally says I'm doing a great job.

01:18:58.817 --> 01:19:01.149
I'm just kidding with you.
I'm just...

01:19:02.053 --> 01:19:04.180
Todd, is it?

01:19:04.322 --> 01:19:06.313
- It is.
- Come back, please.

01:19:06.458 --> 01:19:08.187
Bye. Nice to meet you.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.453
Very professional.

01:19:11.463 --> 01:19:13.658
Very impressive.

01:19:13.932 --> 01:19:16.400
I just got a call
from one of Davey's clients.

01:19:16.535 --> 01:19:19.663
- Oh, good.
- He's going down.

01:19:20.672 --> 01:19:23.402
Hey, what do you wanna do
with the pictures?

01:19:23.575 --> 01:19:27.067
You can keep 'em.
Do what you want with them.

01:19:27.212 --> 01:19:29.476
I know you're a total perv.

01:19:32.818 --> 01:19:34.217
Yeah.

01:19:35.687 --> 01:19:37.518
What are you looking at?

01:19:38.156 --> 01:19:41.353
I was looking at April.

01:19:47.632 --> 01:19:49.896
What do you think?
I love it.

01:19:51.636 --> 01:19:53.627
I look like a douchebag in these clothes.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.840
You look great,
and you are so not a douchebag.

01:19:59.578 --> 01:20:01.842
Come on, let's just go.
We're gonna be late.

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:05.848
Sammy. We're gonna go.
You look great.

01:20:07.519 --> 01:20:10.181
Sabrina, don't listen to him.
We'll take it.

01:20:13.158 --> 01:20:15.619
Call me tomorrow, and
we'll figure it out.

01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:16.821
I gotta call you back.

01:20:19.664 --> 01:20:22.497
- I thought you were sick.
- Hung over.

01:20:24.636 --> 01:20:26.900
Those are the keys
to the house and the car.

01:20:27.873 --> 01:20:30.740
What's happening, Nathan?

01:20:30.876 --> 01:20:33.743
I'm moving back to Nebraska.

01:20:33.912 --> 01:20:37.939
Nebraska?
Why would you wanna do that?

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:40.278
I'm done. I talked to my dad...

01:20:40.418 --> 01:20:42.716
...and he said he'd help me
with school next semester.

01:20:42.854 --> 01:20:44.845
I'm just not cut out
for Hollywood and all this.

01:20:45.023 --> 01:20:46.547
You can't quit.

01:20:46.691 --> 01:20:49.159
You're always one step ahead
of everybody.

01:20:49.294 --> 01:20:51.819
I mean, that's why you got
April in here, isn't it?

01:20:54.833 --> 01:20:56.824
Yeah, you're right.

01:21:00.972 --> 01:21:04.373
You know, out of all the screwups
I've had...

01:21:04.509 --> 01:21:08.673
...you had days
when you almost got everything right.

01:21:09.314 --> 01:21:13.808
Well, I'd like to think that today
is one of those days. Thanks, Sally.

01:21:57.629 --> 01:21:58.960
Thanks.

01:22:09.441 --> 01:22:11.375
Hey.

01:22:11.509 --> 01:22:13.238
Call me.

01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:27.581
It's your day, big boy.

01:22:27.759 --> 01:22:29.784
Second page, sign under "artist".

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:50.671
I left her with you.

01:22:51.416 --> 01:22:53.611
Don't fucking touch me.
Where is she?

01:22:53.752 --> 01:22:55.743
I don't know.

01:22:57.555 --> 01:22:59.580
What was the last time you saw her?

01:23:29.854 --> 01:23:32.254
- We love these.
- Yeah, we wanna do a show.

01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:34.722
We're looking for
something for this fall.

01:23:36.594 --> 01:23:39.461
- What do you think?
- Yeah, okay.

01:23:39.597 --> 01:23:41.588
We'll do it.
They wanna show my stuff.

01:23:41.733 --> 01:23:43.724
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:23:43.868 --> 01:23:45.927
- That's cool, huh?
- Yeah.

01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:53.335
No, no, that one's just being leased.
Hold on.

01:23:53.478 --> 01:23:57.278
Hey. Do you like that picture?

01:23:59.017 --> 01:24:02.180
- Do you think I look sexy enough?
- You're a pretty sexy lady.

01:24:02.353 --> 01:24:04.344
Yeah, I am.

01:24:05.023 --> 01:24:08.015
Wow, that's beautiful.
Beautiful. Yes.

01:24:08.159 --> 01:24:11.686
Okay, now look at me like you want me.

01:24:12.697 --> 01:24:16.633
Come on, tell me that
you want me. Come on, Sally.

01:24:17.168 --> 01:24:19.636
Wow, that's beautiful.
Beautiful.

01:24:19.771 --> 01:24:23.070
Yes, I like the attitude.
That works. That was good.

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.007
Hey,
you need a ride?

01:24:38.723 --> 01:24:41.191
- Where you going?
- Hop in.

01:24:41.793 --> 01:24:43.818
I'll take you any place you wanna go.

01:24:54.472 --> 01:24:57.737
Put your seatbelt on.
You been waiting long?

01:26:57.738 --> 01:26:58.738
