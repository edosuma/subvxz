WEBVTT

00:02.132 --> 00:04.178
[J'onn]
Lex is building
a Lexosuit army?

00:04.221 --> 00:06.789
Apparently, it's a gift
to help ingratiate himself
with Nyxly,

00:06.832 --> 00:09.444
and to help defeat you guys
and get the Totems.

00:09.487 --> 00:11.228
And Otis told you
this in an alley?

00:11.272 --> 00:13.317
I convinced him to meet
by offering to keep

00:13.361 --> 00:15.841
whatever he said on deep
background, but he wanted
to go on the record.

00:15.885 --> 00:18.714
I got the impression that
his bromance with Lex
is rocky.

00:18.757 --> 00:21.978
What if Otis spilling the tea
is just another one of
Lex's tricks?

00:22.022 --> 00:24.328
Then we just
use that to our
advantage.

00:24.372 --> 00:27.636
I can create a data
interception program to track
Lex through the Lexosuits.

00:27.679 --> 00:30.291
-We'll know where he is soon.
-That's great, Lena.

00:30.334 --> 00:31.988
Listen, I know
the timing's not ideal,

00:32.032 --> 00:34.208
but I got a call
from my friend
at Club Rialto,

00:34.251 --> 00:36.384
and she said
that her VIP suite

00:36.427 --> 00:38.560
is available for your
bachelorette party,
if you want it.

00:38.603 --> 00:40.301
-Nice.
-Tonight.

00:40.344 --> 00:41.650
Tonight?

00:41.693 --> 00:43.304
-Uh, I--
-[Supergirl] Alex!

00:43.347 --> 00:46.002
Life is unpredictable.
The world is unpredictable.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.135
There will always
be a threat.

00:48.178 --> 00:50.267
You have to seize the joy
when you can.

00:50.311 --> 00:52.052
Come on.
I can keep everyone
safe.

00:52.878 --> 00:54.228
[exhales]

00:54.271 --> 00:56.491
-[all] Do it! Do it!
-Oh, my God! Stop.

00:56.534 --> 00:58.667
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's do it, let's do it.
Okay.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.538
-We're doing this. Okay.
-[cell phone chimes]

01:03.324 --> 01:04.934
Oh.

01:04.977 --> 01:07.328
Oh, no.
Esme had some trouble
at school.

01:07.371 --> 01:11.158
She's okay.
Um, Kelly is gonna
pick her up. I should go.

01:11.201 --> 01:13.029
-We got this. Go, go, go.
-[Supergirl] Shoo.

01:14.683 --> 01:15.771
[cellphone chimes]

01:18.426 --> 01:19.514
Everything okay, William?

01:19.557 --> 01:22.517
Turn on channel two.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.910
[Dana]
Y'all are not gonna believe
these love poems

01:24.954 --> 01:26.695
from billionaire Lex Luthor.

01:26.738 --> 01:29.001
"I will make oceans burn

01:29.045 --> 01:30.786
The skies above turn black

01:30.829 --> 01:33.397
We shall rule together,
my love,

01:33.441 --> 01:36.313
Cruel deaths
to any who attack."

01:36.357 --> 01:38.402
It seems CatCo reporter
William Dey

01:38.446 --> 01:41.057
has leaked
Lex's private journal.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.537
[Dana]
How'd he get
his hands on it?

01:42.580 --> 01:44.539
I need to go.

01:44.582 --> 01:46.541
[Derek]
Who knows? But in it,
the Man of Tomorrow

01:46.584 --> 01:50.458
professes his love for Nyxly,
the Fifth Dimensional imp...

01:50.501 --> 01:53.025
Hey, they're talking
about you.

01:53.069 --> 01:56.072
Now, she's allegedly behind
some of the most violent
attacks on the city.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.292
[Dana]
Derek, I know the heart wants
what the heart wants,

01:58.335 --> 02:01.077
but it seems
Lex Luthor's heart
wants a psychopath.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.209
[laughter]

02:02.252 --> 02:03.906
They haven't even
met me yet.

02:03.949 --> 02:05.864
[Derek] What's next?
A cutsie couple name?

02:05.908 --> 02:08.302
I know, Lexly.

02:08.345 --> 02:12.741
I'll nail gun their
drivel-spouting tongues
to their pinheads.

02:12.784 --> 02:16.745
Looks like someone
should have hidden
his diary a little better.

02:16.788 --> 02:19.574
What is it they called you?
The Man of Tomorrow?

02:19.617 --> 02:23.143
Quite a lofty title.
Did you give yourself
that name?

02:23.186 --> 02:28.452
Truth be told, I actually
quite like the part about...
the burning oceans.

02:30.280 --> 02:34.806
In actual news, I've started
work on your Lexosuit army.

02:34.850 --> 02:36.982
-I can show you
what I've done so far.
-Not now.

02:37.026 --> 02:40.595
The crystal ball still hasn't
shown me where
the truth totem is.

02:40.638 --> 02:42.031
So much
for your fixing it.

02:43.075 --> 02:44.947
[speaking Spanish]

02:51.475 --> 02:52.389
[chuckles]

02:52.433 --> 02:53.434
[continues in Spanish]

02:54.783 --> 02:57.438
You had no right
using my byline.

02:57.481 --> 03:00.571
Your name adds veracity.
Cache.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.269
This is my reputation.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.967
You used my name
to validate
an unethical story,

03:05.010 --> 03:06.534
something you'd see
in a gossip rag.

03:06.577 --> 03:10.146
The journal
is the proof that
you wanted.

03:11.147 --> 03:12.757
Lex is working with Nyxly.

03:12.801 --> 03:15.456
Yes, but this
makes them look
like a joke.

03:15.499 --> 03:18.981
And in doing so, people may
forget how dangerous
they really are.

03:19.024 --> 03:21.113
We're taking Lex down.

03:21.157 --> 03:23.246
Why does it matter how?

03:23.290 --> 03:29.034
I became a journalist
to tell real stories,
to report the truth.

03:29.078 --> 03:32.647
Your "ends justify the means"
excuse makes you
just as bad as Lex.

03:32.690 --> 03:35.302
You both have
no ethical code.

03:35.345 --> 03:39.828
I was hoping that you'd
wield CatCo's power
and influence for good,

03:39.871 --> 03:46.008
but instead, your
pathological obsession
to be number one

03:46.051 --> 03:48.793
made you selfish
and shortsighted.

03:48.837 --> 03:52.797
What's important
is what you stand for,

03:52.841 --> 03:55.496
what you contribute
to make the world
a better place.

03:56.975 --> 04:02.372
And you, Andrea Rojas,
stand for nothing.

04:06.768 --> 04:09.031
[Brainy]
Your intel has been most
informative, Winn.

04:09.074 --> 04:11.555
What was this personal matter
you wish to discuss?

04:11.599 --> 04:13.078
[beeping, whirring]

04:20.129 --> 04:21.261
Yes.

04:22.653 --> 04:23.828
Yes, I understand.

04:27.919 --> 04:30.139
Lex's obsequious devotion
to Nyxly,

04:30.182 --> 04:32.794
his selfless behavior
sacrificing the Love Totem,

04:32.837 --> 04:35.753
all confirm what I just learned
in my call
with the 31st century.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.712
You called the future?

04:37.755 --> 04:40.280
So, in the future,
Lex and Nyxly are quite
the power couple.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.847
It's hard to imagine Lex
loving anyone as much as
he loves himself.

04:42.891 --> 04:45.502
Be that as it may,
after obtaining
all seven Totems,

04:45.546 --> 04:47.374
Lex and Nyxly completed
the AllStone,

04:47.417 --> 04:49.767
and anointed themselves
King and Queen of the universe.

04:49.811 --> 04:52.335
But for reasons still unknown,
the AllStone began to fail.

04:52.379 --> 04:54.381
The Legion saw this
as their chance to attack...

04:55.382 --> 04:56.600
and Nyxly died.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.341
That must be why
Lex is so desperate

04:58.385 --> 04:59.951
to help her get
all the Totems
in this time.

04:59.995 --> 05:01.910
But the Hope and Love Totems
have been destroyed.

05:01.953 --> 05:04.173
There's no way to complete
the AllStone without them.

05:04.216 --> 05:05.566
Still, if he's in love,

05:05.609 --> 05:07.089
there's no telling
what he'll do for Nyxly.

05:07.132 --> 05:08.133
[computer chimes]

05:08.873 --> 05:10.658
It worked.

05:10.701 --> 05:12.964
We tracked the Lexosuits
and Naxim's ship
to the waterfront.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.406
Intruder alert.

05:19.449 --> 05:20.407
[automated voice]
Intruder alert.

05:20.450 --> 05:21.756
Get the Dream Totem.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.543
[Supergirl]
That's impossible.

05:26.587 --> 05:27.457
The Hope Totem?

05:34.899 --> 05:35.944
Sweet dreams.

05:37.859 --> 05:38.686
[Supergirl grunts]

05:41.645 --> 05:43.604
Dreamer, can you close
the dream portal?

05:43.647 --> 05:44.605
[Dreamer]
I'm trying!

05:47.129 --> 05:48.086
I got the Dream Totem.

05:48.130 --> 05:49.131
No.

05:58.662 --> 06:00.055
[grunting]

06:00.098 --> 06:01.970
Fast thinking, Dreamer.

06:02.013 --> 06:04.407
-Naxim's ship, it's gone.
-[Brainy] But we have this.

06:17.028 --> 06:19.074
How does Nyxly have
the Hope Totem?

06:19.117 --> 06:21.032
I threw it into the sun.

06:21.076 --> 06:23.426
Evidently, the Totems' powers
are so potent

06:23.470 --> 06:24.427
and elemental in nature,

06:24.471 --> 06:26.386
they can't be destroyed.

06:26.429 --> 06:28.605
They only reconstitute
in a new form.

06:28.649 --> 06:31.173
I can use the Dream Totem
to help me pinpoint
the ship's location

06:31.216 --> 06:32.957
while Lena retracks
the Lexosuits.

06:33.001 --> 06:34.611
Brainy, can you find out
anything else from the future

06:34.655 --> 06:37.658
that might help us...
speed things along?

06:37.701 --> 06:39.094
Yes, of course.

06:40.922 --> 06:44.665
Should want to
speed things up.

06:44.708 --> 06:48.451
All your arrogant boastings
about your insights
into the future,

06:48.495 --> 06:51.411
and yet,
you didn't see
this coming.

06:51.454 --> 06:53.630
Your needs are
my raison d'etre.

06:53.674 --> 06:57.025
You get all the Totems
very soon,
but you have to be patient.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.635
I'm tired of being patient.

06:58.679 --> 07:02.117
Waiting for this
finicky crystal ball,

07:02.160 --> 07:04.336
which, for all I know,
you tampered with

07:04.380 --> 07:06.904
just so you could get
the Totems for yourself.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.863
I understand why
you might not trust me yet,

07:08.906 --> 07:12.170
but what's more important
right now is that
you trust yourself.

07:12.214 --> 07:13.781
And what makes you think
I don't?

07:13.824 --> 07:17.262
Because I know what you can
achieve when you do.

07:17.306 --> 07:20.352
In the future, you told me
how you conquered
the Fifth Dimension,

07:20.396 --> 07:22.267
but your father fled.

07:22.311 --> 07:25.488
So you set a trap
where everyone said
your father wouldn't be,

07:25.532 --> 07:26.663
and you were right.

07:26.707 --> 07:30.319
Finally, you made
your father pay.

07:30.362 --> 07:32.060
What you've always
been able to count on,

07:32.103 --> 07:35.411
what I'll always
count on... is you.

07:43.593 --> 07:44.725
The Truth Totem.

07:45.552 --> 07:48.206
Don't you dare say,

07:48.250 --> 07:49.251
"I told you so."

07:50.731 --> 07:52.646
[Kelly] All right,
let's get this off.

07:52.689 --> 07:54.735
They were making
posters for the
school's baking competition

07:54.778 --> 07:59.217
and a mean girl made fun of
Esme's chocolate roulade
entry.

07:59.261 --> 08:03.134
Chelsea said it looked
like an ugly log.
I'm gonna lose.

08:03.178 --> 08:07.269
I didn't mean to use my powers,
but then boom,
paint everywhere.

08:08.792 --> 08:11.055
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

08:11.099 --> 08:14.406
I think Chelsea is just jealous
because she's baking
boring old brownies,

08:14.450 --> 08:17.540
and your roulade
is exciting,

08:17.584 --> 08:21.022
-and it's unique,
just like you.
-Thanks.

08:21.065 --> 08:23.285
-No.
-You didn't get the paint
in your ears.

08:23.328 --> 08:25.940
-And I don't know
how you did it.
-It's impressive.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.073
Esme.

08:29.117 --> 08:31.902
What's this back here?
Did someone to draw on you?

08:33.774 --> 08:35.558
Let me see.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.125
Wasn't there at bath time
yesterday.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.782
Is that a tattoo?

08:47.135 --> 08:49.529
You seem distressed, Querl.

08:49.572 --> 08:52.140
Didn't the Legion give you
the information you needed
on Lex Luther?

08:52.183 --> 08:53.141
Yes.

08:53.794 --> 08:54.664
But...

08:55.796 --> 08:57.667
I was also told

08:57.711 --> 09:00.322
that the Big Brain suffered
extensive damage
in the AI plague.

09:00.365 --> 09:03.543
I have orders to return
to the 31st century to help.

09:03.586 --> 09:06.807
You always knew you'd
have to return to your
own time eventually.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.548
There's more.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.595
In order to save
the Big Brain,
I have...

09:14.510 --> 09:16.686
I've been called upon
to merge with it.

09:18.993 --> 09:22.257
If I do so,
I will cease to exist.

09:25.042 --> 09:27.305
-So will you.
-We will exist.

09:29.481 --> 09:32.006
Maybe not as ourselves,

09:33.268 --> 09:34.530
but as a part of
something greater--

09:34.574 --> 09:36.532
I am a part of
something greater!

09:37.489 --> 09:40.188
Here, in this time.

09:40.231 --> 09:42.059
I have a family. I...

09:42.799 --> 09:43.800
I'm in love.

09:45.541 --> 09:46.890
I cannot abandon them.

09:46.934 --> 09:49.458
I will not abandon her!

09:49.501 --> 09:51.416
-If you--
-I know! I know.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.680
I risk jeopardizing
the entire space-time
continuum, but...

09:55.072 --> 09:58.162
[stutters] There must be
another option.

09:58.206 --> 10:00.991
I'm running calculations
on alternate outcomes
as we speak,

10:01.035 --> 10:02.210
and just...

10:06.170 --> 10:07.171
They're not viable.

10:09.173 --> 10:11.654
I have to remain here
long enough

10:11.698 --> 10:14.091
to ensure that Lex and Nyxly
are vanquished,

10:14.135 --> 10:16.180
to at least know
my friends are safe.

10:16.224 --> 10:18.705
Truly am sorry. Querl.

10:18.748 --> 10:21.229
It is unfortunate
that you are burdened...

10:22.230 --> 10:23.535
with feeling so much.

10:24.754 --> 10:25.625
[shudders softly]

10:37.114 --> 10:39.900
Why would someone collect
all these trophies

10:39.943 --> 10:43.077
just to store them
where no one can see them?

10:43.120 --> 10:45.209
It's not about flaunting
what you've got.

10:45.253 --> 10:47.951
It's about having it
and knowing no one else does.

10:49.692 --> 10:50.867
The Truth Totem.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.348
Of course.

10:53.391 --> 10:54.610
The camera never lies.

10:55.959 --> 10:56.873
Cgyrzyx!

10:58.745 --> 11:01.704
[man] To see things
as they truly are,

11:01.748 --> 11:05.273
you must reveal
the truth within yourself.

11:05.316 --> 11:07.884
The truth within.

11:07.928 --> 11:12.062
I want justice against
all those who wronged me.

11:12.106 --> 11:14.151
I want power,
because I want to
be free.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.850
I never again
want to be at
the mercy of others.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.332
Not good enough, eh?

11:21.376 --> 11:23.073
[scoffs] Fine.

11:25.119 --> 11:27.774
I'm afraid of the parts
of myself that are like
my father...

11:30.777 --> 11:32.387
And the part of me
that still...

11:34.606 --> 11:35.956
Still wants his approval.

11:40.438 --> 11:44.747
So... until I say something
you whispers like,

11:44.791 --> 11:47.663
you're going to
keep me here, alone.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.753
Well, joke's on you,

11:50.797 --> 11:52.581
because I'm used to
being alone.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.801
Always have been,
always will be.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.631
But I don't want to be.

12:04.114 --> 12:05.333
The truth is...

12:09.816 --> 12:12.732
I want to know that those close
to me won't betray me.

12:15.691 --> 12:19.042
I want to have someone
close to me.

12:19.086 --> 12:24.569
[man] Now you may see the truth
of who is worthy of your trust

12:24.613 --> 12:27.790
for you have performed
admirably.

12:33.361 --> 12:36.930
-Kara!
-Hey, bud. Ooh!

12:36.973 --> 12:39.323
Hey, I heard you had some
trouble at school today.

12:39.367 --> 12:40.803
Are you okay?

12:40.847 --> 12:43.066
Um... Her powers got
a little out of hand,

12:43.110 --> 12:45.808
so we're just gonna run
some tests and get to
the bottom of it.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.984
[Supergirl]
I'm sorry, Esme.

12:48.028 --> 12:50.030
My powers got a little
overwhelming at times too,
when I was little,

12:50.073 --> 12:52.946
but it gets better,
I promise.

12:52.989 --> 12:55.513
Hey, let's get you to
the med bay and then
we can come back?

12:55.557 --> 12:56.688
Okay. See you.

12:57.907 --> 13:00.170
Hey. Oh, my gosh.
You know what?

13:00.214 --> 13:03.304
Those glasses that Mom and Dad
gave me when we were little,

13:03.347 --> 13:04.871
they were such
a big help to me.

13:04.914 --> 13:07.569
Maybe something like that
could help Esme.

13:07.612 --> 13:11.138
She had power dampeners
before when she was
at that terrible group home.

13:11.181 --> 13:12.748
I'm not gonna control
her like that.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.271
No, it's not
about control.

13:14.315 --> 13:16.143
It could just
give her some relief.

13:16.186 --> 13:18.972
My glasses cut out
the noise for me.
They let me belong.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.625
They let you hide.

13:20.669 --> 13:23.367
Hide my powers, yeah,
but that was a good thing.

13:23.411 --> 13:26.370
Kara, when you came to Earth,
it was dangerous
to be an alien.

13:26.414 --> 13:27.850
It's not like that anymore.

13:27.894 --> 13:30.374
She doesn't have to
hide to fit in.

13:30.418 --> 13:33.203
And I am certainly not going to
make her suppress who she is.

13:33.247 --> 13:37.164
But the world
is still pretty
dangerous, Alex.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.775
I mean, imagine how many people
I could have accidentally hurt

13:39.819 --> 13:41.995
if I didn't know how to
handle my super strength.

13:42.038 --> 13:45.085
Well, she needs to learn
how to manage her powers,
not bury them.

13:45.128 --> 13:48.653
She will learn
how to manage them,
in time.

13:48.697 --> 13:51.831
I'm just saying this,
because I have
the life experience

13:51.874 --> 13:53.876
to know what
she's going through.

13:53.920 --> 13:57.140
I know what you went through
as well. I mean,
I was there, remember?

13:57.184 --> 13:59.186
Of course.

13:59.229 --> 14:01.623
It's just, you're raising a
child with powers now,

14:01.666 --> 14:04.452
and there is no way for you
to fully grasp what that
feels like.

14:04.495 --> 14:09.065
Okay, as you just said, Kara,
she's my daughter
and I am raising her.

14:09.109 --> 14:12.677
And apparently we need to set
some ground rules here.

14:12.721 --> 14:15.245
Because if I want
parenting advice, I'll ask.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.160
And if I don't...

14:17.204 --> 14:18.814
don't tell me
how to raise my kid.

14:25.081 --> 14:26.953
[Dreamer]
Okay, Dream Totem.

14:26.996 --> 14:28.519
Show me where Nyxly is.

14:46.189 --> 14:47.625
You're going back
to the future?

14:48.583 --> 14:49.976
How'd you know?

14:50.019 --> 14:51.934
I just saw it.
Why didn't you
tell me?

14:51.978 --> 14:53.718
I thought we said
no more secrets.

14:53.762 --> 14:56.634
Legion only
informed me that...

14:56.678 --> 15:00.943
I am to return
when our conflict with
Lex and Nyxly concludes.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.946
-I was gonna
tell you, Nia, I swear.
-Why you?

15:03.990 --> 15:05.905
Why can't
somebody else go?

15:05.948 --> 15:10.126
If I don't go... it will mean
the end of all Coluans.

15:13.347 --> 15:14.957
Well, then let me go with you.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.177
You know that
that's not an option.

15:17.220 --> 15:21.442
-Please.
-You have to exist
in this time.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.272
[stomps foot]

15:25.315 --> 15:26.664
I hate
the space-time continuum.

15:31.191 --> 15:32.801
We just have to
accept that...

15:33.845 --> 15:35.543
my destiny is there...

15:37.545 --> 15:40.330
and yours is here.

15:40.374 --> 15:42.811
I honestly don't know how to
live in a world without you.

15:46.206 --> 15:47.468
Nor do I.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.088
Butterscotch sticky buns?

16:00.829 --> 16:02.918
Your favorite, as I recall.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.354
I don't like sweets.

16:05.225 --> 16:06.835
You will.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.402
Thought you might need
a little pick me up

16:08.445 --> 16:10.447
after your ordeal
passing the Truth gauntlet.

16:10.491 --> 16:11.535
I told you...

16:12.667 --> 16:14.277
it was easy.

16:14.321 --> 16:17.977
And yet, you haven't
seemed like yourself since.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.153
Remember, there's nothing
that I wouldn't do for you.

16:28.030 --> 16:28.944
What are you doing?

16:30.163 --> 16:32.208
Making sure of your intent.

16:33.905 --> 16:37.997
I can't risk giving my heart
to a dishonest fool.

16:38.040 --> 16:41.957
But luckily, I have the powers
of the Truth Totem, so...

16:43.698 --> 16:45.004
Tell me,

16:45.047 --> 16:46.527
your poems,

16:46.570 --> 16:47.789
did you mean
what you wrote?

16:49.573 --> 16:51.662
Every word.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.882
My only desire
is to rule by your side

16:53.925 --> 16:57.364
while destroying everyone
who gets in our way.

16:57.407 --> 17:00.758
And after
we've rebuilt the AllStone,
you're going to betray me.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.717
Betray you?

17:02.760 --> 17:06.503
Betraying you is...
inconceivable.

17:06.547 --> 17:09.724
I've spent my whole life
believing no one
was worthy of me,

17:09.767 --> 17:11.465
until you.

17:11.508 --> 17:13.771
It's why I came back
to find you
at this time.

17:13.815 --> 17:17.471
I want to help you achieve
everything you want
and deserve.

17:19.125 --> 17:22.084
And I know I can
do this for you,
because I have.

17:23.216 --> 17:25.000
It is my only desire.

17:33.443 --> 17:34.705
Did I pass?

17:36.446 --> 17:38.013
You have performed admirably.

17:48.806 --> 17:49.764
[computer chirps]

17:52.027 --> 17:54.638
Andrea, hi.
I'm a little busy
right now.

17:54.682 --> 17:56.901
Do you think I'm a callous,
narcissistic monster?

17:59.687 --> 18:03.604
Does this have anything
to do with CatCo publishing
my brother's journals?

18:03.647 --> 18:06.128
You're one of
my oldest friends.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.435
Tell me the truth.
Did I cross an ethical line?

18:08.478 --> 18:11.438
Stealing my brother's journals
and publishing them under
William's byline

18:11.481 --> 18:13.004
isn't your finest hour.

18:13.048 --> 18:15.790
-So I am monster.
-No, I didn't say that.

18:15.833 --> 18:19.141
Look, I am all for taking
my brother down,

18:19.185 --> 18:20.838
but you have to
be careful

18:20.882 --> 18:23.102
that you don't fall back
into bad behaviors.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.540
We know you can act with
a certain...

18:28.281 --> 18:30.674
single mindedness,

18:30.718 --> 18:32.937
but you can't betray someone
like William just to
promote yourself.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.504
That's not why I did it.

18:34.548 --> 18:35.766
Then why did you do it?

18:39.205 --> 18:41.076
When we feel like
our back is against the wall,

18:41.120 --> 18:45.472
we can go into survival mode
and damn the consequences.

18:45.515 --> 18:48.388
Only you can be the judge of
whether that's who you want
to be.

18:49.867 --> 18:51.347
And if it's not, then...

18:53.654 --> 18:54.655
change it.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.272
I've circled the Earth
five times.

19:03.316 --> 19:04.795
There's no sign
of Naxim's ship.

19:04.839 --> 19:07.189
I've had no luck
with my psychic scans either.

19:07.233 --> 19:10.410
And Lena's program tracking
the Lexosuits has run
into interference.

19:10.453 --> 19:13.195
She's thinking that either Lex
has blocked the signal,

19:13.239 --> 19:15.197
or the ship has left
Earth's atmosphere.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.720
Either way,
she's looking for
a workaround.

19:16.764 --> 19:19.201
All right, well,
I'll head back out.

19:19.245 --> 19:22.509
Or you could just tell me why
you've been avoiding the Tower
since this morning.

19:25.251 --> 19:26.469
Alex is mad at me,

19:27.470 --> 19:29.864
because...

19:29.907 --> 19:34.260
I... Because I suggested
that they try to control
Esme's powers

19:34.303 --> 19:36.436
the way my parents did
when I was growing up.

19:36.479 --> 19:38.612
I remember
how scared I was,

19:38.655 --> 19:41.528
having all of these abilities
and not knowing
how to control them.

19:41.571 --> 19:43.834
And until I did...

19:43.878 --> 19:47.925
I hated school,
I had no friends,
I was miserable.

19:47.969 --> 19:49.536
I don't want that for Esme.

19:49.579 --> 19:52.278
That's because you're
a protector, like me.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.758
-It's who we are.
-I didn't want to overstep.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.066
I just want Esme
to be safe.

19:58.109 --> 20:01.025
You have
good intentions, Kara.

20:01.069 --> 20:03.419
But Alex and Kelly
are Esme's mothers.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.247
How they raise her
is really up to them.

20:05.291 --> 20:08.119
I know you want to share
in your sister's happiness.

20:09.425 --> 20:11.384
It might be worth it

20:11.427 --> 20:13.603
to try and clear the air
before the party tonight.

20:27.356 --> 20:28.575
Hey, there.

20:28.618 --> 20:30.403
Shh.

20:30.446 --> 20:33.710
I'm playing hide and seek
with my mom.
Do you see her?

20:33.754 --> 20:36.583
No. I think it's safe
to come out.

20:40.456 --> 20:42.241
Did you bake something?

20:42.284 --> 20:45.418
I did, some apple tarts
for everyone here at the Tower.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.724
I'm at the Tower.

20:47.768 --> 20:48.769
You are.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.076
Thanks.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.513
Of course.

20:53.556 --> 20:56.080
My school's having
a baking competition.

20:56.124 --> 20:58.735
I'm making chocolate roulade,
just like you.

20:58.779 --> 21:00.824
But Chelsea said
it's stupid.

21:00.868 --> 21:02.913
Well, that's not very nice.

21:02.957 --> 21:07.440
I think anyone who doesn't like
chocolate roulade
is a Dodo bird.

21:07.483 --> 21:11.139
Let me tell you a little secret
that I got from Auntie Bindu
in Cochin.

21:11.182 --> 21:13.010
That's where I'm from
in India.

21:13.054 --> 21:15.839
The trick to making
really special chocolate

21:15.883 --> 21:17.798
is a pinch of cardamom,

21:17.841 --> 21:21.758
a touch of turmeric,
and a sprinkle of cloves.

21:21.802 --> 21:23.325
-It's a secret, okay?
-Yeah.

21:23.369 --> 21:24.413
[whirring]

21:24.457 --> 21:25.458
It's Mom!

21:26.981 --> 21:28.330
[whirring]

21:36.730 --> 21:38.166
[sighs heavily]
Damn.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.519
Still no results from
Esme's blood test?

21:44.694 --> 21:46.261
No.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.132
I'm going to cancel
the party tonight.

21:48.176 --> 21:50.221
Alex, no.

21:50.265 --> 21:52.136
Are you sure you want
to cancel the party?

21:52.180 --> 21:53.312
Yes, I'm sure.

21:56.010 --> 21:58.229
We may not need
Esme's blood test
after all.

21:58.273 --> 22:00.275
I just got off the phone
with her school again.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.191
There's a new alien
in her class,
a Tattamite.

22:03.234 --> 22:04.627
I've read about them.

22:04.671 --> 22:06.063
They have powerful tempers

22:06.107 --> 22:07.761
and can manifest
distinctive skin markings,

22:07.804 --> 22:09.371
which they use as camouflage.

22:09.415 --> 22:11.678
[Alex] Skin markings?

22:11.721 --> 22:14.985
Esme might have mimicked
this student, which caused
the rose tattoo on her neck.

22:15.029 --> 22:18.989
And that would account
for her erratic powers
and her anger.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.730
[sighs in relief]
Thank God.

22:20.774 --> 22:22.471
So this means you guys
don't have to cancel the party,

22:22.515 --> 22:25.082
and Esme doesn't have to miss
the baking competition.

22:25.126 --> 22:27.084
Yeah, but,
I mean, are we going
to get there in time?

22:27.128 --> 22:28.347
If we leave now.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.788
[Lena]
Hey, Kara. We just got
a hit off Naxim's ship.

22:34.831 --> 22:36.877
Good thing your Kryptosuit's
good for outer space.

22:47.235 --> 22:49.498
J'onn, there's no sign
of Lex or Nyxly.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.326
Anything?

22:51.370 --> 22:53.067
Negative.
I'm about to search
the portside of the...

22:53.110 --> 22:54.111
[static crackles]

22:54.155 --> 22:55.504
Wait. J'onn?

22:55.548 --> 22:56.549
J'onn, I can't--

22:58.812 --> 22:59.726
[Supergirl grunts]

23:04.557 --> 23:06.428
My suit feels different.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.387
I thought you might appreciate
a little extra oomph,

23:08.430 --> 23:11.172
so I custom fitted
the Truth Totem
into your chest plate.

23:11.215 --> 23:13.392
You'll find the Hope Totem
in your left arm cannon.

23:13.435 --> 23:16.395
[Supergirl] Lex, we know
about you and Nyxly
in the future.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.135
We're not gonna
let that happen.

23:18.179 --> 23:21.791
It seems that you've forgotten,
I always get what I want.

23:21.835 --> 23:22.879
[Supergirl grunts]

23:24.272 --> 23:25.229
[Nyxly] Ooh!

23:26.753 --> 23:28.581
That looks like it hurts.

23:28.624 --> 23:31.192
[Lex] Just some
31st century nanobots
to soften her up.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.715
[Supergirl grunts in pain]

23:46.337 --> 23:47.295
[Nyxly grunts]

23:54.520 --> 23:55.738
[J'onn J'onzz] Supergirl?

23:55.782 --> 23:57.958
Supergirl,
something's not right.

24:04.747 --> 24:05.922
Why, hello, Martian.

24:05.966 --> 24:06.967
[grunts]

24:09.796 --> 24:11.319
That was easier
than I thought. [chuckles]

24:13.277 --> 24:15.018
Wait. What...
Where'd you go?

24:19.370 --> 24:20.328
Can we talk about this?

24:22.635 --> 24:23.636
[grunts]

24:28.423 --> 24:29.468
[grunts]

24:31.905 --> 24:33.776
Poor, deluded Supergirl.

24:33.820 --> 24:37.345
So naively hopeful,
despite overwhelming odds.

24:39.739 --> 24:40.783
[grunts in pain]

24:43.220 --> 24:45.788
[automated voice] Warning.
Oxygen levels failing.

24:48.530 --> 24:49.531
[gasping for air]

24:49.575 --> 24:51.185
Oxygen levels critical.

24:53.622 --> 24:55.885
Self-destruct sequence
initiated.

25:06.069 --> 25:07.636
Are you okay?
Where's Lex?

25:07.680 --> 25:10.030
He's gone, with Nyxly.

25:10.073 --> 25:11.553
[automated voice]
Self-destructing.

25:11.597 --> 25:13.686
Ten, nine, eight...

25:13.729 --> 25:15.514
We have to go.

25:15.557 --> 25:16.863
The Hope Totem,
I'm not leaving here
without it.

25:16.906 --> 25:19.518
...seven, six,
five, four...

25:19.561 --> 25:20.823
-Supergirl, now!
-...three,

25:21.607 --> 25:23.304
two, one.

25:23.347 --> 25:24.697
[explosion thundering]

25:30.572 --> 25:33.575
What's your takeaway from
today's encounter with
Nyxly and Lex?

25:33.619 --> 25:35.577
I'd say it's a huge win.

25:35.621 --> 25:40.364
They no longer have a ship,
no Lexosuit army and no Totems.

25:40.408 --> 25:44.368
We also have
five Totems secured
at Fortress of Solitude,

25:44.412 --> 25:45.369
but don't print that.

25:46.022 --> 25:47.763
Great job, guys.

25:47.807 --> 25:49.591
Lena just filled us in.

25:49.635 --> 25:52.246
And more importantly, please
give a big round of applause

25:52.289 --> 25:55.162
to the new school
baking champion.

25:55.205 --> 25:56.598
-[Supergirl] Hurray!
-[all clapping]

25:59.862 --> 26:01.951
That's a perfect kickoff
to the big party tonight.

26:01.995 --> 26:05.215
About that, our sitter
just called up sick
with the stomach flu,

26:05.259 --> 26:07.000
so you'll only have Alex.

26:07.043 --> 26:09.002
Don't be ridiculous,
I'll take care of Esme.

26:09.045 --> 26:11.308
She and I have
a baker's bond, right?

26:11.352 --> 26:12.919
William, we wanted you
at the party.

26:12.962 --> 26:14.834
Please, I'm happy to help.

26:14.877 --> 26:16.705
See it as a part
of a wedding gift.

26:16.749 --> 26:20.013
Well, we better all get ready.
We have a lot to celebrate.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.014
[William] Mm-hmm.

26:21.057 --> 26:22.406
[Kelly] All right. Ready?

26:22.450 --> 26:23.277
Hey, Alex, wait.

26:25.758 --> 26:27.194
-Um, I'll catch up.
-Okay.

26:27.237 --> 26:28.238
Come on.

26:31.677 --> 26:34.244
I just want to make sure
we're okay after...

26:35.202 --> 26:36.333
After earlier.

26:37.857 --> 26:40.120
I'm really sorry
I overstepped.

26:40.163 --> 26:42.601
I know you want
what's best for Esme.

26:44.690 --> 26:50.043
And I'm sorry
that I reacted so harshly.

26:50.086 --> 26:52.219
And that it was so hard
for you as a kid.

26:52.262 --> 26:55.352
I wish there was more
that I could have done
to make it easier.

26:55.396 --> 26:57.746
You did so much to help me.
You still do.

26:59.574 --> 27:03.186
Esme is really lucky
to have you.

27:03.230 --> 27:09.149
It's really important to me
that she doesn't feel like
an "other".

27:09.192 --> 27:11.804
I don't know what it's like
to grow up as an alien,

27:11.847 --> 27:15.242
but I do know what it's like
to not be living your truth.

27:17.418 --> 27:19.072
And I don't want
that for her.

27:19.115 --> 27:20.769
You're right.

27:20.813 --> 27:23.337
Esme deserves to be proud
of every part of her identity.

27:25.252 --> 27:26.383
So do you.

27:27.558 --> 27:28.951
Especially the mom part.

27:31.214 --> 27:32.868
Because you're
a seriously good one.

27:36.306 --> 27:38.657
-You're a seriously
good sister.
-[chuckles]

27:53.802 --> 27:54.716
[door opens]

27:55.586 --> 27:56.544
Hey, guys.

27:56.587 --> 27:58.241
I just wanted to thank you

27:58.285 --> 28:02.245
for not leaving me behind
to get blown up with my ship.

28:02.289 --> 28:05.640
You know,
I thought I'd feel sad,
you know, seeing it go,

28:05.684 --> 28:08.817
but I feel kind of free.

28:08.861 --> 28:10.645
Like, for the first time
in my life...

28:12.081 --> 28:13.604
I have options.

28:13.648 --> 28:15.128
[Lex] Here's an option.

28:15.171 --> 28:16.607
Go restock the fridge.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.262
You're not the boss of me.

28:19.306 --> 28:20.742
Actually, he is.

28:21.438 --> 28:22.483
Out.

28:29.969 --> 28:32.711
-If you'd rather be alone,
I can...
-No, don't leave.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.063
I'm actually quite tired...

28:38.412 --> 28:39.543
of being alone.

28:41.850 --> 28:43.896
I will always
be here for you.

28:43.939 --> 28:48.161
The longer you're around,
the more you put yourself
at risk,

28:48.204 --> 28:50.903
and the more you give up
our most powerful weapons,

28:50.946 --> 28:55.255
because you're scared
that I might get hurt.

28:55.298 --> 28:58.519
It's foolish and weak.

28:58.562 --> 29:03.524
And I'm running
out of reasons
not to trust you.

29:03.567 --> 29:06.179
I don't have my Totems.
I don't have my magic.

29:06.222 --> 29:10.226
My only other ally is
a moronic
former zookeeper.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.273
I don't have anything
to offer you.

29:15.405 --> 29:16.711
And yet,
you're still here.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.105
Which proves what
the Truth Totem told me.

29:22.151 --> 29:23.631
You really do care.

29:23.674 --> 29:27.548
I meant every word
I wrote in my journal.

29:27.591 --> 29:31.770
Albeit, my didactic rhyming
scheme lacked a certain
je ne sai quoi.

29:32.727 --> 29:33.772
But...

29:35.382 --> 29:37.950
I love you, Nyxly.

29:39.908 --> 29:42.868
And that is not something
that comes naturally to me.

29:42.911 --> 29:43.825
Nor to me.

29:48.874 --> 29:51.006
I'm beginning to see why
my future self...

29:53.356 --> 29:54.401
fell for you.

29:55.706 --> 29:56.620
Is that so?

29:57.534 --> 29:58.535
Mmm.

29:59.275 --> 30:00.276
Hmm.

30:03.062 --> 30:06.065
I think you may want
to take a look at that.

30:06.979 --> 30:07.806
[Nyxly gasps]

30:10.852 --> 30:11.940
[laughs excitedly]

30:13.115 --> 30:14.769
The Love Totem.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.163
Did you know
that was going to happen?

30:17.206 --> 30:21.080
When I finally started
to fall in love with you?

30:21.123 --> 30:22.995
If you did.

30:23.038 --> 30:27.042
I may be from the future,
but you're never predictable.

-[dance music playing]
-[people chattering]

30:39.315 --> 30:41.448
Okay, okay, okay.

30:41.491 --> 30:44.451
To Kelly and Alex.

30:44.494 --> 30:45.800
-[J'onn] Kelly and Alex!
-Yay!

30:45.844 --> 30:46.845
[all] Cheers.

30:50.761 --> 30:53.242
-You gotta keep up.
-Oh, man.

30:53.286 --> 30:54.722
Vodka.
Yeah, that was a choice.

30:54.765 --> 30:55.854
It's a great choice.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.857
And so is this song.

30:58.900 --> 31:01.381
Dance floor, you and me.
Come on, let's go.

31:01.424 --> 31:02.773
[all clapping]

31:11.391 --> 31:12.871
Look at those guys.

31:15.090 --> 31:16.657
Excuse me,
I need to hydrate.

31:20.704 --> 31:22.097
Okay, well,
I'm going to go dance.

31:22.141 --> 31:23.838
Because what's the point
in saving the world

31:23.882 --> 31:25.753
if you don't get to enjoy it
sometimes?

31:25.796 --> 31:27.755
Especially on a day
as momentous as this.

31:30.018 --> 31:31.106
Hello.

31:31.150 --> 31:32.978
Whoo!

31:33.021 --> 31:35.632
I know I told Alex
to take the night off,
but I can't.

31:35.676 --> 31:37.286
You can.

31:37.330 --> 31:39.158
I mean, the Tower is auto
scanning for Nyxly and Lex,

31:39.201 --> 31:41.160
and I'm keeping a psychic
overview of everything.

31:41.203 --> 31:42.335
Of course, you are.

31:43.553 --> 31:44.511
[J'onn] Go, go.

31:44.554 --> 31:45.729
[chuckling]

31:47.862 --> 31:49.037
[music continues]

32:00.092 --> 32:01.571
I'd ask how
you're holding up.

32:05.314 --> 32:08.013
Never thought I'd say this,
but...

32:08.056 --> 32:11.277
I really could use
my personality inhibitors.

32:11.320 --> 32:14.106
All this happiness is
making me quite sad.

32:16.586 --> 32:19.328
I can't stop thinking that soon
I'll have to leave everyone.

32:22.549 --> 32:23.724
Especially you.

32:25.639 --> 32:26.857
Don't think about that.

32:29.686 --> 32:31.079
Right now,
you're here with me.

32:32.385 --> 32:33.429
See?

32:38.652 --> 32:39.914
Do you feel your hand
in mine?

32:41.133 --> 32:42.525
I do.

32:42.569 --> 32:43.962
And my head
on your shoulder?

32:46.442 --> 32:47.487
Yes.

32:49.445 --> 32:50.446
That's all that matters.

32:54.146 --> 32:57.018
Tonight's not the night
to be Debbie Downer.

32:57.062 --> 32:58.672
We're here to celebrate
Alex and Kelly.

33:01.240 --> 33:02.328
[exhales]

33:04.199 --> 33:05.070
You're right.

33:07.507 --> 33:11.032
I do not intend to be this...
Debbie with a sad surname.

33:15.036 --> 33:17.952
You know, actually,
I am grateful...

33:17.996 --> 33:19.910
to feel so much love
and loss...

33:21.303 --> 33:22.522
because then I know...

33:24.350 --> 33:26.004
it all truly meant something.

33:29.485 --> 33:33.098
And that you'll
always be with me,
Nia Nal...

33:34.664 --> 33:35.839
no matter where I go.

33:40.105 --> 33:41.149
Come.

33:42.672 --> 33:44.283
I'll show you how they
dance in the future.

[William] Ooh!

34:02.170 --> 34:04.520
Now these, my dear Esme,

34:04.564 --> 34:06.870
are what The Great British
Bake Offwould call
"handshake-worthy."

34:07.958 --> 34:09.786
Put her there.

34:09.830 --> 34:11.745
You make
a good assistant baker.

34:11.788 --> 34:13.703
Well, it's a honor
to serve.

34:13.747 --> 34:15.966
What do you say
we do a little bit of cleaning

34:16.010 --> 34:18.099
while we wait for these
to cool down, yeah?

34:18.143 --> 34:19.231
Get your mitties off.

34:24.758 --> 34:26.455
Let me help you with that.
Here you go.

34:26.499 --> 34:27.804
Now you get
your left arm in.

34:31.199 --> 34:32.287
[alarm beeping]

34:34.289 --> 34:36.639
Actually,
I'll clean up later.

34:36.683 --> 34:39.729
How about a little game
of hide and seek?

34:39.773 --> 34:41.340
Let's see if you can find

34:41.383 --> 34:43.037
the best hiding spot you can
in J'onn's office. Okay?

34:43.081 --> 34:45.474
-Challenge accepted.
-Good. Go. Hurry.

35:07.583 --> 35:08.715
Ah.

35:08.758 --> 35:09.933
William Dey.

35:11.152 --> 35:12.240
Sounds like your time is up.

35:19.378 --> 35:20.857
[Lex] William.

35:20.901 --> 35:23.338
It has been ages.

35:23.382 --> 35:26.298
Don't worry.
Your friends won't
interrupt our reunion.

35:26.341 --> 35:29.388
I disabled the security systems
before arriving.

35:29.431 --> 35:33.783
I, uh,
caught your little story
about my journal.

35:35.002 --> 35:36.612
Didn't your mother
teach you

35:36.656 --> 35:38.223
it's not nice to take things
that don't belong to you?

35:38.266 --> 35:41.400
Lex, we have more important
matters to tend to.

35:43.228 --> 35:44.794
Care to help?

35:44.838 --> 35:47.710
We're looking for a girl.
She's Dyralian.

35:47.754 --> 35:50.800
About yea tall.
Cute as a button.

35:50.844 --> 35:52.672
Name's Esme.

35:52.715 --> 35:54.152
How do you
know her name?

35:54.195 --> 35:56.241
Don't you know by now?
I know everything.

35:57.024 --> 35:58.025
Where is she?

35:58.068 --> 35:59.113
Not here.

36:01.768 --> 36:02.856
He lies.

36:04.074 --> 36:05.163
[chuckles]

36:06.599 --> 36:07.513
Never mind.

36:08.601 --> 36:09.558
I'll find her.

36:12.692 --> 36:18.437
So, this is what
Supergirl and her chums
call their lair.

36:19.786 --> 36:21.135
Seems remarkably...

36:23.790 --> 36:24.878
underwhelming.

36:40.850 --> 36:41.895
Esme?

36:43.810 --> 36:45.594
[William]
What do you want
with Esme?

36:45.638 --> 36:47.422
[Lex]
Not your concern.

36:47.466 --> 36:49.337
I assure you,
I have her best
interests at heart.

36:49.381 --> 36:51.557
I find that hard to believe,

36:51.600 --> 36:53.515
coming from a man who once
burned down
part of a children's hospital.

36:53.559 --> 36:56.301
[laughs] Touche.

36:56.344 --> 36:57.911
So if you won't snitch
on Esme's whereabouts,

36:57.954 --> 36:59.739
how about the Totems?

36:59.782 --> 37:02.655
Did your new pals let you in
on their secret hiding place?

37:02.698 --> 37:04.222
You're the genius.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.049
You figure it out.

37:06.093 --> 37:08.356
You really had a lot of guts
publishing my journal.

37:10.706 --> 37:13.100
Care to explain
how you came to possess it?

37:17.060 --> 37:18.061
No?

37:19.193 --> 37:20.238
[revolver safety clicks]

37:23.893 --> 37:26.461
I just thought you would have
known better

37:26.505 --> 37:28.289
than to risk
inflaming my wrath.

37:30.073 --> 37:33.512
That's the thing
you will never
understand, Lex.

37:33.555 --> 37:35.253
There will always be
people like me

37:35.296 --> 37:37.951
and the Super Friends
to stand up to you

37:37.994 --> 37:40.823
and show the world
that for all your
delusions of grandeur...

37:42.956 --> 37:45.393
you're just a sad
shell of a man.

37:47.439 --> 37:48.527
Says the paperboy.

37:51.530 --> 37:52.574
-[door creaks]
-[Nyxly gasps]

37:54.272 --> 37:55.360
There you are.

37:56.926 --> 37:58.188
Do I know you?

37:58.232 --> 37:59.668
I'm a friend of your mum's.

37:59.712 --> 38:01.191
Where's William?

38:01.235 --> 38:02.323
[Nyxly] Oh.

38:02.367 --> 38:04.543
He had to go back to work.

38:04.586 --> 38:06.196
Hmm.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.546
But he asked me
to come take
care of you.

38:09.243 --> 38:12.551
I saw the cookies
that you and William baked.

38:12.594 --> 38:14.335
They look scrumptious.

38:14.379 --> 38:17.991
You and I ought to go have
ourselves a little tea party.

38:18.034 --> 38:20.254
Would you like that, Esme?

38:20.298 --> 38:22.300
We're gonna have
the grandest time.

38:23.518 --> 38:24.563
You and I.

38:28.044 --> 38:29.350
[Nyxly] I've got her.

38:29.394 --> 38:30.612
Ooh.

38:30.656 --> 38:31.961
Looks like we have
what we need.

38:35.008 --> 38:36.096
I'll take my leave.

38:39.534 --> 38:41.928
Just remembered
one last thing I had to do.

38:52.112 --> 38:53.592
[grunting, gasping]

39:01.426 --> 39:02.992
That was for
leaking my journal.

39:05.908 --> 39:07.606
[groans]

39:07.649 --> 39:11.566
If by chance you're still alive
when your friends return,

39:11.610 --> 39:15.701
remind them that I am
always one step ahead.

39:15.744 --> 39:19.792
Your shameful little
back alley meeting
with Otis...

39:21.184 --> 39:22.403
I arranged that.

39:22.447 --> 39:24.274
Oh. And when
my dear sister

39:24.318 --> 39:28.061
used her data interception
program to track my Lexosuits,

39:28.104 --> 39:33.066
she unknowingly activated
a Trojan virus that infected
the computer here.

39:33.109 --> 39:38.071
That caused a delay in a very
important blood test result
being sent out.

39:38.114 --> 39:39.768
[William groans]

39:39.812 --> 39:42.249
See, I had to prevent your
friends from understanding

39:42.292 --> 39:44.730
how important the little girl
was until I got what I wanted.

39:45.644 --> 39:46.775
And, as usual...

39:48.473 --> 39:49.430
I win.

39:59.135 --> 40:01.442
To Andrea Rojas.

40:01.486 --> 40:04.619
Subject,
here's your real story.

40:04.663 --> 40:05.664
Send recording.

40:07.753 --> 40:08.928
[labored breathing]

40:19.025 --> 40:20.374
-[dance music playing]
-[excited chatter]

40:24.030 --> 40:26.467
Wait, wait.
Come here. Ready?

40:26.511 --> 40:27.990
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[cell phone chiming]

40:28.034 --> 40:30.558
Hey, I got Esme's
test results back.

40:30.602 --> 40:34.214
There's
Fifth Dimensional energy
in her blood.

40:34.257 --> 40:36.390
What does that mean?

40:36.434 --> 40:40.307
Well, that tattoo,
it looked familiar.

40:40.350 --> 40:44.572
Like the design on the stone
in the original Love Totem.

40:44.616 --> 40:48.054
Okay, we know the Totems
can be reconstituted, so...

40:48.097 --> 40:51.187
What if Esme
somehow became
the Love Totem?

40:51.231 --> 40:53.059
We need to get back
to the Tower, now.

40:54.669 --> 40:56.192
[computer chimes]

41:03.243 --> 41:04.505
[gunshots on video]

41:08.857 --> 41:10.293
[Lex over video]
That was for
leaking my journal.

41:12.687 --> 41:14.994
-Esme, where are you?
-We'll search the other rooms.

41:15.037 --> 41:16.169
William?

41:19.085 --> 41:21.043
William! William.

41:21.087 --> 41:22.088
No!

41:23.698 --> 41:25.526
J'onn! J'onn!

41:31.271 --> 41:33.578
He's... He's dead.

41:38.147 --> 41:39.279
[Kelly] Esme is gone.

41:40.933 --> 41:41.934
Oh, my God.

41:55.861 --> 41:57.863
[theme music playing]
