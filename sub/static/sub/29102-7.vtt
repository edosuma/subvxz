WEBVTT

01:19.662 --> 01:23.333
The Vietnam War was mostly subsidized
by pesticide manufacturers.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.419
Agent Orange, look it up.

01:26.503 --> 01:27.962
Don't need to. I know you're right.

01:28.463 --> 01:32.092
That's why they call the bug spray "Raid,"
after the Son Tay Raid.

01:32.383 --> 01:34.177
This is so nice!

01:34.761 --> 01:38.014
You know what's great
about being gettin' out of Psych,

01:38.098 --> 01:40.100
besides, you know, gettin' out of Psych?

01:40.892 --> 01:44.729
Is actually having a roommate
that you can, like, really talk to.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.065
My last roommate...

01:47.148 --> 01:50.276
she could barely put two words together,
and when she did,

01:50.360 --> 01:53.863
they were either
"dragon bastard" and "fight fire."

01:53.947 --> 01:55.907
"Dragon bastard, fight fire."

01:55.990 --> 01:58.576
She had some weird movie
goin' on in her head.

02:00.745 --> 02:01.996
I need your help here.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.957
Absolutely. Whatever you need.

02:04.040 --> 02:07.669
I need you to go swipe a tablespoon.

02:07.752 --> 02:11.840
Not a teaspoon, a full-sized tablespoon.
A metal one.

02:11.923 --> 02:14.175
A metal one? That might take a while.

02:15.093 --> 02:18.388
However long it takes.
We're playin' the long game.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.431
Okay.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.697
Fuckin' nutbirds everywhere you look.

02:36.072 --> 02:37.907
Funny you should phrase it that way,

02:37.991 --> 02:40.535
because today I'm working
with a flock of actual birds.

02:42.745 --> 02:47.125
Chickens for the new farm therapy program
that Warden Ward has instituted.

02:47.792 --> 02:51.045
Fuckin' Ward.
Talk about an inmate runnin' the asylum.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.381
Makin' us call these criminals
Ms. So

02:53.464 --> 02:55.508
Like they're friends of my parents
and not some dirty felons.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.386
Yeah, and what if they don't
gender identify as a Ms., right?

02:58.469 --> 02:59.971
That's some insensitivity right there.

03:00.054 --> 03:03.558
Who gives a fuck, okay?
Don't even start with that bullshit.

03:03.641 --> 03:06.978
You're not what you feel like.
You got a vag or you got a dick.

03:07.061 --> 03:09.606
I could feel like I'm a Chinese,
don't mean I am one.

03:10.481 --> 03:13.401
Hmm?

03:13.902 --> 03:16.196
Ward got a cool two mil for closing Psych.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.406
Instead of spreadin' it around
on the people who are actually down here,

03:18.489 --> 03:19.991
in this shit with these wackos,

03:20.074 --> 03:24.245
she's givin' the money to fuckin'
chicken farmers. I identify as pissed off.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.080
Actually, there's a lot of research

03:26.164 --> 03:30.501
that shows the benefits of working
with animals for the neurodiverse.

03:40.136 --> 03:41.179
You wanna request a book?

03:42.222 --> 03:46.935
I actually would like your help
to distribute a self-published work.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.020
Nonfiction, it's a new genre for me,

03:49.103 --> 03:51.940
but I think this is compelling,
nonetheless.

03:52.023 --> 03:54.609
If you're lookin' to enter
the underground market,

03:54.692 --> 03:58.071
most folks want porn stuff,
or one of them Bosch books.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.074
Yo, if you wanted to write
some Harry Bosch fanfic, you'd have a bestseller right there.
You can call it "Hairy Bush."

04:03.826 --> 04:05.620
I'm not looking to appeal to the masses.

04:05.703 --> 04:09.249
I need this to get into the hands
of Tasha Jefferson.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.042
No one else.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.352
Why do you look so down?

04:29.435 --> 04:32.105
You should feel good.
Think about all those words you wrote.

04:32.647 --> 04:36.067
Was it too many words?
I mean, I know I can be long-winded,

04:36.150 --> 04:39.487
and I know that writing
is really rewriting, as Stephen King says.

04:39.570 --> 04:42.949
Maybe I should I get it back,
do another pass before Taystee reads it.

04:43.491 --> 04:46.619
Or maybe I should add some sex stuff
to keep it interesting.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.080
Maybe you just should let go and move on.

04:50.206 --> 04:51.791
I knew this cook once, Shandy.

04:51.874 --> 04:55.378
He was always overthinkin' everything,
worryin'.

04:55.461 --> 04:56.879
In the end, that's what killed him.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.258
-No, his meth lab blew up.

05:01.384 --> 05:05.263
But the point is, you need to have
somethin' else that occupies your time.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.432
You know what? You wanna come
to GED class with me?

05:07.890 --> 05:10.143
Mr. Fantauzzo makes it super fun.

05:10.226 --> 05:13.855
Unfortunately, I have already graduated
from high school.

05:13.938 --> 05:17.483
Oh. Well, then do that chicken class that
Alvarez wanted everyone to sign up for.

05:17.567 --> 05:21.237
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
There is a chicken class? What...

05:22.071 --> 05:24.824
Are they going to teach
to the chickens about chickens,

05:24.907 --> 05:28.328
or teach us how to be chickens?
Why am I even asking? I am so in!

05:28.411 --> 05:29.996
Cluck yeah, you are.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.040
See what I did there?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.667
Can't all be winners.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.257
No, no, don't. She's almost there.

05:52.935 --> 05:54.937
-Motherfucker.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.858
One sec. One sec. One sec.

05:58.941 --> 06:03.154
Pipes, can you come out? We need to talk.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.616
Hey. Hi.

06:07.408 --> 06:10.328
Can you guys hang on a second?
I was just about to hop in the shower.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.580
You already came once. Don't be greedy.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.756
Your new, um, habits
have become kind of disruptive.

06:21.839 --> 06:23.966
The resonant frequencies of your vibrator

06:24.050 --> 06:25.843
are distorting the audio
on the baby monitor.

06:25.927 --> 06:30.515
I'm so sorry.
I was just following Alex's suggestion,

06:30.598 --> 06:33.309
and then, I guess it was working too well.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.436
I thought Alex said
you should fuck other people.

06:35.520 --> 06:40.691
Her point was that I need to release
the pressure that's building up,

06:40.775 --> 06:45.822
so that I don't act out in some other way
and screw up my probation.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.826
This way, I don't involve other people.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.370
Man cannot live on masturbation alone.

06:52.453 --> 06:55.665
And woman's stitches
don't always heal right away, okay?

06:56.791 --> 06:58.042
Was it working for you?

06:59.001 --> 07:02.130
For about 30 seconds afterwards,
I'd feel at peace.

07:03.756 --> 07:04.674
That adds up.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.634
-Compulsively masturbating...
-Come on, now.

07:06.717 --> 07:09.095
-...it speaks to something deeper.
-Oh, God.

07:09.178 --> 07:11.681
You're not solving the problem.
You're just masking it.

07:11.764 --> 07:17.019
When was the last time you had real,
physical intimacy with another person?

07:17.103 --> 07:19.188
It's been a while,
but I don't wanna date anybody else.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.606
No one's talking about dating.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.526
This is strictly
a one-night stand situation.

07:23.609 --> 07:24.902
Right.
I know.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.155
The next time you go
to one of your NA meetings,

07:27.238 --> 07:30.616
just go next door and drop in
on a Sex Addicts meeting.

07:31.325 --> 07:33.119
Meet some freaky deakies.

07:33.494 --> 07:34.954
I don't want a freaky deaky.

07:35.913 --> 07:37.999
At least, I don't think so. I don't know.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.961
I'm worried if I hook up
with anybody else,

07:42.044 --> 07:44.505
I'll spend the entire time
comparing them to Alex.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.425
Okay, then, go the opposite.

07:48.176 --> 07:51.053
Hit up one of those douchey gyms
in the Financial District.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.431
Back in the day
when I wanted some strange,

07:53.514 --> 07:56.184
I would grab a Wall Street dude
coming out of spin class.

07:56.267 --> 08:00.313
I knew exactly what his body looked like,
I knew what his sweat smelled like,

08:00.396 --> 08:03.483
and I knew for sure
there would be no emotional attachment.

08:03.566 --> 08:07.904
I could simply hate-fuck
his capitalist brains right out his prick.

08:08.488 --> 08:12.533
Before Lehman Brothers went down,
Neri went down on Lehman Brothers.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.123
No. You have not earned back
your fridge-lidges.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.250
Room temperature only for you.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.587
Un-fucking-believable!

08:24.670 --> 08:27.548
It's up to 123 likes,

08:27.632 --> 08:32.178
27 hearts and 18 sobbing faces!

08:34.722 --> 08:36.140
Fucking Luschek.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.975
What about fucking Luschek?

08:38.059 --> 08:39.310
Keeps commenting on the post

08:39.393 --> 08:42.480
where she basically calls me
Harvey Weinstein.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.982
She accused you
of sexual harassment, not sodomy.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.317
And she didn't even say it was you.

08:46.400 --> 08:50.154
Then why did O'Neill reach out to me?
And Kirkpatrick?

08:50.238 --> 08:52.156
And you know what really chaps my ass?

08:52.448 --> 08:53.991
She doesn't have her facts straight.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.953
She says the warden fired her.
I wasn't even the warden then. Maybe you should message her
with that clarification.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.416
I know you're being sarcastic,

09:03.751 --> 09:07.421
...but I was thinking that maybe
I should reach out to her.

09:07.505 --> 09:10.258
-No!
-I just wanna clear the air.

09:10.341 --> 09:15.054
This is basically one big misunderstanding
that has now turned into slander.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.976
She says I was obsessed with her.
I was not obsessed with her.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.478
Well, you are now.
Joe, you gotta let this go.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.111
Luschek just commented "believe women."

09:30.194 --> 09:33.155
An-- And he did the fist emoji,
but he changed the skin color to white,

09:33.239 --> 09:34.907
instead of keeping it Simpsons yellow.

09:34.991 --> 09:35.866
Who does that?

09:35.950 --> 09:38.911
That's some
white supremacist shit right there.

09:38.995 --> 09:42.790
Maybe I am not the best person
to be advising you on this,

09:42.873 --> 09:45.751
considering you blackmailed me
into giving you a blowjob.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.336
That was consensual blackmail.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.840
And now, we are living
in non-wedded bliss.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.509
Joe, the best thing you can do

09:53.593 --> 09:57.638
as a straight white man
is shut the fuck up.

09:57.722 --> 09:58.931
But that's crazy.

09:59.015 --> 10:03.311
I get it, men have been abusive assholes
throughout time,

10:03.394 --> 10:05.396
but I am not one of those guys.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.357
I'm just trying to get the facts straight.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.485
The only thing more annoying
than you being a nice guy

10:11.569 --> 10:14.697
is your need for everyone
to think that you're a nice guy.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.949
It's not gonna happen,
but this will blow over,

10:17.033 --> 10:18.743
'cause the world doesn't really care
about anyone,

10:18.826 --> 10:20.369
and it really doesn't care about women.

10:21.078 --> 10:24.957
So, sit tight and let it pass.

10:25.958 --> 10:29.420
-Hurts when I sit too long.
-Then stand and let it pass.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.299
Fucking Luschek.

10:33.382 --> 10:34.550
Do it, ping-pong.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.260
We need to talk.

10:37.595 --> 10:38.721
In private.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.681
Yo.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.475
Leave me be.

10:45.728 --> 10:48.689
The guards did a sweep last night
and they cleared out our safe spot.

10:48.773 --> 10:49.690
What did they get?

10:50.024 --> 10:52.526
Your phone and seven marijuana hand rolls.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.403
Thank goodness we're waiting
on a delivery,

10:54.487 --> 10:56.822
but we need to find a safer spot
for when it comes in.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.741
We can call it "safe spot B."

10:58.824 --> 11:02.828
Yo, this is not good.
I have mad shit in that phone.

11:03.621 --> 11:06.582
Deals, amounts, fucking names.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.210
-I was busy.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.047
I don't even know why
I try to set up security protocols

11:13.130 --> 11:14.632
if you're not going to implement them.

11:14.715 --> 11:17.968
It's gonna be fine.
I'll just talk to Hopper.

11:18.678 --> 11:19.637
Hopper?

11:20.262 --> 11:22.556
Hopper has not been to work
for two days now.

11:23.599 --> 11:24.433
What?

11:25.226 --> 11:26.977
Hopper's helping Mom deal with court shit.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.479
What the fuck, yo?

11:28.562 --> 11:31.232
Is she still trying to sue that nail place
for that foot fungus she got?

11:31.315 --> 11:35.111
No, she lost her shit on some dude's car,
thinking it was my boyfriend's.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.238
<i>I mean, lost her shit.</i>

11:37.988 --> 11:41.117
So, now Hopper's skipping work
to fuckin' clean up her mess?

11:41.200 --> 11:45.037
And now Angel broke up with me,
and I miss him so bad.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.206
He's my life, Daya.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.501
What am I gonna do? Fucking Aleida.

11:50.584 --> 11:52.420
The fuck.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.423
Kitchen volunteers reporting for duty.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.551
That's great. We need all the help.
Thank you.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.304
There's a problem.

12:02.888 --> 12:03.931
Diablo?

12:04.014 --> 12:05.891
No, I still can't find him
in the system.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.810
It's about that free lawyer group
I hooked you up with,

12:07.893 --> 12:09.562
the Freedom for Immigrants guy.

12:09.645 --> 12:11.105
Yeah, he's coming next week.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.898
I'm sorry, baby. No.

12:12.982 --> 12:16.152
These ICE <i>pendejos</i>
are-- are not letting them come no more.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.112
Those micro-dicked pieces of shit.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.448
Yeah, ICE is saying that the organization

12:20.531 --> 12:23.409
is inciting riotous behavior
among the detainees.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.994
That's a damn lie.

12:25.077 --> 12:25.953
Liars!

12:26.036 --> 12:27.538
They're banning them
because they can.

12:27.621 --> 12:30.624
Listen, I made some calls
and I put you on some wait lists,

12:30.708 --> 12:33.919
but it's gonna be a couple of months
before a free lawyer could see you.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.589
There is no way
I can delay my hearing that long.

12:36.672 --> 12:37.757
The only reason
I got back here

12:37.840 --> 12:39.967
was because I copied
what the Salvadoran said to the judge.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.886
Maybe you can ask her
to help you,

12:41.969 --> 12:45.514
and maybe you could call her by
her real name instead of <i>"la salvadoreña."</i>

12:45.598 --> 12:48.142
She's too busy
looking down her nose at me.

12:48.517 --> 12:49.852
She's not gonna
reach out her hand.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.520
Let me see this lady.

12:56.025 --> 12:56.942
There she is.

12:57.860 --> 13:02.031
That's her spot.
Always sitting by herself, of course.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.033
Look at that ICE motherfucker,

13:04.116 --> 13:06.869
struttin' around like king rooster
on shit mountain.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.205
Deporting the best and the most beautiful.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.957
He don't even know
how to put his sunglasses on right.

13:15.878 --> 13:18.756
Go to bed with illegals,
you wake up with fleas.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.675
I mean, she could be a terrorist.

13:21.759 --> 13:25.554
They use lady suicide bombers
all the time.

13:26.263 --> 13:30.351
They hide the explosives
under their burqas. It's diabolical.

13:31.435 --> 13:34.271
I don't feel safe with her in the kitchen,
quite frankly.

13:35.606 --> 13:36.857
Don't you think?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.528
Yes. Yes, of course.

13:40.611 --> 13:45.950
I don't understand why we let
all these Muslims into our country

13:46.033 --> 13:49.787
when we know all they wanna do
is destroy our way of life.

13:54.959 --> 13:58.254
I don't know if this was
a real American television show

13:58.337 --> 14:00.881
or a fever dream I had as a child.

14:00.965 --> 14:04.635
I'm basically a walking Wikipedia
of useless pop culture information,

14:04.718 --> 14:06.011
so I'm happy to fact-check.

14:07.388 --> 14:10.432
Was there a show
with a male modeling agency

14:10.516 --> 14:12.101
that secretly solved crimes?

14:12.184 --> 14:16.397
Holy shit. You're talkin' about <i>Cover Up.</i>
I can't believe you saw that.

14:17.022 --> 14:21.110
I'm telling you, my uncle had
the biggest satellite dish for miles.

14:21.193 --> 14:24.363
I watched everything,
whether I could understand it or not.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.740
I liked having the TV on
while I did my homework.

14:27.074 --> 14:30.452
All this nonsense chattering
made me feel less alone.

14:30.703 --> 14:35.082
Well, if you like nonsense chattering,
I am definitely your girl.

14:35.666 --> 14:38.335
I knew there was a reason
why I liked you so much.

14:39.837 --> 14:43.215
Ah, crazy story about <i>Cover Up.</i>

14:43.299 --> 14:46.093
You know the main dude
who played the international male model

14:46.176 --> 14:48.512
who was actually a secret CIA operative?

14:49.513 --> 14:55.060
Well, he accidentally killed himself
on set with a prop gun.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.481
-No, no, no, no, it was blank.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.234
But he held it up to his head,
messing around, pulled the trigger.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.194
And that close, a blank can kill you.

15:04.820 --> 15:08.532
I'm relieved to know it was a real show
and not a strange dream I had.

15:08.616 --> 15:12.286
And I'm relieved that I didn't have to
hear you tell me about a dream you had.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.204
You don't like to hear about dreams?

15:14.288 --> 15:15.497
I have a strict policy.

15:15.581 --> 15:16.916
I don't wanna hear
about anybody else's dream

15:16.999 --> 15:18.542
unless I'm in it and we're fucking.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.086
In the dream, I mean.

15:29.303 --> 15:32.056
A giant was, uh, chasing me.

15:48.238 --> 15:51.450
Okay, final question in this round
of Biology Feud.

15:51.533 --> 15:55.329
Currently, Team Photosynthesis
is in the lead with 62 peanut M&amp;M's

15:55.412 --> 15:58.207
to Team Krebs Cycle's 58. Very close race.

15:58.290 --> 16:02.336
Remember, this one is for the full-sized
Reese's Peanut Butter Cup

16:02.419 --> 16:05.255
for every person on the team.

16:05.339 --> 16:08.384
Does that mean each person gets two?
'Cause they come two to a pack.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.010
No. Every person gets one cup.

16:10.594 --> 16:13.347
What? I was just asking.
-Be classy, dude.

16:13.931 --> 16:18.102
Okay.
"What are the three states of matter?"

16:18.185 --> 16:19.311
-Buzz.
Buzz.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.772
Very close, but it's Ms. Cabrera
by a parsec.

16:21.855 --> 16:22.940
Um...

16:23.774 --> 16:26.777
Solid, liquid and...

16:30.864 --> 16:32.491
-ice.

16:32.574 --> 16:34.243
That is incorrect.
Ms. Doggett for the steal.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.787
Solid, liquid, gas.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.956
-That's correct! Ding, ding, ding!

16:39.039 --> 16:42.960
Team Photosynthesis,
converting that carbon into a win.

16:43.502 --> 16:46.588
One last thing, everyone. Please review
your social studies worksheets.

16:46.672 --> 16:50.092
This Friday, we're gonna do
our very first practice test.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.553
I know. I know.

16:52.636 --> 16:56.098
But the GED board won't let me administer
the test like a game of <i>Jeopardy!,</i>

16:56.181 --> 16:58.267
so we're gonna stick
with the practice tests for now.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.566
Hey.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.735
I was wonderin', uh...

17:07.818 --> 17:10.654
I thought there was only one test
at the end of this whole class.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.031
Sure, the big one, at the end.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.533
But to prepare for it,
we need to take a lot of little ones.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.911
Okay, well, can I just take the class
and no tests?

17:18.620 --> 17:20.289
Then how would you get your GED?

17:21.582 --> 17:24.168
Well, I'm gonna be here a few more years.

17:24.251 --> 17:26.670
So I was thinkin'
that I could just take the class

17:26.754 --> 17:29.757
a couple of more times, no tests,
just learn,

17:29.840 --> 17:33.010
and then I'll be really prepared,
and I'll take my GED thing then.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.597
Ms. Doggett, all of the exams,
including the final GED exam,

17:36.680 --> 17:38.474
are required to stay in the class.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.684
If you wanna keep coming,
you do have to take them.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.606
Oh. Okay.

17:45.689 --> 17:48.776
It doesn't affect your grade.
It's just a practice test.

17:50.652 --> 17:52.196
See you Friday?

18:00.662 --> 18:02.331
-Daddy!

18:02.414 --> 18:04.958
Jesus. You damn near killed me there.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.961
You just damn near
scared the living craps out of me.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.923
It's been a while.
I thought you was in North Carolina.

18:11.006 --> 18:13.801
Yeah, I was, and then it was Texas.
Now, I'm here.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.805
Thought I'd enter the bass fishing tourney
over the weekend,

18:17.888 --> 18:19.264
over at Weebreck Lake.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.225
Figured you might wanna join me.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.268
Why, 'cause you asked Trey and he said no?

18:24.061 --> 18:26.897
No, I figured
I'd ask my first choice first.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.607
Oh, Donny said no.

18:30.567 --> 18:33.028
Listen, Tiff, you don't wanna go,
you don't have to.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.572
But you used to love fishing with me.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.659
Yeah, when I was, like, eight, maybe.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.871
Then you freakin' hocked the boat,

18:42.955 --> 18:45.999
and you left town and you went off
with that Trina lady.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.710
And the Lord punished me for that,
believe you me.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.214
Come on, what do you say

18:52.297 --> 18:54.174
Me and you split that $400 prize?

18:55.217 --> 18:57.678
I haven't been fishing
in, like, a million years.

18:57.761 --> 19:00.597
Well, I ain't askin' on account
of your expertise, Tiff.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.308
You've always been my lucky charm.

19:05.477 --> 19:06.436
Okay.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.480
Sure, I'm in.

19:08.564 --> 19:11.108
All right! Got us a plan.

19:11.191 --> 19:14.111
-Unless I die of thirst before then.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.031
Well, you look good, Dad.

19:18.115 --> 19:21.160
I mean, shit, last time I saw you,
you was real messed up.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.412
Yeah. I'm clean now.

19:24.454 --> 19:27.332
Six months. Just beer and pot.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.168
What about you?

19:31.211 --> 19:32.546
I dabble.

19:35.299 --> 19:40.179
Well, to fishin' ass and kickin' bass,
or, you know, vice versa.

19:48.729 --> 19:49.897
Hey, Joe.
-Hey, Sam.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.274
Hey. Good to see you.

19:52.357 --> 19:55.319
-Thanks for makin' time for me.
-Always, brother, always.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.362
Hey, Corinna,
I'm gonna take my break now, okay?

19:59.656 --> 20:01.742
Hey, I'm gonna make a smoothie.
You want one?

20:01.825 --> 20:03.410
Oh, no, I'm okay.

20:03.493 --> 20:06.079
Oh, come on. I'm makin' it for myself.
It's no bother.

20:06.413 --> 20:07.539
All right. Sure.

20:08.373 --> 20:13.253
Great. This is my special recipe,
off the menu.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.382
So, what's goin' on?

20:18.383 --> 20:20.302
Your energy is kind of unbalanced.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.428
Yeah.

20:21.970 --> 20:22.930
Um...

20:23.847 --> 20:26.391
-We can talk about it when you're done.
-No, it's cool.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.310
I can hear everything perfectly.
What's up?

20:29.853 --> 20:32.689
-I'm sure you saw the thing on Facebook.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.984
Facebook. The thing Susan Fischer
wrote about me?

20:36.443 --> 20:37.361
Who what, now?

20:37.444 --> 20:40.197
Susan Fischer, the guard from camp.

20:40.614 --> 20:43.700
Oh, yeah. The little cutie.
She reached out to you over Facebook?

20:43.784 --> 20:45.410
-She Me Too'd me.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.922
-It looks good.
-Yeah, it's pretty good.

20:59.549 --> 21:02.761
$8.32. I gotta charge you.
They keep track.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.097
Oh... oh.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.814
Hey, thanks. I'll meet you over there.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.365
Take a look at this.

21:24.783 --> 21:25.742
Oh.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.203
That's rough.

21:29.162 --> 21:32.457
Oh, man. That's really rough.

21:32.874 --> 21:33.917
So, what do I do?

21:34.293 --> 21:37.296
I-- I mean,
I had a little bit of a crush on her,

21:37.671 --> 21:39.965
but I was never inappropriate.
I-- I never made a pass.

21:40.048 --> 21:42.217
Now, she's written this thing that...

21:42.509 --> 21:44.386
It's all part of the whole movement,

21:44.469 --> 21:47.848
which I, of course, absolutely support,
the movement.

21:47.931 --> 21:52.436
Absolutely. Me, too. I mean, me, as well.
You know, I support the movement.

21:52.519 --> 21:53.812
Fig says I should ignore it.

21:54.730 --> 21:57.149
You know, when I interviewed for this job,

21:57.232 --> 21:59.484
they wanted to talk to me
about my strengths,

21:59.568 --> 22:03.530
but I wanted to talk about
my weaknesses as well.

22:03.613 --> 22:04.823
Oh, yeah?

22:04.906 --> 22:06.366
Yeah, I mean, I was a great counselor,

22:06.450 --> 22:09.161
but I lacked
in certain interpersonal skills.

22:09.244 --> 22:12.956
So, I was working on that, so I figured,
well, I'll let them know about that.

22:13.040 --> 22:16.209
Well, it worked. You got the job.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.754
Yeah, I got the job,
but it's more than that.

22:18.837 --> 22:19.963
I got out ahead of it.

22:20.922 --> 22:25.927
Which is why, when team member Rebecca
complained about feeling unsafe,

22:26.803 --> 22:28.722
I got a second chance.

22:28.805 --> 22:30.557
Now, they don't put us
on the same schedules,

22:30.640 --> 22:33.310
and I know there's no more
shoulder squeezes.

22:35.103 --> 22:36.438
You gotta get out ahead of it.

22:38.148 --> 22:40.901
-Apologize to Susan.

22:41.777 --> 22:48.033
Explain your side of it,
but most important, listen to her side.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.285
Hey, Sam.

22:50.660 --> 22:52.412
Gonna need you
to wrap up that break, buddy.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.247
You got it, C-Dawg.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.627
These women, they just wanna be heard.

22:58.710 --> 23:01.546
-Yeah. Coming.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.884
-Okay, I gotta go.
-Sam, thank you. Thank you.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.177
Yeah.
-Yeah.

23:12.057 --> 23:16.853
Yo, Madam Secretary.
You workin' in the warden's office today?

23:16.937 --> 23:18.105
Yeah, later.

23:19.022 --> 23:22.442
All right. I figured out
something you could get for me,

23:22.526 --> 23:25.028
and once you get it, I could get for you
that thing that you want.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.656
-Yeah.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.242
My phone got nabbed
in the sweep last night

23:30.325 --> 23:32.869
and I need to get it back
before they figure out it's mine.

23:33.203 --> 23:36.790
And my dickhead stepfucker
isn't showing up to work to help me out.

23:36.873 --> 23:39.626
Look, I don't know where they keep
stuff they seize,

23:39.709 --> 23:41.086
but I know it's not in her office.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.296
It's not. There's a contraband room.

23:44.506 --> 23:46.675
Hopper told me shit's kept there
a couple of days

23:46.758 --> 23:48.760
until they turn it over to the cops.

23:49.928 --> 23:54.433
Warden's got one of the keys.
All I'm asking you to do is get that key.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.476
And do you know where she keeps it?

23:56.893 --> 24:00.021
Bitch, am I supposed to do
everything for you?

24:00.105 --> 24:02.816
You're her assistant. Assist shit out.

24:03.692 --> 24:06.361
Do you want the drugs or not?

24:15.120 --> 24:18.081
Shit. I lined it up wrong. Hang on.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.374
It's okay.

24:20.667 --> 24:21.668
God damn it.

24:23.086 --> 24:24.296
You doin' all right?

24:24.880 --> 24:28.425
I told Piper she could see other people,
and now it's all I can think about.

24:29.092 --> 24:31.678
-Not exactly.

24:31.761 --> 24:35.724
I know it's the right decision
while I'm in here, but I just...

24:35.807 --> 24:38.435
I can't stop picturing it.
I mean, is she...

24:40.103 --> 24:41.980
kissing someone else right now?

24:42.063 --> 24:44.274
Is she fucking someone right now?

24:45.942 --> 24:48.528
Maybe you could try
to reframe it for yourself.

24:49.196 --> 24:51.531
Instead of getting upset
by thinking about it,

24:51.615 --> 24:54.576
you could let yourself be turned on by it.

24:58.788 --> 25:02.626
I appreciate your helpful interest,
but we don't need to talk about this.

25:03.126 --> 25:05.795
-No, it's okay. I don't mind.
-No, no, I'm good.

25:07.088 --> 25:08.131
I'll see you later.

25:33.573 --> 25:37.244
-Somebody's thirsty.
Me

25:38.119 --> 25:40.330
This is a total body hydrator.

25:40.413 --> 25:43.667
Aloe, coconut water, cukes.

25:43.750 --> 25:48.880
I like your Lulus. Are those vintage,
or is boot

25:48.964 --> 25:50.966
Um, vintage.

25:52.676 --> 25:54.594
-Eighteen dollars.

25:54.678 --> 25:55.845
It's cold pressed.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.848
Oh, no. I forgot my credit card.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.517
Oh, that's cool.
What's your membership number?

26:00.600 --> 26:02.727
Um... Uh, you know,
I'm gonna stick with water.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.964
I know you. You went to Brown, right?

26:32.340 --> 26:33.341
Smith.

26:34.342 --> 26:37.345
Brown was too loosey-goosey
with that whole "no grades" thing.

26:37.929 --> 26:38.805
I get it.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.100
You're a goody two
Like to follow the rules.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.060
Depends whose rules.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.813
Let me guess, lawyer?

26:47.188 --> 26:48.148
I work in accounting.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.358
-Mmm.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.861
You don't really care
where I work, do you?

26:52.944 --> 26:55.488
Because I know
I don't give a fuck what you do.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.203
You feel so good.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.666
-You, too.
Like it when I fuck you like this?

27:06.750 --> 27:09.169
Ac-- Actually, you know,
maybe we should try--

27:09.252 --> 27:10.629
On top.
-Yeah.

27:10.712 --> 27:12.714
Yeah. Oh.

27:12.797 --> 27:13.840
Oh, God.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.845
You really like that
You like riding my--

27:18.928 --> 27:20.722
-Maybe if you don't talk.
Okay.

27:21.348 --> 27:22.223
At all.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.232
-Sorry. I gotta pee.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.484
What?

27:35.028 --> 27:37.072
-No, thank you.

27:37.614 --> 27:39.115
Kidding. You know that, right?

27:40.200 --> 27:41.368
You're hilarious.

28:01.137 --> 28:02.597
Are you using my toothbrush?

28:29.874 --> 28:31.376
Uh, the file cabinet's locked.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.796
Oh. Um... Okay, just a second.

28:40.009 --> 28:42.804
I know Linda's probably seen
that interview by now,

28:43.722 --> 28:46.349
but she hasn't called to yell at me.

28:47.767 --> 28:50.770
And now, Hopper is late.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.148
I know they're meeting.

28:53.690 --> 28:54.983
That's how it's done.

28:55.066 --> 28:59.070
They set up the person who's gonna
take over before they fire you.

28:59.612 --> 29:03.825
Oh, yeah, that reminds me.
Linda's out on vacation until Monday,

29:03.908 --> 29:06.369
and Hopper is out sick with strep throat.

29:06.661 --> 29:08.121
What the hell, Taystee?

29:11.958 --> 29:13.501
Okay, that's it.

29:14.127 --> 29:17.297
We are going to meet some chickens.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.090
Uh, but I got a bunch of work to do.

29:19.174 --> 29:24.429
No, as my assistant,
you need to come out there with me.

29:24.804 --> 29:25.805
But why?

29:26.222 --> 29:29.976
Because chickens, Taystee. Come on.

29:36.524 --> 29:38.651
Morning.

29:42.489 --> 29:43.573
Mr. Alvarez.

29:46.034 --> 29:49.245
Uh, why don't you fill me in
on what you got goin' on here so far?

29:52.332 --> 29:55.251
The warming lights are new.
Good price, right?

29:55.335 --> 29:56.503
Yeah, it's, uh...

29:58.171 --> 30:00.256
Taystee

30:01.382 --> 30:03.134
Did you sign up for this program, too?

30:03.218 --> 30:05.345
You know, it is not us
that are teaching the chickens,

30:05.428 --> 30:07.722
but the chickens might be teaching us.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.099
No, Suzanne, I'm not signing up.

30:10.183 --> 30:11.893
Well, did you get to read my book?

30:13.686 --> 30:15.939
Come on. What'd you think?

30:16.022 --> 30:20.235
An-- And be brutally honest,
but lead with the positive,

30:20.318 --> 30:23.404
because I might shut down
and not be able to process the criticism.

30:23.488 --> 30:26.199
-Yeah, I read it.
-Okay, good.

30:26.282 --> 30:30.537
Keep in mind, this was my first foray
into the nonfiction world, so...

30:31.246 --> 30:34.123
I don't wanna talk about it.

30:34.207 --> 30:38.503
Okay. Okay, but did you read the part
about me and Cindy hiding,

30:38.586 --> 30:41.840
and how we saw the men drag in
Piscadoodoo's body?

30:41.923 --> 30:42.882
Or where you just skimming?

30:42.966 --> 30:48.096
No, I read it. I read every detail of it,
and I wish I hadn't.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.891
But I-- I wanted you to know
what really happened.

30:51.975 --> 30:54.978
Why? Did you think it was
gonna make me feel better

30:55.061 --> 30:57.021
to know that it was all a setup?
Because it didn't.

30:57.105 --> 30:59.899
-No, but I was thinking--
-No, you wasn't thinking!

30:59.983 --> 31:01.985
That's the problem. You wasn't thinkin'.

31:02.068 --> 31:04.946
And if I was thinkin',
I would've known that I never...

31:09.325 --> 31:10.994
I never had a chance.

31:16.624 --> 31:19.878
Can I go back to the office now

31:19.961 --> 31:21.504
Sure, go ahead.

32:02.295 --> 32:05.256
-I was trying to.

32:08.384 --> 32:11.387
I had a lawyer all lined up
and fuckin' ICE won't let him in.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.307
Now, I can't get a free one for months.

32:16.184 --> 32:18.311
-I'm my lawyer.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.688
-No.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.025
But you know stuff, right?

32:24.651 --> 32:27.862
Like how you got an extension
to find effective counsel?

32:27.946 --> 32:29.906
The only effective counsel
I can afford is me.

32:30.615 --> 32:33.117
So, if you don't mind,
I'm trying to be effective here.

32:33.201 --> 32:36.579
-Please let me concentrate.

32:36.663 --> 32:38.957
If you two can't behave
like civilized adults,

32:39.040 --> 32:40.249
you'll lose these privileges.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.919
These computers aren't privileges.

32:43.002 --> 32:45.213
They meet the bare minimum
of our legal rights.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.800
This is my center. These are my rules.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.302
So, why don't you get your ass
off of my chair,

32:51.386 --> 32:54.055
go lay down in my bunk,
and shut the fuck up

32:54.138 --> 32:56.391
so I don't have to hear
your shit in my ears.

32:56.474 --> 33:01.020
I am a human being.
I am trying to use the law library.

33:04.774 --> 33:07.151
Library's closed for repairs.

33:54.782 --> 33:57.035
Dad... Oh, shit. I think I got something.

33:57.118 --> 34:00.413
-I do! I do!
-Fuck yeah! That's what I'm talkin' about.

34:00.496 --> 34:02.081
-My good luck charm.
-Yeah.

34:04.542 --> 34:06.002
-All right.
-Shit.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.005
Another pissant little big mouth bitch.

34:10.423 --> 34:12.925
It feels like
that's all you're catchin' today, Tiff.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.511
I'm sorry, Daddy.

34:15.595 --> 34:17.430
Yeah, sorrys and wishes
don't catch fishes.

34:17.513 --> 34:18.973
Now, take a look at that map

34:19.057 --> 34:22.643
and find out where we should be goin'
instead of this dumbass spot you picked.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.779
It's in English, isn't it?

34:32.862 --> 34:34.614
-Yeah.

34:36.199 --> 34:40.703
Hey! Check out this beauty!
Little Gene here caught this one!

34:40.787 --> 34:42.747
It's nine pounds if it's an ounce!

34:42.830 --> 34:45.917
Well, then it's almost big enough
to fit up your huge asshole!

34:46.459 --> 34:49.003
Nice one, Dad. God damn it, I told you
to pick a prime, deep spot!

34:51.714 --> 34:54.634
Now them cocksuckers got one up on me.
Goddamn, you're dumb.

34:58.012 --> 35:00.348
-We still got time.
-You're done fishing.

35:00.431 --> 35:01.390
No. Dad.

35:03.351 --> 35:05.686
You just sit there,
try not to screw shit up for me anymore.

35:05.770 --> 35:06.896
Okay.

35:47.895 --> 35:52.316
Gloria said we don't need as much.
A lot of people are skipping lunch.

35:52.900 --> 35:56.487
Ah, so, Red's shitty cooking
finally sparked a hunger strike.

35:56.571 --> 35:59.907
No, it's the pork. Muslims can't eat it.

36:00.741 --> 36:04.787
They'll eat the dinners, which is beef,
that the Hindus can't eat.

36:06.789 --> 36:10.918
If Red is such a poor cook,
why does she run the kitchen?

36:11.460 --> 36:15.673
Uh, she isn't always like this.
SHU fucked her up a little bit.

36:16.507 --> 36:17.842
She's coming back, though.

36:19.093 --> 36:23.514
But, hey, never say anything bad
about her cooking to her face, okay?

36:24.182 --> 36:28.352
I would hate to see you deported
in a body bag.

36:28.811 --> 36:30.688
What's a body bag?

36:31.689 --> 36:32.523
Uh...

36:33.357 --> 36:38.779
You know, it's like a bag
that you put a dead body in.

36:39.488 --> 36:42.491
It's kind of self-explanatory
if not particularly poetic.

36:49.790 --> 36:53.586
If there are any other American idioms
I can explain to you,

36:53.669 --> 36:56.005
my mouth is at your service.

37:09.977 --> 37:13.189
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?
If I'm moving too fast.

37:13.272 --> 37:16.442
I'm just trying to navigate
our cultural differences here, okay?

37:16.525 --> 37:18.152
You're in the driver's seat.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.404
You wanna just kiss, we could just kiss.

37:21.322 --> 37:23.658
No. That's not all I want.

37:28.871 --> 37:29.872
Mmm.

37:30.748 --> 37:33.834
It's lovely, but, uh, quid pro quo.

37:38.422 --> 37:42.718
Okay, okay, okay. Wait, wait, wait.
That's very nice, but I'm a giver.

37:45.429 --> 37:46.472
Okay.

37:47.139 --> 37:50.476
You know what they say,
two tops don't make a right.

37:58.651 --> 37:59.652
Okay.

38:00.736 --> 38:02.238
Okay, okay. Uh...

38:03.239 --> 38:05.283
Okay, I'm gonna pass out, so...

38:08.035 --> 38:10.288
Okay, you have to stop. I'm gonna die.

38:13.249 --> 38:14.583
You are not going to die.

38:16.919 --> 38:17.920
You trust me?

38:38.024 --> 38:41.277
Oh, uh, you have to wait
for the orange light to come on.

38:41.694 --> 38:44.030
It's not done brewing yet.
That's gonna take for-fuckin'-ever

38:44.113 --> 38:46.490
'cause there's, like,
100 cups of water in there.

38:46.574 --> 38:49.410
But at least once it's done brewing,
it's gonna taste like shit.

38:51.954 --> 38:53.539
I was in prison for 18 months,

38:53.622 --> 38:55.124
so I could drink a cup of mud

38:55.207 --> 38:56.917
and it would taste better
than what they called coffee.

38:59.003 --> 39:03.174
I, uh... I did 90 days in county.
Third DUI is no joke.

39:03.549 --> 39:04.592
Federal Max.

39:05.259 --> 39:07.595
Turns out drug smuggling
is no joke, either.

39:07.970 --> 39:11.265
Hmm. Damn. Look at you.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.351
Look at me.

39:18.564 --> 39:20.566
Meeting time.

39:29.867 --> 39:32.703
You know, the nice thing
about doing the setup

39:32.787 --> 39:35.331
is that I don't have to stick around
after to do cleanup.

39:35.790 --> 39:36.874
Oh, yeah?

39:37.375 --> 39:40.920
Yeah. After this, I'm totally free.

39:42.088 --> 39:43.130
Me, too.

39:44.006 --> 39:45.508
Maybe we should do something about that.

39:49.428 --> 39:52.848
-Maybe if you did it more like--

39:54.225 --> 39:56.143
Sorry, no. Not like that.

39:56.227 --> 40:00.272
It's just... it's been a while
since I've been with someone.

40:00.856 --> 40:04.026
It's cool.
Sex in sobriety is fucking weird.

40:06.195 --> 40:09.031
-Close your eyes.
-Okay.

40:15.579 --> 40:17.790
Sorry. I can't do this. I can't.

40:19.125 --> 40:20.209
It's not you.

40:21.001 --> 40:23.003
You're, um... You're great.

40:24.463 --> 40:26.090
Uh, yeah.

40:27.174 --> 40:30.261
Yeah, uh, I get it.

40:30.636 --> 40:32.638
First time I fucked sober, um...

40:33.347 --> 40:35.099
it messed me up so bad, I smoked crack.

40:37.184 --> 40:38.686
But I didn't pick up a drink.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.355
Yeah, that's exactly it.

40:44.984 --> 40:46.152
Thank you for understanding.

40:48.404 --> 40:49.905
One day at a time.

40:55.786 --> 40:56.954
I need to talk.

41:06.589 --> 41:10.301
I got it, but I'm not giving it up
until I know that's the right key.

41:10.384 --> 41:12.595
Of course it's the right key.

41:12.678 --> 41:16.515
And I'm not gonna give it to you
until you give me the drugs.

41:16.599 --> 41:20.311
Think about it, Taystee.
If I give you the drugs now,

41:20.394 --> 41:22.813
what am I supposed to do
if I find out you ripped me off,

41:23.439 --> 41:25.774
or even made an honest mistake
and messed up?

41:26.108 --> 41:27.568
Either way, I got nothin'.

41:28.444 --> 41:30.863
I can't get a refund,
'cause you're already dead.

41:30.946 --> 41:32.698
So, you've got what you want,

41:32.781 --> 41:34.867
and I'm stuck here with a key
that don't work?

41:36.535 --> 41:38.287
I'm just being logical here.

41:45.044 --> 41:48.672
Hey, D, you better give me what I need.

42:02.811 --> 42:04.647
-Mr. Caputo.
-Please, Joe.

42:05.314 --> 42:07.191
Mr. Caputo, what are you doing here?

42:07.816 --> 42:10.319
-You know, I don't care.
-Wait!

42:11.820 --> 42:15.324
Please, give me a minute.
I'm here to apologize.

42:16.116 --> 42:17.076
Okay?

42:18.160 --> 42:22.957
I am sorry if I ever did anything
to make you feel unsafe,

42:23.040 --> 42:26.627
or uncomfortable, or objectified.

42:27.044 --> 42:30.756
It's not if you did that.
You did do that, all of that.

42:31.131 --> 42:32.174
Right.

42:32.591 --> 42:35.594
If that's how you feel,
then I am really sorry.

42:35.678 --> 42:39.473
Stop saying "if." I'm telling you,
that's how you made me feel.

42:39.557 --> 42:40.808
Okay.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.395
I was a jerk. I was.

42:44.937 --> 42:48.983
I had a little crush on you
and I sincerely thought you felt the same.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.652
But I realize that I was still your boss,

42:51.735 --> 42:55.197
and that made me inviting you
to see my band intimidating.

42:55.281 --> 42:58.284
And for that, I am...
I'm really sorry.

42:58.784 --> 43:01.287
You didn't just invite me
to see your band.

43:01.370 --> 43:04.456
You changed my work schedule
so I had the night off.

43:05.124 --> 43:08.669
Also, your band was called Side Titties.
How was that supposed to make me feel?

43:08.752 --> 43:09.670
It's called Side Boob.

43:10.254 --> 43:13.090
Not that that's much better,
but it was a different time--

43:13.173 --> 43:15.801
I turned down your advances
and you fired me for it.

43:16.176 --> 43:18.012
Oh, that had nothing to do with it.

43:19.221 --> 43:23.183
-You-- You were a terrible CO.
Really?

43:23.267 --> 43:25.311
Did you think that when,
under my own initiative,

43:25.394 --> 43:27.771
I listened to recordings
of inmate phone calls?

43:27.855 --> 43:31.191
And when I translated them from Spanish,
which no other CO could do?

43:31.275 --> 43:32.776
If I was so terrible,

43:32.860 --> 43:35.863
then why didn't you give me a warning
before you fired me out of nowhere?

43:35.946 --> 43:38.157
Oh, my God. Seriously?

43:38.240 --> 43:41.118
I mean, if you think you were a good CO,
you are delusional.

43:41.452 --> 43:44.288
I only gave you so many chances
'cause I liked you. You--

43:44.830 --> 43:46.874
You actually benefited
from my feelings for you.

43:46.957 --> 43:48.709
You are disgusting.

43:48.792 --> 43:51.587
You know what? I take back my apology.
There are real victims out there,

43:51.670 --> 43:55.716
and for you to lump in your story
with theirs, that is disgusting.

43:55.799 --> 43:57.760
It's bad for the whole movement,
which I support.

43:57.843 --> 44:00.429
And also, I was not the warden then,
I was on...

44:00.512 --> 44:03.515
-Eww. Oh, my God!

44:03.974 --> 44:07.394
I-- I tore a stitch. I... Oh.

44:11.106 --> 44:13.317
Hey, you seen my sunglasses anywhere?

44:13.901 --> 44:16.779
On the back of your head?
I meant, that's where they usually are.

44:17.446 --> 44:18.864
I haven't seen them since lunch.

44:19.239 --> 44:21.825
Well, I'll keep my eyes open, sir.
Maybe one of the inmates has 'em.

44:22.534 --> 44:24.370
I mean, uh, deportees.

44:24.453 --> 44:27.289
I mean, detainees. I'll go look.

44:32.711 --> 44:34.338
Excuse me, <i>señor?</i>

44:34.421 --> 44:38.258
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
for how loud me and my friend was before.

44:38.676 --> 44:41.428
You're in America for now.
You can't act like that.

44:41.512 --> 44:45.849
I know. I'm sorry.
We were just excited to see a computer.

44:45.933 --> 44:47.851
Nobody in our village
had a computer before,

44:47.935 --> 44:50.729
except the mayor,
'cause he was a very important man.

44:50.813 --> 44:53.941
We were excited to use not just one,
but two.

44:54.650 --> 44:58.737
Wow. I'm sorry.
Me and my people, we're loud.

44:59.530 --> 45:02.241
I know it's exciting,
but you gotta keep it in check.

45:03.075 --> 45:06.286
And thank you for making sure
everybody here behave quiet

45:06.370 --> 45:07.663
and for everything in the center.

45:08.372 --> 45:11.291
Yeah, well, I still want you
to have a little fun.

45:11.375 --> 45:13.919
I actually put some of my music
on the computers, just to be nice.

45:14.878 --> 45:17.965
I love music. I can't wait to hear that,

45:18.924 --> 45:21.260
whenever you decide
we can use the computer again.

45:22.094 --> 45:24.722
I was actually headed over there now
to plug them back in.

45:33.230 --> 45:36.608
You should check out Jason Mraz.
But don't play it too loud.

45:37.025 --> 45:38.485
Of course. Thank you.

45:42.740 --> 45:44.992
-That's reserved.
-But I want to hear "The Remedy."

45:57.838 --> 45:59.006
If they are going to
turn on the computer,

45:59.089 --> 46:00.632
it should be used by someone
who actually knows how to use it, right?

46:00.924 --> 46:01.925
Thank you.

46:03.218 --> 46:04.887
How did you get him
to do that?

46:04.970 --> 46:07.514
That's the one good thing
about having gone to prison.

46:07.598 --> 46:10.893
That you learn to deal with a
rainbow of assholes and their power trips.

46:11.477 --> 46:13.687
That asshole likes to feel
like a real American hero.

46:13.771 --> 46:15.439
So you make him
feel like one.

46:16.064 --> 46:19.526
That asshole wants to feel
like he is his mama's favorite boy.

46:19.610 --> 46:22.321
So, you act like a proud mama
every time he does something nice for you.

46:22.404 --> 46:24.948
So, when they treat us like animals,
we need to kiss their ass?

46:27.075 --> 46:28.327
Karla, right?

46:29.036 --> 46:31.288
I tried to stand up
to them once.

46:32.122 --> 46:33.332
It made it worse.

46:33.749 --> 46:36.877
All I got was beaten
and fucked up even more.

46:37.920 --> 46:39.505
If they treat you
like an animal...

46:39.588 --> 46:41.089
then act like
you've been tamed.

46:41.799 --> 46:42.758
Like a dog.

46:42.841 --> 46:44.593
But dogs figured out
how to get humans to feed them and pick up their shit.

46:47.179 --> 46:51.391
Look, in the wild, I'm a fucking wolf.
But in these cages...

46:51.475 --> 46:53.352
I can't bite the hand
that feeds me.

46:56.230 --> 46:59.066
Thank you for getting him
to plug in the computers.

47:00.192 --> 47:01.318
Of course.

47:06.031 --> 47:09.076
Hey, we're on the same team.

47:10.994 --> 47:12.037
They are the enemy.

47:23.799 --> 47:25.467
You can't just sit there and watch me.

47:27.135 --> 47:29.346
It's called LexisNexis.

47:30.138 --> 47:33.392
It's like Google, if all you're looking at
is old legal cases.

47:35.185 --> 47:36.687
How did you learn all this shit?

47:37.479 --> 47:41.024
After my husband died,
I did office work for a law firm.

47:42.067 --> 47:44.444
But then they got shut down
for scamming insurance companies.

47:45.237 --> 47:46.405
Shit.

47:46.947 --> 47:49.533
Sounds like you dealt with a rainbow
of assholes, too.

47:59.459 --> 48:01.378
What I'm doing
is looking up examples

48:01.461 --> 48:04.298
of overturned deportation cases, okay?

48:04.381 --> 48:05.507
I click here.

48:06.425 --> 48:07.759
-Uh-huh.

48:08.427 --> 48:12.097
Well, I must say everyone did very well
on this practice exam.

48:12.180 --> 48:15.434
Ms. Kerson. Ms. Munoz, very nice.

48:15.893 --> 48:18.437
I'm gonna send this
to my grandma.

48:18.520 --> 48:20.230
Yo, she's gonna shit herself.

48:20.314 --> 48:21.607
Now, of course,
this is just the first one,

48:21.690 --> 48:24.860
so it's only going to help you
if you review what you did wrong.

48:24.943 --> 48:28.280
I want you to partner up outside of class.
Ms. Doggett.

48:29.615 --> 48:30.949
And Ms. Cabrera.

48:31.575 --> 48:34.036
Oh, hell yeah! 69!

48:34.786 --> 48:37.122
Sixty-nine is barely a passing score,
Ms. Cabrera.

48:37.205 --> 48:38.874
Yeah, but a 69 is hilarious.

48:38.957 --> 48:41.126
Okay! Thank you all so much.
That's all for today.

48:41.209 --> 48:43.795
Ms. Doggett, can I actually have you
stick around for a moment?

48:49.426 --> 48:52.304
I, uh, wanted to talk to you
about your exam.

48:52.387 --> 48:54.765
Why? I wasn't cheating. We were sharing.

48:54.848 --> 48:58.226
Okay. Well, when you copied
Ms. Cabrera's answers,

48:58.936 --> 49:00.395
you made some spelling errors.

49:00.687 --> 49:02.773
Even the answers that she got right,
you got wrong

49:02.856 --> 49:04.858
because you flipped around some letters.

49:04.942 --> 49:09.404
Uh, look at this map. Where she wrote
"Kansas," you wrote "Sankas."

49:09.488 --> 49:11.990
Or where she wrote "Texas,"
you wrote "taxes,"

49:12.074 --> 49:15.994
which is a word, but is not the name
of a state in the South.

49:17.037 --> 49:20.457
Whatever. I don't care, 'cause I quit.

49:21.500 --> 49:23.752
I told you I didn't want
to take stupid tests

49:23.835 --> 49:27.506
and now you're trying to tell me
I'm so stupid I can't even cheat right?

49:27.589 --> 49:29.049
I don't need to put up with this shit.

49:29.132 --> 49:31.969
Nope, nope. Uh, Ms. Doggett,
this is actually good news.

49:32.594 --> 49:36.306
Can I ask you a question?
Do you avoid looking at maps?

49:36.390 --> 49:39.309
No. I don't need 'em.
I know where I'm going.

49:39.393 --> 49:43.397
Okay, but when you do look at maps,
do you feel really dizzy?

49:45.315 --> 49:46.441
Yeah, kinda.

49:49.319 --> 49:51.029
I think you have a learning disability.

49:53.532 --> 49:56.284
I am not R-worded.

49:56.368 --> 49:59.329
No, you're not, um,
but I think that you might be dyslexic.

50:00.038 --> 50:02.207
I wanna get some diagnostic tests
to be sure,

50:02.290 --> 50:04.292
but all signs point to yes,
which is great.

50:04.376 --> 50:05.669
No. It's fucking great, yeah.

50:05.752 --> 50:07.587
It is. The diagnosis is great.

50:07.671 --> 50:10.799
Because once we know what the problem is,
then we can help you.

50:12.050 --> 50:14.761
You know who else was dyslexic?
Steve Jobs.

50:15.262 --> 50:19.850
Whoopi Goldberg. Tom Cruise.
Emmy award-winning actor Henry Winkler.

50:20.142 --> 50:23.311
-Yeah.

50:23.395 --> 50:26.732
Lots of successful people do,
but you need tools to work with it.

50:26.815 --> 50:28.608
So, I'm gonna talk to the warden
about getting you a tutor.

50:28.692 --> 50:31.069
And I'll make sure that you get
extra time on the GED exam.

50:31.153 --> 50:34.156
It's a common allowance that they'll make
for people with learning issues.

50:35.657 --> 50:36.742
Okay.

50:40.370 --> 50:42.789
I do like Whoopi Goldberg. She's funny.

50:43.832 --> 50:46.793
<i>Ghost</i> was one of my favorite movies
for a minute.

50:46.877 --> 50:49.755
-I'm a fan of <i>Sister Act</i> myself.
-Oh, yeah! Me, too.

50:51.423 --> 50:53.175
I'll see you next time, Ms. Doggett.

50:53.675 --> 50:54.509
Okay.

51:08.899 --> 51:11.777
Fuck this. I ain't weighing this crap
to know we lost.

51:11.860 --> 51:14.946
We could win the smallest fish contest.
The prize is 40 bucks.

51:15.614 --> 51:20.202
Suck that. I don't need a prize
for being a fucking try-hard loser.

51:21.161 --> 51:23.663
Oh, if it ain't
Tweedledee and Tweedledumbass.

51:24.998 --> 51:26.041
What the fuck?

51:26.666 --> 51:29.836
What kind of moron names their boat
"Ban Mass"?

51:29.920 --> 51:31.797
What kinda anti

51:31.880 --> 51:34.466
-It says "Bass Man."
-Don't even try, son.

51:34.549 --> 51:37.260
You can't teach a man how to fish
or how to read, apparently.

51:37.344 --> 51:40.972
Are you calling me stupid,
you anti

51:42.265 --> 51:45.060
Yeah, that's right. You walk fast
like the little bitches you are!

51:50.774 --> 51:54.236
You don't come to my town
and disrespect me like that,

51:54.319 --> 51:56.113
you little pissant pieces of shit.

51:56.988 --> 51:58.490
You got something to say, too, stupid?

52:38.155 --> 52:39.156
Alex...

52:42.367 --> 52:43.952
this isn't working.

52:46.371 --> 52:47.873
The open thing.

52:48.999 --> 52:53.253
I do-- I-- I do need
some kind of a release, and I tried,

52:53.336 --> 52:56.047
but I don't think that this is the answer.

52:59.384 --> 53:00.969
Please call me.

53:01.803 --> 53:03.305
<i>I need you.</i>

53:07.142 --> 53:08.894
And then, I might have, uh...

53:10.353 --> 53:12.480
-grabbed my balls.
-Oh, Jesus, Joe.

53:12.564 --> 53:15.525
-I tore a stitch!
-I told you not to go over there.

53:15.609 --> 53:17.861
I-- I--
I figured I could make things better,

53:17.944 --> 53:20.947
that I could convince her
to take it down off Facebook.

53:25.911 --> 53:27.454
Oh, God. She named you.

53:37.797 --> 53:43.470
Excuse me, if I found what looks like
a large slick of human blood,

53:43.553 --> 53:46.014
I should report it to you first
before I clean it, yes?

53:46.097 --> 53:49.726
Yes, absolutely report it first.
Don't touch a possible crime scene.

53:50.143 --> 53:53.855
Yes, that is what I thought.
It's in the stairwell, over here.

53:54.481 --> 53:57.651
It's a copious amount.
I think perhaps a head injury?

53:59.486 --> 54:00.320
Whoa.

54:06.117 --> 54:08.703
Yep, definitely smells
like blood.

54:08.787 --> 54:10.455
Do you want me to clean it now?

54:11.081 --> 54:14.834
No. Uh, no, you just go clean
some other things.

54:14.918 --> 54:16.336
I'll-- I'll call this in.

54:24.719 --> 54:25.887
Did you get your phone?

54:25.971 --> 54:28.682
I did. I did.
Still got some charge on it, too.

54:28.765 --> 54:31.935
Plus, got some razors and joints.
He fell for it, right?

54:32.018 --> 54:34.729
Yes, Sherlock Holmes
has a blood trail to follow now.

54:34.813 --> 54:37.399
Thank God these bitches
got their monthlies synced up.

54:37.482 --> 54:40.402
Easy for you to say
when you're not the blood gatherer.

55:00.547 --> 55:04.050
Oh, man! There really
is a huge mess in here.

55:04.134 --> 55:05.343
Just like we thought.

55:05.427 --> 55:07.095
It's a good thing we're here
to clean it up.

55:07.595 --> 55:09.889
-Very convincing.
-Get in there.

55:25.989 --> 55:27.741
Red

55:31.077 --> 55:32.370
Forgive me.

55:34.205 --> 55:35.582
Please.

55:35.665 --> 55:37.709
It's okay.

55:46.760 --> 55:49.888
-Hey.

55:53.016 --> 55:57.020
There's important information in here
about what happened to Piscatella.

55:57.103 --> 56:00.023
And also some weird-ass drawings.

56:04.319 --> 56:05.236
Hey!

56:06.946 --> 56:07.989
Sit.

56:12.577 --> 56:15.705
Of course it matters. What's your problem?

56:17.248 --> 56:22.337
Taystee, there could be something in here
that overturns your entire case!

56:22.420 --> 56:25.048
Wh-- Why are you dismissing it
like it's nothing?

56:25.131 --> 56:26.674
'Cause it is nothing.

56:27.050 --> 56:28.134
You think she made it up?

56:28.927 --> 56:31.846
I think it don't matter either way.

56:33.056 --> 56:35.934
If this is true,
you need to get this to your lawyer.

56:42.357 --> 56:45.193
Yell at me! Be real with me!

56:46.403 --> 56:49.406
-I feel like I'm talking to a ghost.
-I ain't got nothing to say.

56:50.156 --> 56:54.369
Too busy feeling sorry for yourself
to do something about your situation?

56:54.452 --> 56:56.413
Every fucking day since I got this job,

56:56.496 --> 56:59.457
before I got this job,
I've been fighting for you!

57:00.417 --> 57:03.628
So, could you just please pretend to care?
For my sake?

57:03.711 --> 57:06.423
Why should I do shit for your sake

57:06.506 --> 57:09.884
You got this fancy-ass job
and I gotta die in here.

57:09.968 --> 57:11.928
I don't tell you how to live your life.

57:12.011 --> 57:13.513
You just can't give up.
You cannot give up--

57:13.596 --> 57:18.643
You don't get to tell me
how I feel or how I should feel!

57:18.726 --> 57:21.688
You think the judge is gonna give a shit
about the truth now?

57:21.771 --> 57:23.731
Because they damn sure didn't before!

57:23.815 --> 57:24.983
You were there!

57:26.401 --> 57:27.944
Fine. I don't know shit.

57:28.570 --> 57:30.238
But you don't know shit, either.

57:30.780 --> 57:33.783
Until you got this, you didn't even know
what happened that night.

57:33.867 --> 57:35.785
You didn't know there were witnesses.

57:38.830 --> 57:40.957
You can't just give up hope.

57:41.040 --> 57:44.794
Because then...
then you're already dead, Taystee.

57:48.923 --> 57:50.091
Please.

57:51.384 --> 57:52.427
This is me. I know you.

58:00.018 --> 58:01.227
I can't hope.

58:04.147 --> 58:09.027
I... I don't have
no more fight left in me.

58:10.862 --> 58:12.739
I'm exhausted.

58:14.324 --> 58:16.034
Exhausted. I can't.

58:17.285 --> 58:20.622
Y-- You don't know what's gonna happen.

58:21.789 --> 58:24.959
You gotta keep fighting,
so you can find out.

58:25.043 --> 58:28.463
You gotta keep showing up.
You gotta keep trying.
