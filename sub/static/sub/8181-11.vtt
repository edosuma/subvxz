JUST MARRY HIM?

01:17.042 --> 01:18.243
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

01:18.311 --> 01:19.644
I GOT NO PROBLEM.

01:19.711 --> 01:20.778
I'M SAYING WE SHOULD
WRITE OUR OWN SONG

01:20.846 --> 01:22.747
AND CASH IN
ON THIS CHRISTMAS THING.

01:22.815 --> 01:23.915
YOU'RE SERIOUS?

01:23.983 --> 01:26.251
WHY NOT? I'LL HANDLE
THE LYRICS,

01:26.319 --> 01:28.520
AND YOU SEEM LIKE THE
TYPE THAT CAN WRITE MUSIC.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.971
<i>WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?</i>

01:30.039 --> 01:31.255
I THINK YOU KNOW

01:45.020 --> 01:47.222
BUT THE LORD HAS BLESSED
ME WITH CONGREGANTS

01:47.289 --> 01:50.458
WHO ARE KIND AND GENEROUS
ENOUGH TO DONATE THEIR TIME.

01:53.745 --> 01:55.597
OF COURSE, WITH
EVERYTHING BEIN' SO BUSY,

01:55.665 --> 01:57.666
WE COULD ALWAYS USE
A LITTLE MORE HELP.

01:57.733 --> 01:58.900
SO IF YOU GUYS...

01:58.968 --> 02:00.885
OH, SHHHHH.

SCENE DOWN AT THE CHURCH.

02:33.135 --> 02:35.203
APPARENTLY LAST YEAR THE

03:09.988 --> 03:11.739
<i>YOU DID JUST SPEAK TO

03:11.807 --> 03:13.858

10:48.797 --> 10:49.530
UH... THE BIBLE.

10:51.850 --> 10:53.818
LOOK, DOUG,
JUST RELAX. OK?

10:53.885 --> 10:55.285
I'M SURE I'M
NOT THE ONLY ONE

10:55.353 --> 10:57.521
WHO'S BRINGING
A BOUGHT CAKE. OK?

10:57.589 --> 10:58.723
WELL, I KNOW
LARRY'S WIFE ISN'T.

10:58.791 --> 10:59.791
SHE'S MAKIN'
A VOLCANO CAKE.

10:59.858 --> 11:00.792
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT IS?

11:00.859 --> 11:02.293
IT ERUPTS
CARAMEL LAVA

11:02.360 --> 11:05.129
AND THEN DROWNS A GINGERBREAD VILLAGE.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.384
ANY CHANCE YOU'RE
GONNA BE IN THAT VILLAGE?

11:12.387 --> 11:13.654
NICE JOKE.
THAT'S REAL FUNNY.

11:13.722 --> 11:14.989
YOU KNOW WHAT'S REAL
FUNNY, THOUGH? THAT FACT

11:15.056 --> 11:16.724
THAT I ACTUALLY THOUGHT YOU
WERE GONNA MAKE THIS CAKE.

11:16.792 --> 11:18.959
<i>WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT
MEANS YOU'RE NOT WIFE-ISH!</i>

11:19.027 --> 11:21.212
I'M NOT WHITEFISH?

11:21.280 --> 11:23.981
WIFE... ISH!
WIFELY. WIFE-LIKE.

11:24.049 --> 11:25.850
YOU-YOU NEVER
BRING ME MY SLIPPERS

11:25.918 --> 11:28.052
OR TELL ME I'M CLEVER
OR KNIT ME SOMETHIN'!

11:28.120 --> 11:30.855
OH, WELL, I'M SORRY I DON'T
WAIT ON YOU HAND AND FOOT, DOUG.

11:30.923 --> 11:33.390
<i>THAT'S BECAUSE
I WORK FOR A LIVING!</i>

11:33.458 --> 11:34.825
Y
- WELL, SO DOES THE WOMAN IN THE COMMERCIAL,

11:34.893 --> 11:37.995
<i>AND SHE MANAGES TO GET
EVERYTHING DONE WITH ACID REFLUX!</i>

11:41.066 --> 11:42.567
<i>SO, WHY DON'T YOU
MARRY HER,</i>

11:42.634 --> 11:44.835
<i>AND I'LL MARRY THE GUY IN THE
PEPSI COMMERCIAL THAT I LIKE.</i>

11:44.903 --> 11:47.237
OH, 'CAUSE HE'D NEVER BE WITH
YOU, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:47.305 --> 11:48.639
HE'D HAVE TO GET
HIS OWN PEPSI!

11:48.707 --> 11:49.840
WHATEVER.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:49.908 --> 11:51.341
YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE A LUNATIC.

11:51.410 --> 11:53.511
THIS IS THE CAKE THAT I'M
BRING, SO JUST DEAL WITH IT.

11:53.578 --> 11:54.745
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

11:54.813 --> 11:56.013
YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS FINE! STOP! STOP!

11:56.080 --> 11:57.615
LET ME JUST CUT IT UP
FOR YOU! HYAH! HYAH!

11:57.682 --> 11:58.682
STOP IT.

12:01.753 --> 12:03.020
YEAH.
OK.

12:04.355 --> 12:07.174
FANTASTIC. I'LL JUST
BUY ANOTHER ONE.

12:07.242 --> 12:09.026
YOU KNOW, CARRIE...
WHEN I TOLD PEOPLE

12:09.094 --> 12:11.662
YOU WERE BAKIN' A CAKE
FOR THE CHURCH...

12:11.729 --> 12:13.697
I ACTUALLY FELT PROUD.

12:13.765 --> 12:15.866
GUESS I WAS
JUST BEIN' NAIVE.

12:29.264 --> 12:31.131
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

12:31.199 --> 12:33.867
I'M BAKING YOUR FREAKIN'
CAKE, SO GET OUT.

12:35.136 --> 12:37.405
REALLY? WHAT... WHAT KIND?

12:37.472 --> 12:39.556
WELL, IT'S GONNA BE THIS
WHOLE DELICIOUS FUDGE THING

12:39.624 --> 12:43.460
THAT'S GONNA MAKE CATHY'S
VOLCANO LOOK LIKE A PILE OF CRAP.

12:43.528 --> 12:45.880
IS IT IN THE OVEN?
CAN I SEE IT?

12:45.947 --> 12:47.715
ACTUALLY,
I HAVEN'T STARTED YET.

12:48.650 --> 12:50.201
LOOKS LIKE YOU STARTED.

12:50.268 --> 12:52.169
I CAN'T DO IT! OK?

12:52.237 --> 12:53.854
I TRIED! I MEAN,
ALL THESE RECIPES

12:53.922 --> 12:55.923
NEED THINGS THAT I
- THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE,

12:55.990 --> 12:58.926
LIKE A FOOD PROCESSOR
AND BIG SPOONS!

13:00.128 --> 13:01.762
AND HOW DO YOU
FOLD AN EGG?

13:01.830 --> 13:03.397
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!
IT'S WITCHCRAFT!

13:03.464 --> 13:05.249
OK. JUST RELAX. OK?

13:05.317 --> 13:07.051
LOOK, WE'LL FIND YOU SOMETHIN'
HERE THAT WE CAN MAKE.

13:07.119 --> 13:10.154
ALL RIGHT? UM... HEY. HOW
'BOUT THIS? HOW 'BOUT RUM CAKE?

13:10.222 --> 13:13.557
OH, I TRIED THAT. BUT THEN I GOT
NERVOUS, AND I DRANK ALL THE RUM.

13:15.627 --> 13:17.895
YOU'RE RIGHT, HONEY. I'M
NOT WIFE-ISH OR WHITEFISH,

13:17.962 --> 13:19.730
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU CALLED ME.

13:19.797 --> 13:21.732
ALL THOSE THINGS YOU SAID ABOUT ME
- IT'S TRUE.

13:21.799 --> 13:24.068
OH, JUST-HEY, STOP.
STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP!

13:24.136 --> 13:26.803
STOP! OK?! LOOK, YOU
KNOW WHAT? I GOT AN IDEA.

13:26.955 --> 13:28.121
WE'LL-WE'LL
JUST CALL MY MOM.

13:28.189 --> 13:29.874
AW, COME ON! WHAT

AN EASY RECIPE. OK?

13:34.846 --> 13:37.598
OH, FINE.
I'M TOO DRUNK TO FIGHT.

13:39.033 --> 13:39.667
HELLO?

13:39.734 --> 13:40.784
HEY, MA, IT'S ME.

13:40.852 --> 13:43.087
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT'S WRONG?

13:43.154 --> 13:46.423
NOTHING'S WRONG. LOOK, I JUST
NEED YOUR HELP ON SOMETHING.

13:46.491 --> 13:48.625
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
WHAT IS IT, DARLING?

13:48.693 --> 13:51.695
WELL, UH, TOMORROW

13:51.763 --> 13:54.999
AND CARRIE

13:55.850 --> 13:57.635
OH.

13:58.386 --> 13:59.703
ANYWAY, UM,

13:59.771 --> 14:00.438
WE WERE WONDERIN'
IF YOU HAD LIKE, UH,

14:00.505 --> 14:03.290
AN EASY RECIPE TO,
YOU KNOW, GIVE US.

14:03.358 --> 14:06.727
LET ME THINK.
A NICE, EASY CAKE RECIPE.

14:06.795 --> 14:08.929
HEY, HOW 'BOUT THAT, UH,
CHOCOLATE CRUMBLY THING?

14:08.997 --> 14:11.532
NO. SHE
CAN'T DO THAT.

14:11.599 --> 14:14.902
HEY, WELL, AT LEAST I CAN
MATCH MY PANTS AND MY SHIRT-

14:20.174 --> 14:21.308
This may be
our last chance.

14:21.376 --> 14:22.409
Well, just get
the frickin' recipe!

14:22.477 --> 14:24.879
All right. Right. MA,
YOU-YOU GOT ANYTHING?

14:24.946 --> 14:26.046
HOW ABOUT
A LEMON BUNDT CAKE?

14:26.113 --> 14:28.482
VERY EASY.
A MONKEY COULD MAKE IT.

14:30.201 --> 14:31.501
A monkey
could make it.

14:44.632 --> 14:46.333
CARRIE. THE CAKE.
HUH?

14:46.401 --> 14:47.667
IT'S DONE. IT'S DONE.
I'M UP. I'M UP. I'M UP.

14:48.903 --> 14:50.170
LET'S TAKE
A LOOK AT IT.

14:50.238 --> 14:51.171
OK.

14:53.875 --> 14:55.159
I LOVE YOU.

14:58.246 --> 14:59.346
<i>I LOVE YOU.</i>

15:09.758 --> 15:11.091
MAYBE IT'LL LOOK
BETTER IF WE PUT IT

15:11.158 --> 15:13.360
ON THE CAKE PLATE. YEAH,
LET'S DO THAT. LET'S DO THAT.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.357
AM I DREAMING
THAT WE'RE GIANTS?

15:31.096 --> 15:32.029
NOPE.

15:33.598 --> 15:34.531
ARE WE GIANTS?

15:35.934 --> 15:37.868
I TOLD YOU
WE NEEDED MORE BATTER!

15:37.936 --> 15:39.569
WELL, YOU SHOULDA PUT MORE
BAKING POWDER IN THERE!

15:39.637 --> 15:41.038
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH A PINCH IS!

15:41.106 --> 15:42.139
I KNOW WHAT
A PINCH IS!

15:42.207 --> 15:43.056
OK?
AAH! AAH!

15:43.124 --> 15:44.508
OH, YOU WANNA GO?!
NO, COME ON!

15:44.575 --> 15:46.377
STOP! STOP IT!
STOP IT! COME ON!

15:46.444 --> 15:48.912
WE'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT! I'M HUNG-OVER.

15:48.980 --> 15:52.316
AND NOBODY'S GONNA WANT
TO BUY THIS STUPID DOLL CAKE!

15:52.384 --> 15:53.718
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?!

15:53.785 --> 15:57.621
I DON'T KNOW! THIS IS MY
FIRST BAD EXPERIENCE WITH CAKE!

15:57.689 --> 15:59.556
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M
JUST GONNA SEE WHAT PLACE IS OPEN.

15:59.624 --> 16:00.924
WE'RE GONNA BUY ONE. OK?

16:00.992 --> 16:03.227
N- NO! NO! LOOK,
I GOT AN IDEA. OK?

16:03.295 --> 16:05.896
WE'LL BRING THE COVERED
CAKE PLATE TO THE BAKE SALE.

16:05.963 --> 16:07.498
AND I'LL JUST SAY TO
EVERYBODY, "HEY, EVERYBODY,

16:07.566 --> 16:09.216
I'M GONNA BUY MY WIFE'S
CAKE." AND THEN WE'LL LEAVE

16:09.283 --> 16:10.751
WITH THE SAME
COVERED CAKE PLATE,

16:10.819 --> 16:12.753
AND NOBODY HAS TO
KNOW THAT THE CAKE...

16:14.489 --> 16:16.090
NEVER EXISTED.

16:18.459 --> 16:20.394
SO YOU'RE OK
WITH AN INVISIBLE CAKE,

16:20.495 --> 16:22.663
BUT YOU WON'T LET ME
BUY A REAL ONE.

16:22.730 --> 16:24.397
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN
JUDGE ME WHEN YOU SOBER UP.

16:24.465 --> 16:25.833
NOW, GRAB THE LID.

16:27.869 --> 16:30.203
OH, THE LID
IS MADE OF GLASS!

16:30.272 --> 16:32.773
EVERYBODY WILL KNOW
THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE!

16:32.840 --> 16:34.541
COME ON. THAT'S IT. IT'S OVER. NO!

16:34.609 --> 16:35.943
WAIT. I J-
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

16:36.011 --> 16:38.311
JUST GRAB ME SOMETHIN'
CAKE-SHAPED AND A CAN OF FROSTING.

16:38.379 --> 16:39.613
OK.

16:39.681 --> 16:41.382
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY FROSTING.

16:41.449 --> 16:43.050
IN MY NIGHTSTAND! GO!
OK.

16:48.122 --> 16:49.289
OBSERVED!

16:55.680 --> 16:57.047
I THOUGHT THAT WENT OVER RATHER WELL.

16:57.115 --> 16:58.732
ARE YOU KIDDING?!

16:58.799 --> 17:00.200
THE ONLY SONG
THAT BOMBED WORSE

17:00.268 --> 17:02.302
<i>WAS THAT'S
WEDNESDAY TO ME.</i>

17:03.371 --> 17:04.671
WELL, WE GAVE IT
A WHIRL.

17:04.739 --> 17:06.272
<i>COME ON. LET'S SNEAK
IN TO CHICKEN LITTLE.</i>

17:06.340 --> 17:08.142
WHAT? NO. ARTHUR.

17:08.209 --> 17:10.010
I'M NOT GONNA GO SEE
A MOVIE WITH YOU. OK?

17:10.077 --> 17:12.546
I- I'VE SPENT OVER $600
ON THIS CHOIR.

17:12.614 --> 17:14.147
MY CALVES ARE
SMALLER THAN EVER.

17:14.214 --> 17:16.316
THE ONLY THING I FEEL
LIKE DOING RIGHT NOW

17:16.384 --> 17:18.917
IS REACHING DOWN YOUR
THROAT, GRABBING YOUR HEART,

17:18.986 --> 17:22.321
AND CRUSHING IT WITH MY BARE
HANDS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

17:22.390 --> 17:24.424
I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE
WRITTEN THE FIRST LINE

17:24.492 --> 17:26.893
OF A HIT
BREAKUP SONG!

17:26.961 --> 17:28.545
COME HERE, YOU!

17:36.905 --> 17:37.838
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

17:37.906 --> 17:38.839
NICE
TO SEE YOU.

17:38.907 --> 17:40.640
OH.
OH, HEY.

17:40.708 --> 17:41.909
SEASON'S GREETINGS.
SEASON'S GREETINGS.

17:41.976 --> 17:43.276
OH. THANK YOU.
HEY.

17:43.428 --> 17:45.195
MY WIFE CARRIE. HI. LARRY.

17:45.263 --> 17:46.479
HI.
MY WIFE CATHY.

17:46.547 --> 17:48.481
OH. HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:48.549 --> 17:50.183
YEAH. I'VE HEARD
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU

17:50.251 --> 17:52.485
AND YOUR FAMOUS
ERUPTING CAKES.

17:53.788 --> 17:55.272
ACTUALLY, I'M
A LITTLE NERVOUS.

17:55.340 --> 17:57.874
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
BUBBLING BY NOW.

17:57.942 --> 18:00.494
AND IT'S NOT? AFTER ALL THAT PREP WORK?

18:00.562 --> 18:01.695
OK.

18:01.763 --> 18:03.630
I'M JUST SAYING...

18:03.698 --> 18:06.433
WE'LL CATCH YOU GUYS LATER. OK.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.184
OK.
BYE-BYE.

18:07.251 --> 18:08.369
HEY. THERE'S
FATHER MELLEY.

18:08.436 --> 18:09.469
LET'S DO THIS.
OK.

18:11.172 --> 18:13.206
THEN I WENT BLOND IN THE
EIGHTIES. BUT WHO DIDN'T?

18:14.609 --> 18:17.044
ANYWAY, TRY THE PUNCH. IT'S DIVINE.

18:18.112 --> 18:19.379
HELLO, YOU TWO.

18:19.447 --> 18:22.115
CARRIE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

18:22.183 --> 18:24.652
OH, NO PROBLEM.

18:24.719 --> 18:27.387
WOW. LOOK AT ALL
THE GREAT CAKES HERE.

18:27.455 --> 18:29.022
GOSH, I WONDER WHICH
ONE I'M GONNA CHOOSE.

18:29.090 --> 18:31.391
I DON'T KNOW. WELL, I GUESS
IT'S GONNA BE THIS ONE.

18:31.459 --> 18:32.659
GET THE CAR.
OK.

18:32.727 --> 18:33.727
ALL RIGHT.

18:33.795 --> 18:34.895
WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA.

18:34.963 --> 18:36.563
CAN'T LET YOU
DO THAT.

18:36.631 --> 18:37.864
WELL, WHY NOT?

18:37.932 --> 18:39.400
WE DON'T DO THE
TRADITIONAL BAKE SALE HERE.

18:39.467 --> 18:40.734
WE DO SOMETHING
MUCH MORE FUN.

18:40.802 --> 18:42.202
IT'S CALLED
A CAKE WALK.

18:42.270 --> 18:43.904
HUH.

18:43.972 --> 18:45.072
WHAT'S THAT?

18:45.140 --> 18:47.158
WELL, UH, WE PUT THE CAKES IN A CIRCLE,

18:47.225 --> 18:48.825
AND THE MEN
WALK AROUND THEM.

18:48.893 --> 18:50.060
AND WHEN
THE MUSIC STOPS,

18:50.128 --> 18:51.462
IF YOU'RE IN FRONT
OF A CAKE, YOU BUY IT.

18:51.530 --> 18:54.998
IF YOU'RE NOT, YOU KEEP
GOIN'. IT'S A PANIC.

18:57.551 --> 18:58.485
UH-HUH.

18:58.552 --> 19:00.053
SO, DO YOU WANT THE LID ON OR OFF?

19:00.121 --> 19:01.421
ON. ON. THERE'S
SOME STUFF IN THERE

19:01.489 --> 19:02.756
THAT SHOULDN'T BE
EXPOSED TO AIR.

19:04.659 --> 19:05.592
ALL RIGHTY.

19:06.995 --> 19:08.762
OK, EVERYONE!
LET'S GATHER AROUND

19:08.830 --> 19:10.897
FOR THE MAIN EVENT!

19:10.965 --> 19:11.749
GREAT PLAN.

19:11.816 --> 19:13.734
I DIDN'T COUNT
ON A CAKE WALK.

20:00.715 --> 20:01.982
SORRY, MAN.

20:31.413 --> 20:33.247
WHAT HAPPENED?!

20:33.314 --> 20:35.348
I'VE NEVER SEEN
CARAMEL DO THAT.

20:38.019 --> 20:42.022
HEY... THIS IS A CHOCOLATE
FROSTED COUCH PILLOW!

20:46.076 --> 20:47.844
