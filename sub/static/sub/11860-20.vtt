WEBVTT

00:13.542 --> 00:15.750
This seat taken?

00:27.667 --> 00:29.333
Where you headed?

00:29.417 --> 00:30.709
Ithaca.

00:30.792 --> 00:32.750
Got a transfer
in Cortland.

00:32.834 --> 00:36.083
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

00:36.166 --> 00:37.083
It's about an hour wait.

00:39.208 --> 00:41.125
You, um, going
to school
there?

00:41.208 --> 00:42.417
Cornell.

00:46.834 --> 00:48.875
First year?

00:51.667 --> 00:53.625
Uh, your folks
didn't drop you
off?

00:53.709 --> 00:55.542
- Dad's military.
- No kidding.

00:55.625 --> 00:57.000
Colonel.

00:59.917 --> 01:02.792
Are you, uh...
always this talkative?

01:02.875 --> 01:04.000
You?

01:06.250 --> 01:08.917
- 'Here you go.'
- Thank you.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.542
(man on PA)
'This is the last call for
Rochester. Leave bay four.'

01:13.583 --> 01:16.417
- 'Sorry.'
- What a jerk.

01:25.417 --> 01:27.333
Uh, what you reading?

01:27.417 --> 01:29.375
Heller. "Catch-22."

01:29.458 --> 01:32.709
- Is it good?
- I don't know yet.

01:32.792 --> 01:35.500
I like to get to the end
before making up my mind.

01:37.583 --> 01:41.166
Make love,
not war,
man.

01:41.250 --> 01:42.709
Got it.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.500
A lot of that
going around campus.

01:47.667 --> 01:50.333
How's it look?

01:50.417 --> 01:51.417
Groovy.

01:53.125 --> 01:56.166
- I'm, uh, David. David
Quinn.
- Annabelle Bennet.

02:00.834 --> 02:03.166
- Cornell, huh?
- Cornell.

02:03.250 --> 02:04.750
That's..

02:07.625 --> 02:10.375
No, I'm sure
you'll be fine.

02:10.458 --> 02:15.000
I'm an idiot, telling you how
scared I am when you're
going..

02:15.083 --> 02:16.875
I-I hear they have
great beaches over there.

02:16.959 --> 02:18.875
Besides, I'll...only
be gone for a year.

02:18.959 --> 02:20.375
(man on PA)
'Last call for Cornell.'

02:20.458 --> 02:23.083
David...good luck.

02:24.875 --> 02:26.834
Yeah. You too.

02:26.917 --> 02:28.917
Listen, if you need
someone to write..

02:36.291 --> 02:38.000
Come home safe..

02:38.083 --> 02:40.166
...tell me how it ends.

02:42.333 --> 02:43.834
I'll do that.

02:43.917 --> 02:45.834
You'll probably forget me
as soon as you get to
base.

02:45.917 --> 02:48.291
No, no, I'm stubborn like that.

03:59.667 --> 04:01.041
<i>(male #1)</i>
<i>Why did you enter the basement</i>

04:01.125 --> 04:02.625
without
backup,
Agent Yates?

04:02.709 --> 04:03.834
A man was down.

04:03.917 --> 04:06.083
Shepard had already
taken his wife hostage.

04:06.166 --> 04:09.542
Why not wait for
a hostage
negotiator?

04:09.625 --> 04:11.625
Claire Shepard was
in imminent danger.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.375
There was no time to
wait for a negotiator.

04:14.458 --> 04:16.792
The suspect emerged
with a facial contusion.

04:18.041 --> 04:20.458
That part of the negotiation?

04:20.542 --> 04:22.000
He must have fallen.

04:22.083 --> 04:25.875
After Shepard was
detained,
did you or Detective Rush

04:25.959 --> 04:27.709
strike him in any way?

04:27.792 --> 04:29.333
Absolutely not.

04:29.417 --> 04:30.959
The suspect
indicated he was
hit.

04:31.041 --> 04:34.208
Paul Shepard
murdered nine people.

04:34.291 --> 04:37.250
Feel free to add
<i>resume.</i>

04:44.917 --> 04:47.250
Thirty years on the job,
one thing I've learned

04:47.333 --> 04:51.041
every pat on the head
brings a knife in the back.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.125
[chuckles]
Comforting.

04:53.208 --> 04:54.792
Yeah, that's how
the game is played.

04:54.875 --> 04:57.333
Diane. I think you
know what this is.

04:57.417 --> 04:59.500
You get accolades
while I get reprimanded.

04:59.583 --> 05:02.000
SAC wants you to cool your
heels in the applicant squad

05:02.083 --> 05:03.959
until the OPR finishes
the investigation.

05:04.041 --> 05:06.750
No. I'm gonna take
some AL time
instead.

05:06.834 --> 05:09.542
Mom's been admitted to
the hospital back in
Philly.

05:09.625 --> 05:11.208
I'm sorry to hear that.

05:12.208 --> 05:14.417
If there's anything I can do..

05:15.083 --> 05:16.250
Thanks.

05:21.125 --> 05:23.250
You watch yourself, huh?

05:24.792 --> 05:26.041
Detective.

05:26.125 --> 05:28.291
- I'd like to pick your
brain.
- About what?

05:28.375 --> 05:31.000
Tell me, what do you
know about Woodstock?

05:31.083 --> 05:33.542
Great music, tie-dyes,
brown acid and mud.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.166
This some kind of test?

05:35.250 --> 05:36.875
Three people died
during Woodstock.

05:36.959 --> 05:40.542
One OD'ed, another run over by
a tractor, third was a
homicide.

05:40.625 --> 05:42.917
GI shot to death. I'd
like
to get your read on
it.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.917
I jumped through your
hoops, let your team

05:45.000 --> 05:47.250
debrief me.
I got to get back.

05:47.333 --> 05:49.291
Come on, it's Friday.
I'll have you back by
Monday.

05:49.375 --> 05:52.458
We'll get you a car, the US
Marshal will deputize you.

05:52.542 --> 05:55.291
And you get to hang out
with me a little more.

05:55.375 --> 05:56.750
But I don't really like you.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.583
[chuckles]
Seriously.

05:59.667 --> 06:02.583
Look, I want to
see what you
got.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.500
Any new
information or leads?

06:04.583 --> 06:06.083
No.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.625
some
you're looking into this now.

06:08.709 --> 06:10.625
It came down from
the director's
office.

06:10.709 --> 06:13.625
I get results,
gives me a yank at
HQ.

06:13.709 --> 06:15.041
And this involves me how?

06:15.125 --> 06:18.333
- Could mean a job for you.
- Job?

06:18.417 --> 06:20.458
Federal Cold Case Unit.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.333
(Ryan)
Whoa, hold the elevator.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.375
- Morning.
- Hi.

07:03.458 --> 07:05.000
Anybody want this? Kat?

07:05.083 --> 07:07.125
Asked for an Americano
<i>macchiato</i>

07:07.208 --> 07:08.667
with two pumps of vanilla.

07:08.750 --> 07:09.792
I detect some nutmeg.

07:09.875 --> 07:11.583
You lost me
at
<i>"macchiato."</i>

07:17.333 --> 07:20.000
- 'What was that?'
- We work together.

07:20.083 --> 07:22.333
Don't mean I got to discuss
beverage choices with him.

07:22.417 --> 07:24.834
Yeah, but I thought you
two had a thing going.

07:24.917 --> 07:26.500
Had.

07:26.583 --> 07:28.625
He's a decent guy,
good job, chemistry.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.208
I can see why you'd
want to throw that away.

07:30.291 --> 07:32.375
Mm-hmm. He's all yours.

07:35.625 --> 07:38.458
Hey, boss, French
four-letter word

07:38.542 --> 07:39.834
for fencing sword.

07:39.917 --> 07:40.959
<i>Epee.</i>

07:41.041 --> 07:43.125
It's a three-vowel go-to word.

07:43.208 --> 07:45.542
Think I'll stick to the
Word Jumble and Family
Circus.

07:45.625 --> 07:46.792
Restricted duty doesn't mean

07:46.875 --> 07:49.291
you're anchored
to the desk, Nick.

07:49.375 --> 07:50.792
"Chicken Soup
For The Soul," huh?

07:50.875 --> 07:53.792
Yeah, Mike in patrol
said it changed his
life.

08:00.125 --> 08:01.375
Megan.

08:01.458 --> 08:04.166
- Long time, no see.
- Five years, Nicky.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.375
Yeah.

08:06.458 --> 08:09.333
I-I'm so sorry barging
in here like this.

08:09.417 --> 08:10.625
Our house got broken into.

08:10.709 --> 08:12.250
The cops came,
they didn't do anything

08:12.333 --> 08:15.166
and it's just been
a really, really bad week.

08:16.041 --> 08:18.125
Yeah, uh, have a seat.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.417
So, what happened?

08:22.500 --> 08:23.667
Well, we came home from dinner

08:23.750 --> 08:25.500
the guy's in the house.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.959
- Roy chased him away.
- Roy, that's the husband?

08:28.041 --> 08:31.500
- Ten years this July.
- What's missing?

08:31.583 --> 08:33.959
Earrings and a necklace
my mother gave me.

08:34.041 --> 08:35.709
She got married in them.

08:35.792 --> 08:39.250
- I'll see what I can do.
- Really?

08:39.333 --> 08:42.458
I got some downtime
between cases, so..

08:44.834 --> 08:47.000
(Ryan)
'David Quinn, 20 years old.'

08:47.083 --> 08:49.250
Volunteered for his
first tour of duty in '68.

08:49.333 --> 08:51.750
Was a spotter.
Worked with snipers.

08:51.834 --> 08:54.542
Got called back,
orders
to report to Fort Dix

08:54.625 --> 08:56.417
for a second tour in '69.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.041
Shot in the abdomen with a .38.

08:58.125 --> 09:01.834
- ME say when he died?
- Approximately August 17.

09:01.917 --> 09:03.583
Last full day
of the
concert.

09:03.667 --> 09:07.000
Any idea how he
got to the festival?

09:07.083 --> 09:08.250
'Ford Galaxie.'

09:09.458 --> 09:10.750
'Car was never recovered.'

09:11.500 --> 09:12.625
Any leads?

09:12.709 --> 09:14.333
Well, here's where
the bureau comes
in.

09:14.417 --> 09:16.875
'Reuben Harris, founder of PRS'

09:16.959 --> 09:18.959
Progressive
Revolutionary
Society.

09:19.041 --> 09:19.959
Some kind of

09:20.041 --> 09:21.875
anti-war organization?

09:21.959 --> 09:23.959
Credited with bombing
a draft board office.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.375
Witnesses say
that he and
David

09:25.458 --> 09:27.750
had a confrontation
first day of
Woodstock.

09:27.834 --> 09:30.166
Huh, so what's our
beatnik up to now?

09:30.250 --> 09:32.000
Well..

09:32.083 --> 09:33.417
'...author, professor.'

09:33.500 --> 09:36.166
Made a career as a
<i>guru</i>
to the counterculture.

09:36.250 --> 09:37.750
(Lilly)
'What's a straitlaced
soldier'

09:37.834 --> 09:39.500
'doing with half
a million hippies?'

09:40.875 --> 09:43.125
Let me see that crime
scene photo again.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.125
'Zoom into that necklace.'

09:47.250 --> 09:49.500
She a member of PRS too?

09:51.750 --> 09:55.000
One mention of a Daisy
in the group...no last name.

09:55.083 --> 09:57.250
Well, I got an idea
who might know.

10:00.458 --> 10:01.875
Professor.

10:01.959 --> 10:04.667
[chuckles]
G-men get better
looking every year.

10:04.750 --> 10:08.208
This is Detective
Rush.
I'm Agent Cavanaugh.

10:08.291 --> 10:09.333
Been doing some reading.

10:09.417 --> 10:11.834
Well, it's always
nice to meet a fan.

10:11.917 --> 10:13.583
Now, this guy a fan too?

10:13.667 --> 10:16.000
Witnesses say you had
a conflict at
Woodstock.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.667
Woodstock wasn't
about conflict.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.875
It was about melding
hearts and minds.

10:19.959 --> 10:21.834
How about melding your
mind to the question?

10:21.917 --> 10:25.750
I'll tell you the same thing
I told the man back in the
day.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.250
I'm a pacifist.

10:27.333 --> 10:30.041
Pacifist whose
organization
bombed a draft station?

10:30.125 --> 10:34.083
Terrorist Task Force could snap
on some gloves...reinvestigate.

10:34.166 --> 10:37.709
I'm guessing you got a
little
more to lose now, Reuben.

10:37.792 --> 10:39.875
Alright, maybe I had
words with that GI.

10:39.959 --> 10:42.250
It doesn't mean I
laid a hand on him.

10:42.333 --> 10:43.875
This about Daisy?

10:43.959 --> 10:46.083
- 'She your girlfriend?'
- "Girlfriend?"

10:48.208 --> 10:50.500
It was free love, man.

10:50.583 --> 10:53.000
Only GI Joe wasn't hip to that.

10:54.875 --> 10:58.458
One, two, three, four!
We don't want your stinkin'
war!

10:58.542 --> 11:02.291
'One, two, three, four! We
don't want your stinkin'
war!'

11:02.375 --> 11:04.500
'One, two, three, four!'

11:07.625 --> 11:11.333
(crowd)
One, two, three, four!
We don't want your stinkin'
war!

11:11.417 --> 11:13.375
...want your stinkin' war!

11:13.458 --> 11:17.208
One, two, three, four!
We don't want your stinkin'
war!

11:17.291 --> 11:19.875
One, two, three, four..

11:22.000 --> 11:23.333
Annabelle?

11:24.667 --> 11:26.792
Want to know how it ends?

11:28.583 --> 11:30.125
David.

11:30.208 --> 11:32.333
- What are you doing here?
- 'I-I went to your dorm.'

11:32.417 --> 11:35.250
Your-your roommate said I
could find you with this
group.

11:35.333 --> 11:38.291
[chuckles]
You came all this
way to find me?

11:39.333 --> 11:41.792
I told you, I'm stubborn.

11:43.208 --> 11:45.542
I got called
for a second
tour.

11:45.625 --> 11:47.625
When?

11:47.709 --> 11:48.834
Three days.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.083
I hope to
spend
'em with you.

11:52.166 --> 11:53.959
You know this square, Daisy?

11:54.041 --> 11:56.208
He's a friend, Reuben.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.792
This place is
about peace, you dig?

11:59.875 --> 12:01.125
I'm just talking to a girl.

12:01.208 --> 12:02.208
Want to help stop the war

12:02.291 --> 12:03.959
you know where to find us.

12:10.291 --> 12:11.792
Daisy went to
hand out pamphlets.

12:11.875 --> 12:14.458
I lost her sometime
between Richie Havens

12:14.542 --> 12:16.625
Swami

12:16.709 --> 12:17.792
Any idea where she went?

12:17.875 --> 12:19.166
Well, I figured that she split

12:19.250 --> 12:21.291
with, uh, soldier boy.

12:21.375 --> 12:22.917
David called her Annabelle?

12:23.000 --> 12:26.709
Yeah, well, she was trying
to...leave her past behind.

12:26.792 --> 12:28.208
Annabelle have a last name?

12:28.291 --> 12:30.792
You guys got a file
a mile long on me

12:30.875 --> 12:34.583
and you're telling me that
you don't know who she is?

12:34.667 --> 12:38.208
- Humor us.
- Annabelle Bennet.

12:38.291 --> 12:41.500
The honorable
congresswoman from New York.

12:41.583 --> 12:43.417
- "Congresswoman?"
- I didn't know.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.625
And your director just
happens to open the case?

12:45.709 --> 12:49.000
Listen, the director's
motives are above my pay grade.

12:49.083 --> 12:50.500
Feel free to
back out any time.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.625
Oh, I don't
cut and run.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.959
Uh, Detective Vera,
Detective Valens.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.792
Wow. Two of you for a break-in.

13:02.875 --> 13:05.083
Well, it's a slow
day for homicides.

13:05.166 --> 13:06.875
Roy, honey,
Nick's the one
I..

13:06.959 --> 13:08.750
One of your high
school sweethearts?

13:08.834 --> 13:12.000
Which one are you? The, uh,
hockey player or the AV guy?

13:12.083 --> 13:13.750
Uh, hockey. AV guy?

13:13.834 --> 13:18.083
I'd love to stroll
down memory lane, but..

13:18.166 --> 13:20.166
Looks like he
punched it in.

13:20.250 --> 13:21.875
Jewelry the only thing missing?

13:21.959 --> 13:24.000
As far as I can ascertain.

13:24.083 --> 13:25.542
Tell us again what you saw.

13:25.625 --> 13:26.875
Well, we came
home from dinner.

13:26.959 --> 13:28.750
Wednesday's our date night.

13:31.291 --> 13:34.125
Only if you promise.

13:34.208 --> 13:36.333
I promise.

13:38.792 --> 13:41.208
There's somebody
in the house.

13:41.291 --> 13:42.417
Stay here.

13:46.959 --> 13:49.583
Guess I scared him away.

13:49.667 --> 13:52.417
You heard glass breaking
after Roy entered?

13:52.500 --> 13:54.375
- Yes.
- That sound right, Roy?

13:54.458 --> 13:55.917
All happened so fast.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.417
Probably just
a crime of
opportunity.

13:57.500 --> 13:58.959
Easy there, Kojak.

13:59.041 --> 14:00.083
(Nick)
'We'll get some, uh'

14:00.166 --> 14:02.041
crime scene techs down here to..

14:02.125 --> 14:04.375
...dust for prints, take
some pictures of the door.

14:07.208 --> 14:08.500
You can't go in there.

14:08.583 --> 14:10.875
Excuse the intrusion,
Congresswoman.

14:13.041 --> 14:15.792
So the FBI just barges in now?

14:15.875 --> 14:17.250
When you keep us
waiting an hour.

14:17.333 --> 14:18.542
(male #2)
'Should I call security,
ma'am?'

14:18.625 --> 14:20.208
We just need
a moment of your time.

14:20.291 --> 14:21.500
Agent, do I need to get your

14:21.583 --> 14:22.750
assistant director on the line?

14:22.834 --> 14:26.000
Sorry, but it can't wait, Daisy.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.709
I chair the subcommittee
that votes on bureau funding.

14:34.792 --> 14:37.709
You think that you're the first
agents to land on my doorstep?

14:37.792 --> 14:40.709
Congresswoman, I'm
a Philly homicide detective

14:40.792 --> 14:44.500
and I could care less about
your political affiliations.

14:44.583 --> 14:47.208
I'm here to solve
David Quinn's murder.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.583
What happened to him?

14:55.750 --> 14:57.625
That's what we're
here to find out.

14:57.709 --> 15:01.041
David cut through
500,000 people to find you.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.417
Not too many guys do that.

15:06.458 --> 15:08.667
He was stubborn.

15:10.208 --> 15:14.125
And I was foolish enough to
believe in love at first
sight.

15:14.208 --> 15:15.834
No matter how much
we'd changed.

15:23.959 --> 15:27.417
Found your note
at the info booth.

15:28.959 --> 15:30.125
'How'd you like it?'

15:34.000 --> 15:39.375
"Anything worth
living
for...is worth dying
for."

15:39.458 --> 15:43.041
"And anything
worth dying for..

15:43.125 --> 15:46.208
...is certainly
worth living for."

15:46.291 --> 15:49.000
I must have read it 50 times.

15:54.750 --> 15:58.625
I got home, needed
to get my head
straight.

15:58.709 --> 16:00.792
A month
turned into
two.

16:03.166 --> 16:04.417
Can't imagine
what it was like.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.500
I mean, you hear
these stories.

16:06.583 --> 16:08.542
Whatever you've
heard, it's
worse.

16:11.625 --> 16:12.583
What happened to you?

16:15.041 --> 16:17.291
Well, now that
I've found you,
I..

16:17.375 --> 16:20.083
...I'd rather not waste
time talking about it.

16:23.667 --> 16:26.125
Oh, man, I think
that's Joan.

16:28.458 --> 16:30.625
You want her,
you got her. Come
on.

16:38.291 --> 16:39.375
Careful.

16:48.667 --> 16:51.458
The most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

16:53.834 --> 16:55.542
I know what you mean.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.500
We're getting drenched.

17:12.583 --> 17:15.166
Come on, let's
get out of here.

17:38.125 --> 17:41.875
<i>(Annabelle)</i>
<i>We ran until we found</i>
<i>a barn, and slept there.</i>

17:43.417 --> 17:46.333
Never met anyone else like him.

17:46.417 --> 17:48.458
That's the last
time you saw David?

17:48.542 --> 17:51.333
Went to check in with
some friends the next
day.

17:51.417 --> 17:54.291
Um...got back,
and he was gone.

17:54.375 --> 17:55.333
Hmm.

17:55.417 --> 17:57.125
Do you remember
the name of the farm?

17:57.208 --> 17:59.458
It was a dairy farm, I think.

17:59.542 --> 18:02.041
Past a fork in
the road and a
windmill.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.083
I ran into some
kids the next
day

18:05.166 --> 18:07.583
who told me they
tried to shack up
there.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.875
Farmer chased
them off with a
gun.

18:13.917 --> 18:15.542
- 'What's happening?'
- Jimmy Mota.

18:15.625 --> 18:18.125
That piece of garbage
who attacked your mother.

18:18.208 --> 18:20.500
- Yeah? What about him?
- Took a deal.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.667
Three to five,
sent him to Graterford.

18:22.750 --> 18:24.250
You gotta
be kidding
me.

18:24.333 --> 18:27.250
Could be out in 18
months on good behavior.

18:27.333 --> 18:29.000
Thought you should know.

18:29.083 --> 18:30.333
Yeah.

18:31.125 --> 18:32.583
Thanks.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.166
Prints back on
that burglary
job.

18:36.250 --> 18:39.375
'Most belong to the home
owners, except for these.'

18:39.458 --> 18:40.625
(Nick)
'"Shelly Hewit."'

18:40.709 --> 18:42.750
Teaches AP math over
at Jefferson High.

18:42.834 --> 18:44.291
Got an AFIS hit
off her
mandatory

18:44.375 --> 18:46.166
background check
and fingerprints.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.333
And she's got a few
shoplifting charges

18:48.417 --> 18:49.875
<i>resume</i>
a couple of years
back.

18:49.959 --> 18:52.291
Megan works over at Jefferson.
Maybe they're friends.

18:52.375 --> 18:55.000
Must be special friends
'cause the print
concentration

18:55.083 --> 18:57.041
was on the bedposts
and the headboard.

19:00.625 --> 19:01.667
Oh.

19:08.083 --> 19:09.333
Pop quiz, Shelly.

19:09.417 --> 19:11.208
What didn't you disclose..

19:11.291 --> 19:13.333
...on your job application?

19:13.417 --> 19:16.333
Kleptomania was
a by-product of my depression.

19:16.417 --> 19:18.875
My therapist said
it made me feel alive.

19:18.959 --> 19:20.208
It work?

19:21.291 --> 19:22.667
Till I got caught.

19:22.750 --> 19:24.875
Do you know Megan Easton?
Teaches history.

19:24.959 --> 19:27.375
Just "hi" and "bye"
in the break room.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.542
- Ever been to her house?
- No.

19:31.291 --> 19:32.959
Help us out.

19:34.333 --> 19:37.083
- Megan's house was broken
into.
- Jewelry taken.

19:37.166 --> 19:39.583
What does your therapist say
about breaking and entering?

19:39.667 --> 19:40.667
I didn't take that jewelry.

19:40.750 --> 19:43.458
But you were in
her house, right?

19:46.333 --> 19:47.375
Your prints are all over.

19:47.458 --> 19:49.875
Headboard and bedposts,
to be exact.

19:49.959 --> 19:51.583
(Nick)
'See, what I can't
figure out is why someone'

19:51.667 --> 19:53.834
would break into someone's
house, play patty-cake

19:53.917 --> 19:55.375
with the bedposts and then
just steal some jewelry--

19:55.458 --> 19:58.083
Okay. I was in the house.

19:58.166 --> 19:59.458
But not to steal.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.083
What the hell
are you doing
here?

20:05.166 --> 20:06.417
I've been calling..

20:06.500 --> 20:08.333
You said you were
going to leave her.

20:08.417 --> 20:10.917
My-my wife is outside.
Shelly, please.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.625
She's probably calling
the police right now.

20:12.709 --> 20:15.542
I wore something
special for you.

20:15.625 --> 20:18.625
Look, um, we'll-we'll say
there was a break-in,
okay?

20:18.709 --> 20:20.375
The-the guy took
the jewelry,
okay?

20:20.458 --> 20:23.583
And, uh, and, um, and I
chased him away, okay?

20:23.667 --> 20:24.750
Don't you love me?

20:24.834 --> 20:26.625
Of course.
Of course I do,
baby.

20:26.709 --> 20:28.792
Yes. Of course.
Of course, baby.

20:28.875 --> 20:30.834
Look, um, we'll go
away somewhere nice.

20:30.917 --> 20:32.458
- Do you mean it?
- I promise.

20:32.542 --> 20:35.000
- Okay.
- You pack a bikini,
alright?

20:35.083 --> 20:37.125
Now, let's get out of here
before the cops come, okay?

20:37.208 --> 20:39.375
Out the back.
Please, alright?

20:40.625 --> 20:42.959
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

20:45.750 --> 20:47.458
"Bikini."

20:47.542 --> 20:50.750
Took me to Cleveland for
a mortgage broker
conference.

20:50.834 --> 20:51.875
(Kat)
'Let me guess.'

20:52.000 --> 20:54.041
Roy still plans
on leaving his wife.

20:54.125 --> 20:55.500
We're in love.

20:55.583 --> 20:57.709
You keep drinking
that Kool-Aid, honey.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.625
So hard to find
a good guy, you
know.

21:03.792 --> 21:05.875
Do you still
have the jewelry?

21:05.959 --> 21:08.000
Roy wanted me
to pawn it,
but I

21:08.083 --> 21:10.250
I couldn't
do that to
Megan.

21:16.917 --> 21:19.208
(female over PA)
'Radiology tech,
call operations.'

21:19.291 --> 21:21.792
'Radiology tech,
call operations.'

21:21.875 --> 21:24.667
Thought you could
use some company.

21:24.750 --> 21:29.125
Well, I've got a "US News
& World Report" from '07

21:29.208 --> 21:31.625
and a "Highlights" magazine.

21:31.709 --> 21:34.625
- We don't have to talk.
- What else are we going to
do?

21:35.875 --> 21:39.208
I meant...you..

21:39.291 --> 21:41.583
...want to be
alone.
I get that.

21:43.166 --> 21:47.083
- How's your mother?
- Stroke.

21:47.166 --> 21:49.583
They're not sure
if they caught it in time.

21:51.625 --> 21:54.959
[sighs]
They let you
in to see
her?

21:55.041 --> 21:56.375
Mm-hmm.

21:57.959 --> 22:00.041
Didn't know what to say.

22:00.125 --> 22:02.709
I mean, here's this
woman who raised me.

22:02.792 --> 22:05.166
All I can see is this person

22:05.250 --> 22:08.000
I spent my whole life
trying not to be like.

22:09.166 --> 22:12.500
You know, resented her
for being a housewife.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.250
Most of all,
I resented

22:14.333 --> 22:17.000
how proud she
was of her life.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.000
So tell me..

22:22.083 --> 22:23.000
Yeah.

22:23.083 --> 22:25.208
What have I got
to be proud of?

22:38.667 --> 22:41.709
So this is Woodstock.

22:41.792 --> 22:43.834
There's the
fork
in the road.

22:47.208 --> 22:49.792
(Lilly)
Annabelle said
there was a windmill.

22:50.667 --> 22:52.583
Let's check it out.

22:54.500 --> 22:55.792
(Ryan)
Can you believe
that soldier came

22:55.875 --> 22:57.625
all the way out
here to find her?

22:57.709 --> 22:59.917
(Lilly)
I guess he thought
she was the one.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.583
What about you?

23:01.667 --> 23:03.625
What about me?

23:03.709 --> 23:05.291
Well, I just figured you
had a guy back in Philly.

23:10.500 --> 23:13.709
Let me guess...a cop.

23:17.375 --> 23:22.083
And your last girlfriend was
a 24-year-old paralegal,
right?

23:23.208 --> 23:25.792
- Twenty-five.
- Oh.

23:25.875 --> 23:28.125
Grad student, biology.

23:30.041 --> 23:32.333
<i>fiancee.</i>

23:32.417 --> 23:34.125
Huh.

23:34.208 --> 23:37.000
What happened, she remove
you from her profile?

23:41.000 --> 23:44.542
Head-on
collision...
two years ago.

23:45.875 --> 23:48.625
[exhales
heavily]
Sorry.

23:48.709 --> 23:50.834
I certainly know
how to kill a
moment.

23:50.917 --> 23:53.291
No, I, uh,
it's good to know

23:53.375 --> 23:56.041
who I'm lost in
the fields with.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.625
- Ah.
- We're not lost.

23:58.709 --> 24:00.083
Look, there's the barn
right there. Come on.

24:00.166 --> 24:01.417
We're getting soaked.

24:07.291 --> 24:08.291
Wow.

24:13.250 --> 24:14.834
(male #3)
Hold it!

24:21.625 --> 24:22.625
You always point
a gun at everyone

24:22.709 --> 24:24.083
that comes on your property?

24:24.166 --> 24:25.709
I got a right
to bear arms

24:25.792 --> 24:27.625
'protect my livestock.'

24:28.792 --> 24:30.959
You want to tell me
what this is all about?

24:31.041 --> 24:32.041
Woodstock.

24:33.834 --> 24:35.417
Milk trucks couldn't
get through for days

24:35.500 --> 24:38.500
'cause all the love buses
they had blocking the roads.

24:38.583 --> 24:41.250
What about a soldier
named David Quinn..

24:41.333 --> 24:44.125
He might have
stayed in your
barn?

24:44.208 --> 24:47.542
- What happened to this kid?
- He was shot and killed.

24:47.625 --> 24:49.250
- Ever own a .38?
- No, ma'am.

24:49.333 --> 24:51.291
Just what you see there.

24:51.375 --> 24:53.291
Said his name was David.

24:53.375 --> 24:55.709
He was hooked up with
some of them bohemians

24:55.792 --> 24:57.667
but this kid wasn't
like the others.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.583
I trusted you, Daisy.
How could you?

25:02.667 --> 25:04.750
- Reuben, you're upset.
- You knew about Xavier.

25:04.834 --> 25:06.208
You were the only
one I told.

25:06.291 --> 25:08.583
It's time for you
to beat feet, pal.

25:08.667 --> 25:11.166
Baby killer's
a part of it too.

25:11.250 --> 25:12.291
Admit it!

25:13.667 --> 25:15.166
(Annabelle)
Stop it.

25:15.250 --> 25:16.625
Stop it,
David,
please!

25:19.208 --> 25:21.917
- This is who you want?
- Reuben, wait.

25:24.166 --> 25:26.083
Got to talk to him.

25:27.333 --> 25:28.917
Annabelle.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.750
(male #3)
'Made a mess of my barn.'

25:31.959 --> 25:33.458
'You think those
tags are a joke?'

25:34.667 --> 25:36.834
Men die for the
honor
of wearing those.

25:36.917 --> 25:38.917
No, sir.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.458
I earned these
the hard way.

25:40.542 --> 25:43.625
First Infantry.
Big Red One.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.458
Why didn't you say so?

25:46.709 --> 25:49.834
101st
Airborne.
Tiger Force.

25:54.875 --> 25:56.834
He helped out around the farm.

25:56.917 --> 25:58.458
Bucked hay, mended a fence.

25:58.542 --> 25:59.917
Sounds like a good army man.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.667
(Al)
'I wouldn't expect
anything less.'

26:01.750 --> 26:03.959
I was in 'Nam myself.

26:04.041 --> 26:06.542
Picked up a packet
of shrapnel and..

26:07.959 --> 26:10.583
Damn war did
a number on all of us.

26:10.667 --> 26:12.208
David ever
mention
this Xavier?

26:12.291 --> 26:14.625
No, he just took off
to find his girl.

26:20.667 --> 26:23.625
Hey. What, did you get
a break in the case?

26:23.709 --> 26:25.917
Sit down before
I knock you down.

26:38.333 --> 26:41.667
Alright, look, um,
I've made some mistakes.

26:41.750 --> 26:45.458
Save it, and before you try
and throw Shelly under the
bus

26:45.542 --> 26:47.667
I know the whole
break-in
thing was your idea.

26:47.750 --> 26:49.208
No, i-it wasn't my idea.

26:49.291 --> 26:51.041
Look, things just
got out of hand.

26:51.125 --> 26:53.709
What got out of hand was
you banging your
girlfriend

26:53.792 --> 26:56.041
in Megan's house.

26:56.875 --> 26:59.375
[scoffs]
Oh.

26:59.458 --> 27:01.166
Oh, I get it.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.458
What, you still got
a thing for Megan, huh?

27:06.417 --> 27:08.750
Listen to me, scumbag.

27:08.834 --> 27:11.917
You got one shot
to make this
right.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.041
You take that jewelry
and you get it back to
Megan

27:15.125 --> 27:16.917
and you tell her the truth.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.542
You remember what
that is, right?

27:21.792 --> 27:24.375
Now, get out of here
before I lose my
appetite.

27:37.083 --> 27:38.750
Here.

27:38.834 --> 27:39.917
I got it.

27:42.834 --> 27:46.667
You, uh, want to run
it under hot water..

27:46.750 --> 27:48.041
...tap it and twist.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.208
You with the advice.

27:53.625 --> 27:54.959
Hey.

27:56.417 --> 28:00.125
Veronica has been seeing
her dad...every other weekend.

28:00.208 --> 28:06.625
- Not my place.
- Actually, she seems...happy.

28:07.542 --> 28:09.000
That's good.

28:10.667 --> 28:12.250
Here.

28:12.333 --> 28:14.542
Come on, give it up.

28:21.542 --> 28:23.250
I might have underestimated you.

28:23.333 --> 28:25.667
Wouldn't be
the first
time.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.125
It never sat right,
the way we left
things.

28:32.208 --> 28:33.458
Well, you went to New York.

28:33.542 --> 28:34.625
I didn't want to be the gal

28:34.709 --> 28:35.959
who slept around the department.

28:36.041 --> 28:39.041
- Is that how it was?
- Come on, John.

28:39.125 --> 28:40.333
We wound up together

28:40.417 --> 28:42.583
any promotion I got
would have been
suspect.

28:42.667 --> 28:44.125
Never thought of it that way.

28:44.208 --> 28:46.542
Men don't have to.

28:46.625 --> 28:49.125
I wanted to be taken seriously.

28:49.208 --> 28:51.208
Did you find what
you were looking for?

28:51.291 --> 28:53.125
Yeah, I thought I did.

28:53.208 --> 28:56.667
And now they're going
to take that from me.

28:56.750 --> 28:57.709
'Cause of the Shepard case?

28:57.792 --> 28:58.792
I don't retire, they're gonna

28:58.875 --> 29:00.625
just pack me up to Anchorage.

29:07.709 --> 29:09.750
You gonna go
back to New York?

29:11.000 --> 29:12.500
Yeah, don't
know what's gonna

29:12.583 --> 29:14.834
be left for me
here in Philly.

29:22.375 --> 29:25.291
What do you got?

29:25.375 --> 29:27.417
Lenny "Xavier" Franklin

29:27.500 --> 29:29.625
Reuben's second in command
was arrested two days

29:29.709 --> 29:32.458
prior to Woodstock for
attempting to bomb a
courthouse.

29:32.542 --> 29:35.667
- This from the PRS file?
- COINTELPRO.

29:35.750 --> 29:37.500
Back in the day,
we had a rat in every camp.

29:37.583 --> 29:40.709
You're saying someone clued
the FBI in on Lenny's plan?

29:40.792 --> 29:42.792
Bureau safeguards
the informant's identity

29:42.875 --> 29:45.250
by assigning them a series
of classified numbers.

29:45.333 --> 29:47.000
So who has access
to these numbers?

29:47.083 --> 29:50.583
Well, the informant's
handler and supervisor..

29:50.667 --> 29:52.834
...and now us.

29:52.917 --> 29:56.750
Meet R-M number
1-5-7-2-6-8.

29:56.834 --> 29:58.250
Annabelle wasn't
a hippie chick.

29:58.333 --> 30:00.500
She was working
undercover for the bureau.

30:02.291 --> 30:04.375
So she was
informing on
Reuben.

30:04.458 --> 30:05.667
Could be David
got in the middle.

30:05.750 --> 30:06.875
Well, this comes
out, our liberal

30:06.959 --> 30:08.083
congresswoman's image will be

30:08.166 --> 30:09.166
tarnished for good.

30:09.250 --> 30:11.667
Welcome to the FBI.

30:14.291 --> 30:17.208
- Narcotics.
- What?

30:17.291 --> 30:20.083
Uh, the cop,
guy in
Philly..

30:20.166 --> 30:23.875
...he's...undercover somewhere.

30:23.959 --> 30:27.417
- Ah.
- Yeah, just the way it is.

30:28.542 --> 30:31.750
And...I'm sorry

30:31.834 --> 30:33.959
<i>fiancee.</i>

30:34.041 --> 30:37.333
You know, in some ways..

30:37.417 --> 30:40.250
...you remind me
a lot of Yates.

30:40.333 --> 30:42.417
- Well, without the..
- Chip on her shoulder?

30:42.500 --> 30:44.083
And the foot in her mouth.

30:46.834 --> 30:49.542
You'd make a good agent.

30:49.625 --> 30:50.583
(male #4)
'Two more beers.'

30:50.667 --> 30:52.542
- Alright.
- Alright.

30:52.625 --> 30:55.709
[chuckles]
Then I say...hold on a second.

30:57.875 --> 31:01.250
- Lose something?
- No, no.

31:01.333 --> 31:04.083
Yeah. The keys.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.250
I'm sure they're back
in the restaurant.

31:06.333 --> 31:08.542
Uh, they're right there.

31:10.709 --> 31:11.709
No.

31:13.583 --> 31:17.083
Okay, let's see, uh, wet
roads this time of the
evening.

31:17.166 --> 31:20.125
I'd say it'd take AAA about
three hours to get here.

31:22.583 --> 31:24.125
You know, I had
a blind date
once

31:24.208 --> 31:26.333
who locked his keys
in the car on
purpose

31:26.417 --> 31:28.375
because he thought he'd
spend more time with me.

31:28.458 --> 31:29.959
Oh, yeah?

31:32.166 --> 31:34.125
Did it work?

31:38.000 --> 31:39.041
Oh.

31:42.542 --> 31:44.166
Alright, careful.

31:51.834 --> 31:53.625
Maybe we shouldn't drive.

31:53.709 --> 31:55.041
Yeah.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.458
Gambling with your career,
you better be damn sure

32:11.542 --> 32:13.333
you know what you're doing.

32:13.417 --> 32:17.458
Uh, feeling lucky, like I have
the winning numbers.

32:17.542 --> 32:19.792
1-5-7-2-6-8.

32:19.875 --> 32:21.875
'Sound familiar?
Your old informant ID.'

32:21.959 --> 32:24.875
Here's another number
for you, F-D-395

32:24.959 --> 32:26.834
'FBI Advice of Rights form'

32:26.917 --> 32:28.083
just in case we
have to arrest you

32:28.166 --> 32:29.375
at the conclusion
of this interview.

32:29.458 --> 32:31.166
Perhaps I need
to speak to my
lawyer.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.333
(Ryan)
'Well, that's your
prerogative.'

32:32.417 --> 32:33.792
Of course, the press might

32:33.875 --> 32:34.917
have her file by then.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.625
Left wing Democrat informing

32:36.709 --> 32:38.166
on an anti-war organization?

32:38.250 --> 32:40.542
(Lilly)
'That's a front-page
scandal.'

32:45.458 --> 32:48.917
I got busted for pot in my dorm.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.375
The FBI saw an opening.

32:51.458 --> 32:54.709
Promised me they could
get the charges erased.

32:54.792 --> 32:57.417
If you informed on Reuben
and his organization?

32:57.500 --> 33:00.750
I didn't want to
disappoint my father
again.

33:00.834 --> 33:02.500
What happened after
you left Reuben?

33:02.583 --> 33:03.750
'Did you see David again?'

33:03.834 --> 33:05.709
Truth is, I was lost.

33:05.792 --> 33:08.542
Only thing that
made sense was him.

33:11.750 --> 33:13.250
That guy, Reuben..

33:15.458 --> 33:17.500
...you love him?

33:19.625 --> 33:21.583
I got people in trouble.

33:22.625 --> 33:24.917
Narced on Reuben,
his friends.

33:26.625 --> 33:27.917
Betrayed him.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.166
Why?

33:29.250 --> 33:31.583
Had no choice.

33:31.667 --> 33:33.834
At least that's
what I thought.

33:35.625 --> 33:38.458
I don't know what
to believe
anymore.

33:38.542 --> 33:40.667
You know, the other
night with you..

33:42.166 --> 33:44.333
...that's the first night
I've slept in a year.

33:45.125 --> 33:47.250
I did things over there..

33:49.041 --> 33:51.667
...things I can't ever undo.

33:51.750 --> 33:53.959
(Annabelle)
'You had to survive.'

33:54.041 --> 33:56.125
I fulfilled my obligation.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.166
Volunteered the first time.

34:00.709 --> 34:02.542
I don't want to go back.

34:05.166 --> 34:07.542
That farmer..

34:07.625 --> 34:10.792
...he's going to
buy my old beater..

34:10.875 --> 34:13.125
...and the money will be
enough to get us to Canada.

34:13.208 --> 34:15.625
You're asking me
to run away with
you?

34:15.709 --> 34:17.625
We can start all over.

34:17.709 --> 34:19.208
Get things back to like
they were on the bus.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.792
- It's not that simple.
- Yes.

34:23.041 --> 34:24.542
Yes, it is.

34:29.208 --> 34:30.917
Wait for me here?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.125
I don't know, David.

34:33.208 --> 34:34.792
It's okay.

34:36.166 --> 34:37.417
I do.

34:44.417 --> 34:47.542
I waited around
a couple of hours..

34:47.625 --> 34:50.500
...until I realized
how crazy it all was.

34:52.667 --> 34:54.959
David came back for you.

34:56.417 --> 34:57.333
I don't understand.

34:57.417 --> 34:59.375
He crawled
through the woods

34:59.458 --> 35:01.834
and died under that tree.

35:04.792 --> 35:06.542
(Annabelle)
'I had a chance.'

35:08.583 --> 35:10.709
I didn't take it.

35:11.750 --> 35:13.792
I never felt that way again.

35:13.875 --> 35:16.333
Director instructed us
to keep your involvement

35:16.417 --> 35:18.000
'out of the press.'

35:22.041 --> 35:23.291
Thank you.

35:24.917 --> 35:27.542
- Hey, Jimmy, give us a
minute.
- Okay.

35:31.458 --> 35:32.875
What's up?

35:32.959 --> 35:35.041
- You talk to Roy?
- About what?

35:36.458 --> 35:37.458
That son of a bitch.

35:37.542 --> 35:39.208
Is this about
the break-in or
Roy?

35:39.291 --> 35:41.375
He's cheating on you, Meg.

35:48.291 --> 35:51.667
The investigation
took a turn, and it..

35:51.750 --> 35:53.208
...turns out he's
having an affair.

35:53.291 --> 35:54.875
Who is it?

35:56.208 --> 35:57.709
Does it matter?

35:57.792 --> 36:00.375
What does the break-in have
to do with my husband cheating?

36:00.458 --> 36:01.875
She was there that night.

36:03.583 --> 36:06.625
'I'll spare you the details,
but long story short, your..'

36:06.709 --> 36:09.667
...genius husband staged
that robbery to cover it up.

36:10.834 --> 36:12.917
Guess I should've
seen it coming.

36:13.959 --> 36:15.500
I want to know who
you were texting.

36:15.583 --> 36:18.542
- It was business.
- Business that couldn't
wait?

36:18.625 --> 36:20.166
The-the Peterson
deal is cratering.

36:20.250 --> 36:21.834
Can we go inside
and talk this
out?

36:21.917 --> 36:24.291
Talk what out?

36:27.750 --> 36:30.583
Hey. Hey, hey. Look! I don't
want to fight anymore, baby.

36:30.667 --> 36:31.750
Please.

36:32.875 --> 36:34.208
How about we go
away next weekend?

36:34.291 --> 36:36.375
I'll leave my phone at home.

36:38.542 --> 36:41.500
- Only if you promise.
- I promise.

36:49.375 --> 36:52.000
There's somebody
in the house.

36:52.083 --> 36:53.166
Stay here.

36:53.750 --> 36:55.875
I just..

36:55.959 --> 36:58.709
...kept thinking he
was going to change.

36:59.542 --> 37:01.375
Hey.

37:01.458 --> 37:03.458
You can't blame
yourself here.

37:05.750 --> 37:09.083
Nothing's turned
out like I
thought.

37:09.166 --> 37:11.625
What am I
supposed to do now?

37:11.709 --> 37:13.625
For starters, you
get rid of that bum.

37:13.709 --> 37:15.917
I'm 40 years old.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.375
Tough just to...start over.

37:21.542 --> 37:23.792
Things haven't gone
exactly according to plan

37:23.875 --> 37:25.250
for me either, so..

37:25.333 --> 37:26.625
(Megan)
'Oh, Nicky.'

37:26.709 --> 37:28.792
Never even asked
how you're doing.

37:35.458 --> 37:37.709
Hey! Hey, you can't be in here.

37:37.792 --> 37:39.375
Oh, got a sneak
and peek warrant.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.959
We're taking
a quick look around.

37:42.041 --> 37:43.583
I already told you..

37:43.667 --> 37:45.500
...I had no beef
with that soldier.

37:45.583 --> 37:47.750
I've got nothing but respect
for anybody that served.

37:47.834 --> 37:49.333
See, that's what
we don't get, Al.

37:49.417 --> 37:51.250
Why is a
respectful
vet like yourself

37:51.333 --> 37:53.667
getting into
fights
with other GIs?

37:53.750 --> 37:55.125
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:55.208 --> 37:56.333
Well, it says here you got into

37:56.417 --> 37:58.333
a brawl at an anti-war rally

37:58.417 --> 38:01.375
brained a veteran against
the war with a tire iron.

38:01.458 --> 38:03.750
Those men turned
against their own.

38:05.792 --> 38:08.375
- Like David?
- Hey. Listen. He--

38:08.458 --> 38:09.667
He was going to
run off to Canada.

38:09.750 --> 38:12.083
He helped me
out and he left.

38:16.500 --> 38:18.709
Well, then, how do
you explain this?

38:19.792 --> 38:22.750
It's a Ford
Galaxie.
David Quinn's
car.

38:22.834 --> 38:26.166
Looked at your army
records,
Al. Wounded in A Shau.

38:26.250 --> 38:29.208
Board decided you
weren't fit for
duty..

38:29.291 --> 38:30.875
...dismissed you.

38:30.959 --> 38:32.041
But you wouldn't give up.

38:32.125 --> 38:34.291
I can drive a tractor
sunup to sundown

38:34.375 --> 38:38.125
plow 800 acres of open
fields and I'm not fit?

38:38.208 --> 38:40.875
David was fit for duty..

38:40.959 --> 38:43.834
...but he didn't
want to fight
anymore.

38:43.917 --> 38:45.542
Look, you gotta understand

38:45.625 --> 38:48.166
I-I would've
died to go back.

38:48.250 --> 38:51.083
I tried to tell that kid,
but he-he wouldn't listen.

38:51.166 --> 38:52.709
Tell him what?

38:52.792 --> 38:54.333
How much I love my country.

38:54.417 --> 38:58.667
I couldn't understand how
another soldier would betray
it.

39:05.458 --> 39:06.583
Going through my stuff?

39:06.667 --> 39:09.000
Says you're due back
at Fort Dix at 0600.

39:10.333 --> 39:12.458
Didn't tell me you
were going back to 'Nam.

39:12.542 --> 39:14.709
Gonna hitch
a ride back to
base.

39:16.166 --> 39:18.417
Got the money
for my car?

39:18.500 --> 39:20.792
Do you one better,
I'll give you a lift.

39:22.250 --> 39:24.875
- No, really, don't sweat
it.
- I insist.

39:26.709 --> 39:29.166
I'm not looking
for a problem
here.

39:31.291 --> 39:33.125
You a coward, boy?

39:37.250 --> 39:38.959
What, are you-you gonna
force me to go back?

39:39.041 --> 39:42.291
- You have a duty.
- A duty to what? War?

39:42.375 --> 39:43.792
You must have
seen stuff
too.

39:43.875 --> 39:45.625
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, come on, man.

39:45.709 --> 39:47.291
Tiger Force.

39:47.375 --> 39:48.625
Lurps.

39:48.709 --> 39:49.834
You were up
close and
personal.

39:49.917 --> 39:51.083
You don't know what I saw.

39:51.166 --> 39:52.667
No, I know what I saw.

39:53.917 --> 39:56.458
Children..

39:56.542 --> 39:58.041
...ripped apart by bullets.

39:58.125 --> 39:59.250
Women dragged into..

39:59.333 --> 40:00.834
...into huts to
do God knows what.

40:00.917 --> 40:03.792
Things I can't, I
can't
get out of my head.

40:03.875 --> 40:06.417
A little girl screaming in
her,
in her dead mother's arms.

40:06.500 --> 40:07.458
- Shut up.
- Grip so tight.

40:07.542 --> 40:08.542
I have to, to break

40:08.625 --> 40:09.750
her forearm just
to get her free.

40:09.834 --> 40:11.583
[shouting]
Shut up! Shut up!

40:15.875 --> 40:18.583
I don't want to see that
face in my dreams anymore.

40:23.750 --> 40:25.834
My girl's waiting.

40:31.875 --> 40:34.125
You got to go.
Honor your commitment!

40:34.208 --> 40:36.709
Why? Why? Why do I got
to go, huh? Tell me
why!
