News of this latest crater

00:05.839 --> 00:07.473
was first reported
late last night

00:07.507 --> 00:09.675
by local residents
having been awoken

00:09.709 --> 00:12.344
to the sound
of a massive explosion.

00:12.379 --> 00:16.015
Some even say that they thought
it was a sonic boom,

00:16.049 --> 00:17.616
with nearby homes shaking,

00:17.650 --> 00:21.120
and in some cases,
even windows were blown out.

00:21.154 --> 00:23.789
The cause of the ruptures
is still unknown,

00:23.823 --> 00:25.290
and local authorities,

00:25.325 --> 00:28.293
along with a team of scientists
from the Institute,

00:28.328 --> 00:30.129
are on-site as we speak.

00:30.163 --> 00:33.098
Burning like an inferno,
the gaping chasm

00:33.133 --> 00:36.668
is estimated to be
a whopping 100 feet across,

00:36.703 --> 00:39.371
with a yet undetermined depth.

00:39.406 --> 00:41.006
In the nearby town of Vonsk,

00:41.041 --> 00:43.108
local residents are
in a state of panic,

00:43.143 --> 00:45.477

a mile of the crater...
