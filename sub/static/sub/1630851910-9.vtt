00:06.040 --> 00:09.960
A NETFLIX SERIES

01:28.480 --> 01:30.320
Yesterday was a terrible day,

01:31.920 --> 01:33.600
but I won't give up, Doctor.

01:35.080 --> 01:37.960
And your husband?
How has he been? More relaxed?

01:38.600 --> 01:40.560
I'm not talking about my husband.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.920
-You're not?
-No.

02:33.560 --> 02:35.360
I'm not talking about my husband.

02:36.280 --> 02:38.120
-You're not?
-No.

02:38.960 --> 02:42.840
I'm in a relationship with someone else.

02:44.440 --> 02:45.800
I'm in love

02:47.640 --> 02:49.240
with a woman.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.000
Her name is Mia.

03:12.640 --> 03:13.920
I can still feel my foot.

03:14.440 --> 03:17.320
It's normal.
The brain plays tricks on you.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.400
Is the pain better?

03:22.520 --> 03:25.960
You'll be back in Portugal in no time.
And back to your family too.

03:26.880 --> 03:30.640
What will my life be like?
How am I supposed to work like this?

03:30.720 --> 03:32.400
You'll get a prosthetic leg soon.

03:35.480 --> 03:36.960
And when my wife sees me like this?

03:37.480 --> 03:40.200
Your wife will thank God
that you came back alive.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.560
Believe me.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.880
-Private Fernando Marcelino?
-Bed six.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.080
Mário?

04:27.160 --> 04:28.800
So how are they treating you?

04:30.880 --> 04:31.800
Not bad.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.320
You should have shot yourself in the head.

04:42.880 --> 04:45.440
At least you'd save your family
the embarrassment.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.960
You can't tell anyone.

04:48.920 --> 04:49.920
They'll take my medal.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.560
-I can't go back to Glória as--
-As what?

04:56.120 --> 04:57.280
As what, Fernando?

05:05.200 --> 05:06.920
You know what you are.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.280
-Well? What's coming through?
-Nothing.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.280
Budapest, Krakow, and Zagreb
are also blocked.

06:45.360 --> 06:47.480
Nothing. So let's change
the frequency again.

06:47.560 --> 06:51.120
I'll change the transmitter
and also switch to a rhombic antenna.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.320
-That's best. I'll connect R1.
-Not R1, R2.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.120
R1 is under maintenance. Come on.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.440
Right, R2 it is.
I'll use the general one, so it's quicker.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.800
Attention, deactivating seven.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.360
-Seven deactivated.
-Hurry.

07:09.760 --> 07:14.280
Let's switch to 11885, R2.

07:14.360 --> 07:15.600
Rhombic antenna R2.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.080
Sir?

07:19.960 --> 07:20.800
Yes, Roberto.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.040
They called again
from the hospital in Santarém.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.760
-Keep saying I'm not here.
-I am, but she insists.

07:25.840 --> 07:28.960
-She'll get the hint and get tired.
-I don't think she will.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.080
Vidal!

07:33.280 --> 07:34.280
I need your help.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.360
We can't broadcast Nixon's speech
to Moscow or anywhere.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.880
-The frequencies are blocked.
-I'll climb the antenna.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.240
That sounds good.
We'll start transmitting from R2.

07:42.320 --> 07:45.120
That fucking cowboy
was enjoying watching us fail.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.000
Darling,

07:48.960 --> 07:51.760
didn't you find it odd
the engineer was interested in you?

07:52.280 --> 07:55.400
-You don't think I deserve it?
-You deserve everything, Carolina.

07:55.480 --> 07:56.400
Everything.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.760
It's just that…

08:00.680 --> 08:01.560
Listen.

08:02.800 --> 08:06.240
Somebody told me that he was
with another woman in Santarém yesterday.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.480
I don't believe you.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.520
That's what I heard.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.240
Carolina!

08:40.120 --> 08:42.040
-Mom?
-Hello, darling.

08:42.560 --> 08:43.720
Come in.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.520
Well, this is unexpected.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.760
I thought your living room
would be messier.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.320
Would you like something to drink?

09:10.640 --> 09:14.280
Your father's been complaining
that you haven't been taking his calls.

09:15.480 --> 09:18.360
I've been swamped with work.
We're building a new antenna.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.520
You don't need to make excuses.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.240
We know why you're acting like this.

09:24.600 --> 09:28.000
It's because of what you found out.
The girl.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.440
You know about her?

09:41.720 --> 09:43.360
I'd like a glass of water.

09:46.840 --> 09:49.400
Those two years you were in the war, João,

09:50.760 --> 09:52.280
I wasn't able to sleep.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.920
I don't need more reasons to worry.

10:00.880 --> 10:05.640
And your father has done everything he can
to give me peace of mind.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.560
You should drink less.

10:28.480 --> 10:29.840
It helps me sleep.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.120
I'd rather have whiskey than pills.

10:40.280 --> 10:41.320
Hello, Roberto.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.600
Carolina. How can I help?

10:44.120 --> 10:46.560
I've always been curious
about what you do here.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.480
Must be so complicated
to control the switchboard.

10:49.560 --> 10:50.560
No, it's easy.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.880
-Come in. I'll show you.
-Thank you.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.000
RARET, good morning.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.640
One moment.
I'll see if she can take the call.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.240
Nobody's answering at home.
Do you want to leave a message?

11:20.440 --> 11:21.960
Of course. Goodbye.

11:24.400 --> 11:29.040
Now I just need to write down
who called and who the call was for.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.880
You have beautiful penmanship.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.000
I've had a lot of training.

11:34.280 --> 11:35.760
-May I?
-Sure.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.240
LOURDES MATOS - MR. JOÃO VIDAL - SANTARÉM

11:45.640 --> 11:47.960
-Are you okay?
-Just tired.

11:49.720 --> 11:50.800
I heard about Fernando.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.520
The important thing is he's alive, right?

11:55.480 --> 11:56.360
Yes.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.440
RARET, good morning.

14:15.640 --> 14:18.120
I know you were
with another woman yesterday.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.200
It's not what you think.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.360
It never is.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.880
Nothing happened, Carolina.
She had some information.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.080
We talked. That's all.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.920
You have a way with words.

14:39.760 --> 14:40.960
I have to go.

14:41.720 --> 14:42.760
Stay.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.400
I'm willing to risk everything
to be with you.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.160
And what are you actually risking?

15:07.560 --> 15:11.360
I'm risking my life.
If you wanted, you could have reported me.

15:14.040 --> 15:16.120
I just want you to take me away from here.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.480
-Here.
-Thank you.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.440
Wasn't João coming over?

15:33.800 --> 15:37.160
I saw a woman
going into his house this afternoon.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.240
It was his mother.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.960
His mother? Then his mother
looks really good for her age.

15:42.040 --> 15:45.160
You two…
Half of what people say isn't true.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.000
I think you're just jealous.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.240
He had barely arrived here,
and he was banging a chick in the studio.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.400
-Who?
-Don't tell me it was the wife--

15:54.480 --> 15:55.960
-No.
-Was it the American's wife?

15:56.040 --> 15:57.600
-Not at all. Forget that.
-Come on.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.480
It's just us here. Tell us.

15:59.560 --> 16:02.160
I've said too much.
If he didn't tell you, I won't either.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.160
Tell us who it was. Come on.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.360
-I thought you knew.
-I don't.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.040
The foreign one.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.720
The translator who left
because of the screwup with the reel.

16:14.800 --> 16:15.720
The one who had…

16:16.600 --> 16:18.760
Man, João!

16:19.280 --> 16:20.200
Ursula?

16:20.720 --> 16:22.120
Wait a minute…

16:22.200 --> 16:23.520
Are you sure?

16:23.600 --> 16:26.240
I saw the state
in which they left the studio.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.560
I'm not stupid.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.520
She had that look.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.160
Yeah. She's hot.

18:36.680 --> 18:37.840
Hello, Xico.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.560
I brought the eggs you asked for.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.120
-Thank you. Good night.
-Bye. Good night.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.760
AVANTE!
THE COLONIES WILL WIN

19:03.840 --> 19:05.520
FIGHT - UNITED - PORTUGAL

19:16.400 --> 19:17.640
Your father is not here.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.560
It's you I want to talk to.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.640
I want to apologize for how I spoke
to you yesterday when you came to visit.

19:30.480 --> 19:32.800
He promised me
he would not visit her again.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.440
In Dad's mind,
it's not such a serious thing.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.040
Of course it is.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.720
Don't think that he doesn't feel guilty,

19:42.440 --> 19:43.680
because he does.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.280
Don't make excuses for him, Mom.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.120
Of course not.

20:48.120 --> 20:50.320
-Is that it?
-That's all I was told.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.000
Get out of the car!

22:00.640 --> 22:01.640
Son.

22:02.480 --> 22:03.360
You're here.

22:04.680 --> 22:07.480
You're here. That's all that matters.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.240
Fernando.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.040
See if it fits.

22:28.920 --> 22:29.840
Thank you, Mom.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.200
-One more?
-I can't.

22:32.280 --> 22:34.880
-Come on, it's the good stuff.
-I have Mass at 7:00.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.480
This will cheer you up.

22:37.280 --> 22:40.120
-Maybe you can talk about our hero here.
-Of course I will.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.440
Enough, Dad.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.800
Men are defined
by what they do at important times, right?

22:44.880 --> 22:48.080
Men need good examples, Fernando.
Like you.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.200
What they need is for this war to end.

23:27.920 --> 23:28.960
Fill it up.

23:41.960 --> 23:42.920
What are you doing?

23:45.320 --> 23:46.520
Stop it!

23:47.120 --> 23:49.240
I washed it yesterday.
I don't need you to.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.200
Did you hear me?

23:53.680 --> 23:56.280
Did you hear me? Stop it!

23:57.200 --> 24:00.880
Stop it. I don't need it.
See what you did? You idiot!

24:06.520 --> 24:09.120
It's okay, Zé. I'll clean it up.

24:09.200 --> 24:11.200
It's okay. I'll clean it up.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.440
Stop it!

24:15.720 --> 24:17.000
It's okay. Don't worry.

24:24.480 --> 24:25.960
It's okay, Zé.

25:10.080 --> 25:13.120
The explosives never would have made it
through the gate.

25:13.640 --> 25:15.040
Does everybody know?

25:15.800 --> 25:17.720
-About Roberto and Ermelinda?
-No.

25:17.800 --> 25:21.160
We'll say that the car
went off the road and burst into flames.

25:27.560 --> 25:28.600
Cristina?

25:29.120 --> 25:31.400
Please help Ramiro.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.480
Yes, ma'am.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.840
I HAVE MIA'S DIARY.
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU TONIGHT AT THE DAM.

27:11.960 --> 27:14.280
Get up. You have a visitor.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.160
Could we have some privacy, please?

27:50.120 --> 27:51.640
What do you want from me?

27:55.480 --> 27:59.280
I can get you out of here.

27:59.800 --> 28:04.640
Or at least move you
to the common prison ward, but…

28:05.280 --> 28:08.880
that depends on how our conversation goes,
of course.

28:08.960 --> 28:11.120
How many more times do I have to say this?

28:11.200 --> 28:14.440
I didn't know anything.
I didn't suspect anything. Ursula…

28:16.880 --> 28:18.200
It doesn't make sense.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.080
She may have been deceived.

28:26.680 --> 28:27.960
Manipulated.

28:36.360 --> 28:37.320
Did you…

28:40.080 --> 28:44.160
did you know
that your wife was seeing other men?

28:44.240 --> 28:45.400
One man.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.040
How did…

29:00.840 --> 29:03.800
how did you find out
that your wife had a lover?

29:04.320 --> 29:06.200
Some things you just feel.

29:06.840 --> 29:09.000
And when I confronted her,
she didn't deny it.

29:10.840 --> 29:14.680
Do you know the name
of your wife's friend?

29:15.680 --> 29:16.680
I don't know.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.960
All I know
is that he worked at the National Radio.

30:21.760 --> 30:22.960
You?

30:28.000 --> 30:28.960
Sit down.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.480
I was beginning to lose hope
that you'd show up.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.000
MIA ORLOV

31:01.200 --> 31:02.920
-Who killed her?
-Not me.

31:05.960 --> 31:07.120
Not me.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.720
What's in the diary?

31:16.720 --> 31:19.960
She wrote about your meetings,
among many other things.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.600
Are you with PIDE?
Or do you work for the Americans?

31:26.920 --> 31:28.880
I'm going to ask you one more time.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.000
Who killed her?

31:35.600 --> 31:37.320
What will happen to me?

31:39.480 --> 31:40.960
If you tell the truth, nothing.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.080
I found out a few days before she died…

31:56.600 --> 31:58.600
that she was working for the Russians.

32:03.600 --> 32:08.000
She told me
that she had arranged a passport for me.

32:10.280 --> 32:12.800
And that we were going
to Hungary from Austria.

32:17.280 --> 32:19.120
-What else?
-Nothing else.

32:24.320 --> 32:27.600
On the day we had planned to escape,
I waited here for her.

32:29.680 --> 32:32.840
But as she didn't show up,
I thought she had abandoned me.

32:43.840 --> 32:44.800
What now?

37:30.000 --> 37:31.200
Well?

37:32.400 --> 37:33.600
Everything okay?

37:36.480 --> 37:37.440
Is this Bernardino's?

37:37.520 --> 37:39.800
Yes. We're on this frequency here.

37:40.760 --> 37:41.600
This one.

38:18.200 --> 38:19.240
Fernando?

38:20.280 --> 38:21.440
Is everything okay?

38:22.640 --> 38:24.000
Why wouldn't it be?

38:28.840 --> 38:30.560
You didn't come to bed.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.360
I don't sleep much now.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.320
I dreamed about Ermelinda.

38:45.680 --> 38:47.720
I dreamed she was still alive.

41:33.200 --> 41:35.400
-Gonçalo?
-Minister.

41:36.560 --> 41:38.400
Did we have an appointment?

41:38.960 --> 41:41.400
No. No, we didn't.

41:48.040 --> 41:50.600
So, Gonçalo, tell me. What's this about?

41:52.120 --> 41:53.640
It's about your son.

41:55.280 --> 41:58.800
He's always in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

42:06.200 --> 42:08.280
I'm afraid I don't understand.

42:09.560 --> 42:13.880
Minister, I found out that João
had an affair with the female translator

42:13.960 --> 42:16.240
who was accused
of switching the reel at RARET.

42:17.920 --> 42:21.080
And yesterday I saw him
sneaking out of James's office.

42:21.600 --> 42:22.600
At night.

42:23.240 --> 42:24.240
He has a key.

42:27.640 --> 42:30.720
Your son is the spy
the Americans are looking for.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.240
How are you, Sofia?

43:45.720 --> 43:46.840
Are you going away?

43:55.160 --> 43:57.120
It was Ramiro who killed Mia.

43:58.520 --> 44:00.520
He was late for his training in Berlin.

44:01.200 --> 44:02.640
I don't know anything about that.

44:11.440 --> 44:13.240
Why are you still with him?

44:19.000 --> 44:20.880
You should have left with Mia.
