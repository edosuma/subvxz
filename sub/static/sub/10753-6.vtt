WEBVTT

00:07.674 --> 00:09.949
You're listening to KACL,

00:10.385 --> 00:12.421
780 on your AM dial.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.843
This is Dr Frasier Crane.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.976
Our lines are open.
So please give us a call.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.420
I'm just sitting here waiting.

00:23.898 --> 00:27.095
Seattle, come on,
I know you're out there.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.472
I realise it's a sunny day,

00:29.738 --> 00:32.570
but on the rainy days
I was there for you.

00:35.326 --> 00:39.717
All right, if that's the way you want it,
you leave me no recourse.

00:40.081 --> 00:44.950
# When the moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza... #

00:45.337 --> 00:49.250
Ah, seems I got you going there, OK!
All right, then.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.582
I knew you were out there.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.993
OK, Roz, who do we have?

00:54.262 --> 00:58.050
We have Gary on line two.
He and his wife had a fight.

00:58.391 --> 01:01.827
Sorry to hear that, Gary. I'm listening.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.854
'My wife's hell-bent
on going to Italy this year.'

01:06.191 --> 01:08.341
Ah, Italia!

01:08.610 --> 01:12.683
The rolling hills of Toscana,
the art of Firenze,

01:13.031 --> 01:16.182
the passion that is Venezia!

01:16.493 --> 01:21.772
'Yeah, well, anyway, I like taking
a vacation as much as the next guy,

01:22.165 --> 01:24.121
'but if we dip into our savings,

01:24.376 --> 01:29.166
'we should buy a new sump pump
for the basement...'

01:29.547 --> 01:33.256
Let me stop you there.
I'm siding with your wife here.

01:33.593 --> 01:39.145
'But it's 1,800 bucks, without
the Splendours of the Vatican package.'

01:39.557 --> 01:43.311
There is more to life than sump pumps.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.034
Whatever happened
to feeding our souls?

01:48.316 --> 01:51.547
I purchased a painting
by one of our premier artists.

01:51.861 --> 01:56.810
Oh, it's not important who.
Well, it's Seattle's own Martha Paxton.

01:57.575 --> 01:59.531
Practical, no, but...

01:59.786 --> 02:03.779
Ever since acquiring that painting,
I look at it every day

02:04.124 --> 02:07.560
and every time I do,
I'm uplifted by its beauty.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.710
So, Gary, go to Italy.

02:11.006 --> 02:14.362
Bring back a suitcase full of memories.
Will you do that?

02:14.676 --> 02:18.385
'l still think
I should get the sump pump.'

02:18.722 --> 02:23.477
Well, then yes, Gary, you...
You should get the sump pump.

02:24.602 --> 02:27.594
We'll be right back
after this newsbreak.

02:29.733 --> 02:33.885
Roz? Uh, just what is a sump pump?

02:34.279 --> 02:36.235
If you need one, you'll know.

02:36.489 --> 02:40.448
Do you own a Paxton or were you
blowing sunshine up Gary's skirt?

02:40.785 --> 02:45.461
- Yes, indeed, I do own a Paxton.
- She's on line three.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.869
A pre-eminent neo-fauvist
and you put her on hold!

02:49.169 --> 02:51.683
Well, the phone rang, I...

02:53.298 --> 02:56.768
Ms Paxton, oh, I'm so sorry
to have kept you waiting.

02:57.093 --> 02:59.049
Well, thank you!

02:59.304 --> 03:03.343
Yes. I'm very flattered
that you listen to my little show.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.799
Yes, I meant every word.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.456
That's lovely.
I'd like to meet you, too, sometime.

03:10.774 --> 03:16.132
I'm having a few friends over
for a little gathering this Friday night

03:16.529 --> 03:18.520
for some cocktails and such.

03:18.782 --> 03:23.173
I suppose you're far too...
You would? Oh, that's marvellous!

03:23.536 --> 03:26.050
It's the Elliott Bay Towers,

03:26.331 --> 03:30.449
on the counterbalance,
around 7:00 is fine.

03:30.794 --> 03:34.184
Well, I'll see you then.
Ciao!

03:35.423 --> 03:39.416
- I didn't know about your cocktail party.
- That makes two of us.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.581
(Piano is playing jazz)

03:48.978 --> 03:52.527
Me theory on death is,
you're whisked down a dark tunnel

03:52.857 --> 03:56.816
towards a white light and you
get all the jokes you never got before.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.621
You let out a little chuckle
and then you die.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.544
(Chuckles)

04:01.783 --> 04:06.015
Delightful story, but I think
the toast points need replenishing.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.327
Be right on it.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.622
Enchanting.

04:11.876 --> 04:14.674
Why is no-one eating
the mousseline of duck?

04:16.673 --> 04:20.427
You mangy little cur!
Get! Get! Get! Oh!

04:20.760 --> 04:22.955
Now we know why.

04:28.184 --> 04:31.574
The dog is eating the food,
the pianist is too intrusive,

04:31.896 --> 04:34.012
the Pinot Noir is far too stagy...

04:34.274 --> 04:39.143
- It's 7:05, and Martha isn't here.
- I won't have to sedate you, will l?

04:39.529 --> 04:43.841
No, I'm just on edge.
I want everything to be perfect.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.350
Where's Maris?
I haven't seen her all night.

04:46.619 --> 04:50.578
She's on your bed...
asleep under the guests' coats.

04:53.460 --> 04:57.009
She exhausts easily
under the pressure to be interesting.

04:59.007 --> 05:03.842
- She should be looking after Dad!
- He's in the bathroom.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.411
(Doorbell)

05:07.515 --> 05:09.904
That must be... La Paxton!

05:10.185 --> 05:13.541
And fashionably late, of course!

05:20.195 --> 05:22.345
Oh, hi, Roz, it's you.

05:22.614 --> 05:25.333
- And you look radiant!
- I look like crap.

05:25.617 --> 05:28.893
I stained my dress,
over-plucked one eyebrow,

05:29.204 --> 05:33.322
and the crotch of my pantyhose
is creeping down to my knees.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.210
Why not do it on the elevator?

05:42.050 --> 05:44.803
Oh, my goodness,
you've got a neck!

05:47.722 --> 05:50.680
What do you think?
Is it how you imagined?

05:50.975 --> 05:54.968
To be frank, I don't spend
my idle hours imagining how you live.

05:56.189 --> 06:00.705
But I did expect lots of beige.
And look, I was right.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.857
- Would you like a drink?
- Sure, something light.

06:05.156 --> 06:08.432
Double bourbon, rocks,
and spill a little in the glass.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.369
Oh, Daphne, you're here, too.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.217
My goodness, shouldn't you be mixing?

06:16.501 --> 06:19.459
Don't mind me.
I'm just getting some ice.

06:19.754 --> 06:23.508
- Lovely party, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

06:23.842 --> 06:26.959
This fresh fennel smells wonderful,
doesn't it?

06:27.262 --> 06:29.651
It certainly does.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.445
Dr Crane, were you sniffing my hair?

06:32.726 --> 06:36.355
Why would I do that?
I'm married, I love my Maris.

06:36.688 --> 06:41.204
- Where should I put this coat?
- Just throw it on the bed.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.760
So, which one is your dad?

06:45.030 --> 06:48.386
He's the gentleman showing
Bethany Van Pelt the photographs.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.656
Oh, my God!

06:51.911 --> 06:54.948
When we got to her,
it was hanging by two tendons.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.897
Would you excuse us, please?

07:00.712 --> 07:03.385
Stop showing crime scene photos.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.745
She was the one who brought it up!

07:07.052 --> 07:12.285
Oh, yeah, the Junior League head
brought up the subject of a hooker

07:12.682 --> 07:16.277
who was dismembered
and scattered in a warehouse?

07:16.603 --> 07:20.562
She asked, "Are these meatballs
the messiest thing you've ever seen?"

07:20.899 --> 07:23.936
- And I said "no...
- Dad, please!

07:24.235 --> 07:28.228
All right, but stop shadowing me!
I don't need a nursemaid!

07:28.573 --> 07:31.087
All right, just give me your word.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.404
Watch him!

07:34.496 --> 07:37.806
Hi, Niles. You may not remember me...

07:38.124 --> 07:41.355
I do! Be a love and watch
that man with a cane.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.190
(Doorbell)

07:43.505 --> 07:45.461
Everyone!

07:50.679 --> 07:52.715
Dr Crane?

07:52.972 --> 07:56.885
- I'm Martha Paxton.
- Of course. Who else could you be?

07:58.645 --> 08:01.443
Welcome to my salon.

08:03.233 --> 08:06.430
Everyone, your attention please!

08:06.736 --> 08:12.368
Let's welcome our guest of honour,
the renowned artist, Martha Paxton!

08:15.870 --> 08:21.149
- May I take your...poncho?
- No, I never take it off at parties.

08:21.543 --> 08:25.502
- So I don't have to shake hands.
- How delightfully eccentric.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.353
You must meet my brother Niles.
Oh, Niles!

08:30.427 --> 08:34.385
Ms Paxton? Dr Niles Crane.
It's an honour to shake your hand.

08:37.976 --> 08:41.332
Well, to shake anything of yours
is an honour.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.650
Now, where did you hang
my painting?

08:48.945 --> 08:51.505
I'd like to know how people
live with my work.

08:51.781 --> 08:56.571
"Live with my work."
I love that phrase. This way, please.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.990
This is the perfect spot
for an ideal viewing. Oh, God...

09:00.290 --> 09:05.284
I've waited so long for this moment.
I'll let you describe your work,

09:05.670 --> 09:08.867
"Elegy In Green," in your own words.

09:09.174 --> 09:12.450
You insinuate the palette
but never lean on it.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.355
You've captured the Zeitgeist!

09:15.638 --> 09:19.233
It's the most perfect canvas
I've gazed upon.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.517
One can only imagine
what inspired you to paint it!

09:22.812 --> 09:25.280
I didn't paint it.

09:27.567 --> 09:33.119
Well, of course you didn't.
You created it, you gave birth to it.

09:33.531 --> 09:38.924
I didn't do anything to it.
I never saw this painting before.

09:41.081 --> 09:44.471
And you thought
I was going to embarrass you.

09:48.630 --> 09:51.781
- I liked your friend, Roz.
- What?

09:52.092 --> 09:55.687
Roz, at the party tonight.
Nice gal. Ask her out.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.971
She's great-looking
and she can really hold her liquor.

10:00.308 --> 10:03.857
Dad, you mind?
I've had the most humiliating evening.

10:04.187 --> 10:07.896
I've been made a fool of
by this...this thing.

10:09.776 --> 10:13.735
I may be just a girl from Manchester,
but I have to tell you.

10:14.072 --> 10:17.303
Even though it's not a Paxton,
I really like it.

10:17.617 --> 10:23.533
I liked it before I even knew
who Martha Paxton was and, frankly,

10:23.957 --> 10:27.154
I don't think that woman bathes.

10:28.545 --> 10:32.379
Enjoy it while you can,
because it's going back to the dealer.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.672
I'll demand my money back.

10:34.926 --> 10:37.076
No one takes advantage
of Frasier Crane!

10:37.345 --> 10:40.223
You're upset. I'll return it for you.

10:40.515 --> 10:45.191
I appreciate the gesture, but what
do you know about the art world?

10:45.562 --> 10:48.872
Apparently about as much as you do.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:59.617 --> 11:01.687
I can see the love in your eyes.

11:03.288 --> 11:06.678
You must have this painting.
- Are you the owner?

11:07.000 --> 11:10.276
- Yes, I am, Philip Hayson.
- I'm Dr Frasier Crane.

11:10.587 --> 11:14.660
- I have a little...
-The Dr Frasier Crane on the radio?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.919
Guilty, yes.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.294
My wife and I love your show.
Could I have your autograph?

11:20.597 --> 11:25.466
But speaking of autographs,
I have a problem with this painting.

11:26.311 --> 11:30.304
- Would you like a glass of wine?
- Actually...

11:30.648 --> 11:35.676
We toured the Loire Valley
and we bought four cases of this.

11:36.071 --> 11:38.824
It's quite extraordinary.

11:39.115 --> 11:43.154
- I'd rather not have any wine...
- Just a moment, just...

11:45.163 --> 11:48.838
- Oh, it finishes well.
- Would you like more?

11:49.167 --> 11:56.676
No, thank you. I gave a small soiree
which Martha Paxton attended

11:57.175 --> 12:01.851
and she told me
that this painting was not her work.

12:02.222 --> 12:05.180
I can imagine
how embarrassing that was.

12:05.475 --> 12:09.354
- I doubt it.
- Let's take a look at that

12:09.688 --> 12:11.963
in a slightly better light, shall we?

12:14.734 --> 12:17.294
Oh, yes, I remember this.
It's breathtaking.

12:18.154 --> 12:21.146
Ronald, Diane,
will you step in here?

12:21.449 --> 12:26.682
Remember when this piece was in
the gallery, everyone wanted it?

12:27.080 --> 12:29.196
Yes, it's special.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.415
Mrs Chitcherelli wanted to buy it.

12:32.711 --> 12:35.783
Yes, but it's not a Paxton.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.161
It says here that it is a Paxton.
The signature...

12:41.511 --> 12:44.309
Martha Paxton says it's not a Paxton!

12:44.597 --> 12:48.510
- Oh, Martha! How is the old dear?
- She and I go back a long way.

12:48.852 --> 12:53.368
- Is she still...?
- As a melon, yes.

12:53.732 --> 12:57.361
- More wine?
- No, I want to discuss this painting.

12:57.694 --> 13:01.892
- Some brie?
- No, I don't want any brie.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.276
I want my money back!

13:04.534 --> 13:08.846
That's where things
might just get a bit prickly.

13:09.205 --> 13:13.164
We have a strict policy here.
All sales are final.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.299
- You'll make an exception.
- I can't.

13:16.588 --> 13:21.184
- But it's a forgery.
- If it is, it's a damn good one.

13:21.551 --> 13:25.146
I'll make this simple,
I want my money.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.667
I'm sure you do.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.694
Oh, I know what you're doing.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.937
You're agreeing with me,
hoping I'll tire and leave.

13:36.232 --> 13:39.702
- Whatever you say.
- I don't believe it.

13:40.028 --> 13:43.384
You're shining me on!

13:43.698 --> 13:46.166
Where is the justice in this?

13:46.451 --> 13:53.163
If you ever find justice in
this world, let me know, will you?

13:53.625 --> 13:56.298
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some work to do.

13:56.586 --> 14:01.376
Did a crate of freshly painted
Rembrandts just arrive?

14:01.758 --> 14:06.036
You're not getting away with this.
I am not leaving!

14:15.814 --> 14:18.169
I thought you
were going to return it.

14:18.441 --> 14:21.001
They wouldn't take it back.

14:21.277 --> 14:25.589
All I got was a cheap glass of wine.
Loire Valley, my ass.

14:28.576 --> 14:32.205
- Now what?
- I'll call the police.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.212
- 555-3000.
- Thanks.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.784
Try to mess with Dr Frasier Crane.

14:39.045 --> 14:42.879
Hello... Oh, just a second.
Dad, who do I ask for?

14:43.216 --> 14:46.128
Fine Arts Forgery Department.

14:46.428 --> 14:51.377
Hello, yes, the Fine Arts
Forgery Department, please.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.615
Dad! They're laughing at me.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.258
Give me the phone.

15:08.074 --> 15:12.113
Hi, who's this?
Hey, Doris! Yeah, Marty Crane.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.410
Yeah, that was my son.

15:16.207 --> 15:19.438
I just thought he needed
a bite of a reality sandwich.

15:19.753 --> 15:25.191
Yeah, give my best to the guys.
Thanks. Yeah, bye.

15:25.592 --> 15:29.301
- What was that?
- They handle murders and robberies.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.673
No time for artsy-fartsy stuff.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.446
What am I supposed to do?
I've been cheated!

15:40.690 --> 15:43.158
What were you doing back there?

15:43.443 --> 15:48.039
Maris lost her earring. Daphne crawled
under the bed to look for it while I...

15:48.406 --> 15:50.158
Yes?

15:53.286 --> 15:55.322
...searched the credenza.

15:55.580 --> 15:58.936
Maybe it was trampled
into the hallway carpet

15:59.250 --> 16:01.559
when everybody stampeded
for the elevator.

16:01.836 --> 16:06.671
No one stampeded!
Good guests just know when to leave.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.723
- Two hours early.
- Shut up!

16:10.011 --> 16:15.165
Does this foul mood mean you were
unable to unload the bogus Paxton?

16:15.558 --> 16:17.310
Yes.

16:17.560 --> 16:21.439
What's the name
of that vicious lawyer you use?

16:21.773 --> 16:24.526
The one I used to sue the contractor
or to sue the personal trainer?

16:24.818 --> 16:26.888
- The meanest.
- The second one.

16:27.153 --> 16:31.783
- I used him to sue the first one.
- Give me his number.

16:32.158 --> 16:37.186
Forget it. Five years of litigation
will be eight times the painting's price.

16:39.124 --> 16:43.117
- I hate lawyers!
-They make wonderful patients.

16:43.461 --> 16:47.420
They have excellent health insurance
and they never get better.

16:51.594 --> 16:55.143
I know, I can use my radio show.

16:55.473 --> 16:58.783
I can use my bully pulpit to expose
that man for the fraud he is!

16:59.102 --> 17:01.662
They'll sue you for slander.

17:01.938 --> 17:05.646
Where is the justice?
Where can I turn to?

17:05.983 --> 17:09.532
I'm a beloved household name
and I've been screwed!

17:09.863 --> 17:13.333
You're 41.
It's time you learned something.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.569
The system ain't perfect.

17:15.827 --> 17:20.105
Sometimes the bad guy wins
and things you thought would help you,

17:20.457 --> 17:24.608
the courts and the police,
aren't there when you need them.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.111
So let it eat a hole in your stomach

17:27.380 --> 17:31.055
or file it away under the heading
"Sometimes life sucks".

17:31.384 --> 17:35.263
That file's getting pretty thick.

17:40.018 --> 17:43.055
So Hayson just gets away with it.

17:43.355 --> 17:49.112
He's sitting there with his wine
and his little chuckle at my expense.

17:49.527 --> 17:52.325
I see why people
take matters into their own hands.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.730
It would be so satisfying

17:54.991 --> 17:59.030
to just slash his tyres
or throw a brick through his window!

17:59.371 --> 18:02.010
To show that you can't
get away with this.

18:02.290 --> 18:06.078
I know you would never resort
to that sort of thing.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.790
Would you, Frasier?

18:12.300 --> 18:15.576
There's a vein
throbbing in your forehead.

18:17.180 --> 18:21.492
I couldn't find it,
but I'll try something else.

18:21.851 --> 18:25.526
Give me the other earring.
Maybe I'll get something.

18:25.855 --> 18:30.212
Oh, yes, I'm getting a feeling.
It's in your father's room.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.718
No, It's in Dr Crane's room.

18:32.987 --> 18:35.979
No... Oh, this is odd.
Now it's in the hallway.

18:38.827 --> 18:40.863
Eddie!

19:06.730 --> 19:11.087
Good evening.
Lovely night, isn't it?

19:12.318 --> 19:14.957
Yes, well, uh... Good night.

19:17.741 --> 19:19.379
(Car horn)

19:23.872 --> 19:26.705
- Get in the car.
- What are you doing here?

19:27.000 --> 19:31.232
- Stopping you from being stupid.
- I know this is wrong,

19:31.588 --> 19:33.499
but it's the only thing left for me!

19:33.757 --> 19:38.672
All right, Frasier. Just give me
the brick and no one will get hurt.

19:39.054 --> 19:42.091
- It's none of your business.
- It is.

19:42.390 --> 19:45.507
- How.
- Remember in school

19:45.810 --> 19:49.086
when somebody took my clothes
while I showered?

19:49.397 --> 19:51.752
They hung them from the goalpost.

19:52.025 --> 19:56.974
I had to get a ladder and climb up there
wearing only a towel, wet and shivering.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.924
Then the towel fell off.

20:01.868 --> 20:06.339
There I was, hanging naked from a
goalpost, and everyone was laughing,

20:06.706 --> 20:11.860
and Coach Medwick just stood there
going... Whatever that means.

20:12.253 --> 20:14.369
Why are you telling me this?

20:14.631 --> 20:17.623
Because I was so humiliated.

20:17.926 --> 20:21.999
I went home, I cried my eyes out.
I swore I would get even.

20:22.347 --> 20:26.101
I was just about to put sugar
into Coach Medwick's gas tank,

20:26.434 --> 20:29.232
and you stopped me.

20:29.521 --> 20:34.470
You said, "lf you act like
a barbarian, you will become one."

20:34.859 --> 20:39.216
I said that?
- Actually, you were more verbose.

20:39.572 --> 20:43.326
I had to listen
while you were sitting on my chest.

20:45.495 --> 20:49.568
- Give me the brick, Frasier.
- And let him get away with this?

20:49.916 --> 20:53.272
What the gallery owner did
was wrong and humiliating.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.656
But if you throw that brick,

20:55.922 --> 20:59.119
you will have lost something
more valuable than your money.

20:59.426 --> 21:04.261
You will have lost...your mind.
You can't do this!

21:07.142 --> 21:11.021
If you could show restraint
after so much humiliation,

21:11.354 --> 21:13.345
not to mention the nicknames...

21:13.606 --> 21:18.236
- Nicknames. There were nicknames?
- You didn't know that?

21:18.611 --> 21:24.083
Dear God. Peachfuzz, Jingle Bells...
I can't remember the rest.

21:24.492 --> 21:28.451
- "Peachfuzz"?
- Coach Medwick made that one up.

21:30.123 --> 21:33.832
Well, anyway, here you are.
I won't be needing this any more.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.581
I'm proud of you.

21:42.427 --> 21:46.420
- What have you done?
- Nobody calls me Peachfuzz!

21:46.765 --> 21:48.721
Now let's get the hell out of here!

21:49.809 --> 21:51.879
What are you doing?

21:52.145 --> 21:55.217
We may be barbarians,
but we pay for our pillaging.

21:56.941 --> 21:59.375
Go! Go! Go! Go!

22:06.076 --> 22:07.953
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling

22:08.203 --> 22:10.592
# Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:10.872 --> 22:11.827
# Oh, my

22:12.999 --> 22:15.433
# Maybe I seem a bit confused

22:15.710 --> 22:17.826
# Yeah, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:20.340 --> 22:21.853
# But I don't know what to do with those

22:22.092 --> 22:25.004
# Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:26.096 --> 22:28.052
# They're calling again

22:30.141 --> 22:32.177
# Scrambled eggs all over my face

22:32.435 --> 22:34.391
# What is a boy to do? #

22:36.690 --> 22:39.284
Frasier has left the building.

22:40.305 --> 22:46.354
