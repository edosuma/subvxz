<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.520 --> 00:05.159
- Marry me.
- But you can't propose to me.

00:05.320 --> 00:07.470
I was gonna propose to you.

00:09.080 --> 00:12.117
If you tell Whitey I have a heart condition,
I'm off the team.

00:12.200 --> 00:15.476
Yeah, and if I don't tell Whitey about
your heart condition, you're off the planet!

00:15.560 --> 00:17.551
<i>If you weren't so busy</i>
<i>trying to see through her shirt,</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:19.915
you would see through her B.S.
She's using you.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.879
Marry me, Haley. Marry me again
in front of all our friends and our family.

00:23.960 --> 00:27.748
- Pete from Fall Out Boy, you showed.
- Didn't anyone think I was gonna show?

00:27.840 --> 00:29.319
Sorry, this cabinet's off-limits.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.595
- What's in there?
- It's just private.

00:31.680 --> 00:33.398
<i>Probably should go</i>
<i>sleep on the couch, though.</i>

00:33.480 --> 00:36.438
<i>Yeah, you should, but you're not going to.</i>

00:37.080 --> 00:38.832
<i>Brooke Davis, are you threatening me?</i>

00:38.920 --> 00:41.275
Let's just say payback's a bitch.

<i>George Eliot once wrote,</i>

Black jerseys for Keith.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.717
First game back. You ready for this?

01:56.800 --> 01:59.268
I think so. Yeah.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.518
The whole team's there for you, man.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.513
I got your back out there tonight.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.032
I can't play tonight.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.872
Dustin! You're in!

03:25.000 --> 03:29.437
Coach, we're in this together.
It's what you taught us, right?

03:37.760 --> 03:40.115
I'm afraid that's a forfeit, Ref.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.791
Okay, the Ravens forfeit.

03:42.960 --> 03:46.919
Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like
the Ravens are gonna forfeit the game.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.149
Ravens forfeit.

04:00.520 --> 04:03.637
You guys didn't have to forfeit the game.
You didn't have to do that for me.

04:03.720 --> 04:06.280
Hey, I told you, got your back.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.268
Thanks.

04:09.440 --> 04:11.635
Look, here's the thing...

04:12.200 --> 04:15.875
All these guys, Luke,
they'd walk through fire for you.

04:17.079 --> 04:19.389
Question is, are you really
gonna make them do that?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.753
Look, remember when I didn't want
to play in this crappy old gym?

04:23.840 --> 04:24.909
You remember what you said to me?

04:26.160 --> 04:27.718
"It's not just about us."

04:27.800 --> 04:29.518
Yeah, and you were right.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.034
I mean, these guys deserve
a shot at State.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.630
And Whitey, it's his last year so...

04:36.080 --> 04:39.550
Look, I'm gonna do everything I can
to help you get through this, but

04:39.640 --> 04:41.358
we can't forfeit the season, Luke.

04:42.960 --> 04:43.949
I know.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.157
Rachel, what's wrong?

04:57.200 --> 04:58.474
What? Who is it?

05:00.360 --> 05:01.509
Someone I used to know.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.228
Someone who's gone now.

05:05.720 --> 05:06.948
Like Jimmy Edwards.

05:14.680 --> 05:15.749
Brooke did this.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.078
What are you doing to Rachel, Brooke?

05:30.600 --> 05:33.034
You know what? After what happened
in here tonight with Lucas,

05:33.120 --> 05:35.634
I think I have a little more on my mind
than your skank-fatuation, Mouth.

05:35.720 --> 05:37.631
It's not fair. She's done nothing to you.

05:37.720 --> 05:40.632
Are you kidding? How about trying to steal
my cheerleading squad?

05:40.720 --> 05:42.950
Or entering me in <i>Rogue Vogue</i>
just so she could screw me over?

05:43.040 --> 05:46.271
Or her midnight round of strip basketball
with my boyfriend?

05:46.360 --> 05:49.397
Or humiliating me
in front of all of my friends last weekend?

05:49.480 --> 05:51.471
You know, stop me any time,
'cause I can go on and on.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.120
The picture.
Rachel said it was someone she knew.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.998
Yeah, fine.

05:57.080 --> 05:58.957
Maybe you should read the back of it.

06:02.440 --> 06:03.953
The flyers. Where else are they?

06:05.360 --> 06:10.150
Well, there's a couple at school,
a few at Tric, Karen's CafÃ©,

06:10.240 --> 06:12.117
numerous convenience stores
around town.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.871
- It's my turn to have a little bit of fun.
- Brooke!

06:16.600 --> 06:18.670
Didn't you learn anything
from Jimmy's death?

06:27.400 --> 06:29.356
You know, now that we're living here,

06:29.440 --> 06:32.398
we should probably
try unpacking at some point.

06:33.360 --> 06:37.478
Yeah, well,
we've been a little busy doing this.

06:39.920 --> 06:42.673
So much better than moving in.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.870
- I can't wait to renew my vows with you.
- Me, too.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.831
I want that second chance, Haley.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.916
I want to give you that wedding
you always dreamed of.

06:53.680 --> 06:54.999
I already had a dream wedding.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.957
No, but you told me how you saw it.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.914
In the church gardens
where your parents got married.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.310
All the bridesmaids and groomsmen,
flowers everywhere.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.075
I want that for you.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.480
Okay, I guess unpacking can wait.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.353
What is that?

07:15.600 --> 07:17.989
- Do you want me to call 911?
- No, no, no.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.351
Just wait there, okay?

07:31.120 --> 07:32.519
So how much for the wall?

07:32.600 --> 07:34.795
I'm guessing it's less
without the creepy clown.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.394
Uncle Cooper.
What are you doing here, man?

07:37.480 --> 07:39.277
It's 1:00 a.m. I'm starving.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.476
- Nathan?
- Who wants breakfast?

07:42.160 --> 07:43.434
It's okay.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.431
- What's going on?
- Come on.

07:52.440 --> 07:53.429
Hello?

07:54.320 --> 07:55.673
Hi, Pete.

07:56.720 --> 08:00.190
God, you're, like, the hardest guy
on the planet to get a hold of.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.792
But I'm glad you called.

08:02.880 --> 08:06.555
Even if it is, what, 1:00 a. M?

08:06.840 --> 08:08.717
Nice. Yeah.

08:09.640 --> 08:12.074
So I didn't freak you out
with all my voice mails?

08:14.040 --> 08:16.679
Well, yeah, I miss you, too.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.360
I don't know, this is...
I mean, this is crazy, right?

08:21.440 --> 08:24.079
I can't even get you on the phone
unless it's the middle of the night.

08:25.640 --> 08:26.755
Okay.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.714
Well, then why don't you tell me
how this is supposed to work?

08:31.480 --> 08:32.958
Right, oh...

08:33.200 --> 08:34.952
Okay, you're outside my window.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.592
You are not outside my window.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.395
Oh.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.749
Oh, my God. All right,

08:47.840 --> 08:50.513
well, just come to the front door,
I'll be down in just a second.

08:50.920 --> 08:53.195
And be quiet. Okay.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.831
Oh, God. Oh, God.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.156
I can't believe you sent him away.

09:15.240 --> 09:18.118
The guy shows up at 1:00 a.m. In a limo,

09:18.200 --> 09:20.839
tattooed from head to toe,
looking for my daughter?

09:20.920 --> 09:23.036
You're lucky all I did was send him away.

09:23.120 --> 09:24.917
Daddy, that was Pete from Fall Out Boy.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.072
Yeah, well now he's Pete from
Get-Out-Of-Town Boy.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.913
I think it's time that we all went over
the ground rules for this house.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.228
By the way, where is Brooke?

09:33.760 --> 09:36.274
- Sleepwalking?
- Yeah, nice try. Grab some bed.

09:37.120 --> 09:40.590
Look, you guys,
let's get a few things straight here.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.796
No boys in this bedroom, ever.

09:43.160 --> 09:46.357
9:00 curfew on weekdays,
midnight on weekends.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.589
If you are out after 10:00,

09:47.680 --> 09:49.875
I need a phone call because
I need to know where you are.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.554
My cell phone will do very nicely,
thank you.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.632
No parties without parental supervision,
no alcohol.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.870
Do I need to go over
the ground rules for sex?

09:57.960 --> 09:58.949
- No!
- No!

09:59.480 --> 10:01.630
Good. Okay, so now,

10:01.920 --> 10:03.876
tell me about Pete from

10:04.160 --> 10:05.195
Fall Out Shelter.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.713
- Fall Out Boy.
- Oh.

10:06.800 --> 10:07.915
Daddy, the lead songwriter

10:08.000 --> 10:09.558
of the number three band
on <i>Billboard</i> charts.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.198
- Grammy-nominated.
- Multi-platinum album seller.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.999
- And very cute.
- Very.

10:16.320 --> 10:19.756
Well, that's all great, but you're telling me
about Pete from Fall Out Boy.

10:19.840 --> 10:23.355
What I really want to know about
is Pete the boy.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.630
There's a difference.
I mean, where'd he grow up?

10:26.720 --> 10:30.508
What kind of family is he from?
Does he hold doors open for you?

10:30.640 --> 10:33.393
Does he say, "God bless you,"
when you sneeze?

10:34.400 --> 10:38.313
Because, Peyton, I don't care
how many albums the guy has sold,

10:38.400 --> 10:41.472
all I care about
is how he's going to treat you.

10:41.560 --> 10:45.678
So let's just agree
that when Pete visits this house,

10:45.760 --> 10:48.877
it will be strictly between business hours.
Got it?

10:50.200 --> 10:52.156
Good. And while we're at it,

10:52.240 --> 10:56.995
Brooke, now that you are living here,
let's just assume

10:57.080 --> 11:00.356
that you're going to find
a new hot-dad fantasy.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.070
All right? Thank you very much.

11:03.160 --> 11:05.230
- Good night, ladies.
- Night.

11:05.440 --> 11:08.000
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

11:15.000 --> 11:16.752
So, it's Haley, right?

11:16.840 --> 11:17.989
I always wanted to meet the girl

11:18.080 --> 11:20.275
who made my nephew crash
a perfectly good racecar.

11:20.360 --> 11:23.113
And I always wanted to meet
the uncle who let Nathan crash a racecar.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.951
She's tough, Nate. I like her.

11:26.040 --> 11:29.157
- You know, your mom's back in town.
- Yeah, she called, actually.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.389
Unlike you, she has the decency

11:30.480 --> 11:32.391
not to storm our apartment
at 1:00 in the morning.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.550
Hey, give me a break.
I was hungry, all right?

11:34.640 --> 11:37.029
Oh, by the way,
I met this smoking-hot girl.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.792
She's 26, she's a model.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.472
You know, my type.

11:40.640 --> 11:43.074
She's home from New York,
she's housesitting for her parents.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.230
I'm telling you, God loves me.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.874
- So, are you staying for a while?
- Absolutely.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.318
If you saw this girl, Nate,
you'd know why, too.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.594
Sorry.

11:54.160 --> 11:58.358
- This does look really good.
- Well, it helps if you're a little buzzed.

12:00.280 --> 12:03.511
So, Nate, listen, I'm sorry about Keith.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.994
- How's Lucas taking it?
- Not good.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.833
He walked off the court tonight.
Actually, we had to forfeit the game.

12:12.640 --> 12:15.074
Well, you know what? He'll... He'll be okay.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.673
Now eat up, it's gonna get cold.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.633
Karen?

12:43.360 --> 12:44.554
Hi.

12:48.640 --> 12:51.279
I'm so sorry I didn't make it back
for Keith's funeral.

12:52.040 --> 12:53.393
I came as soon as I could.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.794
How are you holding up?

13:01.960 --> 13:04.235
Well, the important thing is
to get you back on your feet.

13:05.240 --> 13:08.789
I'm just here to tell you
that I want to help you any way I can.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.029
You've done enough, Deb.

13:11.360 --> 13:14.318
- What do you mean?
- Keith told me that you tried to kill Dan.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.834
It was a terrible mistake.

13:20.040 --> 13:22.429
Not a day goes by
that I don't regret it, Karen.

13:22.520 --> 13:25.512
Yeah, well, my son ran into
a burning building to fix your mistake.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.077
I could have lost him the way I lost Keith.

13:28.640 --> 13:32.235
I'm so sorry that happened.
I had no idea that he was there.

13:33.080 --> 13:36.152
- Thank God Lucas is okay.
- Well, he's not okay, Deb!

13:36.560 --> 13:38.391
None of us are okay.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.916
And as far as I'm concerned,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.833
the only difference
between you and Jimmy Edwards

13:45.280 --> 13:47.669
is that he was successful.

13:57.720 --> 13:58.948
Rachel?

13:59.720 --> 14:02.792
Speak softly, Mouth. I'm a little hung over.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.870
I believe this belongs to you.

14:08.920 --> 14:12.469
It's you, the girl who's gone.
She used to be you.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.872
No. I used to be her.

14:14.960 --> 14:18.714
But I hated myself, so I had some surgery.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.039
Like what?

14:21.440 --> 14:24.557
I had my stomach stapled
and starved myself for months,

14:24.640 --> 14:28.792
and then rewarded myself with a nose job,
fake breasts and a couple other things.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.074
So what?

14:30.280 --> 14:32.555
- I just... I can't believe it.
- Why?

14:32.640 --> 14:35.393
I mean, if I was born like this,
no one would have a problem with it.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.391
And I work hard
to take care of the new me.

14:37.480 --> 14:38.515
I like the new me.

14:39.720 --> 14:40.789
Do you, Rachel?

14:42.200 --> 14:46.113
'Cause other than me, I don't see you
letting too many people into your life.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.034
Don't judge me, Mouth.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.433
You didn't know the old me.

14:50.520 --> 14:53.318
I have self-esteem now
that I've never had before.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.753
And that's great, but

14:55.560 --> 14:57.710
isn't it more about
what kind of person you are?

14:58.280 --> 14:59.759
You know, what's on the inside?

15:00.080 --> 15:02.275
As far as I can tell, that's a bunch of crap.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.717
Come on, tell me something, Mouth.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.588
If you could snap your fingers
and look like Lucas, would you?

15:11.680 --> 15:12.999
I mean, sure you would,

15:13.080 --> 15:14.911
and don't say you wouldn't,
because you'd be lying.

15:16.520 --> 15:19.239
I think if I could snap my fingers
and get something,

15:20.360 --> 15:22.032
it wouldn't be about how I look.

15:23.360 --> 15:24.839
But let's say you're right.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.878
Should everyone who doesn't like
the way they look have surgery?

15:27.960 --> 15:30.838
But, I mean, if they do and it makes them
feel good about themselves,

15:29.400 --> 15:30.594
are you gonna hold that against them?

15:32.360 --> 15:35.955
I mean, look, Mouth,
the choices I made were extreme.

15:34.520 --> 15:39.196
The surgeries were expensive and painful,
and they came with serious risks.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.112
But now, Brooke's gonna out me,

15:44.200 --> 15:46.839
and everyone's gonna look at me
like I'm some kind of Frankenstein.

15:45.880 --> 15:48.030
You don't know that. I don't feel that way.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.794
Really?

15:51.680 --> 15:54.831
I can look at your face and tell
that you already see me differently.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.272
This is who I am now.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.032
This girl's dead.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.197
I thought this game was more exciting.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.115
Coop, I heard you were in town.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.752
How you doing? I knew I'd find you here.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.593
You know, whenever I do my big thinking,

16:32.240 --> 16:34.310
I mostly find myself at an empty racetrack.

16:33.840 --> 16:37.196
- I think the silence clears my head.
- Me, too.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.636
So, when does the circuit
start back up, huh?

16:41.760 --> 16:45.389
For the drivers? Three weeks.
For me, it doesn't.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.394
- I blew my ride.
- What happened?

16:48.400 --> 16:52.029
Well, for one thing, I let my nephew
crash a racecar into the wall,

16:51.040 --> 16:53.190
then things got a little dark from there.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.557
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.436
You know, when they told me
I couldn't drive, I thought my life was over.

16:59.240 --> 17:02.949
Racing was all that I had, you know,
it was who I was.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.318
But then the next day, the sun came up,

17:06.800 --> 17:09.916
the world kept turning,
and I was gonna be okay. You know?

17:08.440 --> 17:12.830
It took me a while, but I finally realized
that even if I never get to race again,

17:12.119 --> 17:13.598
I know I can be happy.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.915
Nathan told me about the game, man.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.279
- I'll get it back.
- I hope you do.

17:23.560 --> 17:26.597
But if for some reason you don't,
you're gonna be okay.

17:26.280 --> 17:29.431
It's not what you do in life
that matters, Luke,

17:32.240 --> 17:34.117
it's about who you are.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.313
- I'm so glad you're happy.
- I am happy.

17:44.760 --> 17:47.399
It is everything that I dreamed it would be.
And I'm...

17:47.520 --> 17:50.080
I'm just so happy
to be renewing my vows with you.

17:50.240 --> 17:53.073
Thank you for this. It's so beautiful.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.796
- There is one catch.
- What?

17:58.760 --> 18:03.072
Well, the church will only allow us
to have the wedding on their grounds

18:01.040 --> 18:03.952
if we agree to take
their pre-marital counseling class,

18:05.440 --> 18:07.795
even though, technically,
we're post-marital.

18:08.440 --> 18:10.351
Okay, well, what is that?

18:10.880 --> 18:14.111
We have to take a test
to see if we're compatible.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.636
And then I guess get some tips
on how not to pull each other's hair out.

18:16.800 --> 18:17.835
Sounds like the basics.

18:20.320 --> 18:24.438
Okay, well, how hard could one test be?
I am Tutor Girl, after all.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.318
Besides, I'll do anything I have to
to marry you again.

18:25.640 --> 18:26.868
All right.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.034
Hey, Pete. I was hoping you'd call.

18:36.720 --> 18:40.599
<i>Actually, it's not.</i>
<i>It's Bill the tour manager. Is this Peyton?</i>

18:39.720 --> 18:40.948
- Yeah.
<i>- Hey, Peyton.</i>

18:43.680 --> 18:46.752
<i>Sorry, I'm using Pete's phone.</i>
<i>I think we met at Tric.</i>

18:45.000 --> 18:47.514
- Oh, right, yeah, hi.
<i>- Hey.</i>

18:48.160 --> 18:50.037
<i>Well, listen,</i>
<i>Pete wanted to call you himself,</i>

18:50.760 --> 18:51.909
<i>but the band's really crazed.</i>

18:52.720 --> 18:53.835
<i>But he really wants to see you,</i>

18:53.960 --> 18:56.030
<i>so he's gonna leave you a plane ticket</i>
<i>at the airport.</i>

18:55.160 --> 18:58.311
- A plane ticket?
<i>- To Chicago, this weekend.</i>

18:57.320 --> 18:59.038
Wow, I mean, that's...

19:01.640 --> 19:04.677
That's really, really nice. Thank you, but

19:03.760 --> 19:07.753
my dad, I mean, he'll freak out
if I tell him I'm flying to Chicago.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.553
<i>Yeah, Pete said you'd say that.</i>
<i>But he said to tell you</i>

19:10.960 --> 19:15.112
<i>you'd really be doing him a favor because</i>
<i>the band thinks you're his Snuffleupagus.</i>

19:13.720 --> 19:15.790
<i>Anyway, if you need anything else,</i>
<i>just call me directly.</i>

19:17.960 --> 19:20.076
<i>Otherwise, we'll have a car</i>
<i>waiting at the airport.</i>

19:20.120 --> 19:21.951
<i>Okay, Peyton,</i>
<i>we'll see you in Chicago, then. Take care.</i>

19:23.200 --> 19:24.189
Okay, thank you.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.678
And can you just tell Pete that I said

19:26.200 --> 19:27.394
that I miss him?

19:31.000 --> 19:34.356
You gonna let an old man stand out here
in the cold, or are you gonna ask me in?

19:36.120 --> 19:37.235
Suit yourself.

19:40.880 --> 19:44.668
Karen, I know what you're going through.
I lost the love of my life, too.

19:46.880 --> 19:50.190
You had Camilla for a lifetime.
I had Keith for a few weeks.

19:50.760 --> 19:51.829
Whose fault was that?

19:54.160 --> 19:57.755
Well, I'm glad to see you're still in there.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.318
Now, you listen to me.

20:07.360 --> 20:11.035
I said that because I know
the guilt that you're carrying around.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.673
And you're wrong to feel it.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.388
Feeling guilty
is not gonna bring Keith back.

20:14.520 --> 20:17.318
Don't I have a right to feel bad?

20:17.080 --> 20:20.277
Did you know Lucas was so broken up
he couldn't play the last game?

20:20.360 --> 20:21.759
No, I didn't think so.

20:25.840 --> 20:26.989
Look, Karen,

20:28.680 --> 20:32.832
you gave Keith the thing
that he loved most in all the world,

20:30.960 --> 20:32.109
Lucas.

20:35.680 --> 20:39.639
He was never happier than when he was
talking about you and that boy.

20:37.680 --> 20:40.353
You gave him a son for a lifetime.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.551
And you let him matter to Lucas.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.358
I know how that feels.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.760
Karen, you couldn't have given him
much more.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.908
Let the guilt fall away.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.319
Let it go.

20:59.160 --> 21:02.436
This test will determine whether
you're really suited for each other.

21:19.160 --> 21:21.435
I know you're both married.
This is just a requirement.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.078
- Okay?
- Okay.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.711
Come on. It'll be fun.

21:31.360 --> 21:32.509
That's the last of them.

21:44.480 --> 21:45.754
Thanks.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.869
You know, when we were together
during the blackout, I loved talking to you.

21:49.120 --> 21:50.712
And it didn't matter that I couldn't see you

21:52.840 --> 21:55.354
because, that night,
it wasn't about your looks.

21:54.520 --> 21:55.953
It was about your heart,

21:57.120 --> 22:00.112
your sense of humor,
the way you saw the world.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.517
I felt like I really knew you.

22:02.160 --> 22:04.549
I actually hated it
when those lights came back on.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.670
But now these flyers
change everything, right?

22:08.440 --> 22:11.477
- I mean, now you don't really know me.
- No. Now I'm sure I know you.

22:10.680 --> 22:13.990
Because when I saw those flyers,
I realized we were more alike than I knew.

22:14.640 --> 22:19.395
And, for a moment, it was like being back
there in the dark again, just the two of us.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.588
I don't see anything ugly
in that picture, Rachel.

22:25.280 --> 22:26.679
Thank you.

22:29.720 --> 22:33.315
But trust me, a lot of people did.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.073
Especially me.

22:35.640 --> 22:39.553
Well, I guess I just want to know
if you ever really let go of her,

22:38.000 --> 22:39.718
the person you used to be.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.551
I mean, when you walk down these halls
do you still feel self-conscious?

22:43.800 --> 22:47.156
Do you hope to be accepted?
Do you worry about fitting in?

22:48.440 --> 22:50.954
'Cause I figure the old you
probably worried about those things.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.389
Yes, Mouth. I still feel that way.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.312
There's not a surgery to fix that yet.

22:58.440 --> 23:00.476
You know,
you're really beautiful now, Rachel.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.353
But I just want you to know,

23:07.080 --> 23:09.150
I could have loved the girl in that picture.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.439
I wish she could have met you.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.474
Coach?

23:41.200 --> 23:45.955
Basketball has always been
a huge part of who I am.

23:46.280 --> 23:47.838
And I've been thinking a lot about it.

23:52.040 --> 23:56.750
But unless somebody can tell me
why this game matters right now,

23:55.320 --> 23:56.673
I don't think I can play.

24:03.080 --> 24:05.355
You know, every time we take this court,

24:14.400 --> 24:18.678
we come in under that old,
faded banner up there,

24:16.760 --> 24:18.591
that says, "Home of the Monarchs."

24:21.400 --> 24:23.709
Anybody know who the Monarchs were?

24:24.160 --> 24:26.754
The Monarchs were
the best basketball team in the state

24:26.560 --> 24:29.711
- back in the '50s.
- Yeah, some people say they were.

24:29.240 --> 24:31.470
They were never in the record books.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.796
Because the Monarchs

24:35.160 --> 24:37.355
were an all-black team.

24:37.680 --> 24:41.673
Back in those days, when I was your age,

24:40.840 --> 24:43.957
blacks and whites weren't allowed
to play this game together.

24:46.040 --> 24:49.316
I was on the best team in the state.

24:50.720 --> 24:52.756
But we all knew there was another one.

24:54.760 --> 24:55.909
The Monarchs.

24:57.440 --> 25:01.194
One night, both teams snuck in here,

24:59.600 --> 25:01.318
locked the door, and squared off.

25:03.440 --> 25:06.796
They were good.
Oh, they were damn good.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.231
We played four games.

25:10.680 --> 25:13.478
They got their shots, we got ours.

25:12.800 --> 25:16.793
And then something magical happened.

25:16.680 --> 25:19.911
Something that none of us
could have anticipated.

25:22.040 --> 25:25.589
Something that had never happened
in this state before.

25:25.720 --> 25:29.076
We decided to mix the teams.

25:31.200 --> 25:34.909
Their captain and our captain
started picking players.

25:35.760 --> 25:39.514
As it turned out,
I was next to the last one picked.

25:40.280 --> 25:42.430
Their captain looked me in the eye

25:44.720 --> 25:47.917
and said, "I'll take Whitey."

25:48.240 --> 25:49.753
And it stuck.

25:52.360 --> 25:54.396
That's how I got my nickname.

25:54.760 --> 25:57.672
Well, that night changed all our lives.

25:59.880 --> 26:03.953
We were no longer black players
or white players.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.870
We were just players.

26:08.160 --> 26:11.596
We shut out the world and played.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.519
Together.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.150
We played a game that we loved.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.678
And that night, that game
changed everything.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.076
I haven't been the same since.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.470
You want me to tell you
that this game matters?

26:27.080 --> 26:30.709
I promise you, son, it does matter.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.915
Let the game heal you, Lucas.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.271
Come back to us, son.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.997
Brooke, are you awake?

26:54.400 --> 26:57.710
Honey, how could I possibly be sleeping
with you thinking so loudly?

26:56.920 --> 26:59.832
- What's the matter, Peyton?
- Pete.

27:05.160 --> 27:08.630
He wants me to fly to Chicago
tomorrow night. He left me a ticket.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.073
Then why are we still talking about this?

27:12.560 --> 27:14.755
If you don't get on that plane,
we are no longer friends.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.310
Brooke, I can't do this again.

27:16.440 --> 27:20.718
Why is it that every guy that I like
always has to leave? It's not fair.

27:18.920 --> 27:21.388
Then you have no choice. You have to go.

27:23.280 --> 27:24.395
Why?

27:25.960 --> 27:30.192
Let's see, because he's cute
and he's a rock star, and you love music.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.678
And he's nice to you.
And if you go, you'll have a great time

27:32.200 --> 27:34.589
and maybe you'll fall in love,
and if you don't,

27:35.080 --> 27:38.516
you're gonna look back on this in 20 years
and wonder, "What if?"

27:37.560 --> 27:38.959
I already have my what ifs.

27:41.200 --> 27:43.589
Well, maybe this time
you can have something more.

27:43.400 --> 27:47.473
I'm sorry, I don't quite know
how to tell you this, but you failed.

27:57.480 --> 27:59.152
- You're kidding.
- I'm sorry, no.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.553
According to the test,
the two of you are highly incompatible.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.676
I've never actually failed a test before.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.558
Father, can I ask you a question?

28:14.600 --> 28:16.511
When you decided
you wanted to be a priest,

28:17.480 --> 28:18.833
how did you know
it was the right thing to do?

28:19.480 --> 28:21.038
I had a devout belief in God.

28:22.320 --> 28:25.995
Can you prove that to us?
With some sort of a test, I mean?

28:24.680 --> 28:26.033
Of course not.

28:29.560 --> 28:31.869
Just like you can't prove love with a test.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.634
I mean, this is just a score
on a sheet of paper.

28:34.120 --> 28:37.351
Sure, Haley and I have our differences,
but this test doesn't show

28:37.160 --> 28:39.594
how hard we've worked
to keep this relationship together.

28:40.480 --> 28:43.597
Or that I can't stand it when we're apart.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.915
Or that every time I look at her,

28:47.880 --> 28:50.394
I know that I'm going to be with her
for the rest of my life.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.751
We love each other, Father.

28:56.320 --> 28:57.799
No test is gonna show that.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.438
Let me see that test.

29:04.120 --> 29:08.671
Thanks for passing the real test.
I'm sure we'll have a wonderful ceremony.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.235
Thank you.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.592
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

29:15.960 --> 29:17.712
Thank you.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.070
- Hey, Lucas.
- Hey.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.830
Deb, it's so good to see you.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.470
Are you sure you can handle all this?

29:28.920 --> 29:30.114
Karen's my partner,

29:31.840 --> 29:34.718
and God knows she's picked up
the slack for me a time or two.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.155
It's the least I could do.

29:36.080 --> 29:40.278
But to be honest, it'll be a full-blown
miracle if the register balances.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.478
Thanks for helping my mom out.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.069
It means a lot.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.997
So how is it being back,

29:52.000 --> 29:53.991
with Dan and all?

29:54.120 --> 29:57.510
Well, Cooper is staying with me.
It feels safe to have family around.

29:56.960 --> 29:59.758
And so far,
Dan is keeping his distance, so...

30:00.440 --> 30:01.555
It'll be okay.

30:04.360 --> 30:05.349
You know,

30:08.880 --> 30:13.431
when Nathan wrecked that car,
I didn't speak to Cooper for months.

30:10.360 --> 30:15.115
I mean, I knew it wasn't really his fault,
but somehow I blamed him anyway.

30:15.520 --> 30:18.717
Losing your child
is every mother's biggest fear.

30:23.760 --> 30:26.035
Nothing even comes close.

30:27.040 --> 30:28.109
For your mom to get better,

30:30.800 --> 30:32.791
she's really gonna have to
lean on you, Lucas.

30:31.960 --> 30:35.157
So, whatever you do,
just make sure to take care of yourself.

30:34.440 --> 30:35.714
You have to,

30:38.960 --> 30:40.154
for your mother's sake.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.268
We're gonna be set up here,

30:50.600 --> 30:52.955
and you're gonna have to start out
pressing these guys real hard.

30:51.920 --> 30:54.388
So, you're gonna have Daniels
starting opposite...

30:54.360 --> 30:57.397
- Coach, you got a sec?
- Oh, yeah, sit down.

30:56.920 --> 30:58.273
You need to hear this, too, Nate.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.229
I can't play tonight.

31:08.560 --> 31:09.788
I have a heart condition.

31:13.040 --> 31:14.155
I have HCM,

31:17.800 --> 31:21.270
and I haven't been taking my medication,
so that I wouldn't slow down my game.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.515
And if I play, I could die.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.238
I know how selfish I've been.

31:31.920 --> 31:33.911
I just didn't want to
leave the game behind.

31:34.680 --> 31:37.672
Because the game did change my life.

31:38.600 --> 31:39.828
Just like yours.

31:42.880 --> 31:47.431
And it's gonna be hard to let it go.

31:45.800 --> 31:48.872
The game can only change you
if you have a life to change, right?

31:55.080 --> 31:58.755
I know how hard
this conversation must be for you, Lucas.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.115
No.

32:02.760 --> 32:05.149
The next conversation I have
is gonna be the hard one.

32:05.360 --> 32:06.793
Nice picture.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.478
When are you going to get over
Jabba the Slut

33:31.640 --> 33:32.993
so we can go back to being friends?

33:33.280 --> 33:35.555
You know, Brooke,
you got Rachel all wrong.

33:34.720 --> 33:36.073
She's not a bad person.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.878
And what you're doing to her is cruel.

33:38.520 --> 33:41.273
But I'm not. You know me, Mouth.

33:41.400 --> 33:42.958
And as scrumptious as it sounds,

33:44.240 --> 33:46.993
I could never go through
with Operation Fat Rachel.

33:45.880 --> 33:48.553
- I'm just playing around.
- Well, that's good, Brooke.

33:48.880 --> 33:51.348
Because you better get used to Rachel
being around.

33:51.640 --> 33:54.438
She's a great person,
and deep down she has a big heart.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.794
I like her. A lot.

33:58.400 --> 34:02.712
Look, I know she says she's into you,
but just please be careful.

34:02.120 --> 34:04.395
You know a leopard
doesn't change its spots.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.717
Actually, she did change her spots.

34:10.440 --> 34:11.953
I just hope her heart's the same.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.234
Hey.

34:25.080 --> 34:28.550
I hope I didn't completely freak out
Fall Out Boy.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.275
Have you heard from him?

34:31.320 --> 34:34.072
- Maybe.
- Oh, a woman of mystery.

34:33.960 --> 34:36.554
Must've gotten that from your mother.
You didn't get it from me.

34:38.560 --> 34:41.677
- You know I trust you, right?
- Yeah.

34:45.159 --> 34:46.639
Good.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.513
Just promise me one thing.

34:55.239 --> 34:59.119
Promise me that when you pick
the boy you're really gonna be with

34:57.680 --> 35:02.310
that he'll be someone who respects you
and treats you well.

35:01.920 --> 35:05.310
And it's someone
who makes your heart race.

35:08.160 --> 35:10.674
And that he's someone who you love

35:12.040 --> 35:15.032
because of what he is, not what he does.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.995
Because that's how I felt
about your mother,

35:23.800 --> 35:26.792
and that's how I want you to feel one day.

35:27.320 --> 35:28.435
Use your head

35:34.120 --> 35:35.235
and follow your heart.

35:37.040 --> 35:40.237
46 points? That's like really good, isn't it?

36:04.600 --> 36:06.192
It's not bad.

36:07.880 --> 36:10.440
- Well, you were amazing.
- Thank you.

36:09.640 --> 36:10.914
Where was Luke tonight?

36:12.280 --> 36:14.999
Lucas has a heart condition, Hales.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.718
Don't be mad at me,
I kind of already knew about his HCM.

36:20.880 --> 36:23.678
He made me promise
not to tell anybody. Sorry.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.638
- Isn't he taking his medication?
- No.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.713
Great, so he lied to me.

36:30.320 --> 36:33.437
Well, I think he lied to everyone,
including himself.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.990
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

36:35.480 --> 36:37.948
We're all gonna make sure he's okay.
I promise.

36:38.040 --> 36:40.315
Thank you for being such an amazing guy.

36:42.440 --> 36:45.238
And thank you for having the right answer
with that priest the other day.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.553
God, for a minute there I thought
we weren't gonna get our big wedding.

36:47.680 --> 36:50.114
You know, we don't still have to do that
if you don't want to.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.468
No. I really want to.

36:53.760 --> 36:57.673
I've just been trying to think of
a way to make the day really memorable

36:55.080 --> 36:57.469
and I had an idea.

36:59.080 --> 37:00.354
You ready?

37:01.560 --> 37:02.959
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:02.920 --> 37:05.753
What if we don't have sex
until we get married again?

37:05.200 --> 37:08.237
- Do you still love me?
- What, are you kidding?

37:10.760 --> 37:12.193
Yeah, okay.

37:19.200 --> 37:22.795
But does that mean
that I can't still kiss you like this?

37:20.760 --> 37:21.749
No.

37:25.360 --> 37:27.191
Or like this?

37:26.840 --> 37:29.593
Okay, maybe we'll just start
on the no-sex thing tomorrow night.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.272
You know, that's fine.

37:32.520 --> 37:33.748
Mom?

37:42.080 --> 37:46.119
I know that you're hurting
now more than ever,

37:45.080 --> 37:46.832
and I don't want to make that worse,

37:50.520 --> 37:52.078
but I need to tell you something.

37:53.760 --> 37:56.638
I lied to you about my heart condition.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.397
I have HCM.

38:12.880 --> 38:16.759
I need you.
I need you now more than ever.

38:17.600 --> 38:18.953
Mouth?

38:40.720 --> 38:42.312
What are you doing here?

38:43.240 --> 38:46.437
You said that you wished
the girl in that picture had met me.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.592
I just thought maybe she still might have...

38:48.240 --> 38:49.468
Hey, babe, what are you doing?

38:50.000 --> 38:51.831
You got flowers. Who are they from?

38:52.280 --> 38:54.874
They're... They're from you.

38:56.320 --> 38:57.878
I'm gonna need a lot of help.

39:35.880 --> 39:38.474
Good. 'Cause you're gonna get it.

39:39.280 --> 39:40.508
