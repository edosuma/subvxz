03:00.914 --> 03:03.616
- He's
waiting for his date.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.685
It's March 7th.

03:05.718 --> 03:08.988
I saw the calendar
on the wall earlier.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.558
Did she stand him up?

03:11.591 --> 03:13.459
I bet she did.

03:13.493 --> 03:16.496
The lonely fuck
can't catch a break.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.040
- It's nice to see you.

03:27.073 --> 03:28.274
- It's nice to see you too.

03:30.310 --> 03:30.910
- Wine?

03:30.944 --> 03:32.045
- Yes.

03:32.078 --> 03:35.582
Yes, after a long day of
work that sounds wonderful.

03:51.631 --> 03:53.466
So how was your day?

03:53.499 --> 03:55.335
- My day was good.

03:55.368 --> 03:56.669
How was your day?

03:56.703 --> 03:57.804
- Good.

03:57.837 --> 03:58.871
Pretty typical.

04:02.875 --> 04:05.011
So tell me something
about yourself.

04:05.044 --> 04:07.347
- Let's try something different.

04:07.380 --> 04:10.016
Instead of me telling
you all about myself

04:10.049 --> 04:12.852
and my statistics, like the
back of a fucking baseball card,

04:14.354 --> 04:17.390
let's talk about
whatever comes to mind.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.057
You know?

04:19.058 --> 04:20.692
Whatever we want.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.697
Something a bit more organic.

04:24.731 --> 04:26.799
- Like a dating experiment?

04:29.135 --> 04:31.437
- Think of it more as defiance

04:31.471 --> 04:35.008
from the typical first
date conversation.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.110
I don't wanna know
where you work

04:37.143 --> 04:39.579
or where you went to college.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.116
I want to know the real you.

04:45.385 --> 04:46.853
- Ready to order?

04:46.886 --> 04:48.087
- We might need a
couple more minutes.

04:48.121 --> 04:48.921
- Oh, I'm ready.

04:48.955 --> 04:49.856
- Yeah, sure.

04:49.889 --> 04:51.391
- I'll have the chicken parm.

04:51.424 --> 04:52.625
Extra cheese.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.527
- I'll have the
chicken parm too.

04:54.560 --> 04:55.495
- Extra cheese?

04:55.528 --> 04:57.030
- No, thanks.

04:57.063 --> 04:59.032
- Anything
else to drink?

04:59.065 --> 05:00.400
- I'm good with wine.

05:00.433 --> 05:01.601
- Me too.

05:01.634 --> 05:02.702
- Great, I'll bring
you some bread.

05:02.735 --> 05:03.736
- Thank you.

05:04.671 --> 05:05.672
- Thank you.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.510
- Okay, so where were we?

05:10.543 --> 05:11.678
- What do you think
of everything?

05:11.711 --> 05:13.112
- What?

05:13.146 --> 05:15.448
- Look, I know this whole
first date game is kinda weird,

05:15.481 --> 05:16.983
but give it a try.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.485
Worst case scenario,

05:19.519 --> 05:21.988
you have a funny story
to tell your friends.

05:22.021 --> 05:22.655
- Okay.

05:24.457 --> 05:25.692
What do you mean, everything?

05:25.725 --> 05:27.694
- I mean everything.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.395
Life, work, culture.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.700
The shit hole we live in.

05:33.733 --> 05:35.668
What's the point of everything?

05:35.702 --> 05:37.570
- That's a pretty
vague question.

05:37.603 --> 05:38.438
Fine.

05:41.140 --> 05:44.043
I guess you just gotta
do your best, you know?

05:44.077 --> 05:46.679
Try your hardest and
push for what you want.

05:46.713 --> 05:47.547
- Mhmm.

05:50.717 --> 05:51.784
I'm sorry.

05:51.818 --> 05:53.086
Was that really your answer?

05:53.119 --> 05:53.920
- Yeah.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.988
- That was stupid.

05:56.022 --> 06:00.727
Look, I'm not asking you to
write me a graduation speech.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.563
I'm asking you to tell
me how you really feel.

06:03.596 --> 06:04.797
Take off that clown mask

06:04.831 --> 06:07.467
that you have to wear
for everybody else.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.501
Give me you.

06:10.136 --> 06:10.970
- Okay.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.874
Everything's bullshit.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.444
I think everything
is fucking bullshit.

06:18.478 --> 06:20.179
I'll tell you why.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.116
I don't know you and
you don't know me

06:23.149 --> 06:25.585
but we got one thing in common.

06:25.618 --> 06:26.452
Struggle.

06:27.820 --> 06:32.125
We struggle our whole
goddamn lives and for what?

06:32.158 --> 06:35.228
I work a shitty job
so I can merely live.

06:35.261 --> 06:38.231
Literally so I can eat,
have a bed to sleep on

06:38.264 --> 06:42.235
and continue with my
worthless existence.

06:42.268 --> 06:43.503
We live to die.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.838
Just killing time.

06:46.973 --> 06:49.609
We wake up everyday
and go to work.

06:49.642 --> 06:52.845
What the fuck are we
working towards, exactly?

06:52.879 --> 06:56.082
Working so we can go
home and watch TV?

06:56.115 --> 06:59.919
Working so I can buy food
to stuff my face with?

06:59.952 --> 07:02.088
Work so I can retire
one day when I'm senile?

07:02.121 --> 07:05.491
I'm not gonna
remember shit anyway.

07:05.525 --> 07:08.461
Life is just the
act of struggling.

07:09.529 --> 07:12.131
At least for the most of us.

07:13.733 --> 07:16.169
- Now that's a fucking answer.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.045
- They
talk for awhile.

07:26.078 --> 07:28.514
I'm surprised how comfortable
she seems with him.

07:28.548 --> 07:30.183
Just like she gets him.

07:30.216 --> 07:33.052
No one ever gets
him, not even me.

07:33.085 --> 07:35.154
Somehow, she does.

07:35.188 --> 07:38.124
For two hours
straight, they talk.

07:38.157 --> 07:40.293
He doesn't ask her
about his past,

07:40.326 --> 07:42.795
she doesn't ask
him about her job.

07:42.829 --> 07:45.865
But their conversation is somehow
compelling and beautiful.

07:45.898 --> 07:47.533
Like an effortless poem

07:47.567 --> 07:51.637
in which they take turns
contributing, line from line.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.539
"God is dead."

07:53.573 --> 07:55.274
"God isn't dead.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.243
"Sex is God."

07:57.276 --> 08:00.079
"Who are we but animals
trapped behind a wall?"

08:00.112 --> 08:03.216
- What is a wall but a pediment
to the human condition?

08:03.249 --> 08:04.584
- Only the imagination
could break--

08:04.617 --> 08:05.918
- That down.

08:08.588 --> 08:11.057
I'm going to the bathroom.

08:11.090 --> 08:12.258
- I'll grab the check.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.560
- I can split it with
you, if you want.

08:14.594 --> 08:15.561
- Don't be silly.

08:15.595 --> 08:18.264
You said you're unemployed.
Save your money.

08:18.297 --> 08:20.299
- You're too sweet.

08:47.293 --> 08:48.127
I'm back.

08:52.265 --> 08:55.668
- So you wanna come over
for some coffee or a drink?

08:55.701 --> 08:56.769
- Yeah, sure.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.405
- Sorry, this place is a mess.

09:32.438 --> 09:35.007
- Oh it's okay, I don't care.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.691
I like your place.

09:51.724 --> 09:52.725
- Thank you.

10:38.404 --> 10:39.438
Hey.

10:40.506 --> 10:41.440
Hey!

10:41.474 --> 10:42.908
- Huh?

10:42.942 --> 10:44.143
- You want me to
make you a drink?

10:44.176 --> 10:45.311
- Oh, yeah.

10:45.344 --> 10:47.179
Yeah, that'd be great.

12:46.932 --> 12:47.533
- Where are you going?

12:47.566 --> 12:48.868
- I gotta go.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.471
- It's 3:30 in the morning.

12:52.505 --> 12:53.506
- I'm sorry.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.343
- You can't be serious.

12:57.376 --> 12:58.177
Spend the night.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.578
- No, I've gotta go.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.546
- What's wrong?

13:00.579 --> 13:02.948
- Just leave me the fuck alone!

15:54.620 --> 15:56.255
- Are you fucking kidding me?

15:56.288 --> 15:58.691
Tell me this is a joke.

15:58.724 --> 15:59.558
- I'm sorry.

15:59.591 --> 16:01.760
- You're late five
times this month.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.495
Do you wanna get fired?

16:03.529 --> 16:07.333
Because I'm pretty fucking
sure you wanna get fired.

16:07.366 --> 16:09.168
- I apologize.

16:09.201 --> 16:10.369
- You're lazy.

16:12.404 --> 16:14.273
- I'm sorry, it
won't happen again.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.607
- You're damn right it won't.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.677
If it does, I'll
fire you on the spot.

16:37.396 --> 16:38.230
- Hello?

16:39.732 --> 16:40.766
Hey.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.069
I'm glad you called.

16:44.103 --> 16:45.104
How are you?

16:48.374 --> 16:49.641
I'm good.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.410
I'm just hanging out.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.815
Sure, you can come over, yeah.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.488
If a bottle of tequila counts.

17:06.157 --> 17:07.659
Okay.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.094
Okay, cool, cool.

17:10.496 --> 17:11.797
I'll see you soon?

17:14.665 --> 17:15.501
Bye.

17:32.451 --> 17:33.252
Hey.

17:33.285 --> 17:33.886
- What's up?

17:33.919 --> 17:35.154
- Come in.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.830
It's nice to see you.

17:44.863 --> 17:47.800
- It's nice to see you too.

17:47.833 --> 17:49.601
- So what do you wanna do?

17:49.635 --> 17:50.469
- Drink.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.174
And hang out.

17:56.775 --> 17:58.911
- I'll get the bottle.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.145
- Grab it...

18:01.947 --> 18:03.182
and...

18:05.184 --> 18:07.853
meet me in your bedroom.

18:07.886 --> 18:08.887
- All right.

18:27.406 --> 18:28.340
Hey, hey, hey.

18:28.373 --> 18:29.475
Are you okay?

18:31.310 --> 18:32.311
- I'm sorry.

18:33.979 --> 18:36.815
I'm so fucked up in the head.

18:36.849 --> 18:37.883
It's all--

18:39.251 --> 18:41.854
- Fucked up in the head?

18:51.230 --> 18:52.164
- I just...

18:53.899 --> 18:55.234
I feel so empty.

19:00.739 --> 19:01.907
You know, like,

19:02.875 --> 19:06.245
I'm either really
sad or really happy.

19:12.618 --> 19:14.953
It's never a steady balance.

19:20.025 --> 19:21.994
- I'm rarely happy, so,

19:22.027 --> 19:26.665
I'm not the right person
to be giving advice.

19:26.698 --> 19:28.934
- Why are you rarely happy?

19:30.802 --> 19:32.237
- I don't know, just forget it.

19:32.271 --> 19:32.871
- No, tell me.

19:32.905 --> 19:33.972
- No.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.909
- Oh my god, will
you just tell me?

19:39.478 --> 19:43.649
- I just don't have many
things to be happy about.

19:45.284 --> 19:45.918
- Well,

19:46.919 --> 19:49.621
what do you do for work?

19:49.655 --> 19:51.356
- So now we're
gonna ask questions?

19:51.390 --> 19:53.425
- I can ask questions.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.527
- That doesn't seem fair.

20:03.635 --> 20:04.469
- Tell me.

20:06.672 --> 20:08.006
- I work in an office.

20:10.509 --> 20:11.910
- Cool.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.512
- Yeah, it's great.

20:14.413 --> 20:16.281
- You don't like it.

20:16.915 --> 20:19.484
- No, I don't like it.

20:19.518 --> 20:23.822
I just do the same
fucking thing every day.

20:23.855 --> 20:26.959
It's like an assembly like
at a factory or something.

20:26.992 --> 20:28.894
- Then why do you do it?

20:28.927 --> 20:31.296
- Because it's my passion.

20:32.030 --> 20:35.534
Why does anybody do what
they don't wanna do?

20:35.567 --> 20:38.737
It's a job, you know, I have to.

20:38.770 --> 20:39.605
- Well,

20:40.772 --> 20:43.041
what do you wanna do?

20:43.075 --> 20:44.776
- That's the problem.

20:44.810 --> 20:48.280
There's nothing that
I really wanna do.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.282
- Come here.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.815
Tell me something about you.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.919
- Like what?

22:02.988 --> 22:04.423
- I don't know.

22:07.025 --> 22:09.428
Tell me about your childhood.

22:11.163 --> 22:14.366
- It was a pretty
regular childhood.

22:16.568 --> 22:17.836
- Your parents?

22:20.839 --> 22:23.508
- My mom died when I was a baby.

22:24.209 --> 22:27.012
So my dad took care of me

22:27.045 --> 22:28.113
and my uncle.

22:30.048 --> 22:32.184
- Are they still alive?

22:32.217 --> 22:33.085
- No.

22:33.118 --> 22:34.152
- Oh.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.589
My parents are still alive

22:37.622 --> 22:40.959
but I haven't talked
to them in 10 years.

22:40.992 --> 22:43.829
We had a pretty big falling out.

22:43.862 --> 22:44.963
- I'm sorry.

22:44.996 --> 22:45.931
- Don't be.

22:48.133 --> 22:49.167
I'm sorry.

22:50.135 --> 22:51.136
- It's okay.

22:58.977 --> 23:00.545
The solar system,

23:00.579 --> 23:03.148
and there are
certain similarities.

23:05.917 --> 23:08.086
- He was around seven

23:08.120 --> 23:11.523
when he started being
babysat by his uncle,

23:11.556 --> 23:15.827
the alcoholic who was
in and out of prison.

23:38.617 --> 23:42.220
He would take him into the
closet where it was dark,

23:42.254 --> 23:45.257
so I wouldn't be present
to know what happened.

23:45.290 --> 23:48.126
As soon as he would
come out into the light,

23:48.160 --> 23:52.697
I'd be there, watching the
tears go down his cheek,

23:52.731 --> 23:54.900
hearing the whimpers
come out of his mouth

23:54.933 --> 23:58.970
and shake with him from what
happened in that closet.

23:59.004 --> 24:00.272
He was forced into that closet

24:00.305 --> 24:03.675
every time he was
babysat by his uncle.

24:03.708 --> 24:06.111
Until one day his uncle died.

24:07.679 --> 24:08.513
He was 10.

24:09.848 --> 24:12.851
He didn't have to whimper
or cry after that.

24:12.884 --> 24:14.553
But he still shakes.

24:15.320 --> 24:16.688
We both shake.

24:31.937 --> 24:33.205
- Hey,

24:33.238 --> 24:34.306
I have to go to work.

24:54.259 --> 24:57.963
- Well look who showed
up to work on time.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.081
- What
does the note say?

26:25.317 --> 26:27.352
I wish I could...

26:27.385 --> 26:29.254
Is he looking at me?

26:30.722 --> 26:31.957
Can he hear me?

26:33.325 --> 26:35.160
Do you fucking see me?

27:00.251 --> 27:01.353
- Are you done?

27:01.386 --> 27:03.188
- Yep.

27:03.221 --> 27:07.692
- Well then clear your
plate and do the dishes.

27:12.831 --> 27:14.432
Did you break a plate?!

28:05.550 --> 28:06.785
- Babe?

28:10.789 --> 28:11.823
Babe, you home?

28:26.304 --> 28:27.906
Babe, what's wrong?

28:30.542 --> 28:32.043
Why're you crying?

28:35.380 --> 28:37.982
- I just stopped feeling right.

28:39.150 --> 28:41.419
- It's okay, it's
okay, it's okay.

28:50.462 --> 28:51.763
- I'm broken.

28:52.831 --> 28:55.300
Like an old toy or something.

28:55.333 --> 28:56.768
I can't be fixed.

28:57.535 --> 28:59.237
Do you understand?

29:01.372 --> 29:04.542
- People like us can't be fixed.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.977
Do you know what one broken toy

29:06.010 --> 29:08.880
and another broken toy equals?

29:08.913 --> 29:11.549
One normal toy,
one normal person.

29:16.020 --> 29:16.855
- No.

29:19.891 --> 29:23.394
You'll just have
two broken toys.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.330
- That's one's opinion.

29:27.298 --> 29:28.867
- Do you ever think

29:33.538 --> 29:37.308
that sometimes the
breathless breathe easier?

29:55.426 --> 29:56.528
Remember our first date,

29:56.561 --> 29:59.964
when I asked you what you
thought about everything?

29:59.998 --> 30:01.332
- Yeah.

30:02.367 --> 30:03.568
- You were right.

30:05.236 --> 30:06.538
It's all bullshit.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.408
Everything is bullshit.

30:11.576 --> 30:14.512
What's the point
of the struggle?

30:15.914 --> 30:18.183
- There's some point to it.

30:18.216 --> 30:19.384
- What's that?

30:20.552 --> 30:22.887
- The light.

30:22.921 --> 30:25.290
We have it the
rest of our lives.

30:26.925 --> 30:28.426
- There is no hope for us.

30:28.459 --> 30:30.628
- Of course there is.

30:30.662 --> 30:31.896
I met you.

30:32.630 --> 30:35.066
- I add to your misery.

30:35.099 --> 30:37.335
- No you don't.

30:37.368 --> 30:41.072
You are the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

30:47.378 --> 30:48.580
- Do you love me?

30:52.617 --> 30:53.918
I love you.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.221
- I love you too.

30:56.254 --> 30:57.522
- You don't have to say it back.

30:57.555 --> 31:00.158
- I don't have to say
it back but I mean it.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.025
I do.

31:02.493 --> 31:03.328
- Good.

31:18.710 --> 31:19.510
Hey.

31:19.544 --> 31:20.378
- Huh?

31:22.614 --> 31:25.083
- Do you miss your parents?

31:27.418 --> 31:28.419
- Sometimes.

31:34.225 --> 31:36.694
- I bet they really loved you.

31:39.163 --> 31:41.633
I bet they'd be so proud of you.

31:43.735 --> 31:48.973
Wish they could've seen
the person you've become.

31:49.007 --> 31:51.643
Do you think they'd
recognize you?

31:53.111 --> 31:55.046
I wonder if they would.

31:57.015 --> 31:57.649
I wonder.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.441
- Again?

32:24.642 --> 32:25.576
- What do you mean, again?

32:25.610 --> 32:27.745
- I mean, you said you
would take a break.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.447
- It's not like I
drank the whole bottle.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.648
- Well congratulations
for not drinking

32:30.682 --> 32:32.750
the whole fucking bottle!

32:37.088 --> 32:40.325
- I don't have to
explain myself to you!

32:40.358 --> 32:42.260
- You're an alcoholic!

32:42.293 --> 32:44.262
Is that what you wanna be?

32:44.295 --> 32:45.530
Huh?

32:45.563 --> 32:47.398
A lowlife who just
drinks and fucks?

32:49.801 --> 32:51.135
- Get off of me!

32:56.674 --> 32:58.743
Look what you did!

33:01.779 --> 33:04.082
Look at what the fuck you did!

33:04.115 --> 33:06.184
- I didn't do that, all right?

33:06.217 --> 33:08.553
You were drunk and you fell.

33:09.520 --> 33:10.321
- Get off!

33:12.357 --> 33:13.758
- Get away from me!

33:15.093 --> 33:15.927
- Do you want me to cut you?

33:15.960 --> 33:18.663
- Christine, don't
you fucking dare!

33:32.143 --> 33:32.777
Hello?

33:36.247 --> 33:37.081
Hello?

33:39.384 --> 33:41.319
Christine, is that you?

33:48.893 --> 33:50.728
- This man.

33:51.596 --> 33:54.098
This poor, sick, insane man.

33:57.602 --> 34:02.206
I think he loved her more
than anything in the world.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.242
She is a miracle to him.

34:05.743 --> 34:09.746
His freedom from the
tragedy, which is his life.

34:10.815 --> 34:14.318
He was her freedom
from the mundane,

34:14.351 --> 34:15.853
from the lifeless,

34:16.788 --> 34:20.291
from the abysm she
had been in for years.

34:21.359 --> 34:23.694
They found each other

34:23.728 --> 34:26.330
and with that, lost themselves.

34:27.764 --> 34:29.900
Do you love me?

34:45.449 --> 34:46.751
- Darwin Barnes?

34:46.784 --> 34:47.885
- Yeah?

34:47.918 --> 34:48.886
- You're under
arrest for the murder

34:48.920 --> 34:50.788
of Christine Meredith Thompson.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.690
You have the right
to remain silent.

34:52.723 --> 34:53.524
- What?

34:53.558 --> 34:54.759
- Anything you say--

34:54.792 --> 34:56.627
- What do you mean,
Christine is dead?

34:56.661 --> 34:57.862
Are you listening to me?

34:57.895 --> 34:58.796
- You have a right
to an attorney.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.364
- What the fuck is going on?!

35:00.398 --> 35:01.599
- If you can't
afford an attorney,

35:01.632 --> 35:04.735
one will be appointed
to you by the state.

35:45.276 --> 35:46.611
- Hello, Darwin.

35:48.646 --> 35:51.315
I'm John Crowley, one
of the lead detectives.

35:51.349 --> 35:52.917
- Is Christine all right?

35:52.950 --> 35:54.218
- She's dead.

36:07.498 --> 36:10.935
Why don't we talk
about how she died?

36:13.004 --> 36:14.238
Darwin?

36:16.274 --> 36:16.908
Darwin?

36:18.276 --> 36:19.410
- What?

36:19.443 --> 36:21.946
- Just talk to me.

36:21.979 --> 36:23.848
How did she die?

36:23.881 --> 36:24.882
- I don't know.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.217
I don't know.

36:27.652 --> 36:31.255
- She was found like
his next to a dumpster.

36:31.289 --> 36:35.026
The murder weapon was with
her and it was a steak knife.

36:35.059 --> 36:37.261
- She was found
with a steak knife?

36:37.295 --> 36:38.696
- That's right.

36:38.729 --> 36:42.767
Your blood was found stained
on the apartment rug.

36:44.702 --> 36:48.406
You guys have a fight
that turned physical?

36:48.439 --> 36:51.375
- No, I couldn't
have been my blood.

36:51.409 --> 36:52.510
It had to be her blood.

36:52.543 --> 36:55.012
She was drunk and she fell.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.615
- That was two nights ago.

36:57.648 --> 36:59.383
What about you?

36:59.417 --> 37:01.052
Were you drunk?

37:01.085 --> 37:02.286
- No.

37:03.487 --> 37:05.256
Not during the fight,

37:06.424 --> 37:08.759
but after she stormed
out, I started drinking.

37:08.793 --> 37:11.562
- That fight
involved this knife.

37:20.004 --> 37:22.907
So you recognize the knife?

37:22.940 --> 37:26.744
- She grabbed it when we
were having a fight, yeah.

37:26.777 --> 37:30.982
- So she felt she needed
it for protection form you.

37:31.015 --> 37:33.784
- No, she was drunk, all right?

37:35.453 --> 37:36.954
It sounds more
dramatic than it was.

37:36.988 --> 37:41.993
- We have a neighbor saying
that she yelled out and I quote,

37:43.060 --> 37:43.961
"Get the fuck away from me."

37:43.995 --> 37:45.696
- No, that's what I said.

37:45.730 --> 37:46.864
- Oh, that's what you said.

37:46.897 --> 37:49.033
- Yes, she was belligerently
drunk and she had a knife.

37:49.066 --> 37:52.336
I yelled for her to
get away from me.

37:53.771 --> 37:56.507
- Let's start from
the beginning.

37:57.908 --> 38:00.978
Can you explain how your
relationship with her began?

38:04.815 --> 38:06.083
Darwin?

38:07.918 --> 38:09.053
Darwin, come on.

38:11.789 --> 38:14.392
Let's start at the beginning.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.828
- I met her at
the grocery store.

38:19.563 --> 38:23.968
She was looking at the cereal
and she asked for help.

38:25.169 --> 38:28.606
She couldn't reach the
Cheerios on the top shelf.

38:34.045 --> 38:36.747
We just kinda started talking.

38:39.417 --> 38:41.052
We had a lot of
things in common.

38:41.085 --> 38:42.386
She was broken, like me.

38:42.420 --> 38:43.754
- Broken?

38:43.788 --> 38:47.725
- Once you're broken
you can't be fixed.

38:47.758 --> 38:50.594
People like us,
we can't be fixed.

38:51.762 --> 38:54.465
We just live our
lives until we die

38:54.498 --> 38:58.169
and then we can finally
feel some relief.

38:58.202 --> 38:59.737
We can finally breathe.

38:59.770 --> 39:03.441
- What do you know
about her past, Darwin?

39:03.474 --> 39:05.176
Did she tell you anything?

39:05.209 --> 39:07.445
- No, not really.

39:07.478 --> 39:10.681
She said it was fucked up but
she don't wanna talk about it.

39:10.715 --> 39:14.018
- She didn't tell you anything.

39:14.051 --> 39:15.486
Where she's from.

39:16.821 --> 39:20.591
What her relationship
with her family's like.

39:20.624 --> 39:22.026
- No, not really.

39:23.127 --> 39:26.864
I assumed she was just
repressing her memory, you know?

39:26.897 --> 39:29.633
She would've told me
when she was ready.

39:29.667 --> 39:32.436
- Do you even know
her last name?

39:35.005 --> 39:35.840
- No.

39:36.807 --> 39:39.009
No, I guess I don't.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.644
- Let me tell you something.

39:40.678 --> 39:42.146
This broken girl
that you describe

39:42.179 --> 39:44.615
doesn't seem so broken to me.

39:46.484 --> 39:49.620
Seems she's actually a
very normal young woman.

39:49.653 --> 39:51.622
She graduated from
a good college.

39:51.655 --> 39:53.224
She had loving parents.

39:53.257 --> 39:55.493
She was raised in a
good neighborhood.

39:55.526 --> 39:56.761
According to her
place of employment,

39:56.794 --> 39:58.095
she's just a
happy-go-lucky person.

39:58.129 --> 39:58.929
- That's bullshit.

39:58.963 --> 40:00.164
- That's bullshit?

40:00.197 --> 40:01.465
- Yeah, she was
an alcoholic mess.

40:01.499 --> 40:02.767
There's no way she held a job.

40:02.800 --> 40:03.968
- Oh yeah?

40:04.001 --> 40:06.003
You didn't even know
she had a job, did you?

40:06.036 --> 40:08.706
Maybe that was just another
thing that she repressed

40:08.739 --> 40:10.541
and wasn't ready to tell you.

40:10.574 --> 40:12.476
- Where? Huh?

40:12.510 --> 40:13.544
Where'd she work?

40:13.577 --> 40:14.645
- What's it to you?

40:14.678 --> 40:16.013
She didn't want to tell you.

40:16.046 --> 40:17.915
Maybe she thought
you were dangerous.

40:18.883 --> 40:20.084
- No, she'd never think that.

40:20.117 --> 40:21.018
- Maybe she thought
she shouldn't tell you

40:21.051 --> 40:23.087
because you made her
fear for your life.

40:23.954 --> 40:24.889
- That's not true.

40:24.922 --> 40:25.723
- Not true?

40:25.756 --> 40:27.191
Not true?

40:27.224 --> 40:30.461
Let me tell you
something that is true.

40:32.563 --> 40:34.899
- My master,

40:34.932 --> 40:36.534
my puppeteer,

40:36.567 --> 40:37.735
my everything.

40:38.602 --> 40:39.603
I'm nothing.

40:41.038 --> 40:43.874
His every word floats
from his lips into the air

40:43.908 --> 40:48.913
and hangs there, balanced
by what is and what isn't.

40:50.147 --> 40:51.849
His eyes dart this
way and that way,

40:51.882 --> 40:55.085
as if in constant
search for an answer

40:55.119 --> 40:56.720
that doesn't exist.

40:57.888 --> 41:01.158
His breath uneven,
like with his future.

41:02.760 --> 41:06.230
Who is he but a small boy
who plays with blocks,

41:06.263 --> 41:09.934
building the house he
would never reside in?

41:11.235 --> 41:14.071
A young man who would
conjure up a world

41:14.104 --> 41:16.607
that would be but
a sweet rivalry.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.677
An adult who would have
his happiness shatter

41:19.710 --> 41:23.280
into a million pieces on
the living room floor.

41:23.314 --> 41:26.050
God save this poor man.

41:26.083 --> 41:29.920
God save the dream
which is his happiness.

41:29.954 --> 41:33.224
God save the shade
in which he creates.

41:33.257 --> 41:35.860
May they find peace and solace.

41:37.294 --> 41:39.563
- Wait a second, your favorite
instrument isn't the guitar?

41:39.597 --> 41:40.631
What's wrong with you?

41:40.664 --> 41:42.266
- No, I like the piano.

41:42.299 --> 41:44.568
- Oh my God.

41:44.602 --> 41:45.669
- What's wrong with the piano?

41:45.703 --> 41:48.239
- You are such a dork.

41:48.272 --> 41:49.640
- Whatever.

41:49.673 --> 41:51.075
Maybe I'm too
sophisticated for you.

41:52.042 --> 41:52.877
- Okay.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.114
- Bed time.

41:57.147 --> 41:58.349
- What?

41:58.382 --> 42:01.352
- You put away your toys
and brush your teeth?

42:01.385 --> 42:02.286
- Yes, sir.

42:03.754 --> 42:05.189
- Okay.

42:05.222 --> 42:06.123
Lights out!

42:06.991 --> 42:07.791
- What?

42:20.170 --> 42:22.273
- Shower time.

42:30.014 --> 42:33.317
- How many days have
we been locked in this cage?

42:33.350 --> 42:35.619
He wants to do it.

42:35.653 --> 42:37.054
I can tell.

42:37.087 --> 42:40.190
He asks himself every
day if he should do it.

42:40.224 --> 42:42.626
He's not used to being trapped.

42:42.660 --> 42:45.262
Although, in some
ways he always was.

42:45.296 --> 42:49.333
His weeps aren't
solely for his sorrows

42:49.366 --> 42:52.636
but for the loss of
her, his freedom.

42:53.304 --> 42:54.638
He's delusional.

42:55.372 --> 42:57.875
Unaware of the truth.

42:57.908 --> 42:59.710
- Hey.

42:59.743 --> 43:00.377
Hey.

43:02.079 --> 43:03.747
Your lawyer is here.

43:07.751 --> 43:09.219
- Hello, Darwin.

43:09.253 --> 43:11.055
- What the hell is going on?

43:11.088 --> 43:12.289
- It doesn't look good.

43:12.323 --> 43:14.124
- What do you mean,
it doesn't look good?

43:14.158 --> 43:16.193
- Your bail
is way too high.

43:16.226 --> 43:17.661
- Get the money.

43:17.695 --> 43:18.595
- How?

43:18.629 --> 43:19.797
The only way would
be to go through some

43:19.830 --> 43:23.434
unconventional methods that
could end up hurting both of us.

43:23.467 --> 43:25.769
- I don't care, I need
to get out of here.

43:25.803 --> 43:28.839
I need to get out of here
and figure out some answers.

43:28.872 --> 43:30.674
- Answers for what?

43:30.708 --> 43:32.943
- For who killed her.

43:32.977 --> 43:36.413
- There's too much evidence
stacked against you.

43:36.447 --> 43:39.183
- Peter, I didn't do it.

43:39.216 --> 43:41.051
I didn't kill her.

43:44.054 --> 43:45.356
- Look,

43:45.389 --> 43:47.391
let's see what I can do.

43:54.732 --> 43:56.433
Do you believe in God, son?

45:06.804 --> 45:07.771
- Excuse me,

45:07.805 --> 45:08.472
who the hell are you?

45:08.505 --> 45:10.107
- I'm Darwin.

45:10.140 --> 45:12.242
- Well Darwin, you're not
supposed to be in this property.

45:12.276 --> 45:13.544
- I live here.

45:13.577 --> 45:14.378
- No you don't.

45:14.411 --> 45:15.212
- Yes I do.

45:15.245 --> 45:16.480
- No you don't.

45:16.513 --> 45:18.949
You're not supposed to
be in here, nobody is.

45:18.982 --> 45:20.918
- Are you fucking
crazy? I live here!

45:20.951 --> 45:22.820
- I'm not crazy.

45:22.853 --> 45:26.356
I'm the property manager and
your name is not on the list.

45:26.390 --> 45:27.291
Look at the mail.

45:27.324 --> 45:28.926
"Christine Thompson."

45:28.959 --> 45:31.195
You don't look like a
Christine Thompson to me.

45:31.228 --> 45:32.396
- Fuck what the mail
says, all right?

45:32.429 --> 45:33.530
I fucking live here!

45:33.564 --> 45:35.466
- Look, let me tell you
something, you little fuck!

45:35.499 --> 45:40.370
You don't live here and you
need to get out of here now!

45:43.373 --> 45:44.208
- Fine.

46:41.131 --> 46:42.966
- Can I ask you a
personal question?

46:43.000 --> 46:44.168
- You haven't done that already?

46:45.903 --> 46:47.237
- Fine, nevermind.

46:47.271 --> 46:48.405
- No, no, tell me.

46:48.438 --> 46:49.573
- Nope, forget it.

46:49.606 --> 46:51.241
- Come on, shoot.

46:52.176 --> 46:53.010
- Okay.

46:55.145 --> 46:57.147
- Do you believe in God?

46:59.383 --> 47:00.217
- Uh.

47:01.585 --> 47:02.853
I don't know.

47:03.654 --> 47:04.588
I don't know.

47:04.621 --> 47:05.622
What about you?

47:05.656 --> 47:07.257
- Believe in God?

47:08.559 --> 47:09.393
No.

47:10.460 --> 47:13.030
No, I do not believe in God.

47:13.063 --> 47:14.298
- Well I sure hope there is one,

47:14.331 --> 47:17.367
because if this is
it, this is horrible.

47:17.401 --> 47:18.502
- This is it.

47:20.270 --> 47:22.639
This is all there will ever be.

47:25.008 --> 47:25.642
What?

47:27.110 --> 47:27.945
- Nothing.

47:29.112 --> 47:32.149
There's worse things than
cheap Italian dinners with you.

47:33.584 --> 47:34.418
Yeah.

47:36.119 --> 47:38.388
- How do
you think you'll die?

47:38.422 --> 47:41.925
I want my happy life to
have a beautiful ending.

47:41.959 --> 47:44.628
Is that so much to ask?

47:44.661 --> 47:47.564
To have some sort of
beauty in my life,

47:47.598 --> 47:50.634
even if it's at
the very end of it.

47:50.667 --> 47:52.135
Now it doesn't.

47:53.637 --> 47:54.471
Never has.

47:55.505 --> 47:59.376
You can't choose the
life of beauty and grace.

48:01.044 --> 48:01.645
Of fortune

48:03.714 --> 48:04.548
and glory.

48:06.116 --> 48:07.284
Don't you see?

48:09.319 --> 48:13.557
Don't you see the situation
most of us are left in?

48:15.726 --> 48:17.461
We are the abandoned.

48:18.996 --> 48:20.998
We aren't the repressed,

48:21.031 --> 48:24.034
or the poor or even
the lower class.

48:26.370 --> 48:28.038
We are the forsaken.

48:31.742 --> 48:35.579
We are the shadow of
those who live the light.

48:37.381 --> 48:38.615
I'll forever be

48:41.118 --> 48:42.519
left in the dark,

48:44.021 --> 48:45.689
looking on to those lucky few

48:45.722 --> 48:49.493
who live their
life in contentment

48:49.526 --> 48:50.327
and dignity.

48:52.062 --> 48:55.065
All we can do is
pray there is more.

48:56.433 --> 49:01.104
Pray that after death we
will finally be in the light.

49:08.045 --> 49:09.046
- Excuse me.

49:11.181 --> 49:12.382
- What's up?

49:12.416 --> 49:14.017
- I picked up a girl
here a few months ago

49:14.051 --> 49:15.686
that bought some stuff from you.

49:15.719 --> 49:17.621
Can you tell me what?

49:17.654 --> 49:20.691
- I don't know what the
fuck you talking about.

49:20.724 --> 49:22.693
But if you wanna buy something,

49:22.726 --> 49:25.295
you need to move
the fuck around.

49:25.329 --> 49:27.164
- Look, man, I'm not a
police officer, okay?

49:27.197 --> 49:28.365
I just need some
information on her.

49:28.398 --> 49:30.600
- Look, I know you not a cop.

49:30.634 --> 49:32.569
I don't deal too many girls.

49:32.602 --> 49:34.671
- That's bullshit, I saw you
sell to her a few weeks ago.

49:34.705 --> 49:35.872
- It's not bullshit.

49:35.906 --> 49:40.477
I haven't did a deal with a
girl in at least a year or two.

49:40.510 --> 49:41.378
- Really?

49:41.411 --> 49:42.245
- Really.

49:43.780 --> 49:44.781
- All right.

49:49.119 --> 49:51.521
You said you know
I wasn't a cop.

49:51.555 --> 49:52.789
- What?

49:52.823 --> 49:54.458
- You said you knew
that I wasn't a cop.

49:54.491 --> 49:55.792
How?

49:55.826 --> 49:59.763
- Seriously, lay off the
drugs for awhile, man.

50:10.140 --> 50:12.309
- How many drinks
have you had today?

50:12.342 --> 50:13.543
- A few drinks.

50:13.577 --> 50:14.778
- A few drinks?

50:14.811 --> 50:18.148
The whole fucking
bottle is gone.

50:18.181 --> 50:18.815
- Okay.

50:20.550 --> 50:22.352
I'll take a break.

50:25.322 --> 50:26.223
Hey!

50:26.256 --> 50:28.358
You don't know shit, all right?

50:28.392 --> 50:31.294
- That's because you never
fucking tell me shit!

50:31.328 --> 50:32.629
I've told you
everything about my life

50:32.662 --> 50:34.698
and you're a fucking mystery!

50:34.731 --> 50:35.799
Besides how your
uncle raped you.

50:35.832 --> 50:36.733
- Fuck you!

50:41.905 --> 50:43.507
- Look, you can try
and switch perspectives

50:43.540 --> 50:45.142
as much as you want.

50:45.175 --> 50:46.643
But you are Darwin,

50:46.676 --> 50:48.779
the unemployed bum with
a fucked up history.

50:48.812 --> 50:49.646
And that's all you're
every going to be.

50:49.679 --> 50:50.514
- Shut up!

50:56.787 --> 50:58.388
- Look, you're not me.

50:58.422 --> 50:59.623
Okay?

50:59.656 --> 51:01.892
You're not fucking me.

51:01.925 --> 51:02.859
Are you listening?

51:02.893 --> 51:04.161
You're not fucking me!

51:04.194 --> 51:05.328
Fuck you! Fuck you!

51:05.362 --> 51:06.863
Fuck you!

51:06.897 --> 51:09.900
Fuck you!

51:13.937 --> 51:16.873
- And so
everyday he cries.

51:16.907 --> 51:19.443
Yelling things into the air.

51:20.877 --> 51:23.213
We are opposites, him and I.

51:24.614 --> 51:26.917
He lost in fantasy,

51:26.950 --> 51:28.552
I stuck in reality.

51:30.220 --> 51:33.156
Both of us experiencing
the same experience

51:33.190 --> 51:35.859
from a different perspective.

51:35.892 --> 51:38.261
If only I could fantasize.

51:39.229 --> 51:41.131
If only I could escape.

52:29.946 --> 52:30.881
- Let's go.

52:47.964 --> 52:48.798
- So,

52:49.966 --> 52:52.769
what do you want to
do with the body?

52:53.970 --> 52:57.774
Do you have a relative
to come pick it up?

52:57.807 --> 52:59.242
- I don't know.

53:08.885 --> 53:10.921
I don't have anyone.

53:10.954 --> 53:11.922
- Okay, fine.

53:11.955 --> 53:14.658
We'll burry you here.

53:14.691 --> 53:15.525
Sign this.

53:33.009 --> 53:34.244
Great.

53:35.512 --> 53:37.681
Now, about your last meal.

53:39.616 --> 53:42.552
Do you want anything
in particular?

53:44.454 --> 53:47.290
- I want chicken
parmesan, extra cheese.

53:47.324 --> 53:49.960
- I think we can
accommodate that.

53:52.095 --> 53:54.331
Do you believe in God?

53:56.566 --> 53:57.801
- No.

56:10.133 --> 56:11.701
- Yeah?

56:11.735 --> 56:13.403
Oh yeah, absolutely.

56:14.170 --> 56:15.739
No.

56:15.772 --> 56:16.706
No.

56:16.740 --> 56:18.808
The whole thing was a setup.

56:18.842 --> 56:20.076
Of course.

56:20.110 --> 56:22.679
Oh, he's gonna get convicted.

56:22.712 --> 56:23.546
Yeah.

56:29.052 --> 56:30.186
What?!

56:30.220 --> 56:32.155
- This fucking
thing was a setup?!

56:32.188 --> 56:34.157
What're you talking about?

56:34.190 --> 56:34.991
- Did you fucking killer?

56:35.024 --> 56:36.126
I have no idea.

56:36.159 --> 56:37.560
- Who fucking killed her?!

56:37.594 --> 56:39.062
- Who?

56:39.095 --> 56:40.096
- Christine!

56:41.264 --> 56:43.900
Who fucking killed her?

56:43.933 --> 56:46.002
Did you fucking kill her?

56:48.104 --> 56:49.639
- Yes.

56:49.672 --> 56:51.141
I did.

56:56.880 --> 56:59.883
What the fuck are
you talking about?

57:18.601 --> 57:19.235
- Eat.

57:20.170 --> 57:21.871
It's getting cold.

57:26.276 --> 57:30.213
You ever read anything
by Dostoyevsky?

57:30.246 --> 57:31.915
Yeah.

57:31.948 --> 57:36.219
I'm not a huge reader but I
am a huge fan of his work.

57:37.287 --> 57:39.489
Now, he wrote this book,

57:40.557 --> 57:42.992
"The Idiot," it's called.

57:43.026 --> 57:45.128
There's this character in it.

57:45.161 --> 57:47.730
Myshkin, or something like that.

57:47.764 --> 57:51.100
Anyways, he said that
capital punishment

57:53.102 --> 57:56.206
is worse than the
crime committed.

57:56.239 --> 58:01.177
His reasoning was that if
you were stabbed or shot

58:01.211 --> 58:03.847
you suffered from physical pain

58:03.880 --> 58:06.049
and were distracted by it.

58:07.317 --> 58:11.988
As if physical pain distracted
from the act of dying itself.

58:13.122 --> 58:14.691
One wouldn't be
spiritually tortured

58:14.724 --> 58:15.959
but physically.

58:18.995 --> 58:20.230
Now he also said,

58:24.167 --> 58:28.538
there are a lot of times
when one hopes to escape.

58:29.806 --> 58:32.809
If a coldblooded killer is
chasing you with a knife,

58:32.842 --> 58:37.313
you have a chance, even if
it is a small one, to escape.

58:39.816 --> 58:43.219
But there is no escaping
a death penalty.

58:45.722 --> 58:47.323
Take a soldier out,

58:48.925 --> 58:51.361
sit him facing a canon

58:51.394 --> 58:52.996
and fire it at him,

58:53.830 --> 58:55.665
he'll still have hope.

58:57.233 --> 58:58.801
But you read a sentence
of certain death

58:58.835 --> 59:01.604
over that same soldier

59:01.638 --> 59:04.007
and he will go out of his mind.

59:06.276 --> 59:09.012
I think I agree with that.

59:09.045 --> 59:09.879
Don't you?

59:12.315 --> 59:14.284
- I'm not sure.

59:14.317 --> 59:15.151
- Now,

59:16.653 --> 59:18.621
I'm gonna ask you what
I've asked everyone

59:18.655 --> 59:21.791
who I have ever shared
a last meal with.

59:24.127 --> 59:25.895
Why did you kill her?

59:27.330 --> 59:30.967
Why did you take this
young woman's wife?

59:32.435 --> 59:34.904
- I didn't take her life.

59:34.938 --> 59:36.105
She took mine.

59:41.711 --> 59:43.813
- The day has come.

59:43.846 --> 59:45.682
The clock has ran out.

59:46.783 --> 59:49.919
The clock isn't
really a clock, is it?

59:49.953 --> 59:51.387
But an hourglass,

59:52.789 --> 59:55.325
the grains of sand
fall, one by one,

59:55.358 --> 59:59.095
into the void that will
someday consume us all.

01:00:00.797 --> 01:00:01.798
Look at him.

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:05.001
He still denies the truth.

01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:08.371
Still lost in the fantasy.

01:00:52.315 --> 01:00:54.350
- Darwin Thomas Barnes,

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:56.786
you have been sentenced to death

01:00:56.819 --> 01:01:01.157
for the murder of Christine
Meredith Thompson.

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:03.993
May God have mercy on your soul.

01:05:16.045 --> 01:05:18.748
- For what
seems like hours, he runs.

01:05:18.781 --> 01:05:21.717
Never stopping,
never looking back.

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.654
He heads into something new.

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:27.089
Something with hope.

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:29.125
He heads into the light.

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:31.527
He stands still,

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.162
shivering in the cold,

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:34.664
I lay on the ground.

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:40.202
Gazing up at the vast length
of God that is upon us.

01:05:41.704 --> 01:05:44.674
Only he never
escaped the prison.

01:05:46.075 --> 01:05:50.680
I finally broke that wall
and imagined the whole thing.

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:52.748
As for my puppeteer,

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:53.616
my master,

01:05:54.717 --> 01:05:55.685
my everything,

01:05:57.753 --> 01:06:01.057
sometimes the breathless
breathe easier.

01:06:02.305 --> 01:06:08.187
