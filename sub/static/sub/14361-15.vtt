WEBVTT

00:01.671 --> 00:04.440
(Crows cawing)

00:04.475 --> 00:06.809
<i>(Frankie) There are all
kinds of Valentine's gifts.</i>

00:06.843 --> 00:08.861
<i>Some are better than
others, but the best ones</i>

00:08.896 --> 00:11.030
<i>come straight from the heart.</i>

00:11.065 --> 00:13.950
Oh, my gosh. Brick!

00:13.984 --> 00:16.035
I love it.

00:16.070 --> 00:18.371
So... pretty.

00:18.405 --> 00:19.939
I know I'm supposed to
wait till Valentine's Day,

00:19.973 --> 00:23.025
but I just couldn't. I think
it's some of my best work.

00:23.043 --> 00:24.160
And I think you'd be right.

00:24.194 --> 00:27.163
Oh, thank you so much, Brick.

00:27.197 --> 00:31.250
Oh. I am gonna cherish this forever.

00:33.203 --> 00:35.371
(Clatter)

00:35.389 --> 00:37.706
<i>(TV playing indistinctly) Hey, dad,
I know you're probably wondering</i>

00:37.725 --> 00:39.892
what I'm doing for Valentine's Day.

00:39.927 --> 00:41.544
I don't exactly have a date,

00:41.562 --> 00:42.545
and that could really bum me out,

00:42.563 --> 00:44.230
'cause last year was so great

00:44.264 --> 00:46.432
- 'cause I had Matt and everything.
- Your mom's in the kitchen.

00:46.483 --> 00:48.601
She told me you guys were in here.

00:48.652 --> 00:50.853
Anyway, the school is having a dance,

00:50.887 --> 00:53.222
and I signed up to be
on the cleanup committee.

00:53.240 --> 00:54.524
I may not be in love,

00:54.558 --> 00:56.442
but I can still clean
up for people in love.

00:56.493 --> 00:58.778
Oh, my God. Nobody goes to that lame dance.

00:58.829 --> 01:00.997
You're just mad because your
girlfriend is out of town.

01:01.031 --> 01:02.615
She's at a wedding...
something you'll never be in.

01:02.666 --> 01:04.083
I suggest buying a wacky hat

01:04.117 --> 01:05.752
and starting your cat collection now.

01:05.786 --> 01:09.255
That's not even an insult. I love cats.

01:09.289 --> 01:13.092
So, dad, are you doing anything
for mom for Valentine's Day?

01:13.127 --> 01:15.878
<i>Anything romantic?</i>

01:15.912 --> 01:17.296
Ah, we're not those kind of people.

01:17.331 --> 01:18.431
But you have to do something,

01:18.465 --> 01:21.884
even if it's just writing her a note

01:21.918 --> 01:25.138
or sending a cute text telling
her how much you love her.

01:25.189 --> 01:28.107
Well, I'm doing something.
I'm taking the Christmas tree

01:28.142 --> 01:29.258
out to the curb without being asked.

01:31.895 --> 01:34.147
(School bell rings) This is it?

01:34.198 --> 01:37.150
I thought you said Boss Co.
would be in the black by now.

01:37.201 --> 01:38.401
Is black the good one or the bad one?

01:38.435 --> 01:39.535
Look, we really ate it,

01:39.570 --> 01:40.787
trying to get that
possum out of the garage.

01:40.821 --> 01:42.822
Between Darrin's stitches
and the rabies shots,

01:42.873 --> 01:44.240
we got hosed.

01:44.274 --> 01:45.792
I can still see those
pink eyes coming at me.

01:45.826 --> 01:48.795
That's it, dudes. We're broke.

01:48.829 --> 01:51.764
And we can't lay anybody
off, 'cause we're all bosses.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.914
How can we be so powerful and
powerless at the same time?

01:54.948 --> 01:56.148
I can't believe you're breaking up with me

01:56.183 --> 01:58.484
- right before Valentine's Day.
- I'm sorry!

01:58.518 --> 02:00.503
Really, I don't know what else to say.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.222
Well, thanks a lot. Now I
don't have a date to the dance.

02:03.540 --> 02:06.342
I hate you! (Cries)

02:06.376 --> 02:07.943
(All) Whoa.

02:07.978 --> 02:09.061
(Snaps fingers)

02:09.079 --> 02:11.330
Wait a sec. There's a lot of guys

02:11.364 --> 02:12.531
wanting to get out of relationships

02:12.549 --> 02:14.466
before Valentine's Day, right?

02:14.484 --> 02:16.301
That way, they can avoid
spending all that money

02:16.319 --> 02:18.504
and taking things to the next level.

02:18.538 --> 02:20.256
- Go on.
- I will.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.273
Breaking up in person's horrible,

02:21.308 --> 02:22.575
and the text dump can be forwarded,

02:22.609 --> 02:25.377
<i>land you on the douche
list, so what if we did it?</i>

02:26.071 --> 02:27.472
Did what?

02:27.506 --> 02:30.625
What if guys paid us to break
up with the girls for them? Huh?

02:30.660 --> 02:32.410
Boss Co. breakup service.

02:32.445 --> 02:34.679
(Both laughing)

02:34.714 --> 02:37.732
Okay. Explain it to me one more time.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:46.583 --> 02:50.019
Mother? Why is this in the trash?

02:50.053 --> 02:52.771
Oh! Thank God you found it!

02:52.806 --> 02:56.025
<i>I have been looking everywhere for that.</i>

02:56.059 --> 02:58.060
Uh-huh. You are a lousy liar.

02:58.094 --> 03:00.079
(Sighs) Okay. Here's the thing.

03:00.113 --> 03:01.430
You guys bring home a lot of stuff,

03:01.464 --> 03:03.883
and that's great, but
I can't keep everything,

03:03.917 --> 03:06.385
and truthfully, this is not your best work.

03:06.419 --> 03:08.270
And yet you keep this picture Axl drew

03:08.305 --> 03:09.955
of two butts orbing in the earth.

03:09.973 --> 03:13.776
(Sighs) Are the butrronauts
still up there? (Clatter)

03:13.827 --> 03:15.227
(Sighs)

03:15.245 --> 03:18.180
Look, Brick, I didn't throw
everything of yours away.

03:18.215 --> 03:20.065
I saved the important stuff.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.584
Oh. Where is it?

03:21.618 --> 03:24.103
Put away in boxes.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.305
Can I see it? The years
have gone by so fast,

03:26.323 --> 03:28.207
I'd like to reminisce.

03:28.241 --> 03:29.208
(Whispers) Reminisce.

03:29.242 --> 03:30.426
That's fine.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.144
But you know, all the
current magazines are saying

03:32.178 --> 03:33.963
we should live in the present, so... 

03:33.997 --> 03:35.281
Find it.

03:35.315 --> 03:37.983
(Sue screaming)

03:38.018 --> 03:39.818
I've got a date to the dance!

03:39.853 --> 03:42.421
Oh! I'm not gonna be a loser after all.

03:42.455 --> 03:44.340
Oh, my God. I'm so relieved.
I can barely breathe.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.391
So what happened?

03:45.425 --> 03:47.443
Well, I just got off the phone with Matt.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.411
Turns out he broke up with Sheri.

03:49.446 --> 03:52.181
I knew it wouldn't last.
And he realized he missed me

03:52.215 --> 03:55.317
and loved me and couldn't live without me.

03:55.352 --> 03:57.820
And he asked if he could
have the honor of taking me

03:57.871 --> 03:59.938
to the Valentine's dance!

03:59.956 --> 04:01.207
(Screaming)

04:01.241 --> 04:04.343
Oh, honey. That's so great.

04:04.377 --> 04:05.644
I'm gonna ride my bike over to Carly's

04:05.678 --> 04:07.780
and tell her all about it. Aah!

04:07.814 --> 04:08.847
(Door opens)

04:09.985 --> 04:11.652
(Door closes) (Gasps) Guess what, dad?

04:11.687 --> 04:13.421
I'm going to the dance after all!

04:13.455 --> 04:15.173
<i>Romantic, huh?</i>

04:15.207 --> 04:17.725
Oh, and I see the tree's still up.

04:17.776 --> 04:18.809
Just sayin'.

04:18.827 --> 04:21.045
Aah!

04:22.798 --> 04:25.466
So you are... Amanda, right? (Pen clicks)

04:25.501 --> 04:27.201
And you date Connor?

04:27.252 --> 04:28.686
Now this may seem abrupt... (Pen clicks)

04:28.721 --> 04:31.689
but now that you're both
seniors and going to college,

04:31.723 --> 04:34.825
he feels it's a natural time
to start seeing other people.

04:34.843 --> 04:36.894
- What?
- He's very much enjoyed your time together,

04:36.929 --> 04:39.230
but I'm afraid that time
has... come to an end.

04:39.264 --> 04:40.598
And he would've been here himself,

04:40.632 --> 04:42.683
but he thought this was for the best.

04:42.718 --> 04:45.019
I can't believe he's
doing this. What a jerk!

04:45.054 --> 04:46.521
Don't despair.

04:46.572 --> 04:49.574
You're a beautiful young lady
with lots of love ahead of you.

04:49.608 --> 04:51.476
Any guy would be lucky to have you.

04:51.510 --> 04:54.595
Just not Connor.

04:56.949 --> 04:58.349
(Rustles)

04:59.635 --> 05:02.520
(Dog barking in distance)

05:06.991 --> 05:11.261
"I know I never say it, but
you're very special to me."

05:11.296 --> 05:12.729
(Beep)

05:16.334 --> 05:20.137
(Cell phone buzzes)

05:20.171 --> 05:23.974
"You're special to me, too." Jim?

05:34.502 --> 05:37.287
(Door closes)

05:37.305 --> 05:41.108
Ah, Jim, uh... hey,
listen, about that text... 

05:41.142 --> 05:44.144
Yeah. I was kinda wanting
to talk to you about it, too.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.929
Uh, no. We don't have to do that.

05:45.963 --> 05:48.598
See, uh, in fact, that text was... 

05:48.633 --> 05:50.150
The nicest thing anybody's ever done.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.918
I'll just say it.

05:51.953 --> 05:53.854
You're the best boss I've ever had, Mike.

05:53.888 --> 05:56.940
Uh, all right, then. Thanks.

05:56.991 --> 06:01.077
I've been... kinda going
through a rough patch lately,

06:01.095 --> 06:04.264
and you telling me I'm special
is just the boost I needed.

06:04.298 --> 06:05.432
Uh-huh.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.567
Yeah.

06:07.602 --> 06:09.736
I never told anyone this.

06:09.771 --> 06:12.606
But I've always had a hard time fitting in.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.609
When you're a kid, all you
wanna do is belong, you know?

06:15.660 --> 06:17.210
Sure.

06:17.245 --> 06:19.930
See, I started going bald
when I was in grade school.

06:19.964 --> 06:24.401
You ever see a 180-pound
12-year-old with a comb-over?

06:24.435 --> 06:27.254
(Exhales) It feels good just to say it.

06:27.288 --> 06:29.339
(Exhales deeply)

06:29.357 --> 06:30.524
I heard about your guys' service,

06:30.575 --> 06:31.625
and I wanna dump my girlfriend,

06:31.659 --> 06:32.793
but I don't wanna hurt her feelings.

06:32.964 --> 06:34.347
You've come to the right place, Evan.

06:34.382 --> 06:35.682
(Bell rings) What am I signing?

06:35.733 --> 06:37.300
Ah, it's a standard release form

06:37.318 --> 06:39.619
saying we're not liable
if anything goes wrong.

06:39.654 --> 06:42.589
And that if your ex is hot,
we, the members of Boss Co.,

06:42.623 --> 06:43.974
reserve the right to ask her out

06:44.008 --> 06:47.544
after the appropriate 7-day waiting period.

06:47.578 --> 06:50.096
Correction... 3-day waiting period.

06:50.147 --> 06:53.533
Sorry, Rachel, but Spencer
feels you two have grown apart.

06:53.568 --> 06:54.951
(Crying) It's never gonna work.

06:54.969 --> 06:58.722
(Sobbing)

06:59.756 --> 07:01.707
We're sorry, Miss Poltorak,
but Mr. Whiteman thinks

07:01.758 --> 07:03.642
you guys are looking for different things.

07:03.693 --> 07:05.277
You're too good for him anyway.

07:05.328 --> 07:06.328
Really?

07:06.363 --> 07:08.097
Definitely.

07:08.131 --> 07:09.732
Now could you go online
and take a brief survey

07:09.766 --> 07:12.234
saying you were broken up with
in a kind and courteous manner?

07:12.269 --> 07:13.552
Oh, and if you could take a moment

07:13.587 --> 07:16.522
to "like" us on Facebook,
that would also be great.

07:17.056 --> 07:18.557
<i>So Brick's stuff was missing,</i>

07:18.591 --> 07:21.242
<i>and knowing Brick, he
wasn't gonna let it go.</i>

07:21.260 --> 07:22.410
<i>I learned my lesson.</i>

07:22.428 --> 07:24.896
<i>Next time I throw away
any more art projects,</i>

07:24.931 --> 07:26.815
<i>I'm using the dumpster
behind the mini-mart.</i>

07:26.849 --> 07:29.868
<i>Anyway, I was desperate,
and I knew what I had to do.</i>

07:29.902 --> 07:31.153
Hey, Nancy.

07:31.187 --> 07:34.306
Oh, hi, Frankie. Wanna
come in for a cinnamon bun

07:34.340 --> 07:35.590
and watch Dr. Oz?

07:35.625 --> 07:37.425
Oh, no, thanks.

07:37.443 --> 07:38.944
Listen, this is kind of embarrassing,

07:38.978 --> 07:42.431
but I can't find any of
Brick's old art projects.

07:42.465 --> 07:43.899
I'm pretty sure Mike threw them all out.

07:43.933 --> 07:46.051
Men do the craziest things, huh?

07:46.265 --> 07:48.066
Tell me about it. Remember Ron's perm?

07:48.100 --> 07:51.836
Ooh. Anyway, I was
wondering if I could borrow

07:51.887 --> 07:54.773
one of your kids' old projects
and pass it off as Brick's.

07:54.824 --> 07:57.042
Absolutely. Believe me, I get it.

07:57.076 --> 08:01.279
Three kids... no way you
can keep up with everything.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.198
(Click)

08:03.232 --> 08:05.166
(Whirring)

08:05.201 --> 08:07.352
(Gasps)

08:07.403 --> 08:09.237
(Singsongy) Hey, lookie what I found.

08:09.271 --> 08:11.923
(Normal voice) Brick's
centerpiece from Thanksgiving.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.658
There's no way in hell Brick made that.

08:13.693 --> 08:16.895
(Sighs) Damn it, and this
was the worst one, too.

08:17.676 --> 08:21.012
(Sighs) I can't believe I
threw away all my son's stuff.

08:21.046 --> 08:23.030
Seriously, what kind of a mother am I?

08:23.081 --> 08:25.599
According to Brick's school,
not actively involved.

08:25.634 --> 08:26.667
Well, they're right, Mike.

08:26.702 --> 08:28.819
I'm a terrible, terrible mother.

08:28.853 --> 08:33.491
Uh... what were the
buttronauts doing in the trash?

08:33.525 --> 08:35.743
Do you not understand what
the buttronauts represent?

08:35.777 --> 08:37.861
They represent butts in space.

08:37.895 --> 08:40.347
Show a little respect.

08:42.984 --> 08:45.820
(Whistle blows in distance)

08:46.794 --> 08:48.678
I'm a good guy, Mike.

08:48.713 --> 08:50.346
I bust my hump around here.

08:50.364 --> 08:51.614
Yeah. You work hard.

08:51.649 --> 08:52.816
When why didn't I get

08:52.850 --> 08:55.418
a sweet, heartfelt text
from you like Jim did?

08:55.453 --> 08:57.754
Oh, no. Look, Dave, that was... 

08:57.772 --> 09:00.189
I thought we were more than co-workers.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.975
I thought we were friends.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.060
I mean, we watch games together.

09:04.095 --> 09:06.229
Your family's been to my church.

09:06.263 --> 09:08.415
I even fixed the hole in your kid's wall.

09:08.449 --> 09:12.152
Okay, fine. You are... 

09:12.186 --> 09:15.622
really valuable around here.

09:15.690 --> 09:17.207
Not feeling it.

09:18.709 --> 09:20.877
You're special to me, too.

09:23.047 --> 09:24.714
All right.

09:24.748 --> 09:26.049
There it is.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.803
Now bring it in for a hug. Come on.

09:29.854 --> 09:33.106
Okay.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.891
All right.

09:43.252 --> 09:45.804

It'll all be over soon.

10:12.448 --> 10:14.633
Aren't you tired of running, Emma?

I'm sorry, but you plus Kyle
no longer equals forever.

10:17.787 --> 10:20.021
(Crying)

10:21.056 --> 10:25.192
So, Brick, listen,

10:25.227 --> 10:27.928
I've looked all over, but I
can't seem to find your stuff,

10:27.963 --> 10:30.064
so I'm just gonna be honest with you.

10:30.098 --> 10:31.732
I think your dad threw it out.

10:32.901 --> 10:34.034
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

10:34.068 --> 10:36.737
I really am. I don't know.

10:36.772 --> 10:38.672
Maybe it's 'cause you're the third kid,

10:38.707 --> 10:40.524
or our house isn't big enough,

10:40.575 --> 10:44.389
or I'm just a sucky parent,
but I don't have your stuff.

10:45.082 --> 10:47.049
You don't have Axl or Sue's stuff either?

10:47.084 --> 10:49.035
We're talking about you now.

10:49.069 --> 10:51.971
But the point is, stuff doesn't matter.

10:51.989 --> 10:54.807
What's important is the feeling
I had when you gave it to me.

10:54.841 --> 10:56.959
I'll never lose that.

10:57.010 --> 10:58.911
I see. So it's all gone.

10:58.946 --> 11:01.063
Nothing of mine made an
impression. Interesting.

11:01.098 --> 11:03.916
Because I distinctly remember
a ceramic sponge caddy

11:03.951 --> 11:05.735
that said "I hate housework."

11:05.786 --> 11:08.421
I'm sorry. Do you like housework?

11:08.455 --> 11:11.173
Because I think that would
be something you would keep.

11:11.208 --> 11:12.558
(Chair scrapes floor)

11:14.361 --> 11:15.928
(Door opens)

11:17.003 --> 11:18.336
I'm just gonna say it.

11:18.371 --> 11:20.772
I've been working here
longer than Jim or Dave.

11:20.806 --> 11:23.608
If anybody should get a
nice text, it should be me.

11:23.643 --> 11:26.778
What about me? You know, I
gave my hearing to this place!

11:26.812 --> 11:28.413
(Men speaking at once)

11:28.447 --> 11:31.149
He gets a text. I don't get a text.

11:31.183 --> 11:32.734
(Men continue speaking at once)

11:32.958 --> 11:37.245
Hey, hey. The text
wasn't even meant for Jim.

11:37.279 --> 11:38.563
Okay? It was supposed to go to my wife

11:38.614 --> 11:40.515
for Valentine's Day.

11:42.251 --> 11:46.688
Wait a minute. That's what
you texted your wife for v-day?

11:47.012 --> 11:49.147
(Chuckles) She's your lady.

11:49.181 --> 11:52.617
You gotta tell her you love her, man.

11:53.167 --> 11:57.065
I'm with Chuck. It sounds
like you have intimacy issues.

11:57.121 --> 11:58.989
You do throw up walls, Mike.

11:59.023 --> 12:01.892
You should talk to somebody.
Our insurance covers half.

12:01.926 --> 12:03.493
Hey, nobody's throwing up any walls.

12:03.528 --> 12:06.329
And for your information,
I didn't just send a text.

12:06.364 --> 12:07.864
I also took the Christmas
tree down to the curb

12:07.899 --> 12:09.332
without being asked.

12:09.366 --> 12:12.285
Hey, don't be afraid, man.

12:12.336 --> 12:15.255
Tonight, when you're on
your futon with your lady,

12:15.289 --> 12:16.640
- you just lay...
- No, no!

12:16.674 --> 12:18.658
That's it. Everybody back to work.

12:20.377 --> 12:22.863
Let's go. Thanks for your interest.

12:25.016 --> 12:26.533
Oh! (Laughs)

12:28.257 --> 12:30.826
(Sniffs) Man, I love America.

12:30.860 --> 12:32.027
Now that I'm rich, I guess
I should finally start

12:32.061 --> 12:33.278
thinking about giving back.

12:33.312 --> 12:35.247
You know, maybe talk to
some loser kid at school

12:35.281 --> 12:37.082
or plant a bush in a park

12:37.116 --> 12:38.617
with a giant plaque with my name on it.

12:38.651 --> 12:41.269
(Laughs) Whoo!

12:41.320 --> 12:44.456
Hey. What's wrong with you, dude?

12:44.474 --> 12:46.908
That breakup with Kelly McCarthy was awful.

12:46.959 --> 12:49.928
Totally blindsided her.
She cried her contacts out,

12:49.946 --> 12:51.696
and then I heard she failed a calculus test

12:51.731 --> 12:52.998
'cause she couldn't see.

12:53.032 --> 12:55.267
She might not get into college.

12:55.301 --> 12:57.235
I need a man's opinion.

12:57.253 --> 12:59.571
For the dance tonight, should
I wear my hair up or down?

12:59.605 --> 13:03.141
Over your face. You can weave it
into your braces so it'll stay.

13:03.176 --> 13:04.443
Up.

13:04.477 --> 13:07.612
Thanks. Mom says my forehead
is one of my best features,

13:07.630 --> 13:09.681
so... 

13:10.795 --> 13:14.164
Look, Sean, it's just
a business, all right?

13:14.199 --> 13:15.449
These girls are gonna
get broken up with anyway.

13:15.483 --> 13:18.269
If we didn't do it, somebody else would've.

13:18.303 --> 13:19.970
This way, we build a successful company,

13:20.005 --> 13:22.239
sell it to the Chinese,
buy some recording time,

13:22.274 --> 13:23.340
cut a hit album, rock the planet,

13:23.374 --> 13:24.975
then start a men's fragrance line.

13:24.993 --> 13:26.794
Yeah, but at what cost?

13:26.828 --> 13:28.546
I agree with Sean.

13:28.580 --> 13:30.164
All this money is covered in tears.

13:30.198 --> 13:31.916
(Telephone ringing) Phone!

13:31.950 --> 13:34.235
<i>- (Sue) So get it!
- No, you get it!</i>

13:34.269 --> 13:36.120
I'm getting ready! I'm
in a business meeting!

13:36.154 --> 13:38.205
- But you're closer!
- So?!

13:38.240 --> 13:41.141
<i>- So get it!
- No, you get it!</i>

13:41.176 --> 13:42.176
(Answering machine beeps)

13:42.600 --> 13:44.685
Uh, hi, Sue. This is Matt.

13:44.719 --> 13:46.219
Listen, Sue, I can't take you to the dance

13:46.254 --> 13:47.487
'cause Sheri and I got back together.

13:47.521 --> 13:49.289
So... hope you're good.

13:49.324 --> 13:51.992
<i>Again, not taking you to the dance.</i>

13:52.026 --> 13:53.060
Sorry. (Beep)

13:53.094 --> 13:54.978
(Answering machine clicks) Wow.

13:55.919 --> 13:58.671
He can't cancel day of.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.040
I mean, yeah, Sue's a dork,
but he knew that going in.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.558
This Matt guy sucks.

14:02.593 --> 14:03.893
Dude, you gotta tell her.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.661
Well, I can't tell her. She's my sister.

14:05.695 --> 14:08.297
What if she... cries or something?

14:08.331 --> 14:11.000
I can't comfort her. I think it's illegal.

14:11.034 --> 14:12.134
Well, don't look at me. I'm spent.

14:12.169 --> 14:14.320
I don't have another breakup in me.

14:15.973 --> 14:18.491
Fine. I'll do it.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.910
What's one more girl who doesn't like me?

14:22.396 --> 14:23.879
(Knock on door)

14:24.807 --> 14:26.691
Uh... hey, Sue.

14:26.726 --> 14:27.692
Hey, Darrin.

14:27.727 --> 14:29.294
Thanks for the hair recommendation.

14:29.328 --> 14:30.929
It does look better up.

14:30.963 --> 14:33.515
<i>So... </i>

14:33.566 --> 14:35.300
what do you think?

14:36.619 --> 14:37.853
You look really nice.

14:37.887 --> 14:39.604
Thank you.

14:39.639 --> 14:43.325
So... listen... about that phone call... 

14:43.359 --> 14:46.278
I don't know how else to do
this but to come out with it.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.381
Matt's back together with
Sheri. He's a major jerk,

14:49.415 --> 14:52.167
and he's not coming to Orson
to take you to the dance.

14:52.201 --> 14:54.703
What?

14:54.737 --> 14:56.671
Please don't make me say it again.

14:56.706 --> 14:58.373
But... 

14:58.407 --> 15:00.075
Oh.

15:00.109 --> 15:03.195
This is so embarrassing.

15:04.019 --> 15:07.338
Oh. I bragged to everyone about
going to the dance with Matt.

15:07.372 --> 15:09.540
I'm really sorry, Sue.

15:09.574 --> 15:12.843
And I still have to go because
I'm on the cleanup committee,

15:12.894 --> 15:14.912
and I'm gonna have to walk in all alone

15:14.946 --> 15:17.031
and watch everyone having a good time

15:17.049 --> 15:20.785
while I mop up their
spills and cupcake sludge.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.370
It's getting really hard to stay optimistic

15:22.404 --> 15:24.021
about this night!

15:24.056 --> 15:25.690
You don't have to walk in alone.

15:25.724 --> 15:26.924
I can take you.

15:26.975 --> 15:29.110
What?

15:29.144 --> 15:32.129
Thanks, but you don't wanna do that.

15:32.164 --> 15:36.617
I know seniors don't go to
the lame Valentine's dance.

15:36.652 --> 15:38.686
No, I want to.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.389
It'll feel good to do
something nice for a change.

15:45.427 --> 15:48.362
<i>(The Chevin's "Beautiful World" playing)</i>

15:52.089 --> 15:56.827
Oh, this is all so beautiful.
I love mirror balls.

15:56.861 --> 15:59.412
Yeah, it does look nice.

15:59.447 --> 16:00.931
Hey, come on.

16:00.965 --> 16:02.499
Let's dance.

16:02.517 --> 16:03.683
(Sue) Yeah. Okay.

16:03.718 --> 16:05.218
<i>* Such a beautiful world</i>

16:15.412 --> 16:16.897

<i>(Tv playing indistinctly)</i>

16:40.338 --> 16:43.808
Man, I never thought about
how we were hurting people.

16:43.842 --> 16:46.127
Ugh. What have we done?

16:46.161 --> 16:47.395
We're love hitmen.

16:47.429 --> 16:48.896
We made money off other people's pain.

16:48.930 --> 16:50.598
Oh, man! I wish we had a time machine

16:50.632 --> 16:53.234
so we could go back and undo everything.

16:53.268 --> 16:55.653
And it would be super cool
just to have a time machine.

16:55.704 --> 16:56.971
Super cool.

16:57.005 --> 16:58.605
(Sighs)

16:59.875 --> 17:01.442
(Snaps fingers) Hang on a sec.

17:01.460 --> 17:04.078
What's the opposite of
breaking things apart?

17:04.112 --> 17:06.113
Well, the opposite of fission is fusion.

17:06.131 --> 17:07.982
Everybody knows that.

17:08.016 --> 17:11.469
Okay. So... what if we
practice some of that fusion

17:11.502 --> 17:13.737
and got one couple together tonight?

17:13.771 --> 17:15.556
Right. Get some isotopes together

17:15.589 --> 17:17.657
and wait for a reaction.

17:17.692 --> 17:19.960
<i>(Chuckles) Uh... yeah.</i>

17:19.978 --> 17:22.313
(Laughs)

17:22.347 --> 17:23.763
We're going out to find a couple

17:23.798 --> 17:26.267
and get them together to
undo all the evil we've done!

17:26.300 --> 17:30.304
(Frankie) Okay! Bring back milk!

17:43.886 --> 17:48.089
Hey, Paige, you look really nice tonight.

17:48.107 --> 17:50.442
So, listen, uh, here's the thing.

17:50.476 --> 17:52.260
You and Wade seemed really good together,

17:52.278 --> 17:55.063
so maybe if you guys just talked, uh... 

17:55.097 --> 17:57.148
Beat it, jerkwads. Haven't you done enough?

17:57.199 --> 17:58.650
Ignore them, Paige.

17:58.701 --> 18:00.735
No, no, we're not like that
anymore. We wanna help now.

18:00.769 --> 18:03.371
Ha. Sure, you do. 'Cause
if you get us back together,

18:03.406 --> 18:06.241
then you can break us up
again and make even more money.

18:06.275 --> 18:08.493
Normally that would be very
sound business practice,

18:08.544 --> 18:11.112
but I promise you that's
not what we're trying to do.

18:11.130 --> 18:13.948
We just wanna undo all we
did and make you guys happy.

18:13.966 --> 18:18.286
You wanna make me happy? Let
me punch your stupid face!

18:18.304 --> 18:20.455
You know, there are chaperones here.

18:20.473 --> 18:22.841
(Girls speaking at once)

18:22.892 --> 18:25.810
We gotta get outta here. Look
at all the rings Becky's wearing.

18:25.845 --> 18:28.763
So... (Chuckles) let's... 
whoo! Look out. (Mutters)

18:28.797 --> 18:30.965
Run! Get 'em!

18:30.983 --> 18:34.352

18:36.972 --> 18:38.306

18:38.444 --> 18:39.760
Happy Valentine's Day.

18:39.778 --> 18:45.533
Oh! Thank you. Oh, they're beautiful.

18:45.568 --> 18:49.621
And happy Valentine's Day back. Mwah.

18:49.655 --> 18:51.272
Well, I stuck to our usual plan

18:51.290 --> 18:53.074
and didn't get you anything.

18:53.108 --> 18:54.542
Mm, well, the guys at the quarry

18:54.577 --> 18:57.545
had some weirdly strong opinions
about what I should do for you

18:57.580 --> 18:59.330
for Valentine's Day.

18:59.381 --> 19:02.000
Aw, well, tell them thanks from me.

Uh-huh. I do.

<i>So... you talk to the

19:20.402 --> 19:23.821
(Chuckles) Sometimes.

19:25.524 --> 19:28.860
You know, you don't have
to stay and help clean up.

19:28.911 --> 19:29.977
You've done enough.

It's okay.

I'm having a good time.

19:33.198 --> 19:34.532
Oh, yeah!

19:34.583 --> 19:35.700
Nothing but net!

19:35.751 --> 19:38.653
(Laughs)

19:38.671 --> 19:40.355
(Sue gasps)

19:40.389 --> 19:42.090
Sorry!

19:43.125 --> 19:46.210
(Both laughing)

19:47.513 --> 19:49.797
(Sighs)

19:49.831 --> 19:51.966
I still can't believe Matt ditched me.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.852
Forget about Matt. He's a loser.

19:54.887 --> 19:56.170
Well, on the bright side,

19:56.188 --> 19:58.106
this is the second time he's dumped me,

19:58.140 --> 20:00.475
so I'll probably get over him faster.

20:00.509 --> 20:02.060
(Paper rustles)

20:04.313 --> 20:07.148
Hey, listen. I know you're a senior,

20:07.182 --> 20:10.118
and you guys don't usually
come to the Valentine's dance,

20:10.152 --> 20:12.853
but I really appreciate you coming with me.

20:12.871 --> 20:15.073
It was really nice of you.

20:20.496 --> 20:21.462
Truth is... 

20:21.497 --> 20:23.998
(Clatters)

20:24.032 --> 20:25.800
I didn't do it to be nice.

20:47.122 --> 20:49.157
<i>Dear Brick, I wanted to take a minute,</i>

20:49.191 --> 20:51.993
<i>on this day devoted to
love, to let you know</i>

20:52.044 --> 20:54.545
<i>that even though I may not be able to find</i>

20:54.580 --> 20:59.383
<i>any of your art projects,
you are always in my heart.</i>

20:59.418 --> 21:02.286
<i>I'm sorry I'm the kind of
mom who's tired all the time,</i>

21:02.321 --> 21:05.122
<i>and I know I'm not the most
organized person in the world.</i>

21:05.140 --> 21:07.008
<i>Maybe I'm lazy. I don't know.</i>

21:07.042 --> 21:09.927
<i>But here's the thing.
This is the mom you got.</i>

21:09.961 --> 21:13.314
<i>I'm not perfect. I'm
flawed... pretty darn flawed.</i>

21:13.348 --> 21:15.299
<i>But I hope you'll read
this and always remember</i>

21:15.317 --> 21:17.902
<i>that on Valentine's Day 2013,</i>

21:17.936 --> 21:21.606
<i>your mom wanted you to
know how much she loves you.</i>

21:21.640 --> 21:23.291
<i>Happy Valentine's Day, sweetie.</i>

21:23.325 --> 21:26.694
<i>All my love forever. Mom.</i>

21:32.367 --> 21:34.318
(Turns on faucet)

21:34.353 --> 21:36.454
(Turns off faucet)
