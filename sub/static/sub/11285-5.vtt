40:00.766 --> 40:02.999
I NEEDED TO KNOW-

40:03.001 --> 40:04.667
WHAT KIND OF MAN
KILLS YOUR DAUGHTER.

40:04.669 --> 40:05.902
PARKER:
EDDIE...

40:07.706 --> 40:08.772
NO.

40:10.108 --> 40:13.109
WHAT KIND OF MAN IT TAKES
TO DO THAT JOB.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.681
I UNDERSTAND...

40:20.419 --> 40:21.885
THERE ARE RULES.

40:21.887 --> 40:23.970
MY HUSBAND-

40:23.971 --> 40:26.054
<i> MY EX-HUSBAND PUT YOU</i>
<i> IN A COMPLICATED SITUATION.</i>

40:26.992 --> 40:29.592
<i> MY DAUGHTER HAD A GUN.</i>

40:31.763 --> 40:33.763
<i> I WAS VERY ANGRY AT YOU.</i>

40:35.867 --> 40:38.935
BUT THEN I STARTED THINKING
ABOUT MY GIRL.

40:40.705 --> 40:42.138
I STARTED THINKING ABOUT...

40:42.140 --> 40:44.974
WHAT SHE WOULD DO
IF SHE WHERE ME?

40:44.976 --> 40:49.212
MR. LANE, SHE ALWAYS SAW
THE BEST IN PEOPLE.

40:49.748 --> 40:52.782
ALWAYS. THAT-THAT'S MAY.
SHE-SHE DID.

40:54.119 --> 40:57.854
I REALIZED SHE'D WANT ME
TO UNDERSTAND.

40:57.856 --> 41:00.957
SHE WOULD WANT ME
TO FORGIVE YOU.

41:01.893 --> 41:03.026
<i> AND SO...</i>

41:05.664 --> 41:06.729
I...

41:07.866 --> 41:09.599
FORGIVE YOU.

41:09.601 --> 41:12.602
<i> I FORGIVE YOU.</i>
<i> I FORGIVE YOU.</i>

41:14.506 --> 41:15.972
I CAN'T-
I CAN'T.

41:18.577 --> 41:19.676
ED.

41:21.680 --> 41:22.745
(CRYING)
