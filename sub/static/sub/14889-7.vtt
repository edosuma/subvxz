[knocking]

01:44.270 --> 01:46.439
Dad, it’s good to see you.

01:46.472 --> 01:49.342
Oh, oh.
Oh, put me down.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.781
Uh, dad,
uh, this is Balki.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.883
And this is my apartment.

01:58.585 --> 02:01.454
Oh, no, no.
I didn’t hire a decorator.

02:01.487 --> 02:03.189
I did this all myself.

02:04.324 --> 02:05.592
Oh, this?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.761
This is my scrapbook.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.564
Yeah, I keep all my newspaper
articles in here.

02:10.597 --> 02:11.865
This is Volume One.

02:11.898 --> 02:14.701
Volume Two is, uh,
still being bound.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.871
Hmm? Oh.
Oh, yeah, the trophies.

02:17.904 --> 02:19.706
Yeah, well,
they’re really starting to...

02:21.908 --> 02:23.777
...stack up, aren’t they?

02:23.810 --> 02:27.313
Oh, this one?
Yeah, this is my pride and joy.

02:27.347 --> 02:29.650
I won this playing softball.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.952
I took a ragtag team
of rank amateurs

02:31.985 --> 02:35.355
all the way to the Park District
Softball Championship.

02:35.388 --> 02:36.523
Cousin?

02:38.692 --> 02:41.194
I hate to interrupt
your talk with your...

02:42.328 --> 02:44.565
...invisible friend...

02:44.598 --> 02:47.534
...but your‐your papa’s
going to be here any minute.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.270
Yeah, I was just practicing,
uh, what I’m gonna say to him.

02:50.303 --> 02:51.972
Oh, what a great idea.
I’ll help you.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.239
Yeah, what’s in the bag?

02:53.273 --> 02:56.309
Oh, cousin, I got...

02:56.342 --> 02:59.546
...the biggest cheese wheel
I could find.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.282
You should have seen
the cheese car I took it off of.

03:07.954 --> 03:10.490
Well, that’s great.
Dad loves a good cheese wheel.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.659
Cousin, you know what
I thought I would do?

03:12.693 --> 03:15.629
I thought I would take
this cheese wheel

03:15.662 --> 03:18.865
and‐and cut it up
into little geometric shapes.

03:18.899 --> 03:22.302
You know, uh, circles,
uh, rectangles.

03:22.335 --> 03:25.539
Maybe a trapezoid
or a rhombus.

03:25.572 --> 03:28.709
Balki, cheese wheels are always
cut in triangular wedges.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.443
Well, I beg to take issue.

03:30.476 --> 03:33.013
Balki, how many cheese wheels
have you cut in your lifetime?

03:33.046 --> 03:35.882
‐Well, eh, cousin‐‐
‐How many? How many?

03:35.916 --> 03:37.851
How many cheese wheels,
how many cheese wheels

03:37.884 --> 03:40.587
have you cut
in your lifetime?

03:43.657 --> 03:46.560
‐None.
‐None? As in zero?

03:46.593 --> 03:49.863
As in never ever have you cut
a cheese wheel in your lifetime?

03:51.598 --> 03:53.366
This would have been my first.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.971
Well, I’m from Wisconsin,
the cheese wheel state

03:58.004 --> 04:00.941
and we always cut cheese wheels
in triangular wedges.

04:00.974 --> 04:04.044
Not circles, not rectangles,
not trapezoids

04:04.077 --> 04:06.880
and never, ever, ever...

04:08.749 --> 04:10.283
...a rhombus.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.026
Cousin?

04:23.797 --> 04:24.931
Cousin...

04:25.899 --> 04:28.434
...th‐this is very disturbing.

04:28.468 --> 04:32.038
Usually geometric discussions
have a calming effect on you.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.909
I’m just a little tensed
about my dad’s visit.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.845
I want this visit to be perfect.

04:38.879 --> 04:42.448
This is my chance to show dad
I’ve made it on my own.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.317
When he sees the life
I’ve made for myself

04:44.350 --> 04:47.588
he’ll be so proud of me,
he’ll say, "Well done, son."

04:48.922 --> 04:50.724
Wh‐when I was a kid,
I used to live

04:50.757 --> 04:52.626
for a "well done, son."

04:53.960 --> 04:57.397
‐I never got one.
‐Oh!

04:57.430 --> 05:00.033
Except for the one time I asked
dad how he wanted his steak.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.669
[knock on door]

05:02.703 --> 05:05.005
Oh, that must be dad.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.372
Woo.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.378
This is it.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.650
‐Dad.
‐Lawrence.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.522
It is good to see you, son.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.056
Good to see you too, dad.

05:23.089 --> 05:24.424
Well, this is for you.

05:24.457 --> 05:27.661
A genuine
Wisconsin cheese wheel.

05:27.694 --> 05:29.462
Don’t cut it
into triangular wedges.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.565
It dries out.

05:31.598 --> 05:34.768
Right you are, dad.
Uh, dad, this is Balki.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.737
Balki.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.872
Uncle Walter.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.708
Uncle Walter, I’ve been looking
forward to‐to seeing you

05:41.742 --> 05:43.376
for a sheepdog’s age.

05:43.409 --> 05:45.478
And you’re everything
I thought you would be.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.548
Only taller.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.916
Well, uh,
height runs in the family.

05:51.484 --> 05:52.753
Usually.

05:55.088 --> 05:58.925
Well, so, dad, uh, what do you
think, uh, of my apartment?

05:58.959 --> 06:00.661
Well...

06:00.694 --> 06:02.395
Hope you didn’t hire
a decorator.

06:02.428 --> 06:04.130
Oh, no, I didn’t hire
a decorator.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.099
I did this all my‐myself.

06:12.438 --> 06:15.375
[instrumental music]

06:17.443 --> 06:18.679
Where do you want
these snacks, Larry?

06:18.712 --> 06:19.813
On the dining room table.

06:19.846 --> 06:22.015
Uh, finger food
goes on the coffee table.

06:23.449 --> 06:24.450
Good point, dad.

06:24.484 --> 06:26.587
Finger food goes
on the coffee table, Jennifer.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.425
Excuse me, Lawrence.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.761
Ladies, let me show you
the Appleton method

06:34.795 --> 06:35.829
of folding napkins.

06:35.862 --> 06:38.532
I can show you
the threefold star

06:38.565 --> 06:40.901
’or the Appleton tulip.
Neither aren’t easy...’

06:40.934 --> 06:43.970
Cousin, I bet
your papa will say it

06:44.004 --> 06:46.540
when he tastes your onion dip.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.642
Say what?

06:48.675 --> 06:51.077
Well done, son.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.880
Oh, Balki, I’m sure he’ll say it
when I deserve it.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.549
He doesn’t just throw
around well dones

06:55.582 --> 06:57.551
for‐for the heck of it.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.553
Well, you know, cousin,
I‐I’ve noticed

06:59.586 --> 07:01.087
he is rather thrifty

07:01.121 --> 07:03.489
with his "well done,
sons" and...

07:04.791 --> 07:08.862
...so generous with his
"not that way, Lawrences."

07:10.864 --> 07:13.233
He’s just being helpful.
Dad’s great that way.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.801
He spots what I’m doing wrong

07:14.835 --> 07:16.903
and shows me
how to do it his way.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.874
Like, like the same way
you help me.

07:20.907 --> 07:21.975
Exactly.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.978
Come on.
Let’s go sit down.

07:26.813 --> 07:29.049
You must be very proud
of Larry, Mr. Appleton.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.084
You know, "The Chronicle"
doesn’t pick just anybody

07:31.117 --> 07:33.219
for its Investigative Reporting
team.

07:33.253 --> 07:36.557
Oh, I was very impressed
with that.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.059
‐You were?
‐Oh, you bet.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.827
Of course,
when it comes to reporting

07:40.861 --> 07:42.796
television’s the place to be.

07:44.665 --> 07:47.534
Television, right.
Thanks for the advice, dad.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.870
Well, I try. After all,
what’s a father for?

07:51.171 --> 07:54.174
You know, my father
was for higher mutton prices.

07:56.843 --> 07:59.580
I just remember all the fun
I had with my father.

07:59.613 --> 08:00.947
He used to take me everywhere.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.817
To the lake, to the golf course,
to ball games.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.852
Oh, I did the same thing
with Lawrence.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.689
Do you remember that time
the Yankees played the White Sox

08:08.722 --> 08:10.223
and we drove down to Chicago?

08:10.256 --> 08:13.560
I got us box seats
right behind the Yankee dugout?

08:13.594 --> 08:14.961
How could I forget?

08:14.995 --> 08:17.163
I still have the bat
Mickey Mantle autographed.

08:17.197 --> 08:20.667
[chuckles]
We had such fun that day.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.903
It wasn’t Mickey Mantle.
It was Roger Maris.

08:22.936 --> 08:26.707
Oh, remember the time I took you
to the circus in Milwaukee?

08:26.740 --> 08:28.775
Oh, I love the circus.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.712
Show me 50 clowns
in a flaming Volkswagen

08:31.745 --> 08:34.246
and I’m a happy Mypiot.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.717
Uh, dad.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.052
It was Mickey Mantle.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.220
’A‐and I can prove it.’

08:40.253 --> 08:42.856
I have the bat
right here in the closet.

08:42.889 --> 08:43.990
Uh...

08:45.258 --> 08:48.228
Cousin, cousin,
the bat’s in the basement.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.462
No, Balki,
the bat’s in the closet.

08:49.495 --> 08:52.165
‐The bat’s in the basement.
‐The bat’s in the closet.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.100
The bat’s in the basement.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.802
The bat’s in the closet.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.740
[rattling]

09:03.076 --> 09:04.745
The bat’s in the basement.

09:07.180 --> 09:11.351
Lawrence, it doesn’t matter
who signed the bat.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.620
Let’s get ready for the party.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.221
But it was Roger Maris.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.258
Mickey Mantle.

09:18.291 --> 09:21.261
Dad, uh, you taught me
that being right is important

09:21.294 --> 09:23.096
and I’m right about this.

09:23.129 --> 09:26.099
Alright, let’s go down
to the basement and find out.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.737
Good idea, uh, if anybody comes
while we’re gone

09:30.771 --> 09:32.806
just tell ’em
we’ll be right back.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.641
Come on, Balki,
you seem to be the only one

09:34.675 --> 09:36.109
who knows where this bat is.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.647
Lawrence, I remember it
distinctly.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.917
Roger Maris was standing by the
dugout. You didn’t even see him.

09:43.950 --> 09:46.953
I had to tell you, "Have
Roger Maris sign your bat."

09:46.987 --> 09:48.822
‐Mickey Mantle.
‐Roger Maris.

09:48.855 --> 09:49.890
‐Mickey Mantle.
‐Roger Maris.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.357
‐Mickey Mantle.
‐Roger Maris.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.959
Tastes great. Less filling.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.595
Tastes great. Less filling.

09:56.162 --> 09:58.098
I just got caught up
in the rhythm.

10:01.668 --> 10:02.969
Alright, here it is.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.238
‐Roger Maris, right?
‐No.

10:08.274 --> 10:11.878
‐"Joey Dolan."
‐Who’s Joey Dolan?

10:11.912 --> 10:14.047
Look, he‐he autographed
the ball too.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.382
"Joey Dolan, bat boy."

10:18.051 --> 10:20.654
You thought the bat boy
was Roger Maris?

10:22.122 --> 10:24.257
No, I thought the bat boy
was Mickey Mantle.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.128
I thought the bat boy
was Batman’s son.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.333
It’s an easy mistake, son.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.101
Baseball never was your sport.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.337
Oh, I don’t know about that.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.807
Cousin Larry knows an awful lot
about baseball.

10:40.841 --> 10:45.045
He taught me how to swing
this old hickory stick

10:45.078 --> 10:47.981
so I could just knock
that horsehide

10:48.014 --> 10:50.350
right into the next county.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.919
You show a lot
of natural ability, Balki.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.822
Oh, thank you, Uncle Walter.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.691
But whoever taught you
that stance

10:57.724 --> 10:59.159
didn’t know what he was doing.

11:00.794 --> 11:04.698
I taught him that stance,
and you taught it to me.

11:04.731 --> 11:07.701
Here, you‐you crouch
like Stan Musial

11:07.734 --> 11:09.803
squint like Ted Williams

11:09.836 --> 11:11.805
stride like Mickey Mantle.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.308
Swing like Grandma Moses.

11:17.410 --> 11:21.047
Well, you know, dad, I’ve done
pretty well with that swing.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.449
To prove it, I’ve got
that trophy on my mantel.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.085
‐Maris.
‐Mantel.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.153
‐Maris.
‐Mantel. Will you stop it?

11:29.122 --> 11:32.759
Uh, no offense, son,
but with that swing

11:32.793 --> 11:35.028
I’ll bet even I could throw
the ball by you.

11:36.763 --> 11:38.765
Well, there’s a ball
right there.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.867
If you feel lucky, dad,
let’s see what you can do.

11:42.503 --> 11:44.070
You’re on.

11:52.478 --> 11:55.949
‐Oh, you know, cousin, I‐‐
‐Balki, Balki, Balki, Balki.

11:55.982 --> 11:56.817
‐’Yes.’
‐You can bat next.

11:56.850 --> 11:57.984
‐Oh, no, that’s nothing.
‐’Balki.’

11:58.018 --> 11:59.052
‐I want to tell you something‐‐
‐’Balki, Balki‐‐’

11:59.085 --> 12:01.788
Let me just tell you something.
Cousin, cousin.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.223
Get out of the way.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.725
’Get out of the way.’

12:09.295 --> 12:11.231
Okay. Here it comes.

Nothing fancy. Just smoke.

‐Balki.

12:15.368 --> 12:18.004
‐Just let me say something‐‐
‐Balki. Balki. Balki.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.472
‐One thing.
‐Later.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.141
Let her rip, dad.

12:32.452 --> 12:33.887
[clanking]

12:46.567 --> 12:48.234
What did you wanna say, Balki?

12:48.268 --> 12:49.970
‐Well, I wanted to say...
‐Hmm...

12:50.003 --> 12:51.972
"Cousin Larry,
you’re standing too close

12:52.005 --> 12:53.039
to the water pipe."

12:53.073 --> 12:55.909
But now,
that seems rather obvious.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.215
Oh, I don’t think
it’s very serious.

13:02.248 --> 13:03.950
Just a simple repair job.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.285
Oh, God.

13:07.253 --> 13:09.255
Well, we better go tell
the janitor anyway.

‐Cousin, I would love to.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.552
But there’s one
little difficulty.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.621
The door is locked.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.155
We can’t get out.

It’s no use.
The door’s solid.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.429
No one can hear us.

14:23.463 --> 14:24.531
Don’t worry, Lawrence.

14:24.565 --> 14:27.901
You’ve gotten us
into bigger jams than this one.

14:27.934 --> 14:29.435
If we don’t come back,
Jennifer and Mary Anne

14:29.469 --> 14:32.172
will come down and let us out,
so there’s no harm done.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.075
Well, you know, I think we can
count on some water damage.

14:36.943 --> 14:39.379
No problem, all we have to do
to stop the leak

14:39.412 --> 14:42.348
is turn off the valve.
Presto, no more leak.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.351
Oh, I’ll do it, dad.

14:51.424 --> 14:52.659
[grunting]

14:56.462 --> 14:58.298
It‐it‐it won’t turn, dad.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.166
Well, no wonder, it’s rusted.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.536
And how do we get rid
of rust, son?

15:02.569 --> 15:04.137
We knock it off with a hammer.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.573
‐Right.
‐I’ll get one.

‐Uh, U‐Uncle Walter.
‐Yes.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.580
Hitting it with a hammer?

15:13.614 --> 15:16.049
Doesn’t that seem
like a‐a rather violent way

15:16.082 --> 15:17.551
to deal with rust?

15:17.584 --> 15:20.521
‐Oh, you think so?
‐Yes, I do.

15:20.554 --> 15:22.288
Tell me, Balki.

15:22.322 --> 15:25.291
How many leaks have you
fixed in your lifetime?

15:27.594 --> 15:29.062
‐Uh...
‐How many?

15:29.095 --> 15:30.564
‐Well...
‐How many?

15:30.597 --> 15:33.199
How many leaks,
how many leaks

15:33.233 --> 15:36.703
have you fixed
in your lifetime?

15:36.737 --> 15:38.038
Um...

15:39.172 --> 15:42.242
‐None.
‐None? As in zero?

15:42.275 --> 15:46.412
As in never ever have you fixed
a leak in your lifetime?

15:48.448 --> 15:49.482
‐That is correct.
‐Oh!

15:49.516 --> 15:53.253
You see, I’ve always worked
with an Appleton.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.122
Let’s listen to dad, Balki.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.058
He taught me everything
I know about plumbing.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.492
That’s what worries me.

16:03.764 --> 16:05.365
We’re in good hands.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.636
Dad uses tools like a surgeon.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.483
Looks like the surgeon
lost a patient.

16:30.090 --> 16:33.193
And then, after Larry’s father
separated the crackers

16:33.226 --> 16:35.596
by size, shape, and flavor...

16:35.629 --> 16:37.631
...he counted the toothpicks

16:37.664 --> 16:40.601
separating the round ones
from the flat ones.

16:40.634 --> 16:41.735
’Anyway, next he and Larry got’

16:41.768 --> 16:43.403
into some fight
about a silly bat

16:43.436 --> 16:45.205
and they went down
to the basement to find it.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.272
Where are they?

16:46.306 --> 16:47.340
It shouldn’t take this long

16:47.373 --> 16:48.474
to find a baseball bat.

16:48.509 --> 16:51.177
You’ve got two compulsives
and an idiot down there.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.213
For all we know, they could
be tunneling to China.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.748

16:57.483 --> 16:59.319
I think I’ll‐I’ll go downstairs

16:59.352 --> 17:00.721
and see what’s taking them
so long.

17:00.754 --> 17:02.756
Well, tell them not to hurry
on my account.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.730
Let’s analyze the problem.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.765
What is causing the flooding?

17:13.567 --> 17:14.734
Balki.

17:15.769 --> 17:18.571
My guess would be...water.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.208
Good, Balki, good.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.644
Alright. Let’s think.

17:27.681 --> 17:31.585
‐All basements have drains.
‐Right.

17:31.618 --> 17:34.354
But the water isn’t running off.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.490
Which means a stopped up drain.

17:38.559 --> 17:40.226
Right.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.728
You are listening to the master.

17:41.762 --> 17:43.363
Shh. Shh.
I’m listening.

17:45.165 --> 17:48.368
All we have to do is find it,
free it

17:48.401 --> 17:50.403

17:50.436 --> 17:51.705
Lawrence, you look over there.
