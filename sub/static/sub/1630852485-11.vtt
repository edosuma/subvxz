Well, let's try to keep
your voice down, ma'am.

00:50.442 --> 00:52.700
Susie, I need to know where
in the house the closet is

00:52.720 --> 00:54.202

is a heavily armed meth-head.

is filled with gasoline.

09:11.276 --> 09:12.867
I'm not rage punching.

09:12.886 --> 09:13.943
(doorbell rings)

09:13.962 --> 09:15.387
TK:
Thank God, there's the bell.

09:15.538 --> 09:16.946
Round's over.

09:16.965 --> 09:18.682
You gonna get that, Raging Bull?

09:19.301 --> 09:20.725
(panting)

09:21.803 --> 09:23.395
Not raging.

09:25.214 --> 09:27.882
-Hey. Hey.
-Grace. Hey.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.142
Can I come in?

09:29.218 --> 09:31.194
CARLOS:
Yes. I'm sorry. Come in. Yeah.

09:32.631 --> 09:34.814
-Hi, TK.
-Hey, you.

09:34.891 --> 09:36.241
Oh, am I interrupting lunch?

09:36.392 --> 09:39.302
Oh, no, this isn't lunch.
He eats, like, six times a day.

09:39.321 --> 09:40.704
Did something happen?

09:41.397 --> 09:42.414
(sighs)

09:43.491 --> 09:45.041
Yeah, Carlos.

09:46.494 --> 09:48.420
We got played.

09:48.571 --> 09:50.255
That's what happened.

09:50.332 --> 09:52.382
And I don't know
about you, but...

09:53.076 --> 09:54.718
I'm angry about it.

09:55.411 --> 09:56.595
Yeah.

09:58.173 --> 09:59.764
I'm frustrated, too.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.938
GRACE:
Yeah, but I didn't say
I was frustrated, Carlos.

10:07.015 --> 10:08.690
I said I was angry.

10:10.426 --> 10:13.111
I'm furious.
I'm-I'm pissed off about it.

10:13.262 --> 10:14.354
TK:
Oh, he's pissed, Grace.

10:14.472 --> 10:16.114
GRACE:
Yeah, he should be.

10:16.265 --> 10:18.450
We were played for some fools...

10:19.286 --> 10:20.785
and a man is dead 'cause of it.

10:20.862 --> 10:25.348
Yeah, okay.
I guess I'm kind of
pissed off about that.

10:25.367 --> 10:28.168
You realize that this wasn't
your fault, right?

10:29.946 --> 10:33.632
Yeah, that's... that's what
I keep trying to tell myself.

10:35.861 --> 10:36.968
Well, good.

10:38.363 --> 10:40.046
Good, because
I'm telling you, too.

10:40.198 --> 10:42.882
This was not on you or me.

10:43.034 --> 10:44.142
(sighs)

10:44.293 --> 10:46.627
Then why does it
feel like it is?

10:46.705 --> 10:49.147
Because somebody came
and took our power away.

10:49.298 --> 10:50.798
That's why it feels like this.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.725
And what are we
supposed to do about it?

10:52.878 --> 10:54.194
We take it back.

10:55.547 --> 10:57.322
Lets me and you
go out here and find out

10:57.473 --> 10:59.491
who's actually
responsible for this.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.159
'Cause it's not us.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.161
Grace, I'm...

11:03.330 --> 11:06.572
I'm on mandatory leave
from the department
while they investigate.

11:06.725 --> 11:08.892
GRACE: Okay, that's good.
That means you got some time.

11:08.894 --> 11:11.077
APD's already all over it.

11:11.229 --> 11:13.171
They got three detectives.

11:13.248 --> 11:16.733
Someone from Cyber
assigned to the case.

11:16.735 --> 11:20.161
And how many cases
do they already have, Carlos?

11:20.255 --> 11:21.587
Because I don't know about you,

11:21.740 --> 11:25.100
but this is the only meal
that I can eat right now.

11:26.428 --> 11:28.853
Grace, I'm a patrol officer,
not a detective.

11:28.930 --> 11:31.264
Yeah, says the guy who just
solved a kidnapping case.

11:31.340 --> 11:34.192
GRACE:
Carlos, you have skills...

11:34.269 --> 11:36.695
but you've also got
something else.

11:38.532 --> 11:39.572
You?

11:40.367 --> 11:41.991
You've got rage.

11:48.357 --> 11:50.750
(lively country music playing)

11:53.029 --> 11:55.422
(indistinct chatter)

11:59.110 --> 12:00.443
I like the hat.

12:00.445 --> 12:03.096
Well, you gotta have a hat
at a honky-tonk. Come on.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.641
Thanks for dragging me
out tonight.

12:07.635 --> 12:09.543
I really needed this.

12:09.621 --> 12:12.472
-Rough week at the Capitol?
-Hmm.

12:12.548 --> 12:14.974
We had to balance
the state budget.

12:15.051 --> 12:16.309
I was hoping to use a scalpel,

12:16.461 --> 12:18.219
but the governor
pulled out a machete.

12:18.296 --> 12:20.463
For what it's worth,
I once balanced a budget so well

12:20.482 --> 12:21.889
that it shut down
my own firehouse.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.909
Well, at least you didn't
go on cable news afterwards

12:25.061 --> 12:26.393
to sell the public.

12:26.488 --> 12:29.330
Yeah, I don't have
the cheekbones for prime time.

12:29.991 --> 12:31.899
Oh, I think you do.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.309
And you also have that whole

12:33.311 --> 12:36.479
John Travolta
"Midnight Cowboy" vibe.

12:36.481 --> 12:38.572
I think you mean "Urban Cowboy"?

12:38.650 --> 12:41.317
"Midnight Cowboy" is a movie
about male prostitution.

12:41.336 --> 12:42.409
-Oh.
-(pounding on table)

12:42.429 --> 12:43.928
(imitating Ratso):
"I'm walking here!"

12:44.080 --> 12:45.263
Right.

12:45.340 --> 12:47.673
I-I can never
keep those straight.

12:47.750 --> 12:48.992
Wanna dance?

12:48.994 --> 12:50.510
I d... I don't really know how.

12:50.662 --> 12:51.770
Come on, I'll teach you.

12:51.846 --> 12:53.513
Uh... I-I should warn you.

12:53.589 --> 12:55.348
I have the rhythm
of a flat tire.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.350
You don't have to have
rhythm to two-step.

12:57.426 --> 13:00.111
It's just quick-quick,
slow-slow, quick-quick.

13:00.263 --> 13:02.113
-Just follow me, you'll be fine.
-Okay.

13:02.265 --> 13:03.782

13:23.545 --> 13:25.862
Wait, you're not gonna

13:41.880 --> 13:44.989
saw me taking two-step lessons
from a New Yorker.

13:45.066 --> 13:46.991
Uh, I'm from Santa Monica,
actually.

13:47.068 --> 13:49.735
Oh, great. California.
Even better.

13:49.888 --> 13:50.662
You're from Texas,

13:50.997 --> 13:52.980
and this is the first time
you two-stepped.

13:53.058 --> 13:54.557
I never had much interest.

13:54.559 --> 13:57.410
Besides, I spent most
of my prime dancing years

13:57.562 --> 13:59.504
with my nose buried
in Con Law books

13:59.581 --> 14:01.655
and reports
on highway infrastructure.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.324
Well, from what I just saw,

14:03.401 --> 14:04.843
your prime is ahead of you.

14:04.994 --> 14:07.011
MAN: Hey. Hey.

14:08.907 --> 14:09.922
Hey, you're her.

14:09.999 --> 14:11.182
Yeah, I seen you on the news.

14:11.334 --> 14:13.434
You're the lady that works
for the governor, huh?

14:13.912 --> 14:15.687
I'm her.

14:15.914 --> 14:20.416
Yeah. You're like, uh,
like a little Ann Coulter 2.0.

14:20.435 --> 14:24.320
Except without any kinda
warmth or compassion to ya.

14:25.273 --> 14:26.756
Good one.

14:26.758 --> 14:30.017
Hey, man, I'm just trying
to have a drink with my friend.

14:30.095 --> 14:31.202
MAN: Oh, that's fine.

14:31.354 --> 14:32.278
Yeah, I'm just
over here trying to

14:32.430 --> 14:33.854
earn a living
for my family, too.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.523
Just like all the thousands
of other oilmen in this state

14:36.601 --> 14:39.785
that you and your boss
clearly don't give a damn about.

14:39.938 --> 14:41.695
Hey, pal?
She's off the clock.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.382
Hey, it's fine.
I'm used to it.

14:44.533 --> 14:47.276
My father was a roughneck
from Midland,

14:47.295 --> 14:48.887
believe me,
we care about the people

14:48.963 --> 14:50.221
who keep the lights on.

14:50.298 --> 14:51.781
Well, you sure
could have fooled me

14:51.799 --> 14:54.559
with all that
clean energy initiative B.S.

14:54.636 --> 14:57.044
Alright.
It's time for you
to mosey on.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.122
Okay, Owen, just relax.

14:59.140 --> 15:00.306
I've got this.

15:00.458 --> 15:01.882
You think you're
so smart, don't you?

15:01.902 --> 15:05.386
You can dress up
in your power suit
and your high heels

15:05.463 --> 15:07.480
and go on Fox and CNN,
but at the end of the day,

15:07.632 --> 15:09.657
you are nothing
but a smug piece of--

15:10.393 --> 15:11.984
ALL: Oh!

15:12.137 --> 15:13.411
I warned him.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.165
-You did.
-I warned him.

15:19.327 --> 15:21.402
Just be glad nobody
wanted to press charges.

15:21.421 --> 15:25.572
That's true.
And this date didn't end
in a high-speed chase.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.593
I mean, I can't decide
whether that's a step up or...

15:29.487 --> 15:30.836
a step down.

15:30.989 --> 15:32.505
I can't really tell.

15:32.581 --> 15:34.748
Oh, come on, Catherine.
You can't let some meathead

15:34.768 --> 15:36.509
ruin the whole
rest of our evening.

15:36.585 --> 15:40.104
And which meathead
would you be referring to?

15:40.181 --> 15:43.107
(scoffs)
You're talking about me?

15:43.259 --> 15:45.184
Well, why aren't you mad
at that guy?

15:45.261 --> 15:46.519
Because I don't know that guy.

15:46.671 --> 15:48.929
And I asked you
not to do anything.

15:49.007 --> 15:50.173
Twice, actually.

15:50.175 --> 15:51.524
Yes. And then
he called you something

15:51.676 --> 15:53.267
I'm not comfortable
with him calling you.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.194
Uh, who cares what
you're comfortable with?

15:55.271 --> 15:56.287
It wasn't about you.

15:56.439 --> 15:59.123
You should have just let it go,
like I said.

15:59.350 --> 16:03.019
So you'd rather have me
stand back as a coward

16:03.021 --> 16:05.296
while you're bullied by a drunk?

16:05.373 --> 16:08.524
I would rather you let me
handle my business

16:08.526 --> 16:09.634
like a grown-up.

16:09.785 --> 16:12.378
But one thing
I would definitely not rather

16:12.455 --> 16:14.714
is you sucker punching
one of my boss' constituents.

16:14.866 --> 16:17.550
Sucker punch? Oh, please.
You call that a sucker punch?

16:17.702 --> 16:19.385
Both of our shoulders
were clearly squared.

16:19.537 --> 16:23.130
(scoffs) Boy, you...
you really don't get it, do you?

16:23.132 --> 16:26.150
No, I-I get it.
I just think that...

16:26.227 --> 16:28.878
maybe your anger
is a little misplaced.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.213
Oh, go on, Owen.

16:30.306 --> 16:33.140
Please tell me more about
what I should be feeling.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.051
Do you think
this is the first time

16:35.053 --> 16:36.402
that somebody's come at me
in public?

16:36.479 --> 16:39.831
Most days vitriol comes
with my morning latte.

16:39.982 --> 16:42.149
Vitriol or spit.

16:42.227 --> 16:44.393
-Spit?
-My point is,

16:44.412 --> 16:46.337
if I didn't have
skin like rawhide,

16:46.489 --> 16:48.414
I wouldn't have this job.

16:48.566 --> 16:52.326
So I don't need you
or anyone else
to defend me, okay?

16:52.403 --> 16:53.553
Okay.

16:57.742 --> 17:00.518
I know you're in the business
of saving people...

17:01.337 --> 17:03.980
I did not ask to be saved.

17:08.086 --> 17:09.527
(door slams)

17:16.761 --> 17:19.537
-My buddy in Homicide
slipped me the case file.
-(zipper unzips)

17:19.614 --> 17:22.856
Everything they know about
the deceased Mark Poling

17:22.934 --> 17:24.617
and the investigation so far.

17:24.769 --> 17:27.027
And they're definitely
operating on the theory
it's drug-related.

17:27.121 --> 17:29.455
-Okay.
-Right now they're circling

17:29.532 --> 17:30.531
a few possibles.

17:30.550 --> 17:34.886
Amber Harris,
Mark's ex-girlfriend,

17:35.037 --> 17:37.204
Isaac "Herc" Rodriguez.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.640
He's the shot-caller
for the Rolling 7s.

17:40.376 --> 17:41.375
And Victor Gaines,

17:41.394 --> 17:45.288
he's a rival dealer
from Dove Springs.

17:45.306 --> 17:47.548
Okay. So what do we know
about these people

17:47.567 --> 17:49.883
other than the fact that
they're all frequent fliers?

17:49.961 --> 17:51.552
Amber used to deal with Mark

17:51.629 --> 17:53.554
until about a week ago
when they broke up.

17:53.631 --> 17:55.740
-Okay.
-But my buddy
doesn't like her for it.

17:55.891 --> 17:57.650
She seemed devastated
by his death.

17:57.802 --> 18:00.986
-I see.
-And Rodriguez was
in Hays County lockup

18:01.063 --> 18:02.138
the night of the incident,

18:02.140 --> 18:04.398
which makes Gaines
our lead horse.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.326
He could have had
a female accomplice
to make the call.

18:07.478 --> 18:09.754
Apparently, he and Poling
were beefing about territory.

18:09.831 --> 18:14.425
And get this, he was convicted
twice for making swatting calls.

18:14.502 --> 18:17.261
Well, you know, you could have
led with that tidbit, Carlos.

18:17.413 --> 18:19.004
Well, you know,
I like to set up the board

18:19.081 --> 18:21.140
before I utilize
the moving pieces.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.994
But just listen to these tapes.

18:24.996 --> 18:26.679
DISPATCHER 1 (over laptop):
<i> 9-1-1. What's your emergency?</i>

18:26.831 --> 18:28.806
VICTOR GAINES (over laptop):
<i> Yeah, my name's Gary Lopez.</i>

18:28.958 --> 18:30.333
<i> 5-2-2-6 Howard Drive.</i>

18:30.351 --> 18:31.667
DISPATCHER 1:
<i> What's going on, Gary?</i>

18:31.669 --> 18:32.610
GAINES:<i> What's going on</i>

18:32.761 --> 18:34.170
<i>is my wife is a cheating whore,</i>

18:34.172 --> 18:35.671
<i> and I want</i>
<i> the whole world to know it.</i>

18:35.690 --> 18:38.098
<i> That's why I have to blow</i>
<i> her freakin' brains out!</i>

18:38.176 --> 18:39.784
-(stops audio)
-Officers stormed the house,

18:39.935 --> 18:41.861
found Gary Lopez taking a nap

18:42.013 --> 18:42.954
next to his boyfriend.

18:43.105 --> 18:45.381
And five kilos of weed.

18:45.383 --> 18:46.791
-Can you play
the next one for me?
-Mm-hmm.

18:46.868 --> 18:49.127
DISPATCHER 2 (over laptop):
<i> 9-1-1, what's your emergency?</i>

18:49.320 --> 18:50.461
GAINES:<i> My girlfriend's</i>
<i> a cheating skank</i>

18:50.538 --> 18:52.463
<i> and I'm gonna blow</i>
<i> her freakin' brains out!</i>

18:52.615 --> 18:54.707
DISPATCHER 2:<i> Hold on, sir.</i>
<i> Can you tell me where you are?</i>

18:54.783 --> 18:56.950
-(stops audio)
-Gaines is
a one-trick pony, Carlos.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.469
Yeah, not exactly Pacino, is he?

18:58.621 --> 19:01.055
Where did it say
he made those calls from?

19:06.295 --> 19:07.478
CARLOS:
From pay phones.

19:07.630 --> 19:10.222
I didn't even know
pay phones were still a thing.

19:10.299 --> 19:11.983
Our caller spoofed
their IP address,

19:12.134 --> 19:13.392
bounced the call across,

19:13.544 --> 19:15.378
I don't know,
three different servers.

19:15.396 --> 19:16.988
And they gave
an award-winning performance

19:17.139 --> 19:18.472
with a baby crying on cue.

19:18.566 --> 19:21.050
Doesn't seem like they're
in the same league, does it?

19:21.052 --> 19:22.493
No.

19:22.645 --> 19:25.145
Alright, hon, I just
put Charlie down.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.647
I'm headin' to work.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.723
Okay, babe. You be safe.

19:27.725 --> 19:29.333
How's the gumshoeing going?

19:29.410 --> 19:31.335
It's all gum and no shoe
right now.

19:31.487 --> 19:33.320
It looks like
we just ran out of suspects.

19:33.398 --> 19:36.065
Drug angle is a bust.

19:36.067 --> 19:37.991
Y'all tried the gaming angle?

19:38.011 --> 19:39.251
There's a gaming angle?

19:39.420 --> 19:41.495
The guy was playing "Dread Ops"
when we went in there

19:41.572 --> 19:43.422
with a top-of-the-line
gaming rig

19:43.574 --> 19:45.850
and, you know, camera
for streaming and everything.

19:45.927 --> 19:49.687
You think someone would swat
Mark's house over a video game?

19:49.764 --> 19:52.839
People talk all kinds of trash
about rival streamers.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.008
It gets, uh, pretty nasty,

19:55.028 --> 19:58.362
especially if you got
a few thousand people
watching but...

19:59.590 --> 20:00.698
not when it's your boy, though.

20:00.849 --> 20:02.258
Hmm. Says a man

20:02.260 --> 20:04.518
that once threw a controller
through our flat screen.

20:04.595 --> 20:06.687
No, I told you it was
a slip of my wrist, but...

20:06.764 --> 20:08.948
What did you say
the name of the game was?

20:09.024 --> 20:10.282
JUDD: "Dread Ops."

20:10.435 --> 20:14.103
If you picture an open sewer
filled with trolls.

20:14.121 --> 20:15.696
"Dread Ops."

20:15.773 --> 20:16.772
(door opens)

20:16.941 --> 20:19.108
Looks like it's time
to go play in the sewer.

20:19.126 --> 20:20.551
(door closes)

20:26.300 --> 20:28.208
Hey, Paul, what are you up to?

20:28.286 --> 20:30.636
Alphabetizing the spice rack.

20:30.713 --> 20:32.972
Why would you alphabetize
a spice rack?

20:33.124 --> 20:34.974
To organize it?

20:35.050 --> 20:36.383
It was organized.

20:36.477 --> 20:37.401
Okay, then why did I find

20:37.553 --> 20:39.052
the coriander
next to the za'atar?

20:39.072 --> 20:42.465
Because I organize mine
by flavor profile.

20:42.483 --> 20:45.243
Those two are staples
of Mediterranean cooking.

20:45.394 --> 20:47.653
Flavor profile?
Come on, Cap.
That is not a thing.

20:47.805 --> 20:49.488
You know, Paul, when you
came back for desk duty,

20:49.565 --> 20:52.416
I pictured you behind more of,
I don't know, like a desk.

20:52.568 --> 20:54.252
I've been sitting around
all morning.

20:54.328 --> 20:55.902
Already collated
all the incident reports,

20:55.922 --> 20:58.147
and submitted
all the house billings
for the next month.

20:58.165 --> 20:59.982
I was antsy
to do something physical.

21:00.001 --> 21:01.908
Good. Then you can help me
put my spices back.

21:01.986 --> 21:03.319
Copy that.

21:03.321 --> 21:05.671
So, togarashis and galangals...

21:05.748 --> 21:06.580
go back over here.

21:06.824 --> 21:09.100
Whoa, Cap, what happened
to your hand?

21:09.176 --> 21:10.342
Oh, I think I bumped it.

21:10.495 --> 21:12.161
Probably on that swatting call.

21:12.179 --> 21:13.920
Bumped it?
You sure you didn't break it?

21:13.998 --> 21:15.164
No, I didn't break it.

21:15.166 --> 21:16.423
-Captain Vega?
-TOMMY: Yeah.

21:16.442 --> 21:17.591
PAUL: Will you please
come here and take a look

21:17.685 --> 21:19.168
-at Cap Strand's hand?
-No, no, no, no, no.

21:19.170 --> 21:21.337
That is
completely unnecessary.

21:21.355 --> 21:23.030
Okay, let's see it, Owen.

21:24.025 --> 21:26.158
Owen, let me see it.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.103
Oh.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.348
-Can you make a fist for me?
-Yes.

21:32.366 --> 21:34.350
Are you sure that's not
exactly how this happened?

21:34.352 --> 21:37.686
Just you making a fist
into somebody's face?

21:37.705 --> 21:39.297
PAUL: Captain Strand,
please tell me Billy Tyson

21:39.373 --> 21:41.465
is not walking around
with a black eye right now.

21:41.692 --> 21:42.525
No.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.135
I'll have you know
that I did this

21:44.286 --> 21:46.028
defending my lady's honor

21:46.030 --> 21:47.120
at a honky-tonk last night.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.031
Oh, snap.
You went all John Wayne

21:49.033 --> 21:50.366
with some drunk redneck
in a bar?

21:50.384 --> 21:51.976
The guy was like
completely out of line.

21:52.127 --> 21:54.370
And then Catherine blamed me.

21:54.372 --> 21:55.220
What? Why?

21:55.297 --> 21:56.814
She said if she wanted

21:56.965 --> 21:58.557
somebody to rescue her,

21:58.634 --> 21:59.734
she would have asked.

22:00.545 --> 22:01.819
TOMMY: Oh, well.

22:01.970 --> 22:04.380
I can understand that.

22:04.398 --> 22:07.216
Of course, you can.
See, this is why

22:07.218 --> 22:09.476
nobody opens doors
for anybody anymore.

22:09.495 --> 22:10.977
Well, I'm... I'm sorry.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.330
I'm just surprised that,

22:12.481 --> 22:15.407
well, such a progressive man
as yourself

22:15.560 --> 22:18.410
would have such a,
a traditional take on this.

22:18.563 --> 22:21.564
Ooh, no, no.
Don't hit me with traditional.

22:21.582 --> 22:24.658
I'm not some old school,
you know, Dirty Harry

22:24.735 --> 22:27.720
who's just gonna roll up
and punch somebody in the face.

22:29.331 --> 22:32.424
I guess that is me.
How do I fix this?

22:32.501 --> 22:34.927
Flowers and chocolate.
Those always work.

22:35.003 --> 22:36.595
Oh, that's not traditional?

22:36.747 --> 22:38.981
Some traditions never die.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.101
It's official.

22:42.195 --> 22:45.363
-I will never understand women.
-Amen, brother.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.372
Bill, I doubt the governor
will be interested

22:54.523 --> 22:56.707
in giving a quote to the paper
that called him,

22:56.859 --> 22:58.209
what was it?

22:58.360 --> 23:03.029
"A bloated old steer bellowing
to be put out to pasture"?

23:03.107 --> 23:04.273
I know it's not your fault.

23:04.275 --> 23:05.674
(whispering):
Catherine Harper?

23:06.460 --> 23:07.459
Uh, that's me.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.294
I'm not even saying
it's not funny.

23:09.447 --> 23:12.131
Excuse me.
These came for you.

23:12.283 --> 23:15.059
Oh. Uh, right here's fine.
Thank you.

23:16.712 --> 23:18.562
I know it's your beat though.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.624
Tell you what.

23:21.626 --> 23:24.460
Give us some love
on his new tax cuts

23:24.478 --> 23:25.978
for small businesses tomorrow

23:26.130 --> 23:29.890
and... I'll see what I can do.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.159
Hi to Rosie and the boys.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.086
Oh, my God.
Oh, God!

23:42.163 --> 23:44.046
Oh, my God.

23:56.327 --> 23:59.353
-(wailing)
-(horn blares)

24:04.518 --> 24:06.426
OWEN: How many people
still in the Capitol?

24:06.504 --> 24:07.853
HOWARD:
It's mostly evacuated now.

24:08.005 --> 24:08.612
TOMMY:
Is the governor
still on-site?

24:08.764 --> 24:09.780
Thank God, no.

24:09.932 --> 24:11.340
And the state legislature
is in recess.

24:11.342 --> 24:12.675
What can you tell us
about the white powder?

24:12.677 --> 24:14.285
According to the victim,
she was hit with it

24:14.361 --> 24:15.861
when she opened
a greeting card.

24:15.938 --> 24:16.770
Has the FBI been notified?

24:16.789 --> 24:17.621
HOWARD: And the CDC.

24:17.698 --> 24:19.181
Their mobile lab is en route.

24:19.183 --> 24:20.365
The greeting card?

24:20.442 --> 24:21.366
Came with a flower delivery.

24:21.519 --> 24:22.460
Well, do you know
who delivered it?

24:22.611 --> 24:24.203
Anyone who touched it
risks exposure.

24:24.355 --> 24:25.445
A mail room employee.

24:25.539 --> 24:27.039
Miss Harper said
she'd never seen it before.

24:27.191 --> 24:29.041
-We're looking for him.
-Catherine Harper?

24:29.193 --> 24:30.709
The governor's
chief of staff, yeah.

24:30.861 --> 24:31.785
Nice lady.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.529
She's self-isolating
in her office.

24:33.547 --> 24:35.214
TOMMY:
Has she reported any symptoms?

24:35.308 --> 24:37.199
-HOWARD: Not yet.
-Okay, 126.

24:37.218 --> 24:38.625
CDC is gonna want us
to take samples.

24:38.703 --> 24:40.886
The sooner we do that,
the sooner they know what it is,

24:41.038 --> 24:41.812
the sooner we can help people.

24:41.964 --> 24:43.038
Alright, full hazmat suits,

24:43.040 --> 24:44.815
seal every seal, every zipper.

24:44.967 --> 24:46.299
Some of these powders,

24:46.319 --> 24:47.968
a pinprick of 'em
will kill you.

24:48.062 --> 24:49.153
So there's no margin
for error here.

24:49.304 --> 24:50.395
We'll keep it
nice and tight, Cap.

24:50.397 --> 24:51.697
OWEN: Alright, let's do it.

24:53.567 --> 24:55.701
(tense music playing)

24:58.664 --> 25:00.331
AFD!

25:02.168 --> 25:04.059
(breathes heavily)

25:04.078 --> 25:06.337
-Owen?
-Hey.

25:06.564 --> 25:09.489
I'd like to say
it's good to see you, but, um...

25:09.567 --> 25:11.300
it's kinda not.

25:12.678 --> 25:14.570
We're gonna
take care of ya.

25:15.831 --> 25:19.908
-Is that the note?
-Yeah, it came
with the flowers.

25:19.927 --> 25:22.102
I thought maybe you sent them.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.564
-I didn't.
-No.

25:27.101 --> 25:29.026
I-I can feel it on my skin...

25:29.845 --> 25:31.362
inside my lungs.

25:33.090 --> 25:34.532
I breathed it in, Owen.

25:34.942 --> 25:36.408
I know.

25:38.112 --> 25:40.946
Judd, why don't you
bag the note for a sample?

25:41.098 --> 25:42.856
-Swab her.
-JUDD: You got it, Cap.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.601
-OWEN: Marjan,
set up a decon shower.
-I'm on it.

25:45.661 --> 25:47.694
OWEN: We need to seal
this whole area off.

25:47.713 --> 25:50.773
Needs to be completely airtight.

25:50.775 --> 25:52.716
JUDD:
Please open up for me, ma'am.

25:54.369 --> 25:56.136
Okay. Thank you so much.

25:57.298 --> 25:59.782
This is Tommy.
She's gonna assess you.

25:59.800 --> 26:03.060
Hey, Catherine. I'm just gonna
check you out real quick.

26:05.231 --> 26:08.290
How long before
we find out what this is?

26:08.292 --> 26:10.050
You have to take
all that to a lab?

26:10.069 --> 26:12.027
Lab's coming to us, actually.

I had never seen him before,

27:55.749 --> 27:58.759
Well, you thought the flowers

28:00.754 --> 28:02.587
The card said...

28:02.664 --> 28:04.907
"Now you're really toxic,"

Look, we don't know

There's no reason

I need to know.

28:27.781 --> 28:30.749
(stammers)
I can handle it, Owen.

28:34.362 --> 28:36.213
Based on the way
that it aerosolized,

28:36.364 --> 28:39.758
we could be looking at
anthrax or ricin.

28:42.704 --> 28:43.971
Okay.

28:44.965 --> 28:47.224
What are the symptoms?

28:47.375 --> 28:51.211
If it's anthrax, you'll get
a fever, muscle aches,

28:51.230 --> 28:53.213

for making a swatting call

38:04.341 --> 38:06.341
to Mark Poling of Austin, Texas.

38:06.343 --> 38:08.118
Also for fraud, conspiracy...

38:08.269 --> 38:10.269
-Ow!
-...and murder.

38:10.347 --> 38:11.437
What? It was just a joke.

38:11.515 --> 38:12.622
It was just a joke!

38:12.958 --> 38:16.668
Not as much fun when SWAT comes
knocking at your door, is it?

38:23.785 --> 38:25.209
(siren wails)

38:25.286 --> 38:26.136
CARLOS (over phone):
<i> Wait, you got him?</i>

38:26.287 --> 38:28.513
Oh, yeah, we got him.

38:29.866 --> 38:31.049
Derrick's girlfriend
flipped on him

38:31.143 --> 38:32.884
faster than a beachfront condo.

38:33.036 --> 38:36.962
<i> She said they've been</i>
<i> making swatting calls</i>
<i> all over the country.</i>

38:37.040 --> 38:38.464
<i> These gamers play dirty.</i>

38:38.483 --> 38:40.817
-Ah.
-So does that mean that
was her voice on the call?

38:40.894 --> 38:42.043
Oh, yeah.

38:42.062 --> 38:43.486
She's an aspiring actress.

38:43.488 --> 38:46.214
I think she may have gotten
her first agent today.

38:46.216 --> 38:48.700
<i> Of course, he'll be</i>
<i> working for the FBI.</i>

38:48.735 --> 38:49.884
What about the baby?

38:50.053 --> 38:52.236
They recorded some sounds
from the Internet.

38:52.313 --> 38:54.313
<i> Yeah, they got quite</i>
<i> the little home studio here.</i>

38:54.391 --> 38:56.057
Wow. Sergeant Grant, we...

38:56.059 --> 38:57.316
we really can't
thank you enough.

38:57.394 --> 38:58.560
<i> Seriously, you have no idea</i>

38:58.578 --> 39:00.228
<i> how much this means</i>
<i> to the both of us.</i>

39:00.230 --> 39:02.246
You guys did
all the hard work.

39:02.399 --> 39:04.632
I just showed up
for the fun, Detective.

39:05.919 --> 39:07.251
I'm not a detective,
actually.

39:07.404 --> 39:09.087
You're kiddin'?
You could have fooled me.

39:09.181 --> 39:10.738
Nope, just a patrol officer.

39:10.757 --> 39:14.576
There's no such thing
as just a patrol officer, son.

39:14.578 --> 39:16.502
Folks in Austin
are lucky to have

39:16.521 --> 39:18.429
the both of y'all
looking out for them.

39:18.582 --> 39:20.081
<i> Well, listen,</i>
<i> if you are ever in town,</i>

39:20.100 --> 39:21.340
<i> we'd love to</i>
<i> meet you in person.</i>

39:21.360 --> 39:23.585
<i> Well, I would like that.</i>

39:23.603 --> 39:27.255
I'm sorry. Sergeant Grant,
is that our suspect behind you?

39:27.257 --> 39:28.365
Yeah, it is.

39:28.533 --> 39:31.109
You mind if we say hey
before they transport him?

39:31.261 --> 39:33.111
GRANT:
<i> I think that can be arranged.</i>

39:33.263 --> 39:34.854
Just wanna say hey.

39:34.948 --> 39:36.280
GRANT:<i> Here he is.</i>

39:36.433 --> 39:39.209
Derrick, say hello
to my friends Grace and Carlos.

39:39.360 --> 39:41.861
They're the reason your dumb ass
is in handcuffs today.

39:41.880 --> 39:45.698
And they didn't have to
get off their couch to do it.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.126
You know, I just had
to admit, Derrick, you, uh,

39:48.278 --> 39:50.169
you really had me fooled.

39:50.280 --> 39:52.538
You had me question myself
for the first time.

39:52.616 --> 39:54.782
<i> You were clever.</i>
<i> I didn't think we'd catch you.</i>

39:54.784 --> 39:56.284
You got lucky.

39:56.286 --> 39:57.877
<i> Oh, no, sir. It wasn't luck.</i>

39:57.879 --> 39:59.729
<i> I can tell you</i>
<i> what it was, though.</i>

40:01.066 --> 40:02.306
<i> It was God's plan, bitch.</i>

40:02.459 --> 40:04.809
-(Grant laughs)
-(laughs, coughs)

40:04.961 --> 40:06.310
<i> I like her.</i>

40:06.463 --> 40:07.570
Me, too.

40:13.895 --> 40:14.994
How are you feeling?

40:16.063 --> 40:17.247
Good.

40:17.398 --> 40:20.158
This is a lot easier
than the two-step.

40:20.234 --> 40:21.309
It's easier on my toes.

40:21.327 --> 40:23.903
(soft chuckle)
Shut up.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.330
You sure you don't wanna
get our act back together?

40:26.407 --> 40:27.406
We could take it on the road.

40:27.426 --> 40:28.499
There are plenty of honky-tonks

40:28.652 --> 40:30.242
that I haven't been
trespassed outta.

40:30.262 --> 40:34.097
Oh. I think we should
stay inside tonight.

40:34.248 --> 40:36.015
-Yeah.
-Feels safer.

40:37.661 --> 40:38.560
It's safe in here.

40:39.496 --> 40:42.439
Oh, I wasn't talking about me.

40:42.590 --> 40:44.849
I just can't risk
you punching out

40:45.001 --> 40:47.694
any more Travis County voters.

40:48.763 --> 40:50.596
I feel like
I'm doing them a service

40:50.598 --> 40:52.490
by keeping you indoors.

40:53.526 --> 40:56.027
Has anyone ever told you
you might have

40:56.103 --> 40:58.346
a slight
anger management problem?

40:58.364 --> 41:01.124
Hmm. Only my
anger management counselor.

41:01.201 --> 41:03.609
I mean, it's in his
best interests to say it.

41:03.687 --> 41:04.686
Hmm.

41:04.704 --> 41:06.612
I am sorry I punched the guy.

41:06.631 --> 41:11.050
I promise that I will not
go into full hero mode again.

41:12.529 --> 41:15.054
Oh. Well, that would be a shame.

41:16.716 --> 41:21.703
You know, when I saw you coming
through those doors today...

41:21.721 --> 41:25.648
I had one thought running
through my mind over and over.

41:25.725 --> 41:27.132
What's that?

41:27.210 --> 41:29.134
"Catherine Harper...

41:29.154 --> 41:31.196
"if you make it
out of this alive...

41:32.549 --> 41:35.533
you are jumping
that man's bones."

41:41.074 --> 41:43.148
Hmm.
Did anybody check him?

41:43.168 --> 41:45.076
Did they check who?

41:45.152 --> 41:46.485
The guy that I punched...

41:46.505 --> 41:48.004
that I absolutely
shouldn't have,

41:48.155 --> 41:49.506
but totally deserved it?

41:49.733 --> 41:51.323
Maybe he sent the anthrax.

41:51.417 --> 41:53.993
-Mm. Cornstarch.
-Cornstarch, right.

41:54.070 --> 41:55.737
Owen we get, like,

41:55.755 --> 41:59.924
600 pieces of hate mail a day
at the Capitol.

42:00.001 --> 42:02.852
The governor
has lots of enemies.

42:03.004 --> 42:05.263
But it was addressed to you.

42:05.381 --> 42:07.582
And as someone who advocates
for the governor,

42:07.600 --> 42:11.176
I have my fair share
of enemies, too.

42:11.196 --> 42:13.178
They're mostly kooks.

42:13.256 --> 42:14.364
Generally harmless.

42:14.515 --> 42:18.493
And we have
people looking into it.

42:22.782 --> 42:26.626
Can we just...
leave this all outside tonight?

42:30.774 --> 42:32.715
Mm. No. What's this about...

42:33.459 --> 42:35.385
jumping bones?

42:35.612 --> 42:36.594
CATHERINE: Mm-hmm.

42:40.392 --> 42:41.516
(gasps)

42:42.251 --> 42:43.801
-Oh!
-What is it?

42:43.878 --> 42:45.144
(gasps)

43:01.137 --> 43:02.161
(Catherine gasps)

43:10.571 --> 43:13.423
I guess I'm not the only one
with enemies.
