(Meredith)
SAY YOU'RE IN THE O.R...

00:08.479 --> 00:11.112
REPAIRING A VENA CAVA,

00:11.112 --> 00:15.186
WHEN SUDDENLY,
EVERYTHING GOES TO HELL...

00:15.186 --> 00:18.018
I THINK WE SHOULD PRACTICE
OUR STATEMENTS TO THE JUDGE.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.051
I THINK YOU SHOULD STOP
WORRYING ABOUT IT AND RELAX.

00:20.051 --> 00:21.492
(chuckles)
(whispers)
I COULD HELP YOU WITH THAT.

00:21.492 --> 00:24.295
DEREK, WE HAVE 36 HOURS
BEFORE WE HAVE TO

00:24.295 --> 00:26.097
CONVINCE A JUDGE
THAT WE'RE ZOLA'S PARENTS.

00:26.097 --> 00:27.698
WE ARE ZOLA'S PARENTS.

00:27.698 --> 00:29.060
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW THAT.

00:29.060 --> 00:30.731
AND FOR ALL THEY KNOW,
WE...

00:30.731 --> 00:32.233
HATE CHILDREN.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.205
WE FEED CUTE LITTLE KITTENS
TO A DOG

00:34.205 --> 00:35.636
WE KEEP IN THE BACKYARD.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.068
MEREDITH.

00:37.068 --> 00:38.709
I'M JUST SAYING,
THEY DON'T KNOW US.

00:38.709 --> 00:41.612
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS JUST STAND UP THERE

00:41.612 --> 00:44.145
AND SPEAK FROM THE HEART.

00:44.145 --> 00:47.818
THAT'S ALL
THE CONVINCING THEY'LL NEED.

00:47.818 --> 00:49.680
OKAY?

00:49.680 --> 00:51.722
OKAY.

00:51.722 --> 00:55.055
SO YOU CUT THIS,
SUTURE THAT...

00:55.055 --> 00:58.489
AND SOON THAT CRAPPY SITUATION
IS A THING OF THE PAST.

00:58.489 --> 01:00.131
HEY.

01:00.131 --> 01:02.263
I MISSED YOU THIS MORNING.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

01:02.263 --> 01:05.065
YEAH. I JUST WANTED TO GET
A RUN IN BEFORE WORK.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.267
OH.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.639
OKAY. WELL, UH,
I GOTTA GET UPSTAIRS

01:08.639 --> 01:10.541
IF I'M GONNA BEAT SHEPHERD
TO ROUNDS,

01:10.541 --> 01:12.173
SO I'LL SEE YOU LATER?

01:12.173 --> 01:14.175
TOO BAD YOU CAN'T MEET
ALL OF LIFE'S CHALLENGES

01:14.175 --> 01:15.476
WITH A SURGICAL SCALPEL.

01:15.476 --> 01:16.547

I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

01:17.708 --> 01:19.710
I MEAN, YOU COULD TRY.

01:19.710 --> 01:20.711

01:20.711 --> 01:21.712
NOPE.

01:21.712 --> 01:23.154

01:27.458 --> 01:28.519
ALL RIGHT.
GET PUMPED.

01:28.519 --> 01:30.121
GETTING PUMPED.
(ding)

01:30.121 --> 01:33.624
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT'D BE CONSIDERED ASSAULT.

01:33.624 --> 01:35.095
DR. BAILEY,

01:35.095 --> 01:37.097
I'VE BEEN GOING OVER
THIS ISLET CELL DATA.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.700
AND I THINK THAT--
DR. BAILEY?

01:39.700 --> 01:42.333
ARE WE NOT GOING TO THE MOUSE
LAB TODAY? BECAUSE I--

01:42.333 --> 01:44.305
WE'VE GOT BIGGER THINGS TO
WORRY ABOUT THAN MICE, GREY.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.736

01:45.736 --> 01:47.238
GUINEA PIGS?

01:47.238 --> 01:49.240
ARE YOUR FEET
AS QUICK AS YOUR WIT?

01:49.240 --> 01:51.442
MOVE 'EM.

01:51.442 --> 01:54.114
OOH, SORRY, KAREV. I'M GONNA
NEED YOUR ESOPHAGEAL ATRESIA.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.115
WHAT--

01:55.115 --> 01:56.447
OH, AND YOU HAVE
A PYLORIC STENOSIS.

01:56.447 --> 01:57.748
I MIGHT NEED THAT ONE, TOO.

01:57.748 --> 01:59.250
WHAT ARE YOU--WHY?

01:59.250 --> 02:00.391
WELL, 'CAUSE WE HAVE
A PROSPECTIVE PEDS FELLOW

02:00.391 --> 02:01.722
COMING IN TODAY,

02:01.722 --> 02:03.154
AND SHE'S BEING COURTED
BY ALL THE BIG GUNS--

02:03.154 --> 02:04.895
U.S.C, JOHNS HOPKINS, CHOP--

02:04.895 --> 02:07.198
AND--AND HUNT ASKED ME
TO HELP TO MAKE SURE

02:07.198 --> 02:08.499
SHE GOT THE RED-CARPET TOUR,

02:08.499 --> 02:10.501
AND THAT INCLUDES SCRUBBING IN
ON A COUPLE OF SURGERIES.

02:10.501 --> 02:11.802
WAIT. WHOA, WHOA.

02:11.802 --> 02:13.234
YOU'RE ALREADY MEETING PEOPLE
FOR THE FELLOWSHIP?

02:13.234 --> 02:14.505
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE EARLY,

02:14.505 --> 02:16.237
BUT WHEN SOMEONE WITH
POLLY PRESTON'S RESUME

02:16.237 --> 02:18.509
WANTS TO OBSERVE IN
YOUR HOSPITAL, YOU MAKE TIME.

02:22.313 --> 02:24.345
JUSTINE, THESE THREE
BUBBLE-LIKE SPOTS?

02:24.345 --> 02:27.218
THOSE ARE YOUR ANEURYSMS.

02:27.218 --> 02:30.181
J-J-JUST A SECOND.

02:31.582 --> 02:33.554
(exhales) UM, SORRY.

02:33.554 --> 02:36.227
I DIDN'T HEAR A WORD.
SAY AGAIN.

02:36.227 --> 02:38.189
AH. MY ANEURYSMS.

02:38.189 --> 02:40.431
HORRIBLE THINGS. WHAT ARE
THEY DOING NOW, GROWING?

02:40.431 --> 02:42.293
IS THAT WHY
THE GOD-AWFUL HEADACHES?

02:42.293 --> 02:43.163
ONE HAS SPRUNG A LEAK.

02:44.795 --> 02:46.467
GREAT.

02:46.467 --> 02:47.738
GO AHEAD. SAY IT.

02:47.738 --> 02:49.340
SAY I TOLD YOU SO.

02:49.340 --> 02:50.801
HE'S BEEN WARNING ME
ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS,

02:50.801 --> 02:53.304
AND I HAVE BEEN AVOIDING
THIS SURGERY.

02:53.304 --> 02:54.875
(sighs)

02:54.875 --> 02:57.208
FINE.

02:57.208 --> 02:58.579
OKAY.

02:58.579 --> 03:01.252
BUT IT'S GONNA HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL I'M DONE WITH MY BOOK.

03:01.252 --> 03:03.254
(typing)
DR. GREY, WHAT ARE
THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES

03:03.254 --> 03:05.216
OF NOT FIXING A WARNING LEAK?

03:05.216 --> 03:07.318
STROKE, HEMORRHAGE, DEATH.

03:07.318 --> 03:09.920
DR. GREY, WHAT ARE
THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES

03:09.920 --> 03:11.862
FOR A BOTCHED CLIP?

03:11.862 --> 03:13.264
STROKE,

03:13.264 --> 03:15.266
HEMORRHAGE, DEATH.

03:15.266 --> 03:17.268
SO I'M DEAD,
AND MY BOOK'S NOT FINISHED.

03:17.268 --> 03:18.899
I CAN'T DO THAT
TO MY READERS.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.402
I JUST NEED TO FIND A WAY
TO GET KATE TO THE BRIDGE

03:21.402 --> 03:23.534
WHERE SHE'S
SUPPOSED TO MEET NATHAN

03:23.534 --> 03:25.376
BEFORE SHE'S PULLED BACK
IN TIME.

03:25.376 --> 03:26.707
AFTER THAT, I'M ALL YOURS.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.938
JUSTINE--

03:27.938 --> 03:30.981
YEAH, BETWEEN YOUR VOICE
AND MY LEAKY ANEURYSM,

03:30.981 --> 03:33.914
I'M HAVING A BITCH
OF A TIME FOCUSING, SO...

03:33.914 --> 03:35.886
COULD YOU...

03:35.886 --> 03:37.748
PLEASE?

03:37.748 --> 03:41.221
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

03:41.221 --> 03:43.294
(sighs)

03:44.295 --> 03:45.826
(Miranda)
WHEN I SAY THIS IS

03:45.826 --> 03:46.997
A VERY IMPORTANT PATIENT,

03:46.997 --> 03:48.799
I MEAN, SHE IS
VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

03:48.799 --> 03:51.302
I DO NOT LIKE IT, BUT I HAVE
A VERY FULL SCHEDULE TODAY,

03:51.302 --> 03:53.304
AND YOU WILL HAVE TO BE
MY PROXY.

03:53.304 --> 03:55.406
NO ONE TOUCHES THIS PATIENT
BUT YOU.

03:55.406 --> 03:57.468
YOU WILL RUN EVERY TEST
I ASK FOR.

03:57.468 --> 04:00.371
YOU WILL REPORT EVERY RESULT
BACK TO ME PERSONALLY.

04:00.371 --> 04:03.914
THIS WOMAN HAS LOST A HUSBAND
AND A SON IN THIS HOSPITAL.

04:03.914 --> 04:05.816
I WILL NOT
HAVE ANOTHER O'MALLEY

04:05.816 --> 04:07.548
LOST UNDER THIS ROOF.

04:07.548 --> 04:11.422
O'MALLEY? GEORGE'S MOTHER
IS OUR V.I.P.?

04:11.422 --> 04:12.823
MEREDITH GREY.

04:12.823 --> 04:13.984
AS PROMISED.

04:13.984 --> 04:15.786
IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

04:15.786 --> 04:18.529
OH, YOU COME OVER HERE
AND GIVE ME A HUG.

04:23.494 --> 04:25.436
THIS IS SO FREAKING COOL.

04:25.436 --> 04:27.438
I BET IT NEVER OCCURRED
TO YOU

04:27.438 --> 04:28.939
TO PUT THIS
ON YOUR WISH LIST.

04:28.939 --> 04:31.402
HOW'S THAT COMING,
BY THE WAY?

04:31.402 --> 04:32.903
WHY? DO YOU NEED IT TODAY?

04:32.903 --> 04:35.776
BECAUSE I CAN'T--
UM, I'M NOT DONE.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.849
YOU DO GET THAT THIS IS
SUPPOSED TO BE FUN, RIGHT?

04:38.849 --> 04:41.382
RIGHT.
I NEED MORE TIME.

04:41.382 --> 04:45.386
UM, DO YOU MIND, UM,
JUST...

04:45.386 --> 04:47.958
MOVING MORE TO YOUR LEFT,
PLEASE?

04:49.560 --> 04:51.522
YOUR HUSBAND'S
IN THE GALLERY.

04:51.522 --> 04:52.693
I KNOW.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.565
HENRY'S BEEN BEGGING
FOR A RIDE-ALONG.

04:54.565 --> 04:55.966
I FIGURED, IF YOU'RE GONNA
OBSERVE A SURGERY,

04:55.966 --> 04:59.470
THISIS THE ONE
YOU WANT TO SEE.

05:00.531 --> 05:02.603
HOW ARE WE DOING,
DR. PARK?

05:02.603 --> 05:05.606
JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES,
AND MY GUY DOWN AT U.C.L.A.

05:05.606 --> 05:09.640
WILL HAVE THE HEART HE'S BEEN
WAITING ON FOR OVER A YEAR.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.981
OKAY.

05:10.981 --> 05:12.082
LET'S ROLL.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.447
GOT IT.

05:20.791 --> 05:23.494
MAKE SURE THAT CONNECTION
IS SECURE.

05:23.494 --> 05:25.796
THIS TUBE CONNECTS
DIRECTLY TO THE AORTA.

05:25.796 --> 05:28.929
(cell phone rings)
THAT'S RIGHT, AND THIS TUBE
REMOVES WASTE.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.030
GOT IT.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.402
DR. PARK,
YOUR HOSPITAL'S ON THE LINE.

05:31.402 --> 05:32.733
LOOK AT THAT.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.435
SHE'S ABOUT TO CATCH
A FLIGHT TO L.A.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.837
AND NOT EVEN KNOW
SHE LEFT THE BODY.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.469
(clunking rhythmically)

05:38.469 --> 05:39.440
DAMN IT.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.511
(cell phone beeps)
WHAT IS IT?

05:40.511 --> 05:41.712
MY GUY ARRESTED.

05:41.712 --> 05:43.343
THEY WEREN'T ABLE
TO RESUSCITATE.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.344
HE'S DEAD?

05:44.344 --> 05:46.016
DAMN IT.

05:46.016 --> 05:47.878
(door opens)

05:47.878 --> 05:50.350
IT'S ALL DRESSED UP,
AND NO PLACE TO GO.

05:50.350 --> 05:54.024
(clunking continues)

06:11.402 --> 06:12.603
HERE. LET ME GET IT.

06:12.603 --> 06:15.476
IT SAYS HERE YOU'VE HAD SURGERY
THREE WEEKS AGO

06:15.476 --> 06:16.607
AT SEATTLE PRES
FOR A GALLBLADDER REMOVAL?

06:16.607 --> 06:18.409
I'VE GONE BACK THERE
A COUPLE OF TIMES,

06:18.409 --> 06:20.511
AND THEY ALWAYS TELL ME I'M FINE
AND SEND ME BACK HOME.

06:20.511 --> 06:22.953
UH, BRING ME A 20-GAUGE
JUST IN CASE, AND BENZOIN.

06:22.953 --> 06:24.555
AND, YOU KNOW,
IT'S FREEZING IN HERE.

06:24.555 --> 06:26.487
HAVE SOMEONE TAKE A LOOK
AT THAT THERMOSTAT.
(woman) YES, DOCTOR.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.858
I'M GOING TO PALPATE
YOUR ABDOMEN,

06:27.858 --> 06:30.120
AND YOU LET ME KNOW IF YOU FEEL
ANY DISCOMFORT, OKAY?

06:30.120 --> 06:32.763
THE BOYS INSISTED I DO
MY SURGERY SOMEWHERE ELSE,

06:32.763 --> 06:35.626
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED HERE
WITH HAROLD AND...

06:35.626 --> 06:37.928
(inhales sharply)
AND GEORGIE.

06:37.928 --> 06:39.530
SHE'S GOT SOME
MIDEPIGASTRIC TENDERNESS.

06:39.530 --> 06:40.871
WE SHOULD CHECK
THAT GALLBLADDER.

06:40.871 --> 06:42.773
UH, HAVE YOU BEEN
EXPERIENCING ANY FEVERS

06:42.773 --> 06:43.774
AT ALL, LOUISE?

06:43.774 --> 06:44.935
ANY PAIN, UH, VOMITING?

06:44.935 --> 06:46.877
YES, ACTUALLY, I HAVE.

06:46.877 --> 06:48.639
MRS. O'MALLEY,
THOSE AREN'T GOOD THINGS.

06:48.639 --> 06:50.140
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

06:50.140 --> 06:52.142
IT'S JUST THAT...
LOOK AT YOU.

06:52.142 --> 06:55.446
YOU KNOW HOW PROUD IT MAKES ME
TO HAVE YOU AS MY DOCTOR?

06:55.446 --> 06:57.047
THANK YOU.

06:57.047 --> 07:01.151
GREY, LET'S GET A C.T.,
C.B.C., LYTES,

07:01.151 --> 07:02.593
AND A LIVER PANEL,

07:02.593 --> 07:04.555
AND LET'S GET
ANOTHER COUPLE OF BLANKETS.

07:04.555 --> 07:06.026
I KEPT HEARING GEORGIE'S VOICE
SAYING, "MOM,

07:06.026 --> 07:07.598
"GET A SECOND OPINION.

07:07.598 --> 07:09.500
GO TO SEATTLE GRACE.
THEY'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU."

07:09.500 --> 07:11.001
WE WILL, LOUISE.

07:11.001 --> 07:12.763
WE'RE GONNA TAKE
VERY GOOD CARE OF YOU.

07:12.763 --> 07:14.204
A DOCTOR.

07:14.204 --> 07:16.006
YOU'RE ALL GROWN UP.

07:16.006 --> 07:17.708
(laughs)

07:17.708 --> 07:19.209
(door opens)

07:19.209 --> 07:21.141
(Teddy) LOOKS LIKE COLUMBIA'S
GOT A GOOD MATCH

07:21.141 --> 07:22.673
WHO'S ALREADY CONSENTED.

07:22.673 --> 07:25.045
WE'RE CONTACTING THEM NOW
TO ARRANGE PICK-UP,

07:25.045 --> 07:26.717
BUT IT WILL BE HOURS
BEFORE THEY ARRIVE.

07:26.717 --> 07:28.679
IN THE MEANTIME, HER VITALS
NEED TO BE MONITORED

07:28.679 --> 07:30.551
AND LACTATE LEVELS
CHECKED HOURLY.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.553
OKAY, SO I'LL FIND
AN INTERN TO BABYSIT.

07:32.553 --> 07:35.826
OH, I, UH, I'M NOT
LEAVING HER WITH AN INTERN.

07:35.826 --> 07:37.928
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

07:37.928 --> 07:39.760
DR. YANG, THIS IS
A BEATING HEART

07:39.760 --> 07:40.991
IN A BOX.

07:40.991 --> 07:42.462
I'M VERY SERIOUS.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.764
AND YOU NEED MORE TIME

07:43.764 --> 07:45.566
TO FINISH YOUR WISH LIST
ANYWAY.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.537
RIGHT?

07:46.537 --> 07:48.669
PAGE IF YOU NEED ME.

07:48.669 --> 07:51.572
(clunking rhythmically)

07:51.572 --> 07:52.773
(elevator bell dings)

07:52.773 --> 07:54.575
(sighs)
(Owen) SHEPHERD,
I CAN'T APPROVE THIS.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.906
I'M NOT ASKING
YOUR APPROVAL.

07:55.906 --> 07:58.779
I'M GIVING YOU A HEADS-UP,
AS A COURTESY.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.250
AH, I HAVE TO BE
AT A BOARD MEETING.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.682
WELL, DON'T LET ME
HOLD YOU UP.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.784
(sighs)

08:05.115 --> 08:06.657
MM-HMM.

08:06.657 --> 08:08.018
YIKES.
THESE ARE INTENSE.

08:08.018 --> 08:09.520
ARE THESE PATIENTS
OF YOURS?

08:09.520 --> 08:10.621
THEY WILL BE.

08:10.621 --> 08:11.862
I WENT LOOKING FOR PATIENTS

08:11.862 --> 08:13.994
WHO WERE TOLD NO BY
EVERY DOCTOR THEY'VE SEEN.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.195
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

08:15.195 --> 08:16.627
TELL THEM YES.

08:16.627 --> 08:17.828
TELL THEM I WILL DO MY BEST.

08:17.828 --> 08:19.499
IT'S NOT JUST ME.
IT'S YOU, TOO.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.601
YOU READY?

08:20.601 --> 08:21.672

08:21.672 --> 08:22.803
MM-HMM.

08:25.035 --> 08:26.537
WHAT'S THIS?

08:26.537 --> 08:29.039
UH, JUSTINE CAMPBELL'S,
UH, A.M.A. FORMS.

08:29.039 --> 08:31.011
SHE'S LEAVING
AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE SO--

08:31.011 --> 08:32.182
OH, SO YOU'RE NOT READY.

08:32.182 --> 08:33.544
WHAT? WHY?

08:33.544 --> 08:34.685
YES. WE'RE SAYING YES.

08:34.685 --> 08:36.186
IF YOU CAN'T GET HER
TO SAY YES

08:36.186 --> 08:38.188
TO A SIMPLE SURGERY
THAT WILL SAVE HER LIFE,

08:38.188 --> 08:40.190
HOW DO YOU EXPECT

08:40.190 --> 08:41.952
TO TACKLE THAT?

08:41.952 --> 08:43.554
(sighs)

08:43.554 --> 08:45.055
TEAR THOSE UP.

08:45.055 --> 08:46.727
GET HER TO SAY YES, AND I'LL
LET YOU JUMP ON ONE OF THESE.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.960
OKAY? WHAT DO YOU SAY?

08:49.960 --> 08:51.131
YES.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.663
DAMN RIGHT.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.205
(door opens)

08:55.205 --> 08:56.837
COME ON.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.809
TELL ME I'M PARANOID
OR SOMETHING.

08:58.809 --> 09:00.811
YOU'RE PARANOID.
THANK YOU.

09:00.811 --> 09:02.542
ALTHOUGH, SHE DID THROW
A SOFTBALL AT HIS GIRLFRIEND.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.774
IKNOW.SCREW THIS.

09:03.774 --> 09:06.577
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BE
AROUND SLOAN TODAY. I...

09:06.577 --> 09:08.649
JUST TAKE ME OFF PLASTICS,
JUST FOR THE DAY.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.020
I GOTTA CLEAR MY HEAD.

09:10.020 --> 09:11.622
I AM NOT GONNA REARRANGE
THE WHOLE SURGICAL SCHEDULE

09:11.622 --> 09:12.753
JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE HAVING
GIRL PROBLEMS.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.124
JUST SUCK IT UP.

09:14.124 --> 09:15.726
(exhales deeply)

09:15.726 --> 09:17.828
YOU GUYS EVER HEAR
OF A POLLY PRESTON?

09:17.828 --> 09:19.690
UH, CHIEF RESIDENT
AT THE BRIGHAM?

09:19.690 --> 09:21.892
SHE'S ONLY MY NUMBER ONE
PEER ROLE MODEL.

09:21.892 --> 09:23.133
YOU'RE A FREAK,
AND I HATE YOU.

09:23.133 --> 09:25.295
WHAT ARE YOU
WORKING ON TODAY, KAREV?

09:25.295 --> 09:27.668
A FAT LOT OF NOTHING NOW.
WHY?

09:27.668 --> 09:29.239
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
ABOUT A NERVE GRAFT?

09:29.239 --> 09:33.143
I WOULD FEEL GREAT
ABOUT A NERVE GRAFT.

09:33.143 --> 09:35.776
FINE.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.709
(Jackson) THANK YOU.

09:38.709 --> 09:39.950

09:39.950 --> 09:41.581
(inhales sharply)

09:41.581 --> 09:42.813
OOH.

09:42.813 --> 09:44.715
THE PAIN'S GETTING WORSE?

09:44.715 --> 09:46.717
DOES IT LOOK LIKE
IT'S GETTING BETTER?

09:46.717 --> 09:48.588
I KNOW WHAT CAN REALLY HELP.
WHAT?

09:48.588 --> 09:49.890
CLIPPING YOUR ANEURYSM.
CUTE.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.662
LOOK, I'M SURE IF YOU CALL
YOUR PUBLISHERS

09:51.662 --> 09:53.964
AND YOU TELL THEM,
THEY'LL EXTEND THE DEADLINE.

09:53.964 --> 09:55.666
IT IS NOT ABOUT A DEADLINE.

09:55.666 --> 09:57.998
IT'S ABOUT
MY READERS OUT THERE,

09:57.998 --> 10:00.671
WHO ARE WAITING FOR ME
TO FINISH A SERIES

10:00.671 --> 10:02.903
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING
FOR TEN YEARS.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.375
YOU'RE REALLY THAT POPULAR?

10:05.375 --> 10:06.907
WOW. YOU REALLY KNOW

10:06.907 --> 10:08.909
HOW TO KICK A GIRL
IN THE EGO, DON'T YOU?

10:08.909 --> 10:10.240
I'M--I'M SORRY.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.882
WE DON'T GET A LOT OF TIME
TO READ AROUND HERE.

10:11.882 --> 10:14.044
UH, WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?

10:14.044 --> 10:15.746
I-I MEAN, I'M--I'M SURE
THAT THEY WOULDN'T WANT--

10:15.746 --> 10:18.188
DO YOU SEE ANY FAMILY
SITTING WITH ME, DR. GREY?

10:18.188 --> 10:19.720
I'M A WRITER.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.251
MY CHARACTERS ARE MY FAMILY,

10:21.251 --> 10:23.694
AND I CARE ABOUT THEM.

10:23.694 --> 10:25.195
AND I'VE MANAGED TO MAKE
A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE

10:25.195 --> 10:27.027
CARE ABOUT THEM AS WELL.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.800
YES, I WANT TO GIVE
MY READERS CLOSURE.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.733
BUT KATE AND NATHAN
AND ALEXANDER,

10:32.733 --> 10:35.836
I OWE THEM CLOSURE.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.008

WHO CAN GIVE IT TO 'EM.

10:38.008 --> 10:40.170
I'M JUST TRYING

10:40.170 --> 10:41.842
YOU WANT TO HELP ME?

10:41.842 --> 10:42.843

10:49.019 --> 10:51.722

10:51.722 --> 10:53.754

10:55.756 --> 10:57.728

I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

10:57.728 --> 10:59.860
IT'S ASTOUNDING.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.863
UH, WHAT ARE YOU, UH,

11:18.849 --> 11:19.980

11:22.713 --> 11:24.354
YANG,

11:24.354 --> 11:26.286
YOU'RE WASTING AN OPPORTUNITY

11:26.286 --> 11:28.688
ON 300 PAGES
OF COMMON PROCEDURE.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.391
SHE LET A STARVING PERSON
LOOSE IN A GROCERY STORE.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.764
SHE ASKED WHAT I WANT.
I WANT EVERYTHING.

11:33.764 --> 11:35.065
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

11:35.065 --> 11:36.066
GET CREATIVE.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.711
UNLOCK YOUR MIND.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:54.714 --> 11:57.387
I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT

11:57.387 --> 12:01.852

23:45.094 --> 23:46.556
SEE, THAT'S THE WORST PART
ABOUT BEING CHIEF.

23:46.556 --> 23:48.598
YOU HAVE TO SAY NO TO EVERYBODY,
AND THEY HATE YOU FOR IT.

23:48.598 --> 23:50.500
AND YOU SAY NO ENOUGH,
YOU'RE GONNA HATE YOURSELF,

23:50.500 --> 23:53.503
WHICH IS WHY I'M NOT GONNA
WATCH YOU GO THROUGH THIS.

23:53.503 --> 23:54.564
I HAVE A CONSULT.

23:54.564 --> 23:56.065
IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE,
SET THEM FREE.

23:56.065 --> 23:57.707
IF THEY COME BACK...

23:57.707 --> 23:59.539
I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.970
(slaps back)

24:00.970 --> 24:02.512
HEY,
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

24:02.512 --> 24:03.643
NO.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.444
(door opens)

24:06.876 --> 24:09.048
I GOTTA SAY, I'M A BIG FAN
OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS ROOM.

24:09.048 --> 24:10.580
MM. EVERY DAY SHOULD BE...
(laughs)

24:10.580 --> 24:13.523
BRING YOUR HUSBAND
TO WORK DAY.

24:13.523 --> 24:15.054
LISTEN, I'VE HAD THIS IDEA.

24:15.054 --> 24:18.087
I FELT SILLY
EVEN CONSIDERING IT.

24:18.087 --> 24:19.589
LIKE, "REALLY?

24:19.589 --> 24:21.591
Y-YOU THINK THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU'RE GONNA DO?"

24:21.591 --> 24:24.894
BUT NOW, THOUGH, I'M THINKING
I REALLY WANT TO DO IT.

24:24.894 --> 24:26.996
I WANT TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

24:28.538 --> 24:30.469
OH, OKAY. I MEAN...

24:30.469 --> 24:31.771
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT SILLY.

24:31.771 --> 24:34.243
ADULTS GO BACK TO SCHOOL
ALL THE TIME.

24:34.243 --> 24:36.105
MEDICAL SCHOOL.

24:36.105 --> 24:37.877
WOW. (chuckles)

24:37.877 --> 24:40.610
I MEAN...

24:40.610 --> 24:41.851
WOW.

24:41.851 --> 24:43.553
YEAH.

24:43.553 --> 24:45.154
HEY, WHAT TIME IS IT?

24:45.154 --> 24:46.716
OH.
(cell phone beeps)

24:46.716 --> 24:48.257
WE GOT ANOTHER SURGERY
TO GET TO.

24:48.257 --> 24:49.759
COME ON. UP AND AT 'EM.

24:49.759 --> 24:52.491
(Justine) KATE COULDN'T KEEP IT
TO HERSELF ANY LONGER.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.163
(typing)
SHE TOOK HIM BY THE HAND

24:54.163 --> 24:56.495
AND LOOKED DEEP INTO
THOSE OCEAN BLUE EYES.

24:56.495 --> 25:00.870
"I HAVE FIGURED OUT WHY I TRAVEL
THROUGH TIME, NATHAN.

25:00.870 --> 25:03.933
I HAVE FIGURED IT OUT, AND NOW
I KNOW HOW I CAN STOP IT."

25:03.933 --> 25:05.535
OH, MY GOD.

25:05.535 --> 25:07.877
"I CAN CHOOSE WHERE TO BE,
WHEN TO BE.

25:07.877 --> 25:10.710
AND I HAVE. I HAVE CHOSEN."

25:10.710 --> 25:12.281
OH, MY GOD. YES.

25:12.281 --> 25:14.884
NATHAN PULLED HER INTO HIS ARMS
AND HELD ON TIGHTLY.

25:14.884 --> 25:17.547
KATE WHISPERED
AGAINST HIS CHEST,

25:17.547 --> 25:20.519
"I'M SORRY.
I AM SO, SO SORRY."

25:20.519 --> 25:21.721
WAIT. WHAT?

25:21.721 --> 25:23.192
SHE'D NEVER KNOW
IF HE HEARD HER.

25:23.192 --> 25:24.994
WHEN SHE OPENED HER EYES,

25:24.994 --> 25:26.656
NATHAN WAS GONE.

25:26.656 --> 25:28.527
SHE WAS IN PARIS.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.730
IT WAS TIME TO LOOK
FOR ALEXANDER.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.001
WHAT?

25:32.001 --> 25:33.633
SHE CHOOSES ALEXANDER?

25:33.633 --> 25:34.734
NO!

25:34.734 --> 25:36.666
NO WAY. IT HA--
IT HAS TO BE NATHAN.

25:36.666 --> 25:38.237
IT'S NOT NATHAN.

25:38.237 --> 25:41.140
BUT HE'S--HE'S SO HANDSOME
AND GOOD.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.642
AND--AND ALEXANDER--

25:42.642 --> 25:43.973
IS HER SOUL MATE.

25:43.973 --> 25:45.314
HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A SOUL.

25:45.314 --> 25:46.846
I MEAN, HE'S A CRIMINAL.

25:46.846 --> 25:49.148
THEY--THEY--THEY DON'T EVEN
WANT THE SAME THINGS.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.680
THEY MAKE EACH OTHER
MISERABLE.

25:50.680 --> 25:53.052
DR. GREY, I CANNOT BETRAY
MY CHARACTERS--

25:53.052 --> 25:54.223
YOU'RE THE WRITER.

25:54.223 --> 25:56.255
YOU CAN MAKE THEM DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

25:56.255 --> 25:57.657
AND--AND PICKING NATHAN,

25:57.657 --> 26:00.129
THAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
OHH.

26:00.129 --> 26:01.591
YOU HATE IT. NO, I-I KNOW.

26:01.591 --> 26:03.092
NO, NO.
YOU HATE IT.

26:03.092 --> 26:04.333
OH, GOD.
(monitor beeping rapidly)

26:04.333 --> 26:05.995
OKAY, PAGE SHEPHERD. NOW.

26:05.995 --> 26:07.236
I THINK HER ANEURYSM BLEW.
(groans)

26:12.972 --> 26:14.844
SUCTION.
(suction gurgling)

26:14.844 --> 26:16.706
OH, DAMN.
IT'S A BIG BLEED.

26:16.706 --> 26:18.347
IF YOU HAD SPENT LESS TIME
TAKING DICTATION,

26:18.347 --> 26:19.849
WE COULD'VE AVOIDED THIS.

26:19.849 --> 26:21.911
DID SHE AT LEAST FINISH
THE BOOK?

26:21.911 --> 26:23.653
NO, BUT SHE DID TELL ME
HOW IT'S GONNA END.

26:23.653 --> 26:25.014
IT'S SO STUPID.

26:25.014 --> 26:26.916
SHE--SHE'S WRITTEN
THIS INCREDIBLE STORY

26:26.916 --> 26:28.758
WITH THESE AMAZING CHARACTERS,

26:28.758 --> 26:30.820
AND THEN SHE JUST BLOWS IT.

26:30.820 --> 26:32.361
WOW. YOU'RE 15 RIGHT NOW.

26:32.361 --> 26:33.793
IT'S CRIMINAL,
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.725
AND--AND WHEN SHE WAKES UP,
I'M GONNA TELL HER THAT.

26:35.725 --> 26:36.966
OR MAYBE IT'S NONE OF
YOUR BUSINESS.

26:36.966 --> 26:38.327
IT'S THE SAME THING
THAT YOU ARE DOING

26:38.327 --> 26:39.799
WITH THESE HOPELESS CASES.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.200
YOU KNOW,
YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN CHANGE

26:41.200 --> 26:42.872
THE WAY THE PATIENT'S STORY
IS GONNA END.

26:42.872 --> 26:44.103
AND IF YOU THINK THAT,

26:44.103 --> 26:45.905
THEN YOU'RE AT LEAST
OBLIGATED TO TRY.

26:45.905 --> 26:48.377
SO I GOTTA TRY,
RIGHT?

26:48.377 --> 26:50.279
YES.

26:50.279 --> 26:52.011
(sighs)

26:59.288 --> 27:01.821
YOU DOUBLE-CHECKED
HER LABS AND SCANS?

27:01.821 --> 27:03.052
YES, OF COURSE.

27:03.052 --> 27:05.224
I JUST DON'T WANT ANY SURPRISES
ONCE I'M IN THERE.

27:05.224 --> 27:09.699
ACTUALLY, SHE THOUGHT I'D BE
PERFORMING HER SURGERY.

27:09.699 --> 27:11.701
OH, I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH THAT.

27:11.701 --> 27:13.763
I CAN DO A SEPTOPLASTY.
YOU TAUGHT ME A SEPTOPLASTY.

27:13.763 --> 27:15.705
I THOUGHT I TAUGHT YOU
A LOT OF THINGS.

27:15.705 --> 27:16.866
NOW I'M THINKING,

27:16.866 --> 27:19.809
I MUST NOT BE
MUCH OF A TEACHER AT ALL.

27:22.171 --> 27:24.844
I'M GOING TO COURT TOMORROW...

27:24.844 --> 27:26.676
TO PROVE TO A JUDGE
THAT'S NEVER MET ME

27:26.676 --> 27:27.777
THAT I'M A GOOD PERSON,

27:27.777 --> 27:29.148
A FIT MOTHER.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.150
I WANT MY KID BACK
SO BADLY,

27:31.150 --> 27:32.822
I'M RACKING MY BRAIN
FOR ANYTHING

27:32.822 --> 27:34.383
THAT'LL MAKE HIM
SEE ME THAT WAY.

27:34.383 --> 27:37.857
I WANT TO DRESS THE PART,
SO I'M THINKING MY NAVY DRESS.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.859
BUT THERE'S A BUTTON MISSING,
AND IT SHOWS TOO MUCH CLEAVAGE.

27:39.859 --> 27:42.231
MY CHARCOAL PANTS
HAVE A HOLE IN THE ASS.

27:42.231 --> 27:44.163
I'VE GOT ONE SHOT AT THIS.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.796
I'M USELESS...

27:46.796 --> 27:48.367
AND FRUSTRATED.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.840
BUT I KNOW HOW TO DO
AN E.R.C.P.

27:50.840 --> 27:52.301
AND I KNOW WHEN TO
DOUBLE-CHECK LABS.

27:52.301 --> 27:54.273
AND I KNOW HOW TO DO
A SEPTOPLASTY.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.706
I'M NOT USELESS HERE.

27:56.706 --> 27:59.849
(water running)

28:03.412 --> 28:06.455
FINE. DO THE SURGERY.

28:08.918 --> 28:12.922
(clunking rhythmically)

28:12.922 --> 28:15.795
OFF-PUMP CORONARY BYPASS.

28:15.795 --> 28:18.768
(clunking continues)

28:18.768 --> 28:20.329
NO.

28:20.329 --> 28:22.231
(clunking continues)

28:22.231 --> 28:24.233
EN BLOC TRANSPLANT,

28:24.233 --> 28:26.906
HEART AND BOTH LUNGS.

28:26.906 --> 28:30.179
(clunking continues)

28:30.179 --> 28:31.781
YES.

28:31.781 --> 28:33.082
I DON'T GET IT.

28:33.082 --> 28:34.844
I MEAN, WEBBER TALKS ABOUT
THIS THING

28:34.844 --> 28:36.285
LIKE IT'S A MAGIC 8 BALL.

28:36.285 --> 28:37.887
IT'S A HEART...

28:37.887 --> 28:40.349
IN A BOX.

28:40.349 --> 28:41.951
OKAY, WHEN YOU TAKE AN ORGAN
OUT FOR TRANSPLANT,

28:41.951 --> 28:43.122
WHAT DO YOU DO?

28:43.122 --> 28:44.123
PUT IT ON ICE.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.354
YEAH, YOU PUT IT ON ICE

28:45.354 --> 28:46.796
AND RUN TO PLACE IT
IN THE RECIPIENT'S BODY,

28:46.796 --> 28:48.027
AND THEN YOU WAIT AND HOPE

28:48.027 --> 28:50.459
FOR THIS COLD, DEAD HEART

28:50.459 --> 28:52.131
TO WARM UP AND COME BACK
TO LIFE, RIGHT?

28:52.131 --> 28:53.332
MM-HMM.
BUT SHE--

28:53.332 --> 28:54.333
SHE?

28:54.333 --> 28:55.935
SHE HAS NEVER STOPPED BEATING.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.266
SHE'S NEVER
STOPPED BEING WARM,

28:57.266 --> 28:58.868
NEVER STOPPED LIVING.

28:58.868 --> 29:00.039
SURE, IT'S PRETTY--
IT'S A FRIGGIN' MIRACLE.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.210
OKAY?

29:01.210 --> 29:03.142
YOU'RE STANDING BEFORE
A MIRACLE.

29:03.142 --> 29:05.114
AND ONCE YOU REALIZE THAT,

29:05.114 --> 29:08.377
SHE'LL CHANGE
YOUR PERSPECTIVE.

29:08.377 --> 29:10.349
OKAY, HERE'S WHAT I DO.

29:10.349 --> 29:12.381
I LOOK AT AN ITEM
ON MY LIST,

29:12.381 --> 29:14.353
I LOOK AT HEART-IN-A-BOX.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.355
AND IF THAT SURGERY
ON MY LIST

29:16.355 --> 29:19.028
ISN'T HALF AS COOL
AS HEART-IN-A-BOX,

29:19.028 --> 29:21.831
THEN IT IS NOT WORTH MY TIME.

29:21.831 --> 29:25.434
SHE LETS YOU KNOW
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO YOU.

29:25.434 --> 29:26.966
THAT'S WHAT
HEART-IN-A-BOX DOES.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.969
(clunking continues)

29:29.969 --> 29:31.040
AND SHE'S NICE TO TALK TO.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.371
(whispers)
SHH. SHUT UP. SHUT UP.

29:32.371 --> 29:35.204
(clunking continues)

29:35.204 --> 29:36.846
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON?

29:36.846 --> 29:39.078
UM, I'M NOT SURE.

29:39.078 --> 29:42.151
IT'S NOT LIKE HARVARD
OR STANFORD. IT FEELS--

29:42.151 --> 29:44.153
I DON'T KNOW.
IT FEELS DOABLE.

29:44.153 --> 29:46.355
DOABLE?

29:46.355 --> 29:48.557
OKAY, I-I--I'M SORRY,
BUT... (sighs)

29:48.557 --> 29:51.290
MEDICAL SCHOOL ISN'T SOMETHING
THAT YOU--YOU--YOU--

29:51.290 --> 29:52.892
YOU JUST DECIDE TO DO.

29:52.892 --> 29:55.124
REALLY?
HOW DID IT HAPPEN FOR YOU?

29:55.124 --> 29:56.996
THE LADY OF THE LAKE APPEARED

29:56.996 --> 29:58.828
WITH A GILDED SCALPEL
AND ANOINTED YOU A MED STUDENT?

29:58.828 --> 29:59.829
HA HA.

29:59.829 --> 30:01.030
I'M ACTUALLY BEING SERIOUS
RIGHT NOW.

30:01.030 --> 30:02.571
I MEAN, HOW IS MY DECISION
TO GO TO MED SCHOOL

30:02.571 --> 30:03.933
ANY DIFFERENT THAN YOURS?

30:03.933 --> 30:06.075
FIRST OF ALL, I WAS 19.

30:06.075 --> 30:08.077
ALL RIGHT, GREAT.
SO I'M OLD. WHAT ELSE?

30:08.077 --> 30:09.578
UH, I DON'T KNOW.

30:09.578 --> 30:12.081
UM, HAVE YOU TAKEN YOUR
THREE YEARS OF PREREQUISITES?

30:12.081 --> 30:13.512
UH, HOW ABOUT THE M-CAT?

30:13.512 --> 30:15.344
NO, I HAVE NOT, BUT I DO
HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE.

30:15.344 --> 30:16.986
I MAY HAVE BEEN
A BASEBALL PLAYER,

30:16.986 --> 30:18.087
BUT I THINK I REMEMBER
HOW TO STUDY.

30:18.087 --> 30:19.318
OKAY,
THAT STILL DOESN'T ACCOUNT

30:19.318 --> 30:21.320
FOR THE FOUR YEARS
OF ACTUAL MED SCHOOL.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.252
AND--AND IF YOU DECIDE TO GO
COMPLETELY CRAZY

30:23.252 --> 30:25.254
AND YOU WANT TO TRY
TO BECOME A SURGEON,

30:25.254 --> 30:28.827
THAT'S FIVE YEARS
OF RESIDENCY, A FELLOWSHIP--

30:28.827 --> 30:30.329
NO, I NEVER S--I NEVER SAID
I WANTED TO BE A SURGEON.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.331
THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER WAYS
TO USE A MEDICAL EDUCATION.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.003
OKAY, FINE.

30:34.003 --> 30:35.504
FINE.

30:36.966 --> 30:38.938
I LOVE THE WAY
THINGS ARE RIGHT NOW.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.309
I REALLY DO.

30:40.309 --> 30:42.041
AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEND
TEN YEARS

30:42.041 --> 30:44.143
MARRIED TO A MED STUDENT.

30:44.143 --> 30:46.145
NO. YOU'D JUST RATHER
I FOLLOWED YOU AROUND,

30:46.145 --> 30:47.276
LOOKING CUTE.

30:47.276 --> 30:48.878
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:48.878 --> 30:50.049
YOU--YOU KNOW THAT
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.150
I WAS GONNA DIE.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.252
MY DISEASE
WAS GOING TO KILL ME.

30:53.252 --> 30:55.154
AND THEN I MET YOU.

30:55.154 --> 30:56.855
YOU CAME INTO MY LIFE,

30:56.855 --> 30:58.387
AND SUDDENLY
I HAVE INSURANCE,

30:58.387 --> 31:00.389
I HAVE A WIFE,
I HAVE A LIFE EXPECTANCY

31:00.389 --> 31:01.931
BEYOND THE NEXT THREE MONTHS.

31:01.931 --> 31:03.562
SUE ME IF I DON'T WANT
TO WASTE ANY OF IT.

31:03.562 --> 31:04.894
HENRY, I--
JUST--

31:04.894 --> 31:06.065
I'M...

31:06.065 --> 31:07.897
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME.

41:13.001 --> 41:15.544
ALL RIGHT.

41:15.544 --> 41:17.145
DRIVE SAFE.

41:17.145 --> 41:19.107
IT'S A LITTLE BIT HORRIFYING

41:19.107 --> 41:21.610
JUST HOW QUICKLY
EVERYTHING CAN FALL TO CRAP.

41:21.610 --> 41:23.752
O'MALLEY WASN'T A CREEP,
OKAY?

41:23.752 --> 41:26.685
IF HE WERE HERE NOW, HE'D BE
KICKING ALL OF OUR ASSES.

41:26.685 --> 41:27.956
HE WOULD'VE SLAPPED
CHIEF RESIDENT

41:27.956 --> 41:28.987
RIGHT OUT OF KEPNER'S HAND.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.119
I JUST DON'T LIKE
THINKING ABOUT HIM

41:31.119 --> 41:32.661
BECAUSE THEN I HAVE TO
THINK ABOUT IZZIE,

41:32.661 --> 41:35.493
AND THEN I GET ALL SAD
AND SAPPY AND...

41:35.493 --> 41:37.766
I TOTALLY MISS THE CHANCE
TO NAIL HOT, DRUNK CHICKS

41:37.766 --> 41:40.168
WHO SPENT THE DAY THINKING
ABOUT HOW I'M AWESOME,

41:40.168 --> 41:43.031
WHICH I SHOULD BE ALL ABOUT.

41:43.031 --> 41:45.033
GEORGE IS DEAD,
AND IZZIE IS GONE,

41:45.033 --> 41:48.677
AND WE'RE ALL DIFFERENT.

41:48.677 --> 41:50.078
WE'RE DIFFERENT.

41:50.078 --> 41:52.541
SOMETIMES IT TAKES A HUGE LOSS

41:52.541 --> 41:55.043
TO REMIND YOU OF WHAT
YOU CARE ABOUT THE MOST.

41:55.043 --> 41:58.647
SOMETIMES YOU FIND YOURSELF
BECOMING STRONGER AS A RESULT,

41:58.647 --> 42:00.619
WISER, BETTER EQUIPPED

42:00.619 --> 42:03.091
TO DEAL WITH THE NEXT
BIG DISASTER THAT COMES ALONG.

42:03.091 --> 42:04.853
HEY.

42:04.853 --> 42:07.055
THAT WAS OUR FIRST
REAL FIGHT.

42:07.055 --> 42:09.027
(coughs)

42:09.027 --> 42:10.859
YOU OKAY?

42:10.859 --> 42:14.032
♪♪♪

42:14.032 --> 42:15.203
(coughs)

42:15.203 --> 42:16.805
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

42:16.805 --> 42:18.136
OKAY. YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

42:18.136 --> 42:19.167
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

42:19.167 --> 42:21.069
SOMETIMES...
LOOK AT ME.

42:21.069 --> 42:22.210
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

42:22.210 --> 42:24.613
BUT NOT ALWAYS.

42:24.613 --> 42:29.177
(siren wailing)
