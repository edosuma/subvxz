-Sir Isa-who?
-Oh, very well.

12:02.179 --> 12:03.723
(gasps)

12:03.806 --> 12:06.642
Colonel Klink!
Did you ever get my letters?

12:06.726 --> 12:08.477
I'm not actually Colonel Klink.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.480
-I'm just assuming his form.
-(chuckles)

12:11.564 --> 12:14.442
Did you know Hogan had tunnels
all over your camp?

12:14.525 --> 12:17.361
Homer! That's not
why I'm here.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.530
My job is to show you
how miserable life would be

12:20.406 --> 12:23.075
if you married Mindy
instead of Marge.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.746
Ooh, I would live
in a big mansion?

12:28.247 --> 12:30.374
(both grunting)

12:30.458 --> 12:33.753
-I'm so happy, darling.
-I as well.

12:33.836 --> 12:37.381
-Are you happy, Jeeves?
-Yes, sir. Quite.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.718
-Then we're all happy.
-Let's get out of here.

12:40.801 --> 12:44.263
Sure, life is good for you,
but what about Marge?

12:45.848 --> 12:48.434
(gasps)
Marge lives here?

12:48.517 --> 12:50.102
MAN: Madam President,
your approval rating is soaring.

12:50.853 --> 12:51.812
MARGE: Mmm.

12:51.896 --> 12:54.398
This dream is over.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.692
(screaming)

12:56.776 --> 12:58.819
(grunting)

12:58.903 --> 13:00.946
Hey, you,
get out of my office!

13:01.030 --> 13:03.073
-Nerd!
-(kids taunting)

13:06.535 --> 13:08.454
You're goofy-looking.
(laughing)

13:08.537 --> 13:10.831
(all grunting)

13:10.915 --> 13:15.211
(panting)
Whoa!

13:17.671 --> 13:19.381
-What the hell?
-Shh!

13:24.804 --> 13:27.973
(murmuring)

13:28.057 --> 13:31.227
-What is this place?
-The refuge of the damned.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.395
A place where we can work
on our extra-credit assignments

13:34.021 --> 13:36.315
without fear of reprisal.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.943
Come, you must be tired
from the chase.

13:39.026 --> 13:42.863
Oliver, bring our friend a hard-boiled egg
and some prune juice.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.032
Finally, Bart's one of us.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.284
(kids)

<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>Tell a lie. Tell a lie.</i>

14:05.970 --> 14:09.056
Because I have a small role
in a Broadway musical.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.058
It's not much,
but it's a start.

14:14.478 --> 14:16.981
-Are you hiding something from me?
-Like what?

14:17.064 --> 14:18.983
Judging from your song,
you're infatuated

14:19.066 --> 14:21.861
with a woman named Mindy
or a man named Andy.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.738
-Lisa, look out behind you!
-Dad, I'm not gonna fall for that.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.992
No, Lisa, I swear to you!
I'm 100% completely serious!

14:28.075 --> 14:30.619
You've gotta turn around
right now before it's too late!

14:30.703 --> 14:31.662
-Huh?
-Sucker!

14:33.789 --> 14:36.876
"Mindy, because of our
uncontrollable attraction,

14:36.959 --> 14:40.713
I think we should avoid
each other from now on."

14:40.796 --> 14:44.842
"Max, what I did,
I did because of alcohol and anger."

14:44.925 --> 14:47.636
"I'm tired of these jokes
about my giant hand.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.723
The first such incident
occurred in 1956 when"--

14:50.806 --> 14:53.684
-Hi, Homer.
-Mindy! Uh-- (clears throat)

14:53.767 --> 14:56.562
Oh, no, I'm sweating

14:56.645 --> 15:00.733
Mu-- Murphy, youse--
You are a elf--

15:00.816 --> 15:04.403
Uncontrollably, I think--

15:04.486 --> 15:07.489
<i>(gibberish)</i>

15:07.573 --> 15:10.284
Look at those two
inseparable chums, Smithers.

15:10.367 --> 15:13.871
That's exactly the teamwork we'd like to
showcase at this year's energy convention.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.916
-Are you sure, sir?
-Well, no one else seems to share

15:16.999 --> 15:18.751
the same spirit of camaraderie.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.544
<i>(gibberish continues)</i>

15:20.628 --> 15:23.839
<i>(screaming)</i>

15:23.923 --> 15:26.216
Simpson, Simmons,
you two have been chosen

15:26.300 --> 15:29.053
to represent us at
the National Energy Convention.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.805
Congratulations. You'll be spending two
nights together in glamorous Capital City.

15:31.889 --> 15:35.017
Wow! Capital City!

15:35.100 --> 15:36.852
The Windy Apple!

15:36.936 --> 15:38.854
Come on.
I'll get you the tickets.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.191
Oh, this is the worst crisis
my marriage has ever faced!

15:42.274 --> 15:46.362
Colonel Klink,
why have you forsaken me?

15:46.445 --> 15:49.031
-What is it? You have a question?
-(chuckling)

15:49.114 --> 15:51.784
Did you know Kinch had
a radio in the coffee pot?

15:51.867 --> 15:53.702
He did? Mmm!

15:54.912 --> 15:55.871
(groans)

16:05.422 --> 16:07.508
TV's there, bathroom's there,

16:07.591 --> 16:10.219
and there's your king-sized bed
for--

16:10.302 --> 16:12.096
(wolf whistle, meowing)

16:12.179 --> 16:15.265
(imitates bed squeaking,
growls, pants)

16:15.349 --> 16:16.684

16:16.767 --> 16:18.185
(gibberish)
Hubba-hubba.

16:18.268 --> 16:20.813
Stop that!
I love my wife and family.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.106
All I'm gonna use this bed for
is sleeping, eating,

16:22.189 --> 16:23.899
and maybe building a little fort.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.359
That's it!

16:25.442 --> 16:29.405
(gasps)
Free mouthwash! Free shampoo!

16:29.488 --> 16:33.242
-Free shower curtain!
-MINDY: Free shower curtain!

16:33.325 --> 16:36.078
-Mindy?
-Homer?

16:36.161 --> 16:40.833
Wow. If it weren't for this wall,
we'd be sleeping in the same bed.

16:40.916 --> 16:44.586
Yeah. Uh, walls are a necessity
in today's society. (chuckles)

16:44.670 --> 16:49.883
Homer, I got a really wicked idea
that could get us into a lot of trouble.

16:49.967 --> 16:53.846
Oh! Mindy, we have to fight
our temptation.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.932
No, Homer. Let's do it.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.517
Let's call room service!

16:58.600 --> 17:01.311
-Oh.
-(beeping)

17:01.395 --> 17:03.439
Someone is charging room service
to the company, sir.

17:03.522 --> 17:06.233
Well, we'll just see about that.

17:07.735 --> 17:10.696
Fly, my pretties. Fly!

17:10.779 --> 17:12.906

17:17.244 --> 17:18.996
Continue the research.

17:19.079 --> 17:22.041
-(lips smacking)
-Mmm!

17:22.124 --> 17:25.794
-I can't believe we ordered so much.
-Oh, something's missing.

17:25.878 --> 17:29.465
Ooh! One of the turkeys
fell behind the bed.

17:29.548 --> 17:34.470
(both)
Mmm. Foot-long chili dog.

17:38.599 --> 17:39.558

Mechanical humming sound)

It's a sign!

17:47.441 --> 17:50.736

17:53.489 --> 17:55.532
Good news, honey.
Two weeks are up.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.993
You don't have to wear
your glasses anymore.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.329
And your scalp
and posture seem fine.

18:00.412 --> 18:03.499
Yes!
(grunts)

18:03.582 --> 18:06.376
Kids, did anyone pray
for giant shoes?

18:06.460 --> 18:08.420
-I did!
-Okilly-dokilly.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.548
We've been doing a lot
of upper-body work on Bart.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.967

-Yeah.

Gentlemen, the nerd
you knew is dead.

18:24.228 --> 18:27.523
Beat me, and you will be
beating one of your own.

-Whatever.
