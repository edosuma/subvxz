00:19.119 --> 00:21.019
It's alive!

00:35.769 --> 00:36.827
Aah!

00:40.573 --> 00:41.835
Ahh.

00:45.512 --> 00:46.979
Welcome back to <i>First Date...</i>

00:47.013 --> 00:49.641
where we've already matched up
some unlikely couples...

00:49.682 --> 00:52.776
a geek with a beauty queen,
a basketball player with a dwarf...

00:52.819 --> 00:55.879
and <i>Jackass</i> star Steve-o
with someone who isn't a loser.

00:55.922 --> 00:58.447
But this time, we've outdone ourselves.

00:58.491 --> 01:00.118
Susan hails from Los Angeles...

01:00.160 --> 01:02.594
and, like all of us,
she's looking to be bitten...

01:02.629 --> 01:04.290
that is, smitten... by love.

01:04.330 --> 01:08.391
So I was, like, raised Jewish,
and family's very important to me.

01:08.435 --> 01:12.599
If my dad knew how important
sex was to me, I would die.

01:12.639 --> 01:15.506
Whew! Daddy's little princess
has a wild streak.

01:15.542 --> 01:17.339
Think we can find someone to tame her?

01:17.377 --> 01:19.436
Douglas is a Predator
from Newark, New Jersey...

01:19.479 --> 01:21.572
who prides himself
on his trophy collection.

01:21.614 --> 01:23.514
But are women
just part of the hunt for him?

01:23.550 --> 01:25.108
Sure, I respect women.

01:25.151 --> 01:28.609
One time, this girl I knew had big boobs,
and I respect that.

01:28.655 --> 01:29.883
I'm a gentleman.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.551
If someone disrespects my girl,
I'll skin him.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.957
You know, I'm sweet like that.

01:33.993 --> 01:36.257
One's an Alien, the other's a Predator.

01:36.296 --> 01:40.198
Will they have chemistry,
or is this a case of science friction?

01:42.702 --> 01:44.693
- Oh, hi.
- Oh, hi!

01:44.737 --> 01:47.228
- Are you Susan?
- Yes. Nice to meet you.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.241
I'm Douglas.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.243
Mmm, yeah.

01:51.277 --> 01:52.904
Beautiful day we're having.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.107
Yeah, yeah. It's great.

01:56.816 --> 01:59.284
So, what kind of guys
do you usually date?

01:59.319 --> 02:02.948
Oh, I don't know,
I don't really have a type.

02:02.989 --> 02:05.150
My father may not
approve of you though...

02:05.191 --> 02:07.751
since I'm Jewish,
and you're Predator-American.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.455
Oh, he's kind of protective, huh?

02:09.496 --> 02:12.226
Yeah, totally. He's kind of tough.

02:14.667 --> 02:18.603
So, how important is sex to you
in a relationship?

02:18.638 --> 02:21.903
Oh, I don't know,
pretty important, I guess.

02:21.941 --> 02:23.533
Yeah, I don't know
what I'd do without sex.

02:23.576 --> 02:25.043
I gotta have it all the time.

02:25.078 --> 02:26.568
All the time, huh?

02:29.415 --> 02:31.076
Hot tubs are nice, aren't they?

02:31.117 --> 02:34.780
I also love the way
the moonlight on the water...

02:34.821 --> 02:38.222
brings out the shine
on your chitinous shell.

02:38.258 --> 02:39.384
Aw.

02:41.294 --> 02:44.388
- Don't do it!
- You can do better!

02:44.430 --> 02:46.125
Ew! Yuck!

02:46.166 --> 02:48.760
So, it was really nice meeting you.

02:48.801 --> 02:51.770
You're, um, you're a really nice
person.

02:51.804 --> 02:53.101
Aah!

02:53.139 --> 02:55.198
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

02:55.241 --> 02:57.232
Are you OK?

02:57.277 --> 02:58.904
Um...

02:58.945 --> 03:01.175
Uh, you want a band-aid?

03:02.549 --> 03:05.450
Whoa!
That date didn't end well, did it, folks?

03:05.485 --> 03:08.045
Think they'll ever go out again?
Let's check back and ask them.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.320
Guess not.

03:20.366 --> 03:24.268
Hey, get away from the truck!
It's gonna blow!

03:24.304 --> 03:27.762
- Can anybody help this guy?
- Now's our chance, boys! Come on!

03:30.677 --> 03:32.668
Tetsuo

03:35.782 --> 03:38.114
Welcome back
to the <i>Carousel of Tomorrow...</i>

03:38.151 --> 03:40.711
where we look at humanity's
march into the future.

03:40.753 --> 03:45.247
Can you imagine, excited viewers,
what marvels the 21st century holds?

03:45.291 --> 03:46.417
Why, just imagine.

03:46.459 --> 03:51.294
The Chinese say they're going to land
a man on the moon by the year 2020.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.162
What will that be like, do you think?

03:57.237 --> 03:58.966
Inspiring.

03:59.005 --> 04:02.168
As we reach toward space,
we also look inward.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.800
The unlocking of the human genome...

04:03.843 --> 04:06.903
will allow the birth
of perfect babies in the future.

04:06.946 --> 04:09.710
Why, think of a world
without disease...

04:09.749 --> 04:10.773
or midgets...

04:10.817 --> 04:13.911
where every child
is perfect in every way.

04:13.953 --> 04:14.977
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

04:15.021 --> 04:18.512
And would you believe that as
high-speed internet access improves...

04:18.558 --> 04:22.255
doctors can perform complicated
surgeries without leaving the beach?

04:23.396 --> 04:24.795
You will.

04:26.633 --> 04:29.193
And in the future, virtual reality sex...

04:29.235 --> 04:33.638
will be perfected,
and society will be forever changed.

04:38.044 --> 04:39.705
Mr. Wembley?

04:39.746 --> 04:41.304
You like that, don't you, bitch?

04:41.347 --> 04:43.679
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

04:43.716 --> 04:45.377
Mayor McCheese! Mayor McCheese!

04:45.418 --> 04:47.318
How do your views differ
from Governor Schwarzenegger...

04:47.353 --> 04:50.652
given that he's a republican,
and you have a cheeseburger for a head?

04:50.690 --> 04:52.920
It's a birth defect!

04:52.959 --> 04:56.690
Oh, I've dealt with prejudice all my life...

04:56.729 --> 04:58.629
Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor!
There have been allegations...

04:58.665 --> 05:00.064
that you've taken women
to motel rooms...

05:00.099 --> 05:02.226
and paid them to go to the bathroom
on your chest.

05:04.437 --> 05:08.032
Uh, uh, robble, robble, robble, robble!

05:14.080 --> 05:17.709
Oh! Don't get any blood
on the new carpet!

05:17.750 --> 05:21.049
America's number one
Judaic super-spy is back in action!

05:21.087 --> 05:23.920
Never mess with a man's Roth I.R. A!

05:23.956 --> 05:27.255
Now, the hood-mounted Gatling guns
are quite deadly...

05:27.293 --> 05:28.988
How many miles per gallon?

05:29.028 --> 05:30.222
Er, twenty-five or so.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.696
Now, the smokescreen generator...

05:31.731 --> 05:33.790
Is that highway or city mileage?

05:38.971 --> 05:41.405
Do you expect me to talk, Goyfinger?

05:41.441 --> 05:45.138
No, Mr. Hashanah.
I expect you to eat this B.L. T!

05:45.178 --> 05:47.112
That's not Kosher! Ugh!

05:47.146 --> 05:50.946
This summer, get chillin' with the tefillin,
Ross Hashanah!

05:51.918 --> 05:56.218
I would gladly pay you Tuesday
for a hamburger today.

05:57.590 --> 05:59.888
Good morning, everyone!

05:59.926 --> 06:02.190
I would gladly pay you Tuesday...

06:02.228 --> 06:03.559
No deal, Wimpy!

06:03.596 --> 06:06.895
- Oh, no.
- Ha!

06:06.933 --> 06:10.232
No more hamburgers for old Wimpy.

06:10.269 --> 06:12.601
- Don't do that, dear boy.
- Why not?

06:12.638 --> 06:16.472
Why, just look at what everyone's lives
would be like without you.

06:16.509 --> 06:17.999
Without you. Without you.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.568
Good job, Bluto!

06:19.612 --> 06:21.307
Nice hair, Popeye!

06:21.347 --> 06:23.872
Bouncy, bouncy!

06:23.916 --> 06:27.374
Thanks for curing cancer,
Alice the Goon!

06:35.661 --> 06:37.822
Oh, well, sorry for wasting your time.

06:37.864 --> 06:40.128
- Huhh!
- Ohh!

06:40.166 --> 06:41.793
Hamburger!

07:42.895 --> 07:44.886
Ooh! Stix cereal!

07:44.931 --> 07:46.455
I gotta have some!

07:46.499 --> 07:49.093
Stupid bunny,
Stix are intended for children!

07:49.135 --> 07:51.262
- Just give me a little!
- He touched me inappropriately!

07:53.439 --> 07:56.237
Couldn't stay off the sugar, right?

07:56.275 --> 07:58.072
But I can't help myself.

07:58.110 --> 08:01.602
My mother ate sugar
when she was pregnant with me.

08:02.615 --> 08:06.676
You want to control the sugar?
Stop using and start selling.

08:06.719 --> 08:08.516
Here, look this guy up when you're out.

08:08.554 --> 08:10.784
- Rabbit, you're out.
- R-Really?

08:10.823 --> 08:12.256
But it's only been an hour.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.225
You in Alabama, fool.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.228
An hour's all you get for touching a child.

08:18.297 --> 08:20.265
Selling's a dangerous business, Rabbit...

08:20.299 --> 08:22.859
killed the Fruit Brute, Yummy Mummy,
and even the Cinnamonkey.

08:22.902 --> 08:25.427
I can handle it. Where's the stuff?

08:25.471 --> 08:27.530
We'll just follow my snout!

08:27.573 --> 08:28.733
It's never in doubt!

08:28.774 --> 08:31.868
Snout that big,
it should know more than Einstein.

08:31.911 --> 08:33.707
Kill that mother...

08:51.564 --> 08:53.395
We'll just follow my snout!

08:56.335 --> 08:57.632
Wow.

08:57.670 --> 09:00.298
Do you have any idea
how rich I'm gonna be...

09:00.339 --> 09:02.307
selling all this cocaine... sugar?

09:02.341 --> 09:05.401
I meant to say sugar.

09:05.444 --> 09:07.139
Sugar.

09:07.179 --> 09:09.010
OK?

09:09.048 --> 09:10.072
OK.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.734
I tell you the bleedin' boys
were followin' me around...

09:30.770 --> 09:33.466
and one little brasser says,
"We're after your charms!"

09:33.506 --> 09:36.737
So, I says, "Forget about
me blue diamonds...

09:36.776 --> 09:39.904
and worry about
me blue balls, ya whore!"

09:41.213 --> 09:42.646
Oh, yeah!

09:44.083 --> 09:46.278
I never have any idea
what you're saying.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.379
Bad news, boss.
The Rice boys are talkin' to the cops.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.219
Bastards are always talking!

09:51.257 --> 09:53.521
OK, OK! I'll crack!

09:53.559 --> 09:54.890
- I'll crinkle!
- I'll plop!

09:54.927 --> 09:58.363
The Stix rabbit made us sell the stuff!

09:58.397 --> 10:02.390
Uh, we only brought you in here
'cause someone turned in your wallet.

10:05.338 --> 10:08.535
Heh, heh. I must've lost it.

10:13.379 --> 10:15.142
Use the hollow-point bullets!

10:15.181 --> 10:16.808
They're groovy!

10:21.187 --> 10:24.418
Their bones'll stay crunchy,
even when soaked in blood!

10:24.457 --> 10:25.481
Ha ha ha!

10:30.796 --> 10:33.390
Don't shoot! I give up!

10:33.432 --> 10:35.923
He's giving up! Shoot him!

10:38.404 --> 10:40.201
Huh? What? But I...

10:40.239 --> 10:42.469
Oh!

10:43.509 --> 10:44.874
Finally!

10:44.910 --> 10:48.710
Stupid bunny,
Stix are intended for children.

10:48.748 --> 10:53.685
No!

11:08.534 --> 11:10.024
- Ba-gawk!
- Bock.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.234
Stupid monkey.
