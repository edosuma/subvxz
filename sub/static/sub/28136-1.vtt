02:37.259 --> 02:38.327
Take her alive.

04:10.611 --> 04:11.378
Stop.

04:12.546 --> 04:14.413
Now, who might you be?

04:14.415 --> 04:15.249
Who's asking?

04:16.283 --> 04:17.851
I'm the one who's asking.

04:17.884 --> 04:18.885
Are you a Christian?

04:23.223 --> 04:24.357
My sword is my god.

04:25.591 --> 04:27.293
What do you have there?

04:29.895 --> 04:30.729
Bastard!

04:32.764 --> 04:34.399
We'll kill you, bastard!

04:37.602 --> 04:38.871
What's wrong with you?

04:39.972 --> 04:41.140
I don't want that here.

04:45.543 --> 04:46.377
It's a woman?

04:50.314 --> 04:52.150
No, you should not have come.

04:52.216 --> 04:54.784
This village is full of
only death and horrors.

04:56.753 --> 04:57.587
Oh, my.

04:58.721 --> 04:59.823
How did this happen?

05:02.292 --> 05:03.093
Who is she?

05:11.968 --> 05:14.136
It's a warning, no doubt.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.307
This is Freya.

05:21.309 --> 05:23.845
Her sister's Gudrun
the Fearless,

05:23.912 --> 05:25.613
who's said to be the
daughter of a Valkyrie

05:25.646 --> 05:27.580
for real, and in battle.

05:27.582 --> 05:29.482
She is a fierce shield-maiden

05:29.484 --> 05:31.818
who brought the Christian
god to our village.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.486
So why this?

05:34.488 --> 05:36.656
Oh, no, you should
not have come.

05:36.690 --> 05:38.525
You should leave as
soon as possible.

05:39.459 --> 05:40.360
I urge you.

05:42.128 --> 05:44.962
No, no, no, no, no, no!

05:44.964 --> 05:47.298
Tell me
the story, old man,

05:47.300 --> 05:48.634
and get me some mead and food.

05:48.667 --> 05:50.167
I'm parched and starving.

05:50.169 --> 05:51.337
Yes, of course.

05:56.474 --> 05:57.809
Something to drink.

05:57.842 --> 05:59.211
Something to eat.

06:00.812 --> 06:04.614
It all began when
Gudrun and the earl

06:04.616 --> 06:06.783
went to raid in England.

06:07.818 --> 06:08.650
The earl?

06:08.652 --> 06:10.152
Yes, yeah.

06:10.154 --> 06:12.656
In this town, the earl and
the Lord is the same person.

06:12.689 --> 06:14.158
His name is Odinsson.

06:16.027 --> 06:20.163
Yes, he's true to the old
godsend, despises the Christians.

06:21.731 --> 06:24.968
Gudrun and the earl, they stayed
in England for many years.

06:25.001 --> 06:27.201
Gudrun fell in love
with a Christian man.

06:27.203 --> 06:29.972
Yeah, she began to replace
Odin the Allfather,

06:30.005 --> 06:32.341
and the other gods, with
the one Christian god.

06:34.876 --> 06:36.878
Odinsson was not pleased,

06:36.912 --> 06:41.150
so he killed Gudrun's
Christian man.

06:41.183 --> 06:42.548
Yes.

06:42.550 --> 06:44.185
On her return, she
gathered all her followers

06:44.218 --> 06:46.318
and established a
Christian church

06:46.320 --> 06:48.320
on the other side of town.

06:48.322 --> 06:49.924
There have been
a war ever since.

06:51.725 --> 06:53.494
Is this Gudrun wealthy?

06:53.527 --> 06:56.361
Ah, it's said she brought
with her much wealth

06:56.363 --> 06:58.431
from the churches in England.

06:59.899 --> 07:01.066
Yes.

07:01.068 --> 07:03.103
But most of it was
confiscated by Odinsson.

07:04.904 --> 07:06.705
I think I shall
go and see her.

07:06.738 --> 07:08.405
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

07:08.407 --> 07:10.607
No, no, you should
leave at sunset.

07:10.609 --> 07:12.411
No, no, they will kill you.

07:13.545 --> 07:14.546
I think I'll stay.

07:15.581 --> 07:17.746
Sounds like a
profitable place to be.

07:17.748 --> 07:18.749
Keep her safe.

08:19.139 --> 08:21.605
Are you Christian?

08:21.607 --> 08:23.276
I am whatever
you want me to be.

08:24.477 --> 08:25.445
Why are you here?

08:26.846 --> 08:29.415
I found a woman tied
to a cross in the forest.

08:30.749 --> 08:32.616
I'm told she's your sister.

08:32.650 --> 08:33.450
Freya?

08:33.452 --> 08:34.917
Where is she?

08:34.919 --> 08:36.153
Safe.

08:36.155 --> 08:37.489
For now.

08:37.522 --> 08:38.690
And the priests?

08:38.756 --> 08:40.792
I don't
know about any priests.

08:42.293 --> 08:43.991
I demand that you
bring her back immediately.

08:43.994 --> 08:45.196
Easy.

08:45.263 --> 08:47.965
Easy.

08:47.998 --> 08:48.832
I will.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.935
But she will cost you
30 pieces of silver.

08:54.037 --> 08:55.338
I will not pay you that.

08:56.939 --> 08:59.707
I'm sure the earl
will be happy to pay me.

08:59.709 --> 09:00.677
Bastard.

09:02.812 --> 09:04.781
If you don't want
your sister back...

09:08.317 --> 09:09.151
Pay him.

09:21.229 --> 09:22.897
This better not be deceit.

09:24.699 --> 09:25.533
It's not.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.582
Helga.

09:52.691 --> 09:54.159
Profitable town.

10:00.998 --> 10:03.099
You're a
heartless mongrel.

10:03.101 --> 10:06.103
Careful what you say, Agnir,
or I'll have your tongue.

10:12.509 --> 10:13.675
Tell me about Odinsson.

10:13.677 --> 10:15.512
Sounds like someone
I should meet.

10:15.546 --> 10:18.011
He's not someone you
should be playing with.

10:18.013 --> 10:21.184
His hound, Tor, will
certainly kill you.

10:22.452 --> 10:23.719
I don't ask much of you.

10:26.922 --> 10:28.055
Maiden.

10:28.057 --> 10:29.689
I am no maiden.

10:29.691 --> 10:33.362
I am Astrid, and I, too,
am the sister of Gudrun.

10:33.395 --> 10:34.863
She wishes to speak with you.

10:35.964 --> 10:37.799
If she has silver,
I have a sword.

10:39.968 --> 10:41.136
Then come now.

10:48.476 --> 10:51.379
I would like to thank you
personally again for my sister.

10:52.913 --> 10:55.315
It is truly horrible what
those heathens did to her.

10:57.584 --> 10:59.917
I would like to make a proposal.

10:59.919 --> 11:01.452
What kind of proposal?

11:01.454 --> 11:03.656
Join with the side of
God, and revenge her.

11:04.957 --> 11:07.125
And help us drive the
heathen off this land.

11:08.394 --> 11:09.395
Sounds reasonable.

11:10.796 --> 11:13.330
What would you say
that's worth to you?

11:13.332 --> 11:15.234
I can offer you
20 pieces of silver.

11:18.336 --> 11:19.337
I'll do it for 80.

11:24.509 --> 11:25.743
80?

11:25.776 --> 11:27.976
Half now and half
when the deed is done.

11:27.978 --> 11:29.446
That's too much.

11:29.479 --> 11:31.748
- I just paid you for...
- For your sister's life.

11:33.149 --> 11:34.416
30, then.

11:34.418 --> 11:35.685
With room and board.

11:37.521 --> 11:38.355
40.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.824
60!

11:40.857 --> 11:42.191
60 pieces of silver.

11:47.663 --> 11:48.831
And I'll take a room.

12:08.382 --> 12:10.349
Who tied up the pretty
girl in the forest?

12:10.351 --> 12:12.118
Must have been you and you.

12:12.152 --> 12:13.452
And me!

13:11.006 --> 13:12.408
30 silver pieces.

13:13.609 --> 13:14.543
Swift work.

13:20.348 --> 13:23.851
You have revenged Freya's
dignity, and have earned my trust.

13:33.226 --> 13:34.060
Helga?

13:36.396 --> 13:37.397
Show him to his room.

13:58.950 --> 14:00.752
Is he in his room?

14:00.785 --> 14:01.986
Yes.

14:04.088 --> 14:05.089
What makes
you think he's not

14:05.122 --> 14:06.256
the devil in disguise?

14:10.961 --> 14:13.495
I don't think we can
trust the stranger.

14:13.497 --> 14:15.832
We don't even know his name.

14:17.567 --> 14:19.234
Did you see his ring?

14:21.504 --> 14:23.003
Yes.

14:23.005 --> 14:25.007
Probably
stolen or ill-gotten.

14:30.278 --> 14:32.313
We cannot risk
everything we fought for.

14:34.983 --> 14:36.115
We should kill him in his sleep.

14:36.117 --> 14:36.951
Astrid!

14:38.119 --> 14:39.521
God brought him to
us for a reason.

14:40.689 --> 14:42.089
Would that reason
be to kill him?

14:43.524 --> 14:45.493
Where are the priests, then?

14:46.660 --> 14:48.494
Who's to say he
did not kill them?

14:48.496 --> 14:50.364
As well as take our
sister for ransom.

14:52.032 --> 14:53.664
We shall wait
until Freya's awake

14:53.666 --> 14:55.868
before making any
rash decisions.

14:55.935 --> 14:57.437
He is of use to us for now.

14:58.838 --> 15:01.539
Of course, my hope is that
the word of our plight

15:01.541 --> 15:03.275
reach our brothers
across the sea.

15:04.844 --> 15:06.976
What about the 60
pieces of silver?

15:06.978 --> 15:08.146
You've already paid him.

15:09.515 --> 15:10.682
We could get that back.

15:12.518 --> 15:13.852
Come on, Gudrun.

15:15.487 --> 15:16.822
Let me kill him.

15:18.689 --> 15:19.890
Fine.

15:19.957 --> 15:21.459
Fine.

20:09.622 --> 20:12.959
The warrior will disturb

20:14.060 --> 20:17.396
the balance of the gods.

20:19.799 --> 20:24.636
I see a man from far away lands

20:26.972 --> 20:28.573
with no faith.

20:29.573 --> 20:31.743
He's not the common man.

20:34.645 --> 20:35.579
What do you mean?

20:37.148 --> 20:40.816
I can only tell
you what I see.

20:40.818 --> 20:45.155
I cannot decipher its meaning.

20:45.188 --> 20:47.290
Many will die.

20:53.095 --> 20:55.431
Be warned, you must kill him.

20:57.033 --> 20:59.501
If not, you yourself will die.

21:35.234 --> 21:36.402
Many will die.

22:06.096 --> 22:07.097
Leaving us already?

22:09.900 --> 22:11.567
I told you he
couldn't be trusted.

22:22.744 --> 22:25.846
I will not be stabbed
in the back as I sleep.

22:25.848 --> 22:27.883
I'll keep the 30
pieces for your sister.

22:29.083 --> 22:30.051
How did you...

22:37.091 --> 22:37.959
Coward!

22:46.566 --> 22:47.600
Fine work, Astrid.

22:49.302 --> 22:50.468
This is not a warrior

22:50.470 --> 22:52.139
we want roaming around
causing trouble.

22:53.605 --> 22:56.375
Odinsson will come down
hard on us for the killings.

22:56.408 --> 22:58.244
You're not my sister.

22:58.277 --> 23:00.945
We will learn the truth
from Freya when she's awake.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.882
We still have the support
of the blacksmith.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.648
There can be no war
without good weapons.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.584
Keep that
information between us.

23:07.552 --> 23:08.820
Must not be openly known.

23:09.787 --> 23:10.956
His support depends on it.

23:38.982 --> 23:39.815
You?

23:40.815 --> 23:42.317
I thought you had been killed.

23:43.185 --> 23:44.350
I would let you know.

23:45.620 --> 23:47.087
I need some food and mead.

23:47.089 --> 23:48.188
It's been a long day.

23:48.190 --> 23:49.524
Yes, of course.

23:52.594 --> 23:54.962
Will you be resting
here tonight?

23:54.996 --> 23:56.495
I might.

23:56.497 --> 23:57.331
Yes.

24:18.483 --> 24:20.785
What is your experience
with these Christians?

24:21.786 --> 24:22.955
Oof.

24:24.356 --> 24:26.558
I think they would prefer to
live their lives in peace,

24:26.625 --> 24:27.993
'cause they were, of
course, all followers

24:28.027 --> 24:29.560
of the old gods before.

24:31.062 --> 24:34.865
But I don't think you can
change faith so easily.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.835
I saw Astrid speaking
to the seer today.

24:39.037 --> 24:41.471
I don't think Odin
would look kindly

24:41.504 --> 24:44.305
on a Christian using his gifts.

24:44.307 --> 24:47.375
She's certainly doesn't
seem very Christian to me.

24:47.377 --> 24:48.811
But then again,
it seems this god

24:48.845 --> 24:51.046
is no different than the others.

24:51.048 --> 24:54.483
They make believers do
bad deeds in their name.

24:54.516 --> 24:56.018
Perhaps it's just an excuse?

24:58.387 --> 24:59.920
I tell you this, Agnir,

24:59.922 --> 25:02.891
this village will much better
off with these gods gone.

25:09.564 --> 25:13.734
It shall be my gift to you,
to get rid of them all.

25:16.736 --> 25:19.237
You're a crazy bastard.

25:19.239 --> 25:21.441
And I'm certain
you will be killed.

25:27.714 --> 25:31.250
But you should get
a better sword.

25:32.418 --> 25:33.917
The blacksmith here in town

25:33.919 --> 25:36.587
is the most skilled
in the whole kingdom.

25:36.589 --> 25:39.558
His work is praised even
by the king himself.

25:41.259 --> 25:42.094
Is that so?

25:44.262 --> 25:46.098
to that.

26:04.947 --> 26:06.114
A good morning to you.

26:06.116 --> 26:07.715
How was your rest?

26:07.717 --> 26:08.949
Sound.

26:08.951 --> 26:11.988
Ah, today's gonna be
a busy day, then, huh?

26:22.964 --> 26:27.402
Here, my friend, a warm
drink to get you on your way.

26:37.145 --> 26:38.079
Good man.

27:32.861 --> 27:34.029
Lock in the light.

27:44.406 --> 27:45.707
Much work to be done here.

27:46.908 --> 27:48.076
A storm is coming.

27:55.216 --> 27:58.185
Agnir told me you're the
finest craftsman in the kingdom.

28:03.257 --> 28:04.590
Your fame precedes you.

28:05.725 --> 28:06.892
It usually does.

28:08.861 --> 28:10.494
People have been talking,

28:10.496 --> 28:15.233
the way that you
killed Odinsson's men

28:15.235 --> 28:16.868
made them look weak.

28:19.838 --> 28:20.672
Why are you here?

28:22.541 --> 28:25.408
I'm just here to make a
few coins like everyone else.

28:25.410 --> 28:26.511
But I need an upgrade.

28:33.184 --> 28:34.218
Fine work.

28:35.619 --> 28:37.288
Almost looks like one of my own.

28:39.757 --> 28:41.258
It's seen some action, though.

28:42.392 --> 28:43.393
It's an old sword.

28:48.097 --> 28:49.466
Was my father's before me.

28:52.434 --> 28:53.269
Mm.

29:01.377 --> 29:02.911
I might have something for you.

29:12.420 --> 29:14.789
What do you
mean by "a storm is coming"?

29:17.791 --> 29:20.059
One will
have to choose sides.

29:22.462 --> 29:24.898
Which
side do you choose?

29:24.931 --> 29:26.498
War's good for me.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.434
Whichever side ultimately wins.

29:33.406 --> 29:34.907
I just make the weapons.

29:47.185 --> 29:48.820
Now, that is a sword.

29:55.759 --> 29:58.128
Her name is Grim.

29:58.161 --> 30:00.497
She was forged of iron
not of this world.

30:02.032 --> 30:06.536
Only the fires of hell
were hot enough to melt it.

30:08.137 --> 30:10.306
How much do you want for it?

30:15.010 --> 30:16.778
It is a sword for the worthy.

30:19.180 --> 30:23.385
Any payment is purely
a gesture of respect.

30:25.153 --> 30:25.987
Blacksmith?

30:27.489 --> 30:28.289
Yes, Olav?

30:30.023 --> 30:30.858
And the sword?

30:33.527 --> 30:34.862
100 pieces of silver.

30:38.031 --> 30:38.899
Stranger.

30:40.067 --> 30:41.968
The earl wants to
see you in his hole.

30:42.001 --> 30:42.835
Let's go.

30:44.237 --> 30:45.071
Great.

30:47.340 --> 30:48.841
Leave the sword here.

30:53.479 --> 30:54.680
Take care of it for me.

30:55.881 --> 30:57.215
I shall be back to get her.

31:27.411 --> 31:29.111
My lord, this is the stranger

31:29.177 --> 31:32.681
that killed three of our men.

31:33.716 --> 31:36.683
So you are the
famous stranger.

31:36.685 --> 31:40.420
It seems you have already caused
quite the stir in my town.

31:40.422 --> 31:43.358
He killed three of our
men at the front gates.

31:44.592 --> 31:47.393
So in the tower,
was that you too?

31:47.395 --> 31:49.731
I should really
kill you for that.

31:49.764 --> 31:52.931
They insulted me when
I arrived to this town.

31:52.933 --> 31:54.768
It is my right to defend myself.

31:56.803 --> 31:59.938
It's not my fault that
your men cannot fight.

32:02.476 --> 32:04.077
Listen to him.

32:05.611 --> 32:07.146
What do you want?

32:07.212 --> 32:09.480
500 pieces of silver
for the information

32:09.482 --> 32:10.883
I'm about to give you.

32:10.916 --> 32:13.419
You better bring me
Gudrun's head for that price.

32:20.291 --> 32:21.626
There are ships arriving.

32:23.261 --> 32:24.128
Let him pass.

32:25.129 --> 32:25.997
What ships?

32:30.768 --> 32:32.436
The king's ships.

32:33.837 --> 32:35.839
If this turns out to be false,

32:37.007 --> 32:39.677
I will have you fileted
like a bloody cod.

32:48.150 --> 32:49.684
Feels a bit light.

32:49.686 --> 32:51.253
It is 50.

32:51.287 --> 32:52.788
You can come back for the rest.

32:56.658 --> 32:57.493
Very well.

32:58.460 --> 32:59.461
I'll be going, then.

33:01.497 --> 33:03.932
We confiscated your
horse so you don't run off.

33:14.174 --> 33:15.009
My lord.

33:16.142 --> 33:19.713
We will have to make
use of this information.

33:23.950 --> 33:25.850
Inform Tor to take

33:25.852 --> 33:28.685
a troop of his best
warriors to the beach.

33:28.687 --> 33:31.390
It's the only place they
can possibly land close by.

33:32.625 --> 33:35.127
And get someone
back in the tower.

33:35.160 --> 33:36.495
My lord, it's done.

33:42.199 --> 33:43.901
Our situation has changed.

33:46.337 --> 33:49.371
Go and invite Gudrun
and her closest flank

33:49.373 --> 33:50.542
for a feast tonight.

33:51.843 --> 33:54.643
We shall make peace
with the Christians.

33:54.645 --> 33:55.479
Peace?

33:57.180 --> 33:58.915
After what she's
done to this town?

34:01.317 --> 34:03.987
We must run them
out, and kill them.

34:06.355 --> 34:09.190
In due time, my wife.

34:09.224 --> 34:10.658
A plan is underway.

34:10.659 --> 34:12.327
Just do as I ask.

34:13.763 --> 34:15.431
I will trust that.

35:25.495 --> 35:26.596
It's a small garden.

35:29.598 --> 35:33.734
They must have split up the
troops to protect the ships.

35:33.736 --> 35:35.638
Mm-hm.

36:04.664 --> 36:06.866
Valuable information indeed.

36:08.534 --> 36:10.603
I've changed my mind
about you, Stranger.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.172
I will pay you to work for me.

36:14.373 --> 36:16.038
That's very good and well,

36:16.040 --> 36:17.642
but you're in a
truce, are you not?

36:18.943 --> 36:20.111
What will you have me do?

36:22.113 --> 36:24.348
There shall be
bloodshed soon enough,

36:25.383 --> 36:26.718
and I will need your sword.

36:28.385 --> 36:30.721
Here are 50 gold pieces.

36:32.189 --> 36:34.858
That should suffice and cover
the rest of the payment.

36:37.160 --> 36:38.128
Very generous.

36:39.229 --> 36:40.897
I shall need my
horse back as well.

36:42.799 --> 36:43.833
Get him his horse.

36:46.636 --> 36:48.202
Much obliged.

36:48.204 --> 36:49.505
I'm at your service.

36:49.538 --> 36:51.040
Don't stray too far.

36:55.143 --> 36:55.911
My lady.

38:06.441 --> 38:07.710
We're saved.

38:09.078 --> 38:11.444
Good to see you
finally awake, my sister.

38:11.446 --> 38:15.317
The bishop has come across the
narrow sea at my invitation.

38:15.384 --> 38:17.886
The king has agreed
to dispatch an escort.

38:17.919 --> 38:18.987
They come in force.

38:25.960 --> 38:27.095
Bless you, my child,

38:28.228 --> 38:30.230
for having suffered
the pain of our savior.

38:32.232 --> 38:33.566
Thank you, Father.

38:36.069 --> 38:37.568
We have to know what
happened to our brothers

38:37.570 --> 38:38.638
when you left England.

38:40.840 --> 38:43.575
We haven't heard a word, and
after seeing you like this,

38:45.845 --> 38:47.013
I do fear the worst.

38:49.315 --> 38:54.083
I tried to protect them,
but there were just too many.

38:54.085 --> 38:55.518
Who were they?

38:55.520 --> 38:57.355
They must have
been the earl's men.

38:59.490 --> 39:01.292
I saw the devil's face.

39:06.030 --> 39:07.698
Tell us what
happened, my child.

39:09.700 --> 39:10.968
Brother Richard was hit.

39:13.470 --> 39:16.871
Edwin and I, we tried
to hide in the woods.

39:16.873 --> 39:19.375
And I managed to
kill one of them,

39:19.442 --> 39:24.447
but as Edwyn ran off,

39:25.181 --> 39:26.015
he took an arrow, so...

39:29.284 --> 39:32.054
I could still hear him
screaming as I was knocked out.

39:36.992 --> 39:38.393
So he may still be alive.

39:41.362 --> 39:42.964
Do you know where they took him?

39:44.131 --> 39:46.033
No, I don't,

39:47.534 --> 39:49.703
but maybe the man who saved me?

39:52.172 --> 39:53.473
There might be hope yet.

39:54.875 --> 39:56.040
Rest now, Freya.

39:56.042 --> 39:56.877
Get well.

39:58.711 --> 39:59.712
Peace be with you.

40:02.215 --> 40:03.416
Thank you.

40:03.483 --> 40:05.050
We will pray for
your speedy recover.

40:08.988 --> 40:10.722
There must be a reckoning.

40:14.526 --> 40:15.992
We must find our brother

40:15.994 --> 40:19.261
and avenge the death of
Richard in the name of God.

40:19.263 --> 40:23.167
This blasphemy
cannot go unpunished.

40:23.201 --> 40:27.536
My dearest bishop,
we are all outraged

40:27.538 --> 40:31.106
and agree that this
is a delicate matter.

40:31.108 --> 40:33.010
We have just made
peace with Odinsson,

40:34.411 --> 40:36.912
and we cannot just break
that peace without a cause.

40:36.914 --> 40:38.515
Without a cause?

40:38.548 --> 40:40.382
Have you seen what
they did to Freya?

40:43.920 --> 40:46.053
Let me try and find out
where Brother Edwyn is,

40:46.055 --> 40:48.724
and we shall take action
based upon that information.

40:50.059 --> 40:52.560
This is Denmark, not England.

40:52.593 --> 40:54.129
The old gods still reside here.

40:55.696 --> 40:56.965
We must tread with cunning.

41:00.735 --> 41:01.769
I hope you're right.

41:19.285 --> 41:20.584
Show restraint.

41:20.586 --> 41:22.286
Gudrun, this is good.

41:22.288 --> 41:24.223
We can finally take what's ours.

41:24.257 --> 41:27.424
We cannot allow ourselves
to fall into the old ways.

41:27.426 --> 41:30.293
We're at peace with Odinsson,
and so it shall remain.

41:30.295 --> 41:31.563
But we now have enough men

41:31.596 --> 41:34.898
to rid the town of the
earl and his old gods.

41:34.900 --> 41:36.468
It is not the Christian way.

41:37.836 --> 41:40.571
We cannot ask the king's escort
to fight against Odinsson.

41:40.604 --> 41:43.274
He's the earl, and pays
tribute to the king.

41:44.741 --> 41:46.010
I shall see him converted.

41:47.811 --> 41:50.647
It is a dream,
Gudrun, nothing more.

41:51.814 --> 41:53.314
The sooner you come
to accept that,

41:53.316 --> 41:55.651
the greater the chance
that we will survive this.

41:56.752 --> 41:58.254
We must destroy them.

41:59.755 --> 42:03.126
We shall pray and feast
tonight, for we're together.

42:03.159 --> 42:05.460
And the good men who have
come must be thirsty.

42:06.962 --> 42:09.464
God will reveal his
wishes in due time.

42:09.498 --> 42:13.335
Meanwhile, go find the
stranger and invite him here.

42:14.803 --> 42:16.437
We must find out what he knows.

43:32.174 --> 43:33.875
The wife!

43:40.181 --> 43:43.017
Oh, he knows more
about that than I do!

43:46.853 --> 43:48.253
To the king!

43:48.255 --> 43:50.591
I don't spend so
much time home with the wife.

43:50.624 --> 43:53.124
He spends more time
with ours than I do!

43:56.129 --> 43:57.463
Not even an invitation.

44:00.100 --> 44:01.299
We should go there right now

44:01.301 --> 44:03.635
and make Gudrun pay
for her insolence.

44:03.702 --> 44:06.871
We shall not partake in
their premature celebration.

44:07.772 --> 44:09.441
It is sure to be short-lived.

44:11.743 --> 44:13.810
This shall be the last supper.

44:13.812 --> 44:15.446
May Odin prove you right.

44:16.614 --> 44:17.881
It has been foretold.

44:25.990 --> 44:26.824
Mm.

44:38.335 --> 44:39.633
Wait here.

44:39.635 --> 44:40.969
I'll get Gudrun.

44:50.946 --> 44:51.779
He's here.

45:09.196 --> 45:10.830
It's not poisoned.

45:17.636 --> 45:20.003
How's your sister?

45:20.005 --> 45:21.207
Walk with me.

45:23.876 --> 45:26.445
Freya's recovering,
thanks to you.

45:27.645 --> 45:28.980
She was
worth the effort.

45:33.551 --> 45:36.821
You are perhaps more
than just a sword?

45:38.290 --> 45:40.222
Perhaps I'm just
the answer to your prayers.

45:41.692 --> 45:43.192
The Lord delivers.

45:43.194 --> 45:44.195
And if he doesn't?

45:45.396 --> 45:46.230
It's his will?

45:49.866 --> 45:54.337
There were priests traveling
with Freya from England.

45:54.370 --> 45:58.038
We have reason to believe that
one of them is still alive.

45:58.040 --> 45:59.842
I would like for
you to go find him.

46:01.043 --> 46:02.678
What makes you think
I would be interested?

46:02.712 --> 46:05.312
There would, of course,
be a generous bounty for you

46:05.314 --> 46:06.813
should you succeed.

46:06.815 --> 46:09.651
He is of utmost importance.

46:10.885 --> 46:12.521
He carries knowledge
about the faith.

46:12.554 --> 46:13.922
It needs to be written down.

46:15.489 --> 46:17.091
I'll go and have a look.

47:09.273 --> 47:14.211
You are a very
expensive bread knife.

47:21.584 --> 47:24.050
You may still live.

47:24.052 --> 47:25.921
Five days gone and
the peace holds.

47:29.123 --> 47:30.658
It is a false peace.

47:32.093 --> 47:35.094
Don't be so down just
because your plan didn't work.

47:35.096 --> 47:36.296
Be happy.

47:36.298 --> 47:37.632
You still have your life.

47:56.148 --> 47:57.350
It won't be long now!

48:04.623 --> 48:05.524
Freya, my dear.

48:06.691 --> 48:08.193
It's good to see
you up and about.

48:09.093 --> 48:10.295
You have recovered fast.

48:11.496 --> 48:13.498
It must have been
your prayers, Sister.

48:15.165 --> 48:16.432
Where's the man who saved me?

48:16.434 --> 48:18.769
I want to thank him properly.

48:18.802 --> 48:20.938
He's here, in the village.

48:22.673 --> 48:25.476
And this peace that
you make with the earl,

48:25.509 --> 48:26.810
do you think it will last?

48:28.177 --> 48:31.381
God wills it, and
the bishop commends it.

48:33.283 --> 48:36.118
Is it God who wills
it, or someone else?

48:37.387 --> 48:38.388
They're treacherous.

48:40.389 --> 48:41.657
We must see it through.

48:42.691 --> 48:43.557
To what end?

48:56.571 --> 48:58.203
I must see the bishop!

48:58.205 --> 48:59.407
What's happened?

48:59.474 --> 49:01.307
We were attacked at night.

49:01.309 --> 49:02.875
A few men are still
protecting the ships,

49:02.877 --> 49:05.812
but it will not be long
before they will overpower us.

49:07.013 --> 49:08.682
You must release
the king's guard.

49:09.816 --> 49:10.748
Thorkil, with haste!

49:10.750 --> 49:12.552
Of course.

49:14.888 --> 49:15.754
Heathens.

49:21.827 --> 49:24.229
When the king hears
this, he will send an army.

49:25.398 --> 49:28.230
We are under his protection.

49:28.232 --> 49:29.164
I told you!

49:29.166 --> 49:30.602
This is Odinsson's doing!

49:56.091 --> 49:56.926
Bastard.

51:22.004 --> 51:23.136
Shh, shh.

51:23.138 --> 51:24.771
Shh, I need to talk to you.

51:24.773 --> 51:26.339
You, it was you.

51:26.341 --> 51:27.509
Listen.

51:27.542 --> 51:29.544
Wait, I wanted to
thank you for saving me.

51:30.678 --> 51:32.177
That was a noble act.

51:32.179 --> 51:33.615
We don't have much time.

51:33.648 --> 51:34.980
Gudrun told me about
the two priests

51:34.982 --> 51:37.182
who were with you in the forest.

51:37.184 --> 51:39.183
You didn't know about them?

51:39.185 --> 51:41.655
One dead, and one
you last saw alive.

51:41.688 --> 51:42.523
Yeah.

51:44.625 --> 51:45.557
I think I know where he is.

51:45.559 --> 51:46.393
Edwyn.

51:47.694 --> 51:49.463
- Shh.
- Is Edwyn still alive?

51:49.496 --> 51:50.996
Maybe, maybe not.

51:52.398 --> 51:54.197
When I saw the silver
cross on the bishop,

51:54.199 --> 51:56.502
I knew I'd seen the
same cross before.

51:57.570 --> 51:59.138
We need to tell my sisters.

51:59.171 --> 52:02.475
If I find him, meet me at
the trading post at sundown.

53:00.294 --> 53:01.428
Who are you?

53:04.030 --> 53:07.567
We don't
have time for questions.

53:07.601 --> 53:08.432
- Thank you.
- Come.

53:08.434 --> 53:10.069
Thank you.

53:13.206 --> 53:14.871
Who is it?

53:14.873 --> 53:15.741
It's me.

53:15.774 --> 53:16.609
Open up.

53:29.086 --> 53:30.087
What have you done?

53:31.989 --> 53:33.489
He saved my life.

53:33.491 --> 53:35.326
He's a messenger from God.

53:35.392 --> 53:36.626
Enough of that.

53:36.628 --> 53:37.962
Give this man a
drink and some food.

53:37.995 --> 53:38.995
Of course.

53:41.632 --> 53:42.899
Freya's coming soon.

53:44.568 --> 53:45.634
I'll be back.

53:45.636 --> 53:47.904
Freya, she still alive?

53:47.938 --> 53:48.772
Yes.

53:51.140 --> 53:51.974
Oh, thank you.

53:55.611 --> 53:57.077
Thank you.

53:57.079 --> 53:59.515
You look like
you haven't eaten for days.

54:08.790 --> 54:09.591
Edwyn.

54:10.992 --> 54:11.858
You're alive.

54:11.860 --> 54:13.325
And you.

54:13.327 --> 54:14.328
What happened to you?

54:14.362 --> 54:15.763
Here, have a seat.

54:18.999 --> 54:21.199
After they shot me, I was
sure they were going to kill me,

54:21.201 --> 54:26.206
but a stranger saved
me from my prison.

54:30.376 --> 54:32.612
Seems we have the same savior.

54:32.645 --> 54:33.443
We don't have much time.

54:33.445 --> 54:34.380
Here, take this.

54:35.815 --> 54:36.649
What is that?

54:43.188 --> 54:45.188
I cannot take this.

54:45.190 --> 54:47.292
This belongs to the
bishop to the church.

54:47.325 --> 54:50.226
You have to take it,
and you have to leave now.

54:50.228 --> 54:54.832
This is a tribute to
Odinsson to keep the peace,

54:54.865 --> 54:56.400
but he has betrayed your faith.

54:57.835 --> 54:59.003
But what about Gudrun?

54:59.036 --> 55:01.806
Freya, listen, they
realize he's gone.

55:02.806 --> 55:04.071
You're not safe here.

55:04.073 --> 55:06.509
The king's men
will protect us.

55:06.542 --> 55:08.710
The king's men are dead.

55:08.712 --> 55:10.479
They're not coming back.

55:10.513 --> 55:11.648
We must leave now.

55:19.655 --> 55:21.657
God bless you.

55:25.527 --> 55:28.160
Go north and
stay in the forest.

55:28.162 --> 55:29.662
Keep off the path,

55:29.664 --> 55:32.598
and do not stop in the
camp with your sister.

55:32.600 --> 55:34.001
I will let her know.

55:45.178 --> 55:47.013
There must be no
sign of them here.

55:47.047 --> 55:48.448
What have you done?

55:49.683 --> 55:51.448
What any decent man would do.

55:52.417 --> 55:53.753
Since when were you decent?

56:00.926 --> 56:01.761
Gudrun!

56:04.195 --> 56:05.196
I found the priest.

56:07.632 --> 56:08.967
Lord be praised.

56:09.033 --> 56:10.933
The Lord had
nothing to do with it.

56:10.935 --> 56:11.736
I sent him with your sister.

56:11.770 --> 56:13.269
They're going north.

56:13.271 --> 56:15.370
When Odinsson finds out
the priest is missing,

56:15.372 --> 56:16.707
he will surely come here.

56:18.942 --> 56:19.977
What have you done?

56:20.944 --> 56:21.779
A good deed.

56:25.883 --> 56:26.816
But at what cost?

56:59.914 --> 57:00.781
Odinsson!

57:21.834 --> 57:24.336
Where's the earl?

57:29.006 --> 57:30.141
Find out.

57:30.174 --> 57:31.876
Stranger, good you're here.

57:32.977 --> 57:34.979
Are you back already?

57:35.012 --> 57:36.712
There's been a
terrible slaughter.

57:36.714 --> 57:38.149
What happened here?

57:39.649 --> 57:40.483
A raiding party?

57:41.852 --> 57:43.787
How many men are dead?

57:43.820 --> 57:46.320
Three, and the priest is gone.

57:46.322 --> 57:48.222
How did Gudrun find out

57:48.224 --> 57:49.292
- that the priest was here?
- Where is Tor

57:49.325 --> 57:51.491
and the rest of our men?

57:51.493 --> 57:52.361
They rode ahead.

57:54.529 --> 57:56.329
What do you mean by that?

57:56.331 --> 57:57.731
Did we rout the king's men?

57:57.733 --> 57:59.334
Wife, quiet.

57:59.368 --> 58:02.202
Do not be ashamed
to rout with the weak.

58:02.204 --> 58:03.171
They sailed back.

58:04.372 --> 58:06.140
The king's men sailed back.

58:06.174 --> 58:08.642
But I saw the ships burn.

58:09.811 --> 58:12.313
I saw the glow from
the tower myself.

58:13.681 --> 58:15.749
Tell me, stranger,
what is happening here?

58:19.352 --> 58:20.819
Seize him!

58:35.567 --> 58:37.269
So, where were you?

58:39.404 --> 58:41.406
Was it you who
killed our guards?!

59:00.557 --> 59:04.258
Where is the priest?!

59:05.895 --> 59:06.729
Enough!

59:12.936 --> 59:13.769
Leave him.

59:17.439 --> 59:19.441
He's not gonna talk right now.

59:21.877 --> 59:25.413
Let him think about his answers.

59:27.114 --> 59:28.615
He will talk eventually.

59:29.716 --> 59:32.653
He is nothing more

59:34.255 --> 59:35.756
than a cowardly bastard,

59:37.291 --> 59:40.491
sneaking around like
the trickster himself.

59:40.493 --> 59:41.327
Look at this.

59:45.765 --> 59:49.002
Don't honor him by comparing
him to one of the gods.

59:51.603 --> 59:52.637
Take it to the earl.

01:00:05.449 --> 01:00:09.287
Think well, Stranger, or you
will have a painful death.

01:00:19.997 --> 01:00:20.830
My lord.

01:00:22.299 --> 01:00:26.800
We retrieved this ring from
the hand of the stranger.

01:00:26.802 --> 01:00:29.438
Combs, raven insignia.

01:00:31.473 --> 01:00:35.311
How did a mercenary end up
with something this precious?

01:00:36.879 --> 01:00:38.947
Deceit and murder, no doubt.

01:00:53.493 --> 01:00:55.963
It's made for me.

01:00:59.199 --> 01:01:00.000
Thank you.

01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:02.501
Okay. Go.

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:04.145
He must talk now.

01:03:15.257 --> 01:03:18.193
He is here, somewhere
in this village.

01:03:19.594 --> 01:03:23.596
And if you find out that someone
is hiding him, kill them!

01:03:30.137 --> 01:03:32.973
Stranger, I know you're here.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.633
Stranger!

01:04:22.752 --> 01:04:24.654
Come out, you little rat.

01:04:30.559 --> 01:04:31.760
You.

01:04:31.827 --> 01:04:33.362
Get in here, quick.

01:04:46.241 --> 01:04:49.242
I haven't seen
him, yes, I swear!

01:04:49.244 --> 01:04:50.242
You're lying!

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:58.683
The man who lives by the sword
does not leave gold behind!

01:04:58.685 --> 01:05:00.187
I'm a trader!

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:02.419
Many strangers pass
through those doors.

01:05:02.421 --> 01:05:04.421
Many strangers pay for lodging!

01:05:04.423 --> 01:05:06.692
Yeah, and how many strangers

01:05:06.725 --> 01:05:09.193
have been coming through
those doors lately?

01:05:09.195 --> 01:05:11.063
I don't take sides!

01:05:11.096 --> 01:05:13.764
I will feed and sell
to anyone who pays,

01:05:13.766 --> 01:05:15.765
who prays to any god.

01:05:15.767 --> 01:05:18.401
It's all your killing
that hurts my business!

01:05:20.238 --> 01:05:24.240
You listen here, if you
see your little friend again,

01:05:24.242 --> 01:05:26.808
or I find out that
you've been hiding him,

01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:29.713
I swear by the gods,
I will skin you alive!

01:05:40.956 --> 01:05:42.057
Little rat.

01:05:59.641 --> 01:06:01.408
Blacksmith.

01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:02.976
Have you seen the stranger?

01:06:04.912 --> 01:06:05.679
The stranger?

01:06:07.147 --> 01:06:09.317
I haven't seen him since he
came by to look at a sword.

01:06:11.185 --> 01:06:14.086
You mean this sword.

01:06:17.524 --> 01:06:18.791
She was stolen from me.

01:06:21.661 --> 01:06:23.330
It's nice to see her again.

01:06:33.171 --> 01:06:35.274
You can keep the sword.

01:06:36.208 --> 01:06:38.175
And if the stranger turns up,

01:06:40.845 --> 01:06:41.779
come and find me.

01:06:43.848 --> 01:06:46.016
Of
course, Tor, I will.

01:07:02.030 --> 01:07:05.368
We must still maintain
a certain order here.

01:07:05.401 --> 01:07:07.901
We're starting the war because
of a stranger's action can...

01:07:07.903 --> 01:07:11.674
He cannot have acted alone
and killed all our men.

01:07:11.707 --> 01:07:14.340
They were clearly
not as good as...

01:07:14.342 --> 01:07:17.011
Why did he take the priest?

01:07:17.044 --> 01:07:18.678
What did he do with him?

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.714
Think about it!

01:07:20.882 --> 01:07:23.017
He must have had help
from the Christians.

01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:26.551
Why would he go through the
trouble of freeing a priest?!

01:07:26.553 --> 01:07:28.221
Olav, good, you're here.

01:07:28.255 --> 01:07:29.823
Did you find him?

01:07:29.856 --> 01:07:30.691
No, my lord.

01:07:33.894 --> 01:07:35.727
I think you're right.

01:07:35.729 --> 01:07:38.562
He must have had help
from the Christians.

01:07:38.564 --> 01:07:40.230
Yes, my lord.

01:07:40.232 --> 01:07:43.734
It's about time that we
rout these Christians

01:07:43.736 --> 01:07:44.568
out of this town.

01:07:44.570 --> 01:07:45.405
Hear, hear!

01:07:47.006 --> 01:07:48.541
Gather the men.

01:07:48.574 --> 01:07:50.440
We do this now.

01:07:50.442 --> 01:07:52.611
It's already done, my lord.

01:07:52.677 --> 01:07:53.512
Let's go.

01:08:19.935 --> 01:08:21.371
I'll
get you somewhere safe.

01:08:26.375 --> 01:08:27.541
Heavenly Father
give us strength

01:08:27.542 --> 01:08:29.376
in our faith to
overcome the heathens.

01:08:47.995 --> 01:08:50.328
Your god has abandoned us.

01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:51.163
My god?

01:08:52.332 --> 01:08:54.067
It is the only god.

01:08:55.167 --> 01:08:57.134
Have you lost your faith?

01:08:57.136 --> 01:08:59.738
Why should one god
be better than many,

01:08:59.773 --> 01:09:01.939
when clearly he is not?

01:09:01.974 --> 01:09:05.975
Gudrun, you traded your
spirit for falsehoods.

01:09:05.978 --> 01:09:07.412
When Odinsson
killed your husband,

01:09:07.446 --> 01:09:09.979
he was only trying
to protect you.

01:09:09.982 --> 01:09:11.750
What are you saying?

01:09:11.783 --> 01:09:13.618
How could you be so heartless?

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.287
Where is your godliness?

01:09:18.923 --> 01:09:20.157
You made me choose,

01:09:22.026 --> 01:09:24.595
between my love of the
gods and my love for you.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:30.533
You must see now that you
chose to follow the wrong god.

01:09:32.603 --> 01:09:33.837
He is brought us nothing

01:09:35.138 --> 01:09:39.108
but fear, loss, and sadness.

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:41.877
What of our sister?

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:45.848
She's safe now, with the priest.

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:46.782
Where is Freya?

01:09:47.883 --> 01:09:48.718
Escaped?

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:52.487
The stranger.

01:09:55.156 --> 01:09:59.160
He may have saved Freya, but
he doomed the rest of us.

01:09:59.193 --> 01:10:01.193
He was sent by God!

01:10:01.195 --> 01:10:02.730
He was sent by Loki!

01:10:05.499 --> 01:10:06.734
We have to let them know.

01:10:09.036 --> 01:10:10.536
You have to give
Freya and the priest time

01:10:10.538 --> 01:10:12.540
to get further away.

01:10:12.573 --> 01:10:14.574
We should sacrifice
ourselves for them?

01:10:16.008 --> 01:10:17.677
She has always
been your weakness.

01:10:45.603 --> 01:10:47.705
The faith must survive.

01:10:52.008 --> 01:10:52.942
Where is he?

01:10:54.077 --> 01:10:56.110
You said he would be here.

01:10:56.112 --> 01:10:58.780
No doubt he has run
off like a coward.

01:10:58.782 --> 01:11:00.249
He couldn't even move.

01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:02.785
Maybe it was a trick.

01:11:06.054 --> 01:11:07.790
He couldn't
have gone far.

01:11:09.525 --> 01:11:10.526
Let's find him!

01:11:16.764 --> 01:11:18.063
Heavenly
Father give us strength

01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:20.065
in our faith to
overcome the heathens.

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:21.233
Heavenly Father give us strength

01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:22.568
in our faith to
overcome the heathens.

01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:23.805
Bishop!

01:11:28.274 --> 01:11:29.941
Where are you hiding him?!

01:11:29.943 --> 01:11:31.311
Heavenly Father
give us strength in our faith

01:11:31.377 --> 01:11:33.880
- to overcome the heathens.
- Gudrun!

01:11:33.914 --> 01:11:35.146
Are you in there?!

01:11:35.148 --> 01:11:37.383
Heavenly Father give us faith.

01:11:37.417 --> 01:11:39.650
Heavenly Father give us faith.

01:11:39.652 --> 01:11:42.588
- Heavenly Father give us...
- Bishop!

01:11:42.622 --> 01:11:47.627
Send him out, or I burn
your church to the ground!

01:11:56.935 --> 01:11:57.736
Cowards!

01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:04.474
Turn and face us!

01:12:36.137 --> 01:12:37.005
Run! Run!

01:12:38.673 --> 01:12:39.640
Get him!

01:12:47.147 --> 01:12:49.216
What are you waiting for?

01:13:14.038 --> 01:13:15.907
Where's your god now, witch?!

01:14:07.387 --> 01:14:08.521
I know this place.

01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:13.293
You will be safe
here until you recover.

01:14:20.132 --> 01:14:22.633
Agnir will bring
you food and water.

01:14:22.635 --> 01:14:23.535
She will heal you.

01:14:24.904 --> 01:14:25.737
Rest.

01:15:44.043 --> 01:15:45.878
Drink, drink.

01:16:33.588 --> 01:16:36.324
Drink, drink.

01:16:36.357 --> 01:16:37.192
Drink.

01:17:22.099 --> 01:17:24.068
My lord, what have I done?

01:17:26.236 --> 01:17:28.438
You lied to my face, Agnir.

01:17:29.639 --> 01:17:32.542
You have betrayed the earl.

01:17:32.575 --> 01:17:34.410
You will have to be punished.

01:17:34.444 --> 01:17:36.913
No, no, no, I've done nothing.

01:17:40.749 --> 01:17:45.554
Agnir, you can save
yourself from a painful death.

01:17:48.657 --> 01:17:51.059
I don't like to do this,

01:17:51.092 --> 01:17:53.225
but we must bring the stranger

01:17:53.227 --> 01:17:55.461
to pay for what
he has done here.

01:17:55.463 --> 01:17:57.565
So tell me where he is,

01:17:57.598 --> 01:17:59.631
then all of this will be over.

01:18:02.569 --> 01:18:06.473
Olav, cut his flesh,
and make him talk.

01:18:22.989 --> 01:18:24.288
Blacksmith.

01:18:26.324 --> 01:18:28.493
They found out that
Agnir was helping you.

01:18:29.694 --> 01:18:31.963
They have him tied up
at the village square.

01:18:31.997 --> 01:18:33.164
And they took your gold.

01:18:37.467 --> 01:18:39.301
That is unfortunate.

01:18:39.303 --> 01:18:41.269
I thought you might need this.

01:18:41.271 --> 01:18:46.276
Ah,
Grim, I missed you.

01:19:26.379 --> 01:19:29.182
You've been a busy
little man, Blacksmith.

01:19:30.483 --> 01:19:33.084
The life of a
blacksmith is always busy.

01:19:33.086 --> 01:19:35.086
Where have you been?

01:19:40.559 --> 01:19:44.227
Delivering axes.

01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:45.064
To who?

01:19:49.068 --> 01:19:52.903
There's nobody down there in
that part of town, Blacksmith.

01:20:03.246 --> 01:20:08.251
Do you want to be hanging
there next to your friend?

01:20:22.031 --> 01:20:25.300
You've been delivering
weapons to ghosts.

01:20:32.573 --> 01:20:34.909
Don't take the earl for a fool.

01:20:36.711 --> 01:20:39.477
Where is the stranger?

01:21:03.101 --> 01:21:03.668
Stranger.

01:21:05.137 --> 01:21:06.638
You work for the earl.

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:08.940
Remember?

01:21:10.975 --> 01:21:13.575
That's where you're wrong.

01:21:24.421 --> 01:21:25.821
You are a fool.

01:21:34.630 --> 01:21:36.632
Just give up, Stranger.

01:21:50.878 --> 01:21:51.779
Blacksmith!

01:21:53.814 --> 01:21:56.382
I will have your
head on a spike!

01:21:56.384 --> 01:21:57.185
You snake.

01:22:00.188 --> 01:22:03.990
You wouldn't kill an
unarmed man, would you?

01:22:55.571 --> 01:22:57.406
Odinsson!

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:11.052
A lot of death has been
seen through these eyes.

01:23:35.708 --> 01:23:36.809
Let's make a deal.

01:23:38.710 --> 01:23:40.312
I have silver, gold.

01:23:42.281 --> 01:23:43.114
I have lands.

01:23:44.483 --> 01:23:45.750
I will grant you a homestead.

01:23:45.784 --> 01:23:48.117
You have something
that belongs to me.

01:23:48.119 --> 01:23:49.451
Yes.

01:23:49.453 --> 01:23:51.255
I'll give you
everything you want.

01:23:52.756 --> 01:23:55.824
Why is it that when
cowards face certain death,

01:23:55.826 --> 01:23:58.296
they grovel and become
less than a knave?

01:24:04.167 --> 01:24:06.836
You will not be
going to Valhalla,

01:24:06.903 --> 01:24:09.572
and you will not be feasting
with Odin any time soon.

01:24:10.773 --> 01:24:13.475
This is for my
father you killed!

01:25:06.324 --> 01:25:09.060
I may have overstayed
my welcome.

01:25:11.229 --> 01:25:12.464
The town is yours.

01:25:13.497 --> 01:25:14.731
Belongs to no god.

01:25:17.701 --> 01:25:18.869
Thank you, my prince.

01:25:20.404 --> 01:25:22.904
I knew it.

01:25:22.906 --> 01:25:25.841
I knew you weren't
just a stranger.

01:25:56.672 --> 01:26:01.672
