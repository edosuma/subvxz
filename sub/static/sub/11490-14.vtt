WEBVTT

00:04.358 --> 00:06.197
Would you like the last sausage?

00:06.226 --> 00:08.594
- Oh, how about we split it?
- Okay.

00:08.604 --> 00:10.652
Meet you in the middle.

00:12.840 --> 00:15.427
Okay. Sexy.

00:22.929 --> 00:26.166
Nothing says love like
a little morning pork.

00:29.762 --> 00:32.070
You're home early. How was Vegas?

00:32.789 --> 00:34.287
Never again.

00:34.307 --> 00:35.516
Oh, you lost?

00:35.536 --> 00:40.351
No, Alan. I won so much freaking
money that I'm embarrassed to go back.

00:41.929 --> 00:45.376
All right... well, uh,
you remember Melissa?

00:45.386 --> 00:47.034
Of course he remembers me, Alan.

00:47.054 --> 00:49.731
He deflowered me, then dumped me.

00:51.180 --> 00:56.554
No offense, sweetheart, but your flower had
been plucked and potted long before I met you.

00:57.183 --> 01:00.340
Okay, okay, look. Look,
we're all adults here.

01:00.350 --> 01:03.796
This doesn't have to be awkward,
you know. I mean, sure...

01:04.146 --> 01:10.140
Melissa is my receptionist, and sure, she was
with you, and sure, that ended badly, but, uh ...

01:13.386 --> 01:16.223
Okay, I guess this
does have to be awkward.

01:16.233 --> 01:17.892
Honey, shouldn't we be
getting ready for work?

01:17.902 --> 01:19.330
Yes, yes, let's do that.

01:19.360 --> 01:20.289
You want to shower together?

01:20.319 --> 01:23.266
Oh, great, great. Uh, let me
just, uh, start without you.

01:23.276 --> 01:25.993
There's a couple of
things I'd like to prewash.

01:26.972 --> 01:29.939
There's a mental image I didn't need.

01:30.519 --> 01:32.946
Charlie, I need to talk to you.

01:32.966 --> 01:34.794
I'm sorry I was a jerk.

01:34.844 --> 01:40.578
I'm happy for you and Alan, and I will kick myself for
the rest of my life for losing someone as special as you.

01:40.608 --> 01:42.526
No, silly, it's about something else.

01:42.556 --> 01:45.763
Oh, good, 'cause even
I didn't believe that.

01:46.792 --> 01:50.088
Alan's birthday is next Saturday.

01:50.108 --> 01:52.386
Really? I don't think so.

01:52.396 --> 01:54.503
Yeppers. He's gonna be 40.

01:54.513 --> 01:56.841
Wow, that is so weird.

01:56.871 --> 01:59.179
My baby brother's gonna be 40.

01:59.199 --> 02:01.586
- How old are you?
- 39

02:03.284 --> 02:05.462
That's what makes it so weird.

02:06.041 --> 02:09.877
Anyway, I think we should
have a party for him.

02:09.887 --> 02:11.676
Why?

02:11.706 --> 02:17.729
Because it's an important birthday, and he deserves
a big party with all his friends and loved ones.

02:17.739 --> 02:20.836
All right... all right,
let's break this down.

02:20.846 --> 02:22.474
You want him to get what he deserves.

02:22.504 --> 02:25.551
You want it to be with his friends and
loved ones, and you want it to be big.

02:25.561 --> 02:27.759
Pick one.

02:28.028 --> 02:29.966
Come on, Charlie.
Don't be such a pooper.

02:29.976 --> 02:32.664
If it's gonna be a fun
party, I need your help.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.351
You want it to be
fun? Don't invite Alan.

02:35.361 --> 02:36.430
- Charlie...
- Okay.

02:36.440 --> 02:40.136
Okay, you know who would love to
help you out with this? Our mom.

02:40.146 --> 02:40.855
Really?

02:40.885 --> 02:45.241
Oh, yeah. Nothing she likes better
than extending herself for other people.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.988
Good idea. I'll give her a call.

02:47.998 --> 02:50.085
You do that.

02:50.115 --> 02:53.142
Wait till she hears Alan's 40.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.074

03:27.906 --> 03:29.994
Charlie.

03:30.014 --> 03:31.742
Wake up. I need to talk to you.

03:31.752 --> 03:34.599
Don't move. Don't blink.

03:35.528 --> 03:37.686
Maybe she'll think
you're dead and leave.

03:37.696 --> 03:39.274
I know you can hear me, Charlie.

03:39.284 --> 03:43.490
She's bluffing. Just stay still.

03:46.806 --> 03:48.425
Okay, don't panic.

03:48.455 --> 03:52.301
You've experienced
oxygen deprivation before.

03:52.311 --> 03:54.908
I can't breathe, Mom.

03:54.918 --> 03:58.374
Oh, good, you're awake.

03:58.384 --> 03:59.973
What can I do for you?

04:00.002 --> 04:03.759
I received a very unsettling
message on my answering machine,

04:03.779 --> 04:06.436
and I would like you
to explain it to me.

04:06.456 --> 04:08.054
Okay, look.

04:08.064 --> 04:11.670
Sometimes the liquor makes
me say hateful things.

04:11.680 --> 04:15.836
No, this message was from
some woman named Melissa.

04:15.866 --> 04:17.923
Alan's receptionist.

04:17.954 --> 04:19.752
Really?From the sound of her voice,

04:19.762 --> 04:23.718
I'd guess she earns her living
baking cookies in a hollow tree.

04:24.986 --> 04:30.361
Anyway, she's somehow gotten it into her
head that Alan is turning 40 on Saturday.

04:30.391 --> 04:31.679
Yeah, so?

04:31.709 --> 04:33.118
Is she insane?

04:33.148 --> 04:36.315
Running around telling
people my son is 40?

04:36.345 --> 04:39.271
I know. She's a bad person.

04:40.350 --> 04:44.796
That's not all. She wants
me to help with a party.

04:44.806 --> 04:49.351
Where in God's name could
she have gotten such an idea?

04:50.460 --> 04:52.797
Beats me.

04:53.187 --> 04:57.293
Maybe the fact that you're his
mother confused the poor girl.

05:04.195 --> 05:05.804
Oh, you're up.

05:05.844 --> 05:08.221
You've been cleaning in
there this whole time?

05:08.851 --> 05:11.458
Sure, let's say I was cleaning.

05:12.157 --> 05:15.094
Hey, Uncle Charlie, if you're going out
today, can I pull your car out of the garage?

05:15.134 --> 05:17.631
No, I don't want you pulling
my car out of the garage.

05:17.661 --> 05:20.738
Okay, I won't. From now on.

05:22.436 --> 05:24.764
Hey, what's, uh...
what's going on up here?

05:24.774 --> 05:26.362
Oh, terrific.

05:26.402 --> 05:30.268
This meeting of the worst club in the
history of the world can now come to order.

05:30.298 --> 05:32.876
Madam President, you have the floor.

05:33.385 --> 05:36.172
Oh, I get it. Sorry to interrupt.

05:36.182 --> 05:39.658
Go back to what you were planning...
uh, uh doing, uh, whatever.

05:40.977 --> 05:45.612
Oh, uh, apropos of nothing, uh, I like
red velvet cake and close-up magic.

05:49.189 --> 05:52.645
Oh, crap. Now we have
to throw him a party.

05:52.655 --> 05:55.052
- Who?
- Your father.

05:55.062 --> 05:58.029
- Why?
- It's his birthday.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.636
Can I bring a date?

06:01.955 --> 06:04.083
- You got a date?
- That depends.

06:04.093 --> 06:06.850
- On what?
- Can I borrow your car?

06:08.139 --> 06:10.636
You don't got a date.

06:13.173 --> 06:16.960
You know, we don't have to go out to
dinner just 'cause it's my birthday.

06:16.980 --> 06:19.876
Don't be silly. This
is a very special night.

06:19.886 --> 06:21.894
How many times do you turn 40?

06:21.914 --> 06:24.332
In my family, three or four.

06:24.841 --> 06:28.148
Well, the first time
is the one that counts.

06:28.158 --> 06:31.534
Okay So... so, it's just us, right?

06:31.984 --> 06:34.921
Of course, it's just
us. Who else would it be?

06:34.931 --> 06:38.097
I don't know. My friends, family.

06:38.737 --> 06:41.394
A close-up magician.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.251
Oh, darn, what gave it away?

06:44.281 --> 06:47.747
Well, when I left the house, Jake was taking
a shower, uh, Charlie had on long pants,

06:47.777 --> 06:51.753
and Berta said she had to quit early because
she was going to some loser's birthday party.

06:52.472 --> 06:54.930
Oh, good, I had her down as a "maybe."

06:55.559 --> 06:58.167
Promise you'll act surprised.

07:02.802 --> 07:06.228
Oh, my God, what a surprise!

07:11.493 --> 07:14.000
I don't know these people.

07:14.010 --> 07:16.507
We have a private room.

07:17.307 --> 07:19.374
Sorry.

07:19.954 --> 07:22.511
We got a private room.

07:22.531 --> 07:24.149
Go back to your dinner.

07:24.159 --> 07:26.167
Ooh, gazpacho.

07:28.755 --> 07:30.073
This is so nice.

07:30.093 --> 07:32.511
A private, intimate dinner
for just the two of us.

07:32.551 --> 07:35.607
Oh, my God, you guys!

07:40.972 --> 07:42.650
There's nobody here.

07:42.670 --> 07:45.787
I don't understand it. I told
them to be here an hour ago.

07:45.797 --> 07:47.755
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?

07:47.805 --> 07:51.721
My family are a bunch of
thoughtless, selfish butt-wipes.

07:54.698 --> 07:57.035
Surprise.

08:01.211 --> 08:03.638
Evelyn, smile.

08:04.877 --> 08:06.865
That's a keeper.

08:06.895 --> 08:09.292
Listen, darling, are you going
to be cutting the cake soon?

08:09.322 --> 08:12.259
Because, actually, I have
a real party to go to.

08:12.289 --> 08:14.517
You can't go. We haven't
even done the speeches yet.

08:14.527 --> 08:17.004
Oh, of course.

08:17.674 --> 08:19.891
Were we supposed to write speeches?

08:19.911 --> 08:20.880
For what?

08:20.920 --> 08:22.528
For Alan.

08:22.548 --> 08:24.766
Let him write his own speech.

08:25.895 --> 08:28.252
Uh, can I have your attention, please?

08:28.292 --> 08:31.879
I want to thank you all for coming
to celebrate this wonderful occasion.

08:31.919 --> 08:34.535
I thought it was Alan's birthday.

08:36.854 --> 08:40.510
And now it's time to say a few
words about the guest of honor.

08:40.539 --> 08:43.397
I can think of a few words.

08:43.796 --> 08:47.992
Not only is he a terrific
doctor and fantastic boss,

08:48.052 --> 08:52.307
he is also good and kind
and smart and funny...

08:52.317 --> 08:56.133
and... a really swell kisser.

08:56.463 --> 08:58.611
I can still hear you.

08:58.641 --> 09:03.845
Sorry I'm late. I was burning a fatty
with one of the busboys in the parking lot.

09:03.855 --> 09:06.183
How are you?

09:06.193 --> 09:08.201
Everyone, this is my mother, Shelly.

09:08.221 --> 09:10.249
Mom, this is Alan's
mother, Evelyn, and...

09:10.289 --> 09:15.423
Sweetie, save your breath, because I'm
way too toasted to remember a lot of names.

09:16.172 --> 09:18.440
Ooh, bread.

09:23.874 --> 09:26.162
All right, well, uh,
now that we're all here,

09:26.212 --> 09:31.736
why don't we take turns saying something
about Alan and how much he means to us.

09:32.116 --> 09:34.074
Okay, Jake, you want to start?

09:34.104 --> 09:36.811
No, I got to go make room for cake.

09:37.061 --> 09:41.786
Uh, Berta, why don't
you get the ball rolling?

09:42.025 --> 09:44.753
Sure. What the hell?

09:46.351 --> 09:51.885
Zippy, I got to tell you, when you first
moved in, I didn't really care for you.

09:52.704 --> 09:56.940
You were a persnickety,
self-righteous, smug son of a bitch.

09:57.669 --> 10:01.245
And now here we are, six years later.

10:02.085 --> 10:04.852
Thank you.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.007
Hear, hear.

10:09.017 --> 10:11.265
Oh, okay. Anyone else?

10:11.275 --> 10:13.223
Okay. I'll go.

10:16.539 --> 10:21.165
I have pictures of myself dressed
in a forest ranger uniform,

10:21.205 --> 10:26.119
and I have absolutely no memory
of ever working as a forest ranger.

10:26.549 --> 10:28.597
Thank you.

10:32.213 --> 10:34.621
All righty.

10:34.631 --> 10:37.937
Uh, who's next? Evelyn?

10:37.947 --> 10:41.404
Me? Isn't it enough I carried
him for seven and a half months?

10:41.414 --> 10:44.570
You'd be surprised how many
women opt for the full nine.

10:45.469 --> 10:47.327
Come on, Evelyn, you
have to say something.

10:47.367 --> 10:49.385
Oh, fine.

10:50.144 --> 10:52.142
Alan, darling.

10:52.162 --> 10:54.810
You were always the good son.

10:55.609 --> 10:58.845
Of course, your brother
didn't set the bar very high.

10:59.155 --> 11:01.343
- Hear, hear.
- Wait a minute.

11:02.941 --> 11:05.079
Charlie, do you want to say anything?

11:05.668 --> 11:08.136
Uh, all right.

11:10.044 --> 11:13.270
Alan, you're my little brother.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.788
And I know over the
years I've tormented you.

11:15.808 --> 11:17.826
I've embarrassed you in public.

11:17.855 --> 11:23.020
I've tied you to streetlights, car
bumpers, the occasional angry animal...

11:24.668 --> 11:29.284
Oh, remember that Fourth of July when I used
your ass as a launch pad for my bottle rockets?

11:30.292 --> 11:33.899
Anyway, I guess what
I'm trying to say is...

11:33.909 --> 11:36.476
thanks for the memories.

11:39.793 --> 11:43.369
That's it? That's all you have to say?

11:43.379 --> 11:46.276
I suppose I could talk
about his bed-wetting.

11:49.033 --> 11:50.402
You people are horrible.

11:50.411 --> 11:51.390
No. Honey, it's okay.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.438
No-no-no-no,
it's not okay.

11:53.468 --> 11:55.246
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

11:55.276 --> 12:00.381
This is a warm and wonderful human being and
he deserves more, especially from his family.

12:00.431 --> 12:02.529
I don't even know why you
guys showed up tonight.

12:02.559 --> 12:06.175
Well, I can't speak for anybody
else, but I'm getting overtime.

12:08.193 --> 12:09.532
Come on, Alan. We're leaving.

12:09.542 --> 12:11.060
Really? Before the cake?

12:11.070 --> 12:13.118
You don't need people
who don't appreciate you.

12:13.128 --> 12:16.374
Uh, well, no, but I do kind
of need Charlie's house.

12:16.804 --> 12:20.031
No, you don't. You'll come live
with me and Mom. Right, Mom?

12:20.041 --> 12:23.837
You know, I did spend a summer
in Yosemite doing shrooms,

12:23.867 --> 12:27.513
so maybe I wasn't an
official forest ranger.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.500
Let's go. Mom, we're leaving.

12:30.510 --> 12:35.225
Okay. I'm sorry. This is
the best bread I ever had.

12:40.609 --> 12:43.436
Who likes magic?

12:45.774 --> 12:48.331
I shaved for this?

13:11.667 --> 13:13.954
- Berta?
- Who's asking?

13:15.263 --> 13:16.382
What's wrong?

13:16.412 --> 13:19.119
Too much celebrating last night.

13:19.129 --> 13:21.307
I didn't notice you
drinking at Alan's party.

13:21.337 --> 13:23.384
No, afterward.

13:23.404 --> 13:26.002
With the magician at his place.

13:27.810 --> 13:29.348
You went back to his place?

13:29.378 --> 13:31.936
Well, technically, his van.

13:33.454 --> 13:35.042
Well, why didn't you just stay home?

13:35.072 --> 13:37.729
If I stay home, you don't pay me.

13:38.659 --> 13:41.815
So you just came in to lie on my couch?

13:41.845 --> 13:44.123
Tough times, Charlie.

13:44.143 --> 13:46.910
Some people are living in their vans.

13:49.108 --> 13:51.685
Oh, make it stop!

13:55.811 --> 13:57.838
Hello?

13:57.848 --> 13:59.597
Hi, Mom.

13:59.607 --> 14:01.974
Alan? Nah, he didn't come home.

14:02.903 --> 14:06.939
You're right. We were
funny. He just overreacted.

14:08.238 --> 14:12.383
I'm sure he'll come back
eventually. He always does.

14:12.763 --> 14:15.430
You should've named him "Herpes."

14:20.715 --> 14:23.701
Yeah, I wish I'd thought
of it last night, too.

14:25.689 --> 14:28.347
Talk to you later.

14:28.357 --> 14:30.984
So what are we going to do today?

14:30.994 --> 14:32.612
Aren't you going to ask about your dad?

14:32.632 --> 14:34.780
What about him?

14:34.790 --> 14:37.827
Were we not at the
same party last night?

14:37.857 --> 14:42.182
Did you not notice when you finally came
out of the toilet that your father was gone?

14:43.151 --> 14:45.978
You know, now at you mention it...

14:48.276 --> 14:50.474
Herpes, Jr.

14:58.225 --> 14:59.814
Look who's back.

14:59.854 --> 15:02.261
I'm not back I just
came to get my stuff.

15:02.281 --> 15:03.959
You're really going to
milk this thing, huh?

15:03.989 --> 15:06.257
I'm not milking anything,
Chlie. There is no milk.

15:06.267 --> 15:08.335
I'm moving in with
Melissa and her mother.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.892
Sounds like milk to me.

15:11.811 --> 15:16.486
I need to be someplace where I'm appreciated,
someplace where I'm nurtured and loved.

15:23.349 --> 15:25.387
You're not taking me seriously, are you?

15:25.417 --> 15:27.025
Oh, come on, Alan.

15:27.055 --> 15:28.344
You ain't going anywhere.

15:28.374 --> 15:29.673
You know it. I know it.

15:29.683 --> 15:32.709
The seagulls out there
crapping on my deck know it.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.155
You think he'll be back?

15:39.482 --> 15:41.810
Oh, yeah.

15:45.546 --> 15:47.974
No, no. This is it.

15:47.984 --> 15:50.671
This is where I cut the cord!

15:52.659 --> 15:54.347
Oh, man.

15:54.367 --> 15:57.813
I think David Copperfield
slipped me a roofie.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.198
I really appreciate you
taking me in like this.

16:03.228 --> 16:06.145
Yeah, we love you,
Alan. We want you here.

16:06.155 --> 16:09.921
You're a good man, and
you have a beautiful soul.

16:09.931 --> 16:12.198
It is beautiful, isn't it?

16:12.218 --> 16:13.787
God forbid my family should notice.

16:13.797 --> 16:15.834
- Oh, damn, I knew I'd forget something!
- What'd you forget?

16:15.844 --> 16:17.862
My son.

16:19.301 --> 16:21.079
Well, that's no problem.

16:21.119 --> 16:25.534
We'll just move Mom's hydroponic equipment
out of the garage and make a bedroom for him.

16:25.544 --> 16:26.673
Hydroponic equipment?

16:26.703 --> 16:29.141
I'm a bit of a horticulturist.

16:29.171 --> 16:31.478
A little herb garden.

16:31.878 --> 16:36.263
Ah, okay. Well, uh, uh, just a
heads-up, I love my son and everything,

16:36.273 --> 16:39.460
but he hasn't quite gotten
to "beautiful soul" yet.

16:39.490 --> 16:41.767
He's more "methane cloud."

16:41.777 --> 16:43.795
He's still one of God's flowers.

16:43.815 --> 16:47.222
All he needs is a little love,
ultraviolet light, potassium

16:47.232 --> 16:50.328
and he'll grow into
some righteous chronic.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.671
Quitting time.

17:20.146 --> 17:21.256
What are you doing here?

17:21.276 --> 17:23.364
I'm watching TV.

17:23.374 --> 17:25.981
- Why didn't you go with your dad?
- Dad was here?

17:27.440 --> 17:31.505
Yeah, he came by to get his stuff
and I figured that included you.

17:31.515 --> 17:34.313
I'm not stuff, Uncle
Charlie. I'm a human being.

17:34.323 --> 17:36.600
Don't flatter yourself.

17:38.628 --> 17:40.806
And turn off the TV. I'm
taking you back to your mom's.

17:40.816 --> 17:42.674
Mom and Herb are in Mexico.

17:42.694 --> 17:43.633
For how long?

17:43.663 --> 17:45.990
I don't know.

17:46.610 --> 17:49.597
Turn off the TV. I'm
taking you to Mexico.

17:50.096 --> 17:52.354
Can I drive?

17:55.890 --> 17:58.128
You all comfy, cozy?

17:59.276 --> 18:00.855
Mom made you some hot chocolate.

18:00.875 --> 18:02.353
Oh, thank you.

18:02.363 --> 18:05.710
Oh, and it's got those little
marshmallows. I love those.

18:05.720 --> 18:09.106
Good. I'm going to the market.
What would you like for dinner?

18:09.116 --> 18:11.604
Oh, gosh, I don't
know. What do you want?

18:12.003 --> 18:15.010
I want to please you.

18:17.637 --> 18:19.915
Really?

18:19.945 --> 18:22.592
No one's ever said that to me before.

18:23.661 --> 18:25.979
Get used to it.

18:25.989 --> 18:28.086
I'll try.

18:28.096 --> 18:29.964
Now, what can I get you?

18:29.994 --> 18:31.663
Um, well...

18:31.683 --> 18:34.110
you know the macaroni that's
shaped like the little wagon wheels?

18:34.140 --> 18:35.259
I do.

18:35.279 --> 18:37.836
I like that with melted cheese.

18:37.846 --> 18:39.784
You got it.

18:41.293 --> 18:43.970
Oh, and maybe a couple of
those bottled wine spritzers?

18:43.990 --> 18:46.078
Okeydoke.

18:49.424 --> 18:54.449
I'm getting mac and spritzers
I'm getting mac anspritzers.

18:55.837 --> 18:58.824
Here you go, bright eyes. I
made you some banana bread.

18:58.834 --> 19:02.760
Aw, really? Banana bread? Oh, thank you.

19:04.149 --> 19:06.067
Wow, it's still warm.

19:06.097 --> 19:07.865
Mmm, right out of the oven.

19:07.895 --> 19:10.312
Oh, that's, uh, that's very unusual.

19:10.332 --> 19:13.519
Uh, I'm tasting bananas and,
uh, what is that, nutmeg?

19:13.539 --> 19:15.647
Nope.

19:16.546 --> 19:17.465
Mmm, that's good.

19:17.485 --> 19:21.201
You know what? You might want
to just start with half a piece.

19:28.533 --> 19:30.751
I can't believe it.

19:30.771 --> 19:32.949
Believe what?

19:32.959 --> 19:34.597
I think I miss him.

19:34.627 --> 19:36.745
Miss who?

19:39.182 --> 19:41.200
Your father.

19:42.529 --> 19:43.937
What about you?

19:43.957 --> 19:46.225
What about me what?

19:47.364 --> 19:49.651
- Do you miss him?
- Who?

19:51.999 --> 19:55.146
- Your father.
- Why? Where is he?

20:03.057 --> 20:08.192
Honey, they didn't have any spritzers,
so I got you 7Up and sangria.

20:19.770 --> 20:21.558
Alan?

20:22.587 --> 20:26.403
Oh, hey, baby. Have you
tried your mom's banana bread?

20:40.049 --> 20:41.447
I'm back.

20:41.457 --> 20:43.665
I'm shocked.

20:48.260 --> 20:51.257
- Hey, Alan.
- Yeah?

20:51.746 --> 20:55.223
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you!

20:59.169 --> 21:01.776
- I told you he would be back.
- Who?
