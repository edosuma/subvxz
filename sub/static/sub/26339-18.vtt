WEBVTT

00:01.241 --> 00:02.876
You know, I'm just gonna say it.

00:02.901 --> 00:04.476
The new art teacher is a hottie.

00:04.507 --> 00:07.277
Normally, I would never
objectify a teacher,

00:07.319 --> 00:08.553
but... damn.

00:08.586 --> 00:11.223
Oh, man. That rack
really defies gravity.

00:11.257 --> 00:13.059
Whose rack defies gravity?

00:13.091 --> 00:14.127
Hey, Graham, look over there!

00:14.159 --> 00:16.228
You know, the key
to uncomfortable questions

00:16.261 --> 00:17.561
is distraction.

00:18.664 --> 00:20.999
That child screaming
is just a happy coincidence.

00:21.033 --> 00:22.668
Oh, my God. She's gonna fall!

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074

00:37.783 --> 00:39.152
It's gonna be okay.

00:39.185 --> 00:40.853
Ow!

00:40.886 --> 00:42.255
A bee stung me!

00:47.393 --> 00:48.761
It's gonna be okay.

00:48.794 --> 00:51.164
Thank y...

01:02.887 --> 01:04.709
It's gonna be... okay.

01:04.742 --> 01:05.845
Please.

01:10.216 --> 01:12.025
Thanks.

01:12.050 --> 01:14.219
- Oh, my God.
- That was amazing.

01:14.244 --> 01:17.322
- What just happened?
- Will is the new hot person.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.896
Thank goodness I've done
all those laundry squats.

01:24.929 --> 01:27.366
You know?

01:27.398 --> 01:29.701
I know I'm supposed to be
at the office by now,

01:29.735 --> 01:32.038
but I just can't
take my eyes off of this.

01:32.071 --> 01:33.506
Look at 'em swarm, Miggy.

01:33.538 --> 01:36.208
Like wasps on a soda can.

01:36.241 --> 01:38.877
Man, is it me, or am I getting
more attention than usual?

01:38.910 --> 01:40.378
You've got the glow.

01:40.411 --> 01:42.981
Your little show of lifesaving heroics

01:43.015 --> 01:45.760
has wrapped you in a cloak
of sexual irresistibility.

01:45.785 --> 01:48.221
Mm. That'll make
for a nice change of pace.

01:48.255 --> 01:50.256
Wait. Does this mean you'll
finally watch sports with me?

01:50.290 --> 01:52.493
- O-Okay, look. Pump the brakes.
- Okay.

01:52.526 --> 01:55.429
The glow is powerful, yet fleeting.

01:55.461 --> 01:57.264
When it's gone, it's gone.

01:57.297 --> 01:59.700
Damn, Douglas, how you know
so much about sex cloaks?

02:00.858 --> 02:03.828
It was Labor Day, 1984.

02:04.821 --> 02:07.941
I had just bought an outfit
off the mannequin at Penney's.

02:07.973 --> 02:11.110
Jeans so white, you'd go blind
just looking at them.

02:11.144 --> 02:13.614
And, boy, did they fit.

02:13.647 --> 02:14.815
Everyone wanted a piece.

02:14.847 --> 02:16.976
I thought I would glow forever,

02:17.001 --> 02:20.154
but by the next day, it was gone.

02:20.186 --> 02:22.288
Wait. I only get a day
with my sex cloak?

02:22.322 --> 02:23.999
That's shorter than a tuxedo rental.

02:24.024 --> 02:24.957
Douglas, what do I do?

02:24.990 --> 02:26.125
Okay, look. We'll hit the club.

02:26.159 --> 02:27.261
Don't worry about it, kid.

02:27.293 --> 02:29.095
I'm not gonna let you
squander your glow.

02:29.128 --> 02:30.930
But you're gonna have to lose
the fanny pack.

02:33.299 --> 02:35.935
I wish I could stay and watch
"The Bachelor" with you.

02:35.969 --> 02:38.052
I've been meaning to ask you
one question, though.

02:38.076 --> 02:39.639
- Hmm?
- What's a virgin?

02:40.639 --> 02:43.177
So, Louisa's party's gonna be fun, huh?

02:43.209 --> 02:44.445
If you call playing marbles

02:44.477 --> 02:46.279
'cause they don't have cable "fun."

02:47.481 --> 02:51.118
Ah. Just a strong woman
buying herself roses.

02:51.150 --> 02:52.886
And this is why I tell you to just honk.

02:52.918 --> 02:54.120
Ror, get your stuff.

02:54.154 --> 02:57.173
Your mailman left this box
in the flower bed.

02:57.198 --> 02:59.492
You might want to think about
tipping him at Christmas.

02:59.525 --> 03:00.793
Please. I'll start tipping him

03:00.827 --> 03:03.364
when he stops saying
he has a "big package" for me.

03:03.397 --> 03:05.399
All right, drunk 2:00 AM Poppy,

03:05.431 --> 03:07.567
what'd you buy online for me now?

03:07.601 --> 03:09.036
Hmm.

03:09.068 --> 03:10.237
Wow.

03:10.269 --> 03:11.505
"Smash Me."

03:11.537 --> 03:12.739
- Don't do it.
- Oh, I'm doing it.

03:13.739 --> 03:14.874
Oh!

03:14.907 --> 03:16.209
What is that?

03:16.243 --> 03:18.078
What's in here?

03:21.214 --> 03:22.316
Ron.

03:22.348 --> 03:24.884
An invitation
to your ex-husband's wedding.

03:24.917 --> 03:27.587
Probably wanting me to... say something

03:27.620 --> 03:29.722
to help you express your feelings.

03:29.756 --> 03:31.692
Onwards and upwards.

03:31.725 --> 03:32.759
Huh?

03:32.792 --> 03:35.328
Harness your womanhood.

03:35.362 --> 03:36.964
Yas, queen!

03:38.030 --> 03:39.532
- Okay, well...
- There, there, there.

03:39.566 --> 03:41.702
As much as this is not working,
you're off the hook.

03:41.734 --> 03:44.036
I already know you have plans
to parade "Hot Will" around town

03:44.070 --> 03:45.805
like a piece of meat, so...

03:48.240 --> 03:49.642
You want me to stay?

03:51.445 --> 03:53.446
- All right, ready!
- Ready?

03:53.479 --> 03:55.548
Ready for some sleepover action?

03:55.582 --> 03:56.716
Honey, I bring the action

03:56.750 --> 03:57.951
everywhere I go.

03:57.983 --> 03:59.585
- Love you.
- Love <i> you.</i>

03:59.619 --> 04:01.255
Keep marchin', Penguin!

04:01.287 --> 04:02.422
Why do I keep doing that?

04:02.455 --> 04:04.291
I don't know. But I'm gonna be fine.

04:11.096 --> 04:12.298
Ang, Poppy.

04:12.332 --> 04:13.934
I need you to come over ASAP.

04:13.966 --> 04:15.234
We're having a "Bachelor" night.

04:15.267 --> 04:16.269
Dress code... formal.

04:16.303 --> 04:18.471
Attitude... full bitch mode!

04:18.505 --> 04:19.639
Later, Pops!

04:24.444 --> 04:25.446
The sleepover's canceled.

04:25.478 --> 04:27.447
Louisa's been taken by the fever.

04:27.481 --> 04:31.571
- Father... bring me my ice bucket.
- Right away, Louisa.

04:31.596 --> 04:33.921
I just need to get these children home.

04:33.954 --> 04:35.088
Don't worry about us.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.889
We've got a phone. We'll call our dad.

04:36.923 --> 04:38.725
Sincerest thanks.

04:38.757 --> 04:40.394
Please pray for our sweet Louisa.

04:40.426 --> 04:42.296
Her fever's broken 100.

04:43.762 --> 04:45.731
So, where are we going?

04:45.764 --> 04:48.101
You said you were gonna call Douglas.

04:48.134 --> 04:51.138
Come on. Where's the craziest
place we can go right now?

04:53.173 --> 04:54.308
I got it!

04:55.341 --> 04:56.310
School?!

04:56.343 --> 04:58.145
You wanted to go to school?

04:58.178 --> 05:00.580
This is what we get
for letting the nerd decide.

05:07.053 --> 05:09.668
Feel that, Will? All eyes are on you.

05:09.693 --> 05:12.159
They are? What about my butt?
Are they looking at my butt?

05:12.192 --> 05:13.994
Oh, they're looking at <i> everything.</i>

05:14.026 --> 05:17.130
Go ahead. Let them taste the pheromones.

05:17.163 --> 05:18.632
Yo, when you said, "Let's hit the club,"

05:18.664 --> 05:20.433
I thought you meant "da club."

05:20.466 --> 05:22.101
Here's the plan.
You're gonna walk the room,

05:22.134 --> 05:23.437
you're gonna get the numbers,

05:23.469 --> 05:25.872
and Miggy and I,
we're gonna surf your wake.

05:28.642 --> 05:31.278
Okay, I opened a third bottle of wine,

05:31.310 --> 05:32.645
and we are still wearing our bras,

05:32.678 --> 05:34.313
which means that we're quite tame

05:34.346 --> 05:36.282
considering it's "Bachelor" night.

05:36.315 --> 05:37.717
Look at all these hot people,

05:37.750 --> 05:41.954
you know, just falling in love
in their crocheted bikinis,

05:41.988 --> 05:43.490
diving off cliffs,

05:43.522 --> 05:46.058
which... FYI... is about them
taking an <i> emotional</i> leap.

05:46.091 --> 05:48.628
Okay, I feel like you're
going through something here.

05:48.661 --> 05:50.663
The man sent me a wedding invitation

05:50.697 --> 05:52.332
that looks like a Las Vegas production!

05:52.365 --> 05:53.333
Of course I am!

05:53.365 --> 05:55.668
Let it out. I'm here.

05:55.702 --> 05:58.872
It just hit me harder than
I thought it would, you know?

05:58.904 --> 06:00.406
I mean, I don't want to be
married to the man.

06:00.440 --> 06:01.909
- Mnh-mnh.
- He went to that Fyre Festival

06:01.942 --> 06:03.076
and came home with no complaints.

06:03.108 --> 06:04.644
Why does he get to be happy?

06:04.678 --> 06:06.647
No one is supposed to be happy!

06:06.680 --> 06:08.582
That is the deal
we all make as a society.

06:08.615 --> 06:10.550
Well,<i> you're</i> happy. You have a good guy.

06:10.584 --> 06:12.418
I know. Owen's great.

06:12.452 --> 06:14.510
Yeah, he left a wallet
full of cash at my place,

06:14.535 --> 06:15.656
and when he came back to pick it up,

06:15.688 --> 06:17.757
he didn't even check to see
if anything was missing.

06:17.791 --> 06:19.425
Which is good 'cause I took 20 bucks.

06:19.459 --> 06:21.762
What?! That is so sweet.

06:21.795 --> 06:25.065
Things are good with Owen now,
but that doesn't mean anything.

06:25.098 --> 06:27.534
Things were great with
Graham's dad in the beginning.

06:27.567 --> 06:29.142
No, you said he was human trash.

06:29.167 --> 06:31.037
Yeah, no. He didn't start out that way.

06:31.070 --> 06:32.104
They never do.

06:32.137 --> 06:33.774
That's how they get ya.

06:33.807 --> 06:35.242
There is no happy ending.

06:35.274 --> 06:37.243
You either break up or watch them die.

06:37.276 --> 06:39.512
Or... Or <i> you</i> die,

06:39.546 --> 06:41.582
and then the last thought that you have

06:41.615 --> 06:43.417
before you go off into the light is,

06:43.449 --> 06:45.252
"Great, now I made a hot widow

06:45.284 --> 06:46.919
to tramp around the nursing home!"

06:46.952 --> 06:49.089
And you know what else
is straight-up baloney?!

06:49.122 --> 06:50.557
Girl, don't make me beg.

06:50.589 --> 06:52.258
We only get disappointed

06:52.291 --> 06:55.410
because we're fed
all this BS about romance!

06:55.443 --> 06:57.905
- By like, the media.
- Yes.

06:57.930 --> 06:59.933
- And storybooks!
- Ugh!

06:59.958 --> 07:02.341
And the supportive messages
on Dove wrappers!

07:02.365 --> 07:04.471
So stupid! Someone's
gotta tell these ladies

07:04.504 --> 07:06.106
that they're getting
all gussied up for nothing.

07:06.139 --> 07:08.108
- For a lie!
- Yeah. Yeah, you're right!

07:08.141 --> 07:09.276
You know what?

07:09.308 --> 07:12.279
We owe it to these
"Bachelor" ladies to tell them

07:12.312 --> 07:14.281
that their blowouts won't save 'em!

07:14.313 --> 07:16.382
They are group-dating straight to hell!

07:16.416 --> 07:18.250
And you know what else?
This Bachelor Mansion,

07:18.284 --> 07:20.286
it's not some... some faraway castle.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.154
It's just a house in Agoura Hills

07:22.187 --> 07:24.057
that's like an hour away from here!

07:24.089 --> 07:25.659
Yeah!

07:25.692 --> 07:28.461
Oh. Angie D'Amato.

07:28.495 --> 07:31.131
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

07:32.865 --> 07:34.034
Shave Will's beard.

07:35.134 --> 07:36.168
The Bachelor Mansion.

07:55.855 --> 07:58.158
This is crazy!

07:58.190 --> 08:01.094
We are at the Bachelor Mansion!

08:01.127 --> 08:04.501
Yes! And the driveway's
wet, like it always is!

08:04.534 --> 08:05.766
No, no, no!

08:05.806 --> 08:08.642
Ohh! I wanted to get out of
that car, like, five more times.

08:08.668 --> 08:10.600
I was gonna have you shoot
a close-up of my foot.

08:10.625 --> 08:11.726
Yeah.

08:12.850 --> 08:13.973
Girl.

08:14.569 --> 08:17.511
- Giiirrrl!
- Giiirrrl!

08:18.530 --> 08:20.513
- Okay, we're going in.
- Yes!

08:22.916 --> 08:24.718
Super quiet.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.820
There's... no one... here.

08:26.853 --> 08:31.124
There's not a Becca or Lauren
or Jennifer H. in sight.

08:31.156 --> 08:32.224
Wait!

08:32.256 --> 08:33.525
Oh, my God.

08:33.559 --> 08:35.660
They're not filming "The
Bachelor" right now, are they?

08:35.695 --> 08:37.964
They must have stopped shooting
months ago.

08:37.996 --> 08:40.032
I just realized
we don't know how TV works.

08:40.065 --> 08:41.701
My phone's dead.

08:41.734 --> 08:42.735
Damn it. Mine too.

08:42.768 --> 08:44.370
I told Rory to stop wasting my battery

08:44.403 --> 08:46.572
with his competitive
dog-grooming videos.

08:46.605 --> 08:48.841
So this is how it ends.

08:48.874 --> 08:50.409
We die at the Bachelor Mansion.

08:51.578 --> 08:53.413
Hello? Who's there?

08:53.445 --> 08:56.315
Chris... Harrison?

08:56.348 --> 08:57.651
Hello, m'lord.

08:57.684 --> 08:59.086
Ladies, I don't mean to interrupt,

08:59.118 --> 09:02.089
but my ears are highly sensitive
to the sound of female voices.

09:03.956 --> 09:05.272
Would you ladies like to come in?

09:06.959 --> 09:09.095
Are you asking if...

09:09.128 --> 09:12.465
we would accept this invitation
to the Bachelor Mansion?

09:13.299 --> 09:15.235
Sorry. I just...

09:15.267 --> 09:16.769
Y-You know.

09:16.802 --> 09:19.572
It's fine. It would be weird
if you <i> didn't</i> do a rose thing.

09:19.605 --> 09:21.240
Come on in. Come on.

09:21.273 --> 09:22.743
Uhhhhh...

09:24.611 --> 09:26.079
You know, when I woke up this morning,

09:26.112 --> 09:28.682
I didn't think I was gonna
save a girl's life three times.

09:28.714 --> 09:31.218
But fate had other ideas.

09:31.251 --> 09:32.752
I was standing next to him,

09:32.786 --> 09:35.255
and I could feel him
drawing strength from me.

09:35.287 --> 09:37.022
By the way, I know Dennis Franz.

09:37.055 --> 09:39.425
Hey. I'm Bobbi... with an "i."

09:39.459 --> 09:41.094
I'm Miggy... with a "y."

09:41.127 --> 09:42.462
You're funny.

09:42.494 --> 09:43.763
You're hysterical.

09:43.796 --> 09:45.431
Oh. Okay.

09:45.464 --> 09:46.899
I'm afraid we're out of time, ladies.

09:46.932 --> 09:48.968
I guess we'll see you on the fairway.

09:49.002 --> 09:50.637
- Miggy, quickly.
- Nice to meet you.

09:50.670 --> 09:53.473
- I got five numbers and one fax.
- Wow.

09:53.506 --> 09:54.875
How you doing, gorgeous?

09:54.907 --> 09:57.810
Well, I'm new to being hot,
so I'm no expert, but, uh,

09:57.844 --> 10:00.946
is it normal to feel
both flattered and tired

10:00.979 --> 10:03.082
and like your soul
is caving in on itself?

10:03.116 --> 10:04.918
That's 'cause you're cooking with gas!

10:04.950 --> 10:07.253
Hey, guys, guys. What do you
think about Bobbi with an "i"?

10:07.286 --> 10:09.089
Oh, please. That was forever ago.

10:09.122 --> 10:10.957
She's probably dead by now. Onward.

10:10.989 --> 10:12.424
Oh, hey! It's my boss!

10:12.458 --> 10:13.959
I'm just gonna run and say hi.

10:13.993 --> 10:15.929
No, no, no! You don't
waste your glow on your boss.

10:15.962 --> 10:18.899
It's like those actors who take
their moms to the Oscars.

10:18.931 --> 10:19.932
Yeah, I love that, too.

10:19.965 --> 10:21.501
Wait, wait. Wait.

10:22.801 --> 10:24.436
Hello.

10:24.469 --> 10:26.272
I know Dennis Franz.

10:26.305 --> 10:27.807
Tracy. Oh, my God.

10:27.840 --> 10:30.810
I am so happy to see you...
a friendly face.

10:30.844 --> 10:32.244
Will? What are you doing here?

10:32.277 --> 10:33.613
- Oh...
- Wait.

10:33.646 --> 10:35.115
Are you wearing wardrobe?

10:35.140 --> 10:36.790
Did you clear that with Deborah?

10:36.815 --> 10:39.185
No, these are <i> my</i> clothes.

10:39.219 --> 10:40.252
Oh. Okay.

10:40.286 --> 10:41.988
- Do you mind if I sit?
- Sure.

10:42.021 --> 10:43.290
I'm waiting for someone,

10:43.323 --> 10:45.025
- Sure.
- but you can... keep me company.

10:45.057 --> 10:47.092
Whatcha reading? Probably
something smart, ya big nerd.

10:47.126 --> 10:48.261
Um...

10:48.294 --> 10:49.463
N.W.A.'s cookbook.

10:50.463 --> 10:52.098
- "Straight Outta Chompton."
- I know.

10:52.131 --> 10:54.767
- You can make fun of me. It's fine.
- No, no, no, no.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.469
I'm not gonna make fun of you.
Let's see what we got here.

10:56.502 --> 10:58.338
N.W.A. nachos.

10:58.371 --> 10:59.940
Nachos with avocado.

10:59.973 --> 11:02.041
Healthy option... great.

11:04.344 --> 11:05.978
Do you live here?

11:06.012 --> 11:09.516
No, but sometimes I get homesick
and spend the night.

11:09.549 --> 11:11.451
You know, do cannonballs in the pool,

11:11.483 --> 11:13.118
roll around in the rose petals...

11:13.151 --> 11:15.488
do all the things
I'm "discouraged" from doing

11:15.521 --> 11:16.555
during the show.

11:16.589 --> 11:18.224
- Pfft.
- Bad.

11:18.257 --> 11:19.725
But enough about me.

11:19.758 --> 11:21.393
Anyone have questions about the show

11:21.426 --> 11:23.028
or... your love life?

11:23.061 --> 11:24.464
Hell yeah.

11:24.497 --> 11:26.199
One-on-one me, Chris.

11:26.232 --> 11:28.300
Why are we at the school at nighttime?!

11:28.334 --> 11:30.502
This is when the Mop Man comes!

11:30.536 --> 11:31.537
Who's the Mop Man?

11:31.570 --> 11:33.706
Janitor Henderson Sr.

11:33.739 --> 11:35.741
He died in a freak boiler accident.

11:35.775 --> 11:37.244
Now he haunts the school,

11:37.276 --> 11:40.146
looking for children to kill
and turn into mops!

11:40.179 --> 11:41.481
We should go block the door.

11:46.118 --> 11:47.586
I never heard of the Mop Man,

11:47.619 --> 11:50.155
and I edit Hilltop's
paranormal newsletter.

11:50.189 --> 11:52.392
Please. I made him up to scare Graham.

11:52.425 --> 11:54.194
Guys, help me! Come on!

11:55.228 --> 11:57.597
Deep down, I think he enjoys the thrill.

11:57.629 --> 11:59.498
Great. D'Amato's having a meltdown.

11:59.531 --> 12:02.535
Is <i> this</i> what you imagined, Sophie?

12:04.103 --> 12:07.073
And I see her dangling there,
so I called out, "Look!

12:07.105 --> 12:09.742
That little girl's about to fall!"

12:09.776 --> 12:11.745
Some people are calling me
the "Look Guy."

12:11.777 --> 12:14.447
When's the, uh... cute one coming back?

12:17.617 --> 12:18.952
This is a disaster.

12:18.984 --> 12:22.555
We're sinking faster
than the RMS <i> Lusitania.</i>

12:22.588 --> 12:23.924
Oh, I don't know.

12:23.956 --> 12:26.759
I think I'm getting vibes
from Bobbi the golf lady.

12:26.792 --> 12:28.094
Oh, boy.

12:28.127 --> 12:30.430
Maybe she'll do that thing where
she puts her arms around me

12:30.463 --> 12:32.265
and teaches me how to swing a golf club.

12:32.297 --> 12:33.599
You know, like in "Tin Cup."

12:33.632 --> 12:35.267
Have you even <i> seen</i> "Tin Cup"?

12:35.300 --> 12:36.936
Nah, dawg. I read the synopsis.

12:36.969 --> 12:38.704
What the hell's taking Will so long?

12:38.738 --> 12:41.085
Come on... a whole-station karaoke night?

12:41.117 --> 12:42.282
We gotta put it on the books.

12:42.307 --> 12:43.475
No, we tried it once.

12:43.508 --> 12:45.277
- Guy McCormick got so drunk...
- Of course.

12:45.310 --> 12:46.946
...he stole all the mics...

12:46.979 --> 12:49.748
...and he treated us
to a four-hour concert.

12:49.781 --> 12:51.084
You know, that sounds terrible,

12:51.117 --> 12:52.419
but I'm also sorta sad I missed it.

12:54.619 --> 12:55.988
Mm.

12:56.955 --> 12:58.090
Oh.

12:58.123 --> 12:59.325
He's not coming.

12:59.358 --> 13:00.326
Shocker.

13:00.359 --> 13:01.427
Who's that?

13:01.460 --> 13:04.163
Travis, my... boyfriend...

13:04.196 --> 13:05.264
kind of.

13:05.297 --> 13:06.765
We're always stopping and starting.

13:06.799 --> 13:10.670
It's... It's kind of like
when you're on a Ferris wheel

13:10.703 --> 13:12.505
and it breaks down at the top

13:12.537 --> 13:15.941
and... all you can do
is kick and scream...

13:15.974 --> 13:17.776
"Help! I don't want to die here!"

13:17.801 --> 13:20.079
Yeah, I sort of feel like
all of my relationships

13:20.113 --> 13:22.648
have been assembled by
carnies, so I get it.

13:24.017 --> 13:25.986
Do you want to get food?

13:26.018 --> 13:27.119
Really?

13:27.152 --> 13:28.787
You'd... want to do that?

13:28.820 --> 13:30.589
- I do... if <i> you</i> do.
- Yeah.

13:30.622 --> 13:33.126
I mean, anything has got to
better than the KZOP Café.

13:33.158 --> 13:35.094
That's what I call
the vending machines at work.

13:36.163 --> 13:37.964
Okay, Will, we need your glow!

13:37.997 --> 13:38.998
What?

13:39.031 --> 13:40.132
It's nothing. It's just...

13:40.166 --> 13:42.635
Well, he's wearing
a sex cloak right now,

13:42.667 --> 13:44.603
and we're here to meet women...
as many as possible.

13:44.637 --> 13:46.439
It's a real buffet going on.

13:46.472 --> 13:48.007
Oh. Well...

13:48.041 --> 13:50.443
I wouldn't be able to sleep at night,

13:50.475 --> 13:52.778
uh, knowing I stood in the way
of you meeting

13:52.811 --> 13:54.980
- "as many women as possible," so...
- No. No, Tracy.

13:55.013 --> 13:56.448
I-It's not as creepy as it sounds!

13:56.482 --> 13:57.784
We've lost some time,

13:57.816 --> 14:00.320
but a hot baby shower
is setting up at the raw bar.

14:00.353 --> 14:01.488
What the hell, man?!

14:01.521 --> 14:03.656
Tracy and I were having
a real connection.

14:03.689 --> 14:05.058
You asked me to help you.

14:05.090 --> 14:07.292
You want to waste your window,
be my guest.

14:07.325 --> 14:09.495
Tracy is not a waste of <i> anything.</i>

14:09.528 --> 14:11.196
Maybe she's exactly what I want...

14:11.229 --> 14:13.565
one person who I actually like

14:13.598 --> 14:15.834
and... who likes me, too.

14:15.868 --> 14:16.902
I mean, Miggy gets it.

14:18.551 --> 14:21.507
He's on my guest pass.
I can't be an accessory to this.

14:21.541 --> 14:22.842
Douglas, maybe...

14:22.874 --> 14:24.844
you shouldn't be trying
to meet a ton of women,

14:24.877 --> 14:27.579
and instead, invest your time
into meeting <i> one</i> person

14:27.613 --> 14:29.082
who thinks that you glow no matter what.

14:29.114 --> 14:31.183
That way, the glow never ends.

14:31.217 --> 14:33.086
Now I'm gonna go after Tracy.

14:33.118 --> 14:34.686
And maybe you should think about

14:34.719 --> 14:37.089
who <i> you</i> should be going after.

14:40.312 --> 14:43.429
Owen is great, but when is it
gonna blow up in my face?

14:43.463 --> 14:45.065
Because it always does, Chris.

14:45.098 --> 14:46.833
Men are trash!

14:46.858 --> 14:48.160
- No offense.
- It's fine.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.569
A lot of us are.

14:49.602 --> 14:50.770
Juan Pablo.

14:50.802 --> 14:53.005
What... What am I gonna do?

14:53.039 --> 14:54.674
Look, every woman
who's come to this mansion

14:54.706 --> 14:56.041
has been hurt before.

14:56.074 --> 14:59.445
But they come here with no less
than 15 formal dresses

14:59.478 --> 15:02.581
and occasionally
a freakish costume for night 1,

15:02.614 --> 15:04.750
ready to put themselves out there again.

15:04.783 --> 15:06.618
I know that's what you're
scared of the most, Angie.

15:06.651 --> 15:08.588
But you've done it before.

15:08.621 --> 15:10.090
Graham's dad.

15:10.122 --> 15:12.124
Don't forget the twins'
karate instructor.

15:12.157 --> 15:14.193
Ohh. Master Gary.

15:14.227 --> 15:16.228
The things we did in that dojo.

15:16.262 --> 15:18.430
Love is out there.

15:18.464 --> 15:19.933
You gotta let it in.

15:19.965 --> 15:21.600
Damn, Chris.

15:21.633 --> 15:23.869
Okay, now, I have some questions
about the fantasy suites...

15:23.928 --> 15:25.938
- Right.
- 'Scuse. Coming through. Choo-choo! Hi!

15:25.972 --> 15:27.881
- Do you mind if I borrow him for a minute?
- I was still talking to...

15:27.906 --> 15:29.642
It's gonna be real quick.
Thanks so much.

15:29.675 --> 15:31.899
And, uh, scoochy-scoochy.

15:31.924 --> 15:34.079
- Here.
- Ah. Thanks, Chris.

15:34.113 --> 15:36.446
- So, back to Ron.
- Yeah.

15:36.471 --> 15:38.918
You know, I feel like I've done
so much work on myself,

15:38.950 --> 15:41.553
and now <i> he's</i> the one who gets
to live happily ever after?

15:41.587 --> 15:43.590
You're not jealous of Ron.

15:43.622 --> 15:45.925
What's really going on here? Be honest.

15:45.958 --> 15:47.594
Okay.

15:47.627 --> 15:49.896
I guess I'm scared...

15:49.929 --> 15:51.430
that...

15:51.464 --> 15:53.065
it'll never happen for me.

15:56.135 --> 15:57.737
Poppy...

15:57.770 --> 15:59.405
...I've watched 23 seasons...

15:59.438 --> 16:01.608
group dates, one-on-ones,

16:01.641 --> 16:03.810
about 150 helicopter rides.

16:03.843 --> 16:05.115
Ooh,<i> totally</i> gonna do that.

16:05.140 --> 16:08.515
Yeah, they don't love it when
you take the helicopter out.

16:08.547 --> 16:09.781
Learned that the hard way.

16:09.815 --> 16:12.451
Point is, there's someone
out there for you.

16:12.484 --> 16:14.419
He might be closer than you think.

16:14.453 --> 16:16.956
Maybe... right in front of you.

16:16.988 --> 16:19.993
Ooh, Chris Harrison!

16:20.026 --> 16:21.661
I'm feeling a connection.

16:21.694 --> 16:23.363
- It's not me, Poppy.
- Got it.

16:23.396 --> 16:25.832
But falling for me is
an incredibly common occurrence.

16:25.864 --> 16:28.267
Ladies, I am so sorry. I got to go.

16:28.300 --> 16:29.536
- No!
- Yeah.

16:29.569 --> 16:31.771
Doctor says I can't soak
more than nine hours a day.

16:31.804 --> 16:33.006
I've reached my limit.

16:33.039 --> 16:35.207
- I'll see you in a bit.
- Okay.

16:35.241 --> 16:38.877
Is it just me, or do you feel better?

16:38.911 --> 16:40.280
About, like, everything?

16:40.313 --> 16:41.948
I do. I mean, I don't know what it is.

16:41.980 --> 16:43.815
If it's the champagne
or the mansion talking...

16:43.848 --> 16:45.384
Hell, part of me feels like we're in

16:45.417 --> 16:47.052
a "Bachelor"-fueled hallucination.

16:47.085 --> 16:49.788
I wonder that every... day.

16:49.821 --> 16:51.557
- Phones are charged. There you go.
- Oh! Yes!

16:51.590 --> 16:53.560
I updated all your apps, as well.

16:53.593 --> 16:55.060
Thanks.

16:55.094 --> 16:56.228
You know what?

16:56.262 --> 16:57.964
Whatever it is, I'm just glad

16:57.997 --> 17:00.267
that there might be
someone out there for me.

17:05.404 --> 17:06.704
Hey, Ron. it's me.

17:06.739 --> 17:08.641
I'm calling to RSVP to your wedding.

17:08.674 --> 17:09.763
I'm coming.

17:09.789 --> 17:10.742
But clear some space,

17:10.775 --> 17:12.010
because I'm definitely
bringing a plus-one.

17:12.042 --> 17:13.213
I don't know who it is.

17:13.244 --> 17:15.580
10% chance it might be
Chris Harrison. What?!

17:15.615 --> 17:17.884
But whoever it is,
I'll definitely find love

17:17.915 --> 17:19.218
before your wedding rolls around.

17:19.252 --> 17:20.752
M'kay. Bye.

17:24.089 --> 17:26.724
Okay, is that a bikini bottom
floating in the Jacuzzi?!

17:26.759 --> 17:28.500
- Let's get out of here.
- Ew! Out.

17:29.730 --> 17:31.699
- Hi.
- Will.

17:31.733 --> 17:33.002
I-I know it's weird I'm at your house,

17:33.034 --> 17:35.537
but I-I was trying to text you
to explain about tonight,

17:35.571 --> 17:37.173
and then you weren't responding,

17:37.206 --> 17:38.573
and I realized why.

17:39.541 --> 17:41.477
Oh, God! Get it together, Freeze!

17:41.509 --> 17:43.778
Listen, I think...
you got the wrong idea

17:43.812 --> 17:44.847
about me tonight,

17:44.880 --> 17:46.614
because I wasn't there to mee...

17:46.648 --> 17:47.783
Hi! A man!

17:47.815 --> 17:49.517
Tracy, there's a man in your house.

17:49.551 --> 17:51.266
Travis, this is... my coworker Will.

17:51.291 --> 17:53.122
- Oh, hey. How's it going?
- How are you?

17:53.154 --> 17:54.689
He was nice enough to
rescue my phone from the club.

17:54.723 --> 17:55.791
Oh. Thanks, man. Cool.

17:55.823 --> 17:56.859
Oh, I'm no hero.

17:56.891 --> 17:58.660
I'm just a guy who saw a phone,
picked it up,

17:58.694 --> 17:59.962
and brought it back to its owner.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.229
It's what anyone would have done.

18:01.263 --> 18:03.099
- Oh, cool, man. Thanks.
- You got it.

18:06.534 --> 18:08.370
It's hard to get off the Ferris wheel.

18:08.402 --> 18:10.538
Yeah, it's why
I normally stay on the ground,

18:10.572 --> 18:11.707
eating funnel cake.

18:20.881 --> 18:23.251
You know, the last time
I wore one of these,

18:23.284 --> 18:25.054
I was getting fired from a KFC.

18:25.086 --> 18:26.487
Shh.

18:26.521 --> 18:27.923
Turn that ass around.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.196
"Tin Cup"! It's happening!

18:49.644 --> 18:51.546
The band's back together.

18:57.986 --> 19:01.122
No. Stupid.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.442
P-P-Poppy? Y-You're up?

19:21.476 --> 19:23.279
It's so late.

19:23.312 --> 19:24.713
<i>Hey. Yeah.</i>

19:24.746 --> 19:27.583
Um... somehow, I thought you'd be up.

19:33.487 --> 19:34.823
What are you doing?

19:34.855 --> 19:37.392
They were right. I <i> am</i> a nerd.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.061
Doesn't matter anyway.

19:39.093 --> 19:41.462
The Mop Man's gonna
murder all of us by sunrise.

19:41.496 --> 19:44.132
Graham, the Mop Man isn't real.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.333
Rory made it up.

19:45.367 --> 19:47.635
What?!

19:47.669 --> 19:49.505
He got me <i> again.</i>

19:49.537 --> 19:51.939
Got to give it to him...
the guy's creative.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.108
Well...

19:53.140 --> 19:55.844
I know how to get back at Rory.

20:04.186 --> 20:06.322
God! Where is the Uber?!

20:06.354 --> 20:07.922
I have to get home and pee.

20:07.956 --> 20:09.525
There's no working plumbing
in that mansion...

20:09.557 --> 20:11.025
but a curling iron in every room.

20:11.059 --> 20:12.528
Yeah, I didn't call one.

20:12.561 --> 20:13.762
I called someone else.

20:13.794 --> 20:15.631
Douglas?

20:22.903 --> 20:24.172
It hurts!

20:26.574 --> 20:28.110
What the hell is he wearing?

20:28.142 --> 20:29.169
I don't know.

20:30.178 --> 20:31.679
God. I can't hold it anymore.

20:31.713 --> 20:33.015
I'm just gonna pee in the fountain.

20:33.047 --> 20:35.550
There's no way I'm the first
person to pee in that thing.

20:37.686 --> 20:39.954
- I like your outfit.
- Thank you.

20:47.062 --> 20:48.897
Wait!!

20:48.929 --> 20:50.676
Don't leave me here!

20:52.309 --> 20:54.129
IVámonos, muchachos!

20:54.154 --> 20:56.170
My mom said she'd pick us up
right at 10:00.

20:56.204 --> 20:58.006
Relax. This is Angie
we're talking about.

20:58.038 --> 21:00.942
The woman's always late.
She's on Hawaiian time.

21:05.846 --> 21:07.014
Why are you guys out of breath?

21:07.047 --> 21:08.316
Why are you in a gown?

21:08.350 --> 21:09.685
Just get in the van, Rory.

21:11.018 --> 21:12.353
So, how was Louisa's?

21:12.387 --> 21:13.489
- Fun.
- Really?

21:13.522 --> 21:15.256
She kinda creeps me out.

21:23.455 --> 21:28.455
