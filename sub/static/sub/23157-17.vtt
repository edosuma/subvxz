WEBVTT

00:00.148 --> 00:03.083
I am not in training
to enter the Iron Man contest.

00:03.151 --> 00:05.016
A guy'd have to be crazy
to do that.

00:07.922 --> 00:10.356
I have enough cash
to pay your salary for one day,

00:10.425 --> 00:12.655
so I gotta have results
in 24 hours.

00:13.561 --> 00:15.756
- Wah!
- Come on.! Come on.!

00:15.830 --> 00:18.822
- T.M., I gotta get you dry, man.
- T.C., you're killing me.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.198
Come on, Magnum.!

00:21.269 --> 00:23.760
Who's he?
Oh, this is a private investigator...

00:23.838 --> 00:26.898
- A cop?
- I'm making a citizen's arrest.

00:26.975 --> 00:28.840
Magnum!

00:28.910 --> 00:30.104
Magnum.!

01:34.511 --> 01:37.947
Hawaii is like every
sensual woman I've ever known.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.176
She can have raging,
violent bursts of temper,

01:40.250 --> 01:43.708
followed by incredible calm
and peacefulness.

01:43.787 --> 01:46.551
Today was one of those days
of true serenity...

01:46.623 --> 01:49.558
when even the great tourist wave
seems to recede.

01:49.626 --> 01:52.186
I mean,
I couldn't believe the stillness.

02:04.941 --> 02:06.875
Man, business stinks. Hi, guys.

02:06.943 --> 02:09.138
Hi.

02:09.211 --> 02:11.146
Rick, what's the exact time
right now?

02:11.214 --> 02:13.148
You know,
everybody's on the mainland.

02:13.216 --> 02:17.277
Nobody even cares if my chopper's sittin'
there gettin' rusty, just eatin' money.

02:17.354 --> 02:22.155
Rick, the time! Right now!
Geez. It's 11:29 at the tone. Bing!

02:22.225 --> 02:24.693
That's 56 minutes.
That's my best time yet.

02:24.761 --> 02:29.460
And I know I could do better on the road, because
this last stretch of beach is all soft sand.

02:29.533 --> 02:32.161
What do you think this is,
a gymnasium?

02:32.235 --> 02:35.136
Hey, man, you stay
in pretty good shape, huh?

02:36.306 --> 02:38.774
About how many miles do you jog a day?
Only eight.

02:38.842 --> 02:40.776
Eight. Hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:40.844 --> 02:42.971
Uh, you swim a lot too, huh?

02:43.046 --> 02:44.946
Now and then.

02:45.015 --> 02:47.779
I bet you can ride a bike pretty good.
Bicycle?

02:47.851 --> 02:50.115
T.C.,

02:50.187 --> 02:53.418
I am not in training
to enter the Iron Man contest.

02:54.891 --> 02:57.792
Honest. A guy'd have to be
crazy to do that.

02:57.861 --> 03:01.126
First you swim five miles,
then you marathon 26 miles,

03:01.198 --> 03:04.497
then ride a bike a hundred miles
all in the same day.

03:06.203 --> 03:08.228
Yeah, this is Rick.
I bet you could do it.

03:08.305 --> 03:10.671
No bet. Okay.

03:11.741 --> 03:15.905
Thomas, that was Jimmy at the gate. There's a
woman here to see you. This has gotta stop.

03:15.979 --> 03:19.847
I mean, as Higgins would say, this is a
private club, not an office. Not an office.

03:22.018 --> 03:25.351
Magnum, P.I.? I'm Barbara Terranova
from Bayonne, New Jersey.

03:25.422 --> 03:28.721
Your answering machine said I could
find you here, so I came right over.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.625
Hi, Barbara Terranova.
I'm Rick. I, uh, manage this club.

03:31.695 --> 03:36.632
This is T.C. The fella you're looking for is
standing right behind you with the baseball hat on.

03:37.934 --> 03:42.997
Figures. I've only been here two days, but already
I know everything in Hawaii is a little cuckoo.

03:43.073 --> 03:47.066
Oh... Maybe you'd like to step out on the
beach where we can talk more privately.

03:47.144 --> 03:52.275
Magnum, I'm gonna be up front. I have enough cash
to pay your salary for one day... exactly one day.

03:52.349 --> 03:55.284
So I gotta have results in 24 hours.
What do you say?

03:55.352 --> 03:58.321
I'm sorry, Miss Terranova,
but no respectable private investigator...

03:58.388 --> 04:00.515
can guarantee a one-day result.

04:01.525 --> 04:04.688
Well, almost none.

04:05.762 --> 04:08.060
I know.
That's what they all said.

04:08.131 --> 04:11.225
All? I phoned every
investigator in the phone book.

04:11.301 --> 04:13.235
Oh. Well, alphabetically, of course.

04:15.405 --> 04:19.500
Thomas, we gotta do something with your
listing. We gotta move it up or somethin'.

04:19.576 --> 04:22.067
I just figured I could
count on you somehow.

04:22.145 --> 04:25.706
I mean, your voice on your answering
machine was so sympathetic.

04:25.782 --> 04:30.515
I quit my job back in Bayonne at the
Firmer Body in Ten Days Exercise Salon...

04:30.587 --> 04:34.819
and I spent all my savings on new outfits
and a plane ticket one way.

04:34.891 --> 04:38.349
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

04:51.074 --> 04:55.534
Once I said yes,
it was like punching a clock.

04:55.612 --> 04:59.776
Barbara barely gave me time to shower and
change into some gear I kept at the club.

04:59.849 --> 05:03.478
I wanted to grab a cab back
to the estate and pick up the Ferrari,

05:03.553 --> 05:06.522
but she said that would be
a waste of her time and money.

05:06.590 --> 05:09.024
So we headed downtown.

05:09.092 --> 05:11.458
On a bus. Almost fresh.

05:11.528 --> 05:13.496
I got 'em on the plane yesterday.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.622
Thank goodness I saved 'em, huh?

05:18.902 --> 05:21.803
Barbara. Mm-hmm?

05:21.871 --> 05:24.863
I understand about Roger
being a great pool player...

05:24.941 --> 05:27.102
Fantastic player!

05:27.177 --> 05:30.305
His life's dream
is to play competition on TV.

05:30.380 --> 05:34.646
But what I don't understand
is the part about the gold teeth.

05:34.718 --> 05:38.154
Ah. Well, um,
his gardening truck.

05:38.221 --> 05:41.418
Did I mention that Roger is terrific
with tropical flowers?

05:41.491 --> 05:44.483
And therefore I know he's gonna be
doin' real well over here.

05:44.561 --> 05:47.826
Anyway, his gardening truck
was rear-ended, and his mouth...

05:47.897 --> 05:50.457
Steering wheel.

05:51.468 --> 05:55.336
So, he had this friend
whose cousin was a dentist...

05:55.405 --> 05:57.339
Some friend, right?

05:57.407 --> 06:00.399
And he gave him a deal
on these new front teeth.

06:00.477 --> 06:04.504
The problem with tailing a bus
is that it can be pretty humiliating.

06:04.581 --> 06:08.108
See, a bus creeps along while
the rest of the traffic moves around it.

06:08.184 --> 06:11.676
Well, all the, uh, enamel fell off,
leaving just the gold casings.

06:11.755 --> 06:14.417
Yeah. So that's why
you don't have a photo of Roger.

06:14.491 --> 06:16.755
He's embarrassed
to get his picture taken.

06:16.826 --> 06:20.023
Come on. The next pool hall
is right up the street.

06:20.096 --> 06:22.462
Okay. Barbara,

06:22.532 --> 06:25.968
does anyone know that you've
come here looking for Roger?

06:26.036 --> 06:28.436
Ha.! Only half of Bayonne.

06:28.505 --> 06:32.134
I tried to stop my mother, but she
insisted on giving an elopement party.

06:32.208 --> 06:34.472
Which is a first for New Jersey.

06:43.853 --> 06:48.119
I would be paranoid to assume the blue
sedan was following Barbara and me.

06:48.191 --> 06:50.284
There were plenty
of other people on the bus.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.523
But private investigators
are paid to be paranoid.

06:53.596 --> 06:56.895
So I made a mental note to check
for the car when we came out.

06:56.966 --> 07:01.460
I wonder if Barbara realized just how
careful I was being on her behalf.

07:09.045 --> 07:11.570
- Yes, Mr. Masters?
- Hi, Higgins. It's me.

07:11.648 --> 07:15.175
Magnum, why must you always call me
on Robin Masters's private line...

07:15.251 --> 07:18.311
when there are four other perfectly
good phone lines into the estate?

07:18.388 --> 07:21.824
Well, it's the only number
that I can remember.

07:21.891 --> 07:24.189
Um, Higgins, can I have the Ferrari?

07:24.260 --> 07:27.320
- You're asking?
- Of course I'm asking.

07:27.397 --> 07:29.865
This isn't like you, Magnum.
Not like you at all.

07:29.933 --> 07:31.992
Well, I... I need it delivered.

07:32.068 --> 07:36.198
Delivered?
Look, Higgins, I only have 24...

07:37.807 --> 07:42.005
23 hours to solve this case that I'm on,
and I can't do it riding around on a bus.

07:42.078 --> 07:45.844
A bus? You're on a case
and you're riding on a bus?

07:47.617 --> 07:51.678
Don't laugh, Higgins. Some of your
best investigators use buses.

07:51.755 --> 07:55.782
Buses can't be tailed. You can always
spot a tail when you're riding on a bus.

07:55.859 --> 07:58.953
Oh, Magnum!
This is too, too much.

07:59.028 --> 08:01.258
Just get me the Ferrari, Higgins.

08:01.331 --> 08:03.799
I'm at...

08:03.867 --> 08:05.858
Honolulu Lulu's.

08:08.304 --> 08:10.966
Honolulu Lulu's Pool Hall.

08:15.278 --> 08:19.112
Honolulu Lulu's!
I don't believe it.

08:20.650 --> 08:23.517
Corner of Kaula and...
and Hannaliki.

08:23.586 --> 08:26.419
I'll send one of the gardeners
round with it. Oh, and, Magnum,

08:26.489 --> 08:28.684
don't forget to tell him
which bus to take back.

08:28.758 --> 08:33.251
I wouldn't want him to make the wrong
transfer or whatever it is one does on a bus.

08:36.666 --> 08:39.066
Nobody here ever saw Roger.
Let's hit the next one.

08:39.135 --> 08:41.568
I've got my car coming.
We went all through that.

08:41.638 --> 08:45.438
I got no time to wait around while you
wait for a car coming from... Barbara,

08:45.508 --> 08:49.376
we can cover the pool halls faster from
my car than we can in the back of a bus.

08:49.446 --> 08:52.540
Besides, how do you know Roger won't
come through that door any second?

08:52.615 --> 08:54.549
Look, I'll tell you what.

08:54.617 --> 08:57.609
My car will be here within the hour.
I'll play you for that hour.

08:57.687 --> 09:00.656
If you win, I still owe you
23 hours of investigative time.

09:00.723 --> 09:04.022
If I win, 22. But either way, we'll
have my car and we'll move faster.

09:04.093 --> 09:06.789
What do you say? You a hustler?

09:06.863 --> 09:08.831
Do I look like a pool hustler?

09:08.898 --> 09:11.366
No. Rack 'em up.

09:11.434 --> 09:14.528
Uh, no. They're, uh...
They're still in Lulu's.

09:15.672 --> 09:17.765
No. They haven't spotted us yet.

09:18.942 --> 09:20.967
All right. Right.

09:22.111 --> 09:24.807
Maybe I didn't have
a fluorescent suntan,

09:24.881 --> 09:28.214
but I'd spent my share of time
in pool halls as a kid.

09:30.787 --> 09:33.153
Of course,

09:33.223 --> 09:36.056
that was a long time ago.

09:36.125 --> 09:38.457
- Straight pool?
- Mm-hmm.

09:40.697 --> 09:44.064
Gee, I haven't played
since I learned for Roger.

09:46.736 --> 09:49.899
In Bayonne,
girls in their late 20s,

09:49.973 --> 09:52.703
or early 30s,

09:52.775 --> 09:54.766
still do that for their men.

10:04.153 --> 10:06.849
Roger and I met playing pool.

10:06.923 --> 10:10.882
I felt this... attraction to him
and asked him to teach me.

10:10.960 --> 10:13.827
When someone's showing you the
game, there's a lot of...

10:15.465 --> 10:18.093
touching and being close.

10:18.167 --> 10:22.263
Well, by the end of the evening,
he'd asked me out.

10:22.338 --> 10:26.399
It was just like in the movies. You
know what I mean? I think I can guess.

10:31.781 --> 10:33.976
Excuse me.

10:34.050 --> 10:37.019
Well, just when I know
he's about ready to pop the question,

10:37.086 --> 10:39.054
he disappears.

10:41.157 --> 10:45.355
- Ah. - Almost a year later, I
get this postcard from him...

10:45.428 --> 10:47.828
with this P.O. box
postmark, you know?

10:49.966 --> 10:52.833
Once the writing started again,
we burned up the post office.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.927
I mean torrid, you know?

10:56.139 --> 10:58.130
And then,

10:59.509 --> 11:00.942
bam!

11:01.010 --> 11:03.001
A marriage proposal.

11:04.614 --> 11:06.548
Excuse me.

11:08.084 --> 11:11.611
Well, I was so excited I couldn't sleep
for two nights. And then I telegraphed.

11:11.688 --> 11:13.781
"Yes. '."

11:13.856 --> 11:16.620
And then yesterday,
when I got off the plane...

11:16.693 --> 11:18.627
No Roger.

11:21.130 --> 11:23.098
That's 24 hours you owe me.

11:23.166 --> 11:25.100
Rack 'em up.

11:28.471 --> 11:31.440
Well? Well, we do
what we have to do.

11:42.452 --> 11:47.185
We visited so many pool halls that day and
night, I couldn't begin to remember them all.

11:47.256 --> 11:49.190
Barbara's 24 hours were about up...

11:49.258 --> 11:52.989
that is...
until your figured our pool bets.

11:53.062 --> 11:56.031
According to my calculations,
you owe me through dinnertime,

11:56.099 --> 11:58.192
which is 6:00 p.m. in Bayonne.

11:58.267 --> 12:00.394
Right.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.631
My paranoia was in full bloom.

12:02.705 --> 12:06.573
Every time we came out of one of those pool
halls, the blue sedan was cruising by.

12:06.643 --> 12:10.044
Even after we switched from the bus to
the car, his tailing didn't improve.

12:10.113 --> 12:12.343
It was almost like
he wanted to be spotted.

12:12.415 --> 12:14.349
Barbara? Hmm?

12:14.417 --> 12:17.181
Are you a girl who gets
nervous in a car? Never.

12:17.253 --> 12:18.982
Wah!

13:24.987 --> 13:27.012
Barbara,

13:27.090 --> 13:29.024
I'm going to the bathroom.

13:29.092 --> 13:32.858
In two minutes,
you go to the bathroom.

13:33.963 --> 13:36.056
But I don't have to
go to the bathroom.

13:36.132 --> 13:38.532
Please, go to the bathroom.

13:38.601 --> 13:41.570
But I... I don't have to
go to the bathroom.

13:41.637 --> 13:44.538
Please. Okay.

13:44.607 --> 13:46.598
But I don't have to.

15:31.280 --> 15:35.114
When somebody drives a car
that tries too hard to be average...

15:35.184 --> 15:37.152
and sports a haircut
with white sidewalls,

15:37.220 --> 15:40.587
government.

15:40.656 --> 15:43.625
But why would the government
care about Barbara's missing fiancé?

16:03.145 --> 16:07.582
That's funny. Higgins usually has
the dogs greet me. Yeah, me too.

16:07.650 --> 16:10.676
Except today he was
in a really, really good mood.

16:10.753 --> 16:13.950
Kept laughing
and saying something about busing.

16:14.023 --> 16:16.321
Why don't you
make yourself at home, T.C.?

16:16.392 --> 16:19.919
Yeah, that's what I'm doin'.
Uh, where's the powder room?

16:19.996 --> 16:24.262
He ain't got one of them. My
bathroom is right through there.

16:24.333 --> 16:26.324
Thanks.

16:33.676 --> 16:36.770
Rick, I want you to check
a... a light blue sedan for me.

16:36.846 --> 16:39.508
License number 5567 A.

16:39.582 --> 16:43.143
It's a... a government
vehicle or a rental.

16:43.219 --> 16:48.384
And the driver, well, he's, uh, early
20s, blond... Yeah, government type.

16:49.725 --> 16:51.659
Yeah. Uh, thanks.

16:51.727 --> 16:53.695
What are you doing?

16:53.763 --> 16:56.823
The Iron Man contest.
Oh, no, T.C.

16:56.899 --> 16:59.163
No way. I told you.
I am not entering that.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.931
Don't start again.
Not even to save Island Hoppers?

17:02.004 --> 17:05.565
I mean, I figure what I need is
better promotion, better advertising.

17:05.641 --> 17:09.008
What could be better
than to have the company name...

17:09.078 --> 17:11.137
in front of the public
in a big, fancy...

17:11.213 --> 17:13.271
Oh, I see.
You're entering the race.

17:13.348 --> 17:16.647
Did I hear somebody mention a race?
Oh, yeah. It's the Iron Man.

17:16.719 --> 17:20.382
It's a big event with men and women
if you're into competitive suicide.

17:20.455 --> 17:23.516
See, first you swim
five miles in rough water.

17:23.592 --> 17:26.220
Then you run a complete
26 mile marathon.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.458
Then, finally, the people who are still
alive, they bicycle a hundred miles.

17:29.532 --> 17:31.659
T.C. here is gonna enter.

17:31.734 --> 17:34.134
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Not me. You.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.867
Island Hoppers is going to
sponsor you in the Iron Man.

17:37.940 --> 17:39.874
Oh, no. No way.

17:39.942 --> 17:42.638
A person's gotta be crazy
to enter that event.

17:42.712 --> 17:45.806
Mm-hmm. That makes you
the perfect candidate.

17:45.881 --> 17:47.974
Besides, look at the difference
in our bodies.

17:48.050 --> 17:51.542
I mean, I'm all shiny,
muscle and power.

17:51.620 --> 17:54.817
But you...
you got the legs to win it.

17:54.890 --> 17:57.222
That's right!
And I intend to keep them.

17:57.293 --> 17:59.853
I mean, think about this, T.C.

17:59.929 --> 18:02.955
Swimming, running a marathon
and then bicycling a hundred miles.

18:03.032 --> 18:06.058
All right. What-What-What about
all this "" I owe you one, T.C."?

18:06.135 --> 18:08.228
When does that get paid?
Well, that's different.

18:08.304 --> 18:10.033
I mean, that's entirely different.

18:10.106 --> 18:13.098
Vouchers. What about vouchers?

18:13.175 --> 18:17.202
Vouchers for... for gas, vouchers for air
time, vouchers for this, vouchers for that.

18:17.279 --> 18:20.305
When are you gonna take care of that?
I'd do it, T.C. I really would,

18:20.383 --> 18:23.216
but, see, I'm on a case
with Barbara here.

18:23.285 --> 18:25.219
Ah.

18:25.287 --> 18:29.815
Now, I've had occasion during the past 24
hours to scrutinize the body in question.

18:29.892 --> 18:33.328
- Mediocre reflexes...
- Mediocre?

18:33.396 --> 18:35.523
Average motor skills... Average?

18:35.598 --> 18:38.726
And speed and endurance
of a questionable nature.

18:38.801 --> 18:42.567
Shoot! Now there's no way
this specimen could complete,

18:42.638 --> 18:45.732
let alone compete in,
the Iron Man competition...

18:45.808 --> 18:47.742
unless...

18:49.779 --> 18:52.247
Let me guess.

18:53.449 --> 18:55.383
Well, unless what?

18:56.452 --> 18:58.443
Your boy gets a first-class,

18:58.521 --> 19:02.719
knowledgeable, certified trainer
to guide him to a winning body.

19:02.792 --> 19:04.760
Yeah, but where do I get that?

19:04.827 --> 19:07.421
I mean, a dude like that's
gotta cost big bucks.

19:07.496 --> 19:09.430
Not a dude, T.C.

19:09.498 --> 19:11.523
A "dudette."
Am I right, Barbara?

19:11.600 --> 19:13.534
Modestly, yes.

19:13.602 --> 19:15.536
The pride of Bayonne.

19:15.604 --> 19:19.335
The top instructor at the Firmer
Body in Ten Days Figure Salon.

19:19.408 --> 19:23.435
And in return for my services, Magnum
continues to search for Roger...

19:23.512 --> 19:26.413
and then runs the Iron Man
to pay his debts to you. Deal?

19:26.482 --> 19:28.712
You got it. No!

19:28.784 --> 19:31.719
And a one and a two...

19:31.787 --> 19:33.721
and a three and a four.

19:33.789 --> 19:35.814
And a one and a two...

19:35.891 --> 19:37.882
and a three and a four.

19:37.960 --> 19:40.952
And breathe.

19:42.198 --> 19:45.099
And a one and a two
and a breathe.

19:45.167 --> 19:48.068
Good morning, Barbara.

19:48.137 --> 19:50.196
Very subtle.
You're wasting your time.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.365
I don't want to play.
Oh, now, Magnum.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.841
Now, the secret here,
you see, is knees to chest.

19:54.910 --> 19:57.276
Knees to chest. Try it. Now...

19:57.346 --> 19:59.837
I am heading for a swim,
and when I get back, Barbara...

19:59.915 --> 20:03.851
Babs. Call me Babs. Or Coach. Or whatever
makes you feel comfortable. Never.

20:03.919 --> 20:08.015
I will never call you Coach because I promise
you I am never going to enter that contest.

20:08.090 --> 20:10.524
Well, what about T.C.
and saving the Island Hoppers?

20:10.593 --> 20:14.461
What about Roger and me? I mean, this whole
deal depends on your entering this contest.

20:14.530 --> 20:16.555
- I mean...
- Good morning.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.691
I am sorry about all that,
believe me,

20:18.767 --> 20:21.167
and I'd do anything for T.C...
anything else, I mean. Oh.

20:21.237 --> 20:23.967
And maybe we can work something
out about finding Roger.

20:24.039 --> 20:26.974
Oh, no, I could never accept charity.
Well, then pay me later,

20:27.042 --> 20:29.033
but just don't talk to me
about this contest.

20:29.111 --> 20:32.672
Ah, the contest. The
excitement, the anticipation,

20:32.748 --> 20:35.012
the agony.

20:35.084 --> 20:39.020
Now, here are the items you requested,
courtesy of the household account.

20:39.088 --> 20:42.524
Protein powder, vitamins with
an emphasis on "" B" complex,

20:42.591 --> 20:44.821
tuna for tuna shakes.

20:44.894 --> 20:48.853
It sounds positively revolting,
but I'm sure it's quite nourishing.

20:48.931 --> 20:51.957
Higgins, what is this?
Paying out of the household account?

20:52.034 --> 20:54.332
You never pay for anything
for me out of...

20:54.403 --> 20:57.566
Wait. How'd you find out about this?

20:57.640 --> 21:01.041
T.C. told me his plans
when I let him in last night.

21:01.110 --> 21:03.340
For once I agreed with him,
and so does Mr. Masters.

21:03.412 --> 21:06.438
It's a capital idea. Robin?
You talked to Robin?

21:06.515 --> 21:08.779
By happy coincidence,
he phoned last night from Venice.

21:08.851 --> 21:11.217
I took the liberty
of informing him of the race.

21:11.287 --> 21:13.585
And you let him think I was entering?

21:13.656 --> 21:16.648
Higgins, how could you?
That's a lie.! A deliberate lie.!

21:16.725 --> 21:19.717
I must say, he was
simply wildly enthusiastic.

21:19.795 --> 21:23.595
Well, he'd been drinking. He'll probably wake
up tomorrow morning and won't remember a thing.

21:23.666 --> 21:29.036
What better way to ensure the security of the estate
than for our resident investigator to be in top shape?

21:29.104 --> 21:32.403
But I've saved
the really thrilling news for last.

21:32.474 --> 21:35.500
There's more? To signal his
support of your effort,

21:35.578 --> 21:38.012
Robin's sending you something
from Italy, air express.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.913
A World Cup racing bicycle
from Milan.

21:40.983 --> 21:43.247
I understand it cost
2,700 American.

21:43.319 --> 21:46.482
Terrific! Do you know a bike like that
only weighs seven pounds?

21:46.555 --> 21:48.853
You know what an edge
that's gonna give us?

21:48.924 --> 21:52.087
$2,700 for a bicycle.

21:52.161 --> 21:54.129
I knew you'd be thrilled.

21:54.196 --> 21:56.460
Let me know if there's
anything else I can provide.

21:56.532 --> 21:58.466
By the by, do you have
someplace to stay?

21:58.534 --> 22:02.265
A small hotel on the other side of the island.
I'll make one of the guest rooms available.

22:02.338 --> 22:05.102
So much more convenient for
your training purposes. Thanks!

22:05.174 --> 22:07.472
And, Magnum,

22:07.543 --> 22:09.511
best of luck.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.910
I know training
can be bloody hell.

22:11.981 --> 22:14.472
I was prepared to go along with it,

22:14.550 --> 22:17.018
at least until I had the business
of Roger figured out.

22:17.086 --> 22:19.554
After all, I was in top shape.

22:19.622 --> 22:23.558
Maybe we should take a break. Nonsense.
Whatever you do, don't stop.

22:23.626 --> 22:26.220
Just remember my motto
at the exercise salon.

22:26.295 --> 22:29.526
Beauty Knows No Pain. just try it. It's
gotten more ladies through my class...

22:29.598 --> 22:31.896
Please! No philosophy.

22:31.967 --> 22:36.427
We've barely come 10 miles. Now, I want to
see you sprint from here to the estate. Go.

22:37.706 --> 22:40.197
Beauty Knows No Pain. Go!

22:41.610 --> 22:43.669
Go, or it's an extra 200 sit-ups.

22:56.358 --> 22:58.553
Hi. Miss Terranova?
We'd like to talk to you.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.618
Magnum!

23:00.696 --> 23:02.664
Magnum.!

23:02.731 --> 23:04.665
Magnum.!

23:04.733 --> 23:06.633
Beauty Knows No Pain!

23:06.702 --> 23:09.136
Take it easy now. Okay?

23:09.204 --> 23:11.695
I'm making a citizen's arrest.

23:11.774 --> 23:13.742
Oh, come on, lady. Come on.

23:13.809 --> 23:16.607
Hey!

23:16.679 --> 23:18.977
- Stop it. Get your hands off me.
- Gold teeth!

23:20.983 --> 23:23.281
Don't make this any harder
than it has to be.

23:23.352 --> 23:27.118
Oh, let her go. Let her go. Let's get
out of here. We're gonna draw a crowd.

23:32.861 --> 23:35.261
Just don't lie there. Get 'em!

23:40.836 --> 23:43.600
Wait. Higgins. Wait. Easy.

23:46.942 --> 23:48.910
Better?

23:48.978 --> 23:52.914
A little trick I learned
in Shanghai just after the war...

23:52.982 --> 23:56.042
from a sturdy little Oriental chap
who demonstrated using dogs.

23:56.118 --> 24:00.350
Actually, it's still pretty bad. I think
I may be out of action for several days.

24:00.422 --> 24:03.516
- No swimming with this.
- Perhaps a little acupuncture.

24:03.592 --> 24:06.618
Let me just get my needles and we'll
try some simple muscle testing.

24:06.695 --> 24:10.187
On the other hand,
activity could be good for circulation.

24:10.266 --> 24:13.724
Let's go back to the guesthouse. I'll give
you hot packs, alternating with cold packs.

24:13.802 --> 24:17.135
No. Not so fast.
Aren't you forgetting something?

24:17.206 --> 24:20.767
- You mean?
- Yes, as a matter of fact.

24:20.843 --> 24:22.811
The Hardy Boys out there.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.073
Especially the one with Roger's teeth.

24:25.147 --> 24:28.014
I was just gonna tell you about that.

24:29.084 --> 24:32.315
You were just so busy with beauty
and pain that it slipped your mind.

24:32.388 --> 24:34.413
Roger doesn't have any gold teeth.

24:35.491 --> 24:39.086
Well, these two guys came to see
me in Bayonne about six weeks ago.

24:39.161 --> 24:41.095
Looking for Roger.

24:42.431 --> 24:43.989
What story did they give you?

24:44.066 --> 24:47.092
Even at the exercise salon
it sounded phony.

24:48.103 --> 24:52.472
They knew I was his girlfriend, and if I saw
him, they wanted me to give him some money...

24:52.541 --> 24:55.169
a check for a couple of thousand
they said he loaned them.

24:55.244 --> 24:57.109
Well, I returned it, naturally.

24:57.179 --> 24:59.170
Naturally.

24:59.248 --> 25:03.184
I'm scared of those guys. They want to hurt Roger,
and I don't know why. We gotta find him first.

25:03.252 --> 25:05.345
So you made up...

25:05.421 --> 25:08.584
the whole story
about the gold teeth...

25:08.657 --> 25:10.955
to find them while we were
looking for Roger.

25:12.494 --> 25:14.519
Do you have a photograph of him?

25:14.597 --> 25:16.189
Oh, in... in my bag.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.561
You lied to me about that!
You said you didn't have one!

25:20.636 --> 25:23.867
I know. Hmm.

25:23.939 --> 25:26.464
Fine figure of a man.

25:29.845 --> 25:32.439
Honolulu's a big place, Thomas.

25:37.219 --> 25:40.154
I'll check it out
and see what I can turn up.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.950
Come on, T.C. just one beer.

25:46.028 --> 25:49.395
You're in training.
I'm not going to have my contestant...

25:49.465 --> 25:52.400
barfing his guts all over the race
from guzzling beer.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.959
Okay. Okay. Have it your way.

25:55.037 --> 25:58.268
Just because I thought
it would help me forget how...

25:58.340 --> 26:00.399
sore my shoulder really is.

26:00.476 --> 26:03.502
Aw. Well, Beauty Knows No Pain.

26:03.579 --> 26:05.809
And I should know. Cut that out!

26:05.881 --> 26:10.181
- You really believe everything she's
telling you about Roger, huh? - Yeah. Sure.

26:11.186 --> 26:13.620
Well, 65% I believe.

26:14.690 --> 26:17.158
Hey, what about that, uh,
government guy in the sedan?

26:17.226 --> 26:19.592
Why is he nosin' around? Oh, great.
Goons and government.

26:19.662 --> 26:21.630
That's big time.
That's mob, Thomas.

26:21.697 --> 26:25.497
Rick, I am not jumping to any conclusions.
just 'cause it looks like...

26:25.567 --> 26:28.365
just cause it looks like
he is a government witness.

26:28.437 --> 26:31.099
Whoa. Roger's a mob stool pigeon?

26:31.173 --> 26:34.006
Bullets flyin' all over the place,
and you got a race?

26:34.076 --> 26:35.805
You really believe her, huh?
Rick!

26:35.878 --> 26:40.008
Okay, okay. I told you I'd check it
out, and, Thomas, I will check it out.

26:40.082 --> 26:42.016
Um, Thomas, listen.

26:42.084 --> 26:44.382
I thought after the race
I'd throw a little celebration.

26:44.453 --> 26:46.921
Like a congratulation gesture.
Yeah, yeah. Just us guys.

26:46.989 --> 26:49.014
Yeah. And maybe
a couple of TV reporters.

26:49.091 --> 26:52.458
You know, a human interest story.
Get a little publicity for T.C.

26:52.528 --> 26:55.326
You know, war buddy helps pal.
Yeah.

26:55.397 --> 26:57.331
TV reporters.

26:58.634 --> 27:01.728
And how about
some wire service stringers,

27:01.804 --> 27:03.897
Rick and a couple of photographers,
Life Maga...

27:03.972 --> 27:05.963
Thomas? Thomas.

27:50.452 --> 27:53.546
Magnum, it's here. Ta-da!

27:53.622 --> 27:55.613
It's glorious, isn't it?

27:55.691 --> 27:59.457
I'm surprised that it arrived so soon.
Yea. Terrific.

27:59.528 --> 28:03.624
I'll just have a go at the gears.
Then you can take her out for a spin.

28:03.699 --> 28:06.293
Double-time it, Magnum.
Swimsuit on.

28:06.368 --> 28:10.429
Mr. Higgins, if you could have it ready by the time
Magnum finishes his swim, that would be perfect.

28:10.506 --> 28:13.771
No problem. Actually, Magnum,
I quite envy you the bike race...

28:13.842 --> 28:16.310
because the course cuts through
the Austin Memorial Gardens,

28:16.378 --> 28:18.471
which are normally
off-limits to visitors.

28:18.547 --> 28:20.640
I've been there. You have?

28:20.716 --> 28:23.150
Yeah. Well, Roger wrote about
the Austin Gardens a lot,

28:23.218 --> 28:25.550
so it was the first place
I went when I landed.

28:25.621 --> 28:27.851
He worked there
when he first came to the Islands.

28:27.923 --> 28:30.949
Why didn't you tell me this?
I'm your investigator.

28:32.027 --> 28:33.961
I don't know.

28:34.029 --> 28:37.226
Well, he wasn't there.
They didn't know where he'd gone.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.961
But they said he was wonderful
with tropical flowers.

28:40.035 --> 28:41.969
We have got to talk.

28:43.205 --> 28:45.867
When you've had your swim,
then we'll try out the new bike.

28:45.941 --> 28:49.707
Barbara, I have the feeling
you're stringing me along,

28:49.778 --> 28:52.440
and it's going to stop now.

28:52.514 --> 28:54.482
What?

28:54.550 --> 28:56.848
You don't think Roger proposed to me?

28:56.919 --> 29:01.481
Oh.! Or... Or you think I'm the kind
of girl that never gets proposed to.

29:01.557 --> 29:03.991
- No, that's not what I mean.
- Well, I'll have you know...

29:04.059 --> 29:07.961
that in high school I was voted
queen of the Friday night dance... twice.

29:08.030 --> 29:11.158
And I was head cheerleader
my junior year. Barbara!

29:11.233 --> 29:14.600
Now, look, what other places
did he write to you about?

29:15.671 --> 29:17.764
None.

29:17.840 --> 29:21.276
Unless you count the place
on the card he sent me to propose.

29:23.045 --> 29:27.141
"" Dear Babs, This is where all
our dreams will come true."

29:29.184 --> 29:32.881
"" The Old Hawaiian
Aloha Wedding Chapel."

29:32.955 --> 29:35.219
That's a proposal?

29:35.290 --> 29:38.726
Well, wouldn't any reasonable girl
take that as a proposal?

29:38.794 --> 29:41.490
- Did you go there?
- Without Roger?

29:41.563 --> 29:43.497
For heaven sakes, why?

30:14.696 --> 30:16.823
Excuse me.

30:16.899 --> 30:18.924
Excuse me. Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo.

30:19.001 --> 30:21.026
You can't go in there right now.

30:21.103 --> 30:23.071
I... I'm very sorry.

30:24.373 --> 30:28.104
You can't go in there right now.
There's a ceremony in progress.

30:28.176 --> 30:31.202
That's all right.
We're just looking for a friend.

30:31.280 --> 30:34.249
You mean you're, uh,

30:34.316 --> 30:36.682
not the future
Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd Brockman?

30:36.752 --> 30:40.279
Do we look like a bridal couple?
Uh...

30:40.355 --> 30:42.619
Don't you wish to be married here?

30:42.691 --> 30:44.556
Yes. No.

30:44.626 --> 30:46.924
Oh, I see. Uh...

30:46.995 --> 30:50.795
I wonder if it'd be possible
if we could see your gardens?

30:52.100 --> 30:54.364
Oh, yes.

30:54.436 --> 30:57.769
Even in Hawaii
we're famous for our gardens.

30:57.839 --> 30:59.807
It's right around there.

30:59.875 --> 31:02.207
And for our weddings too,
of course.

31:02.277 --> 31:04.302
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.

31:04.379 --> 31:06.677
That was a fast answer. Have
you ever been married? No.

31:06.748 --> 31:08.272
Engaged? No.

31:08.350 --> 31:10.614
How about heavy fooling around?

31:10.686 --> 31:14.315
Never on the first date, and then only if
the girl is sincere and will respect me.

31:14.389 --> 31:16.323
[ Recessional ]

31:16.391 --> 31:19.326
All right, everyone.
Picture time.

31:19.394 --> 31:22.659
Now, you come over here,
Mrs., um...

31:22.731 --> 31:25.894
And... And over here
for you, Mr...

31:25.968 --> 31:28.766
Roger?

31:28.837 --> 31:30.771
Babs?

31:30.839 --> 31:32.534
Roger?

31:33.709 --> 31:35.643
Babs!

31:35.711 --> 31:38.305
Oh!

31:38.380 --> 31:41.975
What are you doing here?
Didn't you get my telegram?

31:42.050 --> 31:44.245
Roger, what did you do
to your hair?

31:44.319 --> 31:46.287
Roger, where's your mustache?
Who's he?

31:46.355 --> 31:49.324
Oh, this is a private investigator.
A cop?

31:49.391 --> 31:52.326
Wait, no.
Uh, a private investigator. See...

31:52.394 --> 31:55.022
You don't understand.

31:55.097 --> 31:57.793
Roger, wait! I love you, Roger!

31:59.568 --> 32:01.399
Get in the car.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.604
Oh! Hold it!

32:15.050 --> 32:16.984
U.S. Treasury Department.

32:17.052 --> 32:19.043
You two are in big trouble.

32:25.794 --> 32:27.819
It was a double blow to my ego.

32:27.896 --> 32:30.763
The good guys were bad guys,
and vice versa.

32:30.832 --> 32:34.268
The dumb kid in the blue sedan
turned out to be a mafia hit man,

32:34.336 --> 32:37.703
while gold teeth and his partner
were really treasury agents.

32:37.773 --> 32:41.300
And all of them, including Barbara
and I, were hunting for Roger.

32:41.376 --> 32:43.344
For different reasons, of course.

32:43.412 --> 32:48.577
It seems the love of Barbara's life
used to be Godfather Bracito's gardener.

32:48.650 --> 32:52.916
One day while tending the roses, he dug up
two million from an armored car robbery...

32:52.988 --> 32:56.424
that had been cooling until the
statute of limitations had run out.

32:56.491 --> 33:00.086
Roger dropped it into a fertilizer bag
and walked away.

33:00.162 --> 33:02.562
In a funny way I had to admire him.

33:02.631 --> 33:07.125
Walking out of a don's estate
with two million in a bag of bat guano.

33:10.405 --> 33:12.805
Barbara.

33:12.874 --> 33:14.808
Barbara.

33:14.876 --> 33:18.710
I can't believe it.
Why didn't he tell me?

33:18.780 --> 33:22.238
Well, maybe he loved you too
much to involve you. Oh.

33:22.317 --> 33:24.217
You think so?

33:24.286 --> 33:27.687
Well, he wrote you all those letters after
he already had the two million dollars.

33:27.756 --> 33:31.522
How many guys do you know who would
do that if they didn't love you?

33:31.593 --> 33:33.857
We gotta find him.
Oh, don't worry, Babs.

33:33.929 --> 33:37.387
This guy with the gun won't harm
him until he has the money,

33:37.466 --> 33:39.991
and Roger's not dumb enough to
tell him where it is. Well...

33:40.068 --> 33:42.969
We won't give up.
We'll just keep looking.

33:43.038 --> 33:46.565
Today, tomorrow... Oh, not tomorrow.
The race is tomorrow.

33:46.641 --> 33:49.201
Well, Roger's more important
than the race.

33:49.277 --> 33:53.907
Oh, Thomas, you know, I get this feeling
down deep in my solar plexus...

33:53.982 --> 33:58.316
that if you really try... I mean really
try real hard... you can win this race.

33:58.386 --> 34:01.355
And if you win, everything
will be okay for Roger and me.

34:01.423 --> 34:03.414
I mean, the police
will find him and...

34:03.492 --> 34:07.155
and he'll give back the money
and we'll get married.

34:07.229 --> 34:09.789
You know what I mean?

34:09.864 --> 34:12.527
Yeah, I know.
Beauty Knows No Pain.

34:12.601 --> 34:14.592
Yeah.

34:24.913 --> 34:30.408
? Beyond the reef?

34:30.485 --> 34:35.616
? Where the sea is dark and cold?

34:35.690 --> 34:40.559
? My love has gone?

34:40.629 --> 34:44.429
? And our dreams grow old?

34:45.667 --> 34:50.831
?Someday I'll know?

34:50.906 --> 34:52.873
?She'll come back??

34:52.940 --> 34:56.775
Remember, this is your best event. So don't go
saving your energy for the other events. Got it?

34:56.844 --> 34:58.813
Yeah. Don't forget.

34:58.880 --> 35:03.010
Hey, man, I don't want to put any
kind of pressure on you, but...

35:03.084 --> 35:05.211
I bet every dime I got on you.

35:05.287 --> 35:08.188
You what?
I guess I got carried away.

35:08.256 --> 35:10.224
No pressure?
You call that no pressure?

35:10.292 --> 35:13.284
Trainer coming through.
Excuse me.

35:13.361 --> 35:14.988
Just take it easy. Come on.

35:15.063 --> 35:17.293
All right. Has anyone given him
a salt tablet?

35:17.365 --> 35:19.799
No.

35:19.868 --> 35:24.134
Okay. I've got your glucose,
your dry socks, liniment, bandages.

35:24.206 --> 35:26.367
Bandages? Bandages?

35:26.441 --> 35:29.501
- Just relax, okay? Relax.
- Come on, Magnum. Warm up.

35:29.578 --> 35:32.308
Warm up. Yeah, get
them legs goin'.

35:32.380 --> 35:35.713
- Get them legs in shape.
- Two minutes, swimmers. Two minutes.

35:35.784 --> 35:39.584
- Oh, no.
- Don't use them too much on the swim...

35:39.654 --> 35:43.090
What? What do you think
you're doing.

35:43.158 --> 35:47.458
I'm sorry. No one informed me of the dress code.
However... Knees to chest. Knees to chest.

35:47.529 --> 35:49.827
You received this cablegram
from Robin Masters.

35:49.898 --> 35:52.423
One minute.
Swimmers, to your mark. One minute.

35:52.500 --> 35:56.334
Since your hands appear to be a
bit shaky, I'll take the liberty.

35:56.404 --> 35:59.373
Knees to chest. Knees to chest.

35:59.441 --> 36:01.966
Now bend over. Bend down.

36:02.043 --> 36:04.034
Take a deep breath. And up.

36:04.112 --> 36:06.103
"" All best wishes and good luck.

36:06.181 --> 36:09.116
"" Everyone here expecting news
of your great victory.

36:09.184 --> 36:11.379
Warmest regards, Robin Masters."

36:11.453 --> 36:14.820
Not that he wants you to feel
obligated to win, I'm sure.

36:14.890 --> 36:18.053
Thirty seconds. Trainers,
leave your contestants, please.

36:18.126 --> 36:20.788
Relax. Don't worry, Thomas.
You'll do it.

36:20.862 --> 36:23.592
Good luck, old chap.

36:23.665 --> 36:27.032
Just be cool. Just be cool.
I only bet the farm.

36:33.008 --> 36:34.771
On your mark,

36:34.843 --> 36:36.970
All right.! Come on.!

36:37.045 --> 36:39.275
Get set...

36:47.689 --> 36:49.589
Come on! Let's go!

36:52.327 --> 36:54.318
Come on.!

36:56.498 --> 36:58.398
He's lookin'great, huh?

36:58.466 --> 37:01.902
I don't know. Did he seem a trifle
tense to you? Higgins, let's go.!

37:04.205 --> 37:06.833
Well, just take all day, Higgy baby.

37:22.958 --> 37:25.984
Maybe beauty knows no pain,
but I knew I did.

37:26.061 --> 37:30.157
I figured the only way I could get through the
day was to put my body on automatic pilot...

37:30.231 --> 37:32.256
and concentrate
on something else.

37:32.334 --> 37:35.201
The trouble was
all I could think about was Roger.

37:35.270 --> 37:39.969
If Gold Teeth was right, he wasn't in a hell of
a lot of trouble... not with the feds anyway.

37:40.041 --> 37:43.499
He'd stolen money,
but he'd stolen it from a thief.

37:43.578 --> 37:47.844
If Roger turned it in before the statute of
limitations on the crime ran out next week,

37:47.916 --> 37:49.816
he'd probably get a reward.

37:56.624 --> 38:00.060
Hurry up. They're due here any minute.
All right, all right.

38:02.297 --> 38:04.561
Which brought me to Barbara.

38:04.632 --> 38:06.691
Why didn't he meet her at the airport?

38:06.768 --> 38:09.259
Did he have cold feet
about marrying her, or...

38:09.337 --> 38:12.170
couldn't he show up because he
knew someone was following her?

38:12.240 --> 38:15.573
But if he knew, why didn't he
just take the money and run?

38:15.643 --> 38:19.101
Call her in a couple of weeks
from Tahiti or wherever?

38:19.180 --> 38:22.946
Now remember the drill. T.C.,
you towel him dry, Right.

38:23.018 --> 38:25.009
Get him into the running shorts.
Running shorts.

38:25.086 --> 38:27.020
Okay, Rick, shoes and socks.
Shoes and socks.

38:27.088 --> 38:29.022
And don't forget the foot powder.
Foot powder.

38:29.090 --> 38:33.220
I myself have exactly...
four ounces of glucose.

38:33.294 --> 38:35.455
I'll get it. I'll get it.

38:36.464 --> 38:38.762
Come on, Magnum!
Come on, Thomas! Move it!

38:38.833 --> 38:40.858
Come on, Magnum!
Which one is he?

38:40.935 --> 38:43.403
He's right there. Can't you see?

38:43.471 --> 38:45.405
Come on! Yeah! Come on!

38:45.473 --> 38:47.600
Come on! Come over this way!

38:50.512 --> 38:53.276
Come on, Magnum.! Come on!

38:58.353 --> 39:00.844
Come on.

39:03.091 --> 39:05.457
- Hurry up!
- This way.! Over this way.!

39:05.527 --> 39:07.461
Over this way.!

39:07.529 --> 39:09.997
Come on.! Over this way.!
Come on, ya big lug.

39:10.065 --> 39:12.397
Come on.! Come on.!

39:12.467 --> 39:15.630
How am I doing?
This is your best event?

39:15.703 --> 39:18.069
Just great. A champ.
In contention all the way.

39:18.139 --> 39:21.267
T.C., you're killing me.
T.M., I gotta get you dry, man.

39:21.342 --> 39:23.401
Here, take off your trunks.
Hold this. Okay.

39:23.478 --> 39:26.242
And then put on these jogging shorts.
People are watching!

39:26.314 --> 39:28.339
Oh!

39:28.416 --> 39:31.749
Here. Come on.
Come on. Drink this very slowly.

39:31.820 --> 39:34.880
Slowly.
Babs, damn it, turn around.

39:34.956 --> 39:39.222
- I'm your trainer. - I don't suppose anyone
here knows the origin of the marathon.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.694
The Greeks met the Persians in battle...
Sit down.

39:41.763 --> 39:43.958
On a great plain
called Marathon.

39:44.032 --> 39:47.991
The Greeks were victorious and sent a runner
back to the city with the glorious news.

39:48.069 --> 39:50.230
The distance was that
of the modern marathon.

39:50.305 --> 39:53.331
- Rick, what are you doing? - We need
another sock, Coach. One more sock.

39:53.408 --> 39:55.399
Lacing up shoes. The young
man ran at top speed...

39:55.477 --> 39:58.275
Shoes, please. That's too tight!

39:58.346 --> 40:00.906
It's too tight!
T.C., I'm dry! I'm dry!

40:00.982 --> 40:03.246
He stumbled through
the gates of the city,

40:03.318 --> 40:05.912
cried out "" Rejoice, rejoice, "

40:05.987 --> 40:07.921
and fell dead.

40:07.989 --> 40:09.957
There's a lesson there.

40:10.024 --> 40:12.652
Come on, Magnum.
Go, Magnum, go.!

40:12.727 --> 40:14.752
Hit it!

40:16.664 --> 40:19.292
Remember.! Knees to chest.!

40:22.770 --> 40:24.499
Chop-chop, chaps. To the van.

40:26.808 --> 40:29.368
Come on.

40:29.444 --> 40:32.038
I was dying.
Everything confirmed it...

40:32.113 --> 40:35.344
my lungs, my head,
my aching muscles.

40:35.416 --> 40:37.509
So, I concentrated on Roger.

40:37.585 --> 40:40.679
I tried to think of all the reasons
Roger didn't leave the island...

40:40.755 --> 40:43.849
when he knew the mafia
and the feds were on his tail.

40:43.925 --> 40:46.689
It came down to either
a great love for Babs...

40:46.761 --> 40:50.094
or he couldn't get his hands
on the money.

40:50.165 --> 40:53.430
Yeah. I settled on the money too.

40:53.501 --> 40:57.835
I thought of all the ways it might be tied
up... investments, stocks, gold, land...

40:57.906 --> 41:00.374
ways that would take
a while to liquidate.

41:03.311 --> 41:05.336
After 26 miles...

41:05.413 --> 41:07.973
I decided it was none of the above.

41:08.049 --> 41:11.883
He'd hidden it somewhere, and he couldn't
put his hands on it immediately.

41:13.655 --> 41:17.648
By the time I got on the bicycle,
I was ready to fall over dead.

41:17.725 --> 41:20.193
I'd never make a hundred miles.
There was no way.

41:20.261 --> 41:23.458
Not even if I concentrated
on Roger and his problem.

41:23.531 --> 41:25.465
Impossible.

41:25.533 --> 41:28.798
But I had to try.
Beauty Knows No Pain.

41:30.271 --> 41:33.001
He'd hidden the money.
He had to.

41:33.074 --> 41:36.635
The statute of limitations was almost up,
but he couldn't get it because...

41:36.711 --> 41:38.804
it was inaccessible.

41:38.880 --> 41:41.474
I had it. I had the answer.

41:41.549 --> 41:45.383
Only I was so damn tired,
I couldn't pull it out of my brain.

41:48.856 --> 41:51.347
All right. Here they come.

41:52.961 --> 41:54.986
All right.
Come on, come on, come on.

41:57.632 --> 42:01.068
Come on.! Come on.!
Come on, Island Hoppers.! Let's go.!

42:06.107 --> 42:08.667
Come on, Island Hoppers.!
Let's go.!

42:11.679 --> 42:13.613
Let's go.! Let's go.! Let's go.!

42:22.490 --> 42:24.822
I'm telling you,
I don't know where it is.

42:24.892 --> 42:27.690
I buried it
under a Bougainvillea Priscilla.

42:27.762 --> 42:30.788
But that was a year ago. The whole
garden's changed since then.

42:30.865 --> 42:34.665
Ain't buyin' it, Roger. The sun's
almost gone down and the race is over.

42:34.736 --> 42:38.797
If you don't get that money before they close this
place, there's gonna be something else planted here.

42:44.679 --> 42:47.375
What's with the tender loving care?
Pull it up!

42:51.686 --> 42:54.849
Nine, 10,

42:54.922 --> 42:58.949
11, 12...

42:59.027 --> 43:01.723
Thirteen!
There's 13 riders ahead of him!

43:01.796 --> 43:03.991
This is ridiculous! It's okay.
He can still win.

43:04.065 --> 43:06.158
There's still 60 miles to go.
Tom!

43:06.234 --> 43:08.225
Come on, Magnum!

43:09.604 --> 43:12.596
- Come on!
- Did you enjoy the flowers?

43:13.675 --> 43:16.701
That was it.
The flowers. It had to be.

43:16.778 --> 43:20.214
Roger had hidden the money here in
the gardens where he used to work.

43:20.281 --> 43:23.910
Magnum!
What are you tryin' to do? Ruin me?

43:23.985 --> 43:25.976
Turn around! Turn around!

43:27.455 --> 43:30.788
It must be the ruddy heat.
I saw it happen several times in India.

43:30.858 --> 43:33.884
I remember once when the raja of
Punjab was racing elephants...

43:33.961 --> 43:36.122
in July on the Tigris Plain.

43:36.197 --> 43:38.290
There was this rogue bull.

43:38.366 --> 43:43.030
Come on, will ya, Higgins? He got behind the
raja's elephant and tried to mount him.

43:43.104 --> 43:45.368
Uh, the elephant, not the raja.

43:45.440 --> 43:48.068
Extraordinary.

44:31.552 --> 44:34.043
Hold it. Hold it, T.C.
There's his bike.

44:42.697 --> 44:44.790
Magnum! Let's split up.

44:44.866 --> 44:46.925
I'm gonna go this way. Okay.

44:58.212 --> 45:00.612
Heliconia caribaea.

45:00.681 --> 45:02.615
Fascinating.

45:02.683 --> 45:05.379
In the north it's commonly
now called lobster claw.

45:17.432 --> 45:22.199
Alpinia. Indigenous to
New Guinea. Marvelous.

45:24.872 --> 45:29.206
Ah. Alpinia oceanica. Splendid.

45:33.114 --> 45:36.572
- Your time's running out.
- Uh, I think it was closer to the waterfall.

45:36.651 --> 45:38.585
You see, I buried it at night,
and I...

45:38.653 --> 45:40.587
Find it! Yes.

45:48.129 --> 45:50.427
- Roger!
- Babs.!

45:50.498 --> 45:53.228
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't.

45:53.301 --> 45:55.428
It was too dangerous.
You might get hurt. Oh.

45:55.503 --> 45:58.666
Terrific idea.
Now, look, you better find it or...

46:01.676 --> 46:06.477
You buried the money here? A year ago. Only everything's
changed so much I haven't been able to find it.

46:06.547 --> 46:08.481
I'm not a thief, Babs. Well...

46:08.549 --> 46:11.211
Really I'm not.
It was just so tempting.

46:11.285 --> 46:14.015
But I decided to turn it in
for the reward money.

46:14.088 --> 46:18.616
Only I had to find it first. And today's the only day I
could get in here without making everyone suspicious.

46:18.693 --> 46:22.424
It's okay. It's okay. Even if you wanted
to keep the money and be a thief.

46:22.497 --> 46:24.761
Just tell me you wanted to marry me.
Of course.

46:24.832 --> 46:26.766
Didn't you get my proposal?

46:26.834 --> 46:28.893
The postcard.
With the wedding chapel on it.

46:28.970 --> 46:30.699
Would you guys find it!

46:30.771 --> 46:33.968
I love you, Roger.
I love you, Babs.

46:43.050 --> 46:45.450
Barbara! You creep!

46:45.520 --> 46:48.114
Babs! Coach!

46:48.189 --> 46:50.157
Enough!

46:50.224 --> 46:52.158
Ah, Magnum. There you are.

46:54.362 --> 46:57.388
You realize, of course,
you have no chance of winning.

47:10.745 --> 47:14.579
Well, Buddy's not saying a word.
Catching him with a gun is enough.

47:14.649 --> 47:16.981
The guy's a three-time loser.

47:17.051 --> 47:19.747
You know they're gonna put him
away for life... probably 300 years.

47:19.820 --> 47:21.583
And the money,
they still haven't found it?

47:21.656 --> 47:24.454
Roger didn't exactly give them
a pinpoint location.

47:24.525 --> 47:28.052
They're liable to be digging up that
place till the next Iron Man race.

47:28.129 --> 47:30.791
He seemed sure it was
in the Bougainvillea Priscilla.

47:30.865 --> 47:34.858
They'll find it. And then we'll get
married and go back to Bayonne.

47:34.936 --> 47:38.997
And I'll open an exercise school, and
he'll open a little tropical flower shop.

47:39.073 --> 47:41.007
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:41.075 --> 47:44.670
And everybody will come out of this pile of
bat guano smelling like a rose except me.

47:44.745 --> 47:48.112
Just think, man, I'm the one that
put up the money to sponsor you.

47:48.182 --> 47:51.879
You forget, Robin Masters made a sizable
contribution without expecting any publicity for it.

47:51.953 --> 47:55.389
Robin? What about me? I put up the
food, the booze, the potato chips.

47:55.456 --> 47:57.947
Stop it, all of you.
Tom did his best.

47:58.025 --> 47:59.959
He... He saved Roger, didn't he?

48:00.027 --> 48:02.222
Hey. Hey, the race is on.

48:02.296 --> 48:05.265
Oh, hey, man. Spare me.
I don't want to look at no race.

48:05.333 --> 48:07.460
I don't want to know nothing
about no race. Shh.

48:07.535 --> 48:11.665
Today's running of the famed Iron Man Classic
drew a record number of competitors.

48:11.739 --> 48:16.369
The big surprise of the event came in the
last leg, the 100-mile bicycle portion,

48:16.444 --> 48:18.844
when a rider
sponsored by Island Hoppers...

48:18.913 --> 48:22.405
suddenly reversed field as he exited
the famed Austin Memorial Gardens.

48:24.685 --> 48:30.055
We've got some footage of that Island Hoppers biker,
who certainly lived up to his sponsor's name.

48:32.927 --> 48:36.192
Whoever you are, Island Hopper,
we admire your style.

48:36.263 --> 48:38.197
Yeeha! Look at...

48:38.265 --> 48:41.325
And that's the news
from all of us to all of you.

48:41.402 --> 48:43.927
Good night.
