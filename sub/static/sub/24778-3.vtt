WEBVTT

00:06.745 --> 00:09.052
- Previously on "Colony"...

00:10.401 --> 00:10.445
- You took part in an
operation that went bad.

00:11.359 --> 00:11.620
I work for the other survivor.

00:12.708 --> 00:13.230
- There's a tattoo
on his right arm.

00:14.492 --> 00:17.147
- Bugs Bunny,
holding a stick of dynamite.

00:17.191 --> 00:19.149
- Yeah.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.846
- Show me the gauntlet.

00:20.890 --> 00:24.154
I've been looking
for this thing for a long time.

00:24.198 --> 00:27.288
- This camp, what are we
looking at when we get there?

00:27.331 --> 00:31.509
- It's a good place.
Sometimes it can be political.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.859
- A plan for Los Angeles

00:33.903 --> 00:35.470
after the rendition.

00:35.513 --> 00:37.515
They want to use LA
to build a bio-weapon.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.256
- Everything you think
is going to happen here,

00:39.300 --> 00:41.171
it's already happening.
In Seattle.

00:41.215 --> 00:43.652
The Resistance,
outside the walls.

00:43.695 --> 00:45.523
They've been sending
messages about Seattle.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.351
The whole colony
was renditioned.

00:47.395 --> 00:48.787
The camp needs to see
what you've uncovered.

00:48.831 --> 00:51.616
Help me get this
to the right people.

00:54.402 --> 00:57.796
[indistinct chatter
and coughing]

00:57.840 --> 00:59.755
- Got it.

00:59.798 --> 01:01.887
Told you you'd barely feel it.

01:01.931 --> 01:04.629
- You missed some,
there and there.

01:05.761 --> 01:08.372
- There's some dirt
embedded in the abrasions.

01:08.416 --> 01:11.375
Let's have a nurse clean it.

01:11.419 --> 01:13.247
You're all good.

01:13.290 --> 01:16.293
I'd milk this for some ice
cream on the way home though.

01:18.948 --> 01:20.689
Can you help me
with curtain two?

01:20.732 --> 01:23.692
- Sure.

01:28.262 --> 01:30.525
- Something's happening
in the LA bloc.

01:40.622 --> 01:42.928
- They showed up
a couple of minutes ago.

01:42.972 --> 01:45.148
My whole family is in LA.

02:09.477 --> 02:11.522
- I need your help.

02:11.566 --> 02:14.786
- My shift is over.
- It's a special case.

02:14.830 --> 02:18.877
- Then you need a specialist.
- That's why I came to you.

02:18.921 --> 02:21.445
A friend of mine
has a head wound.

02:21.489 --> 02:24.492
A bad one, and he can't
come to the hospital.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.625
- I don't handle
those kinds of cases.

02:27.669 --> 02:28.670
You need to talk
to somebody else.

02:28.713 --> 02:31.325
- There is nobody else.

02:31.368 --> 02:34.197
This friend of mine,
he was risking his life

02:34.241 --> 02:37.766
to help our neighbors
on the other side of the wall.

02:37.809 --> 02:40.812
Do you know what's
really going on over there?

02:46.862 --> 02:50.648
♪

02:50.692 --> 02:53.434
- I found a doc, was a
neurologist before the Arrival.

02:53.477 --> 02:54.913
- Well, I hope
she's a good one.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.746
Shot came out of nowhere,
I don't know why he's not dead.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.270
- He got lucky.

03:03.313 --> 03:04.836
The bullet's lodged
in the frontal lobe.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.404
- I grabbed some surgical
supplies from the hospital.

03:09.798 --> 03:11.800
- This isn't stitches
and some antibiotics.

03:11.843 --> 03:13.889
It's brain surgery.

03:17.545 --> 03:19.547
You guys have to dump him
at a hospital.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.244
Tell them he
got robbed or something.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.594
- We can't do that.
- If you don't, he'll die.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.770
- And if we do, they'll fix him
up just enough to torture him.

03:25.814 --> 03:28.686
Put us all in danger.

03:28.730 --> 03:31.646
- Tomas.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.740
- Stepson.

03:43.397 --> 03:44.702
- If I go after that bullet,

03:44.746 --> 03:46.008
there's a good chance
I kill him.

03:46.051 --> 03:48.706
Maybe paralysis.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.665
Blindness.

03:50.708 --> 03:53.494
Yeah.

03:53.537 --> 03:55.539
I KNOW.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.283
Wipe down the table
with bleach.

04:00.327 --> 04:01.719
I need a
stable operating surface

and as many towels

I'm sure there will be.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.447

04:35.275 --> 04:38.234
These people have been
living here for a long time.

I'm Andrew MacGregor.

I, uh, run this place.

Hey, would you mind?
The adults need to talk.

04:56.426 --> 04:57.993
Could you step out
for a minute?

04:58.036 --> 05:00.125
Okay?

05:14.226 --> 05:16.533
I want to know how you
got a hold of the gauntlet.

05:19.406 --> 05:22.887
- Um, my team hit
a secure train

05:22.931 --> 05:24.585
that turned out
to be transporting a RAP.

05:24.628 --> 05:28.328
A Click, and we got
the gauntlet off its suit.

05:30.460 --> 05:34.464
- The Occupation recovered it.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.074
- Well.

05:36.118 --> 05:37.946
You're welcome
to stay at the camp.

05:37.989 --> 05:40.296
Provided you follow the rules.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.429
Children go to school,
adults work.

05:42.472 --> 05:44.256
There's a strict curfew.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.389
No one's allowed outside the
perimeter without permission.

05:46.433 --> 05:49.218
And there are no
electronics of any kind.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.960
- So that's how you stayed off
the drone's radar.

05:52.003 --> 05:54.963
By keeping the camp analog.

05:55.006 --> 05:57.269
- Before the Occupation
recovered the captured Click,

05:57.313 --> 05:59.881
were you able
to interrogate it?

05:59.924 --> 06:01.578
- We tried,
it was unresponsive.

06:01.622 --> 06:04.451
Your defector,
can you communicate with it?

06:04.494 --> 06:07.932
- It's not a defector,
it's a prisoner of war.

06:07.976 --> 06:09.891
- Oh, I--
- It's good for morale

06:09.934 --> 06:13.155
for people to believe
that their enemy is divided.

06:13.198 --> 06:15.984
My team captured that Click.

06:16.027 --> 06:18.943
It's the single biggest victory
of the Resistance.

06:18.987 --> 06:22.077
Now...
I'd like you to write down

06:22.120 --> 06:24.471

in Los Angeles.

learned about the gauntlet.

06:32.261 --> 06:35.046
Anything you think
might be useful

06:35.090 --> 06:38.049
will be useful.

06:38.093 --> 06:41.401

06:41.444 --> 06:44.012
- Well, of course.
Once you prove yourselves.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.361
- I think we proved ourselves

06:45.405 --> 06:48.059
when we brought you
the gauntlet.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.453
And I'm grateful for that.

06:50.497 --> 06:53.891
Start with the book,
then we'll talk.

07:08.079 --> 07:10.473
- It's worth the risk.
They're just people.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.475
- I don't like people.

07:12.519 --> 07:15.043

Look, we're low on supplies.
We can't get a car to work

07:17.088 --> 07:19.090
since all the gas has gone bad,
and maybe those guys

07:19.134 --> 07:20.962
can give us a ride.
- A truck is too high profile.

07:21.005 --> 07:22.485
- Well they must
know something.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.356
They've been living out here
since the Arrival.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.055
- You don't know that.

07:27.098 --> 07:29.405
- It's going to take us
months to hike north.

07:29.449 --> 07:33.278
Every day
on the road is a risk.

07:33.322 --> 07:35.542

Besides, if it goes badly,

I'm not armed.

He is, but he doesn't
want to shoot anyone.

Looks like your boy
had an accident.

I could take a look.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.683

08:29.726 --> 08:32.729
It's fine.
- Not if it sets wrong.

08:50.617 --> 08:53.402

It's an oral mesalamine.

08:55.186 --> 08:58.102
Used to treat ulcerative
colitis and Crohn's Disease.

If you help us get them,
we'll give you that ride.

09:25.477 --> 09:27.392
- I don't know yet.

09:27.436 --> 09:30.657
- Vincent warned me last night
this place was political.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.615
And when we got here
with the gauntlet,

09:32.659 --> 09:34.530
they didn't exactly
treat him like a hero.

because you don't
like taking orders.

09:50.720 --> 09:54.289
Look, we came a long way
to find this place.

09:54.332 --> 09:57.118
And you heard him, they've got
a way to stay off the grid.

09:57.161 --> 10:00.164
And a school for the kids.

10:00.208 --> 10:03.385
- Yeah, they could use
a taste of a normal life.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.474
Halfway normal.

10:05.517 --> 10:08.695
- It's also a chance to be
a part of something big.

Can you imagine actually
talking to a RAP?

a safe place to settle.

10:37.419 --> 10:40.117

10:45.906 --> 10:48.691
- What if that guy
doesn't keep his promise?

10:48.735 --> 10:50.824
- Well, we brought him
something incredibly valuable.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.695
We deserve to be a part of it.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.262
- In my experience,

10:54.305 --> 10:56.264
deserve ain't got
nothing to do with it.

10:56.307 --> 10:57.787
- Well, a lot of my friends
died for that thing.

10:57.831 --> 10:59.659
I'm not taking no
for an answer.

11:03.445 --> 11:07.275
- Then may God have mercy
on this camp.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.388
- I'm Dr. Donovan Landay,
the camp's physician.

11:33.431 --> 11:37.087
- Will Bowman.
This is Charlie, Gracie.

11:37.131 --> 11:40.090
- We offer physicals
to all the new camp members.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.136
It's usually been a while since
people have seen a doctor.

11:42.179 --> 11:43.964
- That's good.

11:44.007 --> 11:46.227
- Long enough to make you
feel a little nervous, huh?

11:46.270 --> 11:49.012
- She hates getting shots.
- Oh, me too.

11:49.056 --> 11:51.058
But most of
the vaccines have expired.

11:51.101 --> 11:54.757
So these days, I rarely
chase after kids with needles.

11:54.801 --> 11:59.327
Why don't you two go introduce
yourselves to the teachers?

11:59.370 --> 12:01.198
- Go.

12:05.289 --> 12:07.944
- They'll be fine.

12:09.119 --> 12:10.338
- I know.

12:10.381 --> 12:11.556
It's just we haven't left them

12:11.600 --> 12:14.211
with anyone else
in a long time.

12:16.648 --> 12:19.564
So, what kind of things
you treat around here?

12:19.608 --> 12:21.262
- Oh, small town stuff.

12:21.305 --> 12:24.526
Accidents,
GI issues, women's health.

12:25.832 --> 12:29.096
- Got much experience
with combat injuries?

12:29.139 --> 12:30.793
- Well, you need me
to take a look at something?

12:30.837 --> 12:32.664
- No, not yet.

12:35.798 --> 12:38.322
- Everyone in this camp works.

12:38.366 --> 12:41.325
The new arrivals
always start in the fields.

12:41.369 --> 12:44.111
You should report there.

12:44.154 --> 12:47.157
- Got it.
Doctor's orders.

12:54.034 --> 12:57.037
- We call it a dead zone.
Walkers keep everyone out.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.516
It's like
there's an invisible wall,

12:58.560 --> 13:01.215
and if you cross it,
they shoot on sight.

13:01.258 --> 13:03.478
Now every store outside
the zone has been stripped,

13:03.521 --> 13:06.220
but in there,
there's plenty of supplies.

13:06.263 --> 13:08.309
- Including medicine
for your wife.

13:08.352 --> 13:10.790
- Yeah, there's a pharmacy
just across the border.

13:10.833 --> 13:14.663
And you can pick out
the drugs we need for everyone.

13:14.706 --> 13:18.449
I'll let you two talk.

13:18.493 --> 13:19.799
- No.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.409
- They're amateurs.

13:21.452 --> 13:23.324
The moment something
goes wrong, they'll panic.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.456
- Give them a little credit.
They've survived this long.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.372
- Dumb luck
only takes you so far.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.244
- We need a ride
and we need supplies.

13:30.287 --> 13:31.854
Two birds, one stone.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.769
Unless you want to hike
the entire Central Valley

13:33.813 --> 13:36.641
on two bottles of water
and a granola bar.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.687
- We'll go take
a look at the op.

13:38.730 --> 13:41.733
But if I don't
like it, we bail.

13:41.777 --> 13:44.127
- Fair enough.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.564
Can't tell me you're
not a little bit curious

13:46.608 --> 13:48.610
about what might be inside.

13:48.653 --> 13:51.874
If the RAPs are guarding it
that carefully.

13:51.918 --> 13:55.051
- Got enough
mysteries in my life.

13:58.576 --> 14:01.492
- They're watching us.
- Yeah, so shut up.

14:01.536 --> 14:04.365
- We have to keep to ourselves.
Heads down.

14:04.408 --> 14:07.716
- This isn't my first camp.

14:14.157 --> 14:16.856
- Yeah.
- Then you're on the crates.

14:20.163 --> 14:22.513
- In my more formative years,

14:22.557 --> 14:25.647
I may have held a hammer, yes.

14:25.690 --> 14:28.128
- Stencils.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.659
- Hey, you're not supposed
to walk around camp alone.

15:23.313 --> 15:27.230
- I've been assigned
to your security detail.

15:28.492 --> 15:32.496
- I can show you around
if you like.

15:33.976 --> 15:36.239
- Is that where they're
holding the Click?

15:36.283 --> 15:38.285

15:40.200 --> 15:42.332
You can't go in there.

- Don't touch me.

15:48.556 --> 15:51.167
Take me to Vincent.

16:12.014 --> 16:14.321
- They put
an armed guard on me.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.888
- It's for your protection.

16:16.932 --> 16:19.195
What does that mean?
Is my family safe here?

16:19.239 --> 16:20.718
- Of course.

16:20.762 --> 16:23.373
- Then what the hell
is going on?

16:23.417 --> 16:26.115
Why didn't MacGregor want you
to come get us from the train?

16:26.159 --> 16:28.944
Why did he refuse
to talk to you last night?

16:28.988 --> 16:32.992
- Like I told your husband,
this is a political place.

16:37.039 --> 16:39.955
- We are all supposed
to be on the same side.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.304
- We are on the same side,

16:41.348 --> 16:43.741
but MacGregor
is a very cautious man.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.308
It's for the good of the camp.

16:45.352 --> 16:47.702
We've made mistakes.

16:49.443 --> 16:51.227
The kind you make

16:51.271 --> 16:52.750

much more
powerful than you.

- No.

17:14.729 --> 17:16.992
It's not like that.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.039
- Then explain it to me.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.173
God damn it, Vincent.

17:24.217 --> 17:28.264
I dragged my family hundreds
of miles across bad country

17:28.308 --> 17:32.094
to bring that gauntlet
to this camp.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.922
I've earned
a seat at the table.

17:33.965 --> 17:36.707
- I agree, and you'll get it.

17:39.884 --> 17:42.148
Hey, this may be
MacGregor's camp.

17:42.191 --> 17:45.368
We have all made sacrifices.
- I know.

17:45.412 --> 17:47.718
Look.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.764
I disobeyed orders
to come and find you

17:49.807 --> 17:52.462
because I was inspired
by your story.

17:52.506 --> 17:56.205
And because I believe in the
possibilities of the gauntlet.

17:56.249 --> 17:59.121
But it requires
a lot of experience

17:59.165 --> 18:00.775
to navigate this camp.

18:00.818 --> 18:02.429
Let me play this out.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.213
- I get it.

18:11.307 --> 18:14.005
I've done what MacGregor asked.

18:18.053 --> 18:21.361
All I want is a chance
to speak with him.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.755
And there's stuff in there
that he should know,

18:24.799 --> 18:26.757
especially about the Click.

18:31.545 --> 18:34.200
- Okay.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.392
- Water break.

19:06.493 --> 19:07.972
Can you spare a drink?

19:08.016 --> 19:10.366
- Yeah.
- Thanks, man.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.020
Got to be some irony
in dying of thirst

- No, free lands.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.426

This place is a paradise

what we've been through.

19:29.429 --> 19:32.301
- I bet.
- Tight ship, too.

19:32.345 --> 19:36.131
Lots of ex-military
and law enforcement types.

19:38.525 --> 19:40.353
- Yeah, I guess.

19:43.486 --> 19:46.402
- Reminds me,
a Marine buddy I ran with

19:46.446 --> 19:48.143
thought he knew a guy here.

Got to be the only
jarhead in the world

19:58.284 --> 20:01.417
Kind of hard
to forget a tattoo like that.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.245

20-minute sweeps.

taking the truck in,

20:31.142 --> 20:32.579
We'll be exposed
the whole time,

walker sweep to pass,

that walk takes 15 minutes.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.114

27:29.735 --> 27:33.216
Sorry, how long have you
had your Click?

27:33.260 --> 27:36.611

need help with communicating.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.221

anything from it at all.

27:38.265 --> 27:39.440

basic of terms, yes.

27:56.762 --> 27:59.155
Absolutely.

He trusted me.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.438
I brought an offering
to the temple.

31:58.481 --> 32:02.529
Gave MacGregor everything we
know about Los Angeles.

32:02.572 --> 32:04.313
How was your day?

32:04.357 --> 32:07.273
Lots of secrets here.

32:07.316 --> 32:10.276
Snyder doesn't like this place.

32:10.319 --> 32:14.541
I'm sure he doesn't.

32:14.584 --> 32:18.806
- He survived a long time
on those instincts.

32:24.290 --> 32:26.509
- The RAP, it's online.

32:28.990 --> 32:31.210
Watch the kids!

32:42.047 --> 32:44.919
- Turn it off!
Goddamn it!

32:58.802 --> 33:01.762
- What happened to going about
this slowly and methodically?

33:15.515 --> 33:18.431
- It's a damn machine.

33:29.007 --> 33:32.532
I-i-it's a d-damn machine.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.497
It, speak.

33:52.117 --> 33:56.512
Has, it, spoken, before?

33:56.556 --> 33:59.080
- This is the first time.

33:59.124 --> 34:00.777
That's why we
needed the gauntlet.

34:00.821 --> 34:03.650
Needed. Gauntlet.

34:16.489 --> 34:20.797
Yes, understand.

34:20.841 --> 34:22.103
- Oh, my gosh.

34:22.147 --> 34:24.105
- Holy shit.

34:24.149 --> 34:26.020
Holy shit.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.637
Where, where, where.

34:34.681 --> 34:36.944
Two, seven, break, zero six,
break, one five, stop.

34:36.987 --> 34:39.120
Fifteen, stop.
Four, five, seven, positive 44,

34:39.164 --> 34:41.079
break, two seven--
- This is just gibberish.

34:41.122 --> 34:42.558
It's talking nonsense.

34:42.602 --> 34:44.560
- One, five, stop,
fifteen, stop--

34:44.604 --> 34:46.954
- No, I think those
are coordinates.

34:46.997 --> 34:49.565
98.77 parsec.

34:52.002 --> 34:53.874
- It knows our
units of measurement.

34:53.917 --> 34:56.703
- They probably knew a lot
about us before they came here.

35:08.149 --> 35:10.020
- War.

35:12.022 --> 35:14.547
- War, with us.

35:14.590 --> 35:17.027
- Enemy.

35:17.071 --> 35:20.640
- You're goddamn right
you're the enemy.

35:20.683 --> 35:24.165
- You had an enemy
before you came here.

35:24.209 --> 35:25.906
- Yes.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.127
- Not humans.

35:29.170 --> 35:32.695
You mean another species
from somewhere else.

35:32.739 --> 35:34.784
- Escape.

35:34.828 --> 35:36.177
Flee.

35:36.221 --> 35:37.744
Pursuit.

35:40.442 --> 35:42.488
- You're on the run from them.

35:44.490 --> 35:46.056
- Yes.

35:51.105 --> 35:53.194
- Resource.

35:55.153 --> 35:58.156
- We are the resource.

35:58.199 --> 36:00.462
- Labor.

36:06.599 --> 36:09.471
- Defense.

36:09.515 --> 36:11.821
You've slaughtered

36:11.865 --> 36:15.042
hundreds of millions
of human beings.

36:15.085 --> 36:17.784
- Human ally.

36:25.095 --> 36:28.098
- Enemy, pursuit.

36:31.754 --> 36:34.931
- Your enemy is coming here.

36:34.975 --> 36:37.760
To Earth.

36:37.804 --> 36:39.893
- Yes.

36:44.289 --> 36:46.813
- What will they do
when they get here?

36:48.293 --> 36:50.469
- Zero.

36:56.953 --> 36:59.217
- I don't think
that's what it meant.

37:02.089 --> 37:05.571
- Total...annihilation.

37:07.225 --> 37:10.184
Human equal ally

37:10.228 --> 37:13.143
equal partner.

37:14.101 --> 37:15.798
- It's lying.

37:15.842 --> 37:20.238
- Our enemy is your enemy.

37:20.281 --> 37:23.980
We are your defense.

37:34.643 --> 37:35.296
- We're on lockdown,
effective immediately.

37:36.602 --> 37:37.951
I want two armed patrols
for the next 24 hours

37:37.994 --> 37:39.257
in a two mile radius.

37:39.300 --> 37:40.345
Watching for any
kind of response, go.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.262
We need to get back in there
and keep interrogating it.

37:44.305 --> 37:45.785
- We can't trust
a word that thing says.

37:45.828 --> 37:47.003
- We need to keep it talking.

37:47.047 --> 37:48.396
- I said it's finished.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.703
We could have Click
or Occupation kill teams

37:50.746 --> 37:51.965
coming here right now.

37:52.008 --> 37:53.880
We need in control
of our own situation

37:53.923 --> 37:56.361
before we're worried
about that thing.

38:36.531 --> 38:38.925
- Exhausted.

38:38.968 --> 38:42.015
Glad to be
out of that zone, though.

38:42.058 --> 38:44.713
- No doubt.

38:48.891 --> 38:50.893
- What do you think
happened last night?

38:53.069 --> 38:56.116
- Don't know.

38:56.159 --> 38:59.249
- And that building.

38:59.293 --> 39:02.775
What do you think it was,
some kind of Factory?

39:02.818 --> 39:04.254
- Don't know that, either.

39:04.298 --> 39:06.866
But I doubt it's good news.

39:18.138 --> 39:20.358
- I need to tell the camp
what we saw.

39:20.401 --> 39:23.012
In case we get caught
by a drone or...

39:23.056 --> 39:25.754
whatever else is out here.

39:27.103 --> 39:29.932
- Okay.
Just be fast.

39:34.023 --> 39:36.286
I think we should get out
of the Central Valley.

39:36.330 --> 39:39.028
Head for the coast,
might be safer.

39:39.072 --> 39:41.857
- Yeah, more cover.

39:41.901 --> 39:44.860
Probably harder
for the drones to patrol.

39:47.036 --> 39:51.258
- 14, 78, 3, 52,

39:51.301 --> 39:54.261
11, 36, 101. Over.

39:57.003 --> 40:00.528
14, 78.

40:00.572 --> 40:02.965
3, 52.

40:03.009 --> 40:06.012
11, 36, 101, over.

40:06.055 --> 40:08.449
- Copy, Tania-two.

40:08.493 --> 40:11.060
- I need to get
a message to the camp.

40:11.104 --> 40:14.499
- Negative, Tania-two.
Camp signal is down.

40:18.894 --> 40:22.855
- Not since last night.

40:24.639 --> 40:26.989
- Sorry, Tania-two,
that's all I've got.

40:27.033 --> 40:28.991
Over and out.

40:34.519 --> 40:37.043
Do you think something
happened to the camp?

40:40.002 --> 40:41.308
- Don't know.

40:41.351 --> 40:44.267
But we need to keep moving.

40:47.314 --> 40:54.321
