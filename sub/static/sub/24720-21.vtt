00:02.590 --> 00:04.260
found her roommate
strangled in her house.

Getting away with murder
is an incredible feeling.

This case took over

You knew better than anyone
what kind of monster he was.

The way he injected himself
into your partner’s life,

been able to trace it.

07:48.230 --> 07:49.100
Couldn’t sleep?

07:49.100 --> 07:54.020
I would lie and say it was
the cracked ribs, but...

07:54.440 --> 07:56.980
How’d it go with
the captain?

07:56.980 --> 07:57.980
Poorly.

07:57.980 --> 07:59.730
He won’t be helping us.

07:59.730 --> 08:03.100
That’s why I broke
into the morgue last night.

08:03.100 --> 08:06.890
Made a copy of Michael’s
autopsy report.

08:07.690 --> 08:11.690
I also have
his body downstairs.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.890
HOLMES:
As we assumed,
cause of death--

08:17.890 --> 08:20.190
blunt-force trauma
to the head.

08:20.190 --> 08:22.270
So his right eye
was lacerated,

08:22.270 --> 08:23.520
his orbital bone
was broken,

08:23.520 --> 08:26.310
and the wound would have
dripped blood into both eyes.

08:26.310 --> 08:27.890
Meaning he wasn’t
just concussed

08:27.890 --> 08:30.270
when he identified you
as his killer.

08:30.270 --> 08:31.560
He was half blind.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.890
So, is that for
my modesty?

08:33.890 --> 08:34.980
Mine, actually.

08:34.980 --> 08:35.890
Don’t worry.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.350
There were
no clues there.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.059
Just confirmation
of every stereotype

08:39.059 --> 08:41.020
anyone’s ever assumed
about men who hurt women.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.890
I thought the most
interesting part of his anatomy

08:43.890 --> 08:46.480
was his upper torso.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.850
Note the wound
you inflicted.

08:48.850 --> 08:50.650
WATSON: Somebody
stitched it up.

08:50.650 --> 08:52.890
Not the medical examiner.

08:52.890 --> 08:54.890
He writes in his report
it was sutured

08:54.890 --> 08:57.900
no more than two hours
after Michael sustained it.

08:57.900 --> 09:00.400
There’s no way he
did that himself.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.850
I wager the FBI’s
canvassing hospitals

09:02.850 --> 09:05.270
and medical and veterinary
offices as we speak.

09:05.270 --> 09:06.980
That makes sense,
but I don’t think

09:06.980 --> 09:09.100
the person who did this
has an office.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.770
I think he’s a combat medic.

09:10.770 --> 09:13.350
Or at least he was
a long time ago.

09:13.350 --> 09:14.890
Looks like the
wound was closed

09:14.890 --> 09:16.890
with an oh-silk on
a curved needle.

09:16.890 --> 09:20.520
But what really stands out
is the color: black.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.310
I took a course in
emergency medicine,

09:22.310 --> 09:24.890
and the professor showed
us slides of sutures

09:24.890 --> 09:25.900
done by combat medics.

09:25.900 --> 09:28.600
Most of what he showed us
was from the Vietnam War,

09:28.600 --> 09:30.690
but the sutures
looked exactly like these.

09:30.690 --> 09:32.230
If you’re right, Michael either

09:32.230 --> 09:34.730
went back in time
to the Tet Offensive

09:34.730 --> 09:37.440
or he visited someone
with medical training

09:37.440 --> 09:38.730
and supplies from the 1960s.

09:38.730 --> 09:42.690
There’s gotta be thousands of
Vietnam vets living in New York.

09:42.690 --> 09:44.270
Yes.

09:44.270 --> 09:45.440
Lucky for us,

09:45.440 --> 09:48.890
I think I know the one
we’re looking for.

09:50.770 --> 09:52.890

09:52.890 --> 09:54.600

09:54.600 --> 09:55.770
Oh. Thanks.

09:55.770 --> 09:57.310
Sherlock, right?

09:57.310 --> 09:58.730
Yeah.

09:58.730 --> 10:00.440
Seen you at a few meetings.

10:00.440 --> 10:02.940
Denny. Vietnam veteran.

10:02.940 --> 10:04.890
Oh, what gave it away?

10:04.890 --> 10:05.890
You were
a combat medic.

10:05.890 --> 10:08.770
You, uh, suffered from PTSD,
which you treated with heroin.

10:08.770 --> 10:09.940
You were on and off it
for years,

10:09.940 --> 10:12.650
but the last time I saw you,
you were ten years sober.

10:12.650 --> 10:15.890
You shared with the group
that you had another addiction,

10:15.890 --> 10:17.520
which was collecting,
uh, memorabilia

10:17.520 --> 10:19.190
from the war
that you fought in.

10:19.190 --> 10:22.020
I was impressed
I remembered your name.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.560
That’s some
memory you got.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.850
Mmm. Actually,
it’s your collection

10:25.850 --> 10:27.600
I’d like to talk
to you about.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.190
Safe to assume
that you’ve acquired

10:29.190 --> 10:33.190
a vintage medical field kit
or two over the years?

10:33.810 --> 10:36.100
Yeah, meeting’s getting started.
We should find some seats.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.400
No, I think we should take this
conversation somewhere else.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.020
Unless you’d like me
to share with the group

10:40.020 --> 10:43.940
that you stitched up a wounded
serial killer the other night.

10:45.810 --> 10:46.890
DENNY:
You gotta understand,

10:46.890 --> 10:48.980
when Michael showed
up at my place,

10:48.980 --> 10:51.890
he was just another
guy from meetings.

10:51.890 --> 10:54.600
All the stuff
I’ve heard about

10:54.600 --> 10:58.890
on the news over the
past couple nights...

10:58.890 --> 11:01.890
(chuckles)
it blew my mind.

11:01.890 --> 11:03.190
I mean, you’d think
you’d know

11:03.190 --> 11:05.190
a serial killer
when you see one.

11:05.190 --> 11:07.020
What time did he arrive?

11:07.020 --> 11:08.060
Around 10:00.

11:08.060 --> 11:10.310
He was bleeding
all over the place.

11:10.310 --> 11:12.560
He said he had had
a bad time lately,

11:12.560 --> 11:13.940
so he tried to score
that night.

11:13.940 --> 11:17.940
Only the dealer he went to
tried to rip him off.

11:17.940 --> 11:19.230
Michael got angry.

11:19.230 --> 11:20.310
He shoved the guy.

11:20.310 --> 11:21.150
The guy shoved back.

11:21.150 --> 11:23.890
So he told you he was
stabbed by a dealer,

11:23.890 --> 11:25.350
and then he ran away.

11:25.350 --> 11:27.440
He said he was afraid
to go to the hospital

11:27.440 --> 11:29.890
because he thought
the dealer and his guys

11:29.890 --> 11:31.190
might come looking
for him there.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.600
So he asked you to tend
to the wound for him.

11:33.600 --> 11:37.890
And after I was done,
I let him crash on the couch.

11:37.890 --> 11:40.890
In the morning, I got up
to run some errands.

11:40.890 --> 11:41.980
He was still asleep.

11:41.980 --> 11:43.980
When I came back, he was gone.

11:43.980 --> 11:48.650
I figured, okay, he went
to work or something.

11:48.650 --> 11:50.020
But then, that night,

11:50.020 --> 11:52.190
I see on TV
somebody killed him.

11:52.190 --> 11:53.890
And then I hear
that the police

11:53.890 --> 11:55.890
think he killed
a bunch of girls.

11:55.890 --> 11:56.890
I figure, I got a record.

11:56.890 --> 11:59.100
No good’s gonna come
from me telling the cops

11:59.100 --> 12:02.560
I-I helped him,
so I keep it to myself.

12:03.730 --> 12:07.770
I swear everything
I told you is the truth.

12:08.270 --> 12:10.310
I believe you.

12:12.520 --> 12:13.890
(sighs)

12:13.890 --> 12:17.310
You said you consult
for the police.

12:17.890 --> 12:21.480
Am I gonna be in trouble
for helping him?

12:21.480 --> 12:22.890
No.

12:23.890 --> 12:26.520
Not if you help me.

12:40.650 --> 12:42.850
Sure you weren’t followed?
Positive.

12:42.850 --> 12:44.850
Did you bring
what I asked?
Yeah.

12:44.850 --> 12:46.390
There’s one spray
can of luminol.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.440
I think the surgical mask and
the shower cap are overkill.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.850
Uh, I don’t think the
fumes are gonna hurt you.

12:50.850 --> 12:52.230
It’s not for me;
it’s for you.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.100
This is the last
known location of a man

12:54.100 --> 12:55.230
you’re suspected
of murdering.

12:55.230 --> 12:56.600
If the FBI ever
finds this place,

12:56.600 --> 12:57.850
do you want
to take the chance

12:57.850 --> 13:00.350
that they’ll find
your DNA as well?

13:02.900 --> 13:03.690
I feel ridiculous.

13:03.690 --> 13:05.230
Imagine how ridiculous
you would feel

13:05.230 --> 13:08.270
if you went to prison for
a crime you didn’t commit.

13:08.270 --> 13:09.350
Okay, so on the phone,

13:09.350 --> 13:11.390
you said you found
some blood spatter?

13:11.390 --> 13:13.690
Yes. Barely noticeable.

13:13.690 --> 13:15.730
On the wall here.

13:15.730 --> 13:17.480
But what’s more noticeable

13:17.480 --> 13:21.390
is the smell of chlorine
on the floor along here.

13:21.390 --> 13:22.350
(spraying)

13:22.350 --> 13:27.350
I came here looking for clues
as to where Michael went next.

13:27.350 --> 13:28.770
But now you think he never left.

13:28.770 --> 13:30.690
The person who killed him
did it here,

13:30.690 --> 13:33.390
and then cleaned up
after they were done,

13:33.390 --> 13:35.020
but left some spatter
on the wall.

13:35.020 --> 13:38.650
Are you sure it’s not the guy
who owns the place?

13:38.650 --> 13:39.480
Positive.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.390
His haptics were an open book.

13:41.390 --> 13:42.600
He’s innocent.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.600
Get the blinds,
would you?

13:52.020 --> 13:54.390
I think we’re gonna have
to tell the FBI

13:54.390 --> 13:55.400
or the police what we found.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.390
I think that would be
a very bad idea.

13:58.390 --> 14:01.020
Obviously, these
prints were left

14:01.020 --> 14:02.940
by the killer
as she cleaned.

14:02.940 --> 14:05.100
I say "she"
because the footprints

14:05.100 --> 14:06.600
are those of a woman.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.390
What is more
troubling is...

14:08.390 --> 14:11.690
they’re the same size as yours.

14:21.890 --> 14:23.890
HOLMES: All in all,
a productive morning.

14:23.890 --> 14:25.900
We’re ahead of the FBI
on several fronts.

14:25.980 --> 14:28.810
We know when and where
Michael was murdered.

14:28.810 --> 14:31.150
And that the person
who did it was a woman.

14:31.150 --> 14:33.150
Oh, wait--
that fits their theory

14:33.150 --> 14:35.520
that I’m the killer perfectly.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.560
(cell phone chimes)

14:36.560 --> 14:37.900
So, the person
who killed Michael

14:37.900 --> 14:40.400
knew to go looking for him
at that house. How?

14:40.400 --> 14:42.020
Been wondering the same thing.

14:42.020 --> 14:44.390
What if it’s because
she had the resources

14:44.390 --> 14:46.900
of a federal agency
at her disposal?

14:46.900 --> 14:47.810
What?

14:47.810 --> 14:48.980
We’ve been puzzling as to

14:48.980 --> 14:51.100
Special Agent Mallick’s
special determination

14:51.100 --> 14:52.390
to hang Michael’s
murder on you.

14:52.390 --> 14:54.850
What if it’s because
she did it herself?

14:54.850 --> 14:57.600
The person who did it
was a woman. So is she.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.100
But why would she
track him down and kill him

15:00.100 --> 15:01.900
after he broke in here
the other night?

15:01.900 --> 15:03.190
I mean, he’d
finally slipped up,

15:03.190 --> 15:05.390
so all the Bureau had to do
was charge him.

15:05.390 --> 15:06.600
She’d have plenty of time
to build

15:06.600 --> 15:08.730
a case against him
for the murders he committed.

15:08.730 --> 15:11.390
We tried for months
to build a case, and we failed.

15:11.390 --> 15:13.480
She was finding the path
equally futile.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.390
She was worried
he would slip the net again.

15:16.390 --> 15:17.770
We’ll need
to ascertain

15:17.770 --> 15:19.690
where she was
at the time of the murder.

15:19.690 --> 15:21.440
Our friends at Everyone
were quite helpful

15:21.440 --> 15:22.600
during our pursuit of Michael,

15:22.600 --> 15:24.810
but he was a predator
of young women.

15:24.810 --> 15:27.100
Our next quarry
is a federal agent.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.480
Difficult to
tell which one

15:28.480 --> 15:30.850
a hacker collective
would find more odious.

15:30.850 --> 15:32.980
We’ll know soon enough.
I’m still wondering

15:32.980 --> 15:35.520
if we should tell the FBI
about what we found.

15:35.520 --> 15:38.440
I mean, we could go
over Mallick’s head,

15:38.440 --> 15:39.520
talk to one of her superiors.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.020
That would make it
hard for her

15:41.020 --> 15:41.810
to tamper with the scene.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.770
Actually, there’s
no scene left

15:43.770 --> 15:45.150
with which to tamper.

15:45.150 --> 15:48.100
Denny Mulgrew’s home
was destroyed by fire

15:48.100 --> 15:50.270
20 minutes ago.

15:53.060 --> 15:55.390
What do you mean,
it was "destroyed by fire"?

15:55.390 --> 15:58.100
I mean I’ve been texting
with him since we left.

15:58.100 --> 15:59.940
I explained our findings,
and I recommended

15:59.940 --> 16:02.020
that he torch the place
immediately,

16:02.020 --> 16:04.560
lest he be falsely accused
of murder.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.390
You told him
to burn down his house?

16:06.390 --> 16:07.850
I offered to send
a professional arsonist,

16:07.850 --> 16:09.980
but he assured me
he was up to the task.

16:09.980 --> 16:12.770
I’ve already sent him
a six-figure sum

16:12.770 --> 16:13.690
from an anonymous account.

16:13.690 --> 16:14.770
He’s going to be in a new

16:14.770 --> 16:16.100
and better home
before you know it.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.190
Sherlock...
He’ll even have
enough money left over

16:18.190 --> 16:19.390
to rebuild his
memorabilia collection.

16:19.390 --> 16:21.390
Sherlock...
Are you not understanding

16:21.390 --> 16:23.650
what is at stake here?

16:24.190 --> 16:26.600
You’re this close to being
charged with murder. Murder.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.940
If I’m right about
Special Agent Mallick,

16:28.940 --> 16:31.100
then it’s possible she had
plans to return to that house.

16:31.100 --> 16:33.690
Only, this time, she would have
an FBI forensics team in tow,

16:33.690 --> 16:35.940
and the place would be
brimming with evidence

16:35.940 --> 16:38.770
that she had planted
to use against you.

16:39.390 --> 16:41.400
Now, I’m sorry if you don’t
approve of my methods,

16:41.400 --> 16:45.520
but I’m not going to let
any additional harm come to you.

16:47.770 --> 16:49.890
Joan Watson is one
of the finest people

16:49.890 --> 16:50.900
I’ve ever worked with.

16:51.800 --> 16:52.900
MAN:
Is that your
full statement

16:52.970 --> 16:54.760
regarding her
character?

16:54.760 --> 16:56.090
Not even close.

16:56.090 --> 16:57.970
(chuckling):
You don’t have time

16:57.970 --> 17:00.850
to hear my full statement
about her character.

17:00.850 --> 17:03.090
But I could boil it
down to this:

17:03.090 --> 17:05.970
She didn’t kill Michael Rowan.

17:07.599 --> 17:08.800
I just wanted to see

17:08.800 --> 17:10.180
how things
were going in here.

17:10.180 --> 17:12.550
Great. I think these guys
have everything now

17:12.550 --> 17:15.220
but my belt size
and my favorite Beatle.

17:15.220 --> 17:16.849
It’s George, by the way.

17:16.849 --> 17:18.349
MALLICK: You think
we’re wasting your time?

17:18.349 --> 17:21.510
We just want the truth
to come out.

17:21.510 --> 17:22.099
So do I.

17:22.099 --> 17:23.890
Matter of fact,
I’d like to help you

17:23.890 --> 17:25.550
find the person
who killed Michael Rowan.

17:25.550 --> 17:29.260
Only, instead of being out there
developing some real suspects,

17:29.260 --> 17:30.970
I’m stuck
answering questions

17:30.970 --> 17:32.720
about the one person
in the world

17:32.720 --> 17:34.640
I know didn’t do it.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.090
You want to help.

17:36.090 --> 17:37.390
That’s funny.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.470
I came in here
because I want to help you.

17:40.470 --> 17:43.970
I understand you’re about
to join the U.S. Marshals.

17:43.970 --> 17:46.720
What’s that got to do
with anything?

17:46.720 --> 17:48.090
I’ve become
very familiar

17:48.090 --> 17:51.090
with the way Ms. Watson
and her partner like to operate.

17:51.090 --> 17:52.090
The corners they cut,

17:52.090 --> 17:55.550
the rules they pretend are there
for everyone but them.

17:55.550 --> 17:57.090
Tell me, Detective,

17:57.090 --> 18:00.090
if I were to launch
a full-scale investigation

18:00.090 --> 18:03.550
into every case you ever worked
with Ms. Watson,

18:03.550 --> 18:07.090
how do you think
that would go for you?

18:18.260 --> 18:20.010
Thanks for coming.

18:20.010 --> 18:22.090
Quite pleased to hear
from you, actually.

18:22.090 --> 18:23.100
Not everyone
at the department’s

18:23.100 --> 18:24.930
so keen to associate
with us at the moment.

18:24.930 --> 18:28.090
The captain’s got a lot
of eyes on him right now.

18:28.090 --> 18:29.640
He’s getting a
lot of questions

18:29.640 --> 18:33.090
about you and Joan,
how you work.

18:33.090 --> 18:34.680
So am I.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.470
And yet here you are.

18:38.090 --> 18:41.090
This is everything we’ve got
so far on Rowan’s murder.

18:41.090 --> 18:44.680
It isn’t much, but
maybe it’ll help.

18:46.890 --> 18:47.930
Thank you.

18:47.930 --> 18:48.720
This agent,

18:48.720 --> 18:52.090
Mallick, she’s not
going to stop coming.

18:52.090 --> 18:55.640
She’s gonna do whatever it
takes to hang this on Joan.

18:55.640 --> 18:56.890
I know.

18:56.890 --> 18:57.890
Well, I would tell you

18:57.890 --> 19:01.090
to solve this one
fast, but you’re you.

19:01.090 --> 19:03.090
I know you’ve only
got one speed.

19:03.090 --> 19:06.100
Oh, you’d be surprised.

19:20.600 --> 19:25.640
(over stereo):
♪ So, baby, let me, let me ♪
(bees buzzing)

19:25.640 --> 19:27.600
♪ Totally relax you ♪

19:27.600 --> 19:29.090
♪It’s only love♪

19:29.090 --> 19:31.260
♪ To where you feel
that you’re... ♪

19:31.260 --> 19:32.140
(music stops)

19:32.140 --> 19:34.090
Something I should know?

19:34.090 --> 19:35.850
Everyone got back to us
while you were out.

19:35.850 --> 19:37.600
They said they would look
into Agent Mallick

19:37.600 --> 19:40.890
if I gave them an up-close view
of one of your beehives

19:40.890 --> 19:42.090
and put this song on repeat.

19:42.090 --> 19:44.760
I mean, I had
to get movers

19:44.760 --> 19:47.090
to get it down here,
but at least we did not

19:47.090 --> 19:48.640
have to humiliate ourselves
this time.

19:48.640 --> 19:49.890
Oh, you’ve been humiliated.

19:49.890 --> 19:52.090
You just don’t realize it.

19:52.430 --> 19:54.470
One of the founding fathers
of Everyone,

19:54.470 --> 19:59.600
StingSquat44, is an
admitted melissophiliac.

20:00.090 --> 20:01.180
He’s aroused by bees.

20:01.180 --> 20:06.100
You just arranged a sex show
with a cast of thousands.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.090
Ordinarily,
I would shut it down,

20:10.090 --> 20:12.760
but since we need
Everyone’s help so badly...

20:12.760 --> 20:15.010
Actually, I’m not sure we do.

20:15.010 --> 20:18.300
My meeting with Marcus
was quite fruitful.

20:18.300 --> 20:22.300
Every piece of trash
on or around Michael’s body

20:22.300 --> 20:24.350
was vouchered as evidence
and indexed.

20:24.350 --> 20:25.550
Standard procedure when a body

20:25.550 --> 20:27.680
turns up in a landfill
or a dump.

20:27.680 --> 20:28.600
According to that,

20:28.600 --> 20:31.220
everything around Michael
originated in Harlem.

20:31.220 --> 20:33.090
Doesn’t make any sense.
You and I both know

20:33.090 --> 20:34.970
that Michael
was killed in Queens.

20:34.970 --> 20:35.470
So you think

20:35.470 --> 20:37.930
the real killer
murdered Michael in Queens,

20:37.930 --> 20:39.430
and then dumped him in Harlem.

20:39.430 --> 20:41.180
That’s one possibility.
Another is that

20:41.180 --> 20:44.300
Michael’s body never went
to Harlem at all.

20:45.350 --> 20:48.550
Harlem came to him.

20:52.430 --> 20:55.090
HOLMES:
Curtis Jenkins?

20:56.430 --> 20:57.850
Hello.
My name’s Sherlock Holmes.

20:57.850 --> 21:00.300
This is Joan Watson.
We work with the police.

21:00.300 --> 21:03.050
How you doing?
Good.

21:03.050 --> 21:05.100
Actually,
I know your son, Graham.

21:05.100 --> 21:07.430
He was in prison
for strangling his wife.

21:07.430 --> 21:09.640
I helped prove
that he was innocent.

21:09.640 --> 21:11.090
Perhaps he
mentioned me.

21:11.090 --> 21:15.430
He said something about
a British guy with a funny name.

21:15.430 --> 21:18.720
You come here so I could
thank you in person?

21:18.720 --> 21:20.430
No. We came here
because we think

21:20.430 --> 21:23.050
that you helped the woman
who killed Michael Rowan

21:23.050 --> 21:25.090
dispose of his body.

21:25.090 --> 21:26.470
You know the name.

21:26.470 --> 21:27.260
Course I do.

21:27.260 --> 21:28.600
He’s the son of a bitch

21:28.600 --> 21:30.760
the police think
killed my daughter-in-law.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.720
Heard on the news
he turned up dead.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.390
I was okay with that.

21:35.390 --> 21:37.470
But I had nothing
to do with it.

21:37.470 --> 21:40.720
So, you’ve worked as a mechanic
for the Department of Sanitation

21:40.720 --> 21:41.720
for over 30 years.

21:41.720 --> 21:45.430
You’ve spent the last 15
here at the Harlem garage.

21:45.430 --> 21:46.180
So?

21:46.180 --> 21:47.720
So, Michael’s body was found

21:47.720 --> 21:49.090
at a DSNY transfer station.

21:49.090 --> 21:51.090
We have evidence
that he was dumped

21:51.090 --> 21:53.390
by a garbage truck
that works out of Harlem.

21:53.390 --> 21:54.390
We also have evidence

21:54.390 --> 21:56.760
that he was killed
at a residence in Queens.

21:56.760 --> 21:57.970
HOLMES: We think
you took a truck

21:57.970 --> 21:59.680
from this garage,
drove it to Queens,

21:59.680 --> 22:02.430
picked up Michael’s body,
and then returned it,

22:02.430 --> 22:04.300
where it resumed
its usual rounds in Harlem,

22:04.300 --> 22:08.140
before making a final stop
at the transfer station.

22:08.140 --> 22:09.220
(chuckling)

22:09.220 --> 22:10.680
When you got here,

22:10.680 --> 22:14.390
you noticed the guard station
at the gate, right?

22:14.390 --> 22:18.090
That place is
manned 24-7.

22:18.090 --> 22:19.180
These trucks may smell,

22:19.180 --> 22:22.090
but they cost
about 150 grand apiece.

22:22.090 --> 22:24.760
And the only people
who can take ’em out

22:24.760 --> 22:25.850
are the drivers.

22:25.850 --> 22:27.220
Well, you have
friends here.

22:27.220 --> 22:29.090
Maybe you called in
a favor.

22:29.090 --> 22:30.260
Even if I had,

22:30.260 --> 22:32.180
all the trucks
are tracked by GPS.

22:32.180 --> 22:35.850
So you find one that took a trip
to Queens the other day,

22:35.850 --> 22:36.970
you let me know.

22:36.970 --> 22:37.850
Mr. Jenkins...

22:37.850 --> 22:41.550
The person who killed
that psycho is a hero.

22:41.550 --> 22:42.140
Okay?

22:42.140 --> 22:44.090
Rowan put my son
through hell.

22:44.090 --> 22:47.260
So, even if I could point
you in someone’s direction,

22:47.260 --> 22:48.800
I wouldn’t.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.050
Not in a million years.

22:50.050 --> 22:53.300
Well, perhaps you just need
a little motivation.
Don’t.

22:54.930 --> 22:56.850
Come on.

22:58.550 --> 23:01.100
HOLMES:You understand
that man’s our best chance

23:01.100 --> 23:02.090
of proving your innocence.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.300
I’m not sure
that’s true.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.140
He seemed pretty confident
that we couldn’t prove

23:05.140 --> 23:07.930
that he drove a truck
out of here, right?

23:07.930 --> 23:08.550
He did.

23:08.550 --> 23:10.090
Maybe that’s because
he put the body

23:10.090 --> 23:11.550
in the truck here
at the garage.

23:11.550 --> 23:14.470
You think he and/or the killer
brought Michael here,

23:14.470 --> 23:16.850
brought the body to the truck,
not the other way around?

23:16.850 --> 23:19.090
That guard station he
mentioned-- I noticed it.

23:19.090 --> 23:20.470
I also noticed the
security camera

23:20.470 --> 23:22.390
that was recording
vehicles coming and going.

23:22.390 --> 23:25.090
If the woman who killed
Michael was here that day...

23:25.090 --> 23:26.720
Camera might have
caught her face.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.090
MAN:Sorry. I can’t help you.

23:28.090 --> 23:31.260
The footage
you’re looking for is gone.

23:31.260 --> 23:32.300
What do you mean, "gone"?

23:32.300 --> 23:34.090
I mean someone
came and took it.

23:34.090 --> 23:36.090
They were law
enforcement, like you.

23:36.090 --> 23:37.430
See, I wasn’t here,

23:37.430 --> 23:39.890
but they told my guys
there was some anonymous tip

23:39.890 --> 23:41.300
that somebody
was stealing equipment.

23:41.300 --> 23:44.090
We let ’em into the system.
They took what they needed.

23:44.090 --> 23:47.090
The original footage
got erased by accident.

23:47.090 --> 23:48.090
Course it did.

23:48.090 --> 23:49.180
But the person
that came here--

23:49.180 --> 23:53.050
was she from the FBI,
an agent called Mallick?

23:53.050 --> 23:54.470
I... Louie.

23:54.470 --> 23:57.850
The person you let into
the system the other day--

23:57.850 --> 23:59.510
was she a Fed
named Mallick?

23:59.510 --> 24:00.970
No, it was a cop.

24:00.970 --> 24:02.140
And it was a he.

24:02.140 --> 24:04.390
His name was, uh, Grayson.

24:04.390 --> 24:06.090
No, Gregson.

24:06.090 --> 24:07.510
Tom Gregson.

24:07.510 --> 24:10.640
He was a captain.
Does that help?

24:17.880 --> 24:19.500
No, I’m fine.

24:19.500 --> 24:20.630
You deserve a night out.

24:20.630 --> 24:23.340
I’ll get a pizza or something.

24:23.340 --> 24:25.790
All right? Okay.

24:25.790 --> 24:28.090
Love you, too.

24:33.790 --> 24:36.000
♪ ♪

24:52.000 --> 24:53.100
HOLMES:
So you lied to the people

24:53.160 --> 24:55.990
at the garage
in Harlem.

24:56.450 --> 24:59.580
You didn’t make a copy
of the footage.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.080
No.

25:10.990 --> 25:12.830
There’s no copy.

25:17.990 --> 25:20.450
How much do you know?

25:23.500 --> 25:26.080
Almost all of it.

25:26.500 --> 25:27.830
Michael was
killed by a woman

25:27.830 --> 25:31.990
at the home of a man
named Denny Mulgrew.

25:31.990 --> 25:36.660
An accomplice helped her
dispose of the body:

25:36.660 --> 25:41.250
a man named Curtis Jenkins,
father of Graham.

25:41.250 --> 25:44.660
I confess I don’t
know at what point

25:44.660 --> 25:46.580
you were drawn
into the plot,

25:46.580 --> 25:49.450
but once you were,
you realized that the killer

25:49.450 --> 25:52.160
could be undone
by security footage

25:52.160 --> 25:54.500
recorded outside
Mr. Jenkins’ workplace,

25:54.500 --> 25:58.080
so you went there
and you destroyed it.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.370
I spent the better part of today

26:02.370 --> 26:07.990
thinking that Michael’s killer
was Special Agent Mallick.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.950
But no.

26:11.950 --> 26:14.620
It’s Hannah.

26:14.620 --> 26:16.990
Your daughter.

26:18.790 --> 26:22.990
Maddie wasn’t just
Hannah’s roommate.

26:22.990 --> 26:25.620
She was her best friend.

26:25.620 --> 26:27.990
After Maddie’s murder,

26:27.990 --> 26:29.990
Hannah took
some time off.

26:29.990 --> 26:33.120
She was supposed to be
getting her head together.

26:33.120 --> 26:39.540
Instead, she started looking
into Rowan on her own.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.330
She dug in.

26:41.330 --> 26:44.910
She got to know
all the people in his life.

26:44.910 --> 26:45.990
Including Denny Mulgrew.

26:45.990 --> 26:50.080
After she heard about
what happened at your place,

26:50.080 --> 26:52.120
she got to thinking.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.990
He’s not going to a hospital.

26:53.990 --> 26:57.120
He’d go to a guy like Mulgrew.

26:57.120 --> 26:59.080
So she played a hunch.

26:59.080 --> 27:02.500
She went to his place
and staked it out.

27:02.500 --> 27:06.120
The next morning,
after Mulgrew left,

27:06.120 --> 27:08.410
she found a way inside.

27:08.990 --> 27:11.080
She had her gun with her.

27:11.080 --> 27:13.990
But she thought
that was too good for him,

27:13.990 --> 27:17.330
so she used her baton instead.

27:17.890 --> 27:19.890
Him calling Joan’s name--

27:19.890 --> 27:21.770
she never heard that.

27:21.770 --> 27:23.850
And she sure as hell didn’t know

27:23.850 --> 27:26.690
the whole thing
was being recorded.

27:26.890 --> 27:31.020
So, when did she make you
an accessory?

27:32.440 --> 27:34.190
Couple hours later, I got a call

27:34.190 --> 27:37.020
from a friend of mine
who owns a bar.

27:37.020 --> 27:39.690
He said Hannah was there

27:39.690 --> 27:42.690
and that she was in bad shape.

27:42.690 --> 27:47.690
So I went there,
got her into my car.

27:48.400 --> 27:52.230
And that’s when she told me
everything.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.900
You have to tell the FBI.

27:58.900 --> 28:01.520
I can’t.

28:01.520 --> 28:02.890
No.

28:02.890 --> 28:04.060
Hannah’s a cop.

28:04.060 --> 28:06.310
She can’t go to prison.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.560
And Watson can?

28:08.560 --> 28:10.020
You gotta understand--

28:10.020 --> 28:12.980
everything I did,
I did before I knew

28:12.980 --> 28:15.690
that the Feds were trying
to pin this on Joan.

28:15.690 --> 28:18.560
Are you under the impression
that that makes it okay?

28:18.560 --> 28:19.890
Mallick’s got nothing.

28:19.890 --> 28:21.690
Her whole case
is circumstantial.

28:21.690 --> 28:23.020
It’s going to blow over.

28:23.020 --> 28:25.020
Let’s just imagine

28:25.020 --> 28:27.060
for a moment that it does.

28:27.060 --> 28:30.060
What about the damage
to Watson’s reputation?

28:30.060 --> 28:32.100
Do you think
she’ll ever be able

28:32.100 --> 28:34.560
to consult for law
enforcement ever again?

28:34.560 --> 28:36.150
What about the families
of the women

28:36.150 --> 28:37.900
who Michael murdered
and then disposed of?

28:37.900 --> 28:39.400
What about the mothers
and fathers

28:39.400 --> 28:41.310
who are never going to be
able to find their daughters,

28:41.310 --> 28:43.890
never going to be able
to give them proper burials?

28:43.890 --> 28:46.770
Is this gonna blow over
for them as well?

28:46.770 --> 28:48.060
Or do you think

28:48.060 --> 28:49.890
perhaps they might start
bringing

28:49.890 --> 28:50.900
civil lawsuits against Watson?

28:51.050 --> 28:53.220
How exactly do you imagine

28:53.220 --> 28:55.100
her quality of life
moving forward?

28:55.100 --> 28:57.760
You’re the door
that this lunatic

28:57.760 --> 28:59.300
walked through, okay?

28:59.300 --> 29:00.430
Not me!

29:00.430 --> 29:02.350
He cozied up to you.

29:02.350 --> 29:05.090
He got to know everything
about you,

29:05.090 --> 29:08.090
including the fact
that I have a daughter.

29:08.090 --> 29:10.050
He killed her friend

29:10.050 --> 29:11.720
to get your attention.

29:11.720 --> 29:13.090
If it weren’t for you,

29:13.090 --> 29:15.090
Maddie Williams
would be alive today

29:15.090 --> 29:18.470
and my little girl
wouldn’t be a killer.

29:22.090 --> 29:24.640
She’s my daughter.

29:27.090 --> 29:29.800
She’s my best friend.

29:34.010 --> 29:36.600
(door opens)

29:41.010 --> 29:42.220
He won’t help.

29:42.220 --> 29:43.430
I think it’s time

29:43.430 --> 29:45.760
we took everything we know
to Agent Mallick.

29:45.760 --> 29:49.010
There’s very little we
can prove, obviously,

29:49.010 --> 29:49.970
but our story holds.

29:49.970 --> 29:51.090
And if she’s half the agent

29:51.090 --> 29:52.850
she claims to be,
she’ll at least bring

29:52.850 --> 29:54.640
some pressure to bear
on Hannah Gregson.

29:54.640 --> 29:56.850
That might be all that it takes.

29:57.100 --> 29:58.850
It’s funny--
the FBI came and took

29:58.850 --> 30:01.010
everything we ever
put up on that wall,

30:01.010 --> 30:02.510
but I still see it.

30:02.510 --> 30:06.090
The reports, maps,
crime scene photos,

30:06.090 --> 30:09.970
the face of every woman
he killed.

30:09.970 --> 30:12.100
I remember everything.

30:12.100 --> 30:14.510
As I was saying,
I think a conversation

30:14.510 --> 30:16.140
with Agent Mallick is in order.

30:16.140 --> 30:18.260
What if we didn’t do anything?

30:18.260 --> 30:20.600
Just took our chances,
see what happens?

30:20.600 --> 30:24.510
You want to just wait and see
if you’re arrested?

30:24.510 --> 30:27.800
I-I understand why Hannah
did what she did.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.600
I don’t want her
to go to prison for it.

30:29.600 --> 30:32.220
I don’t want the captain
to go to prison for helping her.

30:32.220 --> 30:34.760
But think about it--
what does Mallick really have?

30:34.760 --> 30:36.390
Means:
Uh, Michael was bludgeoned

30:36.390 --> 30:38.470
with a weapon
that you’re known to favor.

30:38.470 --> 30:39.800
Motive:
He tried to kill you.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.180
Opportunity:
No one reliable can account

30:41.180 --> 30:43.260
for your whereabouts
at the time of the murder.

30:43.260 --> 30:45.180
What else am I forgetting?
Uh, oh, yes.

30:45.180 --> 30:48.050
He identified you as his killer
as he lay dying.

30:48.050 --> 30:49.800
Mallick does not have
a murder weapon.

30:49.800 --> 30:50.760
She has no witness.

30:50.760 --> 30:53.850
She can’t prove that
I wasn’t where I said I was

30:53.850 --> 30:56.090
when Michael was killed.

30:56.510 --> 30:59.260
You appreciate that the captain
is trying to be a good parent.

30:59.260 --> 31:00.800
I assume that’s because
you’ve been

31:00.800 --> 31:02.180
trying to become
a parent yourself.

31:02.180 --> 31:03.680
How do you think all of this

31:03.680 --> 31:05.050
is going to affect
that endeavor?

31:05.050 --> 31:07.180
Who in their right mind
is going to allow

31:07.180 --> 31:10.180
an accused killer
to adopt a child?

31:10.970 --> 31:12.800
Maybe no one.

31:13.090 --> 31:16.930
Can’t think about that
right now.

31:17.390 --> 31:19.100
Well, then it’s over, you know.

31:19.100 --> 31:21.430
You know, our little
family unit.

31:21.430 --> 31:23.760
You, me, the captain, Marcus.

31:23.760 --> 31:24.680
We’ll never be able

31:24.680 --> 31:27.600
to set foot
in that precinct ever again.

31:28.350 --> 31:30.470
I know.

31:30.930 --> 31:33.090
We’re supposed to be partners!

31:33.090 --> 31:34.890
We are.

31:36.140 --> 31:38.800
So be my partner.

31:57.000 --> 32:01.710
Been thinking about you
and the decision you made.

32:02.670 --> 32:07.790
I think there are certain crimes
which the law cannot touch

32:07.790 --> 32:10.840
and which therefore,
to some extent,

32:10.840 --> 32:13.920
justify private revenge.

32:14.790 --> 32:19.090
But your revenge has been
anything but private.

32:19.090 --> 32:21.880
It’s also been assigned
to the wrong person.

32:21.880 --> 32:24.050
I told you when
you called--

32:24.050 --> 32:27.590
I never meant for any of
this to come down on Joan.

32:27.590 --> 32:31.790
She doesn’t think we should
tell the FBI the truth.

32:31.790 --> 32:35.340
Despite his betrayal, she still
cares about your father.

32:35.340 --> 32:37.090
She doesn’t want
to see him

32:37.090 --> 32:39.800
suffer the consequences
of your actions.

32:39.800 --> 32:43.500
She would rather
take her chances.

32:44.960 --> 32:47.670
And what do you think?

32:48.300 --> 32:52.790
I think a good detective
leaves nothing to chance.

32:54.750 --> 32:58.550
You’re going to confess
to everything.

33:00.460 --> 33:04.790
You can start with how you
disposed of the murder weapon.

33:06.880 --> 33:08.790
(doorbell rings)

33:14.090 --> 33:15.000
Ma’am.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.170
There’s been a
development.

33:16.170 --> 33:19.210
We need you to
come with us.

33:19.210 --> 33:23.210
(door opens and closes)

33:24.960 --> 33:26.920
This is for
you to sign.

33:26.920 --> 33:28.210
What is that?
An affidavit

33:28.210 --> 33:30.790
that’ll keep you from being
charged as an accessory

33:30.790 --> 33:33.050
to Michael Rowan’s murder
after the fact.

33:33.050 --> 33:35.790
"Accessory"?

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
He didn’t tell you
what he did, did he?

33:40.000 --> 33:41.090
Who?

33:41.090 --> 33:42.460
Your partner.

33:42.460 --> 33:45.460
He confessed to the murder.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.790
He even produced
the murder weapon.

33:47.790 --> 33:50.460
It was covered
in Rowan’s blood

33:50.460 --> 33:51.790
and his fingerprints.

33:51.790 --> 33:53.880
You’re off the hook.

33:54.880 --> 33:55.790
No.

33:55.790 --> 33:59.300
That’s wrong.
Sherlock did not kill anyone.

33:59.300 --> 34:00.550
I believe you.

34:00.550 --> 34:02.920
I think he’s covering for you.

34:04.550 --> 34:06.130
I need to speak with him.

34:06.130 --> 34:07.500
Good luck with that.

34:07.500 --> 34:08.300
I have to see him.

34:08.300 --> 34:10.500
He’s not here.
He’s in England.

34:10.500 --> 34:11.090
What?

34:11.090 --> 34:12.790
He didn’t confess
in person.

34:12.790 --> 34:13.590
He sent a proxy.

34:13.590 --> 34:14.840
Someone from
the British consulate.

34:14.840 --> 34:17.090
After she gave us
his confession,

34:17.090 --> 34:18.790
she said some deal
got hammered out

34:18.790 --> 34:20.130
between our country and hers.

34:20.130 --> 34:22.050
MI6 made up a
story for him,

34:22.050 --> 34:24.170
said that when
he killed Rowan

34:24.170 --> 34:26.790
he was acting in the
service of the queen.

34:26.790 --> 34:31.500
But you and I know
that’s a load of crap.

34:32.090 --> 34:33.790
You said he’s in England.

34:33.790 --> 34:35.420
The only part of
the deal I like.

34:35.420 --> 34:39.340
Sherlock Holmes isn’t
America’s problem anymore.

34:39.340 --> 34:40.130
What do you mean?

34:40.130 --> 34:41.500
The Brits won’t
extradite him.

34:41.500 --> 34:42.550
They made that
very clear.

34:42.550 --> 34:44.590
And he isn’t allowed
to set foot

34:44.590 --> 34:46.170
in the U.S. ever again.

34:46.170 --> 34:48.250
Not without
being arrested and tried

34:48.250 --> 34:51.710
for everything he
alleges he did.

34:52.460 --> 34:56.880
Your little partnership--
it’s over.

34:57.790 --> 34:59.250
Cheer up, Joan.

34:59.250 --> 35:02.300
You just got away with murder.

35:03.090 --> 35:06.750
(door opens and closes)

35:17.750 --> 35:20.460
Thought you were supposed
to be in England.

35:20.460 --> 35:22.300
I am.

35:22.300 --> 35:24.710
Supposed to be, that is.

35:24.710 --> 35:27.170
The terms of the
deal I agreed to

35:27.170 --> 35:29.380
are quite binding.

35:29.380 --> 35:32.840
There’s a plane waiting
for me at Kennedy.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.210
But...

35:35.210 --> 35:38.710
couldn’t leave without
saying good-bye.

35:43.550 --> 35:45.550
You surprised me last night.

35:45.550 --> 35:48.710
Your... your willingness
to protect the captain.

35:48.710 --> 35:52.710
Then I was surprised
that I was surprised.

35:53.790 --> 35:58.300
Helping others before yourself
is your nature.

35:58.920 --> 36:01.420
Always has been.

36:02.590 --> 36:06.340
And yet, in this instance,
I found the risk to you

36:06.340 --> 36:07.420
unacceptable.

36:07.420 --> 36:09.670
You thought I was
throwing my life away,

36:09.670 --> 36:11.960
so you decided to throw
your life away instead.

36:11.960 --> 36:16.130
Well, in point of fact,
I’ve sacrificed very little.

36:16.130 --> 36:19.250
With respect to my freedom,
that is.

36:19.250 --> 36:20.880
MI6 owed me.

36:20.880 --> 36:24.670
Not you, not the captain,
certainly not his daughter.

36:24.670 --> 36:25.420
Me.

36:25.420 --> 36:29.300
I’m the only one who could
confess without going to prison.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.050
I wasn’t going to confess.

36:31.050 --> 36:33.790
No, you were going
to play this out.

36:33.790 --> 36:35.300
Hope for the best.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.250
You visited Agent
Mallick this morning.

36:37.250 --> 36:39.790
How did you think it was
going to turn out for you?

36:39.790 --> 36:41.790
She told me that you gave her
the murder weapon.

36:41.790 --> 36:43.840
I visited Hannah
Gregson this morning.

36:43.840 --> 36:46.790
I told her my intentions,
and she agreed to help.

36:46.790 --> 36:49.710
She told me where the
weapon was, and I retrieved it.

36:49.710 --> 36:52.300
We could have fought this
together.

36:52.300 --> 36:53.090
We could have failed.

36:53.090 --> 36:55.590
That doesn’t sound like us.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.050
I wanted to thank you.

36:58.050 --> 36:59.460
Don’t.
I wanted to
thank you

36:59.460 --> 37:01.090
for everything
you’ve done for me

37:01.090 --> 37:02.790
over the last six years.

37:02.790 --> 37:03.790
Sherlock...

37:03.790 --> 37:06.790
I was dying when we first met.

37:08.420 --> 37:09.800
I mean, I looked well enough.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.960
Just got out of rehab
and all that.

37:15.250 --> 37:18.800
Thought that I knew everything,
but I didn’t.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.460
I didn’t realize how much...
how much work

37:21.460 --> 37:26.300
I would have to put in
and how much time it would take.

37:26.300 --> 37:31.790
But most of all,
I-I didn’t realize that...

37:31.790 --> 37:34.790
things could get better.

37:35.460 --> 37:38.790
And that I could actually be...

37:46.170 --> 37:48.840
Yes, I was dying.

37:50.460 --> 37:53.840
And no one could see it but you.

37:58.090 --> 38:00.790
You saved my life, Joan.

38:10.790 --> 38:13.340
We’re partners.

38:14.050 --> 38:15.920
No.

38:15.920 --> 38:18.960
We’re much better than that.

38:22.050 --> 38:25.750
We’re two people
that love each other.

38:28.380 --> 38:31.000
We always have been.

38:48.340 --> 38:50.790
(door closes)

38:55.250 --> 38:57.790
MAN:
It’s a most painful
matter to me,

38:57.790 --> 38:59.750
as you can most readily
imagine, Mr. Holmes.

38:59.750 --> 39:01.920
I’ve been cut
to the quick.

39:01.920 --> 39:04.170
I understand from
our mutual acquaintance,

39:04.170 --> 39:05.790
Stamford, that you’ve
already managed

39:05.790 --> 39:07.670
several delicate cases
of this sort,

39:07.670 --> 39:10.000
though I presume
that they were hardly

39:10.000 --> 39:11.790
from the same class
of society.

39:11.790 --> 39:14.960
Actually,
this would be a step down.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.790
I beg pardon?

39:16.920 --> 39:20.300
My last client of the sort
was a king.

39:20.300 --> 39:21.840
Oh.

39:21.840 --> 39:23.590
I had no idea.

39:23.590 --> 39:25.630
Had his wife gone missing?

39:25.630 --> 39:27.800
Sorry.
Do-do... do you hear that?

39:27.800 --> 39:29.420
Hear what?

39:29.420 --> 39:30.840
Racket next door.

39:30.840 --> 39:34.340
I’m sorry, Mr. Holmes.
I hear nothing.

39:34.790 --> 39:36.380
Forgive me, Lord St. Simon.
I’m-I’m...

39:36.380 --> 39:39.130
I’m just... I’m still
getting used to this place.

39:39.130 --> 39:39.800
Oh, really?

39:39.800 --> 39:40.960
Stamford told me
that you returned

39:40.960 --> 39:42.300
to Baker Street
almost six months ago.

39:42.300 --> 39:45.000
I did, but my-my residence
in New York

39:45.000 --> 39:46.500
had much thicker walls.

39:46.500 --> 39:49.790
And, uh, these are just taking
some getting used to.
