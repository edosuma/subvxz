00:28.800 --> 00:32.040
Finn, I'm going to the auction
at the yacht club now.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.680
Are you sure you won't come?

00:34.760 --> 00:35.960
FINN: Positive.

00:37.840 --> 00:39.920
Fine. I'll see you later.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.440
(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

00:56.840 --> 00:58.640
(BAND PLAYS TRADITIONAL MUSIC)

01:07.400 --> 01:10.480
The dance represents
an offering to Baron Lev.

01:10.560 --> 01:12.200
Who is this Baron fella?

01:12.280 --> 01:15.240
FLORENCE: He's the master
of the dead during Fete Marie.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.200
Sir, that's Baron Lev
over there.

01:18.280 --> 01:21.440
-JACK: Oh, right.
-JP: The infamous top hat
and skull face.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.360
-(FLORENCE LAUGHS)
-Fantastic.

01:24.440 --> 01:26.320
-Dwayne! Everything okay?
-Oh!

01:26.400 --> 01:28.600
-You look haunted.
-It's Darlene.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.800
She's got her niece staying
with her for the whole week.

01:30.880 --> 01:32.240
This is a bad thing?

01:32.320 --> 01:33.600
You haven't met her, Chief.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.560
Uncle Dwayne, can I have
a coconut ice?

01:36.640 --> 01:39.280
How could I possibly
say no to you, Elize?

01:39.360 --> 01:43.240
And after, can we join
the parade, please,
Uncle Dwayne?

01:43.320 --> 01:45.320
Of course we can.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.600
I don't suppose
you've seen Dwayne?

01:49.680 --> 01:51.160
-That way.
-Ah.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.600
There you go, sir.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.720
So tell me more about
this Baron Lev.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.560
Is he somebody I should be
scared of?

01:57.640 --> 01:59.920
Oh, I'd say so, sir.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.840
On Fete Marie, it's claimed
he returns to the living world

02:02.920 --> 02:04.400
in search of a companion

02:04.480 --> 02:06.320
to join him in the afterlife.

02:06.680 --> 02:07.640
Ooh.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.000
-Trevor, hello.
-Hi.

02:19.080 --> 02:21.760
Selwyn, old boy,
so pleased you could make it.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.680
Delighted to be here, Hugh.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.280
Always happy to support
local charities.

02:26.360 --> 02:29.400
Oh, indeed. I really
must get you aboard
the boat this year.

02:29.480 --> 02:32.880
Don't worry, we won't do
anything so vulgar
as sailing it.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.400
Ah, let me get you a drink.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.920
Rum comme d'habitude for our
noble officer of the law.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
-Please, Antoine.
-I'm so glad you could make it.

02:41.280 --> 02:42.720
Ah, Catherine.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.600
-Charlotte!
-Lovely to see you.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.720
Thank you for inviting me.

02:47.720 --> 02:48.880
I feel honoured to be here.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.800
Oh, nonsense, we are
the honoured ones.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.000
Having the Mayor herself
to host our auction.

02:53.080 --> 02:54.760
I just hope I raise
enough money.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.400
Oh, we have no worries there.
We're a generous lot
at the yacht club.

02:57.480 --> 02:58.480
(CHUCKLES)

02:58.560 --> 03:00.800
Oh, Hugh, sweetie.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.400
Have you seen Daisy?
She and Finn really ought
to be here by now.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.120
Not seen hide nor hair
of her since this morning.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.480
-Hmm.
-Hi, Catherine.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.360
Let's go and look
at the prizes.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.040
(TRADITIONAL DANCE
MUSIC PLAYING)

03:34.920 --> 03:37.160
So, Dwayne,
what happened to Elize?

03:37.240 --> 03:38.360
(CHUCKLES)

03:38.440 --> 03:40.480
Darlene's taken her
home for dinner.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.040
Thank goodness.

03:45.680 --> 03:50.960
You know, sometimes
I don't really think
I've earned my evening beer.

03:51.040 --> 03:53.320
But this one? (CHUCKLES)

03:53.400 --> 03:55.560
-Most definitely.
-Excuse me.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.480
-You're the police, right?
-Can we help you at all?

03:58.560 --> 04:00.960
It is my wife.
I think she's been murdered.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.200
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

04:42.960 --> 04:44.840
I saw a message had been
left on my answerphone.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.560
So I played it.

04:47.440 --> 04:48.480
It was Daisy, and...

04:49.680 --> 04:51.280
Something's happened to her.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.600
Something awful.

DAISY: What are you doing?

05:03.480 --> 05:05.440
Put the knife down.

05:05.520 --> 05:06.720
Please put it down!

05:06.800 --> 05:08.080
Get off me!

No!

05:11.160 --> 05:13.360
(SCREAMS)

05:15.080 --> 05:16.800
How could someone
do that to her?

05:16.880 --> 05:19.800
Well, we don't know anything
for certain yet.

05:19.880 --> 05:22.800
Do you have any idea
where Daisy was supposed
to be this afternoon?

05:22.880 --> 05:24.280
At the yacht club.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.720
She's a member.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.600
There was some charity
event on there.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.320
And so when was the last time
you saw her?

05:30.080 --> 05:31.040
Just after 4:00.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.920
That's when she left
for the club.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.840
And apart from this message
left at 4:57 p.m.,
did you hear from her

05:37.920 --> 05:39.400
or see her after that?

05:39.480 --> 05:43.160
No, I... I assumed she was at
the club house enjoying herself.

05:43.240 --> 05:46.040
Right. If Mrs Anderson
was last seen heading
for the yacht club,

05:46.120 --> 05:47.800
then we start the search there.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.360
Dwayne, JP.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.000
Finn, I want you to wait here
until we have some news.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.400
DS Cassell will stay with you
and look after you, okay?

06:18.360 --> 06:21.200

06:21.280 --> 06:22.560

-CATHERINE: Sold!
-I know her.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.920
We believe someone
attacked her with a knife.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.920
Selwyn, what's going on?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.760
It's Daisy.

06:55.840 --> 06:59.000
We are concerned something
may have happened to her, but...

06:59.080 --> 07:01.560
As far as we're aware,
she didn't make it
to the auction.

07:01.640 --> 07:05.240
No. Although I am sure
someone said they saw her car
parked out at the front.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.640
Of course, it's locked.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.520
SELWYN: And if her car's here,
in theory she must be as well.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.400
Okay, let's search the place.
Dwayne, JP, you take inside.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.000
Commissioner, if you
wouldn't mind pitching
in with the troops,

07:21.080 --> 07:22.280
perhaps we could
search the grounds.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.240
Glad to be of help, Inspector.

07:45.080 --> 07:46.360
Inspector!

Oh, I see.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.320
I'll let him know.

I'm really sorry.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.440
(SOBBING)

08:33.560 --> 08:35.760
Don't need a post-mortem
to tell that she was stabbed.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.000
A single stroke
to the chest.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.840
One-and-a-half inch blade,
by the looks of things,
non-serrated.

08:44.960 --> 08:48.480
Defensive wounds
to her forearms.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.760
It suggests she put up
some sort of a fight.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.920
Poor girl.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.760
Make-up, car keys,
mobile phone.

08:58.560 --> 09:01.360
Last call was made
this afternoon to Finn.

09:01.880 --> 09:03.920
4:57?

09:04.000 --> 09:07.160
Yeah. Tallies with the message
left on his answerphone.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.680
We were all inside
taking part in the auction then.

09:11.400 --> 09:14.320
So if she did scream for help,
that's why nobody heard her.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.000
And she probably reached
for her phone in desperation.

09:18.360 --> 09:19.480
(SIGHS)

09:20.480 --> 09:22.000
This little posy...

09:22.080 --> 09:25.040
I saw others wearing it
at the carnival.
Is it a Fete Marie thing?

09:25.120 --> 09:27.640
It's from a plant
called jatropha.

09:27.720 --> 09:30.080
It's meant to ward off
evil beings.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.440
(SIGHS)

09:32.520 --> 09:35.120
Hang on. There's something
wedged behind the flowers.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.880
-A butterfly.
-May I?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.200
I'm something
of a lepidopterist.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.920
Uh, butterflies.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.880
A hobby of mine
since childhood.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.960
-Oh.
-It's a pieridae.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.440
A yellow passion.
But it shouldn't be here.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.240
-What do you mean, sir?
-I mean, it shouldn't
be anywhere.

09:58.320 --> 10:01.880
The yellow passion
emerges from the chrysalis
in early summer.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.000
It lives for about
six weeks.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.160
It would have died
six months ago.

10:06.240 --> 10:09.160
Well, then, why was it lodged
in the victim's clothing?

10:20.320 --> 10:21.520
SELWYN: Inspector.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.720
This is Hugh Davenport.

10:23.800 --> 10:24.920
Hello.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.560
Chairman here
at the yacht club.

10:27.640 --> 10:32.360
And this is Charlotte Hamilton,
club secretary and treasurer.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.360
Please, don't worry.
I'm going to try and keep
this as brief as possible.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.680
Finn, could I trouble
you to go over

10:38.760 --> 10:40.800
Mrs Anderson's movements
this afternoon?

10:40.880 --> 10:41.960
Just one more time.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.440
Okay. Um...

10:44.520 --> 10:46.760
Daisy got back from setting up
the auction at the club

10:46.840 --> 10:49.040
around 3:00, showered,

10:49.120 --> 10:51.560
got changed, left again
just after 4:00.

10:52.760 --> 10:54.040
And how was she?
In good spirits?

10:54.680 --> 10:56.520
Yeah, I suppose.

10:57.560 --> 10:58.760
She was fine.

10:58.840 --> 11:01.920
Nothing out of the ordinary
about her behaviour?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.800
Daisy seemed really upbeat
when she was with us
at the club earlier.

11:04.880 --> 11:07.200
The three of us spent
the morning preparing
the function room.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.400
WOMAN 1: You did
your shopping?
WOMAN 2: Yeah, just bored.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.120
And Finn, if you don't
mind me asking,

11:15.200 --> 11:17.160
why did you not want
to come with her
this afternoon?

11:19.360 --> 11:20.800
This place, it's...

11:20.880 --> 11:22.760
It's not really my scene,
you know?

11:22.840 --> 11:25.880
So, you went to the festival
in town instead?

11:25.960 --> 11:28.160
I must have got there
around 4:30

11:29.120 --> 11:30.880
and had a beer at Ziggy's bar.

11:30.960 --> 11:34.000
Which is where you picked up
the answerphone message?

11:34.080 --> 11:36.760
Yeah. That's when I came
to find you guys.

11:39.560 --> 11:42.920
Can any of you think of
a reason why someone might
want to do this to Daisy?

11:46.520 --> 11:47.680
I mean...

11:48.720 --> 11:51.320
She hardly knew anyone
on the island.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.120
Just her mates at the club.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.000
Finn and Daisy moved here
less than a year ago.

11:56.080 --> 11:59.440
That's why Daisy
joined the club.
To make new friends.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.880
It must have been someone
got into the club.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.080
Don't you think?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.800
Yeah, I suppose it must.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.240
Thank you.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.120
Well, thanks for
your cooperation.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.800
I really do appreciate your help
at this sensitive time.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.440
Oh, I almost forgot.

12:16.520 --> 12:19.000
Did Daisy have anything
to do at all with butterflies?

12:19.080 --> 12:20.680
Like, collect them or anything?

12:20.760 --> 12:22.120
No. Why?

12:23.120 --> 12:24.160
It's probably nothing.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.360
Ah, Chief.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.560
The crime scene's
been processed, and the
body has been released.

12:33.640 --> 12:37.000
Good stuff. JP, did you get
to search Mrs Anderson's car?

12:37.080 --> 12:38.160
Yes, I did.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.800
Find anything that might
lead to our killer?

12:39.880 --> 12:41.640
Well, the only thing I found
is this.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.960
It was shoved in the back
of the glove box.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.920
It's from Boutique Fleur.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.680
Probably means it's expensive.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.160
Well, I'll have to take
your word for it.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.640
Let's get it back
to the station.

12:50.720 --> 12:53.600
Um, there's nothing else
you'd like us to do now, Chief?

12:53.680 --> 12:55.120
I'm afraid so, Dwayne.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.960
There are 40-plus guests waiting
to have their statements taken,

12:57.040 --> 12:58.600
and photographs.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.320
So we won't be
getting back to the festival
any time soon, then?

13:01.400 --> 13:03.080
Sorry, not a chance.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.480
Inspector...

13:05.240 --> 13:06.400
(SIGHS)

13:08.240 --> 13:10.480
If there's nothing else
you need him for,

13:10.560 --> 13:12.520
I have said Mr Anderson
can go home now.

13:12.600 --> 13:13.960
Of course. Thanks again.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.160
Can I see her?

13:17.840 --> 13:18.960
I'll do it.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.600
Florence, how was he? Finn?

13:24.680 --> 13:26.440
You know, when you
broke the news?

13:26.520 --> 13:28.600
As you'd expect, devastated.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.720
There's something about him.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.520
It's been bothering me.
Ever since he came up to
us at Catherine's bar.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.960
-It's what he said.
-It's my wife.

13:37.040 --> 13:38.640
JACK: That he thought his wife
had been murdered.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.160
I think she's been murdered.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.760
-And?
-Well,

13:41.840 --> 13:43.560
up to that point,
he didn't know for sure

13:43.640 --> 13:45.920
that she had been murdered,
did he?

13:46.000 --> 13:49.280
The thing is, in
the phone message
that we listened to,

13:49.360 --> 13:51.080
you could hear Daisy
being attacked.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.600
But there was nothing definite
to say she was dead.

13:53.680 --> 13:55.800
Well, maybe he made
an assumption.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.360
Yeah. But you know,
I find that relatives

13:58.440 --> 14:01.680
tend to cling to the idea
that their loved ones
are still alive.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.960
They're not willing to
entertain the possibility
that they might be dead.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.160
-Almost always the case.
-Mmm-hmm. That's true.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.160
So why was Finn so ready

14:10.240 --> 14:12.600
to leap to the conclusion
that his wife had been murdered?

14:13.520 --> 14:14.560
Thanks.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.720
You think he knew
she was already dead.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.360
I'm just saying, in my book,
it's suspicious.

15:16.320 --> 15:19.200
Harry, your breakfast.
It's on the table.

15:25.240 --> 15:26.200
Harry?

15:29.880 --> 15:31.080
Come on.

15:31.680 --> 15:32.880
Stop your messin'.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.320
I know you're here somewhere.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.760
Not like you to not eat
your breakfast.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.280
Ah! There you are.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.160
JACK: He's definitely a
bit green around the gills.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.000
DWAYNE: Isn't he supposed to
be that colour?

15:51.080 --> 15:52.520
Being he's a lizard?

15:52.600 --> 15:55.000
-I suppose he does look a bit...
-Peaky?

15:55.080 --> 15:58.080
-Exactly, sir. Yes, peaky.
-Okay.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.320
Well, listen, let's keep
him here. Under observation.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.600
And if the symptoms get worse...

16:01.680 --> 16:03.720
We'll put the little fellow
out of his misery.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.520
No, Dwayne.
We'll take him to the vet.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.400
Vet?

16:07.480 --> 16:10.200
In the meantime,
we've got a murder
case to solve.

16:10.280 --> 16:12.840
He's going to take
a lizard to the vet?

16:12.920 --> 16:14.160
I've seen everything now.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.320
Now, yesterday,

16:15.400 --> 16:17.680
just after four o'clock,

16:17.760 --> 16:19.920
Daisy Anderson
left her house

16:20.000 --> 16:21.920
and drove to
the Saint Marie Yacht Club

16:23.480 --> 16:25.680
to attend the Fete Marie
Charity Auction.

16:25.760 --> 16:29.240
At 4:57, exactly,
a message was left

16:29.320 --> 16:32.120
from her mobile onto
her husband's answerphone,

16:32.200 --> 16:36.000
and in it, she was heard
being attacked by
someone with a knife.

16:36.080 --> 16:39.400
Her body was then discovered
by the Commissioner and myself,

16:39.480 --> 16:42.320
at 6:15 on the same evening.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.880
So between leaving
her house here
and being stabbed here,

16:45.960 --> 16:48.720
something drew our
victim's attention to the
yacht club lookout point.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.680
Now, our job is to work out
who lured poor Daisy Anderson
to her death.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.640
So, Dwayne, what do we
have so far on our victim?

16:54.720 --> 16:57.400
Thirty-two years of age,
originally from Wiltshire.

16:57.480 --> 17:00.760
Now, up until two years ago,
she was working as
a personal trainer.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.560
That's how she met
her husband.

17:02.640 --> 17:05.200
He was a member of a gym
she was working at.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.800
-JACK: Finn Anderson.
-The man is really rich.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.760
He created a download game.

17:09.840 --> 17:12.080
It was so popular
that just over a year ago,

17:12.160 --> 17:14.840
he sold it to a social media
company for £7 million.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.760
Seven million for a game?
The world's gone bonkers, JP.

17:17.840 --> 17:20.000
Finn and Daisy got married
when he sold the company

17:20.080 --> 17:22.360
and moved to the island
shortly after that.

17:22.440 --> 17:26.760
Now, her millionaire husband
is our only suspect so far.

17:26.840 --> 17:29.600
But he claims he was
in Ziggy's bar at the time
of the murder.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.120
Well, we went to
Ziggy's bar early
in the morning, sir,

17:32.200 --> 17:34.160
and we can confirm

17:34.240 --> 17:36.200
that Finn was seen
arriving at the bar

17:36.280 --> 17:38.720
at 4:30 p.m.

17:38.800 --> 17:42.640
And was seen leaving
looking worried,
just before 5:30 p.m.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.400
And you're sure about this?

17:46.480 --> 17:48.240
A hundred percent positive.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.440
A hundred percent, huh?
Well, that's pretty
conclusive.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.800
So, if Finn Anderson

17:54.880 --> 17:57.240
was seen at a bar in Honore

17:57.320 --> 17:58.920
between 4:30 p.m

17:59.880 --> 18:01.760
to 5:30,

18:01.840 --> 18:03.600
well then he couldn't very
well have killed his wife

18:03.680 --> 18:05.320
at the yacht club two miles away

18:05.400 --> 18:07.600
at 4:57 p.m., could he?

18:09.000 --> 18:11.040
So, if it wasn't Finn
who killed her,

18:11.120 --> 18:13.760
it must have been one of
the witnesses we
questioned last night.

18:13.840 --> 18:16.640
No way. We interviewed over
40 people in that room

18:16.720 --> 18:19.720
and not one of them said
they saw anybody leave.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.560
Well, what about CCTV?

18:21.640 --> 18:23.480
Well, there's one camera
in reception.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.920
I checked the footage,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.760
but it doesn't even show
the entrance of
the function room.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.400
Ah! Right, well.

18:30.480 --> 18:33.000
Why don't you lads head over
to Mr and Mrs Anderson's house

18:33.080 --> 18:34.520
and see what you
can find there?

18:34.600 --> 18:36.080
-Yes, Chief.
-Yes, sir.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.520
Sarge.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.280
Well, Florence.
What's the story?

18:40.360 --> 18:43.200
The bracelet JP found
in the victim's car.

18:43.280 --> 18:45.320
-What about it?
-It was obviously a gift,

18:45.400 --> 18:46.960
and it's very expensive.

18:47.040 --> 18:51.040
So why was it just pushed
into the back of the
glove compartment?

18:51.120 --> 18:53.000
-Like it was unwanted.
-Exactly.

18:53.080 --> 18:56.920
So I went to Boutique Fleur
and asked them to give me
all the details they had

18:57.000 --> 18:58.440
for the sale of the bracelet.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.640
-And?
-It was sold two weeks ago

19:00.720 --> 19:04.240
for $395 to a guy called
Adam Warner.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.360
Adam Warner?

19:07.560 --> 19:09.480
Adam... Warner.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.320
Let's see...

19:12.480 --> 19:14.480
Here.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.880
He's the club's
sailing instructor?

19:16.960 --> 19:18.240
Yeah.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.200
So what's the doing giving
one of its female members

19:20.280 --> 19:21.840
$400 pieces of jewellery?

19:32.480 --> 19:33.600
Um...

19:34.240 --> 19:36.520
I mean, I suppose.

19:36.600 --> 19:40.600
Yeah, there was a brief
dalliance of sorts between
myself and Mrs Anderson.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.680
Dalliance. And what
does that mean?

19:42.760 --> 19:45.520
-Playing footsies
under the table?
-We slept together.

19:46.640 --> 19:47.920
A handful of times or so.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.080
It was a physical thing,
you know. No more than that.

19:50.160 --> 19:53.400
-Mmm-hmm.
-So, why the expensive present?

19:53.480 --> 19:55.200
Just being gentlemanly,
I suppose.

19:55.280 --> 19:56.640
-Hmm.
-Look,

19:56.720 --> 19:59.000
I admit, I liked Daisy.
She was a good sort.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.240
But we both knew what
we were doing was
never gonna last.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.200
I'm not sure
I believe you, Adam.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.080
(STAMMERS)
I don't know what you mean.

20:07.160 --> 20:10.120
I mean I just find it hard
to believe that a young man
like yourself

20:10.200 --> 20:12.920
-earning, what, $200 a week...
-$210, actually.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.040
I stand corrected.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.000
Would spend half
his monthly salary

20:16.080 --> 20:19.560
on a gift for a lady,
unless he had very strong
feelings for the said lady.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.400
All right, yeah.

20:26.360 --> 20:27.560
I did have feelings for Daisy.

20:31.080 --> 20:33.040
She wasn't like
the other members.

20:33.120 --> 20:35.120
Banging on about
their bank accounts and BMWs.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.000
I thought she felt
the same about me.

20:44.560 --> 20:45.600
Until I gave her that.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.840
-Her face when she opened it.
-She wasn't impressed?

20:50.920 --> 20:52.720
Told me there and then
it was over between us,

20:52.800 --> 20:54.680
that we'd obviously
got crossed wires.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.640
I felt like I'd made
a total fool of myself.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.600
And tell me,
when was this, exactly?

20:58.680 --> 21:00.840
Couple of weeks ago.

21:00.920 --> 21:04.120
She switched instructors
the next day. After that,
she just blanked me.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.520
Must have hurt.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.840
Made you angry.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.040
Sorry.

21:12.120 --> 21:13.960
You don't think I did it,
do you?

21:14.040 --> 21:17.000
You wouldn't be the first
to kill someone over
a broken heart.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.760
So our victim had an affair,

21:20.840 --> 21:22.440
albeit a short-lived one.

21:22.520 --> 21:23.920
Finn never mentioned that,
did he?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.320
Maybe he didn't know.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.240
Or maybe he did.

21:27.320 --> 21:30.320
I had a feeling he was
hiding something. Perhaps it's
the fact he had motive.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.840
We need to talk to him.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.720
Now, is it me,
or did Mr Davenport run off

21:37.800 --> 21:39.440
like a scalded cat
at the sight of us?

21:39.520 --> 21:42.080
I'll see if I can find out
what he was up to.

21:44.600 --> 21:47.480
FLORENCE: Hi, I'm
a police officer,
investigating a death...

21:52.640 --> 21:54.800
FLORENCE: Sir.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.000
Mr Davenport was asking
the receptionist

21:57.080 --> 21:59.440
for yesterday's recordings
from the CCTV camera.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.200
And did she say
why he wanted them?

22:01.280 --> 22:04.400
Just that he seemed
really keen to get his
hands on the discs.

22:04.480 --> 22:07.000
I thought it might be
worth taking a look.

22:07.080 --> 22:08.640
(SIGHS) Good idea.

22:08.720 --> 22:11.440
Come on, let's go and see
what Finn Anderson has to
say for himself.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.840
You don't mind, do you?

22:26.800 --> 22:28.680
No, no. You dig in there.

22:28.760 --> 22:30.120
Hmm. Looks lovely.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.800
-Would you like a slice?
-Are you sure you don't mind?

22:37.520 --> 22:38.920
Right.

22:40.600 --> 22:41.680
Mm.

22:42.840 --> 22:44.520
So we were just wondering.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.000
Can you tell us,
how were things between
yourself and your wife

22:47.080 --> 22:50.080
over the past couple of months?

22:50.160 --> 22:53.120
I think we can take it
from that pause that things
weren't exactly rosy.

22:53.800 --> 22:54.880
No.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.400
I mean we were having
a rough patch.

22:56.480 --> 22:58.720
-You were arguing?
-Sometimes.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.200
What about?

23:00.280 --> 23:02.160
I'm not very outgoing,
you know?

23:02.240 --> 23:05.640
I just like staying in,
playing computer games
and stuff.

23:05.720 --> 23:08.640
I think she felt she sometimes
wanted a bit more from life.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.400
And tell me now, Finn,

23:10.480 --> 23:13.200
do you think that's why
your wife started sleeping
with another man?

23:14.920 --> 23:17.480
Aha! You see,
you hesitated again.

23:17.560 --> 23:20.600
You gave yourself away,
which tells me you
already knew.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.280
She told me a few days ago.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.440
Said she was sorry,
but that maybe
it was a wake-up call

23:27.520 --> 23:29.320
that we needed to make
some changes in our marriage.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.720
-And what did you say?
-I agreed.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.920
We both needed to try harder.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.600
And why did you not
mention this yesterday?

23:35.680 --> 23:37.080
I guess it didn't cross my mind.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.520
You know it
wasn't me, right?

23:40.600 --> 23:43.040
I was in a bar when
Daisy was killed.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.800
We know. We already checked.

23:47.280 --> 23:48.720
(FINN SIGHS)

23:55.360 --> 23:56.960
You think maybe I should
take his temperature?

23:57.040 --> 23:59.160
There must be a thermometer
in the first aid kit.

23:59.240 --> 24:02.360
Do you even know what
the lizard's temperature
is supposed to be, sir?

24:03.160 --> 24:04.360
JACK: Fair point, Florence.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.080
Sure, where would I stick it?

24:07.160 --> 24:09.400
(SIGHS) Maybe I'll just
give him some fresh water.

24:09.480 --> 24:12.400
Good idea. And if he's still
like this by the end of the day,

24:12.480 --> 24:13.920
we'll take him to the vet.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.920
(SIGHS)

24:17.000 --> 24:20.960
All right, let's stick our
suspect number two up
on the whiteboard.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.840
Though, after speaking to
Finn Anderson again,

24:22.920 --> 24:24.880
I'm even more convinced
that he's our man.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.480
But if it's him,
we still have no idea

24:27.560 --> 24:29.880
how he was able to stab Daisy
at the yacht club.

24:29.960 --> 24:33.240
When he was seen
at the exact time it happened
in a bar full of people.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.880
And if it wasn't him,
then how can anyone
else have done it

24:35.960 --> 24:38.960
when the rest of our suspects
were seen at the auction
when it happened?

24:39.040 --> 24:42.640
Oh, sir, the CCTV from
the club reception.

24:42.720 --> 24:45.720
Ah, yes. JP, we believe
there's something on it

24:45.800 --> 24:47.400
that Hugh Davenport
doesn't want us to see.

24:47.480 --> 24:48.760
We just don't know what.

24:48.840 --> 24:49.920
Okay.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.360
I'll go through it.

24:51.440 --> 24:53.200
And go back as far as you can
on the day of the murder.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.480
We know that Hugh and Daisy
were there together getting
the club ready.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.400
Okay.

24:57.480 --> 25:00.240
I'll have Dwayne sort through
the items we recovered
from the victim's study.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.240
Great, and while you're at that

25:02.320 --> 25:04.640
I think I'll pay a visit
to our local mayor.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.640
She knows who's who
at the yacht club.

25:10.680 --> 25:13.960
So, as host of the auction,
I take it you had a good
view of the room,

25:14.040 --> 25:16.640
seen who was coming or going.

25:16.720 --> 25:17.880
Yes.

25:17.960 --> 25:19.600
I was on stage
for the whole thing.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.360
Sold! Twenty-five.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.160
I could see everyone.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.440
All right. And did
anyone leave the room

25:27.520 --> 25:30.160
between the time the auction
started at 4:30 p.m

25:30.240 --> 25:31.240
and when we turned up?

25:32.360 --> 25:33.360
No one.

25:36.200 --> 25:39.560
There was something I wanted
to tell you about, though.

25:39.640 --> 25:40.920
About Daisy Anderson.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.960
-Oh, yes.
-Two weeks ago,

25:44.040 --> 25:48.520
Daisy was alone at the bar
going over some papers.

25:48.600 --> 25:49.680
It's so hot today.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.360
MAYOR: She ordered a drink

25:51.440 --> 25:54.040
and was asking me whether
I knew about
a charity called...

25:54.120 --> 25:55.360
Project Saint Marie?

25:55.440 --> 25:57.520
I told her I had
never heard of it.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.200
She looked puzzled.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.040
Said I must have got it wrong.

26:01.120 --> 26:04.760
But it's part of my job
as mayor to be across
all the island charities

26:04.840 --> 26:07.920
and there's no such thing
as Project Saint Marie.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.640
And what would this have
to do with the yacht club?

26:11.280 --> 26:13.840
MAYOR: I saw that the papers
she was going over

26:13.920 --> 26:15.640
had the club logo at the top.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.280
Daisy saw I'd noticed

26:19.360 --> 26:20.480
and covered them up.

26:20.560 --> 26:22.080
What sort of papers?
Could you tell?

26:22.160 --> 26:24.640
It looked like they were
from the club's accounts.

26:24.720 --> 26:26.360
And Daisy was
definitely troubled?

26:27.400 --> 26:28.480
Very.

26:35.520 --> 26:38.520
Saint Marie National Bank
never heard of
Project Saint Marie,

26:38.600 --> 26:41.280
let alone have an account
registered in that name.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.640
What about the cooperative?

26:43.600 --> 26:44.920
They have a business account

26:45.000 --> 26:46.680
set up two years ago
in that name.

26:46.760 --> 26:49.560
Receives a thousand dollars
a month in untaxed donations.

26:49.640 --> 26:51.440
It's not a registered charity
on the island?

26:51.520 --> 26:54.520
It's basically a cover for
the account holder's
personal finance.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.280
They're funnelling money from
the yacht club into
their own account

26:57.360 --> 26:59.640
under the pretence
of charitable donations.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.120
Whose name is the account in?

27:01.200 --> 27:03.440
Wait for it,
Club Secretary and Treasurer

27:03.520 --> 27:04.680
Charlotte Hamilton, no less.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.800
(MOTOR RUNNING)

27:22.640 --> 27:23.760
Afternoon, Inspector.

27:23.840 --> 27:25.600
Afternoon, Mrs Hamilton.

27:25.680 --> 27:27.360
Very impressive.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.280
-Do you have a moment?
-Yes, of course. How can I help?

27:29.360 --> 27:31.520
Well, it might be better
if we went inside.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.520
I see, oh. Do come in.

27:38.280 --> 27:41.120
(POURS DRINK)

27:41.200 --> 27:43.640
-Lovely place you've got here.
-Thank you.

27:43.720 --> 27:45.440
Takes some upkeep, I imagine.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.400
Well, I have help.

27:47.480 --> 27:50.520
And I've lived in this house
ever since I moved to
the island with my husband.

27:50.600 --> 27:53.720
So there's a fair few
memories I'm not quite
ready to let go of.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.880
And when did he pass away,
your husband? If you don't
mind me asking.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.240
Four years ago.

27:58.720 --> 27:59.680
Cancer.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.880
Sorry about that.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.440
So did he not leave you much
in his inheritance, then?

28:05.520 --> 28:07.440
I beg your pardon?

28:07.520 --> 28:10.000
No, it's just, I've been
trying to work out why you're
fleecing the yacht club.

28:10.080 --> 28:11.880
For what is it?
A thousand dollars every month?

28:11.960 --> 28:14.400
What on Earth are you
talking about?

28:14.480 --> 28:17.920
Does Project Saint Marie mean
anything to you?

28:18.000 --> 28:20.280
I imagine you might prefer
something a little stronger.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.280
Yes, I think I rather would.
Do you mind?

28:27.720 --> 28:29.520
I don't suppose you...

28:29.600 --> 28:30.560
No, you're grand.

28:32.120 --> 28:34.840
May I ask how you found out?

28:34.920 --> 28:37.440
Mrs Anderson was seen
studying the club accounts

28:37.520 --> 28:40.200
and overheard asking questions
about Project Saint Marie.

28:42.960 --> 28:45.120
You were right about
my husband.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.880
He was a banker.
Liked taking risks.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.600
Ended up taking one too many.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.200
He left me with very little.

28:54.120 --> 28:56.160
Which is why you stole
money from the club?

28:56.240 --> 28:57.480
I didn't...

28:57.920 --> 28:59.080
(SIGHS)

28:59.160 --> 29:01.280
I didn't think anyone
would notice.

29:01.360 --> 29:05.160
And I'm the treasurer,
so I oversee where all
the money is allocated.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.720
Nobody has ever
shown the least interest.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.360
But then Mrs Anderson did.

29:10.680 --> 29:12.040
As soon as Daisy arrived,

29:12.120 --> 29:13.920
she threw herself into
everything to do
with the club.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.440
Including its charity work?

29:16.720 --> 29:19.440
Yeah. Could you not just
have got yourself a job?

29:20.400 --> 29:21.840
Doing what?

29:21.920 --> 29:25.440
I have a reputation to uphold.
I'm the club secretary,

29:25.520 --> 29:28.120
its treasurer, and
people respect me.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.680
I could hardly be seen
manning the checkout at
the local Mini Mart.

29:33.760 --> 29:36.720
I assume Daisy finding
out the truth
had you worried.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.720
You could be charged
with theft, fraud.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.600
I was... I am going to pay
all the money back.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.760
I'm selling what I can.

29:46.840 --> 29:49.600
Old paintings, furniture.

29:49.680 --> 29:51.760
That's why I was washing down
the speedboat.

29:53.040 --> 29:55.480
Look, I admit I haven't acted

29:55.560 --> 29:58.720
with much dignity these past
couple of years.

29:58.800 --> 30:02.000
But I can assure you,
I haven't sunk to the depths
of committing murder

30:02.080 --> 30:04.880
in order to solve
my financial problems.

30:07.480 --> 30:08.800
Yeah.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.120
And then there were three.

30:11.200 --> 30:14.600
Charlotte Hamilton,
Adam Warner and Finn Anderson.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.200
-And they all have motives.
-And all of them have alibis.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.160
Adam and Charlotte
were inside the clubhouse.

30:19.240 --> 30:21.520
And Finn was at a bar in town.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.320
Which means none of them
could have done it.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.800
So if it wasn't one of them,
then who?

30:24.880 --> 30:28.480
And why? Why did Daisy Anderson
have to die yesterday?

30:28.560 --> 30:31.360
And while we're asking questions
with unfathomable answers,

30:31.440 --> 30:32.720
can someone also tell me

30:32.800 --> 30:34.720
what this little chap
was doing at our crime scene?

30:34.800 --> 30:36.400
I went online,
and the Commissioner was right.

30:36.480 --> 30:38.600
This type of butterfly should
have been deep in hibernation.

30:38.680 --> 30:40.240
Or whatever it
is butterflies do.

30:40.320 --> 30:42.760
So what was it doing
tucked under our victim's
posy of flowers?

30:42.840 --> 30:46.000
Uh, sir. I've got
something for you.

30:46.080 --> 30:49.880
(SIGHS) Okay, I've been
checking through the CCTV
at the reception,

30:49.960 --> 30:51.400
like you asked,

30:51.480 --> 30:55.400
and just before 1:00,
Hugh and Daisy can
be seen leaving.

30:55.480 --> 30:58.720
But just before they go,
the stop and talk
for a moment. Look.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.640
FLORENCE: Whatever he said,
she clearly didn't like it.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.080
At all.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.000
Uh, Chief, if it's any help,

31:10.080 --> 31:12.720
my Aunty Jean has been
hearing impaired since birth,

31:12.800 --> 31:14.640
but she's a real dab hand
at reading lips.

31:14.720 --> 31:17.200
Really? And you think
she'll be up for looking
at the footage for us?

31:17.280 --> 31:19.480
Help solve a murder case?
She would be over the moon.

31:19.560 --> 31:21.520
Great! Well,
first thing tomorrow.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.920
We'll see if Dwayne's
Aunty Jean can
work out exactly

31:24.000 --> 31:26.160
what Hugh said to
upset Daisy Anderson.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.800
Until then, I say
we call it a day.

31:28.360 --> 31:29.600
Goodbye.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.920
Okay, Harry. Enough's enough.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.720
Time to get you to the vet.

31:41.960 --> 31:43.840
You're not coming, Dwayne?

31:43.920 --> 31:46.240
I might stay a while here
and do some paperwork,
you know?

31:46.320 --> 31:47.480
What?

31:48.120 --> 31:50.120
Dwayne...

31:50.200 --> 31:53.760
Look, if I give it an hour
or so before I go over
to Darlene's house,

31:53.840 --> 31:55.320
Elize will be asleep,
which means

31:55.400 --> 31:57.280
I don't have to spend
any time with her, okay?

32:01.440 --> 32:02.720
Okay.

32:14.120 --> 32:15.280
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

32:15.640 --> 32:16.960
Come in.

32:17.040 --> 32:19.960
I'm really sorry I couldn't
get here earlier, Darlene.

32:20.040 --> 32:24.200
I'm afraid we've got
a really demanding
murder investigation going on.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.800
-(GROANS)
-Here.

32:28.200 --> 32:30.080
-Sounds like you've earned this.
-Thank you.

32:32.760 --> 32:35.120
-Wait, you're not joining me?
-(CHUCKLES)

32:35.200 --> 32:36.520
I need something a bit stronger.

32:37.280 --> 32:38.680
Oh.

32:38.760 --> 32:39.840
Everything all right?

32:41.280 --> 32:43.000
I'm just a bit tired,
that's all.

32:43.080 --> 32:45.280
I didn't get a wink of sleep
last night.

32:45.360 --> 32:48.200
Elize kept on waking up
with nightmares.

32:48.280 --> 32:50.480
I think taking her to
Fete Marie wasn't
the best idea.

32:52.160 --> 32:53.960
Aunty Darlene...

32:54.880 --> 32:57.000
I can't sleep, I'm scared.

32:57.080 --> 32:58.600
Oh, darling.

33:00.200 --> 33:01.840
Why don't you go back to bed

33:01.920 --> 33:03.840
and I will come read you
a story, okay?

33:05.200 --> 33:06.160
Go on.

33:09.440 --> 33:12.840
Look, if Elize is scared,
and you're tired,

33:12.920 --> 33:14.960
why don't I go in there
and tell her the story

33:15.040 --> 33:18.120
and you stay here and finish
your rum, hmm?

33:18.200 --> 33:20.080
-You sure?
-Of course.

33:20.160 --> 33:23.200
I mean, who better than
Officer Dwayne Myers to
go in and reassure her?

33:24.880 --> 33:25.960
(CHUCKLES)

33:28.480 --> 33:30.960
So when Carlton got back
to the hideout on the beach,

33:31.040 --> 33:33.280
he saw Beatrice was there
waiting for him.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.280
And she did not look happy.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.840
Um, Elize?

33:40.920 --> 33:44.960
Your Aunty Darlene tells me
you've been having
some nightmares.

33:45.040 --> 33:47.160
-Is that right?
-Yes.

33:47.240 --> 33:51.000
Well, let me tell you
a real story.

33:51.080 --> 33:53.720
When I was young
and I had a bad dream,

33:53.800 --> 33:57.200
I would draw a picture of
whatever was frightening me,

33:57.880 --> 33:59.520
fold the paper over,

33:59.600 --> 34:01.640
and throw it into the bin.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.680
And if I did that,

34:03.760 --> 34:05.720
all the bad thoughts
would go away.

34:05.800 --> 34:06.840
Guaranteed!

34:08.120 --> 34:10.240
So...

34:10.320 --> 34:13.280
If you ever have another
bad dream, you do that.

34:13.360 --> 34:15.160
-Okay?
-Okay.

34:16.200 --> 34:17.160
Now,

34:17.760 --> 34:19.480
where were we?

34:19.560 --> 34:21.360
"There you are," said Beatrice.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.920
"I've been waiting
here all day."

34:24.000 --> 34:25.120
(ELIZE GIGGLING)

34:34.840 --> 34:37.640
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning, Florence.

34:37.720 --> 34:39.680
How did things go
at the vet's?

34:39.760 --> 34:41.800
Oh, he said Harry's
definitely not well.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.440
And I did the right thing
bringing him in.

34:43.520 --> 34:45.560
The thing about lizards,
they're small and fragile.

34:45.640 --> 34:48.560
If anything goes wrong, well,
not much you can do.

34:51.360 --> 34:53.080
Anyway, he's kept Harry
in overnight,

34:53.160 --> 34:55.360
said he'd call me
this morning and let me
know what's happening.

34:55.440 --> 34:56.840
I'm sorry, sir.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.920
Just can't believe I'm...

35:00.000 --> 35:01.960
I mean, he's just a lizard
for Pete's sake.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.400
Maybe he's more than that.
Like it or not,

35:04.480 --> 35:07.440
perhaps Harry's become a part
of your new life here.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.360
Maybe.

35:10.440 --> 35:13.240
All I know is sitting here
moping is not gonna help.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.960
So come on. Let's see
what Dwayne's Aunty Jean's
got for us.

35:17.360 --> 35:19.080
(EXHALES)

35:19.160 --> 35:21.840
Come and sit, Aunty.

35:21.920 --> 35:24.080
-JP, how are we getting on?
-(EXHALES)

35:24.160 --> 35:27.440
Aunty Jean
is basically amazing.

35:27.520 --> 35:30.600
She managed to tell us
everything that Hugh Davenport
said to Mrs Anderson

35:30.680 --> 35:31.960
on the CCTV footage.

35:32.040 --> 35:33.640
Brilliant. Does it
give us anything?

35:33.720 --> 35:36.480
If you ask me, sir,
Mr Davenport is a
nasty piece of work.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.360
-How so?
-Well,

35:38.440 --> 35:40.480
we think he was
blackmailing Daisy.

35:40.560 --> 35:43.400
He'd somehow found out
about her affair
with Adam Warner,

35:43.480 --> 35:46.360
said he'd tell her
husband unless,
and I quote,

35:46.440 --> 35:48.520
"We can come to some kind
of arrangement."

35:48.880 --> 35:50.080
Meaning?

35:50.160 --> 35:52.040
Well, he said it while
he was stroking her cheek.

35:52.120 --> 35:54.560
I think he was blackmailing
her to sleep with him, sir.

35:54.640 --> 35:56.120
Creepy old lech.

35:56.200 --> 35:57.360
We need to talk to him.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.000
Here, give these
to Aunty Jean.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.360
Uh... Aunty...

36:14.640 --> 36:17.600
You're after these I believe,
Mr Davenport?

36:17.680 --> 36:20.280
I thought I'd just check to see
if there was any sign of

36:20.360 --> 36:22.480
who might have killed
Mrs Anderson.

36:22.560 --> 36:26.320
So it wasn't because you
wanted to destroy evidence
of your conversation

36:26.400 --> 36:28.280
with Daisy the day
she was killed?

36:28.360 --> 36:29.440
Conversation?

36:29.880 --> 36:31.240
We, um...

36:31.320 --> 36:32.960
We spoke about quite
a bit that day.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.840
About club stuff and such.

36:35.920 --> 36:39.880
The conversation in which
you promised not to reveal
Mrs Anderson's affair

36:39.960 --> 36:43.520
with Adam Warner
in return for sexual favours.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.080
Ringing any bells, Hugh?

36:46.240 --> 36:48.080
You make it sound so sordid.

36:49.960 --> 36:53.160
Do you know, when I came out to
the Caribbean? 1974.

36:54.360 --> 36:56.160
I was chief engineer

36:56.240 --> 36:59.560
for the oil fields
off the coast
of Trinidad and Tobago.

36:59.640 --> 37:01.960
By the time I retired,
I was rich.

37:03.360 --> 37:06.960
But I had never stopped
to find someone

37:08.040 --> 37:09.560
to share my life with.

37:09.640 --> 37:12.640
And here was a young woman
you thought you could
manipulate?

37:12.720 --> 37:15.720
She wasn't blameless.
She was the one who
was sleeping around.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.120
Okay. (LAUGHS)

37:17.200 --> 37:19.160
So it's her own fault
she was blackmailed?

37:19.240 --> 37:21.720
-It wasn't blackmail.
-JACK: No?

37:21.800 --> 37:24.240
Threatening to reveal
her secret if she didn't
do your

37:24.320 --> 37:26.080
grubby bidding. What was it?

37:26.160 --> 37:28.720
Well, I wasn't gonna go
through with it, was I?

37:28.800 --> 37:30.760
I was just trying it on.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.160
That's all.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.280
Tell me, Hugh, what did she say
when she left here

37:34.360 --> 37:35.920
at the end of
the conversation?

37:36.000 --> 37:38.040
-What do you mean?
-I mean, did she threaten to

37:38.120 --> 37:40.480
tell the club officials
or go to the police?

37:40.560 --> 37:42.000
Ah, do you mean

37:42.080 --> 37:46.040
did she say something
that might give me reason
to murder her?

37:46.120 --> 37:48.120
-Yeah.
-Don't be ridiculous.

37:49.640 --> 37:51.320
She told me where to go.

37:51.400 --> 37:54.320
That's about the sum of it.
And just to be clear,

37:54.400 --> 37:57.880
as she walked away,
I just thought to myself,

37:57.960 --> 38:00.280
"Well, there goes
another one."

38:04.480 --> 38:07.280
Mr Davenport is clearly
a horrible person,

38:07.360 --> 38:10.080
but I don't think he sees
what he did as wrong.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.280
So would he commit
murder over it?

38:13.880 --> 38:15.120
Sir?

38:15.200 --> 38:17.120
Sorry, Florence,
I was listening.

38:17.200 --> 38:20.680
And I quite agree,
I don't think he has a clue
how appallingly he's behaved.

38:20.760 --> 38:22.480
What is it, sir?
Something's bothering you?

38:22.560 --> 38:23.960
There's a gap in our timeline.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.720
I don't know why
I didn't pick up on it before.

38:25.800 --> 38:26.880
What do you mean?

38:26.960 --> 38:30.080
Well, the CCTV
of Hugh and Daisy's conversation

38:30.160 --> 38:32.760
shows her leaving the clubhouse
at 1:00 p.m...

38:32.840 --> 38:34.640
Daisy...

38:34.720 --> 38:36.080
...on the day of her murder.

38:36.160 --> 38:38.080
But when we questioned Finn,

38:38.160 --> 38:39.800
the same day, he told us...

38:39.880 --> 38:43.600
Daisy got back from setting up
the auction at the club
around 3:00.

38:43.680 --> 38:45.720
That's a whole two hours
unaccounted for.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.400
You're right, sir.

38:47.480 --> 38:49.000
So where did she go?

38:49.080 --> 38:50.760
I mean, it could be
anywhere on the island.

38:55.160 --> 38:56.280
Satnav.

39:07.520 --> 39:09.240
Okay, let's see.

39:09.320 --> 39:10.520
Here we go.

39:10.600 --> 39:13.720
Recent destinations.

39:13.800 --> 39:17.240
Last journey programmed in,
four minutes past 1:00,
two days ago.

39:17.320 --> 39:20.560
Just when she was leaving
the yacht club after
speaking with you.

39:20.640 --> 39:23.680
-Hugh Davenport.
-35 Rue d'Orphan.
Mean anything?

39:23.760 --> 39:25.160
FLORENCE: Let me find out.

39:27.080 --> 39:30.720
Here we are. 35 Rue d'Orphan
is a business address.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.520
Johnson and Bird.

39:32.600 --> 39:35.920
They are solicitors
who specialise in family law.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.040
So Daisy Anderson went to
see a solicitor the afternoon
she was killed.

39:40.400 --> 39:42.920
A visit to a solicitor
specialising in family law

39:43.000 --> 39:44.880
when her own marriage
wasn't in the best of nick.

39:44.960 --> 39:47.200
(CLAPS HANDS) Well,
it's got to be filing
for divorce.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.440
You wait right there, okay?

39:53.480 --> 39:54.600
Dwayne.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.080
Yeah?

39:57.800 --> 39:59.480
Darlene, what you doing here?

39:59.560 --> 40:01.960
I was clearing out Elize's room

40:03.160 --> 40:05.480
when I found this in her bin.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.320
I think I know why she's been
having these nightmares.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.160
JP!

40:14.720 --> 40:17.800
Wasn't Daisy Anderson wearing
a black and white dress
when she was murdered?

40:17.880 --> 40:19.040
Hmm.

40:19.120 --> 40:21.120
It also looks a hell
of a lot like Finn.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.800
Now, Elize, you're sure
this is what you saw?

40:28.640 --> 40:30.200
And it was here in the town,

40:30.280 --> 40:31.800
when the big festival
was going on?

40:31.880 --> 40:35.400
I'd run ahead from Uncle Dwayne
because I wanted a coconut ice.

40:35.480 --> 40:37.840
And then you saw a man
looking like this?

40:37.920 --> 40:40.720
And he was holding a knife up
to a lady looking like this?

40:42.120 --> 40:44.000
You're being so brave, Elize.

40:44.080 --> 40:45.800
Now, my last question, Elize.

40:45.880 --> 40:47.280
And then I'm sure your
Aunty Darlene

40:47.360 --> 40:49.920
is gonna buy you the biggest
coconut ice you've ever seen!

40:51.840 --> 40:53.280
Can you remember where
this happened?

41:02.280 --> 41:04.160
Right, let's spread out.

41:04.240 --> 41:05.320
Good girl.

41:18.240 --> 41:19.480
Sir.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.680
JP, do your thing.

41:40.720 --> 41:43.080
Yup. It's blood, sir.

41:43.160 --> 41:45.640
So, potentially this is where
Daisy Anderson was killed.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.800
And it looks like you
were right. It was Finn
who did it.

41:47.880 --> 41:51.800
Yeah. Dwayne, JP,
I want samples of this blood
sent to the lab ASAP.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.440
But if the murder happened here

41:53.520 --> 41:57.880
and Elize witnessed it
just before she was
taken home at half three,

41:57.960 --> 42:00.120
that's an hour-and-a-half before
the voice message was left

42:00.200 --> 42:01.480
when we heard Daisy
being killed.

42:01.560 --> 42:03.440
I know, I can't figure
it out either.

42:03.520 --> 42:06.640
But if we got the time
of death wrong, and it was
earlier than we thought,

42:06.720 --> 42:09.480
well, then that means
Finn Anderson no longer
has an alibi.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.160
Means he could have
done it after all.

42:13.880 --> 42:16.040
FINN: What do you mean
you got a witness who
saw me do it?

42:16.120 --> 42:18.240
Someone saw you stabbing
Daisy Anderson

42:18.320 --> 42:19.880
in an alleyway in Honore

42:19.960 --> 42:23.280
-at 3:30 two days ago.
-That's impossible.

42:23.360 --> 42:26.240
Her body was found at
the yacht club when it was
three minutes to 5:00.

42:26.320 --> 42:28.160
We've also found
evidence of blood

42:28.240 --> 42:32.000
in an alleyway, which
we're convinced
will prove to be Daisy's.

42:32.080 --> 42:34.040
And there is something
else we found.

42:34.120 --> 42:36.640
Yeah, it's been a busy old day
for us, Finn.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.600
Daisy was filing for divorce.

42:39.960 --> 42:42.240
-I didn't know that.
-You see, you did it again.

42:42.320 --> 42:45.080
You paused. If you wanted
us to believe you didn't know,

42:45.160 --> 42:47.600
you need to come straight out
with it. Really sell it to us.

42:47.680 --> 42:50.960
Like this is the first time
you heard any mention
of divorce.

42:51.040 --> 42:52.600
Now, I'll tell you what
I think happened.

42:52.680 --> 42:56.160
And you feel free to tell me
if I've got it right or wrong.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.840
I think Daisy didn't leave
your house at 4:00

42:58.920 --> 43:00.320
as you suggested.

43:00.400 --> 43:02.080
JACK: I think it was earlier
than that.

43:02.160 --> 43:04.160
Sometime around 3:00.

43:04.240 --> 43:06.680
But something stopped her.

43:06.760 --> 43:09.720
And I'll hazard a guess
that she decided to come back

43:09.800 --> 43:12.320
as you two had
unfinished business.

43:14.720 --> 43:16.680
Now, we know things had been
strained between you,

43:16.760 --> 43:19.000
a lot of arguing.
Daisy had an affair.

43:19.080 --> 43:22.760
And that afternoon,
she'd gone to a solicitor
to discuss divorce.

43:22.840 --> 43:24.200
JACK: And according to him,
she said

43:24.280 --> 43:27.000
she was going to speak to you
about it the same day.

43:27.080 --> 43:29.120
And I imagine you probably
didn't want to.

43:29.200 --> 43:30.960
You probably knew what
was coming.

43:31.040 --> 43:34.520
So you walked out of
there insisting you were
going to the festival.

43:35.200 --> 43:36.360
But Daisy came with you.

43:37.200 --> 43:38.760
JACK: She forced you

43:38.840 --> 43:40.200
-to listen to what
she had to say.
-Finn!

43:42.000 --> 43:44.640
It's over. Okay?

43:44.720 --> 43:46.440
It's over.

43:46.520 --> 43:48.760
And I imagine you didn't
take too kindly

43:48.840 --> 43:51.000
to hearing that Daisy
was leaving you.

43:51.080 --> 43:53.320
Because there's one thing
I've come to learn
about you, Finn,

43:53.400 --> 43:55.920
you don't like not having
things your own way.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.680
On top of which,
if Daisy did leave you,

43:58.760 --> 44:01.360
she'd take a share of
your £7 million.

44:01.440 --> 44:04.400
I can imagine
that made you angry.

44:04.480 --> 44:07.040
JACK: So in the heat of
the moment, you got your
hands on a knife.

44:10.200 --> 44:12.160
And when you were out of sight
from the crowds,

44:12.240 --> 44:13.600
you stabbed your wife.

44:13.680 --> 44:14.840
What are you do...

44:14.920 --> 44:18.120
Killing her stone dead.
So, Finn,

44:18.200 --> 44:19.440
am I right?

44:21.720 --> 44:24.360
If it was me, and I stabbed her
in that alleyway,

44:24.440 --> 44:27.080
explain this. How come she was
found at the yacht club?

44:27.160 --> 44:28.440
I assume you moved her body.

44:28.520 --> 44:30.040
In the middle of Honore
on the day of the festival?

44:30.120 --> 44:32.480
You guys were there.
You saw the place.
It was heaving.

44:32.560 --> 44:35.720
How did I manage to take
a body across the street

44:35.800 --> 44:38.000
and into a boot of a car,
and not get caught?

44:40.640 --> 44:42.360
I don't know what it was
that your witness saw,

44:43.240 --> 44:45.520
but it wasn't me
killing Daisy.

44:49.240 --> 44:52.640
JACK: From the start,
one suspect has been the main
focus of our attention.

44:52.720 --> 44:55.080
-Finn Anderson.
-He's lied to us
more than once.

44:55.160 --> 44:58.160
We know Daisy had betrayed
him and was also about
to abandon him.

44:58.240 --> 44:59.600
He's steeped in motive.

44:59.680 --> 45:01.960
On top of which we have
a witness who claims

45:02.040 --> 45:04.840
she saw him stabbing Daisy
during the festival in Honore.

45:04.920 --> 45:06.640
So why haven't we
arrested him then?

45:06.720 --> 45:09.720
Because if Finn murdered
his wife at the festival
in Honore at 3:30,

45:09.800 --> 45:11.960
then we still have no idea
how he managed to move the body

45:12.040 --> 45:14.880
two miles across the island
to the yacht club.

45:14.960 --> 45:17.720
And there's something else
I've realised doesn't
make any sense.

45:17.800 --> 45:20.360
The answerphone message.
Where we hear Daisy
being stabbed.

45:20.440 --> 45:23.120
-What about it?
-There was no noise
in the background.

45:23.200 --> 45:26.080
If the murder took place
in town, we would've heard
the festival going on.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.640
You're right, sir, we would.

45:27.720 --> 45:29.520
(MUMBLING)

45:29.600 --> 45:31.240
-(PHONE RINGING)
-I'll get it, sir.

45:31.320 --> 45:35.040
So, if Daisy wasn't killed
at the festival by Finn,

45:35.120 --> 45:36.720
then it must have happened
at the yacht club.

45:36.800 --> 45:39.280
Which brings us back
to the three members

45:39.360 --> 45:41.440
we found so far
who have motives.

45:41.520 --> 45:43.200
Sir, it's the vet.

45:43.280 --> 45:44.840
(SIGHS)

45:46.080 --> 45:48.520
Hello? Uh-huh.

45:49.120 --> 45:50.720
Oh.

45:50.800 --> 45:53.520
Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

45:55.440 --> 45:57.280
He's on the mend.

45:57.360 --> 45:59.480
They still have no idea
what was wrong with him.

45:59.560 --> 46:01.160
It was touch and go
there for a while.

46:01.240 --> 46:03.520
My little fella fought it off
and he pulled through.

46:03.600 --> 46:05.840
-That's a relief.
-Yeah, that's great news, sir.

46:05.920 --> 46:09.640
Oh, yes. The little lizard
gets to fight another day.
Hurray!

46:12.440 --> 46:14.680
The little lizard lives
to fight another day.

46:14.760 --> 46:16.760
I just said that.

46:16.840 --> 46:19.000
He fought if off and
pulled through.

46:19.080 --> 46:20.480
Are you all right, sir?

46:20.560 --> 46:22.640
But that's what happens
at the Fete Marie, isn't it?

46:22.720 --> 46:24.880
The dead come back to life,
don't they?

46:24.960 --> 46:27.880
Of course they do!
I don't know why it's taken
me so long to realise it.

46:32.640 --> 46:35.560
Finn, get off!
(SCREAMS)

46:35.640 --> 46:37.160
And she valued our friendship.

46:38.280 --> 46:40.360
You make it sound so sordid.

46:48.920 --> 46:51.040
She wasn't like
the other members.

46:51.120 --> 46:53.360
Banging on about
their bank accounts and BMWs.

46:59.560 --> 47:00.840
FLORENCE: Are you okay, sir?

47:00.920 --> 47:02.720
-Do you know who did it?
-Florence, I do.

47:02.800 --> 47:04.280
And what's more,
I know where they did it.

47:04.360 --> 47:06.040
Okay, so which one was it, sir?

47:06.120 --> 47:08.360
Was Daisy Anderson murdered
in the alleyway

47:08.440 --> 47:10.960
in the town during the festival
or up at the yacht club?

47:11.040 --> 47:13.360
Neither, JP. It happened
somewhere else entirely.

47:20.600 --> 47:23.720
Tradition has it that the leaves
of the jatropha plant

47:23.800 --> 47:26.840
carry mystic powers to ward off
evil spirits.

47:26.920 --> 47:29.040
Now, sadly, this old
Saint Marie custom,

47:29.120 --> 47:31.960
it's no more than folklore,
a myth.

47:32.040 --> 47:36.320
Because despite wearing this,
someone who is sitting
here right now

47:36.400 --> 47:40.160
plunged the knife deep into
Daisy Anderson's heart
and killed her.

47:40.240 --> 47:41.280
So which one of you did it?

47:44.920 --> 47:47.320
At every turn during
this investigation

47:47.400 --> 47:50.800
the evidence we uncovered kept
bringing us back to Finn.

47:50.880 --> 47:54.800
First it was the fact that
he neglected to tell us
about Daisy's infidelity.

47:54.880 --> 47:58.040
But then we discovered
that Daisy had been
to see a solicitor,

47:58.120 --> 48:00.640
and told Finn she
wanted a divorce.

48:00.720 --> 48:03.760
Yes, and the final nail
in his coffin, we found
a witness

48:03.840 --> 48:06.200
who saw him attack
Daisy with a knife

48:06.280 --> 48:08.080
in an alleyway in Honore

48:08.160 --> 48:09.680
during the recent festivities.

48:09.760 --> 48:13.480
Except if Finn was the man
seen stabbing Daisy

48:13.560 --> 48:17.160
at 3:30 the afternoon
of the Fete Marie Festival,

48:17.240 --> 48:20.120
then how come we've got
an answerphone recording

48:20.200 --> 48:24.160
of the murder taking
place an hour-and-a-half
later at 4:57 p.m.?

48:24.240 --> 48:26.000
It's baffling.

48:26.080 --> 48:33.080
Message received Thursday,
1st February, 2018
at 4:57 p.m.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.040
DAISY: What are you doing?

48:35.120 --> 48:36.480
Put the knife down.

48:36.560 --> 48:38.560
Please put it down!

48:38.640 --> 48:40.080
Get off me!

48:40.160 --> 48:42.480
No!

48:42.560 --> 48:44.960
(SCREAMS)

48:45.720 --> 48:46.840
So who was it?

48:47.200 --> 48:48.680
Come on.

48:48.760 --> 48:52.200
Who was it wielding the knife
when that was recorded?

48:52.280 --> 48:55.240
Who was it who stabbed
and killed Daisy?

49:03.000 --> 49:04.480
It was you, Charlotte,
wasn't it?

49:06.400 --> 49:07.720
I'm sorry, you...

49:07.800 --> 49:09.240
You think it was me?

49:09.320 --> 49:11.880
You murdered Daisy Anderson
in cold blood.

49:11.960 --> 49:13.800
I'm gonna tell you
how it happened.

49:13.880 --> 49:17.400
Strange as it may sound,
Finn did attempt to kill Daisy

49:17.480 --> 49:19.600
in the alleyway that afternoon,
but he didn't succeed.

49:19.680 --> 49:22.640
Now, we know Daisy had
defensive wounds on her arms.

49:22.720 --> 49:24.920
JACK: She must have lashed out
to protect herself.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.520
Must have hurt.

49:26.600 --> 49:28.200
Caused her to cry out in pain.

49:28.280 --> 49:31.520
And in that moment,
she looked at you
terrified and bewildered.

49:31.600 --> 49:33.240
-(SCREAMS)
-I think you suddenly realised

49:33.320 --> 49:35.000
what you were doing, Finn.

49:35.080 --> 49:37.720
Because I think at heart,
you are a weak person,
aren't you?

49:37.800 --> 49:39.920
You said yourself that
you don't find life easy.

49:40.000 --> 49:43.160
You'd much rather sit at home
and eat pizza and play
computer games.

49:43.240 --> 49:46.720
So when it comes to
doing something
that requires bravado, like

49:46.800 --> 49:49.080
trying to kill someone,
for example,

49:49.160 --> 49:50.680
I don't think you were
up to it.

49:50.760 --> 49:52.280
FLORENCE: And in that moment,

49:52.360 --> 49:54.280
Daisy saw her
chance to escape.

49:54.360 --> 49:56.800
-She grabbed the knife and ran.
-Stay away.

49:57.360 --> 49:59.520
Stay back.

49:59.600 --> 50:02.480
But the question is, where,
or rather who,
did Daisy run to?

50:04.360 --> 50:07.000
You must have been
shocked when she arrived
at your house, Charlotte.

50:07.080 --> 50:09.120
Her arms bloody,
a knife in her hands.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.800
But as she told you
what happened,
I think you sensed

50:12.880 --> 50:15.000
an opportunity
presenting itself.

50:15.080 --> 50:18.000
An opportunity to deal with
two of your problems

50:18.080 --> 50:19.480
in one fell swoop.

50:19.560 --> 50:21.280
To get rid of the one person

50:21.360 --> 50:23.920
who knew about the money
you'd stolen from the club.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
JACK: And also to make
yourself financially
secure again.

50:27.080 --> 50:31.480
So you made your decision you
were going to finish the job
that Finn had started.

50:31.560 --> 50:33.160
JACK: So what did you do?
You grabbed your phone,

50:33.240 --> 50:35.800
and I assume,
under the pretence
of calling the police

50:35.880 --> 50:38.560
you pressed record
on the voice memo app.

50:40.200 --> 50:43.320
And I imagine poor,
trusting Daisy,
she had no idea

50:43.400 --> 50:45.200
-that her life was in danger...
-What are you dong?

50:45.280 --> 50:46.520
...until it was too late.

50:46.600 --> 50:48.080
Put the knife down.

50:48.160 --> 50:50.160
Please put it down.
Get off me.

50:50.240 --> 50:51.280
No!

51:00.680 --> 51:03.240
Next, you needed to find Finn.
Am I right, Finn?

51:04.120 --> 51:05.520
Finn, don't.

51:06.640 --> 51:08.280
I was headed home.

51:08.360 --> 51:10.040
FINN: I was desperate
to find Daisy,

51:10.680 --> 51:12.320
try and sort it.

51:12.400 --> 51:14.160
Charlotte was already
at the house waiting.

51:14.240 --> 51:16.320
She told me Daisy had
come to her.

51:16.400 --> 51:18.400
I told her how
I tried to kill her.

51:18.480 --> 51:21.000
Daisy was going to get me
arrested for attempted murder.

51:22.280 --> 51:26.000
And if she divorced me,
I'd be left with nothing.

51:26.080 --> 51:29.480
So then I take it she told you
she had sorted everything out.

51:32.320 --> 51:33.920
Daisy was no longer a problem.

51:35.080 --> 51:37.720
All you had to do
was play along.

51:37.800 --> 51:39.680
FLORENCE: And with
Finn committing to the plan,

51:39.760 --> 51:42.680
Charlotte, you moved on
to the next stage.

51:44.840 --> 51:46.520
Establishing your alibi.

51:46.600 --> 51:50.200
And seeing as you were
supposed to be at the
party at the yacht club,

51:50.280 --> 51:52.680
you decided that was where
you'd have to do it.

51:52.760 --> 51:55.880
But how to transport the body?

51:55.960 --> 51:58.760
JACK: So what were you
really up to the day
after the murder

51:58.840 --> 52:00.360
when we called around?

52:00.440 --> 52:03.360
You were cleaning, all right,
that's for sure,

52:03.440 --> 52:05.600
but it wasn't the boat
that you were interested in.

52:05.680 --> 52:08.160
It was the tarpaulin
that was bothering you.

52:08.240 --> 52:10.960
Because that's how you
transported the body,
isn't it?

52:11.040 --> 52:13.520
Which explains one
of the oddities
of this investigation.

52:13.600 --> 52:17.080
How come a long-dead butterfly
ended up at the crime scene?

52:17.160 --> 52:20.800
You see, it must have
crawled under the tarpaulin
many months previously,

52:20.880 --> 52:22.200
and died.

52:22.280 --> 52:24.360
But that afternoon, it got
rolled up with the body.

52:27.400 --> 52:29.600
It was then a simple matter

52:29.680 --> 52:31.440
to drive to the club
in Daisy's car,

52:35.240 --> 52:36.680
and straight to
the lookout point,

52:41.680 --> 52:44.920
where you dumped
the body before
returning to the clubhouse.

52:47.320 --> 52:51.760
We assume you hid
the tarpaulin somewhere
you could later retrieve it.

52:51.840 --> 52:54.520
JACK: All you had to do
then was establish
an apparent time of death.

52:54.600 --> 52:59.080
Easy enough for someone who
had the foresight to record
the whole murder.

52:59.160 --> 53:01.680
You'd already made
sure to bring
Daisy's phone with you.

53:01.760 --> 53:03.880
And you were wearing gloves
as part of your

53:03.960 --> 53:05.520
extravagant outfit.

53:05.600 --> 53:09.320
Now, it was just a question
of calling Finn with
Daisy's phone

53:09.400 --> 53:11.640
as previously arranged
with him,

53:11.720 --> 53:15.040
and when it went to voicemail,
pressing play on your own phone.

53:17.960 --> 53:21.480
And then all that was left
was for Finn to find us
and play the message.

53:21.560 --> 53:24.000
And for you to return
Daisy's phone to
her possession.

53:24.080 --> 53:27.160
It was you who steered
us toward Daisy's car
in the club car park

53:27.240 --> 53:28.440
while we were out looking
for her.

53:28.520 --> 53:31.200
And when we went to find it,
the car,

53:31.280 --> 53:34.400
I imagine you seized your moment
to nip back to Daisy's body

53:34.480 --> 53:36.000
and return the phone.

53:36.080 --> 53:39.040
HUGH: I don't understand.
Why would Charlotte do
all this for Finn?

53:39.120 --> 53:41.000
Why would she help him?

53:41.080 --> 53:44.400
It's an excellent question,
Hugh, and I think Finn
can help us to answer that.

53:48.320 --> 53:49.480
Money.

53:49.560 --> 53:51.280
She wanted money.

53:51.360 --> 53:52.480
A million pounds.

53:54.200 --> 53:56.720
JACK: Simple, really. Money.

53:56.800 --> 53:59.120
Boring old money,
that's what it boils down to.

53:59.200 --> 54:01.760
That's what Charlotte has
lived for most of her life,

54:01.840 --> 54:03.120
the luxuries it brings...

54:03.200 --> 54:04.800
Lovely place you've got here.

54:04.880 --> 54:06.240
The status it gives you.

54:06.320 --> 54:07.920
I have a reputation to uphold.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.200
You wanted back the
comfortable affluent life

54:10.280 --> 54:11.600
to which you'd
become accustomed.

54:11.680 --> 54:13.200
And you found a way to do it.

54:13.280 --> 54:15.560
By killing an entirely
innocent woman.

54:18.960 --> 54:20.200
Arrest them both, would you?

54:20.280 --> 54:22.880
Finn for attempted murder,

54:22.960 --> 54:24.400
Charlotte, full charge.

54:25.800 --> 54:27.040
You pathetic...

54:27.120 --> 54:29.360
Charlotte Hamilton,
I am arresting you for murder.

54:35.960 --> 54:37.560
It'll be good
to have him back, Florence.

54:37.640 --> 54:39.280
It really wasn't the same
without him.

54:39.360 --> 54:42.320
(CHUCKLES)
And I'm sure Harry agrees.

54:42.400 --> 54:43.880
Welcome home, buddy.

54:43.960 --> 54:45.080
You feeling better?

54:47.720 --> 54:50.320
I'll go get us
a couple of beers
to celebrate,

54:50.400 --> 54:52.360
give you both a moment.

54:55.200 --> 54:57.240
You know, you really had
me worried there.

54:57.320 --> 54:59.800
I know, it's probably my fault
for overfeeding you.

54:59.880 --> 55:02.880
But you don't have to eat
everything you see
on the plate, do you?

55:02.960 --> 55:04.960
Now, the vet says you gotta go
on a diet.

55:05.840 --> 55:06.880
Sorry.

55:07.840 --> 55:09.520
This is our little secret, okay?

55:10.600 --> 55:12.360
Go on, off you scuttle.

55:12.440 --> 55:13.800
Enjoy yourself.

55:16.080 --> 55:17.400
Here.

55:24.840 --> 55:26.480
You're right.

55:26.560 --> 55:29.640
Harry, he is a part of my life.

55:31.400 --> 55:34.080
I don't know when it happened,

55:34.160 --> 55:37.000
but I'm starting to feel
like I belong here.

55:37.800 --> 55:39.600
I think you do, sir.

55:52.400 --> 55:56.520
So this afternoon,
I want to focus on the
healing power of the breath.

55:56.600 --> 55:59.240
-Enjoy your swim, my love.
-Enjoy your meditation.

55:59.320 --> 56:00.840
-Daniel!
-Wait here.

56:00.920 --> 56:02.360
-He's dead.
-His belt,

56:02.440 --> 56:04.400
it's the exact same width
as the marks on his neck.

56:04.480 --> 56:06.000
This one. It's missing a belt.

56:06.080 --> 56:08.320
JACK: This speech I've got
to make for the commissioner's
award.

56:08.400 --> 56:10.080
Well, it's driving me mad.

56:10.160 --> 56:11.960
How am I supposed to make
a speech about someone
I hardly know?

56:12.040 --> 56:14.840
Believe by Daniel Friend.
It's really fascinating.

56:14.920 --> 56:17.360
It says that if there's
something you want in life,

56:17.440 --> 56:20.040
there are these visualisation
exercises you can use.

56:20.120 --> 56:23.880
I'm just trying to get a
sense of you as a civilian,
as well as a commissioner.

56:23.960 --> 56:25.720
What do you look like
when you take off
your uniform?

56:25.800 --> 56:26.840
Excuse me?

56:26.920 --> 56:28.320
If I close my eyes,

56:28.400 --> 56:30.760
and I visualise Tino
walking around the bend,

56:30.840 --> 56:32.200
what I've willed to happen

56:32.280 --> 56:33.640
should actually happen.

56:35.440 --> 56:37.120
Maybe you should try
another book.

56:37.200 --> 56:39.160
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
