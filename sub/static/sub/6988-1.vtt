01:27.679 --> 01:31.600
My God.
Brother, what have you done?

01:47.324 --> 01:52.371
Yet again we arrive to witness
this monster's aftermath.

01:54.373 --> 01:57.543
I will not tolerate this
any longer, Marcus.

01:57.709 --> 01:59.962
Your brother must be stopped.

02:00.504 --> 02:02.214
It ends tonight.

02:02.589 --> 02:05.884
We must move quickly,
before they turn.

02:08.887 --> 02:10.639
Is he still here?

02:11.223 --> 02:12.724
Yes.

02:12.891 --> 02:15.727
Viktor, he must not be harmed.

02:15.894 --> 02:18.063
I gave you my word, did I not?

02:18.230 --> 02:21.149
But William must be controlled.

02:24.361 --> 02:25.696
Burn the bodies.

02:25.863 --> 02:27.823
Search the outbuildings.

02:27.990 --> 02:29.992
Form two groups.
You, douse them with fuel.

02:30.158 --> 02:31.660
- Yes, sir.
- Marcus.

02:32.744 --> 02:34.496
Stay with me.

03:14.953 --> 03:16.830
Give me the torch.

03:21.418 --> 03:22.961
They're turning!

03:25.130 --> 03:26.423
They're turning!

05:01.935 --> 05:05.063
- Retreat to the woods.
- I'll stay and fight. You need my help.

05:05.355 --> 05:06.982
I need you alive.

05:07.149 --> 05:08.483
If you die, we all die.

05:08.650 --> 05:09.818
Now, go.

05:10.527 --> 05:11.862
Go!

05:36.636 --> 05:38.472
- We found him.
- And?

05:38.638 --> 05:41.183
- We need more men.
- Find Amelia.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.486
Amelia, we found William.

06:18.845 --> 06:20.639
Surround him!

06:23.642 --> 06:25.519
Take him down.

06:33.819 --> 06:35.195
No.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.990
Leave him be.

06:42.369 --> 06:44.121
Stop this, you're killing him.

06:47.457 --> 06:48.667
More!

07:13.108 --> 07:14.568
William.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.027
Marcus!

07:17.988 --> 07:19.406
He was not to be harmed.

07:19.823 --> 07:21.908
Place him in my charge
as we agreed...

07:22.075 --> 07:24.077
...or you will pay for your deceit.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.955
And you will learn your place.

07:27.122 --> 07:30.125
Your sympathy for this beast
is foolish.

07:30.292 --> 07:33.086
Your brother is entirely
beyond control.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.838
It will be done my way.

07:35.005 --> 07:38.508
You know well the consequences
if you murder me...

07:38.675 --> 07:39.926
...or William.

07:40.093 --> 07:43.555
If you so much as speak
his name again...

07:43.722 --> 07:46.141
...you will have chosen
that future for him.

07:54.608 --> 07:58.612
What is thy will, my lord?

07:59.404 --> 08:02.824
Imprisonment for all time.

08:03.658 --> 08:06.286
Far from you.

08:15.879 --> 08:20.342
For six centuries I was a loyal soldier
of the Vampire clan.

08:22.719 --> 08:24.554
But I was betrayed.

08:25.931 --> 08:29.100
The war was not as it had seemed.

08:29.434 --> 08:34.147
In one night, the lies that had united
our kind had been exposed.

08:34.773 --> 08:37.107
Kraven, our second-in-command...

08:37.275 --> 08:39.778
...had formed a secret alliance
with Lucian...

08:39.945 --> 08:41.988
...ruler of the Werewolf clan...

08:42.447 --> 08:44.699
...to overthrow Viktor, our leader.

08:46.159 --> 08:49.204
But Kraven's lust for power
and domination had failed.

08:51.498 --> 08:54.709
Viktor was not the savior
I had been led to believe.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.297
He had betrayed us all.

09:06.304 --> 09:09.474
Soon the hunt will be on
for his killer.

09:12.978 --> 09:15.730
I have but one ally left:

09:15.897 --> 09:17.524
Michael...

09:17.691 --> 09:20.360
...the human descendant
of Corvinus.

09:21.236 --> 09:23.613
Neither Vampire nor Lycan...

09:23.780 --> 09:25.615
...but a hybrid.

09:28.285 --> 09:30.954
It's only a matter of time
before we're found.

09:53.476 --> 09:56.563
My only hope now
is to awaken Marcus...

09:56.730 --> 09:59.149
...our last remaining elder...

09:59.316 --> 10:01.026
...and expose the truth...

10:01.192 --> 10:05.655
...before Kraven tries to murder him
while he's still in hibernation.

10:07.490 --> 10:10.869
Kraven knows
he's no match for him awake.

10:48.615 --> 10:49.908
Perfect.

11:23.441 --> 11:25.360
This thing's been dead for weeks.

11:25.527 --> 11:28.238
I thought Lycans went back
to their human form when they die.

11:28.405 --> 11:30.949
They do. It's been given
a serum to stop regression...

11:31.116 --> 11:32.951
...so it can be studied.

11:33.118 --> 11:34.327
How can you tell?

11:42.293 --> 11:44.212
Not quite your department, I guess.

11:44.379 --> 11:47.799
I just killed them. I didn't pay
much attention to their anatomy.

11:48.967 --> 11:51.094
- How long can we stay here?
- Not long.

11:51.261 --> 11:53.805
These safe houses are
linked together on one mainframe...

11:53.972 --> 11:56.558
...with motion sensors revealing
which ones are active.

11:56.724 --> 11:59.102
Someone could have
picked us up already.

12:07.068 --> 12:09.320
There's only about an hour
till daylight.

12:09.654 --> 12:11.948
Can you make it back
to the mansion before sunrise?

12:12.115 --> 12:14.826
- Just.
- Okay, let's get what we need and go.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.995
No.

12:18.246 --> 12:20.123
I'm going alone.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.102
Open it.

14:26.499 --> 14:27.750
Marcus?

14:27.917 --> 14:32.797
The blood memories
of this wretched creature...

14:33.798 --> 14:39.095
...have shown me that your treachery
knows no bounds.

14:40.054 --> 14:42.932
My lord, I can explain.

14:43.308 --> 14:46.644
Why would I listen to your lies...

14:46.811 --> 14:49.772
...when the journey to the truth...

14:53.443 --> 14:56.237
...is so much sweeter?

15:03.786 --> 15:06.789
I kept his secrets,
cleaned up the mess.

15:07.832 --> 15:09.125
You'll go before Viktor...

15:09.542 --> 15:11.669
...and tell him
exactly what I tell you to!

15:13.046 --> 15:15.423
You just concentrate on your part.

15:25.850 --> 15:27.060
Please.

15:27.852 --> 15:30.188
I can assist you.

15:30.355 --> 15:32.565
Oh, you already have.

15:39.530 --> 15:40.823
If I can plead my case...

15:40.990 --> 15:43.117
...there's a chance
you'll be granted sanctuary.

15:43.284 --> 15:46.204
Right now, you'll be killed on sight.
I'm not prepared to risk it.

15:46.371 --> 15:47.789
What am I supposed to do, wait?

15:47.955 --> 15:50.667
Kraven may still have men with him.
You're not going alone.

15:50.833 --> 15:52.710
You're not as strong
as you might think.

15:52.877 --> 15:55.546
- What?
- Michael, you're unique.

15:55.713 --> 15:57.757
There's never been a hybrid before.

15:57.924 --> 16:01.552
However ambivalent you feel about it,
your powers could be limitless.

16:01.719 --> 16:02.970
But you depend on blood.

16:03.429 --> 16:05.264
You need to feed.

16:05.431 --> 16:09.018
Without it, you'll be growing weaker
by the second. Use the time for that.

16:09.394 --> 16:11.229
Jesus Christ.

16:12.146 --> 16:13.981
And what if I don't?

16:14.232 --> 16:15.692
What if I can't?

16:15.858 --> 16:17.777
Normal food could be lethal.

16:17.944 --> 16:20.780
If you don't anticipate your cravings,
you will attack humans.

16:20.947 --> 16:24.117
And believe me, you don't want that
on your conscience.

16:24.909 --> 16:26.744
There really is
no going back, Michael.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.040
I'm sorry.

16:31.457 --> 16:33.668
Look, I understand what you did.

16:33.835 --> 16:35.628
I'm grateful.

16:36.671 --> 16:38.798
You saved my life.

16:39.382 --> 16:40.675
I wasn't ready to die.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.265
I don't know.

16:47.432 --> 16:48.599
Everything's changed.

16:49.058 --> 16:51.519
I probably need a minute
to make it all fit in my head.

16:51.686 --> 16:53.813
It's a lot to process all at once.

16:55.773 --> 16:58.693
Look, go. I'll be here.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.779
You just make sure you come back.

18:26.989 --> 18:28.282
Sir.

18:28.449 --> 18:30.910
The innocent who witnessed...

18:31.077 --> 18:32.411
...they've been silenced?

18:32.829 --> 18:35.164
But otherwise unharmed,
as ordered.

18:39.377 --> 18:41.963
- Show me what you have.
- Yes, sir.

18:47.218 --> 18:48.886
Two Death Dealers were killed.

18:49.053 --> 18:50.930
We found no Lycan bodies.

18:51.138 --> 18:53.558
Apparently they were using
a new kind of ammunition...

18:53.724 --> 18:55.685
...some sort of UV round.

18:56.853 --> 18:57.979
Amelia?

19:00.731 --> 19:01.983
No one survived.

19:02.149 --> 19:04.569
It seems Kraven's men
might have been present...

19:04.735 --> 19:07.572
...but they did nothing to prevent it.

19:07.864 --> 19:09.615
And Viktor?

19:29.886 --> 19:33.139
And no trace of Marcus
amongst the ashes?

19:33.306 --> 19:36.058
It seems he destroyed
his own coven, sir.

19:37.268 --> 19:39.437
It was never his coven.

20:04.211 --> 20:05.588
We need to go.

20:49.090 --> 20:51.175
Give me a moment.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.440
There you are.

24:13.711 --> 24:15.296
How you doing?

24:36.609 --> 24:38.235
Thank you.

26:00.192 --> 26:02.653
You've got to get away from me.

26:04.071 --> 26:05.489
Get away from me!

26:17.668 --> 26:19.003
Hello?

26:25.301 --> 26:26.677
There.

26:28.929 --> 26:30.180
Michael Corvin.

26:30.347 --> 26:31.682
Get the men up there. Now.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.194
Get the fuck away from me.

27:10.471 --> 27:11.722
Stop. Stop.

27:17.436 --> 27:18.729
Shit.

28:44.690 --> 28:47.693
Michael. Oh, shit.

28:54.658 --> 28:57.369
- Here. Take it.
- No.

28:57.536 --> 28:59.621
Michael, you'll die.

29:25.189 --> 29:26.982
Shit.

29:27.232 --> 29:29.026
Can you move?

29:33.363 --> 29:34.656
We need to go.

29:55.594 --> 29:56.845
Marcus.

29:57.012 --> 29:59.515
I know what you've done, Selene.

30:00.098 --> 30:02.643
Viktor deserved his fate
and Kraven was no better.

30:02.809 --> 30:07.981
Kraven has already reaped
the rewards of his own misdeeds.

30:08.524 --> 30:09.983
And Viktor...

30:10.359 --> 30:12.861
Viktor deserved his fate...

30:13.028 --> 30:14.446
...many times over.

30:16.073 --> 30:18.075
A terrible business...

30:18.242 --> 30:20.118
...the slaying of your family.

30:21.286 --> 30:23.330
Yet so much effort was spent...

30:23.497 --> 30:25.791
...to conceal this matter from me.

30:27.876 --> 30:31.004
What do you suppose
Viktor had to hide?

30:31.964 --> 30:35.259
Or perhaps it is you, Selene...

30:37.219 --> 30:40.931
...as the last
of your wretched family...

30:41.640 --> 30:43.976
...who has something to hide.

30:53.569 --> 30:55.028
Go!

31:30.480 --> 31:31.732
Get in.

32:39.633 --> 32:43.303
Dead or alive,
you will give me what I want.

33:56.334 --> 33:58.044
You okay?

34:01.840 --> 34:04.217
- He's a hybrid, isn't he?
- Yes.

34:05.343 --> 34:07.679
He wanted this. Why?

34:08.804 --> 34:10.474
I don't know.

34:10.639 --> 34:12.851
But we have another problem.

34:18.023 --> 34:19.274
Turn off up here.

34:25.030 --> 34:27.072
Shit. All right, get down.

34:28.158 --> 34:30.159
Keep your foot on the gas,
but stay down.

34:45.926 --> 34:47.761
Hold on.

35:02.442 --> 35:04.110
Stay down.

35:58.707 --> 36:00.208
Come on.

36:17.767 --> 36:19.269
Give me your hand.

36:19.436 --> 36:20.979
Jesus Christ.

36:22.606 --> 36:24.441
There's really no need.

36:24.608 --> 36:26.276
I'll be right back.

36:42.959 --> 36:44.169
All right, let me see.

36:49.090 --> 36:50.717
See?

36:50.884 --> 36:52.510
No need.

40:40.655 --> 40:41.906
Area secure, sir.

42:09.619 --> 42:11.037
Sun's setting.

42:13.039 --> 42:14.457
What's wrong?

42:21.339 --> 42:24.092
The supplies were taken.
Used weapons were left behind.

42:24.467 --> 42:27.637
The tavern events occurred before
dawn, so they couldn't have got far.

42:27.804 --> 42:30.598
Remain airborne for the moment.
I'm sure they'll reappear...

42:30.765 --> 42:33.393
...in good time.
- Yes, sir.

42:37.647 --> 42:40.525
I've seen this before,
when I was a child.

42:40.692 --> 42:42.277
I've held it.

42:42.443 --> 42:43.987
When it was open, like this.

42:44.153 --> 42:45.405
How is that possible?

42:47.657 --> 42:49.409
I don't know.

42:51.703 --> 42:53.329
But I know someone that might.

42:54.038 --> 42:56.040
Andreas Tanis.

42:56.207 --> 42:59.085
He was the official historian
of the covens.

43:01.546 --> 43:05.341
He fell from favor after documenting
what Viktor considered malicious lies.

43:05.508 --> 43:08.261
Of course, as it turns out,
he was probably telling the truth.

43:08.428 --> 43:09.762
What happened to him?

43:09.929 --> 43:12.056
He was exiled over 300 years ago.

43:12.682 --> 43:14.183
Three hundred years?

43:14.350 --> 43:16.144
What makes you think
we'll find him now?

43:16.519 --> 43:17.979
I was the one who exiled him.

43:57.477 --> 43:59.103
Looks like a monastery.

43:59.270 --> 44:01.356
It used to be.
More like a prison now.

44:01.981 --> 44:04.442
Tanis has been hiding there
since Viktor's order.

44:04.609 --> 44:07.195
We'll be the first people
he's seen in centuries.

44:19.082 --> 44:21.167
- That's odd.
- What?

44:21.709 --> 44:24.337
I don't remember this gate
being here before.

44:26.589 --> 44:27.965
Take this.

45:33.322 --> 45:34.740
Shit.

45:58.347 --> 45:59.515
Go back!

46:01.893 --> 46:03.186
Gotcha.

46:06.189 --> 46:07.273
Fuck.

48:41.427 --> 48:43.596
I knew it was you, Selene.

48:44.055 --> 48:47.350
The stench of Viktor's blood
still lingers in your veins.

48:47.516 --> 48:49.018
Tanis.

48:49.185 --> 48:50.936
I see your aim hasn't improved.

48:53.189 --> 48:55.399
You haven't changed.

48:55.566 --> 48:57.318
You don't scare me, Selene.

48:58.361 --> 49:00.237
Well, we're gonna
have to work on that.

49:10.373 --> 49:11.749
We need to talk.

49:15.878 --> 49:18.506
Your exile seems a bit more
comfortable than I remember.

49:19.382 --> 49:21.300
How does a Vampire
have Lycan bodyguards?

49:21.801 --> 49:22.927
A gift.

49:23.094 --> 49:24.720
From a most persuasive client.

49:25.888 --> 49:27.264
Lucian.

49:29.016 --> 49:30.559
Why would Lucian
wanna protect you?

49:32.228 --> 49:33.771
Because he was trading with them.

49:35.898 --> 49:37.942
UV rounds.

49:38.109 --> 49:40.778
How long have you been
in the business of killing your own?

49:41.112 --> 49:44.073
I've done what's necessary
to survive.

49:44.240 --> 49:48.577
My decision was made easy the day
your precious Viktor betrayed me.

49:48.744 --> 49:51.580
Betrayal was something
he did very well.

49:52.915 --> 49:55.668
Viktor's dead. I killed him.

49:55.835 --> 49:57.253
You?

49:57.420 --> 49:59.213
Kill Viktor?

50:03.259 --> 50:05.261
No, I think not.

50:07.430 --> 50:09.390
Oh, unless you've learned the truth.

50:14.729 --> 50:17.314
So your eyes are finally open.

50:18.065 --> 50:20.359
Isn't it interesting how the truth...

50:20.526 --> 50:22.903
...is even harder to absorb
than light?

50:23.070 --> 50:25.281
You know, I tried to stop him,
of course.

50:25.448 --> 50:28.409
A travesty,
committing such a horrible crime.

50:29.452 --> 50:31.662
And then turning you.

50:31.829 --> 50:33.956
That was too much to take.

50:34.165 --> 50:36.500
My protests are why he put me here.

50:37.460 --> 50:39.587
Careful with that, dear.

50:39.754 --> 50:40.963
Makes a terrible bang.

50:42.298 --> 50:43.841
Open the blades and they're active.

50:44.550 --> 50:46.510
Good to know.

50:50.598 --> 50:53.100
Viktor put you here for a reason,
but I doubt it was...

50:53.267 --> 50:55.603
...because you had moral qualms.

50:55.770 --> 50:59.815
- What do you know?
- Very little of anything, I'm afraid.

51:06.113 --> 51:09.408
Well, then, perhaps I'm mistaken
and there's no use for you at all.

51:10.659 --> 51:12.787
Marcus was after this. Why?

51:57.498 --> 52:00.334
Some history is based on truth...

52:00.501 --> 52:02.628
...and others on deception.

52:04.421 --> 52:08.050
Viktor was not the first of our kind,
as you were led to believe.

52:08.217 --> 52:10.177
He was once human...

52:10.344 --> 52:12.555
...the ruler of these lands.

52:14.056 --> 52:15.850
Marcus...

52:16.475 --> 52:18.394
...he's the one.

52:20.145 --> 52:21.480
The source.

52:22.731 --> 52:24.733
The first true Vampire.

52:25.234 --> 52:27.611
So the legend is true.

52:28.237 --> 52:31.574
Toward the end of his ruthless life...

52:32.575 --> 52:36.745
...when the next breath meant more
to Viktor than silver or gold...

52:36.912 --> 52:39.790
...Marcus came with an offer...

52:39.957 --> 52:43.752
...a reprieve from sickness
and death.

52:44.712 --> 52:46.255
Immortality.

52:46.422 --> 52:50.009
And in return, Viktor was to use
his army-turned-immortal to help him.

52:51.010 --> 52:52.678
To do what?

52:52.845 --> 52:55.097
To defeat
the very first Werewolves...

52:55.264 --> 52:58.309
...a dangerous
and infectious breed...

52:58.475 --> 53:01.103
...created by Marcus' own
flesh and blood:

53:03.105 --> 53:04.732
His twin brother, William.

53:06.775 --> 53:08.402
But these weren't
the Lycans we know.

53:08.736 --> 53:10.988
Disgusting though
your brethren may be...

53:11.155 --> 53:13.157
...they at least are evolved.

53:13.324 --> 53:15.618
No, these were raging monsters.

53:15.784 --> 53:19.121
Never able to take
human form again.

53:19.288 --> 53:22.458
It was only later generations
that learned to channel their rage.

53:22.625 --> 53:26.378
And William's appetite for destruction
and rampage was insatiable.

53:27.630 --> 53:29.089
He had to be stopped.

53:29.256 --> 53:31.717
And so once Viktor's army
was turned...

53:31.884 --> 53:34.303
...the legions of Vampires
under his control...

53:34.470 --> 53:37.723
...tracked down
and destroyed the animals...

53:37.890 --> 53:39.224
...then captured William...

53:39.808 --> 53:41.310
...and locked him away.

53:41.810 --> 53:43.979
Viktor's prisoner for all time.

53:46.649 --> 53:47.900
Why let him live?

53:48.067 --> 53:52.363
For the very same reason that Viktor
never conspired against Marcus: Fear.

53:52.780 --> 53:54.823
He was warned that,
should Marcus be killed...

53:55.282 --> 53:58.327
...all those in his bloodline
would follow him to the grave.

53:59.370 --> 54:01.330
So in Viktor's mind...

54:01.497 --> 54:04.249
...William's death would mean
the end for all Lycans...

54:04.416 --> 54:05.542
...his slaves.

54:07.586 --> 54:09.046
Yes.

54:10.255 --> 54:12.383
Yes, a clever deception...

54:12.549 --> 54:15.344
...but one Viktor was hardly willing
to put to the test.

54:16.679 --> 54:18.681
And so Marcus was protected...

54:19.014 --> 54:21.100
...at all costs.

54:24.353 --> 54:25.604
Yes, here we are.

54:31.360 --> 54:33.862
- Vampires?
- Mortals.

54:34.989 --> 54:38.033
Men loyal to Alexander Corvinus.

54:39.868 --> 54:41.203
The father of us all.

54:49.211 --> 54:50.546
What's this?

54:54.383 --> 54:56.010
You should know.

54:57.219 --> 54:59.013
It's William's prison.

55:01.223 --> 55:04.977
The prison your father
was commissioned to build.

55:10.524 --> 55:13.652
So you've been the one keeping
a watch over this for me, have you?

55:13.819 --> 55:16.113
I've been searching everywhere
for this, my darling.

55:21.076 --> 55:22.327
What is it?

55:22.995 --> 55:24.246
What's wrong?

55:25.414 --> 55:28.292
She now understands
why her family was killed.

55:31.253 --> 55:33.630
But that was many years later.

55:34.923 --> 55:36.800
The winter of Lucian's escape.

55:36.967 --> 55:39.011
Your father knew too much.

55:39.178 --> 55:40.971
Or too much for Viktor to risk...

55:41.472 --> 55:43.265
...especially when Lucian...

55:44.224 --> 55:47.561
...had the key to William's cell.

55:48.562 --> 55:50.439
And I'm the map.

55:51.273 --> 55:52.816
Yes.

55:53.817 --> 55:58.363
The only one still living
who has seen its location.

55:59.281 --> 56:02.117
Oh, Viktor realized you'd be too young
to remember explicitly...

56:02.284 --> 56:05.537
...but Marcus knows
that the memory...

56:05.704 --> 56:09.374
...and therefore the exact location
of William's prison...

56:09.833 --> 56:11.710
...is hidden away in your blood.

56:13.045 --> 56:15.422
Why is Marcus looking
for him now...

56:15.589 --> 56:17.174
...after all this time?

56:17.549 --> 56:18.759
That I cannot answer.

56:29.978 --> 56:31.605
But I do know someone...

56:31.814 --> 56:34.650
...who could stop him.
Perhaps I could arrange a meeting.

56:36.235 --> 56:40.614
In exchange for your discretion,
of course.

56:41.865 --> 56:43.367
Of course.

57:38.380 --> 57:41.341
Tanis. You seem anxious.

57:42.050 --> 57:44.344
Why do you flee
the very sight of me?

57:49.766 --> 57:50.976
Please...

57:52.060 --> 57:53.562
...sit.

57:54.897 --> 57:57.691
There's no need
for this to be unpleasant.

57:58.859 --> 58:01.361
I've always rather enjoyed
your company.

58:07.284 --> 58:09.453
Now you're being rude.

58:10.746 --> 58:12.247
Sorry.

58:20.422 --> 58:22.549
Viktor struck two keys.

58:23.091 --> 58:24.509
What do you know of them?

58:26.595 --> 58:28.180
Keys?

58:29.097 --> 58:32.059
I don't know of any keys.

58:47.616 --> 58:49.534
Oh, yes.

58:49.701 --> 58:51.245
Yes, those keys.

58:51.620 --> 58:54.581
- Yes?
- Well, one was...

58:56.083 --> 58:58.877
One was kept in plain sight...

58:59.044 --> 59:01.296
...draped around
his daughter's neck...

59:02.005 --> 59:04.508
...right there for you to see.
- And the other?

59:07.177 --> 59:10.180
- Kept with Viktor at all times.
- Where?

59:11.223 --> 59:12.975
Within him.

59:14.309 --> 59:15.978
Beneath the flesh.

59:22.359 --> 59:24.319
Please. Please.

59:24.486 --> 59:25.654
I beg you. Please.

59:25.862 --> 59:27.739
Please, I beg you.

59:44.298 --> 59:46.883
- Who could stop him.
Perhaps I could arrange a meeting.

59:47.050 --> 59:49.553
Go to pier 17.
Ask for Lorenz Macaro.

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:16.204
How do we know Tanis
isn't setting us up?

01:00:16.371 --> 01:00:18.832
He's not brave enough
to set me up.

01:00:44.608 --> 01:00:45.984
You can go.

01:00:56.411 --> 01:00:58.121
You're familiar with this, then?

01:01:06.046 --> 01:01:07.339
Intimately.

01:01:14.596 --> 01:01:16.515
You're Alexander Corvinus.

01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:26.149
There was a time
that I was known by that name.

01:01:27.526 --> 01:01:30.904
By any name,
I am still your forefather.

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:40.330
How have you stayed hidden
all these years?

01:01:40.497 --> 01:01:42.916
For centuries I've stood by
and watched the havoc...

01:01:43.083 --> 01:01:48.088
...my sons have wrought upon
each other and upon humanity.

01:01:49.297 --> 01:01:51.133
Not the legacy I prayed for...

01:01:51.299 --> 01:01:53.593
...the morning I watched them
enter this world.

01:01:54.845 --> 01:01:57.055
And a tiresome duty...

01:01:57.222 --> 01:02:00.434
...keeping the war contained,
cleaning up the mess...

01:02:01.435 --> 01:02:04.771
...hiding my family's
unfortunate history.

01:02:04.938 --> 01:02:07.274
- Couldn't you have stopped it?
- Yes.

01:02:08.525 --> 01:02:10.652
Could you kill your own sons?

01:02:10.819 --> 01:02:13.155
You know what Marcus will do.

01:02:13.321 --> 01:02:16.408
If he finds me,
he finds William's prison.

01:02:16.575 --> 01:02:18.743
You need to help us stop him.

01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:23.915
You are asking me
to help you kill my son?

01:02:24.082 --> 01:02:25.500
You?

01:02:25.667 --> 01:02:27.169
A Death Dealer?

01:02:27.502 --> 01:02:29.337
How many innocents did you kill...

01:02:29.504 --> 01:02:32.299
...in the six-century quest
to avenge your family?

01:02:32.466 --> 01:02:34.843
Spare me
your self-righteous declarations.

01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:40.098
You are no different from Marcus
and even less noble than William.

01:02:40.265 --> 01:02:43.018
At least he cannot control
his savagery.

01:02:43.185 --> 01:02:46.313
Anything I've done
can be laid at your feet.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:49.608
Hundreds of thousands have died
because of your inability to accept...

01:02:49.774 --> 01:02:52.819
...that your sons are monsters,
that they create monsters.

01:02:53.653 --> 01:02:55.155
You could've stopped all of this.

01:02:55.322 --> 01:02:57.073
Do not come groveling to me...

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.952
...simply because you are weaker
than your adversary.

01:03:01.119 --> 01:03:03.997
You know the devastation William
caused before he was captured.

01:03:04.164 --> 01:03:05.540
He cannot be set free.

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:56.925
Wa- No, wait.
You're no match for him.

01:04:19.781 --> 01:04:21.032
Soon, brother.

01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:57.360
No.

01:05:09.247 --> 01:05:10.749
Father.

01:05:11.166 --> 01:05:12.250
No.

01:05:13.668 --> 01:05:16.212
They've gone.
There, there, my child.

01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:17.881
You are safe now.

01:06:06.554 --> 01:06:09.057
No. Michael.

01:06:09.766 --> 01:06:11.059
Look at me.

01:06:13.311 --> 01:06:14.896
Michael.

01:06:15.397 --> 01:06:16.648
Shit.

01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:44.300
Please.

01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:47.971
Please.

01:06:56.938 --> 01:06:58.523
Come on.

01:06:59.023 --> 01:07:00.734
Come on.

01:07:04.279 --> 01:07:06.281
Fuck.

01:07:52.494 --> 01:07:53.828
Hello, Father.

01:07:54.412 --> 01:07:57.457
You are unwelcome in my presence.

01:08:00.251 --> 01:08:04.214
The predictable heart
that never thaws.

01:08:04.839 --> 01:08:08.134
Pity it beats within such a fool.

01:08:09.093 --> 01:08:10.887
The eldest of the immortals...

01:08:11.346 --> 01:08:15.308
...yet you have made no attempt
to seize your destiny.

01:08:15.475 --> 01:08:20.854
We are oddities of nature, you and I.
Nothing more.

01:08:21.022 --> 01:08:23.608
This is a world for humanity.

01:08:23.774 --> 01:08:27.946
And that petty sentiment explains
why you rejected your sons?

01:08:28.112 --> 01:08:30.615
Why you stood by
for over half a millennium...

01:08:30.782 --> 01:08:34.368
...as William suffered alone
in darkness?

01:08:34.868 --> 01:08:36.871
No, Father.

01:08:37.497 --> 01:08:40.875
I have no respect
for your petty sentiment.

01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:45.587
Viktor's key. Where is it?

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:48.550
Whatever plan you have
for William is futile.

01:08:48.716 --> 01:08:51.886
- You cannot control your brother.
- Oh, I am stronger now.

01:08:52.053 --> 01:08:55.473
And our bond is greater than you
have ever wanted to acknowledge.

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:56.975
You're wrong.

01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:00.395
Soon you'll be drowning in Lycans,
just like before.

01:09:00.562 --> 01:09:02.229
Oh, not Lycans, Father...

01:09:02.604 --> 01:09:04.524
...or Vampires.

01:09:04.691 --> 01:09:09.237
A new race, created in
the image of their maker...

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:11.948
...their new god:

01:09:14.908 --> 01:09:16.911
Me.

01:09:28.798 --> 01:09:31.301
And a true god...

01:09:35.971 --> 01:09:37.640
...has no father.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.637
You will fail.

01:10:51.464 --> 01:10:53.216
- Get the kit.
- No.

01:11:00.556 --> 01:11:03.851
Please, sir, let us help you.

01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:06.354
The time has come, my friend.

01:11:07.939 --> 01:11:09.482
Find the girl.

01:11:10.858 --> 01:11:12.986
Bring her to me.

01:11:18.449 --> 01:11:19.784
No, wait. Wait.

01:11:23.413 --> 01:11:26.582
If you want Marcus,
you'll need Alexander's help.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.382
Don't leave him here.

01:11:55.028 --> 01:11:58.740
- Did he get the pendant?
- Yes.

01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:02.160
He's too powerful for you alone.

01:12:02.702 --> 01:12:04.787
You are the only one
older than he is...

01:12:04.954 --> 01:12:06.956
...the only one stronger.

01:12:07.123 --> 01:12:09.542
You could have killed him yourself.

01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:13.755
No matter what he's become...

01:12:15.131 --> 01:12:16.549
...he is my son.

01:12:22.847 --> 01:12:25.641
You are the last hope left.

01:12:26.559 --> 01:12:29.896
There is only one way
to defeat him.

01:12:37.195 --> 01:12:39.280
Quickly, now...

01:12:39.447 --> 01:12:43.451
...before there is no more legacy
left in my veins.

01:12:51.959 --> 01:12:54.128
What will I become?

01:12:55.922 --> 01:12:57.590
The future.

01:13:40.258 --> 01:13:42.218
Go now.

01:17:29.737 --> 01:17:31.238
We're getting close.

01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:28.712
Head back around
towards the river.

01:18:40.724 --> 01:18:42.852
I don't see a way inside.

01:18:45.104 --> 01:18:47.356
There used to be
a river entrance just there.

01:18:47.523 --> 01:18:49.608
It must be submerged now.

01:18:49.775 --> 01:18:51.277
Looks like we're getting wet.

01:19:27.605 --> 01:19:29.190
Closer.

01:19:34.778 --> 01:19:36.363
Selene.

01:20:49.562 --> 01:20:50.896
William.

01:21:06.370 --> 01:21:07.913
Wait.

01:21:12.918 --> 01:21:14.420
No, William. Stop.

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:16.547
Be still, brother.

01:21:16.714 --> 01:21:18.215
It's me.

01:21:21.844 --> 01:21:24.555
I'd no sooner harm you than myself.

01:21:57.004 --> 01:21:58.255
Which way?

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.035
Is this it?

01:22:32.289 --> 01:22:34.208
He's already here.

01:23:07.991 --> 01:23:09.743
What is that?

01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:13.163
Nothing. Let's go.

01:23:24.216 --> 01:23:26.385
We're too late.

01:23:53.954 --> 01:23:55.581
- After him.
- Get behind him.

01:24:04.965 --> 01:24:06.633
Impressive.

01:25:15.536 --> 01:25:17.037
Michael, you're unique.

01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:22.209
There's never been
a hybrid before.

01:25:23.293 --> 01:25:25.087
Your powers could be limitless.

01:25:42.521 --> 01:25:44.773
Hold it! Oh, fuck.

01:25:48.485 --> 01:25:51.280
- Where is he?
- He went right through there.

01:25:52.948 --> 01:25:55.742
All we have are UV rounds.
They won't take him down.

01:25:55.909 --> 01:25:58.412
No, but they'll slow him down.

01:26:44.666 --> 01:26:46.335
Let's go.

01:26:46.835 --> 01:26:48.086
You all right?

01:28:04.955 --> 01:28:06.707
Jesus Christ!

01:29:58.652 --> 01:30:00.237
But these weren't
the Lycans we know.

01:30:00.403 --> 01:30:01.780
No, these were raging monsters.

01:30:01.947 --> 01:30:04.116
Unable to take human form
ever again.

01:30:54.541 --> 01:30:56.459
What are you waiting for?
Shoot them.

01:30:56.626 --> 01:30:59.379
I can't. Not without taking her out.

01:30:59.546 --> 01:31:00.755
I can't get a shot.

01:31:52.474 --> 01:31:53.767
Michael.

01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:32.138
Take her down.

01:33:04.379 --> 01:33:05.380
Cut us loose!

01:33:09.134 --> 01:33:10.844
We're going down!

01:34:50.443 --> 01:34:51.903
William!

01:35:02.497 --> 01:35:06.459
I knew Viktor made a mistake
by keeping you as a pet.

01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:10.338
He should have killed you
with the rest of your family.

01:37:58.673 --> 01:38:01.801
An unknown chapter lies ahead.

01:38:01.968 --> 01:38:05.263
The lines that had divided the clans
have now been blurred.

01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:08.391
Chaos and infighting are inevitable.

01:38:08.558 --> 01:38:12.145
All that is certain is that darkness
is still ahead.

01:38:12.312 --> 01:38:16.107
But for now, for the first time...

01:38:16.274 --> 01:38:19.152
...I look into the light with new hope.

01:38:20.305 --> 01:38:26.713
