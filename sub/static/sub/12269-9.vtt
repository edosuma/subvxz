WEBVTT

00:02.303 --> 00:03.474
(Emily) MY FATHER
 WAS AN INNOCENT MAN,

00:03.474 --> 00:05.136
DESTROYED BY POWERFUL PEOPLE.

00:05.136 --> 00:07.138
THE GRAYSONS ARE BEHIND THIS,
AND THEY'RE GONNA PAY.

00:07.138 --> 00:10.211
I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE
 TO AVENGING HIS DEATH...

00:10.211 --> 00:11.682
EVENTUALLY, SOMEONE'S
GONNA FIND YOU OUT.

00:11.682 --> 00:15.386
AND I WON'T STOP UNTIL
 THEY'VE ALL PAID THE PRICE.

00:15.386 --> 00:18.049
I'VE BEEN COLLECTING NAMES
OF GRAYSON GLOBAL EMPLOYEES.

00:18.049 --> 00:20.391
ONE OF THEM WILL BE WILLING
TO SHARE THEIR ACCOUNT.

00:20.391 --> 00:22.223
THANKS FOR MEETING WITH ME,
MS. DAVIS.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.454
IT'S LYDIA.

00:23.454 --> 00:25.296
I'M NOT GONNA HELP YOU
BREAK UP THEIR ENGAGEMENT.

00:25.296 --> 00:27.698
REGRET WILL HAUNT YOU,
IF YOU LET DANIEL GO.

00:27.698 --> 00:29.500
I WANT TO TELL YOU MY PLAN
FOR AUGUST 8th--

00:29.500 --> 00:31.762
THE DAY VICTORIA GOES DOWN
FOR THE MURDER

00:31.762 --> 00:33.234
OF EMILY THORNE.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.436
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO COMMIT TO ANYTHING.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.338
I JUST CAN'T COMMIT
TO EMILY,

00:37.338 --> 00:39.310
NOT WHEN I FEEL THIS WAY
ABOUT YOU.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.074
I WENT TO THE DOCTOR.
 ARE YOU OKAY?

00:43.074 --> 00:44.145
(chuckles) WE'RE PREGNANT.

00:50.581 --> 00:52.083
WHEN FACING YOUR ENEMY,

00:52.083 --> 00:55.486
NO AMOUNT OF TRAINING
 CAN TRUMP NATURE.

00:55.486 --> 00:58.559
IT SEPARATES THE STRONG
 FROM THE WEAK.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.492
AND SOMETIMES IT TELL US

01:01.492 --> 01:05.135
THAT SURRENDER IS
 THE STRONGEST MOVE OF ALL.

01:05.135 --> 01:07.738
(camera shutter clicks)

01:07.738 --> 01:09.470
(woman, muffled voice)
LET HER GO.

01:15.406 --> 01:17.808
(camera shutter clicking)
 (man) RIGHT THERE. VERY NICE.

01:17.808 --> 01:19.180
(woman) BIG SMILES.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.312
YEAH, THAT'S NICE,
LOOKING AT EACH OTHER.

01:21.312 --> 01:23.484
(camera shutter continues
clicking)
 BEAUTIFUL.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.360
(man) CLOSER.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.422
RIGHT BEHIND HER.

01:31.422 --> 01:34.125
VERY NICE.

01:34.125 --> 01:35.396
LOVELY.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.427
WE GOT IT!

01:36.427 --> 01:38.669
ALL RIGHT.
NEXT, IS THE Di Santo,

01:38.669 --> 01:40.601
WHICH WE'LL BE SHOOTING
AT THE STABLES IN 30.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.874
THAT LHUILLIER FITS YOU
IMPECCABLY, EMILY--

01:43.874 --> 01:45.506
LIKE IT WAS MADE FOR YOU.

01:45.506 --> 01:48.339
WELL, ALL OF THE DRESSES HAVE
BEEN BEAUTIFUL TODAY SO FAR.

01:48.339 --> 01:50.841
ONLY 48 HOURS UNTIL
THE WORLD GETS TO SEE

01:50.841 --> 01:52.813
THE PERFECT ONE YOU'VE CHOSEN
FOR YOUR BIG DAY.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.745
NOW AREN'T THERE SOME QUESTIONS
YOU SHOULD BE ASKING

01:54.745 --> 01:56.417
INSTEAD OF JUST GUSHING
OVER MY FIANCéE, JESS?

01:56.417 --> 01:58.389
OF COURSE.

01:58.389 --> 01:59.650
(clears throat)
SO TELL ME, BOSS,

01:59.650 --> 02:02.253
HOW DOES A MAN
LIKE DANIEL GRAYSON

02:02.253 --> 02:04.325
TAKE A BACK SEAT IN ALL
THE NUPTIAL PREPARATIONS?

02:04.325 --> 02:06.157
BY ADMITTING I DON'T KNOW
THE FIRST THING

02:06.157 --> 02:08.127
ABOUT PLANNING A WEDDING.
 OH, HE'S BEING MODEST.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.360
DANIEL ACTUALLY SELECTED
THE COLOR SCHEME,

02:10.360 --> 02:11.602
THE VENUE...

02:11.602 --> 02:12.863
THE CAKE.

02:12.863 --> 02:14.765
AND WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS
FOR THE DAYS THAT FOLLOW?

02:14.765 --> 02:16.737
WHERE WILL YOU BE RESIDING,
FOR INSTANCE?

02:16.737 --> 02:19.170
OR WHEN WILL YOU BE
NEEDING A NURSERY?

02:19.170 --> 02:21.712
WELL--
 (chuckles) THE WEDDING'S
BEEN OUR MAIN FOCUS.

02:21.712 --> 02:25.376
ONE THING AT A TIME.
ALL RIGHT?

02:25.376 --> 02:26.677
WE'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

02:30.321 --> 02:32.152
(sighs)

02:32.152 --> 02:34.655
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
I CAN KEEP OUR LITTLE SECRET.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.187
NOT THAT I WANT TO
TELL A JOURNALIST

02:36.187 --> 02:37.588
BEFORE YOUR PARENTS.

02:37.588 --> 02:39.490
WELL, LET'S JUST KEEP IT QUIET
UNTIL AFTER THE WEDDING.

02:39.490 --> 02:42.393
I DON'T WANT IT
TO OVERSHADOW YOUR DAY.

02:42.393 --> 02:44.835
BESIDES, I THOUGHT
YOU PREFERRED

02:44.835 --> 02:47.368
TO AVOID ALL THIS
PUBLICITY.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.469
I DON'T KNOW.
FOR SOME REASON,

02:48.469 --> 02:50.341
I'M JUST BURSTING
TO TELL THE WORLD.

02:50.341 --> 02:51.602
MM. WELL, THE TRUTH IS,

02:51.602 --> 02:53.404
"VOULEZ" HAS PUT SO MUCH
INTO THIS ARTICLE

02:53.404 --> 02:56.407
THAT CHANGING IT NOW
WOULD...

02:56.407 --> 02:57.548
THROW THE ISSUE
INTO CHAOS.

02:57.548 --> 02:59.480
AND WE CAN'T TAKE
THAT RISK.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.813
(Jessica) EMILY, I NEED YOU
IN THAT Di Santo, PLEASE.

03:10.861 --> 03:12.463
HOPEFULLY,

03:12.463 --> 03:14.895
THESE NEW ACCOMMODATIONS
WILL SUIT YOUR TASTES.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.968
ANYTHING WOULD BE BETTER
THAN THAT MOTEL YOU CAGED ME IN.

03:17.968 --> 03:20.331
I'VE HAD HANDBAGS
BIGGER THAN THAT ROOM.

03:22.933 --> 03:26.277
AND WHERE'S MY PER DIEM?

03:26.277 --> 03:27.708
JUST CALL ROOM SERVICE.

03:27.708 --> 03:32.343
(chuckles)
I'M NOT TALKING CARBS.

03:32.343 --> 03:34.415
(purse thuds)
 I'M TALKING CARTIER.

03:34.415 --> 03:37.648
I'VE TOLD YOU, YOU'RE NOT
TO GO OUT IN PUBLIC.

03:37.648 --> 03:42.353
I NEED TO PROTECT MY SOURCE
UNTIL MY STORY IS FINISHED.

03:42.353 --> 03:43.724
YOUR STORY?

03:43.724 --> 03:46.357
YOU'D STILL BE ASKING USELESS
QUESTIONS ABOUT NOLAN ROSS

03:46.357 --> 03:47.898
IF I HADN'T REACHED OUT.

03:47.898 --> 03:49.800
AND I'LL BE GRATEFUL
IF THERE IS, IN FACT, TRUTH

03:49.800 --> 03:53.734
TO THE CONSPIRACY THEORY
THAT DAVID CLARKE WAS FRAMED.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.566
BUT WITHOUT TELLING ME
WHO WAS BEHIND IT

03:55.566 --> 03:58.709
AND FINDING ME SOMEONE
WHO CAN CORROBORATE YOUR CLAIM,

03:58.709 --> 04:01.712
OUR STORY IS NOTHING
BUT A COMMON MYTH,

04:01.712 --> 04:04.575
AND I WON'T PRINT THAT.

04:04.575 --> 04:07.778
I'LL NEED A LIST OF PEOPLE
WHO CAN BACK YOU UP,

04:07.778 --> 04:10.581
AND THEIR CONNECTION
TO WHAT HAPPENED.

04:14.325 --> 04:16.827
NO GOOD EVER COMES
FROM DREDGING UP THE PAST--

04:16.827 --> 04:18.629
ESPECIALLY OURS.

04:18.629 --> 04:20.391
WELL, AS DIFFICULT
AS IT MAY BE

04:20.391 --> 04:22.262
FOR EITHER OF US
TO REMEMBER, MY DEAR,

04:22.262 --> 04:25.366
WE HAD SOME GOOD TIMES.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.467
OH, THAT WOULD CALL
INTO QUESTION

04:26.467 --> 04:28.999
YOUR DEFINITION OF "GOOD."
(chuckles)

04:28.999 --> 04:30.741
AS YOU CAN SEE,
IN LIEU OF A PROPER MUSE,

04:30.741 --> 04:32.673
I'M FORCED TO TURN
TO PHOTOGRAPHS

04:32.673 --> 04:35.846
TO ROUSE MY RECOLLECTION
FOR MY MEMOIRS.

04:35.846 --> 04:38.479
DO YOU CARE TO TAKE A TRIP
WITH ME DOWN MEMORY LANE?

04:44.615 --> 04:47.017
(chuckles)

04:47.017 --> 04:48.459
OH, MY GOODNESS,

04:48.459 --> 04:51.422
LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL
AND INNOCENT HE WAS.

04:51.422 --> 04:53.724
HAD WE EVEN SETTLED
ON A NAME YET?
 NO.

04:53.724 --> 04:56.497
DANIEL WAS STILL
"BABY BOY GRAYSON."

04:56.497 --> 04:57.668
(chuckles)
 MM.

05:00.501 --> 05:03.374
AND NOW HE'S MARRYING
THAT CHARLATAN.

05:03.374 --> 05:05.806
OH... THIS AGAIN.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.779
LISTEN, AFTER YOUR LITTLE STUNT
AT EMILY'S BRIDAL LUNCHEON,

05:08.779 --> 05:12.683
YOU ARE ONE LOOSELY VEILED
SPEECH AWAY FROM THE LOONEY BIN.

05:12.683 --> 05:16.417
REEL IT IN, VICTORIA.
 I WAS SHOWING HIM
THE TRUTH.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.419
JUST LET HIM BE.

05:18.419 --> 05:21.352
YOUR OTHER SON BECAME A MURDERER
AFTER ONLY SIX MONTHS WITH YOU.

05:21.352 --> 05:23.454
YOU KNOW,
THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOU

05:23.454 --> 05:25.496
TO STOP THIS FOOLISH
INTERFERING.

05:25.496 --> 05:27.398
TRUST ME.

05:27.398 --> 05:29.860
I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE

05:29.860 --> 05:31.502
THAT WITH HIS HEART
YEARNING FOR ANOTHER,

05:31.502 --> 05:35.636
OUR BABY BOY WILL PUT
AN END TO EMILY HIMSELF.

05:35.636 --> 05:39.670
(ship horn blows
in distance)

05:39.670 --> 05:42.072
♪♪♪

05:42.072 --> 05:44.545
(man) I'LL CALL OVER THERE
AND JUST LET HIM KNOW THAT...

05:44.545 --> 05:46.547
♪♪♪

05:46.547 --> 05:48.048
(woman speaks indistinctly)

05:48.048 --> 05:51.051
OH, SO BEING BUSY AT WORK
ISN'T JUST AND EXCUSE?

05:51.051 --> 05:52.423
(sighs)

05:52.423 --> 05:54.054
LOOK...
 (blinds clatter)

05:54.054 --> 05:56.387
SARA, I'M NOT AVOIDING YOU,
OKAY? IT'S JUST--

05:56.387 --> 05:57.888
IT'S BEEN A WEEK.

05:57.888 --> 06:01.061
YOU KNOW, EVERY DAY
I WEAR THIS, I FEEL WORSE.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.934
IF YOU'RE NOT READY
TO LEAVE EMILY, THEN...

06:03.934 --> 06:06.537
I'M NOT GONNA WAIT AROUND.
OKAY, I'M NOT THAT GIRL.

06:06.537 --> 06:09.470
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO BE.
IT'S JUST THINGS WITH EMILY

06:09.470 --> 06:10.801
ARE A LITTLE...

06:10.801 --> 06:13.373
THEY'RE A LITTLE MORE
COMPLICATED THAN YOU KNOW.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.905
(huffs)

06:15.946 --> 06:19.610
YEAH, WELL, IT LOOKS
PICTURE-PERFECT TO ME.

06:19.610 --> 06:23.383
THIS IS ALL JUST SHOW, OKAY?
IT'S...
 (thuds)

06:23.383 --> 06:24.955
"VOULEZ'S" START HAS BEEN
LESS THAN IDEAL.

06:24.955 --> 06:28.559
AND A SPREAD LIKE THIS SELLS
MAGAZINES, WHICH I NEED.

06:28.559 --> 06:30.761
YEAH, WELL, I NEED TO STOP
FEELING LIKE THE OTHER WOMAN.

06:30.761 --> 06:32.923
SO MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND.

06:34.665 --> 06:35.926
SARA, COME...

06:35.926 --> 06:38.398
SARA.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.403
(ice cubes rattling)

06:45.405 --> 06:46.837
OH. (chuckles)

06:46.837 --> 06:48.739
THERE'S THE BLUSHING BRIDE.

06:48.739 --> 06:51.942
I WOULD OFFER YOU A COCKTAIL,
IF YOU WEREN'T WITH CHILD.
 (alcohol pouring)

06:51.942 --> 06:53.484
HAS THE PACKAGE ARRIVED YET?

06:53.484 --> 06:54.845
NO, NOT TILL TOMORROW.

06:54.845 --> 06:56.487
WHAT'S WRONG?
 (sighs)

06:56.487 --> 06:58.489
DANIEL'S WAVERING.
HE'S BEEN DISTANT ALL WEEK.

06:58.489 --> 07:00.451
THE BABY BOOM DIDN'T
KNOCK HIM OFF THE FENCE,

07:00.451 --> 07:02.723
BACK INTO YOUR ARMS?
 UNFORTUNATELY, NO.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.695
HE'S STILL IN CONTACT
WITH SARA.

07:04.695 --> 07:06.096
I THINK HE'S KEEPING
THE PREGNANCY A SECRET

07:06.096 --> 07:07.658
SO SHE DOESN'T LEAVE HIM.

07:07.658 --> 07:08.799
THAT'S THE WHOLE REASON
YOU PLAYED THAT CARD

07:08.799 --> 07:10.631
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
 SO...

07:10.631 --> 07:11.732
LEAK THE STORY.

07:11.732 --> 07:14.034
HE'LL KNOW IT WAS ME.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.036
AND I CAN'T RISK
LOSING HIS TRUST AGAIN.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.868
YOU ALSO CAN'T RISK
LOSING HIM TO SARA.

07:17.868 --> 07:19.470
MAYBE IT'S TIME WE START
USING MORE DRASTIC MEASURES.

07:19.470 --> 07:21.612
NOT YET.

07:21.612 --> 07:22.843
I'M MEETING
WITH VICTORIA TONIGHT

07:22.843 --> 07:25.215
TO FINALIZE
THE SEATING ARRANGEMENTS.

07:25.215 --> 07:27.678
I GUESS I'LL...
FIGURE OUT A WAY

07:27.678 --> 07:29.820
TO DEAL WITH IT THEN.

07:34.525 --> 07:36.527
(door opens)
 DID YOU GET WHAT I ASKED FOR?

07:40.561 --> 07:42.062
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

07:42.062 --> 07:45.465
IT'S NOT PART OF HER PLAN.
 YES, I'M SURE.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.468
(paper rustling)
 THANK YOU.

07:53.143 --> 07:56.206
IT LOOKS GOOD, ROSS.
 (chuckles)

07:56.206 --> 07:58.679
NOW I JUST NEED
ONE MORE THING--

07:58.679 --> 08:02.052
YOUR ADVICE.

08:02.052 --> 08:05.255
WELL, NOW WHERE TO SEAT
MR. ROSS?

08:05.255 --> 08:07.187
HMM. I WOULD SAY
WITH YOUR OTHER FRIENDS,

08:07.187 --> 08:09.489
BUT YOU DON'T SEEM
TO HAVE ANY.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.522
I'D LIKE TO FIND A PLACE
FOR NOLAN AT THE MAIN TABLE,

08:11.522 --> 08:13.664
SEEING AS HE IS WALKING ME
DOWN THE AISLE.

08:13.664 --> 08:15.195
OH, NONE FOR ME, THANKS.

08:15.195 --> 08:18.098
OH, DON'T TELL ME
THAT YOU'VE SUDDENLY BECOME

08:18.098 --> 08:19.830
A BRIDE OBSESSED
WITH HER FIGURE.

08:19.830 --> 08:23.503
THE WEDDING IS LESS THAN
TWO DAYS AWAY, MY DEAR.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.575
THE DAMAGE
IS ALREADY DONE.

08:24.575 --> 08:27.237
NO, NOTHING LIKE THAT.

08:27.237 --> 08:29.580
HMM?

08:29.580 --> 08:31.281
YOU KNOW, EMILY,
YOU SURPRISE ME.

08:31.281 --> 08:34.284
AFTER LEARNING HER FIANCé
WAS IN THE ARMS OF ANOTHER,

08:34.284 --> 08:36.787
MOST SELF-RESPECTING WOMEN
WOULD CALL THINGS OFF.

08:36.787 --> 08:38.749
AND MANY WIVES WOULD LEAVE
THEIR HUSBANDS,

08:38.749 --> 08:40.289
AND YET, HERE WE ARE.
(chuckles)

08:40.289 --> 08:43.222
AM I TO ASSUME THAT YOU
ADDRESSED THIS WITH DANIEL?
 (thuds)

08:43.222 --> 08:45.926
DANIEL IS GOING
TO BE MY HUSBAND

08:45.926 --> 08:48.128
AND THE FATHER
OF MY CHILDREN.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.060
I'LL ADDRESS IT
THE WAY I SEE FIT.

08:50.060 --> 08:52.703
YOUR IGNORING THE PROBLEM
WILL ONLY MAKE MATTERS WORSE.
 (rustling)

08:52.703 --> 08:54.765
I CAN ASSURE YOU.

08:54.765 --> 08:56.737
VICTORIA?

08:56.737 --> 08:58.238
HMM?
 (rustling continues)

09:00.971 --> 09:03.674
WHAT THE HELL?

09:03.674 --> 09:07.117
(footsteps approach)

09:07.117 --> 09:09.580
(gasps)

09:09.580 --> 09:11.221
(clothes rustling)
 LYDIA?

09:13.784 --> 09:16.957
DON'T JUST STAND THERE.
ZIP ME UP.

09:35.606 --> 09:36.847
WHAT IT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:36.847 --> 09:38.879
GIVING YOUR WARDROBE
SOME MUCH-NEEDED EDITING.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.951
YOU ALL RIGHT, DEAR?

09:40.951 --> 09:42.312
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST.

09:42.312 --> 09:46.617
WELL, YOU'VE CERTAINLY PROVED
RESILIENT BEFORE, LYDIA.

09:46.617 --> 09:48.318
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I SHOULD BE SURPRISED.

09:48.318 --> 09:52.022
I TAKE IT YOU SAVED HER.

09:52.022 --> 09:55.926
I'M BEGINNING TO QUESTION
THE WISDOM OF MY MERCY.

09:55.926 --> 09:57.898
EMILY, WOULD YOU PLEASE
EXCUSE US?

10:06.606 --> 10:09.379
NOT ONLY IS

FORCED TO EXIT THAT PLANE,

LEFT THAT PLANE.

19:35.945 --> 19:37.677
OH, MY GOD!
DANIEL, LOOK!

19:37.677 --> 19:39.709
(all shouting at once)
 HOW DID THE PRESS
FIND OUT WE WERE HERE?

19:39.709 --> 19:41.351
(man) EMILY! EMILY! EMILY!

19:41.351 --> 19:44.384
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.
WE ONLY TOLD YOUR MOTHER.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.815
I CAN'T BELIEVE HER.
 (whispers) OH, MY GOSH.

19:45.815 --> 19:47.517
JUST PUT--
JUST PUT THE TOP UP.
 (camera shutter clicks)

19:47.517 --> 19:51.521
(clamoring)

19:51.521 --> 19:53.192
JUST GO. JUST DRIVE.

19:55.665 --> 19:58.468
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?!

19:58.468 --> 20:00.670
I TOLD YOU WE WANTED TO KEEP
THE PREGNANCY NEWS QUIET,

20:00.670 --> 20:02.201
AND YOU LEAKED IT ANYWAY.
AND FOR WHAT--

20:02.201 --> 20:03.703
AN-ANOTHER SHOT AT EMILY?

20:03.703 --> 20:05.535
I DID NOTHING OF THE SORT.

20:05.535 --> 20:07.377
AND WHAT MAKES YOU SO CERTAIN
THAT SHE WASN'T BEHIND IT?

20:07.377 --> 20:09.509
COME ON. WHAT POSSIBLE REASON
COULD SHE HAVE?

20:09.509 --> 20:11.511
TO MAKE CERTAIN
THAT YOU MARRY HER

20:11.511 --> 20:13.343
AND NOT LEAVE FOR SARA.

20:13.343 --> 20:15.685
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:15.685 --> 20:17.717
I KNOW ABOUT YOUR NIGHT
IN THE PIED-à-TERRE.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.889
OH. WELL, I DIDN'T
SLEEP WITH HER,

20:19.889 --> 20:21.621
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE INSINUATING.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.253
NOT THAT IT'S
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

20:23.253 --> 20:24.454
NO, IT'S EMILY'S.

20:24.454 --> 20:27.457
YOU TOLD EMILY?

20:27.457 --> 20:28.658
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT, I DID.

20:28.658 --> 20:29.929
YOU ARE MARRYING ONE GIRL,

20:29.929 --> 20:31.561
AND YOU'RE IN LOVE
WITH ANOTHER, DANIEL.

20:31.561 --> 20:32.662
NO, YOU DON'T KNOW A DAMN THING
ABOUT WHO I LOVE.

20:32.662 --> 20:34.334
I THINK I DO,
AND SO DOES EMILY.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.965
AND THAT'S WHY SHE TRAPPED YOU
INTO THIS PREGNANCY BUSINESS.

20:35.965 --> 20:37.867
YOU'VE COMPLETELY
LOST YOUR MIND, YOU KNOW THAT?

20:37.867 --> 20:39.439
LISTEN TO ME,
SHE IS A CON ARTIST.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.940
SHE IS--
 SHE IS GOING
TO BE MY WIFE,

20:40.940 --> 20:43.513
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT
OR NOT! YOU KNOW WHY?

20:43.513 --> 20:45.575
BECAUSE SHE IS GIVING ME
THE OPPORTUNITY

20:45.575 --> 20:47.347
TO RAISE A CHILD
THE RIGHT WAY--

20:47.347 --> 20:48.548
IN A LOVING HOME.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.620
NOT WITH A LOVELESS MARRIAGE.
 OH, COME ON.

20:50.620 --> 20:52.251
DANIEL, OPEN YOUR EYES!
 STOP!

20:52.251 --> 20:55.625
SHE HAS DECEIVED YOU
FROM DAY ONE!
 ENOUGH! ENOUGH!

20:55.625 --> 20:59.629
THIS TIME TOMORROW,
EMILY AND I WILL BE MARRIED.

20:59.629 --> 21:02.562
YOU LOST. OKAY?
IT'S OVER.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.803
HELLO?

21:16.275 --> 21:17.477
JAKE?

21:17.477 --> 21:19.479
CONRAD GRAYSON.

21:19.479 --> 21:22.482
HOPE I'M NOT TOO EARLY.

21:22.482 --> 21:25.855
YOU'RE RIGHT ON TIME.

21:25.855 --> 21:28.758
MY GOD.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.021
LYDIA?

21:32.021 --> 21:34.924
HELLO, CONRAD.

21:34.924 --> 21:37.026
IS IT REALLY YOU?

21:37.026 --> 21:38.568
ALMOST AS HARD TO BELIEVE
AS "TIME" MAGAZINE

21:38.568 --> 21:39.999
WANTING YOU FOR A COVER.

21:39.999 --> 21:43.032
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS HARBORED
A HOPE WHEN VICTORIA SURVIVED

21:43.032 --> 21:44.734
THAT YOU'D DONE THE SAME.

21:44.734 --> 21:46.305
REALLY?

21:46.305 --> 21:48.338
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT LET ME GET ON THAT PLANE.

21:48.338 --> 21:49.679
I'D BE DEAD IF IT WASN'T
FOR YOUR WIFE'S

21:49.679 --> 21:51.511
MOMENTARY LAPSE OF EVIL.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.012
WELL, THEN I'VE NEVER
BEEN MORE GRATEFUL FOR HER

21:53.012 --> 21:55.985
THAN I AM AT THIS MOMENT.

21:55.985 --> 21:58.948
AND YOU LOOK...

21:58.948 --> 22:00.990
LIKE NO TIME HAS PASSED.

22:02.852 --> 22:05.725
I'M NOT FALLING FOR THIS.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.927
WE WERE ENGAGED, CONRAD,

22:07.927 --> 22:09.599
AND YOU SENT ME
TO MY DEATH.

22:09.599 --> 22:12.061
LYDIA, I DID EVERYTHING
I COULD TO STOP YOU.

22:12.061 --> 22:13.933
I MEAN, IF MEMORY SERVES,
YOU CONJURED

22:13.933 --> 22:16.105
A SICK MOTHER
TO GET AWAY FROM ME.

22:16.105 --> 22:18.838
BUT I TAKE THE BLAME
FOR INSPIRING SUCH A TURN, BUT--

22:18.838 --> 22:20.069
I FIND THAT HARD
TO BELIEVE.

22:20.069 --> 22:23.112
BELIEVE WHAT YOU MUST.

22:23.112 --> 22:25.044
YOU OBVIOUSLY THOUGHT
I'D BE SET AGAINST YOU

22:25.044 --> 22:26.976
TO USE THIS RUSE
TO GET ME HERE.

22:26.976 --> 22:29.078
BUT BELIEVE ME,

22:29.078 --> 22:31.681
HONESTY WOULD HAVE WORKED.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.955
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.
 WHY?

22:35.955 --> 22:40.860
OH, I CAN SEE YOU'RE NOT
DONE WITH ME YET.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.994
TRUST ME, CONRAD.

22:44.994 --> 22:47.567
WHEN I'M DONE WITH YOU,

22:47.567 --> 22:48.998
YOU'LL KNOW IT.

22:58.808 --> 23:01.651
(door opens)

23:01.651 --> 23:03.713
(sighs)
 (door closes)

23:03.713 --> 23:07.116
(Velcro rips)

23:07.116 --> 23:09.819
(clicks and beeps)

23:15.665 --> 23:18.698
THAT SHOULD BE ALL
FOR TODAY, MS. THORNE.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.630
OR SHOULD I SAY
MRS. GRAYSON?

23:20.630 --> 23:22.602
NOT YET, DON.
LET'S SEE HOW TOMORROW GOES.
 THANK YOU.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.604
THANKS.
 HEY, DON'T STRESS.

23:24.604 --> 23:26.035
IT'S GONNA BE
THE BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE.

23:26.035 --> 23:29.679
(man) YEAH,
CONGRATULATIONS, MS. THORNE.

23:29.679 --> 23:31.481
(Charlotte)
IS IT TRUE?
 HEY.

23:31.481 --> 23:35.585
ARE YOU REALLY...
 PREGNANT? (sighs)

23:35.585 --> 23:37.186
WE WANTED TO TELL YOU
FIRST, BUT...

23:37.186 --> 23:39.789
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

23:39.789 --> 23:44.053
I'M JUST SO HAPPY FOR YOU.
 HMM.

23:44.053 --> 23:47.096
AND I PROMISE
TO BE A MUCH BETTER AUNT

23:47.096 --> 23:48.628
THAN MAID OF HONOR.

23:48.628 --> 23:50.730
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

23:50.730 --> 23:53.903
I JUST FEEL LIKE
I HAVEN'T BEEN VERY HELPFUL,

23:53.903 --> 23:56.435
TO YOU OR DANIEL.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.908
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I HAVE YOUR BACK.

24:00.710 --> 24:03.813
AND IF YOU'LL LET ME,
YOUR HANDS AND FEET.

24:05.545 --> 24:08.077
LADIES?

24:08.077 --> 24:09.579
(chuckles)
 (chuckles)

24:09.579 --> 24:11.020
(woman) HI. HI, MS. THORNE.
 WHAT IS THIS?

24:11.020 --> 24:12.221
IT'S THE DAY BEFORE
YOUR WEDDING.

24:12.221 --> 24:13.883
YOU DESERVE TO BE PAMPERED.

24:13.883 --> 24:16.085
SO YOU'RE GETTING
A MANI-PEDI.

24:16.085 --> 24:18.127
THANK YOU, CHARLOTTE.
I LOVE IT.
 (chuckles)

24:18.127 --> 24:21.491
HEY, WE'RE SISTERS.
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

24:21.491 --> 24:24.463
(chuckles)

24:27.096 --> 24:30.570
(speaking French)
 (telephone rings)

24:32.572 --> 24:34.073
MERCI.

24:36.045 --> 24:38.147
MARGAUX LeMARCHAL SPEAKING.

24:38.147 --> 24:40.680
MS. LeMARCHAL,
THIS IS THE CONCIERGE DESK

24:40.680 --> 24:42.051
AT THE STELLA HOTEL.

24:42.051 --> 24:44.113
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU,

24:44.113 --> 24:48.017
BUT... A BOTTLE OF KRUG BRUT
WAS ORDERED TO YOUR GUEST'S ROOM

24:48.017 --> 24:49.789
BY A VISITOR THIS AFTERNOON.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.060
A VISITOR?

24:51.060 --> 24:52.191
Yes. Yes, ma'am.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.993
Would you prefer that charged
to your room

24:53.993 --> 24:57.126
OR TO MR. GRAYSON'S
PERSONAL ACCOUNT?

24:57.126 --> 24:59.268
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU DOING?

24:59.268 --> 25:02.772
I WANTED HIM TO PAY,
SO I WAS TRYING TO TRAP HIM.

25:02.772 --> 25:04.974
AND?
 I GOT NOTHING.

25:04.974 --> 25:07.206
SO YOU PUT MY ENTIRE
STORY AT RISK?

25:07.206 --> 25:10.540
AND FOR WHAT--A FEW DRESSES
AND A QUICK ACCOUPLEMENT?

25:10.540 --> 25:12.141
(sighs)

25:14.183 --> 25:16.215
HE'S NOT THE MAN
I REMEMBERED.

25:16.215 --> 25:19.849
ARE YOU JUST PLAYING ME
TO REUNITE WITH AN OLD FLAME?

25:21.721 --> 25:24.894
YOU'RE OF NO USE TO ME
IF I CAN'T TRUST YOU.

25:24.894 --> 25:27.557
CONSIDER OUR ARRANGEMENT
TERMINATED.

25:29.959 --> 25:31.961
THIS STAYS WITH ME.

25:31.961 --> 25:34.634
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH
LEFT TO CLING TO,

25:34.634 --> 25:35.905
DO YOU, MS. DAVIS?

25:41.210 --> 25:42.912
(bullet casings clatter)

25:47.016 --> 25:48.247
(gunshot)

25:50.650 --> 25:52.822
THE TIME HAS COME
FOR VICTORIA TO PAY

25:52.822 --> 25:54.083
THE ULTIMATE PRICE.

25:54.083 --> 25:56.986
AND I BRING A GIFT
TO HELP YOU DO JUST THAT.

25:56.986 --> 25:58.257
(thuds)

25:58.257 --> 25:59.889
MS. DAVIS WILL NO LONGER
BE A PROBLEM.

25:59.889 --> 26:02.091
TURNS OUT SHE WAS SELLING
HER DIRTY GRAYSON SECRETS

26:02.091 --> 26:04.163
TO OUR RESIDENT LOIS LANE.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.294
MARGAUX.

26:05.294 --> 26:07.136
BUT LYDIA COULDN'T
HELP HERSELF.

26:07.136 --> 26:08.337
I CAUGHT HER MEETING
WITH CONRAD.

26:08.337 --> 26:10.169
OLD HABITS.

26:10.169 --> 26:13.643
I ALERTED MARGAUX
TO HER SHIFTING ALLEGIANCE.

26:13.643 --> 26:15.274
BUT ONCE MARGAUX'S DISPENSED
WITH HER, IT WON'T BE LONG

26:15.274 --> 26:17.607
UNTIL LYDIA'S CRAWLING
BACK TO CONRAD.

26:17.607 --> 26:19.008
LET HER.

26:19.008 --> 26:21.110
IT WILL KEEP VICTORIA
DISTRACTED.

26:21.110 --> 26:24.754
(clatters and clacks)
 WELL, IT SEEMS
THAT SHE'S, UH,

26:24.754 --> 26:26.956
DISTRACTED ENOUGH, IF YOU'VE
ALREADY GOT YOUR FINGERS

26:26.956 --> 26:28.287
ON THAT BRACELET.

26:28.287 --> 26:30.820
AND I'LL SLIP IT BACK
INTO VICTORIA'S CLOSET

26:30.820 --> 26:32.291
BEFORE SHE EVER
KNOWS ABOUT IT.

26:32.291 --> 26:35.364
ONCE IT'S COVERED
IN GUNSHOT RESIDUE, OF COURSE.

26:58.688 --> 26:59.989
YES, I'M CALLING FOR
MR. HARMON, PLEASE?

27:01.250 --> 27:04.393
WELL, DO YOU HAVE
A NEW CONTACT NUMBER?

27:04.393 --> 27:06.355
WHAT ABOUT A FORWARDING ADDRESS?

27:08.257 --> 27:10.860
NOTHING. I SEE. MERCI.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.203
(knock on door)

27:15.835 --> 27:19.208
I DESPISE PEOPLE INTERRUPTING ME
WHEN I'M WORKING.

27:19.208 --> 27:21.370
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THEY HAVE A GOOD REASON,

27:21.370 --> 27:24.073
AND I'VE GOT A DOOZY.

27:24.073 --> 27:28.117
DOES THIS MEAN YOU'VE
RECONSIDERED MY PROPOSAL?

27:28.117 --> 27:29.278
YOU WISH.

27:29.278 --> 27:31.320
NO, I STAND STEADFAST
BY MY STATEMENT.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.422
YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE.

27:33.422 --> 27:37.286
PERHAPS, AS WE SAY
IN THE STATES,

27:37.286 --> 27:40.659
YOU ARE BARKING UP
THE WRONG TREE.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.892
UNLIKE THE REST OF YOU,

27:42.892 --> 27:46.265
I'M NOT SO EASILY DISSUADED.

27:46.265 --> 27:47.937
THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE,

27:47.937 --> 27:50.339
AND I WON'T STOP
UNTIL I FIND IT.

27:50.339 --> 27:51.971
DO ME ONE FAVOR--

27:51.971 --> 27:54.343
LET ME GIVE YOU A LEAD.

28:04.954 --> 28:07.416
I HOPE YOU HAVEN'T WRITTEN
THE CHAPTER ON ME YET.

28:14.123 --> 28:16.325
YOU MAY HAVE SWEET-TALKED
YOUR WAY PAST THE HELP,

28:16.325 --> 28:18.367
BUT IF YOU ARE HERE
TO EXACT MORE PUNISHMENT,

28:18.367 --> 28:21.901
YOU'VE CLEARLY FORGOTTEN
WHO I AM.

28:21.901 --> 28:26.475
SEEING YOU, I'VE REMEMBERED
HOW MUCH YOU MEAN TO ME.

28:26.475 --> 28:28.437
AND I'VE COME TO MY SENSES.

28:28.437 --> 28:34.013
I REALIZE I SHOULDN'T HAVE
CHOSEN VICTORIA OVER YOU.

28:34.013 --> 28:36.245
I'LL NEVER DO THAT AGAIN.

28:38.848 --> 28:40.189
WELL...

28:41.821 --> 28:45.154
IT SEEMS WE'VE BOTH
MADE MISTAKES.

28:47.156 --> 28:48.497
THEN LET'S CALL IT EVEN.

28:48.497 --> 28:50.760
SHALL WE?

28:53.362 --> 28:55.504
(chuckles)

28:59.208 --> 29:02.211
♪♪♪

29:10.319 --> 29:13.382
YOU WEREN'T LYING WHEN YOU SAID
IT WAS COMPLICATED.

29:15.324 --> 29:16.926
I NEVER LIED TO YOU.

29:16.926 --> 29:20.359
BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
THAT EMILY WAS PREGNANT.

29:20.359 --> 29:21.791
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

29:21.791 --> 29:24.093
WELL, NOW'S YOUR CHANCE.

29:26.395 --> 29:29.438
THE MOMENT I SAW YOU
IN THE BAKERY...

29:31.240 --> 29:34.403
ALL THE FEELINGS I ONCE HAD
CAME RUSHING BACK.

29:36.445 --> 29:38.307
AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU
AGAIN.

29:38.307 --> 29:41.780
SARA, EMILY'S HAVING MY BABY.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.914
WE BOTH KNOW WHAT A BROKEN HOME
CAN DO TO A KID.

29:48.017 --> 29:52.461
YOU KNOW, I WISH I COULD
TELL YOU I DON'T UNDERSTAND,

29:52.461 --> 29:55.324
THAT YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE,
BUT I CAN'T.

29:55.324 --> 29:57.026
(whispers) I'M SORRY.

30:00.369 --> 30:03.202
(voice breaking)
THIS IS THE WAY IT IS.

30:05.334 --> 30:07.576
WE'RE JUST NOT MEANT TO BE.

30:14.483 --> 30:16.315
(exhales deeply)

30:20.489 --> 30:22.321
(exhales deeply)

30:25.824 --> 30:27.857
GOOD-BYE, DANNY.

30:27.857 --> 30:30.359
SARA.

31:10.199 --> 31:13.402
THIS FAMILY IS SO PREDICTABLE.

31:13.402 --> 31:17.606
WHEN THREATENED, EACH GRAYSON
HAS THEIR OWN RETREAT,

31:17.606 --> 31:19.548
LIKE A TURTLE'S SHELL--

31:19.548 --> 31:21.250
DAD AND HIS DEN,

31:21.250 --> 31:22.511
YOU AND THIS CUPOLA.

31:22.511 --> 31:25.154
DANIEL'S RUNNING TRAIL.

31:25.154 --> 31:26.415
WHERE'S YOURS, CHARLOTTE?

31:26.415 --> 31:29.388
AND PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
IT'S THAT BAR.

31:31.460 --> 31:34.994
I'M HOPING IT'LL BE
MY NEW APARTMENT.

31:34.994 --> 31:37.096
ONCE THIS WEDDING MADNESS
IS OVER,

31:37.096 --> 31:38.627
I'M MOVING OUT
OF THE STOWAWAY.

31:38.627 --> 31:40.429
IT'S TIME I LEAD
MY OWN LIFE, MOM,

31:40.429 --> 31:43.902
JUST LIKE IT'S TIME FOR DANIEL
TO LEAD HIS.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.205
WHAT WE DID WITH SARA
HURT THEM BOTH,

31:46.205 --> 31:48.437
AND DANIEL WAS BETTER OFF
WITHOUT US INTERFERING.

31:48.437 --> 31:49.608
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.310
I DO.

31:51.310 --> 31:54.183
I SAW THE PAIN HE WAS IN
BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DID.

31:54.183 --> 31:56.385
I'M DONE MEDDLING,

31:56.385 --> 31:59.418
AND IT'S TIME
YOU STOPPED, TOO.

32:15.564 --> 32:18.507
IT'S TRADITION FOR A WARRIOR

ON THE START,

32:39.128 --> 32:42.491
HOW YOU'VE CHANGED,

32:42.491 --> 32:45.494
WHAT YOU'VE LOST,

32:45.494 --> 32:47.166
AND WHAT YOU'VE GAINED.

33:11.260 --> 33:15.364
WHEN YOU AND I FIRST MET,

33:15.364 --> 33:17.266
WE HAD BOTH LOST SO MUCH

33:17.266 --> 33:20.429
AND FACED IMMENSE PAIN.

33:20.429 --> 33:24.433
BUT OUT OF THAT PAIN
CAME SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL...

33:26.205 --> 33:27.406
LOVE.

33:27.406 --> 33:30.679
A LOVE THAT WILL ALWAYS TRIUMPH
OVER DARKNESS.

LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR.
