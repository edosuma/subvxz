01:25.696 --> 01:29.406
Asshole! Son of a bitch
is gonna kill somebody.

02:19.328 --> 02:20.473
He's still alive.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.182
Lloyd, will you get the tape?

02:44.928 --> 02:46.870
Let's move it!

02:50.912 --> 02:54.174
- How much further?
- Two more flights.

02:54.400 --> 03:00.249
- You said up the street.
- It's right there, Grandma! God!

03:00.481 --> 03:03.350
- Let's just forget about it!
- Come on!

03:03.553 --> 03:07.066
- Take your hand off me!
- I'll go get the TV.

03:07.297 --> 03:11.836
You think I'm gonna let you
walk away with my $300? No way.

03:12.032 --> 03:16.288
Good idea. This guy might not
be totally legit.

03:16.512 --> 03:17.941
- Who is it?
- It's me.

03:18.209 --> 03:20.510
- Me who?
- Cornbread! Open up.

03:20.737 --> 03:22.679
I want the you-know-what.

03:22.880 --> 03:27.517
- You didn't use the code.
- The fat man walks slowly!

03:27.713 --> 03:30.430
The fat man need to lose some weight!

03:31.201 --> 03:33.622
Just open the fucking door!

03:33.856 --> 03:38.745
What's all this hostility about?
How you doing? Who's this?

03:38.977 --> 03:40.667
- Who's with you?
- Frank.

03:40.897 --> 03:44.442
Frank, how you doing?
That short for Frankfurter?

03:46.209 --> 03:50.038
Don't stand out here like
a couple of roaches.

03:50.241 --> 03:53.754
- Come on in, Frankfurter.
- Place smells like a pigsty!

03:54.016 --> 03:56.886
I know. That's the dead guy next door.

03:57.121 --> 04:01.528
He died on the toilet. They gotta
wipe his ass and take him away.

04:01.728 --> 04:05.405
- You don't want no car phone?
- I said I wanted a TV!

04:05.601 --> 04:08.470
You said this piece of shit
had color TVs!

04:08.672 --> 04:13.277
Are you wasting my time?
You give me my money back.

04:13.472 --> 04:15.512
Frankfurter! Frankfurter!

04:15.713 --> 04:19.935
Don't get all hyper. Cornbread
telling you what else we got.

04:20.128 --> 04:23.608
- The TV's in the other room.
- Get it, then!

04:23.808 --> 04:27.386
- Go get it!
- Before I kick both your asses!

04:27.712 --> 04:31.029
Yeah! Before he kick both our asses!

04:32.033 --> 04:33.210
Damn!

04:34.913 --> 04:40.608
All the crazy dudes in the world
to have working for you.

04:40.800 --> 04:45.208
- Did you ever hear the one about...?
- Hey, what are you doing?

04:45.856 --> 04:48.442
- It's dinnertime.
- Can't that shit wait?

04:48.640 --> 04:53.561
- Not in front of me!
- You hungry? I got some chicken left.

04:53.792 --> 04:56.029
Here you go. Here's some chicken.

04:56.289 --> 04:59.605
Hey, man, I dug in a lot of
garbages for that!

04:59.840 --> 05:03.353
Let me hold your belt.
I gotta get this vein up.

05:03.616 --> 05:07.445
A vein just don't come every day,
you gotta get it...

05:07.649 --> 05:09.339
Let me wear your belt!

05:09.632 --> 05:14.236
All right! Hurry up, you piece
of trash! Hate you people!

05:14.529 --> 05:18.555
I figured that out when you
walked in the room.

05:20.352 --> 05:22.141
Oh, God!

05:23.617 --> 05:26.683
- Oh, God.
- What's the matter?

05:26.880 --> 05:31.288
- What's happening?
- That shit was no good!

05:31.488 --> 05:32.633
What happened?

05:32.896 --> 05:36.606
- He took some bad drugs.
- Shit! Take this and go!

05:36.800 --> 05:38.873
Before the cops come! Run, fatso!

05:39.616 --> 05:44.286
Come on, man.
Don't you die on me! Slim?

05:44.832 --> 05:47.320
No! Go! He's dead.

06:01.569 --> 06:04.733
You bastards!

06:08.033 --> 06:10.488
Mo' money! Mo' money!

06:10.688 --> 06:11.932
- Look at that!
- Here.

06:12.129 --> 06:14.267
- Hey!
- What?

06:14.560 --> 06:18.040
That was fun!
You seen the look on the guy's face?

06:18.241 --> 06:22.267
You should've seen when I gave
him the chicken.

06:22.912 --> 06:24.952
- What's the matter?
- Tooth hurts.

06:25.216 --> 06:27.070
- Which one?
- Right here.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.270
Get it fixed.

06:31.648 --> 06:33.274
Hey, yo. Check it out.

06:33.856 --> 06:37.238
- Oh, snap. Go get that.
- All right.

06:39.552 --> 06:43.197
- Easy. Easy, baby.
- Good evening, officer.

06:43.456 --> 06:47.962
- Keep moving, or I'll take you in!
- Johnny, that's really not funny.

06:48.192 --> 06:50.047
- Nice night.
- Move it!

06:50.273 --> 06:52.639
Here's some chicken.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.767
Stop, you sons of bitches!

07:00.992 --> 07:03.643
- You chasing those guys?
- They robbed me.

07:03.872 --> 07:06.076
Get away from me, fucking bum!

07:06.336 --> 07:10.231
- I'm a cop.
- Hey! Wait a minute!

07:10.433 --> 07:10.464
- Stop! Police!
- Here comes fatso! Come on!

07:10.464 --> 07:14.010
- Stop! Police!
- Here comes fatso! Come on!

07:25.472 --> 07:29.847
- Hold that for me!
- Look out! Coming through!

07:34.912 --> 07:36.341
Come on!

07:37.056 --> 07:38.551
Hold it!

07:40.928 --> 07:44.572
You get them. I'm finished.

07:45.472 --> 07:48.319
You're mine! Shit!

07:55.968 --> 07:57.277
Get off my car!

08:25.376 --> 08:30.264
Young man? Pay your fare.
Pay your fare! Pay your fare!

08:31.680 --> 08:35.226
Pay your fare! Comb your hair!

08:45.632 --> 08:49.428
- What do we got here, Mills?
- Ted Forrest, age 47.

08:49.632 --> 08:53.494
Died at 1:13. Messenger for
the Dynasty Corporation.

08:53.696 --> 08:58.552
- It appears to be another hit-and-run.
- I just don't understand it.

08:58.816 --> 09:00.670
Yeah, it is pretty insane.

09:00.928 --> 09:04.638
How do they get the jelly
into these things?

09:10.208 --> 09:14.648
- Any of you touch this?
- I gave orders not to move anything.

09:14.880 --> 09:18.328
Well, somebody did.
Wonder what that means?

09:18.560 --> 09:22.717
- I don't know, sir.
- Me neither. Thank you. Hold that.

09:26.112 --> 09:29.428
Oh, boy. Get me that case.
I'll deliver that myself.

09:29.632 --> 09:31.672
You wrap everything else up.

09:31.936 --> 09:35.198
- I got a few things I gotta do.
- Yes, sir.

09:36.736 --> 09:39.224
Yeah, I know what you mean.

09:39.488 --> 09:40.895
Sure.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.448
Hey! Anybody got some paper?

09:47.680 --> 09:50.647
Sounds like you need the Sunday Tfmes.

09:55.712 --> 09:59.421
Like I said, I had that
little bitch by the neck.

09:59.616 --> 10:04.405
Started twisting till it snapped.
Almost killed that little ho!

10:04.608 --> 10:09.277
Then my mom come running in saying,
"What you doing to your sister?"

10:09.568 --> 10:13.146
She lucky, man!
They both lucky! You know? Pop!

10:13.408 --> 10:18.493
Two for one! She my mom,
but she ain't breast-feeding me!

10:18.688 --> 10:22.071
Now Mom talking about
pressing charges on me.

10:22.368 --> 10:24.823
Man, I don't give a damn-blam-Sam.

10:25.056 --> 10:28.155
I'm ready to jam!
I do time for breakfast!

10:28.352 --> 10:32.824
"What you got for me today, judge?
Five years?

10:33.120 --> 10:34.713
Yeah! Seven years, judge?

10:34.912 --> 10:38.490
Give me life, judge.
I got an appetite. Big one!"

10:39.680 --> 10:44.414
That's what I'm gonna tell the judge!
"Judge, kiss this ass!"

10:44.832 --> 10:49.469
- That's right!
- Hey, my man! You using that hat?

10:52.448 --> 10:56.638
- Hey, man! What's your problem?
- Give me a cigarette, boy.

10:57.472 --> 11:00.570
- I don't smoke.
- I said give me a cigarette!

11:00.800 --> 11:03.320
- Stewart! Visitor!
- I don't smoke.

11:06.688 --> 11:07.833
Wrong answer.

11:08.096 --> 11:13.049
You're supposed to say,
"I'll get you one."

11:13.248 --> 11:15.703
- I'll get you one.
- Jonathan Stewart!

11:18.912 --> 11:21.432
As soon as you find
your fucking balls!

11:24.576 --> 11:27.227
You're dead! You're dead!

11:31.711 --> 11:35.770
- It's not funny.
- What's up with you? You getting old?

11:35.968 --> 11:38.269
The stupid transit cop.

11:38.560 --> 11:42.073
I thought Frankfurter got you!

11:45.759 --> 11:49.589
If they find out about my probation,
I could go away.

11:50.848 --> 11:53.499
Don't worry. I got you a lawyer.

11:54.528 --> 11:56.568
- Is he good?
- What's my name?

11:56.768 --> 11:58.394
- Is he?
- What's my name?

11:58.591 --> 12:02.552
- Is he good?
- He's the best lawyer in town!

12:04.896 --> 12:06.685
For the money.

12:06.879 --> 12:06.944
Your Honor? Allow me to fumigate
my wisdom on the defendant.

12:06.944 --> 12:12.759
Your Honor? Allow me to fumigate
my wisdom on the defendant.

12:12.991 --> 12:19.004
Since he has been incarcerated in the
propaganda of the prison structure...

12:19.200 --> 12:22.681
...on the issue of
the court thing. Yes!

12:22.912 --> 12:26.905
And I must say here
that it has been a real...

12:27.135 --> 12:30.583
...didactic experience for him,
as you can see.

12:30.816 --> 12:34.907
Can I get a witness? Yes, Lord.
And I must say...

12:35.168 --> 12:38.365
...that both physically
and geographically...

12:38.559 --> 12:42.869
...if he be sent to the bowels
of the community, I said...

12:43.072 --> 12:44.697
...if he be sent to the bowels...

12:45.120 --> 12:49.561
...the manifestation will be much
too much for him to resign!

12:50.112 --> 12:54.236
I rest my scrotum.

12:55.552 --> 12:58.399
- Are you serious?
- Oh, yes, sir!

13:00.928 --> 13:03.383
Oh, Mr. Stewart!

13:04.960 --> 13:08.255
The last time I saw you was...

13:09.120 --> 13:11.542
...only three months ago.

13:11.807 --> 13:14.742
I said if you showed
your stupid face again...

13:14.976 --> 13:18.325
...I would put you underneath
the jail, didn't I?

13:18.560 --> 13:21.876
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Did you think I was playing?

13:22.111 --> 13:23.191
No, Your Honor.

13:23.456 --> 13:28.125
I'm considering postponing your case
for a few months...

13:28.608 --> 13:33.943
...just to let you think about
how you're wasting my time!

13:34.239 --> 13:39.836
Since you've been so ill-represented
by the "propaganda of the court"...

13:40.095 --> 13:44.830
...l'll have a sympathetic
"decapany" on this case. Dismissed.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.527
- Your Honor!
- Thank you.

13:46.719 --> 13:51.837
And you get out of my court
before I send you away! Next case.

13:52.096 --> 13:55.129
Roscoe Kent versus Elvira Kent.

13:55.359 --> 13:58.872
That's right, judge!
Put him under the jail.

13:59.072 --> 14:03.829
Could I get Reverend Pimp Daddy
to be my lawyer, please?

14:04.095 --> 14:08.438
Reverend, my sister'll work it off
for you when she gets better.

14:13.920 --> 14:18.044
- One day your ass is mine.
- Yeah, come on! Come on!

14:19.936 --> 14:24.027
You were sweating in there.
You're not as tough as you think.

14:24.319 --> 14:28.662
- Thanks for getting me out, Walsh.
- Me? Are you hungry?

14:28.928 --> 14:31.862
- Nope.
- Well, I am.

14:54.656 --> 14:57.471
I thought you were
supposed to be working.

14:57.696 --> 14:59.070
I quit.

14:59.360 --> 15:02.077
- I'm sorry?
- I said, I quit!

15:02.336 --> 15:04.507
Oh, I see. You quit.

15:04.735 --> 15:10.332
Maybe I should quit helping some punk
make something of his life.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.665
What happened to Kluck-A-Bucks?

15:12.927 --> 15:18.644
I was in a chicken costume, giving
out coupons. It didn't fit my image.

15:18.879 --> 15:22.654
What image?
You're unemployed, you're invisible.

15:22.848 --> 15:26.677
You're not even a statistic.
John, a job is a job!

15:26.911 --> 15:32.094
- Tell that to the white boys!
- You're gonna have to try harder!

15:33.312 --> 15:37.305
You can clean shithouses,
as long as it's an honest buck.

15:37.568 --> 15:42.270
- I won't clean shithouses.
- Take a look around you. Is this it?

15:42.527 --> 15:45.527
You gonna be happy with this
your whole life?

15:45.919 --> 15:49.268
You tell me what it is
that you wanna do.

15:50.911 --> 15:55.035
- Maybe a cop, like my father.
- You don't have what it takes.

15:55.711 --> 15:58.711
Talking about your father,
I tell you, he was...

15:58.912 --> 16:02.490
"The best cop ever." He's dead!
So what does that say?

16:02.912 --> 16:05.846
Not too much, according to you.

16:06.079 --> 16:10.968
But he was my partner!
He saved my life! You understand?

16:11.168 --> 16:14.484
He was stupid.
You're here and he's gone.

16:14.688 --> 16:18.332
I can't help that.
I'll tell you about your dad.

16:18.528 --> 16:23.034
- We're sitting in on a stakeout...
- Oh, God, not again!

16:24.480 --> 16:26.236
What about Seymour?

16:26.528 --> 16:30.074
What does he do with his life?
Drugs? Play Cornbread?

16:30.368 --> 16:34.459
Who can he look up to? You?
You're too involved with yourself!

16:34.656 --> 16:37.885
Go ahead, turn your back on me
like you always do!

16:38.111 --> 16:41.908
Hey, John!
It ain't gonna fall from the sky!

16:42.272 --> 16:44.890
You gotta work for what you want!

16:45.120 --> 16:49.463
Look at me, at least!
I'm yelling at you!

16:54.239 --> 16:59.029
It was about 90 degrees.
You got kids?

17:01.536 --> 17:04.885
Johnny! Sweet and sour pork
very, very good!

17:05.119 --> 17:07.837
- How'd you like the lawyer?
- Filthy. Move!

17:08.031 --> 17:09.308
You out, ain't you?

17:09.568 --> 17:12.568
Guess you won't be coming
to my concert!

17:14.720 --> 17:19.641
This is the system designed to cut
down on fraud and unpaid charges.

17:19.839 --> 17:24.476
We developed this through interviews
with 300 Dynasty Club authorizers.

17:24.734 --> 17:27.834
This computer can determine
credit approval.

17:28.031 --> 17:31.479
The computer decides
who gets credit and who doesn't?

17:31.711 --> 17:34.526
Who would have guessed? Technology.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.265
Remember when you had
to heat an iron on the stove?

17:38.495 --> 17:42.140
I have no frame of reference.
I'm a man of the computer age.

17:42.335 --> 17:44.888
- Another tough question.
- Yes?

17:45.151 --> 17:50.454
I lose my credit card. Someone finds
it and goes on a shopping spree.

17:50.655 --> 17:51.865
Please. Sit.

17:52.160 --> 17:55.542
- I'm listening.
- Does the computer pick up on that?

17:55.775 --> 18:01.274
Well, yes and no. It's harder during
Christmas, when shopping's heavier.

18:01.471 --> 18:04.253
On the whole,
it's a very effective system.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.869
Ain't that something.

18:07.135 --> 18:11.510
I hate to be so pedantic,
but it's "isn't that something."

18:12.128 --> 18:15.030
- Isn't that something?
- Yes. It's a shame.

18:15.296 --> 18:19.518
- What is?
- Mr. Forrest's death. It's a shame.

18:20.319 --> 18:23.614
Could I get a printout
of the names on that tape?

18:23.807 --> 18:26.327
Certainly. Anything else I could do?

18:26.560 --> 18:28.120
No, thank you.

18:28.992 --> 18:31.642
Thank you for the English lesson.

18:54.560 --> 18:57.527
I got what you need!
Hey, get high off this!

18:57.727 --> 19:02.234
- Yo, check it out, baby!
- Hey, nice lady!

19:02.431 --> 19:03.992
You look good!

19:04.191 --> 19:06.046
Hey, buy a book for your kid.

19:06.271 --> 19:09.533
- Tell your mommy to buy a book.
- Screw you!

19:09.760 --> 19:11.418
I'll knock you out!

19:11.615 --> 19:15.958
Customer's always right.
Folks, knowledge is the key.

19:16.255 --> 19:20.314
No one cares about children.
Why else is Bush in office?

19:20.576 --> 19:25.627
- I gotta do something. Walsh said...
- Fuck Walsh! He don't care about us!

19:25.888 --> 19:30.645
Stay here and sell these damn books!
I'm going to get paid!

19:32.479 --> 19:37.629
Ladies and gentlemen, knowledge
is the key to understanding and... Damn!

19:37.856 --> 19:39.830
We gonna get paid today!

19:40.095 --> 19:44.285
Yo, my man! Come and play
a game of three-card.

19:44.511 --> 19:47.511
Red card.
You want the red card.

19:48.447 --> 19:52.473
Excuse me? How much is this book?

19:54.688 --> 19:56.957
For you? Free, take it.

19:57.151 --> 19:59.999
- Nothing in America is free.
- Love is.

20:00.255 --> 20:03.222
- Really?
- I think your kid will like it.

20:03.488 --> 20:05.430
I don't have a kid.

20:05.631 --> 20:07.639
Yes, Lord.

20:07.872 --> 20:10.741
- Two dollars.
- What happened to free?

20:10.975 --> 20:13.528
It's America, remember?

20:13.792 --> 20:16.475
This is great. You should read it.

20:16.991 --> 20:19.838
Yeah?
Could I read it to you now?

20:20.031 --> 20:22.104
The Ice Cream Dream.

20:22.495 --> 20:24.829
Wonder what that's about.

20:25.119 --> 20:28.599
I wfsh I had fce cream

20:34.079 --> 20:37.724
You're fresh.
I'll take my book before it melts.

20:38.271 --> 20:42.646
Come again.
And again and again.

20:42.879 --> 20:45.335
Never the black.
You want the red.

20:45.535 --> 20:48.502
- I think the lady wants to play.
- All right!

20:49.855 --> 20:52.092
Make a buck, 10 gets you 20.

20:52.319 --> 20:55.996
- How do you know?
- Trust me. I sell children's books.

20:56.191 --> 20:58.013
Come on, Miss Lady Girl.

20:58.208 --> 21:02.714
Never the black, always the red!
Open your ears, and hear what I said!

21:02.911 --> 21:04.798
What you got?

21:11.967 --> 21:13.211
You sure?

21:15.359 --> 21:17.781
Yeah, she wants the right card.

21:18.079 --> 21:19.672
Bam!

21:20.351 --> 21:23.963
- We got a lucky winner, you all!
- Winner! Winner!

21:24.576 --> 21:26.550
See, it ain't impossible!
Here!

21:26.752 --> 21:29.272
Forty gets you 80!

21:29.471 --> 21:33.246
Once again, never the black!
You want the red.

21:36.575 --> 21:37.655
What you got?

21:38.175 --> 21:39.931
Middle card.

21:42.175 --> 21:44.247
You sure you want this one?

21:46.208 --> 21:49.590
- You sure?
- Come on.

21:53.280 --> 21:57.054
- She won!
- Another lucky winner!

21:57.311 --> 21:59.286
I think she won all that!

21:59.519 --> 22:01.624
Oh, you won it all!

22:02.528 --> 22:04.502
This is her lucky day!

22:04.735 --> 22:08.031
- You're gonna take the money and run?
- I won it.

22:08.992 --> 22:12.505
You sold me out for some ass?
What do I do now?

22:12.799 --> 22:17.556
- Sell those books.
- Sell some books?

22:26.880 --> 22:31.386
- Excuse me, I didn't get your name.
- Amber.

22:31.615 --> 22:34.844
Amber? I like that!
Excuse me, Miss Amber.

22:35.071 --> 22:37.624
Can we get together for lunch?

22:37.855 --> 22:40.670
- Can we get together?
- I'm busy.

22:47.040 --> 22:50.553
Hi, remember me?
How about dinner?

22:56.351 --> 22:58.904
How about breakfast?

23:04.479 --> 23:06.868
How about a drink?

23:07.135 --> 23:10.583
The water fountain's right over there.

23:12.095 --> 23:13.918
She wants me.

23:32.575 --> 23:37.244
- I'm applying for the mailroom job.
- Did you fill out an application?

23:37.439 --> 23:40.090
- No.
- Here.

23:40.607 --> 23:42.647
Fill this out.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.225
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.559
I really mean it. Good luck.

23:49.792 --> 23:52.312
Many people say that. They're crazy!

23:52.575 --> 23:57.048
They want you to have bad luck.
But I believe everyone can succeed.

23:57.247 --> 23:58.556
Homeboy!

23:59.071 --> 24:04.439
I refuse to get paranoid or hostile
in a competitive situation.

24:04.639 --> 24:08.185
I think this job is the key for me.
So does my shrink.

24:08.415 --> 24:10.652
He even lowered my prescription.

24:10.879 --> 24:14.523
I gotta conquer the whole
self-esteem thing. Boom!

24:14.719 --> 24:17.948
I have an eating disorder,
you know.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.890
- No?
- Sure. Threw up on the way over.

24:21.695 --> 24:24.281
I had a negative self-image as a kid.

24:24.575 --> 24:28.317
They think I'm fat and loathsome,
but I'll fight them.

24:28.511 --> 24:33.115
I'll show them that they can't
rob me of my right to exist!

24:33.375 --> 24:35.514
Next.

24:40.831 --> 24:42.903
Come in.

24:43.519 --> 24:44.729
Hi.

24:48.479 --> 24:53.400
Some interesting responses here,
Mr. Stewart.

24:53.887 --> 24:59.124
It says here that you attended
Mt. Holyoke College in Massachusetts.

24:59.327 --> 25:01.694
Four years of work, work, work.

25:01.919 --> 25:04.985
Isn't Mount Holyoke
an all-girls school?

25:05.215 --> 25:09.623
No, they changed that.
Probably as soon as I got there.

25:11.007 --> 25:15.349
- Are you related to Tracey Stewart?
- Yeah, that's my aunt.

25:15.551 --> 25:18.039
- He's a man.
- His wife's my aunt.

25:18.271 --> 25:21.140
You should put that
on your application.

25:21.375 --> 25:27.071
Tracey is an asset to this company.
He keeps things in order around here.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.748
Well, he's funny about nepotism.

25:29.951 --> 25:35.352
I'd rather do this on my own, so I'd
appreciate it if you didn't tell him.

25:35.615 --> 25:38.332
You certainly have personality.

25:38.559 --> 25:41.723
Listen, I'll review
your application...

25:41.951 --> 25:46.686
...check out a few references,
and get back to you in a few days.

25:47.967 --> 25:51.316
This is your correct
telephone number, isn't it?

25:51.551 --> 25:53.526
- Yes. Yes, sir.
- Good.

25:54.847 --> 25:57.051
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

25:57.919 --> 25:59.064
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

26:02.015 --> 26:04.350
Next, please. Next?

26:06.687 --> 26:08.280
Yo, big head.

26:08.479 --> 26:11.643
Yo, what took you so long?
I've been home and back.

26:11.839 --> 26:13.464
- You talk to her?
- Yeah.

26:13.695 --> 26:15.931
- Did you get her number?
- No.

26:16.159 --> 26:19.508
- So what took you so long?
- I think I got a job.

26:19.775 --> 26:21.531
- A job?
- Yeah.

26:21.727 --> 26:26.549
- Johnny, a job ain't nothing but work.
- I know. Let's eat.

26:29.727 --> 26:31.799
Calm down, Timmy. Timmy.

26:34.079 --> 26:36.664
Stop it, now. Calm down. Calm down.

26:36.927 --> 26:39.677
What are you doing?
Get him out.

26:39.935 --> 26:42.750
- Mister, I forgot his...
- Get him out!

26:43.007 --> 26:46.749
I forgot his medicine at home.
Don't touch the eggs.

26:47.007 --> 26:49.462
No, no, not the eggs, my God.

26:49.695 --> 26:53.372
Get him out.
Let him die in the street like a dog.

26:53.599 --> 26:56.152
Don't talk. See? Look at that.

26:56.415 --> 26:59.284
- Not the eggs.
- What do you want me to do?

26:59.551 --> 27:01.373
Get turkey. He needs lactate.

27:01.567 --> 27:03.192
- Laxative?
- No, lactate.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.521
Fix him a turkey sandwich.
Hurry, he's crazy.

27:06.719 --> 27:08.442
Timmy, not the cans, no!

27:08.639 --> 27:11.224
Not my cans. What are you doing?

27:11.455 --> 27:13.942
Okay, I fix, I fix.
Here. Here.

27:14.239 --> 27:19.127
Put more on, that's not enough
lactate. Timmy wants more lactate.

27:19.391 --> 27:23.068
Don't touch those chips.
Don't touch the cakes.

27:24.767 --> 27:27.156
Timmy, stop it.
Beep-beep-beep-beep.

27:27.391 --> 27:31.547
- What's this "beep-beep"?
- Put some more turkey and mayo on.

27:31.807 --> 27:35.036
A whole lot of mayo.
Thank you, mister.

27:35.294 --> 27:36.636
Timmy, stop it.

27:36.831 --> 27:39.416
Mayo. Here's more mayo. Mayo, here.

27:39.615 --> 27:41.437
Thank you, thank you.

27:41.631 --> 27:46.868
You're welcome. Now get him out.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

27:47.135 --> 27:49.688
- Give him a kiss.
- Please go!

27:49.919 --> 27:52.636
Get out of here. Get out, now.

27:52.895 --> 27:56.026
- Get him out of my store.
- And be more happy.

28:06.559 --> 28:11.131
How long does a coroner's report take?
We'll be dead when it comes.

28:11.327 --> 28:12.374
I've tried...

28:12.575 --> 28:17.943
Get over there, even if you have to
examine the damn body yourself. Go.

28:18.207 --> 28:20.247
Remember the trouble you caused?

28:20.447 --> 28:24.473
Get your hands off me, you
bald-headed, flatfoot faggot!

28:24.671 --> 28:29.308
You were my best customer! Busting
me because I won't do you for free?

28:29.535 --> 28:34.324
- Right, liar. Come on!
- Get that whore away from my door.

28:34.559 --> 28:39.294
- You see what you started, Mary?
- What happened to us?

28:39.647 --> 28:43.225
Lieutenant? I just got off
the phone with the lab.

28:43.454 --> 28:46.803
Autopsy confirms Forrest's broken
neck wasn't from the accident.

28:47.007 --> 28:48.730
- I said that.
- It happened...

28:48.927 --> 28:51.163
After the fact. It's official.

28:51.390 --> 28:51.423
So, anyway. Everybody's laughing
and having fun.

28:51.423 --> 28:54.652
So, anyway. Everybody's laughing
and having fun.

28:54.878 --> 28:58.227
When all of a sudden,
Sandy jump up and run out!

28:58.527 --> 29:01.625
Child! He done forgot his Depends!

29:01.854 --> 29:03.643
Hey! Miss! Miss!

29:03.839 --> 29:06.359
Could you hurry?
I'm waiting on a call.

29:06.559 --> 29:09.079
I don't give a rat's ass!

29:09.374 --> 29:14.044
I put 25 cents in here. When
it's used up, then I hang up!

29:14.239 --> 29:16.889
We've waited two days
for the phone to ring!

29:17.087 --> 29:19.836
That's because Moms Mabley
won't hang up!

29:20.031 --> 29:22.453
He's gonna call. I got a feeling.

29:22.655 --> 29:25.241
I got a feeling they hired somebody.

29:25.439 --> 29:28.254
You just want to be around
that stupid girl!

29:28.478 --> 29:31.827
You think they're gonna hire
a convicted criminal?

29:32.031 --> 29:33.307
I ain't John Gotti!

29:33.534 --> 29:36.633
You sure ain't.
John Gotti was getting paid!

29:37.214 --> 29:41.273
- Now you can use the phone!
- Thanks. Hey, my man! It's broken.

29:41.471 --> 29:44.253
Go shave that crust-ache off your lip.

29:46.271 --> 29:48.474
See? It still ain't ringing.

29:52.799 --> 29:56.148
Get away from my cab!
Get a job! Join a union!

29:56.351 --> 29:58.391
Join a Boy's Club!

29:58.590 --> 30:00.925
See that cab over there?

30:15.007 --> 30:19.285
Maybe you can help me. I need to get
to 33rd Street and 3rd Avenue.

30:19.487 --> 30:21.723
Let me guess,
not from around here?

30:21.919 --> 30:25.629
- My bald head gave me away?
- I'll whiz you over there. $50.

30:25.887 --> 30:29.531
- I won't even turn on the metre.
- I don't have money.

30:29.727 --> 30:33.621
- You fucking immigrant!
- But, wait. Excuse me!

30:33.919 --> 30:38.490
Hello? Excuse me?
I got to go get the money.

30:38.847 --> 30:39.829
What money?

30:40.030 --> 30:42.878
I have $10,000 at
my grandmother's house.

30:43.071 --> 30:45.438
My time is worth money.
$200, on spec.

30:45.630 --> 30:47.485
$200!

30:54.111 --> 30:56.413
$150, I give you $150...

30:57.535 --> 30:58.877
I told you he'd call!

30:59.070 --> 31:02.332
You son of a bitch!
I'll rip your throat out!

31:03.678 --> 31:07.126
Stewart residence.
Yes, this is him.

31:07.391 --> 31:09.278
Yes, tomorrow will be fine.

31:10.046 --> 31:12.829
Thank you. Thank you very much.

31:13.055 --> 31:15.477
Yes! I got the job!

31:16.319 --> 31:18.424
- I got a job, man!
- Filthy!

31:32.478 --> 31:37.530
You must be Jonathan Stewart.
I'm your supervisor, Chris Fields.

31:37.726 --> 31:41.468
Everyone! I'd like to introduce you
to a new employee today.

31:41.726 --> 31:43.832
His name is Jonathan Stewart!

31:44.319 --> 31:45.748
Hi, Johnny baby!

31:46.014 --> 31:48.087
By the way, that's Charlotte.

31:48.319 --> 31:51.931
Come on. I'll introduce you
to your machine.

31:53.246 --> 31:56.149
Keep going. You're doing good.

31:56.511 --> 32:01.268
- You better get used to paper cuts.
- I'll get gloves or something.

32:01.534 --> 32:03.477
What do I do with this?

32:04.639 --> 32:07.955
That's a credit card that
Mr. Jeffrey wants cancelled.

32:08.190 --> 32:10.874
Idiot didn't break it in half.
He's supposed to.

32:11.134 --> 32:14.233
- Why is that?
- Our cards go out pre-approved.

32:14.431 --> 32:18.359
They have to be processed before
they can be cancelled.

32:18.558 --> 32:20.119
I see we got a new guy.

32:20.318 --> 32:23.799
Johnny, this is Keith Heading.
He's head of security.

32:23.999 --> 32:25.625
- Hi.
- Hi, Johnny.

32:27.071 --> 32:30.333
Hear the one about the guy
who goes to a psychiatrist?

32:30.559 --> 32:32.948
"I'm having weird dreams.
Last night I was a wigwam.

32:33.150 --> 32:38.201
The night before I was a tepee."
Psychiatrist says, "You're two tents."

32:43.518 --> 32:45.974
- Chris, you got a minute?
- Sure.

32:46.175 --> 32:48.477
- Excuse us. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

32:48.735 --> 32:53.077
Hey, Johnny baby!
What are you doing for lunch?

32:53.374 --> 32:55.033
- Working.
- On who?

32:56.510 --> 33:00.253
- You've got the most beautiful lips!
- Oh, really?

33:04.478 --> 33:05.852
Chris, come here.

33:08.447 --> 33:12.244
- How about the new guy?
- Johnny's great. He'll stick around.

33:12.510 --> 33:13.492
I gotta poop.

33:13.695 --> 33:15.833
What the fuck is going on?

33:17.439 --> 33:19.959
- I got scared.
- Scared of what?

33:20.479 --> 33:23.228
What are you scared of?
Have a nightmare?

33:24.734 --> 33:28.924
- I don't have time for a scare.
- I didn't know people would be hurt or...

33:29.598 --> 33:31.322
- Or what?
- Or dying.

33:31.518 --> 33:35.031
Well, Mr. Butthole, you let him be
a lesson to you.

33:35.999 --> 33:39.927
We got 26 days to make
30 million dollars.

33:40.191 --> 33:42.263
People are waiting on product.

33:43.134 --> 33:44.661
You know what I mean?

33:46.110 --> 33:48.020
Nod if you understand.

33:49.631 --> 33:52.446
Oh, you're red. You're getting blue.

33:52.638 --> 33:55.224
I wonder how long it takes
to get white?

33:55.487 --> 33:58.651
Christ! I gotta get
back to my office.

34:00.031 --> 34:02.038
You get me those cards, okay?

34:08.254 --> 34:12.313
Hey, don't forget!
You're my number one guy.

34:23.391 --> 34:24.918
Terry! How are you?

34:41.054 --> 34:45.495
- Yo, Chris? That you?
- Yeah.

34:45.694 --> 34:48.476
Why you crying, man?
You constipated?

34:50.911 --> 34:54.652
You should try rocking back and forth.
That's what I do.

34:59.199 --> 35:03.933
You said it would take an hour.
It's been longer. That's unacceptable.

35:05.727 --> 35:07.832
Allison, file this, please.

35:10.431 --> 35:12.886
What happens if I push this button?

35:13.086 --> 35:15.542
- How did you get in here?
- I work here.

35:15.775 --> 35:18.677
- What can I do for you?
- It's my lunch break.

35:18.878 --> 35:21.267
I'm looking for
someone nice to talk to.

35:21.726 --> 35:26.036
Maybe show me around.
You wouldn't happen to know someone?

35:28.286 --> 35:30.196
- Actually, yes. I do.
- Yeah?

35:30.431 --> 35:32.285
Yeah. Charlotte.

35:33.919 --> 35:38.708
Right. What do you do in
this department?

35:39.454 --> 35:41.723
- Don't sit on my desk.
- Sorry.

35:41.918 --> 35:43.347
I run this department.

35:43.550 --> 35:47.162
Why don't you hook me up
so I can leave the mailroom?

35:47.359 --> 35:51.865
Acquisitions is having babies
about the C-89 form. Finished?

35:52.126 --> 35:54.101
- Yes.
- What's happening, bro?

35:55.230 --> 35:58.678
- What are you?
- Jonathan Stewart, from Acquisitions.

35:58.910 --> 36:03.220
Came to get the C-89 form.
I'll have this down to them.

36:04.447 --> 36:07.829
- Did you put aside those disputes?
- Yes, I did.

36:14.495 --> 36:17.145
- Hi, Johnny baby!
- What's up, Charlotte?

36:17.375 --> 36:20.375
- How was your first day?
- I'm learning.

36:20.574 --> 36:23.029
What you need is a better teacher.

36:23.294 --> 36:25.945
I could probably get it. It's easy.

36:26.207 --> 36:29.851
You need someone to show
you how to do it right.

36:30.078 --> 36:34.333
Listen, I'm going to the bar right
down the street.

36:34.559 --> 36:40.342
- You wanna come?
- No. I'm gonna pass. I'll pass.

36:40.606 --> 36:42.973
Too bad.

36:43.614 --> 36:46.811
- I think she likes you.
- I think I like you.

36:47.006 --> 36:50.072
- Johnny! Johnny, right?
- What's up, Keith?

36:50.271 --> 36:52.376
- How you doing?
- What's happening?

36:52.574 --> 36:56.153
- Good night, Chris. See you later.
- Good night.

36:57.406 --> 37:02.163
- He hasn't been feeling good.
- I know, he was constipated earlier.

37:10.558 --> 37:13.209
Hello, my weakness. How you doing?

37:13.407 --> 37:15.828
- I was waiting for you inside.
- Why?

37:16.094 --> 37:20.185
I wanted to ask you to marry me.
Can I get down on one knee?

37:20.479 --> 37:25.781
- My boyfriend wouldn't like that.
- Oh, you got a boyfriend and things!

37:26.014 --> 37:28.829
All right. We'll let him
be the best man.

37:29.119 --> 37:31.769
- I don't think so.
- No?

37:32.414 --> 37:36.538
- I love your smile. It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

37:36.734 --> 37:40.379
Amber! Amber, let's go!

37:40.574 --> 37:43.542
- I have to go.
- That's your boss friend?

37:44.350 --> 37:48.627
- Does he treat you like he should?
- Amber, let's go!

37:48.831 --> 37:50.521
I didn't think so.

37:50.910 --> 37:55.961
It's okay. He's temporary.
I got plans for you and me.

38:01.438 --> 38:03.543
I gotta get my shit together.

38:08.158 --> 38:11.868
- So, what were you two talking about?
- Nothing.

38:12.127 --> 38:16.884
- It looked like more than nothing.
- He works in Acquisitions...

38:17.119 --> 38:20.981
No, he doesn't. I checked.
Don't waste time with trash.

38:21.215 --> 38:25.754
- What does that mean?
- He's beneath you. Don't talk to him.

38:26.015 --> 38:30.357
- What, are you jealous?
- That's absurd. Just don't talk to him.

39:41.534 --> 39:46.390
I've got great news.
I've got tickets to the opera tonight.

39:49.054 --> 39:53.942
- Amber, you don't seem pleased.
- When will we do something I want?

39:54.174 --> 39:59.957
Things you wanna do have no culture.
Open your mind to more than rap music.

40:03.550 --> 40:06.168
- Here is your other spoon.
- Thank you.

40:06.398 --> 40:09.944
And could we have two more baskets
of raisin bread?

40:10.654 --> 40:12.410
Thank you.

40:13.758 --> 40:16.246
- Yo, that's her man?
- Yeah.

40:16.446 --> 40:21.400
- Yo, he's filthy!
- I know. Watch this.

40:25.278 --> 40:31.639
I've got a joke. Why did the black
man wear a tuxedo to his vasectomy?

40:34.430 --> 40:38.259
If he was gonna be impotent,
he wanted to look impotent.

40:41.631 --> 40:44.892
Keith Heading told me that joke!

40:52.158 --> 40:55.955
Amber, it's not that funny.
What are you laughing at?

40:56.734 --> 40:58.458
Tom...

40:58.654 --> 41:00.989
Time for fun with the mailboy.

41:01.246 --> 41:03.384
What do you want, man?

41:03.614 --> 41:07.159
Stop it! Stop it! Stop!
Tom, you're overreacting.

41:07.390 --> 41:12.758
You're right. Why am I being insecure?
He can't afford you. Right, Amber?

41:21.310 --> 41:24.954
Here. Why don't you get yourself
a decent meal, boy?

41:25.726 --> 41:27.515
Thanks. Johnny!

41:27.710 --> 41:31.769
- How was I supposed to react?
- Not by treating me like a whore!

41:31.966 --> 41:36.122
- You're being irrational.
- I want out of this relationship!

41:36.478 --> 41:40.951
Fine. Just collect your things
and go back to the projects.

41:49.534 --> 41:49.630
- I should've broke his back!
- You're tough.

41:49.630 --> 41:52.314
- I should've broke his back!
- You're tough.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.609
Should've punched him right
in his face!

41:55.806 --> 41:57.879
You should've, but didn't.

41:58.078 --> 41:59.988
- What?
- Nothing!

42:00.254 --> 42:01.628
- Say it!
- Nothing.

42:01.886 --> 42:04.155
- Say it!
- You played yourself!

42:04.414 --> 42:07.763
He's a top-level executive.
I'd have lost my job!

42:07.998 --> 42:10.551
But you would've still had your face!

42:11.006 --> 42:13.527
Shut up, Doodle-tooth.
You're no help.

42:13.726 --> 42:18.167
Look at your three-dollar jeans,
two-dollar shirt and tie!

42:18.398 --> 42:22.675
What's that, a 12-dollar outfit?
And a bottlecap for a hat!

42:22.910 --> 42:25.943
That shit look like a yarmulke
with a brim!

42:26.846 --> 42:31.036
Changing your image with a job
ain't gonna get you no girl!

42:31.294 --> 42:34.393
A job ain't nothing but work!

42:34.718 --> 42:39.704
Besides, she's a money-hungry ho!
Why do you think her eyes are green?

42:41.598 --> 42:43.223
No, she's not.

42:44.030 --> 42:46.005
Shut up.

42:46.206 --> 42:50.167
Doodle-tooth. Call me... My breath...

42:51.038 --> 42:54.649
- That's kind of funny. You bottle...
- I said, shut up!

43:22.014 --> 43:26.236
Thank you very much for helping me
with the investigation.

43:26.494 --> 43:29.080
Tell me if I can be
of any more help.

43:29.310 --> 43:33.139
Actually, there is one thing
that you can do for me.

43:34.430 --> 43:36.186
Grocery list.

43:36.478 --> 43:39.478
I'm looking for Chris Fields?
You know him?

43:39.710 --> 43:43.125
He's a good worker.
A real asset to the company.

43:43.326 --> 43:47.287
- Don't know what we'd do without him.
- Do you know where he is?

43:47.518 --> 43:48.980
Chris?

43:51.294 --> 43:54.393
- Would you mind if l...?
- Wanna use my office?

43:54.590 --> 43:56.412
- Would you?
- Go ahead.

43:56.606 --> 43:59.388
- Lieutenant Walsh.
- Nice to meet you.

43:59.646 --> 44:02.745
- He wants to talk to you.
- A few questions.

44:03.006 --> 44:05.723
About what?

44:05.918 --> 44:08.307
- Don't worry.
- Life.

44:08.574 --> 44:10.745
- How you doing, Chris?
- Not bad.

44:10.974 --> 44:13.657
- How do you like this office?
- It's great.

44:15.646 --> 44:20.250
Nothing. He just asked me a bunch
of questions about the mailroom.

44:20.446 --> 44:24.756
- Did he ask anything about me?
- A couple of things.

44:25.054 --> 44:28.949
- What did he ask?
- Just who you were.

44:29.758 --> 44:34.101
- What did you say?
- Nothing! I played dumb.

44:35.934 --> 44:40.571
I knew the cops would ffnd <u>out.</u>
Thfs fs gettfng way <u>out of hand...</u>

44:40.766 --> 44:44.476
Lfsten, lfsten. <u>You</u> dfd real <u>good.</u>
<u>Dont</u> worry.

44:44.669 --> 44:47.833
<u>Just go</u> home and III <u>take</u> care
<u>of ft,</u> okay?

44:48.094 --> 44:49.949
All <u>rfght.</u>

44:54.654 --> 45:01.048
Sasha! The things we did aren't even
in books! She had a set of headlights...

45:01.246 --> 45:07.607
You've got to be careful of who
you take to bed! There are diseases!

45:07.838 --> 45:13.206
Only the guys who aren't getting laid
are thinking about what they can get.

45:13.406 --> 45:18.228
- Right, fellas?
- Oh, you absolutely right, Mr. Man.

45:18.430 --> 45:22.204
Hi! We'd like to see
your jewels, please.

45:22.494 --> 45:25.625
What jewel is it
that you'd like to see?

45:25.886 --> 45:29.235
- That one.
- This one?

45:29.470 --> 45:34.260
- No, the big one. I likes them big.
- I see.

45:34.526 --> 45:36.414
All right.

45:40.670 --> 45:44.761
- Look at this! It's the cutest thing.
- Let me see it!

45:44.990 --> 45:49.846
- Stop, you act like a little mosquito.
- You didn't say that last night.

45:50.046 --> 45:53.941
Little Miss Thing, you were
a mosquito somewhere else.

45:54.238 --> 45:57.140
Anyways, how much
is something like this?

45:57.438 --> 46:02.009
Well, that ring, sir, is $3000.
Do you like it?

46:02.238 --> 46:04.791
Like it? I loves it!

46:05.758 --> 46:07.319
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

46:07.550 --> 46:10.866
- I gotta talk to my husband first.
- Get a haircut.

46:11.069 --> 46:12.564
Excuse me, husband!

46:12.798 --> 46:15.547
Sometimes I feel like a nut,
sometimes I don't!

46:15.773 --> 46:18.162
Sometimes I feel like slapping you!

46:18.397 --> 46:21.943
Husband said I could put it
on my Dynasty Club Card.

46:22.174 --> 46:24.760
- Great.
- He's so good to me.

46:24.958 --> 46:27.958
- Now, what you whining about?
- You hit me!

46:28.766 --> 46:34.395
There you are. Oh, of course,
I will need to see a driver's license.

46:36.478 --> 46:38.366
Look, you gave me your cold!

46:38.557 --> 46:43.162
What should I do? Run out the
store every time I open my mouth?

46:44.638 --> 46:49.427
- Here you go. Pardon me!
- Why don't you just read it to me?

46:49.629 --> 46:53.404
Certainly. Zero, six,
nine, one, three...

46:53.630 --> 46:58.201
...D- l-C-K. Expires whenever.

47:05.150 --> 47:08.761
There you are, gentlemen.
Enjoy your ring.

47:08.990 --> 47:11.226
Ain't he so sweet?

47:11.453 --> 47:14.236
- I'm sorry. Did we get you?
- No, no.

47:14.429 --> 47:16.153
Bye, doughboy.

47:21.470 --> 47:24.568
- We got stuck!
- Bye-bye!

47:26.653 --> 47:29.555
Bye! Hope you wash your face!

47:32.958 --> 47:34.714
Now that shit was sweet!

47:34.910 --> 47:37.299
We could sell that and get $100.

47:37.566 --> 47:40.763
$100? That's crackhead prices!
I'm keeping it.

47:40.957 --> 47:42.364
- For her?
- Yeah.

47:42.558 --> 47:47.479
You better get that girl a mood ring.
Then get me a leather jacket.

47:47.677 --> 47:50.427
- Just a jacket.
- And a hat.

47:50.686 --> 47:53.719
- And a hat.
- No. And a shirt!

47:54.334 --> 47:58.393
And a tigerskin blanket.
And some snakeskin drawers.

48:21.758 --> 48:23.765
Take a look at that.

48:33.853 --> 48:38.971
Mo' Money! Mo' Money! Mo' Money!

48:43.390 --> 48:46.968
- Amber-Poo? Open the door. It's Tom.
- Go away!

48:47.166 --> 48:50.482
Amber, open the door!
I just wanna talk to you!

48:50.685 --> 48:54.166
- Amber?
- I have nothing to say. It's over!

48:54.398 --> 48:59.035
You're being irrational! If I was the
mailboy, you'd open the door!

48:59.294 --> 49:05.142
Yes, I would! He's nice to me. He
doesn't treat me like a piece of shit!

49:05.853 --> 49:07.959
I've got a joke for you.

49:08.317 --> 49:12.572
What does a man with a one-inch penis
have for breakfast?

49:12.830 --> 49:19.223
You give up? This morning I had
baby food and therapy. Lots of it.

49:20.957 --> 49:24.754
Keith Heading told me that joke!

49:26.238 --> 49:29.533
- How'd you know where I live?
- I followed you.

49:29.726 --> 49:33.687
- You followed me?
- My dreams need detail.

49:33.918 --> 49:37.944
- So, what do you want?
- I brought you something.

49:39.838 --> 49:41.943
Where is it?

50:16.958 --> 50:18.900
Go ahead, man.

50:24.829 --> 50:28.506
- Hey, fatso!
- You're gonna have a heart attack!

51:10.845 --> 51:12.634
Give me your wallet! Now!

51:13.246 --> 51:14.489
Here!

51:31.134 --> 51:33.468
Here today, gone tomorrow.

51:33.693 --> 51:38.101
- I found this. His name was...
- Chris Fields.

51:38.333 --> 51:43.767
- Darren Clinton, Lloyd Bradley...
- Here, let me see that.

51:46.558 --> 51:48.892
Boy, this kid had credit.

51:49.630 --> 51:53.940
Stealing? Man, that's ridiculous.

51:56.413 --> 52:00.406
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, no.

52:00.606 --> 52:06.552
No, no. Not one, not two,
but three Cartier watches.

52:07.453 --> 52:10.749
Five Italian suits from Elite Wear.

52:11.198 --> 52:13.848
Flight Limousine Service.

52:14.078 --> 52:19.544
Let's see. Dinner at Lu Chow's.
Yum yum, dim sum.

52:20.158 --> 52:22.973
Oh, the list goes on and on.

52:23.486 --> 52:25.558
You got good taste.

52:25.758 --> 52:30.744
- I don't know whose list that is, but...
- I love this part.

52:32.830 --> 52:39.289
Hey! That looks just like you!
Wait a minute. That is you!

52:43.229 --> 52:45.946
You know that's a federal offense?

52:46.430 --> 52:49.364
See, I had you checked out,
Johnny Boy.

52:51.230 --> 52:55.452
You're on probation, right? Right?

52:57.246 --> 53:02.167
I put the cards there.
It was just a matter of time.

53:04.766 --> 53:06.838
I'm a good judge of character.

53:07.038 --> 53:10.551
What are you gonna do?
Are you calling the cops?

53:10.749 --> 53:16.565
No, I hired you!
I do my affirmative action bit.

53:19.166 --> 53:23.159
Besides, it wouldn't benefit
either one of us.

53:23.389 --> 53:25.942
I got something much better in mind.

53:29.278 --> 53:33.882
Look through returned credit cards
and bring me these names.

53:36.573 --> 53:38.744
What if I don't?

53:40.125 --> 53:43.541
You go to jail for a long time.

53:44.253 --> 53:47.515
Now, get out of my face.
I hate thieves.

54:03.997 --> 54:08.187
What you all standing around for?
It looks like somebody died.

54:08.638 --> 54:13.940
It's Chris. He got stabbed
to death last night.

54:14.398 --> 54:19.515
Damn! I'm sorry to hear that.

54:21.629 --> 54:23.963
Excuse me, everyone.

54:24.637 --> 54:29.940
Due to an unfortunate episode last
night, Chris is no longer with us.

54:30.653 --> 54:37.047
I've just been informed that Jonathan
Stewart will be his replacement.

54:38.046 --> 54:42.552
Good luck. You're the number one guy.

54:47.549 --> 54:49.272
- Over?
- Over.

54:49.533 --> 54:52.916
What? This is the easiest
shit we ever did!

54:53.117 --> 54:57.787
- It's over? Are you crazy?
- I don't wanna do it anymore.

54:58.077 --> 55:01.754
You don't want to do it anymore?!
Come on, man.

55:01.949 --> 55:05.691
Do you know how much is out there
that we didn't get?

55:05.917 --> 55:10.554
I saw this four-finger ring that said
"Seymour" and "Johnny."

55:10.749 --> 55:14.742
- They come with thumb attachments.
- Sound like handcuffs.

55:14.974 --> 55:18.421
Come on, man.
I saw a crocodile sweatsuit.

55:18.685 --> 55:21.107
You gonna play ball in the jungle?

55:21.373 --> 55:24.243
Why you bullshitting?
We could get paid!

55:24.509 --> 55:27.226
It's not like they're gonna find out...

55:27.454 --> 55:30.520
They did find out!
Now Keith's blackmailing me.

55:30.717 --> 55:33.401
So just leave it alone. It's over.

55:35.134 --> 55:38.745
I guess you don't want to hear
about the mink socks!

55:41.437 --> 55:43.226
Get that meat out of here!

55:44.445 --> 55:46.681
I just don't understand this.

55:46.910 --> 55:49.844
- What don't you understand?
- The whole thing.

55:50.077 --> 55:52.663
Could you explain the system again?

55:52.926 --> 55:55.959
- A credit line...
- That part I get.

55:56.158 --> 55:59.540
There's information
on everyone's spending patterns.

55:59.805 --> 56:04.507
- Computers reject abnormal purchases.
- "Abnormal purchases."

56:04.733 --> 56:05.715
What?

56:05.917 --> 56:09.692
I found these receipts
on the late Chris Fields.

56:09.885 --> 56:14.358
Look, there's some really big
purchases here. $30,000. $72,000.

56:14.557 --> 56:17.208
I checked these
against my printout...

56:17.437 --> 56:22.172
...and the funny thing is,
every one of them are deceased.

56:23.229 --> 56:28.150
So, I asked myself,
"Do dead people shop?"

56:29.150 --> 56:32.411
That fat mailroom clerk
got into the system.

56:32.605 --> 56:35.027
Ain't that something?

56:44.797 --> 56:48.758
- You're right on time. I like that.
- Here's your cards.

56:49.373 --> 56:53.879
Johnny. This is great.
This is really good.

56:54.077 --> 56:56.281
We got some shopping to do.

56:57.629 --> 57:01.110
You said all I had to do was
get you the cards.

57:01.309 --> 57:03.960
Johnny, I lie a lot.

57:04.957 --> 57:07.161
Come on. This is gonna be fun.

57:20.157 --> 57:23.540
- I like that hat.
- Kiss my ass.

57:24.509 --> 57:28.284
Don't be sad. Life's good,
you just need direction.

57:28.573 --> 57:32.402
- You're gonna take care of me, right?
- You with me?

57:35.389 --> 57:36.950
Tom?

57:50.493 --> 57:51.955
Johnny.

57:53.278 --> 57:54.739
Come on.

58:00.285 --> 58:02.871
That stuff doesn't concern you.

58:03.133 --> 58:07.540
The only thing that concerns you
is this list and this card.

58:09.117 --> 58:12.565
Be nice.
Get some clothes too, will you?

58:12.829 --> 58:15.764
You're in the big time now. Charge it.

58:20.189 --> 58:21.749
John.

58:24.189 --> 58:26.556
If you fuck me...

58:27.549 --> 58:29.753
...l'll kill you.

01:00:06.397 --> 01:00:09.943
You're going out again?
I'm supposed to just stay in?

01:00:12.605 --> 01:00:17.362
All you care about is that
stupid girl, and that stupid job!

01:00:17.565 --> 01:00:20.948
- We don't hang anymore!
- I took you to the dentist.

01:00:21.149 --> 01:00:25.753
That was five hours of pain.
That's not my idea of hanging out.

01:00:25.949 --> 01:00:29.746
You're whipped.
And you're letting her divide us.

01:00:30.012 --> 01:00:32.401
I hate that stupid girl.

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:34.553
- Get the door.
- You get it.

01:00:34.749 --> 01:00:37.367
Get the door, Dolemite.

01:00:45.853 --> 01:00:47.762
Hi, cutie.

01:00:48.285 --> 01:00:50.325
- What?
- I got my tooth pulled.

01:00:50.525 --> 01:00:52.947
Oh, poor baby.

01:00:57.565 --> 01:01:00.412
- Hey, you ready?
- Yeah.

01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:02.962
Bye.

01:01:04.893 --> 01:01:09.682
- Do you wanna come dancing with us?
- And be a sixth toe? No.

01:01:09.917 --> 01:01:12.951
She's got a sister
that looks just like her.

01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:14.871
Wait. Let me get dressed.

01:01:16.317 --> 01:01:19.830
- You sure they're sisters?
- They got different fathers.

01:01:20.029 --> 01:01:24.568
- Who's her father, Godzilla?
- Get to know her inner beauty.

01:01:24.797 --> 01:01:28.474
They're with me.
She's been following me all night.

01:01:28.669 --> 01:01:29.847
Come on in.

01:01:30.045 --> 01:01:32.248
- She's my cousin.
- That's my song.

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:41.944
- I'm going to the bathroom!
- Hurry up! This is my jam!

01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:43.957
Sisters! They ain't even friends. They
don't even live on the same block.

01:02:57.117 --> 01:03:01.427
I always let Johnny do this to me.
Why am I in this damn thing?

01:03:01.629 --> 01:03:04.149
She don't look that bad.

01:03:04.797 --> 01:03:06.739
I must be drunk.

01:03:08.412 --> 01:03:11.544
I always let this man
talk me into this.

01:04:15.389 --> 01:04:18.738
- Loverboy. I'm out.
- You're out?

01:04:18.973 --> 01:04:24.155
- You taking Godzuki with you?
- That's not funny. She's good people.

01:04:24.412 --> 01:04:28.569
- All right, drunken Casanova. See you.
- Maybe.

01:04:28.797 --> 01:04:31.448
Thanks for the hookup, Amber.

01:04:31.677 --> 01:04:36.347
- I'm gonna rock your world.
- I heard that.

01:04:36.796 --> 01:04:39.960
Excuse me. That'll be $6.50, please.

01:04:42.717 --> 01:04:44.756
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:04:45.757 --> 01:04:47.764
What is that?

01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:52.572
A black titty with a frozen nipple.
You want some?

01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:55.993
No, the money.
Where'd you get that from?

01:04:56.253 --> 01:04:58.391
I hit the lottery.

01:04:59.484 --> 01:05:05.627
You've been spending money like water.
I wasn't gonna say anything.

01:05:05.885 --> 01:05:09.365
- Please tell me it's not drugs.
- It's not drugs.

01:05:09.565 --> 01:05:12.761
- I'm serious!
- I am too. It's not drugs!

01:05:12.989 --> 01:05:16.022
- Look, I'm doing it for you.
- For me?

01:05:16.317 --> 01:05:22.481
Okay, for us. I like taking you out
to nice places. Buying you things.

01:05:22.749 --> 01:05:27.004
- I want to give you what you want.
- I have everything I want.

01:05:27.293 --> 01:05:30.162
Don't throw that away, okay?

01:05:56.349 --> 01:05:58.553
I didn't.

01:05:59.356 --> 01:06:02.739
Oh, my God. I gotta
get this girl out of here.

01:06:02.973 --> 01:06:04.566
Damn. Fire?

01:06:04.764 --> 01:06:07.186
- Fire, Charlotte! Fire!
- Where?

01:06:07.453 --> 01:06:10.966
- It's coming! It's coming!
- I don't see no smoke!

01:06:11.165 --> 01:06:13.369
There's smoke! Here, go!

01:06:13.565 --> 01:06:16.150
- What about you?
- I'll be okay!

01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:19.513
If you see a fire, stop, drop,
and roll! Go!

01:06:22.077 --> 01:06:25.426
- What?
- How am I supposed to get home?

01:06:25.628 --> 01:06:27.123
Hold on!

01:06:27.548 --> 01:06:29.937
- Seymour!
- Hold on!

01:06:31.677 --> 01:06:33.204
Here.

01:06:36.092 --> 01:06:39.769
- Two dollars?
- Take the train!

01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:52.572
Well, well, well.
Look what we got here.

01:06:57.148 --> 01:07:00.825
My man. Still haven't learned
to knock, but that's cool.

01:07:01.052 --> 01:07:02.994
- Keith, I want out.
- Say what?

01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:07.669
- I said, I want out.
- What are you scared of?

01:07:08.765 --> 01:07:09.943
Nothing.

01:07:10.236 --> 01:07:14.327
I got you the promotion.
You're making that extra money.

01:07:14.525 --> 01:07:17.394
You got that nice girlfriend.

01:07:18.428 --> 01:07:22.738
- I don't understand.
- Yeah, you wouldn't.

01:07:22.972 --> 01:07:27.544
- I know when to throw in my cards.
- I guess I was wrong about you.

01:07:27.805 --> 01:07:29.714
Yep, I guess so.

01:07:33.628 --> 01:07:36.727
Fine.

01:07:39.325 --> 01:07:44.562
<u>Its</u> a stolen card. Detafn the
cardholder? <u>Securfty</u> fs <u>on fts</u> way.

01:07:49.629 --> 01:07:51.767
Stop, you son of a bitch!

01:07:58.269 --> 01:08:01.564
I'm gonna kick your ass!
Come here, boy!

01:08:01.757 --> 01:08:04.310
- Flatfoot!
- Give me my ring!

01:08:04.508 --> 01:08:06.166
You fat bat!

01:08:14.012 --> 01:08:18.104
- Very funny!
- This is Detective Lawrence.

01:08:18.363 --> 01:08:21.265
He wants to know
where you got this card.

01:08:21.532 --> 01:08:26.582
- Maybe I'll shove my foot up his ass.
- How tough are you without the cuffs?

01:08:26.844 --> 01:08:29.233
All right, you got a deal.

01:08:29.468 --> 01:08:32.665
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:08:32.892 --> 01:08:34.964
All right, come on. Go for it!

01:08:35.165 --> 01:08:40.948
We know that this card came through
the mailroom at the Dynasty Club.

01:08:41.243 --> 01:08:46.394
Your brother Jonathan works for them.
We figure he gave you the card.

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:50.390
- He didn't give it to me.
- Where'd you get it?

01:08:50.587 --> 01:08:52.563
- A white guy.
- What's his name?

01:08:52.764 --> 01:08:56.921
I don't know. They all look alike
and smell like bologna.

01:08:57.148 --> 01:09:01.523
I'm gonna kill this
son of a bitch! Now you tell me!

01:09:01.788 --> 01:09:05.683
Tell me what you know,
or I'll beat it out of you!

01:09:05.917 --> 01:09:08.819
- Now, talk, damn you!
- All right!

01:09:09.084 --> 01:09:12.946
I know this dude, his name is Keith.
Keith Heading.

01:09:19.165 --> 01:09:20.823
Here's the deal.

01:09:21.085 --> 01:09:24.500
I know this guy
who owns six travel agencies.

01:09:24.796 --> 01:09:30.513
He wants to use your phony credit
cards to buy full-price plane tickets.

01:09:30.716 --> 01:09:35.953
Then he'll sell those at a lower fare
than other agencies can offer.

01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:39.221
He's willing to be 50-50
partners with you...

01:09:39.515 --> 01:09:44.023
...or give you $25,000 a card!

01:09:44.828 --> 01:09:47.000
25 G!

01:09:47.228 --> 01:09:48.984
There's no risk for you.

01:09:49.243 --> 01:09:52.179
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:09:57.148 --> 01:10:00.410
Look, Keith.
Johnny told me everything.

01:10:00.636 --> 01:10:02.971
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:10:03.196 --> 01:10:07.768
- You can't beat this with a bat!
- Oh, listen to this.

01:10:08.029 --> 01:10:10.746
If you're not the top guy,
tell me who is!

01:10:10.972 --> 01:10:14.485
- I ain't got time for games...
- I don't like set-ups!

01:10:14.716 --> 01:10:16.953
What? This is legit!

01:10:18.652 --> 01:10:22.995
If I was setting you up, wouldn't cops
be here now with their guns?

01:10:23.229 --> 01:10:24.406
Oh, shit!

01:10:24.605 --> 01:10:26.427
Help!

01:10:26.652 --> 01:10:29.140
Get off, you fucker!

01:10:29.788 --> 01:10:33.433
Jesus Christ!
Who authorized this sting?

01:10:33.628 --> 01:10:35.189
You did?

01:10:35.452 --> 01:10:37.143
Well, that's great!

01:10:37.404 --> 01:10:42.194
No, thank you, sergeant!
I think you've done enough!

01:10:51.036 --> 01:10:52.596
Let's get out of here!

01:10:52.828 --> 01:10:56.407
- It's fenced overseas.
- Doesn't Billing get complaints?

01:10:56.604 --> 01:11:00.979
- They can't complain. They're dead.
- Then you have to go to Walsh.

01:11:01.277 --> 01:11:04.276
He'll say I fucked up
my first legitimate job.

01:11:04.476 --> 01:11:05.785
I'll get out myself.

01:11:06.044 --> 01:11:08.794
You need evidence.
I can get that for you.

01:11:09.052 --> 01:11:12.565
- I don't want you involved.
- I am involved!

01:11:17.757 --> 01:11:19.764
John?

01:11:28.476 --> 01:11:30.712
Oh, Johnny.

01:11:32.828 --> 01:11:36.406
- I need card numbers.
- I gave them back to Keith.

01:11:36.636 --> 01:11:39.157
Wait, I got receipts.

01:11:45.052 --> 01:11:48.183
Shit! They changed my access code!

01:11:50.045 --> 01:11:53.209
Seymour! Oh, shit! Come on!

01:11:58.173 --> 01:12:00.791
- Put him in Dilton's office!
- Get off me!

01:12:01.852 --> 01:12:02.997
Check that room!

01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:05.367
That's it! I'm going crazy!

01:12:10.716 --> 01:12:14.098
- I have to get Seymour. Get out!
- Let me help.

01:12:31.964 --> 01:12:33.787
Hey, stupid!

01:12:42.972 --> 01:12:44.947
You fuck!

01:12:59.613 --> 01:13:01.784
Are we having fun?

01:13:03.164 --> 01:13:05.553
Peekaboo, I see you.

01:13:21.468 --> 01:13:23.541
Come on, let's go.

01:13:27.484 --> 01:13:30.419
- But the tape?
- Forget it. We got dead bodies!

01:13:37.628 --> 01:13:39.155
Oh, wow.

01:13:39.452 --> 01:13:42.005
What are you doing here?
Out of doughnuts?

01:13:42.236 --> 01:13:45.585
No, I came for credit!
You okay, Seymour?

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:48.571
- Of course.
- I wasn't talking to you.

01:13:48.764 --> 01:13:52.409
I thought you'd have
your shit together. But you don't.

01:13:58.332 --> 01:14:00.568
Come on! Take us both to hell.

01:14:01.724 --> 01:14:03.349
Shoot him. Shoot him!

01:14:04.572 --> 01:14:07.606
- Come on, test me out.
- Shoot him, Johnny.

01:14:11.388 --> 01:14:13.079
- Close the door.
- Fuck you!

01:14:13.276 --> 01:14:15.186
Close the fucking door!

01:14:18.237 --> 01:14:20.822
- Why are you waiting?
- Stay with her.

01:14:27.228 --> 01:14:28.887
What are you guys doing?

01:14:36.924 --> 01:14:39.029
Son of a bitch!

01:14:42.396 --> 01:14:43.606
You're crazy!

01:14:47.452 --> 01:14:49.688
Johnny, get me out of here.

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:51.862
Come on, Johnny!

01:14:53.532 --> 01:14:55.354
Catch me if you can!

01:14:57.212 --> 01:14:59.383
You ain't seen nothing, bitch!

01:15:00.316 --> 01:15:02.258
Watch the lady!

01:15:03.548 --> 01:15:04.825
You're crazy.

01:15:09.244 --> 01:15:10.357
Move, punk.

01:15:14.908 --> 01:15:16.152
Shit.

01:15:19.132 --> 01:15:20.506
Shit.

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:23.862
Sorry.

01:15:25.756 --> 01:15:27.643
Move it, you piece of shit.

01:15:33.948 --> 01:15:34.963
Shit.

01:15:45.532 --> 01:15:47.288
I gotta go see my brother.

01:15:56.956 --> 01:15:58.745
You again!

01:15:59.004 --> 01:16:00.760
You son of a bitch!

01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:07.794
Damn.

01:16:14.684 --> 01:16:16.026
Don't be sad.

01:16:19.964 --> 01:16:21.425
Come back here!

01:16:26.556 --> 01:16:28.890
Home base, I got a situation here.

01:16:47.324 --> 01:16:50.640
Know something?
I have no use for you anymore.

01:16:51.548 --> 01:16:52.889
Son of a bitch.

01:16:53.468 --> 01:16:55.639
You little shit!

01:17:02.172 --> 01:17:03.350
Shit.

01:17:17.404 --> 01:17:19.227
- Where's my brother?
- Dead.

01:17:19.516 --> 01:17:21.938
- Then you're gonna join him.
- Johnny.

01:17:26.684 --> 01:17:28.986
I'll kill you, you stupid fuck.

01:17:33.627 --> 01:17:36.726
I'm a good driver, don't you think?

01:18:48.124 --> 01:18:50.393
That was close, Johnny.

01:18:52.796 --> 01:18:54.968
Where you going?

01:18:57.468 --> 01:18:59.377
Look at me.

01:19:02.268 --> 01:19:05.399
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:19:17.051 --> 01:19:18.393
Come here.

01:19:30.972 --> 01:19:34.387
The difference between me and you?
You play fair.

01:19:35.388 --> 01:19:37.395
Hold this, Johnny.

01:19:51.708 --> 01:19:56.727
Remember I said if you fucked me,
I'd kill you? You fucked me!

01:20:12.635 --> 01:20:17.370
Remember I told you to kiss my ass?
Well, kiss my ass.

01:20:36.956 --> 01:20:37.404
- Here we are, Mr. Cahn.
- Not so quickly.

01:20:37.404 --> 01:20:40.153
- Here we are, Mr. Cahn.
- Not so quickly.

01:20:40.348 --> 01:20:44.145
Excuse me, nurse. What room
is Johnny Stewart in?

01:20:47.004 --> 01:20:48.946
What room is
John Stewart in?

01:20:49.148 --> 01:20:52.945
332, down the hall.
Now get out of my face!

01:20:53.148 --> 01:20:54.555
Thank you.

01:20:54.748 --> 01:20:57.137
Son of a bitch. Yes?

01:20:59.516 --> 01:21:01.043
Flowers.

01:21:08.796 --> 01:21:11.447
You won't be needing these...

01:21:11.644 --> 01:21:13.138
...Jim.

01:21:13.371 --> 01:21:16.470
- Look out, coming through.
- Emergency!

01:21:17.051 --> 01:21:18.644
What's up?

01:21:20.795 --> 01:21:24.505
- Am I interrupting something?
- No, sixth toe.

01:21:24.795 --> 01:21:28.243
- Got you some flowers, bro.
- How sweet.

01:21:28.508 --> 01:21:31.770
No, he probably took them off
some dead guy.

01:21:32.636 --> 01:21:35.799
Johnny, I came up
with the master plan.

01:21:36.028 --> 01:21:39.989
We sue the Dynasty Club.
We'll get workman's constipation!

01:21:40.251 --> 01:21:42.870
No more scams, all right?

01:21:43.131 --> 01:21:46.001
- You need to settle down.
- With who?

01:21:46.844 --> 01:21:48.021
I know a girl.

01:21:49.372 --> 01:21:50.419
Is she cute?

01:21:51.931 --> 01:21:54.320
- What's my name?
- Is she cute?

01:21:54.555 --> 01:21:56.977
- What's my name?
- Is she cute?

01:21:58.268 --> 01:22:01.563
- Seymour.
- Hey, what's up, Charlotte girl?

01:22:01.756 --> 01:22:04.407
You're looking beautiful, girl.

01:22:04.603 --> 01:22:07.832
- I got you flowers.
- I got something for you too.

01:22:08.091 --> 01:22:09.553
Johnny, I'll get you.

01:22:11.067 --> 01:22:13.206
Now, where were we?

01:22:14.651 --> 01:22:17.237
Mo' money! Mo' money! Mo' money!
