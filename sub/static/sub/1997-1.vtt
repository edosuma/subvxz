WEBVTT

01:37.681 --> 01:39.421
Who are you?

02:32.444 --> 02:33.604
What is this?

02:33.604 --> 02:37.271
Our Majesty, caught him up
in a fishing net. A fishing net.

02:37.271 --> 02:39.360
Sire, he's been telling stories.
Stories that...

02:39.360 --> 02:41.399
We believe he's found a...

02:49.419 --> 02:51.330
Ponce de Leon.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.789
Says he found Ponce de Leon's ship.

02:55.789 --> 02:58.674
- Or sailed on it.
- No, I told you,

02:58.674 --> 03:01.086
Ponce de Leon died 200 years ago.

03:01.086 --> 03:04.756
Ah, but he died searching
for something, didn't he?

03:07.479 --> 03:09.185
The Fountain of Youth.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.059
How soon can you sail?

03:17.406 --> 03:19.488
With the tide.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.794
Over here Lucky heather.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.009
Pirate swords. Pirate swords.

03:42.009 --> 03:45.547
Pirate's execution today.
Watch him swing.

03:45.547 --> 03:47.557
Pirate puppets.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.217
Take that, you.

03:49.217 --> 03:51.182
Hurry, Papa, or we will miss the hanging.

03:51.182 --> 03:55.019
It's not a hanging, dear, it's a trial.
The hanging comes this afternoon.

03:55.019 --> 03:56.808
Pirate hanging today.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.647
Come on. Up you get.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.524
Move along, pirate.

04:05.287 --> 04:08.074
Or should I say, "Captain Pirate"?

04:09.291 --> 04:12.454
Come on. Come on. Up you go.

04:12.454 --> 04:14.458
Quiet. Order.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.329
Quiet.

04:18.175 --> 04:19.915
Now appearing before the court,

04:19.915 --> 04:23.301
the notorious and infamous
pirate, pillager,

04:23.301 --> 04:24.837
and highwayman... Quiet.

04:24.837 --> 04:26.676
...Captain Jack Sparrow.

04:30.937 --> 04:34.429
I told you, the name's Gibbs.
Joshamee Gibbs.

04:34.429 --> 04:36.394
- How many times...
- Hear ye, hear ye.

04:36.394 --> 04:37.853
Presiding over these trials,

04:37.853 --> 04:43.614
all rise and attend,
the Right Honorable Justice Smith.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.158
My dear sir.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.087
Quiet.

05:01.760 --> 05:02.480
Now...

05:05.138 --> 05:07.094
...what do we have here?

05:07.094 --> 05:08.550
Jack?

05:08.550 --> 05:10.181
Shut up.

05:11.061 --> 05:11.971
I don't recognize him.

05:11.971 --> 05:15.308
Not necessary. You were saying?

05:15.308 --> 05:18.098
Jack Sparrow is not my name.

05:18.098 --> 05:20.141
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.

05:20.141 --> 05:22.026
Is that so?

05:22.026 --> 05:25.189
- It says Jack Sparrow here.
- I told them.

05:25.189 --> 05:28.484
I am not Jack Sparrow, who I would
be happy to identify to the court

05:28.484 --> 05:31.529
if it would help my case.
I think that would be a poor defense,

05:31.529 --> 05:34.368
unless you want to be bludgeoned again
like a harp seal.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.663
The prisoner claims of being innocent

05:37.663 --> 05:40.204
to being Jack Sparrow. How do you find?

05:41.091 --> 05:43.082
No trial? But aren't we here
to examine the evidence...

05:43.082 --> 05:45.751
Foreman, your finding. Guilty?

05:45.751 --> 05:47.760
Guilty verdict means he will hang.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.598
Hang him. String him up.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.387
- Guilty?
- That's not fair.

05:56.387 --> 05:57.771
Shut it.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.813
Joshamee Gibbs, the crime of which
you have been found guilty of

06:02.813 --> 06:05.695
is being innocent of being Jack Sparrow.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.231
I hereby commute your sentence,

06:08.231 --> 06:11.026
and order that you be imprisoned
for the remainder

06:11.026 --> 06:14.037
of your miserable, moribund,
mutton-chopped life.

06:14.037 --> 06:16.118
- What?
- Hang him.

06:16.118 --> 06:17.453
- Hang him.
- There.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.953
- Balderdash.
- String him up. Hang him high.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.248
Means shall be arranged
to transport this prisoner

06:25.248 --> 06:27.418
to the Tower of London.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.222
Thanks very much.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.814
Ta.

06:49.659 --> 06:52.241
Come on. Get up there.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.370
Get up.

07:01.087 --> 07:04.705
Hell's teeth.
Now we're both headed for prison.

07:04.705 --> 07:07.545
Not to worry.
I have paid off the driver.

07:07.545 --> 07:11.052
Ten minutes, we will be outside
London Town, horses waiting.

07:11.052 --> 07:12.712
Tonight, we make the coast.

07:12.712 --> 07:15.223
Then it's just a matter
of finding a ship.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.135
- All part of the plan, yes?
- Exactly.

07:19.135 --> 07:21.225
I arrived in London Town
just this morning

07:21.225 --> 07:24.516
to rescue one Joshamee Gibbs
from one appointment with the gallows.

07:24.516 --> 07:26.434
Seeing as how you're still alive,

07:26.434 --> 07:29.320
I'd say it's all been
very successful thus far.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.193
What happened to you, Gibbs?

07:31.193 --> 07:33.905
I thought you were employed elsewhere
or otherwise engaged.

07:33.905 --> 07:37.537
Aye. But I always listened like a thief
for news of the Black Pearl..

07:37.537 --> 07:40.119
Nobody's seen where
she might next make port.

07:40.119 --> 07:42.329
Then, I hear a rumor:

07:42.329 --> 07:45.962
Jack Sparrow's in London
with a ship and looking for a crew.

07:45.962 --> 07:47.838
- Am not.
- But that's what I heard.

07:47.838 --> 07:50.216
Fact is, you're signing up men tonight.

07:50.216 --> 07:51.877
Pub called The Captain's Daughter.

07:51.877 --> 07:55.263
- Am not.
- Well, I thought it a bit odd,

07:55.263 --> 07:59.096
but then, you have never been
the most predictable of sorts.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.261
Tell me something.

08:01.261 --> 08:04.931
There is another Jack Sparrow out there
sullying my good name?

08:04.931 --> 08:07.226
- An impostor.
- Indeed.

08:07.226 --> 08:11.113
But... an impostor with a ship.

08:11.113 --> 08:13.819
And in need of a crew.

08:13.819 --> 08:15.985
Which, as fate would have it, so am I.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.619
What about you, Jack?

08:18.619 --> 08:22.624
Last I heard, you were hell-bent
to find the Fountain of Youth.

08:22.624 --> 08:24.284
Any luck?

08:26.381 --> 08:29.293
Circumstances arose
and forced a compelling insight

08:29.293 --> 08:31.423
regarding discretion and valor.

08:31.423 --> 08:34.677
- Meaning, you gave up.
- I did not.

08:34.677 --> 08:37.635
I am just as bent as ever.
Hellishly so.

08:37.635 --> 08:42.599
I shall taste those waters,
Master Gibbs. Mark my words.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.389
Short trip.

08:55.326 --> 08:58.363
All part of the plan, yes?

09:01.541 --> 09:02.576
No.

10:30.922 --> 10:34.085
You are Jack Sparrow?

10:34.551 --> 10:36.792
There should be a "Captain"
in there somewhere.

10:36.792 --> 10:39.461
I have heard of you.

10:39.461 --> 10:41.675
And you know who I am.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.262
Face is familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

10:45.262 --> 10:49.179
You are in the presence of George
Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-uneburg,

10:49.179 --> 10:52.190
Archtreasurer and Prince-elector
of the Holy Roman Empire,

10:52.190 --> 10:55.727
King of Great Britain and Ireland,
and of you.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.572
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- I am informed

10:59.572 --> 11:04.156
you have come to London
to procure a crew for your ship.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.454
Vicious rumor. Not true.

11:06.454 --> 11:09.707
Then you lied to me when you
told me you were Jack Sparrow.

11:09.707 --> 11:13.086
I am Jack Sparrow,
but I am not here to procure a crew.

11:13.086 --> 11:15.622
That is... someone else.

11:16.843 --> 11:20.335
Someone else named Jack Sparrow.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.258
You have brought me the wrong wastrel.

11:23.258 --> 11:26.675
Find the proper one
and dispose of this impostor.

11:26.675 --> 11:28.889
No, wait, wait, wait. Hang on a minute.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.429
I am Jack Sparrow, the one and only.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.269
And I am in London.

11:33.269 --> 11:35.479
To procure a crew.

11:35.479 --> 11:37.314
To undertake a voyage....

11:37.314 --> 11:38.898
....to the Fountain...
What?

11:38.898 --> 11:43.612
Will someone please remove
these infernal chains?

11:43.612 --> 11:44.901
Come, come.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.781
We know you're in possession of a map.

11:49.781 --> 11:53.076
So confiscate the map,
and to the gallows with him.

11:53.076 --> 11:55.085
Have you a map?

12:00.470 --> 12:02.461
- No.
- Where is it?

12:02.461 --> 12:06.302
The truth? I lost it.

12:06.302 --> 12:10.435
- Quite recently, in fact.
- I have a report.

12:10.435 --> 12:14.189
The Spanish have located
the Fountain of Youth.

12:14.189 --> 12:19.444
I will not have some
melancholy Spanish monarch,

12:19.444 --> 12:24.199
a Catholic, gain eternal life.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.695
You do know the way to the Fountain?

12:28.695 --> 12:30.989
Of course I do.
Look at me.

12:30.989 --> 12:32.998
You could guide an expedition.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.666
With your permission, your heinie,

12:37.666 --> 12:40.206
you will be providing, then, a ship...

12:42.136 --> 12:43.467
...and a crew?

12:43.467 --> 12:46.129
And a captain.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.988
Afternoon, sire.

13:05.535 --> 13:09.369
If I may be so bold,
why is that man not in chains?

13:09.369 --> 13:11.404
He must be manacled at once.

13:11.404 --> 13:15.166
At the center of my palace? Hardly.

13:15.166 --> 13:16.906
"Hector."

13:17.630 --> 13:21.088
How nice to see a fellow pirate
make good of himself.

13:21.088 --> 13:24.376
Pirate? Nay. Privateer.

13:24.376 --> 13:30.094
On a sanctioned mission under the
authority and protection of the Crown.

13:30.094 --> 13:33.726
As may be, but first,

13:33.726 --> 13:36.057
what has become of my beloved Pearl?

13:36.057 --> 13:39.315
I lost the Pearl as I lost my leg.

13:39.315 --> 13:41.726
- Lost the Pearl?
- Aye.

13:41.726 --> 13:45.772
I defended her mightily enough,
but she be sunk nonetheless.

13:52.457 --> 13:55.915
If that ship be sunk properly,
you should be sunk with it.

13:55.915 --> 14:01.330
Captain Barbossa, each second we tarry,
the Spanish outdistance us.

14:01.330 --> 14:04.920
I have every confidence
you will prevail and be rewarded

14:04.920 --> 14:07.380
with the high station you so desire.

14:07.380 --> 14:12.299
- To serve doth suffice, sire.
- You, sir, have stooped.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.768
Jack, our sands be all but run.

14:15.768 --> 14:19.226
Where's the harm
in joining the winning side?

14:19.226 --> 14:23.143
And you do meet
a nicer class of person.

14:23.143 --> 14:25.687
I understand everything.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.406
Except that wig.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.869
He's getting away. Stop him.

14:37.869 --> 14:41.628
- Head him off.
- No. Stop that pirate.

15:03.611 --> 15:04.600
Come down.

15:14.872 --> 15:18.285
- He escaped?
- Leave it to me, sire.

15:23.798 --> 15:27.131
Guards. Guards.

15:49.991 --> 15:52.403
- Arms at ready.
- Aye, sir.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.865
Find him.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.597
Finders keepers.

16:24.597 --> 16:25.981
There.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.794
Is that it?

16:55.181 --> 16:57.467
Halt. Stop that carriage.

16:57.467 --> 16:58.882
Head him off.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.525
Out of the way.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.550
Stop that pirate.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.262
Move out of the way.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.232
Stop that man.

17:51.696 --> 17:52.902
Don't let him get away.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.153
Fire.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.776
He's getting away.
After him. Stop him.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.647
After him.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.418
Filthy pirate.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.676
Hello, Jackie.

19:06.354 --> 19:07.890
Hello, Dad.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.479
I heard you're putting together a crew.

19:18.479 --> 19:21.491
If enough people keep saying it,
it must be true.

19:21.491 --> 19:24.403
I heard where you're headed.
The Fountain.

19:24.403 --> 19:26.036
Have you been there?

19:26.999 --> 19:30.207
Does this face look like
it's been to the Fountain of Youth?

19:31.671 --> 19:34.834
- Depends on the light.
- Son, the Fountain.

19:34.834 --> 19:38.795
There will be items required
for the profane ritual.

19:38.795 --> 19:40.584
Two chalices.

19:41.389 --> 19:44.756
- On the map there was a chalice.
- Two, silver.

19:44.756 --> 19:47.767
From the Ponce de Leon ship.
You will need both.

19:47.767 --> 19:51.521
- For?
- The ritual. Don't be a fool, Jackie.

19:51.521 --> 19:54.728
Find out every detail
before you set sail.

19:54.728 --> 19:56.733
Oh, set sail. Love to.

19:56.733 --> 19:59.111
But for that, I may need a ship.

19:59.111 --> 20:02.523
Those folk, over there,
they have a ship.

20:02.523 --> 20:05.239
They're signing up sailors right now.

20:05.239 --> 20:07.574
My heart is pierced by Cupid

20:07.574 --> 20:09.704
I disdain all glittering gold

20:09.704 --> 20:12.207
And one last thing, Jackie.

20:13.587 --> 20:16.920
The Fountain will test you.
Mark my words.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.376
My heart is pierced by Cupid

20:18.376 --> 20:20.462
I disdain all glittering gold

20:20.462 --> 20:23.343
There is nothing can console me

20:23.343 --> 20:26.096
But my jolly sailor bold

20:39.238 --> 20:41.445
I hear you be recruiting a crew.

20:41.445 --> 20:43.651
Aye. That is,

20:43.651 --> 20:47.569
Jack Sparrow be putting together
a modest venture.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.659
You got some nerve, ain't you?

20:51.659 --> 20:53.324
Turning up here dressed like that?

20:53.324 --> 20:55.458
What are you, some kind of impostor?

20:55.458 --> 20:57.790
Have you any idea who I am, mate?

21:00.176 --> 21:01.586
Oi, muckers.

21:01.586 --> 21:04.343
There's a bloke here what's
forgotten his own name.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.390
Lads, I am sailing with Sparrow.

21:09.390 --> 21:11.300
Who will buy a sailor a drink?

21:13.939 --> 21:15.928
Who's "next"?

21:23.407 --> 21:26.444
Bring us some more of those ones.

21:26.444 --> 21:28.780
Yeah, make it four.

21:37.296 --> 21:41.380
You have stolen me,
and I am here to take meself back.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.165
Stop doing that.

23:48.469 --> 23:51.131
Only one person alive knows that move.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.015
Always wanted to do that.

24:02.149 --> 24:03.730
Hello, Angelica.

24:06.153 --> 24:10.021
Hello, Jack. Are you impressed?

24:10.021 --> 24:13.362
I think I almost killed you
once or twice there.

24:13.362 --> 24:17.574
I am touched at this most
sincerest form of flattery.

24:19.041 --> 24:21.248
But why?

24:21.248 --> 24:24.034
You were the only pirate
I thought I would pass for.

24:24.034 --> 24:25.919
That is not a compliment.

24:28.384 --> 24:32.002
Don't worry, Jack.
I forgave you a long time ago.

24:32.002 --> 24:37.299
- For what? For leaving you?
- Recall that I left you.

24:37.299 --> 24:41.344
A gentleman allows a lady
to maintain her fictions.

24:41.344 --> 24:45.014
Look, Sparrow. As long as
my sailors get their money,

24:45.014 --> 24:49.185
they're willing to put up with
any number of peculiarities.

24:49.185 --> 24:53.026
There is one peculiarity
with which I will not put up with.

24:53.701 --> 24:56.738
I will be impersonated as "Captain."
Nothing less.

24:56.738 --> 24:58.903
Well, for that, you need a ship,

24:58.903 --> 25:01.538
and as it turns out, I have one.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.412
I could use a ship.

25:04.412 --> 25:07.293
I hear tell you have been to the Fountain.

25:07.293 --> 25:09.580
There be a lot of hear-telling
going on these days.

25:09.580 --> 25:14.252
- The Fountain of Youth.
- Dearest Angelica, fret not.

25:14.252 --> 25:17.137
You still have a few usable years left.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.633
Always so charming.

25:20.633 --> 25:21.891
You didn't answer me.

25:21.891 --> 25:24.599
Aye. Regarding the Fountain.
Waste of time, really...

25:24.599 --> 25:28.357
Milady, I see unseamanlike fellows
of an officious-looking nature.

25:28.357 --> 25:31.143
Wretched pirates. Find them. Maggots.

25:35.409 --> 25:36.524
Friends of yours?

25:36.524 --> 25:39.318
I may have unintentionally
slighted some king or other.

25:39.318 --> 25:41.236
Open it.

25:41.236 --> 25:44.031
- Yeah, you haven't changed.
- Implying the need?

25:44.031 --> 25:45.540
Yes.

25:45.540 --> 25:47.372
Open this door,
in the name of His Majesty.

25:47.372 --> 25:50.879
You betrayed me.
You seduced me and you used me.

25:50.879 --> 25:52.756
I was innocent of the ways of men.

25:52.756 --> 25:56.168
You demonstrated a lot of technique
for someone I supposedly corrupted.

25:56.168 --> 25:59.088
Imminent danger. Here, now, milady.

25:59.088 --> 26:00.802
Open it.

26:00.802 --> 26:04.560
I was ready to take my vows. And you...

26:04.560 --> 26:07.346
What were you doing in
a Spanish convent, anyway?

26:07.346 --> 26:10.231
Mistook it for a brothel.
Honest mistake.

26:14.198 --> 26:15.813
- There he is.
- Over there.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.170
We are at a disadvantage.

26:36.170 --> 26:39.712
Speak for yourself.
Unlike some who pretend to be,

26:39.712 --> 26:41.630
but cannot, in fact, hold a candle to,

26:41.630 --> 26:43.219
I am Captain Jack Sparrow.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.009
How can you say I used you?

27:23.009 --> 27:25.344
You know exactly how.

27:25.344 --> 27:28.602
I know, but how can you say it?

27:33.277 --> 27:36.769
- So, what is it?
- What is what?

27:36.769 --> 27:38.437
About the Fountain.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.065
What do you know?

27:44.079 --> 27:45.615
You don't happen to be in possession

27:45.615 --> 27:48.997
of two silver chalices,
circa Ponce de Leon?

27:49.751 --> 27:51.582
- No.
- Thought not.

27:51.582 --> 27:55.337
- Why?
- I hear stories.

27:55.337 --> 27:57.293
Rumors.

27:57.293 --> 27:59.583
You are, of course, aware of the ritual.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.627
Yes, I am.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.723
What is it?
What is required?

28:11.356 --> 28:13.312
A mermaid, Jack.

28:21.325 --> 28:22.690
There's been a mistake.

28:22.690 --> 28:26.360
It's a life sentence, not death. Life.

28:31.835 --> 28:35.123
- Barbossa.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

28:35.123 --> 28:38.255
I trust you can tie a noose.

28:38.255 --> 28:39.790
That's a hard thing,

28:39.790 --> 28:42.926
forcing a man to twist
his own hanging rope.

28:43.805 --> 28:46.592
You must lie in your bed
the way you made it.

28:48.477 --> 28:49.808
What's happened to you?

28:49.808 --> 28:53.345
- Where be Jack Sparrow?
- He escaped.

28:53.345 --> 28:54.933
I am on a tight schedule, Gibbs.

28:54.933 --> 28:57.440
The HMS Providence
sets sail at first light.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.727
If you do not care to watch it
hanging here dead,

28:59.727 --> 29:01.896
with a mouth full of flies...

29:03.575 --> 29:05.190
...speak now.

29:06.954 --> 29:09.411
Take me with you.
Any point of the compass...

29:09.411 --> 29:14.371
Take you where, Gibbs?
The Fountain? Aye?

29:14.371 --> 29:17.536
Is that where Jack be headed?

29:17.536 --> 29:21.707
Have you anything
you can offer me, Gibbs?

29:21.707 --> 29:23.375
Anything at all?

29:25.222 --> 29:28.680
Upon me naked word,
you will not see the dawn.

29:36.733 --> 29:38.439
Hand it over.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.481
- You fool.
- I had just enough time

29:45.481 --> 29:48.116
to study those infernal circles.

29:48.116 --> 29:52.906
Every route, every destination.
All safe... in here.

29:54.418 --> 29:58.411
Welcome back to His Majesty's navy,
Master Gibbs.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.516
Show a leg, sailor.

30:13.516 --> 30:14.893
Aye, sir.

30:16.440 --> 30:17.725
What?

30:17.725 --> 30:21.062
- There's been a horrible mistake.
- Keep moving.

30:22.612 --> 30:25.524
- I am not supposed to be here.
- Many a man's woken up at sea,

30:25.524 --> 30:27.610
no idea what, when, wherefore or why.

30:27.610 --> 30:29.991
No memory of the night afore,
whence he signed up

30:29.991 --> 30:31.652
and drank away all his bonus money.

30:31.652 --> 30:33.786
No, no, no. You don't understand, mate.

30:33.786 --> 30:36.323
I am Captain Jack Sparrow.
The original. The only.

30:36.323 --> 30:39.038
Scrum, and the pleasure's all mine.
Now, keep moving.

30:47.596 --> 30:49.006
Scrum.

30:49.006 --> 30:51.388
Get your elbows in.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.766
Why is there a glass coffin?

30:55.766 --> 30:58.349
Do I look like a man in charge?

30:58.349 --> 31:01.435
- Where am I?
- Excuse me, Captain Sparrow, sir.

31:01.435 --> 31:03.225
I be right honored
to welcome you aboard

31:03.225 --> 31:06.645
our world-renowned vessel of infamy,
Queen Anne's Revenge.

31:10.077 --> 31:11.692
Blackbeard.

31:28.095 --> 31:29.926
Work.

31:33.767 --> 31:37.476
- He's a curious one.
- He's been zombiefied.

31:38.772 --> 31:40.262
Zombiefied.

31:40.262 --> 31:43.898
Blackbeard's doing.
All the officers are the same.

31:43.898 --> 31:45.775
Makes them more compliant.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.028
And perpetually ill-tempered.

31:50.742 --> 31:53.324
- Come on. Scrub.
- Yeah.

32:00.377 --> 32:04.040
Pull. Pull. Pull.

32:08.593 --> 32:11.130
Five days underway, at least.

32:11.130 --> 32:15.092
Aye. You can tell that
by the smell of the sea?

32:15.092 --> 32:16.973
Smell of the crew.

32:20.564 --> 32:23.647
Oi. What did that poor sod do?

32:23.647 --> 32:25.808
And how can I make sure to not?

32:25.808 --> 32:28.272
Him? Churchly fellow.

32:28.272 --> 32:30.438
Always going on about the Lord Almighty.

32:30.438 --> 32:32.321
Bible-thumper on this ship?

32:32.321 --> 32:34.357
A missionary is his story.

32:34.357 --> 32:37.243
What I heard was
he got captured in a raid.

32:37.243 --> 32:40.247
Rest of the ship got killed,
but not him.

32:40.247 --> 32:41.702
First mate wouldn't let it happen

32:41.702 --> 32:44.539
on account of his premier standing
with the Lord.

32:44.539 --> 32:49.082
A first mate sticking her neck out
for some prisoner.

32:49.082 --> 32:50.840
That you don't see.

32:50.840 --> 32:53.673
"Her"? First mate is a "her"?

32:53.673 --> 32:55.053
Back to work.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.606
Steady as she goes.

33:20.874 --> 33:25.208
You are a ruthless,
soulless, cross-grained cur.

33:25.208 --> 33:28.836
- I told you I had a ship.
- No, Blackbeard has a ship,

33:28.836 --> 33:31.794
upon which I am now imprisoned.

33:31.794 --> 33:33.924
We can do this, Jack.

33:33.924 --> 33:38.634
The Fountain of Youth,
like you always wanted.

33:38.634 --> 33:43.893
Blackbeard. Edward Teach.
The pirate all pirates fear.

33:43.893 --> 33:46.180
Resurrector of the dead
in his spare time.

33:46.180 --> 33:49.191
- He will listen to me.
- He listens to no one.

33:49.191 --> 33:52.228
Maybe to his own daughter?

33:54.824 --> 33:57.691
Daughter as in... beget by?

33:58.620 --> 34:02.408
Long-lost. Recently found.

34:02.408 --> 34:06.370
Who loves her dear papa
with all her soul.

34:06.370 --> 34:08.581
- He bought that?
- I sold that.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.840
Then it's the Fountain of Youth for him,

34:17.840 --> 34:20.847
or him and you, not you and me.

34:20.847 --> 34:23.053
No, Jack, that's the best part.

34:23.053 --> 34:25.264
He will be dead.

34:26.606 --> 34:28.972
You will be handling
that part yourself, then?

34:28.972 --> 34:31.357
There is a prophecy.

34:31.357 --> 34:33.688
Maybe you don't believe
in the supernatural.

34:33.688 --> 34:36.320
Oh, no, no.
I have seen a thing or two.

34:38.909 --> 34:42.869
The prophecy is this:

34:42.869 --> 34:46.827
Blackbeard will meet his death
within a fortnight

34:46.827 --> 34:50.415
at the hands of a one-legged man.

34:50.415 --> 34:52.750
That's why he needs the Fountain, Jack.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.849
Master Gibbs, short we are a map.

35:11.849 --> 35:15.064
Perhaps you'd be so kind
as to provide us an heading.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.944
Be a gem and pour me a gulper.

35:20.944 --> 35:24.532
Nay. We be privateers,
not pirates, Master Gibbs.

35:24.532 --> 35:26.788
And in the king's name,
we behave as such.

35:26.788 --> 35:29.745
Aye, Captain.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.956
Be we on the proper course, Gibbs?

35:35.956 --> 35:40.719
Aye, it be proper.
There's your proof.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.510
The Spaniard.

35:50.106 --> 35:54.816
All hands. Battle stations.
Get to windward.

35:54.816 --> 35:58.023
- All hands, windward.
- Harden up two points.

35:58.023 --> 36:01.611
- Two points.
- Cast loose the cannons.

36:05.622 --> 36:09.331
- Gunners, take posts.
- Take position. Gunners ready, sir.

36:09.331 --> 36:13.335
- Out. Thrust.
- Await orders.

36:15.465 --> 36:16.796
Steady.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.757
Guns armed, awaiting orders, sir.

36:25.558 --> 36:29.096
Sir. Orders, sir?

36:35.735 --> 36:38.442
He never so much as turned his head.

36:38.442 --> 36:40.444
The Fountain is the prize.

36:40.444 --> 36:44.199
It appears we be not even worth
the time it'd take to sink us.

36:44.199 --> 36:48.237
And now we have fallen behind.
All hands, make more sail.

36:48.237 --> 36:50.952
All hands, more sail.

36:50.952 --> 36:54.414
Ride hard between wind and tide.

37:04.431 --> 37:08.015
The topic, gentlemen, is mutiny.

37:08.810 --> 37:10.550
Mutiny most foul.

37:10.550 --> 37:14.221
Aye. I signed up to sail
under Jack Sparrow, not some pretender.

37:14.221 --> 37:15.639
And a lady, at that.

37:15.639 --> 37:17.978
And mention was failed to
be made of this uncanny crew.

37:17.978 --> 37:20.485
Make my toes curl, they do.

37:20.485 --> 37:23.692
I got them. All of them.

37:23.692 --> 37:25.778
- Well done.
- Good lad.

37:25.778 --> 37:28.364
On to it, then. Blackbeard.

37:28.364 --> 37:30.950
- What are his habits?
- Stays mostly to his cabin.

37:30.950 --> 37:33.866
That's right, mostly to his cabin.

37:33.866 --> 37:37.206
- Yes, but when he comes out...
- He don't really come out.

37:39.215 --> 37:40.546
He must come out sometime.

37:41.468 --> 37:43.629
Not really, no.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.174
Any of you sail with him before?

37:47.174 --> 37:48.758
- No, no.
- I have never.

37:48.758 --> 37:49.922
Definitely not.

37:49.922 --> 37:53.935
- Any of you seen him before?
- Not really, no.

37:55.565 --> 37:57.726
Stays to his cabin,
no one sailed with him,

37:57.726 --> 37:59.892
no one's seen him...

37:59.892 --> 38:03.061
Good news, gentlemen.
This is not Blackbeard's ship.

38:03.061 --> 38:05.025
This is not the Queen Anne's Revenge.

38:05.025 --> 38:07.191
No, this be the Queen Anne's Revenge,
right enough.

38:07.191 --> 38:08.778
How do you know?

38:08.778 --> 38:12.195
I have seen the name,
on the back of the ship.

38:15.460 --> 38:20.420
Gentlemen, sirs, fellow conscriptees...

38:22.175 --> 38:24.257
...you have been monstrously deceived.

38:24.257 --> 38:28.545
- We are decepted, then?
- Yes.

38:28.545 --> 38:31.590
You have nay been informed
of a destination.

38:31.590 --> 38:33.884
Death lies before us

38:33.884 --> 38:38.852
as we sail for the Fountain of Youth.

38:40.693 --> 38:42.354
It would be a sorry plight, mates.

38:42.354 --> 38:46.613
- Death, for certain.
- The garden of darkened souls.

38:46.613 --> 38:50.116
- Untimely our ends will be.
- Unless...

38:50.116 --> 38:52.777
...we take the ship.

38:54.123 --> 38:57.615
We take the ship, then. Now.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.371
Go on, then.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.791
- Help me, shipmates.
- Give it to them.

39:06.791 --> 39:09.177
- Wake up. It's ours.
- Come on.

39:09.177 --> 39:11.962
Get up. Off your backside.

39:12.559 --> 39:14.891
- Get off your fannies.
- Take it to them, lads.

39:14.891 --> 39:16.847
Help me. Fight.

39:30.451 --> 39:31.816
Jack.

39:33.496 --> 39:38.081
If this is a dream,
you can keep the sword and boots on.

39:40.253 --> 39:42.744
- If it's not...
- It's a dream.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.421
No, it's not.

39:50.763 --> 39:53.300
I thought I should give you
fair warning, we're taking the ship.

39:54.350 --> 39:55.840
Nothing personal.

39:56.936 --> 39:58.801
Think you might be better off
if you just...

40:00.481 --> 40:01.766
...stay out of it.

40:25.381 --> 40:26.666
Boggit.

40:48.196 --> 40:49.561
Wretch.

41:19.227 --> 41:21.183
You're either with us or against us.

41:21.183 --> 41:23.515
I am not with you,
neither am I against you.

41:23.515 --> 41:25.021
Can he do that?

41:25.021 --> 41:28.183
He's religious.
I believe it's required.

41:33.533 --> 41:36.821
Fight to the bitter end,
you cack-handed deck apes.

41:48.673 --> 41:51.039
Take him, men.
Tie him down tight.

42:05.815 --> 42:07.521
The ship is ours.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.594
Gentlemen.

42:46.064 --> 42:49.522
I be placed in a bewilderment.

42:49.522 --> 42:54.311
There I were, resting,

42:54.311 --> 42:59.108
and upon a sudden,
I hear an ungodly row on deck.

43:02.205 --> 43:04.116
Sailors abandon their posts

43:04.116 --> 43:06.781
without orders, without leave.

43:07.919 --> 43:11.127
Men before the mast,

43:11.127 --> 43:13.663
taking the ship for themselves.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.712
What be that, First Mate?

43:17.712 --> 43:20.720
- Mutiny, Captain.
- Again?

43:20.720 --> 43:23.848
- Mutiny.
- Aye.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.096
Mutiny.

43:28.648 --> 43:32.061
And what fate befalls mutineers?

43:32.061 --> 43:35.727
Now, we know the answer to that,
do we not?

43:35.727 --> 43:39.443
Mutineers hang.

44:29.292 --> 44:30.998
Captain, I wish to report a mutiny.

44:32.545 --> 44:34.126
I can name fingers and point names.

44:34.126 --> 44:35.753
No need, Mr. Sparrow.

44:35.753 --> 44:39.131
They are sheep. You, their shepherd.

44:44.056 --> 44:46.718
Have I mentioned, sir,
what a lovely daughter you have?

44:47.393 --> 44:49.805
A fitting last sight for a doomed soul.

44:49.805 --> 44:52.345
Remember, Father.
We need him.

44:52.345 --> 44:53.979
If I don't kill a man
every now and then,

44:53.979 --> 44:56.516
they forget who I am. Coward.

44:58.196 --> 45:00.312
They do not forget.

45:00.312 --> 45:02.855
Your crew sees you
for the miscreant you are.

45:02.855 --> 45:05.320
A coward, no matter how many you slay.

45:05.320 --> 45:07.860
Twice in one day,
I find myself in a bewilderment.

45:07.860 --> 45:10.155
You are not bewildered, you are afraid.

45:10.875 --> 45:13.161
You dare not walk the path of
righteousness, the way of the light.

45:13.161 --> 45:17.545
No, sir. The truth is
it be much simpler than all that.

45:17.545 --> 45:20.582
- I am a bad man.
- That, too.

45:20.582 --> 45:22.716
I might have to kill you too, catechist.

45:22.716 --> 45:25.469
- No.
- All Latin blood like her mother.

45:25.469 --> 45:27.676
Father, I beg you.

45:27.676 --> 45:31.559
There I be again,
forgetting why the missionary is here.

45:31.559 --> 45:36.098
My daughter fears for my soul,
or what's left of it.

45:37.151 --> 45:40.769
You truly wish to save me, my child?

45:40.769 --> 45:42.858
Every soul can be saved.

45:43.950 --> 45:45.781
Be that true, young cleric?

45:45.781 --> 45:49.615
Yes. Though you I see
as a bit of a long shot.

45:50.665 --> 45:54.578
Still, I pray for every unfortunate soul
on this hell-bound vessel.

45:57.171 --> 45:59.787
You disarm me with your faith.

46:01.217 --> 46:02.627
Eight bells.

46:02.627 --> 46:05.760
Which of you unfortunate souls
stood watch?

46:05.760 --> 46:10.890
- I did. I stood watch.
- Gunner.

46:16.274 --> 46:17.639
You?

46:18.359 --> 46:19.940
Aye.

46:20.528 --> 46:22.268
Aye.

46:22.268 --> 46:24.402
The cook.

46:24.402 --> 46:27.406
Perfect. Lower the longboat.

46:32.707 --> 46:34.663
Bring her about.

46:46.262 --> 46:49.254
- Why do you do this?
- Mutiny. Our laws be clear.

46:49.254 --> 46:51.673
Our laws allow the Captain
to show leniency.

46:51.673 --> 46:54.433
I have given this man
a chance to determine his fate,

46:54.433 --> 46:56.264
a gift not afforded to all.

47:05.406 --> 47:06.816
Oh, you now.

47:08.159 --> 47:10.741
Chance to show the worth
of your prayers.

47:10.741 --> 47:14.950
Pray he be delivered from... evil?

47:23.299 --> 47:24.630
Course made.

47:24.630 --> 47:26.631
Stop. Give that man a chance.
Give yourself a...

47:52.370 --> 47:54.952
You know when I feel closest
to our Maker?

47:54.952 --> 47:56.953
When I see suffering, pain and anguish.

47:56.953 --> 47:59.615
That's when the true design
of this world is revealed.

47:59.615 --> 48:03.457
And I see it revealed when in times
of hardship and tragedy,

48:03.457 --> 48:05.872
kindness and compassion
are shown to those in need.

48:05.872 --> 48:08.416
Perhaps you should pray
for him to be unharmed, yes?

48:08.416 --> 48:10.755
- Please, there's still hope...
- Again.

48:23.526 --> 48:26.063
I actually have no interest
in the Fountain whatsoever,

48:26.063 --> 48:28.068
so, if your heart is set,

48:28.068 --> 48:30.400
you may drop me off
anywhere you like.

48:30.400 --> 48:32.314
That will be all, Quartermaster.

48:35.371 --> 48:38.829
Your words surround you like fog
and make you hard to see.

48:38.829 --> 48:42.787
And what of you,
the mighty Blackbeard?

48:42.787 --> 48:45.704
Beheaded they say.
Still, your body swam

48:45.704 --> 48:49.294
three times around your ship,
then climbed back onboard.

48:49.294 --> 48:52.050
And here you are, running scared.

48:52.721 --> 48:56.088
- Scared.
- To the Fountain.

48:56.088 --> 48:59.259
The Quartermaster
sees things before they happen.

48:59.259 --> 49:03.897
He has foreseen my death,
and so the fates have spoken.

49:03.897 --> 49:06.398
The threads of destiny woven.

49:06.398 --> 49:09.481
You have a ridiculously
high regard for fate, mate.

49:09.481 --> 49:11.236
- And you?
- Me?

49:11.236 --> 49:15.650
I am skeptical of predicting
any future... which includes me.

49:15.650 --> 49:21.573
It'd be foolish to battle fate,
but I'd be tempted to cheat it.

49:21.573 --> 49:24.583
I will reach the Fountain.
You will lead me.

49:27.089 --> 49:31.048
That knife will serve you no better
than the mutiny you devised.

49:31.048 --> 49:32.958
Mutiny served me well.

49:32.958 --> 49:35.048
It gained me an audience with you.

49:37.099 --> 49:38.259
Aye.

49:39.727 --> 49:41.467
To warn you.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.016
Regarding your first mate,

49:44.016 --> 49:47.057
who pretends to be persons she is not.

49:47.693 --> 49:48.682
Do tell.

49:51.280 --> 49:53.066
She is not your daughter.

49:56.368 --> 49:59.405
You dare to speak
thusly of my flesh and blood?

49:59.405 --> 50:04.074
Sir, the woman is consummate
in the art of deception.

50:04.074 --> 50:08.665
I know. As I mostly unwittingly
set her on her wicked path.

50:08.665 --> 50:10.750
Though I cannot claim credit

50:10.750 --> 50:13.837
for her existing abundance
of natural talent.

50:15.888 --> 50:18.345
Angelica.
My beloved daughter,

50:18.345 --> 50:21.098
the one true good thing
I have done in this life,

50:21.098 --> 50:23.884
and you claim to be the one
who corrupted her?

50:23.884 --> 50:28.056
Sir, what she is is pure evil.

50:28.056 --> 50:30.600
More to be feared than a wild beast.

50:30.600 --> 50:34.566
Hungry wild beast with gnashing teeth.

50:34.566 --> 50:36.731
Vengeful, hungry from hell beast...

50:36.731 --> 50:39.025
- Father?
- Sweetness.

50:40.996 --> 50:42.532
No need to hurt him, Father.

50:42.532 --> 50:45.914
He will help us. Won't you, Jack?

50:45.914 --> 50:49.794
You see? Even now,
she attends to your welfare,

50:49.794 --> 50:53.502
giving lie to the claims
you make of her.

51:01.100 --> 51:05.560
You will lead us to the Fountain. Yes?

51:06.397 --> 51:08.058
Put another way.

51:08.899 --> 51:12.266
If I do not make it
to the Fountain in time...

51:13.946 --> 51:16.904
...neither will you.

51:19.076 --> 51:23.194
I will have a wee look-see at those
charts straight away then, shall I?

51:26.959 --> 51:28.199
Sir.

51:31.088 --> 51:33.420
- Aye?
- Captain, sir,

51:33.420 --> 51:35.957
I am unhappy to report rumors, sir,

51:35.957 --> 51:38.296
among the crew,
as to our destination.

51:39.513 --> 51:41.469
Shut your trap and make way.

51:45.519 --> 51:49.103
- That's the way of it, then.
- No disrespect, sir.

51:49.940 --> 51:52.727
What do the men fear?
Say it. Speak the words.

51:53.527 --> 51:54.812
Whitecap Bay.

51:54.812 --> 51:58.070
Aye, Whitecap Bay.

51:58.070 --> 52:02.279
And every worthless seaman
fears the name, and rightly so,

52:02.279 --> 52:04.785
though few know why or dare to ask.

52:04.785 --> 52:06.570
Be the stories true?

52:06.570 --> 52:08.535
Say what robs you of
your staunch heart, Gibbs,

52:08.535 --> 52:11.826
or forever leave it
to the wider fields of fancy.

52:14.548 --> 52:16.129
Mermaids, Captain.

52:16.129 --> 52:18.040
Aye. Mermaids.

52:18.040 --> 52:22.336
Sea ghouls, devil fish,
dreadful in hunger for flesh of man.

52:22.336 --> 52:26.052
Mermaid waters, that be our path.

52:26.052 --> 52:27.762
Cling to your soul, Gibbs,

52:27.762 --> 52:31.554
as mermaids be given
to take the rest...

52:31.554 --> 52:33.097
...to the bone.

52:34.693 --> 52:37.810
Steady. Steady, men.
Find your courage,

52:37.810 --> 52:39.853
or be ready to purpose your fear.

52:39.853 --> 52:42.398
Save yourselves.

52:44.995 --> 52:47.828
- Man overboard.
- Nay. A deserter.

52:47.828 --> 52:49.738
- Come about.
- Nay.

52:51.043 --> 52:54.831
Gentlemen, I shall not ask
any more of any man than what

52:54.831 --> 52:59.465
that man can deliver, but I do ask this:
Are we not king's men?

52:59.465 --> 53:01.045
Aye.

53:01.045 --> 53:03.962
- On the king's mission?
- Aye.

53:03.962 --> 53:08.348
I did not note any fear in the eyes
of the Spanish as they passed us by.

53:08.348 --> 53:11.226
- Are we not king's men?
- Aye.

53:11.226 --> 53:14.309
Aye. Hands all off, and bear away.

53:14.309 --> 53:17.395
Stave on ahead to Whitecap Bay.

53:19.071 --> 53:21.403
Bear on, Whitecap Bay.

53:35.421 --> 53:36.877
Come.

53:36.877 --> 53:38.332
Little drink?

53:38.332 --> 53:41.715
Wine, music, candlelight.

53:41.715 --> 53:44.092
I think we have traveled down
this road before, Jack.

53:44.092 --> 53:46.049
Yes, we have.

53:47.057 --> 53:48.422
I remember it well.

53:50.310 --> 53:55.100
Winding, twisting and
turning, gyrating, writhing.

53:55.100 --> 53:57.560
Incessant writhing.

53:57.560 --> 53:59.566
Do you recall Saint Dominique?

54:00.988 --> 54:02.569
La Martinique.

54:02.569 --> 54:04.401
I tried to kill you in Saint Dominique.

54:04.401 --> 54:06.315
Either or.

54:07.161 --> 54:09.152
Hardly appropriate for a first mate.

54:09.152 --> 54:12.742
Was I the first? I have often wondered.

54:12.742 --> 54:17.125
You can be so charming
when you want something, Jack.

54:17.125 --> 54:19.753
The trick is finding out what.

54:20.883 --> 54:22.965
The truth, then, is it?

54:23.719 --> 54:26.176
Blackbeard has served his purpose.

54:26.176 --> 54:28.632
You and I can go to
the Fountain together,

54:28.632 --> 54:31.844
where we shall bathe one another
in equal shares of fame

54:31.844 --> 54:34.010
and other assorted debaucheries.

54:34.010 --> 54:37.146
And I will tell you
the ritual of the Fountain.

54:37.146 --> 54:40.103
Yes. The profane ritual.

54:42.863 --> 54:45.024
Can I trust you, Jack?

54:45.024 --> 54:49.568
- I need you on my side.
- Oh, my dearest Angelica.

54:49.568 --> 54:53.158
You and I are as
thick as thieves, love.

54:53.158 --> 54:55.539
Tell me the rules.

54:57.711 --> 55:01.329
Water from the Fountain of Youth.

55:03.217 --> 55:06.584
The shimmering tear of a mermaid.

55:06.584 --> 55:10.050
The silver chalices of Ponce de Leon.

55:12.017 --> 55:13.723
With these items...

55:13.723 --> 55:15.976
- Yes?
- With these items,

55:15.976 --> 55:19.513
you may take all the years
of life from another, Jack.

55:21.819 --> 55:23.605
You know what that means.

55:23.605 --> 55:26.646
We cannot go alone, you and I.

55:26.646 --> 55:29.065
The ritual requires a victim.

55:30.828 --> 55:34.662
- That is unfortunate.
- Yes, it is.

55:35.707 --> 55:38.540
I find my desire for the Fountain
greatly lessened.

55:39.962 --> 55:42.578
But there is something onboard
you do want.

55:48.387 --> 55:49.718
What about Blackbeard?

55:49.718 --> 55:53.472
He's in the chart room.
We will have to be quick.

56:02.568 --> 56:05.150
He keeps each ship as a prize.

56:06.947 --> 56:11.361
You help me,
and I promise you your pick.

56:11.361 --> 56:14.902
Though I think I know the one
you will choose.

56:20.836 --> 56:23.293
The Black Pearl in a bottle?

56:23.293 --> 56:25.169
Why is the Black Pearl in a bottle?

56:30.971 --> 56:33.804
He's even more annoying in miniature.

56:33.804 --> 56:37.967
- Do we have a deal, Jack?
- Angelica, I know you.

56:37.967 --> 56:40.978
You are not going to steal the life
of some innocent man.

56:41.565 --> 56:43.851
What about the one-legged man?

56:46.111 --> 56:47.726
I need years, Jack.

56:49.573 --> 56:52.986
Not for me. For my father.

56:55.621 --> 56:57.907
I am truly the daughter of Blackbeard.

56:58.957 --> 57:01.118
You have fallen for your own con, love.

57:01.118 --> 57:03.534
No, he is my father.

57:03.534 --> 57:05.373
The lies I told you were not lies.

57:07.215 --> 57:10.048
You lied to me by telling me the truth?

57:10.048 --> 57:12.209
- Yes.
- That's very good.

57:12.209 --> 57:14.799
- May I use that?
- I am sure you will, anyway.

57:14.799 --> 57:17.305
Of course I will.

57:17.305 --> 57:20.138
So, will you not give up this quest?

57:20.771 --> 57:23.888
I want a father, Jack.
I haven't had one.

57:25.150 --> 57:28.392
Angelica, your father, Blackbeard...

57:29.988 --> 57:31.319
...he is evil,

57:31.319 --> 57:33.651
and he will kill you given the chance.

57:33.651 --> 57:36.908
- He cannot be saved.
- And who are you to set

57:36.908 --> 57:39.240
the limits on redemption?

57:39.240 --> 57:42.702
You stole years of my life, Jack.
You owe me.

57:42.702 --> 57:45.913
And you are en route
to getting yourself killed,

57:45.913 --> 57:48.374
and I am not inclined
to stand by and watch.

57:48.374 --> 57:52.257
Whitecap Bay.

57:57.391 --> 58:00.758
All hands on deck.
Set to the longboats.

58:04.856 --> 58:05.845
Lay them out flat.

58:06.566 --> 58:11.310
No tangles. Make them look
pretty for our dainty guests.

58:11.310 --> 58:15.276
We're going to need light.
A lot of light.

58:17.077 --> 58:18.066
Come.

58:39.891 --> 58:45.102
Smell that? Whale oil.
Stuff burns like a miracle from God.

58:45.102 --> 58:48.981
- Can you make it work?
- Made by the English.

58:48.981 --> 58:50.231
Let's not get our hopes up.

59:01.288 --> 59:03.199
The old moon in
the arms of the new one.

59:03.199 --> 59:04.579
First of the summer.

59:05.500 --> 59:08.708
Perfect for hunting a mermaid's tear.

59:21.016 --> 59:24.884
We're doomed.
They be drawn to man-made light.

59:24.884 --> 59:27.724
- Sharks?
- Worse than sharks, boy.

59:27.724 --> 59:30.389
There will be mermaids upon us
within the hour,

59:30.389 --> 59:34.025
you mark my words.
And we're the bait.

59:38.700 --> 59:42.318
I heard it said a kiss from a mermaid
protects a sailor from drowning.

59:42.318 --> 59:46.330
Don't be a fool.
Mermaids are all female, son,

59:46.330 --> 59:49.242
and lovely as a dream of heaven.

59:49.242 --> 59:53.662
But when it comes time
to churn butter, so to speak,

59:53.662 --> 59:55.796
they snatch a sailor out of a boat

59:55.796 --> 59:58.959
or off the deck of a ship,
have their way,

59:58.959 --> 01:00:04.052
and then the sailors are pulled
to bottom and drowned and eaten.

01:00:04.518 --> 01:00:07.931
Or, sometimes, the other way around.

01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:11.851
- Sing.
- What?

01:00:13.235 --> 01:00:15.351
They like to hear singing.

01:00:19.741 --> 01:00:23.279
My name is Maria

01:00:23.279 --> 01:00:26.570
A merchant's daughter fair

01:00:26.570 --> 01:00:30.332
- Louder.
- And I have left my parents

01:00:30.332 --> 01:00:33.665
And 3,000 pounds a year

01:00:33.665 --> 01:00:36.831
My heart is pierced by Cupid

01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:40.421
I disdain all glittering gold

01:00:40.421 --> 01:00:44.053
There is nothing can console me

01:00:44.053 --> 01:00:47.091
But my jolly sailor bold

01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:52.813
My heart is pierced by Cupid

01:00:52.813 --> 01:00:56.646
I disdain all glittering gold

01:00:56.646 --> 01:00:59.527
There is nothing can console me

01:00:59.527 --> 01:01:04.158
But my jolly sailor bold

01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:23.585
Lord save me.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:30.308
Man, look. Look there.

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:32.268
You will scare her off.

01:01:32.268 --> 01:01:33.929
Aye, and good riddance.

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:40.602
Can you talk?

01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:44.814
Yes.

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:53.831
You're beautiful.

01:01:54.669 --> 01:01:58.412
- Are you the one who sings?
- Aye.

01:02:01.343 --> 01:02:03.755
Are you my jolly sailor bold?

01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:08.217
- Aye, that I be.
- Scrum, comport yourself.

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.557
Boys. There ain't much been given to me

01:02:11.557 --> 01:02:14.094
in my brief, miserable life,
there's the truth in it.

01:02:14.094 --> 01:02:15.978
But, by God, I will have it said

01:02:15.978 --> 01:02:19.516
that Scrum had himself a kiss
from a proper mermaid.

01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:24.404
My heart is pierced by Cupid

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:28.067
I disdain all glittering gold

01:02:28.067 --> 01:02:31.612
There is nothing can console me

01:02:31.612 --> 01:02:35.874
But my jolly sailor bold

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:40.871
Come all ye pretty fair maids

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:45.254
Whoever you may be

01:02:45.254 --> 01:02:48.966
Who love a jolly sailor bold

01:02:48.966 --> 01:02:53.850
That ploughs the raging sea

01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:58.104
My heart is pierced by Cupid

01:02:58.104 --> 01:03:02.439
I disdain all glittering gold

01:03:02.439 --> 01:03:06.776
There is nothing can console me

01:03:06.776 --> 01:03:11.284
But my jolly sailor bold

01:03:11.284 --> 01:03:16.574
My heart is pierced by Cupid

01:03:16.574 --> 01:03:19.959
I disdain all glittering gold

01:03:19.959 --> 01:03:24.169
There is nothing can console me

01:03:24.169 --> 01:03:28.130
But my jolly sailor bold

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:07.291
Out upon it. It has begun.

01:04:49.177 --> 01:04:51.042
Light them up.

01:04:51.042 --> 01:04:55.760
Muster your courage.
Drive them to shore.

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:09.649
Nets into the water. Quickly.

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:02.538
Retreat, all, to land.
For your lives.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.285
Retreat, I say.

01:06:07.285 --> 01:06:09.455
Cowards. Back in the water.

01:06:09.455 --> 01:06:13.796
There be no refuge on land.
On my word.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.456
Come on.

01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:25.218
We got one.

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:30.853
I am in love.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.020
Check the wounded.

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:37.935
See if you can find
one mermaid still alive.

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:18.393
Come, give a hand.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:21.647
Well done, sailor.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.274
Did everyone see that?

01:09:24.274 --> 01:09:26.443
Because I will not be doing it again.

01:09:26.443 --> 01:09:31.285
Back to the ship.
We head for a protected cove. Now.

01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:51.054
- Lord. Is that...?
- Mermaid.

01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:54.721
- Give up this madness now.
- I cannot.

01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:56.639
Ever walk on the beach,

01:09:56.639 --> 01:09:59.059
Look back and see your footsteps
in the sand?

01:09:59.059 --> 01:10:03.196
It's like that,
except the footsteps lie before me.

01:10:03.196 --> 01:10:07.154
- Footstep, actually.
- Whitecap Bay, sir.

01:10:07.154 --> 01:10:08.909
We must hasten.

01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:20.580
We travel by foot.
Gibbs, I require a heading.

01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:23.875
- But, sir, the men.
- They be dead already.

01:10:23.875 --> 01:10:27.136
- They don't sound dead.
- Oh, is that so?

01:10:27.136 --> 01:10:31.595
Well, I hear nothing
but seagulls nesting.

01:10:31.595 --> 01:10:33.805
What is it that you hear, Mr. Groves?

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:40.270
Seagulls... nesting.

01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:43.482
- Nothing more.
- Heading, Gibbs?

01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:53.701
My God.

01:10:53.701 --> 01:10:55.866
Your head or my heading.

01:10:55.866 --> 01:10:58.904
I will have me one or t'other,
I don't care which.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:05.667
All hands, forward.

01:11:21.152 --> 01:11:25.612
- It's to you now, Sparrow.
- Was that really necessary?

01:11:25.612 --> 01:11:28.398
Best you not know the exact
whereabouts of my ship.

01:11:28.398 --> 01:11:33.240
- I be a cautious man.
- So be I.

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.120
What I want first...

01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:40.747
...is Ponce De Leon's ship.

01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:19.661
Why is it we have got to bring her along?

01:12:19.661 --> 01:12:23.044
Because tears don't keep.
We need them fresh.

01:12:23.044 --> 01:12:25.921
What is the ritual again?

01:12:25.921 --> 01:12:28.504
Water from the Fountain
and a mermaid's tear?

01:12:28.504 --> 01:12:30.168
And two silver chalices.

01:12:30.168 --> 01:12:32.962
One cup with a tear, one without.

01:12:34.267 --> 01:12:36.633
So, one with a tear and water in both?

01:12:36.633 --> 01:12:38.301
Quite complicated, is it not?

01:12:38.301 --> 01:12:41.516
Both get water. One gets a tear.

01:12:41.516 --> 01:12:44.307
The person who drinks
the water with the tear

01:12:44.307 --> 01:12:46.942
gets all the years of life
from the other.

01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:50.191
How many years?

01:12:51.659 --> 01:12:54.617
All the years
that they have lived,

01:12:54.617 --> 01:12:58.279
and they could have lived,
if fate had been kinder.

01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:08.873
Clergyman.

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:13.799
On the off chance that this
does not go well for me,

01:13:13.799 --> 01:13:15.509
I would like it noted here and now

01:13:15.509 --> 01:13:18.891
that I am fully prepared
to believe in whatever I must,

01:13:18.891 --> 01:13:20.801
so that I may be
welcomed into that place

01:13:20.801 --> 01:13:23.346
where all the goody-goodies
get to go. Savvy?

01:13:23.346 --> 01:13:27.142
We have a word for that, Jack.
You can convert.

01:13:27.142 --> 01:13:29.777
I was thinking more
of an as-needed basis.

01:13:33.784 --> 01:13:35.024
Quartermaster.

01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:37.367
- Aye?
- She cannot breathe.

01:13:37.367 --> 01:13:40.575
- She has water.
- She needs air.

01:13:44.545 --> 01:13:46.456
- Open this.
- She will escape.

01:13:46.456 --> 01:13:50.340
- You're killing her.
- I support the missionary's position.

01:13:58.893 --> 01:13:59.928
See?

01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:06.685
Onward.

01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:34.338
Just as I thought. Not this way.

01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:37.840
This is the way, isn't it?

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.802
Of course it is, but we
should go around to the east.

01:14:40.802 --> 01:14:42.808
That would take us out of
the path of the chalices.

01:14:42.808 --> 01:14:44.719
- Well, then we will circle back.
- There is no time.

01:14:44.719 --> 01:14:46.512
You're the one who insisted
on bringing the bloody mermaid.

01:14:46.512 --> 01:14:48.647
- Well, the mutiny didn't help.
- You walk like a girl.

01:14:48.647 --> 01:14:50.900
- You would know.
- Someone must go.

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:53.478
You mean split up?

01:14:53.478 --> 01:14:56.523
You mean jump?
This I cannot wait to see.

01:14:56.523 --> 01:15:00.614
Sparrow will go.
Find the ship, retrieve the chalices.

01:15:00.614 --> 01:15:02.779
Sparrow? What makes you
think he will come back?

01:15:02.779 --> 01:15:06.165
Yes, what makes you think
he will come back?

01:15:06.165 --> 01:15:08.792
We cannot trust him, Father.
I will go.

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:11.378
She will go.

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:16.759
How much farther to the Fountain?

01:15:16.759 --> 01:15:18.590
I am running out of time.

01:15:20.599 --> 01:15:22.715
About a day's march north,
following that river,

01:15:22.715 --> 01:15:26.351
you will get to a series of pools.
Then you're close.

01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:30.098
You will go.

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:35.315
I was sure it would come to this.

01:15:48.919 --> 01:15:53.037
You know that feeling you get sometimes
when you're standing in a high place?

01:15:53.037 --> 01:15:55.126
Sudden urge to jump?

01:15:57.053 --> 01:15:58.589
I don't have it.

01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:01.504
I need those chalices.

01:16:01.504 --> 01:16:04.139
Shoot. Save me the bother of the fall.

01:16:04.139 --> 01:16:07.347
You will go. You will return...

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:10.645
...or I will kill her.

01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:14.976
You won't kill your own daughter.

01:16:14.976 --> 01:16:17.896
Quartermaster, get me six more pistols,

01:16:17.896 --> 01:16:19.655
remove the shot from all but two,

01:16:19.655 --> 01:16:22.282
but do not tell me which two.

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:27.162
You get to choose, Mr. Sparrow.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.120
No.

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:34.369
No.

01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:40.297
- Yes.
- You're sure?

01:16:40.297 --> 01:16:41.881
Of course I am.

01:16:50.147 --> 01:16:51.182
Again.

01:16:52.733 --> 01:16:55.224
Please, they're not even loaded.

01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:01.447
Again.

01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:04.191
If you're so keen on killing her,

01:17:04.191 --> 01:17:06.736
why don't you just let her jump?
What?

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.997
If you jump and die,

01:17:09.997 --> 01:17:13.785
then she will have her chance.

01:17:13.785 --> 01:17:15.419
Again.

01:17:18.676 --> 01:17:20.541
Oi...

01:17:20.541 --> 01:17:24.553
...if I jump, will I survive?

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:28.223
The doll.

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:49.287
- Yes, now you will survive.
- This is nonsense. I am going.

01:18:08.058 --> 01:18:11.266
Wet. Wet again.

01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:16.473
We go on.
Due north to the Fountain.

01:18:17.318 --> 01:18:18.649
Well played, Father.

01:18:20.446 --> 01:18:22.732
You knew which guns were loaded, right?

01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:27.448
Of course, my love.

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:39.836
Be nice to have a map about now.

01:18:39.836 --> 01:18:41.622
Or a ship.

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:46.093
Stop. Hold very still.

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:51.048
Ye dare not let it touch your skin.

01:18:59.818 --> 01:19:03.026
What? What be wrong with
an older man having a hobby?

01:19:03.026 --> 01:19:05.688
What are you stopping for, eh?
Push on.

01:19:05.688 --> 01:19:08.027
- Push on.
- You can sleep when you're dead.

01:19:08.027 --> 01:19:09.362
Push on.

01:19:10.996 --> 01:19:14.329
Fortune continues to favor us.

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:44.318
The Santiago.

01:19:44.318 --> 01:19:47.195
Famously captained by Ponce de Leon.

01:19:49.994 --> 01:19:51.404
There's no one there.

01:19:51.404 --> 01:19:52.567
Right, then.

01:20:27.281 --> 01:20:28.646
We must not stop.

01:20:36.707 --> 01:20:38.447
You will walk.

01:20:57.644 --> 01:20:59.760
I cannot.

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:01.678
Walk or die.

01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:09.361
Put your arms around me.

01:21:09.361 --> 01:21:12.898
- I do not ask for help.
- But you need it.

01:21:29.843 --> 01:21:34.132
- We're in a hurry, yes?
- Do not fall behind.

01:21:53.492 --> 01:21:55.198
Hold here till I say.

01:22:08.298 --> 01:22:10.129
Such beauty.

01:22:10.129 --> 01:22:13.588
Surely you're one of
God's own creations,

01:22:13.588 --> 01:22:16.674
and not a descendant
of those dark creatures

01:22:16.674 --> 01:22:19.090
who found no refuge on the Ark.

01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:24.011
Such beauty...

01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:26.896
...and yet deadly.

01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:31.359
- Deadly? No.
- You attacked me.

01:22:31.359 --> 01:22:36.445
No. You are different.

01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:38.571
Different?

01:22:38.571 --> 01:22:42.738
Are you not? You protect.

01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:47.205
Did you...?

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:51.623
You pushed me down out of the way.

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:57.261
- You see the Fountain?
- No, but we are close.

01:22:57.848 --> 01:22:59.679
Bring the creature.
Cover its head.

01:22:59.679 --> 01:23:01.806
She has a name.

01:23:06.356 --> 01:23:07.846
Pray tell.

01:23:14.114 --> 01:23:15.945
She is Syrena.

01:23:56.949 --> 01:23:58.439
Ponce de Leon.

01:24:02.162 --> 01:24:05.825
If 40 pirates dreamt 40 nights of treasure,

01:24:05.825 --> 01:24:09.537
it would not match
the contents of this room.

01:24:09.537 --> 01:24:11.247
You.

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:15.835
- You.
- No...

01:24:17.010 --> 01:24:19.251
...you. I was here first.

01:24:19.251 --> 01:24:23.422
- You, why are you here?
- Blackbeard sent me.

01:24:23.422 --> 01:24:26.057
- Why are you?
- Silver chalices....

01:24:26.057 --> 01:24:29.561
....for my royal liege. Oh, please.

01:24:30.857 --> 01:24:32.597
Back, back. We have to balance it out.

01:24:34.611 --> 01:24:37.193
The whole ship will slide.

01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:42.574
Right, then.

01:24:42.574 --> 01:24:48.660
What if we each choose an item
of approximately equal weight?

01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:52.746
Put it back.

01:24:54.298 --> 01:24:56.334
We touch nothing.

01:25:04.266 --> 01:25:05.221
What about that?

01:25:05.221 --> 01:25:07.724
The chalices.

01:25:09.479 --> 01:25:10.969
Oi. Why do you get to look first?

01:25:10.969 --> 01:25:12.809
Fine, then.

01:25:32.085 --> 01:25:33.621
- Together.
- Together.

01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:37.370
Rocks.

01:25:38.467 --> 01:25:39.798
The Spanish.

01:25:40.552 --> 01:25:42.213
They're ahead of us, mate.

01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:46.380
I shall have a look at that map.
If it's what I fear...

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:58.692
I wonder why they left this behind.

01:26:01.698 --> 01:26:05.441
Don't touch the map.

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:11.912
They know the path,

01:26:11.912 --> 01:26:15.952
but I can also see where
they will most likely make camp.

01:26:29.434 --> 01:26:30.719
Jack.

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:38.057
Gibbs, I was just on me way
to break you out of jail.

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:41.518
You stole my map.

01:26:42.114 --> 01:26:44.526
Right. Best be started.

01:26:47.619 --> 01:26:49.109
Ole.

01:27:06.513 --> 01:27:08.003
Mermaids.

01:27:10.851 --> 01:27:13.763
Careful, these pools run deep.

01:27:13.763 --> 01:27:17.475
If she escapes, all is lost.
Quartermaster.

01:27:19.151 --> 01:27:22.393
Look. Look.

01:27:24.030 --> 01:27:26.942
Staked out to die, to dry in the sun.

01:27:26.942 --> 01:27:30.701
Only half in the water.
Not enough to live,

01:27:30.701 --> 01:27:35.035
but just enough to make the dying slow.

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:37.240
Think on it.

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:40.786
Your people, murdered,
harvested for their tears.

01:27:40.786 --> 01:27:45.253
Syrena, won't you cry?

01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:47.964
All die, even you.

01:27:47.964 --> 01:27:51.551
- Soon, I hear.
- Listen...

01:27:53.643 --> 01:27:55.474
Listen.

01:27:55.474 --> 01:27:58.933
Can you not hear your sisters scream?

01:27:58.933 --> 01:28:01.519
Do you not hear them?

01:28:02.569 --> 01:28:05.356
We need but one tear.

01:28:08.241 --> 01:28:09.526
Vile creature.

01:28:09.526 --> 01:28:12.238
- Chop off her fingers, one by one.
- Choke her.

01:28:12.238 --> 01:28:14.994
Cut out the tears
from behind the eyes.

01:28:14.994 --> 01:28:16.450
Where's your voice in this?

01:28:17.375 --> 01:28:20.367
Maybe she will have a change of heart
when the sun rises.

01:28:20.367 --> 01:28:24.413
Oh, aye, she will burn,
but I cannot wait for the sun.

01:28:24.413 --> 01:28:26.252
Perhaps we should build a fire.

01:28:26.252 --> 01:28:28.542
- No.
- Do not contest me, cleric.

01:28:28.542 --> 01:28:31.757
- You will not torture her.
- We need only one tear.

01:28:31.757 --> 01:28:35.049
I will tear every scale
from her body one by one if I see fit.

01:28:35.049 --> 01:28:36.763
If that displeases you, go pray.

01:28:36.763 --> 01:28:40.020
I was wrong. Not every soul
can be saved. Yours cannot.

01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:43.023
Behold, gentlemen,
a man formerly of faith.

01:28:43.023 --> 01:28:46.060
That vile creature, as you call her,
is worth a hundred of you.

01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:47.944
Oh, you care for her?

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:51.982
You fancy her.

01:28:53.703 --> 01:28:56.410
And do not deny what is
clear to my eyes.

01:28:58.250 --> 01:28:59.330
Question is...

01:29:02.546 --> 01:29:04.502
...does she fancy you?

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:10.338
By God, she does. We are in luck.

01:29:11.805 --> 01:29:13.636
Bring forth a tear...

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:17.674
...or witness the death
of this poor soul.

01:29:19.855 --> 01:29:23.268
Syrena, if you could manage a tear,

01:29:23.268 --> 01:29:24.977
I would be grateful.

01:29:26.361 --> 01:29:27.942
Sadness, yes,

01:29:27.942 --> 01:29:33.483
but no sorrow... yet.
Not by your hand, Father.

01:29:33.483 --> 01:29:36.276
Time and tide wait for none.
Quartermaster.

01:29:48.633 --> 01:29:52.091
Aye, mermaids are tough.

01:29:52.091 --> 01:29:54.253
The lot of them.

01:29:54.253 --> 01:29:58.800
Tie her up like the others.
And get rid of this.

01:30:03.398 --> 01:30:06.356
- You are confident?
- Yes.

01:30:06.356 --> 01:30:09.484
I am a woman. So is she.

01:30:17.537 --> 01:30:20.529
What's your play, Jack?
Throwing in with Barbossa.

01:30:21.625 --> 01:30:23.365
There is a girl...

01:30:23.365 --> 01:30:26.706
...a female... of the opposite sex.

01:30:26.706 --> 01:30:30.793
- When is there not?
- Perhaps I should say "damsel."

01:30:30.793 --> 01:30:33.959
You're rescuing a damsel?
Well, there's a first.

01:30:33.959 --> 01:30:37.345
Yes, but it's just that
I may have caused said damsel....

01:30:37.345 --> 01:30:41.053
...some manner of harm many moons ago.
Out with it.

01:30:41.053 --> 01:30:44.515
Gibbs, this is the woman from Seville.

01:30:44.515 --> 01:30:48.557
Ah, you pretended to love her,
then you left her and broke her heart.

01:30:48.557 --> 01:30:53.399
Worse. I may have had,
briefly, mind you...

01:30:55.617 --> 01:30:58.734
...stirrings. Stirrings?

01:30:58.734 --> 01:31:02.871
- Stirrings.
- What? Like feelings, you mean?

01:31:02.871 --> 01:31:06.033
No, no, no. Not quite all the way
to feelings. More like...

01:31:10.173 --> 01:31:11.754
All right, feelings, damn you.

01:31:11.754 --> 01:31:16.589
And you left her still.
That's low.

01:31:18.056 --> 01:31:19.262
Thank you.

01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:27.599
Stealth over force.

01:31:27.599 --> 01:31:31.483
I will take it from here
on account of your condition.

01:31:32.654 --> 01:31:34.485
You don't have termites, do you?

01:31:34.485 --> 01:31:36.612
I appreciate your concern, Jack,

01:31:36.612 --> 01:31:39.274
but I will be keeping
you company all the same.

01:31:39.274 --> 01:31:42.489
Hold here, Lieutenant Commander.
Wait for my signal.

01:32:14.487 --> 01:32:16.569
There. That one.
That be the leader.

01:32:16.569 --> 01:32:19.197
Make note of his tent
because that's where...

01:32:20.702 --> 01:32:24.911
No, wait. By God,
that must be them right there.

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:30.667
Your sword smells funny.

01:32:30.667 --> 01:32:35.706
Aye. Poison from the
innards of poisonous toads.

01:32:35.706 --> 01:32:38.967
Just a scratch,
you're a dead man in minutes.

01:32:38.967 --> 01:32:41.423
Would you mind pointing it
the other way?

01:32:41.423 --> 01:32:43.338
I don't like toads.

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:51.642
- What are you doing?
- Planning an escape route.

01:32:51.642 --> 01:32:55.855
- Isn't that how you do it?
- Yes.

01:32:55.855 --> 01:32:59.112
Or sometimes I just... improvise.

01:33:26.142 --> 01:33:27.598
Now what?

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:31.011
We stroll out, slow and steady.

01:33:31.011 --> 01:33:32.975
Just like we belong.

01:34:32.458 --> 01:34:36.667
- I am sorry, Syrena.
- Philip, you're alive.

01:34:36.667 --> 01:34:41.002
- Yes.
- You came for me.

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:44.376
Why?

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:48.800
You're different, are you not?

01:34:51.019 --> 01:34:55.353
Do you know not of kindness?
Compassion?

01:35:12.582 --> 01:35:14.538
Tears of sorrow, never.

01:35:14.538 --> 01:35:17.121
Mermaids be too tough for that.

01:35:17.121 --> 01:35:19.411
But tears of joy...

01:35:20.965 --> 01:35:23.331
They say these be
the more potent anyway.

01:35:23.331 --> 01:35:26.467
Syrena, on my word,
I had no part in this.

01:35:27.764 --> 01:35:29.174
Let her go.
You don't need her now.

01:35:29.174 --> 01:35:32.261
Let her go? No.

01:35:32.261 --> 01:35:35.393
Secure her bonds.
We leave her with her own.

01:35:44.989 --> 01:35:46.945
How's that escape route working?

01:35:46.945 --> 01:35:50.028
Here's your chance to improvise.

01:35:50.028 --> 01:35:51.488
I am attempting it.

01:35:51.488 --> 01:35:54.450
I might be able to get a hand loose.

01:35:54.450 --> 01:35:56.865
Oh, you got a knife.
That's very good.

01:35:58.002 --> 01:35:59.492
Better.

01:36:04.968 --> 01:36:06.208
I want one of those.

01:36:10.932 --> 01:36:15.141
Here's to revenge. Sweet and clear.

01:36:15.141 --> 01:36:19.725
- Revenge?
- Come, come, Hector.

01:36:19.725 --> 01:36:21.264
If you wanted the chalices,

01:36:21.264 --> 01:36:24.104
you'd seen they were missing and gone.

01:36:24.104 --> 01:36:27.396
You were lying in wait, for Blackbeard.

01:36:29.409 --> 01:36:32.617
King George. Privateer. Wig.

01:36:33.788 --> 01:36:35.198
Cheap theatrical facade.

01:36:35.198 --> 01:36:38.206
- I am not buying it.
- You weren't there that night.

01:36:38.206 --> 01:36:42.164
- When the Pearl was lost?
- Taken, not lost.

01:36:44.799 --> 01:36:48.917
We were off the coast of Hispaniola
when we came under attack.

01:36:48.917 --> 01:36:52.508
No provocation nor warning
nor offer of parley.

01:36:52.508 --> 01:36:55.298
We were peppered with cannon fire.

01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:59.685
And then the sea beneath
the Pearl began to roil.

01:37:01.274 --> 01:37:03.640
The Pearl was pitching
and yawing violently.

01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:05.649
Every plank, every rail,

01:37:05.649 --> 01:37:08.653
every spar, all at once,
began to creak.

01:37:08.653 --> 01:37:11.815
The rigging had come to life.

01:37:11.815 --> 01:37:14.655
Our own ship turned against us...

01:37:14.655 --> 01:37:18.071
...tangling the crew,
wrapping around them like snakes.

01:37:18.071 --> 01:37:20.615
And wrapping around me leg.

01:37:20.615 --> 01:37:23.159
But me arms were free
and me sword was to hand.

01:37:23.159 --> 01:37:26.830
I am the master of me ship,
not Blackbeard.

01:37:26.830 --> 01:37:30.466
I am the master of my fate,
not Blackbeard.

01:37:31.512 --> 01:37:33.844
So I did what needed done.

01:37:40.730 --> 01:37:42.641
I survived.

01:37:44.233 --> 01:37:48.397
So... you're not after the Fountain.

01:37:48.397 --> 01:37:52.189
I care not for King George
or tavern yarns

01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:54.574
that give hope for a healed limb.

01:37:56.245 --> 01:37:59.863
But I'd give my left arm
for a chance at Blackbeard.

01:37:59.863 --> 01:38:03.033
- Not your right?
- I need me good arm

01:38:03.033 --> 01:38:07.830
to drive my poisoned blade
through his heart.

01:38:08.841 --> 01:38:11.253
I will see you get the chance, mate.

01:39:30.047 --> 01:39:31.332
The prisoner's escaping.

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:41.301
He's escaping.
Fan out. Find him.

01:39:41.301 --> 01:39:42.556
Go. Go.

01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:47.478
Hold your fire. I want him alive.

01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:57.651
I figured that was the signal.

01:40:40.785 --> 01:40:44.243
- Go. Prepare to move out.
- The enemy is soon upon us.

01:40:45.998 --> 01:40:48.910
I am sorry about the chalices, Jack,
but I have an appointment to keep.

01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:52.043
- I will not be going back.
- No need.

01:40:52.043 --> 01:40:55.205
- Shall we have a drink?
- We will drink at the Fountain.

01:41:13.609 --> 01:41:17.147
How is it we can never meet
without you pointing something at me?

01:41:18.364 --> 01:41:20.229
You brought the chalices, Sparrow?

01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:22.789
- Aye. 
- Oi.

01:41:26.497 --> 01:41:29.580
- I see you brought a friend.
- I did.

01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:32.958
And the one-legged man, he is near.
Aye?

01:41:32.958 --> 01:41:34.494
Aye.

01:41:35.339 --> 01:41:36.328
Now...

01:41:36.328 --> 01:41:39.294
Before I go just handing them over,
I do have one or two conditions.

01:41:39.294 --> 01:41:41.504
- Name them.
- Firstly,

01:41:41.504 --> 01:41:44.011
I will be having me compass back.
No, no, that's secondly.

01:41:44.011 --> 01:41:46.388
Firstly, upon your word,

01:41:46.388 --> 01:41:48.515
you will bring no harm to Angelica.

01:41:48.515 --> 01:41:51.018
I will make no vows
to the likes of you, Sparrow.

01:41:51.018 --> 01:41:53.600
But it costs me nothing to admit

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:56.607
that she was never in harm's way.

01:41:57.278 --> 01:41:59.439
Secondly then, priorly firstly,

01:41:59.439 --> 01:42:01.229
I will be having me compass back.

01:42:02.158 --> 01:42:04.149
Please? I do deserve it.

01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:07.785
Do you have any idea how difficult
it was to catch that filthy pig?

01:42:07.785 --> 01:42:10.287
Not the big one,
the four-legged one.

01:42:13.753 --> 01:42:17.496
Thank you. And thirdly, Mr. Beard,

01:42:17.496 --> 01:42:20.335
there are times, not very often,

01:42:20.335 --> 01:42:23.592
when I do reflect
upon my heinous misdeeds.

01:42:23.592 --> 01:42:28.006
Chief among them, I note how poorly
I have treated Mr. Gibbs,

01:42:28.006 --> 01:42:30.800
my loyal first mate.
Aye. Now you bring it up...

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:33.640
Left him to rot in jail, I did.
Didn't care.

01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:38.433
Still don't. But, point being,
you must let him go free.

01:42:40.321 --> 01:42:43.654
- Is that it?
- I think so.

01:42:43.654 --> 01:42:46.406
Quick, or the pig runs,
and good luck getting those chalices.

01:42:46.406 --> 01:42:47.987
Jack, if it's all the same to you,
I'd be just as...

01:42:47.987 --> 01:42:49.447
Done.

01:42:49.447 --> 01:42:50.782
Release the swine.

01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:59.837
Perhaps, if you don't mind,
I could tag along with you folk for a...

01:43:02.635 --> 01:43:04.842
This will lead you to freedom, mate.

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:14.393
I could have swore it was
somewhere right around here.

01:44:44.528 --> 01:44:46.860
We must not stop.

01:45:04.215 --> 01:45:05.580
Dead end.

01:45:06.634 --> 01:45:08.545
Dead. End.

01:45:09.261 --> 01:45:10.626
Dead end.

01:45:11.722 --> 01:45:14.634
Jack, I am starting to think
you don't know where you're going.

01:45:15.476 --> 01:45:18.263
It is not the destination
so much as the journey, they say.

01:45:19.522 --> 01:45:20.932
Chalices, if you please.

01:45:32.993 --> 01:45:34.483
Stand back.

01:45:56.892 --> 01:45:58.428
Jack...

01:45:58.428 --> 01:46:00.433
...have you ever, in fact...

01:46:00.433 --> 01:46:06.144
...seen with your own eyes...
the Fountain of Youth?

01:46:06.144 --> 01:46:08.479
I am sorry, could you
repeat the question, please?

01:46:08.479 --> 01:46:10.110
Quartermaster.

01:46:11.073 --> 01:46:11.983
No, no.

01:46:15.703 --> 01:46:17.819
Wait, wait. Wait.

01:46:21.125 --> 01:46:25.539
"Aqua... de Vida."

01:47:04.919 --> 01:47:07.410
Master Scrum...

01:47:07.410 --> 01:47:10.421
...do you mind? Squire?

01:48:09.149 --> 01:48:11.105
So beautiful.

01:48:50.249 --> 01:48:53.931
Sparrow, I will be the first
to taste those waters.

01:48:57.740 --> 01:48:59.321
Father.

01:49:02.619 --> 01:49:04.860
The one-legged man.

01:49:07.458 --> 01:49:11.371
- You brought him here.
- Would I do that?

01:49:11.371 --> 01:49:13.627
Edward Teach.

01:49:13.627 --> 01:49:17.039
For crimes committed on the high seas,

01:49:17.039 --> 01:49:21.051
by the authority granted me
by His Majesty the King...

01:49:21.051 --> 01:49:24.384
...and with a goodly amount
of personal satisfaction...

01:49:24.384 --> 01:49:27.595
...I hereby place you
in the custody of the court,

01:49:27.595 --> 01:49:31.058
and declare you to be my prisoner.

01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:35.641
My trick's out, is that it?

01:49:35.641 --> 01:49:40.188
Such crimes do include, but are not
limited to, piracy, treason,

01:49:40.188 --> 01:49:44.483
murder, torture of
the most heinous sort,

01:49:44.483 --> 01:49:48.529
including the brutal theft of one used,
twisted, hairy right leg.

01:49:49.374 --> 01:49:54.038
You... dare face this sword?

01:49:54.038 --> 01:49:56.625
This far away from your ship? Aye.

01:49:56.625 --> 01:50:01.509
Aye. That be the cold breath
of fate I feel down my nape.

01:50:01.509 --> 01:50:07.298
But I will have one last fight, by God.

01:50:07.298 --> 01:50:09.182
Kill them all.

01:50:10.854 --> 01:50:12.594
Hang on a minute.

01:50:12.594 --> 01:50:16.641
I just... I just need
to understand something.

01:50:16.641 --> 01:50:20.152
Right, so, you will fight against them,

01:50:20.152 --> 01:50:21.607
they will fight against you.

01:50:21.607 --> 01:50:25.445
All on account of him
wanting to kill him?

01:50:25.445 --> 01:50:29.532
Where is the sense? Exactly.

01:50:29.532 --> 01:50:33.415
I say, let them fight
each other while we lay back,

01:50:33.415 --> 01:50:36.998
watch, have a drink,
place some wagers.

01:50:38.132 --> 01:50:39.417
Aye.

01:50:42.010 --> 01:50:44.291
- Kill them.
- No quarter.

01:51:14.126 --> 01:51:15.741
Get off me.

01:51:48.744 --> 01:51:49.733
Scrum, the chalices.

01:51:51.914 --> 01:51:52.994
And the tear. Follow.

01:51:57.044 --> 01:51:58.204
Fight.

01:51:59.171 --> 01:52:02.663
Hand it over. The tear.
There's a good lad.

01:52:02.663 --> 01:52:05.127
I am more afraid of her
than I am of you.

01:52:10.682 --> 01:52:13.048
Hand it over.
There's a good lad.

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:20.189
- The chalices, if you please.
- Sorry, Jack.

01:52:20.189 --> 01:52:24.568
I told you, I need years.
And now, yours will do.

01:52:32.537 --> 01:52:33.697
Scrum.

01:52:55.394 --> 01:52:56.850
Syrena...

01:53:00.565 --> 01:53:03.352
Oh God, you will not take her.

01:53:03.352 --> 01:53:08.442
If you have taken her,
you will give her back.

01:53:08.442 --> 01:53:10.947
Give her back...

01:53:10.947 --> 01:53:13.951
Give her back, please. Please.

01:53:37.602 --> 01:53:40.309
I expected fate
to put up more of a fight, eh?

01:53:57.205 --> 01:54:00.914
I will not have that smile
on your face as I strike you down.

01:54:02.419 --> 01:54:05.456
Take a gander, Edward Teach.

01:54:36.036 --> 01:54:39.324
This land is hereby forever
claimed in the glorious name

01:54:39.324 --> 01:54:42.035
of His Majesty King George...

01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:51.207
Someone make a note
of that man's bravery.

01:54:58.225 --> 01:55:01.934
Senorita, the chalices, por favor.

01:55:18.662 --> 01:55:24.282
Only God can grant eternal life,
not this pagan water.

01:55:35.387 --> 01:55:38.845
Men, destroy this profane temple.

01:55:41.601 --> 01:55:42.886
The Fountain.

01:55:56.992 --> 01:55:58.482
You are a fool.

01:55:58.482 --> 01:56:01.902
You seek in this place
what only faith can provide.

01:56:01.902 --> 01:56:04.571
Faith? In faith,
there is light enough to see

01:56:04.571 --> 01:56:06.956
but darkness enough to blind.

01:56:10.589 --> 01:56:12.830
What devilry is this?

01:56:16.845 --> 01:56:19.427
- For the Pearl..
- What have you done?

01:56:22.976 --> 01:56:25.342
Angelica. Don't. It's poison.

01:56:30.025 --> 01:56:32.311
I am not such the fool
to take on Blackbeard

01:56:32.311 --> 01:56:35.853
without a little venomous advantage.

01:56:37.199 --> 01:56:38.655
Jack.

01:56:50.504 --> 01:56:52.540
I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew,

01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:56.127
and this sword,
payment for my missing limb.

01:57:10.565 --> 01:57:11.930
Hang on. Pull.

01:57:57.237 --> 01:57:59.569
Do not waste my tear.

01:58:29.060 --> 01:58:31.176
Drink this.
This one has the tear.

01:58:31.176 --> 01:58:33.310
- You must drink the other.
- No.

01:58:34.107 --> 01:58:37.315
I cannot save you both.
One of you must sacrifice.

01:58:38.278 --> 01:58:41.361
You take it, Father, for your soul.

01:58:43.408 --> 01:58:48.823
Captain Teach, she's dying.
You must save your daughter.

01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:52.782
This one takes life?

01:58:52.782 --> 01:58:54.790
This one has the tear and gives life?

01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:56.201
Aye, hurry.

01:59:05.138 --> 01:59:09.381
Angelica...
Save me, my child.

01:59:11.311 --> 01:59:12.061
No.

01:59:21.446 --> 01:59:22.856
I love you, Father.

01:59:35.877 --> 01:59:37.458
Wait a minute.

01:59:39.673 --> 01:59:42.460
In fact, it might have been
the other way around.

01:59:43.343 --> 01:59:47.131
This cup had the tear,
that one had the other bit.

01:59:47.131 --> 01:59:48.511
Trickster.

01:59:48.511 --> 01:59:50.513
- Devil.
- Father.

01:59:57.565 --> 01:59:59.055
You bastard. How could you?

02:00:00.110 --> 02:00:01.520
Your father saved you.

02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:04.186
Perhaps his soul is now redeemed, eh?

02:01:05.049 --> 02:01:07.131
You are hurt.

02:01:09.387 --> 02:01:11.252
In body only.

02:01:12.974 --> 02:01:17.183
My mind is at peace...
because of you.

02:01:18.271 --> 02:01:21.104
- Me?
- Yes.

02:01:22.150 --> 02:01:24.516
I was lost.

02:01:25.528 --> 02:01:30.147
The wind, the tides...

02:01:30.147 --> 02:01:33.362
...they ought to renew a man's faith.

02:01:34.954 --> 02:01:36.865
But for me, only you.

02:01:37.791 --> 02:01:41.500
Philip, I can save you.

02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:44.581
You need only ask.

02:01:46.090 --> 02:01:50.834
- I seek but one thing.
- What is that?

02:01:51.888 --> 02:01:54.220
Forgiveness.

02:01:54.220 --> 02:01:57.678
If not for me, you would
never have been captured.

02:01:57.678 --> 02:01:59.467
Ask.

02:02:01.397 --> 02:02:03.183
Forgive me?

02:02:28.341 --> 02:02:29.547
I hate you.

02:02:29.547 --> 02:02:32.003
The bloke who saved your life?

02:02:32.003 --> 02:02:35.341
The years I possess,
stolen from my own father.

02:02:35.341 --> 02:02:38.507
I only helped Blackbeard do what
any father should have done.

02:02:38.507 --> 02:02:41.848
You are cruel and ignorant.

02:02:45.608 --> 02:02:49.351
One pistol, one shot.

02:02:49.351 --> 02:02:51.736
To kill myself before I starve?

02:02:51.736 --> 02:02:53.442
There's no trusting you, love.

02:02:53.442 --> 02:02:56.028
Besides, this is a
well-traveled trade route.

02:02:56.028 --> 02:02:57.783
You can signal a passing ship.

02:02:57.783 --> 02:03:01.367
Or you can just bite the
proverbial bullet, as it were.

02:03:01.367 --> 02:03:03.122
And how will I get free
of these bonds?

02:03:03.122 --> 02:03:06.000
You broke free of your bonds
half an hour ago,

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.957
waiting for the precise moment
to pounce.

02:03:11.676 --> 02:03:13.337
Admit it, Jack.

02:03:13.337 --> 02:03:17.379
- You still love me.
- If you had a sister and a dog,

02:03:17.379 --> 02:03:19.843
I'd choose the dog.

02:03:19.843 --> 02:03:23.351
Treasure.
There is a chest with jewels.

02:03:23.351 --> 02:03:25.728
Jewels with the power
to rule the wind and tide.

02:03:25.728 --> 02:03:28.982
- You're making that up.
- Wait...

02:03:29.819 --> 02:03:33.482
I am with child. Yours.

02:03:34.741 --> 02:03:36.106
I don't recall that we ever had...

02:03:36.106 --> 02:03:38.991
You were drunk.
I have actually never been that drunk.

02:03:38.991 --> 02:03:40.242
Wait.

02:03:42.165 --> 02:03:44.201
There is something I want to say to you.

02:03:44.201 --> 02:03:48.539
Something I wanted to say
from the moment we first met.

02:03:49.505 --> 02:03:50.585
Go on, then.

02:03:52.967 --> 02:03:54.252
I love you.

02:03:57.889 --> 02:03:59.675
As do I.

02:03:59.675 --> 02:04:03.262
Always have. Always will.

02:04:07.815 --> 02:04:09.271
I got to go.

02:04:09.271 --> 02:04:10.431
Jack.

02:04:12.779 --> 02:04:14.360
This is not over.

02:04:15.448 --> 02:04:16.483
Jack.

02:04:26.084 --> 02:04:27.574
Missed.

02:04:42.892 --> 02:04:45.884
The Revenge is mine.

02:04:52.610 --> 02:04:54.020
Sir...

02:04:56.531 --> 02:04:58.362
We found this below decks.

02:05:24.475 --> 02:05:26.716
All hands.
Ply to windward.

02:05:26.716 --> 02:05:30.432
Get cracking,
ye blooming cockroaches.

02:05:33.151 --> 02:05:35.733
The Crown served me well.

02:05:35.733 --> 02:05:38.861
But now, by the gods of sea and sky...

02:05:38.861 --> 02:05:43.116
...make way for Tortuga.

02:05:54.255 --> 02:05:57.372
Gibbs, you filthy, besotted shellback,
you made it.

02:05:57.372 --> 02:05:59.086
Aye.

02:05:59.086 --> 02:06:00.750
And I trust we managed a profit

02:06:00.750 --> 02:06:05.137
from our joint enterprise?
Feast your eyes.

02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:12.720
The compass led me straight and true.

02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:14.855
What of Blackbeard's men
guarding the ship?

02:06:14.855 --> 02:06:18.860
I employed the selfsame maneuver
we perfected in New Guinea.

02:06:18.860 --> 02:06:23.069
Seemed a shame to leave
an entire fleet behind.

02:06:23.069 --> 02:06:25.278
Shame indeed.

02:06:37.256 --> 02:06:38.587
I hate that monkey.

02:06:38.587 --> 02:06:42.171
So, the Pearl....
Any idea how to get her out?

02:06:42.171 --> 02:06:45.337
We shall need a crossbow,
an hourglass, three goats.

02:06:45.337 --> 02:06:48.507
One of us must learn to play the trumpet
whilst the other one goes like this...

02:06:49.060 --> 02:06:52.302
- I know a man with a goat.
- Good. I can go like this.

02:06:54.982 --> 02:06:56.597
Jack, I have to ask...

02:06:56.597 --> 02:06:59.609
You had the chalices,
the water, the tear...

02:06:59.609 --> 02:07:02.270
You could have lived maybe forever.

02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:04.404
The Fountain does test you, Gibbs.

02:07:04.404 --> 02:07:07.442
But better to not know
which moment may be your last.

02:07:07.442 --> 02:07:09.611
Every morsel of your entire being

02:07:09.611 --> 02:07:12.872
alive to the infinite mystery of it all.

02:07:12.872 --> 02:07:15.533
And who's to say
I won't live forever, eh?

02:07:15.533 --> 02:07:18.794
Discoverer of the Fountain of Youth.

02:07:18.794 --> 02:07:21.832
I have no say in it, Gibbs.

02:07:21.832 --> 02:07:23.965
It's a pirate's life for me.

02:07:24.929 --> 02:07:26.419
Savvy?
