00:58.580 --> 01:01.480
In the year 1173 of our Lord,

01:02.451 --> 01:04.541
Europe was divided between the two great powers,

01:04.620 --> 01:06.451
England and France.

01:07.550 --> 01:11.450
The children of the King of England, Richard, Henry and Geoffrey the young,

01:11.561 --> 01:14.580
driven by his French mother, Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine,

01:15.491 --> 01:18.461
They rebelled to usurp the throne of his powerful father

01:18.561 --> 01:21.590
and started a fight to conquer their territory on French soil.

01:25.571 --> 01:30.471
Richard the Lionheart A REBELLION

01:31.582 --> 01:33.611
King Louis invited the rebels to come to Paris

01:33.651 --> 01:36.511
and sign a formal alliance against a common enemy.

01:38.451 --> 01:42.482
But the weapons of steel does not always determine the outcome of a war.

01:43.621 --> 01:47.621
NORTH CASTLE FRANCE TREPORT

01:49.621 --> 01:53.122
Subpack by DanDee

02:10.483 --> 02:11.453
Madam...

02:16.592 --> 02:18.422
Your Majesty?

02:18.523 --> 02:19.493
Where is it?

02:21.492 --> 02:23.482
You know what I missed in England?

02:25.633 --> 02:30.573
English men are rude, often stink,

02:32.503 --> 02:33.563
but their spears

02:34.573 --> 02:38.534
They know very well the moment to strike.

02:41.513 --> 02:44.453
The English know when to attack and ...

02:44.584 --> 02:46.524
They know when to expect,

02:47.524 --> 02:50.513
the nature of people living on the island.

02:52.524 --> 02:54.464
I am the Queen of England.

02:54.593 --> 02:57.534
Ask and I will do anything you want, ma'am.

03:02.604 --> 03:06.505
English women do not need to ask.

03:06.545 --> 03:10.534
They attack their targets directly ...

03:12.444 --> 03:13.504
at your command.

03:14.484 --> 03:15.454
Madam...

03:16.485 --> 03:20.586
And that's why the English have always defeated the French.

03:21.595 --> 03:24.495
They are not afraid to try different things.

03:44.586 --> 03:45.516
Madam,

03:45.585 --> 03:51.486
I agreed to meet her at this location and his company gave me great pleasure,

03:53.496 --> 03:54.545
but it is asking too much.

04:11.607 --> 04:14.447
Who are you and what are you doing on my land?

04:15.447 --> 04:18.577
I came to rescue the queen Eleanor of Aquitaine.

04:19.416 --> 04:22.547
The queen is my guest. I promised her I would be safe here.

04:23.556 --> 04:25.547
Are not you forgetting something?

04:29.458 --> 04:30.447
Or pact.

04:31.566 --> 04:33.467
I will read later, ma'am.

04:33.567 --> 04:35.557
You need not bother.

04:39.567 --> 04:42.478
You are a knight, right?

04:42.608 --> 04:45.407
Yes sir. This is the castle of my family.

04:45.477 --> 04:47.617
We defend these lands during the English conquest

04:47.647 --> 04:49.447
soldiers like you.

05:06.469 --> 05:09.529
All you need to do is take your ring

05:11.468 --> 05:13.458
and put this wax.

05:13.578 --> 05:15.478
Not think it's the right time.

05:29.489 --> 05:31.459
You will not leave this room ...

05:32.629 --> 05:36.459
without meeting me completely.

05:36.529 --> 05:37.500
And if I leave?

05:56.549 --> 05:57.520
Dad!

06:02.560 --> 06:07.430
Your family, your property and your cattle will be burned.

06:08.460 --> 06:10.360
You disappear from history.

06:10.431 --> 06:13.530
So I think it would be a bad decision.

06:42.462 --> 06:46.462
I like men who know how to anticipate the needs of a woman.

07:19.473 --> 07:20.462
Dad!

07:30.453 --> 07:31.543
You killed my father!

07:33.453 --> 07:34.443
You deserve to die!

07:43.563 --> 07:46.583
Her husband, Henry II, King of England,

07:47.564 --> 07:49.534
orders the lady with me.

07:50.573 --> 07:54.524
Consider arrested by the will of His Majesty.

07:55.644 --> 07:58.544
At least I did my last alliance.

08:01.483 --> 08:02.444
Now ...

08:04.515 --> 08:06.505
The king wants me to go dressed like that?

08:07.455 --> 08:09.474
Or I can dress like the queen that I am?

08:24.575 --> 08:29.505
WEST FRANCE BATTLE OF DEVIL'S BRIDGE

09:55.468 --> 09:57.527
Abandon this flag, or abandon his life.

09:58.437 --> 10:01.408
You have a chance to join us against our father, the king.

10:38.608 --> 10:40.579
Ricardo, my brother.

10:41.649 --> 10:43.549
Now the king of France awaits us.

10:44.649 --> 10:48.480
Closer to our beloved father step.

11:27.660 --> 11:30.492
My sweet and beloved wife.

11:30.601 --> 11:32.561
The maid of Aquitaine.

11:33.601 --> 11:38.591
The last ground of a kingdom kissing our lips during the day

11:39.542 --> 11:42.512
and cut our throats at night.

11:42.571 --> 11:45.471
You're too dramatic, no?

12:02.532 --> 12:06.603
Perhaps one of his men have poisoned wine. That would be...

12:06.633 --> 12:07.592
I do not drink.

12:10.642 --> 12:11.602
Leave us alone.

12:20.582 --> 12:21.572
Por quÃª?

12:25.623 --> 12:27.582
You do not understand the question?

12:28.653 --> 12:31.623
Or did not understand the seriousness of the matter?

12:32.592 --> 12:36.493
Because you're a bastard.

12:37.634 --> 12:39.604
I made for my children ...

12:41.503 --> 12:46.544
By their choice to send Ricardo to that odious castle.

12:46.574 --> 12:47.563
He almost died!

12:48.574 --> 12:52.443
I did it because I hate you!

12:54.683 --> 12:59.514
Because it is always selfish.

13:02.594 --> 13:06.585
You know how this feud family is costing us?

13:07.594 --> 13:11.554
You will give everything to Ricardo, whether you win or not!

13:11.634 --> 13:14.534
You will lose anyway.

13:14.574 --> 13:16.524
I doubt it.

13:17.545 --> 13:20.504
Armies cost money, travel too!

13:20.545 --> 13:22.475
Even the riders have a price!

13:22.574 --> 13:25.584
We're at a time to fight for it!

13:25.615 --> 13:27.605
So give me what I want!

13:28.555 --> 13:30.615
Just so I end the rebellion.

13:33.525 --> 13:34.545
I can not!

13:34.625 --> 13:35.596
Por quÃª?

13:36.594 --> 13:38.495
Why am I a woman?

13:40.465 --> 13:43.435
If I had Mii riders like you in my army,

13:43.494 --> 13:45.525
already would be emperor of the world!

13:49.534 --> 13:52.505
It is because you are a foreigner,

13:52.645 --> 13:55.636
your fucking French! Whore!

13:57.546 --> 14:00.486
Meet their demands would be like kissing

14:00.516 --> 14:03.556
the rear of King Louis after going to the bathroom!

14:03.585 --> 14:05.385
It's impossible!

14:05.486 --> 14:06.586
So I'm sorry for you ...

14:08.556 --> 14:10.456
because I will not stop.

14:17.636 --> 14:22.467
We could be allies perfect ...

14:23.506 --> 14:26.537
if we could stop fighting against each other.

14:30.547 --> 14:31.536
Admit ...

14:33.517 --> 14:35.547
you do not have the courage for that.

14:37.557 --> 14:38.577
Get her out of here!

14:42.558 --> 14:45.556
It's the last time I make a mistake as unforgivable.

14:51.508 --> 14:54.598
Besides current not forget gag.

14:56.508 --> 14:58.477
Let's leave it quiet for a while.

15:09.488 --> 15:10.459
Burn it all!

15:25.437 --> 15:28.469
CREPORT CASTLE

15:34.479 --> 15:37.469
DEVIL'S BRIDGE

15:38.519 --> 15:40.609
Compiegne Forest

16:10.421 --> 16:11.410
Why this reception?

16:12.491 --> 16:14.420
We are the children of the king they hate!

16:15.521 --> 16:18.461
We are also people who want to steal your crown,

16:18.590 --> 16:21.531
and we were invited by the king himself.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.590
Go take those clothes.

16:27.641 --> 16:30.572
I will provide our thanks to King Louis.

16:44.552 --> 16:45.541
They are far behind.

16:46.592 --> 16:48.581
Our father should already be on the way.

16:49.491 --> 16:53.482
His father did not know anything. Relax and enjoy your wine.

16:53.562 --> 16:54.591
The king knows everything.

16:55.502 --> 16:58.562
Just a man with a silly crown on his head. He is not God!

17:02.541 --> 17:03.541
Geoffrey.

17:03.571 --> 17:04.561
You're late, brother.

17:05.541 --> 17:06.531
Where is Ricardo?

17:07.472 --> 17:08.502
Away from it all.

17:09.482 --> 17:12.502
Welcome to my tent hunting. But stay tuned,

17:13.452 --> 17:16.422
sometimes the hunter becomes the hunted.

17:16.550 --> 17:18.422
E vice-versa.

17:18.622 --> 17:19.593
Ally.

17:21.492 --> 17:23.551
Let's drink.

18:07.534 --> 18:08.504
Excuse me.

18:16.614 --> 18:18.444
Do not worry about it.

18:19.485 --> 18:21.386
I do not feel any more pain.

18:25.524 --> 18:29.425
I am at your disposal, sir. They are king.

18:36.635 --> 18:38.464
I'll pray for you.

18:42.645 --> 18:46.576
I understand that this puts my kingdom at risk?

18:47.576 --> 18:50.485
With the support of William of Scotland troops

18:50.615 --> 18:53.606
and with the help of troops of Britain,

18:54.555 --> 18:55.616
my father will surrender.

18:57.526 --> 19:00.496
Tell me something, brother, when our father surrendered?

19:01.597 --> 19:05.465
When they fought against their mother or perhaps in Toulouse?

19:05.595 --> 19:08.606
He did not even hesitate to send his son to jail?

19:08.636 --> 19:10.606
It was an old deal with the king.

19:10.636 --> 19:13.506
These are old contracts that we have to overcome.

19:13.546 --> 19:14.567
Have you considered that?

19:16.547 --> 19:18.516
You will be able to confront him?

19:19.476 --> 19:22.537
-Our Mother gave us alliances. -our Mother is not here!

19:22.616 --> 19:24.547
For all we know, you may have already fled.

19:26.457 --> 19:28.628
You, the firstborn, was always left out

19:28.657 --> 19:30.587
because Daddy loves Ricardo.

19:31.596 --> 19:34.496
Does all this is not because they are wanting attention?

19:34.526 --> 19:35.587
We discuss this later!

19:36.526 --> 19:37.587
No no no...

19:38.467 --> 19:40.597
Because? We are family here!

19:42.507 --> 19:45.477
We can not have secrets between us.

19:48.547 --> 19:49.527
Your Majesty,

19:50.477 --> 19:53.538
all we ask is that we can receive our mother when she arrives.

19:54.448 --> 19:56.547
we will listen and then make a decision.

19:56.587 --> 19:59.518
I've made my decision.

20:05.628 --> 20:07.528
When his mother comes,

20:08.568 --> 20:12.559
we will decide the smallest details.

20:13.638 --> 20:18.538
Until then, relax and have fun.

20:19.538 --> 20:21.529
Soon feel miss those luxuries.

20:22.549 --> 20:27.568
Life on the battlefield is not easy.

20:57.580 --> 21:00.480
Nunca, nunca mais me question.

21:01.450 --> 21:04.480
Do not you dare come up to me because of its flaws!

21:08.530 --> 21:10.590
The truth is that you have accepted the fact that three castles

21:10.630 --> 21:12.491
They were given to our brother John.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.530
I still remember the treats that our mother has always denied me,

21:16.570 --> 21:19.470
but it was completely beside you and all your love.

21:20.500 --> 21:24.500
This act of rebellion is a problem between you and the king. Understood?

21:24.581 --> 21:25.510
So...

21:25.680 --> 21:27.511
You're against us?

21:30.612 --> 21:33.580
You promise me that his troops will leave the churches,

21:33.620 --> 21:35.650
abbeys and monasteries intact,

21:35.691 --> 21:39.491
as well as all the little chapels you meet along the way?

21:40.490 --> 21:42.581
Will be my booty when the rebellion is over.

21:42.692 --> 21:45.631
-But Counteract God. -On the contrary...

21:46.632 --> 21:49.501
I'm doing a favor to free him of all that gold

21:49.571 --> 21:50.591
weighing on his conscience.

21:54.512 --> 21:56.601
It's not cheap to be a Seneschal in Paris lately.

22:41.693 --> 22:42.653
Ricardo!

22:44.663 --> 22:46.593
Ricardo! Sounds! Sounds!

22:49.663 --> 22:51.604
Brother, what they did to you?

22:51.634 --> 22:53.504
Stop! Get away!

22:53.634 --> 22:54.653
Richard! Richard!

22:55.573 --> 22:58.564
Ricardo! Ended! Ricardo! Ricardo!

22:59.644 --> 23:01.474
Ended! Ended!

23:02.514 --> 23:05.444
It never ends. I am doomed.

23:05.584 --> 23:06.585
Ricardo...

23:06.614 --> 23:08.515
Ended.

23:08.554 --> 23:09.503
What was?

23:15.554 --> 23:16.524
Road.

23:17.624 --> 23:18.615
What happened?

23:19.595 --> 23:21.425
Our mother was captured on his way here.

23:23.633 --> 23:25.563
But no one knew of her arrival.

23:28.504 --> 23:29.624
Obviously, many people knew.

23:40.685 --> 23:44.625
Your Majesty, the armies assembled by their children

23:44.655 --> 23:46.525
in outnumber.

23:46.656 --> 23:49.655
We need all the troops from England to beat them.

23:49.694 --> 23:50.645
Really?

23:51.495 --> 23:53.656
Well, a king is always ready.

23:54.495 --> 23:55.636
Even against his own family?

23:55.666 --> 23:58.536
Especially against his own blood.

24:01.536 --> 24:02.506
Proceed.

24:22.526 --> 24:25.557
You think this is enough to win a war?

24:33.537 --> 24:35.507
I ask God for forgiveness.

24:35.676 --> 24:40.437
I'm here in exile in the land of France.

24:49.557 --> 24:52.577
There are only two reasons to waste your precious time as well.

24:55.558 --> 24:57.498
Or are writing about love ...

24:58.626 --> 24:59.658
or politics.

25:00.627 --> 25:02.528
What do you want exactly?

25:03.597 --> 25:07.438
King Louis called some men of Normandy to help us.

25:08.579 --> 25:11.437
I do not trust them. Why help us?

25:12.478 --> 25:13.607
To confront our common enemy.

25:14.577 --> 25:15.568
An English?

25:15.648 --> 25:16.618
The king of the English.

25:17.549 --> 25:18.618
So what are we?

25:18.648 --> 25:22.488
We are men who want to start the throne of his ass.

25:22.659 --> 25:25.518
Just because we want to put it under our.

25:34.498 --> 25:35.429
Whose is it?

25:36.538 --> 25:38.559
William of Scotland approved our initiative

25:39.609 --> 25:43.509
and are volunteering to create problems for our father.

25:43.639 --> 25:45.508
Will send northern armies.

25:47.479 --> 25:49.549
When the rebellion is over, they will ask ...

25:49.579 --> 25:52.590
Let us put aside any claim Scottish territory?

25:52.619 --> 25:53.649
Impossible! Our father...

25:53.689 --> 25:56.589
Our father is chained in a ditch,

25:56.689 --> 25:59.690
It is assaulted by a torturer who put in his hands

25:59.730 --> 26:01.560
a good looking pen with this

26:01.630 --> 26:04.560
and force you to sign your complete surrender!

26:07.599 --> 26:10.470
Because that's what rebels do with the losers.

26:11.540 --> 26:13.530
They force them to make unfair choices.

26:15.580 --> 26:17.481
It will not come to that.

26:17.511 --> 26:19.481
When our father understand the situation ...

26:19.511 --> 26:21.571
It will come upon us with more violence yet!

26:22.580 --> 26:23.609
Henry, pay attention ...

26:25.520 --> 26:27.581
You still have time to stop all this.

26:28.621 --> 26:30.451
I never wanted this.

26:31.491 --> 26:32.482
It's no secret.

26:32.662 --> 26:34.590
But if you want to go this route

26:35.530 --> 26:38.620
will have to accept the consequences. You will be the king.

26:48.541 --> 26:49.530
So the deal is done.

26:53.611 --> 26:54.581
Yes this.

26:55.622 --> 27:00.421
I tell the news to our important ally?

27:02.622 --> 27:06.461
At the end of this rebellion, the fate of Scotland will be ...

27:07.532 --> 27:08.522
in his hands.

27:54.543 --> 27:57.513
Here it is. I have done as you like.

27:58.653 --> 27:59.613
Thank you.

28:00.553 --> 28:05.424
It is a remedy that an old friend taught me long ago.

28:06.494 --> 28:08.454
It seems that happened in another life.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.494
-What's your name? -marie.

28:13.633 --> 28:14.593
Marie.

28:19.634 --> 28:22.533
Marie, would you mind helping me get on my back?

28:23.544 --> 28:26.404
It is rather difficult to do it alone.

28:26.475 --> 28:27.413
Clear.

28:28.584 --> 28:29.564
Thank you.

28:38.524 --> 28:39.494
Marie?

28:39.655 --> 28:41.555
Why did you pray for me?

28:44.465 --> 28:46.556
Because the church is our only salvation.

28:48.606 --> 28:50.505
Our churches were closed.

28:50.665 --> 28:53.605
They said it was to cover the costs of the rebellion.

28:55.575 --> 28:56.565
Where did you hear that?

28:57.506 --> 28:58.495
Rumors.

28:59.576 --> 29:00.566
You attacked our temples.

29:02.616 --> 29:04.515
I wanted none of it.

29:05.485 --> 29:06.455
Eu...

29:08.485 --> 29:09.476
I'm not well.

29:12.457 --> 29:14.586
God shows us the way through the redemption.

29:16.496 --> 29:17.556
There is no redemption for me.

29:19.496 --> 29:22.466
A long time I did not feel the touch of a woman.

29:23.466 --> 29:26.467
I had forgotten the pleasure of a simple gesture.

29:30.507 --> 29:31.476
What are you doing?

29:32.517 --> 29:34.447
Part of my prayers.

29:47.496 --> 29:49.556
Will protect the sanctity of the church?

30:44.648 --> 30:47.489
You are one of the few men that has not changed

30:47.558 --> 30:48.620
since I met him personally.

30:49.529 --> 30:51.649
Levante, my shining knight.

30:52.529 --> 30:53.548
I am a prisoner.

30:53.659 --> 30:55.599
I do not deserve your reverence.

30:55.699 --> 30:59.639
You will always be my queen. My respect is genuine.

31:01.570 --> 31:02.539
Good...

31:03.640 --> 31:07.679
you should have remembered that when kidnapped me

31:07.709 --> 31:09.539
and killed my followers.

31:11.550 --> 31:15.510
I heard you recommended a warrior.

31:15.621 --> 31:17.450
It is to protect the castle?

31:18.660 --> 31:21.620
The castle ruins can easily survive a siege.

31:21.690 --> 31:26.531
It is not far from the court. Will not resist to my arrival.

31:28.571 --> 31:31.500
Will get us without discussion.

31:38.540 --> 31:39.601
King's orders?

31:41.712 --> 31:43.512
I am leaving?

31:43.711 --> 31:45.540
Yes, it goes away.

31:46.622 --> 31:47.610
Where I go?

31:48.551 --> 31:49.610
To a castle in England

31:50.721 --> 31:54.522
where do you can never leave.

32:15.552 --> 32:17.451
Brother, everything will come out as planned.

32:17.582 --> 32:19.653
With their help, we will cut the troops of our father

32:19.683 --> 32:22.452
and attack from both sides. There is no hope for him.

32:25.592 --> 32:26.563
Do you really think so?

32:26.622 --> 32:29.622
It will be different. The alternative would be lost.

32:31.562 --> 32:33.532
And this king?

32:34.702 --> 32:37.533
I'm sure he has his means, but we can trust him.

32:39.704 --> 32:40.633
Do not know...

32:48.684 --> 32:49.673
Brother, look around you.

32:51.713 --> 32:56.522
Every man in this alliance works day and night for you.

32:56.723 --> 32:59.693
Providing food, shelter, labor ...

33:00.663 --> 33:03.594
Forged weapons with the best steel in France.

33:05.464 --> 33:08.455
You are also fighting for them and they will thank you for it.

33:08.674 --> 33:12.574
From that day everything will change and will become ...

33:12.604 --> 33:14.634
Parents death.

33:17.474 --> 33:20.644
But with the death will have a second birth through the victory!

33:21.615 --> 33:22.603
A much better tomorrow!

33:27.624 --> 33:28.585
Brother.

34:00.585 --> 34:01.556
Now ...

34:02.496 --> 34:05.486
It just depends on win an honorable victory.

34:05.625 --> 34:10.496
Then we can be friends and celebrate together.

34:10.636 --> 34:13.496
Thank you, Your Majesty. We are honored.

34:14.536 --> 34:17.525
We show worthy through our actions, intentions ...

34:17.676 --> 34:19.465
and victories.

34:22.476 --> 34:23.447
Only...

34:23.576 --> 34:24.607
one last request.

34:25.585 --> 34:26.547
Continue.

34:27.516 --> 34:31.505
Ever seen in one place can become when there is no faith.

34:31.656 --> 34:36.556
Ask your guarantee in writing, sealed and sealed with the royal emblem,

34:36.596 --> 34:39.627
that no church, monastery or chapel

34:39.667 --> 34:41.527
will be played by our hosts.

34:42.697 --> 34:47.606
How can a king refuse a request so noble?

34:49.577 --> 34:51.597
You will have your paperwork when they leave.

34:52.678 --> 34:55.547
It is a promise and a duty.

35:09.558 --> 35:12.458
What wind blows in my direction?

35:13.527 --> 35:18.498
My curses of course were in vain since you're here.

35:18.538 --> 35:21.599
King's greetings and on our part, for their hospitality.

35:30.549 --> 35:34.650
With all that said, I receive, knight of the Knights

35:35.689 --> 35:38.619
and I wish you the best on your way.

35:40.528 --> 35:42.518
When the king asks for something ...

35:43.699 --> 35:45.459
it is pleasant.

35:46.569 --> 35:47.529
Or...

35:47.668 --> 35:49.459
Or he orders.

35:57.709 --> 36:02.579
The king must order his men back to England.

36:05.620 --> 36:07.519
The king did not want to hurt you.

36:09.519 --> 36:11.519
But if forced to do so ...

36:11.559 --> 36:15.480
You would end the siege against a true ally?

36:35.580 --> 36:41.582
CASTELO DE ROUEN

36:43.621 --> 36:44.651
Open the gate!

37:08.512 --> 37:10.572
I see you know Alys, my niece.

37:12.452 --> 37:13.442
Her father was killed,

37:13.522 --> 37:17.511
so I am pleased to have her as my guest.

37:49.623 --> 37:51.563
Compiegne Forest

37:51.623 --> 37:53.563
DEVIL'S BRIDGE

37:53.594 --> 37:56.534
CASTELO DE ROUEN

37:56.702 --> 38:01.604
CASTELO DE BRIONNE

38:19.554 --> 38:20.524
Good...

38:21.554 --> 38:22.584
We have answers, Captain?

38:23.594 --> 38:26.624
There is nothing besides women, children and old people in the city.

38:27.593 --> 38:29.534
They will surrender without a fight.

38:58.565 --> 39:00.495
The Templar who are in the camp of King Louis

39:00.566 --> 39:01.556
He reached us.

39:02.536 --> 39:05.525
He is convincing all men to leave for the Crusades.

39:05.606 --> 39:06.576
You cross ...

39:07.504 --> 39:11.505
Pure folly! These people do not even know under what realm they live.

39:11.545 --> 39:14.537
Exactly! It is best to choose a "higher" realm.

39:15.517 --> 39:17.506
People are looking for certainty.

39:17.615 --> 39:18.585
Sure?

39:19.516 --> 39:22.656
In fact I am sure I found the true meaning of life!

39:22.686 --> 39:25.487
Stop! It made me spill the wine!

39:25.557 --> 39:29.496
Her younger sister, definitely seems to have the same opinion!

39:29.666 --> 39:31.566
Do you prefer her or me?

39:32.566 --> 39:33.626
It looks like it's my turn!

39:34.667 --> 39:35.636
Highnesses!

39:36.537 --> 39:37.507
Captain ...

39:40.536 --> 39:43.477
Ricardo. What happened to you, right?

39:45.617 --> 39:48.477
I mean, during his arrest.

39:49.546 --> 39:50.537
What really happened?

39:56.627 --> 39:57.588
I'm sorry. I...

40:01.658 --> 40:02.667
O homeland?

40:02.697 --> 40:03.648
What is going on?

40:04.667 --> 40:06.457
What's going on here?

40:06.598 --> 40:08.588
We are here to liberate these people,

40:09.567 --> 40:12.538
not to overwhelm them and steal their treasures!

40:52.719 --> 40:54.709
This is the sword that killed my father?

41:07.629 --> 41:11.500
My uncle sent me to invite him to the party in honor of the king,

41:11.629 --> 41:13.500
before the siege begins.

41:14.641 --> 41:17.660
The king will not come. He's tired of the trip.

41:19.610 --> 41:20.579
And come?

41:21.680 --> 41:23.610
You will be unhappy if I am?

41:25.650 --> 41:27.550
This will make a difference?

41:31.690 --> 41:33.520
You killed my father.

41:36.690 --> 41:38.590
During um honest duel.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.690
For me there is no difference. He is dead.

41:42.701 --> 41:44.501
I could have been killed.

41:44.701 --> 41:46.671
It would have been better for me.

41:48.741 --> 41:49.711
But not for me.

41:53.741 --> 41:56.711
What pleased you have to kill men?

41:57.682 --> 42:00.582
Taking them from their families? His sons?

42:02.690 --> 42:05.622
That's what I do. And what I have to.

42:05.662 --> 42:06.592
Por quÃª?

42:07.621 --> 42:08.652
I am a knight.

42:10.562 --> 42:11.651
But you seem to like.

42:13.602 --> 42:14.622
I can not do anything else.

42:17.702 --> 42:21.532
Will one day find someone like you,

42:21.702 --> 42:25.503
that will kill him as you did with my father.

42:25.642 --> 42:27.613
I pray the same prayer.

42:28.642 --> 42:29.632
Every day.

42:32.582 --> 42:35.482
My uncle will be glad to have him at his desk.

45:05.607 --> 45:07.637
Father! Father, let me see it!

45:09.647 --> 45:11.478
Whose voice is it?

45:12.517 --> 45:16.478
It Ricardo, ma'am, the son of the king of England.

45:21.629 --> 45:25.458
And the king and he will not come to negotiate?

45:25.628 --> 45:26.617
Where is he?

45:28.628 --> 45:31.498
We raise our flag on top of each city!

45:31.568 --> 45:34.539
They say he is hungry for revenge.

45:35.639 --> 45:36.609
Revenge?

45:37.579 --> 45:39.678
His father arrested and tortured,

45:39.708 --> 45:42.608
just to prove their courage and loyalty.

45:42.678 --> 45:45.508
How long must this madness continue?

45:45.649 --> 45:47.549
What happened to him?

45:47.648 --> 45:49.479
He freed.

45:49.659 --> 45:52.619
He destroyed the fort with his own hands.

45:53.588 --> 45:54.619
You are surrounded ...

45:56.599 --> 45:58.499
No hopes of victory.

45:58.659 --> 46:01.530
You know what people are calling it the Lionheart?

46:01.570 --> 46:06.559
They say he is invincible and is now here with us.

46:07.510 --> 46:11.499
It is surrender and I swear I will not be injured.

46:13.479 --> 46:16.511
It is surrender and be merciful as never seen before.

46:18.549 --> 46:19.540
Lion Heart...

46:27.561 --> 46:28.531
So be it.

46:29.660 --> 46:30.650
No mercy.

46:37.600 --> 46:41.631
The king will leave his quarters at the most opportune time.

46:42.571 --> 46:43.541
But when?

46:44.581 --> 46:45.541
Logo.

46:48.611 --> 46:49.580
When?

46:51.580 --> 46:52.551
Logo.

47:03.562 --> 47:05.552
What do you expect the old lion?

47:06.531 --> 47:08.531
We're spending more than we can plunder.

47:08.571 --> 47:10.531
Every day our provisions are scarce.

47:12.672 --> 47:14.502
We came here.

47:15.611 --> 47:17.471
And now we are in danger of failing.

47:18.581 --> 47:22.601
We will come soon. Rouen will be an easy prey.

47:25.623 --> 47:27.452
We will win.

47:30.692 --> 47:31.622
Overcome.

47:52.583 --> 47:53.553
How is it going?

47:55.553 --> 47:56.543
The castle is strong.

47:57.723 --> 47:58.683
Will resist.

48:00.492 --> 48:01.483
Por how long?

48:03.524 --> 48:04.513
Long enough.

48:05.594 --> 48:07.564
The king must leave immediately.

48:10.663 --> 48:13.633
The king knows. That's why I'm here.

48:15.634 --> 48:17.634
When can I find it?

48:18.643 --> 48:21.504
No one has seen him since you arrived.

48:23.614 --> 48:24.603
The time will come.

48:31.554 --> 48:32.525
Captain,

48:33.624 --> 48:34.645
what's your advice?

48:35.624 --> 48:37.594
My advice would be to look

48:38.565 --> 48:41.564
an alternative solution to an open field attack.

48:41.604 --> 48:44.595
The castle is protected by a solid double wall.

48:45.565 --> 48:46.675
Before you even reach it,

48:46.705 --> 48:49.575
we would have to go through a shower of arrows,

48:49.604 --> 48:52.595
especially here, where this outer wall is considerably lower.

48:54.575 --> 48:56.565
the central area is the second ring

48:56.645 --> 49:00.445
and the only entrance is opposite the passage wall.

49:00.515 --> 49:04.544
There are no windows and the walls have at least one meter thick.

49:05.485 --> 49:09.615
The king, his father, definitely is well protected.

49:10.625 --> 49:12.595
We all know that he would prefer

49:12.636 --> 49:14.626
let them starve to surrender.

49:15.536 --> 49:17.505
How about using the men inside?

49:17.665 --> 49:19.636
Can you buy the captain it? -No.

49:21.606 --> 49:23.596
His name is Wilhelm.

49:24.606 --> 49:26.476
He was on the walls today.

49:26.617 --> 49:28.476
I used to serve him.

49:28.547 --> 49:29.566
It is a firm rider ...

49:30.587 --> 49:32.606
cruel and ruthless.

49:33.555 --> 49:36.547
It exists only to find the man who can beat him.

49:37.556 --> 49:39.616
So far, no one beat him.

49:40.626 --> 49:42.486
Even in chess.

49:45.527 --> 49:48.526
Captain unfortunately Geoffrey was right.

49:48.697 --> 49:51.567
Our supplies are running out fast.

49:52.567 --> 49:54.567
We can not face a long siege ...

49:55.607 --> 49:59.547
therefore, in these circumstances, we must attack now.

50:01.517 --> 50:03.677
Gentlemen, I would like to present some friends

50:04.517 --> 50:06.607
which can be very useful to us.

50:16.568 --> 50:17.547
It is the perfect solution!

50:18.727 --> 50:21.698
See, Captain? We need not worry about anything.

50:52.700 --> 50:54.599
Prepare to attack!

51:19.560 --> 51:20.589
Your friend awaits.

51:20.658 --> 51:24.499
Indeed! This will not be an easy task.

51:34.740 --> 51:37.640
Archers, ready your arrows!

51:46.761 --> 51:48.520
A postos!

51:54.762 --> 51:55.731
Stone!

52:14.651 --> 52:15.621
Stone!

52:26.632 --> 52:27.603
Rebels!

52:29.731 --> 52:30.701
Attack!

53:13.543 --> 53:14.514
Throw!

53:35.565 --> 53:36.504
Archers!

55:39.598 --> 55:40.587
They are massacring us!

55:42.597 --> 55:44.568
As pedras mal arranham
as paredes!

55:46.668 --> 55:48.699
We need to get these archers of the bulwarks

55:49.639 --> 55:51.609
so we can position our stairs.

55:51.709 --> 55:55.578
The stones are too big to take down your archers!

55:58.748 --> 55:59.719
Sort withdrawal!

56:00.619 --> 56:03.589
Send men to safety away from fire arrows.

56:04.489 --> 56:05.480
Nothing further!

56:07.529 --> 56:08.489
Remove!

56:08.688 --> 56:10.519
Remove!

56:10.699 --> 56:13.529
Remove! Remove!

56:30.721 --> 56:31.680
Align!

56:42.560 --> 56:45.621
When you find you, I will tear your fingers!

56:52.600 --> 56:56.511
Stop! Download this stone and do exactly what I say.

56:58.641 --> 57:00.542
What do you have in mind?

57:01.681 --> 57:04.621
What's up, Lionheart?

57:06.621 --> 57:08.652
Hold the line! Hold the line!

57:08.691 --> 57:11.521
Lead your men towards the gates of the castle.

57:11.591 --> 57:12.612
But ... Trust me!

57:12.692 --> 57:15.531
Take your men! Order the attack.

57:15.561 --> 57:17.521
-But ... -Ordene The attack!

57:18.562 --> 57:19.621
Raise your shields!

57:22.571 --> 57:23.562
Attack!

57:31.681 --> 57:32.672
Stone!

57:35.552 --> 57:36.612
What waste of breath!

58:19.694 --> 58:21.594
I hope you know what you're doing, brother.

58:45.625 --> 58:48.555
Your Majesty! The rebels are taking the castle walls!

59:16.586 --> 59:17.575
Open the doors for Henry.

59:27.637 --> 59:28.596
This!

59:33.535 --> 59:34.565
Take it.

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:56.619
Alys! What are you doing here? Let's go!

01:01:13.739 --> 01:01:15.539
Where is my father?

01:01:15.679 --> 01:01:17.650
King never came to Rouen.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:19.710
He is in the north,

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:22.548
taking care of more pressing matters

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:24.579
what their kids capricious.

01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:45.701
Why the rebellion?

01:01:46.571 --> 01:01:49.600
It should be faithful to the man who sent me to die?

01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:53.620
He arrested me for no reason and is now doing the same with my mother!

01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:55.580
Whom no Mai was done.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.691
Another useless war will be won.

01:02:12.702 --> 01:02:14.531
You were betrayed.

01:02:14.602 --> 01:02:17.591
You are a slave to a much greater power than you think.

01:02:18.611 --> 01:02:19.701
-You're lying! -It will be?

01:02:20.642 --> 01:02:21.701
The king wanted you here!

01:02:22.611 --> 01:02:24.601
I was only a means to achieve that goal.

01:02:35.592 --> 01:02:36.682
Ricardo! Pare!

01:02:42.761 --> 01:02:46.672
claim this castle as conquered.

01:02:47.642 --> 01:02:49.693
The castle ... it's all yours.

01:03:15.563 --> 01:03:16.504
What was?

01:03:20.604 --> 01:03:23.573
My brother fought with the British.

01:03:25.674 --> 01:03:27.574
Expected to reach it first, but ...

01:03:28.643 --> 01:03:29.614
He was killed.

01:03:36.584 --> 01:03:37.553
My Lord...

01:03:39.624 --> 01:03:41.684
We are fighting a just war, are not we?

01:03:48.605 --> 01:03:50.594
This rebellion

01:03:51.704 --> 01:03:53.724
You need to bring peace!

01:04:16.626 --> 01:04:18.566
This all makes no sense.

01:04:21.666 --> 01:04:23.656
We are in the wrong place at the wrong time.

01:04:25.606 --> 01:04:28.546
Our father never set foot in the city and our mother is in England,

01:04:28.606 --> 01:04:30.716
-acorrentada. -a Pointless and costly trick.

01:04:30.746 --> 01:04:32.675
Now we all northern France.

01:04:32.715 --> 01:04:34.506
Yes, but at what cost?

01:04:35.686 --> 01:04:37.676
We fall into the trap of our own victory.

01:04:38.617 --> 01:04:42.646
I will write to our father with the terms of his surrender.

01:04:43.757 --> 01:04:44.726
We won!

01:05:13.586 --> 01:05:14.557
A messenger.

01:05:15.587 --> 01:05:16.558
Let him in.

01:05:21.527 --> 01:05:23.668
Your Majesty, I bring the terms of surrender

01:05:23.698 --> 01:05:25.638
that their children require to accept.

01:05:28.667 --> 01:05:30.497
Really?

01:05:31.608 --> 01:05:32.578
Let's take a look.

01:05:36.748 --> 01:05:39.677
Let's see: Unlocking their mother,

01:05:42.587 --> 01:05:43.708
put myself in your hands,

01:05:45.618 --> 01:05:46.648
deliver the throne ...

01:05:48.659 --> 01:05:49.719
It has quite a lot here.

01:05:54.729 --> 01:05:55.768
I know you?

01:05:55.798 --> 01:05:58.559
I am nephew Hugues de Kevelioc.

01:05:59.698 --> 01:06:03.569
Robert! Help me remember his badge ...

01:06:03.709 --> 01:06:06.579
A blue shield with six golden haystacks.

01:06:07.679 --> 01:06:09.609
Sim, claro!

01:06:09.649 --> 01:06:11.639
His uncle has vast lands.

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:14.590
Robert is a very good man.

01:06:14.619 --> 01:06:15.679
And you're just like him?

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.720
Eu tento ser.

01:06:17.759 --> 01:06:21.729
Yes. I believe it is. I can see in his eyes:

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.529
The same pride, loyalty

01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:27.600
and courage.

01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:32.631
-What is your name? -Stewart, Your Majesty.

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.570
Your Majesty...

01:06:34.739 --> 01:06:36.570
Am I still am?

01:06:36.709 --> 01:06:41.640
This letter says I need to give everything I have.

01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:44.580
So who am I but a ...

01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:46.641
Miserable?

01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:50.640
My dear young Stewart,

01:06:51.689 --> 01:06:57.591
Robert nephew of the six golden haystacks ...

01:06:58.631 --> 01:07:00.601
I want to tell you a little secret.

01:07:01.631 --> 01:07:04.600
But not betray my trust.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.631
Not even my children know it.

01:07:10.681 --> 01:07:12.671
No message will get through to them.

01:07:13.712 --> 01:07:18.552
All messages of the "rebels" will be intercepted,

01:07:18.681 --> 01:07:23.682
which means that my arrival in Rouen will be a surprise.

01:07:30.561 --> 01:07:33.552
Yes. Another little secret among kings.

01:07:33.661 --> 01:07:36.632
Louis gave me all the necessary provisions,

01:07:36.673 --> 01:07:39.602
and gave me free passage to Rouen ...

01:07:39.642 --> 01:07:40.603
Majesty ...

01:07:40.643 --> 01:07:44.541
No no no no. Let me make a small suggestion ...

01:07:45.642 --> 01:07:46.582
if I can.

01:07:46.742 --> 01:07:48.682
I trust you, little Stewart,

01:07:49.713 --> 01:07:52.713
and I want to deliver a message for me.

01:08:47.645 --> 01:08:50.514
The King of France tricked us. Completely.

01:08:51.615 --> 01:08:54.674
After the passage of our troops, looted every church, every monastery!

01:08:55.754 --> 01:08:58.615
Not even spared small chapels in the country!

01:08:58.755 --> 01:09:00.585
It did work and so much!

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:03.524
And now...

01:09:04.493 --> 01:09:06.514
we have the troops of the Pope against us as well.

01:09:13.533 --> 01:09:14.505
Me diga, Ricardo...

01:09:16.576 --> 01:09:19.544
Can put this useless pile of metal on the floor?

01:09:20.576 --> 01:09:21.665
You will not get answers from it.

01:09:37.595 --> 01:09:41.526
Someone asked him to step in and make requests to the king?

01:09:43.696 --> 01:09:46.666
A devout lady made me think.

01:09:47.736 --> 01:09:49.676
Would not deny such requests.

01:10:01.687 --> 01:10:03.657
Tell me, brother,

01:10:04.656 --> 01:10:06.627
you happen

01:10:08.557 --> 01:10:13.656
an act accomplished with this pious servant and God-fearing?

01:10:18.737 --> 01:10:20.727
It's the oldest trick in the book, Ricardo!

01:10:23.778 --> 01:10:25.608
I did not stop to think?

01:10:26.707 --> 01:10:29.708
So now the king is getting rich on our backs,

01:10:30.617 --> 01:10:33.717
and in a few weeks we can not even pay our troops

01:10:33.757 --> 01:10:34.708
or buy supplies!

01:10:39.787 --> 01:10:41.618
We need to find a solution.

01:10:42.758 --> 01:10:44.627
What's wrong now?

01:10:56.678 --> 01:10:57.739
There's the father of our response.

01:11:14.699 --> 01:11:17.599
Thanks to the skill of this young maiden,

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.670
the young lions are getting poorer every day,

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:23.599
while my coffers are filling!

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.610
And who is responsible?

01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:36.720
The English, Your Majesty.

01:11:39.689 --> 01:11:40.751
These are the letters of the Pope?

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:46.620
He is furious with the marauding fury of the English?

01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:50.690
As was his will,

01:11:51.701 --> 01:11:52.670
Majesty.

01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:57.641
You tamed the damn lion

01:11:57.741 --> 01:12:01.640
and could force him to do what he wanted.

01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:06.710
If you promise not to use these skills with me ...

01:12:07.751 --> 01:12:12.551
your future is assured!

01:12:39.683 --> 01:12:41.742
Then the trap closes.

01:12:45.752 --> 01:12:47.742
Friends become enemies ...

01:12:52.692 --> 01:12:54.683
Powerful men win ...

01:13:01.602 --> 01:13:03.703
All communications were broken ...

01:13:10.712 --> 01:13:12.613
Rebels are defeated.

01:13:13.682 --> 01:13:16.553
Children will be put back in place.

01:13:55.724 --> 01:13:57.624
-Still Not thanked him ... -Alys.

01:13:57.735 --> 01:13:58.695
Alys.

01:14:00.595 --> 01:14:02.596
-Thank you. We're safe!

01:14:03.735 --> 01:14:06.504
You delivered us, thank you.

01:14:07.705 --> 01:14:11.695
In fact, we fail in our goal.

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:25.616
The castle will not be safe for long.

01:14:29.596 --> 01:14:31.725
I feel more defeated now than at the beginning of the siege.

01:14:37.706 --> 01:14:38.696
Forgive me,

01:14:40.736 --> 01:14:44.646
disturbed his prayers, and it's late.

01:14:46.745 --> 01:14:47.676
Eu sei...

01:14:49.786 --> 01:14:52.546
I know about you and your father.

01:14:54.627 --> 01:14:57.616
And the prison in which he condemned.

01:15:00.597 --> 01:15:03.586
Not exactly a shining example of a family together.

01:15:24.617 --> 01:15:26.586
A father torturing his son.

01:15:29.588 --> 01:15:32.587
Children who struggle against his own father.

01:15:38.668 --> 01:15:41.597
The true nature of things seems to be lost.

01:15:43.668 --> 01:15:47.668
And, in an attempt to solve this, we create chaos.

01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:52.678
Now, we run the risk of being dragged further into the darkness.

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:03.629
My father used to tell me a story.

01:16:05.599 --> 01:16:07.589
I was so proud when he told me.

01:16:10.568 --> 01:16:13.590
He spoke of how in an ancient time,

01:16:14.569 --> 01:16:16.629
when the grace of God was still away from the man.

01:16:17.709 --> 01:16:20.609
Thousands of people were divided into groups

01:16:21.708 --> 01:16:23.579
and for each group

01:16:24.719 --> 01:16:26.709
a man was chosen.

01:16:28.719 --> 01:16:32.710
A man who stood out from his fellow men for their courage,

01:16:33.759 --> 01:16:36.590
loyalty and skill.

01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:41.700
To this man was given a task

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:43.720
and it was honored with the noblest of animals:

01:16:46.641 --> 01:16:47.601
The horse.

01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:51.700
So the first knight was created.

01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:57.710
Being a knight transcends the normal human being.

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:03.690
Opens the door to an ancient world that is often difficult to master.

01:17:05.521 --> 01:17:09.592
It is a fraternity fight that always seeks to bring order

01:17:09.632 --> 01:17:10.581
the chaos of history.

01:17:11.731 --> 01:17:13.532
The higher your honor,

01:17:14.601 --> 01:17:17.690
deeper the abyss where the rider walks on the edge.

01:17:20.571 --> 01:17:22.561
You know what keeps us trapped in this world?

01:17:28.582 --> 01:17:29.551
A espada.

01:17:30.711 --> 01:17:34.621
She constantly reminded of how their way is difficult.

01:17:35.752 --> 01:17:38.652
The more you point a blade to his enemies,

01:17:40.623 --> 01:17:42.622
over the limit will come to you.

01:17:47.632 --> 01:17:48.662
I'm fine, Magdalene.

01:17:49.602 --> 01:17:50.732
You can go to their rooms.

01:17:58.643 --> 01:18:00.673
His father was a wise man.

01:18:03.652 --> 01:18:04.612
Where is him now?

01:18:08.693 --> 01:18:11.593
He was killed by a knight.

01:18:16.534 --> 01:18:17.523
Tell me more about him.

01:18:31.684 --> 01:18:35.513
It's time this silly game ending.

01:18:51.604 --> 01:18:53.693
All wars against his own family

01:18:54.705 --> 01:18:56.564
They are merciless wars.

01:18:59.644 --> 01:19:02.545
Our father troops approach the castle and he'll be surrounded!

01:19:06.644 --> 01:19:08.634
Send two messengers to Paris immediately!

01:19:08.714 --> 01:19:10.485
It's too late!

01:19:10.655 --> 01:19:13.646
King Louis the flags are fluttering beside our father.

01:19:13.724 --> 01:19:15.515
He betrayed us!

01:19:33.606 --> 01:19:34.576
Now ...

01:19:34.675 --> 01:19:36.616
we really are alone.

01:20:04.746 --> 01:20:06.706
Alys! Alys!

01:20:08.717 --> 01:20:09.678
Come on!

01:20:38.778 --> 01:20:40.638
You came to end it all?

01:20:40.747 --> 01:20:42.678
This rebellion ends today.

01:20:43.748 --> 01:20:45.818
You can get this castle back if you want.

01:20:45.848 --> 01:20:48.718
I never cared about that. -Why are you doing this?

01:20:49.819 --> 01:20:52.659
The Seneschal can not be on the losing side.

01:20:56.828 --> 01:20:59.658
How do you sleep at night?

01:21:03.698 --> 01:21:05.599
Um Senescal nunca dorme.

01:21:22.719 --> 01:21:24.590
What's going on here?

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:27.659
Captain! Do not be a fool.

01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:30.689
You served and his princes,

01:21:30.759 --> 01:21:33.600
but it is by their means that I am free.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.729
That's impossible!

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:37.759
Over, captain.

01:21:38.670 --> 01:21:40.570
You've done your job!

01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:43.710
Now take care of their lives!

01:21:44.710 --> 01:21:45.700
Take care of your men!

01:21:47.811 --> 01:21:51.580
Captain, surrender! Save your own life!

01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:57.661
Will not have another chance. The king is here. Your king!

01:22:27.652 --> 01:22:28.622
Henry! Henry!

01:22:29.761 --> 01:22:31.591
Henry! Open the door!

01:22:33.791 --> 01:22:36.632
Ricardo, I brought you here.

01:22:37.631 --> 01:22:38.662
I started his downfall.

01:22:38.802 --> 01:22:40.632
Open the door, Henry!

01:22:41.672 --> 01:22:42.672
Abra a portal

01:22:42.702 --> 01:22:43.691
Go away, Ricardo.

01:22:44.741 --> 01:22:46.712
Let our father dump his anger on me.

01:22:47.672 --> 01:22:48.612
Hi-if.

01:22:48.742 --> 01:22:50.642
I will not let you, Henry!

01:22:50.782 --> 01:22:52.712
I will not let him

01:22:54.713 --> 01:22:55.682
You are my brother!

01:22:56.752 --> 01:22:58.783
Go away. I beg you ...

01:23:00.753 --> 01:23:02.523
like his brother!

01:23:04.692 --> 01:23:06.662
Ricardo, they will kill us! Ricardo!

01:23:08.632 --> 01:23:10.702
We will strive to leave. We have no choice.

01:23:10.732 --> 01:23:14.773
Yes we have! My uncle showed me a passage, it is under the tower!

01:23:14.803 --> 01:23:16.773
I will not leave my men!

01:23:16.813 --> 01:23:18.644
But they will kill me!

01:23:30.653 --> 01:23:35.683
All wins on a child, are victories without hearts.

01:23:44.803 --> 01:23:46.634
This flag! I know her!

01:23:46.774 --> 01:23:49.704
Wilhelm thought it was dead! We are in danger!

01:27:35.771 --> 01:27:37.741
I am the clown this story.

01:27:42.651 --> 01:27:46.741
Closed in the same castle that I won.

01:27:52.692 --> 01:27:54.682
Abandoned by all.

01:28:00.603 --> 01:28:01.562
I'm nothing...

01:28:11.672 --> 01:28:12.612
Nothing.

01:29:40.636 --> 01:29:42.776
ENGLAND SHREWSBURY CASTLE

01:29:42.807 --> 01:29:44.737
6 MONTHS LATER

01:29:49.776 --> 01:29:52.616
Why is mau humor, Ricardo?

01:29:53.646 --> 01:29:56.647
It is the first time we've seen in a long time.

01:29:57.616 --> 01:29:58.677
Since Christmas.

01:29:59.726 --> 01:30:01.746
Remember when fired in that tree?

01:30:04.657 --> 01:30:05.686
How can you be here?

01:30:07.626 --> 01:30:09.617
You are stuck here for over six months.

01:30:10.637 --> 01:30:11.767
We are defeated and soon

01:30:11.808 --> 01:30:13.757
we kneel again before our father!

01:30:14.707 --> 01:30:17.607
I saw the world more times than you,

01:30:18.677 --> 01:30:23.638
and now the change is nothing but a period of time.

01:30:30.717 --> 01:30:33.778
In addition, many battles were won in rooms.

01:30:34.687 --> 01:30:35.658
Mom!

01:30:38.698 --> 01:30:40.627
You think I'm old?

01:30:42.697 --> 01:30:45.688
I've seen the big world.

01:30:47.808 --> 01:30:49.739
Great reis

01:30:51.638 --> 01:30:52.738
and the best warlords.

01:30:57.778 --> 01:30:59.748
They still find me attractive.

01:31:00.788 --> 01:31:02.579
Which reminds me ...

01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:09.628
Someone told me that Alys is very beautiful,

01:31:10.728 --> 01:31:13.599
and it is also the Duchess of Vexin.

01:31:13.799 --> 01:31:15.699
It's a good choice, son.

01:31:20.710 --> 01:31:22.699
His father will command the wedding.

01:31:36.759 --> 01:31:39.619
Look real enough to this farce?

01:31:39.729 --> 01:31:40.710
More than enough.

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.730
Yes, we're coming.

01:31:47.731 --> 01:31:48.759
You are ready for the show?

01:31:50.839 --> 01:31:53.700
Do not forget to give his father his best bow,

01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:57.640
he loves being dramatic!
