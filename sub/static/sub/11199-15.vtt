00:02.049 --> 00:03.209
<i>How about Monday morning?</i>

00:03.283 --> 00:06.116
No, I have a thing
with someone from CIA.

00:07.120 --> 00:09.054
Johnson someone or other.

00:09.122 --> 00:12.558
<i>- It's about that whole Kinsey thing.
- Any big plans for the weekend?</i>

00:12.626 --> 00:15.561
Oh, yeah. Big. Huge!

00:15.629 --> 00:17.893
<i>- Yeah. Me neither.
- What are you talking about?</i>

00:17.964 --> 00:22.025
<i>I just walked in with a whole handful of
ingredients for my world famous omelet.</i>

00:22.102 --> 00:25.902
- World famous, huh? What's in it?
- Eggs.

00:25.972 --> 00:29.669
<i>I don't think that that
actually qualifies as a recipe.</i>

00:29.743 --> 00:33.338
Oh, don't kid yourself.
There's a secret ingredient.

00:33.413 --> 00:35.472
I can't tell you what it is,
or I'd have to shoot you.

00:35.549 --> 00:37.574
It's beer, isn't it?

00:43.590 --> 00:44.921
Let me call you back.

00:44.991 --> 00:46.253
I knew it.

00:48.261 --> 00:49.853
Hello.

00:49.930 --> 00:53.229
- You're Jack O'Neill.
- Yes.

00:53.300 --> 00:56.394
Here's a better question-
who are you?

00:56.470 --> 00:58.404
It doesn't matter to anyone.

00:58.472 --> 01:01.407
All you need to know is...

01:01.475 --> 01:03.067
you ruined my life.

02:21.321 --> 02:24.779
We should have gotten here earlier,
when the real deals were still available.

02:24.858 --> 02:26.849
Honey, it's 7:00 a.m.

02:28.228 --> 02:32.892
Joe, start there and see if you can find
a lamp that would work in the TV room.

02:35.402 --> 02:37.336
Oh, my Lord, look!

02:37.404 --> 02:40.669
They have those
old English tea tins.

03:10.637 --> 03:13.265
<i>- Security breached.
- They just got corridor C9 open.</i>

03:13.340 --> 03:15.069
All right. Let's go.

03:34.728 --> 03:35.717
Excuse me.

03:37.731 --> 03:39.665
How much?

03:39.733 --> 03:44.432
<i>So there's this fella who walks into
a bar, and he sees an ape sitting there-</i>

03:46.640 --> 03:49.438
Sorry, no. He sees a gorilla.

03:49.509 --> 03:50.874
That's it. Right.

03:50.944 --> 03:54.812
There's this gorilla sitting there
drinking a Coke.

03:56.149 --> 03:59.175
So he says to the bartender...

03:59.252 --> 04:01.618
"Hey, what's with that gorilla
drinking that drink?"

04:02.822 --> 04:05.052
Well, the bartender says, "Yeah.

04:05.792 --> 04:08.352
That ape usually orders a Coke."

04:10.697 --> 04:13.928
I mean, a beer.
He usually orders a beer.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.697
Boss, is it an ape or a gorilla? They're
a completely different species, you know.

04:17.771 --> 04:19.329
It doesn't matter.
The point is-

04:19.406 --> 04:23.206
The point is, Joe,
it's a good thing you can cut hair.

04:24.611 --> 04:26.602
Very good, Fred.

04:26.680 --> 04:29.308
- Are we about done here?
- All set.

04:30.383 --> 04:33.079
Because someone
somewhere out there...

04:33.153 --> 04:36.350
needs themselves a new car,
whether they know it or not.

04:37.357 --> 04:39.985
I feel the power to sell
moving through me today!

04:41.828 --> 04:43.295
Boys, it's been a slice.

04:43.363 --> 04:45.092
- Thanks, Fred.
- See ya, Fred.

04:55.809 --> 04:57.504
Bow down now.

04:57.577 --> 05:00.705
Show your reverence for my son...

05:05.251 --> 05:08.186
the mighty warrior Klorel.

05:09.623 --> 05:12.091
Hail Apophis.

05:30.210 --> 05:33.702
Oh, we are reading the best book
in book club this week.

05:33.780 --> 05:36.010
<i>It's called The Heart of a Woman.</i>

05:36.082 --> 05:39.950
It is such a powerful story.
Oh, every time I think about it, l-

05:40.020 --> 05:44.719
- You want to hear a story?
- Sure. What happened today at the shop?

05:44.791 --> 05:47.692
No, it's not work related.
I have a story.

05:47.761 --> 05:50.525
- What do you mean?
- You know, like in those books you read.

05:50.597 --> 05:52.531
Only different.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.833
Okay, sure.

05:55.769 --> 05:59.500
It's about a team of adventurers
known as SG-1.

06:00.273 --> 06:02.138
They travel to other planets...

06:02.208 --> 06:05.837
through an alien device
known as a Stargate.

06:05.912 --> 06:09.905
Their leader is
the fearless Colonel Jack-

06:09.983 --> 06:12.042
O'Neill, prepare yourself for...

06:14.654 --> 06:16.178
extreme deceleration.

06:17.057 --> 06:18.922
Yeah. Thanks, Teal'c.

06:24.497 --> 06:27.898
You will get to see your home
one last time...

06:28.835 --> 06:30.325
before you...

06:30.403 --> 06:33.065
and everyone on your planet...

06:33.139 --> 06:35.505
are destroyed...

06:35.575 --> 06:40.911
and your kind will disturb
the Goa'uld no more.

06:46.820 --> 06:48.879
So, who are the Goa'uld again?

06:48.955 --> 06:51.185
The bad guys.

06:51.257 --> 06:52.622
And this "Skaara" character?

06:52.692 --> 06:55.559
Yeah, I thought you said
his name was Klorel.

06:55.628 --> 06:58.529
I know it's a little complicated.
Just wait.

06:58.598 --> 07:00.589
I haven't gotten
to the good part yet.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.485
I'm sorry.

07:21.554 --> 07:23.249
That's it?

07:23.323 --> 07:25.951
I think so.
For now, anyways.

07:26.025 --> 07:27.652
What happens to Earth?

07:28.394 --> 07:31.886
I don't know. I mean,
I haven't figured that part out yet.

07:31.965 --> 07:35.594
You gotta finish it, Dad.
You can't just end a story in the middle.

07:35.668 --> 07:37.898
I tell you what-

07:37.971 --> 07:40.906
you get all your chores done,
and I'll finish the story tomorrow.

07:40.974 --> 07:43.169
Chores?
What are we, Amish?

07:44.978 --> 07:48.277
- Andy!
- Go do your homework.

07:53.586 --> 07:55.577
He's gotten so precocious.

07:56.990 --> 07:59.049
You hated it, didn't you?

07:59.125 --> 08:01.593
Well, you know,
I'm not the biggest science-fiction fan.

08:02.295 --> 08:05.025
But, no, no.
It was-

08:05.098 --> 08:09.000
It was just so detailed.
How did you come up with it?

08:10.069 --> 08:13.971
Honestly, I don't know.
It just sort of popped into my head.

08:14.808 --> 08:16.275
That's amazing, really.

08:18.845 --> 08:20.335
What didn't you like about it?

08:21.481 --> 08:23.415
Don't get me wrong.
It was exciting.

08:23.483 --> 08:24.916
It's just that, personally...

08:24.984 --> 08:27.578
I like stories that are more
about interpersonal relations...

08:27.654 --> 08:31.454
and a little less to do
with things blowing up.

08:31.524 --> 08:35.051
A giant fireball in the night sky!

08:39.232 --> 08:40.927
You say these folks
are a military unit?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.366
Yeah, they're part of the US Air Force.

08:43.436 --> 08:45.461
But they travel to other planets.

08:45.538 --> 08:47.028
Through the Stargate.

08:47.207 --> 08:49.334
Which is a time-travel machine.

08:49.409 --> 08:52.776
It's an alien device that
creates a stable wormhole...

08:52.846 --> 08:55.371
allowing instantaneous
travel to other worlds.

08:55.448 --> 08:57.882
- Time has nothing to do with it.
- Boss, a question.

08:59.652 --> 09:02.018
- These Gould-
- Goa'ulds.

09:05.225 --> 09:07.489
Never mind.
The bad guys.

09:07.560 --> 09:10.859
- They've got snakes in their heads?
- Symbiotes, yes.

09:10.930 --> 09:13.023
What about the fellas
with the ones in their bellies?

09:13.199 --> 09:16.657
They're Jaffa. They incubate the symbiotes
until they're ready for implantation.

09:16.736 --> 09:20.194
Now, you see, Joe, that's confusing.

09:20.273 --> 09:22.867
He's right, boss. Why can't there be
just one kind of bad guy?

09:22.942 --> 09:25.934
You know, snake goes in the head,
makes them evil, the end.

09:26.012 --> 09:28.276
- You could call 'em the Snake People.
- Yeah. Snake People is good.

09:28.348 --> 09:31.784
They're not called the Snake People.
They're called the Goa'uld.

09:31.851 --> 09:33.682
And the Jaffa aren't bad guys.

09:33.753 --> 09:37.416
They're enslaved warriors who mistakenly
believe that the Goa'uld are their gods.

09:37.490 --> 09:39.924
And it's not confusing, it's complex!

09:44.631 --> 09:46.690
Edge of my seat the whole time.

09:51.104 --> 09:53.800
<i>United States Air Force.
How may I direct your call?</i>

09:54.807 --> 09:57.605
Hi. I'm trying to
reach one of your officers...

09:57.677 --> 10:01.238
a Colonel Jack O'Neill.

10:01.314 --> 10:02.508
Two L's.

10:02.582 --> 10:05.517
<i>May I have your name, please,
and the nature of your call?</i>

10:05.585 --> 10:07.382
<i>- My name?
- Yes, please.</i>

10:09.355 --> 10:11.289
Right. Right.
Of course.

10:11.357 --> 10:14.121
My name is Joe... Smith.

10:14.193 --> 10:17.492
Listen, I realize Colonel O'Neill
is probably unavailable...

10:17.563 --> 10:20.498
off on some important
mission somewhere, but-

10:20.566 --> 10:22.500
I know this is an odd request.

10:22.568 --> 10:25.969
I don't know if you know
Colonel O'Neill personally, but...

10:26.039 --> 10:27.973
could you describe him to me?

10:28.041 --> 10:33.479
You know, height, weight, shoe size,
sense of humor, that sort of thing.

10:33.546 --> 10:35.878
<i>I really can't do that, sir.</i>

10:35.949 --> 10:37.473
Oh. Of course. Sure.

10:37.550 --> 10:39.484
National security.

10:39.552 --> 10:41.486
Now, am I understanding correctly...

10:41.554 --> 10:47.288
that there really is
a Colonel Jack O'Neill in the air force?

10:47.360 --> 10:50.124
<i>Is there a message you would
like to leave for him, sir?</i>

10:50.196 --> 10:52.061
That's fine. Thank you.

11:01.607 --> 11:03.541
So, in the end...

11:03.609 --> 11:08.546
Rya'c was freed
from Apophis's control.

11:08.614 --> 11:12.550
Teal'c, Drey'auc, and Rya'c
were once again a family.

11:12.618 --> 11:15.416
But Teal'c is still going back
to Stargate Command...

11:15.488 --> 11:18.048
to fight for the freedom of the Jaffa?

11:18.124 --> 11:22.288
Of course. He's going to take Drey'auc and
Rya'c to a place where they'll be safe.

11:22.362 --> 11:25.388
So, the Goa'uld won't put
any more bombs in Rya'c's teeth?

11:25.465 --> 11:27.956
That's right.
Now, go to sleep.

11:31.204 --> 11:32.398
Cool story, Dad.

11:49.155 --> 11:52.215
Joe, where do you get these
ideas you've had lately?

11:53.059 --> 11:54.321
I don't know.

11:54.394 --> 11:58.922
Fully formed ideas, plots, characters-
they just appear in your head?

11:58.998 --> 12:00.556
Basically.

12:05.872 --> 12:08.397
Why are you looking at me like that?

12:08.474 --> 12:12.103
I think you've gotten in touch
with your dormant creativity...

12:12.178 --> 12:15.147
accessed your wellspring
of imagination.

12:15.214 --> 12:16.272
What?

12:16.382 --> 12:18.407
I've read about this happening
to other people.

12:18.484 --> 12:20.850
You're opening yourself up
to your inner muse.

12:21.587 --> 12:22.747
My inner muse?

12:23.790 --> 12:25.348
It's your midlife crisis.

12:25.425 --> 12:26.551
It is?

12:26.626 --> 12:30.084
Except instead of chasing your youth
by buying a sports car...

12:30.163 --> 12:31.596
or going hang-gliding...

12:31.664 --> 12:35.293
you're seeking immortality
through creativity.

12:36.069 --> 12:38.970
- We can't afford a sports car.
- Honey, it's a good thing.

12:39.038 --> 12:42.565
Especially if it means you're not going
to have an affair with a younger woman.

12:47.380 --> 12:52.113
<i>Wait. You said Teal'c put his face up to
that head-grabber thing before O'Neill.</i>

12:52.185 --> 12:53.652
Why didn't he get grabbed first?

12:53.719 --> 12:57.553
Guys, I told you.
Save your questions until I finish.

12:57.623 --> 13:01.650
Now, what was left of
Colonel O'Neill's mind...

13:01.727 --> 13:04.719
managed to dial a gate address...

13:04.797 --> 13:08.392
one they had never dialed before.

13:21.914 --> 13:23.814
The Asgard?

13:23.883 --> 13:25.441
Those little gray guys.
Right.

13:25.518 --> 13:27.509
Shut up and let him finish, Bert.

13:32.125 --> 13:33.558
And...

13:35.061 --> 13:37.188
I don't want to sound ungrateful...

13:37.263 --> 13:41.791
because I really, really appreciate you
getting all that stuff out of my head.

13:45.505 --> 13:48.474
But you folks should understand...

13:50.710 --> 13:53.042
that we're out there now.

13:55.047 --> 13:57.675
We might not be ready
for a lot of this stuff...

13:58.451 --> 14:00.510
but we're doing the best we can.

14:22.608 --> 14:27.341
You have already taken the first steps
towards becoming the fifth race.

14:31.984 --> 14:34.748
What about the Furlings?
Are we ever going to hear about them?

14:34.820 --> 14:37.983
Oh, of course. I'm sure we'll hear
lots of stories about them.

14:41.127 --> 14:44.028
I mean, I'll make one up.

14:45.665 --> 14:48.099
Furlings.
They sound cute.

14:48.167 --> 14:50.158
Like Ewoks.

15:01.447 --> 15:04.041
Andy, finish up, or you're going
to miss your bus, sweetie.

15:04.116 --> 15:05.981
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

15:06.052 --> 15:10.386
I want that lawn done today. It looks like
a wheat field's growing in our backyard.

15:10.456 --> 15:12.390
After school, Mom.
I promise.

15:12.458 --> 15:14.892
Son, you get that lawn finished...

15:14.961 --> 15:17.293
and I'll tell you
all about the Reetou.

15:17.363 --> 15:18.853
Cool!

15:20.766 --> 15:22.757
See you, Mom.
See you, Dad.

15:26.772 --> 15:30.139
- The Reetou?
- Foothold situation at the SGC.

15:31.210 --> 15:32.677
Joe, don't take this the wrong way...

15:32.745 --> 15:35.805
but maybe you should cut back
on the storytelling a bit.

15:36.449 --> 15:38.110
- Why?
- Nothing.

15:38.184 --> 15:41.119
It's just, well, I've heard
a few comments from people in town.

15:41.187 --> 15:42.449
People? What people?

15:42.521 --> 15:46.082
Not everyone wants to hear
aboutJack O'Neill and SG-1...

15:46.158 --> 15:48.092
every time they come in for a haircut.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.889
They like hearing my stories.

15:50.529 --> 15:54.226
Maybe they're just being polite, dear.
And it's not just at the shop.

15:55.034 --> 15:58.197
Sam at the drugstore said you talk
his ear off every time you're there...

15:58.271 --> 16:01.297
and Marjory at the bank,
and Lenny at the gas station.

16:01.374 --> 16:04.400
Charlene, you were the one
who told me to follow my muse.

16:04.477 --> 16:05.910
Now you want me to stop?

16:05.978 --> 16:09.243
What if you write them down?

16:09.315 --> 16:11.112
You mean, like a... writer?

16:11.884 --> 16:13.181
Put them on paper.

16:13.252 --> 16:15.720
You can have them there in the shop,
like the magazines.

16:15.788 --> 16:18.814
That way, if people
want to read them, they can.

16:36.942 --> 16:40.070
Sir, the timing has to be exact.
Just a few more seconds.

16:40.146 --> 16:43.172
It's going to have
to be close enough. Go!

16:53.993 --> 16:59.056
Young Lieutenant Hammond...

16:59.131 --> 17:02.157
faced a tough decision.

17:02.234 --> 17:05.567
Yet the strange foursome...

17:05.638 --> 17:09.540
hardly seemed like Soviet spies.

17:09.608 --> 17:12.236
Honey, it's 3:00 in the morning.
Come to bed.

17:12.311 --> 17:14.711
Just let me finish this story.

17:14.780 --> 17:18.807
You said that last night and the night
before. You've got to get up in 4 hours.

17:18.884 --> 17:22.376
How are you going to cut people's hair
if you're dead on your feet all day?

17:25.758 --> 17:27.248
In a minute.

17:42.742 --> 17:46.439
<i>They embraced, and he looked
into her eyes one last time.</i>

17:47.313 --> 17:49.747
<i>He walked away
with sadness in his heart...</i>

17:49.815 --> 17:53.410
<i>and she watched him go, wondering
if she would ever see him again.</i>

17:53.486 --> 17:56.250
<i>- The end.
- That poor woman.</i>

17:57.490 --> 17:59.253
Do you think...

17:59.325 --> 18:01.759
she was with child?

18:01.827 --> 18:05.126
You'll just have to
wait until the sequel.

18:05.197 --> 18:08.360
- You've got to be kidding me.
- I got something in my eye.

18:08.434 --> 18:11.130
Oh, you're such a softy.

18:13.072 --> 18:14.699
See you tonight, honey.

18:14.774 --> 18:16.571
- Bye.
- Bye, Cindy.

18:20.913 --> 18:22.403
- Morning, boys.
- Hey, Calvin.

18:22.481 --> 18:26.247
Joe, looks like you got some letters
from those magazines in New York.

18:38.864 --> 18:41.731
"Thank you for your submission.

18:41.801 --> 18:43.234
Unfortunately"-

18:44.470 --> 18:46.631
"Thank you for your interest.
Best of luck in the future."

18:46.705 --> 18:49.606
See, I'm not sure you should've sent in
this one about Seth.

18:49.675 --> 18:52.303
- It wasn't one of your best.
- They rejected "Hathor?"

18:52.378 --> 18:54.039
But it was gold!

19:03.022 --> 19:04.956
- Dad.
- I'm writing!

19:05.024 --> 19:06.889
Seriously, Dad, you've got to see this.

19:06.959 --> 19:10.725
Prepare for an extreme adventure.

19:10.796 --> 19:12.093
What?

19:12.164 --> 19:14.155
Check it out.

19:20.806 --> 19:25.937
Four excellent heroes...
in an extraordinary new sci-fi series...

19:26.011 --> 19:29.447
starring Nick Marlowe
as the wry Colonel Danning.

19:29.515 --> 19:32.609
<i>As a matter of fact,
it does say "Colonel'"on my uniform.</i>

19:34.286 --> 19:37.346
There's no such thing
as original thought anymore.

19:37.423 --> 19:40.881
We're all just regurgitating
the same old ideas over and over again...

19:41.360 --> 19:44.295
boiling them down
to a giant melting pot of mediocrity.

19:44.363 --> 19:47.662
Introducing Douglas Anders
as Grell, the robot.

19:52.238 --> 19:55.230
<i>Wormhole X-treme-
coming this fall.</i>

19:55.307 --> 19:58.299
They stole my idea.

20:01.514 --> 20:04.847
Hey, whatever happened to that lawsuit
you guys had against-

20:04.917 --> 20:07.351
<i>- What was that show called?
- Wormhole X-treme?</i>

20:07.419 --> 20:10.354
Nah, it was canceled
only after one episode.

20:10.422 --> 20:13.016
- Bad ratings.
- I liked it.

20:13.092 --> 20:15.424
Not as much as your stories, boss.

20:16.795 --> 20:20.629
Actually, I have a new one.
Just came to me last night.

20:20.699 --> 20:24.795
SG-1 finds out there's a giant asteroid
headed toward Earth-

20:24.870 --> 20:27.100
I saw the movie.
Hits Paris.

20:27.172 --> 20:29.106
Nah, this is different.

20:29.174 --> 20:31.108
It starts when
this amateur astronomer-

20:31.176 --> 20:35.510
Actually, Joe, if it's all right with you,
I'm not really in the mood.

20:35.581 --> 20:38.914
Oh, come on, now. Don't you
want to know how SG-1 stops it?

20:38.984 --> 20:40.451
Here, I'll just tell you.

20:40.519 --> 20:45.047
Carter is able to expand the hyperspace
window from the ship until it surrounds-

20:45.124 --> 20:49.424
Look, no offense, but how many times can
these folks save the world from Apophis?

20:50.963 --> 20:54.899
- What's it up to now, five, six times?
- This is about Anubis. Apophis is dead.

20:54.967 --> 20:58.368
What's the diff? You know what I'm saying?
It's getting a little repetitive.

20:59.071 --> 21:03.599
I mean, come on now. There must be other
things we can talk about besides SG-1.

21:08.380 --> 21:10.371
You guys play golf?

21:19.725 --> 21:21.716
Joe, I need to talk to you.

21:21.794 --> 21:24.524
- Just a second, honey. I'm in the zone.
- Honey, stop typing.

21:24.597 --> 21:27.191
- Writing.
- Please.

21:27.266 --> 21:28.494
What's up?

21:28.567 --> 21:30.728
I want you to stop.

21:30.803 --> 21:32.862
I just did.

21:32.938 --> 21:35.406
I mean permanently.

21:35.474 --> 21:37.738
- What?
- I've been going over our bills-

21:39.511 --> 21:43.971
You closed the shop early three times
this week to come home and write.

21:44.049 --> 21:47.246
I closed the shop
because business has been slow.

21:47.319 --> 21:49.253
- And you don't see the connection?
- Don't worry.

21:49.321 --> 21:53.348
Once I get a few stories published,
land an agent, things'll get better.

22:00.332 --> 22:03.199
Three hundred and twenty-six.

22:03.268 --> 22:05.702
That's how many rejection letters
you've received.

22:05.771 --> 22:08.205
You only need one "yes."

22:08.273 --> 22:12.107
They're not reading them anymore,
just sending them back unopened.

22:12.177 --> 22:13.542
Bert and Gordie like them.

22:13.612 --> 22:15.705
They work for you.
What else are they going to say?

22:16.448 --> 22:17.847
You haven't even read them all.

22:18.450 --> 22:22.045
I read "Holiday,"
"The Light," "The Sentinel."

22:22.121 --> 22:25.579
Okay, I admit those may have
been a few small missteps.

22:25.658 --> 22:29.150
- But they're getting better, aren't they?
- I don't know.

22:29.228 --> 22:32.925
What do you think the problem is?
Tell me. Maybe I can fix it.

22:32.998 --> 22:36.729
Well, for one, it seems to me
like the team interaction...

22:36.802 --> 22:38.565
isn't what it used to be
in the beginning.

22:39.638 --> 22:42.232
- You hate them all?
- No, I don't.

22:42.307 --> 22:44.468
I hate what this is doing to you.

22:46.211 --> 22:47.906
You really want me to stop?

22:47.980 --> 22:52.610
Joe, how can this really be more
important than your livelihood?

22:52.685 --> 22:53.845
Than your family?

22:55.788 --> 22:58.985
Honestly, Charlene,
I don't think I can stop.

22:59.858 --> 23:01.155
Why not?

23:02.161 --> 23:04.322
These stories...

23:04.396 --> 23:05.886
I think-

23:06.799 --> 23:08.494
Think? You think what?

23:09.368 --> 23:11.199
I think they're real, Charlene.

23:14.740 --> 23:19.074
I'm not making them up.
They're happening somewhere.

23:19.144 --> 23:21.169
I can see them
because of the stone.

23:22.915 --> 23:28.376
I can't explain it. Somehow I think it
allows me to see these incredible things.

23:28.454 --> 23:30.217
That you believe are really happening?

23:30.289 --> 23:31.916
Yes! Here, try it.

23:33.092 --> 23:34.252
Where is it?

23:37.296 --> 23:39.264
Did you take it?

23:39.331 --> 23:41.231
Charlene, what'd you do with it?

23:42.935 --> 23:45.369
Charlene!
What have you done with my stone?

23:48.340 --> 23:50.433
It was for your own good!

23:54.379 --> 23:56.370
Has he totally lost it or what?

23:58.450 --> 24:00.782
Joe, please.
You need help.

24:03.856 --> 24:08.225
Son, if you know where it is, tell me.
I'm not mad. I just need my stone.

24:09.027 --> 24:10.927
- Mom?
- You leave him out of this!

24:12.698 --> 24:15.997
Joe, please!
You're scaring us.

24:32.684 --> 24:33.673
Yes!

24:36.021 --> 24:37.613
Where are you going?

24:38.390 --> 24:39.857
I don't know.

24:59.611 --> 25:01.841
He can't be gone.

25:04.917 --> 25:07.408
He's dead.

25:11.456 --> 25:13.583
Daniel's dead.

25:19.798 --> 25:21.993
He can't be dead.

25:30.776 --> 25:33.040
Gordie,
you're wearing out the floor.

25:35.013 --> 25:37.004
- Calvin.
- Gentlemen.

25:39.351 --> 25:40.579
Slow day?

25:41.687 --> 25:43.177
What have you got, Calvin?

25:44.089 --> 25:48.082
Looks like a stack of bills and a couple
more letters from those magazines.

25:49.328 --> 25:50.818
Toss them.

25:50.896 --> 25:54.855
There's also another letter here
from the air force.

25:56.668 --> 25:57.726
You read it.

26:07.346 --> 26:08.677
"Dear Mr. Spencer...

26:08.747 --> 26:12.774
Regarding your request to meet
with Colonel Jack O'Neill...

26:12.851 --> 26:15.718
we regret to inform you that"-

26:18.090 --> 26:20.854
Hey, Joe...

26:20.926 --> 26:23.360
if you're so sure this is all real...

26:23.428 --> 26:26.022
then why don't you follow it up
with more than just letters?

26:26.098 --> 26:29.693
Call them up. Tell them what you know.
If it really is true-

26:29.768 --> 26:32.259
Are you kidding?
I'd disappear in a heartbeat.

26:33.038 --> 26:34.699
- You think?
- Believe me.

26:34.773 --> 26:39.608
If the government didn't get me,
NI D is sure to. I've seen it happen.

26:39.678 --> 26:41.236
Remember Armin Selig?

26:42.247 --> 26:43.236
Dead.

26:45.284 --> 26:46.581
Right.

26:49.988 --> 26:52.115
Well, look...

26:52.190 --> 26:56.183
I gotta get back to my route now.

26:57.195 --> 26:59.595
- You guys take care.
- Thanks, Calvin.

27:27.893 --> 27:29.383
Hi, Jack.

27:34.366 --> 27:35.458
Daniel.

27:36.168 --> 27:39.160
I leave, and look at the mess
you get yourself into.

27:42.874 --> 27:44.865
Yes!

27:53.885 --> 27:56.945
Charlene! Charlene,
you won't believe it.

27:58.623 --> 28:03.117
Oh, there you are. Honey, it's incredible.
Daniel's still alive.

28:03.195 --> 28:07.154
I mean, I know he ascended
to a higher plane of existence, but he-

28:07.232 --> 28:08.529
What are you doing?

28:08.600 --> 28:10.966
Andy and I are going
to my mother's for a while.

28:11.036 --> 28:14.665
If you have even the slightest interest
in saving our marriage...

28:14.740 --> 28:16.207
you'll see someone who can help you.

28:16.274 --> 28:18.708
I don't need a shrink.

28:19.578 --> 28:23.378
Honey, don't do this.
Please.

28:23.448 --> 28:26.349
Come on! Honey!

28:26.418 --> 28:28.750
Come on.
We can work things out.

28:28.820 --> 28:31.948
Charlene, look,
our problems are small compared-

28:33.592 --> 28:35.526
Wait, just- Let's talk.

28:35.594 --> 28:39.257
- Can we just talk this out?
- Good-bye, Joe. I'll call you later.

28:43.168 --> 28:45.398
Wait!
Charlene!

28:53.945 --> 28:55.606
<i>Dear Colonel O'Neill...</i>

28:55.680 --> 28:57.614
<i>I understand
you are a very busy man.</i>

28:57.682 --> 29:00.617
<i>However, I must wonder
if you are actually getting...</i>

29:00.685 --> 29:03.552
<i>each and every piece
of correspondence I send you.</i>

29:03.622 --> 29:07.558
<i>I have written many letters and left
countless messages with the air force...</i>

29:07.626 --> 29:10.959
<i>but I have yet to receive
any kind of response from you.</i>

29:12.864 --> 29:17.096
<i>Because of this, I have no choice
but to take my life into my own hands...</i>

29:17.169 --> 29:18.898
<i>and come clean with you.</i>

29:18.970 --> 29:20.460
I know everything.

29:23.241 --> 29:27.075
- Geez, you scared the hell out of me.
- I'm sorry.

29:27.145 --> 29:30.137
It's okay, Gordie.
I'm just glad it's you.

29:31.249 --> 29:34.377
Boss, if it's all right with you,
me and Bert are going to head home.

29:34.453 --> 29:35.943
It looks like nobody's
coming in again today.

29:36.621 --> 29:37.952
Yeah.

29:38.023 --> 29:42.619
Look, I know this is
kind of a bad time, but-

29:46.631 --> 29:47.791
What is it?

29:48.500 --> 29:52.027
Well, it's been really slow
around here, and...

29:52.104 --> 29:55.767
I kind of dropped off an application
at the Piggly Wiggly.

29:57.976 --> 29:59.967
I understand.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

30:01.179 --> 30:03.477
Thanks, boss.
Good night.

30:04.749 --> 30:06.444
Night.

30:39.351 --> 30:41.342
<i>Activating hyperdrive!</i>

30:44.122 --> 30:45.783
Standing straight up.

30:53.198 --> 30:56.497
<i>Come on, boys!
Have at 'em!</i>

31:16.888 --> 31:18.014
Sir!

31:43.915 --> 31:46.577
Thanks for seeing me.
You look great.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.982
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm good.

31:51.056 --> 31:52.853
- Very good.
- Good.

31:57.996 --> 32:00.430
I'm sorry about everything
that's happened.

32:00.498 --> 32:03.592
I drove you and Andy away.
I understand that now.

32:03.668 --> 32:05.602
- Joe-
- Just let me finish.

32:05.670 --> 32:09.538
I was too wrapped up in the stories
to realize what was important.

32:09.608 --> 32:14.136
I promise I will focus on rebuilding my
business, on providing for my family...

32:14.212 --> 32:16.476
if you'll give me another chance.

32:16.548 --> 32:18.641
It was never about the money, Joe.

32:18.717 --> 32:20.708
It was your obsession with that stone.

32:20.785 --> 32:23.720
I know, I know,
and I owe you both an explanation.

32:23.788 --> 32:26.655
That's why I brought you proof
that my visions are real.

32:27.225 --> 32:29.921
This is whatJack O'Neill
actually looks like.

32:29.995 --> 32:33.260
I know what you're thinking,
but I swear I saw this image in my mind...

32:33.331 --> 32:34.764
long before it was in the paper.

32:35.634 --> 32:40.628
And here. This report about massive
solar flare activity from six years ago.

32:40.705 --> 32:44.641
It coincides with the time
SG-1 destroyed Apophis's fleet.

32:44.709 --> 32:48.145
And this, about the sinking
of a Russian submarine?

32:48.213 --> 32:53.378
It happened the same time Anubis's ship
crashed into the Pacific Ocean.

32:53.451 --> 32:56.579
It just means that you're using
real people and events...

32:56.655 --> 32:58.589
and incorporating them
in your fantasies.

32:58.657 --> 33:01.820
They're not fantasies.
Jack O'Neill is head of Stargate Command.

33:01.893 --> 33:03.588
There is no Stargate Command!

33:06.998 --> 33:11.025
Listen to me. I've been talking to
several doctors about your symptoms.

33:11.102 --> 33:16.301
They think that you might be suffering
from something called manic psychosis...

33:16.374 --> 33:18.638
combined with grandiose delusions.

33:18.710 --> 33:21.770
But with therapy and medication...

33:21.846 --> 33:25.213
you could probably live a normal life.

33:25.283 --> 33:27.376
Oh, my God.

33:27.452 --> 33:31.513
They're fighting in Antarctica
for Earth's very survival.

33:38.530 --> 33:41.021
Anubis's fleet
is in orbit above us right now.

33:41.099 --> 33:43.067
Joe, stop it.
It's not real.

33:43.134 --> 33:44.567
You don't understand!

33:44.636 --> 33:47.867
If Jack can't find a way to use
the Ancients' technology in time...

33:47.939 --> 33:49.031
we're all dead!

33:49.774 --> 33:51.935
Good-bye, Joe.

33:52.010 --> 33:54.672
It's happening, Charlene!

33:54.746 --> 33:57.374
You'll see!
It's real!

34:40.992 --> 34:42.254
<i>Okay, look.</i>

34:42.327 --> 34:45.626
This obviously isn't your forte.

34:45.697 --> 34:49.428
So why don't you just put the gun down
before you get hurt.

34:49.501 --> 34:51.401
Don't come any closer.

34:51.469 --> 34:53.733
I know your gun isn't real.

34:54.839 --> 34:56.807
However, mine is.

34:56.875 --> 35:01.209
Oh, God! I'm sorry. You're right.
It's just a toy. Please don't shoot me.

35:01.279 --> 35:04.043
- I'm not going to shoot you.
- I'm sorry.

35:04.115 --> 35:07.380
I just thought it was the only way
to make you listen to me.

35:07.452 --> 35:11.752
Oh, where you're going
people will listen.

35:11.823 --> 35:14.485
They've got nothing to do
but listen to what you have to say.

35:14.559 --> 35:17.323
They've got nice white coats,
padded walls, the whole nine yards.

35:17.395 --> 35:18.885
Please wait.

35:18.963 --> 35:21.090
You're Brigadier General
Jack O'Neill...

35:22.000 --> 35:25.629
head of Stargate Command
at Cheyenne Mountain.

35:25.703 --> 35:31.232
You used to command SG-1, which is now
led by Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter.

35:31.309 --> 35:33.743
You once visited a planet called Argos...

35:33.812 --> 35:37.179
and the nanites in your blood
caused you to age artificially.

35:37.248 --> 35:40.684
You've had the entire repository
of the Ancients' knowledge...

35:40.752 --> 35:43.312
downloaded into your brain twice.

35:43.388 --> 35:46.516
<i>You have a thing
for The Simpsons, fishing...</i>

35:46.591 --> 35:48.786
Mary Steenburgen,
the color peridot...

35:48.860 --> 35:51.328
and you're a terrible Ping-Pong player.

35:51.396 --> 35:54.957
- Have we met?
- My name is Joe Spencer. I'm a barber.

35:56.234 --> 35:57.531
It's all true, isn't it?

35:57.602 --> 35:59.297
Everything I've seen-

35:59.370 --> 36:04.000
the Stargate, the Goa'uld,
the Asgards.

36:04.075 --> 36:05.303
It's all real.

36:05.376 --> 36:08.504
Tell me it's real.
I need to know.

36:10.582 --> 36:13.278
Well, first of all, Joe...

36:13.351 --> 36:16.115
I'm not a terrible
Ping-Pong player.

36:25.964 --> 36:29.127
Between you and me,
I totally see the analogy.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.794
Burns as Goa'uld.

36:31.870 --> 36:34.100
- Thank you.
- And don't worry.

36:34.172 --> 36:37.539
I won't say a word
about your feelings for-

36:40.311 --> 36:41.903
This is such an honor.

36:41.980 --> 36:46.280
I don't know how to thank you
for all you've done for our planet.

36:46.351 --> 36:47.682
There are not enough words.

36:47.752 --> 36:49.879
It's nice to meet you too.

36:49.954 --> 36:51.649
Joe Spencer.

36:51.723 --> 36:54.749
I was particularly impressed
with the time you blew up that sun.

36:55.560 --> 36:57.721
Well, thank you.
I had a bit of help.

36:57.795 --> 37:00.821
And as far as this whole
Pete Shanahan thing goes-

37:01.933 --> 37:05.391
Dr. Jackson, can I just say
thank goodness you're back?

37:05.470 --> 37:06.937
Not thatJonas was a bad guy...

37:07.005 --> 37:10.497
but after all you've been through
together, you belong here with SG-1.

37:10.575 --> 37:12.008
Thank you.
Jack?

37:12.977 --> 37:15.172
He's a barber.

37:15.813 --> 37:17.906
- Broke into your house?
- Yeah.

37:17.982 --> 37:19.711
Second week in a row.

37:21.185 --> 37:24.518
- Alarm.
- I'm thinking dog.

37:24.589 --> 37:27.183
You could try
locking your front door.

37:44.542 --> 37:47.170
Joe, the barber.

37:47.245 --> 37:48.769
Please be seated.

37:50.748 --> 37:52.682
What have you got there, Carter?

37:52.750 --> 37:56.242
Initial tests show thatJoe possesses
the same Ancient gene as you do.

37:56.321 --> 37:59.051
I just want you to know
if you ever need me...

37:59.123 --> 38:02.456
to use the chair device in Antarctica
in defense of the planet, I'm there.

38:02.527 --> 38:03.721
Thank you.

38:08.399 --> 38:12.460
Other than that,
his physiology is completely normal.

38:12.537 --> 38:14.471
Do not a great many people
possess this Ancient gene?

38:14.539 --> 38:17.167
Yeah, I mean, how come
I'm the only one seeing these things?

38:17.241 --> 38:19.732
Yes. Good question.
Pray tell.

38:19.811 --> 38:22.837
Unfortunately, our knowledge
of Ancient physiology is fairly limited.

38:23.681 --> 38:25.046
The only other thing we know is...

38:25.116 --> 38:27.778
Joe has somehow managed
to gain access to huge amounts...

38:27.852 --> 38:31.083
of classified information,
mainly in regard to SG-1...

38:31.155 --> 38:34.591
and that these visions are somehow
connected to the stone he found.

38:34.659 --> 38:36.149
Anything on that?

38:37.128 --> 38:39.961
Daniel's looking into it. He did say
there was something familiar about it.

38:40.031 --> 38:44.229
You claim to receive these visions
only within the proximity of the stone.

38:44.302 --> 38:48.238
Perhaps there is a connection between the
stone and your genetic predispositions.

38:48.306 --> 38:53.334
The hair makes you look different, but
didn't you use to be more gold-colored?

38:54.545 --> 38:56.012
I think I've got it.

38:57.081 --> 38:59.549
It took me a while
to track it down, but-

39:01.019 --> 39:03.419
- You have one too?
- Think they're a set.

39:03.488 --> 39:05.979
Jack, you remember P3R-233?
The planet where l-

39:06.057 --> 39:08.753
Where you found the quantum mirror
that sent you to an alternate reality...

39:08.826 --> 39:10.623
where the Goa'uld invaded Earth.

39:17.402 --> 39:19.666
- Hey, fella.
- Hi, Jack.

39:19.737 --> 39:23.002
- This all the stuff we brought back from-
- P3R-233? Yeah.

39:23.074 --> 39:24.837
Came down to help me catalog it?

39:24.909 --> 39:27.173
You bet. My favorite.

39:27.245 --> 39:29.679
But it's all going to have to wait.

39:29.747 --> 39:31.681
Hammond called a briefing.

39:31.749 --> 39:34.183
We got some intel back...

39:34.252 --> 39:38.313
indicating that Apophis
might not be so dead as we thought.

39:40.992 --> 39:42.983
Something about...

39:44.529 --> 39:46.463
Chulak.

39:46.531 --> 39:49.466
I think the stones were a kind of Ancient
long-range communication device...

39:49.534 --> 39:53.061
allowing people to see events over great
distances through some psychic connection.

39:53.137 --> 39:55.401
Jack must have activated the link between
the stones by picking up the second stone.

39:56.507 --> 39:59.067
After that,
all that would be required...

39:59.143 --> 40:01.077
is a certain proximity to the stone
for the connection to be activated.

40:01.145 --> 40:03.670
Seeing as how the stone
was being stored in the base archives-

40:03.748 --> 40:07.844
But that doesn't explain how
the other stone got to the-Where was it?

40:07.919 --> 40:09.284
A garage sale.

40:10.588 --> 40:15.582
The person who sold it to me said his
grandfather found it on a dig in Egypt.

40:15.660 --> 40:17.958
But that still doesn't explain
the proximity issue.

40:18.029 --> 40:21.260
If the stone General O'Neill
touched was kept here...

40:21.332 --> 40:23.800
how was Joe able to see everything
that happened to the general off-world?

40:23.868 --> 40:27.861
He was getting most of it from when Jack
was writing his reports here on the base.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.735
The stone was being stored
just a few levels above.

40:30.808 --> 40:33.242
That's why the stories
were so easy to write.

40:33.311 --> 40:37.441
It was like someone else
had done most of the work for me.

40:37.515 --> 40:40.450
And you say they all got rejected?

40:43.287 --> 40:44.549
Wait a second.

40:44.622 --> 40:46.647
If the stones work
the way Daniel says...

40:46.724 --> 40:49.386
shouldn't General O'Neill have been able
to see elements of Joe's life as well?

40:50.862 --> 40:53.092
Theoretically, yes, he would.

41:08.412 --> 41:09.777
Bowling league Thursday nights?

41:11.582 --> 41:14.574
- You saw that?
- You got game, son.

41:15.219 --> 41:16.846
Wait a minute.

41:16.921 --> 41:21.017
You've been seeing parts of the life
of a barber in Indiana for seven years...

41:21.092 --> 41:22.491
and you never mentioned it?

41:22.560 --> 41:25.495
Yeah. Sure I did.
I know I did.

41:30.067 --> 41:32.092
No.
No, you didn't, sir.

41:32.837 --> 41:34.031
I didn't?

41:38.276 --> 41:41.677
- You didn't find that the least bit odd?
- Actually, no.

41:41.746 --> 41:44.738
I found it quite... relaxing.

41:55.726 --> 41:59.526
I only have 10 minutes, and I really
need to get right back to work.

41:59.597 --> 42:02.998
There's no easy way to say this-
I want a divorce.

42:03.067 --> 42:05.501
I know. I mean,
you have every right to.

42:05.570 --> 42:09.700
But before we get to that,
there's someone who'd like to meet you.

42:10.775 --> 42:13.107
Here he comes now.

42:16.314 --> 42:21.013
Charlene, meet General Jack O'Neill
of the United States Air Force.

42:23.387 --> 42:25.981
It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

42:28.092 --> 42:31.289
I think we have some things
to talk about.

42:39.937 --> 42:41.928
It's all true.
