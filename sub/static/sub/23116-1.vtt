07:59.233 --> 08:02.274
<i>What a great opportunity this is for
Kurt Sloane. Stepping into the last minute.</i>

08:02.354 --> 08:05.828
<i>With Hoskins out on a back injury,
this could go either way.</i>

08:08.870 --> 08:11.059
<i>At this point, Renzo,
I don't know what to expect.</i>

08:11.139 --> 08:14.062
<i>He comes, he wins, he disappears, he's back.</i>

08:14.142 --> 08:17.777
- <i>I'm completely confused.</i>
- <i>It looks like he means business.</i>

08:20.714 --> 08:22.371
- <i>Did you see that?</i>
- <i>Wow.</i>

08:22.451 --> 08:24.462
<i>Man, you gotta love this guy.</i>

08:28.991 --> 08:32.073
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, your winner...</i>

08:32.154 --> 08:34.615
<i>...Kurt Sloane.</i>

08:42.001 --> 08:45.560
<i>Hey, everybody, we're here with the winner,
Kurt Sloane. Man, hell of a fight.</i>

08:45.640 --> 08:48.597
<i>I want to know, what do you call
that finishing move?</i>

08:48.677 --> 08:50.730
<i>That was like the Hurricane armbar.</i>

08:50.812 --> 08:52.567
<i>That's what they call it,
the Hurricane armbar.</i>

08:52.647 --> 08:55.870
<i>Hurricane armbar. I like it.
I like it. Congrats again.</i>

08:58.452 --> 08:59.964
<i>Whoo.</i>

09:02.356 --> 09:03.901
<i>Whoo.</i>

09:08.792 --> 09:10.703
When I went down...

09:11.333 --> 09:13.152
...I must've blacked out.

09:14.553 --> 09:17.076
Don't ever scare me like that again.

09:18.106 --> 09:19.962
I had this dream.

09:20.942 --> 09:22.753
It's really strange.

09:42.329 --> 09:44.366
Promise you'll never leave me?

09:45.166 --> 09:46.977
I promise.

10:00.481 --> 10:03.237
Got a limo waiting for us
out front with a full bar.

10:03.317 --> 10:05.131
Let me grab a shower and I'll meet you there.

10:05.211 --> 10:06.711
Okay.

10:45.693 --> 10:47.616
Kurt Sloane.

10:47.696 --> 10:49.707
U.S. Marshals Services.

10:51.966 --> 10:53.789
What can I do for you?

10:54.269 --> 10:56.091
I don't know.

10:56.771 --> 10:59.795
You could come along quietly, I guess.

11:00.775 --> 11:02.684
What for?

11:02.764 --> 11:05.797
Apparently, tough guy, you killed someone.

11:17.057 --> 11:18.936
This is for Erick.

11:22.997 --> 11:27.909
Maybe you forgot.
About 18 months ago over in Thailand?

11:28.169 --> 11:29.377
No?

11:31.006 --> 11:32.728
That was self-defense.

11:33.808 --> 11:35.697
Oh, well, that's good.

11:35.777 --> 11:39.435
That's the kind of stuff that you want
to tell the judge once you get there.

11:40.115 --> 11:42.538
We're just all about getting you there.

11:43.318 --> 11:45.106
Can I see that badge again?

11:45.186 --> 11:46.697
Sure.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.670
Welcome back.

12:39.740 --> 12:42.130
Shock and awe.

12:42.210 --> 12:44.454
Just like you're feeling now.

12:47.414 --> 12:51.261
The man killed Tong Po.

12:54.988 --> 12:59.381
The odds for an American beach boy...

12:59.461 --> 13:01.332
...were astronomical.

13:04.032 --> 13:06.454
You'll be joining him in hell shorty.

13:06.934 --> 13:08.176
Maybe.

13:11.306 --> 13:14.229
What I needed was for you
to take his place...

13:14.309 --> 13:16.765
...as the next big attraction.

13:17.445 --> 13:19.735
That would have been.

13:20.695 --> 13:23.104
But you left Thailand.

13:23.184 --> 13:25.540
Thought you could go legit.

13:25.620 --> 13:27.307
Today...

13:27.387 --> 13:29.978
...is when you find out...

13:30.058 --> 13:32.611
...it doesn't work that way, does it?

13:32.691 --> 13:35.911
It is time for you to defend your title...

13:35.991 --> 13:38.406
...in another fight to the death...

13:38.486 --> 13:41.576
- ...don't you think?
- Never again.

13:54.248 --> 13:56.938
You're not smart enough to let me go.

14:03.060 --> 14:05.669
You touch me again and I'll break your nose.

14:18.997 --> 14:20.964
A sense of humor.

14:25.112 --> 14:26.420
Stop.

14:38.157 --> 14:39.891
This guy...

14:39.971 --> 14:42.644
...one more fight to the death...

14:42.724 --> 14:44.896
...against the current champion.

14:44.976 --> 14:47.056
That's all I'm asking.

14:47.936 --> 14:49.244
Voila.

15:17.798 --> 15:21.010
Step into the ring with Mongkut.

15:21.802 --> 15:25.749
I'll pay you one million American dollars...

15:28.091 --> 15:30.365
...tax-free, hmm?

15:30.945 --> 15:33.757
Or you'll spend the rest
of your life in prison...

15:37.785 --> 15:40.208
...without the possibility
of ever getting out.

15:40.488 --> 15:42.447
Just remember...

15:42.527 --> 15:45.466
...the men in this prison loved Tong Po.

15:45.546 --> 15:47.045
They know who you are.

15:47.696 --> 15:48.935
Shock and awe.

17:37.037 --> 17:38.578
They're making a move on you.

17:46.313 --> 17:48.124
I got this.

17:55.756 --> 17:57.813
You better call the prison doctor.

17:58.793 --> 18:02.272
Tell him there's three broken ribs
and a punctured lung...

18:03.981 --> 18:05.871
...a dislocated jaw...

18:06.601 --> 18:08.444
...and a broken nose.

22:42.141 --> 22:44.566
That wasn't too good, was it?

22:45.046 --> 22:47.602
One day in the general population...

22:47.682 --> 22:50.294
...and already in some sort of trouble.

22:52.752 --> 22:55.817
You're not going to make it, Mr. Sloane.

22:56.657 --> 22:58.680
At least not like this.

22:59.760 --> 23:02.143
Behind these walls...

23:02.223 --> 23:05.853
...you will have a fight
to the death every day...

23:05.933 --> 23:08.325
...so why not just take the money?

23:10.036 --> 23:12.893
When you agree to fight for me...

23:12.973 --> 23:17.612
...you will instantly go
from choking on your own vomit...

23:17.692 --> 23:20.434
...to comfort, wealth...

23:20.514 --> 23:23.593
...and provocative sensual amusement.

23:30.557 --> 23:32.114
Kurt...

23:33.594 --> 23:35.450
...are you in there?

23:36.230 --> 23:38.284
You with me on this?

23:39.307 --> 23:41.157
When you were a kid...

23:42.637 --> 23:44.914
...you get your ass kicked much?

23:47.907 --> 23:50.453
You look so much better
with that nose I gave you.

23:53.847 --> 23:56.204
I do love your spirit.

23:56.284 --> 23:58.095
Hate to waste it.

24:39.259 --> 24:40.515
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Honey, it's me.

24:40.595 --> 24:43.613
<i>Kurt, where are you? What happened?
I've been going crazy here.</i>

24:43.693 --> 24:45.842
I've been kidnapped,
I'm outside of Bangkok in a prison.

24:45.922 --> 24:49.827
<i>Kidnapped? Kurt. Kurt? What... where are you?</i>

25:58.171 --> 26:00.064
You interrupted my meditation.

26:00.144 --> 26:03.826
Meditation, really?
Does that help you stay calm?

26:06.157 --> 26:08.786
I am calm, very calm.

26:08.866 --> 26:10.724
I guess not.

28:11.854 --> 28:15.115
I keep my fist fast and hard.

28:15.195 --> 28:17.497
Ready to break anything that it hits.

30:29.926 --> 30:33.605
That's their way of implementing
an attitude adjustment.

30:39.836 --> 30:41.305
I want what you got.

30:41.385 --> 30:43.974
You took the lash without a whimper.

30:44.054 --> 30:45.863
Over here.

30:49.613 --> 30:53.460
Every day, I want you to come
down here and grab this plant.

30:57.554 --> 30:59.120
Deadens the nerves.

30:59.750 --> 31:03.536
Put them on your back at night.
The rest will have to do with your mind.

31:19.475 --> 31:21.765
- Can you walk?
- Maybe.

31:21.845 --> 31:25.803
Come on. Behind the wall.
You'll never fight the same way again.

31:25.883 --> 31:27.772
Trust me.

32:17.099 --> 32:18.611
Durand.

32:25.775 --> 32:27.287
Kurt.

32:33.649 --> 32:35.338
What are you doing here?

32:35.418 --> 32:38.342
- Training fighters.
- Here? Why?

32:38.422 --> 32:42.246
Because I was accused to participate
in the murder of Tong Po.

32:42.326 --> 32:44.098
Can you believe that?

32:44.178 --> 32:45.976
And also, I wouldn't give you up.

32:46.056 --> 32:47.907
So, Mr. Moore...

32:50.099 --> 32:51.956
...blind me.

32:52.736 --> 32:55.748
Don't get sentimental. It's a blessing.

32:59.909 --> 33:03.200
- How is any of this a blessing?
- Being able to use my sense...

33:03.280 --> 33:05.869
...without my eyes, it's a blessing.

33:05.949 --> 33:09.093
Being able to know the answer
before the question...

33:09.653 --> 33:11.464
...it's a blessing.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.372
Don't look in my eyes.

33:25.902 --> 33:27.714
You know the rule.

33:38.047 --> 33:42.072
Yeah. We have to find
a way to ratchet this up...

33:42.152 --> 33:45.376
...and still have him
in some condition to fight.

33:45.956 --> 33:48.612
We can always maim him later.

33:48.992 --> 33:51.603
Once we get bored with this.

33:54.230 --> 33:56.671
Are you ready to listen to me now?

33:57.601 --> 33:59.423
I know this guy.

33:59.803 --> 34:01.547
I know how to break him.

34:12.815 --> 34:14.085
Hey.

34:29.831 --> 34:31.710
I'm looking for my husband.

34:36.237 --> 34:38.562
I think he's in the northern jail.

34:38.641 --> 34:40.213
I also need to get to the kidnapper.

34:40.293 --> 34:42.480
This guy's name is Thomas "Tang" Moore.

34:43.179 --> 34:45.132
I know he's got more money than God.

34:46.683 --> 34:48.732
Well, it's not about the ransom money.

34:48.812 --> 34:52.342
Let me kick over some stones.
I'll meet you back here in two hours.

34:52.422 --> 34:54.344
Okay. Thanks.

34:54.424 --> 34:56.574
Don't worry. We'll find him.

35:36.132 --> 35:37.610
My man, Kurt Sloane.

35:46.809 --> 35:48.952
I still owe you two broken ribs.

35:49.032 --> 35:50.867
I may have deserved that.

35:50.947 --> 35:53.493
But I'm just here to talk to you.

35:53.573 --> 35:55.106
The answer is still no.

35:55.986 --> 35:57.821
Is it now?

35:59.222 --> 36:01.044
In that case...

36:01.124 --> 36:03.172
...I have something you might want to see.

36:14.270 --> 36:16.854
- If you touch her...
- I'm not the one you have to worry about.

36:16.934 --> 36:18.751
You know what he wants.

36:26.315 --> 36:27.860
Now...

36:30.086 --> 36:32.331
...are you ready to talk to Mr. Moore?

36:48.137 --> 36:50.220
Did you just say yes?

36:50.740 --> 36:52.077
Yeah.

36:53.843 --> 36:57.701
- What else they can do to you?
- They got my wife.

37:04.253 --> 37:07.077
I'm so excited about the fight.

37:07.957 --> 37:12.170
This is a fight I will pay to see...

37:12.961 --> 37:15.241
...well, obviously.

37:16.399 --> 37:18.211
I have my conditions.

37:21.137 --> 37:24.494
You may not have any contact with her...

37:24.574 --> 37:27.431
...or anyone else until the fight.

37:28.011 --> 37:32.002
But we can show you
she's very well cared for.

37:32.082 --> 37:34.471
- If anybody hurts her...
- We die.

37:34.551 --> 37:37.507
We all die. You die.

37:37.647 --> 37:40.059
Not you, you.

38:07.099 --> 38:09.397
<i>You have to feel his thought.</i>

38:12.905 --> 38:14.784
<i>The air move...</i>

38:17.109 --> 38:18.687
<i>...before it moves...</i>

38:20.547 --> 38:22.125
<i>...because...</i>

38:24.783 --> 38:26.574
<i>...you're him.</i>

38:27.304 --> 38:29.327
<i>Use his force as yours.</i>

38:30.657 --> 38:32.068
<i>Anticipation.</i>

38:34.893 --> 38:36.705
You didn't anticipate it.

39:16.535 --> 39:19.359
No good. Put your weight behind... that.

39:19.439 --> 39:21.280
Come on.

39:25.245 --> 39:26.846
You got to get past him first.

39:30.716 --> 39:32.468
I have faith in your ability.

39:40.626 --> 39:43.439
Tell me when you start
to feel it coming close to you.

39:46.598 --> 39:49.678
- Now.
- Take off the blindfold.

39:51.937 --> 39:53.849
It's too late to do anything.

40:06.618 --> 40:08.496
Well, that didn't work.

40:08.991 --> 40:11.801
- How's the training going?
- He's getting it.

40:11.881 --> 40:14.704
Oh, yeah? He may never get it, you know.

40:14.784 --> 40:19.419
- Oh, he got it in him.
- Listen, Briggs. I know his skills.

40:19.499 --> 40:21.138
And he may never be that good.

40:21.218 --> 40:24.431
He'd beat Mongkut... guaranteed.

40:24.721 --> 40:28.553
You mention Mongkut one more time
and I'll smash your big face.

40:28.633 --> 40:30.497
Oh, really?

41:13.439 --> 41:16.478
You see what I mean? He's blind as a bat.

41:18.278 --> 41:20.085
No more jail.

41:20.560 --> 41:22.382
You will train...

41:23.162 --> 41:25.852
...in the comfort of my luxurious...

41:25.932 --> 41:27.943
...suburban compound.

41:30.706 --> 41:34.583
So just sit back and enjoy the ride.

41:37.343 --> 41:38.932
I need my trainer, Durand.

41:39.012 --> 41:42.068
And I still need to train
with my prison group.

41:42.148 --> 41:45.038
I'm here to help. Done.

41:45.568 --> 41:49.075
I'll need a fieldtrip for an exhibition
fight when I'm ready.

41:50.520 --> 41:52.543
I love this guy.

42:19.084 --> 42:20.840
You have to start to train.

42:20.920 --> 42:24.378
- Start?
- Start. Start to focus...

42:25.658 --> 42:29.237
...and forget everything else.

42:31.430 --> 42:33.219
It's kind of hard.

42:33.299 --> 42:35.555
They kidnapped your wife.

42:35.635 --> 42:37.491
You have to fight...

42:38.271 --> 42:39.893
...a big monster.

42:39.994 --> 42:42.051
Let's laugh about it.

42:44.610 --> 42:48.538
Let's go back to the business
and get focused.

42:49.381 --> 42:51.185
Your strength...

42:51.995 --> 42:53.816
...against his weakness.

42:54.887 --> 42:58.767
It's your speed and your flexibility...

42:59.291 --> 43:00.939
...dexterity.

43:05.898 --> 43:09.844
- What's his weakness?
- That's a good question, Kurt.

43:11.437 --> 43:13.726
I would like to see Mongkut's training.

43:13.806 --> 43:16.816
How do you see anything? You're blind.

43:16.896 --> 43:19.566
Well, then, you have nothing to worry about.

43:19.646 --> 43:21.457
I just want to see him.

43:31.357 --> 43:33.252
Meet Mongkut...

43:33.332 --> 43:37.117
...a state-of-the-art,
miracle-bioengineering killing machine.

43:37.497 --> 43:41.187
A fighter bred
from generations of fighters...

43:41.267 --> 43:44.003
...with the top modern chemistry.

43:47.390 --> 43:52.403
By the sound of his breathing,
he sound like a rhino, right?

43:54.580 --> 43:58.405
His handler, graduated
Cambridge, top of his class...

43:58.485 --> 44:02.943
...went right to work for Mr. Moore
for a cool mil a year.

44:09.761 --> 44:13.120
- What is he doing?
- An adrenaline cocktail.

44:13.500 --> 44:15.853
This is not the way you know this.

44:16.603 --> 44:21.504
There's no drug testing for
illegal underground fights, right?

44:21.584 --> 44:24.163
This is not the martial art way.

44:24.243 --> 44:26.099
It's not the truth.

44:51.703 --> 44:54.874
Mongkut is a superior human specimen.

44:54.954 --> 44:57.750
Bigger, faster...

44:57.830 --> 45:00.349
...stronger than any
human being on the planet.

45:20.850 --> 45:23.171
Everything okay with your champion?

45:24.069 --> 45:25.892
Oh, yeah. He's fine.

45:25.972 --> 45:27.614
Oh. Yeah.

46:13.118 --> 46:15.021
Let Kurt live.

46:17.657 --> 46:18.868
I beg you.

46:23.695 --> 46:25.552
What about this...

46:26.232 --> 46:28.795
...I fight Mongkut instead of Kurt.

46:31.137 --> 46:34.862
- Well, it would be exciting, no?
- That would be exciting.

46:36.042 --> 46:37.644
I've got quite a following.

46:37.724 --> 46:39.578
That's true.

46:40.980 --> 46:43.992
One problem, you're blind.

47:00.198 --> 47:04.297
Me being blind would be a sensation
against the ugliest man in the world.

47:04.377 --> 47:06.879
The strongest man in the world.

47:16.549 --> 47:18.471
Yes, of course. Forgive me.

47:18.551 --> 47:21.040
But you see, a blind man fighting...

47:21.120 --> 47:22.742
...it could make a fortune, no?

47:22.822 --> 47:26.079
That's a really exciting prospect.

47:26.159 --> 47:29.904
But, of course,
I don't really need the money.

47:39.938 --> 47:41.994
Cancel this fight.

47:42.074 --> 47:46.216
You really thought you could appeal
to my better nature?

47:48.047 --> 47:49.858
Goodbye.

48:35.927 --> 48:39.807
You'll have to learn how to... fly.

49:03.054 --> 49:05.211
The strongest man doesn't always win...

49:05.321 --> 49:07.202
...but the smartest one does.

49:19.270 --> 49:21.081
Not bad.

49:47.766 --> 49:49.289
Thanks.

49:50.529 --> 49:52.359
I'm a friend of Liu's.

49:53.039 --> 49:55.094
- What?
- She told me you were here.

49:55.174 --> 49:58.387
Then they took her. I'm here to help you.

50:03.265 --> 50:05.716
Okay. Higher than that.

50:06.986 --> 50:08.997
High, kick high.

50:11.857 --> 50:15.691
Higher than that. He's six-foot ten.
Come on. Higher. Again.

50:25.336 --> 50:27.727
He will kill you in a second.

50:27.807 --> 50:30.296
Death has its benefits.

50:30.376 --> 50:32.565
- You will save a lot of expenses.
- I killed Tong Po.

50:32.645 --> 50:36.307
Mongkut is four times Tong Po, Kurt.

50:40.718 --> 50:42.530
You will lose.

50:49.160 --> 50:51.550
There might be another way.

50:51.630 --> 50:54.442
All I need is a third guy
to cause a disturbance.

51:09.514 --> 51:11.392
Well done.

51:13.118 --> 51:16.163
- Hey. Smoke?
- Yeah, sure.

51:26.965 --> 51:28.855
We just caught a break.

51:29.385 --> 51:31.924
The new guard over there.
He knows where she is.

51:32.004 --> 51:34.240
The dragon on his arm is in the video.

51:34.740 --> 51:38.386
You got to go now, do this thing
tonight while he's on duty.

51:46.017 --> 51:48.007
Time for that fieldtrip.

51:48.087 --> 51:50.531
I have to clear it with Mr. Moore.

51:53.091 --> 51:55.105
I'd get on that.

52:29.528 --> 52:30.789
The money.

53:25.815 --> 53:29.808
Master Durand, it's always good
to see you again, mate.

53:29.888 --> 53:31.310
Yeah.

53:31.390 --> 53:33.192
I know you.

53:33.272 --> 53:37.466
Kurt Sloan, isn't it? Yeah, I remember you
from that awful shellacking you took...

53:37.546 --> 53:40.019
- ...last time you were here.
- Right.

53:40.099 --> 53:42.576
Yeah. I'd trust you'd never
tried that again, huh?

53:45.304 --> 53:47.580
You know, Joseph King by name.

53:47.660 --> 53:50.947
- Joe King by nature.
- Ah, you've heard that before.

53:52.945 --> 53:56.102
So, word on the street has it...

53:56.182 --> 53:58.404
...that you're fighting Mongkut.

53:58.484 --> 54:00.639
Have you always been suicidal?

54:00.719 --> 54:02.675
Do me a favor.

54:02.755 --> 54:04.626
Can he fight your best fighter?

54:07.592 --> 54:10.289
So you're back to get your ass kicked, huh?

54:10.829 --> 54:14.509
Well, going to have to see
your money first, mate.

54:15.500 --> 54:17.111
Money.

54:22.707 --> 54:24.283
Thank you.

54:24.743 --> 54:26.729
Holy moley. Look at that.

54:26.809 --> 54:30.122
Easy money just walked in the door again.

54:31.402 --> 54:34.195
- Come with me.
- A moment.

54:35.653 --> 54:37.276
Remember...

54:37.856 --> 54:40.426
- ...we're not here for that.
- Yeah.

54:40.506 --> 54:43.399
- Be careful.
- I got this.

54:43.929 --> 54:46.819
Ladies and gentlemen...

54:46.899 --> 54:49.388
...we have a brand new challenger.

54:49.968 --> 54:54.526
Well, technically, he's an old challenger
with suicidal tendencies.

54:54.606 --> 54:59.265
Let's welcome this misguided,
unfortunate soul...

54:59.345 --> 55:02.157
...Kurt Sloan, ladies and gentlemen.

55:03.781 --> 55:06.172
A brave young warrior...

55:06.252 --> 55:10.409
...willing to risk it all to last
just two minutes in the ring...

55:10.489 --> 55:14.260
...with the one and only sole survivor...

55:14.660 --> 55:17.583
...the beast, the widow maker...

55:17.663 --> 55:21.109
...the bringer of pain, Moss.

55:56.067 --> 56:00.054
I hate violence.
I need to go to the bathroom.

56:00.134 --> 56:01.615
Yeah.

56:10.421 --> 56:12.289
I need your phone.

56:12.819 --> 56:14.397
I need the phone.

56:49.654 --> 56:52.134
- Travis.
- <i>Dad, is that you?</i>

57:22.120 --> 57:25.915
All right. All right. All right. All right.
All right. All right. Fight's over.

57:25.995 --> 57:27.579
Kurt wins.

57:27.659 --> 57:29.828
Nice bloody scam, mate.

57:29.908 --> 57:32.831
You come in once and make
an utter fool of yourself...

57:32.911 --> 57:35.655
...and then come back and mop
the floor with my best fighter?

57:37.035 --> 57:38.912
Come here.

57:41.939 --> 57:43.764
My take.

57:46.311 --> 57:48.789
Next time, we should be partners.

57:49.647 --> 57:51.658
Maybe next time.

57:53.785 --> 57:56.063
I guess all the training paid off.

58:05.563 --> 58:07.641
What the fuck is that bullshit?

58:10.001 --> 58:12.587
Move. Move. Move. Move. Move. Move.

58:35.524 --> 58:37.082
About time, pops.

58:37.162 --> 58:39.539
Whoa, it's my son, Travis.

58:41.098 --> 58:43.723
Time to go. Go save your wife.
Trust me, I'll take care of this.

58:43.803 --> 58:45.710
- Come on. Let's go.
- Go. Go.

59:02.788 --> 59:06.098
- Where the hell are we going?
- That's up to you.

59:06.178 --> 59:09.511
- You know where she is.
- I know where who is?

59:10.620 --> 59:13.894
You're standing right next to her
in the video. Where is she?

59:13.974 --> 59:16.017
Is that what this is about?

59:23.109 --> 59:25.864
All right. Listen, let's go to the river.

59:25.944 --> 59:27.191
North road.

59:29.046 --> 59:30.927
Aye-aye.

59:59.544 --> 01:00:01.317
What?

01:01:07.445 --> 01:01:09.040
Oh.

01:05:24.302 --> 01:05:27.436
So how many guys hiding behind these cars?

01:05:27.516 --> 01:05:30.292
- I'm telling you, this is it.
- No more bullshit.

01:05:30.372 --> 01:05:33.736
Let me go. I'll show you.
You're going to need me to get in anyway.

01:05:33.816 --> 01:05:36.301
Might want to start getting
a little more specific.

01:05:39.316 --> 01:05:41.940
- Where we going?
- Penthouse, top floor.

01:05:44.689 --> 01:05:45.695
Whoa.

01:05:47.025 --> 01:05:50.303
You're going to regret this, blondie.
I'm telling you, man...

01:11:18.889 --> 01:11:20.537
Go.

01:11:24.128 --> 01:11:27.141
Put your gun down. Drop your knife.

01:11:49.253 --> 01:11:50.708
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm good.

01:11:50.788 --> 01:11:52.542
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

01:11:52.622 --> 01:11:55.450
- She can shoot.
- Let's go.

01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:15.205
Put them down.

01:12:35.332 --> 01:12:37.553
You know you should not be here.

01:12:55.051 --> 01:12:56.629
No.

01:13:04.761 --> 01:13:07.049
Honey, wake up, honey.

01:13:07.131 --> 01:13:09.707
Honey, wake up, wake up.

01:13:09.787 --> 01:13:12.290
Wake up. Call an ambulance.

01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:14.982
Call an ambulance, right now.

01:13:19.476 --> 01:13:22.556
Wake up, wake up. Please, wake up.

01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:28.706
You tell Moore...

01:13:28.786 --> 01:13:31.382
...I'll fight that son of a bitch
anywhere, anytime.

01:13:56.113 --> 01:13:57.991
They told me that...

01:13:59.483 --> 01:14:01.739
...if she comes out of the coma...

01:14:01.819 --> 01:14:03.642
What is this "if"?

01:14:04.122 --> 01:14:05.493
Don't even think about it.

01:14:34.017 --> 01:14:37.263
I don't believe in church, you know?

01:14:39.523 --> 01:14:41.100
But...

01:14:41.892 --> 01:14:43.881
...I pray like a fool...

01:14:43.961 --> 01:14:45.805
...for you to come back.

01:14:47.731 --> 01:14:50.777
He loves you, he needs you.

01:15:14.291 --> 01:15:15.869
Kurt?

01:15:16.493 --> 01:15:18.071
God.

01:15:25.502 --> 01:15:27.347
You scared me.

01:15:28.638 --> 01:15:30.517
Now you know how I feel.

01:15:37.531 --> 01:15:38.975
I'm gonna fight him.

01:15:41.551 --> 01:15:43.429
I know.

01:15:47.224 --> 01:15:49.369
So what's his weakness?

01:15:56.366 --> 01:15:58.234
A glass jaw.

01:15:59.369 --> 01:16:01.248
When you have his heart racing...

01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.096
...you make your move...

01:16:05.176 --> 01:16:07.432
...but the timing has to be perfect.

01:16:08.112 --> 01:16:09.923
So what's the move?

01:16:11.381 --> 01:16:13.271
The kill shot...

01:16:13.351 --> 01:16:15.161
...right to the jaw.

01:16:53.156 --> 01:16:55.402
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:16:56.826 --> 01:17:01.174
...welcome to the original Muay Thai Temple.

01:17:02.866 --> 01:17:04.589
It all started here...

01:17:04.669 --> 01:17:07.893
...over 2000 years ago.

01:17:08.273 --> 01:17:11.545
The villagers sent their children here...

01:17:11.625 --> 01:17:13.438
...to study.

01:17:14.845 --> 01:17:17.201
And the teachers were masters...

01:17:17.281 --> 01:17:19.125
...of martial arts.

01:17:21.585 --> 01:17:23.674
And all the spirits...

01:17:23.754 --> 01:17:26.444
...of all the Muay Thai fighters...

01:17:26.524 --> 01:17:28.513
...who were taught here...

01:17:28.593 --> 01:17:30.448
...and fought here...

01:17:30.528 --> 01:17:33.973
...and found their mastery here.

01:17:35.832 --> 01:17:39.837
Their spirits are here with us tonight.

01:17:48.078 --> 01:17:51.669
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to bring out the man...

01:17:51.749 --> 01:17:54.505
...who brought us the biggest upset ever.

01:17:54.585 --> 01:17:56.774
And I was so amazed...

01:17:56.854 --> 01:17:58.709
...in this fighter's ability...

01:17:58.789 --> 01:18:01.275
...to withstand the punishment...

01:18:01.355 --> 01:18:05.183
...and waited for his moment.

01:18:05.763 --> 01:18:08.662
Some say it was pure luck...

01:18:12.536 --> 01:18:14.350
...Kurt Sloane.

01:18:50.507 --> 01:18:52.163
But today...

01:18:52.243 --> 01:18:53.798
...we will find out...

01:18:53.878 --> 01:18:55.733
...if that luck holds...

01:18:55.813 --> 01:18:57.535
...because here tonight...

01:18:57.615 --> 01:19:00.238
...to avenge the mighty Tong Po...

01:19:00.918 --> 01:19:02.873
...weighing in at...

01:19:02.953 --> 01:19:06.602
...400 pounds.

01:19:07.592 --> 01:19:11.349
He has killed over 20 opponents in the ring.

01:19:11.429 --> 01:19:13.784
Let's hear it for the man of the hour...

01:19:13.864 --> 01:19:16.354
...the biggest man of any hour...

01:19:17.134 --> 01:19:19.891
...the one, the only...

01:19:19.971 --> 01:19:21.793
...Mongkut.

01:19:32.082 --> 01:19:35.906
Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!

01:20:19.763 --> 01:20:21.752
An application...

01:20:21.832 --> 01:20:24.722
...was downloaded on your cell phones.

01:20:24.802 --> 01:20:27.918
You cannot bet during fight times.

01:20:27.998 --> 01:20:30.361
At the end of each round...

01:20:30.441 --> 01:20:32.530
...you can place another bet...

01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:36.300
...but you cannot change your original bet.

01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:38.357
Clear?

01:20:39.522 --> 01:20:41.594
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:20:42.385 --> 01:20:43.791
...make your bets.

01:21:03.206 --> 01:21:06.597
You've been well-trained, don't forget...

01:21:06.677 --> 01:21:08.199
...flexibility...

01:21:08.279 --> 01:21:10.923
...dexterity, and momentum.

01:21:15.535 --> 01:21:17.814
And remember...

01:21:19.055 --> 01:21:21.080
...the kill shot.

01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:25.040
Fighters.

01:21:44.614 --> 01:21:49.407
I'm so happy to hear
that your wife came out of her coma.

01:21:49.487 --> 01:21:52.710
I just want you to know that if I kill you...

01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:56.101
...I'm going to keep
that sweet ass warm at night.

01:21:58.928 --> 01:22:00.789
To your corner.

01:22:26.222 --> 01:22:27.789
Round one.

01:24:17.034 --> 01:24:18.923
Oh, shit.

01:24:19.303 --> 01:24:20.826
No.

01:24:35.745 --> 01:24:38.851
Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!

01:24:43.793 --> 01:24:45.161
Kurt...

01:24:45.241 --> 01:24:48.675
...you have to feel
the air move before it moves.

01:24:56.602 --> 01:24:58.390
That's right.

01:25:01.144 --> 01:25:05.072
Kurt! Coconut! Coconut.

01:25:17.895 --> 01:25:21.507
Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!

01:26:13.383 --> 01:26:15.194
Come on, Dad.

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.351
Let's hear it for Kurt Sloane.

01:26:27.431 --> 01:26:31.155
As he may not be here with us much longer.

01:26:31.235 --> 01:26:33.124
Kurt, wake up.

01:26:33.804 --> 01:26:36.260
Kurt. Kurt!

01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:38.216
This was a really bad idea.

01:26:39.576 --> 01:26:41.398
I know.

01:26:41.678 --> 01:26:43.460
I don't stand a chance.

01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:45.636
Thought we we're gonna make this quick.

01:26:48.351 --> 01:26:49.774
I have an idea.

01:26:50.754 --> 01:26:53.907
Don't let him hit you. I told you...

01:26:53.987 --> 01:26:56.313
...stay away from him, okay?

01:26:56.393 --> 01:26:58.437
Yeah, good tip, Dad.

01:27:02.298 --> 01:27:04.343
Moore wants us to finish this up.

01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:12.129
He's really big.

01:27:12.209 --> 01:27:14.086
I know.

01:27:29.994 --> 01:27:32.016
Get out there, put this guy down.

01:27:32.096 --> 01:27:34.218
Let's finish this.

01:27:34.298 --> 01:27:37.921
'Cause these are advanced rounds...

01:27:38.001 --> 01:27:40.892
...with the blades to the elbows...

01:27:41.472 --> 01:27:43.316
...to the knees.

01:27:49.772 --> 01:27:51.270
Round two.

01:29:18.788 --> 01:29:20.203
Yeah!

01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:40.750
Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut! Mongkut!

01:31:00.085 --> 01:31:01.891
He's dead.

01:31:02.973 --> 01:31:04.455
Yeah.

01:31:11.614 --> 01:31:13.838
Kurt! Kurt!

01:31:14.188 --> 01:31:16.262
Kurt, come on, please.

01:31:19.155 --> 01:31:23.028
You can't. You said you wouldn't leave me,
you said you wouldn't leave me, Kurt.

01:31:24.528 --> 01:31:26.040
Kurt.

01:31:40.843 --> 01:31:43.334
We have a winner.

01:31:44.414 --> 01:31:47.444
The greatest warrior in the world.

01:31:53.623 --> 01:31:54.900
Bravo.

01:32:12.425 --> 01:32:14.837
I would like to see his face again.

01:32:28.891 --> 01:32:31.103
Take me away from here.

01:33:11.167 --> 01:33:12.934
Holy shit.

01:33:14.404 --> 01:33:16.077
Oh, my God.

01:33:21.712 --> 01:33:24.034
To the greatest fighter...

01:33:24.114 --> 01:33:25.818
...in the world.

01:33:46.769 --> 01:33:48.892
Time for the third round.

01:33:48.972 --> 01:33:51.141
No, this is... this is over.

01:33:51.221 --> 01:33:53.297
Do I look dead to you?

01:33:53.377 --> 01:33:56.356
The only way I'm going down
is if you ugly me to death.

01:34:05.901 --> 01:34:07.821
Come on.

01:34:07.901 --> 01:34:10.748
- Take it easy.
- Do something.

01:34:11.728 --> 01:34:14.587
Fighters, to your corners.

01:34:19.635 --> 01:34:23.300
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're not cashing any payments...

01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:25.419
...this fight is not over.

01:34:28.278 --> 01:34:30.640
Double or nothing.

01:34:33.784 --> 01:34:35.539
At this moment...

01:34:35.619 --> 01:34:37.708
...make your bets...

01:34:37.988 --> 01:34:40.189
...double or nothing.

01:34:47.930 --> 01:34:49.505
The blindfold.

01:34:52.167 --> 01:34:53.746
Okay.

01:34:54.738 --> 01:34:57.494
And now, for the third round...

01:34:57.574 --> 01:34:58.961
...back from the dead.

01:35:01.211 --> 01:35:04.223
Kurt Sloane wants more punishment.

01:35:07.282 --> 01:35:08.489
Fair game.

01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:11.741
Go...

01:35:11.821 --> 01:35:13.777
...kill him.

01:35:29.405 --> 01:35:31.650
<i>You have to feel his thought.</i>

01:35:33.476 --> 01:35:35.495
<i>The air move...</i>

01:35:35.575 --> 01:35:37.656
<i>...before it moves.</i>

01:35:39.915 --> 01:35:41.331
<i>Anticipation.</i>

01:35:42.496 --> 01:35:44.178
Ooh.

01:36:19.628 --> 01:36:24.089
<i>The strongest man doesn't always
win, but the smartest one does.</i>

01:36:34.436 --> 01:36:36.265
Bring it.

01:37:09.338 --> 01:37:11.027
Kurt...

01:37:11.107 --> 01:37:13.085
...ground the big man to the ground.

01:37:20.916 --> 01:37:22.694
Come on.

01:39:59.474 --> 01:40:02.332
<i>Your brother was brave,
your brother was a warrior...</i>

01:40:02.412 --> 01:40:04.020
<i>...unlike you...</i>

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:06.324
<i>...such a coward.</i>

01:40:13.722 --> 01:40:17.147
<i>If you keep coming with the drive,
the desire, and the will to win...</i>

01:40:17.227 --> 01:40:19.118
<i>...I'll make you immortal.</i>

01:40:28.170 --> 01:40:30.093
<i>This is your destiny.</i>

01:40:30.173 --> 01:40:31.683
<i>Believe in yourself.</i>

01:42:39.838 --> 01:42:41.125
The kill shot.

01:42:41.705 --> 01:42:43.047
The kill shot.

01:44:51.633 --> 01:44:53.478
Shock and awe.

01:45:25.567 --> 01:45:27.123
Durand...

01:45:27.703 --> 01:45:29.726
...he's not that big.

01:45:30.206 --> 01:45:31.894
Okay.

01:45:31.974 --> 01:45:33.796
All right.

01:45:33.876 --> 01:45:35.732
Lift your hand, Champion.

01:46:45.647 --> 01:46:47.604
Trying to focus.

01:46:48.184 --> 01:46:51.541
- We're having fun?
- Durand, I'm trying to focus.

01:46:51.621 --> 01:46:55.645
Well, trying to focus,
like, to have a baby, you know?

01:46:56.175 --> 01:46:58.002
Just do it.

01:47:02.064 --> 01:47:05.822
Your wife was kidnapped,
your wife was kidnapped...

01:47:05.902 --> 01:47:09.993
...and now you have to fight a big monster.
And your wife was kidnapped, and no...

01:47:10.073 --> 01:47:11.995
...you have to...

01:47:12.075 --> 01:47:13.863
...a big monster.

01:47:40.226 --> 01:47:44.927
More than that, he's six-foot-ten,
higher than that, six-foot-ten, come on.

01:47:45.007 --> 01:47:47.263
Higher. Again.

01:47:48.943 --> 01:47:50.466
Again.

01:47:51.646 --> 01:47:53.168
Again.

01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:38.687
You son of a bitch.

01:48:41.113 --> 01:48:45.138
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, it's about to go down.</i>

01:48:45.218 --> 01:48:49.496
<i>It is time for your main event of the night.</i>

01:48:49.576 --> 01:48:54.133
<i>And now, introducing your challenger,
fighting out of the blue corner...</i>

01:48:54.213 --> 01:48:57.222
<i>...he is a Muay Thai black belt,
his record...</i>

01:48:57.302 --> 01:49:00.590
<i>...perfect eight victories, zero defeats...</i>

01:49:00.670 --> 01:49:03.006
<i>...fighting out
of Venice Beach, California...</i>

01:49:03.086 --> 01:49:04.707
<i>...introducing...</i>

01:49:04.787 --> 01:49:08.544
<i>...Kurt Sloane.</i>

01:49:08.624 --> 01:49:11.747
<i>And now, across the cage,
fighting out of the red corner...</i>

01:49:11.827 --> 01:49:16.953
<i>...his record is twenty-one victories,
zero defeats, one draw...</i>

01:49:17.033 --> 01:49:22.325
<i>...in all twenty-one wins,
coming by way of knockout...</i>

01:49:22.405 --> 01:49:25.061
<i>...fighting out of Rio De Janeiro, Brazil...</i>

01:49:25.141 --> 01:49:27.897
<i>...he is the undefeated defending...</i>

01:49:27.977 --> 01:49:31.534
<i>...Light Heavyweight Champion of the World...</i>

01:49:31.614 --> 01:49:35.638
<i>...Shogun Rua.</i>
