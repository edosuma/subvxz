WEBVTT

00:06.140 --> 00:07.308
- HMM.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.378
HMM.

00:10.411 --> 00:12.113
- WHAT?

00:12.146 --> 00:14.582
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

00:14.615 --> 00:16.384
- I GOT TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.389
- SO GO.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.724
- UH, TOO TIRED.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.629
I GOT TO GO
ALL THE WAY AROUND

00:28.662 --> 00:30.598
AND COME ALL THE WAY BACK.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.766
I HATE THIS SIDE
OF THE BED.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.503
YOU'RE CLOSER,
YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM FOR ME.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.571
- OHH!
NOT THIS AGAIN.

00:37.605 --> 00:40.108
RAY, YOU CHOSE THAT SIDE,
YOU WANTED THAT SIDE,

00:40.141 --> 00:44.212
YOU MADE YOUR BED,
NOW JUST SHUT UP IN IT.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.347
- I NEVER SHOULD'VE
TOOK THIS SIDE.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.582
I WENT WITH
MY CHILDHOOD INSTINCT,

00:48.616 --> 00:50.651
I TOOK THE SIDE
AWAY FROM THE DOOR

00:50.684 --> 00:53.587
IN CASE THE BOGEYMAN
COMES IN.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.789
BOGEYMAN GETS YOU,

00:55.823 --> 00:58.426
I'M IN MY SPACESHIP BY THEN.

01:02.496 --> 01:03.797
- WHAT IF HE COMES IN
THROUGH THE WINDOW?

01:15.809 --> 01:17.111
- I GOT TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

01:22.383 --> 01:23.384
HI, I'M RAY,

01:23.417 --> 01:24.685
AND I LIVE HERE
IN LONG ISLAND

01:24.718 --> 01:26.387
WITH MY WIFE, DEBRA.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.855
SHE'S GREAT
WITH THE KIDS,

01:27.888 --> 01:29.757
THE HOUSE,
EVERYTHING.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.692
OH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE DOES IT.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.394
WE'VE GOT
A DAUGHTER, ALLY,

01:33.427 --> 01:36.830
AND TWIN
TWO-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.133
IT'S NOT REALLY
ABOUT THE KIDS.

01:39.167 --> 01:42.270
MY PARENTS LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.604
THAT'S RIGHT,

01:43.637 --> 01:46.540
AND MY BROTHER
LIVES WITH THEM.

01:46.574 --> 01:47.908
NOW, NOT EVERY FAMILY

01:47.941 --> 01:49.743
WOULD GO BY
ON A CONVEYER BELT FOR YOU,

01:49.777 --> 01:51.645
BUT MINE WOULD,
BECAUSE--

01:51.679 --> 01:53.747
- EVERYBODY
LOVES RAYMOND.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.516
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

02:00.721 --> 02:01.755
- ALL RIGHT,
WELL, LISTEN.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.358
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY--
AGAIN.

02:04.392 --> 02:06.294
- YEAH, 'CAUSE, UH,

02:06.327 --> 02:07.761
WE'VE MISSED YOU
SINCE THIS MORNING.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.697
- YEAH.
[laughs]

02:09.730 --> 02:12.466
- OKAY, BYE NOW.
WE'LL SEE YOU.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.302
- OH, HEY!

02:14.335 --> 02:16.504
- ROBERT, LISTEN, EVERYBODY
WAS JUST LEAVING 'CAUSE--

02:16.537 --> 02:18.506
- OH.
HEY, IS THAT MEATLOAF?

02:18.539 --> 02:19.807
- YEAH.
YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.609
VERY DRY.
WE'RE THROWING IT OUT.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.744
- YEAH.

02:23.777 --> 02:26.947
- IS--IS THAT A SPOT
ON YOUR UNIFORM, ROBBIE?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.349
- WHAT? OH, THIS?
- YEAH.

02:28.382 --> 02:29.783
- OH, NO, THAT'S JUST
A LITTLE SOMETHING

02:29.817 --> 02:31.219
THAT THE LIEUTENANT PINNED

02:31.252 --> 02:33.521
ON A PARTICULARLY
DESERVING OFFICER

02:33.554 --> 02:35.323
AT ROLL CALL THIS MORNING.

02:35.356 --> 02:38.759
- WHAT DID YOU GET,
LIKE, A CONDEMNATION?

02:38.792 --> 02:40.361
- COMMENDATION, DAD.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.396
- OOH, LET ME SEE!

02:42.430 --> 02:43.597
- OKAY, GO EASY ON IT.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.433
- OH--
WHAT'S IT FOR?

02:45.466 --> 02:47.435
- PERFECT ATTENDANCE.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.340
THREE YEARS IN A ROW.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.275

02:54.308 --> 02:55.276
OKAY, BYE NOW.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.645
- OH--

02:57.678 --> 03:00.314
I AM SO PROUD
OF YOU, ROBBIE.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.250
- THAT'S MY BOY.

03:02.283 --> 03:05.586
ALWAYS...THERE.

03:06.987 --> 03:09.223
- HEY, RAY,
LOOK AT THIS LETTER.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.991
YOU'RE UP FOR
SPORTSWRITER OF THE YEAR.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.526
- HEY.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.694
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

03:13.727 --> 03:14.828
- YEAH, LOOK.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.831
YOUR NEWSPAPER SUBMITTED YOU,
AND YOU GOT NOMINATED.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.000
- OH, RAYMOND,
THAT'S MARVELOUS!

03:20.033 --> 03:21.669
- I KNEW I WAS SUBMITTED
TO THIS THING,

03:21.702 --> 03:23.371
BUT I DIDN'T THINK
THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

03:23.404 --> 03:28.309
- 1,095 DAYS
OF PERFECT ATTENDANCE.

03:28.342 --> 03:29.577
- LOOK, LOOK, LOOK,

03:29.610 --> 03:30.978
AND THEY'RE GOING TO
ANNOUNCE THE WINNER

03:31.011 --> 03:31.979
AT AN AWARDS BANQUET.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.481
WHOO!
HOO HOO!

03:33.514 --> 03:34.648
- I BET THEY GOT A BUFFET.

03:34.682 --> 03:35.949
- YEAH.
OH, HONEY!

03:35.983 --> 03:37.918
I ALWAYS TOLD YOU
YOU WERE A GREAT WRITER.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.587
- WELL, DON'T GET EXCITED,
ALL RIGHT,

03:39.620 --> 03:40.788
'CAUSE I'M NOT GOING
TO THIS THING.

03:40.821 --> 03:41.989
- WHY NOT?

03:42.022 --> 03:43.757
- IT'S JUST A STUPID,
MEANINGLESS AWARD;

03:43.791 --> 03:44.792
THAT'S ALL.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.827
- WELL, CAN I STILL GO?

03:46.860 --> 03:49.797
THEY GOT WHEELBARROWS
FULL OF SHRIMP THERE.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.532
- NOBODY'S GOING, OKAY?

03:51.565 --> 03:53.033
THESE EVENTS
ARE ALWAYS LAME.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.902
- WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO NEGATIVE?

03:54.935 --> 03:56.537
- YEAH.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

03:56.570 --> 03:58.706
YOU DON'T LIKE SHRIMP?

03:58.739 --> 04:00.341
COME ON, MARIE.
I'M HUNGRY.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.009
- WELL, AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED,

04:02.042 --> 04:05.513
YOU'RE ALREADY THE WINNER
IN THIS FAMILY.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.780
COME ON, ROBBIE.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.356
- BEST OF LUCK.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.358
I HOPE IT ALL
WORKS OUT FOR YOU.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.563
- RAY, WHAT IS
WRONG WITH YOU?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.064
THIS ISN'T A LAME EVENT.

04:24.097 --> 04:28.802
THIS IS A BLACK TIE,
PRESTIGIOUS, YOU KNOW, THING,

04:28.836 --> 04:31.439
AND IF YOU WIN, IT COULD REALLY
BE GOOD FOR YOUR CAREER.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.774
- OH, COME ON.
GOOD FOR MY CAREER?

04:33.807 --> 04:36.444
NO, THE AWARDS MEAN NOTHING,
ALL RIGHT?

04:36.477 --> 04:39.380
THE BEST THING TO DO
IS JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.514
- YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE.

04:40.548 --> 04:43.751
- OF COURSE!

04:43.784 --> 04:45.686
- BUT THIS IS
SO FANTASTIC, RAY.

04:45.719 --> 04:46.687
LOOK AT THIS.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.622
"SPORTSWRITER OF THE YEAR."

04:48.656 --> 04:51.692
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THIS IS GREAT
JUST TO BE NOMINATED.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.361
- "IT'S GREAT
JUST TO BE NOMINATED."

04:53.394 --> 04:55.028
THAT'S WHAT
THE LOSER SAYS.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.698
THAT'S--THAT'S THE TITLE
OF THE LOSER HANDBOOK.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.635
- HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
OF SOMETHING, RAY?

05:01.669 --> 05:03.404
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY
WIN THIS.

05:03.437 --> 05:06.607
- DON'T--LOOK, DEBRA,
DON'T MAKE ME WANT THIS.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.908
- IT'S OKAY
TO WANT THINGS, RAY.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.943
- NO!
NO, YOU'RE WRONG.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.645
LOOK, RIGHT NOW,
MY EXPECTATIONS

05:11.679 --> 05:14.448
ARE RIGHT HERE,
THIS HIGH.

05:14.482 --> 05:17.451
WHEN I FALL FROM HERE,
I SPRAIN AN ANKLE.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.353
I LIMP AWAY.
THAT'S ALL.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.722
IF I FALL FROM WHERE
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT--

05:21.755 --> 05:23.924
SPLAT!

05:23.957 --> 05:25.826
I'M SPLAT THE LOSER.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.028
"OH, HEY,
ANY WORDS FOR US, SPLAT?"

05:28.061 --> 05:32.633
"OH, OH, IT WAS GREAT
JUST TO BE NOMINATED."

05:32.666 --> 05:34.602
I DON'T KNOW.
NO.

05:34.635 --> 05:35.469
- FINE.
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

05:35.503 --> 05:36.837
WE WON'T GO.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.472
GOD, RAYMOND,
YOU'RE HOPELESS.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.517
- YOU REALLY THINK
I COULD WIN IT?

05:49.550 --> 05:50.851
- HONEY, COME ON.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.453
LOOK AT THE COMPETITION HERE,
ALL RIGHT?

05:52.486 --> 05:53.687
BILL SCHEFT.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.923
HE'S ALREADY WON TWICE,
SO HE'S FINISHED.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.458
CHUCK HEATON'S BIG STORY
THIS YEAR WAS

05:57.491 --> 05:59.560
"TOO MUCH VIOLENCE
IN BOXING."

05:59.593 --> 06:01.595
THANKS FOR THE SCOOP, CHUCK.

06:01.629 --> 06:04.998
I MEAN, YOU'RE ALWAYS TELLING ME
WHAT A HACK TED STANKOVICH IS,

06:05.032 --> 06:07.901
BUT, YOU KNOW, MOST IMPORTANTLY,
I KNOW YOU, RAY.

06:07.935 --> 06:10.771
I KNOW YOUR WRITING,
AND LISTEN, SWEETIE,

06:10.804 --> 06:14.408
YOU ARE REALLY,
REALLY GOOD.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.176
YOU ARE. THERE IS NOBODY
THAT'S BETTER THAN YOU, RAY.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.879
YOU ARE SPORTSWRITER
OF THE YEAR.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.552
- YOU--YOU DID IT.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.854
YOU MADE ME WANT IT!

06:35.062 --> 06:37.465
- RAY, THIS IS SO GREAT.

06:37.498 --> 06:40.000
OH, MY GOD, WE'RE OUT,
WE'RE WITH ADULTS.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.969
I DIDN'T HAVE TO
CUT ANYBODY'S MEAT,

06:42.002 --> 06:43.571
YOU SMELL GOOD.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.507
- THIS WAS A MISTAKE,
YOU KNOW?

06:46.540 --> 06:47.741
ALL THIS SMALL TALK
WITH PEOPLE

06:47.775 --> 06:49.042
WHO COULDN'T
CARE LESS ABOUT ME.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.144
- OH.
- IT'S TORTURE.

06:51.178 --> 06:51.945
- [gasps]
LOOK.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.915
RAY, LOOK.
THE SKATER, THE SKATER.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.450

WE ARE REALLY
BIG FANS OF YOURS.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.666

07:12.700 --> 07:14.868
RAY, I JUST WANTED TO SAY
HOW MUCH I LOVED YOUR ARTICLE

07:14.902 --> 07:16.804

SO GOOD LUCK.

07:23.544 --> 07:24.878
- WELL, THANK YOU.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.516
SEE?
TORTURE.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.117
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:30.150 --> 07:32.185
A BEAUTIFUL, FAMOUS SKATER
HAS JUST TOLD YOU

07:32.219 --> 07:33.921
HOW MUCH SHE LOVES
YOUR WORK.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.556
HOW CAN IT BE
BETTER THAN THAT?

07:35.589 --> 07:36.557
- I COULD BE SINGLE.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.060
LOOK, OF COURSE SHE'S GOING
TO SAY SHE LIKES MY WORK.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.228
SHE'S A SKATER.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.763
SHE'S DIZZY
FROM ALL OF THAT SPINNING.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.097
- YOU'RE RIGHT, RAY.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.633
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT.

07:45.666 --> 07:46.634
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

07:46.667 --> 07:47.635
IF YOU'LL ALL
TAKE YOUR SEATS,

07:47.668 --> 07:49.069
IT'S TIME TO BEGIN.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.771
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO GET
SOME FRESH AIR.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.105
I'M GOING TO JUST
JUMP OUT THAT WINDOW.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.007
- OH, SIT DOWN,
YOU FREAK.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.645

- CHUCK HEATON OF
"THE CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER"--

09:16.690 --> 09:17.791
- [blows raspberry]

09:19.927 --> 09:22.329
- AND RAY BARONE
OF "NEW YORK NEWSDAY".

09:22.362 --> 09:24.698
- WHOO!
[whistles]

09:24.732 --> 09:25.933
GO--
RAY, STOP.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.334
DON'T TOUCH MY HAIR.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.906
- AND THE WINNER IS--

09:36.677 --> 09:37.611
- [whimpers]

09:41.949 --> 09:43.684
- LOOK, RAY, YOU'RE JUST
GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE

09:43.717 --> 09:44.918
THE BEST OF THIS, HONEY.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.654
I MEAN, SOMETHING GOOD'S
GOING TO COME FROM THIS.

09:46.687 --> 09:47.655
YOU'LL SEE.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.757
RAY, COME ON.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.037
YOU KNOW, RAY,

10:04.071 --> 10:06.840
YOU'RE SPORTSWRITER
OF THE YEAR.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.709
YOU KNOW, WHEN MOST PEOPLE
WIN AN AWARD,

10:08.742 --> 10:12.045
THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE
THEY'RE PASSING A STONE.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.847
- YEAH, WELL, YOU TRY
LIFTING THIS THING.

10:13.881 --> 10:16.249
- OH, OH,
THE TROPHY'S TOO BIG.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.686
IS THAT THE PROBLEM, RAY?

10:18.719 --> 10:20.287
- I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S JUST--

10:20.320 --> 10:22.823
IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.725
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH
WINNING AN AWARD?

10:24.758 --> 10:26.093
- IT'S TOO GOOD
TO BE TRUE.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.661
- BUT IT IS TRUE!

10:27.695 --> 10:29.797
- THEN IT CAN'T
BE THAT GOOD.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.799
- YOU ARE SUCH A PESSIMIST!

10:31.832 --> 10:33.433
- I'M NOT A PESSIMIST.
- OH, NO?

10:33.466 --> 10:36.203
YOU ARE INCAPABLE OF
SEEING THE GOOD IN ANYTHING.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.004
WHAT IS THAT CALLED?

10:37.037 --> 10:39.006
- A REALIST.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.174
AND I CAN SEE THE GOOD
IN A LOT OF THINGS, OKAY?

10:41.208 --> 10:42.710
HOW ABOUT LAST YEAR
WHEN WE WENT SKIING

10:42.743 --> 10:44.244
AND I DIDN'T BREAK
ANYTHING?

10:44.277 --> 10:47.014
- THAT'S BECAUSE YOU SAT
IN THE LODGE THE WHOLE TIME,

10:47.047 --> 10:50.684
SAYING, "I DON'T WANT
TO BREAK ANYTHING."

10:50.718 --> 10:53.020
- I ENJOYED IT
IN MY OWN WAY.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.288
I LIKED
THE HOT CHOCOLATE.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.190
ALTHOUGH, I HEAR NOW
THAT FAKE SWEETENER STUFF

10:57.224 --> 10:58.191
WILL KILL YOU.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.459
IT'S CRAZY.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.394
- YEAH, YOU'RE NOT
A PESSIMIST, HUH?

11:01.428 --> 11:03.864
LISTEN, I KNOW
HOW YOUR HEAD WORKS.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.332
I'M GOING TO
PROVE IT TO YOU.

11:05.365 --> 11:08.702
LISTEN, YOU SAY THE FIRST THING
THAT COMES INTO YOUR MIND

11:08.736 --> 11:11.872
WHEN I SAY,
FOR INSTANCE, UM--

11:11.905 --> 11:13.006
LOVE.

11:15.843 --> 11:16.877
- WIFE?

11:16.910 --> 11:18.879
- [snorts]

11:18.912 --> 11:20.147
UH, NICE ANSWER,

11:20.180 --> 11:21.882
BUT IT TOOK A LITTLE TOO LONG
GETTING THERE.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.350
I COULD TELL YOU THREW OUT,
LIKE, 15 WORDS

11:23.383 --> 11:25.185
BEFORE YOU GOT TO "WIFE."

11:25.218 --> 11:26.720
- THEY ALL MEANT "WIFE."

11:28.856 --> 11:30.057
- OKAY, YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO THINK

11:30.090 --> 11:31.491
BEFORE YOU SAY
ANYTHING, OKAY?

11:31.524 --> 11:32.726
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I GOT IT.

11:32.760 --> 11:33.727
OKAY.
DO IT AGAIN.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.295
- OKAY.
ICE CREAM.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.230
- OH, I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO SAY "LOVE" AGAIN.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.899
I WAS READY FOR "LOVE."

11:38.932 --> 11:40.200
- NO, IT'S DIFFERENT
WORDS, RAY.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.334
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.335
ALL RIGHT.
GO AHEAD.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.837
- ICE CREAM.
- FAT.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.438
- SEE?
RIGHT TO THE NEGATIVE.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.439
ALL RIGHT.
BEACH.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.440
- SUNBURN.

11:47.474 --> 11:48.742
- MARRIAGE.
- COUNSELOR.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.110
- BAD.
- WORSE.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.144
- STEAK.
- STROKE.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.080
- SEX.
- TWINS.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.315
- THINK I'VE PROVED
MY POINT.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.884
I'VE PROVED MY POINT.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.352
- NO, THE TWINS ARE
A POSITIVE, ALL RIGHT?

11:59.386 --> 12:00.888
COME ON, HEY,
MAYBE YOU'RE THE ONE

12:00.921 --> 12:02.255
WHO'S A LITTLE NEGATIVE
AROUND HERE.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.824
- OH, FACE IT, RAY,

12:03.857 --> 12:05.859
YOU'RE A TOTAL PESSIMIST.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.828
- ALL RIGHT,
I'M A LITTLE PESSIMISTIC,

12:07.861 --> 12:09.963
BUT I GOT IT
UNDER CONTROL, OKAY?

12:09.997 --> 12:14.234
I CAN BE OPTIMISTIC
ANY TIME I WANT TO.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.435
- YOU ARE SO CLASSIC.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.170
YOU'RE IN TOTAL DENIAL.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.106
I MEAN, LOOK.
LOOK AT THIS.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.474
HOW CAN YOU
NOT ENJOY THIS?

12:21.508 --> 12:22.876
- IT'S REALLY EASY.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.477
- [sighs]

12:24.511 --> 12:26.914
THIS IS NOT NORMAL,
YOU KNOW THAT?

12:26.947 --> 12:29.917
YOU REALLY HAVE
A BIG PROBLEM.

12:29.950 --> 12:33.253
- IT'S JUST I'M BEING CAREFUL,
THAT'S ALL.

12:33.286 --> 12:37.124
I--I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WAS
JUST AN OCCASIONAL WORRIER.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.159
YOU KNOW, LIKE A GUY COMES UP
AND SAYS, "HELLO,"

12:39.192 --> 12:41.194
AND I'M THINKING, "HEY,
IS THIS GUY GOING TO HIT ME?"

12:41.228 --> 12:43.563
THAT KIND OF THING.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.366
- DO YOU LIKE
BEING THIS WAY?

12:46.399 --> 12:48.535
- IT'S ALL I KNOW.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.137
- YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.505
YOU CAN GET BETTER.
YOU CAN CHANGE.

12:52.539 --> 12:53.807
BUT LISTEN--

12:53.841 --> 12:55.508
THE FIRST STEP
IS ADMITTING

12:55.542 --> 12:57.811
THAT YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.950
- ALL RIGHT.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.485
I'M RAY,
AND I'M A PESSIMIST.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.421
- HI, RAY.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.397
- HEY, EVERYBODY,
DADDY'S HOME.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.399
- HI.
- HEY.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.400
- HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.870
- GREAT!
JUST GREAT!

13:25.105 --> 13:26.273
- GOOD.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.941
- YEAH.
- YEAH, OKAY.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.342
WELL, DINNER'S
ALMOST READY, SO--

13:29.376 --> 13:31.444
- OH, GREAT. GREAT.
GREAT. GREAT.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.445
WHAT ARE WE HAVING?

13:32.479 --> 13:33.513
- JUST ASSORTED LEFTOVERS.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.448
- GREAT!

13:35.482 --> 13:36.449
I LIKE VARIETY.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.851
- YEAH.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.219
- HEY, SWEETIE.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.521
[laughs]
HEY.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.292
- DADDY'S FACE IS WEIRD.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.927
- YEAH.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.528
GEE, SO, YOU'RE
IN A GOOD MOOD, HUH?

13:48.561 --> 13:50.964
- I'M IN A GREAT MOOD.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.432
- WELL, RAY,
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.267
YOU'RE REALLY
BEING POSITIVE.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.636
- YEAH.
I'M TRYING.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.338
ISN'T EASY, THOUGH,
I'LL TELL YOU.

13:58.371 --> 14:01.041
TODAY WAS ONE OF
THE TOUGHEST DAYS OF MY LIFE.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.109
- WHY?

14:06.413 --> 14:07.314
- I GOT A PROMOTION.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.982
- OH, MY GOD!

14:09.016 --> 14:10.450
THAT'S WONDERFUL!

14:10.483 --> 14:12.319
OH, SWEETIE!
- YEAH. YEAH.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.320
- CONGRATULATIONS!

14:13.353 --> 14:16.289
- YEAH.
IT'S A BIG--

14:16.323 --> 14:18.258
GOOD--

14:18.291 --> 14:20.660
THING.
- YES! YES!

14:20.693 --> 14:23.496
OH, SEE?
THAT AWARD WAS GOOD,

14:23.530 --> 14:25.999
AND SOMETHING GOOD
CAME FROM THAT, TOO.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.400
- RIGHT. RIGHT.
RIGHT.

14:27.434 --> 14:28.902
I GOT TO ADMIT,
I ALMOST HAD

14:28.936 --> 14:31.338
SOME NEGATIVE THOUGHTS
THERE, YOU KNOW?

14:31.371 --> 14:33.440
I WAS TEMPTED TO THINK
"PROMOTION--

14:33.473 --> 14:36.609
"MORE RESPONSIBILITY,
INTENSE PRESSURE,

14:36.643 --> 14:40.380
STOMACH ULCERS, HAIR LOSS,
BLEEDING GUMS."

14:40.413 --> 14:41.581
BUT I DIDN'T.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.150
- [laughs nervously]
- I DIDN'T.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.085
I JUST PUSHED THOSE THOUGHTS
RIGHT OUT OF MY MIND,

14:45.118 --> 14:47.988
AND I THOUGHT,
"EVERYTHING'S GREAT,

14:48.021 --> 14:51.658
BECAUSE I'M COMING
HOME TO MY FAMILY."

14:51.691 --> 14:53.961
[banging and screaming]

15:00.133 --> 15:01.534
OH--HUH.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.503
- OH, RAY, THIS IS REALLY
A HUGE STEP FOR YOU.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.238
- IT IS.
- YEAH.

15:05.272 --> 15:08.541
- AND, YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH
I GOT A PROMOTION,

15:08.575 --> 15:10.643
I'M GOING TO LOOK
AT THE BRIGHT SIDE.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.980
I--AS A MATTER OF FACT,
YOU KNOW WHAT,

15:13.013 --> 15:14.681
FORGET ABOUT THE LEFTOVERS.
LET'S CELEBRATE.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.116
LET'S ORDER IN, HUH?

15:16.149 --> 15:17.150
- OH, GREAT!
YEAH.

15:17.184 --> 15:18.218
- AND I'LL GET MY PARENTS,

15:18.251 --> 15:19.452
AND I'LL TELL THEM
TO COME OVER.

15:19.486 --> 15:20.253
- OH, RAY,
DO YOU HAVE TO?

15:20.287 --> 15:21.588
I MEAN, YOUR PARENTS
ARE ALWAYS--

15:21.621 --> 15:23.323
- AH, AH, AH!

15:23.356 --> 15:25.025
YOU'RE GOING TO TALK THE TALK,
YOU WALK THE WALK.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.659
- YEAH.
- TCK, TCK, TCK, TCK!

15:26.693 --> 15:28.528
- OKAY.

15:28.561 --> 15:32.065
OH, GREAT.
JUST GREAT.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.038
- HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.539
"PELLAGRA."

15:39.572 --> 15:42.242
"CHARACTERIZED
BY SKIN ERUPTIONS,

15:42.275 --> 15:45.045
"DIGESTIVE AND NERVOUS
SYSTEM DISTURBANCES,

15:45.078 --> 15:48.081
AND EVENTUAL
MENTAL DETERIORATION."

15:48.115 --> 15:50.450
- EWW.
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.052
- YOU WANT ME
TO KEEP GOING?

15:52.085 --> 15:54.454
- COUPLE MORE.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.990
- OOH.
"IMPETIGO."

15:58.625 --> 16:00.560
- HEY. HEY, EVERYBODY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:00.593 --> 16:02.629
- UH, JUST READING UP
ON DISEASES.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.764
YOU GOT NO IDEA
WHAT'S OUT THERE.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.000
- WE HEARD YOU WON
YOUR AWARD THING.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.369
OH, THAT'S
VERY NICE, RAY.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.138
- YEAH, ACTUALLY
IT WAS GREAT.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.672
YOU KNOW HOW I THOUGHT--
I DIDN'T THINK

16:12.705 --> 16:15.108
THE DINNER WAS GOING
TO BE A BIG DEAL?

16:15.142 --> 16:16.043
IT KIND OF WAS.

16:16.076 --> 16:19.179
YEAH, I MET KATARINA WITT
AND MARV ALBERT.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.780
- WAS DIMAGGIO THERE?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.349
- NO.
NO, DAD.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.484
- OH.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.520
WELL, AT LEAST YOU MADE
THE SPORTSWRITER HALL OF FAME.

16:27.554 --> 16:30.323
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
IT'S SPORTSWRITER OF THE YEAR.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.692
- OH.
JUST THE YEAR.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.496
- THAT'S WONDERFUL, DEAR.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.198
HOW MUCH DID YOU WIN?

16:38.231 --> 16:40.100
- I GOT A TROPHY, MA.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.734
BIG--BIG TROPHY.
- OH?

16:41.768 --> 16:43.170
- OH.
- NO CASH?

16:43.203 --> 16:44.637
- NO. NO, NO.
JUST THE TROPHY.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.539
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
BECAUSE OF THAT TROPHY--

16:46.573 --> 16:48.408
- OH, THAT'S NICE.
YOU GOT A NICE TROPHY.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.343
A NICE GOLD TROPHY.

16:50.377 --> 16:53.346
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
IT'S SILVER, MA.

16:53.380 --> 16:57.450
- WELL, I THOUGHT SILVER
WAS FOR SECOND PLACE.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.219
WELL, I'M SURE
IT'S A VERY NICE TROPHY.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.154
- YEAH, YOU--

17:01.188 --> 17:03.190
YOU BUST YOUR ASS
ALL YEAR LONG.

17:03.223 --> 17:06.093
AT LEAST THEY COULD
THROW YOU A FEW DOLLARS.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.730
- DAD, IT'S JUST--
IT'S MORE OF A PRESTIGE THING.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.265
- YEAH?

17:12.299 --> 17:13.700
TAKE THE PRESTIGE
THING TO THE MARKET

17:13.733 --> 17:16.136
AND SEE HOW MANY
EGGS YOU BRING HOME.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.341
- HEY.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:21.374 --> 17:22.342
- WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

17:22.375 --> 17:24.411
- I TOOK A SICK DAY.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.846
- WHAT--WHAT ABOUT
YOUR PERFECT ATTENDANCE?

17:26.879 --> 17:29.216
- WHAT, LIKE I NEED
ANOTHER LITTLE PIN?

17:31.284 --> 17:33.220
WELL, I HEAR YOU WON
THE AWARD LAST NIGHT.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.323
- YEAH, YEAH, I DID,
AND--AND IT WAS GREAT.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.125
AND I DON'T CARE WHAT
ANYBODY THINKS ABOUT IT.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.492
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.628
I THOUGHT SOMETHING BAD
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN FROM THIS,

17:41.661 --> 17:44.764
BUT, UH--YOU KNOW WHAT,
I GOT A PROMOTION TODAY.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.399
- PROMOTION?
- PROMOTION?

17:46.433 --> 17:48.201

17:49.569 --> 17:50.737
- THEY MAKE YOU EDITOR?

17:50.770 --> 17:52.272
- NO, DAD.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.840

17:56.609 --> 17:58.711
AND THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.348
YOU KNOW, MOST PEOPLE THINK
AN AWARD AND A PROMOTION

18:01.381 --> 18:02.782
ARE GOOD THINGS.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.417
I ENJOY MY WORK,

18:04.451 --> 18:07.387
AND I'M GLAD TO BE
RECOGNIZED FOR IT, OKAY?

18:07.420 --> 18:08.888
AND I DON'T--I'M GOING TO
PAT MYSELF ON THE BACK

18:08.921 --> 18:10.790
AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.294
- WELL, I MUST SAY, RAY,

18:14.327 --> 18:17.430
THIS IS A SIDE OF YOU
THAT'S NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.401
- WHAT?
- NOBODY LIKES A BRAGGER.

18:21.434 --> 18:24.637
WHAT ARE YOU,
GOING UPTOWN ON US?

18:24.671 --> 18:27.507
- YOU'RE REALLY BEGINNING
TO GET A SWELLED HEAD.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.743
WE DIDN'T BRING YOU
UP THAT WAY.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.180
- I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T--

18:33.213 --> 18:34.647
YOU KNOW,
I JUST THOUGHT I WAS--

18:34.681 --> 18:36.849
OH, NO,
WAIT A MINUTE!

18:36.883 --> 18:38.218
WHAT?
WHAT?

18:38.251 --> 18:40.253
WHAT AM I
APOLOGIZING FOR?

18:40.287 --> 18:42.189
LOOK, ALL I'M DOING
IS BEING HAPPY!

18:42.222 --> 18:43.723
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
EVERYBODY AROUND HERE

18:43.756 --> 18:44.891
WOULD BE
A LITTLE BIT HAPPIER

18:44.924 --> 18:46.326
IF YOU TRIED TO SEE
THE GOOD IN THINGS

18:46.359 --> 18:50.597
INSTEAD OF--
YOU JUST BEAT EVERYTHING DOWN!

18:50.630 --> 18:52.432
- WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
YELLING AT US FOR?

18:52.465 --> 18:55.134
IS THIS HOW YOU'RE GOING
TO HANDLE THE NEW JOB?

19:04.377 --> 19:06.513
- I GOT AN AWARD,
ALL RIGHT?

19:06.546 --> 19:08.848
THAT'S, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S GOOD.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.351
I GOT A PROMOTION, TOO.
THAT'S--THAT'S GOOD.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.885
THERE'S NO BAD HERE.
THERE'S NO BAD--

19:12.919 --> 19:14.487
THEY DON'T PROMOTE YOU
IF YOU'RE BAD.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.689
IF I WAS A PESSIMIST
LIKE THEM,

19:16.723 --> 19:19.226
I WOULD THINK IT'S BAD,
BUT I AM AN OPTIMIST NOW.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.294
I FEEL GOOD
ALL THE TIME.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.762
OH, LOOK, IT'S RAINING.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.698
OH, THAT'S--THAT'S GOOD
FOR THE GARDEN, ISN'T IT?

19:27.900 --> 19:29.469
- WHY DO PEOPLE
WHO CONVERT

19:29.502 --> 19:32.639
TRY TO DRAG EVERYONE
ALONG WITH THEM?

19:42.715 --> 19:44.817
- IT'S RAINING?

19:44.851 --> 19:47.220
- IT'S RAINING.

19:47.254 --> 19:48.855
BUT IT'S GOOD
FOR THE GARDEN.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.492
- OH, HONEY, I SHOULDN'T HAVE
LET YOU GO OVER THERE.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.426
I KNEW
YOU WEREN'T READY.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.228
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
- OH, MY GOD.

19:55.262 --> 19:57.530
- NO, TWO STEPS FORWARD,
ONE STEP BACK.

19:57.564 --> 19:58.898
- YEAH.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.336
- WHAT?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

20:03.370 --> 20:06.373
- OH, I THINK I HAVE
SOME BAD NEWS, RAY.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.741
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.610
YOUR EDITOR CALLED.

20:10.643 --> 20:11.744
THERE'S THIS RACE,

20:11.778 --> 20:13.980
AND THERE'S A GIRL
FROM LONG ISLAND,

20:14.013 --> 20:17.250
A 13-YEAR-OLD WHO'S GOING
TO BE COMPETING IN IT,

20:17.284 --> 20:20.587
AND HE WANTS HIS NEW
HEAD OF SPORTS FEATURES

20:20.620 --> 20:22.555
TO COVER IT.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.023
- YEAH?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.892
- IT'S THE IDITAROD, RAY.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.627
IT'S IN ALASKA.

20:31.631 --> 20:32.932
- OH.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.703
- ARE YOU OKAY?

20:36.736 --> 20:42.375
- THAT'S A TWO-WEEK DOGSLED RACE
IN 35-BELOW WEATHER.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.777
STANKOVICH COVERED THAT
LAST YEAR AND LOST A TOE.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.313
- OH, MY GOD.

20:46.346 --> 20:49.582
I'M SORRY.
IT JUST SOUNDS TERRIBLE.

20:51.518 --> 20:54.754
- YEAH, IT IS.
IT IS.

20:54.787 --> 20:55.822
- THEN WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

20:55.855 --> 20:57.857
THIS ISN'T EXACTLY
GOOD NEWS.

20:57.890 --> 20:58.758
- NOT EXACTLY GOOD NEWS?

20:58.791 --> 21:02.028
HONEY, THIS IS HORRIBLE!

21:02.061 --> 21:03.730
I KNEW THIS WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN.

21:03.763 --> 21:04.831
- THEN WHY AREN'T YOU UPSET?

21:04.864 --> 21:07.066
- BECAUSE I WAS RIGHT!

21:07.099 --> 21:09.902
OH, GOD,
I WAS RIGHT!

21:09.936 --> 21:11.971
I WAS WALKING AROUND ALL DAY
PRETENDING THERE WASN'T

21:12.004 --> 21:13.540
GOING TO BE ANY BAD NEWS,

21:13.573 --> 21:15.775
BUT HERE IT IS,
BAD NEWS!

21:15.808 --> 21:17.410
HELLO, OLD FRIEND.

21:17.444 --> 21:18.711

21:18.745 --> 21:19.912
YOU'RE FALLING OFF
THE WAGON.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.314
- NO, NO.

21:21.348 --> 21:22.382

21:22.415 --> 21:24.317
I AM A PESSIMIST!
THAT'S WHO I AM!

21:24.351 --> 21:26.553
IT'S IN MY BLOOD!

21:26.586 --> 21:28.087
THIS IS WHERE
I FEEL COMFORTABLE!

21:28.120 --> 21:30.923
OH, I'M BACK!
I'M BACK!

21:30.957 --> 21:32.825
- YOU KNOW, RAY,
YOU ARE JUST SICK!

21:32.859 --> 21:34.661
YOU'RE NOT HAPPY
UNLESS YOU'RE MISERABLE!

21:34.694 --> 21:36.963
- BINGO!

21:36.996 --> 21:38.665
COME ON.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.467
COME ON, LET'S GO HAVE

WE'LL JUST SIT LIKE LUMPS,

21:42.935 --> 21:44.871

IT'S EVEN WORSE!

22:02.789 --> 22:05.792
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU
IN A WEEK AND A HALF.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.860

22:07.894 --> 22:09.662
OKAY, BYE.

22:09.696 --> 22:10.797
I LOVE YOU TOO.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.732

22:12.765 --> 22:15.101
[muffled]
OH, HONEY, DON'T HANG UP!

22:15.134 --> 22:17.103
