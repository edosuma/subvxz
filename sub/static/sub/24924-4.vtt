00:06.460 --> 00:08.621
[theme music playing]

00:27.810 --> 00:30.028
[rock song playing]

00:32.150 --> 00:35.483
[Marcus] My whole life,
my father told me people will judge me.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.366
Justin, wake up.

00:37.450 --> 00:40.738
[Marcus] People will assume
they know who I am by looking at me.

00:40.950 --> 00:41.996
Justin, come on.

00:42.080 --> 00:45.072
We got to get you to Mrs. Baker
and the lawyers before court starts.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.036
[Marcus]
And that the deck is stacked against me.

00:48.130 --> 00:50.086
-Justin, get up! Come on.
-[Justin groans]

00:50.550 --> 00:51.369
[sighs]

00:52.260 --> 00:55.047
-I'm not so sure he got the message.
-It's disgusting.

00:55.970 --> 00:57.961
-He stinks.
-No, the clothes stink.

00:58.180 --> 01:00.000
He's been living on the street
for five months.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.727
[sighs]

01:05.140 --> 01:08.769
[Marcus] When you're faced with that,
when you're without power,

01:08.860 --> 01:11.818
on the outside, you have tough choices.

01:23.910 --> 01:26.652
-[Lainie] You're up early.
-Hi! Uh...

01:27.710 --> 01:28.779
Laundry. Yeah.

01:29.210 --> 01:33.328
-Is this new?
-Yes. It's, um, pre-distressed.

01:33.420 --> 01:35.797
-Clay, is that your gym clothes?
-Uh...

01:35.880 --> 01:38.371
-'Cause it smells--
-Yeah, um...

01:38.470 --> 01:41.598
I left them on the bathroom floor
last night, like I do,

01:41.680 --> 01:45.798
and you know,
at night, my aim isn't so good.

01:45.890 --> 01:46.879
[clicks tongue]

01:47.640 --> 01:49.767
Uh, your father had an early meeting,

01:49.850 --> 01:51.852
so it's just you and me
for breakfast, okay?

01:51.940 --> 01:53.931
Okay, great. Thanks, Mom.

01:56.070 --> 01:59.449
[Marcus] It's easy to hide.
To give in to the pain.

01:59.990 --> 02:02.197
Like Hannah did. She started to believe

02:02.280 --> 02:03.577
-that she was less than.
- [banging]

02:04.830 --> 02:05.649
Shit.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.530
[toilet flushing]

02:15.670 --> 02:16.830
Tony, it was heroin.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.041
I did, like, an image search
and it came up black tar heroin.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.846
He... He had heroin.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.888
[Marcus] To believe that a life
of privilege and position

02:26.560 --> 02:28.016
was only for other people.

02:29.770 --> 02:30.725
You're up early.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.852
You got Rodin coming over
for a yoga lesson?

02:34.480 --> 02:38.029
No. Just wanted to say good morning
before you went off to practice.

02:38.780 --> 02:39.599
Oh.

02:41.280 --> 02:42.190
Why?

02:46.490 --> 02:47.946
[utensils clinking]

02:48.040 --> 02:51.077
That girl's mother made a statement
in the press, apparently.

02:51.880 --> 02:52.699
Yeah?

02:53.920 --> 02:55.581
You haven't been following it?

02:56.090 --> 02:58.376
Uh, Dad and Warren told me
to keep my head down,

02:58.460 --> 03:01.122
so, you know, that's what I've been doing.

03:04.550 --> 03:06.302
So school's been fine, then?

03:06.970 --> 03:08.517
With all this drama?

03:11.560 --> 03:13.516
Yeah, yeah. Everything's great.

03:15.110 --> 03:18.022
You know, just gearing up for the season.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.271
Let me know
if you need someone to talk to.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.770
Dr. Pierce would be glad to see you.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.076
Or your counselor at school.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.786
What's his name? Mr. Porter?

03:35.500 --> 03:37.081
No, thanks. I'm good, Mom. [scoffs]

03:39.840 --> 03:43.674
-All right, honey. Have a great day.
-Yeah, you, too.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.670
-Don't work too hard.
-Yeah.

03:47.430 --> 03:50.763
[Marcus] But the truth is,
privilege is a trap all its own.

03:53.140 --> 03:55.608
What the fuck? What are you doing here?

03:57.020 --> 03:59.978
Tony told me to wait till your mom left,
then come through the window.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.104
Did I mess it up?

04:01.240 --> 04:04.061
Uh, no, the window's right,
but why did he send you ?

04:04.240 --> 04:06.447
-Well, he thought I could help.
-Help with what?

04:07.700 --> 04:09.941
I've got some supplies.
How are you feeling?

04:10.910 --> 04:13.242
Fine. Supplies for what?

04:14.040 --> 04:15.496
When is Tony getting here?

04:16.380 --> 04:18.450
He's not coming, Clay.
He's still on probation.

04:18.540 --> 04:21.168
He can't risk getting involved
now that he knows about Justin.

04:22.170 --> 04:23.000
What about me?

04:24.840 --> 04:30.005
[exhales] All right, so the thing is,
I was washing your clothes

04:30.100 --> 04:33.058
and I found your shit
and I flushed it down the toilet.

04:33.140 --> 04:36.223
And Tony thinks you might be an addict
and we might have to detox you.

04:37.190 --> 04:38.976
Fuck this. I'm out of here.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.311
Well, "A," all of your fucking clothes
are in the wash,

04:41.400 --> 04:42.856
and "B," where are you gonna go?

04:42.940 --> 04:44.692
We're gonna get you through this.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.367
You can't testify if you're high.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.406
-Okay?
-Justin. Justin.

04:56.540 --> 04:57.780
Jesus, what happened to you?

05:01.920 --> 05:03.911
You think Jessica will wanna see you
like this?

05:09.220 --> 05:10.096
No.

05:13.770 --> 05:16.136
[exhales] Shit. I can't miss school.

05:16.940 --> 05:18.225
Go. I got this.

05:18.520 --> 05:20.852
-I'|| text you every hour.
-Why are you doing this, Sheri?

05:21.650 --> 05:25.279
I spent the last five months
trying to make up for what I did.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.349
And now that I'm out,

05:27.450 --> 05:29.907
I realize it's actually gonna take
the rest of my life,

05:29.990 --> 05:32.151
so maybe this is where I start.

05:32.490 --> 05:36.199
[Justin gasping] I think I,
I think I ate too much breakfast.

05:37.870 --> 05:41.249
[Clay] Oh, fuck, Justin. That's my bed.
[sighs]

05:51.260 --> 05:55.048
Do you know who might want
to intimidate you, Jessica?

05:55.140 --> 05:56.300
I think it's pretty obvious.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.346
It's the same guy
who assaulted her in the fall

05:58.440 --> 06:00.396
and doesn't want her
opening her mouth In court.

06:00.480 --> 06:04.109
So, okay, if he's worried
that you would call him out,

06:04.480 --> 06:06.641
that means he thinks
that you know who he is.

06:07.070 --> 06:08.276
Yeah, well, I don't.

06:08.360 --> 06:12.979
Okay, even if you don't know for sure,
maybe you've got a feeling?

06:14.160 --> 06:17.118
Or maybe someone else
saw something that night.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.663
Because if you're scared to come forward,
for whatever reason,

06:22.500 --> 06:24.582
I want you to know
that we're on your side.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.582
You know, we can protect you.

06:28.970 --> 06:32.758
And it's safe to tell the truth.

06:32.850 --> 06:35.717
[Mrs. Davis]
Honey, is there something else?

06:37.270 --> 06:39.135
[Mr. Davis] You can talk to us, baby.

06:39.940 --> 06:42.977
And we're gonna get that bastard,
you don't have to worry about that.

06:44.940 --> 06:49.695
[Marcus] And we do ourselves no favors
by keeping our heads down, by hiding.

06:51.570 --> 06:53.652
You have to find a way
to hold your head up.

06:53.740 --> 06:55.537
[Mr. Cole] Say hi to Trish and the kids.

06:55.620 --> 06:58.327
All right, last call, I promise. You good?

06:59.370 --> 07:01.577
-Yeah, I'm good.
-Yeah?

07:02.460 --> 07:05.793
Uh, yeah, you know,
I'm just, like, a little nervous, I guess?

07:05.880 --> 07:08.872
Oh, my boy doesn't get nervous.
You're gonna be great.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.291
Just tell them
what you told the lavwers last fall.

07:12.050 --> 07:16.168
-The truth will set you free, right?
-Yeah, no, I know.

07:19.020 --> 07:19.975
But, um...

07:21.600 --> 07:25.058
But, Dad, like, what if they ask things
that they didn't ask before?

07:25.650 --> 07:27.891
Like, what if they ask me to,
you know, name names?

07:28.900 --> 07:30.390
-What names?
-I don't know, Dad.

07:30.860 --> 07:34.523
It's just...
Some of the other kids, they, um...

07:36.200 --> 07:38.077
they called out, like, friends of mine.

07:40.250 --> 07:43.413
Look, son.
You've worked hard to get where you are.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.661
Harder than other people
in the same position.

07:45.750 --> 07:49.334
And relationships are important.
They're everything.

07:50.010 --> 07:51.045
In any fair system,

07:51.130 --> 07:53.928
they wouldn't be putting you
in a position to make impossible choices.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.216
But it's not a fair system.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.421
And I want you
to look after yourself first.

08:02.850 --> 08:03.680
Yes, sir.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.265
You're gonna be great, okay?

08:09.280 --> 08:11.896
-[woman] Justice for Hannah!
-[indistinct clamoring]

08:11.990 --> 08:14.447
[Marcus] You have to ﬁnd a way
to belong in this world.

08:15.660 --> 08:17.946
You have to find a way to be strong.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.986
Hey, man. Can I sit here?

08:20.290 --> 08:23.077
I don't exactly have
the upper body strength to stop you, so...

08:23.620 --> 08:26.202
Well, maybe if you showed up
for PT yesterday,

08:26.290 --> 08:28.997
-could've worked on your left hook.
-Maybe I didn't feel like it.

08:29.880 --> 08:33.543
Wouldn't you rather hang out
with your actual ambulatory friends?

08:34.470 --> 08:37.758
Nah, no, I like my non-ambulatory friends.

08:38.180 --> 08:39.135
Good for you, then.

08:43.310 --> 08:46.802
[laughter echoing]

08:47.610 --> 08:49.760
-Hey, man, you okay?
-Yeah.

08:51.650 --> 08:53.982
No. I just... I remembered something.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.521
Or... I almost remembered it.

09:13.590 --> 09:16.548
-We love you, Hannah!
-Justice for Hannah!

09:16.630 --> 09:18.427
Oh, my God. Look at them all.

09:19.180 --> 09:20.215
What did I say?

09:21.310 --> 09:22.379
You spoke to them.

09:23.140 --> 09:26.018
You showed them who Hannah really was
and they heard you.

09:26.390 --> 09:27.266
[chuckles]

09:27.810 --> 09:28.845
[car door closing]

09:30.440 --> 09:32.146
-[Dennis] Good morning.
-Good morning.

09:33.150 --> 09:34.981
Your statement
had qUIte the Impact, clearly.

09:35.070 --> 09:37.026
-I knew you'd be upset.
-I'm not upset.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.026
They should hear from you
at the right time.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.862
People need to hear the whole story,
Hannah's story.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.783
-And they're not getting it in there.
-These kids are not on message.

09:45.870 --> 09:47.497
These kids are kids, Jackie.

09:47.580 --> 09:50.834
And they are the story.
We tell Hannah's story through them.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.296
-This Marcus Cole--
-Is a little politician.

09:53.920 --> 09:57.629
But he'd rather blame the school
than himself, and I can work with that.

09:57.970 --> 10:00.848
[Marcus]
When you're marginalized, powerless,

10:00.930 --> 10:02.557
you have to find strength somewhere.

10:03.350 --> 10:04.305
In friends.

10:04.390 --> 10:07.632
-Jess. Jessica.
-Hey, Clay, what's up?

10:08.940 --> 10:09.975
We have Justin.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.350
What?

10:13.860 --> 10:16.146
Over the weekend,
Tony and I went down to Oakland.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.446
But how did you know--?

10:19.030 --> 10:22.488
You saw the postcard.
You fucking snooped through my room?

10:22.870 --> 10:23.734
He wants to help.

10:24.740 --> 10:26.822
He said he'll testify, he's, um...

10:27.710 --> 10:30.577
-a little too sick at the moment, but--
-What do you mean sick?

10:31.920 --> 10:32.830
From being homeless.

10:33.840 --> 10:36.331
Look, he's at my house.
We're taking care of him.

10:36.630 --> 10:38.507
-If you want to see him or--
-I don't.

10:39.510 --> 10:41.751
Soon as he's better,
gonna take him to the Bakers' lawyer.

10:42.010 --> 10:44.422
-He can back up Hannah's story.
-It's not Hannah's story,

10:44.510 --> 10:46.307
and it's not his story, it's mine.

10:47.270 --> 10:48.419
I don't want him telling it.

10:48.980 --> 10:50.095
Jess, listen. Listen to me.

10:52.980 --> 10:55.141
[Zach]
I'm just worried about it. All right?

10:55.980 --> 10:57.891
I'm serious, dude. No, I'm not kidding.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.197
Ask your boyfriend for help with history.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.362
Oh, wait. He's brain damaged.

11:02.740 --> 11:05.152
You're just jealous
he had a brain to damage, Monty.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.993
Guys, if I don't ace this test,
I might drop below a C, okay?

11:08.080 --> 11:10.958
So play the dad card again.
Metcalf will let you slide.

11:11.250 --> 11:12.740
It's not a card, dude.

11:13.670 --> 11:17.083
No, I know. Fuck, sorry, brother.
You know what I mean.

11:17.170 --> 11:19.377
If Chle hadn't stopped
doing study group...

11:19.470 --> 11:22.428
I'm sorry, Zach.
I've just been so busy with everything.

11:22.680 --> 11:25.717
Yeah, "everything,"
meaning doing Bryce. [hissing]

11:25.810 --> 11:27.254
Hey, well, it's Zach's fault.

11:27.350 --> 11:28.669
-He set us up.
-Yeah.

11:28.770 --> 11:31.557
I gave him your number.
The rest of it isn't my fault.

11:32.480 --> 11:35.552
-Meaning what, exactly?
-Meaning I have to get to class.

11:38.780 --> 11:40.099
What's going on there, Walker?

11:40.190 --> 11:42.909
He's just got a lot on his mind.
I don't blame him.

11:43.240 --> 11:46.232
["Freeze Me" playing]

11:47.660 --> 11:51.209
Tell me what you think
Are we in trouble?

11:51.370 --> 11:54.828
Feelin' sorry's
Never really been my struggle

11:55.080 --> 11:58.914
Pickin' up the pieces
Siftin' through the rubble...

11:59.000 --> 12:00.752
[Marcus] When you feel left out,

12:00.840 --> 12:03.673
when you feel like this high school world
is against you,

12:03.760 --> 12:05.751
it can be lonely and frightening.

12:06.510 --> 12:08.558
I wouldn't want anyone to feel that way.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.630
Which is why I signed up
for Dollar Valentines,

12:11.730 --> 12:13.686
and why I invited Hannah out.

12:14.730 --> 12:17.016
And was there a reason
you chose Hannah In partIcular?

12:19.020 --> 12:22.069
I knew that she'd had
some tough times at school.

12:22.860 --> 12:24.350
It was her first year.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.526
I wanted to show her
that there were good kids at Liberty.

12:28.030 --> 12:29.611
Who'd you guys get? Anybody good?

12:29.950 --> 12:31.827
Nope, not really.

12:39.880 --> 12:40.699
[laughs]

12:41.550 --> 12:44.929
I see what's up, Dempsey.
Just looking for a sure thing?

12:45.550 --> 12:48.599
Yeah, not worth it, Zach.
Hannah Baker is a lot to handle.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.307
Yeah, I heard she plays rough.

12:51.140 --> 12:52.767
[laughter]

12:53.310 --> 12:54.846
Yeah, like you would know, Marcus.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.090
Yeah, aren't you saving it till marriage
or something?

12:57.190 --> 12:58.976
Isn't Jesus your one true love?

12:59.060 --> 13:00.061
[chuckles]

13:00.150 --> 13:02.220
I mean, doesn't mean
I can't cheat now and then.

13:07.700 --> 13:10.271
And it just so happens I got Hannah,
so maybe it's time to sin.

13:10.530 --> 13:11.576
Oh.

13:11.660 --> 13:13.491
[laughs] You know what?

13:14.250 --> 13:17.037
I'll bet you a hundred bucks
you can't even get your hands in.

13:20.000 --> 13:20.989
I'll take that bet.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.292
Well, maybe we underestimate you,
Minister Marcus.

13:24.670 --> 13:25.921
Maybe you do.

13:26.010 --> 13:27.716
[Marcus] So I asked her out on a date.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.791
Hannah Baker. Guess what?

13:30.010 --> 13:31.921
Hey, Marcus Cole. What?

13:32.310 --> 13:34.596
You were first on my list
for Dollar Valentines.

13:35.180 --> 13:39.355
[Marcus] She seemed excited.
Grateful for the attention. A little sad.

13:40.310 --> 13:43.313
Do you even like Hannah?
Or are you just trying to get with her?

13:43.400 --> 13:47.109
Yes, I do like her.
And I made a bet with Bryce.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.400
What is your deal?

13:49.700 --> 13:53.409
Some days you're this serious person
with legitimate plans for the world,

13:53.490 --> 13:55.651
and the next,
you're, like, this stupid guy.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.168
Like, one day you're Hillary,
the next day, Bill.

13:58.250 --> 14:00.627
Yeah, and which one was president?

14:01.920 --> 14:03.911
You do what you gotta do
to get on in this world.

14:04.130 --> 14:06.086
Especially if you ever want
to get something done.

14:06.170 --> 14:08.923
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
you have to be friends with Bryce.

14:10.090 --> 14:11.466
Yeah, it does.

14:14.930 --> 14:16.511
[Marcus] We met at Rosie's Diner.

14:17.180 --> 14:20.684
And at first it seemed like things
were going really well.

14:24.860 --> 14:25.679
What are you doing?

14:26.320 --> 14:28.891
I mean, she seemed
like she was having a good time.

14:29.070 --> 14:30.059
-Come on.
-No.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.073
And so, at some point,
I tried to hold her hand.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.940
But I guess she took it the wrong way.

14:36.790 --> 14:38.826
-And why do you say that?
-She yelled at me.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.781
Don't touch me! Get off!

14:40.880 --> 14:43.166
-[Marcus] Pushed me out of the booth.
-Hey, what the fuck!

14:43.790 --> 14:46.543
-[Dennis] Because you touched her hand?
-Yes.

14:47.130 --> 14:51.715
I mean, if a young woman yells at you
and physically pushes you off of her,

14:51.800 --> 14:55.304
don't you think she might have felt
threatened or unsafe?

14:55.390 --> 14:56.766
Objection. Speculation.

14:56.850 --> 14:58.590
Withdrawn. I'll rephrase.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.843
Marcus, did you at any time ask Hannah
why she pushed you out of the booth?

15:02.310 --> 15:03.140
No.

15:04.480 --> 15:07.688
[Marcus] Iwas confused.
I left right after that.

15:08.150 --> 15:09.606
And in the days that followed,

15:09.700 --> 15:12.863
did you talk to anyone
about your date with Hannah?

15:20.580 --> 15:24.129
I was hurt after I got rejected...

15:24.750 --> 15:25.580
Come on, dude.

15:25.670 --> 15:27.956
...so I vented _
to some of my frIends about It.

15:28.050 --> 15:31.213
-You couldn't keep it up, Marcus, huh?
-Oh, shut up, dude.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.040
[Marcus]
I never should have said anything.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.129
Nah, nah, man, look.

15:34.220 --> 15:36.131
She wants everybody
to think she's DTF, man,

15:36.220 --> 15:38.097
but she just likes the attention, dude.

15:38.180 --> 15:41.843
Hannah Baker is a cocktease, man.
Plus she's, like, batshit crazy, too.

15:41.940 --> 15:44.682
[Marcus] I should have known
people would twist my words.

15:45.230 --> 15:46.106
I feel terrible.

15:46.190 --> 15:48.146
Remember when she bum-rushed
the boys' locker room

15:48.230 --> 15:49.640
when that list came out? Oh.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.855
Yeah, man. Now that was crazy.

15:52.150 --> 15:54.562
-Hannah Baker, Hannah "Blue Balls."
-Hannah "Big Butt."

15:55.570 --> 15:57.902
[Marcus]
Because that's the thing about gossip.

16:01.160 --> 16:04.664
Once it starts,
it's hard to get away from it.

16:05.420 --> 16:07.991
-Jess! Jess, hey.
-Hi.

16:08.380 --> 16:09.665
Good job yesterday.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.831
-Good job?
-Yeah, in court.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.040
I heard they've been really tough
on people,

16:14.130 --> 16:16.792
but you stood your ground
and told the truth.

16:16.890 --> 16:20.883
-That's fucking brave, you know?
-Right. Yeah, thanks.

16:21.770 --> 16:25.262
Hey, listen, um, there's this thing
this weekend at Bryce's,

16:25.350 --> 16:29.104
and I have, like,
three different guys I want you to meet.

16:29.190 --> 16:32.353
It's time to get you an upstanding,
legit boyfriend, right?

16:34.110 --> 16:35.350
I'll see you at practice.

16:41.330 --> 16:43.742
[pop song plays]

16:48.130 --> 16:48.949
Thanks.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.916
Hey, guys. What are you doing right now?

16:52.170 --> 16:55.298
-Do you wanna ditch with me?
-Definitely. Is everything okay?

16:55.380 --> 16:57.587
Yeah, totally.
I just need to get out of here.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.172
-Guys, I cannot skip this class.
-Zach, we need you!

17:02.310 --> 17:03.925
-You need my car.
-[Jessica] Both!

17:04.980 --> 17:08.893
Look, if we can't have you,
can we... maybe...

17:09.520 --> 17:14.139
-Okay, but only if Jess drives.
-It's an automatic. My right foot works.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.066
-Jess drives.
-Thank you, Zachy.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.029
[car revs]

17:23.000 --> 17:24.456
This car is so insane.

17:24.750 --> 17:27.287
Shouldn't we steal it
and do a road trIp across the country?

17:27.500 --> 17:29.991
Yes, running from the law,
like Thelma and Louise.

17:30.210 --> 17:32.542
Yeah, if Thelma had a bum leg
and boy parts.

17:32.630 --> 17:35.042
[giggles] It sounds so sew
when you say it like that.

17:35.130 --> 17:37.257
-I mean, I am pretty sexy.
-You totally are.

17:43.810 --> 17:45.971
I love the movies on a weekday.

17:46.060 --> 17:48.802
No lines. No waiting. No people.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.390
Wow, you're in a crazy good mood.

17:50.480 --> 17:54.223
-It's possible I'm just crazy.
-Well, I'm good either way.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.059
Hello!

18:00.530 --> 18:02.361
I haven't been to a movie in so long.

18:02.450 --> 18:04.156
-I'm having all the popcorn.
-[scoffs]

18:07.000 --> 18:09.457
So are you trying to have sex
with her now or something?

18:09.540 --> 18:12.953
_ What? No. _
Why Is that any of your busmess, anyway?

18:17.590 --> 18:18.545
[Jessica] Hey.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.758
-You okay?
-Yeah. I'm just tired.

18:23.510 --> 18:24.761
No, not just tired.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.219
That night that we came here,

18:31.480 --> 18:33.562
-and Hannah confronted me?
-Hmm.

18:33.860 --> 18:36.067
I said that she was obsessed with me,

18:36.150 --> 18:37.686
and we should stop
being friends with her.

18:38.070 --> 18:41.119
-Yeah, but that's not your fault.
-Yeah, but I fucking lied, Jess.

18:41.410 --> 18:44.197
She was just hurt,
and then she called me out on it,

18:44.280 --> 18:47.659
and I got embarrassed, and I said
we should stop hanging out with her.

18:47.750 --> 18:50.457
I'm... such an asshole.

18:51.540 --> 18:53.121
We're both assholes.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.832
I got up there in court
and tried to help the Bakers,

18:55.920 --> 18:57.831
but I just ended up
making everything worse.

18:58.380 --> 19:00.621
I just kept remembering all of this stuff.

19:01.760 --> 19:05.673
I don't know, I just wish I could wipe
the slate clean and start over.

19:06.220 --> 19:07.175
No, you don't.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.300
It fucking sucks.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.141
-I'm sorry, I didn't mean--
-No, I know.

19:17.150 --> 19:17.980
Will you help me up?

19:20.450 --> 19:24.363
And did the school provide
any oversight or follow-up

19:24.450 --> 19:27.032
for this Dollar Valentine's Day program?

19:27.120 --> 19:29.281
No. Nothing like that.

19:29.370 --> 19:31.952
Incredible, so in other words,
Hannah suffered

19:32.040 --> 19:35.373
thanks to a misguided,
if not outright dangerous program,

19:35.460 --> 19:38.702
sponsored by
a grossly negligent administration?

19:38.800 --> 19:42.292
-Objection.
-Withdrawn. No more questions.

19:46.970 --> 19:50.633
Hey, what the hell, Tony?
You didn't ask me about Sheri.

19:50.810 --> 19:53.643
Yeah, 'cause I knew you would say no.
But she came through, didn't she?

19:55.230 --> 19:58.393
We can't just go telling everyone
about this. It's fucking dangerous.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.732
Oh, I'm aware it's dangerous.

20:01.820 --> 20:03.811
That's why I can't be
a part of it anymore, Clay.

20:03.910 --> 20:07.448
That's why you can't be part of it?
Or is it more than that?

20:07.990 --> 20:09.787
Why are you so worried
about your probation?

20:10.040 --> 20:11.200
You said it was no big deal.

20:11.290 --> 20:13.451
Yeah, that was when I thought
this case would settle.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.622
Before I had to testify or help clean a...

20:17.210 --> 20:19.087
help clean a fucking junkie up
so that he could.

20:21.920 --> 20:26.539
_Jessica doesn't even want him to.
She just wants the whole thIng to go away.

20:29.390 --> 20:31.972
If that's what Jessica wants,
it's out of our hands.

20:35.440 --> 20:36.259
Shen.

20:37.270 --> 20:41.309
Please, please just--
I'll give you some cash,

20:41.400 --> 20:44.312
just please go get me like half a gram,
that's all I need.

20:44.740 --> 20:48.278
And then I'll go to court
and I can testify,

20:48.370 --> 20:50.986
and you'll never have to see me again.

20:51.870 --> 20:54.498
And why do you think
I'd know where to buy drugs?

20:55.500 --> 20:58.537
Well, apparently you know
how to detox someone from drugs.

20:59.710 --> 21:00.916
I had a roommate.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.458
Two roommates in a row
who went through thIs.

21:04.970 --> 21:06.380
[sobbing]

21:06.470 --> 21:08.097
I'm so fucking cold.

21:08.890 --> 21:11.211
Then stop throwing this off
and do what I say.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.221
Here, take this.

21:19.610 --> 21:20.508
No.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.566
Look, we don't have time
to play games, Justin.

21:23.820 --> 21:26.607
Do you want to help Jessica or not? Huh?

21:27.160 --> 21:30.402
Okay, if you do, stop being such
a little bitch and get yourself better.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.229
Here.

21:35.040 --> 21:37.031
I've never heard you say "bitch" before.

21:37.330 --> 21:40.333
[scoffs] I've never had to babysit
your crying ass before.

21:45.670 --> 21:46.500
[coughs]

21:50.800 --> 21:51.676
You're welcome.

21:57.020 --> 21:58.396
[burps, sighs]

21:58.480 --> 22:02.814
So Hannah became physically violent
at the diner,

22:02.900 --> 22:04.686
when all you did was try to hold her hand?

22:05.570 --> 22:08.812
I mean, please explain to the court
how this makes logical sense.

22:09.200 --> 22:10.189
Could you, Marcus?

22:11.950 --> 22:13.906
I mean, well,
there was more to it than that.

22:16.660 --> 22:19.743
She was only being nice to me at first
because she wanted a favor.

22:21.040 --> 22:25.454
She had a crush on another guy,
and she asked me to set her up with him.

22:26.470 --> 22:29.837
And you know, I was hurt, and confused,

22:30.220 --> 22:33.804
and I tried to take her hand
to reconnect with her.

22:36.480 --> 22:37.549
That's when she pushed me.

22:38.270 --> 22:41.012
So after agreeing
to go on a date with you,

22:41.100 --> 22:44.513
Hannah used it as an opportunity
to score a date with another guy?

22:45.280 --> 22:46.099
Yes.

22:46.900 --> 22:49.061
Marcus, this is the first
we're hearing of this.

22:49.490 --> 22:52.448
Can you please reveal to the jury
who Hannah was asking about?

23:00.540 --> 23:01.700
He's a friend of mine.

23:03.880 --> 23:04.790
Bryce Walker.

23:05.420 --> 23:06.956
[indistinct murmuring]

23:09.470 --> 23:12.462
[Marcus] I don't blame Hannah
for being interested in someone else.

23:13.470 --> 23:17.918
Like I said, when you're on the outside,
you look for a way in.

23:23.310 --> 23:25.471
And Bryce Walker
is the king of our school.

23:26.070 --> 23:27.310
Any girl would want him.

23:57.310 --> 23:59.631
-[Clay] Shit. Sorry.
-Hey, man, it's cool.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.596
-Sorry.
-Are you okay?

24:05.520 --> 24:07.897
I'm fine. Why?

24:09.440 --> 24:10.395
You don't look so good.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.349
What do you know about it?

24:15.070 --> 24:17.903
[exhales]
Just that you don't look so good.

24:18.990 --> 24:20.196
Look out for yourself.

24:30.510 --> 24:32.546
Hey, Kevin. Got a minute?

24:33.090 --> 24:34.079
Sure.

24:35.430 --> 24:36.715
[pants]

24:36.800 --> 24:39.212
I'm on my way to do
the conflict resolution seminar

24:39.310 --> 24:41.722
-for freshmen--
-So good, all those extras you're doing.

24:41.810 --> 24:44.847
It really gives added value
at a very, very challenging time.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.357
Well, whatever I can do, Gary.

24:47.560 --> 24:48.640
Okay, along those lines,

24:48.730 --> 24:52.188
I understand that you made
a little house call.

24:53.740 --> 24:56.402
It's good sometimes
to take things out of a formal setting.

24:56.570 --> 24:58.982
-Huh.
-Contact with the parents is important.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.149
Yeah, of course. Of course.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.242
Uh, and you know...

25:02.330 --> 25:06.869
[stammers] ...I very much admire
that you take such big swings.

25:07.670 --> 25:09.160
But we're all under a microscope here.

25:09.420 --> 25:11.877
And I think we should discuss
what the best strategy is,

25:11.960 --> 25:14.929
especially in regards
to getting parents involved.

25:15.010 --> 25:16.295
-Hmm.
-You know?

25:16.380 --> 25:17.677
So you mean all parents?

25:17.760 --> 25:19.500
-Or just the Walkers?
-Well, I know.

25:19.600 --> 25:22.421
We'll see if we can make it through
the next few weeks,

25:22.520 --> 25:24.636
then we'll reconvene
after the trIal, okay?

25:25.270 --> 25:27.727
-I wanna make sure we keep our kids safe.
-Absolutely.

25:27.810 --> 25:29.437
-You know?
-Yeah, good work.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.099
[sighs]

25:40.910 --> 25:43.743
[Tyler]
This fucking trial is a fucking joke.

25:45.290 --> 25:48.453
Marcus said Hannah was in love with Bryce,
which is a fucking lie.

25:48.710 --> 25:50.166
I tell the truth, I get endless shit.

25:50.250 --> 25:52.798
Marcus does his politician thing
and blows back in

25:52.920 --> 25:54.581
like the fucking returning king.

25:55.090 --> 25:56.409
What a motherfucker.

26:00.220 --> 26:02.962
What the fuck, dude?
Why'd you bring my name up in court?

26:07.850 --> 26:09.556
Let's do this later, all right?

26:11.860 --> 26:12.815
I'll let you guys talk.

26:12.980 --> 26:16.143
Uh-uh. No, whatever you got to say,
just go ahead and say it.

26:16.740 --> 26:18.276
I mean, we're all brothers here.

26:19.860 --> 26:20.690
Right?

26:21.490 --> 26:23.822
[scoffs] Right. Yeah.

26:25.370 --> 26:26.189
Right.

26:26.660 --> 26:30.664
Look, I saw an opportunity
to do you a favor, so I took it.

26:30.750 --> 26:32.877
A favor? You think dragging me
into this is a favor?

26:32.960 --> 26:35.042
No, I planted a seed for you.

26:35.420 --> 26:38.583
See, now if you get called up,
they already think Hannah liked you.

26:39.300 --> 26:42.258
And if she came on to you,
and you let her down gently,

26:42.680 --> 26:44.671
who knows what kind of lies
she might've made up?

26:45.180 --> 26:47.171
Well, fuck me. Yeah.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.898
That's some high-level Jedi shit
right there, buddy.

26:51.190 --> 26:52.009
[chuckles]

26:53.230 --> 26:54.970
-Hey.
-Hey, beautiful.

26:56.650 --> 26:58.231
[Bryce, Chle kissing]

27:11.250 --> 27:12.319
[moans]

27:14.960 --> 27:17.167
-[Chle giggling]
-Fucking hypocrites.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.410
I say we do this today.

27:22.010 --> 27:23.887
[Bryce and Chle laughing]

27:24.350 --> 27:25.339
[Zach clears throat]

27:25.810 --> 27:27.516
[inhales] I'm ready.

27:28.060 --> 27:29.470
-[bell ringing]
-[door openIng]

27:32.480 --> 27:34.516
-Hi.
-Hey there.

27:35.440 --> 27:39.854
We just wanted to say hi, I guess,
and just see how you're doing.

27:40.990 --> 27:42.901
[stammers] Uh, I'm doing okay.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.076
Thank you. I...

27:46.120 --> 27:48.156
I mean, some days are better
than others, I guess.

27:48.910 --> 27:51.868
But I'm so happy to see you both.
How are you, Alex?

27:51.960 --> 27:54.702
I've been thinking about you
since I saw you at the deposition.

27:55.460 --> 27:58.588
Yeah, it's just like you said,
some days are better than others.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.963
But I'm meeting with the doctor soon.

28:02.050 --> 28:04.632
And hopefully, they'll clear me
to testify and everything.

28:04.720 --> 28:07.553
So, just trying to remember anything
that might help.

28:08.470 --> 28:09.960
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

28:10.560 --> 28:11.515
That means a great deal.

28:13.100 --> 28:16.888
I'm sorry for running away
the other day, at court.

28:16.980 --> 28:18.971
No, Jessica,
I'm the one who should be sorry.

28:19.070 --> 28:24.986
I just... [chuckles] I seem to be saying
all the wrong things lately.

28:25.320 --> 28:29.324
It's okay.
It was just a misunderstanding, obviously.

28:34.170 --> 28:34.989
Hi, Liv.

28:36.840 --> 28:37.659
Hi, Andy.

28:38.590 --> 28:41.206
So, anyway, sorry,
we just wanted to say hi, Mrs. Baker.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.256
-[Jessica] Was nice seeing you.
-Nice to see you.

28:43.340 --> 28:44.170
[Alex] Bye.

28:45.260 --> 28:46.579
-Hi, Mr. Baker.
-Hi, Alex.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.500
-[Jessica] Hey.
-[Mr. Baker] Jessica.

28:50.640 --> 28:52.267
-[door opening]
-[bell ringing]

28:54.640 --> 28:55.470
He's a good kid.

28:57.770 --> 28:58.759
I think they both are.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.140
I saw you on the news the other night.

29:04.110 --> 29:07.568
I thought what you said
was beautiful and brave.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.440
Thank you.

29:12.910 --> 29:16.073
Although they still managed
to use my own words against us in there.

29:17.460 --> 29:19.416
Uh, yeah, that woman you're working with,

29:19.500 --> 29:21.832
maybe she can afford to spend
her whole life fighting--

29:21.920 --> 29:23.797
She's not the one fighting, Andy. I am.

29:23.880 --> 29:25.177
Can we stop with the contest, please?

29:25.260 --> 29:27.216
I'm tired of the game
of who suffers more--

29:27.300 --> 29:28.927
Are you tired? I'm sorry if you're tired.

29:29.220 --> 29:31.962
Okay, I'm sorry if this isn't moving along
quickly enough for you

29:32.060 --> 29:33.630
so you can get some rest.

29:33.930 --> 29:35.886
You know,
not everyone can move on so easily.

29:35.980 --> 29:37.345
Nothing was easy.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.683
-You're a coward and you're afraid.
-Of course I'm afraid!

29:40.770 --> 29:45.104
I'm afraid of losing the case,
the store, our livelihoods, everything!

29:45.200 --> 29:47.407
We already have lost everything!

29:48.320 --> 29:52.654
There is nothing left worth having,
except justice for our daughter.

29:52.740 --> 29:57.200
And Jackie is the one that's been there
every day, making sure I get it.

29:58.920 --> 30:03.664
I'll buy you out of the store...
when we win the case.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.085
-If we win.
-We will win.

30:07.380 --> 30:09.211
Okay? Even if you're not there to see it.

30:12.760 --> 30:14.057
Are you living with her?

30:17.350 --> 30:18.385
No, Liv. I'm not.

30:36.370 --> 30:37.826
-[bell ringing]
-[door openIng]

30:38.330 --> 30:39.957
-[Hannah] Hey!
-Hi, sweetheart.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.701
-You're out early.
-I took the early shift.

30:41.790 --> 30:44.042
-Can I take the Jeep out later?
-On Valentine's Day?

30:44.960 --> 30:50.637
-Is this a, uh, date-type thing?
-Maybe.

30:51.220 --> 30:54.712
-Yeah?
-It's a hangout, really.

30:57.100 --> 30:59.512
-So, can I take the Jeep?
-Sure.

30:59.600 --> 31:02.728
We're just about to close up.
Maybe we can all ride home together.

31:03.270 --> 31:05.181
-Great. I'll warm it up outside.
-Mm-hmm.

31:05.900 --> 31:09.233
Hey, would you like to take
some Valentine's chocolate

31:09.320 --> 31:13.404
on your non-date hangout type thing?

31:13.490 --> 31:16.903
Mom, nobody takes chocolate on dates.
It's not 1950.

31:17.000 --> 31:17.944
Uh...

31:18.370 --> 31:19.701
I thought you said it wasn't a date.

31:21.210 --> 31:23.075
[Mrs. Baker giggling]

31:24.340 --> 31:26.831
[Marcus] Hannah was a troubled girl,
kind of a loner.

31:27.670 --> 31:30.161
I reached out to her, she didn't respond.

31:30.930 --> 31:33.546
And I guess it hurt a little,
to be honest.

31:33.640 --> 31:35.301
Hey, Marcus. Wait up.

31:35.390 --> 31:38.302
You know, I don't have a lot of time
to talk right now, Hannah, so just...

31:38.390 --> 31:40.267
Oh, it's okay. Uh, this won't take long.

31:40.640 --> 31:43.268
[Marcus]
She used me to get to someone else.

31:44.060 --> 31:46.267
Heard you're disappointed
with our date the other night.

31:46.360 --> 31:48.316
Look, I don't know
what you thought you heard.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.027
-But--
-No, I know what I heard.

31:52.070 --> 31:57.190
But, um, then I thought,
maybe I should give you another chance,

31:58.290 --> 32:00.576
see if we can try things your way
after all.

32:02.330 --> 32:05.584
-Hey, what the hell are you doing?
-Isn't this what you wanted, Marcus?

32:05.670 --> 32:06.580
[Marcus panting]

32:06.670 --> 32:08.911
Isn't this turning you on,
to be grabbed like this?

32:09.260 --> 32:10.909
Doesn't it make you want
to tear off your clothes

32:11.010 --> 32:13.797
and do whatever you told your friends
you were gonna do to me?

32:15.010 --> 32:18.594
Or was it just one big put-on, to pretend
you're something you're really not?

32:20.100 --> 32:22.136
But you won't tell your friends
about this , will you?

32:23.850 --> 32:24.839
[Marcus groans]

32:28.980 --> 32:30.936
[Marcus] I'm the student body president.

32:31.570 --> 32:36.314
Part of my job is to reach out,
set an example, lift people up.

32:37.280 --> 32:40.499
To look for those kids
who feel like "the other."

32:41.410 --> 32:42.900
Like they're on the outside.

33:03.100 --> 33:03.930
[students laughing]

33:04.640 --> 33:08.599
[laughing] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

33:08.690 --> 33:11.147
-[indistinct chattering, laughing]
-[phone cameras clicking]

33:11.530 --> 33:12.349
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

33:16.410 --> 33:18.480
-[man] Damn!
-All right.

33:20.080 --> 33:23.038
All right! That's... Okay, you got me.

33:23.870 --> 33:25.030
Very funny.

33:25.210 --> 33:27.075
[indistinct chattering]

33:47.150 --> 33:50.768
[Marcus] And I'll keep reaching out.
There are more kids like Hannah.

33:51.650 --> 33:53.606
And I want them to know people care.

33:57.570 --> 33:59.526
-Oh, shit. Oh, my--
-Holy shit.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.076
-That was awesome!
-Yeah!

34:01.160 --> 34:02.980
[panﬁng]

34:06.870 --> 34:09.532
What do we, uh... what do we do now?

34:13.000 --> 34:14.251
Have you shot a gun before?

34:34.400 --> 34:37.642
Hey, man, almost forgot.
You know that midterm you got tomorrow?

34:38.450 --> 34:40.270
I talked to a buddy
who took the class last year.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.408
He said Metcalf always uses the same test.

34:48.830 --> 34:49.956
Shit, man.

34:51.330 --> 34:54.709
-Thank you.
-I got you. Always.

35:08.350 --> 35:09.806
[Marcus] And I know Bryce feels the same.

35:11.270 --> 35:12.680
It's up to us to be the good guys.

35:17.320 --> 35:18.275
[gaSPS]

35:28.450 --> 35:29.405
[Chle whispers] Wait.

35:30.330 --> 35:32.412
-Isn't your mom home?
-She might be.

35:33.630 --> 35:34.619
Doesn't matter.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.416
I thought I'd go introduce myself.

35:40.050 --> 35:43.884
-Since you haven't.
-Hey, get back here.

35:44.800 --> 35:48.099
What, am I not the kind of girl
you can take home to Mom?

35:48.770 --> 35:49.634
I hope not.

35:50.690 --> 35:54.057
You know what? I'm offended.
This isn't happening right now.

35:54.650 --> 35:55.469
[chuckles]

35:56.650 --> 35:59.813
-Oh, it's happening.
-Get away from me.

36:00.440 --> 36:02.408
[mimics Chle] "Get away from me."

36:05.450 --> 36:07.111
You just take whatever you want?

36:08.240 --> 36:09.366
You're damn right.

36:11.960 --> 36:13.359
[Bryce moans]

36:18.670 --> 36:19.625
[groans]

36:29.520 --> 36:31.590
["Pillar of Truth" plays]

36:37.020 --> 36:39.853
[Jessica] I remember when they said
you would never walk again.

36:40.480 --> 36:41.435
Or talk.

36:42.110 --> 36:44.192
Or even be you anymore.

36:44.280 --> 36:46.521
[Alex]
Well, the jury's still out on that one.

36:50.120 --> 36:54.113
Ijust feel like...
I have this body, you know?

36:55.830 --> 36:58.993
And every day it gets up
and puts on clothes

36:59.090 --> 37:02.582
and gets me from point A to point B.

37:05.340 --> 37:08.173
But it's like it's not mine anymore
or something.

37:09.310 --> 37:10.425
Yeah.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.846
It's like you're living
in a stranger's body.

37:14.190 --> 37:16.181
And mind, sometimes.

37:17.690 --> 37:18.509
Yeah.

37:18.610 --> 37:21.977
The pillar of truth

37:22.110 --> 37:22.929
Come on.

37:23.780 --> 37:26.101
Turning to dust

37:27.370 --> 37:28.268
[Alex] Yep.

37:31.830 --> 37:33.821
[both speak indistinctly]

37:40.840 --> 37:44.298
Lord, prepare me

37:45.170 --> 37:48.048
For the shadows

37:49.390 --> 37:56.137
For the sparrows at my window

37:57.900 --> 38:01.017
Lord have mercy

38:01.820 --> 38:05.529
On my descendants

38:06.860 --> 38:13.072
For they know not what they do

38:15.450 --> 38:17.111
For they know not...

38:17.370 --> 38:19.782
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-No, no. Keep going, keep going.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.871
Who you are

38:23.920 --> 38:27.048
And they know not

38:28.130 --> 38:29.256
What to do

38:31.100 --> 38:32.385
-No, please!
-Sorry, I'm--

38:32.640 --> 38:34.801
-Jess, I'm so sorry.
-No, no. It's not you, okay?

38:34.890 --> 38:37.131
It's just... It's not you.

38:37.560 --> 38:38.379
Okay.

38:40.480 --> 38:42.812
Justin's back. Did you know that?

38:42.900 --> 38:45.733
Clay and Tony went out to find him
and he's at Clay's house right now.

38:45.820 --> 38:46.684
What the fuck?

38:46.900 --> 38:50.154
Clay says he wants to help me.
Can you believe that?

38:53.620 --> 38:55.485
-What are you gonna do?
-No. Nothing!

38:56.620 --> 38:59.327
Fuck Justin, okay?
I never wanna see him again in my life.

39:01.790 --> 39:03.246
Come on. It's late.

39:14.350 --> 39:16.090
-Sheri, what the hell?
-Oh, what's up, Clay?

39:16.560 --> 39:19.267
-You were supposed to text me every hour.
-Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.

39:19.350 --> 39:22.148
Look, I got so
into these Alien Killer Robots.

39:22.610 --> 39:25.818
The way they draw these robots
is kinda sew.

39:26.900 --> 39:29.391
-Wait, did you--?
-Don't worry, I only took out the comics.

39:30.950 --> 39:32.565
-Jesus.
-[Sheri] "Studded and ribbed."

39:33.120 --> 39:35.520
-Slqe's a lucky girl.
-Yeah, she's not, actually.

39:35.910 --> 39:38.037
She's gone. Fucking ran.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.202
Fuck you, Justin.
You don't know anything about it.

39:41.750 --> 39:43.706
I don't know anything
about fucking running?

39:43.790 --> 39:46.543
I'm like a fucking ex-- Oh, shit!

39:46.800 --> 39:48.199
-Fuck!
-It's the stomach cramps.

39:48.300 --> 39:49.790
Are you good to take over from here?

39:49.880 --> 39:52.007
I'm supposed to be home
right after school.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.716
I got it. You can take the stairs.
No one's home.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.883
And make sure you keep him hydrated.
He's gonna have a lot of fevers.

39:57.970 --> 40:00.097
He may talk a lot of shit
but don't let it get to you.

40:00.180 --> 40:01.306
He's just in a lot of pain.

40:02.810 --> 40:03.640
Good.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.179
-[door opening]
-Thank you.

40:11.860 --> 40:12.849
Yeah.

40:14.410 --> 40:16.366
-[door closing]
-[groans] Did you talk to Jessica?

40:18.040 --> 40:18.859
Yeah.

40:19.910 --> 40:23.459
Yeah, she, uh, wanted me to thank you.
She's happy you're here.

40:24.830 --> 40:29.039
-You-- You didn't tell her all about--?
-No. I told her you had the flu.

40:30.340 --> 40:32.126
[laughs] That's good.

40:36.260 --> 40:37.340
So we're gonna do this?

40:41.140 --> 40:43.802
-We're gonna take down Bryce?
-Yeah.

40:44.980 --> 40:45.799
We are.

40:45.900 --> 40:47.436
[retches]

40:48.440 --> 40:49.270
[Justin] Ugh!

40:50.030 --> 40:53.067
In 72 to 96 hours.

40:54.700 --> 40:58.329
I thought maybe the sign in my yard
was just about my dad's campaign.

40:58.410 --> 41:01.902
-But somebody is targeting me.
-[Mr. Porter] That's terrible.

41:03.830 --> 41:06.162
And you have no idea
who might have done it?

41:07.880 --> 41:08.699
No.

41:08.790 --> 41:10.746
You can't think of anyone
you may have hurt?

41:11.760 --> 41:17.426
Or anyone that may have...
a reason not to like you?

41:18.600 --> 41:21.171
Hey, I'm... I'm the victim here.

41:21.270 --> 41:24.091
Marcus, let me, uh, ask you something.

41:24.190 --> 41:26.647
Your father,
he's a churchgoing man, right?

41:27.350 --> 41:28.226
Yeah.

41:28.810 --> 41:31.529
What do you think he would say
if he listened to your tape?

41:33.030 --> 41:35.646
[scoffs] What would your wife say
if she listened to yours?

41:36.110 --> 41:39.864
Oh, I already told my wife everything.

41:42.240 --> 41:44.902
And I've taken a long,
hard look in the mirror.

41:46.210 --> 41:47.165
Have you?

41:50.840 --> 41:52.580
Just find out who did this.

41:52.670 --> 41:56.879
Marcus, I am on borrowed time here
at Liberty and I know it.

41:57.180 --> 41:58.829
But as long as I am here,

41:59.350 --> 42:02.217
I'm gonna make sure that the kids
who actually need my help get it.

42:02.680 --> 42:06.059
And those that need something else?
That they get that, too.

42:22.030 --> 42:23.281
Holy shit.

42:24.580 --> 42:27.993
I thought you were talking about BB guns.
What do you use these for?

42:29.170 --> 42:31.627
[Tyler]
Just, you know, shooting cans and stuff.

42:32.880 --> 42:34.950
But if you don't want to try it,
we don't have to.

42:35.050 --> 42:36.836
Oh, hell yeah, I want to try it!

42:38.340 --> 42:40.217
You have to teach me how to do it.

42:41.470 --> 42:44.212
Yeah, of course. Here, just let me.

42:53.400 --> 42:57.234
This one's got a bit of a kick to it.
Okay? So just be ready for it.

43:00.530 --> 43:02.486
Yeah, hold the gun
with your dominant hand.

43:02.950 --> 43:07.239
Keep your finger outside, okay?
Until you're ready to shoot.

43:07.330 --> 43:10.743
Use your other hand to cradle
the gun underneath, it keeps it steady.

43:11.210 --> 43:12.871
This shit's heaw. [laughs]

43:16.260 --> 43:17.909
-[Cyrus] Like that?
-[Tyler] Yeah.

43:18.010 --> 43:19.875
-Safety?
-Yeah.

43:22.220 --> 43:23.255
Pick a target.

43:24.680 --> 43:27.808
And when you're ready,
okay, turn the safety off...

43:31.190 --> 43:32.646
put your finger on the trigger...

43:34.820 --> 43:36.606
and squeeze your hands together like this.

43:44.330 --> 43:46.230
Ha! Woo!

43:47.580 --> 43:48.399
Woo!

44:00.760 --> 44:04.389
He thinks he can just walk in here,
giving me advice about Jackie,

44:05.300 --> 44:07.768
the trial, after everything
he's put me through?

44:09.220 --> 44:11.848
-I'm sorry.
-But again, maybe he has a point.

44:13.770 --> 44:19.857
Think I had this fantasy that I was going
to tell Hannah's story to the world.

44:20.990 --> 44:24.869
Make them understand.
CertaInly aren't gettIng It In court.

44:26.120 --> 44:26.984
No.

44:30.410 --> 44:31.570
Although, Jessica...

44:34.580 --> 44:36.741
I think she did her best. Don't you?

44:38.210 --> 44:40.121
Yeah. Yeah.

44:41.590 --> 44:42.409
I think she did.

44:44.590 --> 44:46.501
She's the girl on the tape,
isn't she, Tony?

44:46.600 --> 44:49.672
She's the one on tape nine?
Is she afraid of Bryce Walker?

44:49.770 --> 44:52.056
Is she afraid no one will believe her?
Why won't she come forward?

44:52.140 --> 44:54.688
Yeah, I have to ask you.
Why do you need her to?

44:55.730 --> 44:58.722
She only knows what happened to her,
she doesn't know what happened to Hannah.

44:58.820 --> 45:01.857
'Cause Hannah isn't here to speak
to what happened to her.

45:01.940 --> 45:04.943
I mean, you're right, it may or may not
help our case against the school.

45:05.030 --> 45:09.069
But Tony, it could help build
a criminal case against Bryce.

45:12.250 --> 45:15.242
The cops, they already have the tapes.

45:15.330 --> 45:16.570
They won't act on anything

45:16.670 --> 45:20.128
unless they have a living victim
to tell her story.

45:20.340 --> 45:22.160
And it's gotta come out in court?

45:22.670 --> 45:28.791
Dennis says we need a witness
who can speak to a pattern of behavior.

45:29.760 --> 45:32.558
It could lead to an arrest, Tony.

45:33.730 --> 45:36.187
Bryce needs to pay
for what he did to Hannah,

45:37.020 --> 45:40.399
to Jessica,
to who knows how many other girls.

45:41.280 --> 45:42.770
I want it to come out.

45:42.860 --> 45:46.489
In court, in a sheriff's office,
I don't care where.

45:48.120 --> 45:51.237
And Jessica is the only one who can speak
to what happened that night.

45:55.250 --> 45:56.114
And Justin.

45:58.170 --> 45:59.239
Do you know where he is?

46:00.670 --> 46:02.956
I can ask around for him again.

46:03.050 --> 46:06.338
I mean, I have a friend
who might be able to track him down.

46:08.890 --> 46:11.381
-I'm sorry, okay?
-[Mr. Standall] Sorry isn't gonna cut it.

46:11.470 --> 46:15.099
You haven't even been back less than
a week and you're already skipping school.

46:15.180 --> 46:17.557
[Mrs. Standall]
Okay, Bill, every 17-year-old kid

46:17.640 --> 46:20.268
skips a couple of classes now and then.

46:20.360 --> 46:23.022
[Bill] Well, if he's ever gonna be
a normal 17-year-old kid again,

46:23.110 --> 46:24.600
he's gotta put in the work, that's all.

46:24.690 --> 46:25.930
I'm sorry I'm not fucking normal!

46:26.030 --> 46:27.986
-[Mrs. Standall] Language!
-I know that's hard for you.

46:28.070 --> 46:30.118
[Bill]
That's not what I'm talking about, kid!

46:31.410 --> 46:32.650
Alex!

46:32.740 --> 46:34.196
[footsteps leaving]

46:37.000 --> 46:39.116
-Honey.
-[sighs]

46:39.210 --> 46:42.031
You need to ease up on him.
He's trying, okay?

46:42.130 --> 46:45.418
Well, he needs to try harder.
'Cause he's got to get better.

46:46.970 --> 46:48.255
He has to get better.

46:49.590 --> 46:51.046
If he doesn't...

46:52.800 --> 46:57.305
If this is as far as he gets,
you've got to stop blaming yourself.

46:57.640 --> 46:58.595
Why?

46:59.440 --> 47:00.429
It was my gun.

47:07.400 --> 47:08.276
[exhales]

47:10.610 --> 47:12.658
Fuck!Fuck!

47:12.990 --> 47:14.116
[grunts]

47:15.910 --> 47:17.537
[panﬁng]

47:28.840 --> 47:30.967
[sobs]

47:49.490 --> 47:50.525
Come on, Clay.

47:59.910 --> 48:01.707
[sobs]

48:01.790 --> 48:04.031
[Marcus]
Too many kids still feel powerless.

48:36.660 --> 48:37.524
Jesus.

48:42.250 --> 48:44.627
_ _ Marcus Cole turned_
Into a nIce surprIse today, dIdn't he?

48:45.250 --> 48:47.741
Yeah, I am not sure why Dennis thought
he would be good for them,

48:47.840 --> 48:49.046
with that kind of story to tell.

48:49.630 --> 48:52.372
Do you think he had that story to tell
before today?

48:53.720 --> 48:57.133
I think he was quite credible.

48:57.680 --> 49:00.808
Well, hearing Bryce's name sure took
the attention away from the school.

49:01.220 --> 49:02.972
Yeah, it's great for us.

49:03.980 --> 49:08.269
These kids, Sonya, teenagers,
they, uh, they have secrets.

49:09.190 --> 49:10.851
They know more than they say,

49:10.940 --> 49:13.317
and they're very good at telling you
the story you want them to.

49:13.530 --> 49:15.566
I've examined teenagers before.

49:17.370 --> 49:18.769
But you haven't lived with them.

49:20.330 --> 49:23.322
-In case you need any advice--
-A witness is a witness.

49:24.410 --> 49:26.708
But thanks, Lainie. I appreciate it.

49:31.300 --> 49:32.198
Good night.

49:36.180 --> 49:38.341
[door opening, closing]

50:14.510 --> 50:16.375
[Marcus] Hannah made a bad decision.

50:16.840 --> 50:19.331
She acted out of sadness. Anger.

50:19.800 --> 50:21.961
And I just don't want anyone else
to get hurt.

50:48.460 --> 50:50.667
[Hannah]
Are you sure Alex should hear the tapes?

50:53.420 --> 50:55.661
Odd question coming from the person
who made them.

50:56.420 --> 50:58.672
You were trying to protect him.

50:59.840 --> 51:02.718
If he can remember enough,
they might let him testify.

51:02.970 --> 51:04.926
-Testify about what?
-About Bryce.

51:05.850 --> 51:07.841
The trial's not about Bryce.

51:08.810 --> 51:10.971
Well, it should be.

51:12.980 --> 51:14.436
That girl's unconscious.

51:15.900 --> 51:17.686
You should show these to someone.
Turn mm In.

51:17.860 --> 51:21.273
And say what? "I found this Polaroid
in my locker, arrest him?"

51:22.160 --> 51:24.321
I got his confession and they did nothing.

51:25.120 --> 51:27.657
-Find the girl.
-We can't see her face.

51:27.950 --> 51:30.783
Find the room.
The couch is the same in both pictures.

51:30.870 --> 51:32.826
Nothing I do is going to make
any difference.

51:33.170 --> 51:35.912
Someone has to say something about Bryce
that makes them pay attention.

51:36.300 --> 51:39.622
Jessica couldn't do it,
they won't let me, maybe Alex can.

51:39.840 --> 51:42.718
Or maybe it will destroy him
all over again.

51:43.640 --> 51:44.595
Was Marcus lying?

51:45.930 --> 51:49.479
Tell me. If he was lying,
we need someone to tell the truth.

51:53.690 --> 51:55.897
Things like this
are gonna keep happening, Clay.

51:58.610 --> 52:01.147
You heard my story
the way I wanted it to be told,

52:01.240 --> 52:04.061
but there's always another side
to every story.

52:05.870 --> 52:07.110
How do I know what's true?

52:09.250 --> 52:11.286
You know me, right?

52:14.170 --> 52:15.159
I thought I did.

52:17.630 --> 52:18.949
Then do the right thing.

52:25.260 --> 52:26.249
Iam.

52:46.120 --> 52:49.999
[Marcus] But I believe we're turning
a corner. It's getting better.

52:57.710 --> 52:58.916
[cell phone beeps]

53:18.320 --> 53:21.562
[Hannah] Hey. It's Hannah. Hannah Baker.

53:23.360 --> 53:27.148
Don't adjust your...
whatever device you're hearing this on.

53:28.620 --> 53:32.192
It's me, live and in stereo.

53:41.760 --> 53:43.830
