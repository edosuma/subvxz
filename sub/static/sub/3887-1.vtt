01:25.785 --> 01:29.055
You liked fucking my wife?
Tell me, fucknuts!

Is your cock that big?

Just kill yourself!

You got no respect
for the porridge

07:27.280 --> 07:28.407
Why are you here?

07:28.848 --> 07:31.147
What's wrong with
a son coming home?

07:32.985 --> 07:39.289
It is, when a big shot director
comes by during the day

07:51.437 --> 07:53.872
A big boy now, eh?

07:55.208 --> 07:57.837
Came to get a taste of my fist?

08:03.082 --> 08:04.015
Eat it

08:04.750 --> 08:06.819
- Piss off
- Eat it and beat it

Fuck off, eat this shit
and beat it

08:20.299 --> 08:21.130
Goddammit!

08:22.268 --> 08:23.600
You fuck off

08:23.836 --> 08:26.906
My precious drumstick!
You're so dead

08:26.906 --> 08:28.774
That's it, dickhead!

08:28.774 --> 08:33.006
I've missed beating you up
for a few years

08:33.946 --> 08:35.505
Come on!

08:35.948 --> 08:37.883
That all you got?

08:42.455 --> 08:46.025
Feel that, feel it,
you pussy!

08:46.025 --> 08:47.059
Cut!

08:47.059 --> 08:50.429
Cut, cut, okay,
that's enough

08:50.429 --> 08:51.998
Fuck you, asshole

Ready, action, bitch!

08:54.400 --> 08:55.732
Stop...

Let go! Let go!

09:01.140 --> 09:02.335
Let go, dammit!

09:03.809 --> 09:05.177
Goddamn you!

09:05.177 --> 09:06.475
What's going on?

09:09.448 --> 09:10.074
Mom!

09:11.083 --> 09:14.220
In-mo wants to move back in,
let's kick him out together

09:14.220 --> 09:16.086
He can't come between us!

09:17.123 --> 09:21.260
We got room,
what's wrong with that?

09:21.260 --> 09:23.786
Go take a bath

09:26.132 --> 09:27.225
You too

09:33.706 --> 09:34.730
Gimme $10 more

09:35.875 --> 09:36.774
Me too

10:19.251 --> 10:22.915
Look at that,
a wave of dead skin

10:23.756 --> 10:25.156
Then...

10:28.961 --> 10:30.725
So fucking disgusting

10:35.434 --> 10:38.461
I said scrub, not caress

10:39.605 --> 10:40.873
Allow me to demonstrate

10:40.873 --> 10:43.175
- It's okay
- Turn around, turn

10:43.175 --> 10:44.768
I don't want it, forget it!

10:46.612 --> 10:48.911
Want me to finish
what I started earlier?

10:49.915 --> 10:52.578
I'm Oh Han-mo,
you little shit

10:54.987 --> 11:00.517
Scrubbing is like
handling a woman

11:01.594 --> 11:04.189
Short thrust first,
then a deep one!

11:04.797 --> 11:06.561
Fuck! Goddamn it!

11:15.775 --> 11:16.708
Nice!

11:22.581 --> 11:25.949
This is some funny shit!

11:27.186 --> 11:28.882
Holy shit

11:30.623 --> 11:31.647
Hello?

11:48.607 --> 11:51.577
Are you lost, little girl?

11:51.577 --> 11:53.876
This is my grandma's place

11:54.013 --> 11:56.382
Grandma? Which one?

11:56.382 --> 11:58.217
Mom's side

11:58.217 --> 12:01.187
What a fucking dipshit

12:08.094 --> 12:09.653
You must be Mi-yun's kid

12:09.929 --> 12:13.058
Go bother someone else
if you finally get it

12:13.165 --> 12:17.261
You're like a clone
of your mother

12:17.603 --> 12:20.163
Is this how you treat
your uncle?

12:20.339 --> 12:23.036
Where's your school?
Who's the ethics teacher?

12:26.946 --> 12:28.539
Hey, mister

12:29.181 --> 12:31.207
'Hey, mister'?
Yes, miss?

12:32.985 --> 12:34.715
Do you know me?

12:34.954 --> 12:37.321
What's my name?

12:37.790 --> 12:40.123
Uncle of the year,
right here

12:45.397 --> 12:46.956
Why are you here?

12:47.233 --> 12:49.702
Mom said
we're gonna live here

12:50.603 --> 12:54.233
What?
Live here? Why?

12:54.306 --> 12:57.003
I dunno! Go ask mom!

12:59.945 --> 13:03.211
I don't care, it's over,
I'm done talking about it

13:03.282 --> 13:05.317
Grow up already

13:05.317 --> 13:08.845
If you divorce Jang,
it'll be your second

13:08.954 --> 13:11.355
I don't care,
I can't live like this

13:11.423 --> 13:14.791
Listen to mom,
you're being too extreme

13:14.894 --> 13:17.454
'Extreme'?
Did I hear you right?

13:18.130 --> 13:22.067
Look at this,
say that to my bruise

13:23.035 --> 13:26.705
I'm saying,
by being reasonable,

13:26.705 --> 13:28.207
you could avoid
an extreme situation

13:28.207 --> 13:31.744
If you're so reasonable,
then why did you split up?

13:31.744 --> 13:33.045
Tell me

13:33.045 --> 13:36.379
This isn't about him,
it's about you

13:36.448 --> 13:37.916
Forget it, it's over

13:37.983 --> 13:41.215
I'm gonna live like a monk
from now on

13:44.190 --> 13:47.426
I was laughing at the TV

13:47.426 --> 13:48.223
Missy

13:49.228 --> 13:50.629
Go do your homework!

13:50.629 --> 13:52.598
Your grammar's terrible,
it's embarrassing!

13:52.665 --> 13:55.794
There's just no room for
the two of you to stay

13:56.302 --> 13:57.292
That room will do

13:57.469 --> 13:59.131
It's already taken!

13:59.238 --> 14:01.298
You two can share,
what's the problem?

14:01.407 --> 14:03.137
What? Are you serious?

14:03.209 --> 14:04.336
Where's that idiot?

14:04.410 --> 14:05.537
What the hell for?

14:06.712 --> 14:07.907
I said do your homework!

14:08.080 --> 14:11.676
This lil prick has
no responsibility whatsoever

14:11.917 --> 14:13.647
- Come on already!
- Okay!

14:14.386 --> 14:15.410
Where you going?

14:17.590 --> 14:19.218
What the hell

14:23.095 --> 14:23.960
Go study!

14:24.063 --> 14:25.463
Cheers!

14:28.467 --> 14:30.732
- Empty, empty
- Empty, empty

14:30.903 --> 14:32.337
Empty, empty

14:33.405 --> 14:36.000
Jang, you made the right call

14:36.642 --> 14:40.112
Drink this and take Mi-yun
and Min-kyung home

14:40.112 --> 14:41.136
Yes, of course

14:43.215 --> 14:44.550
They belong in our
sweet home

14:44.550 --> 14:49.921
I'm gonna, smack you,
yeah, don't forget it

14:50.022 --> 14:52.184
No, sir, I won't forget

14:52.625 --> 14:56.494
She's got bad blood in her,
that fucking bitch

15:01.133 --> 15:04.467
Yo, what did you just say?

15:04.603 --> 15:06.629
- What?
- Jang

15:07.006 --> 15:09.134
You just walked the plank

15:10.142 --> 15:12.168
I did?

15:21.120 --> 15:26.457
<i>The loneliness,</i>

15:27.660 --> 15:30.528

15:31.830 --> 15:35.858

15:38.570 --> 15:42.374
- Come on, get out!
- One sec!

15:42.374 --> 15:44.240
Hurry, I gotta go!

15:45.210 --> 15:46.303
Seriously!

15:48.080 --> 15:49.946
Why the heck
are you screaming?

15:50.015 --> 15:52.416
Wouldn't you?!

15:53.819 --> 15:55.151
That son of a!

15:56.922 --> 15:59.224
What are you doing
in front of my kid!

15:59.224 --> 16:00.359
Go to your room!

16:00.359 --> 16:01.054
You too!

16:04.029 --> 16:05.554
I told you

16:05.831 --> 16:07.857
Staying here won't do
your kid any good

16:09.768 --> 16:12.604
Is this human or animal?

16:12.604 --> 16:14.664
Settle down and let's eat

16:32.324 --> 16:34.555
That worthless bitch

16:38.664 --> 16:40.895
What now?

16:41.400 --> 16:42.493
Gimme a smoke

16:46.638 --> 16:48.106
Light too

16:54.413 --> 16:56.075
What do you want?!

17:00.686 --> 17:02.348
Dude, let's be friends

17:04.323 --> 17:05.758
What the fuck for?

17:05.758 --> 17:09.661
I'm talking about
an alliance, asshole

17:09.661 --> 17:11.755
Do you even know
what that means?

17:13.632 --> 17:17.669
She's looking down on us
'cos she's making some dough

17:17.669 --> 17:19.934
Let's join forces against her

17:20.372 --> 17:22.034
Like sleeping with me?

17:23.142 --> 17:23.768
You think?

17:23.842 --> 17:30.349
See? We gotta team up
until she moves out

17:30.349 --> 17:31.248
Okay?

17:36.055 --> 17:39.324
Alliance is all about teamwork

17:39.324 --> 17:40.792
- Is that so?
- Yeah

17:52.871 --> 17:55.272
Shit, that's nasty

17:56.575 --> 17:59.010
Nice mouth for a student

17:59.244 --> 18:01.475
So why did you fart?
It's nasty

18:01.680 --> 18:03.549
It's natural, don't you fart?

18:03.549 --> 18:05.651
- Never
- Really?

18:05.651 --> 18:07.552
I'm gonna
keep a nose on you

18:11.056 --> 18:12.354
Pizza delivery!

18:18.497 --> 18:19.430
Hello

18:20.799 --> 18:22.062
Pizza?

18:22.401 --> 18:23.391
Your soda

18:24.837 --> 18:27.636
And the pizza,
it comes to $20

18:30.375 --> 18:30.976
Here you are

18:30.976 --> 18:32.069
Bon appetit!

18:52.064 --> 18:54.465
Can you eat all that?

18:56.101 --> 18:57.763
Isn't it too much?

18:58.570 --> 19:02.337
Keep it up
and you'll get this too

19:04.843 --> 19:08.439
Get off my case
and order it yourself

19:31.036 --> 19:31.969
Min-kyung

19:32.938 --> 19:37.467
Can I get a slice
if I show you something funny?

19:37.776 --> 19:38.835
Depends

19:39.912 --> 19:44.976
Alright, I'm gonna make
a foghorn sound

19:45.317 --> 19:46.910
Promise me a slice

19:52.324 --> 19:53.348
Fail!

19:53.592 --> 19:55.527
Not even close

19:55.661 --> 19:59.564
I learned it from a comedian,
listen to it again

20:03.202 --> 20:06.468
Stop it!
That's not a foghorn

20:08.540 --> 20:09.940
Yo, brat!

20:10.642 --> 20:13.145
Have you heard a real foghorn?

20:13.145 --> 20:14.146
I haven't

20:14.146 --> 20:18.379
Then how could you objectively
decide if it's similar or not?

20:19.017 --> 20:24.183
If you don't want to share,
just say so, you didn't have to lie

20:24.456 --> 20:27.824
Can I not eat in peace
in this house?

20:28.026 --> 20:34.694
We're not after your pizza,
it's for the sake of your education

20:34.900 --> 20:36.766
I swear on my father's grave,

20:37.869 --> 20:40.572
it was better than the real thing

20:40.572 --> 20:45.811
If you weren't gonna share,
you should've said so

20:45.811 --> 20:48.440
He made a fool of himself
for nothing

20:48.647 --> 20:53.585
Maybe it wasn't
up to her standards

20:53.585 --> 20:54.686
It was perfect, goddammit

20:54.686 --> 20:56.622
Take it easy, let it go

20:56.622 --> 21:01.793
You may not believe it,
but I don't want to eat this

21:01.793 --> 21:06.731
I'm scolding you to
teach you a valuable lesson

21:15.207 --> 21:16.573
Who's that crying?

21:16.708 --> 21:18.438
Grandma!

21:18.510 --> 21:19.671
Why? What's wrong?

21:19.845 --> 21:21.177
Uncles...

21:21.413 --> 21:25.180
In-Mo chewed her out
for eating pizza alone

21:25.350 --> 21:26.852
Don't cry, honey

21:26.852 --> 21:31.119
Food should be
shared with the family

21:40.866 --> 21:43.035
In-mo, why aren't you eating?

21:43.035 --> 21:46.995
That's why you're so skinny!

21:48.640 --> 21:50.609
You sure favor one son
over another!

21:51.643 --> 21:52.372
Here!

21:53.879 --> 21:57.883
You idiot, how are you
the same as him?

21:57.883 --> 22:00.652
He's our only college graduate

22:00.652 --> 22:02.621
And you got out of prison

22:02.621 --> 22:04.556
I learned a lot there

22:04.656 --> 22:06.249
Good for you, seriously

22:08.026 --> 22:12.589
Mom, I don't like pork,
but this is really good

22:12.664 --> 22:13.598
- Yeah?
- Totally

22:13.598 --> 22:14.666
Have some more

22:14.666 --> 22:18.036
Mom, weren't you gonna
live like a monk?

22:18.036 --> 22:20.205
You shouldn't eat meat

22:20.205 --> 22:23.408
Live like a monk here,
but not here

22:23.408 --> 22:25.570
You mean your crotch,
not your head

22:25.777 --> 22:27.541
Are you insane?!

22:28.547 --> 22:31.107
I'm gonna rip
your mouth open!

22:31.283 --> 22:35.287
You sure can talk
for a Neanderthal

22:35.287 --> 22:40.992
And if you steal money
from my purse, I'll skin you

22:40.992 --> 22:41.891
Mi-yun!

22:43.061 --> 22:46.293
Watch what you say
in front of mom

22:46.865 --> 22:48.333
Careful what you say

22:51.670 --> 22:54.706
Who's to say Min-kyung
won't sneer at you later?

22:54.706 --> 22:56.538
She's a fast learner

22:56.675 --> 22:57.142
Fine

22:57.142 --> 22:58.977
You had to drag me into this?

22:58.977 --> 23:00.138
I'm sorry, eat

23:06.118 --> 23:09.611
There's plenty of meat,
eat all you want

23:11.957 --> 23:14.859
4 facial, 4 body,
and 3 cream, right?

23:15.861 --> 23:18.353
- Take care
- Good bye

23:22.167 --> 23:23.760
Who's that dope?

23:24.736 --> 23:29.341
That dope is
#202's second son

23:29.341 --> 23:33.779
He must be the one who started
a business and went bust

23:33.779 --> 23:37.416
He lost everything to
a movie or something,

23:37.416 --> 23:39.317
but we didn't see it,
so who knows

23:39.317 --> 23:42.654
He coulda wasted it all
in a whorehouse

23:42.654 --> 23:45.724
He looks just the part,
like a whore-loving idiot

23:45.724 --> 23:49.593
But he's better than
their first son

23:49.795 --> 23:53.365
He's total trash for sure

23:53.365 --> 23:56.201
He's been to the prison
countless times

23:56.201 --> 23:58.003
That's so frightening

23:58.003 --> 24:02.774
He should be locked up
in chains now,

24:02.774 --> 24:06.411
but he convinced them
for a temporary release

24:06.411 --> 24:08.013
He's gonna go back soon

24:08.013 --> 24:10.312
What a messed up family

24:27.265 --> 24:29.063
Is that so hard?

24:47.986 --> 24:50.581
You look similar to someone

24:51.289 --> 24:52.222
I do?

24:52.390 --> 24:55.554
I have this
regular customer

24:55.794 --> 24:57.695
Right? His brother?

24:59.297 --> 25:00.890
I don't know what you mean

25:00.999 --> 25:03.400
Are you the movie director?

25:04.503 --> 25:05.527
Yes

25:05.770 --> 25:10.834
So you're his younger brother,
I'm honored

25:11.243 --> 25:13.769
I'll make an extra effort

25:28.393 --> 25:31.158
But I heard your movie failed

25:36.468 --> 25:37.663
He said that?

25:37.869 --> 25:42.705
Yes, that you did well,
but the actor ruined it

25:42.908 --> 25:45.605
He said you're back home
to write a script

25:45.710 --> 25:47.975
What's the script about?

25:48.179 --> 25:51.082
Well, you know

25:51.082 --> 25:52.482
Do you play the guitar?

25:53.752 --> 25:57.450
I just started learning,
I'm not very good

25:59.024 --> 26:00.492
I play a little

26:00.725 --> 26:05.129
Directors really are different

26:05.297 --> 26:07.357
You're an artist

26:16.908 --> 26:18.809
Make sure I can use it too

26:21.346 --> 26:23.679
Sorry, boss,
force of habit

26:26.851 --> 26:28.520
Don't be so petty, idiot

26:28.520 --> 26:31.456
You robbed diamonds
from a congressman

26:31.623 --> 26:34.183
Now you steal cheap lighters?

26:34.392 --> 26:37.794
When we shared a cell
how many times did I tell you?

26:37.929 --> 26:39.795
A man's gotta play big

26:40.165 --> 26:44.068
It's a tough habit to break,
you know

26:48.139 --> 26:50.131
Son of a bitch

26:51.109 --> 26:52.042
<i>Bud, it's me</i>

26:52.110 --> 26:53.345
Yo, pill pusher

26:53.345 --> 26:54.438
<i>Been well?</i>

26:59.851 --> 27:01.547
Avoiding my calls, eh?

27:01.653 --> 27:04.384
'Pill pusher'?
Bring me Oh Han-mo

27:04.623 --> 27:06.387
Didn't he retire?

27:06.458 --> 27:09.951
He still got a dick,
and no one easier to handle

27:10.028 --> 27:12.263
He's perfect for
our straw owner

27:12.263 --> 27:13.094
Okay, boss

27:13.798 --> 27:14.822
Good afternoon, boss

27:14.966 --> 27:16.832
- Everything okay?
- No problem, boss

27:17.936 --> 27:19.097
You shouldn't...

27:19.804 --> 27:22.433
Never answer his call

27:23.575 --> 27:24.440
Let's go

27:25.343 --> 27:27.938
But you should still hear him out

27:34.853 --> 27:35.650
Ma'am

27:39.124 --> 27:40.752
- Thanks you
- Bye

27:47.499 --> 27:49.968
Where did your brother go?

27:50.168 --> 27:52.000
I hope he doesn't starve himself

27:52.404 --> 27:54.566
He'll never starve to death

27:58.677 --> 28:02.136
By the way,
how much do you make?

28:03.314 --> 28:04.441
Why?

28:05.283 --> 28:06.581
Just asking

28:06.751 --> 28:10.586
Wondering how you can
afford so much meat

28:11.589 --> 28:14.991
Don't you worry,
eat as much as you can

28:28.106 --> 28:29.005
What?

28:34.079 --> 28:38.483
Who cut your hair?
Ruined my boy

28:42.987 --> 28:45.547
What's everyone doing so late?

28:51.296 --> 28:53.629
A moment, please?

28:54.065 --> 28:55.966
Looks like a rape-in-progress

29:03.708 --> 29:06.678
Geun-bae, what's with you!

29:06.678 --> 29:09.180
You're so pretty

29:09.180 --> 29:11.616
We're in front of my house!

29:11.616 --> 29:14.415
- It's alright
- Are you nuts?

29:14.853 --> 29:16.253
Motherfucker!

29:28.566 --> 29:30.330
She's trying to
live like a monk

29:30.435 --> 29:31.536
Han-mo!

29:31.536 --> 29:32.604
How dare you seduce her?

29:32.604 --> 29:35.699
- You got it all wrong!
- Stay back!

29:43.748 --> 29:45.216
That ignorant fuck!

29:53.391 --> 29:54.689
Are you alright?

29:55.126 --> 29:55.752
No

29:58.897 --> 30:01.799
I've had it with you

30:01.900 --> 30:04.096
Always causing

30:04.335 --> 30:05.735
trouble and shit!

30:05.937 --> 30:06.905
What happened?!

30:07.272 --> 30:09.264
Good evening, ma'am!

30:11.109 --> 30:13.806
Your brick was
your own downfall

30:14.145 --> 30:15.477
Nicely done

30:15.613 --> 30:19.243
Who 'da thunk
she'd do me like this

30:19.450 --> 30:21.112
Way of the monk?

30:21.719 --> 30:24.211
What did you expect?
Let's drop it!

30:25.557 --> 30:28.049
Look at the bruise
on his neck!

30:28.793 --> 30:32.025
It's quite alright,
he didn't know

30:33.264 --> 30:35.256
So you work in insurance?

30:35.466 --> 30:37.867
Yes, it's my calling in life

30:38.770 --> 30:40.261
And your parents?

30:41.673 --> 30:44.268
They passed away
when I was young

30:45.143 --> 30:46.133
He's an orphan

30:48.780 --> 30:51.181
You look so honorable

30:53.885 --> 30:57.686
In-mo, got anything
you want to ask him?

30:58.590 --> 31:00.081
Let me ask you this

31:00.358 --> 31:03.351
Did you end it properly
with Jang?

31:04.162 --> 31:06.893
You two did that for me
with a brick

31:08.433 --> 31:10.493
This is it for me

31:10.802 --> 31:12.464
Geun-bae knows everything

31:14.038 --> 31:15.404
I'm so sorry, ma'am

31:15.573 --> 31:18.304
Let's forget this little incident

31:18.443 --> 31:20.571
You have my consent

31:21.312 --> 31:25.079
Like hell, who asked you?

31:25.884 --> 31:27.250
Thank you sir!

31:27.919 --> 31:29.888
So messed up, really

31:30.021 --> 31:31.683
This family's gone to hell

31:33.491 --> 31:34.425
Welcome

31:34.425 --> 31:37.020
My baby's home,
Min-kyung!

31:37.428 --> 31:39.920
This is my boyfriend, Geun-bae

31:40.398 --> 31:41.798
Hi, Min-kyung!

31:45.403 --> 31:48.805
Mom, I wish you'd use
your head for once

31:55.880 --> 31:57.439
It hurts...

32:00.351 --> 32:02.115
What are you reading?

32:02.754 --> 32:04.689
You won't even understand

32:05.590 --> 32:06.888
Assfucker

32:11.062 --> 32:14.089
New haircut?
Which barber?

32:14.966 --> 32:17.128
Do I have to report
my life to you?

32:18.569 --> 32:20.333
Rude fucker

32:21.406 --> 32:27.209
Doesn't that new asshole
seem better than Jang?

32:28.479 --> 32:31.677
She doesn't know
when to give it a rest

32:32.517 --> 32:36.818
Girls are about timing,
knowing when to drop their panties

32:37.088 --> 32:40.354
Mi-yun's born with that talent,
she's a genius

32:40.625 --> 32:41.854
What about men?

32:42.527 --> 32:44.295
Men?

32:44.295 --> 32:46.526
Strong stomach,
that's all we need

32:49.300 --> 32:52.270
Maybe I should start over

32:53.471 --> 32:54.939
Like Mi-yun

32:59.711 --> 33:00.906
Seriously?!

33:01.012 --> 33:02.480
Lights out, asshole

33:02.480 --> 33:05.507
- What did you eat?!
- Dumplings

33:16.294 --> 33:18.627
- Su-ja, I brought dumplings
- Hello there

33:18.696 --> 33:20.562
- Let's eat
- Okay

33:21.299 --> 33:24.497
He's got an artistic eye,
it's beautiful

33:24.669 --> 33:25.830
Give him a chance

33:26.170 --> 33:28.071
Sure, that's really important

33:28.239 --> 33:30.441
Alright, check this out

33:30.441 --> 33:31.309
It's our next project

33:31.309 --> 33:31.901
<i>Rosy Milf</i>

33:33.177 --> 33:34.873
Nice eh? Very rosy

33:38.149 --> 33:40.914
What, you're not feeling it?

33:42.053 --> 33:46.753
Mr. Choi, you said he directs
beautiful sex scenes

33:47.291 --> 33:49.988
Doesn't look like
he's feeling it

33:50.128 --> 33:53.860
Of course he does,
he's just shy, that's all

33:53.931 --> 33:58.631
No, that's not it,
he doesn't feel it at all

33:58.770 --> 33:59.863
He's stiff

34:00.638 --> 34:02.300
Think carefully now

34:02.540 --> 34:06.636
Out of work directors are
a dime a dozen

34:08.379 --> 34:09.505
One moment

34:12.850 --> 34:15.513
Asshole, where are you?

34:21.426 --> 34:22.553
Have a drink

34:23.027 --> 34:25.393
Forget it, shit,
I won't make porn

34:27.331 --> 34:30.768
People brought up poor
at least got the will to work,

34:30.768 --> 34:32.600
but you lack even that

34:32.870 --> 34:34.600
Goddammit

34:34.772 --> 34:37.036
You gotta eat first

34:37.975 --> 34:41.002
Honestly, who'll give you
money to shoot anything?

34:41.379 --> 34:43.507
Don't bother calling me
if this is all you got

34:44.815 --> 34:46.580
That stubbornness of yours

34:53.224 --> 34:55.159
- Mom
- Yeah?

34:55.226 --> 34:57.627
The meat's not that great today

34:57.762 --> 35:01.790
You pig, you shoved
all that meat in your face

35:01.933 --> 35:04.562
Watch your mouth

35:04.802 --> 35:07.071
Why are you on my case?

35:07.071 --> 35:09.674
Meat always tastes better
on a barbecue

35:09.674 --> 35:11.199
It's different

35:11.275 --> 35:14.579
Mom, remember our picnic
at the park?

35:14.579 --> 35:17.139
Those were the days

35:17.515 --> 35:20.651
Flower petals in the air,
meat sizzling,

35:20.651 --> 35:23.821
young Mi-yun dancing
and singing for us,

35:23.821 --> 35:26.757
In-mo was in his own world
with a book,

35:26.757 --> 35:29.750
and dad was in the mood,
gulping down soju

35:30.928 --> 35:31.657
Daddy!

35:33.364 --> 35:35.993
Our poor dad

35:36.267 --> 35:39.396
Where are you? Daddy!

35:39.570 --> 35:42.335
- Having fun?
- Was that good?

35:44.509 --> 35:47.069
- Go put on a show
- Go put on a show

35:48.112 --> 35:51.913
Let's do it,
I wanna have a picnic

36:01.993 --> 36:05.589
Aren't we breaking several
traffic laws?

36:05.830 --> 36:07.565
I'm sorry for bothering you

36:07.565 --> 36:09.431
It's my pleasure, mother

36:10.434 --> 36:12.733
Is our Min-kyung comfy?

36:12.970 --> 36:14.672
Stop saying 'our',
we're not family yet

36:14.672 --> 36:16.908
Will you just go along?

36:16.908 --> 36:18.103
Where are we heading?

36:18.276 --> 36:20.677
There's a beach in Eulwang

36:20.778 --> 36:21.905
Oh, there

36:29.120 --> 36:30.486
He looks mentally ill

36:33.424 --> 36:35.450
It's cold, let's leave

36:35.826 --> 36:37.728
We came this far

36:37.728 --> 36:39.163
Hey, stop!

36:39.163 --> 36:41.530
Let's go, come on

36:44.902 --> 36:46.632
Ready! Action!

36:49.373 --> 36:50.568
Geun-bae, kick his ass!

36:52.009 --> 36:53.375
Geun-bae, no!

36:56.948 --> 36:59.383
No, Han-mo!

37:04.455 --> 37:06.023
Alright, ready?

37:06.023 --> 37:07.685
In-mo, a little closer

37:09.227 --> 37:10.828
Please smile a little

37:10.828 --> 37:12.626
Min-kyung, wide smile

37:12.930 --> 37:13.920
Very good!

37:14.065 --> 37:16.432
Okay, one, two, three!

37:19.070 --> 37:20.800
<i>Must I take you
to court over this?</i>

37:21.005 --> 37:23.031
- Let's drop it
<i>- It's been 3 years!</i>

37:23.174 --> 37:27.111
What you mean is, you're
free physically but not legally,

37:27.111 --> 37:29.137
- is that it?
<i>- That's it</i>

37:29.280 --> 37:31.010
- Suh Mi-ok
<i>- So sick of this</i>

37:31.115 --> 37:33.641
Let's live like human beings

37:39.390 --> 37:42.292
- Just one drink?
- No, I have to drive

37:46.063 --> 37:47.895
In-mo, why aren't you drinking?

37:48.065 --> 37:50.034
Pride of our family,
take it

37:51.269 --> 37:53.568
What's with the sour face?

37:54.805 --> 37:57.141
One shot, one shot!

37:57.141 --> 37:58.200
Down it!

38:01.712 --> 38:03.305
- Here
- Forget it

38:03.414 --> 38:05.178
Come on, eat

38:07.518 --> 38:09.578
Oops, I'm so sorry

38:10.288 --> 38:12.018
Goddammit!

38:16.294 --> 38:20.857
It's no big deal,
you didn't have to swear

38:22.133 --> 38:23.863
What's with you today?

38:23.968 --> 38:26.199
Today was for our family

38:27.238 --> 38:28.399
Just drop it

38:28.472 --> 38:31.203
Drop what?
After shaming me like that?

38:31.309 --> 38:34.336
We're in public,
it's embarrassing

38:34.545 --> 38:38.073
Let's go home,
you all drank too much

38:38.482 --> 38:41.975
'Embarrassing'?
Mom, we embarrass him

38:42.186 --> 38:44.246
You can't treat us this way

38:44.455 --> 38:50.258
You alone went to college,
and that makes you a god?

38:50.328 --> 38:53.127
You became what you are
by stepping all over us

38:53.297 --> 38:56.426
This isn't the place for this!

38:56.567 --> 38:58.502
It's the truth

38:58.569 --> 39:03.174
You and dad supported him
because he's got the brain

39:03.174 --> 39:06.010
So what?
What came of it?

39:06.010 --> 39:10.414
Did you do our family any good
or become famous?

39:11.082 --> 39:13.117
Your movie bombing

39:13.117 --> 39:15.319
brought us nothing but
your arrogance, why's that?

39:15.319 --> 39:16.687
Shut your mouth!

39:16.687 --> 39:19.023
I can't! Tell me!

39:19.023 --> 39:19.890
Mi-yun

39:19.890 --> 39:23.520
Be a little understanding,
he's in a tough spot

39:23.828 --> 39:26.059
I contribute the most
to this family

39:26.197 --> 39:29.065
Have you done anything for us?
Even once?

39:29.567 --> 39:31.160
- Tell me
- Wait a minute

39:31.602 --> 39:33.637
I don't fucking believe it

39:33.637 --> 39:37.675
You don't have any right
to criticize my failure

39:37.675 --> 39:41.779
Just because you throw
some pennies at mom,

39:41.779 --> 39:45.182
you think you can
boss everyone around?

39:45.182 --> 39:47.117
Did you say pennies?

39:47.685 --> 39:49.677
Mom, did you hear this asshole?

39:49.787 --> 39:51.312
Pennies, he said

39:51.489 --> 39:52.957
'Asshole'?

39:53.524 --> 39:58.792
I get stepped on by the world,
even by my bitch of a sister

39:59.029 --> 40:03.023
Did you just call me a bitch?
Did I hear you right?

40:03.367 --> 40:07.838
Excuse me,
could you keep it down?

40:07.838 --> 40:08.806
Let 'em be

40:08.806 --> 40:10.866
It's not like
you own this joint, right?

40:13.077 --> 40:17.606
Yeah? Mind your own
fucking business

40:17.748 --> 40:19.717
I don't need this shit
from buncha hicks

40:19.850 --> 40:23.651
- You sure talk the talk
- She fucking does

40:23.754 --> 40:26.349
I can do more than talk,
assholes

40:26.557 --> 40:27.525
Mi-yun!

40:29.093 --> 40:30.652
Ma'am, call the police!

40:32.430 --> 40:35.366
Grandma, they embarrass me,
I'll wait outside

40:37.001 --> 40:40.165
Ruining a family outing,
those fuckers

40:46.710 --> 40:49.646
That's no way to
treat my precious sister

41:59.049 --> 42:00.950
How can you laugh right now?

42:01.886 --> 42:06.857
When something happens,
family's gotta help each other

42:06.857 --> 42:09.349
I applaud your solidarity

42:10.961 --> 42:13.664
I agree, mother,
I was proud of them

42:13.664 --> 42:14.597
See?

42:16.767 --> 42:19.236
Did we pay for dinner?

42:21.071 --> 42:22.539
We never did

42:28.112 --> 42:29.478
- Grandma
- Yeah?

42:29.580 --> 42:32.914
Could we stop eating pork?
I'm so sick of it

42:34.184 --> 42:35.447
Look, look at that

42:36.320 --> 42:37.821
<i>SERIAL KILLING OF
MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRLS</i>

42:37.821 --> 42:41.553
Min-kyung, be careful,
it's dangerous out there

42:41.759 --> 42:43.819
You really have to be careful

42:43.994 --> 42:47.624
You're a target 'cos you're dumb
and got a nice body

42:47.698 --> 42:49.564
How'd the killer know that?

42:49.667 --> 42:53.536
Your terrible grammar
gives it away

42:55.673 --> 42:59.940
A little common sense will go
a long way for you

43:00.044 --> 43:02.775
Why bring that up again!

43:02.980 --> 43:06.542
It's serious,
that could be you

43:06.784 --> 43:10.482
In-mo, I'll pay you
to tutor her

43:10.955 --> 43:11.718
What?

43:13.524 --> 43:17.394
It's not like you'll use
your head for anything

43:17.394 --> 43:18.596
No way!

43:18.596 --> 43:22.299
Some people are just hopeless

43:22.299 --> 43:25.667
It's impossible to force
education on them

43:26.003 --> 43:29.235
Why do you think
the killer's doing that?

43:29.707 --> 43:31.403
How'd I know that?

43:32.009 --> 43:34.808
You're a movie director,
shouldn't you know that?

43:37.581 --> 43:39.573
You're a movie director?

43:39.750 --> 43:42.117
- Which one?
- Stop right there

43:42.786 --> 43:46.023
Wait, I don't remember the title

43:46.023 --> 43:50.518
Me too, I remember him
making a fuss but not the title

43:50.728 --> 43:52.094
What was it?

43:52.262 --> 43:55.426
At the time, I thought
you'd make it big

43:55.499 --> 43:57.297
- Right?
- Enough!

44:01.772 --> 44:04.640
Wasn't it 'road' something?

44:05.009 --> 44:06.978
I'm blanking

44:07.111 --> 44:08.670
'Woman on the Road'

44:08.946 --> 44:11.472
Right, 'Woman on the Road'

44:18.756 --> 44:19.780
What?

44:20.524 --> 44:22.152
Why did you bring up the movie?

44:24.495 --> 44:26.259
What a petty asshole

44:26.797 --> 44:28.459
What? 'Petty'?

44:30.034 --> 44:36.497
There are things that
we don't want to remember

44:36.774 --> 44:37.969
You got some too

44:39.009 --> 44:40.602
Idiot

44:41.645 --> 44:45.241
Sometimes you succeed,
and sometimes you don't

44:45.315 --> 44:48.649
Don't over-analyze it

44:48.719 --> 44:51.985
Don't ever bring that up again

44:54.158 --> 44:55.717
That's it!

44:56.293 --> 44:58.091
What if I do?

44:59.096 --> 45:04.626
Think you can do whatever,
'cos I went easy on you?

45:04.768 --> 45:06.862
Don't ever forget who I am

45:21.652 --> 45:24.019
Our alliance is over, shitbag

45:36.567 --> 45:38.001
Very nice

45:39.169 --> 45:40.137
So embarrassing!

45:40.137 --> 45:41.503
Very moody

45:42.606 --> 45:45.542
I just started learning to play

45:46.043 --> 45:51.277
'My guitar plays the love story
of my bygone days'

45:53.450 --> 45:55.385
Would you play for me?

45:55.619 --> 45:57.110
Well, it's been too long

45:57.287 --> 45:59.119
Please play it for me

46:23.113 --> 46:24.274
Something wrong?

46:24.715 --> 46:28.083
I wanna see the ocean
all of sudden

46:29.019 --> 46:33.548
Drink a beer, play the guitar
and chat on the beach

46:35.025 --> 46:39.986
Su-ja, would you go to
the beach with me?

46:54.645 --> 46:57.171
What have I done,
I'm flat broke

47:08.492 --> 47:10.586
My dear Min-kyung

47:11.128 --> 47:14.155
It was because of
that fucking bitch

47:17.801 --> 47:21.260
You won't get
any smarter by smoking

47:23.340 --> 47:27.107
So you won't get allowance
if your mom finds out

47:27.177 --> 47:29.213
I'll really quit

47:29.213 --> 47:31.582
I won't get
a single cent out of her

47:31.582 --> 47:35.075
But I can't lie to your mom

47:36.153 --> 47:38.520
That's how we were raised

47:38.589 --> 47:40.820
What should I do then?

48:07.584 --> 48:10.850
What's your weekly allowance?

48:11.355 --> 48:12.414
$100

48:12.689 --> 48:16.217
Seriously?
For one middle schooler?

48:16.393 --> 48:18.555
I got my needs too

48:18.962 --> 48:22.296
That's $400 a month,
let's think about this

48:23.500 --> 48:28.768
If I keep my mouth shut,
you'll continue to get paid

48:28.906 --> 48:31.068
In other words,

48:31.842 --> 48:35.540
I'm the one granting you
your allowance, right?

48:36.680 --> 48:39.809
Think about it,
it's a simple math question

48:47.724 --> 48:50.794
Wait, is this extortion?

48:50.794 --> 48:52.422
Yeah, this is extortion

48:53.430 --> 48:55.262
Holy shit...

48:57.167 --> 48:59.136
What the hell?!

49:02.739 --> 49:03.900
Where the hell is In-mo?!

49:04.041 --> 49:04.574
<i>Mi-yun!
Your car... I'm sorry</i>

49:04.574 --> 49:05.735
<i>Mi-yun!
Your car... I'm sorry</i>
Oh In-mo!

49:10.447 --> 49:13.007
It feels so nice
to drive out of the city

49:13.083 --> 49:15.075
I feel so good too

49:27.431 --> 49:28.592
Su-ja!

49:42.612 --> 49:44.808

49:45.048 --> 49:46.846
It's okay, please

49:47.050 --> 49:50.020
Don't leave me hanging

49:56.059 --> 49:57.027
Good?

50:01.598 --> 50:03.294
Aren't you gonna drive?

50:03.467 --> 50:05.231
You shouldn't drink

50:05.535 --> 50:10.530
Don't you worry, all I need is
a short nap in the car

50:16.980 --> 50:19.074
What are you doing?

50:19.282 --> 50:20.215
Please don't

50:22.386 --> 50:23.752
Don't do this!

50:25.088 --> 50:27.489
Get away from me!

50:28.225 --> 50:30.353
Su-ja, hold still

50:41.705 --> 50:42.968
I'm so sorry

51:11.001 --> 51:14.438
I know you don't love me

51:15.772 --> 51:18.071
Love doesn't exist at our age

51:19.876 --> 51:22.573
Physical reaction is
all there is now

51:25.649 --> 51:31.054
Love is for when you're young,

51:31.054 --> 51:35.014
when you're still
full of hopes and dreams

52:35.852 --> 52:37.548
You're the cheater

52:37.854 --> 52:40.590
So I'll pay the price,
with this divorce

52:40.590 --> 52:41.751
Fine,

52:42.559 --> 52:47.361
then end things with
that trainer fucker

52:47.564 --> 52:49.692
I'm already done with him

52:50.567 --> 52:53.803
That brother of yours
made him a cripple,

52:53.803 --> 52:55.906
he left town 3 years ago

52:55.906 --> 52:58.535
Is your gangster brother
out now?

53:00.443 --> 53:05.643
Why isn't there a single
decent person in your family?

53:06.683 --> 53:07.776
What?

53:07.951 --> 53:10.546
You fucking bitch

Holy fucking shit!

55:09.606 --> 55:12.508
Call yourself a human being?!

Come back here!

Asshole, can't I jerk off
in this house?

55:18.882 --> 55:20.650

about Min-kyung?

55:20.650 --> 55:21.276
What?!

55:21.518 --> 55:25.819
She's our niece,

- Snap out of it!

- I really didn't!
- You didn't what?!

55:33.997 --> 55:35.488
What's going on here?

55:35.565 --> 55:36.066
Mom!

55:36.066 --> 55:38.399
Goddammit!

55:38.568 --> 55:40.594
Stop it!

55:40.670 --> 55:42.072
This fuck deserves to die!

Fuck, this is beyond
fucking sick

55:53.983 --> 55:57.351
You fucking animal

55:57.587 --> 56:00.590
You call yourself her uncle?!

56:00.590 --> 56:04.694
How could you?
Do you know how old she is?!

56:04.694 --> 56:06.560
You're absolutely insane!

56:06.730 --> 56:09.598
I didn't think about her!

56:09.666 --> 56:11.201
I didn't even know it was hers!

56:11.201 --> 56:14.035
Then who did you
fantasize about? Fess up!

56:14.170 --> 56:17.040
Ms. Han!
That hairdresser!

56:17.040 --> 56:18.274
In-mo, you know her!

56:18.274 --> 56:19.609
I don't care who it is

56:19.609 --> 56:22.602
Come out, you fuck!

56:23.380 --> 56:24.848
Just stop it!

56:27.217 --> 56:29.812
I know everyone's underwear

56:29.986 --> 56:32.046
This isn't Min-kyung's

56:33.390 --> 56:34.414
What?

56:34.657 --> 56:35.886
This is...

56:38.128 --> 56:39.255
mine

56:42.499 --> 56:45.264
Min-kyung, it's really not yours?

56:45.668 --> 56:48.297
No, I don't wear
baby panties like those

56:58.415 --> 57:01.476
For a worthless piece of shit,

57:01.918 --> 57:06.556
I guess he got urges like
other people, that idiot

57:06.556 --> 57:07.888
That's enough

57:08.057 --> 57:12.722
It wasn't Min-kyung's,
so just let it go

57:12.862 --> 57:16.094
How could I?
I can't just turn a blind eye

57:16.199 --> 57:19.226
How could I ever let her alone
with him in the house?

57:19.469 --> 57:21.904
There's no safe zone,
not even here

57:22.305 --> 57:23.068

57:23.740 --> 57:24.400
Yeah?

What was that?

What happened?

Have you really gone mad?

58:14.290 --> 58:17.192
Hold still! Just stay still!

58:17.327 --> 58:21.464
You shoulda just
hung yourself at the reservoir

58:21.464 --> 58:24.267
Why are you putting on
a show here?!

58:24.267 --> 58:25.530
Cold-hearted shrew!

58:25.635 --> 58:28.366
How could you say that
to your family!

58:30.173 --> 58:32.039
You're not gonna die like this!

58:34.210 --> 58:35.678
Family, my ass

58:35.745 --> 58:37.447
Get the hell out, asshole!

58:37.447 --> 58:39.712
Stop crying!

58:40.817 --> 58:41.477
Mom!

58:48.925 --> 58:51.451
Stop it!

59:05.775 --> 59:07.073
Shut the fuck up!

59:08.378 --> 59:09.437
Follow me!

59:18.688 --> 59:22.352
I really thought of Su-ja,
not Min-kyung

59:23.793 --> 59:25.523
Fine, I've heard enough

59:28.431 --> 59:33.131
I used a pretty pair because
I wanted to get it up,

59:34.404 --> 59:37.272
rub one out
and forget about Su-ja

59:38.875 --> 59:40.343
Why forget her?

59:43.680 --> 59:46.741
I saw you two
coming back from a trip

59:55.692 --> 59:57.524
Shut up and drink

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:15.044
<i>Mom, I was gonna stick it thru,
butl can do it anymore</i>

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:20.416
<i>I don like granma, uncles
and Gun-bae too</i>

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:24.020
<i>Don worrie about me
and live good life</i>

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:24.919
Mom!

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:29.858
You're a director,
can you tell anything from it?

01:00:30.059 --> 01:00:31.861
Her grammar's terrible

01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:32.962
What?

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:34.864
At this level,

01:00:34.864 --> 01:00:39.602
she wouldn't be able to
follow her classes

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:41.170
That's not important!

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:43.196
It is, it really is

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:45.975
She's at school all week,

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:48.144
and she doesn't understand
anything there

01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:50.375
Wouldn't that bother her?

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.175
So can you tell
where she is or not?!

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:55.945
Forget it!

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:58.454
I've had it!

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:01.682
I'm not coming back
until I find her

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:07.460
Go kill yourself!

01:01:08.297 --> 01:01:10.299
You're dead
if I can't find her!

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:13.002
What can you do
in the middle of the night?

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:14.061
I dunno!

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:16.796
I knew this would happen

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:32.188
Min-kyung's a smart girl,
she'll be safe

01:01:32.922 --> 01:01:36.086
Shut the hell up!
It's all your fault!

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:42.089
How could you?

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:45.098
After what my family did for you

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:46.893
Ungrateful bastard...

01:01:46.969 --> 01:01:50.106
Make an excuse for yourself!

01:01:50.106 --> 01:01:51.972
That's enough!

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:56.479
Mom, there's limit to
one's kindness

01:01:56.646 --> 01:02:00.016
This is the result of raising a child
who's not your own

01:02:00.016 --> 01:02:02.110
when you couldn't afford to

01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:03.386
Shut your mouth

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:05.254
What! It's the truth!

01:02:05.254 --> 01:02:06.449
Wait, wait

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:09.753
What did you just say?

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:13.730
That bastard,
we're not blood related

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.221
Didn't know, right?

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:19.301
Mr. Oh Han-mo, stop meddling with
this family's affairs

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:21.428
and leave us alone

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:25.374
You've been trespassing
in our lives!

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:26.933
Stop it!

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:32.148
You're being too harsh

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:33.810
Even if he's not mom's child,

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:38.216
we're still from the same dad,
so our DNA's not that different

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:40.516
We got similar blood in us

01:02:42.024 --> 01:02:46.928
Similar my ass,
not the same dad either

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:51.300
Dad took him in with
his ex-wife before mom

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.201
We're not related at all!

01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:01.342
Dad worked so hard to raise him

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:08.047
The least you can do is
not cause any harm

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:17.053
You have no right
to call him dad either

01:03:19.028 --> 01:03:21.998
No one knows except mom

01:03:23.032 --> 01:03:24.125
Mom

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:27.336
Why did you do it?

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.066
You betrayed him

01:03:30.606 --> 01:03:36.773
He died raising a daughter
that wasn't his

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:39.041
What are you talking about?

01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:45.452
Your real father is still alive,
go find him

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:52.623
Mom, what's he talking about?

01:03:53.229 --> 01:03:56.063
Dad isn't my real dad?

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:59.428
So we're not related either?

01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:05.909
Shit!

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:09.909
Not you too honey,
this beef's going to waste!

01:04:11.447 --> 01:04:12.582
Waste?

01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:14.346
What's so big deal about it?

01:04:16.219 --> 01:04:20.782
Did you moonlight
so you can buy the beef?

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:23.818
Think you can fool me?

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:27.986
With full make-up on,
you went to old men in town

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:30.794
and sold your body for it

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:33.769
And you want us to
eat that dirty meat?!

01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:36.172
Will you please stop?

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:37.640
I saw it all

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:42.106
Going into an old man's room
for more than 2 hours

01:04:42.378 --> 01:04:45.405
And he bought beef for you,
I saw it all!

01:04:49.752 --> 01:04:52.889
You should've asked me
if you needed money

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:56.189
I love veggies,
you didn't have to!

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:38.633
<i>Titanic Melons</i>

01:05:42.738 --> 01:05:44.407
Great, I'm glad

01:05:44.407 --> 01:05:47.910
This one's on a whole new level

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:51.681
The title alone
screams 'blockbuster'!

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:54.083
Titanic Melons, you feel it?

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:56.746
This title is very refreshing

01:05:56.886 --> 01:06:00.653
Very refreshing indeed,
huge, gigantic tits

01:06:00.756 --> 01:06:01.621
I see

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:04.284
You've changed completely
so quickly

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:05.761
Are you the same guy?

01:06:05.761 --> 01:06:08.925
I am indeed,
the best sex scene director

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:15.403
Sir, I do have one condition

01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:16.834
What is it?

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:18.965
I need an advance $1,000

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:28.948
Better keep your promise

01:06:29.118 --> 01:06:32.088
We'll find you no problem,

01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:36.615
just like we will find your niece

01:06:40.629 --> 01:06:43.224
Really! I don't know
where Min-kyung is

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:45.234
Wait, wait!

01:06:45.234 --> 01:06:46.327
One sec

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:50.565
Do you wanna smoke?

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:52.706
What the hell?

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:54.575
Never mind

01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:02.911
Buy yourself something nice

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:04.681
So annoying

01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:09.187
All I know is, she said
she's going to Cheonan

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:10.883
Cheonan? Where exactly?

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:14.221
That's all I know

01:07:16.532 --> 01:07:17.830
Cheonan...

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:45.593
It's very pretty, isn't it?

01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:47.361
Just like me

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:53.970
It's cold, let's go in

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:57.272
Han-mo's...

01:07:59.308 --> 01:08:02.369
mom died of a disease,

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:07.443
and he was only 2 years old

01:08:08.784 --> 01:08:10.753
when I married your father

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:25.959
At the time, I was seen
as an immoral woman

01:08:27.435 --> 01:08:30.564
Sure, I admit it

01:08:33.975 --> 01:08:40.609
Maybe it's an excuse,
but as a woman,

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:45.787
I needed love too

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:57.462
When I look at you,
I understand your dad

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:04.764
And when I look at myself,
I understand Mi-yun too

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:10.546
But In-mo, we're all family

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:16.984
Han-mo, Mi-yun,
and you too

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:21.090
There's nothing to it

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:25.761
Live, eat, and sleep,
cry and laugh together,

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:28.595
that's what a family is

01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:04.532
In-mo

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:06.929

that's why I risked my life

01:17:06.254 --> 01:17:07.449
Satisfied?

01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:10.220
Laters

01:17:17.165 --> 01:17:18.895
Fucking moron

01:17:23.505 --> 01:17:24.666
Last one

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:30.035
It's all done, bud

01:17:31.046 --> 01:17:32.708
I mean, boss

01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:41.315
Yo, pill pusher

01:17:43.592 --> 01:17:45.686
When do I go to jail?

01:17:48.964 --> 01:17:53.629
It's a pop-up shop,
but it'll run for 4-5 months

01:17:54.469 --> 01:18:01.637
I paid a large sum to settle
your niece incident

01:18:01.743 --> 01:18:02.938
Know that, right?

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:06.547
I know

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:16.891
My life's really turning around,

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:22.061
after getting this lighter

01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:28.570
It's my lucky charm

01:18:36.278 --> 01:18:37.405
We're here

01:19:02.471 --> 01:19:07.102
Mr. Oh, I'm getting tired of
winning so much,

01:19:07.175 --> 01:19:08.643
but losing's just as fun

01:19:08.944 --> 01:19:12.278
How much to run this?
I'll buy you out

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:13.848
Did you lose a lot?

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:19.181
I'm serious,
I'm a walking ATM

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:22.084
Don't believe me, huh?

01:19:46.314 --> 01:19:51.582
One grows stronger
after suffering hardship

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:55.985
Geun-bae, take care of
my Mi-yun

01:19:57.425 --> 01:19:58.984
Yes, mother

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.097
Who are you?

01:20:15.577 --> 01:20:19.514
Mister, what do you think
you're doing here?

01:20:19.514 --> 01:20:21.142
Please leave

01:20:22.117 --> 01:20:24.211
You can't be here!

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:26.182
Why are you late?

01:20:26.354 --> 01:20:30.382
It wasn't easy
working up the courage

01:20:31.059 --> 01:20:32.618
Mom, what are you doing?

01:20:44.272 --> 01:20:45.774
Who...

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:49.802
Say hello,
this is your father

01:20:55.917 --> 01:21:02.448
I don't deserve to look at you,
I'm sorry

01:21:21.509 --> 01:21:24.069
We'll talk in detail later

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:29.708
I asked him to
walk you down the aisle

01:22:36.051 --> 01:22:38.350
Why do you wanna come here?

01:22:41.056 --> 01:22:47.758
I want to thank your dad
for finding a great guy for Mi-yun

01:22:57.372 --> 01:23:02.401
When was the happiest moment
of your life?

01:23:03.712 --> 01:23:04.702
Happiest?

01:23:06.848 --> 01:23:07.941
Well...

01:23:10.919 --> 01:23:12.512
My movie's release day?

01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:15.180
I think it was that

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:21.391
Yeah? I think we all have
our glory days

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:25.256
Perhaps those were yours

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:30.532
- And you?
- Me?

01:23:31.639 --> 01:23:33.904
Mine is... well...

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:38.542
What, you've never been happy?

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:43.248
No, too many to say,
can't pick just one

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:45.778
Lame answer

01:24:00.402 --> 01:24:03.998
<i>Yo idiot, why aren't you
answering your phone?</i>

01:24:06.174 --> 01:24:08.370
<i>Mi-yun's wedding's tomorrow</i>

01:24:09.277 --> 01:24:13.271
<i>Mom's worried sick for a son
she did not give birth to</i>

01:24:13.481 --> 01:24:16.383
<i>Show up tomorrow for her</i>

01:24:31.666 --> 01:24:33.362
Mr. Oh, Mr. Oh

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:36.265
We need to talk

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:40.074
Do me this favor

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:43.602
Hand this place over to me

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:48.783
Dammit,
you're putting me in a spot

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:53.517
Sir, over 30 grand
passes through here daily

01:24:53.688 --> 01:24:56.817
I know, 900 a month

01:24:57.125 --> 01:24:59.253
I'll pay top dollar for it

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:02.926
You're talking out of your ass

01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:08.463
I'm good to go anytime,
this is for real

01:25:40.835 --> 01:25:43.862
He strides around like
he's really the boss

01:25:44.506 --> 01:25:47.442
That fuck still calls me
'pill pusher'

01:25:48.176 --> 01:25:53.080
When this is over,
I'll frame him for extra charges

01:25:53.715 --> 01:25:56.981
Oh Han-mo?
He's a corpse in the coffin

01:25:57.819 --> 01:25:59.879
- That everything?
- Yes, boss

01:26:09.998 --> 01:26:13.560
A corpse in the coffin?

01:26:22.143 --> 01:26:23.406
Alright

01:26:33.054 --> 01:26:37.492
Ki-su, I got a job for you

01:26:48.469 --> 01:26:52.770
- Hello?
<i>- Mom, it's me</i>

01:26:53.942 --> 01:26:57.912
Son, where are you?

01:26:57.912 --> 01:26:59.710
Are you eating well?

01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:06.352
Of course, I got a job too,
I'm a boss now

01:27:06.521 --> 01:27:07.716
Nice, eh?

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:10.458
<i>That's really great!</i>

01:27:10.458 --> 01:27:16.557
<i>I'm really glad, butl'll be
happier with you home</i>

01:27:17.198 --> 01:27:19.997
<i>So many things
to discuss with you</i>

01:27:21.803 --> 01:27:23.738
Han-mo, can you hear me?

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:29.436
Yeah I can hear you,
but the signal's not great

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:34.811
<i>Mi-yun's wedding is tomorrow,
you'll be there, right?</i>

01:27:35.216 --> 01:27:37.082
<i>Please come, honey</i>

01:27:39.887 --> 01:27:42.015
Of course, I'll be there

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:49.121
But mom, I got a business trip
so I can't stay long

01:27:50.231 --> 01:27:51.927
<i>Yeah, I know, I know</i>

01:27:52.066 --> 01:27:54.160
But please come

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:58.100
I can't see her off
without you

01:28:00.408 --> 01:28:02.543
<i>Han-mo, can you hear me?</i>

01:28:02.543 --> 01:28:04.245
Hello? Hello?

01:28:04.245 --> 01:28:05.213
<i>Hello?</i>

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:08.081
Stupid phone

01:28:33.541 --> 01:28:34.873
Did you get it or not?

01:28:35.877 --> 01:28:38.779
Can't you see me sitting here?

01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:40.772
What do you think?

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:43.611
Just answer me, asshole!

01:28:56.197 --> 01:28:57.028
Let's go

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:11.274
- Thank you for coming
- Congrats!

01:29:13.614 --> 01:29:14.946
So good to see you!

01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:19.620
Honestly, this one's
so much better

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:21.089
Yeah, looks very earnest too

01:29:21.089 --> 01:29:24.423
Why're you so lucky
with men?!

01:29:30.398 --> 01:29:32.264
Good luck!

01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:35.028
Hello

01:29:39.874 --> 01:29:41.676
A good turn out?

01:29:41.676 --> 01:29:43.736
Yeah, it's packed

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:53.315
- Oh Mi-yun
- What?

01:29:54.622 --> 01:29:55.954
So pretty

01:30:02.764 --> 01:30:03.823
In-mo

01:30:04.899 --> 01:30:05.889
What?

01:30:08.536 --> 01:30:12.439
I'm sorry I've treated you
so badly

01:30:13.841 --> 01:30:15.605
Sorry for what?

01:30:15.877 --> 01:30:19.245
We were always like this,
constantly fighting

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:21.307
We sure were

01:30:22.316 --> 01:30:24.182
We fought non-stop

01:30:26.154 --> 01:30:30.023
If one of us came home bruised,
we'd go beat 'em up

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:37.699
Why are you crying,
it's not your first wedding

01:30:38.132 --> 01:30:41.261
- You'll mess up your face
- I know

01:30:41.636 --> 01:30:44.367
Why is it so sad,
I've done this many times

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:49.343
I wanted to congratulate you

01:30:50.478 --> 01:30:53.209
It's about to start,
stop crying

01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:55.707
- Break a leg
- Yeah

01:30:59.587 --> 01:31:00.577
In-mo

01:31:03.558 --> 01:31:04.651
Where's Han-mo?

01:31:08.429 --> 01:31:10.660
He'll be here, probably

01:31:14.202 --> 01:31:16.068
- Afternoon, boss!
- Hey

01:31:16.504 --> 01:31:18.200
Clean the office

01:31:18.439 --> 01:31:19.307
Yes, sir

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:21.299
- Get to it
- Yes, boss!

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:19.867
Where did you get this?

01:32:19.867 --> 01:32:22.166
I took it as a souvenir,
isn't it cute?

01:32:24.906 --> 01:32:26.306
You crazy bastard!

01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:31.512
What's the matter?

01:33:05.279 --> 01:33:10.217
Groom Jung Geun-bae
and bride Oh Mi-yun...

01:33:10.217 --> 01:33:12.153
Sorry for tearing up

01:33:12.153 --> 01:33:19.060
...friends, colleagues and family,
you're all gathered here...

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:35.805
Took off, eh?

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:47.821
If mom asks, tell her I'm away
on overseas business

01:33:48.522 --> 01:33:51.549
As long as 3 presidential terms

01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:56.029
And take this

01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:01.125
What is it?

01:34:02.169 --> 01:34:03.262
For groceries

01:34:05.072 --> 01:34:07.906
It's about time I pay back
for years of hospitality

01:34:10.144 --> 01:34:11.544
Take good care of her

01:34:14.048 --> 01:34:15.414
I'm off

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:20.386
Uncle!

01:34:25.026 --> 01:34:27.962
Can't you say
where you're going?

01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:29.892
Is it picture time?

01:34:39.106 --> 01:34:40.508
Let's go

01:34:40.508 --> 01:34:41.635
At least take a photo

01:34:42.977 --> 01:34:44.138
Come on already!

01:34:47.415 --> 01:34:51.978
Thank you everyone,
bride's family up next!

01:34:57.024 --> 01:34:58.652
Is this all of you?

01:35:01.228 --> 01:35:02.594
Family of the bride!

01:35:03.931 --> 01:35:05.422
Wait, we're here!

01:35:07.702 --> 01:35:09.398
Get in there!

01:35:17.044 --> 01:35:20.414
In the back, the tie-less gent,
come down a step

01:35:20.414 --> 01:35:22.049
Very good

01:35:22.049 --> 01:35:24.018
A little to your right

01:35:24.018 --> 01:35:27.321
To your right, not your left

01:35:27.321 --> 01:35:31.192
A little bit to your right

01:35:31.192 --> 01:35:32.460
Very good

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:37.698
Aren't you all family?
Why isn't anyone smiling!

01:35:37.698 --> 01:35:39.967
Smile everyone, smile!

01:35:39.967 --> 01:35:41.492
Stand up straight,
one, two, three!

01:35:51.979 --> 01:35:55.245
In-mo,
I'm really going

01:36:07.361 --> 01:36:13.028
Director Oh, I'm proud to
have you as my brother

01:36:14.068 --> 01:36:16.094
Go away, I'm sick of you

01:36:39.026 --> 01:36:40.426
Hey, Mr. Director!

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:50.565
<i>Bud, I told you you can't
get away from me</i>

01:36:50.905 --> 01:36:54.103
<i>Isn't Oh In-mo your brother?</i>

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:55.367
<i>I'm hanging up</i>

01:37:01.282 --> 01:37:03.979
Bitch, time for a stroll

01:37:04.051 --> 01:37:09.354
Come 'ere buddy!

01:37:11.992 --> 01:37:14.587
Enough, bring him over

01:37:27.474 --> 01:37:28.464
Raise him

01:37:35.816 --> 01:37:38.718
You said you got
something to say earlier

01:37:40.287 --> 01:37:42.518
Alright, let's hear it

01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:50.097
I was gonna tell you everything,

01:37:51.498 --> 01:37:55.060
but I changed my mind

01:37:56.503 --> 01:37:59.632
Because you damaged my pride

01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:06.103
I'm sure you ignorant fucks
don't know,

01:38:08.182 --> 01:38:11.016
but this is no way
to treat a person

01:38:13.821 --> 01:38:16.484
We created an incredible civilization,

01:38:18.459 --> 01:38:24.091
and kept a shred of dignity while
fostering the systems we live in

01:38:26.433 --> 01:38:29.494
No matter how you live your life,

01:38:30.304 --> 01:38:33.536
you mustn't lose track of that,
you fucking lowlife!

01:38:33.807 --> 01:38:34.866
Let him be

01:38:38.312 --> 01:38:43.216
Han-mo bragged 'bout his
director bro, you're a sharp one

01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:44.943
I'm not done, dipshit

01:38:46.353 --> 01:38:48.845
You treated me like an animal

01:38:51.191 --> 01:38:54.161
You didn't just beat an individual,

01:38:55.763 --> 01:39:01.134
but crushed the legacy we've
achieved over centuries

01:39:04.138 --> 01:39:06.801
Crushed human dignity!

01:39:08.275 --> 01:39:15.307
Dignity or not, so you're saying
you'll die for Oh Han-mo

01:39:15.783 --> 01:39:17.581
Think carefully now

01:39:17.851 --> 01:39:21.049
Even if you're brothers,
why die for a human trash?

01:39:24.325 --> 01:39:28.228
Sure, I'll die for him

01:39:31.198 --> 01:39:34.066
Something dawned on me
during the beat

01:39:37.805 --> 01:39:39.171
I...

01:39:40.541 --> 01:39:43.602
treated him like shit

01:39:46.947 --> 01:39:50.213
He even went to
prison for me

01:39:52.586 --> 01:39:57.183
I've done nothing
for him in return

01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:13.873
Paying back like this
ain't so bad
