00:00.367 --> 00:02.133
You had a physical fight.

00:02.200 --> 00:03.100
I called the police.

00:04.300 --> 00:05.934
'Cause my head was leaking blood.

00:07.033 --> 00:09.266
You had hit him
over the head with a speaker!

00:09.333 --> 00:10.266
In self-defense.

00:10.333 --> 00:11.600
We were arguing.

00:11.667 --> 00:12.934
Had you both been drinking?

00:15.233 --> 00:18.633
The two of you were clearly
blotto drunk.

Court come to order. All rise.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.233
Be seated please.

00:49.533 --> 00:53.333
Hello, Judge. We have case number 1023,
Parra vs. Jordan.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.633
-Thank you.
-Mm-hm.

00:55.300 --> 00:59.800
Miss Parra, Mr. Jordan is your former
boyfriend, and you claim,

00:59.867 --> 01:03.100
over the course of the relationship,
a series of loans.

01:03.166 --> 01:05.800
Mr. Jordan has a cross complaint.

01:05.867 --> 01:09.467
And his cross complaint is
for a serious assault

01:09.533 --> 01:12.800
that he claims he was
the victim of at your hand.

01:12.867 --> 01:15.767
According to what I've read,
you met the defendant

01:15.834 --> 01:18.633
in 2019 online. Is that right?

01:18.700 --> 01:20.967
-That's not correct.
-[Judy] What year?

01:21.033 --> 01:24.433
We met in January of 2019
in a restaurant

01:24.500 --> 01:28.000
when he was working for
a micro-wrestling team.

01:28.066 --> 01:30.500
Okay, were you
a customer at that restaurant?

01:30.567 --> 01:32.133
-I was an employee.
-[Judy] And he?

01:32.200 --> 01:35.266
[Christina]
He was an assigned vendor, I guess?

01:35.333 --> 01:37.967
That they came in and set up
and did micro-wrestling.

01:38.033 --> 01:41.734
In what month did you
begin living together?

01:41.800 --> 01:43.934
-April.
-[Judy] And he came to live with you?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.633
-You have three children.
-That is correct.

01:45.700 --> 01:49.300
According to your complaint,
the first loan that you made to him

01:49.367 --> 01:51.734
-was for dental work.
-That is correct.

01:51.800 --> 01:56.567
The second loan that you made to him
was for travel expenses

01:56.633 --> 02:00.467
to go to another jurisdiction
so he could reconnect

02:00.533 --> 02:03.433
with a child that he had
from another relationship.

02:03.500 --> 02:04.500
That is correct.

02:04.567 --> 02:07.533
And you had never met that child
or the child's mother.

02:08.233 --> 02:09.133
That is correct.

02:09.200 --> 02:10.734
And you were curious.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.467
No, I was just trying to help.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.433
Well, let's get to the first loan.

02:14.500 --> 02:19.500
Because living as long as I have,
it give you certain advantages.

02:19.567 --> 02:24.000
Those advantages are that there
are certain things that...

02:24.066 --> 02:28.567
regularly happen
when a woman is crazy about a guy

02:28.633 --> 02:32.100
and wants to do everything
to make it solid.

02:32.166 --> 02:34.033
The first loan that you made to him

02:34.100 --> 02:36.667
was in what year to have his teeth fixed?

02:36.734 --> 02:38.233
December of 2019.

02:38.300 --> 02:42.500
I want you to tell me your version
of this loan for dental work.

02:42.567 --> 02:44.967
Okay, so we had started dating.

02:45.033 --> 02:47.734
He had told me that he had
went to prison in the past

02:47.800 --> 02:50.166
and that's why his teeth
were all rotted out.

02:50.233 --> 02:53.233
-And that was a lie, most of his teeth.
-Look at me. Just a second.

02:53.300 --> 02:54.533
Just a second.

02:54.600 --> 02:58.633
You have to understand that I understand

02:58.700 --> 03:00.967
casual conversation, pillow talk.

03:01.033 --> 03:03.567
I know the difference
between those things.

03:03.633 --> 03:08.667
So I want you to tell me exactly
when he asked you for a loan

03:08.734 --> 03:09.934
to have his teeth fixed.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.900
I don't know the exact date
of when he asked me.

03:12.967 --> 03:15.266
I mean, it had just been conversations
that had been coming up.

03:15.333 --> 03:18.200
Um, every time I'd make dinner,
it would be really hard for him to chew,

03:18.266 --> 03:19.500
he only had one tooth.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.233
So, I mean, I'd have to coordinate
my dinners on what he could eat.

03:24.300 --> 03:27.433
So it would come up frequently
in a lot of conversations.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.900
"What are we gonna do about your teeth?"

03:28.967 --> 03:30.000
And he was like,
"Well, I need to get my teeth done."

03:30.066 --> 03:31.433
No, just a second-- Ah!

03:31.500 --> 03:34.667
"What are we going to do
about your teeth?"

03:34.734 --> 03:35.800
Keep going.

03:35.867 --> 03:39.266
Right, and I said,
"Well, we can research some things.

03:39.333 --> 03:42.000
But you're gonna have to
pay for this on your own.

03:42.066 --> 03:45.266
That didn't happen.
That last phrase didn't happen.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.800
"We'll research it and see."
That happened.

03:47.867 --> 03:49.900
-Mm-hmm.
-[Judy] And who researched it?

03:49.967 --> 03:51.066
He did.

03:51.133 --> 03:55.300
Did you research where to go
to have your teeth fixed?

03:55.367 --> 03:58.300
-No, actually, she re-- No, I didn't.
-[Judy] Just-- Just--

03:58.367 --> 04:01.400
[Judy] Who found the place
to have your teeth fixed?

04:01.467 --> 04:02.767
Uh, the plaintiff did.

04:02.834 --> 04:03.967
[Judy] Who made the appointment?

04:04.033 --> 04:05.200
[Lorenzo] The plaintiff did.

04:05.266 --> 04:08.433
[Judy] Did she discuss with you?
I mean, she had to take you with her

04:08.500 --> 04:10.934
so I want you to tell me
what the discussion was.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.400
She said, "I'll make the appointment."
And she made the appointment?

04:13.467 --> 04:15.934
Yeah, it was more of like
a surprise to me. Um...

04:16.000 --> 04:16.900
That's not true.

04:16.967 --> 04:18.233
-[Lorenzo] Just because--
-Don't speak.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.600
-Just because, I didn't-- you know,
-[Judy] I don't care what you thought.

04:21.667 --> 04:24.734
Did she say to you, "I made an appointment
for you to have your teeth done?"

04:24.800 --> 04:27.633
-[Lorenzo] Yes.
-Okay. Where were you working at the time?

04:27.700 --> 04:30.900
-Part time at Cheesecake Factory.
-Doing what?

04:30.967 --> 04:32.033
[Lorenzo] Uh, dishwashing.

04:32.100 --> 04:34.333
[Judy] And what kind of work
does the plaintiff do?

04:34.400 --> 04:37.667
Usually restaurant work.
Uh, server.

04:37.734 --> 04:41.066
[Judy] Other than working
at a restaurant, Miss Parra,

04:41.133 --> 04:43.967
tell me what other source of income you
have. You have three children.

04:44.033 --> 04:46.033
Does their father send child support?

04:46.100 --> 04:48.834
At the time, they were,
and yes, I always had two jobs.

04:48.900 --> 04:52.333
-I had sales jobs and the restaurant.
-[Judy] Sales. Restaurant...

04:52.400 --> 04:53.500
[Christina]
The restaurant was more like a side--

04:53.567 --> 04:54.633
And you get child support.

04:54.700 --> 04:57.266
And how much child support
do you get for the children?

04:57.333 --> 05:00.266
[Christina] It was around $1,200.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.800
-[Judy] A month.
-Yes.

05:01.867 --> 05:05.600
When you were living with Mr. Jordan,
living with him--

05:05.667 --> 05:08.467
-Mm-hmm.
-[Judy] In December of 2020,

05:08.533 --> 05:09.900
what kind of work was he doing?

05:09.967 --> 05:13.000
-He was unemployed at first. And then...
-[Judy] Unemployed.

05:13.066 --> 05:16.533
Now, just-- In December,
he was unemployed.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.500
-December...
-[Judy] 2020.

05:18.567 --> 05:21.100
I'm not sure--
I can't keep track of all his jobs.

05:21.166 --> 05:22.400
-He had so many.
-[Judy] Okay.

05:22.467 --> 05:26.100
Okay. So either he was unemployed
or had a series of...

05:27.033 --> 05:28.467
He was changing jobs left and right.

05:28.533 --> 05:31.033
So he was doing the micro-wrestling,
then he went to Cheesecake,

05:31.100 --> 05:32.266
then he went to another job.

05:32.333 --> 05:35.967
But his employment history,
let us say, was sketchy.

05:36.033 --> 05:37.433
I wouldn't say "sketchy," just...

05:37.500 --> 05:40.700
Well, what, you go from job to job,
and sometimes you're employed.

05:40.767 --> 05:43.633
-[Christina] Yeah, okay.
-I would describe that as "sketchy."

05:43.700 --> 05:44.600
[Christina] Sketchy, I guess, yeah.

05:44.667 --> 05:47.567
-Yeah, trying to figure things out.
-[Judy] And you were working two jobs.

05:47.633 --> 05:50.033
-Mm-hmm.
-[Judy] To support you and your kids.

05:50.100 --> 05:53.300
And was getting $1,200 child support.

05:53.367 --> 05:57.300
When he was living with you,
was he paying any portion of the rent?

05:57.367 --> 06:00.266
-He was supposed to be.
-Not-- That's not my question.

06:00.333 --> 06:03.700
You met in January,
you moved in a few months later

06:03.767 --> 06:07.967
in December 2020,
which is almost a year later.

06:08.033 --> 06:10.500
-Mm-hmm.
-Between that period of time,

06:10.567 --> 06:11.867
did he pay you any rent?

06:11.934 --> 06:13.066
Not a set amount, no.

06:13.133 --> 06:15.600
He just gave me
a little bit towards utilities.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.500
The answer is,
"No, he paid no rent."

06:18.567 --> 06:19.533
No, he paid no rent.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.066
[Judy] Now, did he go
with you to the dentist?

06:22.133 --> 06:27.333
-Yes. And he did pick one.
-Shh!

06:28.367 --> 06:31.600
And were you told how much
the dental work would be?

06:31.667 --> 06:32.834
-[Christina] Yes.
-[Judy] How much?

06:32.900 --> 06:36.500
Around $13,000. $13,376.

06:36.567 --> 06:39.133
Well, certainly,
Mr. Jordan didn't have that.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.133
No, so we're doing-- we were going to
do some sort of financing, so...

06:42.200 --> 06:44.834
[laughs]
You were living with him for a year.

06:44.900 --> 06:46.300
You know all the rules.

06:46.367 --> 06:47.834
You know the rules,
you know he had sketchy--

06:47.900 --> 06:49.033
-I didn't know his credit score.
-What?

06:49.100 --> 06:50.467
I didn't know his credit score.

06:50.533 --> 06:53.633
[Judy] You were living with him.
You sound like an intelligent woman.

06:53.700 --> 06:56.567
You know that when you have
a sketchy work history,

06:56.633 --> 06:59.734
and are unemployed,
and you knew that that was accurate,

06:59.800 --> 07:02.133
you don't have much of a credit history.

07:02.200 --> 07:05.300
So you signed on to allow him
to get the dental work

07:05.367 --> 07:06.867
with your credit card.

07:06.934 --> 07:08.800
-That's either a yes or no.
-Yes.

07:08.867 --> 07:11.867
Now, in what month and year
did you separate?

07:11.934 --> 07:15.100
In October of 2020.

07:15.166 --> 07:18.266
[Judy]
Between December and October,

07:18.333 --> 07:20.834
when you separated,
how many payments

07:20.900 --> 07:25.500
did Mr. Jordan make on the credit card
for his dental work?

07:25.567 --> 07:27.967
-Zero.
-How many payments did you make?

07:28.033 --> 07:29.867
I have made every payment since.

07:29.934 --> 07:31.033
Right.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.266
[dramatic music]

07:34.967 --> 07:37.500
Either the children,
the older ones, testified,

07:37.567 --> 07:41.033
or the counsel for the children
reported to the court

07:41.100 --> 07:43.333
that they have interviewed the children
and the children

07:43.400 --> 07:45.800
wish to remain with their father
'cause their mother...

07:45.867 --> 07:47.200
is a nut!

07:47.266 --> 07:48.300
Yes.

07:48.367 --> 07:50.100
Do I look like I need any help from you?

07:50.166 --> 07:51.000
Sorry.

07:51.133 --> 07:52.133
[chuckling]

07:55.734 --> 07:57.567

[narrator] <i>Christina Parra claims</i>
<i>former boyfriend Lorenzo Jordan</i>

08:07.934 --> 08:12.000
<i>Lorenzo is countersuing for injuries</i>
<i>resulting from an assault.</i>

08:12.066 --> 08:14.900
Now, after you went to the dentist,

08:14.967 --> 08:19.133
after you knew he had no credit,
after you put it on your card,

08:19.200 --> 08:23.800
and after he made
no payments on that card,

08:23.867 --> 08:27.967
in what month did you
arrange for this trip

08:28.033 --> 08:32.066
to visit his ex-girlfriend and his child?

08:32.633 --> 08:34.033
A couple months, maybe, after.

08:34.100 --> 08:35.834
[Judy]
A couple of months after he got teeth.

08:38.166 --> 08:40.300
-Possibly, yeah.
-I know the story.

08:41.066 --> 08:44.400
I've been here forever.
So after he got new teeth...

08:44.467 --> 08:46.200
-Mm-hmm.
-[Judy] ...looked a lot better...

08:46.266 --> 08:47.767
-And could eat properly. Mm-hmm.
-[Judy] According to you--

08:47.834 --> 08:53.033
According to you, you felt badly
that he had not connected

08:53.100 --> 08:54.667
with his child.

08:54.734 --> 08:55.934
You felt badly.

08:56.367 --> 08:57.967
Clearly, he didn't feel badly.

08:58.033 --> 09:01.233
Now, am I reading these papers right?

09:01.300 --> 09:03.700
You reached out to the ex-girlfriend?

09:03.767 --> 09:05.233
-Yes I did.
-Okay.

09:05.300 --> 09:08.333
-Not him.
-[Christina] He asked me to, yes.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.600
-[Judy] Oh, did he?
-[Christina] Yes, he did.

09:09.667 --> 09:11.367
-He wanted to see his child.
-[Judy] No, no, no.

09:11.433 --> 09:14.033
I want you to tell me
exactly how that happened.

09:14.100 --> 09:17.533
That he asked you to
reach out to his ex-girlfriend.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.567
-Yeah.
-[Judy] I want to tell you

09:18.633 --> 09:20.467
there's a certain common sense....

09:21.166 --> 09:22.000
to life.

09:23.300 --> 09:26.867
And you're gonna have to be
really convincing to me,

09:26.934 --> 09:29.066
which I'm gonna tell you
you're not gonna be able to do,

09:29.500 --> 09:33.667
that he really wanted to see his child,
which is what you're gonna tell me.

09:33.734 --> 09:36.500
And instead of him calling his
ex-girlfriend and saying,

09:36.567 --> 09:40.400
"Listen, I know I've been
less than a parent

09:40.467 --> 09:42.467
and I've been less than interested.

09:42.533 --> 09:44.533
I'm getting older. I...

09:44.600 --> 09:46.400
sort of turned myself around.

09:46.467 --> 09:49.266
I would like to see our daughter."
Right?

09:49.333 --> 09:52.867
He asked you, his current girlfriend,
with who's he living,

09:52.934 --> 09:55.100
to call his ex-girlfriend...
[chuckles]

09:57.033 --> 10:00.767
and say,
"We would like to come out to visit."

10:00.834 --> 10:03.233
It's absolutely ridiculous

10:03.300 --> 10:06.734
that if he really wanted to see the child,
he would have his current girlfriend

10:06.800 --> 10:09.967
make the call, which would just
exasperate this woman

10:10.033 --> 10:12.000
no end that
now he's living with somebody...

10:12.533 --> 10:14.533
-Who are you?
-I'm the child's mother.

10:14.600 --> 10:15.433
Yeah.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.133
-[Judy] Who called you?
-Um, she did. For him.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.400
Good, sit. Sit!

10:24.367 --> 10:26.100
And when you called her...?

10:26.166 --> 10:28.800
He tried to reach out to her first,
and then she wouldn't...

10:28.867 --> 10:32.300
When you called her,
what did you say?

10:32.367 --> 10:34.633
I said that
"Lorenzo's been trying to reach you.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.734
And that I know that you two have--
are on bad terms.

10:37.800 --> 10:41.133
He has done some horrible things.
He hasn't paid his child support,

10:41.200 --> 10:43.333
still isn't current
on his child support.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.967
He's trying to make things better.

10:45.033 --> 10:48.734
So... you know, I'd like to
try to step in between and help...

10:49.433 --> 10:50.700
reunite a family."

10:51.033 --> 10:53.567
-I know...
-[chuckles] Okay.

10:54.133 --> 10:55.400
[Christina]
I was just trying to be helpful.

10:55.467 --> 11:01.467
So you were helpful, and that's
the second loan you are alleging

11:01.533 --> 11:06.300
for all the money that was spent
going to visit his child

11:06.367 --> 11:09.133
in Kansas, for which
he really didn't need you,

11:09.200 --> 11:11.300
'cause he could've gone alone.
Okay.

11:11.367 --> 11:14.333
Give me the story that you claim you had,

11:14.400 --> 11:17.967
a discussion with him about paying
expenses for this trip.

11:18.033 --> 11:21.867
So for this trip, he said that, you know,
as long as we use my car,

11:21.934 --> 11:23.834
he would help pay the gas,
pay the food,

11:24.367 --> 11:27.900
and the hotel,
and he would pay me back. Monthly.

11:27.967 --> 11:29.700
He would just give me money
and pay me back

11:29.767 --> 11:30.967
and that never happened.

11:31.033 --> 11:32.100
Along with the dental bill,

11:32.166 --> 11:33.834
-which I have text messages saying--
-That's a lie, Your Honor.

11:33.900 --> 11:35.700
[Christina] I have text messages saying
he would pay me back

11:35.767 --> 11:37.233
everything that he owed me.

11:37.300 --> 11:40.367
Okay, now I'd like to see
the text messages.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.333
[Christina] Absolutely.

11:56.066 --> 11:59.166
Okay, would you show this to Mr. Jordan?

12:06.033 --> 12:06.900
Okay...

12:07.533 --> 12:09.333
I never said anything
about a dental bill in this.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.300
[Judy] Yeah, yeah.

12:10.367 --> 12:12.700
There is discussion
of a dental bill in there,

12:12.767 --> 12:15.400
not about anything else, but there is
discussion of the dental bill.

12:16.467 --> 12:17.734
Not the trip to Kansas.

12:17.800 --> 12:21.734
Yeah, and the reason why, um,
I said that is because

12:21.800 --> 12:25.734
she said in this that, you know,
she still would want to be with me

12:25.800 --> 12:29.767
if I held up my end of the bargain
on paying her back,

12:29.834 --> 12:32.533
and I was so concerned about
getting back with her

12:32.600 --> 12:35.233
that I just said anything
to get back with her.

12:35.300 --> 12:36.166
[Judy] Who cares?

12:37.100 --> 12:38.567
-I do.
-[Judy] I don't.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.934
You know, it seems to me, Mr. Jordan,
first of all, you said it.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
And it's in writing.

12:42.066 --> 12:45.433
Right now, do you still have the teeth
that she's paying for?

12:45.500 --> 12:46.967
-Yes, I do.
-[Judy] Very nice.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.266
And are you living with her?

12:48.333 --> 12:49.533
-No, I'm not.
-Okay.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.066
So you have the pleasure of the teeth.

12:52.133 --> 12:55.066
And she has the pleasure
of paying the bill for your teeth.

12:55.133 --> 12:56.834
-A gift that she gave me--
-[Judy] Just--just--

12:56.900 --> 13:00.834
Not according to you.
I would've said it was a gift, actually.

13:00.900 --> 13:03.000
I actu-- would've said,

13:03.066 --> 13:07.433
"Listen, lady, you want to be
among those stupid women

13:07.500 --> 13:11.300
who loans a guy money and he doesn't
pay her back. And he doesn't--"

13:11.367 --> 13:13.300
I'm speaking. Don't interrupt me.

13:13.367 --> 13:17.266
"And then, a month or two later,
lends him some more money

13:17.333 --> 13:18.600
that he doesn't pay her back.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.400
And he doesn't pay her back
again for months.

13:21.467 --> 13:25.066
And still lives there and then have
a fight about something else?

13:25.133 --> 13:26.734
And have a bad breakup?"

13:26.800 --> 13:29.667
Well, you take that on the chin.
You have to learn your lesson.

13:29.734 --> 13:32.333
Otherwise, you deplete
your own bank account

13:32.400 --> 13:35.934
and your kids are gonna suffer
because you have to pay this dental bill

13:36.000 --> 13:37.734
for teeth that you can't enjoy.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.834
So I would've dismissed her claim,
actually,

13:40.900 --> 13:43.633
for the dental bill because
you live together,

13:43.700 --> 13:46.667
well after the dental work was completed.

13:46.734 --> 13:49.000
And you didn't pay for it
and you didn't pay one month,

13:49.066 --> 13:50.867
you didn't pay two months,
you didn't pay three months,

13:50.934 --> 13:52.834
and then she took you on a vacation.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.333
Do you understand?
You say...

13:55.767 --> 13:57.066
in that text...

13:57.533 --> 13:59.834
and I don't care what reason
you're gonna give me,

13:59.900 --> 14:02.767
that "I'm gonna pay for the dental work."

14:02.834 --> 14:03.934
That's what you say.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.433
I never said that I'm gonna
pay for the dental work.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.667
You didn't say
"I'm going to pay for the dental work."

14:09.734 --> 14:12.500
-[Lorenzo] Never said that.
-You said, "I'm going to get a check,

14:12.567 --> 14:14.934
I'm gonna pay you what I owe you.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.233
-She never--
-[Judy] And she's referring

14:17.433 --> 14:20.233
in the preceding paragraph
to dental work.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.700
No, that's an inference.

14:21.767 --> 14:23.300
She's not referring to that.

14:23.367 --> 14:24.834
Now just a second, may I see that please?

14:24.900 --> 14:27.867
I want to see if the word "dental" appears
anywhere in there.

14:27.934 --> 14:28.900
[Lorenzo] In my paragraph...

14:28.967 --> 14:30.633
It doesn't have to be in your paragraph.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.133
It has to be in here,
that's what the reference is about.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.266
Yeah.

14:35.333 --> 14:39.000
"The only thing you should be doing
is paying your dental bill."

14:39.066 --> 14:42.000
That's before, that she says,
and you answer her,

14:42.066 --> 14:45.000
"I'm going to hold up
my end of the bargain,"

14:45.066 --> 14:47.166
is what you mean,
but you don't speak English here.

14:47.233 --> 14:48.200
[audience chuckles]

14:48.266 --> 14:52.700
And she says, "Well, I can't trust you.
You have the money to pay me right now.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.767
And you're nit." Which
I suppose you mean "not".

14:55.834 --> 14:59.600
"Let me prove this to you.
I don't wanna use you.

14:59.667 --> 15:03.066
I want to pay you what I owe you
and when my check comes in,

15:03.133 --> 15:06.667
I'll get in that sober house."
That's what you're referring to.

15:06.734 --> 15:08.033
I wasn't referring to a dental bill.

15:08.100 --> 15:09.767
-[Judy] Well, what money--? Shh!
-[Lorenzo] Well, just in--

15:09.834 --> 15:12.166
What money were you referring to?

15:12.233 --> 15:15.233
About rent. About rent,
that's what I was talking about.

15:15.300 --> 15:16.800
I wasn't talking about a dental bill.

15:16.867 --> 15:19.667
Well, she was talking about a dental bill
and that's what you responded to.

15:19.734 --> 15:21.934
So I don't have to even go into this trip,

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
which I would've dismissed because
that's your problem. You were curious.

15:25.066 --> 15:28.100
So, but the dental bill
is well over $13,000.

15:28.166 --> 15:30.000
Now you have a counterclaim.

15:30.066 --> 15:31.300
Yes, I do.

15:31.367 --> 15:33.400
And that's an interesting counterclaim.

15:33.467 --> 15:37.467
You had a physical fight.
You allege in this physical fight

15:37.533 --> 15:40.834
that Miss Parra assaulted you so badly

15:40.900 --> 15:44.200
that you had to be in the hospital.
I want you to tell me about that.

15:44.266 --> 15:45.100
Yes.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.100
[dramatic music]

15:47.433 --> 15:50.867
He was taken to the hospital
by ambulance, I assume,

15:50.934 --> 15:54.000
because his head was bleeding
because you had hit him over the head

15:54.066 --> 15:54.967
with a speaker.

15:55.033 --> 15:56.100
-In self-defense.
-Yeah.

15:56.166 --> 15:57.900
-[Judy] Ah, think it was self-defense?
-Mm-hmm.

15:57.967 --> 15:59.700
But you had hit him over the head
with a speaker

15:59.767 --> 16:02.133
because the two of you were blotto drunk.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.834
[theme music plays]

16:14.266 --> 16:17.433
[narrator] <i>Christina Parra</i>
<i>is accusing former boyfriend</i>

16:17.500 --> 16:22.166
<i>Lorenzo Jordan of refusing to</i>
<i>pay his dental bill and travel costs.</i>

16:22.233 --> 16:23.767
Now, we're now on your counterclaim.

16:23.834 --> 16:26.767
And the reason why she said
she was getting child support,

16:26.834 --> 16:29.000
is because she no longer
has her kids because

16:29.066 --> 16:30.800
the incident happened
in front of her kids.

16:30.867 --> 16:32.600
Just a minute, would you tell me about...

16:32.667 --> 16:35.100
So the night we were talking,
we were drinking--

16:35.166 --> 16:39.266
[Judy] Give me, give me,
a month, day, and year.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.767
-June 30th, 2020th.
-[Judy] Okay.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.900
[Lorenzo] We were arguing
and going back and forth

16:43.967 --> 16:46.000
-and I wasn't paying attention.
-[Judy] Just a second.

16:46.066 --> 16:48.266
-Had you both been drinking?
-Yes, we were.

16:48.333 --> 16:50.567
[Judy] And you were arguing
back and forth about what?

16:50.633 --> 16:53.233
We argued so much
that I wouldn't even know

16:53.300 --> 16:54.166
what it was about.

16:54.233 --> 16:56.100
Okay, do you remember what
the argument was about?

16:56.166 --> 16:57.500
Yes, because I have a police report.

16:58.066 --> 17:00.066
-I'd like to see it please.
-[Christina] Absolutely.

17:00.367 --> 17:03.200
-[Lorenzo] And the police report--
-Shh!

17:03.266 --> 17:04.333
I can read.

17:19.233 --> 17:22.367
Okay, this is what I gather
from reading the police report.

17:22.433 --> 17:23.800
On the 20th of June,

17:23.867 --> 17:27.233
the two of you were clearly blotto drunk.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.800
And behaving in
a loud and boisterous manner

17:29.867 --> 17:31.767
and somebody else called the police.

17:31.834 --> 17:33.800
Not the two of you,
not either of the two of you.

17:33.867 --> 17:34.900
I called the police.

17:35.667 --> 17:37.400
'Cause my head was leaking blood.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.066
Nobody else had called the police?
Not a neighbor?

17:40.133 --> 17:42.934
-Probably so because it was so loud.
-[Judy] Probably so. Right.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.767
But the reason why they came
was because of me.

17:45.834 --> 17:48.433
I don't know if that's the reason
that they came because of you.

17:48.500 --> 17:52.500
Clearly, you had had some kind of
confrontation with neighbors before

17:52.567 --> 17:55.900
because this was not a first time
that the two of you were blotto

17:55.967 --> 17:57.533
and making a lot of noise.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.333
That's what I get from the police report.

18:00.133 --> 18:03.400
And it's clear from the police report,
Miss Parra,

18:03.467 --> 18:05.967
that you were uninjured.

18:06.033 --> 18:11.533
You had a slight scratch on your chest
according to the arresting officer.

18:11.600 --> 18:16.100
According to the police officer,
and a scratch on your hand.

18:16.166 --> 18:19.000
Neither of which you wanted filmed.

18:19.066 --> 18:21.600
-You gave me the police report. Right.
-[Christina] Mm-hmm.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.100
-It says--
-And then...

18:23.166 --> 18:25.233
the officers
tried to calm things down,

18:25.300 --> 18:26.800
told you to both be quiet.

18:26.867 --> 18:31.000
He was taken to the hospital
by ambulance, I assume,

18:31.066 --> 18:33.100
because his head was bleeding

18:33.166 --> 18:35.633
because you had hit him over the head
with a speaker.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.000
-In self-defense.
-[Judy] Yeah.

18:37.567 --> 18:39.233
-In self-defense?
-Ah, think it was self-defense?

18:39.300 --> 18:41.100
But you had hit him over the head
with a speaker

18:41.166 --> 18:43.300
because the two of you were blotto drunk.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.533
"Self-defense."

18:45.600 --> 18:46.533
Look at me, look at her.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.200
-Micro-wrestler.
-[Judy] I didn't ask you a question.

18:49.266 --> 18:51.533
-[Lorenzo] Okay, sorry about that.
-There's no question before you.

18:51.600 --> 18:52.600
Yes.

18:53.166 --> 18:56.633
Perfect. After he was taken away,

18:56.700 --> 19:00.767
you continued to behave in
a loud and belligerent way

19:00.834 --> 19:04.033
and open up the window from upstairs.

19:04.100 --> 19:05.367
I believe it's two different police
reports.

19:05.433 --> 19:08.300
[Judy] Just a--
They are two different police reports.

19:08.367 --> 19:11.400
And according to the police reports,
someone...

19:12.000 --> 19:14.400
out of one of those windows upstairs...

19:14.467 --> 19:16.600
So either it was you or a neighbor,

19:16.667 --> 19:21.900
but someone there threw a firework,
a lit firework,

19:21.967 --> 19:23.233
-out of the window.
-[Christina] He did.

19:23.300 --> 19:26.200
And it landed outside and went off.

19:26.266 --> 19:29.066
And you were continuing to be loud.

19:29.133 --> 19:32.967
So they called Social Services
because they feared

19:33.033 --> 19:35.834
for your three children
who were in the house.

19:35.900 --> 19:37.767
How old are your children?

19:37.834 --> 19:39.567
Fifteen, thirteen, and eight.

19:39.633 --> 19:41.467
And they removed the children?

19:41.533 --> 19:45.200
-They have, because--
-[Judy] Just say, "Removed the children."

19:45.266 --> 19:49.000
-Yes.
-And that was in June of 2020.

19:49.066 --> 19:51.567
-No.
-What day?

19:51.633 --> 19:53.734
-October.
-October what?

19:53.800 --> 19:54.800
October 6th.

19:54.867 --> 19:57.300
So, are you telling me that
they didn't remove

19:57.367 --> 20:00.300
the three children that night,
just for their safety?

20:00.367 --> 20:01.834
-No.
-[Judy] Oh.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.266
Not what I'm reading here.
Let's say that's true.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.433
So they conducted a hearing

20:06.500 --> 20:08.367
-in family court?
-Yes.

20:08.433 --> 20:09.734
And you testified?

20:09.800 --> 20:12.934
Yeah, uh, no, I did not
testify against myself. No.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.500
You didn't testify?

20:14.567 --> 20:15.934
Nope. My lawyer advised me not to.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.400
Was there a criminal proceeding
pending against you?

20:18.467 --> 20:19.734
No, there is not. Nope.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.266
-Was there?
-No.

20:21.333 --> 20:24.767
Well, then your lawyer can't tell you
not to testify against yourself.

20:24.834 --> 20:26.567
Lawyer said, "You don't have a case."

20:26.633 --> 20:29.000
Maybe, but there was no criminal
proceeding pending

20:29.066 --> 20:31.166
so you can't take the fifth amendment.

20:31.233 --> 20:34.066
You didn't commit a crime according to you
and you had never been arrested

20:34.133 --> 20:35.400
for assault, is that right?

20:35.467 --> 20:36.700
-Right.
-[Judy] Assaulting him.

20:36.767 --> 20:39.700
Okay. So the children are now
in the custody of who?

20:39.767 --> 20:40.767
Their father.

20:40.834 --> 20:43.233
And that is as a result of a court order?

20:43.300 --> 20:45.567
-Yes.
-And he did testify?

20:45.633 --> 20:47.266
-[Christina] Who?
-Their father.

20:47.333 --> 20:50.867
No. The-- I don't think you're
understanding what kind of court it was.

20:50.934 --> 20:52.367
There was no criminal charges.

20:52.433 --> 20:54.734
I'm not talking about criminal court,
I'm talking about family court.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.800
Family court. Yeah, so they...

20:56.867 --> 20:59.367
You mean, the judge just says,
"I think think that they should..."

20:59.433 --> 21:00.934
No, they thought the children--

21:01.000 --> 21:03.100
-What?
-The children. And they took the facts

21:03.166 --> 21:04.900
of what you have in your hand there,
the police report.

21:04.967 --> 21:07.433
[Judy] Just a second, are you telling me
that the judge didn't appoint

21:07.500 --> 21:09.467
-a law guardian for the three children?
-Yes, he did.

21:09.533 --> 21:10.633
Of course!

21:10.700 --> 21:13.400
I was in family court
a quarter of a century.

21:13.467 --> 21:15.734
-Yes, absolutely.
-The three children were represented

21:15.800 --> 21:18.467
by counsel.
Either the children, the older ones,

21:18.533 --> 21:20.767
testified or counsel for the children

21:20.834 --> 21:23.767
reported to the court that they had
interviewed the children

21:23.834 --> 21:25.967
and the children wish
to remain with their father

21:26.033 --> 21:28.700
because their mother...
is a nut!

21:29.266 --> 21:30.333
-She is.
-[sighs]

21:30.400 --> 21:33.066
-Do I look like I need any help from you?
-Sorry.

21:33.767 --> 21:35.600
It was based on his toxic behavior.

21:36.333 --> 21:37.433
Her co-dependency.

21:38.333 --> 21:39.400
I don't care.

21:39.934 --> 21:41.934
I'd like to see your hospital report.

21:44.600 --> 21:47.633
-This is just my...
-[Judy] Just let me look at it.

21:48.233 --> 21:52.066
Maybe you can gather,
but I'm not loving either one of you.

21:53.734 --> 21:56.700
This is a discharge.
Well, this doesn't help me at all.

21:57.033 --> 21:59.767
It doesn't tell me what
you were there for.

21:59.834 --> 22:01.834
Nothing. It says, "Discharge summary.

22:01.900 --> 22:04.100
General, no acute distress, awake..."

22:04.166 --> 22:07.500
Well, sir, you're asking this court

22:07.567 --> 22:11.734
to give you $5,000 on something
that doesn't tell me anything.

22:11.800 --> 22:14.400
You could've been admitted
for a gallbladder attack.

22:14.467 --> 22:15.467
No.

22:15.533 --> 22:16.934
-[laughs]
-The police report does a...

22:17.000 --> 22:19.367
No, no, no. Sir, pay attention.

22:19.433 --> 22:25.033
You want $5,000, you go to a little
trouble and ask Northshore System

22:25.100 --> 22:28.533
to get you a copy of your medical records
so I can read them.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.166
-Yes.
-[Judy] Well, you didn't.

22:30.633 --> 22:31.767
[whispering] You didn't.

22:32.767 --> 22:35.133
This is not evidence,
it doesn't tell me anything.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.600
You could've been admitted there
for a splinter in your finger.

22:37.667 --> 22:39.133
Would you return this to him, please?

22:39.800 --> 22:41.000
Thank you very much.

22:43.166 --> 22:46.333
Mr. Jordan,
you're gonna pay for your own teeth

22:46.400 --> 22:47.934
that you smile with and eat with.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.567
Judgment for the plaintiff in the amount
of $10,000.

22:50.633 --> 22:52.300
Your counterclaim's dismissed.
We're finished.

22:52.767 --> 22:53.900
-Thank you.
-[Kevin] Court adjourned.

22:56.200 --> 23:01.066
Well, she hit me over the head and caused
severe injury to my brain.

23:01.133 --> 23:02.667
If somebody's being abusive,

23:02.734 --> 23:04.834
stick with it the order of protection.
Don't drop it.

23:04.900 --> 23:07.734
A toxic and very co-dependent,
uh, relationship.

23:07.800 --> 23:10.233
I just tried to help somebody
and in the long run,

23:10.300 --> 23:11.867
I lost my children for it.

23:11.934 --> 23:13.066
Justice wasn't served.

23:14.100 --> 23:16.100
So I've learned a lot of things
since being here.

23:16.166 --> 23:18.834
Legal issues, legal concerns,

23:18.900 --> 23:21.533
but also social issues
and social norms,

23:21.600 --> 23:23.166
and one of the things I've learned

23:23.233 --> 23:27.467
is never lend a significant other money
without a written loan agreement.

23:27.533 --> 23:31.233
Because we've seen how they
turn badly far too often.

23:31.300 --> 23:33.633
You're right, and I especially wouldn't
lend a boyfriend money

23:33.700 --> 23:35.133
who didn't have a job.

23:37.867 --> 23:41.000
