00:04.704 --> 00:06.638
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.640 --> 00:10.709
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:10.711 --> 00:12.745
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.747 --> 00:15.347
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.349 --> 00:17.783
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:17.785 --> 00:20.185
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.187 --> 00:23.088
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>
<i>only we can solve.</i>

00:23.090 --> 00:25.024
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:25.026 --> 00:26.658
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.028
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:29.030 --> 00:31.363
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:33.532
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.534 --> 00:35.734
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:35.736 --> 00:38.570
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.572 --> 00:40.506
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:41.775 --> 00:43.809
(ship horn blows)

00:50.383 --> 00:53.052
Remind me what we're doing here
in this heat.

00:53.054 --> 00:55.054
Taking a day off.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.823
It's good for you,
clear your head.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.459
Passing h.R. B6a
would clear my head.

01:00.461 --> 01:04.363
You ruin my day of sunshine,
and I will fire you.

01:04.365 --> 01:05.831
Aye aye, congressman.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.400
Go ahead, cast off.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.668
(engine starts)

01:09.670 --> 01:11.470
The rope.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.741
â™ª

01:28.688 --> 01:30.289
I can see the appeal
of this place.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.623
You're missing the point.

01:31.625 --> 01:34.093
It's about getting away
from it all.

01:34.095 --> 01:36.428
You know,
now that we have some time,

01:36.430 --> 01:38.664
I've been meaning
to ask you...

01:43.570 --> 01:46.772
All right. A little to the left.

01:46.774 --> 01:50.175
Keep her coming back. Careful.
This is precious cargo.

01:50.177 --> 01:51.577
Sylvester: Happy, just slow
down. Just take your time.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.512
You know how fragile and
important this is, okay?

01:53.514 --> 01:55.414
Toby:
Keep it coming back.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.249
Straight through.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.353
Hey.
Is that it?

02:01.355 --> 02:02.888
Walter:
<i>Now, we've all been working</i>

02:02.890 --> 02:04.890
Very hard.

02:04.892 --> 02:08.894
So, for our reward...

02:11.197 --> 02:12.631
Oh...
Oh!

02:12.633 --> 02:13.832
Sylvester:
An authentic original

02:13.834 --> 02:16.168
Proton arnold cabinet?

02:16.170 --> 02:17.536
Walter, it's beautiful.

02:19.506 --> 02:21.907
Happy:
It's all original hardware.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.909
It still takes quarters.
You can fix that, right?

02:23.911 --> 02:25.377
Do not insult me.

02:25.379 --> 02:26.378
Drew:
Cool.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.247
I loved that game.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.882
Hey.
Hey.

02:29.884 --> 02:31.316
Your dad's gonna
take you to school.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.352
Walter:
Hey.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.720
It's okay.
When you get back from school,

02:34.722 --> 02:36.221
You'll have first game.

02:36.223 --> 02:37.856
Okay? Go.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.225
Before we go,
I just want

02:40.227 --> 02:41.393
To have a quick
word with walter.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.228
Okay.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.932
Yeah, sure.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.735
I used to crush that game.
What was your high score?

02:49.737 --> 02:50.936
Oh, I don't know.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.571
At a certain point,
the counter resets.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.474
Cool.

02:55.476 --> 02:56.942
So, look, I wanted to thank you

02:56.944 --> 02:58.877
For the pitching seminar
we gave ralph last week.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.913
The kinetic
diagnostic analysis.

03:00.915 --> 03:02.948
Yeah. It's really helped us.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.583
I mean, we do these
game scenarios now.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.619
Like, what's the best opening
pitch with three on, two out,

03:07.621 --> 03:10.622
Facing a .280 hitter with
a .330 on-base percentage?

03:10.624 --> 03:11.623
That's interesting.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.358
Yeah, look, also...

03:13.360 --> 03:15.360
You really helped my delivery.

03:15.362 --> 03:18.597
I picked up three miles an hour
on my fastball.

03:18.599 --> 03:19.865
I called my agent.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.234
He got me a tryout
with the portland sea dogs.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.770
It's double-a, but still.

03:26.372 --> 03:27.773
Portland?

03:27.775 --> 03:28.874
Mm-hmm.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.909
Does, uh, does paige
know about this?

03:30.911 --> 03:32.678
Drew: Not yet.
Not until it's real.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.913
The only reason I'm telling you
is because you probably know

03:34.915 --> 03:37.282
Ralph's mind
better than anyone.

03:37.284 --> 03:40.686
You're asking what it will
do to him if you leave.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.521
Or bring them with me.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.556
And, look, we're a long
way away from that,

03:44.558 --> 03:46.792
And ralph is
my priority, but...

03:46.794 --> 03:49.995
Well, I don't have a ready
answer for you, so...

03:49.997 --> 03:51.463
Well, it's hypothetical,
you know.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.232
I still have to try out.

03:53.234 --> 03:54.800
But, um, just think about it.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.468
Okay.
All right?

03:56.470 --> 03:58.003
And keep it
between us.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.339
Mm-hmm.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.441
Ralph, ready?

04:05.411 --> 04:06.545
Bye.

04:06.547 --> 04:09.381
Come on.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.452
Hey.

04:13.454 --> 04:14.753
(door closes)

04:14.755 --> 04:17.389
Ride with me to kovelsky's.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.658
Let's grab some bagels
for the team.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.031
I had my eye on
you and drew.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.432
Looks like you're
getting along well.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.268
Yes.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.436
Real convincing, 197.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.505
I'm preoccupied with
a greater good scenario.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.774
Complicated by
personal involvement?

04:35.776 --> 04:37.676
I know the challenges
of mentoring

04:37.678 --> 04:39.745
A child genius,
remember?

04:41.447 --> 04:43.315
(phone rings)
what's that say?

04:44.517 --> 04:46.585
It's from "r." it says "gumbo."

04:46.587 --> 04:49.321
Text back: "confirm."

04:49.323 --> 04:51.790
"gumbo confirmed."

04:51.792 --> 04:54.526
Whatever I tell you to do, you
just do it for your own safety.

04:54.528 --> 04:57.296
"gumbo" is
an emergency code word.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.463
From who? Who's "r"?

04:58.465 --> 05:00.432
Questions will be
answered soon enough.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.567
(tires screeching)

05:10.076 --> 05:12.644
Walter: <i>You just did</i>
<i>18 evasive driving maneuvers.</i>

05:12.646 --> 05:14.413
<i>Are you gonna tell me</i>
<i>what's going on?</i>

05:14.415 --> 05:15.881
Stay here.

05:15.883 --> 05:16.982
Curb your curiosity.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.417
Cabe...

05:29.896 --> 05:31.563
(three knocks, one knock)

05:36.936 --> 05:39.104
Cabe.

05:44.644 --> 05:49.014
I probably shouldn't have
reached out like this...

05:49.016 --> 05:52.384
Out of the blue,
after so much time.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.654
15 years.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.422
Your family--

05:57.424 --> 05:59.091
I know you remarried--
are they safe?

05:59.093 --> 06:02.527
My husband took our daughter
back east to look at colleges.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.096
I just...

06:04.098 --> 06:06.665
I didn't want to scare them
unnecessarily.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.101
With what? Tell me
what's happening, rebecca.

06:09.103 --> 06:12.404
I'm in-house counsel
at a big lobbying firm.

06:12.406 --> 06:15.407
I think I stumbled
on something very illegal,

06:15.409 --> 06:18.377
And now I'm in trouble.

06:18.379 --> 06:21.012
You know I would never call you
unless I had to.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.415
You can always call me.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.449
(footsteps outside)

06:24.451 --> 06:25.517
Cabe...

06:29.155 --> 06:31.423
(exhales)

06:31.425 --> 06:33.692
It's okay. He's with me.

06:35.661 --> 06:36.828
Damn it, walter.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.497
What are you...?

06:38.499 --> 06:39.998
What is going on here?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.967
Wait, is this...

06:41.969 --> 06:43.435
Walter o'brien?

06:43.437 --> 06:44.403
Yes, it is.

06:44.405 --> 06:45.904
And you are?

06:45.906 --> 06:49.841
This is rebecca. Burns.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.910
My ex-wife.

06:56.015 --> 06:58.083
Someone's trying to kill her.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.488
Part of my job at
the barnwright group

07:03.490 --> 07:05.857
Is to review our clients'
pac contributions.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.193
This morning, I came
across a wire transfer

07:08.195 --> 07:11.797
Made two weeks ago labeled:
"ca 78 se"

07:11.799 --> 07:12.798
Okay.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.499
I had no clue
what that meant,

07:14.501 --> 07:18.804
There were a number of
contributions but no names,

07:18.806 --> 07:21.173
Which is a huge red flag.

07:21.175 --> 07:23.542
So I copied the file
onto a flash drive

07:23.544 --> 07:24.976
To run it by
our co-counsel.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.678
But when I went
to print it,

07:26.680 --> 07:27.712
The file was gone.

07:27.714 --> 07:28.980
Money laundering?

07:28.982 --> 07:30.182
That's my guess.

07:30.184 --> 07:31.583
I guarantee barnwright

07:31.585 --> 07:32.818
Monitors their
whole system.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.486
As soon as you
opened the file,

07:34.488 --> 07:36.455
They knew you were
looking at it.

07:36.457 --> 07:39.057
They had an override word
macro triggered to delete it.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.225
They certainly knew something.

07:40.227 --> 07:44.496
A security officer in a suit
stopped me in the hall.

07:44.498 --> 07:47.165
I'd never seen him before,
but he had a gun.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.234
He wanted to frisk me,
but a couple of staffers

07:49.236 --> 07:51.603
Walked by
before he had a chance.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.505
While he was rifling
through my bag,

07:53.507 --> 07:55.907
I dropped the flash drive
in the nearest planter.

07:55.909 --> 07:59.177
Then when I got home,
I saw a man

07:59.179 --> 08:01.813
Walk out of my bedroom
wearing a mask.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.548
He ran at me.

08:03.550 --> 08:05.984
I barely got
to my car.

08:07.954 --> 08:10.689
I didn't know
who else to turn to.

08:10.691 --> 08:14.659
We established the emergency
code word for a reason.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.695
I'm glad you reached out to me.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.964
After all this time, I'm...

08:18.966 --> 08:20.866
I'm just glad you remembered it.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.067
May I see your phone?

08:30.543 --> 08:31.776
Cabe:
Okay.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.880
He's uncouth
but effective.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.949
We're gonna have to get rid
of any trace of you.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.718
We're gonna leave your car.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.152
You're gonna ride with us.

08:55.001 --> 08:56.234
(talking quietly)

08:56.236 --> 08:57.636
Here they come.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.638
Toby:
Intelligent eyes.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.873
Clearly has
a wit about her.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.909
Same carriage as cabe.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.744
They actually
make a good match.

09:05.746 --> 09:08.179
Toby, happy,

09:08.181 --> 09:10.882
Sylvester, paige.

09:10.884 --> 09:11.883
My ex-wife rebecca.

09:11.885 --> 09:15.086
You were punching
way above your weight class.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.688
Hello.
I'm sylvester.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.623
I apologize if I am
inordinately anxious.

09:18.625 --> 09:19.824
The pleasure's mine.

09:19.826 --> 09:21.793
(video game beeping)
what's that?

09:22.762 --> 09:23.862
That is proton arnold.

09:23.864 --> 09:24.729
Unplug it.

09:24.731 --> 09:25.997
Okay.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.832
Rebecca: I think what
cabe means to say is,

09:27.834 --> 09:30.835
"I've told my ex-wife
what a great team I work with--

09:30.837 --> 09:32.103
Smartest I'll ever meet."

09:32.105 --> 09:33.672
You're a cabe whisperer.

09:33.674 --> 09:38.043
All right, now that
the meet and greet's over.

09:38.045 --> 09:42.948
"ca 78 se"

09:42.950 --> 09:45.116
Decoding that is the key
to the file rebecca found

09:45.118 --> 09:46.851
And whoever came after her.

09:46.853 --> 09:49.054
"ca" is most likely
california.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.789
Happy:
78-- a year,

09:50.791 --> 09:52.057
A longitude,

09:52.059 --> 09:54.125
A state highway

09:54.127 --> 09:55.727
Or exit on any
interstate.

09:55.729 --> 09:59.097
And "se" could be southeast,
southern England.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.232
Or "something else."

10:01.234 --> 10:04.903
California, 78,
something else.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.175
You literally called us on this
three minutes ago.

10:11.877 --> 10:15.213
All barnwright clients are
multi-billion dollar outfits.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.848
Agricultural companies,

10:16.850 --> 10:18.650
Airline unions, 50 others.

10:18.652 --> 10:19.818
Hard to know which one

10:19.820 --> 10:21.353
Has their values up their ass.

10:21.355 --> 10:22.821
Boy, you're tough
as nails.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.222
Guess you'd have to be
to be married to cabe.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.724
Moving on.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.726
So, you said when you
returned to your computer

10:27.728 --> 10:29.728
Seconds later, the suspicious
file was deleted.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.797
That means whoever set it up
programmed a trojan horse

10:32.799 --> 10:34.265
To destroy all data viewed
by unauthorized personnel.

10:34.267 --> 10:38.370
Might be that one you left
in the planter at barnwright.

10:38.372 --> 10:41.673
Cabe, you got
to be patient.

10:41.675 --> 10:42.807
Guys, look at this.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.042
(over tv):
Investigators have concluded

10:44.044 --> 10:45.744
That the explosion
was the result

10:45.746 --> 10:47.712
Of an equipment malfunction
aboard the vessel.

10:47.714 --> 10:50.248
Congressman gostin
was a firebrand champion

10:50.250 --> 10:53.785
Making him
a nationally recognized figure,

10:53.787 --> 10:57.055
To the constituents
in the 78th district.

10:57.057 --> 11:00.191
"ca" stands for california;
"78" stands for 78th district.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.893
What does "se" stand for?

11:01.895 --> 11:03.895
"special election."

11:03.897 --> 11:06.898
Isn't that what happens when
a congressman dies in office?

11:06.900 --> 11:08.233
That's what I saw in that file--

11:08.235 --> 11:09.834
Contributions
for a special election.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.069
But a special
election is only held

11:11.071 --> 11:14.439
When an incumbent dies
or is removed from office.

11:14.441 --> 11:17.375
They removed him
from office.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.744
Whoever created that
account was raising money

11:19.746 --> 11:23.281
To replace congressman gostin
before today's accident.

11:23.283 --> 11:26.284
So, either they are
clairvoyant, or...

11:26.286 --> 11:28.053
This was an assassination.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.822
But why start transferring funds
before knocking him off?

11:30.824 --> 11:32.924
You're just putting
yourself in a position

11:32.926 --> 11:34.893
To be caught;
that's not too smart.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.761
A congressman is dead.

11:36.763 --> 11:39.097
Cabe, would now be the time
to call in reinforcements?

11:39.099 --> 11:41.099
We're dealing with one of
the largest lobbying firms

11:41.101 --> 11:42.100
In the country.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.368
They have tentacles everywhere--

11:43.370 --> 11:44.836
They pull in
big government money.

11:44.838 --> 11:47.839
Big enough to want
to kill a congressman.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.275
We need to be completely
off the grid on this one.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.477
We have to get ahold of that
drive you left at barnwright.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.878
That's probably
the only way of tracing

11:53.880 --> 11:56.181
Whoever wanted gostin dead.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.415
You still have your I.D.?

11:57.417 --> 12:00.452
I'm sure they deactivated it.

12:00.454 --> 12:04.956
Speaking of badges, cabe,
I'm gonna need yours.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.826
To look at that exploded
boat for proof of foul play.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.327
There'll be security
at the marina.

12:11.197 --> 12:14.466
Since when do you
loan your shield

12:14.468 --> 12:16.935
So people can
impersonate federal agents?

12:16.937 --> 12:19.938
Since someone came after you.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.941
I want you by my side;
it's the only place that's safe.

12:28.848 --> 12:30.115
(scanner beeps)

12:32.084 --> 12:33.885
(scanner beeps)

12:36.756 --> 12:38.790
I'm in.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.191
Good.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.893
Making my way
to the fifth floor.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.194
Get in and get out, walter.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.929
No unnecessary risk.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.865
Assume everyone you meet
in that building is a threat.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.767
These the kind of jobs
you guys normally do?

12:48.769 --> 12:50.802
Mm, yeah, we break
and enter a lot.

12:52.471 --> 12:54.038
He was always very gutsy.

13:00.412 --> 13:02.480
So, rebecca said that there was

13:02.482 --> 13:04.816
A third plant
from the elevator, huh?

13:04.818 --> 13:05.917
Cabe:
That's right.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.018
Make it fast.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.987
Is that your daughter?

13:08.989 --> 13:10.321
Joanna.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.556
She's beautiful.
How old?

13:11.558 --> 13:15.827
When I picture that man tearing
through my house this morning,

13:15.829 --> 13:18.797
More than anything, I'm so happy
that she wasn't home.

13:18.799 --> 13:19.931
She was such a cute baby.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.466
Look at those cheeks.

13:26.005 --> 13:27.539
No, that-that's amanda.

13:27.541 --> 13:30.175
That's our daughter
who passed away.

13:30.177 --> 13:33.878
Oh, I-I'm so sorry
for your loss.

13:33.880 --> 13:38.016
So, cabe, there's nothing
in that planter. Is she sure?

13:38.018 --> 13:39.484
I thought so,
but I was so nervous.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.485
He needs to be
careful, cabe.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.453
These are not good people.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.122
(quietly):
Well, is she sure?

13:44.124 --> 13:46.825
I mean, this is...

13:48.260 --> 13:50.295
Who are you?

13:50.297 --> 13:51.896
Cabe: Tell him you're looking
for human resources

13:51.898 --> 13:53.364
And get out of there now,
walter.

13:53.366 --> 13:56.501
Hi, I'm dave
from ucla botany department.

13:56.503 --> 14:00.004
Operations called about
a-a fungus in the, uh, plants.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.073
That's not what I told you
to say, walter, damn it!

14:02.075 --> 14:05.910
Well, dave from ucla, you're
gonna need to come with me.

14:05.912 --> 14:07.278
I'm almost done
with the samples.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.948
Just, uh, one
left actually.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.950
You're done now. Let's go.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.552
Walter, if that's the guy
that tried to frisk rebecca,

14:14.554 --> 14:16.254
He could be very dangerous.

14:16.256 --> 14:19.190
I-I can't do what
you're asking me to do now.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.626
I've... It's almost finished.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.094
Get out of there now, walter!

14:23.096 --> 14:24.162
Sir.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.140
Security breach on five!

14:36.142 --> 14:37.575
Man, blue shirt, gray pants!

14:37.577 --> 14:38.977
Walter, what's happening?

14:38.979 --> 14:40.411
I'm in a bit of a bind here.

14:40.413 --> 14:43.281
But I'm buying some time
by jamming some coins

14:43.283 --> 14:45.316
Into the door frame.

14:47.319 --> 14:49.087
That's not gonna hold for long.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.256
That's why I told you
to get out when I did.

14:52.157 --> 14:54.192
Open up!

14:54.194 --> 14:56.461
(banging)

14:56.463 --> 14:58.129
Open the door!

14:58.131 --> 15:01.599
You move your car to the side
alley off fourth street.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.101
Keep the car running
and stand by.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.169
(tires screeching)

15:09.308 --> 15:10.408
Okay, we're here.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.177
Where the
hell's walter?

15:13.179 --> 15:15.246
There.

15:18.984 --> 15:22.954
Paige: Oh, my god, walter,
what are you doing?

15:22.956 --> 15:25.023
Son of a bitch!

15:25.025 --> 15:27.158
You got to kick it
into high gear, son!

15:27.160 --> 15:29.961
Cut the power to the rig!
Let's get down there.

15:29.963 --> 15:32.263
I'll be down in 20 seconds.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.098
Ah! They killed the motor.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.167
Cabe:
There's no guarantee.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.635
You get arrested,
you're gonna have an accident

15:37.637 --> 15:39.003
Before you get
to the police station!

15:39.005 --> 15:40.238
You got to get out!

15:40.240 --> 15:41.306
You know what,
I'm 30 feet above concrete!

15:41.308 --> 15:42.540
Give me time to think!

15:42.542 --> 15:44.042
You don't have any time!

15:44.044 --> 15:45.677
Quiet! I'm doing
my calculations.

15:45.679 --> 15:47.578
Pull your car up
two-and-a-half feet.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.114
Create a freefall, 9.8
meters per seconds squared.

15:50.116 --> 15:50.949
Hurry!

15:50.951 --> 15:54.152
What is he doing?

15:54.154 --> 15:56.287
4,000 newtons of energy
to break a leg.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.490
I should be okay...

15:59.492 --> 16:01.559
But I'm not paying
for the damage to your car!

16:04.296 --> 16:06.731
Okay, we can go now.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.000
(tires screeching)

16:17.209 --> 16:18.443
Cabe...
What happened in there?!

16:18.445 --> 16:21.079
We needed this drive.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.281
When I tell you to
get out, you get out.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.416
You risked rebecca's life,
you risked your life,

16:25.418 --> 16:27.051
And now they've seen
your face, walter!

16:27.053 --> 16:29.187
They've got it on surveillance!

16:29.189 --> 16:31.389
We don't know what
the repercussions are from that!

16:31.391 --> 16:34.459
Cabe...
Hey, it's okay.

16:38.130 --> 16:40.064
(engine starts)

16:41.033 --> 16:43.234
(tires screeching)

16:44.670 --> 16:46.371
Man (over radio):
It's 102 in the southland today.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.272
Hope you brought your sunblock.

16:48.274 --> 16:51.242
Did you guys remember
to apply your sunblock?

16:51.244 --> 16:52.343
Yeah, right after
we took our vitamins.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.512
Happy: Guys, focus.
Right, sorry.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.381
You're the shrink.
I need you on point, doc.

16:56.383 --> 17:00.084
I'm on it. Based on posture
alone, this guy's an easy mark.

17:00.086 --> 17:01.252
How you doing today?

17:01.254 --> 17:03.121
Good. How you doing?

17:03.123 --> 17:05.123
I'm in a marina
in triple-digit heat.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.524
How do you think I'm doing?

17:06.526 --> 17:08.326
Agent gallo,
homeland security.

17:08.328 --> 17:11.062
What kind of name is "cabe"?

17:14.266 --> 17:15.633
It's "kah-beh."

17:16.735 --> 17:19.203
My mother's korean.
Oh, sorry.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.305
I-I didn't mean anything by it.
No one ever does.

17:21.307 --> 17:22.473
This is perfect.

17:22.475 --> 17:23.808
Now he's feeling guilty
and self-conscious.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.276
Drop a little
civics lesson.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.178
I'm here to do
the dhs inspection.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.346
Inspectors were already here.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.348
Local pd was.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.382
Not us.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.784
A congressman died.

17:32.786 --> 17:34.419
Homeland's involved.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.720
This is perfect.
Now he's feeling stupid.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.355
You got him right
where you want him.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.357
Now make him insecure.

17:39.359 --> 17:42.693
I have work to do, so should I
call your supervisor or mine?

17:44.096 --> 17:45.396
And shoulders
will be slouching

17:45.398 --> 17:48.166
In three, two, one.

17:50.702 --> 17:52.070
This is like
fish in a barrel.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.805
Good talk.

18:22.468 --> 18:24.769
It's clean.

18:26.738 --> 18:28.739
Walter:
Hey, happy.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.441
Hey, walt. How'd you guys do?

18:30.443 --> 18:31.442
Oh, we got the drive,

18:31.444 --> 18:32.810
But we need more evidence.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.145
So how is the marina?

18:34.147 --> 18:35.413
Informative.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.348
I think I have
what you're looking for.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.417
So, small crafts like gostin's
have gas engines, right?

18:39.419 --> 18:41.886
Their fumes have to be
cleaned out by a motorized fan

18:41.888 --> 18:43.454
To avoid an explosion.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.289
Now, if someone
were to cut the hose

18:45.291 --> 18:46.390
Between the motor and the fan...

18:46.392 --> 18:47.792
Fan would still be making noise,

18:47.794 --> 18:49.527
But it wouldn't actually
be blowing any fumes out.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.196
Precisely. And if the fumes
aren't being vented, boom.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.731
So, you found a cut fan hose?

18:53.733 --> 18:55.366
Better.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.368
Whoever cut the hose
on the congressman's boat

18:57.370 --> 18:58.503
Was smart enough to replace it.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.505
They charred the outside
of the hose

19:00.507 --> 19:02.673
So authorities wouldn't notice
it had been tampered with.

19:02.675 --> 19:05.443
Trouble is, there should've
been fume residue inside.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.879
But the hose is clean--
it's never been used.

19:07.881 --> 19:10.448
It was clearly installed
after the boat exploded.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.517
And a brand-new part
would mean a recent purchase.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.552
So, we just need to link
whoever bought that part

19:14.554 --> 19:16.654
To someone on the client roster
of rebecca's firm.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.556
Happy, we'll meet you
back at the garage.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.158
Race you there.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.695
Appreciate the loan.

19:26.465 --> 19:28.266
What the hell
happened in here?

19:29.234 --> 19:32.170
Toby:
I can't believe this.

19:33.305 --> 19:35.439
Sylvester:
No. Proton arnold.

19:36.775 --> 19:37.842
They're onto us.

19:47.753 --> 19:48.853
It's like a tornado
came through.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.555
A tornado that hates computers.

19:50.557 --> 19:51.822
And arcade games.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.425
They took everything--
laptops, hard drives.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.526
Surge protectors.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.961
Who steals
surge protectors?!

19:56.963 --> 19:58.829
It's a good thing our
standard operating procedure

19:58.831 --> 20:00.498
Is to heavily encrypt all data.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.400
My house, your garage-- they're
hitting everything today.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.302
Okay, so the question
is: Why do all this?

20:04.304 --> 20:06.270
Why not lay in wait

20:06.272 --> 20:09.207
They know we have it;
they'll be back for it.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.308
We need to move.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.609
Oh, god.

20:11.611 --> 20:12.944
I know someplace.

20:12.946 --> 20:15.246
Grab everything
you think you need.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.480
We're heading out in 30 seconds.

20:16.482 --> 20:17.915
Hold on, guys.
Cell phones.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.517
On the desk now.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.452
So they can't
be tracked.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.888
Now, we're going off-grid,
but we still need phones. Happy?

20:23.890 --> 20:25.423
I'm on it.

20:28.527 --> 20:29.994
I want to pull ralph
out of school.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.329
Drew can take him
someplace safe.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.430
That's smart.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.365
It's better to be safe
than sorry.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.267
Untraceable burners.

20:36.269 --> 20:38.636
Great.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.373
All right, let's move out.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.380
This is harriman road.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.917
We're going to
jimmy's house.

20:54.621 --> 20:57.321
No one for you
to worry about.

21:11.536 --> 21:14.538
Uninhabited.
What's the story?

21:14.540 --> 21:16.641
We needed off the grid.
That's the story.

21:18.577 --> 21:21.946
Safe house? It's more
like a haunted house.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.615
You see what I did there,
right? That's a joke.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.758
(grunts)

21:36.962 --> 21:38.496
My kind of key.

21:38.498 --> 21:41.332
Ms. Quinn, would
you do the honors?

21:41.334 --> 21:43.334
With pleasure.

21:43.336 --> 21:44.602
There you go.

21:48.540 --> 21:51.442
Oh, dear lord,
thank you for this gift.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.914
Paige, sylvester, there's
a fuse box and a generator

21:56.916 --> 21:58.916
In the cellar,
down the hall to the right.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.051
Sure thing.

22:00.053 --> 22:03.054
Oh, '97-- a fine vintage
for dinty moore.

22:03.056 --> 22:06.557
Put that down!

22:06.559 --> 22:08.359
You do understand
that we're hiding?

22:08.361 --> 22:10.061
These people have
technology and connections.

22:10.063 --> 22:11.962
If they want
to find us, they will.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.564
We want to wrap
this up fast.

22:13.566 --> 22:16.534
Happy, set up an untraceable
internet connection.

22:16.536 --> 22:20.037
Well, we've got evidence of
the suspicious wire transfer

22:20.039 --> 22:21.872
On the flash drive,
but we need to link it

22:21.874 --> 22:23.708
To whoever bought
that hose.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.677
Now, we'll dig into records
of every boat supply store

22:26.679 --> 22:28.679
In southern california
and the top ten

22:28.681 --> 22:29.680
Online retailers.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.582
Toby: Then, once
we have a list,

22:31.584 --> 22:33.451
We can pull the name
of every barnwright client

22:33.453 --> 22:34.885
From that flash drive
and compare it

22:34.887 --> 22:37.621
With the hose purchasers,
see if anyone overlaps.

22:37.623 --> 22:39.623
(sighs, chuckles)

22:39.625 --> 22:41.559
Simple human error-- always is.

22:41.561 --> 22:42.560
What is?

22:42.562 --> 22:43.561
Walter:
The transfer rebecca saw

22:43.563 --> 22:44.762
For "ca 78 se"

22:44.764 --> 22:46.597
Was made on 11/12.

22:46.599 --> 22:49.066
Safe money's on
a simple digit inversion.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.836
Whoever entered that
meant to do it on 12/11.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.604
After the congressman
was dead,

22:53.606 --> 22:55.606
Once that special
election had been set.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.742
This whole thing is very
all the president's men.

22:57.744 --> 22:59.410
I feel like
I'm giving off

22:59.412 --> 23:00.911
A real robert redford
vibe right now.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.480
You're more of
a dustin hoffman.

23:02.482 --> 23:03.547
I will take that.

23:04.449 --> 23:05.783
Cabe:
We got an old saying

23:05.785 --> 23:08.018
In law enforcement
about the criminal element:

23:08.020 --> 23:09.954
"thank god
they're stupid."

23:14.726 --> 23:16.794
Um, start working
on this now.

23:29.674 --> 23:31.609
There is no jimmy, is there?

23:31.611 --> 23:33.677
This is your house,
yours and cabe.

23:33.679 --> 23:34.678
How'd you know?

23:34.680 --> 23:36.647
Coffee mug upside down

23:36.649 --> 23:38.983
On a neatly folded paper
towel near the sink.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.918
He does the same thing
every day at the garage.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.420
And your hand
was just shaking.

23:42.422 --> 23:45.122
It hasn't done once all day,
but it was just then.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.624
He always said you were

23:46.626 --> 23:48.793
The most observant person
he'd ever met.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.094
Now, he lied
about the house

23:50.096 --> 23:51.595
Because he didn't
want us prying.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.697
This is where...

23:53.699 --> 23:55.699
Things fell apart.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.034
You don't want
to be here.

23:57.036 --> 23:59.437
We'll work fast.
Walter...

23:59.439 --> 24:01.639
You do understand

24:01.641 --> 24:04.642
How important you are to him.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.644
That's what that
was all about,

24:06.646 --> 24:08.879
In the car earlier,
when he yelled at you.

24:08.881 --> 24:12.216
He had the same look in his eyes
as he did when we were told

24:12.218 --> 24:15.119
There was nothing more
we could do for amanda.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.688
He's not just worried
about me today.

24:17.690 --> 24:21.058
He doesn't want
to lose you.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.693
Happy:
Walter!

24:29.167 --> 24:30.668
List of californians
who purchased

24:30.670 --> 24:32.770
That exact model hose
in the last three months.

24:32.772 --> 24:37.007
Now, 11 of those buyers paid
with credit or debit cards.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.510
But none of those 11 names
have any direct ties

24:39.512 --> 24:41.011
To barnwright or
any of their clients.

24:41.013 --> 24:43.647
So we're focusing on the
one cash transaction.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.649
Okay, so that's got to be
our guy. What store?

24:45.651 --> 24:47.918
Lake and ocean boat supplies
in marina del rey,

24:47.920 --> 24:50.821
Two weeks ago at 3:15.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.690
Sylvester, can you access
their security archive footage?

24:52.692 --> 24:53.958
On it.

25:01.601 --> 25:05.102
There's a lot more on here
than just the barnwright file.

25:05.104 --> 25:08.205
There's a folder
full of letters to you.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.808
Multiple drafts,
going back almost 15 years.

25:10.810 --> 25:14.178
I only read the first sentence,
when I realized what it was.

25:14.180 --> 25:17.047
I thought you should
read it for yourself.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.952
(door closes)

25:23.555 --> 25:25.890
(door opens)

25:25.892 --> 25:28.726
Checked up on your family.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.294
But they made all
their appointments.

25:30.296 --> 25:31.762
They're at
their hotel now.

25:31.764 --> 25:32.763
Thank you.

25:32.765 --> 25:35.266
I appreciate it.

25:35.268 --> 25:37.768
When we split up,

25:37.770 --> 25:39.837
You let me have everything.

25:39.839 --> 25:42.573
All you asked for
was this house.

25:42.575 --> 25:44.842
Don't forget about
the '73 le mans.

25:48.813 --> 25:52.816
I always assumed
you'd sell the place.

25:52.818 --> 25:54.885
No, I'll never sell it.

25:56.821 --> 25:58.255
(sighs)

26:00.191 --> 26:02.226
This is where she took
her first steps.

26:02.228 --> 26:05.963
This is where
she died.

26:07.899 --> 26:10.167
It's killing
me to be here.

26:10.169 --> 26:13.804
Right now, this is
the safest place.

26:13.806 --> 26:17.041
I was so impressed
with you today.

26:17.043 --> 26:19.109
I thought, there's
the man I married,

26:19.111 --> 26:20.978
There's that swagger.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.880
I feel safe.

26:24.816 --> 26:28.152
But then... This.

26:28.154 --> 26:31.989
It brought up all
these old feelings.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.958
From when I couldn't
count on you.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.594
Cabe. We got... Something.

26:36.596 --> 26:37.962
(sighs)

26:42.968 --> 26:45.636
I'm fine.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.705
I just need to
get some air.

26:55.313 --> 26:57.381
Belongs to you.

27:06.324 --> 27:09.760
Here's the archived footage
from the boat supply store.

27:09.762 --> 27:12.830
Of when the pipe was
purchased...
Cabe:
Stop.

27:12.832 --> 27:15.265
What's that?

27:15.267 --> 27:16.834
There's our man.

27:16.836 --> 27:19.269
Got him.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.005
Does he pop up
in dmv records?

27:21.007 --> 27:23.340
No, but he pops up
somewhere else.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.976
Meet our buyer,
one anthony cole.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.778
That name showed up
in the clients

27:27.780 --> 27:29.947
I pulled from
rebecca's flash drive.

27:29.949 --> 27:32.750
Barnwright represents a
big agribusiness venture

27:32.752 --> 27:34.018
Called sundorna farms.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.686
There's a cole high
up in that company.

27:35.688 --> 27:37.154
Happy:
You are correct.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.957
Ben cole, vp of operations
at sundorna farms.

27:39.959 --> 27:42.026
Brother of the man
who purchased that hose.

27:42.028 --> 27:44.395
But anthony doesn't work
for the family business.

27:44.397 --> 27:47.031
No, he's been working
on quite the record.

27:47.033 --> 27:48.966
Theft, aggravated assault...

27:48.968 --> 27:50.768
Hang on a second.
You just said "farm."

27:50.770 --> 27:52.836
What...
This is about farms?

27:52.838 --> 27:56.306
It seems like the congressman
was a fierce defender

27:56.308 --> 27:57.975
Of small farmer water rights.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.710
Defending them from what?

27:59.712 --> 28:02.212
Big agribusiness,
like sundorna.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.815
They need the water, and gostin
was trying to push through

28:04.817 --> 28:06.150
A water redistribution bill.

28:06.152 --> 28:07.885
He was gonna turn off the tap.

28:07.887 --> 28:08.919
Sylvester: And at
stake for sundorna?

28:08.921 --> 28:09.920
More than $5 billion

28:09.922 --> 28:11.321
In lost revenue.

28:11.323 --> 28:12.856
Less water, fewer crops.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.925
Fewer crops, less money--
simple math.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.860
Gostin was taking cash
out of their pockets,

28:16.862 --> 28:18.762
So the company
and their lobbyists

28:18.764 --> 28:20.164
Just took matters
into their own hands.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.066
And with gostin dead,
and a more agreeable party

28:22.068 --> 28:24.068
Taking over
after a special election,

28:24.070 --> 28:26.804
That water redistribution bill
will not pass.

28:26.806 --> 28:27.805
Sundorna and

28:27.807 --> 28:29.039
Barnwright make billions.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.908
We've got our smoking gun.

28:30.910 --> 28:33.177
We've I.D.'d the killers, we've
got the evidence to back 'em up.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.179
We're going to the fbi.

28:35.181 --> 28:36.914
Rebecca:
Cabe!

28:39.017 --> 28:40.818
(muffled scream)

28:44.923 --> 28:47.024
No. No!

28:47.026 --> 28:49.860
Yeah, they slashed
all eight tires.

28:49.862 --> 28:51.295
Rebecca.

28:51.297 --> 28:52.463
Catching up's gonna
be a challenge.

28:52.465 --> 28:54.131
Maybe not.

28:54.133 --> 28:56.200
Happy, come with me.

28:56.202 --> 28:59.970
You got three minutes
to get her running!

28:59.972 --> 29:02.039
All I need is a wrench.
Okay.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.807
You three, go inside.

29:03.809 --> 29:04.808
Track the vehicle.

29:04.810 --> 29:05.909
Red sedan, four-door.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.311
There's a strip of rust
on the trunk,

29:07.313 --> 29:10.881
We'll access the caltrans
cameras and find the car.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.316
Cabe: How the hell
did they find us?

29:12.318 --> 29:13.884
We were so careful.
We were.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.853
Who knows what kind
of access they have?

29:17.021 --> 29:18.856
Hey. Cabe.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.390
Look at me.

29:21.993 --> 29:23.327
We will find her.

29:30.468 --> 29:33.337
(engine revving, horns honking)

29:33.339 --> 29:34.371
Guys, what do you got?

29:34.373 --> 29:35.372
Happy:
Picture's up, walt!

29:35.374 --> 29:36.507
We've got a visual

29:36.509 --> 29:38.208
On a ten-mile radius
around this house.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.144
Toby: We're scanning for
that red car now.

29:40.146 --> 29:42.212
Cabe: We're about a mile
from half a dozen

29:42.214 --> 29:43.814
Freeway exchanges;
they could either be going

29:43.816 --> 29:45.082
To the coast or the desert.

29:45.084 --> 29:46.250
You got 45 seconds

29:46.252 --> 29:47.951
To tell us if we're
heading north or south.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.153
It's a whole mess
of cars out there.

29:49.155 --> 29:53.323
Try this: Lay a color filter
over the video feeds.

29:53.325 --> 29:54.458
Good idea.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.893
Then we can highlight
the red cars,

29:55.895 --> 29:57.494
Make the kidnappers' car
easier to spot.

29:59.932 --> 30:03.367
Red station wagon.
Red v6 pickup.

30:03.369 --> 30:05.402
Oh, come on, rusty
four-door, where are you?

30:05.404 --> 30:07.437
Ooh, we got a live one!

30:07.439 --> 30:08.305
Ah!

30:08.307 --> 30:09.907
Red car,

30:09.909 --> 30:11.408
Rust patch on the trunk!
That's the one!

30:11.410 --> 30:12.376
They're headed south

30:12.378 --> 30:14.278
On the I-5. South!
Hang on.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.947
(horns honking)

30:16.949 --> 30:18.315
They're passing
the sylmar exit.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.818
That's about five and a half
miles from here.

30:20.820 --> 30:21.985
They're going faster
than I anticipated.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.453
But just over the speed limit.

30:23.455 --> 30:28.258
They'll kill her and bury her
where no one can find the body.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.294
Cabe, that's not gonna happen.

30:36.201 --> 30:38.001
(car horns honking)

30:42.841 --> 30:44.608
(muffled scream)

30:53.518 --> 30:54.484
We got 'em.

30:54.486 --> 30:55.986
Think they see us?

30:56.421 --> 30:59.056
Whoa!

30:59.058 --> 31:00.157
Yes.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.526
(tires screeching)

31:07.932 --> 31:09.466
Cabe, they're turning off.

31:11.102 --> 31:12.236
Cabe:
Hold tight, walter!

31:25.450 --> 31:27.417
(steam hissing)

31:31.990 --> 31:33.490
Cabe?

31:33.492 --> 31:35.492
Cabe? Cabe?

31:35.494 --> 31:37.995
Cabe, wake up. Cabe!

31:37.997 --> 31:39.496
Cabe!

31:41.332 --> 31:43.033
Toby:
Walter, are you guys okay?

31:43.035 --> 31:45.035
Yeah. We're alive.

31:45.037 --> 31:47.537
You still have eyes
on that car?

31:47.539 --> 31:49.907
Happy: We lost visual
when they turned off

31:49.909 --> 31:52.910
On araiza boulevard, eastbound.

31:52.912 --> 31:54.945
Go get us a car.

32:02.553 --> 32:04.421
(horns honking)

32:06.524 --> 32:08.025
What the hell?!

32:08.027 --> 32:09.927
Homeland security!
(groans)

32:09.929 --> 32:11.161
Sorry, it's a national
emergency.

32:11.163 --> 32:12.596
Need to commandeer
your vehicle.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.698
Come on. Sorry.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.234
Let's go. Let's go.

32:17.236 --> 32:18.502
(tires screeching)

32:22.507 --> 32:24.107
Guys, can you slow them down?

32:24.109 --> 32:25.409
Sylvester:
Already done. Happy dropped

32:25.411 --> 32:27.044
A railroad crossing arm
up ahead.

32:27.046 --> 32:28.545
Traffic snarled
to a dead stop.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.047
They'll want
to keep on moving,

32:30.049 --> 32:32.649
And the only other option
is the service road.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.551
But it's green all day,
so guaranteed

32:34.553 --> 32:36.453
They're burning rubber.
Drive fast!

32:39.624 --> 32:42.592
(horns blaring)

32:42.594 --> 32:44.594
There they are.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.741
Got to do something
to make them stop.

32:57.743 --> 32:59.743
Rebecca in the car,
I can't risk taking a shot.

32:59.745 --> 33:02.112
I'm thinking pit maneuver.
You're thinking right.

33:02.114 --> 33:04.014
Sylvester: Walter, do you know
how to do a pit maneuver?

33:04.016 --> 33:05.482
Pit: Precision
immobilization technique.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.684
It's how the highway patrol
stops a fleeing car.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.219
I've read about them
extensively.

33:09.221 --> 33:10.387
Oh, my god!

33:10.389 --> 33:12.255
You got this?
With a little help.

33:12.257 --> 33:13.590
Happy, based on
the make and model,

33:13.592 --> 33:15.058
How do I make their tires
lose their bead?

33:15.060 --> 33:17.995
Just strike the bumper
at a 32-degree angle.

33:17.997 --> 33:19.262
Ideal impact point?

33:19.264 --> 33:20.430
15 inches from the back bumper,

33:20.432 --> 33:22.366
While traveling
at approximately...

33:22.368 --> 33:23.400
Sylvester:
Oh, god.

33:23.402 --> 33:24.334
68 miles an hour!

33:24.336 --> 33:26.103
You ready?
Yeah.

33:26.105 --> 33:27.204
You can do this.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.072
Here we go.

33:29.074 --> 33:31.141
(engine revving)

33:34.379 --> 33:35.612
(tires screeching)

33:50.328 --> 33:53.463
(gunfire)

33:53.465 --> 33:55.365
Let me see your hands!

33:55.367 --> 33:56.533
Get rid of that weapon!

33:56.535 --> 33:58.135
Out of the car!
Get over here!

33:58.137 --> 33:59.369
On your knees!

33:59.371 --> 34:01.671
(sirens approaching)

34:01.673 --> 34:02.773
Hey.

34:04.075 --> 34:06.143
Cabe.

34:19.758 --> 34:23.527
I'm a lawyer. I know my way
around a deposition.

34:23.529 --> 34:25.262
What about the men
who took me?

34:25.264 --> 34:29.232
Singing like the beach boys,
trying to cut a deal.

34:29.234 --> 34:32.436
I can't wait to watch
that whole company go down.

34:32.438 --> 34:33.470
Where's walter?

34:33.472 --> 34:35.205
Cleaning up.

34:35.207 --> 34:37.407
He's a good young man.

34:37.409 --> 34:38.475
The best.

34:38.477 --> 34:40.343
You were tough on him today.

34:40.345 --> 34:41.545
Yeah, well.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.146
You were tough on all of them.

34:43.148 --> 34:44.714
Yeah, well.

34:46.684 --> 34:49.386
I'm sorry for
how I spoke to you earlier.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.221
You have every right

34:51.223 --> 34:54.424
To live, to grieve,
however you like.

34:54.426 --> 34:57.527
I abandoned you after she died.

34:57.529 --> 35:00.263
All those assignments overseas
that I said were mandatory,

35:00.265 --> 35:01.565
I lied.

35:03.501 --> 35:07.304
It's an ugly thing
that I live with.

35:07.306 --> 35:08.505
Today I couldn't
bear the thought

35:08.507 --> 35:10.107
Of letting you down again.

35:10.109 --> 35:12.742
Becca,

35:12.744 --> 35:16.580
I know you've moved on,

35:16.582 --> 35:20.550
But I have to ask you...

35:20.552 --> 35:22.752
Do you ever think about us?

35:24.722 --> 35:27.624
You're the love of my life.

35:29.760 --> 35:33.497
I've thought about you
for 15 years.

35:33.499 --> 35:36.633
Tried to write you
a hundred letters.

35:39.570 --> 35:42.539
But I think everything
happens for a reason.

35:42.541 --> 35:45.175
I have to,

35:45.177 --> 35:47.511
Or I can't make sense
of what happened to amanda.

35:47.513 --> 35:51.348
Besides, I have
a family now.

35:57.622 --> 35:59.689
So do you.

36:01.492 --> 36:03.760
Sell the house.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.562
Maybe someday.

36:08.466 --> 36:10.800
You were always really badass.

36:18.609 --> 36:21.511
(whispers):
Take care of him for me.

36:21.513 --> 36:24.214
Okay.

36:32.423 --> 36:34.391
You did right by her.

36:34.393 --> 36:35.559
She's safe.

36:35.561 --> 36:39.729
I always put my
job before her.

36:41.666 --> 36:43.667
The real shame of it is:

36:43.669 --> 36:47.671
The only thing I was ever really
better at than being a fed

36:47.673 --> 36:49.239
Was being a father.

36:49.241 --> 36:52.776
For what it's worth,

36:52.778 --> 36:56.780
When I was young,
you were like a father to me.

36:58.649 --> 37:02.252
Sometimes you still are.

37:02.254 --> 37:04.254
Toby:
Cabe!

37:04.256 --> 37:06.556
Happy: It is a good thing
those jerks didn't

37:06.558 --> 37:09.826
Steal my blowtorch, or
they'd have a real problem.

37:09.828 --> 37:12.796
Hey, cabe,
I'm completing an inventory

37:12.798 --> 37:14.397
Of all purloined equipment;

37:14.399 --> 37:17.334
And I expect the government
to compensate us in full.

37:17.336 --> 37:18.635
Homeland will
foot the cost.

37:18.637 --> 37:21.705
Okay, I'm gonna pad
this bill a little.

37:26.477 --> 37:28.812
Ralph. Hey.

37:32.383 --> 37:34.651
(chuckles)

37:34.653 --> 37:36.419
Thank you, pal.

37:36.421 --> 37:38.922
They really messed
up the garage.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.690
Yeah, they sure did.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.525
You know, I'm gonna
have to rebuild this game.

37:42.527 --> 37:43.593
Do you want to help me?

37:43.595 --> 37:45.762
Yeah.
Okay.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.864
Sit down.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.666
Here, hold that.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.568
Drew:
Another time, ralph.

37:51.570 --> 37:54.971
Your mom says time
to start packing up.

37:58.743 --> 38:00.744
How's it going?

38:00.746 --> 38:02.545
What happened in here?

38:02.547 --> 38:04.814
It was a high-stress day.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.549
But that's behind us now.

38:06.551 --> 38:07.550
Got it.

38:07.552 --> 38:08.652
Then I'm not gonna bother you

38:08.654 --> 38:09.953
About that thing
we talked about before.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.721
I don't have an answer for you.

38:11.723 --> 38:13.456
No, it's okay.
Yeah, I mean...

38:13.458 --> 38:14.824
Ralph is my priority.

38:14.826 --> 38:17.427
I'm just trying
to do right by the kid.

38:17.429 --> 38:18.561
You and me both.

38:18.563 --> 38:19.996
All right.

38:25.803 --> 38:27.771
We, um... Are gonna
get some food.

38:27.773 --> 38:28.938
Do you want to join us?

38:28.940 --> 38:31.741
Oh, um...

38:31.743 --> 38:33.677
I'm-I'm not hungry, thanks.

38:33.679 --> 38:34.678
Okay.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.713
Bye.
Bye.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.782
Bye, ralph.
Bye.

38:43.954 --> 38:45.955
(door closes)

38:45.957 --> 38:48.692
I don't know about you,
but I could go for a burger.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.760
Oh, I'm starving.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.568
Sorry about your le mans.

38:58.570 --> 39:01.805
Happy said
she'd fix it.

39:01.807 --> 39:05.775
So what if there was
a scenario where, um...

39:05.777 --> 39:07.744
Drew takes ralph?

39:07.746 --> 39:09.012
Takes him where?

39:09.014 --> 39:10.413
Just a hypothetical.

39:10.415 --> 39:12.649
To another city.

39:12.651 --> 39:15.752
I wouldn't jump off
the bridge just yet.

39:15.754 --> 39:18.388
There was a time when I wasn't
sure if I'd see you again.

39:18.390 --> 39:21.758
Different circumstances,
of course, but... I had faith

39:21.760 --> 39:24.127
That we'd meet
another day.

39:26.097 --> 39:29.132
Appreciate what you said earlier
about me being a father to you,

39:29.134 --> 39:31.735
Even if it was said
in the heat of the battle.

39:33.704 --> 39:36.840
Well, you know me.

39:36.842 --> 39:40.710
When have I ever said
anything I didn't mean?

39:40.712 --> 39:42.612
