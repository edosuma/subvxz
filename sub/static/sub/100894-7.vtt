[Tyler] Is it time for my break yet?

01:21.498 --> 01:23.291
[Maddie]
You've been here less than an hour.

01:23.792 --> 01:26.878
[groans]
This is some really exciting work.

01:26.961 --> 01:29.756
Well, that is what happens at a job.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.926
And I told you, we just need your help
until we can find some bodies.

01:33.009 --> 01:36.513
And cue the anthem of the downtrodden
working men and women,

01:36.596 --> 01:38.014
by which I mean <i>9 to 5.</i>

01:38.098 --> 01:40.934
Mm-hmm. That reference is before his time.

01:41.017 --> 01:43.645
And besides,
Bill was very anti-Dolly Parton.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.730
What? When did you find this out?

01:45.814 --> 01:48.024
And why did you not leave him
right then and there? I mean,

01:48.108 --> 01:51.069
it's Dolly. She <i>is </i>country music.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.779
She has triumphed over adversity.

01:52.862 --> 01:55.657
She is... [sighs] ...joy.

01:55.740 --> 01:56.741
[Maddie] Yeah.

01:56.825 --> 02:00.995
Hey, Ty, why don't you take these towels
of many colors to the cleaners?

02:01.079 --> 02:02.747
And Dolly would tell you
to ask for a raise.

02:02.831 --> 02:03.957
Turncoat.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.125
It's true, though.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.085
If I'm gonna be running
all these errands, I...

02:07.836 --> 02:08.795
might need a car.

02:08.878 --> 02:09.921
To drive four blocks?

02:10.004 --> 02:11.548
-[door opens]
-Cal!

02:12.090 --> 02:14.509
Dolly Parton, for or against?

02:16.219 --> 02:17.220
For?

02:17.303 --> 02:18.513
You don't sound sure.

02:18.596 --> 02:20.598
Why are you not sure?
What makes you so uncertain

02:20.682 --> 02:22.225
about where you stand
on the greatest singer of all time?

02:22.308 --> 02:23.726
-I'm sure.
-Are you just saying that

02:23.810 --> 02:26.062
because you're my best friend,
and you know how passionate I am

02:26.146 --> 02:27.147
about country music,

02:27.230 --> 02:29.399
and you know I've been trying
to increase your music literacy?

02:29.482 --> 02:31.442
My mom had a dog named Jolene.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.113
-Oh, yeah!
-Ah!

02:35.196 --> 02:37.365
Ah, not to get you in trouble
with the boss,

02:37.448 --> 02:39.909
but, uh, take it easy on that arm, Ty.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.245
Now that the college scouts
have handed in their reports,

02:42.328 --> 02:44.664
it might not be a bad idea
for you to sit out a few.

02:46.541 --> 02:49.961
Okay, well, not against Castlewood, right?
It's the biggest game of the season.

02:50.378 --> 02:51.462
We'll talk.

02:52.172 --> 02:56.092
Here, let me give you a hand with that
out of respect for the golden arm.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.553
-See ya.
-Thanks.

02:59.095 --> 03:00.054
[clears throat]

03:01.806 --> 03:02.640
So...

03:02.724 --> 03:05.852
-Hmm. So.
-You here to check on Ty or me?

03:05.935 --> 03:08.188
I thought I would surprise you
and take you to dinner.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.814
[sighs] I wish I could.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.609
So much going on around here,
I can't get away.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.444
Even for you.

03:14.527 --> 03:15.945
Well, how about Saturday night?

03:16.738 --> 03:19.741
Dinner, my place, I'll cook?

03:19.824 --> 03:20.825
You can do that?

03:20.909 --> 03:22.035
[chuckles] Hmm.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.916
Come and see. Seven o'clock.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.167
Okay.

03:41.262 --> 03:42.138
I get it.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.806
It's pretty out here,

03:44.307 --> 03:46.184
but you know where else is pretty?

03:46.851 --> 03:49.479
-My bed, which I should still be in.
-[Erik chuckles]

03:50.730 --> 03:52.649
[Erik] It's good to get out in nature.

03:53.441 --> 03:56.110
Quiet your mind, your soul.

03:58.154 --> 03:59.447
I lost track of that.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.407
But I'm back on it.

04:03.701 --> 04:06.079
My father used to take me
and my brother hiking.

04:06.996 --> 04:09.165
How to spot the local birds along the way.

04:09.832 --> 04:13.503
Uh, my dad's idea of bonding
was balancing the checkbook together.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.755
He was an accounting professor.

04:16.381 --> 04:18.007
I thought you didn't know
who your dad was.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.677
Oh, my birth father, or my birth mother.

04:21.135 --> 04:21.970
I was adopted.

04:22.053 --> 04:25.515
All I know is my birth mom left a note
saying she was from Serenity.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.600
You think he was, too?

04:27.684 --> 04:28.935
He seemed like he could be.

04:29.018 --> 04:31.604
So, I thought I'd move here
and see if I could find him.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.899
And because I couldn't fill in
all the blanks in your life...

04:35.733 --> 04:36.859
I thought that...

04:37.443 --> 04:38.278
I hoped...

04:40.029 --> 04:40.863
I'm sorry.

04:41.489 --> 04:42.991
Oh, no, no. I understand.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.286
But you need to be careful
with your poking.

04:46.744 --> 04:47.578
I will be.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.581
Are you and your adoptive family close?

04:51.082 --> 04:53.251
Yeah, I mean, we were. We had to be.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.671
A mixed-race family in Columbus
20 years ago.

04:56.754 --> 04:59.424
It felt like it was the three of us
against the world.

04:59.507 --> 05:00.717
But you're not anymore?

05:00.800 --> 05:02.927
Uh, my mom passed a year ago.

05:05.221 --> 05:06.055
I'm sorry.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.348
And after that,

05:08.474 --> 05:10.101
[sighs] things got hard with Dad.

05:11.769 --> 05:13.604
Seemed like he didn't want me around,
so...

05:14.939 --> 05:15.940
here I am.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.317
Making mistakes. [chuckles]

05:17.400 --> 05:19.193
No. You're making friends.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.904
Opening up. Learning.

05:26.617 --> 05:27.535
Ready for more?

05:31.456 --> 05:32.540
[chuckles]

05:37.712 --> 05:38.713
[Kyle] <i>And when I was there,</i>

05:39.630 --> 05:41.799
all I could think about
was my baby brother.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.553
I swear. I didn't do it.

05:47.221 --> 05:48.389
No more questions, Your Honor.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.892
Nice job, both of you.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.977
[chuckling] You can sit down.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.647
All right, next time we're gonna do
opening and closing statements.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.859
Now, remember,
remember when you're making an argument,

05:59.942 --> 06:03.821
you want to state a thesis
and then cite evidence to support it.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.156
Now, after you're done,

06:05.239 --> 06:07.450
you wanna make
an emotional appeal for ethos

06:07.533 --> 06:11.496
to drive home whatever it is
that you're trying to get across. Okay?

06:11.579 --> 06:12.580
[bell ringing]

06:12.663 --> 06:15.666
And, gang,
Ms. Decatur starts the trial tomorrow,

06:15.750 --> 06:18.044
so from now on, practice is at 7:30 sharp.

06:19.921 --> 06:22.507
Seven thirty? Who's bringing me coffee?

06:22.590 --> 06:25.551
Leaving the house before sunrise
is against my religion.

06:25.635 --> 06:26.844
I can't do 7:30.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.971
Well, I'm sure the good Lord
will make an exception.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.265
Nope. Y'all have to go on without me.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.194
I still don't understand
why the baseball team

06:43.277 --> 06:45.905
didn't award Dana Sue
the MVP award our senior year.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.031
I mean, if not for her,

06:47.115 --> 06:48.908
Castlewood would've won that game.

06:48.991 --> 06:51.202
My break-up with Tommy Nickels
had nothin' to do with that game.

06:51.285 --> 06:53.830
You shouldn't have been dating
a Castlewood boy, you wild thing.

06:53.913 --> 06:54.914
-[Helen] Truth.
-I broke up with him

06:54.997 --> 06:56.874
because he was an ill-mannered lunk.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.626
-Mm-hmm.
-And maybe...

06:59.293 --> 07:01.337
I waited until right before
the big game to tell him

07:01.421 --> 07:04.173
because I knew
that it would destroy his confidence,

07:04.507 --> 07:06.217
-and wreck his game...
-Yes.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.760
...because I am a Bulldog...

07:07.844 --> 07:09.429
[barking]

07:09.512 --> 07:11.389
...through and through.

07:11.472 --> 07:12.557
[all laugh]

07:12.640 --> 07:15.601
Oh, oh, but speaking of great victories...

07:18.062 --> 07:20.481
Okay, you two scare me when you do that.
What are you up to?

07:20.940 --> 07:23.776
Each and every time we gather together...

07:23.860 --> 07:26.237
-Yes.
-...it is a cause for celebration.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.780
-I agree.
-[Dana Sue] However...

07:27.864 --> 07:29.157
-Oh, no.
-[Dana Sue] Listen!

07:29.240 --> 07:31.367
Oh, yes! And tonight,

07:31.451 --> 07:33.661
I have something very, very special.

07:33.744 --> 07:36.664
-Okay.
-I have something that, might I say,

07:36.747 --> 07:38.332
is extraordinary.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.459
[Maddie laughs]

07:39.834 --> 07:40.960
What is this?

07:49.177 --> 07:50.428
My divorce papers.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.142
Tom dropped them off today.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.561
And I thought that tonight
would be a lovely opportunity

07:58.644 --> 07:59.520
for you to sign.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.733
Well, Bill finally signed.

08:04.609 --> 08:05.485
Bless his heart.

08:05.985 --> 08:09.989
Bless <i>you </i>that his heart
and everything else is still intact.

08:10.072 --> 08:10.907
Hmm.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.119
All you have to do is sign those

08:15.203 --> 08:18.247
and your marriage to Bill Townsend
is officially over.

08:20.666 --> 08:21.751
Doesn't seem real.

08:22.376 --> 08:24.170
Just one signature, and it's all over.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.885
-Who has a pen?
-[Helen] Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.638
-That scared the crap out of me.
-[Helen] She did.

08:34.388 --> 08:35.515
[laughs]

08:36.390 --> 08:38.100
[Dana Sue] Sign it like you mean it.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.268
[Helen] Mmm.

08:41.312 --> 08:42.772
-To new beginnings.
-Mmm.

08:42.855 --> 08:43.981
To new beginnings.

08:48.819 --> 08:52.990
[Noreen] Should we focus on a house
where the nursery is closer to our room?

08:53.074 --> 08:54.825
Or is down the hall okay?

08:54.909 --> 08:58.579
I mean, I want Peanut to have
his or her own space,

08:58.663 --> 09:00.831
but we should be close
if something happens.

09:01.666 --> 09:02.667
Sounds good.

09:05.002 --> 09:05.920
Which one?

09:06.546 --> 09:07.880
-Hmm?
-Bill.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.799
Are you even listening to me?

09:10.925 --> 09:11.884
[sighs]

09:12.635 --> 09:13.803
Yeah. [clears throat]

09:13.886 --> 09:14.762
I'm sorry.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.639
Did you have a bad day, honey?

09:17.640 --> 09:18.474
No.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.559
[chuckles]

09:20.434 --> 09:22.937
No, not bad exactly.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.816
-Noreen, today I went down to, um...
-[knocking at door]

09:28.401 --> 09:29.610
You expecting somebody?

09:30.027 --> 09:30.861
No.

09:31.862 --> 09:32.947
[Bill sighs]

09:38.619 --> 09:39.579
[Bill] Hello.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.498
-[Noreen] Garth!
-[laughs] How are you, Neen?

09:43.791 --> 09:46.085
What are you doing here?

09:46.168 --> 09:47.670
Can't I come visit my big sis?

09:47.753 --> 09:50.464
Oh, of course, I'm just hormonal.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.674
[both laugh]

09:52.842 --> 09:54.885
Mom and Daddy wanted you to have this.

09:54.969 --> 09:55.803
Oh.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.638
And I wanted to be the one
to bring it to you.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.390
Aww.

09:59.473 --> 10:00.474
[Garth grunts]

10:01.183 --> 10:02.101
What is that?

10:02.184 --> 10:04.478
Oh, Bill,
this is my little brother, Garth.

10:04.562 --> 10:05.563
Garth, this is Bill.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.356
Sorry we haven't had the pleasure
till now, Doc.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.109
Yeah. Hey there, Garth.

10:10.192 --> 10:12.194
This is our family cradle.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.405
Our names are burned in when we're born.

10:14.739 --> 10:15.990
Look how far this goes back.

10:16.073 --> 10:17.366
Here's mine.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.619
There's Garth's,
and this is our older brother, Aaron's.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.163
Kind of like the family Bible. [laughs]

10:22.246 --> 10:24.165
-Here, Bill.
-[Bill] All right.

10:24.874 --> 10:28.085
Come on in.
So how long are you here to stay?

10:28.169 --> 10:29.128
[Garth] Not long.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.882
[blender whirring]

10:35.551 --> 10:37.762
Annie! You're gonna be late!

10:37.845 --> 10:39.597
[phone chiming]

10:45.519 --> 10:46.896
What are you doing with my phone?

10:46.979 --> 10:48.939
What-- What do those emojis mean?

10:49.357 --> 10:50.650
Did you go to a party?

10:51.275 --> 10:53.861
Some baseball players hung out
after the fundraiser.

10:54.278 --> 10:55.154
It's no biggie.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.907
I got to go, or I'll be late. Love you.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.784
Love you. Have a good day.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.411
[door opens, closes]

11:07.458 --> 11:08.918
[man] You got other responsibilities.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.336
Yes, sir. I know, I just thought--

11:10.419 --> 11:12.922
You hear me, Caroline?
I ain't gonna say it again.

11:14.256 --> 11:15.257
I--

11:15.341 --> 11:16.384
Good morning, CeCe.

11:17.885 --> 11:18.719
Ms. Decatur.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.180
Uh, you were truly missed this morning.

11:21.263 --> 11:22.431
Where were you supposed to be
this morning?

11:22.515 --> 11:23.474
Nowhere, Daddy.

11:23.557 --> 11:27.687
-Oh, Mr. Matney. I'm--
-I'm Mr. nothin'. It's Russ.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.983
R-- Russ, I'm Helen Decatur.
I'm a lawyer, and--

11:33.067 --> 11:34.485
-Lawyer? What kind of trouble is she in?
-No.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.570
No, no, no, no, no.
No trouble. No trouble.

11:37.446 --> 11:42.034
I'm, uh... I'm helping CeCe with a project
that meets before school.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.120
Caroline ain't got time before school.

11:44.578 --> 11:46.372
She's got her brother and sister
to get ready.

11:47.456 --> 11:50.459
I, uh, gathered that you didn't know

11:50.543 --> 11:53.838
that CeCe is participating
in the school's Mock Trial program.

11:54.296 --> 11:56.382
And-- And that could be my fault.
[chuckles]

11:56.465 --> 11:57.299
I'm new.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.136
And, uh,
I should've talked to our parents.

12:00.720 --> 12:04.807
But your daughter is extremely bright,
and I--

12:04.890 --> 12:07.268
Caroline. Go to class.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.816
-Russ, I--
-Been working all night. I'm goin' home.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.165
[knocks on door]

12:29.790 --> 12:32.251
Mary Vaughn. Hey there.

12:32.334 --> 12:33.252
[sighs] Hey.

12:33.335 --> 12:37.214
So, listen, I had Skeeter run by
that colonial on Dogwood,

12:37.298 --> 12:39.842
it needs a little work,
but no big problems.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.886
Well, one.

12:42.928 --> 12:43.763
The bank.

12:43.846 --> 12:44.805
How do you mean?

12:45.306 --> 12:47.933
Hazel had to rerun everything
because it's been a few months

12:48.017 --> 12:50.436
since you filed
your first mortgage application.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.814
Uh, you weren't approved this time.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.151
Well, that makes no sense.

12:57.234 --> 12:58.235
What's different?

12:59.153 --> 13:01.447
-Well, you didn't sell Maddie's house.
-Right.

13:01.530 --> 13:02.865
That and...

13:03.783 --> 13:06.202
the final child support
changed all the numbers.

13:10.998 --> 13:12.666
I knew that was gonna be tight.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.960
All right, well... [sighs]

13:16.545 --> 13:17.713
Listen, um...

13:18.631 --> 13:22.760
you didn't... tell Noreen
about any of this yet, have you?

13:22.843 --> 13:24.512
Oh. No, that is not my place.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.222
I appreciate that.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.182
But now, don't you worry.

13:28.265 --> 13:29.809
Hazel worked up some new numbers,

13:29.892 --> 13:33.979
and I have found some options that you
and Noreen will be just as happy with.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.481
We're gonna make this work.

13:42.404 --> 13:45.324
Did Ty tell you anything
about a party after the fundraiser?

13:45.407 --> 13:46.867
No. Why? What'd you hear?

13:47.993 --> 13:49.495
I don't-- I don't know. I--

13:49.954 --> 13:53.249
When I asked Annie about it,
she just ran off to school.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.752
Oh, she didn't tell me
because there was alcohol there.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.172
No, no, no. No, Annie is way too smart
to be drinking at a party.

14:01.215 --> 14:05.010
Yeah, I thought so too, but that text--

14:05.094 --> 14:06.220
Said she was drinking?

14:06.303 --> 14:10.558
Ugh, how do I even know? I mean,
it was just a bunch of damn emojis.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.852
Why can't our kids use words
instead of symbols?

14:12.935 --> 14:16.188
Like they're Neanderthals
just painting on a cave wall.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.774
Ty, come in here, please.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.277
-Hey.
-Morning.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.278
The truth.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.614
How much alcohol was at that party
after the fundraiser?

14:26.740 --> 14:28.742
Um... Look, Annie was okay.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.661
As soon as Jackson
got all heavy-breather on her,

14:30.744 --> 14:33.289
-I got her out of there, and it was chill.
-Jackson did what?

14:33.372 --> 14:36.417
Nothing. Nothing.
He, uh... He did nothing.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.753
Annie was drinking,
and Jackson did something to her?

14:39.837 --> 14:42.381
He didn't.
Gabe and I kept an eye on her all night.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.718
So she was drunk enough
that you had to keep an eye on her?

14:45.801 --> 14:47.720
No, I didn't mean that. Um...

14:47.803 --> 14:49.555
Come on, we're gonna be late.

14:50.848 --> 14:51.765
Can't be late.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.023
What the heck?

15:03.235 --> 15:05.863
[Tyler] You should've come in earlier
with Annie and missed all that.

15:05.946 --> 15:06.989
Are you kidding me?

15:07.072 --> 15:09.074
First of all,
she had mock trial, and we didn't.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.951
Second, you're lucky I'm walking with you.

15:12.036 --> 15:12.870
What?

15:13.579 --> 15:14.705
I don't know what's worse.

15:14.788 --> 15:16.415
The fact that Jackson slobbered
all over Annie,

15:16.498 --> 15:18.584
or that you stuck your tongue
down her throat after he did.

15:18.667 --> 15:19.501
I didn't kiss Annie!

15:19.585 --> 15:21.295
-I heard the message, Ty.
-She kissed me!

15:31.138 --> 15:32.056
[sighs]

15:32.681 --> 15:33.766
[knock on door]

15:35.392 --> 15:37.144
-Mrs. Lewis.
-Hey there.

15:38.103 --> 15:41.815
I was just congratulating Coach Bixby
on his sweet new baby girl.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.068
And now I wanna congratulate you both

15:44.151 --> 15:47.404
on what a fine season
we are having thus far.

15:47.488 --> 15:50.991
It has been a while
since we locked up Regionals this early.

15:51.450 --> 15:52.785
-The boys have worked hard.
-[Mary] Mm-hmm.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.287
Yeah, I explained to Mrs. Lewis
that every single player

15:55.371 --> 15:58.165
has been given the opportunity
to play at his highest level

15:58.248 --> 16:00.709
-all season long.
-But the season's not over.

16:01.251 --> 16:03.587
-Hmm.
-No, ma'am. It is not.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.798
[Mary] And you're not from around here,

16:05.881 --> 16:08.467
so I'm not sure you appreciate
just how important

16:08.550 --> 16:11.011
tomorrow's game against Castlewood
really is.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.765
I teach all my players
to treat every game the same.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.893
Lovely advice... for them.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.478
But, Coach, in many ways,

16:19.561 --> 16:22.147
this is the biggest game of the season,

16:22.231 --> 16:23.899
and it has been ever since Harlan here

16:23.983 --> 16:28.821
single-handedly defeated them
his senior year with a grand slam.

16:28.904 --> 16:32.449
It was the kind of underdog upset
that somebody ought to make a movie about.

16:32.533 --> 16:35.869
One RBI sac fly
that turned into a in the house grand slam

16:35.953 --> 16:36.996
because somebody tripped.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.706
Whoo! [laughs]

16:39.540 --> 16:42.001
Now, because of the importance
of this game,

16:42.793 --> 16:43.961
Jackson should start.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.881
He understands the stakes
better than anybody.

16:47.965 --> 16:51.760
Especially since his cousin Clint
is Castlewood's star player.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.515
Now, have you seen Clint's stats
this season?

16:58.934 --> 17:00.728
No, I can't say that I have.

17:00.811 --> 17:01.979
Mm-mm-mm.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.898
Every time I talk to my sister,

17:04.982 --> 17:09.486
she won't stop going on and on
about all of his RBIs and homers.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.613
You need to get into that boy's head,

17:11.697 --> 17:13.699
and neutralize him from the get-go.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.075
[chuckles]

17:15.159 --> 17:17.036
Jackson's the only player who can do that.

17:18.370 --> 17:21.498
Well, I appreciate your input, Mrs. Lewis.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.792
Thank you for stopping by.

17:26.378 --> 17:29.089
Jackson is every bit as good

17:29.173 --> 17:31.633
if not better than Tyler Townsend.

17:32.092 --> 17:34.219
And if you weren't dancing in the sheets
with his mama,

17:35.637 --> 17:36.680
you'd see that.

17:40.768 --> 17:43.187
I want to win tomorrow's game
as much as anybody.

17:43.812 --> 17:46.231
And that's the only reason
Ty is going to start.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.067
Hmm.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.652
Let's just see about that.

17:55.574 --> 17:58.786
That's bizarre.
How have you never heard of <i>Clone Wars?</i>

17:58.869 --> 18:01.789
-I don't know. [chuckles]
<i>-Star Wars,</i> animated. Pew, pew, pew.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.749
-You are such a boy.
-[chuckles]

18:05.959 --> 18:06.960
Hey!

18:07.461 --> 18:09.922
Annie. Look, I need to tell you,
your mom came over, and...

18:15.010 --> 18:16.136
[both chuckle]

18:27.314 --> 18:28.148
How's it going?

18:29.566 --> 18:31.693
As good as it can be
with Mary Vaughn here.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.154
Yeah.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.739
I saw Helen last night.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.449
[door opens]

18:37.533 --> 18:39.451
-Sorry that we're here, folks.
-I'll tell you later.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.538
My office isn't big enough
for this gathering.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.331
So why don't we sit down?

18:53.090 --> 18:53.966
[sighs]

18:54.049 --> 18:55.592
Uh, Coach Maddox.

18:55.676 --> 18:59.054
It has been brought to my attention
that the Boosters...

18:59.138 --> 18:59.972
Boosters?

19:00.055 --> 19:03.183
...are worried that
you're demonstrating favoritism

19:03.267 --> 19:05.519
in selecting your starting lineup

19:05.602 --> 19:08.480
because of your, uh, personal relationship

19:08.564 --> 19:10.149
with some parents.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.485
All right. All right,
we're not gonna horse around here, okay?

19:13.569 --> 19:16.029
You two just admit that you're pissed off

19:16.113 --> 19:18.407
because Tyler is more talented
than Jackson.

19:19.199 --> 19:20.284
Well, how would anybody know

19:20.367 --> 19:22.744
since Coach Maddox keeps Jackson
on the bench?

19:22.828 --> 19:25.831
It appears that Coach Maddox
has a vested interest

19:25.914 --> 19:27.916
in keeping the Townsends happy.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.003
My coaching decisions
have nothing to do with my personal life.

19:31.086 --> 19:33.630
-Maybe we can bring--
-You give Ty extra attention!

19:33.714 --> 19:35.632
-He's our starter.
-And ignore other boys

19:35.716 --> 19:37.009
who are asking for your help.

19:37.092 --> 19:39.428
No, ma'am.
No matter what your son tells you.

19:39.511 --> 19:42.472
How can you expect any of us
to believe that you're unbiased

19:42.556 --> 19:45.976
given the indecent way you and Maddie
have been carrying on in public?

19:46.059 --> 19:47.102
What's she talking about?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.688
Okay, now you're just trying
to spread gossip, Mary Vaughn.

19:49.771 --> 19:52.232
No, I am trying to make sure
Serenity wins,

19:52.316 --> 19:54.109
and to make sure
that my son doesn't suffer

19:54.193 --> 19:55.903
because of your boyfriend's hormones.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.738
Hey, are you gonna control your wife here?

19:57.821 --> 19:58.822
[scoffs] At least I have one.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.824
The only person
you're trying to help is yourself.

20:00.908 --> 20:01.783
[Cal] Hold on.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.328
If the Lewises, or, excuse me,

20:04.411 --> 20:07.873
the Boosters think
that I can't be objective,

20:08.624 --> 20:10.500
I'll just take myself out of the equation.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.419
But you can't skip the game.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.630
No, but if the concern is
that I'm partial,

20:15.714 --> 20:17.299
Harlan can pick the starting lineup.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.134
I'll coach whoever he puts on the team.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.638
Well, that's a fine idea.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.848
Um, Harlan, is that acceptable to you?

20:25.724 --> 20:26.558
Yes, ma'am.

20:28.143 --> 20:29.144
Ty's starting.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.898
Excellent. Thank you all for your time.
Go, Bulldogs!

20:33.482 --> 20:34.608
I'll remember this when it's time

20:34.691 --> 20:37.694
for the school board
to renew your contract, Coach.

20:38.153 --> 20:39.279
Coach?

20:39.363 --> 20:40.614
Walk with me, please.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.543
I signed the papers, too.

21:00.467 --> 21:01.301
Okay.

21:06.682 --> 21:07.766
Best of everything

21:08.517 --> 21:10.310
in your next chapter, Maddie.

21:14.564 --> 21:15.440
You too, Bill.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.411
Man, I forgot my chemistry book.

21:27.494 --> 21:28.578
-Hang on just a minute.
-All right.

21:28.662 --> 21:31.123
How am I supposed to hold up my head
at the family Fourth of July picnic

21:31.206 --> 21:34.543
when my sister starts testifying
about her blockhead son

21:34.626 --> 21:38.422
being God's gift to baseball
and you can't even get up off the bench?

21:40.424 --> 21:42.551
[sighs] You best be comin'.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.313
-Sorry, dude.
-You're good.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.066
Isaac, cinnamon.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.651
-Yes, Chef.
-Isaac, where's that rice?

21:59.735 --> 22:01.611
-On it, Chef.
-The jambalaya's almost done.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.196
Isaac, I need it.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.245
Come in here.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.380
I know about the drinking.

22:22.382 --> 22:24.468
And you are grounded.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.511
No after-school activities,

22:26.595 --> 22:29.473
no friends, no youth group,
no photography, no social media,

22:29.890 --> 22:31.224
no work, nothing.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.894
Just school, home, and church,

22:33.977 --> 22:36.897
and if you don't want me to take away
the very air that you breathe,

22:36.980 --> 22:38.857
give me your phone right this second.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.528
Give it to me.
You are pushing me, Annabelle.

22:45.155 --> 22:48.116
-It was only one, and I didn't--
-I will see you at home.

22:50.410 --> 22:51.328
Go.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.212
[Cal] So why do they call soccer
the beautiful game?

23:00.629 --> 23:02.255
Oh, buddy!

23:02.339 --> 23:05.550
You've been doing outside reading.
I am so proud of you.

23:05.634 --> 23:08.261
Are we truly not gonna talk
about Maddie's divorce being final?

23:08.345 --> 23:09.846
'Cause we don't have to
if you don't want to.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.223
I like to know
what elephants are in the room

23:11.306 --> 23:13.475
before I go banging around in there.
It's better for my chi.

23:13.558 --> 23:14.518
Hmm.

23:16.144 --> 23:17.437
Hey, Ashley.

23:17.521 --> 23:18.897
-Hey!
-Hi.

23:18.980 --> 23:20.315
Sorry I'm late.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.651
I had a patient with an emergency.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.736
Oh, babe, is everything okay?

23:24.820 --> 23:27.197
Yeah. Yeah, you know. One day at a time.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.574
-Okay.
-Let's order a beer. Catch me up.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.660
-Yeah.
-Oh, it's scoreless.

23:31.743 --> 23:32.953
It's always scoreless.

23:33.036 --> 23:35.372
No, I was talking
about the run-in that you had

23:35.455 --> 23:37.749
with Mary Vaughn this afternoon.

23:38.041 --> 23:40.585
Oh, good. Changing the subject, yet again.

23:40.669 --> 23:44.005
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
-No, no, no, no. No. It's fine.

23:44.089 --> 23:47.384
Since we'd already won our season,
I was always gonna let Jackson start.

23:47.467 --> 23:49.928
But then she came in and demanded it.

23:50.011 --> 23:53.723
I am not about to let Mary Vaughn
or any other parent tell me how to coach.

23:54.474 --> 23:55.976
And then Harlan and I dug in.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.060
[clears throat]

23:57.144 --> 24:01.064
I have known Mary Vaughn
and her five sisters since we were little.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.901
You know, making trouble, that's just...
It's like a family trait.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.736
I wouldn't worry about it.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.614
But would you worry
about how we're not paying attention

24:09.698 --> 24:12.033
to the fact that Cal's girlfriend
signed her divorce papers

24:12.117 --> 24:14.744
and he doesn't want to talk about it
with his best friend?

24:14.828 --> 24:15.829
[chuckles]

24:16.621 --> 24:19.291
Speaking as your friend, Cal,
not as a therapist.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.918
-Yeah.
-Fine. [sighs]

24:24.921 --> 24:26.465
What would Dolly Parton do?

24:28.049 --> 24:29.176
[chuckles]

24:29.718 --> 24:31.178
[Garth] I'll grab that crystal.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.734
-See, you're moving your whole body!
-[laughs] I don't know how to stop.

24:56.244 --> 24:57.412
[Noreen] Leave 'em up.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.925
[Maddie] Excuse me, Coach.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.010
Don't you have plays to strategize,

25:12.427 --> 25:14.679
or anti-Castlewood voodoo spells to cast,

25:14.763 --> 25:16.890
or whatever it is that you do
before a big game?

25:17.307 --> 25:19.267
I usually kick back with ESPN.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.852
Oh, that sounds strenuous.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.187
The remote doesn't lift itself.

25:22.270 --> 25:23.396
[chuckles]

25:24.898 --> 25:25.732
So...

25:27.067 --> 25:29.027
I heard you signed your divorce papers.

25:31.613 --> 25:32.489
Well...

25:34.449 --> 25:36.243
you should've heard that from me.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.619
I'm sorry.

25:37.702 --> 25:41.748
I just... I was trying to find
the right time to tell you in person.

25:43.041 --> 25:43.875
It's okay.

25:46.169 --> 25:48.588
I wanted to tell you
at that ridiculous meeting,

25:48.672 --> 25:51.800
but Bill was there,
and, just... Mary Vaughn, and just...

25:55.345 --> 25:56.680
You don't have to explain.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.515
But you should have this.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.025
Erik's cinnamon ice cream.

26:09.109 --> 26:11.903
If you feel like celebrating,
this is perfect for that.

26:13.863 --> 26:14.698
But...

26:16.283 --> 26:18.702
if you feel like sitting by yourself
and crying,

26:20.328 --> 26:21.288
this'll work too.

26:22.163 --> 26:23.873
And there's nothing wrong with that.

26:25.625 --> 26:28.503
No matter how excited
you may feel to get rid of Bill,

26:30.005 --> 26:32.173
the end of a marriage
is something to mourn.

26:33.842 --> 26:34.801
I've been there.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.179
You don't talk about it.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.097
No.

26:41.099 --> 26:42.767
So I get it if you don't want to.

26:45.937 --> 26:46.896
Take your time.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.567
And tell me what you do want.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.174
-I'm working.
-Yes, sir, I can see that,

27:14.674 --> 27:16.635
but I wouldn't interrupt
if it weren't important.

27:16.718 --> 27:17.969
I just need a moment of your time.

27:18.053 --> 27:21.056
-I don't know you or what you want, but--
-One moment.

27:36.029 --> 27:38.740
Please let your daughter do mock trial.

27:39.157 --> 27:42.243
This could be a real-life lesson for her,

27:42.327 --> 27:45.872
and I think that she could have a career
as a lawyer.

27:45.955 --> 27:48.249
Anybody that thinks
Caroline could be a lawyer

27:48.333 --> 27:49.250
don't know my daughter.

27:50.251 --> 27:51.419
Well, I may not,

27:51.503 --> 27:54.047
but I've already seen
a tremendous amount of potential.

27:54.130 --> 27:57.717
And even if...
Even if she doesn't go into law,

27:57.801 --> 28:01.012
this can open her eyes to see
what she could do with her future.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.931
Her mom and I figured that out for her.

28:03.014 --> 28:04.849
Well, a program like this
will look really great

28:04.933 --> 28:06.184
on her college applications.

28:06.601 --> 28:07.686
[laughs]

28:08.395 --> 28:10.021
Matneys don't need college.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.524
We got along fine for years.

28:16.319 --> 28:20.115
You know, I've seen a lot of children
through my work.

28:20.573 --> 28:21.700
So it's really clear to me

28:21.783 --> 28:24.494
that you and your wife have done
a magnificent job with CeCe.

28:25.745 --> 28:28.081
Well, we're real proud of her.

28:28.164 --> 28:29.457
Yeah. What you've taught her

28:29.541 --> 28:31.793
is part of what makes her so great
at mock trial.

28:31.876 --> 28:34.087
She's well-mannered and respectful.

28:34.170 --> 28:37.549
She's... She's got this fire
that none of the other kids have.

28:37.632 --> 28:39.467
-That's the Matney in her.
-Yeah. Uh-huh.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.052
The team needs that.

28:43.096 --> 28:44.264
The world needs that.

28:46.266 --> 28:47.934
I wish you'd give her a chance

28:48.268 --> 28:49.894
to share that gift with us all.

28:53.815 --> 28:55.024
Good night, Mr. Matney.

28:58.820 --> 28:59.946
[door opens]

29:00.697 --> 29:02.949
You didn't even let me
tell my side of the story.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.618
"I'm sorry, Mom!"

29:05.702 --> 29:08.538
I had one drink.
And I didn't even like it.

29:09.038 --> 29:12.125
I don't want to have to find out
what's going on with you

29:12.208 --> 29:15.170
from Maddie or Ty or anybody else.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.088
Oh, so I should've just come to you
and tell you

29:17.172 --> 29:18.882
that I had vodka at a party?

29:18.965 --> 29:20.633
Is that what you did with Grammy?

29:22.469 --> 29:25.180
[sighs] Well, your grammy and I--

29:25.263 --> 29:27.265
I've heard the wild child stories.

29:27.348 --> 29:30.977
Which is why I know
all of the things that can go wrong.

29:31.060 --> 29:34.022
Even when you think you're in control,

29:34.105 --> 29:35.648
bad things can happen.

29:35.732 --> 29:36.941
I was with friends.

29:37.025 --> 29:39.027
Nothing was going to happen to me.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.278
Oh, sweetie, listen.

29:40.361 --> 29:42.739
You don't know what a boy is gonna do.

29:43.364 --> 29:45.658
Especially if you both have been drinking.

29:46.367 --> 29:47.911
[sobbing] Anybody could...

29:48.828 --> 29:50.538
If Ty had not been there--

29:50.622 --> 29:51.790
Don't you get it?

29:52.457 --> 29:54.667
Nobody thinks of me that way.

29:55.418 --> 29:57.378
-What... No.
-I'm not you!

29:58.505 --> 29:59.631
I know.

30:01.049 --> 30:04.511
And believe me, I thank God for that
every night.

30:05.678 --> 30:07.388
Because you are sweeter,

30:08.389 --> 30:09.641
and you're kinder,

30:10.350 --> 30:13.937
and you are better
than I ever was at your age.

30:14.020 --> 30:16.064
Then why are you so upset?

30:17.941 --> 30:19.108
You made a mistake.

30:19.776 --> 30:22.445
Right? You're gonna do that.
We all did that.

30:23.404 --> 30:25.615
But you tried to hide it from me.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.284
Don't do that.

30:29.744 --> 30:31.746
You can tell me anything.

30:33.665 --> 30:34.624
[sobs]

30:37.252 --> 30:38.169
Come here.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.300
Whipped cream vodka is really gross.

30:45.218 --> 30:47.345
-[Dana Sue sniffs]
-I don't ever want it again.

30:47.428 --> 30:49.556
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.224
[laughs, sniffs]

30:52.225 --> 30:55.019
But you're still grounded.
[laughs] You hear me?

31:00.066 --> 31:00.984
Hey, Gabriel.

31:01.651 --> 31:03.236
You memorize that deposition?

31:04.237 --> 31:05.196
Close.

31:07.490 --> 31:09.325
-Your daddy change his mind?
-He sure did.

31:09.409 --> 31:12.787
I told him if I worked it out
so that if I dropped the rugrats off

31:12.871 --> 31:14.539
at the Baptist Church for breakfast,

31:14.622 --> 31:16.666
and Pastor Mose will be taking 'em
to school.

31:16.749 --> 31:18.376
And I can come do this.

31:18.459 --> 31:20.003
-And he's okay with that?
-Yes, ma'am.

31:20.086 --> 31:23.756
I stated a thesis,
I cited evidence to support that thesis,

31:23.840 --> 31:25.925
then gave an emotional appeal for ethos

31:26.009 --> 31:28.553
to try to drive home
exactly what I was trying to say.

31:28.636 --> 31:32.140
-[chuckles] Perfect.
-And he was so impressed.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.976
He told me to come give these kids
a dose of that Matney fire.

31:38.396 --> 31:39.689
All right, team.

31:39.772 --> 31:40.773
Let's get goin'.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.233
Now keep in mind

31:42.317 --> 31:46.905
that persuasion presentation
is 50% of our job here.

31:47.989 --> 31:49.908
Nita, don't worry. We're gonna win.

31:49.991 --> 31:50.825
You better.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.077
Carl and I do not want
to have to cook dinner

31:53.161 --> 31:55.622
for Principal Everett and his wife
if we lose.

31:56.080 --> 31:56.956
Excuse me?

31:58.333 --> 31:59.167
Coach.

32:00.001 --> 32:00.877
What's the matter?

32:01.669 --> 32:02.754
Uh, it's my shoulder.

32:03.254 --> 32:05.506
I woke up this morning
and it's bothering me.

32:06.382 --> 32:07.842
I feel like I might have to rest it.

32:09.260 --> 32:12.722
Today? Does that mean
Jackson starts against Castlewood?

32:12.805 --> 32:16.476
No. Ty, call your dad.
He can get you a cortisone injection.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.520
-Only you know how much it hurts, Ty.
-A lot.

32:22.607 --> 32:23.483
Okay.

32:25.109 --> 32:26.861
Looks like
Jackson's gonna start after all.

32:27.862 --> 32:28.696
Sorry, Coach.

32:29.989 --> 32:32.033
Does that mean
I have to cook for the Everetts?

32:32.116 --> 32:34.243
No, no, no, no. I have faith in our bench.

32:34.619 --> 32:35.662
[Nita sighs]

32:41.167 --> 32:42.251
Isaac, come here.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.712
Let me show you how to measure this.

32:46.089 --> 32:47.423
Fill up your measuring cup...

32:51.719 --> 32:52.929
and then take a knife...

32:54.138 --> 32:55.765
and slice away everything extra.

32:58.142 --> 33:00.144
Yes, so it's all neat and uniform.

33:00.770 --> 33:03.564
It's kind of soothing. Like coloring.

33:04.315 --> 33:05.233
[chuckles]

33:06.317 --> 33:08.653
You know,
this saved my life a few years ago...

33:09.862 --> 33:11.572
when I lost a family member.

33:13.700 --> 33:16.327
Everything was falling apart.

33:16.828 --> 33:17.996
But then one day,

33:18.079 --> 33:20.999
I found one
of my grandmama's old recipe books.

33:22.250 --> 33:25.712
I picked the first recipe I saw,
and I tried it.

33:26.212 --> 33:29.007
And for the first time in weeks,
there were instructions

33:29.090 --> 33:31.676
for what to do and how to do it.

33:32.885 --> 33:34.303
And when I followed them,

33:35.346 --> 33:38.349
everything turned out
exactly the way it was supposed to.

33:39.559 --> 33:41.561
For months, all I did was bake

33:42.854 --> 33:45.148
because it was the only time
I was in control.

33:47.483 --> 33:48.651
And eventually,

33:49.944 --> 33:51.029
I felt safe,

33:52.238 --> 33:54.282
even when I didn't have butter,

33:55.283 --> 33:57.285
sugar and flour in my hands.

34:02.623 --> 34:06.085
See, everyone grieves in their own way.

34:08.421 --> 34:09.797
Don't give up on your dad.

34:13.926 --> 34:14.927
Maybe I should...

34:15.928 --> 34:17.013
drive up and see him.

34:18.264 --> 34:19.265
That's your call.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.392
But if you do,

34:22.602 --> 34:24.520
let me know
if you want company on the drive.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.003
You're sad.

34:49.670 --> 34:50.588
No.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.092
Yeah. [chuckles]

34:54.509 --> 34:55.426
Uh, maybe.

34:56.719 --> 34:58.346
Well, I'm gonna be sad with you.

35:01.140 --> 35:03.017
Trotter, I don't know what to say.

35:04.185 --> 35:06.979
People are usually surprised to find
that I'm capable of being still

35:07.063 --> 35:10.691
and introspective because I'm usually
so quick to offer support and advice

35:10.775 --> 35:12.777
and the occasional excellent joke.

35:12.860 --> 35:13.820
[chuckles]

35:15.029 --> 35:16.614
But I know how to be quiet too.

35:17.824 --> 35:19.826
And I'm even willing to be sad with you,

35:20.743 --> 35:23.996
because we're all entitled to be sad,
but no one should ever be sad alone.

35:29.752 --> 35:31.337
I signed my divorce papers.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.965
And you're sad that you signed them?

35:34.382 --> 35:35.216
No.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.178
I'm sad that I had to sign them.

35:41.430 --> 35:42.431
[chuckles]

35:44.225 --> 35:45.685
I mean, I was raised that...

35:46.561 --> 35:49.939
marriage is till death do us part,
like my parents.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.316
But their journey is not yours.

35:53.401 --> 35:54.360
I know.

35:55.528 --> 35:56.654
And frankly, I'm...

35:57.738 --> 36:00.908
I'm glad that Bill and I are over with.

36:02.118 --> 36:05.037
[sighs] It was just...
It was something that Cal said.

36:05.121 --> 36:08.374
I've been working on him to open up.
Please tell me he said a good thing.

36:08.457 --> 36:10.168
I mean, I think so. Yeah.

36:10.251 --> 36:15.173
He said that I had a right to be sad
about the end of my marriage.

36:16.716 --> 36:17.884
I'm so proud of him.

36:19.260 --> 36:21.012
Because you absolutely do.

36:22.555 --> 36:25.183
And we are talking
Patsy Cline on repeat sad,

36:25.266 --> 36:27.476
and you would still be justified.

36:27.560 --> 36:30.563
I know, but that's just it.
I haven't been that sad,

36:31.439 --> 36:34.609
-and I just... I feel like--
-You think you might be skipping a step,

36:35.193 --> 36:38.279
because it seems
like there's this almighty checklist

36:38.362 --> 36:39.989
in some etiquette book somewhere

36:40.072 --> 36:42.241
that tells you how a proper lady grieves.

36:44.785 --> 36:45.620
Yeah?

36:46.204 --> 36:47.413
Mm. Yeah.

36:48.414 --> 36:50.708
Well, I'm standing beside you
to remind you...

36:51.918 --> 36:54.170
that there are no checklists,

36:55.254 --> 36:56.839
no finish lines,

36:56.923 --> 36:59.634
no final exams, measuring tapes.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.427
It's your life,

37:02.053 --> 37:04.222
your loss, your gain.

37:05.389 --> 37:08.434
You deserve to feel whatever
you wanna feel whenever you feel it.

37:09.644 --> 37:10.645
[sighs]

37:10.728 --> 37:12.813
And as easily as it would be for me

37:12.897 --> 37:15.107
to advocate
on behalf of my dear friend Cal,

37:16.400 --> 37:18.986
I understand if your feet are feeling
the tiniest bit cold

37:19.070 --> 37:20.863
because now that
you're officially available,

37:20.947 --> 37:23.574
it shines a slightly different light
on everything.

37:25.034 --> 37:31.082
But nothing... nothing changes the fact
that you get to decide what you want

37:31.749 --> 37:32.917
and when you want it.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.130
I want to hold hands in the mall.

37:38.798 --> 37:39.840
[chuckles]

37:41.676 --> 37:42.802
Excuse me?

37:42.885 --> 37:44.512
One of my earliest memories

37:45.304 --> 37:47.223
was walking through the mall
with my parents,

37:47.306 --> 37:49.642
and my dad would hold my hand,

37:49.725 --> 37:52.645
and he would hold my mother's hand.

37:53.187 --> 37:54.855
And it... [chuckles]

37:56.482 --> 37:59.944
From that moment on,
it was like everywhere he went...

38:02.113 --> 38:03.281
he held her hand.

38:05.157 --> 38:06.534
All the way up until the end.

38:06.617 --> 38:09.078
It was like he never wanted to let her go,
and...

38:09.161 --> 38:10.621
[sighs, sobs]

38:10.705 --> 38:11.747
Lord.

38:12.164 --> 38:13.040
[sniffs]

38:13.499 --> 38:14.458
I want that.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.003
I do.

38:17.920 --> 38:20.756
And I have really strong feelings for Cal,
but...

38:22.883 --> 38:24.302
what if he's not that guy?

38:26.679 --> 38:28.431
There's only one way to find out.

38:39.525 --> 38:40.568
Great swing.

38:40.651 --> 38:42.653
The tree might even support a tree house.

38:43.237 --> 38:47.158
And it looks like there's enough room
in the backyard for a jungle gym.

38:48.617 --> 38:51.370
And even a jumpy house
for birthday parties.

38:52.580 --> 38:53.706
You like it, Neen?

38:54.749 --> 38:55.750
I think so.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.253
No, I-- I do. I do.

38:59.337 --> 39:02.757
It's just a little different
than what we talked about.

39:02.840 --> 39:06.761
But it's cute, and it's big enough
for a guest bedroom,

39:06.844 --> 39:08.929
-which means you can come visit.
-[laughs]

39:09.430 --> 39:11.265
And I love that I found it myself.

39:12.266 --> 39:14.602
-Well, me and Zillow.
-[laughs]

39:14.685 --> 39:18.522
I don't need Mary Vaughn telling me
where she thinks I should live.

39:22.943 --> 39:25.404
I'm so glad you were able to come
and meet Bill.

39:26.072 --> 39:28.407
Feels good
to have a little part of home here.

39:28.949 --> 39:29.950
We missed you.

39:30.409 --> 39:32.036
I still can't believe
you waited two months

39:32.119 --> 39:34.455
to tell us you were pregnant
and getting married.

39:34.538 --> 39:38.209
[scoffs] I was worried
about what everybody would think.

39:38.793 --> 39:40.503
They're out of their minds excited

39:40.586 --> 39:42.505
they're gonna have a grandbaby
is what they think.

39:42.588 --> 39:45.257
You know, Daddy will get over
Bill not coming to ask for your hand

39:45.341 --> 39:46.884
once he gets to hold the baby.

39:47.718 --> 39:49.553
So where do you want to go now?

39:49.637 --> 39:51.639
Maybe we could grab some coffee
with your friends.

39:51.722 --> 39:52.765
I'd love to meet some.

39:53.516 --> 39:54.767
No coffee for me.

39:55.267 --> 39:56.644
And no friends.

39:57.019 --> 39:59.897
I spend almost all my time
with Bill and his kids,

39:59.980 --> 40:03.526
being a stepmom, stepfiancée,
whatever you wanna call it.

40:04.026 --> 40:05.194
It's hard.

40:05.277 --> 40:07.530
Noreen. Are you happy?

40:07.988 --> 40:10.783
I mean, it's a beautiful little town.

40:10.866 --> 40:12.243
That's not what I meant.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.203
Does Bill make you happy?

40:15.621 --> 40:16.747
He's my fiancé.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.546
I know this isn't
what Mom and Daddy wanted for me,

40:23.629 --> 40:25.047
but it's just not that simple.

40:26.549 --> 40:28.843
And at some point,
you have to own the path you're on.

40:29.468 --> 40:30.678
If you wanna come home,

40:31.178 --> 40:32.972
we'll do everything we can to help you.

40:34.056 --> 40:35.391
So I'll ask again.

40:36.475 --> 40:37.476
Are you happy?

40:46.861 --> 40:47.903
I'm gonna be.

41:04.670 --> 41:06.422
[Harlan] All right, fellas,
three up, three down.

41:06.505 --> 41:09.175
Jackson, your cousin's up first.
Let's strike him out.

41:09.758 --> 41:11.385
Come on, hustle up. Move! Move!

41:13.387 --> 41:14.388
Hey.

41:15.556 --> 41:17.141
When you throw the pitch,

41:17.224 --> 41:18.893
picture Clint's face in the mitt.

41:23.147 --> 41:24.940
[crowd cheering]

41:37.995 --> 41:39.497
[man] That's right!

41:55.387 --> 41:57.097
You're going down, Clint.

41:57.181 --> 41:58.974
Not lower than your IQ.

41:59.058 --> 42:00.267
[woman] All right, Jackson!

42:01.143 --> 42:02.186
Time!

42:06.649 --> 42:08.108
End this play, Jackson!

42:08.859 --> 42:10.361
[man] Too easy, Jackson.

42:23.415 --> 42:24.833
Whoo!

42:30.589 --> 42:31.423
[spits]

42:38.430 --> 42:40.099
That's how you do it, Jackson!

42:40.182 --> 42:43.769
You send those Castlewood boys home
in a burlap sack!

42:47.648 --> 42:49.817
[man] You got him, Jackson!
Come on, strike him out!

42:55.531 --> 42:58.450
-[boys barking]
-[Jackson laughing]

42:58.534 --> 43:00.578
Now that's what victory looks like.

43:04.707 --> 43:08.085
I sent that stuck up, worthless loser
back across the county

43:08.168 --> 43:09.920
where he belongs!

43:10.004 --> 43:10.921
Yeah!

43:11.630 --> 43:14.049
I think you have a long career
in front of you as a pitcher,

43:14.508 --> 43:15.926
but if you change your mind,

43:16.719 --> 43:18.178
you'd make a good coach too.

43:27.813 --> 43:29.106
Good game, Coach.

43:30.149 --> 43:33.611
I just want you to know that your son
is going to be a very fine man, Maddie.

43:34.028 --> 43:34.987
Thank you.

43:36.655 --> 43:37.740
You know, I, um...

43:38.616 --> 43:41.744
I have been thinking a lot about
what you said at the spa last night.

43:42.286 --> 43:43.203
And I meant it.

43:43.746 --> 43:45.998
Take your time,
I am not looking for anything.

43:58.260 --> 43:59.678
[car horn honking]

44:00.387 --> 44:02.556
[car horn honking]

44:13.651 --> 44:14.693
Dad, you trade in your car?

44:14.777 --> 44:17.488
That was a heck of a season, kid.
Congratulations.

44:19.239 --> 44:20.449
[boy] Whoo!

44:21.200 --> 44:22.117
Wait...

44:23.077 --> 44:24.036
Wait. Is this for me?

44:29.500 --> 44:31.251
[Tyler] Oh, my God! Thank you!

44:40.094 --> 44:42.096
[instrumental music playing]
