Which is why we need
a physical sample to study.

04:58.757 --> 04:59.997

14:10.516 --> 14:11.801
Well,
there's a surprise.

14:11.893 --> 14:12.882
What?

14:12.977 --> 14:14.012
You taking his side.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.889
I'm not taking anyone's side,
Nathan.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.813
Oh, please. You could
never separate the personal
from the professional.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.729
Oh, like your problem
with Carter is
strictly professional.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.104
I hate the way
he looks at you.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.686
Oh, I don't look
at her.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.733
Oh, please,
like a shark eyeing chum.

14:26.824 --> 14:27.859
Really?

14:27.950 --> 14:30.032
No, I mean... Yes, I mean
you look good, yeah,

14:30.078 --> 14:32.160
but we got to stay
on topic here.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.366
Am I supposed to ignore that
Mayberry's hitting on my wife?

14:34.457 --> 14:35.788
You do realize
I'm standing right here?

14:35.875 --> 14:38.412
First of all, Nathan,
you and l are separated

14:38.503 --> 14:41.620
so Carter or anyone else
can make a move
anytime they want to.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.091
Second of all,
I'm not the one

14:44.175 --> 14:46.211
who turned
a perfectly pleasant dinner

14:46.260 --> 14:47.796
into a business proposal
and most importantly...

14:47.887 --> 14:48.876
Guys...

14:48.971 --> 14:50.962
I didn't leave you
for a job in DC.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.218
And it always
comes back to this.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.178
Wake me
when it's over.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.219
Reminds me of the last time
we slept together.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.553
Oh!
NATHAN:
At least you can remember it.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.312
You're an ass.
Want to know the truth,
Allison?

15:00.400 --> 15:03.392
We were having
our problems long before
I left Eureka.

15:03.444 --> 15:04.559
But you refused to see it

15:04.654 --> 15:07.111
because it wasn't framed in
your perfect little picture.

15:07.198 --> 15:08.688
I never needed perfect,
Nathan.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.026
I just needed
someone to be there.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.947
Well, here he is.
Go for it!

15:13.037 --> 15:14.243
I got work to do
anyway.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.570
I don't care what you do.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.121
I'm tired of playing
den mother around here.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.415
You know, we're just going
to give you guys a minute...

15:19.460 --> 15:21.576
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You stay here. I'll go.

15:21.671 --> 15:22.956
I quit.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.424
Oh, but, Allison,
hold on!

15:28.010 --> 15:30.262
She's all yours, sport!
Enjoy.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.593
Fargo?

15:35.101 --> 15:36.557
Come on.

15:38.563 --> 15:39.848
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

15:47.989 --> 15:49.525
Come on, Allison.
Pick it up.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.323
This is injustice.
This is madness.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.947
I am the grease, damn it!
The grease.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.117
Shut up for a second.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.661
Hey, Allison,
it's Jack.

15:57.748 --> 16:00.535
Listen, people are acting
a little weird

16:00.626 --> 16:04.414
and frankly,
you're acting a little weird.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.955
But we should really get
together and sort this out

16:07.008 --> 16:08.964
before it gets any worse.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.963
Caught him trying to
burn down Fargo's house.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.001
Too late.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.253
What? I'll kill him!

16:13.306 --> 16:14.466
Not if I kill you first!

16:14.515 --> 16:16.130
Knock it off!

16:16.517 --> 16:17.506
Behave!

16:17.685 --> 16:20.301
Want to lock them up together
and see what happens?

16:21.355 --> 16:22.811
And then I quit!

16:23.316 --> 16:25.932
And it was like
this heavy weight was lifted.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.977
Like l was breathing
for the first time in years.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.987
It was terrifying
and liberating
all at the same time,

16:32.033 --> 16:33.819
like anything was possible.

16:33.868 --> 16:35.984
So... So what do you think?

16:38.247 --> 16:40.158
I think
I've lost my appetite.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.781
I know. I'm sorry.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.495
It's just the first time
that I've ever done this

16:43.544 --> 16:45.045
and itjust seemed like
a good time to start.

16:45.129 --> 16:48.337
Yes, because most therapists
love to work
during their lunch break.

16:48.424 --> 16:49.960
I'm sorry.

16:50.051 --> 16:53.009
I thought you were supposed to
be gentle and supportive.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.511
Frankly, that's getting old.

16:55.765 --> 16:56.754
Okay.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.681
Every day, you people come
to me and bare your souls,

16:59.810 --> 17:01.311
hoping I'll tell you
what to do.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.720
But that is not really
what you're looking for.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.315
It isn't?
No.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.564
You already know
what you should do.

17:06.651 --> 17:08.687
You're just looking
for permission to do
what you want.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.605
I guess I could see
how that could get tiring.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.197
Yeah. Everybody
spills their guts to me,

17:12.240 --> 17:13.525
but who do |
get to talk to?

17:14.283 --> 17:15.318
I've never
thought of it that way.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.699
Of course not.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.700
Because you're all
too narcissistic to consider

17:18.788 --> 17:21.370
that no one really
gives a crap
about your problems,

17:21.415 --> 17:23.667
which aren't really
problems at all.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.366
I mean, come on.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.284
"l'm Allison Blake.
I'm torn between

17:27.380 --> 17:30.247
"my gorgeous, brilliant,
but emotionally
unavailable husband

17:30.383 --> 17:32.999
"and the gorgeous, charming
but immature sheriff.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.508
"What should I do?"

17:35.221 --> 17:39.555
You make a choice,
commit to it and live with
the consequences.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.801
Talk is easy.
Doing is hard.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.805
CARTER:
Passed out? You sure you
didn't just have one too many?

17:46.899 --> 17:48.764
No, no, I believe you.
I'll just...

17:48.859 --> 17:50.941
Yeah, I'll be in touch.
Okay. Bye.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.862
That's 10 calls
in 10 minutes.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.239
I'm going to find Allison.
She doesn't get to quit today.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.066
Quit it.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.238
You quit it!

18:00.329 --> 18:02.069
All right, hit him again!

18:02.415 --> 18:03.450
Keep it up, bitches.

18:03.541 --> 18:06.078
I can do this all day.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.709
CARTER: Okay, Jo,
I'm going to be back shortly.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.255
I need you to stay here
and watch them.

18:10.298 --> 18:11.629
You got it, Chief.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.338
Stop calling me
Chief.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.041
What are you doing?

18:16.429 --> 18:17.418
Nothing.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.420
Jo!

18:20.308 --> 18:21.593
Okay, this is mine.

18:21.642 --> 18:22.722
You are no fun!

18:22.768 --> 18:24.633
You know what would be fun?
Ice-skating!

18:24.729 --> 18:26.765
Never mind. I'm going
to go figure this out.

18:26.856 --> 18:29.563
You stay here and do
whatever it is
that you're not doing.

18:29.984 --> 18:31.269
(BOTH GRUNTING)

18:36.991 --> 18:38.447
GLAZER: I don't think
I'm following you, sir.

18:38.492 --> 18:39.948
It's not that complicated,
Dr. Glazer.

18:39.994 --> 18:42.781
I need you
to give me access codes
through the firewall.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.866
There are strict
safety calls in place.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.991
What you're suggesting
could be catastrophic.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.085
I need this, Louis.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.463
The current plan for making
contact with the artifact

18:54.508 --> 18:57.295
follows a progression of steps
over the next several months

18:57.386 --> 19:01.675
all carefully designed
and approved by you.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.511
I thought you were
a team player, Glazer.

19:04.852 --> 19:07.468
But if you're not with me,
I can do it myself.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.977
But Dr. Stark...

19:09.231 --> 19:10.971
I don't need you.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.056
Very well.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.938
I don't need anyone.

19:20.743 --> 19:21.732
Allison?

19:28.209 --> 19:29.198
You home?

19:33.339 --> 19:34.328
Hey, Carter.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.167
What are you doing here?

19:36.217 --> 19:37.206
l was worried.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.920
You're not answering
your cell phone

19:39.011 --> 19:42.174
and things are getting
really weird.

19:43.057 --> 19:44.137
I need your help.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.390
Oh, that's nice.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.675
Are you okay?

19:47.728 --> 19:48.717
Yeah.

19:48.896 --> 19:52.229
Believe it or not,
I've been spending some time
with Beverly.

19:52.316 --> 19:53.772
ln session?

19:53.901 --> 19:55.141
Well, we weren't shopping.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.268
Right. Was it helpful?

19:57.363 --> 19:59.820
Well, I've had
a breakthrough.

19:59.865 --> 20:00.854
Good.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.902
So, does that mean
you've reconsidered?

20:03.035 --> 20:04.024
Oh, I have.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.031
Oh, great.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.036
Because we've got
to figure out
what's gotten into people.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.489
I mean... Have you told Stark
you're not quitting?

20:09.542 --> 20:11.157
I'm not talking
about my job.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.246
I'm talking about
what I want.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.044
In regards to?

20:16.632 --> 20:17.621
This.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.673
Yeah. Allison.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.426
I'm making a choice
and committing to it.

20:22.513 --> 20:24.424
Talk is easy.
Doing is hard.

20:24.515 --> 20:26.426
Yeah,
and what are you doing?

20:26.517 --> 20:28.257
Exactly what I want.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.271
Yeah. I can't.

20:32.398 --> 20:33.387
Really?

20:33.607 --> 20:34.642
Yeah.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.440
(STAMMERING) Oh, no.
I mean, I can!

20:36.527 --> 20:37.892
l'm fully capable,
but...

20:37.945 --> 20:39.060
What are you
talking about?

20:39.155 --> 20:40.611
You're not yourself.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.735
People aren't acting
like themselves.

20:43.826 --> 20:46.067
And as much as
I would love to...

20:46.162 --> 20:47.777
I completely understand.

20:47.872 --> 20:48.861
Yeah.

20:49.915 --> 20:50.904
Good.

20:51.792 --> 20:52.827
Now get out.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.783
What? No. If you
just think...

20:54.879 --> 20:56.790
Yeah, I'm done thinking.
I'm doing.

21:05.639 --> 21:08.506
Henry, Henry, Spencer said
I'd find you here.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.091
Look things are
getting a little crazy.

21:10.144 --> 21:11.179
I need to pick your brain.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.430
You and everybody else.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.681
I don't follow.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.264
I mean that's all
anyone around here does,

21:16.317 --> 21:17.682
is feed on me.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.893
Global Dynamics,
D.O.D., you.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.685
l'm intellectual carrion.

21:21.781 --> 21:22.770
CHEF: Order up!

21:22.907 --> 21:24.647
Not you, too.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.115
HENRY:
It's all about producing,

21:27.203 --> 21:28.409
getting ahead of
everybody else

21:28.454 --> 21:30.285
but that's not
what I signed up for.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.289
It's a little
early in the morning
for scotch, isn't it?

21:33.959 --> 21:37.622
No. I came to Eureka
to create without restriction

21:37.713 --> 21:39.453
or agenda, to make the world
a better place,

21:39.548 --> 21:41.129
you know,
like the new cell tower,

21:41.217 --> 21:43.458
but eventually it all gets
digested by the machine

21:43.511 --> 21:47.345
and re-tasked
and turned into something
very, very unappetizing!

21:47.515 --> 21:48.925
Henry, I need you
to focus for me,

21:48.974 --> 21:50.305
just for a second.

21:50.351 --> 21:51.557
You need
something from me?

21:51.644 --> 21:53.100
Well, there's a shocker!

21:53.187 --> 21:54.176
CHEF: Order up!

21:54.688 --> 21:56.644
CARTER:
Okay, I'm just going to
ignore that and push on.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.897
People seem to be
under the influence,

21:58.984 --> 22:00.815
doing whatever the hell
they want, like they're drunk.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.237
Some of us are.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.277
Could it be an infection?

22:04.907 --> 22:07.740
Something like
contagious Tourette's?

22:08.327 --> 22:10.158
How did you get
all those big words

22:10.204 --> 22:11.819
to come out of
that tiny, little brain?

22:11.914 --> 22:12.903
(SIGHS)

22:13.290 --> 22:16.077
You know what?
You're a really mean drunk.

22:16.168 --> 22:19.660
Caribou pepper steak
with roasted garlic.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.453
Sheriff, you hungry?

22:21.549 --> 22:23.335
Not anymore.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.503
Okay, well, the seats
are for customers

22:25.594 --> 22:27.585
so either order something
or get your ass up.

22:29.682 --> 22:30.671
You see?

22:30.766 --> 22:32.722
CHEF:
There you go! There's
your blue plate special!

22:32.977 --> 22:34.683
See?
lt's spreading.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.097
So, how's it
being transmitted?

22:36.188 --> 22:37.689
Is it a virus?

22:39.149 --> 22:40.400
I don't know.

22:41.777 --> 22:45.770
I don't care.
The doctor is out.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.447
Henry, I can't solve
this alone.

22:48.534 --> 22:51.367
Well, then you're
really screwed!

22:52.037 --> 22:54.699
Vincent, there's
a tuft of hair in my food.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.492
There you go.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.043
And this is well done.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.204
You know
I like my meat bloody.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.588
I am so sorry.

23:09.305 --> 23:11.341
Let me fix that for you
quick as a wink.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.804

34:50.922 --> 34:53.129
Man, nil.

35:04.436 --> 35:05.425
(GROANS)

35:05.687 --> 35:07.348
What's going on?

35:07.439 --> 35:09.100
Striking back
for mother nature.

35:09.190 --> 35:10.225
Taggan?

35:10.275 --> 35:11.685
I know what you're up to,
Shenﬁ.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.767
You were going to burn
these beautiful plants.

35:13.862 --> 35:16.103
For good reason,
you jackass!

35:20.827 --> 35:23.614
Unless you want to
roast your chestnuts,
back off.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.196
You wouldn't dare.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.371
Try me.

35:31.171 --> 35:33.082
(SCREAMING)

35:56.988 --> 35:59.695
All right, folks.
Freeze-dried astronaut soup.

35:59.824 --> 36:02.315
l have no clue what it is,
but get it while it's hot.

36:02.410 --> 36:04.275
CARTER:
Got room for one more?

36:04.496 --> 36:06.487
Sorry, Mary.
Manger's full.
Try the cafe.

36:06.581 --> 36:07.787
CARTER:
Yeah, it's packed.

36:07.832 --> 36:10.539
Besides, I want Taggart
where I can see him.

36:11.336 --> 36:12.325
Or smell him.

36:12.671 --> 36:13.660
Yeah.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.538
I hope the pollen effect
wears off

36:16.633 --> 36:18.669
before we start
to bathe these guys.

36:18.718 --> 36:20.458
Too late.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.501
What?

36:22.180 --> 36:23.966
Fargo missed bucket time.

36:24.057 --> 36:25.172
Oh, that's disgusting.

36:25.266 --> 36:26.472
But the good news is,

36:26.518 --> 36:28.179
is that the swearing has
gone down considerably.

36:28.269 --> 36:30.555
And nobody's tried
to spit in my face
for the past couple of hours.

36:30.647 --> 36:31.727
Oh, that's progress.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.179
No.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.773
So, is this everybody?

36:38.863 --> 36:39.852
One more stop.

36:48.081 --> 36:50.037
Is it safe to come in?

36:50.291 --> 36:51.417
Relatively.

36:51.501 --> 36:54.664
It might have been nice
if you chained us
to a bed last night.

36:55.839 --> 36:56.919
Stop it.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.086
Didn't say anything.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.960
l'm embarrassed enough
as it is.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.007
Again, I am so sorry.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.213
(GROANS)

37:03.263 --> 37:05.549
I guess I have
a few apologies to make.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.682
And thank you
for stopping me.

37:09.728 --> 37:10.717
You're welcome.

37:19.487 --> 37:22.103
I guess I should thank you
for stopping me, too.

37:24.284 --> 37:26.024
That was pretty heroic.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.365
Oh, you mean
here at Beverly's.

37:31.583 --> 37:32.572
Yeah.

37:32.834 --> 37:33.994
Yeah.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.415
Here, come on.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.877
Oh, oh, oh,
I quit myjob.

37:42.385 --> 37:44.376
I'm not looking toward
to that conversation.

37:45.013 --> 37:47.174
Where's Nathan?
Chained to a radiator
or something?

37:47.265 --> 37:49.301
l have no idea.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.307
Sorry, I've been
a little busy saving
the world,

37:52.395 --> 37:54.431
so, you know... Again.

37:55.023 --> 37:56.263
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

37:57.692 --> 37:59.523
Security breach
in Section Five.

38:01.404 --> 38:02.393
Come on!

38:05.492 --> 38:07.323
Damn it!

38:12.957 --> 38:15.949
COMPUTER:
Machine artifact chamber,
access granted.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.923
CARTER: So what exactly
are we dealing with here?

38:27.972 --> 38:29.473
All I know is
there's something inside
Section Five

38:29.557 --> 38:31.058
that Nathan is
obsessed with.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.643
Something that he thinks
will change the world.

38:32.685 --> 38:33.970
Of course it's
incredibly dangerous.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.477
Have you ever known anything
to change the world
that wasn't?

38:36.564 --> 38:38.020
Velcro.

38:38.107 --> 38:40.063
You're right.
It's not the right time.

38:40.985 --> 38:43.647
Wow. So everybody's
left the building.

38:43.696 --> 38:45.948
The biohazard containment
system's been activated.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.275
They must evacuate.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.316
One guess
who's responsible.

39:13.768 --> 39:16.760
VOICE ON PA: Danger.
Fail-safe system disengaged.

39:17.689 --> 39:18.849
(ALARM WAILING)

39:21.192 --> 39:23.569
Allison, he might
still be affected

39:23.653 --> 39:25.814
and he's not
too happy with you.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.695
No, no, I can reach him.
I know I can.

39:27.782 --> 39:30.148
I can't let you
take that risk.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.738
I need to. Please.

39:38.459 --> 39:39.448
Nathan.

39:39.544 --> 39:40.533
You need to leave now.

39:41.713 --> 39:42.873
Listen, please.

39:43.840 --> 39:47.298
There's nothing you can say.
I need to do this.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.374
No, you don't.

39:48.928 --> 39:49.917
I want to do this.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.549
You don't have
anything to prove.

39:52.599 --> 39:54.635
Not to me.
Not to anyone.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.061
I already lost you.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.140
The artifact is
all l have left.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.896
That's not true.
I'm here now.

40:08.197 --> 40:10.574
You don't know
what's inside that room.

40:10.617 --> 40:12.448
But you know
what's out here.

40:12.535 --> 40:15.493
We need you.
The town needs you.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.241
I need you.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.594
I need you, too.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.512
It's okay.
It's okay, honey.

40:35.725 --> 40:37.761
You're okay.
It's okay.

40:37.852 --> 40:40.969
VOICE ON PA:
Fai/safe reinstated.
Safety status normal.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.856
CARTER:
So, I guess that's it then.

40:53.952 --> 40:58.286
And hopefully we can all now
return to our normal routines.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.664
The crazy rainforest plants
have been,

41:02.627 --> 41:05.494
let's just say, recycled.

41:06.089 --> 41:09.206
And fortunate/y no lives
were lost in the process.

41:09.384 --> 41:11.545
So, while someone you know

41:11.636 --> 41:16.221
may have done
or said something
that you didn't like,

41:16.849 --> 41:20.057
please remember that you
probably said or did something

41:20.144 --> 41:22.476
that you're
not too proud of either.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.972
Let's try to put all this
behind us.

41:25.566 --> 41:26.897
Forgive and forget.

41:27.026 --> 41:29.893
And let bygones be bygones.

41:37.286 --> 41:40.198
Fellow Eurekans,
I just want to touch base

41:40.289 --> 41:41.415
and tie up a few loose ends.

41:41.499 --> 41:42.488
You like my speech?

41:42.583 --> 41:43.834
It was great.
Thanks.

41:45.503 --> 41:48.666
Look, I just wanted
to thank you for,

41:49.549 --> 41:51.505
you know, not taking advantage
of the situation.

41:51.592 --> 41:53.128
Oh. Yeah.

41:53.219 --> 41:56.211
This whole debacle
has raised a few questions
for all of us.

41:56.305 --> 41:57.841
And I'm no exception.

41:57.890 --> 42:00.597
You were a gentleman
and I appreciate it.

42:01.394 --> 42:02.634
Thank you, Carter.

42:02.687 --> 42:04.177
HENRY: I apologize for
anything I may have said.

42:04.230 --> 42:06.186
Oh, we're back
to Carter now?

42:07.358 --> 42:10.441
Just take it slowly.
None of us are going anywhere.

42:10.737 --> 42:12.819
HENRY:
This was a difficult decision
for me to make

42:12.864 --> 42:16.072
and it's been quite a journey,

42:16.576 --> 42:19.318
but it’s time for me
to leave Eureka.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.411
So, this is goodbye

42:27.545 --> 42:28.785
and God bless.
