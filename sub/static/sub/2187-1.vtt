02:27.522 --> 02:28.522
Hey, Jerry.

02:29.274 --> 02:33.026
- Hey, Mr. Kowalski.
- Call me Dennis. It's okay.

02:34.404 --> 02:38.031
Just wanted to say, we're very pleased.
You're doing a great job.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.241
Thank you, Mr. Kowalski.

02:39.325 --> 02:42.411
That's what I told that lady
from the courts. "A great job," I said.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.496
- She's your lawyer?
- She's a court-appointed psychiatrist,

02:44.581 --> 02:46.915
Dennis. Thank you, for...
Thank you for saying that.

02:47.041 --> 02:50.377
No problem. So, Jerry, the thing is,

02:50.461 --> 02:53.589
is Milton Fixtures, every year,
has the company party.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.174
- A barbecue.
- Okay.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.510
And we get one representative
from each department to help put it on,

02:58.595 --> 02:59.761
usually the new guy.

02:59.846 --> 03:03.015
And the new guy in shipping is you.

03:04.058 --> 03:06.935
So you want me to help plan a party?

03:06.978 --> 03:10.522
It's voluntary, off-the-clock.
There will be others, too.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.858
Someone from sales, a guy from design,

03:12.942 --> 03:15.611
that cute English chick
in accounting, Fiona.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.113
- You wanna do it?
- Yes, I do. Of course, I do. Thank you.

03:18.239 --> 03:19.698
Cool. First meeting
is tomorrow night at 5:00

03:19.782 --> 03:22.284
- in the sales conference room.
- Yeah, I wanna get it on. I wanna get it on.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.744
- The company buys pizza and beer.
- Okay, I'm in.

03:23.786 --> 03:27.539
- Thank you, Dennis. Thank you, Dennis.
- It'll be fun. Okay, okay.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.556
Bosco.

03:44.682 --> 03:47.476
Who's my guy?
Who's my guy?

03:47.560 --> 03:51.396
Who's my guy? Who's my guy?
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

03:51.814 --> 03:54.316
You're a good boy.
You're a good boy.

04:03.493 --> 04:06.036
- What you doing, Jerry?
- Something for work.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.330
Those assholes give you homework now?

04:08.414 --> 04:11.667
Trying on a shirt for tomorrow.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.169
They got something that they want me to do.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.714
- A shirt? Shouldn't that be a straitjacket?
- Shut up.

04:17.798 --> 04:20.384
You act like they're doing you a favor
letting you work there,

04:20.468 --> 04:23.845
like they should be able to fuck you
in the ass without lube whenever they want.

04:23.930 --> 04:28.016
Like some big privilege,
letting you work for free on their picnic.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.000
- How do you know about the picnic?
- I know everything, Jerry.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.815
- At 6:00...
- I'm not talking to you.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.943
They mock you
the second you leave the room, Jerry.

04:38.027 --> 04:41.154
- You're an unstable crybaby.
- I am not a crybaby.

04:41.197 --> 04:44.157
You're crying right now, liar. Come on.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.800
The only reason they don't fire your ass

04:45.827 --> 04:48.620
is because you're so hopelessly pathetic,
you amuse them.

04:48.705 --> 04:49.705
Shut up!

04:57.922 --> 05:01.550
Before we break up here,
I wanna go over the assignments.

05:02.593 --> 05:05.971
We're just gonna go around the table, okay?
Can your comment wait?

05:06.055 --> 05:08.307
I just wanna say that the picnic
is gonna be a good place

05:08.391 --> 05:11.685
to reach out and form relationships
with other people.

05:14.731 --> 05:15.897
Duly noted, Jerry.

05:16.607 --> 05:17.816
We all wanna get out of here,

05:17.900 --> 05:21.945
so, John, you'll be setting up
the barbecue grills in the parking lot.

05:22.071 --> 05:25.407
Dave's bringing drinks.
Sheryl's providing decorations,

05:25.450 --> 05:28.410
and Fiona's doing the music.
Any questions?

05:28.453 --> 05:31.413
Yeah. I've got an idea,
while we were sitting here.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.290
You know the office corridor?

05:33.374 --> 05:36.460
I thought it would be the perfect
place for a conga line.

05:37.086 --> 05:40.213
- Like at a wedding?
- Or a cruise ship.

05:40.256 --> 05:42.341
It's really easy, anyone can conga.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.217
I'll set my head on fire before I conga.

05:44.260 --> 05:47.596
Men are afraid to dance.
The male ego is too fragile.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.891
I'm not afraid. I'm a man.
I think it sounds real fun.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.268
Thanks, Jerry.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.228
Well, it's not the coolest
thing in the world,

05:55.271 --> 05:57.647
but we are talking about a party
in a toilet factory after all.

05:57.732 --> 06:00.192
Okay, it's settled,
we'll go with a conga line.

06:00.276 --> 06:01.943
Moving on. Jerry?

06:02.028 --> 06:05.697
I'm setting up the PA system tomorrow,
so if everything works out, I'm good to go.

06:05.782 --> 06:11.453
And I thank you all.
And my extension in shipping is 5-1865.

06:11.579 --> 06:12.704
Running for office, Jerry?

06:12.789 --> 06:14.414
- No.
- Dave, go screw yourself.

06:14.540 --> 06:18.377
Sheryl, Dave, come on. We're done here.
We'll see you all at the picnic.

06:18.461 --> 06:22.130
Anyone who wants
the leftover pizza, please take it.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.521
Hey, do you want any of this pizza, John?

06:37.605 --> 06:39.147
Cold pizza? No, thank you.

06:39.232 --> 06:43.360
- Free pizza. What's better than free pizza?
- Lots of things.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.071
- Sushi, for example.
- That's like raw fish, right?

06:46.155 --> 06:50.826
No. It's perfectly cooked rice,
seasoned by a master chef,

06:50.868 --> 06:53.495
on top of which he places
specially selected slices

06:53.538 --> 06:56.665
of the highest quality,
line-caught ocean fish.

06:56.749 --> 06:59.251
Raw fish. Gross.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.336
You should stick to fast food.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.966
- Jerry?
- Hey, Fiona.

07:06.509 --> 07:10.762
Hey. Can your sound system
play music from an iPod?

07:11.514 --> 07:12.681
I think so, yeah.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.599
Cool, it's a plan. See you.

07:31.367 --> 07:35.871
- How are you doing, Jerry?
- Very well, thank you. Excellent. Yeah.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.789
Do tell.

07:37.874 --> 07:41.877
Well, they like me at work.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.545
You're a likeable man.

07:43.588 --> 07:48.717
We're having, a what-do-you-call-it, a picnic.
And they asked me to help out on it.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.635
I was afraid to say yes.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.515
- And then I said yes.
- And?

07:56.225 --> 07:58.393
And now I'm setting up the sound system.

07:59.145 --> 08:02.397
That's wonderful news.
You're becoming part of something.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.983
Any side effects with the meds?

08:05.151 --> 08:07.068
I don't know.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.654
- Are you taking them?
- I don't know.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.282
You have to take them.

08:12.700 --> 08:13.950
Okay.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.538
- Any thoughts of suicide?
- No. None.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.833
Do you ever hear voices?

08:22.418 --> 08:27.464
Voices? No. I mean,
when someone is talking to me.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.092
You hesitated a little bit there.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.928
It just makes me think of my mother.

08:34.263 --> 08:37.057
"Angels" was what she called her voices.

08:37.808 --> 08:38.975
Yeah.

08:40.102 --> 08:43.813
Angels were her coping strategy.
The voices were real to her.

08:43.898 --> 08:47.442
Angels were a reasonable attempt
to craft a logical explanation.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.110
I know, I know that. I know that, yeah.

08:49.153 --> 08:52.072
I know. She was the best mother
that she knew how to be. You know?

08:52.448 --> 08:54.074
Right. Exactly.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.786
Do you have any questions for me, Jerry?

08:57.912 --> 08:59.788
Yeah. I got a big one for you.

09:00.706 --> 09:01.915
Okay.

09:03.292 --> 09:06.670
There's a girl. I like her.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.297
Go on.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.217
I don't know how much
to tell her, you know,

09:12.301 --> 09:14.177
about you and this, and my mom and stuff.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.303
And?

09:16.556 --> 09:18.390
I don't wanna scare her away,

09:20.142 --> 09:21.851
but I don't wanna lie to her either.

09:22.770 --> 09:25.146
I'm thinking that if the subject comes up,

09:25.273 --> 09:29.609
I'll just tell her, but if it doesn't,

09:29.652 --> 09:31.444
I'll just leave it be.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.406
You answered your own question, Jerry.

09:34.490 --> 09:35.657
Why are you smiling?

09:36.742 --> 09:39.536
- We're gonna conga tomorrow.
- Conga?

09:40.329 --> 09:44.541
Yeah. Yeah, like at a wedding.
It's gonna be amazing.

09:45.334 --> 09:46.585
Conga?

10:44.268 --> 10:50.815
Hey, buddy. Bosco, what a day, what a day.
I wish you could have been there.

10:52.401 --> 10:53.902
Did you fuck the bitch?

10:56.030 --> 10:57.530
I don't have to answer that.

10:57.573 --> 11:00.909
And you'll never fuck her either
because you disgust her.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.411
Yeah, shut up, cat.

11:03.496 --> 11:07.332
She's from England, Jerry.
In her eyes, you're a ridiculous peasant.

11:07.416 --> 11:12.003
Yeah. Guess what?
I'm not a peasant, Mr. Whiskers.

11:12.588 --> 11:15.590
I'm thinking that this is
a real good time for a walk. Jerry?

11:15.633 --> 11:17.592
I think that's a fantastic idea.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.094
You're out your league.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.596
She drinks tea in carriages and fucks men

11:21.639 --> 11:24.599
with names like Nigel or Aidan
or Lord Ribblesdale.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.309
Not Jerry Hickfang.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.853
- Go choke on a hairball.
- Cat-hater.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.605
Come on, Bosco. Let's go, buddy. Come on.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.567
Sing a happy song

11:34.819 --> 11:38.571
Come on, sing along, sing a happy song

11:38.614 --> 11:42.117
Get up and dance, sing a happy song

11:42.159 --> 11:44.703
Come on, make some romance
Sing a happy song

11:44.787 --> 11:49.124
- Hey, Jer, give me a break.
- Okay, I'll tone it down a little bit.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.626
You have the greatest hair, Tom.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.671
In the back, it's awesome.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.431
Shift's over, Jer.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.489
- Jerry?
- Hi.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.616
Fiona.

12:25.202 --> 12:28.037
You said I should come by
accounting some time.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.831
- I did?
- Yeah.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.792
When we were getting ready for the picnic.

12:32.835 --> 12:36.421
No. I don't recall saying that.

12:36.505 --> 12:39.382
Hi, Jerry. I'm Lisa. Accounts Receivable.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.177
Jerry, Packing and Shipping.

12:43.512 --> 12:46.222
Some of the accounting chicks
are going out for a couple of drinks.

12:46.307 --> 12:49.017
If you wanna pack and ship out with us?

12:49.059 --> 12:50.852
Yeah. That sounds... Yeah.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.255
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's get going.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.482
Okay.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.695
So he looks me in the eye and he says,

13:00.780 --> 13:03.698
"Let's move to America, Fi.
Let's get married."

13:03.783 --> 13:07.202
So, after I've sold everything and moved,

13:07.286 --> 13:10.872
that's when the knobhead decides
that he's not the marrying type.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.374
Yeah, six months later, he marries Jill.

13:13.959 --> 13:17.587
Now they got three kids,
and I'm stuck in this stupid temp job.

13:17.671 --> 13:19.798
I think it's time to move back home.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.841
I know karate.

13:28.098 --> 13:30.433
Thanks for coming out, Jerry. It's cool.

13:34.271 --> 13:36.981
Do you want my last Krunchy Choo Choo?
I only had a bite.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.483
Yeah, sure.

13:41.237 --> 13:45.907
Hey, can you give me a ride to my car?
Or just home, you know.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.620
Sorry.

13:51.705 --> 13:53.790
You're giving a ride to Fiona.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.376
No, no, no, no, no. It's okay, Jerry.
I've got a lift so...

13:56.460 --> 13:59.379
I don't mind, Fi,
I'd love to give you a ride.

14:02.716 --> 14:05.385
Okay. So you...

14:06.095 --> 14:09.097
You... Okay. I can just get a cab.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.656
What are you doing this weekend?

14:26.991 --> 14:29.242
- I was hoping on...
- There is this cool Chinese restaurant

14:29.285 --> 14:31.911
that I wanna take you to, Shi Shan.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.121
Chinese?

14:33.205 --> 14:37.917
Yeah, but it's more than just egg rolls
and fortune cookies. Do you wanna go?

14:38.794 --> 14:40.169
- When?
- On Friday night.

14:40.254 --> 14:43.006
- I'll pick you up after work.
- No, it's... It's all right. I don't need a lift.

14:43.090 --> 14:46.134
Or just meet there, then?
The show starts at 7:00.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.304
- There's a show?
- A show, yes.

14:49.471 --> 14:52.098
More than just a show.
The best spectacle in the world.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.517
You'll love it. Prepare to be amazed.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.019
Okay. Cool.

14:56.145 --> 14:59.063
I'll get there early. I'll save you a seat.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.648
- All right.
- All right?

15:05.195 --> 15:08.531
- All right. Thanks for the ride, Jerry.
- All right. No problem, Fiona.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.283
Have a good night.

15:30.179 --> 15:34.474
I got a date with Fiona on Friday night,
from England.

15:34.516 --> 15:38.102
Well, fuck me. I'm an asshole.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.939
I apologize, man. You were right.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.263
Cat food's in the kitchen, Jer,
and I can't open the can.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.943
I don't have thumbs.

16:01.210 --> 16:05.755
Who's my good boy? Who's my good boy?

16:11.095 --> 16:12.512
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Lisa.

16:12.554 --> 16:13.680
- Hey.
- Alison.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.223
- What's up?
- Where's Fiona?

16:15.891 --> 16:17.725
She just left.
Do you have something for her?

16:17.810 --> 16:21.270
Yes, she needs this address. Shi Shan.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.440
- It's the restaurant where we're gonna meet.
- I'll make sure she gets it.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.735
- Is there anything else?
- No.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.780
Make sure she gets that, okay?
It's important.

16:30.864 --> 16:32.281
- Yeah, we'll make sure.
- Okay.

16:37.287 --> 16:40.331
- Is he gone?
- Yeah, he's gone.

16:40.416 --> 16:44.002
- What is this about?
- It's this Chinese restaurant.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.628
I said I might meet him over there.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.922
No. You can't. Tonight's karaoke.

16:48.048 --> 16:51.175
Yeah, karaoke. He'll get over it.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.594
Well, just call him and tell him,
you can't make it.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.596
No, I don't want to upset him.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.975
I'll wait until the office closes and then
I'll leave a message on voicemail.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.381
You're a real sweetheart, Fiona.

17:10.319 --> 17:13.573
I got a girl named Li
She really drives me crazy

17:14.700 --> 17:18.786
I got a girl named Li
She really drives me crazy

17:19.788 --> 17:22.415
She got tiny feet and almond eyes

17:22.458 --> 17:24.500
Long black hair and golden skin

17:24.792 --> 17:26.627
She makes me want to scream

17:29.381 --> 17:32.884
I got a girl named Li
She really drives me crazy

17:33.052 --> 17:36.637
I don't want to lose you
This good thing

17:37.931 --> 17:41.476
That I got 'Cause if I do

17:41.518 --> 17:43.019
I will surely

17:44.313 --> 17:46.481
Surely lose a lot

17:46.565 --> 17:47.982
'Cause your love

17:59.453 --> 18:01.120
- Like thunder
- Thunder

18:01.288 --> 18:02.497
- Lightning
- Lightning

18:03.499 --> 18:05.708
The way you love me is frightening

18:05.834 --> 18:10.421
You better knock, knock, knock on wood

18:11.173 --> 18:12.423
Baby

18:16.136 --> 18:17.261
Hey, fish.

18:17.888 --> 18:21.516
Hey, Jerry. How are you doing, man?

18:22.643 --> 18:24.310
I'm a little bit bummed.

18:24.728 --> 18:27.730
No, duh. She stood you up.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.109
I'm sure there's a reason.

18:31.193 --> 18:36.572
I sure hope so. I wish could help you, Jerry
but I'm just a fish.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.908
For any MC in any 52 states

18:38.992 --> 18:41.619
I get psycho killer Norman Bates

18:41.703 --> 18:44.455
My producers slam
My flow is like, "Bam"

18:44.540 --> 18:48.417
Jump on the stage and then I dip down

18:48.502 --> 18:49.752
Oh, yeah

18:50.838 --> 18:52.880
Oh, baby, I like it raw

19:12.109 --> 19:14.485
- Jesus.
- Have you seen Alison?

19:14.611 --> 19:16.571
No. I think she's gonna
keep going, actually.

19:16.613 --> 19:17.738
Shit.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.866
Now my phone's fucked.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.577
No, it's all right.

19:22.619 --> 19:26.831
- I was gonna walk back to the plant.
- No, I'll give you a ride.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.958
- Yeah, okay.
- Thank you! You're the best.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.626
- Okay, you ready?
- Okay.

19:30.711 --> 19:31.961
- Go!
- Go.

19:34.923 --> 19:36.424
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

19:36.466 --> 19:40.261
It's so horrible!
It's like being in England again.

19:54.526 --> 19:57.570
- You want me to wait?
- No, have a good night.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.340
Bloody hell.

20:22.971 --> 20:24.055
Shit.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.267
Jerry!

21:10.644 --> 21:11.936
Fiona?

21:13.522 --> 21:14.689
Jerry!

21:24.783 --> 21:27.576
Fiona. You're soaked. Get in.

21:29.037 --> 21:30.705
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

21:32.207 --> 21:33.582
What are you doing out here?

21:34.293 --> 21:35.876
I was listening to music.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.421
I went to Shi Shan. I didn't see you there.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.173
Didn't you get my message?

21:42.718 --> 21:45.720
No. No. No.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.638
I am so sorry, Jerry.

21:53.145 --> 21:57.231
You want a hot chocolate
or something?

21:57.816 --> 22:00.651
I suppose I owe you, don't I? Go on then.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.361
I'm freezing.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.530
I... You're sitting on a blanket.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.668
- Don't stare, Jerry.
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

22:17.794 --> 22:19.234
- It's all right.
- I'm really sorry.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.339
It's not the end of the world, Jerry.

22:26.094 --> 22:28.387
God, I'm starving.

22:30.098 --> 22:31.432
Let's get something to eat.

22:31.475 --> 22:34.393
- I got crackers in the glove box.
- No.

22:34.436 --> 22:37.938
We need something horrible
and greasy tonight. Do you know Doran's?

22:39.191 --> 22:44.612
You gonna love it. It's this terrible, cheap,
all-night burger joint out by the county line.

22:44.654 --> 22:46.364
- We go.
- And you wanna go there tonight?

22:46.448 --> 22:51.369
Yes and yes. Full steam ahead, Captain,
and don't spare the chili.

22:51.453 --> 22:52.578
Yeah. All right.

23:03.006 --> 23:05.800
You know, they say a lot of things
about you up in accounting.

23:05.842 --> 23:07.343
Like what?

23:08.136 --> 23:11.097
Well, that arty chick Lisa,
she thinks you're hot.

23:12.641 --> 23:15.476
And everybody else,
we just wonder where you're from.

23:16.895 --> 23:20.356
My family moved here
from Berlin when I was seven.

23:21.817 --> 23:25.444
You know, a kid's got to go
where his parents take him.

23:33.161 --> 23:35.204
I don't even have that excuse.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.375
Why do you live here then?

23:39.459 --> 23:42.670
Oh, God. Well, if you find out, call me.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.215
No, sorry.
No, that came out wrong, I'm sorry.

23:46.299 --> 23:49.510
- You don't like Milton?
- No, no, no, it's... It's nice.

23:49.636 --> 23:53.264
You know, the people are friendly.
It's pretty...

23:53.473 --> 23:57.184
No. High-school football
and karaoke bars isn't enough.

23:58.812 --> 24:00.020
I'm bored.

24:01.064 --> 24:02.606
Insanely bored.

24:03.984 --> 24:07.153
- You like heaven better, huh?
- Heaven?

24:07.195 --> 24:08.195
What?

24:08.655 --> 24:10.072
Where you're from.

24:10.699 --> 24:11.991
Heaven?

24:13.452 --> 24:16.745
Hardly. No, I'm from Reading.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.914
Reading is a lot closer to hell.

24:23.044 --> 24:24.670
You like trivia?

24:24.754 --> 24:27.465
- Yes. Why?
- I got a good one, okay?

24:27.549 --> 24:30.634
There is tons of angels in the Bible,
but only four of them have names.

24:30.719 --> 24:33.846
Three of which
are Michael, Raphael and Gabriel.

24:35.557 --> 24:36.599
Who's the fourth?

24:37.809 --> 24:39.643
You're not getting all religious
on me, are you, Jerry?

24:39.728 --> 24:43.189
No, I... This... This is fun.
Come on. Guess.

24:43.231 --> 24:46.066
- Who's the fourth?
- I don't know. Freddy, the angel.

24:46.109 --> 24:48.110
No, not Freddy. You know this.

24:48.195 --> 24:52.072
You know his name, I promise you.
You're forgetting one thing.

24:54.367 --> 24:56.535
You're forgetting that he's an angel.

25:19.267 --> 25:22.603
Jerry, kill me. I wanna die.

25:23.021 --> 25:25.731
Take your knife and cut my throat.

25:25.815 --> 25:28.192
Don't worry, I'll help you.

25:28.276 --> 25:29.276
What?

25:31.071 --> 25:33.739
- No, no, Jerry! No! No!
- I got to do it, I got to do it!

25:36.117 --> 25:37.326
Oh, my God.

25:44.459 --> 25:46.001
The fourth angel is Lucifer.

25:48.463 --> 25:52.091
- What?
- Lucifer is an angel. A fallen angel.

25:55.470 --> 25:57.012
Fiona!

25:58.348 --> 26:00.975
Fiona! He asked me to do it!

26:03.228 --> 26:05.896
Fiona, don't run! You'll get lost!

26:12.195 --> 26:13.404
Fiona!

26:15.991 --> 26:17.074
You okay?

26:20.996 --> 26:22.580
I don't know how that happened,

26:30.463 --> 26:32.214
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.765
You're... You're in pain?

26:42.976 --> 26:43.976
You're suffering.

26:49.357 --> 26:50.691
I love you.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.055
I'm so sorry.

27:21.222 --> 27:24.308
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27:24.392 --> 27:26.352
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27:26.561 --> 27:27.936
I'm sorry.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.158
- Hi, Jer.
- Not now, buddy.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.578
What the hell you been doing?

28:56.818 --> 28:58.527
It's okay, Bosco.

28:58.611 --> 29:00.654
Pretty bad situation, buddy.

29:00.780 --> 29:01.905
I know.

29:03.283 --> 29:07.619
Maybe the best thing to do is just
go to the cops and explain everything.

29:07.662 --> 29:08.871
Just tell them what happened?

29:09.748 --> 29:10.831
Yeah.

29:13.042 --> 29:16.545
I think you're right.
Be good to get it off my chest.

29:17.380 --> 29:20.674
If I wait, it'll be a million times worse.

29:20.717 --> 29:21.759
Thanks, Bosco.

29:21.843 --> 29:24.845
You are both so fucking naive.

29:24.888 --> 29:26.680
You go to the cops and you say,

29:26.765 --> 29:29.683
"Hey, man, I accidentally
stabbed that English chick."

29:31.144 --> 29:34.646
You think they'll all nod and understand
the way your stupid dog does?

29:34.814 --> 29:36.940
- I don't know.
- Well, I do know.

29:37.025 --> 29:39.651
They're gonna throw your ass in jail
where tattooed, meth addicts

29:39.736 --> 29:42.362
will butt-fuck you daily
for 15 years to life.

29:42.405 --> 29:46.950
You're a good man who made a mistake.
Nobody is gonna rape you, Jerry.

29:47.118 --> 29:49.453
- But he did mean to do it.
- No.

29:49.537 --> 29:51.872
Not the deer. That was an accident.

29:51.956 --> 29:54.750
I'm talking about the girl.
You wanted to kill her.

29:54.834 --> 29:57.503
- Never.
- Why'd you take the knife, then?

29:57.545 --> 30:01.089
Oh, my God. I'm evil.

30:01.174 --> 30:03.967
No, you're not.
I've killed things on purpose, Jerry.

30:04.052 --> 30:06.053
There's no shame in it. It's instinct.

30:06.095 --> 30:09.389
The only time I felt truly alive
is when I'm killing.

30:09.432 --> 30:12.226
The only time I've ever felt truly alive.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.187
You see what I mean?

30:15.313 --> 30:18.899
But you have to do something
about the body, Jer.

30:18.942 --> 30:20.192
What about the body?

30:20.235 --> 30:25.364
Well, some hiker stumbles across it,
and pretty soon it's CSI: Milton.

30:25.406 --> 30:30.118
And guess whose hair and fiber
and spit and blood are everywhere?

30:30.245 --> 30:33.622
Yours, Jerry.
Go get rid of the fucking body, dipshit.

30:34.374 --> 30:35.374
I don't know.

30:37.001 --> 30:38.460
I don't know.

30:39.712 --> 30:41.088
I don't know.

32:07.467 --> 32:11.178
- Hey, Jerry. How you doing?
- Hey, Sheriff Weinbacher. I'm good.

32:11.262 --> 32:12.679
Really good.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.681
What happened here?

32:16.684 --> 32:20.354
A deer jumped in the window. It's horrible.

32:21.564 --> 32:23.023
But you're okay?

32:23.066 --> 32:24.191
Yeah.

32:24.442 --> 32:26.922
Well, what did you do with the deer?
That's probably good meat.

32:29.197 --> 32:31.990
I left it on the side of the road.
I shouldn't have done that.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.076
I screwed up. I'm really sorry about that.

32:34.160 --> 32:38.038
No, it was an accident. I'm not gonna
write you up for hunting out of season.

32:39.916 --> 32:42.584
Thank you. Thank you, Sheriff Weinbacher.
I appreciate it.

32:42.752 --> 32:45.462
No problem, Jerry.
You get that window fixed, okay?

32:45.588 --> 32:47.547
Yeah, I'll do it right this afternoon.

32:47.632 --> 32:50.884
- Cool. Drive safely, Jerry.
- You, too.

32:52.762 --> 32:54.054
Hello?

32:55.807 --> 32:58.558
Crap. That's... That's right now, isn't it?

33:00.186 --> 33:01.186
Okay.

33:03.022 --> 33:06.149
Yeah, no, I'm on my way. On my way.

33:15.034 --> 33:16.368
Headaches?

33:17.912 --> 33:20.080
- Trouble sleeping?
- No.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.418
Suicidal impulses?

33:27.714 --> 33:29.089
Do you hear voices?

33:29.173 --> 33:31.842
I hear your voice, now.

33:31.926 --> 33:33.468
Disembodied voices.

33:33.553 --> 33:36.638
Voices that seem to be coming
from somewhere else.

33:36.723 --> 33:37.973
Not really.

33:44.105 --> 33:48.817
Jerry, do you find yourself
crying a lot lately?

33:51.112 --> 33:53.196
- No.
- No?

33:57.744 --> 33:59.703
Are you still taking the medication?

33:59.871 --> 34:00.871
Usually.

34:02.915 --> 34:05.459
You have to take it every day without fail.

34:05.626 --> 34:07.044
I know. I know, but...

34:07.253 --> 34:08.378
But what?

34:11.466 --> 34:14.967
The medication, it smooths things out
and that's okay, right?

34:18.431 --> 34:20.599
But even though there were bad moments...

34:20.641 --> 34:22.976
- Very bad moments.
- Very bad.

34:24.395 --> 34:27.813
There are also moments
of inspiration and beauty

34:27.857 --> 34:30.484
when all the world makes sense,

34:30.525 --> 34:33.737
and the elegant secret mechanics
of man and God are revealed

34:33.821 --> 34:34.987
in their many dimensions,

34:35.072 --> 34:39.284
and the universe is laid out
before mine eyes and it is a blessed place.

34:40.953 --> 34:43.080
You totally stopped taking
the pills, didn't you?

34:43.706 --> 34:46.708
- Totally.
- Thanks for your honesty, Jerry.

34:47.460 --> 34:50.170
Our relationship depends
on the cooperation

34:50.213 --> 34:51.880
of the Department of Corrections.

34:51.964 --> 34:55.217
If you become non-compliant,
I have to report that.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.470
And they'll put me away?

34:58.513 --> 35:02.849
Let's not find out. Let's make you compliant.
Take the pills.

35:02.892 --> 35:05.644
Okay. Okay. Let's not find out.

37:45.972 --> 37:48.098
What's the matter, buddy?

37:49.225 --> 37:52.602
- I really liked her.
- I know you did, buddy.

37:53.229 --> 37:56.314
She's a good kid. I bet you miss her a lot.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.066
Yeah.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.986
I love you guys.

38:16.377 --> 38:18.545
Don't take those pills, Jerry,

38:18.713 --> 38:21.381
unless you wanna say goodbye
to your old friends.

38:21.465 --> 38:24.342
I'm not sure it's a good idea
to be talking to your cat, anyway.

38:24.927 --> 38:26.011
Yeah.

38:26.595 --> 38:27.679
Or dog, either.

38:29.432 --> 38:34.686
Take those drugs and you will enter
a bleak and lonely world, Jerry.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.194
Jerry.

38:44.447 --> 38:45.613
Jerry.

38:47.450 --> 38:48.950
Hi, Fiona.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.702
Look what you did to me.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.912
I'm so sorry.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.249
Friday, I had a pretty cushy gig.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.460
Had lots of friends.
I was the office hottie.

39:00.254 --> 39:03.590
Now I'm a severed head in a fridge.
Sucks to be me, Jerry.

39:04.592 --> 39:06.926
What can I do about it now?

39:06.969 --> 39:09.262
Take the meds, you useless wanker.

39:10.264 --> 39:12.307
Take them. Take them!

39:25.780 --> 39:28.073
See? That wasn't so hard, was it?

39:41.379 --> 39:42.796
Mama!

39:46.300 --> 39:48.301
- Mama!
- Jerry.

39:48.677 --> 39:49.677
Mama!

39:50.096 --> 39:51.638
Where are you?

39:52.515 --> 39:53.640
Jerry.

39:54.934 --> 39:56.810
- Pass him over.
- Come on.

39:56.894 --> 39:58.144
Yeah, pass him over.

39:58.270 --> 39:59.270
Yeah, I got him.

39:59.355 --> 40:00.355
I love you, Jerry.

40:00.481 --> 40:01.940
Bunny Monkey is my friend.

40:02.024 --> 40:06.111
Bunny Monkey is not real.

40:08.906 --> 40:10.156
Mom?

40:10.533 --> 40:11.741
Dad?

40:13.994 --> 40:17.497
You got to learn reality
from fantasy, Jerry.

40:17.748 --> 40:18.748
You got to.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.291
It's a sock.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.544
- Be brave, Jerry.
- I love you, Bunny Monkey.

40:22.628 --> 40:24.045
It's a...

40:24.130 --> 40:25.463
No, don't listen to Mack.

40:25.506 --> 40:28.049
...a fucking...
- Stay with me in my world, Jerry.

40:28.134 --> 40:29.175
...sock!

40:29.218 --> 40:31.344
Sock! Sock! Sock! It's just a sock!

40:32.430 --> 40:34.180
A fucking sock!

40:34.390 --> 40:36.474
I wish you were never born!

40:38.352 --> 40:40.937
You and your mother,
you're fucking psychos!

41:36.243 --> 41:38.036
Bosco? Hey.

41:45.544 --> 41:47.003
Mr. Whiskers.

41:50.090 --> 41:51.591
Say something.

41:52.843 --> 41:55.595
Come on, say something.
Tell me to go "F" myself.

41:58.432 --> 42:00.433
Don't leave me alone, come on.

43:05.874 --> 43:07.125
Tally ho, Jerry.

43:07.334 --> 43:08.835
Fiona, you're back.

43:08.877 --> 43:10.962
Quite. And jolly well high time.

43:11.005 --> 43:13.548
Bloody blooming right,
it's jolly well high time.

43:13.632 --> 43:14.841
You look smashing.

43:14.883 --> 43:18.970
- Those bleeding pills are rubbish.
- I super-hate those pills.

43:19.763 --> 43:22.223
I only took them because you told me to.

43:25.728 --> 43:29.314
Beastly drugs. They made me
look like a sodding jack-o'-lantern.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.440
You know what?

43:32.359 --> 43:35.653
And you were stinky, too.
But now you smell like...

43:35.696 --> 43:39.032
You smell like baby shampoo.
You're beautiful.

43:39.533 --> 43:43.286
Thanks, Jerry.
What a fab, cracking day to come back.

43:43.370 --> 43:48.499
Perfect day. And I'm making
Honeynut Crunchys with 2% milk.

43:48.542 --> 43:49.834
Hip, hip, hooray!

43:54.381 --> 43:56.049
How's the cereal, chummy chum?

43:56.091 --> 43:57.467
Delicious.

43:57.551 --> 43:59.802
Scrummy. God Save the Queen.

44:00.554 --> 44:02.555
Hey, Jerry? Jerry.

44:02.598 --> 44:04.682
Can you get me a friend?

44:05.601 --> 44:06.726
A friend?

44:07.603 --> 44:09.312
I get so lonely in the fridge.

44:14.068 --> 44:16.444
Like... Like kill someone on purpose?

44:16.737 --> 44:18.404
By George, that's it.

44:19.365 --> 44:20.406
Kill someone.

44:21.241 --> 44:24.410
What about Lisa from accounting?

44:24.453 --> 44:26.829
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

44:26.914 --> 44:28.748
Please, Jerry.

44:29.541 --> 44:32.168
Don't be such a nancy-boy about it.

44:32.252 --> 44:33.419
Please?

44:35.422 --> 44:36.923
I don't know.

44:37.633 --> 44:40.051
- I love you, Jerry.
- I love you, too, Fiona.

44:40.135 --> 44:41.427
I love you so much.

44:46.892 --> 44:49.644
- You want some of my Crunchys?
- All right then, guvnor.

45:42.322 --> 45:45.199
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Mr. Kowalski.

45:45.284 --> 45:47.285
I saw you on Friday.

45:48.203 --> 45:51.330
- You saw me?
- Yeah, I saw you. You didn't see me?

45:51.415 --> 45:52.623
No. I didn't see you at all.

45:52.958 --> 45:54.167
You were at Shi Shan.

45:54.209 --> 45:56.502
I saw you in the window,
eating beef chow mein.

45:56.670 --> 46:01.215
At the restaurant.
Yeah, it's my favorite, Shi Shan.

46:01.300 --> 46:02.675
Thank you for seeing me.

46:02.718 --> 46:05.261
I didn't do it on purpose.

46:06.388 --> 46:09.348
No. I mean,
I'm just thankful for seeing each other.

46:10.601 --> 46:13.728
- You okay, Jerry?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

46:13.812 --> 46:16.689
- If you say so. See you, Jerry.
- Okay.

46:16.815 --> 46:19.150
One more thing. Have you seen Fiona?

46:21.069 --> 46:23.404
- Fiona?
- English Fiona. From the party.

46:25.532 --> 46:26.532
No. What's up?

46:26.658 --> 46:29.202
It's the end of the quarter.
We're trying to close out the books

46:29.244 --> 46:31.120
and she's not answering her phone.

46:31.205 --> 46:34.040
Plus, her car is still
in the factory parking lot.

46:36.043 --> 46:38.628
That's sad. She was nice.

46:39.880 --> 46:43.424
Maybe she went back to her own country.
She wouldn't need her car anymore.

46:43.550 --> 46:45.426
I'm gonna miss her a lot.

46:52.559 --> 46:53.726
Jerry.

46:57.564 --> 46:58.731
That's good.

47:01.360 --> 47:02.860
That's very good.

47:08.242 --> 47:10.159
That's even better.

47:17.084 --> 47:21.212
Jerry, change the fucking channel
before I explode.

47:23.090 --> 47:24.882
That's more like it.

47:25.676 --> 47:27.051
I feel so much better.

47:27.261 --> 47:29.971
Jerry is back. Yeah. Fuck those pills.

47:30.097 --> 47:32.431
That headshrinker
doesn't care if you're happy.

47:32.599 --> 47:34.100
She just wants you to be obedient.

47:34.476 --> 47:37.770
- She's not a bad person.
- Not if you want to be a slave to drugs.

47:37.896 --> 47:39.355
Just say no. I do.

47:39.773 --> 47:43.109
Check it out.
Crocodile killed a motherfucking antelope.

47:43.193 --> 47:45.486
- It's a gnu.
- Yes, of course.

47:47.322 --> 47:48.948
Are you gonna kill someone else?

47:49.283 --> 47:51.617
Me? No. Of course not.

47:51.952 --> 47:54.412
Sick, disturbed cat.

47:54.496 --> 47:57.081
Why not, Jer? We both know you want to.

47:57.165 --> 47:59.584
- No.
- You killed by accident, that felt good.

48:00.002 --> 48:03.713
Now do it on purpose, Jerry.
Just once. See what it's like.

48:03.839 --> 48:07.216
Shut up. I don't have to listen to you.
You're just a cat.

48:07.634 --> 48:11.178
Well, a cat that can talk and reason,
that's a miracle for the ages.

48:11.263 --> 48:12.722
So what?

48:12.806 --> 48:14.891
But a guy who talks to his cat...

48:14.975 --> 48:17.018
Well, that's one step away
from the loony bin.

48:17.102 --> 48:19.186
Find someone else. Kill them.

48:19.271 --> 48:23.608
And you'll discover
what it feels like to be truly alive.

48:24.902 --> 48:27.320
- By killing?
- It's better than sex.

48:27.446 --> 48:31.657
He is wrong.
We're not like the pussy, Jerry.

48:31.742 --> 48:33.743
- We have morals.
- That's a good boy.

48:33.827 --> 48:37.121
Did you hear that? I earned
the right to be called a good boy.

48:37.164 --> 48:39.957
You earned the right to
be hit by a minivan.

48:51.845 --> 48:52.845
Knock, knock.

48:52.971 --> 48:54.555
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Lisa.

48:56.224 --> 48:57.642
What's up, big guy?

48:57.684 --> 49:00.978
I was over here.
Just thought I'd see what you're up to.

49:03.440 --> 49:04.440
- Same as always, you know.
- Yeah.

49:04.524 --> 49:08.069
I'm trying to figure out
how to get out of here early.

49:08.153 --> 49:12.031
Early? Shoot, man. It's past 5:00 now.

49:16.161 --> 49:18.037
- Do you wanna get a drink?
- Yeah.

49:20.248 --> 49:21.874
You wanna go to TGI Fridays?

49:21.917 --> 49:24.477
Fridays kind of sucks on Tuesdays.
We could go to David's though.

49:24.544 --> 49:26.837
- It's cool, you'll really like it.
- Good.

49:26.880 --> 49:28.130
- Yeah.
- Okay.

49:30.342 --> 49:31.550
You wanna... Now?

49:32.511 --> 49:33.844
- Yeah, now, just...
- Yeah.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.972
Yeah, if you're ready, I'll...

49:45.399 --> 49:48.567
The divorce was final
in September or something.

49:48.652 --> 49:53.614
I mean, it went like really quickly
because I basically agreed to everything.

49:53.699 --> 49:56.909
You know, he got the house
and the car and I got the cat.

49:57.077 --> 49:58.202
What kind of cat?

50:00.414 --> 50:05.209
I don't know. Like a black and white...
It's a rescue. It's cute.

50:05.252 --> 50:06.627
Are you good with cats?

50:06.712 --> 50:08.713
No, the real question is,
are cats good with me?

50:08.755 --> 50:11.966
Because they pretty much own us,
not the other way around.

50:12.050 --> 50:13.759
Oh, my God, yeah.

50:13.844 --> 50:15.136
- Right?
- You've got that right.

50:15.262 --> 50:18.305
Yeah, I mean, if I don't give my cat
everything he wants,

50:18.390 --> 50:19.640
it's just like, watch out!

50:19.725 --> 50:21.684
Yeah, me too, me too, me too.

50:22.436 --> 50:26.522
Yeah, I tried switching to dry cat food.
He was not having it.

50:26.606 --> 50:28.441
No! He tore up my couch.

50:28.483 --> 50:31.318
- I know. Serves me right, though. I guess.
- They're very demanding.

50:31.403 --> 50:33.487
Yeah! What's your cat's name?

50:34.072 --> 50:37.450
Mr. Whiskers. And he is a son of a bitch.

50:37.576 --> 50:39.452
- How about you?
- Pighead.

50:39.578 --> 50:42.955
'Cause that's what he is. A pig head.

50:44.583 --> 50:45.916
- Pighead.
- He's so cute though.

50:45.959 --> 50:47.460
- Yeah. Yeah!
- Do you wanna meet him?

50:47.502 --> 50:49.962
He probably tearing up
my apartment right now.

50:51.131 --> 50:53.591
- Now?
- Yeah?

50:53.633 --> 50:55.468
Yeah!

50:55.552 --> 50:56.802
Okay.

50:57.679 --> 51:00.890
Yeah, okay. If you're okay to drive.
I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.

51:00.974 --> 51:03.017
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay, I'll be right back.

51:33.673 --> 51:35.633
I'm not

51:35.675 --> 51:40.679
in the habit of going home with somebody
after one date, you know.

51:40.847 --> 51:42.473
But...

51:43.350 --> 51:46.268
Sometimes you just got to say
what the hell, I guess.

51:47.354 --> 51:49.021
Yeah. You just gotta cut loose.

51:50.357 --> 51:52.608
Actually, I'm that way, actually.

51:52.692 --> 51:54.068
Can we go... Can we go somewhere else?

51:54.152 --> 51:55.653
- Where?
- It's a surprise.

52:21.513 --> 52:23.055
Where are we?

52:23.140 --> 52:24.723
This is where I grew up.

52:26.935 --> 52:28.894
It's beautiful.

52:28.937 --> 52:31.063
- You think so?
- Yeah, it's so romantic.

52:31.106 --> 52:33.232
What did you guys grow?

52:33.900 --> 52:35.442
Nothing.

52:35.527 --> 52:39.363
My stepdad had big plans,
but he was gone all the time with the Army.

52:40.866 --> 52:43.868
- And my mom, she pretty much...
- What was she like?

52:45.579 --> 52:47.037
German,

52:48.915 --> 52:50.708
beautiful,

52:51.585 --> 52:52.960
but mostly sad.

52:55.338 --> 52:56.922
Why was she sad?

52:57.883 --> 53:01.594
He made her choose between
leaving him and leaving Berlin.

53:02.804 --> 53:05.055
She spent the rest of her life homesick.

53:06.850 --> 53:08.100
You okay?

53:11.980 --> 53:15.107
That was my favorite window.
I spent a lot of time there.

53:16.860 --> 53:18.611
You didn't have many friends?

53:18.653 --> 53:20.946
Not really.

53:20.989 --> 53:24.450
They called... The kids called me
Gesundheit and Fahrvergnügen

53:24.534 --> 53:26.619
and The Ultimate Crying Machine.

53:27.829 --> 53:29.872
- Kids are cruel.
- I know.

53:32.167 --> 53:36.629
I used to sit there and look up

53:36.713 --> 53:41.217
at the night sky and I'd make believe
that the stars were my friends.

53:42.761 --> 53:44.470
It's stupid.

53:44.512 --> 53:46.013
No, it's sweet.

54:23.343 --> 54:25.177
They're coming for me, Jerry.

54:27.305 --> 54:29.515
I'll stop them.

54:29.557 --> 54:31.308
It's too late.

54:31.351 --> 54:33.477
They already know. I told them.

54:34.145 --> 54:35.646
What did you tell them?

54:37.440 --> 54:42.403
I told them that sometimes I can hear
the secret conversations of the world.

54:43.530 --> 54:45.364
Things no one else hears.

54:47.033 --> 54:51.245
The animals, the angels talking to me.

54:52.914 --> 54:55.749
Sometimes I hear them, too, Mom.

54:56.835 --> 54:59.169
I know you do, Jerry.

55:02.090 --> 55:04.383
Never tell anyone.

55:04.426 --> 55:07.469
I told them and they won't let me alone.

55:07.554 --> 55:10.347
Promise me you'll never tell. Promise.

55:10.390 --> 55:12.808
- I promise.
- Never!

55:12.892 --> 55:14.727
They don't understand.

55:14.811 --> 55:16.729
They can't understand.

55:22.277 --> 55:23.902
What's that sound?

55:28.116 --> 55:30.868
It's the hospital people.

55:30.910 --> 55:32.619
They have the Sheriff with them.

55:34.080 --> 55:35.122
I can't go back.

55:36.082 --> 55:37.541
I can't go back.

55:37.584 --> 55:41.045
I can't go back. I can't go back.

56:01.608 --> 56:02.900
Finish it.

56:04.361 --> 56:07.112
Finish it. Finish it, please.

56:09.491 --> 56:11.909
Jerry, finish it, please.

56:13.370 --> 56:15.329
Please!

56:17.874 --> 56:21.085
Jerry, finish it, please!

56:30.470 --> 56:31.637
Jerry.

56:34.724 --> 56:35.849
What is it?

56:39.938 --> 56:43.148
My mama died up in that room.

56:50.490 --> 56:52.616
- Sorry, I'm sorry.
- No, don't be. Hey.

56:55.662 --> 56:56.912
It's okay.

57:02.794 --> 57:06.797
It's just... I'm so sad.

57:32.365 --> 57:33.699
Take me home, will ya?

58:32.300 --> 58:33.926
- Hey.
- Thanks.

58:38.097 --> 58:40.432
That was a wonderful night, Jerry.

58:41.309 --> 58:42.726
I think so, too.

58:45.522 --> 58:47.397
I'm really glad you asked me out.

58:48.316 --> 58:49.775
Me too.

58:50.485 --> 58:52.319
You're so mysterious, you know.

58:54.781 --> 58:56.114
The first time you came up to accounting,

58:56.157 --> 58:58.075
I could tell there was something
deep about you.

59:03.915 --> 59:06.959
You seem a million miles away.
What's on your mind?

59:08.378 --> 59:11.630
This night turned out differently
than I was expecting.

59:14.384 --> 59:15.676
Different, good?

59:15.802 --> 59:16.927
Definitely.

59:18.304 --> 59:19.972
I don't feel alone.

59:20.056 --> 59:21.515
Me neither.

59:24.269 --> 59:25.602
We have to get going.

59:27.981 --> 59:30.190
- Work!
- Yeah.

59:30.275 --> 59:32.150
I know. It seems like the last thing
I wanna think about.

59:32.193 --> 59:34.903
I know. I gotta go home
and feed my cat and dog.

59:34.988 --> 59:36.280
- They're gonna be furious with me.
- Yes!

59:36.322 --> 59:38.782
- Do you want me to give you a ride?
- No, no, no, it's okay. I'll walk.

59:38.908 --> 59:40.951
- Yeah?
- Yeah! Come up to accounting later,

59:41.035 --> 59:43.995
just pretend you're delivering something.
We can make out in the copy room.

59:44.038 --> 59:45.330
- I'll try.
- Okay.

59:46.165 --> 59:47.833
- Bye.
- Bye.

59:49.836 --> 59:51.420
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:00:11.232 --> 01:00:13.150
Who is a good boy?

01:00:13.192 --> 01:00:15.352
- Who is a good boy?
- I want to smell her crotch, Jer.

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:16.528
Come, here. Hey, sit!

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.197
Where the fuck's my food, fuck-face?

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:22.701
That was the best night in my whole life.

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:25.746
Who's a good boy? Yeah.

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:30.876
Food!

01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:33.879
- Hey, Mr. Whiskers.
- Food!

01:00:34.088 --> 01:00:35.589
Now!

01:00:37.175 --> 01:00:39.718
I left you a little gift on the sofa.

01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:42.554
A reminder why you can't
leave us alone without food.

01:00:55.693 --> 01:00:58.654
Jerry, hey.

01:00:58.738 --> 01:01:00.572
Get me a friend!

01:01:00.615 --> 01:01:03.241
- What's the matter, buddy?
- What am I supposed to do?

01:01:03.284 --> 01:01:05.535
- I do not know.
- Same as always.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.455
- Pretend everything is fine.
- Really?

01:01:08.539 --> 01:01:10.499
It got you this far, didn't it?

01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:11.917
I guess so.

01:01:36.484 --> 01:01:38.110
- Hey, Jerry?
- What?

01:01:38.319 --> 01:01:41.321
They need you up in accounting.
Some problem with payroll or something.

01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:42.531
Okay.

01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:50.455
I found some irregularities in your records.
We need to do an audit.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.832
- What?
- Come on!

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.294
- Close the door!
- Close the door.

01:01:58.089 --> 01:01:59.631
Come here.

01:02:06.931 --> 01:02:09.850
Thanks, Jerry. Jerry was just...

01:02:09.934 --> 01:02:12.310
Just faxed... Fixed the copier.

01:02:12.353 --> 01:02:13.854
I can make a copy later.

01:02:13.938 --> 01:02:16.231
- I gotta go. I'm gonna go. Okay.
- Okay.

01:02:23.948 --> 01:02:25.449
Lisa, you dog.

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:28.994
Hey, are you still doing payroll?

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:31.329
Yeah, I'm a payroll lifer, why?

01:02:31.372 --> 01:02:34.875
Can you give me Jerry's address?
I wanna bring him a gift or something.

01:02:34.959 --> 01:02:36.501
Like a whoopie cake. It's nothing.

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:38.587
Or you could just ask him.

01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:41.548
I want it to be a surprise.

01:02:41.632 --> 01:02:42.883
Please?

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:49.931
That's a lot of cheese sandwiches
to eat in one sitting! Forty one!

01:02:50.016 --> 01:02:52.726
And that tiny Sonya Thomas always wins!

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:54.436
And now a grimmer story.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:58.356
A woman murdered.
Her partial remains dumped in the woods!

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.525
- So sad!
- So terrible!

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:04.154
Reporter Sheila Hammer
has an Action One News exclusive.

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:05.989
The grisly discovery Tuesday,

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:09.367
near Milton, of an unidentified
female stabbing victim,

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:12.412
has local police on the hunt
for a serial killer.

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:14.289
- Jerry, you're a serial killer!
- Sheriff Weinbacher.

01:03:14.373 --> 01:03:15.540
No, he isn't.

01:03:15.666 --> 01:03:17.375
Now with the aid of the FBI,
we have developed

01:03:17.418 --> 01:03:19.920
a profile of the unknown killer.

01:03:20.004 --> 01:03:22.839
Male, late 20s or early 30s,

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:25.592
white, lower or middle class.
Trouble fitting in.

01:03:25.676 --> 01:03:28.720
That's you, Jerry. Can I have an autograph?

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:31.056
Will he kill again?

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:34.226
Well, if he's not stopped soon,
every indication is

01:03:34.268 --> 01:03:35.894
he will kill again.

01:03:36.729 --> 01:03:38.313
You hear that, punk?

01:03:38.397 --> 01:03:40.440
- No! No! No, no.
- You're a killer.

01:03:40.566 --> 01:03:42.025
- God.
- A serial killer!

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:45.946
- I don't wanna be a killer.
- Too late, shitbag. There's no turning back.

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:49.032
You're a stone-cold murdering maniac.

01:03:53.454 --> 01:03:55.831
- Told you so.
- Told me so what?

01:03:55.915 --> 01:04:00.168
I told you you like killing.
And now the cops, they say the same thing.

01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:01.586
Jerry!

01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:06.091
Jerry!

01:04:09.595 --> 01:04:10.846
Jerry!

01:04:12.765 --> 01:04:15.183
- What they saying about you, love?
- That I'm a killer.

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:16.560
Take me out.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.604
Let's talk about it.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.022
What if I am?

01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:24.401
- Serial killer?
- Yeah!

01:04:24.443 --> 01:04:26.528
Well, is it something that you are?

01:04:26.612 --> 01:04:29.114
Like being brown-eyed or right-handed.

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:33.827
Or is it something that you choose?
Like being an accountant.

01:04:33.911 --> 01:04:36.705
- I wish I knew.
- You can still make the choice, Jerry.

01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:37.873
You're still a good man.

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:41.126
I try to be a good man.
I wanna be a good man.

01:04:41.168 --> 01:04:44.129
- Then there's the cat...
- Fuck you, blaming it on me.

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:47.966
Hold on a second!
Look, I know what is good.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:50.552
I know. I wanna lead
a righteous and just life.

01:04:50.636 --> 01:04:52.556
I wanna be an upstanding member
of the community.

01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:56.224
But, you know, Mr. Whiskers,
he makes me do bad things.

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:59.019
The cat was nowhere near
when you killed me, Jerry.

01:04:59.145 --> 01:05:01.479
See? See? Thank you, lady-head.

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:03.106
Okay. First of all, not true.

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:07.068
Second of all,
I know right from wrong, okay?

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:09.821
I know it. I try to be good.

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:11.448
But then certain

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:17.954
horrible things happened
and I am filled with...

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:21.416
With terror and dread,
standing outside of myself.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:26.171
Even though I know what I've done,
I also feel like...

01:05:27.965 --> 01:05:29.090
Like it wasn't me.

01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:32.802
Pretty complicated inside the human mind.

01:05:32.845 --> 01:05:36.264
It was you that killed me, Jerry. You.

01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:39.684
Okay, that's true, but in a certain sense,
it wasn't me.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.061
It was...

01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:44.606
- You gonna say it was me?
- No, I wasn't gonna say that.

01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:46.441
All right. Devil's advo-cat.

01:05:46.525 --> 01:05:51.613
Let's say it was me, but you know that
I'm a talking cat. There's no such thing.

01:05:51.697 --> 01:05:55.033
Everything I say is really you.

01:05:55.076 --> 01:05:57.619
- It's true, buddy. It's all you.
- What?

01:05:57.703 --> 01:05:59.913
Come on, Jer. You know that.

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:02.123
Your pets are spot-on, Jerry.

01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:06.211
I kind of suspected that.

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:10.423
But if there's me,

01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:14.719
you know, regular me, standing here,
the me who is talking now,

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:18.556
and I wanna be good.

01:06:18.599 --> 01:06:20.934
Then there's you, you and you,

01:06:21.018 --> 01:06:23.770
trying to make me be something else.

01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:26.856
- Am I good?
- No.

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.193
- You're bad.
- She's wrong. You're a good boy.

01:06:30.277 --> 01:06:32.904
They're both wrong. You are what you are.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.364
That's it.

01:06:35.741 --> 01:06:37.659
I am...

01:06:40.579 --> 01:06:42.789
- Someone's here! Intruder! Intruder!
- Bosco, Bosco!

01:06:42.873 --> 01:06:46.001
I got your back, Jerry!
I got your back, Jerry!
I got your back, Jerry!

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:47.168
Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay! Stay!

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:50.171
Just a second!
Just trying to put my dog away!

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:52.632
Hey, Jerry, is that my new friend?

01:06:53.926 --> 01:06:55.802
Jerry, I just need a whiff of her butt.

01:06:56.929 --> 01:06:57.929
Jerry!

01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:00.682
Jerry!

01:07:03.894 --> 01:07:05.812
- Hey, Lisa.
- Hi, Jerry.

01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:12.444
- Surprise, sorry.
- No, I'm so glad that you came.

01:07:12.486 --> 01:07:14.404
No, no. I'm imposing. I can tell.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:16.364
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you!

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.908
I brought you some cakes.

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:22.287
You're amazing. Thank you for this.

01:07:23.122 --> 01:07:24.956
There's four of them.

01:07:26.792 --> 01:07:30.295
Sorry, if... Do you have company?
Or am I interrupting?

01:07:30.337 --> 01:07:32.589
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Wait. Yeah, I...

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:36.843
It's just that... What you heard is
that I sometimes... I talk to my pets.

01:07:38.637 --> 01:07:40.346
- A lot of the time.
- No, me too.

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:43.391
All the time. And they sometimes talk to me.
Sometimes.

01:07:44.769 --> 01:07:46.144
I get that.

01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:49.314
- Thank you for the cake.
- Are you locked out?

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:51.316
It's okay.

01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:56.029
I'll figure out how to get in somehow.
You don't need to stay around.

01:07:57.323 --> 01:08:00.950
And how are you gonna get in?

01:08:00.993 --> 01:08:02.660
There's a skylight.

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:04.662
I can totally get in through the skylight.

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:05.997
Really?

01:08:06.832 --> 01:08:09.501
You know, I'm pretty good
at getting in places.

01:08:09.543 --> 01:08:12.587
- I lose my keys all the time, so...
- I'm gonna use the skylight.

01:08:28.895 --> 01:08:30.814
Jerry, you okay?

01:08:30.856 --> 01:08:32.482
I'm fine.

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:34.359
- How are you?
- Fine!

01:08:35.027 --> 01:08:37.237
Jerry, I'm...

01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:39.823
Jerry, I'm gonna just... Okay.

01:08:39.865 --> 01:08:43.033
Okay! Bye, Lisa! Thanks for stopping by!

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:53.837
Jerry! I got it open!

01:08:57.091 --> 01:08:59.050
Hey! Hey, buddy.

01:09:01.386 --> 01:09:03.513
Hey, Jerry! Jerry!

01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:07.267
Come on. Come on. No. No, no, no.
I don't wanna play. Come on.

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:12.856
Come on, come on, come on. Come on.
Okay, good boy, good boy.

01:10:19.924 --> 01:10:21.257
Lisa.

01:10:21.508 --> 01:10:23.259
I told you I was gonna go
through the skylight!

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:25.803
- Jerry, I'm sorry.
- Why would you...

01:10:25.846 --> 01:10:27.055
I apologize.

01:10:27.139 --> 01:10:29.807
...go through the door like that?
- I'm sorry, it's my fault.

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:31.601
- I'm just gonna go home.
- No, no, no, no.

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:33.978
Please. Please, please, please stay.
It's okay, okay...

01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:37.315
She's the best thing
that ever happened to me!

01:10:38.943 --> 01:10:41.277
- She's the best.
- Jerry, who are you talking to?

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.738
No, no. Wait, wait.

01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:48.159
No! No, no, no, no.

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:50.567
- Jerry, I'm just gonna go.
- No, I'm not gonna hurt her.

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:51.996
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:10:52.164 --> 01:10:54.332
No, no, I'm not gonna hurt you, it's fine.
That's fine.

01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:56.542
It's...

01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:58.795
- They're gonna hate me.
- No.

01:10:58.837 --> 01:11:00.713
No, no. Lisa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:11:02.967 --> 01:11:06.177
Lisa! Hey! Lisa? Please!

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:11.516
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay?

01:11:14.353 --> 01:11:16.187
Please, open the door!

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:19.190
No!

01:11:19.733 --> 01:11:22.443
No! Lisa, come on.

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:35.623
Lisa.

01:11:53.058 --> 01:11:54.267
Lisa?

01:12:02.776 --> 01:12:04.402
I'm gonna come in now, okay?

01:12:16.915 --> 01:12:19.208
I'm so, so sorry.

01:12:19.918 --> 01:12:21.919
Jerry, I won't tell anyone.

01:12:21.962 --> 01:12:24.881
I wish that you didn't have to see that.

01:12:24.923 --> 01:12:27.925
I just wish that we could
go back to the beginning, you know.

01:12:28.052 --> 01:12:29.260
We can.

01:12:31.096 --> 01:12:32.263
We can.

01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:36.267
I'm really sorry.

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:40.396
- No, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry I got scared earlier.

01:12:40.481 --> 01:12:43.274
I know. That was scary. I...

01:12:43.317 --> 01:12:44.942
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:46.277
It's okay.

01:12:54.453 --> 01:12:55.703
I'm fine now.

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:57.789
I know, I know. I know.

01:12:59.666 --> 01:13:01.084
And you hit me so hard.

01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:03.836
It's okay.

01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:19.769
Are you okay?

01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:21.896
Oh, God. I don't know how that happened.

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:26.150
- I'm so sorry.
- Jerry.

01:13:29.488 --> 01:13:31.322
I wanna go home.

01:13:34.868 --> 01:13:35.993
Jerry.

01:13:44.503 --> 01:13:48.047
It's okay. It's okay.
I know you are suffering.

01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:49.841
I'm gonna help you.

01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:29.046
Hey, you did what you had to do, Jerry.

01:14:30.174 --> 01:14:32.550
Figure it out in the morning.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:39.390
It's okay, buddy. Everything...

01:14:41.935 --> 01:14:44.395
Everything's gonna be okay.
You're a good boy.

01:14:52.404 --> 01:14:53.404
What?

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:57.533
You want a piece?

01:14:58.076 --> 01:14:59.076
What?

01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:02.580
What? Want some of this?

01:15:12.132 --> 01:15:13.424
What?

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:25.102
Our Father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.

01:15:25.145 --> 01:15:27.665
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.

01:15:27.731 --> 01:15:30.358
Make Jerry and Mr. Whiskers
and Bosco good boys. Amen.

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:35.530
Hey, Lisa, sweetie,

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:38.449
maybe give me a call
or a text when you get this.

01:15:38.492 --> 01:15:40.034
Hope you're okay.

01:15:40.118 --> 01:15:41.369
I can't reach her either.

01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:44.997
Are you guys watching the video
of the baby peeing on the senator?

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:48.292
No email, no Facebook updates.

01:15:48.335 --> 01:15:51.170
She was going out with that Jerry guy
from Packing and Shipping.

01:15:51.255 --> 01:15:52.964
I can't reach him, either.

01:15:53.006 --> 01:15:55.383
Jerry, the pizza guy? God, he's weird.

01:15:55.467 --> 01:15:57.677
- You heard the rumors, right?
- No.

01:15:57.761 --> 01:16:00.263
Go to the Tri-State Herald website.

01:16:02.307 --> 01:16:05.851
July 9th, 1997. Front page.

01:16:58.155 --> 01:17:00.406
Intruder! Intruder!

01:17:00.532 --> 01:17:03.492
I'll take your bullet for you, Jerry.
I'll take your bullet for you, Jerry.

01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:08.331
Don't pee yourself,
it's not the dog catcher. Unfortunately.

01:17:10.375 --> 01:17:11.417
What do we do?

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.211
Jerry, I got an idea.

01:17:21.762 --> 01:17:23.095
Hi, Jerry.

01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:25.431
Hi, Alison.

01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:42.531
- Hey, Jerry?
- Yeah?

01:17:42.574 --> 01:17:43.824
You remember last week

01:17:43.909 --> 01:17:48.245
when you said there was an invisible line
that separates good from evil,

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:49.330
and you thought you'd crossed it.

01:17:49.414 --> 01:17:51.454
And I said,
"No, no, no, no, no! You're a good boy!"

01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:54.335
- Yeah, I remember. So what?
- I've changed my opinion.

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.255
So you think I'm evil, Bosco?

01:17:58.423 --> 01:17:59.757
I'm certain of it.

01:18:04.012 --> 01:18:06.138
Welcome to my world, Jerry!

01:18:06.223 --> 01:18:08.265
I don't wanna be a part of your world.

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:11.852
You're already there.
Become what you're meant to become.

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:14.563
Fiona?

01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:16.899
What do you think I should do?

01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:22.780
Well, you can't go back to work,
can't stay here, either.

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:27.910
I think it's time to see
if the cat knows what he's talking about.

01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:29.161
She's right.

01:18:29.246 --> 01:18:32.623
- I totally agree.
- Well, meow to that.

01:18:32.666 --> 01:18:35.209
Just go around killing people?
I like people.

01:18:35.293 --> 01:18:38.087
Aye. Fuck the dog.

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:40.256
Do it for the pleasure it brings.

01:18:40.298 --> 01:18:42.174
Come on, Jerry.

01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:43.926
We'll get a bigger fridge.

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:46.929
- The first five are always the hardest.
- Don't listen to him, Jerry.

01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:50.433
I don't know about you girls,
but that Jerry guy, he's going crazy.

01:18:50.517 --> 01:18:53.477
- He's losing it.
- He convinces himself it's all fine.

01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:56.480
Come on now. You can do it.

01:18:56.648 --> 01:18:58.065
I will vomit in my own mouth.

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:01.067
...pretend you've been
taking care of Jerry. - Yes.

01:19:01.278 --> 01:19:02.653
I'm so bloody...

01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:05.197
- Of course.
- He's so sexy when he's dark.

01:19:05.323 --> 01:19:06.657
Who can tell he's crazy
just by looking at him?

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:07.867
This whole situation is kind of...

01:19:07.951 --> 01:19:09.351
- Stupid fridge!
- It smells like...

01:19:09.369 --> 01:19:10.369
You da man.

01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:12.496
All these stupid talking heads...

01:19:12.664 --> 01:19:15.833
Shut up!

01:19:28.805 --> 01:19:29.889
Hi.

01:19:30.682 --> 01:19:31.974
Jerry!

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:36.687
I got a lot going on right now.

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:38.939
What happened?

01:19:39.024 --> 01:19:42.276
Well, I've been crying a lot.

01:19:43.153 --> 01:19:46.572
All the time.
And I stopped taking the drugs.

01:19:46.656 --> 01:19:48.240
What? Why?

01:19:49.242 --> 01:19:50.701
The cat made me do it.

01:19:51.328 --> 01:19:53.746
Your cat made you?

01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:56.165
No, no, kind of.

01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:59.084
I mean, Mr. Whiskers does the talking,
but it's really me.

01:20:00.045 --> 01:20:01.545
See? I'm making progress.

01:20:01.713 --> 01:20:03.506
It's not the cat! I know that now.

01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:05.966
Jerry, we had an agreement.

01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:07.426
I know. I'm sorry.

01:20:08.512 --> 01:20:11.347
Dr. Warren! I'm a bad person.

01:20:11.389 --> 01:20:13.432
Don't be so hard on yourself.

01:20:14.392 --> 01:20:16.644
I appreciate your honesty.

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:22.900
I'm disappointed, but hey,
it's not like you killed someone.

01:20:25.946 --> 01:20:27.947
What, Jerry?

01:20:28.031 --> 01:20:29.865
It is kind of like that.

01:20:31.076 --> 01:20:33.285
Kind of like that times three.

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.290
What are you saying, Jerry?

01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:42.920
Three people who aren't alive anymore
because of me.

01:20:43.755 --> 01:20:46.173
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. I know.

01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:49.301
I feel terrible about it.

01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:53.055
And I really need your help right now.

01:20:53.098 --> 01:20:55.432
- I'll help you, Jerry.
- Thank you.

01:20:55.475 --> 01:20:57.518
Go ahead. I'm listening.

01:21:00.397 --> 01:21:02.898
Okay. You know the conga line?

01:21:04.359 --> 01:21:07.403
- At your company party. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:21:09.739 --> 01:21:12.408
Everybody sang A Happy Song.

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:17.162
And you know that English girl, Fiona,
we conga-ed

01:21:17.247 --> 01:21:19.331
and we were supposed to go to Shi Shan,

01:21:19.416 --> 01:21:21.292
see an awesome show and...

01:21:22.794 --> 01:21:24.795
What are you doing, Doctor Warren?
Give me that.

01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:26.672
- No!
- Sorry, wrong number!

01:21:26.756 --> 01:21:28.966
- Help me! I'm being held hostage.
- It was an accident!

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:31.635
I liked all of them
and wish they were all alive.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.304
But there's nothing
that I can do about that now.

01:21:33.346 --> 01:21:34.847
Wait, do you have packing tape?

01:21:34.931 --> 01:21:37.349
- What? Why?
- Because I can't let you go.

01:21:37.434 --> 01:21:39.435
And I still need a lot of therapy.

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:44.899
No! Stay there! You stay there now!
Back! Back!

01:21:44.983 --> 01:21:48.235
Jerry, you're really upset right now.
Let's discuss this.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.821
- Okay.
- Stay calm. I understand.

01:21:50.864 --> 01:21:53.824
Jerry, don't do this.
Don't do this, Jerry. No.

01:22:05.879 --> 01:22:09.465
Okay. We haven't got a lot of time,
so we gotta get into the big issues.

01:22:10.008 --> 01:22:11.050
Do you believe in God?

01:22:12.385 --> 01:22:15.012
Me too. But I totally think
that he has it out for me.

01:22:15.138 --> 01:22:17.473
He cuts everyone else slack
and then totally craps all over me,

01:22:17.515 --> 01:22:19.850
and I wanna know why.

01:22:19.893 --> 01:22:22.853
Why would he put a little boy
in a home with a father like that?

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:26.098
Make my mother lose herself so completely
that she'd rather die than be with me?

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:32.112
But if he is all-knowing,
God must be okay with me killing people.

01:22:33.698 --> 01:22:35.366
A shrink who wants to talk.

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:40.704
Good, if I un-tape you, we're going get on
the fast road to mental health, okay?

01:22:40.747 --> 01:22:44.458
Hey, you start doing the silent shrink
thing and I can't predict what I'll do.

01:22:47.462 --> 01:22:49.296
Now, why do I hear voices?

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:54.885
A lot of people hear voices.

01:22:54.928 --> 01:22:57.680
Or thoughts they can't stop.

01:22:58.223 --> 01:23:00.015
- A lot of people?
- Yeah.

01:23:00.767 --> 01:23:05.396
It might be a voice telling them
they're worthless or stupid.

01:23:05.438 --> 01:23:09.441
Or it could tell them to
indulge every desire.

01:23:09.526 --> 01:23:12.778
"Drink that drink." "Take that drug."
"Follow every sexual impulse."

01:23:12.904 --> 01:23:16.407
Or it could be a cynical voice
telling them nothing matters,

01:23:16.449 --> 01:23:18.617
that their efforts are insignificant.

01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:20.244
You hear stuff like that?

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:23.580
Yeah. I have thoughts.

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:27.793
Not exactly the same as you, but similar.

01:23:27.877 --> 01:23:29.878
They tell me that I'm fat,

01:23:29.921 --> 01:23:34.425
or psychotherapy is not
a worthwhile exercise.

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:36.051
That it's not real.

01:23:36.094 --> 01:23:39.179
That I should have aimed higher
than a government job,

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:41.849
that my potential is being squandered,

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.601
that I'm unworthy of love.

01:23:45.937 --> 01:23:49.440
But none of that is true.
So what do you do about it?

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:54.778
Well, I can't shut them off entirely,

01:23:54.821 --> 01:23:59.116
nor would I want to,
but I can argue against them.

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:02.786
Just because you have thoughts,
doesn't mean you have to act on them.

01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:07.791
You don't have to act on them?

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:10.210
No!

01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:16.300
Being alone in the world
is the root of all suffering.

01:24:17.177 --> 01:24:20.679
But, Jerry, you are not alone.

01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:35.277
See, that's like 10 years of therapy
in 10 seconds.

01:24:41.159 --> 01:24:43.243
Where are we going?

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:45.662
Home. I gotta feed my pets.

01:25:04.182 --> 01:25:05.307
All right, let's go.

01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:08.727
No, no, no. You go inside,
I'll wait here and watch the road.

01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:14.191
So that if I see him coming,
I can honk the horn

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:16.693
and warn you,
and then you can run back immediately.

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:18.779
You're a real hero, John.

01:25:36.714 --> 01:25:38.173
Alison!

01:26:29.642 --> 01:26:32.144
John, call the police. Call the...

01:26:51.664 --> 01:26:53.123
Mr. Whiskers.

01:26:54.125 --> 01:26:55.417
Bosco.

01:26:56.628 --> 01:26:59.296
- Oh, my God, Jerry. What've you done?
- Please be quiet.

01:26:59.464 --> 01:27:02.507
- Please be quiet.
- Let me go, for God's sake!

01:27:02.592 --> 01:27:04.635
- Mr. Whiskers?
- What are you gonna do?

01:27:04.677 --> 01:27:06.470
I told you, I don't know already.
All right?

01:27:06.554 --> 01:27:07.971
Bosco!

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:09.598
What are you gonna do?

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:12.768
- What are you going to do?
- I told you, I don't know.

01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:14.436
My pets are missing.

01:27:20.777 --> 01:27:23.320
Jerry, let me go, for God's sake!

01:27:25.531 --> 01:27:27.324
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:27:47.971 --> 01:27:49.346
Mr. Whiskers!

01:27:50.848 --> 01:27:52.182
Bosco!

01:27:53.851 --> 01:27:55.435
Bosco!

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:03.860
Hey, loser. Is this the bitch
you've been fucking?

01:28:04.195 --> 01:28:08.824
No! No! No! Mr. Whiskers.
That is my psychotherapist.

01:28:08.866 --> 01:28:11.952
Great job she's doing.
You're the picture of mental health.

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.246
- Where's Bosco?
- He got hit by a minivan.

01:28:14.372 --> 01:28:16.206
- I'm lost without him.
- Good.

01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:18.917
Now you can kill her
without all his pathetic yelping.

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:25.924
No, no, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna just do this.

01:28:26.217 --> 01:28:27.509
Oh, God.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:30.095
- Jerry?
- Yeah.

01:28:31.222 --> 01:28:32.306
I'm scared.

01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:33.598
She wasn't scared last week

01:28:33.683 --> 01:28:36.351
when she threatened
to send you back to the loony bin.

01:28:36.394 --> 01:28:37.602
Me too.

01:28:40.231 --> 01:28:43.108
What can I do to make you
more comfortable?

01:28:43.192 --> 01:28:45.819
- I want to make a phone call.
- She'll call the cops.

01:28:45.903 --> 01:28:47.070
You'll call the cops.

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:50.907
No, no, no! I just don't wanna be alone.

01:28:54.746 --> 01:28:57.914
Stay right there. Hold on.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:28:59.751 --> 01:29:01.418
You don't have to be alone.

01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:04.004
Here, here, here.

01:29:09.761 --> 01:29:13.430
Mr. Whiskers! Dr. Warren!
Fiona! Cut it out!

01:29:16.142 --> 01:29:17.642
Mr. Whiskers!

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.125
Hey.

01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:47.255
You did the best that you could.
It's not your fault.

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:50.967
What are you gonna do to me?

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:54.054
Nothing. Nothing.

01:29:54.138 --> 01:29:55.389
It's fine.

01:30:04.357 --> 01:30:07.984
Put me the fuck down,
you goddamn psycho. I'll shit in your hand.

01:30:10.655 --> 01:30:11.988
The suspect's car is in the parking lot.

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:14.032
- Here. Here.
- I want you two on the right.

01:30:14.117 --> 01:30:16.317
Fan out and spread around the building.
Cover all exits.

01:30:16.327 --> 01:30:17.786
All right, keep low, guys.

01:30:19.622 --> 01:30:21.415
Round the back, round the back.

01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:38.682
Is this your brilliant escape plan, Jerry?

01:30:39.725 --> 01:30:42.519
Sneak out the back door.
It's your favorite door, isn't it?

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:44.146
It's the best I've got.

01:30:51.028 --> 01:30:55.323
That's good, Jerry. This will fool them,
since you are bulletproof and invisible.

01:30:57.452 --> 01:30:58.785
Run, Jerry.

01:30:59.579 --> 01:31:01.455
It's been nice knowing you, pal.

01:31:20.057 --> 01:31:21.417
- Sheriff's department.
- I'm here!

01:31:21.434 --> 01:31:23.101
- Nobody move.
- Don't hurt me!

01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:25.729
I smell gas.

01:31:27.023 --> 01:31:28.607
Can't you smell that?

01:31:28.941 --> 01:31:30.108
We'll check on it.

01:31:30.193 --> 01:31:32.194
- Where did Jerry go?
- He went in there.

01:31:32.236 --> 01:31:34.404
Suspect last seen in the bathroom.

01:31:35.448 --> 01:31:36.907
- Was he armed?
- I don't know.

01:31:39.869 --> 01:31:41.495
I found a cat.

01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:57.719
Jerry.

01:32:01.432 --> 01:32:03.099
Hey, we found a cat and a dog.

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:05.227
- Call the animal shelter.
- Are you okay?

01:32:06.771 --> 01:32:09.091
We believe he's in the bowling alley.
You think he's armed?

01:32:09.106 --> 01:32:10.273
I don't know.

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:12.108
Then we have to assume he is.

01:32:12.276 --> 01:32:15.278
Please don't hurt him. He's very ill.

01:32:15.404 --> 01:32:18.490
Our first priority is
our own safety, Doctor.

01:32:23.621 --> 01:32:25.455
Tactical team on scene.

01:32:26.290 --> 01:32:28.542
First responders, clear.

01:32:28.626 --> 01:32:30.210
Bedroom, clear.

01:32:37.051 --> 01:32:38.260
Go! Go!

01:32:38.469 --> 01:32:40.262
Preparing to descend.

01:32:43.307 --> 01:32:44.558
Gas leak!

01:32:51.232 --> 01:32:52.774
Jerry.

01:32:52.942 --> 01:32:54.651
Jerry.

01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:57.487
Jerry, you're almost home.

01:32:57.572 --> 01:33:00.115
Come home, Jerry.

01:33:00.157 --> 01:33:01.658
Come. Come with us.

01:33:03.119 --> 01:33:04.661
Come, Jerry.

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.706
We are all waiting for you.

01:33:07.957 --> 01:33:11.126
Come. You will never be alone anymore.

01:33:11.168 --> 01:33:15.505
Come home, come.
You will never be alone again.

01:33:16.215 --> 01:33:18.049
Jerry, come.

01:33:18.384 --> 01:33:19.509
We're waiting for you.

01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:21.052
Jerry.

01:33:35.568 --> 01:33:39.779
Well done. As in, you're going to be
char-broiled, Jerry. You run.

01:33:39.864 --> 01:33:42.824
No! You stay.

01:33:42.867 --> 01:33:45.493
You're no good to yourself or anybody else.

01:33:45.536 --> 01:33:47.370
You let the fire put you to sleep.

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:51.416
"Put you to sleep." Isn't that what
they say right before they kill you?

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:52.751
Jerry knows that.

01:33:52.835 --> 01:33:54.961
He can end the suffering tonight.

01:33:55.046 --> 01:33:58.673
Unless you want to be
Jerry the Human Torch, get the hell out!

01:33:58.716 --> 01:34:01.176
Stand your ground, buddy!

01:34:01.218 --> 01:34:03.470
There's nothing left for you in this life.

01:34:19.028 --> 01:34:22.739
We could have filled
10 more refrigerators, Jerry.

01:34:22.782 --> 01:34:24.282
Shush, pussy.

01:34:24.367 --> 01:34:28.244
If he survives he'll only cause
more suffering, pain and death.

01:34:29.121 --> 01:34:32.290
It's over. Jerry's going home.

01:34:48.224 --> 01:34:49.599
You win, pup.

01:34:50.643 --> 01:34:53.311
I have to confess,
this alpha thing suits you well.

01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:56.981
I kind of like you, Bosco.

01:34:57.900 --> 01:34:59.734
Me, too.

01:34:59.777 --> 01:35:01.444
I like you, Mr. Whiskers.

01:35:02.947 --> 01:35:06.157
But now, it's time for each of us
to go our own way.

01:35:07.451 --> 01:35:10.286
- Goodbye, friend.
- Goodbye, Mr. Whiskers.

01:35:23.342 --> 01:35:24.968
- Mom?
- Hey, Jerry.

01:35:25.052 --> 01:35:26.386
- Dad?
- Creep.

01:35:27.930 --> 01:35:30.014
Hey, Fiona! Lisa!

01:35:30.099 --> 01:35:31.975
- Good evening, love!
- Hi, Jerry!

01:35:33.936 --> 01:35:36.354
- Alison?
- Hey, Jerry!

01:35:36.439 --> 01:35:38.732
I'm sorry I killed you guys!

01:35:38.816 --> 01:35:41.526
Let's not bring up the bad things.
Let's just be happy.

01:35:48.743 --> 01:35:51.202
- Jesus!
- Hi, Jerry.

01:35:51.287 --> 01:35:53.496
Thanks for the love
and thank you for coming.

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:55.165
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

01:35:55.332 --> 01:35:58.168
- Are my pets going to be okay?
- You betcha!
