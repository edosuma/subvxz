00:48.342 --> 00:49.943
Give report!

00:50.011 --> 00:52.812
Spartacus' cavalry
has broken our western flank.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.547
That fucking savage.

00:54.615 --> 00:57.450
Give signal to re-form
to the south.

01:56.561 --> 01:58.947
Kill him!

03:12.000 --> 03:13.267
We must go!

03:50.006 --> 03:51.406
Spartacus!

03:51.474 --> 03:53.741
The Romans have sounded retreat.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.552
We have won the day.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.721
We have won nothing.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.624
Cossinius and Furius
again slip from grasp.

04:09.692 --> 04:10.892
The same cannot be said

04:10.960 --> 04:13.262
for many that stood with them.

04:13.329 --> 04:16.064
The field is thick with the dead.

04:16.132 --> 04:19.267
Deserved fate.

04:19.334 --> 04:22.337
For all who would see us
again to shackle and whip.

04:34.683 --> 04:36.117
Another standard lost?

04:38.253 --> 04:41.189
It is a grave wound inflicted
upon the Republic, Cossinius.

04:41.256 --> 04:42.657
A deeper one would have been suffered,

04:42.725 --> 04:45.226
had we not withdrawn from battle.

04:45.294 --> 04:47.996
It confounds the fucking senses.

04:48.063 --> 04:50.598
How could a handful of errant
slaves continue to vex us?

04:50.666 --> 04:53.000
I fear their numbers have
been sorely underestimated

04:53.068 --> 04:54.368
within the Senate.

04:54.436 --> 04:55.970
<i>Spartacus' mongrel horde has swelled</i>

04:56.037 --> 04:57.337
with each passing victory,

04:57.404 --> 04:59.607
since Glaber's defeat at Vesuvius.

05:03.812 --> 05:05.012
They added thousands to rank

05:05.080 --> 05:06.981
liberating the mines of Lucania.

05:16.192 --> 05:18.093
Slaves across the Republic,

05:18.161 --> 05:19.194
humble and grateful to their masters

05:19.262 --> 05:21.629
for so many years,
have broken to treachery

05:21.697 --> 05:24.198
<i>in the wake of ever expanding</i>
<i>legend of Spartacus.</i>

05:27.303 --> 05:28.870
Untold numbers joined his cause

05:28.937 --> 05:31.205
after Scrofa fell to him
on the banks of the Calor.

05:45.047 --> 05:47.815
His standards and
fasces falling to the enemy,

05:47.883 --> 05:49.984
as the man himself.

05:50.852 --> 05:52.552
Such chaos and death at the hands

05:52.620 --> 05:54.854
of a fucking slave.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.155
You will discover this fucking slave

05:56.223 --> 05:58.056
at the very gates of Rome itself,

05:58.124 --> 05:59.624
if reinforcements are not dispatched.

06:00.827 --> 06:04.630
Lucullus battles Mithridates
near the Black Sea.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.767
Antonius sails against
the pirates plaguing Crete.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.569
<i>Pompey yet struggles with the renegade.</i>

06:09.636 --> 06:11.771
<i>Sertorius in Espainia.</i>

06:11.839 --> 06:13.473
The resources of the Senate

06:13.541 --> 06:15.175
are drained by these conflicts.

06:15.242 --> 06:18.778
We have not the men nor
the coin to procure them.

06:20.981 --> 06:25.418
There is one among us
who could fund endeavor

06:25.485 --> 06:27.385
from his own purse.

06:27.453 --> 06:30.649
<i>And never feel sting of its cost.</i>

06:30.717 --> 06:33.445
I had hoped to avoid involving the man.

06:33.513 --> 06:37.240
We would not be beholden to him
any more than you, Metellus.

06:37.307 --> 06:39.207
Produce alternative,
and we shall seize upon it.

06:45.215 --> 06:46.582
Very well.

06:46.650 --> 06:49.152
I shall return to Rome
and entreat Crassus

06:49.219 --> 06:51.721
to aid in crushing
Spartacus and his rebellion.

06:53.190 --> 06:56.326
And in the act, attempt
to redress grievous injury

06:56.394 --> 06:58.395
inflicted upon the honor
of the Republic.

07:15.580 --> 07:18.349
The field has been stripped
of weapons and horses.

07:18.417 --> 07:20.751
The Romans' loss again
becomes our bounty.

07:20.819 --> 07:22.653
What of Gannicus?

07:22.721 --> 07:24.421
I would have his report as well.

07:24.489 --> 07:25.822
You well know the man.

07:25.890 --> 07:28.425
He favors celebration after a victory.

07:28.493 --> 07:29.693
Often for many days.

07:29.761 --> 07:31.495
A thing I would gladly give blessing.

07:31.563 --> 07:35.266
After Cossinius and
Furius fall from concern.

07:35.333 --> 07:37.401
They have proven themselves no fools.

07:37.469 --> 07:39.003
And may yet attempt bold maneuver.

07:39.071 --> 07:41.238
Double our sentries
in surrounding hills.

07:41.306 --> 07:42.540
I would not be caught unaware.

07:42.608 --> 07:44.342
You give those shits credit beyond due.

07:44.409 --> 07:46.844
Underestimating your opponent
is a Roman trait, Agron.

07:46.912 --> 07:48.980
Do not fall prey to it.

07:49.048 --> 07:52.850
Cossinius and Furius come
to the end of their days.

07:52.918 --> 07:55.654
With each passing sun,
hundreds of slaves

07:55.722 --> 07:57.689
break bond to join our cause.

07:57.757 --> 08:00.326
Agron is not wrong in this.

08:00.393 --> 08:02.995
Soon we shall have
the advantage of numbers.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.201
Gauge prowess
of all that have joined us,

08:09.269 --> 08:11.070
and see them readied.

08:11.137 --> 08:13.772
I would strike again
at nearest opportunity,

08:13.840 --> 08:16.608
and give further warning
to the fools in Rome

08:16.676 --> 08:19.378
seeking to grind us beneath heel.

08:49.872 --> 08:53.234
Every day for months
he wrestles with the man,

08:53.300 --> 08:55.468
groans and grunts filling ear.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.903
Your father is a dedicated student.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.739
And I forced to stand
witness to the lessons,

09:00.807 --> 09:03.942
while more pressing
matters fall to ill attention.

09:16.019 --> 09:17.352
Apologies, Dominus.

09:17.420 --> 09:19.755
I lose myself in the heat of contest.

09:26.162 --> 09:28.496
Less than a scratch.

09:28.564 --> 09:33.369
Worse deserved for
not anticipating blow.

09:33.437 --> 09:35.072
You are quick of study.

09:35.140 --> 09:36.508
Yet you open flank to injury

09:36.576 --> 09:39.745
when perceived advantage is pressed.

09:39.813 --> 09:43.483
The ruin of many
a man within the Senate.

09:43.550 --> 09:46.920
Let us return to lesson
after evening meal is broken.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.188
Dominus.

09:50.124 --> 09:52.759
The rumors prove true, Crassus.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.928
You take instruction from a slave.

09:55.996 --> 09:59.766
Hilarus stood a champion
of the arena for many years.

09:59.834 --> 10:01.801
I paid his lanista more
coin than you'll ever see

10:01.869 --> 10:04.437
in your life to purchase the man,

10:04.505 --> 10:07.273
and impart what he's
learned of the games.

10:07.341 --> 10:10.577
And of the men who have
drawn blood upon the sands.

10:10.644 --> 10:11.745
Gladiators.

10:11.812 --> 10:15.448
You strike upon very
subject of my visit.

10:15.516 --> 10:17.417
If we may break word in private?

10:17.485 --> 10:21.821
Oh, Tiberius is well trained
in the ways of men.

10:21.889 --> 10:25.058
I would expose him to
those of the Senate as well.

10:26.461 --> 10:28.931
To the matter,

10:28.999 --> 10:30.371
we've have suffered
unexpected complications

10:30.439 --> 10:33.278
in our conflict
with the rebel Spartacus.

10:33.349 --> 10:37.226
Cossinius and Furius have fallen?

10:37.294 --> 10:38.561
<i>They live, but find themselves</i>

10:38.629 --> 10:40.897
<i>in need of reinforcement.</i>

10:40.964 --> 10:42.198
<i>An expensive thing to acquire,</i>

10:42.266 --> 10:44.233
<i>in these troubled times.</i>

10:47.805 --> 10:50.006
Their asses must
be sore from the ramming

10:50.074 --> 10:53.276
Spartacus has given,
to come begging to me.

10:53.344 --> 10:55.245
No one is begging.

10:55.313 --> 10:56.446
They are asking assistance

10:56.514 --> 10:58.649
from a loyal member of the Senate.

10:58.716 --> 11:01.051
How much assistance?

11:01.119 --> 11:02.586
Ten thousand men.

11:08.325 --> 11:09.965
It would take
considerable coin and effort

11:09.993 --> 11:11.760
to raise such a force.

11:11.828 --> 11:14.931
And in return you
will be offered a command.

11:14.998 --> 11:17.666
<i>Under Cossinius and Furius, of course.</i>

11:19.636 --> 11:23.005
An offer better received
from the men themselves.

11:23.073 --> 11:25.174
They've withdrawn
to a villa on the outskirts

11:25.242 --> 11:26.709
of Nuceria, within short ride

11:26.777 --> 11:29.478
<i>of what remains of their</i>
<i>legion to the north.</i>

11:29.546 --> 11:31.447
Spartacus continues to gather force

11:31.515 --> 11:32.982
in the valley of Campania.

11:33.050 --> 11:34.884
You know I would not have come

11:34.952 --> 11:37.220
if situation did not demand of it.

11:37.287 --> 11:40.489
No. You would not.

11:44.894 --> 11:46.694
Their terms are agreeable.

11:49.564 --> 11:52.399
I will dispatch message
to them immediately.

11:52.467 --> 11:54.568
Best I send my own men,

11:54.636 --> 11:58.005
to ensure it arrives
at intended destination.

11:58.073 --> 12:00.007
Whatever your will.

12:02.277 --> 12:04.645
To voice truth of it,
I had expected you to extort

12:04.712 --> 12:07.047
inflated title at the very least,

12:07.114 --> 12:11.417
as Pompey did to take his
charge against Sertorius.

12:11.485 --> 12:16.589
My interest lies only
in title and honor earned.

12:16.657 --> 12:19.259
Apologies for ever suspecting less.

12:25.236 --> 12:27.971
You would agree to serve
beneath Cossinius and Furius,

12:28.038 --> 12:29.839
absent true command?

12:29.907 --> 12:30.974
It would appear so.

12:31.042 --> 12:32.976
I have heard how you berate their names,

12:33.044 --> 12:36.381
how foolish and vain you
think them and Senator Metellus.

12:36.449 --> 12:38.483
Father --
The time for words has ended.

12:38.551 --> 12:41.086
Spartacus must fall,

12:41.153 --> 12:43.388
and I shall set upon what path I must

12:43.455 --> 12:45.623
to see day hastened.

12:47.459 --> 12:48.693
For the glory of Rome.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.928
I saw it with my own fucking eyes!

13:14.996 --> 13:18.231
In the heat of battle, blood
and brains thick to the knee.

13:18.299 --> 13:20.699
And Gannicus, in the middle of it all!

13:20.767 --> 13:23.003
Strips to his fucking cock,

13:23.071 --> 13:25.906
bellowing to the Romans
to kneel before him

13:25.973 --> 13:29.042
and receive golden tribute!

13:30.278 --> 13:32.846
In my defense, I had taken
much wine that day,

13:32.914 --> 13:36.416
not expecting Spartacus
to turn and attack Scrofa.

13:36.484 --> 13:38.618
There is more wine?

13:40.388 --> 13:43.390
My friends, are of thirst.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.697
<i>Your woman brings gifts!</i>

13:50.765 --> 13:52.266
Gifts, yes.

13:53.268 --> 13:54.268
Not for you.

14:00.742 --> 14:02.910
Out.

14:02.978 --> 14:04.345
Out.

14:04.413 --> 14:06.013
It is my fucking tent.

14:06.081 --> 14:07.014
Out.

14:07.082 --> 14:08.282
We shall find another.

14:08.350 --> 14:09.850
Hopefully as well stocked.

15:28.434 --> 15:31.269
Is it imagining,
or do we rise to heights

15:31.337 --> 15:34.339
unknown in wake of battle?

15:34.406 --> 15:37.842
As all men do, when bathed
in blood and victory.

15:41.381 --> 15:43.315
When Rome falls, I fear we shall

15:43.383 --> 15:46.587
split the heavens in celebration.

15:46.654 --> 15:50.491
And fuck Jupiter

15:52.026 --> 15:54.061
as he plummets to the earth.

15:54.129 --> 15:57.264
Oh, you believe you fuck as a god now?

15:57.332 --> 15:59.733
I boast but upon evidence given.

15:59.801 --> 16:02.169
Couple proud words with wine,

16:02.237 --> 16:04.272
and see them better received.

16:06.809 --> 16:08.710
You afforded yourself well
upon the field this day.

16:08.778 --> 16:11.179
You stand surprised?

16:12.882 --> 16:16.251
I have always believed in you, Nasir.

16:16.319 --> 16:17.819
Even when you were yet a contrary

16:17.887 --> 16:19.421
little Syrian slave boy.

16:19.489 --> 16:22.224
My eyes were yet shrouded.

16:22.292 --> 16:25.360
I am forever in Spartacus'
debt, for parting veil.

16:27.731 --> 16:30.899
A debt shared equally by all.

16:30.967 --> 16:33.668
One we shall repay with Roman lives.

16:40.342 --> 16:41.543
You summoned me?

16:43.179 --> 16:44.146
I would not have had to.

16:44.214 --> 16:45.381
If you had reported in with Crixus

16:45.449 --> 16:48.018
and Agron days ago.

16:48.085 --> 16:52.122
My attentions were called
by pressing matters.

16:52.190 --> 16:54.992
Of women and drink?

16:55.060 --> 16:59.063
Are there any more so?

16:59.131 --> 17:02.967
Days can not pass after
battle without your report.

17:05.003 --> 17:06.938
We fought.

17:07.006 --> 17:08.940
We won.

17:09.008 --> 17:10.675
Does that cover needed ground?

17:10.742 --> 17:13.345
Hmm.

17:14.413 --> 17:15.646
You have proven valuable asset

17:15.714 --> 17:19.083
against the Romans.

17:19.151 --> 17:20.818
Yet I would have you stand more

17:20.886 --> 17:23.755
than just another sword.

17:23.821 --> 17:25.924
Take rightful place
beside Crixus and myself,

17:25.991 --> 17:27.157
as a leader.

17:27.226 --> 17:28.159
I will give life to your cause,

17:28.227 --> 17:30.195
in honor of Oenomaus.

17:30.263 --> 17:32.630
I may even believe in
it myself upon a day.

17:32.698 --> 17:35.500
But I am no leader, nor seek to be one.

17:35.568 --> 17:38.870
There are many that already
look to you as such.

17:38.937 --> 17:42.473
A greater number still
would follow you in battle.

17:42.541 --> 17:43.507
You mean die for me?

17:43.575 --> 17:45.910
For the cause.

17:45.978 --> 17:48.112
I would not be set above my brothers,

17:48.180 --> 17:50.115
and thought greater than I am.

17:50.182 --> 17:52.016
As many begin to think of you.

17:52.084 --> 17:53.785
I do not wish it.

17:53.853 --> 17:55.653
Yet it is so.

17:55.721 --> 17:58.655
They begin to speak of you as a god.

17:58.722 --> 18:01.389
And may react poorly
when you prove yourself mortal.

18:01.457 --> 18:04.524
Victory against the Romans
is my only concern.

18:04.592 --> 18:06.425
And how is it defined?

18:06.492 --> 18:08.959
When Cossinius and Furius

18:09.026 --> 18:10.691
struck from this world?

18:10.759 --> 18:12.223
You know that will not be the end of it.

18:12.291 --> 18:15.360
Rome will send more
and more in their wake.

18:15.427 --> 18:19.425
Then they too shall fall.

18:19.492 --> 18:24.887
And when we have laid
waste to the mighty Republic?

18:24.955 --> 18:27.016
What will you turn
your wrath upon then hmmm?

18:30.577 --> 18:33.244
The men that set you on this path,

18:33.312 --> 18:36.613
the men that took your wife from you.

18:36.681 --> 18:39.082
They are gone from this world.
Their wives too,

18:39.150 --> 18:43.048
<i>in past news of Lucretia</i>
<i>and Ilithyia's fall.</i>

18:44.483 --> 18:47.651
A thousand lives
would not equal Sura's.

18:52.489 --> 18:54.818
I dared to love a woman once.

18:54.885 --> 18:57.715
When I was a slave to Batiatus.

18:57.783 --> 18:58.982
She yet draws breath?

19:02.683 --> 19:05.050
I would give the world to have it so.

19:06.951 --> 19:09.050
A fate too common, for men such as us.

19:09.118 --> 19:11.611
I had my vengeance, as you did.

19:11.679 --> 19:13.084
And stood as empty.

19:16.151 --> 19:19.084
Until Oenomaus forgave betrayal.

19:19.152 --> 19:21.651
Oenomaus?

19:21.719 --> 19:25.286
It was his wife I lost heart to.

19:28.321 --> 19:30.220
Even when freedom was gained,

19:30.287 --> 19:32.187
shackles

19:32.255 --> 19:37.022
of what I had done
to those I loved remained.

19:37.090 --> 19:40.123
With final breath,
Oenomaus struck chains

19:40.191 --> 19:41.723
that bound me.

19:45.259 --> 19:48.426
There is no one I hold to heart, left

19:48.493 --> 19:51.227
to break such balming words.

19:51.294 --> 19:53.894
Absent such, a man must
speak them to himself.

19:55.162 --> 19:59.228
Words also denied me.

19:59.296 --> 20:02.529
You seek them in the voice of
thousands, clamoring for blood?

20:02.596 --> 20:04.796
I could not save my wife.

20:04.864 --> 20:06.664
And I can fight to see a day

20:06.732 --> 20:11.100
when no innocent life
is so easily disregarded.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.700
A day when the Romans and their cruelty

20:12.768 --> 20:14.801
are but distant memory.

20:16.769 --> 20:20.003
May you find peace
in its arrival, brother.

20:28.007 --> 20:32.340
Let us share wine and women,

20:32.408 --> 20:35.308
and set aside such
heavy fucking thoughts.

20:35.375 --> 20:37.842
The offer is much appreciated.

20:39.744 --> 20:43.978
Then I will drink and fuck in your name.

20:44.046 --> 20:46.279
Fight when called upon.

20:46.346 --> 20:49.746
The very steps to the Roman Senate

20:49.814 --> 20:52.147
if that is where your madness leads.

21:03.951 --> 21:06.818
Raise offer to 350 denarii

21:06.886 --> 21:09.385
and two iugera of land.

21:09.453 --> 21:11.486
We must elevate numbers quickly.

21:11.554 --> 21:14.254
I will dispatch Sabinus and see it done.

21:17.257 --> 21:19.990
I thought you to bed.

21:20.057 --> 21:23.624
Tiberius has filled his ears
with talk of war.

21:23.691 --> 21:26.591
The battle rages in his head,
vanquishing slumber.

21:26.659 --> 21:27.659
Is it true?

21:27.726 --> 21:30.260
You ride with an army against Spartacus?

21:30.327 --> 21:31.393
Yes to defend the Republic,

21:31.461 --> 21:33.728
as is the duty of all Romans.

21:33.795 --> 21:36.562
I'm a Roman.
I will go with you.

21:36.630 --> 21:39.630
Oh, would
that you were of an age,

21:39.697 --> 21:42.231
to stand by your father's side.

21:42.299 --> 21:44.866
Now for your bed, Publius,

21:44.933 --> 21:46.533
and dream of future laurels.

21:46.601 --> 21:47.767
Yes, father.

21:52.703 --> 21:54.669
He would follow you to the shores

21:54.736 --> 21:58.304
of the afterlife, if so commanded.

21:58.372 --> 22:01.707
As would Tiberius.

22:01.775 --> 22:03.975
He will hold place amongst
my troops when they march.

22:04.043 --> 22:05.442
A place?

22:05.510 --> 22:07.143
He deserves position of note,

22:07.211 --> 22:08.980
worthy of the name he bears.

22:09.047 --> 22:10.249
He does not yet hold the years

22:10.317 --> 22:11.784
for the title of Tribune.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.151
Coin and persuasion would see

22:13.219 --> 22:14.319
such rules set aside--

22:14.386 --> 22:16.020
He has not earned it.

22:19.561 --> 22:23.066
Tiberius has shown great
promise as a soldier.

22:23.134 --> 22:26.175
Yet he falls from target
in strategy and discerning mind.

22:26.242 --> 22:28.583
Then lend instruction.

22:28.651 --> 22:30.755
My lessons never cease.

22:30.823 --> 22:33.422
It is for him to apply them.

22:33.490 --> 22:35.190
Your work carries into night?

22:35.258 --> 22:37.257
And threatens break of dawn.

22:38.692 --> 22:40.526
I shall see food and wine brought.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.362
Kore shall tend to my needs.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.399
Of course.

22:49.901 --> 22:51.701
Your bed awaits.

22:51.768 --> 22:53.839
If you find want of it.

23:01.586 --> 23:03.687
It is an honor long deserved,
to be given command.

23:03.755 --> 23:06.357
One he finds beneath
Cossinius and Furius.

23:06.424 --> 23:07.625
I have never known your father

23:07.692 --> 23:09.527
to remain beneath anyone
for length of time.

23:09.594 --> 23:11.395
Ah, perhaps the years
have tempered desire

23:11.463 --> 23:13.831
for laurels and adulation of the crowds.

23:13.899 --> 23:16.300
And what of your desires?

23:16.368 --> 23:18.569
Apollo himself would be
set ablaze by them.

23:18.637 --> 23:20.204
I shall remember not to stand too near,

23:20.272 --> 23:21.573
for fear of melted wings.

23:23.943 --> 23:26.912
I would not have you from
my side in this, Sabinus.

23:26.979 --> 23:29.148
The gods themselves could
not wrest me from it.

23:32.053 --> 23:33.386
I will see offer raised
and numbers elevated.

23:33.454 --> 23:34.688
Gratitude.

23:40.528 --> 23:44.564
I recall a time when you and
Sabinus were but children,

23:44.632 --> 23:46.466
playing at war with wooden sticks.

23:46.534 --> 23:49.002
Such games are of the past.

23:49.070 --> 23:53.140
A thing yet proven to your father.

23:53.208 --> 23:55.943
Do not give him cause
to further doubt you.

23:56.011 --> 23:59.380
Any shall be swept from thought,

23:59.448 --> 24:03.818
when I stand awash in
the blood of our enemies.

24:06.122 --> 24:07.755
Watch your left!

24:07.823 --> 24:10.091
Watch for the swing!

24:10.159 --> 24:11.725
Raise fucking guard!

24:11.793 --> 24:14.028
Your boy grows fiercer by the day.

24:14.096 --> 24:16.431
Soon even I shall fear
to call him little man.

24:16.499 --> 24:18.633
At least now I will be able to
understand you when you yield,

24:18.701 --> 24:20.135
you simple shit.

24:25.141 --> 24:26.908
Spartacus...

24:26.976 --> 24:30.412
<i>Next man!</i>
<i>Take position!</i>

24:30.479 --> 24:32.914
<i>Let's go! Let's go!</i>

24:32.982 --> 24:34.349
Begin!
Come on!

24:37.720 --> 24:39.920
We test the last
of those that have joined us.

24:39.988 --> 24:41.188
How do you find them?

24:41.256 --> 24:45.192
Enthusiastic.

24:45.260 --> 24:46.393
Yet short of skill.

24:46.461 --> 24:48.896
Many among us once stood as such.

24:48.963 --> 24:50.864
These will soon prove as worthy.

24:50.932 --> 24:52.666
Perhaps not all.

25:02.143 --> 25:03.410
<i>Next man!</i>

25:10.785 --> 25:13.086
Do not speak of this.

25:13.154 --> 25:14.888
Go.

25:15.824 --> 25:18.092
Diotimos?

25:18.160 --> 25:19.994
If I were?

25:22.331 --> 25:23.664
Inside.

25:23.732 --> 25:24.740
Quickly.

25:32.408 --> 25:33.374
I can spare no more than this,

25:33.442 --> 25:35.343
so do not fucking ask.

25:35.411 --> 25:37.279
Gratitude, gratitude.

25:37.346 --> 25:39.247
You have killed a horse?

25:39.314 --> 25:40.614
Lower fucking voice.

25:40.682 --> 25:42.149
I would not follow the animal

25:42.217 --> 25:44.418
in crush news of meat would bring.

25:44.485 --> 25:47.054
Who gave permission?

25:47.121 --> 25:48.789
A man atop a horse in
battle is valued ten

25:48.856 --> 25:49.890
upon foot.

25:49.957 --> 25:52.126
He was gravely wounded
against the Romans.

25:52.193 --> 25:53.394
I would have sought permission

25:53.462 --> 25:55.162
from the great man upon the hill,

25:55.230 --> 25:59.567
but King Spartacus is far
too busy waging war

25:59.634 --> 26:01.602
to bother with such low concerns.

26:01.669 --> 26:03.103
What moves you to such thoughts?

26:03.171 --> 26:07.308
Open fucking eyes you have your answer.

26:07.376 --> 26:10.177
I begin to question turning from
the calm of the ocean breeze

26:10.245 --> 26:13.380
and the safety of my city's walls.

26:13.448 --> 26:15.215
You were a free man, then?

26:15.283 --> 26:16.483
Far removed.

26:16.550 --> 26:19.618
I toiled beneath the heel
of a most unpleasant shit

26:19.686 --> 26:21.020
in Sinuessa en Valle.

26:21.088 --> 26:24.324
Yet he at least provided
for fucking needs.

26:24.392 --> 26:27.127
Did you expect freedom
to come absent cost?

26:27.195 --> 26:28.228
No.

26:28.296 --> 26:32.800
Yet absent fucking plan
to be clothed or fed

26:32.868 --> 26:35.370
we must take matters into our own hands.

26:35.438 --> 26:37.505
Or risk early grave
waiting for the Bringer

26:37.573 --> 26:40.909
of Fucking Rain to bless us
with much needed shower.

26:51.487 --> 26:53.588
Weather will soon turn cold,

26:53.656 --> 26:55.590
and with it--
<i>Spartacus!</i>

26:55.658 --> 26:57.225
A clutch of Romans ride from the north,

26:57.292 --> 26:59.193
attempting to slip past our position.

26:59.261 --> 27:02.463
You are Spartacus?

27:02.531 --> 27:04.866
Apologies, I-I did --
Still tongue.

27:04.933 --> 27:07.736
You may not always have
full belly or warm cloak,

27:07.803 --> 27:09.538
but while I draw breath you have freedom

27:09.605 --> 27:12.441
to speak your heart.

27:12.508 --> 27:14.510
Even against the great
man upon the hill.

27:19.315 --> 27:20.749
Fuck the gods.

27:55.684 --> 27:57.619
You there!

27:57.686 --> 28:00.221
What is your purpose so
near rebel encampment?

28:10.900 --> 28:13.968
Who else is with you?

28:14.036 --> 28:17.672
Find fucking tongue.

28:17.740 --> 28:19.274
Who is with you?

28:21.911 --> 28:23.378
Death.

28:26.382 --> 28:27.849
Rahh!

29:19.802 --> 29:20.735
We must follow.

29:20.803 --> 29:22.470
No. A spear. Quickly.

29:32.681 --> 29:34.682
I stand your equal with sword.

29:34.750 --> 29:36.950
Yet you have me by fucking spear.

29:37.018 --> 29:38.519
Spartacus.

29:38.587 --> 29:40.654
This one carried a message.

29:47.730 --> 29:49.163
<i>What does it say?</i>

29:51.767 --> 29:53.401
Ten thousand?

29:53.468 --> 29:56.404
Led by Marcus Crassus Himself.

29:56.472 --> 29:58.706
Cossinius and Furius will
see their numbers swell,

29:58.774 --> 30:01.809
stripping advantage.

30:01.877 --> 30:05.045
We could lay trap.
Here, upon the Appian Way.

30:05.113 --> 30:06.247
Catch them by surprise
before they have chance

30:06.314 --> 30:07.381
to join their brothers.

30:07.448 --> 30:08.488
That would place us between.

30:08.516 --> 30:09.849
Crassus advancing from the north

30:09.917 --> 30:11.984
and Cossinius and Furius in the south.

30:12.051 --> 30:14.420
We do not have the men to face
armies on both fronts.

30:15.589 --> 30:16.989
We must strike Cossinius and Furius

30:17.057 --> 30:19.025
before odds tip to imbalance.

30:19.092 --> 30:20.960
We have inflicted nagging wound.

30:21.028 --> 30:24.196
Yet for months we have failed
to shatter resolve of their men.

30:24.264 --> 30:25.631
Perhaps the heads of their commanders

30:25.698 --> 30:27.900
carried before us would so sway them.

30:28.968 --> 30:31.703
Trophies proven difficult to win.

30:31.771 --> 30:35.841
On the field of battle, yes.

30:35.909 --> 30:39.111
By what is written here,
message was not directed

30:39.179 --> 30:41.448
to where their troops lie.

30:41.515 --> 30:44.884
It speaks of hope that
word finds them safe

30:44.952 --> 30:46.352
within the villa.

30:46.420 --> 30:48.187
They have gone to ground?

30:48.255 --> 30:50.456
Warm bath and the comfort of women,

30:50.524 --> 30:52.424
if my days in Rome are of worth.

30:52.493 --> 30:53.627
Where is this villa?

30:53.694 --> 30:56.163
It does not say.

30:56.231 --> 30:58.565
Then we return to beginning.

30:58.633 --> 31:02.069
We intercepted Crassus'
men here, riding southeast.

31:02.137 --> 31:03.537
Cossinius and Furius would seek to stay

31:03.605 --> 31:06.206
within reasonable distance of their men.

31:06.274 --> 31:07.608
Would place their villa

31:07.675 --> 31:09.276
somewhere within this region.

31:09.344 --> 31:11.878
How do we divine which is theirs?

31:11.946 --> 31:13.580
They are no fools, as you have said.

31:13.648 --> 31:16.249
We will know location
by placement of sentries.

31:16.317 --> 31:18.651
And sizable force they no doubt have

31:18.719 --> 31:20.487
without villa to lend protection.

31:20.555 --> 31:23.924
Then we descend upon them
with every sword we have.

31:23.992 --> 31:26.193
No.

31:26.261 --> 31:28.496
We risk discovery moving against
the villa with large numbers.

31:28.563 --> 31:30.498
Cossinius and Furius would be alerted,

31:30.566 --> 31:32.634
and have chance to slip
again from grasp.

31:35.605 --> 31:38.140
Yet a few men might penetrate
defense unnoticed...

31:38.208 --> 31:39.975
A few against many.

31:40.043 --> 31:42.245
Much as the old days.

31:42.312 --> 31:46.149
Gannicus, Crixus--
I would have you at my side.

31:46.216 --> 31:48.651
I am to stand idle,
with arm up fucking ass?

31:48.719 --> 31:50.353
You are to lead in my absence.

31:50.421 --> 31:53.122
Gather every man and woman
that can hold weapon.

31:53.190 --> 31:55.591
<i>Towards what purpose?</i>

31:55.658 --> 31:58.193
One of vital importance,
if we are to gain victory.

32:00.730 --> 32:02.264
It is plan born of fevered mind.

32:02.332 --> 32:04.400
As often springs from his brow.

32:04.468 --> 32:06.469
Yet if we can see it--
If.

32:06.536 --> 32:09.972
A word forever casting shadow.

32:10.040 --> 32:13.275
You burn brightly enough
to light darkest night.

32:13.343 --> 32:16.912
I voice concern and you offer flattery.

32:16.980 --> 32:19.681
I offer truth.

32:19.749 --> 32:23.151
Your fire blazes to
rival the fucking sun.

32:25.421 --> 32:30.326
These hands, once trembled
with broken memory,

32:30.393 --> 32:36.366
now stand as strong
as the steel they wield.

32:36.433 --> 32:37.567
Because of you.

32:37.635 --> 32:39.869
Because your heart is strong.

32:39.937 --> 32:44.006
And your will undeniable force,

32:44.074 --> 32:49.745
as I have often discovered.

32:49.813 --> 32:52.080
I would not be from your side.

32:52.148 --> 32:54.116
Nor I yours,

32:54.183 --> 32:56.885
but this night it must be so.

32:59.723 --> 33:02.058
Stay near to Agron,

33:02.125 --> 33:04.660
and follow command.

33:07.498 --> 33:10.233
Kill many Romans.

33:12.770 --> 33:15.772
And return to my arms

33:15.840 --> 33:18.709
with their blood

33:18.777 --> 33:21.111
hot upon you.

33:22.013 --> 33:24.081
The bodies of the dead

33:24.149 --> 33:27.484
be all that greet Crassus and his army.

33:33.025 --> 33:34.525
Sword.

33:34.593 --> 33:35.894
There is yet much to be done,

33:35.962 --> 33:37.429
if we are to move against Spartacus.

33:37.497 --> 33:39.431
Hmmm, much.

33:39.499 --> 33:42.936
Yet you waste hour sparring
with a common slave.

33:43.003 --> 33:46.272
Was Spartacus not also once
thought of as such?

33:46.340 --> 33:48.375
Would you dismiss him
so casually as well?

33:48.442 --> 33:50.076
No. Yet for all
his victories

33:50.144 --> 33:52.112
Spartacus is still a slave.

33:52.179 --> 33:53.212
He's a man.

33:53.280 --> 33:56.249
No better or worse than
any sharing title.

33:56.317 --> 33:58.952
You would place him upon equal
footing with a Roman?

33:59.019 --> 34:01.054
In some regards, he's proven
to stand even higher.

34:01.121 --> 34:02.288
Psst.

34:06.428 --> 34:08.597
You believe wealth
and position grant you

34:08.664 --> 34:11.134
advantage over those beneath you?

34:11.201 --> 34:14.371
I believe we tower
above a slave in all things,

34:14.438 --> 34:16.473
no matter what name he bears.

34:16.541 --> 34:18.942
Then couple words with actions,

34:19.010 --> 34:20.543
and prove belief.

34:24.717 --> 34:25.750
Well, you've been well trained

34:25.818 --> 34:28.219
in the Roman ways of combat.

34:28.286 --> 34:30.688
Surely you can best a common slave.

34:58.916 --> 35:00.683
Apologies, Dominus.
I did not mean to...

35:00.751 --> 35:02.919
You did but teach lesson sorely needed.

35:05.890 --> 35:10.594
As Spartacus schools those
who consider themselves gods,

35:10.662 --> 35:14.665
perched far above lesser men.

35:14.733 --> 35:19.034
And laughs as they tumble
from the heavens.

35:44.519 --> 35:46.019
There are too many.

35:46.087 --> 35:47.387
Even for us.

35:47.455 --> 35:49.455
Then let us pause moment.

35:49.522 --> 35:50.989
And see numbers thinned.

35:53.526 --> 35:54.626
The die has been cast.

35:54.694 --> 35:56.195
We cannot reverse throw.

35:56.262 --> 35:57.863
There has been no word from Metellus.

35:57.931 --> 35:59.798
He takes overly long.

35:59.866 --> 36:01.032
And with what haste could we expect

36:01.100 --> 36:03.501
reply from Longinus for aid?

36:03.569 --> 36:05.736
Cisalpine Gaul lays
twice distance than Rome.

36:05.804 --> 36:08.439
At least consider
dispatching message--

36:08.507 --> 36:10.575
Praetor.

36:10.642 --> 36:13.044
The rebel army gathers near
our legions in the north.

36:14.613 --> 36:15.746
Give Mummius orders for first

36:15.814 --> 36:18.149
and second cohorts
to move to support them.

36:21.720 --> 36:24.088
To fuck with Crassus.

36:24.156 --> 36:27.292
We shall rejoin our men and
take Spartacus ourselves.

36:28.461 --> 36:30.361
Fetch armor
and sword! Quickly!

36:35.568 --> 36:36.768
Agron's advance on position

36:36.836 --> 36:38.737
to the north draws them away.

36:40.606 --> 36:41.773
Not all.

36:44.778 --> 36:47.546
The gods have heard my prayers.

36:47.614 --> 36:49.215
There is no boast in easy victory.

36:49.283 --> 36:50.584
Stay to the shadows.

36:50.651 --> 36:52.486
And let us end this.

36:58.727 --> 37:01.562
He speaks to me as he would a child.

37:01.630 --> 37:05.100
Then prove him wrong,
and do not pout as one.

37:08.369 --> 37:10.505
An army not yet raised to maturity.

37:10.573 --> 37:13.341
Preparation for long march
and campaign ignored.

37:13.409 --> 37:16.911
All in favor of playing
with this fucking brute.

37:19.281 --> 37:21.249
I do not understand his mind.

37:22.684 --> 37:27.388
Set aside wounded
pride and think as he would.

37:28.691 --> 37:30.892
And see shrouded mystery parted.

37:43.739 --> 37:46.907
Swiftly. Before they are
discovered from their post.

37:46.975 --> 37:48.709
We do not know how many await inside.

37:48.777 --> 37:50.611
Let us pray they are not too few.

37:50.679 --> 37:52.847
I am encircled by mad fucks.

37:52.914 --> 37:54.749
And begin to count myself as one.

38:08.198 --> 38:09.898
The gods favor us.

38:09.966 --> 38:12.701
Spartacus holds no belief in them.

38:12.768 --> 38:14.870
I pray this night they prove me wrong.

38:29.986 --> 38:33.656
Dominus, it takes
time to master technique.

38:33.724 --> 38:35.992
I well know it can swell frustration.

38:36.059 --> 38:41.898
My frustrations lie not with myself.

38:41.966 --> 38:44.367
Dominus? If I have done
something to offend...

38:44.435 --> 38:47.504
The only offense lies
in what you do not do.

38:47.571 --> 38:51.207
You hold back in your assault.

38:51.275 --> 38:53.643
Do you think I'm not worthy of it?

38:53.710 --> 38:56.045
As the Senate believes me
unworthy of a true command?

38:56.113 --> 38:57.781
No, Dominus.

38:57.848 --> 39:00.250
None stand more worthy
of respect than you.

39:00.318 --> 39:02.319
Then see it given.

39:02.387 --> 39:03.954
Come at me.

39:04.022 --> 39:06.390
As you would an opponent in the arena,

39:06.458 --> 39:07.924
absent thought of mercy.

39:07.992 --> 39:09.026
Father--

39:09.093 --> 39:12.129
We all have lessons that must learned.

39:12.196 --> 39:14.498
I would have this my final test.

39:14.566 --> 39:16.434
And in its completion,
knowledge that I am readied

39:16.502 --> 39:20.573
to face those trained in
your arts upon field of battle.

39:20.641 --> 39:22.075
You ask me to kill you.

39:24.111 --> 39:25.846
I command you to try.

39:27.048 --> 39:29.483
Then you command my death.

39:29.551 --> 39:32.754
If you're victorious, it will be
at the cost of my life.

39:32.822 --> 39:36.425
If you fall to my sword,
my life is equally forfeit.

39:36.492 --> 39:38.761
Tiberius.
Bear witness.

39:38.829 --> 39:40.262
<i>If Hilarus strikes me down</i>

39:40.330 --> 39:43.867
he's to be rewarded with his freedom

39:43.934 --> 39:45.502
<i>and ten thousand denarii.</i>

39:45.569 --> 39:47.037
You cannot be serious.

39:47.105 --> 39:50.441
A man's true enemy is doubt.

39:50.509 --> 39:51.949
A thing I would not carry into battle

39:51.977 --> 39:55.045
against Spartacus.

39:55.113 --> 39:56.314
Make choice.

39:58.017 --> 39:59.451
<i>Or fall where you stand.</i>

40:04.356 --> 40:06.958
Your will, Dominus.

40:07.025 --> 40:09.693
My hands.

40:21.373 --> 40:23.333
First and second garrison
ride to join the legion.

40:23.375 --> 40:24.642
Spartacus does not hold the numbers

40:24.710 --> 40:25.843
for decisive victory.

40:25.911 --> 40:28.245
What is his mind in such attack?

40:28.313 --> 40:31.282
Let us see his skull split open,

40:31.349 --> 40:33.817
and read his fucking thoughts
upon the ground--

40:42.526 --> 40:43.827
Spartacus.

40:53.070 --> 40:54.537
Stay together.

41:14.258 --> 41:15.292
You must stop this.

41:15.360 --> 41:16.994
He has given command.

41:17.061 --> 41:18.328
It must be obeyed.

41:33.042 --> 41:34.175
Come on!

41:52.495 --> 41:53.929
We must see you to safety.

41:53.997 --> 41:55.864
I will not fucking turn from him again.

41:55.932 --> 41:57.899
Seize reason. We will
return with more men

41:57.967 --> 41:59.201
and see Spartacus to his fate.

42:18.186 --> 42:19.486
Don't let them away!

42:20.555 --> 42:21.889
Go!

42:59.028 --> 43:01.296
You were waiting...

43:01.364 --> 43:05.200
for me to think you'd
made misstep I warned you of...

43:05.267 --> 43:07.535
Knowledge and patience.

43:07.603 --> 43:09.771
The only counter to greater skill.

43:11.307 --> 43:14.075
You have been well schooled.

43:14.143 --> 43:16.310
Know that your service

43:16.378 --> 43:20.248
will not pass unremembered.

43:28.992 --> 43:33.262
The coin I promised had you bested me

43:33.330 --> 43:36.299
shall be set towards monument

43:36.366 --> 43:40.836
to the storied gladiator Hilarus.

43:40.904 --> 43:42.404
It has been the greatest of honors

43:42.472 --> 43:44.140
to have served you, Dominus.

43:52.582 --> 43:54.417
The honor was mine.

44:04.862 --> 44:07.164
Fucking savages have
blocked us from egress.

44:07.232 --> 44:08.465
Take shelter here.

44:08.533 --> 44:11.202
I will not fall trapped
as fucking animal.

45:10.762 --> 45:11.995
Your cause is lost.

45:13.798 --> 45:15.399
The mistake is mine.

45:15.467 --> 45:18.035
In not foreseeing you would
attack in the night,

45:18.102 --> 45:20.671
as the thieves and cutthroats you prove.

45:20.739 --> 45:22.874
A mistake you shall not make again.

45:24.711 --> 45:26.846
Name terms of surrender,

45:26.914 --> 45:29.483
<i>and let us be done with this.</i>

45:29.551 --> 45:32.820
There are none I would trust
a Roman to honor.

46:02.218 --> 46:03.718
Gather their heads.

46:21.104 --> 46:23.672
A most ill-fated turn.

46:23.740 --> 46:24.707
And yet news of calamity

46:24.774 --> 46:26.709
does not end with their deaths.

46:26.776 --> 46:27.843
Absent proper command,

46:27.911 --> 46:29.151
I fear Cossinius and Furius' men

46:29.212 --> 46:31.314
will soon be scattered to the winds.

46:31.381 --> 46:32.448
Yes it was most unfortunate

46:32.516 --> 46:35.484
their leaders fell before my arrival.

46:35.552 --> 46:38.420
Even more unfortunate
that your messenger appears

46:38.488 --> 46:39.755
to have taken routes that passed

46:39.823 --> 46:41.690
so near the rebel encampment.

46:43.993 --> 46:47.229
Give plain voice.

46:47.296 --> 46:49.030
If you're of a mind.

46:52.802 --> 46:54.603
Let us move from clouded past

46:54.670 --> 46:58.073
and turn eye towards pressing future.

46:58.141 --> 47:00.109
Sole command and charge
to bring Spartacus

47:00.176 --> 47:03.045
to deserved end is now yours.

47:03.113 --> 47:06.515
Along with title of Imperator,
if you so wish it.

47:10.120 --> 47:11.754
I serve the glory of Rome.

47:13.290 --> 47:14.691
As do we all.

47:23.266 --> 47:25.334
You planned this.

47:25.401 --> 47:26.802
From the moment Metellus offered command

47:26.870 --> 47:28.771
under Cossinius and Furius.

47:28.838 --> 47:31.607
The House of Crassus bows to no one.

47:31.674 --> 47:32.741
How did you know Spartacus

47:32.809 --> 47:34.243
would make attempt on their lives,

47:34.310 --> 47:35.711
instead of fleeing when
knowledge was gained

47:35.778 --> 47:38.814
of your army advancing from Rome?

47:38.882 --> 47:42.818
Because it is what I would have done.

47:51.794 --> 47:53.028
Mummius and the last of the Romans

47:53.095 --> 47:54.462
flee to the west.

47:54.530 --> 47:55.730
Sight of their leaders' heads upon pike

47:55.798 --> 47:57.199
has broken fucking spirit.

47:57.266 --> 47:59.634
Let us give chase,
and see them all to equal fate.

47:59.702 --> 48:01.502
We have won our victory.

48:01.570 --> 48:02.570
I would see us far from here

48:02.638 --> 48:04.439
in advance of Crassus and his army.

48:04.506 --> 48:07.607
The mighty Spartacus turns
from unwinnable fight?

48:07.676 --> 48:10.544
Our numbers have grown
beyond wildest expectation.

48:10.612 --> 48:13.914
Yet winter will soon be upon us.

48:13.982 --> 48:17.884
To face hunger and cold
as well as Crassus

48:17.952 --> 48:20.353
would drag us to certain doom.

48:20.421 --> 48:23.523
We must seek advantage
of supplies and shelter.

48:23.591 --> 48:25.031
One that can be defended if set upon,

48:25.059 --> 48:26.927
until spring warms intent.

48:26.994 --> 48:28.461
There is not a villa in all the lands

48:28.529 --> 48:31.131
that could hold so many.

48:31.199 --> 48:34.468
No, there is not.

48:34.536 --> 48:36.537
Only a city could hold us now.

48:41.209 --> 48:45.480
And we shall tear one
from the flesh of Rome,

48:45.547 --> 48:47.949
and salt mortal wound

48:48.017 --> 48:50.184
with blood and death.
