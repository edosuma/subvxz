13:05.360 --> 13:08.091
Look, he probably
just floated downstream. Right?

13:08.240 --> 13:09.924
So let's head south.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.764
We'll find a spot.
We'll camp out.

13:11.920 --> 13:14.287
WARREN: There's only one direction
he could've gone.

13:14.480 --> 13:15.925
We'll stay
on the river's edge.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.845
If he's on the other side,
he'll give us a signal.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.764
What about getting Murphy
to California?

13:20.920 --> 13:23.127
Yeah. What about that?

13:23.320 --> 13:25.288
We'll put in 24 hours
of looking for him.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.807
And then we head west.

13:32.360 --> 13:34.249
SKETCHY: It's like my daddy
always told me.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.448
Never trust an Eskimo
in a windbreaker.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.682
And he would know,
'cause he was in the Merchant Marines.

13:38.840 --> 13:41.889
- You boys lost?
- Certainly not.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.690
- Matter of fact...
- Oh, no?

13:43.880 --> 13:46.770
'Cause either you lost
or you're trespassing.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.285
Which one is it?

13:48.440 --> 13:50.329
I was not aware they had changed
the property lines

13:50.480 --> 13:52.130
since the last time
we came through.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.760
Wasn't no last time,
'cause I woulda recognised you.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.524
- Well, I've been growing my hair out.
- No.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.762
I'm pretty sure
you ain't from here.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.764
- Am I right, Dale?
- Oh, pretty sure not.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.127
- We were just on our...
- Ho!

14:04.320 --> 14:05.810
How 'bout emptying them pockets first?

14:05.960 --> 14:10.284
(SIGHS) Well, caught us
on a slow day, boys.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.363
- Sorry to disappoint.
- Like he said.

14:12.520 --> 14:15.285
- Hey, what's the hurry?
- We got off onto the wrong foot here.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.488
You obviously look like
intelligent men

14:17.640 --> 14:20.325
with an eye towards progress
in future generations.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.245
What if I told you
today's your lucky day?

14:23.400 --> 14:25.641
Oh, I would agree.
Ain't that right, Dale?

14:25.840 --> 14:27.922
- Oh, you right about that.
- You're both right.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.730
'Cause it ain't every day

14:29.880 --> 14:32.042
you come in contact
with a modern miracle.

14:32.200 --> 14:36.285
Your maker's been smiling on you,
because today, I offer you

14:36.440 --> 14:39.808
the most rare and precious
of currencies.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.088
Everlasting life.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.208
What's he talking about?

14:44.400 --> 14:48.246
Uh...well, uh...if you're...
interested, we've got...

14:48.400 --> 14:50.289
- You got a stuttering problem?
- Well, yes, he does.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.044
And he's actually
very self-conscious about it.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.810
- So please.
- Let's just kill 'em.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.883
Then I guess you've never heard
of The Murphy.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.570
Alright, fine.
You don't wanna see him.

14:57.720 --> 15:00.644
Oh, I've heard of The Murphy alright.
Seen him, even.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.802
You've seen The Murphy, huh?
What's he look like?

15:03.000 --> 15:07.005
- Uh, he's a taller fella.
- T-t-taller fella? Really?

15:07.160 --> 15:09.242
Taller fella,
skinny as a bean pole?

15:09.400 --> 15:10.765
Short scraggly hair?

15:10.920 --> 15:13.764
Dark blotches on his skin?

15:16.560 --> 15:18.881
Oh, it's him. I knew it.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.771
- Wait a second.
- That's right. You've got me.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.651
If you're The Murphy,
then let me see you levitate.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.529
Oh, come on.
Who said he could levitate?

15:26.680 --> 15:28.523
- He can!
- Not on an empty stomach.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.887
- That's true?
<i>-l'll</i> tell you what is true.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.088
He can make you immortal.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.884
What's that?

15:35.040 --> 15:37.520
Reset your odometer.
Make you zombie-proof.

15:37.680 --> 15:39.762
Zombie-proof?

15:39.920 --> 15:41.763
Prove it.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.643
As I said, it's no accident
we're through these parts.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.450
We're wanderers, trying to

15:46.600 --> 15:49.206
cure this wretched land
of disease and sin.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.203
One bite at a time.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.761
- What do you mean, 'bite'?
-l'm glad you ask.

15:53.920 --> 15:58.005
You wanna be immortal,
old Murphy here's gotta bite ya.

15:58.160 --> 16:01.801
But...everything comes
at a price.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.803
And it looks like
you got plenty to go around

16:03.960 --> 16:05.689
in that there
wagon of yours.

16:06.680 --> 16:09.490
Maybe not,
but you gotta ask yourself,

16:09.640 --> 16:12.166
how much is eternal life
worth to you?

16:13.960 --> 16:16.042
SKETCHY:
Hold him still, boys!

16:16.240 --> 16:18.083
If he moves too much,
it ain't gonna work.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.242
- Why not?
-'Cause the muscles tense up.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.448
It releases an acid
that counteracts the venom.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.250
- Hold still, Dale!
-l'm trying!

16:24.400 --> 16:27.404
Close your eyes!
Think good thoughts.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.930
Just do it already!
Just do it!

16:31.080 --> 16:32.570
You heard him!

16:32.760 --> 16:35.161
- Ow! Ow!
- SKETCHY: Hold still, Dale!

16:35.320 --> 16:37.482
-(SCREAMS)
- Hold still, Dale!

16:37.680 --> 16:41.765
Hold still! You're halfway
to a life of no worries!

16:41.920 --> 16:44.844
- Hang on, Dale!
- Ride that bull!

16:45.000 --> 16:47.651
- Ride that bull!
- Hang on, Dale!

16:47.800 --> 16:51.805
Oh! Sonofabitch!

16:53.320 --> 16:55.288
That's it!

16:56.560 --> 16:58.528
How do you feel?

17:01.040 --> 17:03.771
I'm cured!

17:03.920 --> 17:06.048
-I'm cured!
-(WHOOPS)

17:06.200 --> 17:09.204
Murphy! You alright?

17:10.880 --> 17:13.804
It takes a little bit out of him every time.
Who's next?

17:18.839 --> 17:22.002
- We sure do appreciate this.
- Fair is fair.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.127
Now, like I said,
you're gonna wanna rest up

17:24.280 --> 17:25.930
for at least 12 hours.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.888
You need to
metabolise that venom.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.883
Uh, now,
can we clean the wound?

17:30.040 --> 17:32.566
Not unless you wanna reverse
the whole process, Dale.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.165
You heard him, Dale.
Don't touch it!

17:34.360 --> 17:36.283
And no physical activity.

17:36.440 --> 17:39.762
You must remain perfectly still
for 48 hours.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.368
(GUNSHOTS)

18:00.520 --> 18:02.170
Did you see that?!

18:02.320 --> 18:04.209
- See what?
- A light.

18:04.360 --> 18:06.727
A light was flashing
way downriver.

18:06.880 --> 18:08.291
You saw a light.
What does that mean?

18:08.480 --> 18:11.211
10K, he signalled us.
Did anybody see it?

18:11.400 --> 18:14.961
- Roberta, you saw it, didn't you?
- No.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.407
Well, how can I be
the only one to see it?

18:17.560 --> 18:19.324
Maybe 'cause
there's nothing to see.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.563
We've gone far enough south.
We head west in the morning.

18:22.720 --> 18:26.167
- Who put you in charge?
- You're losing your head.

18:26.320 --> 18:27.765
Jeopardising the mission.

18:27.960 --> 18:29.405
DOC: What do you know
about the mission?

18:29.560 --> 18:31.528
You're just here
collecting a bounty.

18:32.520 --> 18:35.569
I mean,
who the hell are you anyway?

18:35.720 --> 18:37.529
Why are we
dragging him along?

18:37.680 --> 18:39.728
Let's not get it twisted,
old man.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.484
I'm escorting this prisoner
to California.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.762
I'm not putting him in danger
without a damn good reason.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.763
This is not
one of those reasons.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.048
Yeah, well,
it ain't up to you.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.690
Want to find out
if it is?

18:49.840 --> 18:52.889
Settle down.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.247
Nothing's happening tonight.

18:55.440 --> 18:58.046
And in the morning,
we'll re-evaluate.

19:00.920 --> 19:03.685
- You don't believe me?
- I believe you.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.446
Come on, Doc.
Don't let this take you down, man.

19:06.600 --> 19:09.331
We push on.

19:09.480 --> 19:11.482
We survive.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.482
That's all we can do.

19:14.640 --> 19:17.120
Maybe I'm tired of pushing on.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.168
Hey.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.970
I know.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.490
Get some sleep.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.490
There you have it.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.371
Opportunity presents itself,
just as I suspected.

19:45.520 --> 19:47.170
Telling you, kid.
You must be magic.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.561
There is no end to our good luck
since we met you.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.609
SKETCHY: It's true.
And it runs in my family.

19:51.760 --> 19:55.401
My Uncle Gerald's been
struck by lightning three times.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.483
Keys!

19:57.640 --> 19:59.449
I'm starting
to believe you guys.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.448
(ENGINE STARTS)

20:05.640 --> 20:08.644
(GROWLING AND POUNDING)

20:39.520 --> 20:42.364
MAN: Well, we thought
you mighta run into some trouble.

20:42.520 --> 20:44.921
Just the usual.

20:45.080 --> 20:49.244
Usually, you're right on time.
But don't matter.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.251
Uh, Swenson,
get these old boys a drink.

20:55.480 --> 20:58.723
I don't think we've met.
It's usually the other two.

20:58.880 --> 21:02.089
Oh! Pssh. Those two clowns?
Former employees.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.442
It's the price you pay
for delegating responsibility.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.250
But that's not your problem.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.641
Oh, yeah!
It's hard to find good help.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.768
We apologise on their behalf.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.570
That is not necessary.

21:12.720 --> 21:14.848
So, how'd we do?

21:15.960 --> 21:20.568
- Been better, been worse.
- Well, ain't that the truth?

21:20.720 --> 21:22.961
Uh, you get a drink, son?

21:23.120 --> 21:25.327
Uh,no,no,no,no,no.
Kid's a mute.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.767
Fell on his head as a baby.
But get him something stiff.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.490
Alright. We can get him
something strong.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.569
OK. Hey, one more for the mute!

21:31.720 --> 21:33.131
(SNARLS)

21:37.800 --> 21:40.167
"Pretty good", my ass!

21:40.360 --> 21:43.045
Well, look!
You done outdone yourselves.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.565
Apparently we have.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.929
Oh. I have been a rude host.

21:48.080 --> 21:52.847
I haven't even introduced myself.
My name is Tyler Burr.

21:53.040 --> 21:56.169
This is my town. Burrtown.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.129
- Fitting.
- Yeah.

21:58.280 --> 21:59.930
Mr Burr. Mr Smithson.

22:00.080 --> 22:03.562
This is my associate, Geronimo.
His grandaddy's part Apache.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.849
And this is our old boy
Renfield.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.923
We found him tied to a tree
in Kentucky.

22:09.080 --> 22:14.041
Well! My family came over
on the 'Mayflower', Mr Smithson.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.851
And we enjoyed
a pretty good run of it too.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.526
Until it all went
to hell in a handbasket.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.648
- Damn apocalypse.
- Oh.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.201
I'm talking about
the War of Northern Aggression.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.971
Fortunately,
what we have created here

22:27.120 --> 22:30.681
is a return to the glory,
made with our own hands,

22:30.840 --> 22:34.162
and that is what
this country is built on.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.482
Manufacturing, hmm?

22:36.640 --> 22:38.404
With able-bodied individuals,

22:38.560 --> 22:42.201
transformed by God himself
into builders,

22:42.360 --> 22:45.284
growers, energy creators.

22:45.440 --> 22:51.129
We have electricity,
a working distillery.

22:51.280 --> 22:54.762
And a community
that keeps an eye out on one another.

22:54.920 --> 23:01.769
We do not allow the afflicted to
drag us into the mud. No, sir.

23:01.920 --> 23:05.720
We wrangle 'em, tame 'em
and turn 'em into a workforce.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.008
You're a man of vision, Mr Burr.

23:08.160 --> 23:11.084
Well, it's all about protections,
Mr Smithson.

23:11.280 --> 23:14.807
Without protections,
this world's got no use for ya.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.724
Well, it's as I always say.

23:16.880 --> 23:20.805
You only need one friend,
so long as it's the right friend.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.606
Oh, I've said so myself
many times before.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.842
BURR: You pay the piper,
the piper keeps you safe.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.446
Facilitates
a life of recreation.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.967
You're gonna have to give me
your friend's number.

23:31.120 --> 23:33.566
(LAUGHS)

23:35.080 --> 23:37.560
Any friend of mine
is a friend of his.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.610
So enjoy some moonshine
and some women,

23:40.760 --> 23:43.081
both of which we have
in abundance,

23:43.240 --> 23:46.687
before you get back to your, uh,
recruiting tour.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.683
Appreciate the offer, Mr Burr,
but me and my friends

23:48.840 --> 23:50.649
are on a very tight schedule.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.643
We're gonna stay the night.
Road'll be too dark.

23:52.800 --> 23:54.450
- Oh!
-lt's noon.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.888
- Eventually, it's gonna be dark.
- Well, so true. So true.

23:58.080 --> 24:01.448
My friends,
let's freshen up those drinks.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.605
BURR: Make sure
you treat these boys right.

24:09.200 --> 24:11.646
Oh, sweet Jesus, hallelujah.

24:11.840 --> 24:14.684
Now we can get across
the damn river and find the kid.

24:14.840 --> 24:16.444
Oh, come on -
you really think

24:16.640 --> 24:18.324
you're gonna get this thing
all the way across?

24:18.480 --> 24:20.369
-I'm sure as hell gonna try.
- Doc...

24:20.560 --> 24:22.562
Don't waste your breath, Warren.
I'm going after him.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.449
You do what you gotta do,
but I'm going.

24:24.600 --> 24:26.284
What do you expect us to do?
Wait for you?

24:26.480 --> 24:28.323
- Do whatever you want.
- Then we head west.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.801
Am I the only one that cares
that 10K is out there?!

24:30.960 --> 24:32.485
- Of course not!
- MURPHY: I'm sorry.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.324
I thought there was a mission
that dictated

24:34.480 --> 24:38.451
our each and every action,
and that anything - anything! -

24:38.600 --> 24:41.524
was justifiable
in service of the mission.

24:41.680 --> 24:44.251
We take care of each other.
That's how we got this far.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.289
Without that,
there is no mission!

24:46.440 --> 24:47.805
Tell that to Cassandra, Doc.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.124
Or was she expendable?

24:51.280 --> 24:53.521
- He did what he had to do.
- Bullshit.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.324
He's a child with a gun

24:55.480 --> 24:57.084
who kills anything
he doesn't understand.

24:57.240 --> 24:58.890
And let's not forget.

24:59.040 --> 25:01.327
Each and every one of you
is expendable.

25:01.520 --> 25:04.888
There's only one piece
of precious cargo on this train.

25:05.040 --> 25:08.203
(LAUGHS) Well, brother,
at least we all know where we stand.

25:08.400 --> 25:11.165
Hey. It's not personal.

25:12.160 --> 25:15.528
Doc, are you willing to
throw it all away right here?

25:16.560 --> 25:19.131
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.367
We'll head south as far as
the Gortner Bridge.

25:23.520 --> 25:26.490
If you're there, we'll regroup.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.165
Otherwise...

25:29.720 --> 25:31.370
...this is it.

25:49.560 --> 25:51.562
Let's go.

25:55.040 --> 25:58.567
I told you! I told you
Elvis was still alive!

25:58.720 --> 26:02.645
Oh, he's alive alright.
And he's kept the weight off too.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.802
Tell him, Renfield.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.526
What's he saying?
What's he saying?

26:07.680 --> 26:11.526
No, no, no, you go.
No, you go. You go. OK. OK.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.330
He's talking about this time

26:13.480 --> 26:15.801
where he did this thing
that happened.

26:15.960 --> 26:18.611
(BURR LAUGHS) Amazing!

26:18.800 --> 26:20.689
I can't even believe it.

26:20.840 --> 26:23.127
It's hard to believe
at this point.

26:23.280 --> 26:26.409
- I got so many questions.
- Alright. Shoot.

26:26.600 --> 26:29.683
- How old is Elvis?
- He doesn't look a day over 60.

26:29.840 --> 26:32.844
-(GUN CLICKS)
- Give me one reason.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.482
I don't need much.
This world will not miss you.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.961
And you may be skinny,
but that wheel

26:39.120 --> 26:41.327
can always use another body -
ain't that right?

26:41.480 --> 26:43.642
You didn't mind
doing the devil's work

26:43.800 --> 26:45.609
so long as it suits you.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.489
Luring all those men
into your truck.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.324
That all sits right with you?

26:49.480 --> 26:51.642
- We didn't kill those men.
- So you can talk now, huh?

26:51.800 --> 26:54.690
We stole that truck.
We didn't know what was in the back.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.770
We had nothing to do with
capturing those zombies.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.685
My friends, they're alright.

27:00.840 --> 27:03.810
- They just like to tell stories.
- That, they do.

27:03.960 --> 27:06.770
I hardly know them, actually.
I was...l was part of a group.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.730
We were transporting
The Murphy to California.

27:09.880 --> 27:12.451
You've met THE Murphy?

27:12.600 --> 27:14.204
Yeah.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.482
- What's he like?
- He's a jerk.

27:16.640 --> 27:19.450
But the rest of them,
they were good people.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.171
We were trying
to save the world.

27:23.480 --> 27:25.084
Where are they now?

27:25.240 --> 27:26.924
Well, we were headed south
on the river.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.487
We hit a zombie jam.
I swam ashore, but...

27:29.640 --> 27:31.369
We were headed
to Gortner Bridge.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.170
If they're alive,
that's where they'll be.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.448
- You think they'll wait for you?
- I know Doc wouldn't leave me.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.409
He'd...he'd think of something.

27:39.200 --> 27:42.886
I had a husband.
Well, second husband, actually.

27:43.880 --> 27:46.804
In this world, that's all you need,
just one other person.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.849
That's reason enough.

27:50.880 --> 27:54.771
He's on that wheel over there.
In purgatory.

27:58.760 --> 28:02.242
I know what it's like to see
somebody you care about and...

28:02.400 --> 28:05.244
...know that they
need mercy, but...

28:05.400 --> 28:06.970
Actually doing it...

28:08.360 --> 28:11.967
Well, this whole town is wicked.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.363
I came here
with two thoughts in my mind -

28:15.520 --> 28:19.320
to release the man I love
and put him in his rightful place

28:19.480 --> 28:21.721
and to watch this town burn.

28:21.880 --> 28:23.530
I wouldn't mind
seeing that too.

28:26.960 --> 28:30.567
Hey, Renfield!
I just found your future ex-wife!

28:38.360 --> 28:41.330
Oh. Hey.
I think it's about time we took off.

28:41.480 --> 28:43.926
- Yeah.
- I need to make a call.

29:03.640 --> 29:06.530
Court is in session.

29:06.720 --> 29:10.930
The Honourable Judge Escorpion
presiding.

29:32.760 --> 29:36.048
These fools
stand accused of grand larceny,

29:36.200 --> 29:39.363
wilful deception and fraud.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.762
In case you were wondering,
I almost broke 80 today.

29:45.920 --> 29:48.366
Not only did you steal
from Mr Burr,

29:48.520 --> 29:50.682
you stole from the Zeros.

29:50.840 --> 29:53.889
And you robbed me of
the greatest golf game of my life.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.486
How do you feel about that?

29:56.640 --> 29:59.086
It's disappointing.

30:00.480 --> 30:02.369
Will you be acting
as your own counsel?

30:02.520 --> 30:05.091
(CLEARS THROAT) Uh...

30:05.280 --> 30:06.611
I will, Your Honour.

30:06.760 --> 30:09.445
- How do each of you plead?
- Guilty.

30:09.600 --> 30:13.400
With an explanation.

30:13.560 --> 30:17.406
Objection.
This man is a liar and a thief.

30:17.560 --> 30:20.166
- Overruled.
- Damn!

Please continue.

30:23.880 --> 30:25.689
(SIGHS)

30:28.840 --> 30:31.810
The path to truth,
it's not a straight line.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.406
It's squiggly.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.410
One man's truth
is another man's fallacy.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.967
And heretofore within -

30:40.120 --> 30:41.804
bear with me here -

30:41.960 --> 30:44.770
I am reminded of

30:44.920 --> 30:47.685
the case of Dred Scott
vs the City of Sacramento.

30:47.840 --> 30:50.207
We all remember that one, right?
I mean, who doesn't?

30:50.360 --> 30:54.285
Or Terry Bradshaw
vs the state of Oklahoma? Hello?

30:54.440 --> 30:56.090
- SKETCHY: Ring a bell?
- Objection!

30:56.240 --> 30:57.207

See, it's not my job

31:04.880 --> 31:06.211
to educate you
on legal precedents.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.010
That could take all day.

31:08.160 --> 31:12.165
But it is my job to illustrate
just how the accusers

31:12.320 --> 31:15.483
have attempted to defame and slander
myself and my clients

31:15.680 --> 31:18.968
by executing some kind of
fancy flea flicker

31:19.120 --> 31:21.600
on the fine citizens
of this great town.

31:21.760 --> 31:23.125
ONLOOKERS: Yeah!

31:24.120 --> 31:26.487
I don't believe
in the hidden ball trick,

31:26.640 --> 31:28.085
like these guys.

31:28.280 --> 31:30.009
Now, if I'm going up
against an opponent,

31:30.160 --> 31:31.810
I'm going
right down the middle.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.325
He's gonna see me coming,
by God,

31:33.480 --> 31:35.130
because I like
my steak rare!

31:35.280 --> 31:37.851
- Yeah!
- I like my whiskey straight up!

31:38.040 --> 31:41.487
- Hoo!
- I like my cars fast and my women rough!

- Yeah.

31:50.560 --> 31:54.326

thank you very much!

32:17.200 --> 32:19.043
You get that thing started?

32:19.200 --> 32:21.043
I'll give it a shot.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.690
Hey.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.009

all through it again.

What is that? That's what I'm asking.

- Well, those are...
- It doesn't matter!

33:24.240 --> 33:26.561
The point is...

33:26.720 --> 33:28.927
...you're all great people.

33:29.080 --> 33:33.369
You, you're a straight shooter.
You go right from the hip.

33:33.520 --> 33:36.888
You, you're honest-to-goodness.

33:37.040 --> 33:38.963
You, you're tried and true.

33:39.160 --> 33:41.288
You, salt of the earth.

33:41.440 --> 33:44.887
You, drop-dead gorgeous.

33:45.080 --> 33:47.845
What I'm saying here is, people,

33:48.040 --> 33:50.407
I wouldn't try to distract you

33:50.560 --> 33:53.882
with a bunch of random facts
and figures of speech,

33:54.040 --> 33:56.327
'cause you'd smell a fraud
from a mile away.

33:56.480 --> 33:59.450
And I have too much respect
for you.

33:59.640 --> 34:01.927
Oh, people, people, people.

34:02.080 --> 34:04.242
There's nothing to fear
but fear itself.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.846
And in summation,

34:07.000 --> 34:10.561
I'm thinking the words
of the great Clarence Thomas.

34:10.719 --> 34:14.406
If it don't fit,
you must acquit.

are con artists and thieves!

looking out for each other

35:29.360 --> 35:30.885
in this world anymore.

35:32.680 --> 35:34.728
But you always did.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.164
So if 10K's out there,

35:38.360 --> 35:40.124
he knows that.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.801
But we gotta go right now.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.767
And it's not for Murphy.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.370
It's for me.

35:51.520 --> 35:53.682

what he was getting into.

have been convicted of

36:58.240 --> 37:00.129

of grand larceny, identity theft

a whole bunch of lies.

Dear God.

37:25.800 --> 37:29.407
Please watch over
these poor souls,

37:29.600 --> 37:33.321
whose deviant and wayward paths
have led them

37:33.520 --> 37:36.364
to this unfortunate conclusion.

37:36.560 --> 37:39.882
We can only hope, oh, Lord,

37:40.040 --> 37:42.691
that they don't cause
as much trouble in hell

37:42.840 --> 37:46.083
as they have in this world.

37:46.280 --> 37:47.930

please get the word out

37:48.080 --> 37:50.367

any of my trucks,

40:51.840 --> 40:54.889
10K! Come on! We gotta go!

40:55.040 --> 40:56.883
- Let's go!
- Beat it, kid.

40:57.040 --> 40:58.769
We're not leaving here
empty-handed.

40:58.920 --> 41:01.048
- Come on. Grab my hand.
- Go, man.

41:01.200 --> 41:03.282
- We got this. I'm telling you.
- Seriously, we'll be fine.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.244
What are you talking about?
You guys are goners.

41:05.440 --> 41:08.205
- Are you kidding me?
- Don't you know by now, kid?

41:08.400 --> 41:11.210
We're the two luckiest bastards
you ever met.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.323
They're getting close!

41:14.760 --> 41:18.685
- Thank you.
- For what? We still haven't gotten you laid.

41:18.840 --> 41:21.320
-(BOTH LAUGH)
- For everything else, then.

41:42.960 --> 41:44.291
(ENGINE STARTS)

41:44.480 --> 41:46.642
(FRANTIC SNARLING)

41:46.800 --> 41:49.246
(TYRES SCREECH)

41:53.520 --> 41:55.124
Probably shoulda
ditched the weapons.

41:55.320 --> 41:57.926
Coulda, shoulda.
You know, they got a name for that.

41:58.080 --> 42:00.287
Monday morning quarterback.

42:00.440 --> 42:01.726
Well, if we can't
be self-critical,

42:01.880 --> 42:03.291
there's no room
for self-improvement.

42:03.440 --> 42:05.124
- Who said that?
- I did.

42:05.280 --> 42:06.850
Oh.

42:09.240 --> 42:11.129
- So I've been thinking.
- Not again.

42:11.280 --> 42:12.964
Where to next?

42:13.120 --> 42:14.531
I'm thinking
maybe Australia.

42:14.680 --> 42:16.170
They speak English there.

42:16.320 --> 42:18.129
True. But it's far, though.

42:18.280 --> 42:21.170
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

42:23.080 --> 42:26.004
- You ready?
- Sure.

42:26.160 --> 42:27.924
Why not?

42:28.080 --> 42:30.811
(BOTH LAUGH)

42:30.960 --> 42:32.564
(WHOOPS)

42:33.305 --> 42:39.545
