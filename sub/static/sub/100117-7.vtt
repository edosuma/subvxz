00:01.827 --> 00:04.830
You ever feel like you're the
punch line to some cosmic joke?

00:04.874 --> 00:06.484
What the hell
were you thinking?

00:06.528 --> 00:08.878
I think it's time
for me to move on.

00:08.921 --> 00:10.575
Sam's been trying
to call you.

00:10.619 --> 00:12.142
I know.

00:12.186 --> 00:14.362
When I shot Chuck,
the bullet wasn't a bullet.

00:14.405 --> 00:16.146
It w-- it was
a piece of me.

00:16.190 --> 00:21.151
So, what if it created
a-a link of some sort?

00:21.195 --> 00:23.153
Eileen,
we can bring you back.

00:40.997 --> 00:43.391
Alright,
we're almost there.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.523
You're so good to me,
Angela.
Mm-hmm.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.873
What would I do without you?
Hmm?

00:47.917 --> 00:50.789
What would I do
without my best friend?!

00:50.833 --> 00:54.228
Okay, Sally, okay, let's --
let's just get you home.

00:54.271 --> 00:57.100
Or...
Okay?

00:57.144 --> 00:59.972
...Ryan said there was
an after party at his house.

01:00.016 --> 01:02.192
No, no, no.

01:02.236 --> 01:03.933
No more after parties.

01:03.976 --> 01:05.369
No more drinking.

01:05.413 --> 01:07.067
No more guys.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.417
Uh-oh.

01:09.460 --> 01:11.767
Sally?

01:13.986 --> 01:15.249
Great.

01:18.252 --> 01:19.557
Purge your sins.

01:19.601 --> 01:21.733
Then we'll get you home.

01:59.858 --> 02:03.035
Angela?

02:12.088 --> 02:13.785
Angela?!

02:28.104 --> 02:30.062
Hello?

03:16.370 --> 03:17.588
Anything?

03:17.632 --> 03:19.242
Crop circles?

03:19.286 --> 03:21.723
Body without a heart?

03:21.766 --> 03:23.333
Anything?

03:23.377 --> 03:26.467
Come on, Internet.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.430
Oh, hello.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.608
Yeah.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.090
Sam:
It's never enough food.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.352
Hey.

03:42.396 --> 03:43.527
Ho-ho!Hey.

03:43.571 --> 03:44.876
Look who's alive.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.443
Yeah, mostly.

03:46.487 --> 03:47.749
You hungry?

03:47.792 --> 03:51.231
We have, uh, eggs,
pancakes, bacon.

03:51.274 --> 03:52.580
That real bacon?

03:52.623 --> 03:54.234
'Cause, you know, you...

03:56.932 --> 03:58.760
Are you two hungover?

04:00.283 --> 04:03.895
We might've gotten just
a little carried away

04:03.939 --> 04:06.594
with the margaritas
last night.

04:06.637 --> 04:09.249
Ho-ho!

04:09.292 --> 04:11.163
I knew I liked you.

04:11.207 --> 04:12.730
Sit. Eat.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.384
No, no.
Uh, nah, I can't.

04:14.428 --> 04:15.994
W-W-Wait, wait. Wait.

04:16.038 --> 04:19.389
You're turning down bacon?

04:19.433 --> 04:22.566
Mm, yes, yeah, I'm actually --
I'm gonna head out.

04:22.610 --> 04:23.915
Okay, fine.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.569
Just give us a second
to wrap this up,

04:25.613 --> 04:27.267
and we'll come with you.No, no, no. No.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.485
I'm -- I'm -- I'm good.

04:28.529 --> 04:30.095
You guys stay, eat.

04:30.139 --> 04:32.620
It smells terrific.

04:35.971 --> 04:37.407
Hey, Dean. Dean, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.627
Just hold on.
Slow down.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.150
No, I'm good.
I'm good.

04:41.193 --> 04:42.934
You're good?
W-What does that mean you're --

04:42.978 --> 04:44.936
It means I got to -- I got
to get out of here, okay?

04:44.980 --> 04:46.416
I just -- I got to --

04:46.460 --> 04:49.027
I'm gonna take a drive,
clear my head.

04:49.071 --> 04:50.768
Alone?

04:50.812 --> 04:53.162
Yeah, you know, you and Eileen,
you guys are having fun.

04:53.205 --> 04:55.164
I don't want to spoil that,
you know?

04:56.644 --> 04:58.428
Yeah, go, go.
Clear your head.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.125
Eileen and I
have stuff to do.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.344
Yeah, I'll bet you do.

05:01.388 --> 05:02.954
Yeah? Hmm?

05:02.998 --> 05:04.173
It's not like that.

05:04.216 --> 05:05.870
I-I-I meant looking for

05:05.914 --> 05:07.437
Chuck and Lilith and --

05:07.481 --> 05:09.134
Sure. Got it.

05:09.178 --> 05:10.875
Um, okay, but if, uh,
things go your way,

05:10.919 --> 05:12.790
just make sure you put
the sock on the door

05:12.834 --> 05:14.139
so I know.

05:15.358 --> 05:16.838
Call me if you need me.

05:16.881 --> 05:18.666
Always do.

05:24.846 --> 05:26.369
Is he okay?

05:26.413 --> 05:28.153
I think.

05:28.197 --> 05:29.329
It's funny.

05:29.372 --> 05:30.895
After everything with Chuck,

05:30.939 --> 05:34.159
uh, Dean was so...down

05:34.203 --> 05:37.249
I-I-I thought he wouldn't
get back up again,

05:37.293 --> 05:39.382
but -- but now,
him leaving?

05:39.426 --> 05:42.472
That's progress.
Right?

05:42.516 --> 05:44.518
Yeah, it is.

05:52.221 --> 05:54.049
Excuse me, Sheriff.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.182
May I help you?

05:57.226 --> 05:59.271
Agent Dukes.
Dukes?

05:59.315 --> 06:00.403
Like "put up your dukes"?

06:00.447 --> 06:02.362
Exactly.

06:02.405 --> 06:03.928
Sheriff Dillon.Good to meet ya.

06:03.972 --> 06:05.843
Listen, I'm looking
into the disappearance

06:05.887 --> 06:06.844
of Angela Sullivan.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.846
Disappearance?Mm-hmm.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.195
Uh,
I wouldn't go that far.

06:10.239 --> 06:11.501
No? Why not?

06:11.545 --> 06:13.677
Well, for one,
Angela's car is gone.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.287
Cars don't usually disappear

06:15.331 --> 06:17.507
unless they're being
driven somewhere.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.727
Okay, so you think what?

06:19.770 --> 06:21.032
That girl wasn't taken.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.120
She left on her own.

06:22.164 --> 06:23.295
You sure about that?

06:23.339 --> 06:24.732
Look, this is a small town.

06:24.775 --> 06:27.125
Angela's mom and dad
passed a few years ago,

06:27.169 --> 06:28.518
but even before they did,

06:28.562 --> 06:30.520
she was talking about
moving to L.A.,

06:30.564 --> 06:33.044
trying to get on
one of them competition shows,

06:33.088 --> 06:34.655
like the one
with the "Knight Rider."

06:35.786 --> 06:37.571
Right.
It happens.

06:37.614 --> 06:40.443
Kids usually last about a week
before they return.

06:40.487 --> 06:43.925
I stayed there
a whole month.

06:44.926 --> 06:47.972
Oh, they don't know
what they missed.

06:48.016 --> 06:49.844
I could've been
the next Denzel.

06:51.802 --> 06:53.108
Huh?

06:55.458 --> 06:57.329
Alright.

06:57.373 --> 07:00.245
Uh, why would her friend
report her missing?

07:00.289 --> 07:02.465
I don't know.
For the attention.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.336
Sally's got issues.

07:04.380 --> 07:05.599
What kind of issues?

07:05.642 --> 07:07.252
The kind that keep her
over at Swayze's Bar

07:07.296 --> 07:08.558
just about 24/7.

07:08.602 --> 07:09.907
Swayze.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.431
Sheriff,
thank you for your time.

07:11.474 --> 07:14.477
No problem.
Okay.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.740
Oh, Agent Dukes?
Yeah?

07:16.784 --> 07:18.742
Hollywood ain't that far.

07:18.786 --> 07:21.266
You could catch Angela there.

07:21.310 --> 07:22.746
While you're at it,

07:22.790 --> 07:26.010
you could show biz
a shot for yourself.

07:27.359 --> 07:29.144

11:20.201 --> 11:21.724
Wh--
What in the world, man?

11:21.768 --> 11:23.595
Where have you been?

11:23.639 --> 11:25.510
I-I've been calling you
and texting --

11:25.554 --> 11:26.990
I know. I was...

11:27.034 --> 11:29.166
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm here now.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.820
I'm ready to help.

11:30.864 --> 11:31.908
Hi.

11:31.952 --> 11:34.432
Yeah, uh, Cass,

11:34.476 --> 11:36.043
this is Eileen Leahy.

11:36.086 --> 11:38.698
Eileen, this is Cass.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.570
I thought you were --

11:41.613 --> 11:45.008
Dead?
Yeah, I got better.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.055
Uh, one-time thing.

11:49.056 --> 11:50.884
Well, where's Dean?

11:50.927 --> 11:53.713
He went for a drive.
He needed to clear his head.

11:53.756 --> 11:56.237
So we've been looking for signs
of Chuck and Lilith.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.847
Lilith?

11:57.891 --> 11:59.631
Yeah, uh, she's back.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.764
Have you found them?

12:01.808 --> 12:02.896
Not yet.

12:04.201 --> 12:05.855
It's because you're looking
in the wrong places.

12:05.899 --> 12:08.292
What do you mean?
Have you heard something
on angel radio, or --

12:08.336 --> 12:11.469
No, no.
It's been silent for months.

12:11.513 --> 12:14.472
But your wound --
it's still not healed?

12:14.516 --> 12:16.083
No.
Good.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.649
I've been thinking
about that gun,

12:17.693 --> 12:19.390
the, uh --
the Equalizer?

12:19.434 --> 12:23.090
When you shot God,
it fired a piece of your soul.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.874
Okay.

12:24.918 --> 12:28.748
So there may be some of you
inside Chuck.

12:28.791 --> 12:29.966
Ew.

12:36.538 --> 12:38.409
Oh, tell me, brother...

12:38.453 --> 12:40.063
Mm?...how's the old man?

12:40.107 --> 12:42.283
He died.

12:43.327 --> 12:44.894
Yeah, 13 years ago.

12:44.938 --> 12:47.114
But, hey, he was doing
what he loved the most --

12:47.157 --> 12:50.291
kicking ass
and taking names.
Yeah.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.296
I'm sorry, man.

12:56.732 --> 12:59.082
I appreciate that.

12:59.126 --> 13:02.085
I always liked
that crusty son of a bitch.

13:02.129 --> 13:05.785
Yeah.

13:05.828 --> 13:09.005
You remember that time
he caught us wasted on a Hunt?

13:09.049 --> 13:10.441
Hm?
He was so mad,

13:10.485 --> 13:11.965
I-I thought he was gonna
have an aneurysm.

13:12.008 --> 13:13.488
Oh, man,
but I tell you what.

13:13.531 --> 13:15.316
He always liked you.
He always liked you.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.318
In fact, he said that he'd never
seen anybody better in a fight,

13:17.361 --> 13:20.756
and that is high praise
coming from my old man.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.196
To John Winchester.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.156
Hey, thank you.Yeah, yeah.

13:31.332 --> 13:33.987
Man, so I don't think
I've seen you

13:34.030 --> 13:36.554
since Sammy
was in college.
Right.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.818
I mean, hell,
I-I thought you were...Dead?

13:38.861 --> 13:42.517
Well, I mean, that's usually
how this ends, isn't it?

13:42.560 --> 13:45.650
Yeah.

13:48.218 --> 13:50.133
Hm.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.138
You remember that cult thing
we did in Arizona?

13:55.182 --> 13:59.142
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.
Yeah.

13:59.186 --> 14:01.057
Well, I did one more case
after that,

14:01.101 --> 14:02.580
right around here,

14:02.624 --> 14:08.195
and...I decided that wasn't
the life for me anymore.

14:08.238 --> 14:11.981
I scrounged up what I could,
and I bought this joint.

14:12.025 --> 14:13.548
Living the dream.

14:16.072 --> 14:17.900
Let me ask you something.

14:17.944 --> 14:23.166
You ever regret it,
walking away?

14:24.733 --> 14:26.430
Not once.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.870
Cass,
are you sure about this?

14:30.913 --> 14:33.698
No, but I am sure
I can't heal the wound.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.048
Maybe I can probe it.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.354
Probe it?

14:37.398 --> 14:38.921
Study it,

14:38.965 --> 14:40.444
see if it can lead us
to Chuck.

14:41.576 --> 14:44.405
Is that dangerous?

14:44.448 --> 14:46.146
Probably.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.367
Alright.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.065
Let's do it.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.718
Sam...

14:53.762 --> 14:55.459
I'll be fine.

14:57.418 --> 14:59.376
I'm ready.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.595
This is gonna sting.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.386
Sam, are you okay?Yeah.

15:09.430 --> 15:10.779
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just, uh...

15:15.958 --> 15:17.220
Sam!
Sam!

15:17.264 --> 15:19.135
Sam!
Sam!

15:19.179 --> 15:21.398
Sam!

15:29.667 --> 15:31.843
Dean: This is Dean's
other-other-other-other phone.

15:31.887 --> 15:34.281
Leave a message.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.153
Dean, I need you
to call me back.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.763
Sam is hurt, and I...

15:40.374 --> 15:41.766
Where are you?

15:49.035 --> 15:50.514
Okay.

15:50.558 --> 15:53.256
One, three bottles of Jaeger
is nobody's friend,

15:53.300 --> 15:55.519
and "B," they were twins.

15:55.563 --> 15:57.260
Oh, no, no, no, no.Oh.

15:57.304 --> 15:59.001
Whoa, no,
they were not twins.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.307
They were triplets, uh,

16:00.350 --> 16:02.613
and we split them up
fair and square.

16:03.832 --> 16:06.530
That's right.
Triplets.

16:06.574 --> 16:07.531
Yeah.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.969
Yep.

16:10.012 --> 16:14.016
Lorna: Mm. Mmm.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.104
Hm.

16:24.244 --> 16:25.854
Castiel.

16:25.897 --> 16:27.638
Castiel: Sergei.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.901
I am surprised
to hear your voice.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.294
After last time,

16:31.338 --> 16:33.209
I didn't think we'd ever
do business again.

16:33.253 --> 16:36.038
I, um...

16:36.082 --> 16:37.648
I nee--

16:37.692 --> 16:39.824
I need your help.

16:39.868 --> 16:41.565
Sam Winchester's hurt.

16:41.609 --> 16:45.874
And you,
an angel of the Lord,

16:45.917 --> 16:48.007
are unable to heal him?

16:48.050 --> 16:50.009
This wound is unusual.
It's divine.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.488
Interesting.

16:51.532 --> 16:54.143
I figure, after Jack,
you owe me.

16:54.187 --> 16:57.059
And I'd love
to pay my debt,

16:57.103 --> 17:00.149
but, unfortunately,
this weekend,

17:00.193 --> 17:01.759
I'm with my niece.

17:01.803 --> 17:04.023
She just got a rolling
scholarship at USC,

17:04.066 --> 17:06.025
and I promised to take her
shopping, so --

17:06.068 --> 17:08.070
Let me rephrase.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.246
If you don't help me tonight,

17:10.290 --> 17:12.901
I will find you
and burn you alive.

17:15.121 --> 17:18.211
My, how your negotiation skills
have improved.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.824
Castiel?

17:32.921 --> 17:35.184
Hello?

17:35.228 --> 17:38.231
No.

17:38.274 --> 17:39.710
I need a favor.

17:39.754 --> 17:42.539
Ghost sickness.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.759
Ghost sickness?Ghost sickness.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.065
Man, it was no fun.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.544
Everything was scary.

17:47.588 --> 17:50.460
This cat jumped out at me,
had me checking my pants.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.549
I'm not joking.

17:52.593 --> 17:55.596
It was awful, man.
Whew!

17:57.119 --> 17:59.904
You haven't even told me what
case you're working on, man.

17:59.948 --> 18:01.645
Oh.
Right.

18:01.689 --> 18:03.125
So, a girl went missing.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.214
'Course, the sheriff thinks
it's nothing, right?

18:05.258 --> 18:07.129
Yeah, well,
the sheriff in this town

18:07.173 --> 18:09.436
couldn't find his ass with
a flashlight and a map.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.482
You recognize her?

18:14.049 --> 18:16.095
Mm, no.

18:20.011 --> 18:21.274
That's Angela, Lee.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.493
She's in here
all the time.

18:23.537 --> 18:26.235
Wait. Is this the girl that
doesn't drink that much?

18:26.279 --> 18:28.107
That's the one.But her friend?

18:28.150 --> 18:29.847
Like a fish.Is like a fish.

18:30.979 --> 18:32.285
Huh.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.766
What are you doing, man?What?

18:35.810 --> 18:38.029
You're chasing
missing persons, huh?

18:38.073 --> 18:40.945
I thought you'd be on
to something bigger by now,

18:40.989 --> 18:42.643
like the Loch Ness Monster...

18:42.686 --> 18:45.167
...Bigfoot.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.952
Trust me, uh, bigger doesn't
always equal better.

18:47.996 --> 18:51.478
Besides, who's gonna look out
after the little guy?

18:51.521 --> 18:53.436
God certainly isn't.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.917
Damn, brother,
that's dark.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.355
Yeah,
it's been a rough, uh --

18:59.399 --> 19:00.965
it's been a rough decade,
Lee.

19:01.009 --> 19:02.445
Yeah.

19:02.489 --> 19:05.013
But that's a conversation
for a different time,

19:05.056 --> 19:08.147
'cause this, this right here,
this is alright.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.974
Well,
I'm glad you approve.

19:10.018 --> 19:12.629
This is nothing
you can't have, man.

19:12.673 --> 19:14.979
Oh, come on.
Who's gonna kill the bad guys?

19:15.023 --> 19:16.503
Somebody else.

19:20.202 --> 19:23.031
Dean, how many lives
you think you saved, huh?

19:23.074 --> 19:25.642
Hundreds?
Thousands?

19:25.686 --> 19:27.731
You deserve a break, bro.

19:27.775 --> 19:31.605
Hell, you might even
deserve two.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.696
Remember that old song
your dad used to play us

19:35.739 --> 19:37.393
before we'd go out
on a Hunt?

19:37.437 --> 19:38.916
Yeah.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.483
Yeah, he'd pop it
in the tape deck, say,

19:40.527 --> 19:42.790
"Listen up, boys.
This is real music."

19:46.054 --> 19:47.925
He wasn't wrong.

19:47.969 --> 19:50.406
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.

19:50.450 --> 19:51.929
"G.O.B.," boys.

19:53.148 --> 19:54.193
Lee: Let's go.

19:56.586 --> 19:59.067
Come on, boy.

19:59.110 --> 20:01.069
You can't just sit around
lip-synching "Eye of the Tiger"

20:01.112 --> 20:02.375
while no one's watching.

20:04.812 --> 20:07.075
Come on. Get up here.

20:07.118 --> 20:09.077
-Yeah! Come on!

Woman: Stop! Stop!

22:25.518 --> 22:28.869
Hey. Hey!

22:28.912 --> 22:31.393
I think you fellas
have had enough.

22:33.439 --> 22:34.570
Time to leave.

22:34.614 --> 22:35.832
Nah.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.878
I think we'll stay
a while.

22:48.541 --> 22:50.717
Still got it.

22:54.460 --> 22:57.680
Lorna: Bunch of jerks.Woman: Yep.

22:57.724 --> 22:59.595
You alright, Sally?Dean: Sally?

22:59.639 --> 23:00.944
Sally Anderson?

23:00.988 --> 23:04.034
Yeah.

23:04.078 --> 23:05.384
Why?

23:15.089 --> 23:17.526
Castiel.Castiel: Sergei.

23:23.271 --> 23:28.972
Oh, the home of the fabled
Men of Letters.

23:32.454 --> 23:33.890
So the stories
are true.

23:33.934 --> 23:35.762
This place --

23:35.805 --> 23:37.938
what wonderful things
you must have.

23:37.981 --> 23:39.722
Okay, that's enough.

23:39.766 --> 23:42.725
You're here for a reason.

23:42.769 --> 23:44.771
Aren't we all?

23:52.343 --> 23:54.563
Help him. Please.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.826
'Course, my dear.

24:14.365 --> 24:16.324
Hmm.

24:16.367 --> 24:17.499
What?

24:17.543 --> 24:18.761
Small thing.

24:18.805 --> 24:19.806
What is it?

24:19.849 --> 24:22.591
Sam is...dying.

24:32.514 --> 24:36.039
She was a good girl,
you know?

24:36.083 --> 24:37.954
She --
she loved Jesus and --

24:37.998 --> 24:40.348
Lee: And --
and America, too.

24:42.176 --> 24:45.048
Sally, just --
just tell me what happened.

24:45.092 --> 24:48.312
We left B's
around closing.

24:48.356 --> 24:50.532
I was pretty hammered,

24:50.576 --> 24:55.145
but Angela,
she was helping me to her car

24:55.189 --> 24:58.148
when I needed...

24:58.192 --> 25:00.803
you know, I got sick.

25:00.847 --> 25:05.329
And when I was done,
she was gone.

25:05.373 --> 25:09.899
Angela was raptured,
and I was left behind.

25:09.943 --> 25:12.336
And the car went missing,
too, right?

25:12.380 --> 25:15.557
Yeah, it got raptured, too,
I guess.

25:15.601 --> 25:19.256
Y-You can't --
you can't rapture a car.

25:21.389 --> 25:23.434
It was a good car.

25:24.218 --> 25:26.829
Dean, can I talk to you
for a second, man?

25:30.224 --> 25:32.008
Lee: Man, come on.

25:32.052 --> 25:34.010
Her story, dude. I mean --I know, I know.

25:34.054 --> 25:35.577
Look, she's not
the most reliable witness,

25:35.621 --> 25:37.361
but -- but best friends
don't just up and leave

25:37.405 --> 25:39.538
without saying goodbye.Unless they deserve it.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.975
Yeah, but something
seems off here.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.412
I'll tell you what I'll do.

25:44.455 --> 25:45.848
I'll lock the joint up.

25:45.892 --> 25:48.285
You and I can work the case
just like old times.

25:48.329 --> 25:50.070
Great.
Yeah.

25:50.113 --> 25:51.724
Alright, well,
first things first,

25:51.767 --> 25:54.030
where do you, uh -- where do
you dump a car around here?

25:54.074 --> 25:56.424
Um, the lake maybe.

25:56.467 --> 25:57.904
Or the wrecking yard.

25:57.947 --> 25:59.253
Look, I don't want to know.

25:59.296 --> 26:00.602
I'm just saying,

26:00.646 --> 26:02.299
if I had
to get rid of something,

26:02.343 --> 26:03.866
Merle's is the place
I'd do it.

26:03.910 --> 26:06.869
I mean, that's --
I think the lake.

26:06.913 --> 26:08.915
Look, I'll check
the scrapyard, okay?

26:08.958 --> 26:10.699
You, you take the lake.

26:10.743 --> 26:12.092
Okay. Oh.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.969
What do you mean
he's dying?

26:20.013 --> 26:22.929
I imagine you were
trying to ascertain

26:22.972 --> 26:24.887
the exact nature of the wound
before this, yes?

26:24.931 --> 26:26.410
Yes.

26:26.454 --> 26:28.848
Ah, well,
there you go.

26:30.632 --> 26:33.809
Most wounds want to be healed,
to be whole.

26:33.853 --> 26:36.420
But this,
this wound is different.

26:36.464 --> 26:38.814
It goes down
to his very soul.

26:41.164 --> 26:44.298
But also
out into the world.

26:44.341 --> 26:47.083
From what I can tell,
his soul,

26:47.127 --> 26:52.001
it's connected to something
or someone somewhere.

26:52.045 --> 26:54.917
Except,
as you probed deeper,

26:54.961 --> 26:57.093
you forced the soul
to stretch

26:57.137 --> 26:58.921
from Sam's body to...

26:58.965 --> 27:00.444
Where?

27:00.488 --> 27:02.664
I don't know.

27:02.708 --> 27:06.929
But now
it's like a rubber band.

27:06.973 --> 27:09.671
If it is stretched too far,
too long,

27:09.715 --> 27:15.634
pop, it snaps,
and Sam dies.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.113
Can you fix it?

27:17.157 --> 27:18.985
Of course I can.

28:13.126 --> 28:14.997
Oh.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.956
Damn it.

28:20.263 --> 28:22.526
Couldn't leave well enough
alone, could ya?

28:35.801 --> 28:37.541
There.

28:37.585 --> 28:39.282
Done.

28:47.464 --> 28:48.901
And nothing's happening.

28:48.944 --> 28:50.250
Wait for it.

28:55.995 --> 28:57.736
Sam?

28:57.779 --> 28:59.389
Sam.

28:59.433 --> 29:01.565
Sam?

29:01.609 --> 29:03.567
You're not complete.

29:03.611 --> 29:06.309
You're not at full strength.

29:07.658 --> 29:08.921
What are you doing?

29:08.964 --> 29:10.531
I made it worse.

29:11.662 --> 29:14.753
You said he could die.Will die. And soon.

29:14.796 --> 29:17.625
You can't leave this world,
not without my help.

29:17.668 --> 29:19.366
No.

29:20.106 --> 29:22.586
That won't help.
It's already done.

29:23.674 --> 29:25.154
Unless.
What?

29:25.938 --> 29:27.853
You give me what I want.

29:32.379 --> 29:34.816
I used to be able to see
Sam and Dean in my head.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.122
And now it's just gone.

29:36.165 --> 29:37.427
And now it's just gone.

29:37.471 --> 29:38.951
And now it's just gone.

29:38.994 --> 29:40.517
Fix him,

29:40.561 --> 29:42.955
or I kill you.

29:42.998 --> 29:45.609
You kill me, he dies.

29:45.653 --> 29:50.484
Or you give me the Key to Death,
and he lives.

29:51.964 --> 29:54.270
What?

29:54.314 --> 29:55.794
You really have no idea

29:55.837 --> 29:58.840
about the treasures
this place holds, do you?

29:58.884 --> 30:01.930
The Men of Letters,
some time ago,

30:01.974 --> 30:05.194
procured
a very important item --

30:05.238 --> 30:06.935
a black key,

30:06.979 --> 30:09.720
handle in the shape
of a skeleton.

30:09.764 --> 30:13.289
It can open a door
to Death's library.

30:13.333 --> 30:16.640
You will find it
and give it to me, and --

30:16.684 --> 30:18.555
No.

30:18.599 --> 30:21.297
Castiel, please.

30:21.341 --> 30:22.821
You can't win this.

30:22.864 --> 30:25.475
Yes, I can.

30:30.611 --> 30:34.136
Anna.

30:34.180 --> 30:37.313
A friend, Bobby,
he's been watching her.

30:37.357 --> 30:38.967
And one word from me,

30:39.011 --> 30:41.752
and, well,
you know what happens.

30:44.886 --> 30:48.237
Fix Sam. Now.

30:49.891 --> 30:52.328
Now.

30:52.372 --> 30:57.072
Alnoth,
por Cantin Pre Tally Noth.

31:02.121 --> 31:04.993
Sam?

31:05.037 --> 31:06.908
Are you okay?

31:08.910 --> 31:10.390
I think.

31:10.433 --> 31:11.565
What about your wound?

31:12.609 --> 31:15.438
It's still there,
but he's back.

31:15.482 --> 31:16.700
So we good?

31:16.744 --> 31:18.877
For now.
Mm.

31:22.924 --> 31:25.274
I like this you, Castiel.

31:25.318 --> 31:28.408
It's very...Russian.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.225
Lee?

32:04.618 --> 32:05.836
Lee: You awake, buddy?

32:11.842 --> 32:14.758
The hell are you doing,
man?

32:14.802 --> 32:17.457
You had to hit the junkyard,
didn't you?

32:20.286 --> 32:23.463
Look, I don't know
what's going on, okay?

32:23.506 --> 32:25.247
But this is not you.

32:26.640 --> 32:30.949
Well, not the old me,
anyway.

32:32.559 --> 32:38.434
I wasn't kidding
about Arizona.

32:38.478 --> 32:43.439
What that thing did
to that family, those kids,

32:43.483 --> 32:47.269
it stuck in my head.

32:47.313 --> 32:49.619
If evil like that
exists in the world,

32:49.663 --> 32:52.318
then guys like you and me,
we ain't ever gonna win.

32:53.667 --> 32:55.669
The best we can do
is just have a little fun.

32:57.758 --> 32:59.629
The last Hunt I did,

32:59.673 --> 33:02.806
the one right around here,
I found something.

33:06.767 --> 33:08.987
It's called a marid.

33:09.030 --> 33:12.468
It's a freaky-looking
little thing, isn't it?

33:12.512 --> 33:14.122
Ah.

33:18.735 --> 33:22.304
As long as you feed it,
it gives you money,

33:22.348 --> 33:26.352
it gives you health,
everything you dreamed of.

33:26.395 --> 33:28.745
And so, what, it just costs
innocent lives?

33:28.789 --> 33:33.228
Dean, you and I both know
no one's innocent.

33:33.272 --> 33:36.579
After everything
we've done,

33:36.623 --> 33:39.234
aren't -- aren't we owed
a little happiness, huh?

33:39.278 --> 33:41.149
Don't we deserve
that much?

33:41.193 --> 33:42.368
Listen to yourself.

33:42.411 --> 33:45.849
"We're owed."
"We deserve."

33:45.893 --> 33:47.764
Come on, man.
You're not God.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.418
Hell,
God's not even God.

33:51.072 --> 33:54.075
Good or bad...

33:56.556 --> 33:58.427
...the world doesn't care.

33:58.471 --> 34:01.691
No one cares, Dean.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.563
Well, I do.

34:04.738 --> 34:08.524
Yeah.

34:08.568 --> 34:10.265
And that's
what got you here.

34:21.015 --> 34:24.975
Now, takes a while
to drain a man,

34:25.019 --> 34:26.281
but listen to me.

34:26.325 --> 34:27.935
Don't worry about it,
alright?

34:27.978 --> 34:30.807
Don't worry because
once you lose a couple of pints,

34:30.851 --> 34:33.288
you just fall asleep,

34:33.332 --> 34:34.942
and then it'll be over.

34:36.161 --> 34:38.467
Dean: Lee,This -- this is not

34:38.511 --> 34:40.121
how I wanted this to go,
Dean.

34:40.165 --> 34:43.733
When that blonde girl
walked in here last night,

34:43.777 --> 34:45.387
I should've know, you know,

34:45.431 --> 34:48.434
Dean Winchester,
the righter of wrongs,

34:48.477 --> 34:50.392
you were gonna keep digging,

34:50.436 --> 34:52.307
and you were gonna
figure me out.

34:54.527 --> 34:57.791
And if it's got to be
you or me,

34:57.834 --> 34:59.749
well, I got to pick me,
man.

35:05.277 --> 35:07.061
Lee.

35:10.804 --> 35:11.848
Lee!

36:39.240 --> 36:42.112
Sorry about your friend.

36:52.384 --> 36:53.863
Oh, God bless Texas.

37:15.842 --> 37:17.147
I'm out.

37:17.191 --> 37:19.106
And by my count,
so are you.

37:41.041 --> 37:42.564
You're hardcore,
brother.

37:42.608 --> 37:44.262
No.

37:44.305 --> 37:46.655
No, you don't get to pretend
like we're still friends.

37:46.699 --> 37:48.309
I don't know you.

37:48.353 --> 37:51.399
You don't, Dean?

37:51.443 --> 37:52.748
I am you.

37:52.792 --> 37:54.750
I'm just you that woke up

37:54.794 --> 37:56.622
and saw that the world
was broken.

37:56.665 --> 37:58.928
Then you fix it.

37:58.972 --> 38:00.582
You don't walk away.

38:00.626 --> 38:03.455
You fight for it.Right.

38:06.327 --> 38:09.112
What do you say we act like
this never happened, hm?

38:09.156 --> 38:12.028
Y-You just walk
out that door.

38:14.857 --> 38:17.295
I can't do that.

38:19.340 --> 38:20.559
You really
want to do this?

38:23.910 --> 38:26.304
No, I don't.

38:28.349 --> 38:29.959
But I kill monsters.

38:40.013 --> 38:42.363
You want a shot
at the title?

38:42.407 --> 38:44.060
Don't mind if I do.

39:18.704 --> 39:20.488
Ohh.

39:20.532 --> 39:23.491
Alright.

39:23.535 --> 39:25.841
I'll be damned.

39:28.540 --> 39:31.064
Why do you care so much,
Dean?

39:36.461 --> 39:39.246
Because someone has to.

39:41.727 --> 39:46.209
Well, then...

39:46.253 --> 39:48.429
I'm glad it was you.

39:55.654 --> 39:57.656
Wait, wait.

40:01.094 --> 40:03.575
Okay, okay.

40:31.037 --> 40:32.430
Dean: Hey.

40:33.996 --> 40:35.345
Dean.

40:35.389 --> 40:37.130
I got your message.
Sam, is he, uh --

40:37.173 --> 40:39.001
He's fine.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.963
Good. That's good.

40:46.139 --> 40:47.445
Yeah.

40:49.664 --> 40:51.100
Good.

40:51.144 --> 40:54.103
I feel like, uh...

40:54.147 --> 40:57.106
I feel like
I was in his head.

40:57.150 --> 40:59.761
You were
in Chuck's head?I think so.

40:59.805 --> 41:03.373
A-And I-I think
I-I saw his memories.

41:04.853 --> 41:06.855
Dean, Chuck is weak.

41:08.553 --> 41:10.163
I think we can beat him.

41:13.862 --> 41:16.648
I think we can beat God.
