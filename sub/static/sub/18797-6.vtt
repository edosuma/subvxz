00:00.010 --> 00:02.630
The gatherings were supposed
to be prayer evenings.

00:02.680 --> 00:04.550
There was a woman that drove us back.

00:04.600 --> 00:06.790
I think she was his wife or girlfriend.

00:06.840 --> 00:11.150
She remembers a blue Golf
convertible. What car did you drive?

00:11.200 --> 00:12.710
Maybe they were all at
one of these parties

00:12.760 --> 00:14.630
and maybe all three
involved in his murder.

00:14.680 --> 00:16.430
I don't think I'm good
for you any more, Maz.

00:16.480 --> 00:19.710
- I didn't kill that man.
- I'm gonna call Janet now

00:19.760 --> 00:22.270
- and ask for her help.
- 'Hi, I'm Martin.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.670
You had sex with my wife 20 years ago.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.830
Wondered if we could chat.'

00:26.880 --> 00:29.550
Oh, no. No.

00:29.600 --> 00:32.759
I'm pretty certain she was
at the party. I recognise her.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.670
Men took her places and used her.

00:37.720 --> 00:41.270
- Did David Walker do something
to you here, Sara? - No.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.710
What you said earlier about
nothing quite fitting --

00:43.760 --> 00:47.260
If I'm right, there are
gonna be more bodies.

So...

01:37.080 --> 01:40.440
what did he tell you, my dad?

01:41.680 --> 01:45.390
Enough for me to know if you...
never wanna talk about this again,

01:45.440 --> 01:47.440
and that's fine.

01:48.680 --> 01:54.310
Or if you wanna talk about it every
day for the rest of your life,

01:54.360 --> 01:56.360
that's fine, too.

02:03.200 --> 02:07.000
- I'm doing it properly.
- I know. I see you are.

02:15.280 --> 02:18.310
He was just very shocked
when I introduced myself.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.360
And scared.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.710
He was babbling and...

02:23.760 --> 02:27.760
kept repeating that it...
didn't mean anything.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.630
He kept on apologising.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.870
But I wasn't interested in apologies.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.920
I didn't want contrition.
What I wanted was...

02:39.080 --> 02:41.080
.. to understand.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.700
And the only person who
could help me do that...

02:47.920 --> 02:49.960
.. was dead.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.870
Does it ever cross your mind, Cath,

03:25.920 --> 03:28.920
that we've a very limited pot of money?

03:29.040 --> 03:31.870
And if we spend too much
on an incredibly expensive

03:31.920 --> 03:35.350
and time-consuming investigation
into 40-year-old abuse,

03:35.400 --> 03:38.840
then we've got nothing to spend on
a child that got abused last week.

03:40.360 --> 03:42.360
Yes, of course.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.360
And?

03:53.720 --> 03:55.350
Would you like to come through?

03:55.400 --> 03:59.270
And in terms of the bigger investigation,

03:59.320 --> 04:01.550
the murder investigation,
where are you with that?

04:01.600 --> 04:03.590
Don't know.

04:03.640 --> 04:07.390
They questioned me again yesterday,
but I have a watertight alibi.

04:07.440 --> 04:11.030
And this was that you were
sectioned in the Maudsley?

04:11.080 --> 04:13.070
26 years ago, yes.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.640
And for what it's worth, I
did not kill David Walker.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.589
OK.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.110
Well, I just hope I
have all the facts now.

04:23.160 --> 04:27.310
- I just need to consider how
best to proceed. - Yeah, of course.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.350
- How long do you think it will be?
- I don't know!

04:29.400 --> 04:31.830
I've never had to deal with
anything remotely like this.

04:31.880 --> 04:35.870
Sorry for snapping, but I'm...
I'm cross and disappointed.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.920
And Flo?

04:40.200 --> 04:43.470
- Erm... Simon, could you pick
her up from school today? - Yeah.

04:43.520 --> 04:48.510
OK, thank you. And Colin,
until I decide what to do,

04:48.560 --> 04:51.230
I need you to find somewhere
else to stay, please.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.270
Sure, sure.

04:53.320 --> 04:59.430
And if the investigation goes away,
then maybe we can get through this.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.710
If it drags on, if, God forbid,

05:01.760 --> 05:04.760
you were charged and it went to trial...

05:05.040 --> 05:07.230
we could obviously never
let you parent Flo.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.350
You'd either have to move our permanently

05:09.400 --> 05:13.630
and... we'd have to consider
Simon as a single parent,

05:13.680 --> 05:15.350
or if you both felt you couldn't do that,

05:15.400 --> 05:18.070
then we'd have to take her back.

05:20.120 --> 05:23.630
You know I would actually
get the boy's DNA tested

05:23.680 --> 05:27.630
if I thought it would help you,
but I know you know it's nonsense.

05:27.680 --> 05:31.030
You just wanted him gone,

05:31.080 --> 05:32.830
like me and Mum,

05:32.880 --> 05:36.710
so that he couldn't ask you any more
questions you didn't want to answer.

05:36.760 --> 05:40.080
But Mum and I are not going anywhere.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.120
I'm sorry.

05:44.480 --> 05:48.180
Anyway, come on. Do you
want another cup of tea?

05:56.200 --> 06:00.520
So, for over two weeks now, we've
all wrestled with this case.

06:01.600 --> 06:05.510
Following one... dead end after another.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.150
With the final nail in the coffin

06:07.200 --> 06:11.750
of the idea of Sara Mahmoud's
possible guilt... coming last night

06:11.800 --> 06:16.360
when her husband turned up
out of the blue with this.

06:18.280 --> 06:21.750
Evidence she was in Italy at
the time of Walker's death,

06:21.800 --> 06:23.590
which er.. was a blow

06:23.640 --> 06:26.710
because we know that Sara knew Walker.

06:26.760 --> 06:28.430
And I reckon if we hunted hard enough,

06:28.480 --> 06:33.270
we could conclusively place her
at a gathering Walker was at.

06:33.320 --> 06:36.230
Given also we know what Walker
liked to do to young girls,

06:36.280 --> 06:40.150
when he turns up at her flat
as a client eight years later,

06:40.200 --> 06:43.270
she has the perfect motive
for a revenge murder.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.990
Except the alibi is good.

06:45.040 --> 06:48.070
More than good. It's watertight.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.220
There's no way she could have killed him.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.470
Question is...

06:53.520 --> 06:55.910
is it too good?

06:55.960 --> 06:57.670
What, you think it's faked somehow?

06:57.720 --> 07:01.030
No. I think it's real.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.710
But what it feels like to me

07:02.760 --> 07:06.710
is a bunch of information
collected by a woman

07:06.760 --> 07:08.550
who knew she'd NEED an alibi.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.600
Which would mean...

07:11.720 --> 07:15.350
.. she'd have had to know
that Walker was going to die.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.400
Yes.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.350
OK, here goes.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.160
And erm...

07:24.320 --> 07:27.120
.. stop me when it gets too mental.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.750
So, we have three suspects

07:30.800 --> 07:35.070
who actually all have dysfunction
consistent with abusive childhoods.

07:35.120 --> 07:39.750
Er... drink issues, mental health
issues, relationship issues.

07:39.800 --> 07:44.670
We have three people who, for my money,

07:44.720 --> 07:47.840
just tried too hard to look
like they didn't know each other.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.070
And then we have an idea.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.470
That Sara Mahmoud was
abused by David Walker,

07:56.520 --> 07:59.030
but that Colin and Marion

07:59.080 --> 08:02.440
were abused by people
we've not yet identified.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.750
And that, at some point in early 1990,

08:06.800 --> 08:10.030
after Sara realises a client
is the same man who'd raped her

08:10.080 --> 08:12.070
at a gathering eight years before,

08:12.120 --> 08:16.830
three of them... already, I
believe, known to each other somehow,

08:16.880 --> 08:20.040
came together and hatched a plan...

08:20.800 --> 08:22.590
to murder all three of their abusers.

08:22.640 --> 08:25.710
Now, they knew if they
murdered their own abuser,

08:25.760 --> 08:29.600
there'd almost certainly be an
easily traceable link back to them.

08:31.160 --> 08:34.030
So they agreed to kill each other's.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.549
Sorry, Gov, if I'm being dim here,

08:38.600 --> 08:42.110
but erm... if you've
created the perfect alibi,

08:42.159 --> 08:45.110
why did Sara wait two weeks
before she gave it to us?

08:45.160 --> 08:48.630
Cos offering it up immediately
could also arouse suspicion.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.630
How much more credible for
her husband to find it.

08:51.680 --> 08:55.390
And you think Walker was the first victim?

08:55.440 --> 08:58.070
I think him turning up
as a punter at Sara's flat

08:58.120 --> 09:01.070
- was what kicked it all off.
- And he was killed by...?

09:01.120 --> 09:05.230
- Has to be Marion. Isn't it?
- I think so.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.510
Osborne was in the Maudsley,
Sara was in Italy.

09:07.560 --> 09:10.190
And Walker's body was
found less than eight miles

09:10.240 --> 09:12.190
from Marion's parents' house.

09:12.240 --> 09:15.190
So, why did Osborne spend so
much time with Walker, then?

09:15.240 --> 09:18.310
I think he was trying to confirm
that Walker was who Sara thought.

09:18.360 --> 09:23.270
So that has to mean Tara would have
had to kill... Colin Osborne's abuser

09:23.320 --> 09:25.870
and Osborne Marian's.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.120
Yes.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.430
And if we're right...

09:31.400 --> 09:34.670
.. to prove this theory, we'd
need to find three things.

09:34.720 --> 09:39.910
We'd need to find... evidence
of that historic connection,

09:39.960 --> 09:44.920
we'd need to find evidence of who
those other abusers might have been.

09:48.240 --> 09:51.180
And we'd need to find two more bodies.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.720
It won't be forever. It's fine.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.150
Give her a big kiss from me.

10:09.320 --> 10:12.920
Tell her I love her and
I'll be back very soon.

10:21.240 --> 10:23.190
Murray and Jake, we need to find out

10:23.240 --> 10:25.910
where our three suspects might have met.

10:25.960 --> 10:29.510
We know that two of them weren't
even in London till 1985,

10:29.560 --> 10:31.310
so we're looking at a meeting

10:31.360 --> 10:34.270
that happened somewhere
between then and 1990.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.830
Where might have that occurred?

10:36.880 --> 10:40.990
Was it through a job, party,
flat share, group counselling?

10:41.040 --> 10:44.270
I dunno. Think laterally. We'll be
focusing on the suspects' families.

10:44.320 --> 10:47.430
DCI Stuart will go to Glasgow to
talk to Colin Osborne's father,

10:47.480 --> 10:49.350
Fran will visit Sara Mahmoud's husband,

10:49.400 --> 10:52.430
- I'll visit Marion Kelsey's sister.
- We don't think they'll know a lot

10:52.480 --> 10:54.550
about what's been going
on the last few weeks,

10:54.600 --> 10:57.150
and if our suspects were abused,

10:57.200 --> 11:00.270
their families are our most
likely source of information.

11:00.320 --> 11:03.260
And how much do we actually tell them?

11:03.880 --> 11:05.950
We stop short of actually lying,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.750
but not by much, or we'll get nothing.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.190
We don't need these
interviews to be admissible.

11:11.240 --> 11:14.390
Right now, we just need to know
that we're on the right lines.

11:14.440 --> 11:18.120
So no appointments, no
warnings we're coming.

11:19.080 --> 11:22.080
We need to catch them on the back foot.

11:41.640 --> 11:44.720
- You don't need to say anything.
- Look, I...

11:45.600 --> 11:49.950
I just hope this doesn't affect
our work or our friendship.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.160
It won't. It hasn't, all right? I promise.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.790
Now piss off.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.590
They're trying to trace more
of the victims of the activities

12:31.640 --> 12:33.710
inside this Brentford
house, and if they do,

12:33.760 --> 12:36.590
they think they could support
the allegation you were present

12:36.640 --> 12:38.630
on at least one occasion.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.990
You're gonna be suspended from all duties

12:41.040 --> 12:42.910
whilst a full investigation takes place.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.920
I have to ask...

12:46.360 --> 12:48.750
.. if you did know what he was doing,

12:48.800 --> 12:51.740
how could you have not said anything?

12:57.160 --> 13:00.100
It sounds so inadequate, doesn't it...

13:01.040 --> 13:02.710
.. when you hear it on the news?

13:02.760 --> 13:05.760
People saying they were different times.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.070
But they were.

13:09.120 --> 13:13.390
There were times when a rock
star could... go on telly

13:13.440 --> 13:15.790
and be interviewed about
his underage girlfriend

13:15.840 --> 13:18.110
and no-one got arrested.

13:20.360 --> 13:23.400
We all just... shrugged it off.

13:25.160 --> 13:29.430
We thought it was sort
of... cheeky and amusing.

13:29.480 --> 13:33.960
We all bought into that, until we didn't.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.070
So that time, I followed him.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.030
And it was just the once.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.860
He told me she was 16.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.440
And willing.

14:04.480 --> 14:07.150
And he begged me to forgive him.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.440
And I wanted to.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.310
Both...

14:14.360 --> 14:17.080
forgive him and believe him.

14:18.760 --> 14:23.280
Because otherwise, it was
the end of our marriage...

14:25.080 --> 14:28.180
.. and everything we'd built up together.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.080
And so I did.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.760
And for that...

14:45.600 --> 14:47.740
.. I am truly ashamed.

15:00.840 --> 15:05.110
Well, Colin was a lively lad, you
know, when he was a little boy.

15:05.160 --> 15:08.270
He was full of mischief and fun.

15:08.320 --> 15:11.400
And then when he was about...

15:13.400 --> 15:15.390
.. nine...

15:15.440 --> 15:19.310
he just slowly started to change.

15:19.360 --> 15:23.950
Became quieter, you
know, more introverted.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.390
Staying in his room more,
not seeing his pals so much.

15:28.440 --> 15:32.790
And his... schoolwork suffered

15:32.840 --> 15:37.830
and he stopped being affectionate.
Got angry at the slightest thing

15:37.880 --> 15:39.950
and erm... he just...

15:41.880 --> 15:43.550
.. became a different child.

15:43.600 --> 15:47.350
And I presume you asked
him what was wrong?

15:47.400 --> 15:49.670
Over and over, for years.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.750
He would always just
say, 'Nothing. I'm fine.'

15:54.800 --> 15:57.790
So in the end, we just thought,
'Well, that's how he is.'

15:57.840 --> 16:00.110
That's how he was.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.150
That er...

16:02.200 --> 16:04.200
children change.

16:05.960 --> 16:09.430
And what you're talking
about -- sexual abuse --

16:09.480 --> 16:12.990
wasn't something that you
considered back in the '70s.

16:13.040 --> 16:18.310
It wasn't one of the options for
why a child isn't themselves.

16:18.360 --> 16:21.860
But if we consider it
as a possibility now...

16:22.600 --> 16:26.270
.. do you have any idea
where something like that

16:26.320 --> 16:28.030
could have happened to Colin?

16:28.080 --> 16:31.200
Were there ever any issues
in his primary school?

16:32.320 --> 16:35.710
No, I never heard of
anything like that there.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.350
Any friends or family?

16:38.400 --> 16:40.150
No.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.940
Was he a member of a church or...

16:44.360 --> 16:47.840
.. a football team or scout group or...?

16:52.160 --> 16:54.280
Mr Osborne.

16:56.320 --> 17:00.800
There was one bloke, a
pal from work, Len Paxton.

17:02.480 --> 17:08.280
He ran the local platoon
of... Club Rangers.

17:15.800 --> 17:20.470
I don't know why she seems
to hate me or hate our mum.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.950
Like I said, she's troubled.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.869
- Was it always like that?
- Absolutely not, no.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.430
We adored each other
when we were growing up.

17:29.480 --> 17:32.710
Do you remember when it
changed? Was it overnight or...?

17:32.760 --> 17:35.390
No, I remember exactly when it changed.

17:35.440 --> 17:38.310
I was 14

17:38.360 --> 17:40.350
and Marion was 11

17:40.400 --> 17:42.230
and we'd moved to Cork.

17:42.280 --> 17:44.830
Our dad had got a job as a lecturer there.

17:44.880 --> 17:48.150
You know, we had a great
house, a lovely garden.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.700
We even got our own
rooms for the first time.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.310
But Marion just... seemed to hate it.

17:55.360 --> 18:00.790
Overnight, she became...
distant, sullen, aggressive.

18:00.840 --> 18:03.670
- Towards you?
- Towards me, towards our mum,

18:03.720 --> 18:07.120
- at school, everyone.
- Including your dad?

18:07.480 --> 18:10.480
Actually, no, not Dad.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.590
But then, him and Marion
were always stupidly close.

18:14.640 --> 18:18.710
So, no, dad was the only
one who escaped her ire.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.630
When did your dad pass away?

18:20.680 --> 18:22.990
1991.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.480
- How old was he?
- 57.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.740
That sounds pretty young. Was he ill?

18:32.560 --> 18:35.880
- Why do you ask?
- Just trying to fill in the gaps.

18:37.400 --> 18:40.600
Well, no, he wasn't ill.
Well, not physically, anyway.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.110
He erm... took his own life.

18:46.280 --> 18:48.270
I'm sorry to hear that.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.590
Do you mind if I ask how?

18:51.320 --> 18:53.190
He hanged himself.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.070
Highgate woods.

18:55.120 --> 18:59.200
So did he have a history of
depression or mental illness or...?

19:00.440 --> 19:02.710
What are you suggesting?

19:03.800 --> 19:05.790
Did he?

19:05.840 --> 19:07.800
No.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.600
Right.

19:13.080 --> 19:15.820
Do you know if your mum's at home?

19:18.020 --> 19:22.090
Paxton? Don't recall the name Paxton.

19:22.140 --> 19:23.850
Before my time, probably.

19:23.900 --> 19:25.900
Really?

19:27.340 --> 19:30.130
- Sorry?
- Well, it's just erm...

19:30.180 --> 19:34.260
Well, I found him with a
simple Google search so...

19:35.340 --> 19:38.640
What are you asking me
about him for, then?

19:38.820 --> 19:42.970
Because I wanna know what happened
to him after he left prison in 1988

19:43.020 --> 19:46.370
for assaulting two boys
from a platoon in Dumfries.

19:46.420 --> 19:50.380
Look, this is all ancient history.

19:51.660 --> 19:56.370
Do you know, I am getting... really
pissed off with that expression

19:56.420 --> 20:00.330
because it's just not. The sort of
things people like Len Paxton did

20:00.380 --> 20:03.130
are still affecting people
today, catastrophically.

20:03.180 --> 20:08.210
It... fucks up whole lives, OK?

20:08.260 --> 20:11.130
So unless you want me to come back tonight

20:11.180 --> 20:13.210
when all the parents are here,

20:13.260 --> 20:17.860
I'd start trying a little harder
to remember, if I were you.

20:19.780 --> 20:22.020
He's dead.

20:24.420 --> 20:26.060
When?

20:27.140 --> 20:29.660
'92.

20:31.020 --> 20:33.010
How?

20:33.060 --> 20:36.000
He topped himself, everyone reckoned.

20:37.460 --> 20:40.010
- Reckoned?
- He had this little yacht

20:40.060 --> 20:42.530
he used to take some of the lads out on.

20:42.580 --> 20:44.850
It was found a few days
after he went missing,

20:44.900 --> 20:47.650
drifting in open water
off Greenock harbour.

20:47.700 --> 20:50.040
They never found his body.

20:50.780 --> 20:53.940
Although I'm not sure
anyone looked too hard.

21:00.340 --> 21:02.980
It's changed. We've changed.

21:04.140 --> 21:06.690
People like him don't slip
through the nets any more.

21:06.740 --> 21:08.970
Well, I really hope so.

21:09.020 --> 21:13.370
But they were saying that 30
years ago, and 20 and ten,

21:13.420 --> 21:17.570
and I just... fucking pray that they
won't be saying it 20 years from now

21:17.620 --> 21:19.620
about today.

21:28.180 --> 21:30.930
Her father told me what he'd found out

21:30.980 --> 21:34.980
- in the months after she ran away.
- This was while she was still 13?

21:36.100 --> 21:39.330
Them being taken to parties
organised by men like Walker

21:39.380 --> 21:41.650
and raped.

21:41.700 --> 21:44.650
Did he... not report this?

21:44.700 --> 21:46.690
Did he not go to the police?

21:46.740 --> 21:51.010
Yes. Apparently your lot told
him you couldn't do anything

21:51.060 --> 21:54.810
because it had been her choice
to become a child prostitute --

21:54.860 --> 21:58.660
a phrase it should be
fucking illegal to even use.

22:07.820 --> 22:09.700
Jesus.

22:11.420 --> 22:13.370
You knew.

22:13.420 --> 22:15.410
No.

22:15.460 --> 22:18.130
She told you. You knew!

22:18.180 --> 22:20.180
I did not know!

22:21.980 --> 22:27.050
She was always making things up,
Elise, exaggerating everything.

22:27.100 --> 22:29.610
Your father would never
have done the things --

22:29.660 --> 22:32.620
How old was she when she told you?

22:34.100 --> 22:36.490
You tell me now or I swear I'll...!

22:36.540 --> 22:39.100
Elise.

22:41.780 --> 22:44.060
- 12.
- Oh, my...!

22:50.620 --> 22:53.650
And you decided not to believe her

22:53.700 --> 22:57.010
because, what, you didn't
wanna lose the house

22:57.060 --> 23:01.290
or the research trips
abroad? Or because what?!

23:01.340 --> 23:04.580
You're a evil fucking witch!

23:08.220 --> 23:14.620
We... we have wondered all
our lives why she is so angry.

23:32.220 --> 23:37.260
I need you to tell me exactly
what Marion told you.

23:38.340 --> 23:40.340
Please.

23:43.300 --> 23:46.850
- What sort of a mother does that?
- I'm struggling to be charitable.

23:46.900 --> 23:49.330
Well, Osborne's dad clearly had no idea.

23:49.380 --> 23:52.690
Nor did Marion's sister. I guess
we've lost our element of surprise.

23:52.740 --> 23:55.930
- Pretty sure all three will know the
questions we've been asking. - Yeah.

23:55.980 --> 23:58.570
Which is why I wanna get in
front of Colin and Marion today

23:58.620 --> 24:01.090
- while they're still on the back foot.
- And ask them what?

24:01.140 --> 24:03.050
'Where they were when own abusers died.'

24:03.100 --> 24:06.490
Because if we're right, they'll
have absolutely watertight alibis.

24:06.540 --> 24:10.140
Which both proves the theory and
sort of screws us, evidentially.

24:10.980 --> 24:12.650
What have we got from Murray?

24:12.700 --> 24:17.050
So, he's spent all day
trawling NHS records.

24:17.100 --> 24:22.610
Turns out that at various
points in '87 and early 1988,

24:22.660 --> 24:24.850
both Colin and Sara were under the care

24:24.900 --> 24:27.900
of the Ealing Hospital psychiatric unit.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.450
- As inpatients? - Yeah.
- 'What about Marion?'

24:31.500 --> 24:34.650
'We haven't located her records
yet. But here's a thing.

24:34.700 --> 24:36.850
Before she lived at her Smoke Lane flat,

24:36.900 --> 24:42.260
from early '86 to late '87, she
lived in a flat in South Ealing.

24:44.860 --> 24:49.010
So that's the link. They met
in Ealing psychiatric unit.

24:49.060 --> 24:53.660
Well, it's gonna be hard to prove,
but it's got to be a possibility.

24:56.820 --> 24:58.500
Yeah.

24:59.700 --> 25:02.170
You track down Colin,
I'll speak to Marion.

25:02.220 --> 25:04.220
Thanks, Sunny.

25:05.980 --> 25:09.410
'The train now approaching
platform four will not stop here.'

25:09.460 --> 25:12.250
'Stand back from the
edge of platform four.'

25:12.300 --> 25:15.500
'The next train is not scheduled to stop.'

25:24.900 --> 25:26.240
Jason!

25:28.700 --> 25:30.740
How are you doing?

25:32.780 --> 25:35.140
Fancy a cuppa?

25:59.660 --> 26:02.890
Look... I know it's really annoying

26:02.940 --> 26:05.730
when people give you trite bits
of advice on how to be happy,

26:05.780 --> 26:09.930
but... you don't have to
be defined by your past.

26:09.980 --> 26:13.090
I had a horrible relationship
split a couple of years ago,

26:13.140 --> 26:15.980
then my mum died, and then my cat.

26:17.180 --> 26:21.290
And I was really struggling,
and then I met this bloke

26:21.340 --> 26:26.450
and I thought, 'God, he's nice.
He's not like other blokes.

26:26.500 --> 26:28.530
I'd love to get to know him better.'

26:28.580 --> 26:33.530
And it showed me that there
was possibility ahead.

26:33.580 --> 26:36.490
- Do you see?
- Yeah.

26:36.540 --> 26:38.620
Life goes on, Jase.

26:41.260 --> 26:44.850
Right, yeah, well, thanks for
that. And good luck with the bloke.

26:44.900 --> 26:47.620
Jase, the bloke's you.

26:50.180 --> 26:52.860
- What?
- It's you.

26:54.340 --> 26:56.530
I like you.

26:56.580 --> 27:00.090
- Really?
- Don't act so surprised.

27:00.140 --> 27:02.140
It's just erm...

27:03.580 --> 27:05.930
.. no-one's ever said that to me.

27:05.980 --> 27:08.770
So what I wanted to say was,

27:08.820 --> 27:11.690
shall we get that date in the diary?

27:19.380 --> 27:21.770
Marion, please don't go out now.

27:21.820 --> 27:25.330
I'm fine, honestly. Please don't
say anything to Tony just yet

27:25.380 --> 27:29.020
cos I need to speak to him myself.
OK? Back in a couple of hours.

27:30.140 --> 27:32.810
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

27:32.860 --> 27:36.100
And I am so, so sorry.

28:04.740 --> 28:07.290
- Sunny.
- Gov, Colin's not at his house.

28:07.340 --> 28:09.290
His husband said he'd moved out for a bit

28:09.340 --> 28:12.370
and was staying at a Holiday
Inn, but he's not there either.

28:12.420 --> 28:15.360
- 'Right.'
- Are you at Marion's yet?

28:15.420 --> 28:17.560
Er... no, no, not yet.

28:19.340 --> 28:21.100
I'll call you.

29:30.900 --> 29:34.770
They have no proof of anything,
Marion, and they never will have.

29:34.820 --> 29:36.410
But they know.

29:36.460 --> 29:38.530
But knowing something
and proving it in court

29:38.580 --> 29:41.120
are two very different things.

29:45.380 --> 29:47.380
Yeah, they are...

29:48.620 --> 29:50.560
.. very different.

29:54.620 --> 29:56.370
Marion.

29:56.420 --> 29:58.930
Where are you running to? It's over.

29:58.980 --> 30:01.210
So I wanna speak to my husband now, OK?

30:01.260 --> 30:04.180
Now I want to explain.

30:09.900 --> 30:12.930
Well, I was in Goa when
Paxton went missing.

30:12.980 --> 30:16.330
I have hotel and flight receipts.
I can prove I wasn't here.

30:16.380 --> 30:20.930
I'm sure. And when Marion's father died,

30:20.980 --> 30:24.380
can you prove you weren't
in Highgate woods?

30:25.180 --> 30:28.930
And did you meet them both
in Ealing psychiatric unit

30:28.980 --> 30:32.180
or... just Sara?

30:41.900 --> 30:43.650
I've read er...

30:43.700 --> 30:46.970
people... who've been abused

30:47.020 --> 30:49.820
can always recognise other victims.

30:50.500 --> 30:53.570
Something in the way
they carry themselves.

30:53.620 --> 30:55.620
Was it that...

30:56.820 --> 30:59.660
.. that drew you to each other?

31:03.700 --> 31:05.770
So I guess now you...

31:07.060 --> 31:08.770
.. pull what you have together

31:08.820 --> 31:11.250
and...

31:11.300 --> 31:13.410
present it to the CPS

31:13.460 --> 31:16.090
and... they may go for it

31:16.140 --> 31:18.880
and you may be able to charge us.

31:21.540 --> 31:24.850
But before you do, maybe I could
just give you some other facts.

31:24.900 --> 31:27.300
Please do.

31:28.940 --> 31:30.940
So...

31:32.620 --> 31:38.410
.. he used to come round to our
house on Sunday nights... mainly,

31:38.460 --> 31:41.250
for a roast dinner

31:41.300 --> 31:44.210
and he'd always find time to play with me.

31:44.260 --> 31:46.490
He'd pretend to be a horse

31:46.540 --> 31:49.770
and I'd climb on his back and
he'd buck and twist and turn,

31:49.820 --> 31:53.050
and I was a cowboy at a
bucking bronco contest,

31:53.100 --> 31:57.530
and I fucking loved him.
And when my dad found out

31:57.580 --> 32:00.850
that he ran the local Club Rangers platoon

32:00.900 --> 32:04.380
and suggested that I join,
I could not be happier.

32:05.620 --> 32:07.930
And for six months, it was
the best time of my life.

32:07.980 --> 32:12.010
We played football and kicked the
can and made fires in the woods

32:12.060 --> 32:13.730
and bows and arrows.

32:13.780 --> 32:15.770
It was...

32:15.820 --> 32:18.260
Enid Blyton for real.

32:20.780 --> 32:24.290
The first time it happened was when
we went camping for the weekend.

32:24.340 --> 32:28.770
My tent was an old army
one of my grandad's

32:28.820 --> 32:32.490
and when we started to put it up,
he said it wouldn't be any good

32:32.540 --> 32:36.260
because it wasn't waterproof
anymore and it was gonna rain.

32:37.300 --> 32:40.860
But that was OK, he said,
because he had room in his tent.

32:41.980 --> 32:45.170
That night, he only gave me a massage

32:45.220 --> 32:47.690
to help with the day's hike.

32:49.180 --> 32:53.460
The next night, he touched
me and asked me to touch him.

32:54.780 --> 32:57.520
It didn't rain that night either.

32:59.100 --> 33:03.580
I've spent a lifetime talking
to you about the shame and...

33:05.220 --> 33:07.210
.. guilt

33:07.260 --> 33:10.970
and how I thought I must have
actually wanted him to do it

33:11.020 --> 33:13.890
because sometimes I got an erection.

33:14.660 --> 33:17.570
And how I couldn't tell mum and
dad because he was their friend

33:17.620 --> 33:21.890
and I didn't wanna upset
them or embarrass anyone.

33:21.940 --> 33:23.570
And how I couldn't tell anyone else

33:23.620 --> 33:26.820
because he said I'd be sent away if I did.

33:28.580 --> 33:31.570
But I do still ask
myself every single day,

33:31.620 --> 33:34.090
'Why didn't I tell someone?'

33:38.740 --> 33:40.810
Then over the next...

33:42.300 --> 33:44.290
.. six months,

33:44.340 --> 33:47.980
on visits to our house
when my parents were out...

33:49.620 --> 33:52.090
.. he did... he did things...

33:56.500 --> 33:59.740
.. which actually physically
damaged me for life.

34:01.820 --> 34:03.650
Because a 48-year-old man

34:03.700 --> 34:07.900
is not meant to put himself
inside a nine-year-old boy.

34:09.300 --> 34:11.570
But much worse than the physical damage

34:11.620 --> 34:14.620
is the damage he did to me as a person.

34:16.020 --> 34:20.340
Because that first time, he
changed me instantly and forever.

34:22.020 --> 34:25.250
The drinking, the... rage,

34:25.300 --> 34:29.210
the suicide attempts, the
fighting, the manic working,

34:29.260 --> 34:31.409
the...

34:31.460 --> 34:35.889
endless, exhausting, visceral rage

34:35.940 --> 34:38.210
that I feel every day of my life,

34:38.260 --> 34:43.159
that I feel right at this moment,
having to explain this to you.

34:43.500 --> 34:45.900
That is all because of him.

34:50.699 --> 34:53.090
So you might put me in prison,

34:53.139 --> 34:55.330
but let me tell you this.

34:55.380 --> 35:00.340
You can't judge me unless
you've had it done to you.

35:02.180 --> 35:07.340
I won't ever, ever let anyone
judge me for what I did.

35:21.180 --> 35:26.250
And... and just so as you know,
what happened to Sara and Marion

35:26.300 --> 35:28.220
was much worse.

35:58.220 --> 36:00.210
Hiya.

36:00.260 --> 36:02.140
You OK?

36:08.460 --> 36:11.180
I need to tell you something.

36:27.740 --> 36:30.610
For a while, I wondered if
he only took the job in Cork

36:30.660 --> 36:33.090
because of the house,

36:33.140 --> 36:36.260
which meant that Elise and I
had our own rooms finally.

36:38.700 --> 36:42.650
First time, my mum was just downstairs.

36:42.700 --> 36:47.820
She was watching the Onedin Line
-- I... could hear the theme music.

36:49.700 --> 36:51.970
And he came in when my lights were out

36:52.020 --> 36:53.810
and he knelt by my bedside

36:53.860 --> 36:57.850
and he said that I was growing up now,

36:57.900 --> 37:00.130
becoming a young woman,

37:00.180 --> 37:02.810
and that soon I'd have boyfriends

37:02.860 --> 37:05.960
and he wanted me to be prepared for that.

37:06.620 --> 37:11.060
He wanted to help me, so
I knew how to enjoy it.

37:13.860 --> 37:16.900
And then he put his hand
under the covers and...

37:18.620 --> 37:21.490
.. he did what a boyfriend might do.

37:21.900 --> 37:25.850
And he did that pretty
much... every Saturday night

37:25.900 --> 37:28.700
when he was home, for about a year.

37:30.100 --> 37:33.300
And then one day, when
I was having my tea...

37:34.020 --> 37:38.450
I finally told my mum...
that he did things to me

37:38.500 --> 37:40.490
while she was downstairs.

37:40.540 --> 37:44.130
And I remember she was
peeling potatoes at the sink

37:44.180 --> 37:47.130
and... she never even stopped.

37:47.180 --> 37:50.610
She never turned to me,
she never said anything.

37:50.660 --> 37:55.050
And five minutes later, she
told me to go back upstairs

37:55.100 --> 37:57.090
and finish my homework.

37:57.140 --> 38:00.170
And I wondered at first if
she hadn't been listening,

38:00.220 --> 38:03.370
but then that night, she came upstairs

38:03.420 --> 38:06.090
and she stayed there, folding clothes

38:06.140 --> 38:10.660
and tidying... for an
hour after I went to bed.

38:11.940 --> 38:13.930
And...

38:13.980 --> 38:16.170
of course, he never came near me.

38:16.220 --> 38:18.250
And she did that for about six months

38:18.300 --> 38:21.100
and then one day, she just stopped.

38:22.180 --> 38:24.810
And then when she and my sister

38:24.860 --> 38:28.100
were out at the cinema
a few weeks later...

38:29.420 --> 38:32.160
.. he raped me for the first time.

38:33.340 --> 38:36.210
And I remember, I said to him erm...

38:37.820 --> 38:41.370
.. if he did the same to Elise and
he said, 'No, no.' It was just me.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.420
Cos I was special.

38:46.420 --> 38:48.420
I was special.

38:52.220 --> 38:55.370
And the anger, Tony, the anger
I felt for so many years,

38:55.420 --> 38:57.420
and I still do....

39:02.140 --> 39:05.440
In the end, it made me
do a terrible thing.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.220
Hey.

39:31.900 --> 39:33.900
Hiya.

39:36.180 --> 39:37.860
How are you?

39:38.900 --> 39:41.730
He sent me that.

39:41.780 --> 39:44.730
- Who did?
- Him.

39:44.780 --> 39:46.410
Your mother's lover.

39:46.460 --> 39:50.300
It's the letter she wrote, telling
him why she was finishing with him.

39:51.220 --> 39:55.340
How she realised that what
we had was what she wanted.

39:56.660 --> 40:00.160
How terrible she felt
about what she'd done...

40:01.260 --> 40:06.940
.. and how the affair made her
realise how much she loved me.

40:10.220 --> 40:15.060
It's a good letter...
to read, Cass, for me.

40:16.820 --> 40:19.690
It's very good for me to know about.

40:20.140 --> 40:22.140
Mm.

40:32.700 --> 40:35.900
You wouldn't have got it if you
hadn't gone to see him, Dad.

40:41.340 --> 40:43.540
So you were right. You.

40:58.700 --> 41:01.900
Listen, I've just gotta make a quick call.

41:03.100 --> 41:05.090
I love you, Dad.

41:05.140 --> 41:06.860
Just er...

41:08.300 --> 41:10.370
.. I'll be quick.

41:25.860 --> 41:28.020
- 'Sunny?'
- Hey.

41:29.900 --> 41:32.380
Can you meet me?

41:35.060 --> 41:36.930
This case rests on them
knowing each other.

41:36.980 --> 41:39.850
Without conclusive proof
of that, it is just a theory

41:39.900 --> 41:41.810
and they're not gonna confess.

41:41.860 --> 41:44.930
Without any bodies, it's
gonna be... very hard

41:44.980 --> 41:47.920
to connect any of them to the deaths.

41:48.460 --> 41:52.010
So I can't see the CPS being
delirious to press charges.

41:52.060 --> 41:54.050
But we do have proof now.

41:54.100 --> 41:57.530
I mean, you just told me
you saw them together.

41:57.580 --> 41:59.580
I saw them...

42:01.020 --> 42:02.970
.. on my own.

42:03.020 --> 42:05.460
CCTV or...?

42:07.180 --> 42:09.650
And they arrived separately.

42:10.620 --> 42:12.290
Fuck.

42:12.340 --> 42:14.820
'Yeah, fuck.'

42:19.860 --> 42:21.860
'Well...'

42:23.300 --> 42:26.970
.. I guess in the end, you have
to ask yourself the old question.

42:27.020 --> 42:29.690
Why do we send people to prison?

42:31.460 --> 42:34.140
And do Colin, Sara and Marion...

42:37.980 --> 42:40.970
.. need to be deterred from
committing murder again?

42:41.020 --> 42:43.980
- No.
- No, I don't think so.

42:46.380 --> 42:48.370
So...

42:48.420 --> 42:50.530
do they need to be rehabilitated?

42:50.580 --> 42:53.330
I mean, for the last 20 years at least,

42:53.380 --> 42:57.250
they've all been very
valuable members of society.

42:57.300 --> 43:00.620
All three of them helping
the most vulnerable.

43:03.500 --> 43:05.500
'Which means...

43:07.260 --> 43:10.500
.. in the end, it pretty much
comes down to punishment.

43:11.580 --> 43:14.170
Do Colin, Sara and Marion
need to be punished?'

43:14.220 --> 43:18.010
'And that's it, you see, because for me,

43:18.060 --> 43:21.210
I think their whole
lives have been one long,

43:21.260 --> 43:23.650
indescribably brutal punishment,

43:23.700 --> 43:28.020
and I just can't see why we
would punish them further.

43:29.740 --> 43:32.340
I can't see who would benefit.'

43:34.300 --> 43:37.530
No, no, nor can I.

43:37.580 --> 43:39.730
OK.

43:39.780 --> 43:41.780
So...

43:43.700 --> 43:47.810
.. this is... significant.

43:47.860 --> 43:51.370
Sunny, this is a pretty fucking
huge thing I would do here.

43:51.420 --> 43:53.850
- You?
- Yeah.

43:53.900 --> 43:55.690
To be absolutely clear, this is just me.

43:55.740 --> 43:58.170
You would never be implicated
in any decision I make.

43:58.220 --> 44:01.210
But if you have a single shred
of doubt, please tell me now.

44:01.260 --> 44:03.770
Tell me to see Andrews first
thing tomorrow morning,

44:03.820 --> 44:07.820
report everything, tell him
I saw them all together.

44:20.980 --> 44:23.980
I don't believe they could be charged...

44:24.820 --> 44:27.530
.. and I see no point in
disrupting their lives further,

44:27.580 --> 44:30.090
so... no,

44:30.140 --> 44:33.540
I won't tell you to do that.

44:42.620 --> 44:44.370
You're all right.

44:44.420 --> 44:46.290
Do you know that?

44:47.460 --> 44:49.860
You're not so bad yourself.

44:53.340 --> 44:55.770
I'm gonna leave now before
you try and snog me.

44:55.820 --> 44:57.900
Smart move.

45:09.860 --> 45:11.730
Na-night, Sunny.

45:11.780 --> 45:13.660
Night, Gov.
