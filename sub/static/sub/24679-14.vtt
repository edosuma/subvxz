00:01.435 --> 00:03.972
In New York City's war on crime,

00:04.037 --> 00:06.313
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:06.373 --> 00:08.943
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.920
These are their stories.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.320
I quit years ago.

00:17.384 --> 00:19.990
Watching my old man die
of lung cancer cured me.

00:20.053 --> 00:23.000
I'll see what shows up on the blood tests.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.901
Thank you, Mr. Gergis.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074

00:41.441 --> 00:43.216
I did okay, huh?

00:43.277 --> 00:44.415
Sure.

00:46.747 --> 00:50.251
You remember, you call me
every couple of weeks.

00:50.317 --> 00:52.695
You let me know how you're doing.

00:53.620 --> 00:54.894
Not here.

00:56.123 --> 00:58.160
Wait till you get outside.

01:12.272 --> 01:14.775
Tell Elaine it's for her.

01:15.876 --> 01:18.117
Leo, where did you get this?

01:18.178 --> 01:21.091
I earned it from medical research.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.192
They took my blood.

01:23.283 --> 01:26.890
Hey, they paid me $1,000.

01:31.658 --> 01:35.834
Ben, I got my ring out of hock.

01:37.464 --> 01:40.877
Hey, tell Elaine all I want is a chance, huh?

01:43.303 --> 01:45.909
I gotta tap a kidney. You wait for me?

01:53.013 --> 01:54.993
What are you doing here?

01:55.148 --> 01:57.492
I wanted to see you, Ricky.

01:57.551 --> 01:58.962
I don't have your number.

01:59.019 --> 02:01.499
It's a nice cologne, Dad.
Look, if you're looking for money...

02:01.555 --> 02:05.503
No, no, Ricky, no. Here.

02:07.227 --> 02:08.729
It's not much.

02:09.329 --> 02:11.639
I'm gonna make things up to you.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.412
Okay, look,

02:17.137 --> 02:20.118
catch up with your friends,
treat them to a slice,

02:20.173 --> 02:22.653
and get yourself a CD or something.

02:27.214 --> 02:30.161
Another chance with $300?

02:30.317 --> 02:32.923
Do you know that he showed up
at Rick's campus today?

02:32.986 --> 02:36.160
What happens if he decides
to visit Emmy at her school?

02:37.257 --> 02:39.669
He's my brother. I'll tell him to back off.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.865
You tell him that if he
comes near the kids again,

02:41.928 --> 02:44.340
I'm gonna have him thrown in jail.

02:44.731 --> 02:46.335
What should I do?

02:46.400 --> 02:48.971
I wanna come home, Ben.
I wanna take care of her.

02:49.036 --> 02:51.676
Well, you got nothing to offer, Leo.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.513
Why don't you hit up those researchers?

02:56.576 --> 02:59.523
Well, if they can afford one grand,
they can afford 10, it's...

03:02.749 --> 03:04.751
I'll see you around, Leo.

03:08.288 --> 03:09.494
Oh, hi.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.161
I thought I got the address wrong.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.035
Sorry I had to bother you.

03:16.096 --> 03:18.599
Hey, well, that makes two of us, buddy.

04:06.546 --> 04:09.459
Morning shift found him crushed in here.

04:09.516 --> 04:13.020
He tried to slip through
and then the gate opened.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.300
Well, didn't anyone hear him scream?

04:18.358 --> 04:20.269
The gate's pretty loud.

04:23.864 --> 04:26.845
(GATE RATTLING)

04:29.336 --> 04:31.748
Hey, one of you guys got the time?

04:32.038 --> 04:33.346
8:30.

04:33.573 --> 04:35.314
They heard you just fine.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.983
Maybe, they didn't hear him
scream because he didn't scream,

04:42.015 --> 04:44.120
'cause he was already dead.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.892
RODGERS: Latent ID'd him as Leo Gergis, 48.

04:50.357 --> 04:53.201
He has a record of panhandling and vagrancy.

04:54.060 --> 04:56.597
There's a preliminary
finding of accidental death.

04:56.663 --> 04:59.041
The gate caught him on the
right side of the head,

04:59.099 --> 05:01.636
but most of the trauma is on the left.

05:01.701 --> 05:04.272
Look at this. St. Victor's.

05:04.337 --> 05:05.748
The homeless shelter in Brooklyn.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.286
It's a long way from Hunts Point.

05:09.342 --> 05:10.844
He was married.

05:15.482 --> 05:18.929
There's... There's no tan line on his finger.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.830
Maybe he just started wearing it.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.934
The gold is tarnished.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.530
There's a thin line across the band.

05:31.798 --> 05:33.300
Someone tied a string around it.

05:33.366 --> 05:36.176
Maybe a pawnbroker's tag.

05:36.703 --> 05:39.684
Somehow he had the money
to get it out of hock.

05:40.807 --> 05:43.617
You know, when you live in a shelter,

05:44.077 --> 05:47.524
you learn not to hide things

05:49.082 --> 05:52.825
in your socks, your pockets, your pants.

06:02.662 --> 06:05.643
You know, I've always wanted a jacket like that.

06:06.099 --> 06:09.410
Well, maybe we can find out
where Leo got his.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.147
How did it happen?

06:12.205 --> 06:15.345
We're not sure. Had you seen him recently?

06:15.475 --> 06:17.682
No, no, well, not since he crashed

06:17.744 --> 06:20.054
my son's high school graduation.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.421
When they found him, he was wearing this.

06:24.484 --> 06:26.293
Do you recognize it?

06:26.519 --> 06:30.262
Yeah. He was wearing this?

06:33.260 --> 06:36.173
Did he have any reason to think
you were getting back together?

06:36.229 --> 06:38.641
No, I didn't give him any.

06:39.432 --> 06:41.002
How about you, Mr. Gergis?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.774
Did your brother say anything to you?

06:42.836 --> 06:45.976
Well, a couple of weeks ago,
he gave me $300 for Elaine,

06:46.039 --> 06:48.144
and he gave my nephew $100.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.586
He thought he could buy his
way back into the family.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.624
We found another $500 on him.

06:52.679 --> 06:54.716
You have any idea where he got that money?

06:54.781 --> 06:57.091
BEN: He said something about giving blood.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.555
Well, you don't make that
kind of money selling blood.

06:59.619 --> 07:01.360
Well, then I don't know!

07:01.421 --> 07:04.061
He... Maybe he had some scam going.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.730
He used to be marketing
director for a cruise line.

07:06.793 --> 07:08.966
He... He was no idiot.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.633
He couldn't take care of his family,

07:10.697 --> 07:13.610
but he damn well took care of his own needs.

07:18.571 --> 07:20.346
CHESTER: We hold their stuff for 3 months

07:20.407 --> 07:22.546
and then it goes to Goodwill.

07:22.609 --> 07:27.058
Here's Leo's stuff. Oh, sorry, here.

07:27.347 --> 07:30.055
Oh, no, that's okay. I'm better without.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.863
Leo knew his mustard.

07:35.922 --> 07:38.698
These look like they're from a hotel.

07:41.494 --> 07:42.871
Well, he bought these.

07:42.929 --> 07:45.068
Tax stamps are still on them.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.378
Maybe he bought them for a friend.

07:48.902 --> 07:53.146
I mean, there was no nicotine
on Leo's fingers or his teeth.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.646
He doesn't smoke.

07:58.278 --> 08:01.259
Leo's buddies, any of them smoke this brand?

08:01.314 --> 08:06.229
Filtered, yeah. There's Johnny,
Johnny Dikins.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.997
I haven't seen him here in a month.

08:10.056 --> 08:12.093
He left his stuff behind.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.171
John Dikins, age 45.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.870
DOA a month ago. Finding of accidental death.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.412
Next time, call first.

08:21.468 --> 08:23.072
I'm supposed to be on my lunch break.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.706
You get a lunch break?

08:25.205 --> 08:27.879
All right, he fell through the
floor of an abandoned building.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.421
Autopsy found blunt force
trauma to the second

08:30.477 --> 08:31.854
and third vertebrae.

08:31.911 --> 08:34.289
Broken neck. Do it to you every time.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.917
Apparently, so does being homeless.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.586
Two deaths by blunt force trauma

08:37.650 --> 08:39.652
consistent with freak accident.

08:39.719 --> 08:43.462
Yeah, and two victims in their
late 40s, both in good health.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.834
How many cases with this
profile in the last 12 months,

08:50.897 --> 08:53.434
in all five boroughs, men and women?

08:54.100 --> 08:55.943
EAMES: Here's another.

08:57.470 --> 09:00.314
Death from accidental overdose, pass.

09:02.809 --> 09:05.153
Death from exposure, pass.

09:08.415 --> 09:12.329
Here we go. Lisa Fitterman,
female, Caucasian,

09:12.385 --> 09:14.922
slip and fall down the stairs
at 59th Street station.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.730
Head injuries, 46-year-old vagrant.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.965
(SIGHING)

09:23.263 --> 09:24.799
That's 14.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.404
Right. Yeah.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.510
Fourteen homeless people.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.381
Male, female, all Caucasian,

09:34.607 --> 09:37.383
all between the ages of 45 and 55.

09:39.979 --> 09:43.552
All in, you know, reasonably good health.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.821
All of them dead

09:46.886 --> 09:50.663
from injuries that include
a massive blow to the head.

09:52.492 --> 09:55.439
Someone's killing the great bums of New York.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.911
There's a call on your direct line.

09:59.966 --> 10:02.970
He said it's about a
client, someone named Leo.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.917
Jack Bernard. How can I help you?

10:12.879 --> 10:14.324
I'm not sure I can do that.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.485
I have associates. I'll talk to them.

10:16.549 --> 10:19.291
I... No, you give me a number.

10:19.352 --> 10:22.265
I... Just... Hello?

10:30.396 --> 10:32.137
I'll be back in 10.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.915
Nothing's jumping out.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.818
The deaths were already factored
into the Compstat mortality report.

10:43.877 --> 10:46.824
If there was a pattern, the
computer would've picked it up.

10:46.946 --> 10:49.620
Well, maybe not. These deaths
are scattered across precincts.

10:49.682 --> 10:53.255
Sometimes 2 weeks apart, sometimes 2 months.

10:53.453 --> 10:56.059
Different times, different days of the week.

10:56.122 --> 10:58.124
I don't see a motive here.

10:58.591 --> 11:01.003
If it's random, maybe
it's because it is random.

11:02.929 --> 11:07.901
If these were random, the law of
averages says there'd be coincidences

11:08.334 --> 11:10.280
with the times or the locations.

11:10.336 --> 11:13.715
The fact there are no coincidences
means somebody's working very hard

11:13.773 --> 11:16.117
at not setting off alarm bells.

11:16.242 --> 11:17.846
Leo is your freshest trail. Start with him.

11:17.911 --> 11:18.912
In the works.

11:18.978 --> 11:20.924
We're tracking the lot
numbers on the mustard jars

11:20.980 --> 11:22.391
in his knapsack.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.297
Sophia, these detectives wanna talk to you

11:27.353 --> 11:29.526
about the needle you found
in Mr. Gergis' trash.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.697
It was very small,

11:33.393 --> 11:35.703
with a little rubber tube on it.

11:35.762 --> 11:38.299
Sounds like the kind
used to take blood samples.

11:38.665 --> 11:40.804
Did you find anything else in the trash?

11:41.834 --> 11:44.371
There was these sticky square things

11:44.637 --> 11:47.516
and little strips of paper.

11:49.809 --> 11:51.686
Electrocardiogram.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.687
Leo had a physical.

11:55.515 --> 11:58.894
Now why would somebody get a
physical in a hotel room?

12:05.124 --> 12:07.764
GOREN: Now, we ran all 14 victims

12:07.827 --> 12:10.535
through the insurance
Medical Information Bureau.

12:10.597 --> 12:12.770
They were all insured for a million bucks

12:12.832 --> 12:14.709
under "keyman" policies.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.979
The Atlantic Union Insurance
Company, they thought

12:18.037 --> 12:20.881
that they were insuring the
vice president of finances

12:20.940 --> 12:23.784
for Compagnie Fiduciaire Elysée of France.

12:26.079 --> 12:29.151
Trans-State Insurance thinks Johnny
was the director of marketing

12:29.215 --> 12:32.719
for Compagnie Immobiliére Concorde in Paris.

12:32.785 --> 12:35.095
Somebody passed them off
as corporate honchos.

12:35.154 --> 12:38.692
Working for French companies that are
the beneficiaries of the policies.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.238
Let me guess. The companies were bogus.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.706
Yeah, someone is recruiting these people,

12:43.763 --> 12:45.436
cleaning them up,

12:45.531 --> 12:46.771
and getting them a checkup.

12:46.833 --> 12:49.370
And then when the policy is enforced,

12:49.502 --> 12:51.778
they kill them to look like an accident.

12:51.838 --> 12:55.149
At a million bucks a pop, why
didn't the insurers notice a trend?

12:55.375 --> 12:59.323
Well, the scheme was designed
to avoid detection by using

12:59.379 --> 13:02.292
different underwriters and
actuaries, submitting policies

13:02.348 --> 13:04.350
under brokers' names without their knowledge.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.556
Yeah, I wonder how many
homeless are walking around

13:06.619 --> 13:08.155
with a price on their head.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.167
Find out while you can still
do something about it.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.759
This perp must have left tracks.

13:11.824 --> 13:15.533
We don't know enough about
insurance companies,

13:15.595 --> 13:18.235
so they're sending us an expert.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.593
You play the piano, Mr. Stevens?

13:43.256 --> 13:44.963
Your fingers...

13:47.827 --> 13:49.500
I taught myself.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.735
Moving my fingers like this relaxes me.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.110
Your work makes you tense?

13:54.167 --> 13:57.808
It stimulates me, looking for fraud,

13:57.870 --> 13:59.781
looking for falsehoods.

13:59.872 --> 14:02.079
They always betray themselves.

14:02.575 --> 14:06.887
The man you're looking for got
his training at Hartford State.

14:07.213 --> 14:10.660
You figured that out just by
glancing at this material?

14:12.185 --> 14:15.428
So he learned something at Hartford State

14:15.488 --> 14:18.697
that he used to commit the crimes.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.667
Maybe he took classes in statistics.

14:26.733 --> 14:29.543
Colonial New England sponsors
a course in actuarial studies

14:29.602 --> 14:31.138
at Hartford State.

14:31.204 --> 14:35.084
The instructor uses an idiosyncratic
approach to probability analysis.

14:35.141 --> 14:38.611
Your man used that approach to
manipulate the variables of each crime

14:38.678 --> 14:40.419
to avoid detection.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.191
These four, what's the common thread?

14:51.224 --> 14:55.036
Well, he's familiar with
industrial insurance.

14:55.094 --> 14:58.541
These cases, Dikins and Sher,

14:58.598 --> 15:01.943
displayed proprietary knowledge
specific to two insurers,

15:02.001 --> 15:04.447
Ohio Mutual and National Colonial.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.313
Our man worked for one of them.

15:06.372 --> 15:08.249
Or it's a coincidence.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.513
Well, no such thing. No.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.284
The more intricate the apparent pattern,

15:13.346 --> 15:15.121
the simpler the underlying reality.

15:15.181 --> 15:16.922
Chaos Theory.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.631
What else can you see?

15:25.792 --> 15:28.068
He did a stint with an international firm.

15:28.127 --> 15:30.368
Because he knew how

15:31.631 --> 15:35.101
to file incorporation papers for
the phony French companies.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.340
Yes.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.117
This is really great.

15:41.340 --> 15:44.753
That completes his skill set.
Other than that,

15:46.179 --> 15:47.817
I can't help you.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.562
Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

16:03.362 --> 16:07.504
I didn't know you had
an older, geekier brother.

16:13.539 --> 16:14.813
How was your flight?

16:14.874 --> 16:18.617
Turbulent. Everything connected
with this business is turbulent.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.214
It's dishwater.

16:22.849 --> 16:25.295
Will you tell me why you need this?

16:29.455 --> 16:33.164
We're not involved in each other's
private business anymore.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.270
You made the rules, remember?

16:46.806 --> 16:49.286
This guy worked for Ohio
Mutual from '88 to '93.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.686
Specialized in employee benefits.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.281
He interned at Lloyd's of London in the '70s.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.384
Now, that's two markers.

16:57.116 --> 17:00.359
That's it. Two out of five markers.

17:00.419 --> 17:02.865
Maybe there are no perfect matches.

17:03.256 --> 17:07.829
Maybe there are two people who
together have the required skill set.

17:09.262 --> 17:12.300
Maybe I'm starting to sound
like your little buddy.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.371
There is one marker
that Wally Stevens forgot.

17:18.271 --> 17:21.115
That not only did our guy
recruit homeless people,

17:21.173 --> 17:24.676
he had to find them again
when it was time to kill them.

17:25.176 --> 17:26.520
Now,

17:26.811 --> 17:29.452
that wouldn't be easy unless
you worked with the homeless.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.495
Insurance guys love
to give each other awards,

17:31.551 --> 17:34.054
especially for their humanitarian work.

17:34.120 --> 17:38.000
Their trade association newsletter
might have something about it.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.601
The Dominion Award for Civic Action.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.732
Looks like there are 3
people in the last 10 years

17:43.796 --> 17:45.275
who won for their work with the homeless.

17:45.331 --> 17:48.744
This guy looks old enough to be
Wally's grandfather. But this guy,

17:48.801 --> 17:49.973
he looks in good shape.

17:50.036 --> 17:53.210
He might know his way around
a blunt instrument.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.616
Jack Bernard.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.778
Now, he sounds familiar.

17:57.843 --> 17:59.345
He got the award five years ago,

17:59.412 --> 18:01.756
"For tireless efforts
on behalf of the homeless."

18:02.348 --> 18:04.123
Back then, he worked for National Colonial.

18:04.183 --> 18:05.992
That's one of the companies Wally mentioned.

18:06.052 --> 18:07.156
That's two markers.

18:07.219 --> 18:08.357
Three.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.401
He grew up in Hartford,
went to Hartford State.

18:10.456 --> 18:12.493
He's gonna wish he stayed.

18:15.661 --> 18:17.004
(BANGING ON DOOR)

18:17.063 --> 18:19.168
Mr. Bernard, it's the police.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.109
There's a light on around back.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.053
Gas.

18:39.552 --> 18:42.192
There's somebody on the floor in there.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.333
(COUGHING)

19:10.149 --> 19:11.719
He's dead.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.635
According to his passport, he
hasn't been out of the country

19:18.691 --> 19:20.466
in 3 years. I don't see how he picked up

19:20.526 --> 19:22.528
those insurance checks in Paris.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.235
Yeah, this room doesn't fit.

19:27.233 --> 19:29.008
He's got this expensive furniture

19:29.068 --> 19:31.810
and then these cheap posters on the wall.

19:31.871 --> 19:35.284
I mean, look at this stereo.
What's that worth? Maybe $150.

19:35.341 --> 19:38.879
And then this dining room set is worth

19:39.645 --> 19:40.988
about $10,000.

19:41.047 --> 19:44.187
Maybe he has a friend
in the furniture business.

19:46.652 --> 19:50.293
Well, all this stuff is from
Faubourg Saint-Louis showroom.

19:51.257 --> 19:55.069
Maybe his friend in the
furniture business is French.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.701
JEANNE-MARIE: I haven't worked for
that furniture company in two years.

20:01.767 --> 20:03.713
Why are you bothering me
with this ancient history?

20:03.769 --> 20:06.545
You were personnel director
until they fired you.

20:06.605 --> 20:08.209
I was not fired.

20:08.808 --> 20:12.381
No, see, the company said
they fired you two years ago

20:12.445 --> 20:15.824
for taking kickbacks from an
insurance broker, Jack Bernard.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.122
All these ridiculous accusations.

20:18.184 --> 20:22.189
Have you ever heard of the
Compagnie Fiduciaire Elysee?

20:22.688 --> 20:24.827
No, must be your pronunciation.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.426
Yeah, it must be,

20:26.492 --> 20:28.597
because the Interpol found your fingerprints

20:28.661 --> 20:30.663
on incorporation papers

20:31.363 --> 20:33.036
from that company.

20:34.633 --> 20:37.546
Your client and Mr. Bernard
took their initial scam

20:37.603 --> 20:39.708
and kicked it up a couple notches.

20:39.772 --> 20:43.982
They insured homeless people as key
executives of bogus French companies

20:44.043 --> 20:47.286
and then they killed them
for the insurance money.

20:51.817 --> 20:53.262
(BOTH WHISPERING)

20:56.856 --> 20:59.666
My client denies any
complicity in this scheme.

20:59.725 --> 21:02.137
But she may know of other victims

21:02.194 --> 21:05.903
that Mr. Bernard has insured and is
planning on killing in the future.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.410
How many? Un? Deux? Trois?

21:16.809 --> 21:17.913
Deux.

21:19.712 --> 21:23.888
Well, we certainly don't want Mr.
Bernard killing any more people.

21:25.184 --> 21:27.130
Let's hear her story.

21:27.219 --> 21:28.789
Off the record.

21:30.389 --> 21:33.097
I didn't know Jack was going
to kill anyone, okay?

21:33.159 --> 21:36.333
He didn't explain it to me until
after the first person died,

21:36.395 --> 21:38.466
and then I was afraid. I had to go along.

21:38.531 --> 21:39.805
Yeah, I can imagine.

21:39.865 --> 21:41.276
It's true. He picked the victims.

21:41.333 --> 21:42.710
He decided when to kill them.

21:42.768 --> 21:45.112
And what, you just held his coat?

21:45.638 --> 21:47.276
I just set up the companies.

21:47.339 --> 21:51.617
I collected the checks, and I kept the
policies in a deposit box. That's it.

21:52.645 --> 21:56.593
$14,000,000. $14,000,000!

21:57.082 --> 21:58.493
Where is it?

21:59.084 --> 22:01.291
Supposed to be in a bank in the Caymans,

22:01.353 --> 22:03.333
but Jack emptied all the accounts.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.463
He ripped me off.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.801
So why is it that you think he
is the one who took the money?

22:11.864 --> 22:13.537
Of course he's the one.

22:13.599 --> 22:15.636
Last man he killed, he
rushed me to go to Paris

22:15.701 --> 22:17.009
to pick up the insurance checks.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.412
The $1,000,000 for Leo Gergis?

22:18.470 --> 22:21.349
That's right. Jack wanted an
accountant's check straight away.

22:21.407 --> 22:22.886
He wouldn't tell me why.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.354
I should've known then
he was going to betray me.

22:29.215 --> 22:31.252
The other names of the homeless.

22:37.289 --> 22:39.565
She didn't kill him. She
doesn't even know he was dead.

22:39.625 --> 22:41.536
Not to mention, the missing $14,000,000.

22:41.594 --> 22:44.074
It's not anywhere Bernard had access to.

22:44.129 --> 22:45.267
What about mademoiselle?

22:45.331 --> 22:47.208
Same story. We had her safe
deposit box opened.

22:47.266 --> 22:48.939
It was just insurance policies.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.378
So there's a third musketeer,

22:50.436 --> 22:52.416
who killed Bernard and took the money.

22:52.471 --> 22:54.849
What sunny part of the world do
you wanna start looking for him?

22:54.907 --> 22:56.511
Look who's here.

22:57.042 --> 23:00.512
The insurance companies sent him
to help us recoup their money.

23:03.415 --> 23:05.224
- Hello, Mr. Stevens.
- You arrested someone.

23:05.284 --> 23:07.025
- GOREN: That's right.
- Did you find the money?

23:07.086 --> 23:09.692
- EAMES: Not yet.
- Haven't they told you where it is?

23:09.755 --> 23:10.790
Apparently, they don't know.

23:10.856 --> 23:11.891
Well, how is that possible?

23:13.158 --> 23:14.193
We'll find out.

23:14.293 --> 23:15.533
How are you going to find out?

23:17.263 --> 23:19.539
My partner would love to explain it to you.

23:19.598 --> 23:20.599
I've got work to do.

23:20.666 --> 23:23.840
Mr. Stevens, why don't we just go in here.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.711
Right in there.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.320
I offended her.

23:32.378 --> 23:34.380
Well, she was uncomfortable.

23:34.446 --> 23:37.222
She thought that you were staring at her.

23:37.783 --> 23:40.093
I gave her too much eye contact.

23:40.219 --> 23:43.166
I try to watch myself,
but sometimes I forget.

23:44.056 --> 23:46.332
Well, you were preoccupied with the money.

23:46.392 --> 23:49.464
My employers are very
concerned about the money.

23:50.029 --> 23:52.236
Well, there's no trace of it.

23:52.731 --> 23:55.337
The man who engineered the plan

23:55.401 --> 23:57.972
and did the killings is dead.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.913
We arrested his girlfriend.

24:00.973 --> 24:02.884
Well, she probably has the money.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.580
Women like money.

24:05.611 --> 24:06.988
So do men.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.356
That's because women like men with money.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.571
This is everything we have on the case.

24:22.628 --> 24:26.599
They were planning on killing
2 more people, 16 total.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.574
I haven't figured out the pattern yet.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.913
Just because things are in
physical or temporal proximity

24:36.976 --> 24:38.478
doesn't mean they're connected.

24:39.645 --> 24:42.819
What, now you're saying
that there are coincidences?

24:42.881 --> 24:46.351
No. A coincidence is two unrelated events

24:46.418 --> 24:49.024
that appear alike,
happening at the same time.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.967
Two brothers dying in two car
accidents on the same day.

24:52.024 --> 24:55.403
Yes, but if you look
at those two events carefully,

24:55.627 --> 24:58.437
there are more differences between
them than there are similarities.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.340
They're not really alike.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.847
Excuse me.

25:07.773 --> 25:10.413
If I look at someone when I talk to them

25:10.476 --> 25:13.980
for more than two thirds of
the time, I seem aggressive.

25:17.149 --> 25:20.130
But if I look at them for less
than one third of the time,

25:20.185 --> 25:21.823
I seem dishonest.

25:23.322 --> 25:25.359
I'm still practicing this.

25:37.069 --> 25:39.777
You 2 looked like you
were having so much fun.

25:39.838 --> 25:41.749
Oh, he's an interesting man.

25:41.807 --> 25:43.480
These are the insurance policies

25:43.542 --> 25:45.522
from the French girl's safe deposit box.

25:45.577 --> 25:48.057
Leo Gergis' policy had a letter attached.

25:48.113 --> 25:50.491
It's from the insurance company.

25:53.485 --> 25:56.728
"The medical exam revealed the
presence of a heart murmur.

25:56.822 --> 25:59.735
"Mr. Gergis contacted us by phone

25:59.792 --> 26:03.501
"and informed us he had
a congenital heart condition.

26:03.829 --> 26:05.706
"As a result, we attached
a rider to the policy

26:05.764 --> 26:08.005
"to cover this preexisting condition."

26:08.067 --> 26:10.069
Gergis called them by phone, out of the blue?

26:10.135 --> 26:11.580
This homeless guy?

26:11.637 --> 26:13.514
Doesn't make sense.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.012
Or someone else pretending to be Gergis.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.716
Jack Bernard or the guy who killed him?

26:19.878 --> 26:23.553
Well, I mean, Jack wouldn't
know his full medical history.

26:26.452 --> 26:28.363
But you know who would?

26:32.925 --> 26:35.371
EAMES: Did you know your
brother had a heart condition?

26:35.427 --> 26:38.431
Yes. He was born with it.
What does that have to do with anything?

26:38.497 --> 26:40.909
Did you ever talk to an
insurance company about it?

26:40.966 --> 26:43.173
About his heart condition?
No.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.144
Why? What happened?

26:45.204 --> 26:48.151
Someone took out insurance
on your ex-husband,

26:48.407 --> 26:51.081
a million dollars' worth,
and then they killed him.

26:51.143 --> 26:55.148
You see, it was an opportunity
that they couldn't resist.

26:58.083 --> 27:00.996
But his death wasn't a total
waste, was it, Mr. Gergis?

27:01.053 --> 27:04.728
Of course it was. His death, his life,

27:04.790 --> 27:06.599
it was just a waste.

27:06.658 --> 27:08.433
His kids wouldn't agree.

27:08.494 --> 27:11.338
Thanks to the insurance, they
both have a college fund.

27:13.765 --> 27:15.904
Oh, your brother-in-law didn't tell you?

27:15.968 --> 27:19.711
He set up a trust fund for a
million dollars in their names.

27:24.376 --> 27:28.552
It didn't take a lot of detective
work to figure that out.

27:29.248 --> 27:30.886
Ben, what are they saying?

27:30.949 --> 27:33.122
You took insurance out on Leo?

27:33.185 --> 27:36.132
GOREN: No. No, but he found out who did.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.665
And after Leo was killed,

27:40.926 --> 27:43.930
he blackmailed them
into giving him the money.

27:45.764 --> 27:47.835
EAMES: How did you figure it out, Mr. Gergis?

27:47.900 --> 27:50.608
You got a hold of the guys
who did the medical exam?

27:50.669 --> 27:53.377
Is that how you found Jack Bernard?

27:53.438 --> 27:55.941
I never thought they would kill him.

27:56.475 --> 27:59.615
I thought they had some
other kind of scam going.

27:59.678 --> 28:03.421
But once Leo was dead, you thought
you'd do something for your family.

28:03.482 --> 28:05.860
He never took responsibility.

28:07.486 --> 28:09.898
EAMES: When did Jack give you the money?

28:09.955 --> 28:12.492
BEN: Friday, a week ago.

28:18.730 --> 28:20.368
Was he alone?

28:21.200 --> 28:22.440
Yes.

28:24.102 --> 28:28.016
He seemed pretty jumpy. He kept asking me

28:29.308 --> 28:31.049
who I had talked to about Leo.

28:31.109 --> 28:32.349
EAMES: Meaning the police?

28:32.411 --> 28:35.949
No. He wanted to know about other people.

28:38.083 --> 28:39.721
Other people?

28:40.085 --> 28:42.326
Other people connected to the scheme?

28:42.387 --> 28:44.458
What, he didn't want them
to find out about Leo?

28:44.523 --> 28:46.662
That's the impression I got.

28:46.725 --> 28:50.002
That he was trying to pull
a fast one on them.

28:58.637 --> 29:01.140
The girl already knew about Leo.

29:02.874 --> 29:06.447
Jack had another partner.
That's who he was worried about.

29:07.212 --> 29:10.125
Leo wasn't part of the original plan.

29:11.950 --> 29:15.488
The plan wasn't to kill
16 people. It was to kill 15.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.861
Leo was Jack's pet project.

29:19.925 --> 29:21.529
Jack got greedy.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.702
And Jack got himself killed.

29:29.568 --> 29:30.842
Progress?

29:31.203 --> 29:33.547
Looking for the third musketeer.

29:43.515 --> 29:47.156
Leo Gergis, he skews the whole design.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.893
Look, he was the only one
that was killed within a month

29:49.955 --> 29:51.332
of the policies being issued.

29:51.390 --> 29:54.735
And he was the only one that was
found dead in an industrial zone.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.330
You take him out and...

30:00.499 --> 30:02.638
Well, patterns become clear.

30:03.068 --> 30:05.742
The days that the bodies were
found, Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.876
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday.
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday. And the blocks

30:08.940 --> 30:12.820
that the bodies were left on.

30:13.912 --> 30:18.327
The 500 block, the 400 block, the
600, the 300, the 700 block.

30:18.383 --> 30:22.559
Minus one, plus two,
minus three, plus four.

30:22.688 --> 30:25.168
Dozens of small patterns.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.862
I'm finding dozens of small patterns.

30:28.927 --> 30:30.873
Jack Bernard thought of this?

30:30.929 --> 30:32.203
GOREN: No.

30:32.264 --> 30:35.541
The one time that he tried
to set up a kill on his own,

30:35.600 --> 30:39.013
he botched it and Jack doesn't
have the skill set to do this.

30:39.071 --> 30:40.675
Maybe his computer did.

31:02.027 --> 31:05.565
I'd hate to see what the assistant
chief adjuster's office looks like.

31:05.630 --> 31:07.803
This is how Wally likes it.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.346
- It's out of the way, huh?
- That's right.

31:10.402 --> 31:12.177
Wally's not much of a people person,

31:12.237 --> 31:14.581
but set him loose on a claim...

31:15.474 --> 31:16.953
He has kids.

31:17.008 --> 31:18.919
Hope springs eternal.

31:18.977 --> 31:21.389
You notice the windows?

31:21.446 --> 31:23.824
Mmm-hmm, different windows.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.355
Different houses.

31:27.686 --> 31:30.292
And that shadow there,

31:30.355 --> 31:32.562
that one was taken from a car.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.664
Did Wally move recently?

31:36.728 --> 31:38.264
I don't think so.

31:38.330 --> 31:40.332
He's still with his wife and kids?

31:40.399 --> 31:44.108
HANK: If he wasn't, I think he
would've mentioned something.

32:14.132 --> 32:17.136
EAMES: Our hunch was right. Wally's divorced,

32:17.202 --> 32:20.581
as of 2 years ago. His wife
remarried 6 months later.

32:21.573 --> 32:24.884
Remarried well, judging by
the house in the photo.

32:25.377 --> 32:28.984
She's a paralegal. She married
one of the partners at her firm.

32:29.047 --> 32:31.391
She got a restraining order against Wally.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.021
He was showing up at her house
every week with flowers,

32:34.085 --> 32:35.996
asking when she was coming home.

32:36.054 --> 32:37.897
Mr. Stevens was humiliated.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.095
No wonder he didn't tell his coworkers.

32:40.425 --> 32:42.405
It wouldn't have occurred to him to tell them.

32:42.461 --> 32:46.375
Has it occurred to you, you're looking
for something that's not there?

32:53.238 --> 32:57.812
"Symptoms include the need to
create and duplicate patterns.

32:59.110 --> 33:02.114
"impairment of nonverbal behavior,
such as eye-to-eye gaze.

33:02.180 --> 33:03.989
"inflexible adherence to routines,

33:04.049 --> 33:06.029
"often coupled with high intelligence

33:06.084 --> 33:09.725
"and a tendency to become preoccupied
with a particular subject."

33:09.788 --> 33:11.734
What are you describing?

33:11.790 --> 33:13.565
Asperger's syndrome.

33:13.925 --> 33:18.305
It's a high functioning form of autism.

33:18.363 --> 33:21.276
It's why Wally Stevens can't empathize.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.404
It's why he can't connect.

33:23.468 --> 33:26.972
It's why this pattern is in there.

33:34.479 --> 33:36.686
Time

33:38.950 --> 33:42.329
and space.

33:51.229 --> 33:53.300
These are the first five people

33:53.365 --> 33:55.777
who were insured in sequence.

34:12.516 --> 34:14.621
There, this is the pattern.

34:14.953 --> 34:17.399
And the same pattern for the next five.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.268
And the next five.

34:27.699 --> 34:30.009
EAMES: That leaves one pattern unfinished.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.911
It's very visual.

34:31.969 --> 34:35.440
Juries like visuals. I wish we could
show them the missing millions

34:35.507 --> 34:38.647
in Mr. Stevens' possession
or anything, for that matter,

34:38.710 --> 34:41.281
beyond these abstractions.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.625
Does Weehawken sound abstract to you?

34:54.125 --> 34:57.663
(PIANO PLAYING)

35:05.203 --> 35:07.205
(DOORBELL RINGING)

35:15.180 --> 35:18.354
Hey. Sorry to barge in on you so late.

35:18.416 --> 35:21.420
Something came up. We
wanted to run it by you.

35:22.153 --> 35:23.894
Have you had dinner yet?

35:23.955 --> 35:25.400
I was going to heat something up.

35:25.457 --> 35:26.993
Hope you like Chinese food.

35:27.058 --> 35:28.867
Yes. Yes, I do.

35:29.494 --> 35:31.405
We'll need plates.

35:31.463 --> 35:35.434
We would've come by earlier, but
my partner had to look at houses.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.673
Yeah, I'm gonna buy.

35:38.536 --> 35:39.708
I like this place.

35:39.771 --> 35:41.444
Looks like you got a lot of rooms.

35:41.506 --> 35:43.645
Aren't you gonna ask me where I'm looking?

35:43.708 --> 35:45.745
- Where are you looking?
- Whitestone.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.949
It's where my parents grew up.

35:48.013 --> 35:49.856
My partner's very sentimental.

35:49.914 --> 35:52.155
Well, it's what I can afford.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.895
What made you pick this house?

35:54.953 --> 35:57.934
I don't know. My wife picked it.

35:58.356 --> 36:02.236
GOREN: I noticed that there's a
grocery store around the corner.

36:02.293 --> 36:03.966
Yes, it's very convenient.

36:04.029 --> 36:06.566
That's what I need, you know, a deli.

36:07.198 --> 36:09.405
Something like that. Yeah,
just in walking distance.

36:09.467 --> 36:11.913
I like the one you looked at today.

36:12.203 --> 36:14.149
Off Francis Louis Boulevard.

36:14.205 --> 36:16.116
It's near Beachhurst.

36:17.475 --> 36:19.785
I'm not sure if I saw any
delis around there though.

36:19.844 --> 36:22.415
There's a deli on 154th Street.

36:23.214 --> 36:26.491
Hey, can I write that down?

36:30.055 --> 36:33.935
Could you show me where? Sorry.

36:35.126 --> 36:37.072
One egg roll or two?

36:37.128 --> 36:38.198
One.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.637
Please. Thank you.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.789
Bach-ing it tonight, huh?

36:52.844 --> 36:54.084
Wife out with the kids?

36:54.145 --> 36:55.920
Yes, they're out.

36:56.614 --> 37:01.063
You know what, you should...
You should ask him.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.530
I bet he knows.

37:04.589 --> 37:07.866
My brother moved into a
new house two months ago,

37:07.926 --> 37:11.840
and I'm sure I'm gonna
get lost getting there.

37:11.896 --> 37:14.376
It's off 495, Exit 2.

37:14.432 --> 37:15.502
Weehawken.

37:15.767 --> 37:17.804
Yes, Palisade Avenue.

37:18.336 --> 37:21.613
He says I take a right turn
and go under a bridge and...

37:21.673 --> 37:24.950
The bridge is to the left. Palisade
Avenue is three miles to the left.

37:25.009 --> 37:27.853
Oh, I better mark this down before I forget.

37:29.147 --> 37:31.627
I have no sense of direction.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.492
Do you mind?

37:41.926 --> 37:43.997
Well, I wonder where that
wife of yours is, huh?

37:44.062 --> 37:45.370
It's getting late.

37:45.430 --> 37:46.773
She's out.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.070
She's not out. She's gone.

37:49.334 --> 37:50.369
She'll be back.

37:50.435 --> 37:54.008
Sure, soon as she divorces
that rich lawyer she married.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.010
But that's not gonna happen,

37:59.878 --> 38:01.858
'cause women like money.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.261
Isn't that what you said?
"Women like men with money."

38:05.316 --> 38:06.886
And you don't have any money.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.555
No. No, I don't.

38:09.254 --> 38:11.632
Not even, let's say, $15,000,000?

38:11.689 --> 38:13.032
I don't have $15,000,000.

38:13.091 --> 38:14.331
How about $13,000,000?

38:14.392 --> 38:16.497
I don't have $15,000,000.
I don't have that money.

38:16.561 --> 38:18.006
Yes, you do.

38:19.864 --> 38:22.936
Because it's the only way you
know how to get your wife back.

38:24.736 --> 38:28.707
Because you could never offer
her what she really wanted,

38:28.773 --> 38:30.480
offer her a real relationship.

38:30.542 --> 38:33.716
No. I'm a good husband.
I'm loyal. I pay the bills.

38:33.778 --> 38:35.086
Obviously it wasn't enough,

38:35.146 --> 38:37.126
so you hooked up with Jack Bernard.

38:37.182 --> 38:39.389
I'm a good husband. I did not kill anybody.

38:39.450 --> 38:43.023
He had the inside track on the
homeless, the French girlfriend.

38:43.087 --> 38:45.567
And all you had was

38:46.858 --> 38:49.532
sheer analytical genius.

38:49.594 --> 38:51.631
I didn't kill anybody. Not me.

38:51.696 --> 38:52.936
GOREN: Yes, you did, Wally.

38:52.997 --> 38:55.671
You left your mark all over the scheme.

38:56.568 --> 39:01.017
The piece of music that
you play, over and over.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.982
Five bars, each with five notes.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.251
You like the number five.

39:11.749 --> 39:15.390
Five toes, five fingers, five photos.

39:16.421 --> 39:19.664
And the pattern that you make with them.

39:19.991 --> 39:22.335
And these dishes...

39:26.664 --> 39:28.803
But you're not aware of it.

39:30.802 --> 39:32.748
But can you see it now?

39:34.038 --> 39:38.953
No matter how hard you strive for chaos, it

39:41.212 --> 39:45.092
always comes out like this.

40:01.766 --> 40:03.302
I didn't kill anybody.

40:03.368 --> 40:05.245
You can't connect me to this.

40:05.303 --> 40:07.943
I'm not a killer. You can't connect me.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.563
You connected yourself.

40:21.719 --> 40:23.630
You're very thorough.

40:24.188 --> 40:26.395
You scouted each place

40:27.859 --> 40:30.339
where you would dump the bodies.

40:31.129 --> 40:33.040
That's why you know Whitestone so well.

40:33.097 --> 40:36.306
And Weehawken. They're where you
planned to dump the other two victims

40:36.367 --> 40:38.574
you never got around to killing.

40:39.470 --> 40:42.451
Don't you remember? You told
us when you met us.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.481
"They always betray themselves."

41:00.625 --> 41:02.400
Why would I do that?

41:02.827 --> 41:05.808
Why would I keep making this
pattern? I wouldn't do that.

41:05.863 --> 41:08.173
Because you can't help yourself.

41:10.268 --> 41:12.248
Because you don't know.

41:14.138 --> 41:15.913
I wouldn't do that.

41:17.709 --> 41:19.245
Look, I...

41:22.981 --> 41:26.155
I photocopied this for you.

41:27.352 --> 41:32.324
They only started diagnosing
Asperger's in 1994.

41:32.390 --> 41:34.768
You would have been too old by then.

41:37.662 --> 41:39.664
It's why you make patterns.

41:39.731 --> 41:42.610
It's why you're not very good with people

41:43.301 --> 41:45.281
and your wife left you.

41:48.740 --> 41:51.653
Oh. Oh.

41:56.914 --> 41:58.655
It's me. That's me.

41:59.717 --> 42:02.288
(GASPING)

42:04.288 --> 42:05.767
Why didn't somebody tell me?

42:05.823 --> 42:09.168
Why... Why didn't they...
Why didn't they tell me?

42:14.232 --> 42:17.839
Nothing is the same since they left.

42:17.902 --> 42:19.506
Nothing is the same since they left.

42:19.570 --> 42:21.413
I want everything to be the same.

42:21.472 --> 42:23.782
I want everything to be the same.

42:23.841 --> 42:26.117
(PANTING)

42:29.914 --> 42:33.828
The house is so empty.
This house is so empty.

42:37.121 --> 42:41.934
Nothing's the same. Nothing's the same.

42:50.001 --> 42:51.708
EAMES: As soon as his lawyer gets here,

42:51.769 --> 42:53.305
he wants to make a full statement.

42:53.371 --> 42:55.476
CARVER: To think his murders
almost went undetected.

42:55.540 --> 42:56.541
GOREN: Well, his murders did.

42:56.607 --> 42:58.348
It was Jack Bernard's that didn't.

42:58.409 --> 43:00.116
DEAKINS: Criminal mastermind.

43:00.178 --> 43:02.283
They don't make them like they used to.

43:08.319 --> 43:10.526
I'm sure he'd like a pen pal.
