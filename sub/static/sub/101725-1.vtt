WEBVTT

01:01.413 --> 01:04.316
Why can't I wake up?

02:56.994 --> 02:58.330
Mom?

03:03.535 --> 03:05.936
Mama?

03:11.141 --> 03:12.243
Mom!

03:36.301 --> 03:38.169
Well, hey, there, sleepyhead.

03:42.940 --> 03:45.276
You dream something good?

03:45.310 --> 03:48.580
Didn't feel like a dream.

03:48.613 --> 03:52.082
What do you mean?

03:52.116 --> 03:54.319
I woke up from something,
but...

03:58.323 --> 04:01.292
You know, I've always wondered

04:01.326 --> 04:06.096
if our dreams go on
after we wake up.

04:06.130 --> 04:10.602
Like parallel lives we live
when we sleep.

04:30.688 --> 04:32.357
You okay, Charlotte?

04:42.567 --> 04:43.735
Oh, no. Oh, no!

04:43.768 --> 04:46.171
Aaah!

04:48.773 --> 04:51.008
Fuckin' moron.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.143
After all these years.

04:54.779 --> 04:57.248
Got old real quick.

04:57.282 --> 04:59.684
I said don't get my hair wet!

04:59.717 --> 05:03.188
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry to get
your hair wet in the lake.

05:03.221 --> 05:07.225
I just can't believe
it's all over.

05:07.258 --> 05:08.493
Yeah, I know.

05:11.763 --> 05:15.233
I guess it's the big things
you never see coming, huh?

05:15.266 --> 05:16.434
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:25.243 --> 05:27.345
I saw the truck, too.

05:31.716 --> 05:35.186
Yeah.

05:35.220 --> 05:38.088
It looked just like Joe's.

05:38.121 --> 05:41.359
Yeah, but it can't be,
though, right?

05:41.392 --> 05:43.661
I mean, you think
he even still lives here?

05:48.700 --> 05:50.401
Have you heard
anything about him?

05:50.435 --> 05:52.470
You'd know if I did.

05:55.306 --> 05:57.308
I don't know.
Sometimes I wonder.

06:01.746 --> 06:06.049
I know how much
you still worry about him.

06:06.083 --> 06:08.186
Which is why I still
worry about <i>you.</i>

06:13.858 --> 06:15.827
Olivia!

06:15.860 --> 06:18.061
What?

06:18.095 --> 06:20.465
What are you doing?

06:20.498 --> 06:22.767
Leave me alone!

06:31.843 --> 06:34.479
Last first day of summer.

06:34.512 --> 06:37.080
It's been a while since
I've been swimming in the dark.

06:37.114 --> 06:40.351
Who knows what nasty things
are in there?

06:51.429 --> 06:54.165
There's rocks!

06:54.198 --> 06:56.834
- My butt...
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

06:56.868 --> 06:58.736
Will!

06:58.770 --> 07:01.138
- You fucking dick!
- Charlotte, run your shit.

07:01.172 --> 07:04.576
I'm not wearing a bathing suit.

07:04.609 --> 07:05.777
Will, stop.

07:08.313 --> 07:10.281
Are you gonna go swimming
or not?

07:10.315 --> 07:12.717
- Will, stop.
- You're an asshole.

07:12.750 --> 07:14.419
Charlotte!

07:14.452 --> 07:15.453
Oh, Will...

08:10.208 --> 08:12.543
- Shh.
- Shh, shh, shh.

08:17.882 --> 08:19.917
Fucking asshole, Will.
You could've hurt me.

08:22.854 --> 08:25.256
See?

08:25.289 --> 08:27.825
What was that?

08:27.859 --> 08:31.529
What is that, a fucking fox?

08:34.532 --> 08:36.401
That must be one hell of a fox.

08:36.434 --> 08:39.504
You see that? You see that?

08:39.537 --> 08:40.905
That's how you
treat a young lady.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.774
I'm telling you, brother,
they're beautiful.

08:49.414 --> 08:51.449
- What's going on?
- What's up, Tay?

08:51.482 --> 08:52.984
Where you coming from, man?

08:59.824 --> 09:01.893
Is that Brady?

09:01.926 --> 09:04.462
- Joe's Brady?
- Yes.

09:08.900 --> 09:10.935
What was her name again?

09:14.939 --> 09:16.774
Daphne Bell.

09:26.551 --> 09:29.954
Been a long time, kid.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.956
Hasn't been that long.

09:31.989 --> 09:35.560
It has for <i>me.</i>

09:35.593 --> 09:37.628
I'm glad you're still
coming to Robby's.

09:37.662 --> 09:39.597
Fuckin' kidding me?
I basically live here.

09:39.630 --> 09:41.666
Yeah, I know.
I'm fucking with you.

09:43.935 --> 09:46.471
I figured it was
gonna be a shit show.

09:48.406 --> 09:51.309
Heard you're up
to some big shit, though.

09:51.342 --> 09:53.945
Who'd have figured you
for a city girl?

09:56.881 --> 09:59.784
What about the rest of them?

09:59.817 --> 10:02.019
What they got going on?

10:02.053 --> 10:04.856
I don't know. UGA, Auburn.

10:04.889 --> 10:09.060
Will's going to SCAD. Clemson.

10:09.093 --> 10:11.729
Daphne, she's, uh, starting
classes in the summer.

10:11.763 --> 10:13.464
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

10:13.498 --> 10:14.632
That's great.

10:27.078 --> 10:28.813
Oh, fuckin', uh...

10:28.846 --> 10:32.083
clipped a deer on the way here
on 20.

10:32.116 --> 10:33.985
Exploded all over
my windshield and shit.

10:34.018 --> 10:35.453
Are y'all okay?

10:35.486 --> 10:36.888
Yeah, we're...
we're... we're good.

10:36.921 --> 10:38.556
Was a mess, though, man.

10:38.589 --> 10:39.824
Daphne nearly had
a heart attack.

10:39.857 --> 10:42.593
She was pregnant.

10:42.627 --> 10:45.296
Yeah. It was fucked up.

10:52.470 --> 10:54.505
I'm glad y'all are okay.

10:54.539 --> 10:56.307
You see Joe anymore?

11:00.111 --> 11:01.412
No.

11:04.682 --> 11:06.684
No, not for a while.

11:06.717 --> 11:08.686
I was actually gonna
ask y'all about him.

11:08.719 --> 11:12.657
Oh, no. Don't ask me. I'm...
I'm the last one you ask.

11:12.690 --> 11:15.526
Guy's a fucking ghost.

11:28.072 --> 11:30.107
Nice one.
I'll see y'all later.

11:30.141 --> 11:32.610
Okay. Bye, Will.

11:35.413 --> 11:37.615
You are on the way home.

11:37.648 --> 11:41.552
I can take you quicker
than them.

11:41.586 --> 11:43.754
Sure.

11:51.829 --> 11:53.798
Kind of feels like a dream,
don't it?

11:53.831 --> 11:55.167
What does?

11:55.200 --> 11:57.802
The last day of high school.

12:00.638 --> 12:02.907
Look, man.
I'm sorry about the fireworks.

12:02.940 --> 12:06.711
You know, I didn't know you
weren't wearing a bathing suit.

12:06.744 --> 12:09.046
I'm j... I'm just like...
I'm like a shitty dog, man.

12:15.453 --> 12:17.121
Well, ain't you quiet.

12:20.892 --> 12:23.928
Sounded like a woman earlier.

12:23.961 --> 12:27.865
Man, I feel like this is gonna
be the song of the summer.

13:17.282 --> 13:19.850
What are you doing home?

13:21.619 --> 13:24.722
Holy shit.

13:24.755 --> 13:27.692
- Look at you.
- Stop.

13:27.725 --> 13:29.794
My high school graduate.

13:33.831 --> 13:36.901
Aren't you dressed
a little early?

13:36.934 --> 13:40.004
Yeah, I'm going to meet
the girls at Olivia's first.

13:43.708 --> 13:46.777
Is that new?

13:46.811 --> 13:51.716
No. Mom actually got it
for me last spring.

13:51.749 --> 13:54.286
Just haven't found a reason
to wear it till now.

13:54.319 --> 13:56.954
Well, I'm sure she would've
loved to see you in it.

14:00.958 --> 14:03.527
Well...

15:05.990 --> 15:07.625
Mama...

15:11.263 --> 15:15.699
...I wanted to come back here
for so long...

15:21.772 --> 15:23.808
...but I was afraid to...

15:30.215 --> 15:34.152
...knowing that I wouldn't hear
your singing downstairs...

15:37.988 --> 15:41.759
...or feel your presence
in the other room...

15:54.038 --> 15:57.041
...but somehow I still do.

16:14.859 --> 16:17.362
So, I just want to know...

16:22.700 --> 16:25.102
...are you here with me?

16:46.123 --> 16:49.327
<i>Madison, I'm gonna
miss you so much,</i>

16:49.361 --> 16:51.296
<i>but I wish you all the success
and the happiness</i>

16:51.329 --> 16:53.931
<i>the world has to offer you
because, out of anyone,</i>

16:53.964 --> 16:58.102
<i>I know you absolutely
deserve it the most.</i>

16:58.135 --> 17:00.137
<i>And with that,
it's my great pleasure to...</i>

17:00.172 --> 17:01.906
<i>It's a brave new world
out there,</i>

17:01.939 --> 17:03.807
<i>and if anyone
can make the best of it</i>

17:03.841 --> 17:06.444
<i>and start all over again,
we can.</i>

17:06.478 --> 17:09.046
<i>Congrats! We made it!</i>

17:13.784 --> 17:14.952
Hey.

17:14.985 --> 17:16.921
Did you find your dad?

17:16.954 --> 17:18.923
No.

17:18.956 --> 17:21.159
Well, that's not right.

17:21.193 --> 17:22.893
Where do you think he'd be?

17:22.927 --> 17:24.929
I have no idea.

17:26.298 --> 17:28.799
Well...

17:28.832 --> 17:30.368
Well, what are you gonna do?

17:30.402 --> 17:33.003
I'm just gonna catch up
with y'all later.

17:33.037 --> 17:35.940
Charlotte!

17:35.973 --> 17:37.141
Let's fucking rave!

17:49.154 --> 17:51.189
Dad?

18:16.281 --> 18:17.449
<i>You've reached
Chief Rex Williams,</i>

18:17.482 --> 18:19.116
<i>Ajero Police Department.</i>

18:19.149 --> 18:20.318
<i>Leave your name and number,
and I'll...</i>

18:51.516 --> 18:53.485
Hello?

18:58.022 --> 18:59.890
<i>Hey.</i>

19:04.429 --> 19:06.964
Joe?

19:21.313 --> 19:23.181
You want to go for a ride?

19:28.553 --> 19:31.121
You're back from the dead.

19:34.559 --> 19:37.629
I wouldn't say that.

19:37.662 --> 19:39.631
I like your dress.

19:44.402 --> 19:46.103
I was gonna wear it to prom.

19:46.136 --> 19:48.573
Oh, yeah?

19:48.606 --> 19:52.210
Why didn't you?

19:52.243 --> 19:53.911
I didn't go.

19:59.584 --> 20:02.420
What's different about you?

20:02.454 --> 20:04.289
You know, I thought
about cutting it all off,

20:04.322 --> 20:06.023
but then I remembered...

20:06.056 --> 20:08.092
I feel like I don't
even recognize you.

20:10.595 --> 20:12.464
It's still me.

20:15.233 --> 20:16.568
It's hard to believe.

20:19.537 --> 20:20.938
You hurt yourself?

20:24.041 --> 20:27.178
- No, it's just a scrape.
- How'd you manage that?

20:27.212 --> 20:29.581
Swimming.
Slipped on the dock.

20:29.614 --> 20:31.449
You was out in Monroeville?

20:31.483 --> 20:33.318
So what?

20:33.351 --> 20:35.453
You didn't hear
what happened over there?

20:38.556 --> 20:40.291
Really?

20:43.695 --> 20:45.196
Okay.

20:47.699 --> 20:51.302
Well, nah, I mean,
if you was there...

20:51.336 --> 20:53.505
I must be crazy.

20:53.538 --> 20:55.105
Don't say that.

21:14.692 --> 21:18.163
Why did you call me tonight,
Joe?

21:22.400 --> 21:24.469
You remember last summer

21:24.502 --> 21:28.540
when we heard those booms
in the middle of the night?

21:28.573 --> 21:31.309
Remember no one knew
what we were talking about

21:31.342 --> 21:33.711
'cause we must have been
the only ones awake for miles?

21:33.745 --> 21:37.549
That was the most painful week
of my life, Joe.

21:37.582 --> 21:39.617
Do you ever hear 'em anymore?

21:39.651 --> 21:42.320
I don't really want to talk
about that time.

21:45.623 --> 21:48.326
I do.

21:48.359 --> 21:50.060
I heard them last night.

21:50.093 --> 21:52.764
That, uh...

21:52.797 --> 21:55.467
that giant.

21:58.101 --> 22:00.505
Nothing's changed, has it?

22:00.538 --> 22:04.242
Then why the fuck
did you answer?

22:04.275 --> 22:07.312
I could never say no to this.

22:11.783 --> 22:14.084
I wish you could.

22:23.795 --> 22:25.296
Where are we going?

22:37.375 --> 22:38.610
Why don't we find out?

23:36.401 --> 23:38.169
I'm sorry.

23:40.438 --> 23:44.709
I know I let you down, but...
I need you to know that...

23:44.742 --> 23:47.312
I'm really tired, and I think
I'm just gonna go to bed...

23:47.345 --> 23:49.247
A girl was killed tonight.

23:51.516 --> 23:54.252
A girl your age.

23:56.854 --> 23:59.157
In Monroeville?

24:00.825 --> 24:03.461
There's been another.

24:03.494 --> 24:07.198
Here.

24:07.231 --> 24:08.766
In town.

24:10.835 --> 24:13.504
A girl named Daphne Bell.

24:15.206 --> 24:17.475
Did you know her?

24:20.211 --> 24:21.746
Charlotte.

24:24.882 --> 24:27.452
I know some people who did.

24:46.871 --> 24:50.642
Nah, don't get quiet
on me now, Charlotte.

24:57.749 --> 25:01.352
You know, there's something
about the summer that just...

25:01.386 --> 25:03.488
takes me back...

25:07.792 --> 25:10.528
...that brings the past
back to life.

25:25.243 --> 25:27.478
It's all this sweat.

25:30.014 --> 25:31.983
All this... humidity.

25:34.819 --> 25:37.522
All the heat
of those endless nights

25:37.555 --> 25:41.325
when I felt myself
melt into you...

25:43.795 --> 25:45.496
...and you into me.

25:48.866 --> 25:51.936
But something tore us apart.

25:53.604 --> 25:57.275
And I remember you
lying awake next to me

25:57.308 --> 25:58.776
in the middle of the night...

26:02.046 --> 26:04.882
...and how you'd
get in your car and just

26:04.916 --> 26:07.719
drive all day...

26:07.752 --> 26:10.822
with no destination.

26:15.493 --> 26:17.862
But it's like your mama said...

26:17.895 --> 26:21.599
last summer...

26:21.632 --> 26:25.703
just before she died.

26:30.875 --> 26:33.544
Can't run from
where we've been...

26:38.750 --> 26:40.651
...and everything we've felt...

26:43.721 --> 26:46.457
...we'll feel again, Charlotte.

26:50.461 --> 26:52.563
All this heat.

26:55.433 --> 26:56.801
All this sweat.

26:58.903 --> 27:02.039
All this pain.

27:04.942 --> 27:08.045
Until we melt together again.

27:25.963 --> 27:30.735
Olivia, the boys
are calling for you!

27:30.768 --> 27:33.104
Hey, Ms. Calhoun, can I give you
a hand with anything?

27:33.137 --> 27:34.972
Uh, no.

27:35.006 --> 27:36.908
But I appreciate your asking,
darling.

27:36.941 --> 27:40.478
I don't even know
why I bother to do this.

27:40.511 --> 27:42.079
Nobody's going to be
eating this anyway.

27:42.113 --> 27:43.948
Who's that?

27:43.981 --> 27:48.452
That's that girl from
Monroeville. Ava Harris.

27:52.123 --> 27:53.424
Charlie, you ready?

27:53.457 --> 27:54.692
Are y'all gonna
have dinner here?

27:54.725 --> 27:56.961
- What's that behind your back?
- Nothing.

27:56.994 --> 28:00.765
- We're gonna eat at the festival.
- I saw that! Olivia!

28:00.798 --> 28:04.368
- About fucking time! Jesus!
- Hey!

28:04.402 --> 28:06.838
Y'all coming back
to eat or what?

28:27.959 --> 28:31.963
You know how in
"Nightmare Before Christmas"...

28:33.865 --> 28:38.603
...there's that
forest of holidays...

28:38.636 --> 28:40.605
where every single day
is the same holiday?

28:43.140 --> 28:45.676
Mine would totally be
Fourth of July.

28:49.981 --> 28:54.652
And I don't care that we're
clearly too old for this shit

28:54.685 --> 28:58.756
or that everyone else stopped
coming after freshman year.

28:58.789 --> 29:00.591
Where else could I rather be?

29:00.625 --> 29:03.628
That is not my fault.
I asked.

29:03.661 --> 29:05.129
It's here.
It's here, man.

29:05.163 --> 29:07.098
It's not here yet.

29:07.131 --> 29:11.102
You are really taking it
in spirit right now, aren't you?

29:12.904 --> 29:15.173
You think we heard her?

29:16.908 --> 29:18.075
Heard who?

29:18.109 --> 29:21.012
Ava Harris.

29:21.045 --> 29:23.881
- At the lake.
- What?

29:23.915 --> 29:25.783
Is that what your dad told you?

29:25.816 --> 29:27.885
My dad doesn't
tell me anything.

29:27.919 --> 29:31.156
I just can't stop thinking
about it...

29:31.189 --> 29:35.126
that we might have been there.

29:35.160 --> 29:37.561
I mean, we saw Daphne
on her last night on Earth,

29:37.595 --> 29:39.063
and it just...

29:39.096 --> 29:41.199
I feel like there's
something there.

29:41.233 --> 29:44.535
You don't know that that's got
anything to do with Daphne.

29:44.568 --> 29:47.004
But what if it does?

29:49.807 --> 29:51.943
What if something
was happening?

29:55.913 --> 29:58.816
Can you promise me
something, Charlotte?

29:58.849 --> 30:01.652
Because...

30:01.686 --> 30:03.587
I know this time of year
is tough on you.

30:03.621 --> 30:05.790
It's not that.

30:05.823 --> 30:10.094
And we've only got six weeks
left together now,

30:10.127 --> 30:12.964
- and they're gonna go by like...
- like that.

30:12.997 --> 30:14.232
So whatever's going on...

30:14.266 --> 30:15.900
Olivia.

30:15.933 --> 30:19.637
...and whatever's
going on with you...

30:19.670 --> 30:24.008
promise me that we will
stick together,

30:24.041 --> 30:25.810
no matter what.

30:29.146 --> 30:31.148
Promise me.

30:34.151 --> 30:35.720
I promise.

30:39.924 --> 30:42.660
Remember, that's a promise.

31:28.273 --> 31:32.344
Dude, I haven't had a fuckin'
Bud Light since seven...

31:32.377 --> 31:34.645
Since when?
I had one in the car.

31:34.678 --> 31:35.913
7:00.

31:35.946 --> 31:39.016
I haven't had
a fucking beer in hours.

32:24.762 --> 32:27.131
How you doing?

32:28.799 --> 32:30.368
You come here to see me?

32:30.402 --> 32:32.870
Just going down memory lane.

32:32.903 --> 32:36.040
Might've hoped you'd be
going that same way.

32:36.073 --> 32:39.311
Not exactly.
We tried that one.

32:39.344 --> 32:41.812
Yeah, I'm sorry
about what happened.

32:41.846 --> 32:44.216
It's, uh...

32:44.249 --> 32:47.118
I have good days,
and I have bad days.

32:47.151 --> 32:49.954
What do you want?

32:53.757 --> 32:56.428
I want to try again...

32:56.461 --> 32:58.028
tonight.

32:58.062 --> 33:00.432
That's all I want.

33:00.465 --> 33:03.834
You know, I'm leaving, too.

33:03.868 --> 33:05.069
Yeah, me and my folks,

33:05.102 --> 33:06.438
we're moving away
at the end of the...

33:06.471 --> 33:08.739
I already thought
you were gone, Joe.

33:20.218 --> 33:22.086
Don't you remember
how it used to be?

33:29.361 --> 33:32.930
Ah, she's wearing
a bathing suit at last, I see.

33:32.963 --> 33:35.065
Yeah, I learned my lesson.

33:35.099 --> 33:37.768
Where are your dumb fireworks
this time?

33:37.801 --> 33:40.971
Oh, I'm gonna bring us
fireworks, alright.

33:41.005 --> 33:42.973
What, are you trying
to be cute or something?

33:43.007 --> 33:44.074
Is it working?

33:46.178 --> 33:48.446
Better luck next time.

33:48.480 --> 33:50.848
Hey, it ain't sporting if
the whiskey does all the work.

33:50.881 --> 33:53.451
Oh, as if.

33:53.485 --> 33:56.288
You know, I overheard you
talking to Olivia earlier.

33:56.321 --> 33:58.956
This whole situation
is crazy, man.

34:00.525 --> 34:03.295
You know, I can feel
the town changing.

34:03.328 --> 34:05.129
Yeah, it's like you can
feel it in the air.

34:07.399 --> 34:10.100
I'm just saying.

34:10.134 --> 34:13.305
If you ever get scared and
you need someone to talk to...

34:13.338 --> 34:15.973
Oh, boy. Now you're
really trying to be cute.

34:16.006 --> 34:19.211
I mean, the killer...

34:19.244 --> 34:21.313
The killer could be out there,

34:21.346 --> 34:24.482
in the woods,
at this very moment...

34:24.516 --> 34:26.284
just watching us...

34:28.253 --> 34:33.191
...waiting for the right moment.

34:33.225 --> 34:34.359
Well, anyway, I'm getting in.

34:34.392 --> 34:36.194
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

34:36.228 --> 34:38.996
Are you just gonna leave me
all alone at a time like this?

34:39.029 --> 34:41.199
- You ain't even my type, anyway.
- Oh, yeah?

34:41.233 --> 34:43.067
What's your type?

34:43.100 --> 34:47.972
Well, you know, pretty,
blonde, moody types.

34:48.005 --> 34:49.341
- Is this what you wanted?
- Oh!

34:52.177 --> 34:53.345
- Come here, boy.
- What's up, brother?

34:53.378 --> 34:55.413
- Come here, boy.
- What's up?!

34:55.447 --> 34:57.415
Oh, okay! Okay!

35:19.537 --> 35:21.905
Wait.

35:28.380 --> 35:31.182
- I'm sorry.
- No.

35:31.216 --> 35:33.485
I am. I'm really sorry.
I don't know why...

35:33.518 --> 35:36.288
Don't.

35:36.321 --> 35:39.023
Brady, what are you doing here?

35:39.056 --> 35:42.160
How did you even know
we were here?

35:44.229 --> 35:47.165
I don't know
where to go anymore.

35:49.066 --> 35:51.269
Just got in my car, and...

35:53.971 --> 35:56.241
somehow I'm here.

36:00.044 --> 36:01.945
I didn't mean to crash y'all.

36:04.148 --> 36:06.884
I'm just alone
in the fucking dark.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.422
So I drive, and I drive

36:10.455 --> 36:12.257
because that's the last thing
she was doing.

36:12.290 --> 36:16.461
She was just driving,
but I want to know where.

36:16.494 --> 36:18.296
Where...

36:18.330 --> 36:20.097
Where was she going?

36:26.237 --> 36:30.007
I see her in you.

36:30.040 --> 36:32.876
And I want her back so bad.

36:32.910 --> 36:35.613
I know.

36:38.483 --> 36:40.618
I know, Brady. I'm sorry.

36:40.652 --> 36:43.020
You don't feel it, too?

36:48.125 --> 36:51.496
In the hairs on your neck...

36:51.529 --> 36:54.566
underneath your skin...

36:54.599 --> 36:57.268
that this is only the beginning.

36:57.302 --> 37:00.638
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:00.672 --> 37:02.873
Oh, you do.

37:03.641 --> 37:06.944
You think all this dancing

37:06.977 --> 37:08.480
and singing and laughing,

37:08.513 --> 37:11.316
you think... you think
you can hide in all this.

37:11.349 --> 37:14.319
But this is where he finds you.

37:14.352 --> 37:17.020
I wish I could help you, Brady.

37:17.054 --> 37:20.023
I wish I could help you, too.

37:22.993 --> 37:25.363
But you're just his type.

37:43.248 --> 37:46.518
Can we just drive?

37:46.551 --> 37:48.253
You got somewhere in mind?

38:12.343 --> 38:17.047
I don't want this
to be like last time.

38:17.080 --> 38:21.286
I just needed to get away.

38:21.319 --> 38:22.654
What from?

38:28.693 --> 38:30.228
I don't know.

38:34.732 --> 38:37.502
Sometimes, I still need you.

38:42.474 --> 38:45.677
I just hate feeling like
I have to run from you.

38:49.214 --> 38:51.316
Where would you even run to?

38:58.055 --> 39:00.391
To when I didn't feel this way.

39:08.131 --> 39:10.668
We can go back down
that road, Charlotte.

39:14.672 --> 39:17.275
But we both know where it goes.

39:34.859 --> 39:37.462
How did we even get here?

39:42.634 --> 39:45.203
Do you think we could get back?

39:47.305 --> 39:49.072
If we tried?

39:52.210 --> 39:53.545
Would you want to?

40:00.818 --> 40:03.221
More than anything.

40:06.324 --> 40:08.359
You know, every time
I smell fireworks,

40:08.393 --> 40:10.161
I think of you.

40:12.530 --> 40:15.199
I think of that 4th of July

40:15.233 --> 40:18.336
when you were in eighth grade,

40:18.369 --> 40:20.738
and we snuck into the fair.

40:22.407 --> 40:25.510
I remember that night.

40:30.214 --> 40:33.451
When I first kissed you
in this very place...

40:37.855 --> 40:40.258
...all those years ago.

40:51.336 --> 40:54.238
Why did you take me here, Joe?

41:21.733 --> 41:23.701
You ever get that feeling...

41:29.674 --> 41:34.479
...where you can't tell
if you remember something...

41:34.512 --> 41:36.681
or if it was a dream?

41:40.518 --> 41:42.787
More than you know.

41:50.695 --> 41:55.266
That's how I feel
about you now.

41:55.299 --> 41:57.669
Where have you been, Joe?

42:02.540 --> 42:06.310
I've been here...

42:06.344 --> 42:07.679
waiting for you.

42:46.584 --> 42:48.619
Thanks, Joe.

42:53.991 --> 42:55.860
Good night.

42:59.030 --> 43:00.798
Okay.

43:04.736 --> 43:09.674
Uh, I need you to know
that I drove past this house

43:09.707 --> 43:13.444
every night
for the better part of a year,

43:13.478 --> 43:16.481
and it was everything I could do

43:16.514 --> 43:19.550
not to knock on this door,

43:19.584 --> 43:24.355
to stand in front of you
and look in your eyes again.

43:24.388 --> 43:27.525
But after Daphne...

43:27.558 --> 43:28.893
You know, we can't
pass up the chance

43:28.926 --> 43:32.363
to say the things we need to.

43:32.396 --> 43:34.565
What would you
have said to her?

43:34.599 --> 43:37.935
Uh, not to <i>her.</i>

43:40.438 --> 43:41.672
To <i>you.</i>

43:43.908 --> 43:47.445
I'm sorry for everything
I did to you.

43:50.581 --> 43:54.352
I never wanted you to have
to go through all this alone.

43:59.056 --> 44:01.893
Why didn't you call me
that night, Joe?

44:09.867 --> 44:13.471
I just needed to stand
in your light again.

44:22.814 --> 44:25.416
Is this goodbye, then?

44:32.523 --> 44:34.792
It doesn't have to be.

44:40.965 --> 44:43.601
Okay.

44:58.783 --> 45:00.651
Oh, fuck it.

46:31.676 --> 46:33.644
<i>We're sorry.
You have reached a number</i>

46:33.678 --> 46:36.881
<i>that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.</i>

47:17.121 --> 47:18.656
Joe?

47:26.097 --> 47:28.099
Joe?

47:52.324 --> 47:54.792
Joe?

49:22.247 --> 49:24.148
So, is this where you've been?

49:27.084 --> 49:29.019
Did you follow me here?

49:29.053 --> 49:33.391
Charlotte, I haven't seen you
since the 4th.

49:33.425 --> 49:34.925
You don't answer my calls.

49:34.959 --> 49:36.961
Since the 4th. So what?

49:39.297 --> 49:42.167
It's been a week, Charlotte.

49:52.943 --> 49:57.215
I think something
terrible's happened.

50:26.944 --> 50:29.481
Is he inside?

50:47.831 --> 50:50.734
Charlotte.

50:50.768 --> 50:52.437
I asked you a question.

50:52.470 --> 50:55.906
I came to you
to help me find him.

50:55.940 --> 50:59.743
- Not to interrog...
- We are way past that.

50:59.777 --> 51:01.745
We crossed that line
last summer.

51:01.779 --> 51:04.516
Everybody says that.

51:04.549 --> 51:06.917
I was the one
who lived through it.

51:10.555 --> 51:13.325
He needs help.
He needs me.

51:13.358 --> 51:16.228
And what if you're wrong?

51:18.330 --> 51:20.097
The one time
I reach out to you,

51:20.130 --> 51:21.899
why did I think
you'd reach back?

51:21.932 --> 51:26.204
Do you know where
his parents are?

51:26.238 --> 51:27.472
Do you?

51:31.243 --> 51:33.978
They're not here.

51:34.011 --> 51:37.315
They haven't been for some time.

51:37.349 --> 51:40.050
- But I'm here.
- No, you're not.

51:40.084 --> 51:43.321
And this is me
reaching out to you.

51:48.393 --> 51:51.296
When I see the faces
of those three girls...

51:53.198 --> 51:55.866
- <i>Three</i> girls?
- ...I see you.

51:59.404 --> 52:03.007
And I'm begging you
to take my hand,

52:03.040 --> 52:06.010
because while you were out
that night with him...

52:08.280 --> 52:13.585
...Justine Corrigan was
bleeding to death in a ditch.

52:13.618 --> 52:17.555
Did the giant kill her, too?

52:17.589 --> 52:22.260
Charlotte, I'm seeing
something in you...

52:22.294 --> 52:25.530
that I prayed to God
I'd never see again...

52:28.500 --> 52:31.068
...and it scares me to death.

52:33.171 --> 52:35.206
Then why are you leaving me?

52:35.240 --> 52:37.609
Because I can't run from this.

52:37.642 --> 52:40.911
But you are.

52:40.944 --> 52:43.381
Don't you know what day it is?

52:46.651 --> 52:49.487
How could I forget?

52:56.528 --> 52:58.496
You were right, Charlotte.

53:03.335 --> 53:07.037
Something is happening.

53:07.071 --> 53:10.908
I heard about Justine Corrigan
on the news.

53:10.941 --> 53:15.280
I just got scared
thinking about you...

53:15.313 --> 53:19.417
and what could've happened
to you this week.

53:19.451 --> 53:22.487
We've been friends for so long,

53:22.520 --> 53:27.659
and I think I expect you
to be the person...

53:27.692 --> 53:30.027
I've always known.

53:31.529 --> 53:35.600
And I have this dream of us
when we were older,

53:35.633 --> 53:39.571
that we'd always be sisters.

53:39.604 --> 53:42.072
And I know it's not up to me.

53:45.943 --> 53:49.381
But I can't let you
go through this alone.

53:49.414 --> 53:51.316
But I am alone.

53:54.719 --> 53:56.954
Whether you're here or not.

54:24.382 --> 54:26.950
Let me in, mama.

55:34.719 --> 55:37.120
Charlotte...

55:39.390 --> 55:41.426
My precious...

55:44.229 --> 55:45.730
My baby...

55:50.435 --> 55:53.505
Why did you have to do it?

55:55.473 --> 55:57.040
I wish
that I could've been

55:57.074 --> 55:59.109
stronger for you.

56:01.779 --> 56:06.083
I wish that
I could've protected you.

56:08.520 --> 56:12.457
That I could've given you
a better world than here.

56:15.260 --> 56:18.496
I always knew
you wanted to do it.

56:22.166 --> 56:24.067
This pit in my stomach

56:24.101 --> 56:26.304
every time I came home

56:26.337 --> 56:31.309
to see you looking out
that back door.

56:31.342 --> 56:36.648
All I ever wanted was
this life to be a gift to you.

56:36.681 --> 56:40.083
All its beauty.

56:40.117 --> 56:43.221
All its hope.

56:43.254 --> 56:46.624
All its light.

56:46.658 --> 56:48.259
Why can't it be?

56:50.428 --> 56:52.129
Because...

57:07.812 --> 57:11.249
...now I know better.

57:11.282 --> 57:14.686
And my fear is

57:14.719 --> 57:16.754
that one day...

57:18.690 --> 57:20.725
...you will, too.

1:00:02.820 --> 1:00:03.888
Charlotte?

1:00:06.524 --> 1:00:09.827
Charlotte, honey.
It's time to wake up.

1:00:16.768 --> 1:00:20.872
Baby, have you even moved
since last night?

1:00:20.905 --> 1:00:23.341
What are you doing here?

1:00:24.876 --> 1:00:27.345
Let's get you out of here.

1:00:27.378 --> 1:00:29.480
Just for a bit.

1:00:34.819 --> 1:00:36.988
Did he do this to you?

1:00:48.132 --> 1:00:51.502
We going or what?

1:00:51.536 --> 1:00:52.703
Where?

1:00:52.737 --> 1:00:54.071
The movies.

1:00:54.105 --> 1:00:55.640
It's, um...

1:00:55.673 --> 1:00:58.042
We're gonna be late, so...

1:01:00.578 --> 1:01:05.383
Where were you
when I was lost?

1:01:05.416 --> 1:01:08.986
I'm with you now.

1:01:09.020 --> 1:01:12.857
Because we promised each other
that we always would be.

1:01:15.026 --> 1:01:17.461
So put everything else
behind you...

1:01:20.131 --> 1:01:23.668
...like your life depends
on it...

1:01:29.106 --> 1:01:30.908
...because it might.

1:01:35.913 --> 1:01:39.851
I see those girls on TV.

1:01:39.884 --> 1:01:44.889
All I can think about is
how lonely they must be now

1:01:44.922 --> 1:01:48.125
and all the things
they'll never know,

1:01:48.160 --> 1:01:51.462
all the memories
they'll never have,

1:01:51.495 --> 1:01:54.699
of what it'll have been like
to live through this summer

1:01:54.732 --> 1:01:58.069
when a killer walked
these streets...

1:02:00.571 --> 1:02:02.073
...when we had to
sneak out of houses

1:02:02.106 --> 1:02:06.677
in the middle of the night
because there was a curfew

1:02:06.711 --> 1:02:10.815
and the whole town
was so afraid.

1:02:10.848 --> 1:02:14.518
But we won't let ourselves be.

1:02:14.552 --> 1:02:17.421
Because maybe one weekend,

1:02:17.455 --> 1:02:19.457
my parents will be out of town,

1:02:19.490 --> 1:02:23.594
so we'll sing
till we lose our voices

1:02:23.628 --> 1:02:26.797
and we'll dance all night...

1:02:29.234 --> 1:02:33.070
...because we won't let it in...

1:02:33.104 --> 1:02:35.573
even if it's always knockin'...

1:02:38.576 --> 1:02:42.180
...and a voice inside you
tells you to open that door.

1:02:46.017 --> 1:02:48.920
Because it can be so dark
out there...

1:02:51.522 --> 1:02:54.825
...darker than we would know.

1:02:54.859 --> 1:02:59.231
Because it won't always
be this sweet.

1:02:59.264 --> 1:03:01.866
And one day...

1:03:01.899 --> 1:03:04.535
we won't know
each other anymore...

1:03:07.838 --> 1:03:10.574
...and it may come
sooner than you think.

1:03:15.079 --> 1:03:19.884
Because this summer is
gonna go by so, so fast.

1:03:22.887 --> 1:03:24.588
Charlotte.

1:03:26.857 --> 1:03:28.025
Charlotte?

1:03:30.828 --> 1:03:33.531
It will be over
before we know it.

1:03:38.736 --> 1:03:41.973
Did you sleep through
the whole thing?

1:03:47.878 --> 1:03:49.113
Where did we park?

1:03:49.146 --> 1:03:50.581
Over there.

1:03:52.550 --> 1:03:54.118
Do you need help setting up?

1:03:56.587 --> 1:03:58.789
Are you sure it's okay that...

1:03:58.823 --> 1:04:00.925
we do this?

1:04:00.958 --> 1:04:03.527
I mean, with your dad
and everything.

1:04:03.561 --> 1:04:05.696
Obviously, I didn't tell him.

1:04:05.730 --> 1:04:07.932
It's a party, dum-dum.

1:04:07.965 --> 1:04:11.736
No, I know,
but also the curfew.

1:04:11.769 --> 1:04:15.106
Like that's stopped us before.

1:04:15.139 --> 1:04:16.574
Okay.

1:04:19.844 --> 1:04:22.247
It's not...

1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:25.016
too hard for you
to go back there?

1:04:25.049 --> 1:04:27.685
No.

1:04:27.718 --> 1:04:30.255
I'm ready to make new memories.

1:04:30.288 --> 1:04:32.056
Whoa.

1:04:32.089 --> 1:04:33.624
Look at that.

1:04:33.657 --> 1:04:35.659
You just gave me chills.

1:04:35.693 --> 1:04:37.728
Besides, it's our last night.

1:07:15.453 --> 1:07:17.054
You going somewhere?

1:07:18.122 --> 1:07:20.791
No, I just...

1:07:20.824 --> 1:07:24.162
I didn't know you were gonna
be home tonight, so...

1:07:24.196 --> 1:07:27.165
You don't got to lie to me,
Charlotte.

1:07:36.408 --> 1:07:41.213
Well, I promise,
I won't stay out too late.

1:07:45.550 --> 1:07:47.151
Dad.

1:07:59.797 --> 1:08:02.300
Dad?

1:08:02.334 --> 1:08:05.769
I'm gonna resign tomorrow,
Charlotte.

1:08:05.803 --> 1:08:09.006
Wh-What are you talking about?

1:08:09.039 --> 1:08:11.243
Justine Corrigan's boyfriend

1:08:11.276 --> 1:08:14.346
turned himself in this morning.

1:08:14.379 --> 1:08:15.980
Older kid.

1:08:18.316 --> 1:08:20.951
Her friends didn't even
know who he was.

1:08:23.421 --> 1:08:26.157
Said he was high...

1:08:26.191 --> 1:08:29.494
that he couldn't remember
what the hell happened.

1:08:29.527 --> 1:08:31.429
He just sat there
in front of them,

1:08:31.463 --> 1:08:34.266
crying his eyes out.

1:08:36.468 --> 1:08:39.304
Some day, someone else
is gonna find out

1:08:39.337 --> 1:08:43.040
who killed Ava Harris
or Daphne Bell,

1:08:43.073 --> 1:08:47.445
but I can't imagine
what difference it's gonna make

1:08:47.479 --> 1:08:51.316
or what clarity
it's gonna bring.

1:08:53.117 --> 1:08:56.954
Justine was stabbed 47 times.

1:08:59.157 --> 1:09:01.426
I saw her...

1:09:07.165 --> 1:09:11.068
I know I haven't been strong
enough for you, Charlotte.

1:09:11.101 --> 1:09:15.839
I think in all my pain,
I lost sight of yours.

1:09:15.873 --> 1:09:19.277
But I want...
I want you to promise me

1:09:19.311 --> 1:09:23.080
that when you leave here
tomorrow, that...

1:09:26.984 --> 1:09:30.288
Dad, don't get that.

1:09:30.322 --> 1:09:31.623
Please.

1:09:33.924 --> 1:09:37.329
Please don't answer that.

1:09:37.362 --> 1:09:38.630
I'm sorry.

1:09:46.438 --> 1:09:50.908
Where in town?

1:09:50.941 --> 1:09:53.645
Okay.
Just get it locked down.

1:09:55.580 --> 1:09:57.948
Charlotte?

1:10:31.716 --> 1:10:33.150
Charlie!

1:10:33.184 --> 1:10:36.421
Oh, look at you!

1:10:36.454 --> 1:10:40.158
Where's your...
Where's your drink?

1:10:40.191 --> 1:10:42.227
I'm gonna get you a drink.

1:10:42.260 --> 1:10:43.528
Where's Olivia?

1:10:54.339 --> 1:10:56.374
Fuckin' A!-

1:10:56.408 --> 1:10:58.276
Look who decided to show up.

1:10:58.309 --> 1:11:00.345
- Where's Olivia?
- How the hell should I know?

1:11:00.378 --> 1:11:02.414
I'm not her fucking daddy.

1:11:02.447 --> 1:11:04.349
- Are you wasted?
- Should I not be?

1:11:04.382 --> 1:11:07.084
- This is the fucking end, man!
- This is the end!

1:11:07.117 --> 1:11:09.153
So will you soon be,
too, so come on...

1:11:09.187 --> 1:11:10.688
waste not, want not,
or whatever.

1:11:10.722 --> 1:11:12.956
- Will, stop.
- Come on. What?

1:11:12.990 --> 1:11:15.226
- Help me help you!
- Charlie!

1:11:15.260 --> 1:11:18.730
Hi! You made it.

1:11:18.763 --> 1:11:21.166
Dude, it's so fucking hot.

1:11:21.199 --> 1:11:24.436
I need to talk to you
about something.

1:11:24.469 --> 1:11:26.069
Okay.

1:11:30.073 --> 1:11:32.343
- Excuse us.
- Excuse you.

1:11:37.182 --> 1:11:40.418
We need to leave.

1:11:40.452 --> 1:11:43.421
- All of us.
- Why?

1:11:43.455 --> 1:11:45.490
'Cause your dad
is gonna bust us?

1:11:45.523 --> 1:11:47.258
- No.
- Who fucking cares?

1:11:47.292 --> 1:11:48.693
I changed my mind.

1:11:48.726 --> 1:11:52.163
I just have a really bad feeling
about being there.

1:11:52.197 --> 1:11:54.732
Shhhhhhh.

1:11:54.766 --> 1:11:58.035
It's my fucking birthday.

1:11:58.068 --> 1:12:00.538
I'm not going anywhere.

1:12:00.572 --> 1:12:02.740
We're not safe here.

1:12:02.774 --> 1:12:05.677
If not here, then where?

1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:11.416
You hear that?

1:12:11.449 --> 1:12:13.083
You're not listening to me.

1:12:13.116 --> 1:12:14.619
Please dance with me.

1:12:14.652 --> 1:12:16.119
Please?

1:12:16.153 --> 1:12:17.689
There's something
happening out there.

1:12:17.722 --> 1:12:20.625
This is gonna be the song
we remember the summer by.

1:12:20.658 --> 1:12:22.660
Why aren't you listening to me?

1:12:22.694 --> 1:12:25.263
Because...

1:12:25.296 --> 1:12:29.400
sometimes we need people
not to listen to us...

1:12:29.434 --> 1:12:33.371
make us dance when it hurts...

1:12:33.404 --> 1:12:35.507
Even when we're scared.

1:12:38.075 --> 1:12:41.746
Tomorrow, all of this
is gonna be gone,

1:12:41.779 --> 1:12:43.648
and you're gonna wonder

1:12:43.681 --> 1:12:45.650
how you let it just...

1:12:45.683 --> 1:12:48.520
get away from you.

1:12:48.553 --> 1:12:51.389
What's out there is out there.

1:12:53.858 --> 1:12:56.294
It's just you and me in here.

1:13:13.411 --> 1:13:17.147
I swear, that storm's
been coming all summer.

1:13:17.181 --> 1:13:20.251
It just all feels like a dream.

1:13:23.688 --> 1:13:27.124
Everyone's going away.

1:13:27.158 --> 1:13:30.261
Except we're never
gonna wake up.

1:13:41.773 --> 1:13:43.541
You're crying.

1:13:48.279 --> 1:13:50.882
Why'd it have to be this way?

1:13:54.252 --> 1:13:57.455
What are you talking about?

1:14:00.858 --> 1:14:03.628
I don't want to say
goodbye to you, Olivia.

1:14:07.465 --> 1:14:09.167
Happy birthday!

1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:31.222
Charlotte!

1:14:37.528 --> 1:14:40.231
You're leaving me, aren't you?

1:14:40.264 --> 1:14:42.367
No.

1:14:42.400 --> 1:14:43.868
I'm just gonna go
get some cigarettes.

1:14:43.901 --> 1:14:45.770
You won't come back.

1:14:45.803 --> 1:14:47.305
- I'll go.
- Don't be...

1:14:47.338 --> 1:14:50.308
- You been drinking.
- Fuck you, Charlotte.

1:14:52.877 --> 1:14:57.181
I know where you'd rather be.

1:14:57.215 --> 1:14:58.883
And I can't let you go there.

1:14:58.916 --> 1:15:00.318
We'll go together. Okay?

1:15:00.351 --> 1:15:01.686
Because we made a promise,
right?

1:15:01.719 --> 1:15:02.920
Of course.

1:15:02.954 --> 1:15:05.256
That we'd stay together...

1:15:07.659 --> 1:15:09.861
...that we'd keep
each other safe.

1:15:10.928 --> 1:15:12.497
Please.

1:15:14.332 --> 1:15:15.566
Okay.

1:15:20.371 --> 1:15:23.941
Can you get my shoes
from inside?

1:15:23.975 --> 1:15:25.276
Okay.

1:15:36.821 --> 1:15:40.925
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

I'm gonna go find Olivia.
It's been over an hour.

1:17:42.647 --> 1:17:44.048
- No.
- And she's not back yet.

1:17:44.081 --> 1:17:46.350
- No, no, no.
- She's not answering her phone.

1:17:46.384 --> 1:17:48.753
Y... You have a habit
of Irish goodbyes.

1:17:48.786 --> 1:17:50.922
I can't let you leave.

1:17:50.955 --> 1:17:52.957
I can't,
not without one last dance.

1:17:55.126 --> 1:17:57.795
- Charlotte.
- Get your hand off me.

1:18:03.134 --> 1:18:05.469
Charlotte?

1:18:06.637 --> 1:18:08.840
Hey, something...

1:18:21.118 --> 1:18:23.020
What happened?

1:18:23.054 --> 1:18:25.489
You fainted,
and you hit your head, baby.

1:18:25.523 --> 1:18:27.391
You're probably
gonna need stitches.

1:18:27.425 --> 1:18:29.627
I want you to try
and have some water, okay?

1:18:29.660 --> 1:18:32.029
Can you sit up for me?

1:18:33.198 --> 1:18:34.699
Close your eyes.

1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:38.135
Good.

1:18:38.170 --> 1:18:41.472
Okay. Hey...

1:18:41.505 --> 1:18:43.975
Lauren, what happened
to your clothes?

1:18:45.443 --> 1:18:47.645
Who are all these people?

1:18:47.678 --> 1:18:49.714
I don't know these people.

1:18:49.747 --> 1:18:54.018
Of course, you do, honey.
They're our friends.

1:18:54.051 --> 1:18:57.622
You don't know these people.

1:18:57.655 --> 1:18:59.123
These moths.

1:18:59.157 --> 1:19:02.560
I need to know what happened
to your clothes.

1:19:02.593 --> 1:19:05.029
Did somebody do this to you?

1:19:06.231 --> 1:19:07.465
The giant...

1:19:07.498 --> 1:19:08.499
What did you say?

1:19:08.532 --> 1:19:10.935
It's in the house.

1:19:19.644 --> 1:19:22.513
Where did you get that guitar?

1:19:22.546 --> 1:19:24.782
What?
It was just sitting here.

1:19:24.815 --> 1:19:26.784
That's not supposed to be here.

1:19:32.190 --> 1:19:34.558
- He's coming!
- This was a mistake.

1:19:34.592 --> 1:19:35.927
Coming!

1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:38.930
We shouldn't have come here.

1:19:38.963 --> 1:19:41.799
This is a bad place.

1:19:41.832 --> 1:19:45.770
- What's a bad place, honey?
- It's a bad place.

1:19:45.803 --> 1:19:49.040
What's a bad place?

1:19:57.748 --> 1:20:00.151
It's here.

1:20:03.154 --> 1:20:05.756
Lauren, honey.
Where are you going?

1:20:08.226 --> 1:20:10.162
What is he gonna do with you?

1:20:11.929 --> 1:20:15.167
Who?

1:20:15.200 --> 1:20:17.768
Whoever it is, it ain't me.

1:20:23.541 --> 1:20:24.709
Lauren?

1:20:32.016 --> 1:20:33.718
Oh, Charlotte!

1:20:33.751 --> 1:20:35.619
Sweetheart.
It's a jungle run.

1:20:35.653 --> 1:20:38.556
Alright!
Lose them clothes.

1:20:38.589 --> 1:20:41.193
Olivia's still out there.
Are you not worried?

1:20:41.226 --> 1:20:43.161
Uh...

1:20:43.195 --> 1:20:45.963
I am worried that you still
have your fucking clothes on.

1:20:49.834 --> 1:20:52.036
Lauren?

1:20:52.069 --> 1:20:54.206
You can't go.
You have to rest.

1:20:54.239 --> 1:20:56.040
It's all going to be alright,
Charlotte.

1:20:56.073 --> 1:20:57.008
No.

1:21:09.820 --> 1:21:12.556
Lauren.

1:21:21.366 --> 1:21:23.734
Taylor... please.

1:21:23.768 --> 1:21:28.739
What are you so afraid of?

1:21:28.773 --> 1:21:30.541
The dark?

1:21:35.046 --> 1:21:37.948
The Giant?

1:21:37.982 --> 1:21:40.017
I'll kill that
son of a bitch myself.

1:21:40.051 --> 1:21:43.587
Now let's fucking do this!

1:22:01.038 --> 1:22:03.808
You don't have to stay.

1:22:56.861 --> 1:22:58.696
Are you here?

1:23:59.191 --> 1:24:01.226
Do you have any idea
how much it hurts

1:24:01.259 --> 1:24:03.894
to see you look at me this way?

1:24:07.798 --> 1:24:09.301
I didn't know where else to go.

1:24:09.334 --> 1:24:11.802
I didn't think
you'd ever come back.

1:24:13.103 --> 1:24:16.040
They took my house...

1:24:16.073 --> 1:24:18.376
and my truck.

1:24:18.410 --> 1:24:20.378
No one...

1:24:23.415 --> 1:24:26.484
No one knows what to do
with people like me.

1:24:29.554 --> 1:24:32.390
People... People with nothing...

1:24:32.424 --> 1:24:34.192
with no one.

1:24:37.362 --> 1:24:39.197
And, um...

1:24:41.098 --> 1:24:42.800
it hurts.

1:24:42.833 --> 1:24:45.135
It hurts so much
that you just...

1:24:45.170 --> 1:24:47.805
you want someone else
to feel it, too.

1:24:52.310 --> 1:24:55.112
These holes I feel in my chest.

1:24:55.145 --> 1:24:56.981
Are you gonna hurt me?

1:25:07.425 --> 1:25:08.959
What happened to us?

1:25:16.468 --> 1:25:18.802
Joe, look at me.

1:25:22.207 --> 1:25:24.309
Look at me, please.

1:25:38.390 --> 1:25:41.526
I don't want you
to remember me this way.

1:25:45.129 --> 1:25:47.064
What do you see?

1:25:48.932 --> 1:25:51.202
I see something beautiful...

1:25:54.639 --> 1:25:58.310
...that's been broken in ways
that I can't imagine.

1:26:06.217 --> 1:26:08.886
Was it real that night?

1:26:08.919 --> 1:26:10.455
When you kissed me?

1:26:12.457 --> 1:26:14.492
It was all I ever wanted.

1:26:16.528 --> 1:26:20.365
I can still taste
the cigarettes on your lips.

1:26:23.435 --> 1:26:26.338
I can smell the fireworks
on your clothes.

1:26:29.240 --> 1:26:31.975
But I just can't tell now...

1:26:34.279 --> 1:26:36.648
...if I remember it...

1:26:36.681 --> 1:26:39.149
or if I was dreaming.

1:26:40.552 --> 1:26:42.853
What's the difference?

1:26:52.297 --> 1:26:54.566
I want you to show me.

1:27:18.256 --> 1:27:21.559
What happened to you
that night, Joe?

1:27:28.666 --> 1:27:31.068
All I wanted was for you
to see that I needed you...

1:27:31.101 --> 1:27:33.671
- That's not what I asked you.
- ...to come after me...

1:27:36.307 --> 1:27:39.544
...to pull me back.

1:27:39.577 --> 1:27:44.182
I wanted you back so bad, Joe.

1:27:44.215 --> 1:27:45.650
Please, don't.

1:27:45.683 --> 1:27:48.353
You're too late.

1:27:50.087 --> 1:27:53.658
You have to let me go.

1:27:53.691 --> 1:27:56.126
I'm sorry, Joe.
I have to go.

1:27:56.161 --> 1:27:58.263
Just tell me you heard it.

1:27:59.364 --> 1:28:01.499
Please.

1:28:01.533 --> 1:28:03.334
Just tell me you heard it.

1:28:03.368 --> 1:28:06.003
Tell me there's something left.

1:28:06.036 --> 1:28:07.739
It was thunder.

1:28:07.772 --> 1:28:09.307
No.

1:28:10.742 --> 1:28:12.677
You don't believe that.

1:28:15.078 --> 1:28:17.649
There's nothing out there.

1:28:17.682 --> 1:28:20.083
You need help.

1:28:20.117 --> 1:28:23.086
Then what are you so afraid of?

1:28:35.800 --> 1:28:39.069
What happened to you
that night, Joe?

1:28:44.342 --> 1:28:46.611
Don't you see what I see?

1:28:51.816 --> 1:28:54.552
Don't you hear what I hear?

1:29:02.393 --> 1:29:04.696
You thought it was just thunder.

1:29:09.400 --> 1:29:11.669
They're not coming back.

1:29:15.673 --> 1:29:19.611
What are you doing to me?

1:29:19.644 --> 1:29:21.346
I'm not.

1:29:21.379 --> 1:29:25.350
I can't breathe.

1:29:25.383 --> 1:29:27.785
Just tell me you heard them.

1:29:27.819 --> 1:29:30.421
You're hurting me.

1:29:30.455 --> 1:29:33.525
You're hurting me, Joe.

1:29:33.558 --> 1:29:36.361
I'm not touching you,
Charlotte.

1:32:34.806 --> 1:32:36.908
Olivia!

1:32:41.713 --> 1:32:43.314
Olivia!

1:32:46.617 --> 1:32:48.519
Olivia!

1:32:59.664 --> 1:33:01.666
Olivia!

1:33:04.402 --> 1:33:06.270
Wait!

1:33:10.608 --> 1:33:12.944
Wait.

1:33:12.977 --> 1:33:14.278
Olivia.
