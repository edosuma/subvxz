00:04.654 --> 00:06.929
- Do you love Dad?
- Of course I do.

00:06.954 --> 00:09.814
- Then why isn't he home?
- He's guiding people on Everest.

00:09.845 --> 00:10.931
This is a sick woman.

00:10.970 --> 00:14.025
- Who is in danger of harming herself.
- She's dehydrated.

00:14.079 --> 00:16.632
She's bleeding. She should be
under a doctor's care.

00:16.665 --> 00:18.034
Anyway. That was a long time ago.

00:18.068 --> 00:19.403
It was just after my friend died.

00:19.435 --> 00:20.704
- Julia?
- Yes.

00:20.737 --> 00:22.104
Julia?

00:22.138 --> 00:24.074
Crying on her knees?

00:24.106 --> 00:25.508
Weepy little bitch?

00:26.708 --> 00:28.511
Are you drinking the sangria?

00:28.545 --> 00:31.348
- Why?
- It's spiked with psilocybin.

00:31.381 --> 00:32.749
- Your sweatshirt.
- Oh, keep it.

00:32.781 --> 00:35.151
I don't want you to catch a cold
on the walk home.

00:35.184 --> 00:36.185
Hey, stranger.

00:37.714 --> 00:39.355
Andy.

00:43.860 --> 00:47.564
A. Activating Incident.

00:47.596 --> 00:50.399
B. Belief System.

00:50.433 --> 00:53.604
C. Consequences.

00:55.104 --> 00:57.641
So... what happened?

00:59.476 --> 01:02.312
Sebastian, stay present.

01:02.345 --> 01:03.983
Let's go through this.

01:04.846 --> 01:07.416
A.

01:07.449 --> 01:09.351
Activating Incident.

01:09.385 --> 01:12.522
- A woman rejected me.
- And B?

01:12.555 --> 01:15.258
Belief? I'm worthless.

01:15.291 --> 01:19.129
- C?
- Consequences.

01:19.162 --> 01:22.833
I sit in my room and surf porn.

01:22.865 --> 01:25.367
And that brings us to D.

01:25.401 --> 01:27.104
What's D?

01:27.136 --> 01:28.404
Destruction.

01:29.439 --> 01:32.508
Destroy old thinking.

01:32.541 --> 01:36.079
And then we can talk about
the next step.

01:39.382 --> 01:41.385
Hey, stranger.

01:43.653 --> 01:45.321
Andy.

01:45.354 --> 01:47.490
Yeah.

01:47.523 --> 01:51.083
Oh, my God, you look fantastic.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.677
When did you get in?
Wh-Why didn't you call?

01:53.729 --> 01:55.153
I wanted to surprise you.

01:55.216 --> 01:58.235
Oh, my God, that's crazy.
I would've picked you up.

01:58.267 --> 02:00.204
I know that. Oh...

02:01.638 --> 02:05.175
- Mm.
- Look at this.

02:05.207 --> 02:06.579
Oh, yeah, I'm getting my hermit license.

02:06.604 --> 02:07.531
You like it?

02:07.556 --> 02:09.845
I thought you were still
trying to summit.

02:09.870 --> 02:11.023
Yeah, no, the weather wasn't improving.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.134
Oh, come on.

02:12.159 --> 02:14.183
- This was the best November ever.
- Yeah, I just...

02:15.251 --> 02:17.139
Okay, I missed you guys.

02:17.194 --> 02:19.656
And I didn't want to miss
the next doctor's appointment

02:19.688 --> 02:21.382
for Laura's heart.

02:26.261 --> 02:28.797
Oh, my God. Where'd you get this?

02:28.831 --> 02:29.966
This is like a tent on you.

02:29.998 --> 02:32.058
Uh, nowhere, just a co-worker.

02:32.082 --> 02:33.103
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

02:33.128 --> 02:34.424
What is this?

02:34.425 --> 02:37.407
Uh, this is just an artist,
he painted this t-shirt for me.

02:37.439 --> 02:39.808
What kind of work have you been doing?

02:39.842 --> 02:43.680
I'm sorry. My brain is just
a little bit bubbly.

02:43.712 --> 02:45.281
That's okay. You okay?

02:45.314 --> 02:46.348
Yeah.

02:46.382 --> 02:48.350
- Where's Mom?
- She's, uh, she left.

02:48.384 --> 02:49.868
She was...

02:49.899 --> 02:52.438
- Did you two fight?
- No.

02:52.493 --> 02:54.954
- No. Actually, we found a dÃ©tente.
- Really?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.938
- Yeah.
- Tell me more.

02:56.963 --> 02:59.539
I can't. Unfortunately...

03:01.563 --> 03:03.199
No, no, no, no, no.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.978
You guys are up way past your bedtime.

03:05.041 --> 03:06.806
Daddy said we could stay up.

03:06.837 --> 03:08.182
I never said that.

03:08.206 --> 03:10.283
My God, you guys have become such liars.

03:10.308 --> 03:11.219
All right!

03:11.243 --> 03:13.338
- Okay!
- I need you all to go upstairs right now.

03:13.363 --> 03:15.540
Let's go. The Tibetan
band can play tomorrow.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:28.624 --> 03:30.961
You look happier.

03:30.993 --> 03:32.729
It's been a weird time.

03:32.761 --> 03:35.966
Yeah. I heard.

03:35.998 --> 03:37.266
New job?

03:37.300 --> 03:39.960
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah.

03:39.985 --> 03:41.321
It's exciting.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.440
You know how we always talked about

03:44.474 --> 03:46.196
not wanting to work in an office

03:46.243 --> 03:50.140
or knowing exactly
what our day was gonna bring?

03:50.187 --> 03:52.749
- Mm-hmm.
- This is that.

03:52.782 --> 03:54.562
Just always surprised.

03:55.859 --> 03:57.476
I'm glad. Are you high?

03:59.855 --> 04:01.323
Yeah.

04:01.356 --> 04:03.325
- Yeah.
- Is that part of the work, too?

04:03.359 --> 04:05.795
Somebody spiked the sangria

04:05.827 --> 04:07.497
with some psilocybin

04:07.529 --> 04:09.472
without telling us.

04:09.542 --> 04:12.308
- Us?
- Yeah, my co-worker.

04:12.701 --> 04:14.190
Ah.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.706
Interesting.

04:42.117 --> 04:44.149
Like a baby's ass.

04:44.196 --> 04:46.736
Mm, that's what I like. Sexy talk.

04:52.186 --> 04:54.694
This is what I suggest.

04:54.750 --> 04:57.854
- I'm gonna throw you on the bed.
- Oh, yeah?

04:57.909 --> 04:59.147
And I'm gonna ravish you.

04:59.178 --> 05:01.484
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

05:01.539 --> 05:02.976
Now carry me into the bedroom.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.480
Oh. You got more demanding.

05:05.574 --> 05:07.437
You don't know the half of it.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.774
What's wrong?

05:24.807 --> 05:27.644
- Did you hear that?
- What?

05:27.677 --> 05:30.667
- Something in the hall.
- I didn't hear anything.

05:32.882 --> 05:34.088
I heard that.

05:34.149 --> 05:36.752
Wait, wait, wait wait, wait.

05:42.237 --> 05:43.838
- You're kidding.
- What?

05:43.902 --> 05:46.205
The girls have me paranoid
with what's been happening here.

05:46.248 --> 05:48.422
That's great, if there's an ice wall,
we'll be ready.

05:48.446 --> 05:49.813
Yeah.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.069
- Shh.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

05:59.115 --> 06:01.045
- What is it?
- It's nothing. It's just...

06:07.254 --> 06:09.390
I think we're all dreaming.

06:09.439 --> 06:10.952
Maybe we should call 911.

06:11.019 --> 06:14.218
Shh. Stay-stay back.

06:14.299 --> 06:16.022
Stay back, stay back, stay back.

06:19.278 --> 06:20.446
- What's that?
- Oh, it's a kitty!

06:20.480 --> 06:21.872
It's a stray. It's a stray.
No, no, no, leave it there.

06:21.911 --> 06:23.650
Don't touch it, don't touch it,
it might have ticks.

06:23.682 --> 06:26.638
- Mom, the cat's so cute!
- Yeah, but leave her.

06:26.716 --> 06:27.920
How do you know she's a her?

06:27.954 --> 06:28.821
Because all cats are her.

06:28.855 --> 06:30.557
- That's not true.
- Okay. Off to bed, please.

06:30.590 --> 06:31.925
- You literally said, "She's a her."
- Off to bed.

06:31.958 --> 06:34.135
Off to bed.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.431
- You have to feed the cat.
- No.

06:38.463 --> 06:40.456
Go to sleep. We will deal with this.

06:40.481 --> 06:42.511
All of our fish died. We need a cat now.

06:42.558 --> 06:44.448
- We'll talk about it.
- They live longer, nine lives.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.917
- Please.
- Okay, come on.

06:47.628 --> 06:50.769
- We can't have a pet.
- I know we can't.

06:50.823 --> 06:53.278
I'll just put it in the garage
for tonight, and we'll see.

06:56.866 --> 06:58.668
He's not letting go of this
thing. Could you hold it?

06:58.700 --> 07:00.966
He just wants the sweater. Just...

07:02.349 --> 07:04.273
There we go. I got you.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.982
- David Acosta?
- Yeah?

07:13.015 --> 07:14.250
You've been served.

07:14.282 --> 07:17.753
- Why?
- My guess is someone's suing you.

07:17.787 --> 07:19.121
Have a nice day.

07:24.260 --> 07:26.962
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:26.996 --> 07:29.065
How's your head today?

07:29.097 --> 07:30.799
My... Oh.

07:30.833 --> 07:33.970
Uh, yeah. Better.

07:34.003 --> 07:37.674
- My husband's home.
- That's great.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.944
- Can I...
- Oh. Yeah, sure. Yeah, please.

07:45.080 --> 07:46.913
I got a subpoena this morning.

07:48.049 --> 07:50.898
Really? For what?

07:50.952 --> 07:53.765
- The Hopkins exorcism.
- Who's suing, the husband?

07:53.820 --> 07:54.976
No. Caroline.

07:57.092 --> 07:59.027
She says the Church
botched the exorcism.

07:59.061 --> 08:00.697
Says we should've deferred

08:00.729 --> 08:02.097
to the psychologist on the scene

08:02.131 --> 08:04.767
and sought medical care.

08:04.799 --> 08:06.635
She's suing Father Amara,

08:06.669 --> 08:08.305
myself, and the archdiocese.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.210
Anyway, I just wanted to make
sure we got our facts straight,

08:14.243 --> 08:15.506
because we disagreed that night.

08:15.553 --> 08:19.082
- But since...
- David, have you spoken to your lawyer?

08:19.114 --> 08:22.443
- I don't have a lawyer.
- The Church is gonna get you one.

08:22.498 --> 08:25.261
Before you and I talk,
you need to speak to your lawyer.

08:25.308 --> 08:27.390
- Did you get a subpoena?
- No, but I probably will,

08:27.422 --> 08:29.417
because they'll use my testimony
against you.

08:29.488 --> 08:31.886
That's why I wanted to know
how much we disagree...

08:31.949 --> 08:34.097
David, I'm-I'm sorry.

08:34.130 --> 08:37.667
Whatever we say right now,
I will be asked about.

08:37.698 --> 08:38.700
And they'll want to know

08:38.780 --> 08:40.817
if we tried to get our stories straight.

08:41.351 --> 08:42.934
That'll make you look worse.

08:42.982 --> 08:44.872
So you need to be able to swear

08:44.935 --> 08:46.888
that we didn't get our stories straight.

08:46.958 --> 08:48.076
Right now, I can say

08:48.110 --> 08:51.246
that we talked. You asked me
if I was subpoenaed,

08:51.280 --> 08:53.649
and our conversation lasted
exactly five minutes.

08:53.712 --> 08:56.024
If this goes any further,
I'll be under oath,

08:56.079 --> 08:58.188
and have to admit to more.

09:02.077 --> 09:03.327
I understand.

09:35.123 --> 09:36.325
Hello?

09:36.358 --> 09:38.927
Did you know you have a bird up there?

09:38.960 --> 09:40.762
Yes.

09:40.795 --> 09:42.732
He doesn't want to leave.

09:42.765 --> 09:44.133
May I help you?

09:44.165 --> 09:46.969
Bishop Marx. Your new superior.

09:47.002 --> 09:50.105
So, you're a seminarian?

09:50.138 --> 09:51.974
- I am.
- How many years?

09:52.007 --> 09:53.008
This is my third.

09:53.042 --> 09:56.044
Uh, two years philosophy,
one more year theology.

09:56.078 --> 09:58.396
There's jealousy here that
you've been given free reign.

09:58.443 --> 10:00.256
I don't know what that means.

10:00.281 --> 10:02.884
Monsignor Korecki kept a firm hand

10:02.917 --> 10:04.820
- on all the assessments.
- And yet we're being sued.

10:04.878 --> 10:07.389
Yes. It's unfortunate.

10:07.423 --> 10:08.791
So, David.

10:08.824 --> 10:11.485
I've been moved here
as bishop of the diocese

10:11.524 --> 10:13.149
for one very particular reason.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.663
- Do you want to know what it is?
- I do.

10:15.930 --> 10:18.334
You have drawn the attention
of the Holy Father.

10:20.902 --> 10:23.906
That is not necessarily a good thing.

10:25.422 --> 10:27.392
The Vatican assessors believe

10:27.460 --> 10:29.171
you're doing important work here, but...

10:29.226 --> 10:31.314
Oh.

10:31.347 --> 10:33.683
Flannery O'Connor.

10:34.457 --> 10:35.559
I love her.

10:36.077 --> 10:37.445
Yes.

10:37.509 --> 10:39.291
But you're being sued.

10:39.316 --> 10:41.690
So I should hire a lawyer?

10:41.723 --> 10:43.900
No. An archdiocesan lawyer

10:43.955 --> 10:45.433
already volunteered to represent you.

10:49.765 --> 10:51.701
She's not a litigator, she's a fixer.

10:51.733 --> 10:54.203
She's kept our abuse victim
lawsuits reasonable.

10:54.236 --> 10:57.874
We want her to do the same thing here.

11:03.405 --> 11:05.311
David Acosta.

11:05.366 --> 11:07.139
Renee Harris.

11:07.194 --> 11:08.817
You two know each other?

11:08.851 --> 11:11.054
That's why I volunteered.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.756
So it looks like you're in trouble.

11:13.789 --> 11:16.126
We should get started.

01x09 - <i>Exorcism Part 2</i>

11:28.485 --> 11:30.737
And now I'm going to teach you
the two most magical words

11:30.784 --> 11:32.820
in the English language.

11:32.852 --> 11:34.988
As if.

11:35.021 --> 11:38.291
You're going to the Fit 4 Women's gym

11:38.324 --> 11:40.694
and you will be carrying this.

11:44.463 --> 11:47.767
- What is that?
- A gun.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.902
- This is a gun?
- Yes.

11:49.935 --> 11:51.771
You'll go there, you'll aim,

11:51.804 --> 11:54.507
you'll shoot "as if"

11:54.540 --> 11:56.743
you could really do it.

12:00.547 --> 12:03.216
But I get it if you don't want to.

12:12.058 --> 12:13.391
You look good.

12:13.446 --> 12:15.496
You do too.

12:15.529 --> 12:17.998
So, the priesthood?

12:18.030 --> 12:20.700
- Are you surprised?
- That wasn't your thing.

12:20.733 --> 12:22.935
It wasn't your thing to be
a church lawyer either.

12:22.968 --> 12:26.472
My sister screwed us both up.

12:26.505 --> 12:28.475
She got you to promise, too?

12:28.507 --> 12:29.876
On her death bed.

12:29.909 --> 12:31.944
"The church needs you."

12:31.977 --> 12:34.681
She probably told everybody
the same thing that last day.

12:34.715 --> 12:36.650
That's Julia for you...

12:36.683 --> 12:40.219
always has to have the last
word, even from the grave.

12:41.587 --> 12:42.655
God, I loved her.

12:44.658 --> 12:47.794
Come in.

12:47.827 --> 12:49.395
Where are we?

12:49.428 --> 12:50.831
It's a nuisance suit.

12:50.864 --> 12:52.499
We don't want it to go to trial.

12:52.531 --> 12:54.286
- I'll get it kicked in depo.
- And David?

12:54.317 --> 12:56.469
He'll be a good witness.

12:56.502 --> 12:59.208
My worry is the psychiatrist and
the psychologist who were there,

12:59.271 --> 13:00.573
but I'll talk to them.

13:00.606 --> 13:02.976
Uh, just as a warning, I tried to speak

13:03.009 --> 13:04.912
- with one of them this morning.
- You did?

13:04.944 --> 13:06.779
Yes, uh, Kristen Bouchard.

13:06.813 --> 13:08.448
She's on my team.

13:08.481 --> 13:10.885
She stopped me before
I could say anything.

13:12.486 --> 13:14.587
Okay, smart girl. I'll talk to her.

13:14.621 --> 13:15.823
It'll probably be fine.

13:17.857 --> 13:20.093
How you doing?

13:22.129 --> 13:25.599
- I hate depositions.
- Yeah.

13:25.631 --> 13:27.000
I hate law offices.

13:27.033 --> 13:28.369
Dr. Bouchard.

13:28.401 --> 13:30.803
Hi. It's just Kristen.

13:30.837 --> 13:32.806
You have a doctorate.
That deserves a "Dr."

13:32.838 --> 13:35.641
Hi. Renee Harris,
lawyer for the defense.

13:35.674 --> 13:37.323
This is Ben Shakir. He works with us.

13:37.377 --> 13:38.578
- Hi.
- As?

13:38.611 --> 13:40.646
A contractor.

13:40.679 --> 13:42.791
Is that a joke?

13:43.549 --> 13:44.984
No.

13:45.018 --> 13:48.021
Okay. Do you have a jacket with that?

13:48.053 --> 13:50.790
With this? Uh, yes, but not with me.

13:50.823 --> 13:52.659
- Can someone get it for you?
- Why?

13:52.692 --> 13:54.361
I want you to look like a doctor.

13:54.432 --> 13:56.496
A jacket will make me
look like a doctor?

13:56.529 --> 13:57.698
Yes.

13:59.322 --> 14:01.568
- All right, yeah. I can make a call.
- Please do.

14:01.601 --> 14:04.266
David told me you stopped him
from pulling a Clinton,

14:04.305 --> 14:05.472
getting your stories straight.

14:05.505 --> 14:07.408
I see you have some
familiarity with court.

14:07.441 --> 14:08.609
That will be helpful.

14:08.641 --> 14:10.576
I'm not telling you how to testify.

14:10.610 --> 14:13.514
I'm just telling you
the other side is smart.

14:13.547 --> 14:14.847
Judith Lemonhead.

14:14.901 --> 14:17.136
Lemonhead?

14:17.182 --> 14:19.245
Yes, I know. Stupid name,
and she's angry about it,

14:19.300 --> 14:20.761
wants to take it out on the world.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.436
She will try to get you
to elaborate on your answers.

14:23.498 --> 14:25.925
Don't. Answer "yes," "no,"

14:25.958 --> 14:27.861
and "Can you be more specific?"

14:27.894 --> 14:30.530
- You and David work together?
- Yes.

14:30.563 --> 14:32.337
Has he talked to you about Julia?

14:32.400 --> 14:34.009
Yeah.

14:34.064 --> 14:35.702
I'm her sister.

14:35.735 --> 14:37.971
She was the idealistic one.

14:38.004 --> 14:40.707
I'm the cynic, which
makes me perfect for this.

14:40.740 --> 14:42.576
When you want a break
in the questioning,

14:42.608 --> 14:44.610
put your fingers to your nose like this,

14:44.644 --> 14:47.454
and I will ask for a break
because my leg hurts.

14:47.516 --> 14:49.157
I injured it.

14:52.649 --> 14:54.750
Did you injure it?

14:54.777 --> 14:57.013
No.

14:59.192 --> 15:00.694
<i>And the wicked shall perish</i>

15:00.741 --> 15:03.529
<i>- in the presence of God...
- No!</i>

15:03.563 --> 15:05.499
<i>Out! Out! Out!</i>

15:06.699 --> 15:08.601
- Is that you, Caroline?
- Yes.

15:08.635 --> 15:11.572
<i>Out! Ou...</i>

15:11.605 --> 15:14.007
And that sound... was that a slap?

15:14.039 --> 15:15.608
- Yes.
- Excuse me.

15:15.641 --> 15:16.995
Were you told that sound was a slap

15:17.075 --> 15:19.308
or do you have a specific memory
that was a slap?

15:20.746 --> 15:22.002
Um...

15:22.065 --> 15:23.284
Let the record reflect the witness

15:23.338 --> 15:24.612
just looked to her lawyer for guidance.

15:24.660 --> 15:27.442
All right, let's just ask
your clients then.

15:27.497 --> 15:29.689
Did you slap Caroline in that moment?

15:29.722 --> 15:32.708
No. Uh, Caroline was trying
to break free of her bonds.

15:32.733 --> 15:33.736
And why was she bound?

15:33.796 --> 15:35.128
Because she was trying to kill people.

15:35.161 --> 15:37.124
Then let's just listen
to this part of the tape.

15:37.179 --> 15:38.411
<i>What is your name?</i>

15:38.473 --> 15:41.863
<i>In the name of God, I demand your name.</i>

15:41.951 --> 15:44.086
<i>Help me.</i>

15:44.159 --> 15:47.350
If you want to feel bad,
go to confession, not here.

15:47.420 --> 15:49.533
And after you pled
for your life, Caroline,

15:49.566 --> 15:51.772
- did anyone do anything?
- No.

15:51.819 --> 15:53.035
And after they told you that

15:53.068 --> 15:55.171
the demons had been exorcised,
what happened?

15:55.204 --> 15:58.474
I was fine for a week,
then I fell apart.

15:58.507 --> 16:02.044
I... suffered delusions,

16:02.077 --> 16:03.813
paranoia, uh,

16:03.847 --> 16:06.549
depression.

16:06.574 --> 16:07.697
I wanted to die.

16:09.151 --> 16:11.259
I was taken to the emergency room

16:11.306 --> 16:13.407
and I got some real help.

16:13.470 --> 16:15.559
Dr. Phillip Lynch-Giles.

16:15.592 --> 16:17.561
Uh, I specialize in treating patients

16:17.593 --> 16:19.862
with dissociative disorders
and schizophrenia.

16:19.895 --> 16:22.197
And what was the physical
and mental condition

16:22.267 --> 16:24.619
of Caroline Hopkins

16:24.697 --> 16:26.955
after the... exorcism

16:27.002 --> 16:28.637
October 31?

16:28.670 --> 16:32.494
Lacerations, bruising,
suicidal ideation.

16:32.526 --> 16:34.661
Uh, she was malnourished, dehydrated,

16:34.694 --> 16:36.563
unable to stand or walk.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.221
And what was your medical diagnosis?

16:38.276 --> 16:39.854
Dissociative identity disorder,

16:39.901 --> 16:42.136
but she was also severely delusional,

16:42.169 --> 16:45.039
uh, convinced that
Satan and other demons

16:45.072 --> 16:46.639
were following and attacking her.

16:46.686 --> 16:48.827
- How are those delusions?
- Seriously, Renee?

16:48.913 --> 16:51.517
What? Let him answer the question.

16:51.579 --> 16:54.946
I would say that
demonic forces do not exist,

16:54.988 --> 16:57.123
and patients often use the crutch

16:57.148 --> 16:58.984
of the metaphoric to explain and deny

16:59.031 --> 17:01.580
- what are actually mental disabilities.
- Which is your bias?

17:01.605 --> 17:04.463
Uh, no, that's the shared understanding

17:04.502 --> 17:06.109
- of the medical community.
- And what was

17:06.142 --> 17:08.507
your treatment plan
for Caroline, Doctor?

17:08.546 --> 17:11.065
Chlorpromazine and aripiprazole

17:11.097 --> 17:13.133
in order to limit the psychosis.

17:13.166 --> 17:16.170
The dissociative behavior
is more difficult

17:16.202 --> 17:18.137
I use a...

17:18.171 --> 17:20.307
trauma conceptualization exercise.

17:20.340 --> 17:23.210
I have the patient mentally
process what happened to them

17:23.243 --> 17:25.246
without disassociating from it.

17:25.278 --> 17:29.182
- What do you think?
- It's standard.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.352
Ms. Bouchard...

17:31.384 --> 17:35.022
- Dr. Bouchard.
- Sure.

17:35.056 --> 17:37.758
You were called as
a psychologist to assess

17:37.792 --> 17:40.367
whether Caroline was suffering
from a mental disorder.

17:40.414 --> 17:41.422
Yes.

17:41.469 --> 17:43.680
And what was your
professional observation?

17:43.725 --> 17:45.196
That she was ill.

17:45.242 --> 17:47.200
Uh, can you elaborate?

17:47.233 --> 17:49.670
That she was mentally ill.

17:49.703 --> 17:52.172
- Hm.
- I see.

17:52.206 --> 17:56.210
Uh, did Ms. Harris
prep you for this testimony?

17:56.242 --> 17:58.445
- Yes.
- And what did she say?

17:58.479 --> 18:00.687
She told me to be honest and concise.

18:00.719 --> 18:02.282
And did she say anything about me?

18:02.316 --> 18:04.429
Yes, she told me that you
hated your last name

18:04.476 --> 18:05.860
and wanted to take it out on the world.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.039
- Oh.
- Okay.

18:10.458 --> 18:12.737
Uh, did you not call in
a licensed psychiatrist

18:12.761 --> 18:14.627
to this exorcism, Dr. Bouchard?

18:14.698 --> 18:16.963
- Yes.
- And why did you do that?

18:16.997 --> 18:18.393
To consult.

18:18.448 --> 18:20.088
And what was the result
of that consultation?

18:20.112 --> 18:22.752
- He agreed.
- He agreed that Caroline

18:22.799 --> 18:24.213
was likely suffering from

18:24.275 --> 18:26.650
dissociative identity disorder
or schizophrenia?

18:26.705 --> 18:27.838
Yes.

18:27.885 --> 18:31.145
And did you both recommend that
the priest stop the exorcism?

18:35.316 --> 18:36.284
Yes.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.385
And did the Church follow
your recommendation?

18:40.488 --> 18:41.788
No.

18:41.822 --> 18:43.925
Why not?

18:43.958 --> 18:46.360
They disagreed.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.710
And, knowing all that you
know now, Dr. Bouchard,

18:48.780 --> 18:51.398
do you believe that
Caroline was possessed?

18:54.264 --> 18:55.897
Well, I don't believe in possession.

18:57.080 --> 19:00.274
Thank you. That was very helpful.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.298
When did you decide
to become a priest, sir?

19:02.369 --> 19:05.174
- Three years ago.
- You don't seem like the priest type.

19:05.228 --> 19:06.674
Why did you decide to become one?

19:06.724 --> 19:09.093
I found...

19:09.182 --> 19:11.919
I find comfort in my religion.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.268
Was there something in particular

19:13.316 --> 19:16.209
that you needed comfort
from three years ago?

19:16.270 --> 19:18.673
Um, uh, can you be more specific?

19:18.701 --> 19:19.975
Have you ever been arrested?

19:22.462 --> 19:24.061
Yes.

19:24.115 --> 19:25.399
On what grounds?

19:25.431 --> 19:28.268
Uh, once for possession.

19:28.302 --> 19:30.772
Once for assault.

19:30.805 --> 19:33.240
Possession of drugs? Which drug?

19:33.274 --> 19:35.008
Cocaine.

19:35.042 --> 19:36.477
- Are you a drug addict?
- No.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.764
The documents in that folder detail

19:39.811 --> 19:43.184
three two-month stays
at a rehabilitation facility

19:43.217 --> 19:46.487
in Pennsylvania between 2010 and 2014.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.422
Substance abuse
and sex addiction support.

19:53.294 --> 19:55.263
I had some issues

19:55.296 --> 19:58.165
with, um, drugs

19:58.199 --> 20:00.433
and...

20:00.467 --> 20:02.469
intimacy.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.505
I cleaned myself up.

20:05.471 --> 20:06.574
I found God.

20:06.606 --> 20:09.009
The police report on your assault charge

20:09.043 --> 20:11.344
says that you knocked a man unconscious.

20:11.368 --> 20:13.312
Did you also have issues with anger?

20:13.359 --> 20:14.615
Ms. Lemonhead,

20:14.649 --> 20:16.327
feel free to get to the point
with these questions.

20:16.374 --> 20:18.518
My point is that Mr. Acosta
has a pattern

20:18.552 --> 20:19.620
of making reckless decisions

20:19.652 --> 20:22.422
that endanger both his life
and the lives of others.

20:22.461 --> 20:24.898
I'm fairly certain a judge
would find that relevant.

20:24.961 --> 20:27.140
Now, may I continue, or
should we call the judge?

20:27.211 --> 20:28.523
Go ahead and embarrass yourself.

20:30.264 --> 20:33.568
Mr. Acosta, in your role as
a representative of the Church,

20:33.601 --> 20:35.907
do you ever disclose your
background to those you serve?

20:37.337 --> 20:39.373
No.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.454
Do you think Caroline Hopkins
would've allowed you

20:42.501 --> 20:45.627
to assist in her exorcism
had she known your history?

20:48.883 --> 20:50.484
I'm not sure.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.026
We need to do something.

20:52.083 --> 20:54.323
Yeah, I agree.

20:54.387 --> 20:55.923
Let's talk.

21:05.020 --> 21:06.989
Hello. How may I help you?

21:07.050 --> 21:08.277
I'd like to attend a class.

21:08.324 --> 21:10.845
I don't want to assume your gender,

21:10.900 --> 21:12.428
but this is a women's-only gym.

21:12.461 --> 21:14.822
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.

21:16.732 --> 21:18.600
I'm a man.

21:18.634 --> 21:22.338
And you know this is the
definition of sexism. Right?

21:22.372 --> 21:23.373
There's another gym down the street

21:23.405 --> 21:25.475
that you'd be welcome to attend.

21:25.508 --> 21:26.905
Excuse me. Have a good day.

21:26.944 --> 21:28.411
Fit 4 Women.

21:28.443 --> 21:31.647
The 9:30 is completely booked.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.317
I can add you to a wait list...

21:42.759 --> 21:45.495
Destroy the past.

21:55.070 --> 21:57.006
Eight million dollars.

21:58.040 --> 21:59.775
I would call that a confident ask.

21:59.808 --> 22:02.345
It is. Ms. Lemonhead thinks
she has us on the run.

22:02.377 --> 22:03.413
Does she?

22:03.445 --> 22:05.280
Yes. They also want Father Amara

22:05.314 --> 22:06.583
removed from the priesthood

22:06.615 --> 22:09.183
and a promise that David Acosta
will not be ordained.

22:09.208 --> 22:11.487
- So, what do we do?
- I told them we needed

22:11.520 --> 22:13.423
a day to consider a counter.

22:23.066 --> 22:24.468
Yeah?

22:32.442 --> 22:34.924
We'll rebuff the attempt
to block the ordination.

22:36.612 --> 22:39.392
If it costs the Church money, don't.

22:41.284 --> 22:45.188
David.

22:46.489 --> 22:48.258
How will I say this?

22:48.290 --> 22:51.360
I'm just gonna come out and say it.

22:51.394 --> 22:53.396
Okay.

22:55.110 --> 22:56.743
I've always had a crush on you.

22:56.805 --> 22:59.405
That whole time.

22:59.439 --> 23:02.276
You and Julia.

23:02.308 --> 23:04.829
That's why I had
to stay away from you two.

23:04.891 --> 23:08.316
I just... I couldn't show it.

23:09.281 --> 23:11.585
And now...

23:11.617 --> 23:15.021
when I saw you yesterday...

23:15.055 --> 23:17.991
I realized my problem
wasn't my sister anymore.

23:18.025 --> 23:20.627
It was... God.

23:20.660 --> 23:23.197
Can you believe that?

23:23.230 --> 23:25.231
God.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.643
Do you ever think of me?

23:37.243 --> 23:38.478
Ever?

24:06.847 --> 24:09.276
- I should...
- What?

24:09.940 --> 24:11.347
Go?

24:12.003 --> 24:13.291
This is your place.

24:14.647 --> 24:18.284
Uh, I should, um...

24:18.317 --> 24:20.488
I should study.

24:23.824 --> 24:25.292
Yep.

24:27.693 --> 24:30.397
One of the dangers
of living next to a church.

24:31.530 --> 24:33.533
It's hard to get laid.

24:39.439 --> 24:41.366
David?

24:41.452 --> 24:44.671
There are other ways
to serve the Church.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.764
You don't need to marry it.

24:58.157 --> 25:00.359
I'm calling the ASPCA.

25:03.864 --> 25:05.437
Bad day?

25:05.468 --> 25:06.834
Not the best.

25:06.866 --> 25:09.135
Too many demons to fight?

25:09.170 --> 25:11.148
The kids were talking about

25:11.195 --> 25:12.687
all your, uh, adventures.

25:12.742 --> 25:15.537
Exorcisms and chasing demons.

25:15.592 --> 25:17.146
It sounds exciting.

25:17.185 --> 25:18.849
It's not as exciting as it sounds.

25:20.826 --> 25:22.560
Is that why you were given a rosary?

25:22.602 --> 25:23.570
What?

25:23.615 --> 25:28.160
The, uh, the rosary in the garage.

25:28.230 --> 25:30.566
What are you trying to ask me, Andy?

25:30.636 --> 25:32.425
I don't know.
I mean, who gave it to you?

25:32.459 --> 25:33.928
Was it Ben the Magnificent?

25:33.961 --> 25:35.329
- No.
- So...

25:35.361 --> 25:37.197
I don't need to worry about him?

25:38.432 --> 25:39.599
No, you don't.

25:39.633 --> 25:42.403
No, okay. Okay.

25:47.307 --> 25:49.543
Hey, are you becoming unlapsed, babe?

25:49.576 --> 25:51.178
What?

25:51.211 --> 25:53.213
Am I...

25:55.715 --> 25:57.216
No.

25:57.250 --> 25:59.286
Okay. Okay.

25:59.319 --> 26:00.684
Good.

26:03.056 --> 26:04.258
Is there a problem if I were?

26:06.059 --> 26:09.195
- If you were becoming unlapsed?
- Yeah.

26:09.229 --> 26:11.598
Yeah. Maybe.

26:11.630 --> 26:13.333
I mean, the same kind of problem
we'd have

26:13.367 --> 26:15.703
if you tried to cure
the girls' colds with leeches.

26:15.735 --> 26:17.704
It's superstitious.

26:17.729 --> 26:19.904
Those are your words, not mine.

26:21.675 --> 26:23.978
Well, I heard a doctor today
talking about prescribing

26:24.011 --> 26:27.844
chlorpromazine and aripiprazole
and trauma exercises,

26:27.891 --> 26:30.063
and I realized it sounded
just as much like leeches.

26:30.126 --> 26:31.428
It sounded...

26:34.235 --> 26:35.838
What?

26:37.216 --> 26:39.357
What?

26:43.005 --> 26:45.232
- What?
- Hold on.

26:45.264 --> 26:46.733
Ben?

26:46.767 --> 26:48.772
I need you to look
into something for me.

26:48.827 --> 26:52.605
So, what I'm thinking,
in this whole business...

26:55.848 --> 26:58.654
I just went in and
pointed at ten of them.

26:58.686 --> 27:01.131
They were so upset they sent
the security guard after me.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.923
How did that make you feel?

27:05.010 --> 27:06.445
Excited.

27:06.510 --> 27:08.963
Strong. Really good.

27:10.579 --> 27:12.581
Good.

27:14.312 --> 27:15.795
Good work.

27:18.160 --> 27:20.163
Now what?

27:27.495 --> 27:29.331
The next step

27:29.399 --> 27:32.030
is putting "as if" into action,

27:32.085 --> 27:35.178
and I'm not sure you're ready for that.

27:36.296 --> 27:38.230
True self-esteem

27:38.264 --> 27:41.068
requires true action.

27:41.115 --> 27:42.722
There are some people

27:42.779 --> 27:45.310
who walk up to the line...

27:45.801 --> 27:47.801
then have to turn back.

27:50.410 --> 27:53.079
Then there are the few

27:53.112 --> 27:56.283
who are willing to cross that line.

27:56.315 --> 27:59.385
Which are you?

28:00.219 --> 28:03.322
- I bought a gun.
- I know.

28:03.355 --> 28:06.459
But do you know how to use it?

28:06.491 --> 28:09.363
And you're gonna need more than one.

28:13.333 --> 28:15.235
What if I practiced?

28:25.010 --> 28:27.013
Adam.

28:30.869 --> 28:32.518
This is Adam.

28:32.552 --> 28:34.487
He's a marksman.

28:34.519 --> 28:36.388
He's a good man.

28:36.421 --> 28:39.386
He's one of the 59 people
I trust in the world.

28:39.456 --> 28:40.591
Hi.

28:40.651 --> 28:42.481
He's here to help.

28:42.526 --> 28:44.428
So, if you're serious,

28:44.482 --> 28:48.315
he will help you become
proficient with guns.

28:50.261 --> 28:53.987
So, this is your red pill moment.

28:54.065 --> 28:56.434
Which way do you want to go?

29:01.438 --> 29:03.207
I don't have time for this, Leland.

29:03.241 --> 29:04.818
Wait.

29:06.311 --> 29:08.513
Give him a moment.

29:14.084 --> 29:16.987
- Cute little office.
- Thank you.

29:17.021 --> 29:18.290
What's that?

29:18.322 --> 29:19.640
I used to be a climber.

29:19.687 --> 29:21.194
Ah, I wouldn't have guessed.

29:21.233 --> 29:23.202
So, you wanted to talk...

29:23.242 --> 29:25.144
Holy crap! What was that?

29:25.177 --> 29:26.212
It's a cat.

29:26.244 --> 29:27.647
Sounds like a demon.

29:27.679 --> 29:31.325
No, it's just a cat who doesn't like me.

29:31.395 --> 29:32.419
Okay.

29:32.473 --> 29:34.926
So, you wanted to talk
about the defense?

29:34.981 --> 29:38.122
Yes, I think it needs
to stop being a defense.

29:38.156 --> 29:41.260
You've let them rip into
the non-science of exorcism.

29:41.293 --> 29:45.097
Now you need to rip into
the non-science of psychiatry.

29:45.129 --> 29:48.423
Dr. Lynch-Giles, you
prescribed chlorpromazine

29:48.478 --> 29:51.269
- and aripiprazole for Caroline?
- Yes.

29:51.302 --> 29:52.689
Doctor, where were you

29:52.759 --> 29:55.869
on August 6, 2019?

29:55.939 --> 29:58.369
On vacation.

29:58.432 --> 30:01.549
On a cruise, sponsored by the
same pharmaceutical company

30:01.596 --> 30:03.189
that manufactures chlorpromazine.

30:03.252 --> 30:04.496
Every pharmaceutical company

30:04.529 --> 30:06.415
sponsors events
for the medical industry.

30:06.485 --> 30:08.173
It has absolutely no bearing
on how we treat...

30:08.198 --> 30:13.085
There are seven FDA-approved
first-generation anti-psychotics,

30:13.132 --> 30:15.005
- and ten second-generation...
- Eleven.

30:15.039 --> 30:18.718
...eleven second-generation
anti-psychotics.

30:18.749 --> 30:21.705
So why chlorpromazine
and aripiprazole for Caroline?

30:21.745 --> 30:23.214
Like every psychiatric medication,

30:23.246 --> 30:25.449
prescribing is a bit of an art form.

30:25.483 --> 30:27.595
Doctor, do chlorpromazine
and aripiprazole

30:27.642 --> 30:29.387
- have any side effects?
- They do.

30:29.419 --> 30:31.422
Uh, dizziness, nausea,

30:31.455 --> 30:34.192
- sleepiness, suicidal ideation.
- Dr. Lynch-Giles

30:34.224 --> 30:36.427
stated that Caroline made two attempts

30:36.461 --> 30:38.530
to kill herself after the exorcism.

30:38.562 --> 30:40.809
Were all of these attempts
while she was taking

30:40.864 --> 30:43.334
the medication he prescribed?

30:43.367 --> 30:46.278
- That is correct.
- Are there any anti-psychotics

30:46.303 --> 30:48.406
that don't have suicidal ideation

30:48.438 --> 30:50.507
- as a side effect?
- Clozapine.

30:50.540 --> 30:53.545
So, why wouldn't a psychiatrist
like Dr. Lynch-Giles

30:53.608 --> 30:54.944
prescribe clozapine?

30:56.646 --> 30:58.249
It's expensive.

30:58.281 --> 31:00.140
So, Dr. Lynch-Giles put his patient

31:00.203 --> 31:01.937
on a less-expensive medication

31:01.992 --> 31:04.484
proven to cause people
to kill themselves?

31:04.554 --> 31:06.491
- Objection.
- Dr. Boggs is your witness.

31:06.523 --> 31:09.310
I'm just asking him
questions as an expert.

31:09.365 --> 31:11.396
Doctor, do you have an opinion

31:11.428 --> 31:15.631
on Dr. Lynch-Giles' trauma
conceptualization exercises?

31:15.701 --> 31:18.535
Yes, it is extreme experimental therapy.

31:18.569 --> 31:21.339
Here is an expert that agrees with you

31:21.371 --> 31:24.689
in this article
in <i> The Good Psychologist.</i>

31:24.736 --> 31:25.923
Can you read who wrote it?

31:25.978 --> 31:27.444
Yes.

31:27.477 --> 31:28.806
Dr. Lynch-Giles.

31:28.868 --> 31:32.559
Huh. And what does he write... there?

31:32.600 --> 31:35.503
"This extreme therapeutic method

31:35.537 --> 31:39.049
"can be a guided tour
of their own personal hell

31:39.104 --> 31:40.608
"without a painkiller.

31:40.650 --> 31:42.753
"And if the mental health professional

31:42.778 --> 31:44.114
"doesn't take their time,

31:44.139 --> 31:46.278
the patient will end up
worse than before."

31:46.332 --> 31:47.883
According to his own
words, isn't it possible

31:47.915 --> 31:49.652
that his therapeutic methods

31:49.685 --> 31:52.988
may be just as responsible...
if not more responsible...

31:53.034 --> 31:55.932
for Caroline's
deteriorating mental health?

31:56.011 --> 31:58.447
Yes. Definitely.

31:58.481 --> 31:59.982
Amazing work.

32:00.016 --> 32:02.285
Thanks. Wish I could take full credit.

32:02.317 --> 32:04.754
It was your friend's idea.

32:06.799 --> 32:09.526
So, the problem are just those
pesky psychiatrists?

32:09.558 --> 32:12.494
If only the exorcists
were in complete control...

32:12.528 --> 32:13.997
Sounding a little bitter there,
Ms. Lemonhead.

32:14.029 --> 32:16.298
Let's see how this holds up.

32:16.331 --> 32:17.733
Dr. Bouchard?

32:17.767 --> 32:19.803
- Yes?
- I had no idea

32:19.836 --> 32:22.806
mental health professionals
were such ineffectual quacks.

32:22.838 --> 32:25.375
We'll be re-deposing you tomorrow

32:25.407 --> 32:26.609
based on what you saw.

32:26.643 --> 32:28.711
Although I must confess

32:28.744 --> 32:31.614
- it seems like you keep flipping sides.
- Hmm.

32:31.647 --> 32:33.616
It's hard to know
where your allegiances are.

32:33.650 --> 32:35.585
- My allegiance is to the truth.
- We'll see about that.

32:35.617 --> 32:37.023
See you at 9:00.

32:40.823 --> 32:42.826
What does she know to undercut you?

32:44.953 --> 32:47.115
Everything.

32:54.037 --> 32:55.838
No, no. That's your natural

32:55.872 --> 32:57.740
point of aim. There.

32:57.773 --> 32:59.041
See, now when you lift the gun,

32:59.075 --> 33:00.777
your natural point of aim
aligns with the target.

33:00.791 --> 33:03.291
So fire.

33:03.338 --> 33:04.744
And remember...

33:04.783 --> 33:06.650
Squeeze, don't pull.

33:10.554 --> 33:11.555
Whoo!

33:11.589 --> 33:13.325
Better.

33:13.358 --> 33:14.960
Keep at it.

33:14.991 --> 33:16.527
Have you ever shot anyone?

33:16.560 --> 33:17.795
All the time.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.077
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

33:19.116 --> 33:20.697
That's how you get good at it.

33:20.761 --> 33:21.830
You kill people.

33:32.410 --> 33:34.379
Your graduation!

33:37.082 --> 33:41.676
You are no longer subject to "as if."

33:41.739 --> 33:43.543
Congratulations.

33:44.990 --> 33:46.926
Oh, one last thing.

33:46.958 --> 33:50.041
Fit 4 Women is not working as a target.

33:50.104 --> 33:51.905
What? Why not?

33:51.947 --> 33:53.749
People saw you.

33:53.781 --> 33:56.485
They've already heightened
their security measures.

33:56.518 --> 33:58.653
They'd stop you before you even
turned down the street.

33:58.686 --> 34:02.257
No, we need... a fresh target.

34:02.290 --> 34:05.438
Where people are trusting, vulnerable...

34:05.501 --> 34:07.626
Like, um...

34:08.235 --> 34:09.598
a wedding shop?

34:13.702 --> 34:14.670
No.

34:14.702 --> 34:17.606
Let's see...

34:17.639 --> 34:19.208
Ah.

34:19.239 --> 34:21.110
Prayer group led by this man.

34:21.143 --> 34:23.246
He's a priest-in-training...
without this beard...

34:23.277 --> 34:26.181
and he leads a prayer group
at a nearby church.

34:26.215 --> 34:27.681
But I...

34:27.715 --> 34:29.085
But that's not women.

34:29.117 --> 34:31.786
It's mostly a women's prayer group.

34:31.820 --> 34:34.023
And most importantly,

34:34.056 --> 34:35.623
they are grouped together

34:35.657 --> 34:38.594
and they don't have a security guard.

34:38.626 --> 34:40.295
You could get away.

34:41.829 --> 34:43.766
What?

34:43.797 --> 34:46.601
Oh, I get it.

34:46.635 --> 34:48.367
I'm asking for too much, now?

34:48.420 --> 34:50.123
Okay.

34:50.164 --> 34:52.275
Go home, forget
any of this ever happened.

34:52.306 --> 34:54.585
You go back to your life.

34:54.639 --> 34:55.844
When?

34:59.545 --> 35:01.047
Can I trust you?

35:01.722 --> 35:02.980
Yes.

35:10.726 --> 35:13.663
Then I'll send you a signal.

35:13.695 --> 35:15.730
"S.O.I."

35:15.764 --> 35:17.666
What's that mean?

35:17.699 --> 35:20.235
"Slaughter of the Innocents."

35:20.269 --> 35:22.738
It's cool, right?

35:22.771 --> 35:24.574
Be ready.

35:37.444 --> 35:40.412
How many years have you been
a licensed psychologist, Doctor?

35:40.452 --> 35:41.467
Seven.

35:41.524 --> 35:43.312
But you've recently switched careers?

35:43.350 --> 35:44.866
No, I'm still a psychologist.

35:44.912 --> 35:47.993
I evaluate clients and offer
my professional opinion.

35:48.041 --> 35:49.228
But in a much different context.

35:49.275 --> 35:50.677
No, my role remains the same.

35:50.710 --> 35:51.978
Impartial assessor.

35:52.011 --> 35:53.298
Haven't you chosen religion

35:53.353 --> 35:55.614
- over science in your new role?
- No.

35:55.648 --> 35:57.050
I'm an atheist.

35:57.083 --> 35:59.052
That has nothing to do
with my professional function.

35:59.093 --> 36:02.154
So in your professional opinion,
was Caroline Hopkins possessed?

36:02.201 --> 36:03.779
The DSM-5 doesn't recognize

36:03.818 --> 36:05.435
- possession...
- Yes or no, Doctor?

36:05.482 --> 36:06.393
Let her answer

36:06.425 --> 36:08.295
the question the way she wants.

36:12.031 --> 36:14.400
The DSM-5 is a crucial guide,

36:14.433 --> 36:16.602
but it's also in its fifth edition.

36:16.636 --> 36:19.168
It's about trial and error.

36:19.238 --> 36:23.642
And Dr. Lynch-Giles, in
exercising that trial and error,

36:23.675 --> 36:26.176
contributed to Caroline's ill health.

36:26.216 --> 36:27.848
Excuse me, Doctor, are you telling me...

36:27.903 --> 36:30.007
I'm telling you that
I'm an empiricist, ma'am.

36:30.077 --> 36:33.984
After the exorcism, I saw
a healthy Caroline Hopkins.

36:34.054 --> 36:36.461
She was happy and loving.

36:36.494 --> 36:38.296
Since Dr. Lynch-Giles's care,

36:38.329 --> 36:41.312
I've seen a Caroline who's taken
a turn for the worse.

36:41.359 --> 36:45.436
I think Dr. Lynch-Giles
should stop caring for her.

36:45.468 --> 36:48.338
So you really sold your soul?

36:48.372 --> 36:49.695
Go to hell, Lemonhead.

36:49.757 --> 36:52.087
Ask her a real question
or shut the hell up.

36:52.133 --> 36:53.344
Is this because you're in a relationship

36:53.368 --> 36:54.946
- with David Acosta?
- Oh, my God!

36:54.986 --> 36:56.165
I couldn't help but notice you've gotten

36:56.196 --> 36:57.577
- very familiar with him.
- Are you kidding me?

36:57.602 --> 36:58.508
That's character assassination

36:58.533 --> 37:00.153
- and I don't appreciate it...
- Anything to win a case,

37:00.192 --> 37:01.231
- ...and I will not put up with it.
- is that right?

37:01.286 --> 37:02.737
- I will do anything to stop you from...
- What was it last time...

37:06.641 --> 37:09.271
I'll start by saying
I do not agree with this.

37:11.079 --> 37:14.146
But Caroline Hopkins wants to settle...

37:14.224 --> 37:16.228
for medical costs.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.712
- We can make that work.
- Really?

37:21.782 --> 37:24.220
You think you can make that work?

37:24.290 --> 37:26.895
Well, you gotta love the Church.

37:31.465 --> 37:32.567
Good work, Renee.

37:32.599 --> 37:34.603
Anytime, Your Excellency.

37:49.516 --> 37:50.985
Open it.

37:51.018 --> 37:52.461
Where are the girls?

37:52.523 --> 37:54.281
- I tucked them in.
- And that worked?

37:54.328 --> 37:56.625
Well, I told them if they shut up,

37:56.657 --> 37:57.929
we'd consider keeping the cat.

38:00.862 --> 38:02.497
What is it?

38:02.529 --> 38:04.045
Well, I got everybody else a gift.

38:04.092 --> 38:05.934
I thought I should get you one, too.

38:11.605 --> 38:13.308
- It's light.
- Mm-hmm.

38:14.976 --> 38:17.112
I've been thinking a bit
about your time here,

38:17.145 --> 38:21.382
and, uh, your new job,
and this exorcism thing.

38:21.416 --> 38:25.249
And I realized that you miss it.

38:25.312 --> 38:26.588
Miss what?

38:26.621 --> 38:28.090
Climbing.

38:28.123 --> 38:30.077
And don't say "no."
I mean, you're dealing with

38:30.156 --> 38:34.762
demons and killers,
and people doing bad things.

38:34.795 --> 38:35.963
It's transference, you know?

38:35.996 --> 38:37.318
This is New York.

38:37.343 --> 38:38.645
People doing bad things here

38:38.726 --> 38:41.061
is like climbing a mountain there.

38:41.787 --> 38:42.990
Anyway, open it.

38:46.518 --> 38:48.518
_

38:48.543 --> 38:50.207
You should take the tour
of Everest in the spring.

38:50.277 --> 38:51.894
I'll stay here.

38:51.949 --> 38:53.748
I'll take care of the girls.

38:53.782 --> 38:55.738
I'll be the dad.

38:57.485 --> 38:59.521
You should go. I'll stay.

39:01.088 --> 39:02.924
I just love you.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.093
I'm gonna kill it.

39:28.357 --> 39:29.485
David.

39:51.536 --> 39:53.705
I have to lead a prayer group.

39:57.241 --> 39:59.510
I'm not leaving here until you touch me.

40:29.375 --> 40:32.171
<i>Matrix,</i> baby.

40:32.232 --> 40:35.135
Why-why is this prayer group
only for women?

40:35.187 --> 40:37.857
Are you sure?
'Cause that's not what it says.

40:37.890 --> 40:40.426
You talking to me, lady?

40:47.581 --> 40:49.266
Boom.

40:49.834 --> 40:51.236
Boom.

41:17.609 --> 41:20.843
_

41:20.906 --> 41:23.069
You pathetic, ridiculous...

41:26.257 --> 41:30.408
Pathetic, useless son of a bitch!

41:45.704 --> 41:48.139
_

41:48.891 --> 41:50.576
_

41:55.686 --> 41:57.708
