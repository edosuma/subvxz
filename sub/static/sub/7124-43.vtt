00:09.374 --> 00:10.514
What the...

00:10.616 --> 00:12.460
Why's it so purple outsi...

00:13.273 --> 00:14.539
What?

00:15.281 --> 00:17.765
It's too smoky to see.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.539
Oh! Something's peeking.

00:19.617 --> 00:22.438
Someone's jacking
your spaceship!

00:24.211 --> 00:25.788
That <i>is</i> my ship!

00:25.891 --> 00:27.796
But it looks like
it's been modded out.

00:27.864 --> 00:29.125
That much engine power...

00:29.195 --> 00:30.593
It'll break through
the atmosphere

00:30.661 --> 00:33.156
before I can do anything
to stop it.

00:33.808 --> 00:35.023
Finn and Jake!

00:35.104 --> 00:36.982
Yeah! Get that guy!

00:37.122 --> 00:39.185
- Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
- Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:41.375 --> 00:42.693
- Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
- Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:42.768 --> 00:44.271
Oof!

00:45.921 --> 00:47.263
My Thorn.

00:47.550 --> 00:49.365
I think
we should go inside.

00:50.708 --> 00:52.042
Oof!

01:03.506 --> 01:05.443
Gunther!
What are you doing?!

01:05.568 --> 01:06.891
What <i>am</i> I doing?

01:06.959 --> 01:11.490
A fog shrouds my true intent
even from myself.

01:12.111 --> 01:13.295
There!

01:13.365 --> 01:14.817
The catalyst comet.

01:14.998 --> 01:16.599
It all becomes clear.

01:16.774 --> 01:18.614
I am more than Gunther.

01:18.763 --> 01:22.654
Like a mighty chrysalis
pushing out of a damp cocoon,

01:22.722 --> 01:25.029
I emerge!

01:27.464 --> 01:28.873
Jake! You okay?

01:28.941 --> 01:31.534
Yeah, man.
Just don't croak out here.

01:31.972 --> 01:33.862
Hey, man,
look at Gunther.

01:34.332 --> 01:36.033
Behold!

01:37.909 --> 01:40.198
I am orgalorg!

01:40.494 --> 01:41.987
Whoa.

01:42.858 --> 01:44.292
That's pretty.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.526
Looks good, right?

01:45.757 --> 01:47.136
Hey, where's glob?

01:47.253 --> 01:49.941
I don't know.
Um, he exploded in space.

01:50.009 --> 01:51.175
Yeah, thought so.

01:51.296 --> 01:52.862
Man,
are you still Gunther?

01:52.987 --> 01:54.683
'Cause you seem like
you're <i>not.</i>

01:54.751 --> 01:55.964
I'm orgalorg.

01:56.097 --> 01:58.066
Well, what the heck
are you doing, orgalorg?

01:58.214 --> 02:00.253
It was just
time to come out again.

02:00.351 --> 02:02.052
Glob K.O.-Ing himself,

02:02.135 --> 02:04.261
the arrival
of the catalyst comet,

02:04.362 --> 02:07.472
and a ship to carry me
out of this planet's gravity...

02:07.550 --> 02:11.542
These are doorways
the universe presented to me.

02:11.722 --> 02:14.519
Oh, I know about
open-door philosophy.

02:14.683 --> 02:17.425
What's that? You just
say yes to stuff all the time?

02:17.492 --> 02:18.503
Pretty much.

02:18.649 --> 02:19.683
That seems all right.

02:19.751 --> 02:20.904
It's all yours,

02:20.972 --> 02:22.349
if you're
willing to take it.

02:22.417 --> 02:26.198
Destroy worlds,
crush anyone blocking the door.

02:26.331 --> 02:30.659
Feel their bones crumple
and their goo spill out.

02:30.831 --> 02:32.237
I don't like that
at all.

02:32.362 --> 02:33.663
He made it ugly.

02:33.776 --> 02:35.956
You can't stop me.
I'm orgalorg.

02:36.128 --> 02:37.980
I'm pretty sure
I can take you, bro.

02:38.097 --> 02:41.675
Not after I absorb the power
and knowledge of that comet.

02:41.933 --> 02:44.806
Absorb a triple salchow
to your kneecaps.

02:45.028 --> 02:46.089
Oof!

02:46.335 --> 02:47.834
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

02:48.078 --> 02:50.128
- Grab my hand!
- Okay.

02:50.854 --> 02:51.880
Shoot.

02:51.948 --> 02:53.245
Hey, stop drifting!

02:53.313 --> 02:54.483
I'm not trying to!

02:54.551 --> 02:56.901
Ooh! Maybe I can use
jet propulsion.

02:59.020 --> 03:00.453
Oh, no, I can't breathe.

03:00.521 --> 03:01.683
Jake, no!

03:01.769 --> 03:04.448
Don't worry, man!
I'm working out a plan!

03:04.528 --> 03:06.003
Freaking bing bong!

03:06.105 --> 03:08.261
Jake's gonna fulfill
his croak dream after all.

03:08.347 --> 03:11.206
And that dirty umbrella
is gonna enslave the universe.

03:12.456 --> 03:13.833
Cram... come on.

03:13.901 --> 03:15.438
This is gonna take forever.

03:15.839 --> 03:17.964
Man,
I'm gonna croak out here,

03:18.066 --> 03:20.442
like a fish
in the hands of a child.

03:27.934 --> 03:29.019
Okay, Finn.

03:29.128 --> 03:31.621
Time to make an appeal
to greater forces.

03:31.987 --> 03:37.893
♪ Everything's
falling into place ♪

03:38.487 --> 03:44.854
♪ I'm right where I should be ♪

03:45.541 --> 03:51.721
♪ The tides of life
all led me here ♪

03:52.588 --> 03:58.752
♪ And that's why
I'm not scared ♪

03:59.736 --> 04:05.009
♪ I know the answer will appear, ♪

04:05.077 --> 04:08.415
♪ ple-e-e-ease ♪

04:08.790 --> 04:10.227
Hey, spaceman.

04:10.295 --> 04:11.727
Wha... dad?!

04:11.875 --> 04:14.727
This is so crazy, Finn.

04:14.832 --> 04:16.526
What are you doing
out here?

04:16.594 --> 04:18.906
Floating to my grave!
Hurry up and save me!

04:19.024 --> 04:21.827
Can't, buddy.
This baby does what it wants.

04:21.918 --> 04:23.258
Are you kidding me?!

04:23.406 --> 04:24.766
No, for real.
Look.

04:24.906 --> 04:27.469
Hey.
Get that guy there!

04:27.623 --> 04:30.461
See?
I'm just flying random-style.

04:30.563 --> 04:31.586
It's not random!

04:31.656 --> 04:33.797
I merged my intention
with the universe.

04:33.865 --> 04:34.884
You what?

04:34.952 --> 04:36.914
Oh! Wait.
I have an idea.

04:36.982 --> 04:38.008
Really?

04:38.078 --> 04:39.891
Here... grab on this.

04:40.524 --> 04:42.558
No, it's cool.
You got gloves on.

04:42.626 --> 04:43.959
Oh, yeah.

04:47.367 --> 04:48.401
You all right?

04:48.471 --> 04:49.565
Yeah.

04:49.665 --> 04:51.792
Thanks, dad.
Thanks, universe.

04:51.862 --> 04:52.870
Come again?

04:52.940 --> 04:54.286
Oh! We got to save Jake!

04:54.354 --> 04:55.771
He's out there
choking on gas!

04:55.839 --> 04:58.874
Like I said, I got
no control over this beast.

04:59.010 --> 05:01.028
We're on
a journey into mystery,

05:01.096 --> 05:04.050
unless I figure out
what this bozo responds to.

05:04.221 --> 05:05.575
It's kind of fun, right?

05:05.643 --> 05:09.495
See, there's no reason
or purpose or what you said...

05:09.682 --> 05:11.815
Uh, universal intention.

05:11.889 --> 05:13.155
Look around, Finn.

05:13.315 --> 05:16.003
Empty crud.
So empty.

05:16.214 --> 05:18.089
I don't know.
There's some stars and stuff.

05:18.214 --> 05:21.346
You're squeezed so tight,
your bottom's gonna fall out.

05:21.465 --> 05:23.232
Put the phone down.

05:23.300 --> 05:24.979
- "Put the phone down"?
- Yeah...

05:25.102 --> 05:26.190
Whoa!

05:26.258 --> 05:27.651
What's going on, huh?

05:27.742 --> 05:29.430
Look!
The light of the comet.

05:29.573 --> 05:30.854
Ahh.

05:31.245 --> 05:32.653
That's pretty neat.

05:32.721 --> 05:34.979
This moth
is so bananas, man.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.651
"Bananas, man."

05:36.719 --> 05:38.354
"Bananas, man."

05:38.443 --> 05:40.120
Uh-oh. What's that?

05:40.580 --> 05:42.604
Almost there.

05:42.807 --> 05:44.953
That dude's gonna absorb
the comet's mystical power

05:45.021 --> 05:46.112
and crush everybody.

05:46.181 --> 05:47.878
Who the heck
raises guys like that?

05:48.042 --> 05:50.052
You think he had
neglectful parents, like you?

05:50.120 --> 05:52.495
Or would he have <i>always</i> been
a no-good orgalorg?

05:52.612 --> 05:55.163
Oh, gob slops!
Not orgalorg!

05:55.292 --> 05:56.378
You... you...
You know him?

05:56.446 --> 05:57.528
Yeah!

05:57.596 --> 05:59.268
What do you think...
I'm a dumb brick?

05:59.336 --> 06:00.737
I don't know orgalorg?

06:00.871 --> 06:03.425
Oh, yeah.

06:03.894 --> 06:06.300
Snaps!
He ate the comet!

06:07.210 --> 06:08.216
I got to stop him.

06:08.284 --> 06:10.565
It's too late, buddy.
It's out of our hands.

06:10.633 --> 06:11.784
Skronk that!

06:11.878 --> 06:15.068
I'm gonna use these hands
to sock him in the chops!

06:15.181 --> 06:17.279
In the chops!

06:26.596 --> 06:28.005
Hey! Dinglord!

06:28.073 --> 06:29.206
In the name of...

06:29.274 --> 06:32.052
The universe,
stop that!

06:32.768 --> 06:38.029
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

06:41.956 --> 06:43.576
Grass sword.

06:45.108 --> 06:46.396
Raaa!

06:49.380 --> 06:50.544
Huh?

06:51.367 --> 06:53.427
Yah-ta-ta-ta-ta!

06:58.327 --> 06:59.653
Whoa.

06:59.897 --> 07:02.872
I didn't open <i>this</i> door.

07:04.875 --> 07:06.142
Cool.

07:11.982 --> 07:14.646
Finn,
do you remember?

07:14.841 --> 07:16.441
Oh.

07:16.647 --> 07:18.067
Yeah, I-I think so.

07:18.153 --> 07:21.021
A long time ago,
I was you, sort of.

07:21.419 --> 07:25.192
And I crashed on earth and
became a butterfly or some biz.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.231
And I guess it was
just some random absurd thing,

07:28.356 --> 07:30.591
just a joke I've been
playing out for centuries.

07:30.695 --> 07:32.161
Who's creating the joke?

07:32.263 --> 07:33.281
Are <i>you?</i>

07:33.349 --> 07:36.560
And if so,
then are you <i>my</i> creator?

07:36.628 --> 07:38.528
Uh, maybe.
I don't know.

07:38.596 --> 07:39.638
Probably not.

07:39.708 --> 07:41.450
Probably not,
but who knows?

07:41.591 --> 07:43.099
I've been around forever

07:43.197 --> 07:45.708
and experienced
so much impossible junk.

07:45.825 --> 07:49.231
I've embodied
all that is good and evil.

07:49.454 --> 07:50.820
And now we're here.

07:50.924 --> 07:52.231
It's unprecedented.

07:52.497 --> 07:54.036
And I give you
a choice...

07:54.224 --> 07:57.070
Come with me
to the end and the beginning

07:57.138 --> 08:00.677
or struggle here awhile
like a beautiful autumn leaf.

08:00.942 --> 08:02.716
What's that bell sound?

08:03.778 --> 08:05.312
Cool, man.

08:05.380 --> 08:06.763
This is your crisis.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.966
As you stand
on the edge of freedom

08:09.034 --> 08:11.560
from love...

08:11.868 --> 08:13.168
Hate...

08:13.411 --> 08:14.755
Friendship...

08:14.838 --> 08:16.338
Isolation...

08:16.474 --> 08:17.778
Jealousy...

08:17.974 --> 08:19.308
Secrets...

08:19.536 --> 08:20.794
Violence...

08:21.009 --> 08:22.375
Video games...

08:22.661 --> 08:24.279
Ice-cream waffles...

08:24.347 --> 08:25.786
Sadness...

08:25.883 --> 08:27.333
Madness...

08:27.424 --> 08:28.790
Power...

08:28.933 --> 08:30.199
Honor...

08:30.287 --> 08:31.669
Loyalty...

08:31.820 --> 08:33.119
Saucy...

08:33.222 --> 08:34.621
Mothers...

08:34.791 --> 08:36.035
Fathers...

08:36.150 --> 08:37.386
Scoundrels.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.200
How long
are you gonna list stuff?

08:39.307 --> 08:40.864
It's a long list.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.097
You're telling me
to abandon all this stuff,

08:43.263 --> 08:45.692
but you're not really
making it sound bad.

08:45.819 --> 08:46.989
It's <i>not</i> bad.

08:47.070 --> 08:50.614
I'm just giving you the choice
of a new mode of existence.

08:51.606 --> 08:54.192
I feel like I put a lot of work
into this meat reality.

08:54.286 --> 08:55.661
I'd like
to see it through.

08:55.731 --> 08:56.913
Fair enough.

08:56.981 --> 08:59.381
Hey, how about
<i>I</i> get a new mode?

09:00.303 --> 09:02.717
Are you seriously trying
to bail out <i>again?!</i>

09:02.975 --> 09:05.881
What?
This deal sounds pretty good.

09:06.381 --> 09:07.545
Dad.

09:07.663 --> 09:09.381
Uh-oh.
I know that look.

09:09.493 --> 09:10.556
When you fled the scene

09:10.624 --> 09:12.194
like a ding-dong-ditcher
in the night...

09:12.262 --> 09:13.407
Listen, Finn.

09:13.475 --> 09:16.124
No answer I give you
will be satisfying.

09:16.217 --> 09:18.647
Besides,
it was like 40 years ago.

09:18.715 --> 09:19.899
I'm 16!

09:19.967 --> 09:22.874
I don't have a star
to revolve around to track time.

09:22.944 --> 09:24.858
Well, why do you
always run from everything?

09:24.926 --> 09:26.462
You burn enough Bridges,

09:26.530 --> 09:28.522
the only direction to move
is forward.

09:28.737 --> 09:29.850
Hm.

09:29.975 --> 09:31.913
Well, there ain't
no changing you, I guess.

09:31.999 --> 09:34.592
Well, I'm glad we finally
understand each other.

09:34.695 --> 09:37.149
Start the engine,
comet boy!

09:37.217 --> 09:39.006
Prepare
to discorporate.

09:39.139 --> 09:41.084
Goodbye, son!

09:41.249 --> 09:42.670
Bye, dad.

09:43.108 --> 09:44.631
I should have asked
for a lift home.

09:44.713 --> 09:46.327
Unh!

09:46.912 --> 09:48.229
Jake!

09:48.297 --> 09:49.530
I thought I had lost...

09:49.598 --> 09:50.764
You.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.791
Noooooo!

09:52.906 --> 09:55.340
- You okay, Finn?
- What?!

09:56.541 --> 09:58.397
Jake! Banana man?!

09:58.465 --> 09:59.516
How?

09:59.584 --> 10:00.975
I was just
floating around,

10:01.043 --> 10:03.319
and I drifted
into B-man's flight path.

10:03.425 --> 10:04.818
Pretty random, right?

10:04.975 --> 10:07.147
It-It-It wasn't random.
<i>I</i> did it.

10:07.350 --> 10:09.647
Let's get
the jazz out of here.

10:10.419 --> 10:12.587
Nooooo!

10:21.031 --> 10:22.530
There we go. See?

10:22.636 --> 10:24.702
Problem
took care of itself.

10:24.834 --> 10:26.897
You think Finn and Jake
are all right?

10:27.022 --> 10:29.373
I'd say
it's about a 50/50 chance.

10:29.522 --> 10:31.952
That's pretty much
everything in life, isn't it?

10:32.020 --> 10:33.368
Yeah. Whoa!

10:33.436 --> 10:35.061
What's that?!

10:41.438 --> 10:44.014
Hey, PB.
We took care of it.

10:44.328 --> 10:45.740
Good job, guys.

10:45.850 --> 10:48.428
Mm, I'm gonna croak
out here.
