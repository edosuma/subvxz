WEBVTT

00:00.707 --> 00:01.807
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:01.808 --> 00:03.342
welcome to the most
anticipated event

00:03.343 --> 00:05.710
in this precinct's history.

00:05.745 --> 00:09.314
The auction for...

00:09.349 --> 00:10.916
The Suitcase of Mystery!

00:10.917 --> 00:12.417
Exactly, Jacob.

00:12.452 --> 00:16.989
This puppy's been in the lost
and found since 1976.

00:16.990 --> 00:19.859
No one alive today
knows its contents.

00:19.860 --> 00:21.360
I'm happy to say Captain Holt

00:21.361 --> 00:24.063
has finally given me permission
to auction it off.

00:24.064 --> 00:25.364
I'll let you give me
a spray tan.

00:25.365 --> 00:26.499
Any shade you want.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.700
Jake, willing to sacrifice
his dignity.

00:28.735 --> 00:30.035
- Who can top it?
- Massage!

00:30.036 --> 00:31.170
I'll give you a massage.

00:31.171 --> 00:33.038
Charles,
going in the wrong direction

00:33.039 --> 00:34.673
and getting himself
disqualified.

00:34.674 --> 00:35.875
Interesting approach.

00:35.876 --> 00:38.943
"Orange Jake",
going once, going twice.

00:38.979 --> 00:40.746
I'll show you a picture of me
in high school.

00:40.747 --> 00:43.249
- There is side-pony.
- Ooh, Rosa coming in hot!

00:43.250 --> 00:44.850
- Rosa coming in hot!
- I'll also give you

00:44.851 --> 00:46.619
full control of my hair
and wardrobe!

00:46.620 --> 00:47.620
I'll go on a date with you.

00:47.621 --> 00:48.888
Sold!

00:48.889 --> 00:49.889
To Jake, not to Scully.

00:49.890 --> 00:50.956
That really freaked me out,

00:50.957 --> 00:51.991
and I just want this to end now.

00:51.992 --> 00:52.991
Whoo!

So, there was this suitcase...

01:03.370 --> 01:04.631
- I don't care.
- Yeah.

01:24.391 --> 01:26.457
All right, everyone,
enough morning chitchat.

01:26.493 --> 01:28.561
Television happened,
commutes were difficult,

01:28.562 --> 01:29.828
Boyle had a dream.

01:29.829 --> 01:31.830
- I laid a goose egg on this...
- That's enough.

01:31.831 --> 01:33.532
A pipe burst
in the nine-eight,

01:33.533 --> 01:35.267
rendering the building
uninhabitable.

01:35.268 --> 01:37.602
They'll be sharing our space
until the problem is fixed.

01:37.637 --> 01:39.037
Oh, what?

01:39.072 --> 01:40.773
A whole other precinct in here?

01:40.774 --> 01:42.575
We're already packed in
like sardines.

01:42.576 --> 01:43.876
Look at this.

01:43.877 --> 01:46.045
Man, I sure will love
to be here to greet

01:46.046 --> 01:48.247
all these annoying losers,
but sadly,

01:48.248 --> 01:50.649
Boyle and I are going to be
on a stakeout all week.

01:50.650 --> 01:53.452
Yeah, just two best buds
stinking up a Saturn

01:53.453 --> 01:56.455
with our druthers of tunes
and personal pan pizzas.

01:56.456 --> 01:59.023
- That sucks.
- That sucks.

01:59.059 --> 02:00.359
No one enjoyed that.

02:00.360 --> 02:01.994
Look, I know this is
an inconvenience;

02:01.995 --> 02:04.697
however, I expect you all to be
accommodating to our guests.

02:04.698 --> 02:08.666
Don't worry, sir,
we will be cordial A. F.

02:09.869 --> 02:11.537
"As Frasier."
Love that show.

02:11.538 --> 02:12.938
They're here.

02:12.939 --> 02:14.840
I hate those
nine-eight losers.

02:14.841 --> 02:17.776
Ugh.
These guys are the worst.

02:17.777 --> 02:20.244
Hey, Stevie Schillens?

02:20.280 --> 02:22.247
Jakey P in the place to be.

02:22.248 --> 02:23.349
What are you doing here?

02:23.350 --> 02:24.617
I thought you were
in the one-two-four.

02:24.618 --> 02:26.885
I was, man, but then
I arrested all the bad guys

02:26.886 --> 02:28.893
in Staten, so I transferred
to the nine-eight.

02:28.922 --> 02:30.122
So dope.

02:30.123 --> 02:32.458
Everyone, put on your parkas,
'cause this week

02:32.459 --> 02:35.327
just got a whole a lot more
chill.

02:35.328 --> 02:38.097
Both: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

02:38.098 --> 02:41.200
Allow me to introduce
Stevie "Chillin'" Schillens.

02:41.201 --> 02:43.569
He was my very first partner
and one of the all-time greats.

02:43.570 --> 02:44.770
Takes one to know one, man.

02:44.771 --> 02:45.837
Come on.

02:45.872 --> 02:47.072
I'm Charles!

02:47.073 --> 02:48.240
Wuh-oh.

02:48.241 --> 02:49.408
Hey, what's up, man?
I'm Stevie.

02:49.409 --> 02:50.409
We heard.

02:50.410 --> 02:51.944
Stevie and I
were beat cops together.

02:51.945 --> 02:53.879
We called ourselves
the Beatsie Boys.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.087
And, yeah, it was as cool
as it sounds.

02:56.116 --> 02:57.549

So, y'all would just stand

03:02.956 --> 03:03.956
- Yeah!
- All the time.

03:03.957 --> 03:04.990
Totally get it.

03:04.991 --> 03:06.425
My first partner
was also pretty cool.

03:06.426 --> 03:08.927
Everyone called us
"Chucky and the Coot."

03:08.928 --> 03:10.362

03:14.467 --> 03:16.669
So, I guess we all had
great partners

03:16.670 --> 03:18.170
that we've completely
moved on from.

03:18.171 --> 03:19.237
Because yours died of old age?

03:19.272 --> 03:20.539
He did.

03:20.540 --> 03:21.940
Anyway, we should motor.

03:21.941 --> 03:25.010
Jake and I are staking out a bar
called the Thirsty Ox...

03:25.011 --> 03:27.212
lot of crime, lot of danger,

03:27.213 --> 03:29.214
lot of downtime
for inside jokes.

03:29.215 --> 03:31.016
[weird voice]
"Would you like some milk?"

03:31.017 --> 03:32.116
- [laughing]
- What?

03:32.152 --> 03:33.418
[weird voice]
"Would you like some milk?"

03:33.453 --> 03:34.787
- The guy...'cause you look like...
- I don't know

03:34.788 --> 03:36.255
- what you're talking about.
- "Would like the milk?"

03:36.256 --> 03:37.356
- Please.
- What is it from?

03:37.357 --> 03:38.457
He's funny.
He remembers. Funny.

03:38.458 --> 03:39.725
- Very funny.
- You know what's crazy?

03:39.726 --> 03:41.126
I've been tracking a dealer

03:41.127 --> 03:42.795
who just took a job
at the Thirsty Ox.

03:42.796 --> 03:44.496
No crap.

03:44.497 --> 03:45.864
We should work the case
together.

03:45.865 --> 03:47.599
The Beatsie Boys
reunion tour?

03:47.600 --> 03:49.735
Tagline: Boys Will
Always Be Boys.

03:49.736 --> 03:51.637
No wait.
"Some Boys Never Change."

03:51.638 --> 03:53.806
No wait.
"Boys to Man back to Boys."

03:53.807 --> 03:55.908
No wait.
"Boy-ees!"

03:55.909 --> 03:56.841
No wait.

03:56.876 --> 03:58.176
Please, make yourself at home.

04:00.146 --> 04:01.680
Captain,
why are you doing this?

04:01.681 --> 04:03.147
You hate people in your space.

04:03.183 --> 04:05.751
Nonsense.
I'm an easygoing chap.

04:05.752 --> 04:09.420
Okay. I once saw you use a
ruler to measure another ruler.

04:09.456 --> 04:10.823
It was off
by half a centimeter.

04:10.824 --> 04:12.224
It never should've been
in circulation.

04:12.225 --> 04:13.892
Now, if you'll excuse me.

04:13.893 --> 04:15.494
Oh, he just sat at your desk.

04:15.495 --> 04:17.129
[sighs]
Good.

04:17.130 --> 04:18.596
Good.
I was hoping he would.

04:18.598 --> 04:20.432
He's adjusting
your chair settings.

04:20.433 --> 04:21.432
Even the lumbar?

04:21.434 --> 04:24.470
Exclusively the lumbar.

04:24.471 --> 04:26.905
So my spine'll hurt a little.

04:26.906 --> 04:31.176
It's only a highway holding
all your body's nerves.

04:31.177 --> 04:32.444
Mm-hmm.

04:32.445 --> 04:34.313
You guys have an extra mouse
for my computer?

04:34.314 --> 04:36.614
No.
But, hey,

04:36.649 --> 04:38.117
here, you can borrow mine.

04:38.118 --> 04:40.486
Terry knows
his keyboard shortcuts!

04:40.487 --> 04:43.422
Whoop. Just deleted everything.

04:43.423 --> 04:46.258
- Sir, we have a problem.
- Yeah, we do.

04:46.259 --> 04:48.327
The line for the microwave
is insane!

04:48.328 --> 04:49.795
Seriously, Amy?

04:49.796 --> 04:52.364
Your problem is Hitchcock
and Scully's frozen burritos?

04:52.365 --> 04:53.499
No!
Both: Yeah!

04:53.500 --> 04:54.700
Get our of here!

04:54.701 --> 04:57.402
Ugh! I'm trying to assemble
my binders,

04:57.403 --> 05:00.139
but my new desk mate, Brian,
brought a dog with him

05:00.140 --> 05:02.140
and my allergies
are going crazy.

05:02.175 --> 05:05.009
I'm so stuffy, I can't even
enjoy that new binder smell.

05:05.044 --> 05:06.812
He shouldn't have a pet
in the precinct.

05:06.813 --> 05:10.481
It's a "service animal"
that he has made-up reasons.

05:10.517 --> 05:13.618
I have mild foot pain, okay?
Francie helps me with that.

05:13.653 --> 05:15.521
- How?
- Legally, you're not allow

05:15.522 --> 05:17.022
- to ask me that.
- Ugh.

05:17.023 --> 05:18.724
That is nothing.

05:18.725 --> 05:21.026
My new desk mate...

05:21.027 --> 05:22.361
chats.

05:22.362 --> 05:24.363
Now, I like to think
of this little lady

05:24.364 --> 05:26.765
as a city girl who married
a farmhand.

05:26.766 --> 05:27.933
[giggles]

05:27.934 --> 05:30.035
She also likes to
look up recipes online

05:30.036 --> 05:32.037
and go,
"Who's got the time?"

05:32.038 --> 05:33.071
Okay.

05:33.072 --> 05:35.371
Captain wants things
running smoothly,

05:35.375 --> 05:38.310
so why don't you both just move
and work from my desk?

05:38.311 --> 05:39.411
- Fine.
- See?

05:39.412 --> 05:43.282
Everything is gonna be fine.

05:43.283 --> 05:46.417
Whoop, guy just took
my whole computer.

05:47.654 --> 05:49.620
The dealer I'm looking for
is Tom Ozerov.

05:49.656 --> 05:51.924
Arrested him a year ago
on a first-degree felony,

05:51.925 --> 05:53.257
but he made a deal and walked.

05:53.293 --> 05:54.493
Dude's a real lowlife.

05:54.494 --> 05:55.761
Yeah, we've seen that guy.

05:55.762 --> 05:57.830
I said he looked like a lowlife,
remember that, Jake?

05:57.831 --> 05:59.364
- His pants were too tight.
- Ah, yeah.

05:59.365 --> 06:00.866
Hey, you know what else
is too tight?

06:00.867 --> 06:02.401
Us working a case together
again.

06:02.402 --> 06:04.484
[both laughing]

06:04.504 --> 06:06.237
- Swurt.
- Whoo!

06:06.272 --> 06:08.206
Yeah, we say "noice,"
not "swurt."

06:08.241 --> 06:10.175
Look, I'm so sorry,
but I don't think there's room

06:10.176 --> 06:11.510
for a third person on this case.

06:11.511 --> 06:13.011
Jake, we should work it solo.

06:13.012 --> 06:14.847
Whoa, hang on that, Boyle.
Let's not be hasty.

06:14.848 --> 06:16.849
I mean, Stevie's been tracking
Ozerov longer than we have.

06:16.850 --> 06:18.049
And three heads are better
than two.

06:18.084 --> 06:19.718
Three's a crowd.
Everybody knows that.

06:19.719 --> 06:21.119
What about in "The Lion King,"
huh?

06:21.120 --> 06:23.221
When Jamone and Purboy became
friends with Steemba.

06:23.256 --> 06:24.289
That's not the names.

06:24.290 --> 06:25.490
It's Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa,

06:25.491 --> 06:26.859
but I appreciate you trying.

06:26.860 --> 06:28.426
Really is a perfect analogy.

06:28.461 --> 06:30.295
All right, I'm in.

06:30.296 --> 06:31.529
Stevie can work the case.

06:31.564 --> 06:32.564
Oh, right!

06:53.019 --> 06:54.185
It was a good rhyme, though.

06:56.908 --> 06:58.375
Hey.
Hey, buddy.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.411
Look, I'm not gonna waste
your time

07:00.412 --> 07:01.745
with some lame excuse

07:01.746 --> 07:03.314
about why we left you behind,
all right?

07:03.315 --> 07:04.948
Just the truth.

07:04.949 --> 07:08.184
Stevie and I were taken hostage
by an Armenian biker gang

07:08.219 --> 07:09.987
and thrown on a cargo ship
head it to Asia,

07:09.988 --> 07:11.088
but we're back now.

07:11.089 --> 07:12.121
Don't worry about it.

07:12.157 --> 07:13.590
You can work the case
without me.

07:13.591 --> 07:16.726
I'm busy bonding
with my new desk mate, Paul.

07:16.761 --> 07:17.928
Hi, my name's Paul.

07:17.929 --> 07:19.630
Shh, Paul, nobody cares.

07:19.631 --> 07:21.065
Charles, I'm so sorry.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.066
Don't be mad, okay?

07:22.067 --> 07:23.466
We need you to
work this case with us.

07:23.501 --> 07:24.768
And you're way to good for Paul.

07:24.769 --> 07:26.136
Stop trying to flatter me.

07:26.137 --> 07:28.205
Jake, face it,
I'm not a Beatsie Boy.

07:28.206 --> 07:29.907
All right.
Well, then neither am I.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.607
The Beatsie Boys are finished.

07:31.643 --> 07:33.444
If you're gonna be part of
the group, we need a new name,

07:33.445 --> 07:34.778
a new name that you're gonna
came up with.

07:34.779 --> 07:36.680
- Police Pals.
- Okay, it's decent.

07:36.681 --> 07:37.815
You can come up
with a couple options.

07:37.816 --> 07:39.149
Not necessary.
That's the one.

07:39.150 --> 07:40.184
Okeydokey, let's go.

07:40.185 --> 07:42.386
So, Gina, how's it going?

07:42.387 --> 07:43.387
What's the gossip?

07:43.388 --> 07:44.667
"What's the gossip?"

07:44.689 --> 07:47.633
You can't stand being in
your office with him, can you?

07:47.634 --> 07:49.335
No, I'm just curious
about your life.

07:49.336 --> 07:50.403
I like to gab.

07:50.404 --> 07:54.240
So, uh, tell me about...

07:54.241 --> 07:55.408
boys.

07:55.409 --> 07:57.343
Okay.
I hate this.

07:57.344 --> 08:00.345
Captain, you gotta stand up
to that office hog.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.048
Be stern, like me.

08:02.049 --> 08:05.151
Notice I'm not sharing a desk
with Flynt's assistant.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.052
'Cause he over... there.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.689
No eye contact.
Get back to work.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.290
Ugh! Listen.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.959
You just say the word,

08:12.960 --> 08:16.229
and I will barge in there
and kick that dude out.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.197
Don't be ridiculous.
He is my superior officer.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.966
But more to the point,
he's a welcome guest,

08:19.967 --> 08:21.199
and I am a good host.

08:21.235 --> 08:23.302
He locked you out
of your own office, didn't he?

08:23.303 --> 08:24.403
Yes, very much so.

08:24.404 --> 08:25.937
Oh, Raymond.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.608
Why do we all got to
sit in the back?

08:28.609 --> 08:31.077
Because we are all here
together and we are all equals.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.179
Yeah.
Hey, I've got an idea.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.214
Why don't we listen
some sweet stakeout jams?

08:35.215 --> 08:37.750
Ooh, do you have the satellite
radio station "Sedan Rock"?

08:37.751 --> 08:38.751
Seriously?

08:38.751 --> 08:39.885
Why not just go straight

08:39.886 --> 08:41.182
for the Toni Braxton
while you're at it?

08:41.188 --> 08:43.155
Oh, now you're gonna
make fun of Toni?

08:43.157 --> 08:44.222
Who is this joker?

08:44.224 --> 08:46.259
Check it out.
Guy entering.

08:46.260 --> 08:47.326
Wait, I know that dude.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.795
He buys from Ozerov.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.229
I mean, something's going down.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.565
I say we gear up,
and we bust in.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.599
Like we did
at Pacala Ristorante, remember?

08:54.635 --> 08:58.437
<i>[dramatic rock music]</i>

08:58.438 --> 09:00.005
That's how we do it
in Brooklyn.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.507
Yeah, okay,
it sounds pretty cool,

09:01.508 --> 09:03.676
but Jake and I already talked
how we'd play this.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.645
We had a pretty sweet convo
about it.

09:05.646 --> 09:06.646
Remember?

09:06.647 --> 09:08.047
I think we should
do surveillance,

09:08.048 --> 09:09.482
collect intel,
and build a case.

09:09.483 --> 09:10.783
Sure.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.119
So, we all got stories, pal.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.254
Look.
We need information.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.757
If we bust in there and Ozerov
doesn't have any drugs,

09:17.758 --> 09:19.191
our whole operation is blown.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.693
But I know this guy,
all right?

09:20.694 --> 09:22.328
He never works out of one place
for long.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.163
I guarantee you
he has drugs on him

09:24.164 --> 09:25.997
and if we don't get him now,
we never will.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.734
Well, too bad for you,
because Jake agrees with me.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.774
We're always on the same...

09:31.775 --> 09:33.484
- Page?
- Yes! Told you.

09:33.510 --> 09:35.843
Actually, Charles,
I think Stevie's right.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.179
No.
You said "page."

09:37.180 --> 09:39.848
I know, but he knows
this case, and I trust his gut.

09:39.849 --> 09:43.152
But, hey, let's go catch
a bad guy together, right?

09:43.153 --> 09:44.920
Gear up, Police Pals!

09:44.921 --> 09:46.220
Hey, what is that?

09:46.256 --> 09:47.623
Thought we were Beatsie Boys.

09:47.624 --> 09:49.525
You didn't even tell him.

09:49.526 --> 09:50.626
<i>[muffled heavy rock music]</i>

09:50.627 --> 09:52.361
Rosa, do you need to listen
to it that loud?

09:52.362 --> 09:54.296
Yes!

09:54.297 --> 09:56.098
I'm trying to drown out
the sound from Ellen,

09:56.099 --> 09:57.633
the chat factory, over there.

09:57.634 --> 10:00.336
My daughter got me a juicer
for Christmas.

10:00.337 --> 10:02.071
Did you know
that you can juice nuts?

10:02.072 --> 10:03.305
What?

10:03.306 --> 10:05.239
I'm two seconds away
from juicing Ellen.

10:05.275 --> 10:06.934
I know it's tough,
but Sarge...

10:06.943 --> 10:08.877
Ah, no, shoo, shoo, shoo.

10:08.878 --> 10:10.312
Shoo! Shoo!

10:10.313 --> 10:12.381
Oh, can you at least
put her on a leash?

10:12.382 --> 10:14.416
She's a medical professional.
Okay?

10:14.417 --> 10:15.985
Would you keep a doctor
on a leash?

10:15.986 --> 10:17.886
That dog does not help you
with your foot pain.

10:17.887 --> 10:19.888
You just want an excuse
to bring her everywhere!

10:19.889 --> 10:21.223
Your dog is a fraud.

10:21.224 --> 10:22.391
- Fraud dog!
- Come on.

10:22.392 --> 10:24.560
Fraud dog!
Fraud dog!

10:24.561 --> 10:25.561
- Fraud dog!
- Juice Ellen!

10:25.562 --> 10:26.562
- Juice Ellen!
- Fraud dog!

10:26.563 --> 10:27.563
Whoa!

10:27.564 --> 10:30.332
Both of you, outside now!

10:30.333 --> 10:31.834
I know it's crowded in there

10:31.835 --> 10:34.402
and they're not
very considerate guests

10:34.437 --> 10:36.105
and they took my mouse

10:36.106 --> 10:37.806
and then they took my keyboard

10:37.807 --> 10:39.441
and then they took
the whole computer.

10:39.442 --> 10:42.211
And when I had
nothing else to give,

10:42.212 --> 10:43.779
they came for my yogurt.

10:43.780 --> 10:45.647
No, not just any yogurt.

10:45.648 --> 10:49.317
Full fat Greek
with a touch of honey.

10:50.987 --> 10:52.554
That's a once a week treat!

10:52.555 --> 10:54.990
[microwave beeping]

10:54.991 --> 10:56.725
What the hell are you guys
doing out here?

10:56.726 --> 10:58.027
Finally eating breakfast.

10:58.028 --> 10:59.728
We snuck
the microwave out here

10:59.729 --> 11:02.164
so we could cook our burritos
like real policemen.

11:02.165 --> 11:03.866
Now they have to use
the toaster oven.

11:03.867 --> 11:06.635
Enjoy your 16-minute cook times,
idiots.

11:06.636 --> 11:09.004
Guys, this is amazing.

11:09.005 --> 11:11.273
Back off, it's our microwave!
Ours!

11:11.274 --> 11:12.708
[growls]

11:12.709 --> 11:14.777
Nobody wants your microwave!

11:14.778 --> 11:17.913
But look, the nine-eight's stuff
is blocking the windows.

11:17.914 --> 11:19.848
They can't see us out here.

11:19.849 --> 11:21.383
It's so peaceful...

11:21.384 --> 11:23.552
and spacious.

11:23.553 --> 11:26.921
This could be our new beginning.

11:29.025 --> 11:30.259
All right.

11:30.260 --> 11:31.760
Can't let Ozerov
ditch the drugs.

11:31.761 --> 11:33.462
We got to go in
fast and strong.

11:33.463 --> 11:35.531
I don't know about you,
but I can use some adrenalin.

11:35.532 --> 11:36.632
A little slap-slap-boom?

11:36.633 --> 11:38.233
- Mm.
- What's slap-slap-boom?

11:38.234 --> 11:39.501
Oh, it's just this thing
we used to do

11:39.502 --> 11:41.503
to get each other pumped up
where we slap each other

11:41.504 --> 11:43.205
in the face;
you don't have to do it.

11:43.206 --> 11:44.640
No, I want to.
I want to go first.

11:44.641 --> 11:45.641
[slaps]
Ow!

11:45.642 --> 11:46.942
[slaps]
Ooh! Ooh!

11:46.943 --> 11:48.477
Shh.
There's movement.

11:48.478 --> 11:50.379
But I'm the only one
who got slapped in the face.

11:50.380 --> 11:52.714
Charles, we gotta go!

11:52.715 --> 11:55.317
NYPD!
Show me your hands!

11:55.318 --> 11:58.821
Hey, Ozerov, I'll have
a martini with a twist.

11:58.822 --> 12:01.156
The twist?
You're under arrest.

12:01.157 --> 12:02.758
None for me;
I'm driving...

12:02.759 --> 12:04.193
you to jail.

12:04.194 --> 12:05.960
He's clean.
There's no drugs on him.

12:05.995 --> 12:07.096
Damn it.

12:07.097 --> 12:09.231
We wasted those
cool lines on nothing.

12:09.232 --> 12:10.399
Also, we blew the case.

12:10.400 --> 12:11.567
That's obviously much worse.

12:11.568 --> 12:12.608
That was my first thought.

12:14.717 --> 12:17.074
Look, I know that
we didn't find any drugs,

12:17.075 --> 12:18.642
but I still think
it was worth the risk.

12:18.643 --> 12:21.078
Well, I think it was
a crap circus.

12:21.079 --> 12:23.179
This whole operation
is blown.

12:23.215 --> 12:25.282
If you ask me,
the Beatsie Boys

12:25.283 --> 12:26.317
should be called

12:26.318 --> 12:28.785
the Thoroughly
Messed-Up Millies.

12:28.820 --> 12:30.521
- What?
- I can't even imagine

12:30.522 --> 12:31.522
what you're going for.

12:31.523 --> 12:33.057
I was being devastating!

12:33.058 --> 12:34.758
Look, man,
I get that you're pissed,

12:34.759 --> 12:36.594
but I am telling you,
Ozerov is dirty.

12:36.595 --> 12:38.262
Maybe, but if we had staked
the bar out,

12:38.263 --> 12:40.497
we could've built up cases
against a dozen guys here.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.132
This place is filled
with criminals.

12:42.133 --> 12:43.566
I brought him in last month.

12:43.602 --> 12:45.436
- Hey, Detective Boyle.
- Hi, Isaac.

12:45.437 --> 12:47.638
The only good thing is,
now this whole trio

12:47.639 --> 12:49.206
doesn't have to
work together anymore.

12:49.207 --> 12:51.041
Yes it does.
Charles, you did it.

12:51.042 --> 12:53.244
- You saved the case.
- What? Why? I didn't want to.

12:53.245 --> 12:55.546
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but consorting with known felons

12:55.547 --> 12:57.014
is a parole violation,
meaning

12:57.015 --> 12:59.450
we have grounds to search
Ozerov's home.

12:59.451 --> 13:02.620
Hell yeah!
Jakey P with the save!

13:02.621 --> 13:04.255
Well, you know, Boyle
is the one who pointed it out.

13:04.256 --> 13:05.990
- He deserves the credit.
- True, true, true.

13:05.991 --> 13:06.991
Good job, Earl!

13:06.992 --> 13:08.524
You know my name is Charles.

13:10.862 --> 13:13.963
So, if we're gonna start
a secret office on the roof,

13:13.999 --> 13:15.165
we need equipment.

13:15.166 --> 13:18.135
That means chairs, desks,
printers, pens.

13:18.136 --> 13:19.336
But we gotta sneak it out,

13:19.337 --> 13:20.870
so we need a distraction.

13:20.906 --> 13:22.406
Okay, here is
what I'm thinking.

13:22.407 --> 13:24.475
We give that dog
a bunch of chocolates.

13:24.476 --> 13:25.475
It dies.

13:25.477 --> 13:26.644
While everyone celebrates...

13:26.645 --> 13:28.012
Okay, Amy's
too close to this.

13:28.013 --> 13:29.914
Rosa, you got any ideas?

13:29.915 --> 13:32.116
Hitchcock and Scully just set
fire to the kitchen sink.

13:32.117 --> 13:34.919
Oh, boy.
Ooh, boy.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.086
Perfect!

13:36.087 --> 13:38.322
Let's use that.

13:38.323 --> 13:40.257
I looked everywhere.
I didn't find anything.

13:40.258 --> 13:41.492
- Did you?
- No.

13:41.493 --> 13:43.928
But mirror top coffee table,

13:43.929 --> 13:46.163
iguana cage,
samurai swords on the wall...

13:46.164 --> 13:47.498
either this guy is a drug dealer

13:47.499 --> 13:49.433
or uses an incautious
interior designer.

13:49.434 --> 13:51.235
He might be a drug dealer,
but we have nothing on him.

13:51.236 --> 13:52.503
Quick question, guys.

13:52.504 --> 13:55.639
Why did the drug dealer never do
his dishes?

13:55.640 --> 13:58.474
Because he has drugs
in his dishwasher.

13:58.510 --> 13:59.510
Oh, yeah!

13:59.511 --> 14:00.711
- Dishwasher?
- Hit me.

14:00.712 --> 14:02.112
Here, is for you.

14:02.113 --> 14:03.414
- Hello?
- Hey.

14:03.415 --> 14:04.748
What's up, dude?
It's me.

14:04.749 --> 14:06.182
We got the drugs, man.

14:06.217 --> 14:08.152
Hang on,
Charles wants to say hi.

14:08.153 --> 14:11.288
Do you have any milk?

14:11.289 --> 14:13.189
Not a stranger in sight.

14:13.224 --> 14:14.458
It's beautiful.

14:14.459 --> 14:16.627
I've never heard the printer
sound so happy.

14:16.628 --> 14:17.894
I feel like it knows.

14:17.929 --> 14:18.928
We did it.

14:18.930 --> 14:20.998
A new world.

14:20.999 --> 14:23.701
This must be how
the founding fathers felt.

14:23.702 --> 14:26.036
So...

14:26.037 --> 14:27.404
what are you doing out here?

14:27.405 --> 14:29.340
Captain, it's mayhem in there.

14:29.341 --> 14:31.709
Those people are messy
and selfish.

14:31.710 --> 14:32.810
- And chatty.
- And out here,

14:32.811 --> 14:34.243
we can actually get work done.

14:34.279 --> 14:35.980
- But...
- Sir, I'll handle this.

14:35.981 --> 14:36.981
We love it.

14:36.982 --> 14:37.982
We're proud of you.

14:37.983 --> 14:39.416
- We want in.
- No.

14:39.417 --> 14:41.618
You're acting like little
children playing basketball

14:41.619 --> 14:44.421
who've fallen behind by several
two-pointer buckets

14:44.422 --> 14:46.557
so you just take
your basket home,

14:46.558 --> 14:48.359
and now no one else can play.

14:48.360 --> 14:51.562
I know it's not the time,
but you gotta watch basketball

14:51.563 --> 14:52.795
if you're gonna try
to reference it.

14:52.831 --> 14:54.365
Sergeant,
this is boorish behavior.

14:54.366 --> 14:56.100
I wanted you to be a good host.

14:56.101 --> 14:57.301
You told me to make it work,

14:57.302 --> 14:59.169
and I came up
with a creative solution.

14:59.170 --> 15:01.205
Diaz finished
her arrest reports.

15:01.206 --> 15:03.540
Santiago did the filing
of ten men.

15:03.541 --> 15:04.707
I don't want to hear it.

15:04.743 --> 15:09.145
Just clean up this mess
and get back inside.

15:10.515 --> 15:11.682
[printer beeping]

15:11.683 --> 15:13.617
Paper jam.

15:13.618 --> 15:15.418
It does know.

15:15.453 --> 15:17.721
Attenzione, dingbats.

15:17.722 --> 15:20.457
Perchance a riddle.
Shakespeare.

15:20.458 --> 15:23.894
What has six thumbs
and just arrested a drug dealer?

15:23.895 --> 15:25.762
Both: These guys.

15:25.797 --> 15:26.930
[chuckles]

15:26.931 --> 15:28.699
Charles, thumbs up.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.401
I said "six thumbs"
and we're only showing four.

15:30.402 --> 15:31.535
We're starting
to look like fools.

15:31.536 --> 15:32.569
Come on, Charles.

15:32.570 --> 15:33.670
There it is.

15:33.671 --> 15:35.005
- That's the ticket.
- Whoo!

15:35.006 --> 15:36.572
All right, man, I'm gonna go
check with Flynt.

15:36.608 --> 15:38.776
You do some research on where
we're gonna celebrate tonight.

15:38.777 --> 15:40.177
Here's my only requirement:

15:40.178 --> 15:42.779
it has to be at your house
'cause I ain't got no money.

15:42.814 --> 15:44.580
Uh, okay,
how about at my house?

15:44.616 --> 15:45.716
Swurt.

15:45.717 --> 15:47.851
[both laughing]

15:47.852 --> 15:49.319
Yes!

15:49.320 --> 15:50.421
[sighs]

15:50.422 --> 15:51.722
Psst, hey.

15:51.723 --> 15:52.723
What are you doing?

15:52.724 --> 15:53.723
Come here.

15:55.293 --> 15:56.460
What?

15:56.461 --> 15:58.128
I think Stevie's bad news.

15:58.129 --> 16:00.030
What?
Oh, come on, Charles.

16:00.031 --> 16:02.332
You know, you've been acting
weird about Stevie all day.

16:02.333 --> 16:03.967
I think you might be jealous.

16:03.968 --> 16:05.002
Of course I'm jealous.

16:05.003 --> 16:06.236
I was never hiding that.

16:06.237 --> 16:07.838
- How?
- He's tall. He's funny.

16:07.839 --> 16:08.906
He can pull off an earring.

16:08.907 --> 16:10.107
He doesn't have an earring.

16:10.108 --> 16:11.507
But we both know
he'd look good with one.

16:11.543 --> 16:13.444
Oh, my God... What do you
want me to say, Boyle?

16:13.445 --> 16:15.712
I've been trying to include you
in this all day long.

16:15.713 --> 16:18.282
And, yes, I forgot you
that one time,

16:18.283 --> 16:19.283
but I made up for it.

16:19.284 --> 16:20.684
I slapped you in the face.

16:20.685 --> 16:22.019
You're supposed to be
my friend.

16:22.020 --> 16:23.954
I'm an adult man,
I can have two close friends.

16:23.955 --> 16:25.395
Hell, I can have
three close friends.

16:25.423 --> 16:27.091
- You wouldn't.
- I would.

16:27.092 --> 16:28.225
- [scoffs]
- Maybe I'll get in touch

16:28.226 --> 16:29.626
with my friend James
from college.

16:29.627 --> 16:31.195
Ooh, or you know who just
looked me up online?

16:31.196 --> 16:32.195
Brad from camp.

16:32.197 --> 16:34.098
Stevie planted the drugs.

16:34.099 --> 16:35.599
Come on!

16:35.600 --> 16:38.134
I looked on that dishwasher
before him, and it was empty.

16:38.169 --> 16:39.660
Stevie planted those pills.

16:39.671 --> 16:41.805
But you're right,
he's the coolest!

16:41.806 --> 16:43.941
You guys should go get
your ears pierced together.

16:43.942 --> 16:45.875
Invite Brad.
It'll be smurt.

16:47.145 --> 16:49.580
It's swurt, not smurt.

16:49.581 --> 16:51.848
So, joke it's on you.

16:51.849 --> 16:52.882
Damn it, Stevie!

16:55.227 --> 16:56.461
Hey, I logged the drugs.

16:56.462 --> 16:58.396
You know what that means.
It's time to celebrate.

16:58.397 --> 17:00.698
You know what that means.
Let's eat big sandwiches!

17:00.699 --> 17:01.900
I gotta talk to you...

17:01.901 --> 17:03.368
in private.

17:03.369 --> 17:04.800
Come on.

17:06.872 --> 17:08.605
Okay.

17:09.842 --> 17:11.509
Uh, this is cozy.

17:11.510 --> 17:12.911
Well, the precinct
is so crowded,

17:12.912 --> 17:14.846
this is the only place
no one can hear us talk.

17:14.847 --> 17:16.814
[deep breath]
Listen.

17:16.815 --> 17:19.250
I know you planted the drugs
at Ozerov's place.

17:19.251 --> 17:20.285
What?

17:20.286 --> 17:21.553
Charles checked
the dishwasher,

17:21.554 --> 17:22.887
and he didn't see any drugs.

17:22.887 --> 17:24.155
Yeah, well, they were there.
All right?

17:24.156 --> 17:25.455
I guess he just missed them.

17:25.457 --> 17:27.858
Probably busy hiking up his
pants above this belly button.

17:27.859 --> 17:29.427
He has to do that
because they don't make pants

17:29.428 --> 17:30.728
short enough for him.

17:30.729 --> 17:32.730
Look.
Don't lie to me, man.

17:32.731 --> 17:35.500
Dude, the guy
is a drug dealer.

17:35.501 --> 17:36.634
All right?

17:36.635 --> 17:38.069
I wasn't gonna
let him walk again.

17:38.070 --> 17:39.270
But you get it,
though, right?

17:39.271 --> 17:40.805
You're not a tight-ass
like Charles.

17:40.806 --> 17:42.173
You know, I wish
I was like Charles.

17:42.174 --> 17:44.008
He's a good cop
and an honest person,

17:44.009 --> 17:46.778
and when we go on stakeouts,
we do listen to Toni Braxton

17:46.779 --> 17:49.314
and it's super sad
and it's awesome.

17:49.315 --> 17:50.915
I can't believe
I'm saying this, Stevie,

17:50.916 --> 17:52.750
but I gotta report you.

17:52.751 --> 17:54.385
Ow!

17:54.386 --> 17:56.054
Did you just Donkey Kong
punch me?

17:56.055 --> 17:57.655
There's no room
to regular punch you.

17:57.656 --> 18:02.260
[both grunting]

18:02.261 --> 18:03.328
Ooh, all right.

18:03.329 --> 18:04.329
It's on.

18:04.330 --> 18:05.630
- Ahh!
- What's going on?

18:05.631 --> 18:06.831
He did plant the drugs.

18:06.832 --> 18:07.865
You trusted me.

18:07.866 --> 18:09.067
Oww!

18:09.068 --> 18:10.535
Son of a bitch!
I hope there's room

18:10.536 --> 18:12.544
- in this fight for three.
- There's not.

18:17.270 --> 18:20.606
You have a 2:30 meeting
with small head big body.

18:20.607 --> 18:22.073
I forgot to take his name.

18:22.109 --> 18:23.476
D.A. Brayburn.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.010
Deputy Inspector Flynt,

18:25.011 --> 18:26.611
do you mind if we have
a meeting here in the office?

18:26.646 --> 18:27.813
Actually, I do mind.

18:27.814 --> 18:29.448
I'm not really in the mood
for company.

18:29.449 --> 18:32.051
I just had a bad loss
in an online poker game.

18:32.052 --> 18:33.151
Of course.

18:33.186 --> 18:34.487
Anything for our guests.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.154
Get back here,
you crap basket.

18:36.189 --> 18:37.189
You're going down!

18:37.190 --> 18:38.257
Help!

18:38.258 --> 18:39.725
He's attacking me
for no reason!

18:39.726 --> 18:41.060
[both grunt, all gasp]

18:41.061 --> 18:43.629
Stevie Schillens,
you have the right to remain...

18:43.630 --> 18:44.764
- A loser.
- Noice.

18:44.765 --> 18:46.866
But, now legally,
I have to start over, Charles.

18:46.867 --> 18:48.334
Stevie Schill... Oh!

18:48.335 --> 18:49.401
[all gasp]

18:49.402 --> 18:50.870
Get off him.
We just made up.

18:50.871 --> 18:53.105
[grunting]

18:53.106 --> 18:54.240
Paul?

18:54.241 --> 18:55.507
I thought we had something.

18:55.542 --> 18:56.642
[grunts]

18:56.643 --> 18:57.643
Get nine-eight.

18:57.644 --> 18:58.744
[all chattering]

18:58.745 --> 19:01.447
Hope your dog
will help with neck pain.

19:01.448 --> 19:02.915
Oh!
She doesn't help with any pain.

19:02.916 --> 19:04.016
I made it up.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.417
Ha!
I knew it!

19:05.418 --> 19:06.786
Hey, Ellen.

19:06.787 --> 19:08.119
I got your farm girl.

19:08.155 --> 19:09.154
You wouldn't.

19:10.657 --> 19:12.124
Bessy!

19:12.125 --> 19:14.059
Terry got his computer back.

19:14.060 --> 19:15.928
[grunts]

19:15.929 --> 19:18.430
Oh, come on!

19:18.431 --> 19:21.432
[yelling and groaning]

19:23.542 --> 19:25.838
Sarge, take off your shirt!

19:25.839 --> 19:28.374
It's restricting your movement.

19:28.375 --> 19:32.243
[bullhorn blares]

19:32.279 --> 19:34.480
What the hell
is going on here?

19:34.481 --> 19:35.848
Yeah.

19:35.849 --> 19:38.083
What are you guys doing?

19:38.084 --> 19:40.686
Brawling with other
police officers?

19:40.687 --> 19:41.754
What were you thinking?

19:41.755 --> 19:44.023
Sir, I had nothing
to do with this.

19:44.024 --> 19:46.125
I was arresting a dirty cop.

19:46.126 --> 19:48.660
I heard you scream out
"I love this!"

19:48.695 --> 19:49.862
Yes.

19:49.863 --> 19:52.231
"This" being justice.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.232
I love justice.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.667
And to make matters worse,

19:54.668 --> 19:58.637
our radiator was broken during
your wild street-ball scrum.

19:58.638 --> 20:00.406
So now we have no heat.

20:00.407 --> 20:02.141
Which means we'll have to work
in the freezing cold,

20:02.142 --> 20:03.609
and our guests
from the nine-eight

20:03.610 --> 20:06.745
will have to relocate again.

20:06.746 --> 20:08.681
No smiles.
No smiles.

20:08.682 --> 20:10.416
This is a sad day
for our precinct.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.550
Dismissed.

20:11.551 --> 20:13.985
[all grumbling]

20:14.020 --> 20:15.520
Captain.

20:15.555 --> 20:17.002
You know what's kinda weird?

20:17.023 --> 20:19.463
There was no one was fighting
over by the radiator.

20:19.492 --> 20:22.126
You were the only person
standing near it.

20:24.164 --> 20:26.932
I suppose, in the hubbub,

20:26.933 --> 20:29.501
I may have tripped
and busted a pipe.

20:29.502 --> 20:30.502
[all yelling, metallic clank]

20:30.503 --> 20:34.440
[steam hissing]

20:34.441 --> 20:35.774
I knew it!

20:35.775 --> 20:38.244
I knew you couldn't stand
having someone in your space.

20:38.245 --> 20:39.578
He used my letter opener

20:39.579 --> 20:41.547
to cut his tuna sandwich
in half!

20:41.548 --> 20:43.382
You were right.

20:43.383 --> 20:45.149
They were disrespectful
and had to go.

20:45.185 --> 20:47.086
And, yes, sometimes
you have to come up

20:47.087 --> 20:48.888
with a creative solution.

20:48.889 --> 20:51.457
And sometimes just a bunch
of dudes need to get into a room

20:51.458 --> 20:53.859
and just...
[grunting]

20:53.860 --> 20:56.842
"Take that!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"

20:57.844 --> 20:59.689
That's not the lesson here.

20:59.690 --> 21:01.392
