WEBVTT

00:27.586 --> 00:29.354
What are you doing?

00:29.421 --> 00:31.289
I'm
capturing the moment.

00:31.356 --> 00:32.759
Do you always have
to film everything?

00:32.825 --> 00:34.226
Stop!

00:51.309 --> 00:53.378
Go on, go on.

00:53.445 --> 00:55.247
You say you love the 4th.

00:55.313 --> 00:58.651
Yeah, and sparklers
and fireworks.

00:58.718 --> 01:00.285
Yeah, and picnics.

01:01.020 --> 01:02.421
- Heck yeah.
- Okay, yeah,

01:02.487 --> 01:03.790
what else?

01:03.856 --> 01:04.791
Oh, kids.

01:25.712 --> 01:26.511
- Nevermind.
- Oh, sorry.

01:26.578 --> 01:28.848
No.

01:28.915 --> 01:30.783
What are you doing?

01:30.850 --> 01:32.584
What are you doing?

01:32.652 --> 01:33.518
David?

01:36.388 --> 01:37.857
What are you doing?

01:39.025 --> 01:40.860
Grace, I want to
ask you a question.

01:40.927 --> 01:42.862
Yeah?

01:42.929 --> 01:45.865
Would you please give
me your ring finger

01:45.932 --> 01:47.033
so I may propose to you?

01:48.968 --> 01:50.737
Jesus!

01:50.803 --> 01:53.773
Put on the full armor of God

01:55.141 --> 01:58.911
so you can take a stand
against the devil's schemes.

02:00.512 --> 02:02.614
He's the only one
who can help you.

02:03.816 --> 02:04.684
Okay, okay.

02:09.454 --> 02:10.322
Hello?

02:37.083 --> 02:37.950
Hey?

04:20.253 --> 04:22.554
I was really nervous to show up.

04:22.621 --> 04:23.555
- It's fine, my fault
- I hope

04:23.622 --> 04:24.957
- I don't have a phone.
- it's okay.

04:25.024 --> 04:26.058
Of course.

04:26.125 --> 04:27.727
You're my little sister.

04:30.129 --> 04:33.099
- I didn't have time to tidy up.
- Oh, my God.

04:49.782 --> 04:51.817
I thought you'd redesign
the whole place.

04:54.820 --> 04:57.089
Cat,
this is amazing.

04:58.556 --> 05:00.492
I can't believe this
whole house is yours.

05:00.558 --> 05:02.194
Well you weren't old
enough to get it, so.

05:02.261 --> 05:04.462
No, it's good,
I'm glad you did.

05:06.999 --> 05:12.004
Is that our
Magicland?

05:13.339 --> 05:15.507
I dug it out of storage
before Abby was born.

05:28.688 --> 05:29.822
I missed you.

05:33.926 --> 05:35.795
I'm really sorry I
wasn't there for you

05:35.861 --> 05:37.296
when you needed me.

05:37.363 --> 05:39.065
And here you are
when I need you.

05:43.336 --> 05:44.602
I'm the big sister.

05:45.838 --> 05:46.973
It's my job to protect.

05:57.650 --> 05:58.851
Take a look around.

06:00.753 --> 06:01.954
I'm in the downstairs bedroom.

06:02.021 --> 06:03.488
You're in Mom and
Dad's old room.

06:04.223 --> 06:05.490
I never go in there.

06:07.293 --> 06:09.795
Yeah, okay.

06:11.998 --> 06:15.101
Um, I need to sort out an idea

06:15.167 --> 06:17.303
for my thesis for next semester.

06:17.370 --> 06:18.904
Do you have WiFi?

06:18.971 --> 06:20.706
No central heat either.

06:20.773 --> 06:21.874
Oh, yeah.

06:23.776 --> 06:25.778
Go on, take a look around.

06:25.845 --> 06:27.713
I have to get some
more wood chopped.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.117
Do you need some help?

06:31.183 --> 06:32.118
You bring an ax?

11:05.491 --> 11:07.326
Will you help me
carry the firewood in?

11:10.362 --> 11:12.931
You wouldn't move.

11:14.300 --> 11:16.636
You couldn't have gotten out
of the way for two seconds.

11:16.703 --> 11:18.304
Instead you just...

11:18.370 --> 11:20.339
I thought I'd rather
stand my ground.

11:20.406 --> 11:22.308
And how did that work out?

11:22.374 --> 11:23.909
It's hard to remember.

11:23.976 --> 11:27.012
Yeah, concussions tend
to have that effect.

11:30.582 --> 11:32.418
How many days are you staying?

11:32.484 --> 11:35.187
You
sick of me already?

11:36.322 --> 11:40.326
No, I just, I don't
drink much anymore.

11:40.392 --> 11:43.228
Well, drink up.

11:43.295 --> 11:44.563
It's a special occasion.

11:44.631 --> 11:46.365
Your little sister's in town.

11:48.367 --> 11:50.002
I'm sorry your
engagement is off.

11:50.069 --> 11:51.303
Yeah, well,

11:53.972 --> 11:56.108
I'm not.

11:56.175 --> 11:57.343
What can I say?

11:59.011 --> 12:01.480
They were horny and
I was passed out.

12:01.547 --> 12:03.916
It's kinda my fault
if you think about it.

12:03.982 --> 12:05.084
Grace.

12:05.150 --> 12:07.052
And on my birthday, too.

12:07.119 --> 12:10.055
Yeah, well,

12:10.122 --> 12:11.090
they're both lying assholes.

12:11.156 --> 12:13.158
They will be perfect
for each other.

12:13.225 --> 12:14.393
- Grace.
- What?

12:16.995 --> 12:18.130
It's okay to be hurt.

12:19.733 --> 12:21.166
You don't have to hide it.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.403
You loved them and
they betrayed you.

12:26.138 --> 12:28.173
My own husband did
the same thing.

12:30.275 --> 12:31.176
After court, I,

12:33.112 --> 12:34.213
I begged him to
bring Abby up here

12:34.279 --> 12:35.414
so I could say goodbye.

12:39.385 --> 12:40.052
I'm sorry.

12:42.087 --> 12:43.288
I pretended to hate him

12:44.356 --> 12:46.258
'cause I didn't wanna be hurt.

12:46.325 --> 12:49.061
Letting myself feel sad is
the only way I could heal.

12:50.429 --> 12:53.031
I'm sad I can't always hear
the floorboards crying.

12:54.333 --> 12:56.568
They're loud sometimes and
sleeping makes my stomach hurt.

12:56.636 --> 12:58.437
What?

12:58.504 --> 13:01.173
What?

13:02.040 --> 13:03.041
It's time for bed.

13:04.677 --> 13:05.645
I sleep when the sun goes down.

13:05.712 --> 13:07.613
I like to keep a
consistent pattern.

13:09.314 --> 13:10.650
Please do the same.

13:12.050 --> 13:14.253
Okay, ma'am.

13:14.319 --> 13:16.054
The
dishes can wait.

13:19.224 --> 13:20.559
Good night.

14:35.601 --> 14:36.468
David.

14:53.352 --> 14:55.087
Do you love me?

14:55.153 --> 14:55.822
Yeah.

14:57.891 --> 15:00.225
Will you always love me?

15:01.460 --> 15:02.762
No.

15:48.373 --> 15:50.643
I like the Rainbow Crunch.

15:55.447 --> 15:57.282
Where are you going?

15:57.349 --> 15:59.217
It's your turn.

15:59.284 --> 16:00.820
I don't want to
play hide and seek.

16:00.887 --> 16:02.354
I want to play Magicland.

16:04.389 --> 16:05.758
If you don't play your turn,

16:05.825 --> 16:07.559
Penny's gonna play for you.

16:09.561 --> 16:10.697
Abby?

16:16.636 --> 16:17.737
- What are you doing?
- Jesus.

16:17.804 --> 16:18.838
Why are you spying on me?

16:18.905 --> 16:20.205
- I wasn't spying.
- What are you doing?

16:20.272 --> 16:22.875
I was cold, I was just
coming to get another blanket.

16:22.942 --> 16:24.877
I will get you a blanket!

16:24.944 --> 16:27.379
Cat, you're freaking me out.

16:27.446 --> 16:28.513
Are you okay?

16:29.548 --> 16:30.415
I'm fine.

16:31.450 --> 16:32.317
Get some sleep.

16:33.653 --> 16:34.519
Good night!

16:36.555 --> 16:37.657
Night, Cat.

17:00.947 --> 17:05.885
Okay, um, it's December 18th.

17:09.689 --> 17:13.558
I guess I don't really
know how to start.

17:13.626 --> 17:14.627
This is stupid.

17:22.434 --> 17:24.637
I'm Grace Elizabeth Crawford.

17:24.704 --> 17:26.806
It's December 18th and
I'm on winter break.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.779
I don't really know
why I'm recording this.

17:32.845 --> 17:35.648
Dammit, I'm completely
not sure about the ethics

17:35.715 --> 17:36.849
of this either.

17:36.916 --> 17:37.784
My sister,

17:41.854 --> 17:42.955
my sister...

17:46.993 --> 17:49.629
She moved here six years ago,

17:49.696 --> 17:51.964
our family's old cabin
in the middle of nowhere.

17:53.700 --> 17:54.667
She moved here six years ago

17:54.734 --> 17:56.703
shortly after
divorcing her husband.

17:58.037 --> 18:01.406
I haven't spoken to her
much since her move here.

18:01.473 --> 18:02.340
No phone.

18:03.475 --> 18:06.411
I wrote her letters,
she rarely writes back.

18:09.015 --> 18:11.050
Since arriving, I've
noticed her displaying

18:11.117 --> 18:12.885
several symptoms of someone...

18:15.922 --> 18:16.989
She has been...

18:19.959 --> 18:21.226
My sister.

18:30.502 --> 18:31.369
Good morning.

18:32.404 --> 18:33.572
Coffee?

18:33.639 --> 18:34.974
Sure.

18:39.478 --> 18:40.847
You sleep okay?

18:40.913 --> 18:41.781
Sure.

18:44.483 --> 18:46.451
The blanket helped, thank you.

18:46.518 --> 18:47.920
It's really cold in that room.

18:50.589 --> 18:51.958
I don't go in that room.

18:57.630 --> 18:58.931
Everything okay?

19:00.066 --> 19:03.401
Yeah, my stomach's
not feeling great.

19:03.468 --> 19:05.337
- I have some antacids.
- Oh, no, I'm fine,

19:05.403 --> 19:06.404
really.

19:06.471 --> 19:07.305
One or two?

19:09.075 --> 19:09.942
Okay.

19:18.951 --> 19:21.687
You wanna talk about last night?

19:23.488 --> 19:24.556
What's
to talk about?

19:27.526 --> 19:28.995
You were talking like a child.

19:36.601 --> 19:38.303
I was tidying up.

19:41.107 --> 19:42.574
You were talking to Abby.

19:44.143 --> 19:48.681
But Abby isn't there Catherine.

19:51.616 --> 19:53.786
Cat, talk to me.

19:56.722 --> 19:58.791
You think I don't know that?

19:58.858 --> 20:01.961
You think I don't know that
my daughter isn't here?

20:02.028 --> 20:03.495
You think I need you to
drive all the way up here

20:03.562 --> 20:04.529
to tell me that?

20:05.497 --> 20:06.833
You have no idea what it's like

20:06.899 --> 20:09.434
having your daughter
just taken from you!

20:11.971 --> 20:15.141
Cat, oh, Cat, come
here, come here.

20:16.575 --> 20:17.844
It's gonna be okay.

20:17.910 --> 20:19.544
It's gonna be okay.

20:19.611 --> 20:20.813
Shh, it's okay.

20:28.721 --> 20:30.422
Do you remember
holding me like this?

20:33.125 --> 20:33.993
At night?

20:36.062 --> 20:37.096
I was six.

20:39.632 --> 20:40.565
When Mom died.

20:43.035 --> 20:45.470
And I didn't understand
why she would do that.

20:47.039 --> 20:49.108
And Dad didn't take it well.

20:49.175 --> 20:50.643
He'd spend all his
time at the cabin

20:50.710 --> 20:51.844
and leave us home alone.

20:54.046 --> 20:56.949
He just didn't know how to
deal with all my questions.

21:01.087 --> 21:02.554
You remember what scared me?

21:04.190 --> 21:05.758
Nothing.

21:05.825 --> 21:08.694
Yeah, nothing.

21:10.663 --> 21:11.797
The thought of nothing.

21:13.065 --> 21:14.066
Not existing.

21:17.703 --> 21:18.804
I was okay when I
thought of death

21:18.871 --> 21:20.505
as heaven or hell, but nothing?

21:22.308 --> 21:23.809
Nothing scared me.

21:24.911 --> 21:27.013
Mom not existing at all.

21:28.981 --> 21:30.082
I couldn't sleep.

21:31.984 --> 21:34.519
I'd lay awake and cry

21:35.688 --> 21:37.056
while you held me like this.

21:42.594 --> 21:45.765
Do you remember what
you did to fix me?

21:45.831 --> 21:46.431
Yeah.

21:46.498 --> 21:49.936
Yeah.

21:50.002 --> 21:52.171
You made me play
with a Spirit Board.

21:55.241 --> 21:56.876
You made me believe in spirits.

21:59.211 --> 22:02.014
You showed me that
nothing doesn't exist.

22:06.252 --> 22:08.220
You showed me how to
talk to Mom again.

22:11.357 --> 22:13.159
I pushed the planchette.

22:14.260 --> 22:15.127
I know.

22:19.365 --> 22:21.133
You did what I
needed at the time.

22:29.075 --> 22:29.976
I'm here for you.

22:32.712 --> 22:34.013
You can talk to me.

22:36.248 --> 22:41.253
What's wrong?

22:42.288 --> 22:43.322
It's right there.

22:45.758 --> 22:49.628
The electricity is
listening right behind her.

22:51.931 --> 22:53.132
You can see it.

23:08.314 --> 23:10.216
I have to feed the chickens.

24:05.237 --> 24:06.939
No, no, no, no, no.

24:07.006 --> 24:08.274
No, no, no.

24:08.340 --> 24:09.341
No, no, no.

24:11.343 --> 24:14.680
No, no.

24:27.793 --> 24:28.661
Abby?

24:29.795 --> 24:32.164
Abby you weren't in
Mommy's pills, were you?

24:35.801 --> 24:39.604
Abby, you know we can't
play in Mommy's room.

24:41.507 --> 24:44.143
Abby, Mommy will be very
upset if you play in here.

24:46.011 --> 24:46.879
Abby?

24:48.013 --> 24:48.881
Abby?

24:50.316 --> 24:51.183
Abby?

24:59.158 --> 25:01.260
It's December 19th now.

25:02.895 --> 25:07.867
Oh, okay, so, um...

25:09.902 --> 25:13.873
Okay, she is talking
like a child now.

25:15.875 --> 25:16.709
Penny.

25:22.448 --> 25:25.351
My mother was diagnosed
with paranoid schizophrenia

25:25.417 --> 25:27.019
when she was pregnant with me.

25:28.888 --> 25:31.023
I never knew the mother
that my sister knew

25:31.090 --> 25:33.225
or the woman my father did.

25:33.292 --> 25:34.360
I was too young.

25:36.395 --> 25:38.230
She, like many victims,

25:39.198 --> 25:40.166
took her own life.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.368
Mommy?

25:42.434 --> 25:43.335
I blamed myself.

25:45.204 --> 25:46.071
I triggered it.

25:50.442 --> 25:52.044
Come on, Grace.

25:52.111 --> 25:53.345
Detach and analyze.

25:58.250 --> 25:59.118
Today,

26:00.986 --> 26:04.924
today I found prescription
antipsychotic medication

26:04.990 --> 26:05.858
in my sister's,

26:09.295 --> 26:11.830
my, my big sister's...

26:19.104 --> 26:19.972
I'm scared.

26:24.243 --> 26:25.177
Grace?

26:26.445 --> 26:27.313
Just a second.

26:31.183 --> 26:32.785
Grace?

26:32.851 --> 26:33.719
Yeah?

26:38.524 --> 26:40.859
Are
you feeling better?

26:40.926 --> 26:42.361
I'm still a bit nauseated.

26:44.396 --> 26:45.931
- I
- brought some soup.

26:46.932 --> 26:49.134
Oh, my god.

26:49.201 --> 26:51.837
- Is that our...
- Yeah, I,

26:51.904 --> 26:56.108
I kept it, I thought I'd try
being the big sister again.

27:00.379 --> 27:02.014
Are their any spirits present

27:02.081 --> 27:03.749
who wish to communicate with us?

27:13.359 --> 27:15.427
What is your name spirit?

27:30.309 --> 27:32.044
- Who's Penny?
- Stop moving it.

27:35.047 --> 27:36.181
Ask it something else.

27:41.220 --> 27:44.390
Spirit, is my sister
having a boy or a girl?

27:46.025 --> 27:47.192
Why would you say that?

27:48.227 --> 27:49.128
To protect you.

27:50.697 --> 27:53.465
It started happening to me
after I gave birth to Abby.

27:56.268 --> 27:57.136
Paranoia.

27:59.204 --> 28:00.072
Grace,

28:05.477 --> 28:07.613
I started hearing things.

28:12.985 --> 28:13.852
Voices.

28:15.321 --> 28:18.190
Telling me that Jerry
would hurt our baby.

28:20.592 --> 28:21.960
I started seeing things.

28:25.164 --> 28:26.598
You know that's why
Mom killed herself.

28:26.666 --> 28:28.233
- Catherine...
- Dad said she started

28:28.300 --> 28:30.269
to see a man in
the house at night.

28:32.338 --> 28:33.906
The shadow.

28:33.972 --> 28:35.574
What are you talking about?

28:35.642 --> 28:38.610
She wouldn't take
her medication.

28:41.648 --> 28:42.716
It's hereditary, Grace.

28:42.782 --> 28:45.050
- I know that.
- I didn't wanna tell you

28:45.117 --> 28:47.586
what had happened or
what could happen.

28:47.654 --> 28:50.255
I'm not hearing things.

28:51.457 --> 28:52.991
Or seeing things.

28:56.995 --> 28:57.630
Grace,

29:03.068 --> 29:04.637
I've been suffering
from mild schizophrenia

29:04.704 --> 29:06.605
since Abby was born.

29:06.673 --> 29:09.408
I started hearing things
and Jerry and I fought.

29:11.543 --> 29:13.379
He thought I was dangerous,

29:13.445 --> 29:15.180
but I would never hurt Abby.

29:18.150 --> 29:19.284
Are you on medication?

29:22.454 --> 29:23.322
Yes.

29:26.392 --> 29:28.293
It keeps me normal
for the most part.

29:30.562 --> 29:32.331
Sometimes I have
trouble sleeping.

29:34.299 --> 29:36.101
I get sick, my focus is off,

29:36.168 --> 29:38.303
but patterns help.

29:39.405 --> 29:40.673
The cabin helps.

29:42.341 --> 29:44.109
Being alone helps.

29:45.444 --> 29:49.047
Being alone is where the walls
don't scream for a vacation.

29:55.053 --> 30:00.058
Grace, please just let
me be alone up here.

30:00.760 --> 30:02.294
Just keep it our little secret.

30:04.396 --> 30:05.264
Who's Penny?

30:13.272 --> 30:17.943
Penny, I don't really
wanna talk about it.

30:18.711 --> 30:20.179
It's embarrassing.

30:21.748 --> 30:23.115
Does Penny talk to you?

30:26.185 --> 30:27.052
Do you see her?

30:27.921 --> 30:30.155
Penny is how I talk to Abby.

30:33.091 --> 30:35.227
I'm coping, I know, I read it.

30:37.797 --> 30:39.097
But when I'm Penny,

30:41.099 --> 30:41.734
I can see Abby.

30:45.237 --> 30:46.438
So is Penny real?

30:47.406 --> 30:48.407
Do you hear her?

30:48.474 --> 30:51.376
No, Grace, I'm
just a mother coping

30:51.443 --> 30:53.412
with having her
daughter taken from her.

30:54.781 --> 30:57.249
Okay, after the divorce,
I didn't know what to do.

30:57.316 --> 31:00.586
So I came here, I
thought I could just

31:00.653 --> 31:03.088
get away from the noise.

31:03.155 --> 31:06.325
Sustain myself, prove to Jerry

31:06.391 --> 31:07.392
that I'm better.

31:10.262 --> 31:11.631
I begged him.

31:11.698 --> 31:14.600
I begged him to
bring Abby up here.

31:18.403 --> 31:21.306
I just wanted to see my
daughter one last time.

31:25.845 --> 31:26.713
Did he come?

31:29.615 --> 31:30.482
No.

31:32.719 --> 31:33.720
What happened?

31:36.421 --> 31:37.322
I don't know.

31:41.260 --> 31:42.094
He's gone.

31:47.499 --> 31:49.201
I just started telling you this

31:49.268 --> 31:50.402
because I ,

31:55.240 --> 31:57.810
I don't want it
to happen to you.

32:01.714 --> 32:02.581
Okay.

32:06.485 --> 32:07.352
Cat.

32:11.323 --> 32:12.190
I love you.

32:15.360 --> 32:16.696
I love you too.

32:32.611 --> 32:34.279
You stupid bitch.

32:45.524 --> 32:47.092
I don't want you.

32:56.234 --> 32:57.436
Should I have the baby?

33:09.949 --> 33:11.516
Will I regret it?

33:34.439 --> 33:36.308
Is it a boy or a girl?

34:34.634 --> 34:35.500
David?

34:36.903 --> 34:38.236
- Oh.
- Morgan?

34:43.608 --> 34:44.476
Grace.

34:45.945 --> 34:46.813
I'm, I'm.

34:56.656 --> 34:57.890
You're better off alone.

35:36.561 --> 35:38.430
You sleep okay?

35:38.497 --> 35:39.397
I slept better.

35:40.800 --> 35:41.768
You almost done?

35:41.834 --> 35:43.602
I was gonna make
us some breakfast.

35:43.669 --> 35:44.536
It's 4 p.m.

35:45.938 --> 35:46.806
What?

35:48.507 --> 35:49.909
You slept the day away, sis.

35:51.409 --> 35:53.045
I gotta finish up
with this wood,

35:53.112 --> 35:54.947
get some to the
house, to the shed.

35:55.882 --> 35:56.849
Feed the chickens.

36:00.086 --> 36:01.921
- I can cook some dinner.
- No, no,

36:01.988 --> 36:04.090
I made some steak
and kidney pies.

36:04.157 --> 36:06.025
They're in the fridge.

36:06.092 --> 36:07.827
Can you just get
those in the oven?

36:09.095 --> 36:11.363
Uh, yeah, okay.

36:12.965 --> 36:15.034
Will you take a pile of
wood back to the house for me?

36:18.204 --> 36:19.304
Yeah, of course.

36:47.465 --> 36:48.333
Hello?

36:52.238 --> 36:53.371
Come on, Grace.

37:38.516 --> 37:39.785
Dear heavenly father,

37:39.852 --> 37:41.087
thank you for this bounty
you have blessed us with.

37:41.153 --> 37:43.856
Please let this food nourish
us and keep us strong.

37:45.925 --> 37:48.060
Thank you Lord for this
time with my sister.

37:48.995 --> 37:50.997
In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

37:51.063 --> 37:51.931
Amen.

38:14.220 --> 38:15.821
Last night I had nightmares.

38:19.557 --> 38:20.826
You
slept a long time.

38:28.634 --> 38:30.236
Do you see things often?

38:30.303 --> 38:32.238
Are the voices always there?

38:32.305 --> 38:33.839
What are you talking about?

38:35.074 --> 38:36.108
The voices.

38:37.977 --> 38:39.011
Seeing things.

38:40.713 --> 38:41.948
Seeing Abby.

38:44.884 --> 38:46.618
How long where
you two engaged?

38:49.322 --> 38:50.189
A few months.

38:52.590 --> 38:54.126
David proposed on
the 4th of July.

38:55.094 --> 38:56.729
So he wouldn't forget the date.

39:00.366 --> 39:01.934
Did it start with the dreams?

39:02.001 --> 39:02.868
The paranoia?

39:06.072 --> 39:07.039
Have you talked with Morgan

39:07.106 --> 39:09.308
since you walked
in on them fucking?

39:09.375 --> 39:10.810
She was one of your
best friends, right?

39:10.876 --> 39:11.644
What?

39:11.711 --> 39:12.945
What, are they engaged now?

39:13.012 --> 39:14.080
Did you keep the ring?

39:14.146 --> 39:15.715
I don't know, why
are you asking me this?

39:15.781 --> 39:16.581
I don't wanna talk about it.

39:16.649 --> 39:17.515
Exactly.

39:23.990 --> 39:24.857
How's the pie?

39:28.327 --> 39:28.995
I'm sorry.

39:31.330 --> 39:32.631
It's really good, actually.

39:46.912 --> 39:48.981
I get half a cow from a
farm a mile up the road.

39:51.183 --> 39:52.785
Milk, eggs, phone.

39:54.687 --> 39:55.587
It's a good walk.

39:56.689 --> 39:58.024
It lasts me through the winter.

40:02.928 --> 40:03.796
You were right.

40:09.235 --> 40:10.069
I'm pregnant.

40:16.075 --> 40:18.878
I didn't get peas the
last time I was town.

40:18.944 --> 40:20.813
The Brits typically
eat it with peas.

40:31.957 --> 40:33.125
I heard things.

40:38.197 --> 40:39.564
And the dreams.

40:51.477 --> 40:54.113
My sister is suffering
from mild schizophrenia.

40:55.981 --> 40:57.049
She calls it mild.

40:58.851 --> 40:59.819
She's in and out.

41:02.388 --> 41:03.322
But overall,

41:04.957 --> 41:07.893
she seems to be fine up here.

41:09.195 --> 41:10.629
For how long, I don't know

41:11.997 --> 41:13.899
whether the disease gets worse

41:13.966 --> 41:17.136
or she has long-term side
effects from the drugs.

41:19.271 --> 41:20.106
I don't know.

41:24.777 --> 41:26.212
She doesn't want me
to share any of this

41:26.278 --> 41:27.379
with the outside world.

41:27.446 --> 41:31.050
She thinks being alone
is the best solution.

41:31.117 --> 41:33.786
I don't know how long a
solution it will be, though.

41:38.824 --> 41:40.960
Will I see my sister
again after this trip?

41:47.933 --> 41:50.769
I think it must have been easier

41:50.836 --> 41:54.240
when people believed it
was demonic possession.

41:54.306 --> 41:54.974
Spiritual.

41:56.775 --> 41:57.943
It was easier when I did.

41:59.278 --> 42:02.381
With that there's hope or blame.

42:03.916 --> 42:04.950
The boogeyman did it.

42:07.219 --> 42:08.354
Call it a disease

42:09.488 --> 42:11.390
and there is no boogeyman.

42:11.457 --> 42:12.324
No one to blame

42:14.193 --> 42:15.327
except your parents

42:17.930 --> 42:20.199
and the fear that you'll
end up just like them.

42:27.072 --> 42:28.107
I know she's gone.

42:30.376 --> 42:32.878
At least the sister I knew.

42:36.849 --> 42:38.250
Or maybe it is a demon.

42:38.317 --> 42:39.185
I don't know.

42:45.424 --> 42:46.660
Okay, I'm documenting this.

42:46.725 --> 42:49.195
Last night I took a pregnancy
test, it was positive.

42:49.261 --> 42:50.896
I know it sounds crazy,

42:50.963 --> 42:52.965
but I asked the board
a few questions.

42:53.032 --> 42:54.033
I pushed the thing myself,

42:54.099 --> 42:56.168
and I answered them myself.

42:56.235 --> 42:57.836
I asked it if I was
having a boy or a girl.

42:57.903 --> 42:59.905
It didn't answer, I put
it back in the wardrobe.

43:02.975 --> 43:04.743
I did not do this.

43:09.615 --> 43:12.818
Huh-huh, I got
you Captain Rogers!

43:14.887 --> 43:16.455
Okay, I got you!

43:16.522 --> 43:17.389
I got you!

43:18.524 --> 43:19.558
It's your turn.

43:38.645 --> 43:42.381
Abby, let's go to
your room to play.

43:43.616 --> 43:45.251
Mommy is upset.

43:47.019 --> 43:48.020
Catherine.

43:49.421 --> 43:51.156
It's time for bed.

43:52.958 --> 43:54.293
It's time for bed!

44:30.095 --> 44:32.031
Hey, not all at once!

44:42.207 --> 44:43.208
Who is girl?

44:47.946 --> 44:50.482
Uh, uh, uh, uh, not all at once.

44:52.484 --> 44:53.352
I know that.

44:54.486 --> 44:56.555
You know I know that.

44:56.622 --> 44:57.489
Shh.

44:59.024 --> 45:01.193
Will she get better?

45:01.260 --> 45:02.594
Please make her better.

45:03.595 --> 45:05.197
I wanna be better.

45:07.599 --> 45:08.467
Hello.

45:11.203 --> 45:15.374
Oh, I, I, I, I didn't
do anything wrong.

45:15.441 --> 45:17.576
I didn't do anything wrong!

45:17.644 --> 45:18.844
It's okay.

45:20.045 --> 45:21.213
I met you.

45:36.128 --> 45:38.163
Put on the full armor of God,

45:39.264 --> 45:41.066
so you can take your standing.

45:45.070 --> 45:46.004
It doesn't help

45:47.506 --> 45:49.007
when it's inside you.

45:53.078 --> 45:54.146
Coming for you.

45:58.517 --> 46:00.953
She wants me to hurt you.

46:02.321 --> 46:03.188
Who?

46:06.358 --> 46:07.627
I'll show you.

46:28.815 --> 46:30.683
Can you hear them yet?

46:31.684 --> 46:33.152
You're better off alone.

47:47.794 --> 47:49.729
How'd you sleep?

47:49.796 --> 47:50.529
I slept better.

47:52.130 --> 47:53.532
Sorry to interrupt last night.

47:55.534 --> 47:56.535
It gets worse at night.

47:58.136 --> 47:59.338
I really wish you'd
leave me alone at night.

47:59.404 --> 48:01.106
It's embarrassing.

48:01.173 --> 48:02.007
I'm sorry.

48:04.543 --> 48:06.578
I noticed you
cleaned everything.

48:06.646 --> 48:07.513
Busy morning.

48:08.547 --> 48:09.248
It's 4 p.m.

48:11.183 --> 48:12.652
You slept the day away, sis.

48:13.920 --> 48:15.387
Again?

48:15.454 --> 48:16.622
Lousy company I've been.

48:18.323 --> 48:21.193
I gotta finish
chopping this wood.

48:21.260 --> 48:23.161
Get some up to the
house, to the shed.

48:24.162 --> 48:25.097
Feed the chickens.

48:27.834 --> 48:30.335
Um, I got some steak
casserole in the fridge

48:30.402 --> 48:31.804
if you wanna get that cooking.

48:32.772 --> 48:33.640
Sure.

48:35.574 --> 48:38.277
Hey, did you pick
up the Spirit Board?

48:39.478 --> 48:41.648
If I did, it'd be
in the bookshelf.

48:41.714 --> 48:43.549
Yeah, I looked.

48:43.615 --> 48:44.483
It's not there.

48:46.251 --> 48:47.119
It'll turn up.

48:48.520 --> 48:50.489
Can you take a pile of
wood back to the house?

48:53.492 --> 48:55.227
Yeah, of course.

49:39.939 --> 49:40.807
Hello?

49:45.510 --> 49:48.380
Stop, stop it.

50:04.664 --> 50:07.399
Dear Lord, thank you for
this time with my sister.

50:07.466 --> 50:08.735
In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

50:08.801 --> 50:10.268
Amen.

50:20.545 --> 50:22.280
I couldn't find
the Spirit Board.

50:23.448 --> 50:24.316
It'll turn up.

50:27.654 --> 50:30.890
Do you believe
in, um,

50:30.957 --> 50:31.924
spirits?

50:32.925 --> 50:34.393
Not
since we were kids.

50:37.897 --> 50:40.432
I asked the board some
questions about my baby.

50:42.367 --> 50:44.804
It doesn't
work with just one person.

50:44.871 --> 50:47.239
I asked it if I was
having a boy or a girl.

50:49.441 --> 50:51.276
And when I went back,

50:51.343 --> 50:54.947
G-I-R-L was circled in
Crayon on the board.

50:58.483 --> 50:59.919
I was gonna show you last night,

50:59.986 --> 51:02.287
when you bumped into
me, I dropped the board.

51:03.890 --> 51:06.525
Well demons aren't real
and I don't have Crayons.

51:07.426 --> 51:08.360
It isn't funny.

51:10.029 --> 51:11.329
I know what I saw.

51:20.505 --> 51:21.373
I recorded it.

51:22.474 --> 51:23.643
What?

51:23.710 --> 51:26.344
I recorded it on my
camera, here I'll show you.

51:26.411 --> 51:27.379
What do you mean
you recorded it?

51:27.446 --> 51:28.547
- Just hold on.
- What do you mean

51:28.613 --> 51:29.749
you recorded it?

51:29.816 --> 51:30.582
- I said, hold on.
- What were you recording?

51:30.650 --> 51:31.751
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

51:33.086 --> 51:34.586
Are you recording me?

51:34.654 --> 51:36.689
How's your thesis coming?

51:36.756 --> 51:38.590
I asked you how your
thesis was coming?

51:38.658 --> 51:39.959
And were you recording me?

51:40.026 --> 51:41.560
- No.
- Were you using me

51:41.627 --> 51:42.762
as a lab rat?

51:42.829 --> 51:43.963
Did Jerry send you here?

51:46.999 --> 51:48.366
What did you do?

51:49.501 --> 51:50.670
I didn't mean to.

51:50.737 --> 51:51.704
I didn't mean to.

51:51.771 --> 51:53.039
You, you were acting
really strange

51:53.106 --> 51:54.140
and I didn't know what was
going on until you told me.

51:56.109 --> 51:58.243
I'll delete it, I'll
delete it, here, here.

51:59.846 --> 52:03.515
It was, it was, it
was, it was in here.

52:03.582 --> 52:06.485
I, I put it in here,
I put it in here.

52:06.551 --> 52:07.820
Like, this is where
I put the board too.

52:07.887 --> 52:09.989
It was, it was in here!

52:10.056 --> 52:11.724
I put it in here!

52:11.791 --> 52:15.661
You have to believe me,
I am not delusional!

52:22.534 --> 52:24.904
The closet, in the hallway.

52:24.971 --> 52:27.940
Maybe, maybe you put it in
there when you were cleaning up.

52:28.007 --> 52:31.543
Yeah, I heard something
in the hallway closet.

52:33.445 --> 52:34.647
It was locked.

52:34.714 --> 52:37.250
Something in the closet did it.

52:39.584 --> 52:42.789
In it, something's in it!

52:44.623 --> 52:46.025
Can we check it?

52:46.092 --> 52:46.959
Please.

52:49.996 --> 52:50.863
Cat?

52:52.564 --> 52:53.431
Please.

53:06.879 --> 53:09.314
There's a reason Dad
always kept it locked.

53:11.083 --> 53:11.951
So did I.

53:14.187 --> 53:16.722
You can look for your
game if you like.

53:22.628 --> 53:23.830
No, I'm fine.

53:30.136 --> 53:31.003
I'm fine.

54:40.806 --> 54:43.408
You're not allowed in there.

54:44.810 --> 54:47.813
Come on, don't
you wanna meet her?

55:02.028 --> 55:03.963
She wants to say hello.

55:21.180 --> 55:24.116
Don't you wanna
meet your daughter?

55:25.051 --> 55:26.786
Don't you want to meet me

55:26.852 --> 55:28.553
before you kill me?

55:37.129 --> 55:39.098
Don't you wanna
meet your daughter?

55:40.299 --> 55:42.635
Don't you wanna meet me?

55:48.975 --> 55:51.110
You're better off alone.

55:55.314 --> 55:56.182
Hello.

55:58.150 --> 55:59.018
Hello.

56:39.925 --> 56:42.628
(wood cracking

56:47.233 --> 56:49.601
How'd you sleep?

56:49.668 --> 56:50.535
Good.

56:52.304 --> 56:54.306
I think I'm getting
a little cabin fever.

56:59.078 --> 57:00.146
Squeeze.

57:04.950 --> 57:06.618
I was close.

57:06.685 --> 57:07.286
Here.

57:10.823 --> 57:11.690
Feel my hand.

57:14.693 --> 57:15.995
Squeeze.

57:18.697 --> 57:20.099
- Got it?
- Mm-hmm.

57:42.721 --> 57:43.588
Try again.

57:50.996 --> 57:52.331
Squeeze.

57:56.502 --> 57:59.038
How do you shoot things
when they're moving?

57:59.105 --> 58:01.907
Deer are typically
bigger than cans of beans.

58:04.276 --> 58:07.179
Come on, I gotta
finish up the wood.

58:07.246 --> 58:09.281
Get some in the
house, to the shed.

58:10.116 --> 58:11.016
Feed the chickens.

58:13.185 --> 58:14.353
Now, there's some liver
steaks in the fridge

58:14.420 --> 58:15.821
if you wanna get those cooking.

58:15.888 --> 58:16.755
Sure.

58:17.823 --> 58:19.692
Do you want me to
put the gun away?

58:22.027 --> 58:23.262
The key's over the door.

58:44.316 --> 58:45.851
What are you doing?

58:50.456 --> 58:51.790
They're burnt.

58:55.261 --> 58:58.430
Please let this food nourish
us and keep us strong.

58:58.497 --> 59:00.866
Thank you Lord for
not letting my sister

59:00.933 --> 59:02.401
burn the house down.

59:02.468 --> 59:03.502
In Jesus' name we pray.

59:03.569 --> 59:05.271
- Amen.
- Amen.

59:55.854 --> 59:59.325
This is so weird.

1:00:00.292 --> 1:00:01.927
Why?

1:00:01.994 --> 1:00:03.862
I just can't
believe you found this

1:00:03.929 --> 1:00:05.064
after all these years.

1:00:06.899 --> 1:00:08.367
I feel like a kid again.

1:00:09.935 --> 1:00:10.803
In a good way.

1:00:12.905 --> 1:00:14.139
Old things are good.

1:00:25.284 --> 1:00:26.885
I'm hearing things, Cat.

1:00:29.922 --> 1:00:31.323
The house creaks, Grace.

1:00:34.226 --> 1:00:35.894
And I probably moved your game.

1:00:38.097 --> 1:00:39.298
Sometimes I lose things.

1:00:40.232 --> 1:00:41.166
I don't remember moving them,

1:00:41.233 --> 1:00:42.434
but they turn up.

1:00:44.903 --> 1:00:46.905
Do you think I would
be a good mother?

1:00:51.910 --> 1:00:53.245
You are going to
be a good mother.

1:00:53.312 --> 1:00:54.780
No, I mean,

1:00:57.283 --> 1:00:59.051
could I raise a child?

1:01:00.152 --> 1:01:02.054
What are you saying to me?

1:01:02.121 --> 1:01:03.455
I've just been thinking.

1:01:05.659 --> 1:01:07.326
If I'm hearing things,

1:01:09.128 --> 1:01:10.195
what happened to Mom.

1:01:13.599 --> 1:01:15.100
If it happens to me too.

1:01:19.138 --> 1:01:20.873
Maybe I shouldn't have the baby.

1:01:24.109 --> 1:01:25.477
I still feel her sometimes.

1:01:27.980 --> 1:01:29.381
She writes me letters.

1:01:31.950 --> 1:01:34.887
I can't always get
them out, though,

1:01:34.953 --> 1:01:39.958
so she just, she just
reads them aloud sometimes.

1:01:42.094 --> 1:01:44.163
But the atoms are always there,

1:01:44.229 --> 1:01:45.931
the genomes, really.

1:01:47.599 --> 1:01:49.101
You can't give her away.

1:01:54.273 --> 1:01:55.107
Catherine.

1:01:57.109 --> 1:01:58.243
I am a good mother.

1:02:00.245 --> 1:02:01.380
Why would you say that?

1:02:02.514 --> 1:02:03.916
What is wrong with you?

1:02:05.417 --> 1:02:07.953
You think I'm a bad mother?

1:02:08.020 --> 1:02:11.290
You think I can't
raise my own daughter?

1:02:12.391 --> 1:02:14.059
I am a good mother.

1:02:16.995 --> 1:02:17.863
I know.

1:02:18.564 --> 1:02:20.499
I know, I know you are.

1:04:22.254 --> 1:04:22.922
You're fine.

1:04:25.224 --> 1:04:26.458
You're not hearing things.

1:04:30.763 --> 1:04:31.997
She's your sister.

1:04:35.835 --> 1:04:36.703
She needs you.

1:04:52.685 --> 1:04:55.354
Can
Penny come out and play?

1:04:55.420 --> 1:04:57.322
Mommy isn't feeling well.

1:05:07.299 --> 1:05:08.333
Hello.

1:05:10.602 --> 1:05:11.738
You're fine.

1:05:13.605 --> 1:05:14.606
You're fine.

1:05:56.348 --> 1:05:57.349
Little girl?

1:06:00.954 --> 1:06:01.754
Abby?

1:06:23.575 --> 1:06:24.543
I hear you.

1:06:44.931 --> 1:06:46.598
You're fine, Grace.

1:06:47.599 --> 1:06:48.433
You're fine.

1:07:07.854 --> 1:07:08.721
Push.

1:07:18.765 --> 1:07:21.400
You're better off alone.

1:07:40.887 --> 1:07:43.321
Mommy's not feeling well.

1:07:45.858 --> 1:07:47.794
I didn't do anything wrong.

1:07:47.860 --> 1:07:49.996
I didn't do anything wrong.

1:07:50.063 --> 1:07:52.364
I didn't do anything wrong.

1:07:52.431 --> 1:07:54.266
I didn't do anything wrong.

1:10:10.535 --> 1:10:12.404
What are you doing?

1:10:12.470 --> 1:10:13.973
I didn't sleep well.

1:10:15.708 --> 1:10:17.409
I chopped the wood.

1:10:17.475 --> 1:10:19.045
- I was gonna feed the...
- I'll feed the chickens.

1:10:36.262 --> 1:10:37.997
I want you to leave.

1:10:38.064 --> 1:10:38.731
What?

1:10:39.932 --> 1:10:41.767
I want you to leave now.

1:10:41.834 --> 1:10:44.136
Please, Cat.

1:10:44.203 --> 1:10:46.706
Just relax, just calm down.

1:10:46.772 --> 1:10:47.974
You're making it worse.

1:10:49.208 --> 1:10:50.910
I need you to leave, get out.

1:10:52.611 --> 1:10:53.545
- I can't.
- Just get out,

1:10:53.612 --> 1:10:54.613
get out, get out!

1:10:57.783 --> 1:10:59.652
Cat, help me, please.

1:11:01.519 --> 1:11:03.622
- Stop trying to trick me.
- I'm not.

1:11:03.689 --> 1:11:04.991
Stop.

1:11:05.057 --> 1:11:06.125
Stop!

1:11:06.192 --> 1:11:07.760
- Stop!
- I'm not, Catherine.

1:11:07.827 --> 1:11:10.630
He won't leave me alone.

1:11:10.696 --> 1:11:13.199
Stop trying to trick me.

1:11:13.266 --> 1:11:14.599
Did he send you here?

1:11:14.667 --> 1:11:15.400
No.

1:11:15.467 --> 1:11:19.071
Did Jerry, no I need you,

1:11:20.206 --> 1:11:21.674
you can't be here,
you can't be here!

1:11:21.741 --> 1:11:24.010
Catherine, it's
happening to me.

1:11:24.076 --> 1:11:25.543
No, no, you're fine.

1:11:25.610 --> 1:11:27.146
- I'm not fine.
- Yes, you are.

1:11:27.213 --> 1:11:29.015
I'm hearing things
all through the night.

1:11:29.081 --> 1:11:29.715
It's the house!

1:11:29.782 --> 1:11:30.816
It's not the house!

1:11:30.883 --> 1:11:34.486
Stop telling me it's
the fucking house!

1:11:42.962 --> 1:11:44.797
I can see her.

1:11:47.099 --> 1:11:48.834
She's in my dreams.

1:11:49.969 --> 1:11:52.905
But when I wake up,
she's still there.

1:11:55.241 --> 1:11:56.676
She's in my room.

1:11:58.844 --> 1:12:00.913
I followed her last
night down the hall

1:12:00.980 --> 1:12:02.748
and into the office.

1:12:02.815 --> 1:12:03.950
She disappeared.

1:12:05.851 --> 1:12:06.719
Who?

1:12:17.630 --> 1:12:18.496
A little girl.

1:12:21.367 --> 1:12:22.234
My daughter.

1:12:27.273 --> 1:12:29.075
I can see her.

1:12:29.141 --> 1:12:31.509
As clear as I'm seeing you.

1:12:34.747 --> 1:12:36.682
I drowned her last night.

1:12:39.617 --> 1:12:40.518
You helped me.

1:12:44.023 --> 1:12:45.091
You helped me.

1:12:45.157 --> 1:12:46.292
You, you,

1:12:46.359 --> 1:12:49.195
- you, you helped me.
- No, no.

1:12:49.261 --> 1:12:50.830
- You did it, you killed her!
- No.

1:12:50.896 --> 1:12:51.764
No!

1:13:09.648 --> 1:13:11.784
What you're going through,

1:13:12.685 --> 1:13:14.086
that's how it started with me.

1:13:17.923 --> 1:13:20.026
Quetiapine will help you
with the hallucinations.

1:13:20.092 --> 1:13:21.861
With what you're hearing.

1:13:21.927 --> 1:13:23.662
This will help with the
anxiety and paranoia,

1:13:23.729 --> 1:13:25.297
and this will
settle your stomach.

1:13:26.332 --> 1:13:27.333
I'm scared, Catherine.

1:13:30.102 --> 1:13:32.204
When you get home,
get started on these.

1:13:33.806 --> 1:13:34.673
And see a doctor.

1:13:35.841 --> 1:13:36.675
I don't want this.

1:13:40.813 --> 1:13:42.014
When they come for you,

1:13:42.915 --> 1:13:44.650
it's best to hide the headaches.

1:14:04.970 --> 1:14:06.272
And when you have your baby,

1:14:10.109 --> 1:14:11.277
they'll take it from you.

1:14:14.180 --> 1:14:15.047
What do I do?

1:14:18.184 --> 1:14:19.852
You're making it worse, Grace.

1:14:22.088 --> 1:14:23.155
Get some rest tonight.

1:14:24.790 --> 1:14:26.192
Tomorrow, I need you to leave.

1:15:26.051 --> 1:15:27.786
Please forgive me.

1:15:41.800 --> 1:15:43.869
Our Father, who art in heaven,

1:15:44.970 --> 1:15:46.205
hallowed be thy name.

1:15:47.339 --> 1:15:48.307
Thy kingdom come,

1:15:48.374 --> 1:15:50.142
thy will be done,

1:15:50.209 --> 1:15:53.012
on earth as it is in heaven.

1:15:54.079 --> 1:15:57.283
Give us this day
our daily bread.

1:15:57.349 --> 1:16:02.354
- And...
- What are you doing?

1:16:03.322 --> 1:16:07.760
And forgive us our trespasses,

1:16:08.460 --> 1:16:09.261
As we forgive

1:16:09.328 --> 1:16:11.897
those who trespass against us.

1:16:11.964 --> 1:16:13.098
Why are you praying?

1:16:13.966 --> 1:16:15.301
You're not real.

1:16:15.367 --> 1:16:17.970
I'm real, Penny's not real.

1:16:18.037 --> 1:16:19.004
Am I your mommy?

1:16:19.071 --> 1:16:21.340
Mommy's
not feeling well.

1:16:21.407 --> 1:16:22.308
You wanna play?

1:16:23.509 --> 1:16:24.510
Okay.

1:16:24.577 --> 1:16:26.378
Good, I'll hide first.

1:16:27.846 --> 1:16:31.150
But be quiet, Mom doesn't
want you to see me.

1:16:31.217 --> 1:16:31.951
Okay.

1:16:32.017 --> 1:16:34.753
Count to 20, no peeking.

1:16:38.224 --> 1:16:39.091
One.

1:16:40.125 --> 1:16:40.960
Two.

1:16:42.261 --> 1:16:43.128
Three.

1:17:19.932 --> 1:17:20.866
It's not real.

1:17:25.137 --> 1:17:26.038
None of it's real.

1:18:15.220 --> 1:18:17.122
Mommy isn't
feeling well, Abby.

1:18:31.970 --> 1:18:32.838
Hello?

1:18:46.552 --> 1:18:47.419
Hello?

1:18:51.190 --> 1:18:52.057
Little girl?

1:19:13.512 --> 1:19:14.480
Keep it down!

1:19:14.546 --> 1:19:16.014
I fell.

1:19:16.081 --> 1:19:17.950
Mommy
isn't feeling well.

1:19:18.016 --> 1:19:19.218
I'm sorry, Mommy.

1:19:21.353 --> 1:19:22.588
You made Mommy really mad.

1:19:51.216 --> 1:19:53.585
You cheated, lights
have to be off to play.

1:20:03.562 --> 1:20:07.032
You found me.

1:20:09.736 --> 1:20:10.602
Your turn.

1:20:11.937 --> 1:20:13.038
Can we rest for
minute before we play again?

1:20:13.105 --> 1:20:16.942
You're kidding, you've
been resting forever.

1:20:25.317 --> 1:20:26.485
You like to play, huh?

1:20:26.552 --> 1:20:27.419
Yeah.

1:20:33.492 --> 1:20:34.794
Is hide and seek
your favorite game?

1:20:34.861 --> 1:20:36.796
Mm, yeah.

1:20:41.366 --> 1:20:42.769
Who plays with you?

1:20:42.836 --> 1:20:44.970
Um, Mom, Penny.

1:20:45.672 --> 1:20:46.639
Penny, mostly.

1:20:50.108 --> 1:20:51.310
What's your name?

1:20:51.376 --> 1:20:52.211
Abby.

1:20:54.480 --> 1:20:56.181
Is Catherine your mom?

1:20:56.248 --> 1:20:57.082
Yeah.

1:21:01.286 --> 1:21:02.655
Why are you crying?

1:21:06.124 --> 1:21:07.292
Abby, I'm your aunt.

1:21:09.662 --> 1:21:11.263
I'm your Aunt Grace.

1:21:12.397 --> 1:21:16.268
It means, I'm your
mommy's sister.

1:21:16.335 --> 1:21:18.136
We were little girls together.

1:21:18.203 --> 1:21:19.639
Did you play hide and seek?

1:21:19.706 --> 1:21:20.773
Yeah.

1:21:20.840 --> 1:21:24.343
Really, because your
kind of bad at it.

1:21:24.409 --> 1:21:27.346
Well I
found you, didn't I?

1:21:27.412 --> 1:21:28.280
Yeah.

1:21:32.417 --> 1:21:34.453
Does anyone else find you?

1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:37.724
No, but I can
only play inside.

1:21:39.258 --> 1:21:41.527
This is boring, can we play
hide and seek some more?

1:21:43.495 --> 1:21:44.631
I don't know if you're
a good enough hider

1:21:44.697 --> 1:21:46.131
to play with me.

1:21:46.198 --> 1:21:47.099
I am.

1:21:50.904 --> 1:21:53.205
Do you wanna hide from Mom?

1:22:03.415 --> 1:22:04.851
I'm not allowed to go outside.

1:22:04.918 --> 1:22:05.652
That's what's gonna make this

1:22:05.718 --> 1:22:08.253
the best hiding spot ever.

1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:09.354
Come on.

1:22:24.737 --> 1:22:27.172
Abby?

1:22:27.239 --> 1:22:29.541
Abby, the best hiding
spot is across the bridge.

1:22:29.608 --> 1:22:30.576
I promise.

1:22:30.643 --> 1:22:32.611
Mommy says the
bridge isn't safe.

1:22:32.679 --> 1:22:34.246
I am right here with you.

1:22:34.313 --> 1:22:35.447
I'll protect you, okay?

1:22:37.316 --> 1:22:40.053
It's gonna be the best hiding
spot in the whole world.

1:22:40.887 --> 1:22:42.087
Will you try for me?

1:22:44.456 --> 1:22:45.357
Okay, come on.

1:22:46.558 --> 1:22:48.193
Abby!

1:22:48.260 --> 1:22:49.194
It's okay,
we're almost there.

1:22:49.261 --> 1:22:50.697
- No!
- No, come on, it's okay.

1:22:50.763 --> 1:22:52.331
No, it's okay.

1:22:55.868 --> 1:22:58.303
Abby, you get
back here right now!

1:22:58.370 --> 1:22:59.839
Catherine, what are you doing?

1:22:59.906 --> 1:23:01.674
What are you doing, Cat, Cat?

1:23:01.741 --> 1:23:03.743
Please, listen to me.

1:23:03.810 --> 1:23:04.677
It's me.

1:23:06.679 --> 1:23:09.314
Let her go.

1:23:09.381 --> 1:23:10.850
Mommy!

1:23:10.917 --> 1:23:11.851
Come here.

1:23:11.918 --> 1:23:13.720
- Help!
- David!

1:23:13.786 --> 1:23:15.755
- Mommy!
- David!

1:23:17.890 --> 1:23:19.391
- Jerry!
- David!

1:23:19.458 --> 1:23:20.325
Jerry!

1:23:21.426 --> 1:23:22.294
Jerry!

1:23:23.362 --> 1:23:24.864
- David!
- Grace.

1:23:24.931 --> 1:23:27.299
Get away from her, Jerry!

1:23:28.701 --> 1:23:29.769
David, help us, please!

1:23:29.836 --> 1:23:30.870
Go, go!

1:23:30.937 --> 1:23:32.371
- Jerry!
- No, Cat.

1:23:32.437 --> 1:23:33.873
- It's okay, sweetie.
- No, you're not

1:23:33.940 --> 1:23:35.742
taking here from me.

1:23:35.808 --> 1:23:36.608
No.

1:23:37.944 --> 1:23:38.811
No.

1:23:41.413 --> 1:23:43.983
You get in that
house right now!

1:23:44.050 --> 1:23:45.550
I said, go!

1:23:45.617 --> 1:23:47.887
- Catherine, no.
- You are not taking her

1:23:47.954 --> 1:23:49.221
from me!

1:24:29.461 --> 1:24:32.397
Abby, you come here right now!

1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:42.742
Abby, you open this
door this instant!

1:24:44.110 --> 1:24:46.411
You are in big trouble!

1:24:46.478 --> 1:24:48.413
- Mommy, stop!
- Mommy said

1:24:48.480 --> 1:24:49.916
not to leave the house.

1:24:49.982 --> 1:24:52.384
Mommy said outside
was dangerous.

1:24:52.451 --> 1:24:54.352
You're working with your
father again, aren't you?

1:24:54.419 --> 1:24:55.688
He's back again, isn't he?

1:24:55.755 --> 1:24:56.856
Isn't he?

1:24:59.591 --> 1:25:01.794
Grace is a very bad woman, Abby.

1:25:01.861 --> 1:25:03.495
Come back to Mommy.

1:25:07.599 --> 1:25:10.803
Abby, Abby, you get
out here this instant!

1:25:10.870 --> 1:25:12.038
No, no.

1:25:12.105 --> 1:25:13.572
Mommy, please.

1:25:13.639 --> 1:25:16.008
You are not taking
her from me, Jerry.

1:25:16.075 --> 1:25:18.978
You're a liar coming
for her destiny.

1:25:19.045 --> 1:25:21.446
Split between us, don't let her.

1:25:21.513 --> 1:25:22.715
Mommy, stop.

1:25:22.782 --> 1:25:24.549
You're scaring me.

1:25:30.990 --> 1:25:33.391
Mommy would never
hurt you, Abby.

1:25:37.630 --> 1:25:41.333
I would never let
them hurt you, baby.

1:25:41.399 --> 1:25:44.837
I just wanted to keep you
safe from that mean woman.

1:25:44.904 --> 1:25:46.139
I'm sorry, Mommy.

1:25:46.205 --> 1:25:50.710
It's just I really wanted
to play with Aunt Grace.

1:25:53.112 --> 1:25:56.381
Why did you play with her?

1:25:56.448 --> 1:25:59.584
You know I'm always
here to play.

1:25:59.652 --> 1:26:02.722
I know, Penny, it's just that

1:26:02.789 --> 1:26:04.090
Mommy wasn't feeling well,

1:26:04.157 --> 1:26:06.025
and I wanted
someone to play with

1:26:06.092 --> 1:26:10.963
so I gave her clues but
she couldn't find me.

1:26:13.199 --> 1:26:14.066
What clues?

1:26:15.101 --> 1:26:17.569
Honey, did you take
the Spirit Board?

1:26:19.538 --> 1:26:20.605
Yeah.

1:26:23.575 --> 1:26:25.845
Did you circle G-I-R-L?

1:26:25.912 --> 1:26:27.479
No, Mommy, Penny did.

1:26:27.546 --> 1:26:28.413
Remember?

1:26:30.783 --> 1:26:31.651
Uh.

1:26:32.617 --> 1:26:33.886
I took her camera.

1:26:35.453 --> 1:26:36.989
Where is it, honey?

1:26:38.523 --> 1:26:40.525
She made a video
saying that you're crazy

1:26:40.592 --> 1:26:41.928
so I took it from her.

1:26:45.998 --> 1:26:47.432
You stay here.

1:26:47.499 --> 1:26:48.366
Why?

1:26:49.635 --> 1:26:52.404
I have to give Aunt Grace
her camera back, okay?

1:27:39.752 --> 1:27:40.786
Let me out!

1:27:41.687 --> 1:27:42.554
Cat!

1:27:45.091 --> 1:27:46.025
Let me out!

1:28:27.700 --> 1:28:30.169
I'm afraid my sister could
be dangerous to herself.

1:28:32.004 --> 1:28:33.605
She catches herself
from time to time

1:28:33.673 --> 1:28:35.041
when her sentences
aren't making any sense.

1:28:35.107 --> 1:28:36.108
She's jumbled.

1:28:37.475 --> 1:28:41.647
When she does this, she's
usually able to catch herself.

1:28:42.782 --> 1:28:45.051
It's as if she doesn't
know what she's said,

1:28:45.117 --> 1:28:46.085
but from my expression,

1:28:46.152 --> 1:28:47.853
she knows she isn't
making any sense.

1:28:50.323 --> 1:28:52.524
Cat, let me out!

1:28:52.590 --> 1:28:56.862
I went into psych because
of the loss of my mother.

1:29:00.099 --> 1:29:03.669
Which eventually led to the
failing health of my father.

1:29:03.736 --> 1:29:05.004
It effected him the worst.

1:29:07.139 --> 1:29:10.776
He'd spend every moment he
could away at the family cabin,

1:29:10.843 --> 1:29:11.978
leaving me with Catherine.

1:29:13.145 --> 1:29:15.982
Sometimes at home,
sometimes at the cabin.

1:29:16.048 --> 1:29:17.482
But he was always absent.

1:29:19.785 --> 1:29:20.953
She inherited me,

1:29:22.620 --> 1:29:23.789
the cabin, Mom.

1:29:25.291 --> 1:29:26.826
She inherited Mom.

1:29:26.892 --> 1:29:28.995
Cat, let me out of here!

1:29:29.061 --> 1:29:32.264
But I was young, I wanted
to further understand it.

1:29:34.100 --> 1:29:36.135
I just never thought I would

1:29:37.036 --> 1:29:38.503
understand it on this level.

1:29:39.604 --> 1:29:41.674
I never thought that
I would be watching

1:29:41.741 --> 1:29:43.709
the decay of my sister's mind.

1:29:43.776 --> 1:29:46.278
I never thought I would be
questioning my own sanity.

1:29:49.648 --> 1:29:53.986
I know she is or is going crazy.

1:30:03.062 --> 1:30:06.332
I just hope I'm not joining her.

1:30:43.469 --> 1:30:45.171
Everything is going to be okay.

1:30:46.105 --> 1:30:48.641
Cat, you don't have to do this.

1:30:48.707 --> 1:30:50.575
Please, you don't know
what you're doing.

1:30:52.978 --> 1:30:54.380
Aunt Grace?

1:30:54.447 --> 1:30:55.281
Yes?

1:30:57.283 --> 1:30:58.717
Why did Mom hit you?

1:31:00.119 --> 1:31:01.954
Your Mom is very sick, Abby.

1:31:02.021 --> 1:31:03.155
She needs our help.

1:31:04.256 --> 1:31:07.326
You aren't trying
to hurt her, are you?

1:31:07.393 --> 1:31:11.030
Mommy says other people on
the outside wanna hurt us.

1:31:11.097 --> 1:31:12.765
No, no, sweetheart.

1:31:13.466 --> 1:31:15.734
I love your mom very much.

1:31:16.435 --> 1:31:17.602
Can you help her?

1:31:19.738 --> 1:31:22.141
Can you, can you get that key?

1:31:33.385 --> 1:31:34.253
Good job.

1:31:35.888 --> 1:31:38.324
Give it to me, yeah, it's okay.

1:31:41.794 --> 1:31:43.028
Good job, okay.

1:31:45.264 --> 1:31:48.000
Just give me the
key, okay, thank you.

1:31:50.035 --> 1:31:51.170
Okay, come on!

1:31:52.271 --> 1:31:53.372
Wait right here.

1:31:56.208 --> 1:31:58.277
Okay, which way is the farm?

1:31:59.278 --> 1:32:00.379
Okay, come on.

1:32:07.953 --> 1:32:08.988
Abby?

1:32:09.054 --> 1:32:11.023
- Stop!
- Come on, Abby.

1:32:13.325 --> 1:32:14.193
Abby!

1:32:15.327 --> 1:32:16.729
- Mom, help!
- Shh.

1:32:16.795 --> 1:32:17.663
Abby!

1:32:18.764 --> 1:32:19.732
Listen, I am trying
to help you, okay?

1:32:19.798 --> 1:32:21.033
You just don't
realize it right now.

1:32:21.100 --> 1:32:23.302
Please, you're mommy needs
you to be strong, okay?

1:32:23.369 --> 1:32:24.970
Okay, come on.

1:32:25.037 --> 1:32:26.872
- It's okay.
- Abby!

1:32:26.939 --> 1:32:28.107
Abby!

1:32:28.174 --> 1:32:29.308
Mommy, help!

1:32:31.076 --> 1:32:33.179
You're not taking my daughter.

1:32:33.245 --> 1:32:35.047
You're not well, Catherine.

1:32:35.114 --> 1:32:36.148
Now come on, Abby.

1:32:36.215 --> 1:32:37.783
Come on, honey, come to mommy.

1:32:37.850 --> 1:32:38.817
Don't go.

1:32:39.985 --> 1:32:40.853
Look, Abby.

1:32:42.021 --> 1:32:43.155
Abby, stop playing with
that terrible woman

1:32:43.222 --> 1:32:45.157
- and come to mommy!
- Why, so you can shoot me?

1:32:45.224 --> 1:32:46.792
I'd never hurt you, Abby.

1:32:46.859 --> 1:32:48.160
So you can keep
her locked away

1:32:48.227 --> 1:32:50.062
until you completely
lose your mind

1:32:50.129 --> 1:32:51.297
and start seeing her as someone

1:32:51.363 --> 1:32:52.164
other than your own daughter?

1:32:52.231 --> 1:32:53.799
No, I would always know her.

1:32:53.866 --> 1:32:55.100
Give her a chance, Cat.

1:32:56.969 --> 1:32:58.304
Protect her.

1:32:58.370 --> 1:32:59.205
Catherine.

1:33:01.040 --> 1:33:02.942
She needs to get
out of this house.

1:33:03.008 --> 1:33:05.277
She needs to play
with other kids.

1:33:06.412 --> 1:33:08.314
Give her a chance
at a normal life.

1:33:10.316 --> 1:33:12.218
Like you gave me.

1:33:14.320 --> 1:33:15.788
What if she gets sick, Cat?

1:33:17.556 --> 1:33:18.424
Like Mom.

1:33:20.893 --> 1:33:21.560
Like you.

1:33:24.263 --> 1:33:25.731
The chickens in the shed.

1:33:27.233 --> 1:33:28.968
What's in the shed, Catherine?

1:33:30.936 --> 1:33:33.072
Chickens are in the shed.

1:33:33.138 --> 1:33:34.273
You're not well, Cat.

1:33:35.541 --> 1:33:38.143
It's
just silly chickens.

1:33:40.079 --> 1:33:41.280
Where's Jerry?

1:33:41.347 --> 1:33:43.315
- I don't know.
- Where

1:33:43.382 --> 1:33:45.484
is Abby's father?

1:33:45.551 --> 1:33:46.552
He was watching me!

1:33:46.619 --> 1:33:48.887
He came here to
let you say goodbye.

1:33:48.954 --> 1:33:50.089
He did exactly what you wanted.

1:33:50.155 --> 1:33:50.990
Where is Jerry?

1:33:51.056 --> 1:33:52.124
- I don't know.
- Where is he?

1:33:52.191 --> 1:33:54.760
He's a bad man who
tried to take our Abby.

1:33:56.095 --> 1:33:57.796
Abby's been in the shed.

1:34:00.299 --> 1:34:02.334
You killed Jerry.

1:34:04.003 --> 1:34:06.372
I am a good mother.

1:34:06.438 --> 1:34:09.842
There are no
chickens in the shed.

1:34:09.908 --> 1:34:10.876
You.

1:34:10.943 --> 1:34:12.278
Just Abby's father.

1:34:12.344 --> 1:34:15.581
You are not
taking her from me!
