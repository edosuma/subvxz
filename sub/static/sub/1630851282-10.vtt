00:10.379 --> 00:12.379
- I love hanging out together.

00:12.448 --> 00:15.965
- This is quality friend time.

00:16.034 --> 00:17.137
What are you watching?

00:17.206 --> 00:19.413
- Oh,
"The Great Alien Bake Off."

00:19.482 --> 00:22.310
- Come on.
That show is so fake.

00:22.379 --> 00:23.793
Aliens don't exist.

00:23.862 --> 00:26.620
Even if they did, they wouldn't
be baking cupcakes.

00:26.689 --> 00:28.137
- How can I be best friends
with someone

00:28.206 --> 00:31.896
who doesn't believe in aliens,
ghosts, or bigfoots?

00:31.965 --> 00:35.965
Or is it bigfeets?

00:36.034 --> 00:37.413
- Presley, give me

00:37.482 --> 00:39.137
the credit card Dad left you
so I can order lunch.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.724
- Uh, Mom and Dad made me your
babysitter for the weekend,

00:41.793 --> 00:43.620
so you don't get
that credit card.

00:43.689 --> 00:45.931
Besides, there's plenty of
burnt popcorn in the microwave

00:46.000 --> 00:48.379
from when I made breakfast.

00:48.448 --> 00:50.620
- Come on.
I don't need a babysitter.

00:50.689 --> 00:52.172
I built a home security system.

00:52.241 --> 00:54.310
- What is he talking about?

00:54.379 --> 00:56.586
- Fisher says he has nets
all over the house.

00:56.655 --> 00:58.379
- I do.

00:58.448 --> 01:00.068
I can drop a net
from any ceiling at any time

01:00.137 --> 01:02.068
with laser precision.

01:02.137 --> 01:04.206
- Ooh, don't drop a net on me.

01:04.275 --> 01:07.379
[remote chimes]
[screams]

01:07.448 --> 01:11.862
Wow, those nets are
actually real.

01:11.931 --> 01:14.137
- You meant for that to land
on her, didn't you?

01:14.206 --> 01:17.551
- You don't know that.

01:17.620 --> 01:19.034
- Coming in with froyo.

01:19.103 --> 01:20.448
- Where did you get that?

01:20.517 --> 01:22.103
- FroYo Yo-Yo.

01:22.172 --> 01:24.206
- You can't go to FroYo Yo-Yo.

01:24.275 --> 01:26.448
- Yeah, that's the new store
competing with the MicroMooery.

01:26.517 --> 01:27.758
- The MicroMooery which we love

01:27.827 --> 01:29.448
and is owned
by our friend Spenders.

01:29.517 --> 01:33.241
- But in every froyo,
there's a yo-yo.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.620
Hey, Fisher.

01:34.689 --> 01:37.241
You want the rest of this?
It's got a yo-yo.

01:37.310 --> 01:39.275
- Yo-yos are for babies.

01:39.344 --> 01:41.241
But I guess
I could take it upstairs

01:41.310 --> 01:45.000
and throw it away for you.

01:45.068 --> 01:48.551
Whoo-hoo!
I got a yo-yo!

01:48.620 --> 01:49.689
- If Spenders found out

01:49.758 --> 01:51.310
that you were supporting
the competition,

01:51.379 --> 01:52.413
he'd be devastated.

01:52.482 --> 01:54.068
- Relax.
How would he even know?

01:54.137 --> 01:55.551
[notification chimes]

01:55.620 --> 01:56.689
- Oh, it's Spenders.

01:56.758 --> 01:59.344
- He knows!

01:59.413 --> 02:02.275
- Munchy, it's not a call,
it's a KidDING.

02:02.344 --> 02:03.793
Spenders wants to hire us.

02:03.862 --> 02:05.655
- Let's call him
and see what the job is.

02:05.724 --> 02:07.172
- Oh.

02:07.241 --> 02:11.103
We could ask him here
where we have no milkshakes...

02:11.172 --> 02:16.551
or we could ask him here
where we do have milkshakes.

02:16.620 --> 02:18.862
- Ask who?
What are you talking about?

02:18.931 --> 02:21.275
- Remember earlier
in the basement?

02:21.344 --> 02:22.724
I said we could ask
Spenders here

02:22.793 --> 02:25.689
where we have no milkshakes
and then trailed off?

02:25.758 --> 02:30.034
- I don't remember.
You trail off a lot.

02:30.103 --> 02:34.379
- Anyone else see a creepy
painting floating toward us?

02:34.448 --> 02:36.068
- Hey, guys,
look what I found upstairs.

02:36.137 --> 02:38.862
- Oh, good.
Someone painted a nightmare.

02:38.931 --> 02:41.000
- That's my
great-great-grandfather.

02:41.068 --> 02:42.689
- A fun nightmare

02:42.758 --> 02:46.344
about non-terrifying
grandfathers.

02:46.413 --> 02:48.793
- [whispers]
Nice save.

02:48.862 --> 02:51.655
- This is
Colonel Orville Moostache.

02:51.724 --> 02:53.206
He built this place
100 years ago.

02:53.275 --> 02:54.379
- I know about this guy.

02:54.448 --> 02:55.724
He used to live
above the Mooery.

02:55.793 --> 02:56.931
- Yep.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.241
That's where me and my folks
live now.

02:58.310 --> 02:59.551
- They say one night,
he went out to milk a cow

02:59.620 --> 03:01.413
and mysteriously vanished.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.793
And on cold nights,

03:02.862 --> 03:05.586
you can still hear the rattling
of his milk pail.

03:05.655 --> 03:07.586
- Ooh, this place has a ghost?

03:07.655 --> 03:09.344
Ghosts rattle things.

03:09.413 --> 03:12.137
- So do babies.

03:12.206 --> 03:13.793
What did you KidDING us for?

03:13.862 --> 03:16.793
- I want to hire you to get
to the bottom of a mystery.

03:16.862 --> 03:19.413
- You want us to be detectives?
That's perfect!

03:19.482 --> 03:22.241
I can look for clues using
my new multi-tool phone case.

03:22.310 --> 03:24.655
Check out
this magnifying glass.

03:26.758 --> 03:28.482
- So what's the mystery,
Spenders?

03:28.551 --> 03:29.896
- It's weird.

03:29.965 --> 03:31.896
So I get up early
to milk Cash the cow.

03:31.965 --> 03:34.275
But for the past few days
when I've gone down there,

03:34.344 --> 03:35.758
Cash has already been milked.

03:35.827 --> 03:38.068
- [gasps]
You're being night-milked!

03:38.137 --> 03:39.379
- Yes!

03:39.448 --> 03:40.965
And whoever's doing it
just leaves the milk out

03:41.034 --> 03:42.379
and it spoils.

03:42.448 --> 03:44.275
I only have enough reserves
for a few more days.

03:44.344 --> 03:46.586
- So you won't be able to make
ice cream, whipped cream,

03:46.655 --> 03:48.482
or my surprising favorite,
sour cream?

03:48.551 --> 03:49.655
- That's right.

03:49.724 --> 03:52.931
And I agree.
That's surprising.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.931
We're already losing business
to FroYo Yo-Yo

03:55.000 --> 03:57.931
and if we run out of milk,
I don't know what we'll do.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.103
- Who would do something
as despicable as night-milking?

04:03.413 --> 04:06.103
- Hello, Spenders.
[cow moos]

04:06.172 --> 04:09.310
- Oh, hello, Buckles.
How can I help you?

04:09.379 --> 04:12.758
- Well, my store, FroYo Yo-Yo
is so full of customers

04:12.827 --> 04:16.896
that I decided to come here
for some quiet.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.689
- Oh, well,
thanks for stopping by.

04:18.758 --> 04:21.482
And never come back.

04:21.551 --> 04:23.551
- FroYo Yo-Yo is
right across the street

04:23.620 --> 04:25.586
in case anyone likes froyo.

04:25.655 --> 04:27.896
Or yo-yos.

04:27.965 --> 04:30.827
- No one wants your froyo
or yo-yos.

04:30.896 --> 04:33.206
- I do.

04:33.275 --> 04:35.827
- You're dead to me, Heather.

04:35.896 --> 04:38.172
- Well,
thanks for the customer.

04:38.241 --> 04:41.482
Also, that painting's gonna
give people nightmares.

04:44.275 --> 04:45.586
- Don't worry, Spenders.

04:45.655 --> 04:48.482
I'm sure she meant
the fun kind of nightmares.

04:48.551 --> 04:50.758
- Buckles is
really stressing me out.

04:50.827 --> 04:52.172
I'm having a hard time sleeping

04:52.241 --> 04:53.689
because she's trying
to drive me out of business.

04:53.758 --> 04:55.206
- No one is going out
of business

04:55.275 --> 04:57.137
because we're going
to catch the night-milker.

04:57.206 --> 04:58.517
- She's right, Spenders.

04:58.586 --> 05:00.413
We're gonna stay here all night
if we have to.

05:00.482 --> 05:01.655
Isn't that right, Munchy?

05:01.724 --> 05:03.137
- That's Detective Munchy.

05:03.206 --> 05:04.689
And as soon as I get
my detective hat,

05:04.758 --> 05:08.655
I'm on the case.

05:08.724 --> 05:09.724
- You guys are in charge,
right?

05:09.793 --> 05:12.000
- Oh, for sure.
- Oh, yeah.

I got everything I need
to catch

05:37.413 --> 05:39.482
whoever is milking the cow
in the middle of the night.

05:39.551 --> 05:41.068
- How are you gonna catch
the Night Milker

05:41.137 --> 05:43.103
with Wrappy Roll?

05:43.172 --> 05:44.689
- I am going to cover
the front door

05:44.758 --> 05:46.310
so when she tries to use it,

05:46.379 --> 05:48.827
Buckles gets a face full
of plastic.

05:48.896 --> 05:50.000
- Wait, why would you think

05:50.068 --> 05:51.379
that the Night Milker
is Buckles?

05:51.448 --> 05:52.793
- It is so obvious.

05:52.862 --> 05:54.551
She's trying to drive
the Mooery out of business

05:54.620 --> 05:56.689
by leaving all the milk out
to spoil.

05:56.758 --> 05:59.103
- Sounds like you solved
the case.

05:59.172 --> 06:02.517
Of how to be so wrong!

06:02.586 --> 06:04.241
Clearly the Night Milker
is the ghost

06:04.310 --> 06:06.206
of Spender's spooky
great-great-grandfather

06:06.275 --> 06:08.758
who's haunting the Mooery
with his rattling milk pail.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.724
- That is ridiculous.

06:10.793 --> 06:13.275
- Ridiculous like a fox!

06:13.344 --> 06:14.689
Think about it.

06:14.758 --> 06:16.103
None of this happened
before Spenders brought

06:16.172 --> 06:17.862
that cursed portrait
into the Mooery.

06:17.931 --> 06:20.241
- Well, it also never happened
before Buckles' froyo shop

06:20.310 --> 06:21.517
moved in across the street.

06:21.586 --> 06:23.413
- Oh, I get it.

06:23.482 --> 06:25.931
You think Buckles is the ghost.

06:28.103 --> 06:32.103
- Did someone say
Detective Munchy?

06:32.172 --> 06:33.413
- No.

06:33.482 --> 06:35.620
- Could someone?

06:35.689 --> 06:37.344
together:
Detective Munchy.

06:37.413 --> 06:39.689
- See?
That's fun!

06:39.758 --> 06:41.586
- Guys,
the Mooery is in trouble.

06:41.655 --> 06:43.655
We have to solve this case
to help Spenders.

06:43.724 --> 06:45.620
- You're right.
Let's get down to business.

06:45.689 --> 06:46.896
Everyone's a suspect.

06:46.965 --> 06:51.655
You, you, and definitely me.

06:51.724 --> 06:53.379
I know I'm hiding something.

06:53.448 --> 06:56.758
Tell me what you know!

06:56.827 --> 06:58.137
- What are you guys up to?

06:58.206 --> 06:59.620
We're spending the night
at the Mooery.

06:59.689 --> 07:01.482
- Great.
I'll have the place to myself.

07:01.551 --> 07:03.793
- Yeah, not exactly.

07:03.862 --> 07:05.551
I've promised Mom and Dad
I would watch you,

07:05.620 --> 07:07.344
but since I can't be here
tonight,

07:07.413 --> 07:11.586
I got someone else to babysit.

07:11.655 --> 07:15.310
- Hello, baby.
I'm your sitter.

about escaping.

a state-of-the-art
security system

You have the keys
to the Mooery,

08:03.000 --> 08:05.517
so obviously
you are the Night Milker!

08:05.586 --> 08:07.758
- Spenders gave me the keys
so we can open the door

08:07.827 --> 08:09.448
and stake out the place.

I thought I'd figured out
the mystery already

08:12.310 --> 08:15.655

for two days.

Oh, sorry.

08:40.586 --> 08:42.689
Hmm.

You got company.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.206
- It's the Night Milker!

18:37.275 --> 18:38.793
He's behind the wall
with the cow!

18:38.862 --> 18:40.689

Everybody knows their job.

If we work together
and we follow the plan--

18:43.034 --> 18:45.413
- Night Jaget!

18:45.482 --> 18:47.551
- That is not the plan!
- Jaget's gone rogue!

18:47.620 --> 18:49.448
Fisher, drop your net!

still in there.

Help me with the ghost sack.

[cow mooing]

We got the Night Milker!

19:13.206 --> 19:15.413
- Help us, Munchy!
- I'm on it!

Luckily, my phone case has
a zap stick.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.551

we got the Night Milker.

19:25.965 --> 19:28.241
Hey, why isn't my finger
going through the ghost?

19:28.310 --> 19:30.758
- Elementary school,
my dear Presley.

19:30.827 --> 19:32.275
This is no ghost.

19:32.344 --> 19:33.724
- So then I was right
all along.

19:33.793 --> 19:35.793
It's Buckles.
- Wrong again.

19:35.862 --> 19:38.310
I've deduced the identity
of the Night Milker,

19:38.379 --> 19:40.172
the one trying to sabotage
Spender's Mooery

19:40.241 --> 19:41.620
is none other than...

19:41.689 --> 19:45.000
Spenders!

Oh, thank goodness.
I was not sure about that.

that net was a butt dial.

♪ ♪

19:57.413 --> 19:58.586
- Munchy, how did you know

19:58.655 --> 20:00.137
that the Night Milker was
Spenders?

20:00.206 --> 20:01.310
- And why don't I remember
doing it?

20:01.379 --> 20:02.758
- That was my first clue.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.758
When you said you were
having trouble sleeping,

20:04.827 --> 20:07.068
the stress of having
FroYo Yo-Yo as competition

20:07.137 --> 20:10.275
has exhausted you to the point
of sleepwalking.

20:10.344 --> 20:12.241
- So he was milking Cash
in his sleep.

20:12.310 --> 20:15.241
- Precisely.

20:15.310 --> 20:17.724
My second clue was when
we video chatted with Spenders.

20:17.793 --> 20:20.758
When you left to take a nap,
you went into the cow pen.

20:20.827 --> 20:22.482
[both gasping]

20:22.551 --> 20:24.517
- Wait, why is that a clue?

20:24.586 --> 20:26.103
- Because it means that

20:26.172 --> 20:28.724
Spenders has a private stairway
that connects the cow pen

20:28.793 --> 20:30.862
directly
to his apartment upstairs.

20:30.931 --> 20:31.931
- It's true.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.172
- Yes.

20:33.241 --> 20:35.241
Wasn't quite sure about
that one, either.

20:35.310 --> 20:36.655
- Wait, hold on.

20:36.724 --> 20:39.172
What about the painting
of Colonel Moostache?

20:39.241 --> 20:40.551
His ghost knocked it
off the wall.

20:40.620 --> 20:41.862
- Ah, but remember when

20:41.931 --> 20:43.448
I knocked that sign
to the ground earlier?

20:43.517 --> 20:45.206
You thought I was clumsy.

20:45.275 --> 20:48.620
But I suspect that Spenders is
terrible at hanging things.

20:48.689 --> 20:49.862
- I am.

20:49.931 --> 20:51.827
I've been battling it
my whole life.

20:51.896 --> 20:54.758
- And you're going to battle it
for the rest of your life.

20:54.827 --> 20:56.241
In the big house.

20:56.310 --> 20:59.172
Take him away, boys!

20:59.241 --> 21:03.137
- He's not going to prison.
- And there are no boys.

21:03.206 --> 21:07.310
- Okay, I'm gonna let you off
with a warning.

21:07.379 --> 21:09.655

Hope there's no more nets.

- Well, I was wrong about
the Night Milker being Buckles.

21:32.862 --> 21:35.068
- And I was wrong about it
being a ghost.

21:35.137 --> 21:36.241
- But Munchy was right.

21:36.310 --> 21:37.827
- Yeah.
Great job, Munch Man.

21:37.896 --> 21:40.862
- Detective Munchy declares
this case closed.

There's just one thing
I never figured out.

Who drank the chocolate milk
I set out as bait last night?

are you a fake detective?
