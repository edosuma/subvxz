00:24.237 --> 00:26.804
What if we got married on the Cyclone?

00:26.839 --> 00:29.173
The roller coaster at Coney Island?

00:29.207 --> 00:31.275
Come on. How much fun would that be?

00:31.309 --> 00:33.711
And talk about an appropriate,

00:33.746 --> 00:35.747
if not slightly on-the-nose metaphor...

00:35.781 --> 00:37.882
a bride and groom together,
side-by-side,

00:37.917 --> 00:40.051
as they go through the ups and downs,

00:40.085 --> 00:41.986
the twists and turns,
and the loop-de-loops of life.

00:42.021 --> 00:42.987
Castle, I love you,

00:43.022 --> 00:44.755
but I will not marry you on a ride

00:44.789 --> 00:46.790
or up in space or on a slide.

00:46.824 --> 00:49.026
Bet Dr. Seuss got married somewhere fun.

00:49.061 --> 00:50.861
Yes, his wife's living room.

00:52.164 --> 00:54.365
How many people do you think can fit

00:54.399 --> 00:56.633
in one of those
roller-coaster cars, anyway?

00:56.668 --> 00:58.135
20? 30?

00:58.170 --> 01:00.304
You know, that's a good point.

01:00.338 --> 01:03.373
We should determine exactly whom
we are going to invite.

01:03.407 --> 01:05.241
Yeah, good idea.

01:05.275 --> 01:07.410
That way we can determine
exactly how big

01:07.445 --> 01:09.479
a roller-coaster car we need to build.

01:09.513 --> 01:11.314
Or how big of an actual venue we need.

01:11.348 --> 01:13.149
Either way, I'll go and get the paper.

01:13.184 --> 01:14.885
I'll get a pen.

01:14.919 --> 01:16.853
And I will get the phone.

01:18.021 --> 01:19.021
Beckett.

01:23.627 --> 01:25.128
You know, there's a good argument

01:25.162 --> 01:26.563
for keeping the list really small.

01:26.597 --> 01:27.663
Just immediate family.

01:27.698 --> 01:29.899
This argument doesn't have
something to do with

01:29.933 --> 01:31.634
a certain amusement park ride, does it?

01:31.668 --> 01:32.702
I'm being serious.

01:32.736 --> 01:34.604
Getting married is an intimate act,

01:34.638 --> 01:36.439
and our ceremony
should reflect that intimacy.

01:36.473 --> 01:38.674
And that way,
we could all fit into one car.

01:38.709 --> 01:40.576
Ryan, how do you feel
about roller coasters?

01:40.611 --> 01:41.844
Ooh, make me nauseous. Why?

01:41.878 --> 01:43.713
No reason. Who's our victim?

01:43.747 --> 01:46.315
Peter Cordero, 26.

01:46.349 --> 01:47.950
According to the super, he lives alone.

01:47.985 --> 01:49.885
He's a future's trader at JP Harding,

01:49.920 --> 01:51.620
the Wall Street investment firm.

01:51.654 --> 01:52.721
And how was he killed?

01:52.755 --> 01:54.256
Uh, single GSW to the chest.

01:54.290 --> 01:56.425
Looks like his own future got traded.

01:56.459 --> 01:58.127
Yeah, not without a fight first.

01:58.161 --> 01:59.894
Who found the body?

01:59.929 --> 02:01.763
Well, that's an interesting question.

02:01.797 --> 02:05.967
At 10:03 P.M., a woman made a 911 call

02:06.002 --> 02:07.802
from a pay phone down the block,

02:07.837 --> 02:09.704
but she refused to leave her name.

02:09.739 --> 02:11.072
A pay phone down the block?

02:11.107 --> 02:13.074
But how would she know
he was dead unless...

02:13.109 --> 02:14.909
Unless she was in the apartment.

02:14.944 --> 02:17.612
Well, lividity places the time of death

02:17.647 --> 02:18.980
between 8:00 and 10:00,

02:19.015 --> 02:21.616
so if the 911 call came in at 10:03...

02:21.651 --> 02:23.551
She could be our killer.

02:23.585 --> 02:25.253
Esposito's checking
security-cam footage.

02:25.287 --> 02:26.608
Hopefully, we caught her on tape.

02:26.622 --> 02:29.023
Now, is it just me, or is it odd

02:29.057 --> 02:31.325
that our victim is wearing
a suit jacket, tie, pants,

02:31.360 --> 02:33.927
shoes, but his shirt is unbuttoned?

02:33.962 --> 02:36.430
It's odd, all right. And look at this...

02:36.465 --> 02:41.135
his shirt was on <i>and</i> buttoned
when he was shot.

02:41.169 --> 02:43.303
So our killer unbuttoned
his shirt <i>after</i> he was dead.

02:43.337 --> 02:44.672
Yep.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.007
The killer was looking for something.

02:47.042 --> 02:50.177
A pricy necklace or...
oh, a bunch of cash

02:50.211 --> 02:52.146
taped to his chest
like "Wolf of Wall Street."

02:52.180 --> 02:53.781
There's something else.

02:53.815 --> 02:55.415
I didn't find any defensive wounds,

02:55.449 --> 02:57.217
so if there was a fight out there,

02:57.251 --> 02:58.572
I don't think this guy was in it.

02:59.687 --> 03:00.853
Yo, Beckett.

03:00.888 --> 03:02.622
There are no security cameras
in the lobby,

03:02.657 --> 03:05.258
but I found one in
a liquor store down the street.

03:05.293 --> 03:07.661
It got a shot of that pay phone

03:07.695 --> 03:10.297
right when the 911 call came in.

03:10.331 --> 03:11.631
Okay. Canvas the neighbors.

03:11.666 --> 03:13.365
See if anyone saw her in the building.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.767
Did you talk to next of kin yet?

03:14.802 --> 03:16.435
Well, the guy didn't have
any immediate family,

03:16.469 --> 03:19.105
but he did list a cousin in Queens,

03:19.139 --> 03:21.307
a Maria Cordero,
as his in-case-of-emergency.

03:21.341 --> 03:22.675
All right, bring her in.

03:22.710 --> 03:25.178
Let's see if she recognizes
the woman in the photo.

03:25.212 --> 03:26.579
Castle and I will go
to his place of work

03:26.613 --> 03:27.646
and see what they know there.

03:27.681 --> 03:30.349
All right.

03:34.020 --> 03:38.724
No. No. I'm sorry. I don't know her.

03:38.758 --> 03:40.626
Maria, did your cousin say anything

03:40.660 --> 03:42.027
about having a girlfriend?

03:42.061 --> 03:44.463
No. He said he didn't have time.
Work was his life.

03:44.497 --> 03:46.064
Were the two of you close?

03:46.099 --> 03:48.900
Peter was like my brother.

03:49.936 --> 03:51.236
When he was 10, his parents died

03:51.270 --> 03:53.338
in the big earthquake in Venezuela.

03:53.372 --> 03:55.974
My parents adopted him
and brought him to the States.

03:56.008 --> 03:59.544
Did Peter say anything
about having any enemies?

03:59.578 --> 04:02.447
No. Peter was a sweet guy.

04:02.481 --> 04:04.716
He never forgot where he came from...

04:04.750 --> 04:07.051
not like those privileged,
silver-spoon types

04:07.085 --> 04:08.519
he worked with.

04:08.554 --> 04:09.721
He was a scholarship kid,

04:09.755 --> 04:12.823
so everything he got
was through hard work.

04:12.858 --> 04:14.325
When did you talk to him last?

04:14.360 --> 04:16.427
A few days ago.

04:16.462 --> 04:17.827
And how did he seem?

04:20.065 --> 04:21.331
Stressed, actually.

04:21.366 --> 04:23.267
Did he say what about?

04:23.301 --> 04:25.269
No. I... I don't know.

04:25.303 --> 04:28.005
When I asked him, he said
something happened at work,

04:28.039 --> 04:30.307
but it wasn't anything
he couldn't handle.

04:33.278 --> 04:36.546
JP Harding Investment Bank.

04:36.581 --> 04:39.316
This place is either
the engine of capitalism

04:39.350 --> 04:42.051
or the poster child
of greed and corruption,

04:42.086 --> 04:44.254
depending on which paper you read.

04:44.289 --> 04:46.856
Maybe the invisible hand
of the market killed Peter.

04:46.891 --> 04:49.192
It would explain
the lack of defensive wounds.

04:49.226 --> 04:51.027
You know, prep-school buddy of mine

04:51.061 --> 04:52.762
came to work here out of college.

04:52.797 --> 04:55.431
He made a quarter of a billion
dollars before he was 30,

04:55.465 --> 04:57.066
retired, and bought an island.

04:57.101 --> 04:58.634
Wait. He owns his own island?

04:58.669 --> 05:01.671
We should definitely invite him
to the wedding.

05:01.705 --> 05:03.606
Excuse me. Hi, I'm detective Beckett.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.809
We need to speak
with Peter Cordero's boss.

05:05.843 --> 05:07.110
Jamie Berman, I believe?

05:07.144 --> 05:08.505
Can I tell him what it's regarding?

05:08.512 --> 05:10.780
Killing...

05:10.814 --> 05:12.981
are you capable of it?

05:13.016 --> 05:17.152
Because if you are,
I will make you rich.

05:17.187 --> 05:21.691
Goldman just poached
Consolidated's pension account

05:21.725 --> 05:26.161
from us this morning,
so I am offering a bounty.

05:26.196 --> 05:27.429
Neal?

05:30.099 --> 05:32.968
A million dollars to the first
son of a bitch at this table

05:33.002 --> 05:34.903
to poach an account back from Goldman.

05:34.938 --> 05:38.740
It's open season, guys...
open-hunting season.

05:38.774 --> 05:41.943
I want you to make them bleed!

05:41.977 --> 05:42.857
Excuse me.

05:42.878 --> 05:45.046
All right, let's go!

05:45.080 --> 05:46.314
Excuse me, Mr. Berman.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.627
Detective Beckett.
Could we have a word, please?

05:49.652 --> 05:52.954
I told you S.E.C. pricks
to talk to my lawyer.

05:52.988 --> 05:56.924
I'm not S.E.C. I'm NYPD... homicide.

05:56.959 --> 05:59.260
Homicide?

05:59.294 --> 06:02.696
I apologize for the theatrics,
detective,

06:02.731 --> 06:06.100
but in this world, it gets results.

06:06.134 --> 06:07.434
And here I thought the stories

06:07.469 --> 06:09.203
of Wall Street excess were exaggerated.

06:09.238 --> 06:11.638
Mr. Berman, I understand
that Peter Cordero

06:11.673 --> 06:13.040
reported directly to you.

06:13.075 --> 06:15.342
Yes, he was my best commodities' trader.

06:15.377 --> 06:17.344
And one of the nicest guys
you'll ever meet.

06:17.379 --> 06:19.446
In this part of the world, anyway.

06:19.481 --> 06:20.481
Do you have any leads?

06:20.515 --> 06:21.915
Uh, just one.

06:21.949 --> 06:25.051
Do you recognize this woman?

06:25.086 --> 06:27.788
No. I'm afraid I don't.

06:27.822 --> 06:30.824
Well, according to
Peter Cordero's family,

06:30.859 --> 06:32.420
he was having some trouble here at work.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.160
Do you have any idea
what that might have been?

06:34.195 --> 06:35.528
No idea.

06:35.562 --> 06:36.629
In fact, he was having

06:36.663 --> 06:38.143
one of the best months he's ever had.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.566
And what about his clients?
Any problems there?

06:40.601 --> 06:43.403
Well, Pete was a rising star.
His clients loved him...

06:43.437 --> 06:44.537
But...

06:44.571 --> 06:46.572
But what?

06:46.607 --> 06:50.877
Last week, I was taking
the stairs to the 65th floor...

06:50.911 --> 06:53.646
my version of exercise...

06:53.680 --> 06:55.114
and I saw Peter in the stairwell

06:55.148 --> 06:56.982
with this guy
who looked like a gangbanger.

06:57.017 --> 07:01.454
All tatted up his neck,
big scar on his cheek.

07:01.488 --> 07:03.556
Not the kind of guy
you ever see down here.

07:03.590 --> 07:07.026
And he was handing Peter
a package about yea big.

07:07.060 --> 07:10.495
When Peter saw me,
he looked guilty as hell.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.764
So I just kept walking.

07:12.799 --> 07:14.800
And you didn't ask him about it?

07:14.834 --> 07:16.068
Yeah, I did later,

07:16.102 --> 07:19.538
but he said it was nothing,
so I just let it go.

07:19.572 --> 07:21.406
You saw a gangbanger in your stairwell,

07:21.441 --> 07:23.608
and you just let it go?

07:23.643 --> 07:25.911
This is a high-stress
environment, detective.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.212
We don't ask a lot of questions

07:28.247 --> 07:31.249
about what our people do to...
to get through the day.

07:31.283 --> 07:32.517
Okay.

07:32.552 --> 07:33.952
Do you think you can
describe him to a sketch artist?

07:33.986 --> 07:35.086
I think so.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.455
Great.

07:36.489 --> 07:38.389
I need the names of all of
Peter's associates here at work.

07:38.424 --> 07:39.390
Of course.

07:39.425 --> 07:40.891
Lanie's got something for us.

07:42.261 --> 07:44.295
Still no indication
of defensive wounds,

07:44.330 --> 07:49.167
but I did find this when
I checked his nails for DNA.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.137
Numbers.

07:53.172 --> 07:54.605
"7, 2, 3, 5, 9, 8."

07:54.639 --> 07:57.741
He wrote it in pen
I'd say four or five days ago.

07:57.776 --> 08:00.478
But that's not why I called you.

08:00.512 --> 08:02.212
Look at this.

08:02.246 --> 08:05.716
On his chest, next to the "Y" incision.

08:07.786 --> 08:10.087
- Look at what?
- It's subtle...

08:10.121 --> 08:12.489
so subtle, I almost missed it.

08:12.523 --> 08:15.292
But I think it explains
why his shirt was ripped open.

08:16.594 --> 08:18.962
- You see this grainy material?
- Yeah.

08:18.997 --> 08:20.597
It's adhesive residue.

08:20.631 --> 08:22.165
In fact, there's a residue pattern

08:22.200 --> 08:23.766
from his belly to his chest.

08:23.801 --> 08:24.834
Adhesive?

08:24.869 --> 08:25.935
Mm-hmm.

08:25.970 --> 08:27.236
Looking at the pattern,

08:27.270 --> 08:29.190
I'd say your Wall Street wolf
was wearing a wire.

08:30.340 --> 08:32.741
A wire?

08:32.775 --> 08:34.243
Yes, sir.

08:34.277 --> 08:35.378
We believe our killer removed it

08:35.412 --> 08:36.445
from the victim's body
after shooting him.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.481
Do we know who
he was wearing a wire for?

08:38.515 --> 08:39.782
Well, we're checking

08:39.817 --> 08:41.751
with other branches
of law enforcement right now.

08:41.784 --> 08:43.751
What about this woman
who called in the murder?

08:43.785 --> 08:44.920
Have you been able to identify her?

08:44.954 --> 08:46.188
You know, no one in Cordero's life

08:46.223 --> 08:47.923
seems to know who she is,

08:47.957 --> 08:49.791
and we have no idea where to find her.

08:49.826 --> 08:52.395
I... think she just found us.

08:54.064 --> 08:55.531
Oh, Lord.

08:55.565 --> 08:58.501
I'd say your case
just got a lot more complicated.

08:58.535 --> 08:59.668
What is it, sir?

08:59.702 --> 09:02.103
They're from the U.S. Attorney's Office.

09:02.138 --> 09:03.138
You know them?

09:03.172 --> 09:04.506
Uh, not the woman from the photo,

09:04.541 --> 09:06.542
but the woman with her
is Elizabeth Weston,

09:06.576 --> 09:09.945
the U.S. Attorney
for the Southern District.

09:09.979 --> 09:13.114
She also happens to be my sister.

09:17.141 --> 09:22.141

09:29.981 --> 09:32.970
Victoria. Been a while.

09:32.986 --> 09:34.620
Yes, it has.

09:37.624 --> 09:38.924
And who is this?

09:38.958 --> 09:41.327
I'm Stefanie Goldmark,
Assistant U.S. Attorney.

09:41.361 --> 09:43.262
We're here about the Cordero murder.

09:44.590 --> 09:45.923
Oh, well, that's funny,

09:45.958 --> 09:47.257
because we have a few questions
about that ourselves.

09:47.292 --> 09:49.159
Starting, Ms. Goldmark,

09:49.194 --> 09:50.561
with why you didn't identify yourself

09:50.596 --> 09:52.997
when you made that 911 call
from the pay phone.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.334
Because I instructed her not to.

09:58.704 --> 10:01.305
I couldn't afford to
compromise our investigation.

10:01.339 --> 10:02.406
What investigation?

10:05.143 --> 10:07.177
Is there somewhere private we can talk?

10:09.247 --> 10:12.816
All right, Elizabeth,
what's this all about?

10:12.850 --> 10:15.685
Your victim was a confidential
informant for my office

10:15.720 --> 10:18.522
in an ongoing criminal
investigation of JP Harding.

10:18.556 --> 10:21.958
Which is why Cordero was wearing a wire.

10:21.993 --> 10:23.693
Yes, and since JP Harding
is on the 65th floor,

10:23.728 --> 10:25.194
we couldn't monitor it live.

10:25.229 --> 10:28.297
Cordero put it on every morning
and turned it in every night,

10:28.332 --> 10:30.634
along with the attached
recording device.

10:30.668 --> 10:32.035
Only last night, he didn't.

10:32.069 --> 10:34.370
I went to his apartment
to see what happened.

10:34.404 --> 10:38.141
That's when I found him,
and the wire was gone.

10:38.175 --> 10:39.575
We think that there was something key

10:39.610 --> 10:41.310
to our investigation on that wire
and that's why he was killed.

10:41.345 --> 10:42.678
So where are you on leads?

10:46.082 --> 10:47.283
Well, uh, ballistics
is running the slug,

10:47.317 --> 10:49.385
but right now the only lead
is this sketch,

10:49.419 --> 10:52.255
provided by Mr. Cordero's boss,
Jamie Berman.

10:52.289 --> 10:54.957
It's of a man he saw with our victim.

10:54.991 --> 10:56.625
Well, I wouldn't put
much credence in that sketch.

10:56.660 --> 10:58.160
Why? Why is that?

10:58.194 --> 11:01.964
Because Berman is the target
of our investigation.

11:01.998 --> 11:03.799
Jamie Berman, head of JP Harding?

11:03.833 --> 11:05.801
We've been trying to mount
a case against him for years...

11:05.835 --> 11:07.069
insider trading, securities fraud.

11:07.103 --> 11:08.570
We know he's doing it.

11:08.604 --> 11:10.172
We just haven't been able to get proof.

11:10.206 --> 11:12.307
Not without getting inside.

11:12.341 --> 11:13.708
Berman's too careful.

11:13.742 --> 11:15.710
Then, last month, we caught a break.

11:15.744 --> 11:17.512
Peter Cordero was found
with a baggie of cocaine

11:17.547 --> 11:18.813
during a stop-and-frisk.

11:18.847 --> 11:21.849
With his priors for possession
when he was a teen,

11:21.884 --> 11:23.017
he was facing 5 to 10.

11:23.052 --> 11:24.986
You got Cordero to play ball.

11:25.020 --> 11:26.921
He jumped at an immunity deal.

11:26.955 --> 11:28.890
He'd already gotten valuable information

11:28.924 --> 11:29.991
on his wire recordings.

11:30.025 --> 11:32.359
But yesterday, he was scheduled

11:32.394 --> 11:33.634
to meet with Berman one-on-one.

11:33.662 --> 11:35.296
He was gonna push him to open up
about some of his deals.

11:35.330 --> 11:37.131
Cordero may have pushed too hard.

11:37.166 --> 11:41.135
We think Berman made
Cordero in that meeting.

11:41.170 --> 11:43.804
So you think Jamie Berman's
somehow responsible

11:43.838 --> 11:44.805
for Cordero's death?

11:44.839 --> 11:46.006
Well, if Berman knew

11:46.040 --> 11:48.275
he had incriminated himself on tape...

11:48.310 --> 11:50.977
He'd go to any lengths to get it back.

11:51.012 --> 11:53.714
Victoria, this investigation is ongoing,

11:53.748 --> 11:56.584
and exposing it to Mr. Berman
or anyone at JP Harding

11:56.618 --> 11:58.485
would break federal statutes.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.486
But I thought that this was something

12:00.521 --> 12:02.789
that you and your team needed to know.

12:02.824 --> 12:04.024
I'd certainly say so.

12:04.058 --> 12:06.793
So I trust that you will keep
my office in the loop

12:06.828 --> 12:09.162
if there are any...
significant developments.

12:09.197 --> 12:10.897
Is that clear?

12:10.932 --> 12:12.298
Of course.

12:20.307 --> 12:23.008
Sir, I didn't...
I didn't know you had a sister.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.478
Oh, well, now you do.

12:29.717 --> 12:33.619
U.S. Attorney for the Southern District?

12:33.653 --> 12:35.821
That's a really big deal.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.757
Why hasn't Gates
ever mentioned her before?

12:37.791 --> 12:40.092
I don't know, but there was
definitely a subtle chill

12:40.127 --> 12:41.293
between the two of them.

12:41.327 --> 12:42.694
"A subtle chill"?

12:42.729 --> 12:45.097
More like a polar vortex.

12:45.132 --> 12:48.134
I'm guessing something happened
between them in the past...

12:48.168 --> 12:49.534
something deeply personal

12:49.569 --> 12:52.371
that Gates does not want us
to know about.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.139
I'll give you a dollar if you ask her.

12:54.173 --> 12:56.141
- No way.
- Come on. Aren't you curious?

12:56.175 --> 12:57.842
Yeah, but I like my job too much.

12:57.877 --> 12:59.478
Hey, so, uh, there may be something

12:59.512 --> 13:00.912
to the U.S. Attorney's theory.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.381
I checked Cordero's calendar.

13:02.415 --> 13:03.749
He was scheduled to meet with Berman

13:03.783 --> 13:05.083
at 5:00 P.M. yesterday.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.684
And whatever they talked about,
it got heated.

13:06.718 --> 13:07.786
How do you know that?

13:07.820 --> 13:09.453
According to building security,

13:09.488 --> 13:11.622
the two of them left shortly after

13:11.657 --> 13:13.892
and seemed to be
in the middle of a fight.

13:19.265 --> 13:22.333
Yeah, Peter and I had words yesterday.

13:22.367 --> 13:23.334
So what?

13:23.368 --> 13:25.068
So, you didn't tell us about that

13:25.103 --> 13:27.070
- when we talked this morning.
- 'Cause it wasn't relevant.

13:27.105 --> 13:28.238
How is it not relevant?

13:28.273 --> 13:29.674
The video shows you leaving together.

13:29.708 --> 13:30.874
Two hours later, he's dead.

13:30.909 --> 13:33.344
It's not relevant
because I didn't kill him.

13:33.378 --> 13:37.748
Honestly, detective,
what would be my motive?

13:37.783 --> 13:39.917
What exactly were the two of you
arguing about?

13:39.951 --> 13:41.285
A business deal.

13:42.183 --> 13:44.063
You looked pretty worked up
for a business deal.

13:44.088 --> 13:46.123
There was a lot riding on it.

13:46.157 --> 13:47.624
What was the deal?

13:47.658 --> 13:50.093
Client confidentiality, detective.

13:50.128 --> 13:51.628
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

13:51.662 --> 13:54.631
You had a meeting
with Peter before that.

13:54.665 --> 13:56.098
What were you speaking about then?

13:56.133 --> 13:57.099
Other financial matters.

13:57.134 --> 13:58.468
What kind of financial matters?

13:58.502 --> 14:01.504
Sensitive ones, any discussion of which,

14:01.539 --> 14:02.972
even with law enforcement,

14:03.006 --> 14:05.074
would be considered insider trading.

14:05.108 --> 14:06.175
So unless you have a subpoena...

14:06.210 --> 14:07.610
Who else was at the meeting?

14:07.645 --> 14:09.446
Just the two of us.

14:09.480 --> 14:10.980
And what did you do
after you left the lobby?

14:11.014 --> 14:13.916
Oh, we walked up Lafayette
and parted ways around Spring.

14:13.951 --> 14:15.117
What time was that?

14:15.152 --> 14:16.285
Around 6:15.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.653
Where were you between 8:00 and 10:00?

14:17.687 --> 14:19.388
At my usual table at Le Cirque.

14:19.422 --> 14:21.190
Feel free to check.

14:21.225 --> 14:22.825
It's time.

14:22.860 --> 14:24.994
Now, if you'll excuse me,

14:25.028 --> 14:27.029
I have a conference call with the Fed.

14:27.064 --> 14:31.567
Oh, and if you want to talk
to me again, detective,

14:31.601 --> 14:34.269
call my lawyer.

14:39.208 --> 14:40.576
Le Cirque confirms that Berman was there

14:40.610 --> 14:43.178
from 8:00 P.M. till 10:25.

14:43.212 --> 14:44.545
Couldn't have been him.

14:44.580 --> 14:46.547
'Cause a guy like Berman
isn't gonna get his hands dirty.

14:46.582 --> 14:47.715
He's gonna hire someone.

14:47.750 --> 14:49.918
No, your sister's right.
Berman is behind this.

14:49.952 --> 14:51.452
And speaking of your sister...

14:51.487 --> 14:52.553
Let's not.

14:52.588 --> 14:55.690
If Berman is behind this,

14:55.724 --> 14:57.658
he will do everything he can
to protect himself.

14:57.693 --> 14:58.860
Knowing that the feds are watching him,

14:58.895 --> 15:00.728
he would be careful to cover his tracks.

15:00.763 --> 15:02.797
It's gonna be next to impossible

15:02.831 --> 15:04.331
to trace this back to him.

15:04.366 --> 15:05.900
So, all we're really sure of

15:05.934 --> 15:07.502
is that the sketch he gave us

15:07.536 --> 15:08.903
is a load of fictitious crap

15:08.937 --> 15:09.970
meant to send us in the wrong direction.

15:10.005 --> 15:11.972
It's not as fictitious as you think.

15:12.007 --> 15:13.040
I just got the ballistics back

15:13.074 --> 15:14.395
on the bullet that killed Cordero.

15:14.410 --> 15:16.744
Striations match a slug that was pulled

15:16.779 --> 15:17.912
from a robbery shooting at a bodega

15:17.946 --> 15:19.613
in the Bronx three months ago.

15:19.647 --> 15:20.881
The detectives couldn't make a case,

15:20.916 --> 15:24.551
but their three best suspects
were gang members,

15:24.585 --> 15:25.886
including this guy.

15:25.921 --> 15:27.554
Same guy. Same gun.

15:27.588 --> 15:28.923
Hector Nunez?

15:28.957 --> 15:30.257
Yeah, runs the South Bronx territory

15:30.292 --> 15:31.525
of Los Caballeros gang.

15:31.559 --> 15:34.928
Priors include assault,
attempted manslaughter,

15:34.962 --> 15:36.830
and conspiracy to distribute cocaine.

15:38.966 --> 15:41.034
No, you're wrong.

15:41.068 --> 15:42.302
Peter had nothing to do with cocaine.

15:42.336 --> 15:43.670
He hated drugs.

15:43.704 --> 15:46.005
Do you know he was arrested
last month for possession?

15:46.040 --> 15:47.574
That's impossible. I know Peter.

15:47.608 --> 15:48.942
He'd never use that stuff.

15:48.976 --> 15:50.276
Are you <i>sure,</i> Maria?

15:50.311 --> 15:52.245
Because he was seen receiving

15:52.279 --> 15:55.614
a package last week from this guy.

15:55.649 --> 15:57.250
No.

15:57.284 --> 15:58.384
No.

15:58.419 --> 15:59.518
It... it can't be.

15:59.553 --> 16:00.686
Do you recognize him?

16:00.720 --> 16:02.355
Hector Nunez.

16:02.389 --> 16:04.057
He was Peter's best friend growing up.

16:04.091 --> 16:05.758
But then he got mixed up in a gang,

16:05.792 --> 16:07.460
and he tried to drag Peter in, too.

16:07.494 --> 16:11.196
Afterwards, Hector changed.
He became dangerous.

16:11.230 --> 16:13.866
Peter cut ties with him
over a decade ago.

16:15.401 --> 16:17.801
Can you think of any reason why
he'd be back in Peter's life?

16:17.804 --> 16:19.171
Hector was a devil.

16:19.205 --> 16:21.574
Peter would have never gotten
mixed up with him again...

16:23.176 --> 16:25.944
...unless he didn't have a choice.

16:39.306 --> 16:40.706
This is a long way from Wall Street.

16:40.740 --> 16:41.861
This doesn't make any sense.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.477
If Peter <i>was</i> into drugs,

16:44.511 --> 16:46.645
he had enough money
to get them from downtown.

16:46.680 --> 16:48.414
Why would he risk getting them

16:48.449 --> 16:49.949
from someone that he knew was dangerous?

16:49.983 --> 16:52.084
There it is... El Baile Club.

16:52.118 --> 16:55.353
Yeah, unofficial headquarters
of Los Caballeros.

16:55.388 --> 16:56.755
Stick close.

16:56.790 --> 16:58.591
If Hector's as dangerous as advertised,

16:58.625 --> 17:00.158
things might get a little hairy.

17:00.193 --> 17:02.828
"Hairy's" my middle name.

17:02.862 --> 17:04.730
That sounded a lot better in my head.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.374
Are you sure this is the right place?

17:16.409 --> 17:18.276
Those guys don't look very dangerous.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.480
What about those guys?

17:22.513 --> 17:25.016
Ah, you mean the heavily-armed ones.

17:28.020 --> 17:29.453
We're looking for Hector Nunez.

17:32.157 --> 17:33.257
Beckett.

17:41.366 --> 17:43.467
Hector Nunez?

17:44.769 --> 17:46.670
Detective Beckett, NYPD.

17:48.240 --> 17:51.342
Detective, you shouldn't be here.

17:51.376 --> 17:52.976
You could get hurt.

17:53.011 --> 17:55.311
It's a dangerous neighborhood.

17:55.346 --> 17:57.014
Yeah, well, maybe I should take you

17:57.048 --> 17:58.148
down to my neighborhood.

17:58.182 --> 17:59.750
Let me save you some time.

17:59.784 --> 18:01.818
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

18:03.220 --> 18:06.623
And I suppose you've never heard
of a Peter Cordero, either.

18:06.658 --> 18:07.891
What about Peter?

18:09.027 --> 18:10.393
He's dead.

18:17.868 --> 18:19.902
Who did this?

18:19.936 --> 18:21.337
Well, we were thinking you...

18:22.540 --> 18:25.941
...might... be able to... tell us.

18:25.976 --> 18:28.711
I'd never hurt Peter.

18:28.745 --> 18:31.346
He was my best friend.

18:31.381 --> 18:33.348
When we were kids
and the gang wanted to take him,

18:33.383 --> 18:34.483
I wouldn't let them.

18:34.517 --> 18:36.618
I knew he could do better.

18:36.653 --> 18:40.289
So how did he end up
shot and killed with <i>your</i> gun?

18:40.323 --> 18:42.024
Something was going on with him.

18:42.059 --> 18:44.326
He called me last week...
first time in years.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.595
Said he was into some deal
that was gonna make him rich,

18:46.629 --> 18:48.463
but it was dangerous.

18:48.498 --> 18:49.565
In case something went wrong,

18:49.599 --> 18:50.720
he needed to protect himself.

18:50.733 --> 18:53.168
He said he need a weapon.

18:53.203 --> 18:54.736
You're saying you gave him that gun?

18:54.770 --> 18:56.371
Well, he said
he couldn't buy one himself

18:56.372 --> 18:58.707
'cause he was being watched
all the time.

18:58.741 --> 19:01.221
Was that what was in the package
you gave him in the stairwell?

19:01.944 --> 19:03.277
Yeah.

19:03.312 --> 19:05.980
That deal that he was into...
was it drugs?

19:06.015 --> 19:08.583
Not drugs, money.

19:08.617 --> 19:10.752
Something to do with bank accounts.

19:10.786 --> 19:12.420
"Bank accounts"?

19:12.454 --> 19:14.923
Last Thursday night, he came to me,

19:14.957 --> 19:17.558
said he needed one last favor.

19:17.593 --> 19:18.626
He wanted me to take an envelope

19:18.660 --> 19:21.128
to a manager at some bank in Midtown...

19:21.162 --> 19:23.097
Suisse Federal or something.

19:23.131 --> 19:24.665
Why couldn't he
just do it himself?

19:24.700 --> 19:26.267
Why would he need you?

19:26.301 --> 19:28.102
Said he couldn't afford
to be seen at the bank...

19:28.136 --> 19:29.103
was too risky.

19:29.137 --> 19:30.671
What was in the envelope?

19:30.706 --> 19:33.307
He said something
about transfer instructions.

19:33.342 --> 19:36.243
It was sealed, but there was
a bank account number

19:36.277 --> 19:37.277
written on the outside.

19:37.311 --> 19:38.746
Do you remember the number?

19:38.780 --> 19:41.514
Wrote it down
in case something went wrong.

19:41.549 --> 19:44.218
I guess it did.

19:47.599 --> 19:49.599
Not the same six-digit number
that was on his hand.

19:49.624 --> 19:52.525
After I took the envelope to the bank,

19:52.560 --> 19:54.694
I called Peter at work
to confirm it was done.

19:54.729 --> 19:57.330
That's the last time we talked.

20:00.134 --> 20:04.103
Hector's alibi checks out.

20:04.138 --> 20:06.005
He was at Lady of Mercy nursing home

20:06.039 --> 20:08.274
visiting his mom when Peter was killed.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.609
Mysterious financial transactions,

20:10.644 --> 20:12.611
a deal so dangerous he needed a gun...

20:12.646 --> 20:14.113
seems to me there's a lot more

20:14.148 --> 20:15.948
to your sister's star witness
than she knew.

20:15.983 --> 20:19.318
"Than she knew" or than she
chose to tell us about?

20:19.867 --> 20:21.001
Sir?

20:22.890 --> 20:24.723
Yo. Talked to the manager
at Suisse Federal.

20:24.758 --> 20:27.125
He confirmed that a bank account
with those numbers exists,

20:27.160 --> 20:29.861
but he refused to give out
any information on it.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.863
Did he at least acknowledge
it was Peter Cordero's account?

20:31.898 --> 20:35.033
He couldn't,
because he didn't know himself.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.535
It's a numbered account
set up for privacy,

20:36.569 --> 20:38.170
so the only way that anyone can
access it is with a password.

20:38.204 --> 20:40.738
So there's no way to know
what Cordero was doing.

20:40.773 --> 20:41.472
No.

20:41.507 --> 20:43.008
Unless...

20:45.111 --> 20:47.478
Six digits?

20:47.513 --> 20:49.647
Seems kind of password-y to me.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.019
Okay, read it to me.

20:54.053 --> 20:56.987
7, 2, 3, 5, 9, 8.

20:57.022 --> 20:58.556
Come on.

21:00.693 --> 21:01.559
We're in.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.328
Castle, you've done it again.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.161
What's it say?

21:08.133 --> 21:09.767
The balance is zero dollars.

21:09.802 --> 21:12.637
Zero dollars? That doesn't seem
very dangerous.

21:12.671 --> 21:14.171
Feels like the end of a treasure hunt

21:14.206 --> 21:16.367
where you open up the chest
and it's just full of sand.

21:16.374 --> 21:18.375
Wait. Go to the day Mr. Nunez claims

21:18.409 --> 21:20.311
he did the transfer, March 21st.

21:21.446 --> 21:25.249
Oh, my God. $25 million.

21:25.283 --> 21:27.718
Whoa. <i>That's</i> some expensive sand.

21:27.752 --> 21:29.653
Looks like it came into the account

21:29.687 --> 21:31.688
the day before at 8:34 in the morning,

21:31.723 --> 21:33.689
and then Hector transferred it out.

21:33.724 --> 21:37.693
A secret $25 million transfer
that got him killed.

21:39.230 --> 21:41.430
What the hell was Cordero into?

21:48.743 --> 21:51.305
- Right.
- Any luck?

21:51.337 --> 21:53.926
No. I just talked to
the head of Suisse Federal Bank.

21:53.957 --> 21:55.224
Given international banking regulations,

21:55.258 --> 21:56.526
there's no way to tell

21:56.560 --> 21:58.193
where that money came from
or were it went.

21:58.228 --> 21:59.862
Of if the money's even Cordero's.

21:59.897 --> 22:01.497
He could have been moving it
for someone else.

22:01.532 --> 22:03.799
Sir, if this transaction
was somehow responsible

22:03.833 --> 22:05.473
for Cordero's death
and we can't track it,

22:05.501 --> 22:09.171
then we may never be able
to find his killer.

22:09.205 --> 22:12.641
There may be another way.

22:15.111 --> 22:16.078
$25 million?

22:16.112 --> 22:17.346
That's right.

22:17.380 --> 22:19.080
And your informant went
to a great deal of trouble

22:19.114 --> 22:20.181
to keep it secret.

22:20.215 --> 22:22.517
And you have no idea
where the money came from?

22:22.552 --> 22:26.087
No, but odds are
it's what got him killed.

22:26.121 --> 22:28.790
Elizabeth, if you know
anything about this...

22:28.825 --> 22:31.392
Of course I don't know
anything about this.

22:32.962 --> 22:34.529
You don't believe me.

22:34.564 --> 22:36.297
Do you blame me?

22:36.332 --> 22:37.531
I didn't know.

22:37.566 --> 22:39.567
And given the lengths he went
to hide the transaction,

22:39.601 --> 22:40.962
he clearly didn't want me to know.

22:40.970 --> 22:42.437
Okay, fine.

22:42.471 --> 22:43.604
Then I'm gonna need access

22:43.638 --> 22:45.273
to Peter Cordero's wire recordings.

22:45.307 --> 22:46.474
For what?

22:46.508 --> 22:47.741
Because there may be
something on those tapes

22:47.776 --> 22:49.444
that's relevant to his murder.

22:49.478 --> 22:51.212
We went through them. If there was
anything on there, we would have heard it.

22:51.246 --> 22:53.146
Not if you weren't listening for it.

22:55.350 --> 22:57.551
I'm sorry, Victoria,
but those wire recordings

22:57.586 --> 23:00.120
are a privileged part
of a confidential investigation.

23:00.154 --> 23:01.622
I can't give you access.

23:01.656 --> 23:02.857
"Can't" or "won't"?

23:02.891 --> 23:05.593
Do you think I'm blind?

23:05.627 --> 23:07.962
Bringing down someone as big as Berman,

23:07.996 --> 23:09.329
you'd be able to write your own ticket.

23:09.364 --> 23:11.431
The Mayor's Office, Attorney General...

23:11.466 --> 23:13.467
everything you always dreamed of.

23:13.501 --> 23:16.303
But you need Cordero's testimony,

23:16.337 --> 23:18.805
and if he was involved in anything dirty

23:18.839 --> 23:20.207
while acting as a witness,

23:20.241 --> 23:21.875
it'd jeopardize your whole case.

23:21.909 --> 23:23.377
That's why you won't
give us those tapes...

23:23.411 --> 23:25.545
because you're afraid
of what we might find.

23:25.579 --> 23:28.114
Taking down a shark like Berman
would send a signal

23:28.148 --> 23:30.984
to every fraudulent actor
in the financial market.

23:31.018 --> 23:33.219
<i>I</i> have to think about the greater good.

23:33.253 --> 23:34.574
Oh, is that what you tell yourself

23:34.588 --> 23:35.688
so you can sleep at night?

23:39.393 --> 23:41.160
You could never play the game,
could you?

23:41.194 --> 23:43.896
It's why you're stuck behind a desk

23:43.930 --> 23:46.065
instead of running
the entire force down at 1 P.P.

23:46.099 --> 23:49.201
I am not <i>stuck</i> anywhere.

23:49.236 --> 23:51.603
And I will never, never apologize

23:51.638 --> 23:53.278
for doing my job
to the letter of the law.

23:55.375 --> 23:58.243
Now, I'm gonna need
those wire recordings.

23:58.277 --> 24:00.646
Or do I have to go over your head?

24:09.188 --> 24:11.108
Anything that you find,
you bring it to me first.

24:11.123 --> 24:13.391
Do you understand?

24:13.426 --> 24:15.293
I will not have you screw up

24:15.327 --> 24:17.328
another one of my investigations.

24:24.636 --> 24:26.304
Let's not put her on the list.

24:26.338 --> 24:28.506
Yeah.

24:36.414 --> 24:38.082
I feel bad for Gates.

24:39.350 --> 24:41.218
My sisters could never work together.

24:41.252 --> 24:43.754
I tell you, when the two of them
went at it... whoo!

24:43.789 --> 24:45.322
I wouldn't mind
going at it with Gates' sister.

24:45.356 --> 24:46.490
Oh, yeah?

24:46.524 --> 24:48.484
How'd you like having Gates
as your sister-in-law?

24:51.196 --> 24:52.296
What?

24:52.330 --> 24:54.498
I think I got something.

24:54.532 --> 24:57.267
So, on March 21st, Peter Cordero's wire

24:57.302 --> 24:59.769
picked up a phone call from Hector Nunez

24:59.804 --> 25:01.738
to confirm that the transfer was done.

25:01.772 --> 25:04.207
The call came in at 9:25 A.M.

25:04.241 --> 25:05.641
That's pretty much what Hector said.

25:05.643 --> 25:08.111
Yeah, but listen to the next
two calls that Peter makes.

25:11.015 --> 25:12.616
He's saying, "I'm calling
on behalf of Armando Garcia."

25:12.650 --> 25:14.618
"I want to make sure
that his money was received."

25:14.652 --> 25:16.152
"Can you confirm the amount?"

25:17.438 --> 25:19.198
Then he says, "thank you,"
and then hangs up.

25:19.223 --> 25:20.623
Who's Armando Garcia?

25:20.657 --> 25:21.790
I checked with JP Harding,

25:21.825 --> 25:23.626
but they don't have
any clients by that name.

25:23.660 --> 25:25.794
So it wasn't company business?

25:25.829 --> 25:27.150
No. Now listen to the second call.

25:28.999 --> 25:30.699
<i>Is he in?</i>
<i>It's Peter Cordero calling.</i>

25:30.734 --> 25:33.102
<i>Hey, everything's taken care of,</i>

25:33.137 --> 25:35.171
<i>but we're running out of time.</i>

25:35.205 --> 25:37.873
<i>We need to get this done</i>
<i>in the next couple days.</i>

25:37.907 --> 25:39.775
<i>Is that gonna be a problem?</i>

25:41.477 --> 25:42.444
<i>Good.</i>

25:42.478 --> 25:43.846
"Everything's taken care of"...

25:43.880 --> 25:46.381
that must be about the $25 million.

25:46.415 --> 25:48.884
But what exactly was getting
done in the next couple of days?

25:48.918 --> 25:50.452
And how did it get him killed?

25:50.486 --> 25:51.820
We need to find Armando Garcia.

25:51.855 --> 25:54.022
Yeah. Unfortunately,
it's a pretty common name.

25:54.056 --> 25:56.057
There are hundreds of Armando
Garcias in the U.S. alone.

25:56.091 --> 25:57.325
It's gonna be hard to narrow it down.

25:57.360 --> 25:59.727
Unless we can find out
who he was calling.

25:59.762 --> 26:01.763
At 9:25, Peter would have been at work.

26:01.797 --> 26:03.698
He would've made those
phone calls from his desk phone.

26:03.732 --> 26:05.093
If we can get those phone records,

26:05.100 --> 26:06.780
they could tell us
what he was involved in.

26:07.537 --> 26:08.936
I'll put in for a warrant.

26:08.971 --> 26:10.872
Hopefully, we'll get it by morning.

26:10.906 --> 26:13.875
You know, I was thinking
about Gates' sister,

26:13.909 --> 26:15.877
and it got me wondering...

26:15.911 --> 26:17.745
do you have any family
I don't know about?

26:17.780 --> 26:19.480
I don't think so.

26:19.514 --> 26:22.917
Good. Because this
"intimate wedding" of ours...

26:22.951 --> 26:24.886
Oh, no. You too?

26:24.920 --> 26:26.820
- How bad is yours?
- I've got over 100.

26:26.854 --> 26:30.191
I'm at 300 over that.

26:30.225 --> 26:32.226
400?!

26:32.260 --> 26:34.495
Well, to be fair, I am world-famous...

26:34.529 --> 26:35.929
...ish.

26:35.963 --> 26:36.963
Uh, look, it's a first draft.

26:36.998 --> 26:38.098
It just needs some editing.

26:38.132 --> 26:40.334
Brutal, ruthless editing.

26:40.368 --> 26:42.436
Castle, Michael Connelly?

26:42.470 --> 26:44.370
You haven't seen him in over a year.

26:44.405 --> 26:47.040
Do you not remember what
he wrote about your last book?

26:47.075 --> 26:48.842
No. I think we got our first edit.

26:48.876 --> 26:50.443
Uh, well, I have to invite Connelly,

26:50.477 --> 26:52.245
because if he finds out

26:52.279 --> 26:53.446
that Jonathan Kellerman made the cut...

26:53.480 --> 26:54.715
and I have to invite Kellerman

26:54.749 --> 26:56.382
because I have to invite
Wes Craven and Stephen King.

26:56.417 --> 26:57.817
Yeah, but we got to start somewhere.

26:57.819 --> 26:59.952
Well, I think I know where.

26:59.986 --> 27:01.120
Aunt Theresa?

27:01.154 --> 27:02.388
Really?

27:02.423 --> 27:04.224
After what she posted
about me on Facebook?

27:04.258 --> 27:05.525
She took it down.

27:05.559 --> 27:07.293
Fine.

27:07.328 --> 27:08.361
What are we gonna do?

27:08.395 --> 27:10.196
We can't have 500 people at the wedding.

27:10.231 --> 27:12.198
Hello, you two.

27:12.233 --> 27:16.135
Ah, help has arrived in the form
of a neutral third party.

27:16.169 --> 27:18.470
Someone who was born
to be brutal and ruthless.

27:18.504 --> 27:19.839
Thank you. Thank you.

27:19.873 --> 27:21.273
Aha!

27:21.307 --> 27:24.610
Oh, still working
on the invite list, I see.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.411
Yes, actually.
And would you mind joining us?

27:26.446 --> 27:28.080
Love to.

27:28.115 --> 27:29.615
Let me get <i>my</i> list.

27:29.649 --> 27:33.418
Oh, you know, I had no idea how
many people I needed to invite

27:33.453 --> 27:34.986
until I wrote them all down.

27:35.020 --> 27:36.121
Mm.

28:37.451 --> 28:38.611
Good news.

28:38.619 --> 28:41.087
I crossed-referenced
my mother's list with my list.

28:41.121 --> 28:42.722
We have three names in common.

28:42.756 --> 28:45.696
Wow, three names. That's... great.

28:45.712 --> 28:48.998
That takes us from, what, 585 to 582?

28:49.014 --> 28:51.115
There's got to be
a better way to cut this down.

28:51.150 --> 28:52.983
Ryan, you guys kept your wedding small.

28:53.018 --> 28:54.519
What was it... like 100 people?

28:54.553 --> 28:56.054
Yeah, that's all we could afford.

28:56.088 --> 28:58.389
How did you contain the list?

28:59.691 --> 29:01.331
I have a lot of relatives
who hate me now.

29:02.226 --> 29:06.129
So, the warrant on Cordero's
phone finally came through.

29:06.164 --> 29:07.698
Whoever this Armando Garcia is,

29:07.732 --> 29:08.899
it has something to do with Venezuela.

29:08.934 --> 29:11.101
That's where Peter was from.

29:11.135 --> 29:12.703
Yeah, that first call
confirming the $25 million?

29:12.737 --> 29:14.271
It was made to a bank in Venezuela.

29:14.305 --> 29:16.173
The second call
was to the Venezuela Consulate

29:16.207 --> 29:17.507
right here in the city.

29:17.542 --> 29:18.675
It was the direct line
of a senior official there...

29:18.709 --> 29:21.144
a Luis Delgado.

29:22.313 --> 29:25.182
Clandestine wire transfers,

29:25.216 --> 29:27.417
a high-ranking consulate official,

29:27.452 --> 29:31.421
all circling around
the mysterious Armando Garcia.

29:31.456 --> 29:32.556
What was Cordero doing?

29:32.590 --> 29:34.657
I don't know,
but I can't wait to find out.

29:34.692 --> 29:38.595
Swiss bank accounts,
secret money transfers...

29:38.629 --> 29:41.397
it's got international intrigue
written all over it.

29:41.431 --> 29:44.467
It was just a simple passport request.

29:44.501 --> 29:46.268
A passport request?

29:46.303 --> 29:47.637
Yes, that's why he called.

29:47.671 --> 29:49.305
Well, what about the money?

29:49.339 --> 29:52.475
I'm afraid I don't know
anything about any money.

29:52.509 --> 29:53.809
Really?

29:53.843 --> 29:56.004
I suppose you've never heard of
Armando Garcia, either?

29:56.012 --> 29:57.480
Armando Garcia?

29:57.514 --> 30:00.316
Yes, of course
I heard of Armando Garcia.

30:00.350 --> 30:01.517
You have?

30:01.551 --> 30:03.852
That's who I got the passport for.

30:03.886 --> 30:07.856
Wait, I thought that the
passport was for Peter Cordero.

30:07.890 --> 30:10.626
Yes, Peter Cordero, Armando Garcia...

30:11.661 --> 30:16.564
...it's the same guy.

30:16.599 --> 30:18.233
He changed his name to fit in.

30:18.267 --> 30:22.004
But his birth name was Armando Garcia.

30:23.572 --> 30:26.574
He was sending the money to himself.

30:26.609 --> 30:29.377
You said he was requesting a passport.

30:29.411 --> 30:30.978
A Venezuelan passport?

30:31.013 --> 30:32.347
Yes, of course.

30:32.381 --> 30:36.684
Cordero applied to re-establish
his Venezuelan citizenship,

30:36.718 --> 30:38.586
and we were more than happy to oblige.

30:38.621 --> 30:40.588
Under the name "Armando Garcia"?

30:40.623 --> 30:42.857
That's right. But, uh...

30:42.891 --> 30:45.960
there was something odd
about his request.

30:45.994 --> 30:48.262
He asked to pick up the passport
in Mexico City.

30:48.296 --> 30:51.932
Mexico City? Did he say why?

30:51.967 --> 30:53.934
No, but he was supposed to
get it yesterday

30:53.969 --> 30:56.170
at our embassy there.

30:56.204 --> 30:57.237
He had booked a flight

30:57.272 --> 30:58.838
from Mexico City to Caracas that night.

30:58.873 --> 31:01.041
He was running away?

31:01.075 --> 31:02.376
Not just running away,

31:02.410 --> 31:05.379
changing his identity completely.

31:05.413 --> 31:07.013
He never intended to testify.

31:07.048 --> 31:08.982
He was just stringing my sister along

31:09.016 --> 31:10.116
until he could escape.

31:10.151 --> 31:12.085
All he had to do was drive to Mexico.

31:12.119 --> 31:13.920
Once he boarded that flight to Caracas

31:13.954 --> 31:16.422
under his new identity,
paid for with a new credit card,

31:16.456 --> 31:18.058
Peter Cordero would cease to exist.

31:18.092 --> 31:19.625
Your sister would never find him.

31:19.660 --> 31:21.127
But he wasn't
gonna leave empty-handed,

31:21.162 --> 31:23.462
so he made one last desperate deal.

31:23.497 --> 31:25.298
The night he was killed,

31:25.332 --> 31:26.866
he was preparing to disappear forever

31:26.901 --> 31:28.101
along with the $25 million.

31:28.135 --> 31:31.036
You don't just conjure
$25 million out of thin air.

31:31.071 --> 31:32.438
It came from somewhere.

31:32.472 --> 31:33.972
And, given the circumstances,
nowhere legal.

31:34.007 --> 31:36.909
If you're right,
it'll destroy my sister's case.

31:36.943 --> 31:39.078
All his testimony will be tainted.

31:39.112 --> 31:40.479
Sir, what do you want us to do?

31:40.514 --> 31:43.249
Find the truth.

31:44.444 --> 31:45.884
In order to do that, we need to know

31:45.885 --> 31:47.953
where the money came from,
and there's no way to find out.

31:47.987 --> 31:50.122
Uh, maybe there is.

31:50.156 --> 31:52.424
You know that secret
Armando Garcia credit card?

31:52.458 --> 31:54.893
You know, the one he used
to buy the plane ticket?

31:54.928 --> 31:56.628
We found another charge on it

31:56.662 --> 31:59.397
for a computer station
he rented at an Internet cafe.

31:59.432 --> 32:00.799
He was there the exact same time

32:00.834 --> 32:04.135
that $25 million showed up
in his account.

32:04.169 --> 32:05.737
So whatever he was doing there
was related to the transfer.

32:05.771 --> 32:07.071
That cafe has security video.

32:07.106 --> 32:08.840
If we can get a look
at the computer screen

32:08.874 --> 32:10.074
or Peter's fingers on the keyboard,

32:10.109 --> 32:12.110
maybe we can figure out
where that money came from.

32:12.144 --> 32:13.478
And why he was killed.

32:23.688 --> 32:27.524
Sir, uh... you okay?

32:27.559 --> 32:30.594
Oh, just trying to figure out
how to tell my sister

32:30.629 --> 32:32.864
her case is compromised
without her blaming me.

32:32.898 --> 32:36.433
Why would she blame you
when you're just doing you job?

32:36.468 --> 32:38.769
There's a history.

32:38.803 --> 32:40.638
Mm.

32:40.672 --> 32:43.474
1998.

32:43.508 --> 32:46.443
I had just been made
head of Internal Affairs.

32:46.478 --> 32:48.845
Elizabeth was in the D.A.'s office.

32:48.880 --> 32:52.115
We called ourselves "the dynamic duo."

32:52.150 --> 32:54.617
At the time, Elizabeth was closing in

32:54.652 --> 32:57.254
on a heroin ring in East New York,

32:57.288 --> 32:59.923
and they had an undercover inside.

32:59.957 --> 33:02.993
His testimony was key
to the case, but...

33:03.027 --> 33:04.861
He was dirty?

33:04.896 --> 33:07.497
He skimmed a few eight balls
off the very bust

33:07.531 --> 33:09.799
Elizabeth was building her case around.

33:09.833 --> 33:12.635
And when my office
caught him re-selling it,

33:12.670 --> 33:15.871
she came to me,
begged me not to file charges,

33:15.906 --> 33:18.641
asked me to think of the greater good.

33:21.011 --> 33:25.281
I did my job that day, too.

33:26.749 --> 33:30.219
Hasn't been the same between us since.

33:33.523 --> 33:35.291
Security video is in.

33:37.227 --> 33:39.594
There's Cordero.

33:39.629 --> 33:41.297
But the angle
is over the monitor.

33:41.331 --> 33:43.365
- We can't see the screen.
- Or the keyboard.

33:43.399 --> 33:44.960
There's no way to tell what he's doing.

33:46.936 --> 33:48.257
Wait a minute. Wait. Who is that?

33:50.005 --> 33:52.040
Take a look at the time code.

33:52.074 --> 33:54.042
It's right around the moment

33:54.076 --> 33:57.178
the $25 million got into
Cordero's Swiss bank account.

33:59.081 --> 34:01.282
It's him. He transferred
the money to Cordero.

34:01.317 --> 34:04.219
A covert transfer from
an untraceable I.P. address,

34:04.253 --> 34:05.854
paid for under an alias.

34:05.888 --> 34:07.255
These people took extraordinary measures

34:07.289 --> 34:09.324
to keep from being discovered.

34:09.358 --> 34:11.025
Zoom in.

34:11.693 --> 34:13.728
Freeze it.

34:13.762 --> 34:16.263
Wait. That's Cordero's boss.
That's Jamie Berman.

34:16.297 --> 34:19.132
Why would Berman secretly pay
Cordero $25 million?

34:19.167 --> 34:20.967
Only one reason.

34:21.002 --> 34:22.034
Cordero must have told Berman

34:22.070 --> 34:23.504
about the U.S. Attorney's investigation.

34:23.538 --> 34:26.723
And Berman was paying him
to throw the case.

34:36.938 --> 34:38.779
If Berman was paying Cordero
to throw the case,

34:38.804 --> 34:41.726
then the recordings
from his wire were all lies.

34:41.750 --> 34:42.817
Berman was feeding

34:42.851 --> 34:44.985
the U.S. Attorney's Office
false evidence.

34:45.020 --> 34:47.454
And if Elizabeth
was building her case on that,

34:47.487 --> 34:49.857
she would have been torn apart
by the defense.

34:49.891 --> 34:51.291
Keeping her out of Berman's business

34:51.326 --> 34:53.928
for quite a while, if not forever.

34:53.962 --> 34:56.463
All this time, my sister thought
she was taking down Berman

34:56.496 --> 34:58.365
when he was really trying
to take down <i>her.</i>

34:58.399 --> 35:00.100
The one thing
it doesn't explain, though,

35:00.134 --> 35:02.035
is why Cordero was killed.

35:02.069 --> 35:03.870
Berman's up to his eyeballs in this.

35:03.904 --> 35:06.240
You bring him in here
and find out what he knows.

35:06.274 --> 35:08.007
Yes, sir.

35:10.511 --> 35:12.979
I'm afraid
you're mistaken, detective.

35:13.013 --> 35:15.715
I didn't transfer any money
to Mr. Cordero,

35:15.750 --> 35:19.052
certainly not $25 million.

35:19.086 --> 35:20.686
And yet, the moment
that you press that button,

35:20.721 --> 35:22.956
$25 million showed up
in Cordero's account.

35:22.990 --> 35:25.792
You have no evidence that
account belongs to Mr. Cordero,

35:25.826 --> 35:28.795
just as you have no evidence
that money came from my client.

35:28.829 --> 35:31.597
Then why were you with him
in that Internet cafe?

35:31.632 --> 35:32.998
They have good coffee.

35:33.032 --> 35:35.834
I think there's a reason
why you went out of you way

35:35.869 --> 35:37.303
to keep that transfer a secret.

35:37.337 --> 35:39.472
I think Cordero told you
that he was being forced

35:39.506 --> 35:41.440
to be an informant
for the U.S. Attorney.

35:41.475 --> 35:44.176
And knowing that he would never
be able to work again,

35:44.210 --> 35:45.811
he struck a deal with you.

35:45.845 --> 35:49.281
$25 million in exchange
for providing false evidence

35:49.315 --> 35:51.616
to undermine the investigation.

35:51.651 --> 35:52.717
What investigation?

35:52.752 --> 35:54.386
You know exactly what investigation.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.155
And when you found out that he
wasn't gonna finish the job...

35:56.189 --> 35:58.690
that he was gonna leave town
and take your money with him...

35:58.724 --> 36:00.125
you had him killed.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.727
And then you took the wire
that you knew he was wearing

36:02.762 --> 36:04.929
to cover up any recorded
evidence of the murder.

36:04.963 --> 36:07.666
That's all wild speculation.

36:07.700 --> 36:10.669
Not to mention,
you have your facts wrong.

36:12.104 --> 36:16.574
You said Peter was wearing
his wire when he was killed.

36:16.609 --> 36:19.344
I'm afraid that's not possible.

36:19.378 --> 36:20.812
So you knew about the wire?

36:20.846 --> 36:22.286
You admit you were in on it with him.

36:22.314 --> 36:23.547
Jamie.

36:23.581 --> 36:25.549
It's not illegal to know.

36:25.583 --> 36:26.583
And I guarantee you

36:26.618 --> 36:28.419
you will never link me to that payment,

36:28.453 --> 36:30.621
so you'll never be able
to prove witness tampering.

36:30.655 --> 36:32.790
But, yeah, I knew about the wire.

36:32.825 --> 36:35.526
And Peter wasn't wearing it
when he was killed

36:35.560 --> 36:38.195
because he had already left it
for the feds

36:38.229 --> 36:40.798
at the dead drop
at Lafayette and Spring.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.700
How do you even...

36:43.935 --> 36:46.903
The walk that you took together.

36:46.938 --> 36:48.839
You were with him.

36:48.873 --> 36:51.208
I saw him go into the Mailbox door

36:51.242 --> 36:53.676
and put it into one of those boxes.

36:58.149 --> 36:59.182
Thank you for coming.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.284
Of course.

37:01.319 --> 37:02.418
There's been a break in the case?

37:02.453 --> 37:04.254
Yes, actually.

37:04.288 --> 37:05.488
New information has surfaced

37:05.522 --> 37:07.824
about Peter Cordero's murder.

37:07.859 --> 37:10.760
In fact, it seems someone
in the U.S. Attorney's Office

37:10.794 --> 37:13.329
lied about Cordero not leaving his wire

37:13.364 --> 37:15.565
at the dead drop the night of his death.

37:15.599 --> 37:16.733
No one lied.

37:16.767 --> 37:18.901
I went to the drop myself.
It wasn't there.

37:20.738 --> 37:21.738
Elizabeth?

37:24.408 --> 37:25.941
Tell her.

37:25.976 --> 37:29.912
Stefanie, if Peter
never turned in his wire,

37:29.946 --> 37:33.415
how did that day's recordings
end up on your computer?

37:33.449 --> 37:36.651
See, even though you erased them,

37:36.686 --> 37:39.922
the tech department here
was able to recover...

37:39.956 --> 37:41.257
everything.

37:41.291 --> 37:43.091
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:43.125 --> 37:45.260
Standard procedure was to turn them over

37:45.294 --> 37:47.228
for analysis the next morning.

37:47.263 --> 37:49.798
But you listened to
those tapes that night,

37:49.832 --> 37:51.566
and you heard something
you weren't supposed to,

37:51.601 --> 37:53.268
at least not until Cordero was gone.

37:55.237 --> 37:57.639
<i>I came to the U.S.
believing in the American dream.</i>

37:57.673 --> 38:01.409
<i>So I worked hard and tried to</i>
<i>be honest in a corrupt world,</i>

38:01.443 --> 38:02.743
<i>working for corrupt and greedy people,</i>

38:02.778 --> 38:05.446
<i>because I still believed.</i>

38:05.480 --> 38:07.782
<i>But when you, the U.S. Government,</i>

38:07.816 --> 38:10.618
<i>plants drugs on me,</i>
<i>threatens to destroy my future,</i>

38:10.652 --> 38:13.521
<i>all because you need someone to testify,</i>

38:13.555 --> 38:16.089
<i>how am I supposed to still believe?</i>

38:16.124 --> 38:18.959
<i>I did everything I could</i>
<i>to play by the rules,</i>

38:18.993 --> 38:20.394
<i>but no one else does.</i>

38:20.429 --> 38:23.997
<i>So by the time you hear this,</i>
<i>I'll be gone.</i>

38:28.703 --> 38:30.704
We brought in the cop
that busted Cordero.

38:30.739 --> 38:36.876
He confessed to planting
the cocaine... on your orders.

38:36.911 --> 38:38.578
Why, Stefanie?

38:40.381 --> 38:43.150
You said you needed someone
on the inside,

38:43.184 --> 38:46.954
to make the case against Berman,
for the greater good.

38:46.988 --> 38:50.323
No.
Not like this.

38:50.357 --> 38:52.325
When you heard that recording

38:52.359 --> 38:53.793
and found out Peter was leaving,

38:53.828 --> 38:55.194
you knew it would all come out.

38:55.228 --> 38:56.796
So you went to his place.

38:56.831 --> 38:59.466
I... I went to try and talk to him,
but he wouldn't listen.

38:59.500 --> 39:02.401
And then you saw his gun,

39:02.436 --> 39:05.571
and you made sure that his story
would never get out.

39:05.605 --> 39:07.206
And then you made it look like

39:07.240 --> 39:09.442
he was killed for that recording.

39:17.417 --> 39:19.852
Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle.

39:19.886 --> 39:22.354
I would like to commend you
for your exemplary work

39:22.388 --> 39:24.756
in the face of head winds
from me and my office.

39:24.791 --> 39:25.924
Oh, thank you.

39:25.959 --> 39:28.093
But, I mean, we were just
all doing our jobs,

39:28.127 --> 39:29.427
following our Captain's lead.

39:31.464 --> 39:34.199
Did you manage to track down
that $25 million?

39:34.233 --> 39:36.034
Yes, it turns out that Mr. Cordero

39:36.068 --> 39:38.870
donated a large portion of it
to rebuild his hometown...

39:38.904 --> 39:40.405
the one that was destroyed

39:40.439 --> 39:41.906
in the earthquake
that killed his parents.

39:41.940 --> 39:43.808
Are you gonna try to recover it?

39:43.842 --> 39:46.077
Well, it's very difficult
to reclaim funds

39:46.112 --> 39:47.979
once they've left the country.

39:48.014 --> 39:51.716
Think that we have better uses
for our resources.

39:51.750 --> 39:54.652
I should be going, but thank you again.

39:56.989 --> 40:00.057
What about Berman?
Do you still have a case?

40:00.091 --> 40:01.425
Well, not the one that I thought,

40:01.459 --> 40:03.260
but at least I won't embarrass
myself in court

40:03.261 --> 40:05.295
presenting evidence that's untrue.

40:05.330 --> 40:07.765
Then Berman paid
$25 million for nothing.

40:07.799 --> 40:10.067
Bet that hurt.

40:10.101 --> 40:11.502
Probably, but it's not enough.

40:11.536 --> 40:13.203
We will build our case the right way.

40:13.238 --> 40:15.539
It may take some time,
but we'll get him.

40:15.573 --> 40:17.441
Thank you, Victoria.

40:17.475 --> 40:19.076
For what?

40:19.110 --> 40:21.645
For doing your job so well.

40:24.215 --> 40:25.449
So, I know it's... it's late

40:25.483 --> 40:26.917
and you probably want to get home,

40:26.951 --> 40:29.519
but after today,
I could really use a drink...

40:30.755 --> 40:32.121
...and a sister.

40:33.691 --> 40:35.491
Me too.

40:44.268 --> 40:46.936
You know, in the end,
Gates' sister wasn't that bad.

40:46.970 --> 40:48.871
Does that mean we have
to invite her to the wedding?

40:48.905 --> 40:51.474
Yeah, what about that... our lists?

40:51.508 --> 40:53.042
Castle, we can't have
that many people coming.

40:53.077 --> 40:54.843
Agreed. So, what do we do?

40:54.878 --> 40:56.045
I think we have to decide

40:56.080 --> 40:58.047
<i>why</i> we're actually having this wedding.

40:58.082 --> 40:59.315
I mean, are we doing this

40:59.349 --> 41:01.083
<i>not</i> to insult hundreds of people

41:01.117 --> 41:02.651
or are we doing this for us?

41:02.686 --> 41:04.486
Well, for us.

41:04.520 --> 41:06.321
Well, then, why don't we
just take a minute

41:06.355 --> 41:08.190
and write down the names
of all the people

41:08.224 --> 41:10.926
that absolutely, positively
have to be there,

41:10.961 --> 41:13.261
no matter what, to make us happy?

41:13.296 --> 41:14.496
One minute.

41:14.530 --> 41:15.764
Yeah.

41:15.799 --> 41:18.200
That's not much time.
What if we forget someone?

41:18.234 --> 41:20.602
Then they shouldn't have been
invited in the first place.

41:22.605 --> 41:23.572
Let's do it.

41:23.606 --> 41:25.273
Okay.

41:25.308 --> 41:27.875
All right.

41:27.910 --> 41:29.877
- Are we ready?
- Yep.

41:29.912 --> 41:31.746
One minute.

41:31.780 --> 41:33.181
And go.

41:35.985 --> 41:38.052
You stopped writing.

41:38.087 --> 41:41.122
So did you.

41:52.400 --> 41:53.700
Of course...

41:53.735 --> 41:57.137
I'm going to have to invite
my mother and Alexis.

41:57.171 --> 41:59.572
- Yeah, and my dad and aunt Theresa.
- Right.

41:59.607 --> 42:02.408
Espo and Ryan, who will bring Jenny.

42:02.443 --> 42:03.576
Mm-hmm. Lanie.

42:03.611 --> 42:04.977
Lanie.

42:05.012 --> 42:06.912
I'm gonna have to invite
the poker group.

42:06.947 --> 42:09.382
- Yeah, Maddie.
- Gates.

42:09.416 --> 42:11.618
Ooh! And Gates' family.
