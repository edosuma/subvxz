WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:06.901
Wow! Late every day
this week.

00:06.969 --> 00:08.766
We signed Cece up
for this daycare,

00:08.838 --> 00:10.032
and it's on
the other side
of town.

00:10.106 --> 00:12.131
The traffic...
Why didn't I
think of this before?

00:12.208 --> 00:14.608
Did you know
that there is
a daycare center

00:14.677 --> 00:16.338
opening right here
in this building?

00:16.813 --> 00:17.837
Is there really?

00:18.147 --> 00:21.048
Now that I own the building,
I'm looking for new
sources of revenue.

00:21.117 --> 00:22.914
And a daycare center?

00:28.558 --> 00:29.820
Well, I guess it's
not an evil idea.

00:29.892 --> 00:34.226
It's just a regular idea,
but there's no good
laugh for a regular idea.

00:35.665 --> 00:37.997
Welcome to the
Sesame Avenue
Daycare Center

00:38.067 --> 00:40.058
for infants
and toddlers.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.102
You remember
my cousin Mose?

00:45.174 --> 00:46.402
Welcome, children.

00:46.476 --> 00:48.068
Were you painting
in the dark?

00:48.778 --> 00:50.405
Wait, is this your
place, Dwight?

00:50.613 --> 00:52.808
DWIGHT: No, no,
I like to think of it
as the kids' place.

00:52.882 --> 00:54.008
Would you like a tour?

00:54.550 --> 00:55.539
I don't think we
really need it...

00:55.618 --> 00:56.778
Ooh, let's take
the tour, Pam.

00:56.853 --> 00:57.979
Yeah.
Come on.

00:59.088 --> 01:02.524
Here is the language
skills and cognitive
development area.

01:02.592 --> 01:05.083
These are
English letters.

01:05.461 --> 01:07.292
I see you found
our magical
toy box, Jim.

01:07.363 --> 01:09.263
These are actually
forks and knives
from the break room.

01:09.532 --> 01:12.365
Jim, to you and me,
maybe. But, come on.

01:12.435 --> 01:14.266
To a child's imagination,
that's Mr. Fork,

01:14.337 --> 01:16.737
and Lieutenant Knife
and Miss Fork.

01:16.973 --> 01:18.873
And a soy sauce packet.

01:21.844 --> 01:23.675
That shouldn't
have been in there.
I'm embarrassed.

01:23.746 --> 01:24.906
Don't beat yourself up.

01:24.981 --> 01:27.711
We come fully equipped
with a restroom,

01:27.784 --> 01:29.649
feeding trough,
play bucket,

01:29.986 --> 01:31.783
and room for a plant,
in success.

01:31.854 --> 01:33.014
Who will be watching
the children?

01:33.089 --> 01:35.649
No one. The door
locks from the outside.
Escape is impossible.

01:35.858 --> 01:37.291
Prove it.

01:37.360 --> 01:39.487
What... No.
We're gonna
head outside.

01:39.562 --> 01:41.928
Just give it a whirl.
I just wanna see
how it works.

01:41.998 --> 01:43.522
No, no, no, I...
But I'll tell you this.

01:43.599 --> 01:46.363
If this works out,
I think we're
looking real good.

01:46.436 --> 01:48.734
I promise you,
that door locks.

02:27.543 --> 02:29.875
What's something you did...
This is the worst!
This is the worst!

02:29.946 --> 02:32.005
You are the worst.
I hate looking
at your face.

02:32.081 --> 02:33.412
I wanna smash it!

02:33.483 --> 02:35.849
MICHAEL: <i>Okay,</i>
<i>you know what?</i>
I <i>made a mistake.</i>

02:35.918 --> 02:37.545
I committed
corporate punishment.

02:37.620 --> 02:39.451
<i>My bad.</i>

02:39.522 --> 02:41.956
<i>It's over, it's done.</i>

02:42.024 --> 02:48.190
But, my punishment
is worse than hell.

02:48.698 --> 02:51.064
Michael's been
assigned six hours
of mandatory counseling

02:51.167 --> 02:52.327
with a trained professional.

02:52.535 --> 02:54.594
I <i>actually have</i>
<i>a degree in social work.</i>

02:54.704 --> 02:58.037
I <i>mean,</i> I <i>know a lot</i>
<i>of people would just ask</i>
<i>a few standard questions</i>

02:58.107 --> 02:59.665
<i>and tick off</i>
<i>a few boxes,</i>

03:00.376 --> 03:03.004
but I've got a chance
to do some good here.

03:03.079 --> 03:06.014
I know what
you wanna ask me.

03:06.082 --> 03:07.515
"Did your mom ever
see you naked?"

03:07.750 --> 03:09.843
We can do this
with more privacy.

03:10.186 --> 03:11.414
So you can molest me?

03:11.654 --> 03:13.144
Okay. I don't think so.

03:13.856 --> 03:14.948
We're gonna leave
the blinds open,

03:15.024 --> 03:17.356
so everybody
can see what a big
failure you are.

03:21.764 --> 03:23.197
That's the key.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.331
Boycott the Steamtown Mall!

03:26.969 --> 03:28.493
Everyone, you heard me.

03:28.571 --> 03:31.199
Cancel all your businesses
with the Steamtown Mall!

03:31.274 --> 03:33.435
The mall itself,
or the stores
in the mall?

03:33.509 --> 03:35.977
All of it! The mall,
the stores, the kiosks.

03:36.045 --> 03:37.410
America's one big mall.

03:37.513 --> 03:38.537
Did something
happen, Dwight?

03:38.614 --> 03:40.741
Yeah, something happened.
Oh, yeah.

03:40.816 --> 03:42.147
Something happened, Jim.

03:42.218 --> 03:43.207
Well, tell us what it is.

03:43.286 --> 03:46.483
I mean, it'll help
to get some context
so we can get on board.

03:46.556 --> 03:47.614
You don't wanna know.

03:49.125 --> 03:52.253
I'd like you to imagine
a place where you
feel very peaceful.

03:53.029 --> 03:56.260
For me, it's the walk
from the yogurt shop
to my car,

03:56.332 --> 03:58.994
after I drop my daughter off
on Sunday afternoons.

04:03.406 --> 04:06.000
I'm glad
Michael's getting help.

04:06.075 --> 04:08.873
He has a lot of issues
and he's stupid.

04:08.945 --> 04:13.848
Look, I'm not gonna
tell you that we
have lower prices.

04:13.916 --> 04:16.851
Is price something
that is important to you?

04:18.353 --> 04:21.289
Okay, well,
let me know if
anything changes.

04:24.827 --> 04:25.851
Pam?

04:27.463 --> 04:29.226
I can't do this.

04:29.298 --> 04:32.995
I don't have this sales
gene or whatever it is.

04:34.870 --> 04:36.428
Tell me everything's
gonna be okay.

04:37.073 --> 04:38.597
Everything's gonna
be okay.

04:39.675 --> 04:41.142
Tell me
I'm good at sales.

04:41.944 --> 04:44.674
You're good...
You're good at sales.

04:45.848 --> 04:47.645
The unfair thing
about working in sales

04:47.717 --> 04:50.117
is that your salary is
almost all commission.

04:50.186 --> 04:53.383
So if you suck
at sales, you make
almost no money.

04:56.859 --> 04:58.690
I guess that's fair.

04:58.794 --> 05:00.261
Dwight.

05:00.329 --> 05:01.318
What?

05:01.397 --> 05:04.332
Did you call all my
clients at the mall

05:04.400 --> 05:10.498
and cancel all my business
while using the "F" word?

05:10.573 --> 05:11.767
Yes, I did.

05:11.841 --> 05:14.332
And I'm gonna
do the same with
all of your clients.

05:14.410 --> 05:15.638
No, you will not.

05:15.711 --> 05:18.771
Oh, yes, I will.
That mall is corrupt.

05:18.848 --> 05:20.076
Okay, they're appearancist!

05:20.149 --> 05:22.549
Okay, Dwight,
we can't do that.

05:22.618 --> 05:24.085
So why don't you
just tell us
what happened?

05:24.186 --> 05:25.414
Yeah. What happened,
Dwight?

05:25.888 --> 05:26.980
JIM: Okay?

05:29.592 --> 05:34.188
You guys know me.
You know that I'm not
one for fancy things.

05:34.263 --> 05:35.890
But there was
this one thing.

05:35.965 --> 05:38.160
It was in a fancy store,
and it caught
the corner of my eye

05:38.234 --> 05:40.862
when I took Mose
down to the mall

05:40.936 --> 05:42.904
to get his blood
pressure at the Rite Aid.

05:43.005 --> 05:45.872
And I thought, "You know,
maybe I deserve this."

05:45.941 --> 05:48.842
You know,
I've had a great
crop yield this fall.

05:48.911 --> 05:50.037
So what happened?

05:50.112 --> 05:52.080
I went to the store
and I pressed the buzzer,

05:52.148 --> 05:54.981
and they looked right at me,
and then they looked away.

05:55.251 --> 05:57.583
And then I pressed
the buzzer again,

05:57.653 --> 06:01.316
and they started
taking pictures of me
with their mobile phones.

06:01.824 --> 06:03.451
I guess I'm not
the kind of guy

06:03.526 --> 06:06.324
that's good enough
for precious heirlooms.

06:06.395 --> 06:08.260
You know what, Dwight?
You need to go back there,

06:08.330 --> 06:10.355
and you need to
<i>Pretty Woman</i>
their asses.

06:10.433 --> 06:12.628
We should start
our own mall.
Yeah!

06:12.702 --> 06:14.966
Wait, wait, wait.
Actually, that's
a really good idea, Kelly.

06:15.037 --> 06:16.129
What did I say?

06:16.205 --> 06:19.106
I talk a lot,
so I've learned to
just tune myself out.

06:19.175 --> 06:20.369
Dwight,
how about this?

06:20.443 --> 06:21.637
Instead of a boycott,

06:21.711 --> 06:24.646
you and I, together,
go down to that store

06:24.714 --> 06:26.875
and we teach those
snobs a lesson.

06:26.949 --> 06:31.477
No, you and I, and I.

06:32.154 --> 06:34.452
I'm gonna
come with you.
Okay.

06:35.157 --> 06:36.715
Good. All right.

06:36.792 --> 06:38.657
Did you assume
that I would
automatically side

06:38.728 --> 06:41.128
with the rich,
snobby shop owner?

06:43.666 --> 06:45.156
How about now?

06:48.938 --> 06:50.428
How about now?

06:52.975 --> 06:54.465
How about now?

06:56.946 --> 06:58.504
How about now?

06:58.581 --> 07:00.742
What's your
favorite flavor of...

07:00.816 --> 07:02.078
One hour.
What?

07:02.151 --> 07:04.517
One hour.
We've done one hour.

07:04.587 --> 07:06.919
Let's just speed this up.

07:06.989 --> 07:09.583
Okay, keep it moving.
I wanna do all
six hours today.

07:09.658 --> 07:11.649
Look, I can't
count the hour
if you don't talk.

07:11.727 --> 07:13.786
No, no, no. No.

07:14.029 --> 07:17.556
I know my rights,
all I had to do is
sit here for six hours.

07:17.633 --> 07:18.691
Do my time.

07:18.768 --> 07:20.292
Michael, it's up to me
to check off the boxes,

07:20.369 --> 07:22.303
and I can't do that
unless I honestly...
Do you know how...

07:22.371 --> 07:24.566
Do you have
any idea how angry
that is making me?

07:24.640 --> 07:26.198
Tell me.

07:27.543 --> 07:30.512
I think we might be
about to maybe really
get somewhere.

07:30.913 --> 07:33.939
Yes, I will.
I will talk all right.

07:34.016 --> 07:36.507
Be careful what
you wish for, Toby.

07:38.020 --> 07:39.749
Apparently, there's
a famous Hollywood movie

07:39.855 --> 07:42.847
from the 1980s,
<i>Beautiful Girl.</i>

07:42.925 --> 07:44.859
<i>Pretty Woman.</i>

07:44.927 --> 07:46.861
<i>Pretty Woman.</i>
Apparently, it's one of the

07:46.929 --> 07:49.420
best revenge stories
of all time,

07:49.498 --> 07:53.457
in which this sex worker,
who is the protagonist...

07:53.536 --> 07:55.731
That can't be right.
Andy, how does it...
JIM: No, no, no.

07:55.805 --> 07:57.102
What?
I wanna hear you tell it.

07:57.173 --> 07:58.936
Okay.

07:59.008 --> 08:01.442
The sex worker
is denied service
at a fancy store

08:01.510 --> 08:03.341
because she does
not look wealthy.

08:03.412 --> 08:05.880
She later returns,
dressed in all
the trappings

08:05.948 --> 08:07.040
of extravagant wealth,

08:07.116 --> 08:08.174
but instead
of shopping...

08:08.250 --> 08:09.239
Julia Roberts
goes in the store,

08:09.318 --> 08:10.478
she's like,
"I was in here yesterday,

08:10.553 --> 08:11.747
"and you people
wouldn't help me."

08:11.821 --> 08:13.152
And the shop girl
goes, "Oh."

08:13.222 --> 08:16.453
And then Julia Roberts goes,
"You girls work on commission,
right?"

08:16.525 --> 08:18.015
And the girl's
like, "Yeah."

08:18.093 --> 08:19.082
And Julia Roberts goes...

08:19.161 --> 08:21.186
"Big mistake. Huge."

08:22.598 --> 08:24.498
I was telling...
I was telling that.

08:24.567 --> 08:27.297
...paper supplies
and ink cartridges
to go with that?

08:27.369 --> 08:29.360
Okay, sure.

08:29.438 --> 08:30.996
Who can I speak
to in this office

08:31.073 --> 08:32.734
about saving on
window treatments?

08:33.509 --> 08:34.498
I don't know.

08:34.577 --> 08:36.977
Is one of you
the office
administrator?

08:39.448 --> 08:40.539
I am.

08:42.684 --> 08:44.174
I'm the office
administrator!

08:44.520 --> 08:45.987
Can I show you
a few samples?

08:46.388 --> 08:49.755
We're not interested.
We're not interested
at all.

08:52.962 --> 08:54.953
There are a few ways
to get promoted.

08:55.030 --> 08:58.022
One is to wait
for an opening
and apply for it.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.227
That's the main way.

09:00.302 --> 09:01.769
But this could work.

09:02.171 --> 09:03.832
Toby, can I really
tell you anything?

09:04.106 --> 09:05.266
Of course.

09:05.875 --> 09:08.537
Well, the other night,
I was sitting
at the table,

09:08.611 --> 09:10.670
eating my penis...

09:10.746 --> 09:11.940
I mean peas.

09:13.415 --> 09:14.575
That was weird.

09:14.984 --> 09:16.383
Ah, that's weird.

09:16.452 --> 09:19.615
I think it all
stems from the fact
that I was...

09:21.757 --> 09:23.224
I was probed.

09:24.059 --> 09:26.823
By an alien life force.
An ALF.

09:28.731 --> 09:30.130
ALF.

09:30.599 --> 09:33.500
You know, I might
have actually been
probed by ALF.

09:34.436 --> 09:37.132
You might think
he's a puppet.

09:37.206 --> 09:40.107
You never see the lower half,
but there's a lower half.

09:40.209 --> 09:41.699
Office administrator.

09:41.777 --> 09:43.745
So when did
this happen?

09:44.546 --> 09:46.138
A few months ago.

09:46.215 --> 09:48.479
I was talking to
someone at corporate,

09:48.550 --> 09:49.744
who isn't there anymore.
Mmm-hmm.

09:49.818 --> 09:53.151
And I think
the paperwork just got
lost in the shuffle.

09:53.322 --> 09:54.584
Can you believe that?
Typical.

09:54.657 --> 09:56.454
Yeah, totally.
Well, congrats.

09:56.525 --> 10:00.291
Thanks, yeah.
So, I'm just gonna take care
of stuff around the office

10:00.362 --> 10:02.762
and get paid
a reasonable salary.
We need that, right?

10:02.831 --> 10:03.855
Totally. That's great.

10:03.933 --> 10:05.195
I get paid
$40,000 a year.

10:05.267 --> 10:06.325
Great.

10:06.402 --> 10:07.994
Maybe $50,000.
$50,000?

10:08.103 --> 10:09.832
No, not $50,000.

10:09.905 --> 10:11.873
$41,000, I think.

10:11.941 --> 10:12.930
$41,000.

10:13.042 --> 10:14.100
<i>$41,500.</i>

10:14.543 --> 10:16.010
That's great.

10:20.516 --> 10:23.144
Before me
stands your coworker,
Dwight Kurt Schrute.

10:24.453 --> 10:26.182
Dwight, show them
all sides. Turn around.

10:26.255 --> 10:29.656
Now, today we need
your help turning Dwight
into a gentleman.

10:29.892 --> 10:32.884
A gentleman,
who is a rich snob,

10:32.962 --> 10:34.554
who will go into
shopping malls

10:34.630 --> 10:37.098
and drop huge
amounts of cash
on clothes.

10:37.199 --> 10:38.723
Is he still
doing this boycott?

10:38.801 --> 10:41.361
No, no, this is
instead of the
boycott. Yeah.

10:41.804 --> 10:44.364
Your shirt and tie
are disgusto-barfo.

10:44.440 --> 10:45.668
Agreed.
Really?

10:45.741 --> 10:47.504
OSCAR: Maybe something
not so monochromatic.

10:47.576 --> 10:48.634
Not so matching.

10:48.711 --> 10:51.236
Wait, less matching
to appear more rich?

10:51.680 --> 10:53.341
The glasses
are a little...

10:56.151 --> 10:57.345
I liked them.

10:57.419 --> 10:59.046
I thought they
were kind of cute.

10:59.121 --> 11:01.089
Yeah, I liked
them, too.

11:02.057 --> 11:03.081
I can't see.

11:03.158 --> 11:04.955
Say stuff like,
"Good morning,
good afternoon."

11:05.027 --> 11:06.016
People appreciate that.

11:06.128 --> 11:09.097
Wait, I see you every day.
Can I say, "Good month?"

11:09.631 --> 11:11.223
I'm telling you
how to do this, man.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.961
If someone offers
you a cocktail,

11:13.035 --> 11:15.333
accept, but keep
your wits about you.

11:15.404 --> 11:17.531
Okay.
"Please" and "thank
you" go a long way.

11:17.906 --> 11:20.966
Copy. Thank you.

11:21.310 --> 11:22.641
Thank you.

11:23.145 --> 11:25.136
Please.

11:27.750 --> 11:30.480
And I was raised
by wolves.

11:30.753 --> 11:33.745
I was <i>25</i> years old
before I saw my
first human being.

11:34.123 --> 11:36.455
Wait, is it
a full moon tonight?

11:41.897 --> 11:44.889
Come on, Michael.
These are all fake stories.

11:46.268 --> 11:48.293
Yes, yes, they are
all fake stories.

11:48.404 --> 11:51.840
What sort of twisted mind
would come up with
weird stories like that?

11:51.907 --> 11:53.204
Three hours,
we're halfway done.

12:02.284 --> 12:05.253
Hey, do you
have a second?
Yeah.

12:05.421 --> 12:07.446
Well, as I'm sure you know
for the past few months,

12:07.523 --> 12:09.047
I've been
the office administrator,

12:09.124 --> 12:10.648
since right before
you guys took over.

12:10.993 --> 12:12.187
Right, of course.

12:12.494 --> 12:14.052
And I haven't
gotten paid yet.

12:14.129 --> 12:15.255
I'm not blaming you.

12:18.033 --> 12:20.126
I just think
somebody lost
the paperwork.

12:20.202 --> 12:21.692
Oh, boy.

12:21.770 --> 12:23.704
Can you get every
department head's
signature on this

12:23.772 --> 12:24.796
so I can back
this up to corporate?

12:24.873 --> 12:27.842
Yes, absolutely,
right away.

12:29.578 --> 12:32.206
You know what, Michael?
You're right. You win.

12:32.281 --> 12:34.442
This is pointless.
We're not getting anywhere.

12:35.317 --> 12:38.980
I got a bunch of fun stuff,
in case my daughter
ever comes over.

12:39.054 --> 12:41.045
Why don't we just
run out the clock

12:41.123 --> 12:45.457
by playing games,
drawing some pictures,
talking?

12:52.601 --> 12:55.331
We present to you,
for your final comments
and approval,

12:55.404 --> 12:57.065
Dwight K. Schrute.

12:59.408 --> 13:00.773
Go get them, Dwight.

13:00.843 --> 13:01.901
Wish us luck.

13:02.644 --> 13:04.544
Thank you.
Dwight.

13:08.016 --> 13:09.415
All done.

13:09.485 --> 13:12.716
Disposable cameras
are fun, although
it does seem wasteful

13:12.788 --> 13:15.484
and you don't ever get
to see your pictures.

13:15.557 --> 13:18.082
If it's an important event
that you want to remember,

13:18.160 --> 13:19.855
I recommend
using a real camera.

13:19.928 --> 13:22.419
But I don't care
if I forget today.

13:24.133 --> 13:26.101
We could play something
more complicated
if you'd like.

13:26.168 --> 13:27.658
This is plenty
complicated.

13:27.736 --> 13:29.135
So you've played
it before?

13:29.204 --> 13:31.297
I played it once
or twice with Jeff.

13:31.640 --> 13:32.629
Who's Jeff?

13:32.708 --> 13:34.573
Jeff was my
mother's boyfriend,

13:34.643 --> 13:35.735
who she married.

13:35.978 --> 13:39.004
So, her husband
and your stepdad.

13:39.248 --> 13:40.340
Yeah.

13:40.415 --> 13:43.145
Yeah, I guess
I never thought of
it that way, though.

13:44.753 --> 13:46.812
Did you guys do
much stuff together?

13:46.889 --> 13:49.289
Yeah, you know what,
he took me to a baseball
game once,

13:49.358 --> 13:50.825
I remember.

13:50.893 --> 13:53.726
It was weird, though.
They took the pitcher
out of the game,

13:53.795 --> 13:54.819
and I felt
really bad

13:55.430 --> 13:56.863
because the pitcher
wasn't gonna be able

13:56.932 --> 13:58.024
to play with his
friends anymore.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.625
But Jeff said that
the manager was making

14:00.702 --> 14:02.966
a really good move by
taking the pitcher out.

14:03.038 --> 14:04.596
He really respected
the manager.

14:07.509 --> 14:08.976
It's working.

14:10.078 --> 14:11.545
I'm doing it.

14:16.818 --> 14:17.807
What?

14:17.886 --> 14:20.013
My place, tonight.
Wear this.

14:20.088 --> 14:21.112
Do you have your card?

14:21.190 --> 14:22.248
Yes.

14:24.793 --> 14:26.420
ANGELA: Don't forget the pipe.

14:26.495 --> 14:27.928
It's really sad
that your dog ran away,

14:27.996 --> 14:31.830
but why did it keep you
from going to the park?

14:31.900 --> 14:34.596
I was afraid I would
find him in the park
playing with another kid.

14:34.670 --> 14:35.659
Why?

14:35.737 --> 14:38.001
I guess that's why
I thought he ran away
in the first place,

14:38.073 --> 14:39.438
to find a kid
he liked better.

14:39.508 --> 14:40.532
Dogs don't do that.

14:40.609 --> 14:41.598
Right?

14:41.677 --> 14:42.769
Why would
a dog do that?

14:42.844 --> 14:43.833
I don't know.

14:43.912 --> 14:46.403
When I hear myself say it,
it just sounds ridiculous.

14:46.481 --> 14:48.972
But I never said
it out loud, so...

14:52.054 --> 14:55.717
It's very important
for you to be liked,
isn't it?

14:55.791 --> 14:59.625
Well, let's not get too...

14:59.695 --> 15:02.027
This isn't
a counseling session.

15:05.133 --> 15:06.225
Okay.

15:08.971 --> 15:10.336
You son of a gun.

15:12.441 --> 15:15.035
You son of a bitch.
Wow, okay.

15:15.110 --> 15:16.543
I'm just trying to
help you, Michael.

15:16.612 --> 15:17.977
You bitch, God!

15:18.213 --> 15:20.272
Michael.
You're very helpful,
aren't you?

15:20.349 --> 15:22.112
You try to help everybody.
I'm trying to.

15:22.184 --> 15:23.981
Do you wanna
play another game?

15:24.052 --> 15:25.178
I just wanna...
You are good.

15:25.254 --> 15:26.812
But you know what?
You can't help people.

15:26.888 --> 15:28.082
You couldn't help
your marriage.

15:28.523 --> 15:29.717
Hey...
Lose. You lose.

15:29.791 --> 15:30.780
I don't need your help.

15:31.026 --> 15:32.254
Nobody needs your help.

15:32.327 --> 15:35.421
Nobody wants it!
You can't help anybody.

15:35.530 --> 15:37.430
I don't need your help!

15:38.367 --> 15:39.959
Am I gonna
make you cry?

15:40.068 --> 15:41.535
Just fill them out
any way you want.

15:41.603 --> 15:42.968
Okay.

15:43.038 --> 15:44.767
Have Erin fax them
back to corporate.

15:44.840 --> 15:45.829
Will do.

15:45.907 --> 15:48.171
Okay, filled out. Good.

15:48.243 --> 15:50.677
Thank you, doctor.
Take two of these
and call me in the morning.

15:53.081 --> 15:54.548
PAM: Hey, Michael?

15:55.317 --> 15:58.047
About three months ago,
I was talking...

16:04.726 --> 16:06.660
PAM: <i>There are</i>
<i>a lot of one-person</i>
<i>departments here,</i>

16:06.728 --> 16:09.356
so there's a lot
of department heads.

16:09.431 --> 16:11.490
<i>But I'm off</i>
<i>to a good start.</i>

16:11.566 --> 16:16.663
<i>Oh, man, if</i> I <i>can pull</i>
<i>this off, it will be</i>
<i>the scam of</i> all <i>scams.</i>

16:17.472 --> 16:19.736
And yet,
very helpful
to everyone.

16:20.809 --> 16:22.800
So corporate got
your evaluations,

16:22.878 --> 16:24.209
and they wanted
me to double-check.

16:24.279 --> 16:26.975
Is that really how you feel
about Michael's situation?

16:27.249 --> 16:28.910
Yes.

16:28.984 --> 16:31.316
That is not how
he seemed to me.

16:32.321 --> 16:33.310
I thought
he seemed fine.

16:33.388 --> 16:35.879
You marked "severe"
in all the categories,

16:35.957 --> 16:37.822
including "at risk
for homicidal behavior."

16:41.730 --> 16:44.756
I saw a TLC show
on Kate Walsh's
home office.

16:44.833 --> 16:45.891
All corkboard.

16:45.967 --> 16:46.991
We can do that.

16:47.069 --> 16:48.400
Right in here?
Easily.

16:48.470 --> 16:50.631
Knock, knock.
Pam? Perfect.

16:51.373 --> 16:53.398
I was hoping
to talk to the
office administrator

16:53.475 --> 16:55.568
about a little office
administration problem.

16:56.278 --> 16:57.643
But of course.
Great.

16:59.881 --> 17:02.543
The problem,
unfortunately,
is about

17:02.617 --> 17:04.141
the office administrator.

17:05.587 --> 17:07.680
I have gone through
everything from the
past three years.

17:08.022 --> 17:11.015
There is nothing
that says that you're
office administrator.

17:11.827 --> 17:13.818
So weird that
there's no paperwork.

17:13.895 --> 17:15.089
At all.

17:15.830 --> 17:19.392
Although, like,
unlikely things happen
all the time.

17:19.501 --> 17:20.991
My best friend
in high school,

17:21.069 --> 17:22.695
she went to Australia,
Canberra I think,

17:22.771 --> 17:26.137
and she met this guy
who lived only two streets
away from her in America.

17:26.208 --> 17:29.006
Pam, I don't want
to accuse you
of anything.

17:29.077 --> 17:32.069
I just want everything
to be back the way
it's supposed to be.

17:33.949 --> 17:36.782
Can you just admit... Admit...

17:38.120 --> 17:39.178
Admit what?

17:39.254 --> 17:40.687
I don't want to say it.

17:47.129 --> 17:48.153
Say it.

17:48.430 --> 17:49.454
Mmm-mmm.

17:49.531 --> 17:51.726
Say that I'm lying,
or say I have the job.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.131
Make a definitive
statement, Gabe.

17:53.201 --> 17:55.692
Statements of such a nature,
while they have their place,
are overused

17:55.771 --> 17:57.500
in a competitive
business environment.

17:57.572 --> 18:00.541
Great. Well, let me know
if you need a new chair,

18:00.609 --> 18:03.009
or anything that
an office administrator
can handle.

18:04.179 --> 18:05.237
Will do.

18:08.784 --> 18:13.585
Could I get one
of those nameplates
that says "Gabe Lewis"?

18:13.889 --> 18:15.857
For sure.
Anything else?

18:17.325 --> 18:18.553
I'll get it right away.

18:20.061 --> 18:23.292
The first lesson of watching
<i>World Poker Tour</i> at 2:00 a.m.,

18:23.365 --> 18:26.459
you play the opponent,
not the cards.

18:29.438 --> 18:30.530
JIM: Is that what
we're here for?

18:30.939 --> 18:33.134
A crystal wizard.
I like it.

18:33.208 --> 18:35.802
It's a pewter wizard
holding a crystal.

18:37.679 --> 18:39.112
Wait a second.

18:39.181 --> 18:41.945
You know you can't
buy that now, right?

18:42.017 --> 18:43.541
And I can come back
and get it for you later.

18:43.618 --> 18:45.279
But I'm saying right now,
we can't do that.

18:45.353 --> 18:46.342
Right.

18:46.455 --> 18:47.922
'Cause I'm here for
one thing, revenge.

18:47.989 --> 18:49.081
That's it.
Okay.

18:49.157 --> 18:50.419
Let me know if I can
help you with anything.

18:51.793 --> 18:52.919
Excuse me, sir.

18:52.994 --> 18:54.291
Yes?

18:54.362 --> 18:57.331
I was here yesterday,
and you refused
to wait on me.

18:57.399 --> 18:59.560
I remember, yes.
I'm terribly sorry
about what happened.

18:59.634 --> 19:01.124
You work on commission,
don't you?

19:01.203 --> 19:02.636
No.
Stop, stop, stop.
Hold on one second.

19:02.737 --> 19:04.136
Did you just say
you remember him?

19:04.206 --> 19:05.195
Of course.

19:05.273 --> 19:07.673
But he looks much
less threatening now.

19:07.742 --> 19:08.731
What does that mean?

19:08.810 --> 19:10.334
We had a safety concern.

19:10.412 --> 19:12.880
We very politely
indicated that he'd
be welcomed back...

19:12.948 --> 19:14.415
Good morning.
...if he were in accordance

19:14.483 --> 19:16.075
with our dress policy.
What?

19:16.151 --> 19:18.517
But the
bloodstained hands...

19:23.158 --> 19:25.319
It was beet juice.

19:25.393 --> 19:27.418
I'm a beet farmer...
I'm very sorry.

19:27.496 --> 19:31.933
Good sir, I happened
to have been working
a very long day that day.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.491
When I came
to your fine...

19:34.569 --> 19:37.470
You are so...
I'm gonna... Okay.

19:37.539 --> 19:41.475
Listen, you can't treat...
Thank you. Good morning, sir!

19:41.543 --> 19:43.067
Okay, let's go.
Come on.

19:43.178 --> 19:45.772
You made a big
mistake! Huge!

19:47.015 --> 19:49.074
There it is.
All right.

19:51.086 --> 19:52.075
That was pretty good.

19:52.153 --> 19:53.950
Thank you.
Please. After you.

19:54.890 --> 19:56.881
I'll take the wizard.
SALESMAN: Okay.

20:00.829 --> 20:04.356
You forged them.
You forged the forms.

20:04.432 --> 20:06.900
You filled them in
and faxed them yourself.
Yes.

20:06.968 --> 20:08.595
You remember that.
Yes.

20:08.670 --> 20:11.798
But you had me
so worked up that
I made a mistake.

20:11.873 --> 20:14.808
Unless a part of you
made that mistake
on purpose.

20:14.876 --> 20:17.401
You don't make
a mistake on
purpose, Toby.

20:17.479 --> 20:18.810
Then it's no longer
a mistake.

20:21.550 --> 20:24.280
Gabe. He messed it up.

20:24.352 --> 20:25.819
He messed up
the forms, I bet.

20:27.389 --> 20:30.017
"I wanna mess everything up
so I can fix it
and keep my job.

20:32.360 --> 20:34.920
"Good thing I'm here,
'cause I do nothing.

20:34.996 --> 20:37.362
"I make everybody nervous."

20:37.999 --> 20:39.591
 Okay.

20:39.668 --> 20:40.692
That's your notebook?

20:41.536 --> 20:44.369
All right. All right.
Let's bang this out.

20:45.507 --> 20:46.735
Let's do it to it.

20:50.879 --> 20:52.540
That's the office, huh?
Mmm.

20:53.682 --> 20:55.172
Look at that.

20:55.350 --> 20:57.580
Angela's cat, yes.

20:58.386 --> 21:00.684
Why is Angela
taller than Dwight?

21:03.625 --> 21:04.990
Right. Oh.

21:05.093 --> 21:07.926
I wonder why it
feels like that.

21:07.996 --> 21:11.796
Psychiatrists
tend to be more crazy
than their patients.

21:11.866 --> 21:14.266
Therapists are whores.

21:14.336 --> 21:16.827
Psychiatry is
a narcissism machine.

21:17.772 --> 21:20.639
I learn more
from Dr. Seuss
than Dr. Freud.

21:20.709 --> 21:23.678
Earth. You don't have
to be crazy to live here.

21:23.745 --> 21:25.212
But it helps.

21:25.947 --> 21:27.812
I don't know,
just use the best one.
