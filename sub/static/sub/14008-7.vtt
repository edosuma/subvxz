Previously on damages:

00:02.183 --> 00:03.331
Josh Reston.

00:03.366 --> 00:05.074
Just got a job reporting crime
at the Manhattan observer.

00:05.141 --> 00:05.741
This is a nice place.

00:06.615 --> 00:08.313
What did you think of Alex Benjamin?

00:08.381 --> 00:09.765
She's just what you're looking for.

00:09.833 --> 00:10.886
I'm glad you like her.

00:10.954 --> 00:12.889
Patty just called and she hired me.

00:12.957 --> 00:16.221
Tobin would've needed someone he trusted
to conduct his business in the Caribbean.

00:16.289 --> 00:18.445
Mr. Zedeck, my father
told me about the money.

00:18.513 --> 00:22.363
- I need proof you can produce.
- What kind of proof?

00:22.438 --> 00:25.152
Carol, I am really sorry for your family.

00:25.220 --> 00:28.770
Ms. Marchetti?

00:28.837 --> 00:31.012
The initial M.E report
on Danielle Marchetti.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.150
She died of heart failure.

00:32.218 --> 00:33.152
Same as Louis Tobin.

00:33.220 --> 00:34.820
There's got to be a
connection between the two.

00:34.888 --> 00:37.260
Tell me the truth about
Danielle Marchetti.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.099
Louis had a child with her.

00:39.167 --> 00:39.769
Yes.

00:39.836 --> 00:42.846
I think I know who the Tobins used
to move money into the Caribbean.

00:42.914 --> 00:45.086
Danielle Marchetti's daughter.

01:10.657 --> 01:12.025
Hello.

01:12.093 --> 01:14.558
I woke you up.

01:14.626 --> 01:16.559
W... what time is it?

01:16.627 --> 01:18.661
It's almost 4:00.

01:18.729 --> 01:19.592
I thought you'd be asleep.

01:19.660 --> 01:21.890
I was about to leave a message.

01:21.958 --> 01:22.892
You're okay?

01:22.960 --> 01:24.228
Is everything okay?

01:24.295 --> 01:27.568
I'm having a few friends
over for dinner on Thursday.

01:27.635 --> 01:30.405
Hoping you could join.

01:30.473 --> 01:31.307
Thursday night?

01:32.043 --> 01:32.643
Yeah.

01:32.711 --> 01:34.012
Yeah, sure.

01:34.079 --> 01:35.047
It's okay.

01:35.115 --> 01:36.883
Good.

01:36.951 --> 01:38.887
Go back to sleep.

01:44.130 --> 01:47.538
Everything okay?

01:47.606 --> 01:48.674
Yeah, everything's

01:48.741 --> 01:50.744
fine.

02:48.932 --> 02:49.865
Ms. Marchetti.

02:49.933 --> 02:51.433
Welcome.

02:51.501 --> 02:52.801
Nice to see you, Mary.

02:52.868 --> 02:56.435
I'll take you back for your deposit.

03:13.784 --> 03:14.916
Excuse me, sir.

03:14.984 --> 03:18.921
Is the girl a friend of yours?

03:18.989 --> 03:21.090
What girl?

03:21.157 --> 03:23.258
Ah, I must have been mistaken.

03:23.325 --> 03:26.093
Is there something I can help you with?

03:26.161 --> 03:29.797
No, I'm doing great.

03:29.865 --> 03:31.132
Ah, sorry for asking, sir,

03:31.199 --> 03:32.833
but do you have an account here

03:32.900 --> 03:34.900
at the Royal Antiguan Bank?

03:34.968 --> 03:36.368
No, I'm meeting someone here.

03:36.436 --> 03:38.903
We're going sightseeing.

03:38.971 --> 03:40.871
Well, sir, I'm afraid if you
don't have an account with

03:40.939 --> 03:43.839
us, I'm going to have to
ask you to wait outside.

03:43.907 --> 03:45.140
Oh.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.341
No problem.

03:47.909 --> 03:49.809
Maybe you can, uh, help me with this.

03:49.877 --> 03:51.144
If I head over to the Chesterton

03:51.211 --> 03:54.549
dockyard, where's the best
place to see the regatta?

03:54.617 --> 03:56.651
Well, uh, this is a bank, sir.

03:56.719 --> 04:00.321
Uh, perhaps you should check
with your hotel concierge.

04:00.388 --> 04:01.221
My apologies.

04:01.289 --> 04:03.924
I'll, uh, I'll wait outside.

04:11.332 --> 04:12.665
What's the matter?

04:12.733 --> 04:15.968
You don't seem yourself.

04:16.035 --> 04:18.603
Uh, my mother passed away.

04:18.670 --> 04:19.803
Oh, dear.

04:19.870 --> 04:21.838
I'm so sorry.

04:21.906 --> 04:25.007
Thank you.

04:25.075 --> 04:27.075
You know where to sign.

04:39.687 --> 04:41.489
Okay.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.860
You sure you don't want to count it?

04:45.927 --> 04:48.095
It's always all there.

04:48.163 --> 04:51.131
I'm so sorry about your mother.

04:54.067 --> 04:56.835
How many branches of the
Royal Antiguan Bank are there?

04:56.903 --> 04:57.936
Only the one.

04:58.004 --> 05:00.905
And Tessa Marchetti didn't
visit any other banks?

05:00.973 --> 05:01.705
That's right.

05:01.773 --> 05:04.108
She must have an account at R.A.B.

05:04.175 --> 05:06.077
They clearly know her over there.

05:06.145 --> 05:07.612
Now we have the name of a bank.

05:07.680 --> 05:08.579
It's a start.

05:08.647 --> 05:11.114
Do you want me to head back to New York?

05:11.182 --> 05:15.218
No, stay down there. See if
you can get Tessa to talk.

05:15.286 --> 05:17.186
Okay.

05:19.189 --> 05:20.455
Yes, my friend.

05:20.523 --> 05:22.524
I have your list right here.

05:25.661 --> 05:29.230
One of the names you requested
that I watch out for turned up.

05:29.297 --> 05:31.732
Which one is it?

05:31.799 --> 05:33.933
Thomas Shayes.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.902
Oh, son of a bitch.

05:36.970 --> 05:41.640
Customs confirmed that he entered
the country and has yet to leave us.

05:41.707 --> 05:44.409
He needs to be watched.

05:44.476 --> 05:45.443
Can you do that?

05:45.510 --> 05:48.545
Anything you ask I can
make possible, Mr. Zedeck.

05:48.613 --> 05:49.212
Good.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.646
Let me know what he's doing.

05:50.714 --> 05:51.814
No need to worry.

05:51.882 --> 05:54.482
You have yourself a
good day now, my friend.

05:54.550 --> 05:56.017
Yeah, yeah.

05:56.085 --> 06:00.254
You, too.

06:00.321 --> 06:03.323
Goddamn it!

06:03.390 --> 06:05.791
Here's the list of
possessions your office seized

06:05.859 --> 06:08.193
from the Tobin family's home.

06:08.261 --> 06:11.595
I filed an injunction with
judge Reilly to prevent you

06:11.663 --> 06:15.700
from auctioning off
any item marked in red.

06:15.767 --> 06:18.170
Marilyn Tobin actually
believes she has a right to

06:18.237 --> 06:21.238
keep her chippendale desk?

06:21.306 --> 06:22.639
Absolutely.

06:22.707 --> 06:25.174
The desk, the clocks, the mink coat.

06:25.242 --> 06:30.178
Every item on that list
belonged to Marilyn's mother.

06:30.246 --> 06:34.816
I didn't take you for a hunter.

06:34.884 --> 06:36.251
Excuse me?

06:36.319 --> 06:39.553
Or maybe you fancy
yourself more as a warrior.

06:41.922 --> 06:46.860
African art is one of
Marilyn's many passions.

06:46.927 --> 06:50.229
Having confiscated most of
it, I suspect you knew that.

06:50.297 --> 06:52.498
You let Mrs. Tobin do your decorating?

06:52.565 --> 06:55.267
She enjoys it.

06:55.335 --> 06:58.569
Well...

06:58.637 --> 07:02.939
Judge Reilly is not gonna stop
me from selling any of these.

07:03.007 --> 07:06.742
But while I'm here...

07:06.809 --> 07:08.810
I want to offer you a deal.

07:08.911 --> 07:11.813
My clients aren't guilty of anything.

07:11.880 --> 07:13.347
They're not interested in a deal.

07:13.415 --> 07:14.982
I'm not talking about your clients.

07:15.050 --> 07:18.118
I'm talking about you.

07:18.186 --> 07:22.021
There's still time for you
to walk away from this case,

07:22.089 --> 07:25.191
before it destroys what's
left of your reputation.

07:25.258 --> 07:27.059
That's very gracious of you.

07:27.126 --> 07:29.060
But I'm not worried.

07:29.128 --> 07:36.233
So after 27 years, you're
entirely loyal to the Tobins.

07:40.070 --> 07:43.105
You probably think you're
like family to them.

07:45.775 --> 07:48.176
Other than my loyalties, Patty, is there

07:48.244 --> 07:50.078
anything else you'd like to discuss?

07:50.145 --> 07:54.648
You're not a Tobin, Mr. Winstone.

07:54.716 --> 07:58.051
Keep acting like a Tobin...

07:58.119 --> 08:00.120
and I'll punish you like one.

08:10.061 --> 08:12.062
It's open.

08:18.134 --> 08:20.335
Hello?

08:20.403 --> 08:23.271
Ellen?

08:24.005 --> 08:25.973
Come in.

08:26.041 --> 08:28.476
I'm sorry, am I early?

08:28.544 --> 08:31.212
Early for what?

08:31.280 --> 08:33.347
For, uh, the dinner party.

08:33.414 --> 08:36.049
You called and invited me.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.418
No, that's for tomorrow.

08:38.485 --> 08:39.684
Tomorrow night.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.187
Friday.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.622
But you said Thursday.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.289
Did I?

08:45.357 --> 08:47.691
I... I don't think so.

08:47.759 --> 08:49.960
Hi, Ellen.

08:50.028 --> 08:50.694
Oh.

08:50.761 --> 08:51.828
Hi.

08:51.896 --> 08:54.163
You remember Alex.

08:54.231 --> 08:56.698
Yeah, of course.

08:56.766 --> 08:57.799
Nice to see you.

08:57.867 --> 09:02.203
I'm told that you were very
helpful with her interview process.

09:02.270 --> 09:03.638
I'm glad to hear that.

09:03.706 --> 09:07.541
I'm, uh, just bringing Alex
up to speed on the Tobin case.

09:07.609 --> 09:09.376
I'd invite you to join...

09:09.444 --> 09:10.143
No, no.

09:10.211 --> 09:12.645
You're talking shop.

09:12.713 --> 09:15.181
Sorry about the mix-up.

09:15.249 --> 09:16.415
My mistake.

09:16.483 --> 09:19.551
So same time tomorrow night then?

09:19.618 --> 09:21.619
We'll see.

09:26.458 --> 09:28.959
Is this the bottle you asked for?

09:29.026 --> 09:31.761
That's perfect.

09:31.829 --> 09:34.030
I like Ellen.

09:34.097 --> 09:36.499
You must miss having her around.

09:40.504 --> 09:42.838
Let's have some wine.

09:50.038 --> 09:53.373
Thanks for coming in, Ms. Parsons.

09:53.441 --> 09:58.244
I was hoping you could help me with...
you know, clear up a few details.

10:06.719 --> 10:08.685
Do you... do you recognize this

10:08.753 --> 10:11.052
handbag?

10:13.754 --> 10:18.223
Yeah, I, uh, I had one just like it.

10:18.291 --> 10:23.429
'Cause we, uh, we found this... inside it.

10:30.170 --> 10:32.939
So, I mean, I have to think this is yours.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.374
Right?

10:34.442 --> 10:36.376
I guess so.

10:36.444 --> 10:40.614
I want you to tell me how this... bag

10:40.681 --> 10:42.482
ended up bloody in... in... in a

10:42.550 --> 10:45.952
homeless man's shopping cart.

10:46.019 --> 10:48.688
I... I couldn't say.

10:48.755 --> 10:50.456
Huntley why not?

10:50.523 --> 10:53.860
Because it was stolen.

10:58.832 --> 11:01.501
You were talking in your sleep last night.

11:01.569 --> 11:03.637
Really? What was I saying?

11:03.704 --> 11:06.506
Well, I couldn't really
understand. You were mumbling.

11:06.573 --> 11:09.074
But, uh, do you remember the dream?

11:09.142 --> 11:12.077
No, I don't think I had one.

11:12.145 --> 11:16.881
So did you find anything
out on Alex Benjamin?

11:16.949 --> 11:20.501
Ah, just the basics. You
know, she was born in the UK,

11:20.502 --> 11:24.054
came to the States to go to
Princeton, graduated Yale law.

11:24.121 --> 11:24.821
Hmm.

11:24.889 --> 11:26.389
So she's a idiot.

11:28.859 --> 11:30.526
Uh, yeah.

11:30.594 --> 11:31.861
But, uh...

11:31.928 --> 11:34.164
Why do you want to know about this girl?

11:34.232 --> 11:36.735
I'm just curious.

11:36.803 --> 11:38.471
I like Alex.

11:38.539 --> 11:41.257
You're not jealous that
she's working for Patty?

11:41.258 --> 11:43.976
No, not at all. She deserves it.

11:44.044 --> 11:45.544
She's very talented.

11:45.612 --> 11:49.681
In fact, I was wondering if you
could write an article on her.

11:49.748 --> 11:52.249
What kind of article?

11:52.317 --> 11:57.686
Like a personal interest piece on
a rising star in the legal world.

12:08.637 --> 12:10.237
Yeah?

12:10.304 --> 12:12.572
Joe, it's me.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.374
Hey.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.743
Sorry.

12:16.811 --> 12:20.364
I thought we were meeting in an hour.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.917
No. You know, I'm sorry, I have to cancel.

12:23.985 --> 12:25.551
Everything okay?

12:25.619 --> 12:27.518
I'm going out of town.

12:27.585 --> 12:29.953
An old friend's sick.

12:30.020 --> 12:31.253
Who's that?

12:31.320 --> 12:36.254
Just... someone from law school.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.654
How long will you be gone?

12:38.722 --> 12:40.254
Just a day.

12:40.322 --> 12:42.926
Okay.

12:42.994 --> 12:44.326
I'm sorry.

12:44.394 --> 12:46.058
I hope everything works out.

12:46.126 --> 12:48.495
Yeah. Me, too.

12:48.562 --> 12:53.800
So I'm on my cell phone
if you need anything, okay?

12:53.868 --> 12:56.565
- You all right?
- Yeah. All right.

12:56.633 --> 12:58.632
Okay.

13:16.215 --> 13:19.016
Tessa Marchetti?

13:19.084 --> 13:20.316
Yes.

13:20.384 --> 13:24.085
Hi, I'm Tom Shayes. I'm an
attorney handling the Tobin case.

13:24.153 --> 13:26.752
I'm working with the
trustee's office in New York.

13:26.820 --> 13:29.736
I'm sorry, I don't know
anything about that.

13:29.737 --> 13:32.653
Well, good, then I won't
take up too much of your time.

13:32.720 --> 13:36.951
I, um, I understand that your
mother passed away recently.

13:37.018 --> 13:38.216
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:38.284 --> 13:40.383
Thank you.

13:40.450 --> 13:43.552
I'm afraid it's my job to
ask you a few questions.

13:43.620 --> 13:46.221
Do you mind if I sit?

13:46.288 --> 13:49.289
Yes.

13:49.357 --> 13:53.692
I saw you go into a bank and I, um...

13:53.760 --> 13:56.228
Just curious what kind of
business you have there.

13:56.296 --> 13:58.063
Why?

13:58.131 --> 14:03.566
Look, Tessa, I could subpoena you,
but I don't want to have to do that.

14:03.634 --> 14:10.942
I think it would be easier on both
of us if you just talk to me now.

14:11.010 --> 14:12.578
Okay.

14:12.646 --> 14:15.381
I get my paycheck from the airlines.

14:15.449 --> 14:19.317
I walk in, I sit down, I sign some
documents, they give me my money.

14:19.385 --> 14:21.352
Very fascinating stuff.

14:21.420 --> 14:22.553
Documents?

14:22.620 --> 14:24.187
What kind of documents?

14:24.255 --> 14:24.921
I get my money in.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.825
U.S. dollars, so I have to sign documents.

14:27.892 --> 14:29.926
It's protocol.

14:29.993 --> 14:32.360
How many documents do you sign?

14:32.428 --> 14:34.662
What difference does that make?

14:34.730 --> 14:35.729
Might be important.

14:35.797 --> 14:37.797
Just try and think.

14:37.865 --> 14:40.332
I don't know...

14:40.400 --> 14:43.368
Three. I think three.

14:43.436 --> 14:45.703
Tessa, one last thing.

14:45.771 --> 14:48.004
Are you a citizen of Antigua?

14:48.072 --> 14:52.808
I was born here, but I
have dual citizenship.

14:54.577 --> 14:56.010
Am I in trouble?

14:56.078 --> 15:00.446
Not if you keep telling the truth.

15:00.514 --> 15:02.648
Thank you.

15:02.716 --> 15:03.849
Why me?

15:03.917 --> 15:06.718
Well, I've been following the Tobin case.

15:06.786 --> 15:09.988
And I heard that you were
just hired by Patty Hewes.

15:10.055 --> 15:11.322
That's right.

15:11.390 --> 15:13.224
Congratulations by the way.

15:13.292 --> 15:14.024
Thank you.

15:14.092 --> 15:18.495
So I was hoping to write a feature
on a young lawyer on the rise.

15:18.563 --> 15:20.630
As long as you don't ask me anything about

15:20.698 --> 15:22.098
Patty or the Tobin case.

15:22.166 --> 15:23.199
Oh, absolutely.

15:23.266 --> 15:24.300
Okay, then.

15:24.367 --> 15:28.003
Do you mind if I record this?

15:35.544 --> 15:39.579
Hey, give us a minute, would you?

15:43.648 --> 15:45.215
Want a drink, Joe?

15:45.282 --> 15:48.448
Not right now. Thanks.

15:54.618 --> 15:57.550
Did you give your mother that sable yet?

15:57.618 --> 16:00.414
I will do that.

16:00.482 --> 16:05.784
And, uh... thank you for the money.

16:05.851 --> 16:09.220
Ah, so you trust me now.

16:09.287 --> 16:12.789
You said there was a problem.

16:15.024 --> 16:17.158
You know about Antigua?

16:17.226 --> 16:18.459
The bank, yeah.

16:18.527 --> 16:20.894
It was in the information my father left.

16:20.961 --> 16:24.029
Well, I have a contact
down there and he said

16:24.097 --> 16:29.335
that Patty Hewes sent her partner
on a little trip to the Caribbean.

16:29.403 --> 16:32.473
How does Patty Hewes know about Antigua?

16:35.543 --> 16:37.646
I have to tell you something, Joe.

16:37.714 --> 16:39.148
Ben.

16:39.216 --> 16:41.218
Sure thing.

16:44.393 --> 16:48.599
Your father used a courier
to help move the money.

16:48.667 --> 16:52.301
Yeah?

16:52.369 --> 16:54.237
Who did he use?

16:54.304 --> 16:56.877
Someone he could trust.

16:56.944 --> 16:59.278
Family.

17:03.615 --> 17:06.715
I'm... I don't understand you.

17:08.685 --> 17:13.622
Your father had a daughter,
Joe, with Danielle Marchetti.

17:19.395 --> 17:21.396
What?

17:21.464 --> 17:25.970
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you, but it's true.

17:31.713 --> 17:38.326
I guess Patty Hewes,
uh... found out about her.

17:39.795 --> 17:41.462
How?

17:41.530 --> 17:43.698
How did she find out?

17:43.765 --> 17:47.434
Someone must have told her.

17:47.502 --> 17:50.103
Do you have any idea who?

17:57.075 --> 18:00.343
I don't think Tessa Marchetti is
aware of what she's actually doing.

18:00.411 --> 18:03.179
What documents is she signing?

18:03.247 --> 18:06.582
She says they're for cashing
her paychecks into U.S. dollars.

18:06.649 --> 18:07.816
Is she right?

18:07.884 --> 18:10.985
Well, only two forms are
required for that transaction.

18:11.053 --> 18:14.288
She says she... she signs three each week.

18:14.355 --> 18:17.924
They're using the third
form to move money.

18:17.992 --> 18:20.760
I think she may be signing
something she doesn't understand.

18:20.827 --> 18:22.628
I'll bring this
information to Judge Reilly.

18:22.696 --> 18:26.765
See if he can pressure the Antiguan
government to give us access to her account.

18:26.832 --> 18:29.600
Tom, we're making progress.

18:36.173 --> 18:38.174
Thank you.

18:39.944 --> 18:41.210
So what's up?

18:41.278 --> 18:44.680
Well, I wanted to warn you actually.

18:44.747 --> 18:46.014
Warn me?

18:46.082 --> 18:47.048
About what?

18:47.116 --> 18:50.650
A writer from The Observer
sent me an article on you.

18:50.718 --> 18:52.218
He wanted a quote from me about

18:52.285 --> 18:54.620
working for Patty in my first year.

18:54.687 --> 18:55.620
Did you read it?

18:55.688 --> 18:56.555
Yeah, it's great.

18:56.622 --> 18:57.422
Very flattering.

18:57.490 --> 19:00.825
I love what you say about law
school versus the real world.

19:00.893 --> 19:03.593
So what's the problem?

19:03.661 --> 19:04.861
Patty.

19:04.929 --> 19:06.728
She'll hate it.

19:06.796 --> 19:10.497
She doesn't want her
attorneys promoting themselves.

19:10.565 --> 19:12.832
Says it shines a negative
light on the firm.

19:12.900 --> 19:15.000
Got it.

19:15.068 --> 19:16.668
I should stop the piece.

19:16.736 --> 19:19.002
Well, I hope you don't
mind, but I already tried.

19:19.070 --> 19:23.439
I asked the journalist, but he
said he's going to run it anyway.

19:23.506 --> 19:24.940
What should I do?

19:25.007 --> 19:28.442
Get in front of the situation.

19:28.509 --> 19:33.779
Take it to Patty, and tell
her you made a mistake.

19:33.847 --> 19:35.747
It'll be fine.

19:35.814 --> 19:38.115
Trust me.

19:53.671 --> 19:55.672
Pretty terrific, huh?

19:57.308 --> 19:59.309
What?

19:59.377 --> 20:01.778
The birds.

20:06.749 --> 20:09.751
Can I help you, sir?

20:09.819 --> 20:10.785
Yes.

20:10.853 --> 20:12.653
Um...

20:12.721 --> 20:16.756
I'm, uh, here to see Barbara Wiggins.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.825
One moment please.

20:21.127 --> 20:23.461
Wouldn't want to miss her birthday.

20:23.528 --> 20:24.696
Oh, um...

20:24.764 --> 20:26.365
You know, actually, uh...

20:26.433 --> 20:28.100
What's your name, sir?

20:28.167 --> 20:29.734
Leonard Winstone.

20:29.802 --> 20:33.204
Mr. Winstone, would you
mind stepping to the door.

20:34.706 --> 20:36.707
Okay.

20:39.176 --> 20:42.811
I find it's always best to
discuss these things privately.

20:42.879 --> 20:44.779
What things?

20:44.847 --> 20:47.748
I'm sorry, I don't know
what we're talking about.

20:47.816 --> 20:51.552
Well, um, the fact is that...

20:51.619 --> 20:58.124
I'm sorry to be the one to inform
you, but Barbara Wiggins passed away.

21:05.664 --> 21:07.665
When?

21:10.035 --> 21:13.470
Almost five months ago.

21:13.538 --> 21:15.438
I don't understand.

21:15.506 --> 21:19.208
Why wasn't I notified if
it was five months ago?

21:19.276 --> 21:27.314
Well, it says here that her
husband, Mr. Albert Wiggins,

21:27.382 --> 21:33.419
asked to make the arrangements,
and he took care of everything.

21:33.486 --> 21:34.752
Mr. Wiggins did?

21:34.820 --> 21:36.554
Yes, um...

21:36.622 --> 21:42.394
Mr. Wiggins saw to all the particulars.

21:44.464 --> 21:47.199
I see.

21:57.708 --> 21:59.708
Well...

22:03.012 --> 22:07.347
I'm sure dying in your care was

22:07.414 --> 22:09.415
a blessing.

22:16.420 --> 22:17.019
Hey.

22:17.087 --> 22:22.190
Hey. All right, um, so we
have both Louis Tobin and

22:20.756 --> 22:23.023
Danielle Marchetti dying
of potassium overdoses.

22:23.091 --> 22:27.393
But we still can't find any
definitive link between the deaths.

22:27.460 --> 22:31.166
Who's the last family member
to see Louis the night he died?

22:31.234 --> 22:31.969
Joe.

22:32.036 --> 22:35.338
What do you think, Joe helped
his father commit suicide?

22:35.405 --> 22:37.539
If he did, he might also
have something to do with.

22:37.607 --> 22:38.706
Danielle's death.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.709
All right, so let's bring him
down here and question him.

22:41.776 --> 22:45.546
No, I don't want to give him
time to prepare a response.

22:45.614 --> 22:49.682
Be better to catch him off
guard and see how he reacts.

22:51.051 --> 22:52.951
Sure you don't want one, honey?

22:53.019 --> 22:56.421
No, mom, and you shouldn't either.

23:01.161 --> 23:04.496
You're losing weight, Carol.

23:04.564 --> 23:06.031
Screw depression.

23:06.099 --> 23:08.868
At lunch, I want to see you eat something.

23:08.936 --> 23:10.903
I'm going down to get some cigarettes.

23:10.971 --> 23:11.870
Do you need anything?

23:11.938 --> 23:12.905
No, thanks.

23:12.973 --> 23:16.609
Now is not a good time for
you to fall apart on me.

23:16.677 --> 23:20.379
I'll meet you at the lobby.

23:25.820 --> 23:29.324
What?

23:29.391 --> 23:32.026
Did you talk to Patty Hewes?

23:32.093 --> 23:33.760
I'm worried about Carol.

23:33.828 --> 23:38.333
You need to take it easier on her, mom.

23:40.936 --> 23:43.104
I asked you a question.

23:43.172 --> 23:45.339
Yes, I talked to Ms. Hewes.

23:45.407 --> 23:46.574
So what?

23:46.642 --> 23:51.345
Did you tell her about the
daughter that dad had with Danielle?

23:51.412 --> 23:55.949
There's no point in
protecting your father anymore.

23:56.016 --> 23:58.017
Yes, there is.

24:06.360 --> 24:08.494
Open it.

24:25.612 --> 24:27.980
What is this?

24:28.048 --> 24:31.183
The tip of the iceberg.

24:31.251 --> 24:33.285
What do you mean?

24:33.353 --> 24:38.591
Dad had a plan to take care of us.

24:38.658 --> 24:41.526
Before he died, he hid some money.

24:41.594 --> 24:42.894
How much?

24:42.962 --> 24:45.763
A lot of money, mom.

24:45.831 --> 24:50.134
We're going to be okay, understand?

24:52.703 --> 24:55.838
But I promise you, as
soon as this case is done,

24:55.906 --> 24:59.642
I'm gonna take everyone
on a real vacation, okay.

24:59.710 --> 25:03.113
But, honey, I gotta go, all right?

25:03.180 --> 25:06.382
All right, I love you, and
I'll speak to you later.

25:06.450 --> 25:09.151
Bye-bye.

25:12.354 --> 25:15.921
I want to talk to you
about miss Tessa Marchetti.

25:15.989 --> 25:22.090
At the bank, I could see
you have an interest in her.

25:22.158 --> 25:24.090
Yes, I do.

25:24.158 --> 25:27.758
You will never get the information
you need from the institution.

25:27.826 --> 25:31.457
I know about your country's privacy laws.

25:31.525 --> 25:34.524
I can help you circumvent that problem.

25:34.592 --> 25:38.390
I can get access to her account.

25:38.457 --> 25:41.554
In exchange for what?

25:48.425 --> 25:51.227
This is my daughter.

25:51.294 --> 25:52.995
Hmm.

25:53.062 --> 25:57.460
She's an angel, but she's very sick.

25:57.527 --> 26:00.328
I'm sorry to hear that.

26:00.396 --> 26:06.433
My wife and I lack resources
to seek treats abroad.

26:06.501 --> 26:13.806
In exchange for visas to the
U.S., I can get you what you need.

26:17.310 --> 26:20.545
I see.

26:20.613 --> 26:23.514
I realize it is an unusual request.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.616
I hope I have not offended you in anyway.

26:26.684 --> 26:28.118
No, no, no.

26:28.186 --> 26:31.154
I'll see what I can do.

26:31.221 --> 26:34.023
I would be most grateful.

26:34.124 --> 26:38.426
But sir, please, don't
come back to the bank.

26:38.494 --> 26:42.696
If you need to reach me, call this number.

26:52.438 --> 26:55.439
Joe Tobin?

26:56.908 --> 27:02.178
I'm Ellen Parsons. I work
for the district attorney.

27:02.245 --> 27:03.979
How'd you find me?

27:04.046 --> 27:06.747
Know your hotel's across the street.

27:06.815 --> 27:08.948
Well, talk to my lawyer, ok?

27:09.016 --> 27:11.350
It's personal.

27:11.417 --> 27:15.886
I thought you should know the
actual cause of your father's death.

27:15.954 --> 27:18.654
It was a heart attack.

27:18.722 --> 27:21.356
I read the coroner's report.

27:21.424 --> 27:24.892
Well, we have reason to
believe it was a suicide,

27:24.959 --> 27:26.860
most likely caused by elevated

27:26.927 --> 27:32.564
levels of potassium, the same
chemical used in lethal injections.

27:32.632 --> 27:34.833
Listen, uh, miss..

27:34.901 --> 27:36.335
Parsons.

27:36.403 --> 27:39.971
Miss Parsons, um, I was the
one who found his body, okay?

27:40.039 --> 27:42.905
There were no...

27:42.973 --> 27:45.073
uh... chemicals.

27:45.140 --> 27:49.342
He was an old man with a bad
heart under too much stress.

27:49.410 --> 27:51.577
I'm sorry.

27:51.645 --> 27:53.645
You're probably right.

27:53.713 --> 27:56.915
That makes sense.

27:56.982 --> 28:02.718
- But that doesn't explain Danielle Marchetti.
- What about her?

28:02.786 --> 28:07.855
She also died of a heart attack
from a potassium overdose.

28:12.059 --> 28:15.360
I don't know anything about it.

28:15.427 --> 28:18.162
So...

28:25.801 --> 28:30.336
Well, then...

28:30.404 --> 28:32.604
I'll let you enjoy your dinner.

28:36.708 --> 28:38.342
We're all set.

28:38.409 --> 28:40.777
I was able to secure three
visas for your contact.

28:40.844 --> 28:43.112
Great. You make any
progress with the judge?

28:43.180 --> 28:47.816
No, his people are having a tough time trying
to find an official in Antigua we can trust.

28:47.884 --> 28:50.452
- I don't doubt it.
- There is a man in the

28:50.520 --> 28:52.320
finance ministry who's been
cooperative in the past.

28:52.388 --> 28:54.421
So we're trying to reach out to him.

28:54.489 --> 28:57.457
If I can meet with him while
I'm down here, I should do that.

28:57.524 --> 29:01.526
I'll let you know if we
can arrange something.

29:03.395 --> 29:06.062
Heading home?

29:06.130 --> 29:09.698
Or do you have time for one more customer?

29:09.766 --> 29:11.368
Sir, I'm sorry.

29:11.436 --> 29:13.704
The bank is closed.

29:13.772 --> 29:15.772
You know who I am?

29:15.840 --> 29:19.543
Yes, I think so.

29:19.611 --> 29:20.946
Good.

29:21.013 --> 29:24.584
I have one quick question
about a recent transaction.

29:24.652 --> 29:26.720
What kind of transaction?

29:26.788 --> 29:31.429
Between yourself and an American.

29:53.830 --> 29:55.365
Look who's here.

29:55.434 --> 29:59.105
If it ain't prince shit.

29:59.173 --> 30:01.340
Welcome home.

30:01.408 --> 30:03.976
Why didn't you tell me she died?

30:04.044 --> 30:05.444
Oh, you know about that?

30:05.511 --> 30:07.045
I went to visit her.

30:07.113 --> 30:12.216
You think I wasn't gonna find out?

30:12.284 --> 30:14.585
Why didn't you tell me?

30:14.652 --> 30:16.586
Why the hell would I do that?

30:16.654 --> 30:19.289
You never gave a shit
about your mother anyway.

30:19.356 --> 30:22.725
Grab that trash, will ya?

30:22.792 --> 30:26.895
You've been cashing those
checks I sent for her.

30:26.963 --> 30:29.263
That money was for mom, not you!

30:29.331 --> 30:31.065
You calling me a thief?

30:31.133 --> 30:32.766
That's exactly what I'm calling you!

30:32.834 --> 30:37.104
You open your trap again, you little
prick, and we're gonna have problems.

30:37.172 --> 30:38.572
Go for it, dad.

30:38.639 --> 30:43.075
I am right here.

30:43.143 --> 30:46.578
I seen you on TV,

30:46.646 --> 30:50.181
defending that family.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.817
Hiding their crimes, huh?

30:55.287 --> 30:59.322
It's almost funny. You're a
bigger fraud than they are.

30:59.389 --> 31:02.758
You're gonna get that money back to me.

31:02.826 --> 31:04.626
No, actually, I'm not.

31:04.694 --> 31:06.961
You're gonna keep those checks coming.

31:07.029 --> 31:10.798
In fact, let's double 'em up.

31:10.866 --> 31:14.034
Why would I possibly do that?

31:14.102 --> 31:19.138
Because I got a big mouth, Mr. Winstone.

31:19.206 --> 31:21.506
What's that family gonna do when

31:21.574 --> 31:27.811
they find out you've been
lying to them all these years?

31:27.879 --> 31:29.879
You ever wonder that?

31:55.735 --> 31:56.668
What?

31:56.736 --> 31:59.604
Forensics came back on
the girl's stolen bag.

31:59.672 --> 32:00.371
And?

32:00.439 --> 32:03.841
We've got an I.D. on
a partial fingerprint.

32:03.909 --> 32:05.576
Whose is it?

32:05.643 --> 32:07.878
There's only one match in the system.

32:07.945 --> 32:11.014
Dates back to 1984.

32:11.081 --> 32:17.486
Guy was a small-time grifter, a petty
thief by the name of Lester Wiggins.

32:20.422 --> 32:23.958
And the blood, was it Wiggins' as well?

32:24.025 --> 32:25.659
No way to tell.

32:25.727 --> 32:27.527
DNA database doesn't go back that far.

32:27.595 --> 32:31.664
Okay, well, I guess you better
find this... this Lester Winnows.

32:31.732 --> 32:34.133
"Wiggins."

32:34.201 --> 32:36.301
Just find him.

32:36.368 --> 32:39.570
Righty-o.

32:39.638 --> 32:41.605
Toodle-oo.

32:49.607 --> 32:51.408
Very complimentary.

32:51.476 --> 32:53.810
It was wrong for me
to grant the interview.

32:53.877 --> 32:55.211
I should have asked you first.

32:55.279 --> 32:57.580
Yes. You should have.

32:57.647 --> 32:59.649
Sorry.

32:59.716 --> 33:03.486
So what... have we learned here?

33:03.554 --> 33:05.688
That I've got a big mouth.

33:05.756 --> 33:10.425
And if someone flatters you, you
have a hard time keeping it shut.

33:14.730 --> 33:17.464
The journalist's name is Josh Reston?

33:17.532 --> 33:19.632
Yes.

33:19.700 --> 33:21.467
Do you know him?

33:21.534 --> 33:25.403
No. Never met him before.

33:25.471 --> 33:28.773
How do you think he found you?

33:28.840 --> 33:32.643
Uh, he heard you hired me and called.

33:32.710 --> 33:36.047
Just like that, out of the blue?

33:36.115 --> 33:39.250
Yeah, I g... guess so.

33:39.318 --> 33:42.618
Am I missing something?

33:42.686 --> 33:46.756
Do yourself a favor.

33:46.824 --> 33:49.160
Don't talk to strangers.

34:05.307 --> 34:07.342
- Mr. Simmons.
- Yeah?

34:07.409 --> 34:10.045
Hi. I'm, uh, Ellen Parsons
from the DA's office.

34:10.780 --> 34:13.514
I know the, uh, police have
already spoken with you.

34:13.581 --> 34:15.280
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.

34:15.348 --> 34:16.281
No problem.

34:16.349 --> 34:18.014
I was real sorry about Ms. Marchetti.

34:18.081 --> 34:19.945
I mean, God, it was a shock, you know?

34:20.013 --> 34:22.245
Yeah. You were working the day she died.

34:22.312 --> 34:24.980
I was hoping you might
remember if anyone visited her.

34:25.047 --> 34:28.047
Well... I'm a doorman, I
remember faces. That's my job.

34:28.114 --> 34:34.313
So that man there, did he... enter
or leave the building that day?

34:34.382 --> 34:36.149
That's Joe Tobin, right?

34:37.016 --> 34:38.751
I recognized him from the papers.

34:38.819 --> 34:41.386
He came by, but it was
a couple days before.

34:41.454 --> 34:43.389
He wasn't there at all that day?

34:43.456 --> 34:44.157
No.

34:44.225 --> 34:47.592
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

34:47.659 --> 34:50.460
Who's this?

34:50.529 --> 34:53.531
That's Joe's sister, Carol.

34:53.599 --> 34:55.801
Why do you ask?

34:55.869 --> 34:59.705
Because she was there.

35:05.512 --> 35:07.746
Oh, you want the Tobins in jail?

35:07.814 --> 35:10.849
Uh, well, that's very decisive
of you, Jim, but we have a

35:10.917 --> 35:12.884
little problem... there's
no evidence the family knew

35:12.952 --> 35:14.619
anything about the fraud.

35:14.687 --> 35:17.455
Well, if you want to fire me,
fire me, but until then, cut the

35:17.522 --> 35:22.126
bullshit and quit questioning
my professional integrity.

35:22.193 --> 35:24.328
I didn't mean to interrupt.

35:24.396 --> 35:26.263
You know who that was?

35:26.331 --> 35:28.265
- District attorney?
- Yeah.

35:28.333 --> 35:30.084
I have the best conviction
record on his staff,

35:30.085 --> 35:31.835
but the man has the
memory of a second grader.

35:31.903 --> 35:36.273
So, if I don't put a Tobin in jail,
be out on my ass by this summer.

35:36.340 --> 35:42.179
I know we've spoken about this before, but I
really think Patty Hewes would be a useful ally.

35:42.247 --> 35:44.214
You've been here less than a year.

35:44.282 --> 35:46.216
You really want to dictate strategy?

35:46.284 --> 35:47.251
No. I'm sorry.

35:47.318 --> 35:49.286
Why don't you forget about Patty Hewes.

35:49.354 --> 35:50.321
You work for me now.

35:50.388 --> 35:52.356
And over here, we prosecute criminals.

35:52.424 --> 35:54.324
We don't bill by the hour.

35:54.391 --> 35:57.557
I just think Patty has a good chance
of getting the victims their money back.

35:58.624 --> 35:59.555
You really don't get it.

35:59.623 --> 36:01.552
I don't give a shit
about the victims' money.

36:01.620 --> 36:03.917
My job is to prove the Tobins are guilty.

36:03.985 --> 36:06.115
You understand?

36:06.183 --> 36:07.382
Perfectly.

36:07.449 --> 36:09.849
Okay, good.

36:12.085 --> 36:14.086
Now, what did you get from the doorman?

36:14.154 --> 36:19.525
Please tell me a Tobin had something
to do with Danielle Marchetti's death.

36:19.592 --> 36:24.795
I didn't get anything.

36:24.862 --> 36:28.065
I'm sorry.

36:40.808 --> 36:42.742
I've arranged the visas.

36:42.809 --> 36:47.045
If you get me your family's
information, I can have them tomorrow.

36:47.146 --> 36:48.079
Thank you.

36:48.147 --> 36:51.581
- I won't be needing them.
- Why not?

36:51.649 --> 36:57.152
I'm afraid I cannot help you with
the information you requested.

36:57.219 --> 36:59.553
You've been threatened.

36:59.621 --> 37:02.588
- Threatened?
- No.

37:02.656 --> 37:04.456
I've reconsidered.

37:04.524 --> 37:07.458
What about your sick daughter?

37:07.526 --> 37:09.026
She's feeling much better.

37:09.094 --> 37:11.595
- No, she's not.
- I'm sorry.

37:11.663 --> 37:15.031
I cannot help you.

37:15.098 --> 37:17.032
Take my advice, sir.

37:17.100 --> 37:19.334
Stop asking questions.

37:19.402 --> 37:23.170
Leave this island.

37:29.309 --> 37:34.111
Yes, I knew that your father
had a daughter with Danielle.

37:34.179 --> 37:36.146
He didn't want the family to
know, so I respected his wishes.

37:36.214 --> 37:38.148
You can't keep these
things from me, Lenny.

37:38.216 --> 37:40.150
It was something that your father...

37:40.217 --> 37:42.852
or I will cut you out of the whole thing.

37:42.919 --> 37:44.353
The money.

37:44.420 --> 37:46.321
The... the family.

37:46.388 --> 37:47.755
All of it.

37:47.823 --> 37:50.191
You understand?

37:50.259 --> 37:53.127
I understand.

37:59.133 --> 38:02.635
Something else.

38:02.703 --> 38:08.540
I was approached by some
woman in the DA's office.

38:08.607 --> 38:11.310
They're looking into Danielle's death.

38:11.377 --> 38:14.545
Let Zedeck know I want to meet.

38:14.613 --> 38:16.077
I'll call him.

38:16.145 --> 38:19.983
Okay, good.

38:20.050 --> 38:22.719
How's your friend? Okay?

38:22.787 --> 38:24.521
Yeah, doing much better.

38:24.589 --> 38:26.690
Thanks for asking.

38:28.563 --> 38:31.466
Okay.

38:36.674 --> 38:39.810
Sorry about the confusion the other night.

38:39.877 --> 38:43.980
No problem.

38:44.047 --> 38:47.749
So, Josh reston is back in town?

38:49.118 --> 38:50.751
I didn't know.

38:54.054 --> 38:59.190
You had him interview Alex for
a piece you knew I wouldn't like.

38:59.258 --> 39:02.225
And then you sent Alex to apologize.

39:02.293 --> 39:04.059
Why would I do that?

39:04.127 --> 39:06.461
To show me that you could get to her.

39:06.529 --> 39:08.529
You're upset that I replaced you.

39:08.597 --> 39:10.697
I think Alex is great.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.898
She's very excited about
working at the firm.

39:12.966 --> 39:16.134
So, you're not upset that I replaced you?

39:16.201 --> 39:18.269
Patty...

39:18.337 --> 39:19.837
You hired someone.

39:19.905 --> 39:21.905
You didn't replace me.

39:24.742 --> 39:30.876
Anyway, Alex Benjamin isn't why I'm here.

39:30.944 --> 39:33.278
I have some information.

39:33.346 --> 39:35.480
What kind of information?

39:35.547 --> 39:40.750
I think Carol Tobin may have
killed Danielle Marchetti.

39:40.818 --> 39:42.284
Why do you say that?

39:42.352 --> 39:49.021
Danielle's doorman told me that
Carol visited her the day she died.

39:49.089 --> 39:51.456
What does your boss think?

39:51.524 --> 39:55.194
I haven't told him.

39:55.261 --> 39:57.498
So, why are you telling me?

39:57.566 --> 40:01.541
Because Gates is only
interested in making arrests.

40:01.609 --> 40:03.712
But if you can get to Carol, you

40:03.780 --> 40:08.690
can use her as leverage
to find the Tobins' money.

40:10.692 --> 40:13.394
Maybe.

40:13.461 --> 40:18.732
I think it's time we
worked together on this.

40:18.799 --> 40:21.700
I thought that you had moved on.

40:21.768 --> 40:25.803
The case is what matters, Patty.

40:25.871 --> 40:29.440
I want you to find that money.

40:37.914 --> 40:40.882
Your contact's name is Horatio Emanuel.

40:40.950 --> 40:43.318
Thank you, Your Honor.

40:43.385 --> 40:45.386
You'll see he worked in
the country's financial

40:45.454 --> 40:47.888
services regulatory
commission for over a decade.

40:47.956 --> 40:50.991
If anyone down there knows
how Louis Tobin set up his

40:50.992 --> 40:54.026
accounts and started moving
money, it's Mr. Emanuel.

40:54.094 --> 40:57.262
I appreciate the trouble
you went through to vet him.

40:57.330 --> 40:59.331
May I advise you here, Patty?

40:59.398 --> 41:03.734
See him in person.

41:00.599 --> 41:02.066
Word is a lot of people have a

41:02.134 --> 41:03.734
lot to protect down there.

41:03.802 --> 41:06.937
I think he'll speak
more freely face-to-face.

41:07.005 --> 41:11.341
Sir, we respect your country's need to
protect the identity of account holders.

41:11.408 --> 41:14.043
But as a friend of the
U.S. government, I'm sure

41:14.110 --> 41:16.712
you recognize the importance
we place on locating Louis.

41:16.779 --> 41:18.113
Tobin's funds.

41:18.181 --> 41:19.147
Of course.

41:19.215 --> 41:21.949
And it is an honor to
have you both visiting.

41:22.017 --> 41:25.118
How may I be of assistance?

41:25.186 --> 41:30.289
We need access to this bank account.

41:30.357 --> 41:34.293
I will do everything possible
to provide you what you need.

41:34.360 --> 41:39.163
In the meantime, enjoy
your stay on the island.

41:39.231 --> 41:42.633
Cheers.
