00:22.423 --> 00:24.156
<i>What did you see?</i>

00:26.460 --> 00:30.162
I remember... falling.

00:33.034 --> 00:35.679
I remember... darkness.

00:38.239 --> 00:42.486
<i>Noise.</i>

00:42.510 --> 00:47.991
<i>And I remember flashing
lights and glass.</i>

00:48.015 --> 00:50.049
So much glass.

01:03.030 --> 01:04.763
I remember.

01:12.973 --> 01:17.387
Welcome to case study 2884.

01:17.411 --> 01:22.181
It's 13:00, I'm glad
you could join us.

01:26.053 --> 01:28.131
Post-traumatic amnesia,

01:28.155 --> 01:30.400
or PTA as we like to call it,

01:30.424 --> 01:33.136
is a phenomenon in which the
patient emerges from a coma

01:33.160 --> 01:37.307
suffering from some
degree of memory loss.

01:37.331 --> 01:40.710
Some short term and
some longer term.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.646
Yes, Mr. Morrow?

01:42.670 --> 01:45.782
Is-is that the woman who woke
up from a six-year coma?

01:45.806 --> 01:47.951
Yes, it is.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.920
Sit!

01:49.944 --> 01:52.622
It's like starting all
over from the beginning.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.758
Memories can be affected.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.793
Some will come back over time.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.096
Some will never come back.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.664
But she's running?

02:00.688 --> 02:02.666
Already?

02:02.690 --> 02:05.502
There is another factor
besides plasticity

02:05.526 --> 02:08.238
that can have a significant
impact on recovery.

02:08.262 --> 02:11.441
Not many of us in here have it.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.065
And what would that be?

02:15.002 --> 02:16.435
Stubbornness.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.085
Who knew?

02:22.109 --> 02:25.110
It's one of the most amazing
discoveries that we've made.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.548
Ready to go?

02:51.572 --> 02:52.649
Look at that.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.851
It's a different
world out there now.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.653
We've been sheltering you.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.487
Word travels.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.655
It's just a matter of time

02:58.679 --> 03:01.691
before the media
pay you a visit.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.126
What's the headline?

03:03.150 --> 03:05.695
Woman wakes up from coma and
draws a complete blank?

03:07.221 --> 03:08.965
Most of your memories
will come back,

03:08.989 --> 03:11.334
but until they do, let's
keep the media at bay.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.370
They'll just try
and confuse you.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.671
How do I do that?

03:14.695 --> 03:16.072
Hire a bodyguard?

03:16.096 --> 03:18.030
Look, I think you have one now.

03:19.577 --> 03:20.577
Marissa, honey.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.313
Mom.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.404
I can't wait to get you home.

03:27.346 --> 03:29.586
Here's your personal belongings
from when you checked in.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.922
You kept all this for six years?

03:31.946 --> 03:33.346
Don't go through all
that right now,

03:33.370 --> 03:35.225
just let the memories come back.

03:35.249 --> 03:37.382
Don't force them.

03:39.687 --> 03:40.997
I'll take that, honey.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.721
Alright.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.279
Home, sweet home.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.225
Let's get you inside, hmm.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.715
Surprise!

04:56.497 --> 04:58.775
Stop, please.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.810
Just give her some space.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.901
I'm sorry, I can't.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.778
You ok?

05:47.858 --> 05:48.858
You want some cake?

05:48.882 --> 05:51.695
I've got your notes here.

05:51.719 --> 05:55.332
Left ear, or something.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.032
Do you want me to go?

05:56.056 --> 05:57.067
Just say the word.

05:57.091 --> 05:59.836
Oh, no. Uh...

05:59.860 --> 06:04.908
Drink? Are you allowed to?

06:04.932 --> 06:06.998
Bottoms up.

06:08.502 --> 06:09.634
Wow.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.972
You still like a Riesling.

06:16.377 --> 06:18.154
Oh.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.389
Better?

06:19.413 --> 06:21.558
Do I know you?

06:21.582 --> 06:24.527
I'm sorry, I just have
these flashes, you know,

06:24.551 --> 06:27.652
but faces are kinda tricky.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.735
I'm Ethan.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.903
Oh, hi Ethan.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.171
I'm Marissa.

06:35.195 --> 06:35.872
Nice to meet you.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.207
Again.

06:37.231 --> 06:41.378
I mean, you and I,
we go way back.

06:41.402 --> 06:43.513
Oh.

06:43.537 --> 06:47.784
So how do we know each other?

06:47.808 --> 06:51.788
Come on, let me introduce you
to the Marissa that I know.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.123
Ok.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.593
That is the Marissa I remember.

06:56.617 --> 07:00.385
Well, I'm kinda glad that
I don't remember that.

07:04.425 --> 07:07.270
Thank you.

07:07.294 --> 07:10.295
I can't remember the last
time I laughed so hard.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.434
Oh.

07:17.905 --> 07:21.451
You know, not only am I
an expert table dancer,

07:21.475 --> 07:24.387
I'm also a journalist.

07:24.411 --> 07:28.992
I'd really like to
tell your story.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.293
Oh.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.128
What do you say?

07:32.152 --> 07:35.420
Thanks, but um...
I'm not interested.

07:39.359 --> 07:41.805
I can get you the lead story.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.173
Guaranteed.

07:43.197 --> 07:45.275
I don't want the lead story.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.509
I just want to be left alone.

07:46.533 --> 07:47.277
Just relax.

07:47.301 --> 07:47.944
Hear me out.

07:47.968 --> 07:48.678
Just hear me out.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.680
Wait-What's going on?

07:50.704 --> 07:52.982
I'm just a friend of Marissa's.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.318
Funny, I don't remember
her being friends

07:55.342 --> 07:57.809
with a reporter from Channel 3.

08:00.848 --> 08:04.861
This is the very first
time we've met, isn't it?

08:04.885 --> 08:06.918
Marissa, I'm sorry.

08:12.459 --> 08:15.205
If you ever need the media
on your side, I'll...

08:15.229 --> 08:17.295
I'll be good to her.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.288
<i>Heather.</i>

10:19.052 --> 10:22.031
<i>She is going to be
so happy to see you.</i>

10:22.055 --> 10:23.733
<i>How has she been?</i>

10:23.757 --> 10:26.235
<i>She hasn't been quite herself.</i>

10:26.259 --> 10:27.704
<i>So many gaps.</i>

10:27.728 --> 10:30.740
<i>In all fairness, she was
in a six-year sleep.</i>

10:30.764 --> 10:32.709
<i>She's bound to be
a little groggy.</i>

10:32.733 --> 10:36.212
Groggy doesn't even
begin to describe it...

10:36.236 --> 10:37.869
Here she is.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.152
Heather?

10:43.176 --> 10:44.921
Marissa.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.978
You remember me?

10:49.616 --> 10:52.929
It's so good to see you.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.330
Oh, here.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.187
It's on, here.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.869
<i>Congressman Cal Ward
announced today</i>

10:59.893 --> 11:01.771
<i>that he is running for Senator.</i>

11:01.795 --> 11:03.906
Former college football
star turned Democrat

11:03.930 --> 11:06.609
is known for his fierce
commitment to the middle class,

11:06.633 --> 11:09.245
<i>creating a ten percent increase
in the employment rate</i>

11:09.269 --> 11:10.580
<i>while in office.</i>

11:10.604 --> 11:14.117
I just want to make
one thing clear.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.919
This is about family.

11:16.943 --> 11:19.288
I'm running for senate
for one reason,

11:19.312 --> 11:21.557
and one reason only.

11:21.581 --> 11:25.428
To finish what the good
people of this state started.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.430
<i>Congressman Ward begins
his state-wide tour</i>

11:27.454 --> 11:30.889
stopping at 13 different
locations over the next-

11:32.292 --> 11:35.938
Wow, it's so good to see you.

11:35.962 --> 11:39.375
And you look amazing.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.577
So you're...

11:41.601 --> 11:42.412
Married.

11:42.436 --> 11:43.735
Yeah.

11:45.672 --> 11:50.420
I wanted to wait for you so you
could be my maid of honour,

11:50.444 --> 11:54.123
but we didn't know.

11:54.147 --> 11:57.393
You remember Cal?

11:57.417 --> 11:58.327
Oh...

11:58.351 --> 12:00.897
We were at college together.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.965
Well, he's running for Senator.

12:02.989 --> 12:05.601
We're in the middle
of a campaign.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.603
I'm so sorry I missed it.

12:07.627 --> 12:11.441
The wedding, dad's funeral.

12:11.465 --> 12:13.776
I just missed so much.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.112
I'm sorry I missed your party.

12:16.136 --> 12:19.615
The campaign, you know.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.918
Don't worry about it.

12:21.942 --> 12:25.988
I'm not much for parties
these days, anyway.

12:26.012 --> 12:30.460
I'm so glad you remember me.

12:30.484 --> 12:34.363
I have missed you so much.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.364
Come on now, you girls.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.708
You've got so much
to catch up on.

12:36.732 --> 12:39.302
Get out of my
kitchen, right now.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.837
Boy, we do have a
lot to catch up on.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.272
Well, me mainly.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.942
No offense but laying
in a bed for six years

12:45.966 --> 12:47.610
is hardly riveting.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.514
Wait a minute, are
you really my BFF?

12:51.538 --> 12:55.017
Yeah, and I have the friendship
necklace to prove it.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.674
This is gonna be
harder than I thought.

13:06.853 --> 13:09.365
<i>She's not gonna make it.</i>

13:12.893 --> 13:15.126
<i>Who's in charge of
the anesthetic here?</i>

13:51.231 --> 13:52.597
Thank you.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.669
Cheers.

14:03.910 --> 14:07.623
So what exactly do
you remember, then?

14:07.647 --> 14:10.459
Bits and pieces.

14:10.483 --> 14:13.029
You know, it's like a puzzle.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.953
I've got these
images in my head,

14:14.955 --> 14:20.970
but I just don't know how
to fit them all together.

14:20.994 --> 14:23.606
Maybe you can help me.

14:23.630 --> 14:27.610
Can you tell me
about the accident?

14:27.634 --> 14:29.212
What is it?

14:29.236 --> 14:31.047
Is there something
you're not telling me?

14:31.071 --> 14:33.816
I don't know what to say.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.741
I think it would be
dangerous to push you.

14:38.612 --> 14:42.291
You get to make a fresh
start in life, Marissa.

14:42.315 --> 14:46.095
It's time to leave
the past alone.

14:46.119 --> 14:49.298
Ok?

14:49.322 --> 14:51.122
Here, come here.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.403
Have this.

16:08.034 --> 16:10.680
Ah, it is you.

16:10.704 --> 16:11.981
Are you following me?

16:12.005 --> 16:13.549
I was trying to get
my caffeine fix,

16:13.573 --> 16:15.584
which is now all over my pants.

16:15.608 --> 16:16.385
Thanks.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.586
So this is a coincidence?

16:17.610 --> 16:19.755
Yes.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.257
But now that I have you here,

16:21.281 --> 16:24.894
I want to apologize for crashing
your party the other day.

16:24.918 --> 16:26.929
You were fresh out
of the hospital,

16:26.953 --> 16:27.697
I took advantage of that.

16:27.721 --> 16:29.398
I lied to you.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.900
Yeah, you made me
feel like an idiot.

16:30.924 --> 16:32.902
I know, it was a dumb move.

16:32.926 --> 16:34.904
I'm a jerk, I'm sorry.

16:34.928 --> 16:38.541
Ugh.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.209
I just want to be left alone!

16:40.233 --> 16:40.910
Marissa!

16:40.934 --> 16:43.579
Woah!

16:43.603 --> 16:46.248
Don't you want to know
who almost killed you?

16:46.272 --> 16:48.517
What?

16:48.541 --> 16:50.052
You were in a hit and run.

16:50.076 --> 16:52.521
And the person that put you in
that coma is still out there.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.023
I can help you bring
them to justice.

16:54.047 --> 16:55.257
No.

16:55.281 --> 16:58.127
It was just me.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.855
It was raining and the
pavement was wet.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.268
That's not how it was.

17:06.291 --> 17:07.069
I have photos.

17:07.093 --> 17:07.936
I'm a reporter.

17:07.961 --> 17:09.472
It's my business to know things.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.194
Actually, it's none
of your business.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.785
If I have a boy, I'm going
to name him Lachlan.

17:22.809 --> 17:25.253
If it's a girl, I'll name her
Abigail, after my grandmother.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.388
I would go with
Kennedy or Jolie.

17:31.785 --> 17:33.185
<i>She's not gonna make it.</i>

17:33.209 --> 17:35.064
<i>Who's in charge of
the anesthetic here?</i>

17:40.460 --> 17:41.504
Marissa!

17:41.528 --> 17:42.505
What's the matter?

17:42.529 --> 17:46.575
There was a baby.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.811
I was pregnant when I crashed.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.513
There was a baby.

17:50.537 --> 17:53.137
They gave me a c-section.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.656
Yes.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.125
He was so little.

18:03.149 --> 18:05.583
He never even took a breath.

18:13.693 --> 18:17.573
He was a beautiful
baby boy, Marissa.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.142
They put him in my arms

18:20.166 --> 18:23.012
and it felt like I was
holding you again.

18:23.036 --> 18:27.683
All those years ago.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.686
He was perfectly still.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.044
Like a doll.

18:34.948 --> 18:37.315
<i>He's gone to a better place.</i>

18:52.899 --> 19:00.899
I'm so sorry you're here.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.071
It's a girl.

19:44.918 --> 19:48.753
<i>Dr. Kravitz, you have a
visitor in the main lobby.</i>

19:59.299 --> 20:02.611
She's putting up a good front.

20:02.635 --> 20:05.314
She's clearly still in a
great deal of distress.

20:05.338 --> 20:08.150
It's good that you called me.

20:08.174 --> 20:11.587
There's something
you're not telling me.

20:11.611 --> 20:14.023
I spoke with your mother.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.791
She's worried about
you, Marissa.

20:15.815 --> 20:20.529
I don't know if you're lying
to me or trying to protect me,

20:20.553 --> 20:22.298
but there was a baby.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.966
Well, she appears to
be coming around,

20:23.990 --> 20:27.269
but if she's exposed
to a stressor,

20:27.293 --> 20:30.339
we run the risk that she
may retreat into fantasy.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.707
Marissa, I checked your file.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.409
There was a baby!

20:33.433 --> 20:39.715
My mother held him,
she buried him!

20:39.739 --> 20:41.317
That's odd.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.152
Maybe a page was missed

20:43.176 --> 20:44.820
when Dr. Novak copied
your file for me.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.722
I'll look into it.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.324
But that's not all.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.993
The baby that was in the grave?

20:51.017 --> 20:53.395
That's not my baby.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.364
My baby was a girl,

20:55.388 --> 20:57.833
and I think she may
still be still alive.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.335
What do you suggest?

20:59.359 --> 21:03.739
Maybe medication,
clonazepam for starters.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.875
Isn't that a sedative?

21:06.899 --> 21:10.679
Sometimes, when you desire
something strongly,

21:10.703 --> 21:14.183
your brain can't separate
fact from fiction.

21:14.207 --> 21:17.308
Obsession can falsify memories.

21:20.780 --> 21:24.693
So you think that's
what's happening to me?

21:24.717 --> 21:28.497
We're going to get through this.

21:28.521 --> 21:31.667
I don't know if I'm
comfortable with that.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.937
Well, maybe we could just stick
to routine monitoring for now.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.438
How routine, exactly?

21:36.462 --> 21:37.506
Well, weekly.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.675
For now.

21:39.699 --> 21:42.578
Dr. Novak, I have a matter I
want to discuss with you later.

21:42.602 --> 21:43.779
After my two o'clock.

21:43.803 --> 21:44.947
Absolutely.

21:44.971 --> 21:45.781
See you later.

21:45.805 --> 21:46.615
Bye.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.217
See you next week, Marissa.

21:48.241 --> 21:49.685
You're making great progress.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.709
<i>Thank you, doctor.</i>

21:56.149 --> 21:57.426
How'd it go?

21:57.450 --> 21:59.028
It was good.

21:59.052 --> 21:59.928
Why don't you wait here?

21:59.952 --> 22:01.196
I'll bring the car around.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.253
Okay.

22:15.501 --> 22:16.578
Your two o'clock is here.

22:16.602 --> 22:18.703
Thank you. Send him in.

22:25.678 --> 22:26.955
Excuse me.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.257
I just wanted to say thank you

22:28.281 --> 22:30.859
for holding on to my
personal belongings.

22:30.883 --> 22:35.286
They've been so helpful for
me for regaining my memory.

22:37.190 --> 22:39.902
What happened to my daughter?

22:39.926 --> 22:43.172
Your daughter?

22:43.196 --> 22:45.808
I gave birth to her
via c-section.

22:45.832 --> 22:49.567
I'm sorry, I think you've got
me mixed up with someone else.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.619
I used to smoke.

22:57.643 --> 23:02.157
But I gave it up completely
when I knew I was pregnant.

23:02.181 --> 23:04.326
Please, I need your help.

23:04.350 --> 23:06.028
I'm trying to find my daughter.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.819
I'm sorry, you've got
the wrong nurse.

23:13.960 --> 23:17.840
Isn't it high time that
we got back to greatness?

23:17.864 --> 23:19.441
Right?

23:19.465 --> 23:25.481
I think we can all agree that
status quo isn't working.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.116
You know, that someone needs

23:27.140 --> 23:31.620
to hold that one percent
accountable for their actions.

23:31.644 --> 23:32.721
Hey?

23:34.213 --> 23:36.191
<i>Well, that is exactly
what I intend to do.</i>

23:36.215 --> 23:39.061
When elected, will
lobby for jobs

23:39.085 --> 23:41.797
for the hard-working
middle class

23:41.821 --> 23:44.967
that form the backbone
of this great state.

23:48.094 --> 23:51.295
So I propose to...

24:04.254 --> 24:05.254
I...

24:10.049 --> 24:12.761
I... I propose to
lobby for jobs.

24:17.590 --> 24:18.667
Thanks for stopping by.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.536
I didn't know you
followed politics.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.571
I was just in the area.

24:22.595 --> 24:24.706
<i>Thank you so much for coming.</i>

24:24.730 --> 24:26.008
Hi, Abby.

24:26.032 --> 24:27.242
Manners, Abby.

24:27.266 --> 24:28.911
Hi.

24:28.935 --> 24:30.078
This is your aunt, Marissa.

24:30.102 --> 24:31.847
She's been away for a long time,

24:31.871 --> 24:34.271
but now you're going
to see a lot of her.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.592
Marissa. Hi.

24:43.616 --> 24:47.896
Um, Heather told me all
about your recovery.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.264
Cal.

24:49.288 --> 24:52.968
I'm sorry, I know we've
met, but I can't remember.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.603
Sweetheart, the
reporters are waiting,

24:54.627 --> 24:56.405
and we have a radio interview.

24:56.429 --> 24:57.773
Right.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.597
We should go.

25:02.268 --> 25:04.546
Heather, how old is Abby?

25:04.570 --> 25:05.414
Five.

25:05.438 --> 25:07.371
She's five.

25:12.478 --> 25:14.289
Marissa?

25:14.313 --> 25:15.290
Are you ok?

25:15.314 --> 25:16.634
You look like you've
seen a ghost.

25:16.658 --> 25:23.763
She's alive.

25:47.423 --> 25:48.423
Dr. Lapointe?

26:16.475 --> 26:18.053
Miss Davis?

26:18.077 --> 26:20.589
Did you happen to get a
good look at the assailant?

26:20.613 --> 26:21.623
No.

26:21.647 --> 26:23.592
Not for lack of trying.

26:23.616 --> 26:24.893
Ok.

26:24.917 --> 26:28.297
Well, if you think
of anything else,

26:28.321 --> 26:30.766
give me a call.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.756
Thank you.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.240
Marissa!

26:38.264 --> 26:40.742
What were you thinking?

26:40.766 --> 26:42.444
You almost got yourself killed!

26:42.468 --> 26:44.046
Look around you, mom.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.281
Doesn't it tell you I'm
getting closer to the truth?

26:46.305 --> 26:47.883
It tells me that
you're running around

26:47.907 --> 26:49.117
on a wild goose chase

26:49.141 --> 26:51.987
and you're not thinking
about your own safety.

26:52.011 --> 26:54.812
I know I'm getting closer.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.636
<i>I have some urgent news that I'd
rather not say over the phone.</i>

26:59.660 --> 27:01.296
<i>Come see me at my
office right away.</i>

27:01.320 --> 27:03.599
I bet it was one of
his crazy patients

27:03.623 --> 27:05.467
that went off their rocker.

27:05.491 --> 27:06.971
Oh, and they just
happened to kill him

27:06.995 --> 27:09.304
right after he left me
this mysterious message?

27:09.328 --> 27:13.408
Nuts can go off at any time.

27:13.432 --> 27:17.479
Come on, don't you go getting
any crazy ideas, eh?

27:17.503 --> 27:19.470
Yeah.

27:32.585 --> 27:37.087
Not crazy, but I have an idea.

27:59.812 --> 28:02.224
<i>We need him to sign off on
these before you go for lunch.</i>

28:02.248 --> 28:02.891
Oh, that's ok.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.715
I'll take that.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.267
Um, you know what?

28:12.291 --> 28:16.638
I can't sign anything else until
I get a coffee, thank you.

28:16.662 --> 28:17.706
Oh, come on.

28:17.730 --> 28:20.564
What's one more between friends?

28:23.235 --> 28:24.880
There it is again.

28:24.904 --> 28:26.704
That look.

28:29.175 --> 28:31.375
There are things that...

28:34.680 --> 28:36.024
Does everyone make
you speechless,

28:36.048 --> 28:37.492
or is it just me?

28:37.516 --> 28:39.316
Excuse me, can I help you?

28:42.354 --> 28:47.069
That's ok, the Congressman
and I go way back.

28:47.093 --> 28:49.538
It's ok.

28:49.562 --> 28:52.274
I'm sorry Miss
Davis, I'm just...

28:52.298 --> 28:55.410
I'm really busy right now.

28:55.434 --> 28:58.380
I'm sorry.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.671
It's ok.

29:08.581 --> 29:10.180
I can find my own way out.

29:21.494 --> 29:23.071
So this is where they found me.

29:23.095 --> 29:26.541
Yeah, just over there.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.210
This place gives me the creeps.

29:28.234 --> 29:29.277
Let's go.

29:29.301 --> 29:31.546
I have to pick up
Abby from daycare.

29:31.570 --> 29:34.382
You know, Ethan Fox told me
that it was a hit and run.

29:34.406 --> 29:35.383
The news guy?

29:35.407 --> 29:36.151
Mmmhmm.

29:36.175 --> 29:37.219
I would be careful of him,

29:37.243 --> 29:39.321
he doesn't have much
of a reputation.

29:39.345 --> 29:42.057
Actually, he's starting
to grow on me.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.593
Wow, this really is the
middle of nowhere.

29:44.617 --> 29:46.962
What was I even doing out here?

29:46.986 --> 29:50.966
It's definitely not
the scenic route.

29:50.990 --> 29:54.603
Maybe there was something
that drew me out here.

29:54.627 --> 29:56.460
Or someone.

29:59.165 --> 30:02.277
We had come here because
we had nowhere else to go.

30:02.301 --> 30:06.515
My dad was so sick and I
didn't want to upset my mom.

30:06.539 --> 30:09.151
This is where I was that day.

30:09.175 --> 30:12.120
The day I lost everything.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.523
Who was he?

30:14.547 --> 30:16.324
I don't know.

30:16.348 --> 30:19.327
But whoever he was, he's
the father of my baby.

30:19.351 --> 30:21.596
Maybe he knows what
happened to her.

30:21.620 --> 30:24.366
Marissa, he died.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.968
No, that's not right.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.992
My baby was a girl.

30:41.574 --> 30:42.851
Special delivery.

30:42.875 --> 30:45.654
Huh?

30:45.678 --> 30:47.455
What have you been
doing all day?

30:47.479 --> 30:48.490
Oh, you know.

30:48.514 --> 30:49.658
Out and about.

30:49.682 --> 30:51.860
The usual.

30:51.884 --> 30:54.162
What is it?

30:54.186 --> 30:56.131
Where did you find this?

30:56.155 --> 30:57.032
On the doorstep.

30:57.056 --> 30:58.700
When?

30:58.724 --> 31:00.390
A few minutes ago.

31:02.595 --> 31:04.506
Marissa!

31:04.530 --> 31:05.996
Where are you going?

31:09.335 --> 31:10.846
Marissa!

31:10.870 --> 31:12.581
Marissa, what is going on?

31:12.605 --> 31:14.716
Did you see anyone?

31:14.740 --> 31:15.517
No!

31:15.541 --> 31:18.720
What has gotten into you?

31:18.744 --> 31:19.988
Exactly this, mom.

31:20.012 --> 31:21.022
What is this?

31:21.046 --> 31:22.824
It's the day I had
the accident, mom.

31:22.848 --> 31:23.525
Look.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.861
It's her heartbeat, mom!

31:25.885 --> 31:26.728
Oh, Marissa.

31:26.752 --> 31:28.530
It's a hoax.

31:28.554 --> 31:29.865
I buried your baby.

31:29.889 --> 31:31.833
What if that was the hoax?

31:31.857 --> 31:34.035
What if they gave you
a different baby?

31:34.059 --> 31:36.404
A baby from a morgue that
no one would be missing

31:36.428 --> 31:38.773
and they put that baby in
your arms and told you

31:38.797 --> 31:41.943
it was your dead grandson and no
one would know the difference!

31:41.967 --> 31:43.178
Enough!

31:43.202 --> 31:45.413
You have to stop this fantasy!

31:45.437 --> 31:48.383
It's getting out of hand.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.019
This is not a fantasy.

31:51.043 --> 31:53.010
This is proof.

31:56.448 --> 31:57.881
Marissa.

32:02.621 --> 32:04.766
I got your message.

32:04.790 --> 32:07.102
I didn't send a message.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.225
This?

32:11.563 --> 32:14.709
I didn't send this.

32:14.733 --> 32:16.878
Tell me about my daughter.

32:16.902 --> 32:19.136
Please.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.106
Come with me.

32:32.751 --> 32:33.951
I was an OR nurse at the time.

32:35.688 --> 32:37.499
I often worked with Dr. Novak.

32:37.523 --> 32:39.968
We got along famously, which
is why I followed him

32:39.992 --> 32:44.995
to the shiny New Era Clinic
even though I knew...

32:49.368 --> 32:52.781
The paramedics said you were
pregnant so we thought,

32:52.805 --> 32:56.773
given your injuries, that
the baby would be dead.

33:03.182 --> 33:07.028
But then we detected
a fetal pulse

33:07.052 --> 33:10.498
so Dr. Novak performed
an emergency c-section.

33:10.522 --> 33:12.022
<i>She's not gonna make it.</i>

33:14.626 --> 33:18.039
And you gave birth to a
beautiful baby girl.

33:18.063 --> 33:20.508
<i>Put her on anesthetic!</i>

33:22.334 --> 33:24.779
I remember asking
someone to get your mom

33:24.803 --> 33:28.550
so she could take the baby, but Dr.
Novak said

33:28.574 --> 33:30.452
there's no point in
getting your hopes up

33:30.476 --> 33:32.787
since the baby probably
wouldn't make it.

33:32.811 --> 33:34.956
It was touch and go.

33:34.980 --> 33:36.958
She was in the
incubator for weeks.

33:36.982 --> 33:38.026
And the EKG,

33:38.050 --> 33:41.663
how did you get a hold of that?

33:41.687 --> 33:45.789
Uh, I was shredding confidential
papers and found it.

33:49.061 --> 33:52.607
I saw the fax cover page, too.

33:52.631 --> 33:57.145
It came from Dr. Lapointe's
office on the day he died.

33:57.169 --> 33:58.913
So Dr. Lapointe knew?

33:58.937 --> 34:00.697
He must have found it
in your medical records

34:00.721 --> 34:07.555
and made the mistake of
confiding in Dr. Novak.

34:07.579 --> 34:10.091
Marissa, whoever took your baby

34:10.114 --> 34:13.895
rewarded him well
for his silence.

34:13.918 --> 34:16.563
They foot the bill for
his shiny new clinic.

34:16.588 --> 34:17.899
His pride and joy.

34:17.922 --> 34:20.835
So Novak told his benefactor about Dr.
Lapointe.

34:20.859 --> 34:24.172
This isn't a game, Marissa.

34:24.196 --> 34:26.408
Be very careful.

34:26.431 --> 34:29.077
I will.

34:29.101 --> 34:31.034
Who took my baby?

34:34.406 --> 34:37.351
There was this woman,

34:37.376 --> 34:40.288
she was in the clinic at
the same time as you.

34:40.312 --> 34:43.591
Her baby was stillborn
and she was so lost.

34:43.614 --> 34:49.397
She wanted a baby so badly.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.866
I'm sure she's been
an excellent mother.

34:51.889 --> 34:54.268
The baby she lost,
was it a girl?

34:54.293 --> 34:56.103
No, a boy.

34:56.128 --> 34:58.261
A sweet little boy.

35:03.068 --> 35:05.135
They're gonna be best friends.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.794
I know who took her, mom.

35:19.818 --> 35:21.496
They're not gonna
get away with this.

35:21.520 --> 35:25.400
What are you talking about?

35:25.424 --> 35:26.334
Took who?

35:26.358 --> 35:27.268
I talked to Cynthia.

35:27.292 --> 35:29.404
<i>Cynthia who?</i>

35:29.428 --> 35:30.572
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

35:30.596 --> 35:32.273
I'm on my way to the
police station.

35:32.297 --> 35:33.408
The police?

35:33.432 --> 35:34.142
Why?

35:34.166 --> 35:36.244
I know who took my baby!

35:36.268 --> 35:38.313
Honey, your baby died.

35:38.337 --> 35:39.180
No.

35:39.204 --> 35:40.582
No, that's not what happened.

35:40.606 --> 35:43.651
Marissa, listen to me.

35:43.675 --> 35:47.155
I need you to come
home first, alright?

35:47.179 --> 35:48.623
<i>Then we'll go to the police.</i>

35:48.647 --> 35:53.695
Otherwise they're not going
to take you seriously.

35:53.719 --> 35:54.963
<i>Marissa?</i>

35:54.987 --> 35:55.864
What?

35:55.888 --> 35:57.866
Come home first.

35:57.890 --> 35:59.868
We'll figure it out.

35:59.892 --> 36:02.470
Together, ok?

36:02.494 --> 36:03.304
Yeah.

36:03.328 --> 36:04.539
Yeah, ok.

36:04.563 --> 36:05.507
I'm on my way back.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.197
Great.

36:09.368 --> 36:12.547
See?

36:12.571 --> 36:16.484
I'm so worried about her.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.486
She needs help.

36:37.329 --> 36:38.461
I remember you.

36:43.602 --> 36:46.381
Miss Davis, what's going on?

36:46.405 --> 36:48.016
You're driving like a mad woman.

36:48.040 --> 36:50.318
I'm just going home.

36:50.342 --> 36:54.889
If I'm not mistaken,
home is that way.

36:54.913 --> 36:57.425
Are you in on this, Peter?

36:57.449 --> 37:00.083
Did you help take her?

37:02.554 --> 37:06.067
Miss Davis, do you have any
idea how many conspiracy freaks

37:06.091 --> 37:08.203
I deal with on a daily basis?

37:08.227 --> 37:10.605
Congressmen are often
targeted by bored,

37:10.629 --> 37:13.241
pathetic women like you.

37:13.265 --> 37:14.042
He knows me.

37:14.066 --> 37:15.276
He knows me.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.545
He recognizes me.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.868
He loves me.

37:20.672 --> 37:28.623
Go home and keep your delusions
to yourself, Marissa.

37:28.647 --> 37:31.459
Understood?

37:31.483 --> 37:33.683
Drive safe.

37:46.265 --> 37:48.610
He just came out of nowhere.

37:48.634 --> 37:49.877
He ran you off the road?

37:49.901 --> 37:52.780
Yeah, and threatened to
report me for stalking.

37:52.804 --> 37:53.748
Stalking who?

37:53.772 --> 37:56.150
Cal.

37:56.174 --> 37:58.620
Congressman Ward?

37:58.644 --> 38:00.521
Wow, I mean, I guess he's
cute and all, but...

38:00.545 --> 38:05.727
I'm not stalking
Congressman Ward.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.428
Peter Vaughn is
connected to this.

38:07.452 --> 38:09.063
Why else would he follow me?

38:09.087 --> 38:10.727
Maybe he thinks you're
a legitimate threat

38:10.751 --> 38:12.133
to the campaign.

38:12.157 --> 38:12.834
No.

38:12.858 --> 38:13.568
He's just doing his job.

38:13.592 --> 38:14.969
No, it's more than that.

38:14.993 --> 38:16.771
So you've unlocked some
sort of conspiracy

38:16.795 --> 38:19.574
and the players are
covering themselves?

38:19.598 --> 38:22.310
I just want my daughter back.

38:22.334 --> 38:23.978
Your daughter?

38:24.002 --> 38:25.513
Abby.

38:25.537 --> 38:26.914
Abby?

38:26.938 --> 38:29.250
The Congressman's daughter?

38:29.274 --> 38:32.687
You think Ward stole
your daughter?

38:32.711 --> 38:35.145
I think she is our daughter.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.483
You think you can prove that?

39:12.484 --> 39:14.562
<i>I really would like to
have a word with her.</i>

39:14.586 --> 39:17.899
Oh, Marissa.

39:17.923 --> 39:19.967
Marissa, hello.

39:19.991 --> 39:22.203
I was sad to hear about Dr.
Lapointe,

39:22.227 --> 39:23.504
he was a good man.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.907
It must be very hard for you.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.709
How are you coping?

39:27.733 --> 39:29.711
Well enough that I didn't
expect a house call,

39:29.735 --> 39:31.179
if that's what you mean.

39:31.203 --> 39:34.982
Uh, you know Rose, I think I
will have that cup of tea.

39:35.006 --> 39:35.917
Of course.

39:35.941 --> 39:39.887
Thanks.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.556
I just need a moment.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.491
I'll cut to the chase.

39:43.515 --> 39:46.661
I read Dr. Lapointe's file.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.896
He was very concerned
about your mental state

39:48.920 --> 39:52.233
and now given recent
events I'm also concerned.

39:52.257 --> 39:53.501
Recent events?

39:53.525 --> 39:56.938
Your mother told me that
someone tried to run you

39:56.962 --> 40:01.275
off the road this morning.

40:01.299 --> 40:02.677
I was just startled.

40:02.701 --> 40:05.246
Ok.

40:05.270 --> 40:07.081
You can tell me the
truth, Marissa.

40:07.105 --> 40:08.625
Do you think someone
tried to hurt you,

40:08.649 --> 40:10.551
or do you think that
you were really

40:10.575 --> 40:12.019
just trying to hurt yourself?

40:12.043 --> 40:13.254
Excuse me?

40:13.278 --> 40:15.038
I've had patients who
have ended their lives.

40:15.062 --> 40:19.360
Really all they wanted
to do was end the pain.

40:19.384 --> 40:21.184
This is incredible.

40:23.288 --> 40:24.587
Marissa?

40:27.726 --> 40:29.092
I'm sorry.

40:36.668 --> 40:39.447
Listen, I can't lie to you.

40:39.471 --> 40:42.750
I think that Marissa's
illness is escalating.

40:42.774 --> 40:45.420
She's suffering from
paranoid delusions.

40:45.444 --> 40:48.122
She might even have
a psychotic break.

40:48.146 --> 40:51.559
I'm worried that she might
try to hurt herself again.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.027
Again?

40:53.051 --> 40:58.599
I think that she intentionally
ran herself off the road.

40:58.623 --> 41:00.835
She needs to take
these sedatives.

41:00.859 --> 41:03.271
I can't trust her with
the whole bottle.

41:03.295 --> 41:06.908
I hate to ask, but would you?

41:06.932 --> 41:09.110
It's one every four hours.

41:09.134 --> 41:10.845
Monitor her closely.

41:10.869 --> 41:13.915
Don't let her leave, otherwise
anything might happen.

41:13.939 --> 41:15.779
In the meantime, I'm going
to make arrangements

41:15.803 --> 41:18.603
to get her in
intensive treatment.

41:36.561 --> 41:38.372
What are you looking at?

41:38.396 --> 41:40.641
Oh, just an article.

41:40.665 --> 41:44.712
How to tell if your own mother
thinks you're a lunatic.

41:44.736 --> 41:47.315
I don't think that.

41:47.339 --> 41:50.651
I think you're overwhelmed.

41:50.675 --> 41:54.655
That's just a nice way
of saying crazy, mom.

41:54.679 --> 41:56.239
So have you booked me
an indefinite stay

41:56.263 --> 41:58.159
at the loony bin yet?

41:58.183 --> 42:00.294
Of course not.

42:00.318 --> 42:02.330
We're just concerned,
that's all.

42:02.354 --> 42:04.499
You don't believe me, do you?

42:04.523 --> 42:06.033
You think I'm making
all of this up?

42:06.057 --> 42:09.837
I think you're still recovering.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.239
It's good to know
where you stand.

42:11.263 --> 42:14.375
I'm on your side, Marissa.

42:14.399 --> 42:16.644
I always will be.

42:16.668 --> 42:18.012
I'm your mother.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.982
Well, then you of all people
should know how I feel.

42:21.006 --> 42:22.750
She's out there, mom.

42:22.774 --> 42:27.221
She needs me.

42:27.245 --> 42:32.894
Well then you better
get your energy up,

42:32.918 --> 42:35.329
because my granddaughter

42:35.353 --> 42:39.322
is going to need us
in fighting form.

42:42.527 --> 42:45.172
Thank you, mom.

42:45.196 --> 42:47.875
Now, you eat up,
before it gets cold.

42:47.899 --> 42:49.710
Ok.

42:49.734 --> 42:51.401
Yes, ma'am.

43:34.346 --> 43:36.079
It's a girl.

44:11.249 --> 44:12.582
Honey, I...

44:38.073 --> 44:39.153
How long has she been gone?

44:39.177 --> 44:42.156
Over an hour.

44:42.180 --> 44:43.457
Detective MacNiel.

44:43.481 --> 44:45.960
I need to put an APB out
on one of my clients.

44:45.984 --> 44:47.995
She's suicidal

44:48.019 --> 44:50.131
and she may be having
a psychotic break.

44:50.155 --> 44:51.254
What?

44:54.426 --> 44:56.059
Come on.

45:01.132 --> 45:04.578
<i>I'm here with Congressman
Ward and his wife, Heather.</i>

45:04.602 --> 45:06.747
<i>Thank you for coming
on the show today.</i>

45:06.771 --> 45:09.116
<i>Thank you for having us.</i>

45:09.140 --> 45:14.255
<i>I'm so sorry to hear about
your daughter, Abby.</i>

45:14.279 --> 45:17.591
<i>Thank you.</i>

45:17.615 --> 45:19.093
<i>Um... she um...</i>

45:19.117 --> 45:21.662
She needs a kidney transplant.

45:21.686 --> 45:23.186
<i>Oh, no.</i>

45:34.499 --> 45:37.645
<i>She is on the transplant list</i>

45:37.669 --> 45:41.315
<i>so we're hoping she gets
a kidney very soon.</i>

45:41.339 --> 45:43.684
She has a rare
hereditary condition

45:43.708 --> 45:46.420
called Elport Syndrome.

45:52.116 --> 45:54.161
<i>Are you sure you still want
to run for re-election</i>

45:54.185 --> 45:56.163
<i>given your daughter's condition?</i>

45:56.187 --> 46:00.534
Family is my first priority.

46:00.558 --> 46:03.237
And there are a lot of families
out there going through

46:03.261 --> 46:07.975
<i>rough patches worse than
what we are right now.</i>

46:07.999 --> 46:11.512
<i>And I just want them to know
that I'm there for them.</i>

46:11.536 --> 46:15.404
Just like I am for little Abby.

46:20.779 --> 46:23.090
Ethan Fox, if I can't get you
on the news, no one can.

46:23.114 --> 46:23.691
Hey.

46:23.715 --> 46:24.658
It's coma girl.

46:24.682 --> 46:26.227
Still want my story?

46:26.251 --> 46:27.828
Uh, are you serious?

46:27.852 --> 46:28.863
Yes!

46:28.887 --> 46:30.564
Alright, bring all
your camera gear.

46:30.588 --> 46:31.899
I want this to go viral.

46:31.923 --> 46:34.568
Miss Davis.

46:34.592 --> 46:37.171
How are you doing today?

46:37.195 --> 46:39.206
Uh, Marissa?

46:39.230 --> 46:40.708
You're on the news.

46:40.732 --> 46:42.498
We need you to come with us.

46:48.439 --> 46:51.040
We've got the suspect
going down Brodder.

47:21.973 --> 47:24.251
Yeah, how far away?

47:24.275 --> 47:25.386
Really?

47:25.410 --> 47:28.122
Ok, well, thanks
again Detective.

47:28.146 --> 47:32.560
Thanks for the update.

47:32.584 --> 47:34.662
Rose.

47:34.686 --> 47:36.564
Are you ok?

47:36.588 --> 47:39.433
The stress is getting
to me I guess.

47:39.457 --> 47:41.335
They spotted her
ten blocks away.

47:41.359 --> 47:44.071
She gave them the slip
but she's still ok.

47:44.095 --> 47:45.773
Now she knows we
called the police.

47:45.797 --> 47:47.074
It's ok, Rose.

47:47.098 --> 47:49.065
We're doing the right thing.

47:53.271 --> 47:56.505
You know, I think I know
something that might help.

48:02.046 --> 48:04.024
Yeah, I know.

48:04.048 --> 48:07.528
I saw it.

48:07.552 --> 48:11.532
Don't worry, I'll fix it.

48:11.556 --> 48:14.268
Thomas, excuse me.

48:22.200 --> 48:24.033
I'll call you back.

48:27.972 --> 48:31.185
<i>Breaking News... Police are
looking for Marissa Davis.</i>

48:31.209 --> 48:34.822
<i>She recently fled her home and was
last spotted in the downtown core.</i>

48:34.846 --> 48:38.158
<i>She is mentally unstable
and highly unpredictable.</i>

48:38.182 --> 48:40.027
Her family released
this message:

48:40.051 --> 48:43.864
I know you're scared, but
you need to come home.

48:43.888 --> 48:46.200
<i>I love you.</i>

48:46.224 --> 48:47.902
It's only been three years

48:47.926 --> 48:50.893
since I lost your father
to kidney failure.

48:54.766 --> 48:57.378
Hey, could you deliver
something for me?

48:57.402 --> 48:58.846
It's really urgent.

48:58.870 --> 49:00.514
Depends if it's on my route.

49:00.538 --> 49:01.382
Uh, yeah.

49:01.406 --> 49:02.082
That's on my route.

49:02.106 --> 49:02.983
Great.

49:03.007 --> 49:04.640
Do you have an extra envelope?

49:06.945 --> 49:10.257
Thanks.

49:10.281 --> 49:14.495
Please, let me help you.

49:14.519 --> 49:16.397
I know you think you're
doing the right thing.

49:16.421 --> 49:17.364
This story keeps getting better.

49:17.388 --> 49:20.601
But you're not well.

49:20.625 --> 49:22.591
Oh, that's great.

49:24.462 --> 49:25.739
That was Rose Davis.

49:25.763 --> 49:27.043
The mother of the missing woman.

49:27.067 --> 49:27.610
<i>We'll be sure to
keep you posted.</i>

49:27.634 --> 49:29.743
Is that you?

49:29.767 --> 49:31.745
It sure looks like you.

49:31.769 --> 49:34.515
Yeah, it kinda does, huh?

49:34.539 --> 49:36.038
Creepy.

49:38.910 --> 49:41.043
Make sure he gets it.

49:59.474 --> 50:00.874
I'm not sure if
you've noticed this,

50:00.898 --> 50:01.909
but you're a fugitive!

50:01.933 --> 50:03.877
Try not to sound so excited.

50:03.901 --> 50:05.245
Are you kidding?

50:05.269 --> 50:06.447
This is the best thing
that's ever happened to me!

50:06.471 --> 50:08.048
I've got cops in my office.

50:08.072 --> 50:09.316
This must be some story.

50:09.340 --> 50:11.251
Whatever you do,
stay away from them.

50:11.275 --> 50:13.454
They're just trying to
find out what you know.

50:13.478 --> 50:14.288
Well, the joke's on them.

50:14.312 --> 50:15.756
You've kept me in the dark.

50:15.780 --> 50:17.725
You know where I'll be tonight.

50:17.749 --> 50:19.727
You sure that place is secure?

50:19.751 --> 50:23.230
It's no fortress,
but it's discreet.

50:23.254 --> 50:24.798
Hey, thanks, by the way.

50:24.822 --> 50:27.501
I think you may be the only
person I can trust right now.

50:27.525 --> 50:31.572
That's when you know
you've hit rock bottom.

50:31.596 --> 50:32.506
Yeah.

50:32.530 --> 50:34.130
Bye.

50:49.981 --> 50:52.993
I have something to show you.

50:53.017 --> 50:55.329
That's amazing!

50:55.353 --> 50:56.764
Cal, you're not thinking.

50:56.788 --> 50:58.265
I love you.

50:58.289 --> 51:01.368
I love you too, but an
unmarried Congressman,

51:01.392 --> 51:02.503
a baby on the way?

51:02.527 --> 51:04.104
I didn't plan for this either.

51:04.128 --> 51:05.773
But you walked into my life.

51:05.797 --> 51:07.808
What am I supposed to do?

51:07.832 --> 51:09.009
Risk losing you?

51:09.033 --> 51:10.611
Out of the question.

51:10.635 --> 51:13.514
I followed my heart and
I have no regrets.

51:13.538 --> 51:14.648
Especially now.

51:14.672 --> 51:17.017
Oh my god.

51:17.041 --> 51:19.787
I love you so much.

51:19.811 --> 51:23.312
And I'm gonna make this
right for all of us.

51:29.353 --> 51:32.800
You're more beautiful than
the first day I saw you.

51:32.824 --> 51:35.702
I got your message.

51:35.726 --> 51:37.793
And this.

51:41.599 --> 51:44.311
God, I missed you so much.

51:44.335 --> 51:47.014
I- I lost you, and I
had a little girl

51:47.038 --> 51:49.883
that needed a mother.

51:49.907 --> 51:51.251
And Heather had
just lost her baby

51:51.275 --> 51:53.075
and the doctor said she
couldn't have another,

51:53.099 --> 51:58.258
so what was I supposed to do?

51:58.282 --> 52:00.260
She begged me to stay with her

52:00.284 --> 52:04.531
so that we could
raise Abby together.

52:04.555 --> 52:08.735
She wanted a baby so much.

52:08.759 --> 52:14.908
And then you had the
perfect little family.

52:14.932 --> 52:19.279
That's how you won the election.

52:19.303 --> 52:21.837
How could you do that to me?

52:23.941 --> 52:26.086
I didn't do it for the election.

52:26.110 --> 52:27.354
I did it for Abby!

52:27.378 --> 52:29.890
Listen, she needed a mother.

52:29.914 --> 52:31.125
The doctor said he didn't know

52:31.149 --> 52:35.028
if you were gonna
come out of the coma.

52:35.052 --> 52:37.464
And here was this
tiny little girl,

52:37.488 --> 52:40.267
this tiny piece of you
that I could hold on to

52:40.291 --> 52:42.970
that was ready to come
home from the hospital.

52:42.994 --> 52:44.905
And what about my mother?

52:44.929 --> 52:46.329
Don't you think she
would have liked

52:46.353 --> 52:48.408
a tiny little piece
of me to hold on to?

52:48.432 --> 52:50.944
When she thought she
had lost everything?

52:50.968 --> 52:53.547
Marissa, your father
was really sick.

52:53.571 --> 52:57.417
I didn't want to add
to her troubles.

52:57.441 --> 53:00.687
I still don't know how
you pulled it off.

53:00.711 --> 53:04.413
How did nobody know
that you had my baby?

53:09.687 --> 53:13.767
Heather's family owned a clinic,

53:13.791 --> 53:18.605
and that's where they took
you after the accident.

53:18.629 --> 53:19.749
Heather was the one who paid

53:19.773 --> 53:23.443
for your private care
all these years.

53:23.467 --> 53:25.179
She's a saint.

53:25.203 --> 53:25.946
Listen to me.

53:25.970 --> 53:27.981
Listen!

53:28.005 --> 53:31.118
Dr. Novak agreed that Abby
would be better off with me

53:31.142 --> 53:32.719
than some stranger

53:32.743 --> 53:37.925
so he was willing to turn a
blind eye to keep the secret.

53:37.949 --> 53:41.361
And just how far would
he go for that secret?

53:41.385 --> 53:43.664
Would he kill for it?

53:43.688 --> 53:46.099
What? No!

53:46.123 --> 53:48.702
What are you talking about?

53:48.726 --> 53:50.837
I love you!

53:50.861 --> 53:56.109
I was only doing the best for
everyone, especially Abby.

53:56.133 --> 53:58.812
Because right now she needs you.

53:58.836 --> 54:00.669
She needs us.

54:03.241 --> 54:05.374
She's sick.

54:13.884 --> 54:15.862
She needs a kidney.

54:15.886 --> 54:23.886
I'm not a match
but you might be.

54:24.395 --> 54:32.395
Marissa, I... I
know I screwed up.

54:32.670 --> 54:38.986
Would you be willing
to take the test?

54:39.010 --> 54:42.723
Yes... yes, of course.

54:42.747 --> 54:43.357
Let's go.

54:43.381 --> 54:44.157
No, no, no.

54:44.181 --> 54:45.325
You're all over the news,

54:45.349 --> 54:47.427
we can't just walk
through the front door.

54:47.451 --> 54:48.428
Do you have a safe place to stay

54:48.452 --> 54:50.519
until I can make
some arrangements?

55:03.534 --> 55:07.614
I'll be there tonight.

55:07.638 --> 55:10.039
I really need you.

55:54.552 --> 55:56.685
I'll be seeing you soon.

56:00.725 --> 56:01.935
Police.

56:01.959 --> 56:05.472
Miss Davis, Miss Davis,
we just want to talk.

56:05.496 --> 56:06.373
Open it now, come on!

56:06.397 --> 56:07.463
Open it!

56:17.575 --> 56:18.640
Clear.

56:23.647 --> 56:24.647
Ahhhhhh!!!!!!

56:54.422 --> 56:55.422
Oh, my!

56:55.446 --> 56:57.257
I said no harm.

56:57.281 --> 56:59.926
You're lucky she didn't
sustain any head trauma.

56:59.950 --> 57:01.461
What does it matter?

57:01.485 --> 57:03.597
It's not like we need the brain.

57:03.621 --> 57:06.099
Where am I?

57:06.123 --> 57:07.134
Just relax.

57:07.158 --> 57:08.558
We're just going to
run a few tests.

57:08.582 --> 57:10.337
What... What?

57:10.361 --> 57:12.372
Easy.

57:12.396 --> 57:14.875
Tests? For what?

57:14.899 --> 57:16.042
For Abby?

57:16.066 --> 57:17.444
For the kidney?

57:17.468 --> 57:20.213
Something like that.

57:20.237 --> 57:21.948
Where is she?

57:21.972 --> 57:23.049
Where's my daughter?

57:23.073 --> 57:24.807
We'll be right back.

57:26.243 --> 57:27.609
Wha...

57:31.682 --> 57:33.293
Where's Abby?!

57:33.317 --> 57:37.531
Wait!

57:37.555 --> 57:38.954
What?

57:46.931 --> 57:48.330
Marissa?

57:50.835 --> 57:52.712
Sit.

57:52.736 --> 57:55.215
A must-see before the election.

57:55.239 --> 57:56.383
Care to elaborate?

57:56.407 --> 57:57.784
I don't know.

57:57.808 --> 58:03.356
Like I said, she told
me what to tweet.

58:03.380 --> 58:04.791
Now the only story I have is

58:04.815 --> 58:11.097
"reporter's reputation dies
in a seedy motel room".

58:11.121 --> 58:12.265
Are we done here?

58:12.289 --> 58:14.690
We're done when I
say we're done.

58:27.271 --> 58:28.670
What are you doing here?

58:32.687 --> 58:33.687
What is this?

58:33.711 --> 58:37.290
Say hello to your granddaughter.

58:37.314 --> 58:39.926
This is Cal and
Heather's daughter.

58:39.950 --> 58:42.429
This is the secret Marissa
was going to expose.

58:42.453 --> 58:44.698
Right before she got nabbed.

58:44.722 --> 58:46.002
It would have been
a great story.

58:46.026 --> 58:49.402
So you believe her?

58:49.426 --> 58:50.203
Yeah.

58:50.227 --> 58:51.538
Do you know where she is?

58:51.562 --> 58:53.139
The police don't have her.

58:53.163 --> 58:54.941
Do you know a Peter Vaughn?

58:54.965 --> 58:57.043
What are you doing?

58:57.067 --> 58:59.279
There's something
you don't know.

58:59.303 --> 59:00.814
It's Cal.

59:00.838 --> 59:03.083
Cal and Marissa were engaged
before the accident.

59:03.107 --> 59:05.886
Peter Vaughn is Cal's
best friend from college.

59:05.910 --> 59:09.389
He... he's his head of
security right now.

59:09.413 --> 59:12.259
Rose, these people,
they're dangerous.

59:12.283 --> 59:14.995
Maybe you should stay here
in case Marissa calls.

59:15.019 --> 59:16.752
Ok.

59:45.950 --> 59:48.194
Marissa, my darling, what
have they done to you?

59:48.218 --> 59:50.430
Just stay away from me.

59:50.454 --> 59:52.532
Marissa, please.

59:52.556 --> 59:53.600
You've lied to me.

59:53.624 --> 59:54.834
No, I-I didn't-

59:54.858 --> 59:56.102
You told me you were
bringing me to my daughter.

59:56.126 --> 59:57.938
This is not exactly the
venue I had in mind

59:57.962 --> 59:59.162
for a mother-daughter reunion.

59:59.186 --> 01:00:03.843
I had nothing to do with this.

01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:04.578
Marissa, please.

01:00:04.602 --> 01:00:10.784
I want to help you.

01:00:10.808 --> 01:00:13.642
I just... I want
us to be together.

01:00:20.384 --> 01:00:22.295
What about Heather?

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:24.786
She knows I've always loved you.

01:00:35.666 --> 01:00:37.366
You're a perfect match.

01:00:44.341 --> 01:00:47.220
You can save her, Marissa.

01:00:47.244 --> 01:00:50.390
You slept with her.

01:00:50.414 --> 01:00:51.891
When we were engaged.

01:00:51.915 --> 01:00:53.014
I had no choice.

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:55.395
What was I supposed to do?

01:00:55.419 --> 01:01:01.089
It-it was before, it was
an accident, I had been...

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:06.172
I was drinking.

01:01:06.196 --> 01:01:08.274
It's ok.

01:01:08.298 --> 01:01:09.542
You need to go.

01:01:09.566 --> 01:01:12.367
Marissa and I have a few
things to talk about.

01:01:16.117 --> 01:01:17.117
Please.

01:01:17.141 --> 01:01:18.874
Go check on Abby.

01:01:25.883 --> 01:01:27.683
Just go.

01:01:39.997 --> 01:01:42.475
You weren't supposed to wake up.

01:01:42.499 --> 01:01:45.111
Our life was perfect.

01:01:45.135 --> 01:01:47.280
Cal is going to be Senator.

01:01:47.304 --> 01:01:50.216
We have a beautiful house
and a beautiful daughter.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.820
My daughter!

01:01:53.844 --> 01:01:58.591
I want you to know
that I love Abby.

01:01:58.615 --> 01:02:03.096
I love her just as much as
I loved my own baby boy.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.734
And I will love her just
as much after you're gone.

01:02:07.758 --> 01:02:10.470
I'm not going anywhere.

01:02:10.494 --> 01:02:12.839
Oh, you have to.

01:02:12.863 --> 01:02:16.509
You'll ruin everything.

01:02:16.533 --> 01:02:19.735
It really did work
out perfectly.

01:02:22.272 --> 01:02:24.617
The hit and run.

01:02:24.641 --> 01:02:26.986
You were there.

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:29.122
You tried to kill me.

01:02:29.146 --> 01:02:32.180
That really was an accident.

01:02:52.202 --> 01:02:54.948
Please, let me see Abby
before you do this.

01:02:54.972 --> 01:02:56.983
Let me tell her that I love her.

01:02:57.007 --> 01:03:00.487
You're giving her
such a greater gift.

01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:03.323
The gift of life.

01:03:03.347 --> 01:03:05.225
And then you will
finally go away

01:03:05.249 --> 01:03:07.861
and everything can
go back to normal.

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:10.230
Cal is going to be Senator.

01:03:10.254 --> 01:03:12.465
Maybe more.

01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:14.901
There is no telling
what we can do.

01:03:14.925 --> 01:03:17.370
How far we can go.

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:18.805
Especially with a sick child

01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:21.541
who is coming back from
the brink of death.

01:03:21.565 --> 01:03:24.377
How are you feeling, princess?

01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:26.301
Daddy, I'm scared.

01:03:29.316 --> 01:03:30.316
Don't be scared.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.986
You be brave, ok?

01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:33.720
Ok.

01:03:33.744 --> 01:03:35.221
Ok.

01:03:35.245 --> 01:03:37.590
Alright, perfect.

01:03:37.614 --> 01:03:39.692
I need you to get
set up right here.

01:03:39.716 --> 01:03:41.516
Make sure we get the girl
in the shot, please.

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:43.051
Ok, we're gonna
take that live feed

01:03:43.075 --> 01:03:45.698
and we'll be on in
three, two, one.

01:03:45.722 --> 01:03:49.402
I'm here at a surgical
clinic with Congressman Ward

01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:51.159
and his daughter, Abby.

01:03:54.364 --> 01:03:57.877
We've just received word that
a new kidney is on the way.

01:03:57.901 --> 01:04:00.880
Um, yes, thank you, Jake.

01:04:00.904 --> 01:04:04.517
We're going to televise
Abby's kidney transplant,

01:04:04.541 --> 01:04:06.386
and when she pulls through,

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:11.724
the voters will be so elated
they'll run to the polls.

01:04:11.748 --> 01:04:15.228
And guess who they're
gonna vote for?

01:04:15.252 --> 01:04:16.685
You're crazy.

01:04:24.394 --> 01:04:29.475
Now you're going to go to
sleep and not wake up.

01:04:29.499 --> 01:04:31.244
Bye, Marissa.

01:04:31.268 --> 01:04:32.612
You don't have to do this.

01:04:32.636 --> 01:04:33.713
I do love you.

01:04:33.737 --> 01:04:35.715
I would happily give
Abby my kidney,

01:04:35.739 --> 01:04:37.272
all you had to do was ask!

01:04:46.783 --> 01:04:49.217
I'm not gonna let
you ruin my family.

01:04:52.189 --> 01:04:54.500
Make sure she's dead this time.

01:04:54.524 --> 01:04:55.724
Yup.

01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:10.939
Great.

01:05:14.378 --> 01:05:15.688
Mrs. Ward?

01:05:15.712 --> 01:05:17.312
We'd love to get in a
quick word with you

01:05:17.336 --> 01:05:18.813
and the Congressman if we could.

01:05:18.837 --> 01:05:19.859
Of course.

01:05:19.883 --> 01:05:21.683
Terrific.

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:28.001
This dose is high enough
to knock out a rhino.

01:05:28.025 --> 01:05:29.702
I don't want to knock it out.

01:05:29.726 --> 01:05:31.404
I want to kill it.

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:32.639
Like you killed Lapointe?

01:05:35.766 --> 01:05:37.710
We have an uninvited guest.

01:05:37.734 --> 01:05:39.579
That reporter.

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:42.582
I need you to deal
with him discreetly.

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:43.705
Got it.

01:05:45.819 --> 01:05:46.819
Keep at it.

01:05:46.843 --> 01:05:47.754
I'll be back.

01:05:47.778 --> 01:05:49.244
Mmmhmm.

01:05:56.196 --> 01:05:57.196
Help!

01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.220
Someone help me!

01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:02.924
You understand?

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:08.263
Marissa!

01:06:12.536 --> 01:06:13.868
Can I help you?

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.373
That's what I thought.

01:06:21.912 --> 01:06:24.390
That's good.

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:26.915
Much better.

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:32.532
What happened to Cynthia?

01:06:32.556 --> 01:06:33.599
Your nurse?

01:06:33.623 --> 01:06:35.468
Cynthia?

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:37.637
I had to let her go.

01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:39.872
She was so unreliable.

01:06:39.896 --> 01:06:43.031
You do know it was her that kept
you asleep all those years.

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:51.317
But then she wanted out.

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:54.921
And here you are.

01:06:54.945 --> 01:06:57.223
Let's start, shall we?

01:06:57.247 --> 01:07:00.126
Let's have a little mood music.

and isn't going to make it.

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:18.363

became available.

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:08.694
No.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:10.162
Well, she won't go far.

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:23.030

of the news team.

Please, don't shoot.

01:13:46.556 --> 01:13:48.734
Marissa, give Abby to me.

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:49.935
I can't do that.

What are you hoping to
accomplish from this?

01:13:51.703 --> 01:13:53.005
You've lost.

01:13:53.029 --> 01:13:55.541
Abby will die if you don't
give her your kidney.

01:13:55.565 --> 01:13:56.609
You're gonna come with us

01:13:56.633 --> 01:13:58.210
and get back on that
operating table.

01:13:58.234 --> 01:13:59.178
Not like this.

01:13:59.202 --> 01:14:01.013
You know we can just take it.

01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:03.215
You're the bad guy, aren't you?

01:14:03.239 --> 01:14:04.950
Abby, come to mommy.

01:14:04.974 --> 01:14:05.718

01:14:05.742 --> 01:14:06.886
This is taking to long.

01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:08.187
She's sick, Peter.

01:14:08.211 --> 01:14:09.855
If she dies, Cal gets
the sympathy vote.

01:14:09.879 --> 01:14:10.589
Win-win.

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:12.079

If you love Cal you
won't do this.

01:14:46.182 --> 01:14:48.260
I've done everything for him.

01:14:48.284 --> 01:14:50.396
If it weren't for me and
the sacrifices I made,

01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:53.065
he never would have been
elected Congressman.

01:14:53.089 --> 01:14:54.433
And he loves me for it.

01:14:54.457 --> 01:14:55.634
No.

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:58.337
He is loyal to you,
but that is not love.

01:14:58.361 --> 01:15:00.306
I suppose he loves you then.

01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:02.063
Heather, just let it go!

01:15:12.308 --> 01:15:14.286

01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:15.921

are you doing?

01:15:40.069 --> 01:15:42.615
Daddy!

01:15:42.639 --> 01:15:43.449

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:51.457

Daddy! No!

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:54.994

01:15:55.018 --> 01:15:58.731
Don't do this, Pete!

01:15:58.755 --> 01:15:59.565
Sorry, bud.

01:15:59.589 --> 01:16:01.166
Do not touch her.

01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:03.630
Heather, I know how sad you must
have been to lose Cal's baby.

01:16:03.654 --> 01:16:05.453
I know.

01:16:08.097 --> 01:16:10.709
You told her he was Cal's?

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:14.547
No, I... it's not important now!

01:16:14.571 --> 01:16:15.648
Why?

01:16:15.672 --> 01:16:17.249
I've done everything for you.

01:16:17.273 --> 01:16:18.906
Everything you've asked.

01:16:24.614 --> 01:16:26.525
No in, no out.

01:16:28.084 --> 01:16:31.196

Ethan Fox's smart phone.

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:33.198
Fox is live on the scene-

family hostage at gun point.</i>

01:16:47.971 --> 01:16:51.350
I still just don't
understand why.

01:16:51.374 --> 01:16:52.384
Look at him.

01:16:52.408 --> 01:16:55.721
He could never
have been Senator.

01:16:55.745 --> 01:16:58.023
Abby, come to mommy.

01:16:58.047 --> 01:17:00.559
Just close your eyes.

01:17:11.294 --> 01:17:15.307
Cal, shoot her!

01:17:15.331 --> 01:17:18.811
Does someone want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

01:17:18.835 --> 01:17:22.314
She is like the one-night
stand that wouldn't go away.

01:17:22.338 --> 01:17:24.650
Shoot her!

01:17:24.674 --> 01:17:26.074

feelings for her.

up our family.

You're gonna give up everything?

01:17:40.456 --> 01:17:42.156
Cal, don't.

01:17:43.092 --> 01:17:47.806
Cal.

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:49.141

01:18:10.553 --> 01:18:11.430
No, we're staying on this.

01:18:11.454 --> 01:18:13.087
Just push in and hold.

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:37.045
No!

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:08.754
Are you ok?

01:19:08.778 --> 01:19:09.722
I think so.

01:19:09.746 --> 01:19:11.757
Is daddy going to be ok?

01:19:11.781 --> 01:19:14.226
Yeah, he's a big boy.

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:15.661
He'll be fine.

01:19:15.685 --> 01:19:17.863
Is daddy gonna win the election?

01:19:20.022 --> 01:19:21.867
I don't know.

01:19:21.891 --> 01:19:23.657
Maybe he will.

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:29.764
Come on.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:40.374
Marissa...

01:19:41.921 --> 01:19:42.921
Marissa?

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:43.856
Hmm-mm.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:46.358
Are you really my mom?

01:19:46.382 --> 01:19:48.427
Yes, sweetheart.

01:19:48.451 --> 01:19:50.417
I'm really your mom.

01:20:03.733 --> 01:20:08.981
Abby, I want you to meet Rose.

01:20:09.005 --> 01:20:11.550
My little angel.

01:20:11.574 --> 01:20:14.241
Can I have one of those hugs?

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:22.060
Yeah.

01:20:22.084 --> 01:20:23.495
Alright.

01:20:23.519 --> 01:20:27.633
Alright, I need to get
you two to the hospital.

01:20:27.657 --> 01:20:29.623
Give me one minute.

01:20:43.372 --> 01:20:45.417
Standing by.

01:20:45.441 --> 01:20:47.986
Ethan?

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:48.654
Hey.

01:20:48.678 --> 01:20:50.355
Thank you.

01:20:50.379 --> 01:20:52.991
I never would have found
Abby without you.

01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:54.960
You're a pretty good shot.

01:20:54.984 --> 01:20:56.628
We're a pretty good team.

01:20:56.652 --> 01:20:58.772
Interested in becoming a
photographer for an intrepid,

01:20:58.796 --> 01:21:00.933
earnest reporter?

01:21:00.957 --> 01:21:03.702
Or a bodyguard?

01:21:03.726 --> 01:21:07.439
Or dinner?

01:21:07.463 --> 01:21:10.609
I'll get back to you.

01:21:10.633 --> 01:21:13.478
Your public awaits.

01:21:13.502 --> 01:21:15.147
It's not over, is it?

01:21:15.171 --> 01:21:17.471
Your story.

01:21:26.549 --> 01:21:28.849
I think there's more to tell.

01:21:38.995 --> 01:21:40.405
Ok, we're gonna
take that live feed

01:21:40.429 --> 01:21:43.575
and be on in three, two, one.

01:21:43.599 --> 01:21:45.559
I'm standing in front of
the Novak Medical Centre,

01:21:45.583 --> 01:21:47.379
the scene tonight of
a violent stand-off

01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:50.415
involving Congressman
Ward, his wife,

01:21:50.439 --> 01:21:52.973
and a woman who would not
give up on her daughter.

01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:57.578
For Channel 3 News,
I'm Ethan Fox.
