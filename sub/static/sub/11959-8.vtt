00:18.070 --> 00:21.000
My brother wants to hear
France's terms for peace.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.309
This is good news.

00:25.380 --> 00:28.339
Majesty, now is the time to tell
the King about our negotiating...

00:28.340 --> 00:29.450
He is not well enough.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.581
- That is precisely why we need to...
- Not yet.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.509
Your physician says
a sip is enough, Majesty.

00:43.390 --> 00:44.450
Louis...

00:46.420 --> 00:47.450
Enough.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.320
It hurts.

01:00.017 --> 01:01.360
Can you make it stop?

01:02.410 --> 01:03.420
No.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.400
But I will not leave your side.

01:14.370 --> 01:15.450
Please, Aramis...

01:18.480 --> 01:20.300
One more time.

01:29.719 --> 01:31.689
As soon as we have the
Spanish terms we go to him,

01:31.714 --> 01:33.784
this is becoming too dangerous.

01:36.246 --> 01:38.430
The Ambassador expects you at dawn.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.440
Seems in order.

01:58.450 --> 02:02.410
So, these are the
murderous Spanish generals?

02:02.420 --> 02:05.310
I trust they were handed over
without incident?

02:05.390 --> 02:06.450
Mmm.

02:06.553 --> 02:07.582
And now they are yours.

02:07.607 --> 02:08.607
Mmm.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.340
Easy.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.499
Easy!

02:17.500 --> 02:21.350
Spanish or not, they're still
prisoners of war, Marcheaux!

02:21.360 --> 02:24.510
- Hey.
- Treat them as you'd wish to be treated.

02:24.903 --> 02:28.803
Hundreds of French soldiers were
slaughtered in their custody.

02:29.500 --> 02:31.470
But they deserve better from us.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.370
Don't they?

02:34.420 --> 02:36.330
Until they hang.

02:39.380 --> 02:42.934
Oh, there'll be hell to pay if the people's
thirst for justice isn't appeased.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.247
_

04:15.465 --> 04:16.904
_

04:42.643 --> 04:45.034
_

04:47.619 --> 04:49.390
_

04:51.480 --> 04:53.360
I came to talk peace.

04:57.818 --> 04:59.748
There is no peace.

05:50.734 --> 05:53.434

06:08.310 --> 06:09.430
Lorraine was right.

06:10.477 --> 06:12.477
She's been negotiating with Spain.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.520
Well?

06:14.530 --> 06:17.340
What does the bitch ask of her brother?

06:19.460 --> 06:22.300
It doesn't matter what she asks for.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.310
He will never answer.

06:28.420 --> 06:29.490
But we will.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.370
Majesty?

06:54.276 --> 06:55.296
Sire?

07:01.390 --> 07:03.300
The King is not with you, Majesty?

07:03.480 --> 07:04.480
No.

07:05.998 --> 07:07.310
Is something wrong?

07:13.500 --> 07:15.151
Where's Aramis?

07:15.176 --> 07:17.790
He left the garrison at dusk.
No one has seen him since.

07:17.815 --> 07:19.540
I will deal with him in due course.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.175
The King is missing.

07:21.206 --> 07:22.380
He isn't in the palace?

07:22.390 --> 07:23.530
No, he isn't.

07:23.540 --> 07:25.459
Search the gardens.

07:25.460 --> 07:27.300
And do it quickly.

07:27.310 --> 07:28.526
His Majesty is already unwell.

07:28.551 --> 07:30.300
This cold air could finish him off.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.470
Louis.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.676
Louis.

07:55.080 --> 07:56.160
Rest.

08:13.480 --> 08:14.824
A snail?

08:16.569 --> 08:18.659
My garden has snails in it.

08:24.433 --> 08:25.443
Beautiful.

08:31.948 --> 08:33.198
Here!

08:47.352 --> 08:48.392
Majesty?

08:49.545 --> 08:50.707
Your Majesty?

08:51.101 --> 08:52.981
Majesty?

08:55.530 --> 08:57.449
She's angry with me.

08:57.450 --> 08:59.299
Your Majesty?

09:03.360 --> 09:04.844
She's still the most beautiful woman

09:04.869 --> 09:06.380
I've ever seen, you know?

09:07.410 --> 09:09.134
Who, Majesty?

09:11.466 --> 09:14.396
Milady de Winter.

09:21.241 --> 09:23.811
The physician gave him
a new medicine for his pain.

09:23.836 --> 09:24.841
He's taken too much.

09:24.866 --> 09:26.339
An opiate.

09:26.340 --> 09:27.741
A very powerful one.

09:27.766 --> 09:29.399
It can cause delusions.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.636
Let's get him back into the warm.

09:31.661 --> 09:32.661
Here.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.804
What happens when he
starts seeing the Cardinal?

09:56.805 --> 09:58.665
I hear you saw my home?

10:05.530 --> 10:07.330
Your mother.

10:08.530 --> 10:10.380
Mother...

10:13.908 --> 10:15.898
Brutalised by soldiers.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.340
Day after day.

10:19.350 --> 10:21.330
Night after night.

10:28.221 --> 10:29.490
She was weak.

10:30.490 --> 10:31.490
No.

10:33.082 --> 10:34.380
She was strong.

10:46.350 --> 10:47.770
She had some of these.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.950
They did not protect her.

10:52.410 --> 10:55.310
It cannot protect you from others.

10:55.470 --> 10:57.340
Only from yourself.

10:58.056 --> 10:59.939
Then you do not need them.

11:06.002 --> 11:08.912
When the Queen has met my demands

11:09.350 --> 11:11.370
you should not fear God

11:12.585 --> 11:14.485
or yourself.

11:17.420 --> 11:19.300
Only me.

11:23.860 --> 11:25.363
Rest now, Sire.

11:25.388 --> 11:26.428
Mmm.

11:54.593 --> 11:56.692
The King is back in his chambers.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.860
The physician says
he'll improve with rest.

12:08.416 --> 12:09.496
You need to see this.

12:13.448 --> 12:14.970
This bears the seal of Madrid?

12:22.389 --> 12:24.349
You've been negotiating with them?

12:24.374 --> 12:27.108
They want the Spanish prisoners
in return for Aramis.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.830
You've seen the King's condition.

12:30.288 --> 12:31.864
Why did you not inform me?

12:31.889 --> 12:35.077
- There has to be peace.
- Yes, there does.

12:35.585 --> 12:37.340
But it is not your place to ask for it.

12:37.365 --> 12:38.698
You are not yet the Regent.

12:38.723 --> 12:41.340
I am still your queen, Treville.

12:41.365 --> 12:43.680
And you may just
have cost Aramis his life.

13:10.640 --> 13:13.580
Releasing the Spaniards
would deliver a devastating blow

13:13.590 --> 13:15.305
to Your Majesty's reputation.

13:15.330 --> 13:16.540
They're due to hang tomorrow.

13:17.079 --> 13:18.539
You'd abandon Aramis?

13:18.540 --> 13:19.882
He'd expect us to.

13:19.907 --> 13:22.670
Either that or have
the people turn against you.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.570
Aramis had made two journeys
before without incident.

13:25.580 --> 13:26.758
There was no reason to suspect...

13:26.783 --> 13:28.838
The Spanish are our enemy.

13:31.690 --> 13:33.010
I'm sorry, Majesty.

13:33.035 --> 13:36.540
I have been a French queen longer
than I was ever a Spanish princess.

13:39.140 --> 13:41.670
Philip is testing my resolve for peace.

13:41.915 --> 13:44.875
If I show him I am willing
to make such a bold gesture,

13:44.900 --> 13:47.244
however damaging to my own interests,

13:48.575 --> 13:51.238
he'll see my sincerity
and we can end the war.

13:51.263 --> 13:53.283
Maybe his work will already be done.

13:53.308 --> 13:56.328
Are you suggesting my own
brother intends to harm me?

13:56.353 --> 13:58.520
- Possibly.
- Unless there's someone else?

14:00.357 --> 14:01.427
- So...
- Majesty...

14:05.012 --> 14:08.041
Is such dishonourable behaviour
in your brother's character?

14:08.066 --> 14:09.230
Be careful, Porthos.

14:09.255 --> 14:11.291
His suspicions are well placed, Majesty.

14:11.316 --> 14:13.261
To begin talks then turn in such a way.

14:13.271 --> 14:15.261
The letter bears the seal of Madrid.

14:15.286 --> 14:17.266
Could've been stolen.

14:17.442 --> 14:18.522
Forged perhaps?

14:21.242 --> 14:22.312
Treville?

14:31.182 --> 14:34.650
The Spaniards' release must
not be given royal assent.

14:34.660 --> 14:36.283
I'll issue the order myself.

14:36.308 --> 14:37.650
We'll get them from the chatelet.

14:37.660 --> 14:38.650
Quietly.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.115
We'll escort them to the rendezvous.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.210
No one will know.

14:44.388 --> 14:46.793
And if the Spanish King
is not the one behind this?

14:46.818 --> 14:50.510
We still rescue Aramis and we
bring his captors before you.

14:59.660 --> 15:01.125
If you'd come to kill me,

15:01.150 --> 15:02.759
I'm certain I'd be dead already.

15:03.283 --> 15:04.782
So, what is your business here?

15:07.570 --> 15:09.540
- Milady de Winter.
- Mmm.

15:10.302 --> 15:11.650
Minister Treville?

15:13.620 --> 15:16.680
I'm disappointed by your calm demeanour.

15:16.690 --> 15:18.640
I'd hoped for shock.

15:19.221 --> 15:20.231
Panic.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.798
Even a faint note of surprise
would have been nice.

15:24.823 --> 15:27.529
Some weeks ago dispatches from London

15:27.530 --> 15:29.640
spoke of a French murderess on the run.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.740
You married a duke.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.430
Only to kill him.

15:33.721 --> 15:35.741
The old man died of natural causes.

15:36.348 --> 15:37.408
But his son?

15:37.590 --> 15:40.103
That was not quite so natural.

15:42.610 --> 15:43.660
Bad time?

15:47.630 --> 15:49.188
I need money.

15:50.570 --> 15:52.569
The King and I were so close once,

15:52.570 --> 15:55.530
but he seems in no fit state
to provide it.

15:56.630 --> 15:58.680
The Crown will pay you a retainer.

16:01.260 --> 16:03.307
And what does it expect in return?

16:03.332 --> 16:04.392
Your skills.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.823
This is a bad time.

16:07.395 --> 16:08.435
Do you accept?

16:09.550 --> 16:11.121
I'm not an assassin.

16:11.700 --> 16:15.540
It is the only use France
will ever have for you.

16:15.550 --> 16:16.893
I still have a husband.

16:16.918 --> 16:20.540
- I can return to him. Make a life...
- Athos has a new life now.

16:22.285 --> 16:23.395
Another woman?

16:23.420 --> 16:25.300
He is a captain.

16:28.580 --> 16:30.600
And cannot be distracted.

16:32.415 --> 16:34.425
Keep away from him.

16:37.935 --> 16:39.815
You have my offer.

16:49.590 --> 16:52.664
How many of your countrymen

16:53.580 --> 16:57.600
have been murdered by these
Spaniards in cold blood?

17:00.267 --> 17:03.860
How many of you've been
made widows by their hand?

17:05.740 --> 17:10.858
Every night they sneak behind our lines

17:10.883 --> 17:13.730
and slit the throats
of our sons while they sleep.

17:13.740 --> 17:16.358
- Our brothers!
- Kill the lot of them!

17:16.383 --> 17:17.598
So much for keeping it quiet.

17:17.599 --> 17:19.579
He's brought the executions forward.

17:20.650 --> 17:24.740
- Not yet.
- Out the way! Out the way! Move!

17:25.272 --> 17:26.483
Stop!

17:26.508 --> 17:29.348
What's the meaning of this?

17:29.570 --> 17:31.620
We have orders to stay these executions

17:31.630 --> 17:33.395
and take charge of the prisoners.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.980
Take charge and let them live?

17:35.005 --> 17:37.325
They want to release
the murderous Spanish scum.

17:37.350 --> 17:38.740
What are you doing, Marcheaux?

17:40.208 --> 17:41.880
Let's see who the orders are from?

17:43.700 --> 17:46.700
No royal assent?

17:46.710 --> 17:50.063
Minister Treville needs no royal assent.

17:50.088 --> 17:51.600
Yes, he does.

17:51.610 --> 17:54.326
Then the Spanish Queen
must've leaned on him!

17:54.351 --> 17:56.510
This has nothing to do with the Queen!

17:58.640 --> 18:00.178
Farm boy?

18:00.203 --> 18:01.610
D'Artagnan?

18:01.620 --> 18:02.720
D'Artagnan!

18:05.630 --> 18:06.749
Espoir?

18:06.774 --> 18:07.774
It is you.

18:08.710 --> 18:10.629
You're a Musketeer?

18:10.630 --> 18:14.309
Please, please, D'Artagnan,
I stole one loaf of bread!

18:14.334 --> 18:15.640
- That's all!
- Not him.

18:16.364 --> 18:17.640
Cousin!

18:17.650 --> 18:19.913
- You can't let me hang!
- Don't touch me, Marcheaux.

18:19.938 --> 18:22.446
Your orders do not extend
as far as releasing this man.

18:23.243 --> 18:25.600
Am I to die because I'm not Spanish?

18:26.550 --> 18:28.116
I'm a Frenchman!

18:29.600 --> 18:32.650
They'll hang me for stealing
food, but these killers?

18:32.660 --> 18:34.530
Oh, they go free!

18:35.620 --> 18:36.640
Marcheaux!

18:39.470 --> 18:40.715
What happened?

18:40.740 --> 18:43.969
What? Doesn't Musketeer justice
extend to your own flesh and blood?

18:44.566 --> 18:46.586
D'Artagnan! D'Artagnan!

18:49.187 --> 18:51.471
That's right. Better let them through!

18:51.496 --> 18:54.862
Make way there! Let
the Spanish murderers go free!

19:01.504 --> 19:04.223
- D'Artagnan!
- Espoir!

19:04.670 --> 19:06.395
Get out of the way. Move.

19:06.420 --> 19:07.420
Move!

19:09.399 --> 19:10.923
You're coming with me.

19:20.700 --> 19:22.550
We leave at dawn.

19:27.690 --> 19:30.965
Marcheaux was quick to bring
the Queen into this.

19:30.990 --> 19:33.089
- You think he's involved?
- Don't you?

19:33.420 --> 19:34.860
Take him to my quarters.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.620
Long story.

19:43.630 --> 19:45.500
It will have to wait.

19:47.730 --> 19:50.142
If Marcheaux is in league
with Gaston and Grimaud

19:50.167 --> 19:51.655
then we need to warn the Queen.

19:51.680 --> 19:52.979
We have no evidence.

19:53.580 --> 19:55.768
He had the crowd calling
for the Queen's head.

19:57.640 --> 20:00.800
After we get Aramis back, we
need to recover the Spaniards.

20:00.825 --> 20:03.700
In the wrong hands they could
be used against Her Majesty.

20:04.122 --> 20:05.126
He's right.

20:05.150 --> 20:07.423
They're not going to just
hand them back to us.

20:07.710 --> 20:10.570
All this because the Queen wanted peace?

20:10.595 --> 20:13.555
But there will be no peace if the
people have turned against her.

20:15.920 --> 20:19.425
My dear Lorraine,
the prisoners were released.

20:19.450 --> 20:22.029
There's unrest on the streets of Paris.

20:22.030 --> 20:23.469
"Unrest?"

20:24.950 --> 20:28.865
Gentlemen, we need to bury this
Spanish Queen in shame and disgrace.

20:28.890 --> 20:30.889
Unrest and rumours?

20:30.914 --> 20:32.804
They're barely scratches.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.799
Treville gave the release
order without royal assent.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.799
The damage it caused was limited.

20:40.095 --> 20:42.065
If we're to take the throne
when Louis dies,

20:42.090 --> 20:44.700
we'll need more than
your mercenaries, Grimaud.

20:46.059 --> 20:48.019
We must make the people love us

20:48.750 --> 20:49.800
and not her.

20:49.810 --> 20:51.760
She is Spanish.

20:51.770 --> 20:53.619
Is that not enough?

20:53.620 --> 20:57.700
Has being French salvaged
your reputation, dear cousin?

21:01.780 --> 21:03.242
We will find another way.

21:03.267 --> 21:06.957
I still want these Spaniards
in my custody, Grimaud.

21:10.720 --> 21:11.996
When the time is right,

21:13.089 --> 21:16.308
perhaps we can use them as
proof of the Queen's desire

21:17.105 --> 21:20.670
to appease her brother
at France's expense.

21:21.207 --> 21:22.911
We will be the heroes.

21:24.479 --> 21:28.469
Better make sure the Musketeer doesn't
die until after the handover.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.359
Don't disappoint him, Grimaud.

21:33.384 --> 21:36.770
We'll use Aramis to draw his
friends close, then slaughter them all.

21:40.375 --> 21:43.750
Lorraine will not be pleased that
you are pursuing your own vendetta.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.640
Lorraine's prize will be unharmed.

21:49.830 --> 21:51.730
The Musketeers are mine.

22:13.339 --> 22:14.760
The fire's almost out.

22:19.441 --> 22:23.197
At least allow me
a little comfort before I die?

22:25.810 --> 22:27.680
Does Grimaud pay you enough

22:28.770 --> 22:30.111
to sit here in the cold?

22:33.406 --> 22:35.406
There's plenty of wood outside.

22:38.372 --> 22:39.432
A little warmth.

22:40.652 --> 22:41.652
Please?

23:32.575 --> 23:33.820
Well, it's a bit late now!

23:35.770 --> 23:36.780
Thank you.

23:38.820 --> 23:40.166
Hey!

23:47.726 --> 23:48.726
Don't shoot!

23:52.719 --> 23:54.559
You still need me alive.

23:54.830 --> 23:56.700
But not intact.

24:02.730 --> 24:04.720
Everything points to a concerted effort

24:04.730 --> 24:07.750
by your enemies
to tarnish your name, Majesty.

24:07.760 --> 24:10.750
Ruin your Regency's chances
before it even begins.

24:12.530 --> 24:13.610
And Marcheaux?

24:13.800 --> 24:15.710
He's part of this?

24:16.780 --> 24:18.690
It seems that way.

24:18.715 --> 24:21.695
I have tried to persuade the
King to disband the Red Guard,

24:21.840 --> 24:23.689
but he will not listen.

24:23.690 --> 24:25.630
Marcheaux's time will come.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.710
Your Majesty,

24:27.720 --> 24:30.810
Paris is full of people
who fled the Spanish.

24:30.820 --> 24:32.680
Your enemies know that.

24:33.381 --> 24:35.389
You can't have the city against you.

24:35.423 --> 24:37.820
- Not when the King is...
- You have something in mind?

24:41.566 --> 24:43.676
Show them who you really are.

24:43.701 --> 24:45.701
Show them they matter to you.

25:09.770 --> 25:11.600
Stealing?

25:12.280 --> 25:14.250
What has happened to you, Espoir?

25:15.986 --> 25:17.619
Why aren't you in Gascony?

25:18.537 --> 25:20.634
After your father left
and you didn't come back...

25:20.659 --> 25:21.649
Don't!

25:21.674 --> 25:24.803
The authorities razed the farm
to the ground.

25:25.670 --> 25:29.662
- I lost my home, my job...
- Don't you dare speak of my father to me!

25:29.687 --> 25:32.874
He would be ashamed to think of his
brother's only son as a thief!

25:32.899 --> 25:34.840
I came to Paris for work!

25:35.100 --> 25:37.150
I wanted an honest living.

25:38.348 --> 25:39.398
I just...

25:40.558 --> 25:42.518
I just didn't find one.

25:55.260 --> 25:56.620
It's all right for you.

25:58.730 --> 26:00.740
You clearly landed on your feet.

26:00.750 --> 26:02.907
Don't you dare!

26:02.932 --> 26:05.577
You have no idea
how hard I fought for this!

26:16.307 --> 26:18.417
I always knew you were good with a sword.

26:19.675 --> 26:21.585
Well, a pitchfork.

26:24.346 --> 26:25.545
Well, you were the better shot.

26:25.570 --> 26:29.450
Well, that depended on
the size of the rabbit.

26:33.830 --> 26:35.710
I thought of you often.

26:36.740 --> 26:39.830
Over the years wondered how you were?

26:39.840 --> 26:41.670
- Espoir...
- I'm just glad

26:41.680 --> 26:44.956
that we got to talk one
last time, D'Artagnan.

26:48.276 --> 26:50.770
You can return me to the Red Guard now.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.020
They'll execute him.

27:09.045 --> 27:11.498
We have a mission to rescue Aramis.

27:11.523 --> 27:12.934
And protect three Spaniards.

27:12.959 --> 27:14.082
Espoir is a Frenchman.

27:14.107 --> 27:15.710
He's still a thief.

27:15.720 --> 27:17.079
A victim of this war.

27:17.602 --> 27:19.582
Who do you want to save?

27:19.607 --> 27:21.617
Him or Aramis?

27:21.730 --> 27:23.670
All I'm asking is that he comes with us.

27:23.695 --> 27:25.680
We'll let him loose in the countryside.

27:25.690 --> 27:27.807
- We don't need distractions.
- He'll be my responsibility.

27:27.832 --> 27:30.058
Your loyalty to your cousin
is clouding your judgement.

27:30.083 --> 27:32.989
And if I let him die, my
conscience will never be clear!

27:34.700 --> 27:36.740
Surely you of all people
can understand that?

27:40.543 --> 27:42.038
I'll get the weapons.

28:00.410 --> 28:03.310
The rendezvous is half a
day's ride from Paris.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.809
- After that...
- He'll be gone. I swear it.

28:05.834 --> 28:08.410
I will not have this mission compromised.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.520
I know he's your cousin

28:13.108 --> 28:15.028
but if he gets in the way...

28:37.420 --> 28:40.596
Constance, you must have emptied
the garrison of all provisions!

28:40.621 --> 28:41.461
Here we are.

28:41.486 --> 28:43.096
- Please, everyone help them.
- Thank you.

28:44.370 --> 28:46.873
I heard you've been teaching
the poor to read and write.

28:46.898 --> 28:49.439
Word has spread
and people keep coming, but...

28:49.882 --> 28:51.685
we're running low on materials.

28:51.710 --> 28:53.330
Well, we can help with those, too.

28:53.340 --> 28:56.390
You've already done
more than enough to help us.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.697
We'll never be able to repay
your kindness.

28:59.430 --> 29:00.440
Come with me.

29:17.330 --> 29:20.380
With all this, you could spread
your message far and wide.

29:20.390 --> 29:23.823
Reach everybody in every
part of Paris. Beyond.

29:26.350 --> 29:29.330
- We cannot afford...
- The Queen can.

29:32.378 --> 29:35.792
In four years, the Crown has done
nothing to appease our suffering.

29:37.310 --> 29:41.360
The education of the poor has always been
a cause close to Her Majesty's heart.

29:42.235 --> 29:44.510
I know you don't trust her.

29:45.227 --> 29:50.892
Sylvie, you want to change things
for the better, this is how.

29:54.282 --> 29:56.300
Let the Queen help you.

30:01.861 --> 30:03.663
I'll tell Her Majesty you accept.

30:06.779 --> 30:08.639
Constance?

30:09.490 --> 30:11.360
The Captain?

30:12.129 --> 30:13.652
Athos is well.

30:14.360 --> 30:16.018
I'll say you asked after him?

30:16.043 --> 30:17.380
No.

30:35.112 --> 30:36.868
Whatever you asked of the Queen,

30:37.954 --> 30:39.350
she won't give it to you.

30:43.330 --> 30:46.136
Your friends are already on their way.

30:49.330 --> 30:51.340
Then we're both dead.

31:04.143 --> 31:06.353
The Musketeers should be
at the rendezvous now.

31:06.912 --> 31:08.436
As soon as you get word...

31:09.420 --> 31:11.370
What's going on?

31:13.626 --> 31:15.506
Rest, Louis.

31:17.975 --> 31:21.390
You both look so serious. Come.

31:24.471 --> 31:26.182
Treville was just...

31:27.088 --> 31:31.080
advising me on a charitable undertaking
I've decided to support.

31:31.661 --> 31:32.954
Mmm...

31:33.288 --> 31:34.669
A plan, Majesty,

31:35.060 --> 31:38.770
to encourage even the poorest
citizens of Paris to read and write.

31:40.673 --> 31:41.713
This again?

31:42.400 --> 31:44.662
The people need our help, Louis.

31:45.350 --> 31:48.390
What if they end up better
read than the nobility?

31:50.300 --> 31:51.778
Have you learned nothing, my dear?

31:51.803 --> 31:54.840
Her Majesty believes that helping
the poor in these difficult times

31:54.865 --> 31:56.485
will improve the Crown's reputation.

31:57.017 --> 31:58.877
Hmm... Very well.

32:02.848 --> 32:06.247
- My medicine, Treville.
- Majesty.

32:31.300 --> 32:32.470
What are you doing?

32:33.686 --> 32:35.606
Where is the Captain?

32:35.631 --> 32:36.711
Who are you?

32:38.300 --> 32:39.479
His wife.

32:40.151 --> 32:41.855
Oh, my apologies, Madame.

32:42.831 --> 32:44.017
He is not here.

32:44.042 --> 32:45.196
No matter.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.094
I am looking for a companion of his.

32:49.987 --> 32:51.067
A woman.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.330
He is my husband.

32:57.300 --> 32:58.573
Sylvie.

32:59.392 --> 33:03.452
What is the Captain's
relationship with this Sylvie?

33:04.273 --> 33:07.273
- Is she a whore?
- No, Madame.

33:07.330 --> 33:09.739
She is good. Kind.

33:10.146 --> 33:11.638
And where will I find her?

33:13.530 --> 33:16.320
I can wait until Athos returns.

33:17.350 --> 33:19.390
We do not expect him back until tomorrow.

33:24.406 --> 33:26.698
Then I hope you are a gentleman.

33:28.350 --> 33:30.410
Because I am at your mercy.

33:40.098 --> 33:43.057
The handover will take place a league
from here at first light.

33:43.082 --> 33:44.426
Lose your cousin.

33:50.321 --> 33:51.411
Come with me.

33:56.310 --> 33:57.873
It was an honour meeting you both.

33:58.966 --> 34:00.320
Espoir!

34:09.340 --> 34:10.550
Make camp.

34:11.065 --> 34:12.811
That prisoners sleep near the fire.

34:12.835 --> 34:13.876
Yes, sir.

34:22.447 --> 34:26.042
Take these, Rochelle.
Hand them out all over Paris.

34:26.067 --> 34:27.474
- This is a new beginning.
- Hmm.

34:27.949 --> 34:29.474
For everybody.

34:31.449 --> 34:34.300
I have several manuscripts to set.

34:35.480 --> 34:38.310
Fetch your master, will you?

34:38.480 --> 34:40.480
I have no master, Madame.

34:48.737 --> 34:51.678
Her Majesty always had
a weakness for noble causes.

34:51.703 --> 34:53.723
You'd call compassion a weakness?

34:57.251 --> 34:58.663
You must be Sylvie.

35:01.570 --> 35:04.657
I'm afraid I've caused trouble
between you and your comrades.

35:04.682 --> 35:06.702
They're friends and they'll get over it.

35:16.016 --> 35:18.046
- Aramis.
- What?

35:18.071 --> 35:19.396
That's his horse.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.463
Grimaud.

35:27.174 --> 35:29.385
That man down there, that's
who we've been searching for.

35:30.049 --> 35:31.565
He's preparing an attack.

35:32.393 --> 35:34.393
You'd better stick with us. Go, go!

35:48.730 --> 35:52.700
It's Grimaud. He's here, he's got Aramis.

35:52.710 --> 35:55.200
- How many men?
- I counted six.

35:55.225 --> 35:57.690
- There'll be more.
- Did you see Aramis?

35:57.700 --> 36:00.650
- No.
- This is our chance.

36:00.660 --> 36:02.372
- We need to think this through...
- We need to act.

36:02.397 --> 36:04.507
Make sure the prisoners are
secure. Can he shoot?

36:06.262 --> 36:07.511
Good.

36:09.320 --> 36:10.420
Rabbits.

36:13.453 --> 36:16.825
Window on the left.
There's too many guards.

36:18.520 --> 36:21.926
We'll draw out as many as we can.
You go on and rescue Aramis.

36:22.620 --> 36:23.916
And Grimaud?

36:24.408 --> 36:26.600
As soon as any of us gets the chance...

36:26.610 --> 36:28.510
We have a warrant for his arrest.

36:28.520 --> 36:32.550
He will not leave this place alive,
not as long as I am Captain.

36:45.249 --> 36:48.329
You've trained for this. You're ready.

36:48.354 --> 36:51.264
Whatever happens you keep
the gunpowder coming.

36:58.178 --> 36:59.591
Positions.

37:34.502 --> 37:35.542
The horses!

37:37.901 --> 37:39.213
Quick!

37:40.753 --> 37:42.730
In here! Ten men!

37:42.740 --> 37:45.520
Take him down.

37:59.042 --> 38:01.942
Ten men, ten muskets! 16 pistols!

38:04.550 --> 38:06.570
You're a dead man, Grimaud!

38:41.710 --> 38:44.077
They're surrounding us, stop them!

38:45.163 --> 38:47.639
You've awoken something in Athos!

38:48.570 --> 38:49.796
Go!

38:51.570 --> 38:54.640
You think you can use me
to protect yourself?

38:54.650 --> 39:00.520
My friends know I will lay down
my life to stop you, so go ahead.

39:49.540 --> 39:51.590
Move in! Move in!

40:12.523 --> 40:13.583
Stop!

40:16.610 --> 40:19.719
- Lower your weapon!
- No, Porthos!

40:19.720 --> 40:23.610
- Lower it. I am leaving.
- Kill us both.

40:24.401 --> 40:27.729
- Do it! Shoot now!
- Shut up!

40:38.854 --> 40:39.994
Grimaud!

40:49.620 --> 40:53.550
You should've all fired! Killed us both!

40:54.670 --> 40:56.620
You shouldn't keep secrets!

40:56.730 --> 40:58.630
I wanted peace!

40:59.690 --> 41:03.610
We've all seen what war does to the world!

41:03.620 --> 41:05.540
It makes refugees!

41:05.550 --> 41:09.540
Men like Grimaud, places like Eparcy.

41:11.700 --> 41:15.520
There can be no peace as long
as Grimaud lives.

41:20.448 --> 41:24.520
No, not for you, my friend.

41:30.630 --> 41:32.660
So you saved the Captain's life.

41:39.677 --> 41:43.737
Take him he's yours.
Just look after him, please.

41:47.180 --> 41:49.666
No vacancies, I suppose?

41:50.570 --> 41:52.580
I reckon I'd make a good Musketeer.

41:54.492 --> 41:56.432
Mmm... No.

41:59.165 --> 42:00.345
Come here.

42:04.740 --> 42:06.670
Stay out of trouble.

42:15.620 --> 42:18.540
I'm still the better shot.

42:20.560 --> 42:22.610
It's been good to see you.

42:43.600 --> 42:46.887
Are we returning to Paris
or are we going after Grimaud?

42:47.650 --> 42:49.600
Grimaud's gone.

42:51.650 --> 42:53.510
I'm tired.

42:54.690 --> 42:56.670
Let's go back to Paris.

43:04.072 --> 43:06.197
You don't have the Spanish prisoners.

43:06.463 --> 43:08.181
How will we ruin the Queen?

43:08.689 --> 43:10.969
Lorraine will not be pleased
with your failure.

43:10.994 --> 43:13.600
We have not failed yet.

43:16.455 --> 43:19.555
There's something you should see, er...

43:19.690 --> 43:24.303
The Queen has sponsored
the woman from the settlement

43:24.328 --> 43:27.348
to print and distribute these.

43:29.273 --> 43:33.695
She's helping the poor to learn and
they are making the Queen very popular,

43:33.720 --> 43:35.610
very quickly.

43:37.640 --> 43:40.670
It's perfect. It bears the Queen's seal.

43:42.133 --> 43:44.489
This is how we ruin her.

43:47.229 --> 43:50.948
Take them straight back to the
chatelet and buy some wine.

43:51.570 --> 43:52.940
For all of you?

43:53.526 --> 43:54.862
For them.

43:59.700 --> 44:02.580
Captain? I'm sorry.

44:14.375 --> 44:16.281
You did come to the crossroads.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.690
I thought you'd abandoned me.

44:41.913 --> 44:43.437
This cannot be happening.

44:44.531 --> 44:46.234
And yet it is.

45:01.680 --> 45:03.680
- I can't.
- Why?

45:03.690 --> 45:05.753
You need to go.

45:06.337 --> 45:09.307
- You don't want that.
- You don't know what I want.

45:13.442 --> 45:14.482
Sylvie.

45:16.266 --> 45:17.891
What have you done to her?

45:19.251 --> 45:21.155
What do you care if she's alive or dead?

45:21.180 --> 45:22.329
What have you done?

45:24.376 --> 45:25.956
This is who you are, Athos.

45:28.610 --> 45:31.236
- It's who you've always been.
- If you've hurt her...

45:31.261 --> 45:33.670
What? You'll kill me?

45:42.570 --> 45:45.640
Stay. She's safe.

45:50.680 --> 45:52.670
You'll never believe me, will you?

45:57.610 --> 45:58.660
Sylvie!

46:00.630 --> 46:03.017
- Sylvie?
- The Red Guard took her.

46:03.560 --> 46:04.308
Why?

46:04.333 --> 46:06.660
They say she's responsible for this.

46:11.283 --> 46:12.534
They're everywhere.

46:17.466 --> 46:21.436
Show everyone. Come look, come look.

46:23.195 --> 46:26.604
Your Majesty! Bless you.

46:27.690 --> 46:29.630
Your Majesty.

46:31.396 --> 46:34.508
- The Spanish Queen's latest lover!
- Your Majesty.

46:36.157 --> 46:38.157
- Look, look!
- It's a disgrace.

46:40.186 --> 46:41.246
Burn in...

46:43.506 --> 46:44.685
Get off me!

46:44.756 --> 46:46.899
She's not our queen!

46:47.510 --> 46:49.499
What's happening?

46:53.645 --> 46:55.400
There's the Queen.

46:55.425 --> 46:57.096
Duck!

46:57.572 --> 46:59.689
The Queen is trying to help you!

47:01.955 --> 47:03.032
Stay back!

47:03.057 --> 47:04.330
Where did this filth come from?

47:04.355 --> 47:06.630
They're everywhere. Get the
Queen back to the palace.

47:07.700 --> 47:09.870
This way, Your Majesty.

47:19.690 --> 47:23.600
It seems we've been holding peace talks
with the Spanish that I know nothing about.

47:23.633 --> 47:25.741
And now... Now these!

47:25.911 --> 47:27.802
The Spanish Queen's latest lover!

47:28.255 --> 47:30.630
The servants have been finding
them all over the palace!

47:30.640 --> 47:32.064
How many more are out on the streets?

47:32.089 --> 47:33.836
It is difficult to say, Majesty.

47:33.861 --> 47:35.275
How many?

47:35.300 --> 47:37.600
There may be hundreds, Sire.

47:37.610 --> 47:41.530
Who suggested that the Queen give this
Sylvie woman money in the first place?

47:41.540 --> 47:44.639
Well that was intended to show the
people that the Crown cares, Sire.

47:44.640 --> 47:45.889
It was ill conceived.

47:45.914 --> 47:48.102
Majesty, there is a design at work here.

47:48.126 --> 47:49.975
Your enemies mean to discredit the Queen.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.530
But Sylvie Bodaire is not part of it.

47:52.540 --> 47:53.455
Really?

47:53.572 --> 47:55.572
Well, I'm told she has
preached rebellion in the past.

47:57.267 --> 47:58.962
Your Majesty, if I may?

47:59.470 --> 48:02.116
Sylvie has proved herself
to be a woman of honour.

48:02.660 --> 48:06.560
Show me the honour in this,
Porthos. Show it to me.

48:11.580 --> 48:14.520
Now, the Red Guard
have their instructions.

48:15.720 --> 48:18.560
Be grateful I have not had her executed.

48:21.670 --> 48:23.600
You are not dismissed, Captain.

48:23.610 --> 48:26.610
- You are not dismissed!
- After him.

48:36.385 --> 48:38.387
The King commands

48:39.520 --> 48:43.067
this unholy woman to be punished.

48:45.100 --> 48:47.108
She is charged with publishing

48:47.311 --> 48:51.295
malice and debauchery against the Queen.

48:51.670 --> 48:54.740
His Majesty and God's Grace

48:56.510 --> 48:58.921
sentence her to 20 lashes!

48:58.946 --> 49:03.640
There is no God in this travesty and no
grace in any part of what you do today.

49:06.127 --> 49:08.244
30 lashes!

49:12.530 --> 49:14.620
Madame D'Artagnan helped you.

49:16.456 --> 49:20.506
Name her and we will keep
the strokes light.

49:23.060 --> 49:25.130
Whatever you do to me today,

49:26.550 --> 49:28.284
I will still be innocent.

49:29.111 --> 49:33.097
But you, after this
there'll be no going back.

49:34.650 --> 49:36.580
This will hurt.

49:59.700 --> 50:01.580
Stop him!

50:08.570 --> 50:12.536
To defy the law of the King is treason!

50:12.561 --> 50:13.950
To hell with the law!

50:25.378 --> 50:26.448
Put it down.

50:27.092 --> 50:28.779
Put it down!

50:29.177 --> 50:30.769
I'm not done so I need it.

50:30.794 --> 50:31.945
Animals!

50:31.970 --> 50:33.950
Put it down.

50:35.453 --> 50:37.219
You should hang your heads in shame!

50:59.168 --> 51:00.566
I have you.

51:01.737 --> 51:03.066
I have you.

51:08.620 --> 51:10.590
You accept my offer?

51:12.292 --> 51:14.272
I accept what I am.

51:17.550 --> 51:19.520
I'll kill for you.

51:20.564 --> 51:22.424
Not for me.

51:24.590 --> 51:25.690
For the Crown.

51:26.690 --> 51:29.560
Spoken like a true politician.

51:29.570 --> 51:31.540
Seems we've both found our place.

51:39.116 --> 51:41.166
I'll send word when you're needed.

52:13.710 --> 52:15.670
It's my fault, Athos.

52:20.590 --> 52:22.660
It was Grimaud, not you.

52:22.670 --> 52:24.510
Athos?

52:31.620 --> 52:33.500
I'm here.

52:35.570 --> 52:37.570
I'll always be here.

52:39.156 --> 52:40.977
Where does it end?

52:42.550 --> 52:44.670
When they come for the ones you love?

53:07.670 --> 53:09.460
How will my reputation recover?

53:09.485 --> 53:10.720
You are protected, Majesty.

53:10.730 --> 53:12.725
You cannot fight an idea, Aramis.

53:13.350 --> 53:15.452
- I have to speak to the King.
- No.

53:15.939 --> 53:18.908
Allow me to speak to him.
I will take this upon myself.

53:18.933 --> 53:20.520
We both know where that will lead!

53:20.530 --> 53:23.560
- Then, we'll give him time.
- He has no time.

53:23.570 --> 53:28.670
I have to try and put this right before
it takes hold, grows into something more.

53:35.630 --> 53:37.580
Your Majesty.

53:37.590 --> 53:39.670
You love the people so much, my dear.

53:39.680 --> 53:40.700
Louis.

53:42.249 --> 53:44.757
This is what the people think of you.

53:46.350 --> 53:48.287
Spanish harlot!

54:01.863 --> 54:03.783
Do you realise what you have done?

54:03.808 --> 54:06.690
- My intentions...
- Your intentions are irrelevant!

54:06.700 --> 54:10.284
A soldier should never
play at politics, Aramis.

54:10.309 --> 54:12.259
Isn't that what you're doing?

54:15.231 --> 54:16.685
Get out!

54:17.020 --> 54:18.687
- Listen...
- Out!

54:34.022 --> 54:39.022
