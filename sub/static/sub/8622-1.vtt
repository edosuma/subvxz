00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

01:22.663 --> 01:24.848
Hey, make up your mind.
Do you want to bet or don't you?

01:24.998 --> 01:26.517
Shut up.
You want the cops to hear you, you mug?

01:26.667 --> 01:28.806
Go on, you four-flusher.

01:48.055 --> 01:49.973
ls this as close to the place
as you can take us?

01:50.123 --> 01:51.675
Yeah, and this is too close for me.

01:51.825 --> 01:53.510
lt wouldn't look very good
in the newspapers, Charlie,

01:53.660 --> 01:56.504
if l was caught breaking the state laws.

01:56.730 --> 01:57.848
Which way do we go?

01:57.998 --> 02:00.684
Right down that street, sir.
Just follow the crowd. You can't miss it.

02:00.834 --> 02:02.336
Come on.

02:19.519 --> 02:22.039
-Come on here, boy.
-Show them what you got.

02:22.189 --> 02:23.895
There he is.

02:24.257 --> 02:25.809
-Show 'em what you got.
-Come on, Mauler.

02:25.959 --> 02:29.804
Hey, Mauler. Are you coming out,
or you gonna change your mind?

02:37.838 --> 02:39.022
The admission is $2, mister.

02:39.172 --> 02:40.824
What do you mean $2?
lt's supposed to be $1.

02:40.974 --> 02:43.527
l haven't got time to argue.
This is a big fight. Get out of line.

02:43.677 --> 02:46.129
Well, how do you like these guys?
What do they think this is, the opera?

02:46.279 --> 02:47.698
What are we gonna do?
Come on, let's go home.

02:47.848 --> 02:49.933
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
How much money have you got?

02:50.083 --> 02:52.970
-l have $1.30, l guess.
-All right, give me your $1.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.305
-What're you gonna do, Jim?
-Wait right here.

02:55.455 --> 02:58.299
-Here you are. Where's Callahan?
-lnside.

02:58.925 --> 02:59.910
-Hey, Callahan.
-Yeah.

03:00.060 --> 03:01.945
l wanna tip you off to something.
You see that guy over there?

03:02.095 --> 03:03.814
-The tall fellow with no hat?
-Yeah.

03:03.964 --> 03:06.016
Well, he's just had his pockets picked,
and he's boiling.

03:06.166 --> 03:07.117
He says he's gonna get the cops.

03:07.267 --> 03:09.086
You better do something about it
if you don't wanna be raided.

03:09.236 --> 03:11.113
-Thanks.
-Quick.

03:17.677 --> 03:18.762
Come on, get in there.

03:18.912 --> 03:20.197
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
l didn't do anything.

03:20.347 --> 03:22.759
Cut it out, cut it out.

03:23.650 --> 03:25.459
Get out of there.

03:26.219 --> 03:29.063
-What happened?
-You're in, aren't you? Come on.

03:31.825 --> 03:33.810
Hey, Walter. Look up on the hill there.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.445
-Do you know who that is?
-No. Who?

03:35.595 --> 03:37.281
That's Judge Geary.
He's one of the directors of the bank.

03:37.431 --> 03:39.650
Yeah? Let's go and stand there.
Maybe we'll get a chance to meet him.

03:39.800 --> 03:40.917
Come on.

03:41.067 --> 03:44.309
Come on, get this thing started,
looks like rain.

03:51.445 --> 03:54.865
Now, Hoghead, l'm warning you.
You won't get one cent for this fight

03:55.015 --> 03:57.901
if you choke him, bite him
or stick your thumb in his eye.

03:58.051 --> 04:00.395
-You understand?
-Oh, yeah?

04:02.756 --> 04:03.707
And you.

04:03.857 --> 04:07.429
lf you get your finger in his mouth,
it's your own fault.

04:09.629 --> 04:11.370
Are you ready?

04:11.631 --> 04:14.651
Come on. Come on, now.

04:14.801 --> 04:16.386
Are you ready?

04:16.536 --> 04:17.969
That a boy.

04:25.178 --> 04:27.715
Now, fight like gentlemen.

04:45.732 --> 04:47.017
l think l like Hoghead.

04:47.167 --> 04:50.478
l don't know.
That Mauler looks awful big to me.

05:59.039 --> 06:01.958
lt's an outrage. That's what it is,
a scandalous outrage.

06:02.108 --> 06:04.194
l don't know
what San Francisco's coming to.

06:04.344 --> 06:07.063
A decent, sport-minded man
can't even go to a dog fight

06:07.213 --> 06:10.734
without being humiliated
by these crazy state laws.

06:10.884 --> 06:12.803
Then why don't you
change the laws, Judge?

06:12.953 --> 06:16.173
Because you big, muscle-bound tramps
from the Barbary Coast

06:16.323 --> 06:18.341
have killed the fight game.

06:18.491 --> 06:20.377
But mark my words, all of you,

06:20.527 --> 06:22.212
there'll be some changes
made in this town.

06:22.362 --> 06:24.347
How do you mean, Judge?

06:24.497 --> 06:26.349
The Olympic Club, young fellow.

06:26.499 --> 06:30.287
lt stands for good, clean sport,
and if we can't go to see fights,

06:30.437 --> 06:32.756
then by Godfrey
we'll put them on ourselves.

06:32.906 --> 06:34.724
Do you mean with
paid fighters, professionals?

06:34.874 --> 06:35.826
No.

06:35.976 --> 06:38.228
We brought a great instructor
from England, Harry Watson,

06:38.378 --> 06:39.996
who taught the Prince of Wales.

06:40.146 --> 06:42.999
We'll take in a few clean-cut boys
from good families,

06:43.149 --> 06:46.169
and if we can't make you fighters
into gentlemen,

06:46.319 --> 06:49.857
we'll try to make
some gentlemen into fighters.

06:52.792 --> 06:54.778
Hey, listen.

06:54.928 --> 06:58.048
Do you know what the Mauler told me
about you coming over in the wagon?

06:58.198 --> 07:00.150
He said you were a big yellow bag of wind,

07:00.300 --> 07:02.285
he could lick you anytime,
any place, anywhere.

07:02.435 --> 07:05.939
-Oh, he did, huh?
-Yeah, but don't tell him l told you.

07:09.075 --> 07:10.794
Stand back, fellas.
Give him some room now.

07:10.944 --> 07:14.498
Let's have plenty of room. That's it.
All right, boys.

07:14.648 --> 07:17.322
Come on now, get in there and fight.

07:18.118 --> 07:19.035
Hey, hey, Jim.

07:19.185 --> 07:22.689
lf the bank hears about this,
we'll lose our jobs, sure.

07:38.571 --> 07:40.423
Hey. Hey, Jim.

07:40.573 --> 07:43.178
-Did you see what l just saw?
-Yeah.

07:43.943 --> 07:45.629
-Judge Geary, wasn't it?
-Yeah.

07:45.779 --> 07:48.098
Gee, we're gonna get fired sure, l know it.

07:48.248 --> 07:50.166
Looks like it.

07:50.316 --> 07:52.135
Walter, there's only one thing to be done.

07:52.285 --> 07:53.637
We gotta beat him to the punch.

07:53.787 --> 07:55.805
We gotta send in our resignations.

07:55.955 --> 07:58.108
All right, Jim, but...
Gee, do you think we ought to do it?

07:58.258 --> 08:00.602
Sure. l've made up my mind.

08:01.361 --> 08:02.812
To the President, Comstock Bank.

08:02.962 --> 08:04.014
Dear Mr. Mclnnes...

08:04.164 --> 08:07.250
So old Judge Kinsey,
the toughest man on the California bench,

08:07.400 --> 08:10.453
took one look at me in that mob
and nearly dropped his gavel.

08:10.603 --> 08:12.956
"By gad, sir! " he barks.

08:13.106 --> 08:17.042
"You, a supreme court justice,
caught at a prize fight."

08:18.378 --> 08:21.331
Well, l can already see
the newspaper headlines.

08:21.481 --> 08:24.067
l stood there like a chicken-thief
with a hen in each pocket.

08:24.217 --> 08:25.902
l couldn't even open my mouth,

08:26.052 --> 08:28.371
when all at once this young fellow...
What's his name?

08:28.521 --> 08:30.373
-Corbett. James Corbett.
-Yeah.

08:30.523 --> 08:32.842
Well, Corbett steps up and says,

08:32.991 --> 08:37.313
"Your Honor,
there's been a very serious mistake.

08:37.464 --> 08:41.775
"Judge Geary, here, is the director
of the bank in which l'm employed."

08:42.034 --> 08:45.188
Now Corbett says, "We were
all three down on Pacific Street

08:45.338 --> 08:47.857
"looking at a piece of property
the bank is interested in.

08:48.007 --> 08:51.194
"We happened to see this crowd,
and so we walked over to investigate.

08:51.344 --> 08:55.799
"Naturally, we had no idea
that there was a prize fight going on.

08:55.949 --> 09:00.003
"Why, people in our position would never
dream of being seen in such company."

09:00.153 --> 09:01.538
Says Corbett.

09:01.688 --> 09:05.942
-So old Judge Kinsey let you go, eh?
-Scot-free.

09:06.092 --> 09:10.632
Apologized all over the place
and gave everybody else 30 days.

09:14.501 --> 09:16.620
You sent for me, Mr. Mclnnes?
But l want to give you this...

09:16.770 --> 09:19.389
Yes, Corbett. l understand
you already know Judge Geary.

09:19.539 --> 09:20.523
Yes, sir. We've met.

09:20.673 --> 09:22.859
You did the bank a great service
last night, young man.

09:23.009 --> 09:23.960
That was quick thinking.

09:24.110 --> 09:26.630
We like a man who can make good,
fast decisions on his feet.

09:26.780 --> 09:30.033
Well, l don't know about the bank,
but you certainly saved my skin.

09:30.183 --> 09:32.702
How long have you been with us, Corbett?
Three years?

09:32.852 --> 09:33.970
Four, sir.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.506
Well, it's about time
we raised your salary, anyhow.

09:36.656 --> 09:40.763
Starting next week, it'll be $12.50 a week.

09:42.896 --> 09:46.783
-Well, what happened, Jim? Are we fired?
-Fired? l should say not.

09:46.933 --> 09:50.175
He wouldn't accept my resignation.
He tore it up.

09:50.403 --> 09:53.338
-l got a raise.
-A raise?

09:53.606 --> 09:55.025
$2.50 a week.

09:55.175 --> 09:57.027
-Are you kidding?
-Kidding?

09:57.177 --> 09:59.329
Well, what about me? l was there, too.

09:59.479 --> 10:02.198
But you didn't talk up.
Always remember that, Walter, my boy.

10:02.348 --> 10:05.669
That's the guy they pay off on,
the guy who talks up.

10:05.819 --> 10:09.232
Why don't you go in there
and assert yourself? Go on.

10:12.559 --> 10:15.733
Oh, l... l gotta go to lunch.

10:31.477 --> 10:35.186
lf you'd like to come over here,
Miss Ware...

10:37.383 --> 10:40.193
-Good morning, Miss Ware.
-Good morning.

10:40.620 --> 10:43.273
-How would you like this, large bills?
-No. All in silver, please.

10:43.423 --> 10:46.242
Well, it's gonna make
a pretty big stack of cartwheels.

10:46.392 --> 10:48.244
Do you think you can carry them
all by yourself?

10:48.394 --> 10:49.746
l should have brought a handbag.

10:49.896 --> 10:52.182
Father's in a big poker game over
at the Olympic Club,

10:52.332 --> 10:53.950
and they won't play
with anything else but silver.

10:54.100 --> 10:57.775
-Oh, l see. Did you say the Olympic Club?
-Yes.

10:58.271 --> 11:00.056
Well, it happens to be just my lunchtime.

11:00.206 --> 11:02.625
l'll be very happy to carry this over
for you, if you like.

11:02.775 --> 11:05.161
Oh, l think l could take it
if l had something to carry it in.

11:05.311 --> 11:07.188
But thank you, anyway,

11:07.647 --> 11:10.333
-Mr. Corbett.
-Oh, no trouble at all, Miss Ware.

11:10.483 --> 11:12.769
l'll have my assistant, Mr. Lowrie,
put it in a bag for you.

11:12.919 --> 11:15.923
-You don't mind, do you, Walter?
-No, no.

11:16.222 --> 11:17.941
l'll be just one minute.

11:18.091 --> 11:19.409
-Hello, Miss Ware.
-Hello.

11:19.559 --> 11:24.565
-Gee, it sure is a beautiful day, isn't it?
-Yes, it certainly is.

11:25.131 --> 11:29.705
Yes, it's really beautiful outside.

11:30.536 --> 11:31.521
Thank you, Walter.

11:31.671 --> 11:34.124
You can have those bonds ready for me
to sign when l come back.

11:34.274 --> 11:37.594
And, oh, yes, when Senator Gage
gets here, have him wait for me, will you?

11:37.744 --> 11:39.678
l'll return shortly.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.549
Put it in the barouche there.

11:50.556 --> 11:52.342
You and Buck Ware's daughter?
What's the big...

11:52.492 --> 11:55.302
Pipe down, Pop. This is a break for me.

11:55.728 --> 11:56.946
Thank you, Mr. Corbett.

11:57.096 --> 11:59.749
-This has been very kind of you.
-Think nothing of it, Miss Ware.

11:59.899 --> 12:02.152
The first rule of our bank
is to satisfy the customer.

12:02.302 --> 12:04.521
-You told him where l'm going?
-No, but l will.

12:04.671 --> 12:08.881
-Cabby, the Olympic Club.
-The Olympic Club.

12:21.321 --> 12:23.173
-Dennis, will you take this bag, please?
-Surely.

12:23.323 --> 12:24.908
That's all right, Miss Ware. l'll carry it in.

12:25.058 --> 12:26.576
No bother at all. lt's part of my duty.

12:26.726 --> 12:28.378
Sure, Dennis, but you've got a lot to do.

12:28.528 --> 12:29.479
Suppose you got held up?

12:29.629 --> 12:31.881
Well, frankly,
l'm not quite sure l haven't been.

12:32.031 --> 12:35.706
Oh, will you excuse me
while l take care of the fare?

12:36.035 --> 12:38.354
Say, Pop, lend me $1, will you? l'm broke.

12:38.504 --> 12:41.858
-Oh, sure.
-Thanks.

12:42.008 --> 12:43.393
Keep the change.

12:43.543 --> 12:46.763
Of all the nerve,
borrowing money from you.

12:46.913 --> 12:49.791
Well, why shouldn't he? He's me own son.

12:52.051 --> 12:54.838
Say, you could put half of San Francisco
in this club.

12:54.988 --> 12:58.424
-Oh, this is just the foyer, Mr. Corbett.
-Yeah?

13:00.593 --> 13:02.178
One of the members
who passed away, huh?

13:02.328 --> 13:04.747
Oh, no. That's a very famous statue
by Douglas Tilden.

13:04.897 --> 13:06.983
-The Fallen Boxer.
-Tilden?

13:07.133 --> 13:11.604
-What was he, a middleweight?
-l think Mr. Tilden was the sculptor.

13:11.771 --> 13:13.089
-Boy.
-Yes, Miss Ware?

13:13.239 --> 13:15.191
You may take this bag to my father
in the card room.

13:15.341 --> 13:17.393
No, don't worry, Miss Ware.
l'll take care of this, son.

13:17.543 --> 13:20.530
l want to deliver it in person.
Which way do l go?

13:20.680 --> 13:22.632
The card room's at the far end of the hall.

13:22.782 --> 13:24.334
All right. Don't go away now.

13:24.484 --> 13:27.192
lf l get lost, l'll send up a rocket.

13:27.353 --> 13:29.492
lt wouldn't surprise me.

13:30.223 --> 13:33.676
A fine bunch of wolves.
Won't even take a man's bank check.

13:33.826 --> 13:37.180
No, but we'll take his bank
if we get the chance.

13:37.330 --> 13:39.282
How do we know your check is any good?

13:39.432 --> 13:42.085
One day you're flush,
next day you're broke.

13:42.235 --> 13:44.387
Say, any time you boys think
you're smart enough

13:44.537 --> 13:47.506
to break me, l'll quit the mining business.

13:48.374 --> 13:50.627
Here you are, Mr. Ware.
Sure hope we brought enough.

13:50.777 --> 13:52.528
lt was a little too heavy
for your daughter to carry.

13:52.678 --> 13:54.497
Oh. Thank you, darling.

13:54.647 --> 13:56.466
-You're from the bank, young man?
-Yes, sir.

13:56.616 --> 13:58.301
-Thanks for coming over.
-Oh, not at all.

13:58.451 --> 14:02.592
Yeah. Maybe he better stick around.
You're likely to need him again.

14:02.989 --> 14:04.040
My name's Corbett, sir.

14:04.190 --> 14:05.275
-How many?
-Three, please.

14:05.425 --> 14:07.677
-l beg your pardon?
-l said my name's Corbett, sir.

14:07.827 --> 14:09.846
l only know these gentlemen
by reputation, but...

14:09.996 --> 14:12.237
Well, you are very lucky.

14:13.199 --> 14:15.385
Have a good day, Mr. Corbett.
Much obliged for your service.

14:15.535 --> 14:17.353
-l'll open for 20.
-Raise you 10.

14:17.503 --> 14:19.789
Two pair is no good
in this game of cutthroats.

14:19.939 --> 14:21.991
-l'm in.
-l will come in and raise.

14:22.141 --> 14:24.360
Now, don't be frightened,
l have plenty of money now.

14:24.510 --> 14:27.597
Sorry to keep you waiting, Miss Ware,
l had to be introduced to the gentlemen.

14:27.747 --> 14:29.565
Swell bunch of fellows. Swell.

14:29.715 --> 14:31.534
Hello, darling. My, you look beautiful.

14:31.684 --> 14:33.870
Thank you, dear.
l wish l could return the compliment.

14:34.020 --> 14:36.739
-How's the hangover?
-Heavens, does it still show?

14:36.889 --> 14:40.576
Oh, excuse me, Carlton,
this is Mr. Corbett, Mr. Dewitt.

14:40.726 --> 14:42.278
-How do you do?
-How are you?

14:42.428 --> 14:45.081
Mr. Corbett very kindly came back
with me from the bank,

14:45.231 --> 14:46.482
and now l'm showing him the Club.

14:46.632 --> 14:48.217
l'd like to show you around myself,
if l may.

14:48.367 --> 14:50.620
Oh, no, thanks. Don't bother.
Miss Ware is doing fine.

14:50.770 --> 14:53.957
Well, l must be getting back to the office.
See you tonight, Vicki.

14:54.107 --> 14:55.925
lt's been a pleasure meeting you,
Mr. Carbon.

14:56.075 --> 14:57.727
Thanks. Corbett's the name.

14:57.877 --> 14:59.529
-Oh, l beg your pardon.
-Oh, that's all right.

14:59.679 --> 15:01.431
-Well, goodbye, anyway.
-Goodbye.

15:01.581 --> 15:03.499
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, darling.

15:03.649 --> 15:06.769
Swell guy. You engaged to him?

15:06.919 --> 15:09.105
Well, practically. How did you guess?

15:09.255 --> 15:10.373
l heard you call him "darling."

15:10.523 --> 15:12.976
People don't throw those darlings
around unless they mean something.

15:13.126 --> 15:14.811
You're very observant, Mr. Corbett.

15:14.961 --> 15:17.480
And now l'll show you the dining room
and the terrace,

15:17.630 --> 15:19.716
and you can say
you've seen the Olympic Club.

15:19.866 --> 15:22.938
-Fine. Oh, did you say the dining room?
-Yes.

15:24.770 --> 15:26.489
Gee whiz.

15:26.639 --> 15:31.494
You know, Miss Ware, l'd give 10 years
of my life to belong to a club like this.

15:31.644 --> 15:33.363
-Why?
-Oh, l don't know.

15:33.513 --> 15:35.865
lt's just one of those hunches a guy has,
you know?

15:36.015 --> 15:38.067
You've got to have something,
that's all there is to it.

15:38.217 --> 15:40.303
l wish l wanted something
as much as that.

15:40.453 --> 15:42.105
-What do you want?
-Nothing.

15:42.255 --> 15:44.273
-Nothing?
-Not a thing.

15:44.423 --> 15:47.577
But, well, how about that guy
you're engaged to?

15:47.727 --> 15:50.046
The good-looking fellow?
Don't you want him?

15:50.196 --> 15:52.448
Yes, l suppose l do.

15:52.598 --> 15:54.917
But there's never been anything
l had to have.

15:55.067 --> 15:59.106
l've never sat on the edge of a chair
like you're sitting now.

16:00.740 --> 16:03.126
Well, l suppose that comes
from having had everything.

16:03.276 --> 16:05.061
No, l don't think that's it.

16:05.211 --> 16:07.397
You see, l was born
in Virginia City, Nevada,

16:07.547 --> 16:09.932
-and played on a slag heap until l was 10.
-You did?

16:10.082 --> 16:13.803
My father was a silver miner,
a grubstaker on the Comstock Lode.

16:13.953 --> 16:17.273
-A grubstaker? You don't say.
-l can see he was like you once.

16:17.423 --> 16:20.563
He wanted something else,
and he had to have it.

16:20.726 --> 16:23.179
l suppose the Comstock
and the racehorses

16:23.329 --> 16:26.315
took all the desire he had in him
and there was none left over for me.

16:26.465 --> 16:29.434
Oh, l wouldn't say that, Miss Ware.

16:30.102 --> 16:34.346
Good heavens,
how did we get to talking so seriously?

16:34.974 --> 16:37.693
-Mr. Corbett, do you know what time it is?
-No, 1.00?

16:37.843 --> 16:40.163
-lt's 1.45.
-No fooling? ls it?

16:40.313 --> 16:43.733
l heard you tell your assistant
you expected Senator Gage.

16:43.883 --> 16:46.235
-Thanks. Who?
-Senator Gage.

16:46.385 --> 16:48.738
Senator... Senator...

16:48.888 --> 16:51.107
-Oh, you mean Senator Gage?
-Yes.

16:51.257 --> 16:52.875
Oh, he can wait.

16:53.025 --> 16:56.145
l guess we better hurry anyway, though.
l haven't seen the gymnasium yet.

16:56.295 --> 16:58.881
Can't go through the Olympic Club
without having seen the gymnasium.

16:59.031 --> 17:01.918
Lady members aren't allowed in there.
lt's strictly a man's world.

17:02.068 --> 17:04.787
Oh, don't worry about that. l'll handle that.

17:04.936 --> 17:07.178
May l have the check, please?

17:15.982 --> 17:17.567
Let me take care of that, Miss Ware.

17:17.717 --> 17:21.337
-Oh, no, Mr. Corbett, you're my guest.
-Well, thanks.

17:21.487 --> 17:23.728
l'll take care of the tip.

17:23.990 --> 17:27.443
-Say, got change for 20?
-l'm sorry, sir, l don't.

17:27.593 --> 17:29.045
No?
Well, l'll take care of you some other time.

17:29.195 --> 17:30.379
My name's Corbett.

17:30.529 --> 17:31.514
Thank you, sir.

17:31.664 --> 17:32.982
-Ready, Miss Ware?
-Yes.

17:33.132 --> 17:35.237
Good.

17:48.180 --> 17:49.765
That's Judge Geary.

17:49.915 --> 17:52.602
Now, remember
to protect yourself at all times.

17:52.752 --> 17:55.071
l'll feint, follow with a left to the stomach.

17:55.221 --> 17:57.840
-You try and block it.
-All right. Go ahead.

17:57.990 --> 18:00.026
Afternoon, Judge.

18:00.493 --> 18:02.845
l'm sorry, Judge, but, well,
you were off-balance anyway.

18:02.995 --> 18:04.814
Wide open for that left.

18:04.964 --> 18:06.449
Good afternoon, Victoria.

18:06.599 --> 18:08.718
-How do you do, Miss Ware?
-Good afternoon.

18:08.868 --> 18:10.000
l hope you'll forgive
my bursting in like this,

18:10.000 --> 18:11.087
You're Watching 123Movies.to
l hope you'll forgive
my bursting in like this,

18:11.087 --> 18:11.237
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:11.237 --> 18:14.223
but l was more or less shanghaied.
Mr. Corbett's a very persuasive person.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:14.223 --> 18:14.373
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:14.373 --> 18:17.026
Oh, yes, indeed. l can testify to that.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:17.026 --> 18:17.176
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:17.176 --> 18:19.795
Watson, this is the chap
l was telling you about.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:19.795 --> 18:19.945
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:19.945 --> 18:22.000
Saved my judicial skin last night.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:22.000 --> 18:22.031
Saved my judicial skin last night.

18:22.181 --> 18:24.133
Oh, l'm pleased to meet you.
Pardon the glove.

18:24.283 --> 18:26.469
Very proud to meet you, too, Mr. Watson.

18:26.619 --> 18:27.770
Heard a lot about you, sir.

18:27.920 --> 18:29.805
This is the man who taught
the Prince of Wales how to box.

18:29.955 --> 18:31.340
Really? How interesting.

18:31.490 --> 18:34.777
l do a little boxing myself.
Of course, just backyard stuff.

18:34.927 --> 18:37.113
Could certainly learn a lot
from an expert like you though, sir.

18:37.263 --> 18:39.182
Oh, it's all a matter of practice.

18:39.332 --> 18:40.883
You got a good build for a boxer.

18:41.033 --> 18:44.320
Say, l'd sure like to put those gloves on
with you for a minute.

18:44.470 --> 18:46.088
Well, then, why don't you, Corbett?

18:46.238 --> 18:48.624
-Let Watson show you that left jab of his.
-Great.

18:48.774 --> 18:51.060
l'd like to see it.
Always willing to learn, sir.

18:51.210 --> 18:53.129
-Oh, it's a beauty.
-l'll bet it is.

18:53.279 --> 18:54.397
Hold this, will you, Miss Ware?

18:54.547 --> 18:57.099
Really, Mr. Corbett,
l have an engagement and l'm late.

18:57.249 --> 18:59.402
-This will just take a moment.
-What about the bank? You said...

18:59.552 --> 19:01.504
They can get along without me
until l get back there.

19:01.654 --> 19:03.940
Thank you, Judge. Lace that, will you?

19:04.090 --> 19:05.641
My father's certainly
gonna be proud to hear

19:05.791 --> 19:07.777
l've had the gloves on with you,
Mr. Watson.

19:07.927 --> 19:09.679
Come on now, Miss Ware. No fancy knots.

19:09.829 --> 19:12.605
You've got a beau already, remember?

19:14.033 --> 19:16.104
Hold this, will you?

19:16.302 --> 19:18.721
Now, young man,
l want you to put your left up like this.

19:18.871 --> 19:19.956
And l'm gonna hit you with my left.

19:20.106 --> 19:21.090
l want to see what you're gonna do.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.982
-Catch on?
-All right, sir. l think so.

19:24.610 --> 19:25.595
Very good.

19:25.745 --> 19:28.497
Now, l'm gonna use
what we call a one-two.

19:28.647 --> 19:29.732
And l want you to counter.

19:29.882 --> 19:32.317
-Now, watch it.
-All right, sir.

19:33.586 --> 19:35.137
Oh, l'm sorry. l didn't mean to jab you.

19:35.287 --> 19:37.640
Sorry? With a left like that?

19:37.790 --> 19:41.110
Well, young man, l see you can
take care of yourself. Come on.

19:41.260 --> 19:43.479
l won't hit you very hard.

19:43.629 --> 19:45.881
ln fact, l don't think
l'm gonna hit you at all.

19:46.031 --> 19:48.017
Nice, straightforward chap, isn't he?

19:48.167 --> 19:49.719
Well, l wouldn't call him backward, Judge.

19:49.869 --> 19:50.853
You know, Victoria,

19:51.003 --> 19:53.089
that's very much the type
of young man we've been looking for.

19:53.239 --> 19:55.358
-What for?
-For our athletic memberships.

19:55.508 --> 19:57.560
They're free.
Do you think he'd be interested?

19:57.710 --> 20:02.591
They're free? Yes. l'm sure he would be.

20:03.849 --> 20:05.935
Well, l've already sponsored three of them.

20:06.085 --> 20:08.404
Two baseball players
and a hammer thrower.

20:08.554 --> 20:09.872
Look here, Victoria.

20:10.022 --> 20:13.442
lf l could get your father
to put up Mr. Corbett's name,

20:13.592 --> 20:16.145
would you be willing to sponsor him?

20:16.295 --> 20:19.081
Judge Geary, this is the most amazing
thing l've ever heard of.

20:19.231 --> 20:23.019
Two hours ago, Mr. Corbett
was just a bank clerk in here on an errand.

20:23.169 --> 20:25.454
And now... Well, look at him.

20:25.604 --> 20:28.983
-He seems perfectly at home, doesn't he?
-At home?

20:29.175 --> 20:30.826
ln six months, he'll own the Club.

20:30.976 --> 20:33.251
Then you will put him up?

20:35.147 --> 20:37.957
l don't know how else to get rid of him.

20:56.669 --> 20:59.522
Anyhow, Father Burke, you know
you had us worried there for a while.

20:59.672 --> 21:00.990
You haven't been to our house
for a long time.

21:01.140 --> 21:02.625
l've been kind of busy.

21:02.775 --> 21:06.762
But there isn't a home in the parish
l'd sooner be invited to than the Corbett's.

21:06.912 --> 21:09.365
l never know to be sure what to expect.

21:09.515 --> 21:12.835
-But it's always a pleasant surprise.
-Thank you, Father.

21:12.985 --> 21:14.737
And it's always a pleasure
to have you here.

21:14.887 --> 21:16.539
But talking about surprises,

21:16.689 --> 21:19.141
where do you think
our Jim had lunch today?

21:19.291 --> 21:20.609
Where, Ma?

21:20.759 --> 21:23.145
At the Olympic Club, if you please.

21:23.295 --> 21:26.082
-The Olympic Club.
-Did he tell you that, Ma?

21:26.232 --> 21:29.251
Why, your Ma's telling the gospel truth.
l drove him there, meself.

21:29.401 --> 21:32.822
l waited two hours for him and when
he came out he had a quill toothpick.

21:32.972 --> 21:35.291
Well, after that, maybe
the young gentleman won't approve

21:35.441 --> 21:37.326
of having a couple of longshoremen
in the family.

21:37.476 --> 21:40.514
Oh, not at all, Harry, l enjoy the contrast.

21:40.779 --> 21:42.631
He enjoys the contrast.

21:42.781 --> 21:44.934
Now, ain't that some language
and coming from him

21:45.084 --> 21:46.902
that used to spell bird with a "U."

21:47.052 --> 21:49.605
-Who spelled bird with...
-That's the hotsie-tootsie.

21:49.755 --> 21:52.508
Well, so long as you folks
appreciate me so much,

21:52.658 --> 21:55.444
l'm now gonna give you
a real piece of news.

21:55.594 --> 21:56.946
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:57.096 --> 21:59.849
you're looking at the new athletic member
of the Olympic Club,

21:59.999 --> 22:01.283
sponsored by none other than

22:01.433 --> 22:04.286
Mr. Henry Ware and his daughter,
Victoria, of the same name.

22:04.436 --> 22:06.389
-Well, glory be...
-You're kidding, Jim.

22:06.539 --> 22:08.124
l'm not, Pop. l've got the card here.

22:08.274 --> 22:10.226
l had it all fixed up today. Look.

22:10.376 --> 22:12.595
-Look at that.
-Congratulations, Jim.

22:12.745 --> 22:16.332
lt's a fine club, and it's quite an honor
for a south-side boy to be a member.

22:16.482 --> 22:17.533
That it is.

22:17.683 --> 22:20.269
You know, ever since Jim was that high,
he's been trying to improve himself,

22:20.419 --> 22:21.804
one way or another.

22:21.954 --> 22:24.640
And if you two lads
had followed his example,

22:24.790 --> 22:27.343
you wouldn't be pushing
a truck up a gangplank all day long.

22:27.493 --> 22:29.245
Well, Pop's at it again.

22:29.395 --> 22:31.747
George, maybe you and me better
go out in the barn

22:31.897 --> 22:34.717
-and eat with the horses, eh?
-lt's them high collars, Harry.

22:34.867 --> 22:37.486
Them elegant, high collars.

22:37.636 --> 22:40.742
Them lovely, high collars.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.391
Cut it out, will you, fellas?

22:42.541 --> 22:44.093
You'll have to excuse them,
Father, they're...

22:44.243 --> 22:45.261
That's all right, Jim.

22:45.411 --> 22:48.597
We forgot you was the only gentleman
in the family.

22:48.747 --> 22:51.267
Well, the least you two fellas
can do is to behave like gentlemen.

22:51.417 --> 22:52.902
Particularly when Father Burke's here.

22:53.052 --> 22:58.195
-Well, it's them elegant collars.
-And that lovely tie.

22:59.858 --> 23:04.180
Now, Harry, you know what happens
when you fool around with my tie.

23:04.330 --> 23:07.416
lf it weren't for the fact that l'm
a gentleman and Father Burke is here,

23:07.566 --> 23:10.419
l'd take you outside
and teach you a lesson in manners.

23:10.569 --> 23:12.571
Oh, l get you.

23:19.445 --> 23:21.618
Well, what's holding you?

23:24.583 --> 23:27.291
Come on, come on.

23:27.586 --> 23:29.905
Excuse us, Father Burke.
l'll be back in a minute.

23:30.055 --> 23:32.041
Well, which one of you
are gonna be first this time?

23:32.191 --> 23:33.709
You can take me.

23:33.859 --> 23:35.911
-What is this?
-Another one of them things.

23:36.061 --> 23:38.314
-Are you coming, Father?
-Oh, sure, sure.

23:38.464 --> 23:41.484
You sit right down in that chair.
A fight is no place for a lady.

23:41.634 --> 23:44.444
But, Ma, l missed the last one.

23:59.251 --> 24:01.253
The Corbetts are at it again!

24:07.359 --> 24:08.911
-Good morning, good morning.
-Good morning.

24:09.061 --> 24:10.179
Any mail for me?

24:10.329 --> 24:11.914
-What's the name, please?
-Corbett. James J. Corbett.

24:12.064 --> 24:13.449
-l'm a new member.
-No, sir. No, sir.

24:13.599 --> 24:16.051
No? Nothing?

24:16.201 --> 24:18.354
Say, you don't happen to have a cigar,
do you?

24:18.504 --> 24:21.439
-Yes, l have.
-Oh, thanks very much.

24:21.874 --> 24:23.292
Listen, l'm gonna tip you off to something.

24:23.442 --> 24:24.393
What's that?

24:24.543 --> 24:25.928
-You see that statue over there?
-Yeah.

24:26.078 --> 24:27.263
Well, that doesn't belong down here.

24:27.413 --> 24:28.597
Why don't you have it
moved up in the gym?

24:28.747 --> 24:31.625
-Very well, we'll have it moved.
-Good.

24:33.085 --> 24:34.403
There's nothing like a good smoke.

24:34.553 --> 24:38.262
-How many cigars do you smoke a day?
-Oh, any given number.

24:39.858 --> 24:41.477
-See you later.
-Paging Mr. Crocker...

24:41.627 --> 24:43.913
Hey, kid. Listen, l'm a new member.

24:44.063 --> 24:45.614
James J. Corbett. l'll be in the card room.

24:45.764 --> 24:47.903
-Have me paged there, will you?
-All right, sir.

24:48.333 --> 24:52.440
Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett.

24:52.638 --> 24:54.290
Paging Mr. Corbett.

24:54.440 --> 24:57.860
What did l tell you? There he goes,
having himself paged again.

24:58.010 --> 24:59.962
Well, boys, we might as well face it.

25:00.112 --> 25:03.766
Something's got to be done about Corbett
before he drives us all crazy

25:03.916 --> 25:05.167
or somebody kills him.

25:05.317 --> 25:07.369
He doesn't really mean to be such
a pain in the neck, Jerry.

25:07.519 --> 25:09.204
lt's just a natural gift with him,
like boxing.

25:09.354 --> 25:11.941
Why do we have to put up with a bore
just to have a boxer?

25:12.091 --> 25:14.176
Confound it, this is a social club.

25:14.326 --> 25:16.245
Let him take his biceps somewhere else.

25:16.395 --> 25:17.680
Corbett's a type.

25:17.830 --> 25:20.382
And you can't take offense at a type,
it's no use.

25:20.532 --> 25:23.085
The offensiveness isn't really individual.

25:23.235 --> 25:26.522
Has he ever pushed you off
the flying rings, just playful like?

25:26.672 --> 25:29.158
Or tickle you when
you're on the parallel bars,

25:29.308 --> 25:31.686
just to see what would happen?

25:32.444 --> 25:36.415
lf there was only some way we could pin
his ears back and put him in his place.

25:38.784 --> 25:43.238
Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett.

25:43.388 --> 25:44.740
Paging Mr. Corbett.

25:44.890 --> 25:46.609
Rest.

25:46.759 --> 25:49.178
Hands on chest. Place.

25:49.328 --> 25:54.516
Forward. Back. Forward. Back.
Forward. Rest.

25:54.666 --> 25:56.702
Hands on hips.

25:57.102 --> 25:59.088
Half bend slowly.

25:59.238 --> 26:05.018
Down, up, down, up, down. Rest.

26:05.344 --> 26:09.164
And this exercise, gentlemen,
is for reducing the waistline.

26:09.314 --> 26:11.400
Hands over the head.

26:11.550 --> 26:13.702
Slowly bending, touching the floor.

26:13.852 --> 26:15.456
Down.

26:17.589 --> 26:19.441
Lower, gentlemen, lower.

26:19.591 --> 26:23.095
Touch the floor, Mr. Huntington.
Touch the floor.

26:25.631 --> 26:27.667
Slowly rising.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.969
Up. Up.

26:31.737 --> 26:34.615
That will be all, gentlemen. Relax.

26:39.278 --> 26:41.296
Hello, Jack.

26:41.446 --> 26:43.732
Well, l'm glad to see they got you fixed up.

26:43.882 --> 26:46.101
Gentlemen, l want you to meet
an old friend of mine,

26:46.251 --> 26:47.803
the one and only Jack Burke.

26:47.953 --> 26:50.272
Former heavyweight champion
of the British lsles and Australia.

26:50.422 --> 26:52.374
-How do you do, Mr. Burke?
-How do you do?

26:52.524 --> 26:53.909
He just got off the boat this morning

26:54.059 --> 26:55.678
so l asked him to drop in
and work out the kinks.

26:55.828 --> 26:57.446
Well, l'm glad you did, Watson.

26:57.596 --> 27:00.182
-How long you staying in town, Mr. Burke?
-Oh, l don't know, sir.

27:00.332 --> 27:01.817
Ten days, perhaps a fortnight.

27:01.967 --> 27:05.020
l'm fighting Jake Kilrain in Chicago
on the 25th.

27:05.170 --> 27:08.057
Would you be willing to put on
a little contest for us?

27:08.207 --> 27:11.360
-We'd see you were very well paid for it.
-But l have to be in Chicago.

27:11.510 --> 27:13.495
You'd be doing the Club
a great personal favor, Mr. Burke.

27:13.645 --> 27:17.933
Yes, indeed. Now why don't you
stay over and we'll pay you, say, $1,000?

27:18.083 --> 27:21.937
-$1,000? How much is that? 200 guineas?
-That's right.

27:22.087 --> 27:23.472
Would that satisfy you?

27:23.622 --> 27:26.975
Not only satisfies me, gents,
but l'll satisfy you as well.

27:27.125 --> 27:29.344
l get it, you wanna give somebody
a good drubbing, is that it?

27:29.494 --> 27:31.980
As you say, Mr. Burke. That is it.

27:32.130 --> 27:36.018
Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett.

27:36.168 --> 27:40.708
Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett.

27:45.911 --> 27:46.862
Look at you.

27:47.012 --> 27:49.531
Well, l can't believe me eyes.

27:49.681 --> 27:51.700
How do you like it? How does it fit?
How do l look, huh?

27:51.850 --> 27:53.902
Just like you were melted
and poured into it.

27:54.052 --> 27:56.105
Anyone that says it ain't yours is a liar.

27:56.255 --> 27:59.808
-Look at this, Pa. Five bucks extra.
-$5.

27:59.958 --> 28:02.311
-You gonna fight in those clothes?
-No, Mary.

28:02.461 --> 28:05.447
Well, George, what about it?

28:05.597 --> 28:08.150
You look just like one
of Pop's $500 funerals.

28:08.300 --> 28:12.488
That's a fine thing to say, and him off
to fight the ex-champion of England.

28:12.638 --> 28:14.389
Well, why don't you say something, Pop!

28:14.539 --> 28:18.026
Jim, me boy,
you've set the Corbetts ahead 1,000 years.

28:18.176 --> 28:19.495
l'll go get the barouche. She's all polished.

28:19.645 --> 28:20.929
-All right.
-Oh, Jim,

28:21.079 --> 28:23.766
you're the handsomest man
of south San Francisco.

28:23.916 --> 28:25.367
-Oh, now, Mary.
-l'm afraid Ma was right.

28:25.517 --> 28:27.035
We have got one gentleman in family.

28:27.185 --> 28:29.171
Yeah, but don't be too much of a one.
l got 20 bucks bet on you.

28:29.321 --> 28:30.839
-Don't worry, boys. So long, Harry.
-Good luck, Jim.

28:30.989 --> 28:32.608
-So long, George.
-We'll be waiting up for you.

28:32.758 --> 28:33.842
Goodbye, kid. Goodbye, Ma.

28:33.992 --> 28:35.811
Jim, don't let him hurt you.

28:35.961 --> 28:38.280
Don't worry, Ma.
He won't even lay a glove on me.

28:38.430 --> 28:41.150
-Oh, say, Ma. Look, how about this flower?
-Beautiful.

28:41.300 --> 28:42.951
-Yeah, but is it big enough?
-Sure.

28:43.101 --> 28:44.286
Okay, goodbye.

28:44.436 --> 28:46.905
Careful of that suit, you know it's rented!

29:23.041 --> 29:25.127
Hey, Walter, hang on to this, will you?
lt belongs to Harry.

29:25.277 --> 29:26.495
-Hello, Mr. Dewitt.
-Hiya, Corbett.

29:26.645 --> 29:28.430
Miss Ware, Mr. Ware.
How are you, Judge?

29:28.580 --> 29:30.199
-Good luck.
-Hello, Mr. Huntington.

29:30.349 --> 29:33.335
-Good luck, Jim. Remember that left.
-All right, Father.

29:33.485 --> 29:35.037
Well, here l go.

29:35.187 --> 29:39.499
Take the show away from him, darling.
Tell him you'll fight the winner.

29:41.693 --> 29:45.595
Hello, Jim ! There he is. That's him.
That's my boy.

29:47.299 --> 29:48.550
Ladies and gentlemen,

29:48.700 --> 29:51.553
we now have the pleasure
of witnessing a 10-round,

29:51.703 --> 29:53.944
or perhaps shorter,

29:54.339 --> 29:56.925
exhibition of the scientific art
of self-defense

29:57.075 --> 30:00.920
between Mr. Jack Burke,
former heavyweight champion of England

30:03.949 --> 30:07.851
and Mr. James J. Corbett
of the Olympic Club.

30:11.123 --> 30:13.364
Hello, Jim. There he is.

30:13.859 --> 30:16.945
lt may be of interest for you to know
that for the first time in America

30:17.095 --> 30:20.015
this contest will governed by
the new Marquess of Queensberry rules.

30:20.165 --> 30:23.619
The rounds will be of three minutes
duration, with one minute's rest.

30:23.769 --> 30:25.888
A round will not end by a knockdown.

30:26.038 --> 30:28.790
The man on the floor will have
10 seconds to regain his feet

30:28.940 --> 30:31.493
or be counted out by the referee.

30:31.643 --> 30:34.521
The referee, Mr. Harry Watson.

30:42.654 --> 30:45.073
Now, gentlemen, you know the rules
as we discussed them. Obey them.

30:45.223 --> 30:49.330
l want you to shake hands,
go to your corner and come out fighting.

30:52.230 --> 30:53.800
Time!

32:28.426 --> 32:30.064
Time!

32:38.837 --> 32:40.922
That bloke jumps around
like a jack rabbit, Birdsey.

32:41.072 --> 32:42.691
But l'll get him this round.

32:42.841 --> 32:47.396
Mommy, why doesn't Daddy look
like that in his underwear?

32:47.546 --> 32:50.254
He did once.

32:50.916 --> 32:52.554
Time.

34:00.852 --> 34:05.874
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

34:06.024 --> 34:10.165
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

34:22.340 --> 34:25.994
-Well, what do you think of my protégé?
-Well, l put him up, didn't l?

34:26.143 --> 34:27.362
-l got him in.
-Sure.

34:27.512 --> 34:31.585
Then you put up $1,000
to get him knocked out.

34:33.418 --> 34:37.353
l'll take yours.
This is the easiest money l ever got!

34:49.601 --> 34:52.554
You know, Miss Ware,
here's something l can't understand.

34:52.704 --> 34:53.822
What is it, Mr. Corbett?

34:53.972 --> 34:57.592
Well, how can l be dancing with you?
l'm supposed to be murdered.

34:57.742 --> 35:00.862
-Feeling pretty good, aren't you?
-Oh, listen, l'm feeling fine.

35:01.012 --> 35:04.166
l'm well aware of it.
You have a beautiful start.

35:04.316 --> 35:06.868
Well, l figure if l can lick
a former world's champion that easy,

35:07.018 --> 35:08.570
l'd ought to be able to take almost anyone.

35:08.720 --> 35:12.340
Oh, Mr. Corbett, what a beautiful
swelled head you're going to have.

35:12.490 --> 35:15.596
You'll be bouncing around like a balloon.

35:18.396 --> 35:19.881
Miss Ware, you're wrong about that.

35:20.031 --> 35:22.784
You see, a swelled head is a guy
who thinks he's good and isn't.

35:22.934 --> 35:24.586
-Get the difference?
-Oh, l see.

35:24.736 --> 35:26.755
Besides, didn't you say just now
l had a good start?

35:26.905 --> 35:29.858
l did. But l wasn't referring
to your ring career, Mr. Corbett.

35:30.008 --> 35:32.961
l was talking about the champagne.
lf you're not used to it, it's tricky.

35:33.111 --> 35:36.631
Champagne? Tricky? Listen.
l come from a long line of drinkers.

35:36.781 --> 35:40.592
l can probably drink
more than anybody in the world.

35:40.919 --> 35:43.672
-Miss Ware, that's for being so right.
-Thank you.

35:43.822 --> 35:45.373
-Hello.
-Hello. How do you do?

35:45.523 --> 35:47.730
Well. Thank you.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.513
Pardon me. That was my drink you took.

35:51.663 --> 35:55.099
lt was? Well, then, this one must be mine.

36:00.171 --> 36:02.123
-Have a drink, huh?
-l've got one, thanks.

36:02.273 --> 36:04.125
And l'd like to introduce myself.
l'm Jim's...

36:04.275 --> 36:05.961
l know you.
You're Corbett's friend, aren't you?

36:06.111 --> 36:08.897
Friend?
l've known Jim ever since we were kids.

36:09.047 --> 36:10.465
We went to school together
and everything.

36:10.615 --> 36:12.667
And let me tell you there isn't a guy
in Hayes Valley

36:12.817 --> 36:15.770
that Jim can't lick
except maybe Joe Choynski.

36:15.920 --> 36:17.906
-Oh, really?
-Did l ever tell you about the fight he had

36:18.056 --> 36:20.775
with Joe on a barge down
behind Ming's Wharf?

36:20.925 --> 36:23.111
-Excuse me.
-Yeah, it's okay.

36:23.261 --> 36:25.447
l'm gonna have a dance, anyway.
l haven't been on the floor yet.

36:25.597 --> 36:27.372
l'll see you later.

36:31.136 --> 36:34.189
You know, l've never really thanked you
for making all of this possible.

36:34.339 --> 36:37.359
lf you hadn't brought me here
and sort of sponsored me for membership,

36:37.509 --> 36:40.462
well, l guess l never would have seen
this side of the tracks at all.

36:40.612 --> 36:43.465
But, you know, there really aren't
two sides of the tracks to San Francisco.

36:43.615 --> 36:45.600
There's only the lucky and the unlucky.

36:45.750 --> 36:48.870
Those that happened to grab
the right moment and those that didn't.

36:49.020 --> 36:52.540
And don't you let this Nob Hill crowd
deceive you, either.

36:52.690 --> 36:55.677
After all, we all started out
with the same wooden washtubs.

36:55.827 --> 36:59.729
l'd been hoping all night
you'd let your hair down with me.

37:02.434 --> 37:06.187
-Why, you impertinent roughneck.
-Who? Me?

37:06.337 --> 37:09.958
That was carrying your well-known nerve
just a little bit too far, Mr. Corbett.

37:10.000 --> 37:10.108
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:10.108 --> 37:12.794
Yeah, but what's the matter?
l thought you wanted me to kiss you.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:12.794 --> 37:12.944
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:12.944 --> 37:14.229
l never said anything of the kind.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:14.229 --> 37:14.379
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:14.379 --> 37:17.399
Well, l know you didn't say so, but
you brought me out here in the moonlight.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:17.399 --> 37:17.549
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:17.549 --> 37:20.101
And you told me not to be scared.
What do you think l was gonna do?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:20.101 --> 37:20.251
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:20.251 --> 37:22.000
-Why, you...
-Oh, you'll have to do better than that.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:22.000 --> 37:22.704
-Why, you...
-Oh, you'll have to do better than that.

37:22.854 --> 37:25.926
l hope some man knocks your block off.

37:51.816 --> 37:53.727
Hey.

38:04.429 --> 38:07.248
Hey, Judge. You remember me, don't you?

38:07.398 --> 38:09.884
Walter Lowrie? You know,
the night we got pinched at the fight

38:10.034 --> 38:12.320
and taken down to the jail?

38:12.470 --> 38:16.825
That's the funniest thing l ever saw.
Him in there with all the rest of us.

38:16.975 --> 38:20.320
-Wilbur, what is he referring to?
-Why, l...

38:21.246 --> 38:23.920
Oh, my dear, there's a mistake.

38:24.249 --> 38:26.568
-Young man, you're intoxicated.
-Who? Me? No, sir.

38:26.718 --> 38:30.859
You remember we sat right next
to each other in the patrol wagon?

38:31.122 --> 38:34.042
Wilbur, explain yourself.

38:34.192 --> 38:37.230
Hey, Judge, did l say something wrong?

38:38.897 --> 38:40.865
l guess l did.

38:42.567 --> 38:45.053
Look here, Dewitt. That friend of Corbett's

38:45.203 --> 38:46.588
is getting completely out of hand.

38:46.738 --> 38:48.089
l know. He's tight as an owl.

38:48.239 --> 38:51.960
He buttonholed me three times
to describe the fight blow by blow,

38:52.110 --> 38:53.561
as if l hadn't been there.

38:53.711 --> 38:55.697
Well, now, you're the chairman
of the floor committee.

38:55.847 --> 38:57.165
l think you should ask him to leave.

38:57.315 --> 38:59.901
Well, all right. But l hope
he doesn't try and make a scene.

39:00.051 --> 39:02.270
He can't do much more than he did
to Judge Geary.

39:02.420 --> 39:04.472
Come on. Drink up.
This is good stuff, isn't it?

39:04.622 --> 39:06.274
-On the house, too.
-Sure.

39:06.424 --> 39:07.409
Can l speak to you a minute?

39:07.559 --> 39:08.676
Hello, Dewitt. How are you?

39:08.826 --> 39:10.545
Say, that was a pretty good speech
you made tonight.

39:10.695 --> 39:13.381
-You remember the part...
-Yeah, "10 rounds or perhaps shorter."

39:13.531 --> 39:15.183
-Will you have a drink?
-No, thanks. No.

39:15.333 --> 39:18.109
-Come on. lt's on the house.
-lt's on the house.

39:18.336 --> 39:20.755
Listen, Corbett,
this is very embarrassing to me.

39:20.905 --> 39:24.580
But l'm afraid we'll have to ask
your friend here to leave.

39:25.376 --> 39:28.563
-Who, me?
-lf you don't mind. l'm terribly sorry.

39:28.713 --> 39:30.665
Why has he got to leave?
What's the matter with him?

39:30.815 --> 39:33.034
Well, among other things,
he isn't in formal attire,

39:33.184 --> 39:34.335
which was obligatory tonight.

39:34.485 --> 39:38.592
Some of our ex-gold miners
are very particular about form.

39:39.023 --> 39:41.309
Oh, they are, are they?

39:41.459 --> 39:46.169
-Well, he looks all right to me.
-Well, this a very nice suit. lt's...

39:46.431 --> 39:50.084
-Well, it's dark, anyway.
-Please. Let's not have a scene.

39:50.234 --> 39:53.188
A scene? l already put on one scene
for you tonight, didn't l?

39:53.338 --> 39:55.523
Can't l ask a friend in here?
He's not doing any harm.

39:55.673 --> 39:56.858
Oh, no. lt's all right, Jim. l'll go.

39:57.008 --> 39:58.493
Yeah. All right. Wait a minute, Walter.

39:58.643 --> 40:01.095
Well, will you answer my question,
Dewitt? Can l or can't l?

40:01.245 --> 40:03.198
l'm sorry, Corbett,
but this is a strict rule of the Club.

40:03.348 --> 40:05.967
-He must leave.
-All right.

40:06.117 --> 40:08.470
-lf he goes, l go, too.
-That's entirely up to you.

40:08.620 --> 40:11.339
-l had hoped you might understand.
-Understand?

40:11.489 --> 40:15.210
Sure, l understand perfectly. You mean,
it's all right for me to stay here, huh?

40:15.360 --> 40:17.045
'Cause l'm like a sort of trained seal?

40:17.195 --> 40:19.414
But now l've done my act,
my friend isn't a part of the deal.

40:19.564 --> 40:21.498
-ls that it? Yeah, yeah.
-Not that at all.

40:22.133 --> 40:24.853
l hear some of you gentlemen
already lost $1,000

40:25.003 --> 40:26.855
trying to put me in my place tonight.

40:27.005 --> 40:28.790
l'm sorry to disappoint you,

40:28.940 --> 40:33.628
but l sure thought you'd be better sports
than to try and get back at me this way.

40:33.778 --> 40:35.814
Come on, Walter. Let's get out of here.

40:51.562 --> 40:54.531
Let's get our coats and hats first.

40:57.502 --> 41:01.990
Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett.

41:02.140 --> 41:04.552
Paging Mr. Corbett.

41:07.545 --> 41:10.150
Can l make up this room now?

41:29.867 --> 41:32.186
-Hey, Walter.
-What?

41:32.336 --> 41:34.372
Where are we?

41:38.443 --> 41:41.796
l don't know. This ain't my room.
lt must be yours.

41:41.946 --> 41:44.187
No. lt's not mine.

41:44.682 --> 41:47.390
-lt looks like a hotel.
-Hotel?

41:47.752 --> 41:51.654
-What would we be doing in a hotel?
-Oh, l don't know.

41:52.824 --> 41:55.009
Do you know what? l think we passed out.

41:55.159 --> 41:58.470
-Yeah.
-What's the last thing you remember?

41:59.197 --> 42:00.733
Well.

42:01.432 --> 42:05.219
We got kicked out of the Olympic Club.
You remember that?

42:05.369 --> 42:09.772
-Yeah.
-Then, we went to one,

42:11.075 --> 42:15.330
two, three bars. That's all l remember.

42:15.480 --> 42:17.949
Yes, yes, yes.

42:19.150 --> 42:22.170
Jim, we got to get going.
We got to get to the bank.

42:22.320 --> 42:24.872
Yeah. Come on.
Come on. Hand me my shoes, will you?

42:25.022 --> 42:26.558
Yeah.

42:26.858 --> 42:28.576
-You got it?
-Yeah. No, that's not it.

42:28.726 --> 42:30.797
-Here.
-Thanks.

42:31.362 --> 42:33.171
-Hey.
-What?

42:34.398 --> 42:37.251
-What were we doing on a train?
-Train?

42:37.401 --> 42:39.972
-You must have been dreaming.
-l guess so.

42:42.607 --> 42:45.076
l wonder what part of town we're in.

42:45.543 --> 42:46.976
Hey...

42:48.012 --> 42:50.014
Jim, come here.

42:50.348 --> 42:54.193
lf this is San Francisco,
it's a part of town l never saw before.

42:54.986 --> 42:56.522
-Look.
-What?

42:56.888 --> 42:59.741
That big sign. Salt Lake lce Company.

42:59.891 --> 43:01.476
Salt Lake City.

43:01.626 --> 43:05.246
Well, it can't be.
That's way back east somewhere.

43:05.396 --> 43:07.273
Salt Lake City.

43:08.266 --> 43:11.819
-That's where the Mormons come from.
-How did we ever get here?

43:11.969 --> 43:14.789
-l don't know.
-How much money you got?

43:14.939 --> 43:16.748
l'm broke.

43:18.376 --> 43:20.685
Thirty-five cents.

43:20.845 --> 43:24.098
Gee. What's the bank gonna do for tellers?

43:24.248 --> 43:27.217
What're the tellers gonna do for a bank?

43:28.853 --> 43:30.638
Hiya, Corbett.

43:30.788 --> 43:32.073
Well, here's your 10 bucks.

43:32.223 --> 43:34.676
Everything is all set,
and Miller is raring to go.

43:34.826 --> 43:35.910
-My 10 bucks?
-Sure,

43:36.060 --> 43:37.311
you said you'd fight him for 10 bucks.

43:37.461 --> 43:39.380
ln fact, last night,
you said you'd fight him for five.

43:39.530 --> 43:42.417
But Miller's a little tough,
so l've decided to give you 10.

43:42.567 --> 43:44.819
Miller? Who's Miller?

43:44.969 --> 43:48.439
-Who's Miller?
-He's a big, local pug.

43:48.606 --> 43:51.109
He'd make two of you. Say,

43:52.043 --> 43:54.996
-you are a fighter, ain't you?
-Sure. Sure, l am, but...

43:55.146 --> 43:56.852
But what?

43:57.114 --> 44:00.735
Oh, l see. Not enough dough, huh?
All right, l'll get somebody else.

44:00.885 --> 44:02.637
Not smart, that's me.

44:02.787 --> 44:04.372
l pick drunks out of a saloon.

44:04.522 --> 44:07.041
He tells me he just knocked out
the champion of England.

44:07.191 --> 44:09.043
Why, l ought to know better.
Give me my...

44:09.193 --> 44:12.113
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Let's get this thing straight.

44:12.263 --> 44:15.450
Oh, l'm a little dizzy, you know,
it seems that last night l was...

44:15.600 --> 44:16.751
A little, you know...

44:16.901 --> 44:18.953
Yeah. You were a little more than
"you know" last night.

44:19.103 --> 44:21.708
You were soused. What a bun!

44:23.507 --> 44:27.895
Well, we... Yeah, we had a little wine.
But where do l fight and when?

44:28.045 --> 44:30.765
Well, now that sounds a little better.
Now, here's the setup.

44:30.915 --> 44:33.534
lt's a six-fight card.
All boys here from Salt Lake City.

44:33.684 --> 44:35.369
All good boys, l know them all.

44:35.519 --> 44:38.372
-Well, in a private club or what?
-What do you mean, a private club?

44:38.522 --> 44:41.409
l'm Billy Delaney.
None of that small stuff for me.

44:41.559 --> 44:45.166
l'm strictly big time.
No amateur smokers for me.

44:45.696 --> 44:47.482
l'll see you later tonight, boys.

44:47.632 --> 44:50.585
Delaney's Bar over on Tucker road.
And be there early, will you?

44:50.735 --> 44:51.886
-Sure.
-So long, champ.

44:52.036 --> 44:53.708
So long.

44:55.673 --> 44:59.883
-Do you wanna fight, too?
-No, l just wanna get my job back.

45:03.347 --> 45:05.433
Oh, the door.

45:05.583 --> 45:08.336
Jim, you can't fight.
You're not in any condition to fight.

45:08.486 --> 45:12.991
-You must feel as bad as l do.
-l feel just as bad as you do.

45:13.624 --> 45:16.511
But l've got to fight.
l took the guy's money.

45:16.661 --> 45:18.446
-We've gotta get home.
-Yeah.

45:18.596 --> 45:21.215
Anyway, l can probably lick the guy.

45:21.365 --> 45:25.176
-Yeah, but you're not a professional.
-Professional?

45:26.771 --> 45:29.012
Professional.

45:29.507 --> 45:31.816
Some of those boys do all right.

45:33.077 --> 45:38.199
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

45:38.349 --> 45:40.301
-6...
-l don't blame you, gents.

45:40.451 --> 45:44.456
l ought to beg your pardon
for even bringing in such a ham-and-egger.

45:49.894 --> 45:54.849
1, 2, 3, 4,

45:54.999 --> 45:58.970
5, 6, 7,

45:59.337 --> 46:03.148
8, 9, 10.

46:05.343 --> 46:07.895
Jim, you won. You won, you hear me?
You won.

46:08.045 --> 46:10.965
Great, kid, great. What a comeback.
What you need is a good manager,

46:11.115 --> 46:12.033
a smart guy to bring you along.

46:12.183 --> 46:15.721
l ain't seen nobody hit like that
but John L. Sullivan.

46:44.615 --> 46:47.425
l can lick any man in the world.

46:47.651 --> 46:49.937
Mike, drinks for everybody in the house.

46:50.087 --> 46:53.908
Tonight the Palace Bar is taken over
by John L. Sullivan himself.

46:54.058 --> 46:55.910
And l want to shake the hand
of every one of you.

46:56.060 --> 46:57.612
-Glad to meet you, champ.
-l'm glad to meet you, sir.

46:57.762 --> 47:00.348
-l saw you fight Kilrain.
-Kilrain's a great fighter, a great man.

47:00.498 --> 47:02.950
Come on now, boys.
Come on, the drinks are all on me.

47:03.100 --> 47:04.185
Get up there.

47:04.335 --> 47:07.121
Well, l'd be in lreland a long time
before ever this'd happen to me.

47:07.271 --> 47:08.289
What's that, sir?

47:08.439 --> 47:12.126
Meeting and shaking hands
with John L. Sullivan himself.

47:12.276 --> 47:13.995
-Oh, well, that's fine, sir. That's fine.
-You know,

47:14.145 --> 47:15.463
l have a boy who's a fighter, too.

47:15.613 --> 47:16.898
Oh, well, l'd like to meet him sometime,
sir.

47:17.048 --> 47:18.833
Come on now, boys. Come on, come on.

47:18.983 --> 47:21.793
l can lick any man in the world.

47:26.223 --> 47:29.710
"Choynski," he says.
"Who's Choynski?" l asked.

47:29.860 --> 47:32.246
"My kid brother Jim can beat him."
You know what he said?

47:32.396 --> 47:33.381
What?

47:33.531 --> 47:35.983
Said you were a lucky kid.
Never met anybody but third-raters.

47:36.133 --> 47:38.252
"Yeah?" l said. "What about Patty Ryan?

47:38.402 --> 47:41.188
"What about Butch Kruger?
Who knocked them out?"

47:41.338 --> 47:42.857
"Well, who ain't?" he goes on.

47:43.007 --> 47:45.293
George, hold your tongue
and leave Jim alone.

47:45.443 --> 47:47.995
He's got another fine job,
and he's through with fighting.

47:48.145 --> 47:52.233
Ma, let him have one more.
Let him meet Choynski.

47:52.383 --> 47:55.921
-Yes, Ma, why don't you?
-Hello, here comes Pop.

47:57.955 --> 48:00.675
Oh, he's walking that tightrope again.

48:00.825 --> 48:03.066
Whoa, Pop, take off your skates.

48:03.994 --> 48:06.406
-Hello, Pop.
-Hi, Pop.

48:09.266 --> 48:12.486
l don't know that l should associate
with anybody here

48:12.636 --> 48:14.789
-after what happened to me today.
-What happened?

48:14.939 --> 48:17.124
-What did you do, Pop?
-What's the matter with your hand?

48:17.274 --> 48:18.926
-Do you see that hand?
-Yes, yeah.

48:19.076 --> 48:20.761
-Do you see it?
-What about it?

48:20.911 --> 48:24.932
Well, you're gazing on the hand
that shook the hand of John L. Sullivan.

48:25.082 --> 48:27.802
-John L. Sullivan.
-John L. Sullivan.

48:27.952 --> 48:30.604
-John Sullivan.
-John L. Sullivan.

48:30.754 --> 48:34.497
John L. Sullivan himself. Here it is.

48:35.626 --> 48:39.005
Well, what are you planning on doing
with it?

48:39.163 --> 48:41.734
l'm not even gonna wash it.

48:56.780 --> 48:59.818
Look out. Look out.
He'll hit you with his right.

49:00.484 --> 49:02.169
Hello, Miss Ware. Hello, Mr. Dewitt.

49:02.319 --> 49:04.905
Well, Corbett, we haven't seen you
since the evening of your...

49:05.055 --> 49:07.174
-your celebration.
-Yeah, that's right.

49:07.324 --> 49:09.610
Why, no, l dropped into the bank
a few days later,

49:09.760 --> 49:10.945
and they hadn't seen you, either.

49:11.095 --> 49:13.781
Oh, yes, yes. l resigned. Took a little trip.

49:13.931 --> 49:16.384
-Really? Where did you go?
-Salt Lake City.

49:16.534 --> 49:18.452
Salt Lake? Whatever did you go there for?

49:18.602 --> 49:21.241
Oh, l wanted to see the lake.

49:23.340 --> 49:25.513
Oh, excuse me.

49:28.312 --> 49:30.865
-Boy, that's the one that did it.
-Hello, John.

49:31.015 --> 49:33.801
-How are you? l'm glad to see you.
-Good heavens.

49:33.951 --> 49:36.037
Now, there's something that you can tell
your kids, lady.

49:36.187 --> 49:38.906
You've felt the arm what shook the world.
And the hand.

49:39.056 --> 49:40.775
She'll probably ask him
for an autographed picture.

49:40.925 --> 49:44.345
Possibly, she's the most unpredictable
young lady.

49:44.495 --> 49:45.446
Good night, miss.

49:45.596 --> 49:47.214
Where's my cab, boys?

49:47.364 --> 49:51.052
Gentlemen, my life is complete.
l just felt the arm what shook the world.

49:51.202 --> 49:52.853
What shook the world?

49:53.003 --> 49:55.089
Oh, Corbett, we were looking for a place
to have a little snack.

49:55.239 --> 49:56.957
-Would you care to join us?
-No, thanks. No, no.

49:57.107 --> 49:58.984
Oh, come on.

50:01.512 --> 50:03.082
Come and see the show!

50:04.748 --> 50:06.500
Sullivan the Great.

50:06.650 --> 50:08.536
That was certainly a pretty sight,
Miss Ware.

50:08.686 --> 50:11.605
You poring over Sullivan like that.
Why, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

50:11.755 --> 50:13.074
Carlton, what's he talking about?

50:13.224 --> 50:14.408
Yeah, what are you driving at, Corbett?

50:14.558 --> 50:16.677
Well, you ought to be ashamed of yourself,
too, for allowing it.

50:16.827 --> 50:19.246
-She's your girl, isn't she?
-How dare you?

50:19.396 --> 50:22.850
-Have you any idea who you're talking to?
-Well, l know l'm not talking to my girl.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.852
You know what l'd do with you
if you were my girl?

50:25.002 --> 50:27.488
l'd just put you right over my knee
and give you a good spanking.

50:27.638 --> 50:29.323
-What do you think of that?
-Your girl?

50:29.473 --> 50:31.992
Being your girl is so far
beyond my imagination...

50:32.142 --> 50:34.395
Look, Miss Ware,
let me tell you something.

50:34.545 --> 50:37.031
When a girl loses her dignity,
she loses something important.

50:37.181 --> 50:38.365
She loses class.

50:38.515 --> 50:41.735
And feeling that big lug's arm like that,
why, that's hero worship stuff...

50:41.885 --> 50:44.305
Look who he's calling a big lug.
John L. Sullivan.

50:44.455 --> 50:46.707
Now, come on. Let's stop fighting
about nothing. Come on.

50:46.857 --> 50:50.578
Oh, be quiet, Carlton.
You ought to knock his block off.

50:50.728 --> 50:53.647
Oh, don't do that, Dewitt.
l gotta fight Choynski next week.

50:53.797 --> 50:55.816
-Are you gonna fight Choynski?
-Yeah.

50:55.966 --> 51:00.254
Oh, please, Mr. Corbett. Fight Choynski.
lt's just what you need.

51:00.404 --> 51:02.990
That's the girl. You just keep pulling
for me to lose, will you?

51:03.140 --> 51:05.059
That's the way l like it.
Brings me good luck.

51:05.209 --> 51:07.695
Come on, Carlton.
Good night, Mr. Corbett.

51:07.845 --> 51:09.654
Good night.

51:10.881 --> 51:13.122
Thanks for the snack.

51:23.527 --> 51:24.912
Be sure you get all these things in, now.

51:25.062 --> 51:27.181
-Did you put in some sticking plaster?
-Don't forget the shoes.

51:27.331 --> 51:28.415
-And the towels.
-The best ones.

51:28.565 --> 51:30.451
-And look, there's his tights.
-Oh, they're pretty.

51:30.601 --> 51:32.353
Just like an acrobat's.

51:32.503 --> 51:34.922
Look at these things.
They look like a couple of boiled lobsters.

51:35.072 --> 51:36.790
Bare knuckles is the way to fight, l say.

51:36.940 --> 51:39.727
Don't you know it's bad luck
to wear your hats in the house?

51:39.877 --> 51:41.228
Where is the lad?

51:41.378 --> 51:43.731
Hey, Jim!
Stop brushing your hair and get started.

51:43.881 --> 51:46.133
Choynski'll think you ain't gonna show up.

51:46.283 --> 51:49.303
-lf l had my way, he wouldn't show up.
-Oh, now, Ma. Don't start that again.

51:49.453 --> 51:52.706
l'll speak my mind.
lt's like throwing a lamb to a wolf.

51:52.856 --> 51:54.942
-Oh, here he is.
-How are you, Jim?

51:55.092 --> 51:56.143
l got everything in the bag here.

51:56.293 --> 51:59.346
-All right.
-Come on, Jim. Let's go.

51:59.496 --> 52:00.781
You go ahead. l'll be right with you.

52:00.931 --> 52:03.240
-Now what?
-Oh, go ahead.

52:05.135 --> 52:09.015
Now, Ma. ls that a nice way to act?

52:09.340 --> 52:13.961
Why, if l knew you were at home crying
here, l couldn't win the fight.

52:14.111 --> 52:17.865
l can't help it, Jim.
l know no good will come of it.

52:18.015 --> 52:20.367
-And you'll get hurt.
-l won't get hurt.

52:20.517 --> 52:22.102
Why, he won't even touch me.

52:22.252 --> 52:24.638
And do you know what l'm gonna do
with the prize money?

52:24.788 --> 52:26.440
The first thing, l'm gonna buy you

52:26.590 --> 52:29.510
the most beautiful sealskin coat
you ever saw in your life.

52:29.660 --> 52:32.780
Will you like that?
Come on, give me a smile now.

52:32.930 --> 52:37.518
A nice big smile. Bigger. Bigger. Bigger.
That's the girl.

52:37.668 --> 52:39.286
Come on, Jim. You gonna wait all night?

52:39.436 --> 52:41.121
Yeah. Hurry it up, Jim.
What time you think it is?

52:41.271 --> 52:43.290
Come on. Hurry up.

52:43.440 --> 52:46.560
l'll be back in an hour.
Now, no more crying.

52:46.710 --> 52:48.746
Goodbye.

52:51.014 --> 52:53.100
-Jim.
-Yes, Mom?

52:53.250 --> 52:55.769
Do you think l'll look good
in a sealskin coat?

52:55.919 --> 52:57.938
Like a queen, Ma. Like a queen.

52:58.088 --> 53:00.625
Hey, Jim. Come on, we'll be late.

53:59.316 --> 54:00.834
-Hello, Judge.
-Oh, good luck.

54:00.984 --> 54:02.803
Mr. Huntington, Miss Ware.

54:02.953 --> 54:04.872
You all know my friend Walter Lowrie,
don't you?

54:05.022 --> 54:07.241
-Well, you bet l do. Very well.
-You ought to, Judge.

54:07.391 --> 54:08.842
Well, Miss Ware, if l get knocked out,

54:08.992 --> 54:10.311
l hope you throw a little water on me.

54:10.461 --> 54:14.048
When you get knocked out, Mr. Corbett,
l'll throw some champagne on you.

54:14.198 --> 54:16.283
Well, make sure it's good champagne.

54:16.433 --> 54:17.951
-Hello, Dewitt.
-Best of luck, Corbett.

54:18.101 --> 54:20.454
-Nice to have seen you.
-This is going to be sad.

54:20.604 --> 54:22.890
Corbett is a lamb
being led to the slaughter.

54:23.040 --> 54:26.180
Well, he needs some of that conceit
knocked out of him.

54:48.198 --> 54:50.542
So you showed up, huh?

54:52.102 --> 54:54.355
Hey, Pop, come here.
Bet this for me, will you?

54:54.505 --> 54:56.357
-What? Shall l bet the watch, too?
-Sure, bet it all.

54:56.507 --> 54:58.492
-Hello, Father.
-Jim, you're fighting a good lad.

54:58.642 --> 55:00.394
-Now, watch your left. Good luck to you.
-l know. All right, l will.

55:00.544 --> 55:01.929
-Knock him flat, Jim.
-Okay.

55:02.079 --> 55:03.263
-Good luck, Jim.
-All right, George.

55:03.413 --> 55:05.799
-Hey, you've got my good tie on, Harry.
-l'll take care of it.

55:05.949 --> 55:07.201
Well, mind you do.

55:07.351 --> 55:09.956
Who's got all that Choynski money?

55:13.457 --> 55:17.244
-Hey, the gloves ain't here.
-Shut up. Here, put these on.

55:17.394 --> 55:19.806
Come on. Get them on!

55:20.330 --> 55:24.437
-Hey, what is this?
-You'll cut him to ribbons with these.

55:28.071 --> 55:30.244
All right. Come on.

55:32.543 --> 55:33.827
Shake hands.

55:33.977 --> 55:36.630
Hey, what's the idea, Choynski?
Where's your boxing gloves?

55:36.780 --> 55:38.399
He lost them. That's what he did.
He lost them.

55:38.549 --> 55:39.900
Yeah? Well, he can't fight with those.

55:40.050 --> 55:42.536
Aw, nix on that. We won't fight you
without regulation gloves.

55:42.686 --> 55:44.138
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Billy.

55:44.288 --> 55:46.640
He can use gloves, no gloves,
bare knuckles.

55:46.790 --> 55:49.464
He can use a baseball bat if he wants.
Let's get started.

55:58.502 --> 56:02.746
l'm sheriff of this county,
and l'm stopping this fight.

56:49.753 --> 56:52.495
-He should've been a dancer.
-Yes.

57:10.000 --> 57:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:46.743 --> 57:48.677
Attaboy, Jim.

57:49.146 --> 57:51.298
You'll knock him flat, there.

57:51.448 --> 57:53.166
Hey! Don't muss my hair up.

57:53.316 --> 57:55.202
Listen, Tony, the guy's a dancing master.

57:55.352 --> 57:57.237
He'll dance himself out in a couple rounds.

57:57.387 --> 57:58.705
Just keep chopping with that left.

57:58.855 --> 58:00.607
When he opens up,
lower the boon with that right.

58:00.757 --> 58:02.543
You know what to do
when you're in there, sweetheart.

58:02.693 --> 58:05.078
Now, keep away from him, Jimmy.
He's pretty smart.

58:05.228 --> 58:06.413
Yeah.

58:06.563 --> 58:08.916
-But l know something he doesn't know.
-What's that?

58:09.066 --> 58:11.637
How hard he hit me with that right.

58:17.474 --> 58:19.510
Look out, Jim.

58:23.513 --> 58:25.432
-Come on.
-Give it to him, Joe. Give it to him.

58:25.582 --> 58:29.587
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

58:37.060 --> 58:42.840
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

58:48.872 --> 58:50.157
1, 2...

58:50.307 --> 58:52.359
-Will he get up? Will he get up?
-How do l know?

58:52.509 --> 58:53.827
-...3, 4...
-But you're his manager, ain't you?

58:53.977 --> 58:56.218
5, 6.

59:01.718 --> 59:04.858
1, 2, 3,

59:05.122 --> 59:08.558
4, 5, 6.

59:20.170 --> 59:21.455
Jimmy! Get up!

59:21.605 --> 59:24.791
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

59:24.941 --> 59:26.393
Hey, wait a minute. You can't go in there.

59:26.543 --> 59:29.217
l want to see that he gets a fair deal.

59:34.017 --> 59:39.125
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

59:45.362 --> 59:51.176
1, 2, 3, 4.

01:00:05.081 --> 01:00:08.268
Springtime's over. Take it easy.
Come on, don't get excited.

01:00:08.418 --> 01:00:10.570
The Olympic Club bunch are betting
against me, aren't they?

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.340
-Just about $15,000 worth.
-That's good.

01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:15.542
You're boxing pretty, Jim.
Just dance away from him.

01:00:15.692 --> 01:00:18.570
-And stick that left in his face.
-All right. All right.

01:00:19.296 --> 01:00:21.230
Get in there.

01:00:41.318 --> 01:00:43.889
You're all wet, Mr. Corbett.

01:00:47.624 --> 01:00:52.368
-Throw him a rope. Throw him a rope.
-Don't worry about a rope. He can swim.

01:00:55.065 --> 01:00:59.275
Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett.

01:01:15.552 --> 01:01:19.573
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

01:01:19.723 --> 01:01:24.729
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

01:02:17.147 --> 01:02:21.168
Mrs. Corbett. Mrs. Corbett.
Jim won. Jim won, Mrs. Corbett.

01:02:21.318 --> 01:02:23.737
Jim won! He knocked him out.
He won. Here he comes now.

01:02:23.887 --> 01:02:25.798
Come on, Jim.

01:02:29.492 --> 01:02:31.444
-Hello, Ma.
-Are you all right, Son?

01:02:31.594 --> 01:02:33.814
Oh, sure. Sure. He never even touched me.

01:02:33.964 --> 01:02:36.616
Ma, you should've been there.
Jim knocked him as cold as a cucumber.

01:02:36.766 --> 01:02:38.151
And Choynski was tough, Ma.

01:02:38.301 --> 01:02:40.387
Aw, Choynski couldn't punch a hole
in a pound of butter.

01:02:40.537 --> 01:02:42.455
-He knocked Jim out of the ring.
-Jim slipped.

01:02:42.605 --> 01:02:45.425
l never saw such a fight, Mrs. Corbett,
in all me days.

01:02:45.575 --> 01:02:47.460
Everything happened but a fire and a flood.

01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:49.229
Yeah, Ma. And because Jim won tonight,

01:02:49.379 --> 01:02:50.964
they want him to fight Jake Kilrain
in New Orleans,

01:02:51.114 --> 01:02:53.533
six rounds for $2,500.
What do you think of that?

01:02:53.683 --> 01:02:56.169
-And who is Kilrain?
-Who's Kilrain?

01:02:56.319 --> 01:02:57.470
Shut up.

01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:59.306
lt's a great mistake
for him to meet Kilrain.

01:02:59.456 --> 01:03:01.875
Kilrain's twice his size and a terror.

01:03:02.025 --> 01:03:04.511
-l saw him fight Sullivan.
-He's right, Jim.

01:03:04.661 --> 01:03:07.280
You're not ready for him yet.
He's a tough man and a bruiser.

01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:10.550
-But, Pa, l may be able to wear him down.
-What do you mean, wear him down?

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:11.952
Why, if Kilrain ever caught up to you,

01:03:12.102 --> 01:03:13.787
he'd knock you so cold
we'd have to thaw you out.

01:03:13.937 --> 01:03:15.555
That's a fine way to talk
about your own brother.

01:03:15.705 --> 01:03:17.224
-Why, for two cents l'd...
-Take it easy.

01:03:17.374 --> 01:03:19.292
-Here, cut that out.
-Jim ! Where's your new suit?

01:03:19.442 --> 01:03:24.220
Well, Ma, l didn't have time to...
Harry, what have you done with my tie?

01:03:24.914 --> 01:03:26.566
-Somebody must have copped it.
-Copped it?

01:03:26.716 --> 01:03:28.301
Pop, he says they copped it. My best tie...

01:03:28.451 --> 01:03:30.103
Quit squawking about a two-bit tie,
will you?

01:03:30.253 --> 01:03:32.392
A two-bit tie? l'll take...

01:03:33.156 --> 01:03:34.274
Mother, he's got no right to touch my ties.

01:03:34.424 --> 01:03:35.976
Come on and we'll have a cup of tea.

01:03:36.126 --> 01:03:38.178
The way he carries on,
you'd think l'd lost a diamond ring.

01:03:38.328 --> 01:03:40.747
You ain't even bright enough
to hold onto a tie, let alone a diamond.

01:03:40.897 --> 01:03:42.415
-Shut up, you, or l'll tie you in a knot.
-Yeah?

01:03:42.565 --> 01:03:44.084
-You and who else?
-Do you hear?

01:03:44.234 --> 01:03:47.112
lnto the barn! lnto the barn!

01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:49.841
Get in there! Come on!

01:03:55.145 --> 01:03:57.386
The Corbetts are at it again.

01:04:08.425 --> 01:04:10.343
-ls this seat taken?
-No, ma'am.

01:04:10.493 --> 01:04:12.545
-Would you care to sit by the window?
-No, thank you.

01:04:12.695 --> 01:04:16.650
-You're a gentleman, sir.
-Thank you, ma'am. And a scholar.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.371
-l said you're welcome.
-Oh.

01:04:22.439 --> 01:04:24.724
Are you going all the way to New Orleans?

01:04:24.874 --> 01:04:27.093
-Yes, ma'am.
-First time?

01:04:27.243 --> 01:04:29.382
First time, ma'am.

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:34.424
-How long do you expect to stay?
-Oh, about six rounds.

01:04:58.341 --> 01:05:01.861
ln Milwaukee, Corbett took
this Ed Kinney in four rounds, see?

01:05:02.011 --> 01:05:06.949
Well, Corbett's all right in the sticks, but
wait till he meets Charlie Mitchell, yeah.

01:05:09.385 --> 01:05:10.770
Thanks, gents.
What do you think of Corbett now?

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.353
A lucky guy.

01:05:49.092 --> 01:05:52.835
Why do people pay good money
to see him as an actor?

01:06:09.879 --> 01:06:11.398
Come on, folks.

01:06:11.548 --> 01:06:13.933
-Father Burke.
-Good luck to you, Pat.

01:06:14.083 --> 01:06:15.201
Thank you, Father.

01:06:15.351 --> 01:06:17.570
Don't close that door, Mary, it's bad luck.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.440
-Oh, Ma, don't be so superstitious.
-l'm not superstitious.

01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:23.209
But l'm taking no chances. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Kate.

01:06:23.359 --> 01:06:25.378
-Goodbye, Molly.
-Goodbye.

01:06:25.528 --> 01:06:27.547
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Mary. Be a good girl.

01:06:27.697 --> 01:06:29.682
Come on, Ma. Give me the lamp.

01:06:29.832 --> 01:06:31.217
Get in now and hurry it up,

01:06:31.367 --> 01:06:32.819
or l'll give the lamp
to the lady standing here.

01:06:32.969 --> 01:06:34.054
Give me the bird cage.

01:06:34.204 --> 01:06:37.791
What're you dragging this thing
around for? The bird died five years ago.

01:06:37.941 --> 01:06:40.560
-Here, take this.
-Oh, stop crying, Ma.

01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:41.728
-Take this.
-You should be glad

01:06:41.878 --> 01:06:44.731
-to be moving to Nob Hill.
-You'll be living amongst the big bugs.

01:06:44.881 --> 01:06:45.932
Goodbye, Nora.

01:06:46.082 --> 01:06:48.268
We'll be up to see you
as soon as you get settled.

01:06:48.418 --> 01:06:50.904
Don't bring your old man if he ain't sober.

01:06:51.054 --> 01:06:53.796
Well, don't bring him if he is.

01:06:54.424 --> 01:06:55.875
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

01:06:56.025 --> 01:06:57.077
Goodbye.

01:06:57.227 --> 01:07:00.547
Ain't it strange and wonderful, Father,
how the right hand of God

01:07:00.697 --> 01:07:04.184
-reaches down to help the poor?
-Yes, Mrs. Casey.

01:07:04.334 --> 01:07:07.747
But this time he had the help
of a very good left.

01:07:19.415 --> 01:07:22.828
Quiet! Quiet!

01:07:23.186 --> 01:07:24.838
Quiet!

01:07:24.988 --> 01:07:27.040
Quiet, the lot of you!

01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:28.641
Quiet!

01:07:28.791 --> 01:07:31.726
The drinks are on my boy, Jim.

01:07:34.664 --> 01:07:37.668
He gave his family a beautiful home
on Nob Hill.

01:07:38.568 --> 01:07:41.913
He gave his mother
a beautiful sealskin coat, too.

01:07:42.305 --> 01:07:45.758
And he bought this saloon
for his two brothers.

01:07:45.908 --> 01:07:50.196
And he sends his best regards
to the lot of you from New York.

01:07:50.346 --> 01:07:51.998
And what's more,

01:07:52.148 --> 01:07:54.534
he can lick any man in the world.

01:07:54.684 --> 01:07:56.269
And we're not even excluding...

01:07:56.419 --> 01:07:58.004
-John.
-L.

01:07:58.154 --> 01:07:59.895
Sullivan.

01:08:34.756 --> 01:08:36.975
Boy, can that Sullivan swing an ax.
Look at those chips fly.

01:08:37.126 --> 01:08:40.313
Hey, Jim, in your show
you ought to saw a tree in two.

01:08:40.462 --> 01:08:42.215
Shut up, will you? He's terrible.

01:08:42.365 --> 01:08:45.710
Besides, the log was practically chopped
when the curtain went up.

01:08:47.937 --> 01:08:51.558
What a ham, acting with an ax.

01:08:51.707 --> 01:08:54.627
He probably has to chop wood
because he can't remember lines.

01:08:54.777 --> 01:08:57.663
Well, he's still the champ, Jim.
You can't take that away from him.

01:08:57.814 --> 01:08:59.131
Yeah, what a ham.

01:08:59.282 --> 01:09:01.751
-Yeah.
-What a ham.

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.876
What a ham.

01:09:37.353 --> 01:09:41.608
Say, John, who do you think's sitting
out there, in a box with his manager?

01:09:41.758 --> 01:09:44.844
How should l know?
One of my challengers, l suppose.

01:09:44.993 --> 01:09:47.412
l'm gonna have to begin to wade
through the tramps, l guess.

01:09:47.563 --> 01:09:51.718
This is no tramp, John.
This is James J. Corbett himself.

01:09:51.868 --> 01:09:54.554
Corbett himself. Corbett himself?

01:09:54.704 --> 01:09:56.556
Where do you get the
"Corbett himself" stuff?

01:09:56.706 --> 01:09:59.692
Well, at least he's proved
he's one of the best contenders.

01:09:59.842 --> 01:10:02.528
Look at that 61-round draw
with Peter Jackson.

01:10:02.678 --> 01:10:06.432
Peter Jackson.
Do you mean Peter Jackson himself?

01:10:06.582 --> 01:10:09.168
Do you mean Charlie Mitchell himself?

01:10:09.318 --> 01:10:11.704
Say, there's only one man in the world
you can call himself,

01:10:11.854 --> 01:10:16.291
-and that's the champion himself.
-Yeah, that's right, John.

01:10:16.793 --> 01:10:21.503
-Come in.
-Mr. Sullivan, Mr. James J. Corbett.

01:10:21.697 --> 01:10:25.551
-Mr. Sullivan.
-Mr. James J. Corbett himself.

01:10:25.701 --> 01:10:28.588
Well, l'm glad to meet Mr. Corbett himself.

01:10:28.738 --> 01:10:31.047
And it's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

01:10:33.543 --> 01:10:35.461
-Quite a grip you have there.
-Sit down. Sit down, Mr. Corbett.

01:10:35.611 --> 01:10:37.363
-Thank you very much.
-Have a drink. Have a drink.

01:10:37.513 --> 01:10:39.132
No, thanks. l'm on the wagon.

01:10:39.282 --> 01:10:42.402
You don't tell me. On the wagon, is it?

01:10:42.552 --> 01:10:44.520
On the wagon itself!

01:10:46.722 --> 01:10:49.275
Well, l've been a long time trying
to meet you, Mr. Sullivan.

01:10:49.425 --> 01:10:54.013
l've seen you around San Francisco a few
times but from a long distance, of course.

01:10:54.163 --> 01:10:58.551
Well, seeing me from a long distance
is a smart idea, young fella.

01:10:58.701 --> 01:11:01.587
What is all this nonsense about you
wanting to meet me in the ring?

01:11:01.737 --> 01:11:03.756
Peter Jackson thought
it was a lot of nonsense, too.

01:11:03.906 --> 01:11:05.058
A little salt, please, Mr. Sullivan.

01:11:05.208 --> 01:11:06.359
-Right.
-Thank you.

01:11:06.509 --> 01:11:09.162
How long was it you stayed with Jackson,
16 rounds?

01:11:09.312 --> 01:11:11.664
Now, Mr. Sullivan,
you know better than that.

01:11:11.814 --> 01:11:13.266
Why don't you just
turn those figures around?

01:11:13.416 --> 01:11:15.101
lt was 61 rounds.

01:11:15.251 --> 01:11:17.770
How long do you think
Jackson would stay with me?

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.206
Sixty-one seconds, sir.

01:11:20.356 --> 01:11:23.443
Well, that must explain why you've been
ducking him all this time, l suppose.

01:11:23.593 --> 01:11:24.777
Too easy, huh?

01:11:24.927 --> 01:11:26.612
Duck? Did you say duck?

01:11:26.762 --> 01:11:30.049
l'll meet any man who will stand
on his own two feet,

01:11:30.199 --> 01:11:34.520
and if you had about 30 pounds
more on you, you'd be the first one, sir.

01:11:34.670 --> 01:11:36.756
l'll return the compliment, Mr. Sullivan.

01:11:36.906 --> 01:11:39.892
lf you'd fight me,
l'd just wish you were five years younger.

01:11:40.042 --> 01:11:41.394
What do you mean by that?

01:11:41.544 --> 01:11:43.162
Not much fun winning the championship

01:11:43.312 --> 01:11:45.724
from a guy who's practically
tripping over his beard.

01:11:47.183 --> 01:11:49.435
Beard, is it? Who's got a beard?

01:11:49.585 --> 01:11:52.004
Why, you fresh brat,
who do you think you're talking to?

01:11:52.154 --> 01:11:53.539
John L. Sullivan himself.

01:11:53.689 --> 01:11:56.976
l'll have you know that
l can lick any man in the world.

01:11:57.126 --> 01:11:59.545
All except one, Mr. Sullivan.
All except one.

01:11:59.695 --> 01:12:00.680
-ls that so?
-John.

01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:02.048
-Why, you...
-Your steak is getting cold.

01:12:02.198 --> 01:12:04.384
-l don't care. Get him out of here.
-Come on, Jim. Don't give it away.

01:12:04.534 --> 01:12:07.820
Get him out of here before l murder him.
Call the newspaper boys in.

01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:10.223
l'll fight that blabbermouth anytime,
anywhere.

01:12:10.373 --> 01:12:13.025
Nobody can talk like that to me.
l don't care...

01:12:13.175 --> 01:12:16.062
Get him out of here.
Yeah, get him out of here.

01:12:16.212 --> 01:12:18.231
-Who does he think he is?
-Oh, what's the matter with you?

01:12:18.381 --> 01:12:19.832
Why, the man is insane.

01:12:19.982 --> 01:12:21.667
l'm the champion of the world,
l'll have you know.

01:12:21.817 --> 01:12:24.559
-l know, John. But eat your steak.
-l'll eat my steak...

01:12:25.621 --> 01:12:27.407
Did you hear what he said, Billy?
He's gonna fight me.

01:12:27.557 --> 01:12:29.442
-Yeah, how'd you do it, Jim?
-How'd you ever get him so mad?

01:12:29.592 --> 01:12:31.511
l just told him a few things
and got his goat.

01:12:31.661 --> 01:12:33.800
Hey, we're gonna fight Sullivan.

01:12:35.231 --> 01:12:37.450
Boy, did he fall for it. Listen to this.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.986
"l hereby accept the challenge
of James J. Corbett

01:12:40.136 --> 01:12:43.523
"to fight me the first week
of September this year, 1892,

01:12:43.673 --> 01:12:47.059
"at New Orleans, Louisiana,
for a purse of $25,000,

01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:51.180
-"winner take all."
-$25,000.

01:12:51.814 --> 01:12:53.232
Do you know what l think l'll do, Billy?

01:12:53.382 --> 01:12:55.868
l'm gonna buy myself a theater
and play Hamlet.

01:12:56.018 --> 01:12:58.438
Hamlet? Yeah.

01:12:58.588 --> 01:13:01.974
"Furthermore, l insist upon a side bet
of $10,000 to make certain

01:13:02.124 --> 01:13:05.878
-"that Corbett will show up for the fight."
-Show up?

01:13:06.028 --> 01:13:08.881
l'll be there before and after
that big windbag.

01:13:09.031 --> 01:13:12.137
Yeah, l know that,
but where are we going to get $10,000?

01:13:12.301 --> 01:13:15.988
Hey, what about borrowing back some of
that dough you sent your family, huh?

01:13:16.138 --> 01:13:17.924
Oh, no. l'd never do that, Billy.
l gave it to them.

01:13:18.074 --> 01:13:20.059
All right. Then why fool ourselves?

01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:22.695
Jim, at your weight,
there ain't a man in the country

01:13:22.845 --> 01:13:24.931
that'll risk one dime on you
against Sullivan.

01:13:25.081 --> 01:13:28.534
-Would you?
-Well, that ain't hardly a fair question, Jim.

01:13:28.684 --> 01:13:30.703
All right, Billy. But l'll tell you this.

01:13:30.853 --> 01:13:33.172
We haven't come this far together
to miss the big chance

01:13:33.322 --> 01:13:36.209
just for the sake of a few thousand bucks.
l'll get it somehow.

01:13:36.359 --> 01:13:38.244
Well, that kind of dough
don't grow on trees, Jim.

01:13:38.394 --> 01:13:42.638
-l know it, but l'll get it somehow.
-All right.

01:13:47.637 --> 01:13:50.790
But look, l'll run rings around the guy.
l'll tie him up in knots.

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:55.061
-Oh, it's only $10,000.
-l'm sorry, Jim, but this is final. No.

01:13:55.211 --> 01:13:57.330
Well, you're missing a good chance.
Thanks anyway, Charlie.

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:00.825
-Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett.
-Yes?

01:14:01.484 --> 01:14:03.369
Senator Gage would like
to speak to you, sir.

01:14:03.519 --> 01:14:07.330
Senator Gage? Oh, is it...
What do you mean Senator Gage?

01:14:14.063 --> 01:14:18.384
-Vicki! Oh, l'm so glad to see you.
-Hello, Mr. Corbett.

01:14:18.534 --> 01:14:21.053
Why, l'm so glad to see you, l'm surprised.
How are you?

01:14:21.203 --> 01:14:24.724
-l'm fine. My, you're looking well.
-Oh, thanks.

01:14:24.874 --> 01:14:27.593
l can't get over how glad l am to see you.
Look, l want to talk to you.

01:14:27.743 --> 01:14:29.629
-Where shall we go? What'll we do?
-Well, let's sit over here.

01:14:29.779 --> 01:14:31.898
-But l only have a minute.
-Oh, have you gotta go somewhere?

01:14:32.048 --> 01:14:34.200
Yes, l have to go upstairs
and change for dinner.

01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:37.436
-Oh.
-Well, what have you been doing lately?

01:14:37.586 --> 01:14:41.474
Oh, l've... What have l been doing?
Why, haven't you heard?

01:14:41.624 --> 01:14:45.444
Oh, yes, of course, l beg your pardon.
How long have you been in New York?

01:14:45.594 --> 01:14:46.679
Oh, l'll tell you about that.

01:14:46.829 --> 01:14:48.281
Look, why don't you run upstairs
and get changed,

01:14:48.431 --> 01:14:49.815
and then let me take you out to dinner?

01:14:49.965 --> 01:14:51.384
Oh, there's a new play
opening at the Empire.

01:14:51.534 --> 01:14:53.653
-Would you like to go?
-Oh, l'm going there with the Belmonts.

01:14:53.803 --> 01:14:55.021
-Sorry.
-Oh.

01:14:55.171 --> 01:14:58.778
-Well, let's have dinner first.
-No, l'm dining at Delmonico's.

01:14:59.041 --> 01:15:00.393
Oh, l see. You're all tied up, huh?

01:15:00.543 --> 01:15:02.395
-Well, how about lunch tomorrow?
-Sorry.

01:15:02.545 --> 01:15:05.264
-Well, dinner tomorrow night.
-Sorry.

01:15:05.414 --> 01:15:07.333
Are you gonna be sorry
all day Wednesday?

01:15:07.483 --> 01:15:10.169
My dear Mr. Corbett,
l'm engaged for the next three weeks.

01:15:10.319 --> 01:15:13.573
-Every single moment.
-Three weeks. Oh, that's too bad.

01:15:13.723 --> 01:15:15.841
lt's nice to have seen you again,
but l really must go.

01:15:15.991 --> 01:15:17.109
l have to dress for dinner.

01:15:17.259 --> 01:15:18.544
How long did you say
you've been in New York?

01:15:18.694 --> 01:15:20.313
Couple of weeks. Why?

01:15:20.463 --> 01:15:22.915
That's good. You'd better not
stick around much longer.

01:15:23.065 --> 01:15:25.618
-lt doesn't agree with you.
-What are you talking about?

01:15:25.768 --> 01:15:26.986
Why, you've got about the best case

01:15:27.136 --> 01:15:29.188
l've seen in a long time
of social butterfly itch.

01:15:29.338 --> 01:15:31.524
You've got the jumps.
That's what's the matter with you.

01:15:31.674 --> 01:15:35.561
"l'm so sorry, Mr. Corbett,
but l'm busy for the next three weeks."

01:15:35.711 --> 01:15:38.464
That's marvelous. When l said l was glad
to see you, l must have been crazy.

01:15:38.614 --> 01:15:39.665
-Mr. Corbett.
-Yes?

01:15:39.815 --> 01:15:41.467
What amuses me, what really amuses me

01:15:41.617 --> 01:15:43.235
is how you could think
l'd go anywhere with you,

01:15:43.385 --> 01:15:45.471
-even if l were marooned.
-Oh, is that so?

01:15:45.621 --> 01:15:46.706
Well, if it's famous people

01:15:46.856 --> 01:15:48.808
that's swelling that lovely, dumb,
blonde head of yours,

01:15:48.958 --> 01:15:51.344
let me tell you when l take a girl out,
she really gets to see something.

01:15:51.494 --> 01:15:54.013
l stop the traffic in San Francisco, anyway.

01:15:54.163 --> 01:15:56.215
Oh, listen to who's famous.

01:15:56.365 --> 01:15:58.184
Just because you're a two-bit prize fighter,
you...

01:15:58.334 --> 01:16:00.920
A two-bit prize fighter? Listen,
if you ever get to doing as well socially

01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:02.822
as l do prize fighting,
you'll do all right, kiddo.

01:16:02.972 --> 01:16:04.256
One of these days,
you can tell your friends

01:16:04.406 --> 01:16:06.192
you nearly went out on a date
with Jim Corbett.

01:16:06.342 --> 01:16:09.328
Well, l see you two have picked up
the conversation right where you left off.

01:16:09.478 --> 01:16:10.863
-Hello, Mr. Ware.
-How are you, Jim?

01:16:11.013 --> 01:16:12.465
Fine, thanks. lt's good to see you.

01:16:12.615 --> 01:16:15.701
Dad, it's unbelievable.
lt's a study of a bank clerk gone crazy.

01:16:15.851 --> 01:16:17.937
You'd better get her out of New York,
Mr. Ware.

01:16:18.087 --> 01:16:21.140
-Better get her back to that nice Dewitt.
-l can't. They've had a fight, too.

01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:24.477
No kidding?
l didn't know he had that much sense.

01:16:24.627 --> 01:16:26.245
Why, you glorified pug, you.

01:16:26.395 --> 01:16:28.648
Well, l'm blamed,
if l ever saw anything like you two.

01:16:28.798 --> 01:16:30.683
lf you don't like each other,
why in Sam Hill

01:16:30.833 --> 01:16:32.151
do you have to make
so much noise about it?

01:16:32.301 --> 01:16:35.788
Dad, get this gentleman,
this gentleman Jim Corbett.

01:16:35.938 --> 01:16:38.658
He actually asked me to go
to the opening with him tonight.

01:16:38.808 --> 01:16:41.927
-This tinhorn, shanty lrishman.
-Well, who isn't?

01:16:42.077 --> 01:16:43.562
Only difference is
we've got a bigger shanty.

01:16:43.712 --> 01:16:46.899
Of course she doesn't like famous people,
Mr. Ware, not much.

01:16:47.049 --> 01:16:49.235
Remember the time you felt
Sullivan's arm like this?

01:16:49.385 --> 01:16:51.387
You got a kick out of that, didn't you?

01:16:52.188 --> 01:16:57.626
"Gentleman Jim."
l never really saw the joke until now.

01:16:59.595 --> 01:17:02.615
Well, l never saw anything
get her so upset before.

01:17:02.765 --> 01:17:04.150
Yeah.

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:07.353
Tinhorn lrishman. Oh, by the way,

01:17:07.503 --> 01:17:09.789
you don't happen to have $10,000
you could lend me, do you?

01:17:09.939 --> 01:17:13.375
-Ten... What for?
-Sullivan's side bet, you know?

01:17:13.542 --> 01:17:14.794
Oh, Jim, l'm sorry.

01:17:14.944 --> 01:17:17.463
l'm a gambler, but l've got to have
some run for my money.

01:17:17.613 --> 01:17:18.998
l guess so.

01:17:19.148 --> 01:17:20.900
Say, maybe Vicki'll dig it up for you.

01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:23.235
Yeah. l got a picture of that.
Well, it's good to see you.

01:17:23.385 --> 01:17:28.266
-You two are the funniest couple.
-Yeah. Well, so long.

01:17:28.881 --> 01:17:30.866
What'll happen
if they can't raise the side bet?

01:17:31.016 --> 01:17:32.802
Oh, they'll just call the fight off.

01:17:32.952 --> 01:17:35.071
Nearly everybody's
given it up now anyhow.

01:17:35.221 --> 01:17:37.606
You know, Dad, it's a great pity

01:17:37.756 --> 01:17:40.600
that Mr. Corbett has to miss
such good shellacking.

01:17:40.793 --> 01:17:43.000
l feel very cheated.

01:17:43.262 --> 01:17:46.882
Do you really dislike him so much?
What does he do now? What is it?

01:17:47.032 --> 01:17:50.119
l get furious every time l think about him.

01:17:50.269 --> 01:17:52.121
Then why do you think about him at all?

01:17:52.271 --> 01:17:55.741
l can't help it.
l keep running into him everywhere l go.

01:17:55.975 --> 01:18:00.062
Every time l pick up a newspaper, there's
a picture of him, smirking like a tomcat.

01:18:00.212 --> 01:18:03.557
Every time l turn a corner,
there's a big poster of him.

01:18:05.517 --> 01:18:09.738
l'd give anything in the world
to see him just once flat on his back

01:18:09.888 --> 01:18:12.274
with all that ego knocked out of him.

01:18:12.424 --> 01:18:14.477
Well, you won't see Sullivan do it

01:18:14.627 --> 01:18:18.514
unless Jim and Delaney can dig up
an angel somewhere,

01:18:18.664 --> 01:18:21.576
an angel who doesn't mind being clipped.

01:18:41.186 --> 01:18:42.571
Oh, how do you do, Miss Ware?

01:18:42.721 --> 01:18:44.540
l got your note
and came right over to see you.

01:18:44.690 --> 01:18:45.708
Thank you, Mr. Delaney.

01:18:45.858 --> 01:18:47.409
Well, you can just call me Billy,
if you don't mind.

01:18:47.559 --> 01:18:49.478
All right, Billy. How have you been?

01:18:49.628 --> 01:18:53.782
-l've got a fine load of troubles, thank you.
-Yes, l heard about that. lt's a shame.

01:18:53.932 --> 01:18:55.050
Can you beat that for hard luck?

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.720
l wanna tell you, Miss Ware, that Jim and l
are so worried we can't sleep.

01:18:57.870 --> 01:18:58.888
We can't hardly eat.

01:18:59.038 --> 01:19:02.291
Why, he's down to 165 pounds,
practically a bantam weight.

01:19:02.441 --> 01:19:05.127
Really? He seemed very fresh and cocky
this afternoon.

01:19:05.277 --> 01:19:07.396
Oh, don't let that fool you, ma'am.
He's just acting.

01:19:07.546 --> 01:19:10.266
l tell you, all he does is sit in his room
all day and all night,

01:19:10.416 --> 01:19:14.670
just eating his heart out because
he can't get some backer with $10,000.

01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:16.338
-Mr. Delaney?
-Yes, ma'am?

01:19:16.488 --> 01:19:18.841
lf l loaned you the money,
will you give me your word of honor

01:19:18.991 --> 01:19:20.342
never to tell Corbett where it came from?

01:19:20.492 --> 01:19:21.911
You ain't just kidding me?

01:19:22.061 --> 01:19:24.680
No, l happen to have a personal reason
for wanting to see the fight.

01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:27.816
Oh, l get it. You want to get in on some
of that 8-to-1 Sullivan dough, huh?

01:19:27.966 --> 01:19:30.019
And clean up. Why, you'll make a killing.

01:19:30.169 --> 01:19:32.054
No, l don't want it to go quite that far.

01:19:32.204 --> 01:19:34.557
-Just far enough to enjoy.
-l see.

01:19:34.707 --> 01:19:37.860
Now, promise me
you'll never tell him, ever.

01:19:38.010 --> 01:19:40.396
Not a word, not a word, ma'am,
l promise you.

01:19:40.546 --> 01:19:43.866
l knew there'd be somebody from
San Francisco who wouldn't let us down.

01:19:44.016 --> 01:19:47.020
Thanks, miss. Thanks, you're a darling.

01:20:09.641 --> 01:20:10.000
Why, Vicki, isn't that Anna Held?

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.248
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
Why, Vicki, isn't that Anna Held?

01:20:13.248 --> 01:20:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:23.222 --> 01:20:25.759
lsn't she lovely?

01:20:27.025 --> 01:20:29.411
She always has
the most handsome men with her.

01:20:29.561 --> 01:20:31.680
May l borrow your glasses a minute, dear?

01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:33.415
Oh, l beg your pardon.

01:20:33.565 --> 01:20:38.503
l want to see if that really is a Greek god
with her, or just an old woman's mirage.

01:20:41.507 --> 01:20:44.159
l guess it's true
what they're saying about those two.

01:20:44.309 --> 01:20:45.361
What?

01:20:45.511 --> 01:20:49.789
That she put up the $10,000
for Corbett to meet Sullivan.

01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:12.788
Ten John L's.
l'll give you six Corbetts for one.

01:21:12.938 --> 01:21:14.849
What do you take me for?

01:22:33.452 --> 01:22:35.537
That hot sun out there
ain't gonna do Sullivan no good.

01:22:35.687 --> 01:22:39.141
But that's what he likes,
parades, noise, hand-shaking.

01:22:39.291 --> 01:22:42.111
But l know how to take care of a fighter.
Now, look at this place,

01:22:42.261 --> 01:22:46.148
-nice, quiet and peaceful.
-Yeah, just like a museum.

01:22:46.298 --> 01:22:47.883
Quiet.

01:22:48.033 --> 01:22:52.955
Beautiful. You know, Billy, this guy,
Shakespeare, really knew his drama.

01:22:53.105 --> 01:22:55.758
l think l'm gonna play this instead of
Lily, The Mad Duchess.

01:22:55.908 --> 01:22:57.493
Watch the way the guy comes in.

01:22:57.643 --> 01:22:59.361
-Watch this, Billy.
-We're watching, Jim.

01:22:59.511 --> 01:23:00.529
Yeah. Yeah.

01:23:00.679 --> 01:23:02.398
You see?
Hey, he's been out in the garden. See?

01:23:02.548 --> 01:23:05.392
-Now he comes in, watch this.
-All right.

01:23:07.352 --> 01:23:09.024
Hark...

01:23:24.069 --> 01:23:25.554
Sit down and play us a tune.

01:23:25.704 --> 01:23:28.590
-Oh, not now, Pa.
-Oh, yeah, Mary. Come on.

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:29.691
Come on, play.

01:23:29.841 --> 01:23:31.360
Why am l paying for all these lessons
if you won't play?

01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:33.662
-Pat, sing us a song.
-That l will.

01:23:33.812 --> 01:23:35.917
Line up. Mary.

01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:47.361
l hope you break a leg.

01:24:03.542 --> 01:24:06.462
Oh, look at those maniacs!

01:24:06.612 --> 01:24:09.465
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

01:24:09.615 --> 01:24:13.235
What do you mean barging in here
like a herd of wild elephants?

01:24:13.385 --> 01:24:15.160
Did you call me an elephant?

01:24:20.258 --> 01:24:21.777
Will you shut up?

01:24:21.927 --> 01:24:24.513
Pat, l'm sure
that Mr. Delaney meant no harm.

01:24:24.663 --> 01:24:27.182
Thank you, Mrs. Corbett.
l did mean no harm.

01:24:27.332 --> 01:24:29.767
-We'll have none of that.
-Oh, shut up!

01:24:32.804 --> 01:24:36.158
-The Corbetts are at it again.
-Stand aside!

01:24:36.308 --> 01:24:39.186
-Stand aside!
-l hope they kill each other.

01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:56.578
l think you gentlemen
are in the wrong seats.

01:24:56.728 --> 01:24:58.680
Go on. You belong on the other side.

01:24:58.830 --> 01:25:01.383
-Boys!
-You belong on the other side.

01:25:01.533 --> 01:25:03.535
Get out of there.

01:25:06.271 --> 01:25:08.615
What do you think of them guys?
l'd like to...

01:25:16.415 --> 01:25:18.918
Has anybody got any Sullivan money?

01:25:27.059 --> 01:25:29.711
Now, don't get excited, Jim.
Don't let it rattle you.

01:25:29.861 --> 01:25:31.947
Who's excited?
Look, he's gonna shake my arm off.

01:25:32.097 --> 01:25:33.916
-Here, you do it, Walter.
-l can't, Jim.

01:25:34.066 --> 01:25:35.517
l couldn't even button
my vest this morning.

01:25:35.667 --> 01:25:37.052
-Well, how am l gonna...
-Come on, Corbett, hurry up.

01:25:37.202 --> 01:25:39.321
The referee's in the ring
and Sullivan's waiting to follow you in.

01:25:39.471 --> 01:25:42.816
-Hey, wait a minute, Donovan.
-Well, what now?

01:25:43.275 --> 01:25:45.260
You say Sullivan's waiting for me
to go into the ring first?

01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:47.329
-Of course!
-What do you mean "of course"?

01:25:47.479 --> 01:25:49.097
Because John L. Sullivan,
the champion of the world,

01:25:49.247 --> 01:25:50.599
is a very superstitious man.

01:25:50.749 --> 01:25:52.935
And he's famous enough
to rate that privilege.

01:25:53.085 --> 01:25:55.771
Oh, well. Oh, l don't expect any privileges.

01:25:55.921 --> 01:25:58.373
But l think l ought to get an even break.
Maybe l'm superstitious.

01:25:58.523 --> 01:26:00.976
-Well, of all the brass.
-What are you trying to pull, Corbett?

01:26:01.126 --> 01:26:03.312
-What are you trying to pull?
-Who do you think you are?

01:26:03.462 --> 01:26:05.999
-Who do you think he is?
-Throw him out, Delaney.

01:26:06.932 --> 01:26:09.551
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
l'll tell you what l'll do.

01:26:09.701 --> 01:26:10.986
l'll compromise.

01:26:11.136 --> 01:26:12.854
We'll both get in the ring
at the same time.

01:26:13.004 --> 01:26:16.091
He won't do it,
and l won't insult him by asking.

01:26:16.241 --> 01:26:18.627
Well, suit yourselves, gentlemen.
l got plenty of time.

01:26:18.777 --> 01:26:21.964
-l'll just take a little nap.
-Take it easy, Jim. Lay down. Go on.

01:26:22.114 --> 01:26:25.067
Go on. Go on. Get out of here.

01:26:25.217 --> 01:26:30.098
Oh, don't shut that door like that, Walter.
You know it's bad luck.

01:26:33.792 --> 01:26:34.977
There's a free-for-all going on downstairs.

01:26:35.127 --> 01:26:37.512
Sullivan won't get in the ring first
and Corbett says he won't, either.

01:26:37.662 --> 01:26:39.648
They're both superstitious
so they're both going in together.

01:26:39.798 --> 01:26:41.368
Here comes Corbett now.

01:26:46.738 --> 01:26:48.624
How are you, boys? Nice to see you.
Hello, Judge.

01:26:48.774 --> 01:26:49.725
-Hello.
-Hello, Miss Ware.

01:26:49.875 --> 01:26:51.660
-Was that you booing just now?
-Yes.

01:26:51.810 --> 01:26:55.121
-l thought so.
-Boo!

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.386
Now we both get through
at the same time, all right?

01:27:17.536 --> 01:27:19.187
-All right, all right.
-Right.

01:27:19.337 --> 01:27:20.555
-Ready?
-Yes.

01:27:20.705 --> 01:27:22.309
Let's go.

01:27:22.941 --> 01:27:24.426
What is the idea?

01:27:24.576 --> 01:27:27.181
Just for that,
l'll knock you flat in the first round.

01:27:30.649 --> 01:27:33.152
-Be quiet.
-But l don't care.

01:27:38.690 --> 01:27:42.044
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:27:42.194 --> 01:27:45.147
A fight to the finish

01:27:45.297 --> 01:27:49.584
for the heavyweight championship
of the world.

01:27:49.734 --> 01:27:54.556
ln this corner, introducing at 178,

01:27:54.706 --> 01:27:58.960
from San Francisco, the challenger,

01:27:59.110 --> 01:28:03.183
James J. Corbett.

01:28:12.924 --> 01:28:15.165
He thinks he's playing Hamlet.

01:28:17.829 --> 01:28:21.583
ln this corner at 212,

01:28:21.733 --> 01:28:24.386
the world's champion.

01:28:24.536 --> 01:28:26.521
From Boston,

01:28:26.671 --> 01:28:30.881
John L. Sullivan.

01:28:40.452 --> 01:28:42.591
Let her go.

01:28:46.224 --> 01:28:48.610
You men must observe
the Marquess of Queensberry rules

01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:50.545
under which this championship battle
is to be fought.

01:28:50.695 --> 01:28:51.813
No foul punches.

01:28:51.963 --> 01:28:54.015
When l tell you to break,
you step back clean.

01:28:54.165 --> 01:28:55.317
No punches in the breakaway.

01:28:55.467 --> 01:28:57.586
Now, shake hands
and come out fighting with the bell.

01:28:57.736 --> 01:29:00.740
Watch your beard now, Mr. Sullivan.
Don't trip over it.

01:29:52.090 --> 01:29:54.297
Steady, Jim. Steady.

01:30:41.172 --> 01:30:43.208
Left jab!

01:31:04.796 --> 01:31:09.040
-Move around!
-Knock him over, Jim!

01:31:12.203 --> 01:31:15.115
Come on, Jim. Come on.

01:31:56.481 --> 01:31:58.199
The end of round three.

01:31:58.349 --> 01:32:01.159
A thousand says
Corbett won't come up for the sixth.

01:32:03.488 --> 01:32:05.832
Seems like all this Corbett fella wants...

01:32:18.636 --> 01:32:22.524
-Got any results from the fight yet, Jim?
-Just coming over now.

01:32:22.674 --> 01:32:24.826
Sullivan looked very tired in the 17th.

01:32:24.976 --> 01:32:29.015
Pardon me. The 19th round, sir.
Sullivan hasn't laid a glove on him.

01:32:30.081 --> 01:32:32.467
Here's another fight report, boys.

01:32:32.617 --> 01:32:37.191
lt's the end of the 20th round.
Corbett's still going great.

01:33:00.445 --> 01:33:02.288
That's it, Jim.

01:33:22.734 --> 01:33:24.440
Get him, Jim.

01:34:06.611 --> 01:34:08.181
Get him, Jim.

01:34:34.672 --> 01:34:39.815
1, 2, 3, 4,

01:34:40.211 --> 01:34:45.615
5, 6, 7, 8,

01:34:45.817 --> 01:34:48.422
9, 10!

01:34:57.762 --> 01:35:00.615
The winner and new

01:35:00.765 --> 01:35:04.385
heavyweight champion of the world,

01:35:04.535 --> 01:35:07.971
James J. Corbett!

01:35:11.142 --> 01:35:13.952
Hurray, hurray, Jim!

01:35:27.158 --> 01:35:29.297
Come on, come on. Right here.

01:35:57.455 --> 01:35:59.140
Go on, Ma.
You and Pa go out and take a bow.

01:35:59.290 --> 01:36:00.808
Don't let him fall over, though.
Go on, Mary.

01:36:00.958 --> 01:36:03.311
No, l don't want to. l want to go with you.

01:36:03.461 --> 01:36:06.881
This is a historic occasion, Vicki.
A new king takes the throne.

01:36:07.031 --> 01:36:09.450
With all the pomp and glory.
And does he love it.

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:10.818
Do you think it's gone to his head?

01:36:10.968 --> 01:36:13.471
Wait a second. l'll show you what l think.

01:36:14.672 --> 01:36:18.393
Great boy, this Corbett. Got a great future.
Knew it the first time l laid eyes on him.

01:36:18.543 --> 01:36:21.196
So did l. You know,
this is a great honor for San Francisco.

01:36:21.346 --> 01:36:24.165
And for the Olympic Club.
Don't forget, we picked him up.

01:36:24.315 --> 01:36:25.867
And don't forget, you threw him out.

01:36:26.017 --> 01:36:28.169
l worked on that left hook of Jim's
for years.

01:36:28.319 --> 01:36:30.638
l showed him how to bring it up inside
just like he did tonight.

01:36:30.788 --> 01:36:34.008
Did l ever tell you that Jim and l
used to work side by side in a bank?

01:36:34.158 --> 01:36:37.712
To tell you the truth, l'm the one
that talked him into being a prize fighter.

01:36:37.862 --> 01:36:40.348
He comes by his fighting
from my side of the family.

01:36:40.498 --> 01:36:43.184
The Kerry killers they used to call us
in the old country.

01:36:43.334 --> 01:36:44.619
"Look out," you could hear them yell.

01:36:44.769 --> 01:36:46.354
"Here comes the Corbetts!"

01:36:46.504 --> 01:36:48.456
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
you big bag of wind.

01:36:48.606 --> 01:36:49.791
How about us O'Douls?

01:36:49.941 --> 01:36:52.994
There never was a time
when one O'Doul couldn't handle

01:36:53.144 --> 01:36:56.497
a whole wagonload of Corbetts.
Fix your tie.

01:36:56.647 --> 01:37:01.703
Yes, darling. l'm no bag of wind.
Don't you say that.

01:37:01.853 --> 01:37:04.026
Have a drink.

01:37:08.793 --> 01:37:12.947
Just put it there.
Congratulations, Mr. Corbett.

01:37:13.097 --> 01:37:17.518
-Thank you, Miss Ware. Thank you.
-Oh, l have a present for you.

01:37:17.668 --> 01:37:19.053
-A present from you?
-Yes.

01:37:19.203 --> 01:37:23.378
For me?
lt can't be lilies, 'cause l'm still here.

01:37:30.715 --> 01:37:33.301
Well, it wouldn't take many of those
to make a dozen.

01:37:33.451 --> 01:37:35.863
How'd you guess my size?

01:38:01.479 --> 01:38:04.032
-Hello Jim.
-Hello, John L.

01:38:04.182 --> 01:38:08.202
-How are you feeling?
-All right. A little tired.

01:38:08.352 --> 01:38:09.671
Me, too.

01:38:09.821 --> 01:38:13.462
l got something
l wanted to give you, meself.

01:38:16.194 --> 01:38:20.335
l've had it a long time.
Take good care of it, will you?

01:38:31.242 --> 01:38:35.486
Thanks. Thanks, John. l will.

01:38:36.814 --> 01:38:40.802
l'll try to do it as much honor as you have.
You know something?

01:38:40.952 --> 01:38:44.490
The first time l saw you fight,
l was just a bit of a kid.

01:38:44.655 --> 01:38:47.975
There wasn't a man alive
who could have stood up to you then.

01:38:48.125 --> 01:38:51.346
And tonight, well, l was just mighty glad

01:38:51.496 --> 01:38:54.649
that you weren't the John L. Sullivan
of 10 years ago.

01:38:54.799 --> 01:38:56.751
ls that what you're thinking now?

01:38:56.901 --> 01:39:00.678
That's what l was thinking
before l even got into the ring with you.

01:39:01.172 --> 01:39:04.425
That's a fine decent thing
for you to say, Jim.

01:39:04.575 --> 01:39:07.295
l don't know
how we might have come out,

01:39:07.445 --> 01:39:09.914
say, eight or 10 years ago.

01:39:10.715 --> 01:39:12.667
Maybe l was faster then.

01:39:12.817 --> 01:39:17.595
But if l was, tonight
you're the fastest thing on two feet.

01:39:17.822 --> 01:39:20.996
Sure, it was like trying to hit a ghost.

01:39:22.226 --> 01:39:25.913
l don't know much
about this gentleman stuff

01:39:26.063 --> 01:39:28.950
they're handing out about you,

01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:34.255
but maybe you're bringing something new
to the fight game, something it needs

01:39:34.405 --> 01:39:38.478
and never got from fellas like me.
l don't know,

01:39:39.043 --> 01:39:43.583
but l do know this,
though it's tough to be a good loser,

01:39:43.748 --> 01:39:46.888
it's a lot tougher to be a good winner.

01:39:47.718 --> 01:39:49.170
Thanks again, John.

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:50.738
l hope that when my time comes,

01:39:50.888 --> 01:39:53.926
l can go out with my head
just as high as yours.

01:39:54.992 --> 01:39:58.279
There'll never be another John L. Sullivan.

01:39:58.429 --> 01:40:00.363
Thank you, Jim.

01:40:03.534 --> 01:40:06.173
-Good luck to you.
-Good luck to you.

01:41:24.615 --> 01:41:28.722
-You're thinking about Sullivan?
-Yeah.

01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:33.893
l can see him now,
walking back to his room, alone,

01:41:34.358 --> 01:41:36.531
lying there all night and thinking,

01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:40.607
"What's the use of ever getting up again?"

01:41:41.465 --> 01:41:43.171
John L.

01:41:44.502 --> 01:41:49.315
He'll never thump another bar and shout,
"l can lick any man in the world."

01:41:50.641 --> 01:41:52.882
He must be lost.

01:41:53.744 --> 01:41:56.418
You like Mr. Sullivan, don't you?

01:41:57.114 --> 01:42:01.255
-Yeah, l do.
-And he likes you.

01:42:01.519 --> 01:42:04.431
The man who pushed him off his throne.

01:42:05.022 --> 01:42:09.493
You know,
one's heart plays funny tricks sometimes.

01:42:10.995 --> 01:42:15.307
-How do you figure that out?
-Oh, a woman doesn't figure things out,

01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:18.286
she just knows all at once.

01:42:18.436 --> 01:42:22.290
l've never known a woman yet
who just doesn't know all at once.

01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:25.593
-Look, if you're so smart, tell me this.
-l'll try.

01:42:25.743 --> 01:42:29.486
-But l don't know how far l can get.
-Do you and l like each other?

01:42:30.681 --> 01:42:34.402
-Well, you like me all right and...
-Oh, l get it.

01:42:34.552 --> 01:42:36.704
l like you, but you're not sure
whether you like me, huh?

01:42:36.854 --> 01:42:40.474
l didn't say that. Now, don't talk for me,
l can do my own talking.

01:42:40.624 --> 01:42:43.177
Well, all right. Go ahead. Talk.
How do we stand?

01:42:43.327 --> 01:42:45.170
Yes, l like you.

01:42:47.031 --> 01:42:50.205
l think you like me more than l like you.

01:42:51.102 --> 01:42:53.411
But it wouldn't surprise me

01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:58.812
if l loved you more than you love me.

01:43:01.245 --> 01:43:03.384
Love? Us?

01:43:05.683 --> 01:43:07.958
And then again, l may be wrong.

01:43:08.886 --> 01:43:10.071
That's very funny.

01:43:10.221 --> 01:43:14.897
You in love with a, what was it
you called me, a shanty lrishman?

01:43:16.026 --> 01:43:18.267
Don't kid me, kiddo.

01:43:18.896 --> 01:43:22.950
And that's exactly what you are,
a tinhorn, shanty lrishman.

01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:25.620
And besides that, you can't see any further
than the end of your nose.

01:43:25.770 --> 01:43:27.521
-There you go, getting sore again.
-You tinhorn...

01:43:27.671 --> 01:43:30.658
Now wait a minute. Tinhorn, huh?

01:43:30.808 --> 01:43:33.720
Shanty lrish, huh? Come here.

01:43:35.546 --> 01:43:37.498
Well, what are you laughing at?

01:43:37.648 --> 01:43:40.219
You're gonna make a marvelous Corbett.

01:43:43.988 --> 01:43:46.707
-A fine way for a gentleman to behave.
-Oh, darling.

01:43:46.857 --> 01:43:48.309
That gentleman stuff never fooled you,
did it?

01:43:48.459 --> 01:43:52.532
-l'm no gentleman.
-ln that case, l'm no lady.

01:43:57.601 --> 01:44:01.355
Give them room ! Give them room!

01:44:01.505 --> 01:44:03.644
Give them room!

01:44:09.713 --> 01:44:14.457
The Corbetts are at it again!
The Corbetts are at it again!
