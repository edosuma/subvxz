00:08.299 --> 00:10.551
Terry, I know I haven't worked here
very long...

00:10.719 --> 00:13.470
...but I was wondering,
do you think it would be possible...

00:13.638 --> 00:16.724
...if I got a $100 advance on my salary?

00:17.267 --> 00:18.684
An advance?

00:18.852 --> 00:21.311
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving
with my family.

00:21.479 --> 00:25.774
See, every year, we go skiing in Vail,
and normally my father pays for my ticket...

00:25.942 --> 00:29.194
...but I've sort of started
this whole independent thing, you know...

00:29.362 --> 00:32.573
...which is actually why I took this "job."

00:34.159 --> 00:37.578
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.289
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.

00:41.082 --> 00:44.043
Really, really awful.

00:45.211 --> 00:48.380
Okay, I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.215
Um...

00:50.383 --> 00:54.511
But I'm trying really hard,
and I think I'm doing better.

00:54.679 --> 00:57.097
I really do.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.474
Does anybody need coffee?

00:58.641 --> 01:00.309
- Yeah, over here.
- Yeah, I do.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.897
Heh. Look at that.

01:55.740 --> 01:58.408
Excuse me, sir?
Hi. You come in here all the time.

01:58.576 --> 01:59.993
Uh-huh.
- I was just wondering...

02:00.161 --> 02:03.122
...you think there's a possibility
you could give me an advance on my tips?

02:03.289 --> 02:05.290
Huh? No.

02:05.458 --> 02:09.752
Okay, okay. That's fine, fine.
Sorry about that spill before.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.174
Only 98.50 to go.

02:14.342 --> 02:16.343
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

02:16.511 --> 02:20.222
Ross, did you know that Mom and Dad
are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?

02:20.390 --> 02:22.391
What? No, they're not.

02:22.559 --> 02:25.144
- Yes, they are. The Blymans invited them.
- You're wrong.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.189
- I am not wrong.
- You're wrong.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.359
No, I just talked to them.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.362
I'm calling Mom.

02:40.618 --> 02:41.952
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.787
- Hey.
- Coffee.

02:44.581 --> 02:48.333
And this from the Cry for Help Department:
Are you wearing makeup?

02:50.920 --> 02:51.962
Yes, I am.

02:52.130 --> 02:55.757
As of today, I am officially
Joey Tribbiani, actor/model.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.009
Thank you.

02:57.177 --> 03:02.014
That's funny, I was thinking you look more
like Joey Tribbiani, man/woman.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.184
What were you modeling for?

03:05.351 --> 03:07.561
You know those posters
for the City Free Clinic?

03:07.729 --> 03:10.439
Oh, wow. You're gonna be one of those
healthy, healthy, healthy guys?

03:10.607 --> 03:12.983
- Ah?
- The asthma guy's really cute.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.610
- Oh, he is.
- Isn't he?

03:14.777 --> 03:16.820
- You know which one you're gonna be?
- No, no.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.865
But I hear Lyme disease is open,
so, you know...

03:20.033 --> 03:22.117
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.535
Thanks.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.708
Well, you were right.
How can they do this to us, huh?

03:29.876 --> 03:31.293
It's Thanksgiving.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.129
Aw. Tell you what.
How about if I cook dinner at my place?

03:34.297 --> 03:36.340
I'll make it just like Mom's.

03:36.507 --> 03:39.426
Will you make the mashed potatoes
with the lumps?

03:40.053 --> 03:42.429
You know they're not actually
supposed to...?

03:42.597 --> 03:44.681
I'll work on the lumps.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.559
- Joey, you're going home, right?
- Yeah.

03:47.727 --> 03:51.897
And I assume, Chandler, you're still
boycotting all the Pilgrim holidays?

03:52.857 --> 03:54.942
Yes, every single one of them.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.527
Phoebe, you're gonna be
with your grandma?

03:57.695 --> 03:58.820
Yeah, and her boyfriend.

03:58.988 --> 04:02.741
But we're celebrating Thanksgiving
in December because he's lunar.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.623
So you're free Thursday, then?

04:09.791 --> 04:12.209
- Yeah. Oh, can I come?
- Yeah.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.255
Rach, you still thinking
you're gonna make it to Vail?

04:16.422 --> 04:19.132
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop.

04:19.300 --> 04:23.011
- Only $102 to go.
- I thought it was 98.50.

04:23.179 --> 04:25.847
Yeah, well, it was, but I broke a cup.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.685
Well, I'm off to Carol's.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.729
Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?

04:32.897 --> 04:34.940
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife...

04:35.108 --> 04:39.444
...and will probably wanna
bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.540
Hi. Is Carol here?

04:51.708 --> 04:55.085
- No, she's at a faculty meeting.
- Oh.

04:55.253 --> 04:58.171
Well, I just came by to pick up my skull.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.549
Well, not mine, but...

05:01.092 --> 05:02.884
- Come in.
- Thanks.

05:03.052 --> 05:07.306
Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class,
and I have to get it back to the museum.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.266
What's it look like?

05:09.434 --> 05:11.560
Kind of like a big face without skin.

05:13.313 --> 05:17.649
Yes, heh, I'm familiar with the concept.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.402
- We can just look for it.
- Okay.

05:25.533 --> 05:30.746
Wow, you guys, heh, sure have a lot
of books about being a lesbian.

05:33.207 --> 05:36.960
Well, you know,
you have to take a course.

05:38.629 --> 05:40.756
Otherwise they don't let you do it.

05:49.307 --> 05:53.185
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.104
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.443
The baby that hasn't been born yet?

06:01.611 --> 06:03.862
Uh, wouldn't that mean you're...

06:04.030 --> 06:05.697
...crazy?

06:06.449 --> 06:09.534
What, you don't think
they can hear sounds in there?

06:09.702 --> 06:13.914
You're not serious.
I mean, you really talk to it?

06:14.457 --> 06:17.876
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.046
Do you, uh...? Do you talk about me?

06:21.714 --> 06:25.133
- Yeah, yeah. All the time.
- Really?

06:25.301 --> 06:30.764
But, um, we just refer to you as
"Bobo the sperm guy."

06:41.109 --> 06:46.238
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think
I should get some belly time too.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.698
I mean, not that I believe any of this.

06:48.866 --> 06:52.494
Oh, I believe it.
I think the baby can totally hear everything.

06:52.703 --> 06:54.037
- Really?
- I can show you.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.664
This will seem a little weird.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.792
But you put your head
inside this turkey...

06:59.627 --> 07:03.171
...and then we'll all talk,
and you'll hear everything we say.

07:04.632 --> 07:07.592
I'd just like to say
I'm totally behind this experiment.

07:09.303 --> 07:11.805
In fact,
I'd very much like to butter your head.

07:16.352 --> 07:17.936
- Hey.
- Hey, Rach.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.856
- Did you make your money?
- No, not even close.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.108
Forget Vail. Forget seeing my family.

07:23.276 --> 07:27.362
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.365
Uh, Rach...

07:30.533 --> 07:31.658
...here's your mail.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.452
Thanks. You can just put it on the table.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.912
Heh. No.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.415
Here's your mail.

07:38.916 --> 07:42.752
Thanks. You can just put it on the table.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.172
Would you just open it?

07:47.425 --> 07:49.384
Oh, my God.

07:49.552 --> 07:52.804
- Oh, you guys are great.
- Aw. Ha, ha.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.056
- Aw.
- We all chipped in.

07:55.224 --> 07:58.226
- We did?
- You owe me 20 bucks.

07:58.394 --> 08:00.896
Thank you. Thank you so much.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.732
Chandler, here you go.
Got your traditional holiday feast.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.025
Got your tomato soup...

08:05.193 --> 08:09.237
...your grilled-cheese fixings,
and your family-size bag of Funyuns.

08:09.405 --> 08:12.032
Wait, this is what you're having
for Thanksgiving dinner?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.784
What is it with you and this holiday?

08:16.204 --> 08:17.496
All right, I'm 9 years old.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.331
- Aw.
- Aw, I hate this story.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.416
We've just finished Thanksgiving dinner.

08:21.584 --> 08:25.837
I have... And I remember this part vividly.
- A mouthful of pumpkin pie.

08:26.005 --> 08:30.091
And this is the moment my parents
choose to tell me they're getting divorced.

08:30.259 --> 08:31.635
Oh, my God.

08:31.802 --> 08:36.222
It's very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving
dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.658
Hi.

08:55.284 --> 08:58.119
- We used to work together.
- We did?

08:58.329 --> 09:01.122
Yeah, at Macy's.
You're the Obsession girl, right?

09:01.290 --> 09:03.708
- Yes.
- I was the Aramis guy.

09:05.878 --> 09:09.673
- Aramis? Aramis? Aramis?
- Oh.

09:09.840 --> 09:10.924
Yeah, right.

09:11.717 --> 09:14.135
I gotta tell you,
you're the best in the business.

09:14.303 --> 09:15.971
- Get out.
- I'm serious.

09:16.138 --> 09:20.559
You're amazing. You know when to spritz.
You know when to lay back.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.228
Really?
You don't know what that means to me.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.356
Mm, mm.

09:26.524 --> 09:30.151
You smell great tonight.
Uh, what are you wearing?

09:31.279 --> 09:33.071
Nothing.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.624
Listen, do you wanna go get a drink
or something?

09:45.084 --> 09:47.669
Yeah, that would be...

09:49.046 --> 09:52.007
- What's wrong?
- I just remembered I have to do something.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.967
Oh. What?

09:54.135 --> 09:55.552
Um...

09:56.554 --> 09:57.596
Leave.

09:57.763 --> 10:00.390
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.142
So I guess you all saw it.

10:45.603 --> 10:46.645
- What?
- Saw what?

10:47.229 --> 10:50.523
No, we're just laughing.
You know how laughter can be infectious.

11:09.251 --> 11:10.377
Hey.

11:10.544 --> 11:14.339
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.551
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.564
Mm, looking good. Okay.

11:31.732 --> 11:36.403
Cider's mulling, turkey's turking,
yams are yamming.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.196
What?

11:38.739 --> 11:39.781
I don't know.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.242
It's just not the same
without Mom in the kitchen.

11:42.451 --> 11:45.829
Ugh. All right, that's it.
Get out of my way and stop annoying me.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.707
Well, that's closer. That's...

11:49.250 --> 11:50.875
I got the ticket, I got the ticket.

11:51.043 --> 11:54.963
Five hours from now,
shoop, shoop, shoop.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.716
Oh, you must stop shooping.

11:57.883 --> 12:00.260
Okay, I'm gonna get my stuff.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.429
Chandler, will you just come in, already?

12:02.596 --> 12:06.307
No, thank you. I prefer to keep
a safe distance from all this merriment.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.643
Look out. Incoming pumpkin pie.

12:16.277 --> 12:20.488
Okay, we all laughed when you did it with
the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.

12:22.032 --> 12:25.660
Hey, Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any Tater Tots.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.871
That's not a question.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.790
But my mom always makes them.
It's like a tradition.

12:30.958 --> 12:34.919
You get a little piece of turkey on your fork,
a little cranberry sauce, and a Tot.

12:36.839 --> 12:40.133
I mean, it's bad enough
I can't be with my family...

12:40.301 --> 12:43.261
...because of my disease.

12:44.346 --> 12:45.638
All right, fine.

12:45.806 --> 12:48.975
Tonight's potatoes
will be both mashed with lumps...

12:49.143 --> 12:50.685
...and in the form of Tots.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.520
Yes.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.274
All right,
I'm off to talk to my unborn child.

12:57.651 --> 13:00.779
- Ah.
- Okay, Mom never hit.

13:04.825 --> 13:07.243
Okay, all done.

13:07.411 --> 13:10.580
What? Phoebe, did you whip the pota...?

13:10.748 --> 13:12.248
Ross needs lumps.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.459
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I just...

13:14.627 --> 13:19.798
I thought we could have them whipped
and then add some peas and onions.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.466
Why would we do that?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.927
Then they'd be just like
my mom used to make it...

13:24.094 --> 13:25.720
...you know, before she died.

13:28.474 --> 13:32.227
Okay, three kinds of potatoes coming up.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.730
Okay. Goodbye, you guys.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.190
Thanks for everything.

13:37.358 --> 13:41.653
Oh, God, look at... Sorry. I'm so sorry.

13:43.155 --> 13:46.741
The most unbelievable thing has happened.
Underdog has gotten away.

13:46.909 --> 13:50.537
- The balloon?
- No, no, the actual cartoon character.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.207
Of course the balloon.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.709
It's all over the news.
Before he reached Macy's...

13:56.877 --> 14:00.213
...he broke free and was spotted
flying over Washington Square Park.

14:00.381 --> 14:03.550
- I'm going to the roof. Who's with me?
- Well, I can't. I gotta go.

14:03.717 --> 14:06.052
An 80-foot inflatable dog
loose over the city?

14:06.220 --> 14:09.222
- How often does that happen?
- Almost never.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.184
- Got the keys?
- Okay.

14:17.565 --> 14:18.940
Any time you're ready.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.818
Okay.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.987
Okay, here we go.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.490
Oh...

14:28.409 --> 14:32.453
Okay, where am I talking to here?
I mean, uh...

14:32.621 --> 14:37.417
Well, there is one way that seems to offer
a certain acoustical advantage, but...

14:38.335 --> 14:39.961
Just aim for the bump.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.797
Okay.

14:43.465 --> 14:44.883
Okay, okay.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.093
Okay, here goes.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.853
You know, I... You know, I can't do this.

14:57.021 --> 15:00.106
This is... It's too weird. I feel stupid.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.901
All right, so don't do it. It's fine.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.904
You don't have to do it
just because Susan does it.

15:06.071 --> 15:10.742
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.746
- That moment when we first saw
the giant dog shadow fall over the park?

15:14.914 --> 15:18.082
But did they have to shoot him down?
I mean, that was just mean.

15:19.835 --> 15:23.421
Okay, right about now the turkey
should be crispy on the outside...

15:23.589 --> 15:25.256
...and juicy on the inside.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.718
Why are we standing here?

15:28.886 --> 15:32.263
We're waiting for you to open the door.
You've got the keys.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.182
No, I don't.

15:35.351 --> 15:39.103
Yes, you do.
When we left, you said, "Got the keys."

15:39.647 --> 15:43.983
No, I didn't. I asked, "Got the keys?"

15:44.818 --> 15:47.987
No, no, no. You said, "Got the keys."

15:48.155 --> 15:51.407
Either of you have the keys?

15:52.534 --> 15:55.286
- The oven is on.
- Oh, I've gotta get my ticket.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.539
- Wait. We have a copy of your key.
- Well, then get it, get it!

15:58.707 --> 16:01.042
Hey, hey.
That tone won't make me go any faster.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.002
- Joey.
- That one will.

16:06.757 --> 16:07.966
And everyone's telling me:

16:08.133 --> 16:11.260
"You gotta pick a major.
You gotta pick a major."

16:11.428 --> 16:16.516
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.

16:16.684 --> 16:22.063
And you have no idea what I'm saying,
because, let's face it, you're a fetus.

16:23.315 --> 16:26.442
You're just happy
you don't have gills anymore.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.405
Look, you don't have to talk to it.
You can sing to it.

16:30.572 --> 16:33.408
Oh, please.
I am not singing to your stomach, okay?

16:35.202 --> 16:36.869
- How's it going?
- Shh, shh, shh.

16:37.037 --> 16:38.913
Here we come

16:39.081 --> 16:41.374
Walkin' down the street

16:41.542 --> 16:45.253
Get the funniest looks from
Everyone we meet

16:45.421 --> 16:46.629
Hey, hey...

16:50.092 --> 16:52.844
- Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
- I did.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.513
- Well, does it always, uh...?
- No, no, that was the first.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.099
- Keep singing. Keep singing.
- Oh.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.977
Hey, hey, you're my baby

17:01.145 --> 17:03.438
And I can't wait to meet you

17:03.605 --> 17:06.941
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel
And then we'll go to the zoo

17:08.527 --> 17:10.361
I felt it that time.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.030
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy

17:12.196 --> 17:13.948
I'm the one without any breasts

17:19.329 --> 17:22.205
- Nope, not that one.
- Can you go any faster with that?

17:22.374 --> 17:24.541
Hey, I got one keyhole
and about a zillion keys.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.502
You do the math.

17:26.670 --> 17:29.714
Why do you guys have so many keys
in there anyway?

17:29.882 --> 17:32.592
For an emergency just like this.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.220
All right, listen, smirky.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.473
If it wasn't for your stupid balloon...

17:38.640 --> 17:41.809
...I would be on a plane,
watching a woman do this right now.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.978
But I'm not.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.315
I swear you said you had the keys.

17:47.483 --> 17:50.151
No. I wouldn't say I had the keys
unless I had the keys.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.111
And I obviously did not have the keys.

17:52.279 --> 17:56.032
Okay, all right, that's it.
Enough with the keys. No one say "keys."

17:58.285 --> 18:01.162
Why would I have the keys?

18:01.330 --> 18:03.331
Aside from the fact
that you said you did?

18:03.499 --> 18:05.833
- But I didn't.
- Well, you should have.

18:06.001 --> 18:07.335
- Why?
- Because.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.545
Why? Because everything
is my responsibility?

18:09.713 --> 18:12.340
Isn't it enough
that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner?

18:12.508 --> 18:16.677
Everyone wants a different kind of potato,
so I'm making different kinds of potatoes.

18:16.845 --> 18:19.847
You know, does anybody care
what kind of potatoes I want?

18:20.015 --> 18:23.643
No, no, no!

18:23.811 --> 18:26.854
You know, just as long as Phoebe
gets her peas and onions...

18:27.022 --> 18:28.981
...and Mario gets his Tots.

18:29.191 --> 18:33.027
It's my first Thanksgiving, and I...

18:33.195 --> 18:36.614
It's all burnt, and I can't...

18:38.283 --> 18:40.743
Okay, Monica,
only dogs can hear you now, so...

18:40.911 --> 18:42.662
Look, the door's open. Here we go.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.288
Oh, God.

18:45.082 --> 18:46.707
- Ooh.
- Oh.

18:48.836 --> 18:52.004
Well, the turkey's burnt.

18:52.172 --> 18:56.676
Potatoes are ruined.
Potatoes are ruined. Potatoes are ruined.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.261
Here we come

18:58.470 --> 18:59.512
Walkin' down the...

19:03.016 --> 19:05.685
This doesn't smell like Mom's.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.814
No, it doesn't, does it?
But you wanted lumps, Ross?

19:09.982 --> 19:12.275
Well, here you go, buddy. You got one.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.112
Oh, God, this is great.

19:16.321 --> 19:19.699
The plane is gone,
so I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.

19:19.867 --> 19:23.619
Hey, we all had better plans, okay?
This was nobody's first choice.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.204
Oh, really?

19:25.372 --> 19:26.914
So why was I busting my ass...

19:27.082 --> 19:29.417
...to make this delicious
Thanksgiving dinner?!

19:29.585 --> 19:32.044
- You call that delicious?
- You be quiet!

19:34.256 --> 19:36.007
All right, stop it, stop it, stop it!

19:36.800 --> 19:39.010
Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.401
- Ew.
- What?

19:55.569 --> 19:59.071
Ugly Naked Guy's
taking his turkey out of the oven.

20:00.490 --> 20:01.782
JOEY, ROSS & MONICA:
Eh.

20:01.950 --> 20:04.869
Oh, my God. He's not alone.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.245
Ugly Naked Guy...

20:06.413 --> 20:09.582
...is having Thanksgiving dinner
with Ugly Naked Gal.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.461
I gotta see this.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.172
Aw.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.382
All right, Ugly Naked Guy.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.969
Ooh, ugly naked dancing.

20:22.137 --> 20:24.680
It's nice that he has someone.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.526
Shall I carve?

20:37.694 --> 20:38.778
By all means.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.947
All right.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.579
Okay, who wants light cheese
and who wants dark cheese?

20:49.081 --> 20:52.500
I don't even wanna know
about the dark cheese.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.294
- Does anybody wanna split this with me?
- Ooh, I will.

20:55.462 --> 20:56.921
Mm. You guys have to make a wish.

20:57.923 --> 21:01.926
- Make a wish?
- Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

21:05.847 --> 21:09.433
Ooh. You got the bigger half.
What did you wish for?

21:09.601 --> 21:11.602
The bigger half.

21:13.563 --> 21:16.148
All right, I'd like to propose a toast.

21:16.316 --> 21:18.776
- A little toast here. Ding, ding, ding.
- Mm.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.904
This isn't exactly
the kind of Thanksgiving you planned...

21:22.072 --> 21:25.866
...but for me this has been really great,
you know?

21:26.034 --> 21:28.786
I think because it didn't involve divorce...

21:28.954 --> 21:30.788
...or projectile vomiting.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.793
I was just thinking,
if you'd gone to Vail...

21:35.961 --> 21:39.880
...or if you guys had been with your family,
or if you didn't have...

21:40.048 --> 21:41.590
...syphilis and stuff...

21:44.219 --> 21:46.137
...we wouldn't be all together, you know?

21:46.305 --> 21:47.972
So I guess what I'm trying to say...

21:48.140 --> 21:54.020
...is that I'm very thankful
that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.480
That's so sweet.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.649
Thank you.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.318
Mm.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.611
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.071
And a crappy New Year.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.532
Hear, hear.
