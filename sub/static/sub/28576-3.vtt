00:00.125 --> 00:01.773
Previously, on Harrow...

00:01.809 --> 00:03.438
I can't stay here anymore.
They think I did it.

00:03.462 --> 00:04.467
What? Why?

00:04.503 --> 00:05.970
Because you've got a criminal record.

00:05.994 --> 00:07.211
If the cops see you together,

00:07.247 --> 00:09.199
she'll be arrested for breaching
her bail conditions.

00:09.223 --> 00:10.148
She didn't do it.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.399
I don't think it's going to
matter, mate.

00:11.423 --> 00:13.304
Unless you can prove someone else did.

00:13.340 --> 00:14.917
She was working as a cleaner
at the chemist

00:14.941 --> 00:16.001
where the fentanyl was stolen from.

00:16.024 --> 00:17.510
She knew where the drugs were kept.

00:17.840 --> 00:18.973
Are you OK?

00:19.009 --> 00:21.694
- The shooting, now this.
- All part of a day's work.

00:21.876 --> 00:25.641
I didn't know she was working here,
or that she was Patty's niece.

00:25.677 --> 00:28.162
There was a string of murders,
all linked to him.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.845
Did you like my beautiful
blood-red roses?

00:30.880 --> 00:32.165
Francis Chester.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.300
He was the man who shot me.

00:33.336 --> 00:35.701
I put him away for these murders
15 years ago

00:35.737 --> 00:37.074
and now he wants to get his own back.

00:37.098 --> 00:38.623
It can't have been Francis Chester.

00:39.034 --> 00:42.205
He died in a prison fire six months ago.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.790
- I thought you would drive a...
- What?

02:29.654 --> 02:32.634
Go on, Dr Harrow, do tell me
how you've pigeonholed me.

02:33.336 --> 02:36.787
Well, top neurosurgeon,
I would have expected a...

02:37.485 --> 02:38.485
Cliche?

02:39.438 --> 02:40.503
Touche.

02:41.058 --> 02:43.565
Regarding cliches, I suppose
it's true what they say

02:43.600 --> 02:45.090
about the size of a man's car?

02:45.698 --> 02:47.205
It's inversely proportional, right?

02:47.240 --> 02:48.362
You're telling the story.

02:49.630 --> 02:51.035
It's quite a small car.

02:51.086 --> 02:52.211
Er, medium.

02:52.247 --> 02:53.745
And you're a doctor too.

02:53.956 --> 02:56.496
You could afford something that
doesn't look ready to implode.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.789
What's the real reason?

02:59.400 --> 03:02.965
It was my dad's.
He was an army surgeon in Vietnam.

03:04.001 --> 03:06.085
When he came back,
he didn't love a lot of things

03:06.120 --> 03:07.791
but he loved that car.

03:07.894 --> 03:09.037
Is he still around?

03:09.640 --> 03:11.560
- Yours?
- I wouldn't know.

03:13.238 --> 03:17.399
_

03:24.515 --> 03:26.197
Hi, Port Astor morgue.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.618
Sorry for the wait.

03:27.654 --> 03:30.059
You're after that autopsy report, right?

03:30.095 --> 03:36.035
Yes. Francis Chester, died in
a prison fire about six months ago.

03:36.294 --> 03:38.728
Is Dr Laurie Badcoe available?

03:38.764 --> 03:40.404
I'll just check, one moment.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.925
Well that explains why you're not
answering your phone.

03:42.960 --> 03:46.565
Well, changing phone plans.

03:46.600 --> 03:47.979
I'm trying to be a grown-up.

03:48.245 --> 03:49.525
I left you a voicemail.

03:50.605 --> 03:51.690
About?

03:51.960 --> 03:55.720
Honestly? Carrier pigeons would be
more effective. An urgent PM.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.740
Why are you here if
you've left a voicemail?

04:00.568 --> 04:01.908
Francis Chester.

04:03.679 --> 04:04.844
I'm...

04:04.880 --> 04:07.285
I'm just a bit worried
that you might be dwelling

04:07.320 --> 04:08.801
on our conversation the other day.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.187
Not at all.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.285
I'm alive. Chester's dead.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.885
Skene shot me, Skene's dead.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.600
I'm on hold, I wish I was dead.
Life goes on.

04:19.591 --> 04:21.353
So you're sure you're OK.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.400
I promise.

04:24.095 --> 04:26.205
Alright. Voicemail.

04:26.615 --> 04:28.096
Hello, Dr Harrow?

04:29.006 --> 04:30.663
Hi. Yes, I'm still here.

04:32.140 --> 04:34.643
I'm sorry, Dr Badcoe is out right now.

04:35.117 --> 04:37.397
But I can send you the autopsy report.

04:37.920 --> 04:40.659
Yes, please. Everything you've got.

04:44.640 --> 04:47.085
Looks like someone bricked up
the asbestos sheeting,

04:47.120 --> 04:48.335
shoved her in as well.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.496
The owner of the house?

04:49.613 --> 04:52.491
It's changed hands a few times.
They're putting together a list.

04:53.466 --> 04:56.285
She looks as if she's been there
at least ten years.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.522
More like 20, judging from those shoes.

04:58.818 --> 05:00.805
You're a shoe expert?

05:00.840 --> 05:05.120
Don't judge me,
Mr Denim Catalogue Pirate.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.180
You do wear a lot of denim.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.685
- She would have had a purse.
- Yeah.

05:12.721 --> 05:14.641
But unfortunately no ID.

05:14.920 --> 05:18.297
Whoever put her in there probably
ditched it but we did find this.

05:21.460 --> 05:22.620
Ecstasy.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.325
Perhaps.

05:25.361 --> 05:28.165
We'll be unlikely to find any trace
in her organs after this long.

05:28.598 --> 05:30.093
Do we really need all this?

05:30.277 --> 05:33.661
There wouldn't be much fibre dust
left on her clothes, would there?

05:34.163 --> 05:36.848
Some people can be exposed
to the particles for years

05:36.884 --> 05:37.966
and not be affected.

05:38.001 --> 05:41.005
Others can inhale just a few fibres
and get lung cancer.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.335
Better safe than sorry.

05:42.371 --> 05:44.057
Those builders would have done the same

05:44.093 --> 05:45.693
if they'd known about the asbestos.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.500
You're not coming in?

05:53.640 --> 05:55.160
White's not my colour.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.405
Blood?

06:15.440 --> 06:16.765
Could be.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.040
Do those tears correspond
with those cuts?

06:20.280 --> 06:21.725
A knife.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.800
They're too rough and irregular.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.605
I wore a top like this
to my cousin's 18th.

06:27.640 --> 06:30.000
It didn't really go with
the three-quarter pants.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.285
Do you really remember that?

06:32.320 --> 06:35.120
You must know what you wore
to significant events in your life.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.205
I don't remember what I wore yesterday.

06:38.240 --> 06:39.485
Same as today.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.045
Same as every day.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.485
When you lot have finished
discussing your fashion choices,

06:43.520 --> 06:45.760
can I have my evidence bags please?

07:15.440 --> 07:16.760
Just hanging out?

07:26.000 --> 07:26.966
Dad believes you.

07:27.001 --> 07:28.965
Yeah!

07:29.000 --> 07:31.040
- Mum doesn't.
- I know.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.925
Cal.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.680
When I asked you about the rent money...

07:40.960 --> 07:42.560
you said it was sorted.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.445
You said trust me.

07:45.480 --> 07:47.405
Yeah, because I got a job.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.445
Bullshit.

07:49.480 --> 07:52.360
You know that Italian restaurant
two streets from our flat?

07:53.800 --> 07:57.760
Well, I am their new apprentice.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.685
The pay's shit and the hours are shitty

08:00.720 --> 08:03.440
and I still got to do TAFE
two days a week but...

08:06.880 --> 08:09.960
I didn't want to say anything 'cause
I wanted to keep it a surprise.

08:11.960 --> 08:13.680
Treat you to a...

08:19.720 --> 08:20.720
Wait.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.965
We're not supposed to see each other.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.320
Stuff 'em.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.485
Start with the local dentists.

08:49.520 --> 08:53.405
No fillings, no dental work.
She may not even be on file.

08:53.540 --> 08:54.680
What's that?

08:57.117 --> 08:59.562
- Paint.
- Take a sample.

08:59.598 --> 09:00.598
Sure thing.

09:01.969 --> 09:03.485
No defensive wounds,

09:03.520 --> 09:08.436
finger nails intact, no sign of
skin or hair under the nails.

09:08.472 --> 09:10.637
No obvious trauma to the genital area

09:10.673 --> 09:13.033
and the clothing didn't appear
to have been interfered with.

09:14.717 --> 09:16.965
How come she never makes
fun of your clothes?

09:17.000 --> 09:20.205
Because Simon dresses like someone
who walks past the specials bin

09:20.240 --> 09:21.600
into the actual shop.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.331
This knee looks hyper-rotated.

09:28.730 --> 09:30.027
The CT is up.

09:31.173 --> 09:36.275
Yes, you're right about that knee
and that shoulder is dislocated.

09:36.311 --> 09:39.424
All consistent with being manhandled
into that small space.

09:39.460 --> 09:40.645
Jaw intact.

09:40.925 --> 09:42.205
No skull fractures.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.645
No damage to the hyoid bone

09:43.680 --> 09:46.412
and her cervical vertebrae
are all intact.

09:46.691 --> 09:49.611
No bruising on the neck,
so not strangled.

09:52.019 --> 09:55.323
Those ribs are fractured,
so was her sternum.

09:56.071 --> 09:58.965
Symmetrical bilateral
and anterior fractures.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.604
The fact that they're symmetrical,
they're more consistent with...

10:02.640 --> 10:03.660
CPR.

10:05.627 --> 10:08.007
Well, I've done it myself
on the operating table.

10:10.266 --> 10:12.391
Maybe someone wasn't trying to kill her,

10:12.427 --> 10:15.108
maybe someone was trying to save her.

10:20.960 --> 10:24.040
There are no free red blood cells
in any of the rib section.

10:24.076 --> 10:26.721
So her circulation had stopped
when her ribs were broken.

10:26.757 --> 10:28.162
She was dead already.

10:28.204 --> 10:30.902
Someone tried to revive her
but they were too late.

10:31.242 --> 10:33.084
This blue material is paint.

10:33.385 --> 10:35.493
I've never seen anything like it though.

10:36.554 --> 10:38.399
Those are metal oxides.

10:38.435 --> 10:40.393
You get them in pearlescent house paint.

10:41.162 --> 10:44.487
So it looks like she put her head
back into wet paint.

10:44.523 --> 10:46.616
Was there anything that colour
in the crime scene photos?

10:46.640 --> 10:47.680
No.

10:49.874 --> 10:50.919
Wait.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.520
May I?

11:03.400 --> 11:05.931
That is not hers.

11:06.740 --> 11:08.145
The person who killed her.

11:08.181 --> 11:09.466
Or tried to save her.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.964
Or bricked her up in that wall.

11:13.226 --> 11:14.746
Shit!

11:26.133 --> 11:27.698
Sorry, sorry.

11:27.734 --> 11:30.205
No problem. I've just been
explaining to your daughter

11:30.240 --> 11:32.456
that the police don't have to prove
that she stole the drugs

11:32.480 --> 11:33.485
from the chemist.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.070
The pharmaceuticals were
found inside her flat.

11:36.841 --> 11:39.645
Legally, that means that they're hers.

11:39.680 --> 11:43.285
So the possession charge is a slam dunk.

11:43.672 --> 11:45.760
So what would the sentence be.

11:48.160 --> 11:49.600
Is it jail?

11:50.593 --> 11:52.398
I spoke to a prosecutor,
a friend of mine,

11:52.434 --> 11:54.914
and apparently, we're looking at...

11:55.648 --> 11:56.860
seven.

11:57.519 --> 11:58.839
Seven months?

12:01.033 --> 12:02.513
Seven years?

12:06.932 --> 12:07.932
I didn't do it.

12:07.966 --> 12:09.621
Why aren't the cops looking
for the person who did?

12:09.645 --> 12:12.269
Because as far as they're concerned,
there is no one else. You're it.

12:12.293 --> 12:14.056
So I'm going to jail for something
I didn't do?

12:14.080 --> 12:16.216
- I think we all know who did do it.
- It wasn't Callan.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.000
Come on, Fern.

12:18.957 --> 12:22.282
I know that you're trying to protect
him but you're facing jail here.

12:22.318 --> 12:24.485
You couldn't hack three months
at boarding school.

12:24.520 --> 12:26.325
Well, Dad believes him

12:26.360 --> 12:28.440
and that's why he's letting
Callan stay on the Betty.

12:31.736 --> 12:33.659
And how do you know where Callan is?

12:35.325 --> 12:36.946
Jesus Christ.

12:37.306 --> 12:40.605
If you get caught together,
you will be arrested on the spot.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.045
You need to stay away from him.

12:42.080 --> 12:45.140
No, what I need is for
someone to believe us.

12:45.176 --> 12:47.578
I won't be pleading guilty
to something I didn't do.

12:47.875 --> 12:49.445
Fern! Fern!

12:49.480 --> 12:52.120
So he's on your boat?

12:53.037 --> 12:54.882
How did you think that
was going to play out?

12:54.979 --> 12:58.099
- I don't think he stole those drugs.
- Right. Who did?

13:05.880 --> 13:07.998
So what happens if we take it to trial?

13:08.100 --> 13:10.058
- Your solicitor advised that?
- No.

13:10.094 --> 13:12.576
He wants us to make some
kind of plea arrangement.

13:12.612 --> 13:14.097
Well, that would be my advice.

13:14.133 --> 13:16.583
You know, an early guilty plea
will work in your favour.

13:17.141 --> 13:20.925
In fact, the first offense, good family,

13:20.960 --> 13:24.778
good work record, you could get them
down to two years, maybe 18 months.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.375
It's still jail.

13:26.520 --> 13:29.165
It's still possession of fentanyl.

13:29.200 --> 13:32.640
- Dan, it's the enemy drug du jour.
- But she didn't steal it, Paul.

13:33.325 --> 13:35.862
How would she have broken into
the chemist's drug cabinet?

13:35.898 --> 13:38.362
She didn't have a key for that.
And what about the security footage?

13:38.386 --> 13:39.519
Why aren't the police looking into that?

13:39.543 --> 13:41.765
Because they don't need to, OK?

13:41.800 --> 13:44.926
They found the stolen drugs
on your daughter.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.245
Now, right or wrong,
the law says that they're hers.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.362
The police aren't going
to look for anyone else.

13:52.068 --> 13:55.559
Unless you can find someone else to
admit that they put the drugs there,

13:56.480 --> 13:57.960
your girl's gonna go to jail.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.210
I'm sorry, Dan.

14:14.780 --> 14:17.345
- What's this?
- Missing person photos.

14:17.443 --> 14:19.128
Mid '90s to early 2000s.

14:21.029 --> 14:23.869
Too short. Too tall.

14:24.877 --> 14:26.006
Not Caucasian.

14:26.041 --> 14:27.160
Harrow...

14:28.147 --> 14:29.989
Grace has already found our girl.

14:31.015 --> 14:32.445
Elizabeth Hewitt.

14:32.562 --> 14:36.405
She's the right match for height,
age, ethnicity, hair colour

14:36.440 --> 14:37.440
and earrings.

14:37.471 --> 14:40.476
She was a uni student,
reported missing April 1997.

14:40.512 --> 14:43.554
- By her parents?
- No, they died when she was 12.

14:43.971 --> 14:46.468
- So who reported her missing?
- Her best friend.

14:47.531 --> 14:48.771
Melissa Turner.

14:50.522 --> 14:51.746
She's dead?

14:55.492 --> 14:56.757
Where did you find her?

14:58.014 --> 14:59.655
It was a house in Annerley.

14:59.813 --> 15:02.013
She was found bricked up behind a wall.

15:04.042 --> 15:05.238
Do you recognize her?

15:07.685 --> 15:08.797
How did she die?

15:09.293 --> 15:11.018
We don't know yet.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.845
- I got to get my bag.
- I said outside please.

15:13.980 --> 15:14.980
Sure.

15:19.120 --> 15:23.525
Ms Turner, you shared a room
on campus and, as far as we know,

15:23.560 --> 15:24.976
you're the last person to see her alive

15:25.000 --> 15:26.885
on the night of Saturday
the 12th of April.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.725
Now, is there anything you can tell us?

15:29.760 --> 15:32.160
Where she was going?
What you two were doing?

15:33.051 --> 15:34.251
Nothing.

15:36.099 --> 15:37.459
We were watching videos.

15:38.920 --> 15:41.040
And the next day, the Sunday?

15:42.207 --> 15:43.340
Er...

15:43.496 --> 15:47.195
Sunday morning her door was shut,
I thought she was asleep.

15:48.298 --> 15:49.383
I had classes.

15:49.419 --> 15:53.354
My cleaning job was Monday or Tuesday.

15:54.190 --> 15:56.210
I realised I hadn't seen her
since the weekend...

15:57.960 --> 15:59.331
and her room was empty.

16:01.480 --> 16:02.880
That's when I reported her missing.

16:04.960 --> 16:09.293
Alright. Well, if there's
anything else you think of...

16:09.548 --> 16:11.788
Watching videos on a Saturday night?

16:13.382 --> 16:15.265
It's party night on campus, right?

16:16.720 --> 16:19.920
Libby was found dressed to go out.

16:23.182 --> 16:25.382
Last time I saw her
she was wearing pjamas.

16:27.280 --> 16:31.120
Right, OK. Thanks very much,
Ms Turner, we'll be in touch.

16:41.231 --> 16:43.536
I know you have a lot of skills,
Dr Molyneux.

16:43.809 --> 16:45.765
But let me respectfully say something

16:45.800 --> 16:48.074
that I've said to your supervisor
quite a few times,

16:48.440 --> 16:51.165
leave the police
to ask police questions.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.030
If they do, I will.

16:56.545 --> 16:58.279
You think that woman was lying?

16:58.315 --> 17:01.525
You saw her face.
She recognized Libby's clothes.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.270
They meant something to her.

17:03.306 --> 17:07.119
She did seem genuinely surprised
when she heard her friend was dead.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.556
I don't think she knew.

17:11.085 --> 17:12.328
So what's she hiding?

17:12.849 --> 17:15.251
Maybe it's Melissa's hair
we found on the remains.

17:17.428 --> 17:19.709
Let's find out. DNA is back.

17:22.520 --> 17:25.685
The hair we found on Libby's body
is an exact match with

17:26.233 --> 17:29.580
an unknown male, who sexually
assaulted two university students

17:29.616 --> 17:30.955
in 1998.

17:31.135 --> 17:33.175
Both young women
were attacked on campus.

17:33.211 --> 17:34.548
No one was ever charged.

17:35.450 --> 17:38.422
That was a year after
Libby went missing.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.848
We didn't find evidence
that she was sexually assaulted.

17:42.352 --> 17:45.997
Maybe he was unable to,
lost his temper, smothered her.

17:46.033 --> 17:47.318
But tried to revive her?

17:47.354 --> 17:49.679
Failed, hid away his crime?

17:50.119 --> 17:51.644
It's not adding up, is it?

17:51.711 --> 17:54.494
The police have found the man
who owned the house.

17:56.077 --> 17:57.927
I don't know who put her there,
I didn't,

17:58.440 --> 17:59.645
And I didn't rape anyone.

17:59.680 --> 18:03.045
You were working in maintenance
at the uni, at that time.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.165
So?

18:04.200 --> 18:06.325
Where two women were sexually assaulted.

18:06.360 --> 18:07.620
Not by me.

18:07.922 --> 18:09.656
And you own the house
where the body was found.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.245
I had no idea she was there.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.965
What, you're telling me that someone
snuck under your house,

18:14.000 --> 18:15.605
hid a woman's body, then bricked her up,

18:15.640 --> 18:17.245
all without you having a clue?

18:17.760 --> 18:19.000
Well, they must have done.

18:22.078 --> 18:25.163
Look, yes, I was bringing up
the asbestos

18:25.440 --> 18:28.045
but I didn't rape anyone,
I didn't kill anyone.

18:28.480 --> 18:31.132
And I sure didn't hide any
dead girls under my house.

18:31.348 --> 18:34.148
Fair enough. You won't mind
giving us a DNA sample then?

18:36.481 --> 18:38.213
I do mind actually.

18:39.282 --> 18:42.082
I don't know what you blokes will do
with it mucking around in the lab.

18:42.385 --> 18:43.385
No.

18:44.884 --> 18:45.924
You can go jump.

18:50.840 --> 18:53.365
Excuse me, Mr Evans. I am sorry.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.044
Big fan of home maintenance.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.245
How many times have you performed CPR?

18:58.547 --> 19:01.696
- You know what CPR is, right?
- Yeah, the breath and chest thing.

19:01.732 --> 19:04.577
Why? I've never done that.
What's that got to do with anything?

19:04.613 --> 19:06.939
Harrow! Harrow,
what the bloody hell are you doing?

19:07.800 --> 19:10.795
Someone tried to resuscitate
Libby Hewitt

19:10.831 --> 19:12.902
but that man barely knew
what I was talking about.

19:13.501 --> 19:15.295
Maybe that's why it didn't work.

19:15.331 --> 19:17.646
Look, maybe he assaulted
those other girls

19:17.682 --> 19:19.059
but I don't think he
put Libby in the wall.

19:19.083 --> 19:20.088
Look...

19:20.791 --> 19:21.996
Evans worked at the uni.

19:22.032 --> 19:24.005
He owned the house
where the body was found.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.803
He's copped to the brickwork
and he refused to give his DNA.

19:26.839 --> 19:29.080
I just think it's a bit too easy.

19:31.599 --> 19:34.011
What, you come out of the same
bloody cupboard as him, did you?

19:34.035 --> 19:35.677
- I think maybe...
- I think,

19:35.713 --> 19:38.666
once we get a court order compelling
Ron there to give us a DNA sample,

19:38.702 --> 19:40.392
you'll both be buying me a drink.

19:41.611 --> 19:43.731
Have you found out cause of death yet?

19:44.682 --> 19:46.628
Well, how about you run off
and do your job,

19:46.664 --> 19:48.420
stop telling me how to do mine?

19:49.394 --> 19:50.914
Top shelf, that drink.

19:54.539 --> 19:56.151
I think he likes you.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.222
So now what?

19:59.343 --> 20:01.624
There's nothing more we can do
to find out cause of death.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.525
So we just wait for Ron's DNA
on the off-chance he's the guy,

20:04.560 --> 20:06.065
which we both know he's not?

20:06.796 --> 20:08.869
It's one of the worst parts of this job.

20:10.486 --> 20:12.254
Wanting something and...

20:13.320 --> 20:14.700
not being able to have it.

20:16.600 --> 20:19.037
Yes. The perils of the job.

20:29.565 --> 20:31.074
Heard they got the guy.

20:31.800 --> 20:34.645
We'll see when the court
compels him to give his DNA.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.057
You're not sure?

20:36.168 --> 20:37.728
I'm not sure I'm not sure.

20:40.891 --> 20:42.660
- Memo.
- Boring.

20:42.696 --> 20:44.285
- Memo.
- Boring.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.078
- A court appearance.
- Fine.

20:46.114 --> 20:48.239
Invitation to speak.

20:48.360 --> 20:49.845
Annual Report.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.045
Boring.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.154
Ooh...

20:52.784 --> 20:53.864
What?

20:55.400 --> 20:57.005
Couriered from Port Astor morgue.

20:58.520 --> 21:01.680
One of your former supervisors
is based there.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.845
You requested this personally.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.918
What's this about?

21:08.920 --> 21:11.202
Whatever it is, maybe I can help.

21:12.293 --> 21:13.614
I've helped before.

21:18.622 --> 21:20.130
Shut the door.

21:25.562 --> 21:26.925
- 18 months?
- Yeah.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.976
And that's if I plead guilty,
otherwise it's longer.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.457
But you can't go to jail
for something you didn't do.

21:30.481 --> 21:32.085
That doesn't really seem to matter.

21:32.345 --> 21:35.110
It's like I'm in this big machine
and everything's running over me.

21:35.146 --> 21:38.245
- They weren't our drugs, Fish.
- No one seems to care about that.

21:38.280 --> 21:39.564
They're not even looking
for anyone else.

21:39.588 --> 21:40.588
So then what do we do?

21:40.624 --> 21:42.207
We have to do what the cops
should be doing,

21:42.231 --> 21:44.471
we've got to find out who actually
put those drugs there.

21:45.160 --> 21:46.485
- OK.
- Cal, what are you doing?

21:46.520 --> 21:47.736
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

21:47.760 --> 21:48.792
You've got a job, babe.

21:48.828 --> 21:50.776
Fish, I'm not going to let you
do this by yourself.

21:50.800 --> 21:53.845
Cal, you have to because if you
don't and we get caught together

21:53.880 --> 21:55.532
- I'm gone anyway.
- Fish.

21:55.568 --> 21:58.404
- Cal, let me go. It's OK.
- Well, what are you going to do?

21:58.451 --> 22:01.051
I'm gonna find out who stole
those drugs from the chemist, OK?

22:06.725 --> 22:08.285
Can you be careful, please?

22:12.280 --> 22:13.582
So why this guy?

22:14.196 --> 22:16.241
Chester of all people, why him?

22:16.992 --> 22:21.301
Nearly 20 years ago, Francis Chester
was principal suspect

22:21.337 --> 22:26.524
in multiple killings of couples
but a very, very smart man.

22:26.704 --> 22:29.325
The police knew he'd done it,
we knew he'd done it,

22:29.360 --> 22:30.720
Maxine, Jack and I.

22:32.120 --> 22:36.285
It was the end of the final day
of prosecution evidence.

22:36.320 --> 22:40.447
Jack was on the stand but we had
nothing solid to convict Chester,

22:40.920 --> 22:43.685
so it looked like he might be acquitted.

22:43.878 --> 22:48.135
Maxine and I had been working
three days straight to find anything

22:48.565 --> 22:49.610
and we did.

22:50.231 --> 22:52.304
At the last minute we found it.

22:53.320 --> 22:55.725
- What?
- A tiny piece of evidence

22:55.760 --> 22:58.834
that put Chester at every murder
he'd committed.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.445
So I rushed it to court,
had it entered and...

23:05.602 --> 23:09.887
And I remember Chester's face
when he realized we had him,

23:09.923 --> 23:12.083
that he was going to jail
for the rest of his life.

23:13.820 --> 23:16.740
The way he looked at me
with such hatred.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.040
So if anyone wanted revenge...

23:23.080 --> 23:24.800
it'd be Francis Chester.

23:26.820 --> 23:28.340
Only he's dead.

23:31.680 --> 23:36.480
The one tiny flaw
in my otherwise excellent theory.

23:37.600 --> 23:41.640
No, we have better things to do...

23:42.760 --> 23:44.400
than chase ghosts.

23:46.317 --> 23:49.903
I still have to establish
cause of death for Libby Hewitt.

23:49.973 --> 23:51.717
I'll be pulling an all-nighter too.

23:53.011 --> 23:54.536
Anatomical path exam.

23:54.572 --> 23:56.450
Good luck.

23:56.642 --> 24:00.156
And don't forget
the prostatic biopsies.

24:00.192 --> 24:02.192
They always trick you with a prostate.

27:06.824 --> 27:07.948
Lyle.

27:08.182 --> 27:09.354
Present.

27:10.071 --> 27:11.596
- Have you seen Simon?
- No.

27:11.865 --> 27:13.073
Can I help?

27:13.574 --> 27:16.499
He showed us some DNA of some
historical rape kits.

27:16.535 --> 27:17.700
Are they kept here?

27:17.736 --> 27:19.594
In the evidence archive room.

27:19.948 --> 27:22.788
Any pathology results to do
with a police investigation.

27:27.240 --> 27:30.605
What if a sexual assault
was initially reported

27:30.640 --> 27:32.965
but the victim didn't want to pursue it?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.805
Well, depends how far
down the track they got.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.130
If DNA was tested,
it might still be on file.

27:38.285 --> 27:39.322
Thanks.

27:40.091 --> 27:42.891
Is this to do with a PM
under Dr Harrow's supervision?

27:43.821 --> 27:44.851
Sort of.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.164
Right.

28:11.708 --> 28:14.362
_

28:20.080 --> 28:22.916
Did you know Ron was hiding asbestos?

28:22.952 --> 28:25.730
Almost every house in the street
had asbestos in it.

28:26.196 --> 28:28.396
We'd get quotes to get it removed.

28:29.280 --> 28:30.789
Cost a bloody fortune.

28:31.459 --> 28:32.993
And Ron didn't want to?

28:33.539 --> 28:36.179
Ron throw money around
like a man with no hands.

28:37.162 --> 28:38.927
So he bricked over it.

28:38.963 --> 28:40.122
Yep.

28:40.733 --> 28:42.933
And that poor girl, apparently.

28:44.775 --> 28:46.895
Of course Ron didn't brick it up
himself.

28:48.805 --> 28:50.965
Ron was the laziest bastard I ever met.

28:53.288 --> 28:54.688
So who did the work?

29:01.260 --> 29:02.385
There you are.

29:03.262 --> 29:05.867
Here I am. What are you up to?

29:05.903 --> 29:09.388
Ron Evans's neighbour said that Ron
had a young university student

29:09.424 --> 29:10.709
doing the brick work.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.160
Have you told Nichols?

29:12.839 --> 29:15.284
Well, I thought I'd tell you first.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.505
What are you up to?

29:18.076 --> 29:20.601
There was no evidence of
sexual assault on Libby's body

29:20.723 --> 29:24.097
but that hair we found is bugging me.

29:24.184 --> 29:26.645
I wanted to see if Libby filed a report

29:26.680 --> 29:28.325
that could link to Evans but...

29:28.360 --> 29:30.746
But there's no rape kit for Libby.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.832
And something else.

29:33.503 --> 29:35.527
I can't get over her clothes.

29:35.942 --> 29:38.845
Libby wasn't dressed up to watch
a video, she went somewhere.

29:38.880 --> 29:41.811
So why would Melissa lie
about what happened that night?

29:43.891 --> 29:45.931
Maybe it wasn't Libby that was raped.

29:46.791 --> 29:48.191
Maybe it was Melissa.

30:05.709 --> 30:07.744
_

30:10.613 --> 30:12.773
I've never even told my husband
this before.

30:14.486 --> 30:16.780
You don't have to tell us
if you don't want to.

30:19.148 --> 30:23.108
But whatever happened to you,
it might explain how Libby died.

30:26.465 --> 30:27.705
That Saturday night...

30:28.995 --> 30:30.835
we all went to a party off canvas.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.435
Ready? Come on!

30:38.533 --> 30:39.973
We were just trying to fit in.

30:40.967 --> 30:42.146
Be cool.

30:44.794 --> 30:46.052
We were all drinking.

30:47.690 --> 30:51.930
Then the birthday boy,
he handed out these tablets.

31:00.457 --> 31:01.655
Ecstasy.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.139
At that moment...

31:16.197 --> 31:17.917
I've never felt so special.

31:20.955 --> 31:22.391
And I'd never been...

31:22.965 --> 31:24.125
envied before.

31:28.252 --> 31:29.452
Where was Libby?

31:31.229 --> 31:32.309
She was drinking.

31:38.920 --> 31:40.800
The boy and I ended up in a bedroom.

31:46.068 --> 31:47.529
I liked it at first.

31:49.314 --> 31:50.594
I wanted it at first.

31:55.322 --> 31:56.882
Then I asked him to slow it down.

31:58.480 --> 31:59.520
To stop.

32:05.500 --> 32:06.620
He didn't.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.240
He raped you?

32:19.039 --> 32:20.159
I mean...

32:21.676 --> 32:23.036
I wanted him to kiss me.

32:24.571 --> 32:26.331
And I wanted to have sex
with him eventually.

32:29.748 --> 32:31.736
I thought I was gonna be his girlfriend.

32:35.900 --> 32:37.049
What happened?

32:39.200 --> 32:42.467
When we left the bedroom,
I went to the bathroom

32:42.503 --> 32:46.423
and I overheard him bragging
to his mates that...

32:48.891 --> 32:50.675
he'd scored his first black chick.

32:57.680 --> 32:58.960
So what did you do?

33:01.560 --> 33:02.880
I went home.

33:04.640 --> 33:05.760
I left Libby there.

33:07.980 --> 33:09.540
I never saw her again.

33:15.820 --> 33:18.020
I was so ashamed at what happened
to me that...

33:20.740 --> 33:22.680
I never knew what was happening
to Libby.

33:26.380 --> 33:27.500
It's all my fault.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.313
None of this is your fault.

33:32.188 --> 33:34.188
Something terrible happened to you...

33:35.947 --> 33:37.396
and you're not to blame.

33:40.343 --> 33:42.605
You said stop and he didn't.

33:45.157 --> 33:46.425
But if you want...

33:48.579 --> 33:49.822
you can stop him now.

34:14.094 --> 34:15.460
James Northcott.

34:15.670 --> 34:16.899
Yeah?

34:17.493 --> 34:19.569
You're under arrest for sexual assault.

34:19.879 --> 34:21.404
Sexual assault?

34:21.760 --> 34:23.245
Before I ask you any questions,

34:23.280 --> 34:25.056
I must tell you, you have the right
to remain silent.

34:25.080 --> 34:27.536
That means you do not have to say
anything, answer any questions,

34:27.560 --> 34:29.670
or make any statement,
unless you wish to do so.

34:29.706 --> 34:32.351
However, if you do say something
or make a statement,

34:32.388 --> 34:33.728
it may be used later in evidence.

34:33.764 --> 34:35.245
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

34:47.262 --> 34:48.781
We've got a small problem.

34:49.539 --> 34:52.045
James Northcott's copped
to the sexual assaults

34:52.080 --> 34:54.820
but he denies any involvement
with the death of Libby Hewitt.

34:54.856 --> 34:56.701
And, he can prove it.

34:56.880 --> 34:59.725
So around midnight
on the night of the party,

34:59.760 --> 35:02.485
he gets admitted to hospital,
ecstasy overdose.

35:02.520 --> 35:05.779
He stays in hospital all night.
He gets discharged the next day.

35:05.815 --> 35:07.615
- And there's a record of this?
- Yep.

35:09.221 --> 35:10.700
He had ecstasy.

35:11.120 --> 35:13.165
Libby had one in her purse.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.511
They must have had contact at the party,

35:16.000 --> 35:17.640
explains how his hair got there.

35:18.680 --> 35:21.765
- And the blue paint?
- Well, he has no idea.

35:21.800 --> 35:23.325
I mean, the bloke comes from money.

35:23.360 --> 35:26.085
I doubt he's ever lifted a brick
or a paintbrush in his life.

35:26.120 --> 35:27.685
But we got him for the sexual assaults.

35:27.720 --> 35:28.885
He'll do ten years.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.880
But not a day for Libby Hewitt.

35:32.120 --> 35:33.185
No.

35:33.682 --> 35:35.402
- Anyway...
- May I?

35:45.395 --> 35:46.780
_

35:46.816 --> 35:49.878
_

35:56.933 --> 36:00.018
The young man you said did
the brickwork for Ron,

36:00.334 --> 36:01.596
was it him?

36:01.887 --> 36:03.182
Jamie Northcott?

36:04.313 --> 36:05.346
No.

36:06.038 --> 36:08.558
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Positive.

36:09.920 --> 36:10.886
Because...

36:10.921 --> 36:12.040
it was him.

36:12.954 --> 36:14.514
Yeah, that's him.

36:20.320 --> 36:22.280
Jamie Northcott was a rapist?

36:23.723 --> 36:24.843
Jesus.

36:26.036 --> 36:27.316
You think you know someone.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.925
And you drove Jamie to
the hospital that night?

36:31.514 --> 36:33.440
I was the only one sober enough.

36:34.960 --> 36:38.360
So what time Sunday did
Jamie get back to his house?

36:39.596 --> 36:41.565
Maybe Libby was still there,

36:41.600 --> 36:44.245
he assaulted her,
disposed of the body...

36:44.280 --> 36:47.725
No. His parents were coming home
from Europe the next day, so...

36:47.760 --> 36:51.045
So if Jamie was in hospital and
his parents were coming home,

36:51.080 --> 36:52.880
who cleaned up the house?

36:55.140 --> 36:56.165
You did.

36:56.880 --> 36:58.091
Here's the cord, Dad.

37:01.797 --> 37:05.082
I seem to remember you worked
your way through uni, labouring.

37:05.351 --> 37:07.071
Where are we going with this, Dan?

37:08.379 --> 37:09.824
Make that, did you?

37:09.860 --> 37:11.279
No.

37:11.981 --> 37:13.306
I'm not that good.

37:13.342 --> 37:16.147
Yeah, you did! You built
the garden wall and Mum's pergola.

37:16.183 --> 37:17.448
Why don't you go inside?

37:18.907 --> 37:19.908
Just go.

37:25.522 --> 37:26.922
I think you should go too.

37:27.720 --> 37:30.644
You bricked her up, Paul, in that wall.

37:30.680 --> 37:32.096
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.800
The neighbour ID'd you.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.045
- You didn't kill her.
- No.

37:40.080 --> 37:41.080
No.

37:41.256 --> 37:44.472
You gave her CPR. You tried to save her.

37:48.877 --> 37:50.197
What happened, Paul?

37:59.314 --> 38:00.554
Everyone was drinking...

38:01.545 --> 38:02.705
except me.

38:04.754 --> 38:06.834
I had to work for Ron Evans
the next day.

38:07.925 --> 38:09.299
More brickwork.

38:09.553 --> 38:11.953
Did you see the girls?
Melissa and Libby?

38:15.122 --> 38:17.285
And you saw Jamie with Melissa.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.440
Yeah.

38:21.265 --> 38:22.996
He went into a bedroom.

38:24.419 --> 38:26.024
They weren't in there that long.

38:26.910 --> 38:28.499
And you saw Melissa leave?

38:29.713 --> 38:30.725
Yeah.

38:36.200 --> 38:38.788
And then the whole thing went
south at a rate of knots.

38:42.440 --> 38:44.520
Everyone was a mess, Jamie was worse.

38:46.640 --> 38:47.992
I took him to hospital.

38:49.760 --> 38:52.227
And then you went back to clean up.

38:56.040 --> 38:57.680
And that's when you found Libby.

39:10.805 --> 39:13.609
Her mouth, it was full of vomit.

39:14.204 --> 39:15.680
She must have choked.

39:17.033 --> 39:18.766
You tried to revive her?

39:27.159 --> 39:28.604
Paul.

39:28.641 --> 39:31.125
Why didn't you just call an ambulance?

39:31.160 --> 39:32.645
I know I should have, OK?

39:32.680 --> 39:34.644
I wasn't thinking straight.

39:35.076 --> 39:36.445
People had taken E.

39:36.480 --> 39:38.875
There was a dead girl.

39:41.120 --> 39:43.685
I thought I'd lose my scholarship,
I'd lose everything.

39:43.720 --> 39:44.987
So what?

39:46.374 --> 39:48.614
You decided to make the whole thing
go away?

39:50.320 --> 39:52.480
You dragged her onto your van.

39:55.680 --> 39:59.045
You drove her to Ron Evans's.

39:59.080 --> 40:01.280
You busted through the sheet.

40:02.331 --> 40:03.509
You put her in...

40:10.040 --> 40:11.560
and you made her disappear.

40:22.294 --> 40:23.419
What now?

40:23.720 --> 40:25.445
Well, now you call the police...

40:25.480 --> 40:26.533
I was a kid.

40:26.569 --> 40:28.525
Like you should have done
20 years ago.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.845
It was a mistake.

40:29.880 --> 40:32.285
I have a daughter now, like you.

40:32.320 --> 40:34.645
I could be disbarred. Please.
I could go to jail.

40:34.680 --> 40:39.125
She was hidden in a basement,
Paul, for 20 years!

40:39.160 --> 40:41.640
Alone, forgotten.

40:43.320 --> 40:47.040
And everyone who cared about her
never even knew where she was.

40:52.520 --> 40:54.445
I'm not making any admissions.

40:56.880 --> 40:58.802
You can't...

41:01.164 --> 41:02.764
You can't prove any of this.

41:07.422 --> 41:08.702
That cough.

41:10.200 --> 41:12.360
So what? It's the flu.

41:14.040 --> 41:15.280
How long have you had it?

41:17.940 --> 41:21.380
On and off, nearly a year. Why?

41:23.640 --> 41:26.440
When you busted through
that asbestos sheeting...

41:27.760 --> 41:29.600
you must have inhaled
some of the dust.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.560
It's not the flu, Paul.

41:36.060 --> 41:37.900
That's asbestosis.

41:40.360 --> 41:41.840
Now you should tell the police...

41:43.360 --> 41:45.395
and see how long
you have left to live.

44:02.480 --> 44:03.565
It's OK.

44:27.665 --> 44:30.867
My God, it's so pigeony up here.

44:31.477 --> 44:34.620
- I quite like it.
- Yes, you and Harrow both.

44:35.287 --> 44:37.464
You OK?

44:38.120 --> 44:41.014
Did your excavation of
the archive room pay off?

44:41.720 --> 44:42.845
It did.

44:42.880 --> 44:46.566
But not strictly to do with
the autopsy though, was it?

44:48.920 --> 44:51.525
I thought the reason you changed
disciplines was because

44:51.560 --> 44:53.616
you didn't want to be involved
in the tricky business

44:53.640 --> 44:55.560
of friends and relatives.

44:56.421 --> 44:58.610
Because you know where that can lead.

44:59.320 --> 45:00.920
Look, Grace...

45:02.159 --> 45:03.397
I love you.

45:03.719 --> 45:04.803
I know...

45:05.094 --> 45:08.899
I just don't want you to have
spent the last three years

45:09.084 --> 45:11.884
rejigging your career to have
the same thing happen again.

45:14.975 --> 45:16.295
It won't.

45:37.600 --> 45:38.665
Hey.

45:38.765 --> 45:39.810
Hey.

45:39.846 --> 45:42.326
Still looking at the dead man?

45:44.030 --> 45:45.315
What happened?

45:45.640 --> 45:49.885
Francis Chester had earned the right
to work alone in the prison laundry,

45:49.920 --> 45:53.005
where apparently a build up
of lint in one of the dryers

45:53.040 --> 45:54.978
caused a fire to break out and he died.

45:55.440 --> 45:57.965
And dental records? DNA?

45:58.374 --> 46:01.359
All confirmed the body is Chester's.

46:02.640 --> 46:04.603
Your supervisor did the PM.

46:04.913 --> 46:07.753
Dr Laurie Badcoe, one of the best.

46:08.822 --> 46:10.862
He and Jack were like uncles to me.

46:12.367 --> 46:14.513
No, there's no mistake...

46:15.102 --> 46:16.847
Chester is dead.

46:17.588 --> 46:21.769
No one is trying to target me or
take away the things that I love.

46:22.400 --> 46:23.965
I'm just trying to distract myself

46:24.000 --> 46:26.027
from other painful things I have to do.

46:27.600 --> 46:29.418
It's unusual for you to be wrong.

46:29.880 --> 46:31.040
Yes.

46:31.556 --> 46:34.264
I guess it had to happen one day.

46:40.640 --> 46:42.771
It's me, leave a message.

46:42.807 --> 46:43.912
Hey, Fern.

46:44.642 --> 46:47.522
It's me. Call me when you can.

46:49.845 --> 46:51.071
Broken down?

46:51.956 --> 46:53.241
Ha-ha.

46:53.277 --> 46:56.168
Just off home to see if there's
anything edible in the fridge.

46:56.680 --> 46:58.885
I was thinking of Japanese takeaway.

46:58.920 --> 47:00.760
Sounds good.

47:02.480 --> 47:03.640
Do you want to...

47:05.520 --> 47:07.560
- We can't.
- Of course not.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.885
Are we being silly about this.

47:11.257 --> 47:13.525
We're not teenagers at a party,
we're adults.

47:13.560 --> 47:15.956
- We're practically the same age.
- You're too kind.

47:15.992 --> 47:18.005
I'm almost a
fully-qualified pathologist.

47:18.040 --> 47:19.125
Almost.

47:19.160 --> 47:21.245
And the difference
between almost and actual

47:21.280 --> 47:24.285
is the difference between
supervisor and trainee.

47:24.320 --> 47:26.805
The difference between
dinner and not dinner?

47:27.245 --> 47:28.880
I'm afraid so.

47:31.560 --> 47:33.400
Good night then, Dr Harrow.

47:37.880 --> 47:39.440
Good night, Dr Molyneux.

48:13.942 --> 48:15.707
- Hi.
- Hi, Dad.

48:15.859 --> 48:18.099
- Sorry I missed you.
- It's OK.

48:19.240 --> 48:21.880
- I just...
- What? Did you find something?

48:22.680 --> 48:23.745
No.

48:24.245 --> 48:27.645
I'm sorry but I don't think
there's anything to find.

48:29.691 --> 48:31.971
I don't think anyone's targeting me.

48:34.400 --> 48:37.000
I don't think anyone set you up,
to get to me.

48:38.480 --> 48:41.405
- I just wanted to believe...
- That I'm not a thief?

48:41.440 --> 48:44.554
I know you're not. I believe that, Bub.

48:44.590 --> 48:47.713
I just don't have another explanation.

48:48.242 --> 48:49.439
Yeah, it's OK.

48:49.800 --> 48:51.485
Is it? Fern?

48:51.520 --> 48:54.640
Yeah, it'll be fine.
Everything will be OK.

48:58.920 --> 49:00.698
Do you want to come over
and get some dinner?

49:00.734 --> 49:02.539
Erm, not tonight.

49:02.685 --> 49:05.325
Maybe another night, OK?

49:52.240 --> 49:53.885
No.

49:53.920 --> 49:55.760
No.

50:52.534 --> 50:53.979
Good evening, Callan.

50:54.015 --> 50:55.463
Hey, Frank.

51:04.240 --> 51:06.325
Next, on Harrow...

51:06.360 --> 51:08.285
Francis Chester was an anaesthetist.

51:08.320 --> 51:10.765
When you get a feeling like this,
you're not wrong.

51:10.800 --> 51:12.085
This time I am.

51:12.120 --> 51:14.040
Listen, just let me look into this.

51:14.931 --> 51:17.056
That's one bloke
you don't ask questions about.

51:17.216 --> 51:19.621
Dr Harrow, welcome to Port Astor.

51:19.680 --> 51:22.525
One of our local parks and
conservation officers is dead.

51:22.560 --> 51:24.831
He's very charming, very attractive.

51:24.867 --> 51:26.929
What I don't get is why you care.

51:26.965 --> 51:29.765
- How did you manage this?
- I have friends in high places.
