00:03.471 --> 00:04.670
- MALE ANNOUNCER: Tonight,
the singles and the exes

00:04.772 --> 00:07.172
reunite to air out
all their dirty laundry.

00:07.274 --> 00:09.475
Get ready for a night
full of sass--

00:09.577 --> 00:11.510
- I'm a bad bitch, am I?
Thank you!

00:11.612 --> 00:12.511
- ANNOUNCER: --shade--

00:12.613 --> 00:14.613
- Oh, you
[bleep] for free.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.015
- ANNOUNCER: --and ass.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.817
- When your ass moves like
this, come talk to me.

00:18.919 --> 00:21.687
- AUDIENCE:
[cheers and applause]

00:21.789 --> 00:23.956
- I know what real looks
like, and that's flat.

00:24.058 --> 00:26.558
- ANNOUNCER: Find out why some
of our singles went from having

00:26.660 --> 00:30.229
a Mali-boo to
a resting beach face.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.296
- That's [bleep] bull [bleep]!

00:32.400 --> 00:34.700
- Did you cheat on Maya
with a porn star?

00:34.802 --> 00:36.368
- ANNOUNCER:
Who's still in love?

00:36.470 --> 00:39.004
- I know he loves me more
than anything and anyone.

00:39.106 --> 00:41.473
- ANNOUNCER: And who's
saying [bleep] love?

00:41.575 --> 00:42.608
- Oh my god!

00:42.710 --> 00:43.976
- ANNOUNCER: We're
looking for the truth,

00:44.078 --> 00:45.978
and ex marks the spot.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.914
- Don't ever talk to me again.
- Y'all ready to hear the truth?

00:49.016 --> 00:50.149
- AUDIENCE:
[cheers and applause]

00:50.251 --> 00:53.085
- ANNOUNCER: Plus,
the moment no one saw coming.

00:53.187 --> 00:55.521
- Who the [bleep] you talking
to? Don't ever--

00:55.623 --> 00:57.756
- [indistinct yelling]

00:57.858 --> 00:59.091
- [thunderclap]

00:59.193 --> 01:01.093
- ANNOUNCER: The "Ex on
the Beach Reunion" starts now.

01:01.862 --> 01:03.629
- [cheers and applause]

01:03.731 --> 01:05.731
- Welcome to
Spring Break Presents

01:05.833 --> 01:07.466
"Ex on the Beach" Reunion.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.867
It's your man, Romeo.

01:08.969 --> 01:10.335
And helping me hold it down

01:10.438 --> 01:13.472
is the one-and-only
Justina Valentine.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.706
What's good, J?

01:14.809 --> 01:17.076
- I mean, who better to host
the show about love

01:17.178 --> 01:19.378
than Romeo and Valentine?

01:19.480 --> 01:21.146
You're damn right!

01:21.248 --> 01:25.417
Now, your girl also likes
a little bit of the drama,

01:25.519 --> 01:29.321
so I brought the message in a
bottle all the way from Malibu.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.357
So messages--yeah, be scared.
Be very scared.

01:32.460 --> 01:35.260
So messages can
pop up at any time

01:35.362 --> 01:37.963
about anyone
and about anything.

01:38.065 --> 01:41.166
But before we get messy, let's
say what's up to the singles.

01:41.268 --> 01:46.004
Y'all give it up for
Farrah, Cheyenne, Maya,

01:46.107 --> 01:50.709
Jozea, Angela, Chad,
Malcolm,

01:50.811 --> 01:55.013
Nicole, Janelle,
Cory, and Morgan.

01:55.116 --> 01:56.548
- [cheers and applause]

01:56.650 --> 01:57.983
- That's a lot of singles.

01:58.085 --> 01:59.952
But we got so many
exes in the building,

02:00.054 --> 02:02.187
we couldn't fit them
all on one couch.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.623
Repping for the exes
to kick things off

02:04.725 --> 02:08.026
are Nelson, Jay,

02:08.128 --> 02:10.762
Diandra, and Rob.

02:10.865 --> 02:13.999
We've also got some chilling
over there in the ex pit.

02:14.101 --> 02:18.337
Say what up to Nurys,
Darian, Kareem--

02:18.439 --> 02:20.239
- AUDIENCE:
[cheers and applause]

02:20.341 --> 02:22.674
- ROMEO: --Murray, and Simon.

02:22.776 --> 02:26.578
Now, even more exes will be
joining us throughout the show.

02:26.680 --> 02:30.282
Now, last time I saw everyone,
a lot of y'all were in love.

02:30.384 --> 02:33.418
By a show of hands, I wanna
know who still feels that way.

02:33.521 --> 02:34.953
- I'm still in love.

02:35.055 --> 02:36.788
- Put your hand down.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.157
- Put my hand down.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.859
- ANNOUNCER: Looks
like Angela and Nelson

02:40.961 --> 02:42.127
and Janelle and Darian

02:42.229 --> 02:44.863
are still surfing
the wave of love.

02:44.965 --> 02:48.433
Let's hope the reunion doesn't
sink their relationship.

02:48.536 --> 02:52.337
Everyone else's love
crumbled like a sandcastle.

02:52.439 --> 02:55.807
Time to find out why
they're still salty.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.042
- Jozea [bleep] love?

02:57.144 --> 03:00.045
But, Rob, what do you
have to say to that?

03:00.147 --> 03:01.446
- I'm happy myself.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.081
- JUSTINA: Happy by yourself.
- Yeah.

03:03.184 --> 03:06.385
- Farrah, are you surprised
these couples didn't make it?

03:06.487 --> 03:08.253
- No, I'm not surprised, no.
- No?

03:08.355 --> 03:11.490
Like, Jozea and Rob looked like
they were kind of going strong.

03:11.592 --> 03:14.159
- Yeah, it was so weird
when I was seeing Rob, like,

03:14.261 --> 03:16.028
making out with a girl
and stuff like that.

03:16.130 --> 03:18.030
Like, if you're
into a man, I mean,

03:18.132 --> 03:21.400
I'd be damned if somebody
I was there did that to me.

03:21.502 --> 03:25.871
So I love everyone as they are,
but there's just rules of how to

03:25.973 --> 03:27.239
keep a relationship together.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.308
- We're gonna dive into
all of that in a little.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.475
- Alright, alright, that's cool.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.177
- Now, Malibu is
always hot and sunny.

03:32.279 --> 03:34.513
But things got cold
thanks to the shade

03:34.615 --> 03:36.448
thrown by the singles and exes.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.084
- I was most shocked by the
girls when they were unmasked.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.386
I thought they
might be prettier,

03:41.488 --> 03:44.590
but then it was, like,
a different situation.

03:44.692 --> 03:47.326
- Okay, Farrah, do you really
think the other ladies

03:47.428 --> 03:49.328
in the house
aren't beautiful?

03:49.430 --> 03:50.762
- Sure they are, yeah.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.264
- Oh, you do think
they're beautiful?

03:52.366 --> 03:53.699
- Yes, they are.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.834
- Well, now that
she's here and--

03:55.936 --> 03:57.736
- Did you ask me
or did you ask her?

03:57.838 --> 03:59.738
- Well, I can answer
whenever I want to answer

03:59.840 --> 04:01.440
'cause you're on my show, okay?

04:01.542 --> 04:03.976
This isn't you're all that.

04:04.078 --> 04:05.744
You're all that.
- Since we're at the reunion,

04:05.846 --> 04:07.079
what is it with
y'all two ladies?

04:07.181 --> 04:08.347
Why don't y'all like each other?

04:08.449 --> 04:10.549
- I don't like how she
speaks to people in general.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.851
- She doesn't like me, I don't
like her, let's move on.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.052
- Good, good.

04:14.154 --> 04:15.621
- Alright, since we
got that figured out.

04:15.723 --> 04:18.957
- When your ass moves like
this, come talk to me.

04:19.059 --> 04:22.494
- AUDIENCE:
[cheers and applause]

04:22.596 --> 04:25.430
- No ass!
There's, like, no ass.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.232
- I see y'all.
I see y'all, Cory.

04:27.334 --> 04:30.002
- JUSTINA: Well, I want
to learn that move later.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.504
- I know what real looks
like, and that's flat.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.640
- Look, in the finale,
each of you confronted

04:34.742 --> 04:37.242
the ultimate truth by
taking a lie detector test.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.278
Let's get into those results.

04:39.380 --> 04:43.715
Now, Morgan, you said you
were completely over Cory,

04:43.817 --> 04:47.019
but the results show
something different.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.387
Do you still
have feelings for him?

04:48.489 --> 04:49.554
- I don't know.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.456
I feel like if you have
a past with someone,

04:51.558 --> 04:53.392
maybe there's always gonna be,
like, some kind of glimmer.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.127
Maybe that's what
showed up on the test.

04:55.229 --> 04:56.728
But no, Cory Brooks,

04:56.830 --> 05:00.198
I think our time is
officially completely over.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.667
- On to Bananas, right?

05:01.769 --> 05:05.003
- AUDIENCE: Whoa!

05:05.105 --> 05:07.739
- ANNOUNCER: Whoa, whoa,
whoa, let's rewind.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.042
First, Morgan fell
in love with Jay.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.544
But then she got distracted
by Cory's good looks

05:12.646 --> 05:13.945
and made out with him.

05:14.048 --> 05:16.114
Then, she decided
to give Jay another shot

05:16.216 --> 05:17.683
and made him her boyfriend.

05:17.785 --> 05:19.851
She and Jay left
the house together.

05:19.953 --> 05:23.588
But rumor has it they broke up,
and now she's getting

05:23.691 --> 05:26.725
her vitamin D from Johnny
Bananas from "The Challenge."

05:26.827 --> 05:28.660
Yup, the same Johnny Bananas

05:28.762 --> 05:31.663
that Angela hooked up with
while dating Tur'i.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.066
Got it?
Buckle up, Morgan!

05:34.168 --> 05:36.902
Tonight's gonna get bumpy.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.338
- Are you and
Bananas canoodling?

05:39.440 --> 05:41.940
- Here's the thing, is
I already had one relationship

05:42.042 --> 05:43.408
put in the public eye.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.378
You clearly have seen how people
get involved and it gets messy.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.715
I will say that I'm very happy
with how I am in my life now,

05:49.817 --> 05:53.151
and I don't feel the need
to expose more personal details

05:53.253 --> 05:55.387
and relationship.
- Let me ask you a question.

05:55.489 --> 05:58.056
Jay, what is your reaction
to Morgan

05:58.158 --> 06:00.125
and her new relationship
with Bananas?

06:00.227 --> 06:01.960
- Enjoy your potassium.
I don't know.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.962
- Enjoy your potassium?
Alright.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.997
- ROMEO: Well, I got a question.
It's for Janelle.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.367
Your results revealed that you
were lying when you said

06:08.469 --> 06:10.102
Darian wouldn't cheat on you.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.903
Since the show ended,

06:12.005 --> 06:14.639
what has he done to prove
that he's committed?

06:14.742 --> 06:16.908
- Well...

06:17.010 --> 06:19.611
I would like to
think that Darian--

06:19.713 --> 06:21.580
He worships the ground
that I walk on,

06:21.682 --> 06:24.015
'cause he realizes that
I'm a good [bleep] woman.

06:24.118 --> 06:26.885
I am faithful.
I am loyal.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.453
I'm a ride-or-die bitch.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.922
You will never
upgrade after me ever.

06:31.024 --> 06:34.726
And, um, he shows me that he
loves me ever day, so, yeah.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.461
- ROMEO: Whoa.
- JUSTINA: Sock it.

06:36.563 --> 06:39.030
So, Darian, you've been
a good boy since the house?

06:39.133 --> 06:42.934
- 100%. Like, she makes me a
better person every single day.

06:43.036 --> 06:45.904
And the one thing I really
regret was just completely

06:46.006 --> 06:48.640
embarrassing her on the show--
- Thank you.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.143
- DARIAN: --by my own actions.
- Do it!

06:51.245 --> 06:53.044
- That's [bleep] I'll never
be able to take back.

06:53.147 --> 06:55.480
- I see my girl Nurys over
there, making a couple of faces.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.848
Talk to us.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.785
- I mean, yeah, he was not
faithful to her, so that's that.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.586
There's proof of that.
- JUSTINA: You have receipts.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.488
- I have receipts. 100%.
- Bring 'em out, bitch.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.624
- I don't need to bring 'em out.
You know it.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.659
You know it yourself.
Why are you trying to lie?

07:07.761 --> 07:10.128
- JANELLE: Bring them out.
- So I'll comment on that.

07:10.230 --> 07:13.398
We sent Janelle
a picture of me on a couch

07:13.500 --> 07:16.001
looking at a girl's phone,
looking at a girl's phone.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.069
- Darian, do not [bleep]--
Do not [bleep]!

07:18.172 --> 07:20.071
Sorry, but he [bleep] [bleep]
another bitch

07:20.174 --> 07:21.940
at a [bleep] party.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.309
- Prove it. Prove it!

07:24.411 --> 07:26.678
- Bring it up!
- Pull it up!

07:26.780 --> 07:27.813
Let me see it!

07:27.915 --> 07:29.347
- You wish!
You wish!

07:29.450 --> 07:31.416
You wish you had a [bleep]--

07:31.518 --> 07:33.585
- You are [bleep] amazing!
You are too good for him!

07:33.687 --> 07:35.454
I don't know how you
don't realize that!

07:35.556 --> 07:38.356
- AUDIENCE:
[cheers and applause]

07:38.459 --> 07:40.525
- JUSTINA: Alright, guys, we're
gonna get into the details

07:40.627 --> 07:42.294
of Janelle and Darian's
relationship

07:42.396 --> 07:43.328
a little bit later on,

07:43.430 --> 07:44.729
'cause it's
definitely a hot topic.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.064
But we need to keep it moving.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.266
Okay, Cheyenne,
what were you thinking

07:48.368 --> 07:51.803
when two of Murray's results
come back inconclusive?

07:51.905 --> 07:54.673
- Uh, I honestly, with Murray,

07:54.775 --> 07:56.741
wasn't surprised
by that fact.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.210
- JUSTINA: Weren't surprising?

07:58.312 --> 08:00.445
- It's kind of the results
I've been getting from him

08:00.547 --> 08:03.548
since day one,
a lot of inconclusive.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.484
- Within 24 hours of
getting out of that house,

08:05.586 --> 08:07.252
you were already having
sex with other people.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.087
- Who am I--I can do
whatever I want,

08:09.189 --> 08:10.922
sleep with whoever I
want when I'm single.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.624
- But at least wait
24 [bleep] hours.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.893
- Cheyenne, is that true?
- Give me a day, girl.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.595
- Oh, I can definitely confirm

08:16.697 --> 08:18.697
that I had sex when
I got out of the house.

08:18.799 --> 08:19.965
Was it with Murray?
No.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.702
- Now, the drama that started
in the house continued

08:23.804 --> 08:25.704
after everyone left Malibu.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.172
Let's dive into what happened

08:27.274 --> 08:29.040
once the cameras
stopped rolling.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.643
This is cross-examination.

08:35.349 --> 08:38.517
Chad, Nicole posted videos
of you drunk on Instagram.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.051
What do you have to say to her?

08:40.153 --> 08:41.785
- I'm saying [bleep] this,
[bleep] that, [bleep] her,

08:41.889 --> 08:43.154
[bleep] everyone.
I'm getting the [bleep]

08:43.256 --> 08:45.657
Out of here if you guys air
that [bleep] [bleep].

08:45.759 --> 08:47.292
That's [bleep] bull [bleep].

08:47.394 --> 08:48.260
- AUDIENCE: Whoa!

08:48.362 --> 08:49.761
- You would do
that [bleep] to me?

08:49.863 --> 08:50.795
Put that out there?

08:50.898 --> 08:55.066
- [shouting, arguing]

08:55.168 --> 08:56.735
- You feel better?
Do you feel better?

08:56.837 --> 08:58.603
- Don't ever [bleep]
talk to me like that!

08:58.705 --> 09:02.374
- [indistinct yelling]

09:02.476 --> 09:04.309
- He ain't gonna
[bleep] treat me like that.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.046
- JUSTINA: Okay, okay, okay.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.981
Things are getting [bleep]
too heated here, guys.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.350
We're gonna calm things down
and we'll be right back.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.719
- ANNOUNCER: Coming up, if
you thought that was crazy,

09:14.821 --> 09:18.056
we're about to
crank things up to 100.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.391
- If you're gonna
talk about her,

09:19.493 --> 09:21.660
talk about her in the right way.
She's not here.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.929
- I would say that to her face.
She's a trashy bitch.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.598
- I could've had sex
with her, but I didn't.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.799
- There's two sides of Farrah.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.101
- I think I have
more sides than two.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.436
- ♪

09:31.538 --> 09:32.170

- ANNOUNCER: Welcome back to
the "Ex on the Beach" reunion.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.347
Here's where we left off.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.616
Chad and Nicole got into
a screaming match about

09:44.718 --> 09:48.119
the embarrassing video
she posted of him online.

09:48.221 --> 09:51.423
Nicole gave Chad a piece
of her mind before storming out

09:51.525 --> 09:53.491
like it was the pink party.

09:53.594 --> 09:56.394
- NICOLE: I can't handle a man
screaming and doing this in

09:56.496 --> 09:59.698
my [bleep] face, and thinking,
like, I'm just not gonna react.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.032
That's [bleep] crazy to me.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.467
I know she was
pushing my buttons

10:02.569 --> 10:03.768
to get me to do something.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.870
Like, why?

10:05.973 --> 10:08.840
- Now, first off,
Chad, are you good?

10:08.942 --> 10:09.841
- Feel good.

10:09.943 --> 10:10.742
- ROMEO: Yeah?

10:10.844 --> 10:12.043
- Feel fine.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.812
- Okay, now, things got intense.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.781
And here at MTV, we do
not condone violence.

10:16.883 --> 10:18.717
Now, because of what
happened with Nicole,

10:18.819 --> 10:21.586
we will not let her be
allowed to return to set.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.421
Justina is backstage
with her right now,

10:23.523 --> 10:25.190
trying to get some answers.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.927
Safe to say, you and Nicole
are not together anymore?

10:29.029 --> 10:30.929
- I would say we're not
exactly on speaking terms.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.831
- ROMEO: Not exactly?
- Not quite.

10:32.933 --> 10:35.767
- So let us know what
happened out there.

10:35.869 --> 10:36.935
- I [bleep] up.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.170
I shouldn't have
put my hands on him.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.206
And for that, I am sorry.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.609
And I wish I could tell him that
to his face, but can't do that.

10:44.711 --> 10:48.513
But I'm not gonna stand for
a guy getting in my face,

10:48.615 --> 10:52.617
screaming, pointing his [bleep]
finger in my face over something

10:52.719 --> 10:55.020
he put on the internet,
and I just brought to light

10:55.122 --> 10:57.255
because he has issues.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.190
- What happened after the house?

10:59.292 --> 11:01.459
- She got mad 'cause I
didn't talk to her enough.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.328
Uh, she started
talking to other guys.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.430
I slowed up on talking to her.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.532
She was talking to
her ex, Nate, every day,

11:07.634 --> 11:10.068
who all the while was telling
me he was hooking up with her.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.569
Couldn't get her to
stop talking to him,

11:11.672 --> 11:12.804
'cause obviously
that's upsetting.

11:12.906 --> 11:15.073
So the breaking point was
probably we flew down--

11:15.175 --> 11:16.474
Or I flew down to Miami.

11:16.576 --> 11:19.344
And the whole time, she was
Snapchatting other dudes.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.912
- Like, did you
think that Nicole

11:21.014 --> 11:22.681
was possibly cheating on you?

11:22.783 --> 11:24.349
- Yeah, I think 100%.

11:24.451 --> 11:27.585
- It all went downhill
when he was ignoring me,

11:27.688 --> 11:29.521
not speaking to me.

11:29.623 --> 11:31.523
You're sending me two
or three texts a day.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.758
You live in I.A.
I live in Florida.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.393
Like, what's the [bleep] deal?

11:35.495 --> 11:38.229
- So it was like once you left
the house, it was just, like,

11:38.331 --> 11:41.533
the magic was gone,
whatever magic was there.

11:41.635 --> 11:45.470
- I broke up with him because I
just wasn't feeling it anymore

11:45.572 --> 11:49.474
and he was persistently
asking me to, like,

11:49.576 --> 11:50.975
"Give me a chance,
give me a chance.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.377
I wanna make it work."

11:52.479 --> 11:53.645
So I'm, like, thinking,
stupidly, okay,

11:53.747 --> 11:54.846
let me give you a chance.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.181
Maybe we'll make it work.

11:56.283 --> 11:59.117
And during the time of
us figuring things out,

11:59.219 --> 12:03.488
he was on Bumble, talking to
other girls, while in my area.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.890
And then I found out that
he also was hitting on

12:05.992 --> 12:07.759
my ex's ex-fiancée.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.361
- Well, once we broke up,
I hit up his ex-fiancée.

12:10.464 --> 12:13.598
And I could've had sex
with her, but I didn't.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.700
- You couldn't afford that.
- Wait, wait, Chad.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.535
So you hit up Nate's ex-fiancée?

12:17.637 --> 12:19.304
- Yeah
- He got a hard-on for me.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.072
- Did she respond?
- Yeah, for sure.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.074
It was New Year's night.
- What did she say?

12:23.176 --> 12:24.843
- She said some stuff.
I'm not gonna--

12:24.945 --> 12:26.244
- [laughs] Nothing.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.846
She said, "Oh, yeah,
I'm going out tonight.

12:27.948 --> 12:28.880
How about you?"

12:28.982 --> 12:30.782
Oh, you [bleep]
wheeled that, bro.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.684
Oh, you had that in [bleep]
the bag, didn't you?

12:32.786 --> 12:34.452
- Hey, you don't
know [bleep], man.

12:34.554 --> 12:35.887
- I have a receipt of it.

12:35.989 --> 12:38.056
- Well, we got Maddie
here, Chad's ex.

12:38.158 --> 12:41.259
Now, Maddie, what did you think
when you came into the house and

12:41.361 --> 12:44.062
saw Chad and Nicole in
a serious relationship?

12:44.164 --> 12:47.632
- I was kind of shocked that he
was in a serious relationship.

12:47.734 --> 12:49.834
"Serious relationship."

12:49.936 --> 12:53.304
But I knew it wasn't gonna last.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.774
- So why do you think Maddie
treated you the way she did

12:55.876 --> 12:57.709
the second she walked
in the house?

12:57.811 --> 13:00.545
- She was just so upset
that Chad didn't want her.

13:00.647 --> 13:02.180
"I'm just gonna say
she ain't [bleep].

13:02.282 --> 13:03.414
"She's ghetto.
She's trashy.

13:03.517 --> 13:04.482
"She's this.
She's that.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.284
She's fake.
She's gross."

13:06.386 --> 13:08.253
Everything in the book
to bring me down

13:08.355 --> 13:09.954
to uplift her self-esteem.

13:10.056 --> 13:13.324
But in reality, she loses,
because it just shows

13:13.426 --> 13:15.527
how insecure
you are about yourself.

13:15.629 --> 13:19.063
- Maddie, I heard that Nicole
leaked your number online.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.232
Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.401
She--one of the tea accounts,
I guess,

13:23.503 --> 13:25.537
told her I was talking
[bleep] about her on my vlog,

13:25.639 --> 13:29.774
which I wasn't doing that
yet--'til after she did this.

13:29.876 --> 13:33.411
And then she went and
sent them text messages,

13:33.513 --> 13:35.947
of her saying she's gonna
smack me to this tea account,

13:36.049 --> 13:38.016
and didn't hide my number
with my name.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.184
- No, Maddie.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.786
Yo, you literally
hit up Nicole saying,

13:41.888 --> 13:43.154
"Hey, your makeup
looks so good."

13:43.256 --> 13:45.056
- Because I was trying
to be cool with her!

13:45.158 --> 13:46.691
And then she started
talking [bleep].

13:46.793 --> 13:48.593
- Everything was fine, and
then you, out of nowhere,

13:48.695 --> 13:50.862
start going online,
throwing [bleep] at Nicole.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.297
- No, I wasn't!

13:52.399 --> 13:55.200
- That was way after Nicole had
been blasting her constantly.

13:55.302 --> 13:58.703
Maddie would say one comment,
and then she would go blow it up

13:58.805 --> 14:02.640
and send it to tea pages, and
start all these wars online.

14:02.742 --> 14:03.775
- I wish Nicole was here.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.577
- So let's talk about
Maddie a little bit.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.446
You posted her phone number
on social media.

14:08.548 --> 14:11.216
- I posted her number in
a group chat with people

14:11.318 --> 14:13.451
that don't care about her.
No one called her.

14:13.553 --> 14:14.819
- So it wasn't
on social media?

14:14.921 --> 14:17.088
- No.
- I thought it was on Instagram.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.723
- No, she likes to
exaggerate things.

14:18.825 --> 14:23.061
She loves to hate me, but does
not want to admit that she was

14:23.163 --> 14:25.129
low key trying to be nice
to me in text messages

14:25.232 --> 14:27.365
and I posted that.
Like, she's a clout chaser.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.500
She wants attention.
She wants to be on TV.

14:29.603 --> 14:33.004
And her claim to fame is
riding Chad's coattail.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.372
- So was there anything else

14:34.474 --> 14:37.075
that you would want
to tell Chad today?

14:37.177 --> 14:39.344
- There was genuine love there
on my end.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.379
And I don't want
to get emotional,

14:41.481 --> 14:44.649
but I truly hope that he
finds happiness in his life.

14:44.751 --> 14:45.917
I do.
- That's nice.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.785
- And I wish him
nothing but the best.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.921
And...

14:50.023 --> 14:51.656
it's just unfortunate the way
everything went down.

14:51.758 --> 14:55.393
- Is there anything else
that you would say to Maddie?

14:55.495 --> 14:58.096
- The one thing that
I would tell Maddie is

14:58.198 --> 15:00.365
good luck in life,
and I hope you don't choke.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.901
Like, that girl's evil.

15:03.003 --> 15:06.070
- I mean, she's a violent bitch,
is what I think.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.906
- Oh, she's a bitch
'cause she's not here.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.274
- Well, she's not wrong.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.176
- She's a trashy bitch!
- Don't do that!

15:12.279 --> 15:15.380
- I would say that to her face.
She's a trashy bitch.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.782
- Jozea, just stop, you look so
stupid right now, man.

15:17.884 --> 15:19.017
- She's talking about my friend!

15:19.119 --> 15:20.151
What the [bleep]
you talking about?

15:20.253 --> 15:21.853
- Would you shut up
and let me talk?

15:21.955 --> 15:23.655
- She's not here!
- And that's her fault!

15:23.757 --> 15:25.156
- If you're gonna
talk about her,

15:25.258 --> 15:27.058
talk about her in the right way.
She's not here.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.526
I don't like how you move.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.829
I don't, because what you do is
you come into a show like this,

15:31.932 --> 15:33.164
you give a smile.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.432
"Oh, I'm friendly,
I'm friendly."

15:34.534 --> 15:36.167
Then behind closed doors,
you want, "Oh, that bitch,

15:36.269 --> 15:38.069
and that bitch, and that
bitch, and that bitch."

15:38.171 --> 15:39.737
But you can't do it
to nobody's face.

15:39.839 --> 15:41.639
- Pretty sure I wasn't rude
to anybody except Nicole.

15:41.741 --> 15:44.008
- You guys literally
get on live constantly.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.510
She went on [bleep] live
talking about some

15:45.612 --> 15:47.612
"I'm bringing receipts
[bleep] reunion."

15:47.714 --> 15:49.480
- I didn't say [bleep]
about bringing any receipts.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.349
- "I'm bringing the receipts
to the reunion,

15:51.451 --> 15:53.985
"what I'm about to do Rob,
spilling all my [bleep] tea

15:54.087 --> 15:55.586
on the [bleep] page, bitch."

15:55.689 --> 15:57.021
Don't be spilling
my [bleep] [bleep]

15:57.123 --> 16:00.625
'Cause your storyline
is dry and done. Done!

16:00.727 --> 16:02.460
Just like your face!
- How old are you?

16:02.562 --> 16:04.696
- I'm [bleep] 27.
- Well, you act like you're 12.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.165
- And you look 50!
- No one cares.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.267
- I gave you my Christian Dior
foundation to wear

16:09.369 --> 16:11.336
on the [bleep] show,
bitch, don't try it.

16:11.438 --> 16:12.603
A lot of it!

16:12.706 --> 16:14.205
- We're all wearing
makeup right now [bleep]!

16:14.307 --> 16:15.206
- You sure are!

16:15.308 --> 16:16.708
- You look like
a cactus right now!

16:16.810 --> 16:19.010
- I'm a bad bitch!
I'm a bad bitch, am I?

16:19.112 --> 16:21.646
Thank you!
- CROWD: [cheers and applause]

16:21.748 --> 16:23.181
- And what the [bleep]
you look like?

16:23.283 --> 16:25.183
- Shut up, bro.
- Shut the [bleep] up!

16:25.285 --> 16:26.617
- ROMEO: Alright,
alright, everybody.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.086
We've got a lot more
relationships

16:28.188 --> 16:30.221
we need to break down.
Stick around.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.157
This is "Ex on the
Beach: The Reunion."

16:33.259 --> 16:35.693
- Tell us one nice thing
about Simon.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.228
- He is out of my life.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.563
- AUDIENCE: [laughter]

16:38.665 --> 16:40.898
- Obviously, I wasn't gonna put
my vagina on the internet

16:41.001 --> 16:42.333
like you would.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.869
- We've got the lie detector.
- Y'all ready to hear the truth?

16:46.106 --> 16:47.205
- [thunderclap]

16:50.010 --> 16:50.708
- [thunderclap]

16:50.810 --> 16:55.646
- [cheers and applause]

16:55.749 --> 16:56.714
- Welcome back.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.616
It's Spring Break here at MTV.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.051
What better way to celebrate

17:00.153 --> 17:02.186
than with the kings
and queens of Malibu.

17:02.288 --> 17:04.288
The stage is filled
with exes and singles.

17:04.391 --> 17:08.593
Joining us now in the ex pit,
say what's up to Sha.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.060
- Welcome, welcome.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.663
Now, there was one single in the
house who was more interested

17:12.766 --> 17:14.499
in sleeping than finding love.

17:14.601 --> 17:15.833
But that didn't stop her

17:15.935 --> 17:18.202
from speaking her mind
and clapping back.

17:18.304 --> 17:19.470
Take a look.

17:19.571 --> 17:24.474
- Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a stage-four diva.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.742
- Surprise!

17:25.845 --> 17:27.678
- Farrah's being a prima donna.

17:27.781 --> 17:30.448
- Looks like we do not
have, like, towels in here.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.483
I feel like I
can't [bleep] live.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.385
- Farrah thinks she's
over here on the A list.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.320
- I am probably the largest star
on the show.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.656
- Z list for you.
- The whole thing with, uh,

17:38.758 --> 17:40.658
Nazarian or whatever
her name is--

17:40.760 --> 17:42.393
- WOMAN: What is her name?

17:42.495 --> 17:46.564
- Nazar--N--Na--
Something with an N.

17:46.666 --> 17:47.598
- Farrah, Jay--

17:47.700 --> 17:48.933
- I'm just not
gonna touch people.

17:49.035 --> 17:49.901
- Oh!

17:50.003 --> 17:51.302
- FARRAH: I wasn't
woken up today.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.271
I was told I'd be
woken up at 7 a.m.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.106
No one gives a [bleep].
It's disrespectful.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.507
- I wish I had a mirror

17:56.609 --> 17:58.109
so you can see yourself
talking right now.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.978
- Good, and I would actually be
happier looking at me than you.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.246
Don't worry!

18:02.348 --> 18:04.382
I don't know why the [bleep]
you're a rude-ass bitch.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.017
- Farrah, no. Farrah, no.
Farrah, no!

18:06.119 --> 18:08.152
- [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]!

18:08.254 --> 18:10.421
- You're a disgusting
trash-ass whore!

18:10.523 --> 18:12.390
- You ugly-ass bitch!

18:12.492 --> 18:14.926
- CROWD: [cheers and applause]

18:15.028 --> 18:18.196
- Okay, Farrah, have you
figured out how to say her name,

18:18.298 --> 18:20.865
the girl right there in the red?
- FARRAH: No, no.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.333
- You know how to say it.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.068
- --Is so fabulous.
She can fix her vagina.

18:24.170 --> 18:27.205
- But in all the interviews
she knows how to say my name

18:27.307 --> 18:28.606
every time
she was talking [bleep].

18:28.708 --> 18:30.541
But now you don't know
how to say my name.

18:30.643 --> 18:31.809
- JUSTINA: One at a time.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.478
Maybe if you repeat after me.

18:33.580 --> 18:39.183
- I'm not, so I--
My mouth doesn't--

18:39.285 --> 18:41.752
Form or go that direction.
But thank you for that.

18:41.855 --> 18:43.588
- Jozea, you've always
been Team Farrah.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.189
Why did you guys click?

18:45.291 --> 18:48.659
- Man, I relate to Farrah
because I felt like Farrah

18:48.761 --> 18:51.395
was more--she was there
for more than just love.

18:51.498 --> 18:52.897
She was there for self-love.

18:52.999 --> 18:56.534
- Now, Simon,
is what we saw of Farrah

18:56.636 --> 18:59.237
what she's like in
y'all relationship?

18:59.339 --> 19:01.072
- You know, there's
two sides to Farrah.

19:01.174 --> 19:03.975
I mean, for the camera, she
definitely turns it a bit.

19:04.077 --> 19:05.209
- There's only two sides?

19:05.311 --> 19:06.978
I think I have
more sides than two.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.313
- So, Farrah, can you tell us

19:09.415 --> 19:11.883
one nice thing right now
about Simon?

19:11.985 --> 19:14.018
Just one.
- He is out of my life.

19:14.120 --> 19:17.722
That is so nice.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.124
- Was there anything
you were hoping to get

19:20.226 --> 19:22.393
out of going into the house?
- No, I just wanted to

19:22.495 --> 19:23.961
give her the head's up on why

19:24.063 --> 19:25.763
she hasn't found
a good person in her life,

19:25.865 --> 19:26.764
like a solid relationship.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.299
- There's no head's up
you can give.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.567
- Hang on, let me finish.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.402
I'm not here to
bring you down or anything.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.704
I'm just giving you good advice.
- You can't.

19:33.806 --> 19:37.441
- The problem is, is that--
Okay, I mean, it is what it is.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.143
All I'm saying is that
she needs to be

19:39.245 --> 19:40.344
more authentic with herself.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.813
- I am all about being
genuine, authentic,

19:42.916 --> 19:44.649
especially with my child,
especially with everything

19:44.751 --> 19:46.918
I live my life, too.
Thank you.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.387
- So that's what you think
is stopping Farrah

19:49.489 --> 19:50.688
from finding love?

19:50.790 --> 19:52.890
- She has this guard up.
She's got this shell up.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.826
And she just, you know--and I
get it. I get it, you know?

19:55.929 --> 19:57.595
She's got people around
her that are trying to

19:57.697 --> 19:59.363
knock on her door and
using her for stuff.

19:59.465 --> 20:02.333
I get that.
- Including you.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.268
- I don't need nothing.
I've been a millionaire before.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.771
I don't need that.
- Wait, you're a schmillionaire?

20:06.873 --> 20:08.906
- But I like billionaires now.
- You like billionaires?

20:09.008 --> 20:10.041
- Yeah.

20:10.143 --> 20:11.609
- Are you still
in love with her?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.411
- I still got love
for Farrah, yeah.

20:13.513 --> 20:16.080
- You don't know what love is.

20:16.182 --> 20:18.382
- Farrah, at times, Janelle
and Maya had to push you

20:18.484 --> 20:19.684
to talk to Simon.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.752
Why were you so
reluctant to talk to him?

20:21.854 --> 20:25.122
- What is the words that
my lovely ladies say to me?

20:25.225 --> 20:27.858
Fake the funk?

20:27.961 --> 20:29.560
- Sometimes you
gotta do it in life.

20:29.662 --> 20:32.363
- And I just really--you know,
I love being called shady,

20:32.465 --> 20:33.598
and I'm fake, and I'm this.

20:33.700 --> 20:38.936
But I really, really don't
like to fake the funk...

20:39.038 --> 20:40.938
at all.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.373
It's hard!
- Break it down.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.808
What's faking the funk?

20:43.910 --> 20:46.277
- Faking the funk is acting
like you like somebody

20:46.379 --> 20:48.079
when you know you
can't stand their ass.

20:48.181 --> 20:52.383
- So you feel you
have to fake liking Simon?

20:52.485 --> 20:53.985
But you did date for some time.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.653
You had to have
had some good times

20:55.755 --> 20:57.355
throughout the relationship.
- Yeah, we had good times.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.956
- I think I always
have good times.

20:59.058 --> 21:02.426
If I'm a part of it,
I'm [bleep] great time.

21:02.528 --> 21:05.963
- Alright, now, Farrah, let's
talk about your karate kick

21:06.065 --> 21:07.365
below the belt.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.667
You have really good aim
if you were, in fact,

21:09.769 --> 21:10.901
aiming for the vagina.

21:11.004 --> 21:12.603
- You shouldn't have
[bleep] hit that bitch.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.272
- Were you aiming
for the vagina?

21:14.374 --> 21:16.374
- Maybe my kick
didn't kick her mouth,

21:16.476 --> 21:18.876
it hit some other lips.
Like, I just don't know!

21:18.978 --> 21:21.779
- JUSTINA: You were happy
with either of the lips.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.180
- ROMEO: That's the
bruise right there.

21:23.283 --> 21:24.949
- That was right
here on my thigh.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.917
Like, that was because she
kicked me with heels on

21:27.020 --> 21:28.686
'cause she's a [bleep]
bleep], you know?

21:28.788 --> 21:30.454
- FARRAH: Thigh or the crotch?

21:30.556 --> 21:32.156
- Do you want to
see my vagina, too?

21:32.258 --> 21:33.858
Because bitch, obviously I
wasn't gonna put my vagina

21:33.960 --> 21:36.360
on the internet like you would.
So I'm sorry.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.561
Like, I'm sorry.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.697
- [shouting]

21:39.799 --> 21:43.034
- Would you like me to show you?
Would you like me to show you?

21:43.136 --> 21:45.736
Farrah, what if someone kicked
your daughter in the vagina?

21:45.838 --> 21:47.772
What if somebody kicked
your daughter in the vagina?

21:47.874 --> 21:50.041
- I would beat their [bleep] ass
and drag them.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.976
- Okay, well, I hope
that happens to her.

21:52.078 --> 21:54.378
I hope that happens to her.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.446
- You know what?

21:55.548 --> 21:56.814
You want to bring
up my daughter?

21:56.916 --> 21:58.049
Good luck to you.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.451
I will handle your [bleep]
disgusting tramp ass.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.887
- Thank you!
- Don't worry, honey.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.689
- Alright. It doesn't
look like these two

22:04.791 --> 22:06.957
are gonna be friends
anytime soon.

22:07.060 --> 22:10.061
- Coming up, we'll talk about
a relationship that fell apart

22:10.163 --> 22:13.864
once they left the house
and reality set in.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.232
- ANNOUNCER: Grab your popcorn.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.600
This is getting good.

22:16.703 --> 22:19.370
- I do do massage,
and I do it naked.

22:19.472 --> 22:23.074
- "Did you cheat on me
after we left the show?"

22:23.176 --> 22:27.511
- Run me my mother [bleep]
money, bitch.

22:27.613 --> 22:28.879
- [thunderclap]

22:31.184 --> 22:32.750
- ♪

22:32.852 --> 22:35.353

22:35.455 --> 22:38.255
- Welcome back to"
Ex on the Beach: The Reunion."

22:38.358 --> 22:39.757
So let's go and
dive into the couple

22:39.859 --> 22:41.058
that was drunk in love.

22:41.160 --> 22:45.129
I'm talking about Rob
and Jozea--AKA, Rozea.

22:45.231 --> 22:46.764
- ♪ Are you ready for it ♪

22:46.866 --> 22:50.968
♪

22:51.070 --> 22:53.437
- Jozea, why were you
so excited to see Rob?

22:53.539 --> 22:55.539
- I haven't seen him
in a very long time.

22:55.641 --> 22:58.309
So when he came up on the beach,
I was like, [bleep], okay, well,

22:58.411 --> 23:00.177
you know, all these
emotions came through,

23:00.279 --> 23:01.345
and I was just, like, okay.

23:01.447 --> 23:03.047
- Rob, did you
show up to the beach

23:03.149 --> 23:04.515
wanting to rekindle with Jozea?

23:04.617 --> 23:06.717
- Actually, like he said, it
was just something that, like,

23:06.819 --> 23:08.386
this has been going on
for ten years.

23:08.488 --> 23:11.288
So it was, like, we just
needed to [bleep] off the pot.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.324
Like, this is ridiculous,
you know what I mean?

23:13.426 --> 23:15.059
We need to find out
whether we're good together

23:15.161 --> 23:16.527
and it's gonna work.

23:16.629 --> 23:19.130
And if that's the case, then we
need make some compromises and,

23:19.232 --> 23:20.564
like, actually make this work.

23:20.666 --> 23:24.268
Or, if this is, like, how things
are, we're just making excuses,

23:24.370 --> 23:26.170
and we shouldn't be together,
you know what I mean?

23:26.272 --> 23:28.606
- Do you think that the
experience on "Ex on the Beach"

23:28.708 --> 23:30.975
helped you guys?
- I will say in our predicament,

23:31.077 --> 23:32.777
it actually brought
things to surface

23:32.879 --> 23:34.979
and made us,
like, deal with issues.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.548
- Jozea and Rob were one of the
strongest couples in the house.

23:37.650 --> 23:40.251
But during the animal party,
Rob turned into a dog,

23:40.353 --> 23:43.687
ditching Jozea to lick barbecue
sauce off Morgan's boobs.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.122
Let's take a look.

23:45.224 --> 23:46.657
- MAN: Two...

23:46.759 --> 23:48.793
one!

23:48.895 --> 23:50.161
Oh!

23:50.263 --> 23:52.430
- I mean, a club soda and vodka,
whatever the hell,

23:52.532 --> 23:55.566
just bring me something.
I'm thirsty!

23:55.668 --> 23:59.003
- Rob, you were supposed
to be getting Jozea drunk.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.704
How did you end up
in a three-way kiss?

24:00.807 --> 24:02.373
- Um, not a waiter.

24:02.475 --> 24:05.209
Um, and I got my own drink
and went and had my own fun.

24:05.311 --> 24:07.745
- Okay, you do your own thing
at that party.

24:07.847 --> 24:09.447
Listen, let me
tell you something.

24:09.549 --> 24:12.583
What I don't--I don't
[bleep] [bleep] is disrespect,

24:12.685 --> 24:13.984
and you need to watch yourself.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.220
Don't play with me, because
the last time I checked,

24:16.322 --> 24:18.556
you were my mother [bleep]
man in the house, was he not?

24:18.658 --> 24:19.690
- Yeah.
- Was he not?

24:19.792 --> 24:21.091
- He was yours.
- Okay.

24:21.194 --> 24:23.260
So like I said--
Like I said, I did not--

24:23.362 --> 24:25.429
And I'm gonna say this
in the nicest way I can.

24:25.531 --> 24:27.531
- I'm not owned, baby.
- --heated as hell right now,

24:27.633 --> 24:30.034
but I'm gonna try to say this
nic to both of you ladies.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.002
Now, me and Morgan spoke
about it yesterday,

24:32.104 --> 24:33.637
so I don't have to
address her now.

24:33.739 --> 24:36.707
But Diandra, I felt,
as a gay man,

24:36.809 --> 24:40.277
that I don't care if I'm
transgender, gay, straight,

24:40.379 --> 24:41.679
woman--I don't give a [bleep].

24:41.781 --> 24:43.214
You should never lay
your lips on him,

24:43.316 --> 24:44.715
and he should never
lay your lips you,

24:44.817 --> 24:46.851
and just like you should
never lay your lips on Morgan.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.486
I felt disrespected.

24:48.588 --> 24:51.522
If I was a girl, you know
damn well that whole scenario

24:51.624 --> 24:53.023
would've went another way.
You know it.

24:53.125 --> 24:56.026
Now because I'm a guy, I have to
watch what I have to say to you,

24:56.128 --> 24:57.761
because it's really
pissing me off.

24:57.864 --> 25:00.331
- Okay, well, that's--thank
goodness you brought that up,

25:00.433 --> 25:02.466
because I genuinely
apologize to you

25:02.568 --> 25:04.535
because I should not
have done that.

25:04.637 --> 25:05.803
- Thank you, thank you.

25:05.905 --> 25:11.709
- [applause]

25:11.811 --> 25:14.445
- Alright, Rob, walk us through
why you and Jozea broke up

25:14.547 --> 25:15.946
in the first place.

25:16.048 --> 25:17.915
- I felt like
we just started, like--

25:18.017 --> 25:19.750
Two people want to be together.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.519
They're holding hands.
They're walking down the path.

25:21.621 --> 25:24.321
I just felt like our paths got
so far away from each other,

25:24.423 --> 25:25.823
we couldn't hold hands anymore.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.892
Like, we weren't really
good for each other.

25:27.994 --> 25:29.793
That's--that's how I felt.

25:29.896 --> 25:32.763
- Well, I have a little
different story about that.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.332
Um, he seems to have
temporary amnesia.

25:35.434 --> 25:38.769
Why we really broke up was
because his birthday came up

25:38.871 --> 25:40.738
around December-ish, correct?

25:40.840 --> 25:42.206
Am I right? Okay.

25:42.308 --> 25:45.309
So, like, he never [bleep] text
me, do you want to hang out?

25:45.411 --> 25:47.244
Nothing.
So everything was good.

25:47.346 --> 25:49.680
So I said, you know what?
I'm a bad bitch.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.815
I'm not gonna [bleep] sit
here and going back and forth.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.651
He's not asking me
to go chill with him,

25:53.753 --> 25:55.753
I'm gonna do my thing and do me.
I got dressed.

25:55.855 --> 25:59.723
Before I walked out the door,
my phone goes ding.

25:59.825 --> 26:01.825
So I look at my phone
and I sit down

26:01.928 --> 26:03.827
and it was my
mother [bleep] Twitter.

26:03.930 --> 26:06.096
I look and it's a picture
of him naked on the bed.

26:06.198 --> 26:08.032
Rent "masseusers" --

26:08.134 --> 26:10.301
- I do do massage,
and I do it naked.

26:10.403 --> 26:12.670
Um, so, that's what it is.
I am not an escort.

26:12.772 --> 26:16.206
But also, I do not shame escorts
or anybody in porn.

26:16.309 --> 26:17.641
I think porn is awesome.

26:17.743 --> 26:20.578
- He told me he was a digital--
He was in digital marketing.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.513
So now I found out what
digital marketing was.

26:22.615 --> 26:24.415
- Well, he's
marketing something.

26:24.517 --> 26:25.583
- He's marketing that [bleep].

26:25.685 --> 26:26.984
- I also do graphic design.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.119
- Jozea, do you think you
could ever trust Rob again?

26:29.221 --> 26:31.422
- How can you trust somebody
when you constantly ask them

26:31.524 --> 26:34.091
over and over, "Hey,
did you do this?"

26:34.193 --> 26:35.893
I sent him so many messages.

26:35.995 --> 26:38.529
"Was this you?
Are you sure? Are you sure?"

26:38.631 --> 26:40.331
"No, this is not me.
This is not me."

26:40.433 --> 26:42.533
- I think we probably
have different stories.

26:42.635 --> 26:44.168
- I mean, it is what it is.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.869
Can we pull it up?

26:45.972 --> 26:47.304
Pull it up!

26:47.406 --> 26:48.706
- [siren wails]

26:48.808 --> 26:50.541
- [indistinct yelling]

26:50.643 --> 26:51.976
- [bleep].

26:52.078 --> 26:54.411
- Y'all know we got a message--
- They know what that means.

26:54.513 --> 26:56.080
- The most miserable sound.
- Alright.

26:56.182 --> 26:57.615
- Pull that bottle up, baby.

27:02.355 --> 27:04.054
- Jozea?
- What's up?

27:04.156 --> 27:06.290
- JUSTINA: "The message in the
bottle isn't the only surprise

27:06.392 --> 27:07.691
"we brought from Malibu.

27:07.793 --> 27:10.861
"Real love doesn't lie,
even under pressure.

27:10.963 --> 27:14.431
To help you get to the truth,
we've brought the lie detector."

27:14.533 --> 27:16.800
- Bring it out!
Bring it out!

27:16.902 --> 27:18.168
Bright that mother [bleep] out!

27:18.270 --> 27:19.670
- Lie detectors today.

27:19.772 --> 27:21.305
- Bring that mother [bleep]
out right now!

27:21.407 --> 27:23.340
- Okay, Jozea?
- Bring that bitch out.

27:23.442 --> 27:26.377
- Jozea, do you want Rob to
take another lie detector test?

27:26.479 --> 27:27.578
- Oh, definitely.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.346
- Will the truth lead
them back together,

27:29.448 --> 27:31.782
or will Rob's deepest
secrets tear them apart?

27:31.884 --> 27:32.916
Find out next.

27:33.019 --> 27:37.287
- [cheers and applause]

27:37.390 --> 27:38.656
- Who you slept with?

27:38.758 --> 27:40.391
- I hope you didn't
get his checkbook wet,

27:40.493 --> 27:42.693
because he owes me money.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.462
- I'm in a love triangle?
What are you talking about?

27:45.564 --> 27:46.664
- [thunderclap]

27:49.635 --> 27:51.235
- ANNOUNCER: Welcome back
to the reunion.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.537
Rob's secret life
as a massage therapist

27:53.639 --> 27:55.739
rubbed Jozea the wrong way.

27:55.841 --> 27:58.976
Good thing we have
a lie detector handy.

27:59.078 --> 28:02.446
- Jozea, the floor
is yours, my brother.

28:02.548 --> 28:03.781
- Y'all ready to hear the truth?

28:03.883 --> 28:05.182
- [cheers and applause]

28:05.284 --> 28:07.484
- Alright, let's make
this [bleep] happen.

28:07.586 --> 28:10.888
Question number one,
"Do you still love me?"

28:10.990 --> 28:12.890
- [cricket chirps]

28:12.992 --> 28:14.958
- Of course, I'll
always love you.

28:15.061 --> 28:16.226
- Aww!

28:16.328 --> 28:18.028
- [applause]
- Robbie!

28:18.130 --> 28:19.797
- "You sent me nude photos.

28:19.899 --> 28:23.400
Have you sent those
pictures to anyone else?"

28:23.502 --> 28:25.335
- No.

28:25.438 --> 28:26.737
No.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.138
- You know you're lying, Rob.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.207
Whenever you have good nudie,
you send it out to everyone.

28:30.309 --> 28:31.675
- ROB: I plead the fifth.

28:31.777 --> 28:34.178
- "Did you cheat on me
after we left the show?"

28:34.280 --> 28:36.380
- Yes.
- Right.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.415
- Who the [bleep] you
cheated on me with?

28:38.517 --> 28:39.750
I'm not playing with you.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.118
Bitch, I'm not [bleep].

28:41.220 --> 28:42.720
I'm not taking [bleep] nothing.

28:42.822 --> 28:44.254
Who the [bleep] you
cheated on me with?

28:44.356 --> 28:46.490
- If you want to address
me like an adult--

28:46.592 --> 28:47.891
- Jozea, please sit down, babe.

28:47.993 --> 28:49.293
Thank you.
- Who you slept with?!

28:49.395 --> 28:50.861
- I didn't say I
slept with somebody.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.262
I kissed somebody else.
- Who?

28:52.364 --> 28:53.897
- It was a drunk kiss.
- Who?

28:53.999 --> 28:55.332
- It was a friend.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.735
- Who [bleep] your friend?
- ROB: I'm not gonna tell you.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.036
- That's alright.
You know what?

28:59.138 --> 29:00.237
I'm sorry about that.
It's alright.

29:00.339 --> 29:03.307
But you a punk-ass bitch.
I'm done this [bleep].

29:03.409 --> 29:06.543
- Rob, is there anything
about that you want to say?

29:06.645 --> 29:08.612
- I didn't want to come here.
I just said that.

29:08.714 --> 29:10.147
- If I'm being
honest, as the host,

29:10.249 --> 29:12.649
it's really sad to see
you guys fell, you know?

29:12.752 --> 29:14.418
- He cheated!
- From being on the show--

29:14.520 --> 29:17.121
- Are you over your ex?
- Finished. Finished.

29:17.223 --> 29:19.089
Finished. Done!
- Done, done.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.125
- Finished.
- Okay, I hear you.

29:21.227 --> 29:23.160
- Let's switch gears
to our next single.

29:23.262 --> 29:26.063
- ♪

29:26.165 --> 29:27.231
- My name is Angela.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.233
I am back, bitches!

29:29.335 --> 29:32.302
I'm here to save these boys from
the lame girls in this house.

29:32.404 --> 29:35.405
So don't act surprised when
I snatched up your man, okay?

29:35.508 --> 29:39.109
- ROMEO: Angela, what were you
looking for this time around?

29:39.211 --> 29:42.279
- Um, well the first thing, I
wanted to make sure I didn't do

29:42.381 --> 29:44.148
was hook up the first day

29:44.250 --> 29:45.883
and stay with that person
the entire time.

29:45.985 --> 29:48.218
I wanted to test the waters
and get to know everybody.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.187
That's why I took it really
slow with my relationships

29:50.289 --> 29:51.421
and I got to know people.

29:51.524 --> 29:54.191
I was here for love,
not to make friends.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.360
- ANNOUNCER: Last season,
Angela left the house

29:56.462 --> 29:58.562
with a tan and a man.

29:58.664 --> 30:00.164
But that relationship ended

30:00.266 --> 30:02.699
when she accused Tur'i
of stealing her money.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.001
- [ka-ching]

30:04.103 --> 30:05.936
- ANNOUNCER: When he appeared
on the beach this season,

30:06.038 --> 30:09.473
she was looking for
all his sand dollars.

30:09.575 --> 30:11.708
- Angela, what was
going through your head

30:11.811 --> 30:13.777
when you saw Tur'i show up?

30:13.879 --> 30:15.679
- That I hope he didn't
get his checkbook wet,

30:15.781 --> 30:18.215
because he owes me money.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.384
And where is he at today?
Did he miss the bus?

30:20.486 --> 30:22.586
Does his bus pass not
take him this far?

30:22.688 --> 30:23.754
Where you at, though?

30:23.856 --> 30:25.656
Where is he? Bum!

30:25.758 --> 30:26.790
- JUSTINA: Huh!

30:26.892 --> 30:29.026
So break down this
money situation for us.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.929
What does he owe you for what?
- He owes me a few thousand.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.530
He stole money directly
from my PayPal.

30:33.632 --> 30:35.966
He was in charge of transferring
money from my PayPal

30:36.068 --> 30:37.935
to my bank account when
I was filming "The Challenge."

30:38.037 --> 30:40.237
And instead, he transferred
it to his bank account

30:40.339 --> 30:43.173
and treated his damn self.
So he owes me a chunk of money.

30:43.275 --> 30:45.275
And I broke it down
for him, and he's like,

30:45.377 --> 30:48.178
"Oh, give me two months and
I'll pay you back."

30:48.280 --> 30:50.180
Two months comes and goes.
I hit him up.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.415
I'm blocked on everything.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.116
He disappears
off the face of the earth.

30:53.219 --> 30:56.353
And the next time I see him
is the on the [bleep] beach.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.088
So of course I'm gonna be mad.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.224
Of course I'm gonna want to
knock him the [bleep] out.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.125
That's just how I am.
You owe me money, bitch.

31:02.228 --> 31:03.193
- Right.

31:03.295 --> 31:04.661
- He still
hasn't paid me back.

31:04.763 --> 31:06.864
- He explained it pretty
well on the beach, though.

31:06.966 --> 31:08.432
He said it was, like, 300 bucks,

31:08.534 --> 31:11.468
and she had said that
he was allotted that.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.370
Like, she told him he
could use it for expenses.

31:13.472 --> 31:14.972
- And Chad, shut the [bleep] up.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.473
Don't talk about me.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.075
- I'm just telling
you what Tur'i said.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.244
- It's not your place
to relay any message.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.346
Pipe down!
- I already did it, so--

31:22.448 --> 31:24.114
- Well, no one gives a [bleep].

31:24.216 --> 31:25.782
- JUSTINA: Alright, so
let's keep it moving.

31:25.885 --> 31:28.785
So we reached out to him
to see if he could send us

31:28.888 --> 31:31.188
a video message telling
his side of the story,

31:31.290 --> 31:34.558
and he chose not
to send a message.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.995
Now, we do have
a never-before-seen moment

31:38.097 --> 31:39.529
from his lie detector test.

31:39.632 --> 31:40.764
Who wants to see that?

31:40.866 --> 31:42.065
- GROUP: Me!

31:42.167 --> 31:43.467
- AUDIENCE: [applause]

31:43.569 --> 31:45.335
- Let's take a look.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.738
- Did you ever steal
money from Angela?

31:47.840 --> 31:49.873
- No.

31:49.975 --> 31:51.708
- Okay, well, we
have the results.

31:51.810 --> 31:54.578
Tur'i was asked if
he owes Angela money.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.079
He said no.

31:56.181 --> 31:58.782
The lie detector test said...

31:58.884 --> 31:59.783
that was a lie.

31:59.885 --> 32:01.151
- I [bleep] told you!

32:01.253 --> 32:03.654
I told everybody!

32:03.756 --> 32:06.423
- So if you could say
anything to Tur'i,

32:06.525 --> 32:09.660
look into that camera
and tell him.

32:09.762 --> 32:11.862
- I've said it before,
and I'll say it again--

32:11.964 --> 32:15.132
Run me my mother [bleep]
money, bitch.

32:15.234 --> 32:16.500
- [ka-ching]

32:16.602 --> 32:18.101
- That's all!
Run me my money!

32:18.203 --> 32:19.303
Run it! Run it!

32:19.405 --> 32:20.804
I don't want anything
to do with you.

32:20.906 --> 32:22.139
Just run me my
mother [bleep] money.

32:22.241 --> 32:24.608
- We'll dive into even more
drama when we come back.

32:24.710 --> 32:25.509
Don't go nowhere.

32:25.611 --> 32:26.510
- Uh-oh!

32:26.612 --> 32:27.744
- [applause]

32:27.846 --> 32:28.946
- Hey, listen.

32:29.048 --> 32:30.547
We still have
the lie detector test here.

32:30.649 --> 32:31.915

He kissed me."

35:16.682 --> 35:18.215
That's why I call it
a sniper kiss,

- I did, like, a diagram
inside the booth.

35:26.391 --> 35:29.226
She obviously kissed him back,
so it was, like--

35:29.328 --> 35:32.262
- So Morgan, why did you lie
to Jay about the Cory kiss?

35:32.364 --> 35:34.297

what I thought was gonna help
and benefit me and possibly him

35:42.341 --> 35:45.675

up making it only worse.

35:45.777 --> 35:47.677
- Why did you guys break up?

35:47.779 --> 35:51.548
- As soon as I left
the "Ex on the Beach" house,

35:51.650 --> 35:54.384
three days later, I left
to go film "The Challenge."

35:54.486 --> 35:56.887
It took me going to
the middle of nowhere,

35:56.989 --> 36:00.390
sitting by myself in a desert,
and being like, "Okay,

36:00.492 --> 36:02.359
maybe I jumped into
things a little too soon."

36:02.461 --> 36:03.927
I care about Jay as a person.

36:04.029 --> 36:05.829
We were not meant to
be in a relationship.

36:05.931 --> 36:08.165
- Jay, are you pissed that
she never gave you a chance?

36:08.267 --> 36:10.000
- I was pissed
when we got out,

36:10.102 --> 36:11.735
because when we got out,
we had three days.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.171
And she was, like, all
about "The Challenge."

36:14.273 --> 36:15.772
And I was helping
her [bleep] pack.

36:15.874 --> 36:17.541
I was helping her train.
She was stressed out.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.643
I was de-stressing her
as much as I could,

36:19.745 --> 36:21.645
and I was there for her
the whole time.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.313
And then she went
out on "The Challenge."

36:23.415 --> 36:24.748
Then the next
thing I know, like,

36:24.850 --> 36:27.284
I get a phone call from
her sister, like, "Oh, yeah, uh,

36:27.386 --> 36:29.286
"Morgan's on a two-week
vacation with Johnny Bananas,

36:29.388 --> 36:31.188
so now you're kind of
in a love triangle."

36:31.290 --> 36:32.822
I'm like, "What the [bleep]?

36:32.925 --> 36:35.025
I'm in a love triangle?
What are you talking about?"

36:35.127 --> 36:38.295
- At what point did you
tell Jay that it was over?

36:38.397 --> 36:39.696
- Jay broke up with me.

36:39.798 --> 36:41.531
I got kicked out of

36:41.633 --> 36:43.099
"The Challenge" house
on October 29.

36:43.202 --> 36:44.734
November 2, I was about to leave

36:44.836 --> 36:46.503
to go to my next
country to travel.

36:46.605 --> 36:48.104
Jay called me.
He broke up with me.

36:48.207 --> 36:50.207
And that was that.
And then I said--

36:50.309 --> 36:52.642
- So at that point,
had you hooked up with Bananas?

36:52.744 --> 36:54.044
- No.

36:54.146 --> 36:56.313
- Jay, do you believe her?
- No.

36:56.415 --> 36:59.149
- There was no hooking up
with Johnny Bananas.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.284
I don't care what
anyone has to say.

37:01.386 --> 37:02.419
- JUSTINA: Jay, really quick.

37:02.521 --> 37:05.889
So you believe that
Morgan cheated on you.

37:05.991 --> 37:07.324
- Yeah, I think she did.

37:07.426 --> 37:09.693
I think she's just holding
it out so she doesn't hurt me

37:09.795 --> 37:11.595
because this is her kindhearted
thing that she always does,

37:11.697 --> 37:12.796
but I think she did.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.532
- Jay, I would own 100%
if I did cheat on you.

37:15.634 --> 37:18.735
I did not--I will give you the
timeline breakdown of it all.

37:18.837 --> 37:20.337
- I hit you up and I'm like,

37:20.439 --> 37:22.539
"Yo, who are you going on
this two week with?"

37:22.641 --> 37:24.341
Had you told me
"Oh, I'm going with Bananas,"

37:24.443 --> 37:26.142
I'd be like, cool, chill,
not a big deal.

37:26.245 --> 37:28.178
But you kept
everything a secret.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.814
And when you came back, you're
like, "Oh yeah, by the way,

37:30.916 --> 37:32.115
I'm with, like, Bananas now."

37:32.217 --> 37:34.184
And I'm like, "What the
[bleep] was all that about?"

37:34.286 --> 37:37.254
- Jay, listen, we still have
the lie detector test here.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.189
- Bam, let's go! Why not?

37:39.291 --> 37:41.591

under the test?

37:41.693 --> 37:43.560

Because--no.

a question for Angela.

38:42.254 --> 38:45.522
As someone who's been
on both "Ex on the Beach"

38:45.624 --> 38:46.956

38:47.059 --> 38:50.126

38:52.464 --> 38:53.496

charming, so yeah, I do--
