WEBVTT

00:04.263 --> 00:05.849
Last season
on "Future Man"...

00:05.850 --> 00:07.519
Whoo-ha-ha-ha!

00:07.520 --> 00:09.272
- Who are you people?
- The game is a recruitment

00:09.273 --> 00:10.776
and training tool
sent back in time.

00:10.777 --> 00:12.028
You're gonna help us
save the world.

00:12.029 --> 00:13.698
You're the savior.

00:13.699 --> 00:15.201
The mission is to stop him
from getting herpes,

00:15.202 --> 00:16.579
prevent him
from becoming a scientist,

00:16.580 --> 00:17.831
and then he never creates
the cure.

00:17.832 --> 00:19.334
I'm really sorry, sir.

00:19.335 --> 00:21.463
Sorry doesn't
re-swab those urethras.

00:21.464 --> 00:23.008
That's enough, Dr. Camillo.

00:23.009 --> 00:24.219
I'm sorry, Dr. Kronish.

00:24.220 --> 00:26.056
- Stu.
- Did I take your bench?

00:26.057 --> 00:27.851
- I'm--I'm sorry.
- No, Stu, it's me.

00:27.852 --> 00:29.772
What is going on
with this timeline?

00:29.773 --> 00:32.402
- Hey, hey, JFutz.
- You're home earls, bro.

00:32.403 --> 00:34.657
- My name is Jewish.
- That's the Kronitorium

00:34.658 --> 00:35.742
where the super-cure
was engineered.

00:35.743 --> 00:37.495
Where the Biotics were born.

00:37.496 --> 00:39.875
No, if someone's gonna kill
Kronish, it should be me.

00:39.876 --> 00:41.253
We'll never forget
what you did here.

00:41.254 --> 00:43.132
When that thing goes green,

00:43.133 --> 00:45.679
that means Kronish is dead and
the final charge has been set.

00:45.680 --> 00:47.432
Then, you guys get back
to the future

00:47.433 --> 00:49.854
and do not come back for me
no matter what.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.617
I did it!

00:56.618 --> 00:58.370
You did it, huh?

00:58.371 --> 01:01.418
I take it, no word
from your time-traveling pals?

01:01.419 --> 01:02.462
Some friends.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.904
- Oh, my gosh.
- I got you now.

01:35.905 --> 01:38.367
That's right.
Teach you to fuck with me again.

01:38.368 --> 01:40.747
Yeah, there you go.
Oh, yeah, you're struggling.

01:40.748 --> 01:42.751
I like that.
Just gives me more power.

01:42.752 --> 01:44.087
Take it.

01:44.088 --> 01:45.297
Come on.
That's right.

01:45.298 --> 01:47.135
There you go.
How's that feel?

01:47.136 --> 01:49.974
Yeah, shut that big mouth
once and for all.

01:49.975 --> 01:53.105
Tricked you with a
worm, you idiot.

01:53.106 --> 01:54.733
That's right.
I'm a man.

01:54.734 --> 01:56.779
You're a fish.
I live in a house.

01:56.780 --> 01:58.073
You live in a lake.

01:58.074 --> 01:59.660
There you go.
Stop fighting.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.831
Paul?

02:01.832 --> 02:04.753
Oh-ho-ho!
Joosh.

02:04.754 --> 02:06.966
You know,
this--this fishing game,

02:06.967 --> 02:08.595
this is one of the best fishing
games ever I ever played,

02:08.596 --> 02:11.391
and I've played
a shitload of fishing games.

02:11.392 --> 02:13.020
Not on my work time.
On my private time.

02:13.021 --> 02:14.189
You know,
I would never do anything

02:14.190 --> 02:15.609
while I'm working for you, sir.

02:15.610 --> 02:18.531
- Okay, cool.
- Uh, one question though.

02:18.532 --> 02:19.992
How am I here?

02:19.993 --> 02:22.831
The last thing I remember,
I was in prison,

02:22.832 --> 02:24.585
and there was this--
Big, flash of light, right?

02:24.586 --> 02:26.338
Wait, how do you know that?

02:28.384 --> 02:29.845
It happened again.

02:32.059 --> 02:33.978
What?

02:33.979 --> 02:35.649
Let's go over it
one more time.

02:35.650 --> 02:37.193
When you were in prison,

02:37.194 --> 02:38.863
you started seeing
these flashes of light,

02:38.864 --> 02:40.491
and, uh, having seizures.

02:40.492 --> 02:42.036
- Okay.
- Yeah, it was terrible.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.706
You know,
gave you complete memory loss.

02:43.707 --> 02:45.209
Doctor's figured out it was

02:45.210 --> 02:46.963
because of the nuts
in your prison food.

02:46.964 --> 02:48.257
Yeah, I mean,
I have a nut allergy,

02:48.258 --> 02:50.010
but it doesn't give me seizures.

02:50.011 --> 02:52.766
Well, you have too many nuts,
you shake like a maraca.

02:52.767 --> 02:54.269
So the prison had to decide

02:54.270 --> 02:55.939
whether or not
to hire you a private chef

02:55.940 --> 02:57.693
or send you home
under house arrest.

02:57.694 --> 02:59.320
But they figured, you know,

02:59.321 --> 03:00.907
hiring a private chef
for "The Krona-bomber,"

03:00.908 --> 03:02.828
that's a PR nightmare.
So they sent you home.

03:02.829 --> 03:04.414
And that wasn't
a PR nightmare?

03:04.415 --> 03:06.293
It's kind of like
a pick-your-poison thing.

03:06.294 --> 03:08.088
You know, 'cause now
you're eating nut-free meals,

03:08.089 --> 03:09.465
but occasionally, you'll see
these flashes of light,

03:09.466 --> 03:11.219
and then you'll
forget everything,

03:11.220 --> 03:12.806
and I gotta explain it to you,
and it's super boring.

03:12.807 --> 03:14.935
I've, like, told you this story,
like, 15 times.

03:17.567 --> 03:20.906
Okay, and--and you and Tracy
still work for me?

03:20.907 --> 03:24.203
No, yeah, Tracy had a problem
working for a terrorist.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.540
Me, not so much.

03:25.541 --> 03:26.959
As long as the checks clear,

03:26.960 --> 03:28.378
I'm your man, JFutz.

03:28.379 --> 03:30.008
Mmm.

03:32.930 --> 03:35.894
But if I'm on house arrest,

03:35.895 --> 03:37.814
why don't I have
an ankle bracelet on.

03:37.815 --> 03:40.027
I mean, what's to stop me
from just walking out the door?

03:42.992 --> 03:45.914
The bullet I'd put
in the back of your skull.

03:45.915 --> 03:47.668
Just kidding.

03:47.669 --> 03:49.922
I'd just pop your knee
clean out.

03:51.510 --> 03:53.763
Paulie, is he seizing up again?

03:53.764 --> 03:55.809
Yeah, we got a regular
Lucy Whitmore over here.

03:55.810 --> 03:58.271
That's a character portrayed
by Drew Barrymore

03:58.272 --> 04:00.442
in the film "50 First Dates."

04:00.443 --> 04:01.737
Please don't tell me
you forgot that.

04:01.738 --> 04:03.365
So you're...

04:03.366 --> 04:06.079
- like, my personal guard now?
- Bingo.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.543
Whoa, "Vermont Fishing Hole."

04:08.544 --> 04:10.547
Hey, any nibbles, Paulie?

04:10.548 --> 04:12.592
Pull up a pole.
Find out yourself, my friend.

04:12.593 --> 04:15.264
- Wait, wait, hang on a second.
- That doesn't make any sense.

04:15.265 --> 04:18.353
Prisons have to deal with food
allergies on a daily basis.

04:18.354 --> 04:20.107
There must be
thousands of options

04:20.108 --> 04:21.694
that are--that are better
than sending me home.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.865
I'm a convicted terrorist.

04:23.866 --> 04:26.537
I was given 101
consecutive life sentences,

04:26.538 --> 04:29.250
and "USA Today" said that I was
the most hated man in America.

04:29.251 --> 04:31.212
Ooh, and the "New York Post"
dubbed you Little Boy Blue.

04:31.213 --> 04:33.175
B-L-E-W.

04:33.176 --> 04:34.845
'Cause you blew up the building.

04:34.846 --> 04:37.308
And you're small in stature.

04:46.410 --> 04:48.790
Okay, so the terrorist
gets the door.

05:03.529 --> 05:05.239
Oh, shit, peonies!

05:05.240 --> 05:06.617
I didn't know
they were in season.

05:06.618 --> 05:09.288
Neither did I.

05:09.289 --> 05:13.131
I'm gonna have to pick up some
of those for the widow Santiago.

05:15.426 --> 05:17.931
Stu Camillo?

05:17.932 --> 05:20.269
Stuart Gavin Camillo?

05:20.270 --> 05:21.981
- Ooh, who's that?
- Old flame?

05:21.982 --> 05:23.734
No, it's a guy that
I used to work with,

05:23.735 --> 05:26.239
but I have no idea
why he would send me flowers.

05:26.240 --> 05:29.412
Hmm, but why do you think
he might send you flowers?

05:29.413 --> 05:31.332
I don't know.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.921
I just thought
he always kind of hated me.

05:33.922 --> 05:37.428
- Objection.
- Speculation.

05:37.429 --> 05:39.516
- Let's get into the real.
- Yeah, hmm.

05:39.517 --> 05:40.935
Why does this guy hate you?

05:40.936 --> 05:42.814
I really don't know.

05:42.815 --> 05:44.192
He was just always a dick to me.

05:44.193 --> 05:46.154
- Really?
- For no reason?

05:46.155 --> 05:47.406
Wh--why do you care?

05:47.407 --> 05:48.784
Don't you find it curious

05:48.785 --> 05:50.997
that a man you considered
"a dick"

05:50.998 --> 05:53.920
would purchase this
tasteful floral arrangement?

05:53.921 --> 05:56.800
Clearly this isn't
a gas station impulse buy.

05:56.801 --> 05:58.721
Yeah,
these are Majorcan peonies.

05:58.722 --> 06:00.224
You know what the street value
of these are?

06:00.225 --> 06:01.560
- I don't.
- No.

06:01.561 --> 06:02.938
12.50 a bulb.

06:02.939 --> 06:05.317
Mm-hmm.

06:05.318 --> 06:08.156
I think I'm gonna go upstairs
and lie down a little.

06:08.157 --> 06:10.244
This is all just sort of--
Wait.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.916
Don't you wanna write him
a thank you note first?

06:12.917 --> 06:14.670
- What?
- Yeah.

06:14.671 --> 06:17.007
Etiquette dictates,
when someone sends you flowers,

06:17.008 --> 06:19.136
- you write them a thank you.
- Since when?

06:19.137 --> 06:20.723
Everyone knows
you gotta write a note

06:20.724 --> 06:22.560
before the last petal falls.

06:22.561 --> 06:24.648
I don't wanna say anything
to Stu.

06:24.649 --> 06:26.192
- Okay, fine, fine.
- I'll write it.

06:26.193 --> 06:27.821
"Dear Stu,

06:27.822 --> 06:31.787
thank you for the magnificent
Majorcan peonies."

06:31.788 --> 06:33.624
Now I'd like
to add something personal.

06:33.625 --> 06:35.878
Maybe, like, a little inside
joke that you and Stu share.

06:35.879 --> 06:37.590
- What would that be?
- What is the deal

06:37.591 --> 06:38.884
with you guys and Stu?

06:38.885 --> 06:40.722
I-I barely even knew the guy.

06:40.723 --> 06:42.892
- Whoa, hey.
- Calm down, man.

06:42.893 --> 06:44.938
- We're all friends here.
- Yeah.

06:44.939 --> 06:49.113
You're all getting defensive
about this Camillo fella.

06:49.114 --> 06:51.451
- What does he have on you?
- Or you on him?

06:51.452 --> 06:53.413
Nothing! I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about!

06:53.414 --> 06:55.292
Answer our questions
about Stu Camillo

06:55.293 --> 06:57.171
- and this will all be over.
- Stop.

06:57.172 --> 06:58.841
Stop!
Stop walking at me!

07:00.094 --> 07:01.513
- Sup.
- Hey.

07:01.514 --> 07:03.266
Die, resistance scum!

07:06.106 --> 07:07.776
- Who--
- Ninja star.

07:18.632 --> 07:20.425
I give that entrance...

07:20.426 --> 07:22.180
two stars.

07:28.652 --> 07:31.072
What the hell is happening,
guys?

07:31.073 --> 07:32.491
Skarsgaard and Paul
were Biotics?

07:32.492 --> 07:35.247
- I thought we saved the future.
- We did.

07:35.248 --> 07:36.667
It's the present
that's in danger.

07:36.668 --> 07:38.086
Your present.

07:38.087 --> 07:40.423
Nice pj's.
All right.

07:40.424 --> 07:42.427
Before we blew up
the Kronitorium,

07:42.428 --> 07:44.599
Biotics executed
murder protocol one.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.104
Oh, I don't like
how that sounds at all.

07:47.105 --> 07:48.941
Yeah, no, you shouldn't.

07:48.942 --> 07:50.778
They activated every Biotic
sleeper agent in the world

07:50.779 --> 07:52.239
for one singular mission.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.243
- Killing you.
- What?

07:54.244 --> 07:56.582
Wh-wh-why?
I'm being John Wicked?

07:56.583 --> 07:57.876
They must have
sent your picture out

07:57.877 --> 07:59.461
before we blew up the lab.

07:59.462 --> 08:01.925
Call it the last gasp
of a dying civilization.

08:01.926 --> 08:04.723
Okay, but--but the future
you guys went back to...?

08:04.724 --> 08:06.977
- Oh, it's perfect.
- Everything we dreamed of.

08:06.978 --> 08:08.731
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:08.732 --> 08:12.112
It's a utopia
inside of a paradise.

08:12.113 --> 08:13.741
We have robot butlers.

08:13.742 --> 08:15.452
- Tiger, that's--
- No, don't worry. Don't worry.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.289
Don't worry. They're programmed
not to turn on us.

08:17.290 --> 08:19.836
Wow.

08:19.837 --> 08:22.132
We--we saved the world.

08:22.133 --> 08:25.430
You know, when I was in prison,
I-I hoped against hope

08:25.431 --> 08:28.771
and--and it kept me going,
but...

08:28.772 --> 08:31.735
but knowing for sure...

08:31.736 --> 08:33.530
That makes everything
we went through worth it.

08:33.531 --> 08:34.866
Yeah.

08:36.411 --> 08:38.206
- Wait.
- If the future was perfect,

08:38.207 --> 08:40.418
then why--why'd you guys
come back for me?

08:40.419 --> 08:42.047
'Cause you were in trouble,
little buddy.

08:42.048 --> 08:43.842
We--we looked up
what happened to you.

08:43.843 --> 08:46.848
Oh, man, it was tough
livin' our lives

08:46.849 --> 08:49.270
knowing those two had killed you
so horrifically.

08:49.271 --> 08:51.440
Yeah, you see, first rule
of murder protocol one

08:51.441 --> 08:54.698
is to disrespect the body.
So...

08:54.699 --> 08:56.200
- Oh!
- Yeah.

08:56.201 --> 08:57.286
Mm.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.706
Where are my ears?

08:58.707 --> 09:00.292
Oh, no, they're right...

09:00.293 --> 09:01.795
- there--there they are.
- Yeah.

09:01.796 --> 09:03.549
Right inside that.

09:03.550 --> 09:05.218
- So...
- Oh, God. Okay.

09:05.219 --> 09:06.763
No teammate of ours
is gonna die like that.

09:06.764 --> 09:08.391
- No.
- No, no, no.

09:08.392 --> 09:11.105
- Thank you, guys.
- Hey, do you have any food?

09:11.106 --> 09:12.859
Yeah.

09:12.860 --> 09:15.906
Mmm, what the hell did you
do to these vegetables?

09:15.907 --> 09:17.660
I poached 'em in duck fat.

09:17.661 --> 09:19.496
Mmm.

09:19.497 --> 09:21.042
That was so good.

09:21.043 --> 09:22.879
I can't remember
the last time I had real food.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.799
Well, get used to it.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.887
I'm gonna be cooking like this
all the time.

09:26.888 --> 09:29.851
Using fresh local ingredients
wherever we go.

09:29.852 --> 09:31.605
Go?

09:31.606 --> 09:32.982
I mean, shouldn't I be, like,
laying low and hiding out

09:32.983 --> 09:34.360
if Biotics are hunting me?

09:34.361 --> 09:35.905
And wait for them
to come to us?

09:35.906 --> 09:37.491
Fuck no. We're bringing
the fight to them.

09:37.492 --> 09:39.621
Yeah, they're spread
all around the world.

09:39.622 --> 09:42.376
From the white sand beaches
of Rio de Janeiro

09:42.377 --> 09:44.380
to the Great Pyramids of Giza.

09:44.381 --> 09:47.720
We're gonna go
to all those places?

09:47.721 --> 09:49.098
How--how many sleepers are left?

09:49.099 --> 09:51.185
Well, after
this little episode, 12.

09:51.186 --> 09:54.024
Each in a location
more exotic than the last.

09:54.025 --> 09:56.697
You know,
I-I sort of just feel like

09:56.698 --> 09:58.491
bringing me to them
might be putting me

09:58.492 --> 10:00.203
in, like, unnecessary danger,
and...

10:00.204 --> 10:02.709
Well, that's where things
get real interesting.

10:02.710 --> 10:05.631
- Yeah.
- Because once you inject this,

10:05.632 --> 10:07.175
they'll be the ones in danger.

10:07.176 --> 10:08.804
CATG-6,

10:08.805 --> 10:10.975
aka Globyplast Nine,

10:10.976 --> 10:14.189
aka Super Serum 14.

10:14.190 --> 10:16.778
It's gonna make you faster,
smarter, stronger,

10:16.779 --> 10:18.448
and you'll be able to walk into
a room

10:18.449 --> 10:21.830
and feel instantly confident
no matter the situation.

10:21.831 --> 10:22.957
Oh, yeah.

10:22.958 --> 10:24.501
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:27.216 --> 10:28.886
This is awesome.

10:28.887 --> 10:31.182
Ha, this is incredible.
We're gonna be kicking ass

10:31.183 --> 10:33.060
side by side
just the three of us.

10:33.061 --> 10:34.689
- Well...
- Not exactly.

10:41.495 --> 10:43.039
Got the shield-sphere up.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.667
Should keep us
off their scanners for now.

10:44.668 --> 10:47.297
- They'll be four of us.
- Meet Fox, new tech expert.

10:47.298 --> 10:49.761
She may look like a nerd,
but you'll be glad to have her

10:49.762 --> 10:51.264
when she hacks
us into the Kremlin.

11:00.742 --> 11:03.037
- Hi.
- Futturman.

11:03.038 --> 11:04.916
Josh Futturman.

11:04.917 --> 11:06.837
Welcome to my time.

11:06.838 --> 11:09.258
With a little bit of luck,
maybe it'll become yours.

11:09.259 --> 11:10.970
I like the click
of your keyboard.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.892
But be careful, my spell check
doesn't miss a word.

11:13.893 --> 11:15.270
Oh, we'll have to

11:15.271 --> 11:16.857
antidisestablishmentarianism
that.

11:16.858 --> 11:19.571
- Serum's working.
- Instant chemistry.

11:19.572 --> 11:22.785
All right, I triangulated the
location of our first target.

11:22.786 --> 11:25.081
The ICEHOTEL in Helsinki.

11:25.082 --> 11:26.710
Ah, yeah,
I've always wanted to visit.

11:26.711 --> 11:29.089
Well, you better pack a parka
and a tuxedo.

11:29.090 --> 11:30.843
This is a shadow op.
Threat level nine.

11:30.844 --> 11:32.387
You two will be posing
as newlyweds

11:32.388 --> 11:34.141
infiltrating a Nordic sex cult.

11:34.142 --> 11:36.478
Murder protocol one dictates
to kill on sight.

11:36.479 --> 11:37.899
No questions asked.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.652
We're really gonna have
to sell newlyweds

11:39.653 --> 11:41.488
with insatiable
sexual appetites.

11:41.489 --> 11:44.036
Are you up for that?

11:44.037 --> 11:45.956
I mean, yes, I will try.

11:47.753 --> 11:50.381
Wait.
Did you say kill on sight,

11:50.382 --> 11:52.135
- no questions asked?
- Yeah.

11:52.136 --> 11:53.972
Because those two asked me
a bunch of questions.

11:53.973 --> 11:55.559
- What're you talking about?
- This whole morning,

11:55.560 --> 11:57.228
they could have just killed me,
and instead,

11:57.229 --> 11:58.649
they asked me a bunch of
questions about Stu Camillo.

11:58.650 --> 12:00.401
Why would they ask about Stu?

12:00.402 --> 12:02.573
I don't know, but they were
extremely persistent.

12:02.574 --> 12:04.577
- No, I don't like this one bit.
- What're they planning?

12:04.578 --> 12:06.497
If they're breaking MP1,
it must be important.

12:06.498 --> 12:08.292
Fox, hack into the Internet.

12:08.293 --> 12:10.338
Find out everything you can
about Stu Camillo.

12:10.339 --> 12:11.508
Already on it.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.768
You didn't tell 'em anything
important about Stu, did you?

12:16.769 --> 12:18.855
Oh, no, no, no, I don't know
anything important about Stu.

12:18.856 --> 12:20.693
- What does he have on you?
- Or you on him?

12:22.446 --> 12:24.785
- What does he have on you?
- Or you on him?

12:31.882 --> 12:33.593
- Uh, nothing.
- No, no, nothing.

12:33.594 --> 12:35.263
Um...

12:35.264 --> 12:37.308
but I did just remember that I--

12:37.309 --> 12:40.231
I think I have a Patagonia
gift card upstairs in my room,

12:40.232 --> 12:42.862
I'm gonna go grab it,
gear up for Helsinki.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.283
Back in a jiff.

12:45.284 --> 12:47.705
Okay, Futz.

12:47.706 --> 12:50.168
I know you got it somewhere.

12:59.688 --> 13:01.106
Spoink!

13:06.326 --> 13:08.287
What the fuck is happening?

13:13.173 --> 13:14.967
Oh, Josh, come on.

13:14.968 --> 13:17.097
We're finding all kinds of great
stuff here on the Internet.

13:17.098 --> 13:19.560
- Cool.
- Hey, um...

13:19.561 --> 13:21.355
you know,
I just thought of something

13:21.356 --> 13:23.735
that actually might be
really useful about Stu.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.531
Really, what?

13:25.532 --> 13:27.827
It was something that
you told me that he told you

13:27.828 --> 13:29.329
when you guys went on that date.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.793
Remember?
The whale watching date?

13:31.794 --> 13:33.839
Yeah, well,
he said a lot of things,

13:33.840 --> 13:35.551
so what specifically?

13:35.552 --> 13:37.470
Yeah, I can't remember.

13:37.471 --> 13:39.391
You said it was something that
was really, really important,

13:39.392 --> 13:42.857
and he told you right before
the humpback charged your boat.

13:42.858 --> 13:44.442
Well, to be honest,
after I saw that angry spout,

13:44.443 --> 13:45.988
- it just all went blank.
- Wrong.

13:45.989 --> 13:48.200
You've never seen a spout.

13:48.201 --> 13:50.288
You are never this nice to me.

13:50.289 --> 13:51.791
And you?

13:51.792 --> 13:53.628
You're Spoink girl.

13:53.629 --> 13:56.300
What the fuck is going on?
Somebody give me some answers.

13:56.301 --> 13:58.053
This will all be over soon.

13:58.054 --> 14:00.099
Just tell us why you would be
a threat to Stu Camillo?

14:00.100 --> 14:03.147
- You must know his weakness.
- Some of his secrets?

14:03.148 --> 14:05.318
I don't know anything
about Stu Camillo, okay?

14:05.319 --> 14:07.322
He's a tertiary character
in my life.

14:07.323 --> 14:09.117
- Tell us!
- He's tertiary!

14:09.118 --> 14:11.288
- God damn it!
- Start talking.

14:11.289 --> 14:12.625
- Now!
- He's tertiar--

14:12.626 --> 14:17.050
he's tertiary!

14:40.013 --> 14:41.724
I told you not to repeat
the question sequencing.

14:41.725 --> 14:43.227
You made him suspicious.
Geez, you're worse than Hera.

14:43.228 --> 14:44.479
- Don't compare me to Hera.
- Too late.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.899
I already did.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.485
How long until
the simulation reboots?

14:47.486 --> 14:48.989
- I don't know.
- He glitched the whole thing.

14:48.990 --> 14:50.617
- Glitched it?
- He crashed it.

14:54.041 --> 14:55.794
Oh, shit.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.923
We're gonna need Apollo.

15:30.782 --> 15:32.408
It's okay.

15:32.409 --> 15:34.830
You're safe now.

15:34.831 --> 15:36.458
Let me get this neuro-cap
off you.

15:36.459 --> 15:37.920
You'll be
a lot more comfortable.

15:37.921 --> 15:40.341
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

15:42.972 --> 15:44.850
What the hell was that?
Where am I?

15:44.851 --> 15:46.646
That was a simulation

15:46.647 --> 15:48.232
crafted from
your own consciousness,

15:48.233 --> 15:51.823
but controlled
by outside operators.

15:51.824 --> 15:53.368
And you are in a cave.

15:57.292 --> 15:59.504
Don't squirm.

15:59.505 --> 16:02.093
It only makes
the cerebro-derm stickier.

16:06.185 --> 16:07.688
I-I-I can't--

16:07.689 --> 16:09.440
I can't remember coming here.

16:09.441 --> 16:12.029
We had to remove
a small portion of your memory

16:12.030 --> 16:14.284
so you would not suspect
you were in a sim.

16:18.794 --> 16:20.630
- Don't worry.
- It's just spinal fluid.

16:26.685 --> 16:28.771
There.
Good as new.

16:28.772 --> 16:32.696
- No, bad.
- Bad. Still bad.

16:32.697 --> 16:34.992
Who--who are you?

16:34.993 --> 16:37.038
What the fuck is going on?

16:37.039 --> 16:38.583
My name is Athena

16:38.584 --> 16:40.127
and I'm sorry
you had to go through that.

16:40.128 --> 16:42.381
I assure you,
it was for your own safety.

16:42.382 --> 16:44.344
The truth is so shocking,

16:44.345 --> 16:47.601
we felt a simulation was a more
humane way to ease you into it.

16:47.602 --> 16:50.608
I really think
you should lie down for this.

16:52.236 --> 16:54.865
Just come on.

16:54.866 --> 16:56.494
Okay.

16:58.666 --> 17:01.211
I am from the future.

17:02.548 --> 17:04.134
And...

17:07.266 --> 17:09.394
Okay.

17:09.395 --> 17:12.191
My comrades and I traveled
back in time to find you

17:12.192 --> 17:13.903
because we believe you may be

17:13.904 --> 17:17.159
the only person with the skills
to save our world.

17:17.160 --> 17:20.499
A savior.
I know, it boggles the mind.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.295
But you must believe me.

17:22.296 --> 17:25.552
In 2026,
Dr. Stu Camillo will create

17:25.553 --> 17:27.430
a super-cure for all diseases,

17:27.431 --> 17:29.267
leading to a global war...

17:29.268 --> 17:31.772
between the ones who receive
the cure and the ones who don't?

17:31.773 --> 17:33.233
Well, yes, exactly,
but there's no way

17:33.234 --> 17:34.737
you could possibly know that.

17:34.738 --> 17:38.285
Yeah, I know it
because I lived it.

17:38.286 --> 17:40.915
God damn it.
It didn't work.

17:40.916 --> 17:42.836
I don't understand.

17:46.052 --> 17:47.929
I fought...

17:47.930 --> 17:50.977
I struggled, I suffered,
I sacrificed,

17:50.978 --> 17:53.065
I saw a girl's head
get blown up in my face,

17:53.066 --> 17:55.695
and I end up
in the exact same place.

17:58.076 --> 18:01.247
Okay, so...
Stu is the new Kronish.

18:01.248 --> 18:04.253
Same shit,
different fucking timeline.

18:04.254 --> 18:06.174
So you're a Time Warrior?

18:10.016 --> 18:12.353
Yeah.

18:12.354 --> 18:13.856
Yeah,
I guess you could say that.

18:13.857 --> 18:16.737
Then you know
the stakes we face.

18:16.738 --> 18:18.866
The fate of humanity
is in the balance.

18:18.867 --> 18:22.415
- We need you.
- No.

18:22.416 --> 18:24.085
You know, after spending a year

18:24.086 --> 18:26.966
in the prison
for the criminally insane...

18:26.967 --> 18:29.973
for apparently no reason...

18:31.643 --> 18:33.395
I don't really feel like
being a savior anymore.

18:35.693 --> 18:37.571
I've upset you.

18:37.572 --> 18:40.117
That's the last thing
I wanted to do.

18:40.118 --> 18:42.122
Rest.

18:57.779 --> 18:59.740
Seriously?

18:59.741 --> 19:01.869
Great way to treat your savior.
Thank you.

19:17.944 --> 19:20.907
Here.
Eat something.

19:20.908 --> 19:22.409
I'm not hungry.

19:22.410 --> 19:24.205
Being in the sim
cranks your metabolism

19:24.206 --> 19:26.042
14.6 times normal.

19:26.043 --> 19:27.419
You're in a caloric freefall,

19:27.420 --> 19:29.675
you risk
hypo-auto-cannibalization.

19:29.676 --> 19:31.512
- Oh, all right.
- How about this?

19:31.513 --> 19:33.683
How about I start
by gnawing on my fucking leg?

19:33.684 --> 19:35.728
Why am I shackled to the bed?

19:35.729 --> 19:37.439
The restraint
is for your safety.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.445
I once saw a man
flail so violently

19:40.446 --> 19:42.324
from post-sim hallucinations,

19:42.325 --> 19:44.245
he shattered his femur.

19:44.246 --> 19:46.584
The jagged bone ripped right
through the meat of his thigh.

19:46.585 --> 19:49.006
- All right, fine.
- Just leave it on.

19:51.595 --> 19:53.430
Easy on the liquids.

19:53.431 --> 19:57.146
The tranq we gave you can lead
to bladder control issues.

19:57.147 --> 19:59.108
I play a lot of video games,
okay.

19:59.109 --> 20:02.156
- I have no problem holding my U.
- Understood.

20:02.157 --> 20:03.993
You know,
putting me in that sim

20:03.994 --> 20:05.955
and making me think that I'd
saved the world was pretty mean.

20:05.956 --> 20:07.876
We didn't make you think
you saved the world.

20:07.877 --> 20:10.505
That part was a projection
of your own subconscious.

20:10.506 --> 20:12.510
All we controlled
were the questions about Stu.

20:12.511 --> 20:14.180
- You filled in the rest.
- So you--

20:14.181 --> 20:15.642
you hijacked my brain

20:15.643 --> 20:17.311
just to ask me questions
about Stu Camillo?

20:17.312 --> 20:20.568
Yes, but the simulation
told us so much more.

20:20.569 --> 20:23.448
We thought
it was something you knew.

20:23.449 --> 20:25.327
It turns out
it's something you are.

20:29.044 --> 20:30.588
What am I?

20:30.589 --> 20:32.341
That's what we're
here to find out.

20:32.342 --> 20:36.684
There's a power in you greater
than any we've ever seen.

20:36.685 --> 20:38.646
Like--like, a super power?

20:38.647 --> 20:40.525
Exactly.

20:40.526 --> 20:42.319
Now, I understand
you've been through

20:42.320 --> 20:43.864
something like this before,

20:43.865 --> 20:46.620
and I know why you're hesitant
to try it again,

20:46.621 --> 20:48.958
but if you'll join us,
I promise you,

20:48.959 --> 20:50.293
it'll be different this time.

20:50.294 --> 20:52.757
You won't end up behind bars.

20:52.758 --> 20:55.513
You'll end up
in the history books

20:55.514 --> 20:59.104
as the greatest hero
the world has ever known.

21:00.733 --> 21:02.652
- And if I say no?
- We'll wipe your memory

21:02.653 --> 21:04.030
and put you
right back in prison.

21:04.031 --> 21:05.867
- You can do that?
- Of course.

21:05.868 --> 21:07.537
The only side effect would be

21:07.538 --> 21:09.624
the lingering sensation
that something was off,

21:09.625 --> 21:11.502
but you would never really
be able to tell what it was.

21:11.503 --> 21:13.423
It would just be there
gnawing at you,

21:13.424 --> 21:15.469
never more than a shadow.

21:15.470 --> 21:17.181
That--that sounds like
it would drive me insane.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.191
Okay.

21:22.192 --> 21:23.903
Okay, if I do this,

21:23.904 --> 21:26.575
it is not to make it
into the history books.

21:26.576 --> 21:30.290
It's to make sure there's still
a history to be written about.

21:30.291 --> 21:32.754
Inside of history books.

21:32.755 --> 21:34.800
Well said, Joosh.

21:34.801 --> 21:39.183
So, does that mean you're in?

21:39.184 --> 21:41.522
Call me Josh.

21:41.523 --> 21:42.774
I'm in.

21:42.775 --> 21:45.403
Welcome to the Pointed Circle.

21:45.404 --> 21:47.407
- Pointed Circle.
- That's a cool name.

21:47.408 --> 21:49.203
Oh, that also...

21:49.204 --> 21:52.585
explains the,
uh, pointed circle.

21:52.586 --> 21:54.673
Yeah.

21:54.674 --> 21:57.136
There are some others who are
going to want to meet you:

21:57.137 --> 22:00.267
- Odin, Vishnu, Muluku, Xenu.
- Yeah, I, uh, would love

22:00.268 --> 22:01.895
to meet the--the whole--
the whole gang.

22:01.896 --> 22:03.398
And as a member
of the Pointed Circle,

22:03.399 --> 22:04.860
you'll need a code name as well.

22:04.861 --> 22:06.822
Okay.

22:06.823 --> 22:08.450
How does Jesus sound to you?

22:10.664 --> 22:11.874
It's a little risky.

22:11.875 --> 22:14.003
Mm, Allah?

22:14.004 --> 22:16.090
- Yeah, Jesus is fine.
- Good.

22:16.091 --> 22:17.384
Eat your supper.

22:17.385 --> 22:18.889
I'll return soon
with the others.

22:30.537 --> 22:32.916
Oh.

22:32.917 --> 22:34.669
Oh, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

22:34.670 --> 22:36.297
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

22:36.298 --> 22:38.803
Shit.
Shit.

22:39.847 --> 22:42.727
I can't meet Xenu like this.
This is disgusting.

22:44.982 --> 22:47.069
Sheets.

23:25.522 --> 23:27.149
Joosh is on board.

23:27.150 --> 23:30.698
We need all techs working on
an upload machine.

23:30.699 --> 23:32.367
You're so convinced
this'll work,

23:32.368 --> 23:35.040
but how do you know
he's the one?

23:35.041 --> 23:36.500
He crashed the simulation

23:36.501 --> 23:38.338
in less than ten minutes.

23:38.339 --> 23:41.052
We harness that power and use it
to bring down the entire system,

23:41.053 --> 23:42.930
- then we strike.
- The attack is on Launch Day.

23:42.931 --> 23:44.893
We'll need to weaponize him
before then.

23:44.894 --> 23:46.688
It'll take some time to
replicate the induction cortex.

23:46.689 --> 23:48.066
You'll have to keep him calm
till then.

23:48.067 --> 23:50.278
- That won't be a problem.
- Okay.

23:50.279 --> 23:52.491
'Cause this procedure
will 100% kill him.

23:52.492 --> 23:54.119
- "Kill him"?
- Soldiers die

23:54.120 --> 23:56.082
for lesser causes.
His death will be the first,

23:56.083 --> 23:59.129
but it won't be the last.
A war is coming.

23:59.130 --> 24:01.342
It's time we took back control.

24:09.317 --> 24:10.611
- Oh, God.
- They're gonna kill me.

24:20.924 --> 24:24.305
Lefty-loosey, righty-tighty,
lefty-loosey.

24:25.976 --> 24:28.104
Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.

24:39.461 --> 24:41.422
Nighty-night.

24:52.195 --> 24:53.990
You left the door open?

24:58.207 --> 24:59.291
When they ripped out
your tongue,

24:59.292 --> 25:00.794
did they get your brain too?

25:00.795 --> 25:02.840
You know what?

25:02.841 --> 25:04.468
Don't.
Spread out.

25:04.469 --> 25:06.848
Search the halls.
He can't have gotten far.

25:06.849 --> 25:08.309
Achilles will hear of this.

25:11.316 --> 25:13.904
Jesus.

25:38.997 --> 25:40.958
God it stinks in here.

25:40.959 --> 25:42.670
Yeah, I know.
This cave is nasty.

25:42.671 --> 25:44.549
I don't like it.

25:44.550 --> 25:47.053
You know last week, I caught
Apollo pissing in that corner?

25:47.054 --> 25:49.642
I do not let him near me.

26:10.769 --> 26:12.188
TTD.

26:21.999 --> 26:24.671
Did you hear that?
Osiris, Ganesh, check that out.

26:51.600 --> 26:53.437
Hachi machi.
