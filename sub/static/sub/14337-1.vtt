18:55.635 --> 18:57.719

Won't you go away?

18:57.804 --> 18:59.429
Won't you trust me,
just for tonight?

18:59.514 --> 19:00.722

l'm sorry, Doctor,
but l insist.

21:09.685 --> 21:10.852
Please.

21:16.734 --> 21:20.987
Dr. Waldman,
l learned a great deal
from you at the university

21:21.072 --> 21:24.199
about the violet ray,
the ultraviolet ray,

21:24.533 --> 21:27.911
which you said was
the highest color
in the spectrum.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.205
You were wrong.

21:31.374 --> 21:34.960
Here in this machinery,
l have gone beyond that.

21:37.546 --> 21:42.092
l have discovered
the great ray that first
brought life into the world.

21:42.218 --> 21:44.135
Oh. And your proof?

21:44.971 --> 21:47.430
Tonight you shall
have your proof.

21:49.392 --> 21:52.435
At first, l experimented
only with dead animals

21:52.895 --> 21:56.898
and then a human heart,
which l kept beating
for three weeks.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.275
But now,

22:00.069 --> 22:03.238
l'm going to turn
that ray on that body

22:03.489 --> 22:05.407
and endow it with life.

22:05.908 --> 22:09.452
And you really believe
that you can bring
life to the dead?

22:10.329 --> 22:12.497
That body is not dead.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.582
lt has never lived.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.252
l created it.

22:17.628 --> 22:21.548
l made it with my own hands
from the bodies
l took from graves,

22:21.632 --> 22:23.758
from the gallows, anywhere!

22:27.096 --> 22:28.805

to look beyond
the clouds and the stars,

28:52.439 --> 28:55.149

the trees to bud,

28:55.526 --> 28:58.319

a darkness into light?
