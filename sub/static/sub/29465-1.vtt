Hey!

02:04.792 --> 02:06.460
How long you been at it?

02:07.586 --> 02:09.045
An hour?

02:11.215 --> 02:12.591
Did you get anything done?

02:14.051 --> 02:15.928
Does it look like it?

02:17.388 --> 02:18.973
Well...

02:19.014 --> 02:20.933
I mean... I don't know.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.560
There could have been, like,

02:22.601 --> 02:24.603
incremental progress
or something?

02:26.480 --> 02:27.481
Shit...

02:27.565 --> 02:28.691
Shit.

02:29.024 --> 02:31.610
I gotta be out of here in 20 minutes.
Shit.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.989
Oh, hey, are you still going to...
you still want to give me a ride?

02:35.114 --> 02:36.448
Not really.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.326
C'mon, are you serious?

02:39.368 --> 02:41.412
You said you were going
to give me a ride, c'mon.

02:41.453 --> 02:42.913
C'mon. Please?

02:42.955 --> 02:44.790
It's like, right on the way.

02:44.832 --> 02:45.958
Don't make me take the bus.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.543
Fine.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.879
15 fucking minutes then.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.839
I'll be ready in 10.

02:53.257 --> 02:55.509
You're a real piece of shit,
you know that?

02:55.551 --> 02:58.262
God, I told you
15 fucking minutes.

02:58.304 --> 03:00.639
Dude! You've totally fucked me!

03:00.681 --> 03:02.850
I said I was sorry, Dez.
Jesus Christ.

03:02.892 --> 03:04.685
Sorry's not going to
get me there on time.

03:04.727 --> 03:05.728
You know what would?

03:05.769 --> 03:07.729
Making your freeloading'
ass take a cab.

03:07.730 --> 03:08.748
But I'm not going to do that.

03:08.772 --> 03:09.875
- You want to know why?
- Why?

03:09.899 --> 03:11.817
'Cause I'm not a fucking
asshole like you.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.420
Yeah? Well, you're
starting to sound like one.

03:13.444 --> 03:14.778
<i>Dezzy!</i>

03:15.696 --> 03:17.573
<i>You trying to dodge me?
It's been two weeks</i>

03:17.615 --> 03:21.118
and I need that fucking rent money.
I'm not running a shelter here.

03:21.202 --> 03:22.203
I'm running a business,

03:22.244 --> 03:23.305
and there are people over me

03:23.329 --> 03:24.848
who are telling me that
I have to have the money

03:24.872 --> 03:26.248
in for everyone in the building.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.626
Lance, Lance, listen to me.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.628
Dude, I'm on my way to
my fuckin' agent right now

03:30.669 --> 03:32.004
to pick up my commission check.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.757
It's two weeks late
getting to me, alright?

03:34.798 --> 03:37.301
So they're fucking me,
by default I'm fucking you,

03:37.343 --> 03:38.552
and we're all fucking fucked.

03:38.594 --> 03:39.845
I'm fuckin' sorry, dude.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.931
I know that it's shitty
but just, like,

03:41.972 --> 03:43.641
come by later tonight,
we'll settle up.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.434
- Is that cool?
- I'm asleep late tonight.

03:45.476 --> 03:47.269
Alright, well,
then tomorrow morning.

03:47.311 --> 03:48.705
I'm going upstate
for my sister's birthday.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.273
Alright, then
fucking Monday then, man!

03:51.357 --> 03:52.483
Work with me!

03:52.524 --> 03:55.653
That's a three day
extension, Dezzy.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.863
You better have a check
in my hand by Monday,

03:57.905 --> 03:59.365
you understand me?

03:59.406 --> 04:00.783
Yes.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.327
Like goddamn,

04:03.369 --> 04:05.621
you know that my anxiety
is through the fuckin' roof

04:05.663 --> 04:07.164
right now
and it's just, ya know...

04:08.374 --> 04:08.956
Listen.

04:08.958 --> 04:12.628
I try to be patient,
and to be kind to people,

04:12.670 --> 04:15.673
but really and truly
sometimes it's just, like...

04:17.507 --> 04:19.551
What the fuck?!

04:19.593 --> 04:20.678
You know what, darlin?

04:20.719 --> 04:22.221
I think you just need to

04:22.304 --> 04:26.392
chill out a little bit, you know?
Relax, everything is going to be fine.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.559
Yeah, "Chill the fuck out,

04:27.601 --> 04:29.019
this bitch is gonna be fine."

04:29.061 --> 04:30.812
You've been saying that
for three fuckin' months

04:30.813 --> 04:32.332
and that pot-bellied
motherfucker back there

04:32.356 --> 04:35.401
is about 3 days from
tossing me out on my ass.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.652
Yeah, well, guess what?

04:36.694 --> 04:38.904
If he throws you out,
no big deal,

04:38.946 --> 04:41.031
you can finally
come stay with me.

04:41.073 --> 04:43.033
You love it.
You're gonna love it.

04:43.075 --> 04:45.303
I mean, my fucking apartment
is about the size of the canvas

04:45.327 --> 04:47.204
you're working on right now.

04:48.122 --> 04:49.248
Get out of my car.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.833
Do you want to hit this?

04:50.874 --> 04:51.748
I'm takin' this!

04:51.750 --> 04:53.252
Thanks for the ride, babe.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.255
I'll call you later.

04:57.256 --> 04:59.091
You better call me later.

05:00.217 --> 05:01.719
<i>Yeah, yeah,</i>

05:01.760 --> 05:04.680
that's what you said about Maui,
too, you son of a bitch!

05:07.224 --> 05:08.535
Alright, look,
I have a client here

05:08.559 --> 05:11.270
so I'll just see you
tomorrow night, alright?

05:11.353 --> 05:13.480
Alright, bye-bye.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.149
Sorry about that.

05:15.691 --> 05:17.693
Look, have you talked
to Nikki St. Jean lately?

05:17.735 --> 05:18.861
Yeah, yeah, about that...

05:18.902 --> 05:20.696
I need a two week extension.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.615
That's what you told me
three weeks ago.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.534
I mean, c'mon,
you know how it is.

05:25.576 --> 05:27.328
But it's moving right along,
you know,

05:27.369 --> 05:29.038
it's coming out great.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.957
Nikki is pushing me
to drop your pieces.

05:31.999 --> 05:32.875
Drop my pieces?

05:32.876 --> 05:34.394
She hasn't even gotten
the new one yet!

05:34.418 --> 05:36.271
Well, she hasn't moved a
piece of yours in three months

05:36.295 --> 05:38.095
and that's when she was
expecting the new one.

05:38.130 --> 05:39.757
David, I'm going broke.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.216
I can't live off of nothing.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.302
And I can't live off of
ten percent of nothing.

05:44.428 --> 05:45.739
The piece is going
to get finished.

05:45.763 --> 05:46.805
Can I see your progress?

05:46.847 --> 05:48.140
You know I can't do that.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.933
Then how am I supposed
to convince St. Jean?

05:49.975 --> 05:52.019
You're my agent,
that's your job!

05:54.396 --> 05:56.023
Not anymore.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.485
You fuckin' droppin' me?

05:59.526 --> 06:01.570
Well, you're not
giving me a choice.

06:17.711 --> 06:18.921
<i>Hey, What's up?</i>

06:18.962 --> 06:19.963
<i>Fooled ya!</i>

06:20.005 --> 06:21.924
<i>It's Hadrian, leave a message.</i>

06:28.347 --> 06:31.767
Nikki St. Jean! Dezzy Donahue!

06:31.809 --> 06:34.103
You know, David and I
aren't working together anymore,

06:34.144 --> 06:36.479
so I don't know what the
fuck he's been telling you

06:36.480 --> 06:38.524
but the piece is gonna be ready,

06:38.607 --> 06:40.901
despite what you may have heard.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.778
Alright, call me back.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.580
- Dez!
- Hey.

06:53.622 --> 06:56.208
<i>- Shit, you're alive?</i>
- Yeah.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.753
Yeah, I'm alive
and fucking well.

06:59.795 --> 07:00.963
You holding?

07:01.004 --> 07:02.380
<i>It's been three months
since I hear from you</i>

07:02.381 --> 07:04.091
<i>and this is the hello I get?</i>

07:04.133 --> 07:05.134
<i>C'mon...</i>

07:05.175 --> 07:07.553
Hey, so are you holding or what?

07:07.594 --> 07:08.368
<i>Of course.</i>

07:08.470 --> 07:10.264
Alright,
I'll be there in a minute.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.877
Well, that was fucking quick.

07:42.629 --> 07:43.881
So you famous yet or what?

07:43.922 --> 07:45.591
Yeah, I should probably
sign your dick.

07:46.425 --> 07:47.843
Is that you, Dez?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.428
'Sup, Pops?

07:50.429 --> 07:52.181
You still making them pictures?

07:52.222 --> 07:53.891
Yeah, I'm still painting,

07:53.932 --> 07:56.143
you senile old fuck.

07:56.185 --> 07:58.437
Pictures, paintings,
same damn thing.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.353
Forgive the old man.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.914
He's about 6 months away
from being sent

08:00.939 --> 08:02.483
to the old folks home for good.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.610
The second you try that
I'm gonna put a bullet

08:04.651 --> 08:06.695
in my head and take you with me.

08:06.737 --> 08:07.779
Is this all you idiots do

08:07.821 --> 08:09.239
all goddamn day, every day?

08:09.281 --> 08:11.033
Hey, don't give me any shit.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.201
I didn't even say anything.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.203
Yeah, keep it that way, will ya?

08:14.244 --> 08:16.371
All you do is "yap yap yap"

08:16.413 --> 08:18.040
You keep running your mouth,

08:18.081 --> 08:20.292
you're going to be
running for your life.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.753
Your threats are almost
adorable, you know that?

08:22.794 --> 08:23.921
Blah, blah, blah.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.881
- Can we get that stuff?
- Yeah.

08:25.923 --> 08:27.674
I've got better things
to do today

08:27.716 --> 08:28.776
than listen to these assholes

08:28.800 --> 08:30.719
talk about their
disability checks.

08:30.761 --> 08:31.719
I work!

08:31.720 --> 08:32.594
Me, too!

08:32.596 --> 08:34.806
Don't get ahead of yourselves.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.034
You know, I've really
picked up my game

08:36.058 --> 08:37.893
since the last time I saw you.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.061
I've got some bomb-ass options.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.563
"Bomb-ass!"

08:41.605 --> 08:43.023
Hey, it sells with the kids!

08:43.106 --> 08:44.566
Alright.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.902
Alright, so...

08:47.778 --> 08:50.489
We've got Tennessee Black.

08:50.531 --> 08:51.758
This stuff is a little bit hazy,

08:51.782 --> 08:52.908
it's a little bit smokey,

08:52.950 --> 08:54.326
it's light on the visuals.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.577
Pass.

08:55.619 --> 08:56.787
Black Dynamite.

08:56.828 --> 08:57.620
This stuff is real strong,

08:57.621 --> 09:00.457
but it's the perfect combo
of supercharge

09:00.499 --> 09:02.292
and visual accentuation.

09:02.334 --> 09:04.253
The grooviest of nights
will follow.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.796
You rehearse this shit?

09:05.837 --> 09:07.214
Yeah, I do.

09:07.256 --> 09:08.423
Fuck yourself.

09:08.882 --> 09:09.798
What's up with that?

09:09.800 --> 09:11.176
Even I don't touch this shit.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.263
Well, maybe every once in awhile
but I don't mainline it.

09:14.304 --> 09:15.806
The shit's intense.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.575
It's the closest thing
they've got to a pure,

09:17.599 --> 09:20.686
uncut mix of cocaine and DMT.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.104
It's unreal.

09:23.188 --> 09:24.231
Yeah.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.941
Yeah, I'll take that.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.043
You want to try a bump first?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.318
I mean,

09:28.360 --> 09:29.754
I was going to buy it,
but I'll take a sample.

09:29.778 --> 09:31.363
Yeah, of course you will.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.783
Now, with this,
you've got to start slow.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.160
You do too much of this shit
and you're done for.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.138
Biggest thing with this batch
is you've got to find the exact

09:39.162 --> 09:41.206
right amount for your needs.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.709
So start small.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.797
Fine, not that small.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.426
Surprised to hear from you.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.551
You haven't been
gettin' your shit

09:53.552 --> 09:54.720
from anybody else, right?

09:54.761 --> 09:56.221
Nah, I've been clean.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.348
I haven't finished a painting
in three months.

10:00.434 --> 10:01.995
Well, look, you might
want to stick around

10:02.019 --> 10:03.895
for a minute after you try that.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.147
Shit could be bonkers.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.359
Oh, shit!

11:32.401 --> 11:34.236
Sorry, I thought this was
the bathroom.

11:56.591 --> 11:57.634
Dezzy!

11:57.676 --> 11:59.344
Courtney! Jesus Christ!

11:59.386 --> 12:01.012
You scared the shit out of me.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.681
How the fuck are you?

12:02.764 --> 12:04.141
I'm fine.

12:05.016 --> 12:07.060
You don't answer
your phone anymore?

12:07.102 --> 12:08.645
I've been calling you for weeks.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.354
I've been busy.
You know how it goes.

12:10.355 --> 12:11.690
Uh-huh.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.066
Ronnie was just right here.

12:13.108 --> 12:13.690
Hey, I've got to go.

12:13.692 --> 12:14.794
I've got some shit
to take care of.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.486
What? It's barely 11!

12:16.528 --> 12:18.864
Fuck me, are you still here?

12:18.905 --> 12:20.741
You didn't fucking listen to me!

12:20.782 --> 12:22.260
I think we just have
different definitions

12:22.284 --> 12:22.950
of the word "small."

12:22.951 --> 12:24.578
Yeah, it's good though, right?

12:24.619 --> 12:26.413
- I can't lie.
- Uh-huh.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.123
What? What are you
babbling about?

12:28.165 --> 12:30.250
I got the best fucking
Bliss in town.

12:30.292 --> 12:31.793
Knocked Dez here
flat on her ass.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.670
And you didn't even offer?

12:33.712 --> 12:35.046
I've gotta go home.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.675
I saw your new magazine
cover the other day,

12:38.717 --> 12:41.303
the blood punk thing.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.680
They hire me to do
three fuckin' covers, right?

12:43.722 --> 12:44.598
So I do them,

12:44.599 --> 12:46.641
and hand them all in
at the same time.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.561
This fucking bastard has
the audacity to tell me

12:49.603 --> 12:51.312
that "nudity is prohibited,"

12:51.313 --> 12:53.148
and he's not going to
give me my payments

12:53.231 --> 12:55.150
unless I change
the last two covers.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.359
Fuck you, dude!

12:57.319 --> 12:59.321
You should have told him
to screw months ago.

12:59.362 --> 13:00.882
And I told that
little weasel one better.

13:00.906 --> 13:02.491
I told him to get fucked.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.201
Six goddamn weeks later,

13:04.242 --> 13:07.329
walkin' by the news stand,
what the fuck do I see?

13:07.370 --> 13:09.372
My goddamn issue

13:09.414 --> 13:13.126
with a fuckin' tacky-ass
plastic slip cover

13:13.168 --> 13:15.170
covering up the tits and cock.

13:15.212 --> 13:18.173
Clyde, are you still
letting that one drag out?

13:18.215 --> 13:21.176
It's "Clive," and go screw.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.719
I knew it.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.014
And I called that motherfucker

13:26.056 --> 13:27.283
and I was trying to get
a meeting with him

13:27.307 --> 13:29.017
but he wouldn't fuckin'
take my call.

13:29.059 --> 13:31.228
Fuckin' weasley-ass
piece of shit.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.855
When I see him
and his spray-tanned mug,

13:33.897 --> 13:36.233
it's going to be
a bit of a situation.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.195
Seriously, when are you
going to cut him loose?

13:40.237 --> 13:40.779
I don't know.

13:40.780 --> 13:42.656
When something better
comes along.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.201
Brutal.

13:47.118 --> 13:49.329
You can't leave yet!
C'mon, one fucking shot!

13:56.169 --> 13:57.254
Look who I found.

13:57.295 --> 13:58.797
Dezzy!

14:03.051 --> 14:04.009
What about you
and fuckin' Ronnie?

14:04.010 --> 14:05.679
You all broke up, like, twice.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.514
You know how I am,
you know how he is.

14:07.556 --> 14:10.058
The motherfucker would
take a bullet for me.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.060
Plus, he's got a horsecock.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.271
Is that all you care about?

14:14.312 --> 14:16.189
I never saw you complaining.

14:17.148 --> 14:17.940
So...

14:17.941 --> 14:19.651
You going to his show
tomorrow night?

14:19.693 --> 14:20.425
Fuck no.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.195
You know Dante,
Ronnie's manager, exec,

14:22.237 --> 14:24.406
- I keep telling you about?
- No.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.092
Well, he's going to be there.
He owns two labels.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.993
I bet he could get you
some commission work.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.369
He's a big fan.

14:29.411 --> 14:31.788
I need to finish this piece!

14:31.830 --> 14:33.582
You need to get paid.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.211
Well, well, well.

14:38.253 --> 14:41.381
A tale as old as time itself.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.345
How long have you guys
been in here?

14:47.387 --> 14:50.015
- Too long.
- Not long enough.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.349
Dezzy decided to stay

14:51.391 --> 14:53.059
and hang out
a little while longer.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.227
Oh, yeah?

14:54.269 --> 14:56.313
If we can give her a reason to.

15:19.961 --> 15:23.798

20:56.297 --> 20:59.300

on the couch, Dez.</i>

20:59.342 --> 21:01.636
<i>Why, what's up? What's going on?</i>

21:02.470 --> 21:04.389
I started painting again.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.933
<i>Well, shit, Dez, that's great.</i>

21:12.647 --> 21:14.816
Something happened
to me last night.

21:14.899 --> 21:16.901
<i>What do you mean
something happened?</i>

21:16.943 --> 21:18.736
<i>What happened?</i>

21:18.778 --> 21:21.489
I mean, it's like...
I don't know.

21:21.531 --> 21:22.615
Something came over me

21:22.657 --> 21:24.826
and it all just started
pouring out of me.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.078
I don't even remember doing it.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.706
<i>Like you blacked out?</i>

21:30.456 --> 21:32.709
It's like I was possessed.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.670
<i>Well, that's good, right?</i>

21:36.963 --> 21:38.589
Yeah, it's great.

21:40.049 --> 21:42.343
It's going to be my masterpiece.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.139
<i>Well, what did you paint?</i>

22:46.074 --> 22:47.533
Fuck!

22:49.702 --> 22:51.829
Jesus, I'm out of shape!

22:54.415 --> 22:56.584
Yeah, sure, help yourself.

22:56.626 --> 22:58.169
Thank you.

23:00.755 --> 23:03.007
I saw your, uh...
I saw your painting in there.

23:03.758 --> 23:07.512
I saw your inspiration
all over the counter, too.

23:10.348 --> 23:11.682
What the fuck is your problem?!

23:11.724 --> 23:14.894
Hey, look, I'm just
making an observation.

23:14.936 --> 23:17.230
No, you're just talking shit.

23:17.313 --> 23:20.108
- I'm just having a conversation...
- Thanks for stopping by.

23:21.401 --> 23:23.277
What?

23:23.319 --> 23:25.405
Wait, are you kicking
me out already?

23:25.446 --> 23:27.031
C'mon.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.449
Alright, you know what?
Fine. Fine.

23:28.491 --> 23:29.802
You've got work to do,
that's fine.

23:29.826 --> 23:33.246
But how about one drink, huh?

23:33.287 --> 23:35.456
Loosen you up a little bit.

23:35.498 --> 23:37.125
C'mon.

23:48.136 --> 23:50.388
<i>C'mon, there's
a fucking line out here!</i>

24:01.691 --> 24:02.775
You cunt!

24:03.609 --> 24:05.403
Open your mouth again, bitch.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.253
Open your mouth, bitch,
I want to see it.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.281
Open your mouth.

24:08.322 --> 24:09.740
Break it up! Break it up!

24:09.782 --> 24:12.535
Tell this fuckin'
little groupie-ass bitch

24:12.577 --> 24:14.662
to keep her fucking mouth shut.

24:14.704 --> 24:15.536
I know it's really hard

24:15.538 --> 24:17.182
with all of the dicks
strutting around here

24:17.206 --> 24:19.750
but try to do your fucking best.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.669
Get your hands off of me!

24:21.711 --> 24:22.712
Fuck off!

24:22.753 --> 24:24.088
Hipster bitches.

24:30.386 --> 24:31.530
Hey, are you about ready to go?

24:31.554 --> 24:33.514
No, I'm fuckin' pissed!

24:33.556 --> 24:35.266
Fuckin' melon-headed ass skank

24:35.308 --> 24:36.642
was fuckin' pounding on the door

24:36.684 --> 24:38.019
and givin' me attitude.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.145
Thank you.

24:39.228 --> 24:41.105
Well, you were in there for,
like, 15 minutes.

24:41.189 --> 24:42.773
I don't give a shit.

24:43.608 --> 24:45.610
I'm just fuckin'
still fuckin' boiling

24:45.651 --> 24:47.945
from that cocksucker David.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.423
I've been with that
motherfucker 2 years

24:49.447 --> 24:52.366
and ever since my fucking career
has been in a shithole.

24:52.658 --> 24:53.910
I'm so sorry to bother you

24:53.951 --> 24:56.537
but you're Dezzy Donahue,
aren't you?

24:56.579 --> 24:58.289
No, man, sorry.

24:58.331 --> 25:00.374
Look, I have a custom print

25:00.416 --> 25:04.003
of your original
Splatter Punk #1 issue

25:04.045 --> 25:05.462
and it's one of my
most valued posses...

25:05.463 --> 25:06.463
Hey, can you just fuck off?

25:06.464 --> 25:08.257
I'm sorry, I'm not in the mood.

25:08.299 --> 25:10.009
Fuck you!

25:12.637 --> 25:14.180
Goddamn!

25:14.222 --> 25:16.057
That kid loved you.

25:16.098 --> 25:18.476
Why lie to him?

25:18.559 --> 25:20.686
I just don't want to deal
with it tonight.

25:24.106 --> 25:25.733
I think I'm going to have
one more drink.

25:25.775 --> 25:27.777
Oh, God.

25:29.153 --> 25:30.613
Look who's here.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.493
Second night in a row.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.078
Lucky you.

25:37.119 --> 25:38.871
What did you guys
get into last night?

25:38.913 --> 25:40.373
What'd you do?

25:40.414 --> 25:42.124
Each other.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.920
Wait, really?

25:45.962 --> 25:47.648
And she's got on this
tiny little black dress,

25:47.672 --> 25:49.799
and this thing is hot,
she rocks it real well.

25:49.840 --> 25:53.052
And she is all over me,
won't let it go,

25:53.094 --> 25:54.679
and Ronnie is into it, too.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.681
Well, she was good-looking.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.450
And this leads to that,
and before you know it,

25:58.474 --> 26:00.074
the three of us are in
the back of a cab,

26:00.101 --> 26:01.394
all over each other.

26:01.435 --> 26:03.646
Ronnie's getting a little
frisky with his hands...

26:05.481 --> 26:07.024
He starts rubbing it up her leg,

26:07.066 --> 26:08.442
going for the pie.

26:08.484 --> 26:10.695
But instead I find a tree trunk.

26:11.445 --> 26:13.281
Wait. What, she had a cock?

26:13.322 --> 26:15.074
Like my forearm.

26:15.950 --> 26:17.702
So what did you do?

26:19.161 --> 26:21.455
He stuck his dick
between those double Ds

26:21.497 --> 26:23.916
so fuckin' fast my goddamn
head was spinning!

26:23.958 --> 26:25.668
They looked good!
They looked fucking real!

26:25.710 --> 26:27.878
Hey, her dick felt good, too!

26:27.920 --> 26:29.422
Wow!

26:29.463 --> 26:30.798
You guys are ridiculous.

26:32.174 --> 26:33.926
Dez, you alive in there?

26:34.802 --> 26:36.679
Fuckin' barely.

26:36.721 --> 26:39.098
Liven up,
the night is still young.

26:39.140 --> 26:40.474
Nah, I gotta go home.

26:40.516 --> 26:41.743
I've been dickin'
around all night.

26:41.767 --> 26:42.725
I need to go paint.

26:42.727 --> 26:43.519
Nonsense.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.228
You're going to come
to The Fuzzy with us,

26:45.229 --> 26:46.397
have a handful of drinks,

26:46.480 --> 26:49.066
maybe snort a couple of lines,

26:49.108 --> 26:51.652
see a good band... maybe.

26:51.694 --> 26:54.905
And at least just
say hi to Dante,

26:54.947 --> 26:56.174
enough to set up
a meeting with him.

26:56.198 --> 26:58.242
Yeah. He's a good guy.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.619
Big fan.

27:01.412 --> 27:02.705
Dante?

27:02.747 --> 27:04.832
The record exec
I keep telling you about.

27:06.584 --> 27:09.754
Courtney, my darlin'.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.255
You love to fuckin' talk,

27:11.297 --> 27:13.215
but you don't fuckin' listen.

27:13.257 --> 27:16.344
I don't want to meet
a goddamn fuckin' suit

27:16.385 --> 27:20.097
named fuckin' "Douchebag Dante."

27:20.139 --> 27:23.351
Fuckin' suck my dick
and disappoint me.

27:23.392 --> 27:26.145
I am just trying
to get you paid.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.230
Pass.

27:29.899 --> 27:31.942
You guys really
aren't going to come?

27:32.485 --> 27:33.944
Fuck, no way.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.280
I'm crashin' but Dez
you should really go.

27:37.740 --> 27:39.241
Sounds fun.

27:39.283 --> 27:41.494
You know, meet Dante.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.999
These fuckin' dickholes
better not suck, dude.

27:47.041 --> 27:48.709
That is not the point!

27:48.751 --> 27:50.020
My girl Lexi is working tonight.

27:50.044 --> 27:50.876
She'll hook us up.

27:50.878 --> 27:52.004
Have you met her?

27:52.046 --> 27:53.214
I don't know.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.134
Hey!

27:57.176 --> 27:59.762
A couple of shots
and a beer for Ronnie.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.061
How've you been?

28:08.062 --> 28:10.356
I heard you had
a gallery opening!

28:10.439 --> 28:11.982
Yeah, tryin' to!

28:12.024 --> 28:14.110
Classic Donahue.

28:14.235 --> 28:17.071
Jesus Christ, Dezzy,
you're a fucking lush!

28:17.113 --> 28:19.532
What, I fucking hate small talk!

28:20.491 --> 28:22.034
Let's go find Ronnie, c'mon!

28:22.076 --> 28:23.285
Yeah.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.594
- Baby!
- Oh, that was fast!

28:40.636 --> 28:42.471
Fuck. Alright.

28:44.306 --> 28:45.683
How you feeling?

28:45.766 --> 28:47.101
I'm fuckin' great!

28:47.143 --> 28:48.644
Hey, do I look like an artist?

28:48.686 --> 28:50.186
Yeah. You look like
a fucking moron.

28:50.187 --> 28:52.815
Oh my God, are you in a band?

28:52.898 --> 28:54.066
Oh my God.

28:54.108 --> 28:55.502
Hey, do you want to meet
Dante or not?

28:55.526 --> 28:56.777
Yeah, fuck it, sure.

28:56.819 --> 28:58.904
Alright, fuck you,
give me a second.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.615
What? What? Shit.

29:01.657 --> 29:03.909
C'mon, give me a bump,
I'm fuckin' losing my shit.

29:03.951 --> 29:04.952
- Here?
- Yes.

29:05.828 --> 29:07.872
Alright, fine,
just keep it fuckin' low.

29:07.913 --> 29:08.974
I don't want any
of these fucking scabs

29:08.998 --> 29:11.125
trying to pry a bump
off me all night.

29:11.167 --> 29:13.002
- Here.
- No one fucking gives a shit.

29:13.043 --> 29:15.212
It'll probably get
you closer to Dante.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.047
The guy is the definition
of a vacuum.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.133
- Here, want some?
- Yeah.

29:20.384 --> 29:25.055
Well, well, well, Dezzy Donahue.

29:25.097 --> 29:28.058
If it ain't about damn time.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.894
Ever since I heard
about how well

29:29.935 --> 29:31.519
you guys were acquainted,

29:31.520 --> 29:33.773
I couldn't wait
to get introduced.

29:33.814 --> 29:35.858
Well, I don't know
why it took so goddamn long.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.610
You said that you
wouldn't be caught dead

29:37.651 --> 29:39.653
painting a cassette cover
for a room full of suits,

29:39.695 --> 29:41.113
remember?

29:41.155 --> 29:43.365
Kind of a bitch, isn't she?

29:43.407 --> 29:44.658
Want a sniff?

29:44.700 --> 29:46.660
Is it strong?

29:57.421 --> 29:59.924
Are you alright?

29:59.965 --> 30:01.842
No.

30:58.899 --> 31:01.485
I feel like I'm fuckin' dying.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.654
You're not going to die.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.323
Trust me.

31:31.015 --> 31:32.516
You feel better now?

31:52.244 --> 31:53.704
Can I help you?

34:15.888 --> 34:18.014
<i>N'</i>

34:54.259 --> 34:56.344
I'm coming!

35:00.140 --> 35:03.894
Jesus fucking Christ!

35:14.738 --> 35:15.989
Holy hell!

35:16.031 --> 35:18.325
You look like 10 pounds
of shit in a 5 pound bag.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.369
What the fuck do you want?

35:20.410 --> 35:21.620
Oh, well,

35:21.662 --> 35:23.014
I just came here
to talk to you about

35:23.038 --> 35:25.958
the 22 pieces you have
clogging up my gallery

35:25.999 --> 35:28.460
and the $10,000 advance
I paid you

35:28.502 --> 35:29.962
on a piece I'm never getting.

35:30.003 --> 35:31.213
You're getting your piece.

35:31.255 --> 35:32.714
That's not what
your agent told me.

35:32.756 --> 35:34.383
That's why he's not my agent.

35:34.424 --> 35:36.510
Don't fuck with me, Dez.

35:36.552 --> 35:38.178
Let me in.

35:41.890 --> 35:43.976
Is this the painting?

35:44.560 --> 35:46.103
Yep.

35:46.395 --> 35:47.622
That goddamn weasel of an agent

35:47.646 --> 35:49.690
told me that you didn't
have anything done.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.442
It'll be ready by launch.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.319
Wait, no, you think
you can finish this

35:54.361 --> 35:55.946
in three days?

35:55.988 --> 35:57.906
That was the plan.

35:58.532 --> 36:00.552
Look, Nikki, I can write you
a check for your advance

36:00.576 --> 36:02.256
that's going to bounce,
or you can trust me

36:02.286 --> 36:04.538
to give you what I said
I was going to give you.

36:05.998 --> 36:08.041
You have three days.

36:08.083 --> 36:09.877
Don't fuck me, Donahue.

36:09.918 --> 36:12.087
You know what happens
when you fuck me?

36:12.671 --> 36:14.882
Nobody comes?

36:18.135 --> 36:20.053
Just finish the painting.

38:56.710 --> 38:58.253
Hey, Courtney,
you need to call me back

38:58.295 --> 39:00.547
and tell me what the fuck
happened last night.

39:00.589 --> 39:03.258
I mean, I fuckin' wake up
covered in fuckin' blood,

39:03.300 --> 39:05.218
like, and I don't know
what the fuck happened.

39:05.260 --> 39:07.220
You were just tearing into
some scabnose

39:07.262 --> 39:09.681
in the bathroom, and then
all of a sudden, like...

39:09.723 --> 39:11.892
I feel like I'm
walking on water.

39:11.933 --> 39:14.478
I mean, this shit
ain't that good, is it?

39:16.146 --> 39:18.416
Okay, because, like, I can't
get this shit out of my head,

39:18.440 --> 39:20.710
and I'm just feeling, like,
really strung out right now...

39:20.734 --> 39:22.277
Like, I've got
the fucking chills,

39:22.319 --> 39:24.237
and, like, then I'm just,
like, fucking sweating

39:24.279 --> 39:25.530
through my fucking shirt...

39:25.572 --> 39:27.157
I can't even sit fucking still.

39:27.199 --> 39:29.576
I'm feeling like a fucking
dope fiend, Courtney,

39:29.618 --> 39:31.328
and I don't fucking like it.

39:31.370 --> 39:32.871
So why don't you call me
the fuck back

39:32.913 --> 39:35.082
and tell me what
the fuck is going on?

39:35.123 --> 39:36.583
Okay, just, just,

39:36.625 --> 39:38.752
whatever you fucking gave me,
just let me know

39:38.794 --> 39:40.504
so I can kick it
with something else.

39:40.545 --> 39:41.588
Because I'm fucking, like,

39:41.630 --> 39:43.340
losing it right now,
Courtney, like...

39:43.423 --> 39:45.175
I am not well.

39:45.217 --> 39:47.094
Fuck you, bitch!

39:48.678 --> 39:50.639
Clive, hey baby, umm...

39:50.680 --> 39:51.932
I know that you're busy today,

39:51.973 --> 39:54.434
but if you could call me back,
I just, uhh...

39:54.476 --> 39:57.562
I really need to talk
to somebody.

39:57.604 --> 39:59.272
I really just want
to talk to you.

39:59.356 --> 40:01.566
Uhh... So... Call me back, okay?

40:01.608 --> 40:03.318
Bye.

40:44.651 --> 40:46.319
Courtney...

40:48.029 --> 40:50.282
I need to feel
what I felt last night...

40:51.950 --> 40:53.118
I need it.

40:53.869 --> 40:55.412
<i>I need it.</i>

40:55.871 --> 40:57.330
<i>I need it.</i>

40:57.831 --> 40:59.082
<i>I need it.</i>

40:59.124 --> 41:00.542
<i>I need it.</i>

41:01.793 --> 41:03.211
<i>I need it.</i>

41:03.753 --> 41:05.380
<i>I need it.</i>

41:06.756 --> 41:08.425
<i>I need it.</i>

41:08.758 --> 41:10.677
<i>I need it.</i>

41:56.181 --> 41:58.058
<i>Dez, wake up!</i>

41:58.099 --> 42:00.143
<i>Wake up, Dezzy, wake up.
Look at me!</i>

42:00.227 --> 42:01.853
<i>Hey! Hey, come on!</i>

42:06.942 --> 42:09.319
So you don't remember
doing any of this shit?

42:11.446 --> 42:13.031
Fuck.

42:13.073 --> 42:15.825
What about calling me?
Do you remember calling me?

42:15.867 --> 42:18.912
Okay, after that.
Anything after that?

42:20.580 --> 42:22.624
Are you serious?

42:22.707 --> 42:23.667
Jesus Christ, Dez,

42:23.668 --> 42:25.168
that was, like,
24 fucking hours.

42:25.210 --> 42:27.212
You don't remember anything?

42:27.254 --> 42:29.339
It's this fucking shit!

42:29.381 --> 42:30.840
This stuff.

42:30.882 --> 42:32.300
You gotta cut it out
with this shit,

42:32.342 --> 42:34.153
and whatever the fuck
else you're doing, I'm serious.

42:34.177 --> 42:36.596
Who the fuck are you?

42:37.597 --> 42:40.684
You don't fucking do anything.

42:40.725 --> 42:43.478
You sling drinks
behind a fucking bar,

42:43.520 --> 42:45.564
to fucking losers.

42:47.107 --> 42:49.442
You didn't even look at it.

42:49.484 --> 42:51.278
It's fucking great, Dez. Fine.

42:51.319 --> 42:53.238
- It's really fucking great...
- No! No!

42:53.280 --> 42:54.781
You don't even look at it.

42:54.823 --> 42:57.325
You see it,
but you don't fucking see!

42:57.367 --> 42:58.367
That's great!

42:58.368 --> 43:00.954
But it's not worth
fucking dying over.

43:01.871 --> 43:03.790
You will never know

43:03.832 --> 43:06.668
what it is like
to create something.

43:06.710 --> 43:09.379
And I'd rather
fucking die doing it

43:09.421 --> 43:11.047
than doing nothing,

43:11.089 --> 43:14.301
and drinking my life
away next to you.

43:17.554 --> 43:19.014
Wow.

43:19.055 --> 43:20.932
Yeah, I'm late, I gotta go.

43:20.974 --> 43:22.892
Paint your fucking masterpiece.

43:39.117 --> 43:39.867
<i>Who's this?</i>

43:39.868 --> 43:41.077
<i>Hey, it's Dezzy.</i>

43:41.119 --> 43:42.162
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

43:42.203 --> 43:43.121
<i>I didn't recognize the number.</i>

43:43.122 --> 43:44.664
<i>Yeah, I'm on a fucking payphone.</i>

43:44.706 --> 43:45.832
<i>You okay?</i>

43:45.874 --> 43:47.584
<i>I keep fucking blacking out.</i>

43:47.667 --> 43:49.502
<i>And I wake up.</i>

43:49.544 --> 43:50.962
<i>And there's all kind of painting</i>

43:51.004 --> 43:52.255
<i>that I don't remember.</i>

43:52.297 --> 43:54.382
<i>And now I'm seein' shit,</i>

43:54.424 --> 43:56.592
<i>- and I'm hearing shit.
- Jesus Christ, Dez, Okay.</i>

43:56.593 --> 43:58.553
<i>- Okay. Chill.
- And there's voices all around.</i>

43:58.595 --> 44:00.722
<i>- Hey!
- I can't get a hold of fuckin' anybody.</i>

44:00.764 --> 44:02.742
<i>- Everything's blending together.
- Dez, calm the fuck down.</i>

44:02.766 --> 44:04.434
<i>Just come over
to my place, okay?</i>

44:04.476 --> 44:05.976
<i>Come over right now.</i>

44:05.977 --> 44:07.395
<i>Have you seen Courtney?</i>

44:07.437 --> 44:09.105
<i>No, I haven't heard
from fucking Courtney.</i>

44:09.189 --> 44:10.398
<i>I haven't heard from anybody.</i>

44:10.440 --> 44:11.608
<i>She gave me something tonight</i>

44:11.650 --> 44:13.693
<i>and I need to fucking
talk to her.</i>

44:13.735 --> 44:14.736
<i>Look, chill the fuck out.</i>

44:14.778 --> 44:16.821
<i>Get over here, drive safe, okay?</i>

44:16.863 --> 44:18.990
<i>You need me to pick you up
or something?</i>

44:19.699 --> 44:20.950
Are you holding?

44:20.992 --> 44:22.619
<i>Am I holding? No, Jesus...</i>

44:22.661 --> 44:23.763
<i>Dez. You don't need that shit...</i>

44:23.787 --> 44:25.288
Be there in fifteen
fucking minutes.

44:25.330 --> 44:26.790
Courtney!

44:26.831 --> 44:29.501
Court, what the fuck
is your problem, dude?

44:29.542 --> 44:31.211
Girl, talk to me!

44:31.252 --> 44:33.505
Did you fucking attack
somebody last night?

44:33.546 --> 44:35.924
Who the fuck is Courtney?!
Jesus!

44:37.425 --> 44:39.344
Go fuck yourself!

44:48.186 --> 44:49.896
<i>Wait, wait wait. What?</i>

44:49.938 --> 44:51.356
Blood!

44:51.439 --> 44:54.359
I'm fucking craving it,
like I fucking need a fix.

44:54.401 --> 44:56.861
It's driving me
absolutely insane.

44:56.903 --> 44:58.405
What're you,
the fuckin' Lost Boys?

44:58.446 --> 44:59.882
I think you've been hitting
that powder a little too hard.

44:59.906 --> 45:02.158
Fuck you, I'm being serious!

45:02.200 --> 45:03.785
Well, how much
have you gone through?

45:03.827 --> 45:04.827
All of it.

45:04.828 --> 45:06.708
Holy hell, Dez,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

45:06.746 --> 45:08.164
It's not the fucking Bliss.

45:08.206 --> 45:09.517
The Bliss is actually
what's, like,

45:09.541 --> 45:11.042
helping me curb it,
and not, like,

45:11.084 --> 45:12.585
think about it for a second.

45:12.627 --> 45:14.254
It is the Bliss. Alright?

45:15.422 --> 45:17.590
Christ, maybe I can
ween you off of it

45:17.632 --> 45:18.776
with something a little lighter.

45:18.800 --> 45:21.261
I think Courtney fucking
killed somebody last night.

45:21.302 --> 45:22.470
This is ridiculous.

45:22.512 --> 45:24.639
I woke up with my face
covered in blood, Hadrian.

45:24.681 --> 45:26.349
How the fuck
do you explain that?

45:26.391 --> 45:27.851
How the fuck
do you explain that?!

45:27.892 --> 45:29.643
In all this painting
you've been doing,

45:29.644 --> 45:31.730
have you used
the fucking color red?

45:31.771 --> 45:32.771
While you've been
out of your mind on,

45:32.772 --> 45:34.208
like, four different
fucking things!?

45:34.232 --> 45:36.484
Christ, Dez. You sound insane!

45:36.526 --> 45:37.861
You want more of that shit?

45:37.902 --> 45:40.196
I'm almost finished, okay?

45:40.238 --> 45:42.031
So whatever I'm
doing is working.

45:42.073 --> 45:43.759
I'm not so sure that
I'd agree with that assessment.

45:43.783 --> 45:45.076
Just be my fucking friend

45:45.118 --> 45:46.619
and let me get
what I came here for!

45:46.661 --> 45:48.264
I am your friend,
and as your friend I shouldn't

45:48.288 --> 45:50.999
even fucking sell you
anything the way you are.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.600
I know you'd just get it
somewhere else,

45:52.625 --> 45:53.583
and it'd be garbage.
So let me...

45:53.585 --> 45:54.919
I just need to finish it.

45:54.961 --> 45:56.397
Let me get you
something a little lighter

45:56.421 --> 45:58.548
that's not gonna
wipe you out so much.

45:58.590 --> 46:00.258
Just hold on.

46:48.765 --> 46:50.766
Hey, look, if you've
gotta go to the hospital,

46:50.767 --> 46:51.767
I'll take you.

46:51.768 --> 46:53.561
But you didn't get shit
from me, alright?

46:53.603 --> 46:55.146
Fuck off!

46:58.107 --> 46:59.734
Oh, fuck...

46:59.776 --> 47:01.194
Can I get some privacy?

47:01.236 --> 47:02.654
Alright. Alright.

47:32.767 --> 47:33.517
You want to know how
I know you're not

47:33.518 --> 47:35.018
- gonna do anything about it?
- How's that, pal?

47:35.019 --> 47:36.205
Because you don't have
the fucking balls,

47:36.229 --> 47:37.414
and I'm giving you the chance.

47:37.438 --> 47:39.691
Oh, really?
Get that thing away from me.

47:39.732 --> 47:41.276
Come here.

47:41.317 --> 47:42.819
<i>You cheap piece of shit,</i>

47:42.861 --> 47:44.737
<i>that's the third hand in a
row, goddamn it...</i>

47:44.779 --> 47:47.282
Dez, whoa,
you don't look too good.

47:47.323 --> 47:48.908
You got that Diablo?

47:48.950 --> 47:50.052
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

47:50.076 --> 47:51.953
You need some water
or something.

47:51.995 --> 47:53.580
You want to go hop
in the shower?

47:53.621 --> 47:57.250
<i>We used our fists,
like real men!</i>

47:57.292 --> 47:59.586
Would you two shut the fuck up?!

47:59.627 --> 48:01.671
You're like a couple
of children over here.

48:01.713 --> 48:02.379
Fuck.

48:02.380 --> 48:04.090
<i>He pulled a fucking gun on me!</i>

48:04.132 --> 48:05.484
<i>He said he was gonna
blow my brains out,</i>

48:05.508 --> 48:06.509
<i>I gave him the chance.</i>

48:06.551 --> 48:07.385
<i>I'm gonna hold onto this</i>

48:07.386 --> 48:08.612
<i>until you two
calm the fuck down.</i>

48:08.636 --> 48:10.846
<i>Don't. Touch. My gun!</i>

48:10.847 --> 48:13.433
Oh, put that damn thing
away, would ya?

48:13.474 --> 48:14.767
Oh, what, you afraid, old man?

48:14.809 --> 48:16.477
Don't fucking point
that gun at...

48:16.519 --> 48:17.937
Fuck!

48:17.979 --> 48:19.564
- Oh, shit.
- Dude!

48:19.647 --> 48:20.958
Oh my God.

48:20.982 --> 48:22.650
You fucking piece of shit!

48:22.692 --> 48:23.568
Oh my God, dude,

48:23.569 --> 48:25.629
- I was just fucking around!
- You fucking broke my nose!

48:25.653 --> 48:28.239
Don't fucking touch it!
Go outside!

48:28.656 --> 48:30.867
<i>Go outside, cool the fuck off.</i>

48:30.909 --> 48:32.410
<i>Fucking prick.</i>

48:32.452 --> 48:33.786
<i>Keep walking, bitch!</i>

48:33.828 --> 48:35.663
<i>Can you believe this shit?</i>

48:35.705 --> 48:37.206
Fuck.

48:37.248 --> 48:40.209
Goddamn it,
he broke my fucking nose.

48:40.251 --> 48:42.503
<i>What the hell is the
son-of-a-bitch doing</i>

48:42.545 --> 48:44.213
bringing a gun in my
house anyway?

48:45.298 --> 48:46.716
Dez?

48:46.758 --> 48:48.051
<i>Fuck, are you okay?</i>

49:05.526 --> 49:06.861
Jesus!

49:13.451 --> 49:15.536
<i>What the fuck?!</i>

49:17.872 --> 49:19.165
Fuck! Fuck!

49:22.835 --> 49:24.295
Fuck!

49:25.421 --> 49:26.714
Oh, shit!

50:34.282 --> 50:36.492
What in the fuck?!

52:51.878 --> 52:53.129
<i>♪ C'mon you fuckers</i>

52:53.212 --> 52:55.381
<i>♪ You want to live forever</i>

53:04.557 --> 53:06.475
<i>Goddamn it, Dezzy!</i>

53:06.517 --> 53:08.978
<i>Turn that fucking music down!</i>

53:59.654 --> 54:01.322
Hello?

54:24.095 --> 54:25.846
Hello?

54:26.013 --> 54:27.139
Hello! Oh!

54:27.181 --> 54:29.350
Sorry, hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

54:29.392 --> 54:30.953
Nikki told me this was ready
for exhibition.

54:30.977 --> 54:31.517
I just had to see it...

54:31.519 --> 54:33.521
How the hell did you
get in my apartment?!

54:33.562 --> 54:34.814
Relax, the door was open,

54:34.897 --> 54:35.999
you weren't answering
your phone.

54:36.023 --> 54:36.939
The way Nikki described you,

54:36.941 --> 54:38.001
I thought something
might've happened.

54:38.025 --> 54:39.151
I was worried.

54:39.193 --> 54:41.070
I'm fine. Goodbye.

54:41.112 --> 54:42.863
Okay, look.

54:42.905 --> 54:45.283
Maybe I was a little
rash the other day,

54:45.324 --> 54:47.368
but, y'know, I just wanted
to light a fire

54:47.410 --> 54:49.078
under your ass, and hello!

54:49.120 --> 54:51.330
Looks like it worked.

54:51.372 --> 54:53.582
David, go fuck yourself.

54:53.624 --> 54:55.584
Really, that's the thanks I get?

54:55.626 --> 54:58.004
Yeah, thanks for fuckin'
dropping me a week ago,

54:58.045 --> 55:00.339
you sycophantic piece of shit.

55:00.381 --> 55:01.674
Now that it's almost finished,

55:01.716 --> 55:03.676
now you want to
fucking leech off a piece?

55:03.718 --> 55:05.177
Fuck you, David.

55:05.219 --> 55:06.512
I get it, you're mad.

55:06.554 --> 55:07.930
But you know what I can do?

55:07.972 --> 55:09.932
I can convince Nikki
to keep the exhibition on.

55:09.974 --> 55:11.475
She's already convinced.

55:12.685 --> 55:14.562
Okay, fine!

55:14.603 --> 55:16.105
I will cut my commission down.

55:16.188 --> 55:18.482
From what? Zero?

55:21.235 --> 55:22.820
I need to get back to work. Yes.

55:22.862 --> 55:24.447
I need to shower, I need to eat.

55:24.488 --> 55:25.823
You're wasting my fucking time.

55:25.865 --> 55:28.242
Good. You're so angsty,
I love this.

55:28.284 --> 55:29.952
I'll see you
at the exhibition and,

55:29.994 --> 55:31.412
uhh, we'll talk then!

55:31.454 --> 55:32.663
Alright!

56:03.611 --> 56:05.321
Hey, Lance?

56:06.739 --> 56:08.783
Hey, Lance, you in there?

56:13.788 --> 56:16.415
Hey, Hadrian, open up, it's Dez!

56:18.459 --> 56:20.211
Hey!

56:29.428 --> 56:30.679
<i>Hey, What's up?</i>

56:30.721 --> 56:31.889
<i>Fooled ya!</i>

56:31.931 --> 56:33.849
<i>It's Hadrian, leave a message.</i>

56:34.100 --> 56:35.935
Hadrian, it's Dez.

56:35.976 --> 56:37.728
I don't know what
happened last night.

56:37.770 --> 56:39.021
I can't remember.

56:39.063 --> 56:42.650
I tried coming by and I
got no answer, and...

56:42.733 --> 56:44.860
Yeah, I'm scared.

56:45.986 --> 56:48.030
Hey, Court. Court!

56:48.072 --> 56:49.323
Hey!

56:49.365 --> 56:52.368
Hey, it's Dez, I've been trying
to get a hold of you.

56:56.080 --> 56:57.498
Where are you?

57:17.101 --> 57:18.352
Hey!

57:18.394 --> 57:20.622
Is there a fucking reason you
haven't called me back yet?

57:20.646 --> 57:22.940
I haven't gotten around to it.

57:27.695 --> 57:28.653
Don't do that.

57:28.654 --> 57:30.216
Don't give me that
fucking cute little bitch

57:30.239 --> 57:31.949
routine right now.

57:31.991 --> 57:34.201
What the fuck did you do to me?!

57:36.495 --> 57:37.997
Ever since
that fucking bathroom,

57:38.038 --> 57:40.291
half of my existence
is a fucking blackout,

57:40.332 --> 57:42.668
and the rest is just withdrawal
like a motherfucker.

57:42.710 --> 57:45.420
So tell me what the fuck
is going on!

57:45.421 --> 57:47.506
You know what's wrong.

57:48.966 --> 57:51.510
And it looks like you've
already fixed the problem.

57:52.887 --> 57:54.030
Now, if you'll excuse me, doll,

57:54.054 --> 57:55.556
I'm gonna go get myself
another drink.

57:56.849 --> 57:59.309
Tell me how to make it stop!

57:59.310 --> 58:01.562
You just have to
embrace it, hon.

58:01.604 --> 58:03.189
You'll come around.

58:06.650 --> 58:08.527
I refuse.

58:08.569 --> 58:10.237
This isn't dope.

58:10.279 --> 58:12.072
This isn't booze.

58:12.114 --> 58:13.908
This isn't Bliss.

58:15.784 --> 58:18.037
You don't give it up.

58:18.287 --> 58:19.497
You can't.

58:23.918 --> 58:25.753
Forever.

58:26.962 --> 58:28.130
Fuck you.

58:28.172 --> 58:30.424
Fuck you. Fuck you!

58:33.552 --> 58:34.970
Fuck you!

59:13.676 --> 59:15.511
<i>Forever...</i>

59:27.147 --> 59:28.482
<i>Dez!</i>

59:30.985 --> 59:32.319
What the fuck?

59:32.361 --> 59:34.196
Hey! I called you like,
a hundred times...

59:34.238 --> 59:35.781
- You can't be here.
- Can't be here?

59:35.823 --> 59:36.699
Look, I'm not going anywhere.

59:36.700 --> 59:37.700
Hey! Will you look at me?

59:37.741 --> 59:40.119
Get the fuck
out of my face, Clive!

59:40.160 --> 59:42.580
I don't want you here!

59:42.621 --> 59:45.124
You look like shit
in a box, Dez.

59:45.165 --> 59:46.709
Okay? I knew something was up.

59:46.750 --> 59:48.460
Courtney said
this was fucking bad,

59:48.502 --> 59:49.420
but I didn't know how bad.

59:49.421 --> 59:51.255
I mean, what the fuck
is going on?

59:51.297 --> 59:53.507
What the fuck
did she say about me?

59:53.549 --> 59:54.717
She's just worried, is all...

59:54.758 --> 59:56.260
You tell that
absent-minded bitch

59:56.302 --> 59:57.737
that the next time
she wants to flutter

59:57.761 --> 59:59.930
my fucking name through
her gap-toothed grin

59:59.972 --> 01:00:02.725
that she can say it
to my fucking face.

01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:07.021
Jesus Christ.

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:08.772
Dez?

01:00:08.814 --> 01:00:11.251
- Clive, you need to leave.
- I'm not going anywhere.

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:14.403
Please leave.
Leave. Leave.

01:00:14.445 --> 01:00:16.572
What'd you do? What'd you do?

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:18.574
You're fucking burning up!

01:00:18.616 --> 01:00:19.825
You're on fuckin' fire,

01:00:19.867 --> 01:00:21.243
you're going to fuckin' die.

01:00:22.411 --> 01:00:23.537
Just stay there!

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:26.498
Hey! Hey, hey.

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.541
Hey.

01:00:29.043 --> 01:00:30.669
Dezzy, Jesus Christ.

01:00:30.711 --> 01:00:33.297
- You can't be here!
- I'm not going anywhere!

01:00:33.339 --> 01:00:35.257
Let me take care of you. Please.

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:37.259
What was it, what'd you do?!

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:39.094
It's that fucking
Bliss shit, isn't it?

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:41.972
Hey, hey, hey. Leave, leave.

01:00:42.014 --> 01:00:44.767
Leave!

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.527
Fine, I'm gonna call
a fuckin' ambulance.

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:56.588
<i>Because I'm not
going to sit here</i>

01:00:56.612 --> 01:00:58.113
<i>and watch you fuckin' die.</i>

01:00:58.155 --> 01:00:59.507
<i>You better hope
there's not a bunch</i>

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:00.967
<i>of fucking drugs
in this apartment, either.</i>

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:02.826
<i>You're gonna be in
a world of shit.</i>

01:01:02.868 --> 01:01:04.036
<i>They'll take all that shit,</i>

01:01:04.078 --> 01:01:05.704
<i>and all your
fucking paintings...</i>

01:01:22.346 --> 01:01:24.639
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:27.184
Oh my God, Dezzy!

01:01:27.226 --> 01:01:28.560
Dezzy, no, wait, wait, wait!

01:01:28.644 --> 01:01:30.312
What the fuck?!

01:03:37.189 --> 01:03:38.649
Come here, you fucking bitch!

01:03:55.916 --> 01:03:59.127
<i>You fucking bitch,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.</i>

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:00.795
<i>You open this fucking door.</i>

01:04:00.796 --> 01:04:03.549
<i>Open this fucking door, Dezzy!</i>

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:05.300
<i>Open the door, Dezzy.</i>

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:07.135
<i>Open the fucking door.</i>

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:08.387
<i>I'm gonna get in there</i>

01:04:08.428 --> 01:04:12.182
<i>and I'm gonna fucking kill you,
you stupid fucking bitch!</i>

01:04:12.224 --> 01:04:16.812
<i>Look what you did to me!
Look what you did to me!</i>

01:04:16.854 --> 01:04:18.188
<i>Do it.</i>

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:21.316
<i>Do it, you fucking pussy!</i>

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:24.152
<i>You fucking pussy, you bitch.</i>

01:04:24.486 --> 01:04:25.779
<i>You murderer.</i>

01:04:25.821 --> 01:04:28.115
You murderer!

01:04:28.156 --> 01:04:30.576
<i>You murderer!</i>

01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:33.912
<i>Oh, I'm going
to fucking kill you.</i>

01:06:13.345 --> 01:06:14.930
It's almost finished.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.892
It's impressive.

01:06:19.351 --> 01:06:22.980
Tell me, Dez.
Do you think it was the Bliss?

01:06:23.021 --> 01:06:24.940
Or the blood?

01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:29.653
My money's on the blood.

01:06:29.695 --> 01:06:31.321
It's me.

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.659
You remember earlier?

01:06:35.701 --> 01:06:37.869
When you were
fucking killing me?!

01:06:39.955 --> 01:06:42.290
At first I was so scared.

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:46.169
Then I was really fucking
pissed off at you.

01:06:47.546 --> 01:06:49.339
But now I get it.

01:06:49.381 --> 01:06:51.466
You wanted a partner.

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:53.135
You chose me.

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:54.386
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:06:54.428 --> 01:06:56.138
Get the fuck out of here!

01:06:57.597 --> 01:07:02.477
Now we can create together.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:12.404
Unless you ruin the heart.

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:31.173
Have you been snorting
this shit all night?

01:07:35.343 --> 01:07:38.180
With all those bodies
you drained?

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:40.932
Look at this shit.

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:44.561
You dumb, untalented,
shit-stain on society.

01:07:44.603 --> 01:07:47.522
You think this fucking
town is a buffet?

01:07:47.606 --> 01:07:48.606
It's not.

01:07:48.607 --> 01:07:50.567
There's fucking rules!

01:07:50.609 --> 01:07:53.695
But you, with your
supercharged blood
