(SINGING) It seems today that all you see
is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.217 --> 00:11.678
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.762 --> 00:14.848

00:14.932 --> 00:18.310
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.393 --> 00:21.438
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.563 --> 00:23.148
All the things that make us

00:23.232 --> 00:24.942
Laugh and cry!

00:25.025 --> 00:29.821
ALL: He's a family guy!

00:35.285 --> 00:36.745
Oh, Joe, thank you so much

00:36.828 --> 00:38.038
for inviting us
to your barbecue.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.414
Well, it's my pleasure, Lois.

00:39.498 --> 00:42.167
Hey, can one
of you other men come over here

00:42.251 --> 00:44.336
and comment on the meat
while I'm cooking it?

00:44.419 --> 00:46.129
Yeah, I got it.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.632
Oh, yeah, oh,
those are looking good.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.342
Yeah, that's
what I'm talking about.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.135
Yeah, don't flip 'em
too often, now.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.179
You don't want
to lose the juices.

00:54.263 --> 00:56.431
Yeah, yeah,
coming along nicely.

00:56.515 --> 00:57.975
Oh, those are cooking just fine.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.434

00:59.518 --> 01:01.770

in the exact same spot.

Oh, thanks, Lois.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.539
Hey, do you mind rubbing some
of that sunblock on my back?

01:20.622 --> 01:22.332
Of course, Bonnie.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.459
Ooh, but I don't want
to get any on my shirt.

to your son, Kevin?

without that dress.

Oh, I don't know.
Will I ever wear it?

01:53.280 --> 01:54.406
Yes, you will.
You've got that thing

01:54.489 --> 01:55.824
for the opening
of the library next week.

01:55.908 --> 01:57.367
It's perfect for that.

by a baby girl.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.572
Aw, man, this is more painful
to watch

02:35.656 --> 02:37.658

a Tina Yothers episode.

this isn't gonna hurt at all.

Lois, you should just let
those wounds get infected.

It'll teach him a lesson
about being tough.

by a girl.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.241
What was weird was
that she was crying,

03:19.324 --> 03:21.869
but the way she was standing
over me made it look

03:21.952 --> 03:24.746
like I was crying,
which was weird.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.206
Peter, what exactly
are you worried

03:26.290 --> 03:27.624
is gonna happen
because of this?

World War V.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.127
Peter, we've been over this.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.880
There has to be a World War III
and IV first.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.757
Oh, no. Oh, no. That's the beauty
of World War V, Lois.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.634
It's so intense,
it skips over the other two.

in the hall the other day

03:52.482 --> 03:54.401
about how much you liked
High School Musical 2,

03:54.484 --> 03:56.528
so I burned you the soundtrack.

03:56.612 --> 03:58.864

for itemized insults.

to me talk.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.367
You don't deserve my words.

04:02.451 --> 04:05.579
B. When I said I enjoyed it,
I was speaking ironically.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.540

High School Musical?

04:08.624 --> 04:10.375
What are you, eight?

04:10.459 --> 04:12.419

bear with me on this.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.409
What if I date a loser

04:44.493 --> 04:46.328
and make him over
into a popular guy?

glad I hung in there.

to smell it.

you would have been some

09:06.380 --> 09:07.756
(GRUNTS)

09:07.840 --> 09:10.300
I am hotter than phone sex
with a blind girl.

09:10.592 --> 09:11.760
You sound hot.

09:11.844 --> 09:12.928
What are you wearing?

09:13.011 --> 09:14.012
I don't know.

09:23.397 --> 09:26.859
ANNOUNCER: (ON RADIO)
Classic rock 103.7 WHTT.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.485
I hate this station.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.863
They always make promises
they can't deliver.

09:30.946 --> 09:34.491
Playing the greatest rock
and roll hits of all time.

09:34.575 --> 09:35.909
(MUSIC PLAYS)

09:35.993 --> 09:37.995
-See?
-Chris, turn that off.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.581
We have a lot of work to do
before we go inside.

09:40.664 --> 09:42.499
All right, if I'm going
to be seen with you,

09:42.583 --> 09:44.126
we have to do something
about that look.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.794
Now, take that hat off.

09:45.878 --> 09:47.546
(BAT SQUEAKING)

09:47.629 --> 09:49.590
Oh, God, your hair's all combed.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.884
Here, let me fix that.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.385
All right, good.

09:53.468 --> 09:56.763
Now, let's give you
a pencil-thin douche bag beard.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.765
Oh, heavens,
I look like a rake.

09:58.891 --> 10:01.310
No, you look like you don't care,
and that's good.

10:01.393 --> 10:02.728
Oh, okay.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.813
Um, if we're dating,
does that mean when

10:04.897 --> 10:07.566
-we go in there, I can hold your hand?
-Good idea.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.401
Then everyone will
think you're popular.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.111
Well, I don't really
care about that.

10:11.195 --> 10:13.989
I want to hold your hand
'cause I like you.

10:14.072 --> 10:15.449
I don't understand.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.034
Well, I think you're nice,

10:17.117 --> 10:18.577
and I like spending time
with you.

10:18.660 --> 10:19.912
You're really pretty,

10:19.995 --> 10:22.456
and I hope I get to be
with you for a long time.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.875
Wow, um...

10:24.958 --> 10:27.586
no guy's ever said anything
that nice to me before.

10:27.669 --> 10:30.047
Well, maybe you've been
hanging around with jerks.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.133
Yeah, maybe I have.

10:33.217 --> 10:34.801
Hey, forget the pep rally.

10:34.885 --> 10:36.094
You want to go see a movie?

10:36.178 --> 10:38.222
Cool! Maybe we can go see that

10:38.305 --> 10:41.850
Chazz Palminteri/Paul Sorvino

10:41.934 --> 10:43.185
-(TRUMPET PLAYING LOUDLY)
-I want to thank you all

10:43.268 --> 10:44.436
for coming out here today.

10:44.520 --> 10:47.147
We got a serious situation
down in the Bronx.

10:47.231 --> 10:48.774
-(TRUMPET PLAYING LOUDER)
-Our friend needs to get

10:48.857 --> 10:50.943
a message to the short man
in the hat.

10:51.026 --> 10:53.153
He needs
to deliver this message

10:53.237 --> 10:56.657
before the construction site contracts
are handed down!

10:56.740 --> 11:01.370
It's of vital importance that
these matters be attended to!

11:01.453 --> 11:04.998
So we may have to bring in
our friend from Yonkers!

11:05.082 --> 11:06.291
-(SHOUTING) What?
-I say,

11:06.375 --> 11:10.170
we may have to bring in
our friend from Yonkers!

11:14.508 --> 11:16.009
Hey, what the hell?

11:16.093 --> 11:18.011
Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Is there a problem? Huh?

11:18.095 --> 11:19.429
You want to go?
You want to go?

11:19.513 --> 11:20.848
"Go?" What are you talking about?

11:20.931 --> 11:22.057
I'm talking about "go."

11:22.140 --> 11:23.350
That's what
I'm talking about.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.185
-First one's on the house.
-I got things to do.

11:25.269 --> 11:27.396
-Uh, where do you think you're going?
-I'm going downstairs.

11:27.479 --> 11:28.856
Oh, there's a toll in the hall now.

11:28.939 --> 11:31.316
-Ten bucks. Uhp.
-Look, can I... I just...

11:31.400 --> 11:32.568
Uhp.

11:32.651 --> 11:33.944
-Stewie...
-Uhp.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.571
-Look...
-Uhp.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.072
-Come on...
-Uhp.

11:37.155 --> 11:39.491
-I... Just...
-Uhp. Uhp.

11:39.575 --> 11:40.742
-You...
-Uhp.

11:40.826 --> 11:42.494
-This is...
-Uhp.

11:42.578 --> 11:43.912
-Can I...
-Uhp.

11:43.996 --> 11:45.747
Ah, I'm just messing
with you, man!

11:45.831 --> 11:46.832
You can do
whatever you want!

11:46.915 --> 11:48.250
I was just kidding you!

11:48.333 --> 11:49.751
Why you so serious?

11:53.463 --> 11:56.258
All right, Chrissy,
here we go.

11:56.341 --> 11:57.759
(GASPING) Look!

11:57.843 --> 11:59.344
Oh, my God!

11:59.428 --> 12:01.054
Is that Chris Griffin
with Connie D'Amico?

12:01.138 --> 12:03.557
-I think it is!
-Wow, that makes him popular.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.933
Hey, Griffin.

12:05.017 --> 12:07.519
-Griff-a!
-Griff-a-Mano!

12:07.603 --> 12:10.731
(UNINTELLIGIBLE)

12:10.814 --> 12:13.442
Wow, the jocks have never
said hello to me before.

12:13.525 --> 12:14.651
Hi, you guys!

12:14.735 --> 12:16.278
Wow, you did it, Connie.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.155
Chris Griffin is popular.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.364
So, you going
to dump him now?

12:19.448 --> 12:20.908
No, Gina, I'm not.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.451
-You're not?
-No.

12:22.534 --> 12:23.702
There's something about him.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.120
He's not like the other guys.

12:25.204 --> 12:27.789
-I actually really like him.
-You do?

12:27.873 --> 12:29.708
Yeah, in fact,
I'm going to his house

12:29.791 --> 12:32.419
for dinner tonight,
so I can meet his parents.

12:35.130 --> 12:38.842
Wow, Connie D'Amico is coming
to my house for dinner!

12:38.926 --> 12:40.969
I just hope Dad
doesn't embarrass us,

12:41.053 --> 12:43.388
like he did when that
one-legged guy came over.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.807
All right, well,
if you like movie trivia,

12:45.891 --> 12:48.310
I got one that'll
stump you-- Uh...

12:48.393 --> 12:51.104
Of course, you're probably not
really into tibia-- Trivia.

12:51.188 --> 12:54.316
Uh... boy that
global warming, huh?

12:54.399 --> 12:58.195
They say we lost a foot of snow
last winter-- Uh...

12:58.278 --> 12:59.613
Hey, how about another beer,
huh?

12:59.696 --> 13:01.114
I bet you like
the taste of hops...

13:01.240 --> 13:02.407
Uh...

13:02.699 --> 13:04.743
You only have one leg, sir.

13:08.956 --> 13:11.458
Oh, Connie,
it's so nice to meet you.

13:11.542 --> 13:13.502
We're so excited
that Chris is finally

13:13.585 --> 13:15.128
bringing a girl
home for dinner.

13:15.212 --> 13:17.297
It's really nice to meet you,
too, Mrs. Griffin.

13:17.381 --> 13:19.967
Um, do you mind if I ask
what's up with your baby?

13:20.050 --> 13:21.468
I'm going to go work out.

13:21.552 --> 13:23.637
Again? That's like
the eighth time today.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.597
I'm not satisfied
until every vein

13:25.681 --> 13:27.182
is forced up against my skin.

13:27.266 --> 13:29.101
Look how vascular I am, Brian.

13:29.184 --> 13:32.437
If there's one thing women love,
it's a vascular man.

13:32.521 --> 13:36.733
I've got veins

13:36.817 --> 13:40.195
They carry blood
all over my "bahdy."

13:40.279 --> 13:41.697
That's how John Mayer
would say it.

13:41.780 --> 13:42.906
"Bahdy."

13:42.990 --> 13:44.032
I'm really into him now.

13:44.116 --> 13:45.534
You better be okay with it!

13:45.617 --> 13:47.619
Well, to answer
your question, Connie,

13:47.703 --> 13:49.997
apparently I'm married
to a man who thinks

13:50.080 --> 13:52.541
it's okay to inject
an infant with steroids.

13:52.624 --> 13:53.750
Wait, Lois,
knock it off for a sec.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.878
Connie, you are really pretty.

13:55.961 --> 13:58.338
I mean, you have filled out
something wacky.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.632
Oh. Thanks, Mr. Griffin.

14:00.716 --> 14:03.218
-I like what you're doing with your boobs.
-Dad!

14:03.302 --> 14:05.304
So, Connie, now that
you're dating my brother,

14:05.387 --> 14:07.097
maybe we can hang out,
you know?

14:07.181 --> 14:09.266
Hey, after dinner,
you want to come up to my room

14:09.349 --> 14:10.851
and give each other makeovers?

14:10.934 --> 14:12.686
I don't use makeup, Meg.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.771
Of course you don't,
you're all natural.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.732
Man, your dad must be proud.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.443
Actually, my dad passed away
four years ago.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.236
Yeah, yeah, he did.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.113
He sure did.

14:23.197 --> 14:24.823
You going to shower
before dessert?

14:27.326 --> 14:29.494
Greggy! Fitzy!

14:29.578 --> 14:31.830
T-bone! Gabagoo!

14:31.914 --> 14:33.207
Nazi guy!

14:33.290 --> 14:34.750
Griffa!

14:34.833 --> 14:36.126
Hey, we're totally stoked

14:36.210 --> 14:37.836
for your party this weekend!

14:37.920 --> 14:39.588
(LAUGHS) You know it, brother.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.381
It's going to be awesome.

14:41.465 --> 14:44.343
But keep it on the down-low
so the spazoids don't catch wind.

14:44.426 --> 14:45.552
(LAUGHS)

14:45.636 --> 14:47.763
(GROANS) Speaking of spazoids.

14:47.846 --> 14:50.307
Wow, can you believe it, Connie?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.643
You and I are going
to be at the same party this weekend!

14:52.726 --> 14:54.603
Oh, this is so cool!

14:54.686 --> 14:55.896
Hey, what are you wearing

14:55.979 --> 14:57.439
so I make sure I don't
wear the same thing?

14:57.523 --> 15:00.567
-Um, you're not invited, Meg.
-What?

15:00.651 --> 15:02.945
But... it's at my house.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.154
Uh, Connie, let me handle this.

15:04.238 --> 15:06.240
I'm sorry, Meg,
you can't come.

15:06.323 --> 15:10.202
There's an ass-to-boob ratio
that you're way off of.

15:10.285 --> 15:12.663
Hey, Chris, come on,
let's corner the nerds

15:12.746 --> 15:14.998
and call them gay and make them
show us their penises.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.875
Won't that be gay of them?

15:16.959 --> 15:19.086
(LAUGHTER)
Yeah, that is bro-tacular.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.421
-Way to go, man.
-Awesome, bro.

15:26.218 --> 15:28.554
(MUSIC PLAYING)

15:32.432 --> 15:35.561
Man, our boy, Chris,
partying with the cool kids.

15:35.644 --> 15:37.688
I am a very proud
dad right now.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.189
And look at that Connie,

15:39.273 --> 15:41.483
so young and lithe.

15:41.567 --> 15:44.027
Look at the shape
of that body.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.779
Look at the shape of
that body!

15:46.989 --> 15:48.407
That's it, Brian!

15:48.490 --> 15:50.617
That's where One-Eyed Willie
buried his gold!

15:50.909 --> 15:52.786
(CRYING)

15:55.330 --> 15:57.457
Oh, Meg, sweetheart,
why don't you just

15:57.541 --> 15:59.251
go downstairs and
join the party?

15:59.334 --> 16:00.878
I wasn't invited!

16:00.961 --> 16:02.546
I hate Chris!

16:02.629 --> 16:04.131
He's such a jerk!

16:04.214 --> 16:06.008
Oh, look, honey,
he's just a little confused

16:06.091 --> 16:07.593
about who he is right now.

16:07.676 --> 16:10.721
I'm sure deep down,
he still loves his big sister.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.347
I hate my school!

16:12.431 --> 16:13.599
I hate everyone!

16:13.682 --> 16:15.601
I hate my life!

16:15.684 --> 16:18.145
(SIGHS) Okay, look, Meg,
I've been at this for 45 minutes.

16:18.228 --> 16:19.980
I don't know what
else I can say.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.107
Here's a Sylvia Plath book
and a bottle of Ambien.

16:22.191 --> 16:23.483
I'm going to look
the other way,

16:23.567 --> 16:25.027
and whatever happens, happens.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.820
(PARTY MUSIC PLAYING)

16:32.743 --> 16:34.411
Gina, have you seen Chris?

16:34.494 --> 16:35.954
Yeah, he's over there.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.667
Chris, what are you doing?

16:40.751 --> 16:42.753
Getting scraped to death
by my zipper.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.254
You bastard!

16:44.338 --> 16:46.089
How the hell can you be
cheating on me?

16:46.173 --> 16:48.133
I'm the one
who made you popular!

16:48.217 --> 16:51.762
No, Connie, beating up
that Jewish kid made me popular.

16:51.845 --> 16:54.389
Come on, girls,
let's go upstairs and make out.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.685
Oh, no, Connie's been hurt!

16:58.769 --> 17:01.063
I guess I should lie
on top of her to keep her warm.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.150
What are you looking at?
It's a cartoon!

17:09.446 --> 17:12.074
Chris, I can't believe
you dissed Connie at your party.

17:12.157 --> 17:13.867
-That was awesome!
-Yeah, I heard about it

17:13.951 --> 17:15.911
when I was making that
gay nerd spoon with me.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.871
Hey, guys.
Room for one more?

17:17.955 --> 17:19.039
I don't think so.

17:19.122 --> 17:20.791
-(COUGHS) Loser.
-(COUGHS) Reject.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.209
(COUGHS) Everyone's gay but me.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.007
My God, he's practically ruined me.

17:29.091 --> 17:30.717
I've created a monster.

17:30.801 --> 17:32.302
Meg, we've got to do something.

17:32.386 --> 17:34.388
"We"? Are you kidding?

17:34.471 --> 17:36.265
Do you really think
I would help you out

17:36.348 --> 17:38.600
in any way after everything
you've done to me?

17:38.684 --> 17:39.685
What are you talking about?

17:39.768 --> 17:41.019
You see this, Connie?

17:41.103 --> 17:44.398
This is from when you called me
"sticky ass-cow" in sixth grade.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.650
This one is from when
you made a plaster cast

17:46.733 --> 17:48.443
of my vagina freshmen year.

17:48.527 --> 17:49.736
You want my help?

17:49.820 --> 17:51.363
You can go (BLEEP) yourself!

17:51.446 --> 17:53.198
CHRIS: Hey, Meg, think fast!

17:53.282 --> 17:55.075
Ha-ha! Loser!

17:55.158 --> 17:56.702
All right, let's do it.

17:56.785 --> 17:59.162
When we're done with him,
he'll be more of an outcast

17:59.246 --> 18:00.914
than a seagull
at an Adam Sandler movie.

18:04.418 --> 18:08.297
This is my old bicycle
that I had from when I was ten.

18:08.380 --> 18:10.174
(SCREECHING LAUGH)

18:10.257 --> 18:14.052
Sometimes the banana seat
hurts my heinie.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.597
-(SCREECHING LAUGH)
-Will you shut up?

18:16.680 --> 18:18.348
You shut up, man,
it's a comedy!

18:18.432 --> 18:20.684
When I ring the bell,
it makes my pants feel funny.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.978
Ring, ring, ring!

18:23.061 --> 18:24.813
(SCREECHING LAUGH)

18:28.901 --> 18:32.779
Ah, another day of being huge.

18:32.863 --> 18:35.157
Good morning, guns of Navaro--
(GASPS)

18:35.240 --> 18:36.283
Oh, no!

18:37.659 --> 18:39.328
What's happening?

18:39.411 --> 18:40.621
I'll tell you
what's happening.

18:40.704 --> 18:42.247
Your steroids have worn off.

18:42.331 --> 18:43.540
You're weak like everyone else.

18:43.624 --> 18:44.875
And guess what?

18:44.958 --> 18:46.627
There's a toll in the hall now.

18:46.710 --> 18:47.711
Stay away from me!

18:47.794 --> 18:49.087
-Stay away from me!
-Stewie, no!

18:56.512 --> 18:59.681
And now, here's something
we hope you'll really like.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.395
Settle down, everyone.

19:05.479 --> 19:07.606
Okay, let's get
this assembly started.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.274
Is everything set, Meg?

19:09.358 --> 19:11.818
Once Chris gets up there,
my friend in the AV department

19:11.902 --> 19:13.111
will take care of everything.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.738
Okay, Meg,
remember our deal.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.449
I do this for you,
and I have your permission

19:17.533 --> 19:19.868
to think about you later tonight
when I'm in the tub.

19:19.952 --> 19:21.036
Fine, Neil.

19:21.119 --> 19:24.289
Awesome! I might even
go lefty tonight.

19:24.373 --> 19:26.333
Stranger in the tub.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.043
Before we begin,
Chris Griffin

19:28.126 --> 19:29.920
has an announcement
for the cool kids.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.422
Yeah, hey, guys.

19:32.506 --> 19:35.300
The meeting of the cool kids
club will be at 3:15,

19:35.384 --> 19:37.511
leaning up against
Tim Breckner's SUV

19:37.594 --> 19:38.595
in the parking lot.

19:40.514 --> 19:42.349
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

19:48.939 --> 19:52.067
Would you do me?

19:52.150 --> 19:54.862
I'd do me.

19:54.945 --> 19:56.572
I'd do me so hard.

19:56.780 --> 19:58.866
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

20:10.169 --> 20:11.336
Hey, Chris. What's that?

20:11.420 --> 20:12.588
Did you sit on something?

20:12.671 --> 20:14.506
(GASPING, GRUNTING)

20:16.466 --> 20:18.051
(LAUGHTER)

20:18.135 --> 20:19.678
Chris Griffin's a freak!

20:19.761 --> 20:21.930
-What a loser!
-I'm gay, all right!

20:22.014 --> 20:25.184
Ah, come on, it's me.
Griffa!

20:25.267 --> 20:27.227
You don't get to talk
like that anymore!

20:27.311 --> 20:29.188
Connie, the person
who humiliated you

20:29.271 --> 20:31.023
has himself
been humiliated.

20:31.106 --> 20:32.232
By the rules
of high school,

20:32.316 --> 20:34.401
you are now popular again.

20:34.484 --> 20:35.861
Well, we did it, Connie.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.779
Thanks for your help, Meg.

20:37.863 --> 20:40.157
There's no chance we're
going to be friends now, is there?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.533
Absolutely not.

20:41.617 --> 20:43.869
Can I at least think
about you in the tub later?

20:43.952 --> 20:45.704
No.

20:45.787 --> 20:46.914
I'm still gonna.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.628
Well, Chris, you must feel ridiculous.

20:52.711 --> 20:53.921
I do, Dad.

20:54.046 --> 20:56.590
And, Meg, I'm really sorry
I was such a douche.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.592
Well, there is a way
you can make it up to me.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.886
-How?
-Tell me what it was like,

21:00.969 --> 21:02.179
being one of them.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.848
It was like basking
in the warm glow

21:04.932 --> 21:07.434
of a higher intelligence
as it envelops you

21:07.518 --> 21:11.230
and allows you to become part
of its everlasting glory.

21:13.106 --> 21:14.107
I flew today.

21:15.901 --> 21:17.903
