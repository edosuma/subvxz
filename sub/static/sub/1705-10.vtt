<i>Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

00:09.138 --> 00:12.139
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

00:12.141 --> 00:14.341
<i>Pan Am flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

00:14.343 --> 00:15.643
<i>He has sanctioned
acts of terror</i>

00:15.645 --> 00:18.145
<i>in Africa, Europe</i>
<i>and the Middle East.</i>

00:18.147 --> 00:20.748
<i>This will not stand, this
aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

00:20.750 --> 00:22.650
<i>This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

00:22.652 --> 00:24.485
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

00:24.487 --> 00:26.320
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:26.322 --> 00:27.188
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

00:27.190 --> 00:29.156
This was an act of terrorism.

00:29.158 --> 00:31.525
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:31.527 --> 00:34.095
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

00:34.097 --> 00:35.229
is one of the good old
favorites.

00:35.231 --> 00:37.665
...until something stops him.

00:37.667 --> 00:40.501
<i>It was right</i>
<i>in front of my eyes,</i>

00:40.503 --> 00:42.036
<i>and I never saw it coming.</i>

00:42.038 --> 00:45.239
<i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:45.241 --> 00:47.675
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:47.677 --> 00:51.846
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:57.519 --> 00:59.887
<i>You're the smartest</i>
<i>and the dumbest fucking person</i>

00:59.889 --> 01:01.889
<i>I've ever known.</i>

01:01.891 --> 01:03.557
<i>I'm not the
one who got it wrong.</i>

01:03.559 --> 01:05.860
<i>I'm the only one</i>
<i>who got it right.</i>

01:09.531 --> 01:11.432
<i>Take 'em.</i>

01:11.434 --> 01:13.434
<i>Take 'em all.</i>

01:20.234 --> 01:23.491
Homeland - 3x10
"Good Night"

01:24.412 --> 01:26.213
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

01:26.215 --> 01:28.649
The bomber's the only way
to prove that Brody's innocent.

01:28.651 --> 01:30.484
What the fuck
are you doing, Carrie?

01:31.386 --> 01:33.287
Carrie, turn around now.

01:33.289 --> 01:36.090
This is your last warning.

01:38.895 --> 01:41.395
<i>We got a gunshot wound
to the upper left bicep.</i>

01:41.397 --> 01:43.264
Significant bleeding.
Might have clipped an artery.

01:43.266 --> 01:44.965
Where the fuck is Saul?

01:50.739 --> 01:52.640
<i>He's not what we expected.</i>

01:52.642 --> 01:54.742
<i>But he's what we've got.</i>

01:54.744 --> 01:56.477
<i>The guy's a junkie... sir.</i>

01:56.479 --> 01:59.180
I'm offering you the chance
to be a Marine again.

01:59.182 --> 02:01.182
No more. I...

02:01.184 --> 02:03.083
I'm done.

02:03.085 --> 02:04.518
I have a play.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.320
It involves Brody.

02:06.322 --> 02:09.089
- You told me Javadi was the play.
- He is.

02:09.091 --> 02:10.758
Brody's the next phase.

02:10.759 --> 02:12.793
So, what is it?
What's your big idea?

02:12.795 --> 02:13.994
Darnish Akbari.

02:13.996 --> 02:15.930
Head of Iran's
Revolutionary Guard.

02:15.932 --> 02:17.164
Right.

02:17.166 --> 02:18.933
Javadi's boss.

02:18.935 --> 02:21.335
And the single greatest
impediment to peace.

02:21.337 --> 02:23.103
I want him gone.

02:23.105 --> 02:24.205
Brody can get to him.

02:24.207 --> 02:25.940
Do what Saul's asking.

02:25.942 --> 02:26.774
What you're asking.

02:26.776 --> 02:28.209
All right, what I'm asking.

02:28.211 --> 02:30.010
Look at me, Carrie.

02:30.012 --> 02:32.479
<i>You couldn't send me out for</i>
<i>a pack of cigarettes right now.</i>

02:32.481 --> 02:34.615
<i>We'll get you ready.</i>

02:34.617 --> 02:36.350
<i>You just have to be willing.</i>

02:36.352 --> 02:38.953
<i>The guys get me to the border</i>

02:38.955 --> 02:40.354
where I surrender myself?

02:40.356 --> 02:41.889
Correct, and we chose

02:41.891 --> 02:44.491
Marivan, because
several Al Qaeda commanders

02:44.493 --> 02:46.126
also asked
for political asylum there.

02:46.128 --> 02:48.195
What make you think
I'll ever get close enough

02:48.197 --> 02:49.630
to General Akbari
to take him out?

02:49.632 --> 02:50.898
Javadi's on the ground.

02:50.900 --> 02:52.666
We'll facilitate a meeting
between the two of you.

02:52.668 --> 02:54.501
<i>I will come back from Tehran.</i>

02:54.503 --> 02:56.470
<i>I know you will.</i>

02:56.472 --> 02:58.138
<i>And not just for her.</i>

03:01.810 --> 03:03.811
Brody?

03:06.381 --> 03:08.716
See you on the other side.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:26.835 --> 03:28.669
Carrie.

03:30.406 --> 03:32.006
We need to talk.

03:32.008 --> 03:33.274
What about?

03:33.276 --> 03:35.009
How's your shoulder?

03:35.011 --> 03:36.410
Brand fucking new.

03:36.412 --> 03:38.078
I want to clear the air

03:38.080 --> 03:40.214
after that clusterfuck
with Franklin at the motel.

03:40.216 --> 03:41.382
I'm not interested.

03:41.384 --> 03:42.850
I'm so tired of
all the bullshit

03:42.852 --> 03:45.352
and people covering their asses,
I can't even tell you.

03:45.354 --> 03:46.687
It was a direct order, Carrie.

03:46.689 --> 03:49.356
I didn't want to risk letting
someone else take the shot.

03:59.568 --> 04:01.568
While you were in surgery,

04:01.570 --> 04:04.204
I took a look
at your medical records.

04:04.206 --> 04:06.573
You what?!

04:06.575 --> 04:10.210
I was worried
about the damage I'd done.

04:12.548 --> 04:14.548
Carrie, you're
15 weeks pregnant.

04:14.550 --> 04:16.983
- So?
- So, I think

04:16.986 --> 04:19.586
you should consider sitting
this part of the operation out.

04:19.588 --> 04:21.120
And why would I do that?

04:21.123 --> 04:23.290
Because it's impossible
for you to be objective

04:23.292 --> 04:24.825
under the circumstances.

04:24.827 --> 04:27.227
The circumstances being,
I'm carrying Brody's child?

04:27.229 --> 04:29.063
Yes.

04:29.065 --> 04:31.966
Well, first of all,
it's not his,

04:31.968 --> 04:33.434
thank you very much.
Second of all,

04:33.436 --> 04:34.568
it's none of your
damn business,

04:34.570 --> 04:35.903
or anyone else's,

04:35.905 --> 04:37.838
so just stay the fuck
out of my way.

04:40.585 --> 04:43.996
_

04:55.490 --> 04:57.691
Medium rare?

05:00.095 --> 05:02.096
Hmm.

05:02.098 --> 05:04.298
Pretty fucking tasty, huh?

05:04.300 --> 05:06.767
Hmm... hmm. Yeah.

05:06.769 --> 05:10.204
The secret is to relax the goat

05:10.206 --> 05:12.039
before you cut his throat.

05:12.041 --> 05:14.608
Which is why Modarres
has lockjaw and sore knees.

05:34.729 --> 05:36.730
- How are they doing?
- Mm.

05:36.732 --> 05:40.000
Good. That move across
Kurdistan was uneventful.

05:40.002 --> 05:41.301
Now...

05:41.303 --> 05:44.671
that's them right there. They're waiting
for nightfall, at which point,

05:44.673 --> 05:46.140
they'll drive him
right up to the border

05:46.142 --> 05:48.575
here, cover him across
to the manned checkpoint

05:48.577 --> 05:51.045
on the Iranian side,
right there.

05:55.217 --> 05:57.551
<i>The risk</i>
<i>of an international incident</i>

05:57.553 --> 05:59.686
is a serious concern
for the President.

05:59.688 --> 06:04.091
We stand 100%
behind what we told him.

06:04.093 --> 06:06.994
The risk of this operation
is worth the reward.

06:06.996 --> 06:09.496
And in the unlikely event
anything goes wrong,

06:09.498 --> 06:11.265
we have it covered.

06:11.267 --> 06:15.169
I'm not even going to
ask what that means.

06:15.171 --> 06:16.570
All he has to do tonight

06:16.572 --> 06:19.273
is walk across the border
and ask for asylum.

06:19.275 --> 06:21.742
That's it.

06:26.514 --> 06:29.049
Is that a Marine thing?

06:29.051 --> 06:32.853
Turn the socks inside out,
get the fresh side.

06:32.855 --> 06:35.189
Well, there is no fresh side.

06:35.191 --> 06:37.724
One side's sweaty,
and the other's just dirty.

06:37.726 --> 06:40.928
Well, maybe it's just
all in my head.

06:42.263 --> 06:44.198
Does it work?

06:44.200 --> 06:46.533
Well, look at me.

06:46.535 --> 06:48.469
I'm a new man.

06:48.471 --> 06:49.870
Comms check.

07:01.383 --> 07:04.118
Kilo-Alpha, this is Zero.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.586
We have visual.

07:05.588 --> 07:07.488
Send signal strength. Over.

07:07.490 --> 07:09.223
Kilo-Alpha.

07:09.225 --> 07:10.891
Signal strength ten.

07:10.893 --> 07:13.794
Kilo-Bravo,
this is Zero. Over.

07:13.796 --> 07:15.229
Bravo. Also strength ten.

07:15.231 --> 07:17.197
Zero, this is Kilo-Alpha.

07:18.399 --> 07:20.501
New Moon, visibility good.

07:20.503 --> 07:22.803
Another day in paradise.

07:22.805 --> 07:24.505
How's the passenger doing?

07:24.507 --> 07:26.740
Not bad.

07:26.742 --> 07:29.476
For a fucking jarhead.

07:29.478 --> 07:32.246
That is all. Alpha out.

07:32.248 --> 07:33.981
Bravo out.

07:36.317 --> 07:39.086
What's he walking into
at the border crossing point?

07:39.088 --> 07:41.288
Hey, Gene, can you bring up
the border photos, please?

07:41.290 --> 07:42.823
Coming up.

07:44.359 --> 07:46.960
Yeah, as of two hours ago,

07:46.962 --> 07:49.496
one barrack hut for eight men,
commanded by a sergeant.

07:49.498 --> 07:51.932
Roadside guard hut manned
in four-hour shifts

07:51.934 --> 07:54.368
by two men with
automatic weapons.

07:54.370 --> 07:55.836
Any updates on the Iranian

07:55.838 --> 07:57.471
border patrol radio traffic?

07:57.473 --> 07:58.839
Hourly comms checks.

07:58.841 --> 08:00.607
Plus, one request
for more ration packs,

08:00.609 --> 08:02.209
two for new radio batteries.

08:02.211 --> 08:03.777
Eight bored
and hungry conscripts

08:03.779 --> 08:05.679
whose radios we're dialed into.

08:05.681 --> 08:08.182
No chance of
underestimating them then?

08:09.184 --> 08:11.318
Fair point.

08:11.320 --> 08:14.154
Let's go over your cover story

08:14.156 --> 08:16.190
one last time.

08:20.462 --> 08:22.229
After the bombing,

08:22.231 --> 08:25.132
Nazir's network left a car
near Langley,

08:25.134 --> 08:27.801
which I took into the woods
on the Canadian border,

08:27.803 --> 08:30.137
where I shaved my head,
and I continued on foot.

08:30.139 --> 08:32.139
There I stole a boat
across the Bay Of Fundy

08:32.140 --> 08:34.140
to Nova Scotia,
where I met a guy

08:34.143 --> 08:35.976
who had ties with Amer El-Maati,

08:35.977 --> 08:38.412
who put me in a shipping
container to Colombia.

08:38.414 --> 08:39.479
Mm-hmm.

08:39.481 --> 08:41.248
Then, mercenaries
working with Hezbollah

08:41.250 --> 08:43.750
took me across to Venezuela,
where they finally put me

08:43.751 --> 08:45.319
into a state oil company plane

08:45.321 --> 08:46.486
to a strip in Iraq,

08:46.488 --> 08:48.822
where I was handed over
to an Al Qaeda cell

08:48.824 --> 08:52.125
who were tasked with getting me
across the border to Iran.

08:54.862 --> 08:57.397
Join Al Qaeda, see the world.

09:00.001 --> 09:02.102
Final checks. Night vision.

09:05.506 --> 09:07.808
Night vision transmissions
coming online.

09:31.734 --> 09:33.233
I'm out of Black Jack.

09:33.235 --> 09:35.269
Any more out there?

09:39.540 --> 09:41.541
Everything okay, sir?

09:41.543 --> 09:42.876
This the last pack?

09:42.878 --> 09:44.444
I got you plenty more.

09:44.446 --> 09:46.446
Don't worry.

09:55.089 --> 09:57.858
Did you write a letter?

09:58.660 --> 10:00.594
What?

10:00.596 --> 10:02.229
Home.

10:02.231 --> 10:04.564
To say good-bye.

10:07.335 --> 10:10.003
Pretty sure you guys
would know if I did.

10:10.005 --> 10:12.072
You could've arranged it

10:12.074 --> 10:16.076
with your, uh, CIA friend,
the blonde.

10:28.590 --> 10:30.924
How you doing?

10:30.926 --> 10:32.459
Good. You?

10:32.461 --> 10:35.595
Feel like I'm in Vegas
betting the mortgage.

10:35.597 --> 10:37.597
Stand by, people.

10:37.599 --> 10:39.099
Show time.

10:39.101 --> 10:41.601
What's going on with Reaper 1?

10:41.603 --> 10:43.704
Sensor bandwidth issues.

10:43.706 --> 10:45.405
It happens.
We're resetting.

10:47.275 --> 10:50.811
All being well, shouldn't
be more than a couple minutes.

10:50.813 --> 10:52.045
"All being well"?

10:52.047 --> 10:53.280
Are we holding the team back

10:53.282 --> 10:54.715
until the drone's back on line?

10:54.717 --> 10:55.816
That drone's mainly for us.

10:55.818 --> 10:57.150
They have satphones
and night vision.

10:57.152 --> 11:00.620
They can move closer to the
border without it for now.

12:39.053 --> 12:40.887
- Shit.
- What?

12:40.889 --> 12:43.056
Road to the border's
as good as blocked.

12:43.058 --> 12:47.093
Foreign gas trucks paying off
local officials with free gas.

12:47.095 --> 12:50.297
Cops, military, you name it,
all on the take.

12:51.632 --> 12:53.433
Where's the border?

12:53.435 --> 12:55.302
Another mile past 'em
on this same road.

12:55.304 --> 12:57.571
Those lights in the distance.

13:00.242 --> 13:02.943
Zero, Kilo-Alpha, over.

13:02.945 --> 13:04.077
Zero send, over.

13:04.079 --> 13:05.645
See what I'm seeing?

13:05.647 --> 13:08.381
Yeah. Wait out.

13:10.651 --> 13:12.619
Guys, get out.

13:12.621 --> 13:16.156
Make it look like car trouble
for anybody passing.

13:22.430 --> 13:24.664
We have a backup plan, right?

13:24.666 --> 13:28.668
Yeah. We're waiting for Langley
to confirm the alternate route.

13:30.872 --> 13:32.939
Now, I need that drone.
Are we gonna have it or not?

13:32.941 --> 13:34.574
Copy that.

13:41.450 --> 13:43.884
What's taking them so long?

13:43.886 --> 13:47.454
I don't know. They had
a technical with the drone.

13:47.456 --> 13:51.057
So how long are we gonna
sit here for?

13:51.059 --> 13:53.560
Shit, man,
you're worse than my kids.

13:53.562 --> 13:56.296
God, those rear echelon
motherfuckers.

13:56.298 --> 13:58.298
Got a problem with the drone.

13:58.300 --> 14:00.767
That's a good start.

14:02.803 --> 14:04.137
Reaper's back.

14:04.139 --> 14:06.540
Good.

14:06.542 --> 14:08.808
Now let's get eyes

14:08.810 --> 14:11.044
on that alternate
route into the border.

14:11.046 --> 14:12.913
Repositioning now.

14:12.915 --> 14:14.314
Kilo-Alpha, Zero.

14:14.316 --> 14:16.383
Drone is back online.
Scouting your route.

14:17.585 --> 14:18.585
Wait out.

14:20.588 --> 14:23.323
Back to chewing
your lucky gum again?

14:23.325 --> 14:25.559
Yeah. You want a stick?

14:42.677 --> 14:44.678
Shit.

14:49.917 --> 14:52.285
Put your head down.

14:52.287 --> 14:54.688
Like you're sleeping.
Don't move.

15:00.361 --> 15:03.763
Zero, Kilo-Bravo. Stand by.

15:03.765 --> 15:05.532
May have a situation
with the Alpha vehicle.

15:05.534 --> 15:07.601
Local cops just rolled up.

15:16.979 --> 15:18.244
Maghreb.

15:19.715 --> 15:21.214
Why are you here?

15:22.651 --> 15:24.784
Going to Marivan.

15:37.332 --> 15:40.066
...Al Qaeda.

15:40.068 --> 15:43.336
They're not
buying the cover story.

15:47.809 --> 15:49.709
Jesus, they want to look
in the truck.

15:54.982 --> 15:56.516
Say the word,
Kilo-Alpha.

15:56.518 --> 15:59.085
- What word?
- "Good night."

15:59.087 --> 16:02.822
They should say "Good night"
before the cops see Brody.

16:11.866 --> 16:14.834
<i>As-salamu alaykum.</i>

16:49.804 --> 16:51.671
Good... night.

17:17.665 --> 17:19.898
Hey...

17:19.901 --> 17:21.401
You okay?

17:23.404 --> 17:25.605
Brody? You good?

17:31.079 --> 17:33.279
Hey.

17:45.059 --> 17:48.261
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I can't do it.

17:48.263 --> 17:49.696
- Yes, you can.
- I can't. No.

17:49.698 --> 17:51.564
- I can't. No, I fucking can't.
- And you will.

17:51.566 --> 17:53.533
I fucking can't. I fucking...

17:53.535 --> 17:56.035
Bit late in the day
for your vagina to chime in.

17:56.037 --> 17:58.037
Fuck off...

18:01.242 --> 18:03.042
You scared?

18:03.044 --> 18:05.278
Are you fucking scared?

18:05.280 --> 18:08.381
Mm-hmm. Mmm. I'm...

18:08.383 --> 18:10.917
- I'm scared. I'm scared.
- Good.

18:10.919 --> 18:13.586
Me, too. I've seen
way too many men

18:13.588 --> 18:15.221
killed out here in this
third world toilet.

18:15.223 --> 18:17.724
I personally shit myself every
time they send me back here.

18:17.726 --> 18:20.260
And if you don't snap out
of this right now

18:20.262 --> 18:22.228
we could all fucking die
here tonight.

18:22.230 --> 18:24.130
Is that what you want?

18:24.132 --> 18:26.065
No.

18:26.067 --> 18:28.735
Tell me you're gonna be okay.

18:28.737 --> 18:32.438
Tell me that this is not
the end of the road for you.

18:33.909 --> 18:38.678
No, no, no...
I need to hear you say it.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.780
I'll be...

18:40.782 --> 18:43.616
I will be okay. I'm okay.

18:43.618 --> 18:46.019
I'm okay.

18:46.021 --> 18:48.021
I'll be okay.

18:56.197 --> 18:58.832
Kilo-Alpha, is there a problem?

19:02.503 --> 19:04.671
Passenger got carsick.
He threw up

19:04.673 --> 19:06.139
and we're ready to roll.

19:06.141 --> 19:07.540
Carsick?

19:07.542 --> 19:09.609
It's a secure sat link.
Can you tell them to just

19:09.611 --> 19:12.178
- cut the bullshit?
- Is he gonna be okay?

19:12.180 --> 19:14.681
Fuckin'-A he's gonna be okay.

19:17.885 --> 19:19.452
Here.

19:19.454 --> 19:21.120
Wipe the blood off your face.

19:21.122 --> 19:22.989
Kilo-Alpha,

19:22.991 --> 19:26.192
Kilo-Bravo, proceed
to alternate crossing point.

19:26.194 --> 19:28.194
Roger.

19:28.196 --> 19:29.896
Alpha out.

19:40.307 --> 19:43.243
Did we or did we not just kill
three Iraqi police officers?

19:43.245 --> 19:45.411
Kurdish-- not to split hairs.

19:45.413 --> 19:49.883
Either way, this isn't something
the President needs to know.

19:49.885 --> 19:52.151
Oh, I understand.
Believe me.

19:53.721 --> 19:55.989
Get me JSOC Commander now.

20:23.217 --> 20:25.551
This whole area is
pretty much a no-man's land

20:25.553 --> 20:27.687
since the Iran-Iraq war.

20:27.689 --> 20:29.589
We got visitors.

20:39.867 --> 20:41.701
- Senator. General.
- Director.

20:41.703 --> 20:43.102
- The White House...
- I know.

20:43.104 --> 20:44.904
- I was told you were coming.
- Let me finish.

20:44.906 --> 20:46.940
The White House sent
General Pfister and me

20:46.942 --> 20:48.308
to advise and observe.

20:48.310 --> 20:50.910
Advise and observe.

20:50.912 --> 20:54.047
The JSOC Commander, to advise;
myself, the President's nomin...

20:54.049 --> 20:55.949
What did Higgins tell you
about the operation?

20:55.951 --> 21:00.820
That this part was meant to be
quick and silent and bloodless.

21:00.822 --> 21:02.555
He told you everything,
didn't he?

21:02.557 --> 21:03.990
Yes, he did.

21:03.992 --> 21:06.559
- Including...?
- Sergeant Brody, yes.

21:07.394 --> 21:08.928
Saul...

21:08.930 --> 21:10.830
whatever this turns out to be,

21:10.832 --> 21:13.232
bold stroke of genius
or otherwise,

21:13.234 --> 21:15.335
I'm destined to inherit it.

21:15.337 --> 21:17.236
So now that it's actually
in motion,

21:17.238 --> 21:18.905
for better or for worse,

21:18.907 --> 21:22.542
I have no choice
but to wish it every success.

21:26.613 --> 21:28.348
A word in private, Senator?

21:28.350 --> 21:30.083
Excuse us, Bill.

21:30.085 --> 21:31.217
Of course.

21:42.296 --> 21:44.931
What about the breathing room
you agreed to give me?

21:44.933 --> 21:47.967
The deal was that I delay
my confirmation hearing,

21:47.969 --> 21:48.935
which I've done.

21:48.937 --> 21:50.937
That obligation
has been fulfilled.

21:50.939 --> 21:53.306
Consider yourself lucky, Saul,

21:53.308 --> 21:55.875
that Higgins called us
and not the President

21:55.877 --> 21:59.012
or his National
Security Advisor.

22:03.450 --> 22:05.118
Copy that.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.086
Copy.

22:08.722 --> 22:11.190
- Ms. Mathison.
- Senator.

22:11.192 --> 22:13.526
How's your shoulder?

22:13.528 --> 22:16.396
Doctor told me you
were very lucky.

22:16.398 --> 22:18.798
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

22:18.800 --> 22:23.369
All I can say is you must be
one hell of a salesperson

22:23.371 --> 22:25.204
to get Brody to do this.

22:25.206 --> 22:29.609
Here at the Agency,
we call that recruiting.

22:38.719 --> 22:41.788
Here. Take a look.

22:43.690 --> 22:45.324
Border's a click
and a half away.

22:45.326 --> 22:47.660
300 yards past that building.

22:47.662 --> 22:50.830
All it is is a shallow stream,
12 yards across.

22:50.832 --> 22:53.566
Listen... I'm gonna
drive you right up to it

22:53.568 --> 22:54.934
and we're all gonna
be watching you.

22:56.337 --> 22:59.672
You way across that river and you head
up to that treeline on the other side.

22:59.674 --> 23:01.841
Once you hit it, follow
it north for three miles

23:01.843 --> 23:03.009
back to the Iranian checkpoint

23:03.011 --> 23:05.244
where we were
originally gonna drop you.

23:08.849 --> 23:10.216
Hey, where you going?

23:10.218 --> 23:11.684
Piss.

23:11.686 --> 23:13.920
Go with him.

23:16.557 --> 23:18.357
We got potential bogeys.

23:18.359 --> 23:20.026
Two Iraqi army hummers

23:20.028 --> 23:22.562
three clicks south
of our call sign.

23:22.564 --> 23:25.398
Kilo-Alpha, we have
two Iraqi hummers

23:25.400 --> 23:29.936
three clicks south, it's not a
significant threat but be aware.

23:29.938 --> 23:31.537
Alpha Roger.

23:31.539 --> 23:34.373
All right, we got an Iraqi
patrol three clicks south.

23:34.375 --> 23:37.543
It's not that big a deal but
it's difficult terrain out there

23:37.545 --> 23:39.045
so we got to move quick, quiet

23:39.047 --> 23:41.881
and small now, which means
it's just me and him from here.

23:41.883 --> 23:44.584
Rest of you guys stay here,
cover from this position.

23:44.586 --> 23:46.285
Questions?

23:50.557 --> 23:51.958
Ready?

23:52.759 --> 23:54.794
Yeah.

24:11.830 --> 24:14.013
When you were a little kid,
what did you want to be when you grew up?

24:15.849 --> 24:17.250
I don't remember.

24:17.252 --> 24:18.351
Bullshit.

24:18.353 --> 24:20.319
Everyone remembers.

24:24.091 --> 24:27.026
You don't
have to manage me anymore, man.

24:27.028 --> 24:29.028
I know what I'm here to do.

24:29.030 --> 24:31.998
Just making conversation's all.

24:33.267 --> 24:35.001
What's that?

24:36.971 --> 24:38.437
Nothing.

24:48.448 --> 24:50.216
Well, what did you want to be?

24:50.218 --> 24:51.684
I grew up in Texas.

24:51.686 --> 24:54.020
All I wanted to do
was ride bulls.

24:54.022 --> 24:55.688
Yeah, why didn't you?

24:55.690 --> 24:56.822
I did.

24:56.824 --> 24:58.791
Two years.

24:58.793 --> 25:00.793
But my nuts couldn't
take the beating.

25:03.530 --> 25:05.498
So now I do this.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.666
Happy fucking...

25:23.550 --> 25:25.218
What just happened?

25:26.220 --> 25:28.955
Kilo-Alpha,
this is Zero, over.

25:31.491 --> 25:34.894
Kilo-Alpha, this is Zero, over.

25:36.330 --> 25:38.431
Kilo-Alpha, Zero, over.

25:41.501 --> 25:43.002
Zero, this is Kilo-Bravo.

25:43.004 --> 25:44.604
Alpha hit something.

25:44.606 --> 25:46.439
A mine or an IED.

25:47.608 --> 25:50.176
Any hostiles on your screens?

25:50.178 --> 25:51.811
Stand by. Checking now.

25:54.615 --> 25:56.315
Nothing, so far.

26:05.859 --> 26:07.360
Sir, that Iraqi patrol

26:07.362 --> 26:09.462
just turned north,
towards the explosion.

26:12.132 --> 26:13.699
Now we have to call
the President.

26:13.701 --> 26:15.935
Wait.
Let the dust settle first.

26:15.937 --> 26:18.037
No, any possibility of
an international incident

26:18.039 --> 26:20.573
- I must call the President.
- What you must do

26:20.575 --> 26:22.041
is keep a cool head

26:22.043 --> 26:24.043
and take great care
not to panic.

26:24.045 --> 26:26.245
Well, we at least have
to call the Iraqis.

26:26.247 --> 26:27.413
And say what?

26:27.415 --> 26:29.448
Turn your patrol around,
we have a CIA team

26:29.450 --> 26:31.784
we didn't tell you about,
operating in the area?

26:37.658 --> 26:40.059
That drone is armed, correct?

26:40.061 --> 26:41.060
Zero, Kilo-Bravo.

26:41.062 --> 26:43.129
We're one click out
from Kilo-Alpha.

26:43.131 --> 26:45.264
Roger, Kilo-Bravo, be advised

26:45.266 --> 26:47.933
that Iraqi patrol is closing
on your position.

26:47.935 --> 26:51.971
Sir, White House
is on the line.

26:53.473 --> 26:55.408
Put him on the screen.

26:55.410 --> 26:56.942
Mike.

26:56.944 --> 26:59.445
- I may have a solution.
- Please.

26:59.447 --> 27:03.082
That drone has four
Hellfire missiles on it.

27:03.084 --> 27:05.284
You saying we engage
the Iraqi patrol?

27:05.286 --> 27:08.354
I'm saying we just found
an Al Qaeda cell

27:08.356 --> 27:11.857
trying to smuggle America's most
wanted terrorist into Iran

27:11.859 --> 27:14.126
and we take them out
with that drone.

27:14.128 --> 27:14.994
Jesus.

27:14.996 --> 27:17.430
It's a smart play
if they're dead.

27:19.766 --> 27:23.202
- And if they're not dead? - He doesn't
care whether they're dead or alive,

27:23.204 --> 27:26.339
all he fucking gives a shit
about is covering his own ass.

27:26.341 --> 27:28.607
- Bite your lip, Carrie. Bite it hard.
- Fuck.

27:30.043 --> 27:33.512
That Iraqi patrol is,
what, a minute away?

27:34.514 --> 27:37.350
Let me be very clear, Mike.

27:39.386 --> 27:42.355
I will not order
a strike on our own men.

27:44.191 --> 27:46.192
Hang it up.

27:48.995 --> 27:51.197
We've got movement
in the Alpha vehicle.

28:20.193 --> 28:21.427
Either the vehicle just settled

28:21.429 --> 28:23.929
or I have a second
heat signature moving.

28:32.339 --> 28:34.039
The second figure is moving.

28:34.041 --> 28:36.575
They're alive;
they're both alive.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.194
My leg.

28:55.196 --> 28:57.263
Motherfucker...

28:58.533 --> 29:00.466
No.

29:01.802 --> 29:03.903
- My fucking leg...
- All right, sit up.

29:03.905 --> 29:06.539
Sit up, sit up.

29:06.541 --> 29:07.907
Fold your arms.

29:07.909 --> 29:10.743
Okay, come with me.

29:10.745 --> 29:12.945
All right...

29:20.120 --> 29:22.321
Phone, satphone.

29:27.828 --> 29:30.496
- Kilo-Bravo, this is Alpha, over.
- Bravo, send.

29:30.498 --> 29:33.466
We're in the building
to the west of the border,

29:33.468 --> 29:35.734
no enemy fire;
casualty is still conscious

29:35.736 --> 29:37.736
but he's lost a leg
and a lot of blood, over.

29:37.738 --> 29:40.439
Bravo, Roger.
Your location 60 seconds, over.

29:40.441 --> 29:42.842
Get a gun team
up on high ground.

29:42.844 --> 29:46.278
I can treat for shock
and stem the blood flow for now.

29:46.280 --> 29:50.449
Take your time to follow
our exact route in, over.

29:50.451 --> 29:52.485
On it. Out.

30:08.668 --> 30:10.269
Focus on your kids.

30:10.271 --> 30:12.471
I don't have any kids, dumbass.

30:12.473 --> 30:16.876
Making small talk 'cause
you were being a fucking baby.

30:19.779 --> 30:21.514
We're gonna get you out of here.

30:35.028 --> 30:36.962
Smoke.

30:36.964 --> 30:39.632
Here, give me some
of my cigarettes.

30:50.511 --> 30:54.013
I never thought I'd
be this fucking guy.

30:54.015 --> 30:56.215
No, me neither.

31:00.186 --> 31:02.054
I guess I fucked up, T.

31:02.056 --> 31:04.323
Beers on you, then.

31:04.325 --> 31:05.691
I gave him one morphine shot.

31:05.693 --> 31:06.692
He's got one left.

31:06.694 --> 31:08.027
We got to haul ass now.

31:08.029 --> 31:10.496
Grab that.

31:14.067 --> 31:16.669
Here. Here... here.

31:16.671 --> 31:19.171
Roll... back.

31:19.173 --> 31:20.506
Okay.

31:22.609 --> 31:24.209
- Ready to do this, boss?
- Yeah.

31:24.211 --> 31:27.046
All right, everybody
back to the truck.

31:27.048 --> 31:28.614
- Go!
- Let's go, quick.

31:33.687 --> 31:36.155
Iraqi patrol
just joined the party.

31:48.201 --> 31:51.637
Zero, Kilo-Bravo, contact!
Automatic fire from the south.

31:51.639 --> 31:53.305
Platoon or possible
company strength.

31:59.613 --> 32:01.580
Do all you can
not to escalate this.

32:01.582 --> 32:04.249
Suppressive return fire.
Suppressive fire only.

32:04.251 --> 32:06.585
Don't put them in the ground.
Just turn them around.

32:06.587 --> 32:09.922
Zero, Kilo-Bravo,
we don't get Aziz out

32:09.924 --> 32:12.658
- in the next few minutes, he's dead.
- Iraqi call signs

32:12.660 --> 32:15.127
are requesting an artillery fire
mission up the chain.

32:15.129 --> 32:16.795
How far out are
our helicopters?

32:16.797 --> 32:18.998
Eight minutes.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.399
General, advice?

32:20.401 --> 32:22.001
Eight minutes
is time we don't have.

32:22.003 --> 32:24.570
- Either we call the Iraqis and level with
them... - Also time we don't have

32:24.572 --> 32:26.271
and every shade of blowback
we can't afford.

32:26.273 --> 32:29.241
So it's a fighting withdrawal
to a secure LZ,

32:29.243 --> 32:32.144
back five clicks in the vehicle
that they have left.

32:37.083 --> 32:38.851
In other words,
we have to abort.

32:44.491 --> 32:46.091
The intelligence
operation is over.

32:46.093 --> 32:48.293
It's a military one now.
It's all yours, General.

32:48.295 --> 32:49.595
Thank you, sir.

32:49.597 --> 32:50.929
Shoot the boys out of there.

32:50.931 --> 32:52.431
Copy that. Comms.

33:03.043 --> 33:04.843
Kilo Bravo, this is Zero-Alpha.

33:04.845 --> 33:06.345
Bravo, send.

33:06.347 --> 33:09.448
- We're going to push them back
with Hellfire, over. - Roger.

33:09.450 --> 33:12.017
Withdraw with Hellfire
in support on your command.

33:12.019 --> 33:13.619
On my command, roger, wait.

33:13.621 --> 33:16.555
Are they aborting the mission?

33:21.194 --> 33:22.294
Saul.

33:24.164 --> 33:26.699
You had some bad luck.

33:26.701 --> 33:28.300
I'm sorry.

33:33.807 --> 33:34.773
Hey.

33:35.508 --> 33:36.875
At least we have Javadi.

33:36.877 --> 33:39.712
He's still in play.
That's not nothing.

33:40.747 --> 33:42.548
Yeah.

34:04.671 --> 34:07.005
Stand by for Hellfire
mission, over.

34:07.007 --> 34:08.005
You guys ready?

34:09.844 --> 34:12.110
Fall back! Fall back!

34:12.112 --> 34:15.681
- I'm not gonna go back. - What the fuck
are you talking about? Yeah, you are.

34:15.683 --> 34:18.016
I'm gonna walk across that border into
Iran and you're not gonna to stop...

34:18.018 --> 34:21.386
Listen to me! I am fucking ordering
you to fucking move out!

34:26.025 --> 34:27.359
Passenger refuses to withdraw,

34:27.360 --> 34:29.862
and I'm out of time.
Please advise.

34:29.864 --> 34:32.030
Do not leave anyone behind.

34:32.032 --> 34:33.599
We are under heavy fire!

34:33.601 --> 34:35.701
The casualty is priority one,

34:35.703 --> 34:37.436
and the passenger is
non-fucking-compliant!

34:40.540 --> 34:43.708
General, please advise!

34:43.710 --> 34:45.543
Let me talk to him.

34:45.545 --> 34:48.313
If anyone can talk Brody
down off a ledge, she can.

34:50.884 --> 34:52.317
All right.

34:54.554 --> 34:57.422
Put the passenger on the line.

34:57.424 --> 35:00.159
I say again,
put the passenger on the line.

35:00.161 --> 35:02.561
Take this.

35:02.563 --> 35:05.330
Take it!

35:05.332 --> 35:07.232
Brody?

35:07.234 --> 35:08.567
Brody?

35:08.569 --> 35:11.236
Brody, can you hear me?

35:11.238 --> 35:15.073
- Hey, Brody! - They're trying
to abort the mission, Carrie!

35:15.075 --> 35:18.076
- I know.
- Well, tell them to go fuck themselves.

35:18.078 --> 35:19.244
No, listen to me.

35:19.246 --> 35:21.580
You can't do this by yourself.

35:21.582 --> 35:23.749
I'm 300 yards
from the border, Carrie.

35:23.751 --> 35:25.584
I can make it.

35:25.586 --> 35:28.120
You cross into Iran now and you will
be completely on your own.

35:28.122 --> 35:30.689
Well, to be honest I don't see
much of an option here.

35:30.691 --> 35:32.758
The option is
to fall back, regroup,

35:32.760 --> 35:34.793
and we'll take another shot
at this later.

35:34.795 --> 35:38.197
Come on, Carrie, you know
that's not gonna happen.

35:38.199 --> 35:40.999
You don't know that!

35:41.001 --> 35:43.001
Now, stop and think
this through.

35:43.003 --> 35:45.337
You have no sanction,
no support on the ground,

35:45.339 --> 35:47.539
and no extraction plan.

35:49.542 --> 35:52.110
You will die over there!

35:52.112 --> 35:53.612
No, you're wrong, Carrie.

35:55.216 --> 35:57.282
And you want to know why?

35:57.284 --> 35:58.684
'Cause you're gonna get me home.

35:58.686 --> 36:00.953
No, don't say that!
Do not put that on me.

36:00.955 --> 36:02.120
It's a fantasy.

36:02.122 --> 36:03.322
You'll find a way.

36:03.324 --> 36:05.023
I have faith.

36:05.025 --> 36:06.458
That's all. Out.

36:06.460 --> 36:07.893
No, Brody! Brody!

36:13.234 --> 36:15.467
Fuck!

36:15.469 --> 36:17.236
We are fucking moving out now.

36:17.238 --> 36:18.337
All of us. Let's go.

36:18.339 --> 36:20.472
Not me.

36:54.674 --> 36:56.675
He's gone! Fuck him!

36:56.677 --> 36:59.077
Hellfire, now! Hellfire, now!

36:59.079 --> 37:02.080
Hellfire firing now.

37:08.521 --> 37:10.155
Move. Move now!

37:11.891 --> 37:12.724
Grab him!

37:18.999 --> 37:20.866
- Take it.
- What are you doing?

37:20.868 --> 37:23.735
Get him to the LZ,
then come get me. Go!

37:23.737 --> 37:25.771
Fuck!

37:37.450 --> 37:38.884
Fucking snipers.

37:38.886 --> 37:41.653
Always the stubborn
fucking assholes.

37:43.990 --> 37:46.091
I can buy you 30 seconds
to cross that border

37:46.093 --> 37:47.392
and get to those trees.

37:47.394 --> 37:48.727
Once I start firing,
you start running.

37:48.729 --> 37:50.896
And if you stop,
I'll fucking shoot you myself.

37:50.898 --> 37:52.731
Any questions?

37:52.733 --> 37:54.466
- No.
- Oh, good.

37:54.468 --> 37:56.301
Count of three.

37:56.303 --> 37:59.137
One... two... three!

38:09.615 --> 38:10.615
What is that?

38:10.617 --> 38:11.817
They're surrounded.

38:11.819 --> 38:12.918
Who by?

38:12.920 --> 38:14.820
Are we picking up
anything on radios?

38:16.622 --> 38:19.558
...Nicholas Brody.

38:23.390 --> 38:25.465
_

38:25.466 --> 38:27.261
_

38:27.262 --> 38:28.848
_

38:28.849 --> 38:32.312
_

38:35.689 --> 38:37.304
_

38:37.305 --> 38:39.012
_

38:39.013 --> 38:39.921
_

38:39.922 --> 38:41.092
_

38:57.997 --> 39:02.067
The Iranians are saying
they have two prisoners.

39:02.069 --> 39:04.369
Are we sure it's the Iranians
and not the Iraqis?

39:04.371 --> 39:06.471
100%.

39:06.473 --> 39:08.740
Jesus.

39:29.195 --> 39:30.996
They got the
casualty out safely.

39:30.998 --> 39:34.766
He's stable, on a bird
out to the carrier group now.

39:38.704 --> 39:40.439
There's something else.

39:40.441 --> 39:42.641
What?

39:44.410 --> 39:47.079
Brody made it across.

39:50.249 --> 39:51.583
How?

39:51.585 --> 39:53.251
He made a last second
run for it--

39:53.253 --> 39:55.987
headfirst
into an Iranian military unit.

39:57.390 --> 39:59.191
He's okay?

39:59.193 --> 40:01.293
Yes.

40:10.037 --> 40:11.369
He made it.

40:11.371 --> 40:12.604
And you, Saul,

40:12.606 --> 40:15.407
are still in the game.

40:15.409 --> 40:18.376
I'll be damned.

40:30.623 --> 40:32.791
Right now, these guys...

40:32.793 --> 40:35.494
uh, they're trained
to treat anybody coming

40:35.496 --> 40:37.696
over the border
as Israeli agents.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.368
You were tortured...

40:45.905 --> 40:48.073
so tell me what to expect.

40:51.244 --> 40:53.245
Expect to break.

41:03.422 --> 41:05.390
How long did you hold out?

41:06.692 --> 41:09.327
I don't know.

41:09.329 --> 41:11.530
I lost track of time
pretty much right away,

41:11.532 --> 41:13.532
but I figure...

41:13.534 --> 41:15.967
seven days?

41:15.969 --> 41:17.269
Enough time to allow the guys

41:17.271 --> 41:20.906
to change their frequencies
and battle plans.

41:22.441 --> 41:25.110
I just...

41:25.112 --> 41:27.112
I just hope
I can give you seven days

41:27.114 --> 41:29.281
to get the job done in Tehran.

41:29.283 --> 41:31.283
Huh?

41:57.476 --> 41:59.077
Hi.

41:59.079 --> 42:00.145
May I?

42:00.147 --> 42:02.147
Of course.

42:05.918 --> 42:09.154
Fara, you're one of the few
people in this building

42:09.156 --> 42:11.723
who knows that Majid Javadi's
an Agency asset.

42:11.725 --> 42:13.058
I didn't breathe
a word to anybody.

42:13.060 --> 42:16.228
I know you didn't--
that's not why I'm here.

42:16.230 --> 42:19.197
But you had a crucial role
in recruiting Javadi.

42:19.199 --> 42:22.334
In fact, Saul says, without you,
it never would've come off.

42:22.336 --> 42:24.336
He's exaggerating.

42:24.338 --> 42:26.004
But thank you.

42:27.540 --> 42:30.008
The thing is...

42:30.010 --> 42:32.777
Javadi's only half the play.

42:32.779 --> 42:34.446
There's another phase
of the operation

42:34.448 --> 42:35.614
you weren't made aware of.

42:35.616 --> 42:38.350
It involves an asset,
whose life depends

42:38.352 --> 42:41.086
on us getting him out of Iran
at the critical moment.

42:41.088 --> 42:43.288
And the fact is
our extraction plan

42:43.290 --> 42:45.523
just went up in smoke.

42:45.525 --> 42:47.859
I'm sorry.

42:49.061 --> 42:51.863
Fara, you have
an uncle in Tehran.

42:51.865 --> 42:54.032
Your father's brother.

42:54.034 --> 42:55.967
- Carrie, no.
- Just hear me out.

42:55.969 --> 42:57.902
No, it's too dangerous.

42:57.904 --> 42:59.537
- All we're asking for...
- You're asking me

42:59.539 --> 43:01.039
to put my family
at extreme risk.

43:01.041 --> 43:03.308
You know you are.

43:03.310 --> 43:05.043
You forget I've seen firsthand

43:05.045 --> 43:08.146
how fast an operation
can go sideways.

43:09.715 --> 43:11.883
Tell the truth.

43:11.885 --> 43:14.786
You would never ask your
own family to do this.

43:14.788 --> 43:17.589
I might.

43:17.591 --> 43:20.091
And from what I know about
your uncle, he's not one

43:20.093 --> 43:22.160
to cross the street to stay
out of trouble's way.

43:22.162 --> 43:24.729
He's a member of a moderate
opposition group.

43:24.731 --> 43:26.431
Not a bomb thrower.

43:26.433 --> 43:28.667
All we need is a place
to meet in the city.

43:28.669 --> 43:30.468
A de facto safe house.

43:35.275 --> 43:37.842
Fara, we have a brother agent
in the field,

43:37.844 --> 43:41.012
soon to be in mortal danger.

43:41.014 --> 43:44.349
Don't we owe him every chance
to get out alive?

44:00.766 --> 44:02.334
Hey.

44:13.146 --> 44:15.914
Someone's coming.
Someone's coming.

44:35.301 --> 44:38.837
My name is Nicholas Brody...

44:38.839 --> 44:40.972
and I'm formally seeking asylum

44:40.974 --> 44:44.743
in the islamic Republic of Iran.

44:44.745 --> 44:46.578
I know who you are.

44:49.750 --> 44:50.749
Ayman Jassim.

45:02.996 --> 45:04.996
Are you ready?

45:04.998 --> 45:07.065
Ready for what?

45:07.067 --> 45:09.267
To go with me to Tehran.

45:12.037 --> 45:15.673
What about him?

45:16.842 --> 45:18.209
No! You fuck!

45:18.211 --> 45:19.911
- Quiet. Quiet!
- You fucking asshole!

45:19.913 --> 45:22.046
- What did you do that for?!
- Control yourself.

45:22.048 --> 45:24.682
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Calm down!

45:24.684 --> 45:27.752
Calm down.

45:43.302 --> 45:45.537
Now.

45:45.539 --> 45:48.039
We go to Tehran.
