<i> Previously on</i> Greenleaf...

00:01.734 --> 00:03.180
- Hello?
- Hey, baby.

00:03.213 --> 00:04.653
- Where are you?
- It's better

00:04.685 --> 00:05.870
if you don't know where I'm at.

00:05.901 --> 00:07.757
I'm never gonna see you again, am I?

00:07.788 --> 00:10.382
- Just tell me you love me.
- I love you.

00:10.413 --> 00:12.430
<i>Baby, when it comes to the Greenleafs,</i>

00:12.460 --> 00:13.581
make 'em pay.

00:13.613 --> 00:15.470
I just want you to know that

00:15.502 --> 00:17.230
I'm here to do whatever I can do

00:17.260 --> 00:18.765
to make your job easier.

00:18.797 --> 00:20.442
That's why I stayed on.

00:20.475 --> 00:21.684
That's great.

00:21.715 --> 00:23.917
Tamela Mann asked me
to sing backup for her

00:23.949 --> 00:26.004
on her national tour.

00:26.051 --> 00:28.803
- Seriously?
- Yes, Jabari just called to tell me.

00:28.835 --> 00:30.530
I can't make one move
without this one shading me.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.159
I just think it's really remarkable

00:32.191 --> 00:34.146
how everything is always about you.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.452
- Isaiah.
- Get off of me!

00:36.483 --> 00:37.430
Ow!

00:37.462 --> 00:38.402
I promise you

00:38.434 --> 00:40.933
I will never do this again.

00:40.958 --> 00:42.367
'Cause I love you.

00:42.398 --> 00:43.870
I'm so glad that God

00:43.902 --> 00:45.215
decided to put you in my life.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.941
And thank you for being open

00:46.973 --> 00:48.029
to letting Him do that.

00:48.060 --> 00:49.982
I know you had an affair with Lionel.

00:50.014 --> 00:52.290
I used passion to fill

00:52.321 --> 00:54.660
the pit of pain you left in me

00:54.693 --> 00:56.551
with what you did with my sister.

00:56.552 --> 00:58.276

04:51.845 --> 04:54.757
- Maricel.
- Yes, Ms. Greenleaf?

04:54.789 --> 04:57.509
- I wanted...
- Uh, I have my fitting at 11:00

04:57.542 --> 04:58.821
and then me and Roberto
are going to Burke's

04:58.854 --> 05:00.294
- for the book signing.
- Great, good.

05:00.325 --> 05:01.573
- Okay.
- Bye. Have fun.

05:01.604 --> 05:02.933
Thanks.

05:03.524 --> 05:05.637
Now, where are you going
with these suits?

05:05.669 --> 05:08.132
- The guest suite.
- Why?

05:08.165 --> 05:10.567
Bishop told me to move all of his
clothes out the master bedroom.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.285
Oh!

05:25.317 --> 05:26.885
It was a double-strand,

05:26.917 --> 05:29.478
but I had it separated so
the two of you could share.

05:29.509 --> 05:30.758
Thank you, Grandma.

05:30.790 --> 05:33.125
Yes, thank you. It's beautiful.

05:33.158 --> 05:35.526
Mm.

05:35.557 --> 05:38.022
Do you girls know how a pearl is formed?

05:38.053 --> 05:41.253
A parasite gets in, right?

05:41.285 --> 05:43.014
That's right, smart girl.

05:44.229 --> 05:48.325
Yes, the parasite
creeps into the oyster,

05:48.357 --> 05:50.245
and then the oyster responds

05:50.277 --> 05:52.518
by covering that
old, invasive little thing

05:52.548 --> 05:54.693
with this substance called nacre.

05:55.547 --> 05:58.053
And eventually, it turns

05:58.084 --> 06:01.253
what was painful and out of place

06:01.285 --> 06:03.046
into something beautiful.

06:03.077 --> 06:04.998
There is no mistake

06:05.029 --> 06:06.949
that the Bible likens
the kingdom of Heaven

06:06.980 --> 06:11.462
to a pearl of great price.

06:11.493 --> 06:14.469
And you're perfect pearls.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.557
Both of you.

06:16.773 --> 06:17.798
Thank you.

06:17.829 --> 06:19.206
Thank you.

06:19.238 --> 06:20.294
They're beautiful.

06:20.324 --> 06:23.012
Oh.

06:23.044 --> 06:25.061
Um, I gotta go.

06:26.340 --> 06:27.749
Mm, I love you.

06:34.117 --> 06:36.037
Is something off with the two of you?

06:38.852 --> 06:40.678
No, not too much.

06:40.710 --> 06:45.189
I just... I don't love her boyfriend.

06:45.220 --> 06:46.629
I know.

06:46.660 --> 06:49.157
Anybody who beeps like
that and doesn't come in

06:49.189 --> 06:50.918
can't have much to recommend him.

06:50.948 --> 06:52.005
Can he?

06:52.037 --> 06:53.797
Oh, I don't so, but...

06:55.110 --> 06:57.862
You can't tell a person anything.

06:57.893 --> 07:00.708
A heart wants what it wants,

07:00.741 --> 07:02.854
and it does not care.

07:02.885 --> 07:04.616
Selena Gomez?

07:05.700 --> 07:08.388
Emily Dickinson.

07:08.421 --> 07:10.277
Right.

07:13.253 --> 07:15.941
She'll figure it out. Give her time.

07:21.508 --> 07:23.526
And I want those flowers to get there

07:23.558 --> 07:25.669
bright and early tomorrow morning

07:25.700 --> 07:28.261
so that Charity knows that
we're thinking about her.

07:28.293 --> 07:30.469
Family should always be in support

07:30.500 --> 07:32.069
of those landmark moments.

07:32.102 --> 07:33.222
- Mm-hmm.
- Ooh!

07:33.252 --> 07:35.461
That's a good tweet. Hashtag...

07:35.493 --> 07:37.893
- Family first.
- I love it.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.750
- Yes. Okay.
- Yeah. Will you do that for me?

07:39.781 --> 07:41.189
Okay.

07:41.220 --> 07:43.109
Hello?

07:43.140 --> 07:44.901
I heard you're looking for me.

07:46.588 --> 07:47.733
It's Mavis.

07:49.572 --> 07:51.653
Well, I know.

07:51.684 --> 07:54.372
- I'm just surprised.
- So, what's up?

07:54.404 --> 07:57.221
<i>Well, I was going
through Mac's belongings,</i>

07:57.253 --> 08:00.102
looking for Mama's pearls
to give to the girls.

08:00.132 --> 08:01.178
Yeah?

08:01.203 --> 08:03.142
Well, I hope that's okay
with you that I did that.

08:03.174 --> 08:05.965
<i>- I separated the strands.</i>
- I don't care.

08:07.109 --> 08:09.556
The cotillion's tonight, by the way.

08:10.565 --> 08:12.684
What is this about my club?

08:13.861 --> 08:17.253
Well, Mavis, I don't pretend
to understand these things,

08:17.284 --> 08:19.441
and as you know...

08:20.005 --> 08:21.893
we don't have a lawyer since...

08:22.982 --> 08:24.403
since Mac.

08:24.436 --> 08:26.907
Mae, what is it about my club?

08:29.093 --> 08:31.578
I think you still own it.

08:45.820 --> 08:47.069
Mr. Kevin is here.

08:55.123 --> 08:57.468
What are you doing here?

08:57.500 --> 08:59.837
Looking for Charity.

08:59.869 --> 09:02.141
- She's out of town.
- Doing what?

09:02.173 --> 09:05.148
- She's touring, singing.
- And she took Nathan with her?

09:05.180 --> 09:07.645
Yes. She made arrangements for his care.

09:07.677 --> 09:09.117
She was very responsible.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.750
Now, Kevin, why are you here?

09:10.781 --> 09:12.477
I came to apologize.

09:12.508 --> 09:14.844
Oh, well, that sounds about right,

09:14.877 --> 09:16.669
given everything
that you put her through,

09:16.701 --> 09:18.333
put all of us through.

09:18.364 --> 09:19.644
I know.

09:19.676 --> 09:22.269
I'm not here to make any excuses.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.252
I was wrong to leave like that.

09:24.284 --> 09:26.780
And stay away and not respond?

09:26.813 --> 09:30.637
I know, and I'm sorry.

09:33.148 --> 09:35.709
I was having difficulty accepting

09:35.740 --> 09:37.477
who I am

09:37.917 --> 09:39.465
and what I'd done.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.277
With good reason.

09:41.309 --> 09:43.260
But I can now.

09:46.205 --> 09:48.349
I'm ready to be a father again.

09:50.493 --> 09:52.285
Where are they?

09:52.316 --> 09:54.237
You ran out of here like a little child.

09:54.269 --> 09:56.861
You don't get to march back
in here and make demands.

09:56.893 --> 09:58.750
So, I will let her know,

09:58.780 --> 10:02.206
and I'm sure she will contact
you when she's ready.

10:05.596 --> 10:08.028
He's my son,

10:08.508 --> 10:09.886
and I have rights.

10:12.476 --> 10:15.421
Well, I would love to see
you fight for them in court

10:15.452 --> 10:17.597
so that everything could be brought out

10:17.628 --> 10:21.116
about what you did to create this mess.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.613
But he's still <i> my</i> son.

10:31.452 --> 10:33.408
All right, Kevin.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.957
I will share with Charity that we spoke.

10:38.908 --> 10:42.813
Oh, and, uh, Maricel will let you out.

10:45.788 --> 10:48.637
Maricel, have them bring
Kevin's car around, please.

11:01.789 --> 11:02.910
<i> How'd it go?</i>

11:02.940 --> 11:04.253
Just like I thought it would.

11:04.285 --> 11:06.013
<i>You know I'm here for you, Kevin.</i>

11:06.045 --> 11:07.567
Yeah.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.500
I'm gonna need your help.

11:21.565 --> 11:23.133
All right, very nice.

11:23.164 --> 11:24.509
Next Greenleaf group.

11:24.540 --> 11:25.949
- Oh.
- Okay.

11:29.053 --> 11:31.518
For posterity. Wonderful!

11:31.548 --> 11:33.917
- Absolutely.
- Darius.

11:33.948 --> 11:36.413
Come on.

11:39.964 --> 11:41.500
Perfect.

11:45.340 --> 11:47.612
- You look great, babe.
- Thanks.

11:47.645 --> 11:49.180
Kind of fun, huh?

11:49.212 --> 11:52.212
Yeah, nice, clean family fun.

11:53.021 --> 11:55.580
Hey, but I got a limo for us after this.

11:55.613 --> 11:57.021
Mm, that's a no-go.

11:57.052 --> 12:00.540
What? But I got a limo.

12:00.573 --> 12:03.303
Yeah, but just for me, I mean.

12:03.335 --> 12:04.367
I can't.

12:04.397 --> 12:05.477
Why?

12:05.510 --> 12:06.590
I'll tell you later.

12:09.020 --> 12:11.923
Excellent. How about
just the grandparents?

12:14.077 --> 12:15.326
All right, darling.

12:21.660 --> 12:24.508
Let me just...
let me just focus in here.

12:26.012 --> 12:28.220
You make a public spectacle of yourself

12:28.252 --> 12:31.292
moving your clothes
50 feet down the hall,

12:31.323 --> 12:33.117
smile like nothing happened?

12:34.588 --> 12:36.220
That's right.

12:36.252 --> 12:39.242
- Unbelievable.
- Isn't it?

12:39.283 --> 12:40.691
All right, there you go.

12:40.722 --> 12:42.547
Hold it right there.

12:43.826 --> 12:45.075
All right, perfect.

12:50.962 --> 12:52.914
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:52.945 --> 12:54.674
Uh, you clocking this?

12:54.706 --> 12:56.850
- What?
- Mama and Daddy.

12:56.882 --> 12:59.826
Uh, no. Why? What's going on?

12:59.857 --> 13:02.066
He moved out of their
room into your old suite.

13:02.098 --> 13:03.922
- Is this something they do?
- Nah.

13:03.953 --> 13:06.162
I mean, they've had their
little fights over the years,

13:06.193 --> 13:08.121
but he's never moved out of the room.

13:08.817 --> 13:10.982
Do you think we should do
something about it?

13:11.697 --> 13:14.225
- I don't know what is there to do.
- Jacob.

13:14.257 --> 13:16.913
I mean, look, they're fine. It'll pass.

13:16.945 --> 13:18.355
- Hey. How are you?
- Just try to enjoy the night.

13:18.387 --> 13:20.691
All right? Have some fun.

13:22.162 --> 13:24.114
- Come on, life's too short.
- What?

13:24.147 --> 13:26.354
Mae, let it go. I don't
want to talk about it anymore.

13:26.386 --> 13:28.434
You know I have sustained...

13:35.505 --> 13:38.194
Our next St.
Josephine's Society debutante

13:38.226 --> 13:40.136
is Sophia Greenleaf.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.729
This evening, Sophia is being
presented by her grandfather,

13:43.761 --> 13:45.650
Bishop James Greenleaf.

13:45.682 --> 13:48.177
Sophia's a rising senior
at Excellence Academy

13:48.209 --> 13:51.377
where she maintains
a weighted GPA of 4.5.

13:51.856 --> 13:54.354
Sophia is a member
of Calvary Fellowship,

13:54.386 --> 13:56.466
where she is active
in the music ministry

13:56.498 --> 13:59.186
and Christian Education department.

13:59.218 --> 14:01.042
She is the daughter of Ray Fisher

14:01.072 --> 14:02.866
and Grace Greenleaf.

14:05.106 --> 14:07.666
Our next St. Josephine Society debutante

14:07.697 --> 14:09.298
is Zora Greenleaf.

14:09.330 --> 14:12.401
This evening, Zora is being
presented by her father,

14:12.433 --> 14:14.674
Pastor Jacob Greenleaf.

14:14.706 --> 14:17.233
Zora is a rising senior
at Excellence Academy

14:17.266 --> 14:20.817
where she maintains a
weighted GPA average of 4.2.

14:20.849 --> 14:23.633
Zora is a member of Triumph Church

14:23.665 --> 14:27.953
where she is active in the youth
and audiovisual ministries.

14:27.986 --> 14:31.089
She is the daughter of Jacob
and Kerissa Greenleaf.

14:34.232 --> 14:36.082
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you

14:36.114 --> 14:40.321
this year's St. Josephine
Society debutantes.

15:15.764 --> 15:17.427
Aren't they all so elegant?

15:17.458 --> 15:20.371
It is quite a show, isn't it?

15:20.403 --> 15:21.395
Mm-hmm.

15:28.786 --> 15:31.305
Like a page in <i> Southern Decor.</i>

15:31.635 --> 15:35.028
First Lady, I am so sorry

15:35.059 --> 15:37.075
about all the drama
we got into over this.

15:37.107 --> 15:39.731
Drama? What drama?

15:41.266 --> 15:42.643
Under any other circumstances,

15:42.674 --> 15:44.467
I would've never reacted the way I did.

15:47.315 --> 15:49.298
Oh, I know.

15:49.331 --> 15:52.019
I'm just so glad it all worked out.

15:52.051 --> 15:54.195
It always does.

15:54.227 --> 15:55.897
Yes.

16:48.959 --> 16:51.200
It was really good that Le'Andria

16:51.231 --> 16:53.439
could step in when
Tamela had to duck out.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.680
Yeah, yeah, these things happen.

16:55.711 --> 16:57.439
You know, if you would've
told me a year ago

16:57.471 --> 16:59.936
that this would be my life,

16:59.968 --> 17:01.248
I would've told you you were crazy.

17:01.279 --> 17:02.817
I knew it'd happen all along.

17:04.256 --> 17:06.111
- You did?
- Oh, yeah.

17:06.142 --> 17:08.480
Some people got it
and some people don't.

17:08.511 --> 17:10.528
And the ones that got it aren't
better than the ones that don't,

17:10.559 --> 17:13.343
but they've got it.

17:13.376 --> 17:14.593
And you've got it.

17:17.343 --> 17:19.263
I think you've got it, too.

17:36.959 --> 17:39.231
I'm thinking, uh, let's get the check.

17:40.831 --> 17:42.670
Me, too.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.976
Bishop, what you over here doing
hiding all by your lonesome?

17:55.007 --> 17:56.511
You should be out there cutting tile.

17:56.544 --> 17:58.591
Well, my wife's otherwise occupied.

18:01.632 --> 18:03.584
Oh, well, why don't
you come dance with me?

18:03.616 --> 18:04.737
Come on, one song.

18:04.762 --> 18:06.304
You know, as much fun as that would be,

18:06.336 --> 18:07.936
I don't think that's a good idea.

18:07.968 --> 18:09.407
Please?

18:09.439 --> 18:12.200
I was hoping for some quality time.

18:13.855 --> 18:16.412
Well, my doors at Calvary
are always open.

18:18.176 --> 18:21.375
I'm sure you know this by now, but...

18:21.727 --> 18:25.600
I'm interested in more
of a personal connection.

18:25.631 --> 18:27.327
Have been from day one.

18:28.543 --> 18:31.168
Yes, I've... I've sensed that.

18:31.199 --> 18:32.865
I've sensed that from you, too.

18:32.895 --> 18:36.127
Yes, and I'm sure that's not inaccurate,

18:36.160 --> 18:38.656
and I'm flattered, Ms. Cross.

18:38.687 --> 18:40.255
Truly, but, um...

18:40.288 --> 18:41.437
But what?

18:43.481 --> 18:45.376
Even a man of God is still a man.

18:47.776 --> 18:48.933
Ms. Cross.

18:58.847 --> 19:02.391
Hmm. I told that brother of
mine this'll never work,

19:02.424 --> 19:04.192
but he didn't want to listen.

19:04.222 --> 19:07.897
- I told him, "Basie, that old man"...
- But you know what Basie says.

19:09.090 --> 19:11.266
"There's more than one way
to skin a Greenleaf."

19:11.291 --> 19:12.860
That's right.

19:15.951 --> 19:18.960
I don't care how we do it
as long as it hurts.

19:21.018 --> 19:23.104
As long as it hurts bad.

19:23.729 --> 19:24.895
Amen.

19:24.928 --> 19:27.136
So it's one, two, three,
one, two, three.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.695
One, two, three, one, two, three.

19:29.727 --> 19:32.512
I'm gonna go get another drink.

19:36.928 --> 19:39.016
- Baby?
- Yeah?

19:39.047 --> 19:40.735
We should go ahead
and let her go out tonight.

19:40.767 --> 19:43.039
No, we talked about that.

19:43.604 --> 19:45.172
Come on, look at her.

19:45.401 --> 19:46.906
Look at how much fun she's having.

19:48.728 --> 19:50.808
We can ground her tomorrow, you know.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.497
Even tack on a week or two, whatever.

19:53.529 --> 19:55.577
But she's having such a good time.

19:55.609 --> 19:57.625
This is such a special night.

20:00.088 --> 20:02.329
I found a condom in her room.

20:05.112 --> 20:07.353
They're having sex.

20:10.712 --> 20:12.057
My mom knows we're having sex.

20:12.089 --> 20:13.849
She doesn't want me seeing you.

20:13.881 --> 20:15.156
What?

20:16.697 --> 20:18.265
You told her, Zora?

20:18.297 --> 20:20.216
No, she found the condoms in my room.

20:20.248 --> 20:21.753
Why didn't you hide them?

20:21.861 --> 20:24.218
I did. She went through
my stuff, Isaiah.

20:24.248 --> 20:26.105
Then why didn't you lie?

20:26.137 --> 20:28.089
And say what, exactly?

20:28.120 --> 20:30.329
I'm holding them for a friend?

20:30.360 --> 20:31.865
Why do you look like that?

20:32.298 --> 20:34.649
I'm the one in trouble, not you.

20:34.682 --> 20:36.474
So, what?

20:36.505 --> 20:39.609
So, how are we ever supposed
to spend time with each other?

20:39.640 --> 20:41.388
I'm just supposed to hold your hand now?

20:41.420 --> 20:43.040
- Would that be so bad?
- Yeah.

20:43.897 --> 20:46.297
No, but... some.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.259
Man, it's like we 12 years old.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.572
Sorry.

20:52.602 --> 20:53.903
You should be.

20:55.227 --> 20:57.147
Stop making a scene.

20:57.178 --> 20:59.132
One, two, three, one, two, three.

21:15.834 --> 21:18.715
- Why you always bugging?
- I'm not. I just don't...

21:25.978 --> 21:27.233
What's the matter?

21:28.027 --> 21:29.852
- Sophia?
- I'll be right back.

21:39.867 --> 21:42.043
Isaiah, come back inside.

21:42.075 --> 21:44.195
- I'm out.
- Why are you mad at me?

21:44.220 --> 21:45.821
You could've had the
condoms at your house,

21:45.852 --> 21:47.451
but you didn't. I'm in trouble.

21:47.484 --> 21:49.628
- You blaming me?
- Isaiah, come on.

21:49.660 --> 21:51.868
You really blaming me?

21:51.900 --> 21:54.428
- I'm through. I'm through with you.
- Get off of me, Isaiah!

22:01.275 --> 22:02.766
Baby, baby, I'm sorry.

22:02.791 --> 22:04.283
- Isaiah, please stop.
- Baby, baby, I'm sorry.

22:04.315 --> 22:06.107
- Please, Isaiah.
- I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

22:06.140 --> 22:07.931
I promise you.
I won't do it again, babe.

22:07.964 --> 22:09.980
Babe, I'm sorry. We'll go back inside.

22:10.011 --> 22:12.797
Babe, I'm sorry. Babe!

22:19.099 --> 22:20.411
Sophia. Sophia, what's the matter?

22:22.075 --> 22:23.868
Uncle Jacob?

22:23.900 --> 22:25.339
Yeah, sweetie, what's up?

22:25.370 --> 22:27.483
I just saw Isaiah hit Zora.

22:27.515 --> 22:28.796
He did what?

22:28.827 --> 22:30.267
Isaiah hit Zora?

22:30.300 --> 22:32.027
- Huh?
- Oh, my word.

22:32.060 --> 22:33.586
Where is she?

22:34.875 --> 22:36.700
- Where are they?
- They're right there, right there.

22:36.731 --> 22:38.395
Zora.

22:38.427 --> 22:39.515
Yeah?

22:39.548 --> 22:40.923
- Baby.
- Yes?

22:40.955 --> 22:42.523
- What? You okay?
- What are you talking about?

22:42.556 --> 22:43.612
- I'm fine.
- Did Isaiah hit you?

22:43.644 --> 22:45.532
- Wait, what?
- Are these bru...

22:45.563 --> 22:47.323
- No, I got hit by a door.
- Are these bruises on your arm?

22:47.355 --> 22:49.403
- I got hit by a door.
- Sophia just told us Isaiah hit you.

22:49.435 --> 22:51.131
- You what?!
- Zora, please.

22:51.163 --> 22:53.373
- Hey, answer me.
- He did not hit me. Please.

22:53.403 --> 22:54.747
- What are these bruises?
- Hey, little boy,

22:54.779 --> 22:55.996
did you put your hands on my daughter?

22:56.028 --> 22:57.147
Man, I don't know
what you talking about.

22:57.180 --> 22:58.748
Daddy, please stop. Listen to me.

22:58.779 --> 23:00.475
- Did he hit you?
- He did not touch me, no!

23:00.508 --> 23:02.332
- Did he hit you?
- No! Isaiah.

23:02.364 --> 23:05.212
Yo, I didn't do nothing, bruh.

23:05.243 --> 23:06.651
- Jacob!
- Why would you do that?

23:08.284 --> 23:09.595
How could you? I said I was fine!

23:09.627 --> 23:12.028
- Zora.
- Don't follow me.

23:13.180 --> 23:14.971
Zora?

23:18.715 --> 23:20.060
No, Jacob.

23:20.090 --> 23:22.043
Better be happy I didn't kill you, boy.

23:24.412 --> 23:25.628
Well, thank God you were there.

23:25.659 --> 23:27.899
- Yeah, no problem.
- Jeez.

23:27.932 --> 23:29.724
- I'll call you when I get home?
- Yeah.

23:29.755 --> 23:31.068
You sure you guys are gonna be okay?

23:31.099 --> 23:32.475
Yeah, we'll be fine.

23:32.508 --> 23:35.035
I just wanna make sure
that Zora's all right,

23:35.067 --> 23:36.475
talk to Sophia about what happened.

23:36.507 --> 23:37.916
All right, well, I'll be up late.

23:37.948 --> 23:39.228
Okay, I'll call.

23:39.259 --> 23:40.699
- Good night, sweetie.
- Yeah.

23:40.732 --> 23:41.949
All right.

23:44.892 --> 23:46.619
- You expect me to not do anything?
- Are you kidding me?

23:46.652 --> 23:48.028
Shh.

23:52.731 --> 23:55.387
And on top of whatever else
the girl's been suffering,

23:55.419 --> 23:57.019
her own father adds to the problem.

23:57.051 --> 23:58.331
- Mae.
- What?

23:58.364 --> 24:00.803
- Jacob had his reasons.
- But he hit a child.

24:00.835 --> 24:02.108
There's got to be a way
to deal with things...

24:02.139 --> 24:03.259
- Oh, try to relax!
- ...and not make them worse.

24:03.290 --> 24:06.171
Zora, open this door.

24:07.803 --> 24:09.469
Zora.

24:09.499 --> 24:11.388
Zora, just come on out, honey.

24:11.420 --> 24:13.660
We can go home and talk
and it'll all be fine, baby.

24:13.692 --> 24:15.547
Go away!

24:15.580 --> 24:19.132
Dr. Butler, I'm extremely sorry.

24:19.163 --> 24:21.467
Thank you for saying that.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.112
Son.

24:23.643 --> 24:27.300
- This is just so upsetting.
- Come with me, Mae.

24:27.333 --> 24:28.549
Let's get something to
settle those nerves.

24:28.574 --> 24:29.630
Oh, no, no, thank you.

24:29.661 --> 24:31.036
Until that child comes out the bathroom,

24:31.067 --> 24:33.851
I don't know... I just can't
even get my mind straight.

24:33.884 --> 24:35.975
- I just don't know.
- Okay.

24:36.041 --> 24:36.969
Okay.

24:39.983 --> 24:41.327
Can I try, Aunt Kerissa?

24:41.358 --> 24:43.598
Sure, honey.

24:47.502 --> 24:50.510
Z, it's me.

24:50.543 --> 24:54.415
Sophia, you are the last
person I wanna see right now.

24:54.446 --> 24:57.615
Everybody just leave me alone, please!

24:57.645 --> 25:00.910
Okay, look, Pop, I already
know what you're gonna say.

25:00.943 --> 25:02.128
No, you don't.

25:04.943 --> 25:06.895
I'd have done the same thing.

25:12.847 --> 25:14.895
Zora, honey, it's Auntie G.

25:15.785 --> 25:17.226
Can I come in, baby?

25:23.124 --> 25:24.244
You don't have to come out.

25:24.269 --> 25:26.030
Just let me come in, okay, honey?

25:29.862 --> 25:32.423
Aunt Gigi, please just leave me alone.

25:32.454 --> 25:33.511
Please.

25:38.536 --> 25:40.008
Hey.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.255
Are you okay?

25:41.690 --> 25:43.848
<i> I'll never do it again.</i>

25:45.030 --> 25:46.946
That's what you always say.

25:47.655 --> 25:49.511
<i>I don't know what it is, baby.</i>

25:49.543 --> 25:52.936
<i>It's just something about you
that makes me so crazy.</i>

25:52.967 --> 25:55.239
<i>I never felt this way before.</i>

25:55.272 --> 25:56.840
<i>Ever.</i>

25:56.870 --> 25:58.760
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

25:58.790 --> 26:00.487
<i>Come away with me.</i>

26:00.520 --> 26:02.247
I don't know.

26:03.399 --> 26:04.872
<i>I love you.</i>

26:07.879 --> 26:09.127
<i>Zora?</i>

26:10.694 --> 26:11.880
I gotta go.

26:21.124 --> 26:23.556
Oh, I'm so glad we left
Winkie at my mother's.

26:23.589 --> 26:25.030
Oh, yeah.

26:28.517 --> 26:29.764
- Honey.
- Baby.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.526
You okay?

26:33.670 --> 26:36.326
- I wanna go home.
- Okay, come on, honey.

26:38.565 --> 26:39.910
Okay.

26:43.781 --> 26:46.277
- What a night.
- Mm.

26:46.309 --> 26:47.877
I'm going home to change.

26:47.909 --> 26:50.190
You should get a ride
with Grace and Sophia.

26:50.677 --> 26:52.630
- Where are you going?
- To see my sister.

26:52.662 --> 26:55.319
- Auntie's in town?
- Just for the night.

27:05.174 --> 27:06.742
Wow.

27:07.991 --> 27:09.782
What?

27:12.566 --> 27:13.719
Come here.

27:27.221 --> 27:28.922
You look beautiful.

27:36.342 --> 27:38.487
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

27:39.767 --> 27:41.559
It's not you.

27:41.590 --> 27:43.222
Then what's the matter?

27:45.431 --> 27:48.152
I haven't been with anybody
like this since Kevin.

27:49.719 --> 27:53.719
And I'm not a random sex
kind of girl, so.

27:53.749 --> 27:56.630
I never thought you were.
And this isn't random.

27:58.981 --> 28:01.477
I've been thinking about
this for a long time now.

28:01.955 --> 28:03.765
Me, too, I guess.

28:10.038 --> 28:11.990
What am I doing?

28:12.023 --> 28:15.511
- If you don't wanna do this, we don't...
- No, no, I...

28:16.303 --> 28:19.473
- I want to.
- Yeah, but what?

28:22.726 --> 28:25.303
I've only been with Kevin.

28:25.740 --> 28:26.957
That's okay.

28:26.988 --> 28:28.749
We can take it slow.

28:41.421 --> 28:43.021
What's the matter now?

28:44.718 --> 28:46.222
I have a scar.

28:48.109 --> 28:50.062
When they were inducing Nathan,

28:50.093 --> 28:54.479
there were complications and
they did an emergency C-section,

28:54.504 --> 28:57.161
so I have a scar.

28:59.353 --> 29:00.378
Let me see.

29:03.514 --> 29:05.211
Come on.

29:05.242 --> 29:06.682
Let me see.

29:30.074 --> 29:31.753
Charity,

29:32.730 --> 29:33.978
you're beautiful.

30:18.874 --> 30:21.114
- You moving?
- Yep.

30:21.145 --> 30:24.346
Got an offer from an investor.

30:24.378 --> 30:26.459
Wants me to open a club in Stockholm.

30:26.490 --> 30:28.852
- Sweden?!
- Yep.

30:29.434 --> 30:32.058
White folks love their blues.

30:35.898 --> 30:38.522
So, where is it?
Where's this thing you got?

30:38.554 --> 30:41.347
- That's it?
- That's why you came here, isn't it?

30:41.380 --> 30:43.239
Don't you even wanna talk?

30:43.270 --> 30:45.657
- What is there to talk about, Mae?
- Mac!

30:47.500 --> 30:49.293
I ain't got nothing to say about Mac.

30:49.325 --> 30:53.293
Oh, Mavis, come on, now.
He was our brother!

30:53.619 --> 30:55.380
So, where is the magic thing?
Where is it?

31:17.933 --> 31:19.342
So, what you think?

31:21.720 --> 31:23.160
I think I'm tired of fighting

31:23.193 --> 31:25.561
for what's already rightfully mine.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.353
I don't need the headaches.

31:27.384 --> 31:28.985
But if you could get the club back...

31:29.016 --> 31:31.064
I don't want the club back.

31:31.097 --> 31:32.760
Didn't you just hear me say I'm going?

31:32.793 --> 31:34.841
And anyway, what's it to you?

31:38.040 --> 31:40.568
Daddy is dead, Mavis.

31:40.601 --> 31:42.329
Mac is dead.

31:42.360 --> 31:44.505
- Good riddance.
- Seriously?

31:44.536 --> 31:47.306
What you standing there for,
looking at me like that?

31:47.735 --> 31:49.656
I mean, really, Mae, what do you want?

31:49.688 --> 31:51.544
You got everything.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.848
You got your big house on the hill

31:53.881 --> 31:56.057
and you got your... you got your family,

31:56.088 --> 31:57.880
you got... you got your things.

31:57.913 --> 32:00.312
You... you got everything you wanted.

32:00.345 --> 32:02.112
I want my sister back.

32:03.161 --> 32:05.912
- Well, you can't have me.
- Why?

32:06.783 --> 32:09.252
You asking me why?

32:09.283 --> 32:10.744
You know why.

32:11.295 --> 32:12.671
Sister?

32:13.817 --> 32:16.280
You don't even know
what that word means.

32:16.704 --> 32:18.529
Well, I wanna learn.

32:19.834 --> 32:21.306
Too late for that.

32:21.337 --> 32:23.737
It's not too late. It's never too late.

32:23.770 --> 32:25.433
We have time, Mavis.

32:25.465 --> 32:27.226
- We have time.
- Give this to Gigi.

32:27.258 --> 32:29.913
Let her have it. Let her do whatever
she want to with that club.

32:29.945 --> 32:32.057
I don't care. Save the world,
whatever she wanna do.

32:32.089 --> 32:33.627
Here.

32:35.140 --> 32:36.197
I'm sorry.

32:39.161 --> 32:40.985
Did you hear what I just said?

32:41.016 --> 32:44.279
I said I'm sorry.

32:45.562 --> 32:48.312
Look, we're all victims! All of us!

32:48.345 --> 32:51.258
I mean, even...
even Mac in his own way...

32:51.289 --> 32:53.434
- Take it and give it to Gigi...
- No.

32:53.465 --> 32:55.961
...or I'm gonna tear
the whole damn thing up!

32:55.993 --> 32:57.658
Now take it!

33:04.441 --> 33:07.787
And for what it's worth...
and it may not be much...

33:07.819 --> 33:09.291
I forgive you.

33:11.723 --> 33:13.451
You forgive me?

33:13.483 --> 33:16.107
- You forgive me for what?
- Don't make me say it.

33:16.140 --> 33:18.219
No, I wanna hear you say it.

33:18.250 --> 33:20.811
'Cause you forgive me for what?

33:21.035 --> 33:22.348
James.

33:28.076 --> 33:31.403
Yes, for getting back at me

33:31.435 --> 33:35.180
with him that one time.

33:35.211 --> 33:38.316
Yes, for getting back at me
with him that one time.

33:38.347 --> 33:41.291
For that, Lord, I forgive you.

33:41.323 --> 33:43.819
One time?

33:43.851 --> 33:45.227
Is that what he told you?

33:45.260 --> 33:48.524
One time? Really?

33:48.556 --> 33:53.611
Mae, I... I can't even count the times

33:53.643 --> 33:56.555
I threw your husband out of here.

33:56.588 --> 33:58.124
You stop that right now.

33:58.854 --> 34:00.075
Or not.

34:00.108 --> 34:01.610
Do you hear me? You stop it!

34:04.055 --> 34:06.807
Is there any lie you won't
suck onto like a leech...

34:07.692 --> 34:09.900
just to keep from tasting the truth,

34:09.931 --> 34:11.532
the tip of your tongue?

34:13.552 --> 34:16.400
- He never loved you.
- That is not true.

34:16.431 --> 34:18.382
He thought you were pretty.

34:18.415 --> 34:21.327
Oh, he knew for sure you was pretty.

34:21.359 --> 34:23.386
You was a pretty, little
light-skinned thing.

34:23.418 --> 34:24.485
You better quit.

34:24.510 --> 34:28.367
No, he wanted you 'cause
you were so pretty.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.280
It was all to make him look good

34:31.311 --> 34:34.063
and to help the business... the church.

34:36.283 --> 34:37.690
But that's all it was.

34:37.722 --> 34:39.728
That's all it's ever been.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.681
And that's all it'll ever be,

34:43.398 --> 34:45.178
about the business.

34:46.938 --> 34:48.443
Sister.

34:53.889 --> 34:55.170
You can see yourself out.

34:57.299 --> 35:00.116
I think what he chose is a wife.

35:01.285 --> 35:02.758
So what does that make you?

35:47.877 --> 35:49.638
So, how do you wanna handle this?

35:51.418 --> 35:53.339
I'm gonna go talk to her.

35:53.371 --> 35:54.491
Okay.

35:56.603 --> 35:58.458
What are you gonna say?

35:58.489 --> 36:03.098
Uh, um, just what I did was wrong.

36:03.130 --> 36:05.785
You know, I shouldn't have
put my hands on the boy.

36:05.818 --> 36:08.507
I don't know, just...

36:09.225 --> 36:10.473
just that I love her.

36:13.160 --> 36:14.920
What did we do wrong, Jacob?

36:14.951 --> 36:16.680
Wrong? We didn't do anything wrong.

36:16.711 --> 36:19.176
It's just that ever since
that child was born,

36:19.207 --> 36:23.015
I've done everything I can to make
her feel how valuable she is,

36:23.048 --> 36:25.320
how precious.

36:25.351 --> 36:29.160
Tried to prepare her for a world
that might try and beat her down,

36:29.646 --> 36:32.078
and then she goes off
and lets herself be hit?

36:32.110 --> 36:34.478
Faith was the same way.

36:34.510 --> 36:35.918
That guy she was seeing
when she left home

36:35.949 --> 36:37.294
treated her something awful.

36:38.405 --> 36:40.142
We can't control everything.

36:40.174 --> 36:43.501
- You can't.
- I know.

36:43.533 --> 36:46.893
But there is obviously
something inside of her

36:46.926 --> 36:49.999
that is broken or unfinished

36:50.525 --> 36:53.774
that feels like she deserves that.

36:54.404 --> 36:56.431
And I'm thinking about her
taking that pain

36:56.462 --> 36:59.367
because of something
that she feels she deserves.

37:01.742 --> 37:02.958
It breaks my heart.

37:02.990 --> 37:04.495
Look...

37:06.191 --> 37:08.655
we've got her for one
more year in this house.

37:09.902 --> 37:13.006
Love can do a lot in a year.

37:14.543 --> 37:16.655
It's gonna be okay.

37:16.686 --> 37:19.054
All right?

37:25.845 --> 37:28.146
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

37:30.165 --> 37:31.312
I'll be right back.

37:33.205 --> 37:34.901
Hey, Zora?

37:38.075 --> 37:39.515
Zora?

37:44.117 --> 37:45.877
Zora, sweetheart, you awake?

37:48.320 --> 37:50.304
Zora?

37:59.267 --> 38:00.707
Zora?

38:06.617 --> 38:08.089
- Kerissa?!
- Yeah?

38:12.472 --> 38:14.457
- Baby? Kerissa?
- Yeah, what's wrong?

38:14.489 --> 38:16.185
- Kerissa?
- What's wrong?

38:16.216 --> 38:19.128
- Baby, she's not here.
- What?

38:19.161 --> 38:21.657
What do you mean she's not here?

38:22.217 --> 38:23.722
Zora!

38:23.753 --> 38:25.034
Zora?

38:28.425 --> 38:30.569
- She's not in there?
- Zora?

38:30.600 --> 38:32.744
Zora?

38:33.377 --> 38:34.690
Zora?

38:38.912 --> 38:40.608
- Hi, Daddy.
- Good morning.

38:40.641 --> 38:43.426
Morning. You all right?

38:43.457 --> 38:45.181
What's the mat...

38:46.908 --> 38:47.932
Mama?

38:47.964 --> 38:49.437
You've been out all night?

38:52.360 --> 38:54.100
I want you out of this house.

38:55.751 --> 38:57.735
- Whoa, what?
- Can we talk about this upstairs?

38:57.768 --> 39:00.159
- There's nothing to talk about.
- Mae.

39:00.726 --> 39:05.480
You told me it only happened one time.

39:18.472 --> 39:19.880
So be it.

39:28.239 --> 39:29.392
Oh, Mama.

39:30.719 --> 39:32.272
Could you make me
some breakfast, please?

39:32.304 --> 39:33.775
I'll have it in the sun room.

39:33.807 --> 39:35.568
I've been driving all night.
I'm starving.

39:42.447 --> 39:44.848
- Hello?
<i>- Gigi, Zora's gone.</i>

39:44.879 --> 39:47.119
<i>And Isaiah's parents
says he's gone, too.</i>

39:47.152 --> 39:50.192
<i>We have no idea where they went
or even if they're all right.</i>

39:50.217 --> 39:51.081
<i>Nothing.</i>

40:24.396 --> 40:25.869
Bishop.

40:28.416 --> 40:29.761
Come on in.
