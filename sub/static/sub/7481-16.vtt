00:15.857 --> 00:18.359
It's not a rental,
it's for sale.

00:24.016 --> 00:26.617
Hello.

00:33.458 --> 00:34.625
I think
I have them.

00:34.627 --> 00:37.478
Yeah, looks like
I have three left.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.830
Sure, what's
your name?

00:41.383 --> 00:43.384
Okay.

00:43.386 --> 00:44.418
Great.

00:44.420 --> 00:46.670
Yeah, I will be here
the rest of the day.

00:46.672 --> 00:47.888
Thanks.

00:47.890 --> 00:49.923
Hey!

00:54.229 --> 00:56.213
Stop. Stop.

00:58.149 --> 00:59.669
Get out of the way,
get out of the way.

Oh, my gosh, you totally
didn't have to do that.

01:49.235 --> 01:50.400
Nonsense, are you kidding?

01:50.402 --> 01:51.401
It was my pleasure.

01:51.403 --> 01:52.386
It's gonna be great.

01:52.388 --> 01:53.554
Hey, how are you, Sam?

01:53.556 --> 01:54.988
Is there a celebration
I should know about?

01:54.990 --> 01:56.190
Deeks just bought us two tickets

01:56.192 --> 01:58.275
to board the high-speed rail
to financial freedom,

01:58.277 --> 01:59.276
thank you very much.

01:59.278 --> 02:00.828
I'm afraid to ask.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.045
Kensi and I will
be attending the

02:02.047 --> 02:04.381
Timmy Robertson Train
to Financial Freedom

02:04.383 --> 02:05.799
seminar this Friday.

02:05.801 --> 02:08.285
Fiscal independence
will soon be ours.

02:08.287 --> 02:09.586
It's gonna be...
it's gonna awesome.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.588
It's going to be insane.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.640
Insanely boring.

02:13.642 --> 02:15.292
Please help me
get out of this.

02:15.294 --> 02:16.477
You don't want to go?

02:16.479 --> 02:18.812
I would rather go back
in the field with Granger.

02:18.814 --> 02:20.130
Then why are you going?

02:20.132 --> 02:22.816
Because I needed a partner
for a last-minute sniper class,

02:22.818 --> 02:24.134
and Deeks did me a solid.

02:24.136 --> 02:25.135
I don't get it.

02:25.137 --> 02:26.820
He's so excited
about this seminar.

02:26.822 --> 02:28.939
Then why
don't you just tell him?

02:28.941 --> 02:30.858
Because I would rather go to
the seminar than listen to him

02:30.860 --> 02:33.577
go on about how I bailed on him.

02:33.579 --> 02:34.778
Who's ready for it?

02:34.780 --> 02:35.946
Who is ready to be
the master

02:35.948 --> 02:36.980
of their financial destiny?

02:36.982 --> 02:38.248
I want to see a show of hands.

02:38.250 --> 02:40.117
Ha, all right.

02:40.119 --> 02:41.535
In fact, I am so excited

02:41.537 --> 02:43.987
that I am going to go
to the ladies' room.

02:43.989 --> 02:44.955
That's excited.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.990
She's real excited.

02:46.992 --> 02:47.958
Kill me.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.826
Now.
Please.

02:49.828 --> 02:52.162
Wait, you
don't want to go?

02:52.164 --> 02:54.331
I would rather...
take another bullet

02:54.333 --> 02:55.766
than go to one
of these things.

02:56.886 --> 02:58.468
Then why are you going?

02:58.470 --> 03:00.053
Because I got it
from a very reliable source

03:00.055 --> 03:01.471
she got her heart set on this.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.857
And she took care of Monty
last week so I owe her.

03:03.859 --> 03:06.176
I want to pay her back before
I, you know, owe her for...

03:06.178 --> 03:07.611
ever.

03:07.613 --> 03:09.096
Hey.
Hey.

03:09.098 --> 03:10.647
Hey.

03:12.387 --> 03:14.822
This is going
to be awesome.

03:14.824 --> 03:16.824
Awesome.
Awesome.

03:17.860 --> 03:18.943
Where's Callen?

03:18.945 --> 03:21.362
Oh, he had a overnight
stakeout at Pendleton.

03:21.364 --> 03:22.580
He's on his way.

03:23.415 --> 03:24.448
All right.

03:27.954 --> 03:29.587
Oh, man.

03:29.589 --> 03:30.570
Wow.

03:30.572 --> 03:31.538
Sam Hanna.

03:31.540 --> 03:32.756
Sam, it's Yusef.

03:32.758 --> 03:33.757
Hey, Yusef,
how are...?

03:33.759 --> 03:35.042
I need your help...

03:38.681 --> 03:39.713
When?

03:39.715 --> 03:40.714
Today...

03:46.521 --> 03:49.256
Yusef, keep
your phone on.

03:49.258 --> 03:50.357
Okay...

03:50.359 --> 03:52.309
But I'm gonna do my best
to try to find him.

03:52.311 --> 03:55.595
Everything
all right?

03:55.597 --> 03:57.448
No.

04:03.371 --> 04:06.440
He lines up, he appears focused.

04:06.442 --> 04:08.242
He sets,

04:08.244 --> 04:10.744
plants...

04:10.746 --> 04:12.746
and he's off.

04:15.418 --> 04:16.884
He's done it, folks,

04:16.886 --> 04:18.385
breaking his
previous record.

04:18.387 --> 04:20.137
There's a record?

04:20.139 --> 04:21.305
There's always
a record.

04:21.307 --> 04:22.840
And the crowd goes wi...

04:23.843 --> 04:25.843
Thank you,
thank you.

04:25.845 --> 04:27.127
Guys,

04:27.129 --> 04:29.596
sorry to interrupt
the fun.

04:29.598 --> 04:30.648
There's been
an accident.

04:30.650 --> 04:32.599
Hollywood,
west of Cahuenga.

04:32.601 --> 04:33.734
I need any
and all surveillance.

04:33.736 --> 04:34.985
Want me to, uh,
whistle up the others?

04:34.987 --> 04:36.070
No, no.

04:36.072 --> 04:37.237
This is personal.

04:39.824 --> 04:43.661
I am terrified to even repeat
what Hetty said she'd do to me

04:43.663 --> 04:46.113
if I ever helped you
off the record again.

04:46.115 --> 04:48.648
Eric, given I know
the repercussions,

04:48.650 --> 04:51.151
in order for me to ask,
it must be an emergency.

04:51.953 --> 04:54.004
You only live
once, right?

04:54.006 --> 04:56.924
Yeah, I think I already
cashed that chip in.

04:56.926 --> 04:58.926
It must be
important to you.

04:58.928 --> 05:00.344
You have no idea.

05:00.346 --> 05:02.162
Who's important?

05:02.164 --> 05:03.663
We got something going down?

05:03.665 --> 05:06.300
Uh, yeah, we just got a call
on the hotline.

05:06.302 --> 05:08.185
It's a high-value asset,
so we're...

05:08.187 --> 05:09.186
Nell.

05:09.188 --> 05:11.805
It's okay.

05:11.807 --> 05:13.607
It's a personal matter.

05:13.609 --> 05:15.943
My personal matter.

05:17.645 --> 05:20.680
Well, I'm pretty sure Hetty has
a policy against conducting

05:20.682 --> 05:23.033
personal business
on federal time.

05:23.035 --> 05:24.818
Ask me how I know.

05:26.237 --> 05:27.654
Can I have a word with you?

05:34.245 --> 05:38.048
During a mission in Afghanistan,
I got separated from my squad.

05:38.050 --> 05:41.701
I was wounded,
hunted by the Taliban.

05:41.703 --> 05:44.171
Then this village elder
named Yusef Khan

05:44.173 --> 05:46.006
granted me what's called <i>Lokhay.</i>

05:46.008 --> 05:49.226
The vow to safeguard an
individual against his enemies

05:49.228 --> 05:50.978
and protect him at all costs.

05:50.980 --> 05:52.896
He put his,
his family's life

05:52.898 --> 05:55.015
and the safety of his village
on the line.

05:55.017 --> 05:56.016
For me.

05:56.018 --> 05:58.018
If it wasn't for
Yusef intervening,

05:58.020 --> 06:00.053
I wouldn't even be
here today.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.321
Something happened?

06:01.323 --> 06:05.325
His nephew was in an accident
and he's missing.

06:05.327 --> 06:07.077
I have to help him.

06:07.079 --> 06:08.946
I understand.

06:08.948 --> 06:10.581
But that's a job for
local law enforcement.

06:10.583 --> 06:13.500
No disrespect, sir,
I'm doing this.

06:13.502 --> 06:15.402
You do what you have to do.

06:16.671 --> 06:19.072
Just not on
the government's dime.

06:22.427 --> 06:24.428
You win.

06:24.430 --> 06:27.765
I have 219 hours
of leave accrued.

06:27.767 --> 06:29.433
Consider them taken.

06:38.759 --> 06:40.927
Hey, is there anything
we can do?

06:42.064 --> 06:43.397
Not on fed time.

06:43.399 --> 06:44.815
Ten years ago

06:44.817 --> 06:46.033
I pulled some strings

06:46.035 --> 06:48.768
to get a friend and his
nephew Amir into the U.S.

06:48.770 --> 06:50.437
Amir had an accident
and he's missing.

06:50.439 --> 06:51.771
W-- are there any leads?

06:51.773 --> 06:53.157
No, Granger's
giving me all kind

06:53.159 --> 06:54.908
of static about it
being personal,

06:54.910 --> 06:56.910
so I'm gonna take some time off
and work on it.

06:56.912 --> 06:59.913
Not without my approval,
you're not.

06:59.915 --> 07:02.049
And I'm with the
assistant director.

07:02.051 --> 07:05.285
First your
Challenger, now this.

07:05.287 --> 07:09.056
The ops center is not
your personal LoJack system.

07:09.058 --> 07:12.559
Your repetitive
disregard of policy

07:12.561 --> 07:14.061
is unsettling.

07:14.063 --> 07:16.647
I'm sorry, Hetty,
but I have a debt to repay.

07:16.649 --> 07:17.931
You guys need to see this.

07:23.971 --> 07:26.440
It's footage
of the accident.

07:26.442 --> 07:28.408
That's Amir.

07:28.410 --> 07:32.196
Okay, who randomly hits a guy
and then takes the body?

07:32.198 --> 07:34.998
A driver that wants
to avoid charges.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.450
Eric,

07:36.452 --> 07:39.253
this isn't a matter
we're currently pursuing.

07:39.255 --> 07:43.323
What if facial rec' gets
a hit on a confirmed terrorist?

07:46.878 --> 07:50.414
The passenger in
the car behind them.

07:50.416 --> 07:51.998
That is Haakim
"The Ambassador" Habib.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.301
Ambassador of what-- ill will?

07:54.303 --> 07:57.888
Habib's followers recruit
local Muslims in the U.S.

07:57.890 --> 08:00.057
and introduce them
to the Taliban way.

08:00.059 --> 08:02.059
Do you remember that
Chechen cell that we shut down?

08:02.061 --> 08:03.076
I do.

08:03.078 --> 08:04.361
Okay, Habib was rumored
to be behind it.

08:04.363 --> 08:06.346
We've been after him for years.

08:06.348 --> 08:08.515
As far as we know,

08:08.517 --> 08:12.069
Habib's never been
in the United States.

08:12.071 --> 08:13.620
So, why now?

08:13.622 --> 08:14.705
Probably something big.

08:14.707 --> 08:16.022
Let's hope he's
not shopping

08:16.024 --> 08:18.158
for a Cold War nuclear weapon.

08:20.879 --> 08:22.529
Guess it's our case now.

08:22.531 --> 08:24.715
Unless you have something
more important.

08:27.168 --> 08:28.752
Keep me posted.

08:33.390 --> 08:38.010
Find the Ambassador and you'll
find your friend's nephew.

08:38.013 --> 08:40.313
When that's done,

08:40.316 --> 08:42.881
come find me.

08:44.102 --> 08:45.769
I should've
taken some leave time.

08:45.771 --> 08:48.989
Okay, so why is
Habib in the U.S.?

08:48.991 --> 08:51.441
Given his desire to see
American infidels fall,

08:51.443 --> 08:53.893
he's probably here to recruit
a new cell personally.

08:53.895 --> 08:56.363
Well,
where does that leave Amir?

08:57.999 --> 08:59.783
I'll start with his uncle.

08:59.785 --> 09:02.252
Yusef works
at a Laundromat on Pico.

09:02.254 --> 09:03.337
Eric, see if you can track

09:03.339 --> 09:04.338
Habib's car.

09:04.340 --> 09:05.589
You two hit
the crime scene

09:05.591 --> 09:07.374
and see what you can find.
Okay.

09:07.376 --> 09:09.042
Sam.

09:09.044 --> 09:11.077
We'll get him back.

09:12.463 --> 09:14.514
Let's do it.

09:18.886 --> 09:20.470
Want to get
matching tapestries?

09:20.472 --> 09:22.322
Can I help you?

09:22.324 --> 09:24.191
Not unless you got
a hot investment strategy.

09:24.193 --> 09:25.225
I'm just kidding.

09:25.227 --> 09:27.227
You seen this guy?

09:27.229 --> 09:29.763
Yeah, he's been coming
in here for two weeks,

09:29.765 --> 09:31.315
test-driving the latest laptop.

09:31.317 --> 09:33.266
And this morning he tried
to rip me off.

09:33.268 --> 09:34.267
Tried?

09:34.269 --> 09:35.369
Well, I
chased him down.

09:35.371 --> 09:36.403
The laptop anyway.

09:36.405 --> 09:37.437
Some lunatic hit him with a car,

09:37.439 --> 09:38.822
threw him in the back,
and took off.

09:38.824 --> 09:39.790
It was crazy.

09:39.792 --> 09:40.991
Did you get a license plate?

09:40.993 --> 09:42.175
No, sorry.

09:42.177 --> 09:43.744
You got the laptop?

09:43.746 --> 09:44.828
Sure do.

09:44.830 --> 09:46.997
I'm going to write it off
on my insurance.

09:46.999 --> 09:48.298
Actually, we're gonna need
to confiscate that.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.300
And your surveillance footage,
too.

09:50.302 --> 09:52.002
Do I have a choice?

09:52.004 --> 09:54.388
Rhymes with "no."

09:54.390 --> 09:56.590
Actually, it's just no.

10:12.106 --> 10:13.357
Taking my break.

10:13.359 --> 10:15.859
Okay.

10:15.861 --> 10:17.577
As-salaam alaikum.

10:17.579 --> 10:18.978
Wa alaikum as-salaam.

10:22.417 --> 10:24.584
Thank you
for coming so quickly.

10:24.586 --> 10:25.869
Of course.

10:25.871 --> 10:28.005
We're gonna do everything
we can to find Amir.

10:29.540 --> 10:31.041
Does he have
any history of trouble?

10:37.682 --> 10:40.217
Any sudden changes
in his behavior?

10:40.219 --> 10:42.335
Amir is a
fine young man.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.688
He goes to
school, studies.

10:44.690 --> 10:46.390
He's not one for trouble.

10:46.392 --> 10:49.026
He has such a huge heart.

10:54.816 --> 10:58.402
You know this man?

11:00.738 --> 11:02.372
Get down!

11:26.881 --> 11:28.682
Eric, any news on the shooter?

11:28.684 --> 11:30.250
FBI database says

11:30.252 --> 11:34.177
he's Ali Durrani. He's a member
of the small-time radical group

11:34.180 --> 11:36.597
the National Jihadist Front.

11:36.599 --> 11:38.682
It's a sect
of the Haggani Network,

11:38.684 --> 11:39.967
allies with the Taliban.

11:39.969 --> 11:41.602
That explains
Habib's involvement.

11:41.604 --> 11:44.522
I've identified three known
associates with the group,

11:44.524 --> 11:47.208
including Ali's brother
Salim Durrani.

11:47.210 --> 11:49.860
I'm downloading it
to your smartphone now.

11:49.862 --> 11:51.695
Look, scour
the Durrani brothers' e-prints

11:51.697 --> 11:53.197
and get Kaleidoscope
on that van.

11:53.199 --> 11:55.032
I'll have Kensi and Deeks
check out

11:55.034 --> 11:56.483
Yusef and Amir's apartment.

11:56.485 --> 11:58.702
Got it.

12:04.209 --> 12:07.327
This is the work of the Taliban,
isn't it?

12:07.329 --> 12:09.663
What makes you say that?

12:13.985 --> 12:16.320
Because I saved your life.

12:18.273 --> 12:21.308
After you left our village,
the Taliban came.

12:21.310 --> 12:23.561
When they discovered
you'd escaped,

12:23.563 --> 12:26.013
they killed my family.

12:26.015 --> 12:28.449
I was able
to get Amir to safety

12:28.451 --> 12:30.517
by fleeing
to a refugee camp.

12:30.519 --> 12:33.287
That's when
we reached out to you.

12:33.289 --> 12:36.373
Why have you never told me this?

12:36.375 --> 12:39.710
It was my decision
to grant you <i>Lokhay,</i>

12:39.712 --> 12:42.746
and the burden of repercussions
are mine alone.

12:42.748 --> 12:46.800
You shouldn't have
to carry that weight.

12:46.802 --> 12:50.504
It was the right thing to do.

12:53.058 --> 12:54.758
How do you think they found you?

12:54.760 --> 12:57.978
Immigrants are making their way
into States everyday now.

12:57.980 --> 13:01.565
It's not uncommon to see someone
from a neighboring village

13:01.567 --> 13:03.601
at the local mosque.

13:10.108 --> 13:14.111
I show up late one morning,
and this is what happens?

13:14.113 --> 13:16.997
Why grab Amir if you know
where Yusef lives?

13:16.999 --> 13:19.066
Why go to all that trouble?

13:19.068 --> 13:22.036
Doesn't make a lot of sense.
If they wanted Yusef,

13:22.038 --> 13:24.254
they could've grabbed
him instead of Amir.

13:31.096 --> 13:33.080
Hide him someplace off the grid.

13:33.082 --> 13:34.715
Bad idea.

13:34.717 --> 13:36.133
You'll get resistance
from Hetty and Granger,

13:36.135 --> 13:38.218
and it won't be as easy
to keep an eye on him.

13:38.220 --> 13:40.187
I don't care.

13:41.022 --> 13:43.190
I get you want to protect him.

13:43.192 --> 13:46.026
But you're thinking
with your heart, not your head.

13:46.028 --> 13:47.695
You're right. I am.

13:47.697 --> 13:50.097
And if I move him,
I can look out for him

13:50.099 --> 13:51.949
the same way he did for me.

13:51.951 --> 13:53.651
You feel obligated.
G,

13:53.653 --> 13:56.453
he lost his entire family
because of me.

13:56.455 --> 13:58.822
This is the least I can do.

13:58.824 --> 14:01.792
He lost his entire family
over principle.

14:01.794 --> 14:03.327
The best thing
you can do

14:03.329 --> 14:04.329
is put him in the system.

14:04.330 --> 14:06.130
That way we can keep
an eye on him.

14:08.333 --> 14:10.467
Someplace

14:10.469 --> 14:12.052
like the boatshed?
Exactly.

14:12.054 --> 14:13.137
We can post a guard,
and that way

14:13.139 --> 14:14.755
we can keep working the case.

14:19.344 --> 14:21.061
Okay.

14:23.932 --> 14:26.133
They won't give up.

14:26.935 --> 14:29.136
They never do.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.920
Clear.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.957
Clear.

14:56.881 --> 14:59.266
So...

14:59.268 --> 15:02.269
why is Amir stealing a laptop

15:02.271 --> 15:04.054
when this one's still new?

15:04.056 --> 15:06.356
Maybe the one at the store
had intel on it

15:06.358 --> 15:08.642
that he didn't want
traced back to him.

15:10.729 --> 15:12.012
Since when

15:12.014 --> 15:14.347
did you become
so financially responsible?

15:14.349 --> 15:16.450
Oh, it's always been there.
You're just starting to see

15:16.452 --> 15:19.019
the diamond
underneath the rugged exterior.

15:19.854 --> 15:22.039
Why do I even bother?

15:23.792 --> 15:25.242
When are you gonna
accept the fact

15:25.244 --> 15:26.827
that we don't know
everything about each other?

15:26.829 --> 15:27.861
That's part of the fun

15:27.863 --> 15:29.696
of getting to know your partner.

15:29.698 --> 15:32.299
If you say so.
Watch.

15:32.301 --> 15:36.136
Tell me something about
you that I don't know.

15:39.424 --> 15:40.540
Come on.

15:40.542 --> 15:41.759
Spill it.

15:41.761 --> 15:43.977
Anything.

15:45.079 --> 15:47.264
Okay.

15:48.099 --> 15:50.818
Well,

15:50.820 --> 15:53.654
before I joined NCIS,

15:53.656 --> 15:56.690
I actually considered
becoming a bounty hunter.

15:56.692 --> 15:58.609
I already knew that.
Give me something else.

15:58.611 --> 16:02.162
What do you mean
you already knew that?

16:02.164 --> 16:04.364
I mean that... you...
I don't know.

16:04.366 --> 16:06.233
You must've already
told me on a...

16:06.235 --> 16:07.868
stakeout or something.
Just give me something... else.

16:07.870 --> 16:11.121
No. No, no, no.
I never told anybody that.

16:11.123 --> 16:12.840
Nobody knew that.

16:14.509 --> 16:16.710
Unless...

16:17.595 --> 16:19.463
You read my memoir?!

16:19.465 --> 16:21.414
What? Okay. You're overreacting.

16:21.416 --> 16:23.684
I wouldn't really call it
a memoir; it's more of a diary.

16:23.686 --> 16:25.385
Why did you do that?
'Cause it was sitting

16:25.387 --> 16:27.437
on your desk--
I-I thought it was evidence.

16:27.439 --> 16:29.723
What?
It didn't have a label.

16:29.725 --> 16:31.358
I just started flipping through
to see what case it was,

16:31.360 --> 16:35.028
and I couldn't stop. It was like
a really sad, handwritten novel.

16:35.030 --> 16:36.029
How much did you read?

16:36.031 --> 16:38.098
Just a couple of pages.

16:39.033 --> 16:41.268
Chapter.

16:43.071 --> 16:44.571
Chapters.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.624
Listen, you have...

16:48.493 --> 16:50.377
...surprisingly beautiful prose.

16:51.446 --> 16:54.298
Well-played. Well-played.

16:55.383 --> 16:57.801
Well, hello, Clarice.

16:57.803 --> 16:58.886
What?

17:05.560 --> 17:08.595
What's a good kid like Amir
doing with a handgun?

17:08.597 --> 17:10.396
Protection?

17:10.398 --> 17:12.766
Maybe he read somebody's diary.

17:13.601 --> 17:15.435
Memoir.

17:15.436 --> 17:16.770
I'm gonna call it in.

17:16.771 --> 17:19.638
You want to help me up
real quick? To...

17:20.491 --> 17:22.242
That's fine.
I can get up from here.

17:22.243 --> 17:26.280
I'm good. Just...
me and my broken phalange.

17:32.653 --> 17:34.504
All right.
Have him get back to me.

17:34.506 --> 17:35.989
Yusef's all set.

17:35.991 --> 17:38.425
He should be comfortable.
Yeah, I spent three months up there

17:38.427 --> 17:39.827
one time
without Hetty even knowing.

17:39.828 --> 17:41.345
She knew.

17:41.347 --> 17:43.931
It's a good thing you didn't
push it to four months.

17:44.682 --> 17:46.350
Kensi called.
Mm-hmm.

17:46.352 --> 17:48.552
Deeks found a gun
under Amir's bed.

17:49.387 --> 17:51.004
Why would he get a weapon?

17:51.006 --> 17:52.389
Protect himself?

17:52.391 --> 17:54.174
He might've known
they were coming.

17:54.176 --> 17:56.526
Wasn't protecting anyone
under a bed.

17:56.528 --> 17:58.946
Could've been uncomfortable
carrying it around.

17:58.948 --> 18:01.514
Maybe he wasn't concerned
with his own safety.

18:01.516 --> 18:03.700
Maybe he was protecting Yusef.

18:05.186 --> 18:07.204
Whoa, Nell?
Yes.

18:07.206 --> 18:10.190
I don't know if this is good
or bad, but check this out.

18:18.249 --> 18:19.750
Huh.

18:19.752 --> 18:22.035
That's Ali Durrani
dropping off Amir.

18:22.037 --> 18:24.254
Three days before the abduction.

18:24.256 --> 18:26.089
They knew each other.

18:26.091 --> 18:30.844
Looks like Amir isn't the
innocent kid Yusef thinks he is.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.408
Come in.

19:09.099 --> 19:12.351
Yusef, there's no
easy way to say this.

19:13.887 --> 19:15.170
We think Amir

19:15.172 --> 19:17.306
may be getting pulled
into a radical group.

19:17.308 --> 19:19.058
Impossible.

19:19.060 --> 19:20.977
We have footage of Amir

19:20.979 --> 19:23.312
with one of the men
who abducted him.

19:23.314 --> 19:24.814
Their actions are friendly.

19:24.816 --> 19:28.684
They knew each
other, Yusef.

19:28.686 --> 19:32.121
I've seen this before
with another friend.

19:32.939 --> 19:35.458
He's young,

19:35.460 --> 19:37.626
impressionable.

19:38.462 --> 19:40.663
Somebody got to him.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.499
Not Amir.

19:43.501 --> 19:47.086
We found a gun
under his bed, Yusef.

19:47.904 --> 19:49.889
That usually means
you're either

19:49.891 --> 19:52.391
expecting trouble
or you're already in it.

20:00.901 --> 20:03.903
Amir is a fine young man.

20:03.905 --> 20:05.821
He goes to school,

20:05.823 --> 20:09.025
he works hard.
He even has a girl.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.828
Why haven't
you mentioned that before?

20:18.585 --> 20:22.621
I'm ashamed to say,
I don't care for her.

20:22.623 --> 20:25.591
No offense,
but she's too American.

20:25.593 --> 20:29.128
Tries to get Amir
to relinquish his heritage.

20:29.980 --> 20:33.182
Amir listens to her
more than me.

20:36.386 --> 20:38.471
I'll need her address.

20:38.473 --> 20:42.691
If Amir is in trouble,
she's the reason.

20:50.283 --> 20:52.818
Really?

20:52.820 --> 20:56.322
You can't still
be upset with me.

20:56.324 --> 20:58.324
Listen, you left it
on your desk.

20:58.326 --> 21:01.210
I just took that as a sign
that you wanted me to read it.

21:01.212 --> 21:02.878
What? I'm a detective.

21:02.880 --> 21:05.131
I get paid to snoop.

21:05.133 --> 21:07.133
You know what?
Financial plan yourself.

21:07.135 --> 21:09.585
Wait.

21:09.587 --> 21:12.221
That's why you wanted
to go to the seminar?

21:12.223 --> 21:14.790
Because of what you
read in my journal.

21:14.792 --> 21:17.309
And I quote,
"One of my major regrets

21:17.311 --> 21:19.294
"is I have not done
any financial planning

21:19.296 --> 21:21.463
for me
and my future family."

21:21.465 --> 21:24.016
How do you know
that that's not fiction?

21:24.018 --> 21:25.634
Maybe I'm writing a book?

21:25.636 --> 21:28.320
You? A book?

21:28.322 --> 21:30.022
No.

21:30.024 --> 21:32.074
You're not wri... I don't mean
that you can't write...

21:32.076 --> 21:33.442
Okay, hold on!

21:33.444 --> 21:35.778
When are <i>you</i> going to accept
we don't know everything

21:35.780 --> 21:37.663
about each other?

21:37.665 --> 21:39.665
Touché.

21:39.667 --> 21:41.584
How can I make it right?

21:42.586 --> 21:44.870
I want to know
something about you

21:44.872 --> 21:46.422
that nobody else knows.

21:46.424 --> 21:49.175
That's a tall order.
I'm a pretty open book.

21:49.177 --> 21:50.735
That is a terrible
choice of words.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.145
Now.

21:52.146 --> 21:55.314
I'm thinking.
Just give me a second.

21:55.316 --> 21:57.683
Better be true.
Damn, there goes that one.

21:57.685 --> 21:58.568
Okay, you know what?
Forget about it.

21:58.593 --> 21:59.686
No, no, no, no. Wait.

21:59.687 --> 22:01.554
Hold on a second. Hold...
Just stop, stop, stop, stop.

22:01.556 --> 22:03.439
All right, all right. Fair
enough, fair enough. But this

22:03.441 --> 22:05.107
stays in the vault.
Just spill it.

22:05.109 --> 22:07.977
During college, and one time...

22:07.979 --> 22:10.012
twice... half a dozen times

22:10.014 --> 22:12.114
in law school,
I had to creatively finance

22:12.116 --> 22:15.117
my room and board situation
via the arts.

22:15.119 --> 22:16.118
Which arts?

22:16.120 --> 22:19.521
The provocative
expressionistic format.

22:20.524 --> 22:22.191
Dance.

22:23.326 --> 22:25.711
Exotic in nature.

22:27.831 --> 22:30.299
Oh... my God.

22:30.301 --> 22:31.800
Wait.

22:31.802 --> 22:33.469
You, you were a stripper?

22:33.471 --> 22:36.538
I was an exotic dancer,
and it was very liberating.

22:37.725 --> 22:39.541
And slightly humiliating.

22:39.543 --> 22:42.428
Best day ever.

22:42.430 --> 22:44.230
Yep, get it out of your system.
Laugh it up.

22:44.232 --> 22:46.649
Did you have a stage name?

22:46.651 --> 22:48.217
Really?
Er, um... Sorry, I'm just gonna...

22:48.219 --> 22:49.652
Okay.
just gonna count these out.

22:49.654 --> 22:51.070
That's a little
condescending.

22:51.072 --> 22:53.555
You know what, Apollo?

22:55.559 --> 22:56.692
Show me what you got.

22:56.694 --> 22:57.776
I feel dirty.

22:57.778 --> 22:58.944
Aah!

22:58.946 --> 23:00.162
Boom!

23:00.164 --> 23:01.614
That's what
I'm talking about.

23:01.616 --> 23:03.899
Drop it like it's hot.

23:03.901 --> 23:06.068
Don't worry, we're gonna
do our best to find him.

23:06.070 --> 23:09.371
Is there anything else
you can remember?

23:09.373 --> 23:12.625
A few days ago
Amir began acting strange.

23:12.627 --> 23:14.343
He even showed up
with bruises,

23:14.345 --> 23:16.128
like he'd been in a fight.

23:16.130 --> 23:17.796
Did he have any issues
with anyone?

23:17.798 --> 23:19.265
Not that I know of.

23:19.267 --> 23:20.716
The only time
I've ever seen him

23:20.718 --> 23:23.719
in an argument
was with his uncle.

23:23.721 --> 23:25.971
Sad to say,
it was over me.

23:25.973 --> 23:27.606
Why over you?

23:27.608 --> 23:30.592
'Cause I'm a bad influence.

23:30.594 --> 23:32.478
"Too American."

23:32.480 --> 23:33.696
Yusef holds him back.

23:33.698 --> 23:35.197
Wants him to be
something he's not.

23:35.199 --> 23:36.265
And what's that?

23:36.267 --> 23:38.033
Him.

23:38.035 --> 23:41.270
An elder statesman
of a lost culture.

23:42.989 --> 23:44.406
Okay. Thank you.

23:44.408 --> 23:47.626
Let us know if anything else
comes to mind.

23:47.628 --> 23:49.611
Is he going to be okay?

23:49.613 --> 23:51.297
We hope so.

23:51.299 --> 23:53.499
Thank you.

23:59.139 --> 24:01.957
<i>Kaleidoscope got a hit on the</i>
<i>shooter's van at this location.</i>

24:01.959 --> 24:04.510
<i>It's a mosque. Makes sense.</i>

24:06.763 --> 24:08.397
<i>And there it is.</i>

24:10.267 --> 24:12.184
Looks different without
automatic gunfire

24:12.186 --> 24:13.269
pouring from it.

24:13.271 --> 24:14.687
Let's sit on it.

24:14.689 --> 24:16.522
See if we catch a fly.

24:28.251 --> 24:31.203
Handsome bunch.

24:31.205 --> 24:33.005
How you doing with all this?

24:33.007 --> 24:34.340
What do you mean?

24:36.676 --> 24:39.044
Well, it is possible that
you're too close to this case.

24:39.046 --> 24:41.714
Not close enough.

24:44.100 --> 24:45.801
I should have kept
a closer eye on them,

24:45.803 --> 24:47.469
since I'm the one
who brought them here.

24:48.362 --> 24:51.665
You can't keep an eye
on everyone.

24:51.667 --> 24:53.717
I can watch
my friends.

24:53.719 --> 24:55.385
That's what I'm talking about.

24:55.387 --> 24:58.588
You just can't help getting
involved in people's lives.

24:58.590 --> 25:00.006
You did it with Moe,

25:00.008 --> 25:01.308
and now you're
doing it with Yusef.

25:01.310 --> 25:03.760
Why is it that every time
I try to do the right thing,

25:03.762 --> 25:05.762
people get hurt,

25:05.764 --> 25:07.681
kidnapped...

25:07.683 --> 25:09.850
die?

25:13.487 --> 25:15.822
You got a big heart, Sam.

25:17.892 --> 25:20.277
Like a big...

25:20.279 --> 25:22.712
giant teddy bear.

25:26.751 --> 25:28.335
Do you want a hug?

25:30.504 --> 25:32.238
Heads up.

25:32.240 --> 25:35.425
Isn't that
the shooter's brother?

25:35.427 --> 25:37.544
Yeah. Salim Durrani.

25:45.303 --> 25:47.103
You thinking what I'm thinking?

25:47.105 --> 25:49.606
Yup.

25:49.608 --> 25:51.591
He may be able to lead us

25:51.593 --> 25:52.759
to Amir.

25:52.761 --> 25:54.277
So, Amir gets recruited,

25:54.279 --> 25:56.980
but then he falls out of favor
with the same guys.

25:56.982 --> 25:58.114
Why?

25:58.116 --> 25:59.532
Maybe they asked him to do

25:59.534 --> 26:00.867
something and he refused.

26:00.869 --> 26:03.536
That'd explain the gun
under his bed.

26:05.539 --> 26:07.557
Here we go.

26:10.611 --> 26:12.412
What do you
have, Eric?

26:12.414 --> 26:14.798
Amir was sending e-mails
from the store computer.

26:14.800 --> 26:15.966
To Habib?

26:15.968 --> 26:17.133
I am not sure.

26:17.135 --> 26:18.218
But they contained dates,

26:18.220 --> 26:19.953
times and locations.

26:19.955 --> 26:21.721
One of the locations
was the Laundromat

26:21.723 --> 26:23.139
where the drive-by
took place.

26:23.141 --> 26:24.975
So he set up his own uncle.

26:24.977 --> 26:27.060
And then stole the laptop
to cover his tracks.

26:27.062 --> 26:28.061
What do you got, Nell?

26:28.063 --> 26:29.646
NSA cell phone intercepts.

26:29.648 --> 26:31.598
Chatter is on the rise.
It's all coded.

26:31.600 --> 26:34.401
The term "ambassador"
is used multiple times,

26:34.403 --> 26:37.437
as well as the phrase
"death to all infidels."

26:37.439 --> 26:39.990
These guys need
some new material.

26:41.943 --> 26:43.193
If Habib's involved,

26:43.195 --> 26:46.696
it's gonna be something
on a large scale.

26:49.500 --> 26:53.169
Salim's taking
a midday hookah break.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.455
Looks like I'm on.

26:55.457 --> 26:56.990
Why you?

26:56.992 --> 26:59.759
You don't speak hookah.

26:59.761 --> 27:02.679
We both know that.

27:16.110 --> 27:17.978
Excuse me?

27:17.980 --> 27:19.312
Could you set me up?

27:19.314 --> 27:21.865
My shrink says I need to get out
and explore new cultures.

27:21.867 --> 27:23.316
Okay.

27:36.547 --> 27:39.466
Something has Salim
riled up.

27:46.475 --> 27:48.608
He may have
made me.

27:48.610 --> 27:51.261
Sounds like your hookah's
a little rusty.

28:00.154 --> 28:02.555
Headed to the restroom.

28:11.949 --> 28:14.200
G, we got a runner.

28:14.202 --> 28:16.786
Meet me around back.

28:28.599 --> 28:29.799
Two guys,
silver sedan.

28:29.801 --> 28:31.217
Hang a right.

28:33.888 --> 28:35.355
Buckle up. Take notes.

28:39.543 --> 28:41.761
<i>There they go.</i>

28:45.399 --> 28:46.783
<i>Where the hell are they?</i>

28:53.507 --> 28:55.125
I'm warning you, G,
don't scratch my car.

28:56.128 --> 28:57.293
They got behind us.

29:00.965 --> 29:02.465
Need a shot, G.

29:02.467 --> 29:03.833
Coming up.

29:05.086 --> 29:06.553
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

29:20.234 --> 29:21.734
Put your hands
where I can see them!

29:21.736 --> 29:23.853
Turn around.
Turn around!

29:23.855 --> 29:25.572
Face down on the ground.

29:25.574 --> 29:28.141
Get down. Get down.

29:28.143 --> 29:30.143
Put your hands behind your back.

29:38.335 --> 29:39.586
Driver's dead.

29:39.588 --> 29:40.703
You good?

29:40.705 --> 29:41.988
Yeah.

29:41.990 --> 29:44.340
You're gonna pay
for my car window.

29:44.342 --> 29:45.875
It's my baby.

29:52.266 --> 29:53.800
Sam.

29:54.885 --> 29:56.519
Yeah.

29:57.938 --> 30:00.306
Looks like they're getting
ready to go to war.

30:12.944 --> 30:14.995
Officer.

30:16.864 --> 30:18.231
You get anything?

30:18.233 --> 30:19.733
Useless.

30:19.735 --> 30:21.335
We got to find Amir.

30:21.337 --> 30:22.619
Or stop him.

30:22.621 --> 30:23.837
We don't know which.

30:23.839 --> 30:25.539
Either way...

30:25.541 --> 30:28.375
he's in the middle
of something bad.

30:30.628 --> 30:32.679
Fancy driving.

30:34.215 --> 30:35.915
You'll be
glad to know

30:35.917 --> 30:37.634
the Challenger's being repaired.

30:37.636 --> 30:38.685
Wow.

30:38.687 --> 30:40.187
That was fast.

30:40.189 --> 30:41.254
Thank you, Hetty.

30:41.256 --> 30:42.522
Oh, don't.

30:42.524 --> 30:44.891
This is coming
out of your paycheck.

30:44.893 --> 30:48.195
Mr. Callen, a word, please.

30:51.482 --> 30:52.950
We split it 50-50?

30:52.952 --> 30:54.985
How about all to nothing?

30:58.906 --> 31:01.074
Uh...

31:01.076 --> 31:04.161
got some mad
driving skills here.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.499
What?

31:09.501 --> 31:11.835
Something I said?

31:11.837 --> 31:12.836
Wasn't me.

31:12.838 --> 31:13.887
Wha...

31:13.889 --> 31:16.506
You let Callen drive
the Challenger?

31:16.508 --> 31:18.124
It was an emergency.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.559
Anything on Nicole Benet?

31:19.561 --> 31:21.628
Typical college kid.

31:21.630 --> 31:23.797
Seems to genuinely be
in love with Amir.

31:23.799 --> 31:25.098
Really?

31:25.100 --> 31:26.132
You let Callen drive

31:26.134 --> 31:27.401
your car?

31:29.654 --> 31:32.939
Let's get Nicole and Yusef
in the same room.

31:33.992 --> 31:35.308
Maybe they know
something collectively

31:35.310 --> 31:36.476
and they don't realize it.

31:36.478 --> 31:38.028
Clearly they're not
feeling each other.

31:38.030 --> 31:39.329
Well,

31:39.331 --> 31:42.115
well, they have to get over it
if they want to help Amir.

31:42.117 --> 31:45.252
I'll meet you at the boatshed
once you bring Nicole in.

31:45.254 --> 31:48.438
If Habib is successful,

31:48.440 --> 31:51.842
I'm afraid this could become
a breeding ground

31:51.844 --> 31:53.960
for homegrown terrorist cells.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.831
We'll take care of Habib.

32:00.668 --> 32:02.135
Now, why don't you tell me

32:02.137 --> 32:03.837
what you're really
concerned about?

32:06.057 --> 32:07.858
Sam?

32:07.860 --> 32:10.727
More importantly, his judgment.

32:10.729 --> 32:13.814
I worry that
it could be clouded

32:13.816 --> 32:15.866
by his sense of obligation.

32:15.868 --> 32:18.652
Me, too.

32:18.654 --> 32:21.321
You will keep an eye on him?

32:21.323 --> 32:24.190
Don't I always?

32:33.217 --> 32:34.551
Yeah, thanks for nothing.

32:34.553 --> 32:35.886
They won't refund me
for the seminar.

32:35.888 --> 32:37.471
What am I supposed to do
with these tickets?

32:37.473 --> 32:39.038
I know what you can
do with the tickets.

32:39.040 --> 32:39.990
Okay, that's just mean.

32:49.150 --> 32:51.902
One, two, three.

32:51.904 --> 32:53.487
Federal agents!

33:10.922 --> 33:12.873
I got no shot.

33:26.086 --> 33:28.054
Nicole.

33:28.056 --> 33:30.307
All right, sweetheart,
stay calm.

33:32.143 --> 33:33.927
Come here...

33:33.929 --> 33:35.529
You're okay, you're
okay, you're okay.

33:36.364 --> 33:37.697
It's gonna
be all right.

33:37.699 --> 33:39.065
It's gonna be fine.

33:39.067 --> 33:40.450
Yo.

33:40.452 --> 33:42.602
Eric, I need an ambulance
at our current location. GSW,

33:42.604 --> 33:43.987
female. Not Kensi.
You got it?

33:43.989 --> 33:44.955
Got it.

33:44.957 --> 33:46.623
Just breathe.

33:46.625 --> 33:47.941
Breathe in.

33:49.710 --> 33:51.328
Breathe with me.

33:51.330 --> 33:52.996
Her pulse is weak
but steady.

33:52.998 --> 33:54.047
Kensi.

33:54.049 --> 33:55.966
You got to see this.

34:01.122 --> 34:03.122
That looks like Afghanistan.

34:05.426 --> 34:06.977
That's the address
of the Laundromat

34:06.979 --> 34:08.562
where they tried
to kill Yusef.

34:08.563 --> 34:11.648
The hit wasn't meant for Yusef.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.850
They were going after Sam.

34:20.107 --> 34:22.275
Wilson?

34:23.444 --> 34:25.645
Agent Wilson?

34:26.746 --> 34:29.248
Yusef, where's the guard?

34:30.034 --> 34:33.152
I'm sorry, Sam.
Amir called.

34:33.154 --> 34:35.338
I told him where I was.

34:37.792 --> 34:40.627
Amir.

34:40.629 --> 34:42.661
You okay?

34:42.664 --> 34:44.163
I will be soon.

34:44.165 --> 34:45.966
I'm sorry.

34:46.601 --> 34:47.766
Drop your weapon!

34:47.768 --> 34:49.603
I wouldn't do that.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.405
So, now we will finish

35:08.407 --> 35:11.875
what should have been finished
years ago--

35:11.877 --> 35:15.712
kill the one
that got away.

35:31.567 --> 35:33.351
Sam's cell is either
switched off or dead,

35:33.353 --> 35:34.603
and I got a GPS location

35:34.605 --> 35:36.638
on the Challenger.

35:36.640 --> 35:38.857
It's parked
right outside the boatshed.

35:38.859 --> 35:41.827
I want eyes inside the
boatshed now, Mr. Beale.

35:41.829 --> 35:44.112
I'm on it.

35:44.114 --> 35:46.114
Okay. This is not good.

35:46.116 --> 35:48.650
All the cameras have been
disconnected from the source.

35:48.652 --> 35:50.252
Not all of 'em.

35:54.157 --> 35:56.258
Get a crash team

35:56.260 --> 35:58.210
there now.

35:58.212 --> 36:01.012
Nell, inform Callen
and the others.

36:01.014 --> 36:02.664
The boatshed
has been breached.

36:02.666 --> 36:04.883
We can't afford
to let Habib escape.

36:05.718 --> 36:07.686
To hell with Habib.

36:07.688 --> 36:09.771
Save Sam.

36:16.011 --> 36:17.646
How could you do this?

36:17.648 --> 36:20.348
If Sam dies, our family
has died in vain.

36:20.448 --> 36:22.826
I'm tired of carrying
your burden, Uncle.

36:23.320 --> 36:27.455
Our family died because of your
decision to save this outsider.

36:27.457 --> 36:29.491
Because of you.

36:29.493 --> 36:32.026
I'm tired of running.

36:33.629 --> 36:35.964
You can't trust them, Amir.

36:45.759 --> 36:47.875
You have me.

36:47.877 --> 36:49.895
Let 'em go.

36:51.899 --> 36:54.716
I don't think you're in
any position to be negotiating,

36:54.718 --> 36:56.735
my friend.

36:56.737 --> 36:58.720
Besides,

36:58.722 --> 37:00.188
they deserve to suffer
the same fate

37:00.190 --> 37:02.390
for helping you
in the first place.

37:02.392 --> 37:03.775
But you said that...

37:03.777 --> 37:04.526
Silence!

37:08.031 --> 37:11.032
What kind of man...

37:11.034 --> 37:13.668
turns on his own family?

37:13.670 --> 37:15.570
Hmm?

37:16.405 --> 37:19.341
You are a coward.

37:19.343 --> 37:21.343
You betrayed your uncle

37:21.345 --> 37:24.412
and you betrayed Allah.

37:24.414 --> 37:29.718
And your death will serve
as a lesson for many.

37:29.720 --> 37:32.920
As will
your public execution.

37:33.756 --> 37:35.140
Crash team is
ten minutes out.

37:35.142 --> 37:37.359
Sam doesn't have ten minutes.

37:42.231 --> 37:44.065
Draw their attention
to the east wall.

37:44.067 --> 37:45.367
What are you gonna do?

37:45.369 --> 37:47.435
I'm coming in
through the basement.

37:47.437 --> 37:49.654
We have a basement?

37:52.208 --> 37:54.409
<i>Lokhay Warkawal.</i>

37:54.411 --> 37:56.444
It's the way of your people.

37:56.446 --> 37:59.714
It's older than
the Holy Koran.

38:01.334 --> 38:03.034
Yusef did nothing wrong.

38:03.952 --> 38:08.289
He gave shelter
and comfort to our enemy.

38:09.725 --> 38:14.462
And now the message that we send

38:14.464 --> 38:17.766
is that there is nowhere
on this earth

38:17.768 --> 38:20.468
that we will not go
to punish those

38:20.470 --> 38:23.071
who do not obey Taliban law.

38:23.073 --> 38:24.138
Are you serious?!

38:24.140 --> 38:25.607
It's never gonna
happen again.

38:25.609 --> 38:28.827
It should never have
happened in the first place.

38:28.829 --> 38:29.911
Who is that?

38:32.649 --> 38:34.416
What do you want
me to say here?

38:34.418 --> 38:36.150
How many more times
can I apologize?

38:36.152 --> 38:38.286
What?
I'm saying...

38:38.288 --> 38:40.088
It's a man
and woman arguing.

38:40.090 --> 38:42.424
Go.

38:42.426 --> 38:44.158
And if they get too close,

38:44.160 --> 38:45.326
get rid of them.

38:45.328 --> 38:48.663
Sorry is not enough.

39:06.198 --> 39:08.033
In position.

39:08.035 --> 39:10.652
Callen, I only have eyes on
three of the four targets.

39:10.654 --> 39:12.203
The fourth was last seen

39:12.205 --> 39:13.872
in the hall by Interrogation.

39:13.874 --> 39:16.074
Copy.

39:23.632 --> 39:25.133
Kensi,

39:25.135 --> 39:28.703
Deeks, on my three...

39:28.705 --> 39:30.705
two, one.

39:46.273 --> 39:47.522
Get down.

39:47.524 --> 39:48.740
Let's go.

39:48.742 --> 39:50.358
Got you, buddy.

39:50.360 --> 39:51.526
Okay.

39:53.897 --> 39:56.063
Come here...

39:57.416 --> 39:59.584
We're safe, Amir.

40:06.959 --> 40:09.177
Others will still come.

40:14.350 --> 40:16.250
Amir,

40:16.252 --> 40:18.219
we can put you
in witness protection.

40:20.272 --> 40:22.674
And what about Nicole?
What will you do for her?

40:22.676 --> 40:25.092
Nicole was shot

40:25.094 --> 40:26.528
when Habib's men tried
to grab her.

40:26.530 --> 40:28.262
To make sure
you followed through.

40:28.264 --> 40:31.265
She's in the hospital,
but she's gonna be okay.

40:31.267 --> 40:33.201
This is your fault.

40:33.203 --> 40:34.986
Your fault!

40:34.988 --> 40:37.989
Amir. Don't do this.

40:51.003 --> 40:53.505
I'm sorry, Amir.

40:53.507 --> 40:56.224
I'm so sorry, nephew.

40:58.293 --> 41:01.763
I couldn't let him
take your life,

41:01.765 --> 41:04.432
or everyone would
have died in vain.

41:07.570 --> 41:10.271
He's finally free.

41:19.198 --> 41:22.534
"The taking
of one innocent life

41:22.536 --> 41:25.370
is like taking the life
of all Mankind."

41:25.372 --> 41:27.338
"And the saving of one life

41:27.340 --> 41:29.874
is like the saving
of all Mankind."

41:29.876 --> 41:32.844
Know this, Sam.

41:32.846 --> 41:37.182
I made the decisions I believed
in my heart to be right.

41:37.184 --> 41:40.768
Allah will forgive me.
Amir was

41:40.770 --> 41:43.104
the last of my family.

41:43.106 --> 41:45.006
No.

41:45.858 --> 41:48.276
Not the last.

41:52.681 --> 41:54.866
Thank you.

41:57.570 --> 42:01.322
<i>Some of the greatest men</i>
<i>are shaped</i>

42:01.324 --> 42:05.193
<i>by the difficult decisions</i>
<i>they had to make.</i>

42:06.128 --> 42:09.497
I know this is a tough time
for you, Sam,

42:09.499 --> 42:11.583
and I've made
a decision

42:11.585 --> 42:13.301
to still punish you

42:13.303 --> 42:17.472
for consistently disobeying
my orders regarding

42:17.474 --> 42:18.973
federal resources.

42:18.975 --> 42:20.391
Really, Hetty?

42:20.393 --> 42:22.043
Now?

42:26.181 --> 42:28.382
And here's your punishment.

42:30.552 --> 42:32.270
One of the finest

42:32.272 --> 42:35.356
Scotch whiskeys ever made.

42:41.413 --> 42:43.397
Mmm.

42:43.399 --> 42:45.166
Wow.

42:47.050 --> 42:49.051
How much does this stuff cost?

42:52.536 --> 42:53.752
You'll find out
next paycheck.
