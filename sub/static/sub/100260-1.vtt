00:43.351 --> 00:45.415
So beautiful. Gorgeous!

00:45.417 --> 00:47.249
Just like your Kamran.

00:47.251 --> 00:50.217
He is the perfect match
for our Nousha.

00:58.950 --> 00:59.984
Nousha?

01:01.783 --> 01:02.817
Coming!

01:14.217 --> 01:15.781
- Babe?
- Yeah.

01:15.783 --> 01:17.915
- Hurry up. My mom's waiting.
- Yeah.

01:17.917 --> 01:19.715
- Where are your shoes?
- Right here.

01:19.717 --> 01:20.915
Okay, don't forget
to light the candles.

01:20.917 --> 01:22.015
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay?

01:22.017 --> 01:23.015
Yeah, I got you.

01:23.017 --> 01:24.050
- All right.

- Nousha.
- Nousha.

02:13.384 --> 02:14.717
We need to talk.

02:15.783 --> 02:16.783
Yeah.

02:18.417 --> 02:21.149
Uh, we...

02:21.151 --> 02:24.449
I mean I think that...

02:24.451 --> 02:28.848
You may not be the best fit
for our Kamran, okay?

02:28.850 --> 02:31.917
- Oh.
- Are you breaking up with me?

02:34.251 --> 02:36.482
Is your mother
breaking up with me?

02:36.484 --> 02:39.948
We want the ring back.

02:39.950 --> 02:41.315
Ohh...

02:41.317 --> 02:42.748
Give it back.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.982
Give it back.

02:51.017 --> 02:53.115
These people are fake.

02:53.117 --> 02:54.215
I love you.

02:56.351 --> 02:59.015
She is freak.

02:59.017 --> 03:00.184
Such a freak.

03:01.717 --> 03:02.750
Come along.

03:50.717 --> 03:52.249
Come on, come on.
Do you feel that burn?

03:52.251 --> 03:53.315
Four, three.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.282
Spooky girl in the back,

03:55.284 --> 03:56.982
why you goin' so slow?

03:56.984 --> 03:59.717
This isn't a yoga class.
Move those legs!

04:32.417 --> 04:34.748
Who loves mommy?
Does Lulu love mommy?

04:36.151 --> 04:37.848
What'd you say?

04:37.850 --> 04:40.082
Did you just say Dartmouth?

04:40.084 --> 04:41.449
She's a genius.

04:41.451 --> 04:43.084
I can already tell
by her speech pattern.

04:45.217 --> 04:47.815
Personally, I'm relieved
that it's all over.

04:47.817 --> 04:49.982
How did I let it get that far?
Did I even love him?

04:49.984 --> 04:51.015
No.

04:51.017 --> 04:52.415
You sabotaged the entire thing.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.115
You were dickmatized.

04:54.117 --> 04:55.982
Explain yourself.
Come here.

04:55.984 --> 04:57.382
You were in love
with his dick.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.848
You only talked about
how great the sex was.

04:59.850 --> 05:01.282
You never talked about anything

05:01.284 --> 05:03.048
that you actually
liked about him

05:03.050 --> 05:06.115
or anything that you guys
had in common.

05:06.117 --> 05:08.182
Why did you guys
not tell me sooner?

05:08.184 --> 05:11.215
Oh, God. We didn't wanna
interrupt your dickathalon.

05:11.217 --> 05:12.882
Plus, Missy beloved him,

05:12.884 --> 05:14.982
and you don't like
to disappoint Missy.

05:14.984 --> 05:17.282
I mean, nobody does.

05:17.284 --> 05:18.349
She convinced me
I was straight once.

05:18.351 --> 05:19.982
Remember Michael?

05:19.984 --> 05:22.317
Oh, my God.
I was doing him for my mom.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.315
And you liked it.

05:28.317 --> 05:30.848
It's my fault.

05:30.850 --> 05:33.215
Actually,
it's your father's fault.

05:33.217 --> 05:35.848
He let you be too American.

05:35.850 --> 05:38.884
But it's not too late.
We can fix this.

05:43.817 --> 05:46.382
- Hello.
- Oh, Ziba.

05:46.384 --> 05:49.151
Hi, how are you?

05:51.817 --> 05:52.882
Nousha, come.

05:52.884 --> 05:55.015
Hi, Aunt Sousa.

05:55.017 --> 05:57.948
Nousha, what happened to
that rock on your finger?

05:57.950 --> 05:59.948
They weren't good enough.

05:59.950 --> 06:01.815
I heard they were
filing for bankruptcy.

06:01.817 --> 06:03.382
Mom!

06:03.384 --> 06:05.149
He was impotent.

06:05.151 --> 06:06.915
That's not true.
It didn't work out.

06:06.917 --> 06:09.249
Oh, don't worry, Aziza.

06:09.251 --> 06:10.882
Don't worry.
I have a son.

06:10.884 --> 06:12.748
30 years old,
and he likes older women.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.382
I wanna show the picture.
Look at that.

06:14.384 --> 06:15.449
Look at the picture.

06:15.451 --> 06:17.282
Here, here, look at that.

06:17.284 --> 06:18.217
More, more.

06:22.451 --> 06:24.650
Look at that one.
Look at this one.

06:26.850 --> 06:28.815
- Wow.
- He's just like his father

06:28.817 --> 06:30.750
in that department.

06:32.284 --> 06:34.781
Look at that.

06:34.783 --> 06:36.351
Look at that boy.

06:44.284 --> 06:46.115
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:46.117 --> 06:48.848
Are you okay?

06:48.850 --> 06:50.650
So sorry, Noush.

06:52.117 --> 06:54.384
- Hi.
- You okay?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.748
Nousha, are you coming to
the rally tomorrow night?

06:58.750 --> 06:59.748
Yas.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.215
- Yas?
- Yes.

07:01.217 --> 07:03.748
We need at least 100 people
there to get some press.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.715
Babe, I'll be there.

07:05.717 --> 07:06.815
You better be.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.382
- Yeah.
- Hang in there, girl.

07:08.384 --> 07:10.115
Lynne, does everybody
know my business?

07:10.117 --> 07:12.182
Yeah. RJ, are you coming
to the rally tomorrow?

07:12.184 --> 07:14.015
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.715
You shared it on all of our
social media platforms, right?

07:15.717 --> 07:17.048
It's been on Facebook,

07:17.050 --> 07:18.948
and everybody has said
they were coming.

07:18.950 --> 07:20.882
- There's like 100 people.
- I'll believe it when I see it.

07:20.884 --> 07:22.082
Everyone's a Facebook activist.

07:22.084 --> 07:23.215
When it comes to
actually showing up,

07:23.217 --> 07:24.982
they'd rather go to happy hour.

07:24.984 --> 07:27.115
Happy hour is more fun than
protesting sexual assault.

07:27.117 --> 07:29.449
- Shut up, RJ.
- Okay, okay, enough, enough.

07:29.451 --> 07:32.748
Did you get all the declarations
for the Jones' case?

07:32.750 --> 07:34.082
Thank you.

07:34.084 --> 07:35.082
I need your draft of the memo.

07:35.084 --> 07:36.848
I'm 100% on it.

07:36.850 --> 07:38.815
It's just that part of
the research was unclear,

07:38.817 --> 07:40.082
so I had to verify
with co-counsel

07:40.084 --> 07:41.748
and they're really slow
to respond.

07:41.750 --> 07:44.715
I don't care.
Just figure it out today.

07:44.717 --> 07:47.082
Actually, I was able
to get clarification.

07:47.084 --> 07:48.715
- I finished the draft.
- Great.

07:48.717 --> 07:51.482
I figured you had
so much on your plate.

07:51.484 --> 07:53.715
I don't need you to do my job.
I was on it.

07:53.717 --> 07:55.315
I heard you got dumped.

07:55.317 --> 07:57.182
- Out of my office.
- Please show up for the rally.

07:57.184 --> 08:00.249
- Do not leave me hanging.
- We're coming to your rally.

08:00.251 --> 08:03.715
And just so you know,
I'm available.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.449
- No.
- You sure?

08:05.451 --> 08:08.449
I'll make sure you get
a gold medal at this...

08:08.451 --> 08:09.882
dickathalon.

08:09.884 --> 08:11.249
Lynne?

08:11.251 --> 08:12.982
What's up, sweetie?

08:12.984 --> 08:14.848
Did you tell
everybody my business?

08:14.850 --> 08:16.848
I definitely did.
See you at the rally.

08:16.850 --> 08:19.217
I'm sorry, are you all
still in my office?

08:21.217 --> 08:23.650
I will think about it.

08:30.884 --> 08:33.282
I can't sleep
until you get married.

08:33.284 --> 08:35.116
I can probably get you
some Ambien.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.482
I don't think
you tried hard enough.

08:38.484 --> 08:40.815
What if I didn't really
like him, Mom?

08:40.817 --> 08:42.182
You should try again.

08:42.183 --> 08:44.349
You're running out of time,
you know?

08:46.084 --> 08:48.048
She's a lesbian.

08:48.050 --> 08:50.715
Maybe you should stop
hanging out with those girls.

08:50.717 --> 08:53.349
Mom, get off my case, okay?

08:53.351 --> 08:55.215
I need some time to find myself.

08:55.217 --> 08:57.082
Oh, find yourself.

08:57.084 --> 08:58.781
What do you mean,
find yourself?

08:58.783 --> 09:01.915
There you are, I found you.
Now find a husband.

09:01.917 --> 09:06.082
How has marriage even
survived as an institution?

09:06.084 --> 09:09.781
Our values have totally shifted.

09:09.783 --> 09:12.382
There's been radical
social upheaval,

09:12.384 --> 09:16.115
gender equality,
female empowerment.

09:16.117 --> 09:17.715
I have arranged for you
to go out

09:17.717 --> 09:19.382
with Dr. Asad's son tomorrow.

09:19.384 --> 09:21.982
- I can't tomorrow.
- He has a PhD.

09:21.984 --> 09:23.781
It's Lynne's protest tomorrow,
Mom. I can't.

09:23.783 --> 09:26.982
You go to protests
all the time.

09:26.984 --> 09:29.015
What's wrong with you?

09:29.017 --> 09:30.015
Are you a communist?

09:30.017 --> 09:32.182
All lesbians are communists.

09:32.184 --> 09:33.982
Careful.

09:33.984 --> 09:35.215
Aren't they?

09:35.217 --> 09:37.382
Hey, hey, ho, ho!

09:37.384 --> 09:38.915
Patriarchy has got to go!

09:38.917 --> 09:41.048
Hey, hey, ho, ho!

09:41.050 --> 09:42.715
Patriarchy has got to go!

09:42.717 --> 09:44.748
I can't believe this turnout.
I knew it.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.715
I thought people
cared more than this.

09:46.717 --> 09:48.048
Everybody's at happy hour.

09:48.050 --> 09:49.482
Here, just maybe
this'll liven things up.

09:49.484 --> 09:51.382
Hold this.
I hold every...

09:51.384 --> 09:53.482
- Oh, ho!
- Yeah.

09:53.484 --> 09:55.748
Way to challenge the male gays.

09:55.750 --> 09:58.015
While I beat around that bush.

09:58.017 --> 09:59.415
That is huge.

09:59.417 --> 10:01.915
Hey, hey, ho, ho!
Patriarchy has got to go!

10:01.917 --> 10:03.249
Oh, my God,
it's the Menstruals.

10:03.251 --> 10:04.915
- Who are they?
- This old male feminist group.

10:04.917 --> 10:06.215
I read about them on Buzzfeed.

10:06.217 --> 10:08.182
They like show up and protest.

10:08.184 --> 10:10.848
They're performance artists,
just doin' stuff like that.

10:10.850 --> 10:12.948
Hi, guys.
Mind if we join?

10:12.950 --> 10:14.415
We would love that.
How did you hear about this?

10:14.417 --> 10:15.815
Are you kidding?
We're all huge followers

10:15.817 --> 10:17.349
of Pussies Against Patriarchy.

10:17.351 --> 10:18.349
That's my page.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.715
Oh, cool.

10:19.717 --> 10:21.149
Hi, I'm Alex.

10:21.151 --> 10:22.848
- I'm Lynne.
- I'm Tessa.

10:22.850 --> 10:24.149
I'm Nousha.

10:24.151 --> 10:26.850
Hi, Nousha.
I love your penis.

10:28.917 --> 10:30.249
Thanks.
Let's do this!

10:30.251 --> 10:31.449
All right.

10:31.451 --> 10:33.349
Hey, hey, ho, ho!

10:33.351 --> 10:35.115
Patriarchy has got to go!

10:35.117 --> 10:36.982
Hey, hey, ho, ho!

10:36.984 --> 10:38.715
Patriarchy has got to go!

10:38.717 --> 10:40.815
Hey, hey, ho, ho!

10:40.817 --> 10:42.015
Patriarchy has got to go!

10:42.017 --> 10:43.117
Hey, hey!

10:45.451 --> 10:47.349
Patriarchy has got to go!

10:47.351 --> 10:49.382
Hey, hey, ho, ho!

10:49.384 --> 10:50.482
Patriarchy has got to go!

10:50.484 --> 10:52.215
Hey, Nousha, wait up.

10:52.217 --> 10:53.815
Hey, do you wanna come with us

10:53.817 --> 10:55.715
to the anti-oligarchy
rally downtown?

10:55.717 --> 10:57.082
It'll be fun.

10:57.084 --> 10:59.082
I can't, but thank you
for the invite.

10:59.084 --> 11:01.948
Okay, I got a great shot
of you and your penis saved.

11:02.984 --> 11:04.482
I could send it to you.

11:04.484 --> 11:07.783
Yeah, sure. Here's my card.

11:08.884 --> 11:10.182
There you go.

11:10.184 --> 11:12.415
Oh, card.
That's really '90s.

11:12.417 --> 11:15.850
Great, yeah.
Hit me up. Cool.

11:17.184 --> 11:18.781
Okay, well, have fun.

11:18.783 --> 11:20.815
- See ya.
- Okay.

11:20.817 --> 11:22.151
Bye.

11:40.984 --> 11:42.317
She's here.

11:45.317 --> 11:49.282
Oh, hi, Nousha.
Look who came by for a visit.

11:49.284 --> 11:50.781
- Hello.
- Hi.

11:50.783 --> 11:52.149
Hi.

11:52.151 --> 11:55.151
Why don't you get some tea
for our guests?

12:01.317 --> 12:04.184
She's so cute.

12:13.917 --> 12:15.882
Mom, can you
come in here, please?

12:15.884 --> 12:17.748
Excuse me.

12:17.750 --> 12:18.817
Of course.

12:25.084 --> 12:26.384
What?

12:27.484 --> 12:29.215
Tell 'em to leave.

12:29.217 --> 12:33.015
Oh, my God.

12:33.017 --> 12:35.117
You're killing me.

12:43.217 --> 12:45.215
Unfortunately,
she's not feeling well.

12:45.217 --> 12:46.917
So sorry.

13:01.984 --> 13:04.215
Oh, hey there, Ms. Smiley.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.315
That guy just texted me.

13:05.317 --> 13:07.449
- Who?
- The guy.

13:07.451 --> 13:10.149
Oh, yeah, I saw your little
moment with Menstrual white boy.

13:10.151 --> 13:11.382
- Did you text him back?
- No.

13:11.384 --> 13:12.449
Ask him out.

13:12.451 --> 13:14.781
I don't even know him.

13:14.783 --> 13:16.384
- Let's stalk.
- Yes.

13:18.251 --> 13:21.182
Alex Talbot.

13:21.184 --> 13:22.182
Talbot.

13:22.184 --> 13:23.848
Okay.

13:23.850 --> 13:26.249
Okay, according
to his Facebook interest

13:26.251 --> 13:28.382
he's a feminist,
he's into conceptual art,

13:28.384 --> 13:30.848
supporter of LGBT causes
and even deejays.

13:30.850 --> 13:33.349
- This guy's awesome.
- But not husband material.

13:33.351 --> 13:35.082
I'll never bring a guy
like that home.

13:35.084 --> 13:36.449
My parents would freak out.

13:36.451 --> 13:38.781
Plus, look at his pictures.
He's gay.

13:38.783 --> 13:40.415
You don't know that.
Just message him.

13:40.417 --> 13:42.748
- No.
- What is going on in here?

13:42.750 --> 13:44.815
- No, no, no, no, no.
- That's what's happening.

13:44.817 --> 13:45.882
No!

13:45.884 --> 13:47.082
Oh!

13:47.084 --> 13:48.482
Are you texting him
right now?

13:48.484 --> 13:51.417
- I got you, girl.
- What are you typing?

13:52.884 --> 13:54.715
Ding!
Looks like you got a date.

13:57.117 --> 14:00.315
Back on the market.

14:00.317 --> 14:04.817
I'm also
still on the market, so...

14:08.451 --> 14:11.151
Hmm? Did you say something?

14:23.251 --> 14:26.082
Okay, tell me
three things about you.

14:26.084 --> 14:30.048
I grew up in Orange County,
but my parents are from Iran.

14:30.050 --> 14:34.082
You know, that super peaceful
country in the Middle East.

14:34.084 --> 14:35.115
- I've heard of it.
- Mm-hmm.

14:35.117 --> 14:37.482
And... I don't know.

14:37.484 --> 14:39.082
Something fun.

14:39.084 --> 14:40.982
- I don't know.
- Okay, something like...

14:40.984 --> 14:43.449
who's your favorite
celebrity crush?

14:43.451 --> 14:44.748
David Hasselhoff.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.482
Just like that?
Mine too.

14:47.484 --> 14:50.315
Really?

14:50.317 --> 14:51.848
What about you?

14:51.850 --> 14:53.783
Okay, I'd never
tell anyone this.

14:55.850 --> 14:58.882
- Celine Dion.
- You're joking.

14:58.884 --> 15:01.182
Nope. She's smoking.
Ever since I was 12 years old,

15:01.184 --> 15:03.715
I see her, I hear her,
I am rock hard.

15:03.717 --> 15:05.482
Okay, that's super weird

15:05.484 --> 15:08.315
because I do a killer
Celine Dion impersonation.

15:08.317 --> 15:10.048
- No.
- Yes,

15:10.050 --> 15:12.315
My mom was obsessed with her
when I was growing up,

15:12.317 --> 15:14.948
so I would imitate her
to make my mom like me.

15:14.950 --> 15:17.815
Okay, do it.

15:17.817 --> 15:20.715
No way.
That's like second date

15:20.717 --> 15:22.748
or like
way down the line later.

15:22.750 --> 15:25.215
- Do it.
- No way.

15:25.217 --> 15:26.215
Do it.

15:26.217 --> 15:28.015
Mm-mm, absolutely not.

15:28.017 --> 15:29.715
Do it, do it, do it,

15:29.717 --> 15:33.249
and I will give you
all of my fries.

15:33.251 --> 15:34.915
Every single one.

15:34.917 --> 15:38.182
You are very lucky
I like fries.

15:38.184 --> 15:39.848
Do it.

15:39.850 --> 15:41.284
Okay, but close your eyes.

15:47.717 --> 15:53.482
♪ There were nights
when the wind was so cold ♪

15:53.484 --> 15:56.149
♪ That my body froze in bed ♪

15:56.151 --> 15:59.415
♪ If I just listened to it ♪

15:59.417 --> 16:02.848
♪ Right outside my window ♪

16:02.850 --> 16:05.482
Oh, my God,
that's shockingly good.

16:05.484 --> 16:07.882
Your turn.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.015
I can't even think.
I'm so hard.

16:09.017 --> 16:10.382
Three things, come on.

16:10.384 --> 16:14.115
Okay, I am an artist,

16:14.117 --> 16:16.915
I'm from California,

16:16.917 --> 16:19.115
and...

16:19.117 --> 16:21.215
my family is weird.

16:21.217 --> 16:26.482
That's funny 'cause my family's
actually totally normal.

16:26.484 --> 16:28.215
Can I have a bite?

16:28.217 --> 16:30.317
Yeah, sure.

16:33.817 --> 16:35.315
Why didn't you just order one?

16:35.317 --> 16:37.349
I was trying to be ladylike.

16:37.351 --> 16:38.715
Come on.

16:38.717 --> 16:40.317
It's so good.

16:43.817 --> 16:47.184
That guy is totally
checking you out.

16:49.351 --> 16:51.815
Yeah, he's cute.

16:51.817 --> 16:53.349
Oh!

16:53.351 --> 16:54.781
You're gay.

16:54.783 --> 16:57.315
No, I'm just not
totally straight.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.282
So you're bisexual.

16:59.284 --> 17:01.415
If you're into labels.

17:01.417 --> 17:05.082
But you're attracted to men.

17:05.084 --> 17:07.217
I'm attracted to you.

17:11.251 --> 17:13.182
You said I could
have your fries.

17:13.184 --> 17:14.348
Absolutely every single one.

17:14.351 --> 17:16.115
So you can have
this rabbit food.

17:16.117 --> 17:17.815
All for me?
I'm gonna eat your fries.

17:17.817 --> 17:19.714
It's delicious.

17:19.717 --> 17:21.982
It's a great neighborhood.

17:21.983 --> 17:23.217
I like it.

17:25.217 --> 17:27.315
How many more blocks?

17:27.317 --> 17:30.182
Why do you wear heels like that?
You cripple your feet.

17:30.184 --> 17:31.715
Take them off.

17:31.717 --> 17:32.781
And walk barefoot?

17:32.783 --> 17:34.015
Yeah.

17:34.017 --> 17:35.149
I'll get foot cancer.

17:35.151 --> 17:36.982
Okay, piggyback.

17:36.984 --> 17:38.781
- Really?
- Hop on, yeah.

17:38.783 --> 17:43.781
Okay.

17:43.783 --> 17:45.015
- Only 10...
- This is great.

17:45.017 --> 17:47.817
Ten more blocks.

17:56.783 --> 17:58.215
Is this where you work?

17:58.217 --> 17:59.750
And sleep.

18:04.017 --> 18:06.015
Okay, what do you think of this?

18:06.017 --> 18:08.048
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I don't know anything about art.

18:08.050 --> 18:09.715
No, no, that's great.
What would your gut say?

18:09.717 --> 18:11.482
It looks like a kindergarten
class project.

18:11.484 --> 18:14.715
Okay, I really felt like
it was made by an adult.

18:14.717 --> 18:17.715
No. You know, I really think
it was made by little hands.

18:17.717 --> 18:19.382
I was going for
postmodern irony.

18:19.384 --> 18:21.815
- Oh, you're the kindergartner.
- I'm the kindergartner.

18:21.817 --> 18:25.282
What I meant to say is it looks
like it was made by a genius.

18:25.284 --> 18:27.948
- Genius.
- Who is acutely in touch...

18:27.950 --> 18:29.781
- With inner child.
- With his inner child.

18:29.783 --> 18:31.882
Yeah, it's cool.
It's just my life's work.

18:31.884 --> 18:34.048
- Come up here.
- No, thanks.

18:34.050 --> 18:35.715
You have to see this one
from up here.

18:35.717 --> 18:37.249
Can you just take a picture
and then send it to me?

18:37.251 --> 18:38.184
It's safe.

18:40.084 --> 18:41.715
Come on.

18:41.717 --> 18:46.182
Ooh! This does not feel stable.

18:46.184 --> 18:48.415
It's as stable
as my parents' marriage.

18:48.417 --> 18:49.750
Great.

18:51.484 --> 18:53.115
Come here. You see it?

18:53.117 --> 18:54.249
Yeah.

18:54.251 --> 18:56.015
Open your eyes.

18:58.351 --> 19:00.115
I got you, I got you.
You see it?

19:00.117 --> 19:04.215
Okay, so the objects represent
how thin and deflating

19:04.217 --> 19:05.482
traditional notions
of masculinity are,

19:05.484 --> 19:07.182
and the sports themselves,

19:07.184 --> 19:09.415
they show us
the unnecessary aggression

19:09.417 --> 19:12.015
with which man seeks to dominate
everything that he does.

19:12.017 --> 19:13.650
And then the baseball...

19:16.984 --> 19:19.449
Thanks for making
the first move.

19:19.451 --> 19:21.084
You're welcome.

19:40.284 --> 19:42.149
You're kinda taking
advantage of me.

19:42.151 --> 19:43.382
I don't even know
your last name.

19:43.384 --> 19:46.715
- It's Husseini.
- Husseini?

19:46.717 --> 19:48.315
Yeah, like Saddam Hussein.

19:48.317 --> 19:50.748
Oh, that's hot.
You're like a dictator.

19:50.750 --> 19:53.449
Well, in high school,

19:53.451 --> 19:55.182
they actually called me
Saddam Hussein

19:55.184 --> 19:57.482
because I had a unibrow.

19:57.484 --> 19:59.449
That's so cruel.

19:59.451 --> 20:01.948
You wanna know what they
called me in high school?

20:01.950 --> 20:03.884
Andy Warhol queer boy.

20:05.317 --> 20:08.115
That's actually
kinda accurate.

20:08.117 --> 20:10.917
You know what? You are
kinda like Saddam Hussein.

20:18.084 --> 20:19.915
What time is it?

20:19.917 --> 20:21.349
10:30.

20:21.351 --> 20:24.182
See? She gives a whole new
meaning to CP time.

20:24.184 --> 20:25.315
I don't know what that is.

20:25.317 --> 20:27.982
Colored people time.

20:27.984 --> 20:30.082
I don't think I'm allowed
to use that expression.

20:30.084 --> 20:32.683
- Well!
- There she is.

20:34.917 --> 20:36.915
- How did it go?
- Amazing, incredible.

20:36.917 --> 20:39.115
He's the greatest person
that's ever lived. I love him.

20:39.117 --> 20:40.982
So it went well.

20:40.984 --> 20:43.249
Yes, but...

20:43.251 --> 20:45.382
Oh, already she's starting
to pick him apart.

20:45.384 --> 20:47.781
- He's just...
- Not Persian. He's not Persian.

20:47.783 --> 20:50.048
He's never gonna fit
into my family.

20:50.050 --> 20:52.848
He's this free-spirited artist
who's funny and gentle

20:52.850 --> 20:54.182
and sensitive and progressive,

20:54.184 --> 20:55.915
and I'm from
a family of fascists

20:55.917 --> 20:57.415
who are gonna Mussolini him
outta my life

20:57.417 --> 20:58.748
if they ever meet him.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.282
Whoa, girl, slow down.

21:00.284 --> 21:01.415
You didn't tell him
all that, did you?

21:01.417 --> 21:02.815
Not exactly.

21:02.817 --> 21:04.848
- He's also bisexual.
- Huh.

21:04.850 --> 21:06.415
It's not a big deal.

21:06.417 --> 21:08.215
No. I mean Tessa's bi.

21:08.217 --> 21:09.915
I used to get really jealous
when men would look at her,

21:09.917 --> 21:11.449
but then my therapist
helped me realize

21:11.451 --> 21:13.249
that I'm not replaceable.

21:13.251 --> 21:15.982
- No, you're not.
- I'm bi for David Beckham.

21:17.850 --> 21:19.415
What?

21:19.417 --> 21:21.182
I'm going to work.

21:21.184 --> 21:23.650
You're so confusing.

21:25.417 --> 21:30.017
- You don't look it.
- "Gay for David Beckham."

21:33.417 --> 21:35.282
Thank you.

21:35.284 --> 21:37.115
Thank you.

21:37.117 --> 21:40.848
So who's your favorite
family member?

21:40.850 --> 21:42.315
I don't really have one.

21:42.317 --> 21:46.282
Come on, white man,
you gotta love someone.

21:46.284 --> 21:50.149
Steven, my dad's husband.

21:50.151 --> 21:52.282
Oh.

21:52.284 --> 21:54.382
- So your parents...
- Are divorced.

21:54.384 --> 21:57.848
- Huh.
- And my dad met a great guy.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.948
What was that like?

21:59.950 --> 22:02.215
Pretty fucked up.
How 'bout you?

22:02.217 --> 22:04.249
- My grandma.
- Okay.

22:04.251 --> 22:07.382
- She's my whole world.
- Aww.

22:07.384 --> 22:09.982
My mom's gonna wanna drink
a bottle of the best tequila

22:09.984 --> 22:11.982
with you until you have
to put her to bed.

22:11.984 --> 22:13.781
That's amazing.

22:13.783 --> 22:15.315
My mom's gonna wanna make
you feel super inadequate

22:15.317 --> 22:17.315
in everything that you do
or will ever do.

22:17.317 --> 22:18.748
She sounds great.

22:18.750 --> 22:22.215
Fair warning,
my family is kinda nuts.

22:22.217 --> 22:23.848
My family's nuts too,

22:23.850 --> 22:25.948
but in an entirely
different way.

22:25.950 --> 22:27.449
I mean,
we had to stick together

22:27.451 --> 22:30.815
to make it through war
and immigration.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.982
We're kinda like a tribe.

22:32.984 --> 22:34.848
That's cool.

22:34.850 --> 22:37.249
I've never felt like
part of a tribe.

22:37.251 --> 22:39.650
It can be stifling.

22:41.884 --> 22:43.982
We can be a tribe.

22:43.984 --> 22:45.982
I will happily stifle you.

22:45.984 --> 22:48.848
I wanna be part of your tribe
and be stifled.

22:52.184 --> 22:53.781
What is it
that you do exactly?

22:53.783 --> 22:55.349
I'm a housing attorney.

22:55.351 --> 22:58.182
I litigate for low-income
tenants against big developers,

22:58.184 --> 23:01.982
mostly hang out in this office
or in conference rooms.

23:01.984 --> 23:03.815
Hey, Alex,
great to see you again.

23:03.817 --> 23:04.948
We met at the rally.

23:04.950 --> 23:06.915
- Hi.
- Hey, I'm Doris.

23:06.917 --> 23:07.915
Nice to meet you.

23:07.917 --> 23:09.249
- Pleasure.
- 'Sup!

23:09.251 --> 23:12.748
Not much, bro.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.149
These are my coworkers.

23:14.151 --> 23:16.048
- Bye, guys.
- Okay, bye.

23:16.050 --> 23:17.215
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

23:17.217 --> 23:18.715
- Bye.
- Bye.

23:18.717 --> 23:21.282
- Short and sweet.
- Bye.

23:21.284 --> 23:23.249
Bye.

23:23.251 --> 23:24.848
Do you wanna go
literally anywhere else?

23:24.850 --> 23:26.884
- Sure, yeah.
- Anywhere else.

23:29.717 --> 23:32.482
This is as exciting as it gets.

23:32.484 --> 23:36.715
Are you kidding?
Your job's so cool.

23:36.717 --> 23:39.415
Have I ever told you that
I always wanted to be an actor?

23:39.417 --> 23:41.415
- Actor?
- Mm-hmm.

23:41.417 --> 23:45.781
But my parents were immigrants,
and I couldn't do that to them.

23:45.783 --> 23:51.715
You know, you actually look
amazing in this light.

23:51.717 --> 23:53.815
Can we make out here?

23:53.817 --> 23:57.149
Yes, but I don't want
the judge to see it.

23:57.151 --> 24:00.084
I laugh in the face of danger.

24:05.151 --> 24:07.182
Your job's so much cooler
than mine.

24:07.184 --> 24:08.950
- You think so?
- Yeah.

24:10.017 --> 24:11.781
Pretty dead though.

24:11.783 --> 24:14.982
It's a quiet night.
Means we can play what we want.

24:14.984 --> 24:16.815
So what's your
signature dance move?

24:16.817 --> 24:19.249
I can only dance
to Persian music.

24:19.251 --> 24:21.182
Eastern beats.

24:21.184 --> 24:23.882
You got it.
Floor's yours.

24:23.884 --> 24:26.115
- No.
- Come on.

24:28.817 --> 24:29.884
- All right.
- Go on.

24:32.050 --> 24:34.048
First, you take your basket,

24:34.050 --> 24:37.781
and you plant
your seeds, okay?

24:37.783 --> 24:39.482
- And then you take your hose...
- My hose?

24:39.484 --> 24:41.449
- And you water your seed.
- Oh, I like that.

24:41.451 --> 24:43.982
You water your seed.
All about the heat.

24:43.984 --> 24:45.748
And then you feed
your seed to grow.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.882
- That's sexy.
- Feed your seed to grow.

24:47.884 --> 24:50.349
And now your trees have bloomed,

24:50.351 --> 24:53.149
and you must harvest
the fruit, okay?

25:01.484 --> 25:03.449
- Okay.
- Thank you.

25:03.451 --> 25:05.384
- Serious question.
- Hmm.

25:06.917 --> 25:09.449
Have you told
your parents about me?

25:09.451 --> 25:11.115
Why would I ever do that?

25:11.117 --> 25:12.781
Because I told my parents
about you.

25:12.783 --> 25:15.948
- No, you haven't.
- Yeah, I have.

25:15.950 --> 25:17.715
What'd you tell 'em?

25:17.717 --> 25:20.215
I told them I met
this really rad girl.

25:20.217 --> 25:21.948
Why haven't you told
your mom about me?

25:21.950 --> 25:24.415
Don't you talk to her
like 21 times a day?

25:24.417 --> 25:27.015
- Are you ashamed of me?
- No.

25:27.017 --> 25:29.115
You're ashamed of me.

25:29.117 --> 25:31.315
- They're just...
- Gimme that.

25:31.317 --> 25:33.315
They're just really
into our culture.

25:33.317 --> 25:36.115
I have to ease them into this.

25:36.117 --> 25:38.115
I made something for you.

25:38.117 --> 25:39.781
- What?
- Come see.

25:39.783 --> 25:41.249
I'm way too high
to walk right now.

25:41.251 --> 25:43.683
Come on, take the chips.

25:47.850 --> 25:49.415
Wow.

25:49.417 --> 25:52.082
That is some romantic shit.

25:52.084 --> 25:54.449
It's Saddam Hussein
and Andy Warhol kissing.

25:54.451 --> 25:56.048
I noticed.

25:57.284 --> 26:00.115
- Hey.
- Mm.

26:00.117 --> 26:02.050
Let's move in together.

26:03.884 --> 26:06.115
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:06.117 --> 26:09.182
- For real?
- Yup.

26:09.184 --> 26:10.748
It's not too soon?

26:10.750 --> 26:11.884
No.

26:13.351 --> 26:15.449
Let's do it.

26:15.451 --> 26:18.082
But we can't live here.

26:18.084 --> 26:19.115
Why?

26:19.117 --> 26:22.315
Your bathroom's outside.

26:28.151 --> 26:31.449
Would you feel oppressed
if I asked you to do the dishes?

26:31.451 --> 26:34.783
Yes, I would feel
very oppressed.

26:39.717 --> 26:41.015
Would you feel oppressed

26:41.017 --> 26:42.781
if I asked you
to take out the garbage?

26:42.783 --> 26:47.715
Super-oppressive.
Wouldn't be able to handle it.

26:47.717 --> 26:49.084
Thought so.

26:54.717 --> 26:57.415
What if I locked you up,

26:57.417 --> 26:59.117
tied you to the bed
and impregnated you?

27:00.984 --> 27:03.217
That wouldn't be so bad.
I can do that.

27:08.351 --> 27:09.449
I love you.

27:09.451 --> 27:10.850
I love you.

27:30.884 --> 27:34.315
- Let's do it again.
- We already did it twice.

27:34.317 --> 27:37.349
Should I sing the song?

27:37.351 --> 27:38.382
Yes.

27:38.384 --> 27:40.415
Wig or no wig?

27:40.417 --> 27:42.282
With the wig.

27:42.284 --> 27:46.384
♪ Whispers in the morning ♪

27:51.050 --> 27:52.449
- Oh, it's my mom.
- Oh, okay.

27:52.451 --> 27:54.215
- No, I have to get it.
- No, stay down here.

27:54.217 --> 27:56.015
I didn't answer the first.
She'll freak out.

27:56.017 --> 27:58.315
Are you kidding?

27:58.317 --> 28:00.048
- Video?
- Please hide, please.

28:00.050 --> 28:01.415
Hide where?

28:01.417 --> 28:02.982
Hi, Mom.

28:02.984 --> 28:04.915
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hi.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.915
- <i>Can you see me?</i>
- Yup, I see you, Mom.

28:06.917 --> 28:09.982
<i>Good. Now, do you
remember Fariba?</i>

28:09.984 --> 28:12.048
- Uh-huh.
- <i>Do you remember her son?</i>

28:12.050 --> 28:15.915
- Yeah, sure.
- <i>He has invited you to dinner.</i>

28:15.917 --> 28:18.149
<i>What's that?
Is that a naked man?</i>

28:18.151 --> 28:20.349
- Babe!
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

28:20.351 --> 28:22.882
- Oh, did she see me?
- <i>Is he naked?</i>

28:22.884 --> 28:25.848
<i>What's a naked man
doing in your room?</i>

28:25.850 --> 28:27.882
At least now she knows.

28:27.884 --> 28:29.850
<i>Nousha! Nousha!</i>

28:31.850 --> 28:34.650
I'm so excited
to finally meet your family.

28:36.384 --> 28:39.282
Just don't say anything.

28:39.284 --> 28:43.048
You know, like if they
ask you something, eat.

28:43.050 --> 28:45.048
- I have to reply.
- No, you don't.

28:45.050 --> 28:48.282
No, just put something
in your mouth and chew.

28:48.284 --> 28:51.084
You got this.
We got this.

29:05.050 --> 29:06.415
This is amazing.

29:06.417 --> 29:08.382
Thank you so much
for having me over.

29:08.384 --> 29:10.215
Of course.

29:10.217 --> 29:12.915
You're so welcome.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.984
So far, so good.

29:16.850 --> 29:19.982
Nousha tells us
you're a musical engineer.

29:19.984 --> 29:21.783
Did she?

29:23.750 --> 29:26.382
Yeah, kinda.

29:26.384 --> 29:29.950
Actually, I'm engineer too.

29:31.817 --> 29:34.048
- Really?
- Civil engineer.

29:34.050 --> 29:35.315
Cool.

29:35.317 --> 29:36.781
Did you go to Harvard?

29:36.783 --> 29:39.848
Mother, not everyone
goes to Harvard.

29:39.850 --> 29:41.182
Oxford?

29:41.184 --> 29:43.349
No, wait, LSE,

29:43.351 --> 29:44.482
the London School of Economics.

29:44.484 --> 29:47.249
Nope, none of the above.

29:47.251 --> 29:48.650
Princeton?

29:57.417 --> 30:00.815
You know, I'm sorry,
I didn't go to Harvard,

30:00.817 --> 30:03.748
and I'm not an engineer.

30:03.750 --> 30:07.482
Um, I went to
Goddard College in Vermont.

30:07.484 --> 30:09.249
No?

30:09.251 --> 30:11.282
Okay.

30:11.284 --> 30:14.382
I'm an artist,
and a I'm a deejay,

30:14.384 --> 30:17.715
and I love your daughter
very much.

30:17.717 --> 30:21.781
In fact,
the best part of my day

30:21.783 --> 30:23.384
is waking up together.

30:25.783 --> 30:28.384
Excuse me? Um...

30:29.984 --> 30:34.282
What do you mean,
waking up together?

30:34.284 --> 30:37.884
You mean you are
living together?

30:42.884 --> 30:45.349
Mm.

30:45.351 --> 30:47.050
So good.

30:49.317 --> 30:52.650
I need some fresh air.

31:02.351 --> 31:04.315
Can I talk to you
for a second?

31:04.317 --> 31:06.249
How could you not tell them
anything about me?

31:06.251 --> 31:08.015
I don't know.
It never came up.

31:08.017 --> 31:10.748
That's insane. How could you
put me in that position?

31:10.750 --> 31:11.982
I wanted to hold off
putting you through this

31:11.984 --> 31:13.449
for as long as possible.

31:13.451 --> 31:15.282
- What do you mean?
- Let me break it down for you.

31:15.284 --> 31:18.182
First, my dad is going to
get angry and brokenhearted,

31:18.184 --> 31:21.182
and then my mom is going to try
to pressure us to get married,

31:21.184 --> 31:23.282
and when we say no,
she's going to freak out

31:23.284 --> 31:24.482
because I'm her only chance

31:24.484 --> 31:26.048
at throwing a lavish
Persian wedding

31:26.050 --> 31:27.882
in front of all of
her family and friends.

31:27.884 --> 31:30.882
- Oh, Christ.
- Look, just stay strong.

31:30.884 --> 31:32.848
Okay? Don't give in.

31:32.850 --> 31:34.249
- Drink your tea.
- Drink my tea.

31:34.251 --> 31:35.415
- Drink your tea.
- Drink my tea.

31:35.417 --> 31:37.882
- Drink your tea.
- Drink my tea.

31:37.884 --> 31:40.715
So you are
living together?

31:40.717 --> 31:42.182
Then you need to get married.

31:42.184 --> 31:44.415
We wanna try
just living together first.

31:44.417 --> 31:47.781
If you want to live together,
you have to first get married.

31:47.783 --> 31:49.482
She's so right.

31:49.484 --> 31:51.215
We need more time.

31:51.217 --> 31:54.015
We're still getting
to know each other.

32:00.850 --> 32:03.482
If you really
get to know each other,

32:03.484 --> 32:05.415
you'll never get married.
Never.

32:05.417 --> 32:08.249
I knew your father
for one day only.

32:08.251 --> 32:11.082
You get to know each other
after the wedding.

32:11.084 --> 32:12.282
Wedding?

32:12.284 --> 32:15.215
Yes, wedding.

32:15.217 --> 32:17.449
That's how people marry.
They have weddings.

32:17.451 --> 32:20.815
We don't want to get married.

32:20.817 --> 32:23.349
And even if we did,
we don't want a wedding.

32:23.351 --> 32:24.882
Why not?

32:24.884 --> 32:28.748
No wedding, no marriage,
no living together.

32:28.750 --> 32:30.249
It's a package, you see?

32:30.251 --> 32:33.115
What about if we registered
as domestic partners?

32:33.117 --> 32:34.781
What is a domestic partner?

32:34.783 --> 32:36.848
It's an alternative
for those who want

32:36.850 --> 32:39.149
the protection and the benefits
of a partnership,

32:39.151 --> 32:42.715
but don't wanna enter into
the institution of marriage.

32:42.717 --> 32:44.449
Marriage is not an institution.

32:44.451 --> 32:46.315
Marriage is marriage.

32:46.317 --> 32:48.215
People marry to have baby.

32:48.217 --> 32:49.982
- Babies.
- Babies.

32:49.984 --> 32:51.182
- That is so...
- Oppressive.

32:51.184 --> 32:52.182
Thank you.

33:00.484 --> 33:02.848
Mamani, you're not gonna die.

33:02.850 --> 33:05.082
- Oh, yes, I will.
- She might.

33:05.084 --> 33:08.048
Actually, Ziba,
it's time for my shot.

33:08.050 --> 33:09.715
Oh, of course.

33:09.717 --> 33:12.717
I'm so sorry, Mamani.
I'm coming.

33:15.117 --> 33:16.882
Reza.

33:16.884 --> 33:18.282
Alex.

33:18.284 --> 33:19.217
Oh, yeah.

33:25.884 --> 33:27.284
It's done.

33:29.417 --> 33:31.948
I promise you,
we're gonna keep it simple.

33:31.950 --> 33:34.015
Something small
in the backyard.

33:34.017 --> 33:35.715
We can do it next month,

33:35.717 --> 33:37.482
when your uncle visits
from Iran.

33:37.484 --> 33:39.282
- Next month?
- Yes.

33:39.284 --> 33:41.349
If they ever let him
in this country,

33:41.351 --> 33:43.082
he can only stay for 10 days.

33:43.084 --> 33:45.349
Don't you wanna do it
for Mamani?

33:45.351 --> 33:47.015
She's been so sad
since Baba died.

33:47.017 --> 33:51.017
Mommy, Baba died 25 years ago.

33:53.017 --> 33:54.948
- Alex.
- Sir?

33:54.950 --> 33:57.750
Don't you wanna
marry my daughter?

34:02.084 --> 34:03.282
Of course.

34:03.284 --> 34:04.315
Done!

34:04.317 --> 34:06.382
I'm calling everyone.

34:06.384 --> 34:09.114
- Oh, my God!
- Congratulations!

34:09.117 --> 34:10.982
Welcome
to the family, Alex.

34:10.984 --> 34:12.217
Here's to the family.

34:13.284 --> 34:15.248
Sweetheart, congratulations.

34:15.251 --> 34:17.050
Oh, congratulations.

34:21.016 --> 34:23.248
Congratulations.

34:23.251 --> 34:24.650
Thank you.

34:29.117 --> 34:31.351
What just happened?

34:33.050 --> 34:35.217
I don't know.

34:37.884 --> 34:41.014
You were supposed to
just drink your tea.

34:41.016 --> 34:43.251
They were so convincing.

34:47.949 --> 34:49.884
Do I propose or do you?

35:15.817 --> 35:17.382
It's so great
that you're all here,

35:17.384 --> 35:18.815
and we're all together.

35:18.817 --> 35:20.082
It's really awesome.

35:20.084 --> 35:22.282
We've heard so much
about you guys.

35:22.284 --> 35:25.048
I'm so happy to finally
meet all of you.

35:25.050 --> 35:26.482
No, we're the happy ones.

35:26.484 --> 35:28.748
Your daughter is
absolutely lovely.

35:28.750 --> 35:29.882
I agree!

35:31.117 --> 35:33.182
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

35:33.184 --> 35:35.215
Cheers.

35:35.217 --> 35:37.284
What is that?
That's lovely.

35:40.251 --> 35:42.115
That's a poem

35:42.117 --> 35:45.982
by the 14th century
Persian poet, Hafez.

35:45.984 --> 35:47.948
Greatest poet of all time.

35:47.950 --> 35:51.317
It says...

35:54.417 --> 35:56.781
"Long live love,

35:56.783 --> 36:01.115
for I have not heard
a more merrier word than love."

36:01.117 --> 36:03.482
- That's beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

36:03.484 --> 36:05.882
I had a friend from Riyadh once,

36:05.884 --> 36:08.982
and it's such a pity how
complicated it is over there.

36:08.984 --> 36:12.249
Oh, with all due respect,
actually we are not from Riyadh.

36:12.251 --> 36:14.282
We are from Tehran.

36:14.284 --> 36:16.315
Oh, right.

36:16.317 --> 36:17.915
And just so you know,

36:17.917 --> 36:22.048
no region with oil
will have peace.

36:22.050 --> 36:26.182
And our stellar foreign policy
doesn't help either.

36:26.184 --> 36:29.149
Oh, well you're such
a political expert, Steven,

36:29.151 --> 36:32.282
that the next time you go
to the Middle East...

36:32.284 --> 36:34.382
and you may not come back
because we know what they do

36:34.384 --> 36:37.781
to people like you over there...

36:37.783 --> 36:39.082
well, I wouldn't care so much.

36:39.084 --> 36:40.449
Go, Team Talbot.

36:40.451 --> 36:42.748
Mamani, could you
pass the baklava?

36:42.750 --> 36:43.948
Thank you so much.

36:43.950 --> 36:46.948
How old was Alex
when you divorced?

36:46.950 --> 36:51.149
When we split, Alex was 16.

36:51.151 --> 36:52.950
Oh.

36:54.850 --> 36:57.449
And when did you
get remarried to...

36:57.451 --> 36:59.848
- Steven.
- I'm Steven.

36:59.850 --> 37:01.249
Not long after.

37:01.251 --> 37:02.848
Right.

37:02.850 --> 37:05.915
How soon after?

37:05.917 --> 37:09.282
I mean, did you meet Steven
and realized you were gay,

37:09.284 --> 37:12.915
then get separated and get
together with him and marry him,

37:12.917 --> 37:15.048
or were you feeling
unfulfilled with Maggie

37:15.050 --> 37:16.882
and get separated
and get to meet him

37:16.884 --> 37:19.349
and then you realize
you were gay?

37:19.351 --> 37:20.948
Wow.

37:20.950 --> 37:22.882
Mom, doesn't matter.

37:22.884 --> 37:26.748
I'm just trying to understand
how it all happens in general.

37:26.750 --> 37:29.315
There was overlap.

37:29.317 --> 37:30.882
But you knew.

37:30.884 --> 37:33.149
I mean, as a woman,
you must have known.

37:33.151 --> 37:36.315
And also, were you friends
with Steven

37:36.317 --> 37:39.882
when your husband met him,

37:39.884 --> 37:43.349
or you became friends
afterwards?

37:43.351 --> 37:44.650
Papa...

37:47.817 --> 37:50.050
I was never his friend.

37:51.384 --> 37:53.284
Excuse me.

37:54.817 --> 37:55.850
I'm sorry.

38:02.284 --> 38:03.217
I'll go.

38:07.384 --> 38:09.349
Maggie?

38:09.351 --> 38:10.948
I'm sorry.

38:10.950 --> 38:13.115
My mom can be a little pushy.

38:13.117 --> 38:15.848
They're just not used
to all this.

38:15.850 --> 38:17.182
It's not your fault.

38:17.184 --> 38:19.948
It's everything.
It's my life.

38:19.950 --> 38:23.149
I never imagined I'd be single
at my son's wedding.

38:23.151 --> 38:25.251
Well, you're doing great.

38:27.384 --> 38:29.815
I'm coming in.

38:29.817 --> 38:31.817
Ohh...

38:40.884 --> 38:43.115
I'm so alone.

38:43.117 --> 38:46.084
No, you're not.
You have us now.

38:47.484 --> 38:51.182
I wasted my youth
on a homosexual.

38:51.184 --> 38:52.982
Yeah, but that was the past.

38:52.984 --> 38:56.715
You still have your whole
future ahead of you.

38:56.717 --> 38:59.251
I'll never find true love.

39:01.084 --> 39:03.848
You know what Hafez says:

39:03.850 --> 39:07.449
"Love finds you
when you least expect it."

39:10.884 --> 39:12.882
How's it going out there?

39:12.884 --> 39:15.715
Well, Ziba's getting Steven

39:15.717 --> 39:17.349
the chandelier tour
of the house,

39:17.351 --> 39:21.015
and our fathers are debating
whether or not sodomy is a sin.

39:21.017 --> 39:23.249
Oh, God.

39:23.251 --> 39:26.417
Well, little do they know
we are already in hell.

39:31.817 --> 39:33.082
- Hairbrush.
- Check.

39:33.084 --> 39:34.882
- Computer.
- Check.

39:34.884 --> 39:36.282
- Toothbrush.
- Check.

39:36.284 --> 39:37.748
What do you think?

39:37.750 --> 39:39.848
Oh, I think that
looks like ice cream.

39:39.850 --> 39:41.249
- It's really bad, isn't it?
- Yeah.

39:41.251 --> 39:43.315
- When did she get that for you?
- When I was 12.

39:43.317 --> 39:44.415
- Oh, baby.
- Please hold me.

39:44.417 --> 39:45.917
I'll hold you.

39:47.251 --> 39:49.184
All right, we gotta go.
We gotta go.

39:52.017 --> 39:55.382
Okay, so Uncle Saman
is going to take my room.

39:55.384 --> 39:57.249
I am going
to be on the couch.

39:57.251 --> 39:58.817
You are going to be
in the guest room.

40:00.984 --> 40:03.115
You need to hire help.

40:03.117 --> 40:05.215
I don't need any help.

40:05.217 --> 40:07.715
Why would I pay someone
when I could do it myself?

40:07.717 --> 40:09.015
I'm an engineer.

40:09.017 --> 40:10.815
Dad?

40:10.817 --> 40:13.215
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

40:13.217 --> 40:15.082
Whatcha doin'?

40:15.084 --> 40:18.115
I'm building
a Persepolis fountain.

40:18.117 --> 40:22.748
It is going to look exactly
like the Persian ancient ruins.

40:22.750 --> 40:27.215
580 BC, Cyrus the Great.

40:27.217 --> 40:29.848
Oh, boy.

40:29.850 --> 40:32.282
Your mother has invited
half of Orange County.

40:32.284 --> 40:33.982
I have a reputation.

40:33.984 --> 40:36.748
Alex, could you kindly
give me that, please?

40:36.750 --> 40:38.217
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

40:40.117 --> 40:42.149
Why is she so nervous?

40:42.151 --> 40:44.748
It's gonna look good.
I promise you.

40:44.750 --> 40:46.748
Just imagine Persepolis, right?

40:46.750 --> 40:50.315
Okay, we have four columns:
two big ones, two shorter ones.

40:50.317 --> 40:53.848
One big one over here,
one soldier's guarding it.

40:53.850 --> 40:57.715
Another big one over here,
another soldier's guarding it.

40:57.717 --> 41:00.249
And two shorter columns
here and there.

41:00.251 --> 41:03.048
And also you got
two fountains:

41:03.050 --> 41:06.082
one seven inch,
one five inch,

41:06.084 --> 41:10.781
each with their own engines,
and then we light it up.

41:10.783 --> 41:12.115
That's cool.

41:12.117 --> 41:13.915
It's gonna look spectacular.

41:13.917 --> 41:16.015
Thank you, Dad.

41:16.017 --> 41:17.384
Now go see your uncle.
I'm busy.

41:18.451 --> 41:20.948
Good luck.

41:20.950 --> 41:22.783
- Oh, okay.
- Toodles.

41:45.151 --> 41:47.115
This is my fiance Alex.

41:50.950 --> 41:53.783
Oh, well, it's nice
to meet you too.

41:56.284 --> 41:58.017
No.

41:59.783 --> 42:02.082
- What was that?
- He said he's...

42:02.084 --> 42:05.115
really happy to meet you.

42:05.117 --> 42:07.650
Alex, congratulation.
I hear you're a doctor.

42:08.917 --> 42:10.282
He's actually, a...

42:10.284 --> 42:11.482
- He's an artist.
- Artist.

42:11.484 --> 42:13.215
Yeah, he makes art
out of balloons.

42:13.217 --> 42:15.050
- Oh.
- Yeah.

42:16.351 --> 42:18.115
I didn't follow that.

42:18.117 --> 42:20.415
He's really excited
to meet your family, he said.

42:20.417 --> 42:22.482
- I'm so excited.
- Very excited.

42:22.484 --> 42:24.215
- So excited.
- Very excited.

42:24.217 --> 42:26.449
- So excited.
- So excited.

42:26.451 --> 42:28.815
Really exciting.

42:28.817 --> 42:30.282
Oh, look!

42:30.284 --> 42:32.182
Bougainvilleas
and pulmonarias.

42:32.184 --> 42:33.415
Oh, for God's sake.

42:33.417 --> 42:35.882
I used to plant those
with Mom!

42:35.884 --> 42:38.282
Would you please just
butch it up a little bit?

42:38.284 --> 42:41.015
- These are Muslims.
- Oh!

42:41.017 --> 42:43.715
- Here comes the wrecking ball.
- Oh, come on.

42:43.717 --> 42:45.048
- Where are you going?
- I have to help her.

42:45.050 --> 42:46.815
Oh, the drama queen
makes an entrance.

42:46.817 --> 42:48.848
Are you gonna be like this
all weekend?

42:48.850 --> 42:50.915
Why do you have to be such
a problem person all the time?

42:50.917 --> 42:53.082
You know what? Since you know
so much about fruit,

42:53.084 --> 42:54.415
why don't you help me
pick 'em up?

42:54.417 --> 42:55.449
Oh, zing, zing, zing!

42:55.451 --> 42:57.182
- Hey!
- Oh.

42:57.184 --> 42:59.282
- We're in the back.
- All right.

42:59.284 --> 43:01.650
- We're not gonna help.
- We're not gonna help.

43:07.484 --> 43:10.449
Sweetheart, you come here.

43:10.451 --> 43:12.982
You stand right here.
Good, okay.

43:12.984 --> 43:14.948
- Maggie.
- Yes.

43:14.950 --> 43:17.482
Come, come, please.

43:17.484 --> 43:19.882
To the left.
Bill, to the right.

43:19.884 --> 43:21.915
- Here?
- Let me see.

43:21.917 --> 43:23.382
Perfect.

43:23.384 --> 43:25.082
The groom will walk first,

43:25.084 --> 43:27.382
presented by the mother
and the father.

43:27.384 --> 43:29.915
Actually, no.

43:29.917 --> 43:31.282
Come here.

43:31.284 --> 43:34.415
I really wanna walk down
the aisle with Steven.

43:34.417 --> 43:36.282
But Steven is not the mother.

43:36.284 --> 43:38.115
No, but he is my husband.

43:38.117 --> 43:39.915
It's gonna be complicated.

43:39.917 --> 43:41.948
Then who will she walk with?

43:41.950 --> 43:43.382
Does she even have to walk?

43:43.384 --> 43:45.249
Well, if it were up to you,
I'd be crawling.

43:45.251 --> 43:47.048
- What a good idea.
- You're not the mother.

43:47.050 --> 43:48.482
Please, please!
Guys, look.

43:48.484 --> 43:51.115
How about the three of you
walk together?

43:51.117 --> 43:54.115
Then four of them together,
walking down the aisle.

43:54.117 --> 43:56.815
It's going to look ridiculous.

43:56.817 --> 43:59.048
That's exactly
what I want this to be.

43:59.050 --> 44:01.781
There is no way my mother's
gonna let Steven walk.

44:01.783 --> 44:03.048
You have to talk
to your father.

44:03.050 --> 44:04.415
Why are you taking her side?

44:04.417 --> 44:05.815
Steven might not even care.

44:05.817 --> 44:08.315
My dad cares.
You heard him.

44:08.317 --> 44:10.015
It is 30 yards.

44:10.017 --> 44:11.750
Make it happen.

44:14.017 --> 44:16.048
Make it happen?

44:17.984 --> 44:22.982
Why doesn't she walk
with Saman, my brother?

44:22.984 --> 44:25.115
Saman!

44:25.117 --> 44:26.050
Saman.

44:28.151 --> 44:30.781
Talbots, this is
my little brother from Iran.

44:30.783 --> 44:33.781
Oh, hey, I'm Bill.
I'm Alex's dad.

44:33.783 --> 44:35.282
Oh, hi, I'm Saman.

44:35.284 --> 44:37.315
Oh, can I call you Sam?

44:37.317 --> 44:38.382
Saman.

44:38.384 --> 44:39.415
Saman.

44:39.417 --> 44:41.249
Steven. I'm his husband.

44:41.251 --> 44:43.382
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

44:43.384 --> 44:45.349
A visitor from the orient.

44:45.351 --> 44:46.415
I'm Maggie Baker.

44:46.417 --> 44:47.449
Hello, Maggie Baker.

44:47.451 --> 44:49.182
I am Saman.

44:49.184 --> 44:53.149
Perfect. So the two of you
will walk together first,

44:53.151 --> 44:55.382
and then Steven, Bill, Alex,

44:55.384 --> 44:59.349
and then me and Reza
and my daughter.

44:59.351 --> 45:01.282
- Are you okay with this?
- Absolutely. Compromise.

45:01.284 --> 45:02.415
Shall we, Maggie Baker?

45:02.417 --> 45:04.415
Yes, thank you, Saman.

45:04.417 --> 45:06.315
- Thank you.
- So what does Saman mean?

45:06.317 --> 45:09.715
Saman means, "One who climbs
the mountain for the life."

45:09.717 --> 45:12.048
- I love that!
- Yes.

45:12.050 --> 45:14.948
This is the traditional part
of the wedding.

45:34.717 --> 45:35.717
How beautiful.

45:39.317 --> 45:40.251
Kiss it.

45:43.317 --> 45:44.482
Cool.

45:44.484 --> 45:45.748
Am I Muslim now?

45:45.750 --> 45:46.781
No.

45:46.783 --> 45:48.082
Sort of.

45:48.084 --> 45:49.415
- Can I have a Muslim name?
- Sure.

45:49.417 --> 45:51.882
What would you like
your Muslim name to be?

45:51.884 --> 45:53.282
Uh...

45:53.284 --> 45:54.317
Mohammed?

45:57.117 --> 45:58.982
Okay, sure.

45:58.984 --> 46:00.249
Mohammed.

46:00.251 --> 46:02.249
Well, that was interesting.

46:02.251 --> 46:04.184
Are you serious?

46:08.451 --> 46:10.384
I'm getting a Quran.

46:14.484 --> 46:16.249
Hey, Saman.

46:16.251 --> 46:19.815
Oh, hey, Maggie Baker.

46:19.817 --> 46:21.282
I hope I didn't scare you.

46:21.284 --> 46:23.715
Oh, no, no.
I don't get scared.

46:23.717 --> 46:25.382
I've killed men
with my bare hands.

46:25.384 --> 46:27.182
Ooh.

46:27.184 --> 46:29.781
Well, I just came out
to have another drink

46:29.783 --> 46:31.382
before I hit the road,
you know?

46:31.384 --> 46:32.948
You don't drink, do you?

46:32.950 --> 46:35.115
- Sure, I do.
- You do?

46:35.117 --> 46:36.482
On special occasions.

46:36.484 --> 46:38.781
Well, I'd say this
is pretty special.

46:38.783 --> 46:39.781
Oh, yeah.

46:39.783 --> 46:41.817
Oh, thank you.

46:44.317 --> 46:46.251
Ooh, tequila.

46:49.251 --> 46:54.015
So why have you
not remarried?

46:54.017 --> 46:56.015
I just didn't wanna
make another mistake.

46:56.017 --> 46:57.815
And you? Divorced?

46:57.817 --> 47:00.882
Oh, no, no.
I've never been married.

47:00.884 --> 47:03.882
See, I have no gaydar.
I just...

47:03.884 --> 47:05.882
Oh, no, no, no, no.

47:05.884 --> 47:08.415
I just never found
the right woman.

47:08.417 --> 47:09.982
You're very funny.

47:09.984 --> 47:11.349
Oh, uh...

47:11.351 --> 47:14.151
Well, that's so sad.

47:16.950 --> 47:19.683
Yeah, I have no one
to go back to.

47:22.384 --> 47:25.748
Well, then maybe
you should stay here.

47:25.750 --> 47:27.117
Oh.

47:29.817 --> 47:31.351
Maybe I should.

47:38.117 --> 47:39.251
Sorry.

47:44.351 --> 47:46.249
- Okay.
- Sorry about that.

47:46.251 --> 47:47.650
Don't be sorry.

47:49.750 --> 47:51.382
Oh, thank you.

47:51.384 --> 47:53.848
Oh, my gosh.

47:53.850 --> 47:55.815
Don't you kiss twice
in your country?

47:55.817 --> 47:57.781
- Oh, yes, yes, you're right.
- It's like...

47:57.783 --> 47:59.282
- And mwah.
- Right, exactly.

47:59.284 --> 48:02.349
Wow. That was very unexpected.

48:02.351 --> 48:04.948
Like in America,
we just don't even bother.

48:04.950 --> 48:07.349
We just go straight
to the main kiss.

48:07.351 --> 48:09.848
Well, okay, then let's...

48:09.850 --> 48:12.748
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

48:12.750 --> 48:13.748
Maggie Baker.

48:16.783 --> 48:18.717
- Can I have another?
- Oh, sure.

49:07.384 --> 49:08.449
Ziba.

49:08.451 --> 49:10.282
Hi.

49:10.284 --> 49:12.382
I think we both should
relax a little bit.

49:12.384 --> 49:15.848
No. Our entire family,
all of our friends.

49:15.850 --> 49:19.149
How am I supposed to relax?
Half of Orange County is coming.

49:19.151 --> 49:20.482
Don't stress so much.

49:20.484 --> 49:22.815
It's gonna be all right.
I'm here.

49:22.817 --> 49:25.948
As it wasn't bad enough that
she's marrying a poor artist.

49:25.950 --> 49:27.249
Ziba.

49:27.251 --> 49:29.449
How is he going to
take care of her?

49:29.451 --> 49:34.115
He has no job.
How is he going to provide?

49:34.117 --> 49:36.748
And that family?
Oh, my God.

49:36.750 --> 49:38.715
Too late. They were already
living together.

49:38.717 --> 49:41.748
At least she's finally
getting married.

49:41.750 --> 49:43.082
Let's go to bed.

49:43.084 --> 49:45.149
What about the fountain?
Did you fix it?

49:45.151 --> 49:47.249
It's done. Almost done.

49:47.251 --> 49:49.715
I'm an engineer.

49:49.717 --> 49:51.182
Let's have a second honeymoon.

49:51.184 --> 49:53.482
- First, take a shower.
- Okay.

49:53.484 --> 49:55.848
It'd be even better
than our first one.

49:55.850 --> 49:57.683
Paris, 1975.

50:36.017 --> 50:38.015
Are you gonna leave me
one day?

50:38.017 --> 50:39.415
Why?

50:39.417 --> 50:41.015
Do you think our families
are too different?

50:41.017 --> 50:42.249
No.

50:42.251 --> 50:44.449
Is this all just
an experiment to you?

50:44.451 --> 50:48.048
Okay, I'm doing...

50:48.050 --> 50:50.415
all of this...

50:50.417 --> 50:52.415
because I love you.

50:52.417 --> 50:56.048
I just don't know if
you're taking it seriously.

50:56.050 --> 50:58.882
- I mean Mohammed, really?
- What? It's rad.

50:58.884 --> 51:00.282
I just don't think
you understand

51:00.284 --> 51:02.382
how serious marriage is
in my culture.

51:02.384 --> 51:04.182
It is forever.

51:04.184 --> 51:06.215
There is not one single divorce
in my family.

51:06.217 --> 51:08.482
Okay, I thought that I was
gonna become part of the tribe,

51:08.484 --> 51:10.149
and we'd be stifled
and oppressed together.

51:10.151 --> 51:12.215
Is that not what's happening?

51:12.217 --> 51:14.982
We've only known each other
for five months.

51:14.984 --> 51:17.015
Six, actually.

51:17.017 --> 51:19.349
We haven't even done
the 36 questions.

51:19.351 --> 51:21.149
I feel like we have done that.

51:21.151 --> 51:22.449
Oh, my God,
we don't know each other.

51:22.451 --> 51:24.048
Like more than once.

51:24.050 --> 51:25.282
What's my most treasured
childhood memory?

51:25.284 --> 51:27.182
- Spring break, senior year.
- Wrong.

51:27.184 --> 51:28.882
It's when I won the spelling bee
in third grade.

51:28.884 --> 51:31.948
- I did know that.
- We don't know each other.

51:31.950 --> 51:34.115
How are you gonna provide
for our children?

51:34.117 --> 51:36.249
What?

51:36.251 --> 51:38.082
Okay, wait,
where's this coming from?

51:38.084 --> 51:41.182
Is this you,
or is this Ziba?

51:41.184 --> 51:44.115
<i>10-4, 10-4.
Alex, can you hear me? Over.</i>

51:44.117 --> 51:46.315
I promised your uncle I'd help
fix these walkie-talkies

51:46.317 --> 51:48.151
before the wedding, and they're
still totally broken.

51:49.484 --> 51:51.115
Come here.

51:51.117 --> 51:53.781
Hey, hey, hey.

51:53.783 --> 51:57.115
We're gonna be fine, okay?

51:57.117 --> 51:59.449
Just 30 yards, right?

51:59.451 --> 52:00.715
I love you.

52:00.717 --> 52:02.182
<i>Alex, 10-4. Where are you?</i>

52:02.184 --> 52:03.915
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- <i>Can you hear me?</i>

52:03.917 --> 52:04.982
Yeah.

52:04.984 --> 52:06.082
See you tomorrow.

52:06.084 --> 52:07.151
Babe...

52:54.417 --> 52:56.415
Nousha, hold your breath.

52:57.417 --> 52:58.482
- Ouch.
- Ow!

52:58.484 --> 53:00.315
Shh!

53:02.817 --> 53:04.781
Hi, hi.

53:04.783 --> 53:06.748
Thank you so much.
I'm so happy to see you.

53:06.750 --> 53:08.215
Miss Iran 1975, hello.

53:08.217 --> 53:10.048
You look glamorous as always.

53:10.050 --> 53:13.182
Oh, stop it. You know,
it's still not too late for me

53:13.184 --> 53:14.382
to find you two husbands.

53:14.384 --> 53:15.948
Oh, that'll be great.

53:15.950 --> 53:17.884
Wow, that would be fantastic.

53:39.917 --> 53:42.982
<i>Saman...</i>

53:53.484 --> 53:55.115
There you are, sweetheart.
I can't even bend.

53:55.117 --> 53:56.948
It has a jacket.

53:56.950 --> 53:58.449
I think I'm having
a nervous breakdown.

53:58.451 --> 54:00.048
- No, no.
- No, really.

54:00.050 --> 54:01.882
There's all these people,
all this fuss.

54:01.884 --> 54:03.715
I look like it's my quinceanera.

54:03.717 --> 54:05.848
I don't know.
I don't know if I can do this.

54:05.850 --> 54:07.884
Honey, it's gonna be fine.

54:17.917 --> 54:19.915
I think you don't wanna talk
about the things that you did,

54:19.917 --> 54:22.149
but you're like
an Iranian general,

54:22.151 --> 54:23.848
and they can't talk about it.

54:23.850 --> 54:25.351
Thank you, Maggie.
You make me blush.

54:28.817 --> 54:31.082
Let's start wedding now.
Let's start wedding now!

54:31.084 --> 54:34.215
Saman, take over
and start wedding now!

54:34.217 --> 54:36.249
What?

54:36.251 --> 54:38.015
Cue the wedding song.

54:38.017 --> 54:39.149
Huh, what?

54:39.151 --> 54:41.382
Cue the wedding song!

54:41.384 --> 54:42.382
Oh, yes, yes.

54:42.384 --> 54:43.317
Music, music.

54:56.850 --> 54:59.149
Okay.

54:59.151 --> 55:02.950
They think that they'd have
high tech in the CIA in Iran.

55:06.850 --> 55:08.249
Oh, Nousha, it's time to go.

55:08.251 --> 55:09.982
I can't, Dad.
I need to talk to Alex.

55:09.984 --> 55:12.815
Alex is over there.
It's time to go, Nousha.

55:12.817 --> 55:13.848
Dad, wait.

55:13.850 --> 55:15.848
Just cold feet, honey.

55:15.850 --> 55:18.082
Everyone gets it, even me.

55:18.084 --> 55:20.982
I love her, she love me.

55:20.984 --> 55:22.748
Will she make me happy,

55:22.750 --> 55:24.482
or will she torture me
every day?

55:24.484 --> 55:28.781
Did I make her happy,
or did I fall into great misery?

55:28.783 --> 55:31.882
Would I be able to satisfy
her list of demands?

55:31.884 --> 55:33.917
Stop!

55:35.484 --> 55:36.882
I have to stop and think.

55:36.884 --> 55:38.048
You cannot stop, Nousha!

55:38.050 --> 55:41.215
Dad, I'm not ready.

55:41.217 --> 55:43.815
I don't know
if I can do this, okay?

55:43.817 --> 55:45.182
The wedding machine
cannot be stopped.

55:45.184 --> 55:47.415
Is everything okay?
Nousha, are you okay?

55:47.417 --> 55:49.848
I can't marry him.

55:49.850 --> 55:51.182
She's okay, she's okay.

55:51.184 --> 55:52.182
Reza, let's take her inside.

55:52.184 --> 55:53.482
No, no, no!

55:53.484 --> 55:54.982
The wedding machine
cannot be stopped!

55:54.984 --> 55:56.715
- The wedding must go on.
- We go inside.

55:56.717 --> 55:58.482
- One tea, she relax.
- What do you mean, tea?

55:58.484 --> 56:01.115
The groom is waiting!
I spent a lot of money.

56:01.117 --> 56:04.215
- I failed you! Don't stop!
- Dad!

56:04.217 --> 56:08.284
I don't want to end up
like his mother!

56:11.417 --> 56:13.050
Alex.

56:31.217 --> 56:33.948
Nousha! Nousha!

57:25.783 --> 57:27.748
Nousha.

57:29.217 --> 57:30.848
Come on, open up.

57:34.050 --> 57:36.717
I can literally see you moving.

57:41.050 --> 57:42.382
We brought Lulu.

57:42.384 --> 57:43.882
Look, she's here too.

57:43.884 --> 57:45.781
- She wants to see you.
- Yeah.

57:45.783 --> 57:48.683
- There's a key under the pot.
- Okay.

57:49.984 --> 57:52.151
- Yup, look at this.
- Okay.

57:54.184 --> 57:57.349
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
No, no, no, no.

57:57.351 --> 57:59.449
- No, no, no.
- We are here to help you.

57:59.451 --> 58:00.882
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

58:00.884 --> 58:02.182
I don't wanna talk.

58:02.184 --> 58:04.449
We're taking you
to our healer for sure.

58:04.451 --> 58:06.815
- Why? I'm fine!
- You look like afterbirth.

58:06.817 --> 58:09.015
- You smell like caca pants.
- Very, very, very, bad,

58:09.017 --> 58:10.748
what we're looking at
and smelling right now.

58:10.750 --> 58:12.482
- I got it.
- What is this?

58:12.484 --> 58:14.082
Oh, my God,
is that cheese?

58:14.084 --> 58:15.882
You really just smell
of diapers and cheese.

58:15.884 --> 58:17.817
You smell like
the inside of a person.

58:21.117 --> 58:23.082
Okay, fine.
I get it, I get it.

58:23.084 --> 58:24.715
Good, good.

58:24.717 --> 58:26.815
I can't believe
I haven't heard from him.

58:26.817 --> 58:29.117
He blocked me on Facebook.

58:30.717 --> 58:32.715
No, he deleted his account.

58:32.717 --> 58:37.781
What? He would never be
such a social media whore.

58:37.783 --> 58:39.482
What about Instagram?

58:39.484 --> 58:41.015
Mm-mm.

58:41.017 --> 58:42.748
What about Twitter?

58:42.750 --> 58:44.715
- I mean...
- What about Google Plus?

58:44.717 --> 58:46.815
Really?

58:46.817 --> 58:48.715
Can't believe
he broke up with me.

58:48.717 --> 58:50.748
Well, you did leave him
at the altar

58:50.750 --> 58:52.884
and turn into a phoenix.

58:54.750 --> 58:57.182
I don't blame him.

58:57.184 --> 58:58.915
Okay, come on, let's...
No, no, no, no!

58:58.917 --> 59:01.048
Let's get dressed,
let's get dressed.

59:01.050 --> 59:04.650
You don't know yet
who you are or what you want.

59:08.117 --> 59:11.715
I really want
a cheeseburger right now.

59:11.717 --> 59:13.349
I know that.

59:13.351 --> 59:15.215
The emotional freedom
technique

59:15.217 --> 59:18.382
sends calm signals
to your brain,

59:18.384 --> 59:20.748
so follow me.

59:20.750 --> 59:23.781
Even though I am heartbroken,

59:23.783 --> 59:26.848
I fully love and accept myself.

59:26.850 --> 59:28.984
So now you try it.

59:31.151 --> 59:34.115
Even though...

59:34.117 --> 59:37.015
I'm heartbroken,

59:37.017 --> 59:39.984
I fully love
and accept myself.

59:41.817 --> 59:46.982
Even though I hurt
the only man I've ever loved,

59:46.984 --> 59:49.382
I fully love
and accept myself.

59:49.384 --> 59:54.915
Even though I'm probably
gonna die alone,

59:54.917 --> 59:57.284
I fully love
and accept myself.

59:58.984 --> 01:00:03.249
Even though I wanna crawl
into a hole and die,

01:00:03.251 --> 01:00:04.715
I love and accept...

01:00:04.717 --> 01:00:06.815
Fully love and accept myself.

01:00:06.817 --> 01:00:10.117
Fully love and accept myself.

01:00:14.417 --> 01:00:15.848
Very good.

01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:17.848
I feel better.

01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:20.349
Wonderful.

01:00:20.351 --> 01:00:21.715
Cash or check?

01:00:21.717 --> 01:00:23.415
Cash only, please.

01:00:23.417 --> 01:00:24.817
Okay.

01:00:30.417 --> 01:00:32.115
Hello?

01:00:32.117 --> 01:00:33.715
<i>Why aren't you
calling me back?</i>

01:00:33.717 --> 01:00:35.315
<i>I was just about
to call the police.</i>

01:00:35.317 --> 01:00:37.815
I was going to, Mom.
I was just busy.

01:00:37.817 --> 01:00:40.382
<i>You're not getting any younger.
You need to start dating again.</i>

01:00:40.384 --> 01:00:42.349
It's only been a few weeks, Mom.

01:00:42.351 --> 01:00:45.748
<i>Ali, Fariba's son, heard about
the fireworks at the altar.</i>

01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:47.948
<i>He wants to take you out.</i>

01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:51.151
<i>Nousha, he just finished
dental school too.</i>

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:57.683
- <i>Nousha?</i>
- Okay, Mom, yeah, set it up.

01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:10.315
From what I hear,
you're a little unconventional.

01:01:10.317 --> 01:01:12.015
That's an understatement.

01:01:12.017 --> 01:01:17.282
Yeah, and I heard you set off
a bomb at your wedding.

01:01:17.284 --> 01:01:21.817
I'm sorry.
I should be more sensitive.

01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:25.182
So what was it like?

01:01:25.184 --> 01:01:27.915
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:01:27.917 --> 01:01:29.815
Sure.

01:01:29.817 --> 01:01:31.115
Nosy, I know.

01:01:31.117 --> 01:01:32.315
Excuse me.

01:01:32.317 --> 01:01:34.182
Can I have some more
alcohol, please?

01:01:34.184 --> 01:01:35.982
They're good, huh?

01:01:35.984 --> 01:01:37.215
I looked the Yelp up.

01:01:37.217 --> 01:01:39.415
It was like top three
martinis in LA.

01:01:39.417 --> 01:01:40.982
The other two were too far.

01:01:40.984 --> 01:01:42.748
It's nice that you
did your research.

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:43.748
'Course.

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:45.048
Thank you, Tony.

01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:47.482
Do you make Persian food?

01:01:47.484 --> 01:01:50.349
Chenje, ghormeh sabzi?

01:01:50.351 --> 01:01:52.315
Umm...

01:01:52.317 --> 01:01:54.382
I'm gonna take that as a no.

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:56.982
But cheers.

01:01:56.984 --> 01:01:59.781
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:01:59.783 --> 01:02:02.650
- So you're a dentist?
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:06.050 --> 01:02:07.750
Okay.

01:02:10.417 --> 01:02:12.251
- Great.
- Great.

01:02:15.017 --> 01:02:16.982
You're a really nice guy.

01:02:16.984 --> 01:02:19.382
Thanks. So are you.

01:02:19.384 --> 01:02:21.815
Thank you, but I'm not.

01:02:21.817 --> 01:02:23.848
I'm never gonna be
a good Persian wife,

01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:27.848
or a good wife
or a good person.

01:02:27.850 --> 01:02:30.282
I think you're great.

01:02:30.284 --> 01:02:32.284
You do?

01:02:39.384 --> 01:02:40.650
Oh.

01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:47.948
Unzip me.

01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:51.315
- This isn't too fast for you?
- No, no, just go for it.

01:02:51.317 --> 01:02:52.317
All right.

01:02:53.384 --> 01:02:54.382
Just...

01:02:54.384 --> 01:02:55.848
You got it, you got it.

01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:57.984
I'm goin' there,
all right, okay.

01:03:00.917 --> 01:03:01.884
Wow!

01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:09.915
You know, I actually
took this photo of her.

01:03:09.917 --> 01:03:13.215
Yeah, my dream has always
been to marry someone

01:03:13.217 --> 01:03:16.215
as wonderful as my mom.

01:03:16.217 --> 01:03:18.948
And you know,
you remind me of her.

01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:21.781
Do you mind
zipping me back up?

01:03:21.783 --> 01:03:24.017
Uh, okay.

01:03:25.783 --> 01:03:27.048
Thank you so much.

01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:31.082
You know,
I actually have to go.

01:03:31.084 --> 01:03:34.282
- No!
- Yeah, I have court.

01:03:34.284 --> 01:03:35.349
Tomorrow.

01:03:35.351 --> 01:03:37.182
Bye.

01:03:37.184 --> 01:03:38.984
Bye.

01:03:42.917 --> 01:03:44.717
You were right about her.

01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:21.149
I really wish
you guys were here.

01:04:21.151 --> 01:04:24.082
<i>Yeah, we do too,
but Lulu's not feeling well.</i>

01:04:24.084 --> 01:04:26.349
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:04:26.351 --> 01:04:29.215
I'm just gonna drop off
the toothbrush and then leave.

01:04:29.217 --> 01:04:30.948
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>We just want you to know</i>

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.382
<i>that we don't think
this is a good idea.</i>

01:04:32.384 --> 01:04:34.748
I know, but please
just stay on the phone.

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:37.715
- <i>We support you.</i>
- <i>We support you.</i>

01:04:37.717 --> 01:04:39.715
<i>All right, say bye, honey.
Okay, bye.</i>

01:04:39.717 --> 01:04:40.948
<i>Bye, we love you.</i>

01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:42.048
<i>Love you.</i>

01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:44.182
No, wait!

01:04:44.184 --> 01:04:47.115
You sound like you could use
some good stuff.

01:04:47.117 --> 01:04:50.249
Do you have like caffeine pills?
I'm really tired.

01:04:50.251 --> 01:04:53.115
I promise you'll feel great.

01:04:53.117 --> 01:04:55.182
If everything goes south,
will I remember tomorrow?

01:04:55.184 --> 01:04:56.915
No.

01:04:56.917 --> 01:04:59.084
I'll take two, please.

01:05:27.317 --> 01:05:31.781
Excuse me, can you lift me up?
I really need to see the deejay.

01:05:31.783 --> 01:05:33.184
- All right.
- Thank you.

01:05:35.984 --> 01:05:37.984
There! Have your look.

01:05:48.084 --> 01:05:49.781
Take over for a minute.

01:05:58.917 --> 01:06:01.249
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:06:01.251 --> 01:06:04.282
Um, I brought your toothbrush.

01:06:04.284 --> 01:06:07.048
Christ, Nousha,
what are you doing here?

01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:09.482
What, you don't call or text,
and you blocked me on Facebook,

01:06:09.484 --> 01:06:11.349
so how else was I supposed
to bring your toothbrush?

01:06:11.351 --> 01:06:14.048
You dumped me at the altar
in front of everybody.

01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:15.882
You broke my fucking heart.

01:06:15.884 --> 01:06:18.449
I fucked up. I was scared.
I was insecure.

01:06:18.451 --> 01:06:20.048
There was too much
pressure on me.

01:06:20.050 --> 01:06:22.251
And no, I didn't mean
what I said.

01:06:24.317 --> 01:06:26.815
I'm ready now.
I'm ready.

01:06:26.817 --> 01:06:29.781
It's too late for me.

01:06:29.783 --> 01:06:31.115
I love you.

01:06:31.117 --> 01:06:32.750
No, you don't.

01:06:39.284 --> 01:06:40.848
- Whoo!
- Oh!

01:06:40.850 --> 01:06:42.783
Hey, watch it, girl!

01:06:46.417 --> 01:06:47.815
Nousha!

01:06:47.817 --> 01:06:49.650
Mom?

01:06:52.284 --> 01:06:54.449
How long has this
been going on?

01:06:54.451 --> 01:06:58.182
Almost since your wedding,
or your breakup.

01:06:58.184 --> 01:07:00.715
We were going to tell you,

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:04.048
but I guess
we could tell them now.

01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:05.717
Tell us what?

01:07:07.151 --> 01:07:09.715
Sam and I are getting married.

01:07:09.717 --> 01:07:11.215
Who's Sam?

01:07:11.217 --> 01:07:12.217
Saman!

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:14.848
That Sam?

01:07:14.850 --> 01:07:16.783
And I'm converting.

01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:20.315
Can you rub my arm?

01:07:20.317 --> 01:07:22.115
Mom, why are you here?

01:07:22.117 --> 01:07:25.848
Oh, honey, no,
we go dancing all the time.

01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:28.781
We have been following you
as DJ Mohammed.

01:07:28.783 --> 01:07:31.748
I got married so early,
and Sam was sent off to war.

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:34.650
We just never had a chance
to be young.

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:37.282
Alex, it's never too late.

01:07:37.284 --> 01:07:41.982
No. As Hafez says,
"You must always stay close

01:07:41.984 --> 01:07:46.149
to anything that makes you
feel glad to be alive."

01:07:46.151 --> 01:07:48.282
Or something like that,
I think. Right?

01:07:48.284 --> 01:07:49.715
You got it.

01:07:49.717 --> 01:07:50.815
Okay, no, stop.

01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:52.082
Could you please stop?

01:07:52.084 --> 01:07:53.115
Stop.

01:07:53.117 --> 01:07:54.683
Am I tripping?

01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:57.748
I think so.

01:08:12.017 --> 01:08:15.215
Even your Uncle Saman
is getting married before you.

01:08:15.217 --> 01:08:17.948
God, I'm so happy
for you.

01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:19.715
What happened to Ali?

01:08:19.716 --> 01:08:22.115
I'm not doing another one
of your arrangements.

01:08:22.117 --> 01:08:24.182
You're not doing this
to me again, Nousha.

01:08:24.184 --> 01:08:26.082
How dare you drop a doctor.

01:08:26.084 --> 01:08:28.215
He wasn't a doctor.
He was a dentist.

01:08:30.850 --> 01:08:33.982
Whatever.
I just want you to be happy.

01:08:33.984 --> 01:08:37.950
Well, you're making me
miserable, so...

01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:50.814
Nousha, your mother loves you.

01:08:50.817 --> 01:08:52.917
She just doesn't know
any better.

01:09:03.384 --> 01:09:06.417
Child bride. She had no choice.

01:09:25.884 --> 01:09:27.683
Yes, baby.

01:09:35.084 --> 01:09:38.683
And if you're lesbian,
that's okay too.

01:09:52.417 --> 01:09:53.415
Hi.

01:09:53.417 --> 01:09:54.783
Hey.

01:09:57.783 --> 01:09:59.882
Keep your eyes
on the board, okay?

01:09:59.884 --> 01:10:02.082
Now I know why I was always
too afraid to do this.

01:10:02.084 --> 01:10:04.915
No, don't overthink it, Noush.
Just trust.

01:10:04.917 --> 01:10:05.982
Trust?

01:10:05.984 --> 01:10:07.650
- Trust.
- Trust.

01:10:08.717 --> 01:10:10.182
Trust!

01:10:12.184 --> 01:10:14.482
You have to learn
how to be alone.

01:10:14.484 --> 01:10:17.750
The quietness in your heart
will give you the answers.

01:10:23.984 --> 01:10:26.449
Is this one of the ones
you put in your vagina?

01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:50.282
How did you say bye
to those eyes?

01:10:50.284 --> 01:10:52.982
Well, it was
a mutual agreement.

01:10:52.984 --> 01:10:55.982
For me, it was something else.
I don't wanna go there.

01:10:55.984 --> 01:10:57.948
Sorry.

01:11:02.117 --> 01:11:04.650
Wanna grab a cheeseburger
together?

01:11:05.984 --> 01:11:07.715
Just kidding.

01:11:07.717 --> 01:11:09.149
I'm vegan now.

01:11:10.484 --> 01:11:11.915
Namaste.

01:11:13.317 --> 01:11:14.315
Did I do it right?

01:12:22.917 --> 01:12:24.482
- No.
- Oh.

01:12:24.484 --> 01:12:27.015
Right? What?

01:12:49.783 --> 01:12:52.251
I thought you might need this.

01:12:56.184 --> 01:12:57.850
Thank you.

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:01.182
Bill's out there,

01:13:01.184 --> 01:13:03.815
trying to teach Ziba
how to use a BlackBerry.

01:13:03.817 --> 01:13:05.781
He is not.

01:13:05.783 --> 01:13:07.349
Oh, my gosh.

01:13:07.351 --> 01:13:11.151
You know, I've never really
given you enough credit.

01:13:13.151 --> 01:13:15.117
He's not easy.

01:13:16.417 --> 01:13:18.149
Girl...

01:13:18.151 --> 01:13:20.315
We have a lot to talk about.

01:13:20.317 --> 01:13:22.017
We do.

01:13:24.783 --> 01:13:26.948
You look...

01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:28.750
divine.

01:13:30.117 --> 01:13:31.817
Thank you.

01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:35.815
You ready, Mom?

01:13:35.817 --> 01:13:37.915
Ohh! More than ready.

01:13:37.917 --> 01:13:40.182
I love that man.

01:13:40.184 --> 01:13:44.082
And besides, the sexual
chemistry is off the charts.

01:13:44.084 --> 01:13:46.449
- Mom...
- I literally didn't even know

01:13:46.451 --> 01:13:47.482
that I could bend like...

01:13:47.484 --> 01:13:49.217
Okay, Mom, stop.

01:14:00.984 --> 01:14:01.950
Alex...

01:14:05.050 --> 01:14:07.884
I want you to be happy.

01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:10.717
I am happy.

01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:14.748
I think Hafez said

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:19.284
that love forgives
and heals.

01:14:21.717 --> 01:14:23.117
You look beautiful.

01:14:26.017 --> 01:14:28.050
- See you out there.
- Okay.

01:14:36.351 --> 01:14:37.351
Thanks.

01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:41.449
Uh-huh.

01:14:41.451 --> 01:14:43.817
Like James Bond.

01:14:52.451 --> 01:14:54.748
Tell me what's wrong.

01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:58.449
I'm honestly so happy for you.
It's okay.

01:14:58.451 --> 01:15:00.817
You are not happy.

01:15:02.484 --> 01:15:05.215
No, I'm not.

01:15:05.217 --> 01:15:07.982
I really miss him.

01:15:07.984 --> 01:15:10.917
I don't think he's ever
gonna forgive me.

01:15:14.884 --> 01:15:18.449
You know what's wrong
with your generation?

01:15:18.451 --> 01:15:20.149
You're too skeptical.

01:15:20.151 --> 01:15:23.382
Always doubting everything.

01:15:23.384 --> 01:15:25.384
So afraid of marriage.

01:15:27.417 --> 01:15:31.082
It's this Internet.

01:15:31.084 --> 01:15:34.982
Nousha, you don't know
how to have faith.

01:15:34.984 --> 01:15:37.848
You have to believe in things.

01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:40.882
That's how life moves forward.

01:15:40.884 --> 01:15:42.817
That's a God lecture.

01:15:44.151 --> 01:15:47.182
1986, the Iran-Iraq War.

01:15:47.184 --> 01:15:49.715
We are in the depths of hell.

01:15:49.717 --> 01:15:51.015
The government was broke,

01:15:51.017 --> 01:15:54.048
so we had limited arms
and no supplies.

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:57.948
But my men, they marched on.

01:15:57.950 --> 01:16:02.217
We took Najaf with just one tank
and a handful of grenades.

01:16:04.884 --> 01:16:07.217
But then we heard
the airstrikes.

01:16:08.284 --> 01:16:10.482
Chemical weapons.

01:16:10.484 --> 01:16:12.715
It was Saddam.

01:16:12.717 --> 01:16:15.117
He blasted my men.

01:16:16.817 --> 01:16:18.282
Most of them died...

01:16:18.284 --> 01:16:19.351
like that.

01:16:21.384 --> 01:16:24.717
But I just lost
a few ligaments.

01:16:25.984 --> 01:16:28.781
How did I never know
about that?

01:16:28.783 --> 01:16:30.948
I also have a scar
on my backside right here.

01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:34.384
No, I don't need...
I'm good, I'm good.

01:16:39.017 --> 01:16:44.349
The point is, Nousha,
that even in my darkest hour,

01:16:44.351 --> 01:16:46.815
I still had faith.

01:16:46.817 --> 01:16:50.382
I knew that one day
there would be a light,

01:16:50.384 --> 01:16:52.982
and that light...

01:16:52.984 --> 01:16:54.850
is Maggie.

01:16:57.917 --> 01:17:01.482
If you're constantly
living in fear,

01:17:01.484 --> 01:17:05.215
you won't let the light in.

01:17:05.217 --> 01:17:07.781
As in love,

01:17:07.783 --> 01:17:10.382
it's simple.

01:17:10.384 --> 01:17:13.151
And you should never give up.

01:17:17.850 --> 01:17:20.050
I'm gonna need your help
with something.

01:17:21.484 --> 01:17:22.950
Pigeon.

01:17:24.384 --> 01:17:25.415
Thanks, Saman.

01:17:25.417 --> 01:17:27.117
Of course, darling.

01:17:41.351 --> 01:17:42.349
Hi.

01:17:42.351 --> 01:17:43.882
Ready?

01:17:43.884 --> 01:17:45.349
I am.

01:17:45.351 --> 01:17:47.882
Actually, Alex,
if you don't mind,

01:17:47.884 --> 01:17:51.915
I would really like to walk
your mother down the aisle.

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:53.315
Of course, Dad.

01:17:53.317 --> 01:17:54.315
Thank you.

01:17:54.317 --> 01:17:57.282
Um, you all got me here,

01:17:57.284 --> 01:18:00.415
so you all are walking me
down the aisle.

01:18:00.417 --> 01:18:03.415
Hey, you too, Steven!

01:18:03.417 --> 01:18:05.449
Get in here,
you handsome bastard.

01:18:07.251 --> 01:18:08.415
Quite a family.

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:09.948
You ready?

01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:11.781
Right legs first.

01:18:21.850 --> 01:18:24.750
I'm gonna leave you here.
You're on your own.

01:18:25.817 --> 01:18:26.848
Be amazing.

01:18:26.850 --> 01:18:28.315
Thank you.

01:18:28.317 --> 01:18:30.151
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:18:39.984 --> 01:18:43.382
Thank you all for coming.

01:18:43.384 --> 01:18:47.349
Love is not about
keeping a score,

01:18:47.351 --> 01:18:50.415
hesitation or fear.

01:18:50.417 --> 01:18:56.048
Love is about sacrifice,
understanding

01:18:56.050 --> 01:18:58.848
and forgiveness.

01:18:58.850 --> 01:19:01.415
As the great Persian poet says,

01:19:01.417 --> 01:19:04.815
"And still after all this time,

01:19:04.817 --> 01:19:07.915
the sun never says to the Earth,

01:19:07.917 --> 01:19:09.717
'You owe me.'"

01:19:11.384 --> 01:19:15.249
Look what happens
with that kind of love.

01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:18.750
It lights the whole sky.

01:19:22.251 --> 01:19:27.284
Now may I ask the ladies join me
for the Persian canopy.

01:19:35.384 --> 01:19:37.217
Rings, please?

01:19:41.251 --> 01:19:43.249
Thank you.

01:19:43.251 --> 01:19:45.748
Maggie Baker...

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:49.082
do you accept
Saman Amir Husseini

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:51.748
as your husband willingly,

01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:54.249
without any reservation?

01:19:54.251 --> 01:19:56.417
I sure do.

01:19:58.850 --> 01:20:02.815
Saman Amir Husseini,

01:20:02.817 --> 01:20:06.781
do you take Maggie Baker
as your wife willingly,

01:20:06.783 --> 01:20:09.715
without any reservation?

01:20:09.717 --> 01:20:11.717
Heck yes.

01:20:13.284 --> 01:20:15.715
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:20:15.717 --> 01:20:18.084
You may kiss the bride.

01:20:19.484 --> 01:20:21.482
Ha ha! Whoo!

01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:24.449
Now let's party!

01:20:47.284 --> 01:20:50.382
Mmm!

01:20:50.384 --> 01:20:51.948
Yeah!

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:53.482
Whoo!

01:20:53.484 --> 01:20:55.415
- That's so good.
- Delicious.

01:20:55.417 --> 01:20:57.282
Sweet like you.

01:20:57.284 --> 01:20:59.282
You know,
there are weirder things.

01:20:59.284 --> 01:21:00.915
Yeah.

01:21:00.917 --> 01:21:02.215
Oh, yeah?

01:21:02.217 --> 01:21:03.748
- Yeah, plenty.
- For sure.

01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:04.717
Name one.

01:21:09.284 --> 01:21:10.449
Oh, sorry.

01:21:10.451 --> 01:21:12.982
I'll be right back, okay?

01:21:12.984 --> 01:21:14.382
Thank you.

01:21:17.151 --> 01:21:19.449
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

01:21:19.451 --> 01:21:21.415
I just would like to say

01:21:21.417 --> 01:21:25.948
that today has been the most
wonderful day of my life.

01:21:29.850 --> 01:21:31.482
Thank you.

01:21:31.484 --> 01:21:36.249
And it is not only because
I had the pleasure

01:21:36.251 --> 01:21:38.882
of marrying
this beautiful goddess

01:21:38.884 --> 01:21:41.048
and the love of my life,

01:21:41.050 --> 01:21:43.315
Maggie Baker-Husseini,

01:21:43.317 --> 01:21:45.882
but also I would like to say

01:21:45.884 --> 01:21:50.815
that we have today with us
in the house

01:21:50.817 --> 01:21:53.182
one of my favorite singers
in the whole world.

01:21:53.184 --> 01:21:56.781
Ladies and gentlemen,
please help me welcome

01:21:56.783 --> 01:21:58.715
Miss Celine Dion.

01:21:58.717 --> 01:22:01.482
Oh, my God!

01:22:05.917 --> 01:22:06.950
- My favorite!
- There she is!

01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:11.251
Celine, Celine, Celine!

01:22:14.484 --> 01:22:16.783
