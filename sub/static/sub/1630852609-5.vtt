WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:03.237
This is not RuPaul's
Best Friend Race.

00:03.237 --> 00:04.771
I feel very attacked!

00:04.771 --> 00:07.808
If you don't have star quality,
get the fuck outta here.

00:07.808 --> 00:10.544
Oh, my God.

00:10.544 --> 00:14.348
RuPaul: This is Untucked,
backstage at the competition

00:14.348 --> 00:18.352
to become America's
next drag superstar.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.254
Girl, if you're not watching
Untucked,

00:20.254 --> 00:22.956
you're only getting
half the story.

00:30.898 --> 00:34.201
Today I'm walking
a little bit slower.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.670
I kinda damaged my ankle
during the acting challenge.

00:36.670 --> 00:39.039
I did not realize
how severe it was

00:39.039 --> 00:40.107
until I went home.

00:40.107 --> 00:43.477
Like, this isn't
gradually healing.

00:43.477 --> 00:46.947
Baby, I am in pain,
Miss Thing.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.782
I didn't expect
to go out like--

00:48.782 --> 00:50.250
I didn't expect to go out
at all,

00:50.250 --> 00:53.654
but I definitely didn't expect
to go out like this, you know.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.289
I went to urgent care
and she said,

00:55.289 --> 00:57.858
"You shouldn't be on your feet
for long periods of time

00:57.858 --> 00:59.526
for six to eight weeks,"

00:59.526 --> 01:00.961
which basically meant

01:00.961 --> 01:02.796
I can't participate
in challenges,

01:02.796 --> 01:04.932
I can't walk the runway.

01:04.932 --> 01:07.701
So that news
was not fun to hear.

01:07.701 --> 01:11.905
It's weird
packing my stuff away,

01:11.905 --> 01:14.141
'cause, girl, these bitches

01:14.141 --> 01:15.776
supposed to be leaving
before me, honey.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.210
I ain't supposed to be taking
nothing away right now.

01:17.210 --> 01:19.313
This is supposed to be
me leaving on the last day

01:19.313 --> 01:20.580
after I done wore
all this stuff

01:20.580 --> 01:22.316
and it smell a little musty.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.651
Imma just sit.

01:24.651 --> 01:26.019
Oh.

01:26.019 --> 01:28.088
I read on the back
of this chocolate,

01:28.088 --> 01:30.524
and it said if it's gold,
it's gonna heal my ankle, girl,

01:30.524 --> 01:31.892
and they gonna put me
right back in.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.560
So let's see.
No, I'm kidding.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.761
We gonna see
what my fate is, girl.

01:34.761 --> 01:35.896
Although I didn't think

01:35.896 --> 01:37.698
I was gonna ever need
this moment.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.267
I'm pretty good
at the lip syncing thing.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.708
Ooh, girl.

01:47.708 --> 01:51.578
It's just a chocolate bar.

01:51.578 --> 01:53.113
But I ain't sad, girl,

01:53.113 --> 01:54.815
'cause I wasn't gonna
need it in the first place.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.483
Honey, them ho's wasn't
about to send me home.

01:56.483 --> 01:57.918
I got something up my sleeve,

01:57.918 --> 01:59.086
or up my leg, my girl.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.253
You see how that happens.

02:00.253 --> 02:02.222
Gonna put this in my bag
and take this home.

02:02.222 --> 02:04.958
Queen limpin'.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.894
Little limpin' Linda, honey,
limpin' Linda, girl.

02:07.894 --> 02:09.229
I do not like the fact

02:09.229 --> 02:11.932
that this is the way
I'm going out of the
competition.

02:11.932 --> 02:17.404
Leaving my friendships behind,
like Willow and Kerri,

02:17.404 --> 02:18.805
that's the hard part.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.607
But, baby,
this ain't the end, honey.

02:20.607 --> 02:24.578
You come back stronger
and better than ever always.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.049
Ouch!

02:29.049 --> 02:30.617
My ankle.

02:30.617 --> 02:31.785
[laughs]

02:31.785 --> 02:33.553
♪ My ankle ♪

02:33.553 --> 02:36.923
♪ My...ankle ♪

02:36.923 --> 02:39.493
[chuckles]

02:41.294 --> 02:43.430
Director: That's a break
on the main stage.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.664
All cameras re-po.

02:44.664 --> 02:47.200
RuPaul: Ladies,
I've made some decisions.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.735
Kerri Colby.

02:48.735 --> 02:50.437
DeJa Skye.

02:50.437 --> 02:52.439
Maddy Morphosis.

02:52.439 --> 02:53.807
Willow Pill.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.342
Daya Betty.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.610
You are all safe.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.311
You may leave the stage.

03:03.984 --> 03:06.420
My stomach's in knots.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.056
I don't really know
what I did bad on,

03:09.056 --> 03:11.391
but I also don't know
what I did good on.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.960
I need the critiques.

03:13.960 --> 03:17.030
That is what's
driving my crazy.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.866
I'm really kind of
frustrated here,

03:19.866 --> 03:22.169
because I keep ending up safe.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.670
I came here to prove

03:23.670 --> 03:27.741
that I am a fucking fierce
superstar of drag.

03:27.741 --> 03:31.244
It's time for me
to remind people of that.

03:31.244 --> 03:33.880
I feel like
I should be in the top.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.982
Our group worked
amazing together,

03:35.982 --> 03:40.420
and I feel great and proud
of the girls in our team.

03:41.621 --> 03:43.557
-Cameras up.
-Copy that. Here we go.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.525
Queens walking.

03:45.525 --> 03:47.160
Let me make sure I fit, child.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.728
Come on, Kerri,
let's get through here, girl.

03:48.728 --> 03:49.796
Whew.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.064
It's the house
that Willow built.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.833
We live to see another day.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.101
Are you guys
in line at the bar?

03:54.101 --> 03:55.936
-Honey.
-Are you guys in line?

03:55.936 --> 03:57.270
You shut your mouth.

03:57.270 --> 03:59.339
Ooh! In the corner, baby.

03:59.339 --> 04:00.807
We made it. We safe.

04:00.807 --> 04:02.008
We live to see another day.

04:02.008 --> 04:03.710
So how are we feeling, y'all?
How we feeling?

04:03.710 --> 04:05.679
I'm a little bit, like, eh,

04:05.679 --> 04:07.814
because I really did
wanna be in the top.

04:07.814 --> 04:09.483
You definitely got ugly
this week, so great job.

04:09.483 --> 04:12.886
Yeah, I was trying to be
downright hideous, child.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.554
Whenever you pulled out,
like, this green dress,

04:14.554 --> 04:16.223
I was, like, she's gonna be
in the bottom.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.860
It was just a plain green dress
with a couple of flowers.

04:19.860 --> 04:20.961
I was, like,
oh, she's in trouble.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.063
But then when you
put it all together

04:23.063 --> 04:24.865
with all the other stuff
as well,

04:24.865 --> 04:26.600
it's, like, one of
my favorite runways tonight.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.634
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah.

04:27.634 --> 04:29.836
I did do something different,

04:29.836 --> 04:32.172
but you can feel, like,
you're giving what you have.

04:32.172 --> 04:33.607
You can feel fucking crazy,

04:33.607 --> 04:36.877
and when these cameras
pick it up

04:36.877 --> 04:40.280
and it plays back,
it goes down 20%.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.049
So you really have to, like,
kind of squirt a little bit

04:43.049 --> 04:44.084
when you out there.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.218
Ooh!

04:45.218 --> 04:46.887
I will say with Willow,

04:46.887 --> 04:48.655
I really thought
you were gonna be in the top.

04:48.655 --> 04:50.157
I think with your runway
tonight,

04:50.157 --> 04:52.058
like the house and everything,
it's so out of the box.

04:52.058 --> 04:54.294
I don't agree with you
being just safe.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.429
They're just tired of me
being in the top all the time.

04:56.429 --> 04:57.931
Aah!

04:57.931 --> 04:58.999
I am so happy.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.034
I was a little worried,
because I feel

05:01.034 --> 05:02.903
that the rest of our team
is in the bottom.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.204
Really?

05:04.204 --> 05:07.007
And I was afraid that
if we were judged as groups,

05:07.007 --> 05:08.775
that I would be
in the bottom with them.

05:08.775 --> 05:13.213
I'm very pleasantly surprised
that they're doing individual.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.915
That way, no one's coasting,

05:14.915 --> 05:17.117
no one's kind of
just getting lucky.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.385
But they all were really good.

05:18.385 --> 05:19.786
This is, like,
one of my favorite looks

05:19.786 --> 05:20.987
I've ever, like, done.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.222
So I was so excited about it.

05:22.222 --> 05:23.690
I really felt like
this might be my week.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.792
Yeah. I don't know if you're
getting the credit you deserve.

05:25.792 --> 05:26.927
Agreed.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.828
I know you run the fucking show.

05:28.828 --> 05:31.364
You are doing fantastic at
being the leader of your groups.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.532
Yeah.

05:32.532 --> 05:34.534
For my group,
I felt like I was a leader,

05:34.534 --> 05:36.369
and, like, it's kind of hard,
because I don't know

05:36.369 --> 05:39.139
where the other girls
in my group were placed.

05:39.139 --> 05:42.209
I don't know if Bosco's read.

05:42.209 --> 05:45.212
Did you know
that some drag queens

05:45.212 --> 05:49.616
have to get ready
in less than seven hours?

05:49.616 --> 05:54.120
I don't know if either of them
are in the top.

05:54.120 --> 05:58.158
However, I felt like
I did really strong,

05:58.158 --> 06:00.994
and I'm fine being safe,
but I need that critique.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.596
What can I do better
to place me?

06:02.596 --> 06:04.164
You've been safe
this whole time, huh?

06:04.164 --> 06:05.799
I thought I was really strong.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.734
I'm not complaining
about being here,

06:07.734 --> 06:09.869
because I'm not that girl.
I'm not Jasmine.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.538
Aah!

06:11.538 --> 06:14.574
But it's true. It's like
I felt like I did really good.

06:14.574 --> 06:16.710
I did, too.
I'll be completely honest.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.111
That's okay.

06:18.111 --> 06:21.681
I think that I'm the strongest
in my group,

06:21.681 --> 06:24.651
and we are getting to that point
in the competition

06:24.651 --> 06:26.753
where the people
that are constantly safe

06:26.753 --> 06:29.589
are being recognized
for all the wrong reasons.

06:29.589 --> 06:32.759
That is what is driving me
a little loopy.

06:32.759 --> 06:33.860
Is there anyone that
you're surprised isn't here?

06:33.860 --> 06:35.028
Oh, so fuck my drag.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.663
Y'all ain't gonna ask me
about my shit.

06:36.663 --> 06:37.731
Okay, great.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.901
-DeJa, how do you feel today?
-Wow.

06:41.901 --> 06:42.902
How do you feel
about your experience?

06:42.902 --> 06:43.937
No, it's fine.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.973
Whatever.
It's fine, it's fine.

06:48.675 --> 06:49.909
I'm not gonna cry,
I'm not gonna cry.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.945
-My last name is Kennedie.
-[laughs]

06:51.945 --> 06:53.780
-Well, hello.
-Hey, girls!

06:53.780 --> 06:55.582
Come over here, y'all.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.351
Come get a seat, queens.

06:58.351 --> 06:59.486
-Welcome, ladies.
-Hi!

06:59.486 --> 07:02.389
Shall we cheers
to the returning queens?

07:02.389 --> 07:03.390
Thank you.

07:03.390 --> 07:05.058
And y'all look good!

07:05.058 --> 07:06.760
Clink, clink, clink,
clink, clink.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.228
Welcome back, bitches.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.429
What do you think of the videos?

07:09.429 --> 07:10.764
It was just hard to read.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.066
Well, maybe you all
just aren't funny.

07:13.066 --> 07:16.069
[laughs]

07:17.804 --> 07:20.307
They were surprisingly good.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.741
-Surprisingly?
-No, no, no.

07:21.741 --> 07:23.877
It's not that I thought--
I mean, maybe.

07:23.877 --> 07:27.580
I think the camera was
very kind to a lot of people.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.684
I really thought y'all
were going home, honestly.

07:30.684 --> 07:31.851
[laughs]

07:31.851 --> 07:34.287
How did you guys think about,
like, as groups?

07:34.287 --> 07:35.789
Well, I did good.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.557
Okay, great.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.426
The rest of y'all, you
filled in the blanks very nice.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.261
Aah, filler queens!

07:41.261 --> 07:42.729
You were a solid
middle of the road safe.

07:42.729 --> 07:44.130
I'm comfortable with that.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.566
You know, comfortable middle
of the road is where I wanna be.

07:46.566 --> 07:48.134
An improvement over your season.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.603
[gasps] Maddy!

07:50.603 --> 07:51.805
She has been shading me
this whole time.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.273
Well, here's the thing.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.274
I don't think
you guys know this.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.408
He's actually fully straight.

07:55.408 --> 07:56.843
I just learned, like,
five minutes ago.

07:56.843 --> 07:58.445
No, bitch, I'm a lesbian.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.680
[all laugh]
Do you know what?

08:00.680 --> 08:02.015
You are top-shelf drag now.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.917
You are all top-shelf drag.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.819
And when you leave here,
you're gonna have haters.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.654
-Because that's what they do.
-Oh, absolutely.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.022
Yeah, I can't wait.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.290
But, you know,
you just remind them.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.825
What show were you on?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.460
Okurr?

08:13.460 --> 08:15.261
And you're here, and no one can
ever take that away from you.

08:15.261 --> 08:16.262
Exactly.

08:16.262 --> 08:17.764
And you have all of us now.

08:17.764 --> 08:18.832
We're your family now.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.900
Each of you guys
have been so endearing

08:20.900 --> 08:22.802
and had nothing
but kind words to say.

08:22.802 --> 08:24.437
And I can say the same
to all y'all, too.

08:24.437 --> 08:25.672
I'll tell you that, like,

08:25.672 --> 08:28.875
I have not met any girl
from Drag Race

08:28.875 --> 08:30.710
who doesn't have my back.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.579
Well, maybe one.

08:32.579 --> 08:33.947
Okay, we need names,
darling.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.081
Call 'em out.

08:35.081 --> 08:36.282
Tell us more about Jaymes.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.284
[all laugh]

08:38.284 --> 08:40.754
RuPaul: Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.722
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

08:42.722 --> 08:45.892
the judges and I
will deliberate.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.696
Oh, me, oh, my.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.864
Hello, I'm home!

08:50.864 --> 08:52.298
-Hi!
-Hi!

08:52.298 --> 08:54.300
I'm ready for my cock
and my tail.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.269
Aah! Look out!

08:56.269 --> 08:57.904
Go sit that flower-padded ass
down, bitch.

08:57.904 --> 09:00.039
-Yes.
-Hurry up and sit down!

09:00.039 --> 09:01.674
What's the tea, sis?

09:01.674 --> 09:02.776
I know I'm in the bottom three.

09:02.776 --> 09:03.777
I don't know, like,
where I'm landing,

09:03.777 --> 09:04.911
if I'm lip syncing or not.

09:04.911 --> 09:07.847
Ava Max said she really,
really loved my outfit.

09:07.847 --> 09:09.282
She said she'd wear this
while performing,

09:09.282 --> 09:10.617
which, like,
made me feel really good.

09:10.617 --> 09:11.618
Huh.

09:11.618 --> 09:12.886
They say basically

09:12.886 --> 09:14.854
what you guys have been
saying to me, essentially--

09:14.854 --> 09:16.322
That you talk too much?

09:16.322 --> 09:18.658
Yes, yeah, I think
Michelle said that.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.293
So then you need to fix it.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.529
Like, try to show yourself
in a different light.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.030
A good one.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.565
Uh-oh.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.200
-Ooh.
-Orion.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.335
-What'd they say?
-I'm in the bottom.

09:29.335 --> 09:30.670
Bottom three or bottom two?

09:30.670 --> 09:31.971
-Bottom two, I think.
-Oh, really?

09:31.971 --> 09:33.773
I kind of feel like
the way they edited it, though,

09:33.773 --> 09:36.342
like, they put all of my scenes,
like, at the beginning.

09:36.342 --> 09:38.678
Didn't you guys
do a storyboard?

09:38.678 --> 09:39.779
Yeah, but, like--

09:39.779 --> 09:41.047
And it was supposed
to be spread out?

09:41.047 --> 09:42.348
I think, like, the way
everything was structured,

09:42.348 --> 09:43.850
like, the scenes were
where they were supposed to be.

09:43.850 --> 09:46.286
Yeah, I mean, that's the point
of the storyboards.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.254
I don't know if that's
what I would blame it on.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.790
-I don't know.
-I'm just saying.

09:50.790 --> 09:51.791
Like, that's why
we have a storyboard,

09:51.791 --> 09:53.059
is so we have something
to follow.

09:53.059 --> 09:54.360
Yeah.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.496
What did they think
of your look, though?

09:56.496 --> 09:58.998
They liked it, and they're,
like, it's not Spring, though.

09:58.998 --> 10:02.602
And I'm like, bitch, where?

10:04.170 --> 10:05.171
Do you think this gives Spring?

10:05.171 --> 10:06.773
Yes, I do.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.341
Okay.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.476
Live for your fantasy,
you know what I mean?

10:09.476 --> 10:11.244
Angie, what'd they say
about you?

10:11.244 --> 10:13.813
All of my critiques
were really, really good.

10:13.813 --> 10:15.081
Well, you out of everyone

10:15.081 --> 10:17.684
have been in the top
this entire competition.

10:17.684 --> 10:18.685
We want you to go home.

10:18.685 --> 10:19.919
Oh!

10:19.919 --> 10:21.888
[laughs] I'm just kidding,
I'm just kidding.

10:21.888 --> 10:24.157
Ha ha ha!

10:24.157 --> 10:25.825
Camden, what did they say
about you, sis?

10:25.825 --> 10:28.828
Well, I think I'm in the top.

10:28.828 --> 10:30.597
[cheering]

10:30.597 --> 10:33.366
Seriously, it feels so crazy
to even just say that.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.400
That you're a top?

10:34.400 --> 10:35.535
No one would believe you.

10:35.535 --> 10:37.070
I know, no one believes it.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.905
Miss Bosco,
what about you, sis?

10:38.905 --> 10:40.640
They really liked me.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.641
[cheering]

10:41.641 --> 10:43.843
I'm kind of like
on cloud nine.

10:43.843 --> 10:45.478
Like, this feels
really, really neat.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.813
Whoa, on cloud nine.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.182
I know.
I'm so fucking funny.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.684
Hilarious!

10:51.684 --> 10:53.953
So from what you guys were
saying, it seems very similar.

10:53.953 --> 10:55.855
What about a first double win?

10:55.855 --> 10:59.225
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

10:59.225 --> 11:01.127
Can I, like, interject?

11:01.127 --> 11:02.695
Because, like, I am so happy

11:02.695 --> 11:05.532
my sisters in my group
are in the top.

11:05.532 --> 11:08.067
I just wanna know
what I need to do better.

11:08.067 --> 11:10.770
And I'm not gonna pull
a Jasmine and cry about it.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.105
Yeah!

11:12.105 --> 11:14.374
Daya Betty, she's been safe,

11:14.374 --> 11:17.176
and she's not comfortable
with that.

11:17.176 --> 11:20.747
But instead of putting more work
into what she's doing,

11:20.747 --> 11:23.716
she looks like what she's doing
is screaming for attention.

11:23.716 --> 11:25.418
Seriously, and I'm not just
being, you know, whatever--

11:25.418 --> 11:27.554
-A bitch.
-Oh.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.523
I just wanna know
what the fuck I need to do more.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.092
You are doing very
over-the-top characters.

11:33.092 --> 11:34.527
It's like a characterization,

11:34.527 --> 11:36.529
like, a caricature
of, like, whatever you're doing.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.965
Like, I get that, and I know,
but it's fucking drag!

11:38.965 --> 11:43.102
Jorgeous, what about you, sissy?

11:43.102 --> 11:46.739
They did say that my performance
was, um, kind of flat.

11:46.739 --> 11:48.708
I feel like
I'm just not bringing it,

11:48.708 --> 11:51.477
like, enough in the challenges,

11:51.477 --> 11:55.148
and it just makes me feel
disappointed in myself.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.850
Jorgeous, if you have to
lip sync, bitch, you know--

11:57.850 --> 12:00.653
you know that is where
you fucking shine.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.922
Bitch, you gonna turn it
the fuck out, yes, ma'am.

12:02.922 --> 12:05.491
Yes, and I'm just--I'm ready.

12:05.491 --> 12:08.661
Like, I am not shocked
that I'm in the bottom,

12:08.661 --> 12:11.965
but I think Jasmine
is definitely safe.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.266
You think so?

12:13.266 --> 12:14.601
Yes.

12:14.601 --> 12:15.768
But, like,
you never know, though,

12:15.768 --> 12:17.103
so, like, I feel like
it's me and you

12:17.103 --> 12:18.171
interchanging in the part.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.572
Like, all tea, baby,
I love you,

12:19.572 --> 12:22.508
but they read you more on
your acting and on your look

12:22.508 --> 12:23.843
-compared to me and Jorgeous.
-Yeah.

12:23.843 --> 12:29.782
You guys, I know that
we got letters from Kornbread.

12:29.782 --> 12:30.917
-Yes.
-Miss Bread.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.518
Can we do this?

12:32.518 --> 12:34.921
Can everybody just
raise their drink for me?

12:34.921 --> 12:36.356
-Pour one out.
-Kornbread!

12:36.356 --> 12:38.124
-Kornbread!
-Kornbread!

12:38.124 --> 12:39.125
I love you, Bread!

12:39.125 --> 12:40.660
-Dr. Bread.
-we love you, baby.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.695
I was really touched
by my note. It meant a lot.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.030
She said, "Fuck you," huh?

12:44.030 --> 12:47.166
She was, like, the wake-up
call that I needed.

12:47.166 --> 12:48.368
Do you understand
where she was coming from--

12:48.368 --> 12:50.103
-Absolutely.
-Do you, though?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.305
No, I do, seriously.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.807
Because I know at first
you were very much just, like,

12:54.807 --> 12:56.576
in one ear and out the other.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.744
But did you absorb it?

12:57.744 --> 12:59.946
Like, I--like, I--

12:59.946 --> 13:02.448
You better be honest, bitch.
I'll punch you in your face.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.784
No, I know. I think I was
absorbing it in the challenge.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.052
Didn't fully get it.

13:06.052 --> 13:07.887
When they announced
that she left,

13:07.887 --> 13:09.022
I think right then and there

13:09.022 --> 13:11.157
was the moment
when I was like, oh, my God.

13:11.157 --> 13:12.525
So it took that moment
for you to fully realize.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.260
-Yeah, to fully realize.
-Okay.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.795
I'm very thankful
that she said that.

13:15.795 --> 13:16.996
I mean, apply it,

13:16.996 --> 13:19.132
and it's only gonna make
the people around you

13:19.132 --> 13:20.266
love you even more.

13:20.266 --> 13:21.768
Yeah.

13:21.768 --> 13:22.969
It's hard for me,

13:22.969 --> 13:26.572
because Kornbread
was, like, a rock for me.

13:26.572 --> 13:28.741
We got close very, very quickly

13:28.741 --> 13:31.811
because we both have
a lot of darkness in our past,

13:31.811 --> 13:33.079
and it's something

13:33.079 --> 13:36.249
that sometimes feels
impossible to deal with.

13:36.249 --> 13:40.186
I just--I miss her so much,
and it hurt me yesterday.

13:40.186 --> 13:42.622
That was my lowest moment
in this competition so far

13:42.622 --> 13:45.491
was when we realized
she was gone,

13:45.491 --> 13:46.726
and I was like, I feel fucked.

13:46.726 --> 13:48.528
Right.

13:48.528 --> 13:49.962
If there's anything, like,
I knew about Kornbread,

13:49.962 --> 13:52.632
it was don't fuck
with Willow.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.334
-Don't fuck Willow.
-That's my baby!

13:55.334 --> 13:57.870
She definitely had, like,
this big attachment towards you.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.072
Yeah, and we really thought

13:59.072 --> 14:00.540
it was gonna be her and me
to the end,

14:00.540 --> 14:03.876
and now I'm, like,
it's just gonna be me.

14:03.876 --> 14:05.044
[all laugh]

14:05.044 --> 14:07.547
Y'all gonna have me tear up
again on this.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.449
-Good.
-Do it.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.118
Girl, I don't know
if I can get through this.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.586
Don't be scared of emotions.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.621
When I first got the call
to come here,

14:15.621 --> 14:16.956
I did feel
a little uncomfortable

14:16.956 --> 14:19.392
because it can take me
a while to open up.

14:19.392 --> 14:22.295
And when I walked in
and I saw her...

14:24.597 --> 14:28.634
I just instantly felt home,
and I felt seen.

14:28.634 --> 14:32.472
In L.A., Kornbread and I,
we know each other

14:32.472 --> 14:34.974
forwards, backwards,
inside out, and into heaven.

14:34.974 --> 14:38.611
So we really have, like,
a kindred sister spirit.

14:38.611 --> 14:42.081
She's there to...
Uh, Jesus.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.450
She spent so much energy.

14:44.450 --> 14:46.085
Sometimes she didn't
even have it to give,

14:46.085 --> 14:48.554
and she still gave it
to all of us.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.090
-Mm-hmm.
-It really does kinda hit

14:51.090 --> 14:52.759
when you think about
the absence of her.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.961
And it really felt like
a lifeline was gone,

14:54.961 --> 14:56.863
because I felt so comfortable.

14:56.863 --> 14:58.865
I felt like
I had such a safe place.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.967
-Yeah.
-She saw things in some of us

15:00.967 --> 15:02.969
that I feel like many of us
didn't see in ourselves.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.370
-Yeah.
-For sure.

15:04.370 --> 15:07.707
And now it's our time to step
into what she knew we had,

15:07.707 --> 15:10.443
and to really do her that honor.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.845
Whew.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.247
Ladies, five minutes.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.281
Five minutes to main stage.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.949
-Okay!
-Whoo!

15:16.949 --> 15:18.785
-One more time for Kornbread!
-For Miss Bread.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.019
Is this that vulnerability
y'all wanting?

15:20.019 --> 15:21.654
Mickey Mouse crying
on a couch, bitch.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.456
Come on, bitch.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.996
It's way too early
for me to go home.

15:29.996 --> 15:33.699
I'm just so angry,
and I'm ready to fight.

15:33.699 --> 15:35.902
I really need
to get out of my head

15:35.902 --> 15:37.703
and stop doubting myself.

15:37.703 --> 15:40.206
This is my dream,
and I need to stay here

15:40.206 --> 15:41.574
till the bitter end.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.579
So let's get lit,
let's get rowdy, bitch.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.247
Let's fucking battle it out.

15:48.247 --> 15:49.749
[as if from afar]
Jorgeous?

15:49.749 --> 15:51.517
Jorgeous? Sister?

15:53.553 --> 15:55.955
Whatever happens,
you guys know that I love you.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.356
Oh, yes.

15:57.356 --> 15:58.958
And this does not define
who you are,

15:58.958 --> 16:00.293
no matter the outcome.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.594
And know that you guys
are here for a reason,

16:01.594 --> 16:02.995
and you guys
aren't going anywhere.

16:02.995 --> 16:06.632
Okay? So turn it out and show
the world what you can do.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.068
And I told her, if we're in
the bottom, don't hold back.

16:09.068 --> 16:10.937
-Don't hold back.
-Same two forever.

16:10.937 --> 16:13.005
-Uh-huh.
-Period.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.578
All right, ladies, time
for the main stage. Follow me.

16:18.578 --> 16:19.879
Oh, no. Aah!

16:19.879 --> 16:21.480
Oh, oh, we leaving.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.816
Come on, you guys.

16:26.452 --> 16:28.454
Huh? Oh, leave the werkroom.

16:28.454 --> 16:29.889
Oh, we're leaving
already. Ugh.

16:32.525 --> 16:33.793
RuPaul:
Welcome back, ladies.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.895
I've made some decisions.

16:36.963 --> 16:38.865
Orion Story.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.633
Jorgeous.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.201
The time has come

16:42.201 --> 16:45.171
for you to lip sync

16:45.171 --> 16:48.307
for your life!

16:51.477 --> 16:55.748
Orion, sashay away.

16:57.383 --> 16:59.185
Y'all got it the first time.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.087
[all laugh]

17:03.756 --> 17:05.725
There's so many emotions

17:05.725 --> 17:07.460
going through my head
right now.

17:07.460 --> 17:12.398
I'm just feeling
so disappointed in myself.

17:12.398 --> 17:16.736
But I'm so proud of everything
that I did while I was here.

17:19.338 --> 17:21.207
[sighs]

17:22.475 --> 17:26.679
Oh, I forgot about the notes.

17:29.181 --> 17:33.386
"Dear Orion, I'm excited to see
where this journey takes you,

17:33.386 --> 17:36.255
"and ecstatic
to call you a sister.

17:36.255 --> 17:39.992
There's always a couch for you
to sleep on in Seattle. Bosco."

17:41.594 --> 17:43.963
Gonna make me cry.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.401
Oh, Jorgeous.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.603
"I am so, so, so sorry.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.038
"Out of everybody,

17:52.038 --> 17:54.740
"I really did not want to be
in the bottom with.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.710
"Not gonna lie,
I have a little crush on you

17:57.710 --> 18:00.646
"from the moment I met you.

18:00.646 --> 18:05.084
You better keep in contact
with me. Jorgeous."

18:05.084 --> 18:07.420
They're gonna make me cry.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.122
I'm not trying to cry right now.

18:10.122 --> 18:12.792
Oh, my gosh.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.094
I love them all so much.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.633
I'm glad I got to show
more of myself.

18:20.633 --> 18:25.304
I'm not the same person
that I was when I came in,

18:25.304 --> 18:28.007
and I'm like, I'm grateful
for that, you know.

18:28.007 --> 18:29.442
I feel like if anything,

18:29.442 --> 18:34.213
I'm leaving with, like,
a newfound sense of self.

18:34.213 --> 18:36.082
I feel so much more
confident now.

18:36.082 --> 18:39.118
I'm not gonna sit here and mope

18:39.118 --> 18:40.653
that I didn't
take the crown home,

18:40.653 --> 18:43.789
but I'm so proud,

18:43.789 --> 18:44.957
and I know
that everyone back home

18:44.957 --> 18:46.058
is gonna be proud of me.

18:51.263 --> 18:52.832
Oh.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.737
I'm gonna miss
this room so much.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.672
Oh.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.374
I don't wanna leave.

19:01.374 --> 19:04.377
I'm gonna hide in the back.
They won't find me.

19:08.280 --> 19:12.351
This experience
has changed my life,

19:12.351 --> 19:16.655
so I'm just excited
for the future.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.525
Ooh.

19:19.525 --> 19:23.262
Hasta la vista.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.364
