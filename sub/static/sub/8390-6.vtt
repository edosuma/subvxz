00:07.490 --> 00:09.242

00:40.210 --> 00:43.179
HONEY, I HAVE TO WASH
MAX'S BANDANA.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.313
- HUH?

00:44.350 --> 00:45.556
IF HE'S GONNA BE A PIRATE,

00:45.590 --> 00:47.171
AT LEAST HE'S GONNA BE
A CLEAN PIRATE.

00:47.210 --> 00:48.723
IT'S LIKE RING
AROUND THE NECK.

00:48.770 --> 00:50.385
OH, MY GOD, AND HIS
BEHAVIORAL AIDE IS GONNA BE HERE

00:50.420 --> 00:52.047
AT 10:00,

00:52.080 --> 00:53.490

00:53.530 --> 00:55.179
I HAVE A THOUSAND QUESTIONS
THAT I WANT TO ASK HER,

00:55.220 --> 00:56.323
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

00:56.360 --> 00:58.601
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU

00:58.640 --> 00:59.982

01:00.020 --> 01:01.009
- UH...

01:01.060 --> 01:02.049
REALLY GETTING ME MAD.
SHE DOESN'T EVEN, LIKE,

01:02.090 --> 01:03.842
CARE ABOUT IT.
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, HEY.

YEAH.
CHOP-CHOP. LET'S GO.

01:17.070 --> 01:18.344
JUST MEET ME DOWNSTAIRS.

01:18.380 --> 01:20.268

01:20.320 --> 01:23.380
WITH SOMEONE LIKE ME?

01:23.420 --> 01:24.864
- NICE?

01:27.190 --> 01:29.112
- WHY DOES SCHOOL START
SO EARLY?

01:29.150 --> 01:31.254
8:30, SO DUMB.

01:31.290 --> 01:32.769
AND MONDAY.
WHY NOT START TUESDAY?

01:32.810 --> 01:35.222
- SHOULDN'T WE BE
THE ONES COMPLAINING, NO?

01:35.260 --> 01:36.773
- WELL, I'M JUST SAYING,
WHY START ON MONDAY?

01:36.820 --> 01:38.321
WHY NOT START ON TUESDAY?
- CAN YOU PULL OVER UP HERE?

01:38.370 --> 01:40.224
- WHY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- JUST STOP RIGHT HERE, PLEASE.

01:40.270 --> 01:42.602
- SCHOOL'S OVER THERE.

01:42.650 --> 01:44.470
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I'M SO EMBARRASSING

01:44.510 --> 01:46.307
THAT I CAN'T DROP YOU OFF
IN FRONT OF SCHOOL?

01:46.340 --> 01:48.228
- KIND OF.

THAT'S SO WEIRD.

01:55.350 --> 01:57.830

01:57.870 --> 01:59.667
both: BYE.

02:05.050 --> 02:07.154

- HI.

02:12.640 --> 02:13.846
- HEY.

02:13.890 --> 02:15.812

02:15.850 --> 02:17.647
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:17.680 --> 02:20.240
I GOT THE RESULTS
OF THE PATERNITY TEST.

02:20.270 --> 02:23.137
I DIDN'T REALLY WANT
TO OPEN IT BY MYSELF.

02:23.170 --> 02:25.752
- OH.
- SO MAYBE YOU COULD HELP OUT.

02:25.800 --> 02:29.008
- THAT'S REALLY SWEET,
AND IT'S ALSO KIND OF PATHETIC.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.076
HERE.
- THERE'S NO PICTURES OF ME

02:31.110 --> 02:32.338
AT ALL
IN THIS WHOLE OFFICE.

02:32.390 --> 02:34.073
YOU'RE EMBARRASSED TO HAVE ME
IN THE FAMILY?

02:34.110 --> 02:36.044
- OH, BY THE WAY,
I GOT YOU AND JABBAR

02:36.080 --> 02:38.116

WEDNESDAY PLAYGROUP.

02:38.150 --> 02:38.946
- WAIT, YOU GOT US IN?

02:38.980 --> 02:40.629
- THERE'S
A THREE-MONTH WAIT LIST.

02:40.670 --> 02:41.489
- FOR A PLAYGROUP?

02:41.540 --> 02:43.087
- HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA TAKE?

02:43.120 --> 02:44.849
COME ON, OPEN IT.
- WELL, I MEAN,

02:44.880 --> 02:47.223
CAN'T WE WORK UP TO IT?
- CAN YOU--OPEN IT.

02:47.270 --> 02:48.988
- WHAT ARE YOU--WHAT ARE YOU
IN SUCH A HURRY FOR?

02:49.030 --> 02:50.918
- ARE YOU AFRAID OF BEING
A FATHER OR NOT BEING A FATHER?

02:52.120 --> 02:52.120
- YES, BOTH.

02:52.170 --> 02:53.990

02:54.030 --> 02:55.543

OPEN IT.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.142

HE'S MINE.

03:18.090 --> 03:21.059

03:25.480 --> 03:28.165

I MEAN, WHAT'S THE--
I GOT TO BUY A MICROWAVE

03:32.550 --> 03:36.179
AND MOVE TO THE SUBURBS?

03:36.210 --> 03:38.132
OH, MY GOD, WE GOT TO TELL
MOM AND DAD.

03:38.180 --> 03:40.341
- YES, YOU DO.

03:40.390 --> 03:41.834
- NO, WE'LL GO TOGETHER,
YOU AND I.

03:41.870 --> 03:43.007
- GROW UP.

03:43.050 --> 03:45.621
- GROWING UP MEANS ASKING
FOR HELP, WHICH I'M DOING.

03:45.670 --> 03:47.001
- OH, THAT'S
VERY MATURE OF YOU,

03:47.050 --> 03:48.631
BUT ALSO GROW UP
AND DO IT YOURSELF.

03:48.670 --> 03:50.592
- I DON'T THINK YOU'VE READ ONE
OF THOSE BOOKS.

03:50.640 --> 03:51.800
I THINK THAT'S ALL FOR SHOW.

03:51.850 --> 03:53.499
- [chuckles]
GOOD LUCK.

03:53.540 --> 03:55.087
- YOU WANT TO FRAME THIS
FOR YOUR OFFICE?

03:55.130 --> 03:57.815
'CAUSE THIS MIGHT BE THE
DOCUMENT THAT MADE ME GROW UP.

03:57.850 --> 03:58.919
IT WOULD LOOK GREAT HERE.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.473
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANT ANY PICTURES OF ME,

04:00.510 --> 04:01.886
SO MAYBE JUST THIS.

04:01.930 --> 04:03.238
- YOU'LL BE FINE!

04:05.240 --> 04:07.060
- HI, I'M GABY.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.965

04:34.820 --> 04:36.788
[clears throat] I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN.

04:36.820 --> 04:37.787
THERE'S SO MANY THINGS.
I MEAN...

04:37.820 --> 04:40.027
- WELL, IF THERE WERE
A BEHAVIOR OF MAX'S

04:40.070 --> 04:43.164
YOU COULD WAVE A WAND
AND CHANGE, WHAT WOULD IT BE?

04:43.210 --> 04:45.678
- HOW MUCH WOULD A WAND
LIKE THAT COST?

04:45.730 --> 04:47.698
- OH, GOSH,
IN THE MORNINGS,

04:47.730 --> 04:50.142
IT TAKES HIM A REALLY LONG TIME
TO GET READY,

04:50.180 --> 04:51.522
LIKE, A REALLY LONG TIME.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.801
- HIS DIET--
HE'S GOT A VERY LIMITED DIET.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.183
HE'LL ONLY EAT CERTAIN THINGS,
COOKED IN CERTAIN WAYS.

04:56.220 --> 04:58.905
- RIGHT, LIKE, HE'LL ONLY EAT
EGGS IF THEY'RE COOKED

04:58.950 --> 05:00.156
IN THE ORANGE FRYING PAN.

05:00.190 --> 05:03.364
- THAT SORT OF BEHAVIOR NORMAL
FOR A KID WITH ASPERGER'S?

05:03.400 --> 05:05.083
- THE ORANGE FRYING PAN
IS NEW.

05:05.130 --> 05:08.258
- OH, IT'S WEIRD,
EVEN FOR A KID WITH ASPERGER'S.

05:08.300 --> 05:11.121
GREAT.
- AND HE HAS TAN--TANTRUMS,

05:11.170 --> 05:14.139
TEMPER TANTRUMS,
SOMETIMES SEVERE.

05:14.170 --> 05:16.206
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I'D CALL THEM SEVERE.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.105
- BITING, THE FISH TANK.
- ALL RIGHT.

05:18.140 --> 05:19.869

05:19.900 --> 05:22.004
- OKAY, TELL ME--
HOW'S HE DOING SOCIALLY?

05:22.040 --> 05:25.908
DOES HE HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS?
DOES HE HAVE PLAYDATES?

05:25.940 --> 05:27.805
- NO.

05:27.840 --> 05:28.807
- NO?

05:28.840 --> 05:33.083
- MAX DOESN'T REALLY HAVE
ANY FRIENDS.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.320
- OKAY.
WHY DON'T WE START THERE?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.058
- THAT'S GOOD.

05:45.860 --> 05:48.829
- MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

ALL COME TRUE

05:51.310 --> 05:53.551

06:10.920 --> 06:12.808
MAY YOU
ALWAYS KNOW THE TRUTH

06:12.850 --> 06:15.398
AND SEE THE LIGHT
SURROUNDING YOU

06:15.440 --> 06:18.091
MAY YOU
ALWAYS BE COURAGEOUS

06:18.130 --> 06:20.166

MAY YOU STAY

06:27.070 --> 06:29.891
FOREVER YOUNG

06:33.490 --> 06:35.833
- A HORNED LIZARD CAN SQUIRT
BLOOD FROM ITS EYES.

06:35.870 --> 06:38.737
THE ARMADILLO LIZARD CAN CURL
ITSELF UP INTO A TIGHT BALL

06:38.770 --> 06:40.351
TO PROTECT ITSELF
FROM A'I'I'ACK.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.595
[alarm beeps]
THE SUNGAZER LIZARD HAS SPIKES

06:42.640 --> 06:43.538
THAT COVER ITS WHOLE BODY.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.709
AND LOTS OF LIZARDS
CAN CHANGE COLORS.

06:45.750 --> 06:47.251
- THAT'S VERY COOL, MAX.

06:47.300 --> 06:50.155
SO WE'VE BEEN DOING
WHAT YOU WANT FOR 20 MINUTES.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.713
IT'S TIME
TO TRY ONE OF MY GAMES.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.058
- NO WAY.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.749
- HEY, MAX, BE POLITE.

06:54.790 --> 06:57.190
- MAX, YOU GET TO CHOOSE
WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.377
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:58.410 --> 06:59.650
HE DOESN'T LIKE BOARD GAMES
AT ALL.

06:59.690 --> 07:00.725
- OKAY.
- WE'VE TRIED.

07:00.760 --> 07:01.681
- WHEN YOU MAKE A DEAL,

07:01.730 --> 07:03.823
HE HAS TO HOLD UP
HIS END OF THE BARGAIN.

07:03.870 --> 07:05.349
- OKAY.

07:05.390 --> 07:06.550
- ALL RIGHT, MAX,

07:06.590 --> 07:09.241
CHECK THIS OUT.

07:09.290 --> 07:11.861
- COOL.
- THIS IS THE DEAL, OKAY?

07:11.910 --> 07:14.458
- EVERY MINUTE YOU PLAY
ONE OF THESE GAMES,

07:14.500 --> 07:15.660
YOU GET A STICKER.

07:15.710 --> 07:18.110
I HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM
IN MY BAG HERE, ALL RIGHT?

07:18.160 --> 07:21.391
SO YOU GET UP TO 20 STICKERS,
CASH THEM IN,

07:21.440 --> 07:22.941

07:22.990 --> 07:24.366
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

07:24.400 --> 07:27.164
- HOW ABOUT
I GET THE BOOK FIRST,

07:27.200 --> 07:28.508
THEN WE PLAY THE GAME?

07:28.550 --> 07:30.757

'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:30.790 --> 07:34.658
I USED TO ALWAYS WANT MY DESSERT
BEFORE MY DINNER,

07:34.690 --> 07:37.796
AND IT ALWAYS TURNED OUT
I HAD TO HAVE MY VEGGIES FIRST,

07:37.830 --> 07:38.751
SO...

07:38.800 --> 07:40.552

07:51.600 --> 07:53.044
THE REWARD IS THE BOOK.
- I WANT THE BOOK.

07:53.090 --> 07:54.398
- SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO PLAY A GAME.

07:54.430 --> 07:56.500

08:00.510 --> 08:02.853
THAT'S OKAY.

NOTHING HERE IS GONNA CHANGE

08:04.930 --> 08:07.160
UNLESS YOU PUT GUACAMOLE
BACK IN THE CAGE.

08:08.590 --> 08:10.683
YOU MAKE THE CHOICE.

08:12.590 --> 08:16.037

08:37.060 --> 08:39.233
I KNOW I DIDN'T SEEM
VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT IN CLASS,

08:39.270 --> 08:42.751
BUT I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF--IF YOU WERE STILL TRYING

08:42.790 --> 08:44.132
TO GET PEOPLE TO JOIN

08:44.170 --> 08:47.958

THINGY, THE SPECTRUM?

08:48.010 --> 08:50.319

THAT'S GREAT.

09:01.430 --> 09:02.397
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

09:02.430 --> 09:05.012
SO I GUESS THE NEXT STEP
IS WE ARE FORMATTING

09:05.060 --> 09:06.709
TOMORROW AFTER SCHOOL

IT WOULD BE NERDY AND LAME.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.639
- [laughs]

09:15.690 --> 09:17.783

09:40.710 --> 09:42.086

09:42.130 --> 09:44.098
- UM, I DON'T THINK SO.

09:44.130 --> 09:45.574
- WELL, I SHOULD WASH IT
SEPARATELY.

09:45.610 --> 09:46.850

WITH ALL THE OTHER TEES.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.164
- WELL, IT'S RED,
YOU KNOW.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.849

16:47.690 --> 16:50.443
ALL KIDS SHOULD HAVE

WITH THEM, HUH?

16:52.970 --> 16:54.619

17:28.180 --> 17:30.171
HE'S HAVING A BALL.
- MM-HMM.

17:30.220 --> 17:32.381

HOW YOU DID IT.

17:32.430 --> 17:35.729
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO DO THIS FOR SO LONG,

17:35.770 --> 17:37.419
AND I'M...

17:37.470 --> 17:39.563
I'M JUST AMAZED.

17:39.610 --> 17:42.181
DO YOU WANT A SNACK--
AN APPLE OR SOMETHING?

17:42.230 --> 17:43.913
I HAVE TONS.
- HOW ARE YOU?

17:43.950 --> 17:46.123

17:46.160 --> 17:48.025

17:59.490 --> 18:01.412
- YOU DID.

18:02.870 --> 18:04.451
- NONE OF THIS IS EASY,
YOU KNOW.

18:04.490 --> 18:06.355
- I'M SORRY.
I JUST FEEL LIKE A LOSER.

18:06.390 --> 18:08.381
I FEEL LIKE A TOTAL LOSER.

18:08.430 --> 18:11.149
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO THIS
FOR SO LONG,

18:11.190 --> 18:13.397
AND YOU MAKE IT SEEM
SO EASY.

18:13.430 --> 18:16.638
I MEAN, JUST WATCHING...
- IT'S NOT.

18:16.680 --> 18:20.389
IT'S HARD, AND I ONLY WORK
WITH HIM A FEW HOURS A DAY.

18:20.440 --> 18:22.579
THIS IS YOUR LIFE,
YOU KNOW?

18:22.610 --> 18:24.305
- [sighing]
OH.

18:24.340 --> 18:25.546
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO IT.

18:25.580 --> 18:29.129
- I KNOW. I--
WELL, THAT'S WHAT NOBODY GETS.

18:29.170 --> 18:31.309
I TRY TO EXPLAIN...

18:31.350 --> 18:34.376
JUST THE WORRY--
THE WORRY NEVER GOES AWAY.

18:34.420 --> 18:36.866
LIKE, I-I FIND MYSELF
UP LATE AT NIGHT

18:36.900 --> 18:39.175
JUST WORRYING
ABOUT MAX, AND...

18:39.220 --> 18:41.666
IS THERE SOMETHING
WE SHOULD HAVE TRIED?

18:41.700 --> 18:43.349
SOMETHING WE SHOULD TRY?

18:43.390 --> 18:46.279
WHEN I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT HIM,
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE FACT

18:46.330 --> 18:47.490
THAT I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT HADDIE.

18:47.540 --> 18:49.223
AND WHEN I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT HADDIE--

18:49.260 --> 18:51.364
IT'S JUST LIKE IT NEVER STOPS,
YOU KNOW?

18:51.400 --> 18:53.539
ADAM AND I--
MAYBE WE GET A-A CHANCE

18:53.580 --> 18:55.844
TO SPEND SOME TIME ALONE,
JUST TOGETHER...

18:55.890 --> 18:57.573
- YEAH.
- SOME MIRACLE CHANCE.

18:57.610 --> 19:00.090
IT'S LIKE I CANNOT STOP
WORRYING LONG ENOUGH

19:00.130 --> 19:01.757
TO ENJOY ANYTHING--

19:01.790 --> 19:03.587
ANYTHING, LIKE A MOVIE

19:03.620 --> 19:05.759
OR A NICE DINNER
OR SEX, IF...

19:05.790 --> 19:08.554
OH, MY GOD, I'M SORRY.
I SHOULDN'T--

19:08.590 --> 19:10.444
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
- I'M SO SORRY.

19:10.490 --> 19:12.412
- IT'S OKAY.
- DON'T TELL HIM I SAID THAT.

19:12.460 --> 19:15.145
- I WON'T.
- 'CAUSE HE DOES SATISFY ME...

19:15.180 --> 19:16.977
- I'M SURE HE DOES.
- A LOT.

19:17.010 --> 19:18.216
HE'S GOT A GOOD ONE.

19:18.260 --> 19:20.979
[both laughing]

19:21.020 --> 19:23.113
OKAY.

19:23.160 --> 19:24.388
NEVER MIND.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.910

19:26.950 --> 19:28.121
- OH, MY GOD.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.640
- HONESTLY, YOU'RE TOO HARD
ON YOURSELF.

19:30.680 --> 19:34.639
YOU NEED TO JUST CUT YOURSELF
SOME SLACK AND RELAX.

19:34.690 --> 19:35.679
- OKAY.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.336
OKAY, THEN I'M GONNA GO
TO HAWAII,

19:38.380 --> 19:39.608

HOW ABOUT THAT?

19:48.770 --> 19:49.691
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK

19:49.740 --> 19:50.809
THAT THEY'RE GONNA SPRING
ANYTHING ON YOU.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.808
THE DEPOSITION IS NOW SET

ADAM'S A GOOD DAD.

20:27.770 --> 20:31.115
- WELL, YEAH, HE'S A GREAT DAD,
BUT HE'S NOT A ROCK STAR.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.252
JOEL...

20:46.720 --> 20:48.995

21:19.650 --> 21:21.754
HOW DOES ONE DEFINE FLIRTING
THESE DAYS?

21:21.790 --> 21:23.997

PROVIDING MULTIPLE BEVERAGES.

THE FIRST RULE OF PLAYGROUP

21:45.950 --> 21:47.599

21:47.650 --> 21:50.369
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND
ANOTHER SOURCE.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.126
- THAT'S COOL.
I GOT WHAT I NEED, CROSBY.

21:53.170 --> 21:54.091

23:17.910 --> 23:19.878

I WAS SO WRONG ABOUT HER.

23:19.910 --> 23:21.707

NUDGE-NUDGE ALL ABOUT?

23:29.470 --> 23:30.437
- WHERE?

23:30.470 --> 23:32.529

THE LITTLE "JUST RELAX TONIGHT"

23:32.580 --> 23:33.740
AND THE LITTLE...
- OH.

23:33.790 --> 23:34.927
- WINK SHE GAVE YOU THERE.

23:34.960 --> 23:37.827
- JUST HAD A LITTLE--
HAD A LITTLE MELTDOWN EARLIER,

23:37.860 --> 23:39.202
NOTHING BIG.

23:39.240 --> 23:40.400
- ARE YOU DOING OKAY?

23:40.450 --> 23:43.374
- I JUST, YOU KNOW, SORT OF
ENDED UP UNLOADING ON GABY

23:43.420 --> 23:45.820
ABOUT HOW STRESSED
I AM--WE ARE--

23:45.870 --> 23:47.076
AND HOW WORRIED I AM
ALL THE TIME

23:47.110 --> 23:51.046
AND HOW SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW,
IT'S HARD FOR US TO CONNECT

23:51.080 --> 23:52.149
IN CERTAIN WAYS,

23:52.180 --> 23:53.977
AND SHE WAS REALLY HELPFUL.

23:54.010 --> 23:55.216
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

23:55.260 --> 23:57.080
- HOW WHEN WE HAVE

23:57.120 --> 23:59.987
CERTAIN TIMES TOGETHER,
AND I CAN'T RELAX.

24:00.020 --> 24:01.942
- KRISTINA, WE'RE KEEPING
OUR PRIVATE LIFE PRIVATE, RIGHT?

24:01.990 --> 24:03.150
YOU'RE NOT TALKING TO HER
ABOUT SEX.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.122
- HONEY, OF COURSE.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.980
- KRISTINA, ARE YOU TALKING
TO HER ABOUT OUR SEX LIFE?

24:07.030 --> 24:08.474
- IT'S A NATURAL THING.

24:08.510 --> 24:11.684
IT WAS--IT CAME UP ONCE,
AND IT WAS JUST IT.

24:11.720 --> 24:12.823
SHE BROUGHT IT UP.

24:12.860 --> 24:14.612
- UH, WELL, WHAT--WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU TELLING HER?

24:14.660 --> 24:16.230
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT SAYING
THAT YOU'RE NOT ENJOYING IT.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.134
- NO. NO.

24:18.180 --> 24:19.272
WHY WOULD I TELL HER THAT?

24:19.310 --> 24:20.754
THAT'S SO DUMB.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.199
- BUT I MEAN,
YOU ARE, AREN'T YOU?

24:22.250 --> 24:23.558
I MEAN,
YOU'VE BEEN ENJOYING IT.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.977
- WILL YOU RELA--
- I'M RELAXED.

24:26.010 --> 24:28.046
- YES, I'M ENJOYING IT...
- UH-HUH. YOU'RE SATISFIED?

24:28.080 --> 24:29.763
- A LOT. YES.

24:29.810 --> 24:31.630
- YOU SURE?
- YES.

24:31.670 --> 24:32.773
- WAIT A MINUTE.

24:32.810 --> 24:34.084
- FEELING SEXY.
- WHAT'D YOU TELL HER?

24:34.120 --> 24:36.816
- WHAT'D I TELL HER WHEN?

24:36.850 --> 24:39.501
WHAT? WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

24:39.540 --> 24:41.223
I'M STARTING
TO GET SWEATY. WHAT?

24:41.270 --> 24:44.091
- HAVE YOU--HAVE YOU BEEN...

24:44.130 --> 24:45.233
FAKING IT?

24:45.270 --> 24:47.238
- [scoffs]

24:47.270 --> 24:49.579
- WELL,
THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.895
- I DID NOT SAY THAT.
- NO, CLEARLY.

24:51.930 --> 24:53.067
- I DID NOT SAY THAT.
- CLEARLY YOU HAVE BEEN.

24:53.110 --> 24:55.510
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
- HONEY, ONCE IN A WHILE, I DO.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.312
YOU KNOW, I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK--

24:57.350 --> 24:58.999
- I DON'T WANT YOU TO FAKE IT.
I WANT YOU TO HAVE,

24:59.040 --> 25:00.598
YOU KNOW, HEALTHY...
- I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK

25:00.630 --> 25:01.972
THAT I DON'T APPRECIATE
THE EFFORT.

25:02.010 --> 25:04.149
- THE EFFORT? WHAT,
LIKE IT'S A SCIENCE PROJECT?

25:04.190 --> 25:05.282
- 'CAUSE YOU DO A GOOD JOB.

25:05.330 --> 25:06.809
- I DON'T NEED YOU
TO COMFORT ME BY FAKING IT.

25:06.850 --> 25:07.976
- HONEY, I FEEL GOOD.

25:08.020 --> 25:09.009
WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN
AND EAT?

25:09.050 --> 25:11.610
OR DRINK? DRINK.
WHY DON'T YOU DRINK SOMETHING?

25:11.640 --> 25:13.528
- WHY WOULD YOU TELL HER
ABOUT THAT?

25:13.580 --> 25:15.639
- I--SHE LISTENED TO ME,
AND SHE OPENED UP.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.545
- SO JUST NOW, I MEAN,
JUST THIS--

25:17.580 --> 25:19.309
YOU WERE FAKING IT
JUST BEFORE.

25:19.340 --> 25:21.023
- HONEY,
UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.

25:21.070 --> 25:23.209
I FEEL BETTER TODAY
THAN I HAVE FELT IN SO LONG.

25:23.240 --> 25:26.129
- WHAT ABOUT THAT TIME AFTER
THE JON STEWART DAILY SHOW?

25:26.170 --> 25:28.172
THAT WAS PRETTY INTENSE.
THAT WAS THE REAL DEAL, RIGHT?

25:28.210 --> 25:29.757
- YEAH.

25:29.800 --> 25:30.824
- I MEAN, YOU WEREN'T FAKING IT
THEN, WERE YOU?

25:30.870 --> 25:33.077
- NO. I SWEAR.
- YOU SURE?

25:33.110 --> 25:34.793
- YEAH.
YEAH.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.838
- I JUST--YOU KNOW,
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO KNOW

25:38.880 --> 25:42.873
THAT YOU'RE REALLY SATISFIED.

25:46.710 --> 25:49.508
- WHOA.
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

25:49.540 --> 25:52.919
-IAM.

25:55.790 --> 25:58.588
CROSBY SAID HE HAD
A GOOD TIME AT THE PLAYDATE.

25:58.620 --> 26:00.963
- OH, YEAH.
YEAH, IT WAS FUN.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.104
- HE CALLED YOU A ROCK STAR.

26:03.140 --> 26:04.550
- REALLY?

26:04.590 --> 26:07.218
CROSBY SAID SOMETHING NICE
ABOUT ME, HUH?

26:07.250 --> 26:08.831
THAT'S A FIRST.

26:08.870 --> 26:11.668
- IN FACT, HE USED
THE WORD "WORSHIPPED."

26:15.330 --> 26:18.982
- WHY DOES THAT NOT SOUND
LIKE A GOOD THING?

26:26.200 --> 26:27.428
- DID RACQUEL HIT ON YOU?

26:27.480 --> 26:30.449
- IS THAT WHAT CROSBY SAID?

26:30.480 --> 26:31.515
- HE DIDN'T HAVE TO.
I INFERRED.

26:31.550 --> 26:33.927
- NO, SHE DID NOT HIT ON ME.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.008
SHE DIDN'T, I SWEAR.
JULIA--

26:38.040 --> 26:39.484
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
I HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT?

26:39.520 --> 26:40.555
THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT?

26:40.590 --> 26:42.797
- YEAH.
- SHE DIDN'T HIT ON YOU.

26:42.840 --> 26:46.389
- NO.
- SHE'S NEVER HIT ON YOU?

26:46.430 --> 26:47.829
JOEL.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.635
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

26:54.640 --> 26:56.608
NOTHING HAPPENED.

26:56.640 --> 27:01.293
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO,
SHE GOT A LITTLE, UM...

27:01.340 --> 27:03.501
AND H SHUT IT DOWN...

27:03.550 --> 27:04.619
TOTALLY.

27:04.650 --> 27:07.403
AND THAT WAS IT.

27:07.450 --> 27:10.487
- HOW COULD SHE--
HOW COULD--YOU'RE A FATHER.

27:10.520 --> 27:12.317
OUR DAUGHTERS
ARE BEST FRIENDS.

27:12.350 --> 27:13.829
HOW COULD SHE--
WHAT DID SHE DO?

27:13.870 --> 27:16.623
- HER HUSBAND
WAS OUT OF TOWN ON WORK.

27:16.660 --> 27:17.797
YOU WERE WORKING LATE.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.171
THE GIRLS FELL ASLEEP.

27:19.220 --> 27:21.495
AND, UH, I GUESS
SHE STARTED TALKING TO ME

27:21.530 --> 27:24.249
ABOUT TROUBLES
IN HER MARRIAGE,

27:24.290 --> 27:26.087
AND I LISTENED,

27:26.120 --> 27:28.259
AND SHE...

27:28.300 --> 27:30.461
SHE MISINTERPRETED.

27:30.510 --> 27:33.434
AND...
- AND WHAT?

27:38.130 --> 27:40.690
SHE KISSED YOU.

27:40.720 --> 27:43.587
JOEL, DID SHE KISS YOU?

27:43.620 --> 27:47.169
- SHE TRIED.
I STOPPED IT.

27:47.210 --> 27:49.201
END OF STORY.

27:52.530 --> 27:54.418
- WOW.

27:54.460 --> 27:56.007
WOW.

27:56.050 --> 27:58.189
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?

27:58.220 --> 28:01.428
- I DIDN'T WANT THINGS
TO GET WEIRD.

28:01.470 --> 28:04.223
- I THOUGHT I WAS INSANE
FOR BEING JEALOUS OF HER.

28:04.260 --> 28:06.125
YOU LET ME THINK
THAT I WAS INSANE.

28:06.160 --> 28:09.027
- HARMONY IS
SYDNEY'S BEST FRIEND, JULIA.

28:09.060 --> 28:11.335
- AND YOU'RE USING OUR DAUGHTER
AS YOUR EXCUSE

28:11.370 --> 28:15.022
FOR NOT TELLING ME?
- YEAH, BECAUSE IT'S THE TRUTH.

28:21.760 --> 28:25.389
- OKAY.

28:25.420 --> 28:26.864
OKAY.

28:26.910 --> 28:30.311
I DON'T WANT THAT WOMAN
IN OUR LIVES.

28:30.360 --> 28:33.284
- OH, COME ON, JULIA.
- IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?

28:33.330 --> 28:36.322
- [sighs]

28:36.360 --> 28:39.193
YOU TAKE AWAY RACQUEL,
YOU TAKE AWAY HARMONY,

28:39.230 --> 28:40.845
AND OUR DAUGHTER IS LEFT
WITHOUT HER BEST FRIEND.

28:40.890 --> 28:42.198
- OUR DAUGHTER
IS FIVE YEARS OLD,

28:42.230 --> 28:43.674
AND SHE WILL MAKE
NEW FRIENDS, RIGHT?

28:43.720 --> 28:45.540
- COME ON.
- WHAT IF I WAS AT WORK

28:45.580 --> 28:47.753
EVERY DAY
WITH A GUY WHO HIT ON ME?

28:55.420 --> 28:57.866
OKAY?

29:03.220 --> 29:05.359
- SO, UM...

29:05.390 --> 29:08.666
DO YOU WANT TO TELL SYDNEY,
OR SHOULD I?

29:08.710 --> 29:11.042
- I'LL TELL HER.

29:15.230 --> 29:18.336
- [mutters softly]

29:19.750 --> 29:22.753
- I'LL TELL HER TOMORROW.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.758
- SORRY.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.200
- THANK YOU.
OKAY.

29:41.220 --> 29:42.255
- HI.
- HEY.

29:42.290 --> 29:43.632
- HI.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:43.670 --> 29:44.466
- NOTHING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:44.500 --> 29:46.081
- DROPPING THIS STUFF OFF
FOR DAD.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.439
- OH, YEAH?
- WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

29:47.470 --> 29:48.983
- OH, GOD,
I DON'T KNOW.

29:49.020 --> 29:50.362
CROSBY WENT SOMEWHERE
WITH MOM AND DAD,

29:50.400 --> 29:51.537
AND DREW'S AVOIDING ME
LIKE ALWAYS,

29:51.580 --> 29:53.855
AND AMBER'S REALLY, REALLY LATE
COMING HOME FROM SCHOOL.

29:53.890 --> 29:57.405
AND SHE'S PROBABLY SMOKING
OR DRINKING OR...

29:57.450 --> 30:00.021
[sighs] STEALING SOMETHING.
I DON'T KNOW, SO...

30:00.070 --> 30:01.549
- HAVE YOU EVER FAKED
AN ORGASM?

30:01.590 --> 30:02.796
- WHAT?

30:02.830 --> 30:04.138
- JUST ADDRESS
THE QUESTION, PLEASE.

30:04.180 --> 30:05.340
- I DON'T KNOW
THAT IT'S A QUESTION

30:05.380 --> 30:06.244
I WANT TO ANSWER.
- YOU'RE MY SISTER.

30:06.280 --> 30:07.861
JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION,
WOULD YOU?

30:07.900 --> 30:10.107
- NO, I HAVEN'T HAD TO.

30:12.250 --> 30:13.353
- COOL.

30:15.430 --> 30:17.182
- WAIT, WAIT,
WHY--WHY ARE YOU ASKING?

30:17.220 --> 30:18.289
- NO REASON.

30:18.330 --> 30:19.228
- OH, NO, NO.

30:19.260 --> 30:21.364
- ALL RIGHT,
I'M OUT OF HERE.

30:21.400 --> 30:23.504
- UNLESS--NO, NO, WAIT.
I'M JUST KIDDING.

30:23.540 --> 30:24.677
OF COURSE I HAVE.

30:24.710 --> 30:26.405
AND--AND IF SOMEONE IN YOUR LIFE
HAS, THAT'S OKAY TOO.

30:26.440 --> 30:27.646
- WELL, YOU HAVE?
- YES, OF COURSE.

30:27.680 --> 30:29.124
EVERYBODY HAS.
- WELL, WHEN?

30:29.170 --> 30:30.649
- I DON'T KNOW.
A COUPLE DIFFERENT TIMES.

30:30.690 --> 30:31.645
- WHY?
- A COUPLE DIFFERENT REASONS.

30:31.690 --> 30:32.918
- WELL, CAN YOU NAME THEM?

30:32.960 --> 30:34.587
I MEAN, I DON'T--
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

30:34.620 --> 30:36.474
- [sighs]

30:36.520 --> 30:38.340
IT'S LIKE...

30:38.380 --> 30:40.132
WE DON'T WANT YOU
TO FEEL BAD.

30:40.180 --> 30:42.410
- GOD, THIS IS JUST HORRIBLE.
- IT'S NOT HORRIBLE.

30:42.460 --> 30:43.722
- WHAT, ARE YOU ALL IN ON THIS?
- IT'S NOT HORRIBLE.

30:43.770 --> 30:44.976
WE'RE NOT ALL IN ON IT.

30:45.010 --> 30:46.238
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD YOU,
FIRST OF ALL.

30:46.290 --> 30:47.666
THAT BREAKS THE CODE
RIGHT THERE.

30:47.700 --> 30:48.735
- WELL, HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO TELL?

30:48.770 --> 30:50.738
- YOU CAN'T TELL, HONEY.
IT'S FAKE.

30:50.770 --> 30:53.466
SORRY.
- WELL, I DON'T GET IT.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.536
I REALLY DON'T GET IT.
I MEAN, WHY FAKE IT AT ALL?

30:55.570 --> 30:57.709
- 'CAUSE IT'S TOO LONG
TO EXPLAIN IN THE MOMENT.

30:57.750 --> 30:59.889
IT'S LIKE YOU JUST KIND OF,
YOU KNOW,

30:59.920 --> 31:03.617
PUT ON A HAPPY FACE AND JUST,
YOU KNOW, BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME.

31:03.650 --> 31:05.129
- BUT IT'S A LIE.
IT'S AN ACT.

31:05.170 --> 31:06.444
- YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT A LIE.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.515
IT IS AN ACT,

31:07.550 --> 31:09.825
BUT IT'S AN ACT
OF--OF SOMETHING POSITIVE.

31:09.860 --> 31:11.612
IT'S--IT'S AN ACT
OF GENEROSITY.

31:11.660 --> 31:12.797
IT'S A GIFT.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.240
A GIFT?
- YES.

31:14.280 --> 31:15.588
- HOW--HOW IS FAKING IT
A GIFT?

31:15.630 --> 31:17.313
- BECAUSE IT SAYS TO YOU,

31:17.350 --> 31:19.409
"THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TRYING.

31:19.460 --> 31:21.212
"PLEASE COME AGAIN SOON.

31:21.250 --> 31:22.877
COME AGAIN AS SOON
AS YOU POSSIBLY"--

31:22.910 --> 31:24.559
both: HI.
- HEY.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.113
- UH, OKAY, THANKS.

31:26.160 --> 31:27.661
JUST TELL DAD SHOES,
LIGHTBULBS...

31:27.710 --> 31:28.870
- SO COME BACK AGAIN
NEXT TIME,

31:28.920 --> 31:31.127
AND I'LL JUST GIVE
HIM THOSE. OKAY.

31:31.160 --> 31:33.082
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
- SCHOOL.

31:33.130 --> 31:34.529
- [scoffs]
WHERE WERE YOU?

31:34.580 --> 31:35.467
JUST TELL ME.

31:35.510 --> 31:36.954
- I WAS SERIOUSLY
AT SCHOOL THIS TIME.

31:36.990 --> 31:39.550
- DOING WHAT?
- EXT RA-CREDIT STUFF.

31:39.580 --> 31:40.649
I WAS, UH,

31:40.690 --> 31:42.237
FORMATTING IN THE COMPUTER LAB,
IF YOU MUST KNOW.

31:42.270 --> 31:43.373
- I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THAT.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

31:43.410 --> 31:46.038
- IT'S EXTRA CREDIT
FOR SCHOOL, OKAY?

31:46.070 --> 31:48.823
MR. CYR, MY ENGLISH TEACHER.
- OH. FOR MR. CYR?

31:48.870 --> 31:50.826
- YEAH.
- OH, THAT'S GREAT.

31:50.870 --> 31:52.383
- YEAH.
- EXTRA CREDIT, THAT'S GOOD.

31:52.420 --> 31:53.796
- YEAH, NO BIG DEAL.
- NO, I KNOW.

31:53.840 --> 31:56.422
I'M JUST--I'M...

31:56.460 --> 31:57.381
I-I-I'M PROUD OF YOU.

31:57.430 --> 31:59.807
YOU KNOW, EXTRA CREDIT,
THAT'S EXTRA.

31:59.840 --> 32:01.467
- OKAY.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

32:01.500 --> 32:04.469
- DON'T BE WEIRD.
- I'M NOT WEIRD.

32:23.250 --> 32:25.514
- LITTLE SCOOP OF ICE CREAM.
- RIGHT.

32:25.560 --> 32:27.903
- YOU KNOW, LIKE...
- YOU WANT IT 50/50.

32:27.940 --> 32:29.623
- AT LEAST 50/50.
- YEAH, YEAH.

32:29.670 --> 32:31.490
MAYBE EVEN MORE ICE CREAM.

32:31.530 --> 32:32.667
- PRETTY GOOD.
- HEY, THIS IS ON ME.

32:32.700 --> 32:34.019
- HUH?

32:34.050 --> 32:36.154
- I GOT--I GOT THIS.
I GOT THIS ONE.

32:36.190 --> 32:37.805
- THAT'S UNPRECEDENTED.

32:37.850 --> 32:39.249
- IT'S MY WAY
OF SAYING THANK YOU

32:39.300 --> 32:41.120
FOR ALL THE NICE THINGS
YOU GUYS DO FOR ME.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.468
- THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU.

32:42.510 --> 32:45.786
- OH, MAN,
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

32:45.820 --> 32:48.300
CAN YOU FLOAT ME 40...
DAD, DAD.

32:48.340 --> 32:50.615
I'M KIDDING. I'M--I'M KIDDING.
- REALLY?

32:50.650 --> 32:52.402
- YEAH, I HAVE IT.

32:52.450 --> 32:55.681
LISTEN, YOU KNOW, THE--THE
CARE PACKAGES AND THE LAUNDRY

32:55.730 --> 32:58.381
AND THE BOAT REPAIRS, I KNOW
YOU THINK I TAKE IT FOR GRANTED,

32:58.420 --> 33:00.479
BUT I DON'T.
I APPRECIATE IT.

33:00.530 --> 33:02.248
I REALLY DO.

33:05.560 --> 33:06.629
- YOU FEELING OKAY?

33:06.670 --> 33:08.592
- YEAH.
I FEEL GREAT.

33:08.640 --> 33:11.564
I ALSO WANT TO SAY
THAT I'M NOT GONNA BE

33:11.610 --> 33:13.259
SUCH A BURDEN ANYMORE
TO YOUR GUYS.

33:13.300 --> 33:17.054
- WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY
YOU'VE BEEN A BURDEN.

33:17.090 --> 33:19.331
- DEFINE BURDEN.

33:19.370 --> 33:20.951
- I'VE BEEN WORKING MORE HOURS,

33:20.990 --> 33:23.026
AND I'VE BEEN--I'VE BEEN
PUTTING AWAY SOME CASH.

33:23.070 --> 33:25.641
I'M PREPARING FOR, UH...

33:25.690 --> 33:27.203
THE NEXT STAGE IN MY LIFE.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.800
- CROSBY, YOU'RE STARTING
TO SCARE THE HELL OUT OF ME.

33:29.830 --> 33:31.343

33:56.130 --> 33:58.473
THAT'S A LITTLE ROUGH.
- WELL, YOU CALL HER THAT.

33:58.510 --> 34:00.580

FROM A FEW YEARS AGO

34:00.620 --> 34:02.542
WHO'S A DANCER,

34:02.590 --> 34:04.649
AND SHE WAS TOURING
THE BAY AREA,

34:04.690 --> 34:08.035
AND WE HAD SOME FUN.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.763
AND YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT DANCERS.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.449
- SHE'S AN EXOTIC--
- NO, SHE DOESN'T DANCE

34:11.490 --> 34:14.288
WITH A POLE.
SHE'S LIKE--YOU KNOW, BALLET.

34:14.320 --> 34:17.289
ANYWAYS, LOOK, I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE GOT PREGNANT.

34:17.330 --> 34:20.458

35:23.190 --> 35:24.384

THE NAME DOESN'T MATTER.

35:35.400 --> 35:36.981
- WHAT'S HIS LAST NAME?
IS IT BRAVERMAN?

35:37.030 --> 35:38.748
IT BETTER BE BRAVERMAN.

35:38.790 --> 35:40.234
JABBAR BRAVERMAN?

36:12.230 --> 36:13.606
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

36:13.650 --> 36:17.404
MAYBE IT WAS A LITTLE...
TOO COMPLICATED.

36:17.450 --> 36:20.578
I MEAN, THREE OPTIONS IS A LOT
OF OPTIONS.

36:20.620 --> 36:22.201
THAT'S...

36:22.240 --> 36:24.800
THAT'S OVERWHELMING.

36:24.830 --> 36:26.138
I UNDERSTAND.

36:26.180 --> 36:30.287
I'M JUST NOT GOOD
WITH MULTIPLE CHOICE.

36:30.320 --> 36:32.424

ARE RIDICULOUS.

36:34.460 --> 36:36.325
MAYBE--
WHAT THE HELL'S THAT?

THAT'S NOT A REAL CHOICE.

36:37.950 --> 36:39.156
