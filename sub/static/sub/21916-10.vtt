00:08.316 --> 00:10.451
It's them,
the kids who disappeared!

00:10.519 --> 00:13.020
Crystal Cove High's
Mystery Solver's Club,

00:13.088 --> 00:14.589
Mystery, Incorporated.

00:14.656 --> 00:17.124
Like, these kids were
just like us.

00:18.927 --> 00:20.495
Darrow University library?

00:20.562 --> 00:23.865
This looks like the entire
history of Crystal Cove.

00:23.932 --> 00:27.034
The Darrow family, who disappeared,
along with their mansion,

00:27.102 --> 00:30.438
nearly 75 years ago
without a trace.

00:30.506 --> 00:32.339
"Don't give up.

00:32.408 --> 00:34.776
This has all happened before."

01:08.577 --> 01:12.012
Well, here we are, family,
the Burlington library.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.715
Aw, this is going to be
the greatest vacation ever.

01:14.783 --> 01:17.552
Where have I heard that before?

01:19.154 --> 01:20.455
I mean, how exciting is it

01:20.522 --> 01:22.089
we're spending
our entire winter vacation

01:22.157 --> 01:24.992
at some old dead,
rich guy's library, huh?

01:25.060 --> 01:26.561
Learning is awesome.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.096
Learning is lame.

01:34.503 --> 01:35.937
Hi, there.
Hope you don't mind.

01:36.004 --> 01:38.172
We just kind of
let ourselves in.

01:52.888 --> 01:56.190
Learning isn't lame, it's evil!

02:30.717 --> 02:41.135
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:44.873 --> 02:47.241
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

02:57.318 --> 02:59.854
After everything
we've been through lately, gang,

02:59.922 --> 03:02.023
this little ski vacation
is just the thing.

03:02.090 --> 03:04.458
Like, Scoob and I aren't as
crazy about hitting the slopes

03:04.526 --> 03:07.695
as we are about hitting the massive,
all you can eat fondue bar!

03:07.763 --> 03:10.264
Fonduy-Dooby-Doo!

03:13.936 --> 03:16.370
Take the left fork.
The right is a dead end.

03:29.051 --> 03:33.955
I don't know, Velm. That left
fork seems pretty dead, too.

03:34.022 --> 03:37.124
The ol' Mystery Machine is
a little banged up down there.

03:37.192 --> 03:39.827
- We'll need to make some repairs.
- What's that?

03:39.895 --> 03:43.631
That terrifying mansion looks
warm and inviting.

03:48.570 --> 03:50.805
Does anybody else think
it's strange to find

03:50.872 --> 03:53.240
a huge mansion up here
in the middle of nowhere?

03:53.308 --> 03:54.609
At least the lights are on.

03:54.676 --> 03:56.176
Good enough for me.

04:01.316 --> 04:04.819
I'm freezing my paws off.

04:08.523 --> 04:11.092
Well, hello, there.

04:11.159 --> 04:14.294
You young folks come on in
out of that cold.

04:18.065 --> 04:20.101
Welcome to
the Burlington library.

04:20.168 --> 04:22.269
We're always open
to receive guests.

04:22.337 --> 04:24.005
Glad y'all found us.

04:24.072 --> 04:25.873
We're glad
we found you too, sir.

04:25.941 --> 04:27.775
Our van sure could use
some repairs.

04:27.843 --> 04:29.543
We were wondering
if we could spend the night.

04:29.611 --> 04:33.848
You can stay here
for the rest of your lives.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.085
Why couldn't we break down

04:38.153 --> 04:39.887
where the dude
who runs the joint didn't act

04:39.955 --> 04:41.889
like he wanted to eat
our livers?

04:41.957 --> 04:44.191
Shaggy, we're guests, remember?

04:44.259 --> 04:47.227
Guests? We're what's for dinner!

04:47.295 --> 04:52.299
Name's Dan Fluunk. I'm the
caretaker up here all year 'round.

04:52.367 --> 04:54.601
Plenty of room right now.
Only myself,

04:54.670 --> 04:58.405
the kind of creepy older lady that's
been staying with us a while,

04:58.473 --> 05:02.109
and the cook from an
unspecified culture, Don Fong,

05:02.177 --> 05:06.714
stay out of the way of Don Fong.
He's a bit, um, angry.

05:09.217 --> 05:11.118
You see what I mean?

05:12.921 --> 05:16.423
The man himself,
Oswald P. Burlington,

05:16.491 --> 05:19.193
baron of the ,
king of steel.

05:19.260 --> 05:20.695
Lord of steam.

05:20.762 --> 05:23.064
Back in the 1880s,
he decreed that

05:23.131 --> 05:24.999
his library should stay
open for visitors

05:25.067 --> 05:29.336
anytime day or night
forever and ever.

05:29.404 --> 05:31.438
If, for any reason,
the library was to close,

05:31.506 --> 05:35.910
it and all its contents would go
to Darrow University.

05:35.977 --> 05:38.612
These artifacts are priceless.

05:38.680 --> 05:42.917
My family and I have been
taking care of them for years.

05:42.984 --> 05:45.419
Who are these portraits of,
Mr. Fluunk?

05:45.486 --> 05:48.355
That's a curious question,
young lady.

05:48.423 --> 05:50.524
Mr. Burlington had
a fascination

05:50.592 --> 05:53.861
with groups of 4 people
and an animal.

05:53.929 --> 05:56.097
I have no idea why.

05:56.164 --> 06:01.435
It was some sort of mystery
he was trying to solve.

06:01.502 --> 06:04.538
Now, over here's something
really interesting...

06:04.606 --> 06:10.444
a statue of Mr. Burlingtons
pet orangutan, Mr. Peaches.

06:10.511 --> 06:12.646
Oh, they went
everywhere together.

06:12.714 --> 06:17.718
Adventure after adventure.
He loved his monkey.

06:19.054 --> 06:22.089
So, after that long trip,

06:22.157 --> 06:23.657
is anybody hungry?

06:23.725 --> 06:26.627
Like, man,
this place is massive!

06:26.694 --> 06:28.929
Nothing horrible in here.

06:28.997 --> 06:31.932
Now, you two young men get
yourselves anything you want to eat

06:32.000 --> 06:35.636
while I get you and your friends
settled in some rooms upstairs.

06:38.573 --> 06:42.076
Like, maybe that dude isn't
an evil liver-eater after all.

06:42.144 --> 06:45.980
So, where should
we start, buddy ol' pal?

06:46.047 --> 06:48.916
Oh, over there.

06:51.686 --> 06:54.855
Like, let's see if we can get
in on some of that action.

06:54.923 --> 06:56.456
- Mmm.
- Ahem.

06:56.524 --> 06:59.026
Um, excuse us.

07:23.718 --> 07:25.219
We heard screaming!

07:25.287 --> 07:26.854
What's wrong, you guys?

07:26.922 --> 07:30.191
Don Fong, horrible monster!

07:33.028 --> 07:35.495
Like...

07:35.563 --> 07:39.233
No way.
We totally trashed this place.

07:39.301 --> 07:42.102
What's going on?

07:50.468 --> 07:54.338
A strange phantasm of the cook
trashed the kitchen? Really?

07:54.406 --> 07:56.340
- It's true!
- Yeah!

07:56.408 --> 07:58.776
He had big eyes and sharp teeth

07:58.844 --> 08:01.179
and...

08:01.246 --> 08:02.947
I just came down
from Don's room.

08:03.015 --> 08:05.249
He told me he's been asleep
up there all night.

08:05.317 --> 08:06.918
Then, he threw a ham at me.

08:06.985 --> 08:09.887
Don may be a hostile foreigner
from an unspecified culture,

08:09.955 --> 08:11.522
but he's no liar.

08:11.589 --> 08:14.091
Look, dude.
We are telling the truth.

08:14.159 --> 08:16.460
We never lie
when it comes to food,

08:16.528 --> 08:18.262
even if it's being thrown
at us.

08:18.330 --> 08:20.198
It's late, and we're all tired.

08:20.265 --> 08:22.266
I don't know about you guys,
but I sure could use

08:22.334 --> 08:24.468
a hot shower and a soft bed.

08:24.536 --> 08:28.172
Are you guys crazy? Who could
sleep in a house full of books?

08:29.975 --> 08:31.242
Never mind.

08:31.310 --> 08:34.212
If you need me,
I'll be in the library.

08:34.279 --> 08:36.214
You go on upstairs, Daph.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.782
I want to see if I can get the Mystery
Machine up and running again.

08:38.851 --> 08:43.721
Scoob, I could use your nose to sniff
out any leaks in the fuel line.

09:29.501 --> 09:32.203
Hello?
Is someone there?

09:37.276 --> 09:39.277
As soon as this library is
under my control,

09:39.344 --> 09:41.112
all of that will change.

09:41.179 --> 09:44.282
Dean Fenk?
What is she doing here?

09:44.349 --> 09:48.852
Have all the paperwork ready.
I don't want any mistakes.

09:52.757 --> 09:55.326
She must be
the older creepy lady

09:55.394 --> 09:58.495
Dan Fluunk was talking about.

10:40.738 --> 10:43.307
Like, what's wrong, Daph?
Are you ok?

10:43.375 --> 10:45.443
Oh, Freddy, I'm so scared.

10:45.510 --> 10:47.578
Don't be afraid, Daphne.
I've got you.

10:47.645 --> 10:50.948
Fred, I...
I really missed you.

10:51.016 --> 10:53.784
Missed you holding me.

10:53.852 --> 10:55.586
Missed...us.

10:55.653 --> 10:57.254
Me, too.

10:57.322 --> 10:59.323
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

11:06.365 --> 11:09.400
All sniffed out underneath.

11:09.468 --> 11:13.204
Here, too, Scoob.
She's as good as new.

11:13.271 --> 11:14.972
Couldn't have done it
without you.

11:17.542 --> 11:20.544
It's cold!

11:20.612 --> 11:23.080
Even with
the Mystery Machine fixed,

11:23.148 --> 11:26.717
we still have to wait for the storm
to blow over before we go anywhere.

11:34.493 --> 11:38.962
I wish he'd quit doing that.
It's a waste of good food.

11:45.303 --> 11:47.371
Shaggy?

11:47.439 --> 11:49.240
- Shaggy?
- Don't worry, Scoob.

11:49.307 --> 11:50.607
He probably just fell asleep.

11:50.675 --> 11:52.410
But Shaggy never falls asleep

11:52.477 --> 11:55.346
before I read him
his bedtime story.

11:55.414 --> 11:57.981
Come on, Scoob.
You can sleep in my room.

12:05.157 --> 12:08.359
Like, Daphne,
you're so perfect,

12:08.427 --> 12:10.827
so beautiful.

12:10.895 --> 12:13.497
Oh, Freddy.

12:13.565 --> 12:15.732
Mmm.

12:39.058 --> 12:40.926
Shaggy?

12:40.993 --> 12:42.560
Shaggy?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.667
Scooby!

12:49.736 --> 12:51.103
Scooby-Doo!

12:51.170 --> 12:52.838
Shaggy!

12:59.912 --> 13:01.847
Huh?

13:04.183 --> 13:06.051
Ahh.

13:09.588 --> 13:11.556
Huh?

13:21.934 --> 13:24.502
Huh?

13:47.226 --> 13:49.060
Huh?

13:57.670 --> 13:58.837
Aah!

13:58.905 --> 14:02.240
Oh, jinkies!
Oh, jinkies! Oh, jinkies!

14:07.914 --> 14:09.948
Huh?

14:15.754 --> 14:18.790
Mr. P-P-P-Peaches!

14:32.705 --> 14:36.241
Help, help! Daphne, Fred,
Scooby, Shaggy...help!

14:36.309 --> 14:38.944
Velma!
Are you ok?

14:39.011 --> 14:41.646
G-ghost train!
Mr. Peaches!

14:41.714 --> 14:44.816
Burlington, Burlington!

14:44.884 --> 14:47.452
Shaggy!
Where's my Shaggy?

14:52.325 --> 14:56.161
It's...It's...horrible!

15:02.801 --> 15:05.303
Mm. Huh?

15:05.371 --> 15:06.804
Huh?

15:06.873 --> 15:08.240
Huh?

15:08.307 --> 15:11.977
Fred. Freddy.
Please, snap out of it.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.411
I swear, nothing happened.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.180
Like, nothing happened!

15:15.248 --> 15:19.584
Except for the most amazing kiss
of my entire life!

15:19.651 --> 15:21.819
Ohh, sorry. Not helping!

15:21.888 --> 15:23.521
Didn't say that.
Nothing happened.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.590
I thought Shaggy was you, Fred.

15:25.657 --> 15:27.158
Yeah, and I thought
I was you, too.

15:27.226 --> 15:29.361
Like, it was so cool
having muscles

15:29.428 --> 15:31.162
and a jaw and a chin.

15:31.230 --> 15:33.398
Like, a real chin!

15:33.465 --> 15:35.333
It's still not working.

15:35.401 --> 15:37.635
What if their minds
are permanently gone?

15:37.703 --> 15:38.803
How would we know?

15:38.871 --> 15:40.939
- Velma!
- Dude! Not cool.

15:41.007 --> 15:44.142
Fine. Why don't we just fix it
the old fashioned way?

15:44.210 --> 15:47.412
- Wake up! You're dreaming!
- Huh?

15:49.348 --> 15:51.549
- Whoa! Hey, gang, what's up?
- Phew!

15:51.617 --> 15:55.553
Wow. You guys would not believe
the crazy dream I had.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.956
Me, too. Yuck!

15:58.891 --> 16:00.392
Phew.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.028
Now that we're all back
to a state of total denial,

16:03.095 --> 16:05.196
can we please talk about
the clues?

16:05.264 --> 16:06.998
Do any of you remember
anything at all

16:07.066 --> 16:09.000
that will help us solve
this crazy mystery?

16:09.068 --> 16:12.003
Not really. I put wood on the
fire to heat the shower,

16:12.071 --> 16:13.805
and then,
everything went haywire.

16:13.872 --> 16:16.474
Like, that's weird. I was putting
wood on the fire in here

16:16.542 --> 16:18.243
a few minutes
before you came in.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.579
And there was a fire burning
in the kitchen earlier.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.416
Jinkies! I put wood
on the fire in the library

16:24.483 --> 16:26.217
right before Mr. Peaches came
to life

16:26.285 --> 16:28.053
and a ghost train came
rolling through.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.255
Then that's where we'll start.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.763
Just as I suspected.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.267
Gang, this isn't normal wood.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.102
It's called Terrorwood,

16:44.170 --> 16:46.737
a special tree that produces
terror-inducing daydreams

16:46.805 --> 16:49.107
and phantasms
from its smoke when burned.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.009
Which we all experienced.

16:51.077 --> 16:53.611
Some of those hallucinations
involved kissing the lips

16:53.679 --> 16:56.014
of an absolute angel.

16:56.082 --> 16:58.416
What? Shaggy,
what are you talking about?

16:58.484 --> 17:01.086
Oh! Sorry. Continue.

17:01.153 --> 17:03.021
Ancient shamen
used Terrorwood smoke

17:03.089 --> 17:05.357
in their rituals thousands
of years ago in the Amazon.

17:05.424 --> 17:08.026
But there's something else
I want you to see.

17:08.094 --> 17:10.627
Oswald Burlington had
a mystery-solving gang

17:10.695 --> 17:12.730
just like
Mystery, Incorporated,

17:12.798 --> 17:16.300
although he called his
the Benevolent Lodge of Mystery.

17:16.368 --> 17:20.305
Two guys, two girls,
and an animal mascot.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.806
Hmm?

17:23.242 --> 17:24.575
Someone's there.

17:24.643 --> 17:26.044
Who was it, Scoob?

17:26.112 --> 17:28.445
- Don Fong? - Dean Fenk?
- Dan Fluunk?

17:28.513 --> 17:31.282
Dean Funk...
I mean, Dan Fink.

17:31.350 --> 17:35.887
- Don Fong?
- No. Fink Dan Don Fink Flunk Fluke.

17:35.954 --> 17:37.122
Don't worry, Scoob.

17:37.189 --> 17:39.290
The use of
difficult phonetics aside,

17:39.358 --> 17:41.092
the villain could be
any one of them.

17:41.160 --> 17:45.163
But I think I know just how
to smoke out the right one.

17:48.234 --> 17:51.836
Oh, gee, gang. We do love
it here ever so much.

17:54.340 --> 17:59.077
Yes. The Burlington library
is like our home away from home.

17:59.145 --> 18:02.180
Like, we should stay here
forever.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.382
And ever, and ever.

18:06.085 --> 18:12.090
Let's go unpack and move in for
months and months and months.

18:48.694 --> 18:51.429
Well, other than the
tension wire being a little slow,

18:51.497 --> 18:53.798
I'd say that was
one perfect trap.

18:53.865 --> 18:57.668
Now, let's see who's really
behind all this Terrorwood smoke.

18:58.537 --> 19:01.372
Dan Fluunk?

19:01.440 --> 19:03.007
That doesn't make any sense.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.809
You seemed like the nicest guy.

19:04.876 --> 19:06.877
Why, Dan? Why?

19:06.945 --> 19:09.981
It's this place.
I can't take it!

19:10.048 --> 19:13.017
I've been here
since I was born.

19:13.085 --> 19:16.254
My family's been caretakers
of the Burlington mansion,

19:16.322 --> 19:19.257
and then, the Burlington
library, for generations.

19:19.325 --> 19:24.095
I was born here,
been here every day of my life,

19:24.163 --> 19:26.331
all alone up here
on this mountain,

19:26.398 --> 19:28.733
tending this darn library!

19:28.800 --> 19:30.535
But it always seemed
to be snowing,

19:30.603 --> 19:32.937
and I could never get warm.
Never!

19:33.005 --> 19:36.241
I hate the cold.
I hate the snow.

19:36.308 --> 19:38.876
But the library
could never be closed.

19:38.944 --> 19:42.247
I never got a vacation,
not one.

19:42.314 --> 19:46.618
I found out about the Terrorwood
when I accidentally burned some.

19:46.685 --> 19:51.623
So I decided to use it to scare away
anyone and everyone that came here.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.858
So eventually,
no one would come anymore,

19:53.925 --> 19:58.062
and I could close the place
forever and go someplace warm.

20:00.098 --> 20:01.799
And I would have done it, too,

20:01.867 --> 20:03.701
been somewhere warm by now,

20:03.769 --> 20:07.705
if it wasn't for you
meddling snow-bound brats.

20:09.275 --> 20:12.277
I don't mind going to prison.
Not one bit!

20:12.344 --> 20:14.779
At least I'll finally be
someplace warm!

20:19.218 --> 20:21.919
You know, Don Fong here
was only trying to warn you.

20:23.989 --> 20:27.392
Throwing meat is a sign of warning
in his unspecified culture.

20:27.459 --> 20:30.127
Luckily, I'm fluent
in all unspecified languages,

20:30.196 --> 20:31.563
and I understood.

20:31.630 --> 20:33.464
And we fell in love.

20:39.371 --> 20:41.639
And I love you, too, honey.

20:41.707 --> 20:43.841
Mmm.

20:47.079 --> 20:50.348
Dean Fenk, what's going
to happen to the library?

20:50.416 --> 20:52.417
Nothing.
I'm not changing a thing.

20:52.484 --> 20:53.951
I love this library as-is.

20:54.019 --> 20:56.921
It's my great honor
to preserve it for posterity

20:56.988 --> 21:00.024
under the protection
of Darrow University.

21:07.032 --> 21:10.335
That's odd. There's no one left
inside that could have done that.

21:10.402 --> 21:12.303
Do you recognize it, Dean Fenk?

21:12.371 --> 21:13.804
Yes, I do.

21:13.872 --> 21:17.342
It's an ancient tome on alchemy
by Bartemeo Magnus,

21:17.409 --> 21:20.945
alchemic magister to Holy
Roman Emperor King Charles V.

21:21.012 --> 21:24.782
Wait a second. Bartemeo Magnus
created the planospheric disc.

21:24.850 --> 21:26.784
The planospheric disc?

21:26.852 --> 21:28.786
And if I'm not mistaken,

21:28.854 --> 21:32.857
this book is
a 500-year-old user's manual.

21:51.377 --> 21:52.910
The Darrow family,

21:52.978 --> 21:56.681
aka the Mystery Fellowship.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.549
It's all happened before,
Velma.

21:58.617 --> 22:02.587
Now what you got to do
is figure out why.
