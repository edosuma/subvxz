WEBVTT

00:00.633 --> 00:03.031
Do not try what
you're about to see at home.

00:03.055 --> 00:04.976
<i>We're what you call experts.</i>

00:04.999 --> 00:06.833
<i>Ow!</i>

00:09.325 --> 00:12.828
On this all-at-sea
episode of "MythBusters"...

00:13.055 --> 00:15.016
Batten down the hatches

00:15.017 --> 00:18.818
because there's
"Deadliest Catch" chaos...

00:18.820 --> 00:19.919
Whoa! Heads up!

00:19.921 --> 00:22.705
As captains Johnathan and Scott...

00:23.035 --> 00:25.135
We're going to Alcatraz! They set us up!

00:26.104 --> 00:27.270
Team up to tackle

00:27.272 --> 00:29.239
some high jinks from the high seas.

00:29.241 --> 00:30.607
Fingers out of the way.

00:30.609 --> 00:32.741
First, Adam and Jamie get knotted...

00:32.744 --> 00:34.577
Killer loop de los muertos.

00:34.579 --> 00:36.212
Oh!

00:36.214 --> 00:38.348
As they reveal if an unraveling rope...

00:38.350 --> 00:39.949
There he goes.

00:39.951 --> 00:42.652
Is a one-way ticket
to the deep-blue sea.

00:42.654 --> 00:44.654
Oh! Oh!

00:44.656 --> 00:47.090
Son of a @#$% that's @#$% tough.

00:47.092 --> 00:48.258
Rogue wave!

00:48.260 --> 00:50.560
Then Kari and Tory stay awake
for science.

00:50.562 --> 00:52.128
I don't like this game anymore.

00:52.130 --> 00:54.397
Can a pattern of power naps...

00:54.399 --> 00:55.865
Ow!

00:55.867 --> 01:00.103
Really let you function twice
as well as no sleep at all?

01:00.105 --> 01:01.404
1, 2, 3.

01:01.406 --> 01:03.273
Oh, he broke the pot!

01:03.275 --> 01:05.742
Finally, the team ends with a bang...

01:05.744 --> 01:07.544
I like to call this the crab's revenge.

01:07.546 --> 01:11.981
In the Twitter tall tale
of the bomb-proof crab pot.

01:11.983 --> 01:14.250
In 3, 2, 1.

01:14.252 --> 01:16.252
Whoa!

01:18.823 --> 01:20.223
Who are the MythBusters?

01:21.926 --> 01:23.093
Adam Savage...

01:23.095 --> 01:24.394
It's scientific!

01:24.396 --> 01:26.029
And Jamie Hyneman.

01:26.031 --> 01:27.630
Quack, damn you.

01:27.632 --> 01:32.135
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:33.004 --> 01:34.337
Together with Kari Byron...

01:34.339 --> 01:35.739
Come to mama.

01:35.741 --> 01:36.740
Tory Belleci...

01:36.742 --> 01:38.341
Why are we doing this?

01:38.343 --> 01:39.776
And Grant Imahara.

01:39.778 --> 01:41.144
Oh!

01:41.146 --> 01:43.246
They don't just tell the myths.

01:43.248 --> 01:44.080
Oh!

01:44.082 --> 01:47.417
They put them to the test.

01:47.419 --> 01:51.419

01:55.467 --> 01:59.462
It's no myth that crab fishing
in the Bering Sea

01:59.464 --> 02:02.832
is the world's most dangerous business.

02:02.834 --> 02:04.501
I hope I don't regret my decision.

02:04.503 --> 02:05.902
But it's also a business

02:05.904 --> 02:09.405
that's spawned
many a tall ship tall tale.

02:09.407 --> 02:12.208
Yeah, baby. Yeah, baby.

02:12.210 --> 02:15.545
And to seek the truth,
two of their Captain Fantastics

02:15.547 --> 02:18.715
have set sail to "MythBusters" Central.

02:18.717 --> 02:21.684
Okay, San Francisco. Here we come.

02:21.686 --> 02:24.888
So, I hear you guys have
some fisherman fables for us.

02:24.890 --> 02:26.122
Indeed, we do.

02:26.124 --> 02:27.390
All right. What have you got?

02:27.392 --> 02:29.492
Well, first up, we have
what's called the killer loop.

02:29.494 --> 02:31.261
Oh, I think I know this one.

02:31.263 --> 02:33.062
The crab pot's going off
the side of the boat,

02:33.064 --> 02:34.865
and the rope that holds onto it
is paying out,

02:34.866 --> 02:36.099
and if you step in that loop,

02:36.101 --> 02:37.734
you get dragged all the way down.

02:37.736 --> 02:40.403
Exactly, but the last part's
what's crucial.

02:40.405 --> 02:42.939
We know by stepping on the line,
we can cause severe injury.

02:42.941 --> 02:44.674
Right, but if you
get caught in that loop,

02:44.676 --> 02:46.109
will it drag you
all the way to the bottom?

02:46.111 --> 02:48.278
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.847
They don't call it
"Deadliest Catch" for nothing.

02:52.450 --> 02:54.984
But is it true that stepping
into an uncoiling cable

02:54.986 --> 02:59.289
can really see you dragged
all the way to the seabed?

02:59.291 --> 03:04.027
Or is this a myth that's on the ropes?

03:04.029 --> 03:05.762
Remember this guy? Little Mini Buster.

03:05.764 --> 03:07.096
Last time you saw him,

03:07.098 --> 03:09.499
he was seated in the back seat
of a polycarbonate car

03:09.501 --> 03:11.601
being smashed into by a log.

03:11.603 --> 03:12.869
3, 2, 1.

03:12.871 --> 03:14.971
Bam!

03:14.973 --> 03:17.540
Now we're about to see

03:17.542 --> 03:19.876
if he can get dragged
over the side of a scale boat

03:19.878 --> 03:21.344
by a scale rope.

03:21.346 --> 03:22.679
But first, I need to build a scale boat.

03:22.681 --> 03:23.847
Aah!

03:23.849 --> 03:24.948
Yep.

03:24.950 --> 03:26.583
Plan "A" is to set sail with small scale,

03:26.585 --> 03:30.220
where Adam's crafting a craft with love.

03:30.222 --> 03:32.488
All right, if we're gonna
be honest with each other,

03:32.490 --> 03:33.857
it's pretty clear that all I needed

03:33.859 --> 03:35.091
was a board with a railing.

03:35.093 --> 03:38.494
But I decided to indulge
the old model maker in me.

03:38.496 --> 03:39.529
I don't <i>have to</i> do this.

03:39.531 --> 03:41.631
I'm doing it 'cause I enjoy it.

03:41.633 --> 03:45.168
I cut out some spars
to define the shape of the hull.

03:45.170 --> 03:46.336
It's looking good.

03:46.338 --> 03:48.104
The deck, I wood-planked it,

03:48.106 --> 03:49.806
even though I don't even know

03:49.808 --> 03:51.941
if fishing boats have wood-plank decks.

03:51.943 --> 03:54.043
I don't have
the heart to tell him,

03:54.045 --> 03:56.045
but crab boats are made out of steel.

03:56.047 --> 03:58.181
I wanted to tell
the whole story of the myth

03:58.183 --> 04:01.417
in the small-scale experiment,
so that's what I went and did.

04:01.419 --> 04:03.419
I think it's ready.

04:03.421 --> 04:05.521
The crabs go in the crab hold.

04:08.693 --> 04:10.526
With looks to die for...

04:11.696 --> 04:13.796
Yeah, I've gone
a little overboard.

04:13.798 --> 04:15.398
Show-off.

04:15.400 --> 04:20.737
It's time for the killer-coil
conundrum to cast off.

04:20.738 --> 04:23.373
So, can you be dragged off
the deck of a boat

04:23.375 --> 04:26.242
if you unwittingly step
in an uncoiling loop of rope?

04:26.244 --> 04:27.977
That's what this miniature rig
hopes to find out.

04:27.979 --> 04:30.313
I've got my miniature sailor,
my miniature boat,

04:30.315 --> 04:33.683
and my miniature coil of rope,
which I will unwind.

04:33.685 --> 04:35.351
How? By releasing this weight.

04:35.353 --> 04:37.020
This weight will go down, which will,

04:37.022 --> 04:38.888
through the pulley system,
pull on that rope.

04:38.890 --> 04:39.989
These are filled with lead,

04:39.991 --> 04:42.225
so they have some momentum behind them

04:42.227 --> 04:45.295
so that when they yank
on the foot of my guy,

04:45.297 --> 04:48.998
they actually pull him up
over the deck of the boat,

04:49.000 --> 04:50.700
theoretically, of course.

04:50.702 --> 04:52.368
So, that's the theory.

04:52.370 --> 04:53.670
Here's the practice.

04:53.672 --> 04:56.205
Adam winds a regular coil of cord,

04:56.207 --> 04:58.508
and Buster assumes the position.

04:58.510 --> 04:59.542
Nice.

04:59.544 --> 05:01.344
But will he be dragged up and over?

05:01.346 --> 05:02.178
All right, here we go.

05:02.180 --> 05:04.013
Killer loop de los muertos.

05:04.015 --> 05:05.481
Coiled like a spring.

05:05.483 --> 05:06.816
3, 2, 1.

05:08.185 --> 05:10.520
Whoa! It did not grab him.

05:10.522 --> 05:12.522
No, it didn't.

05:12.524 --> 05:14.123
Contrary to the myth,

05:14.125 --> 05:16.025
Buster's not even caught in the coil,

05:16.027 --> 05:18.194
let alone dragged
to the bottom of the sea,

05:18.196 --> 05:21.164
so the guys reset for test two.

05:21.166 --> 05:22.598
Killer loop of death.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.600
Isn't that sort of redundant?

05:24.602 --> 05:25.702
3, 2, 1.

05:29.341 --> 05:31.607
Nice move, Buster,
but it's not gonna help you.

05:31.609 --> 05:34.110
This time, the rope did catch Buster,

05:34.112 --> 05:36.579
but again, he stayed on deck.

05:36.581 --> 05:37.780
Will test three give them

05:37.782 --> 05:40.883
the man overboard that this myth needs?

05:40.885 --> 05:42.185
3, 2, 1.

05:42.853 --> 05:44.754
Whoa!

05:44.756 --> 05:46.089
Wait, wait. What's going on?

05:46.091 --> 05:48.291
Come on. Let go. Oh!

05:48.293 --> 05:49.926
That held onto him quite nicely.

05:49.928 --> 05:52.261
Totally did.

05:52.263 --> 05:54.998
So, that time, the rope
did coil around Buster's leg,

05:55.000 --> 05:57.200
and it formed a strong enough knot

05:57.202 --> 05:59.168
to pull him up and over the side.

05:59.170 --> 06:00.536
But with this spring coil,

06:00.538 --> 06:02.839
it's not happening every time,
by any means.

06:02.841 --> 06:05.008
However, there are other ways
to coil a rope,

06:05.010 --> 06:08.644
the most common being the
over-under technique, like this,

06:08.646 --> 06:11.314
and so that's what we're gonna try next.

06:11.316 --> 06:13.383
This over-under technique

06:13.385 --> 06:15.051
is used on some fishing fleets,

06:15.053 --> 06:16.986
but will it make a difference?

06:16.988 --> 06:19.188
All right, over-under coil.

06:19.190 --> 06:20.356
3, 2, 1.

06:22.126 --> 06:23.893
Oh!

06:23.895 --> 06:25.995
Oh, little Buster. Ow.

06:25.997 --> 06:27.063
Nice.

06:27.065 --> 06:29.198
Right under the water.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.934
Talk about a deadliest catch.

06:31.936 --> 06:34.337
- Look at that.
- No way.

06:36.573 --> 06:37.573
Whoa!

06:37.575 --> 06:38.841
That's a clove hitch.

06:38.843 --> 06:40.643
That's a right and proper clove hitch.

06:40.645 --> 06:43.112
There's no doubt
that with this new coil,

06:43.114 --> 06:45.515
Buster's got well and truly hitched,

06:45.517 --> 06:47.116
and for the first time,

06:47.118 --> 06:50.620
he's dragged all the way down
without a helping hand.

06:50.622 --> 06:53.990
And what's more, the four
following tests follow suit...

06:53.992 --> 06:55.191
Up and over.

06:55.193 --> 06:56.993
Right in the nuts.

06:56.995 --> 07:00.263
Which means it's time
for some expert opinion.

07:00.265 --> 07:01.597
So, based on the small scale,

07:01.599 --> 07:03.433
it looks like the rope
might just pull you

07:03.435 --> 07:04.967
all the way to the sea bed.

07:04.969 --> 07:06.169
Yeah, those knots looked really tight,

07:06.171 --> 07:08.137
especially that clove hitch.

07:08.139 --> 07:10.973
Well, so, now if we're gonna go
to full scale for added realism,

07:10.975 --> 07:13.176
do you think one of you guys could
curse like a sailor for me?

07:13.178 --> 07:15.378
Abso#$%@lutely, you @#$% @#$%.

07:15.380 --> 07:17.180
Perfect.

07:21.919 --> 07:26.589
Next up, a crustacean cat nap.

07:26.591 --> 07:27.790
All right, Johnathan,

07:27.792 --> 07:28.991
what kind of myth
do you have for us today?

07:28.993 --> 07:29.992
One of my favorites.

07:29.994 --> 07:31.327
You're not gonna like this much.

07:31.329 --> 07:32.595
It's about sleep deprivation.

07:32.597 --> 07:34.497
Sleep deprivation?

07:34.499 --> 07:37.533
Yeah. The myth is are you better
off staying up a full 30 hours?

07:37.535 --> 07:39.602
Or are you better off every 6 hours,

07:39.604 --> 07:40.837
take a 15- or 20-minute nap?

07:40.839 --> 07:42.605
You'll be way more alert
and double your performance.

07:42.607 --> 07:44.040
So, you're saying
if you take a nap

07:44.042 --> 07:45.475
every 6 hours for 20 minutes,

07:45.477 --> 07:48.010
you'll do twice as good
as if you didn't sleep at all?

07:48.012 --> 07:49.278
That's what I'm saying.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.982
So, I guess we can call that
a crab-pot power nap?

07:54.818 --> 07:57.353
In the crazy world of crabbing,

07:57.355 --> 08:02.158
it's normal practice to hit
the deck for a 30-hour shift.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.227
Oh, my God. This is crazy.

08:04.229 --> 08:07.630
But can a medley of micro-sleeps

08:07.632 --> 08:10.633
really let you do your duties
on the double?

08:12.203 --> 08:15.071
Got a leak in the engine room!

08:15.073 --> 08:17.039
All right, so, how about we build

08:17.041 --> 08:19.408
a "Deadliest Catch" inspired
assault course?

08:19.410 --> 08:20.977
It'll test our reaction time,

08:20.979 --> 08:22.678
our coordination, and our mental acuity.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.147
Aha!

08:24.149 --> 08:25.348
That would be awesome.

08:25.350 --> 08:26.983
We'll stay up for over 30 hours,

08:26.985 --> 08:28.484
run the course, see how we do.

08:28.486 --> 08:31.154
And then we'll stay up
for another 30 hours,

08:31.156 --> 08:32.655
run the course again, but this time,

08:32.657 --> 08:34.789
we'll take 20-minute naps every 6 hours

08:34.792 --> 08:36.958
and see if that doubles our performance.

08:36.961 --> 08:38.727
This would be better
if you did this obstacle course

08:38.730 --> 08:40.897
on a real boat,
because there's no escape.

08:40.899 --> 08:44.133
This is gonna be the worst myth ever.

08:44.135 --> 08:46.502
So, it's anchors aweigh

08:46.504 --> 08:49.071
as the team clears the decks
to the docks.

08:49.073 --> 08:52.642
This is the <i>Mako,</i>
an 83-foot-long fishing trawler

08:52.644 --> 08:54.877
docked here in the San Francisco Bay

08:54.879 --> 08:57.747
at the California Maritime Academy.

08:59.150 --> 09:02.585
There's no doubt
that the boat's the business.

09:02.587 --> 09:05.721
And here's how the assault
course is going to go down.

09:05.723 --> 09:07.423
Who's the man now, crab pot?

09:07.425 --> 09:09.458
First up, hook 'em and cook 'em.

09:09.460 --> 09:11.460
Now, an important job
for a crab fisherman

09:11.462 --> 09:13.796
is to be able to haul the pots
back up on the boat.

09:13.798 --> 09:15.831
The way they do that...

09:15.833 --> 09:19.302
Is they take a buoy attached
to a rope attached to the pot.

09:19.304 --> 09:20.970
Then they take a grappling hook,

09:20.972 --> 09:23.706
hook the rope,
and haul it onto the boat.

09:23.708 --> 09:25.741
- Oh!
- Whoo!

09:27.111 --> 09:29.912
Next is stop 2 at size matters.

09:29.914 --> 09:31.847
Now, we're going to get
a crab pot full of 30 crab.

09:31.849 --> 09:34.217
We're gonna have to size them and
sort them as quickly as possible.

09:34.219 --> 09:37.553
Anything under 7 inches,
got to throw it back.

09:37.555 --> 09:40.056
This is station number three,
the king of swing.

09:40.058 --> 09:42.391
Now, one of the biggest dangers
on board a boat

09:42.393 --> 09:45.494
is getting hit by an 800-pound crab pot.

09:45.496 --> 09:47.897
I made these out of PVC pipe,

09:47.899 --> 09:50.333
so they're significantly lighter
than the real thing,

09:50.335 --> 09:52.702
because Tory and Kari
are going to get hit by them,

09:52.704 --> 09:54.971
and it's their job to avoid them.

09:54.973 --> 09:56.772
But wait, there's more.

09:56.774 --> 10:00.576
And this is station number 4,
the bearing sea.

10:00.578 --> 10:02.778
Up here on the bridge,
Tory and Kari will be given

10:02.780 --> 10:04.814
a course heading and have to find it.

10:04.816 --> 10:06.983
Now, it sounds like
a simple enough task,

10:06.985 --> 10:08.251
but when you're tired,

10:08.253 --> 10:10.853
even the simplest things
become very, very difficult.

10:10.855 --> 10:13.756
So, we're gonna wrap it up here
with stop 5 out on the bow.

10:13.758 --> 10:15.625
Now, this is the steady-hand test.

10:15.627 --> 10:17.326
You move this crab along the buzzer.

10:17.328 --> 10:18.527
If you hit the side...

10:18.529 --> 10:20.129
...it buzzes.

10:20.131 --> 10:22.498
I guarantee you
this is gonna get more annoying

10:22.500 --> 10:24.400
as I get more tired
and a lot harder to do.

10:25.937 --> 10:28.704
So, there's five
different skill-set tests

10:28.706 --> 10:31.073
and two different rest routines.

10:31.075 --> 10:34.343
Kari and Tory can earn
20 points per task,

10:34.345 --> 10:35.811
but they'll lose points

10:35.813 --> 10:40.449
if their total task time takes
longer than seven minutes.

10:40.451 --> 10:43.319
But before the slumber games begin...

10:43.321 --> 10:44.720
Let's do this.

10:44.722 --> 10:47.857
The guys first want to set
a wide-awake benchmark,

10:47.859 --> 10:50.593
where both phony fisherman...

10:50.595 --> 10:52.628
Good shot!

10:52.630 --> 10:54.297
Start with a perfect pitch.

10:54.299 --> 10:55.631
Good job.

10:55.633 --> 10:57.800
Size matters is easily sorted.

10:57.802 --> 10:59.935
Man, they're all small this season.

10:59.937 --> 11:01.470
And king of swing is no obstacle.

11:01.472 --> 11:03.739
Okay, go. Go, go, go!

11:05.876 --> 11:07.443
Good work!

11:07.445 --> 11:10.112
While navigation
is predictably painful...

11:10.114 --> 11:11.247
All right, Tory,

11:11.249 --> 11:13.749
you hear that the crabbing
is good in Drakes Bay.

11:13.751 --> 11:17.119
What two major directions
are you going to travel?

11:17.121 --> 11:18.821
Um...

11:18.823 --> 11:20.056
That's where we're at now, right?

11:20.058 --> 11:21.023
Yeah.

11:21.025 --> 11:24.026
I'm going southwest.

11:24.028 --> 11:26.062
Southwest and northwest.

11:26.064 --> 11:27.563
Both... correct.

11:27.565 --> 11:28.497
Sail through.

11:28.499 --> 11:30.433
And with no shock in shock wave...

11:30.435 --> 11:32.635
Bet you've never seen a captain do this.

11:32.637 --> 11:34.003
The scores are in.

11:34.005 --> 11:35.604
And time.

11:35.606 --> 11:38.007
All right, 5 minutes and 50 seconds.

11:38.009 --> 11:39.642
It's my crab dance.

11:39.644 --> 11:41.577
Well, that's a crab dance.

11:41.579 --> 11:43.212
I love it. It's sideways.

11:43.214 --> 11:44.480
All right, how did she do?

11:44.482 --> 11:46.182
Kari, you got a perfect score.

11:46.184 --> 11:47.783
Nice work, Kari.

11:47.785 --> 11:49.218
So, when wide awake,

11:49.220 --> 11:54.557
our curious crabbers pass this
test hook, line, and sinker.

11:54.559 --> 11:59.295
But will they be so surefooted
after a sleepless night at sea?

11:59.297 --> 12:00.629
It's getting late.

12:00.631 --> 12:02.264
I'm not sure how I'm gonna stay up.

12:02.266 --> 12:03.532
There's no Internet,

12:03.534 --> 12:06.035
and there's a TV from, I think, 1970.

12:06.037 --> 12:08.204
But I do know how Tory's gonna stay up.

12:08.206 --> 12:09.305
I found this on the bridge.

12:11.775 --> 12:14.810
Still to come,
the team hits the high seas...

12:14.812 --> 12:16.846
You don't get a view like this
on my boat.

12:16.848 --> 12:21.550
As killer coil unwinds
with catastrophic consequences.

12:21.552 --> 12:23.619
Oh! Oh! Oh!

12:25.000 --> 12:31.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

12:32.427 --> 12:34.261
Rest in the Northwest

12:34.263 --> 12:36.530
is an understandably rare event.

12:37.765 --> 12:40.400
But is it true that a power nap

12:40.402 --> 12:44.705
can make you twice as able
a seaman as no sleep at all?

12:46.023 --> 12:48.091
To find out, Kari and Tory

12:48.093 --> 12:50.792
must first stay awake
for a 30-hour shift.

12:50.816 --> 12:53.601
Luckily, Tory's got plans.

12:53.603 --> 12:56.371
Now, we could sit here
and watch VHS tapes

12:56.373 --> 12:58.540
on this black-and-white TV
to try to stay awake,

12:58.542 --> 13:02.744
or we could use this...
a complete entertainment center!

13:02.746 --> 13:05.079
I got checkers.

13:05.081 --> 13:06.014
I got cards.

13:06.016 --> 13:07.549
You got a queen?

13:07.551 --> 13:09.250
I got all kinds of games.

13:09.252 --> 13:10.418
Whatever you want.

13:10.420 --> 13:13.788
Kari's over here making a collage.

13:13.790 --> 13:14.856
I don't know.

13:14.858 --> 13:16.057
Whatever it takes for her to stay awake.

13:16.059 --> 13:17.392
I'm not judging.

13:17.394 --> 13:20.261
The whole point here is
to stay awake for 30 hours.

13:20.263 --> 13:23.097
Indeed, but as the
clock ticks towards midnight,

13:23.099 --> 13:25.200
they're barely halfway through.

13:25.202 --> 13:27.268
I'm getting so tired.

13:27.270 --> 13:29.470
To say it's a long night...

13:29.472 --> 13:31.272
We should probably huddle to stay warm.

13:32.309 --> 13:34.108
I'm not that cold.
It's pretty good jacket.

13:34.110 --> 13:35.843
Would be an understatement.

13:35.845 --> 13:37.412
Quick, get the net. I got one.

13:37.414 --> 13:40.315
But eventually, dark gives way to day.

13:40.317 --> 13:42.650
But it ain't over yet.

13:42.652 --> 13:44.152
Wake up! Reveille! Reveille!

13:44.154 --> 13:46.487
Wake up! Wake up, maggots!

13:46.489 --> 13:48.156
What are we playing games for?!

13:48.158 --> 13:50.291
Let's go! Let's move! Move! Move!

13:50.293 --> 13:53.261
We are going to do
50 side-straddle hops.

13:53.263 --> 13:54.562
I'll count the cadence.

13:54.564 --> 13:56.164
- Yes, J.D.?
- Make it 100.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.266
Make it 100! That's a beautiful number.

13:58.268 --> 13:59.767
Ready, begin!

13:59.769 --> 14:02.570
Deputy Wilson
and his familiar friend...

14:02.572 --> 14:04.005
Wake up!

14:04.007 --> 14:06.874
Are specialists in keeping
tired troops attentive.

14:06.876 --> 14:08.776
J.D., what have we missed?!

14:08.778 --> 14:09.844
I think you missed push-ups.

14:09.846 --> 14:12.880
And under their expert encouragement...

14:12.882 --> 14:14.082
Are we hallucinating?

14:14.084 --> 14:15.283
Down! Down!

14:15.285 --> 14:18.186
The guys go
beyond the 30-hour limit.

14:18.188 --> 14:20.521
- That's one and a half!
- What's going on?

14:20.523 --> 14:23.858
Kari and Tory
have now been up for 32 hours.

14:23.860 --> 14:25.827
It's time to run our test again.

14:25.829 --> 14:27.795
Exact same parameters.

14:27.797 --> 14:29.397
Geez, it's bright out here.

14:29.399 --> 14:31.232
Slightly different
navigational questions.

14:31.234 --> 14:33.134
All right, let's do this.

14:33.136 --> 14:34.569
We're gonna see how they do.

14:34.571 --> 14:39.073
All right, Kari Byron, this is
your 32-hour test with no sleep.

14:39.075 --> 14:41.542
You ready? How are you feeling?

14:41.544 --> 14:43.177
Um...

14:43.179 --> 14:44.612
- Get it, tiger.
- Yeah.

14:44.614 --> 14:45.680
Okay. Here we go.

14:45.682 --> 14:48.683
In 3, 2, 1, go!

14:49.919 --> 14:51.319
With the timer started,

14:51.321 --> 14:53.488
Kari slings her hook...

14:53.490 --> 14:55.423
Miss. Not even close.

14:55.425 --> 14:58.226
But finds her coordination
has jumped ship.

14:58.228 --> 14:59.694
Miss!

15:00.629 --> 15:01.863
And miss.

15:01.865 --> 15:02.997
Zero points.

15:02.999 --> 15:04.032
<i>Aww! Aww!</i>

15:04.034 --> 15:07.068
Size matters resonates well.

15:07.070 --> 15:09.570
Okay. Go, go, go, go, go!

15:09.572 --> 15:12.340
But the ducking... not so much.

15:12.342 --> 15:13.341
Oh!

15:17.780 --> 15:19.314
Yeah, she died.

15:19.316 --> 15:20.682
She died about three times.

15:20.684 --> 15:24.519
In navigation,
Kari leads the way...

15:24.521 --> 15:26.754
What two directions are you traveling

15:26.756 --> 15:30.325
if you start at Angel Island
and travel to Point Reyes?

15:30.327 --> 15:32.360
Even if she is a little vague.

15:32.362 --> 15:34.595
Uh...

15:34.597 --> 15:39.801
So, you are going to go
that way and that way.

15:39.803 --> 15:41.469
No.

15:41.471 --> 15:43.271
Lastly, there's shock wave...

15:43.273 --> 15:44.872
1, 2.

15:44.874 --> 15:48.343
Where it's fair to say
Kari has a shocker.

15:48.345 --> 15:49.711
All right. Eight touches.

15:49.713 --> 15:52.046
Move on. Uh...

15:52.048 --> 15:53.281
Hmm.

15:53.283 --> 15:55.583
Come on, Kari! Time.

15:55.585 --> 15:58.252
All right, your time
was 7 minutes, 50 seconds.

15:58.254 --> 16:00.154
Nice work.

16:00.156 --> 16:03.491
Your score, however, was fairly dismal.

16:03.493 --> 16:06.160
The first time you did this,
you got a perfect score.

16:06.162 --> 16:08.596
This time around, you got a 27.

16:08.598 --> 16:11.099
Oh.

16:11.101 --> 16:14.402
Wow. 32 hours really affected you.

16:14.404 --> 16:15.737
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

16:15.739 --> 16:17.405
With no sleep at all,

16:17.407 --> 16:19.841
Kari scored well
in the mental challenges

16:19.843 --> 16:22.043
but poorly in the physical ones.

16:22.045 --> 16:25.847
And with a significant drop-off
in pace, her total tumbled.

16:25.849 --> 16:28.883
What will Tory's story be?

16:28.885 --> 16:31.152
All right, 32 hours. I'm ready.

16:31.154 --> 16:34.188
All right, let's do it.
Here we go, in 3, 2, 1, go!

16:35.792 --> 16:39.260
Like Kari before him,
Tory's first throw is a foul.

16:39.262 --> 16:40.561
Missed it. You can do it.

16:40.563 --> 16:43.431
But take two takes the target.

16:43.433 --> 16:45.400
He got it! He got it!

16:45.402 --> 16:48.903
So, when a person is exposed
to extreme sleep deprivation...

16:48.905 --> 16:50.271
Sort those crabs! I'm watching you.

16:50.273 --> 16:51.639
Sort those crabs!

16:51.641 --> 16:55.510
They experience reduced
physical and mental performance,

16:55.512 --> 16:57.345
and Tory's no exception.

16:59.382 --> 17:01.048
Whoa! @#$%.

17:01.050 --> 17:03.384
Nice.

17:03.386 --> 17:06.154
What's interesting is that unlike Kari,

17:06.156 --> 17:09.022
he did pretty well
at the physical challenges...

17:09.025 --> 17:11.259
How many minutes of longitude

17:11.261 --> 17:15.061
are between Point Reyes
lighthouse and Angel Island?

17:15.064 --> 17:18.866
Point Reyes lighthouse.

17:18.867 --> 17:20.401
How many points of what?

17:20.403 --> 17:23.438
But really struggled
with the brainpower tests.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.506
How many minutes of longitude

17:25.508 --> 17:30.378
are between Point Reyes
lighthouse and Angel Island?

17:30.380 --> 17:31.813
He not only found it hard

17:31.815 --> 17:34.182
to understand the navigation questions,

17:34.184 --> 17:36.617
but he also took a while to answer.

17:36.619 --> 17:38.553
Uh, let's see.

17:38.555 --> 17:45.293
I would say 10, 20...30?

17:45.295 --> 17:46.928
No. It's 35.

17:46.930 --> 17:49.430
And while
Tory's steady as he goes

17:49.432 --> 17:51.132
with the final physical test...

17:51.134 --> 17:53.067
All right. Minus one. That's great, man.

17:53.069 --> 17:55.269
Oh. Go, go, go!

17:55.271 --> 17:59.040
It's clear that sleep
deprivation has hit him hard.

17:59.042 --> 18:00.975
Done.

18:00.977 --> 18:02.143
9:30.

18:02.145 --> 18:04.479
Oh, man. That was tough.

18:04.481 --> 18:05.513
What's my score?

18:05.515 --> 18:07.882
34.

18:07.884 --> 18:09.217
I had a bit of a meltdown.

18:09.219 --> 18:11.352
The cabin bridge thing.

18:11.354 --> 18:14.522
Man, those extra hours
really took their toll.

18:14.524 --> 18:17.558
Yep, while Tory's
strengths and weaknesses

18:17.560 --> 18:19.961
were surprisingly different from Kari's,

18:19.963 --> 18:24.265
his snail-pace speed
meant his score was all at sea.

18:24.267 --> 18:26.400
But will a paltry power nap

18:26.402 --> 18:29.637
really let them both bounce back
on the double?

18:29.639 --> 18:31.405
Still to come.

18:31.407 --> 18:33.808
I like to call this the crab's revenge.

18:33.810 --> 18:37.512
A Twitter tall tale turns torpedo.

18:44.822 --> 18:46.422
Buckle up

18:46.424 --> 18:50.126
because it's "MythBusters"
meets "Deadliest Catch"...

18:50.128 --> 18:52.629
Killer loop de los muertos.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.597
Where Adam and Jamie have a myth

18:54.599 --> 18:56.833
that's grabbed them by the boot.

18:56.835 --> 18:58.968
Oh, little Buster. Ow.

18:58.970 --> 19:00.136
The small-scale tests

19:00.138 --> 19:01.638
are making it look pretty good
for this story.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.072
Yeah, but a heads up.

19:03.074 --> 19:05.608
We rarely ever use the old
under-over coil on a crab boat.

19:05.610 --> 19:07.076
Yeah, I figured that,

19:07.078 --> 19:08.611
which means that when we go full-scale,

19:08.613 --> 19:09.913
we'll start with a regular coil,

19:09.915 --> 19:11.447
and then only if that doesn't work

19:11.449 --> 19:13.183
will we go to the over-under.

19:13.185 --> 19:14.350
So, what's the plan?

19:14.352 --> 19:17.053
Well, I figure we need a boat,
a crab pot,

19:17.055 --> 19:18.388
a neutrally buoyant Buster,

19:18.390 --> 19:20.156
and enough monitoring equipment
to make sure

19:20.158 --> 19:21.591
that if he does go over the edge,

19:21.593 --> 19:24.027
does he also go all the way
to the bottom of the ocean?

19:24.029 --> 19:25.762
You make it sound so simple.

19:25.764 --> 19:27.130
It won't be.

19:27.132 --> 19:30.366
To the captains,
it may sound easy.

19:30.368 --> 19:31.834
I don't know about this.

19:31.836 --> 19:33.303
Ain't no crab in the bay.

19:34.973 --> 19:38.942
But the only thing calm about
this caper is the weather.

19:38.944 --> 19:41.277
Well, our small-scale
tests were very instructive,

19:41.279 --> 19:43.379
but I think it's time to stop
playing with toys,

19:43.381 --> 19:44.714
and that's why we've come here,

19:44.716 --> 19:46.583
'cause here's
where the really big toys are.

19:46.585 --> 19:47.684
We've got a barge.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.519
We've got our pick of tugboats.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.254
We've got full-size crab pot

19:51.256 --> 19:54.724
and it's now time to see if the
killer loop works in full scale.

19:54.726 --> 19:57.493
Well,
hold your steel horses, Adam,

19:57.495 --> 20:00.763
because before that,
the guys get loaded,

20:00.765 --> 20:02.599
first with Buster.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.634
Little does he know.

20:04.636 --> 20:06.736
Then a pair of crab pots.

20:06.738 --> 20:08.705
The primary thing, I think,
when I see those crab pots

20:08.707 --> 20:09.906
is I get hungry.

20:09.908 --> 20:12.609
And finally,
a crab-pot launcher.

20:13.477 --> 20:15.345
Bingo! That worked perfectly.

20:15.347 --> 20:16.512
Yeah.

20:16.514 --> 20:18.948
Next comes the gratuitous
painting montage...

20:18.950 --> 20:20.984
Isn't that nice and cheery now?

20:20.986 --> 20:22.752
<i>That's</i> an experimental space.

20:22.754 --> 20:25.355
...Which leaves just one thing.

20:25.357 --> 20:26.422
Ahoy, mateys.

20:26.424 --> 20:28.625
Permission to come aboard, captain.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.159
A pair of "catch" captains

20:30.161 --> 20:33.596
ready to see if this myth
will make waves.

20:33.598 --> 20:35.131
That's where we're headed, Johnny.

20:35.133 --> 20:36.866
We're going to Alcatraz!

20:36.868 --> 20:38.167
I knew it. I knew this was a trick.

20:38.169 --> 20:39.602
They set us up!

20:39.604 --> 20:43.239
So, we're headed out into the
middle of San Francisco Bay,

20:43.241 --> 20:46.276
and we're gonna find a spot
that has similar depth

20:46.278 --> 20:47.577
to what a crab fisherman

20:47.579 --> 20:50.713
would normally set his pots in
in Alaska.

20:50.715 --> 20:53.483
That depth is around 200 feet.

20:53.485 --> 20:55.485
You don't get a view like this
on my boat.

20:55.487 --> 20:59.088
And when they find it,
it's time to go fishing.

20:59.090 --> 21:00.490
So, we're gonna strap it up,

21:00.492 --> 21:02.125
and we're gonna hook it
to this big crane,

21:02.127 --> 21:04.093
and we're gonna put it in the
launcher and get it ready to set.

21:04.095 --> 21:05.561
There we go.

21:05.563 --> 21:08.131
Like in the Bering Sea,

21:08.133 --> 21:10.233
it's suddenly all hands on deck.

21:10.235 --> 21:11.534
Just get back.

21:11.536 --> 21:14.137
Keep your fingers out of the way.

21:14.139 --> 21:16.406
Well, nearly all hands.

21:20.210 --> 21:23.913
Luckily, Adam's seasickness
sleepiness soon wears off,

21:23.915 --> 21:27.016
so here's how this myth is going down.

21:27.018 --> 21:28.818
This is how this is gonna work.

21:28.820 --> 21:31.220
This table here is called
the crab-pot launcher.

21:31.222 --> 21:33.589
Now, the crane's gonna
hook onto this line

21:33.591 --> 21:35.091
and lift the end of the table,

21:35.093 --> 21:37.493
making the crab pot
slide off into the water...

21:37.495 --> 21:39.729
all 800 pounds of it.

21:39.731 --> 21:42.365
And when that 800 pounds
of crab pot hits the water,

21:42.367 --> 21:44.667
it starts sinking
towards the bottom really fast,

21:44.669 --> 21:46.569
pulling all of this line with it

21:46.571 --> 21:49.038
and maybe, in this arrangement, Buster.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.474
This is where we find out
if this loop of rope

21:51.476 --> 21:53.242
is, in fact, a <i>killer</i> loop of rope.

21:53.244 --> 21:56.713
Indeed, and thanks
to a special depth gauge...

21:56.715 --> 21:58.214
He's ready.

21:58.216 --> 22:01.117
Mapping Buster's sea trek
will be simple.

22:01.119 --> 22:03.753
And Adam, for one, is confident.

22:03.755 --> 22:06.656
It's time for a prediction,
and I have to say,

22:06.658 --> 22:08.591
based on what I've seen
in the small-scale test,

22:08.593 --> 22:12.095
I think it's pretty clear
Buster's going down...

22:12.097 --> 22:16.132
all the way down to Davy Jones' locker,

22:16.134 --> 22:17.600
if it is, indeed, down there.

22:17.602 --> 22:19.802
Okay, we're good to go.

22:19.804 --> 22:21.204
Here we go.

22:21.206 --> 22:24.707
"Deadliest Catch" killer loop
of death, full-size test.

22:24.709 --> 22:28.978
3, 2, 1, go!

22:28.980 --> 22:31.180
With the barge
cruising at five knots,

22:31.182 --> 22:33.082
the crane lifts the launcher.

22:34.385 --> 22:35.918
There he goes.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.654
And, eventually...

22:38.656 --> 22:40.256
Oh, oh, oh.

22:40.258 --> 22:42.125
Uh-oh.

22:42.127 --> 22:44.994
Oh! Uh-oh.

22:44.996 --> 22:47.430
Ow. Ow. Ow.

22:47.432 --> 22:49.665
Not much happens.

22:49.667 --> 22:52.001
Well, that's kind of anticlimactic.

22:52.003 --> 22:54.771
That is a little anticlimactic,
but that looks like it hurts.

22:54.773 --> 22:58.608
The thing about ropes
uncoiling and grabbing your leg

22:58.610 --> 23:00.710
is that it's a chaotic situation

23:00.712 --> 23:02.345
where pretty much anything could happen,

23:02.347 --> 23:04.881
and in this case,
Buster became a human chock.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.083
And stopped the rope
at the edge of the boat.

23:07.085 --> 23:08.484
Now, if that had been me,

23:08.486 --> 23:10.253
I would have been screaming
bloody murder,

23:10.255 --> 23:12.722
but one way or another,
I would have stayed on the boat,

23:12.724 --> 23:14.090
and that's a result.

23:14.092 --> 23:15.892
It is a painful result,

23:15.894 --> 23:17.627
but the guys aren't giving up yet.

23:17.629 --> 23:20.329
Coming to the rescue, Buster.
We got you covered.

23:20.331 --> 23:22.932
With Buster delicately disentangled...

23:24.269 --> 23:26.436
The pot's hauled back up for test two...

23:26.438 --> 23:27.437
Everybody stand back.

23:27.439 --> 23:28.738
Where this time,

23:28.740 --> 23:32.108
our crash-test crabber
is gonna have a bird's-eye view.

23:32.110 --> 23:33.943
This is a pretty typical scenario.

23:33.945 --> 23:36.145
Buster just threw his first shot
overboard.

23:36.147 --> 23:38.080
He reaches around to grab the next shot.

23:38.082 --> 23:39.615
Oops. Stepped on the line.

23:39.617 --> 23:41.017
Killer bite.

23:41.019 --> 23:43.219
He sure is
closer to the action,

23:43.221 --> 23:44.854
but will he be man overboard?

23:46.124 --> 23:49.459
"Deadliest Catch" killer
cable loop, test number two.

23:49.461 --> 23:52.395
3, 2, 1, go ahead. Lift it.

23:52.397 --> 23:54.530
Once again,
the crane lifts the crab pot,

23:54.532 --> 23:57.667
but as it does so,
Buster takes a tumble...

23:57.669 --> 23:59.936
Oh.

23:59.938 --> 24:01.938
And falls out of the loop.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.373
- Oh, that doesn't look good.
- Ouch.

24:04.375 --> 24:06.609
He's got a nasty rope burn.

24:06.611 --> 24:09.479
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

24:09.481 --> 24:11.214
Ah!

24:11.216 --> 24:12.515
And there it goes.

24:12.517 --> 24:15.384
Well, that experiment
didn't go very well for us.

24:15.386 --> 24:17.487
It went better for Buster
than we had planned

24:17.489 --> 24:19.322
because he didn't go over the side.

24:19.324 --> 24:20.656
Got a nasty rope burn.

24:20.658 --> 24:22.792
A couple of buoys might have
given him a concussion.

24:22.794 --> 24:25.495
But the problem was he fell over.

24:25.497 --> 24:27.230
That's not what we wanted to see.

24:27.232 --> 24:28.464
That's not accurate,

24:28.466 --> 24:31.100
so we're gonna reset,
regroup, and try again.

24:31.102 --> 24:32.268
Buster's asked us not to,

24:32.270 --> 24:34.704
but he doesn't have a say in the matter.

24:35.633 --> 24:37.767
Do not try what
you're about to see at home.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.047
We are what you call experts.

24:44.935 --> 24:47.070
In
the "Deadliest Catch" special,

24:47.072 --> 24:49.605
the MythBusters are making waves...

24:49.607 --> 24:52.809
Oh, my gosh!

24:52.811 --> 24:54.544
Because Kari and Tory

24:54.546 --> 24:57.613
have just had
a sleep-deprivation disaster.

24:57.615 --> 24:58.448
Oh!

24:58.450 --> 25:00.883
Score was 34.

25:00.885 --> 25:03.252
So, what's next?

25:03.254 --> 25:04.387
Good news.

25:04.389 --> 25:07.056
We're gonna stay up
for over 30 hours again,

25:07.058 --> 25:09.125
but this time, we're gonna take naps

25:09.127 --> 25:10.693
every 6 hours for 20 minutes,

25:10.695 --> 25:13.029
and then we're gonna run
the course again

25:13.031 --> 25:15.331
and see if that doubles our performance.

25:15.333 --> 25:17.700
That's the theory.

25:17.702 --> 25:20.303
Nap number one.

25:20.305 --> 25:23.039
But with their first nap
falling just after lunch...

25:23.041 --> 25:26.075
The mattresses aren't very comfortable.

25:26.077 --> 25:30.046
Neither Kari nor Tory
is tired enough to sleep at all.

25:30.048 --> 25:32.582
20 minutes is up already?

25:32.584 --> 25:35.818
After another six hours
of killing time...

25:35.820 --> 25:38.020
♪ 99 bottles of beer on the wall ♪

25:38.022 --> 25:39.889
♪ 99 bottles of beer

25:39.891 --> 25:43.092
♪ take one around, pass it around ♪

25:43.094 --> 25:45.428
♪ 98 bottles of beer on the wall ♪

25:45.430 --> 25:47.663
Okay, enough of that.

25:47.665 --> 25:51.467
They hit the hay once more
but experience the same problem.

25:51.469 --> 25:54.003
7:00 P.M. I'm not remotely tired,

25:54.005 --> 25:58.241
but I know it's time to take
a nap, but it is for science.

25:58.243 --> 26:00.143
In fact, it's not until

26:00.145 --> 26:02.612
they've kept each other awake
for 18 hours...

26:04.048 --> 26:05.648
I don't like this game anymore.

26:05.650 --> 26:10.353
That the guys finally do
drop off, albeit not for long.

26:12.557 --> 26:13.923
Stop! Stop!

26:19.129 --> 26:20.396
Was that 20 minutes?

26:20.398 --> 26:22.331
And so the pattern repeats

26:22.333 --> 26:25.168
as the guys do anything to stay awake...

26:25.170 --> 26:27.203
Mayday! Mayday!

26:27.205 --> 26:28.738
Ship's going down!

26:28.740 --> 26:31.674
Before crashing in their cabins.

26:35.246 --> 26:37.146
Has it been 20 minutes already?

26:37.148 --> 26:41.617
Luckily, it's not long
before dawn arrives,

26:41.619 --> 26:43.519
along with reinforcements...

26:43.521 --> 26:45.521
Let the games begin.

26:45.523 --> 26:48.524
Who are adamant that
this power-nap practice works.

26:49.994 --> 26:52.228
All right, you've been
in conditions where you haven't

26:52.230 --> 26:54.297
had a whole lot of sleep
and you had to keep working.

26:54.299 --> 26:55.698
What do you think about this myth?

26:55.700 --> 26:58.568
It helps me a lot to get
a 20-minute, 30-minute nap

26:58.570 --> 27:00.403
every 4 or 5 or 6 hours,

27:00.405 --> 27:01.805
so I think it's gonna be confirmed.

27:01.806 --> 27:04.974
Is there such a thing as getting
too much sleep in one interval?

27:04.976 --> 27:06.342
Absolutely.

27:06.344 --> 27:08.177
You've got to find that happy medium

27:08.179 --> 27:10.112
where you get enough sleep
but not too much.

27:10.114 --> 27:13.883
And that happy medium
is apparently 20 minutes,

27:13.885 --> 27:16.786
which have just elapsed
for the last time.

27:16.788 --> 27:19.455
<i>Wakey-wakey!</i>

27:22.193 --> 27:24.427
I'm dreaming I'm on "Deadliest Catch,"

27:24.429 --> 27:25.761
but I can't wake up.

27:25.763 --> 27:28.531
I've been up for over 30 hours now

27:28.533 --> 27:31.234
and have taken about five crab naps.

27:31.236 --> 27:33.803
I think the difference is before,

27:33.805 --> 27:35.605
at this point, with no sleep,

27:35.607 --> 27:38.307
I felt delirious,
almost happy and jovial,

27:38.309 --> 27:39.909
because I was losing my mind.

27:39.911 --> 27:43.179
At this point, I'm really cranky.

27:43.181 --> 27:47.316
I might have
maybe a little more alertness,

27:47.318 --> 27:49.185
but I'm so angry.

27:49.187 --> 27:51.654
Well, in that case,
let's get on with the testing.

27:51.656 --> 27:54.790
All right, this is it
for the sleep-deprivation myth.

27:54.792 --> 27:56.726
The moment of truth.

27:56.728 --> 27:59.061
Now, for this myth to be confirmed,

27:59.063 --> 28:01.464
Kari and Tory
have to double their scores

28:01.466 --> 28:02.832
over no sleep at all,

28:02.834 --> 28:05.201
which means Kari has to get a 54,

28:05.203 --> 28:07.970
and Tory has to get a 68.

28:07.972 --> 28:10.306
Seeing their condition this morning,

28:10.308 --> 28:12.441
I think it's gonna be pretty tough.

28:12.443 --> 28:14.510
All right, Kari. You're up first.

28:14.512 --> 28:15.544
You ready to go?

28:15.546 --> 28:17.146
Yes. I need another nap.

28:17.148 --> 28:20.249
Here we go. 3, 2, 1, go.

28:20.251 --> 28:22.919
First up
is hook 'em and cook 'em...

28:22.921 --> 28:24.320
Miss.

28:24.322 --> 28:26.889
Where, for Kari,
it's a case of third-time lucky.

28:26.891 --> 28:28.190
She got it!

28:28.192 --> 28:29.558
The throw and the retrieval
was textbook.

28:29.560 --> 28:30.526
Nice job.

28:30.528 --> 28:33.262
She remains sorted in size matters.

28:33.264 --> 28:34.830
She's doing good.

28:36.267 --> 28:37.800
But this time,

28:37.802 --> 28:40.369
she also scores well with king of swing,

28:40.371 --> 28:42.405
meaning physically, she's doing better.

28:42.407 --> 28:45.141
- Oh!
- That sounded realistic, though.

28:46.311 --> 28:47.677
I like this test.

28:47.679 --> 28:50.646
But how about mentally?

28:50.648 --> 28:52.448
All right.

28:52.450 --> 28:54.583
Find the Farallon Islands.

28:54.585 --> 28:56.953
What is the latitude and the longitude?

28:56.955 --> 29:03.092
So, that's 37°42'N,

29:03.094 --> 29:03.638
123°2'W.

29:07.732 --> 29:08.931
Correct.

29:08.933 --> 29:10.734
This time,
Kari's not just accurate.

29:10.735 --> 29:13.235
Correct. She's also fast.

29:13.237 --> 29:15.871
You'd have to go southeast.

29:15.873 --> 29:17.206
Correct again.

29:17.208 --> 29:20.609
- Go, go, go!
- Oh!

29:20.611 --> 29:22.778
That just leaves shock wave,

29:22.780 --> 29:24.780
where again, Kari does improve.

29:24.782 --> 29:27.083
Okay, go!

29:27.085 --> 29:28.884
And with the time way faster

29:28.886 --> 29:30.619
than the penalty point benchmark...

29:30.621 --> 29:32.088
And time.

29:32.090 --> 29:33.122
Nice job.

29:33.124 --> 29:34.924
It's fair to say she nailed it.

29:34.926 --> 29:36.292
How do you feel?

29:36.294 --> 29:37.593
Like really angry,

29:37.595 --> 29:40.196
and every time I make a mistake,
I want to swear a lot,

29:40.198 --> 29:41.931
and I get you right now. I feel that.

29:41.933 --> 29:43.299
@#$%.

29:43.301 --> 29:46.569
Incredibly, Kari
improved in every single metric,

29:46.571 --> 29:48.604
and with no time penalty to boot,

29:48.606 --> 29:52.141
her score was more than double
that of the no-sleep test,

29:52.143 --> 29:55.244
which is great news for the myth.

29:55.246 --> 29:59.548
With the course reset,
can Tory follow suit?

29:59.550 --> 30:01.083
All right, you ready to go?

30:01.085 --> 30:02.618
I'm ready. All right, here we go.

30:02.620 --> 30:05.988
3, 2, 1, go!

30:05.990 --> 30:08.557
Remember, with no sleep...

30:08.559 --> 30:10.659
Nice! Yeah! Good job!

30:10.661 --> 30:11.861
Good job! Excellent!

30:11.863 --> 30:14.563
Tory did pretty well at all tasks.

30:14.565 --> 30:16.432
Almost.

30:16.434 --> 30:19.635
But what let him down
was his pedestrian pace...

30:19.637 --> 30:21.704
1, 2, 3.

30:21.706 --> 30:23.239
He broke the pot!

30:23.241 --> 30:26.008
Something that's not
afflicting him this time around.

30:26.010 --> 30:28.978
From Cal Maritime to Point Reyes,

30:28.980 --> 30:31.047
what two directions do you have to go?

30:31.049 --> 30:33.949
And although he still struggles
with navigation...

30:33.951 --> 30:36.552
From Cal to here?

30:36.554 --> 30:37.686
To Point Reyes?

30:37.688 --> 30:40.990
Uh, no @#$%.

30:40.992 --> 30:42.758
He's far from flunking.

30:42.760 --> 30:47.963
Southwest to northwest.

30:47.965 --> 30:48.798
Correct.

30:48.800 --> 30:52.468
In the final skill challenge,

30:52.470 --> 30:55.271
Tory equals his no-sleep score.

30:55.273 --> 30:57.139
Yes!

30:57.141 --> 30:59.842
And when he eclipses
his last time trial,

30:59.844 --> 31:01.343
this myth is making waves.

31:01.345 --> 31:03.379
Whoa, you're fast! 4:17!

31:03.381 --> 31:05.381
We got a 4:17.

31:05.383 --> 31:06.882
How did we do?

31:06.884 --> 31:12.221
So, the numbers are in,
and Kari, you needed a 54.

31:12.223 --> 31:13.856
You got a 64.

31:13.858 --> 31:15.357
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

31:15.359 --> 31:16.392
Good job.

31:16.394 --> 31:18.027
Then there's Tory.

31:18.029 --> 31:19.962
You needed a 68.

31:19.964 --> 31:20.996
You got 81.

31:20.998 --> 31:22.498
Yeah!

31:22.500 --> 31:24.133
So, you know what that means?

31:24.135 --> 31:25.801
The myth is confirmed.

31:25.803 --> 31:28.170
A little sleep
is better than no sleep at all.

31:28.172 --> 31:29.004
Confirmed.

31:29.006 --> 31:30.339
Turns out naps help.

31:30.341 --> 31:33.275
Now, it's not so much
that you actually fall asleep,

31:33.277 --> 31:36.846
but what it did do is it allowed
my body and my mind to rest,

31:36.848 --> 31:37.913
which helped.

31:37.915 --> 31:39.682
I mean, it kind of reset everything.

31:39.684 --> 31:42.418
I was much quicker, I was more agile,

31:42.420 --> 31:44.553
and it was easier to figure out
problems,

31:44.555 --> 31:47.623
and the results are
it doubled our performance.

31:47.625 --> 31:49.158
This myth is confirmed.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.794
Best part is this experiment's over.

31:55.633 --> 31:58.167
No more sleep-deprivation myths.

32:06.209 --> 32:09.445
So far,
the killer loop's looking dire,

32:09.447 --> 32:11.147
but not deep.

32:11.149 --> 32:13.282
Ow. Ow. Ow.

32:13.284 --> 32:14.950
Yet all is not lost.

32:14.952 --> 32:17.052
Well, we're set up
and ready to go again.

32:17.054 --> 32:18.287
Hopefully, third time lucky.

32:18.289 --> 32:19.421
Third time's a charm.

32:19.423 --> 32:20.856
We'll test those myths
for no extra cost.

32:20.858 --> 32:23.626
We're about to go with the same
parameters as last time.

32:23.628 --> 32:24.894
You ready?

32:24.896 --> 32:26.328
I'm ready. All right.

32:26.330 --> 32:28.330
"Deadliest Catch" killer loop of death.

32:28.332 --> 32:30.266
The crab-pot experiment.

32:30.268 --> 32:31.734
Let's roll it out!

32:31.736 --> 32:33.068
Go!

32:33.070 --> 32:35.638
The crane
lifts the pot and Adam's hopes.

32:35.640 --> 32:36.839
Here it goes.

32:36.841 --> 32:38.507
Buster's going down.

32:38.509 --> 32:39.608
Oh!

32:39.610 --> 32:41.210
But will it be third time's the charm?

32:41.212 --> 32:42.244
Here we go.

32:42.246 --> 32:43.145
Oh!

32:43.147 --> 32:46.382
- Oh!
- Whoa! Whoa! Look at this!

32:46.384 --> 32:49.385
Taking his leg off! No, no! Wait! Aah!

32:49.387 --> 32:50.853
<i>I'll stop.</i>

32:50.855 --> 32:53.522
Despite causing
severe leg trauma,

32:53.524 --> 32:56.725
Buster is once again staying on deck.

32:56.727 --> 32:58.694
Son of a @#$% is @#$% tough.

32:58.696 --> 32:59.662
No @#$%.

32:59.664 --> 33:01.497
Buster may look stupid,

33:01.499 --> 33:03.899
but he's actually
quite the cunning devil.

33:03.901 --> 33:06.202
He keeps grabbing ahold of
the boat one way or another,

33:06.204 --> 33:08.704
and we can't get him
to get in the water.

33:08.706 --> 33:10.072
What are you gonna do?

33:10.074 --> 33:12.174
The good news
is that on every test,

33:12.176 --> 33:14.677
Buster is being caught by the coil.

33:14.679 --> 33:17.780
The bad news is
that he's never gone overboard,

33:17.782 --> 33:19.582
at least not yet.

33:19.584 --> 33:21.317
Buster is pretty tough.

33:21.319 --> 33:24.620
We've already seen him
endure abuse from these ropes

33:24.622 --> 33:27.723
that would tear a normal human's
limbs clean off,

33:27.725 --> 33:29.858
and yet he still hasn't gone
up and over the side.

33:29.860 --> 33:31.493
We still believe this is feasible,

33:31.495 --> 33:32.861
based on our small-scale tests,

33:32.863 --> 33:34.763
so we've set him
in a different position,

33:34.765 --> 33:37.132
looking over the railing
as the crab pot goes in.

33:37.134 --> 33:38.434
Here we go.

33:38.436 --> 33:40.402
"Deadliest Catch" killer loop of death.

33:40.404 --> 33:43.172
Crab pot goes in the water
and hopefully Buster, too.

33:43.174 --> 33:45.107
3, 2, 1, go!

33:45.109 --> 33:46.208
Come on, Buster.

33:46.210 --> 33:47.643
Come on!

33:47.645 --> 33:49.511
Despite the encouragement...

33:49.513 --> 33:50.379
You can do it.

33:50.381 --> 33:52.681
- There's a hitch.
- Uh-oh.

33:52.683 --> 33:56.285
And it's not the clove hitch
they're looking for.

33:56.287 --> 33:57.753
We're @#$% 100%.

33:57.755 --> 34:01.757
We're totally, totally, 100% @#$%.

34:01.759 --> 34:03.158
How'd that happen?

34:03.160 --> 34:05.094
One thing we have shown is
that it doesn't take much

34:05.096 --> 34:06.996
for that rope to get a good bite
on somebody's leg.

34:06.998 --> 34:09.231
Apparently, going overboard, though,

34:09.233 --> 34:11.033
is a little bit more difficult,

34:11.034 --> 34:12.735
so we're gonna give it another go.

34:12.737 --> 34:14.536
With the sun setting,

34:14.538 --> 34:16.739
there's time for one final fling.

34:16.741 --> 34:18.674
All right. Here we go.

34:18.676 --> 34:21.877
Killer loop of death
up and over the side.

34:21.879 --> 34:26.815
Buster going to Davy Jones'
locker in 3, 2, 1, go!

34:26.817 --> 34:29.083
The pot's set to plunge.

34:29.085 --> 34:31.786
Will Buster finally follow suit?

34:31.789 --> 34:33.489
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

34:33.491 --> 34:34.556
Oh!

34:34.558 --> 34:36.692
Whoa!

34:36.694 --> 34:38.627
At last, he's up and over...

34:38.629 --> 34:40.295
Okay, time for the buoys.

34:40.297 --> 34:43.699
Closely followed by the rest
of the crab-pot paraphernalia.

34:43.701 --> 34:46.168
- Buster went over!
- Yeah!

34:46.170 --> 34:47.703
Yeah!

34:47.705 --> 34:50.839
You guys are exalting at what
would be the worst day...

34:50.841 --> 34:52.141
the worst day of our lives.

34:52.143 --> 34:54.643
But despite the celebration,

34:54.645 --> 34:57.346
getting grabbed is only half the story.

34:57.348 --> 35:02.451
What's more important is seeing
if Buster went all the way down.

35:06.022 --> 35:08.857
And to find out just that,
once they're alongside,

35:08.859 --> 35:11.427
the team must haul him back
from the brink.

35:11.429 --> 35:13.762
There he is.

35:14.932 --> 35:17.099
You know, with him attached
to the rope there,

35:17.101 --> 35:18.467
I don't need to see his depth gauge.

35:18.469 --> 35:19.835
I know that he went all the way down.

35:19.837 --> 35:21.937
No, the cage is just under the water.

35:21.939 --> 35:24.340
We know that rope bit onto him,
and it never let go.

35:24.342 --> 35:27.109
- It's a nasty way to go.
- Ow.

35:27.111 --> 35:28.410
Here's how this went down.

35:28.412 --> 35:31.447
Buster, standing at the ledge
of the fishing boat

35:31.449 --> 35:33.849
with his foot accidentally
in a loop of rope.

35:33.851 --> 35:36.051
The ab pot going into the drink

35:36.053 --> 35:37.553
and taking its line with it.

35:37.555 --> 35:40.956
Its line accidentally wrapping
around Buster's left leg,

35:40.958 --> 35:43.525
where he pinned against the railing

35:43.527 --> 35:44.927
for just a second until...

35:44.929 --> 35:46.595
Fwwwpt!

35:46.597 --> 35:48.630
He was sucked through

35:48.632 --> 35:51.200
what must have been
the tiniest of openings

35:51.202 --> 35:54.236
at an incredible speed
all the way to the bottom.

35:54.238 --> 35:57.106
In fact, Buster went
100 feet under the water,

35:57.108 --> 35:58.974
and when we pulled the crab cage out,

35:58.976 --> 36:01.009
he was still attached to the line.

36:01.011 --> 36:02.745
Doesn't get much neater than that.

36:02.747 --> 36:05.180
Indeed,
with the knot holding fast,

36:05.182 --> 36:08.717
the 800-pound crab pot
sunk like a stone,

36:08.719 --> 36:10.652
taking Buster to the seabed.

36:10.654 --> 36:14.223
So, while the killer loop may
not always haul you overboard,

36:14.225 --> 36:17.993
if it does, you're going
all the way to rock bottom.

36:18.261 --> 36:20.295
Well, gentlemen, I can't tell you enough

36:20.297 --> 36:22.564
how much we appreciated
your presence here today.

36:22.566 --> 36:24.099
You are honorary MythBusters.

36:24.101 --> 36:26.702
It was a nasty job.
But it was well done.

36:26.704 --> 36:29.505
Watch where you put your feet
on your boats, all right?

36:29.507 --> 36:30.506
Let's get out of here.

36:39.510 --> 36:41.043
Out west in the Bering Sea...

36:41.045 --> 36:42.445
Watch out, Porter. Watch out!

36:42.447 --> 36:44.113
<i>Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!</i>

36:44.115 --> 36:46.516
Mother nature can be a wicked witch.

36:46.518 --> 36:49.218
We only have to go through
the gear 11/2 more times.

36:49.220 --> 36:51.788
In San Francisco, not so much.

36:51.790 --> 36:54.457
But on the plus side...

36:54.459 --> 36:57.226
We pause briefly from our
regularly scheduled program

36:57.228 --> 36:58.561
to bring you,

36:58.563 --> 37:00.062
for the first time ever
on a "MythBusters" program,

37:00.064 --> 37:02.064
double rainbow all the way down.

37:02.066 --> 37:03.132
Myth confirmed.

37:09.687 --> 37:11.621
In the "Deadliest
Catch" special...

37:12.623 --> 37:15.191
it's time for the one that nearly got away.

37:19.564 --> 37:22.632
All right, so, it looks like
this myth is confirmed.

37:22.634 --> 37:24.233
You can double your performance

37:24.235 --> 37:26.369
if you take 20-minute power naps
every 6 hours.

37:26.371 --> 37:27.370
Confirmed.

37:27.372 --> 37:28.371
All right, so, is that it?

37:28.373 --> 37:29.373
Are you headed back North?

37:29.374 --> 37:30.540
No.

37:30.542 --> 37:31.841
Remember a little Twitter banter

37:31.843 --> 37:34.377
we had going on a couple months ago?

37:34.379 --> 37:35.545
About blowing up a crab pot?

37:35.547 --> 37:36.713
That's right.

37:36.715 --> 37:38.581
We told them that if they
brought a crab pot down,

37:38.583 --> 37:39.782
we would blow it up for them,

37:39.784 --> 37:41.351
'cause they didn't think we could do it.

37:41.353 --> 37:42.685
We just happen to have a crab pot

37:42.687 --> 37:44.454
out in the back of a truck
in the parking lot.

37:44.456 --> 37:45.455
We come prepared.

37:45.457 --> 37:46.622
So, you want to test the myth

37:46.624 --> 37:48.624
that a crab pot is indestructible?

37:48.626 --> 37:49.792
Absolutely.

37:49.794 --> 37:51.427
Well, we could
sit here and talk about it,

37:51.429 --> 37:53.029
or we could go
out to the bomb range and do it.

37:53.031 --> 37:55.965
Let's go out to the bomb range
and do it.

37:55.967 --> 37:59.369
So, once upon a time
in the west,

37:59.371 --> 38:01.904
it's the MythBusters...

38:01.906 --> 38:04.474
Versus the captains...

38:05.542 --> 38:11.948
in the Twitter tall tale
of the explosive-proof crab pot.

38:13.385 --> 38:15.551
Ew. That's disgusting.

38:17.655 --> 38:20.156
So, this is
one of the actual crab pots

38:20.158 --> 38:23.092
from Johnathan's boat,
and this thing is a brute.

38:23.094 --> 38:26.529
It measures 7 by 7 by 3 feet tall

38:26.531 --> 38:28.097
and weighs 800 pounds.

38:28.099 --> 38:30.433
I got to say, seeing this thing
up close and personal,

38:30.435 --> 38:32.468
it's damn tough.

38:32.470 --> 38:34.771
Damn tough, it is.

38:35.099 --> 38:39.936
But will a three-pound payload
of C4 spell disaster?

38:39.938 --> 38:42.939
I like to call this the crab's revenge.

38:42.941 --> 38:44.440
Well, Johnathan thinks not.

38:44.442 --> 38:46.275
I don't know
if this is scientific or not,

38:46.277 --> 38:48.377
but there's two reasons why
I'm gonna win this bet.

38:48.379 --> 38:52.014
Number one, we beat the heck
out of these pots all year long,

38:52.016 --> 38:53.549
and we never lost one yet.

38:53.551 --> 38:55.017
Number two, it's 90% air.

38:55.019 --> 38:57.687
There's nothing
that will restrict the blast.

38:57.689 --> 39:00.056
Basically, they're gonna be
buying me crab dinner tonight.

39:00.058 --> 39:02.158
With fire in the hole...

39:02.160 --> 39:03.993
All right. That looks good.

39:03.995 --> 39:07.330
And dinner on the line,
as well as pride,

39:07.332 --> 39:10.433
best to clarify the rules.

39:10.435 --> 39:11.634
Now, before we get down to business,

39:11.636 --> 39:13.469
there's just one more thing
we need to clarify,

39:13.471 --> 39:17.607
and that is our definition
of "indestructible."

39:17.609 --> 39:19.108
Look, we know the webbing's gonna be

39:19.110 --> 39:22.211
blown out of the pot,
but the steel will stay intact.

39:22.213 --> 39:24.380
There will be no damage done
to the steel.

39:24.382 --> 39:25.848
Okay, I'll give you the web,

39:25.850 --> 39:29.452
but if one weld breaks,
if one arm is severed,

39:29.454 --> 39:32.488
myth busted, and you are buying dinner.

39:32.490 --> 39:34.423
Oh, you're dreaming.

39:34.425 --> 39:36.359
The fighting
talk's ready to rumble,

39:36.361 --> 39:39.028
so let's make room for the boom.

39:39.030 --> 39:40.630
Fire in the hole!

39:40.632 --> 39:43.432
I always wanted to do that.

39:45.336 --> 39:46.602
Oh, yeah.

39:46.604 --> 39:50.306
This is three pounds of c4
on an indestructible crab pot.

39:50.308 --> 39:51.407
In three, two...

39:51.409 --> 39:52.475
Anybody seen my hat?

39:52.477 --> 39:54.544
- Right there...
- One!

39:54.546 --> 39:57.113
Whoa!

39:57.115 --> 39:59.582
That was awesome!

39:59.584 --> 40:01.117
I think we still got a crab pot.

40:01.119 --> 40:02.451
You're gonna be
buying some dinner tonight.

40:02.453 --> 40:04.887
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's go take a closer look.

40:04.889 --> 40:05.955
We don't know.

40:05.957 --> 40:06.956
There could be a weld broken on that.

40:06.958 --> 40:08.224
Yeah, but your hat's gone.

40:11.461 --> 40:14.864
It's hats off to
the crab pot as it survives

40:14.866 --> 40:17.567
the three-pound percussion
completely intact...

40:17.569 --> 40:20.603
no broken steel, no sheared welds,

40:20.605 --> 40:23.139
and even the webbing's still
mostly in place.

40:23.141 --> 40:26.542
But Tory's not throwing in
the towel just yet.

40:26.544 --> 40:27.810
I'm a little disappointed.

40:27.812 --> 40:30.513
I'll be honest. I'm a <i>lot</i> disappointed.

40:30.515 --> 40:34.050
Three pounds of C4 did not make
the crab pot disappear.

40:34.052 --> 40:35.685
Now, we did make his hat disappear,

40:35.687 --> 40:37.787
but, anyway,
it's all about the crab pot.

40:37.789 --> 40:39.322
Whatever!

40:39.324 --> 40:40.623
We're gonna retry this

40:40.625 --> 40:43.192
because we may have
leveled the playing field

40:43.194 --> 40:44.527
just a little too much.

40:44.529 --> 40:47.163
This time, we're gonna
strategically place the C4

40:47.165 --> 40:49.498
and see if we can do some damage
to that crab pot.

40:49.500 --> 40:52.234
I ain't buying those guys dinner.

40:52.236 --> 40:53.769
So, for test two...

40:53.771 --> 40:54.971
Perfect.

40:54.973 --> 40:57.306
Tory's splitting the payload into three.

40:57.308 --> 41:01.077
And this time, he's secured it
straight on the struts.

41:03.548 --> 41:04.880
Okay, it's your turn.

41:04.882 --> 41:05.915
Okay, test number two,

41:05.917 --> 41:06.916
and I don't know why we're doing this.

41:06.918 --> 41:07.917
We already won the bet.

41:08.953 --> 41:10.219
Three, two, one.

41:11.922 --> 41:13.456
Oh!

41:13.458 --> 41:15.725
Wait. Wait. Wait.

41:15.727 --> 41:17.994
Holy smokes.

41:17.996 --> 41:18.995
This time,
it's not immediately clear

41:18.997 --> 41:21.030
what's happened,

41:21.032 --> 41:24.567
and for once,
the high-speed doesn't help,

41:24.569 --> 41:28.037
so the guys go in for a closer look...

41:28.039 --> 41:29.538
Can't believe it!

41:29.540 --> 41:31.107
That is what I'm talking about!

41:31.109 --> 41:34.076
Where it's good
news for the MythBusters

41:34.078 --> 41:36.345
and bad news for the pot.

41:37.881 --> 41:39.715
This crab pot flipped.

41:39.717 --> 41:41.050
We had the charges underneath.

41:41.052 --> 41:42.985
Look at how much damage was done
to the corners.

41:42.987 --> 41:45.054
I got to tell
you, I am impressed.

41:45.056 --> 41:46.589
I didn't think it could be done.

41:46.591 --> 41:48.691
I can't believe the damage
you did to this crab pot.

41:48.693 --> 41:49.725
Wow!

41:49.727 --> 41:52.728
All right, judge, who's buying dinner?

41:52.730 --> 41:54.530
All right, well, by the definition

41:54.532 --> 41:56.265
that we set forth ahead of time,

41:56.267 --> 41:59.335
this crab pot is not indestructible.

41:59.337 --> 42:00.369
Yeah!

42:00.371 --> 42:01.871
You owe them dinner.

42:04.875 --> 42:06.075
Luckily for you, gentlemen,

42:06.077 --> 42:09.011
I know some really expensive,
delicious places.

42:09.013 --> 42:10.513
And I'm hungry.

42:10.515 --> 42:11.914
Oh, boy.

42:11.916 --> 42:13.716
Next week
on "Deadliest Catch"...

42:13.718 --> 42:14.984
Greenhorns from San Francisco.

42:14.986 --> 42:15.985
Yeah.
