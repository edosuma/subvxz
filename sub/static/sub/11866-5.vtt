WEBVTT

00:05.797 --> 00:07.173
(ALARM BLARING)

00:11.553 --> 00:13.134
I need to know.

00:18.810 --> 00:19.845
(SIGHS)

00:31.073 --> 00:32.404
I need to know.

00:42.626 --> 00:45.743
MAN ON RADIO:
A huge round of thanks
to all the volunteers...

00:50.592 --> 00:51.923
Carter.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.417
What you doing?

00:54.388 --> 00:55.377
I'm the sheriff.

00:55.472 --> 00:56.882
I'm sheriffing.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.966
You were supposed meet me
at Global a half an hour ago
for your physical.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.426
Yeah, good news.

01:02.521 --> 01:05.479
I gave myself the physical
and I'm in perfect health.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.806
All right, it's mandatory.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.562
You can't be insured
by Global without one.

01:09.611 --> 01:10.987
Yeah, now's not a good time.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.279
We're really,
really, super busy.

01:20.163 --> 01:23.075
Okay, this is the third time
you've put this off.
What's up?

01:23.125 --> 01:24.661
Do you really wanna know?

01:24.751 --> 01:27.367
No, Ijust enjoy
our morning banter.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.927
Because I don't want to die.

01:37.973 --> 01:40.589
Isn't that
the whole point of taking
the physical, Carter?

01:40.684 --> 01:42.424
No, that's tempting fate.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.885
Insure a cop today,
he takes a bullet tomorrow.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.269
Oh, what are you,
superstitious?

01:46.315 --> 01:48.772
It's not superstition
if it's true, which it is.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.941
Okay, you know what?
You're not grasping
the point here.

01:50.986 --> 01:53.102
If you don't
take the physical,
you don't have a job.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.357
So, strip. We'll just
do the physical here.

01:56.491 --> 01:59.278
Excuse me?
Oh, we all have a past.
This was mine.

01:59.328 --> 02:00.784
So, time's a-wasting.

02:00.871 --> 02:01.860
Drop 'em.

02:01.955 --> 02:06.119
I'm gonna need to
see some credentials
if you are a doctor.

02:06.168 --> 02:08.705
Was a doctor,
before Kevin was born.

02:08.837 --> 02:11.704
But I still think
I remember where
all the main parts are.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.504
So drop your pants.

02:14.176 --> 02:15.131
No.

02:15.218 --> 02:20.133
There'll be no pant dropping
without a nice dinner
and many, many cocktails.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.507
(PHONE RINGING)

02:25.062 --> 02:26.142
Deputy Lupo.

02:26.229 --> 02:28.015
This is Car/son.
Where '3 Cobb?
Dr. Car/son...

02:28.106 --> 02:29.516
Calm down.
Who is it?

02:29.608 --> 02:31.144
I’m trying to...
Just breathe.

02:31.193 --> 02:33.104
...standing here
in the middle of...
Okay, get a paper bag...

02:33.153 --> 02:35.144
What?
Breathe into it.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.482
Who is that?

02:36.531 --> 02:39.022
Carl Carlson.
He 911s all the time.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.106
We can ignore it.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.491
Not on my watch.

02:41.536 --> 02:42.867
Carter.
Sorry, Allison.

02:42.954 --> 02:44.114
Gotta go.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.825
Protect and serve.

02:48.710 --> 02:49.950
Wait for it.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.957
Where am I going, exactly?

02:54.007 --> 02:57.340
Hello? Don ’t put me on hold
or I'll kill you!

03:07.270 --> 03:09.682
Carl Carlson?
You're not Sheriff Cobb.

03:09.731 --> 03:11.016
No.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.931
Sheriff Cobb retired.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.853
I took his place.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.438
There was a town meeting

03:19.533 --> 03:21.364
and everything...

03:23.370 --> 03:24.530
I gave a speech.

03:24.621 --> 03:25.906
I don't get out much.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.988
I'm gathering.
Jack Carter.

03:28.667 --> 03:29.702
Do you have any idea

03:29.751 --> 03:32.242
how many strains of
bacteria are transmitted
by hand-to-hand contact?

03:32.337 --> 03:34.874
No. But I'm guessing
you do.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.538
Oh, yeah, well,
I'm really sorry,

03:36.591 --> 03:37.717
but I don't think
this is gonna work out.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.211
I need Sheriff Cobb.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.807
You're still
not Sheriff Cobb.
Yeah, we established that.

03:51.898 --> 03:55.265
But since I'm here, what is
your emergency exactly?

03:55.360 --> 03:56.645
I have to get to work.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.903
You called 911
to burn a ride?

03:59.990 --> 04:01.150
It's a very big day for me.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.323
Sheriff Cobb always
used to give me a ride
on very big days.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.991
Driving makes me
very nervous.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.114
It's okay, Carl.
I'm here.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.070
Client of yours?
Six years running.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.781
Why didn't you tell me
that there's a new sheriff?

04:10.876 --> 04:12.741
It came about
rather unexpectedly,

04:12.836 --> 04:15.498
and I didn't want
to panic you until we had
time to process it.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.752
Yeah, well, now I'm panicking,
because this is a defining day
in my research

04:18.842 --> 04:20.878
and I have absolutely
no way of getting to work!

04:20.927 --> 04:23.919
I'm sure Sheriff Carter
will be happy to drive you.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.003
Yeah.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.305
You know, he is
a former US. Marshal.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.558
Yeah.
Yeah?

04:32.606 --> 04:33.686
Okay.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.726
Only if he puts
the lights on.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.060
Well, that was
surprisingly easy.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.398
He must like you.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.405
Beverly, I don't run
a taxi service.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.786
He's on the verge
of a major breakthrough.

04:46.870 --> 04:47.985
More like a major breakdown.

04:48.079 --> 04:51.162
He's pioneering the field
of cellular regeneration.

04:51.249 --> 04:54.082
You would be helping him
help everyone else
if you do this.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.001
What are we waiting for?
You're making me late.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.883
| used to have a real job.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.305
You're doing a good thing.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.216
Carl!

05:12.521 --> 05:15.308
And remember,
lights but no siren.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.142
Right.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.155
Okay. I got you here
in one piece.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.154
Well, next time,
if you wouldn't mind
cleaning out your car...

05:28.245 --> 05:29.985
There won't be
a next time.
Best of luck.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.324
What do you mean?
You're not coming to my lab?
No, I've got...

05:32.415 --> 05:33.666
Today's the day | go
for all the marbles...

05:33.708 --> 05:37.075
I've got a thing and then
I have another thing.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.501
Oh, 'cause Sheriff Cobb
always used to.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.538
Okay, for the last time, Carl,
I'm not Sheriff Cobb.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.293
I'm an officer of the law,
and Ijust can't...

05:42.342 --> 05:44.333
Mr. Stark, can I get
your signature, please?

05:44.678 --> 05:48.170
ALLISON: Carter!
...get enough of the science
in this town.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.680
Oh, good!
Yeah, so what is
this breakthrough?

05:50.767 --> 05:51.722
It's a remarkable...

05:51.810 --> 05:53.846
I am so tired of that man.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.135
What is it with
you and Carter?

05:55.188 --> 05:56.689
Not Carter, Carlson.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.934
The man's
been here for six years,
he hasn't produced anything.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.640
He's literally more trouble
than he's worth.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.604
Is this really necessary?

06:05.699 --> 06:09.191
I can't risk introducing
new strains of bacteria
into the test area.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.040
Could you
step back, please?

06:19.170 --> 06:21.035
I said step back.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.968
I'm attempting to achieve

06:29.264 --> 06:33.473
"adhesion affinity gradient"
in the proximal blastemal
cells in human tissue.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.051
I'm glad
someone's on that.
Yes.

06:36.104 --> 06:39.392
You know,
when a lizard loses its tail,
it grows back.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.473
It's called
cellular regeneration.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.605
I'm trying to do
the same thing with people.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.106
Well, that's cool.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.444
Beverly encourages me
to take risks

06:50.911 --> 06:55.826
and not wimp out
when I'm on the verge
of something new.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.584
Moment of truth.

07:04.633 --> 07:05.793
One drop.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.256
One drop only.

07:18.563 --> 07:19.552
(SIGHS)

07:32.327 --> 07:34.568
Uh-oh.
What do you mean "uh-oh"?

07:38.959 --> 07:39.948
(GROANS)

08:15.161 --> 08:16.901
ALLISON:
If you'd come to my office
for your physical,

08:16.997 --> 08:18.737
you might not have
been hurt physically.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.369
Well, Dr. Blake,
if you hadn't have tried
to give me a physical,

08:21.459 --> 08:24.166
then I wouldn't have had to
have gone through such
extreme measures to avoid it.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.915
You got off
lucky, Carter.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.587
Well, not as lucky as him.
OFFICER: What happened?

08:27.674 --> 08:31.337
I don't know. It could be
the new tungsten alloy rotor
I installed in the centrifuge.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.001
It could be...
You know what?

08:33.054 --> 08:35.010
Dichloride heptoxide
is unstable when heated

08:35.098 --> 08:36.713
and that's what
probably happened.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.673
In fact I'm sure that
that's what happened.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.099
Probably happened.

08:44.315 --> 08:48.354
Allison, I'm gonna need
Form 395 Tack Two-Charlie.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.855
Nathan...
My call.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.441
He's all yours, Carter.

08:53.575 --> 08:54.906
All mine?

08:55.201 --> 08:58.944
What's Form 395
Tack Two-Charlie?

08:59.664 --> 09:01.780
Revocation
of Government Clearances
and Property.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.035
Carl is being fired.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.991
It is yourjob as sheriff
to oversee

09:05.045 --> 09:09.379
the safe and orderly removal
of all ex-employees
from Eureka.

09:09.758 --> 09:10.964
What does that entail?

09:13.219 --> 09:14.675
ALLISON: Technicians
from Global Dynamics

09:14.721 --> 09:17.178
will pack up anything
that belongs to Dr. Car/son

09:17.223 --> 09:19.339
and conﬁscate anything
that doesn’t.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.723
They'll review
his personal documents

09:20.810 --> 09:23.267
and redact
any classiﬁed information.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.640
Dr. Car/son will then be
scanned to make sure

09:25.732 --> 09:28.439
he’s not concealing
any classiﬁed materials.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.391
A Global Dynamics
Human Resource counselor

09:30.445 --> 09:32.686
will provide Dr. Car/son
with a new résumé,

09:32.739 --> 09:36.106
replacing his tenure at Global
with a plausible government
research project,

09:36.201 --> 09:38.442
complete with
applicable references.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.367
Every molecule of my life
has been erased.

09:41.372 --> 09:42.873
That's our goal.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.406
Have a good day.

09:44.459 --> 09:46.324
Don't touch me.

09:48.379 --> 09:49.835
I'm really sorry
about this, Carl.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.629
Yeah, where am I
gonna sleep?

09:51.716 --> 09:53.092
I'm sure Beverly has a place.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.920
Oh, she's not returning
my calls.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.506
Besides, I cannot sleep
in a public bed.

09:59.140 --> 10:02.132
If Sheriff Cobb were here,
he'd let me stay with him.

10:02.811 --> 10:05.427
But he's not here.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.396
Step two...

10:08.691 --> 10:12.604
Carl, I happen to live
in a hermetically-sealed
military bunker...

10:12.695 --> 10:14.856
Perfect! Thank you!

10:14.948 --> 10:16.609
I'll just call Beverly
and let her know
where I'm staying,

10:16.658 --> 10:18.614
if I had a phone,
'cause I don't have one,
'cause they took it!

10:18.660 --> 10:20.400
So I don't have one.
Can I borrow...

10:20.453 --> 10:21.659
Yeah...
Thank you.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.195
Igota...

10:32.757 --> 10:33.792
CARTER: Hey.

10:33.842 --> 10:36.083
So, you moonlighting
at Staples?

10:36.136 --> 10:38.297
Form 395 Tack Two-Charlie.

10:38.346 --> 10:41.338
Carl has to complete these
before he's allowed
to leave Eureka.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.468
Well, so much
for your paperless society.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.634
Well, these will get filed
with the DOD.

10:45.687 --> 10:49.225
They're not quite down
with the "Save the Tree"
mentality as of yet.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.725
Oh, and that's for you.
Ow!

10:50.817 --> 10:52.978
Oh, yeah, it'll hurt
a lot more if
you try to take it off.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.153
What the hell is it?

10:54.195 --> 10:55.776
Wireless body sensor.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.983
In other words,
portable physical.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.406
It's taking
constant measurements
of your vital signs,

11:00.493 --> 11:02.654
organ functions,
and blood chemistry.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.029
I feel so violated.
Oh, I'll be monitoring you.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.831
Allison!
Blood pressure!

11:08.918 --> 11:10.454
Make sure he signs
every page.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.290
(GROANS)

11:13.923 --> 11:15.663
Beverly, it's Carl again.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.885
Please, pick up
if you're there.

11:19.220 --> 11:22.883
I know you told me
that with risk
come great rewards.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.680
Well, I'm having
a little trouble

11:24.767 --> 11:28.635
seeing what those rewards
are at this moment.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.303
Beverly, listen,
I'm being redacted.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.438
I ’m being exiled
out of Eureka.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.765
You need to call me.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.441
Okay, well, actually,
you’ll have to call
Carter's phone,

11:35.528 --> 11:37.564
not me, ’cause
they took my phone.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.817
That was him.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.858
This is
an unfortunate setback.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.534
It's okay.

11:44.579 --> 11:48.538
Carl Carlson may no longer
be a viable candidate
for our objectives.

11:48.583 --> 11:51.245
However, a new target
has been identified.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.373
You asked to see me, sir?

11:54.464 --> 11:55.499
NATHAN: Yes, Fargo.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.084
I need you to lead
the investigation

11:59.093 --> 12:01.049
Wow! Thank you, sir.

I'm honored.

between us until
I tell you othenrvise.

almost killed me.

Oh, we're going to have
a houseguest tonight,
so remember to pick up.

Good going, Dad.
Is it Allison or J0?

What?

12:26.162 --> 12:28.448
Well, see, I have a bet
going with Vincent.

12:28.539 --> 12:31.667
See, if I win, then he's going
to make me breakfast
in bed for a month.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.537
And if he wins,
I wait tables.

on my love life
or lack thereof.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.414
All right, so who's
this lucky person?

12:39.509 --> 12:40.919
It's a researcher
who got canned today.

I'm going to be needing
a place to sleep tonight.

13:02.407 --> 13:03.647
I’m just cleaning.

I'm irritating.

We have preliminary data
on the lab accident.

18:09.005 --> 18:11.417
Looks like there was
a momentary breach
of the EMG

18:11.507 --> 18:14.465
that coincided
with the accident
in Dr. Carlson's lab.

18:14.552 --> 18:18.010
Pulse wave from the ultrafuge
probably caused
a magnetic disturbance.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.257

seen before.

appears to have come

of the hypothetical guy

like a guy who fell 50 feet.

Why would you take my calls?
I was a loser.

21:06.557 --> 21:08.422
But I'm a new man
now, Beverly.

21:09.059 --> 21:11.220
You told me to take risks
and you were right.

21:14.106 --> 21:17.894
You're touching my skin
without gloves!

21:18.277 --> 21:19.517
Without disinfectant.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.648
Fear kept me
from living, Beverly.

21:21.739 --> 21:24.230
Kept me from
trying the things
at I wanted to try

21:24.283 --> 21:26.444
and doing the things
I wanted to do.

21:26.494 --> 21:30.828
But something extraordinary
happened to me today,
and all that's changed.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.658
I wanted to say thank you.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.966
I've always wanted
to do that.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.134

21:46.180 --> 21:47.420

about it.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.855

22:44.071 --> 22:45.527
You're gonna regret it.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.522
You and I both know
I should've done that
a long time ago.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.316

22:51.412 --> 22:53.494
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

22:53.539 --> 22:54.779
What happened?

22:56.208 --> 22:57.539
Carl! No!

23:02.715 --> 23:03.875

23:03.966 --> 23:05.877

this is worth?

cellular regeneration.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.655

are staggering.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.906
Surgeries, amputations,
organ transplants,

23:33.996 --> 23:35.281
all could become
a thing of the past.

23:35.372 --> 23:37.408
It could change
the entire face of medicine.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.114
Think how much relief
this will give everyone.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.245
Well, except for surgeons.

23:41.337 --> 23:42.577
Oh, and hospitals.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.458
And the guys
who make Band-Aids.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.049
HENRY:
An amazing transformation!

23:50.095 --> 23:51.926
A little too amazing.

23:52.723 --> 23:55.009
Carlson's notjust
a researcher anymore.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.135
He's the research.

23:56.226 --> 23:58.217
He's finally come through.
I'd think you'd be happy.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.888
Look, I'll be the first one
to jump up and down if he can
replicate the results.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.772
But until then,
he needs to be studied.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.561
Dr. Stark.

24:05.653 --> 24:08.440
I have some numbers
for you to sign off on.

24:08.489 --> 24:10.400
Thank you.
If you'll excuse me.

24:12.409 --> 24:14.741
I think we found the source
of the exotic particles.

24:14.787 --> 24:18.120
There was an electro-magnetic
breach in the floor
above Section Five.

24:18.749 --> 24:19.784
Which room?

24:19.875 --> 24:22.992
I can't say. The room
doesn't appear on any of
the published schematics.

24:23.087 --> 24:24.452
It's classified, and I'm not,

24:24.505 --> 24:26.962
so, unless you wanna up
my security clearance?

24:27.049 --> 24:28.380
Yeah, give it to me.

24:39.395 --> 24:41.181
Oh, that's not possible.

24:41.772 --> 24:43.137
There's 20 layers of concrete

24:43.190 --> 24:47.399
and charged-particle
barricades surrounding
the room.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.983
What's in there
that's so dangerous?

25:04.086 --> 25:08.045
When I perfect this formula,
I can make you invincible.

25:08.132 --> 25:09.918

When I first looked
at Carl's blood work,

32:26.445 --> 32:29.903
I thought the explosion had
somehow reprogrammed his cells
to spontaneously regenerate.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.154
It didn't?
No.

allowed Carl to access

maybe I'm only accessing
five percent of mine,

38:03.364 --> 38:04.900
Carter, damn it.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.982
He's not breathing.
Call for help!

38:08.077 --> 38:09.112
ALLISON: We're losing him!

38:09.204 --> 38:10.410
I know what to do.

38:11.623 --> 38:12.988
Get him back to Global! Now!

38:16.711 --> 38:18.793
ALLISON: Please let me call in
a trauma surgeon.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.338
It's not working!

38:22.967 --> 38:25.754
I have to get closer to it,
the artifact.

38:26.805 --> 38:29.046
You can't.
It's the only way.

38:29.599 --> 38:31.965
We have to go
to Section Five. Now.

38:32.644 --> 38:33.724
Wait here.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.177
What? No!
I'm coming with you.

38:35.271 --> 38:36.852
You're not authorized.
Nathan, this is ridiculous!

38:36.940 --> 38:38.646
The man is dying!
Allie.

38:39.526 --> 38:41.517
If we're gonna do this,
we have to do it alone.

38:42.195 --> 38:43.480
Trust me.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.323
(ALARM BLARING)

38:57.335 --> 38:58.700
That's close enough.

38:58.795 --> 39:00.126
Set him down.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.156
CARL: Hey, welcome back,
Shenﬁ.

39:40.753 --> 39:41.959
NATHAN: Come on, Carter.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.081
You okay?

39:48.344 --> 39:50.209
There you go, come on.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.467
Get him to the infirmary.

39:54.559 --> 39:55.799
MAN: Yes, sir.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.575
Carlson, wait!

40:18.291 --> 40:19.906
Don't do it, Carl.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.079
It's gonna be all right.

40:25.506 --> 40:27.042
It'll destroy you.

40:28.217 --> 40:29.753
I'm not afraid.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.419
Carl, please.

40:34.223 --> 40:35.474
I have to know.

40:37.602 --> 40:38.591
What is it?

40:38.645 --> 40:40.556
One day you will know.

40:41.898 --> 40:45.061
Question is,
will you be ready?

40:51.699 --> 40:52.779
I am.

41:27.402 --> 41:28.517
ALLISON: You sure
you want to do this?

41:28.611 --> 41:31.023
Absolutely.
We've waited long enough.

41:31.114 --> 41:32.650
Because now I'm having
second thoughts.

41:32.699 --> 41:34.064
This was your idea.
Exactly,

41:34.158 --> 41:37.116
and I don't want you
to blame me for
talking you into it.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.571
Oh, hey,

41:38.663 --> 41:41.780
if there's one thing
I've learned from Carl,
it's to take some risks.

41:42.250 --> 41:43.535
Now, come on.

41:44.836 --> 41:45.996
Let's do it.

41:47.380 --> 41:48.961
Okay.
Okay.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.172
Just sign and date here,

41:55.221 --> 41:57.337
and you will be
100% insured.

41:58.391 --> 42:00.973
Well, without Carl around,
maybe I won't be needing it.

42:03.646 --> 42:05.261
Where'd he get
reassigned anyway?

42:05.857 --> 42:08.394
I don't know.
Nathan had it classified.

42:08.651 --> 42:09.857
Figures.

42:10.403 --> 42:11.813
I'm gonna miss him.

42:11.863 --> 42:13.228
All right, here goes nothing.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.281
What made you
change your mind?

42:17.368 --> 42:20.201
Well, can't let fear
run your life, right?

42:21.581 --> 42:22.866
No, we can't.
