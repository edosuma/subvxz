00:12.166 --> 00:15.458
Jamie Lapidus gave me
a hand-job during
the show last night.

00:15.458 --> 00:16.500
I had to tell you.

00:16.500 --> 00:17.667
JAMIE: I hope this is okay.

00:17.667 --> 00:19.917
I was just on the lot
dropping something off
at Merc's.

00:19.917 --> 00:21.959
(JAMIE MOANING)

00:23.959 --> 00:25.208
So, how did Sean
like the watch?

00:25.208 --> 00:27.834
I didn't wanna
put him on the spot
when I gave it to him.

00:27.834 --> 00:31.000
So I had a PA
put it in his car.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.291
(CLUCKING)

00:33.917 --> 00:35.208
Al the camera guy

00:35.208 --> 00:38.834
saw you making out
with Morning in the
parking lot last week.

00:38.834 --> 00:40.208
Should we talk about
what happened?

00:40.208 --> 00:42.250
I had fun.
Me, too.

00:43.709 --> 00:45.542
That's it?
Pretty much.

00:45.542 --> 00:46.667
See you tomorrow.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.875
(MUSIC PLAYING AS
CELL PHONE RINGTONE)

01:51.291 --> 01:52.667
I should probably
get that.

01:52.667 --> 01:54.750
I totally disagree.

01:55.458 --> 01:56.709
Sorry.

01:57.500 --> 01:58.583
Hello?

01:59.709 --> 02:02.500
No, actually,
I'm in the car.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.125
Why?

02:05.750 --> 02:08.333
Oh, my God. When?

02:09.458 --> 02:10.917
Does Merc know?

02:12.458 --> 02:16.750
Okay. Tell him
I'll meet him at home.
All right. Bye.

02:18.333 --> 02:21.083
That was my assistant.
Merc's father died.

02:21.792 --> 02:23.709
Jesus. That sucks.

02:23.709 --> 02:26.000
Well, he's been
in a coma for
the last month.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.458
So, I guess it's
kind of a blessing.

02:28.458 --> 02:31.291
Still. I'm really sorry.

02:31.291 --> 02:32.458
I should go.

02:32.458 --> 02:35.166
Like, this minute?

02:36.291 --> 02:39.291
Seriously? My husband's
father just died.

02:39.291 --> 02:45.458
No, absolutely.
But, it's not like you can
bring the old guy back.

02:45.959 --> 02:51.709
And isn't this really a time
to celebrate the living?

02:51.709 --> 02:54.375
You're making a really
plaintive face right now,
aren't you?

02:54.375 --> 02:55.583
I am.

02:55.583 --> 02:58.000
And you should see
what this guy's doing.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
It would break
your heart.

03:02.041 --> 03:03.375
(SIGHING)

03:04.125 --> 03:05.834
There you go.

03:05.834 --> 03:07.291
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

03:19.166 --> 03:23.291
SEAN:  What's another
word for "cock"?

03:23.667 --> 03:24.917
BEVERLY: What's wrong
with "cock"?

03:24.917 --> 03:28.291
You can't say
"cock" on TV here.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.250
No? Hmm.
How about "prick"?

03:31.250 --> 03:33.250
No.
Seriously, no "prick"?

03:33.250 --> 03:34.375
No "prick."

03:35.834 --> 03:37.500
How about "dick"?
Nope.

03:38.166 --> 03:40.375
"Knob"?
Mmm, don't think so.

03:41.542 --> 03:44.041
"Meat missile"?
"Meat missile"?

03:44.041 --> 03:46.333
That's what the nuns
called it.

03:47.875 --> 03:48.917
Hey.

03:50.208 --> 03:53.458
What do you
call a cock?
A cock.

03:53.875 --> 03:56.667
Right. Anything else?

03:56.667 --> 03:57.709
Something we can
say on television?

03:58.166 --> 03:59.959
"Noodle."
"Noodle"?

03:59.959 --> 04:01.792
That's what I call
my boyfriend's.

04:01.792 --> 04:03.375
Wow. He sounds
like quite the stud.

04:03.375 --> 04:05.667
He's on
anti-depressants.

04:05.667 --> 04:07.375
Oh. Sorry.

04:08.792 --> 04:09.917
Is that it?

04:09.917 --> 04:11.667
Actually,
you came in here.

04:11.667 --> 04:14.458
Oh. Yeah.
The network called.

04:14.458 --> 04:17.000
They want to move
the table read
to tomorrow.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.625
Tomorrow? Why?

04:19.083 --> 04:20.625
Merc Lapidus's
father died

04:20.625 --> 04:22.750
and they all have
to go to the
funeral today.

04:23.417 --> 04:26.917
Oh. That's sad.
Okay. Just let
the stage know.

04:27.250 --> 04:30.000
Okay. Do you want
to send something?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.291
Like flowers
or something?

04:33.667 --> 04:34.917
Uh... Should we?

04:34.917 --> 04:37.959
I don't know. Maybe.
We could call
Carol and ask.

04:37.959 --> 04:39.875
Could you get us Carol?

04:39.875 --> 04:41.041
Huh?

04:42.250 --> 04:43.375
(ENUNCIATING) Carol.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.375
(ENUNCIATING) Okay.

04:48.792 --> 04:50.417
I didn't know
she had a boyfriend.

04:50.417 --> 04:54.250
You've met him.
The gloomy chap with
the disappointing dong.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.208
"Dong."
Good idea.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.083
WENDY: Carol Rance on two.

04:59.959 --> 05:00.959
BOTH: Hi, Carol!

05:00.959 --> 05:02.750
MAN:  Hold for Carol, please.

05:03.291 --> 05:04.750
(BOTH SIGH)

05:05.458 --> 05:06.542
CAROL:  Hi, guys.

05:06.542 --> 05:08.000
BOTH: Hi, Carol.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.875
Hope we didn't
mess you up too much
moving the table read.

05:10.875 --> 05:14.458
No, that's fine. We're just
sorry about Merc's father.

05:14.458 --> 05:18.709
I know. Don't get old.
And if you do,
don't have a stroke.

05:19.917 --> 05:23.750
We were just wondering,
should we send flowers
or something?

05:23.750 --> 05:27.083
Flowers are always nice.
But you shouldn't feel
obligated.

05:27.750 --> 05:28.792
Really.

05:29.542 --> 05:31.125
Sorry for the chewing.

05:31.458 --> 05:34.083
Phil Rosenthal sent
Merc this ginormous

05:34.083 --> 05:37.333
condolence spread
from Zabars in New York. Oh!

05:37.333 --> 05:40.250
I swear, the bagels
were still warm.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.250
So people are
sending food?

05:42.250 --> 05:46.083
No, not everybody.
A few people sent platters.

05:46.083 --> 05:47.458
A muffin basket's
always nice.

05:47.458 --> 05:50.208
But honestly,
don't feel any pressure.

05:50.208 --> 05:51.583
Oh, my God!

05:51.583 --> 05:55.417
They just brought
in a turkey the
size of a Prius.

05:55.417 --> 05:58.667
I hate it when
people die.
I get so fat.

Trying to decide
what to send Merc.

06:31.375 --> 06:33.667
Smart.
Can I get in on that?
Sure.

06:33.667 --> 06:34.667
What are you thinking?

06:34.667 --> 06:36.917
Carol suggested
a muffin basket.

06:36.917 --> 06:37.875
She's an idiot.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.709
Muffins went out,
like, 10 years ago.

06:40.709 --> 06:42.542
Can I leave?
BEVERLY: Yeah.

06:44.834 --> 06:46.750
Not for the day,
though.

06:46.750 --> 06:47.709
Oh.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.208
So if not
a muffin basket...

06:51.208 --> 06:52.375
We should cater
a whole dinner.

06:52.375 --> 06:54.375
A whole dinner?
For how many?

06:54.375 --> 06:56.375
I dunno.
Fifty? 75?

06:56.375 --> 06:58.208
They'll probably
have a ton of people
back at their house.

06:58.208 --> 06:59.875
Doesn't that
seem excessive?

06:59.875 --> 07:02.500
Look, if our ratings
were great, we could
get away with sending

07:02.500 --> 07:04.333
a bowl of cat piss
and a bag of Doritos.

07:04.333 --> 07:05.583
Mmm!

07:05.583 --> 07:08.542
But with our numbers,
we can't be the
cheap assholes

07:08.542 --> 07:10.500
that sent the shitty
little muffin basket.

07:10.500 --> 07:13.417
So instead we're
catering a dinner
for 75 people?

07:13.417 --> 07:14.959
Whatever happened
to somebody dies,

07:14.959 --> 07:15.917
you dig a hole
and bury them?

07:15.917 --> 07:17.417
(SCOFFS)

07:17.417 --> 07:19.542
It's like dealing
with cave people.

07:23.417 --> 07:27.834
It's just so hard!
I should be with him today.

07:27.834 --> 07:29.083
His father died.

07:29.083 --> 07:30.417
I know.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.875
I should be holding him
and comforting him.

07:32.875 --> 07:35.333
I should be helping him
pick out a casket.

07:35.333 --> 07:38.834
You know I'd be
better at it than she is,

07:38.834 --> 07:41.000
which I realize
isn't saying a lot...

07:41.000 --> 07:44.291
Well, uh,
you'll get to see him
at the funeral, no?

07:44.291 --> 07:46.625
(SIGHING)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know.

07:46.625 --> 07:49.834
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Oh, God, I've got
to go hear a pitch.

07:49.834 --> 07:54.125
Some guy's got a TV movie
about his father's triumph
over autism.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.000
It's supposed
to be inspiring.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.917
I am so not
in the mood! Bye.

08:04.333 --> 08:06.542
Look familiar?
Weirdly, yes.

08:07.083 --> 08:10.583
I gave them some pictures
of our first flat to use
as inspiration.

08:11.417 --> 08:13.125
Oh, my God!

08:13.125 --> 08:16.208
Just imagine a brick wall
out that window and the
unrelenting smell of curry.

08:16.625 --> 08:18.834
That, and my ex-wife
calling and hanging up.

08:18.834 --> 08:20.917
Ah. Good times.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.375
They were.

08:24.667 --> 08:28.208
Hey. Bad news on
the catering thing.
We're too late.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.000
Mark Burnett's doing
tonight from The Grill.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.625
Tomorrow night,
Universal's sending
deli from Nate 'n Al's.

08:33.625 --> 08:35.750
Some asshole from
Warner Bros. took Friday.

08:35.750 --> 08:36.834
We're totally shut out.

08:36.834 --> 08:38.000
So we're back
to muffins?

08:38.000 --> 08:38.875
We were never
on muffins.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.500
Anyway, so I called Jamie
and asked her if she had
any ideas.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.208
Jamie who?
Lapidus.

08:47.542 --> 08:48.625
What?

08:50.333 --> 08:52.083
What?
That look.

08:52.083 --> 08:53.458
What look?
No look.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.250
(SIGHS)

09:10.041 --> 09:11.834
We've been kind of
seeing each other.

09:12.333 --> 09:13.917
Who?
Me and Jamie.

09:13.917 --> 09:16.041
Well, I've been seeing her.
She hasn't been seeing...

09:16.041 --> 09:17.542
Blind jokes? Really?

09:17.542 --> 09:18.667
Hey, she makes 'em.

09:18.667 --> 09:23.959
Oh, my God.
You and Jamie Lapidus?
For how long?

09:23.959 --> 09:26.000
Few weeks.
Started the night
of our premiere.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
She gave me
a hand job during
the screening.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.667
A hand job?
During our show?

09:31.667 --> 09:33.834
Relax. It's not like
she was watching it.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.959
I was sitting
right next to you
on the other side!

09:38.959 --> 09:40.625
Gotta say, her side,
much better.

09:40.625 --> 09:42.875
You really
are horrifying.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.166
And what is it with you
and other people's wives?

09:45.166 --> 09:48.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This one's been all
over me for that.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.208
Well...
(ALARM BLARING)

09:52.458 --> 09:54.750
Anyway.
I spoke to Jamie
and she told me

09:54.750 --> 09:55.792
that there's
a couple charities

09:55.792 --> 09:57.875
they're suggesting
people make donations to.

09:57.875 --> 09:59.917
That's better than
the catering thing.
What charities?

09:59.917 --> 10:02.834
Well, one helps
homeless people
get tattoos removed.

10:02.834 --> 10:05.625
That's the stupidest
cause ever.

10:05.625 --> 10:07.208
I think it's for,
like, gang tattoos.

10:07.208 --> 10:09.208
Stuff that's stopping them
from getting jobs.

10:09.208 --> 10:10.750
(ALARM BLARING)

10:13.417 --> 10:14.667
SEAN: What was
the other thing?

10:14.667 --> 10:16.750
Uh, Canadian geese.
What about them?

10:16.750 --> 10:18.750
I don't know.
Ah!

10:18.750 --> 10:20.250
Look, it doesn't matter
what the charities are for.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.542
These are the ones
they picked.

10:21.542 --> 10:23.083
We just have to say,
"Look! Money!"

10:23.083 --> 10:24.458
(ALARM BLARING)

10:25.834 --> 10:28.125
This is, like,
the worst chase
scene ever.

10:29.125 --> 10:31.291
How big a donation
are we talking?

10:31.291 --> 10:34.125
Like $100?
No. Who are you people?

10:34.125 --> 10:35.750
It's got to be
at least a grand.

10:35.750 --> 10:38.750
What?
A thousand dollars?
For geese?

10:38.750 --> 10:40.792
Will they even
know how much
we're giving?

10:40.792 --> 10:43.208
The geese?
Merc and his family.

10:43.208 --> 10:45.375
I don't know.
But in case
they do know,

10:45.375 --> 10:47.792
we got to give a lot.
(ALARM BLARING)

10:50.834 --> 10:52.875
Okay, I'm just
going to check
the back.

10:52.875 --> 10:53.917
Sure.

10:54.792 --> 10:55.792
Hey, you guys.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.500
Do we all want
to go to this
funeral together?

10:58.500 --> 11:00.375
Uh, we weren't
planning on going.

11:00.375 --> 11:02.041
Oh, no, you have to go.
Everybody's going.

11:02.041 --> 11:04.125
Who's everybody?
From all the shows
on the network.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.333
Oh, shit. Really?

11:05.333 --> 11:07.417
Yeah, I've been getting texts
from friends all morning.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.166
Carol didn't say anything
about us having to go.

11:09.166 --> 11:11.417
Duh! They never say
you have to go.

11:11.417 --> 11:13.208
We should go.
(WHIMPERS)

11:13.208 --> 11:14.625
Oh, come on, it's the
right thing to do.

11:14.625 --> 11:16.583
You didn't
say that when my
Aunt Harriet died.

11:16.583 --> 11:18.625
Your Aunt Harriet
didn't run a network.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.792
Hey. Okay,
that was my agent.

11:21.792 --> 11:23.500
He says I got to go
to this fucking funeral.

11:23.500 --> 11:24.750
Thank you!

11:24.750 --> 11:27.834
He also said a
charitable donation
is too impersonal.

11:27.834 --> 11:29.166
So now what?

11:29.166 --> 11:31.875
Supposedly,
Jerry Bruckheimer donated
a dialysis machine

11:31.875 --> 11:33.458
to Cedars in Merc's
father's name.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.291
Jesus!
I know, but apparently
he's a partner

11:36.291 --> 11:39.375
in some dialysis company.
So he gets 'em at cost.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.834
Wow. David Kelly
and Michelle Pfeiffer

11:41.834 --> 11:43.458
are planting a tree
at the cemetery.

11:43.458 --> 11:44.959
Oh, those fuckers.

11:55.125 --> 11:56.375
Wow.

11:56.375 --> 11:58.500
What do you think?
You look like
you're on the news.

11:59.250 --> 12:00.583
Thank you.

12:00.583 --> 12:02.500
The rental car company
sent this over.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.875
It was under the seat
when you turned the car in.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.333
(SIGHS)

12:23.000 --> 12:25.041
We don't have time
for extensions, do we?
No.

12:25.041 --> 12:26.917
No. Okay.

12:28.792 --> 12:30.917
Oh, my God.
Don't you love
this sofa?

12:30.917 --> 12:33.917
Ooh, very nice.
Shopping for a sofa?

12:33.917 --> 12:35.834
No, I'm just really
into catalogs.

12:35.834 --> 12:36.959
I could read 'em
all day.

12:36.959 --> 12:39.792
So you count this
as reading?
It's got words.

12:42.041 --> 12:43.709
Huh!
What?

12:44.667 --> 12:46.750
Look familiar?
The chair?

12:46.750 --> 12:48.208
Uh-huh.
Don't think so...

12:48.208 --> 12:50.583
Isn't that the one Sean
has in his bedroom?

12:50.583 --> 12:52.083
I totally thought
it was an antique.

12:52.083 --> 12:55.542
I can't help you there.
I've never actually
been in Sean's bedroom.

12:57.000 --> 12:57.792
Oh!

13:14.250 --> 13:15.250
Hey.

13:15.792 --> 13:17.500
Ooh, nice.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.208
Did I give you that?
No, you did not
give me this.

13:20.208 --> 13:22.625
You sure?
'Cause I gave out a
bunch of 'em last year.

13:22.625 --> 13:24.500
It's a vintage
Breitling.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.667
Yeah. Well,
if you want a few
more, let me know.

13:28.125 --> 13:29.125
Will do.

13:29.875 --> 13:32.834
Oh, man.
It's gonna be weird
at this thing today,

13:32.834 --> 13:34.542
being with Jamie
in front of Merc.

13:34.875 --> 13:36.792
I would think
it'd be easier
than the last time,

13:36.792 --> 13:38.166
what with no orgasms.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.458
You've never been
with a blind girl, right?

13:40.458 --> 13:42.792
(CHUCKLES) No.
It's good.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.208
You don't have to
suck in the gut.

13:45.208 --> 13:46.500
There's a bonus.

13:46.500 --> 13:49.709
I went out with
this deaf chick once.
Smokin' hot.

13:50.417 --> 13:53.500
But it was a little
weird when she'd
do the dirty talk.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.291
She was kind of like,
(MOCKING) "Fuck me..."

13:55.291 --> 13:56.834
Stop.
I'm just saying.

13:56.834 --> 13:57.959
She was like,
"Fuck me."
No. No.

13:57.959 --> 14:00.375
"Put your finger
in my ass."
(SHUSHING)

14:02.667 --> 14:04.500
Don't talk. Shush!
"I'm a..."

14:04.834 --> 14:05.959
"If you can..."
I don't care!

14:06.417 --> 14:09.834
Ah, look at you two.
Very nice.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.875
I got to say, we all
clean up pretty good.

14:13.625 --> 14:15.083
We should do
something fun after.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.000
You're assuming
the funeral
won't be fun.

14:19.750 --> 14:21.375
I think I got you
in trouble.

14:21.375 --> 14:23.166
What?
I kind of put
my foot in it.

14:23.166 --> 14:24.291
Hello.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.208
MORNING: My friend Carrie
just got to the cemetery.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.208
She says the place
is already packed.

14:38.208 --> 14:40.208
Well, when we get there,
just make sure Merc sees you.

14:40.208 --> 14:42.875
And by the way,
it wouldn't hurt if you
could cry a little.

14:42.875 --> 14:44.208
Are you serious?

14:44.208 --> 14:47.125
I probably will cry.
Just thinking about
what it'll be like

14:47.125 --> 14:49.875
when my parents die.
Do you ever
think about that?

14:49.875 --> 14:52.125
I think about it
all the time.
How old are they?

14:52.125 --> 14:54.208
My mom's 91
and Dad's 93.

14:55.333 --> 14:57.166
How is that
even possible...
Oh, right.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.750
I never think
about me dying.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.667
Do you guys?
More so lately.

15:06.083 --> 15:10.041
You think if you died
the other Friends would
come to your funeral?

15:13.542 --> 15:15.542
Yeah. I think
they'd come.
Even Jennifer?

15:16.875 --> 15:19.000
Yeah. Even Jennifer.

15:19.625 --> 15:21.458
God, can you
imagine the press?

15:21.458 --> 15:23.917
All of you
together again.
Well, not you...

15:23.917 --> 15:26.250
Right.
'Cause I'd be dead.

15:26.250 --> 15:29.875
Sure. But still.
Still. I'd be dead.

15:32.375 --> 15:34.834
I hope I'm still
famous when I die.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.083
(SCOFFS)

15:36.083 --> 15:39.792
Kind of playing fast
and loose with the
word "famous," no?

15:43.458 --> 15:44.625
MATT: When I first
got out here,

15:44.625 --> 15:45.834
I went to Orson Welles's
funeral.

15:45.834 --> 15:47.709
Really? You knew
Orson Welles?

15:47.709 --> 15:49.250
Nah. My publicist
got me in.

15:49.792 --> 15:51.333
I couldn't believe
I was there.

15:51.625 --> 15:53.959
It was like a real
Hollywood funeral.

15:54.625 --> 15:56.500
Jimmy Stewart.
Bob Hope.

15:57.417 --> 16:00.959
Bette Davis.
The biggest fucking
coffin you ever saw.

16:00.959 --> 16:02.625
That guy was huge.

16:03.667 --> 16:05.250
Anyway, I'm standing
next to this woman,

16:05.250 --> 16:07.375
she's, like,
in her 50s.

16:07.375 --> 16:11.458
Sorta looks familiar.
No one's paying
any attention to her.

16:11.458 --> 16:12.875
Turns out
it's Gloria Heywood.

16:13.250 --> 16:14.458
Who's Gloria
Heywood?

16:14.458 --> 16:15.875
Exactly.

16:16.291 --> 16:19.625
We start talking
and she's had
this amazing life.

16:19.625 --> 16:23.000
Like, a big affair
with Bing Crosby.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.333
She won an Oscar for
Best Supporting Actress
in 1950.

16:27.125 --> 16:29.500
Thirty-five years later,
no one even knows
who the fuck she is.

16:30.125 --> 16:31.458
We went out for
a drink afterward.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.125
Ended up back
at her apartment.

16:33.125 --> 16:36.959
This shitty little
two-room place
off Fountain.

16:37.792 --> 16:41.250
She had this ratty dog
who watched us
screwing all afternoon.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.125
It was my first
celebrity fuck.

16:43.625 --> 16:44.667
Hmm.

16:45.417 --> 16:46.917
I just remember
thinking,

16:46.917 --> 16:49.959
"Well, at least now
someone'll remember you."

16:53.333 --> 16:54.417
A couple of years ago,
I googled her

16:54.417 --> 16:56.291
to see if she
was still alive.

16:56.291 --> 17:00.834
Turns out someone
named Josephine Hull
won the Oscar in 1950.

17:00.834 --> 17:02.333
So who was
Gloria Heywood?

17:02.333 --> 17:04.959
Hell if I know.
Some nutjob who
gave me crabs.

17:05.917 --> 17:07.166
She gave you crabs?
Mmm-hmm.

17:07.166 --> 17:10.542
But I learned
a valuable lesson
that day.

17:12.834 --> 17:14.291
How to get
rid of crabs?

17:14.291 --> 17:17.458
Yup. It's come in handy
more than once.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.792
Hey, can't believe
he's gone.

17:27.792 --> 17:30.166
I know, it's the
end of an era.

17:32.417 --> 17:35.792
What are you doing?
Put those away.
If he sees you...

17:35.792 --> 17:38.709
I know, but I just got
a text from a friend.

17:38.709 --> 17:41.709
Matthew Broderick
fell out of his NBC
deal this morning.

17:41.709 --> 17:43.125
His people are
shopping him around.

17:43.125 --> 17:46.250
I don't care.
There is a time
and place.

17:46.250 --> 17:49.041
Matthew Broderick?
Ferris Bueller?

17:49.041 --> 17:51.542
The Producers?
Inspector Gadget.

17:52.625 --> 17:55.542
First of all, I already
know this. I have a call
in to the agent.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.417
More important,
today is not
about work.

17:58.417 --> 18:02.500
Merc's father died.
We have to be here
for him.

18:02.500 --> 18:06.208
I totally hear you.
Sorry.
Yeah, sorry.

18:09.917 --> 18:11.667
What got up her ass?

18:11.667 --> 18:14.709
Thanks so much
for coming, really,
means a lot.

18:22.875 --> 18:24.834
MORNING: Wow!
Nice turnout.

18:25.667 --> 18:27.792
Okay, there's Merc.
Let's do this.

18:31.208 --> 18:33.417
You're here.
How could we not be?

18:33.417 --> 18:34.542
Matty...

18:35.417 --> 18:38.125
My pop's gone.
I'm sorry, man.

18:38.792 --> 18:40.083
Still can't believe it.

18:40.083 --> 18:41.333
I'll bet he was
really proud of you.

18:41.333 --> 18:45.875
He was. And you know,
we didn't speak for,
like, 12 years.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.959
When was this?
Long time ago.

18:48.959 --> 18:50.417
I caught him
cheating on my mom.

18:50.875 --> 18:52.333
Wow.

18:52.333 --> 18:56.959
So I called the
IRS on him, told them how
he was cooking his books,

18:56.959 --> 18:58.834
and he was indicted.
Geez.

18:58.834 --> 19:00.834
Ah! Every family
has their stuff.

19:01.250 --> 19:02.583
And you.

19:04.583 --> 19:05.709
You met him,
didn't you?

19:05.709 --> 19:07.583
Just once.
He was a sweetie.

19:07.583 --> 19:08.834
Didn't he grab
your ass?

19:08.834 --> 19:10.792
He was so
full of life.

19:10.792 --> 19:13.125
Yeah. Not so much
anymore...

19:14.166 --> 19:15.291
Hey!

19:15.291 --> 19:17.041
You've got one job
and that's to keep her

19:17.041 --> 19:18.291
from falling in
the goddamn hole.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.500
What are you
doing over here?

19:19.500 --> 19:20.583
Sorry.

19:26.458 --> 19:27.458
(SIGHS)

19:28.917 --> 19:32.458
Anyway, I'm so glad
you're all here. It really
means the world to me.

19:33.709 --> 19:36.542
And you two,
all the way
from London.

19:37.333 --> 19:38.333
We're so sorry.

19:38.333 --> 19:41.000
(SIGHS) My father
loved England.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.375
It was his
favorite country.
Really?

19:42.375 --> 19:45.125
He always said
it was like Europe,
but in English.

19:45.125 --> 19:46.625
That's actually
our slogan.

19:46.625 --> 19:47.834
(LAUGHING)

19:47.834 --> 19:49.834
You still make me laugh.

19:49.834 --> 19:51.458
Even on a day like today.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.333
Well...

19:52.875 --> 19:54.417
Excuse me.

19:54.834 --> 19:56.291
Ah! You're here.

19:57.125 --> 19:58.291
See you by the hole.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.542
I'm just going to say
a quick hello to Carol.

20:05.625 --> 20:07.500
So what were you
trying to say
to me before?

20:07.500 --> 20:10.000
I didn't know
Beverly's never been
to your apartment.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.375
And this is
important why?

20:11.375 --> 20:13.291
I started talking to her
about this chair
that's in your bedroom.

20:13.291 --> 20:15.625
Okay... Oh!

20:15.625 --> 20:18.917
I'm really sorry.
I wasn't even thinking.

20:18.917 --> 20:21.041
You don't need
to apologize.
You did nothing wrong.

20:21.041 --> 20:22.959
Well...
No.

20:22.959 --> 20:25.583
You're allowed
to be there. It's not
like I was cheating.

20:25.583 --> 20:27.709
I guess.
Yeah, we're separated.

20:27.709 --> 20:29.000
I can do
whatever I want.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.542
I am perfectly
within my rights!

20:30.792 --> 20:33.542
Then why do you
sound guilty?
Because I am.

20:35.041 --> 20:37.000
I am so sorry.
Thank you.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.375
Hey.
You're here.

20:42.166 --> 20:43.583
You holding up okay?

20:43.583 --> 20:46.875
It's endless.
I've probably hugged
400 people already.

20:47.208 --> 20:49.166
Let's make it 401?

20:49.834 --> 20:51.000
Sounds good to me.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.125
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

20:56.208 --> 20:58.375
I want to kiss
your neck.
Mmm.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.250
You feel so good.

21:01.250 --> 21:02.875
And now
it's too long.

21:04.750 --> 21:06.417
He's in a
better place.

21:07.750 --> 21:08.792
How are you?

21:11.667 --> 21:12.750
Hello, again.

21:12.750 --> 21:14.083
William Shatner's here!

21:14.083 --> 21:15.166
The real
William Shatner?

21:15.166 --> 21:16.875
Yes, the real
William Shatner!

21:16.875 --> 21:18.625
Please tell me you didn't do
your impression for him.

21:18.625 --> 21:21.125
I was very restrained.
But inside I was like,

21:21.125 --> 21:23.125
"You Klingon bastard,
you've killed my son!"

21:23.125 --> 21:25.667
Stop it.
Today is sad enough.

21:26.542 --> 21:28.583
Oh! By the way,
thank you so much
for this.

21:28.583 --> 21:30.417
Oh! You're welcome.
Happy birthday.

21:30.417 --> 21:32.417
I'm sorry I haven't
said anything,
but I just got it today.

21:32.417 --> 21:36.458
Ah! I was wondering
when you didn't say
anything.

21:36.458 --> 21:38.750
I thought maybe I got
the wrong thing, or...

21:38.750 --> 21:41.917
No. God, no. I love it.
Exactly right. It's perfect.

21:43.041 --> 21:44.208
Oh.

21:44.583 --> 21:46.792
What?
What time do you have?

21:46.792 --> 21:50.083
Quarter to. Why?
It seems to be running
20 minutes behind.

21:50.083 --> 21:52.375
Oh. Did I not mention
it's a piece of shit?

21:52.375 --> 21:54.959
Might've helped
if you'd put that
in the card.

21:54.959 --> 21:56.250
I'll get it fixed.

22:02.083 --> 22:03.750
So...

22:03.750 --> 22:04.834
Hmm?

22:04.834 --> 22:07.000
Morning was saying
something about
a conversation

22:07.000 --> 22:08.667
she had with you.
Yup.

22:08.667 --> 22:11.625
Where she mentioned
to you that, uh,

22:12.291 --> 22:14.125
she'd been
in my apartment.

22:16.125 --> 22:17.500
You don't owe me
any explanation.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.917
I really don't.
I just said you don't.

22:19.917 --> 22:21.625
And I believe
she said bedroom.

22:22.083 --> 22:23.667
Right. Bedroom. Yeah.

22:29.542 --> 22:30.750
But since you
brought it up...

22:30.750 --> 22:31.917
Yeah?
This was when?

22:31.917 --> 22:33.208
Actually, it was
on my birthday.

22:33.208 --> 22:36.083
So you weren't alone
on your birthday.
Good. Good.

22:36.083 --> 22:37.125
Mmm.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.291
For what it's worth,
I was only with her
the one time.

22:42.291 --> 22:43.333
Mmm.

22:45.542 --> 22:49.208
So you were actually
with her, with her.

22:49.208 --> 22:51.750
I mean, I assumed but...
I was...

22:51.750 --> 22:53.667
With her.
I was with her.

22:53.667 --> 22:56.500
I was with her.
With her, I was.
I can't stop.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.500
Try.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.041
So, just to clarify...

23:06.041 --> 23:08.125
Yeah. Go.
You're saying this
wasn't something

23:08.125 --> 23:09.291
that was going on
back when...
Right.

23:09.291 --> 23:11.417
Back when I thought there
might be something going on...

23:11.417 --> 23:12.625
No.

23:13.291 --> 23:14.458
'Cause I was
suddenly thinking,

23:14.458 --> 23:17.875
"Hmm, maybe
I wasn't so crazy."

23:17.875 --> 23:19.792
No, you were.
Oh, good.

23:20.250 --> 23:21.792
So I have obviously
no reason to feel guilty.

23:21.792 --> 23:22.792
Absolutely none.

23:23.375 --> 23:24.709
I mean,
after what happened
with you and...

23:24.709 --> 23:27.125
Yes. I totally agree.

23:27.125 --> 23:28.542
And it's not like
we're even together.
No.

23:28.542 --> 23:32.917
We're not together.
We are... Not.

23:59.125 --> 24:00.417
It's silly.

24:02.917 --> 24:04.083
Tell me.

24:13.083 --> 24:14.792
I just always
assumed that

24:16.875 --> 24:19.208
when I died
you'd be there.

24:21.250 --> 24:23.834
Or if you died,
I'd be there.

24:25.542 --> 24:30.291
Now I'm thinking...
Who knows? Maybe not.

24:40.250 --> 24:42.250
I told you
it was silly.

24:58.750 --> 25:01.250
It's okay.
He had a full life.

25:19.750 --> 25:21.625
There is an
old Hebrew proverb,

25:22.834 --> 25:24.625
"Say not in grief
he is no more,

25:26.208 --> 25:28.959
"but live in
thankfulness
that he was."

25:30.458 --> 25:32.417
I know everyone
here today

25:32.417 --> 25:35.458
is thankful
that Leo Lapidus
touched our lives.

25:36.333 --> 25:37.417
For 49 years,

25:37.417 --> 25:39.875
he was a devoted
husband to our Selma.

25:39.875 --> 25:43.625
He was a loving father
to Mindy and to Merc.

25:43.625 --> 25:47.166
And he adored
his grandchildren
Sam, Tess,

25:47.166 --> 25:48.709
Emma, Brett and Rose.

25:48.709 --> 25:53.208
But he'd trade you
all in a heartbeat
for an eight handicap.

25:53.208 --> 25:55.208
(ALL LAUGHING)

25:55.208 --> 25:59.000
It's okay, it's all right
to laugh, Leo wanted
to leave us laughing.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.166
May his memory
endure among us
as a blessing.

didn't come?

26:31.917 --> 26:33.625
I'll tell you later.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.417
What?
Tell me now.

26:36.250 --> 26:37.917
Broderick's available.
