00:21.855 --> 00:23.067
Filming?

00:23.091 --> 00:24.468
Mmhmm?

00:24.492 --> 00:26.536
Good morning.

00:26.560 --> 00:30.074
I don't know if I should
wave with my right hand

00:30.098 --> 00:32.433
or try and wave with this hand.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.369
Kinda hurts.

00:39.440 --> 00:43.120
So maybe I'll just
talk about today

00:43.144 --> 00:45.489
and kind of today's significance

00:45.513 --> 00:49.093
but I'll introduce myself
to my camera first.

00:49.117 --> 00:51.128
Eduardo Garcia, hi.

00:51.152 --> 00:54.464
Today I'm going
into an operation

00:54.488 --> 00:56.466
where I've made a decision

00:56.490 --> 00:59.269
to take off my own limb,

00:59.293 --> 01:02.806
this big ole...

01:02.830 --> 01:07.444
left arm of mine I've
had for 30 years.

01:07.468 --> 01:12.749
And I don't know if it's
always done great things

01:12.773 --> 01:16.577
but it's always done
great things by me.

01:22.916 --> 01:27.297
♪ When I grow up

01:27.321 --> 01:29.566
♪ I want to be a forester

01:29.590 --> 01:34.338
♪ Run through the
moss on high heels

01:34.362 --> 01:38.642
♪ That's what I'll do

01:38.666 --> 01:40.877
♪ Throwing out a boomerang

01:40.901 --> 01:45.806
♪ Waiting for it
to come back to me

01:54.448 --> 01:57.894
♪ That's what I'll have

01:57.918 --> 02:01.165
♪ Staring at a sea shell

02:01.189 --> 02:06.536
♪ Waiting for it

02:06.560 --> 02:09.229
♪ To catch me or hold

02:37.425 --> 02:39.193
I remember coming to

02:41.895 --> 02:44.765
and not being able
to move my body.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.580
But I remember knowing that
I had to move my body.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.616
From that point,

02:52.640 --> 02:56.453
from waking up and rolling
over onto my hands and knees,

02:56.477 --> 02:58.412
there's a gap.

03:13.461 --> 03:16.740
My next memory is the road.

03:16.764 --> 03:19.709
I thought I was
totally in a dream,

03:19.733 --> 03:22.312
somewhere in the mountains.

03:22.336 --> 03:26.483
There's no way I could
be in this sensation

03:26.507 --> 03:28.776
and not be in a dream state.

03:31.011 --> 03:34.258
When I put it together
that I wasn't dreaming

03:34.282 --> 03:36.350
was I could hear birds.

03:39.853 --> 03:43.267
I could hear my boots scuffing

03:43.291 --> 03:46.260
and that was real,
that was then.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.331
And then it clicked.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.446
I was out hunting today.

03:56.470 --> 04:00.016
I came across this metal barrel

04:00.040 --> 04:02.952
that was in the earth.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.355
I looked in it,

04:05.379 --> 04:10.250
there's this decomposing
or decaying carcass.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.631
I want to check it
out, I'm curious,

04:14.655 --> 04:16.923
I take my knife out.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.031
But it hits me like I'm
being electrocuted.

04:26.434 --> 04:29.979
I need to get down, I
need to get to a house,

04:30.003 --> 04:32.440
I need to ask someone
to call 911.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.409
There was no warning,

04:59.433 --> 05:02.370
it was just this dead
bear in a metal can.

05:04.372 --> 05:08.308
How was I supposed to know
it was on live power?

05:24.758 --> 05:27.504
The outdoors was my first love

05:27.528 --> 05:30.940
and then cooking was my second.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.434
It came from my environment.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.771
It was a place of freedom.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.150
Food became this language

05:41.174 --> 05:42.719
that I could speak with anyone

05:42.743 --> 05:45.855
from anywhere in the world.

05:45.879 --> 05:50.760
A passion that was
defining who I was in life

05:50.784 --> 05:54.664
and everything was
just coming together.

05:54.688 --> 05:59.536
Something that you've
worked your whole life for

05:59.560 --> 06:04.441
and having it yanked out
from underneath you.

06:04.465 --> 06:08.368
I don't know how else
to describe that.

06:12.205 --> 06:16.520
My phone just started to buzz.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.021
I'm with your brother,

06:18.045 --> 06:19.447
he's been hurt.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.492
I spoke to the surgeon

06:22.516 --> 06:25.662
and he said that I should
speak to Ed on the phone

06:25.686 --> 06:27.806
because it might be the last
time that I speak to him.

06:27.830 --> 06:30.500
I asked him, "Is he
alive, will he live?"

06:30.524 --> 06:32.669
He said, "I've seen cases"

06:32.693 --> 06:35.572
"where people survive
something like this."

06:35.596 --> 06:40.176
He said, "But he would have
some significant handicaps."

06:40.200 --> 06:42.512
There is a lot of maladies

06:42.536 --> 06:43.980
that come out of
an electrocution

06:44.004 --> 06:46.616
because we just don't
know how it affects

06:46.640 --> 06:49.686
all the other tissues
in the body.

06:49.710 --> 06:53.623
And he just wrote something
like "I love you"

06:53.647 --> 06:56.550
and I don't want
to lose my hand."

07:01.489 --> 07:02.932
When Ed first arrived here,

07:02.956 --> 07:06.670
he had several life-
threatening injuries.

07:06.694 --> 07:07.704
It was his hand

07:07.728 --> 07:09.138
which is the entrance wound

07:09.162 --> 07:12.776
and then it was the chest
wall area, his ribs.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.678
He had two areas on his head

07:14.702 --> 07:16.913
which were exit wounds.

07:16.937 --> 07:20.474
He also had a blow out
on his left thigh.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.157
I remember we landed

07:28.181 --> 07:29.559
and the first thing I said

07:29.583 --> 07:30.994
once I woke up when
we landed was,

07:31.018 --> 07:34.498
"So what time are we
going home tonight?"

07:34.522 --> 07:35.865
You know what I mean,

07:35.889 --> 07:38.726
like I just had no
idea how big this was.

07:40.594 --> 07:43.540
Yeah, the amount of current
that went through you

07:43.564 --> 07:44.574
it's amazing that...

07:44.598 --> 07:45.742
You're alive.

07:45.766 --> 07:48.111
Yeah, so amazing.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.571
Amazing I'm alive.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.518
One sec, we'll clean it off.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.285
So just when I look at it,

07:56.309 --> 07:58.522
it just looks gnarly man,

07:58.546 --> 08:02.058
black and funky and...
There's exposed tissue there

08:02.082 --> 08:04.260
and there's concern that
maybe you cut the ribs,

08:04.284 --> 08:06.863
maybe not very alive either.

08:06.887 --> 08:10.033
Baby, look at me and smile.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.057
Smile.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.747
It made me really sad to
think of Ed waking up

08:23.771 --> 08:26.249
without a hand and these
horrific injuries

08:26.273 --> 08:27.851
in a dark room by himself

08:27.875 --> 08:31.579
with just a bunch of
machines just beeping.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.592
During the day is when
everything's normal

08:36.616 --> 08:38.695
and as soon as the night comes,

08:38.719 --> 08:40.929
it's kind of when
crazy stuff happens,

08:40.953 --> 08:42.331
nightmares or whatever

08:42.355 --> 08:44.067
like obviously Ed had
a lot of nightmares

08:44.091 --> 08:46.970
so I was really glad
just to be there

08:46.994 --> 08:49.338
so when he did stir in
the night or whatever.

08:49.362 --> 08:53.209
So really sleeping
there in this chair

08:53.233 --> 08:55.211
was way worth it

08:55.235 --> 08:57.237
and I wouldn't have left.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.317
Yes, he's right here with me.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.952
He's in a little bit of pain

09:02.976 --> 09:05.722
but nothing crazy, just happy.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.757
That felt so good.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.959
So that's you on the CT scanner.

09:09.983 --> 09:14.130
It seemed like they really
cared about each other.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.700
I didn't actually know
that they weren't dating

09:16.724 --> 09:17.901
when I first met 'em.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.326
I thought they were.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.174
I could've been sleeping there

09:25.198 --> 09:26.943
but is that what he needed?

09:26.967 --> 09:30.880
My mom could've been there
sleeping for a month.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.683
Is that what he needed?

09:33.707 --> 09:36.109
No, I think he needed Jen there.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.090
We have to be supportive
of one another

09:41.114 --> 09:42.959
and if you're used
to being the captain

09:42.983 --> 09:44.293
like I was for example,

09:44.317 --> 09:46.329
you have to let go
of certain things

09:46.353 --> 09:50.624
'cause it's really not about
you that much at that point.

09:57.765 --> 10:01.144
Being alive with a few handicaps

10:01.168 --> 10:04.147
is much better than being dead.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.605
That's for sure,

10:06.439 --> 10:08.141
that's for damn sure.

10:10.944 --> 10:11.944
Yeah.

10:17.851 --> 10:22.799
Eduardo and Eugenio came
in on August 4th, 1981,

10:22.823 --> 10:25.201
seven and a half
weeks premature.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.160
We called them the boys.

10:29.062 --> 10:32.275
Indra was two and
a half years old.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.011
We were living in Calabasas
outside of Los Angeles.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.113
Then, when they were
three months old,

10:37.137 --> 10:38.371
their father left

10:39.439 --> 10:41.985
saying he would come back,

10:42.009 --> 10:44.754
that he was gonna
return to Mexico,

10:44.778 --> 10:47.223
he was gonna return to this
little island where he grew up.

10:47.247 --> 10:50.894
I looked at Indra and then I
looked at Eduardo and Eugenio

10:50.918 --> 10:54.964
and I knew that I had
to be there for them

10:54.988 --> 10:59.703
and make the best of a
difficult situation.

10:59.727 --> 11:02.262
She's a very spiritual
woman, my mom

11:03.931 --> 11:07.300
and she founded a spiritual
community in LA.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.189
Almost the entire community
moved to Montana,

11:20.213 --> 11:21.725
I'm talking hundreds of people.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.392
There was definitely
like singing

11:23.416 --> 11:26.229
about being Montana bound.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.732
We welcome you to the heart

11:28.756 --> 11:32.168
and we sing the
song of gratitude.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.862
Here, oh universe,
I am grateful.

11:38.331 --> 11:41.410
I just kind of think
growing up that way

11:41.434 --> 11:43.079
is a privilege.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.949
There's others that
saw our community,

11:45.973 --> 11:48.184
definitely thought it
was a little weird.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.187
I always tell my mom
that was the best move

11:51.211 --> 11:52.255
she could've ever done

11:52.279 --> 11:54.390
was getting us here.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.525
For me it was almost
like we moved

11:56.549 --> 12:00.463
into the set of a National
Geographic magazine.

12:00.487 --> 12:05.101
The mountains had their own
special magical allure

12:05.125 --> 12:07.227
for a child's imagination.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.340
We would spend our summers

12:11.364 --> 12:12.776
fishing in Yellowstone,

12:12.800 --> 12:14.234
running into the hills.

12:15.836 --> 12:18.047
I definitely took to
that very quickly

12:18.071 --> 12:19.873
and made it my home.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.514
Hello, Ed.

12:29.549 --> 12:30.860
Hey.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.528
No, we're filming this for

12:32.552 --> 12:35.431
just documenting my
recovery for us.

12:35.455 --> 12:36.465
Cool.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.201
Yeah.

12:38.225 --> 12:43.006
It's pretty hard for
a YouTube video.

12:43.030 --> 12:47.310
I saw it as part of the
recovery process to film.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.445
It was really important to me

12:49.469 --> 12:51.347
that he didn't come out
the other end of it

12:51.371 --> 12:53.950
and be like, why did
you sign that way,

12:53.974 --> 12:55.051
why did you sign this way,

12:55.075 --> 12:56.920
and not really understand.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.454
So we would go in

12:58.478 --> 12:59.798
and raise up all
these loose edges

12:59.822 --> 13:01.024
and free them up

13:01.048 --> 13:02.358
so that they can come together

13:02.382 --> 13:05.895
and allow this hair to
shift to this area.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.864
Okay, and you think my eyebrows

13:07.888 --> 13:08.968
are gonna be all like this?

13:08.992 --> 13:10.133
I hope not.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.835
Also for Ed,

13:11.859 --> 13:15.604
filming actually kind of
gave him something to do.

13:15.628 --> 13:20.343
See you later, I'm going to
get my head wound closed up.

13:20.367 --> 13:23.179
I'm just kind of coming
out of anesthesia.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.314
You want to look at me, Ed?

13:25.338 --> 13:26.338
Very cool.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.517
Ready Jennifer?

13:28.541 --> 13:30.019
I'm ready.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.354
When you're in the hospital,

13:31.378 --> 13:32.555
every day is the same.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.090
Everything's getting better

13:34.114 --> 13:35.959
but it's very slowly
getting better.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.895
Is it video, filming right now?

13:38.919 --> 13:40.329
Mm-hmm.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.430
You close enough?

13:41.454 --> 13:42.598
Yep.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.133
I think you should be closer.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.101
Want to turn the light on more?

13:45.125 --> 13:46.069
No, I'm good.

13:46.093 --> 13:46.936
You're good?

13:46.960 --> 13:48.171
You sure?

13:48.195 --> 13:49.438
It just gave a focus

13:49.462 --> 13:50.974
on something other
than just the fact

13:50.998 --> 13:52.318
that we're in a
freaking hospital.

13:52.342 --> 13:53.410
Yes, I got it!

13:55.268 --> 13:56.980
Nailed that sucker!

13:57.004 --> 14:00.073
I've been trying that
for like 10 times.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.152
I'll help you.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.387
God it's cold.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.255
Hurry up.

14:06.279 --> 14:09.492
I didn't have a dad growing up.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.461
There was really no one
looking over us saying,

14:12.485 --> 14:14.063
"Don't do that or
don't do this."

14:14.087 --> 14:15.631
It was really our
world to discover

14:15.655 --> 14:19.326
and make our own mistakes
and learn from them.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.606
I just remember that
they were both crazy

14:23.630 --> 14:27.576
and having them both
together was chaos.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.345
Yeah man, what's up with you?

14:29.369 --> 14:30.546
Hey, bitch, come on.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.605
Yeah, you think you're bad.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.451
They had a lot of energy.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.453
I tried the best I could

14:37.477 --> 14:40.056
to keep Eddie in line.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.591
I guess my educational history

14:42.615 --> 14:44.994
is kicked out of nine
different schools

14:45.018 --> 14:47.696
starting with preschool,
disruptive behavior.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.334
First grade was for
filling condoms with piss

14:51.358 --> 14:52.936
and throwing them
down the hallway.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.404
I started a fire in
the boy's bathroom

14:55.428 --> 14:57.306
so I got kicked out
of that school.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.208
Got into a fight,

14:59.232 --> 15:01.377
we kind of both got kicked
out in that situation

15:01.401 --> 15:05.014
but I think he was
leading the charge.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.716
Eugene, he was 11 years old,

15:07.740 --> 15:09.685
never even thought about
not having a father

15:09.709 --> 15:11.269
and he goes, "I need
to meet my father."

15:11.293 --> 15:13.957
And she said, "Okay."

15:13.981 --> 15:15.358
And within months,

15:15.382 --> 15:17.526
it was literally that fast.

15:17.550 --> 15:20.320
Where's dad and then
we're in Mexico.

15:22.055 --> 15:26.002
All I knew is he was this
incredibly dark, tanned

15:26.026 --> 15:27.336
pirate looking figure

15:27.360 --> 15:30.039
that fished for
sharks and lobster

15:30.063 --> 15:33.542
and lived this crazy
jungle lifestyle.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.644
He was like a hero.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.113
It was idyllic,

15:37.137 --> 15:39.148
me and my twin brother
running around

15:39.172 --> 15:41.017
just having a blast.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.485
Hi, mom.

15:42.509 --> 15:43.509
Hi, guys.

15:55.188 --> 15:58.058
We decided to get
together again.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.640
We went through a lot of
changes, a lot of changes,

16:04.664 --> 16:08.411
and then me becoming
pregnant with Ellie

16:08.435 --> 16:11.071
and integrating into a family.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.054
The first time my dad's actually

16:18.078 --> 16:20.156
gotten to make a snowball.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.125
I don't know if he
expected himself

16:22.149 --> 16:24.360
to play dad all of a sudden.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.586
Hey, dad, no, don't throw it!

16:30.434 --> 16:31.434
Say hi.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.768
Hi.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.370
And we're gonna go
say hi to Eduardo

16:34.394 --> 16:35.704
who's having lunch

16:35.728 --> 16:39.066
and he does not know
that dad is here.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.545
It's a surprise.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.080
He doesn't know you're here.

16:44.104 --> 16:48.151
No (speaking in Spanish).

16:48.175 --> 16:49.175
Whistle, whistle.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.165
Hey, how you doing?

17:02.189 --> 17:03.232
How you doing?

17:03.256 --> 17:06.326
Thank you, thank you to be here.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.752
For many years, he
wasn't really my dad,

17:24.777 --> 17:26.454
he was a friend.

17:26.479 --> 17:29.092
Watch it, don't break the line.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.194
Don't break the line.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.120
It's a big fish, wow.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.323
It's big fish.

17:37.657 --> 17:38.657
Ha ha!

17:41.228 --> 17:44.107
At 13, I started using drugs

17:44.131 --> 17:47.710
and then I started smoking
cigarettes with my dad

17:47.734 --> 17:49.245
and doing drugs with my dad

17:49.269 --> 17:50.279
and drinking with my dad

17:50.303 --> 17:52.215
and he becomes my best friend

17:52.239 --> 17:54.817
because he's not telling me no.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.386
And I was already
hanging with a crew

17:57.410 --> 18:00.123
that was tripping on
acid and doing coke

18:00.147 --> 18:01.757
and everything else.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.293
When Eduardo was 17,

18:04.317 --> 18:06.129
he sat at the kitchen
table and he said,

18:06.153 --> 18:09.732
"I realize that my habits
were hurting my family."

18:09.756 --> 18:12.201
So I'm tired of living
in the shadows of lies

18:12.225 --> 18:15.638
and I just want to
level the field here

18:15.662 --> 18:18.407
and me, Euge, Indra, dad,

18:18.431 --> 18:21.677
we've been using drugs for
years behind your back, mom.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.403
I mean, I was livid.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.482
And I think for Eduardo

18:26.506 --> 18:28.875
going straight was essential.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.522
I decided if I want to
make an impact in life,

18:33.546 --> 18:35.424
I needed to get to business,

18:35.448 --> 18:36.859
I need to get to work,

18:36.883 --> 18:40.363
I need to be
purposeful in my life.

18:40.387 --> 18:44.833
I had already been cooking in
restaurants since I was 15.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.935
And then I decided
culinary school

18:46.959 --> 18:49.638
was going to be where
I put all my energy

18:49.662 --> 18:51.740
and through that,

18:51.764 --> 18:56.379
I wanted to discover
my potential

18:56.403 --> 18:59.215
on my own without substances.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.940
Eduardo Garcia.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.395
Danielle, you want to
see something cool?

19:12.419 --> 19:13.729
Come here.

19:13.753 --> 19:14.597
Yeah, this is pretty cool.

19:14.621 --> 19:15.964
So, this is lefty,

19:15.988 --> 19:16.832
you now lefty, Danielle?

19:16.856 --> 19:18.334
Yeah.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.998
I can feel all my fingers
still over there

19:20.022 --> 19:21.337
even though they're not there.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.230
That's my thumb moving,

19:24.431 --> 19:26.199
this is my pinky moving.

19:27.767 --> 19:31.414
Maybe I'll be able to
get a prosthetic limb

19:31.438 --> 19:35.318
that has like some
kind of sensors.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.662
I don't want the ones that are
supposed to look like hands.

19:37.686 --> 19:41.857
I want like cool, custom made
like hardwood cherry hands

19:41.881 --> 19:44.960
or oak or like titanium, I
don't know, something cool.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.395
Antler.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.588
Fucking yeah, antler, like bone,

19:50.723 --> 19:52.335
kinda cool.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.502
That's awesome.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.371
That is awesome.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.440
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.675
Only time I was worried for him

19:59.699 --> 20:02.478
was when he had his
chest operation

20:02.502 --> 20:06.449
because they'd never done
anything like it before.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.884
With the rib, you
can't just cut it off

20:08.908 --> 20:11.320
and leave a hole in the chest.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.655
What we have to do

20:12.679 --> 20:14.823
is try to find ways
to cover that up.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.759
So we had like the burn team,

20:16.783 --> 20:17.760
the plastic surgeon team,

20:17.784 --> 20:19.562
the cardiothoracic team,

20:19.586 --> 20:20.996
everybody around the bed

20:21.020 --> 20:23.299
just kind of brainstorming
essentially

20:23.323 --> 20:25.000
what muscle they could
take from where.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.669
Everything that's dead.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.305
- Gotta go. Gotta go, yeah.

20:29.329 --> 20:32.841
That may leave you with a
hole on your chest this big.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.610
Yes, sir.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.679
Like kind of stick my
head in it kind of.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.447
Yes, sir.

20:38.471 --> 20:41.984
The likelihood of you doing
pull ups again is zero.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.319
Pull ups again.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.687
- Ever, ever.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.289
You're gonna have,

20:46.313 --> 20:48.948
your lat's gonna be
turned around to here.

20:54.687 --> 20:59.335
I just wrapped up a
very successful year

20:59.359 --> 21:00.469
as a yacht chef,

21:00.493 --> 21:01.994
11 years of hard work.

21:04.464 --> 21:07.009
My way of cooking as a
professional yacht chef

21:07.033 --> 21:08.377
really became: get there,

21:08.401 --> 21:10.078
figure out what's in the market,

21:10.102 --> 21:11.614
what's local, what's in season

21:11.638 --> 21:15.375
and then figure out how
to put it together.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.379
Definitely developing as a chef.

21:21.881 --> 21:24.527
You're going around the world.

21:24.551 --> 21:26.762
There were all kinds
of adventures.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.565
It kickstarted a time of life

21:29.589 --> 21:31.534
where I was accountable
to myself only

21:31.558 --> 21:34.603
and myself was interested in
letting loose a little bit.

21:34.627 --> 21:38.073
So that is what
brought me into hey,

21:38.097 --> 21:40.376
been six, seven years
since I've had a beer,

21:40.400 --> 21:44.504
hmm, there's a drink being
passed around, yeah, why not?

21:46.038 --> 21:48.617
I remember sitting on the
couch at the crew house

21:48.641 --> 21:49.652
when Jen walked in

21:49.676 --> 21:52.020
and where we connected

21:52.044 --> 21:55.023
was she was game to have fun.

21:55.047 --> 21:59.061
I wanted to go surf five a.m.
and be at work by eight.

21:59.085 --> 22:01.564
Hand went up, she's
like, "I'm in."

22:01.588 --> 22:03.666
Most people just wanted
to go to the bars.

22:03.690 --> 22:06.034
He was the only
person on the yacht

22:06.058 --> 22:07.658
that liked to surf and
run and skateboard

22:07.682 --> 22:09.972
and all the things I like to do.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.874
And we started hanging out more.

22:11.898 --> 22:14.910
And then we started dating.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.613
She was keen to dance, to play,

22:17.637 --> 22:19.439
to express, to live.

22:28.881 --> 22:31.093
Ed's walking.

22:31.117 --> 22:33.996
I think I felt a responsibility

22:34.020 --> 22:35.764
to be tougher than
I should have been

22:35.788 --> 22:38.100
because of how hard everyone
was working around me.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.002
Okay ready? Turn around.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.546
There's gonna be
someone else out there

22:41.570 --> 22:43.081
that has it worse than you do.

22:43.105 --> 22:45.508
Just be grateful for
what you do have.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.009
Everything feel okay?

22:47.033 --> 22:49.512
Yeah, I wish I could
use this sucker.

22:49.536 --> 22:50.536
You can yeah.

22:51.481 --> 22:52.481
Pretend.

22:52.505 --> 22:53.916
Yeah.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.784
Gotta pretend he's
doing something.

22:55.808 --> 22:58.678
That sucker has no
free rides, man.

23:01.725 --> 23:02.725
Thanks.

23:02.749 --> 23:03.792
You done?

23:03.816 --> 23:05.027
No, I'm not done.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.629
I'm just saying thanks.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.531
I appreciate it.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.022
No problem.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.168
This is my new
typing attachment.

23:13.192 --> 23:14.937
Gonna help me just do
some simple typing

23:14.961 --> 23:18.498
until I get my prosthetic
in, kinda cool.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.178
I never felt a fear for my life.

23:23.202 --> 23:27.115
I felt anxiety about
everyday matters of life,

23:27.139 --> 23:28.717
how I'd get back to life.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.486
This is awesome.

23:30.510 --> 23:31.544
That's great.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.125
I think hiking is gonna be

23:37.149 --> 23:40.453
some of the best
therapy I'll ever do.

23:52.699 --> 23:55.768
You know, how am I
going to be me again?

24:11.618 --> 24:14.597
Not to be funny but
this is my first stab

24:14.621 --> 24:16.231
at working with a prosthetic

24:16.255 --> 24:18.625
or any attachment on lefty.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.210
Works.

24:28.234 --> 24:31.079
And Jen invented,
show the camera, Jen.

24:31.103 --> 24:33.048
Basically it's
this two foot fork

24:33.072 --> 24:35.818
and one end's for scratching,
one end's for eating,

24:35.842 --> 24:37.677
do not confuse the two.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.614
Thank you. Well done you.

24:43.249 --> 24:45.694
I know it's kind
of weird for you.

24:45.718 --> 24:50.132
Not just kind of weird,
very, very messed up

24:50.156 --> 24:54.637
but well done you for hanging
in there 37 days with me

24:54.661 --> 24:58.631
and not abandoning me for
some other whatever.

25:07.173 --> 25:11.277
I wonder if I can just launch
this carrot at my face.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.046
Oh, yeah.

25:16.315 --> 25:18.727
We had this amazing relationship

25:18.751 --> 25:20.062
but I had two minds,

25:20.086 --> 25:21.697
part of me was telling me

25:21.721 --> 25:23.566
that Eduardo was the
most amazing guy ever

25:23.590 --> 25:25.801
and then the other part of
my brain was just telling me

25:25.825 --> 25:29.037
that something was going
on, he was disingenuous.

25:29.061 --> 25:31.173
He just said that
I was paranoid,

25:31.197 --> 25:32.841
that I should shut up,

25:32.865 --> 25:35.711
that all of his friends
thought I was a mean person

25:35.735 --> 25:37.780
for even suggesting
such a thing.

25:37.804 --> 25:40.048
And I didn't make the connection

25:40.072 --> 25:42.585
that me cheating on
her would somehow

25:42.609 --> 25:45.921
subconsciously speak to her.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.156
And I don't remember
how I said it,

25:48.180 --> 25:52.661
I remember sitting on the
port side of the yacht

25:52.685 --> 25:54.153
and just spitting it out

25:55.855 --> 25:57.766
like there was this time,
there was that time,

25:57.790 --> 25:59.390
there was this time,
there was that time.

25:59.414 --> 26:01.637
And then I was just
destroyed, I think,

26:01.661 --> 26:04.640
because it wasn't this
kind of like one off thing

26:04.664 --> 26:08.911
it was actually kind of two
years of complete lies.

26:08.935 --> 26:10.879
He's been cheating
on me basically

26:10.903 --> 26:12.915
for most of our relationship,

26:12.939 --> 26:14.106
that just hurt.

26:16.709 --> 26:20.022
It was a recurrence of that
same time when I was 17

26:20.046 --> 26:24.092
like shit, how have my
actions become actions

26:24.116 --> 26:27.062
that are hurting people,

26:27.086 --> 26:29.622
not who I want to be in life.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.401
It was time to clean up my act.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.204
I came home for seven months,

26:36.228 --> 26:40.709
no drugs, no alcohol, just a
lot of time in the outdoors,

26:40.733 --> 26:42.711
a lot of time working.

26:42.735 --> 26:45.748
I was so depressed,

26:45.772 --> 26:47.206
so physically ill.

26:49.909 --> 26:52.921
I had this cabin in Montana
that was really rough

26:52.945 --> 26:54.957
and I remember fixing
up the interior

26:54.981 --> 26:57.960
with a goal that maybe
Jen'll come back to Montana,

26:57.984 --> 26:59.662
no expectations,

26:59.686 --> 27:02.798
I don't need you to get
back together with me.

27:02.822 --> 27:03.799
Despite everything,

27:03.823 --> 27:05.000
you love who you love

27:05.024 --> 27:07.235
and I wanted to be there for him

27:07.259 --> 27:10.196
and help him get
through everything.

27:16.102 --> 27:18.213
It was the first time

27:18.237 --> 27:21.173
her and I had been in the
same space clean and clear.

27:23.943 --> 27:26.789
He was definitely
trying to show me

27:26.813 --> 27:30.025
that he was somebody that
now did actually care.

27:30.049 --> 27:32.695
So when I have my
ridiculous photo ideas

27:32.719 --> 27:34.020
he was up for that.

27:37.356 --> 27:40.268
When we start talking
about something

27:40.292 --> 27:43.105
and we're both into
it, it's unstoppable

27:43.129 --> 27:45.898
the amount of ideas
that come out.

27:49.268 --> 27:52.214
I left my full time career as
a yacht chef after a decade

27:52.238 --> 27:56.418
and I was ready for
a career change.

27:56.442 --> 27:59.779
Together with Jen, my
brother, my sister,

28:01.313 --> 28:05.260
we started a food company
called Montana Mex.

28:05.284 --> 28:06.361
And on top of that,

28:06.385 --> 28:07.963
we started planning

28:07.987 --> 28:10.498
for Eduardo to have a
outdoor cooking show.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.300
Rolling.

28:12.324 --> 28:15.003
We're just on a
rampage of creativity

28:15.027 --> 28:16.896
and it was super fun.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.876
That's when I got to know Jen,

28:20.900 --> 28:22.140
like the business part of Jen,

28:22.164 --> 28:23.812
the intellectual part of Jen,

28:23.836 --> 28:24.876
the creative part of Jen,

28:24.900 --> 28:27.015
the challenging parts of Jen.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.041
Look how big our ducks are.

28:30.943 --> 28:34.847
That was the beginning of
our friendship for sure.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.318
And I put this on it

28:41.153 --> 28:46.935
because otherwise
when I'm in bed

28:46.959 --> 28:48.971
it will just keep me up.

28:48.995 --> 28:51.006
You've been doing it that
same way every night?

28:51.030 --> 28:51.974
Yeah.

28:51.998 --> 28:53.341
Really?

28:53.365 --> 28:55.878
Yeah. I don't know, I don't feel

28:55.902 --> 28:57.822
like I need to sleep in a
real bed at all really,

28:57.846 --> 28:58.846
it's fine.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.784
It was a very bizarre situation

29:01.808 --> 29:03.518
'cause you're trying
to care for somebody

29:03.542 --> 29:05.320
who is going through
the pit of hell

29:05.344 --> 29:06.354
but at the same time,

29:06.378 --> 29:07.956
I also had all these things

29:07.980 --> 29:10.358
from obviously the relationship

29:10.382 --> 29:12.952
that Ed and I had previously.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.030
Did you make it?

29:15.054 --> 29:16.031
No, it was so close.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.033
It landed right side up.

29:18.057 --> 29:19.534
Try it again, try it again.

29:19.558 --> 29:21.794
Ugh, that's even worse.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.574
Obviously annoys me at
times but I love him,

29:26.598 --> 29:28.968
I've loved him a long time.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.005
I will always love him.

29:39.946 --> 29:42.414
Please breathe in and
hold your breath.

29:47.119 --> 29:50.132
Start breathing again.

29:50.156 --> 29:53.101
The testicle that
had been damaged

29:53.125 --> 29:56.004
from the electrical
injury was not viable

29:56.028 --> 29:58.140
and there was no way for
us to help it survive.

29:58.164 --> 30:01.109
So that's discussion number
one that we're having

30:01.133 --> 30:04.312
with a young healthy
guy and his family

30:04.336 --> 30:08.350
about it is our recommendation
that we do this.

30:08.374 --> 30:09.484
For whatever reason,

30:09.508 --> 30:11.053
he chose me to be the signer.

30:11.077 --> 30:12.888
Especially because of
the cheating thing,

30:12.912 --> 30:14.389
it's like almost hilarious

30:14.413 --> 30:17.025
this sense that the ex
girlfriend that was cheated on

30:17.049 --> 30:18.994
got to sign away his testicle.

30:19.018 --> 30:21.263
Your charts look good,
your blood looks good,

30:21.287 --> 30:23.899
you kind of went through
the basic and then

30:23.923 --> 30:26.068
but we got some bad news.

30:26.092 --> 30:28.136
The pathology report pops up

30:28.160 --> 30:32.031
and low and behold there's
a testicular cancer.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.011
Are you kidding me?

30:36.035 --> 30:40.048
My focus right now is figuring
out how to be an amputee,

30:40.072 --> 30:42.284
other surgeries
that are ongoing,

30:42.308 --> 30:45.553
picking myself up out of the
ground for the most part

30:45.577 --> 30:50.025
and on top of that you're
asking me to deal with cancer?

30:50.049 --> 30:51.209
And that's when they realized

30:51.233 --> 30:52.627
it was second stage

30:52.651 --> 30:55.964
because he had a tumor halfway
up his spine as well.

30:55.988 --> 30:59.234
Any chance to see that
tumor clot on my?

30:59.258 --> 31:00.302
Yeah.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.570
That's big, man.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.239
Basically

31:04.263 --> 31:06.183
they couldn't do all the
reconstructive surgeries

31:06.207 --> 31:09.544
because he needed to get not
chemotherapy immediately

31:09.568 --> 31:11.113
before it went to his brain.

31:11.137 --> 31:13.515
So...

31:13.539 --> 31:16.084
I forgot one.

31:16.108 --> 31:19.187
It just became my
norm being in ICU,

31:19.211 --> 31:21.056
you know what I mean?

31:21.080 --> 31:22.314
It became my norm.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.094
How do you feel?

31:26.118 --> 31:27.595
Mechanical.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.064
But in a cool way?

31:29.088 --> 31:30.589
Yeah, I think so.

31:31.657 --> 31:33.535
I think I was actually terrified

31:33.559 --> 31:35.327
to leave the hospital.

31:38.297 --> 31:41.376
The doctors in the burn unit

31:41.400 --> 31:47.015
decided I was healthy
enough to go home

31:47.039 --> 31:49.008
or leave the hospital today.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.511
So we packed up our stuff

31:54.380 --> 31:57.192
and put it in the truck.

31:57.216 --> 32:00.186
Pretty amazing that
we're out of here,

32:02.488 --> 32:05.191
pretty fucking
glad I didn't die.

32:11.197 --> 32:13.099
I don't have my left hand.

32:17.169 --> 32:20.406
But otherwise we're in
really great shape,

32:21.540 --> 32:23.242
really great shape.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.159
I think I got over there

32:31.183 --> 32:33.361
two or three days after
he was discharged

32:33.385 --> 32:37.265
and I worried about them both.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.766
Although they were
pulling together,

32:38.790 --> 32:41.336
there was an atmosphere

32:41.360 --> 32:44.006
because they were
both so exhausted,

32:44.030 --> 32:45.264
both so exhausted.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.318
We didn't know what
to do for Christmas

32:56.342 --> 32:59.587
and I think I'll
never, ever forget

32:59.611 --> 33:03.649
the fact that we decided to
go to Arches National Park

33:06.218 --> 33:09.564
and it was just unbelievable

33:09.588 --> 33:10.765
when I could see Ed's face

33:10.789 --> 33:13.468
thinking that even he had said

33:13.492 --> 33:16.228
he never thought
that would happen.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.507
What's happening now?

33:19.531 --> 33:22.210
Let's check it out,
let's check it out.

33:22.234 --> 33:25.447
Just stay shoulders right
over your feet, okay?

33:25.471 --> 33:27.582
Yeah, you're good,
it's no problem.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.608
Look at Jen and your feet.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.521
Then they got me
across this high thing

33:33.545 --> 33:36.724
that was so steep I didn't
think I'd get across

33:36.748 --> 33:38.226
but he said, "No,
you're scared",

33:38.250 --> 33:40.128
"we'll get you across this."

33:40.152 --> 33:41.396
Take it like that,

33:41.420 --> 33:43.198
two, three steps
at a time, pause,

33:43.222 --> 33:45.333
two, three, don't think
of it as a big wall,

33:45.357 --> 33:47.359
okay, very good, very good.

33:48.427 --> 33:49.837
You did great.

33:49.861 --> 33:53.232
That was, this is
just fear, isn't it?

33:55.501 --> 33:57.345
He'd survived,

33:57.369 --> 33:59.289
nothing else, the fact
that he'd survived through

33:59.313 --> 34:00.882
in a wonderful place.

34:01.607 --> 34:04.786
She's insane, huh?

34:04.810 --> 34:09.357
Ed was, even at that
very short space

34:09.380 --> 34:11.659
that he'd been out of hospital,

34:11.683 --> 34:13.402
no one would guess that
he was going through

34:13.427 --> 34:14.795
what he was going through.

34:19.824 --> 34:23.271
I don't remember the
day I arrived home.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.572
It must have been
momentous in that sense

34:25.597 --> 34:28.275
but I don't remember walking in

34:28.300 --> 34:29.610
to my house for the first time

34:29.635 --> 34:31.337
and opening the door.

34:32.904 --> 34:35.841
What I remember was
wanting to hide,

34:37.309 --> 34:39.286
I don't even know why.

34:39.311 --> 34:41.556
Locally I live in a
small community.

34:41.580 --> 34:44.626
They knew I had
been electrocuted.

34:44.650 --> 34:47.129
You couldn't hide that
I was missing a hand

34:47.152 --> 34:48.163
but you know what,

34:48.187 --> 34:49.164
I could hide the fact

34:49.188 --> 34:51.590
that I was going through cancer.

34:52.824 --> 34:57.772
Today is February the seventh

34:57.796 --> 35:01.576
and it's official, my
hair is falling out.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.600
Bucket.

35:06.205 --> 35:07.739
You see that?

35:09.508 --> 35:13.388
Bink, how disgusting.

35:13.412 --> 35:18.160
Bink, bink, oh my.

35:18.184 --> 35:20.162
Jen, do you want to try this?

35:20.186 --> 35:20.862
You might enjoy it.

35:20.886 --> 35:22.330
I will.

35:22.354 --> 35:23.598
Holy, look at that.

35:23.622 --> 35:26.658
I can make a bald patch.

35:28.394 --> 35:30.372
Hey, baby, do it systematically.

35:30.396 --> 35:31.806
I'm turning you into my dad.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.241
Look at you.

35:33.265 --> 35:35.877
This is just like my dad.

35:35.901 --> 35:37.345
Does it not hurt at all?

35:37.369 --> 35:39.481
This is excellent fun.

35:39.505 --> 35:42.741
No, if it hurt, I would
ask you to stop.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.177
It hurts a little.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.390
Grab a clump and
just go for it but.

35:48.414 --> 35:49.414
Pink.

35:50.649 --> 35:53.628
It's literally
like having a cat.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.222
You've always wanted a cat.

36:17.576 --> 36:18.753
How are you doing?

36:18.777 --> 36:20.612
I'm hanging in there.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.451
It's been a long week.

36:27.486 --> 36:30.722
Pretty nauseous almost
every day this week

36:31.890 --> 36:34.236
but we're hanging in there.

36:34.260 --> 36:36.338
I'm getting my pick
line taken out today

36:36.362 --> 36:37.496
so it'll be nice.

36:42.934 --> 36:44.470
Happy?

36:45.571 --> 36:46.738
Yeah, thanks.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.776
You're welcome.

36:52.844 --> 36:55.547
Back on Monday, Monday at noon.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.364
When he was going
through everything

37:02.388 --> 37:05.333
the priority was get
him rehabilitated

37:05.357 --> 37:07.359
and get him back to life.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.472
But further down the list

37:10.496 --> 37:13.575
is what is the deal with our
relationship as a whole?

37:13.599 --> 37:17.044
How are we gonna get out
of this as friends?

37:17.068 --> 37:19.838
What's gonna happen
in the future?

37:37.989 --> 37:39.667
The doubt didn't start

37:39.691 --> 37:43.495
until I tried actually
getting back to life again.

37:47.533 --> 37:50.378
All of a sudden overnight
at 30 years old,

37:50.402 --> 37:53.905
I had to rethink how to
do every single task.

37:57.509 --> 38:01.547
Ashes is one of my favorite
place to hike anywhere.

38:05.717 --> 38:09.821
You now had my mom, Jen, my
sister, my brother, my dad,

38:11.457 --> 38:14.769
take a bear spray,
don't hike alone.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.496
Really concerned
about my ability

38:19.565 --> 38:22.834
to be the guy I was a
few months before.

38:28.407 --> 38:29.784
Ed losing his hand

38:29.808 --> 38:31.686
is really something
that everybody sees

38:31.710 --> 38:33.788
but not many people know

38:33.812 --> 38:36.458
that he also lost so
much of his muscle mass

38:36.482 --> 38:38.626
from his torso, from his
legs, from his arms.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.127
The fact is that he operates

38:40.151 --> 38:43.422
with way less muscle
than most of us do.

38:47.493 --> 38:49.604
It's such a horrible
thing, you know,

38:49.628 --> 38:51.373
to have someone care for you

38:51.397 --> 38:54.576
and for you to think,
"Hey back off",

38:54.600 --> 38:58.880
I need a moment to see
if I can do this again.

38:58.904 --> 39:01.707
"Give me a second
to fail on my own."

39:15.120 --> 39:17.632
I think what a lot of
people see with recovery

39:17.656 --> 39:22.169
is this grand coming out
of oh I'm recovered

39:22.193 --> 39:24.972
and actually it isn't that.

39:24.996 --> 39:27.174
It's this kind of
never-ending process

39:27.198 --> 39:29.601
of a million little
achievements.

39:30.569 --> 39:32.480
Undoing these knots

39:32.504 --> 39:35.783
is definitely proving to
be a little more difficult

39:35.807 --> 39:38.420
but I don't think undoing knots

39:38.444 --> 39:41.423
is ever easy for anybody.

39:41.447 --> 39:42.548
There it goes.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.085
That's a deer.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.505
I love to hike for elk antlers

39:57.529 --> 39:59.707
and my goal was I want
to be able to hike

39:59.731 --> 40:02.076
a solid eight miles
into the back country

40:02.100 --> 40:04.102
and feel strong about it.

40:08.674 --> 40:11.619
Being outdoors was
my recovery, 110%

40:11.643 --> 40:13.721
and that was where I,

40:13.745 --> 40:15.657
it was my way of rehabilitating.

40:15.681 --> 40:17.483
That's a heavy pack.

40:33.231 --> 40:34.942
I would get home at 5 p.m.

40:34.966 --> 40:37.479
and there'd be a race.

40:37.503 --> 40:40.915
If I couldn't get a meal
under my belt by six,

40:40.939 --> 40:44.752
I would be too sick
to cook a meal,

40:44.776 --> 40:46.678
I would lose all interest.

40:48.213 --> 40:49.824
I guess as a bonus,

40:49.848 --> 40:51.626
I don't have to worry

40:51.650 --> 40:53.528
about cutting the fingers

40:53.552 --> 40:56.197
off of my left hand anymore
when I'm chopping.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.833
I'd be pretty crushed if
I couldn't cook anymore,

40:58.857 --> 41:00.091
be pretty crushed.

41:03.829 --> 41:06.808
It was only until I
actually started

41:06.832 --> 41:09.511
getting back into
trying to cook again

41:09.535 --> 41:11.112
that it all started to click.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.980
I'm like, "Wait a minute",

41:13.004 --> 41:15.216
my career is built off of the
ability to work quickly,

41:15.240 --> 41:17.084
efficiently with my hands.

41:17.108 --> 41:21.580
"Fuck, I got one
hand and a forearm."

41:27.853 --> 41:29.588
That's hot.

41:42.934 --> 41:45.713
We knew that my
chemotherapy treatments

41:45.737 --> 41:47.148
would be a three-month ordeal

41:47.172 --> 41:48.816
and we just had to survive that

41:48.840 --> 41:53.721
and the day it ended my
focus immediately shifted

41:53.745 --> 41:56.157
to, "Okay, let's get
back to recovery."

41:56.181 --> 41:57.659
We've got a long list of things

41:57.683 --> 41:59.851
"that still need to be healed."

42:11.797 --> 42:13.841
Do you want to
describe what was here

42:13.865 --> 42:15.834
when you were electrocuted?

42:20.939 --> 42:24.109
Not a big box with
working locks on it.

42:27.245 --> 42:31.793
I'd have probably stumbled
straight down here.

42:31.817 --> 42:33.227
Let's see if it goes to a road.

42:33.251 --> 42:35.062
Yeah, you want to follow it?

42:35.086 --> 42:37.098
- Yeah. Okay.

42:37.122 --> 42:39.591
I don't know if I saw
some of these trees.

42:41.192 --> 42:43.662
Incredible, I can't remember.

42:48.634 --> 42:53.314
I didn't like being up there
standing next to that box.

42:53.338 --> 42:54.338
It was hard.

42:57.976 --> 43:01.789
Trying not to feel anger
through this whole event

43:01.813 --> 43:04.258
and then you go back to the
site where you nearly died

43:04.282 --> 43:05.893
and you're looking at it

43:05.917 --> 43:08.996
and it's...

43:09.020 --> 43:12.967
locked up, posted, sealed,

43:12.991 --> 43:17.138
huge padlocks, shut down, safe.

43:17.162 --> 43:18.405
That's how it should've been

43:18.429 --> 43:20.808
when I was up here hiking.

43:20.832 --> 43:22.644
That's how it should've been.

43:22.668 --> 43:24.770
It angered me to see that.

43:30.241 --> 43:33.178
One tiny event can
rock you so hard.

43:39.417 --> 43:42.363
I didn't feel a need to
stay there for too long,

43:42.387 --> 43:43.388
it turned me.

44:07.312 --> 44:08.312
Hello.

44:17.222 --> 44:19.033
Dad, you're here
early though, man.

44:19.057 --> 44:20.057
Huh?

44:22.828 --> 44:24.772
I was totally joking with dad

44:24.796 --> 44:27.032
but I guess he's here to work.

44:28.399 --> 44:29.701
That's harder.

44:38.043 --> 44:39.386
Isn't that weird?

44:39.410 --> 44:41.889
You see the circulation
missing in that finger?

44:41.913 --> 44:44.726
It just gets, they get cold.

44:44.750 --> 44:47.729
I think there's nerve
damage or something.

44:47.753 --> 44:48.930
The scar's healing nicely.

44:48.954 --> 44:50.297
Yeah.

44:50.321 --> 44:52.033
I'm glad it's got nice and flat.

44:52.057 --> 44:52.900
Try to open it up a little bit.

44:52.924 --> 44:53.935
That's better,

44:53.959 --> 44:54.902
you got some blood to it now.

44:54.926 --> 44:55.803
Good job, Indra.

44:55.827 --> 44:57.204
Yeah.

44:57.228 --> 44:58.472
When we were in the hospital,

44:58.496 --> 45:00.174
Indra and I,

45:00.198 --> 45:02.476
we'd like shamelessly get
out all of our paperwork

45:02.500 --> 45:05.012
and we'd be running our company.

45:05.036 --> 45:07.514
Let's make sure that our company

45:07.538 --> 45:09.984
doesn't go completely under.

45:10.008 --> 45:11.418
We've got stuff to do,

45:11.442 --> 45:13.287
we've got stuff that
needs to happen,

45:13.311 --> 45:17.415
we have things that need to
not be lost because of this.

45:26.992 --> 45:29.327
That will come off.

45:30.962 --> 45:32.730
There you go.

45:36.802 --> 45:39.280
That's pretty cool.

45:39.304 --> 45:40.181
So how you gonna trigger it?

45:40.205 --> 45:41.482
Just bring it up.

45:41.506 --> 45:43.250
Oh, just click it on your cheek.

45:43.274 --> 45:44.318
Oh, there you go.

45:44.342 --> 45:45.352
Yeah.

45:45.376 --> 45:46.788
Alright.

45:46.812 --> 45:49.090
There was one online
for 1,100 bucks

45:49.114 --> 45:51.058
and I figured we could make one

45:51.082 --> 45:54.495
so it's like I'm $33
into it right now.

45:54.519 --> 45:58.857
And exactly, and Montana style.

46:31.156 --> 46:35.060
I mean, I think we could tweak
it maybe a little more but,

46:38.263 --> 46:39.297
You got this?

46:56.414 --> 46:57.414
Jesus.

47:06.057 --> 47:09.904
Alright, step one.

47:09.928 --> 47:12.073
I like it.

47:12.097 --> 47:14.641
Super lightweight, super
strong, it's cleanable.

47:14.665 --> 47:16.143
It's just a...

47:16.167 --> 47:17.527
You guys are doing
this right here?

47:17.551 --> 47:18.394
This is what we're
about to build?

47:18.418 --> 47:19.113
Yeah.

47:19.137 --> 47:20.471
That's so neat.

47:23.041 --> 47:24.109
What's going on?

47:40.458 --> 47:43.504
It's pretty just phenomenal

47:43.528 --> 47:45.672
to be able to sit in
this shop all day long,

47:45.696 --> 47:50.011
make these little changes
almost immediately,

47:50.035 --> 47:52.179
go back and forth,
go back and forth

47:52.203 --> 47:54.982
without having to ship a
product back to the maker

47:55.006 --> 47:56.250
and then get it a week later,

47:56.274 --> 47:58.143
that kind of a process.

47:59.277 --> 48:00.378
That was quick.

48:11.622 --> 48:12.666
I'm ready to take it off.

48:12.690 --> 48:14.292
Yeah, let's do this.

48:16.094 --> 48:19.173
That's it, destruction,
it did well, that thing,

48:19.197 --> 48:22.500
that thing's done well.

48:26.571 --> 48:27.638
It's pretty cool.

48:29.407 --> 48:31.407
I think I'm gonna have a
hard time beating this up.

48:31.431 --> 48:33.054
It'll be like a new surf board.

48:33.078 --> 48:34.958
Once you get the first
ding the it'll be alright

48:34.982 --> 48:39.287
but until then, polish it off
at the end of every night.

48:41.719 --> 48:43.297
Crank down.

48:43.321 --> 48:44.841
Crank it down so you
can really just...

48:44.865 --> 48:46.467
Do a pull up.

48:46.491 --> 48:49.627
Yeah, and that's kind of when
it's gonna be necessary.

49:03.674 --> 49:06.277
Nice, wow, fantastic.

49:08.079 --> 49:09.079
Good work.

49:10.181 --> 49:12.083
That's a start.

49:13.751 --> 49:16.363
The guy before the injury,

49:16.387 --> 49:18.665
very confident about
where I was in life

49:18.689 --> 49:24.205
to overnight being a guy with
one hand instead of two,

49:24.229 --> 49:25.472
holes in my ribcage,

49:25.496 --> 49:27.741
cancer also on top of that.

49:27.765 --> 49:30.377
A year worth of surgeries
in front of me,

49:30.401 --> 49:34.305
no idea what my long term
capacities were gonna be,

49:36.241 --> 49:39.253
and no idea if I
could even go back

49:39.277 --> 49:43.390
to the career that I'd
worked since I was 15 on.

49:43.414 --> 49:44.458
There you go.

49:44.482 --> 49:47.728
See if you come over here, Sam,

49:47.752 --> 49:52.066
see it's almost like the
snow kept it from freezing

49:52.090 --> 49:53.491
on top of something.

50:00.331 --> 50:01.808
Except for the one thing,

50:01.832 --> 50:03.677
never doubting
that I would live.

50:03.701 --> 50:06.313
The second my eyes opened
on that forest floor

50:06.337 --> 50:07.581
and I had a heartbeat,

50:07.605 --> 50:09.450
I'm gonna get myself out of here

50:09.474 --> 50:13.578
and I'm gonna get myself
back to that, back to life.

50:36.667 --> 50:39.480
How you doing today, Ed?

50:39.504 --> 50:40.747
I'm good.

50:40.771 --> 50:42.183
I'm about to fly
out to New Mexico

50:42.207 --> 50:43.450
for this catering gig

50:43.474 --> 50:45.352
so getting my knives sharpened,

50:45.376 --> 50:49.156
feeling a little time
crunched right now.

50:49.180 --> 50:51.292
I was just looking around

50:51.316 --> 50:53.636
and it's pretty awesome place
to be sharpening your knives,

50:53.660 --> 50:55.429
out in your front yard.

50:55.453 --> 50:56.453
I like it.

51:03.305 --> 51:04.305
So marinade for the?

51:04.329 --> 51:07.341
Yeah, dry, dry rub.

51:07.365 --> 51:11.512
Ranga and I are doing a
little at home testing

51:11.536 --> 51:14.148
for this catering gig.

51:14.172 --> 51:15.849
It's quite a big function.

51:15.873 --> 51:19.377
It's over the course
of a week, 150 people.

51:20.645 --> 51:22.456
Working with guests

51:22.480 --> 51:25.392
and what are people gonna
think about the crazy hand

51:25.416 --> 51:28.395
and I like the way
this one looks.

51:28.419 --> 51:32.290
I feel more confident
with it, that's for sure.

51:47.938 --> 51:51.342
I haven't put one of these
on in almost a year.

51:52.877 --> 51:54.455
That's the longest
time I've ever gone

51:54.479 --> 51:58.316
without putting one of
these on since I was 15.

52:03.221 --> 52:04.289
Firing it up.

52:11.496 --> 52:13.798
Ranga, these hors
d'oeuvres can go.

52:15.377 --> 52:16.377
Guys how far are you

52:16.401 --> 52:18.212
on having a single platter done?

52:18.236 --> 52:20.347
Guess. Two minutes?

52:20.371 --> 52:22.440
- Uh, three.
- Let's go.

52:26.977 --> 52:29.514
Summer squash salad, thank you.

52:31.216 --> 52:32.526
Put that with the vinaigrette,

52:32.550 --> 52:35.629
feel free to splash some
shrimp, send it out.

52:35.653 --> 52:36.797
Thank you.

52:36.821 --> 52:38.532
Hold up, they're calling me.

52:38.556 --> 52:40.925
It's Jen, I'm a little busy.

52:45.496 --> 52:47.398
That's perfect, get it in.

52:53.504 --> 52:54.504
Awesome.

52:56.741 --> 52:57.741
Ah.

53:00.311 --> 53:01.622
Nice work, Jeff.

53:01.646 --> 53:04.315
You're working too hard.

53:08.386 --> 53:10.264
It's August 4th,
it's my birthday,

53:10.288 --> 53:11.432
I turn 31 today.

53:11.456 --> 53:13.600
I didn't die this last fall.

53:13.624 --> 53:17.003
I've been thinking about
that yesterday and today.

53:17.027 --> 53:18.705
I could not be here.

53:18.729 --> 53:20.874
It could've been game
over but it wasn't.

53:20.898 --> 53:24.911
♪ Happy birthday to you

53:24.935 --> 53:28.706
♪ Happy birthday dear Eduardo

53:30.541 --> 53:34.345
♪ Happy birthday to you

53:39.784 --> 53:40.885
Thanks, guys.

53:47.558 --> 53:48.558
Thank you.

53:52.630 --> 53:54.541
Have you had any
surgeries or anything

53:54.565 --> 53:55.642
since we last saw you?

53:55.666 --> 53:56.510
No.

53:56.534 --> 53:57.802
Okay.

54:00.938 --> 54:04.385
I have a check up
every six months.

54:04.409 --> 54:08.622
I don't know if I'm gonna
get good or bad news.

54:08.646 --> 54:12.317
Take a deep breath
in and hold it.

54:14.452 --> 54:16.763
I'm happy to say that
today I'm cancer free,

54:16.787 --> 54:18.665
I'm a survivor

54:18.689 --> 54:23.637
and I don't know what is gonna
happen six months from now

54:23.661 --> 54:25.706
and that's always
on my mind a little

54:25.730 --> 54:29.334
but I'm not gonna let
that take control of me.

54:30.901 --> 54:34.781
Haven't used you since
Costa Rica, have we?

54:34.805 --> 54:36.683
You're gonna be a mess.

54:36.707 --> 54:40.554
University of Utah Burn
Center, Eduardo Garcia,

54:40.578 --> 54:42.823
"Bethany Hamilton
surfboard handle kit."

54:42.847 --> 54:44.558
"The kit and this handle"

54:44.582 --> 54:46.502
"has enabled her to control
her board underwater"

54:46.526 --> 54:49.362
"with only hand
while duck diving."

54:52.557 --> 54:55.669
I'm not gonna think for
the people around me.

54:55.693 --> 54:57.838
I'm not gonna wonder if
they think I look weird

54:57.862 --> 55:01.542
or "Oh my God, that guy's got
a fucking hole in his head."

55:01.566 --> 55:05.069
It's like an experience
like this teaches you

55:06.804 --> 55:09.616
to be incredibly happy
with who you are,

55:09.640 --> 55:12.653
no matter what you're
going through.

55:12.677 --> 55:14.612
And for that, I'm grateful.

55:22.753 --> 55:24.993
I want to jump right into it
and them I'm hurting myself.

55:25.017 --> 55:26.667
I think if I hurt myself,

55:26.691 --> 55:29.627
there'd be a lot of people
pretty angry at me.

55:37.502 --> 55:41.606
Well, hopefully we'll do
it again, that's for sure.

55:49.146 --> 55:52.983
Half experimental, half
"How do I do this safely?"

56:04.595 --> 56:05.972
There's a bull right down here

56:05.996 --> 56:07.865
probably in this pocket.

56:15.840 --> 56:18.909
There's two bulls
sparring over there.

56:22.780 --> 56:23.780
Love that.

57:14.832 --> 57:16.743
Eduardo Garcia was
leading a life

57:16.767 --> 57:18.512
most people only dream of

57:18.536 --> 57:20.013
but when he returned
home to Montana,

57:20.037 --> 57:22.483
his life changed forever.

57:22.507 --> 57:26.152
Please welcome the man
known as the bionic chef,

57:26.176 --> 57:27.478
Eduardo Garcia.

57:31.816 --> 57:34.027
Please welcome chef
Eduardo Garcia.

57:34.051 --> 57:36.987
Our chef Eduardo Garcia, thank
you so much for joining us.

57:40.290 --> 57:42.268
Wow, you're so handsome.

57:42.292 --> 57:43.804
Oh, Katie.

57:43.828 --> 57:47.641
How do you, tell us,
does this allow you to,

57:47.665 --> 57:49.865
obviously it allows you to do
everything you need to do?

57:49.889 --> 57:53.046
I mean I got a walnut
crusher down here.

57:53.070 --> 57:55.816
Did it come like that,
that walnut crusher?

57:55.840 --> 57:57.283
Did that come like that? Custom.

57:57.307 --> 57:58.952
Custom crusher.

57:58.976 --> 58:01.187
And if you have to like
grab an apple or something,

58:01.211 --> 58:02.255
you just go phew?

58:02.279 --> 58:03.690
Whacha!

58:03.714 --> 58:05.258
That's so funny.

58:05.282 --> 58:07.193
So you've traveled a
lot around the world.

58:07.217 --> 58:09.537
What would you say was the most
beautiful place you'd been?

58:09.561 --> 58:10.964
Montana.

58:10.988 --> 58:12.733
Montana, well that's
where you live now?

58:12.757 --> 58:14.859
That's why I live there.

58:25.870 --> 58:26.971
Getting there.

58:28.573 --> 58:29.974
We are getting there.

58:34.612 --> 58:36.814
Hello.

58:42.186 --> 58:43.897
Although Eduardo and I

58:43.921 --> 58:46.199
aren't in a romantic
relationship anymore,

58:46.223 --> 58:50.937
we have one of the strongest
relationships I've known.

58:50.961 --> 58:52.272
Beyond there's Bing.

58:52.296 --> 58:54.899
What are you doing
in there Bing?

58:58.335 --> 58:59.580
I feel right now

58:59.604 --> 59:01.848
that Ed and I are best friends

59:01.872 --> 59:05.118
and that's kind of the way
it should be, I think,

59:05.142 --> 59:08.078
for us both to be
who we want to be.

59:12.650 --> 59:14.928
In the moment sitting
there in the hospital,

59:14.952 --> 59:16.863
I didn't realize
how severe it was

59:16.887 --> 59:18.331
and I obviously didn't realize

59:18.355 --> 59:23.069
how impactful it was
on you or my family

59:23.093 --> 59:26.907
or even myself until now
three and a half years later

59:26.931 --> 59:29.175
and you and I are
trying to get on

59:29.199 --> 59:31.311
with our businesses
and our projects,

59:31.335 --> 59:33.113
trying to get on
with our friendship,

59:33.137 --> 59:34.681
with our relationship,

59:34.705 --> 59:39.185
and realizing how
much personal growth,

59:39.209 --> 59:42.889
how much pain, how
much struggle,

59:42.913 --> 59:45.025
everybody experienced and
how much was put on hold

59:45.049 --> 59:46.960
just so that the focus could be

59:46.984 --> 59:48.361
on Ed getting through recovery,

59:48.385 --> 59:50.030
Ed getting through surgery.

59:50.054 --> 59:51.898
It takes people like years
and years and years

59:51.922 --> 59:54.100
to like get out of
where they are.

59:54.124 --> 59:55.736
Then suddenly you're on TV

59:55.760 --> 59:57.560
just like oh yeah, I
happen to have this hook,

59:57.584 --> 59:58.872
it's no big deal

59:58.896 --> 01:00:01.675
and nobody sees that
coming back home.

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:04.410
Sometimes I'm not in the mood.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.780
I actually don't want
to deal with this.

01:00:06.804 --> 01:00:09.916
I don't want to
have to explain...

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.676
any of it.

01:00:35.432 --> 01:00:38.044
I think I knew the
pain that I felt

01:00:38.068 --> 01:00:39.946
not having a dad

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:41.839
has stuck with me my whole life.

01:00:43.808 --> 01:00:45.919
You know, like I made
peace with my dad

01:00:45.943 --> 01:00:49.690
and I have the opportunity
of a lifetime right now.

01:00:49.714 --> 01:00:51.925
I get to see his mistakes

01:00:51.949 --> 01:00:54.885
and I get to apply
those to my life.

01:01:01.425 --> 01:01:05.305
If you had to say who you were,

01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:08.365
how do you describe
Manuel at 19?

01:01:34.925 --> 01:01:39.029
Where were you in your level
of skill as a fisherman?

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:50.150
Not Mexico,

01:01:50.174 --> 01:01:52.452
round trip ticket anywhere
in the world right now.

01:01:52.476 --> 01:01:53.519
Cancun.

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:55.221
No, besides Cancun.

01:01:55.245 --> 01:01:57.290
Nowhere in Mexico,
where would you go?

01:01:57.314 --> 01:01:58.314
Nowhere.

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:02.820
Right here.

01:02:11.962 --> 01:02:13.898
- Empanadas.

01:02:27.144 --> 01:02:28.154
Do you have any regrets,

01:02:28.178 --> 01:02:30.514
things you would do different?

01:03:11.989 --> 01:03:13.566
How is the person
that you are today

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:17.361
different than the person
that you were before?

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:36.180
We made it.

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:39.349
That was good, dad.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:05.185
It's strange being like
early 30s, no kids,

01:04:05.209 --> 01:04:09.289
to think having a pet

01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:11.657
is the first, it's
like a starter kit,

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.226
it's that first step

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:14.895
to having some type
of responsibility

01:04:14.919 --> 01:04:16.262
or some type of thing

01:04:16.286 --> 01:04:19.632
that depends on you at
least a little bit.

01:04:19.656 --> 01:04:22.268
I think it was the best thing
Jen and I've done in years

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:24.962
was get this cat.

01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:30.276
Run along, Bing.

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:32.245
Yeah.

01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:33.679
Oh, yeah.

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:36.016
Oh, she likes it with you.

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.120
That's 'cause I crushed it,

01:04:37.144 --> 01:04:39.152
I got the oils going.

01:04:39.176 --> 01:04:40.176
Right, Bings?

01:04:41.278 --> 01:04:42.355
Yesterday you were saying

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:45.125
how you feel

01:04:45.149 --> 01:04:48.361
that you can't identify
right now with yourself.

01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:51.121
Well, to be in a relationship

01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:58.338
is the immediate opportunity
to hurt someone else, right?

01:04:58.362 --> 01:05:00.606
Or to make their life amazing.

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.670
- Or to make their life...
- That's the point of it.

01:05:02.694 --> 01:05:03.977
But I'm aware of that.

01:05:04.001 --> 01:05:06.003
You're such a pain, man.

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:10.250
I'm trying to reconvince myself

01:05:10.274 --> 01:05:13.419
that I am capable of being in
a relationship with someone

01:05:13.443 --> 01:05:15.545
without fucking them over.

01:05:17.381 --> 01:05:19.025
You know, if it's somebody

01:05:19.049 --> 01:05:20.426
who's really supportive
of you and awesome,

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:22.195
it might actually
make it a bit easier

01:05:22.219 --> 01:05:23.296
'cause then you know
that you have...

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.400
That's funny, that was you.

01:05:24.424 --> 01:05:25.424
Well, yeah.

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:32.405
Yeah, well, hmmph, true.

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:35.641
My hope is that you and I
continue to be better friends

01:05:35.665 --> 01:05:38.544
than others can really
hope to understand.

01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:40.280
You know how impactful
you've been,

01:05:40.304 --> 01:05:43.316
you know that I can't,

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.451
I cannot pay you back

01:05:45.475 --> 01:05:49.189
nor can I validate what you've
done for me, like ever.

01:05:49.213 --> 01:05:50.614
I know.

01:06:02.392 --> 01:06:06.439
At some point, I realized that
he didn't need me anymore.

01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:08.141
I didn't need to be there

01:06:08.165 --> 01:06:11.244
100% of the time
and the caregiver.

01:06:11.268 --> 01:06:13.013
I chose to put my life on hold

01:06:13.037 --> 01:06:16.249
but I've still been wanting
to do things for me

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:17.583
and one of those things

01:06:17.607 --> 01:06:20.977
has been wanting to
do stand up comedy.

01:06:22.446 --> 01:06:24.124
Honestly, I think
the stand up thing

01:06:24.148 --> 01:06:27.127
came from not being heard.

01:06:27.151 --> 01:06:29.195
I'm very confident that
I'm gonna struggle a lot

01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:30.796
just to speak clearly,

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:33.133
just to not be so nervous

01:06:33.157 --> 01:06:36.726
in a room full of people
that are looking at you.

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:42.808
I'm proud of us for surviving.

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:47.071
I have an undending amount
of gratitude for Jen.

01:06:47.804 --> 01:06:49.449
Do what you need to do,

01:06:49.473 --> 01:06:50.783
be who you want to be

01:06:50.807 --> 01:06:54.454
and tell me how I
can support you.

01:06:54.478 --> 01:06:57.523
My role, I'm a friend, I care.

01:06:57.547 --> 01:07:00.193
We've got two first
timers tonight.

01:07:00.217 --> 01:07:01.518
Jen.

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:09.293
So, I'm on Tinder...

01:07:12.496 --> 01:07:16.400
♪ The favorite parts
are what we'll keep

01:07:18.468 --> 01:07:23.849

01:07:37.521 --> 01:07:38.731
No, I don't think Ed owes me.

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:42.435
I think we did pretty
well together.

01:07:42.459 --> 01:07:44.779
What we've experienced and what
we've been through together

01:07:44.803 --> 01:07:48.408
forms a friendship
which is pretty epic.

01:07:48.432 --> 01:07:51.144
♪ There's no race,
there's only a runner

01:07:51.168 --> 01:07:53.846

♪ We made something, we made

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:31.834
Okay.

01:09:34.738 --> 01:09:36.849
That is one of the
most unique ones

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:38.417
we've ever picked.

01:09:38.442 --> 01:09:39.442
Whoa.

01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:47.693
She knows something's funny.

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:49.562
I wonder if she's picking up on,

01:09:49.586 --> 01:09:51.764
this is all Jen's stuff.

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:52.956
Hey, come here.

01:09:56.426 --> 01:09:59.296
Don't you worry,
Jen is moving out.

01:10:05.502 --> 01:10:08.505
She'll come back to us,
Bing, don't you worry.

01:10:24.754 --> 01:10:25.822
Don't you worry.

01:10:27.657 --> 01:10:30.927
She's moving out but
she is not leaving.

01:10:39.503 --> 01:10:41.743
I told her that you're moving
out but you're not leaving.

01:10:41.767 --> 01:10:42.615
Is he okay?

01:10:42.639 --> 01:10:44.650
Look at Bing.

01:10:44.674 --> 01:10:46.386
Bing was trying to
hide in the mattress

01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:48.521
so she could go with you.

01:10:48.545 --> 01:10:49.989
Of course she was.

01:10:50.013 --> 01:10:51.013
That's okay.

01:12:56.139 --> 01:12:57.139
I know.

01:12:58.742 --> 01:12:59.742
I know.

01:13:53.797 --> 01:13:56.909
I would say that my
greatest struggle every day

01:13:56.933 --> 01:14:01.170
is just being true
to who I want to be.

01:14:03.206 --> 01:14:05.818
My strength has always been

01:14:05.842 --> 01:14:08.087
working within the physical.

01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:12.115
The emotional challenges,
I'm finding way harder.

01:14:17.921 --> 01:14:20.966
A friend of mine recommended
I check out a group

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:22.802
called the Challenged
Athletes Foundation.

01:14:22.826 --> 01:14:23.703
Good to see you, man.

01:14:23.727 --> 01:14:24.727
You too.

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:28.941
At my first CAF event,

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:31.977
a lower arm amputee
stepped right up to me,

01:14:32.001 --> 01:14:34.246
pointed and said, "Hey,
are you running"

01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:36.716
"with your prosthetic on?"

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:40.686
And that was the first
time I can remember

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:44.047
really being in public
with my nude forearm

01:14:45.148 --> 01:14:47.250
without trying to hide it.

01:14:48.652 --> 01:14:50.195
There was no denying it,

01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:53.757
it was like boom,
that's your amputation.

01:14:54.924 --> 01:14:56.301
That was my "ah-ha" moment.

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:58.003
I am an amputee,

01:14:58.027 --> 01:14:59.304
I am missing my left hand.

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:01.607
It is a part of who I am

01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:03.876
and it doesn't define me,

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.678
I'm not Eduardo
Garcia, the amputee,

01:15:05.702 --> 01:15:07.036
I'm just Eduardo.

01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:14.844
Swimmers set...

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:22.161
In my every day life,

01:15:22.185 --> 01:15:24.063
I don't have any other amputees

01:15:24.087 --> 01:15:25.731
that are in my
close friend group

01:15:25.755 --> 01:15:27.332
or in my community
that I know of

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:29.902
that I can bounce my successes,

01:15:29.926 --> 01:15:32.528
my losses, my hard times off of.

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:36.809
We inspire and
motivate each other

01:15:36.833 --> 01:15:38.844
by watching what
we're capable of.

01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:39.868
It's incredible.

01:15:42.972 --> 01:15:45.951
Disabilities like what
happened to Eduardo

01:15:45.975 --> 01:15:47.653
in a way is like
being born again

01:15:47.677 --> 01:15:49.321
'cause your life gets
flipped upside down

01:15:49.345 --> 01:15:50.756
and you start over

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:53.092
whether you want
to admit it or not

01:15:53.116 --> 01:15:55.060
it's flipped upside down.

01:15:55.084 --> 01:15:55.928
Scoot back a little.

01:15:55.952 --> 01:15:56.952
Okay.

01:15:58.922 --> 01:16:02.592
You ultimately, you gotta
find who you are again.

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.070
That was so cool,

01:16:05.094 --> 01:16:07.272
I watched you catch
that first wave in.

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:08.674
That was awesome.

01:16:08.698 --> 01:16:10.066
That was awesome.

01:16:11.735 --> 01:16:12.735
Up and over.

01:16:14.037 --> 01:16:19.018
I've never tried surfing
without my prosthetic on

01:16:19.042 --> 01:16:21.044
so that's gonna be a first.

01:16:22.946 --> 01:16:24.323
I know it's kind of just,

01:16:24.347 --> 01:16:25.958
it's a safe zone to discover

01:16:25.982 --> 01:16:29.328
and really be super
vulnerable and super open

01:16:29.352 --> 01:16:32.121
and grow together.

01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:46.211
I truly feel this urgent need

01:16:46.235 --> 01:16:48.247
to say thanks at large

01:16:48.271 --> 01:16:52.017
like that asshole kid
that was so selfish

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:53.352
and focused on my own stuff,

01:16:53.376 --> 01:16:56.255
I almost feel guilty

01:16:56.279 --> 01:16:59.015
that I got so much given to me.

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:05.330
I wouldn't be here if
it wasn't for others

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:07.166
so my life moving forward

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:11.136
needs to be in some
dedication to others.

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:13.873
I've inflicted a lot
of pain in my life.

01:17:13.897 --> 01:17:17.066
I've been a class A
beep, I have, I have.

01:17:23.106 --> 01:17:25.084
I have been so many
times in my life

01:17:25.108 --> 01:17:27.787
just focused on what I want.

01:17:27.811 --> 01:17:29.822
I think I've always
been a driven person,

01:17:29.846 --> 01:17:31.223
I think I've always
had more energy

01:17:31.247 --> 01:17:33.192
than anyone knew
what to do with.

01:17:33.216 --> 01:17:36.095
You get kicked out of
nine schools, I mean,

01:17:36.119 --> 01:17:40.733
but I think this experience
it did a couple of things.

01:17:40.757 --> 01:17:45.204
It fortified my interest in
making every moment count

01:17:45.228 --> 01:17:46.806
and it also encouraged me

01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:49.308
that this is a life worth living

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:52.144
and it's a life worth living
really, really, really well.

01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:57.116
I mean, I have bad days, for
sure, this sucks, it does,

01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:00.953
but I'm not gonna live in that.

01:18:00.977 --> 01:18:03.188
My choice is I'd rather
wake up and say,

01:18:03.212 --> 01:18:05.725
"Hey, I'm gonna put a
stainless steel plate"

01:18:05.749 --> 01:18:07.960
"on the bottom of that and
now I've got a hammer."

01:18:07.984 --> 01:18:10.830
The curiosity that maybe
got me electrocuted.

01:18:10.854 --> 01:18:13.398
"Oh, what's that?
It's a dead bear,

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:16.435
that's kind of weird looking."

01:18:16.459 --> 01:18:20.172
Maybe that curiosity is
what pushes me through.

01:18:20.196 --> 01:18:21.907
I'm fortunate to
just still be alive

01:18:21.931 --> 01:18:24.076
but it's those mistakes
that you make,

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:25.210
you learn from 'em,

01:18:25.234 --> 01:18:28.347
I'm not touching any more bears.

01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:30.850
But it doesn't mean I'm
not lifting up twigs

01:18:30.874 --> 01:18:32.184
and looking for things

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.486
and seeing where
opportunity lies.

01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:36.188
Here's the thing

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:38.958
is caregivers kind of get
the blind sight, right,

01:18:38.982 --> 01:18:40.793
like I had the People
magazine write up

01:18:40.817 --> 01:18:41.794
and I was on Good
Morning America

01:18:41.818 --> 01:18:43.195
and I got flown to New York

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:46.298
and there's been a lot
of publicity on me

01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:50.102
and absolutely zero on every
single person that helped me

01:18:50.126 --> 01:18:52.004
and without them,

01:18:52.028 --> 01:18:54.807
I wouldn't have made
it through that.

01:18:54.831 --> 01:18:56.831
So I would encourage, if
you're out there right now

01:18:56.855 --> 01:18:58.443
and you're helping
your best friend,

01:18:58.467 --> 01:19:00.880
your little brother or sister,
your mom, your dad, whoever,

01:19:00.904 --> 01:19:03.315
to get through a hard time

01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:05.851
and you feel like all the
attention's on them,

01:19:05.875 --> 01:19:10.155
they can't do it without you
and without your support.

01:19:10.179 --> 01:19:12.415
So I want any number of people

01:19:13.917 --> 01:19:15.494
to join me right here,

01:19:15.518 --> 01:19:17.196
grab my left hand,
grab my right hand,

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:18.340
join it up with that corner,

01:19:18.364 --> 01:19:20.065
join it up with that corner

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:23.168
and I want to see if this
entire room in the next minute

01:19:23.192 --> 01:19:25.161
can connect hands, go.

01:19:33.536 --> 01:19:37.549
Everybody find your pulse.

01:19:37.573 --> 01:19:40.185
That pulse is now going through
every single one of us.

01:19:40.209 --> 01:19:41.344
We are connected.

01:19:44.224 --> 01:19:45.224
Thanks.

01:19:45.248 --> 01:19:47.516
Yeah man, 100%, you too.

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:51.888
You can just like
hold on to it like.

01:19:53.456 --> 01:19:56.201
Just listening to your story
about troubles in school

01:19:56.225 --> 01:19:58.270
is just very inspiring for me

01:19:58.294 --> 01:20:01.240
because everything
that you've said

01:20:01.264 --> 01:20:02.574
I could kind of relate to.

01:20:02.598 --> 01:20:04.343
Thanks for coming out.

01:20:04.367 --> 01:20:08.013
My brother was in the ICU
about the same time as you.

01:20:08.037 --> 01:20:10.082
He got hit with a
firework and was burned,

01:20:10.106 --> 01:20:14.153
he's seven but it's been tough.

01:20:14.177 --> 01:20:15.220
How's he doing?

01:20:15.244 --> 01:20:16.088
He's doing really good.

01:20:16.112 --> 01:20:17.589
Nice.

01:20:17.613 --> 01:20:19.524
Sounds like you've been
there for him though?

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:20.548
Yeah.

01:20:22.085 --> 01:20:25.288
That's awesome, man.
That's the stuff.

01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:37.934
I left this parking lot four
years ago today at 10:30.

01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:48.477
You look at my experiences
leading into this injury,

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:54.326
maybe I'm doing myself no favors

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:58.363
by just continuing
to push through

01:20:58.387 --> 01:21:01.100
and not stopping to
take a full appraisal

01:21:01.124 --> 01:21:02.902
of why I am the way I am

01:21:02.926 --> 01:21:05.328
and how much it means to change.

01:21:09.999 --> 01:21:13.212
Everyone that has encouraged
me and supported me

01:21:13.236 --> 01:21:16.515
and forgiven me and
held me accountable

01:21:16.539 --> 01:21:20.309
has brought me to today

01:21:22.578 --> 01:21:25.448
and how I make my
life moving forward.

01:21:29.085 --> 01:21:31.487
You're damn right
I would go back.

01:21:33.073 --> 01:21:34.433
Funny last time I
was here with Jen

01:21:34.457 --> 01:21:36.235
I couldn't even stand here.

01:21:36.259 --> 01:21:38.661
I was so pissed, man.

01:21:39.528 --> 01:21:41.664
I was so pissed.

01:21:51.707 --> 01:21:54.653
It feels like a long time ago.

01:21:54.677 --> 01:21:58.223
It feels like more
than four years ago.

01:21:58.247 --> 01:22:01.326
It feels like a lifetime ago.

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:03.352
