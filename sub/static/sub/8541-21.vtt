WEBVTT

00:05.744 --> 00:07.964
[siren blaring]

00:16.233 --> 00:19.628
Morning, boss. Victim's name
was Walton Parsell.

00:19.715 --> 00:22.065
Owner of the jewelry store
found him here this morning.

00:22.152 --> 00:23.762
Says Walton bought
a woman's necklace from her

00:23.849 --> 00:25.112
around closing time
last night.

00:25.199 --> 00:26.983
- So not a robbery.
- No.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.854
Local cops say there was
a jewelry store burglary

00:28.941 --> 00:30.987
across town last month.
No signs of a break-in.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.815
Check the surveillance footage.

00:32.902 --> 00:34.382
What do we know
about the victim?

00:34.469 --> 00:36.862
He's a prison guard from Carson,
just outside of town.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.864
- You sure?
- Yeah.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.562
- Hmm.
- What?

00:40.649 --> 00:41.954
Oh, okay.
It's in his hands.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.608
[indistinct radio chatter]

00:43.695 --> 00:47.438
Yeah, bit nails, not too
calloused. Blue collar job

00:47.525 --> 00:49.310
high stress, but no heavy
lifting. Prison guard.

00:49.397 --> 00:50.963
Thought I was losing my touch
there for a second.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.748
God forbid.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.402
[whistles]
Clothes tell a different story.

00:54.489 --> 00:56.708
Check out those formal
but, uh, comfortable boots

00:56.795 --> 00:58.536
and the cheap business suit.

00:58.623 --> 01:01.452
Looks, uh, looks a little
like a detective.

01:01.539 --> 01:03.019
- Don't you think?
- He kinda does, doesn't he?

01:03.106 --> 01:04.803
- Yeah.
- Hey, this is not a cheap suit.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.502
Oh, hey, hey, I'm not saying
anything about your suit.

01:07.589 --> 01:09.112
I'm sure it's not.
You're the real deal.

01:09.199 --> 01:13.073
But this man here,
he was, he was aspirational.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.945
He had hopes to be a lot more
than a prison guard.

01:16.032 --> 01:18.556
- Too bad the job killed him.
- The job? How so?

01:18.643 --> 01:22.125
Well, he worked at a prison.
That's where they keep killers.

01:22.212 --> 01:24.736
An ex-inmate,
probably our best bet.

01:24.823 --> 01:26.390
There are
a lot of stab wounds.

01:26.477 --> 01:27.870
That's how they learn
to kill in prison.

01:27.957 --> 01:29.611
'Prison shanks have points,
not blades.'

01:29.698 --> 01:32.570
They use 'em to puncture bowels,
cause sepsis.

01:32.657 --> 01:35.312
Charming.
Well, the question is this.

01:35.399 --> 01:39.403
Why would you use a prison shank
outside of prison?

01:41.013 --> 01:43.015
I'll run a check
of all the ex-inmates

01:43.103 --> 01:44.452
from Carson in the area.

01:50.501 --> 01:52.938
- It's a wedding invitation.
- Is there a dinner?

01:53.025 --> 01:54.505
- Salmon or prime rib.
- I'm in.

01:56.855 --> 01:58.901
- Who am I sitting with?
- You're next to Cho.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.862
Where are we
with Walton Parsell?

02:03.949 --> 02:05.516
Grew up outside of Hangtree.
Parents are dead.

02:05.603 --> 02:06.996
No close relations nearby.

02:07.083 --> 02:09.303
Started up at Carson
on his 21st birthday.

02:09.390 --> 02:11.914
I used his call history
to track down a girlfriend.

02:12.001 --> 02:13.524
Shelley Dillion.
She's a hairdresser in town.

02:13.611 --> 02:15.309
I'll take Jane
and go talk to her.

02:15.396 --> 02:18.181
Cho, you go to the prison.
Where are we with Jane's hunch

02:18.268 --> 02:19.748
'that there's
an ex-con involved?'

02:19.835 --> 02:21.663
The prison sent over
the list you asked for.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.143
Ex-Carson inmates
with violent records

02:23.230 --> 02:24.796
still living in the county.

02:24.883 --> 02:26.929
If Jane's right, one of
these guys is responsible.

02:27.016 --> 02:28.844
It's probably shoe-leather, but
somebody should check it out.

02:28.931 --> 02:30.628
Take a look at that?
I'm on it.

02:30.715 --> 02:32.543
- Alright.
- Want a partner?

02:34.937 --> 02:36.156
Guess not.

02:39.898 --> 02:41.944
[engine turns off]

02:43.119 --> 02:46.035
[instrumental music]

02:48.777 --> 02:49.908
[sighs]

02:53.260 --> 02:54.652
[knocks on door]

02:57.307 --> 02:59.004
[lock clicks]

03:02.138 --> 03:03.792
I need to talk to you
about a murder investigation

03:03.879 --> 03:05.707
I'm working on.

03:05.794 --> 03:09.101
Keep walking, pig.
I got nothin' for you.

03:12.627 --> 03:14.977
Hello, dad.
Good to see you, too.

03:16.848 --> 03:19.373
[theme music]

03:27.207 --> 03:28.425
[door closes]

03:30.949 --> 03:33.300
[intense music]

03:39.567 --> 03:41.525
You're still here, huh?

03:41.612 --> 03:43.788
- You want a beer?
- No.

03:43.875 --> 03:44.963
'Course not.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.881
Surprised you even
know where to find me.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.231
Oh, I make it
my business to know

03:51.318 --> 03:53.015
exactly where you are
at all times.

03:53.102 --> 03:56.323
Really? Keepin' tabs
on me, huh?

03:56.410 --> 03:57.759
Ain't that sweet?

03:57.846 --> 04:00.196
So you still in Sacramento?

04:00.283 --> 04:01.589
I just need to ask you
a few questions.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.809
Procedure.

04:04.896 --> 04:07.812
I'm talking to everyone on
this list of ex-Carson inmates.

04:07.899 --> 04:11.163
[chuckles]
Cops.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.688
That guard's
been dead less than a day

04:13.775 --> 04:15.864
and you're already
grasping at straws.

04:15.951 --> 04:19.433
- So you know about the case.
- Know about it?

04:19.520 --> 04:21.739
Hell, boy, walking
around town ten minutes

04:21.826 --> 04:24.002
I could tell you
who the killer is.

04:24.089 --> 04:26.701
But not cops.
They got procedures.

04:28.572 --> 04:31.271
Look, I, I have
to know if you were--

04:31.358 --> 04:34.752
I get it.
No, sir, officer.

04:34.839 --> 04:36.885
I did not
kill anyone last night.

04:36.972 --> 04:38.365
Then tell me where you were.

04:38.452 --> 04:40.976
Cat and the fiddle
on Delaware.

04:41.977 --> 04:44.153
They all remember me.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.766
You working?

04:48.853 --> 04:50.768
I get by.

04:50.855 --> 04:53.162
Smuggling cigarettes?
Dealing meth again?

04:54.903 --> 04:59.995
My own flesh and blood,
a lousy cop.

05:00.082 --> 05:01.692
Makes me wanna puke.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.607
I just don't wanna see you
back in jail. That's all.

05:03.694 --> 05:07.176
You always were a self-righteous
little bastard.

05:07.263 --> 05:10.571
'That comes from your
mom's side of the family.'

05:10.658 --> 05:13.530
No matter how many times
I straightened you out

05:13.617 --> 05:16.054
I never could fix you
of that.

05:16.141 --> 05:18.100
It's in the blood, I guess.

05:18.187 --> 05:21.321
If you have nothing more
to say about Walton Parsell

05:21.408 --> 05:22.757
thanks for your time.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.935
[door opens]

05:27.022 --> 05:28.632
[door slams]

05:28.719 --> 05:32.680
I guess I'm in shock.
I feel like I'm numb, you know?

05:32.767 --> 05:34.246
How long
had you known Walton?

05:34.334 --> 05:37.685
Two months.
That's pretty long for me.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.339
And when was the last time
you saw him?

05:39.426 --> 05:42.298
Two nights ago.
We had dinner out.

05:42.385 --> 05:46.041
Quick Chinese,
nothing special.

05:46.128 --> 05:48.565
He was supposed to call me
last night.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.393
But he didn't.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.961
I thought he was done
with me.

05:53.048 --> 05:55.311
You know,
like that was it.

05:55.398 --> 05:59.097
Walton had bought a gold
necklace just before he died

05:59.184 --> 06:00.708
and you were worried
that he was gonna leave you?

06:00.795 --> 06:02.797
Because he was a good person?

06:02.884 --> 06:04.886
He wasn't your usual type,
was he?

06:04.973 --> 06:06.801
Yeah, tell me about it.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.933
I don't know if I'll meet
another guy like Walton.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.413
Yes.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.023
Your taste for bad boys

06:12.110 --> 06:15.113
is a sad relic of your
childhood mistreatment.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.854
No need to pick it
back up again.

06:16.941 --> 06:19.291
Oh, gee, thanks for
the advice, Doctor Phil.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.945
Just because you've heard it
before doesn't mean

06:21.032 --> 06:22.947
it's not good advice.

06:23.034 --> 06:25.994
- Tell us about Walton.
- Walton had a plan.

06:26.081 --> 06:27.735
He wasn't floating.

06:27.822 --> 06:31.826
He was taking night classes
at the community college.

06:31.913 --> 06:35.046
- Criminology.
- Wanted to be a detective.

06:35.133 --> 06:38.833
Can you think of anybody who may
have wanted to hurt Walton?

06:38.920 --> 06:41.009
No.

06:41.096 --> 06:43.751
No, nobody.

06:43.838 --> 06:46.101
Okay. Well, if you think
of anything else

06:46.188 --> 06:47.102
just give us a call.

06:47.189 --> 06:49.626
I will.

06:49.713 --> 06:52.063
Oh, uh, Shelley,
there is one more thing.

06:52.150 --> 06:55.937
Have you ever stolen supplies
from work here?

06:56.024 --> 06:57.242
[whispers]
No.

06:57.329 --> 06:59.462
[normal voice]
No. Of course not.

06:59.549 --> 07:00.594
Good girl.

07:06.948 --> 07:09.429
Walton meant well.
That's for sure.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.343
But?

07:11.431 --> 07:15.043
[scoffs]
Well, he had these
dreams of being a detective.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.524
He just didn't get
that's not what we do here.

07:17.611 --> 07:20.352
We're not detectives.
We're zookeepers.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.833
He was overzealous.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.749
Look, I don't want my men
looking for trouble.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.708
I want them to finish
their shifts

07:27.795 --> 07:30.058
with nobody getting hurt,
including themselves.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.538
Did you know Walton
was studying criminology

07:31.625 --> 07:33.017
at the local college?

07:33.104 --> 07:35.585
Yeah. That was a big part
of the problem.

07:35.672 --> 07:38.109
That school
was just spurring him on.

07:38.196 --> 07:40.721
Just last month, he told me
he was already building a case

07:40.808 --> 07:42.331
to transfer
one of the inmates

07:42.418 --> 07:44.594
to one of those
supermax facilities

07:44.681 --> 07:46.770
getting help from one
of his professors.

07:46.857 --> 07:49.338
- Which inmate?
- Well, Walton wouldn't tell us.

07:49.425 --> 07:50.774
It's confidential, he says.

07:52.384 --> 07:53.864
He wanted to present
his case to us

07:53.951 --> 07:56.040
and, uh, warden
at the next staff meeting.

07:56.127 --> 07:57.912
Did the inmates know
what Walton was doing?

07:57.999 --> 08:01.045
The inmates know everything,
more than me.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.656
That's something else
Walton didn't understand.

08:03.918 --> 08:06.486
[door buzzer]

08:10.925 --> 08:13.580
And studies constantly show
that eyewitness identification

08:13.667 --> 08:15.886
is wrong
as often as it is right

08:15.973 --> 08:18.933
'because the human brain
is not a computer.'

08:19.020 --> 08:21.979
Can anyone tell me
what day of the week

08:22.066 --> 08:25.983
May 31st, 1976 fell on?

08:26.070 --> 08:28.333
- Tell me quickly. You see--
- Monday.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.727
Pardon me?

08:30.814 --> 08:34.209
Monday. It was a Monday.
My brain is a computer.

08:34.296 --> 08:36.777
It's a steel trap.
A computerized steel trap...

08:36.864 --> 08:39.257
Professor Huff, hi.
I'm Agent Lisbon.

08:39.344 --> 08:40.998
This is Patrick Jane.
We're with the CBI.

08:41.085 --> 08:43.348
We're investigating the murder
of Walton Parsell.

08:43.435 --> 08:45.350
Oh, I was very sorry
to hear about it.

08:45.437 --> 08:46.874
How can we help you?

08:46.961 --> 08:48.440
Uh, we know that
he was looking to transfer

08:48.528 --> 08:50.747
an inmate at the prison,
and, uh--

08:50.834 --> 08:54.055
Yes. The inmate was involved
in extortion and racketeering

08:54.142 --> 08:56.013
and we analyzed
the legal framework

08:56.100 --> 08:57.493
required to take action.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.234
Did he give you
the inmate's name?

08:59.321 --> 09:02.411
Well, we deliberately don't use
real names in our conversations.

09:02.498 --> 09:05.457
I'm sure he probably mentioned
it but I don't recall.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.198
I'll take over from here,
if you don't mind.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.200
- Oh.
- Hello, class.

09:09.287 --> 09:12.726
Memory is unreliable
because the untrained brain

09:12.813 --> 09:14.684
has a crappy
filing system.

09:14.771 --> 09:16.773
It takes everything that happens
to you and throws it all

09:16.860 --> 09:18.296
willy-nilly
into a big, dark closet.

09:18.383 --> 09:19.950
When you go in there
looking for something

09:20.037 --> 09:21.735
all you can find
are the big, obvious things

09:21.822 --> 09:23.084
'like when your mind died'

09:23.171 --> 09:24.651
'or stuff that
you don't really need'

09:24.738 --> 09:25.913
stuff that
you're not looking for

09:26.000 --> 09:28.480
like, uh, like the words
to "Copacabana."

09:28.568 --> 09:31.832
You can't find what you need,
but don't panic

09:31.919 --> 09:35.749
because it is still there.
Now if we may

09:35.836 --> 09:38.490
my lovely assistant and I
will help you rummage

09:38.578 --> 09:41.493
'through your magic closets.'

09:41.581 --> 09:46.281
Somewhere in there lurks a name,
so start digging

09:46.368 --> 09:48.892
and sorting
and pulling things out

09:48.979 --> 09:51.591
'and weeding through.
It may be connected to, uh'

09:51.678 --> 09:54.158
'the way that Walton laughed'

09:54.245 --> 09:57.727
or the smell of his breath.
You just thought of something.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.860
The inmate must
have tattoos.

09:59.947 --> 10:01.992
Walton said the guy
beat up a tattooist

10:02.079 --> 10:03.690
for spelling "Aryan" wrong.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.822
There we go. Excellent.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.171
Walton asked me questions

10:07.258 --> 10:09.391
about crime
in my hometown, Fontana.

10:09.478 --> 10:12.176
Very good.
We're getting somewhere here.

10:12.263 --> 10:14.614
Just let your mind go
wherever it wants.

10:14.701 --> 10:17.051
He may have lent you a pen.
He may have worn an ugly shirt.

10:17.138 --> 10:19.967
Mm-mm, no, no, he was
always very buttoned up

10:20.054 --> 10:22.709
and very neat
like a soldier. Um..

10:22.796 --> 10:26.756
...like a-a Roman soldier.
A general. Caesar.

10:26.843 --> 10:30.325
Julius. I know,
wait. Brutus, Marcus.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.066
- The inmate's name was Marcus.
- 'Marcus.'

10:32.153 --> 10:34.155
So we're looking for an inmate
with white gang tattoos

10:34.242 --> 10:36.592
who's from Fontana whose name
is Marcus. That'll help.

10:36.679 --> 10:40.944
Excellent work. "A" plus.
Class dismissed. No homework.

10:41.031 --> 10:42.511
[indistinct chattering]

10:42.598 --> 10:46.558
Oh! Her name was Lola.
She was a showgirl.

10:48.169 --> 10:49.736
[door closes]

10:49.823 --> 10:51.738
Marcus Lansdale.

10:51.825 --> 10:54.305
He was a member of the white
trash lowriders from Fontana

10:54.392 --> 10:55.872
when he shot
a highway patrolman

10:55.959 --> 10:57.439
during a routine traffic stop
ten years ago.

10:57.526 --> 10:58.788
'Patrolman's in a wheelchair.'

10:58.875 --> 11:00.442
Looks like Walton
picked a winner.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.705
They suspect him of running
the prison's protection racket--

11:02.792 --> 11:05.055
protects the drug dealers
from the gangs

11:05.142 --> 11:06.970
takes care of snitches,
but they can't prove any of it.

11:07.057 --> 11:08.450
If Walton
was asking questions

11:08.537 --> 11:10.017
Lansdale probably
heard about it.

11:10.104 --> 11:11.583
Jane and I will go talk to him.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.107
If he's involved,
that means

11:13.194 --> 11:15.892
there's a hit man
on the outside. Hey, Rigsby.

11:15.979 --> 11:18.112
Jane's hunch about
the ex-Carson inmate pay off?

11:18.199 --> 11:20.505
I checked out everyone
on the list. Nothing hinky.

11:20.592 --> 11:23.073
Alright, we need to check into
Lansdale's known associates.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.728
Uh, boss, can I, uh,
talk to you for a minute?

11:25.815 --> 11:27.904
- Sure.
- In your office.

11:27.991 --> 11:29.210
Alright.

11:30.298 --> 11:32.692
[instrumental music]

11:36.739 --> 11:39.220
I've never talked to you
about my father.

11:39.307 --> 11:40.525
Sit down.

11:43.050 --> 11:46.531
I know about your dad.
I'm your boss.

11:46.618 --> 11:49.926
Steven Robert Rigsby, convicted
of manslaughter, assault.

11:50.013 --> 11:52.886
'Drug dealing.'

11:52.973 --> 11:55.976
Your father was on that list,
wasn't he?

11:56.063 --> 11:58.456
I checked out his alibi.
No special treatment.

11:58.543 --> 11:59.675
If you wanna send
someone else--

11:59.762 --> 12:01.895
[Teresa]
'I trust you, Rigsby.'

12:01.982 --> 12:03.810
However, if you ever come
into contact

12:03.897 --> 12:05.986
with your father,
on a case, next time

12:06.073 --> 12:07.727
you bring
somebody with you.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.511
Yeah, okay.

12:09.598 --> 12:12.949
You need to get a list
of Lansdale's known associates.

12:13.036 --> 12:15.343
- Get it done by morning.
- You got it, boss.

12:17.388 --> 12:20.087
[instrumental music]

12:26.528 --> 12:28.704
We're here to talk to you
about Walton Parsell.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.445
- We've read your files--
- I haven't.

12:30.532 --> 12:33.622
- I'm, I'm getting to it.
- I'veread your file.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.624
I know that you're running
the protection racket

12:35.711 --> 12:37.582
here at Carson and that Walton
was planning on moving you

12:37.669 --> 12:39.584
to a higher security prison.

12:39.671 --> 12:42.892
California law
used to say that a man

12:42.979 --> 12:46.809
sentenced to life in prison
is legally dead.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.464
That's a fact.
Legally dead.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.467
And..

12:52.554 --> 12:55.470
I've been a dead man
for ten years.

12:55.557 --> 12:58.125
The outside world's
got no hold on me.

12:58.212 --> 13:02.346
You think some screw poking
into my business bothers me?

13:02.433 --> 13:05.436
Aw, you're not so tough.
There's always bigger fish.

13:05.523 --> 13:06.873
Not in my pond.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.526
Well, Walton wanted
you transferred.

13:08.613 --> 13:11.878
You might have ended up
in a pond with a giant pike

13:11.965 --> 13:14.576
or snapping turtles. Ugh.

13:14.663 --> 13:17.492
I have defended myself
very successfully

13:17.579 --> 13:21.670
against charges
that I am a security risk.

13:21.757 --> 13:24.194
So whatever Parsell
wanted to throw at me

13:24.281 --> 13:25.500
would've gone the same way.

13:25.587 --> 13:28.677
Did you know what Walton
was gonna do?

13:28.764 --> 13:30.026
[sighs]

13:30.113 --> 13:32.072
'Not until you told me.'

13:32.159 --> 13:34.639
[Teresa]
'Maybe one of your friends
on the outside told you.'

13:34.726 --> 13:36.250
Oh, I can take care
of myself.

13:36.337 --> 13:38.643
That's how you ought to know
I didn't kill him.

13:38.730 --> 13:41.342
How so?

13:41.429 --> 13:44.127
Because if I want
a guard dead

13:44.214 --> 13:46.477
you will find him
in a broom closet

13:46.564 --> 13:49.741
right here in Carson
in my cellblock.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.700
Uh, I think he's made
some good points.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.267
Marcus, it's been fun.

13:53.354 --> 13:54.964
I got places to go
and people to meet.

13:55.051 --> 13:55.965
Oh.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.055
Personally, I think
you got the cheekbones

13:59.142 --> 14:00.883
that you can support something
really short.

14:00.970 --> 14:03.016
I mean, it'd look great on you.
You got a great skull.

14:03.103 --> 14:04.844
- I've always said that.
- I really wish you'd stop.

14:04.931 --> 14:07.020
Oh, we brought a photo
as a reference.

14:07.107 --> 14:08.325
- What?
- There.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.549
Why didn't you tell us
you had a brother in prison?

14:22.905 --> 14:24.472
I don't tell anyone
about Marcus.

14:24.559 --> 14:26.169
How'd you know?

14:26.256 --> 14:28.824
Well, you share some
of the same recessive genes

14:28.911 --> 14:32.349
'same earlobes, and you both
have the same tell..'

14:32.436 --> 14:34.830
...before you lie.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.659
You were dating a guy who's
trying to transfer your brother.

14:37.746 --> 14:39.313
He ends up dead.
It doesn't look good.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.532
Wait, wait, wait.
You think Ikilled him?

14:41.619 --> 14:44.144
- That's, that's crazy.
- Not really.

14:44.231 --> 14:46.189
Convince us.
Where were you last night?

14:46.276 --> 14:49.801
Annie from the salon's
bachelorette party.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.022
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
I never would have hurt him.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.719
But you lied to him.

14:54.806 --> 14:55.895
[sighs]

14:58.680 --> 15:02.466
Marcus knew Walton was trying
to get him transferred

15:02.553 --> 15:05.078
so he asked me
to get to know him

15:05.165 --> 15:06.862
'and see what
his weaknesses are.'

15:06.949 --> 15:09.604
One day I followed Walton
from Carson.

15:09.691 --> 15:12.259
He went to a coffee shop.
I went in after.

15:12.346 --> 15:14.261
We got to talking.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.567
We had our first date
a few days later.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.395
You thought Walton
was a sucker.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.876
He could help your brother out,
maybe get a few free meals.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.791
What you first thought
was weakness you realized

15:22.878 --> 15:25.750
was kindness, and then
you got to like the guy.

15:25.837 --> 15:28.362
[Teresa]
'Did Walton find out
about you?'

15:28.449 --> 15:32.192
No, he never found out,
and I wasn't gonna tell him.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.804
When Marcus called me
last week, I told..

15:42.593 --> 15:46.902
You told him you couldn't
do it anymore, and he got mad.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.208
'Did he threaten you?'

15:50.079 --> 15:51.602
You don't know
what he can do.

15:51.689 --> 15:54.040
I think we do.
Walton's dead.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.737
Your brother couldn't
have done it from prison.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.521
That means Walton's killer
is on the loose.

15:57.608 --> 15:58.870
- Well..
- Well, what?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.394
Well, I'm not so sure.
I mean, this..

16:00.481 --> 16:03.353
Make a statement. Maybe we can
get your brother to talk

16:03.440 --> 16:06.748
find out
who killed Walton.

16:06.835 --> 16:09.229
No.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.448
I'm sorry. That's,
that's my brother.

16:12.841 --> 16:14.016
'I can't.'

16:19.282 --> 16:20.675
I talked to Shelley's
co-workers.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.198
- Her alibi checks out.
- Figures.

16:22.285 --> 16:24.418
She didn't
feel right for it anyway.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.855
Still, she could be
an accomplice. Where's Jane?

16:26.942 --> 16:28.291
Uh, first thing
in the morning

16:28.378 --> 16:29.684
he had Cho take him
back to Carson.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.338
Oh, what for?
Lansdale isn't talking

16:31.425 --> 16:34.602
and the killer's
on the outside. Whatever.

16:34.689 --> 16:36.647
Any breaks on finding
Lansdale's hit man?

16:36.734 --> 16:38.432
I talked to Hangtree PD.

16:38.519 --> 16:40.869
They don't have any ideas about
a murder-for-hire candidate.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.871
Lansdale's known associates
on the outside

16:42.958 --> 16:44.568
are a pretty small list.
His whole gang's still in jail.

16:44.655 --> 16:47.093
I read the file from the jewelry
store burglary last month

16:47.180 --> 16:49.617
and there's nothing there.
We need a new angle.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.925
What is it?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.710
There is one angle
I could try.

16:57.842 --> 16:59.583
[knock on door]

17:06.460 --> 17:09.202
[Steve]
'Well, I thought
you'd be back.'

17:09.289 --> 17:11.465
But I didn't think
you'd bring a gift.

17:11.552 --> 17:12.988
We just need a moment
of your time.

17:15.947 --> 17:17.514
Can I get you
somethin' to drink?

17:17.601 --> 17:20.691
- No.
- I wasn't talking to you.

17:20.778 --> 17:24.739
- No, thank you.
- Mm. You get on that yet?

17:24.826 --> 17:26.393
I warned her you'd be crude.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.786
[chuckles]
Couldn't close the deal, huh?

17:28.873 --> 17:31.702
Look, we need your help finding
the killer of Walton Parsell.

17:31.789 --> 17:34.401
Yeah, you said you could find
the killer in ten minutes.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.881
If I wanted to do that,
but why would I wanna do that?

17:36.968 --> 17:38.448
To show me you can.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.059
Show me you're not just
full of big talk.

17:41.973 --> 17:43.627
Well, the least you
could do is ask nice.

17:43.714 --> 17:45.238
I know you know how
to ask nice.

17:46.717 --> 17:51.200
Please, dad.
I need your help.

17:51.287 --> 17:55.726
Alright. We need to find
a woman by the name of Rocket.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.467
Old flame of mine.

17:57.554 --> 17:59.817
She knows everything
that goes on in Hangtree.

17:59.904 --> 18:02.733
- Rocket? Real name?
- Elaine Hamilton.

18:02.820 --> 18:04.257
Got an address?

18:04.344 --> 18:05.997
Well, I don't know
where she sleeps

18:06.085 --> 18:09.566
but I know where she lives--
this jailbird bar in town.

18:09.653 --> 18:14.267
- Can you take us to her?
- Yeah. I can do that.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.007
Just give me a second.
I'll get my keys.

18:18.836 --> 18:20.925
[male #1]
'He was trying to, uh,
transfer Lansdale?'

18:21.012 --> 18:24.625
[chuckles]
'See, that's Walton for you.'

18:24.712 --> 18:27.193
'Meant well, but naive.'

18:27.280 --> 18:29.760
[Cho]
'Lansdale sounds like
a good target for transfer.'

18:29.847 --> 18:32.372
Lansdale is the muscle
at Carson.

18:32.459 --> 18:33.677
Nobody's gonna talk
to Walton.

18:33.764 --> 18:34.983
They don't wanna
find themselves

18:35.070 --> 18:36.898
on the bad end
of Lansdale's knife.

18:36.985 --> 18:38.726
He did his own dirty work?

18:38.813 --> 18:42.121
He who holds the knife
gets the respect from the guys.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.253
You wanna stay on top,
you gotta back it up.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.777
Wow. This is great.

18:46.864 --> 18:49.650
Reality TV at its finest.

18:49.737 --> 18:51.434
Everything that happens
in cellblock "C"

18:51.521 --> 18:53.306
is right here
on these monitors.

18:53.393 --> 18:54.872
Lansdale's too hard-core
for a small place.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.744
You didn't think
about transfer yourself?

18:56.831 --> 18:59.442
[chuckles]
We're guards, not supermen.

18:59.529 --> 19:02.141
Having a shark like Lansdale
in the tank

19:02.228 --> 19:04.230
keeps all these guys in line.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.623
He does your job for you.
That's nice.

19:06.710 --> 19:09.060
So you disapproved of Walton
going after Lansdale.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.716
I didn't have any knowledge
of that Walton's agenda.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.631
That would be supposition.

19:14.718 --> 19:17.417
[door slides open]
Okay.

19:17.504 --> 19:21.986
Oh, you see these two? They're
about to punch each other.

19:22.073 --> 19:24.598
'Look at the way their shoulders
are set. It's very primal.'

19:24.685 --> 19:27.035
So are we done here?
I got work to do.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.645
Jane, you have anything else?

19:28.732 --> 19:31.300
Oh! There they go.
Look, look, look, look. Fight.

19:31.387 --> 19:34.695
We got a fight
in northwest hallway "B."

19:34.782 --> 19:37.785
Somebody break it up.
Okay, I'm on my way.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.221
Lock the--
lock the hallway down.

19:39.308 --> 19:41.571
[alarm blaring]

19:41.658 --> 19:43.399
Jane, unless you have something,
we need to get out of here.

19:43.486 --> 19:45.532
No, you go. I'll, I'll get
a ride home somehow.

19:45.619 --> 19:48.709
- This is way too good.
- Alright.

19:48.796 --> 19:49.971
Way too good.

19:52.147 --> 19:54.541
[intense music]

[music continues]

[footsteps approaching]

20:36.235 --> 20:39.890
- You gonna be here all day?
- Oh, there you are.

20:39.977 --> 20:42.023
I don't wanna scare you,
but, uh...

20:42.110 --> 20:44.068
[door slides]

20:46.027 --> 20:50.074
I did some time
myself once.

20:50.161 --> 20:52.512
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

20:52.599 --> 20:55.645
Anyway, uh,
when I was inside,

20:55.732 --> 20:57.430
there were prisoners
with privileges.

20:57.517 --> 20:58.605
What do you
call those, trustees?

20:58.692 --> 21:00.259
- Yeah.
- You have some here?

21:00.346 --> 21:03.827
- Yeah, we have a few.
- I'd like to talk to them.

21:03.914 --> 21:06.874
Okay. Let's go.

21:06.961 --> 21:09.137
Those guys in the blue..

21:09.224 --> 21:11.139
..that's trustees
from cellblock "C."

21:11.226 --> 21:14.664
- That's, that's Walton's block.
- Hmm.

21:14.751 --> 21:17.145
[Patrick]
'The bald man
with the tattoo..'

21:17.232 --> 21:19.278
...he got long left
on his sentence?

21:19.365 --> 21:20.801
- Velasquez.
- Yeah.

21:20.888 --> 21:23.020
Down to his last year.

21:23.107 --> 21:25.109
I'll take him.

21:25.196 --> 21:28.504
Jorge! Over here.

21:28.591 --> 21:31.115
Let's take two.
Keep 'em honest.

21:31.202 --> 21:34.162
Uh, the guy on the other end.
Other side of the table.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.730
Nick Monaco.
Another short-timer.

21:36.817 --> 21:38.340
He's not a murderer,
is he?

21:38.427 --> 21:40.777
No, Nicky's
a second-story man.

21:40.864 --> 21:45.347
A thief. Got clean hands.
Him, too.

21:45.434 --> 21:46.870
[Prison guard]
'Nicky! Over here.'

21:48.394 --> 21:51.135
[intense music]

21:56.576 --> 21:58.795
[Steve]
'This is the place alright.'

21:58.882 --> 22:00.231
You wait here.
I'll go get her.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.277
No, we'll get her.

22:02.364 --> 22:03.887
You two go walking in there
looking like

22:03.974 --> 22:06.455
the cop family Robinson,
the joint will clear out

22:06.542 --> 22:08.718
'and you'll never
find Rocket.'

22:08.805 --> 22:11.939
Okay. You're not back in
two minutes, we're coming in.

22:12.026 --> 22:15.682
You got it,
officer. Yes, sir.

22:15.769 --> 22:18.162
Yes, sir.
'Sup, Peckerwoods?

22:21.557 --> 22:23.951
You know that game
that kids play?

22:24.038 --> 22:25.300
"My dad can beat up
your dad"?

22:27.824 --> 22:30.784
No one ever played
that with me.

22:30.871 --> 22:34.091
- He's a character.
- Yep.

22:35.745 --> 22:38.052
Maybe this will bring
you two closer together.

22:38.139 --> 22:39.314
[glass shatters]
Don't hold your breath.

22:39.401 --> 22:40.750
[Steve]
'Hey! Put it down!'

22:40.837 --> 22:43.449
You get her.
I'm going in.

22:43.536 --> 22:44.624
Stop!

22:49.280 --> 22:51.761
- '...so bad now..'
- Lower your weapon now!

22:51.848 --> 22:52.980
Get on outta here, boy.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.808
I'm a cop.
Everybody stay calm.

22:54.895 --> 22:57.637
- He's got a knife.
- Yeah, I can see that.

22:57.724 --> 22:59.160
What the hell's
going on in here?

22:59.247 --> 23:00.901
Seems Andy over here
was a little mad

23:00.988 --> 23:03.599
over the last time
we crossed paths.

23:03.686 --> 23:07.211
Wanted to fistfight,
only I don't do fistfights.

23:07.298 --> 23:11.346
- A waste of time. Right, Andy?
- Let me go. Please?

23:11.433 --> 23:13.304
Just put the knife down!
Let me handle this.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.045
[Steve]
'The hell with that.'

23:15.132 --> 23:17.744
[Wayne]
'Dad, nobody
needs to get cut'

23:17.831 --> 23:21.312
and nobody needs to get shot.
Just put the knife down.

23:22.966 --> 23:25.447
[intense music]

23:28.668 --> 23:31.714
Guess ol' Andy here ain't gonna
be taking any more pokes at me.

23:31.801 --> 23:33.150
That's for sure.

23:33.237 --> 23:34.804
You, get outta here.

23:37.111 --> 23:39.200
Your turn.

23:39.287 --> 23:40.810
Put the gun away,
and we'll call this a wash.

23:43.204 --> 23:44.292
Better.

23:45.685 --> 23:49.819
[intense music]

23:49.906 --> 23:51.125
Let's go.

23:56.173 --> 23:58.393
What are you trying to do,
embarrass me?

23:58.480 --> 24:00.351
Never get between me
and my business again.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.049
I just saved
your life in there.

24:02.136 --> 24:04.007
What, that clown? He wasn't
gonna pull the trigger.

24:04.094 --> 24:06.053
Really?
And how'd you know?

24:06.140 --> 24:09.578
Weakness, son. Weakness.
Lives in the eyes.

24:12.015 --> 24:15.715
Meet Rocket.
She's faster than she looks.

24:15.802 --> 24:18.935
- What the hell, Rigs?
- I told you to play nice.

24:19.022 --> 24:20.197
[Wayne]
'You know something
about a prison guard'

24:20.284 --> 24:21.372
'getting killed in town?'

24:21.460 --> 24:24.332
No. No, sir, I do not.

24:24.419 --> 24:26.595
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.

24:26.682 --> 24:28.902
Tell 'em.Tell 'em!

24:31.861 --> 24:33.384
Butch Carwin.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.256
Came into the bar last night.

24:35.343 --> 24:38.259
Flashed a wad of cash
that would choke a mule.

24:38.346 --> 24:40.435
Said he dropped
some prison guard for the dough.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.350
Where can we find Corwin?

24:42.437 --> 24:47.355
Well, he owns some land out near
the quarry off route 23.

24:47.442 --> 24:49.488
Alright.
Thanks for your assistance.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.057
[door clanks]

24:55.972 --> 24:57.931
You some kind
of VIP or somethin'?

24:58.018 --> 25:01.935
Something. You boys can relax.
I'm an ex-con myself.

25:02.022 --> 25:05.416
Writing wolf tickets,
talking out your neck. I'm hip.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.419
- Whatever you say, pal.
- Okay.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.466
That's an interesting tattoo.
Looks fresh. You just get that?

25:11.553 --> 25:14.556
Yeah. My cousin just landed
in here for drugs.

25:14.643 --> 25:17.167
- Nice.
- He's a real artist.

25:17.254 --> 25:19.126
Well, maybe Nick
could use his services.

25:19.213 --> 25:21.563
Not me.
I'm not into all that ink.

25:21.650 --> 25:24.261
Old school. I get it.

25:24.348 --> 25:26.002
I take care of myself.
So what?

25:26.089 --> 25:28.614
Nothing wrong with that.

25:28.701 --> 25:30.354
What's through there?

25:30.441 --> 25:32.661
It's a loading bay
for the laundry.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.184
Let's go take a look,
shall we?

25:37.187 --> 25:39.059
[indistinct chattering]

25:41.583 --> 25:45.413
Do the laundry for every hotel
and restaurant in Hangtree.

25:45.500 --> 25:48.416
Wow. Must keep
the prisoners very busy.

25:50.331 --> 25:51.985
[Nick]
'Three shifts a day.'

25:52.072 --> 25:55.118
Yeah, all us trustees work as
supervisors here in the laundry.

25:55.205 --> 25:57.468
Must know the movers
and shakers around here, huh?

25:57.556 --> 25:59.166
Guys like Lansdale.

26:00.254 --> 26:03.083
[intense music]

26:04.911 --> 26:06.434
I know to mind
my own business.

26:10.743 --> 26:13.702
You know, you seem like
a smart guy.

26:13.789 --> 26:15.922
- Don't be an idiot.
- Excuse me?

26:16.009 --> 26:17.750
If you know something

26:17.837 --> 26:22.015
maybe about Lansdale and his
reign of terror then tell me.

26:22.102 --> 26:25.671
I can get
your sentence shortened.

26:25.758 --> 26:27.586
Listen here.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.892
I got six months
left in this joint

26:29.979 --> 26:32.025
and then I'm free.

26:32.112 --> 26:35.376
I'd like to spend
those six months unstabbed.

26:35.463 --> 26:40.511
I get it. I've been down.
Snitches get stitches.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.296
Oh, see, that's
a popular misconception.

26:43.689 --> 26:46.909
The stitches
are for live people.

26:46.996 --> 26:48.171
Got it.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.441
[Wayne]
'Is that him?'

26:57.528 --> 26:59.269
[Grace]
'Mask doesn't help,
but yeah, I think so.'

26:59.356 --> 27:00.793
Looks like Butch Carwin's
got himself

27:00.880 --> 27:03.709
a good old-fashioned
meth lab.

27:03.796 --> 27:06.233
'And he's armed.'

27:06.320 --> 27:08.148
That's probable cause.
We can take him in right now.

27:08.235 --> 27:09.410
We should call
for backup.

27:09.497 --> 27:10.890
No need.
This is gonna be easy.

27:10.977 --> 27:12.065
You don't need to prove
anything to anyone.

27:12.152 --> 27:13.632
Huh?

27:13.719 --> 27:14.894
Your father is the last
person in the world

27:14.981 --> 27:16.678
you should be
trying to impress.

27:16.765 --> 27:19.855
You're a good person in spite of
him. You don't owe him anything.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.988
You got me wrong. I don't
give a damn about my dad.

27:22.075 --> 27:24.599
I'm just saying we can take
Carwin down now, no problem.

27:26.470 --> 27:28.734
[intense music]

27:46.403 --> 27:49.102
[music continues]

27:57.153 --> 27:58.415
[coughing]

27:58.502 --> 28:01.027
CBI! Down to the ground,
Carwin! Get down!

28:01.114 --> 28:02.463
- 'On the ground!'
- Who's there? Who's there?

28:02.550 --> 28:04.334
- I can't see anything, man!
- I'll pass.

28:04.421 --> 28:07.163
- Get down on the ground now!
- Okay, okay. Son of a bitch.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.426
Facedown on the ground!
Arms out to the side now.

28:13.735 --> 28:16.782
[handcuffs clicking]

28:16.869 --> 28:18.609
Pretty good trick.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.221
Yep. Always worked
on my dad.

28:27.706 --> 28:28.794
We've got you
for production

28:28.881 --> 28:30.360
of methamphetamine
and illegal weapons.

28:30.447 --> 28:31.971
Who knows what else
we're gonna find?

28:32.058 --> 28:34.408
I'm just no damn good.
That's the truth.

28:36.758 --> 28:38.020
You recognize this man?

28:41.850 --> 28:43.243
I might have done
a piece of time

28:43.330 --> 28:48.335
with a fella
like that once. Lansdale.

28:48.422 --> 28:49.945
What about this man?

28:50.032 --> 28:52.948
Oh, him I don't know.
Looks like a cop.

28:53.035 --> 28:56.560
He's the man you killed
for Marcus Lansdale.

28:56.647 --> 28:58.388
Okay, hold up.
I did what now?

28:58.475 --> 29:01.043
Murder for hire.
It's a capital crime.

29:01.130 --> 29:03.437
You finger Lansdale, you'll just
go to jail for a long time.

29:03.524 --> 29:05.482
Okay, look, I don't know
who's telling you what

29:05.569 --> 29:07.571
but I've never seen
that fella in my life.

29:07.658 --> 29:10.487
Why don't you tell me
where you were two nights ago?

29:10.574 --> 29:12.141
Oh, I was cooking up meth.

29:12.228 --> 29:14.578
[cellphone ringing]

29:14.665 --> 29:17.451
Hang tight, Butch.
It's gonna be a long day.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.845
[ringing continues]

29:19.932 --> 29:21.716
Hello?

29:21.803 --> 29:24.458
Lisbon, it's Jane.
I'm in jail. Come join me.

29:24.545 --> 29:26.112
You're still in Carson? Why?

29:26.199 --> 29:28.854
Uh, I'm catching
the killer, of course.

29:28.941 --> 29:31.726
Look, we've got a pretty good
suspect in holding here.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.423
You would know that
if you answered your phone.

29:33.510 --> 29:36.035
These places aren't exactly
built for their reception.

29:36.122 --> 29:38.820
Anyway, trust me, Lisbon.

29:38.907 --> 29:42.171
[Patrick on phone]
'Get your car keys.
Get in your car.'

29:42.258 --> 29:44.347
And..

29:44.434 --> 29:46.262
Lisbon? Yeah.

29:46.349 --> 29:47.437
[clears throat]

29:47.524 --> 29:49.091
[Teresa]
'What's this about?'

29:49.178 --> 29:53.356
Uh, the gentleman with
the shaking leg right there.

29:53.443 --> 29:56.011
Tomas. Come on.

29:58.057 --> 29:59.928
[indistinct chattering]

30:01.538 --> 30:02.757
[Patrick whistles]

30:04.846 --> 30:07.893
Aw, man.

30:07.980 --> 30:09.503
Looks like heroin.

30:09.590 --> 30:12.549
Uh, and I think if you check
the water fountain

30:12.636 --> 30:15.552
you might find, uh...

30:15.639 --> 30:18.077
huh?

30:18.164 --> 30:19.208
Bingo.

30:19.295 --> 30:20.601
It's not mine, man.

30:20.688 --> 30:24.518
I'm sure it's not.
Let's go. Let's go.

30:24.605 --> 30:27.347
Don't be so sure.
Let's go. Let's go.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.874
You had me drive
all the way out here

30:32.961 --> 30:34.049
to watch you bust
a drug dealer?

30:34.136 --> 30:36.051
It wasn't a bust.

30:36.138 --> 30:38.097
I just had to check to see
if my informant's info was good.

30:38.184 --> 30:39.925
Informant?

30:40.012 --> 30:42.362
Yeah, I got one of the prisoners
talking. Gonna give us Lansdale.

30:42.449 --> 30:44.103
Which prisoner
did you get talking?

30:44.190 --> 30:46.235
Nick, the thief.

30:46.322 --> 30:48.977
Yeah. I did
the ol' razzle-dazzle on him.

30:49.064 --> 30:50.587
It was very cop.

30:50.674 --> 30:52.938
He's ready to make
a statement as soon as we can

30:53.025 --> 30:54.722
draw up the paperwork
to get him outta here.

30:54.809 --> 30:56.680
Nobody likes a snitch.

30:56.767 --> 30:57.986
Let's get him outta here.

30:59.248 --> 31:02.121
[indistinct chattering]

31:08.344 --> 31:10.956
[groans]
Take it.

31:11.043 --> 31:15.047
The drug bust in the cafeteria,
I know who talked.

31:15.134 --> 31:18.528
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- Nick, the thief.

31:18.615 --> 31:19.965
Nick?

31:20.052 --> 31:21.314
[sighs]

31:21.401 --> 31:23.403
Cop said
he's giving you up next.

31:23.490 --> 31:26.145
No, he's not.
You get me a knife.

31:26.232 --> 31:30.323
Just before lights out.
You be ready.

31:30.410 --> 31:32.020
Lab techs just finished
going through the stuff

31:32.107 --> 31:33.152
we seized from Carwin.

31:33.239 --> 31:34.805
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.764
It's turning out
to be a pretty nice case.

31:36.851 --> 31:39.288
Meth lab but a garage full
of stolen stereos

31:39.375 --> 31:41.769
and about 600 cartons
of untaxed cigarettes.

31:41.856 --> 31:43.249
Looks like your dad
came through for once.

31:43.336 --> 31:44.641
Wait. What?

31:44.728 --> 31:46.121
I said it looks like
your dad--

31:46.208 --> 31:48.515
- Untaxed cigarettes?
- Yeah? So?

31:48.602 --> 31:49.908
Cover for me.
I gotta go.

31:52.867 --> 31:56.958
[indistinct chattering]

31:57.045 --> 31:58.481
Kind of busy here, boy.

31:58.568 --> 32:00.353
Your lead was crap.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.094
Butch Carwin
didn't kill that guard

32:02.181 --> 32:04.531
but he is smuggling
cigarettes, like you.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.228
That's a weird
coincidence, huh?

32:06.315 --> 32:07.534
I think
I'll freshen this up.

32:07.621 --> 32:10.885
[Wayne]
'Yeah, you should.'

32:10.972 --> 32:13.148
She lied for you to help
take out a rival.

32:13.235 --> 32:14.933
Only thing a cop's
ever good for--

32:15.020 --> 32:17.283
getting rid
of the competition.

32:17.370 --> 32:19.241
Besides, you got yourself
a nice, big bust

32:19.328 --> 32:22.592
for you and the redhead.
Everybody's happy.

32:22.679 --> 32:25.117
[scoffs]
You used me.

32:25.204 --> 32:28.120
Hey, what's family for?

32:28.207 --> 32:30.774
You know?
I think your mom--

32:30.861 --> 32:34.996
Don't talk about my mom.
Shut up. You shut up!

32:35.083 --> 32:36.955
Well, now..

32:37.042 --> 32:39.435
...thinking that maybe taking
a punch at the old man

32:39.522 --> 32:41.611
will fix you up right?

32:41.698 --> 32:43.874
'Give you some inner peace?'

32:43.962 --> 32:46.747
But before you swing,
you remember what I said before.

32:51.186 --> 32:52.622
I don't do fistfights.

32:55.930 --> 32:57.149
Come ahead, son.

32:59.064 --> 33:01.980
[rock music]

33:06.288 --> 33:08.116
[man over PA]
'Locking up
in 15 minutes, gentlemen.'

33:09.944 --> 33:12.294
[intense music]

33:14.644 --> 33:15.906
[Marcus]
'Kill that snitch.'

33:16.995 --> 33:19.040
'Nick, I'm comin' for you.'

33:20.781 --> 33:22.000
Drop the knife, Lansdale.

33:24.785 --> 33:27.222
Don't make me have to
pepper-spray your ass.

33:27.309 --> 33:29.007
[clatter]

33:29.094 --> 33:30.182
You know the drill.

33:33.707 --> 33:35.056
[grunts]

33:39.147 --> 33:41.715
This enough to send him
to supermax?

33:41.802 --> 33:44.892
I gotta say Walton would have
liked to have seen this.

33:44.979 --> 33:46.415
Don't worry. We'll pack
your bags for you.

33:46.502 --> 33:48.374
Yeah? Well,
you can all go to hell.

33:48.461 --> 33:50.898
And that goes
double for Nick.

33:50.985 --> 33:54.206
It's all over this place that
he was the one snitching on me.

33:54.293 --> 33:55.642
Get him outta here.

33:55.729 --> 33:57.513
[indistinct chattering]
Get him outta here.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.472
I know somebody's
gonna get that rat!

33:59.559 --> 34:01.865
Take him outta here.
Lock the cellblock down.

34:01.952 --> 34:03.998
You better move Nick
to an isolation unit.

34:04.085 --> 34:09.351
We put him in the laundry room
on the night shift. Let's go.

34:09.438 --> 34:10.570
Time's up, Nicky.

34:11.614 --> 34:12.702
Nick?

34:14.661 --> 34:15.792
Where'd Nick go?

34:19.013 --> 34:21.015
- You seen Nick?
- He was just at the desk.

34:21.102 --> 34:22.756
Well, he's not now.

34:22.843 --> 34:24.062
We've got a missing convict.
Put us on lockdown.

34:24.845 --> 34:25.933
[alarm blaring]

34:32.418 --> 34:33.375
[man on PA]
'Lockdown on cell block "C".
Inmate missing.'

34:34.681 --> 34:37.162
[intense music]

34:40.861 --> 34:43.298
[crickets chirping]

34:43.385 --> 34:44.865
Is it a rabbit?

34:44.952 --> 34:46.084
Yeah, it's a rabbit.

34:47.781 --> 34:49.870
Rabbit dancing?

34:49.957 --> 34:51.437
Rabbits don't dance.

34:51.524 --> 34:54.266
Cho, got our laundry truck.

34:54.353 --> 34:55.354
Guys, light it up.

34:55.441 --> 34:57.704
[siren blaring]

35:03.275 --> 35:05.103
[shifts gears]

35:05.190 --> 35:07.975
[engine turns off]

35:08.062 --> 35:10.151
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the vehicle.

35:12.936 --> 35:15.113
[door rattling]

35:16.679 --> 35:18.507
[Patrick]
'Olly, Olly, oxen free!'

35:20.727 --> 35:22.032
Some bitch!

35:25.514 --> 35:28.909
I had to run. You made
everyone think I was a snitch.

35:28.996 --> 35:31.216
Yeah, well,
I'm sorry about that.

35:31.303 --> 35:34.044
My bad, but I just thought
it was the best way

35:34.132 --> 35:36.308
for you to show us how
you sneak in and out of prison.

35:36.395 --> 35:38.875
Just like you did the night
you killed Walton.

35:38.962 --> 35:41.095
I got nothin' to say.

35:41.182 --> 35:44.185
Well, we have ways
of making you talk.

35:44.272 --> 35:46.796
[vehicle approaching]

35:50.235 --> 35:51.540
[car door closes]

35:54.543 --> 35:56.502
What the hell
are you doing here?

35:56.589 --> 35:57.764
Keeping warm.

36:03.204 --> 36:04.510
You burn my whole stash?

36:06.816 --> 36:08.035
Yup.

36:10.037 --> 36:10.994
Hard-core.

36:13.301 --> 36:15.782
I do you. You do me, and that's
the way it should be.

36:17.827 --> 36:19.220
So does that make us even?

36:25.966 --> 36:27.881
[click]

36:27.968 --> 36:29.274
[sighs]

36:29.361 --> 36:31.972
[click]

36:32.059 --> 36:33.495
[intense music]

36:36.281 --> 36:37.282
[sighs]

36:37.934 --> 36:39.066
No.

36:40.589 --> 36:41.721
Alright, son.

36:46.769 --> 36:48.336
Just this once.

36:48.423 --> 36:50.164
I'll give you a fair chance.

36:50.251 --> 36:52.384
[grunting]

36:52.471 --> 36:56.083
[coughing]
Too much damn cop in you, boy.

36:56.170 --> 36:57.127
[groans]

36:57.215 --> 36:59.826
[exhales deeply]

36:59.913 --> 37:02.742
[strained voice]
we're not done yet.

37:02.829 --> 37:06.267
[grunts]

37:06.354 --> 37:08.748
[both panting]

37:16.364 --> 37:19.237
[panting]

37:33.990 --> 37:36.602
[instrumental music]

37:43.652 --> 37:45.132
[grunts]

37:53.923 --> 37:55.403
Should've used the knife.

37:55.490 --> 37:56.665
[chuckles]

38:00.930 --> 38:02.236
See you around, son.

38:03.106 --> 38:05.761
[music continues]

38:08.982 --> 38:11.114
The laundry truck driver
is in the other room

38:11.201 --> 38:13.116
singing like a bird.

38:13.203 --> 38:15.075
Save us some time and talk,
and we'll move you

38:15.162 --> 38:17.295
to the east coast where nobody
knows you're a snitch.

38:17.382 --> 38:20.646
I never snitched.
This guy here made that up.

38:20.733 --> 38:22.474
Oh, well, have fun
explaining that

38:22.561 --> 38:24.040
to the boys
on the cellblock.

38:27.174 --> 38:30.438
[exhales deeply]

38:30.525 --> 38:33.267
What the hell.
I'm cooked, right?

38:37.402 --> 38:40.535
I was supposed to get out
in six months.

38:40.622 --> 38:44.583
I wanted to have something
waiting for me.

38:44.670 --> 38:46.280
So I found
that jewelry store in town.

38:46.367 --> 38:49.892
I promised that driver
a share if he'd sneak me out.

38:49.979 --> 38:52.591
[Patrick]  Yes, his poor taste in jewelry was a very early clue.

38:56.725 --> 38:59.641
So I robbed the place.

38:59.728 --> 39:01.469
It went smooth.

39:01.556 --> 39:03.863
So I figure,
let's do another one.

39:03.950 --> 39:06.169
And that's when you ran
into Walton.

39:06.256 --> 39:07.649
Kid didn't have to be
a hero.

39:09.564 --> 39:11.044
He could've just
left it alone.

39:13.263 --> 39:15.701
Uh, I guess, that's just
how he was, you know?

39:17.355 --> 39:19.269
He had to try and do
the right thing.

39:21.228 --> 39:23.273
[choking]

39:29.932 --> 39:31.673
Thought I got away clean.

39:31.760 --> 39:33.980
Well, I figured someone that was
getting in and out of prison

39:34.067 --> 39:35.851
must have the trust
of the guards

39:35.938 --> 39:38.288
hence a trustee,
and the laundry

39:38.376 --> 39:39.986
well, that's just
the smartest way out.

39:42.031 --> 39:43.598
That could have been
any one of us.

39:43.685 --> 39:45.905
Yes, but you and Jorge
stood out.

39:45.992 --> 39:47.428
That's why I chose you both.

39:47.515 --> 39:50.039
His tattoo was far better work

39:50.126 --> 39:52.520
than the average prison work
you see, and fresh.

39:52.607 --> 39:54.217
Then he mentioned
his cousin, the artist

39:54.304 --> 39:57.003
which leaves you and your
perfectly manicured digits.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.309
There's not a nail salon
in prison, is there?

40:02.704 --> 40:03.879
[scoffs]

40:06.708 --> 40:08.928
- I like to look right.
- Mm.

40:09.015 --> 40:11.496
I'm old school.

40:11.583 --> 40:15.108
I never killed anyone on any
of my jobs. I never had to.

40:16.501 --> 40:18.633
I was too good
to need violence.

40:18.720 --> 40:21.070
But still,
you took a knife with you.

40:21.157 --> 40:22.332
[scoffs]

40:23.508 --> 40:25.988
Someone stands
in front of you

40:26.075 --> 40:28.208
gonna take
away everything

40:28.295 --> 40:30.297
you gotta put him down.

40:30.384 --> 40:33.343
I mean, right or wrong,
you put him down.

40:34.606 --> 40:35.737
You get that.

40:37.043 --> 40:38.131
Don't you?

40:44.267 --> 40:46.182
Hey.

40:46.269 --> 40:49.055
Hey. What happened
to you tonight?

40:49.142 --> 40:51.405
- Something with your dad?
- Yeah.

40:51.492 --> 40:53.146
I was gonna make coffee.

40:53.233 --> 40:55.322
Do you wanna go to the shop
down the street, talk about it?

40:55.409 --> 40:57.890
No, I'm fine.

40:57.977 --> 41:00.153
I'm better
than fine, actually.

41:00.240 --> 41:01.284
Alright.

41:03.461 --> 41:06.855
Wait. There's just
one more thing.

41:06.942 --> 41:09.815
I'm sorry, but I'm not
gonna be at your wedding.

41:09.902 --> 41:11.381
Oh.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.426
[sighs]

41:12.513 --> 41:14.341
That's too bad.

41:14.428 --> 41:17.039
You have something else
planned that day?

41:17.126 --> 41:20.565
No. You see,
the problem is..

41:20.652 --> 41:23.785
...I'm still
in love with you.

41:23.872 --> 41:25.570
- You can't--
- Hold on.

41:25.657 --> 41:27.920
I'm not trying
to win you back.

41:28.007 --> 41:32.925
You're marrying a good man.
That's not gonna change.

41:33.012 --> 41:34.709
But neither am I.

41:34.796 --> 41:36.276
This whole thing
where we pretend

41:36.363 --> 41:40.585
that we're just friends,
it, it doesn't work.

41:40.672 --> 41:42.500
I don't know
if it willwork

41:42.587 --> 41:45.938
but I know one thing. I can't
watch you marry another man.

41:48.854 --> 41:49.811
Alright.

41:51.683 --> 41:54.163
You have a good day..

41:54.250 --> 41:55.513
...and a good life.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.867
[gasps]

42:03.869 --> 42:06.654
[instrumental music]

42:21.669 --> 42:23.541
[sighs deeply]

42:31.287 --> 42:32.375
[sniffles]

42:35.596 --> 42:38.077
[Patrick]
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

42:43.125 --> 42:44.387
