Announcer: PREVIOUSLY
ON DAWSON'S CREEK..
DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:03.500 --> 00:05.792
WERE YOU UNDER THE MISTAKEN
IMPRESSION THAT YOU WERE
ACTUALLY INVITED?

00:05.792 --> 00:07.000
WELL IT SAYS "COME ONE, COME
ALL?"

00:07.000 --> 00:10.458
EXCEPT SPOILED TRUST FUND
CASUALTIES FROM RHODE ISLAND.

00:10.458 --> 00:15.375
YOU CAN EITHER GIVE ME ANOTHER
CHANCE, OR GO BACK TO MR. DRAKE

00:15.375 --> 00:19.125
AND WRITE HIM A VERY LARGE CHECK
AND MAKE THIS MARRIAGE ANOTHER
STATISTIC.

00:19.125 --> 00:21.125
GALE, DO YOU WANT TO TRY HAVING
AN OPEN MARRIAGE?

00:22.500 --> 00:24.458
I LOVE HIM, AND I..

00:24.458 --> 00:25.667
I WANT HIM BACK.

00:25.667 --> 00:27.208
THEN WE'RE GOING TO GET HIM BACK
FOR YOU.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.125
AND DON'T GIVE ME
THAT LOOK.

00:36.125 --> 00:38.500
I KNOW THERE'S BEEN
A LOT OF LATE NIGHT
CREEPING AROUND.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.375
I'M JUST TAKING
STANDARD PRECAUTIONS.

00:40.375 --> 00:42.458
YOU ARE SO IN DENIAL.

00:42.458 --> 00:43.208
EXCUSE ME?

00:43.208 --> 00:44.458
DENIAL. YOU CAN'T
ACCEPT THE FACT

00:44.458 --> 00:48.000
THAT THE LITTLE BOY THAT
YOU BROUGHT IN THE WORLD
IS GROWN UP.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.250
AND HE'S A SEXUAL BEING.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.375
YOU HAVING SEX
WITH JOEY?

00:50.375 --> 00:51.542
NO. I DID NOT SAY THAT.

00:51.542 --> 00:53.667
BUT I AM A SEXUAL BEING.

00:53.667 --> 00:55.166
RESPONSIBLE, MIND YOU.

00:55.166 --> 00:57.375
BUT BIOLOGICALLY,
A SEXUAL BEING.

00:57.375 --> 00:58.500
A SEXUAL BEING?

00:58.500 --> 01:01.375
YEP. YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE
FACING THAT REALITY, DAD.

01:01.375 --> 01:03.417
IT'S A TYPICAL
PARENTAL PROBLEM.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:03.417 --> 01:04.917
NO. WHAT?

01:04.917 --> 01:06.083
THE SOONER YOU ACCEPT IT,

01:06.083 --> 01:07.333
THE SOONER YOU AND I

01:07.333 --> 01:08.917
WILL HAVE AN HONEST
RELATIONSHIP.

01:08.917 --> 01:12.375
MM-HMM. DAWSON,
ARE YOU AND JOEY
HAVING SEX?

01:12.375 --> 01:13.375
NO.
NO?

01:13.375 --> 01:14.375
NO.
THANK YOU.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.542
BUT...ONE DAY...

01:16.542 --> 01:18.208
DOWN THE ROAD...

01:18.208 --> 01:19.875
I'M GONNA HAVE SEX.

01:19.875 --> 01:21.166
AND YOU ACTING
ALL PARANOID

01:21.166 --> 01:22.875
AND CHUCKING LADDERS
AND LOCKING WINDOWS

01:22.875 --> 01:24.750
IS NOT GONNA
STOP ME.

01:24.750 --> 01:28.083
SO PLEASE, WILL YOU STOP
ACTING LIKE A TYPICAL PARENT

01:28.083 --> 01:30.250
AND JUST LET THINGS
TAKE THEIR NATURAL COURSE?

01:30.250 --> 01:32.083
LET JOEY AND ME
HANG OUT IN MY ROOM

01:32.083 --> 01:34.917
ALONE AT NIGHT
UNSUPERVISED.

01:34.917 --> 01:36.125
NO.

01:36.125 --> 01:37.250
WHY NOT?

01:37.250 --> 01:38.625
BECAUSE, DAWSON,
THE FACT IS

01:38.625 --> 01:40.041
I AM A PARENT,
ALL RIGHT?

01:40.041 --> 01:41.250
I AM YOUR PARENT.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.500
AND IT'S MY DUTY
TO BE PARANOID

01:43.500 --> 01:44.458
ABOUT MY 15-YEAR-OLD SON

01:44.458 --> 01:46.917
UPSTAIRS IN MY VERY
OWN HOUSE HAVING SEX.

01:46.917 --> 01:49.208
YOU ARE SO UNENLIGHTENED.

01:49.208 --> 01:50.417
DIDN'T YOU GROW UP
IN THE SIXTIES?

01:50.417 --> 01:52.250
DAWSON,

01:52.250 --> 01:54.458
YOU CAN PSYCHOLOGICALLY
DECONSTRUCT ME
ALL YOU WANT,

01:54.458 --> 01:56.291
BUT HERE'S THE DEAL.

01:56.291 --> 01:58.708
PARENT, ME. CHILD, YOU.

01:58.708 --> 02:00.125
ALL RIGHT?

02:00.125 --> 02:03.834
PARENT, ME. CHILD, YOU.

02:12.250 --> 02:13.750
HE IS SUCH A TYRANT.

02:13.750 --> 02:14.458
YOU HANDLED HIM WELL.

02:14.458 --> 02:15.708
YOU THINK SO?

02:21.375 --> 02:22.750
JOEY?

02:22.750 --> 02:24.250
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:24.250 --> 02:27.959
UH, JOEY, WOULD YOU
COME WITH ME, PLEASE?

02:27.959 --> 02:28.959
WHAT DID I JUST SAY,
DAWSON?

02:28.959 --> 02:30.583
WHAT DID I JUST SAY?

02:30.583 --> 02:32.125
YOU, JANE. ME, TARZAN?

02:32.125 --> 02:34.291
NO, PARENT, ME.
GROUNDED, YOU.

02:35.625 --> 02:36.667
BYE, DAWSON.

02:36.667 --> 02:38.375
BYE, JOEY.

02:38.375 --> 02:39.583
I'LL SEE YOU IN
A FEW MINUTES.

02:39.583 --> 02:41.083
NO, YOU WON'T.

03:32.750 --> 03:34.166
BESSIE, YOU'RE
WATER'S BOILING.

03:34.166 --> 03:35.125
WHAT?

03:36.208 --> 03:38.166
NEVER MIND.

03:38.166 --> 03:39.834
JOEY, I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

03:39.834 --> 03:41.417
I GOT A CALL
FROM THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT.

03:41.417 --> 03:43.166
THEY'RE PLANNING ON
DOING AN INSPECTION

03:43.166 --> 03:44.375
OF THE ICE HOUSE
THIS WEEK.

03:44.375 --> 03:46.208
CAN YOU GO OVER THERE?
NOW?

03:46.208 --> 03:48.708
JUST MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S
PUT AWAY AND SPIC AND SPAN.

03:48.708 --> 03:50.667
LAST THING I NEED NOW
IS THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT

03:50.667 --> 03:52.041
SLAPPING US WITH
SOME BIG FINE

03:52.041 --> 03:53.667
OR GOD FORBID,
CLOSING US DOWN.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.375
YOU SEEM TO BE
FORGETTING SOMETHING.
IT'S CALLED FIRST PERIOD.

03:56.375 --> 03:58.208
OH, COME ON, JOEY, IT'LL
ONLY TAKE A MINUTE.

03:58.208 --> 03:59.875
I GOTTA DROP
ALEXANDER OFF
AT THE SITTER'S.

03:59.875 --> 04:01.291
HE'S MISSING A SHOE.

04:01.291 --> 04:03.166
OH, ALEXANDER, YOU
KICKED OFF YOUR SHOE.

04:03.166 --> 04:04.542
HERE, JOEY,
CAN YOU HOLD HIM?

04:04.542 --> 04:06.000
LOOK, JOEY, PLEASE.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.875
WILL YOU JUST DO ME
THIS ONE FAVOR?

04:07.875 --> 04:10.041
GO BY THE ICE HOUSE
ON YOUR WAY TO SCHOOL.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.291
PLEASE, WILL YOU?

04:11.291 --> 04:13.041
FINE. HERE,
I GOTTA GO THEN.

04:13.041 --> 04:14.583
HANG ON. OK, HERE.
HERE WE ARE.

04:14.583 --> 04:15.959
OK.

04:15.959 --> 04:17.333
OH, WHILE YOU'RE THERE,

04:17.333 --> 04:18.750
WILL YOU JUST WIPE
DOWN THE COUNTERS

04:18.750 --> 04:20.083
REAL QUICK,
SO IT LOOKS CLEAN?

04:20.083 --> 04:22.083
FINE.

04:22.083 --> 04:23.959
OH, YEAH. AND,
JOEY, THE FREEZER.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.792
CAN YOU MOP BEHIND
THE FREEZER?

04:25.792 --> 04:27.917
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME WE DID THAT.

04:27.917 --> 04:30.375
HEY, THANKS, JOEY.
YOU'RE THE GREATEST.

04:32.250 --> 04:34.208
IS THAT THE SEXUAL
BEING HIMSELF?

04:34.208 --> 04:36.083
YOU KNOW WHAT
I WAS THINKING?

04:36.083 --> 04:38.291
NO, BUT I'M SURE
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME.

04:38.291 --> 04:40.458
DON'T TELL ME THAT,
WHEN YOU WERE MY AGE,

04:40.458 --> 04:42.667
YOU WEREN'T SNEAKIN' AROUND
AND MAKIN' OUT WITH GIRLS

04:42.667 --> 04:44.291
IN THE BACKS OF CARS
AND MOVIE THEATERS.

04:44.291 --> 04:46.583
YOU'RE RIGHT. I WAS.

04:46.583 --> 04:49.250
BUT THAT WAS THE WHOLE
FUN OF BEING 15, DAWSON.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.417
IT WAS THE FEAR
OF GETTING CAUGHT

04:51.417 --> 04:53.959
THAT MADE IT
MORE DANGEROUS
AND EXCITING.

04:53.959 --> 04:55.792
SO BY RESTRICTING
MY ACCESS TO JOEY,

04:55.792 --> 04:58.333
WHAT YOU'RE REALLY
TRYING TO DO IS
LIVEN UP MY SEX LIFE?

04:58.333 --> 04:59.625
YOU HEAR THAT, MOM?

04:59.625 --> 05:01.291
WHAT SEX LIFE?

05:01.291 --> 05:03.125
NO. NOW YOU'RE TWISTING
MY WORDS AGAIN, DAWSON.

05:03.125 --> 05:04.125
GO TO SCHOOL.

05:04.125 --> 05:05.583
HEE HEE. DO YOU EVER NOTICE

05:05.583 --> 05:07.792
THAT WHEN YOUR PARENTAL
AUTHORITY IS IN QUESTION,

05:07.792 --> 05:08.917
YOU START
BARKING OUT ORDERS?

05:08.917 --> 05:10.750
GO. NOW.

05:10.750 --> 05:11.834
BYE, MOM.

05:11.834 --> 05:15.000
BYE, HONEY.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.291
YOU KNOW, I THINK OUR
SON IS TRAINING TO BE
A LAWYER.

05:17.291 --> 05:19.917
HE HAS BECOME THE
MASTER OF
MANIPULATION.

05:19.917 --> 05:21.375
I WONDER WHERE
HE LEARNED THAT.

05:21.375 --> 05:22.625
MEANING?

05:22.625 --> 05:25.708
MEANING YOU BOTH CAN
COME UP WITH INCREDIBLE
RATIONALIZATIONS,

05:25.708 --> 05:28.750
ESPECIALLY WHEN
IT COMES TO ACTING OUT
YOUR SEXUAL IMPULSES.

05:28.750 --> 05:30.917
OH...LISTEN, GALE,

05:30.917 --> 05:34.166
THIS WHOLE IDEA OF AN OPEN
MARRIAGE WAS EXACTLY THAT--
IT WAS AN IDEA.

05:34.166 --> 05:36.708
I'M NOT GONNA FORCE
YOUR HAND INTO ANYTHING
IF YOU'RE AGAINST IT.

05:36.708 --> 05:38.000
ARE YOU AGAINST IT?

05:38.000 --> 05:40.375
WELL, I'M NOT FOR IT.

05:40.375 --> 05:41.834
BUT IF THAT'S
WHAT IT TAKES--

05:41.834 --> 05:43.667
COME ON. NO.
LOOK, ENOUGH SAID.

05:43.667 --> 05:47.208
NO, NO, NO.
IF WHAT YOU NEED IS
TO GET EVEN WITH ME

05:47.208 --> 05:48.708
AND TO SOW YOUR OATS,
THEN--

05:48.708 --> 05:51.166
GALE, LET'S DROP--
LET'S DROP THE WHOLE THING.

05:51.166 --> 05:53.208
I MEAN, I--I DON'T
WANNA FIGHT ABOUT IT.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.000
YOU DON'T?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.125
NO.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.834
I LOVE YOU, MITCH.

06:02.333 --> 06:03.834
I'LL SEE YOU AFTER WORK.

06:03.834 --> 06:05.750
HAVE A GOOD ONE.

06:09.792 --> 06:12.458
JEN, I HAVE A VERY
IMPORTANT QUESTION
FOR YOU,

06:12.458 --> 06:13.792
AND I NEED AN ANSWER
IMMEDIATELY.

06:13.792 --> 06:14.667
WHAT IS IT?

06:14.667 --> 06:16.375
WHO WOULD YOU RATHER
HAVE SEX WITH--

06:16.375 --> 06:17.583
TREY HARTER
OR JEFF BURDIS?

06:17.583 --> 06:19.542
HA. NEITHER.

06:19.542 --> 06:22.834
ARE YOU CRAZY?!
LOOK AT THEM!

06:22.834 --> 06:25.708
WHAT? THEY'RE A COUPLE
OF GYM JUNKIES.

06:25.708 --> 06:28.000
THEY HAVE
NO CULTURAL INTERESTS,
NO INNER LIVES.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.875
ALL THEY DO
IS PLAY FOOTBALL
AND SWAP PORNOS.

06:30.875 --> 06:32.542
THEY'RE
A COUPLE OF PIGS.

06:32.542 --> 06:34.875
YEAH, BUT IT'S LIKE THEY'RE
SO COMPLETELY DISGUSTING,

06:34.875 --> 06:36.041
IT'S ALMOST EROTIC.

06:36.041 --> 06:38.333
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

06:39.500 --> 06:42.125
GOD, I CANNOT BELIEVE
I AM FRIENDS WITH SOMEONE

06:42.125 --> 06:43.875
WHO ONLY HAS EYES
FOR DAWSON LEERY.

06:43.875 --> 06:45.542
GUILTY AS CHARGED.

06:45.542 --> 06:47.041
PLEASE!
YOU'RE MAKING ME ILL.

06:47.041 --> 06:50.667
JEN, LOOK AT ME.

06:50.667 --> 06:53.875
I HAVE 3 WORDS FOR YOU--
MAKE IT HAPPEN.

06:53.875 --> 06:55.542
ABBY--
NO!

06:55.542 --> 06:58.417
DON'T ABBY ME.
MAKE...IT...HAPPEN.

07:05.208 --> 07:07.083
PACEY, WAIT!
LOOK, I NEED YOUR HELP!

07:07.083 --> 07:08.792
OH, GOD, HERE WE GO.

07:08.792 --> 07:11.041
OK. ANDI, I'M HAVING
A REALLY MELLOW MORNING.

07:11.041 --> 07:12.708
I HAVEN'T HAD
ANY CAR ACCIDENTS,

07:12.708 --> 07:14.792
I HAVEN'T
BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH
ANY TERMINAL DEFECTS,

07:14.792 --> 07:16.542
AND I'D REALLY JUST
LIKE TO KEEP A LOW PRO,

07:16.542 --> 07:18.375
SO BUH-BYE.

07:18.375 --> 07:21.750
I'M SURE THERE
ARE A DOZEN DIMWITS WITH
HIGHLIGHTS AND C-CUPS

07:21.750 --> 07:23.417
YOU'D RATHER
BE TALKING TO,

07:23.417 --> 07:25.250
BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY
PERSON I KNOW IN ECON,

07:25.250 --> 07:26.542
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

07:26.542 --> 07:29.041
I LEFT MY BACKPACK
IN MY LOCKER YESTERDAY.

07:29.041 --> 07:30.750
CAN I BORROW YOUR NOTES
ON THE READING?

07:30.750 --> 07:33.583
OK. I DON'T ACTUALLY
HAVE ANY NOTES

07:33.583 --> 07:35.792
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
DO THE READING.

07:35.792 --> 07:39.458
OK, AND DON'T GIVE ME
THE HOMEWORK GUILT TRIP,
ALL RIGHT?

07:39.458 --> 07:40.959
THAT'S WHAT
I HAVE PARENTS FOR.

07:40.959 --> 07:42.625
DID I SAY ANYTHING?

07:42.625 --> 07:43.917
I DID NOT SAY ANYTHING.

07:43.917 --> 07:45.500
I'M JUST FREAKING OUT.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.458
WHAT IF MR. MADDOCK
CALLS ON ME IN CLASS?

07:47.458 --> 07:50.500
THEN YOU DO
WHAT I ALWAYS DO--
YOU JUST SAY "PASS."

07:50.500 --> 07:54.125
HA. PACEY,
I DON'T SAY "PASS."

07:54.125 --> 07:55.917
PASS IS NOT
IN MY VOCABULARY.

07:55.917 --> 07:57.125
THERE'S JUST--
THERE'S NO WAY!

07:57.125 --> 07:59.750
OK. SETTLE DOWN, ALL RIGHT?
THIS IS JUST ONE ASSIGNMENT.

07:59.750 --> 08:02.000
YOU'RE NOT FLUNKING OUT.
YEAH, I KNOW THAT,

08:02.000 --> 08:03.458
BUT YOU GET BEHIND BY ONE DAY,

08:03.458 --> 08:05.083
YOU'RE ALWAYS
STRUGGLING TO CATCH UP.

08:05.083 --> 08:06.583
THEN YOU JUST GET
MORE CONFUSED,

08:06.583 --> 08:08.792
THEN THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE OUT ON THE STREET,

08:08.792 --> 08:10.667
DRUNK AND DIRTY,
WHEELING A SHOPPING CART.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.792
ANDI...YOU'RE RICH.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.250
RICH PEOPLE DON'T
END UP IN THE STREET.

08:14.250 --> 08:16.333
THEY END UP IN FLORIDA.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.500
[BELL RINGS]

08:17.500 --> 08:19.125
OH, NO! YOU'RE DOOMED!

08:19.125 --> 08:20.834
COME ON! NOW,
YOU'VE GOTTA HELP ME!

08:20.834 --> 08:22.375
DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY
THAT DID 'EM?

08:22.375 --> 08:24.166
I MEAN, IS THERE ANYBODY
I CAN BORROW THEM FROM?

08:24.166 --> 08:25.291
MMM. LET ME THINK.

08:25.291 --> 08:27.125
...AND, FINALLY,

08:27.125 --> 08:28.500
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE

08:28.500 --> 08:30.667
BETWEEN MACROECONOMICS
AND MICROECONOMICS?

08:30.667 --> 08:33.291
ANDI?

08:33.291 --> 08:34.332
UM...

08:36.332 --> 08:39.166
MICROECONOMICS
IS...

08:41.500 --> 08:43.917
MICROECONOMICS
IS WHEN...

08:45.500 --> 08:47.458
PASS.

08:47.458 --> 08:49.834
I'M SORRY.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

08:49.834 --> 08:52.208
PASS.

08:52.208 --> 08:54.083
KENNY?

08:54.083 --> 08:56.708
MACROECONOMICS IS
THE STUDY OF WHOLE
ECONOMIC SYSTEMS

08:56.708 --> 08:57.959
AND HOW
THEY INTERRELATE.

08:57.959 --> 09:01.000
MICROECONOMICS
IS THE STUDY

09:01.000 --> 09:03.375
OF
INDIVIDUAL AREAS OF
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

09:03.375 --> 09:05.208
LIKE CORPORATIONS.

09:05.208 --> 09:06.834
VERY GOOD. WELL PUT.
THANK YOU, KENNY.

09:06.834 --> 09:08.834
WHICH LEADS ME
TO YOUR ASSIGNMENT.

09:08.834 --> 09:11.000
WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS
ON THE MICROECONOMICS

09:11.000 --> 09:12.542
OF THE FAMILY HOUSEHOLD.

09:12.542 --> 09:14.208
THIS WEEK,
YOU'RE GOING TO PAIR UP

09:14.208 --> 09:17.834
AND PLAY A LITTLE GAME
I CALL ALTERNATIVE
LIFESTYLES.

09:17.834 --> 09:19.542
NOW,

09:19.542 --> 09:22.875
IN THIS HAT
ARE ALL YOUR NAMES.

09:22.875 --> 09:24.542
YOU'RE GOING TO
CHOOSE A PARTNER,

09:24.542 --> 09:26.375
I WILL ASSIGN YOU
IDENTITIES,

09:26.375 --> 09:29.125
AND THEN YOU ARE TO
PREPARE AN EXTENSIVE
ANNUAL BUDGET

09:29.125 --> 09:30.834
FOR YOUR FICTIONAL
HOUSEHOLD.

09:30.834 --> 09:34.834
I STRONGLY RECOMMEND
RESEARCH TRIPS
INTO THE FIELD.

09:34.834 --> 09:36.375
HOW MUCH MONEY WILL YOU
HAVE TO SPEND A YEAR

09:36.375 --> 09:38.208
ON FOOD, CLOTHING, TRAVEL?

09:38.208 --> 09:40.917
NOW, THESE ARE QUESTIONS
THAT EVERY HOUSEHOLD
MUST ASK,

09:40.917 --> 09:43.375
AND THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS
THAT I WANT YOU TO ANSWER.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.583
SO, LET'S BEGIN.

09:45.583 --> 09:47.166
ANDI.

09:50.458 --> 09:51.875
PACEY WITTER.

09:51.875 --> 09:55.041
YOU AND PACEY ARE
A LOWER-MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY

09:55.041 --> 09:56.625
WITH 3 CHILDREN.

09:56.625 --> 09:58.250
PACEY,
YOU'RE A BUS DRIVER.

09:58.250 --> 09:59.542
ANDI, YOU'RE
A SALES CLERK.

10:03.208 --> 10:04.917
KENNY REILING.

10:04.917 --> 10:07.417
MR. MADDOCK,
IS IT POSSIBLE
TO SWITCH PARTNERS?

10:07.417 --> 10:08.625
NO, IT'S NOT.

10:16.875 --> 10:17.917
HUH! TREY HARTER.

10:17.917 --> 10:18.959
THAT'S ME, MAN.

10:18.959 --> 10:20.458
KILLER, MAN.

10:20.458 --> 10:22.959
NOW, YOU TWO
WILL BE A WELL-TO-DO
SAME-SEX COUPLE.

10:22.959 --> 10:24.708
TREY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE
A PEDIATRICIAN,

10:24.708 --> 10:26.458
JEFF, YOU'RE
AN ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE.

10:26.458 --> 10:28.417
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SAME-SEX?

10:28.417 --> 10:31.125
AS IN GAY, OK?
AND YOU'RE PLANNING
ON GETTING MARRIED,

10:31.125 --> 10:33.250
WEDDING EXPENSES
HAVE GOT TO BE
IN YOUR BUDGET.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.125
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN GAY?

10:42.041 --> 10:43.333
JEN LINDLEY.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.083
OK, UH, A WEALTHY COUPLE.

10:45.083 --> 10:46.458
DAWSON, YOU'RE
A STOCKBROKER,

10:46.458 --> 10:47.917
JEN, YOU'RE A ENGINEER,

10:47.917 --> 10:49.125
YOU GOT 2 KIDS
IN COLLEGE,

10:49.125 --> 10:51.625
A HOUSE AT THE BEACH,
ANNUAL INCOME...

10:51.625 --> 10:53.458
$400,000 A YEAR.

10:53.458 --> 10:57.208
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST,

10:57.208 --> 10:58.625
JOEY POTTER.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.291
ODD WOMAN OUT.

11:00.291 --> 11:02.333
THAT'S OK, JOEY,
UH, YOU WILL BE

11:02.333 --> 11:03.625
A SUCCESSFUL
SINGLE MOTHER

11:03.625 --> 11:05.834
RAISING 2 KIDS
ON YOUR OWN.

11:05.834 --> 11:07.291
THAT EVERYBODY?

11:07.291 --> 11:09.041
GOOD LUCK,

11:09.041 --> 11:10.875
AND DON'T SPEND
ALL YOUR MONEY
IN ONE PLACE.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.625
THIS ASSIGNMENT
IS SO LAME.

11:12.625 --> 11:15.041
I MEAN, PRETENDING
TO BE SOMETHING WE'RE
NEVER GOING TO BE,

11:15.041 --> 11:16.959
BUDGETING MONEY
WE'RE NEVER
GOING TO HAVE.

11:16.959 --> 11:18.208
I MEAN,
WHAT'S THE POINT?

11:18.208 --> 11:20.166
THE POINT IS
TO GET US THINKING

11:20.166 --> 11:22.542
ABOUT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS
WE WILL FACE
IN THE REAL WORLD.

11:22.542 --> 11:24.333
I HATE TO BREAK IT
TO YOU, PETER PAN,

11:24.333 --> 11:26.834
BUT SOME OF US
ARE ALREADY DEALING
WITH THOSE PROBLEMS.

11:26.834 --> 11:29.000
I MEAN, IT JUST GETS ME
THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE

11:29.000 --> 11:31.166
AND HOW I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M GOING
TO DO WITH MY LIFE.

11:31.166 --> 11:32.500
YOU HAVE AN IDEA.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.041
I DON'T.
THAT'S YOU, DAWSON.

11:35.041 --> 11:36.458
YOU'VE GOT IT
ALL MAPPED OUT.

11:36.458 --> 11:37.875
YOU'RE GOING TO GO
OFF TO HOLLYWOOD,

11:37.875 --> 11:40.000
BECOME SOME HIGH-PROFILE
MOVIE DIRECTOR,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.125
MAKE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS,
GET A DRUG ADDICTION,

11:42.125 --> 11:43.333
END UP AT
THE BETTY FORD CENTER,

11:43.333 --> 11:44.834
MARRY SOME...

11:44.834 --> 11:46.625
EXCUSE ME?

11:46.625 --> 11:48.125
AND ME, I MEAN,
WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES

11:48.125 --> 11:49.834
AND THINK ABOUT WHERE
I'LL BE IN 10 YEARS,

11:49.834 --> 11:52.041
IT'S BLANK. I MEAN,
I HAVE NO IDEA, DAWSON.

11:52.041 --> 11:52.917
YOU WILL.

11:52.917 --> 11:54.208
ONE DAY.

11:54.208 --> 11:56.708
THIS PROJECT IS JUST
GOING TO DEPRESS ME.

11:56.708 --> 11:59.125
IT THINK
IT'LL BE FUN.

11:59.125 --> 12:00.500
OH, REALLY?

12:00.500 --> 12:01.917
AND ARE YOU AS EXCITED

12:01.917 --> 12:04.708
TO PARTNER UP
WITH JEN AS SHE IS?

12:04.708 --> 12:06.750
THE LOOK ON HER FACE
WAS CLASSIC, DAWSON.

12:06.750 --> 12:08.750
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

12:14.542 --> 12:16.625
FAMOUS LAST WORDS.

12:28.708 --> 12:31.583
OH, JEN,
YOU'RE DROOLING!

12:31.583 --> 12:33.542
LOOK, THIS IS
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.

12:33.542 --> 12:34.917
YOU'RE GOING TO
BE WORKING WITH HIM

12:34.917 --> 12:36.875
ALL WEEK LONG
ONE-ON-ONE,

12:36.875 --> 12:38.458
SO THE QUESTION IS

12:38.458 --> 12:39.708
ARE YOU GOING
TO BE PASSIVE

12:39.708 --> 12:41.208
AND MASOCHISTIC,

12:41.208 --> 12:42.667
AND REALLY PISS ME
OFF,

12:42.667 --> 12:44.125
OR ARE YOU GOING
TO BE PROACTIVE

12:44.125 --> 12:45.417
AND GRAB HIM
BY THE DIPSTICK

12:45.417 --> 12:47.041
AND MAKE ME PROUD?

12:47.041 --> 12:49.375
ABBY, IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
I MEAN, TAKE A LOOK AT HIM.

12:49.375 --> 12:51.542
HE'S TOTALLY INTO JOEY.
HE'S IN LOVE WITH HER.

12:51.542 --> 12:53.583
AH, HE'S
A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY.

12:53.583 --> 12:55.375
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT LOVE IS.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.041
ALL HE DOES KNOW

12:57.041 --> 12:59.708
IS THAT HE GOES
TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT
JERKING HIS GHERKIN

12:59.708 --> 13:00.917
AND HE WAKES UP
EVERY MORNING

13:00.917 --> 13:02.667
HUMPING
HIS MATTRESS.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.083
EXCUSE ME, ABBY. UH...

13:07.083 --> 13:08.750
WHAT? WHO ARE YOU?

13:08.750 --> 13:10.583
KENNY REILING.
I'M YOUR PARTNER IN ECON.

13:10.583 --> 13:12.458
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
GO AWAY.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.000
LOOK, I THOUGHT
WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT OUR ASSIGNMENT.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.250
LOOK, UM,
CAN YOU JUST DO
THE ASSIGNMENT

13:17.250 --> 13:18.625
AND PUT MY NAME
ON IT?

13:18.625 --> 13:22.083
'CAUSE THAT
WOULD BE GREAT.
THANKS. BYE.

13:22.083 --> 13:23.458
ANYWAY,

13:23.458 --> 13:24.959
I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR A LITTLE BIT

13:24.959 --> 13:26.625
OF THIS
NEW YORK CITY
REGRESSION.

13:26.625 --> 13:29.834
I MEAN,
YOU HAVE TO SHOW HIM
THE OLD NAUGHTY JEN.

13:29.834 --> 13:31.959
'CAUSE THIS NEW JEN
JUST ISN'T WORKING.

13:31.959 --> 13:34.083
I MEAN, YOU'RE
GOING TO BE WORKING
TOGETHER ALL WEEK.

13:34.083 --> 13:35.750
IT'S A PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY.

13:35.750 --> 13:37.625
LATE NIGHT
STUDY SESSIONS,

13:37.625 --> 13:39.959
ROLE PLAYING
LIKE YOU GUYS ARE
HUSBAND AND WIFE,

13:39.959 --> 13:42.333
AND YOU CAN REMIND HIM
WHAT A GREAT COUPLE
YOU USED TO BE

13:42.333 --> 13:43.458
AND HOW COMPATIBLE
YOU ARE.

13:43.458 --> 13:45.291
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, I--

13:45.291 --> 13:46.959
I DON'T WANT TO JUMP
THE GUN, YOU KNOW.

13:46.959 --> 13:49.792
I WANT YOU TO JUMP
THE GUN. HIS GUN.

13:49.792 --> 13:52.708
AND I WANT ALL
THE GORY DETAILS.

14:18.166 --> 14:19.667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:19.667 --> 14:20.875
HAVEN'T YOU EVER
MOPPED BEFORE?

14:20.875 --> 14:22.291
YOU DIP THE MOP
IN THE BUCKET.

14:22.291 --> 14:23.875
DON'T POUR THE WATER
ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

14:23.875 --> 14:25.333
UH, SORRY.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.500
LOOK, I KNOW I MADE
A FEW BLUNDERS,

14:27.500 --> 14:30.333
BUT I'M NOT
A SCREWUP.

14:30.333 --> 14:32.834
IT'S OK. HERE, I'LL DO IT.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

14:32.834 --> 14:34.583
ALL RIGHT, JUST GO
WIPE OFF SOME COUNTERS.

14:40.041 --> 14:42.041
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
IS SOMETHING FLOODING?

14:42.041 --> 14:44.250
NO. JACK--NEVER MIND.

14:44.250 --> 14:47.375
I'M TAKING CARE OF IT,
BUT CAN WE SAVE SOME OF
THIS CLEANUP FOR TOMORROW?

14:47.375 --> 14:49.333
NO. THIS WEEK
WE HAVE TO STAY
ON TOP OF EVERYTHING.

14:49.333 --> 14:51.041
I'M SO PARANOID
THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S

14:51.041 --> 14:52.917
JUST GOING TO JUMP
DOWN OUR THROATS.

14:52.917 --> 14:54.667
I HAVE THIS HUGE ECON PROJECT
DUE FRIDAY.

14:54.667 --> 14:55.750
IT'S WORTH
A THIRD OF MY GRADE.

14:55.750 --> 14:57.667
I HAVE TO PREPARE
THIS HOUSEHOLD BUDGET

14:57.667 --> 14:58.834
FOR A SINGLE
CAREER MOTHER,

14:58.834 --> 15:00.834
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M DOING.

15:00.834 --> 15:02.375
I'M VIRTUALLY
A SINGLE CAREER MOTHER.

15:02.375 --> 15:04.750
I CAN HELP YOU. WHAT
DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?

15:04.750 --> 15:07.542
THANKS, BESS, BUT
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY THE MODEL
FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT.

15:07.542 --> 15:09.166
WHY NOT?

15:09.166 --> 15:11.208
FIRST OF ALL,
SHE'S A SUPERSUCCESSFUL
CAREER WOMAN

15:11.208 --> 15:13.041
WITH $150,000 INCOME.

15:13.041 --> 15:15.375
WELL, JOEY, MAYBE
I'M NOT SUPERSUCCESSFUL,

15:15.375 --> 15:19.250
BUT IF THERE'S ONE THING
I DO KNOW HOW TO DO,
IT'S BUDGET MONEY.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.375
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I SHOULD GET SOME ADVICE.

15:21.375 --> 15:23.583
FIND A CAREER WOMAN
WHO'S ACTUALLY LIVING
THIS ASSIGNMENT,

15:23.583 --> 15:24.750
ASK HER FOR HELP.

15:24.750 --> 15:27.250
HELLO. I'LL DO IT.

15:27.250 --> 15:29.208
YOU KEEP CLEANING,
AND I'LL ADVISE.

15:29.208 --> 15:31.041
THANKS, BESS,
BUT YOU CAN BARELY
GET YOUR BILLS

15:31.041 --> 15:32.875
PAID ON TIME.

15:32.875 --> 15:35.291
I APPRECIATE
THE OFFER, BUT I THINK
I'LL FIND SOMEBODY ELSE.

15:41.875 --> 15:44.208
DUDE, CHECK OUT
THIS VIPER.

15:44.208 --> 15:47.583
PACEY, CAN YOU
PLEASE PUT THAT DOWN
FOR ONE SECOND?

15:47.583 --> 15:49.375
IS THAT POSSIBLE?

15:49.375 --> 15:52.583
WE ARE SERIOUSLY
OVER BUDGET
BY, LIKE, $30,000.

15:52.583 --> 15:54.583
THAT'S FINE.

15:54.583 --> 15:56.083
DON'T REALLY
NEED A JACUZZI.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.250
AS LONG AS I
GET THIS VIPER,
EVERYTHING'S OK.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.417
HUH, NO.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.708
YOU ARE A BUS DRIVER,

16:00.708 --> 16:01.959
AND I AM A SALES CLERK.

16:01.959 --> 16:03.667
YOU'RE NOT GETTING
ANY VIPER.

16:03.667 --> 16:05.750
OK, I THINK
THE FIRST DECISION
WE SHOULD MAKE

16:05.750 --> 16:07.083
IS WHERE
WE'RE GOING TO LIVE,

16:07.083 --> 16:08.458
AND SINCE
WE HAVE 3 KIDS,

16:08.458 --> 16:09.959
WE SHOULD GET
A 4-BEDROOM HOUSE.

16:09.959 --> 16:11.417
KIDS DON'T NEED
THEIR OWN ROOMS.

16:11.417 --> 16:13.583
YOU KNOW,
NOT EVERYBODY GETS
TO GROW UP LIKE YOU,

16:13.583 --> 16:14.792
A FAIRY PRINCESS.

16:14.792 --> 16:16.417
I WANT A DIVORCE.

16:16.417 --> 16:18.291
GRANTED.
YOU KNOW WHAT,
WE SPLIT THE CASH,

16:18.291 --> 16:19.750
YOU
CAN HAVE THE KIDS,
I'LL KEEP THE CAR.

16:19.750 --> 16:21.917
THAT IS SO TYPICAL.

16:21.917 --> 16:24.125
DOESN'T IT SICKEN YOU
THAT YOU'RE LIVING UP

16:24.125 --> 16:26.959
TO THE MOST COMMON AND
BASE OF MALE STEREOTYPES?

16:26.959 --> 16:29.041
YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR WIFE
AND KIDS, NO.

16:29.041 --> 16:32.291
ALL YOU CARE ABOUT
IS THIS OVERPRICED,
ABSURD PIECE OF METAL.

16:32.291 --> 16:35.125
HEY, IT'S GOT
PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAGS.

16:35.125 --> 16:36.708
LOOK, I WANT A VIPER,
OK? THAT'S IT.

16:36.708 --> 16:38.834
END OF STORY.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.625
OK. COMPROMISE.

16:42.625 --> 16:44.250
YOU'LL GET YOUR VIPER

16:44.250 --> 16:47.041
IF AND ONLY IF
WE CAN FIND A VIABLE
2-BEDROOM APARTMENT.

16:47.041 --> 16:48.333
HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

16:48.333 --> 16:51.166
WELL, MR. MADDOCK SAID
WE SHOULD DO SOME RESEARCH
IN THE FIELD,

16:51.166 --> 16:53.291
SO LET'S GO
APARTMENT SCOUTING.

17:08.791 --> 17:10.333
I'LL GET YOU THOSE NUMBERS
TOMORROW.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.708
OKAY, TAKE CARE.
I WILL.

17:12.708 --> 17:13.834
HAVE A NICE EVENING.

17:13.834 --> 17:15.708
THANKS FOR THE RIDE.

17:15.708 --> 17:16.916
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
BYE. OK.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.375
HI, HONEY.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.250
WHERE'S DAWSON?

17:31.250 --> 17:33.583
HE'S, UH,
STUDYING NEXT DOOR.

17:33.583 --> 17:36.834
OH, WHAT A DAY.

17:36.834 --> 17:38.542
YEAH, I'LL BET.

17:38.542 --> 17:40.542
I MISSED A DEADLINE,
THE CAR
WOULDN'T START,

17:40.542 --> 17:43.291
FRANK FROM
ACCOUNTING HAD TO
GIVE ME A RIDE HOME.

17:43.291 --> 17:44.834
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

17:44.834 --> 17:47.667
JUST THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE EASIER
IF I GOT A RIDE.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.834
FROM, UH, FRANK
IN ACCOUNTING.

17:50.834 --> 17:53.542
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE MAD ABOUT THAT.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.000
LOOK, GALE, I KNOW
THAT FRANK JUST GAVE YOU
A RIDE HOME,

18:00.000 --> 18:01.458
BUT I CAN'T STOP
HOW I FEEL.

18:01.458 --> 18:03.625
NOW, WE'VE LOST IT HERE.
THERE'S NO TRUST HERE.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.083
THERE'S NO HONESTY.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.208
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO TO GET IT BACK.

18:10.583 --> 18:13.041
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE
THIS IDEA, MAYBE THIS
OPEN MARRIAGE THING--

18:13.041 --> 18:14.083
MITCH--

18:14.083 --> 18:17.083
NOW, WAIT, WAIT,
JUST HEAR ME OUT.

18:17.083 --> 18:18.792
MAYBE,

18:18.792 --> 18:22.458
BY TAKING AWAY THE RULES,

18:22.458 --> 18:26.208
I CAN TAKE AWAY
THE NEED TO TRUST YOU,

18:26.208 --> 18:29.417
AND WE CAN GET BACK SOME
OF WHAT WE'VE LOST.

18:29.417 --> 18:31.417
MEANING?

18:31.417 --> 18:32.917
MEANING
FROM THIS MOMENT ON,

18:32.917 --> 18:35.417
THURSDAY NIGHT
IS DATE NIGHT.

18:35.417 --> 18:37.125
WE CAN GO OUT
WITH WHOMEVER WE WANT,

18:37.125 --> 18:39.250
DO WHATEVER WE WANT
WHENEVER WE WANT,

18:39.250 --> 18:41.542
AND THE ONLY RULE

18:41.542 --> 18:42.750
IS WE'RE HONEST
ABOUT IT.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.750
SEE, THERE'S
NO NEED TO LIE.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.500
AN OPEN MARRIAGE
ALLOWS US THAT.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.959
HUH! MAYBE WE
SHOULD SEND OUR KIDS
TO STATE SCHOOL.

18:56.959 --> 18:59.125
IT WOULD BE A HELL
OF A LOT CHEAPER.

18:59.125 --> 19:01.625
DAWSON, IF WE
HAD KIDS, THEY'D BE
IVY LEAGUE MATERIAL.

19:01.625 --> 19:03.458
THESE PRICES
ARE ASTRONOMICAL.

19:03.458 --> 19:04.917
ACCORDING TO
OUR TAX BRACKET,

19:04.917 --> 19:06.750
WE WOULD HAVE TO
EARN $60,000 A YEAR

19:06.750 --> 19:08.667
JUST TO SEND ONE KID
TO ONE YEAR OF COLLEGE.

19:08.667 --> 19:12.125
IT'S SUCH A RIP-OFF.

19:12.125 --> 19:13.834
WHAT ARE YOU--WHAT
ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?

19:13.834 --> 19:16.500
THIS CONVERSATION.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.125
I MEAN,
LISTEN TO US.

19:18.125 --> 19:20.750
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT OUR MORTGAGES,

19:20.750 --> 19:24.583
HOW WE'RE GOING TO AFFORD
TO SEND OUR KIDS TO COLLEGE.

19:24.583 --> 19:26.417
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S LIKE
WE'RE ACTUALLY MARRIED.

19:26.417 --> 19:28.959
HMM.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.166
WHO KNOWS? 20 YEARS
ON DOWN THE LINE,

19:31.166 --> 19:32.959
IT COULD BE US.

19:34.375 --> 19:36.125
WELL, I THINK THESE
TRAVEL EXPENSES

19:36.125 --> 19:37.291
ARE A LITTLE BIT
UNREALISTIC.

19:37.291 --> 19:38.708
I MEAN, WE'RE
GOING TO WANT TO GO

19:38.708 --> 19:40.208
SOMEPLACE WARM IN
THE WINTER, RIGHT?

19:40.208 --> 19:43.000
YEAH. SOME PLACE LIKE
THE FLORIDA KEYS OR--

19:43.000 --> 19:44.208
I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO HAWAII.

19:44.208 --> 19:45.458
JAMAICA.

19:47.125 --> 19:48.291
OR HOW ABOUT FIJI?

19:48.291 --> 19:50.291
FIJI. I CAN
TOTALLY DO FIJI.

19:50.291 --> 19:51.792
THAT WOULD BE COOL.

19:51.792 --> 19:53.667
UH, WE SHOULD, UM,
CALL A TRAVEL AGENT,

19:53.667 --> 19:55.041
DO SOME
PRICE-CHECKING.

19:55.041 --> 19:57.667
SHOULD WE TAKE
THE KIDS?

19:57.667 --> 20:00.959
NO. THEY'RE IN COLLEGE.
THEY PROBABLY WON'T WANT
TO GO WITH US.

20:00.959 --> 20:02.875
YEAH. PROBABLY
SICK OF US.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.917
BESIDES, IF WE GO ALONE,
IT'S MUCH MORE ROMANTIC.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.917
GOD, THAT'S--WE'VE AGREED
ON PRACTICALLY EVERY ASPECT

20:11.917 --> 20:13.375
OF MARRIED LIFE.

20:13.375 --> 20:16.500
I DON'T THINK WE COULD
REALLY BE MORE COMPATIBLE.

20:18.041 --> 20:19.333
HMM!

20:22.542 --> 20:24.708
YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND
OF A RELIEF TO SEE

20:24.708 --> 20:26.542
THAT YOU AND ME
CAN STILL HANG OUT,
YOU KNOW?

20:26.542 --> 20:29.834
YEAH.

20:29.834 --> 20:31.667
I MEAN, IT'S FUN,
AND THERE'S MOMENTS

20:31.667 --> 20:33.708
WHEN IT FEELS

20:33.708 --> 20:35.792
LIKE NOTHING'S REALLY
CHANGED BETWEEN US.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.750
KIND OF LIKE RIGHT NOW.

20:47.959 --> 20:49.750
WELL, YEAH.

20:49.750 --> 20:51.750
WE'VE PROBABLY
DONE ENOUGH WORK
FOR TONIGHT.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.208
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:58.417 --> 21:01.250
HEY, DAWSON, UM,

21:01.250 --> 21:04.208
IF YOU HAPPEN TO
GET ANY INSPIRATION
ON THE ASSIGNMENT

21:04.208 --> 21:07.583
OR, YOU KNOW,
JUST WANT TO TALK,
WHATEVER, RIGHT?

21:07.583 --> 21:08.959
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

21:08.959 --> 21:11.458
MY DOOR'S
ALWAYS OPEN.

21:11.458 --> 21:14.041
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

21:15.917 --> 21:17.750
I THINK SO.

21:17.750 --> 21:18.917
I--I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW.

21:18.917 --> 21:21.208
BYE.

21:30.583 --> 21:31.542
WHAT IS THAT?

21:31.542 --> 21:33.083
RAT TRAP.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.667
WE HAVE A LITTLE
VERMIN INFESTATION.

21:34.667 --> 21:35.875
NOT A BIG DEAL.

21:35.875 --> 21:37.625
UM. ARE YOU RENTING

21:37.625 --> 21:39.000
[COUGHS]
THE PLACE AS IS?

21:39.000 --> 21:41.458
YUP. AS IS.

21:41.458 --> 21:43.417
HMM. STILL WANT
THAT VIPER?

21:43.417 --> 21:45.125
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

21:45.125 --> 21:47.625
ARE WE DOING
THIS PROJECT, OR ARE
WE MOVING IN TOGETHER?

21:47.625 --> 21:49.834
WE'VE LOOKED AT,
LIKE, 12 DIFFERENT
APARTMENT BUILDINGS,

21:49.834 --> 21:51.291
AND FOR WHAT?

21:51.291 --> 21:54.750
RESEARCH. MR. MADDOCK
TOLD US TO DO RESEARCH.

21:54.750 --> 21:56.625
YEAH,
BUT THE ASSIGNMENT
IS DUE TOMORROW,

21:56.625 --> 21:58.792
AND WE DON'T HAVE
A THING ON PAPER.

21:58.792 --> 22:00.375
IS THAT MY FAULT?

22:00.375 --> 22:02.250
YES, IT IS YOUR FAULT.

22:02.250 --> 22:03.667
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S BEEN LEADING US

22:03.667 --> 22:05.834
ON THIS
RIDICULOUS APARTMENT
SCAVENGER HUNT.

22:07.291 --> 22:08.959
I'M SORRY.

22:08.959 --> 22:11.625
I'M SORRY
I ACTUALLY GOT INTO
THIS PROJECT, PACEY.

22:11.625 --> 22:14.250
I'M SORRY I'M NOT
THE BIGGEST SLACKER
ON THE PLANET.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.542
AFTER ALL THIS,
YOU STILL THINK
I'M LAZY.

22:16.542 --> 22:18.333
HA. NO, PACEY.

22:18.333 --> 22:20.333
THERE'S LAZY, AND--
THEN THERE'S YOU.

22:20.333 --> 22:23.333
ARE YOU TRYING TO WIN
SOME TEEN REBEL AWARD?

22:23.333 --> 22:24.834
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK

22:24.834 --> 22:27.834
IT'S COOL
TO GIVE THE FINGER TO
EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE

22:27.834 --> 22:31.125
THAT DOESN'T FIT
INTO YOUR LITTLE
SELF-DESTRUCTIVE AGENDA?

22:31.125 --> 22:32.667
OK, LET'S GET
ONE THING STRAIGHT.

22:32.667 --> 22:34.041
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME.

22:34.041 --> 22:35.208
WELL, ENLIGHTEN ME.

22:35.208 --> 22:37.875
MY ECON GRADE DEPENDS ON IT.
FINE.

22:37.875 --> 22:40.166
YOU WANT THE BROKEN
RECORD, HERE IT IS.

22:40.166 --> 22:41.792
SINCE BEFORE
THE DAWN OF TIME,

22:41.792 --> 22:43.959
I HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED
THE BLACK SHEEP
OF MY FAMILY.

22:43.959 --> 22:45.834
THIS LABEL IS PERMANENT.
I CAN'T ERASE IT,

22:45.834 --> 22:47.500
AND I CAN'T TRADE IT IN
FOR A NEW ONE.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.625
I COULD BRING HOME
AN "A" IN ECON
OR AN "F."

22:49.625 --> 22:51.333
I COULD BRING HOME
THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE,

22:51.333 --> 22:53.333
IT WOULDN'T MAKE
THE SLIGHTEST BIT
OF DIFFERENCE.

22:53.333 --> 22:54.834
SO, MISS PERKY,

22:54.834 --> 22:57.166
YOU TRY GROWING UP
IN A FAMILY ATMOSPHERE
LIKE THAT

22:57.166 --> 22:58.583
AND SEE IF YOU
CAN STAY MOTIVATED.

22:58.583 --> 23:00.875
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T
MEAN TO, UH--

23:00.875 --> 23:02.208
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

23:02.208 --> 23:04.250
YOU WERE
TOO BUSY GETTING
INTO CHARACTER.

23:04.250 --> 23:05.792
OH, I'M JUST
A SALES CLERK,

23:05.792 --> 23:07.041
A POOR LITTLE
SALES CLERK

23:07.041 --> 23:08.375
LOOKING
FOR AN APARTMENT.

23:08.375 --> 23:09.834
YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE REASON

23:09.834 --> 23:11.875
THAT THIS ASSIGNMENT
IS SO FASCINATING
TO YOU?

23:11.875 --> 23:13.708
IN REALITY, YOU'VE
NEVER HAD A PROBLEM

23:13.708 --> 23:15.250
IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

23:15.250 --> 23:17.375
YOU DRIVE AROUND IN YOUR SAAB,
YOU BUY YOUR NEW CLOTHES,

23:17.375 --> 23:19.166
YOU BASICALLY THROW
YOUR MONEY AWAY.

23:19.166 --> 23:20.542
THE IDEA
THAT PEOPLE

23:20.542 --> 23:22.542
ACTUALLY
HAVE TO BUDGET
THEIR MONTHLY INCOME

23:22.542 --> 23:24.250
IS LIKE SOME
FASCINATING NOVELTY
TO YOU.

23:24.250 --> 23:25.750
YOU'RE RICH,
AND YOU'RE SPOILED,

23:25.750 --> 23:27.208
AND THAT'S WHAT
IT COMES DOWN TO.

23:29.708 --> 23:31.333
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

23:31.333 --> 23:33.166
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU,

23:33.166 --> 23:34.834
AND YOU KNOW
EVEN LESS ABOUT ME,

23:34.834 --> 23:36.166
SO JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!

23:39.542 --> 23:41.333
ANDI, WAIT. HEY.

23:42.583 --> 23:44.083
SO?

23:44.083 --> 23:45.834
ARE YOU GOING TO
TAKE THE APARTMENT?

23:54.583 --> 23:56.750
HI.

23:56.750 --> 23:58.333
HI, I'M JOEY POTTER.

23:58.333 --> 24:00.291
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR SEEING ME,
MISS WESTON.

24:00.291 --> 24:02.417
OH, PLEASE, JOEY,
CALL ME LAURA.

24:02.417 --> 24:03.875
I KNOW YOU MUST
BE INCREDIBLY BUSY,

24:03.875 --> 24:05.708
BUT I'M PREPARING
THIS HOUSEHOLD
BUDGET.

24:05.708 --> 24:07.083
MR. MADDOCK GAVE ME
YOUR NAME.

24:07.083 --> 24:08.667
HE SAID
YOU'RE THE LIVING
EMBODIMENT

24:08.667 --> 24:11.041
OF A SUCCESSFUL
CAREER WOMAN.

24:11.041 --> 24:12.417
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

24:12.417 --> 24:14.542
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST NEVER THOUGHT
THE DAY WOULD COME

24:14.542 --> 24:15.750
THAT I WOULD BE DESCRIBED

24:15.750 --> 24:17.917
AS THE EMBODIMENT OF
A SUCCESSFUL CAREER WOMAN.

24:17.917 --> 24:19.708
CAN YOU BRING ME
THE FARLEY PORTFOLIO?

24:19.708 --> 24:21.583
I NEED TO LOOK AT IT
BEFORE THE MEETING.

24:21.583 --> 24:23.458
WELL, YOU
MUST'VE ALWAYS BEEN
PRETTY AMBITIOUS

24:23.458 --> 24:24.792
TO BE DOING
SO WELL. I MEAN--

24:24.792 --> 24:26.125
OH, AMBITIOUS.
ARE YOU KIDDING?

24:26.125 --> 24:28.083
NOT AT ALL.

24:28.083 --> 24:30.625
A FEW YEARS AGO,
I WAS THE QUINTESSENTIAL
HOUSEWIFE,

24:30.625 --> 24:33.583
RAISING KIDS,
STAYING AT HOME, NO JOB.

24:33.583 --> 24:35.583
GROWING UP, I'D ALWAYS
LOVED ART AND DRAWINGS,

24:35.583 --> 24:36.917
SO I DECIDED TO GO
BACK TO SCHOOL.

24:36.917 --> 24:38.417
NOW, I'M TEACHING ART,

24:38.417 --> 24:40.291
AND WORKING
AS AN INTERIOR DESIGNER.

24:40.291 --> 24:42.792
IT'S GREAT, BECAUSE
I SPEND HALF MY TIME
TEACHING, WHICH I LOVE,

24:42.792 --> 24:43.834
AND THE OTHER HALF
IN DESIGN.

24:43.834 --> 24:46.458
THANKS.

24:46.458 --> 24:48.125
WELL, YOU MUST BE
INCREDIBLY TALENTED.

24:48.125 --> 24:50.250
INCREDIBLY
HARDWORKING
IS WHAT I AM.

24:50.250 --> 24:51.625
NOW, JOEY, WE'RE
DOING THE DESIGNS

24:51.625 --> 24:53.417
FOR A CHAIN
OF MEXICAN RESTAURANTS.

24:53.417 --> 24:54.708
COME TAKE A LOOK
AT THESE FLOOR PLANS.

24:56.166 --> 24:57.959
THEY LOOK GOOD TO ME.

24:57.959 --> 25:00.333
NO, LOOK CLOSER.
DO YOU SEE ANY
POTENTIAL PROBLEMS?

25:03.166 --> 25:05.000
WELL...

25:05.000 --> 25:06.041
NEVER MIND.

25:06.041 --> 25:07.875
NO, NO. WHAT IS IT?

25:07.875 --> 25:10.333
WELL, IT'S JUST
THAT YOU PLACED
THE KITCHEN AND THE BAR

25:10.333 --> 25:11.834
AT OPPOSITE ENDS
OF THE RESTAURANT.

25:11.834 --> 25:14.667
AND WHY IS THAT
A PROBLEM?

25:14.667 --> 25:17.625
WELL, I WORK IN A RESTAURANT,
AND BY DOING THAT

25:17.625 --> 25:19.500
THEN THE WAITERS HAVE TO PLACE
THE KITCHEN ORDERS

25:19.500 --> 25:21.041
AND THE DRINK ORDERS
SEPARATELY.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.333
EVERYTHING TAKES
TWICE AS LONG,

25:22.333 --> 25:23.667
AND YOU END UP
RUNNING AROUND

25:23.667 --> 25:25.333
LIKE A CHICKEN
WITH ITS HEAD CUT OFF.

25:25.333 --> 25:27.000
YOU THINK
MAYBE I COULD PICK
YOUR BRAIN

25:27.000 --> 25:29.458
ABOUT SOME OF THESE OTHER
DESIGNS, A LITTLE TRADE-OFF

25:29.458 --> 25:31.959
FOR HELPING YOU
ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?

25:31.959 --> 25:33.000
FAIR ENOUGH.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.291
I'D BE HAPPY TO.

25:34.291 --> 25:36.125
GOOD.

25:37.834 --> 25:39.166
NOTHING?

25:39.166 --> 25:41.000
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING
WITH HIM ALL WEEK,

25:41.000 --> 25:43.708
AND YOU EXPECT ME TO
BELIEVE THAT NOTHING
HAS HAPPENED?

25:43.708 --> 25:45.667
I'M TELLING YOU,
NOTHING HAS
HAPPENED.

25:45.667 --> 25:47.375
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN,

25:47.375 --> 25:49.875
HE'S SO
HEAD-OVER-HEELS
IN LOVE WITH JOEY,

25:49.875 --> 25:51.208
I CAN'T COMPETE
WITH HER.

25:51.208 --> 25:52.375
THAT IS WHERE
YOU'RE WRONG.

25:52.375 --> 25:54.875
JOEY HAS NOTHING
ON YOU.

25:54.875 --> 25:56.708
KENNY,

25:56.708 --> 25:58.041
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF JOEY POTTER?

25:58.041 --> 25:59.333
SHE'S HOT!

25:59.333 --> 26:01.333
OH, SHUT UP!
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

26:01.333 --> 26:02.917
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY
WALL-EYED.

26:02.917 --> 26:05.041
WELL, LOOK,

26:05.041 --> 26:07.333
ABBY, I DO KNOW
WE SHOULD BE WORKING
ON OUR ASSIGNMENT.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.708
OK, YOU'RE BUGGING ME.
CAN YOU JUST GET OUT
OF MY HAIR

26:09.708 --> 26:11.333
AND GO FINISH IT?

26:11.333 --> 26:14.083
LOOK, ABBY, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
DOING YOUR SHARE OF THE WORK.

26:14.083 --> 26:16.500
WELL, WHAT
DO YOU EXPECT?

26:16.500 --> 26:18.458
I'M NOT LIKE YOU, KENNY.

26:18.458 --> 26:20.583
I HAVE A VERY DEMANDING
SOCIAL LIFE.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.750
ANYWAY, JOEY
MAY BE PRETTY.

26:27.750 --> 26:30.083
SHE DOES HAVE
THAT FRESH-FACED
APPEAL

26:30.083 --> 26:32.125
IN A VERY J. CREW
CATALOGUE KIND OF WAY,

26:32.125 --> 26:33.583
BUT SHE'S NO YOU.

26:33.583 --> 26:36.417
YOU'RE A SEX KITTEN,
JEN,

26:36.417 --> 26:38.083
AND YOU SHOULD WORK IT
TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.

26:38.083 --> 26:39.542
OH, WHAT ARE
YOU SAYING?

26:39.542 --> 26:41.625
THAT I--I SHOULD
JUST TAKE OFF
ALL MY CLOTHES

26:41.625 --> 26:42.792
AND THROW MYSELF
AT HIM?

26:42.792 --> 26:44.375
IT COULD WORK.

26:44.375 --> 26:46.583
OPPORTUNITY IS NOT
A LENGTHY VISITOR,

26:46.583 --> 26:48.708
AND TONIGHT
IS YOUR LAST NIGHT
WITH HIM.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.375
I MEAN, YOU HAVE
TO GO FOR BROKE.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.417
WEAR SOMETHING
SCANDALOUS.

26:52.417 --> 26:54.041
YOU CAN BORROW
ONE OF MY DRESSES

26:54.041 --> 26:57.208
AND JUST SPRAY PERFUME
IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES.

26:57.208 --> 27:01.917
BIG, RED, MOIST LIPS.

27:01.917 --> 27:03.542
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

27:05.250 --> 27:06.875
I MAY AS WELL
PUT THE FINAL NAIL

27:06.875 --> 27:08.000
IN MY COFFIN
OF SHAME.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.083
WHAT HAVE I
GOT TO LOSE?

27:09.083 --> 27:10.625
YEAH. JUST SEDUCE HIM.

27:10.625 --> 27:12.625
HIS TIDY WHITIES
WILL BE IN A BALL

27:12.625 --> 27:14.667
BY THE FOOT OF THE BED
BEFORE YOU CAN SAY

27:14.667 --> 27:16.375
JOEY POTTER IS A VIRGIN.

27:31.959 --> 27:33.959
DINNER'S READY.

27:33.959 --> 27:36.959
WELL, I MADE
OTHER PLANS, GALE.

27:39.083 --> 27:40.125
IT'S THURSDAY.

27:40.125 --> 27:42.291
AH, THURSDAY, RIGHT.

27:42.291 --> 27:44.375
UM,

27:44.375 --> 27:46.542
WELL THEN, UH,

27:46.542 --> 27:49.667
YOU HAVE FUN.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.083
RIGHT.

27:57.458 --> 28:00.250
HEY, YOU WANT
TO COME WITH ME
TO THE ICE HOUSE?

28:00.250 --> 28:01.792
I TOLD BESSIE
I'D HELP CLEAN UP.

28:01.792 --> 28:04.875
UH, NO. I'VE GOT--

28:04.875 --> 28:07.708
I GOT TO STAY HERE
AND FINISH MY PROJECT
WITH JEN.

28:07.708 --> 28:09.125
AH.

28:09.125 --> 28:10.458
MINE'S DONE.

28:10.458 --> 28:12.000
I HATE YOU.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.291
YEAH?

28:13.291 --> 28:14.834
WELL, ACTUALLY,

28:14.834 --> 28:16.625
LAURA
PRACTICALLY DID
THE WHOLE THING.

28:16.625 --> 28:18.208
SHE'S SO COOL,
DAWSON.

28:18.208 --> 28:20.458
I MEAN, SHE SAID
ANYTIME I WANT TO
INTERNET HER COMPANY

28:20.458 --> 28:22.375
SHE'D HOOK ME UP.
REALLY?

28:22.375 --> 28:24.542
UH-HUH.
SHE JUST KIND OF
MADE ME REALIZE

28:24.542 --> 28:27.500
THAT MAYBE SOMEDAY
I COULD OWN
MY OWN BUSINESS

28:27.500 --> 28:29.667
OR RUN
MY OWN COMPANY.

28:29.667 --> 28:31.166
IT WAS COOL.

28:31.166 --> 28:32.542
SEE? LOOKS LIKE JOEY

28:32.542 --> 28:34.750
HAS SOME
CAREER ASPIRATIONS
AFTER ALL.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.917
UM,
IF YOUR FATHER
COMES BACK,

28:40.917 --> 28:43.583
TELL HIM
THAT SINCE IT'S
THURSDAY NIGHT,

28:43.583 --> 28:45.250
I'VE GONE OUT.

28:46.667 --> 28:47.875
WHEN WILL YOU BE BACK?

28:47.875 --> 28:49.917
LATER.

28:49.917 --> 28:51.375
GOOD NIGHT,
HONEY.

28:51.375 --> 28:54.750
GOOD NIGHT.

28:54.750 --> 28:57.083
I HAVE GIVEN UP
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
MY PARENTS.

28:57.083 --> 28:59.375
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST--HA!

28:59.375 --> 29:01.542
THINGS ARE
REALLY WEIRD RIGHT NOW.

29:05.750 --> 29:07.708
DO YOU THINK
MAYBE WE SHOULD
TAKE ADVANTAGE

29:07.708 --> 29:09.959
OF THIS MOMENTARY
LACK OF SUPERVISION?

29:19.417 --> 29:20.750
HEY.

29:22.083 --> 29:23.250
HEY.

29:23.250 --> 29:25.083
IF I'VE INTERRUPTED
SOMETHING,

29:25.083 --> 29:26.417
I CAN COME BACK
LATER.

29:26.417 --> 29:29.125
NO. ACTUALLY, I
WAS JUST LEAVING.

29:29.125 --> 29:30.166
BYE, DAWSON.

29:30.166 --> 29:31.583
GOOD-BYE.

29:35.583 --> 29:36.750
NICE DRESS.

29:36.750 --> 29:38.208
THANKS.
I BORROWED IT.

29:38.208 --> 29:39.917
I BET.

29:44.166 --> 29:45.458
SO, UM,

29:45.458 --> 29:47.291
WHERE DO YOU WANT
TO DO THIS?

29:47.291 --> 29:50.250
SOMEWHERE WHERE WE
CAN BE COMFORTABLE.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.750
LET'S GO
TO YOUR BEDROOM.

29:54.625 --> 29:56.125
WHY DO WE NEED
2 RANGE ROVERS?

29:56.125 --> 29:57.458
COMPROMISE, JEFF.

29:57.458 --> 29:59.166
A COUPLE OF WEEKS
IN EUROPE,

29:59.166 --> 30:00.125
DRIVE A CHEAPER CAR.

30:00.125 --> 30:01.458
HUH! FINE.

30:01.458 --> 30:02.625
YOU WANT
THE HONEYMOON,

30:02.625 --> 30:04.125
YOU DRIVE
THE CHEAPER CAR, OK?

30:04.125 --> 30:05.542
OH, MAN.

30:05.542 --> 30:07.417
YOU'RE SO SELFISH.
WHY DO YOU ACT LIKE THAT?

30:07.417 --> 30:09.458
YEAH, I'M SELFISH!
YOU ALWAYS ACT LIKE THAT.

30:09.458 --> 30:11.667
YEAH. YEAH,
QUIT IT.

30:11.667 --> 30:13.667
HEY, SORRY I'M LATE.

30:13.667 --> 30:15.291
GOD, THIS PLACE
IS A PIGSTY.

30:15.291 --> 30:17.250
WE GOT SLAMMED.

30:17.250 --> 30:20.291
MMM. HEY, BESSIE,
I WAS TELLING LAURA ABOUT
OUR FINANCIAL PROBLEMS--

30:20.291 --> 30:22.166
WHO'S LAURA?

30:22.166 --> 30:24.959
WELL, SHE'S THE INTERIOR
DESIGNER WHO HELPED ME
WITH MY PROJECT.

30:24.959 --> 30:27.959
OH, RIGHT, THE SUPER-
SUCCESSFUL CAREER WOMAN.

30:27.959 --> 30:29.959
ANYWAY, SHE HAD SOME
REALLY GOOD IDEAS,

30:29.959 --> 30:31.583
I MEAN, WAYS TO KEEP
OUR OVERHEAD COSTS DOWN.

30:31.583 --> 30:33.458
AND LAURA ALSO SAID

30:33.458 --> 30:35.500
SHE COULD HELP US
DESIGN A NEW LOGO
FOR THE ICE HOUSE.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.500
I MEAN, WE COULD
PRINT NEW MENUS,
PLACE MATS.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.000
WE DON'T NEED NEW MENUS
OR PLACE MATS.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.792
SHE SAID SHE
COULD DO IT FOR FREE.

30:40.792 --> 30:43.333
SAID IT'S CRUCIAL
FOR BUSINESSES TO REVAMP
EVERY SO OFTEN.

30:43.333 --> 30:45.291
IT KEEPS THINGS FRESH.

30:45.291 --> 30:47.625
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO LISTEN TO ADVICE
FROM SOME WOMAN

30:47.625 --> 30:49.792
THAT KNOWS NOTHING
ABOUT ME OR MY LIFE
OR THE ICE HOUSE.

30:49.792 --> 30:52.166
LOOK, SHE'S
JUST TRYING TO HELP.

30:52.166 --> 30:53.959
I DON'T NEED HER HELP.
I NEED YOUR HELP NOW.

30:53.959 --> 30:55.291
HEALTH DEPARTMENT
CALLED.

30:55.291 --> 30:57.792
THEY'RE COMING TOMORROW
TO DO THE INSPECTION,

30:57.792 --> 30:59.208
THIS PLACE
IS A TOTAL DISASTER.

30:59.208 --> 31:01.166
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SNAP
AT ME LIKE IT'S MY FAULT.

31:01.166 --> 31:03.291
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
COMING IN EARLIER.
WE NEEDED YOU.

31:03.291 --> 31:05.208
I'M SORRY, BESSIE.
I ACTUALLY HAVE A LIFE.

31:05.208 --> 31:06.625
I AM NOT YOUR
FULL-TIME SLAVE.

31:06.625 --> 31:09.333
THAT'S A BIT OF
AN EXAGGERATION.

31:09.333 --> 31:12.166
I FEEL LIKE ALL
I EVER DO IS RUN YOUR ERRANDS,
ANSWER YOUR PHONE CALLS,

31:12.166 --> 31:14.041
TAKE CARE OF YOUR BABY,
AND I'M SICK OF IT.

31:14.041 --> 31:15.875
HEY, WHERE
SHOULD I PUT--

31:15.875 --> 31:18.667
JOEY, I'M REALLY
SORRY MY BABY AND I
ARE CRAMPING YOUR STYLE.

31:18.667 --> 31:19.834
WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME?

31:19.834 --> 31:21.792
JACK AND I
HAVE IT COVERED.

31:39.542 --> 31:41.875
HEY,
WE'RE CLOSED.

31:41.875 --> 31:44.917
LISTEN, COULD I JUST
GET A CUP OF COFFEE, MAN?
I'M DESPERATE.

31:44.917 --> 31:47.166
YEAH. YEAH, SURE.

31:47.166 --> 31:48.708
YOU'RE ANDI'S
BROTHER, RIGHT?

31:48.708 --> 31:50.375
I'M PACEY.

31:50.375 --> 31:53.041
YEAH, I KNOW
WHO YOU ARE.

31:53.041 --> 31:56.041
UH, LISTEN, IS YOUR SISTER
ON ANY MEDICATION?

31:56.041 --> 31:57.875
'CAUSE SHE JUST WENT
COMPLETELY BALLISTIC ON ME.

31:57.875 --> 31:59.208
WHY? WHAT'D YOU
DO TO HER?

31:59.208 --> 32:02.875
NOTHING. I JUST CALLED
HER A SPOILED PRINCESS,
SHE GOES PSYCHO.

32:02.875 --> 32:04.750
I GUESS
THE TRUTH HURTS SOMETIMES.

32:04.750 --> 32:06.417
ANDI A SPOILED
PRINCESS,

32:06.417 --> 32:08.708
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING
COULD BE FURTHER FROM
THE TRUTH.

32:08.708 --> 32:12.583
OH, COME ON, DON'T TRY
AND TELL ME YOUR FAMILY'S
NOT TOTALLY LOADED?

32:12.583 --> 32:15.875
YOU THINK I'M
WORKING HERE FOR KICKS?

32:15.875 --> 32:18.875
YEAH, BUT YOUR SISTER
DRIVES A SAAB, MAN, AND
ALL THOSE NICE CLOTHES.

32:18.875 --> 32:22.083
WELL, IT'S
THE LAST REMAINS OF
A DECAYING DYNASTY.

32:22.083 --> 32:24.542
I DON'T GET IT.

32:24.542 --> 32:28.375
LOOK, THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN THINGS WERE--
WERE EASY FOR US,

32:28.375 --> 32:31.417
I MEAN, RELATIVELY,
BUT THOSE DAYS
ARE OVER NOW.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.166
LOOK, I REALLY DON'T
WANT TO GET INTO THIS.

32:33.166 --> 32:35.834
UH, JUST DO ME A FAVOR.

32:35.834 --> 32:39.250
GIVE ANDI A BREAK,
YOU KNOW. SHE--
SHE DESERVES IT.

33:05.250 --> 33:06.834
HOW ARE YOU?

33:06.834 --> 33:08.000
WHAT'S UP,
YOU GUYS?

33:13.250 --> 33:15.792
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

33:37.500 --> 33:39.333
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE DONE.

33:39.333 --> 33:41.041
WHEW!

33:41.041 --> 33:42.458
FINALLY, HUH?

33:42.458 --> 33:43.875
AHH.

33:45.667 --> 33:47.458
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.708
OH, MY GOD,
I AM SO EXHAUSTED.

33:54.708 --> 33:57.333
I CAN BARELY
EVEN SEE STRAIGHT.

33:57.333 --> 33:59.708
YEAH, I FEEL LIKE I'VE
BECOME ONE WITH THIS CHAIR.

34:04.917 --> 34:09.708
HOW ABOUT A MASSAGE?
GET RID OF A LITTLE BIT
OF THAT TENSION, HMM?

34:09.708 --> 34:12.917
UM, I'M--I'M COOL.

34:15.208 --> 34:17.500
ARE YOU SURE?

34:17.500 --> 34:18.917
YEP.

34:22.875 --> 34:25.750
GOD, I AM SO BEAT.

34:28.875 --> 34:34.041
UH, I DON'T THINK I CAN
EVEN MAKE IT NEXT DOOR.

34:34.041 --> 34:36.375
DO YOU MIND IF
I JUST CRASH HERE
FOR THE NIGHT?

34:40.542 --> 34:43.291
ACTUALLY, YEAH, I DO.

34:43.291 --> 34:45.333
WHAT?

34:45.333 --> 34:47.917
YEAH, I DO MIND.

34:47.917 --> 34:51.083
I THINK YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY GO HOME.

34:51.083 --> 34:52.958
WHAT?

34:52.958 --> 34:57.166
OH, WHAT, SO--SO WE
CAN'T HANG OUT TOGETHER
ANYMORE, IS THAT IT?

34:57.166 --> 34:59.083
NO, ABSOLUTELY
WE CAN HANG OUT TOGETHER,

34:59.083 --> 35:00.792
WE JUST CAN'T
SLEEP TOGETHER.

35:00.792 --> 35:02.583
OH, CALM DOWN, DAWSON.

35:02.583 --> 35:05.041
GOD, I WAS JUST ASKING
IF I COULD CRASH
AT YOUR HOUSE.

35:05.041 --> 35:07.083
NOBODY SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT SLEEPING TOGETHER.

35:10.875 --> 35:12.750
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

35:14.333 --> 35:15.708
IT'S JOEY, ISN'T IT?

35:15.708 --> 35:18.583
SHE'S BEEN PUTTING IDEAS
IN YOUR HEAD ABOUT ME.

35:18.583 --> 35:20.750
NO, JEN, JOEY IS
NOT PUTTING ANY IDEAS
IN MY HEAD ABOUT YOU.

35:20.750 --> 35:21.917
I'M NOT OBLIVIOUS.

35:21.917 --> 35:23.291
MEANING?

35:23.291 --> 35:27.417
WELL, MEANING,
LOOK AT YOU.

35:27.417 --> 35:31.625
IS THIS WHAT YOU NORMALLY
WEAR TO A STUDY SESSION?

35:31.625 --> 35:34.291
YOU'VE BEEN MAKING
SUGGESTIVE COMMENTS AND
TOUCHING ME ALL NIGHT.

35:34.291 --> 35:35.959
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO BE--

35:35.959 --> 35:38.583
IF YOU CAN'T
HANDLE BEING IN THE SAME
ROOM WITH ME--

35:38.583 --> 35:40.667
OK, LOOK, I CAN HANDLE
BEING IN THE SAME
ROOM WITH YOU.

35:40.667 --> 35:43.291
I CAN'T HANDLE
YOU THROWING YOURSELF
AT ME EVERY SECOND.

35:43.291 --> 35:45.625
I MEAN, DON'T YOU
FIND IT HUMILIATING?

35:45.625 --> 35:48.041
I'M NOT HUMILIATING
ANYBODY, DAWSON.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.542
AND I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE WITH JOEY,
AND I ACCEPT THAT.

35:54.667 --> 35:56.583
I JUST DON'T RESPECT IT.

35:56.583 --> 36:00.125
AND I DON'T MEAN THIS IN
A SLUTTY, SELF-DEGRADING
SORT OF WAY,

36:00.125 --> 36:03.792
BUT I WANT TO
LET YOU KNOW THAT
YOU'VE GOT OPTIONS,

36:03.792 --> 36:05.750
AND I'M ONE OF THEM.

36:09.458 --> 36:10.792
WHO ARE YOU?

36:10.792 --> 36:13.000
WHAT HAPPENED TO JEN?

36:15.500 --> 36:18.542
SHE GOT BORED.
SHE DECIDED TO LIVEN
THINGS UP A BIT.

36:35.333 --> 36:37.083
I HOPE YOU CAN
HANDLE IT, DAWSON.

37:02.166 --> 37:03.875
HAVE FUN?

37:03.875 --> 37:06.291
YEAH. DID YOU?

37:06.291 --> 37:08.583
YEAH.

37:08.583 --> 37:10.542
GOOD.

37:10.542 --> 37:13.041
GOOD.

37:13.041 --> 37:16.000
SO, WHAT'D YOU DO?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.375
I WENT TO DUKE'S,

37:18.375 --> 37:20.375
MET SOME NEW PEOPLE,

37:20.375 --> 37:23.458
HUNG OUT,
DANCED A LITTLE.

37:23.458 --> 37:24.875
YOU?

37:24.875 --> 37:28.041
OH, I, UH, MET
A FRIEND FOR SOME DRINKS.

37:28.041 --> 37:31.208
IT WAS FUN.

37:31.208 --> 37:34.125
I'M GLAD YOU HAD
A GOOD TIME TONIGHT, MITCH.

38:13.375 --> 38:16.792
I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK
YOU HAD SKIPPED TOWN
ON ME.

38:16.792 --> 38:19.583
NO, I WAS UP
ALL NIGHT CLEANING.

38:19.583 --> 38:22.166
LOOK, JOEY, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

38:22.166 --> 38:26.166
THINGS AREN'T WORKING OUT
FOR YOU IN THE ICE HOUSE,
SO YOU'RE FIRED.

38:27.625 --> 38:29.458
FIRED?

38:29.458 --> 38:32.000
I JUST DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE WORKING
THERE ANYMORE, SO--

38:32.000 --> 38:33.625
YOU CAN'T FIRE ME.

38:33.625 --> 38:35.625
YES, I CAN, AND I AM.

38:35.625 --> 38:39.125
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING, BESSIE.

38:39.125 --> 38:41.500
I COULDN'T SLEEP LAST NIGHT.
I FELT SO BAD. I--

38:41.500 --> 38:43.750
THOSE THINGS THAT I SAID,
I DIDN'T MEAN THEM.

38:43.750 --> 38:45.542
YES, YOU DID.

38:46.959 --> 38:48.583
AND, JOEY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

38:48.583 --> 38:51.583
I'M--I'M IN
WAY OVER MY HEAD.

38:51.583 --> 38:53.583
I LIVE IN TOTAL CHAOS.

38:53.583 --> 38:55.750
BUT THESE PROBLEMS,
THEY'RE NOT YOURS.

38:55.750 --> 38:59.291
I DON'T WANT TO BE
THE ONE ROBBING YOU
OF YOUR CHILDHOOD.

38:59.291 --> 39:01.500
YOU SHOULD BE OUT
HAVING FUN AND BEING YOUNG,

39:01.500 --> 39:04.792
NOT BURDENED
BY ALL MY MESSES.

39:04.792 --> 39:08.250
IT'S NOT FAIR.

39:08.250 --> 39:11.625
IT'S NOT FAIR TO YOU,
AND I'M SORRY.

39:11.625 --> 39:13.625
BESSIE...

39:13.625 --> 39:15.583
THESE ARE MY PROBLEMS.

39:17.208 --> 39:20.500
YOU SEE, YOU AND I
ARE A TEAM, YOU KNOW?

39:20.500 --> 39:23.625
AND YOU CAN'T FIRE ME,

39:23.625 --> 39:26.708
'CAUSE I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE AND I WON'T
BE FIRED.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.792
AND I LOVE YOU...

39:35.000 --> 39:38.250
AND ALEXANDER.

39:38.250 --> 39:40.792
AND I DON'T EVER WANT
YOU TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
IN THIS ALONE.

39:42.542 --> 39:45.250
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
MY LITTLE SISTER.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.917
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
TAKING CARE OF YOU.

39:46.917 --> 39:49.291
YOU DO.

39:49.291 --> 39:51.542
GOD, YOU DO TAKE
CARE OF ME, BESSIE.

39:53.667 --> 39:55.250
YOU KNOW, ONE DAY,

39:55.250 --> 39:58.291
I'LL GET IT TOGETHER,
AND YOU'LL BE PROUD OF ME.

39:59.208 --> 40:03.333
I AM PROUD OF YOU,
BESSIE.

40:03.333 --> 40:06.417
I MEAN, THIS ASSIGNMENT
MADE ME REALIZE HOW MUCH
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH

40:06.417 --> 40:09.000
AND HOW MUCH STRESS
YOU ARE UNDER AND...

40:10.834 --> 40:12.375
I THINK YOU ARE AMAZING.

40:12.375 --> 40:14.375
YEAH?

40:14.375 --> 40:16.000
YEAH...

40:16.000 --> 40:17.291
A LITTLE.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.500
UNLIKE SOME OF
YOUR SCHOOLWORK,

40:28.500 --> 40:31.500
THE LESSONS THAT YOU
LEARNED FROM THIS PROJECT

40:31.500 --> 40:34.250
CAN BE DIRECTLY APPLIED
TO YOUR FUTURE LIFE.

40:34.250 --> 40:38.500
AND THEREFORE,
I HOPE, I HOPE

40:38.500 --> 40:43.458
THAT YOU GAVE THIS PROJECT
ITS DESERVED ATTENTION.

40:43.458 --> 40:46.667
NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE PASS
YOUR PROJECTS TO THE FRONT
OF THE ROOM FOR ME?

40:49.542 --> 40:52.542
OH, UH, JEFF, HOW'D
THAT WEDDING TURN OUT?

40:52.542 --> 40:55.250
GREAT, MR. MADDOCK.
WE DECIDED FOR A CASUAL
ONE BY THE OCEAN,

40:55.250 --> 40:56.875
YOU KNOW, JUST, UH,

40:56.875 --> 40:58.875
Together: CLOSE FRIENDS
AND FAMILY.

40:58.875 --> 41:00.583
THAT WAY
WE COULD SPEND MORE
ON THE HONEYMOON.

41:00.583 --> 41:01.708
GOOD DECISION, TREY.

41:01.708 --> 41:02.792
MR. MADDOCK?

41:02.792 --> 41:04.458
FYI--

41:04.458 --> 41:06.583
ABBY MORGAN'S NAME
IS ON THIS REPORT

41:06.583 --> 41:08.458
BECAUSE SHE
THREATENED MY LIFE,

41:08.458 --> 41:10.291
BUT SHE DIDN'T
HELP AT ALL,

41:10.291 --> 41:13.083
AND SHE SPENT
THE ENTIRE WEEK JUST
VERBALLY ABUSING ME.

41:13.083 --> 41:14.792
THAT IS A LIE.

41:14.792 --> 41:18.500
MR. MADDOCK, LOOK,
KENNY WAS CONGESTED,

41:18.500 --> 41:21.458
AND HE LITERALLY HAD
SNOT ALL OVER HIS FACE.

41:21.458 --> 41:23.500
I JUST DIDN'T
WANT TO GET ILL.

41:23.500 --> 41:25.125
WELL, I JUST HOPE
THAT IN YOUR BUDGET

41:25.125 --> 41:27.458
YOU TWO ALLOCATED MONEY
FOR MARRIAGE COUNSELING.

41:27.458 --> 41:31.125
SO, ANDI,
WHERE'S YOUR PROJECT?

41:31.125 --> 41:33.458
WELL, MR. MADDOCK,

41:33.458 --> 41:37.125
SINCE MARRIAGE IS
A 50/50 PARTNERSHIP,

41:37.125 --> 41:41.125
I DECIDED TO DO
MY PROJECT FROM THE
WIFE'S PERSPECTIVE.

41:41.125 --> 41:44.000
SO HERE'S MY HALF.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.667
[DOOR OPENS]

41:46.667 --> 41:48.458
Mr. Maddock:
PACEY WITTER,

41:48.458 --> 41:50.000
THANK YOU
FOR JOINING US.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.333
IS THIS YOUR PROJECT?

41:51.333 --> 41:52.500
MINE AND ANDI'S.

41:52.500 --> 41:54.166
WOW!

41:54.166 --> 41:56.166
LOOKS PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE.

41:56.166 --> 41:57.834
HA! GOOD WORK, YOU TWO.

41:57.834 --> 41:59.834
AND NOW THAT
THIS IS OVER,

41:59.834 --> 42:02.166
YOU'LL GET THESE
BACK ON MONDAY.

42:02.166 --> 42:05.917
THEN MONDAY, WE'RE
GONNA START OUR PROJECT
ON MACROECONOMICS.

42:09.333 --> 42:12.542
AH, I'M SO GLAD
THAT PROJECT IS OVER.

42:12.542 --> 42:14.417
I KINDA LIKED
THE ASSIGNMENT.

42:14.417 --> 42:15.875
YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?

42:15.875 --> 42:17.166
YEAH.

42:17.166 --> 42:18.708
I COULD
JUST SEE YOU NOW.

42:18.708 --> 42:20.792
"JOEY POTTER
CLIMBS THE LADDER
OF CORPORATE AMERICA."

42:20.792 --> 42:22.500
SHUT UP.

42:22.500 --> 42:23.708
COME HERE.

42:28.208 --> 42:30.291
GET A ROOM.

42:32.708 --> 42:34.708
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

42:34.708 --> 42:36.333
I HAVE NO IDEA.

42:37.917 --> 42:39.667
PACEY, HEY!

42:39.667 --> 42:40.875
HEY.

42:40.875 --> 42:43.417
THANKS FOR FINISHING
THE PROJECT.

42:43.417 --> 42:45.875
I GUESS I CAN NEVER
CALL YOU LAZY AGAIN.

42:45.875 --> 42:49.333
LISTEN, UH, I'M SORRY
ABOUT YESTERDAY, OK?

42:49.333 --> 42:52.959
I THINK WE WERE BOTH
SUFFERING FROM A CASE
OF FALSE IMPRESSIONS.

42:52.959 --> 42:56.000
I TALKED TO YOUR
BROTHER LAST NIGHT,
AND HE EXPLAINED TO ME

42:56.000 --> 42:57.708
THAT YOUR FAMILY'S
NOT EXACTLY
THE ROCKEFELLERS.

42:57.708 --> 42:59.542
HE DID?

42:59.542 --> 43:04.000
YEAH. SO I FEEL
LIKE THE WORLD'S
BIGGEST CHUMP.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.583
MMM, DON'T SWEAT IT.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.959
NO, UH, YOU WERE RIGHT,
IT'S TRUE.

43:07.959 --> 43:10.125
I OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

43:10.125 --> 43:12.417
PACEY...

43:12.417 --> 43:15.125
MY LIFE IS LIKE
A MOVIE OF THE WEEK

43:15.125 --> 43:17.583
THAT'S PROBABLY BETTER
LEFT OUT OF THIS BRIEF
LITTLE TRUCE

43:17.583 --> 43:19.375
WE HAVE GOING HERE, OK?

43:19.375 --> 43:20.750
SURE.

43:20.750 --> 43:23.834
SO WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS,
DID WE GET THE VIPER?

43:23.834 --> 43:26.542
COME ON, AFTER ALL
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

43:26.542 --> 43:28.875
COULD I REALLY
GET THE VIPER?

43:28.875 --> 43:31.542
OK, I HAD TO. IT'S
SUCH AN AWESOME CAR.

43:31.542 --> 43:34.125
BUT THAT MEANS
ALL OF OUR KIDS

43:34.125 --> 43:36.708
ARE STUFFED INTO
A 2-BEDROOM APARTMENT.

43:36.708 --> 43:39.208
AH, ACTUALLY, IT'S
A ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT.
BUT, YOU KNOW,

43:39.208 --> 43:41.375
THE FAMILY THAT
LAYS TOGETHER,
STAYS TOGETHER.

43:41.375 --> 43:43.375
PACEY, 5 PEOPLE
IN ONE BEDROOM?

43:43.375 --> 43:45.375
THAT IS INSANITY.

43:45.375 --> 43:47.000
ARE YOU COMPLAINING?

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT
DOING THAT PROJECT,

43:49.000 --> 43:50.625
AND NOW YOU'RE
COMPLAINING?

43:50.625 --> 43:52.500
I MEAN, THAT JUST
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

43:52.500 --> 43:54.125
Andi:
HOW CAN I COMPLAIN?

43:54.125 --> 43:56.458
BECAUSE THERE
ARE SO MANY THINGS
WRONG WITH THAT REPORT.

43:56.458 --> 43:58.083
WRONG
WITH THAT REPORT?

43:58.083 --> 43:59.834
KNOW WHAT?
FAMILY UNITY IS
IMPORTANT TO ME.

43:59.834 --> 44:01.291
I BELIEVE
THAT FAMILY--

44:01.291 --> 44:03.291
Andi: AT THE EXPENSE
OF--NO, NO.
