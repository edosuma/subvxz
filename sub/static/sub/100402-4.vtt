WEBVTT

02:00.703 --> 02:02.163
I'm happy you stayed tonight.

02:03.998 --> 02:05.250
I'm happy I stayed too.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.877
I wish we didn't have to sneak around.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.379
Me too.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.298
But you know how my dad is.

02:13.466 --> 02:16.469
He would legit murder me
if he found out I wasn't in my room.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.722
But guess what?

02:19.806 --> 02:22.600
He's going to Las Vegas
for a church convention.

02:22.684 --> 02:23.726
For real?

02:23.810 --> 02:25.311
For an entire week.

02:25.395 --> 02:30.984
Which means we could spend
the whole night together...

02:32.694 --> 02:33.862
at my house.

02:36.072 --> 02:37.031
I think we're ready.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.169
But for now,

02:51.171 --> 02:52.213
I gotta go.

02:52.630 --> 02:53.548
Okay.

02:54.841 --> 02:55.800
Okay.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.146
-Yes.

03:40.678 --> 03:42.013
Good morning.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.266
Sabrina.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.436
What are you, uh...
what are you doing here?

03:48.519 --> 03:51.522
Astral projecting.
So I'm only here in spirit.

03:51.940 --> 03:52.815
Oh.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.150
Speaking of spirit...

03:55.944 --> 03:57.654
what do you think of my outfit?

03:57.737 --> 04:00.615
Give me an H, give me an O, give me a T.

04:01.032 --> 04:04.327
So, there's this cheerleader performance
flash mob thing

04:04.410 --> 04:07.038
happening today at Baxter High.
Wanna come?

04:08.039 --> 04:09.958
I may have bragged to all the girls

04:10.041 --> 04:12.627
about my dark,
dashing private school boyfriend.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.506
Then I shall be there.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.092
Amazing. See you then.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.614
Quite a racket you and your friends
have been making in the garage.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.158
It's called music, Dad.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.118
Oh.

04:45.785 --> 04:46.995
Morning.

04:48.746 --> 04:49.872
Morning.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.924
Um... what are you doing here?

05:00.008 --> 05:02.176
Your father and I met last night
at the carnival.

05:03.344 --> 05:04.721
I gotta get to the mines.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.935
See you later, babe.

05:11.019 --> 05:11.978
Bye, lover.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.525
Are you wearing my mom's robe?

05:18.443 --> 05:19.944
Want me to take it off?

05:25.074 --> 05:26.284
Definitely not.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.203
Oh, don't get so high and mighty.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.040
Your father and I are both adults,

05:32.707 --> 05:35.043
which is more than I can say for you.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.463
Does your dad know what you've been up to?

05:40.423 --> 05:43.176
-Maybe I should tell him.
-Maybe you should mind your own business.

05:53.227 --> 05:54.812
-Morning, lamb.
- Good morning.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.147
What's that smell?

05:56.230 --> 05:57.065
-Pancakes?
-No.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.734
Making your favorite, moon pie,
for the lunar festivities.

05:59.817 --> 06:03.446
Wait, we're not still celebrating
the Hare Moon, are we?

06:03.529 --> 06:04.655
And why shouldn't we?

06:04.739 --> 06:07.158
Well, aren't we in crisis
with our powers waning?

06:07.241 --> 06:08.993
Also, it's not even a real holiday.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.288
It's just an excuse to eat pie
and drink wine at a picnic.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.541
I mean, it's a symbolic gesture
giving thanks to a bunch of rabbits.

06:15.625 --> 06:16.459
True.

06:17.168 --> 06:21.047
But it will give the coven
a moment of reprieve, of levity.

06:21.130 --> 06:24.801
Our vernal homage to rebirth
will be a morale boost,

06:24.884 --> 06:27.887
and at the very least,
a distraction from our waning powers.

06:27.970 --> 06:31.474
Okay. Well, I have a cheer event,
which you're both welcome to attend.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.142
-Lovely.
-We'll be far too busy...

06:33.226 --> 06:35.728
-Far too busy getting ready.
-...getting ready, as should you be.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.481
You are our coven's
youngest living member, Sabrina,

06:38.564 --> 06:41.818
which means you are our symbolic hare
and must walk into the woods

06:41.901 --> 06:44.362
and release the pardoned rabbit
whilst singing a song of summer.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.240
Okay, but it makes zero sense.

06:47.740 --> 06:51.702
I mean, during Feast of Feasts,
we literally cannibalize a witch.

06:51.786 --> 06:54.997
So during the Hare Moon,
we release a rabbit.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.124
How does that track?

06:56.207 --> 06:58.209
It is not the time to question traditions.

06:58.292 --> 06:59.127
No.

06:59.377 --> 07:00.670
So we'll see you at 3:00.

07:01.295 --> 07:05.341
Earlier, if Ambrose's research
yields a reason for our chronic weakness.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.516
Ms. Wardwell?

07:17.103 --> 07:18.187
Yes.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.356
I hope you'll pardon the intrusion,
Ms. Wardwell,

07:20.440 --> 07:24.652
but I wanted to thank you again in person
for helping my family.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.988
Little Lucy is fine, thank goodness.

07:27.071 --> 07:27.905
Huh!

07:28.406 --> 07:29.866
Uh... well, I...

07:31.242 --> 07:32.368
I'm not sure I follow.

07:32.869 --> 07:37.123
My daughter. All she remembers
from the incident is eating ice cream,

07:37.623 --> 07:39.375
and then you coming to her rescue.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.335
Yeah, I have...

07:41.794 --> 07:42.712
I really d...

07:43.171 --> 07:45.548
I have no id...
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:45.631 --> 07:49.177
You found Lucy in an ice cream freezer
and returned her to me.

07:50.595 --> 07:53.097
The police are still looking
for her abductor.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.725
Have they been by yet
to take a statement from you?

07:56.058 --> 07:57.602
Uh, not yet.

07:58.519 --> 08:05.109
Perhaps if you were to tell me exactly
what it is I did to help your...

08:06.777 --> 08:08.321
your daughter, was it?

08:09.155 --> 08:12.074
Hey, girl, where's Nick?
I thought he was coming to the flash mob.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.452
Yeah, he is. Let me double-check.

08:25.546 --> 08:28.508
<i>♪ Don't worry 'bout this heart of mine ♪</i>

08:29.300 --> 08:32.553
<i>♪ It's been busted for a long, long time ♪</i>

08:32.637 --> 08:36.098
<i>♪ You'll only find static on the line ♪</i>

08:36.766 --> 08:38.226
Son of an angel.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.485
<i>Anyway, it's so gross.</i>

08:47.568 --> 08:49.987
My dad just met her at the carnival,
like, last night.

08:50.488 --> 08:53.533
-There's something super weird about her.
<i>-</i>Wait, who is this again?

08:53.616 --> 08:54.867
The snake charmer lady.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.285
Let's go investigate.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.747
We could go snooping around the tents,
maybe we'll see something.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.667
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.460
-Let's do it.
-I'm in.

09:04.544 --> 09:10.299
I have a picnic type thing with my aunts,
but please be careful, guys.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.802
-Robin, you want to join?
-Uh...

09:13.177 --> 09:16.222
No, I'll, uh... I'll sit this one out.

09:16.305 --> 09:17.348
Oh.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.350
Isn't this a lovely little picture.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.269
-Aunt Hilda?
-Hi.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.648
-Are you astral projecting right now?
-Oh, no, tried to, couldn't, drove.

09:25.898 --> 09:26.983
What's going on?

09:27.441 --> 09:29.610
Your Aunt Zelda wants us to go
straight to the Academy.

09:30.027 --> 09:31.904
Emergency family meeting.

09:32.321 --> 09:34.073
Attendance is mandatory.

09:35.032 --> 09:38.119
Go, I'll cover for you
with the Ravenettes.

09:38.202 --> 09:39.412
What do we do if Nick shows up?

09:39.495 --> 09:42.957
Just tell him I'm at the Academy,
which is probably where he is.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.711
You're not going to like this, but...

09:47.545 --> 09:50.381
it is our fault the coven's powers
are waxing and waning.

09:50.464 --> 09:54.510
Lookie here. So the Pendle Coven suffered
a similar power loss in 1612.

09:54.594 --> 09:58.180
It seems they offended the Dark Lord
in some way,

09:58.264 --> 10:02.935
and so he withdrew his gifts from them
a little at a time and then all at once.

10:04.895 --> 10:08.899
They offended him, and we...
we dethroned and imprisoned him.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.901
Well, how did they get their power back?

10:11.652 --> 10:12.570
They didn't.

10:14.238 --> 10:17.033
The Pendle Coven was wiped out
by witch hunters several months later.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.076
What does that mean for us?

10:19.160 --> 10:21.412
It means the Dark Lord is a sore loser,

10:21.495 --> 10:23.914
and he's cut us off
like the petulant brat he is.

10:34.425 --> 10:39.722
Are you really so petty
you'd render our entire coven powerless,

10:39.805 --> 10:42.266
vulnerable, out of spite?

10:42.350 --> 10:45.728
I wondered how long it would take you all
to realize the price you'd pay

10:45.811 --> 10:46.812
for imprisoning me.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.440
I demand that you restore our power
at once.

10:50.066 --> 10:55.363
If you want your power back,
all you have to do is set me free.

10:56.447 --> 10:57.615
That we shall never do.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.743
Oh, then let's see how long you all last
without my protection.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.248
Unless, of course, you beseech Lilith.

11:07.041 --> 11:11.545
Perhaps she could bless
your pathetic coven with her gifts.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.464
Oh, that's right, she can't!

11:14.340 --> 11:16.050
Why, she's not even Queen of Hell.

11:16.133 --> 11:17.635
That's enough, Dark Lord.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.970
What do you mean,
Lilith's not Queen of Hell?

11:20.054 --> 11:21.097
Of course she is.

11:21.180 --> 11:24.266
Will you tell them, daughter, or shall I?

11:33.693 --> 11:35.611
-Aunt Zee, don't be mad.
-Upstairs.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.654
Now!

11:47.039 --> 11:48.916
Queen? Queen of Hell?

11:49.333 --> 11:51.043
Explain yourself, Your Highness.

11:51.127 --> 11:54.547
I don't precisely have
the throne outright just yet.

11:54.630 --> 11:55.923
But you're Queen?

11:56.006 --> 11:59.051
My claim to the throne has been
challenged by a prince of Hell,

11:59.135 --> 12:01.220
this surfer dude named Caliban.

12:01.303 --> 12:03.597
Being Queen of Hell isn't a summer job.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.099
You're 16, for pity's sake.

12:05.182 --> 12:07.309
You're not dedicating the rest
of your life to a kingdom

12:07.393 --> 12:09.145
that has nothing whatsoever
to do with you!

12:09.228 --> 12:12.064
It was my father's kingdom,
Aunt Zelda, before we trapped him.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.941
And it's not like I had a choice.

12:14.442 --> 12:17.278
I did it to save the realms.
There's a balance.

12:17.361 --> 12:22.283
You did it because you wanted to!
You did it because you like power!

12:22.366 --> 12:24.660
And that's healthy, up to a point,

12:24.744 --> 12:27.079
but you... you have a savior complex.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.456
You always have.

12:28.873 --> 12:29.957
Can you believe this, Hilda?

12:30.040 --> 12:34.336
Your niece chose a throne in Hell
over her coven and her family.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.921
-She did not.
-That's not fair.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.132
I have always stood with you
and the coven.

12:38.215 --> 12:41.594
Have you lifted one finger to help us,
even as we find ourselves coming apart?

12:41.677 --> 12:42.720
Speaking of that,

12:42.803 --> 12:45.264
we have an urgent, urgent problem
on our hands.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.933
We are witches, and the Dark Lord
has rendered us powerless.

12:48.017 --> 12:51.353
We need a new source
of mystical energy now.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.105
On the eve of the Hare Moon.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.399
Right, what shall we tell the students?

12:55.483 --> 12:57.401
-Nothing, of course.
-Nothing.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.445
This is a problem we four must solve.

12:59.528 --> 13:00.571
I have an idea.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.532
I'm Queen of Hell, as we all now know.

13:03.616 --> 13:07.828
I should have access to the same energies
that Lucifer did-- does.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.122
The Dark Lord's power is infernal.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.916
It's got to come from Hell, right?

13:11.999 --> 13:14.627
Some, I don't know, battery?

13:15.711 --> 13:18.088
So I'll find the Dark Lord's
source of power,

13:18.172 --> 13:19.799
claim it, and deliver it unto the coven.

13:19.882 --> 13:23.761
Theoretically, that could work,
but Hell is a vast realm, Sabrina.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.179
How do you intend on finding this?

13:25.262 --> 13:27.056
I'll ask Lilith. She knows all the tea.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.271
All right.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.524
But Ambrose goes with you.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.441
Hell?

13:37.983 --> 13:40.820
Aunt Zee, I'm Queen of Hell.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.571
I don't care
if you're the Queen of England.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.449
You're still my niece. I won't have
you going to one of the Nether Realms

13:45.533 --> 13:47.535
without some familial support.

13:47.701 --> 13:50.204
Or, of course, we could all come with you.

13:50.287 --> 13:53.833
-Ooh! Blimey, what would I wear?
-Fine, Ambrose can come.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.210
Well, what am I going to wear?

14:07.930 --> 14:12.059
Mr. Scratch, can't keep away from me,
can you? That's how it always is.

14:12.142 --> 14:18.065
You tortured me
for what felt like an eternity.

14:20.317 --> 14:21.527
Now it's my turn, bitch.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.619
I know the carnival
doesn't open for a while,

14:30.703 --> 14:33.122
but isn't it weird that no one's here?

14:34.206 --> 14:35.124
Yeah.

14:35.916 --> 14:38.085
But it makes it easier for us, at least.

14:42.464 --> 14:43.924
Okay, guys,

14:44.508 --> 14:46.051
I'll sneak into the snake charmer's tent

14:46.135 --> 14:49.722
and touch something of hers,
maybe her hairbrush or something.

14:50.347 --> 14:53.559
And hopefully, the cunning will tell me
who she is and what she wants.

14:54.018 --> 14:54.977
You guys keep watch.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.021
Right.

15:44.318 --> 15:47.154
You're the sex-obsessed seer.

15:54.078 --> 15:54.995
Well...

15:56.288 --> 15:58.082
you've saved me a trip.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.798
You, boys, what are you doing here?

16:05.881 --> 16:08.092
My carnival is closed today.
It's a holy day.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.303
Let's get out of here.

16:19.603 --> 16:21.313
She won't be troubling us again.

16:26.026 --> 16:28.028
Thank you for warning us,
Robin Goodfellow.

16:28.112 --> 16:32.074
Now, my dears, we may celebrate Ostera
with light hearts.

16:40.791 --> 16:43.877
Oh, how I've missed your virility.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.671
Stop talking!

16:49.508 --> 16:52.011
And what about you, Nicholas?
Have you missed me?

16:52.511 --> 16:54.304
What am I saying? Of course you have,

16:54.388 --> 16:59.268
else you wouldn't be here
desperate for contact, any contact.

17:05.524 --> 17:06.567
Don't fret!

17:07.651 --> 17:10.571
There'll always be a piece of me
inside you.

17:12.322 --> 17:17.119
You do realize you're not punishing me,
just Blackwood's flesh suit.

17:17.661 --> 17:21.665
Not that I would mind it,
I like it when things get a bit rough.

17:22.124 --> 17:28.088
Anyway, I'm not really the person
you want to be punishing, am I, Nick?

17:29.089 --> 17:31.550
That would be you.

17:43.062 --> 17:46.023
That boy knows nothing of true Hell,

17:46.106 --> 17:49.985
but he will when I rip him limb-from-limb!

17:50.069 --> 17:52.404
You'll have your chance, Faustus.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.156
Nicholas is fraying at the edges.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.784
He'll be back to see us. Mark my words.

17:56.867 --> 17:57.868
And when he does return,

17:57.951 --> 18:03.207
I'll have something for him
that will make him do anything we want.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.218
What's he doing here?

18:14.301 --> 18:15.552
Ambrose is my--

18:15.636 --> 18:17.346
Privy counselor.

18:18.388 --> 18:19.473
Privy counselor.

18:20.057 --> 18:23.102
Oh, this is Hell. I am in Hell.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.521
Crowley never made it to Hell, but I,

18:26.980 --> 18:29.942
Ambrose Spellman, am in Hell.

18:32.694 --> 18:34.446
In any case, we need your help.

18:34.530 --> 18:37.699
My annoying father
is withholding his dark gifts,

18:37.783 --> 18:40.452
his power from my coven.
We need it restored.

18:40.536 --> 18:42.663
Well, I'm sorry. I can't help with that.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.082
Well, surely he gets his energies
from somewhere in Hell.

18:45.165 --> 18:48.293
A lake of fire,
an infernal furnace, something?

18:48.377 --> 18:51.088
They are not Hell's gifts.
They're Lucifer's.

18:51.171 --> 18:52.506
They come from within him.

18:52.589 --> 18:56.593
They originate with him,
and he dispenses them as he sees fit.

18:56.677 --> 18:57.845
What are you saying, that--

18:57.928 --> 19:00.097
That Lucifer's powers
come from him being an angel, yes.

19:00.889 --> 19:02.975
That he's Heaven-born.

19:03.934 --> 19:08.105
Of course, Lucifer's power is celestial,
not infernal.

19:08.188 --> 19:10.149
That makes perfect sense.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.902
Well, if Lucifer's power
comes from his essence,

19:13.986 --> 19:16.780
then I, as his daughter,
must have it too, right?

19:16.864 --> 19:21.118
Polluted and diluted
by your mother's mortal blood,

19:21.785 --> 19:23.328
useless to your coven.

19:23.412 --> 19:27.541
Hold on. If Lucifer the angel
is denying us our gifts, then we--

19:27.624 --> 19:29.376
Then we need to find ourselves
another angel.

19:31.795 --> 19:35.424
Well, you won't be getting into Heaven,
if that's what you're thinking.

19:35.507 --> 19:36.383
It's not.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.343
<i>I don't understand, Hilda.</i>

19:39.261 --> 19:43.140
Why would Sabrina lie to us so wantonly?

19:43.223 --> 19:45.934
Keep something like that to herself.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.771
She's... she's the Queen of Hell, Hilda,

19:50.480 --> 19:52.566
-which changes everything.
-I know.

19:52.649 --> 19:54.109
-Not that she sees that yet.
-I know.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.320
You know, sister,

19:57.779 --> 20:01.074
I believe it's the lies
that irk me more than anything else.

20:01.491 --> 20:03.911
This family is seemingly riddled
with them.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.040
Um... um...

20:08.123 --> 20:12.461
No, it's funny
that you should say that now,

20:12.544 --> 20:16.006
because, um, I...
I have something to share.

20:16.089 --> 20:20.052
I just haven't had the right... to say...

20:22.429 --> 20:24.181
Dr. Cee proposed...

20:25.766 --> 20:28.393
marriage... to me.

20:33.273 --> 20:34.524
-Did he?
-Hm.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.818
And you accepted, I take it?

20:36.902 --> 20:39.529
Well, we haven't set a date yet, and...

20:39.613 --> 20:40.739
Are you mad at me?

20:44.952 --> 20:45.869
Mad?

20:47.788 --> 20:49.665
-No, sister, I am not mad.
-Oh.

20:49.748 --> 20:53.252
I'm not mad that both you
and Sabrina are deserting me,

20:53.961 --> 20:55.337
deserting this family,

20:55.879 --> 20:59.591
deserting our coven
in our greatest hour of need.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.554
I am sadly unsurprised...

21:05.722 --> 21:07.057
and resigned.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.357
What can I help you with?

21:15.440 --> 21:18.110
The witch hunters who attacked the Academy
last year were angels.

21:18.193 --> 21:19.361
I killed two of them,

21:19.444 --> 21:22.406
but Nick said you and he trapped
a third one here in a painting.

21:22.489 --> 21:25.284
Yes, in the Caravaggio,
if I'm remembering it correctly.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.995
We need to get him out, and we need
to siphon off some of his energy.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.956
Via bloodletting. Then everyone
in our coven could drink some.

21:31.039 --> 21:32.499
Could you help us with that?

21:32.833 --> 21:34.042
It's like tapping a barrel,

21:34.126 --> 21:36.086
and I'd be a sorry barkeeper
if I couldn't do that.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.047
Would you like me to do it

21:39.131 --> 21:41.800
-and deliver the blood to you?
-No, this is too important.

21:42.134 --> 21:45.095
Ambrose, go home and get Aunt Zelda
on board with the plan.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.974
I'll stay here and wait for the blood.
Just to be sure.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.810
Yes. I'll bring out the Caravaggio.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.818
We should take her to a hospital.

21:59.901 --> 22:02.112
Come on, Theo,
you know whatever happened to her,

22:02.195 --> 22:04.448
it's... it's magic-related.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.659
Roz, can you tell us what happened to you?

22:08.994 --> 22:10.162
She's so cold she can't talk.

22:10.245 --> 22:14.041
Get Sa... bri... na.

22:14.124 --> 22:17.336
She's right,
Sabrina would know what to do.

22:17.419 --> 22:21.089
Okay, Theo, you stay here,
I'll go get her.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.303
It's going to be okay.

22:38.398 --> 22:40.233
Don't kill him
in case we need more blood later.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.152
Yes, yes.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.908
Mmm. Delicious.

22:47.991 --> 22:48.825
What?

22:49.201 --> 22:52.704
You can hardly expect me to decant
a celestial without sampling the vintage.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.795
- Yes, I'm coming.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.506
I'm coming. Goodness.

23:02.589 --> 23:04.591
-Hey! Oh, my.
-Ms. Spellman, is Sabrina in?

23:04.674 --> 23:05.717
Oh, no.

23:06.259 --> 23:08.762
She's not, my love. She--

23:08.845 --> 23:11.515
-Why, has something happened?
-It's Roz, Ms. Spellman.

23:11.807 --> 23:13.016
She's really sick.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.018
She was at the carnival,
and she went into a tent,

23:15.102 --> 23:17.187
and then something bad happened,
something witchy.

23:17.270 --> 23:19.356
-At the carnival?
-Yeah, it's a long story.

23:19.439 --> 23:23.360
But Ms. Spellman, Roz is freezing,
and she won't stop shaking.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.696
-Will you come check on her?
-Oh, my love, I would if I could.

23:26.780 --> 23:30.700
It's just, our powers, they're waning.

23:30.784 --> 23:33.912
I mean, the whole coven.
We're in a bit of a tricky spot, actually.

23:33.995 --> 23:37.124
I was just about to go to the library
because I have a hunch that...

23:37.666 --> 23:38.708
Okay, wait there.

23:38.792 --> 23:42.921
In the meantime, wrap Roz in this.

23:43.004 --> 23:44.673
It will keep her nice and warm.

23:44.756 --> 23:47.300
And when we're back up to speed here,
Sabrina and I will come over,

23:47.384 --> 23:50.178
and we'll get Rosalind as right as rain.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.721
-Okay?
-Thank you, Ms. Spellman.

23:51.805 --> 23:52.681
Of course.

24:05.735 --> 24:06.903
What was that?

24:06.987 --> 24:07.863
What was what?

24:07.946 --> 24:09.573
-Well, it sounded like--

24:10.740 --> 24:13.410
Dorian, are you torturing someone
in there?

24:13.493 --> 24:16.079
Not exactly torturing, no.

24:26.673 --> 24:27.757
Hang on!

24:31.803 --> 24:33.263
<i>♪ Mix it up ♪ </i>

24:35.765 --> 24:37.601
<i>♪ Mix it up ♪</i>

24:38.268 --> 24:40.270
<i>♪ All night, all night ♪</i>

24:40.687 --> 24:41.771
Nick?

24:43.565 --> 24:44.733
Sabrina?

24:45.859 --> 24:47.360
-I can explain!
-No.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.698
No explanation needed.
It's pretty clear what's going on here.

24:52.365 --> 24:53.408
Sabrina!

24:56.536 --> 24:57.621
Dorian!

24:58.163 --> 24:59.748
That was blood for my coven!

24:59.831 --> 25:01.124
Do excuse me.

25:02.292 --> 25:04.419
I thought it might help
with my complexion.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.463
I did save you some, though.

25:09.049 --> 25:09.966
I hope that's enough.

25:11.009 --> 25:13.386
Is everyone insane?

25:19.017 --> 25:22.270
Oh, you just missed her.

25:31.154 --> 25:32.197
What's the matter with you?

25:32.280 --> 25:34.616
You look as if
you've seen the Holy Spirit.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.326
I don't want to talk about it, Aunt Zee...

25:39.037 --> 25:39.996
but I got it.

25:40.580 --> 25:43.875
I'm sorry, is that the angel's blood
you've been talking about, Ambrose?

25:43.959 --> 25:44.834
It is.

25:45.627 --> 25:47.212
Though where is the rest of it?

25:47.295 --> 25:48.630
Dorian gorged himself on it.

25:48.713 --> 25:51.591
That is your grand plan?
That is what is meant to save us?

25:51.675 --> 25:54.761
We were all supposed to drink it,
but there was supposed to be more of it.

25:54.844 --> 25:58.139
-Maybe if we each take a sip?
-No, that won't nearly be enough.

25:58.223 --> 26:01.226
-There might be if we use it another way.
-What way is that, Auntie?

26:01.309 --> 26:03.478
Okay, I was remembering
something that I did

26:03.562 --> 26:05.438
when I was a student at the Academy.

26:06.439 --> 26:08.066
I took a moon bath.

26:08.567 --> 26:09.442
What's a moon bath?

26:09.526 --> 26:12.445
So it's a ceremony
that witches used to perform

26:12.529 --> 26:14.197
during the celebration of the Hare Moon.

26:14.281 --> 26:19.536
They would rub their bodies with oils
and bathe in the moonlight.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.497
It was meant to be a symbolic rebirth.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.916
Light from the moon was meant
to replenish us. But...

26:25.750 --> 26:29.796
if we take that angel's blood
and we mix it with certain oils,

26:29.879 --> 26:34.134
and then we rub it into our bodies
and bathe in the light of the Hare Moon--

26:34.217 --> 26:37.137
The symbolic could be literal.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.264
-Yeah.
-It is law of occult science

26:39.347 --> 26:40.890
that celestial substances

26:40.974 --> 26:43.268
are activated by celestial bodies.

26:43.977 --> 26:46.855
The moonlight would activate
the angel's blood,

26:46.938 --> 26:49.065
which in turn would allow our skin

26:49.149 --> 26:51.818
to actually absorb the energies
of the moon.

26:52.527 --> 26:53.695
We might be saved.

26:53.778 --> 26:54.613
Oh.

26:56.448 --> 27:00.076
And I am still a part of this coven.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.245
As am I.

27:04.664 --> 27:06.583
This plan is nothing short of lunacy.

27:06.666 --> 27:09.336
Yes, it is lunacy,

27:09.419 --> 27:12.881
as in pertaining to the moon,
lunar, lunacy.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.175
So be it.

27:16.217 --> 27:19.929
Picnic first
and then this so-called moon bath.

27:20.764 --> 27:23.642
And don't break your arm
patting yourself on your back, sister.

27:23.725 --> 27:24.809
You've still got work to do.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.186
Oh, right.

27:26.269 --> 27:27.646
Give me the blood, love,

27:27.729 --> 27:31.066
and I will start preparing
the anointing oil.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.025
Thank you, Hilda.

27:35.570 --> 27:36.696
And thank you, Sabrina.

27:37.947 --> 27:40.158
If this works,
the entire coven will be in your debt.

27:43.787 --> 27:45.664
-Hey, I meant to tell you,

27:45.747 --> 27:48.750
sweet Harvey dropped by the house earlier
looking for you.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.502
He's a bit worried about Roz.

27:50.585 --> 27:53.254
Says she has some sort of witchy fever.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.215
-Well, should I go check on her?
-Oh, no.

27:55.298 --> 27:58.927
I mean, I said that we would, you know,
once we got our powers squared away.

28:00.762 --> 28:03.348
-Add Nick to that list.
-What's the matter with him now?

28:03.431 --> 28:06.893
He's been moody,
and I think he's been drinking.

28:07.435 --> 28:11.648
And I just caught him cavorting
with sex demons.

28:12.941 --> 28:17.821
I mean, he's a warlock of a certain age.
Apparently, that goes with the territory.

28:17.904 --> 28:22.492
Of course, Nick has always been a bad boy,
but this is different.

28:23.785 --> 28:28.248
I think something horrible happened to him
while he was trapped with Lucifer.

28:29.165 --> 28:31.000
Worse than any of us could imagine.

28:31.084 --> 28:32.627
Oh, my darling.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.630
You have to have a talk with him...

28:36.756 --> 28:37.674
but...

28:38.258 --> 28:39.759
After the Hare Moon.

28:40.677 --> 28:41.511
I know.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.306
I need to keep it together
for the sake of the coven.

28:46.516 --> 28:47.684
Well, look at you.

28:52.105 --> 28:53.773
-Very pretty.
-Mm.

30:41.923 --> 30:42.757
Aunties!

30:44.467 --> 30:45.760
We have to go right now!

30:45.844 --> 30:48.847
Wait, we can't. We just got started.
Look who's here.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.474
Nick.<i> </i>What are you doing here?

30:51.558 --> 30:53.059
I wanted to be a part of this.

30:53.142 --> 30:54.936
No, you don't understand.

30:55.019 --> 30:55.854
What?

31:14.914 --> 31:17.250
Roz, maybe if you moved around,
it would help you warm up.

31:17.333 --> 31:18.751
She can't! She can't move!

31:19.377 --> 31:20.420
This is nuts.

31:20.503 --> 31:22.130
I'm not sitting around
waiting for Sabrina.

31:22.213 --> 31:24.507
We have to do something
before it's too late!

31:28.636 --> 31:31.139
Harvey?<i> </i>Where are you going?

31:33.391 --> 31:37.186
Back to the carnival... to find out
what the hell happened to Roz.

31:38.396 --> 31:39.230
Harvey!

31:52.035 --> 31:55.330
Forgive us. We did not mean
to disturb your celebration.

31:55.413 --> 31:57.999
We have come in search of a place
to celebrate as well.

32:01.669 --> 32:02.837
Celebrate what?

32:02.921 --> 32:04.088
Ostera.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.633
And what is it you are celebrating?

32:07.133 --> 32:08.509
The Hare Moon.

32:19.228 --> 32:21.064
Oh, I mean, we were just, um...

32:22.231 --> 32:25.526
well, we were just about
to have a spot of lunch.

32:25.610 --> 32:31.366
We've got Nutella and bread
and cheese and wine and cold cuts,

32:31.866 --> 32:33.493
if you all want to join us?

32:50.009 --> 32:51.260
Oh.

32:58.559 --> 33:00.561
Ah, this is exciting.

33:01.562 --> 33:04.816
-I've worked up quite an appetite.
-Agreed. Let's dig in.

33:04.899 --> 33:08.152
Mistress Spellman, should we say
a prayer of thanks to Lilith first?

33:11.948 --> 33:12.949
Lilith?

33:15.618 --> 33:17.912
You pray to Lilith and not your Dark Lord?

33:19.622 --> 33:22.250
No, Elspeth, no prayers are necessary.

33:24.043 --> 33:27.463
Whatever the case,
I don't believe our guests pray to Lilith.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.674
-Do you?
-No, we do not.

33:29.757 --> 33:30.800
Oh.

33:30.883 --> 33:33.886
We pray to... others.

33:39.767 --> 33:42.103
So, you all work at the carnival?

33:42.186 --> 33:44.689
The Phantasmagoria, yes.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.733
And Ostera.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.235
That's a version of Easter, isn't it?

33:50.111 --> 33:52.238
Our ways are little known
in the outside world.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.702
And what of your rites,

33:58.578 --> 34:02.206
is it customary
to fornicate on your holidays?

34:02.290 --> 34:03.666
What?

34:05.668 --> 34:11.466
Ah... I see. He shares his carnal embraces
with others, but not you.

34:11.549 --> 34:12.925
You don't know anything about me.

34:13.009 --> 34:15.219
Well, she's not exactly wrong,
is she, Nick?

34:15.303 --> 34:18.431
Your soul is shrouded in darkness,

34:19.182 --> 34:20.141
bloated.

34:21.642 --> 34:23.728
And you reek of sex.

34:30.651 --> 34:34.197
How long have you and your people
been in Greendale?

34:34.280 --> 34:35.323
Generations.

34:35.406 --> 34:36.949
We're from the old country.

34:37.033 --> 34:39.577
The very old country.
The old, old country.

34:43.164 --> 34:46.751
And your community,
where do you hail from?

34:48.294 --> 34:50.755
-All the Earth is our home.
-You're drifters then.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.216
My family and I, we follow many roads.

34:53.299 --> 34:56.636
So Greendale is just
one of your many stops,

34:56.719 --> 34:58.012
and you'll be moving on soon?

34:58.096 --> 34:59.055
Perhaps...

35:00.515 --> 35:03.476
but there is something
about the land here that makes one...

35:04.685 --> 35:06.229
wish to set down roots.

35:12.860 --> 35:17.031
It's so good to have a picnic
out in the fresh air.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.449
Nothing beats that.

35:20.159 --> 35:24.580
Um... I wish that I got outdoors more,
because my hobbies,

35:24.664 --> 35:26.791
they're more like indoor activities.

35:26.874 --> 35:29.585
You know, like knitting,
and writing, and--

35:29.669 --> 35:31.712
-You're a weaver.
-I'm a what?

35:31.796 --> 35:34.173
You weave fabrics and stories, do you not?

35:35.550 --> 35:40.138
Oh, never thought of it that way,
a weaver.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.683
I'm a weaver. I really like that.

35:48.229 --> 35:49.230
Oh.

35:52.900 --> 35:55.862
Please don't hurt it.

35:55.945 --> 35:57.822
Of course I wouldn't hurt it.

35:57.905 --> 35:58.906
No.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.868
I'm going to take this little chap
back home with me.

36:01.993 --> 36:02.994
I keep them as pets.

36:03.077 --> 36:06.080
You keep spiders as pets?

36:06.581 --> 36:07.665
Uh... yeah.

36:10.084 --> 36:10.918
Uh...

36:13.171 --> 36:15.548
They're very, very happy, though.

36:15.631 --> 36:16.591
They're not happy.

36:17.258 --> 36:20.344
How could you possibly know
what a spider feels?

36:22.847 --> 36:23.723
So...

36:24.599 --> 36:26.851
<i>Metamorfóste, sto ónoma tis Aráchnis.</i>

36:27.602 --> 36:30.188
Circe, may I speak with you for a moment?

36:41.115 --> 36:45.494
They're heathens.
They enslave animals, keep them as pets.

36:45.578 --> 36:48.206
Not pets, familiars.

36:49.081 --> 36:52.126
They're Satanic witches,
but something is...

36:53.211 --> 36:55.880
-wrong with them.
- They're weak.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.132
They smell of weakness.

36:58.674 --> 37:00.301
They're bloody pagan witches.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.554
What are pagans doing here though
in our clearing?

37:03.638 --> 37:07.141
Causing havoc as pagans are wont to do.
I thought they were gone

37:07.225 --> 37:08.392
from this part of the country,

37:08.476 --> 37:11.270
-honestly, the whole country.
-Didn't pagan witches die out when...

37:11.354 --> 37:14.857
When Satanic witches ascended, yes.
As when Christians came to power.

37:14.941 --> 37:17.276
They're probably some fringe group.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.528
Well, they can't just interrupt
our moon bath.

37:19.612 --> 37:21.530
We have to, like, banish them.

37:21.614 --> 37:22.615
We don't have the strength

37:22.698 --> 37:24.492
-to confront them head-on.
-What about rain?

37:25.034 --> 37:27.453
We could conjure a storm.
That might get them to leave.

37:28.996 --> 37:30.456
Well, we must try something.

37:34.543 --> 37:38.130
Mystic forces we invite,
fill the skies with clouds of night.

37:38.214 --> 37:41.968
Be ye far or be ye near,
we summon rain to appear.

37:42.051 --> 37:45.012
Sky above, gone the sun,
melodies just begun.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.765
Sky above, come undone,
shower rain on everyone.

37:47.848 --> 37:51.352
Sky above, come undone,
shower rain on everyone.

37:51.435 --> 37:54.522
Sky above, come undone,
shower rain on everyone.

37:54.605 --> 37:57.733
Sky above, come undone,
shower rain on everyone.

38:08.035 --> 38:11.872
Sky above, come undone,
shower rain on everyone.

38:11.956 --> 38:15.209
Sky above, come undone,
shower rain on everyone.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.544
Sky above...

38:18.879 --> 38:20.089
Bloody hell.

38:20.172 --> 38:22.758
We've finally hit rock bottom.
We've lost it.

38:23.342 --> 38:24.302
We're too weak.

38:29.181 --> 38:30.349
Hey, Nick.

38:32.893 --> 38:34.353
Finally got you alone.

38:35.187 --> 38:37.231
Get lost, Dorcas. I'm not in the mood.

38:38.524 --> 38:39.734
Why are you so grumpy?

38:40.568 --> 38:42.820
I hear you've been having
a lot of fun lately.

38:43.362 --> 38:44.822
De Sade and Salo?

38:45.406 --> 38:47.158
Did Sabrina tell you that?

38:47.825 --> 38:48.659
Please.

38:49.201 --> 38:51.871
You're not the only witch
who parties with sex demons.

38:54.623 --> 38:56.709
You don't have to go to them for that.

38:57.793 --> 38:59.086
You can come to me.

39:00.838 --> 39:04.842
I can show you some serious splendor
in the grass.

39:05.468 --> 39:06.886
-Ahh!

39:08.012 --> 39:09.430
-Help me!
-Dorcas, are you all right?

39:09.513 --> 39:11.599
-It bit me!
-Is she hurt?

39:11.932 --> 39:13.559
Someone get me some moss.

39:14.268 --> 39:16.354
It hurts. Do something!

39:16.437 --> 39:19.774
And I'd like some wet mud
if anyone could...

39:19.857 --> 39:21.359
A little bit of tree bark.

39:24.403 --> 39:25.237
What?

39:41.379 --> 39:43.172
That snake won't be hurting anyone else.

39:47.510 --> 39:48.469
Murderer!

39:49.136 --> 39:51.639
We are the guests in this place.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.349
It is the snake that lives here.

39:53.891 --> 39:56.268
It was its right to protect its territory.

39:57.186 --> 39:58.729
-We should leave.
-Yes.

39:58.813 --> 40:00.481
Perhaps that's best.

40:00.564 --> 40:01.607
We were here first.

40:01.690 --> 40:05.694
No, we were here first,
before the false god,

40:05.778 --> 40:07.279
before your Dark Lord.

40:07.363 --> 40:10.199
The old gods reigned,
and we worshiped them.

40:10.282 --> 40:12.701
Now something has happened, it's clear,

40:13.661 --> 40:16.330
and our time has come around again.

40:17.623 --> 40:19.041
We apologize, please.

40:19.125 --> 40:20.626
Well, don't leave like this.

40:20.709 --> 40:22.169
He raised his hand.

41:42.791 --> 41:43.709
Roz.

41:48.839 --> 41:51.342
What do you have to say for yourself,
Mr. Scratch?

41:51.425 --> 41:54.803
I killed a snake that bit one of our own.
What's so wrong about that?

41:54.887 --> 41:57.014
They probably worship snakes,
and you just murdered one.

41:57.097 --> 42:00.893
Pagans are not to be trifled with,
especially not while we're without powers.

42:00.976 --> 42:04.271
Well, look, why don't we send
an offering to make amends?

42:04.355 --> 42:08.108
Nicholas, would you like to give them
my yummy moon pie?

42:08.692 --> 42:12.154
I'm not apologizing.
I didn't do anything wrong.

42:12.238 --> 42:15.658
Nick, it's a gesture,
if only to protect the coven.

42:15.741 --> 42:18.244
Well, I've done enough
to protect this coven, haven't I?

42:19.662 --> 42:20.663
Nick?

42:22.081 --> 42:23.999
I detest teen angst.

42:24.792 --> 42:27.545
Dorcas, you were at the center
of this brouhaha.

42:27.628 --> 42:29.880
Will you take the offering to the pagans?

42:29.964 --> 42:32.049
Sure. Whatever.

42:32.132 --> 42:34.677
Oh, Melvin and Agatha will go with you.

42:35.386 --> 42:36.428
I'm a big girl.

42:36.971 --> 42:39.139
I can deliver a pie by myself.

42:43.435 --> 42:44.979
Agatha, follow her, please.

42:45.062 --> 42:46.814
Make sure she doesn't foul this up.

42:52.361 --> 42:53.362
Nicholas.

42:54.613 --> 42:55.531
Stop.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.033
Hey, stop! Stop!

42:58.367 --> 42:59.201
What?

42:59.577 --> 43:01.120
-We have to talk about this.
-Which part?

43:01.704 --> 43:04.832
How about the part where you got drunk
and cheated on me with sex demons?

43:04.915 --> 43:08.127
Of course you'd find some way
to make my suffering about you.

43:08.210 --> 43:11.130
-It's always about you, isn't it, Sabrina?
-I just want to know what's wrong

43:11.213 --> 43:12.798
so I can help you.

43:13.382 --> 43:14.633
You heard the pagan.

43:15.384 --> 43:17.803
I'm dirty, polluted.

43:17.886 --> 43:19.013
No, Nick.

43:19.638 --> 43:21.849
You've been through trauma, that's all.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.018
-That's all?
-Look...

43:24.101 --> 43:28.564
I know you're drinking and doing drugs
and letting sex demons whip you,

43:28.647 --> 43:31.025
so you don't have to deal with
whatever happened,

43:31.734 --> 43:34.069
but what happened down there?

43:34.778 --> 43:36.739
Please tell me.

43:37.156 --> 43:39.783
Down there? You can say it, Sabrina.

43:41.035 --> 43:41.869
Hell.

43:43.162 --> 43:44.747
I went to Hell.

43:46.248 --> 43:49.084
I took the Dark Lord inside me.

43:50.002 --> 43:53.464
I was stripped naked
and put in chains by Lilith,

43:53.547 --> 43:55.132
tortured on the inside,

43:55.215 --> 43:58.802
humiliated and debased on the outside
for weeks.

43:58.886 --> 44:00.512
That felt like decades.

44:02.097 --> 44:06.560
And there was no reprieve, no respite,
not for one lousy second.

44:06.644 --> 44:09.021
It was-- It was a catalog of violation.

44:10.022 --> 44:13.192
I had no control over my body or my fate.

44:15.361 --> 44:19.740
I was a punching bag for Lucifer
and a plaything for Lilith.

44:20.658 --> 44:24.828
I wrestled your father for dominance,
and it was exhausting.

44:24.912 --> 44:27.373
I didn't sleep, not once.

44:27.456 --> 44:31.335
It was a place of no rest,
no peace, just... just pain,

44:31.418 --> 44:34.880
and hurt and burning and freezing.

44:38.467 --> 44:40.344
All to protect you,

44:41.136 --> 44:44.098
and this world
that you care so much about.

44:44.181 --> 44:45.683
-Nick, I am so sorry.
-Sorry?

44:47.017 --> 44:51.230
Sabrina, you didn't forget my birthday
or show up late to the movies.

44:51.313 --> 44:54.233
You let me sacrifice myself for you,

44:56.610 --> 44:57.611
and you...

45:00.364 --> 45:02.032
you weren't worth it.

45:06.829 --> 45:08.580
-You're upset.
-Yeah, you think?

45:11.917 --> 45:13.419
As for the sex demons, Sabrina, well,

45:13.502 --> 45:15.421
it's not like I get that kind of comfort
from you.

45:15.504 --> 45:19.299
Because deep, deep down, you know
you're saving yourself for someone else,

45:19.383 --> 45:22.678
-and we both know who.
-That's not fair, and that's not true.

45:22.761 --> 45:26.098
You don't know what you're saying.
But please, let me help you.

45:26.181 --> 45:27.015
Help me?

45:29.893 --> 45:32.229
I don't want anything from you.

45:34.690 --> 45:38.485
Every time I look at you,
all I see is your father.

45:40.529 --> 45:41.905
He's everywhere.

45:44.032 --> 45:47.369
He's what I see when I close my eyes
and when I open them.

45:49.872 --> 45:53.000
And I swear,
if I could beat him out of me, I would.

45:53.083 --> 45:54.168
But I can't.

45:56.170 --> 45:57.796
So I'll do the next best thing.

46:26.366 --> 46:27.284
Who's there?

47:25.133 --> 47:26.093
Hello?

47:29.930 --> 47:32.516
Agatha, if this is a joke, you're dead.

47:36.895 --> 47:40.732
Your sister is detained.

47:46.154 --> 47:47.030
Who?

47:47.865 --> 47:48.907
Who are you?

47:56.582 --> 47:57.583
Ah!

47:58.709 --> 47:59.543
Welcome back.

48:00.878 --> 48:02.754
Couldn't stay away, could you?

48:03.213 --> 48:04.381
I'm done with this...

48:05.090 --> 48:06.258
and with you.

48:06.842 --> 48:09.011
Only one of us is leaving
this cell alive tonight.

48:09.094 --> 48:10.137
Oh, that's fine.

48:10.429 --> 48:12.514
But before we get started,

48:13.140 --> 48:15.976
may I bestow upon you
a most delicious gift?

48:22.858 --> 48:23.817
Red mercury.

48:24.359 --> 48:27.696
Best rush of your life, to die for.

48:29.656 --> 48:30.908
Dragon's tears.

48:30.991 --> 48:35.287
You go up, but you never come down.

48:36.163 --> 48:37.456
I'll give you both

48:38.081 --> 48:40.292
if you do me one...

48:41.084 --> 48:43.462
tiny favor.

48:51.428 --> 48:53.680
Cousin, are you all right?

48:54.806 --> 48:55.974
Yeah, I'm fine.

48:56.058 --> 48:57.184
Let's just do this.

48:57.267 --> 48:58.602
Okay, my darlings.

48:58.685 --> 49:01.229
So they are all applying the sacred oil.

49:01.313 --> 49:03.106
The moon's full.
I think we should get started.

49:03.190 --> 49:05.734
-Can't we wait for my sisters?
-They'll join in when they return.

49:06.360 --> 49:07.986
All right, Hilda, what do we do?

49:08.487 --> 49:11.073
Okay, cover any exposed skin
with the oils,

49:11.156 --> 49:13.283
and lie down with everyone else.

49:17.871 --> 49:18.830
Coven...

49:20.290 --> 49:21.750
sisters, brothers,

49:22.918 --> 49:25.963
as you know,
tonight we honor the Hare Moon,

49:26.630 --> 49:28.382
for the Hare Moon is special.

49:28.465 --> 49:32.594
It's the nexus point
of all the magical calendars

49:32.678 --> 49:35.305
where witches celebrate renewal.

49:36.348 --> 49:41.103
And tonight, tonight,
your Hare Moon is full once again.

49:41.770 --> 49:44.022
And its light shines on you,

49:44.106 --> 49:50.445
and you drink it in
and claim your power and feel it.

49:50.529 --> 49:52.114
Feel it on your skin.

49:58.161 --> 50:01.331
Mother moon, in the fullest of your form,

50:02.207 --> 50:04.459
we ask that you bless us with your gifts,

50:05.377 --> 50:06.545
your energies.

50:07.879 --> 50:10.215
As you ripen like a babe in the belly,

50:11.758 --> 50:13.135
make us whole again,

50:13.218 --> 50:16.388
make our magicks multiply
in the spirit of the hare.

50:16.805 --> 50:18.640
We offer you our bodies,

50:19.391 --> 50:22.602
anointed in celestial essence,

50:22.686 --> 50:25.355
that we may become vessels
of your energies.

50:29.192 --> 50:31.028
Everyone seal the circle.

50:46.460 --> 50:47.627
I can feel it.

50:48.128 --> 50:50.881
It's... it's like goosebumps.

50:50.964 --> 50:52.883
I feel tingly all over.

50:53.842 --> 50:55.135
I am as well!

50:55.218 --> 50:58.263
It's funny, isn't it?
Like pins and needles.

50:58.847 --> 51:01.850
Like your foot fell asleep,
and it's just woken up again.

51:01.933 --> 51:04.227
Well, at least
something's gone right today.

51:28.627 --> 51:30.087
They've lost their Dark Lord.

51:31.505 --> 51:33.965
Now let us take away their Hare Moon.

51:36.593 --> 51:40.180
Hail, Selene, attend now our tune.

51:40.263 --> 51:44.559
Darken your daughter,
our night lamp, the moon.

51:44.976 --> 51:49.272
Piece by piece, and slice by slice.

51:49.940 --> 51:53.985
As they go down, let the moon be consumed.

52:06.998 --> 52:07.833
Wait.

52:12.420 --> 52:13.296
Wait!

52:14.297 --> 52:15.841
What's happening to the moon?

52:15.924 --> 52:18.844
An eclipse? That's impossible.
It would have been in the almanac.

52:18.927 --> 52:21.346
Oh, no. Someone's swallowing the moon.

52:21.429 --> 52:24.474
I believe you're right, sister,
and I believe I know who's doing it.

52:24.558 --> 52:26.059
It's those blessed pagans.

52:26.726 --> 52:28.812
-They're attacking us.
-Auntie, what should we do?

52:28.895 --> 52:31.231
The moon bath won't work
under an eclipsed moon.

52:31.314 --> 52:33.066
Gather your things, students,
and make haste.

52:33.150 --> 52:35.110
The pagan witches mean to do us harm.

52:35.193 --> 52:37.696
We're exposed here. We need to get back
to the Academy, all of us.

52:37.779 --> 52:39.656
-I have to find Nick.
-I need to find my sisters!

52:39.739 --> 52:41.283
All of us, I said.

52:41.366 --> 52:45.370
Then when we're secure behind our walls,
we can plot our counter-attack.

52:45.453 --> 52:48.123
But no one is to go off alone tonight.

52:48.874 --> 52:50.709
We are in the gravest of danger.

52:55.046 --> 52:55.881
Theo...

52:57.382 --> 52:58.550
what happened?

53:15.066 --> 53:17.736
Get the beds ready.
We'll all sleep in here tonight.

53:17.819 --> 53:19.946
It'll be much safer if we're all together.

53:49.684 --> 53:50.727
Sister Spellman...

53:52.395 --> 53:53.355
they're outside.

54:19.005 --> 54:23.343
Witches of night, your time is over.
The old gods are returning.

54:24.886 --> 54:28.890
The old ways,
the blood ways, are coming back.

54:29.557 --> 54:31.977
Bow and pray to our gods,

54:33.520 --> 54:36.481
or your blood will be used
to water the sacred earth.

54:39.150 --> 54:41.027
You have three days to decide.

55:02.882 --> 55:04.134
Sisters?

55:05.802 --> 55:07.137
Sisters, come to us!

55:21.067 --> 55:22.402
<i>We have no choice.</i>

55:23.236 --> 55:28.033
The pagans are a clear and present danger,
and we are without strength.

55:28.116 --> 55:29.784
As dangerous as it will be,

55:30.952 --> 55:32.787
we must free the Dark Lord.

55:35.206 --> 55:38.126
Better the Devil you know
than the pagans you don't.

55:38.209 --> 55:41.296
He will be angry at us,
and there will be hell to pay,

55:43.089 --> 55:45.258
but he'll crush the pagans
under his hoof.

55:47.635 --> 55:48.595
I'll go down.

55:49.804 --> 55:51.097
He's my father.

55:51.681 --> 55:54.225
If anyone can sweet talk him, it's me.

56:01.149 --> 56:03.610
All right, Dad. It's just you and me now.

56:08.531 --> 56:10.867
Nick? Nick? Nick!

56:12.243 --> 56:13.411
Nick, can you hear me?

56:13.495 --> 56:14.579
Nick, wake up!

56:15.622 --> 56:16.623
Nick!

57:18.893 --> 57:20.895
Greg, move your head!
