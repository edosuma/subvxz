02:20.849 --> 02:21.801
Miss.

02:22.661 --> 02:24.989
What do you want?

02:25.052 --> 02:27.386
I told you not to come here to bother Benito.

02:28.633 --> 02:29.009
Benito!!

02:29.697 --> 02:33.377
You are a criminal and my
baby won't be a criminal like you.

02:35.218 --> 02:37.001
Benito is not coming out!!!

02:37.378 --> 02:40.821
Or I'll call the police to take you to jail,
that's what you want, you asshole.

02:40.901 --> 02:41.786
Grandma.

02:42.762 --> 02:45.089
You shut up and go back inside!

02:45.190 --> 02:50.090
You aren't going out I told you,
don't you understand spanish

03:06.569 --> 03:08.900
Let this be our secret my friend...

03:09.301 --> 03:11.201
...keep the secret here, ok?

03:16.585 --> 03:19.028
Lil' Mago ( Magician ) wants to see you.

03:34.029 --> 03:35.029
One...

03:41.030 --> 03:42.130
Two...

03:45.531 --> 03:46.731
Three...

03:48.132 --> 03:49.432
Four...

03:53.333 --> 03:54.633
Five...

03:57.634 --> 03:58.634
Six...

04:00.135 --> 04:01.335
Seven...

04:03.136 --> 04:04.136
Eight...

04:05.137 --> 04:06.037
Nine...

04:08.038 --> 04:08.838
Ten...

04:10.739 --> 04:11.439
Eleven...

04:12.840 --> 04:13.640
Twelve...

04:17.440 --> 04:18.940
Twelve...

04:19.541 --> 04:23.242
Twelve... Twelve...

04:26.243 --> 04:27.843
...Thirteen.

04:49.105 --> 04:52.151
Congratulations little Homie!

04:53.952 --> 05:00.442
Casper, look at the kids smile.

05:05.243 --> 05:07.106
The gang who controls "Salvatrucha" gang.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.422
Your dad is waiting for you.

05:23.710 --> 05:27.390
Look, I know why you
want to do this trip, but...

05:28.591 --> 05:30.891
...I don't know why I have to do it.

05:32.802 --> 05:36.539
If you don't want to go,
grandma can not make you go, but...

05:37.240 --> 05:39.540
...my brother won't come back for you again.

05:40.045 --> 05:46.623
Look, I don't need anyone, I can go
to the north by myself if I wanted to.

05:47.410 --> 05:55.545
Come with us, it won't be easy over
there, but at least we will be together.

05:58.412 --> 06:00.459
There is nothing for you here, Sayra.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.660
Nothing.

06:20.413 --> 06:21.216
She is here.

06:26.997 --> 06:31.080
Damn, if I didn't know I wouldn't recognize her.

06:37.897 --> 06:41.177
She is a lady now.

06:42.460 --> 06:45.208
Now you can recover your lost time.

06:45.337 --> 06:48.641
We will do that on the way mother.

06:51.616 --> 06:54.265
Tomorrow before sunrise we will grab the bus.

06:54.393 --> 06:57.224
Don't worry, she will be ready.

07:01.172 --> 07:06.479
"The Bombilla" Tapachula, Southern Mexico.

07:08.141 --> 07:10.644
Here is Lucrecia with her products.

07:11.613 --> 07:15.772
Casper, how have you been, now you
are a pederast?, the smaller the more idiots.

07:16.713 --> 07:19.176
Look how you beat him up, you are a barbarian.

07:19.893 --> 07:22.392
Tortillas, coffee, baleadas,soups!!!

07:37.297 --> 07:38.756
Thank you!

09:13.964 --> 09:16.680
Slow baby, slow..

09:29.912 --> 09:31.461
Stop it.

09:45.833 --> 09:48.525
Martha Marlene.

09:52.176 --> 09:53.645
I am bored.

09:53.764 --> 09:54.649
why?

09:56.209 --> 09:58.048
Can you take me somewhere?

09:59.488 --> 10:00.648
Where do you want to go?

10:01.293 --> 10:09.621
I don't know, wherever you want to,
where you go when you are not here.

10:13.258 --> 10:15.205
You have another girl in your neighborhood, right?

10:15.437 --> 10:16.449
Of course not.

10:17.392 --> 10:20.729
You better not, because if I
realize that you have other girl......

10:27.452 --> 10:28.813
What?

10:29.328 --> 10:30.397
It shrinked...

10:32.509 --> 10:34.372
Oh, it's normal, look...

10:35.473 --> 10:36.873
...now it will be refreshed.

10:40.186 --> 10:42.521
Do you think she will have a friend for me?

10:47.370 --> 10:49.229
Be careful my friend "Smiley"...

10:50.697 --> 10:52.985
...don't say anything that
we left from the "Bombilla"

10:53.285 --> 10:55.960
Don't say anything at all,
so Lil' Mago won't notice.

10:56.132 --> 10:56.684
Ok?

10:57.732 --> 10:58.264
Yes.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.065
Not a fucking word!

11:05.281 --> 11:11.049
Little Homie, you will first earn your letters,
hitting on a "Kiddo" (rival gangster)...

11:11.905 --> 11:16.544
...then after that, you will conquer a girl.

11:21.024 --> 11:23.368
Welcome to the destroyer.

11:24.164 --> 11:26.373
- What's up, homie?
- Cool, brother.

11:36.127 --> 11:38.323
What's up Casper you dog!

11:40.413 --> 11:42.516
What, did he kill a "kiddo" yet, uh?

11:47.376 --> 11:50.075
This is the "Naughty" and the "Smoky"...

11:50.559 --> 11:54.684
...they just arrived, they come and
go to see what's going on here.

11:55.067 --> 11:57.715
They are "Guanacos".
Are you thirsty?

12:17.971 --> 12:20.812
This guy is "gold" we call him "the buttocks"...

12:22.699 --> 12:25.643
...and this is the "Querubin".

12:29.135 --> 12:32.667
He can't sit , his ass is bleeding...

12:32.764 --> 12:36.579
...he has hemorroids.

12:54.365 --> 12:58.756
This you have to earn it...
for the moment you have to share.

12:58.804 --> 13:01.311
What's for the gang is for the gang.

13:07.571 --> 13:13.699
He is the one that has the second voice.

13:14.872 --> 13:17.924
Hey, my dogs are here.

13:21.732 --> 13:23.604
How was it?

13:24.228 --> 13:26.324
Did you go to the "Bombilla"?

13:26.848 --> 13:31.060
Yes, but we didn't find anything.

13:37.376 --> 13:41.356
The "Sol" found him with
another group of "chickens"...

13:42.157 --> 13:43.457
...in the "Bombilla".

13:45.060 --> 13:47.109
Take him out.

13:48.675 --> 13:53.716
Don't worry, nothing is happening,
now that dog that scares you will die.

14:00.963 --> 14:06.516
You fucked up "Kiddo",
you got in the train of the gang.

14:08.741 --> 14:13.516
I'm only going to the north, please, please!!

14:15.776 --> 14:18.465
You are already worthless you fucker...

14:18.738 --> 14:23.578
...we will cut you in 18 pieces
and we will feed the dogs.

14:24.306 --> 14:28.898
I have a family...
and I'm not a gangster anymore.

14:34.181 --> 14:38.927
"kiddo" will always be a "kiddo"

14:41.721 --> 14:45.565
Casper, give "Smiley" a hand.

14:46.833 --> 14:49.889
Both of you, get him.

15:01.086 --> 15:03.033
Point to his head.

15:03.821 --> 15:05.770
This is for the fallen Homies, you fucker.

15:06.171 --> 15:07.471
To the count of three...

15:07.670 --> 15:09.198
One...

15:09.399 --> 15:10.699
Two...

15:11.200 --> 15:12.300
...Three.

15:37.294 --> 15:42.005
The first time is like this
little Homie, don't chicken out.

15:43.925 --> 15:49.645
The scareness goes away,
but the gang is forever.

15:52.238 --> 15:57.849
Now you belong to a family
with thousands of brothers...

15:57.969 --> 16:03.993
...wherever you go, there will
always be someone that protects you

16:11.562 --> 16:13.229
Food is here!!

16:31.734 --> 16:33.290
You were not in the "Bombilla" today.

16:34.377 --> 16:36.813
The "Sol" didn't see you.

16:37.009 --> 16:42.709
I was there the whole day,
and I didn't see him neither.

16:44.758 --> 16:47.449
You are not playing gay, right Homie?

16:48.686 --> 16:56.041
It has been many times already,
now the "Sol" didn't see you.

17:01.001 --> 17:02.790
Forget what I said Homie...

17:05.130 --> 17:06.925
...the homies are getting altered.

17:09.027 --> 17:11.827
I love you dog, from my heart.

17:15.662 --> 17:19.429
3 days later.

17:21.148 --> 17:29.205
908 555 0187... again.

17:33.318 --> 17:34.752
we learned it already.

17:35.194 --> 17:36.138
repeat it.

17:36.345 --> 17:37.605
I told you we learned it already.

17:38.429 --> 17:43.269
you have to learn that number, if something
goes wrong, Yessenia can help you out.

17:44.474 --> 17:47.177
Horacio, how much time left man?

17:47.430 --> 17:49.777
Around 6 hours.

17:50.342 --> 17:51.885
Are you tired?

17:52.118 --> 17:53.358
Yes.

17:56.177 --> 18:00.753
You have to see it as an adventure brother,
we are going to an adventure.

18:02.226 --> 18:06.034
repeat the number one more time.

18:21.685 --> 18:28.961
Guatemala-México Border.

18:49.334 --> 18:51.653
Welcome to México.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.621
Your documents.

18:54.710 --> 18:57.470
You don't have, right?
everyone come this way.

19:06.045 --> 19:10.749
First you are going to empty your pockets
and take out everything that has some value...

19:11.014 --> 19:17.094
...after that, take off your clothes and put it
in front of you... start with the shoes.

20:11.108 --> 20:13.251
We walked too much!

20:13.413 --> 20:15.858
We need to buy some water for her...

20:15.925 --> 20:17.581
With what money?

20:25.166 --> 20:28.053
Bring two big bottles.

20:44.354 --> 20:47.954
Your second toe is bigger than the others...

20:48.438 --> 20:50.858
...that means you run fast.

21:04.608 --> 21:06.889
This is what we have walked today.

21:07.097 --> 21:11.622
If there is no immigration
we will be here in two weeks.

21:11.914 --> 21:14.830
- Two weeks?
- Maybe three.

21:17.913 --> 21:20.413
Where is New Jersey?

21:21.281 --> 21:24.237
It's not in the map.

21:25.185 --> 21:31.521
Look, not even half of them will arrive to the U.S.

21:36.645 --> 21:38.869
...but we are going to get there.

21:48.073 --> 21:50.957
Yessenia is not as pretty as your Mom was...

21:51.973 --> 21:54.501
...but she has a big heart.

21:54.765 --> 21:56.806
The girls are beautiful.

22:03.065 --> 22:06.429
Keep it, now they are your family also.

22:06.582 --> 22:08.965
I don't want a picture of your family.

22:11.813 --> 22:16.530
You are taking me in this trip,
and I thank you for that.

22:26.877 --> 22:28.734
I will go call home.

22:44.538 --> 22:48.245
Look at him,
I remember him more handsome.

22:48.353 --> 22:51.753
No, the handsome one in the family is me.

22:56.969 --> 23:01.005
Don't tell me you are not a little happy.

23:01.138 --> 23:03.237
If he was not deported, he wouldn't be here.

23:03.306 --> 23:06.370
- Don't think in that bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

23:53.697 --> 23:55.401
Do you see that train?

23:57.560 --> 24:03.793
That's our train, what do you say if
we grab it and go all the way to Texas?

24:04.425 --> 24:07.825
I can take you to six flags.

24:18.756 --> 24:21.441
Tell me one more time that you love me.

24:22.517 --> 24:24.313
I love you.

24:25.660 --> 24:28.726
Tell me that you won't hide me anymore.

24:30.332 --> 24:31.510
It's not that.

24:31.764 --> 24:33.886
Of course, you hide from me.

24:36.536 --> 24:40.217
You already know all that is worth it.

24:41.833 --> 24:43.797
Martha Marlene.

24:45.698 --> 24:46.598
Martha Marlene.

24:53.661 --> 24:56.690
You think I don't realize what you
do the whole day with your friends?

24:56.933 --> 25:00.617
You get high with other girls,
and fool around the whole day.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.473
Homies you two go to the trains.

25:08.474 --> 25:11.433
Casper, Smiley.

25:11.666 --> 25:13.041
What's up "Sol"?

25:17.085 --> 25:18.897
What's up?

25:20.198 --> 25:21.498
Who is this girl?

25:21.605 --> 25:25.071
Martha Marlene, he is  the "Sol".

25:29.374 --> 25:30.801
Is she your girl?

25:31.418 --> 25:33.781
No, she is just a friend.

25:39.738 --> 25:44.377
We have meeting tomorrow
at the cemetery, in the afternoon.

25:45.518 --> 25:47.217
Be careful, ok?

25:53.473 --> 26:00.153
Hey, be aware Homie,
the entrance is full of "kiddos"...

26:00.854 --> 26:03.154
... who knows who is sneaking in with the people.

26:11.823 --> 26:13.310
I'll take you home.

26:13.469 --> 26:15.721
Friend..... you idiot.

26:16.641 --> 26:19.760
Homie, wait here Smiley.

26:19.961 --> 26:21.061
Wait for me.

26:48.790 --> 26:50.370
Let's go.

28:05.037 --> 28:07.103
There will be no train.

28:07.537 --> 28:10.045
The train went off the rail ahead,
there were many dead people.

28:10.253 --> 28:11.398
Where did you hear that?

28:11.686 --> 28:14.358
Some "Salvadorians" told me.

28:19.773 --> 28:22.834
There will be no train!!!

28:57.349 --> 29:01.690
We need more money to buy the
defense for the homies that are in jail.

29:02.001 --> 29:05.710
finally, some Homies have
screwed up in their obligations...

29:05.865 --> 29:08.349
...and the "kiddos" are getting in the territory.

29:09.849 --> 29:13.686
We cannot allow those dogs bringing
their garbage in the neighborhood...

29:14.065 --> 29:16.754
There will be "cut" for Casper and Smiley.

29:19.101 --> 29:20.017
They fooled me...

29:21.061 --> 29:25.294
...and you know that you cant lie to the leader....
worst, lie to the neighborhood.

29:26.550 --> 29:29.065
Now I want to hear your version.

29:29.916 --> 29:33.018
Where did you go after the "Bombilla"?

29:37.078 --> 29:39.701
Smiley, where did you go?

29:42.525 --> 29:45.501
Ok, your gun.

29:57.485 --> 29:59.398
that's all.

30:00.054 --> 30:03.129
"Salvatrucha" gang, the gang who
controls the "Salvatrucha" gang.

30:19.306 --> 30:20.582
What are you doing here?

30:21.377 --> 30:22.405
You have to go!

30:22.606 --> 30:23.706
Now!

30:24.618 --> 30:27.374
Why? is it a private party?

30:28.330 --> 30:31.700
What's up Casper? who is this girl?

30:31.981 --> 30:33.237
A friend.

30:33.280 --> 30:34.545
From where?

30:34.613 --> 30:37.517
I am from downtown.

30:39.649 --> 30:41.361
Oh, sorry, I confused you.

30:41.469 --> 30:42.781
I was going to take her to the exit.

30:43.326 --> 30:43.978
No.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.485
It won't take time Homie.

30:51.041 --> 30:52.630
If you want I can take her...

30:54.131 --> 30:56.331
...or she can stay and watch.

30:56.569 --> 30:58.817
But you don't go anywhere Homie.

31:04.434 --> 31:06.418
Take her directly to her house Homie.

31:28.457 --> 31:30.889
13 seconds of cut for being a liar.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.490
One...

31:33.354 --> 31:36.050
Two...Three...

31:38.158 --> 31:41.149
Smiley, you also have 13 seconds
for not saying anything against Casper.

31:47.370 --> 31:53.797
This is the largest tree in Tapachula, if you
go to the top, you can see very far away.

31:56.293 --> 31:58.658
Why Willie couldn't come?

31:59.359 --> 32:00.459
Willie?

32:02.514 --> 32:05.264
Do you refer to Casper?

32:09.022 --> 32:13.950
Ohh, I get it now.

32:22.807 --> 32:26.258
You are the reason for him being abscent.

32:27.525 --> 32:32.129
Sit down, I want to talk to you.

32:40.193 --> 32:42.358
Closer.

32:44.459 --> 32:45.859
Closer.

32:50.860 --> 32:53.460
Don't be shy, I won't bite you.

32:56.393 --> 32:57.806
So...

33:01.907 --> 33:03.907
...you and Casper are more than friends.

33:10.710 --> 33:12.878
I have to go.

33:21.598 --> 33:23.694
Has he told you anything about us?

33:28.206 --> 33:36.489
Do you know what are the most
important rules to keep a friendship?

33:39.525 --> 33:46.605
Honesty, respect, and generosity.

34:23.261 --> 34:26.350
hey girl...

34:53.966 --> 34:55.737
Where is Martha Marlene?

34:57.036 --> 34:58.533
She left.

34:59.021 --> 35:00.742
To her house?

35:03.074 --> 35:05.185
The beast took her.

35:14.741 --> 35:16.826
You will find another one.

35:39.981 --> 35:42.654
We are going to make a trip to Tonala...

35:43.442 --> 35:45.417
...you and smiley will go with me.

35:51.705 --> 35:54.730
Homie, one more thing...

35:58.731 --> 36:01.131
...you lie to me again...

36:01.732 --> 36:05.032
... and I will kill you myself.

36:13.777 --> 36:18.053
Horacio, they already cleared the railway...

36:18.122 --> 36:19.894
...the train goes this night thank god.

39:44.715 --> 39:45.986
Give me the money!

39:51.772 --> 39:53.976
Fast, fast!

40:22.964 --> 40:25.228
give me the money!

40:28.550 --> 40:32.069
Give him the money fast, fast.

40:33.118 --> 40:36.038
That's enough!

40:52.712 --> 40:54.217
Turn around!

40:55.923 --> 40:57.065
Dad, Dad!!!

41:46.613 --> 41:48.861
Smiley, get off the train!

41:49.928 --> 41:51.873
but.. Casper.

41:52.469 --> 41:54.412
Get off man!!!

41:58.490 --> 41:59.897
Go Smiley, Go!!!

42:48.017 --> 42:49.977
He is dangerous.

42:51.274 --> 42:52.696
Are you ok?

42:53.258 --> 42:54.952
He is not doing anything to us.

42:56.425 --> 42:58.156
He is a gangster man.

43:00.288 --> 43:02.105
We have to knock him off the train.

44:03.310 --> 44:06.181
Immigration!!!! immigration!!!!

44:25.802 --> 44:28.319
Raise your spawn "Salvatrucha" gang.

44:45.846 --> 44:47.467
Homies...

44:49.968 --> 44:52.668
...we have to talk about Casper.

44:52.981 --> 44:55.746
We should all go and get him at once.

44:56.142 --> 45:00.234
No Homie, water is not ready for beans yet.

45:00.686 --> 45:03.614
Much less with so many fucker around.

45:03.959 --> 45:06.142
They can attack the neighborhood...

45:06.407 --> 45:12.535
...we have to run the voice, even we don't catch
him now, sooner or later the sun will light him

45:13.059 --> 45:14.907
when that happens...

45:18.754 --> 45:22.039
I am not a sissy, that's why I returned.

45:26.246 --> 45:29.407
Then you are lucky I don't kill you smiley.

45:31.403 --> 45:34.723
You seem not to have feelings
for the neighborhood, right?

45:36.975 --> 45:40.983
If you didn't have the balls to kill Casper,
how do I know you didn't help him escape?

45:42.883 --> 45:44.691
That's what happened right, you fucker?

45:44.898 --> 45:46.793
I didn't do anything!!

45:50.611 --> 45:53.448
I will dissapear you from
the neighborhood, you fucker!

45:59.560 --> 46:03.274
Show me you are not a sissy, show me!!!

46:17.246 --> 46:22.527
Send me, send me so I can show you
that I have feelings for the neighborhood.

46:23.547 --> 46:30.219
Send me so I can look for him, and kill him.

46:39.794 --> 46:45.950
Calm down "Sol", hold it, hold it man.

46:52.906 --> 46:54.278
Get going now.

46:55.479 --> 46:58.779
Go and kill  him if you want to stand out.

46:59.835 --> 47:05.142
if you don't kill him, then don't even
dare to come back to the neighborhood.

47:11.698 --> 47:13.910
Son of a bitch, he doesn't
even know where his dick is!!

47:16.587 --> 47:19.459
We have to communicate it
to all the gangsters in L.A.

47:21.571 --> 47:25.067
That dog cannot have even a shadow to hide!!

47:53.179 --> 47:54.699
You going to die.

48:47.914 --> 48:49.747
Thank you.

48:51.559 --> 48:52.851
My name is Sayra.

49:05.123 --> 49:07.592
I am Willie.

49:15.738 --> 49:17.926
He killed Lil' Mago...

49:18.435 --> 49:22.715
...he got warned, there is green light
to kill him, those are the rules.

49:23.659 --> 49:26.582
And how are you going to kill him?

49:30.199 --> 49:35.078
Wow!, thats so pretty! how many you got?

49:35.686 --> 49:38.862
Enough to kill you all.

49:46.903 --> 49:51.794
Kill him but hiding.

50:43.182 --> 50:47.163
Sleep, I will stay awake.

52:51.161 --> 52:56.252
You see, my family is very poor, we barely
had a little bit of beans to eat once in a while.

53:42.401 --> 53:44.412
You are not going to wash yourself?

53:52.492 --> 53:54.494
It feels good.

53:57.783 --> 54:00.237
I don't know, maybe later.

54:03.081 --> 54:05.889
When there is less people.

54:09.604 --> 54:11.921
And what will you do later?

54:13.217 --> 54:14.544
I don't know.

54:23.722 --> 54:25.612
Will you stay here tonight?

54:36.301 --> 54:39.577
If i find food around I will bring you later.

54:46.306 --> 54:48.153
What were you talking with him?

54:48.489 --> 54:49.921
We can help him.

54:50.533 --> 54:54.602
Are you crazy?
we have to stay away from him.

54:54.956 --> 54:56.433
No, you don't understand.

54:58.424 --> 55:00.248
He is a killer.

55:00.688 --> 55:02.624
- He is in trouble.
- I am ordering you.

55:03.380 --> 55:04.849
But he is in trouble!

55:06.133 --> 55:10.741
I don't care about him, I care
about you and my brother Orlando.

55:11.209 --> 55:15.801
Look, we still have a long way to get there.

55:19.081 --> 55:24.981
We have to be aware, we
can't let anyone separate us, ok?

55:46.557 --> 55:48.248
Who is the boss?

55:48.632 --> 55:49.317
I am.

55:52.652 --> 55:54.348
I am Smiley from the Confetti neighborhood.

55:58.764 --> 56:01.381
Who is the boss now in the Confetti?

56:01.709 --> 56:03.449
The "Sol".

56:05.857 --> 56:08.037
we knew what happened...

56:09.838 --> 56:12.138
...are you hungry or thirsty?

56:15.485 --> 56:17.641
Have you ever got into one of those?

56:20.417 --> 56:21.853
...me neither.

56:23.854 --> 56:29.996
In a road heading to Texas, I saw
a factory where they build them.

56:31.669 --> 56:35.061
There was a letter board,
very big, with the world shape...

56:35.362 --> 56:38.062
...and it was shiny, so beautiful.

56:40.748 --> 56:43.449
I wanted to get on it.

56:44.821 --> 56:50.973
when I go through there, I will
see it and it will remind me of you.

56:51.489 --> 56:53.078
If you make it all the way.

56:54.645 --> 56:57.933
I will make it... I am sure.

56:59.381 --> 57:04.496
In Tegus I went with my friend Clarissa,
to my neighbor's house...

57:04.729 --> 57:07.349
...a crazy old lady called Leonor...

57:07.493 --> 57:09.097
...she was a witch.

57:11.117 --> 57:16.578
She told me with scared voice,
you will make it to the U.S.

57:16.738 --> 57:21.741
...but not holding god's hand,
but holding the devil's spawn.

57:28.093 --> 57:32.092
if you come with us, you can show me
the letter board you are talking about...

57:32.852 --> 57:35.265
...we are heading to New Jersey.

57:38.581 --> 57:41.033
They are coming for you right?

57:42.038 --> 57:45.560
I think so, sooner or later they will find me...

57:47.361 --> 57:49.561
...the gang has good memory.

57:51.121 --> 57:52.493
Are you afraid?

57:54.094 --> 57:55.594
To be killed?

57:56.530 --> 58:01.141
No, I live by the day.

58:02.033 --> 58:06.517
What worries me is not knowing
what time and which day they will kill me.

58:10.308 --> 58:13.353
- So you have not seen him?
- No.

58:16.545 --> 58:18.077
He has a teardrop tatooed here.

58:18.261 --> 58:22.733
No, I haven't seen anyone tatooed,
since 5 days ago until now you guys.

58:30.261 --> 58:33.353
Hey, sons of a bitch!!

58:34.001 --> 58:37.644
I know about that guy you are looking for...

58:39.945 --> 58:42.945
...he has a tear drop tatooed here.

59:48.725 --> 59:50.549
Thank you!!

59:58.985 --> 01:00:00.752
We have to get down...

01:00:01.153 --> 01:00:02.253
What?

01:00:02.754 --> 01:00:04.254
We have to get down.

01:00:05.634 --> 01:00:07.225
why?

01:00:07.601 --> 01:00:11.081
In this station, immigration is
always fucking up...

01:00:11.333 --> 01:00:12.913
...and sometimes the police also.

01:00:14.904 --> 01:00:16.620
So what do we do?

01:00:17.177 --> 01:00:21.821
We get down and surround the train fast,
we must be alert!

01:00:44.465 --> 01:00:47.105
Good day for running, uh?

01:00:49.173 --> 01:00:52.189
Me and Smiley will go the other way...

01:00:52.542 --> 01:00:54.545
...we see each other in the other side of the station.

01:01:42.584 --> 01:01:45.145
Hey, what's up, ese?

01:01:45.346 --> 01:01:47.646
The "M", what's your neighborhood, fucker?

01:01:49.547 --> 01:01:51.547
Hey, look at the guy, he is from the other gang.

01:01:57.304 --> 01:01:59.925
Take out your fucking gun Smiley!

01:02:02.857 --> 01:02:07.109
Don't worry Homie, these
guys always miss the target...

01:02:09.381 --> 01:02:11.189
...except this one.

01:03:11.297 --> 01:03:13.812
Where the fuck were you Homies?

01:03:14.312 --> 01:03:16.719
...didn't you hear the gunshots?

01:03:18.529 --> 01:03:22.261
Yes Homie, but we almost catch Casper.

01:03:22.548 --> 01:03:29.576
You left us behind with those
assholes, and.. where is Casper?

01:03:31.095 --> 01:03:32.488
In the train.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.643
I want to take that fucker down.

01:03:37.252 --> 01:03:40.445
Get on, Smiley, you go in the front.

01:06:35.887 --> 01:06:37.840
You are leaving just like that?

01:06:38.563 --> 01:06:39.720
So what do you want?

01:06:39.916 --> 01:06:41.820
Go with you.

01:06:57.121 --> 01:06:59.221
Oh, God! She fucked up!!

01:07:06.232 --> 01:07:08.128
I can't take care of you.

01:07:11.768 --> 01:07:14.416
I am not asking you for it.

01:07:14.952 --> 01:07:18.720
For god sake Sayra,
realize  that I am a dead man!

01:07:19.521 --> 01:07:21.321
...don't you get it?

01:07:23.148 --> 01:07:24.676
Don't worry Willie.

01:07:25.577 --> 01:07:27.277
Everything will be ok.

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:42.224
You messed up, you don't have
any idea about the mess you are in.

01:07:57.612 --> 01:08:00.860
Horacio, Sayra is not here.

01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:15.108
Oh Casper, why the fuck you came here?

01:08:15.846 --> 01:08:18.772
You are just putting me into trouble.

01:08:21.487 --> 01:08:25.212
I can do what you are asking for,
but really, it's trouble.

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:28.662
I have to do some things first.

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:31.163
you guys hungry?

01:08:32.173 --> 01:08:35.095
You can stay sleeping in the sofa.

01:08:36.096 --> 01:08:37.897
Do you guys want to take a shower?

01:08:41.064 --> 01:08:43.764
You are a little one.

01:08:45.544 --> 01:08:48.404
Well, let me see what I've got.

01:08:52.247 --> 01:08:54.408
I thought you didn't have family.

01:08:54.537 --> 01:08:57.428
I don't, she is not my aunt...

01:08:57.948 --> 01:09:00.783
...I used to take people on her territory.

01:09:01.209 --> 01:09:03.104
And she will take us to the border?

01:09:06.072 --> 01:09:07.850
Are you coming with me?

01:09:07.944 --> 01:09:10.348
Let's see, try this on..

01:09:11.549 --> 01:09:13.149
I hope it fits you.

01:09:13.551 --> 01:09:15.087
The shower is over there...

01:09:15.389 --> 01:09:17.389
...but don't get close to the window, ok?

01:09:17.743 --> 01:09:19.692
I don't want anyone to know you are here.

01:09:38.008 --> 01:09:40.787
What are you going to do with the girl?

01:09:42.548 --> 01:09:46.920
I'll help her get to the border
so she can find her family over there.

01:09:49.152 --> 01:09:51.568
And what do you get with all this?

01:09:51.696 --> 01:09:53.080
Nothing.

01:09:55.804 --> 01:09:57.661
Ok, Casper.

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:02.062
Going straight to the border...

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.816
...you know what awaits for you.

01:10:07.317 --> 01:10:09.517
Did you know they already called me?

01:10:10.352 --> 01:10:12.139
And what did you tell them?

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:16.916
Nothing, the truth, that I haven't seen you...
but they called me yesterday.

01:10:23.396 --> 01:10:26.085
You are not going to tell them, right?

01:10:26.349 --> 01:10:28.432
I always do the right thing.

01:10:29.412 --> 01:10:32.212
Maybe she went down to
take a pee and the train left her.

01:10:37.332 --> 01:10:39.272
She left.

01:10:40.673 --> 01:10:42.473
So, we wait here.

01:10:48.933 --> 01:10:50.664
We can't wait.

01:10:52.365 --> 01:10:55.165
We have to go
or we won't get there either.

01:11:22.317 --> 01:11:24.553
Ok, fuck!

01:11:38.933 --> 01:11:39.405
Take this.

01:11:39.517 --> 01:11:40.521
Thank you, aunt.

01:11:40.774 --> 01:11:41.973
Don't thank me.

01:12:10.042 --> 01:12:14.521
"Sol", it's a pleasure to hear you.

01:12:38.865 --> 01:12:40.178
Are you afraid?

01:12:41.205 --> 01:12:45.838
No, if I am with you I am ok.

01:12:50.054 --> 01:12:55.409
The opposite, while you
are with me you are not ok.

01:12:56.349 --> 01:12:59.497
I don't care, I trust you.

01:13:02.714 --> 01:13:04.654
This scar here...

01:13:09.055 --> 01:13:11.755
...my gang sent me to leave
a "chicken" to the border...

01:13:13.565 --> 01:13:20.720
...and in Tamaulipas, a cop started to shoot me...

01:13:22.574 --> 01:13:29.494
...and here, one from the 18,
there was a fight in their territory.

01:13:30.577 --> 01:13:36.842
This scar here is from the night that the
Homies that I have defended all my life...

01:13:39.645 --> 01:13:42.213
...killed my love.

01:13:45.821 --> 01:13:49.705
And I couldn't do anything for her.

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:57.217
Do you still trust me, Sayra?

01:13:59.569 --> 01:14:01.976
We both know what a loss is.

01:14:03.265 --> 01:14:08.505
All that I know, is that my
whole life has been worthless.

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:12.393
And that I can ruin your life too.

01:14:27.849 --> 01:14:36.353
Get off, go away!!

01:14:55.894 --> 01:14:56.954
I love you!

01:14:57.666 --> 01:15:00.161
Come on, say it with more feeling.

01:15:00.885 --> 01:15:04.034
It's just that I love you so much
that I don't even know what to tell you.

01:15:04.282 --> 01:15:06.265
I don't know how to express it.

01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:14.889
if you can measure it with
your hands, how much would it be?

01:15:15.534 --> 01:15:19.665
It wouldn't be possible, I would need many miles...

01:15:20.466 --> 01:15:23.966
...or the whole universe to
tell you how much I love you.

01:17:22.697 --> 01:17:24.505
Get off, you assholes!!

01:17:27.705 --> 01:17:31.537
Hide, hide, hide there.

01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:06.918
Ok, this card is your pass,
it's only valid for 3 nights...

01:19:07.458 --> 01:19:11.638
...then you have to leave to give
space to the people that just arrived.

01:19:11.683 --> 01:19:18.194
You have two meals everyday, lunch and
dinner and please respect the rules in the wall.

01:19:54.686 --> 01:19:59.419
We don't want low life people like
you here, you fucking gangster.

01:20:00.274 --> 01:20:01.297
Not now.

01:20:01.633 --> 01:20:05.410
That's the least, you can't be here!

01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:14.386
Let him go kid, let him!

01:20:24.202 --> 01:20:29.105
Hey, I can't believe that you are here.

01:20:29.553 --> 01:20:31.634
Have you seen my dad and my uncle?

01:20:38.969 --> 01:20:40.325
What?

01:20:40.454 --> 01:20:42.566
Your uncle was deported, and......

01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:51.254
...your father is not with us anymore.

01:22:55.248 --> 01:22:58.565
When we are in the other side,
I want you to promise something.

01:22:59.149 --> 01:23:00.192
What?

01:23:00.396 --> 01:23:04.027
That no matter what, you
will look for your family in New Jersey.

01:23:10.824 --> 01:23:13.940
Now you have to little sisters
that have no father anymore.

01:23:14.893 --> 01:23:18.869
I would be trouble for them,
as I am for everyone.

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:20.820
Not for me.

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:29.396
But you have to help them
in something, working.

01:23:34.797 --> 01:23:36.513
Are you coming with me?

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:38.909
Yes.

01:23:58.787 --> 01:24:00.268
I am looking for a boat.

01:24:00.772 --> 01:24:02.491
Do you want to cross?

01:24:19.639 --> 01:24:20.696
come on!

01:24:28.712 --> 01:24:30.148
I can only pass one at the time.

01:24:30.511 --> 01:24:31.584
The money?

01:24:32.625 --> 01:24:34.375
When we cross we give it to you.

01:25:01.549 --> 01:25:02.708
Go on fast.

01:25:17.756 --> 01:25:19.660
Turn around.

01:25:44.864 --> 01:25:47.259
Hurry up and get in the water.

01:26:14.424 --> 01:26:17.761
No... we have to go back!!!!

01:26:33.053 --> 01:26:34.612
Let me go!

01:26:52.057 --> 01:26:53.347
Smiley....

01:26:57.548 --> 01:26:59.448
The gang is forever, Homie.

01:29:12.211 --> 01:29:14.891
~ My lips became sealed at this moment...~

01:29:15.317 --> 01:29:21.003
~ ...when I tried to say goodbye. ~

01:29:21.257 --> 01:29:23.760
~ and how would my soul be if... ~

01:29:24.404 --> 01:29:27.852
~ ...I will live far away from you. ~

01:29:30.485 --> 01:29:34.028
~ Come to my side, ~

01:29:34.652 --> 01:29:38.340
~ ...come life of my own being. ~

01:29:38.641 --> 01:29:41.868
~ I want to see me in your eyes... ~

01:29:42.407 --> 01:29:47.308
~ ...and get drunk in the breath
that your mouth exhales... ~

01:29:47.569 --> 01:29:49.401
~ ...with the sweetness... ~

01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:54.228
~...natural from your loving soul. ~

01:29:54.408 --> 01:30:00.830
~ That destiny forces me
with pain to let you go.~

01:30:31.756 --> 01:30:37.355
~ Abscent from you I will live woman... ~

01:30:37.452 --> 01:30:43.949
~ ...but you live in my sad heart. ~

01:30:45.332 --> 01:30:47.384
~ Yours is my heart. ~

01:30:48.117 --> 01:30:52.284
~ You are the angel that came from the sky... ~

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:59.147
~ ...to this tough life,
to sweeten my bitter youth. ~

01:31:02.194 --> 01:31:07.253
~ But if there is a disgrace... ~

01:31:07.923 --> 01:31:11.205
~ ...that you die, or I die... ~

01:31:11.715 --> 01:31:15.364
~ ...over there in the sky,
in front of the creator I'll  join you. ~
- A pay call please.

01:31:16.865 --> 01:31:17.865
Sayra.

01:31:29.289 --> 01:31:31.133
Hello?

01:31:34.634 --> 01:31:35.934
Yessenia?
