00:00.826 --> 00:02.059
Hot in Cleveland is recorded

00:02.094 --> 00:04.464
in front of a live studio audience.

00:05.630 --> 00:06.218
Hey.

00:06.339 --> 00:07.776
So how was the farmers' market?

00:07.810 --> 00:08.813
Weird.

00:08.847 --> 00:10.184
In L.A., a farmers' market

00:10.218 --> 00:12.693
means Sushi, pate, and gelato.

00:12.728 --> 00:14.400
This was just a bunch of stuff

00:14.435 --> 00:17.510
grown by farmers.

00:17.545 --> 00:19.919
Your mother called, by the way.

00:19.953 --> 00:23.632
- Oh, no.
- Did you tell her I was dead?

00:23.667 --> 00:24.937
Wait. Whose mother called?

00:24.971 --> 00:28.449
- Melanie's.
- Oh, thank God.

00:28.484 --> 00:29.888
She wants to come for a visit,

00:29.922 --> 00:31.828
and I told her this
weekend would be good.

00:31.863 --> 00:34.438
No!

00:34.472 --> 00:36.746
Why did you say that?

00:36.780 --> 00:40.927
Because I knew this
would be your reaction.

00:40.961 --> 00:44.139
You're fun to fluster.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.681
Oh, come on, your mum's as sweet as pie.

00:46.715 --> 00:48.655
All mine does is criticize me.

00:48.689 --> 00:52.434
I like her already.

00:52.468 --> 00:54.876
At least yours isn't
insanely overprotective.

00:54.910 --> 00:56.916
All my life my mom
was afraid I'd get sick

00:56.951 --> 00:58.456
or hurt or lost.

00:58.490 --> 01:01.500
Halloween--I was only allowed
to trick-or-treat at two houses,

01:01.535 --> 01:03.072
mine and my grandparents.

01:03.107 --> 01:05.313
And I had to wear my
coat over my costume.

01:05.348 --> 01:07.387
And then when I took the candy home,

01:07.421 --> 01:08.726
I had to throw it away,

01:08.760 --> 01:11.001
because there might
be razorblades in it.

01:11.035 --> 01:13.409
From your grandparents?

01:13.443 --> 01:16.085
My mother trusted no one.

01:16.120 --> 01:19.195
Well, in my house, it
was all about my father.

01:19.230 --> 01:22.005
That man is monumentally self-absorbed.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.277
Well,
my--

01:23.312 --> 01:25.351
joy, please, I am not finished.

01:25.385 --> 01:27.224
He's just one of those actors who thinks

01:27.259 --> 01:30.001
the whole world revolves around him.

01:30.035 --> 01:31.038
You
know--

01:31.073 --> 01:33.212
why is everyone interrupting me?

01:33.246 --> 01:36.490
My father and I argued about everything.

01:36.524 --> 01:38.365
The last fight we had

01:38.399 --> 01:42.344
was about whether or
not the gun was loaded.

01:48.133 --> 01:52.347
Two days later, bam-o!

01:52.381 --> 01:54.554
Heart attack.

01:57.399 --> 01:58.769
Oh, my God.

01:58.804 --> 02:02.248
Your parents aren't
gonna be around forever.

02:03.822 --> 02:06.262
Bam-o!

02:08.940 --> 02:11.414
You know, I do owe my father a visit.

02:11.448 --> 02:13.990
And I owe my mother a
son-in-law and grandchild.

02:14.024 --> 02:18.606
I know, because she reminds
me every two minutes.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.112
Well, my mother is coming.

02:20.146 --> 02:22.821
So why don't you just invite
your dad and your mom here?

02:22.855 --> 02:25.029
Oh, my mother would never
step foot in this country.

02:25.063 --> 02:26.501
That's why I moved here.

02:28.944 --> 02:31.686
I could invite my father, but watch out.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.826
I mean, he hits on
everything that moves.

02:33.861 --> 02:36.369
I like him already.

02:38.422 --> 02:46.235

02:47.183 --> 02:50.512
actually, I feel quite
at home here in Cleveland.

02:50.546 --> 02:52.642
When I last played the play house,

02:52.677 --> 02:55.838
I received six curtain calls

02:55.873 --> 02:59.501
and three hotel keys.

02:59.535 --> 03:00.866
You know when I played
honor st. Raven--

03:00.900 --> 03:03.363
it was a little gem called the tempest.

03:03.398 --> 03:05.893
You know, Victoria could
have done Shakespeare

03:05.928 --> 03:08.491
had she not squandered
her talent on television.

03:08.525 --> 03:10.855
She got fan favorite
plaque from tv guide.

03:10.889 --> 03:12.786
Not helping.

03:12.820 --> 03:15.283
She was really very
good on edge of tomorrow.

03:15.317 --> 03:18.513
I don't watch that much television.

03:18.547 --> 03:19.710
Of course not.

03:19.745 --> 03:24.006
It doesn't have a mirrored surface.

03:25.540 --> 03:26.536
Sorry about the drill.

03:26.571 --> 03:27.835
My mom couldn't relax

03:27.869 --> 03:30.465
until she put a dead
bolt on the back door.

03:30.499 --> 03:31.863
So where were we?

03:31.898 --> 03:35.526
Curtain calls, comma, mine.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.256
I believe I set my personal
record at the broadhurst--

03:38.290 --> 03:39.522
ten.

03:39.556 --> 03:40.754
You remember, Victoria.

03:40.787 --> 03:43.017
That was the night I
invited your sorority sisters

03:43.051 --> 03:45.914
to my dressing room.

03:45.948 --> 03:47.479
Yes, yes, I remembered that

03:47.514 --> 03:50.343
to various therapists for years to come.

03:50.376 --> 03:52.506
You girls...

03:52.541 --> 03:56.668
You were just asking to
be robbed and murdered.

03:58.268 --> 03:59.632
Oh, now, can I
get you anything--

03:59.666 --> 04:01.762
some more chips or--or
a cocktail napkin?

04:01.797 --> 04:03.860
Ma, ma, ma, no, we
just want more of you.

04:03.894 --> 04:05.591
You haven't sat for two minutes.

04:05.625 --> 04:07.356
Oh, no, no, no, let me do that.

04:07.390 --> 04:09.254
It's hot.

04:13.151 --> 04:16.678
Mmm, my favorite, hot
spinach and breath dip.

04:16.713 --> 04:19.841
- You look cold. Are you cold?
- No, I'm fine.

04:19.875 --> 04:21.673
I'm going to get you my shawl.

04:21.707 --> 04:25.303
I must say, melanie--
divorce becomes you,

04:25.336 --> 04:28.698
as it has me, several times.

04:28.732 --> 04:31.894
And, joy, you look as lovely as ever.

04:31.929 --> 04:34.026
Oh...

04:34.060 --> 04:35.657
Thank you, Alex.

04:35.691 --> 04:38.320
You look great too.

04:38.354 --> 04:39.585
Oh, thank you.

04:39.619 --> 04:42.714
I like to think I can still
play the romantic lead.

04:42.749 --> 04:45.445
I like to think I had a happy childhood.

04:48.343 --> 04:49.773
Will you please stop smiling?

04:49.808 --> 04:50.839
I can't.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.404
Deep down I feel bad for you,

04:52.439 --> 04:54.135
but everywhere else, I'm just so happy

04:54.170 --> 04:57.831
my mother's an ocean away.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.729
There you are. That's better.

04:59.763 --> 05:01.826
Thanks, mom. Thanks. Now,
will you please sit down?

05:01.860 --> 05:02.992
Oh, of course.

05:03.026 --> 05:06.089
Oh! But first I have to give you

05:06.122 --> 05:08.086
your housewarming present.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.984
Now, I didn't know what you needed,

05:10.018 --> 05:12.580
so I just brought you some sunscreen

05:12.615 --> 05:14.944
and a new rape whistle.

05:16.810 --> 05:18.141
Gee, thanks.

05:18.175 --> 05:22.802
'Cause nothing warms a
home like a rape whistle.

05:22.836 --> 05:26.198
Somebody's getting cranky.
Your blood sugar must be low.

05:26.232 --> 05:29.395
Here, eat some cheese.

05:29.429 --> 05:32.059
Oh, are you still having trouble

05:32.092 --> 05:35.421
with your irritable bowel?

05:37.087 --> 05:40.648
Her sister used to call her "smellanie."

05:42.713 --> 05:47.640
We used to call Victoria "sticktoria"...

05:47.675 --> 05:50.536
Built like a boy.

05:55.898 --> 05:58.494
I'm sorry.

05:58.528 --> 06:02.989
I'm just so happy.

06:03.023 --> 06:05.287
What just happened?

06:05.320 --> 06:07.451
I suddenly felt a chill.

06:07.485 --> 06:11.346
It's almost like there's a
sinister presence in the room.

06:11.380 --> 06:13.110
Good
news, joy--

06:13.144 --> 06:14.875
your mother came after all.

06:14.910 --> 06:18.438
She's my new Internet buddy.

06:22.801 --> 06:24.464
Mother?

06:24.498 --> 06:25.697
Oh, dear God.

06:25.731 --> 06:28.992
What's going on around your eyes?

06:29.027 --> 06:30.690
How did this happen?

06:30.725 --> 06:32.955
Elka video-messaged me back

06:32.989 --> 06:36.284
after you so rudely logged
off on me the other day.

06:36.319 --> 06:38.681
Well, you'd already criticized my hair,

06:38.715 --> 06:40.279
my clothes, and my posture.

06:40.314 --> 06:42.643
I thought we were done.

06:42.678 --> 06:44.541
You know, rejoyla, when you're snarky,

06:44.575 --> 06:48.337
something unfortunate
happens to your face.

06:50.102 --> 06:53.597
She knows. I tell her all the time.

06:57.791 --> 06:59.660
So this is where you two are hiding.

06:59.695 --> 07:01.363
Yeah, I told my mom I smelled gas.

07:01.397 --> 07:03.602
That should keep her busy for a while.

07:03.636 --> 07:04.837
Oh, it's crazy, I know,

07:04.871 --> 07:06.273
but what, my father's
been here two days,

07:06.307 --> 07:07.408
and I'm reverting

07:07.443 --> 07:10.281
to this 12-year-old
needy little girl again.

07:10.315 --> 07:11.818
Do you know I became an actress

07:11.852 --> 07:13.687
because I thought it
would get his attention?

07:13.722 --> 07:14.957
I thought you said

07:14.992 --> 07:18.430
it was because the drama
geeks had better drugs.

07:18.465 --> 07:21.103
I didn't say it was the only reason.

07:21.137 --> 07:23.039
Well, my mom hasn't
let me leave the house

07:23.073 --> 07:24.342
since she got here.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.145
It's my childhood all over again.

07:26.180 --> 07:28.617
She just wants me to
stay at home and eat.

07:28.652 --> 07:32.057
- I was raised like a veal.
- Hmm.

07:32.091 --> 07:35.397
That's better than
being raised by a ham...

07:35.431 --> 07:38.269
Who tries to pork everybody.

07:40.508 --> 07:42.945
I don't know what you
two are complaining about.

07:42.980 --> 07:44.916
Your parents are leaving tomorrow.

07:44.950 --> 07:47.587
Mine's gone viral.

07:47.622 --> 07:49.591
You know, if I thought
it would do any good,

07:49.626 --> 07:51.228
I would tell my father off.

07:51.263 --> 07:53.366
He just wants what he
wants when he wants it

07:53.400 --> 07:55.770
without any regard for
how it might affect me.

07:55.805 --> 07:57.474
Boy, I would just love

07:57.508 --> 08:00.045
to tell my mom how I really feel.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.951
Why do Americans always feel
that spewing their emotions

08:02.985 --> 08:04.955
will make them feel better?

08:04.989 --> 08:07.293
In britain, if we have a family dispute,

08:07.327 --> 08:09.230
we follow a time-honored tradition

08:09.264 --> 08:11.902
passed down from one
generation to another.

08:11.937 --> 08:13.371
What's that?

08:13.406 --> 08:16.746
We get rat-assed drunk.

08:16.780 --> 08:19.550
I'll be back with more wine.

08:19.585 --> 08:21.121
No, no, no. No, no.

08:21.155 --> 08:22.823
No, you do the shot first,

08:22.858 --> 08:25.395
then the beer.

08:25.430 --> 08:26.664
Brilliant.

08:26.699 --> 08:30.539
Wait till I tell the garden club.

08:35.817 --> 08:38.154
Oh, hi, joy.

08:39.792 --> 08:43.297
I'll leave you two. I've got work to do.

08:43.331 --> 08:47.338
These tracksuits don't
bedazzle themselves.

08:51.014 --> 08:52.348
Hello, mum.

08:52.383 --> 08:55.989
Darling, don't slouch.

08:56.024 --> 08:58.060
I'm standing perfectly straight.

08:58.094 --> 09:01.200
And that's just sad.

09:01.234 --> 09:04.673
Speaking of sad, are you dating anyone?

09:06.511 --> 09:08.714
Bye, mum.

09:08.748 --> 09:11.052
Having a bit of a dustup
with the dear old mater?

09:11.086 --> 09:12.354
Oh, you know.

09:12.388 --> 09:16.028
You don't have to tell me. I intuit.

09:16.063 --> 09:18.600
I also see someone
in--in dire need

09:18.634 --> 09:20.237
of some tension reduction.

09:20.271 --> 09:22.674
Here, let's get the ball rolling.

09:22.709 --> 09:25.413
Oh, that's quite all right, Mr. Chase.

09:25.448 --> 09:27.251
Oh, please. Alex.

09:27.285 --> 09:30.891
Mr. Chase is what it says
on my dressing-room door.

09:30.925 --> 09:33.463
Oh, hey, it's my good friend,

09:33.497 --> 09:35.767
your daughter, Victoria.

09:35.801 --> 09:39.107
You have got to be kidding me.

09:39.141 --> 09:42.581
I'll just go drink this on the porch.

09:42.615 --> 09:44.417
Victoria--

09:44.451 --> 09:48.826
daddy, I think it's time that
you and I had a little talk.

09:48.861 --> 09:51.097
- Where's Victoria?
- Having a chat with her dad.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.235
What happened to
getting rat-assed drunk?

09:53.269 --> 09:56.775
It's too late for her. We
can only save ourselves.

09:56.809 --> 09:59.280
I've sniffed
everywhere--no gas.

09:59.315 --> 10:02.119
But I'm a little concerned about radon.

10:02.154 --> 10:03.922
Ma, you can't smell radon.

10:03.957 --> 10:06.294
That's what concerns me.

10:06.329 --> 10:09.267
Why don't you just go
get dressed for dinner?

10:09.301 --> 10:11.471
Oh, why don't we just stay in?

10:11.505 --> 10:12.840
Ma, I already told you

10:12.874 --> 10:14.477
I would like to take you out to dinner.

10:14.511 --> 10:15.713
I made reservations.

10:15.747 --> 10:17.883
But it's getting dark.

10:17.918 --> 10:22.025
And most car accidents happen at dusk.

10:22.059 --> 10:23.494
Ma, you know what?

10:23.528 --> 10:25.498
You got to stop, 'cause
you're driving me crazy.

10:26.701 --> 10:28.604
Oh, uh, I'll just go drink this

10:28.638 --> 10:31.978
somewhere where people aren't.

10:32.013 --> 10:36.687
I think we need to talk.

10:36.721 --> 10:38.958
Oh, my God. My skin is tingling.

10:38.992 --> 10:40.962
- That was such a rush.
- I know.

10:40.996 --> 10:42.632
My adrenaline is really pumping.

10:42.666 --> 10:44.068
Do you think that burns calories?

10:44.102 --> 10:46.974
I feel like it does.
I'm gonna order fries.

10:47.008 --> 10:49.679
First, I told I was upset
because he hit on joy.

10:49.714 --> 10:51.382
And that led to how
he ignores my feelings

10:51.417 --> 10:52.484
and belittles my career.

10:52.519 --> 10:55.457
And then I just went to town.

10:55.491 --> 10:57.327
Me too!

10:57.362 --> 11:00.200
I told my mom no more dead
bolts or rape whistles.

11:00.234 --> 11:01.904
Being afraid is no
way to live your life.

11:01.938 --> 11:03.406
And then I turned it on her.

11:03.441 --> 11:05.677
I said, "for once in your
life, take a damn risk!"

11:05.711 --> 11:09.251
Yes, I said "damn" to my mother.

11:09.286 --> 11:11.054
I said damn too.

11:11.089 --> 11:12.458
I said, "listen, daddy.

11:12.492 --> 11:14.395
"You keep your damn hands off my friends

11:14.429 --> 11:16.164
and start hitting on
women your own age."

11:16.199 --> 11:17.468
You go, girl!

11:17.502 --> 11:19.905
Wait, do people still say that?

11:19.940 --> 11:22.110
No, I mean, drag queens maybe.

11:22.144 --> 11:25.784
But I really appreciate the sentiment.

11:25.818 --> 11:27.754
- Oh, where did you get that?
- At the bar.

11:27.789 --> 11:30.894
- Are you two still celebrating?
- Yes, and it feels great.

11:30.928 --> 11:32.630
You know what? You should
try it with your mom,

11:32.664 --> 11:34.167
because if you don't
tell her how you feel,

11:34.201 --> 11:35.336
she's not gonna change.

11:35.370 --> 11:37.974
I keep telling you people never change.

11:38.009 --> 11:40.112
That's why instead
of confronting my mum,

11:40.147 --> 11:43.952
I've consumed an entire bottle of wine.

11:43.987 --> 11:46.491
- You don't seem that drunk.
- Oh, we English never do.

11:46.526 --> 11:50.365
The alcohol is neutralized
by our bottled-up anger.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.169
That doesn't sound very healthy.

11:52.203 --> 11:54.339
Oh, I'm sure I'll die
well before my time.

11:54.374 --> 11:56.177
It's better than seeing
the heartbroken look

11:56.211 --> 11:58.214
on my mum's face if I did tell her off.

12:01.054 --> 12:04.560
My mom did seem a
little crushed when I left.

12:04.594 --> 12:07.365
Yeah, my dad seemed pretty upset,

12:07.400 --> 12:08.868
and I could tell it was real,

12:08.902 --> 12:10.872
because he didn't use any gestures

12:10.906 --> 12:13.477
or cheat to his good side.

12:13.512 --> 12:15.882
I feel bad.

12:15.916 --> 12:17.218
Me too.

12:17.253 --> 12:21.059
My mom's probably at home in bed crying.

12:21.093 --> 12:23.731
And daddy's probably feeling old...

12:23.765 --> 12:27.104
And unloved.

12:27.138 --> 12:28.774
We should go home and apologize.

12:28.809 --> 12:31.045
Joy, do you need to pay for that?

12:31.080 --> 12:32.581
No. It's free-hamburger night.

12:32.616 --> 12:33.784
I just got it off the bar.

12:33.819 --> 12:37.725
There's no such thing
as free-hamburger night.

12:37.759 --> 12:42.268
Oh, I suppose the missing
bite should have tipped me off.

12:42.302 --> 12:45.574
I guess I'm drunker than I thought.

12:49.283 --> 12:52.053
Mom?

12:52.087 --> 12:55.661
Ma, you awake?

12:55.695 --> 12:57.931
Hey.

12:57.966 --> 13:00.069
I'm sorry to bother you.

13:00.103 --> 13:02.473
I just--I wanted to
apologize about earlier.

13:02.508 --> 13:05.413
Apology accepted. You
were absolutely right.

13:05.447 --> 13:07.150
Uh, can we talk about
this in the morning?

13:07.184 --> 13:09.421
Oh, yeah, sure.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.656
Oh, ma.

13:10.691 --> 13:12.860
Oh, sweetie, you don't have to hug me.

13:12.895 --> 13:15.866
Well, of course I want to hug you.

13:19.208 --> 13:21.143
Is that a foot?

13:21.178 --> 13:25.820
I certainly hope so.

13:25.854 --> 13:28.525
Actually, I've never been measured.

13:33.087 --> 13:34.754
What is going on here?
What are you doing?

13:35.266 --> 13:37.235
Nothing, yet.

13:37.270 --> 13:39.439
No, no. Nothing ever.

13:39.473 --> 13:40.708
You're a married woman.

13:40.742 --> 13:43.680
You're the one that
told me to take a risk.

13:43.715 --> 13:48.289
I meant like driving at night

13:48.323 --> 13:51.862
or eating something hot
you don't blow on first.

13:51.896 --> 13:55.502
I could say something, but I won't.

13:57.306 --> 13:59.776
What's all the noise in here?

13:59.810 --> 14:02.080
Daddy, what are you doing?

14:02.115 --> 14:03.883
Exactly what you told me to do.

14:03.917 --> 14:05.420
Loretta's not one of your friends.

14:05.454 --> 14:06.555
She's my age.

14:06.590 --> 14:10.462
Well, actually
I'm-- - approximately.

14:10.497 --> 14:12.465
I'm sorry. I just need
to not be here right now.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.369
This is unbelievable.

14:14.404 --> 14:16.874
And to think that I came
here to apologize to you.

14:16.908 --> 14:18.476
What's going on in here?

14:18.511 --> 14:22.618
Whoa, philipa, you called it.

14:24.956 --> 14:26.758
How could you possibly think

14:26.793 --> 14:28.762
that this is what I was talking about?

14:28.797 --> 14:32.969
Rejoyla, move. I can't see.

14:33.004 --> 14:37.144
Well, look who's here.
Aren't we enchanting?

14:37.179 --> 14:39.649
Could you at least have the decency

14:39.683 --> 14:42.287
to wait until you're out
of one friend's mother's bed

14:42.321 --> 14:45.459
before you hit on another one?

14:45.493 --> 14:46.962
Certainly move on quickly.

14:46.996 --> 14:49.967
It wasn't an hour ago, you were
giving me the old reach-around.

14:50.001 --> 14:53.741
Maybe if you didn't slap
on the makeup with a trowel.

14:56.546 --> 14:59.685
I'd high-five you if I could.

15:02.390 --> 15:03.692
I'm in shock.

15:03.726 --> 15:07.198
I thought my parents
had a happy marriage.

15:07.233 --> 15:10.605
I thought my third husband was straight.

15:10.639 --> 15:13.978
Well, you see what you want to see.

15:14.012 --> 15:15.313
Psst. Psst.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.350
Over here.

15:18.988 --> 15:21.992
- Mum?
- Elka left me here.

15:22.026 --> 15:23.261
We had a row.

15:23.295 --> 15:25.598
She said you weren't very bright.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.334
And I said you're extremely bright.

15:27.369 --> 15:30.040
You're just lazy.

15:30.074 --> 15:32.278
What's going on?

15:32.312 --> 15:34.214
Well, right now Alex and loretta

15:34.248 --> 15:38.054
are making the walk of
shame down the hallway.

15:38.088 --> 15:41.460
We'll give you four some privacy.

15:41.495 --> 15:45.134
Melanie, I just feel terrible.

15:45.168 --> 15:48.574
I hurt my little girl.

15:48.608 --> 15:50.744
You know what? Maybe
that's the problem--

15:50.779 --> 15:53.282
'cause I'm not your little girl anymore.

15:53.317 --> 15:54.283
We're all adults,

15:54.318 --> 15:57.857
and this is a very adult situation.

15:57.891 --> 15:59.660
So why don't we just
talk to one another--

15:59.695 --> 16:02.131
adult-to-adult.

16:02.166 --> 16:05.471
Okay. Well...

16:05.505 --> 16:10.881
Your father and I haven't
had sexual relations in years.

16:15.957 --> 16:18.896
Okay.

16:18.930 --> 16:21.800
And a woman...

16:21.835 --> 16:24.338
Has needs.

16:27.646 --> 16:29.314
True.

16:29.348 --> 16:33.622
You see, I was merely
scratching her itch.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.167
In other words, you were
taking advantage of her.

16:40.201 --> 16:41.670
No.

16:41.704 --> 16:44.007
I wanted it...

16:44.042 --> 16:46.612
Badly.

16:46.646 --> 16:49.518
Good to know.

16:49.552 --> 16:51.989
Your father won't
even get a prescription

16:52.023 --> 16:54.860
for erectile dysfunction.

16:54.895 --> 16:58.968
Well, that's an issue I've
never had to deal with.

16:59.002 --> 17:01.105
I dare say I had more
encores in the bedroom

17:01.139 --> 17:03.643
than I've had on the stage.

17:03.677 --> 17:06.080
Oh, daddy, really?

17:06.115 --> 17:08.819
Ah, I-I-I'm
sensing

17:08.853 --> 17:11.323
that's one of the "all about me" moments

17:11.358 --> 17:13.861
you were referring to before.

17:13.895 --> 17:16.767
Ma, you know...

17:16.800 --> 17:18.569
I know you're going
through a tough time,

17:18.604 --> 17:20.540
but if you're really
that unhappy with daddy,

17:20.575 --> 17:21.642
you need to talk to him.

17:21.676 --> 17:23.078
You're right.

17:23.113 --> 17:24.848
But you're also right

17:24.882 --> 17:30.291
about me needing to take more risks.

17:30.326 --> 17:35.134
So when Alex came up
behind me and cupped--

17:35.168 --> 17:38.473
oh!

17:38.508 --> 17:41.445
Moving on.

17:41.479 --> 17:44.083
I see you moving to a new city

17:44.117 --> 17:46.721
and going for what you want.

17:46.755 --> 17:49.259
You're so brave.

17:49.293 --> 17:52.331
I wanted to be like you.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.170
Mom.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.578
In hindsight,

17:59.612 --> 18:03.385
perhaps I might have
been a bit more sensitive,

18:03.419 --> 18:07.225
taken your feelings into
consideration a bit more

18:07.259 --> 18:11.365
before I so innocently
flirted with your friends...

18:11.400 --> 18:13.503
And their mothers.

18:13.537 --> 18:18.712
Well, I suppose I
could stay mad at you...

18:18.746 --> 18:20.616
Or I could accept you the way you are,

18:20.650 --> 18:21.785
the way you've always been,

18:21.819 --> 18:24.256
and the way you will be
until the day you die.

18:24.290 --> 18:28.396
But I really do hope
that you live forever,

18:28.431 --> 18:30.534
because I love you.

18:30.568 --> 18:33.607
What a lovely speech.

18:33.641 --> 18:36.245
Yes, I believe you delivered
that to Dr. Stewart Boyd

18:36.279 --> 18:38.047
on edge of tomorrow.

18:38.082 --> 18:40.987
You did watch the show.

18:41.021 --> 18:44.025
I've caught a
few occasionally--

18:44.059 --> 18:46.863
rubbish for the most part,
but, uh, I must say...

18:46.898 --> 18:50.570
Your scenes were quite moving.

18:50.604 --> 18:54.310
Oh, thank you, daddy.

18:54.344 --> 18:57.816
Americans are such saps.

18:57.851 --> 19:00.521
All that emotional spillage.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.392
Indeed.

19:02.426 --> 19:04.195
We're good, right?

19:04.229 --> 19:06.332
Of course, my girl.

19:06.366 --> 19:07.734
Good night, mum.

19:07.769 --> 19:11.575
You're as drunk as I am, aren't you?

19:14.648 --> 19:17.152
I certainly am.

19:28.046 --> 19:30.869
Ah. Good evening.

19:30.904 --> 19:32.697
Couldn't sleep.

19:32.731 --> 19:34.823
Perhaps I'll have some hot milk.

19:34.857 --> 19:35.919
I couldn't either.

19:35.953 --> 19:37.182
I-I wanted to finish this,

19:37.216 --> 19:40.172
but my bedazzler keeps getting stuck.

19:41.482 --> 19:45.302
Maybe I can help. Let me see.

19:48.279 --> 19:49.774
Really?

19:50.189 --> 19:51.674
Do you think I'm just another one

19:51.674 --> 19:53.670
of these silly women who can't resist

19:53.670 --> 19:56.082
your dime-store charm?

19:57.150 --> 19:59.010
My apologies.

19:59.044 --> 20:02.731
I didn't say stop.
