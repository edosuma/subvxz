<i>It's funny the things
that stick with you.</i>

01:10.170 --> 01:13.174
<i>Ever since I was a kid, I've
been fascinated with lists.</i>

01:14.607 --> 01:16.814
<i>Specifically top 10 lists.</i>

01:16.910 --> 01:21.359
<i>Top 10 restaurants, top 10 island
getaways, top 10 stock investments.</i>

01:32.959 --> 01:34.438
<i>Recently,
I read a list of things</i>

01:34.494 --> 01:36.667
<i>most people regret at
the end of their lives.</i>

01:37.931 --> 01:41.970
<i>At the top, "Not spending enough
time with family and friends."</i>

01:42.035 --> 01:43.673
Based on last year's
numbers, we're up 19%.

01:43.736 --> 01:47.309
This is due primarily to increased
assets across the board.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.442
Mr. Reed.

01:50.577 --> 01:52.113
Costs remain flat,
pretty much...

01:52.178 --> 01:54.419
<i>That's when I got the message.</i>

03:03.850 --> 03:06.421
It feels loose
getting in the corners.

03:06.486 --> 03:09.366
Might need to change that right rear
spring or maybe take out some wedge.

03:11.090 --> 03:13.331
While you're at it, check the brakes.
Calipers seem to be sticking.

03:13.660 --> 03:14.661
Got it.

03:16.729 --> 03:19.266
You know, Sam's gonna
make those adjustments,

03:19.332 --> 03:20.612
but if you don't
slow your entry,

03:20.667 --> 03:23.238
you're never getting off that corner.

03:23.903 --> 03:26.816
I slow down any more,
I won't even make the show.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.246
Sean.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.487
It takes guts to
crawl through that window,

03:33.546 --> 03:36.083
but it takes brains
to win a race.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.254
Look, man, if you just wanna muscle
your way around this track...

03:38.318 --> 03:39.524
Rex!

03:42.922 --> 03:46.836
With, uh, arms like these, I could
drive this thing with one finger.

03:47.493 --> 03:49.769
Look at that.
Number one.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.165
Relax.

03:53.199 --> 03:54.576
Fix her up, Sam.

04:01.841 --> 04:03.479
The gates
open at 5:00.

04:03.543 --> 04:04.715
I texted you the directions.

04:04.844 --> 04:05.982
Got it.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.544
I don't know what to
say when I see him.

04:13.620 --> 04:14.894
"Hi," would be a good start.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.362
He reached out to you,
so take the next step.

04:29.502 --> 04:30.674
Hey, Daddy.

04:37.310 --> 04:38.311
Wanna play?

04:38.745 --> 04:39.985
Bet I can take ya.

04:42.815 --> 04:44.817
You think you can
take down a pro?

04:45.518 --> 04:48.021
Sit down. You might
learn something.

04:49.255 --> 04:52.031
Okay. All right.
Challenge accepted.

04:52.659 --> 04:56.630
Just promise me not to, like, get all
misty-eyed when I totally smoke you.

04:57.096 --> 04:59.337
If you're scared, just say so.

04:59.899 --> 05:01.139
"Scared"? Are you?

05:03.036 --> 05:04.845
Now I can show you how
the big-timers do it.

05:04.904 --> 05:06.577
Hey.
Hand it over.

05:08.107 --> 05:09.984
You got a pen and paper handy?

05:10.043 --> 05:12.148
'Cause class is about to begin.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.092
Which one's the go button again?

05:22.388 --> 05:23.731
Time to suit up.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.029
To be continued.

05:32.465 --> 05:34.240
<i>Good
glorious evening, race fans.</i>

05:34.300 --> 05:36.109
<i>This is your announcer,
Johnny Clark,</i>

05:36.169 --> 05:38.376
<i>and it's my pure pleasure
to welcome you all</i>

05:38.438 --> 05:41.749
<i>to what should be
a fantastic day of racing.</i>

05:49.349 --> 05:50.350
One please.

05:50.450 --> 05:51.690
All right, one.

06:00.493 --> 06:02.996
<i>And Scott Hallop easily
takes the checkered flag</i>

06:03.062 --> 06:04.342
<i>in the Crate Late Model beacher.</i>

06:04.731 --> 06:07.644
<i>Followed by Dave Cravett and
John Field in two and three.</i>

06:28.187 --> 06:29.359
Hey, you made it.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.697
Hey, Ray.
Glad you invited me.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.839
I figured it's about time
you saw me in action, right?

06:35.895 --> 06:36.896
Yes, yes.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.138
Thanks for inviting me.
Yeah.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.279
Uh, listen, Ray, I just
wanted to say that...

06:43.369 --> 06:45.371
Hey, relax, Dad.

06:45.438 --> 06:48.146
It means a lot you're here.
Really does.

06:48.908 --> 06:49.909
Hey, look who made it.

06:49.976 --> 06:52.013
Dad, this is Logan. One of my
friends from up in Jasper.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.921
Logan.
Whoo. Mr. Reed.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.119
Jack. Well, good
to finally meet you.

06:56.315 --> 06:57.316
Um...

06:57.817 --> 07:00.593
First time?
Yeah.Yeah.

07:00.653 --> 07:01.927
Well, you are in for a treat.

07:02.655 --> 07:07.502
And you, my friend, uh, you got a jumbo
pretzel coming at the finish line.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.801
Yeah, extra mustard too. All right.
Yeah.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.166
I bet him you'd wear a tie.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.442
Hey, Ray, you gotta go.
All right.

07:15.735 --> 07:17.078
Hey, show time. Um...

07:17.804 --> 07:19.750
Grab some food,
find a place by the fence.

07:19.806 --> 07:21.615
You're gonna love it.
Okay.

07:30.550 --> 07:31.590
You get her running right?

07:31.717 --> 07:32.787
I think she's good now.

07:32.985 --> 07:34.726
I stuck a 250 on the right rear,

07:34.854 --> 07:36.561
raised the J bar,
and I bled the brakes.

07:36.722 --> 07:39.396
And don't worry,
I watched a how-to video.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.732
Perfect, I feel much better about this.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.172
Go get 'em.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.506
All right, now listen, that track is
a lot slicker right now, all right?

07:50.570 --> 07:53.450
So watch your right foot, you don't
wanna be slipping all over the place.

07:53.773 --> 07:55.184
Drive smart.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.385
Say what?
I said drive...

08:00.146 --> 08:01.284
Go get 'em.

08:09.055 --> 08:11.057
He's gonna break my car, isn't he?

08:12.024 --> 08:13.128
Yeah.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.390
Hey. Hey, mister.

08:36.048 --> 08:37.958
A little help, please?

08:39.118 --> 08:40.119
Sure.

08:50.897 --> 08:53.844
Dad doesn't let me wear
my good shoes to the track.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.410
He sounds like a smart man.

08:56.736 --> 08:58.613
I like sitting
close to the action.

08:59.438 --> 09:00.746
But there's a lot of dirt

09:00.806 --> 09:02.843
so you have to scrub a
little bit more in the bath.

09:03.743 --> 09:04.881
That's good to know.

09:06.012 --> 09:07.013
Oh, I'm Gracie.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.886
Gracie, I'm Jack.

09:08.948 --> 09:10.723
Pleased to meet you.
You too.

09:12.618 --> 09:14.723
My daddy's Number 16.

09:14.787 --> 09:17.666
That's how old I have to be
before I can start driving.

09:18.357 --> 09:20.030
Your daddy's a racer?

09:20.092 --> 09:22.368
Well, maybe he knows
my son, Number 73?

09:23.863 --> 09:25.672
<i>We're just moments
away from race time, folks.</i>

09:25.731 --> 09:28.371
<i>The field is stacked with talent
with our own Sean Weathers</i>

09:28.434 --> 09:29.845
<i>sitting in the first position.</i>

09:29.902 --> 09:32.007
<i>But he's gotta feel the breath
of Michael Barrett,</i>

09:32.104 --> 09:35.483
<i>Andrew Radbridge, and Ray
Reed, in the blue 73 car,</i>

09:35.541 --> 09:36.621
<i>your current points leader.</i>

09:36.676 --> 09:37.950
Are the gauges good?

09:38.010 --> 09:40.130
- Getting ready to go green.
- Copy that.

09:41.147 --> 09:44.492
<i>And there it is, folks, the
green flag flies, and it's game on.</i>

09:53.926 --> 09:55.735
Did you bring your earmuffs?

09:56.462 --> 09:57.463
Uh, no.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.566
You're a rookie, aren't you?

10:00.800 --> 10:01.938
Yeah.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.815
<i>Fifty-five laps,
$10, 000 to the winner,</i>

10:10.943 --> 10:13.651
<i>at 650 horsepower,
these cars are...</i>

10:18.884 --> 10:22.297
<i>Sean Weathers in the 16 car
surges ahead of the pack.</i>

10:24.023 --> 10:25.024
That's it.

10:25.891 --> 10:27.165
<i>Whoa, Reed's
right on your tail now.</i>

10:27.226 --> 10:28.546
<i>Look who's making it a race.</i>

10:30.129 --> 10:32.075
<i>You got plenty of room, use it.</i>

10:34.000 --> 10:35.843
<i>Twenty-five to go.</i>

10:35.901 --> 10:37.539
<i>He's eating your lunch
getting off the comer.</i>

10:37.603 --> 10:39.241
Here comes phenom <i>Ray</i> Reed,

10:39.305 --> 10:42.582
<i>who already has three
huge wins in this series.</i>

10:42.642 --> 10:45.213
<i>Looking for a fourth here today.</i>

10:45.277 --> 10:46.585
<i>Top's really fast right now.</i>

10:46.946 --> 10:48.721
<i>Hey, I got him this time.</i>

10:49.115 --> 10:50.822
<i>Oh, no, you don't, not here.</i>

10:51.717 --> 10:53.754
<i>Sean, you got to run
the high line, all right?</i>

10:53.853 --> 10:55.423
<i>That way you don't have to
back the car in as hard.</i>

10:55.488 --> 10:56.796
<i>You'll get your
speed off the corner.</i>

10:56.856 --> 10:58.665
<i>Get it settled down,
Rex, I got this.</i>

11:00.026 --> 11:02.097
He's got this.
He's got this.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.665
<i>Ten laps to go and
there's a battle for first.</i>

11:05.931 --> 11:06.932
<i>That's it.</i>

11:06.999 --> 11:08.376
<i>Hold that line.</i>

11:08.434 --> 11:09.554
<i>Coming up on the white flag.</i>

11:10.970 --> 11:12.711
<i>Got a good spot,
let's don't give it up.</i>

11:12.772 --> 11:16.379
<i>Final lap here, and Sean
Weathers still clinging to a slim lead.</i>

11:20.913 --> 11:22.290
<i>Here they come out
of the first tum</i>

11:22.348 --> 11:23.884
<i>heading down the final stretch.</i>

11:23.949 --> 11:25.758
<i>Stiff anybody's</i> race.

11:29.055 --> 11:30.625
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

11:34.026 --> 11:35.835
<i>That's it! That's it!</i>

11:37.797 --> 11:39.401
Whoo!
Yeah!

11:42.902 --> 11:44.245
Yeah, I knew it.

11:44.303 --> 11:45.907
<i>And the winner of
Saturday's main event,</i>

11:45.971 --> 11:48.051
<i>finally making his way back
to the winners' circle...</i>

11:48.407 --> 11:50.546
<i>Whoo!</i> Yeah! <i>...Sean
Weathers in the Capital 16.</i>

11:51.177 --> 11:52.178
<i>Ray Reed is second.</i>

12:16.001 --> 12:17.036
What'd you think?

12:17.903 --> 12:19.863
Oh, man, this was fun. Are you kidding?

12:20.439 --> 12:22.385
Head up, kid. That
could've gone either way.

12:22.608 --> 12:24.747
Yeah, I'll take a rain check on
the pretzel, though.

12:25.044 --> 12:26.614
You guys take it easy.
All right.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.239
Hey, good to meet you.
Good meeting you.

12:28.848 --> 12:30.589
We'll get it next week.

12:31.183 --> 12:32.303
I gotta hit the road though.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.159
Thanks again for coming.
Yeah. This...

12:34.220 --> 12:36.166
This was great. You...
You're really good.

12:38.991 --> 12:40.868
Thanks, Dad, for coming out.

12:41.193 --> 12:42.263
I'll give you a call
this week, okay?

12:42.394 --> 12:43.464
Yeah. Okay.

12:43.529 --> 12:44.803
All right.
Okay.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.992
But I won today, Owen.

13:06.552 --> 13:07.758
What more do you need?

13:07.820 --> 13:09.060
You won one at your home track.

13:09.855 --> 13:11.163
Big deal.

13:11.223 --> 13:14.432
We're still fifth in points, and
you barely pulled this one out.

13:14.493 --> 13:16.268
We gotta start running better.

13:16.328 --> 13:19.002
Our fans are expecting
another championship.

13:19.064 --> 13:20.304
What do you think
we're trying to do?

13:20.366 --> 13:23.279
Look, I've always supported you,

13:23.335 --> 13:25.008
but if you don't
keep on winning,

13:25.070 --> 13:28.051
I may have to find a new name
to put on the side of that car.

13:28.107 --> 13:31.316
I can't keep this team
together without a sponsor.

13:34.213 --> 13:36.124
I'm gonna go celebrate.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.228
We won, Owen.

13:48.127 --> 13:50.607
Hey, Rex, hand me the
5/8th's wrench, will you?

13:50.663 --> 13:51.664
Yeah.

14:00.105 --> 14:01.106
Coming right up, babe.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.049
Here you go.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.291
No, the 5/8th's.

14:09.114 --> 14:10.923
Oh, right.
I'm sorry.

14:11.617 --> 14:13.460
It's a smaller one right?

14:17.656 --> 14:18.657
Rex.

14:19.225 --> 14:20.670
The 5/8th's.

14:21.727 --> 14:23.035
Oh!

14:23.095 --> 14:26.338
The wrench. Sorry about that.
Here you go.

14:26.732 --> 14:27.852
Are you kidding me?

14:27.967 --> 14:29.446
Okay. Uh...

14:31.170 --> 14:33.411
I'm sorry, babe, was...
Was that not the right tool?

14:33.472 --> 14:34.815
I was...
I was looking for it.

14:39.245 --> 14:40.246
Come on, babe.

14:41.313 --> 14:42.849
Give me a little love peck.

14:44.917 --> 14:46.794
You think you're so adorable.

14:49.688 --> 14:50.826
You know you love me.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.731
Hey.

15:00.132 --> 15:01.805
You raced great today, Daddy.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.737
Thank you, sweetheart.

15:05.604 --> 15:08.676
I gotta go check on the car before Ms.
Sam and Mr. Rex go home.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.821
We got a lot of work to do.

15:10.876 --> 15:13.686
You should be asleep
by now, young lady.

15:13.779 --> 15:14.951
Can I help?

15:15.781 --> 15:16.782
Good night.

15:24.790 --> 15:26.098
You know, that sweet
little girl of yours

15:26.158 --> 15:29.037
is gonna outgrow that couch
before you know it.

15:31.230 --> 15:33.301
You're getting old, man.

15:33.365 --> 15:35.402
Yeah, you and me both.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.714
Can I give you a hand with the car?
No.

15:41.240 --> 15:44.187
You know how Sam feels
about touching her car.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.181
Let's go home.

15:48.681 --> 15:51.025
We'll pick it up in the morning.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.621
Got an earful from Owen.

15:57.256 --> 15:58.428
Again?

15:58.824 --> 15:59.825
Hmm.

16:02.027 --> 16:03.199
I've been doing
this way too long

16:03.262 --> 16:04.639
for some rookie to
come out of nowhere

16:04.730 --> 16:08.439
and take the championship from me.
We've worked too hard.

16:09.435 --> 16:11.176
We're working hard.

16:13.539 --> 16:17.749
Look, Sean, I need you to get
your head straight, buddy.

16:19.478 --> 16:24.120
I need you to stop worrying about
the things you can't control

16:24.183 --> 16:26.561
and start worrying
about the ones you can.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.665
Look, take her home.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.201
You're all she's got.

16:39.665 --> 16:40.837
All right.

16:41.967 --> 16:43.674
I'll head out soon.

16:47.973 --> 16:49.543
Hey, Rex,

16:49.608 --> 16:50.916
kind of tough to
take you seriously

16:50.976 --> 16:53.820
with all that
stuff on your face.

17:18.170 --> 17:21.013
<i>Yeah, the cabin,
Dad, why don't you come up tomorrow?</i>

17:21.073 --> 17:22.882
I'm gonna have some downtime
after I get done in Rome.

17:22.941 --> 17:25.114
We could hang out,
maybe do some fishing.

17:25.411 --> 17:27.584
Sure. I think
I could do that.

17:28.146 --> 17:29.148
Um...

17:30.049 --> 17:32.996
Actually, I could
head up there tonight.

17:33.052 --> 17:37.831
I can stock up on food and bait
while you finish up in Rome.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.528
Yeah. That sounds good.

17:39.591 --> 17:41.127
<i>Um, do you remember where
we used to keep the key?</i>

17:41.193 --> 17:43.332
Yeah, yeah.
I think so.

17:44.129 --> 17:45.130
I'm, uh...

17:45.798 --> 17:49.507
I'm working on something special. I
can't wait to share it with you.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.845
<i>Sounds good, Ray. Looking forward
to spending some time together.</i>

17:53.272 --> 17:56.219
<i>Me too, Dad, Can't
wait to finally catch up.</i>

17:57.076 --> 17:58.350
<i>Well, uh...</i>

17:59.211 --> 18:02.021
Good luck in your race.
And see you soon.

18:13.692 --> 18:15.194
Love you, Dad.

18:16.428 --> 18:17.907
See you soon.

18:31.877 --> 18:33.879
We're here <i>at</i>
Rome Motor Speedway

18:33.946 --> 18:37.655
<i>where Ray Reed, a relative
newcomer clearly making his mark,</i>

18:37.716 --> 18:40.663
<i>and Sean Weathers,
last year's points champion</i>

18:40.719 --> 18:43.029
<i>who's had a less
than stellar year,</i>

18:43.088 --> 18:45.295
<i>are going head to head
again tonight. Hey.</i>

18:45.858 --> 18:47.804
<i>Weathers just
beat Reed at Dixie.</i>

18:47.860 --> 18:49.965
<i>Reed was right on his tail
at the checkered flag.</i>

18:50.028 --> 18:51.974
Reed's lucky he got
as close as he did.

18:53.999 --> 18:57.640
Nice to see you, Sam, thanks for killing
yourself getting the car ready.

18:58.670 --> 19:01.310
I gonna put that rookie in his
place tonight. If even tries to...

19:01.373 --> 19:02.477
Sean!

19:07.479 --> 19:10.551
Hey, sweetie, Rex said he needs
your help outside real quick.

19:10.616 --> 19:13.620
<i>Is sure to involve
these two competitors.</i>

19:13.852 --> 19:16.355
<i>With Reed leading in points, Weathers
is gonna be looking to show him</i>

19:16.421 --> 19:18.162
<i>who's boss out
there on the track,</i>

19:18.223 --> 19:20.635
<i>and that's definitely going
to lead to some fireworks.</i>

19:20.692 --> 19:22.865
<i>We spoke to crews from
Weathers' and Reed's teams</i>

19:22.928 --> 19:24.407
<i>and they say
the cars are ready...</i>

19:24.463 --> 19:27.000
Look, I know this is important,

19:27.065 --> 19:28.745
but maybe it's just
a little too important?

19:28.934 --> 19:31.437
Last I checked it's our job
to be winning races.

19:31.503 --> 19:32.607
What?
Right.

19:33.272 --> 19:34.876
So why are you
making it personal?

19:35.474 --> 19:38.318
It's just a good old-fashioned rivalry.
That's all.

19:38.377 --> 19:39.412
It's healthy.

19:39.645 --> 19:42.683
Sean, we've known
you a long time.

19:43.048 --> 19:44.686
And we've had
a lot of rivalries.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.627
But Rex is starting
to notice it, too.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.362
You've got some sort of
vendetta against this guy.

19:49.454 --> 19:51.525
<i>Weathers had the points
to be champ last year,</i>

19:51.590 --> 19:53.797
<i>but Reed is the talk
of the track this year.</i>

19:54.326 --> 19:56.772
They talk him up like
he's the next big thing.

19:58.330 --> 19:59.741
He needs to be
taken down a notch.

20:01.266 --> 20:02.346
That's what I intend to do.

20:02.467 --> 20:04.208
Sean, you can't...
Look, Sam,

20:05.704 --> 20:06.705
worry about the car.

20:07.906 --> 20:09.146
Let me worry about Reed.

20:12.611 --> 20:15.148
<i>This is a big event tonight.
With the points race heating up,</i>

20:15.214 --> 20:18.058
<i>this race is primed to be one of the
best of the season.</i>

20:18.116 --> 20:21.188
<i>And the winner will surely take
his place in local racing...</i>

20:21.253 --> 20:22.254
Oh, hush.

21:55.547 --> 21:57.993
Hey, June Bug, just in time
for our good luck ritual.

22:00.185 --> 22:02.961
Okay, Millie,
you ready for this?

22:04.022 --> 22:06.798
Your whole life has brought
you to this very moment.

22:06.892 --> 22:09.896
So run fast and don't
let us down tonight.

22:11.530 --> 22:12.873
She won't.

22:12.998 --> 22:13.999
That's right.

22:37.155 --> 22:38.156
<i>Five</i> to go, bro.

22:38.223 --> 22:40.965
<i>H' you don't do anything
stupid, you might win.</i>

22:41.026 --> 22:42.471
<i>Thanks for the confidence, Rex.</i>

22:43.662 --> 22:44.697
<i>Keeping you humble.</i>

22:46.531 --> 22:47.532
Come on, come on.

22:47.599 --> 22:49.272
You got him.
You got him.

22:49.401 --> 22:50.841
<i>Car's loose.
Straighten out the back.</i>

22:53.839 --> 22:55.759
<i>He's gaining on you.
Block the inside on the tum.</i>

22:56.174 --> 22:57.448
<i>No, I'm staying outside.</i>

22:58.610 --> 23:00.248
<i>No, inside. Inside.</i>

23:04.349 --> 23:05.350
<i>That was stupid.</i>

23:05.417 --> 23:06.418
<i>But it worked.</i>

23:06.651 --> 23:10.098
<i>With four remaining, Sean
Weathers out in front in the Number 16,</i>

23:10.155 --> 23:12.101
<i>Ray Reed holding
down that second spot.</i>

23:15.460 --> 23:17.300
<i>You don't wanna tum,
put your rear brake in it.</i>

23:18.029 --> 23:20.839
Into the turn, it's Reed
coming up quick on the top side...

23:20.899 --> 23:22.674
<i>Look out, we've got contact!</i>

23:25.637 --> 23:27.237
<i>Come on, man, don't
let him run you over.</i>

23:27.773 --> 23:30.049
<i>There's the
white flag. One to go.</i>

23:30.108 --> 23:32.110
<i>The front five, Weathers, Reed,</i>

23:32.244 --> 23:34.246
<i>Bradford, Highland and Barrett.</i>

23:36.248 --> 23:37.249
<i>Put the smoke on him.</i>

23:39.451 --> 23:41.171
<i>Oh, he's sliding.
Ease up, ease up, ease up!</i>

23:53.298 --> 23:54.368
Ray!

24:24.763 --> 24:26.834
We're <i>back</i> with
Kevin and Taylor in the Morning,

24:26.898 --> 24:28.673
<i>we've been talking
about what happened</i>

24:28.800 --> 24:30.609
<i>at Rome Motor
Speedway last night.</i>

24:30.735 --> 24:34.205
<i>It's hard to find words,
I think we're all just in shock,</i>

24:34.272 --> 24:36.377
<i>especially the racing community.</i>

24:36.441 --> 24:38.921
<i>I mean, it's not
only a horrible tragedy,</i>

24:39.010 --> 24:41.991
<i>but our own local champion
Sean Weathers was involved.</i>

24:43.014 --> 24:46.223
<i>I think everybody's
still confused and upset.</i>

24:46.284 --> 24:48.924
<i>It's kind of like,
you just want some answers.</i>

24:48.987 --> 24:51.627
<i>Right. But,</i> I... <i>I think you'll</i>
agree <i>the fast thing we wanna do</i>

24:51.690 --> 24:53.169
<i>is start pointing fingers.</i>

24:53.225 --> 24:55.569
<i>Hmm. We just wanna
be praying for everyone involved.</i>

24:55.660 --> 24:59.938
<i>Yeah, man, especially the family.
I can't imagine the pain...</i>

25:24.356 --> 25:25.960
I've been trying to
reach you all night.

25:27.158 --> 25:29.502
Your office said
I could find you here.

25:30.328 --> 25:31.329
It's, uh...

25:33.732 --> 25:35.075
It's Ray.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.424
As Ray's closest friends,

25:50.482 --> 25:53.429
we're thankful for his
intense passion for racing,

25:53.485 --> 25:56.261
but also his love
for Jesus Christ.

25:56.321 --> 25:57.925
And that's why we
gather here today.

25:58.323 --> 26:00.633
Would you please
bow with me in prayer?

26:01.426 --> 26:04.168
And we thank you, Lord, for the
time you gave us with Ray.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.943
Please comfort his family,
friends, and loved ones,

26:07.999 --> 26:10.104
as we mourn the loss
of this young man.

26:10.502 --> 26:13.779
Though we grieve in his passing,
we're thankful he is with you.

26:14.339 --> 26:18.287
And as believers we celebrate that
one day we will see him again,

26:18.843 --> 26:20.914
in Jesus' name, amen.

26:29.788 --> 26:32.234
Pastor, thank you.
You're welcome.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.998
Be praying for you.
Thank you.

26:46.004 --> 26:47.915
He try to talk to you?

26:49.407 --> 26:51.887
I haven't been taking any calls.
I...

26:52.877 --> 26:56.825
I don't feel like talking to family
I haven't heard from in years,

26:56.881 --> 26:58.383
and I don't feel like
talking to any lawyers,

26:58.450 --> 27:01.556
and he's the last
person I wanna talk to.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.655
I understand.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.097
I imagine you're aware I...

27:10.261 --> 27:13.105
I didn't really know
my son all that well.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.809
We hadn't spoken to
each other for years.

27:19.871 --> 27:24.047
And then, when we're trying to be
in each other's lives, this...

27:25.977 --> 27:28.082
Just know you're not alone.

27:31.583 --> 27:33.790
A father should know his son.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.767
Ray loved you, Jack.

27:44.396 --> 27:45.898
He always did.

27:49.234 --> 27:52.306
We... We may not be able
to understand it now,

27:52.370 --> 27:55.044
but God has a plan
through the pain.

27:55.907 --> 27:58.148
I appreciate it, I do,

27:58.209 --> 28:01.122
but I... I need
more time.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.218
Let me give you my number.

28:09.854 --> 28:12.630
Thanks. Sure.
If you ever want to talk.

28:18.930 --> 28:21.843
There's not much I can do but
just come right out with it.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.574
Our biggest sponsor is
pulling their support.

28:24.636 --> 28:27.082
And as much as I'd like
to keep this team together,

28:27.338 --> 28:29.018
I just can't do it
without a major sponsor.

28:29.941 --> 28:32.979
Just tell them you'll
find another driver.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.887
I know that's
what you're thinking.

28:34.946 --> 28:37.017
No one's blaming
you for this, Sean.

28:37.082 --> 28:38.618
Oh, they're not?

28:38.683 --> 28:39.889
Really?

28:40.885 --> 28:43.126
I see their faces, Owen.
I hear what they're saying.

28:43.188 --> 28:45.134
Of course they blame me. Sean...

28:45.190 --> 28:48.000
No, I get it.
I get it.

28:48.059 --> 28:50.403
Never mind the problems
with the car.

28:51.096 --> 28:52.200
Never mind that
he messed up, too.

28:52.263 --> 28:54.766
Never mind that
it was an accident.

28:56.067 --> 28:58.069
But I'm a murderer, right,

28:58.136 --> 29:00.138
because I'm out of
control behind the wheel?

29:00.205 --> 29:01.809
I just don't know
when to slow down.

29:01.906 --> 29:03.283
I'm not saying that.

29:04.275 --> 29:06.482
Yeah, you've been
real supportive.

29:06.544 --> 29:07.989
You've been looking for an
excuse to get rid of me,

29:08.079 --> 29:09.149
and now you've got one.

29:09.214 --> 29:11.421
You have no right to
talk to me like that.

29:11.483 --> 29:12.791
No right, whatsoever.

29:12.851 --> 29:15.331
I've been putting up with your
headstrong attitude for years.

29:15.386 --> 29:17.593
You get to keep on racing
like nothing ever happened.

29:18.056 --> 29:19.694
I'm the one taking
the fall for this

29:19.758 --> 29:22.432
and you're not gonna do a
thing about it, are you?

29:24.729 --> 29:27.835
Sean, I wasn't the one driving the car.
You could've slowed...

29:29.000 --> 29:30.502
You need help.

29:41.679 --> 29:44.489
Sean, you know we're
here for you, right?

30:23.688 --> 30:24.723
Oh.

30:24.789 --> 30:26.166
Hi, Mr. Rex.

30:26.224 --> 30:27.726
Hey, June Bug.

30:27.792 --> 30:30.295
Is your daddy home?
Yeah. Yeah, he's, um...

30:31.296 --> 30:33.071
Go to your room, Gracie.

30:37.235 --> 30:38.339
Sean.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.352
Ten years, Rex.

30:46.411 --> 30:49.324
Ten years I've
been with this team.

30:50.782 --> 30:52.125
I'm dropped like it's nothing?

30:52.183 --> 30:54.720
Without a sponsor
you can't have a team.

30:54.786 --> 30:56.231
What about me, huh?

30:56.287 --> 30:57.595
What am I supposed to do?

30:57.655 --> 30:59.931
I don't know, Sean.

30:59.991 --> 31:02.335
It doesn't have to be
a bad thing, though.

31:02.393 --> 31:05.169
I mean, maybe you can get
your priorities straight.

31:05.230 --> 31:08.973
Look, there's a little girl in
there that loves her daddy.

31:10.401 --> 31:14.042
And she loves saying that
he's a hot shot driver,

31:14.105 --> 31:16.244
but you know what,
she needs more than that.

31:16.307 --> 31:17.513
More?

31:18.610 --> 31:22.888
Angie walked out on us. I've
been doing the best I can.

31:22.947 --> 31:24.153
I'm a good father to her.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.353
Yeah, sometimes.

31:25.783 --> 31:30.163
It's a good thing she's young and that
she can't even tell when you're not.

31:36.561 --> 31:39.201
I didn't mean it
like that, all right?

31:40.331 --> 31:43.744
Look, I'm just saying you
should think about your future.

31:46.971 --> 31:49.451
Maybe a good driver,

31:49.507 --> 31:51.418
he wouldn't hang it up,

31:53.111 --> 31:54.522
but a good dad...

32:17.869 --> 32:21.078
Remember those field day races
we had when we were kids?

32:22.507 --> 32:23.611
Yeah.

32:24.809 --> 32:27.915
It was just a mile,
but I ran so fast,

32:27.979 --> 32:30.823
felt like my heart was gonna
burst out of my chest.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.923
And I won.

32:38.723 --> 32:39.724
First place.

32:41.459 --> 32:43.029
First time I ever won anything.

32:45.830 --> 32:49.869
When I got home, I was so
excited to tell my parents.

32:49.934 --> 32:51.470
And my mom, she...

32:52.971 --> 32:54.541
She gave me this big hug.

32:57.642 --> 32:58.882
My dad, he just...

33:01.379 --> 33:02.414
Sat there.

33:06.017 --> 33:08.429
I was pretty much always a
disappointment to him, I think.

33:11.689 --> 33:12.690
But that night,

33:15.493 --> 33:20.306
he calls me over to him and he
tells me to put out my hand,

33:20.365 --> 33:23.869
and he takes the bottle
cap from his beer,

33:23.935 --> 33:25.209
places it right here.

33:29.574 --> 33:31.144
He looks at me in
the eye and he says,

33:31.209 --> 33:34.588
"Son, most days I
am fed up with you,

33:36.748 --> 33:39.092
"but I am proud of you today.

33:40.852 --> 33:44.527
"That's more than just
a bottle cap right there,

33:44.589 --> 33:46.227
"that's a medal.

33:47.592 --> 33:49.629
"So you appreciate that."

33:55.933 --> 33:57.935
To me, that bottle
cap was like gold.

33:59.971 --> 34:02.577
I put a nail through it, wore
it around my neck on a string.

34:02.640 --> 34:07.146
Spent years trying to
get as many as I could.

34:09.147 --> 34:10.888
How many did you get?

34:11.983 --> 34:13.155
Four.

34:14.652 --> 34:15.652
I got four.

34:20.158 --> 34:21.659
It's over, Rex.

34:23.293 --> 34:24.773
Just go home.

34:25.929 --> 34:28.706
Look, Sean, I'm just
trying to help, all right?

34:28.766 --> 34:29.972
I mean, we're still
on the same team...

34:30.034 --> 34:31.775
No, we're not.

34:33.938 --> 34:35.781
Not anymore.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.853
Sean... You know
where the door is.

34:40.878 --> 34:41.913
Go!

35:50.681 --> 35:53.321
Dad, we need more bread.

35:53.384 --> 35:55.227
It's only end pieces.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.938
Can you go and get some?

36:06.664 --> 36:08.007
Dad...

36:08.065 --> 36:09.806
I'll get some later.

36:22.013 --> 36:25.119
Daddy, my ballet
recital is tonight.

36:25.483 --> 36:27.121
Miss Jenny says I
can still be in it

36:27.185 --> 36:28.994
even though I've missed a lot.

36:31.656 --> 36:33.897
I'm sure you'll do great, honey.

36:33.958 --> 36:35.164
Thanks.

36:39.564 --> 36:42.408
Dad, you have to take me.

36:44.769 --> 36:46.146
What time?

36:46.938 --> 36:49.179
I need to
be there at 5:00.

36:49.440 --> 36:50.919
I don't want to be late,

36:51.008 --> 36:52.919
'cause if you're late Miss
Jenny puts you in the back

36:52.977 --> 36:56.083
and I want to be in the
front so you can see me.

36:59.850 --> 37:00.954
Sure.

37:02.820 --> 37:04.561
We're gonna have to leave early.

37:05.089 --> 37:06.363
For real.

37:08.292 --> 37:09.327
Okay.

37:09.894 --> 37:11.237
We'll leave at 5:00.

37:11.295 --> 37:14.276
No, Dad, I need to
be there at 5:00.

37:14.332 --> 37:16.676
We'll leave
at 4:30 then.

37:17.134 --> 37:20.377
Okay, but...
But promise...

37:21.973 --> 37:23.145
I promise.

37:24.342 --> 37:26.515
I mean, really promise.

37:26.577 --> 37:27.783
Gracie!

37:36.254 --> 37:37.426
Go on,

37:39.190 --> 37:40.726
you'll miss the bus.

37:58.909 --> 38:00.946
Okay, well, the first thing
we're gonna need to do is

38:01.012 --> 38:04.255
to try to make this
place feel bigger.

38:04.315 --> 38:07.159
So all this clutter
and personal items,

38:07.285 --> 38:10.095
like family photos,
will need to be removed.

38:12.323 --> 38:14.303
It looks like you've
had some water damage,

38:14.358 --> 38:18.864
so the roof is gonna need to be
fixed, and the ceilings patched.

38:19.897 --> 38:22.343
And the floors are not
in very good shape either.

38:25.403 --> 38:29.374
The market for lake property
is very valuable,

38:29.440 --> 38:31.010
but like I said,
there's still an extensive

38:31.075 --> 38:33.351
amount of repairs that
still need to be done.

38:33.411 --> 38:36.187
Now, I'd be happy to recommend
some contractors for you.

38:36.247 --> 38:37.624
Oh, I'm gonna do it myself.

38:37.948 --> 38:38.983
Oh.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.586
I'll call you when I'm done.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.690
Okay. Whatever you want.

38:49.360 --> 38:50.964
And curb appeal.

38:51.829 --> 38:54.776
A little cleanup of all this
might not be a bad idea either.

38:56.467 --> 38:58.037
And landscaping.

39:02.206 --> 39:03.412
Thanks.

39:18.255 --> 39:20.667
Doug, you... You know
me, man, I mean...

39:21.325 --> 39:24.306
You're telling me you can't
find something? Anything.

39:24.628 --> 39:28.075
I'll see what I can do, but
I can't make any promises.

41:05.830 --> 41:07.241
This
is <i>Sean</i> Weathers... Dad!

41:07.298 --> 41:09.141
<i>Leave a message and
I'll call you back.</i>

42:16.800 --> 42:19.337
<i>Those
practice laps have been completed.</i>

42:19.403 --> 42:21.815
<i>Those engines finely tuned.</i>

42:21.872 --> 42:24.716
<i>Number 16, Sean Weathers,
takes the track</i>

42:24.775 --> 42:27.585
<i>for what is sure to be
another landslide victory.</i>

42:52.002 --> 42:55.279
Hey, um, which way
is the dance studio?

42:55.839 --> 42:56.977
Um, I think it's that way.

42:57.107 --> 42:58.245
Thanks.

43:03.847 --> 43:06.327
Wait! ls anybody with you?

43:24.735 --> 43:26.476
Miss Jenny!

43:26.537 --> 43:28.346
Miss Jenny, I'm here!

43:40.918 --> 43:41.919
I'm here.

43:49.793 --> 43:52.831
<i>It's time to finish those com dogs.
Hold on to those little ones.</i>

43:52.930 --> 43:56.070
<i>It's time for
the big dance to begin.</i>

43:58.268 --> 43:59.372
Dance...

44:24.461 --> 44:25.667
It's a mess.

44:27.097 --> 44:30.340
But I did find out they dropped
the child endangerment charges.

44:33.037 --> 44:34.072
That's a good thing.

44:37.775 --> 44:39.049
When can I have her back?

44:39.576 --> 44:40.577
Mmm.

44:40.911 --> 44:42.447
Mr. Weathers...

44:43.180 --> 44:45.285
This is by far
the worst incident,

44:45.349 --> 44:48.728
but it's not the first time
we've had cause for concern.

44:48.786 --> 44:51.960
We're aware that she goes
home to an empty house,

44:52.022 --> 44:54.662
and sometimes she
can't get in at all.

44:56.226 --> 44:57.500
It's been a tough year for us.

44:58.362 --> 44:59.841
Okay.

44:59.897 --> 45:02.969
So let's work together
so it doesn't get worse.

45:03.600 --> 45:06.410
You and I will go
over the steps necessary

45:06.470 --> 45:08.279
to be reunited
with your daughter.

45:08.605 --> 45:13.281
I can assure you that Gracie is
in a safe home with good people.

45:13.343 --> 45:15.016
She'll stay there until we feel

45:15.079 --> 45:17.616
that you're ready
to take care of her.

45:19.850 --> 45:21.227
I'll do whatever it takes.

45:21.719 --> 45:23.221
And so will I.

45:27.024 --> 45:28.731
<i>A girl?</i>

45:29.126 --> 45:30.969
Yes, a girl.

45:31.028 --> 45:34.407
And she's been through a lot so we're
all gonna be very sweet to her.

45:35.132 --> 45:36.702
Do we have to share our toys?

45:37.468 --> 45:38.606
What do you think?

45:41.772 --> 45:44.378
Where are you going?
To hide my army men!

45:47.878 --> 45:49.050
We're home!

45:50.981 --> 45:52.517
Just right through here.

45:54.384 --> 45:56.295
Hello, everybody.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.290
This is Gracie.

45:58.522 --> 46:00.126
Gracie, this is
my wife, Christine.

46:00.190 --> 46:01.726
It's nice to meet you.

46:02.593 --> 46:04.504
And this is Jeffrey.

46:04.595 --> 46:08.475
And we've got another one named
Aaron around here somewhere.

46:09.333 --> 46:10.903
You know, Jeffrey's eight.

46:10.968 --> 46:12.072
Almost nine.

46:13.036 --> 46:14.811
And you're nine, right?

46:14.872 --> 46:16.146
Almost ten.

46:16.507 --> 46:17.508
Oh, wow.

46:17.641 --> 46:19.450
Practically a young lady, huh?

46:21.311 --> 46:23.291
And this is your room.

46:24.581 --> 46:27.027
You know, we can fix
it up anyway you'd like.

46:32.723 --> 46:34.532
So, the closet's right here.

46:34.591 --> 46:36.764
And the bathroom is
at the end of the hall.

46:38.562 --> 46:40.599
It... It's very nice.

46:42.065 --> 46:44.505
Hey, why don't you put your stuff
down on the desk over there?

46:47.671 --> 46:50.652
I could help you put your
clothes away if you'd like.

46:54.545 --> 46:57.082
Thank you, but that's okay.

46:57.147 --> 46:58.956
I'm not staying long.

47:17.034 --> 47:20.243
No, you have
to go slow to go fast.

47:20.304 --> 47:22.614
That doesn't make any sense.

47:22.673 --> 47:24.209
Ready, set, go!

47:39.089 --> 47:40.090
Hey, guys.

47:40.657 --> 47:41.658
Lunch.

47:46.864 --> 47:49.208
Where are your priorities?

48:00.477 --> 48:01.751
All right.

48:01.812 --> 48:03.052
Prayers first.

48:03.113 --> 48:05.093
And sandwiches before pudding.

48:07.584 --> 48:08.722
Hi. Come on in.

48:08.785 --> 48:10.196
Hi. Um, I'm a little early.

48:10.254 --> 48:12.495
It's okay. The kids
just sat down for lunch.

48:12.556 --> 48:14.502
Can I get you something?
No, I'm fine.

48:14.558 --> 48:16.560
How are things?
Better, I think.

48:16.627 --> 48:17.628
Good.

48:17.728 --> 48:19.901
More eating, less laughing.

48:22.966 --> 48:25.344
You know, she really
is a sweet girl.

48:25.402 --> 48:26.710
You know, she still won't let me

48:26.770 --> 48:28.147
take the clothes
out of her suitcase,

48:28.205 --> 48:29.912
but I think she's settling in.

48:29.973 --> 48:31.111
That's good.

48:31.174 --> 48:33.245
Now, I was curious
about something.

48:33.310 --> 48:35.017
She's been asking to
go down to the track.

48:35.078 --> 48:36.989
So Wesley and I
were thinking that

48:37.047 --> 48:38.492
we could take her
to the church service

48:38.582 --> 48:40.220
that they have
there before the race.

48:40.284 --> 48:43.595
It may actually be good for her
to go places she's used to.

48:45.455 --> 48:48.197
First, he has to find a
full-time job. Hey, can I keep that?

48:48.258 --> 48:50.204
- And that won't be easy in this town...
- Yes.

48:50.360 --> 48:52.067
Given everything
that's happened.

48:52.663 --> 48:53.971
Thanks.

48:55.332 --> 48:56.538
The reality is that

48:56.600 --> 49:00.343
it may be some time before we're
able to send her back home.

49:01.071 --> 49:02.072
What?

49:02.506 --> 49:04.179
Oh, Gracie, honey...
No.

49:04.274 --> 49:06.982
My dad is taking me home soon!

49:09.746 --> 49:11.248
Very soon!

49:30.701 --> 49:31.702
Hey, Jack, how are you doing?

49:31.802 --> 49:33.941
Hey, Jack, how are you?
Fine. You?

49:34.438 --> 49:36.714
I was just out for
lunch with Anabelle.

49:36.773 --> 49:38.081
Heard you were up here.

49:38.241 --> 49:40.414
I'm glad I caught you.
Yeah.

49:44.314 --> 49:47.557
I have a box of Ray's things I've
been wanting to bring to you.

49:47.617 --> 49:49.563
Oh, yeah,
thanks. Thanks.

49:50.687 --> 49:52.564
You, uh, heading towards town?

49:52.622 --> 49:56.069
Yeah, I'm dropping this stuff
off at the donation center.

49:56.727 --> 49:58.400
You want some company?

49:58.462 --> 50:00.305
Sure, why not.

50:00.364 --> 50:03.345
Um, let me put this in
the cabin and I'll lock up.

50:03.500 --> 50:04.911
Okay, great.

50:05.802 --> 50:07.145
Hey, babe.

50:08.438 --> 50:10.679
I'm gonna ride with Jack.

50:10.741 --> 50:12.482
I'll see you back at the house?
Okay.

50:12.542 --> 50:14.647
I love you.
Love you.

50:18.548 --> 50:20.459
All right.
This is it.

50:20.517 --> 50:22.087
Thanks.
Thank you.

50:23.553 --> 50:25.965
You know, fixing up this cabin's

50:26.023 --> 50:29.300
turning out to be more work than I
thought it would be.

50:29.893 --> 50:32.965
Well, if you can use a hand,

50:33.030 --> 50:35.476
I know some guys
who need the work.

50:36.033 --> 50:39.378
Well, I was gonna do it all myself,
but to tell you the truth,

50:40.037 --> 50:41.641
I could use some extra help.

50:42.539 --> 50:45.577
Then I know a guy in particular
that you ought to consider.

50:45.642 --> 50:47.679
Who's that?
Sean Weathers.

50:49.212 --> 50:50.589
Is this some sort of joke?

50:50.714 --> 50:52.125
No. Not at all.

50:52.949 --> 50:55.361
I'm just thinking
you're hurting,

50:56.553 --> 50:58.863
he's probably hurting, too.

50:58.922 --> 51:02.301
And nobody is risking putting
him back in a race car.

51:03.760 --> 51:05.797
You need help.
He needs work.

51:06.963 --> 51:09.671
Seems like a golden
opportunity to me. Right.

51:09.733 --> 51:11.406
Look, Jack, I'm just saying...

51:11.468 --> 51:15.280
Forgiveness,
it doesn't erase our past,

51:15.338 --> 51:17.147
but it can help
rewrite our future.

51:17.641 --> 51:18.915
Forgiveness?

51:18.975 --> 51:21.353
Look, maybe you're
not there yet,

51:21.411 --> 51:24.949
but the two of you, maybe you can
find some closure, I don't know.

51:25.015 --> 51:27.291
Just... Logan, I
know you mean well,

51:27.350 --> 51:29.159
but that's never gonna happen.

51:29.219 --> 51:30.698
Never. Let's go.

51:51.975 --> 51:53.045
Thanks for the ride.

51:53.176 --> 51:54.246
No problem.

51:54.311 --> 51:55.881
Hey, um...

51:55.946 --> 51:59.018
I'm speaking at the Race
Track Church this weekend.

51:59.082 --> 52:02.222
They're honoring Ray
to start off the new season.

52:02.285 --> 52:04.561
I think it'd be
great if you came.

52:04.621 --> 52:05.964
Maybe I will.

52:06.022 --> 52:07.330
All right.

52:16.700 --> 52:18.338
Did you tell him?

52:37.654 --> 52:38.655
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

52:39.623 --> 52:41.193
<i>Longtime no see.</i>

52:42.025 --> 52:44.335
<i>It really has been a long time.</i>

52:45.228 --> 52:47.208
<i>Nine years now,
! think?</i>

52:48.031 --> 52:52.309
<i>Look, when you left, Dad, I know you
didn't mean everything you said.</i>

52:53.203 --> 52:55.740
<i>We both kind of
lashed out at each other.</i>

52:56.406 --> 52:59.944
<i>I was just a dumb kid, and I
want to tell you I'm sorry.</i>

53:00.310 --> 53:03.723
<i>You know, after Mom died,
I, uh, I needed you,</i>

53:05.382 --> 53:07.589
<i>and you weren't there for me.</i>

53:07.851 --> 53:10.832
<i>I figured it was
only gonna get worse.</i>

53:13.256 --> 53:16.135
<i>I promised myself I'd never
forgive you for that.</i>

53:16.193 --> 53:17.365
<i>But, um...</i>

53:18.628 --> 53:21.973
<i>A few years ago, something
amazing happened.</i> It's...

53:22.699 --> 53:26.408
<i>I don't know, I want to tell you about
it in person, if you'll let me.</i>

53:26.469 --> 53:28.189
<i>But first, I wanted to
send you this message</i>

53:28.238 --> 53:31.947
<i>to let you know I don't hold
a grudge against you anymore.</i>

53:32.008 --> 53:33.817
<i>Forgive you, completely.</i>

53:34.544 --> 53:36.683
<i>I hope someday you
can forgive me, too.</i>

53:36.746 --> 53:38.384
<i>The details are all
in the e-mail,</i>

53:38.448 --> 53:40.951
<i>but! hope you can make it
to the race this weekend.</i>

53:41.017 --> 53:42.860
<i>We've got a lot of
catching up to do.</i>

53:43.019 --> 53:45.590
<i>Jesus, you're the word</i>

53:45.655 --> 53:49.694
<i>And the word is living</i>

53:49.759 --> 53:52.000
<i>Jesus, you' re the word</i>

53:52.329 --> 53:56.209
<i>And the word is life</i>

53:56.466 --> 53:58.946
<i>Jesus, you' re the word</i>

53:59.002 --> 54:02.677
<i>And the word is living</i>

54:03.039 --> 54:05.610
<i>Jesus, you' re the word</i>

54:05.809 --> 54:09.757
<i>And the word is life</i>

54:11.214 --> 54:14.559
Where else would <i>I</i> go

54:14.618 --> 54:18.031
<i>If you and you alone</i>

54:18.088 --> 54:22.594
<i>Hold the words to life</i>

54:22.726 --> 54:24.637
<i>And Lord</i>

54:24.694 --> 54:27.698
<i>Where else would I run?</i>

54:28.131 --> 54:31.340
<i>I'm alive because</i>

54:31.434 --> 54:33.539
<i>Jesus Christ</i>

54:33.770 --> 54:36.944
<i>Your word is my life</i>

54:37.207 --> 54:40.211
<i>Your word is my life</i>

54:40.577 --> 54:46.084
<i>Your word is my life</i>

54:46.950 --> 54:48.122
Hey, mister.

54:49.219 --> 54:50.357
A little help, please?

54:53.490 --> 54:54.833
Look who it is.

54:55.859 --> 54:57.361
Hi, Mr. Jack.

54:57.927 --> 54:59.463
Look at you all dressed up.

55:00.297 --> 55:02.299
I'm wearing my good shoes today.

55:02.565 --> 55:05.205
Today is for praying, not for racing.
So it's okay.

55:08.405 --> 55:12.217
I've never been in an outside
service like this before.

55:13.410 --> 55:16.152
I wonder if God
likes it outside best.

55:17.614 --> 55:18.957
I hope he does.

55:19.182 --> 55:21.822
It's very important
I catch him today.

55:22.218 --> 55:23.219
Good.

55:25.855 --> 55:27.027
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

55:27.257 --> 55:28.429
Good morning.

55:29.292 --> 55:30.828
<i>My name is Logan Evans.</i>

55:32.228 --> 55:35.971
<i>And, uh, as you all know,
last season,</i>

55:36.032 --> 55:37.773
<i>the racing community lost</i>

55:38.735 --> 55:41.579
<i>a very promising young driver.</i>

55:42.205 --> 55:47.211
<i>But! lost a very
dear friend, Ray Reed.</i>

55:50.714 --> 55:54.127
<i>Today we honor his life</i>

55:54.184 --> 55:58.462
<i>as we celebrate the start
of a new racing season.</i>

56:00.523 --> 56:01.900
<i>Let us pray.</i>

56:01.958 --> 56:05.269
If you don't mind,
I'm going to pray out loud.

56:05.328 --> 56:07.638
I wanna make sure God hears me.

56:07.697 --> 56:12.271
<i>Heavenly Father,
we come to you grateful...</i>

56:12.635 --> 56:15.878
My dad's very busy
being a race car driver,

56:15.939 --> 56:19.580
but when he's not, he takes
care of me pretty good.

56:20.310 --> 56:23.223
I know how to skip
a rock six times in a row

56:24.147 --> 56:26.593
and I know how to
put air in my tires.

56:26.649 --> 56:28.322
He taught me that.

56:28.385 --> 56:30.797
<i>To protect each driver...</i>

56:30.887 --> 56:33.561
The bad thing is,
he hurt someone.

56:34.491 --> 56:35.936
And I know he's sorry.

56:35.992 --> 56:38.598
<i>We ask you to be with all of us.</i>

56:39.562 --> 56:42.202
If you could forgive him,

56:42.265 --> 56:45.212
I know he wouldn't be
so sad all the time.

56:46.136 --> 56:47.342
<i>Help us.</i>

56:48.538 --> 56:50.518
His name is Sean Weathers.

56:50.740 --> 56:55.382
W-E-A-T-H-E-R-S.

56:56.646 --> 56:57.784
That's my dad.

56:58.615 --> 56:59.821
<i>Amen.</i>

57:00.850 --> 57:01.851
Amen.

57:09.626 --> 57:11.105
I have to go.

57:45.962 --> 57:49.375
Hi, I'm Jack Reed,
Ray Reed's father.

57:49.432 --> 57:51.343
I'd like to talk to you.

57:52.769 --> 57:54.248
May I come in?

58:04.714 --> 58:06.523
Sorry about the mess.

58:08.485 --> 58:11.159
I was wondering if
you could use a job.

58:12.121 --> 58:14.795
It'd be temporary,
but I'd pay a fair wage.

58:16.993 --> 58:17.994
Uh...

58:19.195 --> 58:20.435
Maybe.

58:20.497 --> 58:21.840
What kind of work?

58:22.632 --> 58:24.908
I'm fixing up
Ray's and my estate,

58:24.968 --> 58:26.413
I'm putting it up for sale soon.

58:27.637 --> 58:30.880
It would need some repairs
done, some stuff moved out.

58:32.208 --> 58:35.052
It'd probably be a couple
of weeks' worth of work.

58:35.111 --> 58:37.455
It's too much for me
to handle alone. So...

58:37.981 --> 58:40.018
And you want me to help you?

58:42.018 --> 58:43.122
Why?

58:44.587 --> 58:46.464
To be honest,
I really don't know.

58:48.558 --> 58:50.162
Understand this, Sean.

58:51.194 --> 58:54.573
I don't think I like you,
I don't know if I trust you,

58:55.331 --> 58:57.106
but the offer stands.

58:57.867 --> 58:59.437
Here's the address.

59:03.172 --> 59:07.052
You don't want to help out, fine,
I'll call someone who will.

59:09.946 --> 59:10.947
Okay.

59:12.181 --> 59:13.182
I'll think about it.

59:14.884 --> 59:15.885
Okay.

01:00:56.519 --> 01:00:58.624
I, uh...
I could use the work.

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:01.296
But I can't afford the gas

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:03.304
to get back and forth from
here to my place, so...

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:07.767
I'll need someplace around
here to stay in my truck.

01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:09.632
Um...

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:12.070
I think we can
figure out something.

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:16.282
Is there a truck stop nearby with a
shower where I can get cleaned up?

01:01:19.642 --> 01:01:21.121
Uh...

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:24.521
I have a room down the hall.
You can stay here.

01:01:25.114 --> 01:01:27.185
No.
No, no.

01:01:28.284 --> 01:01:29.888
I can't stay here.

01:01:30.386 --> 01:01:32.059
It... It would be weird...

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:36.030
And wrong.

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:38.197
Do you want the job or not?

01:01:41.898 --> 01:01:44.174
Come on in,
I'll show you the room.

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.897
Well, I guess we
ought to get to it.

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:44.265
Do you want to... You want to
start on the yard or the roof?

01:02:47.396 --> 01:02:48.704
I'll take the roof.

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:50.367
Okay, guess I'll take the yard.

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:53.971
All the tools you need, supplies,
they're in the bucket.

01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:55.783
Let me know if you
need anything else.

01:03:56.966 --> 01:04:00.106
Just, uh, needed to
get some more nails.

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:03.206
What's this about?

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:06.350
The nails are on the shelf,
not under the tarp.

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.823
Come on now.
She's beautiful!

01:04:09.779 --> 01:04:10.780
Does she run?

01:04:11.714 --> 01:04:13.421
What's the problem, man?
I was just...

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:16.019
Just do your job
and leave it alone!

01:05:25.688 --> 01:05:26.689
Listen, uh...

01:05:27.957 --> 01:05:29.095
About yesterday...

01:05:29.525 --> 01:05:33.166
I'm going to swim to the other
end of the lake and back.

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:38.368
Aren't you
a little old for that?

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:44.977
I think it's farther
than it looks.

01:06:39.095 --> 01:06:40.938
It is farther than it looks.

01:06:44.367 --> 01:06:46.472
It's a good thing you followed.

01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:48.783
You know, I question
your sanity, man.

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:53.686
Well, sometimes you gotta do
something outside your normal routine.

01:06:55.111 --> 01:06:57.022
Like swim across a lake?

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:02.494
When Ray was young it was something
he wanted to do every summer.

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:04.087
Made me promise I would.

01:07:06.322 --> 01:07:09.132
He did it tons of times.
I... I never did.

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:12.062
I left before I even tried.

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:15.732
So as it turns out,
I can't even do it now.

01:07:17.266 --> 01:07:18.540
You laugh?

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:21.776
No, no.

01:07:22.905 --> 01:07:24.282
Not at you.

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:29.915
You just got me thinking
about my father.

01:07:31.947 --> 01:07:34.757
His broken promises
were a little more, uh...

01:07:38.687 --> 01:07:39.688
Never mind.

01:07:40.156 --> 01:07:41.601
No, what?

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:48.071
A man who swears he won't hit
you when he comes home drunk,

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:51.407
and broke that
promise everytime.

01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:57.447
That kind of promise.

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:15.433
As bad as Ray may have had it,

01:08:15.491 --> 01:08:17.493
some people had it worse.

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:49.261
It is farther than it looks.

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:32.839
I'm a big list person.

01:09:33.068 --> 01:09:34.843
It must have rubbed off on him.

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:38.348
I was... I was just...

01:09:40.242 --> 01:09:44.587
I guess he thought that we
could make up for lost time.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:50.185
Sean.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:54.930
I think we've both been
guilty of behaving poorly.

01:09:56.792 --> 01:09:58.499
It is what it is.

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:00.302
Don't say that.

01:10:00.362 --> 01:10:03.741
That's my least favorite phrase
ever, "It is what it is."

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:06.109
I mean, what does that mean?

01:10:06.168 --> 01:10:08.170
Sounds like admitting defeat.

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:10.217
That's what people
say when they're not

01:10:10.272 --> 01:10:12.718
willing to make
something better.

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:20.627
Under the circumstances, we both
have every right to be upset.

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:22.663
I think we can do better.

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:25.289
So I think we
ought to make a pact.

01:10:25.354 --> 01:10:27.664
A pact?
Yeah. An oath.

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:29.828
To treat each
other with respect.

01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:32.470
We've both got our
problems to work on.

01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:35.269
Might as well
help each other out

01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:37.174
rather than tear
each other down.

01:10:37.866 --> 01:10:41.780
'Cause we're both pretty talented
at doing that to ourselves.

01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:42.838
Deal?

01:10:43.939 --> 01:10:45.213
Deal.

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:46.275
Okay.

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:51.586
You know, uh, technically,
you did one of these.

01:10:52.715 --> 01:10:54.126
You swam across that lake.

01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:56.524
I swam back, but, uh...

01:10:57.586 --> 01:10:58.792
I suppose it probably counts.

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:01.599
Hmm.

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:03.364
I suppose you're right.

01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:07.104
Yeah.

01:11:07.162 --> 01:11:08.869
Who knows, uh,

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:09.932
maybe I could help you knock out

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:11.706
a couple more of
those while I'm here.

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:12.768
Yeah.

01:11:13.836 --> 01:11:16.476
Uh, let's try getting
the work done first.

01:11:17.406 --> 01:11:19.249
All right?
Okay.

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:49.870
I bought this car off a widow.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.976
Said her husband worshiped it.

01:12:55.604 --> 01:12:58.244
When he died,
it just sat rusting.

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:08.184
It took her a lot of years

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.730
to get up
the courage to sell it.

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:14.558
Painful memories, I guess.

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:21.071
Ray and I spent an entire
summer up here fixing it up.

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:25.871
We pulled the engine,
replaced all the seals.

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:28.813
Dropped it back in.

01:13:30.305 --> 01:13:32.751
Good father/son bonding...

01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:34.446
When I made the time.

01:13:34.977 --> 01:13:37.890
It sure gave Ray
a love of cars, though.

01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:42.928
When Ray's mother passed...

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:49.993
Well, I just sort of drowned
myself deeper into my work.

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:57.710
Every time he asked me to get my hands
dirty with him, I made excuses.

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:01.346
Finally just stopped asking.

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:08.785
And when he started
talking about racing,

01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:11.825
I told him in no uncertain
terms I thought it was foolish,

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.889
stupid,

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:15.394
dangerous.

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:18.830
It ended up being just one more
thing he could challenge me on.

01:14:20.355 --> 01:14:24.394
He did everything he could
to just do the opposite.

01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:28.707
It just kind of
fell apart after that.

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:32.075
When he turned 18, he moved
up here and I moved out.

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:34.837
It's funny,

01:14:34.903 --> 01:14:37.349
the thing I bought
for us to do together

01:14:37.406 --> 01:14:40.478
ended up being just the
thing to tear us apart.

01:15:10.873 --> 01:15:11.874
Hit me.

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:17.215
Come on, man.

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:21.250
You do realize you go bust
every single time?

01:15:21.316 --> 01:15:22.522
No, I don't.

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:26.890
Okay, maybe I do.

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:30.466
It's the unknown that kills me.

01:15:31.226 --> 01:15:32.864
Ooh, deep.

01:15:33.428 --> 01:15:36.238
Or maybe I'm just
not that good at cards.

01:15:36.498 --> 01:15:39.877
Just ask Gracie how many times she's
whooped me at Go Fish.

01:15:40.402 --> 01:15:41.403
Yeah.

01:15:42.004 --> 01:15:44.280
You've got treasure
in that little girl.

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:48.547
Yeah, I messed up.

01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:56.656
It's not easy raising a kid by
yourself, especially a little girl.

01:15:56.885 --> 01:15:57.886
Hmm.

01:15:58.453 --> 01:16:01.297
I mean, racing, it's a full-time
commitment by itself.

01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:08.332
Man to man,

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:10.001
don't ever let your ambition

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:12.841
become more important
than raising your kid.

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:16.575
Trust me on this.

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:21.214
You hear that?

01:16:24.613 --> 01:16:26.286
Sounds like a pack of coyotes.

01:16:27.482 --> 01:16:29.484
Hope they're not hungry.

01:16:29.985 --> 01:16:33.432
I don't know, but I'm not
sticking around to find out.

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:38.264
We went camping? Yes, that
definitely counts as camping!

01:16:48.637 --> 01:16:50.173
You like eggs?

01:16:51.039 --> 01:16:52.245
Hit me.

01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:55.412
Hey, I got you a job
interview next week.

01:16:55.477 --> 01:16:58.014
Really? Yeah, a client
owes me a favor.

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.390
I'll tell you about it later.

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:02.929
Eat. We got lots
to do today.

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:12.935
So which one is this?

01:17:12.995 --> 01:17:15.305
"Do something crazy
just for the thrill of it."

01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:19.204
Don't think I like
the sound of that.

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:22.843
I don't like the
looks of it, either.

01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:25.549
It's on the list,
we gotta do it.

01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:27.847
Butch and Sundance?

01:17:29.177 --> 01:17:30.417
Batman and Robin?

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:33.086
Thelma and Louise?

01:17:33.915 --> 01:17:35.121
Why'd you ruin it, man?

01:17:35.784 --> 01:17:36.785
One...

01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:38.926
Two...
Two...

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:40.193
Three!
Three!

01:18:56.131 --> 01:18:58.372
Gracie. Phone.

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:02.374
It's your dad.

01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:07.609
Hello.
Hi, honey.

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:08.677
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:10.852
Uh-huh.

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:13.014
Yes.

01:19:13.515 --> 01:19:14.721
<i>Can I go home now?</i>

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:16.421
I wish you could, darling.

01:19:16.485 --> 01:19:17.623
Why can't I?

01:19:18.153 --> 01:19:21.896
Well, there's... There's some things I
need to do before I can take you home.

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:23.930
<i>Like what?</i>

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:27.296
Well, like get a job,
for one thing.

01:19:27.362 --> 01:19:29.035
Isn't your job racing?

01:19:29.564 --> 01:19:31.737
It's complicated, sweetheart.

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:34.610
But I promise you this,
I'm working on it.

01:19:35.303 --> 01:19:37.783
We'll be back together
before you know it.

01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:39.250
Okay.

01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:40.615
I love you, Daddy.

01:19:41.343 --> 01:19:42.947
I love you, too.

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:53.455
Hey.

01:19:54.222 --> 01:19:55.257
Hey, not funny.

01:19:55.323 --> 01:19:56.563
I'll bring it back...

01:19:57.926 --> 01:19:58.996
Someday.

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.164
Jack!

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:04.372
Jack?

01:20:06.168 --> 01:20:08.580
Let's see. Okay.

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:09.809
Hey, Sundance.

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:11.851
Set your clock
to 5:00 a.m.

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:13.408
Whoa.

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:15.418
Don't make me
drag you out of bed.

01:20:16.278 --> 01:20:18.417
Wouldn't you rather do
this one by yourself?

01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:20.224
Uh, no.

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:21.955
Don't be a wuss.

01:20:23.418 --> 01:20:25.762
I'll see you bright and early.

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:27.725
You mean, uh,

01:20:27.789 --> 01:20:29.496
dark and groggy?

01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:52.554
- Come on, now. Up and at 'em.
- Easy.

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:53.922
There we go.

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:55.427
No, no, not there.

01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:57.123
Come on. Trust me,
you're gonna like this.

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:58.960
You like mornings.

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.000
"I like mornings."
You're gonna like them, too.

01:21:01.056 --> 01:21:03.036
You're gonna like this, come on.
All right, I'm up, I'm here.

01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:04.570
Come on, Sundance. Here.
Okay.

01:21:04.626 --> 01:21:06.071
We're just
in time. Okay.

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:08.073
Here. You stay
right there.

01:21:20.275 --> 01:21:21.811
Here. Here.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.563
Thanks for breakfast.

01:21:34.122 --> 01:21:35.567
My pleasure.

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:39.728
Well,

01:21:40.762 --> 01:21:42.264
here goes nothin'.

01:21:42.664 --> 01:21:44.701
Just relax.
You'll do fine.

01:22:05.353 --> 01:22:07.458
Okay, Mr. Weathers,
sounds like everything

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:09.263
has been cleared
with my supervisor.

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:11.736
And I have your start
paperwork right here.

01:22:11.793 --> 01:22:13.602
You'll be driving
as one of our locals.

01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:15.642
That's what you're
looking for, right?

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:17.176
Yeah, that'd be great.

01:22:17.232 --> 01:22:19.234
Good. Well, once the
forms are completed,

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:20.803
we'll just do
a routine drug test

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:23.315
and get you started right away.

01:22:25.173 --> 01:22:26.345
Today?

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:54.770
How'd it go?

01:22:59.307 --> 01:23:01.548
What, you didn't get the job?

01:23:02.243 --> 01:23:03.278
No.

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:05.986
Why? What was the issue?

01:23:06.047 --> 01:23:09.426
Look, I, uh... I appreciate
all you've done for me, I really do.

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:12.063
Okay, let's, uh...

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.794
Listen, we'll just keep
trying something else.

01:23:14.856 --> 01:23:16.699
They didn't hire me for...

01:23:18.026 --> 01:23:19.369
For good reason.

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:21.730
I, uh...

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:24.040
I failed the test.

01:23:24.099 --> 01:23:25.703
Test? What test?

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:28.036
The, uh, drug test.

01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:30.313
Drug test, what?
What in the world...

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:31.442
They're just pain pills.

01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:33.386
It's gotten a little out
of control, that's all.

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:38.081
You've got so much
on the line right now.

01:23:38.146 --> 01:23:39.648
What are you gonna
tell Gracie, man?

01:23:39.714 --> 01:23:41.250
That... That's not...

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:44.786
You knew I was a mess
when you knocked on my door.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.560
You invited me up here!

01:23:46.621 --> 01:23:48.794
I never asked for anyone's help.

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:51.760
You see potential in me?

01:23:51.826 --> 01:23:53.772
I'm not your son.

01:23:55.964 --> 01:23:57.409
I screwed up.

01:23:58.099 --> 01:24:00.204
I can't be someone I'm not.

01:24:01.436 --> 01:24:02.506
Sean.

01:24:04.105 --> 01:24:06.608
Man, we're all broken,
we're human.

01:24:07.308 --> 01:24:09.584
God's been showing me
that in the last week.

01:24:09.644 --> 01:24:10.816
Stop it!

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:13.359
Just stop. Okay?

01:24:13.415 --> 01:24:15.088
Enough of the God talk.

01:24:15.617 --> 01:24:18.894
Even if he does exist, he's more
disappointed in me than you.

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:20.731
Oh, come on.

01:24:20.789 --> 01:24:23.065
Let's not make
this more than it is.

01:24:23.124 --> 01:24:24.899
You just met me!

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:27.037
You think you know me?

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:29.106
I'm nothing.

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:31.635
No, no, I...

01:24:31.699 --> 01:24:34.543
I'm less than nothing,

01:24:34.602 --> 01:24:36.343
and I'm sick of pretending

01:24:36.404 --> 01:24:39.214
like everything's gonna be
fine because it's not.

01:24:41.443 --> 01:24:42.979
It's all my fault.

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:45.786
I have failed everyone.

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:52.130
You, Gracie.

01:24:55.123 --> 01:24:56.124
Ray.

01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:58.496
Ray?

01:24:59.194 --> 01:25:02.175
No, that was an accident, I don't
blame you for that anymore.

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:03.709
You sure it was an accident?

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:06.204
What?

01:25:07.902 --> 01:25:09.472
I meant to hit him.

01:25:12.707 --> 01:25:15.847
I was mad, I was jealous,

01:25:17.445 --> 01:25:19.391
and I meant to hit Ray.

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:22.688
I just didn't...
I didn't...

01:25:25.386 --> 01:25:29.732
Your son is gone
because I'm selfish.

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:32.635
Stupid.

01:25:32.694 --> 01:25:33.866
My God.

01:25:34.829 --> 01:25:35.864
I know it's stupid.

01:25:35.997 --> 01:25:37.067
No, I'm stupid!

01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:40.113
For thinking this
would ever work out,

01:25:41.503 --> 01:25:43.710
for trying to forgive you.

01:25:46.407 --> 01:25:49.854
I had my son back and
you stole that from me!

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:53.452
Get your stuff
and get out of here.

01:25:53.515 --> 01:25:54.550
Now!

01:25:55.717 --> 01:25:56.923
Jack...

01:25:57.685 --> 01:25:59.323
It is what it is.

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:54.418
I tried.

01:26:56.177 --> 01:26:57.656
I really did.

01:26:59.814 --> 01:27:04.058
I thought I was finally doing
something that Ray wanted,

01:27:04.118 --> 01:27:06.029
something that you wanted.

01:27:13.461 --> 01:27:15.031
But not this.

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:18.009
Not this.

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:19.670
I can't.

01:27:19.734 --> 01:27:21.338
I just can't.

01:29:08.076 --> 01:29:09.248
Hello?

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:12.089
Oh, hey there, June Bug.

01:29:13.848 --> 01:29:15.452
How's my girl?

01:29:17.485 --> 01:29:19.590
That's what I like to hear.

01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:22.733
No, I, uh...

01:29:23.591 --> 01:29:25.434
I didn't get the job.

01:29:26.294 --> 01:29:28.638
But you know what, it's okay,

01:29:29.497 --> 01:29:31.670
because I'm gonna find
something even better.

01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:36.037
I'm back here.

01:29:39.907 --> 01:29:41.648
Oh, hey, Jack, how are you?

01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:43.211
I'm all right.

01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:47.652
I... I know it's early,
but is Logan around?

01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:50.161
He's out running errands, should
be back in a few minutes.

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:51.925
You're welcome to
come in and wait.

01:29:51.986 --> 01:29:53.795
Oh, I... I don't
want to be a bother.

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:55.459
Oh, don't be silly.
Come on in.

01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:09.472
Thank you, it's very good.

01:30:12.673 --> 01:30:14.914
So, how's the cabin coming?

01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:16.148
It's almost finished.

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:20.482
Did you just have
surgery recently, or...

01:30:21.048 --> 01:30:22.049
Uh...

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:25.597
I'm sorry, I...
I'm being rude.

01:30:25.653 --> 01:30:27.599
No, no, that...
That's okay.

01:30:28.456 --> 01:30:30.663
I think Logan
wanted to tell you.

01:30:30.725 --> 01:30:32.830
He just didn't know how.

01:30:33.594 --> 01:30:34.732
What do you mean?

01:30:34.796 --> 01:30:38.209
Well, I was in an
accident a few years ago.

01:30:39.167 --> 01:30:42.637
It was very
traumatic at the time,

01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:45.983
but God has used
it in so many ways.

01:30:46.707 --> 01:30:48.277
Was Logan driving?

01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:51.086
No, not that kind of accident.

01:30:51.479 --> 01:30:54.858
We were, uh, out to
dinner late one night,

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:57.522
and on the way back to the car,

01:30:57.585 --> 01:30:59.792
this guy moved in
on us with a gun.

01:31:00.988 --> 01:31:03.525
He looked so scared.

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:06.731
And Logan went
into protective mode.

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:09.539
It all happened so quickly.

01:31:09.597 --> 01:31:13.545
He was able to get the gun,
but not before it went off.

01:31:14.936 --> 01:31:16.574
You got shot?

01:31:16.637 --> 01:31:18.844
It could've been a lot worse.

01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:22.988
Wow.

01:31:24.045 --> 01:31:26.616
Well, I hope
the low-life who did it

01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:28.183
is rotting in a jail somewhere.

01:31:28.249 --> 01:31:29.421
No.

01:31:30.418 --> 01:31:31.761
He isn't.

01:31:32.186 --> 01:31:33.688
No... What?

01:31:33.754 --> 01:31:36.064
Don't tell me they let him go.

01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:39.834
No. It didn't
quite go down that way.

01:31:40.461 --> 01:31:46.935
Logan and I, we actually plead with the
judge to get him a shorter sentence.

01:31:47.401 --> 01:31:48.812
You what?

01:31:49.237 --> 01:31:52.684
I know it doesn't make
sense on the surface,

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:55.778
but we got to know the boy.

01:31:56.244 --> 01:31:59.088
God moved us to use
this horrible circumstance

01:31:59.146 --> 01:32:02.559
as an opportunity
to invest in a life.

01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:04.630
Oh, wow. Uh...

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:07.898
I don't think I'd be able to
even look at him.

01:32:07.955 --> 01:32:09.525
I didn't say it was easy.

01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:12.628
Logan even took a bit longer
to come around,

01:32:13.494 --> 01:32:16.498
but we eventually
grew to love him.

01:32:16.764 --> 01:32:19.938
And he started
coming to church with us,

01:32:20.001 --> 01:32:24.450
he even served his community hours
at the rehab center I was at.

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:25.940
Wow.

01:32:27.008 --> 01:32:28.112
Here.

01:32:28.175 --> 01:32:30.212
Let me show you something.

01:32:50.197 --> 01:32:52.837
<i>All</i> right,
honey, this is the big day.

01:32:54.802 --> 01:32:58.841
<i>One small step for Anabelle,
one giant leap for mankind.</i>

01:33:00.107 --> 01:33:01.586
<i>There you go.</i>

01:33:04.579 --> 01:33:06.422
<i>That's a step, babe!</i>

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.323
<i>That's a whole step.</i>

01:33:11.719 --> 01:33:13.392
<i>I've got you. It's okay.
It's okay.</i>

01:33:13.454 --> 01:33:14.489
<i>I've got her, Logan.</i>

01:33:14.555 --> 01:33:16.626
<i>Hey, I got you.
It's all right.</i>

01:33:16.691 --> 01:33:17.692
<i>Thank you, Ray.</i>

01:33:17.758 --> 01:33:19.169
<i>Just keep stepping.
You're doing great.</i>

01:33:19.226 --> 01:33:21.186
<i>You're doing good, babe.
You're doing good.</i>

01:33:21.596 --> 01:33:22.836
Awesome.

01:33:24.398 --> 01:33:25.934
Careful. It's <i>all</i> right.

01:33:27.034 --> 01:33:28.035
Yeah.

01:33:31.472 --> 01:33:33.474
<i>You good? You wanna tum around?
Yes.</i>

01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:35.077
<i>All right. You're doing good.
Yes...</i>

01:33:35.610 --> 01:33:38.352
He didn't get a chance
to tell you how we met.

01:33:38.679 --> 01:33:41.216
<i>Nice and easy. Nice and easy.
You're doing great.</i>

01:33:41.282 --> 01:33:42.659
That's Ray.

01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:44.219
That's my son.

01:33:44.585 --> 01:33:45.723
<i>A</i> few more.

01:33:45.786 --> 01:33:46.890
He shot you?

01:33:47.722 --> 01:33:49.167
He did that?

01:33:49.223 --> 01:33:51.328
- Yeah.
- Just take your <i>time.</i>

01:33:51.392 --> 01:33:55.272
But if that's the part of the
story you're focusing on,

01:33:55.329 --> 01:33:56.774
you're missing the point.

01:33:57.498 --> 01:34:00.069
Don't you see the beauty
of what's happened?

01:34:00.134 --> 01:34:02.273
When we forgave Ray,

01:34:02.336 --> 01:34:03.906
God used it for good.

01:34:04.772 --> 01:34:06.274
<i>[got you.</i>

01:34:08.809 --> 01:34:11.619
<i>That a girl.</i>

01:34:12.013 --> 01:34:14.133
<i>- Just a few more. Just a few more.
- Okay.</i>

01:34:14.248 --> 01:34:15.852
<i>Almost there.</i>

01:34:16.050 --> 01:34:17.723
He didn't deserve it.

01:34:17.918 --> 01:34:18.919
<i>Just a couple.</i>

01:34:19.353 --> 01:34:21.390
Well, neither did we
when Christ died for us.

01:34:21.922 --> 01:34:24.698
Please, just be real for me!

01:34:24.759 --> 01:34:27.103
This is my son
you're talking about.

01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:28.970
So, that's not real?

01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:31.442
<i>There you go. There you go.
There we go.</i>

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:34.677
You <i>made</i> it. Yes.

01:34:35.169 --> 01:34:37.740
Ray didn't
deserve our forgiveness.

01:34:38.439 --> 01:34:40.942
You didn't deserve
his forgiveness.

01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:44.918
And we didn't deserve
God's forgiveness.

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:47.593
Are you starting to
see a pattern here?

01:34:47.648 --> 01:34:48.786
I couldn't do that.

01:34:48.849 --> 01:34:50.453
I... I could never do that.

01:34:50.885 --> 01:34:54.924
We're sinners separated
from a Holy God,

01:34:55.823 --> 01:34:59.293
and there's nothing we can
do by ourselves to fix that.

01:35:00.194 --> 01:35:05.439
And yet, he provided a way for
us through his son on the cross.

01:35:06.734 --> 01:35:08.236
That's right.

01:35:09.203 --> 01:35:13.948
Not because we deserve it,
not because we're good,

01:35:14.008 --> 01:35:15.988
but because he loves us.

01:35:16.410 --> 01:35:18.117
It's tough,

01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:23.592
but when you understand
what you've been forgiven of,

01:35:24.151 --> 01:35:26.893
you can't help but
follow his example.

01:35:27.321 --> 01:35:29.323
We reached out to Ray,

01:35:31.258 --> 01:35:34.432
and God turned around
and gave us a best friend.

01:35:36.797 --> 01:35:39.505
And that let Ray
know that he was

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.547
holding unforgiveness
against his father.

01:35:46.707 --> 01:35:49.415
Forgiveness
didn't erase his past,

01:35:50.511 --> 01:35:53.390
but it helped us
rewrite our future.

01:36:05.459 --> 01:36:06.995
<i>Thank you, Ray.</i>

01:37:06.687 --> 01:37:08.428
He's ready for you.

01:37:24.104 --> 01:37:27.847
Thanks, Michelle. Go ahead
and take the rest of the day off.

01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:31.246
Thanks for agreeing
to meet with me.

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:35.021
Where is everyone?

01:37:35.082 --> 01:37:37.926
Oh, I gave them the day off,
they were due.

01:37:40.821 --> 01:37:42.562
Look, Jack, I, uh...

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:48.496
I just want you to
know that I'm sorry.

01:37:49.663 --> 01:37:51.301
About everything. I...

01:37:54.301 --> 01:37:57.771
I had my attorneys draw up
these papers yesterday.

01:38:01.408 --> 01:38:03.149
What's this?

01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:06.589
It's the deed to the cabin.
It's yours now.

01:38:09.283 --> 01:38:12.230
I figure you and Gracie
can use it more than I.

01:38:15.356 --> 01:38:16.733
But I'm...

01:38:18.626 --> 01:38:19.866
Why?

01:38:20.461 --> 01:38:24.273
I mean, after
everything I've done?

01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:26.743
That's... That's
all in the past.

01:38:27.568 --> 01:38:29.479
We both had a pretty rough year.

01:38:30.471 --> 01:38:34.385
And I apologize for
reacting the way I did.

01:38:36.944 --> 01:38:39.015
You're apologizing to me?

01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:40.353
Yes.

01:38:40.414 --> 01:38:43.224
I hope you'll find it in
your heart to forgive me.

01:38:44.351 --> 01:38:45.853
Are you on drugs?

01:38:48.155 --> 01:38:50.260
Not unless caffeine counts.

01:38:53.694 --> 01:38:56.698
You know, you and I,
we're not so different.

01:38:57.865 --> 01:39:04.180
I... I built a career taking
risks with other people's money.

01:39:05.906 --> 01:39:08.648
Some days, I make them rich,
some days, not so much,

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:10.382
but that's the job.
I don't...

01:39:10.444 --> 01:39:14.551
I don't beat myself up
at every drop on the market.

01:39:16.216 --> 01:39:18.924
Life wasn't meant
to be lived that way.

01:39:24.191 --> 01:39:28.071
Sean, you've worked so hard
to become a champion,

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:32.908
believing that you're only as
good as your last performance.

01:39:32.967 --> 01:39:39.213
Well, just think about what it might
be like to let go of that control,

01:39:39.273 --> 01:39:41.810
let someone else
carry your burdens.

01:39:42.376 --> 01:39:46.415
I found out that that's
all it took, surrender.

01:39:47.214 --> 01:39:48.716
Just giving it up to God.

01:39:50.050 --> 01:39:52.360
God loves you.

01:39:52.419 --> 01:39:55.730
He will forgive you no matter
how many times you fail.

01:39:55.956 --> 01:39:58.493
All you have to do is ask.

01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:02.638
That's what a good father does.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.947
You'll never know how
much this means to me.

01:40:10.704 --> 01:40:13.708
You've given me a chance
to be a better man.

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:17.447
A better father.

01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:22.485
Thank you, Jack.

01:40:36.330 --> 01:40:38.401
You know, I was thinking,

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:42.112
there's still one
thing left on that list.

01:40:44.371 --> 01:40:45.748
Yeah.

01:40:45.806 --> 01:40:46.910
Yeah.

01:41:43.363 --> 01:41:45.309
Hey, Sam, Rex.

01:41:48.068 --> 01:41:50.708
I'm sorry.
Garage is closed.

01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:52.717
Team members only.

01:41:54.108 --> 01:41:55.519
Can we talk?

01:41:59.446 --> 01:42:00.516
Uh, that's fine.

01:42:00.581 --> 01:42:01.992
Look, just...

01:42:02.549 --> 01:42:04.551
Just let me get this out.

01:42:06.587 --> 01:42:07.657
I messed up.

01:42:08.489 --> 01:42:11.060
I know you two were
just looking out for me.

01:42:11.658 --> 01:42:14.502
I never appreciated
your hard work and I...

01:42:14.561 --> 01:42:19.271
I definitely didn't listen to
your advice, on or off the track.

01:42:20.734 --> 01:42:22.145
Maybe that's too little,
too late,

01:42:22.202 --> 01:42:25.581
and if that's the case,
I wouldn't blame you.

01:42:27.574 --> 01:42:29.576
I needed to say it
just the same.

01:42:32.779 --> 01:42:34.087
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:42:34.148 --> 01:42:35.957
Did you actually say anything?

01:42:36.016 --> 01:42:37.427
'Cause, Sam, did you
hear something?

01:42:37.484 --> 01:42:40.829
'Cause I don't think I heard what I
thought I was gonna hear, but...

01:42:40.888 --> 01:42:42.390
Right. Right.
I, uh...

01:42:42.456 --> 01:42:44.458
I didn't actually say it.

01:42:44.558 --> 01:42:45.559
Um...

01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:49.472
I'm really, really sorry.

01:42:51.465 --> 01:42:53.274
I was a lousy friend.

01:42:55.235 --> 01:42:58.307
Spending the last few weeks
with Ray Reed's dad

01:42:58.372 --> 01:43:02.946
has changed my perspective
on just about everything.

01:43:03.744 --> 01:43:07.453
Just trying to make things right
with the people I've hurt.

01:43:10.817 --> 01:43:12.626
So, how is Gracie?

01:43:12.686 --> 01:43:14.165
I get her back today.

01:43:14.221 --> 01:43:15.791
Sean, that's so wonderful!
Thank you.

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:18.166
We're so happy for both of you.

01:43:19.226 --> 01:43:21.399
That's... That's great, man.

01:43:23.163 --> 01:43:25.507
Well, I guess I better take off.

01:43:25.966 --> 01:43:28.469
It's... It's good to
see you. Both of you.

01:43:37.744 --> 01:43:39.087
Hey, Sean!

01:43:41.448 --> 01:43:43.086
I can't take you
seriously with all that

01:43:43.150 --> 01:43:46.495
mushy emotional stuff
on your face, buddy.

01:43:47.221 --> 01:43:49.064
I'll see you at
the track with June Bug?

01:43:50.624 --> 01:43:51.762
Yeah.

01:44:01.001 --> 01:44:02.708
Are you ready, sweetie?

01:44:04.404 --> 01:44:06.315
Hey, what's the matter?

01:44:06.707 --> 01:44:08.618
Just a little nervous?

01:44:09.209 --> 01:44:10.347
No.

01:44:10.410 --> 01:44:13.584
I'm so excited
Daddy's taking me home.

01:44:13.647 --> 01:44:15.524
I've missed him a lot.

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:18.293
But now...

01:44:19.052 --> 01:44:21.032
Now, I'm gonna miss you.

01:44:23.323 --> 01:44:25.929
Hey, look at me.

01:44:27.527 --> 01:44:29.768
You've just been an absolute joy

01:44:30.564 --> 01:44:33.044
and blessing to
our whole family,

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:35.046
and I mean to all of us.

01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:42.043
You know, I believe that God has
got great big plans for you.

01:44:42.175 --> 01:44:46.590
He carved a special place just for
you, right here in our family.

01:44:46.647 --> 01:44:50.060
So, I am not going to let you
walk out that door

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:53.462
without knowing just
how much we love you.

01:44:54.221 --> 01:44:55.825
We always will.

01:45:01.728 --> 01:45:04.766
He's here!
Gracie's dad's here!

01:45:04.831 --> 01:45:06.504
Did you hear that?

01:45:06.566 --> 01:45:08.375
Let's go say hey to your daddy.

01:45:08.435 --> 01:45:09.436
Okay.

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.937
Hi, Daddy.

01:45:35.762 --> 01:45:37.173
Hey, darlin'.

01:45:37.564 --> 01:45:41.011
These, uh...
These flowers are for you.

01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:43.341
Daddy?

01:45:43.804 --> 01:45:45.147
Yes, baby?

01:45:45.205 --> 01:45:47.481
I've been talking
with God a lot lately.

01:45:48.175 --> 01:45:49.279
Yeah?

01:45:49.343 --> 01:45:53.052
I asked him to help you get better,
and not be so sad anymore.

01:45:55.916 --> 01:45:57.589
Are you still sad?

01:45:58.518 --> 01:45:59.588
No.

01:46:00.253 --> 01:46:01.630
No, I...

01:46:01.688 --> 01:46:03.759
I'm really, really happy.

01:46:05.225 --> 01:46:07.034
I'm just so thankful for you.

01:46:07.694 --> 01:46:10.300
And I've missed my
little girl a whole bunch.

01:46:10.597 --> 01:46:13.077
Do you think that

01:46:13.133 --> 01:46:14.737
you could forgive me?

01:46:15.402 --> 01:46:16.472
Yes.

01:46:20.507 --> 01:46:22.487
I've missed you so much.

01:46:23.110 --> 01:46:24.885
I missed you, too.

01:46:50.303 --> 01:46:51.748
Thank you for everything.

01:46:51.872 --> 01:46:53.792
My pleasure. She's a beautiful girl.
Thanks, man.

01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:55.717
Thank you for everything.

01:46:57.177 --> 01:46:59.282
All right, have a good one.
Bye, sweetie.

01:46:59.846 --> 01:47:01.120
Bye, sweetie.

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:15.301
Whatcha think, sweetheart?

01:47:15.362 --> 01:47:16.773
You ready to go home?

01:47:16.897 --> 01:47:18.035
Yeah.

01:47:21.768 --> 01:47:24.146
Wait, wait, wait, don't go yet!

01:47:25.238 --> 01:47:28.151
Just one more little
thing before you go.

01:47:28.208 --> 01:47:30.449
We just want to let you know
that Gracie and my family

01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:32.581
have been praying
for you every day.

01:47:32.646 --> 01:47:36.059
And she's also told me and
Wesley stories about you.

01:47:36.716 --> 01:47:38.127
Oh, boy.

01:47:38.919 --> 01:47:40.694
So, she asked if
we would pitch in

01:47:40.821 --> 01:47:42.596
and help deliver
a message to you.

01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:45.167
Okay.

01:47:45.225 --> 01:47:46.568
What message?

01:47:46.626 --> 01:47:48.162
Now, boys!

01:47:55.368 --> 01:47:58.178
You deserve all
the medals in the world.

01:47:58.605 --> 01:48:01.017
I'm really proud of you, Daddy.

01:48:01.074 --> 01:48:02.246
Thank you.

01:48:03.143 --> 01:48:05.714
You guys are gonna help me clean
this up, right?

01:48:06.413 --> 01:48:07.414
Yes!
Yes!

01:48:12.185 --> 01:48:14.825
Any calls?
Yes. Summers called.

01:48:14.888 --> 01:48:18.563
The, uh, group from Argentina
will be here a week from Tuesday.

01:48:18.625 --> 01:48:21.629
Mmm-hmm. And the new portfolio
manager called twice to remind you

01:48:21.695 --> 01:48:23.902
that he'll be in on Monday.
Okay.

01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:27.170
And Gracie Weathers
called seven times

01:48:27.267 --> 01:48:29.406
to remind you you'd
better not be late.

01:48:38.278 --> 01:48:39.586
June Bug!

01:48:41.648 --> 01:48:43.992
Ready for our good luck ritual?

01:48:46.219 --> 01:48:49.223
I wouldn't call it luck,
but let's go for it.

01:48:57.330 --> 01:49:00.072
Let them run fast,
let them run true.

01:49:00.767 --> 01:49:03.213
Let my girl stay safe and sound.

01:49:03.837 --> 01:49:06.374
Let me be a light
to those who watch.

01:49:06.439 --> 01:49:09.443
Oh, and if I could win, that would
be fine by me.

01:49:09.976 --> 01:49:12.479
Thanks, God,
for this opportunity.

01:49:12.546 --> 01:49:13.718
Amen!

01:49:21.421 --> 01:49:22.491
Okay.

01:49:34.167 --> 01:49:35.237
Okay.

01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:38.140
Okay.
All right.

01:49:38.204 --> 01:49:39.649
Hey, Dad?
Yeah?

01:49:39.706 --> 01:49:41.947
Are they here?
Yeah.

01:49:42.008 --> 01:49:43.851
Everyone's here for you. Okay.

01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:46.447
Just remember...
I know, Dad.

01:49:46.513 --> 01:49:48.083
I'm already a champion.

01:49:48.715 --> 01:49:50.194
That's right!

01:50:07.634 --> 01:50:10.547
<i>It's funny the things
that stick with you.</i>

01:50:10.604 --> 01:50:14.643
<i>Ever since I was a kid, I've been
fascinated with top 10 lists.</i>

01:50:15.108 --> 01:50:19.056
<i>The top 10 countries to visit,
top 10 roller coasters,</i>

01:50:19.913 --> 01:50:23.520
<i>but there's one list
that changed my life forever.</i>

01:50:24.317 --> 01:50:26.923
<i>Only God knew what
it would teach me.</i>

01:50:27.887 --> 01:50:30.663
<i>The importance of
sacrificing for others,</i>

01:50:32.626 --> 01:50:35.800
<i>that real peace is
found through surrender,</i>

01:50:37.597 --> 01:50:40.806
<i>and that nothing can change a
life more than forgiveness.</i>
