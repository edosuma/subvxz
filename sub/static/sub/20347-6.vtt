01:04.041 --> 01:05.792
We all yearn for a place

01:05.793 --> 01:07.708
to call home...

01:09.250 --> 01:13.125
our very own castle,
intimate and safe.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.625
Today's homes are
more wired than ever,

01:18.626 --> 01:21.208
connecting us

01:21.209 --> 01:22.291
and protecting us,

01:23.875 --> 01:26.583
but are all these devices

01:26.584 --> 01:28.041
securing our homes,

01:28.042 --> 01:30.583
or making them
more vulnerable,

01:30.584 --> 01:33.625
creating peepholes
we never imagined?

01:36.625 --> 01:40.208
Will we ever be able
to draw the curtains again?

01:50.500 --> 01:53.583
Home, to me, is

01:53.584 --> 01:56.083
the place where you feel safe.

01:58.250 --> 02:01.625
You don't have to
talk a certain way,

02:01.626 --> 02:02.375
dress a certain way,

02:02.376 --> 02:05.792
be a certain type of person.

02:05.793 --> 02:09.959
It's the place where you can
be 100% yourself.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.458
Eight years ago,

02:11.459 --> 02:14.542
Tiffany Johnson bought a home
in Cooper-Young,

02:14.543 --> 02:18.583
a middle-class neighborhood
in the heart of Memphis.

02:20.291 --> 02:21.959
I don't have much,

02:21.960 --> 02:23.834
but this is mine,

02:23.835 --> 02:26.458
and I'm gonna fight for it.

02:26.459 --> 02:28.417
I would dare someone
to try and take it from me.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.375
My dad grew up
in the house here.

02:39.333 --> 02:42.458
And I actually grew up
in this house across the street.

02:42.459 --> 02:44.291
This is Aaron James,

02:44.292 --> 02:47.166
an architect
whose family's roots

02:47.167 --> 02:51.417
in Cooper-Young
go back more than a century.

02:51.418 --> 02:54.708
This historically hip enclave
has become

02:54.709 --> 02:58.250
a desirable place
to live in Memphis,

02:58.251 --> 03:00.000
but as property values
have risen here,

03:00.001 --> 03:02.583
so has property crime.

03:02.584 --> 03:05.834
Right over there,
right across the tracks,

03:05.835 --> 03:07.917
is a whole different universe.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.333
You jump
across the railroad tracks,

03:12.334 --> 03:13.417
and you go from being
in, you know,

03:13.418 --> 03:15.834
nice kind of
middle-class neighborhood

03:15.835 --> 03:18.375
to the hood.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.417
We're just
one little part of the world,

03:22.418 --> 03:25.500
and we're trying to make it
a little safer.

03:25.501 --> 03:29.583
The way that I say it,
semi-tongue-in-cheek,

03:29.584 --> 03:32.041
is I don't want to be
70 years old,

03:32.042 --> 03:35.375
chasing some crackhead
down the sidewalk,

03:35.376 --> 03:39.041
but I simply don't want
to be anywhere else.

03:39.042 --> 03:42.583
This is where I've decided
to make a stand.

03:46.333 --> 03:47.708
Tiffany met Aaron

03:47.709 --> 03:50.583
where she's met
many of her neighbors...

03:50.584 --> 03:55.041
Online on Nextdoor.

03:55.042 --> 03:59.417
It's basically like
Facebook for your neighborhood.

03:59.418 --> 04:02.750
People can post things
that range from,

04:02.751 --> 04:05.250
"I'm putting a mattress
out on my curb,"

04:05.251 --> 04:08.959
to, "There's a creepy dude
looking in people's windows.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.625
Everybody keep an eye out."

04:10.626 --> 04:14.000
Aaron posted
about possibly restarting

04:14.001 --> 04:15.750
the neighborhood watch,

04:15.751 --> 04:17.875
and I immediately responded
to him and said,

04:17.875 --> 04:19.959
"Hey, I'm all in.
What can I do to help?"

04:30.375 --> 04:33.792
Home invasions are evolving.

04:33.793 --> 04:35.000
Criminals break in,

04:35.001 --> 04:37.041
not just
through windows and doors

04:37.042 --> 04:39.333
but through cables and code.

04:41.417 --> 04:43.875
I lived in that house
for 4 1/2 years,

04:43.876 --> 04:46.083
so I felt very safe.

04:48.250 --> 04:49.708
I was looking at my Facebook,

04:49.709 --> 04:54.083
and I had a message from a name
that I didn't recognize.

04:55.667 --> 04:58.417
The entire profile
was all different photos

04:58.418 --> 05:01.458
of Heath Ledger as the Joker.

05:01.459 --> 05:04.500
I opened up the message
and saw these photos

05:04.501 --> 05:09.417
of me and my boyfriend
sleeping in bed

05:09.418 --> 05:10.625
and was just like,

05:10.626 --> 05:12.208
"My god. Who saw me sl...

05:12.209 --> 05:15.375
Like, what else did they see?"

05:15.376 --> 05:16.875
A three-word message

05:16.876 --> 05:17.625
accompanied the photographs.

05:26.375 --> 05:28.834
I had no idea how someone

05:28.835 --> 05:31.625
could have gotten those photos.

05:33.417 --> 05:36.375
How did that happen?

05:38.750 --> 05:41.458
The photos of
Chelsea Clark and her boyfriend

05:41.459 --> 05:43.417
were taken two nights earlier,

05:43.418 --> 05:46.250
while they were
watching a movie.

05:46.251 --> 05:48.166
My boyfriend and I
had gone to bed,

05:48.167 --> 05:51.750
getting tired,
ready to fall asleep,

05:51.751 --> 05:55.333
watching TV on my computer,
like everyone else.

05:55.334 --> 05:56.792
Everyone has a laptop
in their home,

05:56.793 --> 05:58.166
and you don't think of it
because it's such

05:58.167 --> 06:00.625
a commonplace item.

06:00.626 --> 06:04.000
But there's still
that potential of it

06:04.001 --> 06:05.500
becoming a window
for someone else.

06:13.542 --> 06:16.291
There was a third person
with us in the bedroom

06:16.292 --> 06:19.041
that we had not invited,

06:19.042 --> 06:20.375
and they were watching

06:20.376 --> 06:21.333
and paying attention
to what we were doing,

06:21.334 --> 06:23.875
totally unbeknownst to us.

06:25.708 --> 06:26.917
Who would do this?

06:41.834 --> 06:46.041
I think there's
an urge within people

06:46.042 --> 06:47.792
to peer on others,

06:47.793 --> 06:50.375
to know what others are doing,

06:50.376 --> 06:54.041
and technology sort of dangles

06:54.042 --> 06:55.542
that forbidden fruit
in front of us.

06:59.291 --> 07:02.291
It opens up these new doors,
these new windows.

07:04.667 --> 07:08.250
For Michael,
the new window was voyeur porn.

07:08.251 --> 07:09.417
For the most part,

07:09.418 --> 07:13.208
I only ever looked
at normal porn,

07:13.209 --> 07:14.959
but sometimes,

07:14.960 --> 07:17.542
you see different categories
that you click on.

07:17.543 --> 07:21.166
And then you look
at other stuff.

07:21.167 --> 07:24.583
The "other stuff"
had been captured allegedly

07:24.584 --> 07:26.583
by cameras that were
hacked or hidden

07:26.584 --> 07:31.792
in bedrooms,
closets, bathrooms,

07:31.793 --> 07:33.834
then posted on web forums

07:33.835 --> 07:35.750
that trade
in invasions of privacy.

07:39.375 --> 07:42.083
On August 2, 2013,

07:42.084 --> 07:45.291
Michael took his curiosity
one step further.

07:45.292 --> 07:47.792
He hosted a party at his home

07:47.793 --> 07:49.625
and hid his smartphone
in the bathroom,

07:49.626 --> 07:54.375
setting it to record
his female guests.

07:54.376 --> 07:55.875
I knew that it was an invasion

07:55.876 --> 07:57.667
of somebody's privacy

07:57.668 --> 08:00.959
in a setting where they have
every right in the world

08:00.960 --> 08:02.875
to have that privacy.

08:04.625 --> 08:08.500
I'm not sure
why I pushed myself to do that.

08:11.041 --> 08:14.291
A camera
connected to the Internet...

08:14.292 --> 08:16.083
A tool of perversion

08:16.084 --> 08:18.750
in the hands of one user,

08:18.751 --> 08:20.291
a tool of protection

08:20.292 --> 08:22.542
for a city besieged by crime.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.708
The FBI's labeled Memphis

08:24.709 --> 08:27.500
the third most dangerous city
in the country.

08:27.501 --> 08:29.333
It was
another weekend of violence.

08:29.334 --> 08:30.834
Right now,
Memphis is averaging

08:30.835 --> 08:31.917
around four murders a week.

08:31.918 --> 08:34.166
The city's homicide rate shows

08:34.167 --> 08:35.291
no sign of slowing down,

08:35.292 --> 08:39.500
and many of the killers
still roam the streets.

08:39.501 --> 08:41.667
It's just insanity.
It's absolute insanity.

08:41.668 --> 08:46.250
People getting shot
right on the street.

08:46.251 --> 08:47.834
Outgunned and outmanned,

08:47.835 --> 08:50.166
the Memphis Police Department
has deployed

08:50.167 --> 08:52.542
a sophisticated network
of cameras,

08:52.543 --> 08:54.417
called SkyCop.

08:56.208 --> 08:58.250
It can analyze gunshots,

08:58.251 --> 09:00.250
track suspicious objects,

09:00.251 --> 09:01.834
and every license plate
captured can be

09:01.835 --> 09:05.708
instantly cross-referenced
for outstanding warrants,

09:05.709 --> 09:07.875
criminal records,
and unpaid tickets.

09:07.876 --> 09:10.166
You are trespassing

09:10.167 --> 09:11.500
on private property.

09:11.501 --> 09:14.542
You must leave immediately,
or the police will be called.

09:14.543 --> 09:18.542
You have 5 seconds
to comply.

09:18.543 --> 09:20.708
SkyCop has been
credited with reducing crime

09:20.709 --> 09:25.166
by as much as 90%
in some areas,

09:25.167 --> 09:27.000
and that success has created

09:27.001 --> 09:30.458
high demand across Memphis.

09:30.459 --> 09:33.375
There's just one problem...

09:33.376 --> 09:38.125
A single SkyCop camera
costs nearly $10,000.

09:38.126 --> 09:39.875
There's very
few neighborhoods

09:39.876 --> 09:42.667
that can afford
that sort of technology,

09:42.668 --> 09:44.959
especially on any scale
that would be of value.

09:44.960 --> 09:49.583
Aaron is
proposing a bold solution...

09:49.584 --> 09:53.583
To construct a do-it-yourself
surveillance network,

09:53.584 --> 09:55.583
controlled not by the police

09:55.584 --> 09:58.041
but by Aaron and his neighbors.

10:00.208 --> 10:03.583
For the cost of
one single SkyCop,

10:03.584 --> 10:06.583
we are essentially covering
the entire neighborhood

10:06.584 --> 10:08.750
with off-the-shelf technology.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.625
Roughly 85%
of our criminal activity

10:13.626 --> 10:17.375
is perpetrated by people
outside of the neighborhood,

10:17.376 --> 10:19.417
so the strategy then becomes,

10:19.418 --> 10:22.417
we create a virtual tripwire

10:22.418 --> 10:24.500
around the perimeter.

10:24.501 --> 10:26.125
Cameras will stand guard

10:26.126 --> 10:27.208
on porches and eves,

10:27.209 --> 10:30.583
trained on stop signs
and traffic lights,

10:30.584 --> 10:32.458
all of the entry
and exit points

10:32.459 --> 10:35.291
in the neighborhood.

10:35.292 --> 10:36.458
As a pedestrian
or a vehicle

10:36.459 --> 10:39.291
approaches a stop sign,

10:39.292 --> 10:41.333
the camera automatically
records

10:41.334 --> 10:44.125
a 30-to-45-second video.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.750
If a neighbor's
been victimized,

10:47.751 --> 10:51.417
the footage will be able
to identify folks

10:51.418 --> 10:54.834
who don't fit in.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.750
Feels like Christmas.

11:01.917 --> 11:03.291
Got it.

11:03.292 --> 11:04.959
All right.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.917
Right on.

11:06.918 --> 11:09.458
Once we catch two
or three of these criminals,

11:09.459 --> 11:11.708
the word is going to get out.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.000
In Cooper-Young,

11:25.001 --> 11:27.500
not everyone shares
Aaron and Tiffany's enthusiasm

11:27.501 --> 11:29.625
about the camera network.

11:29.626 --> 11:32.458
That includes Nick Cantarochi,

11:32.459 --> 11:34.750
a Vietnam veteran

11:34.751 --> 11:38.625
hoping to turn the tide
against the program.

11:38.626 --> 11:41.667
I'm a patriot.

11:41.668 --> 11:44.750
I want only the best
for my community, you know.

11:44.751 --> 11:45.875
I don't want to live
under a police state.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.708
How these cameras
are going to be used,

11:50.709 --> 11:52.166
when they're going to be used,

11:52.167 --> 11:54.542
and who has access
to these feeds,

11:54.543 --> 11:57.250
and how long are they going
to keep the feeds for?

11:59.291 --> 12:00.750
I think we're approaching

12:00.751 --> 12:03.083
George Orwell's
worst nightmare,

12:03.084 --> 12:04.834
and we're becoming
more digitized every day.

12:06.750 --> 12:10.542
Some people have
lost sight of what...

12:10.543 --> 12:12.375
They don't understand
what freedom is.

12:12.376 --> 12:14.417
I mean, Christ almighty!

12:14.418 --> 12:15.667
I don't think some of them
can even spell freedom anymore

12:15.668 --> 12:20.041
'cause they're too busy texting.

12:20.042 --> 12:22.667
Just because
technology is misused

12:22.668 --> 12:24.875
by some people
in some instances

12:24.876 --> 12:27.750
doesn't mean that
I should shun it

12:27.751 --> 12:31.834
in some symbolic
act of indignation

12:31.835 --> 12:33.750
when, in fact,
that same technology

12:33.751 --> 12:36.792
could be an advantage to me.

12:36.793 --> 12:39.500
For Tiffany,
this isn't an abstract debate.

12:39.501 --> 12:41.583
It's personal.

12:44.250 --> 12:46.959
Security was
not always high

12:46.960 --> 12:49.125
on my priority list.

12:49.126 --> 12:51.417
But when I was in law school,

12:51.418 --> 12:55.458
my best friend was murdered
in a home invasion.

13:00.708 --> 13:03.708
I consider James
to be a brother.

13:05.834 --> 13:07.708
We went to junior high
and high school together,

13:07.709 --> 13:11.500
and we were very, very close.

13:11.501 --> 13:12.708
At that moment in my life,

13:12.709 --> 13:18.041
I was in a rebellious phase
in terms of technology,

13:18.042 --> 13:20.125
and so when James was shot,

13:20.126 --> 13:24.333
my brother was desperately
trying to reach me.

13:24.334 --> 13:26.792
I had a pager at the time,
but I hated the thing,

13:26.793 --> 13:28.125
and it was turned off.

13:28.126 --> 13:30.583
So once I found out,

13:30.584 --> 13:33.041
I realized that
he had been alive

13:33.042 --> 13:34.959
through...

13:34.960 --> 13:38.959
much of those hours
when I was, um...

13:41.125 --> 13:42.959
when I had my pager turned off.

13:42.960 --> 13:47.959
I had disconnected,
and that was a time

13:47.960 --> 13:51.458
when a connection would have
really been invaluable to me.

13:53.125 --> 13:56.500
That was when
personal security

13:56.501 --> 13:59.834
became real for me,
became palpable.

14:02.333 --> 14:04.792
You really only got
two choices in life.

14:04.793 --> 14:08.000
You can either sit idly
as life happens to you,

14:08.001 --> 14:11.834
or you can take
a more proactive approach

14:11.835 --> 14:15.000
and make decisions
that shape your own life,

14:15.001 --> 14:18.583
which is all
the camera program is.

14:23.458 --> 14:24.667
Tonight,
Tiffany's neighbors

14:24.668 --> 14:27.834
will have the opportunity
to make their own decision

14:27.835 --> 14:29.458
at a community meeting

14:29.459 --> 14:32.792
to address concerns
about the camera program.

14:32.793 --> 14:34.000
I know a lot of times,

14:34.001 --> 14:37.625
when people just hear
the word camera,

14:37.626 --> 14:39.708
they automatically
think the worst.

14:39.709 --> 14:41.917
They automatically
think Big Brother

14:41.918 --> 14:44.250
where it's a whole wall
full of monitors.

14:44.251 --> 14:47.667
That has absolutely
nothing to do

14:47.668 --> 14:50.542
with our camera program,
okay?

14:50.543 --> 14:54.041
My house was burglarized twice
and my car once.

14:54.042 --> 14:57.542
There are clearly people
monitoring our behavior...

14:57.543 --> 14:58.750
Absolutely.
in the interest

14:58.751 --> 15:00.166
of robbing us,

15:00.167 --> 15:04.542
and if we don't monitor theirs,
we're idiots.

15:04.543 --> 15:06.667
Right on. Thank you so much.

15:06.668 --> 15:09.583
If, for any reason,

15:09.584 --> 15:13.041
we just so happen to see
something unrelated,

15:13.042 --> 15:16.500
somebody not picking up
their dog poop,

15:16.501 --> 15:18.166
we could care less.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.166
What happens to this material?

15:20.167 --> 15:23.083
Does it get bulked?
Does it go into a central...

15:24.792 --> 15:27.417
It gets written over.

15:27.418 --> 15:28.250
You know this
for a fact?

15:31.083 --> 15:32.208
Okay.

15:32.209 --> 15:34.917
It's important that this stuff
does not end up

15:34.918 --> 15:38.083
being compiled
into a central point.

15:38.084 --> 15:39.375
Never. Never.

15:39.376 --> 15:43.041
No one is ever going to be
monitoring the cameras.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.417
I like Aaron. He's a good guy.

15:48.418 --> 15:52.250
I think he has the community's
interest at heart,

15:52.251 --> 15:56.375
but there's a possibility that,
down the line,

15:56.376 --> 15:57.875
these cameras could be used

15:57.876 --> 16:01.458
so something else
than stopping crime.

16:01.459 --> 16:05.250
The road to hell is paved
with good intentions, right?

16:08.625 --> 16:11.125
In Toronto,
Chelsea was confronting

16:11.126 --> 16:14.625
a very different
kind of camera program.

16:14.626 --> 16:18.750
Something or someone
had infected her computer

16:18.751 --> 16:22.125
and turned it into a peephole.

16:22.126 --> 16:23.875
I was put in touch
with a few people

16:23.876 --> 16:25.291
who work as hackers

16:25.292 --> 16:27.625
or who have insight
into this community,

16:27.626 --> 16:30.166
and I sent a few
of them the photos

16:30.167 --> 16:32.959
to see if they were
able to trace it.

16:32.960 --> 16:36.583
I wanted some peace of mind
or some understanding.

16:36.584 --> 16:40.125
I didn't see any other recourse.

16:40.126 --> 16:41.792
According to her contacts,

16:41.793 --> 16:45.500
Chelsea's laptop
was infected by a RAT...

16:45.501 --> 16:47.959
A remote access Trojan,

16:47.960 --> 16:51.834
malicious code that hijacks
computers and smartphones

16:51.835 --> 16:54.500
and takes control.

16:54.501 --> 16:57.583
Hackers who deploy RATs
are called "RATters,"

16:57.584 --> 17:00.125
and their targets
are called "slaves."

17:02.500 --> 17:05.000
Any camera that's
connected to the Internet

17:05.001 --> 17:07.333
is vulnerable...

17:07.334 --> 17:11.000
and there are cameras
watching us everywhere...

17:11.001 --> 17:13.250
At coffee shops...

17:13.251 --> 17:15.040
on the streets...

17:15.041 --> 17:15.916
in our homes...

17:15.917 --> 17:19.625
more cameras, more windows,

17:19.626 --> 17:21.916
more peeping Toms.

17:21.917 --> 17:24.333
And some of them
do more than peep.

17:30.333 --> 17:34.250
Sausarge is the alias
for a camera troll.

17:34.251 --> 17:38.041
He doesn't just peer
into people's lives.

17:38.042 --> 17:41.542
He enters their conversations.

17:41.543 --> 17:42.959
But it's not hacking...

17:42.960 --> 17:43.333
as he sees it.

17:57.333 --> 17:59.041
People think that I'm some sort

17:59.042 --> 18:00.750
of glamour hacker

18:00.751 --> 18:05.041
when all I'm doing is
clicking a link.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.208
I just scroll down the list
and wait

18:07.209 --> 18:09.750
until I see a camera
in an office or a living room.

18:09.751 --> 18:11.083
You just click it,

18:11.084 --> 18:14.583
and you're connected
to their camera.

18:14.584 --> 18:18.959
Sausarge locates
his targets through Shodan,

18:18.960 --> 18:20.708
a website some call

18:20.709 --> 18:24.208
the scariest search engine
on the Internet.

18:24.209 --> 18:27.250
It was intended as a tool
for admins and developers

18:27.251 --> 18:30.583
to scan the growing
Internet of Things.

18:30.584 --> 18:34.041
Instead, it's exposed
a vast Internet of threats...

18:34.042 --> 18:37.375
Millions of unsecured devices,

18:37.376 --> 18:41.083
from lightbulbs
to power plants.

18:41.084 --> 18:43.250
IP cameras are the tip
of an iceberg.

18:56.625 --> 18:58.041
I've got to admit,

18:58.042 --> 19:01.417
the primary reason is
for a bit of a giggle.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.625
Hello.

19:05.625 --> 19:09.000
Ghost!

19:09.001 --> 19:12.625
It's basically like
a prank phone call.

19:12.626 --> 19:16.458
I do have some sort
of morals and standards.

19:16.459 --> 19:18.125
If I'm given the chance,

19:18.126 --> 19:20.625
I will tell them
how to password their camera.

19:34.417 --> 19:36.834
Nope.

19:36.835 --> 19:38.625
-Bye.
-Later.

19:41.417 --> 19:43.041
I have seen some weird cameras

19:43.042 --> 19:45.000
in people's bathrooms.

19:45.001 --> 19:48.458
I have no idea
what they're trying to secure.

19:48.459 --> 19:51.500
I get the impression
someone set up those cameras

19:51.501 --> 19:54.083
to spy on people themselves,

19:54.084 --> 19:56.458
which is pretty creepy.

20:03.583 --> 20:07.792
At some point,
somebody did use the restroom,

20:07.793 --> 20:10.208
and they could see

20:10.209 --> 20:13.500
the iris of the camera
on the phone,

20:13.501 --> 20:15.333
so they knew
that it was in there.

20:19.375 --> 20:21.375
Michael got busted,

20:21.376 --> 20:23.959
and on July 3, 2014,

20:23.960 --> 20:27.417
he was convicted of one count
of invasion of privacy.

20:29.458 --> 20:31.083
Because of new state laws,

20:31.084 --> 20:32.917
his offense was labeled
a sex crime

20:32.918 --> 20:36.708
and Michael an SVP.

20:44.333 --> 20:47.041
I am now lumped in
with the worst of the worst

20:47.042 --> 20:49.875
types of sex offender...

20:49.876 --> 20:52.834
The child molesters,
the rapists.

20:52.835 --> 20:55.166
I'm looked at in the same way.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.417
You have to give
the state police

20:59.418 --> 21:01.041
your e-mail address,

21:01.042 --> 21:02.875
whatever passwords they want,

21:02.876 --> 21:04.208
any social media,

21:04.209 --> 21:06.417
the vehicle you drive,
license plate number,

21:06.418 --> 21:07.750
who owns it.

21:07.751 --> 21:09.166
Every single aspect
about your life

21:09.167 --> 21:11.917
is given to the state police,

21:11.918 --> 21:14.959
and they will use that
to keep an eye on you.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.542
And there are
GPS-enabled smartphone apps

21:19.543 --> 21:22.667
that allow everyone
to keep an eye on offenders,

21:22.668 --> 21:24.750
like Michael.

21:24.751 --> 21:27.959
Wherever he goes,
his records follow.

21:34.625 --> 21:38.500
I was charged
with invasion of privacy.

21:38.501 --> 21:41.125
The irony now is,

21:41.126 --> 21:42.667
for the rest of my life,

21:42.668 --> 21:44.917
I don't have any privacy.

21:48.458 --> 21:51.250
The guilt of what I did
will live with me

21:51.251 --> 21:52.834
for the rest of my life.

21:52.835 --> 21:54.458
It was wrong.

21:54.459 --> 21:56.000
It was horribly wrong.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Now I'm sort of living
in this window

22:02.001 --> 22:06.792
where everybody can view me
at any point in time.

22:06.793 --> 22:09.458
I constantly feel
like I'm on public display

22:09.459 --> 22:12.208
in the world's
worst freak show.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.625
I live in digital hell.

22:27.667 --> 22:29.667
Okay,
We have a camera mounted.

22:29.668 --> 22:33.458
With the support
of most of his neighbors

22:33.459 --> 22:35.917
and a $15,000 grant

22:35.918 --> 22:37.542
from the city of Memphis,

22:37.543 --> 22:39.625
Aaron's controversial
camera program

22:39.626 --> 22:43.291
is finally coming to life
in Cooper-Young.

22:43.292 --> 22:47.291
Tiffany's home will host
the first of 72 cameras

22:47.292 --> 22:48.667
that will form
the neighborhood's

22:48.668 --> 22:51.375
digital perimeter.

22:51.376 --> 22:52.333
To ensure that
community members

22:52.334 --> 22:55.375
don't abuse this technology,

22:55.376 --> 22:57.458
they've created
a series of bylaws

22:57.459 --> 23:00.041
to keep the program honest.

23:00.042 --> 23:01.792
Rule number one...

23:01.793 --> 23:05.041
The cameras
are never monitored.

23:05.042 --> 23:05.917
If nothing happens,

23:05.918 --> 23:08.792
no one ever sees
what's on these cameras,

23:08.793 --> 23:10.375
and the footage is
constantly rewritten.

23:10.376 --> 23:12.750
Rule number two...

23:12.751 --> 23:13.875
The footage is only pulled

23:13.876 --> 23:19.458
when a neighbor reports
a crime to the police.

23:19.459 --> 23:21.208
A neighbor can't say,

23:21.209 --> 23:23.250
"Hey, I think my husband
was cheating on me.

23:23.251 --> 23:25.875
Can you check the cameras
from 3:00 yesterday morning

23:25.876 --> 23:27.000
and see if somebody
pulled in my driveway?"

23:27.001 --> 23:29.041
No.

23:30.458 --> 23:31.625
Rule number three...

23:31.626 --> 23:34.375
If the cameras capture
a suspect,

23:34.376 --> 23:37.875
the footage is immediately
handed over to the authorities.

23:37.876 --> 23:42.959
We will never
upload videos of any individual

23:42.960 --> 23:47.417
who simply appears to be
acting suspiciously.

23:47.418 --> 23:51.250
We have to stay as far away

23:51.251 --> 23:54.875
from the concept
of vigilantism as possible.

23:54.876 --> 23:58.875
Aaron also claims
to have hack-proofed the system

23:58.876 --> 24:02.458
against invaders
like RATters and camera trolls.

24:02.459 --> 24:05.250
Each camera has its own router

24:05.251 --> 24:09.959
that can only be accessed
from within 75 feet.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.583
The way that
we currently have

24:11.584 --> 24:13.500
this camera program set up,

24:13.501 --> 24:17.458
I don't see any reason
for concern.

24:19.667 --> 24:22.750
Chelsea Clark has
reason for concern.

24:22.751 --> 24:25.458
Her hacker friends
never located her RATter.

24:25.459 --> 24:27.542
There's no way of knowing

24:27.543 --> 24:29.458
if he lived 10,000 miles away

24:29.459 --> 24:33.708
or just 10 houses
up the street.

24:33.709 --> 24:37.333
I find it a very
unnerving thought that

24:37.334 --> 24:41.542
you're not necessarily alone
in your home,

24:41.543 --> 24:44.291
but we're not going
to regress to the point

24:44.292 --> 24:46.834
where no one's using
this technology anymore.

24:46.835 --> 24:49.000
You just kind of have
to live with the idea

24:49.001 --> 24:52.917
that this is just
the darker side of it.

24:52.918 --> 24:55.875
The entirety
of my security now

24:55.876 --> 24:56.625
is a Band-Aid

24:56.626 --> 24:58.792
over the camera on my computer.

24:58.793 --> 25:00.959
I don't know what to do
about the microphone,

25:00.960 --> 25:04.750
but we literally got a Band-Aid
fix over the whole thing.

25:10.667 --> 25:13.750
Almost a year after
the cameras were installed,

25:13.751 --> 25:17.166
it's a brave new world
in Cooper-Young.

25:17.167 --> 25:18.458
According to Aaron James,

25:18.459 --> 25:21.834
home burglaries are way down.

25:21.835 --> 25:23.750
Now other Memphis neighborhoods

25:23.751 --> 25:25.750
are looking to Cooper-Young

25:25.751 --> 25:28.959
and Aaron for tech support.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.667
If we only do it
in Cooper-Young,

25:30.668 --> 25:33.959
we haven't accomplished
a single thing.

25:33.960 --> 25:38.000
We have to share that
with the entire city.

25:38.001 --> 25:41.625
We have to let
the criminals know

25:41.626 --> 25:45.166
that they are being watched.

25:45.167 --> 25:46.500
At the end of the day,

25:46.501 --> 25:48.834
humanity needs technology,

25:48.835 --> 25:51.542
and as long as we are careful

25:51.543 --> 25:54.375
in how we manage
that relationship,

25:54.376 --> 25:58.291
I think it's beneficial.

25:58.292 --> 26:00.917
What would be going too far,
in my opinion,

26:00.918 --> 26:03.333
is if we started doing
precisely the things

26:03.334 --> 26:04.792
that we vowed not to do.

26:08.125 --> 26:09.208
What we've discovered

26:09.209 --> 26:13.250
in the course
of reviewing footage is that,

26:13.251 --> 26:14.667
every single night of the week,

26:14.668 --> 26:18.375
we have what we're referring to
as lurkers,

26:18.376 --> 26:21.041
and that's people
who are just out and about.

26:21.042 --> 26:26.875
This particular suspect
fits that criteria to a "T."

26:26.876 --> 26:29.166
Here it is.
It's 12:30 at night.

26:29.167 --> 26:31.750
He's just sort of
lurking along.

26:31.751 --> 26:35.458
He's obviously not just walking
from point A to point B.

26:35.459 --> 26:38.542
I don't recognize the guy.

26:38.543 --> 26:42.708
We're going to post that video
on Nextdoor,

26:42.709 --> 26:47.250
asking our neighbors
to identify this person.

26:47.251 --> 26:49.000
That's the very next step

26:49.001 --> 26:51.417
in the evolution
of this program.

26:53.417 --> 26:56.166
We have to send the cockroaches

26:56.167 --> 26:57.583
back into the crevasses

26:57.584 --> 27:01.166
to where the people
who want to live

27:01.167 --> 27:03.708
in those neighborhoods
can do so in peace

27:03.709 --> 27:05.750
without fucking
getting shot at.

27:05.751 --> 27:07.959
We have to be a gang.

27:07.960 --> 27:12.625
We have to fight
just like the gangs fight.

27:16.792 --> 27:19.792
Our homes
may be more vulnerable

27:19.793 --> 27:21.959
than ever before,

27:21.960 --> 27:25.083
but is it the network
we need to fear...

27:25.084 --> 27:27.041
or each other?

27:27.042 --> 27:30.291
We're just sort of
peering over the edge

27:30.292 --> 27:33.041
between being a user

27:33.042 --> 27:35.458
and being used.

27:36.305 --> 27:42.429
