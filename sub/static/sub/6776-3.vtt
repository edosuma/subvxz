ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, LP.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.791
OKAY, LET'S GO THEN !

01:59.800 --> 02:01.552
( dog barking )

02:01.560 --> 02:02.652
ARE YOU PACKED ?

02:02.660 --> 02:06.323
DON'T FORGET
THE DOG, HONEY.

02:08.860 --> 02:10.452
MICHAEL ?

02:10.460 --> 02:14.123
DON'T FORGET
THE DOG, HONEY.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.295
HOW ARE YOU FEELING ?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.127
HE'S NOT IN THE CAR,
IS HE ?

02:24.130 --> 02:25.927
WHY IS HE TALKING
ABOUT A DOG ?

02:25.930 --> 02:27.090
WHAT DOG ?

02:27.100 --> 02:29.227
WE HAD A DOG
IN BOULDER.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.491
WHAT IS THIS ?

02:37.500 --> 02:38.956
WE'RE IN THE HOSPITAL.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.258
YOU'RE SICK,
REMEMBER ?

02:41.260 --> 02:43.455
BUT YOU'RE GONNA
BE JUST FINE.

02:43.460 --> 02:47.123
RITA, LYING TO HIM DOESN'T
HELP ANYBODY BUT YOU.

02:52.530 --> 02:53.827
STOP IT.

02:53.830 --> 02:55.320
NURSE !

02:55.330 --> 02:56.797
IT'S OKAY
TO LET GO.

02:56.800 --> 02:57.653
NURSE !

02:57.660 --> 02:59.491
I'M GONNA BEAT IT.

02:59.500 --> 03:02.549
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN'T.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.198
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.529
WHY WOULD
YOU SAY THAT ?

03:08.530 --> 03:12.091
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE SCARED.

03:14.630 --> 03:16.723
I DON'T WANT TO DIE.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.449
I'M NOT GONNA DIE.

03:21.460 --> 03:26.159
THAT'S JUST YOUR BODY,
IT'S NOT YOU.

03:27.430 --> 03:29.853
THAT'S BULLSHIT, EILEEN.

03:32.130 --> 03:34.121
EXCUSE ME.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.452
HERE YOU GO.

03:36.460 --> 03:37.950
WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE
YOUR MORPHINE,

03:37.960 --> 03:39.689
ALRIGHT, MR. PIPER ?

03:53.860 --> 03:56.499
DO YOU SEE ?

03:58.360 --> 03:59.452
RITA ?

03:59.460 --> 04:01.428
ABOVE HIS HEAD ?

04:01.430 --> 04:03.398
THE LIGHT ?

04:03.400 --> 04:06.927
HE'S A GOOD BOY,
HE'S A GOOD BOY.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.628
( whistling )

04:18.430 --> 04:20.955
(flatlining sound )

04:26.560 --> 04:28.994
( dog barking )

04:34.230 --> 04:36.824
BE'I'I'ER HURRY UP,
WE'VE GOT MRS. PIPER AT 8:30.

04:36.830 --> 04:38.422
YEAH, I'LL BE
RIGHT THERE.

04:38.430 --> 04:41.024
WHATCHA DOIN', DAVE ?

04:41.030 --> 04:43.954
DOWNLOADING SOME PICS
FROM MANSLUTS-DOT-COM ?

04:43.960 --> 04:46.190
"LIVING WITH AVM".

04:46.200 --> 04:48.589
GREAT, DAVE, THAN KS.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.556
I JUST THOUGHT WE SHOULD
HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.925
WELL, I HAVE ALL
THE INFORMATION.

04:51.930 --> 04:52.794
I DON'T THINK YOU DO.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.392
IF YOU DON'T
GET THIS TREATED,

04:54.400 --> 04:56.857
YOU COULD HAVE SEIZURES
WITH MUSCULAR TWITCHING,

04:56.860 --> 04:58.191
LOSS OF
VERBAL SKILLS...

04:58.200 --> 05:01.192
YOU COULD EVEN HAVE SOME KIND
OF HEMORRHAGE, AT SOME POINT.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.122
OR I COULD BE IN THE WRONG
AIRPLANE, AT SOME POINT.

05:03.130 --> 05:04.449
OR SO COULD YOU.

05:04.460 --> 05:06.428
ALRIGHT ?
C'MON.

05:14.630 --> 05:15.927
THE PARLIAMENT.

05:15.930 --> 05:17.625
IT'S VERY ELEGANT.

05:17.630 --> 05:18.528
YES,

05:18.530 --> 05:21.124
I LIKE IT.

05:22.300 --> 05:24.552
BUT MICHAEL
THINKS IT'S TACKY.

05:33.430 --> 05:35.091
THAT'S THE CLEVELAND.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.897
IT'S A MORE
AFFORDABLE CHOICE,

05:36.900 --> 05:38.925
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE,
IT'S NOT QUITE AS...

05:38.930 --> 05:40.397
GRACIOUS.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.924
REALLY, NO ?

05:41.930 --> 05:45.388
BUT IT'S JUST SO,
SORT OF, SELF-EFFACING...

05:46.730 --> 05:48.220
BUT WHY ?

05:48.230 --> 05:50.551
MRS. PIPER ?

05:50.560 --> 05:52.357
I'M SORRY, CAN YOU
EXCUSE ME FOR A MOMENT ?

05:52.360 --> 05:54.828
I CAN'T CARRY ON
TWO CONVERSATIONS AT ONCE.

05:56.330 --> 05:58.321
IT'S EXACTLY LIKE
THAT HORRIBLE IKEA COUCH

05:58.330 --> 06:00.628
YOUR MOTHER BOUGHT US !

06:05.530 --> 06:07.225
MICHAEL CLAIMS
TO LOVE THIS ONE.

06:07.230 --> 06:09.755
IN MY OPINION,
HE'S JUST TRYING TO DO

06:09.760 --> 06:11.921
WHAT HE THINKS
HIS MOTHER WANTS.

06:11.930 --> 06:13.295
WHICH IS TYPICAL,
REALLY.

06:13.300 --> 06:17.259
FINE, DENY IT,
WHY CHANGE NOW ?

06:17.260 --> 06:20.149
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SIT DOWN FOR A MINUTE ?

06:20.160 --> 06:21.491
OH, I'M FINE.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.024
IT'S JUST,
MICHAEL'S HERE.

06:23.030 --> 06:25.089
HE DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL
WITH ANY OF THIS STUFF

06:25.100 --> 06:26.590
WHEN HE WAS ALIVE.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.625
YOU KNOW,
THE FUNERAL.

06:28.630 --> 06:30.393
NOW HE'S VERY
OPINIONATED.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.049
HUH.

06:32.060 --> 06:35.223
I'M A PSYCHIC,
SO, YOU KNOW...

06:35.230 --> 06:36.697
WOW.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.055
THAT MUST BE VERY
INTERESTING FOR YOU.

06:39.060 --> 06:42.154
IT'S JUST
MORE INFORMATION.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.828
THIS ROOM HAS A LOT
OF PAIN IN IT.

06:50.830 --> 06:52.627
WELL...

06:52.630 --> 06:55.121
YES.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.827
YOU HAVE A LOT
IN YOUR MIND.

06:58.830 --> 07:00.297
ON YOUR MIND, I MEAN.

07:00.300 --> 07:02.689
DON'T YOU ?

07:02.700 --> 07:05.089
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.556
DON'T WORRY.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.620
IT'S OKAY,
ALRIGHT ?

07:09.630 --> 07:12.451
IT'S ALL
GONNA BE OKAY.

07:12.460 --> 07:14.928
UH, THANKS.

07:16.430 --> 07:18.421
WELL, OKAY, HONEY.

07:18.430 --> 07:19.795
IF IT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.893
IT'S YOUR FUNERAL.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.591
LOOK, SHE GAVE ME
HER CARD.

07:36.600 --> 07:40.252
"SPIRITUAL CONSULTATION
AND PAST LIFE REGRESSION".

07:40.260 --> 07:41.989
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE,
WHO DOES THIS ?

07:42.000 --> 07:45.322
WHO SPENDS $100 TO BE TOLD THEY
WERE ONCE ELEANOR OF AQUITAINE ?

07:45.330 --> 07:49.528
OR WHOEVER,
THE MARQUIS DE SADE.

07:49.530 --> 07:52.556
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
HAPPENS AFTER WE DIE ?

07:52.560 --> 07:54.653
HEAVEN ?
OR HELL.

07:54.660 --> 07:56.196
REALLY ?
WELL, YEAH.

07:56.200 --> 07:59.021
YEAH, BUT WITH LIKE
ANGELS AND DEVILS

07:59.030 --> 08:00.793
OR BRIMSTONE,
OR WHATEVER ?

08:00.800 --> 08:02.199
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE,
OR WHO ELSE IS THERE,

08:02.200 --> 08:03.690
BUT YES, I DO BELIEVE
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES

08:03.700 --> 08:05.292
FOR THE WAY
WE LIVE OUR LIVES.

08:05.300 --> 08:06.790
HUH.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.494
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
I KIND OF FEEL LIKE...

08:12.500 --> 08:15.060
DAD'S AROUND.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.591
DO YOU, EVER ?

08:21.230 --> 08:22.754
NOPE.

08:25.830 --> 08:27.388
YOU KNOW,
WE HAVE

08:27.400 --> 08:29.254
THE INDEPENDENT
FUNERAL DIRECTORS
LUNCH TODAY, RIGHT ?

08:29.260 --> 08:31.091
MAN, WHY DO
I HAVE TO GO ?

08:31.100 --> 08:32.499
THAT'S YOUR THING.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.127
IT'S YOUR THING TOO NOW,
THESE ARE YOUR COLLEAGUES.

08:34.130 --> 08:35.358
IT'S IMPORTANT
TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.452
I KNOW WHO THEY ARE.

08:36.460 --> 08:37.552
I MET THEM IN VEGAS,
THEY'RE FREAKS.

08:37.560 --> 08:40.256
THEY'RE NOT FREAKS.

08:40.260 --> 08:42.251
NOBODY LIKES
THE BRAZIL NUTS, DAVID.

08:42.260 --> 08:44.728
NOT THE LOCAL GUYS.

08:44.730 --> 08:46.527
OH YEAH, I'M SURE
THE L.A. MORTICIANS

08:46.530 --> 08:48.327
ARE A LOT MORE FUN
THAN THE GUYS FROM MONTANA.

08:48.330 --> 08:51.652
YOU'RE AN L.A. MORTICIAN NOW,
NATE, THIS IS YOUR COMMUNITY.

08:51.660 --> 08:54.026
YOU KNOW, IT'S POLITE
FOR THE FIRST PERSON DOWNSTAIRS

08:54.030 --> 08:55.429
TO MAKE THE COFFEE.

08:55.430 --> 08:57.193
EVEN IF THAT PERSON
HAS A PENIS.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.997
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S ALSO
POLITE FOR THE FIRST PERSON

08:59.000 --> 09:01.059
WHO USES THE BATHROOM TO SPEND
LESS THAN 45 MINUTES IN THERE,

09:01.060 --> 09:04.154
EVEN IF THAT PERSON
HAS A VULVA.

09:05.460 --> 09:07.291
OH, GOODNESS,
EVERYONE'S HERE.

09:07.300 --> 09:08.927
WITH ALL
THEIR GENITALIA.

09:08.930 --> 09:10.352
EXCUSE ME ?

09:10.360 --> 09:11.918
MOM, WOULD YOU
LIKE SOME TOAST ?

09:11.930 --> 09:14.296
NO, THANKS, I HAVE TO BE
IN THE VALLEY BY 10:30.

09:14.300 --> 09:15.949
WHAT'S IN THE VALLEY ?

09:15.960 --> 09:17.496
I'M GOING
TO A SEMINAR.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.558
WHAT SEMINAR ?

09:18.560 --> 09:20.050
OH, SOMETHING ROBBIE
INVITED ME TO,

09:20.060 --> 09:21.152
THE PLAN ?

09:21.160 --> 09:22.696
ISN'T THAT,
LIKE, A CULT ?

09:22.700 --> 09:24.327
NO, IT'S ONE OF THOSE
SELF-ACTUALIZATION THINGS

09:24.330 --> 09:26.798
FROM THE 705 WHERE
THEY YELL AT YOU FOR 12 HOURS

09:26.800 --> 09:28.199
AND DON'T LET YOU
GO TO THE BATHROOM.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.656
OH NO, REALLY ?

09:29.660 --> 09:31.457
SHOULD I BRING
SOME KIND OF JAR ?

09:31.460 --> 09:32.495
AJAR?

09:32.500 --> 09:34.252
I SUPPOSE THAT'S
NOT MUCH OF A SOLUTION.

09:34.260 --> 09:36.797
OH, AND YOU'RE ON
YOUR OWN FOR DINNER.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.325
I WON'T BE BACK
UNTIL AFI'ER MIDNIGHT.

09:40.860 --> 09:42.623
THE THOUGHT OF MOM
BEING SELF-ACTUALIZED

09:42.630 --> 09:44.450
IS KIND OF
MAKING ME NAUSEOUS.

09:44.460 --> 09:47.190
YOU SURE IT'S NOT THE THOUGHT
OF MOM PISSING INTO A JAR ?

09:50.760 --> 09:53.422
SO, TAHIRA, WHY CAN'T YOU
FORGIVE YOUR FATHER ?

09:53.430 --> 09:57.924
WHEN I WAS 16, HE HAD A DREAM
THAT I HAD GIVEN MYSELF TO A MAN

09:57.930 --> 10:01.559
WHO WAS NOT THE HUSBAND
I HAD BEEN PROMISED TO.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.825
FOR THAT,
HE SET ME ON FIRE.

10:04.830 --> 10:07.594
I WAS ABLE
TO SAVE MYSELF,

10:07.600 --> 10:12.424
BUT I HAD TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY
SO, HE WOULD NOT KILL ME.

10:14.260 --> 10:16.421
AND ALWAYS...

10:18.460 --> 10:20.655
I WILL HAVE THE SCARS
FROM THIS.

10:20.660 --> 10:21.991
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.797
TRULY HORRIBLE.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.256
HOW COULD
HE DO THIS TO ME ?

10:25.260 --> 10:27.820
BUT AS LONG AS YOU HOLD ONTO
THAT ANGER TOWARD YOUR FATHER,

10:27.830 --> 10:30.094
YOU WILL BE ON FIRE.

10:30.100 --> 10:32.352
YOU MAY HAVE
LEFI' THE COUNTRY,

10:32.360 --> 10:35.693
BUT YOU'RE STILL
LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.349
AND IN THAT HOUSE

10:37.360 --> 10:39.794
THERE IS A ROOM
THAT IS STILL BURNING.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.199
WHO LIVES
IN THIS ROOM ?

10:41.200 --> 10:43.350
IDO?

10:43.360 --> 10:46.921
YOUR FATHER IS STILL
LIVING IN THIS ROOM.

10:46.930 --> 10:49.455
SO, YOU NEVER
INVITE ANYONE IN

10:49.460 --> 10:51.894
AND YOU GO
THROUGH LIFE ALONE.

10:51.900 --> 10:54.095
YOU MUST
OPEN THAT DOOR,

10:54.100 --> 10:55.499
PUT OUT THE FLAMES.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.718
YOU MUST INVITE YOUR FATHER
TO COME VISIT YOU.

10:57.730 --> 11:00.949
BUT HE WON'T
EVEN SPEAK TO ME.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.849
THAT IS
YOUR OLD BLUEPRINT !

11:03.860 --> 11:06.499
THAT IS WHAT
YOU WANT TO BELIEVE,

11:06.500 --> 11:08.422
BECAUSE YOU
ARE TOO AFRAID

11:08.430 --> 11:11.194
TO TEAR DOWN THE WALLS
AND REBUILD.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.599
OH, COME ON !

11:12.600 --> 11:14.056
STOP BLAMING
THE VICTIM !

11:14.060 --> 11:17.894
ALRIGHT, WHO HERE
THINKS I'M BEING UNFAIR ?

11:19.660 --> 11:21.628
BE HONEST.

11:28.330 --> 11:30.389
RUTH, DO YOU AGREE ?

11:30.400 --> 11:32.322
UNTIL TAHIRA
FORGIVES HER FATHER,

11:32.330 --> 11:36.391
SHE WILL NEVER FEEL SAFE
IN HER HOME ?

11:36.400 --> 11:38.493
WELL, MAYBE, BUT--

11:38.500 --> 11:39.626
SPEAK UP !

11:39.630 --> 11:41.325
WE ALL PAID TO HEAR YOU.

11:41.330 --> 11:43.798
WHY DON'T YOU STAND ?

11:47.360 --> 11:49.419
HER FATHER DID
SUCH A TERRIBLE THING.

11:49.430 --> 11:52.854
I DON'T SEE WHY SHE HAS
TO HAVE HIM AS A HOUSE GUEST.

11:52.860 --> 11:56.057
IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH ME,
WHY DIDN'T RAISE YOUR HAND ?

11:56.060 --> 11:58.927
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT.

11:58.930 --> 12:01.558
OR DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR
OPINION DOESN'T MATTER ?

12:01.560 --> 12:04.393
THAT PERHAPS YOU ARE
JUST A GUEST HERE ?

12:04.400 --> 12:07.426
ARE YOU A GUEST
IN YOUR OWN HOUSE, RUTH ?

12:07.430 --> 12:08.749
I DON'T THINK SO--

12:08.760 --> 12:09.692
YES.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.122
SHE TIPTOES
AROUND HERSELF

12:11.130 --> 12:13.428
LIKE SHE'S AFRAID
OF WAKING SOMEONE UP.

12:13.430 --> 12:16.024
THE ONLY PERSON SLEEPING
IN YOUR HOUSE IS YOU.

12:16.030 --> 12:17.497
WELL, I DO HAVE
THREE CHILDREN...

12:17.500 --> 12:19.149
SEE, SHE'S NOT
EVEN LISTENING.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.457
RUTH.

12:20.460 --> 12:21.825
YOU HAVE TO GET
OUT OF BED,

12:21.830 --> 12:25.698
OPEN THE WINDOWS AND LET
SOME LIGHT INTO YOUR HOUSE,

12:25.700 --> 12:28.954
SO, THAT YOU CAN
SEE THE WAY THINGS ARE.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.928
THEN AND ONLY THEN

12:30.930 --> 12:34.957
CAN YOU BEGIN
RENOVATING YOUR LIFE.

12:36.460 --> 12:37.654
SO, TAHIRA...

12:37.660 --> 12:40.299
ARE YOU READY
TO RENOVATE ?

12:40.300 --> 12:42.120
YES, I THINK SO.

12:42.130 --> 12:45.156
SO, WHEN YOU CALL YOUR FATHER,
WHAT WILL YOU SAY FIRST ?

12:45.160 --> 12:47.299
UH, HELLO ?

12:48.200 --> 12:50.395
SORRY,
MY BEAKER EXPLODED.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.924
THAT'S OKAY.

12:51.930 --> 12:53.522
CATCH YOUR BREATH.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.219
SO?

12:56.230 --> 12:58.198
HOW'S IT GOING ?

12:58.200 --> 13:01.795
UM, WELL, I HAVE
HYDROCHLORIC ACID
IN MY HAIR, BUT...

13:01.800 --> 13:03.893
OTHER THAN THAT,
I'M FINE.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.255
REALLY ?

13:06.260 --> 13:09.457
NO, BUT I'M INCREDIBLY BORED
WITH MYSELF RIGHT NOW.

13:11.260 --> 13:13.057
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.324
HOW'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND,
WHAT'S HER NAME ?

13:15.330 --> 13:16.695
JENNY.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.122
AND WE'RE FINE,
THAN KS.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.654
HOW'S IT GOING
WITH GABRIEL ?

13:19.660 --> 13:21.218
I HAVE NO IDEA.

13:21.230 --> 13:22.697
I HAVEN'T EVEN TALKED
TO HIM IN LIKE TWO WEEKS.

13:27.130 --> 13:28.256
IS THAT HER ?

13:28.260 --> 13:29.056
MM-HMM.

13:30.730 --> 13:31.628
WHAT DOES SHE DO ?

13:31.630 --> 13:33.427
SHE'S A JEWELRY DESIGNER.

13:33.430 --> 13:34.419
REALLY ?

13:34.430 --> 13:35.590
DOES SHE HAVE,
LIKE, A STORE ?

13:35.600 --> 13:37.818
NO, SHE HAS CLIENTS.

13:37.830 --> 13:39.297
AND SHE CATERS.

13:39.300 --> 13:43.350
BUT WE'RE NOT HERE
TO TALK ABOUT JENNY.

13:46.100 --> 13:47.692
LOOK, I THINK IT MIGHT HELP
TO TELL ME WHAT IT IS

13:47.700 --> 13:49.554
THAT YOU'RE GOING
THROUGH RIGHT NOW.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.926
WELL, IT'S NO
BIG FUCKING MYSTERY.

13:51.930 --> 13:54.125
I MEAN, IT SUCKS.

13:55.300 --> 13:58.599
IT SUCKS TO BE PRETTY MUCH,
YOU KNOW, IN LOVE WITH A GUY

13:58.600 --> 14:00.227
WHO'S TOO FUCKED UP
FOR LIFE, YOU KNOW ?

14:00.230 --> 14:01.993
WHAT HAPPENED ?

14:02.000 --> 14:04.195
NOTHING, REALLY, JUST...

14:04.200 --> 14:05.519
WHATEVER.

14:05.530 --> 14:07.828
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT
EVEN HIS FAULT,

14:07.830 --> 14:09.229
IT FUCKING
PISSES ME OFF.

14:09.230 --> 14:10.822
THE WHOLE THING,
HIS WHOLE FAMILY THING

14:10.830 --> 14:12.559
IS SO FUCKING UNFAIR.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.723
I REALLY JUST THOUGHT HE JUST
NEEDED, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW...

14:15.730 --> 14:16.924
YOU ?

14:16.930 --> 14:17.851
NO.

14:17.860 --> 14:19.623
BUT SOMEONE, MAYBE.

14:19.630 --> 14:21.825
YOU KNOW, SOME PERSON
ON THE PLANET

14:21.830 --> 14:23.252
WHO GIVES A FUCK
ABOUT HIM.

14:23.260 --> 14:24.591
FOR ONCE IN HIS LIFE,

14:24.600 --> 14:26.227
YEAH, I DID THINK
MAYBE THAT WOULD MATI'ER.

14:26.230 --> 14:27.356
IT DOES MATTER.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.557
BUT NO ONE CAN EVER SOLVE
SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE.

14:30.560 --> 14:33.597
SO, BASICALLY YOUR JOB
IS TOTALLY POINTLESS.

14:35.100 --> 14:38.354
NO ONE, BUT
A GUIDANCE COUNSELOR,
I MEAN.

14:42.860 --> 14:43.792
THERE THEY ARE.

14:43.800 --> 14:44.949
THAT'S THE
"COMMUNITY" ?

14:44.960 --> 14:46.325
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE AN EVENT.

14:46.330 --> 14:47.729
OH, IT'S AN EVENT.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.518
DIDN'T I MEET ONE OF
THOSE GUYS IN VEGAS ?

14:53.530 --> 14:55.225
BOBO FROM
PEACEFUL HAVEN.

14:55.230 --> 14:57.221
RIGHT, HE SPITS.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.424
YES, HE DOES.

14:58.430 --> 14:59.522
HEY !

14:59.530 --> 15:00.895
STAN, JACK, BOBO,

15:00.900 --> 15:02.720
THIS IS MY BROTHER, NATE.

15:02.730 --> 15:04.322
NICE TO SEE YA, NATE.

15:04.330 --> 15:05.524
NICE TO MEET YOU, JACK.

15:05.530 --> 15:06.554
BOBO.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.096
GOOD SEEING YOU, BOBO.

15:08.100 --> 15:12.025
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS, WE HEARD
YOU JUST GOT YOUR LICENSE

15:12.030 --> 15:14.351
TO OPERATE
A MOVING FUNERAL.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.624
YEP, FINALLY WENT PRO.

15:16.630 --> 15:18.029
SIT, SIT, SIT !

15:18.030 --> 15:18.997
OH, NO, GO AHEAD.

15:19.000 --> 15:19.921
AFTER YOU.

15:19.930 --> 15:20.897
AGE BEFORE BEAUTY.

15:20.900 --> 15:22.026
RIGHT.

15:22.030 --> 15:23.190
YEAH, SO,
DAVID TELLS US

15:23.200 --> 15:25.418
THAT YOU
ARE VERY GIFTED.

15:25.430 --> 15:27.022
HE DOES ?

15:27.030 --> 15:30.352
WE WERE JUST GIVING STAN GRIEF
FOR PO-POACHING OUR CUSTOMERS

15:30.360 --> 15:32.521
WITH FALSE ADVERTISING.

15:32.530 --> 15:35.749
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
KROEHNER WOULD DO.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.694
FUCKING KROEHNER.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.998
THOSE COCKSUCKERS !

15:40.000 --> 15:43.128
SORRY, THOSE CUNTS.

15:43.130 --> 15:45.758
SO, THIS FAMILY
GOES OFF THE 405,

15:45.760 --> 15:47.751
WE GET FIVE BODIES,
RIGHT ?

15:47.760 --> 15:51.298
TRUTH, MY WALK-IN
ONLY HOLDS THREE.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.860
SO, MY GUY'S WORKING OVERTIME
TO GET EVERYONE JUICED,

15:53.860 --> 15:56.590
BUT SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE
TO LEAVE 'EM OUT AN HOUR OR TWO

15:56.600 --> 15:59.649
BEYOND REGULATION,
IT HAPPENS, RIGHT ?

15:59.660 --> 16:01.628
BUT THOSE
KROEHNER FUCKS,

16:01.630 --> 16:03.495
THEY'RE JUST
WAITING FOR A CHANCE

16:03.500 --> 16:06.196
TO SEND IN THEIR FLACKY
AT THE DCA, AND BOOM,

16:06.200 --> 16:09.089
I GET HIT WITH
A GIANT FINE AND A LAWSUIT.

16:09.100 --> 16:13.252
I WILL RAM A PLASTIC SCREW
UP MY ANUS

16:13.260 --> 16:14.955
BEFORE I GIVE IN
TO THOSE FUCKS.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.258
NO OFFENSE.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.419
DO WE HAVE A WAITRESS ?

16:20.430 --> 16:23.126
SHE'LL BE BACK
WITH THE FRIES.

16:23.130 --> 16:24.825
THOSE FUCKS.

16:24.830 --> 16:26.627
THEY ARE FUCKS.

16:26.630 --> 16:28.951
THEY'RE FUCKING
EVIL FUCKS !

16:28.960 --> 16:30.723
THEY'RE SUCKING UP
ALL THE MOM AND POPS.

16:30.730 --> 16:33.392
I MEAN, BUSINESSES PEOPLE
SPENT THEIR LIVES BUILDING--

16:33.400 --> 16:34.651
THEY DON'T CARE
ABOUT PEOPLE.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.820
THEY DON'T CARE
ABOUT LIVES--

16:35.830 --> 16:36.728
ALRIGHT, NATE.

16:36.730 --> 16:37.958
WE APPRECIATE
YOUR PASSION, BUT--

16:37.960 --> 16:40.224
NO, NO, NO, NO,
ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS MONEY.

16:40.230 --> 16:41.549
AND IT'S NOT
JUST OUR INDUSTRY.

16:41.560 --> 16:42.891
IT'S EVERYWHERE.

16:42.900 --> 16:45.653
WHEN CORPORATIONS TRY AND
SQUEEZE OUT ALL THE COMPETITORS,

16:45.660 --> 16:47.321
THE FURTHER MANAGEMENT
GETS FROM LABOR,

16:47.330 --> 16:49.059
THE MORE ALIENATION
THERE IS IN THE WORKPLACE

16:49.060 --> 16:51.199
AND THE MORE MEANINGLESS
ALL OUR LIVES BECOME.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.394
FUCK, YEAH !

16:52.400 --> 16:53.549
IT'S H-HOPELESS,
ISN'T IT ?

16:53.560 --> 16:54.788
NO, NO,
I DON'T THINK IT IS.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.654
BUT WE HAVE
TO STICK TOGETHER

16:56.660 --> 16:58.628
AND SAVE OUR ENERGY TO FIGHT
KROEHNER, YOU KNOW, STAN ?

16:58.630 --> 17:00.791
YES, YES,
I LOVE THIS GUY !

17:00.800 --> 17:02.449
TERRIFIC, TERRIFIC !

17:02.460 --> 17:03.688
TERRIFIC !

17:03.700 --> 17:06.260
ALRIGHT.

17:07.830 --> 17:09.525
I DON'T KNOW, GARY,
TWICE IN ONE DAY ?

17:09.530 --> 17:11.589
CLAIRE, THIS IS...

17:11.600 --> 17:14.023
DETECTIVE REECE.

17:14.030 --> 17:16.555
WHY DON'T YOU
SIT DOWN, CLAIRE ?

17:22.800 --> 17:24.495
ANY IDEA WHERE
GABRIEL DIMAS IS ?

17:24.500 --> 17:26.525
WHY WOULD I ?

17:26.530 --> 17:28.327
HE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS,
ISN'T HE ?

17:28.330 --> 17:29.888
YEAH, BUT...

17:29.900 --> 17:31.993
IT'S NOT LIKE I KNOW WHERE
HE IS EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.922
YOU HAVE NOTICED THAT
HE HASN'T BEEN IN SCHOOL

17:33.930 --> 17:35.249
FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

17:35.260 --> 17:37.125
YEAH, BUT I DON'T
KNOW WHERE HE IS.

17:38.360 --> 17:39.759
I DON'T.

17:39.760 --> 17:43.719
DID YOU KNOW THAT HE HELD UP
A CONVENIENCE STORE
WITH A GUN ?

17:45.200 --> 17:46.690
NO.

17:46.700 --> 17:49.089
DID YOU GIVE OR SELL HIM
EMBALMING FLUID ?

17:49.100 --> 17:50.226
NO.

17:50.230 --> 17:51.629
GOD.

17:51.630 --> 17:53.222
SO, HOW DO YOU THINK
HE GOT IT ?

17:53.230 --> 17:55.255
I DON'T KNOW.

17:55.260 --> 17:56.625
THE INTERNET ?

17:56.630 --> 17:58.518
DON'T THEY HAVE CATALOGS
FOR THAT STUFF ?

17:58.530 --> 17:59.599
MAYBE,

17:59.600 --> 18:01.750
BUT IT'D BE A LOT EASIER
TO GET IT FROM YOU,

18:01.760 --> 18:04.422
DON'T YOU THINK ?

18:04.430 --> 18:06.819
NO, BECAUSE I WOULD NEVER
DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

18:06.830 --> 18:09.799
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE THEY KEEP THAT STUFF.

18:14.330 --> 18:16.423
( door closing )

18:20.300 --> 18:22.495
SO, IT'S BETWEEN
"ETHICS OF EVOLUTION,"

18:22.500 --> 18:24.354
AND "BIO-GENETICS,"
I THINK.

18:24.360 --> 18:25.827
BIOGENETICS,
REALLY ?

18:25.830 --> 18:27.354
WHAT ?

18:27.360 --> 18:30.227
WELL, YAWN,
KIND OF, RIGHT ?

18:30.230 --> 18:33.449
"BIOGENETICS"
MIGHT SOUND DULL TO YOU,

18:33.460 --> 18:35.189
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY
VERY SMUTTY.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.896
IT'S ALL ABOUT
SPERM COMPETITION,

18:37.900 --> 18:40.289
AND CRYPTIC OVULATION.

18:40.300 --> 18:41.449
OH, YEAH ?

18:41.460 --> 18:43.257
WHAT ELSE
ARE YOU TAKING ?

18:43.260 --> 18:44.955
I'M ONLY
DOING ONE CLASS.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.099
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

18:47.100 --> 18:49.921
I SAID I WAS GONNA
TAKE A CLASS.

18:49.930 --> 18:52.148
I STILL HAVE TO WORK,
YOU KNOW.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.650
FUCK, IF IT'S
ONLY ONE CLASS,

18:53.660 --> 18:55.252
WHY NOT PICK
SOMETHING INTERESTING ?

18:55.260 --> 18:58.024
HOW ABOUT THIS
RELIGIOUS STUDIES CLASS,

18:58.030 --> 19:00.624
"CROSS CULTURAL PERSPECTIVES
ON THE AFTERLIFE" ?

19:00.630 --> 19:01.756
YAWN .

19:01.760 --> 19:03.921
IT'S NOT BORING,
IT'S SPIRITUAL.

19:03.930 --> 19:05.249
DOUBLE YAWN.

19:05.260 --> 19:06.955
WHY DON'T YOU
SIGN UP FOR THAT,

19:06.960 --> 19:08.757
AND WE CAN MEET
IN THE QUAD FOR LUNCH ?

19:08.760 --> 19:11.092
YEAH, THAT'D BE SO FUN.

19:11.100 --> 19:13.557
WE COULD MAKE OUT
IN THE STACKS,

19:13.560 --> 19:17.599
SNEAK INTO THE POOL AT NIGHT
AND GO SKINNY DIPPING ON ACID.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.694
SOUNDS LIKE YOU DID
A LOT OF WORK AT COLLEGE.

19:20.700 --> 19:22.656
I WAS ONLY IN SCHOOL
FOR TWO YEARS,

19:22.660 --> 19:23.957
BUT I LEARNED
A FEW THINGS.

19:23.960 --> 19:28.192
ABOUT BREAKING
INTO SCHOOL PROPERTY
WHILE TRIPPING.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.553
HEY...

19:29.560 --> 19:31.118
THAT'LL HELP YOU
IN LIFE.

19:31.130 --> 19:32.449
MMM...

19:36.600 --> 19:38.056
WHAT ?

19:39.660 --> 19:41.855
OH, COME ON, BREN...

19:41.860 --> 19:45.057
I WAS JUST
IN THE MIDDLE SOMETHING.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.891
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

19:46.900 --> 19:48.390
NOT THAT LONG.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.755
WELL, IT'S BEEN
THREE AND A HALF WEEKS.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.455
AND ON TUESDAY
IT'LL BE FOUR WEEKS.

19:52.460 --> 19:53.996
NOT THAT
YOU'RE COUNTING.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.321
YEAH, I'M COUNTING.

19:56.330 --> 19:57.797
I MEAN, HAVE YOU
NOT EVEN NOTICED ?

19:57.800 --> 20:00.451
YOU KNOW IT'S NORMAL,
AFTER A CERTAIN POINT,

20:00.460 --> 20:01.825
FOR SEX TO SLOW DOWN.

20:01.830 --> 20:03.889
YEAH, SLOW DOWN, OKAY,
BUT STOP ?

20:03.900 --> 20:07.449
PEOPLE CAN GO MONTHS
AFTER A CERTAIN POINT.

20:07.460 --> 20:10.850
AFTER A CERTAIN POINT, OKAY,
LIKE SIX YEARS, MAYBE.

20:10.860 --> 20:12.191
BUT SIX MONTHS ?

20:12.200 --> 20:13.349
SEVEN.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.918
NOT THAT
YOU'RE COUNTING.

20:17.230 --> 20:19.596
LISTEN, NATE, YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN WITH ANYBODY LONG ENOUGH

20:19.600 --> 20:21.750
TO KNOW THIS,
BUT THERE IS A CERTAIN...

20:21.760 --> 20:23.625
EBB AND FLOW
THAT HAPPENS.

20:23.630 --> 20:25.689
WELL, NOT FOR EVERYBODY.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.429
IT DOES.

20:27.430 --> 20:30.820
THERE WILL BE TIMES
WHEN YOU'RE NOT
ATTRACT ED TO ME AT ALL.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.429
IT'S JUST
A NORMAL EBB.

20:34.430 --> 20:38.059
WELL, HOW LONG DOES
A NORMAL EBB LAST ?

20:38.060 --> 20:39.994
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I THINK
THAT'S THE KIND OF QUESTION

20:40.000 --> 20:42.252
THAT PROLONGS
THE STANDARD EBB.

20:42.260 --> 20:45.559
(sighing )

20:53.830 --> 20:56.526
(female on tv)
except for hat and gloves.

20:56.530 --> 20:58.293
And this nurse came up
to him and said...

20:58.300 --> 21:00.256
MOM ?

21:00.260 --> 21:02.228
OH!

21:08.830 --> 21:11.253
IT'S SO LATE,
I WAS KIND OF WORRIED.

21:11.260 --> 21:12.796
IT GOES
UNTIL MIDNIGHT.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.552
WAS IT FUN ?

21:14.560 --> 21:17.154
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

21:17.160 --> 21:20.220
SO, YOU'RE NOT
GOING BACK.

21:20.230 --> 21:21.720
OH, I'M GOING BACK.

21:21.730 --> 21:23.152
WHY ?

21:23.160 --> 21:26.425
I DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T WANT TO BE RUDE.

21:26.430 --> 21:29.194
MOM, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT,
THEY ALREADY GOT YOUR MONEY.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.350
WELL, THERE'S THAT TOO.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.056
Don't you get bored
around here ?

21:37.060 --> 21:39.995
Well, sometimes.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.152
WELL, DO YOU WANT SOME
LIKE TEA, OR SOMETHING ?

21:44.530 --> 21:47.351
ALRIGHT,
WHAT DID YOU BREAK ?

21:47.360 --> 21:49.055
NOTHING !

21:49.060 --> 21:51.358
I WAS JUST BEING NICE.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.952
GOD.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.791
I'M SORRY.

21:57.860 --> 22:01.352
I WAS IMPOSING
MY OLD BLUEPRINT ON YOU.

22:04.030 --> 22:05.429
EXCUSE ME ?

22:05.430 --> 22:08.126
IN THE OLD BLUEPRINT
OF MY OLD HOUSE,

22:08.130 --> 22:11.691
YOU'RE ONLY NICE TO ME WHEN
YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING BAD.

22:11.700 --> 22:14.260
OR WHEN
YOU WANT SOMETHING.

22:14.260 --> 22:17.798
WELL, THAT MAKES ME
FEEL LIKE SHIT.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.256
I'M SORRY.

22:19.260 --> 22:22.195
BUT IT REALLY DOES
SEEM THAT WAY TO ME.

22:30.060 --> 22:31.721
WELL, I SHOULD
GO DO MY HOMEWORK.

22:31.730 --> 22:34.358
THEY GAVE YOU
HOMEWORK ?

22:34.360 --> 22:35.827
UGH !

22:35.830 --> 22:38.298
I HAVE TO WRITE A LETTER
TO MY DEAD MOTHER

22:38.300 --> 22:41.155
AND FORGIVE HER
FOR ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS
SHE DID TO ME.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.822
THAT SOUNDS FUN.

22:43.830 --> 22:46.651
AND THEN, I HAVE TO WRITE
A PRIVATE LETTER TO MYSELF

22:46.660 --> 22:50.118
OUTLINING HOW I WANT
TO RENOVATE MY LIFE.

22:51.330 --> 22:53.150
GOODNIGHT, DEAR.

22:54.660 --> 22:56.196
GOODNIGHT.

22:58.160 --> 23:00.196
(sighing )

23:00.200 --> 23:02.794
The shovel's
in the truck.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.597
( gunshot )

23:23.030 --> 23:24.452
THAT'S GOOD.

23:24.460 --> 23:26.291
UH, RICO, YOU FORGET
SOMETHING THERE ?

23:29.200 --> 23:32.795
OH, SHIT !

23:34.100 --> 23:35.522
SORRY, MAN.

23:35.530 --> 23:37.395
I GOT ABOUT TWO HOURS
OF SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.799
AUGUSTO ?

23:38.800 --> 23:39.926
NO, ANGIE.

23:39.930 --> 23:41.192
VAN ESSA'S SISTER.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.622
SHE WALKS OUT
ON HER BOYFRIEND

23:42.630 --> 23:44.325
AND COMES OVER TO WAIL IN
OUR LIVING ROOM ALL NIGHT LONG.

23:44.330 --> 23:46.252
WOMEN.

23:46.260 --> 23:47.522
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN.

23:47.530 --> 23:49.054
SHE SHOWS UP
WITH THIS SUITCASE,

23:49.060 --> 23:50.550
LIKE SHE'S GOT SOME RIGHT,
NOW THAT--

23:50.560 --> 23:54.291
SHE HAS ALL THESE
FANCY HOLLYWOOD FRIENDS

23:54.300 --> 23:56.495
WHO FLASH THEIR MONEY
AROUND ALL THE TIME,

23:56.500 --> 23:59.128
I'M LIKE, YOU CAN'T GO SOMEWHERE
THERE'S A GUEST ROOM ?

24:00.900 --> 24:03.460
RICO, I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THAT LOAN.

24:03.460 --> 24:06.520
IT'S JUST A REALLY
TIGHT BUDGET, YOU KNOW ?

24:06.530 --> 24:07.997
IT'S OKAY.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.198
WE GOT THE HOUSE,
SOMETHING ELSE CAME THROUGH.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.497
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.456
YEP, ESCROW CLOSES
NEXT MONTH.

24:15.460 --> 24:16.552
WOW.

24:16.560 --> 24:17.959
THAT'S SUPER, MAN.

24:17.960 --> 24:20.952
HEY, YOU AND...

24:20.960 --> 24:23.428
VANESSA HAVE BEEN TOGETHER,
WHAT, LIKE...

24:23.430 --> 24:24.988
FIVE YEARS NOW ?

24:25.000 --> 24:26.524
MARRIED FIVE,
TOGETHER EIGHT.

24:26.530 --> 24:28.851
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THAT SHIT ?

24:30.760 --> 24:32.955
OKAY, SO, THIS IS SORT OF
A PERSONAL QUESTION.

24:32.960 --> 24:35.451
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ANSWER, BUT...

24:36.830 --> 24:38.195
DO YOU GUYS STILL...

24:41.260 --> 24:44.024
PRETTY MUCH,
HAVE SEX ?

24:47.000 --> 24:47.955
WELL, YOU KNOW.

24:47.960 --> 24:49.757
WE GOT TWO KIDS NOW.

24:49.760 --> 24:50.988
SO, IT SLOWS
DOWN A BIT.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.127
RIGHT, RIGHT.

24:54.460 --> 24:55.688
HOW SLOW ?

24:55.700 --> 24:58.954
WELL, RIGHT AFTER THE BABY,

24:58.960 --> 25:01.326
VANESSA'S GOT ALL THE WRONG
HORMONES AND STUFF, SO...

25:01.330 --> 25:03.855
NOW, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE...

25:03.860 --> 25:07.250
THREE OR FOUR
TIMES A WEEK.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.753
WOW.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.523
THAT'S TOO BAD, MAN.

25:14.530 --> 25:16.657
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
THAT SUCKS.

25:16.660 --> 25:19.128
IT'S NOT LIKE
THE FIRST FEW YEARS.

25:19.130 --> 25:21.928
YEAH, YOU BETTER ENJOY IT
WHILE YOU GOT IT.

25:21.930 --> 25:24.490
NO KIDDING, RIGHT ?

25:28.300 --> 25:29.949
THIS MORON
ALWAYS GOES OVER.

25:29.960 --> 25:33.555
I OUGHTA GO IN
AND CORRECT HIS SELFISH ASS.

25:33.560 --> 25:36.529
LET THEM FINISH THEIR GAME,
WE GO OVER SOMETIMES.

25:47.160 --> 25:48.718
SO, HOW'S EDDIE ?

25:48.730 --> 25:50.220
HE'S GOOD.

25:50.230 --> 25:53.028
THINGS ARE GOOD,
I GUESS.

25:59.460 --> 26:01.394
KEITH,
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

26:01.400 --> 26:05.689
I THINK MY SISTER IS FUCKING
USING THAT SHIT AGAIN.

26:08.830 --> 26:10.957
MY MOM'S COME UP FROM
SAN DIEGO TO WATCH OVER HER,

26:10.960 --> 26:12.723
LIKE THAT'S GONNA
FIX ANYTHING.

26:12.730 --> 26:14.755
ACCORDING TO HER,
EVERYTHING IS JUST FINE NOW

26:14.760 --> 26:17.399
AND I'M THE ONE
THAT'S OVERREACTING.

26:17.400 --> 26:21.393
I DON'T THINK
YOU WERE OVERREACTING.

26:23.430 --> 26:25.352
THAN KS.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.722
EDDIE HATES
RACQUETBALL.

26:34.730 --> 26:36.095
REALLY, WHY ?

26:36.100 --> 26:37.829
POOR DEPTH PERCEPTION.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.092
HMM.

26:39.100 --> 26:41.751
CAN'T PLAY POOL EITHER.

26:43.900 --> 26:45.527
THAT'S TOO BAD.

26:54.100 --> 26:56.989
LET'S NOT BEAT
AROUND THE BUSH, SHALL WE ?

26:57.000 --> 26:59.651
BIOLOGY HAS A LONG HISTORY
OF BEING ABUSED

26:59.660 --> 27:03.494
AS AN IDEOLOGICAL INSTRUMENT
TO JUSTIFY SOCIAL INEQUITIES

27:03.500 --> 27:05.024
AND AMORAL BEHAVIOR.

27:05.030 --> 27:06.793
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE
NOT YET READ MY BOOK...

27:06.800 --> 27:10.452
THE CENTRAL ARGUMENT I POSIT
IN GENES OUT OF THE BOTTLE,

27:10.460 --> 27:12.223
EVOLUTION AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,

27:12.230 --> 27:15.996
IS THAT GENETIC ENGINEERING IS,
IN AND OF ITSELF,

27:16.000 --> 27:20.448
THE MOST EFFECTIVE ARGUMENT
AGAINST BIOLOGICAL DETERMINISM.

27:20.460 --> 27:21.757
WHY ?

27:21.760 --> 27:24.092
THE THESIS THAT
YOU PRESENT SO BRILLIANTLY

27:24.100 --> 27:26.989
IS THAT THOUGH BIOLOGY
MANIFESTS IN BEHAVIOR

27:27.000 --> 27:29.150
AS WE CAN SEE
IN THE INSTINCT
OF HUMAN MALES

27:29.160 --> 27:31.355
TO SEEK A VARIETY
OF SEXUAL PARTNERS,

27:31.360 --> 27:34.989
THE FACT THAT
WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY
TO MODIFY GENETICS

27:35.000 --> 27:37.560
CONFIRMS THE SUPREMACY
OF CULTURE OVER BIOLOGY.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.255
EXCELLENT.

27:39.260 --> 27:40.522
OTHER THOUGHTS ?

27:40.530 --> 27:43.226
I HAVE A QUESTION.

27:43.230 --> 27:46.256
ISN'T NATURAL SELECTION
STILL OPERATING, THOUGH ?

27:46.260 --> 27:47.659
SINCE MEMBERS
OF THE SPECIES

27:47.660 --> 27:49.548
WHO HAVE ACCESS
TO GENETIC TECHNOLOGIES

27:49.560 --> 27:52.199
ARE MORE LIKELY
TO SURVIVE AND PROCREATE ?

27:52.200 --> 27:54.555
WELL, THAT KIND
OF REASONING

27:54.560 --> 27:57.028
LEADS US INTO A VERY
QUESTIONABLE ETHICAL TERRAIN.

27:57.030 --> 27:58.588
OTHER COMMENTS ?

27:58.600 --> 28:00.227
WELL, WHAT KIND
OF REASONING ?

28:00.230 --> 28:01.322
SCIENTIFIC ?

28:01.330 --> 28:02.649
YOU CAN CALL IT SCIENTIFIC,
BUT AS I DISCUSS

28:02.660 --> 28:04.093
AT GREAT LENGTH
IN CHAPTER TWO,

28:04.100 --> 28:06.193
YOUR ARGUMENT
IS A POLITICAL ASSERTION

28:06.200 --> 28:08.589
THAT PRIVILEGE IS
BIOLOGICALLY DETERMINED.

28:08.600 --> 28:10.056
I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY
READ YOUR BOOK,

28:10.060 --> 28:12.494
BUT YOU CAN'T TELL ME THAT
SURVIVAL ISN'T EASIER FOR PEOPLE

28:12.500 --> 28:15.458
WHO ARE BORN WITH A PRIVATE CHEF
AND HEALTH INSURANCE.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.690
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
READ THE BOOK

28:17.700 --> 28:19.895
BEFORE COMMENTING
ON ITS THESIS.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.849
OTHER COMMENTS ?

28:22.860 --> 28:24.225
YES ?

28:24.230 --> 28:26.221
EXCUSE ME,
I'M SORRY,

28:26.230 --> 28:28.118
ARE WE NOT ALLOWED
TO DISAGREE WITH YOU ?

28:28.130 --> 28:30.451
I'M JUST ASKING,
'CAUSE I'M NEW IN THE CLASS.

28:30.460 --> 28:32.428
WELL, WE CERTAINLY DON'T
INTERRUPT OUR CLASSMATES.

28:32.430 --> 28:34.022
GO AHEAD.

28:34.030 --> 28:35.691
UM...

28:35.700 --> 28:38.999
WELL, IN YOUR DISCUSSION OF
BISEXUAL GENITAL RUBBING

28:39.000 --> 28:40.228
AMONG PYGMIE CHIMPS...

28:40.230 --> 28:41.822
YOU NOTE THE EXCHANGE
OF SEX FOR MEAT.

28:41.830 --> 28:44.754
AND WELL, I WAS WONDERING
HOW THIS MIGHT PERTAIN

28:44.760 --> 28:46.648
TO CONTEMPORARY
HUMAN BEHAVIOR.

28:46.660 --> 28:48.196
ANY TH EORIES ?

28:48.200 --> 28:49.394
IN CHAPTER...

28:53.930 --> 28:58.026
SO, WHERE DO YOU
THINK HE IS NOW ?

28:58.030 --> 29:02.148
ACCORDING TO HIS WIFE,
HE'S STILL HERE.

29:02.160 --> 29:05.493
WELL, THERE'S A BIG CHUNK OF
DEAD MEAT IN A CHEAP-O BOX

29:05.500 --> 29:07.297
THAT'S STILL HERE.

29:07.300 --> 29:09.894
BUT DO YOU REALLY
BELIEVE THAT'S HIM ?

29:09.900 --> 29:11.959
THE ESSENCE OF
WHO HE WAS ?

29:11.960 --> 29:14.326
THE PART OF HIM
THAT HOPED AND DREAMED

29:14.330 --> 29:16.150
AND ALL THAT
OTHER CRAP ?

29:16.160 --> 29:19.391
YOU TELL ME, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO HAS ALL THE ANSWERS NOW.

29:19.400 --> 29:20.856
I NEVER SAID THAT.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.623
YOU'D THINK
GETTING HAMMERED BY A BUS

29:22.630 --> 29:25.952
WOULD MAKE YOU
A LITTLE LESS OF A DICK.

29:25.960 --> 29:30.158
SURE, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
WE GO ON AFTER WE DIE...

29:31.100 --> 29:33.853
BUT IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE
THAT ONCE THE LIGHT GOES OUT,

29:33.860 --> 29:35.589
IT STAYS OUT.

29:35.600 --> 29:38.956
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW, BUDDY-BOY,
'TIL IT'S YOUR TURN.

29:38.960 --> 29:41.520
SEE, THAT'S WHAT
YOU WERE HANGING ON TO.

29:41.530 --> 29:43.418
EXCUSE ME ?

29:43.430 --> 29:45.853
MICHAEL.

29:45.860 --> 29:46.997
IS HE HERE ?

29:47.000 --> 29:48.797
HE'S BEEN WITH ME
THE WHOLE TIME.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.792
YOU THINK
HE'LL STAY WITH YOU ?

29:51.800 --> 29:53.654
NOT LIKE THIS.

29:53.660 --> 29:57.118
HE'S JUST HELPING ME
GET USED TO IT.

29:59.200 --> 30:00.895
DO YOU-- LOOK,
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND,

30:00.900 --> 30:04.449
BUT DO YOU GET A SENSE OF
MY FATHER, AT ALL, AROUND HERE ?

30:19.060 --> 30:21.119
NO, I'M SORRY.

30:21.130 --> 30:23.018
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN HE'S NOT HERE.

30:23.030 --> 30:24.395
THIS ROOM IS PACKED.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.721
I CAN'T GET
TO EVERYONE.

30:28.330 --> 30:29.729
I THINK EVERYTHING
IS READY.

30:29.730 --> 30:34.121
I DO SEE A CHILD
COMING INTO YOUR LIFE.

30:34.130 --> 30:35.597
NO.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.022
IT MIGHT BE YOU.

30:37.030 --> 30:39.123
OH, I SERIOUSLY
DOUBT THAT.

30:39.130 --> 30:41.792
WELL, I'M NOT SURE
WHICH ONE OF YOU I'M READING.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.918
BUT I'M QUITE SURE THERE'S GONNA
BE A CHILD HERE VERY SOON.

30:45.930 --> 30:49.457
HEY, I'M HEADING
OUT NOW, OKAY ?

30:49.460 --> 30:52.452
THIS IS FEDERICO DIAZ,
OUR EMBALMER.

30:52.460 --> 30:54.291
AND HIS BABY, AUGUSTO.

30:54.300 --> 30:55.927
THIS IS MRS. PIPER.

30:55.930 --> 30:57.852
OH, OH, HI.

30:57.860 --> 30:59.657
I'M SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

30:59.660 --> 31:00.592
THANK YOU.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.522
YOU MADE HIS BODY
LOOK VERY NICE.

31:02.530 --> 31:03.997
THANK YOU.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.218
ACTUALLY, HIS BODY
GAVE ME A LOT TO WORK WITH.

31:06.230 --> 31:08.892
HARDLY ANY DECAY
FOR A CANCER DEATH.

31:08.900 --> 31:10.094
IT'S USUALLY--

31:10.100 --> 31:11.954
OKAY, RICO,
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

31:11.960 --> 31:13.496
YEAH, OKAY,
NICE TO MEET YOU, MA'AM.

31:13.500 --> 31:16.151
( baby crying )

31:16.160 --> 31:17.821
LET'S GO.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.791
HERE WE GO.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.696
EILEEN ASKED THAT I CLOSE
WITH A READING

31:28.700 --> 31:31.521
FROM MICHAEL'S FAVORITE POET,
WALT WHITMAN.

31:34.130 --> 31:36.724
"WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS BECOME
OF THE YOUNG AND OLD MEN ?

31:36.730 --> 31:38.357
"AND WHAT DO YOU THINK

31:38.360 --> 31:40.453
"HAS BECOME OF
THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN ?

31:40.460 --> 31:43.588
"THEY ARE ALIVE
AND WELL SOMEWHERE,

31:43.600 --> 31:47.252
"THE SMALLEST SPROUT SHOWS
THERE IS REALLY NO DEATH,

31:47.260 --> 31:50.320
"AND IF EVER THERE WAS
IT LED FORWARD LIFE,

31:50.330 --> 31:52.457
"AND DOES NOT WAIT
AT THE END TO ARREST IT,

31:52.460 --> 31:55.224
"AND CEASED THE MOMENT
LIFE APPEARED.

31:55.230 --> 31:57.892
"ALL GOES ONWARD
AND OUTWARD,

31:57.900 --> 31:59.424
"NOTHING COLLAPSES,

31:59.430 --> 32:01.250
"AND TO DIE
IS DIFFERENT

32:01.260 --> 32:03.649
"FROM WHAT
ANYONE SUPPOSED,

32:03.660 --> 32:06.026
AND LUCKIER."

32:07.660 --> 32:09.651
LET US PRAY.

32:11.430 --> 32:15.548
OH, LORD, BLESS THE DEPARTED
SOUL OF OUR BROTHER, FRIEND...

32:15.560 --> 32:19.599
I'M JUST HANGING AROUND
TO HELP YOU GET USED IT.

32:19.600 --> 32:22.421
I AM USED TO IT, DAD,
IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS.

32:22.430 --> 32:23.897
SEVEN.

32:23.900 --> 32:26.357
NOT THAT
YOU'RE COUNTING.

32:31.130 --> 32:32.927
AMEN.

32:32.930 --> 32:35.023
( together )
AMEN.

32:43.900 --> 32:45.299
HEY.

32:45.300 --> 32:47.393
HEY, ARE YOU DONE ?

32:47.400 --> 32:48.594
PRETTY MUCH,
WHAT'S UP ?

32:48.600 --> 32:51.398
WELL, I WANTED
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

32:51.400 --> 32:52.526
OKAY.

32:52.530 --> 32:54.350
GET THIS,
BOBO SOLD TO KROEHNER.

32:54.360 --> 32:56.999
BOBO SOLD,
MY BOBO ?

32:57.000 --> 32:58.297
YOUR BOBO.

32:58.300 --> 33:01.952
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS,
HE WAS SO COMMITTED.

33:02.430 --> 33:05.957
YOU THINK HE'S GOT
A PLASTIC SCREW
IN HIS ANUS ABOUT NOW ?

33:05.960 --> 33:06.995
I HOPE SO.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.025
SONOFABITCH,
I'M GONNA GO CALL HIM.

33:12.330 --> 33:14.195
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU ?

33:14.200 --> 33:15.622
NOTHING.

33:20.130 --> 33:21.358
WHERE'S KARLA ?

33:21.360 --> 33:23.055
SHE'S JUST
WORKING LATE.

33:23.060 --> 33:24.391
WHY YOU FRONTIN' ?

33:24.400 --> 33:26.857

33:26.860 --> 33:29.294
MAMA HASN'T
BEEN HOME SINCE TUESDAY.

33:29.300 --> 33:30.790

33:30.800 --> 33:32.097

33:32.100 --> 33:33.556
BUT MY STOMACH HURTS.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.323
I'LL GET YOU
SOME PEPTO BISMOL.

33:35.330 --> 33:37.491
I DON'T WANT NONE OF
THAT NASTY SHIT.

33:37.500 --> 33:39.252
THEN GO ON.

33:39.260 --> 33:42.525
SHIT, BITCH,
I GOTTA GET MY GOODS !

33:42.530 --> 33:45.397
HEY, DON'T TALK
TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER LIKE THAT.

33:45.400 --> 33:49.097
"DON'T TALK TO
YOUR GRANDMOTHER LIKE THAT."

33:49.100 --> 33:50.055
( door slamming )

33:50.060 --> 33:51.254
SHE'S SICK ?

33:51.260 --> 33:52.591
SHE SAYS
THAT EVERY NIGHT.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.192
SHE JUST
WANTS THE ATTENTION.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.599
CAN YOU BLAME HER ?

33:55.600 --> 33:57.659
HER MOTHER'S OFF DOING
GOD KNOWS WHATEVER.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.093
KARLA'S FINE.

33:59.100 --> 34:00.727
SHE JUST HAD
TO GO OUT OF TOWN.

34:00.730 --> 34:01.992
OH, YOU TALKED TO HER ?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.558
I WASN'T IN
WHEN SHE CALLED.

34:03.560 --> 34:04.822
BUT SHE LEFT
SEVERAL MESSAGES.

34:04.830 --> 34:06.855
BESIDES, I'M HERE
WITH TAYLOR.

34:06.860 --> 34:08.828
DON'T BLOW THIS OUT OF
PROPORTION LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

34:08.830 --> 34:11.219
( beeping )
Hey, Mama.

34:11.230 --> 34:13.095
I'm not coming
home tonight.

34:13.100 --> 34:14.692
Derrick needs
his papers...

34:14.700 --> 34:16.952
CAN'T SHE SEND HIM
HIS PAPERS ?

34:16.960 --> 34:18.621
WELL, YOU REMEMBER
HOW DERRICK WAS,

34:18.630 --> 34:21.155
ALWAYS GETTING HER
TO DO THIS AND THAT FOR HIM.

34:21.160 --> 34:24.197
YEAH, LIKE RAISE HIS KID
WITHOUT A DIME FROM HIM.

34:24.200 --> 34:26.088
Sorry, I dropped
the phone.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.328
Shut up.

34:27.330 --> 34:28.558
Anyway,

34:28.560 --> 34:29.959
I'll call you
as soon as I can.

34:29.960 --> 34:31.222
Okay ?

34:31.230 --> 34:33.596
OKAY, WE CAN GET
THE PHONE COMPANY RECORDS,

34:33.600 --> 34:36.524
BUT I'LL HAVE TO FILE
A MISSING PERSONS REPORT FIRST.

34:36.530 --> 34:39.556
KEITH, WHY MUST YOU ALWAYS
THINK THE WORST OF HER ?!

34:39.560 --> 34:41.892
LET'S JUST WAIT
'TIL SHE GETS HOME.

34:41.900 --> 34:43.458
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW--

34:43.460 --> 34:44.757
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,

34:44.760 --> 34:46.523
MOVE UP HERE AND TAKE CARE
OF HER THE REST OF YOUR LIFE ?

34:46.530 --> 34:48.725
SHE HAS A CHILD, JESUS,
SHE NEEDS HELP !

34:48.730 --> 34:50.755
AND YOU COVERING UP FOR HER
IS NOT WHAT I MEAN !

34:50.760 --> 34:52.352
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO ?

34:52.360 --> 34:54.248
I AM YOUR MOTHER

34:54.260 --> 34:56.455
AND YOU WILL
RESPECT THAT

34:56.460 --> 34:58.724
OR I WILL SMACK THE BLACK
RIGHT OFF OF YOU !

35:12.300 --> 35:14.120
HI, THERE.

35:15.260 --> 35:17.194
HI.

35:18.130 --> 35:19.927
HARD DAY ?

35:21.960 --> 35:23.518
HOW CAN YOU TELL ?

35:23.530 --> 35:26.624
I'M GOOD AT PEOPLE.

35:30.630 --> 35:31.995
ARE YOU ?

35:32.000 --> 35:34.696
GOT TO BE,
TAX LAW.

35:36.600 --> 35:37.851
I'M SCOTT.

35:37.860 --> 35:39.293
SCOTT AXELROD.

35:39.300 --> 35:40.858
CAN DACE BOUVARD.

35:40.860 --> 35:42.725
NICE TO MEET YOU,
CANDACE.

35:42.730 --> 35:45.119
ARE YOU AN ACTRESS ?

35:47.330 --> 35:49.491
OH, NO.

35:49.500 --> 35:53.891
I TEACH SIGN LANGUAGE
TO THE NEWLY DEAF.

35:54.630 --> 35:56.052
REALLY ?

36:01.530 --> 36:03.157
HOW NOBLE.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.856
OH, NO,
IT'S VERY LUCRATIVE.

36:05.860 --> 36:09.557
AND I REALLY ENJOY
COMMUNICATING WITH MY BODY.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.529
I GET THAT.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.854
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
MY FRIEND IS HERE.

36:21.860 --> 36:24.556
BUT IT'S BEEN REALLY GREAT
GETTING TO KNOW YOU, SCOTT.

36:24.560 --> 36:27.120
I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE YOU
TO DINNER SOMETIME.

36:27.130 --> 36:28.552
CAN I GIVE YOU
MY CARD ?

36:28.560 --> 36:30.198
YOU SURE CAN.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.889
HOW WAS SCHOOL ?

36:37.900 --> 36:40.391
IT WAS
A DISASTER.

36:41.930 --> 36:43.693
ALRIG HT,

36:43.700 --> 36:45.622
YOU HAVE 20 MINUTES TO DO
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT

36:45.630 --> 36:47.257
IN YOUR LIFE NOW.

36:47.260 --> 36:49.490
WHAT DID YOU WRITE TO YOURSELF
IN YOUR PRIVATE LETTER ?

36:49.500 --> 36:51.798
WHERE ARE YOU LOCKED
OUT OF YOUR OWN LIFE ?

36:51.800 --> 36:54.155
IF YOU LEARNED TODAY THAT YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR MOTHER

36:54.160 --> 36:56.390
HAS BEEN BLOCKING THE DOOR
TO YOUR HAPPINESS,

36:56.400 --> 36:58.459
THEN MAKE THAT REPAIR.

36:58.460 --> 37:00.098
RIGHT NOW !

37:00.100 --> 37:03.058
WAITING ONLY GIVES YOU
MORE CHANCES TO MAKE EXCUSES.

37:04.330 --> 37:05.558
THERE ARE PHONES
IN THE HALL.

37:05.560 --> 37:07.858
SEE YOU IN
19 MINUTES.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.594
WHERE CAN I FIND
A SNICKER'S BAR ?

37:10.600 --> 37:13.296
CAN'T YOU THINK OF
MORE PRODUCT IVE WAYS

37:13.300 --> 37:15.120
TO USE THIS TIME ?

37:15.130 --> 37:16.893
LIKE WHAT,
TAKING UP SMOKING ?

37:16.900 --> 37:19.152
WHY NOT TRY REBUILDING
WITH SOMEONE RIGHT NOW ?

37:19.160 --> 37:21.424
RUTH...

37:21.430 --> 37:24.297
I READ YOUR PRIVATE
LETTER TO YOURSELF.

37:24.300 --> 37:27.394
AND IF YOU REALLY WANT
CLOSENESS IN YOUR LIFE,

37:27.400 --> 37:29.960
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
START MAJOR RENOVATIONS.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.450
IN FACT, I WOULD GUT.

37:31.460 --> 37:32.825
YOU READ
MY PRIVATE LETTER ?

37:32.830 --> 37:34.525
WHY DON'T YOU
TRY CALLING YOUR KIDS ?

37:34.530 --> 37:36.794
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE MY KIDS ARE.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.791
AND THE LAST THING
ANY OF THEM WANTS IS

37:38.800 --> 37:40.153
FOR ME TO CALL THEM
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT

37:40.160 --> 37:42.025
SO, I CAN
PUT IN NEW FLOORING.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.258
OH, FUCK !

37:46.260 --> 37:49.297
I LOVE YOU TOO,
YOU SADISTIC OLD FUCK.

37:50.730 --> 37:52.425
START WITH CLAIRE.

37:52.430 --> 37:54.295
ONLY YOU...

37:54.300 --> 37:57.952
CAN BE THE ARCHITECT
OF YOUR LIFE.

38:15.500 --> 38:16.728
CLAIRE ?

38:16.730 --> 38:19.028
THIS IS YOUR MOTHER.

38:20.230 --> 38:23.757
YES, WELL, I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU THAT...

38:25.100 --> 38:27.955
I FEEL LIKE EVEN THOUGH I'VE
BEEN TRYING TO BE CLOSER TO YOU,

38:27.960 --> 38:30.895
IT HASN'T REALLY
BEEN WORKING.

38:32.660 --> 38:34.651
I WISH YOU FELT YOU COULD
CONFIDE IN ME.

38:34.660 --> 38:38.721
AND MAYBE YOU DON'T BECAUSE YOU
FEEL MY OPINION IS WORTHLESS.

38:40.260 --> 38:42.558
BECAUSE I DON'T
REALLY LIVE IN MY HOUSE,

38:42.560 --> 38:45.791
AND SO, I SUPPOSE

38:45.800 --> 38:48.496
THAT'S THE INFRASTRUCTURE
I BUILT.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.855
SO, I'M SORRY.

38:50.860 --> 38:52.953
AND ?

38:52.960 --> 38:56.054
AND, I LOVE YOU.

38:56.460 --> 38:59.554
THAT'S SO GOOD,
I GOTTA PEE LIKE A RACEHORSE.

39:01.430 --> 39:02.795
( male recording )
You have exceeded
the time limit !

39:02.800 --> 39:04.995
If you know the name of
the movie you'd like to see,

39:05.000 --> 39:06.991
press one now !

39:07.300 --> 39:12.522
YOU WERE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAID
ALL THAT GLITTERS ISN'T GOLD

39:14.700 --> 39:20.457
YOU WERE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAID
ALL WE ARE IS DUST IN THE WIND

39:20.460 --> 39:22.553
( phone )

39:25.160 --> 39:26.525
HELLO ?

39:26.530 --> 39:28.020
( Gabe )
Claire ?

39:28.030 --> 39:29.759
WHERE THE FUCK
HAVE YOU BEEN ?

39:29.760 --> 39:32.024
I fucked up.

39:32.030 --> 39:33.349
GABE, WHAT IS GOING ON ?

39:33.360 --> 39:37.729
Everything is all
fucked up, Claire.

39:37.730 --> 39:39.095
LOOK, IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,

39:39.100 --> 39:40.897
YOU JUST HAVE
TO CALM DOWN RIGHT NOW.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.424
I need...

39:42.430 --> 39:45.854
I need you to come
and get me, please !

39:47.230 --> 39:48.492
Please !

39:48.500 --> 39:51.719
YOU KNOW, THE COPS ARE, LIKE,
SERIOUSLY LOOKING FOR YOU.

39:51.730 --> 39:53.857
I know that, okay ?

39:53.860 --> 39:55.828
Why do you think I need you
to come out here and get me ?

39:55.830 --> 39:57.627
WHERE ARE YOU ?

39:57.630 --> 40:01.259
I'm up past
Woodland Hills.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.050
ACADEMIA IS
ONE HUGE CIRCLE JERK.

40:04.060 --> 40:06.893
ALL THESE SEQUESTERED PEOPLE
DESPERATELY DEFENDING

40:06.900 --> 40:10.199
THE ONE GOOD IDEA THEY HAVE
EVER HAD IN THEIR LIVES.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.895
SO, WHAT, THAT'S IT
FOR GOING BACK TO SCHOOL ?

40:11.900 --> 40:13.720
YEP.

40:13.730 --> 40:15.357
NEXT ?

40:21.760 --> 40:22.829
HOW WAS YOUR DAY ?

40:22.830 --> 40:24.149
IT WAS WEIRD.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.355
BURIED THAT PSYCHIC WOMAN'S
HUSBAND AND SHE WAS STILL, LIKE,

40:26.360 --> 40:27.827
TALKING TO THE GUY.

40:27.830 --> 40:29.024
OH, THAT'S SAD.

40:29.030 --> 40:30.258
NOT FOR HER, I MEAN.

40:30.260 --> 40:33.991
SHE REALLY BELIEVED
HE WAS THERE, YOU KNOW ?

40:34.000 --> 40:36.355
WELL, SHE HAS
TO SAY THAT, RIGHT ?

40:36.360 --> 40:38.658
IF SHE CLAIMS
SHE'S A PSYCHIC.

40:38.660 --> 40:40.252
YOU DON'T THINK THAT
THAT'S POSSIBLE ?

40:40.260 --> 40:42.751
WHAT ABOUT YOU SAYING THAT
THINGS HAPPEN THAT LEAVE MARKS

40:42.760 --> 40:45.797
IN PEOPLE,
IN PLACES,
IN TIME ?

40:45.800 --> 40:47.290
THAT'S PHYSICS,

40:47.300 --> 40:49.757
ENERGY AFFECTING MATTER.

40:49.760 --> 40:52.649
TALKING TO DEAD PEOPLE
IS DELUSIONAL.

40:52.660 --> 40:54.298
SO, YOU DEFINITELY
DON'T BELIEVE

40:54.300 --> 40:55.949
IN ANY KIND OF
LIFE-AFTER-DEATH THING ?

40:55.960 --> 40:59.589
I THINK PEOPLE LIVE ON
THROUGH THE PEOPLE THEY LOVE

40:59.600 --> 41:03.092
AND THE THINGS
THEY DO WITH THEIR LIVES.

41:03.100 --> 41:07.093
IF THEY MANAGE TO DO THINGS
WITH THEIR LIVES.

41:07.100 --> 41:10.592
BUT THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT,
THAT'S ALL THERE IS.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.818
THERE'S NOTHING MORE,
THERE'S NOTHING, LIKE, BIGGER ?

41:12.830 --> 41:14.195
JUST ENERGY.

41:14.200 --> 41:15.622
BUT THERE'S NO PLAN.

41:15.630 --> 41:18.451
NO, THERE'S
DEFINITELY NO PLAN.

41:21.100 --> 41:23.751
JUST SURVIVAL.

41:26.130 --> 41:28.155
SHOULD I HAVE
ORDERED THE SALMON ?

41:28.160 --> 41:30.856
UH, I DON'T KNOW.

41:33.330 --> 41:34.524
HOW CAN YOU
LIVE LIKE THAT ?

41:34.530 --> 41:37.124
WHAT IF YOU FOUND OUT
YOU WERE GONNA DIE TOMORROW ?

41:37.130 --> 41:38.791
I'VE BEEN PREPARED
TO DIE TOMORROW

41:38.800 --> 41:40.324
SINCE I WAS
SIX YEARS OLD.

41:40.330 --> 41:42.594
REALLY ?

41:42.600 --> 41:43.919
YEAH.

41:43.930 --> 41:46.421
PRETTY MUCH,
WE NEVER GOT BUTTER.

41:46.430 --> 41:48.125
WELL, WHY SINCE
YOU WERE SIX ?

41:48.130 --> 41:51.622
'CAUSE I READ A REPORT
ON THE EFFECT NUCLEAR WAR

41:51.630 --> 41:52.995
WOULD HAVE
ON THE WORLD.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.524
AND IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR TO ME,
AT THAT POINT,

41:54.530 --> 41:56.225
THAT THIS WAS DEFINITELY
GONNA HAPPEN.

41:56.230 --> 41:58.494
WHEN YOU WERE SIX ?

41:58.500 --> 42:02.527
AND I WAKE UP EVERY DAY
PRETTY MUCH SURPRISED THAT...

42:02.530 --> 42:06.091
EVERYTHING'S
STILL HERE.

42:06.100 --> 42:08.694
WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU CAN LIVE LIKE THAT.

42:08.700 --> 42:12.693
WELL, I THOUGHT
WE ALL DID.

42:27.400 --> 42:28.822
WHO IS THAT ?

42:28.830 --> 42:30.320
I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL
WITH HIM.

42:30.330 --> 42:33.356
HE'S CLEARLY
HAD A NOSE JOB.

42:36.930 --> 42:38.397
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

42:38.400 --> 42:40.220
GO ON.

42:40.230 --> 42:43.449
AND IMAGINE THAT
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM

42:43.460 --> 42:45.519
THINKS YOU ARE
AN IDIOT.

42:45.530 --> 42:48.328
A TOTAL FOOL,
A COMPLETE MORON,
ABSOLUTE ASS.

42:50.160 --> 42:52.549
FEEL FAMILIAR ?

42:52.560 --> 42:54.721
IT'S HOW YOU FEEL
IN THE WORLD, ISN'T IT ?

42:54.730 --> 42:57.392
I WANT YOU TO
FEEL IT DEEPLY NOW.

42:57.400 --> 42:58.594
REALLY FEEL IT.

42:58.600 --> 43:00.522
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM
THINKS YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

43:08.560 --> 43:10.152
CLOSE YOUR EYES, RUTH.

43:10.160 --> 43:12.492
FEEL YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

43:16.400 --> 43:18.152
NOW, TELL ME

43:18.160 --> 43:20.424
WHEN YOU GET THE JOKE.

43:23.600 --> 43:25.818
( laughing )

43:31.800 --> 43:33.153
DO YOU GET
THE JOKE, RUTH ?

43:33.160 --> 43:34.297
NO!

43:34.300 --> 43:35.699
I'M AN IDIOT !

43:35.700 --> 43:39.022
WHO WANTS TO EXPLAIN
THE JOKE TO RUTH ?

43:43.060 --> 43:45.597
SO, WE ALL FEEL
THE SAME WAY, RIGHT ?

43:45.600 --> 43:48.626
SO, WHO'S REALLY
THE ASSHOLE ?

43:48.630 --> 43:50.359
WE ALL ARE ?

43:50.360 --> 43:51.759
RUTH.

43:51.760 --> 43:53.091
STAND UP.

43:55.530 --> 43:58.454
TELL ME WHAT YOU WROTE IN YOUR
PRIVATE LETTER TO YOURSELF.

43:58.460 --> 44:00.894
IT WAS
A PRIVATE LETTER !

44:00.900 --> 44:02.299
TO MYSELF !

44:02.300 --> 44:05.019
TELL ME WHERE
YOUR HOUSE NEEDS REPAIRS !

44:05.030 --> 44:07.157
YEAH, AND DON'T BULLSHIT
THE LADY, CUPCAKE.

44:07.160 --> 44:10.618
I HAVE A VERY
NICE HOUSE !

44:10.630 --> 44:13.497
I HAVE NICE CHILDREN
AND A NICE JOB.

44:13.500 --> 44:16.060
AND A NICE
GENTLEMAN FRIEND.

44:16.060 --> 44:18.255
CAN'T ANYONE
JUST BE HAPPY ?

44:18.260 --> 44:20.592
I'M HAPPY.

44:20.600 --> 44:22.727
WHO'S BUYING
RUTH'S HOUSE ?

44:24.700 --> 44:27.260
WE DON'T BELIEVE YOUR HOUSE
IS STRUCTURALLY SOUND, RUTH.

44:27.260 --> 44:28.488
WHO KNOWS BETTER ?

44:28.500 --> 44:30.525

48:14.960 --> 48:16.393
I DIDN'T HIT HIM,
ALRIGHT ?

48:16.400 --> 48:17.992
HOW DO YOU KNOW,
I MEAN, ARE YOU SURE ?

48:18.000 --> 48:20.321
I SAW, HE'S FINE,

49:22.560 --> 49:24.528
THAN KS.

49:35.260 --> 49:37.091
OH, MY GOD.

50:20.860 --> 50:23.499
SO, WHERE DO YOU
THINK I AM, HMM ?

50:24.600 --> 50:26.397
HEAVEN OR HELL ?

50:26.400 --> 50:29.392
APPARENTLY, YOU'RE HERE,
AT THE MOMENT.

50:29.400 --> 50:31.857
YOU THINK I'M IN HELL.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.525
YEAH, SURE, I WENT TO CHURCH,
THAT WAS JUST FOR BUSINESS.

50:35.530 --> 50:37.259
I DIDN'T REALLY
BELIEVE IN GOD.

50:37.260 --> 50:40.024
I MEAN, NOT AS ANYONE
WHO YOU HAD TO PLEASE,

50:40.030 --> 50:41.622
OR IMPRESS,
TO GET "PROMOTED".

50:41.630 --> 50:46.124
NO, THE ONLY GOD I KNOW
IS A MEAN-SPIRITED COMEDIAN

50:46.130 --> 50:48.348
IN UGLY PANTS,

50:48.360 --> 50:51.227
WHOSE EVERY JOKE
HAS THE SAME DAMN PUNCH LINE.

50:51.230 --> 50:53.255
AND I'M THINKING
THAT KINDA ATTITUDE

50:53.260 --> 50:55.148
LANDS ME
STRAIGHT IN HELL.

50:55.160 --> 50:57.720
( laughing )

50:57.730 --> 50:59.425
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

50:59.430 --> 51:01.591
THAT MEANS...

51:01.600 --> 51:05.457
YOU'LL HAVE A FAMILIAR FACE
WAITING FOR YOU.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.998
HEY, LOOK IT UP.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.595
LEVITICUS,
CHAPTER 20, VERSE 13.

51:13.600 --> 51:16.319
I DON'T BELIEVE
THAT ANYMORE.

51:29.200 --> 51:31.498
AND I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE IN HELL.

51:32.930 --> 51:35.421
BUT YOU CAN'T QUITE SEE ME
HANGING AROUND WITH GANDHI

51:35.430 --> 51:37.227
AND MOTHER TERESA
UP THERE ?

51:39.560 --> 51:41.994
I MISS YOU, DAD.

51:45.360 --> 51:46.827
( Nate )
HEY.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.049
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
AT BRENDA'S.

51:50.060 --> 51:52.620

51:52.630 --> 51:54.359
SO, I THOUGHT I'D,

51:54.360 --> 51:56.726
HELP YOU CLEAN UP.

51:56.730 --> 51:57.924
THAN KS.

51:57.930 --> 52:00.524
AT THIS HOUR,
THAT IS A LATE CLIENT.

52:00.530 --> 52:03.499
SOME OF THEM LIKE HER
TO PUT THEM TO BED, YOU KNOW ?

52:03.500 --> 52:06.492
THAT'S VERY SAD.

52:06.500 --> 52:09.151
HEY, HOW LONG DID YOU
GO OUT WITH THAT COP ?

52:09.160 --> 52:11.628
ABOUT SIX MONTHS.

52:13.200 --> 52:15.122
SEX EVER SLOW DOWN ?

52:15.130 --> 52:17.758
I WAS SO HOPING YOU WEREN'T
GONNA GO THERE.

52:17.760 --> 52:20.524
( door opening and closing )
SORRY, FORGET IT.

52:22.260 --> 52:23.352
CLAIRE ?

52:23.360 --> 52:24.896
DAVID, I NEED SOME HELP.

52:24.900 --> 52:26.128
WHAT HAPPENED ?

52:26.130 --> 52:28.394
( sobbing )

52:32.030 --> 52:33.588
"FUCK MY LEGLESS
GRANDMOTHER !

52:33.600 --> 52:34.726
"AND FUCK YOU, ROBBIE,

52:34.730 --> 52:36.857
FOR NOT LETTING ME
HAVE A SNICKERS BAR !"

52:36.860 --> 52:38.521
OH, MY GOODNESS,
THE LANGUAGE !

52:38.530 --> 52:40.828
( laughing )

52:43.160 --> 52:44.923
I WAS SO RUDE.

52:44.930 --> 52:46.818
IT WAS FANTASTIC.

52:46.830 --> 52:48.627
QUELL BREAKTHROUGH.

52:48.630 --> 52:51.554
OH, ROBBIE, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU.

52:51.560 --> 52:53.755
DON'T THANK ME.

52:55.260 --> 52:57.194
JUST CHANGE !

52:58.500 --> 53:00.559
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO TOMORROW

53:00.560 --> 53:02.755
TO START THE RENOVATIONS ?

53:02.760 --> 53:04.921
THAT'S NONE OF
YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS !

53:04.930 --> 53:07.922
( laughing )

53:17.630 --> 53:19.097
HI.

53:27.530 --> 53:29.794
ANY IDEA
WHERE HE'D GO ?

53:33.160 --> 53:35.196
WHAT WAS HE WEARING ?

53:39.530 --> 53:42.124
YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA
BE MUCH EASIER ON HIM

53:42.130 --> 53:44.496
IF WE CAN BRING HIM IN
BEFORE SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS.

53:44.500 --> 53:47.151
BUT HE DOESN'T
EVEN HAVE THE GUN...

53:47.160 --> 53:49.594
WHAT, YOU THINK HE CAN'T
GET ANOTHER GUN ?

53:52.400 --> 53:53.492
UM...

53:55.930 --> 53:59.149
HE WAS WEARING JEANS
AND A GREEN T-SHIRT, I THINK.

54:00.630 --> 54:02.222
YOU'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

54:02.230 --> 54:04.391
YOU KNOW THAT,
RIGHT ?

54:06.560 --> 54:08.198
I FEEL LIKE SHIT.

54:08.200 --> 54:11.124
YOU'LL FEEL WORSE
IF SOMEONE ELSE GETS HURT.

54:12.830 --> 54:14.252
OH, MY GOD.

54:14.260 --> 54:17.923
WHEN THAT COP ASKED ME IF
I KNEW ABOUT THE 7-11 THING,

54:17.930 --> 54:19.397
I SAID I DIDN'T,
BUT I DID.

54:19.400 --> 54:22.096
IS THAT, LIKE,
REALLY BAD ?

54:22.100 --> 54:23.226
IT'S NOT GREAT.

54:23.230 --> 54:24.720
BUT YOU'RE TELLING
THE TRUTH NOW, RIGHT ?

54:24.730 --> 54:26.152
SO, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT.

54:26.160 --> 54:28.628
YOU WOULDN'T MAKE ME,
LIKE, TESTIFY AGAINST HIM

54:28.630 --> 54:30.120
OR SOMETHING, RIGHT ?

54:30.130 --> 54:31.427
THAT'S NOT UP TO ME.

54:31.430 --> 54:33.591
BUT, ANYWAY,
THAT'S A LONG WAYS OFF.

54:33.600 --> 54:37.058
OKAY, 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

54:37.060 --> 54:39.449
GOD, WHY ARE YOU STILL
PROTECTING THIS LOSER ?

54:39.460 --> 54:41.257
BECAUSE SHE LOVES HIM.

54:44.860 --> 54:46.657
WE UNDERSTAND THAT,
CLAIRE.

54:46.660 --> 54:50.824
( David )
I REALLY WISH YOU'D TOLD us
ABOUT THIS SOON ER.

54:50.830 --> 54:52.821
HOW LONG DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE EMBALMING FLUID ?

54:52.830 --> 54:54.297
NOT THAT LONG.

54:54.300 --> 54:56.097
AND I TRIED
TO TELL NATE.

54:56.100 --> 54:58.398
WHEN, WHEN THE FUCK DID YOU
TRY AND TELL ME ABOUT THIS ?

54:58.400 --> 55:00.823
SHE'S TELLING YOU NOW,
ALRIGHT ?

55:01.130 --> 55:02.791
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

55:06.700 --> 55:08.452
I'M SORRY.

55:09.400 --> 55:10.992
WHEN YOU'RE READY,

55:11.000 --> 55:13.195
WE'RE GONNA GET IN THE CAR
AND DRIVE DOWN TO THE STATION,

55:13.200 --> 55:16.829
AND A COUPLE OF DETECT IVES
THERE ARE GONNA ASK YOU

55:16.830 --> 55:18.388
PRETTY MUCH
THE SAME QUESTIONS.

55:18.400 --> 55:21.096
WILL YOU BE THERE ?

55:21.100 --> 55:22.158
YES.

55:22.160 --> 55:23.889
I'LL BE THERE.
