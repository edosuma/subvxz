[coughing]

01:11.321 --> 01:13.239
[coughing continues]

01:13.323 --> 01:16.576
Something in the air doesn't
agree with my garden, Maxie.

01:16.659 --> 01:18.578
That's pollution, Pop.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.373
Now, son, it's OK to disagree with me,

01:21.456 --> 01:23.750
but no need to use that sort of language.

01:23.833 --> 01:26.961
Dad! I'm talking about
all the dirt in the air,

01:27.045 --> 01:31.383
and it's coming from there,
that new Slimeco factory.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.134
You're right, Maxie.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.720
The air was lots cleaner
before they showed up.

01:35.804 --> 01:39.724
I want to show you something. Volare!

01:39.808 --> 01:41.810
This is what you wanted to show me?

01:41.893 --> 01:43.561
An empty mayonnaise jar?

01:43.645 --> 01:45.563
It's clean air, Max.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.732
Been saving it since my childhood.

01:47.816 --> 01:51.903
Wow! It's 10 times cleaner
than the air outside.

01:51.986 --> 01:53.321
That settles it.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.490
I'm going to go talk
to them Slimeco fellers

01:55.573 --> 01:57.325
about cleaning up their act.

01:57.409 --> 01:59.536
Here, son, you keep this.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.579
It's a family air-loom.

02:04.332 --> 02:07.252
Ah! Mr. Goof! So nice of you to drop by!

02:07.335 --> 02:08.962
I'm Fenton Sludge, owner of Slimeco,

02:09.045 --> 02:11.464
and this is my assistant
for 12 years, Milton.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.717
Melvin, sir. The name's Melvin.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.969
Always a pleasure to meet
a member of the community

02:16.052 --> 02:18.763
we destroy-- I mean serve.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.724
Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Sludge.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.934
Now, about my petunias--

02:23.018 --> 02:26.229
Come, come. Let me show you
around our modest little factory.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.941
Like I was saying,
my petunias are getting all wilty,

02:30.025 --> 02:31.609
and some of them are about to--

02:31.693 --> 02:37.699
Ah! I love the smell
of toxic waste in the morning.

02:37.782 --> 02:40.452
It smells like... money.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.455
Mr. Sludge, you've gotta stop pollutin'.

02:43.538 --> 02:46.958
-[gulps]
-I've got to what?

02:47.042 --> 02:48.501
S-stop pollutin'.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.504
You're dirtyin' up the air and water, too.

02:51.588 --> 02:56.509
Oh, am I? Do you have any idea
what clean air and water would cost me?

02:56.593 --> 02:58.261
Quick. What would it cost me?

03:00.013 --> 03:01.389
Three cents a day.

03:01.473 --> 03:04.142
Three cents a day?
There goes my profit margin!

03:04.225 --> 03:08.063
Are you trying to ruin me, Mr. Goof?
To destroy me?

03:08.146 --> 03:09.522
Why, I ought to--

03:09.606 --> 03:11.441
Tell you what.

03:11.524 --> 03:14.736
I'll bring it up
at the next board meeting.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.738
And just so you don't go home
empty-handed,

03:16.821 --> 03:19.074
A couple Slimeco souvenirs.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.119
Whaa-hoo-hoo!

03:24.412 --> 03:25.413
[splat]

03:25.497 --> 03:27.874
And thanks for dropping in!

03:27.957 --> 03:30.043
[laughing]

03:30.460 --> 03:34.839
And overall, Mr. Sludge seemed
like a real nice feller, Maxie.

03:34.923 --> 03:38.343
Dad, don't you get it?
He gave you the brush-off.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.095
Don't think so, Maxie.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.055
Just this pennant and cap.

03:42.138 --> 03:45.350
No, Dad. We've been studying
politics in school.

03:45.433 --> 03:46.893
And I know what's going on here.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.937
-You do?
-Yeah.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.314
Mr. Sludge figures he doesn't
have to listen to you

03:51.398 --> 03:53.566
because you're just John Q. Public.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.569
You mean the feller they named
the public library after?

03:57.862 --> 03:59.114
I got it!

03:59.197 --> 04:02.909
Our teacher's been telling us there's
a special election for mayor coming up.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.161
Dad, you've gotta get involved.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.247
OK, Maxie, I will!

04:07.330 --> 04:08.748
And take a stand!

04:08.832 --> 04:10.875
I'm standin', son.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.086
Dad, you've gotta run!

04:13.169 --> 04:15.880
I'm runnin', Maxie!

04:15.964 --> 04:17.215
[crash]

04:17.298 --> 04:19.050
Just one question, son.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.636
Where am I running to?

04:22.887 --> 04:24.431
City Hall, Dad!

04:24.514 --> 04:27.600
You're gonna be the new mayor
of Spoonerville.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.020
-I am?
-it's the only way

04:30.103 --> 04:32.605
you'll ever get Slimeco to stop polluting.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.983
But Maxie, I'm no politician.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.901
Nothin' to worry about, Pop.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.320
This book will tell ya
everything ya need to know.

04:39.404 --> 04:43.825
[narrator clears throat]
"How To Be A Politician."

04:43.908 --> 04:46.161
Ah, the politician.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.912
Staunch advocate of the common good.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.664
Tireless public servant.

04:49.748 --> 04:52.959
Selflessly fighting for
the welfare of his fellow man.

04:53.043 --> 04:56.504
What qualifies him for
this most elevated of posts?

04:56.588 --> 04:58.256
His formidable experience?

04:58.340 --> 04:59.632
Keen intelligence?

04:59.716 --> 05:01.426
Unassailable honesty?

05:01.509 --> 05:03.011
Yes!

05:03.094 --> 05:05.221
Plus, he got the most votes.

05:05.263 --> 05:08.808
Chapter one-- How to get elected.

05:08.892 --> 05:12.687
The single greatest vote-getting device
is the handshake.

05:13.021 --> 05:16.232
Be ever diligent to shake every hand
that comes your way.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.526
Remember, an unshook hand

05:18.610 --> 05:20.362
is a vote for your opponent.

05:21.279 --> 05:24.240
Hi. How ya doin'?
Hope ya vote for me. Ah-hyuck!

05:24.324 --> 05:27.577
Hi. Hello. How ya doin'?
Hope you vote for me.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.413
[narrator]
Unfortunately for most candidates,

05:30.497 --> 05:33.416
the right hand seldom knows
what the left is doing.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.670
Chapter two-- Kissing babies.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.798
There is no better way to win the vote
of a proud new parent,

05:39.881 --> 05:42.008
than to admire and kiss their baby.

05:42.092 --> 05:45.345
Cute baby. Ah-hyuck!

05:45.428 --> 05:49.641
[narrator] Though nine out of ten babies
are precious bundles of joy...

05:49.724 --> 05:50.725
Adorable.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.730
[narrator] It's the 10th one
you have to watch out for.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.816
Well, aren't you going to kiss him?

06:00.902 --> 06:03.238
Gawrsh! The political arena's

06:03.321 --> 06:05.699
a lot like the boxing arena.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.410
[narrator] Chapter three.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.829
Having mastered the art of handshaking

06:10.912 --> 06:11.913
and baby kissing,

06:11.996 --> 06:14.165
It's time to combine the two.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.333
Shake.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.793
Kiss.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.044
[narrator] Have you got it?

06:18.128 --> 06:20.213
I think so. Shake.

06:20.296 --> 06:21.965
Kiss.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.550
Why, you--

06:23.633 --> 06:25.969
[narrator]
Yes, by following these few simple tips,

06:26.052 --> 06:28.138
your campaign will really take off.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.265
-[bell dings]
-whaa-hoo-hoo-hoo!

06:48.616 --> 06:50.035
Hey, Goofster!

06:50.535 --> 06:52.871
Be right with you, Petey. I'm studying.

06:54.622 --> 06:57.417
You? Studying? [laughing]

06:57.500 --> 06:59.169
Lemme see that!

06:59.252 --> 07:01.755
"How To Be A Politician."

07:01.838 --> 07:04.090
Thinking of runnin' for dogcatcher?

07:04.174 --> 07:05.592
[laughing]

07:05.675 --> 07:08.428
No, Petey. I'm running for mayor.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.847
A Goof as mayor?

07:12.682 --> 07:14.225
That's rich!

07:14.309 --> 07:16.895
Yup, and I'd appreciate your vote.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.230
Hey, what is this, aerobics?

07:19.314 --> 07:21.066
Let go of me, ya Goof!

07:21.149 --> 07:22.484
OK, Petey.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.777
[crash]

07:28.740 --> 07:31.659
Say, I bet if I was mayor,

07:31.743 --> 07:33.828
I could take long vacations

07:33.912 --> 07:36.122
and ride in big limozeenies.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.086
Hear ye! Hear ye!

07:41.169 --> 07:44.422
Presentin' his honor, the mayor...

07:44.506 --> 07:45.382
Pete!

07:45.632 --> 07:48.343
-[cheering]
-[slurping]

07:49.678 --> 07:52.639
Pete? Oh, Petey? You OK?

07:52.722 --> 07:54.140
Ya look a little flushed.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.976
Uh, listen, Goof.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.145
You don't want to be a mayor.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.981
-It's a job for suckers.
-It is?

08:02.065 --> 08:04.401
Sure! Everybody screaming--

08:04.484 --> 08:07.070
"Fix the potholes! Lower the taxes!

08:07.153 --> 08:08.655
Build a highway!"

08:08.738 --> 08:11.241
Ha! Who needs that kind of aggravation?

08:11.324 --> 08:14.661
But, Petey, I'm running to stop
Slimeco from pollutin'.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.414
And everybody I've talked to
says they're gonna vote for me.

08:17.497 --> 08:21.084
Hmm. Anti-pollution, eh?

08:21.167 --> 08:22.836
Not a bad angle.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.214
[Peg] You?
You running for mayor, Pete-ums?

08:26.297 --> 08:28.925
[laughs] You can't be serious.

08:29.009 --> 08:32.512
Never been more serious
in my life, pound cake.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.140
You're up to something, aren't you?

08:35.223 --> 08:38.560
Oh, you got me all wrong, angel feet.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.604
The reason I'm runnin' is 'cause I...

08:41.688 --> 08:43.815
To stop pollution! That's it!

08:43.898 --> 08:45.400
Ooh, I hate that stuff.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.569
Oh, since when? Only last week,

08:47.652 --> 08:50.739
you were taking smog devices
off the RVs you sell.

08:50.822 --> 08:54.367
Yeah, Daddy. And Mommy's always
yelling at you for littering.

08:54.451 --> 08:57.620
And you're always telling me
how recycling is for suckers.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.707
Yeah, well, see, that was the old Pete.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.043
This is the new Pete--

09:03.126 --> 09:05.253
No Pollution Pete.

09:05.337 --> 09:08.423
Well, I have just one thing to say.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.592
What's that, poodle-kins?

09:10.675 --> 09:14.387
I'm very proud of you!

09:14.512 --> 09:16.806
Me, too. Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

09:17.682 --> 09:21.603
And if elected,
I promise to clean up Slimeco

09:21.686 --> 09:23.229
and stop pollution!

09:23.313 --> 09:25.774
So remember-- a vote for me

09:25.857 --> 09:29.402
is the Goofy way to vote. Ah-hyuck!

09:30.987 --> 09:31.988
[cheering, applause]

09:32.072 --> 09:33.990
That was candidate Goof

09:34.074 --> 09:36.451
giving his anti-pollution speech.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.161
Later, across town,

09:38.244 --> 09:41.081
Candidate Pete gave his
anti-pollution speech.

09:41.164 --> 09:44.167
And if elected, I promise to...

09:44.250 --> 09:47.962
Uh... clean up slim mec--uh--

09:48.046 --> 09:51.049
Slimeco and stop pollution!

09:51.132 --> 09:53.051
So remember-- a vote for me

09:53.134 --> 09:55.303
is the Goofy-- [chuckles]

09:55.387 --> 09:57.931
I mean, the Petey way to vote!

09:58.014 --> 10:00.141
[cheering, applause]

10:02.560 --> 10:04.854
Two do-gooder candidates?

10:04.938 --> 10:07.023
What's this world coming to?

10:07.107 --> 10:10.860
I simply must get one of them
in my control.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.529
Good thinking, sir.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.281
Bribery has always been
one of your strong suits.

10:15.365 --> 10:19.035
Hmm. That Goof character is too honest.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.705
-What do we know about the other one?
-Oh!

10:21.788 --> 10:24.541
Well, sir, I bought a car
from him last week.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.252
It had no smog device,
and it fell apart day later.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.170
Sounds promising.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.006
Call up his permanent record.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.758
[beeping]

10:33.842 --> 10:36.011
I think we hit the jackpot, sir.

10:36.094 --> 10:39.639
Lies, cheats, turns back odometers,

10:39.723 --> 10:42.267
and overall, has the morals
of a pickpocket.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.811
Do you think he's bribable, Marvin?

10:44.894 --> 10:47.564
Oh, infinitely bribable, sir.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.315
And the name's Melvin.

10:49.399 --> 10:54.237
Well, Morton, it looks like we've found
the next mayor of Spoonerville.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.781
[laughing]

10:59.492 --> 11:03.705
This is some kind of operation
you got, Mr. Sludge.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.374
Please, please, call me Fenton.

11:06.458 --> 11:11.254
And what is it exactly that
you make here, uh, Fenton?

11:12.130 --> 11:13.715
Money, Pete!

11:13.798 --> 11:16.092
Lots and lots of money!

11:16.176 --> 11:19.054
Which brings me to the reason
I invited you here today.

11:19.137 --> 11:23.183
You see, Pete, I'm thinking of donating
to your campaign fund.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.395
Oooh!

11:27.479 --> 11:32.567
But I know how strongly
anti-pollution you are.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.653
Yeah, well, uh...

11:35.737 --> 11:37.489
There's two sides to every issue.

11:37.572 --> 11:41.409
And I certainly wouldn't want
to compromise your morals.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.119
Morals, shmorals.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.747
I'm always open to another point of view.

11:45.830 --> 11:49.542
If there were only some way
to get you to change your mind.

11:49.626 --> 11:54.214
Oh, I feel it changing already, Fenton.

11:54.297 --> 11:55.882
Uh, you missed a pocket.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.634
Help yourself.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.513
So, do we understand each other?

12:01.596 --> 12:03.139
I back you for mayor,

12:03.223 --> 12:04.849
and when you get into office...

12:04.933 --> 12:07.143
Right. Sure.

12:07.227 --> 12:10.355
I make sure Slimeco
stays in business forever!

12:10.438 --> 12:11.648
Precisely.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.525
Oh, and Pete...

12:13.608 --> 12:15.902
You will stop saying
all those nasty things

12:15.985 --> 12:17.946
about pollution, won't you?

12:18.029 --> 12:19.531
Eh, pollution?

12:19.614 --> 12:20.865
What's that, Fenton?

12:20.949 --> 12:24.285
[laughing] You can count on me, pal.

12:24.369 --> 12:25.912
[laughing]

12:27.622 --> 12:31.167
And we gotta stop Slimeco
from dumping stuff in this lake,

12:31.251 --> 12:35.588
so Maxie and his friends
will can a nice clean place to swim.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.799
[crowd cheering]

12:37.882 --> 12:40.301
So if you want to stop pollution,

12:40.385 --> 12:43.972
vote for me... Or for my pal Petey.

12:44.055 --> 12:46.766
My fellow Spoonervillians,

12:46.850 --> 12:50.061
the Goof here is a big dumb liar!

12:50.145 --> 12:52.272
There's nothing wrong with this lake.

12:52.355 --> 12:55.025
Allow me to demonstrate.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.110
Uh, what's Dad up to, Mom?

12:57.193 --> 12:59.195
I haven't the foggiest,

12:59.279 --> 13:01.614
but you can be sure he's up to something.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.286

13:06.369 --> 13:08.997

13:18.590 --> 13:21.092

that package of old meat

13:21.176 --> 13:23.511

13:32.228 --> 13:34.814

13:37.359 --> 13:39.277
Hey, that's not Goofy.

13:39.361 --> 13:41.821
-That's Pete!
-Where's Goofy?

13:41.905 --> 13:44.032
Shameful, isn't it?

13:44.115 --> 13:47.535
The Goof doesn't even show up
for his own parade.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.121
Won't give you people the time of day.

13:50.205 --> 13:51.539
But I will!

13:51.623 --> 13:54.209
Free watches for everybody!

13:57.629 --> 13:59.506
Hey, kids, what time is it?

13:59.589 --> 14:03.301
It's time to vote for Pete!

14:03.385 --> 14:05.720
[laughing]

14:06.221 --> 14:09.557
A vote for me is the Goofy way to vote!

14:09.641 --> 14:12.894
A vote for me is the Goofy way to vote!

14:12.977 --> 14:16.731
Pop? Are you sure
this is the parade route?

14:16.815 --> 14:18.733
Sure, I'm sure, Maxie.

14:18.817 --> 14:22.696
Petey wrote out these directions for me
so I wouldn't get lost.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.116
[mooing]

14:26.199 --> 14:31.496
"Goofy wins the rural vote!
Scores big in Spoonerville heartland!"

14:31.579 --> 14:36.292
You're proving to be
a great disappointment to me, Pete!

14:36.376 --> 14:41.256
But how was I supposed to know
those cows were registered voters?

14:41.339 --> 14:45.051
Don't worry. I'll cream that Goof in
the debate tomorrow night.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.302
You'd better!

14:46.386 --> 14:47.971
Well, ciao.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.222
Arrivederci.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.807
Toodles.

14:51.266 --> 14:52.350
Monroe!

14:52.434 --> 14:55.186
Right here, sir, and it's Melvin, sir.

14:55.270 --> 14:58.440
That knucklehead Pete can't be trusted
to defeat Goofy.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.316
Oh, sir, I know that look.

15:00.442 --> 15:02.694
You've got an evil plan, don't you?

15:02.777 --> 15:04.863
Yes, Maureen, I do.

15:04.946 --> 15:09.200
Load ten barrels of this toxic ooze
into the back my limousine.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.619
I'm going to make a little delivery.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.663
[laughing]

15:13.747 --> 15:17.751
Good evening, everyone.
This is Dan Blather with all the news

15:17.834 --> 15:20.128
coming to you live from Pete's RV lot,

15:20.211 --> 15:21.755
the site of tonight's debate.

15:21.838 --> 15:24.591
We asked each debater to draw straws.

15:26.217 --> 15:28.303
And it looks like Pete's drawn
the longest one,

15:28.386 --> 15:30.889
so our first question goes to him.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.433
Pete, taking into account
municipal revenues

15:33.558 --> 15:38.021
and recessionary deflation,
what fiduciary index would you use

15:38.104 --> 15:39.689
to determine taxes?

15:39.773 --> 15:41.900
I-- I, uh, well...

15:42.776 --> 15:44.736
Free burgers for everyone!

15:44.819 --> 15:46.529
-[crowd clamoring]
-Oh, burgers! All right!

15:46.613 --> 15:48.323
[laughing]

15:48.448 --> 15:52.077
I see. And what is your response,
candidate Goofy?

15:52.160 --> 15:54.329
Ah-hyuck! Needs ketchup.

15:54.412 --> 15:57.540
Candidate Pete,
how can you possibly justify

15:57.624 --> 15:59.501
your current position on pollution?

15:59.584 --> 16:02.337
Are you actually in favor
of dirty air and water?

16:02.420 --> 16:04.506
[crowd clamoring]

16:04.589 --> 16:06.591
Well... well... I...

16:06.883 --> 16:10.136
[sputtering] See, Dan, the thing is...

16:10.220 --> 16:13.306
Let me answer that like this.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.433
When I was young lad,

16:15.517 --> 16:17.894
I had a puppy named Chester.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.689
He had a warm, wet nose

16:20.772 --> 16:22.941
and a fluffy tail.

16:23.024 --> 16:26.236
He was given to me
by my Mom on my mother's side.

16:26.319 --> 16:29.614
Oh, that woman... [sniff]...
She was a saint.

16:29.698 --> 16:31.574
She worked two jobs,

16:31.658 --> 16:34.411
then came home to clean and cook for us,

16:34.494 --> 16:37.789
never spoke a disparagin' word.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.000
What's Daddy talking about, Mommy?

16:40.083 --> 16:43.378
Yeah, I thought they asked him
a question about pollution.

16:43.712 --> 16:47.716
Children, your father's demonstrating
pollution of the mouth.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.510
[shaking] And then one day,

16:50.593 --> 16:55.598
Chester wasn't there
when I came home from school.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.518
And my mother said, "Son,"
And I said, "Mom."

16:58.601 --> 16:59.894
We were close.

17:00.603 --> 17:03.690
"He's gone to that big kennel in the sky."

17:03.815 --> 17:06.943
[sobbing]

17:07.027 --> 17:08.445
I'm sorry, Petey!

17:08.528 --> 17:10.405
I never knew!

17:10.488 --> 17:12.991
You've got my vote. [sobbing]

17:13.074 --> 17:15.577
You're drippin' on me, ya Goof!

17:15.702 --> 17:17.787
-I made the whole thing up!
-[crowd clamoring]

17:17.871 --> 17:19.622
Hey, no! No!

17:19.706 --> 17:21.666
What I meant was...

17:21.833 --> 17:25.420
Here. Take a look at these.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.464
[gasp] Oh, my!

17:27.589 --> 17:30.008
It's a scoop! I've got a scoop!

17:30.091 --> 17:32.594
Candidates, what would you say about this?

17:32.677 --> 17:36.806
Ten barrels of toxic waste being
stored in a residential garage!

17:36.931 --> 17:40.310
Mmm.
I'd say that looks a lot like my garage.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.146
In fact, it is my garage!

17:44.230 --> 17:45.607
Gawrsh.

17:47.484 --> 17:50.320
Scandal rocks the Spoonerville elections,

17:50.403 --> 17:52.113
as anti-pollution candidate Goofy

17:52.238 --> 17:55.200
is exposed as the traitor he is.

17:55.283 --> 17:59.454
Gawrsh, Maxie, they're calling me
an eggs benedict.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.873
That's Benedict Arnold, Dad.

18:01.956 --> 18:04.668
Although the election
isn't until tomorrow,

18:04.751 --> 18:08.129
Pete has already
declared himself the winner.

18:08.213 --> 18:11.716
I just don't remember putting those things
in there, Maxie.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.134
Dad, you didn't.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.136
It's obvious you were set up!

18:15.220 --> 18:17.681
I was? But by who?

18:18.765 --> 18:21.101
Thank you all for coming.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.436
Please quiet down.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.272
Not my Petey!

18:26.898 --> 18:28.274
Looks that way, Pop.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.277
No! Look that way, Maxie!

18:31.361 --> 18:35.073
These footprints
could only belong to one person.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.367
The swamp beast from Planet Nine?

18:37.450 --> 18:40.704
No, Maxie. The president of Slimeco!

18:41.579 --> 18:45.083
Come on, little feller, we're gonna have
a talk with Fenton Sludge.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.960
Wait a second, Dad!

18:47.043 --> 18:50.672
Show that Slimeco creep
what clean air really looks like.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.382
Will do, Maxie!

-Yeow!

19:16.322 --> 19:19.200
After all the vicious, nasty things

19:19.284 --> 19:21.411
you've said about Slimeco,

19:21.494 --> 19:23.913
you dare to show your face here?

19:23.997 --> 19:24.956
Are you mad?

19:25.081 --> 19:27.042
You bet I'm mad!

19:27.125 --> 19:29.127
You're the one who put
that smelly stuff in my garage,

19:29.210 --> 19:30.378
aren't you?

19:30.462 --> 19:32.964
Of course I am, you fool!

19:33.048 --> 19:34.215
I had to stop you.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.384
You were trying to have shut down!

19:36.468 --> 19:38.636
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Sludge,

19:38.720 --> 19:39.929
but I think you should see this.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.891
[Dan] ...where just minutes ago,

19:42.974 --> 19:44.809
a monster made of toxic waste

19:44.893 --> 19:47.771
busted free from
the garage candidate Goof.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.439
Refusing to be interviewed,

19:49.522 --> 19:52.108
It was last seen
heading down the highway--

19:52.192 --> 19:56.071
Fool! Didn't you realize
exposing those barrels to sunlight

19:56.154 --> 19:58.281
would cause them to mutate and come alive?

19:58.365 --> 20:00.950
In a word, not really.

20:01.034 --> 20:05.038
I've had quite enough of you, Mr. Goof!

a family resemblance, sir.

Mr. Ooze Monster.

agree with you much, does it?

What's in that bottle? I must know!

20:59.592 --> 21:01.344
It could be worth a fortune!

21:15.316 --> 21:16.651
No, you're not, Fenton.

21:16.735 --> 21:18.570
You're just letting off a little steam.

21:18.653 --> 21:19.654
Ah-hyuck!

Well, what do you know?

You're a handsome guy!

He's right, sir. That clean air
really cleared up your complexion.

21:27.996 --> 21:31.416
Merlin, from now on,
I'm going to devote my life

21:31.499 --> 21:34.461
to cleaning up pollution
instead of causing it.

21:34.544 --> 21:36.796
Bravo, Mr. Sludge! Bravo!

21:36.880 --> 21:38.840
-Just one thing.
