<i>Flight 530 from San Francisco,</i>

00:38.944 --> 00:41.304
<i>you're cleared for landing, Captain.</i>

00:46.945 --> 00:49.905
- Sorry, I don't speak Spanish.
- First time in Spain?

00:49.986 --> 00:52.586
Yeah, first time in Spain.
Where's my luggage?

00:53.626 --> 00:56.427
Unfortunately,
it's still in San Francisco.

00:56.547 --> 00:57.747
Fantastic.

00:58.988 --> 00:59.987
Sally, it's me.

01:00.109 --> 01:02.748
Can you call the airline and tell them
to leave my bags in San Francisco?

01:02.829 --> 01:05.869
I'll be back before they get here, anyway.
Thanks.

01:14.391 --> 01:15.470
Will?

01:31.075 --> 01:32.795
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:33.956 --> 01:36.035
I was... I was expecting Josh.

01:37.357 --> 01:39.834
He's asleep on the boat. Jet lag.

01:41.636 --> 01:43.956
- Hit him all of a sudden. Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

01:47.997 --> 01:49.676
How's the posting?

01:50.038 --> 01:51.357
Best in a while.

01:52.358 --> 01:55.358
Had a gospel quartet come through here
for about six weeks,

01:55.399 --> 01:58.318
and then a Picasso expert
from Oregon State.

01:58.919 --> 02:03.079
Why on earth would Spain want to hear
from a Picasso expert from Oregon?

02:03.360 --> 02:04.719
A different perspective.

02:04.801 --> 02:06.361
Sorry, hold on.

02:07.921 --> 02:09.080
Hello?

02:09.121 --> 02:11.962
Look, could I call you
back in a few hours?

02:13.484 --> 02:15.242
- Okay, bye. Bye.
- Bye.

02:22.644 --> 02:23.923
One call, Dad.

02:24.885 --> 02:29.205
This vacation, it's just a real bad time for me
to be away from the company.

02:29.246 --> 02:32.525
Your mother's pretty happy
about this vacation, Will.

02:37.367 --> 02:38.406
Will?

02:40.968 --> 02:42.808
Oh! Mmm!

02:42.888 --> 02:45.607
- You look great, Mom.
- Thanks for the groceries, hon.

02:45.731 --> 02:47.489
How come you're so relaxed?

02:47.529 --> 02:50.370
Well, that's 'cause
we're all finally here.

02:50.890 --> 02:52.089
How was your flight?

02:52.131 --> 02:55.011
The plane went up, flew straight across,
went down again.

02:55.172 --> 02:57.051
Nothing a small bathtub
of vino won't fix.

02:57.132 --> 03:00.171
We can do better than that.
Now, why don't you get that suit off?

03:00.212 --> 03:03.052
It looks like an accordion on you.
Where's your luggage?

03:03.093 --> 03:05.132
Apparently it's still saying goodbye
to the Golden Gate Bridge.

03:05.173 --> 03:07.373
Oh! For heaven's sake. Uh...

03:07.453 --> 03:09.814
Well, there's some clothes you left behind
from last year's trip.

03:09.894 --> 03:11.014
Why don't you put those on?

03:11.095 --> 03:13.415
I'll have a nice glass of Rioja waiting for you
when you're ready.

03:13.455 --> 03:14.735
See what I mean?

03:14.736 --> 03:16.696
When I got here, she was like,
"Beer's in the fridge."

03:16.856 --> 03:18.776
Mom always liked you best.

03:18.936 --> 03:20.175
Oh, God.

03:21.857 --> 03:23.377
Look who's here.

03:24.337 --> 03:26.697
Dara, this is Will. The good brother.

03:26.818 --> 03:29.137
The one who used to tell everybody
he was an only child.

03:29.178 --> 03:31.218
Only after Josh was born.

03:41.062 --> 03:42.700
How was the ride with Godzilla?

03:43.580 --> 03:45.780
No blood, no foul. Yeah.

03:45.860 --> 03:47.981
Well, just take it nice and easy.
It's only a week.

03:48.101 --> 03:50.101
I think your dad's a sweetie.

03:51.023 --> 03:53.142
She grew up in a Soviet orphanage.

03:55.824 --> 03:57.543
Well, I gotta get changed.

03:57.584 --> 03:59.863
That's not bad.

03:59.864 --> 04:02.944
But it's a government job.
You have to tolerate the bureaucracy.

04:03.104 --> 04:05.983
You move when the government
tells you to move, so not everybody likes it.

04:06.024 --> 04:07.384
Yeah, I'm not sure I liked it.

04:07.466 --> 04:09.304
Josh and I never got to have
the same friends

04:09.305 --> 04:10.785
for more than two years in a row.

04:10.826 --> 04:13.746
Not to mention we lived in
12 different countries over 18 years.

04:14.188 --> 04:16.586
But the best thing is we learned
about 15 weird local sports.

04:16.587 --> 04:17.867
Excuse me, my man.

04:17.947 --> 04:21.226
We both played basketball and ran track
in the Comoros, remember?

04:21.389 --> 04:23.509
Although no one in the school
was over 5'3",

04:23.549 --> 04:26.188
and Will was pretty much the all-star
everywhere we went.

04:28.150 --> 04:29.629
Wow! Well done.

04:30.751 --> 04:31.910
Mmm. Got it?

04:32.151 --> 04:34.431
Before we start,
I just want to say how happy I am

04:34.432 --> 04:36.350
that we're all finally together
around a table again.

04:36.951 --> 04:38.830
I didn't realize how much I'd missed this.

04:38.872 --> 04:40.352
- To family.
- Nice.

04:40.393 --> 04:41.552
To family.

04:44.233 --> 04:45.592
This looks fantastic.

04:45.714 --> 04:47.313
My caveman caught it this morning.

04:47.433 --> 04:49.033
You fish, Mr. Shaw?

04:49.155 --> 04:50.513
Yeah, he fishes.

04:50.595 --> 04:53.074
- Oh, guys.
- He fishes. He fishes.

04:53.195 --> 04:55.914
- No, guys, seriously, please.
- Come on! I want to hear this story.

04:57.036 --> 04:58.955
- Spear-fishing, actually, is his forte.
- Excuse me.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.195
I got to take this. Important.

05:00.196 --> 05:02.076
No more of those stories
or I'll start telling some of yours.

05:03.157 --> 05:05.717
Where are you sleeping tonight?
You guys aren't sleeping together, are you?

05:05.758 --> 05:06.757
Jesus, Dad.

05:07.878 --> 05:13.238
If we work together on this, I'm sure
it's going to be beneficial for both of us.

05:15.640 --> 05:17.198
This Thursday?

05:17.960 --> 05:20.359
I'm out of the country, so...

05:27.362 --> 05:29.281
I understand.

05:30.843 --> 05:32.443
Okay. Bye.

05:41.085 --> 05:43.725
- Quite dangerous.
- Yeah, in his case it was quite dangerous.

05:43.766 --> 05:45.925
- Here he comes. Shh!
- Poor Will.

05:46.086 --> 05:47.565
- Poor Will.
- It's just his little secret.

05:47.606 --> 05:49.325
That story's going to stay
in the family for a while.

05:49.366 --> 05:50.325
It's not going anywhere.

05:50.446 --> 05:52.406
Please, tell me. Come on.

05:53.367 --> 05:54.526
Josh, that's enough.

05:54.567 --> 05:57.405
- No, guys, seriously, please. Don't.
- Will is the fisherman.

05:57.448 --> 06:00.406
All right, before they go off
on any kind of fantastic story,

06:00.648 --> 06:02.527
what really happened
was that he took me out

06:02.528 --> 06:06.169
when I'm 10 years old spear-fishing,
ten years old,

06:07.009 --> 06:09.088
and I spear my own flipper.

06:09.490 --> 06:11.050
And everyone finds this hilarious.

06:11.090 --> 06:13.169
- That's the story?
- That's the story.

06:13.531 --> 06:15.050
He cried all night.

06:15.090 --> 06:17.371
- He could've speared his foot.
- He cried himself to sleep.

06:17.412 --> 06:20.251
Will would make this noise
when he cried. Josh could tell you.

06:20.291 --> 06:22.891
- It's like a little wuffling sound.
- Really funny. Really...

06:22.932 --> 06:25.173
Actually, you know what?
This is not the day for a joke.

06:30.615 --> 06:33.414
- I don't know if I can stay the week.
- What?

06:37.096 --> 06:38.295
I'm sorry, Mom.

06:38.416 --> 06:42.495
I have just found out

06:42.536 --> 06:44.217
my company is officially bankrupt.

06:51.298 --> 06:52.338
What?

06:54.059 --> 06:56.299
- I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?

06:57.820 --> 06:58.860
Will?

07:35.588 --> 07:38.067
I'm sorry I went off at you at dinner.

07:42.069 --> 07:45.348
I'm sorry you're going through
such a difficult time.

07:52.271 --> 07:53.589
Thank you.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.352
It'll be a good wind tomorrow.

08:05.033 --> 08:06.072
Yeah.

08:21.077 --> 08:22.676
Get ready to come about!

08:24.998 --> 08:26.236
Will?

08:26.838 --> 08:27.958
Will!

08:36.799 --> 08:38.520
Tighter on that boom!

08:39.481 --> 08:40.919
Tighter, Will!

08:41.001 --> 08:43.120
I heard you the first time.

08:57.123 --> 08:58.883
Josh, we'll anchor here!

09:15.248 --> 09:16.326
Will?

09:17.808 --> 09:18.848
Will!

09:21.249 --> 09:23.049
When you get a minute.

09:28.210 --> 09:29.971
Keep it into the wind.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.618
Will! lnto the wind!

10:17.459 --> 10:19.299
Head it into the wind!

10:22.901 --> 10:23.940
Dara!

10:26.422 --> 10:27.740
Oh, my God, are you okay?

10:27.782 --> 10:29.181
- Let me take a look.
- Yeah, I'm okay.

10:29.222 --> 10:31.061
- Oh, my God!
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

10:31.143 --> 10:32.982
Is she okay? You all right?

10:33.063 --> 10:35.262
- You'll be fine.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

10:37.384 --> 10:39.703
- Damn phone!
- Hey! Are you kidding me?

10:39.704 --> 10:41.464
- Will, have you lost your mind?
- No!

10:41.545 --> 10:43.264
- Shut up!
- That's my career you threw away there!

10:43.346 --> 10:45.546
- There is a girl on the deck of the boat...
- What the hell?

10:45.626 --> 10:47.585
...with her head cut open!
- Martin! Enough!

10:47.706 --> 10:49.466
I'm okay! Seriously.

10:58.228 --> 11:00.988
I'm going into town.
Anybody need anything?

11:01.709 --> 11:05.269
Try to find some antiseptic.
The pharmacy should have some.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.910
Okay, I'm gonna need some cash.

11:09.751 --> 11:11.230
Hurry back, Will.

11:34.757 --> 11:35.995
Gracias.

12:21.125 --> 12:22.604
I love you.

12:24.966 --> 12:27.085
- I got it. Be careful.
- Okay.

13:26.738 --> 13:29.058
Hey. Did you see
where that boat went?

13:43.061 --> 13:47.422
Guys, any of you see a boat?
Like, a sailboat? No?

14:32.791 --> 14:33.751
Mom?

15:09.438 --> 15:11.799
Please, you gotta help me.
Something's happened to my family.

15:13.039 --> 15:14.080
What?

15:14.880 --> 15:16.959
Hey! Something's
happened to my family!

15:17.001 --> 15:19.040
My boat's been ripped to shit
and they're gone!

15:22.921 --> 15:25.441
- I'm Captain Pizarro. You are?
- I'm Will Shaw.

15:29.204 --> 15:30.922
Where are you going?

15:40.805 --> 15:42.725
Take me to the boat.

16:04.451 --> 16:06.929
- Who the hell is that?
- Please, Mr. Shaw, relax.

16:08.570 --> 16:10.929
Will. Can I call you Will?

16:12.211 --> 16:13.451
How do you know my name?

16:14.012 --> 16:15.531
Your mother told me.

16:16.611 --> 16:18.171
- Where is she?
- I can take you to her.

16:18.212 --> 16:20.531
And the rest of your family. Come on.

16:26.655 --> 16:27.773
No, hey!

16:28.454 --> 16:31.294
- Hey! Come on!
- No, no! Hey!

16:31.414 --> 16:33.214
- Come on.
- Hey, let me go! Get off me!

17:06.463 --> 17:07.541
Shit!

18:01.874 --> 18:05.913
Will? Will?
Let's go. Come on. Get up.

18:18.036 --> 18:19.795
Are you okay, Will?

18:20.076 --> 18:22.836
Head hurts.
I just got the shit kicked out of me.

18:26.118 --> 18:28.078
Where's Mom? Where's Josh?

18:29.758 --> 18:31.158
I'm not sure where they are.

18:31.239 --> 18:32.757
What?

18:32.839 --> 18:35.359
I asked you, "Where's Mom? Where's Josh?"
I left them with you.

18:35.479 --> 18:37.279
Men came on the boat.

18:38.400 --> 18:42.080
They put a gun to my head, and they took
your mother and Josh and Dara.

18:42.241 --> 18:44.361
- What the hell is happening?
- I'm sorry.

18:44.521 --> 18:46.962
- Why are you sorry? What?
- I'm sorry.

18:48.363 --> 18:53.762
Will, I don't book gospel quartets
and Picasso experts.

18:54.924 --> 18:57.603
It's not the job I do at the Embassy.

18:58.405 --> 19:01.364
The only thing that's true is that
I've worked for the government a long time.

19:01.446 --> 19:03.164
So what do you do?

19:03.206 --> 19:05.844
It's a branch of the Agency.

19:07.967 --> 19:10.085
It's a special branch of the Agency.

19:12.648 --> 19:15.087
- And Mom and Josh are gone.
- Not like you think.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.607
- Just don't treat me like an idiot.
- I'm not.

19:17.689 --> 19:19.448
- You are! Mom and Josh are gone.
- I'm not treating...

19:19.489 --> 19:22.008
You're CIA
and you don't know where they are?

19:23.771 --> 19:25.089
I'm sorry.

19:28.572 --> 19:30.451
Is it something you did?

19:30.772 --> 19:32.210
It may be, yes.

19:37.773 --> 19:39.693
I'm sorry, Will.

19:39.814 --> 19:42.333
There's no way
I could ever explain that to you.

19:44.335 --> 19:47.653
But we're gonna get your mother back
and Josh back and Dara back.

19:47.735 --> 19:49.575
Try and get some rest.

19:56.777 --> 19:58.337
- Hey.
- Marty, is that you?

19:58.457 --> 20:00.416
- Yeah, it's me.
- What's going on?

20:00.778 --> 20:02.657
- I'm on my way now.
- What's happening?

20:02.698 --> 20:05.177
- Where are you?
- I'm at home. It's 3:00 in the morning.

20:05.219 --> 20:07.058
I need to see you.

20:50.907 --> 20:52.227
Yeah. Let's go. Come on.

20:59.469 --> 21:01.148
I need you to drive.

21:04.190 --> 21:07.550
Diego, I'm gonna meet Carrack.
I need your help.

21:08.031 --> 21:09.750
I'll call you later.

21:59.042 --> 22:00.440
Does Mom know?

22:03.322 --> 22:06.563
Yeah, she knows.
She knows everything.

22:08.883 --> 22:11.002
- She's my wife.
- How could you not tell me this?

22:11.125 --> 22:13.643
There was no way to tell you.
No way, Will.

22:17.924 --> 22:21.084
It would have never been right
to tell you what I do.

22:27.246 --> 22:28.445
Who's that?

22:32.287 --> 22:33.487
A friend.

22:35.287 --> 22:36.728
Just sit tight.

22:39.649 --> 22:41.368
You gonna be all right?

22:46.529 --> 22:48.169
You're a great son.

22:54.772 --> 22:56.492
Be back in a second.

23:20.538 --> 23:22.656
- Are you okay?
- No.

23:23.018 --> 23:25.097
What's going on? Are you hurt?

23:25.418 --> 23:28.017
What did you do? You set me up?

23:28.419 --> 23:31.018
- Did I set you up?
- Did you set me up?

23:31.378 --> 23:35.539
- Marty, what are you talking about?
- They took Laurie and Josh off the boat.

23:35.621 --> 23:36.940
Who did?

23:38.182 --> 23:40.420
I can't help you
if you don't talk to me, Marty.

23:41.261 --> 23:43.341
Who took Laurie? Who did?

23:43.382 --> 23:46.782
The guys we took the briefcase from.
They want it back.

23:47.143 --> 23:49.142
- Shit.
- Who are they, Jean?

23:49.464 --> 23:51.944
They gave me 24 hours,
or they're going to kill them.

23:55.585 --> 23:56.824
Where's the briefcase?

24:00.986 --> 24:04.666
The briefcase went straight up the line.
It's gone.

24:05.347 --> 24:07.505
Carrack, don't fuck with me right now.

24:09.708 --> 24:11.387
- No?
- I'll try.

24:11.428 --> 24:12.867
- No, that's it?
- I'll try.

24:12.909 --> 24:15.789
- Okay, then I'm gonna go.
- Marty, I want to help you.

24:15.790 --> 24:18.308
It went straight up the line.
I don't have it anymore.

24:21.869 --> 24:23.349
You need to fix this.

24:23.590 --> 24:25.229
I'll do my best, Marty.

25:11.720 --> 25:12.758
Dad?

25:20.282 --> 25:21.241
God.

25:26.203 --> 25:27.282
God.

26:05.091 --> 26:06.770
Deal with the body.

26:34.856 --> 26:37.095
- Hello?
- What's the status?

26:37.135 --> 26:40.217
- Someone's trying to kill me.
- Put Tom on the phone.

26:40.258 --> 26:43.297
- Someone shot my father.
- Tell Tom he has less than 21 hours.

26:43.417 --> 26:45.138
Who's Tom? Who the hell are you?

26:45.218 --> 26:46.777
The guy who has your family.

26:46.898 --> 26:48.217
Where do you have...

26:55.341 --> 26:58.060
Hey! Hey, hey! No!

26:58.061 --> 27:01.661
There's a guy who's trying to kill me!

27:01.702 --> 27:04.221
Hold on, this guy's going to kill me!
There's a guy trying to kill me!

27:08.063 --> 27:09.583
Damn it!

27:17.665 --> 27:18.944
Okay, I...

29:46.896 --> 29:48.014
I'm American!

29:48.015 --> 29:49.535
Can you help me?

29:49.536 --> 29:53.576
There's no evidence of a Martin Shaw
with any of our agencies in Spain.

29:53.617 --> 29:56.376
He told us he was a cultural attache.

29:56.497 --> 29:58.817
I thought you said that he wasn't.

30:00.298 --> 30:03.218
My father is dead. Executed. Assassinated.

30:03.338 --> 30:05.618
Mr. Shaw, there's a local warrant
for your arrest.

30:05.699 --> 30:08.739
- It claims you killed a police officer.
- Wait, hold it, hold it. No. No.

30:08.779 --> 30:13.179
Look, the guy who shot my father
was shooting at me halfway across the city.

30:13.220 --> 30:15.660
We can assist you in securing legal counsel

30:15.701 --> 30:17.140
and protecting your rights
as an American citizen.

30:17.222 --> 30:18.861
Look, I did not kill that cop.

30:19.341 --> 30:21.222
But you know what?
We don't have time for this.

30:21.263 --> 30:25.103
My family doesn't have the time.
Will you please help me? Please?

30:25.263 --> 30:28.183
I suggest you accept our help
getting you legal counsel.

30:28.303 --> 30:30.664
- Is there someone else I can talk to?
- Just calm down.

30:30.705 --> 30:32.544
All anyone ever says
to me is calm down.

30:32.585 --> 30:33.943
Tranquilo, tranquilo.

30:34.023 --> 30:35.623
My family has been kidnapped,

30:35.665 --> 30:37.983
and I am wanted for a murder
I did not commit.

30:46.507 --> 30:47.546
Yes?

30:48.948 --> 30:50.227
Yes, ma'am.

30:52.909 --> 30:54.627
Right now, in fact.

30:58.309 --> 31:00.389
Someone needs to talk to you.

31:09.631 --> 31:11.391
Come with us, Mr. Shaw.

31:15.752 --> 31:17.512
Will? It's Jean.

31:18.834 --> 31:22.073
Jean Carrack.
I worked with your father.

31:27.275 --> 31:30.875
You know, I bet if you raise your left hand,
I will see a big white scar

31:30.955 --> 31:33.076
running right across your palm.

31:33.157 --> 31:35.356
You got that making me a martini
when you were 10.

31:35.476 --> 31:36.917
- Don't you remember?
- Hey, yeah. I remember you.

31:38.998 --> 31:42.076
Look, your father has left your family
in a tough spot.

31:42.118 --> 31:43.357
I'd like to help.

31:43.438 --> 31:44.958
Why don't you get in the car
and we'll figure this out?

31:44.999 --> 31:46.119
Okay, if you didn't kill him, who did?

31:47.760 --> 31:49.399
I was there to help him.

31:49.400 --> 31:52.840
I was trying to protect him,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.479
He was not a great listener, your father.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.840
I'll tell you everything I know
when you get in the car.

32:04.083 --> 32:06.481
Will. Come on.

32:08.524 --> 32:12.044
Do you want to save your family?
Because there's an expiration date on that.

32:15.445 --> 32:16.884
Come on, Will.

32:39.609 --> 32:42.489
So who was your father dealing with
about your family?

32:42.569 --> 32:44.290
Who was his contact?

32:45.850 --> 32:47.930
I thought you said
you were gonna do the talking.

32:48.331 --> 32:51.610
If I'm going to help you,
I have to figure out who I'm dealing with.

32:52.212 --> 32:54.852
Did he call anyone? Did he meet anyone?

32:55.932 --> 32:58.693
- Are you all right?
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

32:58.814 --> 32:59.852
- Really?
- Really.

33:00.973 --> 33:02.093
Pull over.

33:14.618 --> 33:15.736
Better?

33:20.537 --> 33:22.657
All right, kid, come on. Let's go.

33:22.698 --> 33:24.097
Senor!

33:24.818 --> 33:26.298
You little...

33:27.939 --> 33:29.259
Forget him.

33:30.699 --> 33:33.860
Come on, let's go.
We'll just get the other one first.

33:39.942 --> 33:42.982
Hey! Get away from there!
Get away from there!

34:23.791 --> 34:24.750
What?

34:26.472 --> 34:28.710
Don't do this to me. Seriously.

34:29.873 --> 34:31.431
Please. I'm...

34:34.154 --> 34:35.112
Thank you.

35:17.081 --> 35:18.080
Yes?

35:20.081 --> 35:22.322
Hello? Are you... Hello?

35:23.643 --> 35:26.163
Tell your son I want to speak to Tom.

35:26.363 --> 35:28.203
- Will?
- Mom!

35:28.284 --> 35:29.443
Mom, are you okay?

35:29.444 --> 35:32.724
Put your father on the phone.
I need to speak to him now.

35:32.725 --> 35:34.724
Mom,

35:34.805 --> 35:35.964
you can't.

35:36.005 --> 35:38.285
Just put him on the phone.

35:38.326 --> 35:39.605
Mom, I can't put him on the phone.

35:39.606 --> 35:41.725
Will, just do as I say.

35:41.726 --> 35:43.286
Mom, I can't.

35:44.047 --> 35:45.367
Where is he?

35:47.487 --> 35:49.407
Mom, they've killed him.

35:51.048 --> 35:52.888
No! No!

35:59.410 --> 36:01.930
Hey! Hey! Calm down.

36:02.051 --> 36:05.850
Tom and I had an agreement.
My briefcase or your family's dead.

36:05.932 --> 36:11.211
Listen, I don't know anything about
your suitcase or briefcase or anything.

36:11.212 --> 36:12.411
Just let my family go.

36:12.853 --> 36:15.332
- This is not going to buy any more time.
- What?

36:15.373 --> 36:17.252
Remind Tom what is at stake.

36:17.293 --> 36:21.773
Look, my dad is dead
and his name was Martin.

36:21.855 --> 36:23.134
You've got the wrong guy.

36:23.215 --> 36:27.254
Tell Tom. 6:00 pm. Puerta del Sol.

36:27.296 --> 36:29.855
My briefcase or your family's dead.

36:59.222 --> 37:00.981
Hello. Do you speak any English?

37:01.063 --> 37:03.702
A little bit. How can I help you?

37:03.743 --> 37:06.542
My name is Will Shaw.
I'm just looking for Diego.

37:06.583 --> 37:07.982
He was a friend of my father's.

37:08.063 --> 37:09.983
Can you give me your address, please?

37:10.064 --> 37:11.382
Yes.

37:13.105 --> 37:14.584
Cruz Street.

37:14.665 --> 37:16.904
34, Suite 502, Madrid.

37:45.031 --> 37:45.990
Hi.

37:49.031 --> 37:50.592
Hi, how are you?

37:50.713 --> 37:52.112
What can I do for you?

37:52.152 --> 37:54.033
- We spoke on the phone.
- Mmm-hmm.

37:54.153 --> 37:55.152
You gave me the directions here.

37:55.194 --> 37:56.353
Mmm-hmm.

37:56.754 --> 37:57.673
Can I help you?

38:01.675 --> 38:03.273
I need to speak to Diego Caldera.

38:03.395 --> 38:05.354
Hey, Will. You feeling better now?

38:36.122 --> 38:38.002
Whoa! Whoa!

38:40.123 --> 38:42.081
Put the gun down! Put the gun down!
Put the gun down!

38:42.203 --> 38:44.923
I only speak goddamn English!

38:44.963 --> 38:46.042
You want to kill my uncle!

38:47.604 --> 38:48.604
Who the hell is your uncle?

38:48.963 --> 38:50.683
Is Diego Caldera your uncle?

38:51.644 --> 38:54.683
Yeah. This cabron comes
in here with a gun

38:54.925 --> 38:57.164
and tells me to sit down and shut up,
waiting for my uncle to come in.

38:57.206 --> 38:59.445
This guy's friends
murdered my father this morning.

39:00.085 --> 39:01.165
Your father was murdered?

39:01.246 --> 39:02.365
That's why I'm here.

39:02.846 --> 39:06.406
My dad called this office
at least a dozen times looking for Diego.

39:06.647 --> 39:08.167
- Where is your uncle then?
- What?

39:08.208 --> 39:10.086
Look, okay? This guy,

39:10.448 --> 39:12.208
his people came looking
here for your uncle.

39:13.169 --> 39:14.327
Where are they going to look next?

39:16.609 --> 39:18.289
Do you really want to be here
when his pals turn up?

39:19.890 --> 39:22.529
Come on. We gotta find your uncle.

39:54.418 --> 39:56.537
- It's open.
- Okay, okay, I've got it.

40:54.109 --> 40:56.588
This kid is all over the damn news.

40:56.668 --> 40:58.989
Why didn't you take care of him
this morning?

40:59.070 --> 41:01.109
Come on, Dixon, answer your phone.

41:01.189 --> 41:02.629
Don't do it!

41:03.350 --> 41:06.430
Hi, Will. Surprise.

41:13.753 --> 41:15.672
Put the gun down, Will.

41:15.673 --> 41:16.673
You're scared,

41:16.793 --> 41:19.713
and scared people holding guns in my face,
that scares me.

41:19.915 --> 41:21.914
Well, this is going to be
a nerve-wracking conversation.

41:21.994 --> 41:23.753
May I sit down?

41:26.236 --> 41:27.595
So,

41:28.716 --> 41:30.556
what can I do for you?

41:31.476 --> 41:32.715
Why did you kill him?

41:33.277 --> 41:34.796
If our situations were reversed,

41:34.877 --> 41:36.757
believe me, your father
would've done the exact same thing.

41:37.198 --> 41:39.117
Why did you kill him?

41:39.157 --> 41:41.838
Your father wanted to give
something back to our enemies

41:41.959 --> 41:44.279
that's a matter
of national security.

41:44.320 --> 41:46.198
You mean the briefcase?

41:49.680 --> 41:52.161
He was about to betray
his country, Will.

41:52.201 --> 41:53.839
And betray us, his team.

41:54.282 --> 41:55.442
I don't believe you.

41:55.641 --> 41:57.561
- Really?
- Honestly, kid,

41:57.961 --> 41:59.081
we don't give a shit.

41:59.642 --> 42:01.961
Maybe I knew him
better than you did.

42:03.842 --> 42:04.843
I want to see my family.

42:05.003 --> 42:06.004
I don't have your family.

42:06.163 --> 42:07.122
Who does?

42:07.324 --> 42:09.644
I'm sorry to say that
some terrorists do.

42:09.804 --> 42:13.444
Will, you are the last person I want
to get more involved in this right now.

42:13.485 --> 42:14.444
But I need your help.

42:15.605 --> 42:18.805
I need you to tell me
who else he saw or spoke to about this.

42:19.047 --> 42:20.246
You give me what I need,

42:20.727 --> 42:23.247
I will pull out all the stops
to help you get your family back.

42:23.808 --> 42:27.286
You need to tell them that my father's
dead and that I've got nothing to do with this.

42:27.607 --> 42:29.208
I just want to save my family!

42:29.809 --> 42:31.128
Right.

42:33.410 --> 42:35.849
So, I certainly think
we owe you something.

42:35.890 --> 42:36.849
Wait, wait, wait. Sit down!

42:41.331 --> 42:43.370
Go! Come on!

42:44.412 --> 42:45.851
Go, go!

42:46.933 --> 42:48.091
Come on!

43:01.214 --> 43:02.173
God damn it!

43:05.336 --> 43:06.294
Get out of the way!

43:07.015 --> 43:07.976
Go! Go! Go!

43:28.780 --> 43:30.500
We gotta find a way down!

43:32.021 --> 43:33.180
There's no way down!

43:37.902 --> 43:38.941
God!

43:49.904 --> 43:52.544
- What are you doing?
- Get your arms up.

43:52.585 --> 43:55.824
- Okay, hold that under your arm.
- No, no. Wait! Are you kidding me?

43:55.866 --> 43:57.904
- Trust me. This is the only way down.
- No, no, no. No way!

43:57.946 --> 43:59.105
This is the only way you're
going to be safe.

43:59.106 --> 44:00.066
No! Are you crazy?

44:06.347 --> 44:07.747
- Lucia!
- No! No way!

44:07.868 --> 44:09.107
Stand still and listen to me!

44:12.709 --> 44:13.909
Are you ready for this?

44:19.310 --> 44:21.190
Will! Don't drop me!

44:36.875 --> 44:37.834
Oh, God!

44:41.956 --> 44:42.915
Stop!

45:40.968 --> 45:42.246
Will! Come on!

45:46.607 --> 45:48.927
Come on!

46:17.175 --> 46:19.494
I've been shot.

46:20.614 --> 46:21.894
She's here!

46:32.617 --> 46:33.536
Will!

46:38.058 --> 46:39.817
No!

46:47.901 --> 46:48.939
Lucky.

46:49.621 --> 46:52.621
- It's fine. It's fine.
- No hospital.

46:52.702 --> 46:54.381
- It's fine.
- No hospital.

46:54.422 --> 46:57.141
It's not a hospital.
My friend can help you here.

46:57.463 --> 47:00.382
- You gotta take me to Puerta del Sol.
- It's fine.

47:02.143 --> 47:04.023
Are you okay?

47:10.544 --> 47:11.502
What is this place?

47:13.185 --> 47:14.384
Chris, please!

47:14.505 --> 47:15.465
Lucia! What happened?

47:15.545 --> 47:17.305
You gotta take me to Puerta del Sol.
I need to find my family.

47:17.386 --> 47:18.704
They killed my uncle!

47:18.907 --> 47:21.265
This guy's wounded!
You have to help me!

47:21.827 --> 47:24.586
No, take him away.
You'll get me into trouble!

47:25.827 --> 47:27.548
You go to medical school, help him!

47:27.828 --> 47:29.507
I'm a student, not a doctor.

47:29.669 --> 47:30.868
Hey!

47:30.949 --> 47:32.628
Cristiana! What's going on?

47:33.749 --> 47:35.148
Habib, call Maximo, we need help!

47:36.270 --> 47:38.429
He's losing lots of blood!
I don't have anywhere to take him.

47:47.591 --> 47:50.713
- When was he shot?
- An hour ago, I think.

47:55.673 --> 47:57.154
Keep him awake.

48:00.395 --> 48:02.313
Talk to me! Please, talk to me!

48:03.915 --> 48:04.996
Where are they?

48:05.076 --> 48:05.994
In the office.

48:06.357 --> 48:07.795
Does she think this is a hospital?

48:07.997 --> 48:09.356
I owe her uncle some favors

48:09.436 --> 48:11.995
but she can't bring a
bleeding guy into my club!

48:12.118 --> 48:13.877
I don't have time for this shit!

48:15.398 --> 48:16.998
What's going on, girls?

48:20.079 --> 48:21.519
Maximo, please.

48:22.360 --> 48:23.998
Maximo, Diego has been killed.

48:24.201 --> 48:25.640
This guy saved my life!

48:26.121 --> 48:27.520
His father's been killed too.

48:28.081 --> 48:30.960
Maximo, hand me that vodka.
I need to sterilize my hands.

48:32.161 --> 48:33.680
Lucia, tell him this
is going to hurt a lot.

48:33.802 --> 48:35.001
I need to see if there's a bullet.

48:35.082 --> 48:36.881
- What's she saying?
- She says not to worry.

48:36.923 --> 48:38.322
You're gonna be fine.

48:44.644 --> 48:47.644
Perfect! There's no bullet.
Now I have to stop the bleeding.

48:47.724 --> 48:50.204
- There is no bullet.
- There is no bullet.

48:50.325 --> 48:52.364
Please, please, please. Okay.

48:52.447 --> 48:54.805
You need a drink, my friend? I do.

48:55.966 --> 48:57.445
Guys, hold him tight!

48:57.686 --> 49:00.766
- What's she doing? What's she doing?
- Okay, she's gonna stop the bleeding.

49:08.847 --> 49:11.127
Well done. Well done, my friend.

49:13.810 --> 49:16.489
Oh! I'm going to puke.

49:41.615 --> 49:42.854
Why did they kill my uncle?

49:44.536 --> 49:45.455
I don't know.

49:45.896 --> 49:48.375
Probably because my father
reached out to him.

49:48.418 --> 49:50.135
I don't know. l'm sorry.

49:51.778 --> 49:54.497
Why do you have a photo of Tom Keaton
on your phone?

49:56.018 --> 49:58.538
That's my father. That's Martin Shaw.

50:00.139 --> 50:01.218
He's your father?

50:02.739 --> 50:03.738
Yes.

50:07.581 --> 50:09.339
- Is he dead? Are you sure he's dead?
- Yes.

50:09.460 --> 50:11.060
Yes, I told you.

50:17.782 --> 50:20.462
Did you know my father? Were you friends?

50:30.185 --> 50:32.304
Friends before anything else.

50:33.506 --> 50:34.865
All my life.

50:40.986 --> 50:44.707
Oh, God. I can't stay here.
I've gotta find my family.

50:44.828 --> 50:46.147
Where do you need to go?

50:46.187 --> 50:47.708
To Puerta del Sol.

50:49.069 --> 50:50.549
So you called your father Martin?

50:50.589 --> 50:53.709
I didn't call him that.
That was his name.

51:00.511 --> 51:02.631
Do you even know what he did?

51:04.432 --> 51:05.991
What do you mean?

51:06.072 --> 51:07.991
What he did for a living.

51:11.393 --> 51:14.072
He said he was a business consultant.

51:14.234 --> 51:16.714
Business consultant. That's rich.

51:25.356 --> 51:28.036
What about you? What do you do?

51:29.396 --> 51:31.876
I used to run a small company.

51:34.718 --> 51:36.877
And what did your small company do?

51:41.319 --> 51:43.039
Business consultants.

51:44.239 --> 51:46.038
Like father, like son.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.880
So you seem to know my father pretty well.
How come?

51:52.040 --> 51:54.120
Were you sleeping with him?

51:58.203 --> 51:59.161
That's what you think?

52:03.963 --> 52:05.403
I wasn't your...

52:05.484 --> 52:06.804
I don't know what
I'm supposed to think.

52:06.844 --> 52:08.563
I wasn't your father's lover.

52:11.605 --> 52:13.084
My mother was.

52:14.525 --> 52:15.645
He was my father, too.

52:38.531 --> 52:40.611
Did you know about his other family?

52:49.974 --> 52:51.692
He was hardly around.

52:54.975 --> 52:56.734
Sometimes I think
the more a parent's absent,

52:59.016 --> 53:00.855
the more you love them.

53:09.097 --> 53:11.657
Next stop, Puerta del Sol.

53:27.020 --> 53:28.780
So, you, too?

53:28.860 --> 53:30.500
I was fine with it.

53:31.822 --> 53:33.301
Sure you were.

53:39.223 --> 53:41.183
And your mother?

53:41.263 --> 53:42.861
What's she like?

53:44.504 --> 53:46.224
My mother is dead.

53:49.385 --> 53:50.703
I'm sorry.

53:58.067 --> 53:59.986
Will! Wait!

54:00.147 --> 54:01.265
Wait.

54:06.268 --> 54:09.148
- Okay.
- I told you. I need to go alone.

54:09.268 --> 54:11.828
If you need me, I'll be at the club.

54:13.189 --> 54:14.468
That's all.

54:14.550 --> 54:15.829
Thank you.

54:15.871 --> 54:18.230
I hope you will get them back.

55:05.801 --> 55:08.319
Keep your hands where I can see them.

55:10.762 --> 55:12.881
Turn around and walk with me.

55:13.442 --> 55:14.681
Where?

55:16.043 --> 55:17.322
Follow me.

56:11.333 --> 56:13.052
Where is your father?

56:18.615 --> 56:20.254
Where's my family?

56:39.500 --> 56:41.539
I've told you,

56:41.620 --> 56:43.179
over and over.

56:44.140 --> 56:46.101
My father is dead.

56:46.741 --> 56:47.780
If you don't believe me,

56:47.821 --> 56:51.581
then have your guy here
really go to town on me.

56:51.621 --> 56:52.981
Sure he'll feel better.

56:53.343 --> 56:56.022
And I still won't know
a goddamned thing.

56:57.183 --> 56:59.663
Even if that's true,
it's still your problem.

57:06.225 --> 57:08.665
Do you know how we come to this, Will?

57:09.866 --> 57:13.425
Two months ago,
one of my men posed as a corrupt agent

57:13.506 --> 57:16.586
willing to sell sensitive pieces of intel
to terrorists.

57:22.548 --> 57:25.386
The mission
was to uncover a rogue CIA operative

57:25.428 --> 57:28.988
we knew was making deals
for his own interest.

57:29.069 --> 57:31.229
So my agent arranged a rendezvous.

57:31.549 --> 57:33.068
And guess who showed up?

57:39.390 --> 57:40.589
Your father killed my agent

57:40.991 --> 57:44.630
and stole a briefcase
that held contents vital to my country.

57:45.312 --> 57:47.310
And now you tell me he's dead?

57:47.352 --> 57:48.633
Agent?

57:49.993 --> 57:50.952
How about terrorist?

57:52.793 --> 57:54.033
Terrorist?

57:56.195 --> 58:00.354
My wife and son met a terrorist once,
in a cafe in Tel Aviv.

58:01.155 --> 58:03.114
In an instant,

58:03.156 --> 58:04.795
they and 15 others

58:05.157 --> 58:06.636
were turned to ash.

58:15.358 --> 58:16.718
So the question becomes

58:17.959 --> 58:19.998
who killed your father?

58:26.680 --> 58:28.841
People from his own agency.

58:30.482 --> 58:32.760
They killed his friend
and they've been trying to kill me, too.

58:32.842 --> 58:34.361
You mean Carrack?

58:34.682 --> 58:35.801
Yeah.

58:38.603 --> 58:42.442
You guys should really get together
and chat about this.

58:42.524 --> 58:44.483
I think you'd get on really...

58:47.045 --> 58:49.724
Perhaps she wants to eliminate you
as a witness,

58:49.765 --> 58:51.405
along with the rest of your family.

58:52.167 --> 58:55.206
Bottom line is that, wherever you go,

58:55.287 --> 58:57.327
they'll be hunting you.

58:58.568 --> 59:01.046
And that will suit our purposes fine.

59:11.210 --> 59:12.569
- Will!
- Will!

59:12.690 --> 59:13.650
- You're alive!
- Guys!

59:13.730 --> 59:15.051
- Has anyone hurt you?
- Will, you're okay!

59:15.091 --> 59:17.170
The irony is,

59:17.291 --> 59:20.570
if your father's killers
are trying to eliminate witnesses,

59:20.611 --> 59:24.412
the only thing keeping your family alive
right now is their captivity.

59:26.413 --> 59:27.732
So here is the deal.

59:27.892 --> 59:30.292
I need you out there to draw her to you.

59:30.373 --> 59:32.572
We know that
some potential buyers are in town.

59:33.094 --> 59:35.013
So we feel that the sale is imminent.

59:36.175 --> 59:37.533
If she really wants to kill you all,

59:38.294 --> 59:40.935
I just need to stay close to you.

59:40.976 --> 59:45.054
But just so we're clear,
if I don't stop Carrack before it's sold,

59:46.697 --> 59:49.095
I won't keep your family any longer.

59:49.257 --> 59:51.937
I'll release them,
and Carrack will kill them.

59:55.339 --> 59:56.657
Understood?

59:58.898 --> 59:59.859
Guys!

59:59.979 --> 01:00:01.338
Will! Wait!

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:55.669
Just get off of me!

01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:58.351
Hey! Get your hands off me! Get off me!

01:00:59.152 --> 01:01:00.471
Let me go!

01:01:01.232 --> 01:01:02.431
Hey, man.

01:01:08.235 --> 01:01:09.553
I need to see Lucia.

01:01:09.674 --> 01:01:11.353
Come. I'll take you.

01:01:33.358 --> 01:01:34.837
Will.

01:01:34.878 --> 01:01:37.118
I've seen them. They're alive.

01:01:38.878 --> 01:01:40.238
I need to get her coming after me.

01:01:40.279 --> 01:01:42.879
It shouldn't be hard, 'cause she's trying
to track me down anyway.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.039
She wants to kill
anyone who knew anything about it.

01:01:45.921 --> 01:01:48.280
And the Israeli said
that the likely buyers are in town tonight.

01:01:48.681 --> 01:01:52.120
So we gotta move,
'cause the deal could happen any time.

01:01:53.282 --> 01:01:54.281
Hey.

01:01:55.203 --> 01:01:56.522
- For you.
- Thank you.

01:01:57.323 --> 01:01:58.922
How much did you hear?

01:01:59.003 --> 01:02:03.003
Along with what Lucia told me before?
Enough.

01:02:03.085 --> 01:02:05.124
This bitch, Carrack,

01:02:07.444 --> 01:02:08.643
she's the one who killed Diego, right?

01:02:09.605 --> 01:02:11.084
So, how can I help?

01:02:13.566 --> 01:02:15.805
They're spies, right? Eyes everywhere?

01:02:16.206 --> 01:02:17.646
Phones, e-mail. Everything.

01:02:18.447 --> 01:02:20.768
Let's start a tab. Then they'll find us.

01:02:20.769 --> 01:02:23.647
Lucia, wait a second.
Are you sure you're ready for this?

01:02:24.808 --> 01:02:26.367
Say my name and you can say it with honor

01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:42.452
She's not working tonight.

01:02:42.453 --> 01:02:43.651
Gracias.

01:03:33.662 --> 01:03:35.423
You don't understand me,
but when you were in school,

01:03:35.463 --> 01:03:38.061
you ever hear the story of Brer Rabbit? Huh?

01:03:59.867 --> 01:04:01.786
- Is it sold?
- Is it sold?

01:04:01.867 --> 01:04:03.788
Jesus Christ!
You're dumber than your father.

01:04:03.868 --> 01:04:05.708
What are you actually asking me, Will?

01:04:06.588 --> 01:04:10.268
"Is it sold?" What's sold? The briefcase?
Or is your family dead?

01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:13.069
'Cause if it's sold, they're dead. Right?

01:04:17.111 --> 01:04:19.030
The deal's gonna happen.

01:04:19.791 --> 01:04:23.471
And the only way you'll know where
is if you make me tell you.

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:25.193
But I ain't telling you shit.

01:04:25.313 --> 01:04:26.352
No!

01:04:31.274 --> 01:04:32.633
Get him up!

01:04:33.115 --> 01:04:35.034
- Untie him!
- He'll kill you, man.

01:04:39.756 --> 01:04:40.675
Will!

01:04:40.756 --> 01:04:42.475
- Get off me!
- We'll do this!

01:04:43.196 --> 01:04:45.196
- Get off me! Get off me!
- We'll do this!

01:04:46.877 --> 01:04:48.997
Where's Carrack? Answer me!

01:04:50.118 --> 01:04:52.597
Tell me! Where is she?
Why isn't she here?

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:55.078
- Why isn't she here?
- Because!

01:04:56.319 --> 01:04:57.679
She's a lady.

01:04:58.079 --> 01:05:01.239
And ladies, unlike your little sister,

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.040
stay at home while the men go out...

01:05:06.601 --> 01:05:08.841
Kick the shit out of him!

01:05:09.281 --> 01:05:11.801
- Don't worry. He'll talk.
- Just tape him up. We've done enough.

01:05:11.843 --> 01:05:13.962
I know that it's not easy to watch,
but it will work.

01:05:14.003 --> 01:05:15.322
- No, it won't.
- It will.

01:05:15.363 --> 01:05:17.442
- I've got a plan.
- The duct tape won't hold.

01:05:17.484 --> 01:05:21.203
We have to let him go.
We need a car.

01:05:22.725 --> 01:05:25.524
- I don't understand.
- Promise me you won't go in there.

01:05:25.645 --> 01:05:27.004
I still don't understand.

01:05:27.045 --> 01:05:30.085
He thinks I'm an idiot.
Let me deliver on that.

01:05:37.607 --> 01:05:40.526
Dad was no traitor.
Carrack played him.

01:05:41.807 --> 01:05:43.128
Played him and the Israelis.

01:05:43.168 --> 01:05:46.248
- And the Israelis are out there?
- They better be.

01:06:08.333 --> 01:06:09.973
There.

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:43.060
They are on the move.

01:06:43.181 --> 01:06:44.900
Stay close to them.
Call me if she shows up.

01:06:44.981 --> 01:06:45.940
Ok.

01:07:09.507 --> 01:07:10.944
He got away.

01:07:11.706 --> 01:07:13.585
I'll deal with him later.

01:07:13.626 --> 01:07:16.467
Let's hope for your sake
he doesn't show up.

01:07:47.032 --> 01:07:48.792
There. Pull over.

01:07:52.514 --> 01:07:53.593
Be careful.

01:08:20.799 --> 01:08:22.719
- Stay here, okay?
- Okay. What are you gonna do?

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.198
Wait for them.

01:08:29.841 --> 01:08:32.921
I'm glad to see
you brought what I was expecting.

01:08:43.684 --> 01:08:47.604
Yeah, I ran into a little bit of trouble,
but it's been dealt with.

01:08:52.687 --> 01:08:55.486
Shh! Come with me.

01:08:57.488 --> 01:08:59.767
- We're on your side.
- Okay.

01:09:03.768 --> 01:09:06.448
So, gentlemen, if you're ready,
we can do our business.

01:09:06.729 --> 01:09:08.769
How can I be sure
this is the real thing?

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:11.170
It came directly
from a Mossad agent.

01:09:11.529 --> 01:09:13.370
Sadly, no eyewitnesses.

01:09:14.171 --> 01:09:17.131
You're not gonna find anything else
like this one.

01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:19.810
Shh!

01:09:19.932 --> 01:09:21.212
Crawl back out of here.

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:23.133
We'll take over now.

01:09:24.173 --> 01:09:26.212
No. Tell me where my family is
or I'm not going anywhere.

01:09:26.894 --> 01:09:29.613
Listen to me.
Leave now or I'll have to drag you out.

01:09:29.694 --> 01:09:31.094
- No!
- Leave now!

01:09:40.856 --> 01:09:41.975
Catch.

01:11:01.472 --> 01:11:03.232
Lucia! Calm down.

01:11:07.514 --> 01:11:09.393
It's okay. It's okay.

01:11:09.994 --> 01:11:11.354
You, Will?

01:11:17.596 --> 01:11:19.235
Of all the people

01:11:20.917 --> 01:11:22.836
who should've killed me.

01:11:35.839 --> 01:11:37.440
Will! She's coming.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.879
No! No! No!

01:12:36.611 --> 01:12:38.731
You amateur!

01:12:53.615 --> 01:12:56.175
Hurry up. Hurry up. Go, go, go!

01:13:05.377 --> 01:13:06.537
Watch it!

01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:15.670
Whoo!

01:14:26.233 --> 01:14:27.393
- Come on!
- Please! No!

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:57.719
Jesus!

01:15:08.882 --> 01:15:11.602
No, no, no! No!

01:15:12.843 --> 01:15:14.243
God! Damn!

01:15:21.845 --> 01:15:23.244
- Where are they?
- Who?

01:15:23.286 --> 01:15:24.564
The Israelis. Where are they?

01:15:29.367 --> 01:15:30.486
Shit!

01:15:44.610 --> 01:15:45.889
Where is she? Where is she?

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:48.570
She's there!

01:15:58.652 --> 01:16:00.371
No, no, no! Wait, wait! Don't!

01:16:04.613 --> 01:16:06.293
Come on!

01:16:19.536 --> 01:16:21.455
Who's going to pay for my car now?

01:16:32.819 --> 01:16:35.018
- Lucia! Get out. Come on, come on!
- What?

01:16:52.542 --> 01:16:53.543
All right! That's it!

01:16:56.344 --> 01:16:59.263
I'm getting sick of this. Come on.

01:17:00.265 --> 01:17:02.023
She's coming! She's coming!

01:17:02.985 --> 01:17:04.065
Come on!

01:17:06.945 --> 01:17:08.146
God damn!

01:17:44.994 --> 01:17:46.514
Carrack, you bitch!

01:19:05.249 --> 01:19:07.049
Oh, Will.

01:19:09.971 --> 01:19:11.369
What a mess.

01:19:13.451 --> 01:19:15.811
Looks like you're gonna need
some more stitches.

01:19:16.612 --> 01:19:18.890
And your little dead friend, too.

01:19:19.492 --> 01:19:21.572
Your mother's gonna freak out.

01:19:22.693 --> 01:19:26.013
Aw! Is that your father's gun?

01:19:28.134 --> 01:19:29.453
I'm sorry.

01:19:33.495 --> 01:19:35.135
You looking for something like this?

01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:55.379
Will!

01:20:31.307 --> 01:20:33.505
My sister. She's hurt back there.

01:20:33.787 --> 01:20:36.627
Relax. She's halfway to the hospital.

01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:44.750
Your father, for all
the hell he caused us,

01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:48.710
would be proud of you.

01:20:52.151 --> 01:20:53.949
What about my family?

01:21:08.755 --> 01:21:12.754
Oh, my God!

01:21:46.562 --> 01:21:49.562
You handled yourself pretty well out there
for a kid who knows shit.

01:21:49.803 --> 01:21:51.603
I have to tell you, I was impressed.

01:21:53.843 --> 01:21:56.684
Thanks for helping us
clean up our own mess.

01:21:58.005 --> 01:21:59.444
Does this mean I can go home now?

01:21:59.565 --> 01:22:00.964
Sure. Whatever.

01:22:01.165 --> 01:22:03.524
But I think you should really consider
another line of work.

01:22:05.045 --> 01:22:08.486
You know, your father
was an honest man.

01:22:09.247 --> 01:22:10.965
I'm sorry he's gone.

01:22:12.727 --> 01:22:14.046
Thank you.

01:22:14.767 --> 01:22:16.647
Could I ask you something?

01:22:17.288 --> 01:22:18.447
Shoot.

01:22:19.609 --> 01:22:21.527
What the hell was in the briefcase?

01:22:21.730 --> 01:22:23.288
There's only one way I can answer that.

01:22:29.211 --> 01:22:31.130
I've gotta go see my family.

01:22:41.053 --> 01:22:41.971
Hey.

01:22:43.213 --> 01:22:44.492
Thank you.

01:22:52.255 --> 01:22:54.334
You told her about me, right?

01:22:56.296 --> 01:22:58.576
It didn't really seem important.

01:22:59.456 --> 01:23:01.177
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

01:23:06.978 --> 01:23:09.337
You should go and introduce yourself.

01:23:09.378 --> 01:23:11.059
She is your sister.

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:14.178
She is my sister.
