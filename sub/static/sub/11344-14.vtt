(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:08.209 --> 00:12.046
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.448
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.482 --> 00:16.384
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.417 --> 00:18.086
are members
of an elite squad

00:18.119 --> 00:19.720
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.753 --> 00:22.290
These are their stories.

00:22.690 --> 00:23.791
Angel!

00:23.824 --> 00:25.359
Come back here.
I mean it!

00:25.393 --> 00:27.228
Angel!

00:27.261 --> 00:29.397
Angel, come back here!

00:29.430 --> 00:30.364
Angel!

00:30.398 --> 00:31.765
Can you grab my dog?

00:31.799 --> 00:33.401
Ah, got her!

00:33.434 --> 00:36.770
Bad dog, Angel.
Bad, bad dog.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.640
What's that you got hold of,
little pooch?

00:39.673 --> 00:42.410
That looks like afterbirth.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.278
She just have puppies?
No.

00:44.312 --> 00:45.279
Well, I've had three kids.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.814
I'm pretty sure.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.816
That's human.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.619
You know, in some cultures,
they bury the placenta,

00:51.652 --> 00:53.321
plant a tree over it.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.788
Well, Angel dug this one
out of someone's trash.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.457
Well, it could've been
a home birth.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.292
And they just threw it out.
Is that legal?

00:58.326 --> 00:59.360
Well, it's stupid.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.429
A lot of parents are freezing
and storing them now.

01:01.462 --> 01:02.463
For what?

01:02.496 --> 01:04.165
Stem cells.

01:04.198 --> 01:06.400
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
[growls]

01:06.434 --> 01:07.768
Angel.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:07.801 --> 01:09.470
Angel. Angel.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.839
[baby crying]

01:21.815 --> 01:22.883
(man)
Baby Boy Doe.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.153
Six pounds,
two ounces, Caucasian.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.287
How long
was he in the trash?

01:26.320 --> 01:28.122
He couldn't have been born
more than two, three hours

01:28.156 --> 01:29.123
before they found him.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.558
Garbage truck
was a block away.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.493
His umbilical cord
was clamped off with this.

01:32.526 --> 01:33.561
Or he'd have bled to death.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.629
"Gourmet Coffee."

01:35.663 --> 01:37.898
Well, I guess
he interrupted breakfast.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.500
What are his chances?

01:39.533 --> 01:40.901
He was lethargic
from dehydration

01:40.934 --> 01:43.671
and hypothermia,
but otherwise healthy.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.839
We got fluids
and formula in him.

01:45.873 --> 01:48.509
Some nice,
warming lights.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.512
And he perked right up.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.447
Never got to bond
with his mother.

01:53.481 --> 01:57.418
He needs all the human
contact he can get.

02:05.859 --> 02:08.429
Welcome to the world, there,
tough guy.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.714
Sanitation picked up
all the garbage.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.217
Dog owner kept him from
hauling away our crime scene.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.618
Let's hope our mother
didn't have twins.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.720
Baby was stuffed in a bag
with these old clothes

03:06.754 --> 03:07.988
and sheets.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.458
The box was meant
to be his coffin.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.560
Any identifying marks on it?

03:12.593 --> 03:14.962
No. Placenta must've
been wrapped in that.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.230
God.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.765
Those sheets
that she gave birth on.

03:17.798 --> 03:18.966
A lot of blood.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.001
Yeah, stains are probably
amniotic fluid.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.271
A low thread count but...

03:23.304 --> 03:24.805
Nice stitching
on the border.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.840
Color's taupe.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.578
Who lives here?

03:30.611 --> 03:31.945
Joe and Candace Shepherd.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.247
Fin's inside
with them now.

03:33.281 --> 03:34.482
What do we know about them?

03:34.515 --> 03:36.550
Based on the anthropological
profile of their garbage,

03:36.584 --> 03:38.952
I'd say he's a conservative,
she's a liberal.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.289
Favorite food is Moo Shoo Pork
from Wok This Way.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.691
Had it delivered three times
in the last week.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.959
Sounds like somebody
had a craving.

03:45.993 --> 03:47.628
I don't think Mrs. Shepard
could have been pregnant.

03:47.661 --> 03:48.862
Why not?

03:48.896 --> 03:50.864
I'm 51 years old.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.867
I read a woman in Romania
gave birth at 66.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.036
(man)
That was artificial
insemination.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.606
After about 10 years
of fertility treatments.

03:58.639 --> 03:59.873
If we went
to that much trouble,

03:59.907 --> 04:01.041
why would we
just throw it away?

04:01.074 --> 04:02.676
Okay, just 'cause
it wasn't you

04:02.710 --> 04:05.045
doesn't mean someone else
in this house didn't give birth.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.647
It's just
the two of us now.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.048
Any of your neighbors
in the family way?

04:08.081 --> 04:09.182
No.

04:09.216 --> 04:12.653
But there is that poor woman
at our coffee place...Varla.

04:12.686 --> 04:13.787
Varla works there?

04:13.821 --> 04:15.489
She panhandles out front.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.725
Can you imagine anything
worse than being homeless

04:17.758 --> 04:20.260
and pregnant?

04:22.095 --> 04:24.665
Gonna spend five bucks
on a cup of coffee in there.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.067
You can get it at the Korean
deli for 75 cents.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.002
Give the extra four bucks
and a quarter

04:29.036 --> 04:30.338
to somebody
who really needs it.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.473
You look cold.
Let us buy you a coffee.

04:32.506 --> 04:33.507
I don't touch the stuff.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.376
I had to give up caffeine
when I got pregnant.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.777
Well, actually,
that's what we wanted

04:36.810 --> 04:38.379
to talk to you about,
Varla.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.314
You can't take my baby!
Please!

04:40.348 --> 04:42.049
Varla!
[sobbing]
Don't let them take my baby.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.817
Who's trying
to take your baby?

04:43.851 --> 04:45.853
Social Services.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.855
No drugs this time.
My baby will be born clean.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.557
I swear!

04:49.590 --> 04:50.858
Are you saying that
you're still pregnant?

04:50.891 --> 04:54.094
What, are you blind?
I'm ready to pop.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.963
Okay, let us take you
to see a doctor

04:55.996 --> 04:57.798
just to make sure
the baby's okay.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.867
It's okay.
Come on.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.936
Let's go.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.406
I was using all through
my first three pregnancies.

05:05.439 --> 05:08.576
All my babies tested positive
at birth for crack.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.043
ACS took them away.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.346
I stayed clean this time.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.714
How long?
Eight months.

05:13.747 --> 05:14.982
This won't hurt at all.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.618
I swore to do right
by this one.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.987
[ultrasound waves]

05:20.020 --> 05:21.121
This is the uterus.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.492
Oh, I get to see
my baby on that?

05:24.525 --> 05:27.595
No, Varla.

05:27.628 --> 05:28.929
You threw him away.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.664
No, he's inside me.
No.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.633
He's at the hospital.
Look, you see that?

05:32.666 --> 05:35.503
You see? There's no baby
inside you, Varla.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.705
This is a trick.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.040
How could they steal my baby
without me knowing it?

05:40.073 --> 05:42.510
Why? I did everything
right this time!

05:42.543 --> 05:43.977
I need to place you
under arrest.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.447
[crying]
Detective...

05:46.480 --> 05:49.116
You don't have
to do that.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.118
Varla hasn't recently
been pregnant.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.120
Her belly
is still swollen.

05:53.153 --> 05:56.056
I believe she's suffering
from pseudocyesis.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.559
What's that?

05:58.592 --> 06:00.561
It's a rare
psychosomatic condition

06:00.594 --> 06:02.062
in which a woman
who's not pregnant

06:02.095 --> 06:03.931
exhibits all the signs
of pregnancy.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.066
Absence of periods,
morning sickness,

06:06.099 --> 06:07.601
abdominal distension.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.403
A fruitcake
with baby fever.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.972
Woman at risk are in their
late 30s to early 40s.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.574
Wanted desperately
to have children,

06:13.607 --> 06:14.975
but were unable
to conceive.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.110
Well, Varla's 41,
but she's had three kids.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.812
All taken away
by the state.

06:18.846 --> 06:21.148
Pseudocyesis can also occur
when a woman has miscarried

06:21.181 --> 06:21.949
or lost a child.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.484
Then if there's no baby
in there,

06:23.517 --> 06:24.952
what makes the belly
so big?

06:24.985 --> 06:26.019
That one's still

06:26.053 --> 06:27.120
a medical mystery.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.155
Well, here's another one.

06:28.188 --> 06:31.425
Why would a mother throw
her own baby in the trash?

06:31.459 --> 06:33.427
Where are we
on the canvass?

06:33.461 --> 06:35.463
Baby was dumped here.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.130
We've done these four blocks.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.432
Mother couldn't have
traveled very far

06:38.466 --> 06:39.433
after giving birth.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.901
Assuming she's the one
that dumped the baby.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.703
Could be the husband,
boyfriend, parent.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.137
Drunken genius.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.639
The crime lab
cleaned the T-shirt

06:45.673 --> 06:47.040
the placenta was wrapped in.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.476
Blood obscured a logo.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.210
"Einstein's Drunken Genius."

06:50.243 --> 06:51.879
(Benson)
What does that mean?

06:51.912 --> 06:54.114
I did a narcotics bust
at Einstein's bar once.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.916
It's a college hangout
right outside

06:55.949 --> 06:57.951
the Manhattan
Institute of Technology.

06:57.985 --> 07:00.854
That's six blocks
from the crime scene.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.560
That T-shirt's from a promo
we ran back in October.

07:06.594 --> 07:07.895
Trivia contest.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.063
Geared toward the eggheads
of Man.I.T.?

07:10.097 --> 07:13.033
Yeah...but the gimmick was
you had to take a short IQ test

07:13.066 --> 07:15.068
after downing
four shots of Tequila.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.169
The winner
is a drunken genius.

07:16.203 --> 07:19.540
October...mother would have
been six months pregnant.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.474
You remember
a pregnant winner?

07:20.508 --> 07:22.976
A few had what I assume
were beer bellies.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.845
How many of those T-shirts
have you given away?

07:24.878 --> 07:25.713
One a day for a month.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.848
Any chance you got
a list of the winners?

07:27.881 --> 07:29.116
Well, they're
automatically enrolled

07:29.149 --> 07:30.684
into Einstein's
Quantum Drink Club.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.953
I got all their names
and addresses.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.489
I don't wanna think about how
many brain cells I had to kill

07:35.523 --> 07:37.024
to win that moronic shirt.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.058
Didn't even fit me.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.493
You still have it?

07:39.527 --> 07:41.128
My ex-roommate borrowed it.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.730
Never gave it back.

07:42.763 --> 07:43.731
What's her name?

07:43.764 --> 07:45.065
Ella Christensen.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.735
She moved into a single
down the hall.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.037
Well, I'm pretty sure I gave
that shirt back to Heather.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.673
Well, she's positive
that you still have it.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.275
And we really need
to account for every one.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.544
Well, I can look.

07:56.577 --> 07:57.811
Good.
Thank you.

07:59.947 --> 08:03.551
I think I only wore it once,
to work out in.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.593
Got a serious coffee habit.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.595
Well, with my course load,
I have to.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.530
Gourmet coffee.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.568
You're missing a clip.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.235
Huh? Excuse me?

08:22.269 --> 08:24.104
How you doing
with that T-shirt?

08:24.137 --> 08:25.639
Sorry, Heather
must be mistaken.

08:25.673 --> 08:29.176
I love these pillowcases.
What is that, taupe?

08:29.209 --> 08:30.778
Yeah, I guess.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.647
Nice border, Ella.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.015
What are you doing?

08:36.316 --> 08:38.819
Where are
the matching sheets?

08:45.058 --> 08:46.660
So how old are you, Ella?

08:46.694 --> 08:48.061
20.
20!

08:48.095 --> 08:48.896
Just a kid.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.831
Way too young to be
starting a family.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.834
Yeah, it's not even something
I've thought about.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.135
I'm not pregnant.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.770
Not anymore.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.071
I've never been pregnant.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.173
So would consent
to a medical exam?

09:00.207 --> 09:00.874
Why?

09:00.908 --> 09:02.743
To eliminate you
as the person

09:02.776 --> 09:04.344
who gave birth
in that dorm room.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.179
No one gave birth
in my dorm room.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.749
I don't even know anyone
that's been pregnant.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.218
You look just like him.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.086
Who?

09:13.120 --> 09:14.588
Your son.

09:14.622 --> 09:15.923
I don't--this--

09:15.956 --> 09:18.058
I don't have a son.
Carried him nine months.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.060
You didn't want him,
you had legal options.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.162
You have a problem with
abortion, that's your choice.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.131
I understand that.
There's adoption.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.836
You chose to give birth!

09:30.170 --> 09:31.839
You have the wrong person.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.207
You chose to walk
six blocks with him,

09:34.241 --> 09:36.243
right past a firehouse!

09:36.276 --> 09:38.245
A hospital where,
under safe haven laws,

09:38.278 --> 09:40.914
you could have just
left him anonymously!

09:40.948 --> 09:42.883
Why are you yelling at me?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.718
Because you tossed him
in the trash,

09:44.752 --> 09:47.120
like the garbage you are!

09:47.154 --> 09:50.624
All those choices...

09:50.658 --> 09:52.359
How is that even an option?

09:54.762 --> 09:56.263
[door opens]

09:56.296 --> 09:58.966
Liv, Elliot...

09:58.999 --> 10:00.233
Could I see you a second?

10:12.345 --> 10:14.782
(Benson)
I don't see her
lawyering up on us.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.249
(Cragen)
Interrogation 101:

10:16.283 --> 10:19.052
Overcoming resistance
through compassion.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.153
I can't.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.122
Not with this one.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.123
It's Saturday.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.191
Holding that kid,

10:24.224 --> 10:27.127
she just...

10:27.160 --> 10:28.261
threw away...

10:28.295 --> 10:31.264
Kathy still has custody.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.304
It's my week,
and the day's half gone.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.238
I'm still here.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.439
Look, Captain...

10:39.472 --> 10:42.943
DNA's gonna close
the case on this one.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.212
Go on.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.214
Be with your kids.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.020
Munch and Fin are
executing the search warrant

10:53.053 --> 10:54.154
on the dorm.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.724
That should be enough
for a court order to take DNA?

10:56.757 --> 10:59.827
You just keep Ella from leaving
until it comes through.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.195
[door opens]

11:02.229 --> 11:05.766
Manhattan Institute
of Technology.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.267
That's impressive.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.302
You have to be a genius
to get in, don't you?

11:09.336 --> 11:12.172
I'm on a full
academic scholarship.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.474
Wow.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.876
What's your major?

11:15.909 --> 11:17.878
Um, Environmental
Engineering.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.046
So, what, you're a junior?

11:19.079 --> 11:20.413
Means you only have
one more year to go?

11:23.884 --> 11:26.286
I could understand
how devastating that would be.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.889
Be so close, and then...

11:28.922 --> 11:30.758
have to give it all up.

11:30.791 --> 11:34.227
How much longer
do I have to stay here?

11:34.261 --> 11:35.295
Know what, Ella?

11:35.328 --> 11:37.030
You'd really
be doing me a favor

11:37.064 --> 11:39.132
if you could just
hang in a little longer.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.104
[sighs]

11:44.137 --> 11:46.139
You cold?

11:46.173 --> 11:47.174
Yeah, it's freezing in here.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.909
Then why
are you sweating?

11:52.379 --> 11:54.014
I can understand why
you're so nervous, Ella.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.283
I'm nervous
because I have to study.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.418
I mean, seriously,
I have to go.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.486
You know what, Ella?
Wait.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.487
Just explain this to me.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.189
[paper shuffling]

12:02.222 --> 12:04.424
These are the sheets
that were found with the baby.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.961
This matches your pillowcase.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.096
Will you explain that to me?

12:09.129 --> 12:10.430
Everybody
has those sheets.

12:10.463 --> 12:13.400
They're from the university
laundry service.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.434
Where are your sheets now?

12:14.467 --> 12:18.238
My pen leaked on them.
I threw them out last week.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.173
Great.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.408
Sheets were pretty much
all we had

12:21.441 --> 12:22.943
to justify
the search warrant.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.978
And everyone has them.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.880
What about the DNA test?

12:26.914 --> 12:28.148
We can't get one now.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.250
Why?
CSU found nothing.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.985
Not so much as
an e-mail mention

12:32.019 --> 12:33.053
or a baby-related
Google search

12:33.086 --> 12:34.054
on her computer.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.155
What about her mattress?

12:35.188 --> 12:37.124
No blood,
no amniotic fluid, nothing.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.192
Then she either did
an amazing cleanup job

12:39.226 --> 12:40.527
or used a plastic sheet

12:40.560 --> 12:41.995
and got rid of it
somewhere else.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.396
Or she isn't the mother.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.333
Get an order compelling her
to undergo a medical exam.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.468
I overreached
on the search warrant.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.871
No judge is gonna order
an invasive procedure

12:50.904 --> 12:53.140
based on a whiff
of circumstantial evidence.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.475
Well, then,
she is gonna bolt.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.115
She had to tell someone.

13:03.516 --> 13:07.054
Find me somebody quick
who knew she was pregnant.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.894
(man)
No way was
Ella Christensen pregnant.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.963
(Fin)
It's winter.
Everybody's bundled up.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.530
Could she have been
hiding her weight gain?

13:17.564 --> 13:18.465
Look, I'm probably going

13:18.498 --> 13:20.333
to have to retake
Differential Equations

13:20.367 --> 13:22.469
because all I do
is stare at her.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.571
She's a goddess.
Her body is perfect.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.306
Outside of your dreams,

13:26.339 --> 13:29.242
how much of her body
have you really seen?

13:29.276 --> 13:30.543
I've never dated
anyone at school.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.479
Well, what about
outside of school?

13:32.512 --> 13:34.147
Do you have
a boyfriend?

13:34.181 --> 13:35.215
No.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.416
Oh, a pretty girl
like yourself,

13:36.449 --> 13:38.451
you must have
plenty of offers.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.221
I've always just been
more focused on my studies.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.123
(Munch)
Did Ella show up
for class yesterday?

13:43.156 --> 13:44.324
10:00 a.m. sharp.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.625
Sat in the front row.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.327
Did she seem like
she was in any pain?

13:47.360 --> 13:48.595
They all were.

13:48.628 --> 13:51.464
I gave a test on Eigenvectors
and Undetermined Coefficients.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.465
Well, how did Ellen do?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.634
I might have misplaced
an exponential factor,

13:54.667 --> 13:56.069
but otherwise,
I think I aced it.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.270
Are you okay?

13:57.304 --> 13:59.072
Cramps. I think
I'm getting my period.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.340
I really have to go.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.375
Ooh.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.610
You know, women
don't get their period

14:03.643 --> 14:05.578
for six to eight weeks
after giving birth.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.647
Then I wish I had
given birth then.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.383
I always find it fascinating
how female roommates

14:10.417 --> 14:12.352
sync up on their periods.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.321
Did that happen
with you and Heather?

14:14.354 --> 14:15.622
Not that I know of.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.224
You two get along?

14:17.257 --> 14:18.491
She's a sweet girl.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.526
Then why'd you move out?

14:19.559 --> 14:22.562
[panting]

14:22.595 --> 14:24.364
I think I'm gonna be sick.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.899
Ella, you need
to see a doctor.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.367
No, I just
need to go home.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.468
Ella, listen to me.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.570
Let me take you
to a hospital, okay?

14:31.704 --> 14:34.574
Ella! Ella!

14:34.607 --> 14:36.509
I need some help here!

14:36.543 --> 14:39.212
[bell rings]
Somebody call a bus, now!

14:39.246 --> 14:41.481
Ella?

14:48.621 --> 14:50.623
Hey, how is she doing?

14:50.657 --> 14:52.392
She'll be fine,
thanks to you.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.361
It's a good thing you
brought her in when you did.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.929
Complications
from childbirth?

14:55.963 --> 14:57.430
I'm afraid I can't tell.

14:57.464 --> 14:58.598
Well, you examined her.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.300
Isn't it obvious if she
just gave birth?

15:00.333 --> 15:02.035
You're misunderstanding me.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.536
I'm saying I
can't tell you.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.438
I'd be breeching
doctor-patient privilege.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.108
You examined a suspect earlier
right in front of me.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.676
I had that
patient's consent.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.079
And if I remember correctly,
you were equally convinced

15:12.112 --> 15:13.981
that woman was guilty
of a crime she didn't commit.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.015
This is crazy.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.084
I had a court order
in the works

15:17.117 --> 15:18.318
right before
she passed out.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.686
That's all I need.

15:19.719 --> 15:22.990
Come and find me
when you have it.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.358
[breathing heavily]

15:28.028 --> 15:30.964
I just talked with
Dr. Aiken, Ella.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.201
She told me everything.

15:34.234 --> 15:38.005
"Retained products
of conception."

15:38.038 --> 15:40.407
That's what
the doctor called it.

15:41.774 --> 15:45.445
Part of the placenta was still
attached to the uterine wall.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.981
Causing a massive infection.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.216
I was septic.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.187
I could have died.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.990
Ella...

15:57.024 --> 15:58.325
Why didn't you
go to the doctor earlier

15:58.358 --> 15:59.993
to have this baby?

16:01.161 --> 16:03.763
I had no idea
I was pregnant.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.999
Missing your period
for nine months wasn't a clue?

16:06.033 --> 16:08.501
I swear, I had no idea.

16:08.535 --> 16:09.736
I didn't know.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.471
You had to have
figured it out at some point.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.441
No, not until it...

16:14.474 --> 16:16.643
came out of me.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.546
And you just panicked.

16:19.579 --> 16:22.215
It doesn't seem real.
It just couldn't be real.

16:22.249 --> 16:27.620
And I didn't see why
I was still being punished.

16:27.654 --> 16:32.059
For having sex?

16:34.061 --> 16:35.995
For being raped.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.705
Why haven't you arrested
Ella Christensen?

16:45.738 --> 16:47.740
She's not going anywhere.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.342
I have a guard on her
at the hospital.

16:49.376 --> 16:52.545
I just...wanted to look
into this rape allegation.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.746
She never reported
being raped.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.782
60% of rape victims don't.

16:55.815 --> 16:56.783
And a bigger percent aren't

16:56.816 --> 16:58.685
looking at attempted
Murder in the Second Degree.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.520
Ella was traumatized.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.255
Even if she was raped,

17:02.289 --> 17:04.757
it doesn't excuse trying
to kill the result of it.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.060
But it would affect
how you charge her.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.263
"Genius throws baby in trash."

17:10.297 --> 17:12.265
How do you think
I should charge her?

17:12.299 --> 17:14.367
Wire service
picked up the story.

17:14.401 --> 17:17.370
I just got a call from
Samaritan Hospital in Newark.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.739
Nurse there remembers
Ella from about a year ago.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.274
She was raped.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.243
No...
she had just given birth,

17:23.276 --> 17:25.345
but didn't have
a newborn to show for it.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.080
They called the cops.

17:27.114 --> 17:29.582
This nutcase

17:29.616 --> 17:33.052
is a serial baby killer.

17:40.327 --> 17:41.661
(Fin)
You investigated
Ella Christensen

17:41.694 --> 17:43.663
back in August, 2004.

17:43.696 --> 17:44.664
Yeah, that was mine.

17:44.697 --> 17:45.765
Nice work there.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.434
Look, I sat with her
for six hours.

17:47.467 --> 17:48.701
The poor kid was only 18.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.670
She hadn't gained
more than 10 pounds.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.372
She had no idea
that she was pregnant.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.341
You never arrested her.
You never filed a single charge.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.208
I had no case.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.477
What did she say
happened to the baby?

17:57.510 --> 17:58.545
She disposed of it
herself.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.747
For future reference,
that's called Murder Two.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.182
She said the baby
was stillborn,

18:02.215 --> 18:03.883
and I had no evidence
to the contrary.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.253
The garbage had
already been picked up.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.655
Yeah, and who wants to go
through a Newark dump in August?

18:09.756 --> 18:11.758
We found the remains
a few weeks later.

18:11.791 --> 18:12.625
By then, the doctors
couldn't tell us

18:12.659 --> 18:14.694
if the kid had ever
taken a breath.

18:14.727 --> 18:15.862
She killed that baby.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.364
The most I
could have gotten her on

18:17.397 --> 18:18.765
is illegal disposal
of a corpse.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.401
A misdemeanor
and her first offense.
Not her last.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.569
If you'd charged her,

18:22.602 --> 18:23.603
maybe she would have
thought twice

18:23.636 --> 18:24.504
before doing it again.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.606
How come this never
made it into the news?

18:26.639 --> 18:29.409
Ella's father
is a city councilman.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.411
Everett Drake.

18:34.181 --> 18:36.649
(man)
There was no impropriety.

18:36.683 --> 18:40.253
I did nothing to impede
the investigation.

18:40.287 --> 18:44.257
It was a tragic situation.
Ella had been through enough.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.292
Apparently not.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.659
We didn't raise her,
you know.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.396
That was Everett's
first wife.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.763
They divorced
when she was a baby.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.765
The Gila monster moved
to Colorado with her

18:52.799 --> 18:54.734
and cut off all contact.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.270
Ella just popped back
into our lives

18:57.304 --> 18:59.239
about 2 1/2 years ago.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.773
When she came here
for college.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.342
Her mother
was so nasty to her

19:02.375 --> 19:04.311
we let Ella spend
her breaks with us.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.945
(Munch)
The summer after
that first year...

19:05.978 --> 19:07.714
you had to notice
she was pregnant.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.349
(woman)
She seemed a little heavier.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.484
We just chalked it up
to the Freshman 15.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.186
(Fin)
What about this time?

19:13.220 --> 19:15.322
We haven't seen her
in months.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.790
She said she was taking
a very heavy course load.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.726
Do you have any idea
who the father

19:19.759 --> 19:21.528
or fathers could be?

19:23.396 --> 19:24.631
I did everything I could

19:24.664 --> 19:26.266
to get her to tell me
the first time,

19:26.299 --> 19:28.835
but she said
she was too ashamed.

19:28.868 --> 19:32.639
She just...kept saying
she was sorry.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.741
Can you think of anyone that
she was especially close to?

19:34.774 --> 19:36.676
'04.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.311
It was an election year.

19:38.345 --> 19:41.348
She spent a lot of time
with Jerry Spencer.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.483
What does Jerry do?

19:43.516 --> 19:44.717
I was Everett's
campaign manager.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.919
I understand you worked
closely with Ella.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.755
She was our hardest-working
volunteer.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.857
What exactly did she do?

19:50.890 --> 19:53.260
We used her for
the "get out the youth" vote.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.694
She helped
her old man win.

19:54.727 --> 19:55.795
Without some serious
spin control,

19:55.828 --> 19:57.664
she's gonna
cost him the next one.

19:57.697 --> 19:58.731
Great-looking girl.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.800
I know,
and sweet as can be.

20:00.833 --> 20:03.236
I can't believe
she did what they're saying.

20:03.270 --> 20:04.837
(Fin)
She didn't
tell you about it?

20:04.871 --> 20:05.905
Why would she?

20:05.938 --> 20:07.840
Any chance you
fathered those babies?

20:07.874 --> 20:09.776
I'm a happily married man.

20:09.809 --> 20:10.843
So take a paternity test.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.445
No.
[cell phone rings]

20:12.479 --> 20:14.514
Doing that would be admitting
there's a possibility

20:14.547 --> 20:16.316
I slept with her,
and I didn't.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.685
(Fin)
Munch.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.620
Ella got discharged
from the hospital.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.855
We gotta pick her up
before arraignment.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.524
We'll give Ella your love.

20:28.528 --> 20:31.564
(man)
Ella, why did you
abandon your baby?

20:31.598 --> 20:34.267
[all shouting]

20:36.469 --> 20:37.670
(woman)
Look this way, Ella!

20:42.909 --> 20:45.645
You evil,
disgusting skank!

20:45.678 --> 20:47.847
Did murdering your first child
affect your life at all?

20:47.880 --> 20:48.948
(woman)
Sterilize her!

20:48.981 --> 20:50.350
Make it stop!

20:50.383 --> 20:52.852
[crying]

20:52.885 --> 20:54.487
What's gonna happen to it?

20:54.521 --> 20:55.288
Your baby?

20:55.322 --> 20:57.324
Well, thanks
to the media attention,

20:57.357 --> 20:58.791
ACS is getting
flooded with calls.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.660
His future's looking up.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.795
I'm sorry.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.063
You're only sorry
'cause you got caught.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.834
You got lying down
to a science, don't you?

21:07.867 --> 21:09.402
That one
about you being raped?

21:09.436 --> 21:10.403
That was a good one.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.339
You wouldn't understand.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.073
As soon as I lodge you
with Corrections,

21:14.106 --> 21:16.008
they're gonna take you
upstairs to arraignment.

21:16.042 --> 21:18.010
And that's the last time that
we're gonna be allowed to talk.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.379
Do you understand that?

21:19.412 --> 21:21.948
So I suggest you tell me
if the baby's father

21:21.981 --> 21:23.616
was involved
in this crime.

21:28.955 --> 21:29.989
Have it your way.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.924
[buzzer]

21:39.999 --> 21:42.402
He didn't know
I was pregnant.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.871
Ella, tell me his name.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.573
No, I'd never
drag him into this.

21:46.606 --> 21:49.542
Ella, I can see
that you care about him.

21:49.576 --> 21:50.810
But why isn't he
here for you?

21:50.843 --> 21:52.812
He's married.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.014
With a family.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.983
It'll ruin his life.

21:57.016 --> 21:57.884
I need to talk to him.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.019
Tell me who he is.
No.

22:00.052 --> 22:02.589
Never. I can't.

22:07.894 --> 22:10.763
(man)
Docket ending 23805.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.565
People versus
Ella Christensen.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.701
Attempted Murder
in the Second Degree,

22:14.734 --> 22:16.769
Endangerment of a Child,

22:16.803 --> 22:17.870
and Child Abandonment.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.372
How do you plead?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.008
Not guilty.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.976
I'll hear the People
on bail.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.945
Well, a million
has a nice ring to it.

22:25.978 --> 22:27.380
The defendant
is a flight risk.

22:27.414 --> 22:29.982
To where, Jersey?
She's a U.S. citizen.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.451
Given the severity
of her crimes,

22:31.484 --> 22:33.453
and the fact that she killed
a baby once before--

22:33.486 --> 22:35.688
My client was never
charged with that crime.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.790
In fact,
there was no crime.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.025
That fetus was stillborn.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.660
(judge)
Mr. Berger...

22:40.693 --> 22:43.029
(Berger)
Your honor, this poor girl
lost a child.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.665
How dare the People
twist that tragic incident

22:45.698 --> 22:46.966
to suit their own needs.

22:46.999 --> 22:49.502
You have got to be kidding.
No, you are.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.938
My client doesn't have
as much as a parking ticket!

22:51.971 --> 22:53.806
I'm sure if she did,
she'd just throw it in the trash

22:53.840 --> 22:55.608
along with her babies.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.910
(judge)
Oh, all right, that's
enough out of both of you.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.679
As I believe the defendant
is not a threat to anyone

22:59.712 --> 23:00.780
but her own offspring,

23:00.813 --> 23:02.582
the court
is requesting that,

23:02.615 --> 23:04.851
in exchange
for a lower bail amount,

23:04.884 --> 23:06.986
she does not get pregnant again
before trial.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.187
That's unconstitutional!

23:08.220 --> 23:09.856
I'm not ordering that she

23:09.889 --> 23:12.058
be sterilized,
Mr. Berger.

23:12.091 --> 23:14.093
But if you do become
pregnant again, young lady,

23:14.126 --> 23:17.997
you will be found
in contempt of this court.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.866
And bail will be rescinded.

23:19.899 --> 23:20.967
(Berger)
Your Honor has no right

23:21.000 --> 23:23.169
to legislate procreation.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.538
You think you could manage
to comply with that order,

23:25.572 --> 23:26.573
Ms. Christensen?

23:32.479 --> 23:34.981
I don't know.

23:35.948 --> 23:38.217
Bail is set at $2 million,
cash or bond.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.619
10 minute recess!

23:40.887 --> 23:43.623
Her affect was flat.
Almost dissociative.

23:43.656 --> 23:46.025
You think she's setting
the stage for a psych defense?

23:46.058 --> 23:47.960
Well, it'll be
hard going if she is.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.028
Because she's faking it.

23:49.061 --> 23:51.464
No, because DSM4
diagnostic standards

23:51.498 --> 23:54.100
still don't exist for postpartum
psychiatric illnesses.

23:54.133 --> 23:54.867
Here we go.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.903
Many courts
bar its admission.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.571
That's the reason why
infanticide sentences

23:58.605 --> 24:00.540
vary so wildly
in this country.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.208
Some women are given
the death penalty,

24:02.241 --> 24:04.043
and others are
given probation.

24:04.076 --> 24:05.945
You think postpartum depression
should excuse

24:05.978 --> 24:07.480
murdering your child?

24:07.514 --> 24:08.881
It's not depression.

24:08.915 --> 24:11.551
I think she's suffering
from postpartum psychosis.

24:11.584 --> 24:12.585
Giving birth
made her crazy.

24:12.619 --> 24:13.986
It's a hormonal imbalance

24:14.020 --> 24:15.054
stemming from pregnancy.

24:15.087 --> 24:17.089
Its onset can be
quick and severe.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.191
Its symptoms
include agitation,

24:19.225 --> 24:21.060
hallucinations,
delusions--

24:21.093 --> 24:23.062
The Andrea Yates defense.

24:23.095 --> 24:25.097
Look, the only thing
making this girl crazy

24:25.131 --> 24:25.898
is the baby's father.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.266
I don't know
what part he played,

24:27.299 --> 24:29.201
but I know
that he's involved.

24:29.235 --> 24:30.269
Liv, that was Warner.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.204
She wants you
to stop by the lab.

24:32.238 --> 24:34.574
The results of the maternity
test are in.

24:34.607 --> 24:35.942
No big surprise there.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.844
I was pretty surprised.

24:37.877 --> 24:40.880
Ella has to be
the mother, right?

24:40.913 --> 24:41.981
The DNA on the left
is Ella's.

24:42.014 --> 24:43.816
Her baby boy's
is on the right.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.918
He's definitely her son.

24:45.952 --> 24:47.119
You had me scared
for a second.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.988
He's too much her son.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.056
What does that mean?

24:50.089 --> 24:52.725
We get half
our chromosomes

24:52.759 --> 24:55.094
from our mother
and half from our father.

24:55.127 --> 24:55.895
Based on this result,

24:55.928 --> 24:58.130
I expanded
the testing panel

24:58.164 --> 24:59.265
to 25 markers.

24:59.298 --> 25:00.700
Compared the alleles
of the mother

25:00.733 --> 25:02.201
to the offspring's.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.070
See all the overlaps?

25:04.103 --> 25:07.607
This baby and his mother
have the same father.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.179
He's a product of incest.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.116
Yes?

25:17.149 --> 25:18.184
Mrs. Drake,
is your husband home?

25:18.217 --> 25:20.553
Well, he asked
not to be disturbed.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.889
Is there anything
I can help you with?

25:22.922 --> 25:23.923
Well, maybe there is.

25:23.956 --> 25:25.124
What do you know about

25:25.157 --> 25:26.793
your husband's
relationship with Ella?

25:26.826 --> 25:31.030
Well, he obviously
loves her very much.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.699
I just co-signed
the papers

25:32.732 --> 25:34.166
putting up our house
as collateral.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.301
For what?

25:35.334 --> 25:36.603
Bail.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.172
Where's Ella now?

25:40.206 --> 25:41.841
She's inside
with her father.

25:43.242 --> 25:45.011
Excuse me.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.181
What are you doing?

25:49.215 --> 25:50.316
Who are you?

25:50.349 --> 25:51.317
She just
barged right in.

25:51.350 --> 25:52.885
Your daughter
knows who I am.

25:52.919 --> 25:54.787
I don't think it's appropriate
for you to be here.

25:54.821 --> 25:55.855
Well, I don't think
you're fit

25:55.888 --> 25:57.724
to talk about
what's appropriate.

25:57.757 --> 25:58.958
Excuse me?

25:58.991 --> 26:00.627
I'm sorry to be rude,
Mrs. Drake.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.862
I just got a little upset
when I saw your husband

26:02.895 --> 26:04.096
working on
a third baby to kill.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.098
Did you tell your wife
that her grandson

26:06.132 --> 26:07.266
is also her stepson?

26:09.401 --> 26:11.671
What?

26:11.704 --> 26:13.272
Your husband's been
cheating on you.

26:14.841 --> 26:17.844
With his own daughter.

26:27.386 --> 26:31.057
How did it start, Ella?

26:31.090 --> 26:33.893
Do you have any idea
what it's like

26:33.926 --> 26:37.864
to wonder who your father is
your whole life?

26:39.932 --> 26:41.133
What do you mean?

26:41.167 --> 26:42.935
I mean...

26:42.969 --> 26:45.271
What does he look like?

26:45.304 --> 26:48.908
What does he do?

26:48.941 --> 26:52.078
Does he ever think about me
on my birthday?

26:52.111 --> 26:54.947
On Christmas?

26:54.981 --> 26:58.885
Ever?

26:58.918 --> 27:01.353
I mean...

27:01.387 --> 27:03.389
I never even
knew his name.

27:06.793 --> 27:09.428
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

27:09.461 --> 27:11.731
Yes.

27:11.764 --> 27:12.732
My mother could not

27:12.765 --> 27:14.133
stand the sound
of my laugh.

27:14.166 --> 27:16.135
She said
it was just like his, and...

27:16.168 --> 27:18.871
I mean, she always
ignored me.

27:18.905 --> 27:21.674
But if I asked about him,

27:21.708 --> 27:23.943
then she wouldn't even
talk to me for days.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.846
She'd...

27:26.879 --> 27:30.049
She took what he did to her
out on you.

27:30.082 --> 27:32.819
He didn't do anything to her.
She just didn't want him.

27:32.852 --> 27:35.688
She didn't want him
like she didn't want me.

27:41.828 --> 27:43.863
Ella...

27:43.896 --> 27:46.933
I'm sure
that that's not true.

27:46.966 --> 27:49.769
I knew she'd never love me.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.237
Just like I knew
he always would.

27:51.270 --> 27:55.341
You had never met him.

27:55.374 --> 27:58.177
You idealized him.

27:58.210 --> 28:01.848
How did you find him?

28:01.881 --> 28:03.783
I found a copy
of my birth certificate

28:03.816 --> 28:06.218
just before I left
for college, and...

28:06.252 --> 28:09.922
It had my original
last name on it.

28:09.956 --> 28:11.290
And my birthplace.

28:11.323 --> 28:12.959
Newark?

28:14.794 --> 28:17.830
It was easy enough
to track him down from there.

28:20.933 --> 28:23.469
We fell in love
at first sight.

28:26.906 --> 28:29.175
[door opens]

28:30.843 --> 28:33.846
Ella was just telling me
how you two lovebirds met.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.181
[sighs]

28:35.214 --> 28:37.316
Showed up at my office...

28:37.349 --> 28:39.285
pretending to be
one of my constituents.

28:39.318 --> 28:41.187
Oh, so she tricked you.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.189
She didn't tell me
she was my daughter.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.091
Well, how did you
figure it out?

28:46.859 --> 28:48.995
Was it the first time
you had sex with her?

28:52.364 --> 28:53.766
Before.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.134
You're a sick man,
Mr. Drake.

28:55.167 --> 28:56.302
We couldn't help it!

28:56.335 --> 28:58.037
She's your daughter!

28:58.070 --> 28:59.872
I saw her as a woman,
not as my child.

28:59.906 --> 29:01.040
You took advantage
of a young girl's

29:01.073 --> 29:02.541
desperate need
for her father's love.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.709
You think
I'm proud of this?!

29:03.742 --> 29:06.045
You think this is something
that I wanted to have happen?

29:06.078 --> 29:07.513
My life is ruined!

29:07.546 --> 29:08.881
Well, it wouldn't have been
if you'd succeeded

29:08.915 --> 29:10.783
in getting rid
of baby number two.

29:10.817 --> 29:12.451
I wish to God
Ella had told me about him.

29:12.484 --> 29:13.953
I would never
have let her do it.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.221
You can't
still be claiming

29:15.254 --> 29:16.856
that you didn't know
she was pregnant.

29:16.889 --> 29:17.857
I didn't.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.058
Wow!

29:19.091 --> 29:22.528
Denial really does
run in your family.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.964
I love her.

29:24.997 --> 29:27.099
If I had known,
I would have taken care of it.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.935
Legally.
If you loved her,

29:28.968 --> 29:31.904
you wouldn't let her go down
for a crime that you committed.

29:31.938 --> 29:33.172
I'm a public figure.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.174
I can name at least a dozen
people who saw me that morning.

29:35.207 --> 29:37.476
There's no way I could have been
in the city to dump that baby.

29:37.509 --> 29:38.911
I'll be
checking on that.
Do!

29:38.945 --> 29:40.980
In the meantime,
I need to see my daughter.

29:41.013 --> 29:42.448
Yeah, like I'm gonna
let that happen.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.016
I know you will.

29:44.050 --> 29:46.185
I still have a license
to practice law.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.493
(Benson)
Arrest him for the incest.

29:54.526 --> 29:56.863
Even if Jersey weren't
outside our jurisdiction,

29:56.896 --> 29:58.130
it's a hard case to make.

29:58.164 --> 29:59.932
Take a picture!
That's your case.

29:59.966 --> 30:01.901
It was consensual sex
between adults.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.903
Adult incest
isn't a crime?

30:03.936 --> 30:04.937
Not a sex crime.

30:04.971 --> 30:06.038
Under New York penal code

30:06.072 --> 30:07.573
it's listed
right next to adultery

30:07.606 --> 30:09.976
as an offense affecting
the marital relationship.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.443
That's insane.
It's an E-Felony.

30:11.477 --> 30:12.511
He'd get probation.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.480
He should rot in jail.

30:14.513 --> 30:15.882
They'd have
to try Ella as well.

30:15.915 --> 30:17.249
She committed the same crime.

30:17.283 --> 30:18.550
So get him
on attempted murder.

30:18.584 --> 30:20.586
I know that he's
involved in this.

30:20.619 --> 30:21.921
He has a solid alibi.

30:21.954 --> 30:23.355
We can't make him
legally culpable

30:23.389 --> 30:24.957
just because
we want him to be.

30:24.991 --> 30:27.093
So Ella gets put away
for attempted murder,

30:27.126 --> 30:28.060
and he gets off scot-free?

30:32.298 --> 30:33.900
Look at them.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.107
I assume Berger
will be launching

30:41.140 --> 30:43.075
an aggressive psych defense.

30:45.611 --> 30:50.116
(Berger)
Dr. Wong, as a consulting
forensic psychiatrist,

30:50.149 --> 30:52.985
you were called in
by Manhattan SVU

30:53.019 --> 30:54.253
to observe the defendant.

30:54.286 --> 30:55.454
I was.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.089
And what assessment
did you give them

30:57.123 --> 30:58.257
of a mental state?

30:58.290 --> 31:00.993
That she might be suffering
from postpartum psychosis.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.895
I see.
That she was insane.

31:02.929 --> 31:04.263
(Novak)
Objection.

31:04.296 --> 31:05.097
A diagnosis

31:05.131 --> 31:07.099
of psychosis
does not imply insanity

31:07.133 --> 31:08.134
under U.S. law.

31:08.167 --> 31:09.635
Sustained.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.570
Are you familiar

31:11.603 --> 31:13.072
with Kendall's study

31:13.105 --> 31:15.908
of postpartum women,
which showed,

31:15.942 --> 31:18.077
"Psychiatric
hospital admissions

31:18.110 --> 31:21.447
"increase seven times

31:21.480 --> 31:23.182
"in the first three
postpartum months

31:23.215 --> 31:24.984
"compared to pre-pregnancy

31:25.017 --> 31:27.053
"and represent
the peak prevalence

31:27.086 --> 31:29.055
for psychiatric disorders
for women."

31:29.088 --> 31:30.122
I'm aware of

31:30.156 --> 31:31.523
the biologically
vulnerable state

31:31.557 --> 31:33.692
of the women
following childbirth.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.295
So their brain chemistry
can be altered?

31:36.328 --> 31:38.264
Their hormones go crazy.
Uh, sorry.

31:38.297 --> 31:41.000
I'm gonna anticipate
an objection to that one.

31:41.033 --> 31:42.201
Let me rephrase.

31:43.435 --> 31:47.906
Their hormones...
go kooky.

31:50.977 --> 31:52.544
I couldn't comprehend
what had just...

31:52.578 --> 31:55.047
come out of me.

31:55.081 --> 31:57.116
(Berger)
You're a bright girl, Ella.

31:57.149 --> 31:59.185
Manhattan Institute
of Technology.

31:59.218 --> 32:01.620
Engineering major.
Dean's list.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.122
Yes.

32:03.155 --> 32:06.192
And yet you didn't
recognize a baby?

32:06.225 --> 32:07.559
No.

32:09.728 --> 32:12.464
Well, how--
how is that possible?

32:14.333 --> 32:16.702
It looked...

32:16.735 --> 32:19.972
mutated to me.

32:20.006 --> 32:21.540
Uh, deformed.

32:23.675 --> 32:26.445
I didn't know what it was.

32:26.478 --> 32:30.249
But I knew it couldn't
possibly survive.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.618
(Berger)
What did you do with it, Ella?

32:32.651 --> 32:35.021
I put it in...

32:35.054 --> 32:38.524
a cardboard box.

32:38.557 --> 32:40.092
And then...

32:40.126 --> 32:44.963
I put that
in the garbage bag.

32:47.199 --> 32:48.534
No further questions.

32:51.103 --> 32:53.572
What else did you put
in the bag, Ella?

32:53.605 --> 32:55.207
Nothing.

32:55.241 --> 32:57.109
Nothing?

32:59.145 --> 33:01.647
People's Exhibit "C."

33:01.680 --> 33:02.714
The sheets on which

33:02.748 --> 33:04.283
the defendant gave birth.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.617
I don't remember
doing that.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.219
They were further evidence
of your crime.

33:07.253 --> 33:09.188
You had to get rid of them, too,
didn't you?

33:09.221 --> 33:10.522
I don't remember.

33:10.556 --> 33:12.591
Along with old clothes
to muffle

33:12.624 --> 33:14.326
her baby's cries.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.494
(Ella)
I don't remember.

33:15.527 --> 33:18.297
What do you remember, Ella?

33:20.366 --> 33:23.435
Being outside.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.171
Walking.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.505
To throw away your baby,

33:26.538 --> 33:28.740
as far away as possible,
to cover up your crime.

33:28.774 --> 33:31.043
No.

33:31.077 --> 33:34.213
I didn't even know I had
anything in my hand.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.715
Until it started
to feel heavy.

33:38.117 --> 33:40.519
And then...
I looked down,

33:40.552 --> 33:42.521
and I saw
it was a garbage bag.

33:42.554 --> 33:43.822
What did you do then?

33:43.855 --> 33:45.124
[crying]

33:45.157 --> 33:48.527
I sat it on
a pile of trash.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.830
And...turned around.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.233
And went to class.

33:54.266 --> 33:57.269
Did you tell anyone
about what you had done?

33:57.303 --> 33:58.770
No.

33:58.804 --> 34:01.207
Not even the baby's father?

34:02.308 --> 34:03.609
No.

34:06.245 --> 34:08.347
(Berger)
Are you and your daughter
close, Mr. Drake?

34:08.380 --> 34:11.150
As close as two people
can be.

34:11.183 --> 34:13.219
Expand on that
for the court, please.

34:13.252 --> 34:16.222
For the past
two-and-a-half years,

34:16.255 --> 34:20.726
my daughter Ella and I
have engaged

34:20.759 --> 34:22.728
in a sexual relationship.

34:22.761 --> 34:26.265
[murmuring in courtroom]

34:26.298 --> 34:29.768
And this started
when Ella was 18, right?

34:29.801 --> 34:31.237
That's correct.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.871
Was the sex between you
consensual?

34:32.904 --> 34:36.508
I coerced Ella
into the relationship.

34:36.542 --> 34:40.779
She...begged me
100 times

34:40.812 --> 34:43.449
to end it.

34:43.482 --> 34:44.550
I'm sorry.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.218
I couldn't.

34:55.294 --> 34:58.664
"I told her 100 times
that we had to end it.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.332
Neither of us could."

35:00.366 --> 35:01.367
Are those your words,
Mr. Drake?

35:01.400 --> 35:03.535
I drove Ella crazy.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.137
Because you seem to be
contradicting yourself

35:05.171 --> 35:06.372
if they are.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.507
My actions drove her
to what she did.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.642
(Novak)
Answer the question, Mr. Drake.

35:10.676 --> 35:11.877
It's all my fault.

35:11.910 --> 35:12.911
"I wish to God...

35:12.944 --> 35:14.880
"Ella had told me
about him.

35:14.913 --> 35:16.782
I never would have
let her do it."

35:16.815 --> 35:18.484
You can't punish Ella
for my sins.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.286
Your words or not?

35:20.319 --> 35:23.155
Bear in mind that you're
under oath, Mr. Drake.

35:23.189 --> 35:25.924
Did you or did you not
tell Detective Benson

35:25.957 --> 35:27.793
that your relationship
with Ella

35:27.826 --> 35:29.395
was completely consensual?

35:29.428 --> 35:31.763
I was facing
criminal charges.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.632
And lied to cover my ass.

35:33.665 --> 35:36.768
And now you're lying
to cover Ella's.

35:59.625 --> 36:01.393
Have you reached a verdict?

36:01.427 --> 36:02.894
(woman)
We have.

36:02.928 --> 36:04.630
On the first count
of Child Abandonment,

36:04.663 --> 36:05.931
how do you find?

36:05.964 --> 36:08.267
We, the jury,
find the defendant...

36:08.300 --> 36:09.235
not guilty

36:09.268 --> 36:11.737
by reason of mental disease
or defect.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.305
(judge)
And on count two,

36:13.339 --> 36:14.973
Attempted Murder
in the Second Degree,

36:15.006 --> 36:16.342
how do you find?

36:16.375 --> 36:17.309
(forewoman)
Not guilty...

36:17.343 --> 36:19.345
by reason of mental disease
or defect.

36:19.378 --> 36:20.612
(judge)
Jury is dismissed.

36:20.646 --> 36:22.281
Defendant is to be remanded

36:22.314 --> 36:23.715
to the state psychiatric
hospital

36:23.749 --> 36:25.917
until such a time as she
is no longer a threat

36:25.951 --> 36:27.819
to herself or to others.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.321
Court is adjourned.

36:29.355 --> 36:31.457
[bangs gavel]

36:40.866 --> 36:44.002
Jury nullification.
Plain and simple.

36:44.035 --> 36:47.306
(Benson)
I think she had to be crazy,
don't you?

36:47.339 --> 36:49.475
She did what Everett
told her to do.

36:49.508 --> 36:50.876
I don't know.

36:50.909 --> 36:52.478
But I bet she'll have
the hospital convinced

36:52.511 --> 36:54.413
she's cured
in no time at all.

36:56.482 --> 36:58.284
Then back to daddy.

37:25.444 --> 37:28.380
Your father was involved
somehow, wasn't he?

37:29.781 --> 37:31.650
No.

37:31.683 --> 37:34.520
Ella, the trial
is over.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.388
Double jeopardy is in play.

37:36.422 --> 37:38.424
No matter what
you tell me now,

37:38.457 --> 37:42.928
you cannot be retried
for attempted murder charges.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.465
Do you understand that?

37:54.840 --> 37:57.676
You know, I never knew
my father either.

37:59.010 --> 38:00.479
What?

38:01.713 --> 38:04.883
I have no idea
who he is.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.585
To this day.

38:08.854 --> 38:12.458
My mother never
told me about him until...

38:12.491 --> 38:15.927
until after I grew up.

38:15.961 --> 38:19.598
Why not?

38:25.471 --> 38:28.674
I'm the product
of my mother's rape.

38:28.707 --> 38:31.510
Oh, my God.

38:31.543 --> 38:32.811
So I think
that I understand

38:32.844 --> 38:34.780
what you went through
growing up.

38:37.716 --> 38:40.085
I could never understand
my mother's inability

38:40.118 --> 38:41.052
to love me.

38:43.855 --> 38:46.692
Until after I learned
the truth about myself.

38:49.528 --> 38:51.563
Why are you
telling me this?

38:51.597 --> 38:53.999
Because I understand...

38:54.032 --> 38:56.602
the desire to get rid
of the constant reminder

38:56.635 --> 38:59.571
of your own rape.

38:59.605 --> 39:01.006
That's what I was
to my own mother.

39:01.039 --> 39:03.409
I'm sorry.

39:03.442 --> 39:06.512
That's what happened
to you, isn't it?

39:08.614 --> 39:09.748
You just couldn't face it.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.517
I wasn't raped.

39:11.550 --> 39:12.684
Yes, you were.

39:12.718 --> 39:13.619
No.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.554
Did your father tell you
to get rid of them?

39:15.587 --> 39:16.855
Everett had nothing
to do with it.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.089
He never even
knew about it.

39:18.123 --> 39:19.825
He had to.
He had to have helped you!

39:19.858 --> 39:23.028
No, he didn't!
I got rid of them myself!

39:26.565 --> 39:29.000
I just thought
if I just ignored them,

39:29.034 --> 39:33.071
they'd just...
go away, and...

39:33.104 --> 39:36.442
And, like,
it never happened.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.544
But then once they were born,
I couldn't ignore them,

39:38.577 --> 39:40.412
because they just kept
screaming and crying

39:40.446 --> 39:41.980
and screaming,
and they were...

39:50.456 --> 39:52.691
That's why I threw them away.

39:55.026 --> 39:58.497
And then they really didn't
exist anymore.

40:06.638 --> 40:09.174
And I was right
all along.

40:15.547 --> 40:18.550
Your first baby
wasn't stillborn.

40:22.554 --> 40:24.122
Uh-uh.

40:31.763 --> 40:35.534
Charges were never filed
on your first baby's death.

40:37.235 --> 40:40.939
I'm gonna have to tell
the Newark DA's office.

40:44.543 --> 40:45.877
Tell them what?

40:53.251 --> 40:54.119
(Benson)
Will they charge her
with murder?

40:54.152 --> 40:56.154
Not while she's in
psychiatric lockup.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.355
After she's released?
Oh, they might.

40:57.388 --> 40:59.224
But I bet they'll come up
with the same verdict in Jersey

40:59.257 --> 41:00.091
that they did here.

41:00.125 --> 41:02.193
Place her right back
in that hospital.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.133
He's beautiful.

41:08.166 --> 41:10.035
Just had his checkup.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.603
No chromosomal
abnormalities.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.805
(Everett)
Hmm, you hear that?

41:13.839 --> 41:15.206
You're invincible.

41:17.242 --> 41:20.278
Hand me that baby.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.013
He's my son.

41:22.047 --> 41:23.582
I'm taking custody.

41:23.615 --> 41:24.516
That's never
gonna happen.

41:24.550 --> 41:26.685
We were just finishing up
the paperwork.

41:26.718 --> 41:28.086
We just came to serve you

41:28.119 --> 41:29.655
with an injunction
barring Mr. Drake

41:29.688 --> 41:31.657
from having any contact
with the infant.

41:31.690 --> 41:33.592
I can give him a home.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.226
And love.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.762
He belongs
with his father.

41:36.795 --> 41:38.163
But not with his grandfather.

41:38.196 --> 41:40.265
Hand the baby
to Detective Benson

41:40.298 --> 41:42.267
or you will be
placed under arrest.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.505
Hand him to me.

41:50.976 --> 41:52.844
Now.

42:02.253 --> 42:04.289
You're never
getting this baby.

42:07.225 --> 42:08.960
We'll see.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.870
It's gonna be okay.

42:21.306 --> 42:24.242
You're gonna be okay.
