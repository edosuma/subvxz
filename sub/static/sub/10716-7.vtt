Uniformed personnel.
Order! Arms!

03:58.767 --> 04:01.703
Honor guard.
Forward! Arms!

04:02.704 --> 04:05.206
Half right face!

04:05.273 --> 04:07.375
Ready. Aim. Fire!

04:08.677 --> 04:10.044
Aim. Fire!

04:11.545 --> 04:12.681
Aim. Fire!

04:14.415 --> 04:16.751
Honor guard.
Atten-huh!

04:16.818 --> 04:19.153
Half left face!

05:11.439 --> 05:12.807
In memory of your son,

05:12.874 --> 05:15.977
and on behalf of
a grateful city,

05:16.044 --> 05:18.747
and the Los Angeles
Police Department.

05:26.955 --> 05:31.359
Honor guard.

Uniformed personnel.
Present arms!

**

06:08.362 --> 06:10.098
Thank you for coming,
lieutenant.

06:10.164 --> 06:13.334
Listen,
just give me a call if
there's anything I can do.

06:22.343 --> 06:23.311
I'll see you later.

06:27.115 --> 06:28.249
Arceneaux.

06:29.951 --> 06:31.419
Sir, I'm very sorry
about your loss.

06:31.485 --> 06:33.421
And yours.

06:33.487 --> 06:34.956
Sir?

06:35.023 --> 06:36.657
He was your partner
and your friend.

06:36.724 --> 06:38.259
He was.
Thank you.

06:42.630 --> 06:44.999
Tell me what happened
that night.

06:47.001 --> 06:49.838
What the fuck happened
that night?

06:50.905 --> 06:53.908
Sir, I was told
not to talk to you

06:53.975 --> 06:55.143
or anyone else about it.

06:55.209 --> 06:57.946
- You're IOD.
- Yes, sir.

06:58.012 --> 06:59.848
Injured on duty.

06:59.881 --> 07:01.515
The shock of it, sir.

07:01.582 --> 07:04.518
I guess we're all IOD.

07:04.585 --> 07:06.120
Tell you somethin',
though.

07:08.589 --> 07:10.859
Sir.

07:10.859 --> 07:13.761
You can't hide behind
this bullshit forever.

07:13.862 --> 07:17.866
Sooner or later
you are going to tell me
what happened to my son.

10:15.043 --> 10:18.079
GPS data for
Tony Allen's car.

10:18.146 --> 10:19.247
You look at the night
he was killed?

10:19.313 --> 10:21.715
GPS shows
location coordinates, right?

10:21.782 --> 10:24.718
Also creates a marker
every time the engine's
turned on and off.

10:24.785 --> 10:26.254
Okay.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.323
That night,
he stopped for two minutes
up on Mulholland,

10:29.390 --> 10:31.992
a mile and a half
from where the car
and body were found,

10:32.060 --> 10:33.327
three from his house.

10:33.394 --> 10:34.928
Time syncs with
his last phone call.

10:34.995 --> 10:37.131
- The one with
Layla in Vegas.
- Correct.

10:37.198 --> 10:38.266
We have
the murder scene.

10:38.332 --> 10:40.234
That's what I'm thinking.

10:40.301 --> 10:42.370
On his way home
talkin' to his girlfriend.

10:42.436 --> 10:44.938
He sees something.
Hey, baby, gotta go.

10:45.005 --> 10:47.941
Hangs up, pulls over,
gets out. Pop, pop.

10:48.008 --> 10:49.510
Two in the back
of the head.

10:49.577 --> 10:50.944
I'm thinkin' we should
go up there

10:51.011 --> 10:52.513
first thing tomorrow,
take a look.

10:53.847 --> 10:55.516
How far back
did that go?

10:55.583 --> 10:57.251
Beginning of the lease.
Three years.

10:57.318 --> 10:58.286
Mind if I take a look?

10:58.352 --> 10:59.620
Yeah,
knock yourself out.

11:07.095 --> 11:08.962
Mrs. Allen.

11:09.097 --> 11:10.731
Top of the mornin'
to you.

11:10.798 --> 11:12.500
Mr. Nash.

11:17.638 --> 11:18.806
My lawyer called.

11:18.872 --> 11:21.275
Should be on
the probate docket
any day.

11:21.342 --> 11:23.977
- When, exactly?
- Soon.

11:24.112 --> 11:25.713
Just be patient.

11:25.779 --> 11:27.948
Patience is
my middle name.

11:28.015 --> 11:29.983
Hmm.

11:30.118 --> 11:31.119
I miss you.

11:31.152 --> 11:33.387
It's too risky.

11:33.454 --> 11:35.723
We gotta act like they're
watching everything we do.

11:37.125 --> 11:38.226
Are they?

11:38.292 --> 11:40.628
If they're not,
they will be.

11:42.963 --> 11:45.032
Patience is not
my middle name.

11:45.133 --> 11:47.435
Don't I know that.

11:50.671 --> 11:52.206
Have a wonderful day,
ma'am.

11:52.273 --> 11:54.142
And you, officer.

13:07.715 --> 13:11.051
Irv.
I thought I heard
someone come in.

13:11.118 --> 13:13.687
Greg.

13:13.754 --> 13:14.855
Connie in the kitchen?

13:14.922 --> 13:16.657
No, she's upstairs
resting.

13:16.724 --> 13:18.859
- How is she?
- Better.

13:18.926 --> 13:20.228
Better?

13:20.294 --> 13:21.695
We thought she was having
a panic attack earlier.

13:21.762 --> 13:24.898
Couldn't catch her breath,
hands were trembling,

13:24.965 --> 13:26.066
said her heart
was pounding.

13:26.133 --> 13:27.668
Why didn't anyone
call me?

13:29.837 --> 13:30.938
She asked me not to.

13:34.242 --> 13:35.343
Is she okay now?

13:35.409 --> 13:37.511
She took something,
calmed her down.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.314
What brings you here?

13:40.381 --> 13:42.350
To my own house?

13:42.416 --> 13:43.617
You know what I mean.

13:43.684 --> 13:45.953
I just came by to
grab some things.

13:46.019 --> 13:47.421
Fresh clothes.

13:49.257 --> 13:51.091
Let me get you
what you need.

13:51.158 --> 13:52.460
Come on.

13:52.526 --> 13:54.395
I'll be in and out,
I won't disturb her.

13:56.330 --> 13:59.900
She doesn't want to
see you, Irv.

13:59.967 --> 14:01.969
She was very clear
about that.

14:08.576 --> 14:10.844
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad.

14:10.911 --> 14:12.045
You gonna come with?

14:12.112 --> 14:13.281
Uh, kimchi's
not my thing.

14:13.347 --> 14:14.582
Just try it,
Mom.

14:14.648 --> 14:16.650
Look, I did. Once.
I'll never do it again.

14:16.717 --> 14:18.486
I blew my nose
the entire dinner.

14:18.552 --> 14:22.055
It is not my idea of an
elegant dining experience.

14:22.122 --> 14:22.956
Your loss.

14:23.023 --> 14:24.525
Give us a minute, Mads.

14:24.592 --> 14:26.760
Whatever. I have to go to
the bathroom, anyway.

14:26.827 --> 14:28.929
Meet you in
the break room.

14:28.996 --> 14:30.364
Follow me.

14:33.834 --> 14:35.569
So, what's goin' on?

14:35.636 --> 14:38.306
Don't get your hopes up.
Could just be a hunch.

14:38.372 --> 14:40.774
Undercover FBI agent in
the Marks organization

14:40.841 --> 14:42.876
disappeared two years ago,
Christmas Eve.

14:42.943 --> 14:45.479
They assume
Marks had him killed,
buried in the desert,

14:45.546 --> 14:46.947
but they've no idea where.

14:47.014 --> 14:48.849
Okay.

14:48.916 --> 14:51.985
We also found
traces of old blood in
the trunk of Allen's car.

14:52.052 --> 14:54.955
- The agent's?
- Maybe. They're
working the DNA.

14:55.022 --> 14:58.626
But today, we got
the GPS data from that car

14:58.692 --> 15:00.461
going back
almost three years.

15:00.528 --> 15:02.830
You think the GPS indicates
where the body's buried?

15:02.896 --> 15:04.698
Mm, that's my hunch.

15:04.765 --> 15:06.334
Tony Allen was just
a money launderer.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.668
I don't see him as
the hitter.

15:07.735 --> 15:09.537
Maybe just
the clean up guy?

15:09.603 --> 15:13.173
Marks' cousin,
someone he could trust to
get rid of a dead body.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.242
Mr. Wolf.

15:15.343 --> 15:16.677
Who?

15:16.744 --> 15:18.612
Harvey Keitel.

15:18.679 --> 15:20.348
"Pulp Fiction."
The clean up guy.

15:20.348 --> 15:21.849
You know I don't go
to the movies.

15:21.915 --> 15:23.884
At least you know
it is a movie.

15:23.951 --> 15:25.353
That's something.

15:25.386 --> 15:26.920
Of course I know
it's a movie.

15:26.987 --> 15:30.491
Anyway, tell Griffin about
the blood in the car.

15:30.558 --> 15:32.760
Give him the GPS data,
let the Feds figure it out.

15:32.826 --> 15:35.195
Even if it doesn't pan out,
you've made the effort.

15:35.262 --> 15:36.263
Could be helpful.

15:36.364 --> 15:37.831
Hope so.

15:37.898 --> 15:39.667
You hope so what?

15:39.733 --> 15:41.435
That the traffic
isn't too bad.
You ready?

15:41.502 --> 15:43.371
It's kind of early
to eat, isn't it?

15:43.437 --> 15:46.073
Oh, it's rush hour.
By the time we get there,
it won't be.

15:46.139 --> 15:48.208
You'll be starving,
screaming.

15:48.275 --> 15:50.077
Have fun, you two.

15:50.143 --> 15:51.812
- Bye, Mom.
- See you.

16:05.058 --> 16:06.159
Chief.

16:06.226 --> 16:07.595
I need to talk to you.

16:07.661 --> 16:10.798
Omni Hotel,
suite 1530.

16:12.900 --> 16:14.635
I'm about to have dinner
with my daughter.

16:14.702 --> 16:17.405
I can meet up with you
afterwards.

16:17.405 --> 16:19.306
Of course.

16:19.407 --> 16:20.874
Have a nice dinner.

16:20.941 --> 16:22.876
Thank you, sir.

16:22.943 --> 16:24.077
You have to go to work?

16:24.144 --> 16:25.413
Not before we eat.

16:31.619 --> 16:33.020
It's open.

16:47.134 --> 16:50.738
My son was
working undercover
for Internal Affairs.

16:50.804 --> 16:53.441
Special Operations
Division.

16:53.507 --> 16:55.142
I had no idea.

16:55.208 --> 16:56.444
No one did.

16:58.946 --> 17:00.648
He was part of a team
putting together a case

17:00.714 --> 17:04.117
against a crew of corrupt
vice and narcotics officers.

17:04.184 --> 17:07.020
They'd been
ripping off drug dealers,
shaking down merchants.

17:08.589 --> 17:10.824
And all of this?

17:10.891 --> 17:13.661
At the moment,
the RHD investigation
into my son's death

17:13.727 --> 17:16.630
is focused on possible
gang retaliation.

17:16.697 --> 17:19.199
Or that George
did stumble into
an armed robbery,

17:19.266 --> 17:21.802
and his death
had nothing to do with
his undercover work.

17:23.336 --> 17:25.473
Those both
seem plausible.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.611
No, he was found out.

17:30.678 --> 17:33.313
And they murdered him.

17:33.380 --> 17:35.883
Sir, I know one of
the leads, Brad Coniff.

17:35.949 --> 17:38.051
He's as good as it comes
at his job.

17:38.118 --> 17:40.287
I'm sure he is.

17:40.353 --> 17:41.889
When he's
allowed to do it.

17:45.125 --> 17:48.061
But it's
campaign season, Bosch.

17:48.128 --> 17:50.564
Dirty cops killing
a fellow officer.

17:52.032 --> 17:53.834
Are you saying
they'd cover this up?

17:53.901 --> 17:56.804
The mayor and
his police chief?

17:56.870 --> 17:58.606
They'll do whatever they can
to impede this investigation

17:58.672 --> 18:00.140
until after the election.

18:00.207 --> 18:02.375
And then they'll make sure
it goes away quietly.

18:02.510 --> 18:03.744
They'll cut deals with
the guilty ones,

18:03.811 --> 18:06.179
no trials,
no headlines.

18:06.246 --> 18:08.315
No blow back.

18:08.381 --> 18:10.183
And no way to ever
find out the truth.

18:11.885 --> 18:14.087
Well, then, as much as it
might make them uncomfortable,

18:14.154 --> 18:17.090
there's no way they're gonna
gut RHD's investigation.

18:17.157 --> 18:18.992
I would in their position.

18:21.228 --> 18:22.195
Done worse.

18:33.541 --> 18:35.275
Chief, why am I here?

18:35.342 --> 18:36.977
I want you to
work the case.

18:37.044 --> 18:38.311
With RHD?

18:38.378 --> 18:39.980
With me.

18:41.281 --> 18:42.850
I need you, Bosch.

18:42.916 --> 18:45.018
I need a detective
who will be relentless

18:45.085 --> 18:45.886
on behalf of my son.

18:45.953 --> 18:48.856
- Look, sir--
- Arceneaux.

18:48.922 --> 18:51.291
And right now
he's untouchable.

18:51.358 --> 18:52.960
And he knows
who's behind this.

18:53.026 --> 18:56.063
And RHD can't even
talk to him.

18:56.129 --> 18:57.097
But you can.

18:59.933 --> 19:02.670
Ah, shit, sir.
Parallel investigation.

19:02.736 --> 19:04.137
That's not a good idea.

19:04.204 --> 19:06.339
Let RHD do their job.

19:06.406 --> 19:07.741
They'll find
your son's killer.

19:07.808 --> 19:09.877
If they'd let them.

19:09.943 --> 19:11.344
Who's they?

19:11.411 --> 19:13.246
The tenth floor.

19:19.252 --> 19:22.055
At my son's funeral,

19:22.122 --> 19:24.858
you picked up a shell casing
from the honor guard.

19:26.459 --> 19:29.262
Well, that's something I always
do at an officer's funeral.

19:29.329 --> 19:30.598
Why?

19:33.300 --> 19:35.736
Because he was one of us.

19:36.637 --> 19:39.339
Then help me.

19:39.406 --> 19:41.108
Help me find out
who killed him.

20:10.403 --> 20:11.705
J. Edgar.

20:11.772 --> 20:13.173
We heading up to
Mulholland

20:13.240 --> 20:14.241
before it gets to hot?

20:14.307 --> 20:16.009
Oh, shit.
I forgot.

20:16.076 --> 20:18.111
I'm Downtown.
Something came up.

20:18.178 --> 20:20.513
Do me a solid and
handle Mulholland
on your own.

20:20.580 --> 20:22.315
I'll make it up to you.

20:22.382 --> 20:23.416
Sure, Harry.

20:23.483 --> 20:24.652
Thanks, partner.

20:29.189 --> 20:31.024
Finney's doing
more than okay.

20:31.091 --> 20:32.960
Dropped the
military pension,

20:33.026 --> 20:34.127
and now he's
running security

20:34.194 --> 20:36.029
for some hedge fund baby
out in Malibu.

20:36.096 --> 20:37.597
Yeah, shit,
if I was Finney

20:37.665 --> 20:39.199
I'd be golfing
six days a week.

20:39.266 --> 20:40.233
Fuck work.

20:41.234 --> 20:43.370
Since when do you
play golf, Coniff?

20:45.605 --> 20:47.174
Oh, Harry Bosch.

20:47.240 --> 20:48.809
Wow, I heard
you were back on.

20:48.876 --> 20:50.844
Been back
a couple of weeks.
Already caught a case.

20:50.911 --> 20:53.280
Pornographer shot twice,
stuffed in the trunk of
his car.

20:53.346 --> 20:55.716
Mm, the relentless glamour
of police work.

20:55.783 --> 20:57.785
This is my partner,
Julie Espinosa.

20:57.851 --> 21:00.020
- Harry Bosch,
nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

21:00.087 --> 21:01.689
Heard you guys
caught a hot one.

21:01.755 --> 21:04.057
- Did we ever.
- Yeah, how's that goin'?

21:04.124 --> 21:05.693
Can't talk to
the kid's partner,

21:05.693 --> 21:07.127
'cause he's out IOD
for stress.

21:07.194 --> 21:09.096
Tenth floor is
way up our ass big time

21:09.162 --> 21:10.864
tellin' us what to do
and when to do it.

21:10.931 --> 21:12.966
Oh, seems like Tenzer'd go
balls to the wall for this one.

21:13.033 --> 21:14.702
Irving's one of his guys.

21:14.768 --> 21:17.270
- Not since he
endorsed O'Shea.
- Oh. True.

21:17.337 --> 21:19.172
You'd think they'd
put politics aside for this.

21:19.239 --> 21:21.709
No such thing Downtown,
right?

21:21.775 --> 21:23.243
Brad.

21:23.310 --> 21:27.180
Yeah. All right, well, um,
we'll figure it out.

21:28.448 --> 21:29.616
Keep your head down,
right?

21:29.717 --> 21:31.184
It's all we can do.

21:31.251 --> 21:33.153
Hey, why don't you stop by
El Campadre sometime,

21:33.220 --> 21:34.788
we'll cough down
a pitcher of margaritas.

21:34.855 --> 21:36.423
I'll do that.

21:36.489 --> 21:37.490
Nice to meet you.

21:37.557 --> 21:38.859
Likewise.

22:15.228 --> 22:18.165
Your agent was
last heard from--

22:18.231 --> 22:21.234
Christmas Eve day.
Two years ago.

22:21.301 --> 22:25.939
Right. So Allen drove
from Los Angeles to Vegas
that night,

22:26.006 --> 22:27.640
stayed about six hours,

22:27.775 --> 22:30.077
Christmas morning he
drove back before dawn.

22:30.143 --> 22:31.478
Quick trip.

22:31.544 --> 22:32.612
It's unusual.

22:32.679 --> 22:34.581
He always stayed
at least a few days.

22:34.647 --> 22:36.149
But not this time.

22:36.216 --> 22:38.418
On his way back,
about 6 a.m.,

22:38.485 --> 22:40.653
he took a detour
off highway 15

22:40.788 --> 22:42.422
a couple miles
and stopped.

22:42.489 --> 22:44.958
For nearly 90 minutes.

22:45.025 --> 22:47.460
Off road in a Bentley
before dawn.

22:47.527 --> 22:49.629
Who does that?

22:49.696 --> 22:51.498
I've made this trip
more times than I
care to remember,

22:51.564 --> 22:53.801
and I can tell you there's
absolutely nothing out there.

22:53.867 --> 22:56.303
It's completely desolate.

22:58.105 --> 23:00.540
So why'd your ex-husband
give you this?

23:00.607 --> 23:02.009
He didn't.

23:02.075 --> 23:04.111
I took it off his desk
and made a copy.

23:04.177 --> 23:06.914
Well, isn't that
just what you said
you wouldn't do.

23:06.980 --> 23:09.182
I said I wouldn't
spy on him.

23:09.249 --> 23:12.119
This is about
your investigation, not his.

23:12.185 --> 23:14.087
Now, that's a
subtle distinction.

23:15.823 --> 23:18.258
I appreciated your offer
and wanted to be of use.

23:23.130 --> 23:24.731
So far...

23:24.832 --> 23:25.966
so good.

23:46.586 --> 23:50.423
- Bosch.
- I'm Downtown.

23:50.490 --> 23:51.524
Give me half an hour.

24:15.715 --> 24:17.384
Looks like a robbery.

24:17.450 --> 24:19.686
It's supposed to.

24:19.752 --> 24:21.288
Called his handler.

24:21.354 --> 24:23.123
Asked him if
George was wearing
a wire that night.

24:23.190 --> 24:25.625
There was no mention
of a wire anywhere.

24:25.692 --> 24:26.960
I know.

24:27.027 --> 24:29.696
Lyle said he was wearing
a wire that night.

24:29.762 --> 24:31.031
His watch.

24:31.098 --> 24:33.666
Which just happened to be
stolen by the shooter.

24:33.733 --> 24:35.635
And Lyle said it was
a coincidence.

24:35.702 --> 24:36.970
Let that play.

24:47.647 --> 24:49.382
Maybe Arceneaux
was involved,

24:49.449 --> 24:51.384
help set up George.

24:51.451 --> 24:53.386
I don't know.

24:53.453 --> 24:55.722
He seems
genuinely distraught.

24:55.788 --> 24:59.192
Maybe his partners didn't
tell him about the hit.

24:59.259 --> 25:01.929
Wanted a real reaction
for the cameras.

25:01.929 --> 25:03.997
We need to talk to him.

25:04.064 --> 25:07.100
RHD has him under
surveillance.

25:07.167 --> 25:10.137
We can find
a way around that.

25:10.203 --> 25:11.171
We?

25:14.207 --> 25:17.945
I assume this is
off the books.

25:17.945 --> 25:19.346
What books?

25:42.069 --> 25:43.470
Eddie, you got a call.

25:43.536 --> 25:46.974
Okay.

25:47.040 --> 25:48.208
Ah.

25:52.412 --> 25:54.681
- Make it quick.
- Yeah, yeah.

25:54.747 --> 25:56.249
Hello.

25:56.316 --> 25:58.585
Officer Arceneaux.
Deputy Chief Irving.

25:58.651 --> 26:01.588
You need to come back
to your house. Now.

26:01.654 --> 26:03.190
We're gonna have that talk.

26:03.256 --> 26:04.891
Yeah, you know I can't
do that, right?

26:04.992 --> 26:07.294
I've seen the video
from the store.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.996
I saw how upset you were.

26:08.996 --> 26:11.264
Yeah, yeah, I was.

26:11.331 --> 26:14.834
I know you didn't know
what was going to happen
to my son that night.

26:14.901 --> 26:16.269
No, I didn't.

26:16.336 --> 26:18.671
RHD thinks
you were part of it.

26:18.738 --> 26:19.839
Oh, I know.

26:19.906 --> 26:21.108
Maybe I could help you.

26:21.174 --> 26:24.011
Yeah,
I don't know about that.

26:24.077 --> 26:26.079
Don't dance with me, son.

26:26.146 --> 26:28.915
You need to tell me
yes or no now.

26:29.016 --> 26:30.617
This chance
won't come again.

26:32.019 --> 26:34.021
Yeah, okay, well,
how do we make that happen?

26:34.087 --> 26:36.623
Go out the rear entrance.

26:36.689 --> 26:39.526
Leave your gun and
your duffle behind,
you're coming back.

26:39.592 --> 26:41.061
There's a car waiting.

26:55.275 --> 26:56.576
Who the hell are you?

26:56.643 --> 26:57.710
Uber.

27:11.291 --> 27:13.893
I'm down the block.

27:13.960 --> 27:15.295
By now they've
figured out you're gone,

27:15.362 --> 27:19.599
they'll be sending a car
to sit on your house.

27:19.666 --> 27:20.767
Uber, huh.

27:33.980 --> 27:36.116
What the fuck?

27:36.183 --> 27:38.118
Man, come on, man.
What are you doing?

27:38.185 --> 27:40.453
- Shut up.
- I will fuckin' kill you.

27:47.694 --> 27:50.097
Fuck!

27:50.130 --> 27:51.631
Goddammit.

27:56.103 --> 27:57.270
Deputy Chief.

27:57.337 --> 28:00.873
You're lucky it's us.
And not La Eme.

28:00.940 --> 28:04.211
La Eme?
What the fuck are you
talking about?

28:04.277 --> 28:05.545
The drop house
in Highland Park

28:05.612 --> 28:07.580
that your crew
ripped off last week.

28:07.647 --> 28:09.749
Two bit trocoteros.

28:09.816 --> 28:11.017
Shit.

28:11.118 --> 28:13.686
Shit is right.
You know Carlos Vega?

28:15.288 --> 28:16.889
Jesus Christ,
what do you want?

28:16.956 --> 28:18.458
Names.

28:18.525 --> 28:19.992
The man who
killed my son,

28:20.127 --> 28:21.661
and the man who
ordered it done.

28:21.728 --> 28:25.298
You told me that you knew that
I had nothing to do with that.

28:25.365 --> 28:28.768
Names, or we drop you
on Vega's doorstep.

28:35.308 --> 28:37.844
I didn't know that
they were gonna kill him.

28:37.910 --> 28:39.546
I swear to God.

28:39.612 --> 28:41.248
George was my friend,
goddammit.

28:41.314 --> 28:43.583
- You keep saying that.
- Names.

28:43.650 --> 28:45.552
You don't understand,
they'll kill me.

28:45.618 --> 28:47.787
Vega will kill you
sure as shit.

28:47.854 --> 28:49.189
Pick your poison.

28:50.557 --> 28:54.727
The last time
I'm gonna ask.

28:54.794 --> 28:56.329
I can't.

28:56.396 --> 28:59.232
Gag him.
Get him in the car.

28:59.299 --> 29:01.868
All right, all right.
Carl Nash.

29:04.871 --> 29:07.039
- Nash?
- Yeah.

29:07.174 --> 29:10.377
Carl Nash.
He's the one that
ordered the hit.

29:10.443 --> 29:13.213
All right, he found out
that George was a rat.

29:18.885 --> 29:20.187
What, you know him?

29:20.220 --> 29:21.621
Ex-homicide.

29:21.688 --> 29:23.290
Out of Van Nuys.

29:23.356 --> 29:25.024
Nash ordered the hit.

29:25.091 --> 29:26.559
Who pulled the trigger?

29:26.626 --> 29:29.196
I can't--
I can't be sure.

29:29.229 --> 29:31.364
Nick Riley. Maybe.

29:31.431 --> 29:33.366
Narcotics.
West Bureau.

29:44.244 --> 29:45.612
The case I'm working,

29:45.678 --> 29:48.215
my victim Tony Allen
lived in Hidden Highlands.

29:48.248 --> 29:50.049
Carl Nash
runs security up there.

29:50.116 --> 29:52.652
He's got a bunch of ex-cops
and cops working for him.

29:52.719 --> 29:55.555
What, you think
the two cases
are connected?

29:55.622 --> 29:57.890
We like Veronica Allen
for her husband's murder,

29:57.957 --> 30:00.059
but she alibied solid.

30:00.126 --> 30:01.328
Maybe she used Nash.

30:01.394 --> 30:02.895
To kill her husband.

30:02.962 --> 30:06.866
Look, she gets to know
the ex-cop at the gatehouse,

30:06.933 --> 30:09.236
trouble at home,
husband's got
a new girlfriend,

30:09.302 --> 30:10.370
they start talking,

30:10.437 --> 30:12.305
one thing
leads to another.

30:12.372 --> 30:15.208
What if Veronica
hired Nash?

30:15.275 --> 30:17.109
Contract murder's
death penalty eligible.

30:17.176 --> 30:19.912
So we get what we can
out of this punk Arceneaux,

30:19.979 --> 30:21.414
and we cut him loose.

30:21.481 --> 30:24.384
We start workin' Nash
on Allen's murder.

30:24.451 --> 30:26.453
We get him on that,
he'll deal.

30:26.519 --> 30:29.456
He'll give up
everybody involved
in your son's murder.

30:29.522 --> 30:31.391
Maybe the shooter, too.

30:45.037 --> 30:46.205
How'd you meet Nash?

30:46.273 --> 30:47.907
He was a gun dealer.

30:47.974 --> 30:50.377
His card was on
the bulletin board
in Van Nuys.

30:50.443 --> 30:52.412
I heard that he could
get me a throw away.

30:52.479 --> 30:53.746
He sells you a throw away,

30:53.813 --> 30:55.147
he knows what kind of
piece of shit cop you are.

30:55.214 --> 30:56.916
He recruited you?

30:56.983 --> 30:58.217
Yeah,
you could say that.

30:58.285 --> 30:59.919
He threw me a couple of
moonlighting gigs.

30:59.986 --> 31:00.953
That's how it started.

31:01.020 --> 31:02.522
How many in his crew?

31:02.589 --> 31:04.624
I don't know.
I only know the people
that I work with.

31:04.691 --> 31:07.427
- Which are who?
- Jesus Christ.

31:09.496 --> 31:11.864
Maureen O'Grady,
Nick Riley,

31:11.931 --> 31:13.300
Bernardo Piccininni.

31:13.300 --> 31:15.201
All cops.

31:15.302 --> 31:19.306
Yeah. Valley.
West Bureau.

31:19.339 --> 31:20.973
And they all work with Nash
up at Highlands.

31:21.040 --> 31:22.141
Yeah.

31:22.208 --> 31:23.810
Tell me about
Tony Allen.

31:25.345 --> 31:26.546
I'm sorry,
I don't know who that is.

31:26.613 --> 31:27.714
Were you there that night?

31:27.780 --> 31:29.982
- What night?
- The night he was hit.

31:30.049 --> 31:34.186
Fuck you. I-- I'm telling you
I don't know any Tony Allen.

31:34.321 --> 31:37.457
All right?
And I sure as shit
don't know about any hits.

31:37.524 --> 31:39.058
Nash never mentioned him.

31:39.125 --> 31:41.428
No. No fuckin' way.
He never mentioned any murders.

31:41.494 --> 31:42.929
I didn't do any murders,

31:42.995 --> 31:45.197
and I had no idea that
he was gonna do George, either.

31:45.332 --> 31:46.433
I swear to God.

31:55.608 --> 31:56.909
Ahh!

32:01.080 --> 32:02.915
You have a choice.

32:02.982 --> 32:05.852
Tell RHD what you know
and cut a deal for yourself--

32:05.918 --> 32:07.053
Oh, fuck that.

32:07.119 --> 32:08.388
Or do nothing.

32:08.455 --> 32:10.957
And wait for La Chuleta
to come get you.

32:12.592 --> 32:14.361
Word gets around.

32:14.394 --> 32:17.063
What, you're gonna put
my name on the street?

32:17.129 --> 32:18.097
What? I thought that
we had a deal.

32:18.164 --> 32:19.699
Deal?

32:19.766 --> 32:23.470
Motherfucker,
I don't make deals
with dirty cops.

32:23.536 --> 32:25.472
Now, you have 24 hours.

32:25.538 --> 32:28.508
Then La Eme gets
your name and address.

32:40.420 --> 32:42.288
We need to
hedge our bets.

32:42.389 --> 32:45.291
Get Nash's name to RHD.

32:45.392 --> 32:48.828
Let me handle that.

32:48.895 --> 32:51.163
What would you have done
if he hadn't coughed it up?

32:51.230 --> 32:53.400
Given his name
to La Eme.

32:59.806 --> 33:02.742
**

33:17.990 --> 33:19.759
Coniff.

33:19.826 --> 33:20.693
Hey, Bosch.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.562
Twice in the same day.

33:22.629 --> 33:24.096
Can I get you
a margarita?

33:24.163 --> 33:25.131
Got a minute?

33:26.599 --> 33:28.701
Save my stool.

33:28.768 --> 33:30.269
Ah, that didn't
sound right.

33:30.336 --> 33:32.038
Save my seat.

33:32.104 --> 33:34.474
Okay.

33:34.541 --> 33:35.942
What's up?

33:36.008 --> 33:37.944
I got a lead for you
on the Irving case.

33:38.010 --> 33:39.512
A lead that
you didn't have
this morning.

33:39.579 --> 33:42.214
Came in an hour ago
in my case.

33:42.281 --> 33:43.450
The pornographer.

33:43.483 --> 33:44.484
And it's
connected to ours?

33:44.551 --> 33:46.719
So it would seem.

33:46.786 --> 33:48.921
You're such a prick.

33:48.988 --> 33:51.891
You didn't just
run into me this morning,
you were workin' me.

33:51.958 --> 33:53.359
I knew I shouldn't have
fuckin' talked to you.

33:53.460 --> 33:55.261
You want this or not?

33:59.298 --> 34:00.600
Let me hear it.

34:00.667 --> 34:03.803
Carl Nash,
ex-homicide, Van Nuys.

34:03.870 --> 34:06.473
Runs security up at
Hidden Highlands, hires cops.

34:06.506 --> 34:08.808
Word is he's the go-to guy
around Valley Bureau

34:08.875 --> 34:10.910
to get weapons,
legal or not.

34:10.977 --> 34:13.012
And this is connected to
the Irving murder how?

34:13.079 --> 34:15.615
This Nash sold guns
to Eddie Arceneaux.

34:18.485 --> 34:20.152
Okay.

34:20.219 --> 34:21.287
We'll look into it.

34:21.353 --> 34:23.956
Let me know if it pans out.

34:24.023 --> 34:25.157
Go fuck yourself.

34:42.008 --> 34:42.909
Harry.

34:42.975 --> 34:44.877
Hey, how'd it go
up there today?

34:44.944 --> 34:47.514
I located the spot
where he stopped the car.

34:47.580 --> 34:48.948
Called SID.

34:49.015 --> 34:50.517
- You find anything?
-Nothing.

34:50.550 --> 34:52.619
No blood,
no shell casings.

34:52.685 --> 34:54.687
Found a suitcase
down the hill in the brush.

34:54.754 --> 34:56.523
The black Toomey
his wife told us about?

34:56.556 --> 34:58.390
Nothing in it
but laundry.

34:58.525 --> 35:00.292
Confirms the location.
Great work, Jerry.

35:00.359 --> 35:02.929
Thanks. You called me.
What's up?

35:02.995 --> 35:04.296
Carl Nash.

35:04.363 --> 35:05.698
You got something on him?

35:05.765 --> 35:09.135
Yeah, I got a tip
he sells guns on the side.

35:09.201 --> 35:10.236
I want to check it out.

35:10.302 --> 35:11.738
How's it connected
to our case?

35:11.804 --> 35:13.540
I'm not sure yet.

35:13.573 --> 35:15.207
I need you to do
something for me.

35:15.274 --> 35:16.909
Shoot.

35:23.750 --> 35:25.184
He's at work.

35:27.019 --> 35:29.188
You gonna tell me
what this is about?

35:29.255 --> 35:31.858
- I'll explain it later.
- See you back at the house.

35:41.433 --> 35:43.570
Sure he's at work?

35:43.603 --> 35:45.638
Yeah.
J. Edgar confirmed it.

35:54.881 --> 35:57.584
No alarms,
no security cameras.

35:57.584 --> 36:00.386
Apparently, he doesn't
feel the need.

36:00.452 --> 36:01.621
Yeah.

36:17.604 --> 36:18.838
You're good at that.

36:18.905 --> 36:20.707
I usually have a warrant.

37:21.333 --> 37:22.869
These were in the vent.

37:25.738 --> 37:27.707
Nash was looking at
Tony Allen.

37:28.775 --> 37:31.043
He knew about Layla.

37:31.110 --> 37:32.979
He knew how to
set up Rykoff,

37:33.045 --> 37:36.683
make Tony Allen's murder
look like a mob hit.

37:36.749 --> 37:38.951
So what do we do?

37:39.018 --> 37:41.553
We get a search warrant,
come back, get these legally.

37:41.688 --> 37:42.689
And these are enough?

37:42.722 --> 37:43.890
These are enough.

37:45.357 --> 37:46.458
Murder for hire.

37:46.525 --> 37:47.894
The whole plan
is right here.

37:47.960 --> 37:50.362
Big question is,
whose idea was it,

37:50.429 --> 37:52.732
his or Veronica Allen's?

38:05.377 --> 38:06.913
What the fuck
are you doin' here?

38:06.979 --> 38:09.348
Relax.
I ran parallels.

38:10.717 --> 38:12.284
Did you check for
a GPS bug?

38:12.351 --> 38:13.953
Yeah. Of course, I did.

38:14.020 --> 38:15.855
It's on my car
which is at the gym.

38:15.922 --> 38:18.290
Whose shit box is this?

38:18.357 --> 38:20.059
I borrowed it.

38:20.126 --> 38:22.161
All right,
we need to talk.

38:24.363 --> 38:25.431
Follow me.

38:25.497 --> 38:26.766
Back in a few.

38:26.833 --> 38:28.000
Roger that.

38:52.058 --> 38:54.060
- All right, listen--
- Shut the fuck up.

38:54.126 --> 38:57.830
Come on, man,
I'm not wearing a wire.

38:57.897 --> 39:00.566
Give me your phone.
And your watch.

39:00.632 --> 39:01.868
What?

39:01.934 --> 39:03.970
Give them to me now.

39:04.036 --> 39:06.205
Oh, you gotta be
kidding me.

39:06.272 --> 39:07.439
Seriously.

39:10.242 --> 39:11.844
There. Happy?

39:14.781 --> 39:15.882
Dude!

39:19.485 --> 39:21.788
You wanted to talk,
talk.

39:21.821 --> 39:23.790
They came at me
pretty hard.

39:23.823 --> 39:26.658
RHD?
They can't talk to you.

39:26.793 --> 39:28.194
No, not RHD.

39:28.260 --> 39:30.562
Deputy Chief Irving
and one of his dogs.

39:30.629 --> 39:32.064
Irving himself
came to you?

39:32.131 --> 39:33.232
Yeah.

39:33.299 --> 39:35.367
Jesus, he's runnin'
off the books.

39:35.434 --> 39:37.536
- Yeah, no shit
it's off the books.
- What did they say?

39:37.603 --> 39:40.807
So you know that
shitty little drop house
over in Highland Park?

39:40.873 --> 39:42.942
- That was La Eme.
- The fuck it was.

39:43.009 --> 39:44.110
No, the fuck it was.

39:44.176 --> 39:45.812
And you know who else
they brought up?

39:45.878 --> 39:48.480
This guy La Chuleta.
You know him?

39:48.547 --> 39:50.817
Fuck!

39:51.818 --> 39:54.120
What else?

39:54.186 --> 39:56.055
They asked me about
Tony Allen.

39:58.991 --> 40:00.526
What did you
tell them?

40:00.592 --> 40:03.062
I didn't tell them shit.
Nothing.

40:03.129 --> 40:04.964
But you listen to me,
there's blood in the water.

40:05.031 --> 40:06.999
They know what's
going on with us.

40:07.066 --> 40:08.700
Any names come up?

40:08.767 --> 40:09.869
No.

40:09.936 --> 40:12.071
No, but they
definitely have eyes

40:12.138 --> 40:16.342
on me and O'Grady.
It is time to get out.

40:16.408 --> 40:19.078
Oh, so th--
this is where you
shake me down?

40:19.145 --> 40:21.280
It's exit time, Carl.
All right?

40:21.347 --> 40:23.315
I want my piece
and you owe me.

40:23.382 --> 40:26.652
You know I don't
have it yet.

40:26.718 --> 40:29.188
Ah, fuck.

40:29.255 --> 40:32.925
I am not in a
begging kind of mood,
all right?

40:32.992 --> 40:37.096
I came all the way out here
to give you a head's up.

40:37.163 --> 40:39.999
To tell you
what's what.

40:40.066 --> 40:41.733
Just hang tough
a few more days.

40:41.800 --> 40:42.902
As soon as it
comes through,

40:42.969 --> 40:44.470
everybody gets
their share.

40:44.536 --> 40:48.007
Fuck that!
I am the one who's
exposed here, all right?

40:48.074 --> 40:49.741
Me. I was his partner.

40:49.808 --> 40:51.143
I'm the one that's in
the crosshairs,

40:51.210 --> 40:53.445
and I have to get
the fuck out of here

40:53.512 --> 40:55.214
while I still can.

41:03.589 --> 41:06.325
All right, all right.

41:06.392 --> 41:07.726
Go home.

41:07.793 --> 41:10.396
I'll front your piece.

41:10.462 --> 41:12.398
Somebody'll come by
with what you're owed.

41:12.464 --> 41:13.332
When?

41:13.399 --> 41:14.901
Tomorrow.
The next day.

41:14.967 --> 41:16.602
Don't worry,
you'll get it.

41:16.668 --> 41:18.905
In the meantime...

41:18.905 --> 41:20.372
pull it together, man.

41:22.474 --> 41:24.010
Don't forget your shit.

41:24.076 --> 41:26.612
Yeah. Thanks again.

41:59.145 --> 42:02.214
These people
are responsible.

42:02.281 --> 42:05.417
Those are the fuckers
that killed your son.

42:05.484 --> 42:06.818
So now what?

42:06.953 --> 42:08.087
Tomorrow we get
a search warrant,

42:08.154 --> 42:09.956
serve it as soon as
the judge signs off.

42:10.022 --> 42:13.025
We find the photos,
open the gun safe.

42:13.092 --> 42:15.494
And then we arrest Carl Nash
for Tony Allen's murder.

42:15.561 --> 42:17.563
- And RHD?
- They'll get their
shot at him

42:17.629 --> 42:19.498
after Nash cuts a deal
on the Allen hit,

42:19.565 --> 42:21.467
starts talkin' about
George's murder.

42:21.533 --> 42:23.202
I want to be there
when you arrest him.

42:23.269 --> 42:25.071
I don't think that's
a good idea, sir,

42:25.137 --> 42:26.105
with what
we've been doing.

42:26.172 --> 42:27.974
I want to be there.

42:42.221 --> 42:47.059
I'm gonna
look you in the eye,
motherfucker.

42:47.126 --> 42:49.295
I'm gonna
look you in the eye.

44:38.537 --> 44:39.771
No.

44:47.113 --> 44:48.480
Bitch.

44:51.117 --> 44:52.718
The fucking bitch.

45:51.843 --> 45:52.811
Hi, Eddie.

45:57.015 --> 45:59.185
- Mo.
- I have your money.

46:01.086 --> 46:03.455
You scared the
fuckin' shit out of me.

46:03.522 --> 46:06.258
Wait, I thought that you--
I thought you weren't comin'
'til tomorrow.

46:06.325 --> 46:07.426
Well, you know Carl,

46:07.493 --> 46:09.528
once he gets
a bug in his ear.

46:09.595 --> 46:11.463
He told me to
take care of it tonight.

46:16.202 --> 46:17.936
Yeah, all right.
Let me get the lights.

46:18.003 --> 46:20.206
Okay.

46:34.820 --> 46:37.756
**
