12:40.469 --> 12:42.702
Superheroes are illegal.

12:42.704 --> 12:44.671
Whether it's fair or not,
that's the law.

12:44.673 --> 12:47.808
The law should be fair. What
are we teaching our kids?

12:47.810 --> 12:49.142
To respect the law!

12:49.144 --> 12:50.544
Even when the law
is disrespectful?

12:50.546 --> 12:53.380
If laws are unjust, there
are laws to change them!

12:53.382 --> 12:54.548
Otherwise, it's chaos!

12:54.550 --> 12:56.652
Which is exactly
what we have!

13:02.658 --> 13:04.658
I just thought
it was kinda cool.

13:04.660 --> 13:08.695
- What was?
- Fighting crime as a family.

13:08.697 --> 13:11.832
(SIGHS) It was cool.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.869
ELASTIGIRL: But it's over.
The world is what it is.

13:14.871 --> 13:17.170
We have to adapt.

13:17.172 --> 13:18.839
Are things bad?

13:18.841 --> 13:20.475
Things are fine.

13:21.710 --> 13:22.779
May I be excused?

13:25.147 --> 13:26.914
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ON TV)

13:26.916 --> 13:29.917
How much longer
in the motel, Dad?

13:29.919 --> 13:32.754
- Uh...
- Not much longer, honey.

13:40.162 --> 13:41.261

gonna do?

13:41.263 --> 13:43.163
BOB: I don't know.

13:43.165 --> 13:44.664
Maybe Dicker
will find something?

13:44.666 --> 13:45.800
Dicker is done, Bob.

13:45.802 --> 13:49.336
Any thought we had about being
Supers again is fantasy.

13:49.338 --> 13:50.938
One of us
has gotta get a job.

13:50.940 --> 13:52.339
One of us?

13:52.341 --> 13:54.407
You did a long stint
at Insuricare.

13:54.409 --> 13:56.242
Hated every minute of it.

13:56.244 --> 13:57.778
I know
it was hard on you.

13:57.780 --> 13:59.613
Maybe it's my turn
in the private sector

13:59.615 --> 14:01.247
and you take care
of the kids...

14:01.249 --> 14:04.751
No, I'm doing this.
I need to do this.

We can't count
on anyone else now, Bob.

I know when to leave a party.

14:35.785 --> 14:37.484
I'm just as illegal
as you guys.

14:37.486 --> 14:40.286
Besides, I knew the cops
would let you go.

14:40.288 --> 14:41.889
Yeah, in spite
of Bob's best efforts.

14:41.891 --> 14:43.523
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:43.525 --> 14:46.393

How much longer
are you in this motel?

14:48.296 --> 14:49.562
Two weeks.

14:49.564 --> 14:51.364
Now, you know
the offer still stands.

14:51.366 --> 14:53.600
You're very generous,
but there are five of us.

14:53.602 --> 14:55.402
We wouldn't do that
to you and Honey.

14:55.404 --> 14:56.804
Well, door's always open.

were being detained...

with me, with you two,
about hero stuff.

15:11.553 --> 15:12.787

I checked him out.

15:12.789 --> 15:13.720
He's legit.

15:13.722 --> 15:15.588
Trained under Dicker.
He wants to meet.

15:15.590 --> 15:17.724
Ah, jeez!
More superhero trouble.

15:17.726 --> 15:19.759
We just came from

- When?
- Tonight. I'm going there now.

You enjoy,
I'm sitting this one out.

15:25.500 --> 15:26.934
He wants
all three of us.

Honey, let's just at least
hear what he has to say.

You got the address,
I'll meet you guys there.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.742
Go in our Supersuits?

15:35.744 --> 15:37.377
Yeah.

15:37.379 --> 15:39.646
Might wanna wear
the old Supersuits.

15:39.648 --> 15:42.718
Got a feeling
he's nostalgic.

Spectacular.

My father was so proud

17:29.491 --> 17:32.625
that I was even remotely
connected to you guys.

18:32.955 --> 18:35.823
If superheroes had not been
forced underground...

18:35.825 --> 18:37.091
it never would've happened.

18:37.093 --> 18:39.692
Or Dad could've taken
Mom to the safe room

18:39.694 --> 18:41.028
as soon as he knew
there was trouble.

18:41.030 --> 18:42.562

But we're not going
into it right now.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.699
The point is...

18:46.701 --> 18:48.601
nobody expected us

18:48.603 --> 18:51.038
to be able to actually
run Dad's company.

But with Evelyn as designer,
and myself as operator...

18:54.777 --> 18:57.244
uh, we threw ourselves
into building DEVTECH

19:06.155 --> 19:07.922
Hence, this meeting.

19:07.924 --> 19:09.656
Let me
ask you something.

19:09.658 --> 19:11.491
What is the main reason

19:11.493 --> 19:13.060
you were all
forced underground?

19:13.062 --> 19:15.129
- Ignorance.
- Perception.

19:15.131 --> 19:17.664
Take today for example,
with the Underminer.

19:17.666 --> 19:19.099
Difficult situation.

19:19.101 --> 19:21.501
You were faced with a
lot of hard decisions.

19:21.503 --> 19:22.669
Oh, tell me about it.

19:22.671 --> 19:23.904
WINSTON: I can't.

19:23.906 --> 19:26.572
Because I didn't see it...

19:26.574 --> 19:28.175
neither did anyone else.

19:28.177 --> 19:30.576
So, when you fight bad
guys like today...

19:30.578 --> 19:33.213
people don't see the fight
or what led up to it.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.816
They see what politicians
tell them to see.

19:35.818 --> 19:38.718
They see destruction
and they see you.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.120
So, if we wanna change

19:40.122 --> 19:42.923
people's perceptions
about superheroes...

19:42.925 --> 19:43.891
we need you

19:43.893 --> 19:46.260
to share your perceptions
with the world.

19:46.262 --> 19:48.561
- How do we do that?
- EVELYN: With cameras.

19:48.563 --> 19:52.699
<i>We need you to share your
perceptions with the world.</i>

19:52.701 --> 19:53.934
ELASTIGIRL:
<i>How do we do that?</i>

19:53.936 --> 19:56.136
EVELYN: We embed
tiny cameras, like those,

19:56.138 --> 19:57.570
into your Supersuits.

19:57.572 --> 19:58.771
Wow, so small.

19:58.773 --> 20:00.274
And the picture
is outstanding.

Thanks!
Designed 'em myself.

resources, lobbyists,

20:03.645 --> 20:04.979
worldwide connections...

20:04.981 --> 20:07.547
and very important,
insurance.

20:07.549 --> 20:08.849
Insurance is key.

20:08.851 --> 20:11.251
All we need now are the
super-est superheroes.

20:11.253 --> 20:13.720
It needs you three.
Come on!

20:13.722 --> 20:17.091

legal again.

20:17.093 --> 20:18.192
This sounds great!

20:18.194 --> 20:20.660
Let's get this going.
What's my first assignment?

20:20.662 --> 20:22.729
That enthusiasm is golden.

20:22.731 --> 20:24.999
Now hold on to it.
But for our first move...

20:25.001 --> 20:28.768
Well, Elastigirl
is our best play.

20:28.770 --> 20:31.606
- Better than me?

20:48.891 --> 20:50.924
Well, Evelyn did
a cost-benefit analysis...

20:50.926 --> 20:53.293
comparing all your last
five years of crime fighting

20:53.295 --> 20:54.995
before going underground.

20:54.997 --> 20:56.997
And Elastigirl's numbers
are self-explanatory.

20:56.999 --> 20:59.033
Well, it's not
a fair comparison!

20:59.035 --> 21:01.869
Heavyweight problems
need heavyweight solutions.

21:01.871 --> 21:03.636
Of course!
We're gonna solve

21:03.638 --> 21:05.705
all kinds
of problems together.

21:05.707 --> 21:10.112
After the perfect launch
with Elastigirl!

21:10.846 --> 21:13.280
So, what do you say?

21:13.282 --> 21:15.851
What do I say?
(CHUCKLES)

21:16.651 --> 21:18.852
I don't know.

21:18.854 --> 21:20.620
What do you mean,
you don't know?

21:20.622 --> 21:22.956
A few hours ago, you were
saying it was over...

21:22.958 --> 21:25.159
and being a superhero
was a fantasy.

21:25.161 --> 21:27.261
Now, you get the offer
of a lifetime

21:27.263 --> 21:28.929
and you don't know?

21:28.931 --> 21:32.099
It's not that simple, Bob.
I wanna protect the kids!

21:32.101 --> 21:33.666
So do I.

21:33.668 --> 21:35.202
From jail, Bob!

21:35.204 --> 21:36.769
- (SPITS)
- BOB: And how do you do that?

21:36.771 --> 21:38.939
By turning down a chance
to change the law

21:38.941 --> 21:40.340
that forces them to hide
what they are?

21:40.342 --> 21:42.976
They haven't decided what they are.
They're still kids.

21:42.978 --> 21:45.312
Kids with powers,
which makes them Supers...

21:45.314 --> 21:47.948
whether they decide to
use those powers or not.

21:47.950 --> 21:49.316
This will benefit them.

21:49.318 --> 21:51.118
It's not a good time
to be away.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.886
Dash is having trouble
with homework...

21:52.888 --> 21:54.788

21:57.026 --> 21:59.993

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.174
I know
I should be up there...

01:12:47.176 --> 01:12:49.376
but I had to step away from
the grip and grins, you know?

01:12:49.378 --> 01:12:52.779
Gotta get away to keep it pure.
I know I do.

01:12:52.781 --> 01:12:54.281
What are you getting
away from?

01:12:54.283 --> 01:12:57.851
Eh, you know, company stuff.
My brother, mostly.

01:12:57.853 --> 01:12:59.853
But you love him,
you two are this company.

01:12:59.855 --> 01:13:01.221
Yin and yang.

01:13:01.223 --> 01:13:03.357
Yeah, I invent the stuff,
he's good at people.

01:13:03.359 --> 01:13:07.895
Pleasing them, engaging them,
figuring out what they want.

01:13:07.897 --> 01:13:10.030
I never know
what people want.

01:13:10.032 --> 01:13:11.867
What do you think
they want?

01:13:12.168 --> 01:13:13.233
Ease.

01:13:13.235 --> 01:13:16.170
People will trade quality
for ease every time.

01:13:16.172 --> 01:13:19.772
It may be crap,
but hey, it's convenient.

01:13:19.774 --> 01:13:21.475
Yeah. Kind of
like this case.

01:13:21.477 --> 01:13:22.809
What?
The Screenslaver?

01:13:22.811 --> 01:13:24.511
Yeah, something's not
sitting right.

01:13:24.513 --> 01:13:26.046
It was too easy.

01:13:26.048 --> 01:13:28.817
That was too easy?
(CHUCKLES) Wow.

01:13:29.418 --> 01:13:31.451
- Funny.
- What?

01:13:31.453 --> 01:13:33.053
Look at that.

01:13:33.055 --> 01:13:37.191
One of Screenslaver's monitors
is tuned into my suit cam.

01:13:37.193 --> 01:13:39.126
What?

01:13:39.128 --> 01:13:41.261
Isn't the suit cam
closed circuit?

01:13:41.263 --> 01:13:42.029
It is.

01:13:42.031 --> 01:13:44.898
Then how come
Screenslaver has it?

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:46.366
Maybe he hacked it?

01:13:46.368 --> 01:13:49.069
So, he's sophisticated enough
to do that...

01:13:49.071 --> 01:13:51.838
but he has simple locks
on his doors?

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.874
Maybe he wanted you
to find him.

01:13:53.876 --> 01:13:55.342
He wanted to get caught?

01:13:55.344 --> 01:13:57.311
He wanted you to win.

01:13:57.313 --> 01:13:59.813
That makes no sense.
He's a brilliant guy.

01:13:59.815 --> 01:14:01.081
If he's smart enough
to conceive

01:14:01.083 --> 01:14:02.549
of technology like this...

01:14:02.551 --> 01:14:05.085
he's smart enough to think
of something to do with it.

01:14:05.087 --> 01:14:07.221
The guy we put in jail
delivered pizzas.

01:14:07.223 --> 01:14:08.188
So?

01:14:08.190 --> 01:14:09.990
Einstein was
a patent clerk.

01:14:09.992 --> 01:14:12.125
Look, you won.
You got the guy who...

01:14:12.127 --> 01:14:14.494
Wait. All Screenslaver
needs to do

01:14:14.496 --> 01:14:15.896
to hypnotize someone...

01:14:15.898 --> 01:14:17.998
is get a screen
in front of their eyes.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.171
But what if the screen
doesn't look like a screen?

01:14:24.373 --> 01:14:28.909
What if the pizza guy
is really a pizza guy...

01:14:28.911 --> 01:14:30.210
but he was controlled
by the screens

01:14:30.212 --> 01:14:31.380
built into his glasses...

01:14:32.848 --> 01:14:34.883

Yes, I'm sure your gratitude
is quite inexpressible.

Don't ask me
to do it again, darling.

Oh, uh...

I am joking, Robert.
I enjoyed the assignment.

He is bright

01:15:19.561 --> 01:15:21.595
We deserve each other.

Your child is a polymorph.

01:15:23.966 --> 01:15:26.300
Like all babies,
he has enormous potential.

01:15:26.302 --> 01:15:28.101
It is not unknown
for supers

to have more than one
power when young...

01:15:29.938 --> 01:15:32.572

Babies can be anything,

and your child
is no exception.

01:15:56.198 --> 01:15:59.099
He has pure,
unlimited potential, Robert.

01:15:59.101 --> 01:16:02.169
He slept while I worked
in a creative fever.

01:16:02.171 --> 01:16:04.571

He is part
of the demonstration

01:16:13.082 --> 01:16:14.214
and will be fine.

01:16:14.216 --> 01:16:16.216
Your challenge
is to manage a baby

01:16:16.218 --> 01:16:17.984
who has
multiple powers...

01:16:17.986 --> 01:16:21.121
and no control
over them, yes?

01:16:21.123 --> 01:16:22.622
Huh. That sums it up.

01:16:22.624 --> 01:16:24.157
I often work to music

01:16:24.159 --> 01:16:27.094
and I noticed the baby
responds to it as well.

01:16:27.096 --> 01:16:29.096
Specifically, Mozart.

Interwoven with these fabrics
are a mesh of tiny sensors...

01:16:38.207 --> 01:16:41.274

Oh, Lord! (STAMMERS)
What is he doing?

01:16:44.313 --> 01:16:47.381
Well, it's Mozart, Robert.
Can you blame him?

01:16:47.383 --> 01:16:49.683
The important thing is that
the suit and tracker...

01:16:49.685 --> 01:16:51.985
anticipated the change
and alerted you.

01:16:51.987 --> 01:16:53.086
Oh, no. Cookies.

01:16:53.088 --> 01:16:54.588
I gotta get cookies!

01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:56.556
You do not need cookies.

01:16:56.558 --> 01:16:57.691

01:16:57.693 --> 01:16:59.025

01:16:59.027 --> 01:17:00.594
any solution involving cookies

01:17:00.596 --> 01:17:03.663

has countermeasures.
