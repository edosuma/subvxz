00:52.705 --> 00:54.621
I could've helped you with that.

01:09.489 --> 01:11.656
It's a little uneven in the back.

01:11.760 --> 01:13.359
- Oh.
- Here.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.617
Thanks.

01:20.306 --> 01:22.169
I just, uh...

01:22.278 --> 01:24.549
I wanted a change, you
know, something I chose.

01:24.602 --> 01:26.117
I understand.

01:27.026 --> 01:28.621
It looks good.

01:31.561 --> 01:32.981
Are you okay?

01:34.028 --> 01:35.785
Yeah, I just, uh...

01:36.683 --> 01:40.264
I just... I think I just remembered, um...

01:41.593 --> 01:45.153
There was a woman... a doctor.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.959
What kind of doctor?

01:48.029 --> 01:50.602
She was... she was treating me.

01:50.676 --> 01:53.863
But it wasn't in a
hospital, I was in a house.

01:53.943 --> 01:56.288
It must've been after
I survived the attack.

02:00.331 --> 02:01.773
The Orion attack?

02:01.828 --> 02:05.194
Did I ever mention a doctor to you?

02:05.280 --> 02:07.529
Oh...

02:07.607 --> 02:11.265
She found you wandering outside
the town she was stationed in.

02:11.385 --> 02:12.933
Near death.

02:14.051 --> 02:17.088
You wouldn't have lived
another day without her help.

02:17.873 --> 02:19.634
Where is she now?

02:21.031 --> 02:24.839
You told us she was killed
shortly after you were rescued.

02:25.182 --> 02:27.374
An enemy attack on the town?

02:27.914 --> 02:29.701
How did I survive?

02:29.980 --> 02:34.077
She had you out walking every day
as part of your rehabilitation.

02:34.143 --> 02:36.597
You were up in the mountains
when the strike came.

02:38.918 --> 02:40.956
How did I get back here?

02:41.443 --> 02:43.720
You had to hide on your own for weeks.

02:43.822 --> 02:47.436
Eventually, you managed to
stow away on a cargo ship.

02:47.759 --> 02:51.477
I just... I don't remember any of that.

02:51.512 --> 02:54.499
What matters is you're home now.

02:55.238 --> 02:56.976
With your family.

02:58.640 --> 03:00.854
Focus on the future.

03:02.133 --> 03:04.551
That's the only thing you can control.

03:14.706 --> 03:16.523
I still don't get it.

03:16.636 --> 03:18.447
Why were they watching me?

03:20.239 --> 03:22.301
What do I have that Sandstorm wants?

03:22.356 --> 03:25.162
I don't know, but my
source at Sandstorm told me

03:25.207 --> 03:27.833
to follow the cogs, that that would lead

03:27.891 --> 03:29.267
to the answer behind everything.

03:29.327 --> 03:31.512
So I'm a small part of
Shepherd's big machine.

03:31.559 --> 03:36.392
Look, until we figure out how and
where you fit in, we keep digging, okay?

03:36.464 --> 03:40.067
Speaking of digging... what's that?

03:40.147 --> 03:42.736
It's a phone that my source
managed to get to our dead drop.

03:42.794 --> 03:43.963
We don't know what's on it yet.

03:44.011 --> 03:45.454
Can't seem to crack the encryption.

03:45.498 --> 03:48.725
All right, so why don't you put one
of your fancy NSA supercomputers on it?

03:48.764 --> 03:52.423
They are, but it's a type of encryption
we've never dealt with before.

03:52.524 --> 03:56.042
We could break it later
today or 200 years from now.

03:57.445 --> 03:58.699
You know, I've...

03:58.734 --> 04:02.091
I've noticed that you're
barely in these yearbooks.

04:02.130 --> 04:04.342
I hated military school.

04:04.427 --> 04:06.558
After Taylor disappeared...

04:06.933 --> 04:11.329
I was pretty sure my father
was responsible, so...

04:11.383 --> 04:14.471
made it kind of hard for both
of us to be in the same house.

04:14.525 --> 04:16.879
Yeah, that must've been awful.

04:16.947 --> 04:19.333
So worried about my sister,
I broke out all the time.

04:19.368 --> 04:21.414
Snuck home, just to check on her,

04:21.466 --> 04:23.206
make sure she was okay.

04:23.857 --> 04:25.145
Surprised they didn't expel me.

04:25.180 --> 04:27.091
Oh, quite the opposite, it seems.

04:27.143 --> 04:30.663
Looks like you won some scholarships
in your last few years there.

04:31.351 --> 04:34.735
Part of the lottery of
being an underprivileged kid.

04:34.798 --> 04:36.978
Outstanding marksman, huh?

04:37.039 --> 04:40.360
I was that, for sure. See?

04:40.410 --> 04:42.242
I was voted class clown.

04:42.319 --> 04:44.130
- Really?
- Of course not.

04:44.165 --> 04:45.669
Yeah.

04:46.795 --> 04:48.648
Uh, sorry to interrupt...

04:48.707 --> 04:50.214
That's all right. What do you got?

04:50.258 --> 04:53.430
I think I figured out how to
decode the black hole photo.

04:53.465 --> 04:55.071
From Mayfair's USB drive?

04:56.624 --> 04:57.546
How?

04:57.627 --> 05:00.309
Patterson's been stumped
on that for months.

05:00.372 --> 05:01.143
Shadowcat.

05:01.180 --> 05:03.153
I've got a job for you, off the books.

05:03.192 --> 05:05.063
What do you say, Shadowcat?

05:05.115 --> 05:09.024
No! We are not sharing top-secret
intel with a dark web hacker.

05:10.905 --> 05:13.419
- You already did.
- I just showed him the photo.

05:13.454 --> 05:15.845
I didn't let him decipher
it, but I think he knows how.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.330
Laminar flow.

05:18.863 --> 05:21.514
Actually, that... might actually work.

05:21.564 --> 05:23.902
Do you two wanna explain
what laminar flow is?

05:23.950 --> 05:25.926
Basically, when you pour
your milk into your coffee,

05:25.981 --> 05:28.045
it creates millions of spiraling streams,

05:28.102 --> 05:31.042
but if you could rewind, unswirl the milk,

05:31.092 --> 05:33.904
you could see what the milk looked
like before it hit the coffee.

05:33.977 --> 05:34.854
And we can do that?

05:34.893 --> 05:36.970
Yeah, with enough computing
power, we can do anything.

05:37.032 --> 05:41.055
Okay, look, I'm gonna get my
team on it and loop Patterson in.

05:41.157 --> 05:42.191
Nice work.

05:42.248 --> 05:43.737
Thank you.

05:43.852 --> 05:48.466
But if you ever show secret information
to a convict again, without clearance...

05:48.578 --> 05:50.196
I'll have your badge.

05:53.635 --> 05:56.177
Damn, I'd better go.

05:56.212 --> 05:57.560
Uh, is everything okay?

05:57.595 --> 05:59.840
Oh, yeah, just a...

06:00.046 --> 06:02.279
doctor's appointment. It's nothing.

06:10.589 --> 06:11.897
Excuse me, sir.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.865
You can't sleep here.

06:14.937 --> 06:16.360
You need to move your car.

06:16.402 --> 06:17.807
Sorry about that.

06:35.975 --> 06:38.148
It's lucky you had this extra toothbrush.

06:39.686 --> 06:41.524
The dentist always gives me an extra one.

06:41.559 --> 06:42.904
Yeah, to use.

06:42.974 --> 06:44.431
I like this one.

06:44.979 --> 06:46.357
Hey, you, uh...

06:47.868 --> 06:49.495
you wanna ride in together?

06:50.076 --> 06:51.510
To work?

06:51.630 --> 06:53.488
Like, at the same time?

06:53.523 --> 06:56.559
Yeah, in the together sense of together.

06:56.651 --> 06:58.735
I mean, if you're uncomfortable with it...

06:58.927 --> 07:01.854
No, no, I'm... I'm not uncomfortable.

07:01.909 --> 07:04.576
It's the opposite, I'm
totally comfortable with it.

07:04.634 --> 07:06.121
- I just feel...
- Great.

07:12.173 --> 07:13.760
Yeah, it's great.

07:18.761 --> 07:21.401
It's great. Great. Yeah.

07:22.339 --> 07:23.941
I'm fine, Kurt.

07:23.986 --> 07:26.026
I can get off the table on my own.

07:26.689 --> 07:27.619
Fine.

07:29.698 --> 07:31.722
Talk to your boss yet?

07:31.797 --> 07:33.199
About what?

07:33.605 --> 07:35.180
Taking a step back.

07:35.245 --> 07:36.860
Not being out in the field so much.

07:36.913 --> 07:38.006
Why would I do that?

07:38.041 --> 07:40.033
You heard what the doctor said, didn't you?

07:40.113 --> 07:41.590
No bungee-jumping.

07:41.663 --> 07:43.717
U.S. Marshals don't bungee-jump, Kurt.

07:43.752 --> 07:47.178
True, but it's still a very physical

07:47.264 --> 07:48.147
and dangerous job.

07:48.189 --> 07:51.498
Yeah, and she said physical
activity is good for a growing fetus.

07:51.550 --> 07:53.195
Allie, come on.

07:54.493 --> 07:56.407
You're about to be a mother.

07:57.027 --> 07:58.939
We've gotta start thinking
about the bigger picture.

07:58.978 --> 08:01.007
I am not having this conversation.

08:01.042 --> 08:03.502
I am not taking a desk job.

08:04.620 --> 08:07.716
Kurt, I love how worried you are.

08:07.800 --> 08:09.968
Sort of. But it's gonna be fine.

08:10.022 --> 08:11.665
The baby's healthy.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.725
- And hungry.
- Hmm.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.198
So, why don't you just
buy us some breakfast?

08:18.124 --> 08:19.474
Come on.

08:21.968 --> 08:23.184
Weller.

08:25.523 --> 08:27.322
What, no suit? You okay?

08:27.384 --> 08:28.298
Yeah, Borden cleared me to work,

08:28.348 --> 08:29.930
but I think I'm gonna take a personal day.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.460
All right.

08:31.542 --> 08:33.166
- Whatever you need.
- All right.

08:33.217 --> 08:35.025
Just for today, I'll be back tomorrow.

08:35.068 --> 08:36.171
Okay.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.727
All right, so what...

08:42.842 --> 08:44.877
- Nice haircut.
- Thanks.

08:45.053 --> 08:47.521
- What do you got?
- We waiting for Reade?

08:47.556 --> 08:49.565
No, he's taking the day off.

08:49.684 --> 08:52.401
Uh, this is one of the
first tattoos that I cracked.

08:52.469 --> 08:54.862
So, the numbers around
the compass correspond

08:54.921 --> 08:57.370
to the server address for Snapitz.

08:57.419 --> 08:58.796
As in the app that posts photos

08:58.843 --> 09:00.383
and then deletes them after ten seconds?

09:00.427 --> 09:03.141
Yeah, exactly, and the rest of the numbers

09:03.228 --> 09:05.403
match up to five Snapitz accounts

09:05.450 --> 09:09.008
that link up to known associates
to the most powerful crime family

09:09.071 --> 09:11.364
- in the tri-state area.
- The O'Malleys.

09:11.399 --> 09:14.137
So, the Irish mob are using
Snapitz to communicate?

09:14.189 --> 09:15.680
Well, it sure looks that way.

09:15.749 --> 09:19.176
And I got an alert last night that all
of these accounts went active again.

09:19.231 --> 09:20.906
A slew of photos were posted.

09:20.968 --> 09:22.266
Chess games?

09:22.344 --> 09:23.546
Is it some kind of code?

09:23.593 --> 09:25.565
It took my team all night to crack it.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.762
But, using endgame tablebases

09:27.840 --> 09:30.890
of chess probabilities for
the fewest moves to checkmate,

09:30.925 --> 09:33.776
we realized that the numbers
correspond to letters.

09:33.811 --> 09:36.767
So, one move here to mate equals "A,"

09:36.829 --> 09:38.775
which is the first letter of the alphabet.

09:38.810 --> 09:41.217
Two moves here equals "B," you get it.

09:41.252 --> 09:45.886
The message translates to
"Adams Park, Wednesday, Noon."

09:45.972 --> 09:48.466
There's a political rally for
immigration reform there today.

09:48.501 --> 09:50.129
Yeah, I heard about it on the news.

09:50.176 --> 09:52.691
Lots of politicians and VIPs in attendance.

09:52.763 --> 09:54.720
That could be the target
for a potential attack.

09:54.785 --> 09:57.039
It's almost noon, no time to call it off.

09:57.093 --> 09:59.551
Patterson, send in some backup. Let's move.

09:59.615 --> 10:01.611
I'll stay. Keep us informed.

10:14.784 --> 10:16.123
Let's split up.

10:16.220 --> 10:18.504
Look for anything or
anyone that's out of place.

10:18.540 --> 10:20.186
Tasha, right.

10:20.248 --> 10:22.029
Jane, left. Left side.

10:22.132 --> 10:24.614
Okay, take two right. Two left.

10:24.649 --> 10:25.917
...this very important issue...

10:25.990 --> 10:27.525
immigration reform.

10:27.579 --> 10:31.785
We all know how important it is
to this country and to all of us

10:31.820 --> 10:33.078
and around the world.

10:33.136 --> 10:35.093
We need to keep our borders open,

10:35.153 --> 10:37.777
and all of you fighting
in your own communities

10:37.847 --> 10:41.831
on this very important
issue. We thank you so much.

10:41.884 --> 10:45.021
Please welcome the distinguished
state senator Quinn Donahue.

10:50.414 --> 10:51.815
As many of you know,

10:51.883 --> 10:54.637
immigration reform is something
I hold very near to my...

10:57.840 --> 10:59.152
Get down!

11:04.037 --> 11:06.790
Where's the shooter?
Anyone got eyes on him?

11:07.028 --> 11:08.661
I can't see him!

11:16.873 --> 11:21.873
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

11:30.034 --> 11:31.358
Where's the shooter?!

11:32.831 --> 11:34.073
Wait, I think I got him!

11:34.127 --> 11:37.334
Blue plaid shirt, media box, carrying
a bag, heading north through the crowd.

11:37.458 --> 11:39.136
I don't have a shot, anyone near the stage?

11:39.185 --> 11:41.352
Negative, I'm at the south end of the park.

11:43.709 --> 11:45.052
Got him!

11:45.115 --> 11:46.093
Got him!

11:46.190 --> 11:47.522
Move! Move!

11:50.866 --> 11:52.069
On him!

11:54.180 --> 11:55.200
FBI!

11:57.447 --> 11:58.913
Let her go!

12:12.904 --> 12:15.361
Allie, what's wrong?

12:15.407 --> 12:17.139
Nothing, Tasha called me in on your case.

12:17.189 --> 12:18.488
We ID'd the shooter.

12:18.543 --> 12:21.971
Michael Herskope, a known associate
of the O'Malley crime family.

12:22.024 --> 12:23.118
Old friend of yours?

12:23.189 --> 12:24.831
Allie grew up with a bunch
of these guys and still knows

12:24.877 --> 12:26.591
some of the family...
I thought she could help.

12:26.662 --> 12:27.968
Al, what can you tell us?

12:28.003 --> 12:30.179
Well, as most people
know, the shooter's target,

12:30.214 --> 12:33.555
Senator Quinn Donahue, is first
cousins with Patrick O'Malley.

12:33.602 --> 12:35.687
O'Malley's the head of the Irish mob.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.011
Now, the senator built his career

12:37.066 --> 12:38.944
with his tough-on-crime
stance as a D.A.

12:38.994 --> 12:40.395
He put away a lot of his own relatives

12:40.459 --> 12:42.353
using intel he got
growing up in the family.

12:42.392 --> 12:44.872
But if this is a hit by the
O'Malleys, why wait until now?

12:44.912 --> 12:46.676
Patrick's little brother
just died in prison.

12:46.742 --> 12:48.597
They blame their cousin, Senator Donahue.

12:48.632 --> 12:50.898
- So, this is payback.
- It's very possible.

12:50.942 --> 12:52.719
Donahue's been bad for business for years.

12:52.763 --> 12:54.173
Killing a senator is a bold move.

12:54.212 --> 12:55.884
O'Malley's little brother just died,

12:55.919 --> 12:57.601
so I'd say he's not thinking clearly.

12:57.636 --> 12:59.945
Hey, just got ballistics.

12:59.992 --> 13:02.866
The serial number on the gun the
shooter hid inside the camera matches one

13:02.955 --> 13:04.570
registered to Patrick O'Malley.

13:04.612 --> 13:06.125
What? That makes no sense.

13:06.164 --> 13:09.264
Why would Patrick have someone use
his own gun to take Donahue out?

13:09.299 --> 13:11.817
Don't know... I'll ask him
when we have him brought in.

13:12.185 --> 13:14.179
Hey, Kurt. Let me help.

13:14.214 --> 13:15.980
- I can talk to him.
- We got this.

13:16.015 --> 13:17.217
Look, I know him. It just...

13:17.273 --> 13:20.216
I appreciate your help,
but this is an FBI case.

13:28.535 --> 13:30.076
Jones.

13:31.291 --> 13:33.084
Did he ever give you a lift home?

13:33.885 --> 13:34.952
Edgar.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.142
Was I one of 'em?

13:36.192 --> 13:37.683
Edgar, what are you...

13:39.805 --> 13:40.934
- Was I one of 'em?
- You're not making any sense...

13:40.974 --> 13:42.876
Was I one of the kids you abused?

13:42.955 --> 13:44.417
Oh, no.

13:44.496 --> 13:46.079
What are they filling your
head with, Edgar, come on...

13:46.118 --> 13:47.552
Look, I know what you
did to those other kids.

13:47.603 --> 13:48.962
I know it never ended.

13:49.020 --> 13:51.396
So, just tell me, was I one of 'em?

13:53.307 --> 13:55.630
- Sir, let him go.
- He's good.

13:55.729 --> 13:58.658
Let him go, I've already called the cops.

13:58.736 --> 14:01.561
You're not gonna get away
with this, you hear me?

14:01.688 --> 14:03.688
You'll get yours, I promise you.

14:20.668 --> 14:22.687
I'm Agent Weller. This is our consult...

14:22.722 --> 14:23.963
Save your breath.

14:23.998 --> 14:26.122
I'll only talk to one cop...

14:26.681 --> 14:28.163
Allie Knight.

14:29.508 --> 14:32.309
So... let me get this straight.

14:32.433 --> 14:33.678
You had Patrick arrested,

14:33.724 --> 14:35.637
you brought him in for interrogation,

14:35.691 --> 14:38.744
but so far you've got nothing
'cause he'll only talk to me?

14:38.822 --> 14:41.105
Why was he asking for you by name?

14:41.749 --> 14:43.575
When was the last time you saw him?

14:43.610 --> 14:45.585
I don't know, less than
a year ago at a barbecue.

14:45.644 --> 14:46.696
What?

14:46.731 --> 14:49.234
His sister Stephanie and I have
been best friends since we were kids.

14:49.286 --> 14:50.944
You are a U.S. Marshal.

14:50.979 --> 14:52.446
Yeah, and she's a teacher.

14:52.532 --> 14:55.899
Just because her family's a bunch
of criminals doesn't mean she is.

14:59.677 --> 15:00.793
All right.

15:01.875 --> 15:04.582
Let's go and see what your
friend's got to say, shall we?

15:04.617 --> 15:06.502
Hey... hey, look.

15:06.542 --> 15:08.298
I know this will probably be hard for you,

15:08.355 --> 15:10.877
but why don't you just let
me take the lead on this one?

15:11.582 --> 15:12.687
Fine.

15:17.339 --> 15:18.623
Sorry to interrupt.

15:18.658 --> 15:21.335
That's okay, just trying
to unspool space-time.

15:21.370 --> 15:23.361
- You...
- It's... never mind.

15:23.396 --> 15:24.244
What do you need?

15:24.279 --> 15:25.935
Oh, I, uh...

15:25.985 --> 15:28.574
I remembered something
from my past this morning.

15:28.609 --> 15:32.508
That belonged to a doctor who saved
my life after the Orion attack.

15:32.543 --> 15:34.270
I can't explain it,
but she feels important,

15:34.305 --> 15:36.765
and I need to find out who she was.

15:36.827 --> 15:38.809
Is there a way to track this ring?

15:38.844 --> 15:41.561
Yeah, yeah. I'll see what I can do.

15:41.650 --> 15:42.931
Thank you.

15:51.138 --> 15:53.096
Hey, Patrick. You look like crap.

15:53.131 --> 15:55.569
Yeah, cancer'll do that to you.

15:56.198 --> 15:58.845
Last round of chemo kicked my ass.

15:59.067 --> 16:01.048
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

16:01.102 --> 16:03.016
Doc says I got six months.

16:03.357 --> 16:05.444
But let's talk about somethin' good.

16:05.479 --> 16:07.969
Stephie tells me you're dating Conor again.

16:08.016 --> 16:09.002
I always liked him.

16:09.046 --> 16:10.480
He's a good neighborhood boy.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.599
Yeah, it's early, but it's going good.

16:12.641 --> 16:15.209
- We'll see.
- Your cousin, Senator Donahue...

16:16.256 --> 16:19.557
He was shot today,
along with two civilians.

16:21.903 --> 16:24.087
Busy day for law enforcement.

16:24.122 --> 16:27.374
Donahue put away your brother.

16:27.513 --> 16:28.671
He put away a lot of people.

16:28.706 --> 16:31.257
The gunman, Michael Herskope,

16:31.369 --> 16:32.674
is a known associate of yours.

16:32.729 --> 16:34.699
I have a lot of friends.
Is that all you got?

16:34.734 --> 16:38.071
No... he also used your gun.

16:38.750 --> 16:41.017
Registered to you.

16:41.072 --> 16:41.980
Who is the rookie?

16:42.015 --> 16:46.059
The rookie is the Assistant Director
of the New York Office of the FBI.

16:46.094 --> 16:48.478
You practice saying that
in front of the mirror?

16:48.513 --> 16:50.397
Patrick, this is Kurt.

16:50.603 --> 16:51.681
My Kurt.

16:51.759 --> 16:52.915
Ohh...

16:53.002 --> 16:55.395
I knew there was a
reason I didn't like him.

16:57.155 --> 16:59.184
This might be my favorite
interrogation ever.

16:59.234 --> 17:03.023
The only problem with Boy
Scout's theory here is,

17:03.058 --> 17:06.106
when I got cancer, I got out
of the family business too.

17:06.143 --> 17:07.554
Just 'cause I was born an O'Malley

17:07.608 --> 17:10.183
doesn't mean I have to
die an O'Malley, right?

17:10.230 --> 17:13.444
You think someone like that
could have a change of heart?

17:13.479 --> 17:16.663
They're a family of killers. I'm
surprised more of them don't want out.

17:16.710 --> 17:19.593
You get raised by wolves...

17:19.680 --> 17:21.761
you tend to become a wolf.

17:21.815 --> 17:24.481
No, there's... there's always a choice.

17:24.703 --> 17:27.317
So, you're telling me you
had nothing to do with this?

17:27.367 --> 17:29.053
Come on, Allie.

17:29.837 --> 17:33.626
You think that I'd be dumb enough
to use my own gun to kill Donahue?

17:33.808 --> 17:37.360
I wanted the son of a bitch
dead for a long time, but...

17:37.450 --> 17:39.401
family is family.

17:40.412 --> 17:43.061
So, who was behind the
assassination attempt?

17:43.111 --> 17:44.957
Well, think about it.

17:46.037 --> 17:48.538
Who's the new hero of New York City?

17:51.722 --> 17:53.165
Donahue?

17:53.637 --> 17:54.588
Doesn't make any sense.

17:54.638 --> 17:55.812
No, he's running for governor.

17:55.877 --> 17:56.899
It's twisted, but...

17:56.954 --> 17:59.419
It makes a hell of a front page.

17:59.618 --> 18:01.276
You catch up to the bus yet?

18:02.619 --> 18:05.258
Being ambitious is one thing.

18:05.395 --> 18:07.401
Making yourself a literal target,

18:07.464 --> 18:09.640
- a whole nother thing.
- You don't know Donahue.

18:09.690 --> 18:11.114
What if the shooter missed?

18:11.149 --> 18:13.426
Michael is a former Marine sharpshooter.

18:13.461 --> 18:17.436
He could hit a fly on a
donkey's ass from a mile out.

18:17.493 --> 18:19.175
That makes sense now why
none of the shots were lethal.

18:19.242 --> 18:20.584
He wasn't going for the kill.

18:20.639 --> 18:24.008
Okay, fine. Say it's true.

18:24.043 --> 18:26.203
How does the senator get the mob,

18:26.297 --> 18:29.665
his sworn enemy, to carry out a fake hit?

18:30.540 --> 18:33.975
Quinn Donahue is the mob.

18:34.222 --> 18:37.390
He is in charge. Always has been.

18:37.425 --> 18:38.608
What the hell are you talking about?

18:38.643 --> 18:40.657
I was the face...

18:40.722 --> 18:43.215
but I was always his loyal number two.

18:43.254 --> 18:45.832
Ever since our days back in the sandbox.

18:45.867 --> 18:48.034
So, you're telling me that
state senator Quinn Donahue

18:48.069 --> 18:50.737
is head of the Irish mob?

18:50.834 --> 18:52.383
Just wait till he's governor.

19:03.379 --> 19:06.296
Allie... Allie! He's lying.

19:06.335 --> 19:07.849
Why don't you let me talk to him alone?

19:07.896 --> 19:08.745
No.

19:08.783 --> 19:11.413
This whole alpha male pissing
contest isn't helping, Kurt.

19:11.452 --> 19:12.692
Absolutely not.

19:12.739 --> 19:14.246
He's not gonna open up with you there.

19:14.284 --> 19:16.080
What are you talking about? He just did.

19:16.115 --> 19:17.706
This is huge.

19:17.741 --> 19:19.489
I mean, if he's telling the truth,

19:19.571 --> 19:22.338
we could wipe out the entire
O'Malley crime syndicate

19:22.421 --> 19:24.566
and a corrupt senator in one fell swoop.

19:24.636 --> 19:26.575
The guy's got six months to live.

19:26.610 --> 19:29.250
Not sure we have that much leverage.

19:29.285 --> 19:32.107
We have more than we think.

19:32.142 --> 19:32.913
Hmm?

19:33.888 --> 19:35.555
You're back.

19:36.811 --> 19:38.315
I'm Jane.

19:39.005 --> 19:40.655
Hello, Jane.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.239
I've been listening,

19:42.453 --> 19:45.943
and I understand, um,

19:45.978 --> 19:47.978
you want to be loyal to your family.

19:49.865 --> 19:53.334
I struggle with that myself.

19:53.428 --> 19:58.488
But your family tried
to frame you for murder.

19:58.523 --> 20:01.260
They know you're sick,
they know how long you have,

20:01.325 --> 20:03.679
and they know you won't make bail.

20:03.742 --> 20:05.054
But they're prepared
for you to spend the rest

20:05.117 --> 20:07.801
of whatever life you have left in a cell,

20:07.883 --> 20:10.468
away from your wife and daughter.

20:10.704 --> 20:11.969
Loyalty is a noble value,

20:12.004 --> 20:14.545
but you can't let it blind
you, and when it counted,

20:14.607 --> 20:16.607
those people weren't there for you.

20:16.907 --> 20:18.563
They used you.

20:19.530 --> 20:24.066
Think I wanna spend my last days in
court, testifying against my family?

20:24.129 --> 20:27.151
You walked away from them for a reason.

20:27.257 --> 20:28.683
You said you didn't
want to die an O'Malley.

20:28.729 --> 20:30.074
You let them get away with this,

20:30.156 --> 20:32.490
that's going to be your legacy.

20:32.525 --> 20:36.109
And your daughter will
never know you took a stand.

20:39.582 --> 20:41.498
I have tapes.

20:43.814 --> 20:45.052
What tapes?

20:45.117 --> 20:46.592
Hard evidence.

20:46.792 --> 20:49.180
Everything you need to take down Donahue.

20:50.006 --> 20:51.756
And you'll hand them over?

20:51.853 --> 20:53.870
I want a plea deal.

20:54.010 --> 20:57.631
And I want lifetime witness
protection for my wife and daughter.

21:06.156 --> 21:07.074
Zapata.

21:07.109 --> 21:08.327
Hey, it's Josh.

21:08.372 --> 21:10.468
We got a complaint filed
against your partner.

21:10.524 --> 21:12.424
Guess he was harassing
some guy named Mike Jones

21:12.502 --> 21:14.196
in Brooklyn Heights this morning.

21:14.251 --> 21:15.808
Fled the scene before officers arrived.

21:15.843 --> 21:17.843
Thought you might want to know.

21:18.417 --> 21:20.133
Yeah, I'll... I'll get into it, thanks.

21:20.201 --> 21:20.975
You got it.

21:25.544 --> 21:27.535
Hey, it's Edgar. Leave a message.

21:27.570 --> 21:31.215
It's me. Where are you?
Call me when you get this.

21:32.575 --> 21:34.015
Conor?

21:34.420 --> 21:37.077
"I'm so perfect" from high school Conor?

21:37.112 --> 21:38.810
I told you he never got over you.

21:38.872 --> 21:41.892
Well, we'll see if he sticks
around once I get fat and bloated.

21:41.973 --> 21:43.521
Look, Allie...

21:44.597 --> 21:46.576
I'm not gonna lie, all right?

21:46.611 --> 21:48.767
This is... weird.

21:48.818 --> 21:49.958
Really weird.

21:50.005 --> 21:55.406
But... if you're happy, I'm happy.

21:55.612 --> 21:58.275
Well, that's some exciting
new territory for us.

22:00.309 --> 22:01.912
Patrick says the Donahue tapes are stored

22:01.947 --> 22:03.500
in his lawyer's office in Midtown.

22:03.562 --> 22:04.697
If they exist.

22:04.767 --> 22:06.693
- But there's a catch.
- Which is?

22:06.742 --> 22:10.175
They're in a safe that only opens
with a retinal and fingerprint scan.

22:10.217 --> 22:11.683
So, it's a field trip. Come on.

22:11.749 --> 22:14.815
I, uh, I got a personal
thing I need to take care of.

22:14.878 --> 22:17.261
What is this, National Personal Day?

22:17.363 --> 22:19.063
Fine, go.

22:19.121 --> 22:21.238
Patrick has enough babysitters.

22:41.954 --> 22:43.821
I'll speak to security.

22:45.457 --> 22:47.374
Can we drop the formalities?

22:48.661 --> 22:49.960
No.

22:49.995 --> 22:52.930
You're under arrest. Remember that one?

22:52.965 --> 22:56.100
He's a sick, dying man.
He's not going anywhere.

22:56.135 --> 22:57.768
Those cuffs are staying on him.

22:57.803 --> 23:00.087
That's protocol. I don't trust him.

23:01.371 --> 23:03.567
Guards are letting us up to the 57th floor.

23:03.645 --> 23:04.642
Let's go.

23:11.058 --> 23:15.077
Patrick. I got your message.

23:15.237 --> 23:17.655
It's okay, Mel.

23:17.690 --> 23:19.565
Melissa Coto, Mr.
O'Malley's attorney, why...

23:19.620 --> 23:22.730
Kurt Weller, Assistant Director of the FBI.

23:22.808 --> 23:25.045
We're here to pick up some
evidence from O'Malley's safe.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.330
Do you have a warrant?

23:26.365 --> 23:29.900
Melly... it's okay, let 'em in.

23:29.935 --> 23:31.616
Weller, the lobby.

23:31.681 --> 23:32.847
What?

23:33.679 --> 23:35.141
It's an ambush!

23:37.423 --> 23:39.924
They're here for Patrick.

23:40.045 --> 23:41.395
We're under attack.

24:06.393 --> 24:08.525
Patterson, multiple gunmen have
just walked into this building.

24:08.595 --> 24:09.858
Send us some backup, now.

24:09.929 --> 24:11.479
On it, but there's a U.N. summit going on,

24:11.542 --> 24:13.043
so response may be delayed.

24:13.078 --> 24:14.441
- These your guys?
- I told you,

24:14.487 --> 24:15.991
I dot have guys anymore.

24:16.054 --> 24:18.658
Must have been someone from
your office tipped Donahue off.

24:18.721 --> 24:20.913
- Impossible.
- He's got people everywhere.

24:20.985 --> 24:21.942
We need a plan.

24:21.978 --> 24:24.187
Jane, I want you to take
Allie and Patrick downstairs,

24:24.222 --> 24:27.024
Find somewhere safe.
Barricade yourselves, okay?

24:27.059 --> 24:29.195
Nas, you and I, we'll hold this floor.

24:29.252 --> 24:31.089
- All right, let's go.
- We gotta get the tapes first.

24:31.144 --> 24:32.324
No, it's too dangerous.

24:32.385 --> 24:34.381
If we don't get those tapes,
Donahue's guys will destroy them

24:34.424 --> 24:35.757
and we'll never get a conviction.

24:35.792 --> 24:37.308
- Allie...
- We're getting the tapes.

24:37.343 --> 24:39.987
No, Allie... Allie.

24:40.035 --> 24:41.738
Jane, Jane, hang on.

24:41.773 --> 24:43.040
Don't let them out of your sight.

24:43.091 --> 24:45.375
You stay on comms, you keep them safe.

24:45.441 --> 24:47.274
Okay? Keep them safe.

24:48.770 --> 24:49.815
All right.

24:52.669 --> 24:54.039
All right, people,

24:54.092 --> 24:55.547
gunmen have just walked into this building.

24:55.605 --> 24:57.025
So, I want you to find an office,

24:57.076 --> 24:59.622
lock the door, stay there until it's safe.

24:59.704 --> 25:01.095
Okay? Go.

25:15.774 --> 25:17.124
_

25:17.159 --> 25:20.293
No, it didn't read your print. Try again.

25:20.328 --> 25:22.988
That's weird.

25:23.023 --> 25:24.940
- If you're stalling...
- Let me try to reset it.

25:24.975 --> 25:26.226
What kind of chemo meds are you on?

25:26.261 --> 25:28.640
Uh, something called Capecitabine, why?

25:28.679 --> 25:30.087
Oh, damn it.

25:30.142 --> 25:32.100
That's why the fingerprint
sensor isn't working.

25:32.141 --> 25:34.946
One of the side-effects is a skin
condition that obscures your prints.

25:35.001 --> 25:36.898
I had a fugitive once
using it to evade capture.

25:36.948 --> 25:39.701
Look, if we can't get that
open, we should evacuate.

25:39.779 --> 25:41.123
Patterson, do you read?

25:41.158 --> 25:42.904
Is there any way to bypass a hand-scanner?

25:42.942 --> 25:44.132
Yeah, tons.

25:44.194 --> 25:45.646
In less than a minute?

25:45.745 --> 25:49.052
Uh, oh, uh, maybe one?

25:49.114 --> 25:50.390
All right, find something to knock

25:50.431 --> 25:52.154
the tumbler off with.

26:13.907 --> 26:18.710
Okay, now take that paperclip
and feel for the gears.

26:18.792 --> 26:21.743
Turn it clockwise until you hear a click.

26:22.614 --> 26:24.216
Wait...

26:24.258 --> 26:25.542
I think that just worked.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.911
Great. Okay, only two more to go.

26:27.946 --> 26:29.238
The next ones are gonna
be a little bit harder.

26:29.298 --> 26:30.284
Do you have something sharp

26:30.341 --> 26:32.308
like a knife, letter opener, something?

26:34.986 --> 26:36.597
They bypassed our floor.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.640
How many floors does this law firm have?

26:40.845 --> 26:42.328
Okay...

26:42.402 --> 26:44.335
I think that just worked.

26:47.107 --> 26:48.940
Is this all of it, Patrick?

26:48.975 --> 26:52.110
- Yeah.
- Great, let's go.

26:54.499 --> 26:56.819
Weller, we got the evidence,
we're coming back to you now.

26:56.877 --> 26:58.768
Donahue's men bypassed this floor.

26:58.839 --> 26:59.806
There could be an internal stairwell

26:59.841 --> 27:02.886
they're gonna come down...

27:11.498 --> 27:13.565
They cut us off, we can't get back to you.

27:14.746 --> 27:18.248
Don't! We're pinned down. Find an exit!

27:18.455 --> 27:20.054
Get out of the building!

27:22.317 --> 27:23.766
Where's the emergency stairwell?

27:23.829 --> 27:25.418
Uh, it's down there, to the left.

27:42.041 --> 27:44.753
Allie, you trust him?

27:47.032 --> 27:48.852
Good, uncuff him.

27:48.980 --> 27:50.610
We're gonna need all the help we can get.

27:52.647 --> 27:53.997
Ready? Move!

28:04.630 --> 28:05.675
Here.

28:06.382 --> 28:08.198
Don't make me regret this.

28:10.498 --> 28:11.965
Uhh!

28:12.000 --> 28:14.717
Okay, stay together.

28:34.137 --> 28:36.348
No, turn around, go back up. Hurry. Hurry.

28:44.199 --> 28:45.665
Aah!

28:57.153 --> 28:59.037
Aah!

29:00.032 --> 29:01.081
Ohh!

29:05.151 --> 29:06.840
You're gonna be okay. Stay with me, okay?

29:06.897 --> 29:07.825
You're gonna be okay.

29:07.878 --> 29:09.898
We gotta get out of this stairwell.

29:10.561 --> 29:11.742
You got it. Give me the keycard.

29:11.777 --> 29:13.218
- Melly.
- I can't.

29:15.932 --> 29:17.815
You tipped off Donahue?

29:19.079 --> 29:21.888
You got out. I work for him now.

29:21.950 --> 29:23.460
Why didn't you just give him the tapes?

29:23.509 --> 29:26.449
Because I... I needed
you to get into the safe.

29:26.484 --> 29:27.594
I'm sorry, Patrick.

29:27.629 --> 29:29.362
Hey, give me a hand.

29:33.345 --> 29:35.790
Get up.

29:35.891 --> 29:37.742
Wait... what are you doing?

29:43.973 --> 29:45.372
They're coming.

29:47.443 --> 29:49.676
Okay, go, go.

29:54.562 --> 29:56.023
Okay, that should hold them for a bit.

29:56.092 --> 29:57.875
Weller, Allie's been shot.

29:58.065 --> 29:59.548
What?!

29:59.632 --> 30:01.816
How badly? Allie!

30:01.851 --> 30:03.802
I'm gonna be okay, Kurt.

30:03.860 --> 30:05.518
I'm coming to ya, Allie.

30:10.447 --> 30:11.539
You're okay.

30:11.593 --> 30:13.257
We have to get out of here.

30:13.519 --> 30:16.162
I'm pregnant. It's Kurt's.

32:17.408 --> 32:19.358
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

32:19.415 --> 32:20.664
This is all on me.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.270
No, it's not your fault.

32:22.385 --> 32:23.685
Patterson!

32:23.752 --> 32:24.895
We're in the east corridor.

32:24.950 --> 32:26.237
What's the fastest way to Allie?

32:26.272 --> 32:28.888
Uh, okay, the floor they're
on is under construction,

32:28.924 --> 32:30.092
so the elevators won't go there.

32:30.150 --> 32:31.905
The quick way is down the hall,

32:31.957 --> 32:33.277
make a right, and through the stairs,

32:33.336 --> 32:34.680
but that's super dangerous.

32:34.717 --> 32:36.262
That's by the stairwell
the gunmen were using.

32:36.309 --> 32:37.164
What's the other way?

32:37.236 --> 32:38.227
The safe way is a lot longer.

32:38.285 --> 32:39.661
You're gonna have to double back.

32:39.696 --> 32:41.689
Whatever, I'm going the
quick and dangerous way!

32:41.728 --> 32:43.299
- Kurt!
- Allie...

32:43.377 --> 32:44.561
we're gonna have to
try to stop the bleeding

32:44.596 --> 32:46.896
until the paramedics get here, okay?

32:47.420 --> 32:49.639
Here, you too, I'm gonna need your help.

32:49.984 --> 32:51.182
I'm going for the stairs.

32:51.220 --> 32:52.836
No!

32:52.907 --> 32:55.250
- What... what are you...
- Listen!

32:55.285 --> 32:58.419
You're no use to Allie or
your baby if you're dead!

32:58.454 --> 33:00.421
I have an idea.

33:04.961 --> 33:06.311
You're doing so good, Allie, okay?

33:06.346 --> 33:09.221
Stay with us. Allie? Allie? Allie?

33:09.307 --> 33:12.150
Hey, how far along are you, huh?

33:12.185 --> 33:13.768
- 15 weeks.
- Yeah?

33:13.803 --> 33:16.751
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl yet?

33:16.790 --> 33:20.325
No, Kurt wanted to find
out, but I wanted a surprise.

33:20.360 --> 33:22.277
Hang in there one second.

33:22.312 --> 33:24.279
Almost there, Allie.

33:24.314 --> 33:25.651
This is going to hurt a little bit, okay,

33:25.686 --> 33:27.793
but we have to stop the bleeding, okay?

33:27.828 --> 33:29.918
Ready?

33:31.861 --> 33:33.441
Unh!

33:33.515 --> 33:35.002
Weller, concentrate.

33:35.065 --> 33:36.124
I am!

33:36.159 --> 33:37.792
Do you have a light?

33:37.827 --> 33:39.744
What? No!

33:41.297 --> 33:43.298
I got something better.

33:43.333 --> 33:44.966
On three, okay?

33:45.001 --> 33:48.169
One... two... three!

33:59.874 --> 34:01.290
They've gotten through the doors.

34:04.731 --> 34:06.761
No, they'll kill you. They'll kill you.

34:06.796 --> 34:08.289
They're gonna kill all of us.

34:08.324 --> 34:09.811
They'll find us if we don't move.

34:09.857 --> 34:10.705
We're gonna have to carry you, okay...

34:10.770 --> 34:13.070
Patrick? Patrick? Patrick!

34:18.333 --> 34:19.833
He left the evidence.

34:19.869 --> 34:21.636
We have to stop him.

34:21.670 --> 34:23.670
No, look...

34:23.706 --> 34:25.580
he bought us some time to get out of here.

34:25.614 --> 34:26.674
We gotta take it, okay?

34:26.708 --> 34:28.059
Allie, this is our only chance.

34:28.094 --> 34:29.677
We can't leave him, they'll kill him.

34:29.712 --> 34:31.512
He made this choice for you.

34:31.547 --> 34:33.289
Start thinking about your baby.

34:33.351 --> 34:34.945
Okay? You're going to come with me.

34:34.980 --> 34:36.223
We have to get to the stairs.

34:36.259 --> 34:37.417
Get up.

34:40.641 --> 34:43.524
If you want the tapes, come and get 'em!

34:43.659 --> 34:45.664
Put the case down, step away.

34:47.864 --> 34:49.522
Hands in the air.

34:58.458 --> 34:59.707
Oh, Patrick?

34:59.742 --> 35:02.159
Hang on, Allie. We have to keep going.

35:10.970 --> 35:12.586
Gah!

35:20.563 --> 35:22.430
What took you so long?

35:36.338 --> 35:37.898
We're fine.

35:37.943 --> 35:38.993
I know.

35:39.187 --> 35:41.354
The baby's fine, Kurt.

35:46.081 --> 35:48.015
If something happened to you...

35:48.050 --> 35:51.179
Something did happen,
but it's gonna be okay.

35:52.138 --> 35:54.670
Anyway, now you get your way.

35:54.725 --> 35:56.106
This gunshot wound puts me firmly

35:56.141 --> 35:57.536
on desk duty for the time being.

35:59.982 --> 36:01.282
Good.

36:01.337 --> 36:03.116
And what about you?

36:03.202 --> 36:06.233
I assume you'll be taking time
out of the field now, too, right?

36:06.362 --> 36:07.734
Why would I do that?

36:07.857 --> 36:09.701
You're gonna be a father soon.

36:09.767 --> 36:12.329
You gotta start thinking
about the bigger picture.

36:13.187 --> 36:15.792
Or does that advice only work for mothers?

36:16.070 --> 36:17.544
Well-played.

36:17.662 --> 36:21.056
I want our child to see
how much I love what I do.

36:21.091 --> 36:23.867
That I can kick ass and be an awesome mom.

36:26.136 --> 36:28.025
I want our kid to be proud,

36:28.104 --> 36:29.952
of both of us.

36:40.302 --> 36:41.768
Jane.

36:42.231 --> 36:45.258
I wanted to thank you...
for what you did today.

36:45.293 --> 36:48.608
For Allie. For me.

36:48.796 --> 36:51.772
Of course. Is she okay?

36:51.839 --> 36:54.978
Yeah, they're... both good.

36:55.030 --> 36:56.312
Good.

36:57.869 --> 37:01.088
And... and congrats, that's, heh...

37:01.161 --> 37:03.531
I always thought you'd make an amazing dad.

37:04.697 --> 37:05.989
Thank you.

37:07.162 --> 37:09.346
Wish I had that confidence.

37:09.563 --> 37:10.925
How hard can it be, right?

37:10.995 --> 37:12.591
Yeah.

37:12.654 --> 37:15.220
Anyway, thank you, Jane.

37:15.706 --> 37:17.231
Good night.

37:17.266 --> 37:19.099
Good night, Kurt.

37:30.105 --> 37:31.818
Hey! Glad I caught you.

37:31.853 --> 37:33.987
Oh... are you okay?

37:34.136 --> 37:37.290
Yeah, yeah, um... did you need me?

37:37.366 --> 37:39.626
I found some information on that ring.

37:39.705 --> 37:44.744
So, turns out it's a pretty common
trinket sold in markets all around Kabul.

37:44.814 --> 37:46.613
The one difference being the markings

37:46.648 --> 37:50.698
on the one you drew are a slight
variation on the normal tribal design.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.472
Were you able to track it?

37:52.593 --> 37:53.780
No, I'm sorry.

37:53.850 --> 37:55.545
I think it might've been a one-off.

37:55.592 --> 37:59.513
And I just couldn't find
anything that was an exact match.

37:59.888 --> 38:01.681
I know you were hoping for more.

38:01.786 --> 38:03.503
Hey, thanks for trying.

38:16.364 --> 38:18.698
Why don't we pick this up later?

38:26.628 --> 38:28.980
You've reached Oliver Kind,
please leave a message.

38:30.745 --> 38:33.763
Uh, hi, it's Jane. We, um, ahem,

38:33.798 --> 38:38.218
we met at the gala right
before all hell broke loose.

38:38.265 --> 38:39.949
Um, anyway, I was...

38:40.031 --> 38:42.250
I was just wondering if you...

38:42.757 --> 38:46.395
wanted to grab a drink
and talk about water,

38:46.430 --> 38:48.181
or other things, or...

38:48.251 --> 38:49.387
I mean, we don't have to talk about water.

38:49.448 --> 38:51.124
That was, um...

38:51.829 --> 38:54.729
anyway, uh, call me back.

39:07.025 --> 39:08.711
She's remembering things.

39:08.816 --> 39:10.467
We already knew that.

39:10.577 --> 39:13.220
They seem to be coming
with more frequency now.

39:13.277 --> 39:16.356
She asked about her rescue in Afghanistan.

39:23.465 --> 39:25.899
What did she say?

39:25.934 --> 39:27.901
- Did she remember Chris?
- Not yet.

39:27.936 --> 39:30.737
But that doesn't mean she won't.

39:30.772 --> 39:33.406
She wanted to know how she got back.

39:33.441 --> 39:35.442
I told her she stowed away on a ship.

39:35.477 --> 39:38.945
If she finds out that... we lied to her...

39:38.980 --> 39:40.771
we'll lose her trust, our whole plan!

39:40.845 --> 39:42.948
What choice did I have?

39:46.655 --> 39:48.202
Let me bring her on the mission tomorrow.

39:48.237 --> 39:49.971
No, it's too risky.

39:50.033 --> 39:53.106
She needs to start feeling
invested in what we're doing.

39:53.201 --> 39:56.846
If tomorrow's a success,
everything we need will be in place.

39:56.951 --> 39:59.398
After that, it won't
matter what she remembers.

40:01.022 --> 40:02.451
Fine.

40:14.482 --> 40:16.115
Made the evening news.

40:17.347 --> 40:20.589
_

40:22.574 --> 40:25.077
- I owe you an apology.
- For what?

40:25.152 --> 40:28.461
Being right about your baby
and the mother of your child?

40:28.496 --> 40:30.199
No apology necessary.

40:30.257 --> 40:32.252
I made bad decisions out there.

40:32.392 --> 40:33.563
You kept me in line.

40:33.638 --> 40:36.640
Well, I... I hope you'd do the same for me.

40:36.813 --> 40:39.300
Besides, I, uh, I got to
make Molotov cocktails,

40:39.335 --> 40:41.425
so everybody wins.

40:41.784 --> 40:43.437
Sorry to interrupt, but this is big.

40:43.507 --> 40:45.180
Not just big, this is...
what's bigger than...

40:45.232 --> 40:47.935
Oh, whoa, okay, okay, what is it?

40:47.970 --> 40:50.979
I decoded the black hole
image from Mayfair's USB drive.

40:51.042 --> 40:52.210
What?

40:52.245 --> 40:56.366
It was a bunch of email
communications, and, long story short,

40:56.413 --> 40:58.767
I know where Douglas Winter is.

40:58.802 --> 41:02.567
The one who exposed the NSA and
forced Carter to shut down Orion?

41:02.622 --> 41:03.900
Is there another one?

41:03.981 --> 41:06.688
Mayfair knew his location the whole time?

41:06.810 --> 41:08.847
It was in her files.

41:08.907 --> 41:11.566
So, Mayfair and Winter
were working together?

41:17.951 --> 41:21.161
_

42:06.134 --> 42:07.354
Reade?

42:10.787 --> 42:11.888
Reade?

42:16.730 --> 42:21.730
