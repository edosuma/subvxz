<i>- I can barely hear you.

03:06.172 --> 03:10.965
- Come on, boo. Hey, love.
Hey, beautiful.

03:11.034 --> 03:13.000
You look--oh, you on the phone.
I was like,

03:13.068 --> 03:14.724
"Why are you holding
a beer can to your head?

03:14.793 --> 03:17.413
- I love Bethany.
She has big old chi-chis,

03:17.482 --> 03:19.896
and she has really good,
positive energy.

03:19.965 --> 03:21.275
- So I had to have

03:21.344 --> 03:22.586
a housewarming present for you.
- You love me.

03:22.655 --> 03:23.896
- I knew...
- You could have just told me.

03:23.965 --> 03:25.275
- What you like.
- You could have just told me.

03:25.344 --> 03:26.724
- I could have just told you
from the start, huh?

03:26.793 --> 03:28.275
- You could have just said,
"I'm in love with you,

03:28.344 --> 03:29.758
so I got you what you needed."
- From everything I heard,

03:29.827 --> 03:31.551
I think I'm already in love,
so there you go.

03:31.620 --> 03:34.068
Bethany is exactly what I was
pretty much expecting.

03:34.137 --> 03:36.344
Super energetic,
nothing but positivity,

03:36.413 --> 03:37.862
and I feel like this is gonna
be great for the house.

03:39.379 --> 03:41.344
- All right. Hey, to the first
night with Bethany.

03:41.413 --> 03:42.551
Welcome.
- Whoo!

03:42.620 --> 03:44.068
- Glad to finally meet you.
Cheers.

03:44.137 --> 03:46.206
- Welcome back.
- Let's get to it, son.

03:46.275 --> 03:48.689
Game time.
- Welcome back, Bethany.

03:48.758 --> 03:50.965
- Whoo!

03:51.034 --> 03:54.137
- Oh, yes, girl.

03:54.206 --> 03:56.517
- Y'all played circle of death
with the cards?

03:56.586 --> 03:59.034
- Hell yeah. Let's go.

03:59.103 --> 04:00.379
- Each card's gonna be
something different you

04:00.448 --> 04:01.620
gotta explain about yourself.

04:01.689 --> 04:02.862
- Like a first impression?
- Yeah.

04:02.931 --> 04:04.379
A first impression
type of thing.

04:04.448 --> 04:06.172
- Circle of death it's just

04:06.241 --> 04:08.275
your first impression
of everyone.

04:08.344 --> 04:09.551
All right.

04:09.620 --> 04:11.241
- Jack.

04:11.310 --> 04:12.482
- Jump to your
first impression.

04:12.551 --> 04:14.931
- Yeah.
- About anyone.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.689
- When I med Codi
for the first time

04:16.758 --> 04:19.000
I thought
he was bougie as hell.

04:19.068 --> 04:20.482
- Well, that's true.
- And you was right.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.517
- It's, like,
and he still is, though.

04:22.586 --> 04:24.034
He still is, though.

04:24.103 --> 04:25.931
- Ace.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.517
- Yeah.
- Ask the person to your left

04:27.586 --> 04:29.551
an uncomfortable question.

04:29.620 --> 04:31.793
- What's the best Gus
you've ever [bleep]?

04:31.862 --> 04:32.896
- Wow.

04:32.965 --> 04:34.448
That's just disrespectful.

04:34.517 --> 04:36.310
- The better hunter
out of the two Guses

04:36.379 --> 04:39.586
is obviously the one that put
the big-ass rock on my finger

04:39.655 --> 04:42.206
then this big-ass belly on me.

04:42.275 --> 04:45.758
Well, I'll say, no offense,
Gus, but obviously my fiancé.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.517
- Jack. What's that?
- Jump to first impression.

04:48.586 --> 04:50.000
- I'm gonna do everybody.

04:50.068 --> 04:51.793
- Candace gets it.
She goes, "Okay.

04:51.862 --> 04:54.551
I'm not gonna tell the truth
about one person.

04:54.620 --> 04:58.379
I'ma tell it about everyone."
And I'm like, "Okay."

04:58.448 --> 05:01.655
- Everybody's first impressions
can be wrong,

05:01.724 --> 05:04.103
so my first impression
of you, Kirk, I was like,

05:04.172 --> 05:07.517
"Oh, this is the Black guy?
Okay." I'm just kidding.

05:07.586 --> 05:09.931
- Deadass. Me too. Me too.
- Wow.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.103
- Damn.

05:11.172 --> 05:12.413
- Y'all, my opinions
were so wrong.

05:12.482 --> 05:13.827
I thought Nilsa was quiet.

05:13.896 --> 05:16.034
Do y'all realize how wrong
my was? Like--

05:16.103 --> 05:18.103
- That's her point. The first
impressions are always--

05:18.172 --> 05:21.137
- Like, I thought Nilsa was
quiet. I thought Codi was gay.

05:21.206 --> 05:22.758
- Why? Really?
- You had your--

05:22.827 --> 05:23.896
you had your thing popped.

05:23.965 --> 05:25.344
I did.
I thought you was gay.

05:25.413 --> 05:27.310
I'm just gonna be honest.
I did. I'ma be honest.

05:27.379 --> 05:30.034
- No. That's fine.
- Aimee. I was like, "Damn.

05:30.103 --> 05:31.586
"She is country as

05:31.655 --> 05:33.344
I ain't never met nobody
as country as you are."

05:33.413 --> 05:35.724
- I am country.
- Like, I--no.

05:35.793 --> 05:38.068
Bitch, I ain't never met nobody
that was as country.

05:38.137 --> 05:39.206
- Hey, tell the truth.
- Like, when you said--

05:39.275 --> 05:40.620
- Tell the truth
how you said about us,

05:40.689 --> 05:42.068
what you said the last time
we played this game.

05:42.137 --> 05:42.862
You thought she was racist.
Did you not say that?

05:42.931 --> 05:44.137
'Cause we're doing that.

05:44.206 --> 05:45.724
- 'Cause you was so country.
I did, at first.

05:45.793 --> 05:47.241
Until, like, we went upstairs
and put our bags away, and--

05:47.310 --> 05:48.620
- If you gonna keep it real
with us three, then you're

05:48.689 --> 05:49.827
gonna keep it real on her.
That's all I'm saying.

05:49.896 --> 05:50.689
- I said she was--
- I had to say it.

05:50.758 --> 05:52.172
I had to bring it up.

05:52.241 --> 05:55.206
- Good night, you guys.
Come on. Let's go to bed.

05:55.275 --> 05:57.827
<i>This is getting super personal
and awkward,</i>

05:57.896 --> 05:59.724
so I need to plan my escape.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.793
- I can't believe you thought
I was racist.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.172
- At first.

06:03.241 --> 06:06.586
- Oh, that breaks my heart
that you said that.

06:06.655 --> 06:08.724
- My first impressions was
completely wrong about people.

06:08.793 --> 06:11.103
- Put that on there.
- But that's all I'm saying.

06:11.172 --> 06:12.310
Ooh, what y'all think of me?

06:12.379 --> 06:13.448
Tell me. Tell me.
Tell me what you thought.

06:13.517 --> 06:14.724
- I thought you was
a tennis player.

06:14.793 --> 06:15.793
I thought you was an...
- Oh, girl, no.

06:15.862 --> 06:17.241
- Athlete.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.586
- I ain't no tennis player.
- No negative

06:18.655 --> 06:19.931
I was just happy to see
another Black folk,

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
but obviously, she wasn't
happy to see me then.

06:21.068 --> 06:22.482
- Oh, my God. Okay, so he's

06:22.551 --> 06:23.862
taking it personal.
It's not like that.

06:23.931 --> 06:24.896
- I did take
that personal, Candace.

06:24.965 --> 06:26.206
- It's not personal.

06:26.275 --> 06:27.482
- You said,
"This is the Black guy. Next."

06:27.551 --> 06:28.793
Like, come on.
What the was that?

06:28.862 --> 06:30.241
- I didn't know what to think.
- I got you.

06:30.310 --> 06:31.344
- I really didn't know...
- I'm not mad or nothing.

06:31.413 --> 06:32.517
- What to think.

06:32.586 --> 06:33.620
- I'm gonna get something
to drink for me.

06:33.689 --> 06:35.068
- Okay.
What did you think of me?

06:35.137 --> 06:36.379
- I just thought you were
educated,

06:36.448 --> 06:37.586
'cause you're well-spoken,
and I was like...

06:37.655 --> 06:38.931
- I am. I am well-spoken.
- "All right.

06:39.000 --> 06:39.758
She definitely went to college
or something,"

06:39.827 --> 06:40.931
'cause none of us are.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.379
We don't know
how to talk.

06:42.448 --> 06:44.206
- First impression
I was like...

06:44.275 --> 06:48.724
- In love.

06:50.551 --> 06:52.827
- You don't even
remember me, bitch.

06:52.896 --> 06:55.827
- Honestly, I'ma be honest.
You didn't have anything

06:55.896 --> 06:57.758
that stood out yet, but then
after I got to know you...

06:57.827 --> 06:59.137
- Oh, okay.
- And then, like,

06:59.206 --> 07:00.862
you started talking--I mean
I'm being honest.

07:00.931 --> 07:03.206
- Well, it's fine. Be honest.
- No, I am.

07:03.275 --> 07:05.275
I just--when I first
come into the house,

07:05.344 --> 07:06.827
and I heard you talk,
I was, "Oh,

07:06.896 --> 07:09.068
Okay, now she's from Alabama.
I'm from South Carolina.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.931
Okay. We kind of--we
might can get along."

07:11.000 --> 07:12.517
- You wanted to date her.

07:12.586 --> 07:15.379
You know you wanted to
her, and I ain't mad at it.

07:15.448 --> 07:16.758
I'm not tripping,

07:16.827 --> 07:18.344
but it's just the fact
that you know it's true.

07:18.413 --> 07:19.586
- We just kind of clicked.

07:19.655 --> 07:20.896
- And you settled for
the Black girl,

07:20.965 --> 07:24.448
because that--you thought
that I would go for you.

07:26.482 --> 07:29.206
- That's an argument you're not
trying to have right now,

07:29.275 --> 07:30.896
<i>'cause Candace gonna turn up.</i>

07:30.965 --> 07:33.551
- That's not true at all.
- That's your perception.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.241
Don't say he settled
for the Black girl.

07:35.310 --> 07:36.931
- But that's what it was.
He settled for the Black girl.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.758
- No. I don't feel like--
- That's not true at all.

07:38.827 --> 07:41.241
- It's the truth.
It's the truth.

07:41.310 --> 07:45.896
<i>♪ ♪</i>

07:45.965 --> 07:47.896
- You were also inviting
your sister this time.

07:47.965 --> 07:49.137
- No,
this stupid

07:49.206 --> 07:50.896
- No, I look back--
- Gus, stop.

07:50.965 --> 07:52.103
- No. Gus, come on.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.344
This is what
we're talking about.

07:53.413 --> 07:55.689
- Whoa!

07:55.758 --> 07:57.448
- Watching Candace and Bethany
wrestle

07:57.517 --> 08:00.931
on the slip-n-slide right now
it's like...

08:01.000 --> 08:02.275
I'll be right out.

08:02.344 --> 08:04.482
<i>- This is looking really
ebony and ivory.</i>

08:04.551 --> 08:08.034
I'm like, "Okay. All right.
I'm for it."

08:08.103 --> 08:09.310
- This is fun.

08:09.379 --> 08:10.689
Aw!

08:15.034 --> 08:16.103
- You settled
for the Black girl,

08:16.172 --> 08:17.448
'cause you couldn't get Aimee.

08:17.517 --> 08:18.551
- All right, I settled.
- I think that that's...

08:18.620 --> 08:19.620
- Just admit it.
- Way too much.

08:19.689 --> 08:20.793
- Okay.
- It's the truth.

08:20.862 --> 08:21.689
- That's not a
settlement, though.

08:21.758 --> 08:23.241
- All right.

08:23.310 --> 08:25.827
- Girl, why it matter
about Codi wanting to date you?

08:25.896 --> 08:28.724
You don't want him.
You never wanted him.

08:28.793 --> 08:31.586
- I mean, I don't understand
how's I can explain myself.

08:31.655 --> 08:34.103
- What she's saying is that
from her perspective

08:34.172 --> 08:36.551
as a Black woman
it's more difficult.

08:36.620 --> 08:38.034
Black women don't get
the privilege

08:38.103 --> 08:39.241
of preference like Black men.

08:39.310 --> 08:40.965
- We don't!
- You're gonna get--

08:41.034 --> 08:43.482
- It's automatically,
"If you want me..."

08:43.551 --> 08:44.793
I should want you back.

08:44.862 --> 08:46.655
- And that's how--that's
our perspective.

08:46.724 --> 08:48.896
<i>- Bethany is like
a translator for me.</i>

08:48.965 --> 08:51.586
She's able to say things
in such a really great way,

08:51.655 --> 08:53.793
and it doesn't always
come out the best for me.

08:53.862 --> 08:56.620
- Y'all need to kind of
sometimes handle Candace

08:56.689 --> 08:59.551
with gloves
that are a little bit softer,

08:59.620 --> 09:01.379
because as a Black woman,

09:01.448 --> 09:03.758
we're fighting sexism
and racism.

09:03.827 --> 09:05.655
No one else
is gonna understand it.

09:05.724 --> 09:08.379
He's only fighting racism.
She's only fighting sexism.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.344
Y'all are white men. Y'all are
at the top of the totem pole.

09:10.413 --> 09:11.827
- Thank you.
- So what...

09:11.896 --> 09:13.448
- I do understand where Candace
is coming from now,

09:13.517 --> 09:15.448
especially the way that
Bethany explained it to me.

09:15.517 --> 09:17.724
<i>Like, fact of the matter is,
is, Candace has a hard time</i>

09:17.793 --> 09:19.379
expressing her feelings too.

09:19.448 --> 09:21.896
She usually is the tough girl
when you ask her what's wrong.

09:21.965 --> 09:23.689
"No, I'm good. No, I'm good."

09:23.758 --> 09:27.517
- When it comes to stress
or heartache or anything

09:27.586 --> 09:30.275
she is the--she's in the worst
predicament as far as...

09:30.344 --> 09:31.827
- The worst position.
- Society.

09:31.896 --> 09:33.793
- At this point, I feel like
we cracked through that

09:33.862 --> 09:36.137
a little bit, and she was
finally able to open up.

09:36.206 --> 09:38.551
- I actually have
a harder time here...

09:38.620 --> 09:39.551
- But--
- But I have to put on

09:39.620 --> 09:41.551
a bigger
smile than anybody else,

09:41.620 --> 09:43.517
'cause the minute
that I have an attitude...

09:43.586 --> 09:44.517
- You are...
- Oh, bitch.

09:44.586 --> 09:45.827
- An angry Black woman.

09:45.896 --> 09:47.482
- It is a motherriot
in this place.

09:47.551 --> 09:49.448
- Well, if I have ever--
- And no one gets it.

09:49.517 --> 09:50.758
- I am sorry for that.

09:50.827 --> 09:52.241
- I don't need an apology,
Codi.

09:52.310 --> 09:55.620
It's just that that
right there, Codi, is an issue.

09:55.689 --> 09:57.482
It's not an--I don't
need an apology.

09:57.551 --> 09:59.241
It's just the matter of the
fact that, like, I get it.

09:59.310 --> 10:00.586
- Well, how can I fix it?
- No.

10:00.655 --> 10:02.241
- How can I fix it?
- Can you listen to me?

10:02.310 --> 10:03.310
- Can you actually...

10:03.379 --> 10:04.758
- Okay yeah.
- Listen to me?

10:04.827 --> 10:06.172
What I'm saying is that
it's not about an apology.

10:06.241 --> 10:07.896
I don't need an apology
from anybody.

10:07.965 --> 10:10.551
I really don't.
There's a lack of understanding

10:10.620 --> 10:13.275
for what I have to go through
on a daily basis.

10:13.344 --> 10:14.862
- All Codi wants is you
to explain to him...

10:14.931 --> 10:16.379
- What he can do to fix this.
- All your own basis. Yeah.

10:16.448 --> 10:17.896
- What can he--
- That's all I need to know.

10:17.965 --> 10:20.517
- They need to know what they
can do as white people.

10:20.586 --> 10:23.827
<i>- I'm happy to let a whole lot
off my chest,</i>

10:23.896 --> 10:27.827
to let them know
exactly how I'm feeling

10:27.896 --> 10:32.586
and why they may feel like
there's a wall up with me.

10:32.655 --> 10:33.931
Let me use an example

10:34.000 --> 10:35.827
for somebody
that's completely opposite me.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.827
Gus is a white male, right?
When I realized

10:38.896 --> 10:41.379
that I was being inconsiderate
about his toe

10:41.448 --> 10:43.448
I started asking questions
about his toe.

10:43.517 --> 10:45.758
You started opening up
about your toe. Did you not?

10:45.827 --> 10:48.379
- Yeah, I did.
- All right, a little too much.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.034
- How's your toe?

10:50.103 --> 10:52.758
- You never saw the original
X-ray of it, did you?

10:52.827 --> 10:53.965
- No.
No, I actually did not know...

10:54.034 --> 10:55.137
- You need to see it.

10:55.206 --> 10:56.310
- It was that bad
until you pulled it out.

10:56.379 --> 10:58.862
- It shattered in, like,
eight pieces.

10:58.931 --> 11:01.965
- Damn.
So what was that a result?

11:02.034 --> 11:04.827
'Cause I asked questions.
You understand what I'm saying?

11:04.896 --> 11:08.206
So you thought you had
a perception that I cared,

11:08.275 --> 11:09.655
because I asked questions.
- Yeah.

11:09.724 --> 11:11.482
If you put in the effort to,
like, actually ask...

11:11.551 --> 11:12.724
- The effort to ask questions.
- What's wrong or--yeah.

11:12.793 --> 11:13.793
Yeah, for sure.
- So when you feeling

11:13.862 --> 11:14.862
some type of way...
- So...

11:14.931 --> 11:15.689
- You want them
to ask questions?

11:15.758 --> 11:17.275
- Sometimes questions,

11:17.344 --> 11:20.379
because questions is attributed
to somebody that cares.

11:20.448 --> 11:23.620
Now, I can honestly say Aimee
will ask me how I'm feeling.

11:23.689 --> 11:27.103
Things like that. That's not
the case for everybody in here,

11:27.172 --> 11:28.310
and I understand.

11:28.379 --> 11:29.827
I don't do that
for everybody here,

11:29.896 --> 11:31.206
and I haven't always done that
for Gus, 'cause y'all...

11:31.275 --> 11:32.689
- Was about to say.

11:32.758 --> 11:34.068
- You know me and Gus--
- I didn't want to--so last

11:34.137 --> 11:35.275
summer or last vacation...
- No. You're right.

11:35.344 --> 11:36.448
- Nobody asked me
how the I felt.

11:36.517 --> 11:37.275
- And you're right,
but, Gus,

11:37.344 --> 11:38.586
you have to understand me

11:38.655 --> 11:39.724
and you ain't never liked
each other, and so--

11:39.793 --> 11:41.103
- And didn't I say
that wasn't true?

11:41.172 --> 11:42.862
I said I've never had
a problem with Candace.

11:42.931 --> 11:44.655
I never got why
you didn't like me.

11:44.724 --> 11:46.068
- You treat me so differently

11:46.137 --> 11:47.344
than you treat Aimee
and the other people.

11:47.413 --> 11:49.103
- Please tell me how. Please.

11:49.172 --> 11:50.655
- Oh, here we go.
- Oh, my God, Gus.

11:50.724 --> 11:51.862
- I'm saying y'all haven't had
a real conversation.

11:51.931 --> 11:53.068
- Hold on, Gus.
- I would like to hear--

11:53.137 --> 11:54.344
I really would like
to hear how.

11:54.413 --> 11:55.793
- Hold on, Gus.
Please. Let's go there.

11:55.862 --> 11:57.896
You treat Aimee--
you will talk to Aimee.

11:57.965 --> 12:00.724
You will talk to Nilsa and
will literally ignore me, Gus,

12:00.793 --> 12:02.448
so what do you think
I'm supposed to take--

12:02.517 --> 12:04.000
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

12:04.068 --> 12:05.827
- No, and let me say, in St.
Pete, when you got into it,

12:05.896 --> 12:09.310
I think it was with Codi.
You went upstairs by yourself.

12:09.379 --> 12:10.620
Who was the one that came out
of the bathroom and said,

12:10.689 --> 12:12.310
"Candace, are you good?"
I know what it's like...

12:12.379 --> 12:13.689
- You did.
- To feel alone in this house.

12:13.758 --> 12:14.896
I don't want you
to feel that way.

12:14.965 --> 12:16.413
- All people to come
and check on me

12:16.482 --> 12:18.586
I honestly didn't expect it
to be you, and that's crazy.

12:18.655 --> 12:19.586
Thank you
for coming to check...

12:19.655 --> 12:20.793
- Yeah. I got you.
- On me.

12:20.862 --> 12:22.068
I really appreciate you.
- Are you okay?

12:22.137 --> 12:22.965
- But, Gus,
have I not tried sometimes...

12:23.034 --> 12:24.206
- Candace...
- On you?

12:24.275 --> 12:25.275
- You just said
I've never done that.

12:25.344 --> 12:26.862
I just showed you
where I did that.

12:26.931 --> 12:28.344
Candace's logic
about how we both

12:28.413 --> 12:29.862
don't like each other
makes no sense.

12:29.931 --> 12:32.241
Like, I've literally
gave multiple examples.

12:32.310 --> 12:33.551
I'm sorry for the things
I said to you.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.275
- Gus, I have no--I
don't--at this point,

12:35.344 --> 12:36.586
I apologize for...
- And I apologize too.

12:36.655 --> 12:37.862
- What I said,
and that's not right.

12:37.931 --> 12:40.827
- It's completely unacceptable
for a man

12:40.896 --> 12:42.413
to put a hand on a woman.

12:42.482 --> 12:45.275
- I appreciate
how much y'all care.

12:45.344 --> 12:47.068
- And it just, like,
doesn't resonate at all,

12:47.137 --> 12:49.517
so I don't really think there's
anything I can say to make her,

12:49.586 --> 12:51.862
like, see that, like, "Yo,
Candace, I do care about you."

12:51.931 --> 12:54.068
Like, you're a roommate
just like everybody else.

12:54.137 --> 12:55.448
- Listen, I'm just be real.

12:55.517 --> 12:57.137
Your sister called
and threatened me.

12:57.206 --> 12:59.172
<i>- I'm just lettin' you know
if anything happens</i>

12:59.241 --> 13:00.344
<i>to my brother,
I'm gonna personally beat</i>

13:00.413 --> 13:01.896
<i>your [bleep].</i>

13:01.965 --> 13:03.896
- Don't you ever call
and threaten me again, bitch.

13:03.965 --> 13:06.000
And you also invited
your sister this time.

13:06.068 --> 13:07.172
- That's my sister.

13:07.241 --> 13:08.586
- I understand
that's your sister.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.310
I'm not taking away
from that being your sister.

13:10.379 --> 13:13.000
I'm just saying she did call
and threaten me.

13:13.068 --> 13:14.448
- I mean, Hannah does need
to apologize,

13:14.517 --> 13:15.793
just for coming off,
like, brash

13:15.862 --> 13:17.793
to Candace last vacation,
but I mean, it was really

13:17.862 --> 13:19.482
just because she was
being protective over me.

13:19.551 --> 13:21.724
<i>The bond that me
and my siblings have,</i>

13:21.793 --> 13:23.620
<i>like, we're so protective
over each other.</i>

13:23.689 --> 13:25.172
<i>We take care of each other
more than anything</i>

13:25.241 --> 13:28.413
<i>you'll ever notice
or ever see. It's crazy.</i>

13:28.482 --> 13:29.793
No. this stupid

13:29.862 --> 13:31.068
No. I look back--
- Gus, stop.

13:31.137 --> 13:32.206
- And there's no more. No.
Gus, come on.

13:32.275 --> 13:33.379
- Gus, come on.

13:33.448 --> 13:34.551
- This is what
we're talking about.

13:34.620 --> 13:35.758
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no. Come back.

13:35.827 --> 13:36.965
Come back.
- No. Gus, absolutely not.

13:37.034 --> 13:39.000
- A perfect setup.
Now they can talk.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.551
<i>- Sometimes it's better to,
like,</i>

13:40.620 --> 13:42.551
once you feel yourself getting
worked up, take a breather,

13:42.620 --> 13:44.310
go outside and, like,
decompress a little bit

13:44.379 --> 13:46.379
before you start letting, like,
the first initial thing

13:46.448 --> 13:48.241
you think
just spew out of your mouth.

13:48.310 --> 13:49.862
- Gus, no, no, no.
- No. I don't want to talk.

13:49.931 --> 13:50.896
- You're not gonna do this.
- I really don't want to talk.

13:50.965 --> 13:52.034
- Stop, Gus.

13:52.103 --> 13:52.965
- I don't want
to talk right now.

13:53.034 --> 13:54.517
- No. Talk. For real. Talk--

13:54.586 --> 13:55.724
- I just told--no. Please.
- But I'm saying, Gus...

13:55.793 --> 13:56.689
- I don't want
to get worked up.

13:56.758 --> 13:58.310
I don't want to cause--

13:58.379 --> 13:59.344
- If we're gonna--you said
you wanted to talk out.

13:59.413 --> 14:00.827
Talk out, Gus.

14:00.896 --> 14:01.862
- I don't want
to talk right now.

14:01.931 --> 14:03.172
- Are you serious?

14:03.241 --> 14:04.517
- Yeah. I'm deadass.
I really don't want to...

14:04.586 --> 14:05.482
- When I'm sitting here
trying to make [bleep]--

14:05.551 --> 14:07.689
- Talk anyhow.
- Okay.

14:10.448 --> 14:11.379
- Candace, I don't want to
talk.

14:11.448 --> 14:12.862
- but I'm saying--
- Please.

14:12.931 --> 14:14.413
I don't want to get worked up.
I don't want to talk.

14:14.482 --> 14:15.241
- If we're gonna--you said
you wanted to talk out.

14:15.310 --> 14:16.379
Talk out, Gus.

14:16.448 --> 14:17.620
- I don't want to talk
right now.

14:17.689 --> 14:18.586
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. I'm deadass.

14:18.655 --> 14:20.068
- Okay.

14:20.137 --> 14:22.000
- A perfect setup.
Now they can talk.

14:22.068 --> 14:24.896
- Nah. that.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.655
- I'm not chasing after that

14:26.724 --> 14:28.689
- Candace, you were the one
to bring up the sister [bleep],

14:28.758 --> 14:31.482
so you knew that was
gonna get it popping.

14:31.551 --> 14:32.793
- I literally chased after him.

14:32.862 --> 14:34.620
I said, "You're not gonna
talk to me

14:34.689 --> 14:36.034
when I'm trying
to make work."

14:36.103 --> 14:38.068
I'm trying to make
reason of everything.

14:38.137 --> 14:39.586
- Hello.
- Hey.

14:39.655 --> 14:43.793
- You don't want to talk
about this [bleep]? All right.

14:43.862 --> 14:45.206
<i>- Your girl's confused.</i>

14:45.275 --> 14:48.206
Gus seemed cool, but, like,
he got a hot-ass temper.

14:48.275 --> 14:50.862
My girl's too drunk
to say her points clearly.

14:50.931 --> 14:53.137
<i>She keep going in a circle,
and I'm like,</i>

14:53.206 --> 14:55.137
"How do we move this forward?"

14:55.206 --> 14:56.551
- I ain't mad about nothing.

14:56.620 --> 14:58.068
Like, it's just like
I don't even know

14:58.137 --> 14:59.344
why he got up and left.
Like--

14:59.413 --> 15:00.586
- I feel like he didn't
get upset till...

15:00.655 --> 15:01.620
- Bro.
- His sister was brought up.

15:01.689 --> 15:03.137
- But that's okay.

15:03.206 --> 15:04.896
His sister was the that
who called and threatened me

15:04.965 --> 15:07.482
about him running away.
She did that

15:07.551 --> 15:08.931
<i>- I'm just letting you know</i>

15:09.000 --> 15:10.275
<i>if anything
happens to my brother,</i>

15:10.344 --> 15:11.620
<i>I'ma personally beat
your ass.</i>

15:11.689 --> 15:13.206
- You calling me.
Going off on me.

15:13.275 --> 15:15.275
Don't you ever call
and threaten me again, bitch.

15:15.344 --> 15:16.758
You can't whup my ass.

15:16.827 --> 15:19.655
- I thought y'all were--
- No, 'cause she's coming.

15:19.724 --> 15:21.620
<i>- I can't help it.
I'm a natural peacemaker.</i>

15:21.689 --> 15:23.379
<i>Like, I want everybody
to have good times,</i>

15:23.448 --> 15:26.275
but, like, you know,
bringing up old doesn't

15:26.344 --> 15:29.068
always make everything popping.
You have a brother,

15:29.137 --> 15:31.965
and you know you'd cut
a bitch over your brother.

15:32.034 --> 15:33.758
- Mm-hmm.
- So what I'm saying to you...

15:33.827 --> 15:35.103
- And would never say
about my brother.

15:35.172 --> 15:37.206
- Can you give Gus the option
to be like,

15:37.275 --> 15:39.724
"Hey, your sister
really pissed me off.

15:39.793 --> 15:41.724
"Really hurt me.
She needs to come in this bitch

15:41.793 --> 15:44.310
apologizing,
so it don't get to that."

15:44.379 --> 15:46.034
- That's it. That's all it is.

15:46.103 --> 15:48.896
- If she apologizes and says,
"Straight up, I was wrong.

15:48.965 --> 15:50.551
I came at you the wrong way.
I'm sorry."

15:50.620 --> 15:52.896
She come in the gate like that,
are you okay?

15:52.965 --> 15:55.275
- She would have to come
in the gate like that.

15:55.344 --> 15:58.103
I mean, like, come
in the--I mean, literally.

15:58.172 --> 15:59.689
- In the door.
- She can make that door.

15:59.758 --> 16:01.103
None of that
No.

16:01.172 --> 16:02.965
The [bleep]?
You gonna call and threaten me?

16:03.034 --> 16:05.310
- All right. Cool. Fine.
- Just so you know. Never.

16:05.379 --> 16:07.586
Me? No.

16:07.655 --> 16:10.241
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:10.310 --> 16:12.344
<i>- Me and Gus are kind of alike
in that, like,</i>

16:12.413 --> 16:14.137
<i>when we feel a certain way
we feel a certain way.</i>

16:14.206 --> 16:15.655
But still, at the same time,
your sister trying

16:15.724 --> 16:17.793
to set me up,
and I don't that.

16:17.862 --> 16:19.896
- All Candace need is
some support, y'all.

16:19.965 --> 16:21.517
- What y'all say?

16:21.586 --> 16:22.931
- She be clowning, 'cause she
feel like she ain't supported.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.275
- I'm clowning because somebody

16:25.344 --> 16:27.172
bringing their sister here
to whoop my ass, and, like--

16:27.241 --> 16:28.827
- And, bitch,
I always got your back.

16:28.896 --> 16:30.172
Like, I want you to know...
- I know.

16:30.241 --> 16:31.482
- I always got you back.
- Yeah.

16:31.551 --> 16:33.896
- Like, my comments earlier
were just because

16:33.965 --> 16:36.448
I wanted you to--I
was--I didn't

16:36.517 --> 16:38.310
feel like you were properly
articulating yourself

16:38.379 --> 16:39.793
when it came
to what you said about Codi.

16:39.862 --> 16:41.379
I just wanted the specifics...
- Oh, sorry, Candace.

16:41.448 --> 16:44.103
- Of what he actually said,
versus what's interpreted,

16:44.172 --> 16:46.103
because what someone actually
said is something

16:46.172 --> 16:47.724
that you have
to hold them accountable for.

16:47.793 --> 16:48.896
- But, you know...
- No. Codi has not said--

16:48.965 --> 16:51.965
- We also interpret
people's words...

16:52.034 --> 16:53.137
- Yeah, because saying--
- Differently.

16:53.206 --> 16:54.724
- Exactly. Like, the fact
that, like,

16:54.793 --> 16:56.413
if it ever got out that, like,

16:56.482 --> 16:58.137
he "settled
for the Black girl,"

16:58.206 --> 17:00.344
and that's what he said,
that's like--

17:00.413 --> 17:02.275
- I didn't say
that he said that.

17:02.344 --> 17:04.655
- I thought he actually said
that. I'm on the outside...

17:04.724 --> 17:05.862
- And that's what
she trying to--

17:05.931 --> 17:07.172
- Looking in, and that's why--
- No.

17:07.241 --> 17:08.344
He did not actually say that.
No he didn't.

17:08.413 --> 17:09.551
- That's the only reason
why I was like...

17:09.620 --> 17:10.862
- No.
- "Hold up, bitch."

17:10.931 --> 17:12.758
- Codi has always said
that he likes all women.

17:12.827 --> 17:14.000
- And, you know--
- I have always said that.

17:14.068 --> 17:16.068
- Yeah. He's always said that.

17:16.137 --> 17:19.206
Codi's a little different.
He's the least of my problems.

17:19.275 --> 17:21.241
I'm not trying to go
I'm sorry.

17:21.310 --> 17:22.724
All I'm saying is that,

17:22.793 --> 17:27.103
look, I have different
experiences, right?

17:27.172 --> 17:30.413
<i>- I don't know what it's like
to be Black in America.</i>

17:30.482 --> 17:31.724
Nor do I know
what it's like to be

17:31.793 --> 17:33.379
a Black female in America.

17:33.448 --> 17:36.344
However, I do sympathize,
and I can have empathy

17:36.413 --> 17:40.103
for the way they are treated
differently in this country.

17:40.172 --> 17:43.103
- She has always, since she's
been a part of this,

17:43.172 --> 17:45.965
not felt enough support
from you all.

17:46.034 --> 17:47.241
That has been my general...

17:47.310 --> 17:49.241
- That's true.
- General feeling, and I--

17:49.310 --> 17:50.724
- And I don't ever want you
to feel like that.

17:50.793 --> 17:53.896
- Girl, every Black woman
feels that way in America.

17:53.965 --> 17:55.655
- I don't want them
to feel like that.

17:55.724 --> 17:56.862
- Aimee, you're
one of my best friends...

17:56.931 --> 17:58.448
- I know that.
- Outside this house.

17:58.517 --> 17:59.655
- You're my best friend, and I
hate that you feel like that.

17:59.724 --> 18:00.655
- I don't even have
another, like--

18:00.724 --> 18:02.310
- That bothers me. I hate that.

18:02.379 --> 18:03.931
- It just feels, like, really,
really good to just kind of,

18:04.000 --> 18:07.137
like, let all of this off,
on the table,

18:07.206 --> 18:11.137
and just let them know
exactly how I'm feeling.

18:11.206 --> 18:14.551
Aimee, I'm not--you
make--you are not the issue.

18:14.620 --> 18:15.896
- I know I'm not.

18:15.965 --> 18:18.103
- You make me feel validated
every single day.

18:18.172 --> 18:19.620
It's just like the person

18:19.689 --> 18:21.103
that needs to get that
is not out here...

18:21.172 --> 18:22.448
- Well, wait, wait, wait--
- So I'm sorry.

18:22.517 --> 18:25.206
My irritation with Gus
is that you're the one

18:25.275 --> 18:27.310
that's inviting your sister
that's threatening me.

18:27.379 --> 18:29.758
You ought to know
that that's gonna be an issue.

18:29.827 --> 18:31.931
Like, I get
she's your blood family,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.620
but we're also living with you,
and your sister threatened me.

18:34.689 --> 18:36.379
There's no way that
you could have thought

18:36.448 --> 18:37.827
<i>that was gonna be cool
with me.</i>

18:37.896 --> 18:39.137
Like, yeah, I'm gonna be like,
"Oh, yeah.

18:39.206 --> 18:41.931
"Hey, Gus' sister
that threatened me

18:42.000 --> 18:44.379
when we were out trying
to look for your brother."

18:44.448 --> 18:46.379
Like, there's no way
that you could have thought

18:46.448 --> 18:49.931
that that was gonna be cool.
That's common sense.

19:14.172 --> 19:15.413

19:18.551 --> 19:22.758
Yo, open the door.

19:22.827 --> 19:24.862
First off, Gus,
Candace is gonna see

19:24.931 --> 19:26.413

19:26.482 --> 19:27.620

"You ain't said a word to me
this whole trip."

19:33.206 --> 19:34.586
The did that come from?

19:34.655 --> 19:36.551
That's a lie you
just pulled out of your butt.

19:36.620 --> 19:38.379
I didn't want to sit there
and argue with Candace

19:38.448 --> 19:40.275
about
that wasn't even true.

19:40.344 --> 19:41.620
<i>Like, I'm trying to be
the better person.</i>

19:41.689 --> 19:43.241
They're still harping

and my family have said

19:45.206 --> 19:46.655
or whatever.

19:46.724 --> 19:48.137

Hey, I know what you're saying.

19:48.206 --> 19:50.206
- I don't even know
how my sister conversation

19:50.275 --> 19:51.586
got brought up into it.

19:51.655 --> 19:52.931
That literally had nothing
to do with anything.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.551
You're always gonna
take your family's side

19:54.620 --> 19:56.000
whether your family's
in the right or the wrong.

19:56.068 --> 19:57.482

with your family,

19:57.551 --> 19:58.758
you're gonna
with them back.

19:58.827 --> 20:00.517
My sister's not even here
to defend herself.

20:00.586 --> 20:01.655
- Sometimes Candace gets drunk,

20:01.724 --> 20:03.103
and she just likes
to argue, bro.

20:03.172 --> 20:05.413
That's when you just walk away
and say it.

20:05.482 --> 20:07.689
I avoided it every
time I came here.

20:07.758 --> 20:09.275
- That's what I've been
trying to do.

20:09.344 --> 20:11.137

brings into the house

30:47.413 --> 30:48.827
I don't know
where she gets that from.

30:48.896 --> 30:50.551
I really have no idea
where Candace gets that from.

30:50.620 --> 30:52.724
Like, I understand that we've
had arguments in this house,

30:52.793 --> 30:54.172
but, like, dude,

30:54.241 --> 30:55.241
I've had arguments
with everybody in this house.

30:55.310 --> 30:56.827
That don't mean
I don't like 'em.

30:56.896 --> 30:58.448
I just hated it, 'cause, like,
we were just doing so good,

30:58.517 --> 31:00.000
and then it just like--I felt
like it came out of left field.

31:00.068 --> 31:01.586
I was like, "Damn."
Like, I've been trying to be--

31:01.655 --> 31:03.275
- It did, so I'ma tell you
where it came from.

31:03.344 --> 31:04.586
- Yeah.

31:04.655 --> 31:05.965
- 100%. So I walked past,
in the living room.

31:06.034 --> 31:08.137
I heard you talk
about your sister.

31:08.206 --> 31:10.310
I do still feel some type
of way about your sister

31:10.379 --> 31:11.448
calling with the bull

31:11.517 --> 31:13.000
- And that's fair.
I would feel--

31:13.068 --> 31:14.172
- You know what I'm saying?
- If your brother called me

31:14.241 --> 31:15.413
on some
like that,

31:15.482 --> 31:16.517
- Yeah.
- I'ma be just as hot as you.

31:16.586 --> 31:17.241
- Yeah.
- So, like, I get it.

31:17.310 --> 31:18.551
I get it 100%.

31:18.620 --> 31:20.137
<i>My sister's honestly
a good person.</i>

31:20.206 --> 31:21.448
<i>And she's got a good heart,
but at the same time,</i>

31:21.517 --> 31:22.896
she's very protective,
and that's why things got

31:22.965 --> 31:25.172
as south as they did
with that whole situation.

31:25.241 --> 31:27.551
<i>And unfortunately,
Candace got the wrath of it.</i>

31:27.620 --> 31:29.000
She's protective over me,
of course.

31:29.068 --> 31:30.275
Like, that's family,
but I told her. I was like...

31:30.344 --> 31:31.482
- Same way I am with my
little brother.

31:31.551 --> 31:32.931
- Exactly.
- I get family.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.586
I'm from the South too.
- And but I told her.

31:34.655 --> 31:36.517
I was like, "Yo, like,
me and Candace might have had

31:36.586 --> 31:37.965
a little bit of riffs last
year for whatever reason,

31:38.034 --> 31:39.586
but, like, as of now,
like, we're good."

31:39.655 --> 31:40.758
- Yeah.
- So, like, any energy

31:40.827 --> 31:42.000
that might have
been there then...

31:42.068 --> 31:43.586
- Yeah.
- It's not like that now.

31:43.655 --> 31:45.275
- Listen, if they give
each other a hug,

31:45.344 --> 31:46.793
then you know
everything's cool.

31:46.862 --> 31:49.448
- It's kind of ironic that Gus
and Candace

31:49.517 --> 31:53.344
are propped up
against a septic tank

31:53.413 --> 31:57.517
working our their

31:57.586 --> 31:58.827
Weird, huh?

31:58.896 --> 32:00.793
- I can only assume
that you might have said

32:00.862 --> 32:03.206
something to her,
and that offends me,

32:03.275 --> 32:05.655
because my friends
and my parents

32:05.724 --> 32:07.448
have no ill thoughts
towards you,

32:07.517 --> 32:09.551
'cause I don't speak bad
about you to them.

32:09.620 --> 32:10.827
- Yeah.
- If your sister was just

32:10.896 --> 32:12.724
that quick to turn up on me

32:12.793 --> 32:14.827
in a conversation,
that means that there have been

32:14.896 --> 32:16.586
some negative conversations
about me.

32:16.655 --> 32:18.517
My peoples are some of the most
loving people in the world,

32:18.586 --> 32:20.689
and I actually would never
in my life

32:20.758 --> 32:23.344
put no bad bud
in their ear about y'all.

32:23.413 --> 32:24.793
- No. For sure.
- I would never do that...

32:24.862 --> 32:26.068
- That's the thing.
- Because--

32:26.137 --> 32:27.413
- I don't want you to think
I put a bad bud,

32:27.482 --> 32:28.586
because that's not the case.
I'm talking--

32:28.655 --> 32:29.896
- But that's
what it seemed like...

32:29.965 --> 32:31.275
- I know where it can seem--
- To me, Gus.

32:31.344 --> 32:32.482
- No. I understand
where it seems like that way.

32:32.551 --> 32:33.310
- Yeah.
- But I want you to give me

32:33.379 --> 32:34.482
the benefit of the doubt.

32:34.551 --> 32:35.758
I 100% see where
it can look that way,

32:35.827 --> 32:37.931
but, like,
I got a lot of for me,

32:38.000 --> 32:39.655
but I'm not a liar. Like, I...
- Yeah.

32:39.724 --> 32:41.862
- Can look you in the eyes and
tell you that was not the case.

32:41.931 --> 32:44.448
- I mean, I see them smiling,
so fingers crossed.

32:44.517 --> 32:45.931
- You see how bad
at anger problems

32:46.000 --> 32:47.379
and how I snap off leash?
Honestly,

32:47.448 --> 32:48.965
that's a family thing.
I didn't get this...

32:49.034 --> 32:50.551
- Yeah.
- From nowhere,

32:50.620 --> 32:52.413
and that's something that,
as a whole, me and my siblings,

32:52.482 --> 32:53.689
we all gotta work on.

32:53.758 --> 32:54.931
And I'll have a talk
with her about that,

32:55.000 --> 32:56.310
because, like,
that wasn't cool either.

32:56.379 --> 32:58.448
- Gus says he gonna talk
to his sister, and I'm like,

32:58.517 --> 33:01.137
"All right. Cool."
We'll see what happens,

33:01.206 --> 33:03.034
but if his sister show up
with the bull

33:03.103 --> 33:05.206
she's gonna meet her match.
And you so you...

33:05.275 --> 33:06.689
- I'll take care of that.
- Inviting your sister here.

33:06.758 --> 33:08.103
I'm like, "Okay.

33:08.172 --> 33:10.103
Well, now, I gotta be
on extra defense mode."

33:10.172 --> 33:11.551
- Yeah.
- So I'm like, "Okay."

33:11.620 --> 33:12.862
- And I--trust me.
I understand, like, the frantic

33:12.931 --> 33:14.448
or the worry
that would come with that,

33:14.517 --> 33:15.689
but just know I'll handle that.

33:15.758 --> 33:17.034
I'll make sure
everything's good.

33:17.103 --> 33:18.551
Trust me. You ain't
gotta worry about that.

33:18.620 --> 33:20.482
- Oh, come on. Hug it out.

33:20.551 --> 33:22.620
- I know I said some
that might have triggered you.

33:22.689 --> 33:24.344
All I can do
is apologize for it.

33:24.413 --> 33:25.655
- And that's all I want.
- Oh, no, but--

33:25.724 --> 33:26.931
- But come on. Give me a hug.
Let's go for it.

33:27.000 --> 33:27.793
- Come on. Let's go.
- I love you. Thank you.

33:27.862 --> 33:29.000
Cheers.
- See?

33:29.068 --> 33:30.034
- It means a lot you came
and talked to me.

33:30.103 --> 33:31.068
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

33:31.137 --> 33:32.931
That's exactly what we needed.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.206
- Talk to your mother
sister, because--

33:34.275 --> 33:35.517
- No I will.
I'll take care of it.

33:35.586 --> 33:37.586
I promise. I ain't gonna
let no happen.

33:37.655 --> 33:39.034
You know, the fact
that Candace actually is coming

33:39.103 --> 33:41.000
and apologizing,
that's all I needed to hear.

33:41.068 --> 33:42.827
That's all I needed to do
to get out of my funk.

33:42.896 --> 33:44.448
I'ma grab a water.
I'll be right back.

33:44.517 --> 33:46.655
I can forgive and, like, forget
pretty quickly, if you, like,

33:46.724 --> 33:48.413
come and actually, like,
give me a genuine apology,

33:48.482 --> 33:50.103
and I feel like Candace
is doing that right now.

33:50.172 --> 33:52.103
- Did y'all make up?
- Yeah we're good.

33:52.172 --> 33:53.689
I think we'll be all right now.

33:53.758 --> 33:56.482
- Good. I'm happy.
- Me too.

33:56.551 --> 33:57.931
Give me a hug,
just 'cause I love you.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.827
- I feel like Gus has matured
a lot since Montana,

34:00.896 --> 34:03.862
and as long as he's putting
his best foot forward

34:03.931 --> 34:06.068
and just trying to be better
every day,

34:06.137 --> 34:09.034
then I'm proud of him,
and I'm gonna support him.

34:09.103 --> 34:11.206
- Are y'all kumbaya, my Lord?

34:11.275 --> 34:12.448
- I'm honestly shocked
how quickly

34:12.517 --> 34:14.137
this conversation happened.

34:14.206 --> 34:16.413
<i>You know, Gus and Candace
are both very stubborn people.</i>

34:16.482 --> 34:18.275
I don't know what happened,
but the fact that they took it

34:18.344 --> 34:22.000
upon themselves this quick
to talk about it? Growth.

34:22.068 --> 34:24.931
- Did y'all fix it?
- We fixed it.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.137
- Aw!

34:26.206 --> 34:29.206
- That's what I like to hear!
Whoo!

34:29.275 --> 34:32.413
- We fixed it.
- That's what I like to hear.

34:38.896 --> 34:40.206
- Yeah, no. I'm surprised, man.

34:40.275 --> 34:41.551
- What, that Candace came
to talk to me?

34:41.620 --> 34:42.896
- 'Cause y'all are both
prideful as

34:42.965 --> 34:44.482
That's when I go to the grill,
make some steaks,

34:44.551 --> 34:46.068
<i>and he was like,
"Everything's good now.</i>

34:46.137 --> 34:48.172
You know, everything's Gucci."
I'm like, "Good. Finally."

34:48.241 --> 34:49.724
- We pretty much explained,
like, yo,

34:49.793 --> 34:52.275
we're both bullheaded as hell.
Like, we gotta both--like,

34:52.344 --> 34:54.517
when you feel a certain way
come talk to me.

34:54.586 --> 34:55.862
- What did I say? I said--
- Like, tell me straight up.

34:55.931 --> 34:57.551
Don't let linger.
- I said to Candace.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.068
I was like,
"You know what's funny?

34:59.137 --> 35:00.310
Y'all are more similar
than you will ever understand."

35:00.379 --> 35:01.586
- I mean it kinda it's true.

35:01.655 --> 35:02.827
Once we got our minds
set on something,

35:02.896 --> 35:04.379
you can't really
tell us

35:04.448 --> 35:06.758
<i>Me and Candace
are both extremely bullheaded,</i>

35:06.827 --> 35:08.758
and I think that's a big reason
why we butt heads

35:08.827 --> 35:10.103
as hard as we do.
And I even told her.

35:10.172 --> 35:11.517
I was like,
"It's one thing to come at me.

35:11.586 --> 35:13.034
"could have handled that.
It's just, like,

35:13.103 --> 35:14.586
"when you start bringing family
stuff into it

35:14.655 --> 35:16.275
that puts me
in a really rough situation."

35:16.344 --> 35:18.655
- Because, like, I get your
sister racking off emotions,

35:18.724 --> 35:20.862
but, like, we were all
looking for you, at the time.

35:20.931 --> 35:21.965
- Yeah, for sure.
- I don't think she knew that.

35:22.034 --> 35:23.517
- No. She didn't...
- So like...

35:23.586 --> 35:24.896
- Know that. All she knew--
- She's racking off of like,

35:24.965 --> 35:26.172
"that."
- All she knew was I ran away.

35:26.241 --> 35:28.034
I could be in danger.
Why did he run away?

35:28.103 --> 35:29.482
Oh, him and Candace
got into an argument.

35:29.551 --> 35:30.931
All right. I'm gonna
Candace up then,

35:31.000 --> 35:32.344
'cause he's in danger,
'cause you pushed him

35:32.413 --> 35:34.344
to do this.
Like, I get the way she thinks,

35:34.413 --> 35:35.655
'cause I think the same way,

35:35.724 --> 35:37.482
and we're both just reactive
and impulsive.

35:37.551 --> 35:39.310
And those protective instincts
just come out.

35:39.379 --> 35:40.448
- Have you told her yet,
or you waiting?

35:40.517 --> 35:41.586
- Well,
I haven't called her yet,

35:41.655 --> 35:43.068
but I will. Like, it's--
- Yeah.

35:43.137 --> 35:44.275
- And it'll be one
conversation. It's not like...

35:44.344 --> 35:45.724
- Simple.
- I gotta be like, "Don't do"--

35:45.793 --> 35:47.034
like, it'll be like--

35:47.103 --> 35:48.586
- Yeah. Literally be like,
"We squashed it."

35:48.655 --> 35:49.724
- Yeah, and she'll be like...
- Everything--it's all good.

35:49.793 --> 35:50.655
- "All right, bet.
Then we're good."

35:50.724 --> 35:51.965
- Yeah that's cool.

35:52.034 --> 35:53.275
- We're the same way
with that kind of stuff,

35:53.344 --> 35:54.482
so it'll be straight.
- What y'all cooking?

35:54.551 --> 35:58.137
- Some steak.
- Give me your salmon.

35:58.206 --> 36:00.827
- Oh, bitch, where you going?
- We going on a boat.

36:00.896 --> 36:02.482
<i>I wanted to go kayaking
with Jeremiah,</i>

36:02.551 --> 36:05.241
'cause I think that we both
are outdoorsy people naturally,

36:05.310 --> 36:07.379
<i>and we like doing a little bit
more active things</i>

36:07.448 --> 36:08.586
than the rest of the roommates.

36:08.655 --> 36:10.344
- All right.
You got your drink?

36:10.413 --> 36:11.793
- Yep.

36:11.862 --> 36:13.068
- Me and Bethany are gonna
go out on the kayaks,

36:13.137 --> 36:14.344
but first, I gotta make sure
that she knows

36:14.413 --> 36:15.896
a little bit what she's doing,

36:15.965 --> 36:18.206
<i>because when I took Candace
out on Lake Havasu,</i>

36:18.275 --> 36:20.241
that girl
was struggling kayaking.

36:20.310 --> 36:21.551
- Oh, I got it. I got it.
- There you go.

36:21.620 --> 36:23.172
- I got it.
- Great job, Candace.

36:23.241 --> 36:24.758
- I don't know how to get back.

36:24.827 --> 36:26.206
<i>- She was just going
in circles,</i>

36:26.275 --> 36:28.896
so, Bethany,
do you know how to kayak

36:28.965 --> 36:30.241
before I get you out
on the water?

36:30.310 --> 36:32.034
- On the right side,
you're gonna go left.

36:32.103 --> 36:33.275
And you're gonna do the left
side you're gonna go right.

36:33.344 --> 36:35.310
- Yes, perfect.
- You know how to swim?

36:35.379 --> 36:38.137
- I am an expert swimmer.
I've had a pool my whole life.

36:38.206 --> 36:40.103
- Okay, 'cause, baby,
you know I can't save you.

36:40.172 --> 36:42.344
- Because of my titties,
I float.

36:44.034 --> 36:47.862
- Bethany is about to hop on
the canoe thingy with Jeremiah,

36:47.931 --> 36:49.310
and I'm like, "Okay."

36:49.379 --> 36:50.655
- I'll be right out.

36:50.724 --> 36:52.931
<i>- This is looking really
ebony and ivory.</i>

36:53.000 --> 36:56.068
I'm like, "Okay."
All right. I'm for it.

36:58.448 --> 37:00.448
- Yeah.
You're holding it backwards.

37:00.517 --> 37:03.068
There you go.

37:03.137 --> 37:05.413
- So cute, you guys.

37:05.482 --> 37:08.379
Jeremiah and Bethany
are looking like they were

37:08.448 --> 37:10.206
in part of "The Notebook."

37:13.620 --> 37:17.551
- I have to be outdoors and do,
like, the outdoorsy

37:17.620 --> 37:19.137
