02:12.715 --> 02:17.245
It's true, the Hittite army
has 16,000 troops camped outside Kadesh.

02:17.345 --> 02:19.414
What's less clear is why.

02:19.514 --> 02:22.817
The Hittites are trying
to cross the border.

02:22.917 --> 02:24.097
Obviously.

02:24.644 --> 02:25.970
What else would they be doing?

02:26.070 --> 02:30.508
Anticipating an invasion by us,
according to our information.

02:30.608 --> 02:34.787
They think we are preparing an attack,
which we are not.

02:34.887 --> 02:38.433
What I don't want to do,
and won't do, is sit here,

02:38.533 --> 02:43.396
and wait until we're fighting
Hittite armies outside the palace walls.

02:43.496 --> 02:44.956
Come.

02:54.173 --> 02:58.244
- What do the entrails say?
- They don't "say" anything.

02:58.344 --> 03:01.627
They imply.
And that's open to interpretation.

03:01.727 --> 03:05.334
So, interpret them. We'll win
or we won't in a preemptive attack?

03:05.434 --> 03:07.894
It's a yes or a no.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.904
And it's not clear.

03:18.072 --> 03:20.350
But something else is.

03:21.117 --> 03:24.245
In the battle, a leader will be saved,

03:24.345 --> 03:27.745
and his savior will someday lead.

03:30.376 --> 03:34.530
Then the entrails should also say
that we will abandon reason,

03:34.630 --> 03:37.380
and be guided by omens.

03:46.017 --> 03:49.568
Great Sekhmet,
Pharaoh drinks in your name,

03:49.668 --> 03:54.025
and prays for victory
over the Hittites at Kadesh.

03:55.568 --> 03:59.931
Your first order of business
when the time comes, you retire her.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.432
I will.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.851
I don't know why my father hasn't.

04:03.951 --> 04:09.267
But, just in case If you see me
in any real danger out there,

04:09.367 --> 04:10.825
ride the other way.

04:11.601 --> 04:13.771
I'm serious.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.274
When I look at you,
I still see the two boys

04:18.374 --> 04:21.344
who grew up together, close as brothers.

04:21.677 --> 04:24.599
If, for any reason
you ever forget that...

04:25.932 --> 04:27.682
let these remind you.

04:29.018 --> 04:33.517
Long enough to be effective from horseback,
not so long that you trip over them.

04:34.357 --> 04:38.428
- This is his. You've got mine.
- That's right. That's how I want it.

04:38.528 --> 04:41.764
You have each other's,
to keep each other safe.

04:41.864 --> 04:45.533
Promise me you'll do that... always.

05:44.285 --> 05:46.621
SETI! SETI! SETI!

05:46.721 --> 05:48.761
SETI!

06:14.165 --> 06:15.005
There!

06:28.888 --> 06:34.210
Deploy Amun division to the north,
Ra division to the center,

06:34.310 --> 06:37.950
and Ptah to the South.
And we hold Seth in reserve.

06:38.397 --> 06:40.687
- In reserve?
- Yes.

06:42.376 --> 06:45.396
We should concentrate
our strength in the center.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.700
You should concentrate yours
on fighting.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.001
Leave the generalship to me.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.112
Fire!

08:15.912 --> 08:16.752
Fire!

08:47.068 --> 08:48.638
Charge!

11:16.592 --> 11:19.092
Take ramses! Go!

11:20.163 --> 11:21.853
Go!

11:30.273 --> 11:34.113
Turn around! Turn around!

11:51.335 --> 11:55.125
Moses! Moses! Moses!

12:08.369 --> 12:10.249
Moses.

12:11.247 --> 12:14.383
- What happened out there?
- Nothing.

12:14.483 --> 12:18.283
I asked the commanders
the same thing. They, too, lied.

12:19.088 --> 12:21.345
And I'm tired of it.

12:21.532 --> 12:24.766
He thinks something happened.
But it didn't.

12:24.866 --> 12:28.006
- Meaning?
- The high priestess, her prophecy.

12:28.106 --> 12:30.274
She said she couldn't see who would win.

12:30.374 --> 12:33.778
The other one.
"The leader will be saved, and..."

12:34.178 --> 12:35.798
so on.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.009
You saved my son's life?

12:41.511 --> 12:42.341
Yes.

12:43.904 --> 12:44.854
Sit.

12:46.616 --> 12:49.746
"Thank you" is not sufficient, but...

12:50.311 --> 12:51.691
thank you.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.925
I know you don't believe
in omens or prophecies...

12:56.025 --> 13:00.399
- but I do believe.
- And I respect that.

13:00.963 --> 13:05.143
But this isn't anything.
This doesn't even make any sense.

13:05.343 --> 13:06.873
Because you're not my blood.

13:08.137 --> 13:09.827
Yes.

13:10.039 --> 13:13.776
It's true, you can't succeed me.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.570
Not in the usual way.

13:15.670 --> 13:19.385
- Not in any way.
- In any way imaginable, sitting here.

13:20.716 --> 13:25.695
It's horrible to say this
about one's own son, but I...

13:26.931 --> 13:29.221
trust you more than him to lead.

13:32.928 --> 13:37.442
"The Hittite chariotry crashed through
our defense and began its attack.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.104
"I found myself
surrounded by the enemy.

13:40.204 --> 13:43.373
"No soldier, no shield-bearer

13:43.473 --> 13:46.583
"facing a desperate fight for my life.

13:47.076 --> 13:51.714
"Only with the help of the gods
did I defeat our attackers,

13:51.814 --> 13:55.748
- "and rejoin Ra division."
- Stop there.

13:57.044 --> 14:00.961
- Anything you'd like to rephrase?
- No.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.994
- Shall I go on?
- No, I'm sure the rest is fine.

14:05.194 --> 14:07.663
- What's next?
- Pithom.

14:07.763 --> 14:11.641
- What about it?
- The situation. The slaves.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.603
Fine. Ramses.

14:14.604 --> 14:15.463
What?

14:15.563 --> 14:18.443
Go up there, meet with the viceroy,
look around, make a report.

14:20.151 --> 14:20.968
Me?

14:21.068 --> 14:25.108
It will be yours someday.
Take an interest in it.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.378
What else?

14:37.668 --> 14:40.895
- I'll go to see the viceroy.
- No.

14:42.106 --> 14:43.602
I'll go.

14:43.799 --> 14:47.469
- It's beneath you.
- It's beneath any general.

14:48.070 --> 14:49.957
I'll do it.

14:50.548 --> 14:55.002
Ramses, can we forget what happened
on the battlefield?

14:55.102 --> 14:58.890
If our positions had been reversed,
I would've saved your life, too.

14:58.990 --> 15:01.110
I know. I know.

15:13.663 --> 15:18.675
It was a good shot.
Even if the gods did guide your aim.

15:23.573 --> 15:26.183
A little venom in your blood
is a good thing.

15:27.318 --> 15:31.038
Makes you less vulnerable
to the next poisonous bite.

15:31.238 --> 15:33.851
Maybe even my father's.

16:14.557 --> 16:17.043
Welcome to Pithom.

16:18.186 --> 16:20.396
You get used to the smell.

16:35.703 --> 16:39.524
The viceroy seems to be enjoying
a good share of his resources.

16:39.624 --> 16:43.277
This isn't a job everyone
wants to do, my Lord.

16:43.377 --> 16:48.547
A certain degree of comfort
is necessary to keep up his spirits.

16:51.235 --> 16:55.724
You know what the problem is?
People live too long these days.

16:55.824 --> 17:00.878
Every year, the death rate lags further
behind the birth rate. And these people...

17:01.178 --> 17:04.799
they reproduce like it's a sport.

17:04.898 --> 17:07.300
This is the problem?
A growing work force?

17:07.401 --> 17:10.070
No, of course not.
It's good for production.

17:10.171 --> 17:12.570
Of course it is, but only to a point.

17:13.616 --> 17:17.118
When that population wants you dead...
yes, it's a problem.

17:17.219 --> 17:22.733
So, either I'm given more troops
to maintain order...

17:22.834 --> 17:24.402
or I start thinning out the herd.

17:24.502 --> 17:30.433
You start slaughtering people for no reason
other than this precarious theory...

17:30.533 --> 17:33.578
You will provoke the very thing
you say you wish to avoid.

17:33.678 --> 17:37.168
Fine, then give me the troops.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.918
- Let's go down and talk to them.
- Why on earth?

17:41.018 --> 17:45.823
You're worried about sedition.
Let's find out if that worry is real.

17:45.923 --> 17:49.352
- By talking to them?
- By looking at them...

17:49.452 --> 17:51.512
when I talk with them.

17:51.612 --> 17:55.993
You can tell a lot about somebody...
looking him in the eye.

17:56.450 --> 18:01.331
Let me tell you something about Hebrews.

18:01.789 --> 18:05.625
They are a conniving, combative people.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.854
Do you know what "Israelite" means
in their own language?

18:08.954 --> 18:13.576
- "He who fights with God."
- "He who wrestles with God."

18:13.676 --> 18:15.662
There is a difference.

18:15.762 --> 18:19.522
Look, I may not be as educated as you,
which, apparently, you want to remind me of.

18:19.932 --> 18:24.070
But I have to deal with them every day.
I know what I'm talking about.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.650
You don't have to come.
I'll go down there myself.

19:05.586 --> 19:06.976
Stop!

19:07.580 --> 19:12.230
- Why is he being punished?
- Persistent troublemaker, My Lord.

19:13.269 --> 19:15.299
Why is he smiling?

19:15.504 --> 19:17.244
He says he feels no pain, My Lord.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.815
Then why whip him?

19:31.921 --> 19:36.841
You were not gathered up at random.
I asked to see

19:37.293 --> 19:39.103
the elders.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.057
Come on. What do you pray for?

19:43.683 --> 19:47.754
- We pray to see Canaan again.
- Canaan again? You've never seen it.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.450
I've seen Canaan.
I've seen that it's inhabited

19:50.550 --> 19:54.177
by tribes fiercer than Egypt's military.
So, you won't be returning to it

19:54.277 --> 19:56.890
- or, if you do, from it.
- God says otherwise.

19:56.990 --> 20:00.783
Which God? Your God? The God of Abraham?
The God that says that you are special?

20:00.883 --> 20:04.447
That you are chosen? Let me tell...
Come here. Up. Come here.

20:10.851 --> 20:12.334
He's wrong.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.512
I can see you're unconvinced,
and that's a problem.

20:17.066 --> 20:21.110
Because next to unrealistic belief lies
fanaticism. And next to that, sedition,

20:21.210 --> 20:23.915
and next to that, revolution.
And it all starts with the elders.

20:24.015 --> 20:26.097
- What's your name?
- What's yours?

20:29.762 --> 20:34.148
I'll tell you. I am Moses, son of Bithia,
grandson of Horemheb.

20:39.271 --> 20:43.369
Record this one's name and the rest
of them. Bring in the next group.

20:45.861 --> 20:47.541
My name is Nun.

20:52.043 --> 20:53.144
My Lord!

20:53.244 --> 20:55.675
- Stop there!
- Let him through.

20:56.222 --> 20:59.450
There's something the elder
has to tell you. But not here.

20:59.550 --> 21:03.329
- Say where and when.
- The prayer house, tonight.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.849
Here.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.284
I see you've survived your adventure.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.779
- Sorry to make you wait again.
- I'm not waiting.

21:20.071 --> 21:22.698
- How was your trip to the quarry?
- Fine.

21:22.798 --> 21:25.245
You saw what I'm up against.

21:26.202 --> 21:30.206
Tell me, is there any more of my records
I could get for you before you leave?

21:30.306 --> 21:36.571
You can tell me... Has all of this
been reported to Memphis?

21:36.671 --> 21:39.757
Was it approved?
Do you have it in writing?

21:39.857 --> 21:42.927
- Of course. It's on record.
- So you don't mind if we check?

21:45.071 --> 21:47.141
Of course I don't mind.

21:47.390 --> 21:50.493
But I don't understand what's gone wrong.
Have I done something to displease you?

21:50.593 --> 21:54.270
And if so, is there any way
I could please you?

21:55.356 --> 21:57.816
You can stop living like a king.

21:58.192 --> 22:00.072
You're not one.

22:54.390 --> 22:56.951
"...and you will occupy
the land of Canaan."

22:57.051 --> 23:00.613
- Canaan is already occupied.
- God promises we will return.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.907
In chains or in coffins?

23:03.207 --> 23:07.103
As free men into a land flowing
with milk and honey.

23:15.645 --> 23:18.914
Can they at least wait outside?
We're not dangerous.

23:19.014 --> 23:20.324
Wait by the horses.

23:25.071 --> 23:28.224
- Do you believe in coincidence?
- As much as anything else.

23:28.524 --> 23:31.455
- I don't think this is one.
- What isn't?

23:31.869 --> 23:35.498
You coming to Pithom. Why did you come?

23:35.598 --> 23:36.618
Business.

23:41.303 --> 23:42.892
Sit.

23:49.987 --> 23:51.711
Who's your father?

23:52.114 --> 23:56.085
I know you don't know his name. Only that
he was a general in Pharaoh's army...

23:56.185 --> 23:58.379
unnamed by your mother.

23:58.779 --> 24:00.729
I can see this is
making you uncomfortable.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.284
This will interest you.

24:05.194 --> 24:06.954
There was no general.

24:07.989 --> 24:11.684
Your mother... the woman you call
your mother, has no children.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.145
You were born a slave.

24:14.345 --> 24:17.923
- Don't go. Don't go.
- It's better for you that I do.

24:19.408 --> 24:20.981
I'm leaving.

24:21.081 --> 24:24.600
If you leave now, you'll just come back

24:24.700 --> 24:28.993
because you know something's wrong.
You've always felt it.

24:30.553 --> 24:32.059
Please.

24:33.222 --> 24:34.878
Everybody out.

24:34.978 --> 24:36.651
Out.

24:47.403 --> 24:49.138
The year of your birth,

24:49.238 --> 24:52.742
there was a prophecy
that our leader would be born

24:52.842 --> 24:55.245
to liberate us from our bondage.

24:55.345 --> 24:57.614
And so, there was an edict from Memphis

24:57.796 --> 25:02.685
to kill every firstborn Hebrew boy.

25:02.785 --> 25:04.755
Your parents didn't wait
for that to happen.

25:05.287 --> 25:09.617
Any chance of your survival
was better than no chance.

25:09.717 --> 25:12.286
They handed you to your sister.

25:12.386 --> 25:17.333
She took you in a basket
to the banks of the river,

25:17.433 --> 25:20.603
and she floated you to where she knew

25:20.703 --> 25:23.576
Pharaoh Paramesse's daughter,
Bithia, bathed.

25:23.676 --> 25:27.577
Bithia took you and your sister,
Miriam, as a maid,

25:27.677 --> 25:29.762
and raised you as her own.

25:29.862 --> 25:34.750
She probably even loved you,
but she never told you,

25:34.850 --> 25:36.619
or anyone else, the truth.

25:37.119 --> 25:39.439
You are Hebrew.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.319
The truth?

25:43.176 --> 25:46.416
The truth is,
it's not even that good a story.

25:47.897 --> 25:52.254
And I thought you people were
meant to be good storytellers.

26:04.313 --> 26:06.153
You, slave.

26:08.450 --> 26:10.005
You!

26:58.159 --> 27:01.079
Do you expect a reward
for this information?

27:01.662 --> 27:05.182
Our reward is being of service to you.

27:05.282 --> 27:07.068
That said, if there were

27:07.168 --> 27:10.418
some token you had in mind
beyond that...

27:10.755 --> 27:12.945
we wouldn't refuse it.

27:13.090 --> 27:17.258
How about this, then?
What about if I don't kill you?

27:18.054 --> 27:21.824
That would be sufficient payment.

27:22.391 --> 27:24.101
You people.

28:07.745 --> 28:10.445
Please, leave.

28:11.874 --> 28:13.476
Please.

28:19.523 --> 28:22.852
- How did it go?
- We can talk about that another time.

28:22.952 --> 28:24.395
We can talk about it now,

28:24.495 --> 28:28.620
if only as a respite from this army
of grim-faced physicians.

28:31.102 --> 28:32.662
Sit.

28:38.334 --> 28:42.080
We're taking a thorough look
at the city records,

28:42.180 --> 28:43.831
and the man is clearly a thief.

28:43.931 --> 28:47.643
It's one of life's
more depressing ironies...

28:47.743 --> 28:50.273
that the men who crave power
are best fitted to acquire it,

28:50.373 --> 28:52.818
and least fitted to exercise it.

28:58.321 --> 28:59.661
What's wrong, Moses?

29:00.531 --> 29:02.350
You're sick.

29:02.450 --> 29:06.501
Something else is troubling you.
I can tell.

29:07.555 --> 29:09.835
No, nothing else.

29:30.645 --> 29:32.865
May you be alert,

29:33.189 --> 29:36.539
rejuvenated and protected by the gods,

29:36.859 --> 29:38.689
Every moment of your eternal life.

30:31.606 --> 30:34.836
And to the left.

30:36.143 --> 30:39.197
No, your left. More, more, more.

30:39.297 --> 30:41.125
Good.

30:41.724 --> 30:43.734
It is tall.

30:43.834 --> 30:47.391
Monuments are monuments
for a reason. They inspire.

30:47.930 --> 30:51.107
Inspire what, in this case?

30:51.225 --> 30:54.395
In this, and in every case, power.

30:56.606 --> 30:58.766
Say it out loud, whatever it is.

30:59.375 --> 31:03.745
The viceroy of Pithom is outside.
He's not on the agenda.

31:03.988 --> 31:08.017
- He can go back to Pithom until he is.
- No, we should deal with this.

31:08.117 --> 31:09.487
Bring him in.

31:21.088 --> 31:26.077
If you came here to beg the new king's
forgiveness, it won't work. Arrest him.

31:26.177 --> 31:30.014
Wait, please. May I at least respond?

31:30.114 --> 31:33.776
I beg you. It's in your interest.

31:33.876 --> 31:36.016
- You make it short.
- I will...

31:36.979 --> 31:38.309
to the king alone.

31:38.940 --> 31:44.760
My advice is that he, and the other
generals, also leave the room.

31:45.046 --> 31:48.319
Really? That's your advice?

31:49.659 --> 31:51.619
You are not his advisor.

31:52.887 --> 31:56.232
- That's right. You are.
- That's right.

31:56.332 --> 31:57.882
Moses.

32:01.495 --> 32:02.999
Moses.

32:05.508 --> 32:09.547
Everybody but the viceroy... out.

32:27.897 --> 32:30.067
Terrible news.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.870
There you are.

32:35.329 --> 32:37.019
So...

32:37.865 --> 32:41.378
The viceroy. You didn't arrest him.

32:41.478 --> 32:44.338
You didn't take
your chief advisor's advice.

32:46.916 --> 32:48.876
No, he came.

32:50.720 --> 32:53.372
He told me of an incident
involving two guards.

32:53.472 --> 32:58.194
One of which survived the attack.
And I told him I did not care.

32:59.028 --> 33:02.018
And then, he told me
the most unbelievable story.

33:02.648 --> 33:05.126
Told to him, he said,
by very reliable sources.

33:05.226 --> 33:07.145
Then, when pressed...

33:07.570 --> 33:11.030
He admitted that they were Hebrew spies.

33:11.407 --> 33:14.539
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Yes.

33:15.745 --> 33:18.217
And what do you make of it?

33:18.347 --> 33:21.234
I think it's offensive,
and I think it's ridiculous.

33:21.334 --> 33:24.502
Yes. Yes! You, of all people, a Hebrew.

33:27.690 --> 33:31.986
And I said,
how can I believe such a story?

33:33.029 --> 33:34.792
Cousin...

33:35.598 --> 33:36.466
You can't.

33:36.566 --> 33:39.346
What if I take the chance
of not believing it, Moses?

33:41.704 --> 33:43.774
What am I to do?

33:45.233 --> 33:45.943
Bithia!

33:50.279 --> 33:51.806
Mother.

33:51.906 --> 33:55.877
The man is a thief.
My son discovers this. Not you.

33:56.177 --> 33:59.680
And he reports it to your father,
who would have hanged this thief,

33:59.780 --> 34:01.624
if he hadn't been dying himself.

34:01.824 --> 34:06.028
- You believe his feeble, self-serving lies.
- All I want to know is if it is true.

34:06.128 --> 34:08.369
I didn't ask for a tirade.

34:08.469 --> 34:12.556
To talk about this any longer
would dignify it, and I won't do that.

34:12.657 --> 34:16.938
- Answer the question. Yes or no?
- Was I talking to you?

34:17.339 --> 34:21.310
Bring her in. Bring her in. Now!

34:23.579 --> 34:27.067
Miriam! Come. Sit. Sit down.

34:29.518 --> 34:33.688
Now, I'm going to ask you some things
that are going to seem very strange to you.

34:33.789 --> 34:36.620
I just would like you
to answer them truthfully.

34:38.360 --> 34:40.440
How do you know Moses?

34:41.789 --> 34:44.306
You know how I know him.

34:44.784 --> 34:48.712
And you. I helped raise you both.

34:49.797 --> 34:51.627
So you are not his sister, then?

34:52.358 --> 34:54.626
Of course not.

34:55.252 --> 34:58.618
- And you're not a Hebrew.
- No.

35:01.517 --> 35:04.146
Place your arm on the table.

35:07.181 --> 35:09.516
- Ramses...
- Don't be stupid!

35:09.616 --> 35:11.649
- Ramases!
- I am not talking to you!

35:13.362 --> 35:15.812
I am talking to her.

35:18.776 --> 35:22.810
Your whole arm on the table, Miriam.
Thank you.

35:24.407 --> 35:26.317
Ramses...

35:27.318 --> 35:31.303
- don't take this any further.
- Don't take this any further, or what?

35:32.206 --> 35:35.910
- Do not take this any further.
- Are you quite sure about that?

35:36.210 --> 35:38.680
Get your hand off it, or use it, now.

35:40.798 --> 35:43.558
Or perhaps you'd like
to answer the question?

35:49.857 --> 35:51.397
Then I'll proceed.

35:52.443 --> 35:54.512
Miriam, I'm going to ask you again,

35:54.612 --> 35:57.950
and if your answer is again no,
I apologize for what happens next.

36:03.362 --> 36:05.412
Are you his sister?

36:07.808 --> 36:08.785
No.

36:18.803 --> 36:20.183
Yes!

36:21.372 --> 36:23.252
Yes!

36:56.065 --> 36:58.901
You don't need a reason
to kill him, but you have one.

36:59.001 --> 37:00.636
- This was treason.
- How was it treason?

37:00.736 --> 37:04.309
- He just admitted he knew.
- That wasn't an admission!

37:05.007 --> 37:06.977
Simply did not want her arm lopped off!

37:09.478 --> 37:13.783
I saw it in his eyes.
He does not believe this story.

37:14.183 --> 37:16.519
I don't want to believe it!

37:16.619 --> 37:19.264
You want to believe it, because it's an
opportunity to be rid of him

37:19.364 --> 37:20.832
which you always wanted.

37:20.932 --> 37:24.282
I didn't say "exiled," I said "dead."

37:27.363 --> 37:31.681
That, I'm sure,
will follow where he's going.

37:39.108 --> 37:42.300
Khyan, allow me to talk to my mother.

37:43.346 --> 37:45.586
Yes, sir, yes.

38:02.465 --> 38:04.115
Come, Miriam.

38:06.736 --> 38:11.566
It isn't every man who would protect a
servant who's nothing more to him than that.

38:11.666 --> 38:16.279
Certainly no one else in this family,
including me.

38:16.379 --> 38:20.049
I wouldn't have said
what he wanted to hear.

38:22.460 --> 38:25.030
And neither would she.

38:27.198 --> 38:29.388
That's how much we love you.

38:35.831 --> 38:37.261
"We"?

38:41.579 --> 38:44.532
- It's not true.
- It is true.

38:44.907 --> 38:47.527
You were wearing this
when I brought you to the river.

38:49.445 --> 38:52.115
I took it off you for obvious reasons.

38:52.582 --> 38:54.002
That's you.

38:55.518 --> 38:58.648
The connection between you
and our mother.

39:03.693 --> 39:06.363
Your sister saved your life.

39:06.846 --> 39:09.526
Now you saved hers...

39:10.132 --> 39:11.017
Moshe.

39:36.125 --> 39:37.755
Miriam.

39:54.577 --> 39:56.557
Sorry, sir.

40:02.501 --> 40:05.489
- Moses!
- Moses!

42:50.361 --> 42:54.215
I have nothing to steal.
My horse is dead.

42:54.315 --> 42:56.705
We're not here for your horse, Moshe.

45:02.351 --> 45:03.621
A little bit higher.

45:22.071 --> 45:24.791
What are you doing?
Don't stop. Keep working.

45:24.891 --> 45:27.917
You, get water for our goats.

45:38.963 --> 45:42.204
You. Wait your turn.

45:51.892 --> 45:55.092
Move your animals away from the troughs.

46:08.559 --> 46:10.099
It's yours again.

46:33.334 --> 46:35.044
Where are you from?

46:35.711 --> 46:37.551
West of here.

46:38.831 --> 46:41.927
- Where are you going?
- East.

46:42.693 --> 46:44.303
What did you do?

46:44.971 --> 46:46.221
What do you mean?

46:49.308 --> 46:50.960
You committed some crime?

46:51.060 --> 46:55.865
With respect, your daughters
invited me for some food.

46:55.965 --> 46:58.969
They did not tell me
there would be an interrogation.

46:59.669 --> 47:02.573
I'm sorry. I'm just curious.

47:06.409 --> 47:09.979
You are welcome to get cleaned up
before dinner, if that appeals to you.

47:10.079 --> 47:14.634
And stay the night if you want,
before continuing on...

47:14.834 --> 47:16.536
to wherever it is.

47:17.036 --> 47:18.486
Thank you.

47:43.029 --> 47:46.447
Describe Memphis to someone
who's never been there and never will.

47:48.117 --> 47:49.644
It's...

47:49.744 --> 47:54.716
I don't want to say "civilized", because
I don't want to offend, but it is civilized.

47:54.816 --> 47:58.786
There's more there than sheep and goats.

48:00.246 --> 48:03.134
- There's more here than that.
- Really? Where?

48:05.801 --> 48:09.355
I'm sorry, that was rude. That was rude.

48:09.555 --> 48:11.874
I'm not ignorant
just because I live here.

48:12.174 --> 48:14.177
I can see that.

48:18.915 --> 48:20.633
I can tell you one thing.

48:20.733 --> 48:24.387
This is by far the nicest place

48:24.487 --> 48:26.907
between here and there.

48:28.241 --> 48:31.447
- And so you're leaving?
- Of course.

48:32.119 --> 48:34.033
There's nothing here
for someone like me.

48:38.726 --> 48:42.061
When? Today?

49:34.006 --> 49:36.964
Remember this moment in time...

49:37.293 --> 49:41.612
For after these vows,
you shall say to the world...

49:43.332 --> 49:46.652
"This is my husband." "This is my wife."

49:52.358 --> 49:54.602
- I, Zipporah...
- I, Moses...

49:54.702 --> 49:56.202
- Accept you, Zipporah...
- Accept you, Moses...

49:56.913 --> 49:59.293
to be no other than yourself.

50:00.141 --> 50:02.276
Loving what I know of you.

50:02.676 --> 50:05.336
Trusting what I do not yet know.

50:06.881 --> 50:10.618
With respect for your integrity.

50:10.718 --> 50:15.011
And faith in your abiding love for me.

50:16.148 --> 50:18.601
In all that life may bring us,

50:18.701 --> 50:21.254
- I pledge my love.
- I pledge my love.

50:21.354 --> 50:23.794
Who makes you happy?

50:24.774 --> 50:26.284
You do.

50:31.748 --> 50:34.368
What's the most important thing
in your life?

50:35.651 --> 50:37.271
You are.

50:39.739 --> 50:42.749
- Where would you rather be?
- Nowhere.

50:44.936 --> 50:46.456
And when will you leave me?

50:47.630 --> 50:48.960
Never.

50:50.508 --> 50:52.468
Proceed.

51:49.483 --> 51:51.713
I said "per se."

51:52.069 --> 51:55.907
I don't want to discuss my tomb, per se.

51:56.007 --> 52:00.061
I want to discuss why you seem
to want to discuss it all the time.

52:00.161 --> 52:04.363
Respectfully, it should have been your first
construction order on taking the throne.

52:04.463 --> 52:06.692
It'll be a big project,
as you might imagine.

52:06.792 --> 52:09.357
So is my house, apparently.

52:10.146 --> 52:13.449
- Is there a problem with the palace?
- It's not done.

52:13.549 --> 52:15.126
It won't be long now.

52:15.226 --> 52:20.097
You said that months ago. Meanwhile
I'm living there like... a Bedouin.

52:21.757 --> 52:25.311
Get it done. Faster!

52:25.928 --> 52:27.690
Or do I have to kill somebody?

52:28.798 --> 52:30.648
I think you made your point.

52:41.369 --> 52:43.312
Good throw, father.

52:43.512 --> 52:45.082
Just aim a little higher.

52:49.442 --> 52:51.051
Almost.

52:58.903 --> 53:01.330
Have you ever been to the top?

53:03.240 --> 53:04.020
No.

53:05.393 --> 53:07.095
Would you like to?

53:07.495 --> 53:10.115
- Mother says it's forbidden.
- By who?

53:10.940 --> 53:12.546
Our God.

53:13.651 --> 53:15.511
Our God...

53:15.611 --> 53:18.331
stops us from climbing mountains?

53:18.531 --> 53:22.438
Not every Mountain. Just that one.

53:23.853 --> 53:26.033
It's God's Mountain.

53:42.180 --> 53:44.210
You're confusing him.

53:47.493 --> 53:48.813
I'm not trying to.

53:49.312 --> 53:52.532
Is it good for our boy to grow up
believing in nothing?

53:52.632 --> 53:56.742
Is it bad to grow up
believing in yourself?

53:58.187 --> 54:00.198
- It's my faith.
- I know.

54:00.298 --> 54:02.091
- And it's his, too.
- I understand.

54:02.191 --> 54:03.993
He can make up his mind when he's older.

54:04.093 --> 54:05.543
- Yes.
- Just like you.

54:06.370 --> 54:09.370
He's a lot like me already.

55:32.306 --> 55:33.746
Moshe.

55:53.603 --> 55:55.103
Help me!

55:56.038 --> 55:58.068
I think my leg is broken.

55:59.567 --> 56:01.597
More than that.

56:04.614 --> 56:06.444
What did you say?

56:09.285 --> 56:10.455
Who are you?

56:15.917 --> 56:16.930
Who are you?

56:18.920 --> 56:19.960
I'm a Shepherd.

56:21.022 --> 56:23.092
I thought you were a general.

56:28.179 --> 56:29.599
I need a general.

56:34.343 --> 56:35.378
Why?

56:35.778 --> 56:39.374
To fight. Why else?

56:40.650 --> 56:42.620
Fight who?

56:43.694 --> 56:45.034
For what?

56:47.031 --> 56:49.491
I think you know.

56:55.931 --> 56:59.341
I think you should go and see
what's happening to your people now.

57:00.127 --> 57:02.127
He won't be at peace until you do.

57:03.522 --> 57:06.342
Or are they not people...

57:06.442 --> 57:07.632
in your opinion?

57:11.714 --> 57:13.224
Who are you?

57:18.521 --> 57:20.361
I am.

57:31.284 --> 57:32.934
I am.

57:45.606 --> 57:48.136
You were hit on the head.

57:49.251 --> 57:52.895
Anything you saw
or think you saw afterwards,

57:53.306 --> 57:55.958
- was an effect of that.
- The storm...

57:56.058 --> 57:59.420
The storm started before
I was hit on the head.

57:59.520 --> 58:02.114
- It was not a storm.
- Fine, fine, fine.

58:02.214 --> 58:05.735
- The storm was something.
- It was something. It was something else.

58:05.835 --> 58:08.471
- But the boy was all in your head.
- How do you know?

58:08.871 --> 58:11.693
- How do you know?
- Because God isn't a boy!

58:11.793 --> 58:16.045
Then what does he look like? Describe him.
Describe him to someone like me.

58:16.145 --> 58:17.405
Do you know what you sound like?

58:18.114 --> 58:22.276
Yes. I sound... I sound delusional.

58:22.376 --> 58:25.279
Yes. Yes.

58:25.479 --> 58:28.629
- You just need more rest.
- Yes, yes.

58:30.960 --> 58:32.930
I have to tell you something.

58:33.571 --> 58:35.721
I have to tell you something.

58:38.017 --> 58:41.057
I've not been completely honest
with you.

58:41.395 --> 58:43.265
About what?

58:43.564 --> 58:45.762
About who I am.

58:46.275 --> 58:50.555
About what I've done and who I was.

58:50.655 --> 58:52.365
And how I feel.

58:54.200 --> 58:59.504
- About what you feel about me?
- No. No, I've been honest about that.

59:02.934 --> 59:04.794
Rest.

59:05.753 --> 59:07.530
- Rest.
- Don't leave me.

59:07.630 --> 59:09.810
No. No.

59:26.974 --> 59:28.954
Moshe.

59:44.850 --> 59:46.040
Gershom?

59:52.792 --> 59:57.104
- What are you doing out here?
- Nothing. I can't sleep.

59:59.757 --> 01:00:01.177
Are you worried about me?

01:00:02.927 --> 01:00:04.532
Yes.

01:00:05.262 --> 01:00:06.862
Don't.

01:00:08.124 --> 01:00:09.844
I'll be fine.

01:00:14.555 --> 01:00:16.825
- What's that?
- What's it look like?

01:00:23.239 --> 01:00:26.003
Come inside. Come inside!

01:00:51.642 --> 01:00:54.171
What are you going to do with all that?

01:00:56.756 --> 01:00:59.366
Make sure I see you again.

01:01:00.151 --> 01:01:03.311
Put it down and you can see me forever.

01:01:20.905 --> 01:01:22.067
What's this mean?

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:29.730
It's someone I used to know.

01:01:37.922 --> 01:01:40.582
This is not forever.

01:01:41.425 --> 01:01:44.135
I will see you again.

01:01:44.971 --> 01:01:47.091
Do you believe me?

01:01:51.961 --> 01:01:53.131
Good for you.

01:01:53.871 --> 01:01:57.171
Don't ever just say
what people want to hear.

01:01:59.277 --> 01:02:03.125
But I will... I will see you again.

01:02:09.937 --> 01:02:12.307
Will you keep this for me?

01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:15.231
Gershom.

01:02:16.294 --> 01:02:19.004
Gershom, please look at me.

01:02:34.203 --> 01:02:37.628
What kind of God tells a man
to leave his family?

01:02:38.341 --> 01:02:41.761
If you understand it,
I'll understand it.

01:02:42.837 --> 01:02:44.587
I don't.

01:02:45.114 --> 01:02:46.724
So I can't answer that question.

01:02:48.184 --> 01:02:53.295
If that's what faith means,
I will trade mine to keep you.

01:03:00.655 --> 01:03:02.705
Don't touch me.

01:03:04.383 --> 01:03:05.493
Go.

01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:07.950
Go!

01:04:13.928 --> 01:04:16.518
Father, have you some milk to spare?

01:04:16.998 --> 01:04:18.608
Yes.

01:04:18.949 --> 01:04:20.109
Where did you come from?

01:04:22.195 --> 01:04:23.865
I come from the sea.

01:04:24.572 --> 01:04:27.662
It's a narrow and dangerous path.

01:04:34.865 --> 01:04:36.666
Thank you, father.

01:05:47.171 --> 01:05:50.621
Joshua. I remember you.

01:05:51.525 --> 01:05:53.655
Do you still feel no pain?

01:06:00.042 --> 01:06:02.191
Keep your eye on the horse.

01:06:15.892 --> 01:06:17.942
- Thank you.
- Welcome back, brother.

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.673
Aaron...

01:06:22.773 --> 01:06:24.734
your brother.

01:06:24.834 --> 01:06:26.794
Ithamar.

01:06:29.171 --> 01:06:33.620
Ithamar, this...
is your famous Uncle Moses.

01:06:34.093 --> 01:06:35.983
He was once a prince of Egypt.

01:07:08.669 --> 01:07:09.779
I'm fine.

01:07:11.906 --> 01:07:14.436
Everybody's fine.

01:07:53.089 --> 01:07:54.949
You sleep so well, my boy

01:07:56.325 --> 01:07:59.983
because you know you are loved.

01:08:01.998 --> 01:08:04.528
I've never slept so well.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:28.648
I'm told I should
address you as Ramses...

01:08:28.747 --> 01:08:31.810
The Great, now.

01:08:33.321 --> 01:08:34.361
Moses...

01:08:35.163 --> 01:08:38.376
You're alive. I'm glad you're alive.

01:08:38.475 --> 01:08:42.042
Really? Is that why you only sent
two assassins to kill me?

01:08:43.197 --> 01:08:45.022
- My mother.
- Don't blame her.

01:08:45.122 --> 01:08:50.051
She wanted you dead. Who do you think
hid your sword where you would find it?

01:08:52.148 --> 01:08:53.917
Moses.

01:08:57.877 --> 01:08:59.956
I'm not here...

01:09:00.055 --> 01:09:02.283
to take your throne.

01:09:02.383 --> 01:09:06.923
It's not about the prophecy that worries
you so much. This is something else.

01:09:07.763 --> 01:09:10.228
I have been told...

01:09:10.328 --> 01:09:14.363
that things here have become...

01:09:14.812 --> 01:09:16.156
much worse.

01:09:16.256 --> 01:09:20.340
Things are better than
they ever have been, Moses.

01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:21.430
No.

01:09:21.631 --> 01:09:23.910
- We have order.
- Order? Order?

01:09:25.113 --> 01:09:26.948
The slaves...

01:09:27.049 --> 01:09:30.411
their bodies burn night and day now.

01:09:30.511 --> 01:09:34.256
I've seen it with my own eyes.
You call that order?

01:09:34.357 --> 01:09:36.484
- They're slaves. What would you expect?
- No, they're not.

01:09:36.584 --> 01:09:38.377
They're Egyptians,
they should be treated as Egyptians.

01:09:38.478 --> 01:09:41.848
They should have the same rights.
They should be paid for their work or...

01:09:41.948 --> 01:09:44.551
you must set them free.

01:09:44.892 --> 01:09:46.352
They are not Egyptians.

01:09:46.769 --> 01:09:49.464
They are slaves, Moses.
What else do you expect?

01:09:49.564 --> 01:09:51.328
They wouldn't know what to do

01:09:51.429 --> 01:09:54.343
if all of a sudden they were left
to fend for themselves like animals.

01:09:54.643 --> 01:09:56.783
Do not call them animals!

01:09:59.282 --> 01:10:03.853
Listen, from an economic standpoint
alone what you're asking,

01:10:03.953 --> 01:10:06.813
is problematic to say the least.

01:10:07.206 --> 01:10:11.861
I didn't expect to hear a simple yes.

01:10:12.061 --> 01:10:15.656
But I do not want to hear a simple no.

01:10:15.756 --> 01:10:17.633
Is that what you are telling me?
Are you saying no?

01:10:17.733 --> 01:10:21.136
I'm not saying no. I'm saying time.

01:10:22.096 --> 01:10:23.539
Time.

01:10:23.739 --> 01:10:26.638
- You're listening to Hebrews.
- I'm not listening to Hebrews.

01:10:27.076 --> 01:10:29.436
Who are you talking to?

01:10:30.938 --> 01:10:31.978
God.

01:10:36.252 --> 01:10:38.322
God.

01:10:38.654 --> 01:10:40.914
Which God?

01:11:02.053 --> 01:11:04.705
You're not seriously
considering his proposal.

01:11:04.805 --> 01:11:06.616
Is it a proposal?

01:11:06.716 --> 01:11:10.336
If a man is holding a dagger
to your throat, minister?

01:11:10.436 --> 01:11:14.025
- Is it?
- I stand corrected. That's a demand.

01:11:15.725 --> 01:11:20.533
He has lost his mind.
He's found a God. His God.

01:11:21.464 --> 01:11:23.664
Not one of ours, so...

01:11:24.467 --> 01:11:28.237
I would like Moses...

01:11:31.332 --> 01:11:33.042
I want Moses dead.

01:11:36.212 --> 01:11:37.382
Did you hear me?

01:11:38.214 --> 01:11:39.382
Yes.

01:11:39.482 --> 01:11:42.002
Then, go.

01:11:43.878 --> 01:11:45.459
And...

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.060
His family, too.

01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.702
Moses. Where's Moses?

01:12:09.829 --> 01:12:12.369
Moses? Where's Moses?

01:12:54.724 --> 01:12:57.360
Moses... his family.

01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.800
Where are they?

01:13:22.168 --> 01:13:26.102
This is not Moses.

01:13:27.256 --> 01:13:30.376
This is not his family.

01:13:32.286 --> 01:13:36.299
This is a man, his wife,

01:13:36.499 --> 01:13:38.526
and his child...

01:13:38.626 --> 01:13:42.739
who when asked the simple question,
"where is he?",

01:13:42.839 --> 01:13:46.629
answered, "we don't know."

01:13:58.788 --> 01:14:02.191
Carry this image home with you tonight,

01:14:02.291 --> 01:14:05.069
and discuss why you would protect him

01:14:05.169 --> 01:14:08.656
knowing that tomorrow at this time

01:14:08.756 --> 01:14:13.336
there will be another family
where this one is.

01:14:13.436 --> 01:14:16.314
And another the day after.

01:14:16.614 --> 01:14:19.734
And the day after that.

01:14:20.951 --> 01:14:23.580
Dare I say yours?

01:14:36.809 --> 01:14:38.019
Go ahead.

01:14:40.146 --> 01:14:42.557
- I want to join the fight.
- In there.

01:14:50.156 --> 01:14:52.366
Joshua, use your knee.

01:15:01.334 --> 01:15:02.367
It's good.

01:15:27.318 --> 01:15:29.295
Both eyes open!

01:15:29.395 --> 01:15:30.946
Nock!

01:15:31.146 --> 01:15:32.874
Draw! Loose!

01:15:33.758 --> 01:15:37.484
Advance. Nock. Draw.

01:15:37.584 --> 01:15:38.878
Loose!

01:15:39.247 --> 01:15:40.607
Draw!

01:15:41.515 --> 01:15:43.104
Loose!

01:15:43.517 --> 01:15:45.884
Draw! Loose!

01:15:53.427 --> 01:15:54.347
Again!

01:16:01.443 --> 01:16:05.813
There are two kinds of warfare.
Each is dictated by numbers.

01:16:06.682 --> 01:16:10.970
With greater numbers
you attack the enemy head on!

01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:14.160
You stab it in the heart!

01:16:14.824 --> 01:16:20.803
With fewer numbers, you come at it
from the side. You cut off the blood...

01:16:21.163 --> 01:16:23.356
that pumps the heart.

01:16:23.808 --> 01:16:26.753
- The army supply lines.
- No!

01:16:27.353 --> 01:16:30.239
The people's supply lines. Their food,

01:16:30.339 --> 01:16:33.743
their property, their comfort.

01:16:33.843 --> 01:16:36.988
- What would that achieve?
- Everything.

01:16:37.088 --> 01:16:42.026
Only the Egyptian people
can force him to accept our demands

01:16:42.126 --> 01:16:45.186
for freedom. We must force them

01:16:45.605 --> 01:16:47.945
to make him say yes!

01:16:48.791 --> 01:16:50.857
- Yes?
- Yes!

01:16:51.194 --> 01:16:53.528
- Yes?
- Yes!

01:18:20.232 --> 01:18:21.535
With me!

01:18:21.751 --> 01:18:23.227
With me!

01:18:23.527 --> 01:18:25.119
Ready.

01:18:53.416 --> 01:18:55.896
You're not going to do anything?

01:18:57.737 --> 01:19:00.067
I didn't say that.

01:20:13.896 --> 01:20:17.171
- Where have you been?
- Watching you fail.

01:20:17.667 --> 01:20:20.136
Wars of attrition take time.

01:20:20.436 --> 01:20:24.015
At this rate, you'll take years...
a generation.

01:20:24.815 --> 01:20:28.718
- I am prepared to fight for that long.
- I'm not.

01:20:29.345 --> 01:20:32.470
I thought we were making progress.

01:20:33.583 --> 01:20:36.110
Now, you're impatient.

01:20:36.227 --> 01:20:40.607
After 400 years of slavery.

01:20:42.291 --> 01:20:46.261
Am I the only one sitting here
who's done nothing about this until now?

01:20:47.196 --> 01:20:51.058
I do know a few things
about military action.

01:20:51.158 --> 01:20:52.935
Still, if you're not going
to listen to me,

01:20:53.035 --> 01:20:56.037
then why did you take me away
from my family?

01:20:57.239 --> 01:21:00.568
I didn't. You did.

01:21:00.668 --> 01:21:02.708
You don't need me.

01:21:03.479 --> 01:21:05.377
Maybe not.

01:21:07.633 --> 01:21:09.223
So what do I do? Nothing?

01:21:10.052 --> 01:21:12.092
For now...

01:21:12.638 --> 01:21:14.348
you can watch.

01:22:55.491 --> 01:22:57.447
Divine goddess Kebechet,

01:22:57.547 --> 01:23:01.366
I humbly call upon you to purify
the waters of our life-giving river.

01:23:17.379 --> 01:23:19.890
How long will it take?

01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:21.679
Not long.

01:23:26.889 --> 01:23:29.169
But longer than that.

01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:05.799
Ramses! Ramses!

01:25:05.899 --> 01:25:07.467
Yes?

01:25:10.951 --> 01:25:13.696
- Enough!
- Do something!

01:25:13.896 --> 01:25:16.126
They're just frogs.

01:25:25.808 --> 01:25:27.752
Back away, back away.

01:25:27.852 --> 01:25:29.086
Unclean.

01:25:29.386 --> 01:25:31.648
No, no, no. Don't drink. Unclean.

01:26:03.387 --> 01:26:07.750
The Nile, as we know,
carries a certain amount of clay.

01:26:07.850 --> 01:26:11.753
This year there's much more of it
than usual. Drifting in on the currents,

01:26:11.853 --> 01:26:16.509
settling on the riverbeds, and kicked up
by the wild thrashing of the crocodiles.

01:26:16.809 --> 01:26:21.193
This thrashing not only dramatically
changed the color of the water,

01:26:21.293 --> 01:26:24.600
but it fouled it
to the point of killing the fish.

01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:26.936
But frogs, as we know,

01:26:27.036 --> 01:26:30.147
can get out of the water,
when they have to.

01:26:30.247 --> 01:26:34.694
Which they did.
But frogs still need water.

01:26:34.794 --> 01:26:37.554
And when they can't find it
in the streets of our city...

01:26:38.230 --> 01:26:40.120
they what?

01:26:41.133 --> 01:26:44.025
- They die?
- They die!

01:26:45.087 --> 01:26:46.557
And then they decompose.

01:26:46.657 --> 01:26:49.555
And then the gnats come
and the maggots come and the flies come.

01:26:50.759 --> 01:26:52.483
And then...

01:26:54.981 --> 01:26:56.571
And then what?

01:26:58.901 --> 01:26:59.941
The flies die.

01:27:44.588 --> 01:27:47.124
- Speak up.
- It's in Hebrew.

01:27:47.617 --> 01:27:50.561
Hebrew? Read it.

01:27:50.861 --> 01:27:53.940
"These catastrophes are the work of God.

01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:57.535
"And they have not finished.
They will get worse.

01:27:57.635 --> 01:28:00.917
"We need to reach a settlement
for both our sakes."

01:28:03.133 --> 01:28:05.983
So, the work of God.

01:28:09.889 --> 01:28:13.229
Here is my settlement to you.

01:28:13.601 --> 01:28:15.981
Work quotas shall be doubled,

01:28:16.437 --> 01:28:20.898
and you will get no straw
to make your bricks.

01:28:21.517 --> 01:28:25.147
Perhaps your God
will provide it for you.

01:28:53.324 --> 01:28:55.954
I was impressed at first.

01:28:56.452 --> 01:28:58.612
Not anymore.

01:29:00.122 --> 01:29:01.872
This is affecting everyone.

01:29:03.751 --> 01:29:06.041
So, who are you punishing?

01:29:21.869 --> 01:29:23.955
What's wrong with him?

01:29:27.108 --> 01:29:28.528
It's sick.

01:29:35.116 --> 01:29:37.101
What is this?

01:29:37.201 --> 01:29:39.103
- Did you do this?
- Not me. Not me.

01:29:39.203 --> 01:29:40.373
- Is this you?
- No, no!

01:29:41.268 --> 01:29:42.481
Wake up, please.

01:29:42.581 --> 01:29:44.838
What's happened to him?

01:30:16.449 --> 01:30:19.518
We have made great strides in medicine.

01:30:19.618 --> 01:30:23.856
However, there are still a few hidden
diseases that we don't completely understand.

01:30:23.956 --> 01:30:28.694
Animals are not exempt,
and there is some conjecture

01:30:28.794 --> 01:30:33.332
that these maladies can migrate
from the smallest creature.

01:30:33.432 --> 01:30:36.294
- Like a...
- A fly.

01:30:43.526 --> 01:30:45.836
Have you been out to the river lately?

01:30:45.936 --> 01:30:50.302
I appealed to Kebechet again
and six more gods.

01:32:00.970 --> 01:32:02.930
Is that it?

01:32:05.349 --> 01:32:06.829
Are you done?

01:32:12.565 --> 01:32:14.355
I am.

01:32:24.702 --> 01:32:29.204
Are you trying to say something
with your absence?

01:32:30.091 --> 01:32:32.485
Is it meant to humble me?

01:32:32.785 --> 01:32:35.749
Because it will not!

01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:43.472
Initial reports suggest

01:33:43.572 --> 01:33:47.082
more than 10 million square cubits
of crops have been lost.

01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:52.714
The quartermaster has suggested
we return a portion of the supplement

01:33:52.814 --> 01:33:56.523
to the civil granary. An act of mercy.

01:33:57.336 --> 01:33:58.849
Your people are starving.

01:33:59.964 --> 01:34:02.934
Are you suggesting
that I should starve, too?

01:34:03.592 --> 01:34:04.552
No.

01:34:06.804 --> 01:34:10.154
People have plenty of water.

01:34:10.366 --> 01:34:12.270
They will endure.

01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:50.225
Aim!

01:34:51.532 --> 01:34:52.791
Fire!

01:34:57.313 --> 01:34:58.113
Aim!

01:34:58.956 --> 01:35:00.283
Fire!

01:35:54.011 --> 01:35:56.031
Is that you?

01:35:57.581 --> 01:35:58.941
Moses?

01:36:00.643 --> 01:36:02.283
Brother?

01:36:07.341 --> 01:36:10.621
Have you come to negotiate?

01:36:12.596 --> 01:36:14.756
Because I'm ready...

01:36:15.224 --> 01:36:17.764
as I have an offer for you.

01:36:19.061 --> 01:36:21.841
One more thing happens...

01:36:22.732 --> 01:36:27.292
and I will bring my own plague to you.

01:36:28.571 --> 01:36:31.265
You see, every Hebrew child...

01:36:31.365 --> 01:36:33.935
not yet walking...

01:36:34.201 --> 01:36:35.391
they never shall.

01:36:36.579 --> 01:36:39.999
Because I will drown them in The Nile.

01:36:41.250 --> 01:36:43.280
As you should have been.

01:36:46.188 --> 01:36:50.978
You say that you didn't cause all this?

01:36:51.761 --> 01:36:54.001
Your God did?

01:36:56.057 --> 01:36:59.287
I am the God! I am the God!

01:37:03.856 --> 01:37:08.276
So, let's just see
who's more effective at killing.

01:37:09.028 --> 01:37:10.738
You.

01:37:11.072 --> 01:37:12.932
This God.

01:37:14.784 --> 01:37:16.024
Or me.

01:37:37.431 --> 01:37:39.141
Nice of you to come.

01:37:40.309 --> 01:37:42.559
He's given you what you asked?

01:37:46.482 --> 01:37:49.135
Not yet. But his own people
are turning against him.

01:37:49.235 --> 01:37:51.304
- And his army?
- It will.

01:37:51.404 --> 01:37:53.114
I disagree.

01:37:54.089 --> 01:37:57.125
- Something worse has to happen.
- I disagree.

01:37:57.451 --> 01:38:00.646
- Anything more would be...
- Would be what?

01:38:00.746 --> 01:38:04.456
What were you about to say?
Cruel? Inhumane?

01:38:04.792 --> 01:38:10.698
It's not easy to see the people who
I grew up with suffering this much.

01:38:10.798 --> 01:38:12.700
What about the people you
didn't grow up with?

01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:15.572
What thought did you give to them?

01:38:16.345 --> 01:38:18.925
You still don't think of them
as yours, do you?

01:38:20.683 --> 01:38:24.003
As long as Ramses has an army
behind him, nothing will change.

01:38:24.103 --> 01:38:26.544
- Anything more is just revenge!
- Revenge?

01:38:26.644 --> 01:38:30.493
After 400 years of brutal subjugation?

01:38:30.593 --> 01:38:33.265
These pharaohs who imagine
they're living gods,

01:38:33.365 --> 01:38:35.264
they're nothing more
than flesh and blood.

01:38:35.364 --> 01:38:39.435
I want to see them on their knees,
begging for it to stop!

01:38:39.535 --> 01:38:42.063
I'm tired of talking with a messenger!

01:38:45.875 --> 01:38:47.295
General!

01:38:48.627 --> 01:38:52.081
I have heard Ramses' final threat.

01:38:52.281 --> 01:38:54.681
So, let me tell you
what's going to happen next.

01:38:57.887 --> 01:39:01.458
No. No. You cannot do this.

01:39:01.849 --> 01:39:04.089
I want no part of this!

01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:31.476
Stay!

01:39:32.021 --> 01:39:34.767
- Hold!
- Moses?

01:39:36.425 --> 01:39:37.465
Leave him.

01:39:44.658 --> 01:39:47.268
- Khyan.
- Moses.

01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:04.410
I could have you killed.

01:40:05.079 --> 01:40:07.275
I don't think so.

01:40:08.332 --> 01:40:10.462
Unless you do it yourself.

01:40:10.918 --> 01:40:13.998
Your own soldiers let me in.

01:40:17.758 --> 01:40:19.994
I am not negotiating anymore.

01:40:20.094 --> 01:40:22.774
That's not why I'm here.

01:40:23.639 --> 01:40:27.809
I came to tell you
that something is coming

01:40:28.144 --> 01:40:30.880
that is out of my control.

01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:34.050
Something that will affect thousands

01:40:34.150 --> 01:40:38.039
and thousands of citizens.
And it will affect you very personally

01:40:38.139 --> 01:40:40.356
unless you accept what I've asked for,

01:40:41.031 --> 01:40:43.601
and announce it publicly

01:40:43.701 --> 01:40:47.241
before the sun goes down.

01:40:50.166 --> 01:40:55.037
Ramses... do not turn your back on me!

01:40:57.423 --> 01:41:01.893
This has nothing to do with you and I.

01:41:02.344 --> 01:41:05.564
This is far beyond that.

01:41:05.848 --> 01:41:08.558
This is about Egypt's survival.
Do you understand?

01:41:14.732 --> 01:41:16.792
Sunset.

01:41:17.693 --> 01:41:19.662
After that, it will be too late.

01:41:20.529 --> 01:41:22.264
What will be too late?

01:41:22.464 --> 01:41:25.184
You protect your child.

01:41:25.368 --> 01:41:27.698
You protect your child tonight.

01:41:28.312 --> 01:41:30.242
My child?

01:41:31.516 --> 01:41:33.656
Is that a threat?

01:41:37.914 --> 01:41:41.254
Is that a threat? Moses!

01:41:42.051 --> 01:41:43.301
Moses!

01:41:46.889 --> 01:41:49.009
Tell everyone

01:41:49.475 --> 01:41:51.565
to slaughter a lamb.

01:41:52.228 --> 01:41:54.213
And mark their doors,

01:41:54.313 --> 01:41:58.232
and their doorposts tonight
with its blood.

01:42:00.444 --> 01:42:01.494
Why?

01:42:02.087 --> 01:42:05.437
Pity the lambs if I am wrong.

01:42:07.618 --> 01:42:09.812
If I'm right...

01:42:09.912 --> 01:42:12.792
we will bless them for eternity.

01:44:31.721 --> 01:44:34.431
Bennu? Bennu?

01:45:25.608 --> 01:45:27.615
No!

01:45:30.404 --> 01:45:32.314
Ramses?

01:45:33.157 --> 01:45:34.996
Ramses.

01:45:37.828 --> 01:45:39.688
Ramses.

01:45:56.764 --> 01:45:58.544
No!

01:46:03.521 --> 01:46:05.481
Zechariah?

01:46:11.587 --> 01:46:13.657
Zechariah?

01:46:52.987 --> 01:46:54.357
Kneel!

01:47:13.382 --> 01:47:14.592
Get out!

01:47:15.551 --> 01:47:17.571
Murderer!

01:47:17.854 --> 01:47:20.244
Child killer!

01:47:30.649 --> 01:47:34.669
Their children died last night.

01:47:35.863 --> 01:47:37.073
As did mine.

01:47:41.911 --> 01:47:44.041
Is this your God?

01:47:46.749 --> 01:47:49.079
A killer of children?

01:47:49.835 --> 01:47:53.585
What kind of fanatics
worship such a God?

01:48:01.097 --> 01:48:03.427
No Hebrew child died last night.

01:48:23.953 --> 01:48:25.685
Get...

01:48:25.955 --> 01:48:27.465
out.

01:48:28.290 --> 01:48:30.020
Go.

01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:33.321
Every one of you!

01:48:33.421 --> 01:48:34.461
Go!

01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:40.280
Go to Canaan if that's what you want.

01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:43.256
Back to the homeland of your dreams.

01:48:43.773 --> 01:48:45.843
But go!

01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:51.060
As you command.

01:49:03.034 --> 01:49:05.645
This is the route I took.

01:49:05.745 --> 01:49:09.958
From here, we go South to the red sea.
The straits are here.

01:49:10.058 --> 01:49:12.552
At low tide, we can cross on foot.

01:50:49.932 --> 01:50:53.092
You know why you sleep so well, my boy?

01:50:55.146 --> 01:50:58.006
Because you know you are loved.

01:51:50.092 --> 01:51:54.088
With respect, if we're going to
recapture 400,000 slaves,

01:51:54.188 --> 01:51:57.316
we might need more than three divisions.

01:51:57.416 --> 01:51:59.496
We're not recapturing anyone.

01:52:03.255 --> 01:52:04.545
Forward!

01:52:43.379 --> 01:52:46.115
- We should rest.
- No.

01:52:46.215 --> 01:52:49.099
We're not safe until we cross the sea.

01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:53.560
Moshe!

01:52:57.935 --> 01:52:59.545
Ramses...

01:52:59.645 --> 01:53:03.688
- 4,000 men... a thousand chariots.
- How far behind us?

01:53:04.150 --> 01:53:07.488
Four days.
Less, if they don't rest the horses.

01:53:15.161 --> 01:53:16.291
Ramses!

01:53:17.038 --> 01:53:18.978
Ramses!

01:53:19.248 --> 01:53:23.007
We need to rest the horses, and the men!

01:53:35.056 --> 01:53:39.302
The straits are that way.
The longest, easiest route

01:53:39.402 --> 01:53:42.132
is down the Western coast.

01:53:43.773 --> 01:53:47.533
Or we go through the mountains.

01:53:49.111 --> 01:53:54.016
The mountains? Why?
Why don't we take that route?

01:53:54.116 --> 01:53:56.795
We can, but so can Ramses.

01:53:56.895 --> 01:54:01.775
The Mountain passes are dangerous,
but they are too narrow

01:54:01.875 --> 01:54:05.614
for Ramses' chariots. He couldn't follow.
That would give us needed time.

01:54:07.438 --> 01:54:09.913
What does God tell you?

01:54:15.012 --> 01:54:16.432
The mountains.

01:54:17.515 --> 01:54:19.775
Can we make it?

01:54:25.815 --> 01:54:27.575
Forward!

01:55:08.357 --> 01:55:10.007
Which way from here?

01:55:13.654 --> 01:55:15.614
Stay here.

01:55:35.176 --> 01:55:37.448
We need your help.

01:55:45.644 --> 01:55:48.214
I don't know where I am.

01:56:11.921 --> 01:56:14.157
You won't help me?

01:56:16.467 --> 01:56:19.012
You won't help them.

01:56:23.432 --> 01:56:25.522
This way!

01:56:28.729 --> 01:56:30.609
Move out!

01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:51.180
This way!

01:56:53.421 --> 01:56:57.366
- Are you sure?
- I'm very sure.

01:56:57.466 --> 01:57:01.779
I mean, are you sure we can make it across
with our equipment... our chariots?

01:57:01.879 --> 01:57:04.256
They didn't think they could
with theirs.

01:57:05.975 --> 01:57:07.525
How would they know?

01:57:08.352 --> 01:57:10.281
They've never been here.

01:57:10.381 --> 01:57:12.136
Moses may have.

01:57:53.564 --> 01:57:57.596
- Is this high tide or low tide?
- Doesn't matter.

01:57:58.319 --> 01:58:01.366
- This isn't the straits, is it?
- No.

01:58:04.283 --> 01:58:07.311
- Do you even know where we are?
- Yes!

01:58:07.411 --> 01:58:12.441
We're at a point on the earth where
there is a sea ahead, and an army behind!

01:58:12.541 --> 01:58:14.360
So now what?

01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:17.895
Army or no army we have to rest.

01:58:42.196 --> 01:58:44.816
I have misled all of them.

01:58:46.033 --> 01:58:49.353
I have abandoned my family.

01:58:50.454 --> 01:58:52.524
I have failed you.

01:58:57.545 --> 01:59:00.215
I'm not what I thought I was.

02:01:56.307 --> 02:01:57.427
What is it?

02:01:58.934 --> 02:02:00.504
The current.

02:02:03.856 --> 02:02:05.896
It's strong.

02:02:13.741 --> 02:02:16.212
We need to cross here.

02:02:18.621 --> 02:02:21.067
We need to cross now!

02:02:24.585 --> 02:02:27.650
We cross here. We cross here!

02:02:29.148 --> 02:02:31.736
Ready yourselves! We cross here!

02:02:32.426 --> 02:02:34.745
Go tell them! Go!

02:02:34.845 --> 02:02:39.726
Your orders are like the lash
of the Egyptian whip.

02:02:40.476 --> 02:02:44.725
- We are no longer slaves.
- And yet, you are not free.

02:02:46.273 --> 02:02:49.090
You have lost sight of Canaan...

02:02:50.069 --> 02:02:52.609
land of your forebears.

02:02:54.198 --> 02:02:58.225
You have honored me with your trust.

02:02:59.161 --> 02:03:01.991
Now I honor you with my faith.

02:03:04.166 --> 02:03:07.106
Follow me and you will be free!

02:03:07.586 --> 02:03:10.296
Stay and you will perish.

02:03:12.842 --> 02:03:15.052
Do not be afraid!

02:03:16.053 --> 02:03:20.806
God is with us! Go! Ready yourselves!

02:03:20.906 --> 02:03:23.669
Go! God is with us!

02:03:23.769 --> 02:03:27.809
Pass the word! We cross here!

02:03:28.315 --> 02:03:33.538
As quickly as you can,
gather your things, and form in groups!

02:03:36.532 --> 02:03:38.580
Quickly!

02:03:45.541 --> 02:03:47.711
Come on!

02:04:36.717 --> 02:04:37.684
Steady!

02:04:43.449 --> 02:04:45.889
To the right, to the right! Tight!

02:05:12.044 --> 02:05:14.404
Keep moving!

02:05:15.005 --> 02:05:17.085
There's nothing to fear!

02:05:20.010 --> 02:05:22.140
Don't worry! You'll be safe!

02:05:44.869 --> 02:05:47.829
Keep to the right! Keep to the right!

02:05:52.168 --> 02:05:54.228
Ramses!

02:06:27.536 --> 02:06:29.022
Stop!

02:06:51.477 --> 02:06:54.307
Stop! Stop!

02:07:12.832 --> 02:07:14.292
Go.

02:07:16.794 --> 02:07:20.777
Keep moving! Keep moving! Forward!

02:07:50.369 --> 02:07:51.289
There.

02:08:13.392 --> 02:08:16.301
Joshua! Aaron!

02:08:31.494 --> 02:08:34.410
Run! Everyone, run!

02:08:34.789 --> 02:08:35.982
Move!

02:08:36.082 --> 02:08:38.186
Run to shore!

02:09:24.964 --> 02:09:25.884
Moshe.

02:10:28.444 --> 02:10:29.614
Moshe.

02:10:33.849 --> 02:10:36.217
We must leave!

02:10:39.538 --> 02:10:42.193
Ramses! Ramses!

02:10:47.588 --> 02:10:50.301
- Go!
- Ramses, stop!

02:10:58.015 --> 02:11:01.252
All! Turn around!

02:11:01.352 --> 02:11:04.046
Turn around!

02:11:04.146 --> 02:11:06.056
Khyan!

02:11:12.863 --> 02:11:14.283
Leave.

02:11:14.657 --> 02:11:17.426
- Brother...
- Leave now! That's an order!

02:11:43.018 --> 02:11:47.008
Come! You'll never make it back!

02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:05.750
Go!

02:12:12.381 --> 02:12:13.991
Faster!

02:14:34.607 --> 02:14:35.977
It's just me here.

02:14:44.367 --> 02:14:46.027
Sit.

02:14:52.291 --> 02:14:54.560
My family...

02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:56.445
is not far from here.

02:14:56.545 --> 02:15:00.046
- Your family?
- My other family. My wife, my son.

02:15:01.550 --> 02:15:06.471
I was thinking
maybe I could convince them...

02:15:06.722 --> 02:15:10.492
convince them to join us,
but perhaps that's...

02:15:10.935 --> 02:15:14.171
- Perhaps that's not wise.
- Of course they should come.

02:15:14.271 --> 02:15:17.818
We have a long way to go.
A lot can happen.

02:15:18.317 --> 02:15:19.747
And then...

02:15:20.403 --> 02:15:22.596
we get there, if we get there.

02:15:22.696 --> 02:15:25.264
You don't think they'll
let us settle in Canaan?

02:15:25.366 --> 02:15:27.576
They'll see us as invaders.

02:15:28.119 --> 02:15:31.164
They won't have a choice.
We're as big as any tribe.

02:15:31.264 --> 02:15:34.124
We're as big as a nation of tribes
and that concerns me even more.

02:15:34.625 --> 02:15:35.955
Why?

02:15:37.169 --> 02:15:39.572
This many people?

02:15:39.672 --> 02:15:41.622
You have to ask?

02:15:44.343 --> 02:15:47.218
- But we all have the same goal.
- We do now.

02:15:48.472 --> 02:15:51.322
What happens when we stop running?

02:16:15.416 --> 02:16:17.538
Ramses...

02:16:18.277 --> 02:16:20.717
The Great.

02:16:29.805 --> 02:16:31.795
Thank you.

02:16:57.249 --> 02:16:58.419
Gershom.

02:17:49.885 --> 02:17:52.135
Did you do what you said?

02:17:53.138 --> 02:17:55.119
What did I say?

02:17:56.433 --> 02:17:59.234
That you would trade your faith...

02:18:00.671 --> 02:18:02.731
to keep me.

02:18:03.132 --> 02:18:04.826
No.

02:18:07.318 --> 02:18:09.347
Good.

02:18:09.447 --> 02:18:12.387
You may need it more than ever now.

02:18:25.129 --> 02:18:27.419
Who are they?

02:18:28.758 --> 02:18:31.013
They're my people.

02:18:38.768 --> 02:18:40.998
Who makes you happy?

02:18:43.439 --> 02:18:45.307
You do.

02:18:45.648 --> 02:18:49.359
What is the most important thing
in your life?

02:18:50.529 --> 02:18:52.012
You are.

02:18:52.156 --> 02:18:54.016
You are.

02:18:57.827 --> 02:18:59.618
When will I leave you?

02:19:02.608 --> 02:19:04.600
Never.

02:19:08.364 --> 02:19:10.224
May I proceed?

02:19:12.802 --> 02:19:14.791
Proceed.

02:20:38.821 --> 02:20:40.311
What do you think of this?

02:20:41.991 --> 02:20:45.483
I wouldn't do it if I didn't agree.

02:20:47.396 --> 02:20:49.351
That's true.

02:20:49.815 --> 02:20:52.275
I've noticed that about you.

02:20:52.835 --> 02:20:55.355
You don't always agree with me.

02:20:55.946 --> 02:20:59.242
Nor you me, I've noticed.

02:20:59.342 --> 02:21:03.062
Yet here we are, still speaking.

02:21:03.454 --> 02:21:05.484
But not for much longer.

02:21:09.418 --> 02:21:12.647
A leader can falter, but stone...

02:21:13.731 --> 02:21:15.562
will endure.

02:21:16.258 --> 02:21:20.367
These laws will guide them
in your stead.

02:21:21.305 --> 02:21:26.212
If you disagree
you should put down the hammer.
