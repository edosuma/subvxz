<i>- Got something for me?
- Right here.</i>

00:25.670 --> 00:29.641
<i>- Everything cool?
- Yeah.</i>

00:33.678 --> 00:35.344
Hey, there.

00:36.416 --> 00:37.516
You got a second?

00:47.127 --> 00:50.863
- Tell me!
- It's just me, I swear!

00:53.033 --> 00:56.101
No one else knows ...
I swear!

01:23.735 --> 01:25.868
<i>Didn't you just detail it?</i>

01:25.903 --> 01:28.270
The only time I wash my car
is right before I sell it.

01:28.305 --> 01:31.040
It only has to be detailed again
because you spilled

01:31.041 --> 01:33.576
your triple power latte,
and it smells like a deco.

01:33.610 --> 01:35.711
- What's deco?
- A decomposing body.

01:35.746 --> 01:38.448
- How do you know it was me?
- You know, europeans have it right.

01:38.482 --> 01:41.118
Car engineers design
them without cup holders.

01:41.152 --> 01:42.286
Where do you put your coffee?

01:42.320 --> 01:46.291
You drink it at a cafÃ©.
You do not slosh it around in your car.

01:46.325 --> 01:48.927
<i>I don't slosh,
and where are you going?</i>

01:48.961 --> 01:52.464
To a rave with your friends
Atticus and Tallulah?

01:52.498 --> 01:55.769
No, feels more like
Cafe Ace with London rockers.

01:55.803 --> 01:58.639
Can you two go inspect someone else?

01:58.673 --> 02:00.775
- That's very yellow.
- Thank you.

02:00.809 --> 02:04.445
You know, you should be very careful
around ovulating women.

02:04.479 --> 02:07.365
The University of Texas study
determined that ovulating women

02:07.366 --> 02:10.485
are attracted to biker types
in order to fertilize their eggs.

02:10.519 --> 02:12.287
Ha!
Explains what happened

02:12.321 --> 02:14.623
with, uh, me and your father.

02:14.657 --> 02:19.061
- Whoa, pop rode a motorcycle?
- I'd rather not remember.

02:20.264 --> 02:23.633
I thought if I looked the part,
I might get a U.C. assignment faster.

02:23.668 --> 02:25.436
Did you hear
we have a new boss at DCU?

02:25.470 --> 02:27.805
- You ever meet him, Jane? Lieutenant ...
- Rafael Martinez.

02:27.839 --> 02:30.273
It's been a long time, Rizzoli.

02:36.515 --> 02:38.849
Rafi, when did you crawl
out from under the covers?

02:38.884 --> 02:40.117
Vinnie!
{ speaks Spanish }

02:41.353 --> 02:42.454
{ speaking Spanish }

02:42.488 --> 02:46.858
- I don't think we ever met, sir.
- So, you're the other Rizzoli.

02:46.892 --> 02:48.793
Yeah, yeah, I guess so, sir.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.032
Okay, other Rizzoli.
My office in 10.

02:54.066 --> 02:55.066
Sure.

02:56.703 --> 02:58.070
- Did you two ...
- Maura, not now.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.674
Frankie.

03:01.708 --> 03:04.411
- Oh, I cannot get a break.
- Frankie, come on!

03:04.478 --> 03:05.745
What did you two do?

03:05.846 --> 03:08.715
I have to get this. Don't you?

03:08.749 --> 03:09.916
Rizzoli.

03:09.984 --> 03:11.318
- Dr. Isles.
- Jane!

03:11.352 --> 03:12.085
Yeah, we'll be right there.

03:12.153 --> 03:14.054
- Jane!
- Bye, Ma.

03:39.916 --> 03:41.417
<i>Well, thanks to you, I don't have</i>

03:41.451 --> 03:44.253
a change of clothes in my car ...
it's getting ... detailed.

03:44.288 --> 03:46.556
How many times do you
want me to apologize?

03:46.590 --> 03:49.592
Here. You can borrow these.

03:49.626 --> 03:53.263
Fine.
Ruin your $200 Zambonis.

03:53.297 --> 03:56.900
Zanottis. These are Giuseppe
Zanottis. They're $550.

03:56.934 --> 04:00.303
550 bucks! I Hope they gave
you the rest of the cow.

04:00.338 --> 04:02.305
You know, for that, they
should give you the whole herd.

04:05.644 --> 04:08.212
Mother... phooey.

04:08.246 --> 04:10.047
- Morning, Sergeant.
- Morning.

04:10.082 --> 04:14.218
- So, Martinez is back, huh?
- It'll be fine.

04:17.055 --> 04:20.952
- Oh, no, it's wicking.
- Oh, no. What's wicking?

04:21.660 --> 04:23.461
It's being absorbed into the leather.

04:23.495 --> 04:27.765
<i>Well, that wouldn't have happened
if you were wearing these.</i>

04:35.474 --> 04:39.645
<i>We got a good, old jurisdictional
turf war with the staties.</i>

04:39.679 --> 04:43.181
Tide is going out.
Body'll be on the sand in 15 minutes.

04:43.282 --> 04:44.449
We'll have to work this
case with the state police.

04:44.484 --> 04:45.617
That is bullshit.

04:45.651 --> 04:47.319
Why do they get jurisdiction
over the beaches?

04:47.353 --> 04:50.121
All right, we got to get her
to float back into BPD territory.

04:50.155 --> 04:51.923
We can't move the body now, Jane.

04:51.957 --> 04:54.293
<i>Hey, Rizzoli!
Since we got this,</i>

04:54.327 --> 04:55.927
<i>you mind grabbing us some coffee?</i>

04:55.962 --> 04:58.329
Oh, yeah, sure, right after
I solve this homicide, okay?

04:59.832 --> 05:04.201
- I can't stand Bob Thatcher.
- Yeah, officious and competitive.

05:04.303 --> 05:06.370
Want to help me twist
off his balding head?

05:06.438 --> 05:07.805
Can we make it look like a suicide?

05:08.874 --> 05:12.844
I never liked him, either.
The body is almost on the beach.

05:12.878 --> 05:14.879
<i>I guess I'm gonna be working
this with the state police.</i>

05:17.583 --> 05:20.519
Oh, my gosh, look, Maura!
There's a ... there's a horseshoe crab!

05:20.554 --> 05:21.954
<i>- Right there!
- Where?</i>

05:21.989 --> 05:24.490
- Right there!
- Yeah, yeah, I see one right there.

05:25.526 --> 05:28.360
There haven't been any horseshoe
crabs in Dorchester bay in 25 years.

05:28.395 --> 05:30.463
They're back.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.131
Oh, look, there's
another one right there!

05:32.166 --> 05:33.666
<i>Now, be careful.
They're endangered.</i>

05:33.700 --> 05:34.901
What? Where?

05:35.002 --> 05:36.135
I haven't seen one
since I was a little kid.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.038
Dr. Isles, I ... I think I see an egg.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.673
Okay!

05:40.707 --> 05:45.544
<i>You are in a delicate mating area
of the limulus polyphemus!</i>

05:45.579 --> 05:51.484
<i>Okay, I need crime-scene tape
and barricades now! Hurry!</i>

05:57.924 --> 06:01.760
Oh, look at that! She's in the surf!
Guess this one's ours!

06:01.861 --> 06:04.229
Oh, that's cute, Rizzoli!
That's real cute!

06:04.264 --> 06:05.664
Listen,
since you're not doing anything,

06:05.698 --> 06:08.700
Can you grab me a triple power latte?!

06:08.735 --> 06:11.770
- Thank you!
- Korsak.

06:11.838 --> 06:15.340
- She's so young.
- We didn't find any I.D. on her.

06:15.374 --> 06:18.910
We also didn't find any horseshoe crabs.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.913
I'm sorry. It was all I could think of.

06:20.947 --> 06:23.015
<i>It's pretty symmetrical gashes.</i>

06:23.049 --> 06:24.816
I mean, these aren't
from banging into pilings.

06:24.851 --> 06:27.686
Look at this.
It takes a lot of force

06:27.720 --> 06:29.087
to pull hair from the scalp right there.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.457
Somebody slammed her
head into something.

06:31.524 --> 06:32.691
You think that's what killed her?

06:32.726 --> 06:35.761
Well, froth in the nose and mouth
indicates drowning,

06:35.795 --> 06:37.396
but I'll need to do a full autopsy.

06:37.430 --> 06:40.132
You're gonna have a hell of a time
pulling prints off of her.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.600
Early stage maceration.

06:41.634 --> 06:44.269
A saline injection
should restore fingerpads.

06:44.303 --> 06:47.740
- How long was she in the water?
- Floaters are a unique challenge.

06:47.774 --> 06:51.710
The ocean is a very effective
medium for destroying forensics.

06:51.745 --> 06:55.448
- How did I know you'd say that?
- I'll give you a window.

06:55.482 --> 06:57.316
She was in the water for 8 to 10 hours.

06:57.384 --> 06:58.951
Given the tidal flow and the current,

06:58.985 --> 07:01.220
she was dumped from
somewhere inside the harbor.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.555
Saw that from
the crow's nest, did you, sailor?

07:03.590 --> 07:07.126
I'm not even gonna dignify that
with an answer, gym rat.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.628
I know that because she's
not halfway to Bermuda.

07:09.696 --> 07:12.064
Inside the harbor?
That's still a big area to cover.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.633
We got to find the crime scene
where this poor girl was killed.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.674
You're still wearing my boots.
You know I want 'em back.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.776
Now?
They're so comfortable.

07:23.811 --> 07:24.911
Okay, fine. You can keep 'em.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.145
- Really?
- Yes.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.981
As long as you promise to wear them
with all your yellow outfits.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.116
I will change out of them
as soon as I get a minute.

07:33.887 --> 07:37.622
Hey, Maura,
what is this abrasion?

07:37.656 --> 07:39.924
It's sticky.

07:43.462 --> 07:46.164
What is Martinez doing down here?

07:46.198 --> 07:49.500
Uh, well, DCU's evidence
is getting processed in-house now.

07:49.534 --> 07:50.701
What happened with him?

07:50.802 --> 07:53.237
<i>Can we talk about this
when he's not ten feet away?</i>

07:53.271 --> 07:54.505
<i>Dr. Isles.</i>

07:54.539 --> 07:57.475
I should have introduced myself.
Rafael Martinez.

07:57.509 --> 07:59.677
It's a little overwhelming
coming back here

07:59.778 --> 08:00.945
after being gone for so long.

08:00.979 --> 08:03.648
Gone?
So, you're returning to BPD?

08:05.285 --> 08:08.786
And here I thought Detective Rizzoli
had told you all about me.

08:08.820 --> 08:10.788
It didn't even occur to me.

08:10.822 --> 08:12.823
<i>It's very nice of you
to introduce yourself.</i>

08:12.858 --> 08:16.794
If you need anything,
feel free to contact me or my staff.

08:16.828 --> 08:18.462
Thank you.

08:25.070 --> 08:28.840
I finally get promoted to Detective,
and my boss hates Rizzolis.

08:28.874 --> 08:31.309
Hey, thanks, Jane.

08:41.405 --> 08:43.239
Well, maybe it's
not maybe it's police work.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.807
No, it's Rizzolis.

08:46.309 --> 08:47.442
You slept with Rafael.

08:48.778 --> 08:52.314
- We didn't sleep, Maura.
- Oh, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

08:52.348 --> 08:55.817
Rafael is very attractive.
You're very attractive.

08:55.852 --> 08:57.819
Rafael wasn't your boss, was he?

08:57.854 --> 09:01.156
Can you please stop calling
him Rafael? And, no, he wasn't.

09:01.190 --> 09:04.226
- Rafael is his name.
- In a harlequin romance.

09:04.261 --> 09:05.961
At work, here, it's Martinez.

09:06.029 --> 09:08.664
Okay, so, other than
in the biblical sense,

09:08.698 --> 09:09.865
how do you know Lieutenant Martinez?

09:11.034 --> 09:13.402
We worked together when I
started in the drug unit.

09:13.437 --> 09:16.538
We had to play a couple
and go to clubs

09:16.606 --> 09:20.209
and dance and blend in
and drink and bust people.

09:20.276 --> 09:22.544
I was hoping I'd never see him again.

09:22.579 --> 09:25.681
Oh, no.
Jane, was he married?

09:25.748 --> 09:29.717
No.
Actually, that would have been easier.

09:29.785 --> 09:32.787
We got my C.I. killed.

09:34.723 --> 09:38.660
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, and then we had a falling out,

09:38.728 --> 09:41.696
and then he took an assignment
with a federal task force,

09:41.731 --> 09:44.299
and that was eight years ago,
and I haven't seen him since.

09:46.235 --> 09:48.870
Dr. Isles?
Your sister's upstairs.

09:48.904 --> 09:51.406
- My sister?
- That's what she said.

09:51.440 --> 09:52.807
You do have a sister, Maura.

09:52.842 --> 09:57.779
Oh, right. Yes, tell Cailin
to wait for me in the cafÃ©.

09:57.813 --> 10:00.548
You know, you're a little
harlequin romance-y yourself.

10:00.582 --> 10:03.151
- What do you mean?
- Well, in the space of two years,

10:03.218 --> 10:05.286
you found out your
biological dad is a gangster

10:05.320 --> 10:06.954
who's about to star in
his own R.I.C.O. trial,

10:06.989 --> 10:09.357
<i>and mom, a renowned humanitarian,</i>

10:09.391 --> 10:11.159
who is nice to everyone but you.

10:11.260 --> 10:13.161
<i>What else? Let's see. Am
I forgetting something?</i>

10:13.195 --> 10:15.397
I gave my kidney to a
half-sister I don't know.

10:15.464 --> 10:18.067
I think I'm more of
s Dickensian character.

10:18.101 --> 10:20.402
Yeah, or a really good
guest on "Jerry Springer."

10:20.436 --> 10:23.572
- Come on.
- Where am I going?

10:23.606 --> 10:24.973
To offer moral support

10:25.008 --> 10:27.042
in case Cailin wants
another one of my organs.

10:27.077 --> 10:32.546
- No, thanks. Unless...
- Unless what?

10:37.320 --> 10:38.420
Love your wellies.

10:38.454 --> 10:40.789
You drive a hard bargain.
Cailin.

10:42.125 --> 10:44.860
What a surprise.
You shouldn't bite your nails.

10:44.895 --> 10:46.796
It's very unsanitary
and bad for your teeth.

10:46.830 --> 10:48.799
<i>You'll have to excuse her.</i>

10:48.833 --> 10:51.001
Believe it or not, you make
your big sister nervous.

10:51.035 --> 10:53.937
- Me? Why?
- Well, she wants you to like her.

10:53.971 --> 10:56.773
25% of all young
adults bite their nails.

10:56.808 --> 10:59.543
- You'll grow out of it.
- See? It's nerves.

11:00.545 --> 11:01.979
Sorry. Sorry.

11:02.013 --> 11:04.348
No, I'm ... I'm sorry
to just show up here.

11:04.383 --> 11:07.284
- Would you like to talk to Maura alone?
- No. I'm glad you're here.

11:07.319 --> 11:10.170
It's about my Mom.
Our Mom.

11:10.222 --> 11:12.690
- You want to sit down?
- Yeah.

11:16.061 --> 11:18.896
- Is she all right?
- I'm not sure.

11:18.930 --> 11:22.066
- Some men came by the house last night.
- What kind of men?

11:22.100 --> 11:24.635
Scary ones.
I mean, they wore suits,

11:24.670 --> 11:26.204
but they had this, like, dark energy.

11:26.238 --> 11:29.774
Well, do you know what they wanted?
- No, but they seemed pissed.

11:29.809 --> 11:31.910
She told me to go to my
room and lock my door.

11:31.945 --> 11:34.380
- Lock your door?
- They were talking pretty quietly,

11:34.448 --> 11:36.349
but I heard them ask her about M.E.N.D.

11:36.383 --> 11:39.986
Medical Emergency Network of Doctors.
That's Hope's charity.

11:40.021 --> 11:41.521
Well, could it have
been about fundraising?

11:41.589 --> 11:44.024
It sounded like they
were threatening her.

11:44.058 --> 11:46.393
She says we're going back to London.

11:46.428 --> 11:48.162
Well, isn't that a good idea?
I thought you missed London.

11:48.196 --> 11:50.464
I love it here now.

11:50.532 --> 11:54.468
But... I don't know.
It's too full of ghosts for her.

11:56.505 --> 11:59.907
I ... I don't mean you.

12:01.742 --> 12:06.112
- You mean Paddy Doyle?
- Yeah, I see her reading the papers.

12:06.146 --> 12:08.381
She's following his
R.I.C.O. pre-trial hearings.

12:11.585 --> 12:13.018
I'm glad you're wearing it.

12:15.422 --> 12:17.590
It's very sweet of you to give it to me.

12:18.792 --> 12:21.460
<i>I got to get back to class.</i>

12:21.528 --> 12:23.629
I'd really appreciate
it if you'd talk to her,

12:23.697 --> 12:26.899
- find out what's going on.
- Okay.

12:29.636 --> 12:33.005
- Now what?
- No idea.

12:33.039 --> 12:36.108
I can't think in these boots.

12:36.142 --> 12:37.576
- Come on, let me do it.
- No.

12:37.610 --> 12:41.780
- Let me at least run the search.
- No way!

12:41.814 --> 12:44.950
Nothing in AFIS or NCIC.

12:45.018 --> 12:46.385
Who the hell is she?

12:46.453 --> 12:51.089
You got to go to the seminar
and read the manual.

12:51.124 --> 12:54.392
- It's not your personal toy.
- And it's not an arcade game.

12:54.427 --> 12:55.627
Move. I want to run
the training session.

12:55.661 --> 12:57.061
Stop!

12:57.096 --> 12:58.229
<i>- Stop messing around.
- I'm not gonna break it.</i>

12:58.263 --> 12:59.630
<i>- Stop it!
- You're gonna break it.</i>

12:59.665 --> 13:02.800
Whoa, hey, hi!
Could you kids please share your toys?

13:02.834 --> 13:04.568
Well, he hogs the thing like he owns it.

13:04.602 --> 13:06.437
Yeah, because one swipe
from bear paws here

13:06.471 --> 13:08.272
will take out the whole system.

13:08.306 --> 13:10.608
So, no I.D.?
She's still a Jane Doe?

13:10.642 --> 13:12.443
We got to wait on dental records.

13:12.477 --> 13:14.979
Preliminary results are back
on the tissue samples from her lungs.

13:15.013 --> 13:17.815
Lungs?
Wasn't cause of death drowning?

13:17.849 --> 13:20.151
- Yes, but not from seawater.
- Sparkling water?

13:20.186 --> 13:22.354
No, she aspirated rainwater.

13:22.388 --> 13:24.156
We're looking for a crime scene
with a bucket full of rainwater?

13:24.190 --> 13:26.058
Well, we know the body
was tossed in the ocean

13:26.126 --> 13:27.260
somewhere near the harbor.

13:27.294 --> 13:29.328
Yeah, maybe she was killed
near the harbor, too.

13:29.363 --> 13:31.097
<i>Are there any tests you can run?</i>

13:31.131 --> 13:32.832
<i>I'll have Susie run
the water from the lungs</i>

13:32.867 --> 13:34.200
through the mass spectrometer.

13:34.234 --> 13:36.335
It is a long shot, though.

13:38.038 --> 13:41.473
- Hey, what are you doing for lunch?
- Nothing. Why?

13:44.310 --> 13:46.644
Come on, Maura.
You can do this. Come on.

13:46.679 --> 13:49.848
No, I don't like to be
tricked twice in one day.

13:49.882 --> 13:52.317
I said we were having
lunch. I didn't say where.

13:52.351 --> 13:55.119
Oh, it was wise of you not to
tell me what lunch was, either.

13:55.154 --> 13:57.188
What, you don't like
cold, greasy corn dogs?

13:57.222 --> 14:00.024
You know, this used to
be a methadone clinic,

14:00.058 --> 14:02.225
but thanks to Dr. Hope Martin,

14:02.293 --> 14:04.828
<i> it's the first M.E.N.D.
clinic in the U.S.</i>

14:04.862 --> 14:07.163
Look, I do not object to her
saving women and children,

14:07.197 --> 14:09.499
but I do object to her calling me a liar

14:09.533 --> 14:11.500
and then ignoring me
until she needed my kidney.

14:11.535 --> 14:14.136
You're a good person.

14:14.204 --> 14:19.174
Why do we always feel this tug
when we're related by blood?

14:19.209 --> 14:23.179
- What does the research say?
- Nothing that explains how I feel.

14:30.387 --> 14:31.487
Name?

14:31.522 --> 14:33.156
- Detective Rizzoli!
- Hi, Shandra.

14:33.190 --> 14:36.626
Girl, you are still as skinny
as the day you locked me up.

14:36.694 --> 14:38.761
- How are you? You look great.
- Thank you.

14:38.863 --> 14:41.464
This woman is the reason I quit
drugs and finished nursing school.

14:41.498 --> 14:43.667
- Look at you.
- Thank you.

14:43.701 --> 14:45.202
Sorry it's so crazy in here today.

14:45.236 --> 14:47.704
No, that's all right.
We're actually here to see Dr. Martin.

14:47.738 --> 14:49.172
Bye-bye.

14:49.206 --> 14:52.442
Maura.
Detective Rizzoli.

14:52.510 --> 14:55.578
- Is Cailin all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

14:55.613 --> 14:57.213
She's a little concerned
about you, though.

14:57.248 --> 14:59.649
About me?
Why?

15:02.520 --> 15:06.123
- Where did you get that necklace?
- Oh, I'm ... I'm sorry.

15:06.191 --> 15:08.893
I-I thought you knew
that Cailin gave it to me.

15:08.927 --> 15:10.694
Oh, of course.

15:10.729 --> 15:14.765
<i>Shandra, could you please
put Mrs. Reynolds in room two</i>

15:14.799 --> 15:16.066
<i>and weigh that Perez baby?
Thanks.</i>

15:16.100 --> 15:17.735
Let's go talk in my office.

15:20.272 --> 15:23.206
Teenagers can be so dramatic.

15:23.241 --> 15:27.043
Those "big, scary men ..."
they're my accountants.

15:27.077 --> 15:31.380
- Well, I'll talk to her.
- Your accountants come at 11:00 at night?

15:31.414 --> 15:35.050
Well, I am too busy during the day.

15:35.084 --> 15:38.520
- She's afraid for you, Hope.
- And that's silly.

15:38.555 --> 15:40.522
And although I'm very sorry
that she put you through this,

15:40.557 --> 15:42.691
I really am glad to see you, Maura.

15:45.462 --> 15:47.062
I don't want to pry into your life.

15:47.096 --> 15:50.732
I just feel a responsibility to Cailin.
I told her I would talk to you.

15:50.767 --> 15:53.135
And I so appreciate it, but, really,
it's just M.E.N.D. business.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.936
Is that why you told
Cailin to lock the door?

15:54.971 --> 15:58.807
<i>And why are you moving back to London?
Is someone threatening you, Hope?</i>

16:00.677 --> 16:03.246
Sorry, Doctor.
We're getting a little behind.

16:03.313 --> 16:06.953
I will be right there. I'm sorry,
but I have to get back to work.

16:08.685 --> 16:12.521
How can you go back to London
with all these people depending on you?

16:12.556 --> 16:15.624
Every clinic that I open
has to run without me eventually.

16:15.659 --> 16:17.827
<i>And I do have to think about Cailin.</i>

16:17.861 --> 16:21.865
She wants to move back to London.
Thank you.

16:28.926 --> 16:31.555
Too bad line that give her hives.

16:31.556 --> 16:33.257
Maybe she has bad lying a reason, Jane.

16:33.291 --> 16:35.225
What ... the truth gives her eczema?

16:35.260 --> 16:38.429
- You don't like her, do you?
- No, I don't like the way she treats you.

16:38.463 --> 16:40.765
Cailin's an adult. Have
a relationship with her.

16:40.799 --> 16:42.700
You know, you don't have
to have contact with Hope.

16:42.734 --> 16:46.037
And, by the way, what does
Constance say about all this?

16:46.071 --> 16:49.606
She raised me. She's my mother.
I don't talk about it with her.

16:51.808 --> 16:55.478
- Hey, Frost. What's up?
- Got something, although bear paws

16:55.579 --> 16:57.346
might take the rest of
his life pulling it up.

16:57.414 --> 16:59.348
<i>You know, some research indicates</i>

16:59.415 --> 17:02.918
that a wide hand with stubby fingers
correlates with high intelligence.

17:02.952 --> 17:07.256
- See that, smart ass?
- Okay. Got our victim.

17:07.290 --> 17:10.092
Brenda Thomas, 20.
She was a BCU student.

17:10.126 --> 17:12.461
And a Psi Beta Tau.

17:12.494 --> 17:16.619
Same type as in my day.
Betas were smart, foxy.

17:16.833 --> 17:19.969
- You didn't go to college, Korsak.
- I went to a lot of toga parties.

17:24.340 --> 17:27.443
I wouldn't use that.
Expired lipstick grows bacteria.

17:27.478 --> 17:30.413
- Is it pinkish red in a black tube?
- Yes.

17:30.481 --> 17:31.715
She's had that since I got promoted.

17:31.782 --> 17:34.984
<i>Ignore him, Jane.
Victim's parents live in Dedham.</i>

17:35.052 --> 17:36.452
We'll make the notification,
then hit the sorority house.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.421
All right, I'll meet you back at BPD.

17:39.757 --> 17:41.858
- What's wrong?
- I forgot to get my dry cleaning,

17:41.926 --> 17:43.893
so I'm gonna drop you
off and pick it up.

17:43.928 --> 17:45.161
Okay.

17:59.343 --> 18:02.511
You said this was about
my daughter, so get to it.

18:06.949 --> 18:10.552
- Call your boys off Maura.
- What the hell you talking about?

18:10.587 --> 18:12.988
The thugs you got following Maura.
Call them off, Paddy.

18:13.022 --> 18:15.190
Is she okay?
Is Maura all right?

18:15.224 --> 18:18.560
Yeah, she's fine.
Why are your guys following her?

18:18.594 --> 18:20.395
Are these the same guys
that you sicced on Hope?

18:20.429 --> 18:22.263
Did you get a look at 'em?

18:23.766 --> 18:25.200
They're not your guys, are they?

18:25.234 --> 18:28.336
I don't think you need me
to answer that one for you, Rizzoli.

18:28.370 --> 18:30.872
Why are the feds after Hope?
Why are they surveilling Maura?

18:30.906 --> 18:33.208
- I'm done here.
- No, wait a minute!

18:33.242 --> 18:35.810
Why are they surveilling Maura?

18:45.087 --> 18:47.823
Thanks, Gabriel.
I really appreciate it.

18:48.658 --> 18:51.326
- That was awkward.
- Thank you for calling Agent Dean.

18:51.361 --> 18:53.962
I know that was hard.
What did he say?

18:54.030 --> 18:55.564
He said he really
shouldn't be talking to me,

18:55.665 --> 18:56.598
but here's what he knows.

18:56.666 --> 18:59.000
The organized crime division of the FBI

18:59.035 --> 19:01.002
is investigating M.E.N.D. and Hope.

19:01.037 --> 19:03.572
- Oh, my god. For what?
- He said he didn't know.

19:03.606 --> 19:06.274
But think about it, Maura.
it's got to be connected to Paddy.

19:06.309 --> 19:08.509
And you should have seen Paddy's face.
He knows why.

19:12.948 --> 19:16.884
Okay. She started M.E.N.D. in 1993.
That's 20 years ago.

19:16.918 --> 19:20.220
Which means they were in
contact after I was born.

19:22.222 --> 19:24.023
Maybe even when he was a fugitive.

19:28.295 --> 19:32.231
- They're following you, too.
- The feds?

19:32.266 --> 19:35.101
- Yeah, I saw them today.
- Why?

19:35.135 --> 19:37.403
I don't have anything to do
with M.E.N.D. or with Paddy.

19:42.108 --> 19:44.109
- What do I do?
- Nothing.

19:44.144 --> 19:46.746
I mean, there's nothing you can do
once they're surveilling you.

19:46.780 --> 19:48.915
All right, I got to go talk
to the victim's roommates.

19:48.949 --> 19:53.320
Go. Go, it's okay.

19:56.123 --> 19:59.726
- You seeing anything?
- Just a bunch of girly stuff.

20:04.499 --> 20:07.735
I think I just found some study aids.

20:09.638 --> 20:12.306
"BCU gold dust."
Looks like cocaine.

20:13.575 --> 20:17.178
- Jane's stuck on memorial drive.
- We have to get DCU involved.

20:18.914 --> 20:21.249
What's the deal between
Jane and Martinez?

20:21.283 --> 20:23.084
It is a long story.

20:23.118 --> 20:27.121
Rachel?
Come in here, please, would you?

20:27.155 --> 20:29.657
Did Brenda snort a lot of cocaine?

20:29.691 --> 20:32.293
No way.
She was so against drugs.

20:32.360 --> 20:35.329
She didn't even drink.

20:35.363 --> 20:37.364
She told me that her
brother died from an O.D.

20:37.399 --> 20:38.632
Help your friend out, Rachel.

20:38.666 --> 20:43.436
- We need to know what Brenda was into.
- School.

20:43.504 --> 20:45.005
How about the rest of you?
You recognize this?

20:45.039 --> 20:48.676
I don't know why she had that,
but she was not using it.

20:48.710 --> 20:51.045
- Did she have a boyfriend?
- No.

20:51.113 --> 20:54.316
She studied so much,
she'd fall asleep in the library.

20:54.350 --> 20:57.720
That's why we weren't worried
when she didn't come home.

20:57.787 --> 20:59.288
What was she studying?

20:59.323 --> 21:01.491
Brenda wanted to be an
investigative journalist.

21:01.525 --> 21:03.025
Like Woodward and Bernstein?

21:03.093 --> 21:05.894
No, like Christiane Amanpour.

21:05.929 --> 21:07.897
She got an "A" on this
investigative report.

21:07.998 --> 21:10.100
Yeah, she got an "A" on everything.

21:10.134 --> 21:15.573
- Who is T.F.?
- Her adviser, Tyrell Feeney.

21:15.607 --> 21:18.075
Brenda called him "touchy Feeney."

21:19.044 --> 21:21.812
Maybe touchy Feeney did
more than just touch.

21:24.382 --> 21:27.384
Looks like Brenda didn't want
her sorority sisters in her computer.

21:27.418 --> 21:30.387
She password-protected everything
and stored it in the cloud.

21:30.488 --> 21:32.356
There's no way I'll get
in without a password.

21:32.390 --> 21:34.224
Did you try "password"?

21:34.325 --> 21:36.793
- "Password"?
- Yeah. It's the most common password.

21:36.828 --> 21:38.595
What do we know about Mr. Touchy Feeney?

21:39.431 --> 21:43.167
Well, he was a part-time
adjunct professor at BCU,

21:43.201 --> 21:46.570
wrote about crime for the Boston dispatch.

21:46.604 --> 21:48.705
Okay, this is interesting.

21:48.740 --> 21:51.934
- He owns a boat.
- Does he?

21:53.244 --> 21:56.346
I wonder if he took Brenda for a ride.

21:56.380 --> 21:58.915
<i>Nice boat.</i>

21:58.950 --> 22:00.650
<i>We found it when we were
doing a little digging</i>

22:00.685 --> 22:02.919
into a dead girl's relationships.

22:02.954 --> 22:05.422
Brenda and I didn't have a relationship.

22:05.456 --> 22:07.324
She was an exceptional
student. That's all.

22:07.358 --> 22:09.559
- How so?
- She was truly gifted.

22:09.627 --> 22:12.629
She could write, and she could
get anybody to talk to her.

22:12.663 --> 22:15.032
When she thought she had a story,
you couldn't shake her loose.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.300
What was she working on?

22:16.368 --> 22:18.135
I had all my students working
on investigative pieces

22:18.203 --> 22:20.471
for the Boston dispatch college contest.

22:20.506 --> 22:24.075
- What was she investigating?
- I don't know.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.878
- You were her adviser.
- I made an exception.

22:26.913 --> 22:30.682
Maybe I shouldn't have,
but, like any good journalist,

22:30.716 --> 22:32.283
Brenda was protecting her sources.

22:32.318 --> 22:35.454
Well, maybe she just didn't want
any contact with you, Tyrell.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.655
You are a hugger.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.224
That was me just being
friendly and encouraging.

22:39.258 --> 22:42.593
- You hug all your students?
- She was 21.

22:42.628 --> 22:47.465
Even if I did hug her, which I didn't,
it isn't a crime.

22:47.499 --> 22:51.102
- Not unless you killed her.
- I did not kill her.

22:51.136 --> 22:52.804
Where were you last night?

22:52.838 --> 22:56.407
Out with my wife.
She can verify that.

22:56.442 --> 23:01.346
Next time you guys would like
to talk to me, call my lawyer.

23:05.919 --> 23:08.854
Frankie.
Oh, come on, Frankie.

23:08.922 --> 23:12.492
- What?
- You look terrible.

23:12.526 --> 23:13.459
Thanks.

23:13.494 --> 23:16.963
- What can I do?
- Fix it.

23:16.997 --> 23:18.798
Whatever happened between
you and Martinez, undo it.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.967
Well, you know what, Frankie?
It's not that easy, all right?

23:21.001 --> 23:23.670
I'll just suck it up while Martinez
shuts me out of any real drug work.

23:23.704 --> 23:26.473
DCU's working my homicide, okay?
I'll get you on it.

23:26.507 --> 23:29.008
Oh, fun!
Maybe you'll let me answer your phones.

23:29.043 --> 23:30.777
- You know what, Frankie?
- Hey!

23:30.811 --> 23:35.014
Other Rizzoli.
Been looking for you. Come on.

23:35.049 --> 23:36.816
Wait, Frankie, come...

23:38.720 --> 23:40.721
You and Martinez should've
worked this out eight years ago.

23:40.822 --> 23:42.489
Vince, come on. This is
my business, all right?

23:42.524 --> 23:43.990
But we're all caught up
in the middle of it, Jane.

23:44.025 --> 23:45.926
Clean it up.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.995
Oh, good, Jane.
I've got something.

23:49.030 --> 23:51.664
I may be able to narrow down
the location of the crime scene.

23:51.699 --> 23:52.899
That's great news. How?

23:52.966 --> 23:56.235
Well, the water in Brenda's lungs
showed low levels of salinity

23:56.303 --> 23:59.571
plus CO2 as bicarbonate
anion, fish scales, and rust.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.940
- What kind of rust?
- Heavy-gauge tin.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.442
Saline, fish scales, and rusty tin.

24:04.477 --> 24:05.677
That all says one of the old warehouses

24:05.711 --> 24:07.078
- near the harbor to me.
- Yeah, me, too.

24:07.146 --> 24:09.781
- What's bicarbonated anion?
- Rainwater.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.450
Hey, Frost, can you check
the Seaport district?

24:11.484 --> 24:13.385
See how many abandoned
warehouses are down there?

24:13.420 --> 24:14.887
You don't know how to use that.

24:14.922 --> 24:16.689
Oh, yeah?
I read the whole manual.

24:25.665 --> 24:28.735
There are only seven processing
plants still standing.

24:28.769 --> 24:30.570
Let's go check 'em out.

24:36.670 --> 24:38.960
<i>This is number four. </i>

24:40.378 --> 24:42.177
Well, look at that.

24:42.278 --> 24:44.646
<i>Looks like we found
our bucket of rainwater.</i>

24:44.680 --> 24:46.748
<i>Water from the roof
is leaking right into it.</i>

24:46.782 --> 24:50.351
I'll compare the water in
here to the water from her lungs.

24:55.024 --> 24:57.091
That's blood, and that's hair.

24:57.125 --> 24:59.293
Get CSRU here,
have 'em process everything.

25:03.031 --> 25:07.368
- The water is a match.
- Okay, this is our crime scene.

25:13.642 --> 25:18.112
<i>Found a wireless mike.
It's greasy.</i>

25:18.147 --> 25:19.947
Looks like someone
crushed it with his heel.

25:19.982 --> 25:22.950
- Maybe she was wearing a microphone.
- That explains the adhesive we found.

25:22.985 --> 25:26.354
- She had a mike taped to her chest.
- These mikes are pretty cheap,

25:26.388 --> 25:28.523
but they give a
near-broadcast-quality recording.

25:28.557 --> 25:32.427
Near-broadcast quality. She wanted
to be like Christiane Amanpour.

25:32.461 --> 25:34.029
Maybe she was wired
for an ambush interview.

25:34.063 --> 25:35.731
Well, that'll get you killed.

25:35.798 --> 25:37.733
Yeah, especially when
you're writing about drugs.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.969
<i>Think about it. She didn't do drugs.</i>

25:40.003 --> 25:41.570
<i>She was writing an investigative piece.</i>

25:41.671 --> 25:44.474
- What about those bindles we found?
- She had 'em arranged like evidence.

25:44.508 --> 25:46.810
Maybe she was cataloging
them for the story?

25:46.844 --> 25:50.013
I've tried getting into her cloud.
We need her password.

25:50.048 --> 25:53.918
- I'm telling you, try "password."
- Try "BCU gold."

25:58.056 --> 26:00.758
We're in!

26:02.061 --> 26:04.729
Crap. Almost.

26:04.764 --> 26:07.098
The audio files are
individually password protected.

26:07.133 --> 26:10.068
- Try "password."
- If you say that again,

26:10.102 --> 26:12.303
I don't care how big
your bear paws are...

26:12.338 --> 26:14.605
Trying "BCU gold."

26:14.673 --> 26:17.575
No.

26:17.610 --> 26:21.579
Yes!
This one's opening.

26:25.283 --> 26:29.019
<i>Please!
Please!</i>

26:32.790 --> 26:34.057
<i>Don't!</i>

26:45.470 --> 26:47.737
Hey, Korsak, you ever
wish you went to college?

26:47.771 --> 26:50.640
Yeah, sometimes.
You?

26:50.674 --> 26:54.143
I saved my acceptance letter
to Boston Cambridge Uuniversity.

26:54.245 --> 26:55.979
- I don't know why.
- I do.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.614
It's damned impressive that you got in,

26:57.648 --> 27:00.584
and unbelievably selfless
that you chose not to go.

27:00.618 --> 27:05.490
I'm the daughter of a plumber.
My parents would still be paying it off.

27:05.591 --> 27:09.094
- What is it?
- There's something in here.

27:23.576 --> 27:25.577
Looks like you got another C.I. killed.

27:25.611 --> 27:27.312
What the hell are you talking about?

27:28.614 --> 27:30.682
<i>Brenda Thomas.
You recognize her?</i>

27:30.717 --> 27:32.117
<i>'Cause we pulled her
body out of the harbor.</i>

27:35.254 --> 27:36.655
You knew.

27:36.689 --> 27:39.691
Cavanaugh told me after they found
the cocaine in Brenda's room.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.626
We got brought in to investigate, yes.

27:41.661 --> 27:44.063
Well, you seem pretty calm
for someone who just lost a C.I.

27:44.097 --> 27:46.999
- She wasn't my C.I.
- No?

27:47.067 --> 27:50.236
Then why does she have your
card and your safety word?

27:50.271 --> 27:52.605
Because all your informants
are expendable, right?

27:52.640 --> 27:56.242
Just one more dead one.
One more dead one like Yolanda.

28:00.514 --> 28:04.151
Brenda asked for an interview
for a story about campus drugs.

28:04.185 --> 28:07.954
I talked to her because she told me
she could get me into a big operation.

28:07.989 --> 28:10.557
We've been trying to bust the guy
supplying to all the colleges in Boston.

28:10.658 --> 28:12.793
- With BCU gold?
- With a lot of cocaine, yes.

28:12.860 --> 28:15.162
So, you send this little college kid
to do an undercover drug buy?

28:15.196 --> 28:17.063
One time, Rizzoli!

28:18.066 --> 28:20.568
Do you know another way
to bust drug dealers?

28:23.538 --> 28:28.075
You use C.I.s.
Nobody likes it, but that's how it is.

28:28.143 --> 28:29.576
Well, why didn't you
tell me about all this?

28:29.611 --> 28:31.879
- I thought we were working together.
- Are we?

28:33.148 --> 28:35.649
<i>I want to know everything
you know about the supplier.</i>

28:35.683 --> 28:37.250
I got nothing.

28:37.352 --> 28:40.320
Well, you better get something
because this naive kid,

28:40.355 --> 28:43.223
who didn't want anybody
O.D.ing, like her brother,

28:43.258 --> 28:47.161
was drowned in a fish trough.
And that's on you, Martinez.

28:50.799 --> 28:54.601
We already picked up the guy
from the buy Brenda made for us.

28:54.636 --> 28:56.236
We're trying to get him
to make an introduction

28:56.270 --> 28:59.439
- to one of my undercovers.
- One of your under...

28:59.507 --> 29:01.223
Who, Frankie?

29:03.210 --> 29:07.513
Do me a favor.
Don't get my brother killed.

29:20.293 --> 29:21.993
What the hell happened
to the dirty robber?

29:22.028 --> 29:25.197
<i>New owners committed to
locally sourced organic food.</i>

29:25.231 --> 29:27.766
Yeah, well, I'm committed
to finding a burger and fries.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.369
Oh, no, come on.
Just try it.

29:30.436 --> 29:33.538
Come on.
There's a table right there.

29:35.475 --> 29:37.242
Anything?

29:37.276 --> 29:39.444
Frost can't get into the
rest of Brenda's files.

29:39.478 --> 29:41.212
<i>Thank you.</i>

29:43.149 --> 29:44.449
What about you?
You thinking about Hope?

29:46.785 --> 29:50.054
- Jane, are they here?
- Who?

29:50.089 --> 29:54.826
- The feds.
- Yes. You see that guy right there

29:54.860 --> 29:57.162
with the nose ring and
a bolt through his ear?

29:57.196 --> 29:59.429
That's their lead agent.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.799
Yeah. No, Maura.

30:01.867 --> 30:03.200
- No?
- No.

30:03.234 --> 30:05.035
Whew.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.840
What ... now, why are
you eating their plants?

30:08.874 --> 30:10.508
Fresh lavender. Try it.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.277
Smells like hand lotion.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.679
Well, they do have burgers.

30:15.714 --> 30:17.815
This sounds good, this
scrambled tofu patty.

30:17.850 --> 30:23.155
Yummy.
Get it with a side of mung bean fries.

30:25.359 --> 30:27.293
I can't stop thinking about Brenda.

30:28.696 --> 30:29.830
Me, neither.

30:31.666 --> 30:33.500
We didn't get her killed, Maura.
I did.

30:37.271 --> 30:39.105
You're not talking
about Brenda, are you?

30:42.176 --> 30:45.379
I guess that's why I've
been so mad at Martinez.

30:46.748 --> 30:50.385
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Um, yeah.

30:50.419 --> 30:52.153
We're gonna be right here
listening the whole time.

30:52.188 --> 30:54.756
You have any problems,
just say the word "cricket."

30:54.790 --> 30:56.558
<i>Yeah, we use the word cricket</i>

30:56.592 --> 30:58.493
so you won't slip up and
make a mistake, all right?

30:58.527 --> 31:01.329
- You only use it if you're in trouble.
- Okay.

31:01.364 --> 31:04.266
I just so desperately
wanted my own C.I.,

31:04.300 --> 31:09.171
and I leaned on this sweet,
screwed-up girl named Yolanda.

31:09.205 --> 31:10.506
You good to go?

31:12.909 --> 31:14.010
Let's do it.

31:19.383 --> 31:22.318
<i>She wasn't ready, but I
offered her up, anyway.</i>

31:23.253 --> 31:27.891
<i>- What are you doing?
- I told you I'd be here.</i>

31:27.925 --> 31:30.026
<i>- You have it with you? I have the money.
- Who's with you?</i>

31:30.060 --> 31:31.140
<i>Nobody's with me. I'm alone.</i>

31:31.141 --> 31:32.858
- She's in trouble.
- No. Wait for the safety word.

31:32.900 --> 31:34.215
<i>- No, don't!
- You wired?</i>

31:34.250 --> 31:36.266
<i>- Cricket! Cricket!
- We got to go!</i>

31:40.103 --> 31:42.604
<i>BPD!</i>

31:42.639 --> 31:44.473
<i>{ shouting in Spanish }</i>

31:49.279 --> 31:51.279
Oh, no, no. Come on.

31:51.314 --> 31:54.149
Come on, baby.
Yolanda, it's me. Yolanda?

32:01.556 --> 32:02.590
- What is it?
- Frost got into

32:02.624 --> 32:04.792
the other three files in Brenda's cloud.

32:11.691 --> 32:14.557
She taped three buys from
student drug dealers.

32:14.558 --> 32:17.826
Here's the last one.
Recorded the afternoon she died.

32:19.462 --> 32:22.197
<i> I really need something
to get me through finals.</i>

32:22.232 --> 32:24.233
<i>- I got you covered.
- You're a sweetheart.</i>

32:24.268 --> 32:26.769
<i>You could sell so much
BCU gold to my sisters</i>

32:26.803 --> 32:28.004
<i>if you'd just come to the house.</i>

32:28.038 --> 32:31.507
<i>I already told you, it's too risky.
I heard someone got arrested there.</i>

32:31.542 --> 32:35.345
<i>So? Introduce me to your connection.
I'll do it, cut you in for 40%.</i>

32:35.379 --> 32:39.082
<i>- I don't know.
- Come on, it'll be easy.</i>

32:39.150 --> 32:41.668
Well, she got that introduction,
and whoever's running

32:41.669 --> 32:44.187
this thing killed her, so
how do we find that student?

32:44.255 --> 32:45.589
I'll get on it first thing tomorrow.

32:50.161 --> 32:53.030
- What? What is it?
- Cailin.

32:53.064 --> 32:55.998
The feds just left Hope's house.

32:57.536 --> 33:00.170
I've got to show you something.

33:03.856 --> 33:06.691
<i>Just when I thought I'd seen everything.</i>

33:06.726 --> 33:09.228
I figured out how to do it when I was 9.

33:09.295 --> 33:13.432
<i>My parents didn't want me
watching TV, so they locked it up.</i>

33:14.901 --> 33:16.736
It's over here.

33:16.804 --> 33:18.905
Ooh, Maura, you've
been down here before.

33:18.973 --> 33:20.540
God, this is so unlike you.

33:20.574 --> 33:23.843
Maybe not. I am the spawn
of a mobster, after all.

33:23.878 --> 33:25.679
Well, is that why you come down here?

33:25.713 --> 33:29.049
When Paddy got arrested, I started
poking through all these files.

33:29.117 --> 33:32.820
- They go all the way back to his father.
- Your grandfather.

33:32.854 --> 33:35.056
Yes.

33:35.123 --> 33:37.158
Maura, come on. You're not like him.

33:37.192 --> 33:38.493
You're not like any of 'em.

33:38.527 --> 33:40.294
Well, something in these
files is gonna tell us

33:40.329 --> 33:43.230
why the feds were
looking at me and at Hope.

33:43.265 --> 33:47.301
1993 ... that's the year
Paddy became a fugitive.

33:47.369 --> 33:49.804
There's not a lot here
while he was on the run.

33:49.838 --> 33:52.774
I bet the FBI has a ton.

33:54.943 --> 33:59.113
Look. She came back once
a year on my birthday.

34:01.183 --> 34:02.216
Well, that's touching.

34:03.869 --> 34:05.303
Maura, she thought you were dead.

34:05.337 --> 34:08.540
- Okay, what if she wasn't coming for me?
- What do you mean?

34:08.574 --> 34:10.408
- I have a hunch.
- Oh, no, here we go.

34:10.443 --> 34:13.178
Maura, I told you never to hunch.
You're not made for hunching.

34:13.213 --> 34:16.081
Okay.
Cailin told me that Paddy

34:16.116 --> 34:18.484
gave this to Hope on her 18th birthday.

34:18.518 --> 34:20.219
That would have been 1976.

34:20.254 --> 34:23.058
That's not possible
because this scrimshaw

34:23.101 --> 34:25.623
commemorates something
that was built in 1993.

34:25.659 --> 34:27.025
- The year Paddy disappeared?
- Yes.

34:27.060 --> 34:29.061
And the year that Hope was
working as a relief doctor

34:29.094 --> 34:31.263
in a war-torn area, Sarajevo.

34:31.297 --> 34:35.333
So, I did some research, and I looked up
photos on the internet of this bridge.

34:35.368 --> 34:38.437
And it was near a secret tunnel
that was built during the siege

34:38.438 --> 34:41.507
of Sarajevo by people trying to
get humanitarian aid into the city.

34:41.541 --> 34:45.344
Humanitarian aid?
You think your mother helped build it?

34:45.378 --> 34:47.713
They named it the Tunnel of Hope.

34:47.748 --> 34:51.016
- Oh, my god.
- Paddy was a fugitive in 1993.

34:51.051 --> 34:52.819
He could have easily
traveled to the Balkans.

34:52.853 --> 34:55.955
So, you think Paddy and
hope met in Sarajevo?

34:55.989 --> 34:59.225
It's worse.
Hope started M.E.N.D.

34:59.260 --> 35:04.231
Thanks to a $2.5 million donation
from an anonymous donor...

35:04.298 --> 35:07.200
in 1993, Jane.

35:07.235 --> 35:10.804
Oh, my god.
That's why the feds are sniffing around.

35:10.871 --> 35:12.038
She took his dirty money.

35:21.047 --> 35:24.617
- Why am I here?
- Take a look at that.

35:31.626 --> 35:33.961
They're the financial
statements from M.E.N.D.

35:33.995 --> 35:36.864
And why are you looking at them?

35:36.898 --> 35:38.532
I don't think we're
the only ones looking.

35:38.566 --> 35:40.668
I don't know what you mean.

35:43.138 --> 35:45.340
Who gave you the money
to start M.E.N.D.?

35:45.407 --> 35:50.578
I don't know, but I will be
forever grateful to him or her.

35:50.613 --> 35:52.013
Because, thanks to that money,

35:52.048 --> 35:54.750
we've been able to save
thousands of women and children.

35:57.554 --> 35:58.821
I need to know.

35:58.855 --> 36:01.924
Was it Paddy?

36:04.794 --> 36:06.962
I have sick patients that I need to see.

36:06.997 --> 36:09.998
You won't be able to help them
if you're named as a co-conspirator.

36:13.002 --> 36:14.736
<i>Is that why the feds are
putting pressure on you?</i>

36:14.771 --> 36:16.405
Were you laundering money for him?

36:18.675 --> 36:20.208
- I can't ...
- Can't what?

36:20.243 --> 36:22.510
- I can't involve you.
- I am involved!

36:22.545 --> 36:26.080
- They're following me, too.
- What?

36:26.115 --> 36:28.415
<i>Oh, god, Maura. No.</i>

36:29.684 --> 36:32.853
I need to see him,
and I need to talk to him.

36:32.887 --> 36:35.121
I need to make this stop.

36:53.006 --> 36:56.209
- Maura.
- Don't talk to me. Talk to her.

37:09.056 --> 37:10.991
You told me she was dead.

37:12.527 --> 37:16.997
You told me that our baby...
was dead.

37:20.702 --> 37:26.073
- I had to ... to protect you.
- Why?

37:26.141 --> 37:28.442
My father would have killed you both.

37:30.145 --> 37:32.446
You have another chance
to protect them, Paddy.

37:35.016 --> 37:36.216
How's that?

37:41.489 --> 37:46.861
- You're going to plead guilty.
- You know I'd kill for either of you.

37:53.535 --> 37:56.170
But I will never plead guilty.

38:06.935 --> 38:10.637
Oh, mother... phooey.

38:11.071 --> 38:13.573
Did anything CSRU processed
from the crime scene

38:13.607 --> 38:16.943
- yield any prints or DNA?
- I'm sorry, nothing.

38:17.011 --> 38:18.845
Oh, wait.
There was one thing, though.

38:18.879 --> 38:20.347
The residue on the wireless mike

38:20.381 --> 38:23.149
is transmission fluid
with 41-40 steel particulates.

38:23.217 --> 38:25.451
That's a transmission
grinding itself up.

38:25.519 --> 38:28.821
Jane, I think these
are metal particulates,

38:28.889 --> 38:30.256
and I am almost certain
that what I stepped in

38:30.290 --> 38:31.857
was transmission fluid.

38:31.892 --> 38:33.375
From the parking lot of
the first crime scene?

38:33.476 --> 38:37.329
Yes. Susie, run both sets of metal
particulate through the SEM-EDX

38:37.363 --> 38:39.331
and analyze the fluids from the shoe

38:39.332 --> 38:41.299
and the microphone using the HPLC.

38:46.271 --> 38:47.771
<i>So, you're saying the transmission fluid</i>

38:47.806 --> 38:50.074
on the microphone we found
in the processing plant

38:50.108 --> 38:51.642
is the same as the stuff you stepped in

38:51.743 --> 38:53.878
- when we found her body?
- Yes.

38:53.912 --> 38:55.613
CSRU usually takes photos

38:55.647 --> 38:57.614
to establish the location
of the crime scene.

38:57.649 --> 38:59.817
Yeah, Frost, are there any
photos from the parking lot?

38:59.851 --> 39:01.886
Mm-hmm. Right here.

39:06.091 --> 39:07.524
So, it's one of these cars?

39:07.559 --> 39:09.493
Wait a minute ... we can't
know our killer left that fluid

39:09.527 --> 39:11.762
on the day we fished her
body out of the drink.

39:11.796 --> 39:14.264
Yeah, we can. I can even tell
you which car was leaking.

39:14.299 --> 39:17.935
Oh, that multi-touch interface
is talking to you, Tom Cruise?

39:17.970 --> 39:22.839
It's right here in the
vehicle maintenance records.

39:22.874 --> 39:24.041
For the state police.

39:25.476 --> 39:27.577
Our killer's a state trooper.

39:32.149 --> 39:35.618
- Martinez.
- Hey, Vinnie, what's up?

39:35.652 --> 39:37.153
We're on our way to
arrest Brenda's killer.

39:41.190 --> 39:43.458
Yeah, you can come with us,
if you want.

39:46.963 --> 39:52.133
Yeah. I'd like that.
Where to?

39:52.167 --> 39:54.169
We tracked the suspect on
the GPS in his unmarked.

39:54.236 --> 39:56.471
- It's a cop?
- Yeah, it's a state trooper.

39:56.505 --> 39:59.207
Looks like it was the college supplier
Brenda was telling you about.

39:59.241 --> 40:01.843
- Where is he?
- BCU campus ... probably there

40:01.877 --> 40:03.844
to collect his last
payments before he splits.

40:03.879 --> 40:05.279
- You got plates?
- Yeah.

40:05.313 --> 40:06.947
No, no, I don't want campus
police pulling him over.

40:06.981 --> 40:08.215
I'm not calling campus police.

40:08.316 --> 40:11.084
I'm calling someone to make
sure he doesn't get away.

40:26.134 --> 40:29.170
Hey!
Can you move that?

40:29.204 --> 40:31.973
Oh, I can't seem to get it to turn over.

40:33.242 --> 40:35.743
All right, I'll help you push it
out of the way. I'm in a hurry.

40:40.982 --> 40:44.185
<i>Frankie, get out of the way!
Thatcher, it's all over!</i>

40:47.022 --> 40:48.556
<i>No, you don't!
No, you don't!</i>

40:48.590 --> 40:50.224
<i>You stay together or I
will blow his head off!</i>

40:50.259 --> 40:51.726
Don't do it.

40:57.934 --> 41:00.335
Anything happens to my brother,
I won't need this gun to kill you.

41:00.369 --> 41:02.370
This is as much on you
as it is on me.

41:03.572 --> 41:05.706
Looks like you got nowhere to go, dude.

41:07.843 --> 41:10.511
All right, you drop the bike,
and you get in my car.

41:19.121 --> 41:20.721
Lift it up! Get it up!

41:22.457 --> 41:23.858
<i>You're under arrest, Thatcher.</i>

41:23.892 --> 41:26.728
- My brother's good, huh?
- Yeah.

41:26.762 --> 41:28.696
All right, just relax.

41:30.232 --> 41:31.065
Almost as good as you.

41:33.568 --> 41:37.204
- Don't even.
- What?

41:38.746 --> 41:41.596
