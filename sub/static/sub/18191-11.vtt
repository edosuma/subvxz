00:00.190 --> 00:01.920
Previously on "Chasing Life... "

00:01.944 --> 00:03.078
It's about your health.

00:03.113 --> 00:05.848
- What are you talking about?
- You have cancer.

00:05.882 --> 00:07.958
You're like the first person
I've ever dated that...

00:08.752 --> 00:10.488
I can actually see a future with.

00:10.513 --> 00:12.647
I've got three or four
months to live, if I'm lucky.

00:12.682 --> 00:14.516
I have a lot of stuff
to figure out right now.

00:14.550 --> 00:16.869
And I think it's probably
better if I do it on my own.

00:16.894 --> 00:18.661
Please have the surgery.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.620
I made this decision long before you.

00:20.645 --> 00:22.104
Honestly, I don't need you in my life,

00:22.129 --> 00:24.345
if you're on a mission
to make me rethink that.

00:24.826 --> 00:26.594
I was with Natalie.

00:26.619 --> 00:28.787
My sister, who you never told me about.

00:28.812 --> 00:31.226
-  April told me.
-  April knows, too?

00:31.267 --> 00:32.901
Do remember when we were
talking about what happened

00:32.935 --> 00:34.475
the other night and we
said that it was nothing?

00:34.500 --> 00:36.500
I'd be lying if I kept saying that.

00:36.587 --> 00:38.877
I could never forget about
what happened that night.

00:38.908 --> 00:41.543
But trust me, I am the wrong
horse for you to bet on.

00:41.568 --> 00:43.134
But that other guy...

00:43.159 --> 00:45.273
That's the one who actually
might win it for you.

00:45.298 --> 00:47.164
You got a lot of really great
people taking care of you.

00:47.189 --> 00:49.286
But right now, I need
to take care of myself.

00:49.311 --> 00:51.025
What are Leo's parents doing here?

00:51.050 --> 00:53.018
April, there's a voicemail on your phone.

00:53.043 --> 00:55.293
- It's from Leo.
- Oh, my God.

00:56.072 --> 00:58.107
April, it's Leo.

00:58.132 --> 01:00.312
I have something important to tell you.

01:01.087 --> 01:04.431
Wouldn't it be funny if the voicemail
ran out of time before I got to the point?

01:04.456 --> 01:06.244
Sorry, okay, um...

01:06.300 --> 01:10.370
So lately, you've got me
thinking a lot about death.

01:10.741 --> 01:13.525
Or maybe more about life, I'm not sure.

01:14.658 --> 01:17.125
Anyway, I've made a pretty big decision.

01:20.533 --> 01:21.572
What?

01:21.597 --> 01:22.627
What happened?

01:22.652 --> 01:24.262
Leo's getting the surgery.

01:24.318 --> 01:27.459
To remove the brain tumor.
I guess he's about to go in.

01:27.530 --> 01:28.811
I can't believe it.

01:28.836 --> 01:30.704
Wow. I mean... I don't really understand

01:30.729 --> 01:32.596
why he was so against
it in the first place.

01:32.621 --> 01:33.921
I mean, I guess there's like, a...

01:33.946 --> 01:37.227
A 50% chance that something could
go wrong with the surgery, so...

01:37.252 --> 01:39.253
Meaning what, exactly?

01:39.278 --> 01:41.126
Well, I mean, like...

01:41.151 --> 01:42.626
Brain damage, and...

01:42.683 --> 01:44.074
You know...

01:45.122 --> 01:46.222
Death.

01:46.375 --> 01:50.111
Oh. Well, at least he's trying.

01:50.136 --> 01:52.504
Clearly you've made an impression on him.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.865
Not that you should blame
yourself if anything goes wrong.

02:01.475 --> 02:03.475
Almond milk,

02:05.282 --> 02:07.283
unprocessed bran.

02:07.359 --> 02:09.860
I wish you'd let your mother-in-law

02:09.886 --> 02:12.238
buy her own groceries when she visits.

02:12.263 --> 02:14.478
That's not how hospitality works, mom.

02:14.503 --> 02:16.624
You're talking to me about hospitality?

02:16.649 --> 02:18.514
I'm letting the woman stay in our home.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.780
Even though she always

02:19.805 --> 02:22.164
starts a grandma competition over

02:22.189 --> 02:23.850
who's closer to the girls,

02:24.079 --> 02:27.150
when I obviously am.

02:27.646 --> 02:30.510
I really think Lynn's gonna
be on her best behavior.

02:30.535 --> 02:32.253
She won't want to add to any drama.

02:32.278 --> 02:34.415
She can't help it. Do you
remember last Christmas?

02:34.440 --> 02:36.880
She turned this whole house upside down.

02:36.905 --> 02:39.316
She really thought we had bedbugs.

02:39.341 --> 02:41.675
And we didn't. And you know
what else we didn't have?

02:41.700 --> 02:42.800
Christmas dinner.

02:42.825 --> 02:45.071
Let's just not add any
fuel to the fire, okay?

02:45.096 --> 02:48.370
Like, let's not mention Thomas'
affair while they're here.

02:48.427 --> 02:50.136
It would just break Artie's heart.

02:50.161 --> 02:51.995
You know he always put
Thomas on a pedestal.

02:52.020 --> 02:54.470
Thomas is the only one Artie never bullied.

02:54.495 --> 02:56.610
Yeah, he's always embarrassing me.

02:56.736 --> 02:59.271
Asking me if I have a
boyfriend in front of people.

02:59.296 --> 03:00.663
He should've come a few weeks ago,

03:00.688 --> 03:03.457
then you could've told him you
had a boyfriend and a girlfriend.

03:03.482 --> 03:06.610
Yeah, well, soon it will
just be a girlfriend.

03:06.635 --> 03:09.303
Oh. Did Greer's parents
have a change of heart

03:09.328 --> 03:10.361
about you two dating?

03:10.386 --> 03:12.480
No, but they're sending her off

03:12.505 --> 03:14.506
to this summer program in Oxford

03:14.531 --> 03:16.131
to keep us apart.

03:16.156 --> 03:17.186
I'm just...

03:17.211 --> 03:18.673
Hoping that they'll forget about it

03:18.698 --> 03:20.270
by the time she gets back.

03:22.075 --> 03:24.210
Party's over.

03:26.549 --> 03:28.770
- Hey!
- Hi, you made it!

03:29.348 --> 03:31.316
Hello, precious.

03:33.779 --> 03:35.344
Now, uh...

03:35.369 --> 03:39.307
I hope that you will give us
a little alone time with April.

03:39.328 --> 03:41.406
You've probably already visited her.

03:41.431 --> 03:42.698
Of course.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.658
There's plenty for me to
do around the house anyway.

03:45.683 --> 03:47.584
Like, fumigate it...

03:47.609 --> 03:48.906
Again.

03:49.548 --> 03:52.676
- Oh, darling!
- Hi!

03:52.951 --> 03:54.281
Look at her!

03:54.566 --> 03:56.861
Bet you're driving all the boys crazy.

03:56.879 --> 03:59.108
- Eh...
- And here's a little something

03:59.133 --> 04:01.506
to make your boyfriend jealous.

04:06.021 --> 04:08.382
- Wow.
- Yeah.

04:10.512 --> 04:12.722
Who wants bran?

04:37.019 --> 04:39.306
It's too hard to read this.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.621
I wanna be writing it.

04:41.980 --> 04:44.991
Even six days away from
work already feels like...

04:45.016 --> 04:46.850
I don't know, like...

04:46.875 --> 04:48.890
Lost a part of me.

04:48.972 --> 04:51.173
Every day I'm here I lose something else.

04:51.198 --> 04:53.902
Yeah, I know, but you get it all back.

04:54.036 --> 04:55.574
Except Dominic.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.690
Pretty sure he's gone for good.

04:59.168 --> 05:00.590
Maybe, Leo, too.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.753
Hey, you know what?

05:04.778 --> 05:06.513
I think that you should tell the nurses

05:06.538 --> 05:07.958
that you're in a lot of pain today.

05:07.983 --> 05:09.851
Get a morphine drip. Oh, yeah.

05:11.887 --> 05:13.688
Maybe not the day that my grandparents

05:13.722 --> 05:15.016
are coming to visit.

05:15.041 --> 05:17.265
I used to go to Seattle every summer.

05:17.290 --> 05:20.559
And then... I just keep
blowing off the trips for work.

05:20.584 --> 05:22.318
I'm a bad granddaughter.

05:22.343 --> 05:24.244
No, you're not. All right?

05:24.269 --> 05:25.794
You know what, if it
makes you feel any better,

05:25.819 --> 05:27.386
I am also losing things.

05:27.411 --> 05:28.478
Like my mind.

05:28.503 --> 05:29.503
I have officially blown through

05:29.528 --> 05:30.728
all of my savings

05:30.753 --> 05:32.520
since I quit my job, so now...

05:32.545 --> 05:33.917
I really can't afford to live alone,

05:33.942 --> 05:35.418
and that means I'm looking for

05:35.443 --> 05:36.577
a job, a roommate,

05:36.602 --> 05:37.602
and an apartment.

05:37.627 --> 05:38.693
Do you want me to look for you?

05:38.718 --> 05:40.724
Uh, yeah, no. There's no way

05:40.749 --> 05:41.883
I'm letting my cancer-stricken best friend

05:41.917 --> 05:42.984
do anything for me right now.

05:43.018 --> 05:44.852
No, really, please. I need...

05:44.887 --> 05:46.074
I need a project.

05:46.099 --> 05:47.683
Let's go online, come on.

05:47.708 --> 05:49.857
We can judge people.

05:51.060 --> 05:52.794
- Mom.
- Hey.

05:52.828 --> 05:53.995
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you were coming

05:54.029 --> 05:55.426
later with gran and grandpa?

05:55.451 --> 05:56.417
Well...

05:56.442 --> 05:58.342
I just wanted to talk
to you about something

05:58.367 --> 06:00.212
before you see them.

06:00.573 --> 06:02.556
Beth, I'm sorry, do you
mind giving us a minute?

06:02.581 --> 06:04.882
Yeah, sure. I'm just gonna...

06:04.907 --> 06:06.674
Head over to the vending machine and...

06:06.709 --> 06:08.382
Get my groceries for the week.

06:13.575 --> 06:14.728
Can we...

06:15.737 --> 06:17.228
talk about Natalie?

06:18.821 --> 06:20.655
Um...

06:21.824 --> 06:23.624
Yeah, sure.

06:24.177 --> 06:26.011
It's really convenient timing,

06:26.036 --> 06:27.758
bringing this up when I'm all weak...

06:27.783 --> 06:29.503
six days into chemo.

06:29.598 --> 06:32.533
What? You think I didn't plan that?

06:33.359 --> 06:35.128
How long did you know?

06:36.299 --> 06:38.854
I found out while I was
going over your dad's will.

06:38.907 --> 06:40.775
Is that when Uncle George found out too?

06:42.610 --> 06:45.345
No, George knew much longer.

06:45.614 --> 06:46.848
We had a big fight about it

06:46.882 --> 06:49.016
right before your dad's funeral.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.477
I'm the one who told him...

06:53.168 --> 06:54.556
not to come.

06:55.208 --> 06:57.276
And I feel terrible

06:57.301 --> 06:59.905
that I let you girls
think the worst about him.

06:59.995 --> 07:01.236
Oh, mom.

07:01.261 --> 07:03.296
It's okay, you were just...

07:03.321 --> 07:05.605
trying to protect us. I get it.

07:07.636 --> 07:08.770
Do granny and grandpa know?

07:08.804 --> 07:10.195
No.

07:11.157 --> 07:13.228
And I don't think it's
our place to tell them.

07:13.253 --> 07:15.021
I won't say anything.

07:15.320 --> 07:17.188
It's funny, I...

07:17.438 --> 07:18.846
Keep feeling like it's December

07:18.881 --> 07:20.548
because I only ever see them at Christmas.

07:20.582 --> 07:21.883
Then...

07:21.917 --> 07:25.405
I remember that I'm stuck in a
hospital on a random day in May.

07:26.219 --> 07:28.187
Merry Christmas to me.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.737
- Hey!
- Hey.

07:42.771 --> 07:45.239
Brought you some of my
old standby breakup food.

07:45.274 --> 07:46.541
Bacon-jalapeño chocolate.

07:46.575 --> 07:49.477
My buddy Isaiah in west
Cambridge makes it in his attic.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.891
Is there anything else in
here that I need to know about?

07:51.916 --> 07:53.347
Nah.

07:53.382 --> 07:55.416
I mean, if you ever need to like...

07:55.450 --> 07:57.985
Relax your muscles after an injury, or...

07:58.020 --> 08:00.021
Want to sleep on a plane
or something, it won't...

08:00.055 --> 08:01.403
Not help.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.312
You wanna go grab some lunch?

08:04.533 --> 08:06.103
I feel like I need to get out of the house.

08:06.128 --> 08:07.228
Uh, actually...

08:07.262 --> 08:09.130
Beth's waiting for me downstairs.

08:09.164 --> 08:10.407
We got plans.

08:10.645 --> 08:11.845
She didn't want to come up, huh?

08:12.067 --> 08:13.901
I'm sure you get it, you know?

08:13.936 --> 08:16.070
You just broke up with
her friend last night...

08:16.104 --> 08:17.805
In the hospital.

08:19.975 --> 08:21.976
God, I hate how that makes me sound.

08:22.010 --> 08:24.381
You know everyone's gonna
think that I'm like, evil,

08:24.406 --> 08:26.805
because this happened while
April's in the hospital.

08:27.364 --> 08:29.298
But I'm the one that got screwed over here.

08:29.323 --> 08:30.828
Look, even if they talk about it,

08:30.853 --> 08:32.854
they're gonna forget about it, okay?

08:32.888 --> 08:35.405
It might just take a little time.

08:36.225 --> 08:38.205
Well, four months is a little time.

08:38.933 --> 08:40.394
Oh, so you're going back to Europe?

08:43.532 --> 08:46.105
I was just calling to book
a flight when you walked in.

08:47.436 --> 08:48.502
Oh.

09:01.016 --> 09:02.149
Oh, my...

09:03.483 --> 09:04.816
I thought that...

09:05.196 --> 09:07.130
It turns out, they don't let you just...

09:07.155 --> 09:09.023
Rush into brain surgery

09:09.057 --> 09:11.175
because it's...

09:11.661 --> 09:13.763
Well, it's brain surgery.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.630
I've been doing tests all morning.

09:15.664 --> 09:16.797
Just had an MRI.

09:16.832 --> 09:18.900
My surgery's not for a few more days.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.635
Talk about blue brains, huh?

09:21.970 --> 09:25.606
I keep... thinking that I'm
never going to see you again.

09:25.641 --> 09:26.841
And then I see you...

09:26.875 --> 09:28.171
Again.

09:28.296 --> 09:30.605
When I got your message this
morning, I thought that...

09:32.547 --> 09:34.382
I'm just happy that you're here now.

09:34.650 --> 09:36.584
And that you're doing this.

09:36.618 --> 09:39.353
You love to get your way.

09:39.388 --> 09:40.488
How 'bout you?

09:40.522 --> 09:42.844
You seem less freaked out
than you were yesterday.

09:42.869 --> 09:44.803
Hmm, yeah, that's not saying much.

09:45.116 --> 09:47.261
Was your family worried when you got back?

09:47.296 --> 09:49.130
Did you tell "Dimples" what happened?

09:51.066 --> 09:53.505
I'm sorry, I know you don't
like when I call him that.

09:54.069 --> 09:55.605
No, it's not that. We...

09:56.271 --> 09:58.139
We broke up.

09:58.173 --> 09:59.805
Again.

10:01.009 --> 10:02.910
Or he broke up with me.

10:02.945 --> 10:04.045
Oh.

10:06.915 --> 10:07.949
Anyway.

10:08.797 --> 10:10.876
I'm getting kind of tired.

10:11.887 --> 10:13.323
Oh, okay.

10:13.789 --> 10:15.937
Well, I'll leave you alone.

10:16.222 --> 10:17.758
I'll uh...

10:17.793 --> 10:19.860
See you when I check in, cancer friend.

10:29.954 --> 10:31.788
Should we come back later?

10:31.813 --> 10:34.157
No, honey, we've only
been here five minutes.

10:34.182 --> 10:36.313
And she's slept through every one of them.

10:36.545 --> 10:38.728
Listen, I'm going to the vending machines.

10:38.753 --> 10:39.917
They have rolos.

10:39.942 --> 10:41.110
Wait, don't go.

10:41.135 --> 10:42.816
Oh, she's awake.

10:45.420 --> 10:48.188
I made you some chicken salad.

10:48.213 --> 10:50.047
Oh, I'm sorry. She's actually not allowed

10:50.072 --> 10:51.239
to have any outside food.

10:51.264 --> 10:52.766
We have her on a strict diet.

10:52.791 --> 10:54.586
Oh, can't she have a little chicken salad?

10:54.611 --> 10:55.711
It's low fat?

10:55.736 --> 10:57.921
Granny, they're paranoid about bacteria

10:57.946 --> 10:59.449
until my blood counts go up.

10:59.474 --> 11:02.467
Well, there's no bacteria
in my chicken salad.

11:02.492 --> 11:04.760
But, okay.

11:05.015 --> 11:08.550
And I knitted you a hat.

11:08.575 --> 11:09.675
Is that allowed?

11:09.700 --> 11:11.307
Yeah, totally.

11:11.332 --> 11:12.418
Not that it matters,

11:12.443 --> 11:14.517
you probably think it's ugly, but...

11:14.542 --> 11:16.826
No, I love it.

11:17.066 --> 11:18.900
It's... wow.

11:18.925 --> 11:20.798
I can't wait to see you in it.

11:20.823 --> 11:22.216
Yeah, here it comes.

11:23.825 --> 11:25.526
Oh boy.

11:25.551 --> 11:28.386
Uh, listen, now that you've
got your loser hat on,

11:28.411 --> 11:29.703
you up for a game of chess?

11:29.728 --> 11:31.835
I don't know, um...

11:31.860 --> 11:33.214
I might get dizzy.

11:33.239 --> 11:34.839
There are always excuses.

11:34.864 --> 11:36.765
Nobody plays chess anymore.

11:36.790 --> 11:39.559
- Now that you don't come to visit us.
- Okay, let's play.

11:39.584 --> 11:41.352
Well, here...

11:42.207 --> 11:43.975
I'll help you with that pillow.

11:45.603 --> 11:47.237
I got it. I got it.

11:48.927 --> 11:51.638
I'm gonna roast you and toast you.

11:51.663 --> 11:53.731
Okay now.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.580
And here we go.

11:55.605 --> 11:57.038
You can have white.

12:08.151 --> 12:09.785
Are you feeling sick?

12:09.820 --> 12:12.054
- Is it the chemo?
- No, it's granny's perfume,

12:12.089 --> 12:13.603
it's like all over you.

12:13.628 --> 12:14.795
You should smell the house.

12:14.820 --> 12:17.894
And now she's trying to get me
to wear it, like, on purpose.

12:17.919 --> 12:20.309
She says it'll drive all the boys crazy.

12:20.334 --> 12:21.534
Uh, boys?

12:21.559 --> 12:22.559
Yeah.

12:22.584 --> 12:25.489
I haven't gotten around
to telling them yet.

12:25.970 --> 12:27.679
It's just so awkward, like...

12:27.704 --> 12:29.000
If I tell them that I like girls,

12:29.025 --> 12:31.174
they're gonna picture
me having sex with them.

12:31.199 --> 12:34.134
You can always test the waters
by telling them I'm the gay one?

12:34.461 --> 12:37.130
I am about to have some really short hair.

12:37.414 --> 12:41.217
As a sometimes lesbian I find
that stereotype very offensive.

12:46.106 --> 12:47.566
So, um...

12:48.827 --> 12:50.828
My hair started falling out.

12:50.853 --> 12:51.920
I know that's like...

12:52.080 --> 12:54.723
The least of my problems right now, but...

12:55.365 --> 12:57.266
God, I'm so sorry.

12:57.301 --> 12:59.268
That must...

12:59.303 --> 13:00.624
No, I'm sorry, I'm just...

13:01.818 --> 13:04.548
- Having a moment.
- Don't apologize.

13:04.573 --> 13:07.704
I have meltdowns in
front of you all the time.

13:08.526 --> 13:11.461
But, you're the little sister.

13:11.730 --> 13:12.866
So?

13:27.864 --> 13:29.799
Hey Brenna, did you eat breakfast?

13:29.833 --> 13:32.435
Hey, why is all the Christmas stuff out?

13:32.469 --> 13:33.469
Okay, good,

13:33.503 --> 13:34.670
everyone's here.

13:34.705 --> 13:36.333
So, I had an idea.

13:36.750 --> 13:39.418
I stayed over with April last night,

13:39.443 --> 13:40.643
and...

13:40.677 --> 13:43.646
She told me that she
started to lose her hair.

13:44.099 --> 13:45.640
She did already?

13:45.665 --> 13:47.733
Oh, that means the chemo's working.

13:47.763 --> 13:48.988
She's gonna beat this.

13:49.013 --> 13:50.195
I know, yeah,

13:50.220 --> 13:52.609
but she seemed really sad about it.

13:52.634 --> 13:56.704
So I was trying to think of ways
that we could cheer her up, and...

13:56.970 --> 13:58.380
I thought that maybe she'd like it

13:58.428 --> 14:00.225
if we decorated her room with all of this.

14:00.250 --> 14:02.151
What a great idea!

14:02.176 --> 14:03.843
She would love that.

14:03.868 --> 14:05.869
April was always obsessed with Christmas

14:05.894 --> 14:07.861
I remember when she was nine,

14:07.886 --> 14:10.554
she dressed up Brenna as...

14:10.579 --> 14:12.162
A reindeer!

14:12.209 --> 14:15.845
- I remember.
- Actually, it was the baby Jesus.

14:15.879 --> 14:18.620
Oh, you said she was nine?

14:18.645 --> 14:19.645
I thought you said eight.

14:19.670 --> 14:21.284
That was the reindeer year.

14:21.309 --> 14:24.829
Uh, I don't think Brenna
was even born then...

14:24.888 --> 14:26.522
but I could be wrong.

14:26.556 --> 14:28.445
Yeah, I think you are.

14:28.470 --> 14:31.484
I can't find that other
big bag of Christmas stuff?

14:31.509 --> 14:32.897
You know, the red one?

14:32.922 --> 14:34.343
Oh, well, remember...

14:34.368 --> 14:36.611
We had to get rid of that bag last year.

14:37.697 --> 14:41.199
Bed bugs lay their eggs
in soft, dark places.

14:41.279 --> 14:42.630
Hypothetically.

14:43.412 --> 14:46.080
- Good morning, hey ma.
- There he is!

14:46.105 --> 14:48.279
Hello. Hey dad.

14:48.345 --> 14:50.179
I'm surprised you can see him.

14:50.213 --> 14:52.148
He's so pale, he's almost transparent.

14:52.182 --> 14:54.737
Uh... it's good to see you too, dad.

14:54.762 --> 14:56.830
I'm just saying you don't get out much.

14:56.855 --> 14:58.022
Not that you ever did.

14:58.047 --> 14:59.748
Oh, you know, I'm uh...

14:59.828 --> 15:00.855
I'm very busy.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.343
I'm a doctor, too.

15:02.368 --> 15:05.730
I made a social life for
myself, a couple of kids...

15:05.755 --> 15:07.335
You just gotta meet the right girl.

15:07.364 --> 15:11.067
Well, and then the right
girl has to like me back.

15:11.101 --> 15:13.235
Have you tried looking online, dear?

15:13.270 --> 15:16.138
My friend, Valerie, her son, who is a...

15:16.173 --> 15:18.174
Oh, I don't know how you call it now,

15:18.208 --> 15:20.176
uh, polyamorous?

15:20.210 --> 15:23.317
He found a lovely couple online,

15:23.342 --> 15:25.910
and they're all, apparently, very happy.

15:25.949 --> 15:28.785
Well, great. Well, thanks,
that's very encouraging, mom.

15:28.852 --> 15:30.019
Oh!

15:30.053 --> 15:31.146
Okay.

15:31.171 --> 15:33.698
- Ah.
- Be careful.

15:33.723 --> 15:36.759
You don't want to add infertility
to your other problems.

15:42.284 --> 15:45.479
Sorry, we don't have Christmas
decorations this time of year.

15:45.502 --> 15:46.569
How is that possible?

15:46.603 --> 15:49.438
Your store is called "the
Christmas tree store."

15:49.473 --> 15:52.174
Yeah, they just thought it would
be a cute name for the store.

15:52.209 --> 15:55.211
So, you hardly ever sell
Christmas decorations

15:55.245 --> 15:57.546
and you never sell Christmas trees,

15:57.581 --> 15:59.415
even at Christmas.

15:59.449 --> 16:01.050
Have you ever been sued?

16:01.084 --> 16:02.218
Oh, come on.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.219
Let's go find Artie

16:03.253 --> 16:05.354
before something bad happens to him.

16:05.388 --> 16:07.323
I cannot believe that we sent him to get

16:07.357 --> 16:08.924
a plastic tree

16:08.959 --> 16:11.026
from a complete stranger on eBay.

16:11.061 --> 16:12.294
We should've sent you.

16:12.329 --> 16:15.064
No, we're not giving up on this, okay?

16:15.098 --> 16:16.165
How about we just...

16:16.199 --> 16:18.167
get a bunch of different
holiday decorations.

16:18.201 --> 16:20.002
That will at least make April laugh.

16:20.036 --> 16:22.715
Yeah, we just got our
fourth of July stuff in.

16:23.740 --> 16:24.773
Eh?

16:24.808 --> 16:26.075
Sorry, independence is

16:26.109 --> 16:27.843
kind of a sensitive subject

16:27.878 --> 16:29.912
for the person that we're
throwing the party for.

16:29.946 --> 16:32.615
Why? Did she used to
be in jail or something?

16:32.649 --> 16:33.616
No, it's...

16:33.650 --> 16:35.228
Long story.

16:35.253 --> 16:37.254
Well, my shift's another seven hours,

16:37.654 --> 16:39.121
if you feel like telling it.

16:39.890 --> 16:42.825
We can finish the shopping
if you want to stay and talk.

16:42.859 --> 16:44.793
I don't think she does.

16:44.828 --> 16:46.395
Well, how do you know?

16:46.429 --> 16:48.297
Maybe she wants to keep her options open?

16:50.459 --> 16:52.556
Oh, Brenna!

16:52.669 --> 16:54.670
Why don't we buy some of these?

16:54.704 --> 16:56.639
I don't know what holiday they're for,

16:56.673 --> 16:59.508
but they're just so colorful.

17:04.347 --> 17:06.337
Last day of chemo.

17:07.050 --> 17:09.396
I'd cheer if I had any energy.

17:10.420 --> 17:13.055
Well, I hate to add insult to injury,

17:13.089 --> 17:14.828
or illness as it were,

17:14.853 --> 17:16.157
but your numbers are getting a little low.

17:16.193 --> 17:18.260
Which is normal after a round of chemo.

17:18.295 --> 17:20.336
But if they get any lower,

17:20.896 --> 17:22.932
all of your visitors are
gonna have to wear these.

17:22.965 --> 17:25.034
Oh, that's really going
to bring out my eyes.

17:25.068 --> 17:26.902
Don't be jealous, April.

17:26.936 --> 17:28.871
You'll have to wear one whenever
you have to leave the room.

17:28.905 --> 17:31.073
Also, we're going to keep you
hooked up to your IV for the next...

17:31.107 --> 17:32.741
24 to 48 hours.

17:32.776 --> 17:34.109
Just to make sure you're
getting enough fluids.

17:34.144 --> 17:36.779
I know, it's annoying, but...

17:36.813 --> 17:38.455
It's for your own protection.

17:38.882 --> 17:41.112
Hair appointment for April Carver.

17:41.618 --> 17:43.953
Dr. Hamburg said it might
be less traumatic to just...

17:43.987 --> 17:45.754
take it all off at once.

17:45.789 --> 17:47.456
I'm gonna give you some space.

17:47.490 --> 17:49.288
But if you need me, I'm here.

17:51.728 --> 17:53.491
You want the eyebrows off too?

17:53.516 --> 17:55.397
What?! No.

17:56.128 --> 17:58.663
Hey, uh... Could we just have a minute?

17:58.688 --> 18:01.090
You know, before you
"GI Jane" my friend here?

18:01.538 --> 18:03.119
Thanks.

18:04.274 --> 18:06.208
What if I just did this for you?

18:06.243 --> 18:07.830
Do you even know how to cut hair?

18:07.855 --> 18:09.646
Does it even matter?

18:12.315 --> 18:14.016
Fine, whatever.

18:14.050 --> 18:16.218
Just do it however you want.

18:16.253 --> 18:17.319
Okay.

18:19.155 --> 18:21.888
However I want, you say?

18:30.948 --> 18:32.456
So, do you like it?

18:32.481 --> 18:34.592
You know I thought it'd
be more fun if we just,

18:34.617 --> 18:36.451
you know, take baby steps.

18:36.476 --> 18:38.310
And this way we can try a few more looks

18:38.335 --> 18:39.536
before we go all out.

18:39.561 --> 18:41.362
- I want to see it again.
- Ah.

18:42.660 --> 18:44.877
Knock knock!

18:44.902 --> 18:46.672
Did I just barge in on a private moment?

18:46.697 --> 18:48.398
That is the thing about
working in a hospital,

18:48.432 --> 18:49.632
it's like, never a good time.

18:49.667 --> 18:51.994
I'm just gonna leave
these here and go, okay?

18:52.040 --> 18:54.080
Here we go, okay.

18:55.163 --> 18:56.411
Oh...

18:56.803 --> 18:59.004
Did I hurt you? Are you hurt?

18:59.476 --> 19:01.110
Okay, I am gonna go before I kill you.

19:01.145 --> 19:02.245
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay.

19:02.279 --> 19:03.413
I'm fine.

19:03.447 --> 19:05.513
I'm so sorry, I'm just...

19:05.751 --> 19:08.071
New. Trying to figure out the rules.

19:08.385 --> 19:11.631
But, I've already started dating
one of the residents, Dr. Weaver.

19:11.656 --> 19:13.720
- Ooh, good choice.
- Oh, yeah.

19:13.745 --> 19:15.682
I know right?

19:15.707 --> 19:17.170
And it's kind of awkward timing though,

19:17.261 --> 19:19.549
because my roommate's
moving in with her fiance

19:19.574 --> 19:22.808
and now I have this huge two-bedroom
in bay village all to myself.

19:23.067 --> 19:25.168
And if we had started dating
a couple months ago, like...

19:25.202 --> 19:28.056
Maybe he'd be ready to
move in by now, but...

19:28.332 --> 19:29.465
Anyway.

19:29.490 --> 19:31.357
I guess I just need to find a roommate.

19:39.308 --> 19:41.276
Oh, wow.

19:41.301 --> 19:43.635
I'm getting run down from all this hosting.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.222
Could be my mother's perfume.

19:45.247 --> 19:47.611
She's not exactly known for her subtlety.

19:47.993 --> 19:50.679
I tell you, she and my dad
were really made for each other.

19:50.761 --> 19:53.192
Sorry it's been so awkward, all this...

19:53.217 --> 19:54.575
Questions about your love life.

19:54.665 --> 19:56.048
I'm used to it.

19:56.073 --> 19:59.116
It'd be nice just to be able
to give them a real answer.

19:59.303 --> 20:01.637
Of course, that would mean
I'd need to have one myself.

20:06.297 --> 20:09.167
It's just... it's not that simple.

20:09.701 --> 20:11.869
You know I feel what you do.

20:12.098 --> 20:13.609
Okay, that's good.

20:14.251 --> 20:15.251
So?

20:15.285 --> 20:16.674
So...

20:20.704 --> 20:23.039
Can we wait to have this discussion

20:23.064 --> 20:25.544
after the guests all
leave and things calm down.

20:25.569 --> 20:27.263
I just, I can't go there right now.

20:27.297 --> 20:28.965
Sure, sure, yeah.

20:30.367 --> 20:32.865
We should get out from
under this thing though, huh?

20:35.272 --> 20:36.852
Yeah, Brenna put that up.

20:36.877 --> 20:38.359
That's just a joke.

20:38.443 --> 20:40.811
She doesn't know anything.

20:42.880 --> 20:43.980
Oh...

20:44.014 --> 20:45.882
I'm really starting to
be worried about this.

20:45.916 --> 20:48.918
No, no. George, I'm not avoiding
having the conversation...

20:48.952 --> 20:50.553
No, no, no, I'm worried,

20:50.587 --> 20:51.821
because there's a cold going around.

20:51.855 --> 20:53.251
Well, okay, I'll...

20:53.276 --> 20:55.395
Pick up some cold medicine
on the way to the hospital.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.687
Sara, no.

20:56.712 --> 20:58.546
I'm saying that if you're getting sick,

20:58.662 --> 21:00.790
you can't visit April.

21:00.815 --> 21:02.015
At all.

21:08.605 --> 21:10.028
Congratulations.

21:10.441 --> 21:12.272
Your first round of chemo is over.

21:12.543 --> 21:14.343
In a few weeks we'll
do a bone marrow biopsy

21:14.378 --> 21:16.145
just to make sure this one worked.

21:16.180 --> 21:17.573
And if it did...

21:17.884 --> 21:19.651
We'll wait for your counts to recover

21:19.676 --> 21:21.710
before we start your
next round of treatment.

21:21.735 --> 21:24.163
I'm so sorry that your mom is sick.

21:24.778 --> 21:27.107
I know she really wanted
to be here for you, today.

21:27.148 --> 21:29.082
How long until she can come back?

21:29.359 --> 21:31.215
Probably a week, just to be safe.

21:32.948 --> 21:34.715
Come on, come on.

21:34.740 --> 21:35.806
Well...

21:36.133 --> 21:38.265
That's a sexy haircut.

21:39.036 --> 21:40.970
Yeah, I feel really sexy right now.

21:41.004 --> 21:43.485
Gran and grandpa, this is Dr. Hamburg.

21:43.510 --> 21:44.871
Hi, it's so nice to meet you.

21:44.908 --> 21:45.975
Oh, Dr. Hamburg!

21:46.009 --> 21:47.765
Yes, how do you do, Doctor?

21:48.257 --> 21:49.950
Let me know if you need anything else.

21:52.082 --> 21:54.750
How you feel, Ape? Huh? Like a fighter?

21:54.818 --> 21:56.519
'Cause that's what you are.

21:56.553 --> 21:58.554
You're gonna fight this
thing till you beat it.

21:58.589 --> 22:00.523
Right? Before you know it,

22:00.557 --> 22:02.725
you'll forget that this ever happened.

22:02.759 --> 22:05.628
I rarely think about my eczema anymore.

22:05.662 --> 22:07.597
Well, you sure talk a lot about it.

22:07.910 --> 22:09.298
Oh.

22:09.333 --> 22:10.910
Ah...

22:10.935 --> 22:12.674
We bored her to sleep.

22:12.964 --> 22:15.098
You  bored her to sleep.

22:15.123 --> 22:16.410
All right.

22:17.383 --> 22:18.617
We'll be back tomorrow.

22:28.397 --> 22:29.397
Hey!

22:29.558 --> 22:30.965
Nice hair.

22:30.990 --> 22:32.825
Is that... that's not a wig, is it?

22:32.850 --> 22:34.205
No, I, um...

22:34.537 --> 22:36.699
Thought I would just try
and do this in stages.

22:39.051 --> 22:40.621
Anyway, I just wanted to...

22:40.646 --> 22:42.086
Welcome you to the neighborhood.

22:42.120 --> 22:43.120
Oh, thanks.

22:43.155 --> 22:44.842
Yeah, I was gonna...

22:44.867 --> 22:47.729
I was gonna stop by your room
when I checked in, but um...

22:48.156 --> 22:50.223
I didn't know if you'd want me to do that.

22:50.248 --> 22:52.182
Why wouldn't I?

22:52.207 --> 22:54.242
I don't know...

22:54.342 --> 22:58.212
Just after everything that
happened with your dude.

22:58.355 --> 23:00.323
I guess I felt like I had
something to do with it.

23:00.348 --> 23:01.415
Yeah, but...

23:01.740 --> 23:03.206
You weren't the only reason.

23:03.231 --> 23:04.423
We weren't really...

23:04.448 --> 23:06.582
Connecting, and a lot of that was

23:06.607 --> 23:08.021
my fault.

23:08.192 --> 23:09.580
I kept a lot of stuff from him.

23:09.615 --> 23:12.416
Yeah. It's hard to connect to people

23:12.451 --> 23:14.505
who aren't going through this too.

23:14.982 --> 23:16.611
How are you?

23:17.053 --> 23:18.787
Big day tomorrow, huh?

23:18.812 --> 23:20.747
Oh yeah, what is it? Uh... flag day?

23:22.256 --> 23:23.756
That's how you deal with this?

23:23.781 --> 23:25.782
Just pretend it isn't happening?

23:25.807 --> 23:27.941
Oh, no, they make sure
I know it's happening.

23:27.966 --> 23:30.339
These are all the forms I have to fill out

23:30.402 --> 23:31.855
before they put me under.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.335
Do not resuscitate,

23:33.438 --> 23:35.035
physician's orders

23:35.060 --> 23:36.995
for life sustaining treatment,

23:37.020 --> 23:38.861
who gets to make decisions for me

23:38.910 --> 23:40.244
if I become a vegetable,

23:40.278 --> 23:41.757
my will.

23:42.147 --> 23:43.405
Are you scared?

23:44.049 --> 23:45.116
Of what?

23:45.150 --> 23:46.405
Come on.

23:46.430 --> 23:47.631
Dying.

23:52.124 --> 23:53.305
Sure.

23:54.277 --> 23:56.411
I never used to be afraid of it.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.505
In the abstract, but...

24:00.799 --> 24:04.205
Now that I know it could actually happen.

24:05.637 --> 24:06.852
Tomorrow.

24:08.473 --> 24:09.505
Yeah.

24:10.709 --> 24:11.776
That's...

24:12.505 --> 24:14.512
It's not to get all dark, but...

24:14.546 --> 24:15.713
No, no, get dark.

24:15.747 --> 24:17.381
I like dark.

24:18.417 --> 24:20.418
Well, you were kind of like

24:20.452 --> 24:22.738
the Robin Hood for cancer patients.

24:22.763 --> 24:25.074
Using your dad's money to help them

24:25.099 --> 24:27.005
live out their last wishes.

24:27.763 --> 24:31.099
You ever think about what
might be on your bucket list?

24:31.563 --> 24:34.065
Eww, you said "bucket list."

24:34.099 --> 24:35.505
Okay, fine.

24:35.745 --> 24:37.849
Keep making fun of me and die with regrets.

24:37.874 --> 24:38.938
See if I care.

24:38.963 --> 24:40.097
Okay,  that  was dark.

24:40.607 --> 24:41.806
Sorry.

24:42.532 --> 24:43.765
No, you're right.

24:46.788 --> 24:48.079
Yeah, I'll think about it.

25:47.777 --> 25:49.110
I like the blonde on you.

25:49.135 --> 25:50.702
Thanks.

25:50.727 --> 25:52.614
Since I'm spending all
my time with this pole,

25:52.639 --> 25:54.812
I figured, go stripper chic.

26:00.185 --> 26:02.887
I really thought I would feel stronger

26:02.921 --> 26:04.484
after the chemo stopped.

26:04.825 --> 26:07.793
Yeah, well, you know,
can't predict these things.

26:07.818 --> 26:09.785
You feel like crap, some days.

26:09.995 --> 26:11.796
Grandpa would say that that's

26:11.830 --> 26:13.063
"letting the cancer win."

26:13.098 --> 26:15.026
Eh, screw grandpa.

26:16.001 --> 26:17.701
I mean...

26:17.736 --> 26:19.970
I love him, he's my dad. But, uh...

26:20.783 --> 26:22.302
I know how he can be.

26:22.327 --> 26:24.050
He kind of made me feel like a failure

26:24.075 --> 26:27.386
when I didn't like, spring
out of bed this morning.

26:27.546 --> 26:29.120
Well, he's the last thing
you need to worry about.

26:29.145 --> 26:30.881
I feel bad, you know,
complaining about them

26:30.906 --> 26:32.327
when I only see them once a year.

26:32.352 --> 26:34.019
April, come on, that's okay.

26:34.054 --> 26:35.227
You're an adult now.

26:35.252 --> 26:38.210
It's okay to let some
relationships be more superficial.

26:45.696 --> 26:47.530
Sorry you're sick, mom.

26:47.555 --> 26:49.656
If it makes you feel
any better, I'm sicker.

26:49.681 --> 26:51.349
That doesn't make me feel any better.

26:51.374 --> 26:53.608
But I'm glad to get to
see your little face.

26:53.633 --> 26:55.334
And your hair!

26:55.359 --> 26:57.759
Very Marilyn! How'd you do...

26:57.784 --> 27:00.586
Hi, honey! How're you feeling?

27:00.780 --> 27:02.427
Um, yeah, I'm okay.

27:02.452 --> 27:06.071
Oh, that doesn't sound like
my little samurai warrior?

27:06.297 --> 27:08.064
Where's that fighting spirit?

27:08.089 --> 27:09.497
Dad, why don't you just let April

27:09.556 --> 27:10.723
feel however she's feeling.

27:10.757 --> 27:13.058
Spoken like a man who's
never been in the army.

27:13.083 --> 27:14.573
Well, enough about me.

27:14.598 --> 27:16.365
What's going on with
you guys? Any new gossip?

27:16.390 --> 27:18.769
We think Brenna has a boyfriend.

27:18.794 --> 27:21.320
Oh, yeah... you guys,
seriously, please stop.

27:21.345 --> 27:23.279
Look at her, she's blushing!

27:23.304 --> 27:25.106
All right, let's leave Brenna alone.

27:25.131 --> 27:26.865
What? Leave her alone?

27:26.890 --> 27:30.035
Says the woman who gets
to see you girls 52 weeks

27:30.060 --> 27:31.160
out of the year.

27:31.185 --> 27:33.197
And Artie and I only get one.

27:33.222 --> 27:35.410
Granny, it's okay, she didn't mean that.

27:35.448 --> 27:37.814
I guess that's what we
get for trying to catch up

27:37.839 --> 27:39.265
with our own grandkids.

27:39.290 --> 27:41.496
I don't have a boyfriend!

27:42.096 --> 27:44.030
I was dating someone

27:44.283 --> 27:45.517
and we broke up.

27:45.542 --> 27:47.776
But it was a girl because...

27:48.483 --> 27:50.584
I'm bi, okay?

27:52.608 --> 27:54.375
Bisexual.

27:54.400 --> 27:55.571
We know what it means.

27:55.596 --> 27:57.637
I can't believe this.

27:57.662 --> 27:59.830
You call yourself a liberal.

27:59.855 --> 28:01.923
- Okay, can you all just...
- I don't care that she's gay.

28:01.948 --> 28:03.925
- Uh, bi.
- I care that nobody

28:03.925 --> 28:05.352
told me until now.

28:05.377 --> 28:07.645
I am the last to know anything.

28:07.670 --> 28:10.074
For all I know, you could be married

28:10.116 --> 28:11.717
with three children, right now,

28:11.751 --> 28:12.951
and not telling your mother.

28:12.986 --> 28:14.517
Maybe he's bi.

28:14.542 --> 28:16.476
Oh, my God.

28:16.501 --> 28:19.236
You know what? Maybe I did meet somebody.

28:19.261 --> 28:20.465
But why would I tell you?

28:20.490 --> 28:22.424
So you two could pick my life apart?

28:22.449 --> 28:24.450
Oh, don't be so sensitive!

28:24.475 --> 28:26.476
It's just that you lead a...

28:26.501 --> 28:29.136
- Less normal life than...
- Than who?

28:29.197 --> 28:31.223
Than Thomas?

28:31.248 --> 28:32.711
Stop holding Thomas up as a model

28:32.736 --> 28:34.399
for what a good son is supposed to be,

28:34.424 --> 28:36.395
because, let me tell you
something, he had plenty of secrets

28:36.443 --> 28:37.509
that he never told you.

28:37.544 --> 28:38.775
Talk about secrets?

28:38.800 --> 28:40.767
Do you know about the affair that he had?

28:40.792 --> 28:42.318
Do you know about the fact that he's got

28:42.343 --> 28:44.477
a child who's 22 years old now?

28:47.874 --> 28:49.875
I guess you all

28:49.900 --> 28:51.457
know about Natalie.

28:51.524 --> 28:52.524
What?

28:52.559 --> 28:54.092
Thomas told us.

28:54.504 --> 28:56.438
A year before he died.

28:56.606 --> 28:59.304
- And you never told me?
- Mom, please, just...

28:59.329 --> 29:01.129
He was my son, it was his right to...

29:01.154 --> 29:02.621
And I was his wife!

29:02.646 --> 29:04.647
Stop! Everybody just stop!

29:05.038 --> 29:07.272
If there's one thing that isn't
gonna make me feel any better,

29:07.307 --> 29:08.616
it's this.

29:08.791 --> 29:09.958
So thanks for...

29:09.983 --> 29:12.685
trying to do the happy
family thing for me, but...

29:12.979 --> 29:15.582
from now on, just don't bother.

29:15.786 --> 29:18.050
If you have to come visit me,
you can come one at a time.

29:18.084 --> 29:20.349
And if you can't do that, then just...

29:20.374 --> 29:21.771
Leave me alone.

29:29.267 --> 29:30.987
What do we do about Christmas?

29:31.164 --> 29:32.831
Thanks a lot you guys.

29:47.647 --> 29:49.548
Knock knock!

29:50.783 --> 29:52.798
Are you busy right now?

29:53.468 --> 29:54.668
No.

29:54.821 --> 29:56.013
Good.

29:56.243 --> 29:58.144
Because I'm kidnapping you.

30:01.994 --> 30:03.061
Ha!

30:06.231 --> 30:07.832
You're insane.

30:07.857 --> 30:10.441
I was just trying to recreate
our Grand Theft Auto experience.

30:10.466 --> 30:11.845
Well, mission accomplished.

30:11.870 --> 30:13.738
I feel like a criminal again.

30:13.772 --> 30:14.939
Are we even allowed to be in here?

30:14.973 --> 30:16.674
Oh, no. No, probably not.

30:16.709 --> 30:17.842
Then let's go.

30:17.876 --> 30:19.580
I shouldn't be away from my fluids anyway.

30:19.605 --> 30:22.013
Dr. Hamburg said I need to
be on them for 24 to 48 hours

30:22.047 --> 30:23.681
and it's barely been 24.

30:23.716 --> 30:25.917
Man, you are being even more anal now,

30:25.951 --> 30:27.752
than you were in the sport's car.

30:27.786 --> 30:28.820
Come on.

30:28.854 --> 30:31.556
Hospital rules are not law.

30:31.590 --> 30:32.790
You know, they're...

30:32.825 --> 30:34.990
They're more like suggestions.

30:35.310 --> 30:37.111
We're supposed to keep those on.

30:37.146 --> 30:39.473
You really think that
glorified piece of tissue

30:39.498 --> 30:40.631
is doing anything?

30:40.666 --> 30:43.501
Listen, you asked me what
was on my bucket list.

30:43.535 --> 30:44.602
Well, what's on my list

30:44.636 --> 30:47.474
is for us to not worry tonight.

30:47.639 --> 30:49.835
You know who doesn't worry about anything?

30:50.376 --> 30:51.442
Kids.

30:51.477 --> 30:53.141
So can we just...

30:53.479 --> 30:55.763
Act like a couple of
kids for a little while?

30:56.315 --> 30:57.565
Huh?

30:58.317 --> 31:01.119
It's... it's my maybe dying wish.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.163
You're here early.

31:57.306 --> 31:59.434
Well, that's because we have a problem

31:59.459 --> 32:01.746
and we all have to have a talk.

32:01.780 --> 32:03.648
Well, we have to do it in an hour.

32:03.682 --> 32:05.450
I just had a cup of bran,

32:05.484 --> 32:07.718
and if I don't do my
morning walk right now,

32:07.753 --> 32:10.196
- my entire digestive system...
- Uh, Lynn?

32:10.221 --> 32:12.220
Your ass will survive.

32:12.658 --> 32:15.820
All right, just everybody listen up, okay?

32:16.495 --> 32:20.465
All right, look, uh... Last night...

32:20.499 --> 32:23.290
We all let our issues with
each other get the better of us.

32:23.315 --> 32:26.047
And we forgot to put April first.

32:26.531 --> 32:27.931
Except for Brenna,

32:27.956 --> 32:30.381
who's been putting her
sister first since day one.

32:30.418 --> 32:31.785
Yes, she has.

32:32.093 --> 32:34.595
And by the way, Brenna,
I don't think there's

32:34.629 --> 32:36.914
anyone here who's not
proud that you're gay.

32:37.064 --> 32:39.360
I don't really use that label.

32:39.385 --> 32:40.979
Or whatever the hell you are.

32:41.002 --> 32:42.337
Yeah, uh, the point is

32:42.362 --> 32:44.430
that Christmas is back on.

32:44.455 --> 32:45.722
But April said

32:45.747 --> 32:48.714
that she didn't want to see us
all together again because...

32:48.739 --> 32:51.512
Because she was just
trying to take care of us

32:51.546 --> 32:52.958
instead of herself.

32:52.983 --> 32:54.253
That's how April is.

32:54.278 --> 32:56.313
- I know that.
- Good.

32:56.338 --> 32:58.640
Then we both know our granddaughters

32:58.665 --> 33:01.109
and we can both be close to them.

33:01.623 --> 33:03.338
It's not a competition.

33:06.494 --> 33:08.295
Okay, um... Should we get

33:08.330 --> 33:10.197
the Christmas stuff out of the living room?

33:10.231 --> 33:12.199
Ho, ho, ho.

33:12.233 --> 33:13.538
Okay, let's go.

33:14.636 --> 33:16.538
Thank you for doing that.

33:17.505 --> 33:19.306
I wish I could be there.

33:19.341 --> 33:20.738
Yeah, me too.

33:26.021 --> 33:28.623
So, I feel like the
logical next step for you

33:28.648 --> 33:30.682
is the side-mullet.

33:30.893 --> 33:33.096
Maybe these haircuts are just fighting

33:33.121 --> 33:34.138
the inevitable.

33:35.621 --> 33:37.014
Do you want me to just shave it?

33:37.158 --> 33:38.225
No.

33:38.259 --> 33:39.549
Sorry.

33:39.574 --> 33:41.738
I know it's gonna happen
anyway, it's just...

33:43.264 --> 33:44.965
I don't know. It's kind of hard to explain

33:45.000 --> 33:46.551
if you're not going through it.

33:46.576 --> 33:48.778
Sign on the dotted line, roomie!

33:49.137 --> 33:50.871
Yay!

33:57.484 --> 33:58.912
Are you kidding me, Chris?

33:58.947 --> 34:00.814
Uh, Dr. Weaver's first name is Chris.

34:00.849 --> 34:03.697
Yeah, and apparently he just
met someone new, listen to this:

34:03.952 --> 34:05.919
"I just want to be fair to you.

34:05.954 --> 34:07.554
I respect you so much,

34:07.589 --> 34:09.790
I really enjoyed getting to know you.

34:09.824 --> 34:13.627
I know you'll have no trouble meeting
a wonderful guy who deserves you."

34:13.661 --> 34:14.661
Wow.

34:14.696 --> 34:16.268
Just... wow.

34:16.293 --> 34:19.632
Volunteering here was such a waste.

34:19.667 --> 34:20.972
- It's not a waste.
- Yeah.

34:20.996 --> 34:23.020
You're making a difference
in people's lives.

34:23.045 --> 34:25.572
Whatever. I wanted to make
a difference in my love life,

34:25.607 --> 34:27.474
and now no other doctor
here is gonna want to date me

34:27.509 --> 34:29.643
because they probably have
some kind of doctor code.

34:35.417 --> 34:37.525
Did I really just sign that lease?

34:38.553 --> 34:40.187
Any time you want to crash here...

34:40.221 --> 34:41.757
Oh, God...

34:44.866 --> 34:46.766
- Hey!
- Hey.

34:46.792 --> 34:50.030
Question: Why do people think
just because you're in the hospital

34:50.054 --> 34:51.748
you suddenly want to read self-help books,

34:51.774 --> 34:52.706
with names like,

34:52.741 --> 34:55.025
"unleash the warrior within."

34:55.130 --> 34:56.264
Thanks, aunt Kathy.

34:56.306 --> 34:57.325
I don't know.

34:58.581 --> 35:00.325
I need you to do something for me.

35:04.078 --> 35:05.125
Shave my head.

35:11.428 --> 35:12.933
Hang on just a second!

35:13.004 --> 35:14.364
Sorry.

35:14.398 --> 35:16.494
No, I just don't know if I'm ready.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.434
Sorry, I know it's only hair.

35:18.469 --> 35:19.669
No, I get it. It's...

35:19.703 --> 35:21.203
Traumatic.

35:22.339 --> 35:24.203
But hair does grow back.

35:24.775 --> 35:26.576
Hey, how about if I went first?

35:26.610 --> 35:28.211
I thought you didn't have
to shave your whole head,

35:28.245 --> 35:30.246
just the part where they make the incision?

35:30.281 --> 35:32.382
Doesn't mean I can't shave
my head if I want to, hmm?

35:32.416 --> 35:34.703
I'll show you mine if you show me yours?

35:35.219 --> 35:36.803
Scalps, I mean.

35:41.292 --> 35:42.425
Okay.

35:45.129 --> 35:46.362
Take it all off.

36:13.924 --> 36:16.159
You look like an alien.

36:17.181 --> 36:18.672
You look like a baby.

36:19.997 --> 36:21.603
I feel like one.

36:22.933 --> 36:24.100
It is kind of like we're...

36:24.532 --> 36:26.166
Both being reborn.

36:30.174 --> 36:32.842
So, what time do you
leave for surgery again?

36:32.876 --> 36:34.777
Uh, about a half an hour.

36:39.016 --> 36:40.578
So I'll see you in hell.

36:40.603 --> 36:42.085
Dude...

36:42.119 --> 36:43.753
I'm sorry.

36:43.787 --> 36:45.054
I...

36:45.537 --> 36:47.171
Didn't know what to say.

36:48.626 --> 36:50.103
It's okay.

36:51.695 --> 36:53.663
I know you don't like to make a big deal

36:53.697 --> 36:55.598
of goodbyes so...

36:55.633 --> 36:57.003
I won't.

36:57.768 --> 36:59.103
See you.

37:03.352 --> 37:05.186
No, hey.

38:04.134 --> 38:05.268
What?

38:05.302 --> 38:07.403
It's Christmas!

38:11.892 --> 38:13.593
It's May!

38:13.618 --> 38:15.211
So what?

38:15.877 --> 38:17.374
I think you'll like this better

38:17.399 --> 38:19.691
- than the last one I gave you.
- Oh...

38:21.299 --> 38:23.630
God, you guys...

38:30.556 --> 38:31.946
How sweet.

38:32.492 --> 38:34.293
I know we all acted

38:34.318 --> 38:36.245
like teenagers yesterday, and I'm sorry.

38:37.204 --> 38:38.204
That's okay.

38:40.845 --> 38:43.113
But can I be honest
with you about something?

38:43.326 --> 38:46.055
Well, of course, pumpkin.

38:47.512 --> 38:49.734
The way you talk about me being sick

38:49.759 --> 38:51.645
and fighting this,

38:52.639 --> 38:54.574
it puts a lot of pressure on me.

38:54.794 --> 38:56.465
Like, I have to be strong

38:56.524 --> 38:58.668
all the time and if I'm not...

38:58.693 --> 38:59.989
I've failed.

39:00.042 --> 39:01.295
Oh, God.

39:01.320 --> 39:03.506
I'm sorry I made you feel that way.

39:04.948 --> 39:07.120
I only talk like that because

39:07.145 --> 39:09.530
I want to feel that we have the power

39:09.779 --> 39:12.518
to affect the outcome

39:12.543 --> 39:14.706
of all this.

39:15.859 --> 39:18.320
Because if we don't...

39:18.671 --> 39:20.549
It scares me.

39:20.994 --> 39:23.042
I already lost a son.

39:23.415 --> 39:25.065
And I don't even want to think

39:25.065 --> 39:26.808
- about losing you...
- Hey!

39:27.302 --> 39:29.170
Someone once told me that

39:29.195 --> 39:31.296
being a survivor makes your life richer.

39:31.593 --> 39:33.161
And I think that

39:33.186 --> 39:34.753
that's kind of true.

39:34.778 --> 39:37.807
I've lost a lot, but
I'm also gaining things.

39:37.879 --> 39:38.946
Like, I'm...

39:38.980 --> 39:41.132
Closer with my best
friends because of this.

39:41.157 --> 39:42.992
And, I've made new friends.

39:43.017 --> 39:45.670
I get a bonus Christmas with you guys!

39:45.787 --> 39:47.521
- I mean...
- Look at you.

39:47.556 --> 39:48.723
"Bonus Christmas."

39:54.878 --> 39:57.112
I'm glad you all

39:57.137 --> 40:00.267
get to spend so much
time together these days.

40:00.292 --> 40:02.460
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

40:02.485 --> 40:05.154
All your mom and I ever wanted was for you

40:05.179 --> 40:07.080
to have a family.

40:09.700 --> 40:11.440
Now I see that you do.

40:14.738 --> 40:16.240
Thanks, pop.

40:20.680 --> 40:22.820
It's mom, here.

40:22.845 --> 40:25.309
Aww, I'm sad she's not here.

40:25.334 --> 40:27.340
Go look out the window.

40:31.989 --> 40:34.540
- Hello?
-  Can you see me?

40:35.935 --> 40:38.570
- Mom!
- Hey, sweet girl!

40:38.595 --> 40:41.864
Aww, I'm sorry I couldn't
be up there in person,

40:41.898 --> 40:44.633
but you know I wouldn't miss a
holiday with you for anything.

40:44.668 --> 40:46.936
Even Christmas in May.

40:46.970 --> 40:49.236
I miss you so much.

40:49.606 --> 40:50.840
I miss you, too.

40:51.076 --> 40:52.964
Are you feeling any better?

40:52.989 --> 40:54.877
I am now.

41:18.568 --> 41:19.935
Vent rate within normal range.

41:26.676 --> 41:28.598
Looking at .7 diameter.

41:32.749 --> 41:34.515
His heart rate is dropping.

41:34.540 --> 41:37.500
Push .5 atropine now.

41:37.525 --> 41:38.620
Yes, Doctor.

41:39.141 --> 41:40.708
Recessed breath signs.

41:41.758 --> 41:43.592
Patient's decompensating.

41:43.627 --> 41:45.650
He's flatlining.
