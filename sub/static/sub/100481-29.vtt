LIKE THAT ALL DAY HERE IN

02:25.180 --> 02:25.240
NEW YORK.

02:25.259 --> 02:26.120
THERE WAS A MOOD HERE THAT

02:26.139 --> 02:27.020
CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A

"REVERSE 9/11."

ESPECIALLY AT THE END OF A TRULY

02:46.210 --> 02:49.009
DRAINING WEEK.

02:49.030 --> 02:50.139
AND TONIGHT WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT

02:50.159 --> 02:52.229
BE WORTH MAPPING EXACTLY HOW WE

02:52.250 --> 02:54.060
GOT TO THIS POINT OVER THE LAST

02:54.079 --> 02:56.129
SEVEN DAYS, BECAUSE AT THE START

02:56.150 --> 02:57.289
OF THIS WEEK, WE ALL KNEW THAT,

02:58.009 --> 02:58.150
DUE TO THE PANDEMIC, THIS

02:58.170 --> 02:59.099
ELECTION WAS GOING TO BE

02:59.120 --> 03:00.129
DIFFERENT.

03:00.150 --> 03:01.129
CRUCIALLY, THAT IT WAS GOING TO

03:01.150 --> 03:02.030
REQUIRE MORE PATIENCE THAN

03:02.050 --> 03:03.189
USUAL.

03:03.210 --> 03:05.050

03:05.069 --> 03:06.229

03:06.250 --> 03:08.020
SEEMED TO IMMEDIATELY FORGET

03:08.039 --> 03:09.169
THAT, BECAUSE STARTING THAT

03:09.189 --> 03:10.189
EVENING, ALMOST EVERY NEWS

03:10.210 --> 03:11.289
CHANNEL WAS OVERTAKEN BY SOME

03:12.009 --> 03:13.250
VERSION OF A GUY PLAYING WITH A

03:13.270 --> 03:16.039
BIG SCREEN WHILE SOMEONE COMES

03:16.060 --> 03:16.229
IN TO INTERRUPT AND PESTER THEM

03:16.250 --> 03:18.030
WITH QUESTIONS.

03:18.050 --> 03:19.199
IT WAS BASICALLY THE EQUIVALENT

03:19.219 --> 03:20.229
OF WATCHING THE SECURITY FOOTAGE

03:20.250 --> 03:22.099
AT A BEST BUY FOR FOUR STRAIGHT

03:22.120 --> 03:24.060

03:24.079 --> 03:26.030

03:26.050 --> 03:27.259
THEIR BEST TO BE PATIENT, AS

03:27.280 --> 03:29.180
THINGS DRAGGED ON, IT WAS CLEAR

03:29.199 --> 03:31.060
THEY JUST COULDN'T DO IT --

03:31.079 --> 03:33.039

03:37.289 --> 03:39.030
GOING TO TAKE TO COUNT ALL THE

03:39.050 --> 03:39.259
VOTES, COMMISSIONER?

03:39.280 --> 03:41.120
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING

03:41.139 --> 03:43.030
HEARING REPORTERS TALK ABOUT,

03:43.050 --> 03:44.189
"LISTEN, EVERYBODY, THIS IS

03:44.210 --> 03:46.159
GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME," AND

03:46.180 --> 03:47.189
THEN THE POLLS CLOSE AND THEN

03:47.210 --> 03:49.030
IT'S, "WHY DON'T YOU HAVE THE

03:49.050 --> 03:50.180
RESULTS YET?"

03:50.199 --> 03:52.139
SO EVERYONE NEEDS TO RECALIBRATE

03:52.159 --> 03:54.099

03:54.120 --> 03:59.180
>> I RESEMBLE THAT REMARK.

03:59.199 --> 03:59.259
[LAUGHTER]

03:59.280 --> 04:02.000
>> IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

04:02.020 --> 04:03.099

04:03.120 --> 04:04.030
SPEAKING OF -- THAT WAS A GOOD

04:04.050 --> 04:05.009
ANSWER.

04:05.030 --> 04:06.080
BUT ARE YOU TALKING HOURS, ARE

04:06.099 --> 04:08.229
YOU TALKING DAYS?

04:08.250 --> 04:10.000
>> John: HE DOESN'T FUCKING

04:10.020 --> 04:11.189
KNOW, LEMON!

04:11.210 --> 04:12.240
LEAVE THE MAN ALONE!

04:12.259 --> 04:13.289
AT THAT POINT, IT WOULD HAVE

04:14.009 --> 04:14.280
BEEN JUST AS PRODUCTIVE TO ASK

04:15.000 --> 04:16.089
HIM, "WHEN WILL PENGUINS LEARN

04:16.110 --> 04:17.100
HOW TO FLY?"

04:17.120 --> 04:18.220
OR "WHEN IS MICHAEL KEATON GOING

04:18.240 --> 04:19.269
TO WIN AN OSCAR?"

04:19.290 --> 04:21.160
OR, "WHAT DOES THE REST OF THE

04:21.180 --> 04:22.220
PRINGLES GUY'S BODY LOOK LIKE?

04:22.240 --> 04:23.199
IS HE TALL OR SHORT?

04:23.220 --> 04:24.120
DOES HE HAVE A LOT OF BODY HAIR

04:24.139 --> 04:25.230
OR IS HE COMPLETELY SMOOTH?

04:25.250 --> 04:26.220
WHEN WILL YOU BE ABLE TO TELL ME

04:26.240 --> 04:28.009
WHAT HIS NIPPLES LOOK LIKE?

04:28.029 --> 04:28.290
ARE YOU TALKING HOURS, OR ARE

04:29.009 --> 04:30.199
YOU TALKING DAYS?"

04:30.220 --> 04:33.029
WHAT WAS ALSO ENTIRELY

04:33.050 --> 04:34.220
PREDICTABLE WAS HOW TRUMP WAS

04:34.240 --> 04:36.110
GOING TO REACT AS THE COUNT

04:36.129 --> 04:37.209
SLOWLY UNFOLDED, BECAUSE LONG

04:37.230 --> 04:39.180
BEFORE RESULTS WERE IN, HE TOOK

04:39.199 --> 04:41.040
ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT HE

04:41.060 --> 04:42.139
WAS AHEAD IN SOME STATES TO

04:42.159 --> 04:44.139
DECLARE A PREMATURE, COMPLETELY

04:44.159 --> 04:46.159
UNFOUNDED VICTORY.

04:46.180 --> 04:48.170
AT 2:30 A.M. ON WEDNESDAY, HE

04:48.189 --> 04:49.159
DELIVERED THIS NIGHTMARISH

04:49.180 --> 04:51.149
SPEECH FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

04:51.170 --> 04:52.199
>> THIS IS A FRAUD ON THE

04:52.220 --> 04:55.090
AMERICAN PUBLIC.

04:55.110 --> 04:57.029
THIS IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR

04:57.050 --> 04:59.110
COUNTRY.

04:59.129 --> 05:01.050
WE WERE GETTING READY TO WIN

05:01.069 --> 05:02.279
THIS ELECTION.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.110
FRANKLY, WE DID WIN THIS

05:05.129 --> 05:07.269

05:07.290 --> 05:08.290
SO WE'LL BE GOING TO THE U.S.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.199
SUPREME COURT.

05:10.220 --> 05:15.040
WE WANT ALL VOTING TO STOP.

05:15.060 --> 05:17.250
WE DON'T WANT THEM TO FIND ANY

05:17.269 --> 05:19.230
BALLOTS AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING

05:19.250 --> 05:20.189
AND ADD THEM TO THE LIST.

05:20.209 --> 05:24.209
OKAY?

05:24.230 --> 05:27.060
>> John: UH, NO.

05:27.079 --> 05:30.160
IT'S NOT OKAY.

05:30.180 --> 05:31.110
IT'S NOT OKAY AT ALL.

05:31.129 --> 05:32.100
FOR A START, YOU CAN'T

05:32.120 --> 05:32.259
JUST THREATEN TO GO TO THE

05:32.279 --> 05:33.240
SUPREME COURT WHEN THINGS AREN'T

05:33.259 --> 05:34.060
GOING YOUR WAY.

05:34.079 --> 05:34.240
IT'S THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE

05:34.259 --> 05:35.120
LAND, NOT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL

05:35.139 --> 05:35.259
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.

05:35.279 --> 05:36.240
AND SECOND, THEY WEREN'T

05:36.259 --> 05:37.149
"FINDING" BALLOTS, THEY WERE

05:37.170 --> 05:38.269
COUNTING THEM.

05:38.290 --> 05:40.019
AND COUNTING AND FINDING ARE NOT

05:40.040 --> 05:40.279
THE SAME THING.

05:41.000 --> 05:41.279
THAT'S WHY THE MOVIE

05:42.000 --> 05:43.100
"FINDING NEMO" WASN'T CALLED

05:43.120 --> 05:46.149
"COUNTING NEMO."

05:46.170 --> 05:47.090
'CAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A

05:47.110 --> 05:48.120
VERY DIFFERENT AND MUCH SHORTER

05:48.139 --> 05:49.019
MOVIE.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.009
ONE NEMO.

05:50.029 --> 05:50.290
THE END.

05:51.009 --> 05:52.100
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT PRESS

05:52.120 --> 05:55.230

05:55.250 --> 05:57.269

05:57.290 --> 05:59.100
SOON-TO-BE-FORMER PRESIDENT AND

05:59.120 --> 06:00.050
HIS CAMP DOING ABSOLUTELY

06:00.069 --> 06:00.189
EVERYTHING THEY COULD

06:00.209 --> 06:01.079
THINK OF TO SUBVERT THIS

06:01.100 --> 06:02.019
ELECTION.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.050
ON WEDNESDAY, AFTER THE COUNT IN

06:03.069 --> 06:04.110
MICHIGAN BEGAN TO FAVOR BIDEN,

06:04.129 --> 06:05.279
TRUMP TWEETED OUT "WE HEREBY

06:06.000 --> 06:07.100
CLAIM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN."

06:07.120 --> 06:08.060
WHICH IS CLEARLY NOT HOW IT

06:08.079 --> 06:10.120
WORKS.

06:10.139 --> 06:11.250
CALLING DIBS ON STATES IS NOT

06:11.269 --> 06:13.240
HOW WE ELECT PRESIDENTS.

06:13.259 --> 06:16.199
WE USE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE,

06:16.220 --> 06:18.279
WHICH IS AT LEAST 3% LESS STUPID

06:19.000 --> 06:20.060
THAN THAT.

06:20.079 --> 06:22.019
THE VERY SAME DAY, THE

06:22.040 --> 06:23.040
PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL LAWYER AND

06:23.060 --> 06:24.220
RECENT STAR OF THE "BORAT"

06:24.240 --> 06:26.009
MOVIE, RUDY GIULIANI, ARRIVED IN

06:26.029 --> 06:27.160
PENNSYLVANIA TO TRY AND STOP

06:27.180 --> 06:28.149
THEM FROM COUNTING THE VOTES

06:28.170 --> 06:30.199
THAT WERE STILL REMAINING --

06:30.220 --> 06:32.069
WHICH STOOD AT NEARLY A MILLION

06:32.090 --> 06:33.189
THAT MORNING, MOST FROM HEAVILY

06:33.209 --> 06:35.100
DEMOCRATIC AREAS -- AND DID SO

06:35.120 --> 06:37.050
WITH THIS IMPASSIONED SPEECH.

06:37.069 --> 06:38.009
>> HOW MANY VOTES DO WE HAVE TO

06:38.029 --> 06:40.139
BE AHEAD?

06:40.159 --> 06:43.129
400,000 IS NOT ENOUGH?

06:43.149 --> 06:45.069
WITH 80 PLUS PERCENT COUNTED?

06:45.090 --> 06:46.139
I THINK THERE'S ONLY 14% OF THE

06:46.159 --> 06:48.269
VOTE TO GO.

06:48.290 --> 06:51.149
DO YOU THINK WE'RE STUPID?

06:51.170 --> 06:52.290
YOU THINK WE'RE FOOLS?

06:53.009 --> 06:53.269
>> John: YEAH.

06:53.290 --> 06:55.230
YEAH, WE DO.

06:55.250 --> 06:57.290
YEAH.

06:58.009 --> 06:59.139
AND, UH, ACTUALLY, THIS IS A BIT

06:59.159 --> 07:00.019
AWKWARD, BECAUSE WE HAD SPACE

07:00.040 --> 07:00.290
FOR A JOKE HERE, BUT THAT TOOK

07:01.009 --> 07:01.250
NO TIME AT ALL.

07:01.269 --> 07:02.290
SO TELL YOU WHAT: INSTEAD, LET'S

07:03.009 --> 07:03.209
LOOK AT THIS RACCOON-SHAPED

07:03.230 --> 07:04.100
COOKIE JAR WITH A RACCOON IN IT.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.290
DID YOU EAT ALL THE COOKIES?

07:06.009 --> 07:06.120
I BET YOU DID.

07:06.139 --> 07:07.259
THOSE COOKIES HAVE GONE FROM

07:07.279 --> 07:09.029
BEING INSIDE ONE RACCOON TO

07:09.050 --> 07:13.220
BEING INSIDE ANOTHER.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.040
WHAT AN ABSOLUTE DELIGHT.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.029
ANYWAY, GIULIANI'S PRESS

07:16.050 --> 07:16.250
CONFERENCE WAS TRULY UNHINGED,

07:16.269 --> 07:18.050
WITH HIM THROWING AROUND WILD

07:18.069 --> 07:19.019
ACCUSATIONS WITH ABSOLUTELY NO

07:19.040 --> 07:20.100
EVIDENCE.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.290
AND PERHAPS THE BEST RESPONSE TO

07:22.009 --> 07:22.290
IT CAME FROM JOHN FETTERMAN,

07:23.009 --> 07:24.019
PENNSYLVANIA'S LIEUTENANT

07:24.040 --> 07:26.050
GOVERNOR:

07:26.069 --> 07:29.189
>> TO COME IN AND STAND ON -- ON

07:29.209 --> 07:30.170
A STREET CORNER IN PHILADELPHIA

07:30.189 --> 07:34.189
TO SAY, "WE WON PENNSYLVANIA,"

07:34.209 --> 07:35.259
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, LIKE, LOL.

07:35.279 --> 07:36.180
I MEAN, LIKE, IT IS JUST

07:36.199 --> 07:42.009
BIZARRE.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.069
IT IS LIKE A BAD, BAD

07:43.090 --> 07:43.230
"HOUSE OF CARDS" EPISODE.

07:43.250 --> 07:44.120
>> John: YEAH, HE'S RIGHT.

07:44.139 --> 07:45.040
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR STONE COLD

07:45.060 --> 07:45.269
IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

07:45.290 --> 07:46.250
BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE

07:46.269 --> 07:48.120
"HOUSE OF CARDS" IN THAT IT'S

07:48.139 --> 07:50.100
FULL OF POLITICAL INTRIGUE,

07:50.120 --> 07:51.269
THERE'S A SEXUAL PREDATOR

07:51.290 --> 07:53.060
PRETENDING TO BE PRESIDENT AT

07:53.079 --> 07:54.209
THE VERY HEART OF IT, AND IT'S

07:54.230 --> 07:55.259
GONE ON FOR AT LEAST FOUR

07:55.279 --> 07:57.139
SEASONS TOO LONG.

07:57.159 --> 07:58.209
AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, THE

07:58.230 --> 07:59.189
TRUMP CAMP'S PROTESTS WERE

07:59.209 --> 08:00.259
CONSISTENTLY INCONSISTENT IN

08:00.279 --> 08:02.019
THEIR MESSAGING, PRIMARILY

08:02.040 --> 08:04.069
BECAUSE, EARLY ON, IN SOME

08:04.089 --> 08:05.259
STATES, TRUMP LOOKED LIKE HE WAS

08:05.279 --> 08:06.290
AHEAD, WHILE IN OTHERS, HE

08:07.009 --> 08:08.199
LOOKED LIKE HE WAS BEHIND, WHICH

08:08.220 --> 08:10.139
MEANT THAT IN MICHIGAN, WHERE HE

08:10.160 --> 08:13.029
LED EARLY ON, HIS SUPPORTERS

08:13.050 --> 08:13.230
SHOWED UP AT A DETROIT

08:13.250 --> 08:14.149
BALLOT-COUNTING SITE TO CHANT

08:14.170 --> 08:15.180
THIS:

08:15.199 --> 08:16.259
>> STOP THE COUNT!

08:16.279 --> 08:18.089
STOP THE COUNT!

08:18.110 --> 08:26.189
STOP THE COUNT!

08:26.209 --> 08:27.079
>> John: "STOP THE COUNT."

08:27.100 --> 08:28.000
RIGHT.

08:28.019 --> 08:28.170
BUT IN ARIZONA, WHERE TRUMP

08:28.189 --> 08:29.089
SEEMED TO BE BEHIND, HIS

08:29.110 --> 08:29.250
SUPPORTERS CHANTED THIS:

08:29.269 --> 08:30.209
>> COUNT THE VOTES!

08:30.230 --> 08:31.019
COUNT THE VOTES!

08:31.040 --> 08:32.269
COUNT THE VOTES!

08:32.289 --> 08:35.000
>> John: NOW, SETTING ASIDE THE

08:35.019 --> 08:36.019
ABSURDITY OF TWO GROUPS ON THE

08:36.039 --> 08:37.070
SAME SIDE SHOUTING COMPLETELY

08:37.090 --> 08:39.100
OPPOSITE INSTRUCTIONS, IT IS

08:39.120 --> 08:41.230
WORTH TAKING A MINUTE ON

08:41.250 --> 08:42.240
JUST HOW WEIRD IT IS THAT ONE OF

08:42.259 --> 08:43.080
THOSE INSTRUCTIONS IS

08:43.100 --> 08:46.289
"COUNT THE VOTES."

08:47.009 --> 08:48.179
BECAUSE THEY WERE.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.210
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE

08:49.230 --> 08:50.090
BALLOT COUNTERS WERE DOING.

08:50.110 --> 08:51.190
IT'D BE LIKE A DAD CHANTING AT

08:51.210 --> 08:52.250
HIS TEENAGE SON'S BEDROOM DOOR,

08:52.269 --> 08:54.019
"BEAT THAT MEAT!

08:54.039 --> 08:55.129
BEAT THAT MEAT!"

08:55.149 --> 08:56.250
HE IS!

08:56.269 --> 08:58.120
HE'S DOING IT!

08:58.139 --> 09:00.000
YOU REALLY DON'T NEED TO CHEER

09:00.019 --> 09:00.070
HIM ON.

09:00.090 --> 09:00.250
IN FACT, ALL YOU'RE DOING IS

09:00.269 --> 09:01.210
MAKING IT WAY HARDER FOR HIM TO

09:01.230 --> 09:03.220
FINISH.

09:03.240 --> 09:05.070
AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE

09:05.090 --> 09:06.179
INFORMATION VACUUM THAT FORMED

09:06.200 --> 09:07.200
IN THOSE THREE DAYS PROVIDED

09:07.220 --> 09:08.279
AMPLE SPACE FOR TRUMP AND HIS

09:09.000 --> 09:10.179
SUPPORTERS TO JUST THROW

09:10.200 --> 09:12.259
COMPLETE BULLSHIT AROUND.

09:12.279 --> 09:14.169
AT ONE POINT, TRUMP'S TWITTER

09:14.190 --> 09:15.279
TIMELINE LOOKED LIKE THIS, WITH

09:16.000 --> 09:18.200
A WHOLE RUN OF TWEETS FLAGGED AS

09:18.220 --> 09:19.230
"DISPUTED OR MISLEADING."

09:19.250 --> 09:21.059
MEANWHILE, GIULIANI WAS TWEETING

09:21.080 --> 09:23.120
OUT THIS ARTICLE AND IMPLYING

09:23.139 --> 09:24.139
21,000 DEAD PEOPLE HAD VOTED IN

09:24.159 --> 09:25.200
PENNSYLVANIA -- WHICH THEY

09:25.220 --> 09:29.090
HADN'T.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.169
ALSO RUMORS WERE FLYING AROUND

09:30.190 --> 09:31.220
THAT TRUMP BALLOTS WERE BEING

09:31.240 --> 09:32.110
DISQUALIFIED IN ARIZONA BECAUSE

09:32.129 --> 09:35.080
SHARPIES HAD BEEN USED TO FILL

09:35.100 --> 09:36.059
THEM OUT, WHICH WAS FALSE.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.059
AND ERIC TRUMP TWEETED OUT A

09:37.080 --> 09:39.240
FAKE VIDEO OF BALLOTS IN

09:39.259 --> 09:41.029
VIRGINIA BEACH BEING BURNED --

09:41.049 --> 09:42.019
A VIDEO THAT THE CITY ITSELF HAD

09:42.039 --> 09:43.090
DEBUNKED A DAY BEFORE HE TWEETED

09:43.110 --> 09:45.110
IT.

09:45.129 --> 09:46.120
AND THAT IS REALLY A SHAME,

09:46.139 --> 09:47.240
BECAUSE NORMALLY THE TRUMP SONS

09:47.259 --> 09:48.210
ARE SO GOOD AT GETTING TO THE

09:48.230 --> 09:50.149
TRUTH -- YOU KNOW, LIKE WHEN

09:50.169 --> 09:52.059
THEY SOLVED THE MYSTERY OF

09:52.080 --> 09:53.220
"CAN A BEARD ACTUALLY MAKE

09:53.240 --> 09:55.240
SOMEONE LOOK MORE LIKE A CHILD?"

09:55.259 --> 09:57.000
THE ANSWER TURNED OUT TO BE A

09:57.019 --> 09:58.129
RESOUNDING YES.

09:58.149 --> 10:02.080
GOOD WORK, GUMSHOES.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.149
BUT CONSPIRACY THEORIZING RAN SO

10:04.169 --> 10:05.269
RAMPANT THIS WEEK THAT, DURING A

10:05.289 --> 10:07.129
PRESS BRIEFING FROM A NEVADA

10:07.149 --> 10:09.000
VOTING REGISTRAR, THIS HAPPENED:

10:09.019 --> 10:10.039
>> THE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY IS

10:10.059 --> 10:11.129
STEALING THE ELECTION!

10:11.149 --> 10:12.259
THE MEDIA IS COVERING IT UP!

10:12.279 --> 10:14.080
THE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY IS

10:14.100 --> 10:16.129
STEALING THIS ELECTION!

10:16.149 --> 10:17.049
THE MEDIA IS COVERING IT UP!

10:17.070 --> 10:18.159
THE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY IS

10:18.179 --> 10:19.200
STEALING THIS ELECTION!

10:19.220 --> 10:20.259
THE MEDIA IS COVERING IT UP!

10:20.279 --> 10:22.029
WE WANT OUR FREEDOM FOR THE

10:22.049 --> 10:23.019
WORLD!

10:23.039 --> 10:24.269
GIVE US OUR FREEDOM, JOE BIDEN!

10:24.289 --> 10:25.190
JOE BIDEN IS COVERING UP THIS

10:25.210 --> 10:26.179
ELECTION!

10:26.200 --> 10:33.029
HE'S STEALING IT!

10:33.049 --> 10:34.019
>> [SIGHS]

10:34.039 --> 10:34.230
WHERE WERE WE?

10:34.250 --> 10:37.210
WHAT WAS THE LAST QUESTION?

10:37.230 --> 10:38.269
>> John: OKAY, THERE IS SO MUCH

10:38.289 --> 10:39.250
TO DEAL WITH THERE.

10:39.269 --> 10:41.080
THERE'S THE ARCTIC COOL

10:41.100 --> 10:41.250
DISPLAYED BY THAT REGISTRAR

10:41.269 --> 10:42.129
WHILE HE WAS BEING INTERRUPTED

10:42.149 --> 10:44.009
BY A WALKING INTERNET COMMENT.

10:44.029 --> 10:45.070
THEN THERE WAS THAT MAN'S SHIRT,

10:45.090 --> 10:47.000
FEATURING WHAT I ASSUME WERE HIS

10:47.019 --> 10:48.029
THREE FAVORITE THINGS.

10:48.049 --> 10:48.240
WHICH I'M LEGITIMATELY JEALOUS

10:48.259 --> 10:49.190
OF, BECAUSE NOW I WANT A TANK

10:49.210 --> 10:52.049
TOP WITH MY THREE FAVORITE

10:52.070 --> 10:54.059
THINGS ON IT -- SPECIFICALLY,

10:54.080 --> 10:54.240
OVERSIGHT, FOIA REQUESTS, AND

10:54.259 --> 10:58.250
HAMSTERS IN SPEEDOS.

10:58.269 --> 11:00.210
NOW THAT IS A SHIRT.

11:00.230 --> 11:03.210
BUT I THINK MY FAVORITE THING IS

11:03.230 --> 11:05.029
JUST HOW PAINFULLY CLEAR IT IS

11:05.049 --> 11:06.169
THAT THAT GUY WAS EXPECTING TO

11:06.190 --> 11:07.049
GET DRAGGED AWAY AND WAS THEN

11:07.070 --> 11:07.240
COMPLETELY STUCK WHEN IT DIDN'T

11:07.259 --> 11:08.279
HAPPEN.

11:09.000 --> 11:09.289
"THE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY IS

11:10.009 --> 11:14.049
STEALING OUR FREEDOM!

11:14.070 --> 11:15.149
THE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY IS --

11:15.169 --> 11:15.259
REALLY?

11:15.279 --> 11:16.179
GUYS?

11:16.200 --> 11:17.029
NOTHING?

11:17.049 --> 11:17.250
NO ONE'S GONNA ESCORT ME OUTTA

11:17.269 --> 11:18.159
HERE?

11:18.179 --> 11:19.169
'CAUSE HONESTLY, I WAS REALLY

11:19.190 --> 11:20.059
COUNTING ON SOMEONE TOSSING ME

11:20.080 --> 11:20.230
IN A CAR AND TAKING ME AWAY.

11:20.250 --> 11:21.230
I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A RIDE

11:21.250 --> 11:23.250
HOME OTHERWISE.

11:23.269 --> 11:25.190
ALL RIGHT, I GUESS I'LL WALK.

11:25.210 --> 11:27.269
HAVE A GOOD DAY, EVERYONE.

11:27.289 --> 11:28.169
PIZZAGATE WAS A 9/11 OR

11:28.190 --> 11:30.269
WHATEVER."

11:30.289 --> 11:36.110
AND IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF THIS,

11:36.129 --> 11:37.149
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS LOUDLY

11:37.169 --> 11:38.139
ANNOUNCING THAT IT WAS FILING

11:38.159 --> 11:39.019
MULTIPLE LAWSUITS IN MULTIPLE

11:39.039 --> 11:40.000
STATES, TRYING TO CAST A CLOUD

11:40.019 --> 11:43.240
OVER THE WHOLE PROCESS.

11:43.259 --> 11:44.139
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW JUST

11:44.159 --> 11:45.279
HOW RIDICULOUS THOSE LAWSUITS

11:46.000 --> 11:46.110
WERE AND STILL ARE.

11:46.129 --> 11:47.250
ONE CASE IN GEORGIA CENTERED ON

11:47.269 --> 11:48.120
A POLL WATCHER WHO "LEFT THE

11:48.139 --> 11:49.029
ROOM" AND THOUGHT THAT A STACK

11:49.049 --> 11:50.059
OF 53 BALLOTS THAT MAY OR MAY

11:50.080 --> 11:52.100
NOT HAVE ARRIVED LATE MIGHT OR

11:52.120 --> 11:53.169
MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN COUNTED

11:53.190 --> 11:55.159
WHILE THEY WERE AWAY.

11:55.179 --> 11:57.009
ALTHOUGH THE POLL WATCHER

11:57.029 --> 11:58.139
COULDN'T SAY FOR SURE BECAUSE,

11:58.159 --> 11:59.190
AGAIN, HE HAD LEFT THE ROOM.

11:59.210 --> 12:01.009
THAT PARTICULAR CASE WAS

12:01.029 --> 12:02.110
DISMISSED BY A JUDGE BECAUSE,

12:02.129 --> 12:04.070
AND I QUOTE, "THE COURT FINDS

12:04.090 --> 12:05.210
THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE."

12:05.230 --> 12:06.230
MEANWHILE, IN MICHIGAN,

12:06.250 --> 12:08.070
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN REQUESTED

12:08.090 --> 12:09.190
THAT ABSENTEE BALLOTS STOP

12:09.210 --> 12:11.000
BEING COUNTED AFTER -- AND THIS

12:11.019 --> 12:12.190
IS KEY -- THE COUNTING HAD

12:12.210 --> 12:13.200
ESSENTIALLY BEEN FINISHED IN THE

12:13.220 --> 12:15.019
STATE.

12:15.039 --> 12:16.210
THAT SUIT RELIED ON ONE

12:16.230 --> 12:18.190
POLL WATCHER HAVING HEARD A

12:18.210 --> 12:19.059
RUMOR FROM SOMEONE ELSE THAT

12:19.080 --> 12:20.039
SOME LATE BALLOTS WERE BEING

12:20.059 --> 12:22.029
COUNTED.

12:22.049 --> 12:24.159
AND WHEN THE JUDGE POINTED OUT

12:24.179 --> 12:25.120
THAT THAT WAS TOTAL HEARSAY, THE

12:25.139 --> 12:27.179
TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S LAWYER TRIED TO

12:27.200 --> 12:28.070
WRIGGLE OUT OF IT BEFORE BEING

12:28.090 --> 12:29.250
SLAPPED DOWN HARD.

12:29.269 --> 12:34.039
>> THIS IS A FIRST-HAND, FACTUAL

12:34.059 --> 12:37.070
STATEMENT MADE BY MISS CONERAN,

12:37.090 --> 12:40.000
AND SHE HAS MADE THAT STATEMENT

12:40.019 --> 12:41.250
BASED ON HER OWN FIRST-HAND

12:41.269 --> 12:42.220
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AND KNOWLEDGE,

12:42.240 --> 12:43.190
WHICH --

12:43.210 --> 12:44.200
>> "I HEARD SOMEBODY ELSE SAY

12:44.220 --> 12:45.159
SOMETHING."

12:45.179 --> 12:46.159
TELL ME WHY THAT'S NOT HEARSAY?

12:46.179 --> 12:47.080
COME ON NOW.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.039
>> John: YEAH.

12:48.059 --> 12:51.210
"COME ON NOW."

12:51.230 --> 12:53.129
AND, LOOK, I'M NO LEGAL EXPERT,

12:53.149 --> 12:55.009
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S NOT A

12:55.029 --> 12:56.080
GREAT SIGN FOR YOUR CASE WHEN A

12:56.100 --> 12:57.139
JUDGE GIVES YOU THE JUDICIAL

12:57.159 --> 12:58.139
EQUIVALENT OF "FUCK OUTTA HERE."

12:58.159 --> 12:59.149
NOW, ONE BIG TRUMP COMPLAINT

12:59.169 --> 13:00.230
THAT HE'S MAKING A LOT RIGHT

13:00.250 --> 13:01.250
NOW, SO YOU'LL PROBABLY BE

13:01.269 --> 13:04.080
HEARING IT FOR THE REST OF YOUR

13:04.100 --> 13:04.289
LIFE, IS THAT THE ELECTION IS

13:05.009 --> 13:06.059
ILLEGITIMATE BECAUSE REPUBLICAN

13:06.080 --> 13:07.259
POLL WATCHERS WEREN'T GIVEN

13:07.279 --> 13:09.000
ACCESS TO THE BALLOT-COUNTING IN

13:09.019 --> 13:11.070
PENNSYLVANIA.

13:11.090 --> 13:12.110
HE ACTUALLY TWEETED ON SATURDAY,

13:12.129 --> 13:13.220
"BAD THINGS HAPPENED WHICH OUR

13:13.240 --> 13:14.159
OBSERVERS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO

13:14.179 --> 13:15.289
SEE."

13:16.009 --> 13:17.070
WHICH IS A TOUGH CHARGE TO MAKE

13:17.090 --> 13:19.059
STICK, BECAUSE -- BY THE NATURE

13:19.080 --> 13:20.250
OF THE ACCUSATION -- YOU DIDN'T

13:20.269 --> 13:23.059
SEE THEM.

13:23.080 --> 13:24.169
BUT THE CLAIM WAS ACTUALLY EVEN

13:24.190 --> 13:25.200
MORE MERITLESS THAN IT APPEARS,

13:25.220 --> 13:27.100
WHICH, OF ALL NETWORKS, FOX NEWS

13:27.120 --> 13:28.269
POINTED OUT.

13:28.289 --> 13:30.279
>> THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS SAID

13:31.000 --> 13:32.230
THAT THEY WANTED TO HAVE THEIR

13:32.250 --> 13:36.100
POLL WATCHERS THERE, AND I GUESS

13:36.120 --> 13:37.200
THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE ASKED

13:37.220 --> 13:38.289
TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR

13:39.009 --> 13:40.049
SOMETHING THAT THEY SAY THEY

13:40.070 --> 13:43.019
WEREN'T EVEN ABLE TO PARTICIPATE

13:43.039 --> 13:44.029
IN OR TO BE ABLE TO SEE, AND SO

13:44.049 --> 13:45.220
THAT'S, I THINK, WHERE THEY

13:45.240 --> 13:47.029
WOULD SAY THAT NEEDS TO BE

13:47.049 --> 13:49.179
RECTIFIED, IF IT COULD BE.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.240
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

13:50.259 --> 13:52.139
IT'S NOT TRUE.

13:52.159 --> 13:55.000
IT'S JUST NOT TRUE.

13:55.019 --> 13:55.230
THE CLAIM FROM THE TRUMP

13:55.250 --> 13:57.210
CAMPAIGN AND THE PRESIDENT ABOUT

13:57.230 --> 13:59.240
THAT IS NOT TRUE, IT IS FALSE.

13:59.259 --> 14:00.269
IN FACT, THE LAWYERS FOR THE

14:00.289 --> 14:02.289
TRUMP CAMPAIGN LAST NIGHT IN

14:03.009 --> 14:08.009
FEDERAL COURT ADMITTED THAT.

14:08.029 --> 14:08.179
>> John: HE'S RIGHT.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.090
THEY ADMITTED IT.

14:09.110 --> 14:10.000
SPECIFICALLY, THE JUDGE ASKED,

14:10.019 --> 14:15.220
"ARE PEOPLE REPRESENTING

14:15.240 --> 14:16.100
DONALD J. TRUMP IN THAT ROOM?"

14:16.120 --> 14:17.039
TO WHICH THE CAMPAIGN LAWYER

14:17.059 --> 14:17.200
SAID "YES," AND THE JUDGE

14:17.220 --> 14:18.090
REPLIED, "I'M SORRY, THEN WHAT'S

14:18.110 --> 14:18.240
YOUR PROBLEM?"

14:18.259 --> 14:19.250
MAKING THIS OFFICIALLY THE

14:19.269 --> 14:21.169
SINGLE SASSIEST WEEK IN THE

14:21.190 --> 14:23.070
HISTORY OF THE JUDICIARY.

14:23.090 --> 14:24.159
THEY MUST HAVE TRADED IN THEIR

14:24.179 --> 14:25.110
GAVELS FOR UMBRELLAS, BECAUSE

14:25.129 --> 14:26.100
THESE JURISTS ARE THROWING SOME

14:26.120 --> 14:29.039
SHADE.

14:29.059 --> 14:31.019
AND THE EMBARRASSING FLIMSINESS

14:31.039 --> 14:32.179
OF THESE FRAUD CLAIMS STARTS TO

14:32.200 --> 14:34.120
MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU SEE JUST HOW

14:34.139 --> 14:35.059
DESPERATELY THE TRUMP CAMP WAS

14:35.080 --> 14:36.120
TRYING TO DRUM THEM UP.

14:36.139 --> 14:37.230
TAKE ARIZONA.

14:37.250 --> 14:39.059
THEY ANNOUNCED AT A PRESS

14:39.080 --> 14:40.240
CONFERENCE ON THURSDAY THAT THEY

14:40.259 --> 14:41.149
HAD GATHERED "CONCERNS BY

14:41.169 --> 14:42.210
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE" ABOUT

14:42.230 --> 14:44.029
VOTING IRREGULARITIES.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.159
WHICH ON ITS FACE SOUNDS

14:45.179 --> 14:48.049
DRAMATIC.

14:48.070 --> 14:49.250
BUT IT'S ALSO A LITTLE AT ODDS

14:49.269 --> 14:51.000
WITH THIS MOMENT, CAPTURED JUST

14:51.019 --> 14:52.190
MINUTES EARLIER:

14:52.210 --> 14:54.179
>> HI, EVERYONE.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.019
IF ANYONE HAS ANY PERSONAL

14:56.039 --> 14:58.210
EXAMPLE WHERE THEY'VE WITNESSED

14:58.230 --> 15:00.039
ELECTION FRAUD HERE IN ARIZONA,

15:00.059 --> 15:02.049
PLEASE COME SEE ME.

15:02.070 --> 15:03.100
I NEED A CONCRETE EXAMPLE, I

15:03.120 --> 15:04.200
NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

15:04.220 --> 15:06.019
RIGHT OVER THERE IN THE CORNER,

15:06.039 --> 15:11.070
THANK YOU

15:11.090 --> 15:11.240
>> John: OKAY, THAT IS JUST

15:11.259 --> 15:12.149
PATHETIC.

15:12.169 --> 15:13.100
ALTHOUGH I DO LIKE THE IDEA THAT

15:13.120 --> 15:14.000
SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY WITNESSED

15:14.019 --> 15:16.139
ELECTION FRAUD AND HAD PROOF

15:16.159 --> 15:17.100
WAITING UNTIL THAT GLORIFIED

15:17.120 --> 15:18.009
BLOCK PARTY TO TELL ANYONE ABOUT

15:18.029 --> 15:28.240
IT.

15:28.259 --> 15:29.129
"YEAH, I SAW A GUY IN A SKI MASK

15:29.149 --> 15:30.220
PULLING FAKE BALLOTS OUT OF HIS

15:30.240 --> 15:31.110
KIA FESTIVA, BUT IT DIDN'T OCCUR

15:31.129 --> 15:31.289
TO ME TO TELL ANYONE ABOUT IT

15:32.009 --> 15:32.220
UNTIL A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE

15:32.240 --> 15:33.259
LAW FIRM HANGOVER, HANGOVER,

15:33.279 --> 15:34.159
DIVORCE & MEAT SWEATS TOLD ME TO

15:34.179 --> 15:36.070
MEET HIM OVER THERE IN THE

15:36.090 --> 15:39.100
CORNER.

15:39.120 --> 15:42.039
I'M SO GLAD I WAS WONDERING BY."

15:42.059 --> 15:43.129
BUT WAIT, THAT'S NOT ALL --

15:43.149 --> 15:44.169
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ALSO SET UP

15:44.190 --> 15:45.049
THIS WEBSITE AND PHONE NUMBER

15:45.070 --> 15:45.220
WHERE THEY INVITED PEOPLE TO

15:45.240 --> 15:46.120
SUBMIT EVIDENCE OF VOTER FRAUD,

15:46.139 --> 15:47.169
MEANING IF YOU, SAY, WANTED TO

15:47.190 --> 15:48.120
SUPPLY THEM WITH AN INCIDENT YOU

15:48.139 --> 15:49.039
FOUND SUSPICIOUS, YOU COULD DO

15:49.059 --> 15:50.019
THAT.

15:50.039 --> 15:51.190
YOU STILL CAN.

15:51.210 --> 15:52.269
YOU CAN SIMPLY GO TO THIS

15:52.289 --> 15:57.120
ADDRESS AND SEND THEM WHATEVER

15:57.139 --> 16:00.230
EVIDENCE YOU WANT.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.289
THERE'S EVEN AN OPTION TO ADD

16:02.009 --> 16:03.009
PHOTOGRAPHIC PROOF.

16:03.029 --> 16:03.269
QUICK FUN FACT, I DON'T KNOW WHY

16:03.289 --> 16:04.139
I'M EVEN MENTIONING THIS: A

16:04.159 --> 16:05.000
POLITICAL TERM OF ART FOR

16:05.019 --> 16:05.149
ELECTION SHENANIGANS IS

16:05.169 --> 16:06.159
RATFUCKING.

16:06.179 --> 16:09.230
SO IF YOU, SAY, HAPPEN TO HAVE

16:09.250 --> 16:12.000
ANY ACCESS TO IMAGES OF

16:12.019 --> 16:15.100
PENNSYLVANIA-BASED RATFUCKING,

16:15.120 --> 16:17.210
IT'S FRANKLY YOUR PATRIOTIC DUTY

16:17.230 --> 16:19.029
TO SEND THEM TO THE

16:19.049 --> 16:19.250
TRUMP CAMPAIGN STRAIGHT AWAY.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.159
AND ALL THESE POINTLESS LAWSUITS

16:21.179 --> 16:23.000
ARE CLEARLY GOING TO COST A LOT

16:23.019 --> 16:24.200
OF MONEY, WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY

16:24.220 --> 16:25.200
THE CAMPAIGN HAS SPENT THE LAST

16:25.220 --> 16:26.149
FEW DAYS FRANTICALLY TRYING TO

16:26.169 --> 16:28.039
FUNDRAISE FOR THEM, EMAILING

16:28.059 --> 16:29.259
SUPPORTERS IN AN INCREASINGLY

16:29.279 --> 16:31.230
AGGRESSIVE MANNER, WITH ONE

16:31.250 --> 16:32.159
MESSAGE READING, "THIS IS YOUR

16:32.179 --> 16:34.009
FINAL NOTICE.

16:34.029 --> 16:35.190
SO FAR, YOU'VE IGNORED ALL OUR

16:35.210 --> 16:37.049
EMAILS ASKING YOU TO JOIN US IN

16:37.070 --> 16:40.029
DEFENDING THE ELECTION.

16:40.049 --> 16:41.100
YOU'VE IGNORED TEAM TRUMP, ERIC,

16:41.120 --> 16:43.230
LARA, DON, THE VICE PRESIDENT,

16:43.250 --> 16:45.059
AND YOU'VE EVEN IGNORED THE

16:45.080 --> 16:48.179
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES."

16:48.200 --> 16:51.259
AND FINAL NOTICE FOR WHAT?

16:51.279 --> 16:53.029
TO NOT GIVE THEM MONEY?

16:53.049 --> 16:54.210
MAYBE IT'S THE LAST CHANCE

16:54.230 --> 16:55.289
TO GO TO THE OFFICIAL

16:56.009 --> 16:57.210
DONALD J. TRUMP SITE AND BUY

16:57.230 --> 16:59.090
THIS DOG LEASH FEATURING A DOG

16:59.110 --> 17:04.000
WHO I CAN ONLY ASSUME WAS

17:04.019 --> 17:06.230
LOBOTOMIZED AND GIVEN RABIES

17:06.250 --> 17:07.109
IMMEDIATELY BEFORE HAVING THIS

17:07.130 --> 17:07.220
PICTURE TAKEN.

17:07.240 --> 17:08.180
ALSO, QUICK SIDE NOTE ABOUT

17:08.200 --> 17:09.109
THOSE SOLICITATIONS:

17:09.130 --> 17:10.029
IN THE FINE PRINT, IT MENTIONS

17:10.049 --> 17:11.140
THAT, RATHER THAN FUNDING

17:11.160 --> 17:12.180
LAWSUITS, HALF OF ANY

17:12.200 --> 17:14.069
CONTRIBUTION WILL BE USED TO

17:14.089 --> 17:16.279
RETIRE DEBT FROM TRUMP'S

17:17.000 --> 17:18.180
RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS

17:18.200 --> 17:20.259
COMPLETELY UNSURPRISING, AND NOT

17:20.279 --> 17:21.289
EVEN THE WORST THING HE'S EVER

17:22.009 --> 17:23.190
ASKED HIS SUPPORTERS TO DO,

17:23.210 --> 17:24.230
BECAUSE THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE

17:24.250 --> 17:26.200
WHEN HE MADE THEM WATCH HIM DO

17:26.220 --> 17:28.059
THIS DANCE, WHICH LOOKS LIKE

17:28.079 --> 17:34.019
HE'S MILKING TWO COWS AT ONCE

17:34.039 --> 17:36.289
AND ENJOYING IT SEXUALLY

17:37.009 --> 17:38.009
VERY MUCH INDEED.

17:38.029 --> 17:39.079
BUT PERHAPS THE SINGLE MOST

17:39.099 --> 17:40.119
PATHETIC PART OF THIS ENTIRE

17:40.140 --> 17:40.289
WEEK WAS THAT IN THE MOMENTS

17:41.009 --> 17:42.009
BEFORE THIS RACE WAS CALLED ON

17:42.029 --> 17:42.200
SATURDAY MORNING, TRUMP TWEETED

17:42.220 --> 17:43.059
OUT "I WON THIS ELECTION,

17:43.079 --> 17:43.250
BY A LOT!" -- ALL CAPS,

17:43.269 --> 17:46.019
EXCLAMATION MARK.

17:46.039 --> 17:47.099
AND IF THAT WASN'T A BAD ENOUGH

17:47.119 --> 17:49.099
CASE OF DENIAL, THIS IS HOW SOME

17:49.119 --> 17:51.230
OF HIS SUPPORTERS RESPONDED TO

17:51.250 --> 17:55.079
NEWS OF HIS DEFEAT.

17:55.099 --> 17:56.150
>> ♪ WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS ♪

17:56.170 --> 18:00.009
♪ WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS♪

18:00.029 --> 18:02.079
♪ NO TIME FOR LOSERS ♪

18:02.099 --> 18:06.289
♪ 'CAUSE WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS ♪

18:07.009 --> 18:15.210
♪ OF THE WORLD ♪

18:15.230 --> 18:17.049
>> John: LOOK, I WOULD LOVE TO

18:17.069 --> 18:17.210
MAKE FUN OF THAT, BUT

18:17.230 --> 18:18.180
UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE

18:18.200 --> 18:20.079
NO TIME FOR LOSERS.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.220
BUT HERE'S THE REALLY IMPORTANT

18:21.240 --> 18:22.289
THING: AFTER THIS ABSOLUTE YEAR

18:23.009 --> 18:24.190
OF A WEEK -- THE DAYS OF

18:24.210 --> 18:26.109
COUNTING, THE MISINFORMATION,

18:26.130 --> 18:28.289
THE DESPERATE, PATHETIC ATTEMPTS

18:29.009 --> 18:30.079
TO PAINT THIS PROCESS AS

18:30.099 --> 18:31.150
FRAUDULENT -- THE FACT IS, TRUMP

18:31.170 --> 18:32.019
LOST THIS ELECTION.

18:32.039 --> 18:33.230
HE LOST.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.170
ALL THAT BULLSHIT WHICH WE'VE

18:35.190 --> 18:39.140
GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING WORK

18:39.160 --> 18:40.039
DID NOT WORK THIS TIME.

18:40.059 --> 18:41.130
AND IT'S NOT LIKE TRUMP AND HIS

18:41.150 --> 18:42.000
FAMILY ARE GOING TO STOP --

18:42.019 --> 18:42.240
THEY'RE GOING TO CARRY ON

18:42.259 --> 18:43.240
GRIFTING AND LYING LIKE THEY'VE

18:43.259 --> 18:47.000
ALWAYS DONE, BUT ONCE HE'S OUT

18:47.019 --> 18:48.089
OF THE WHITE HOUSE, IT'S JUST

18:48.109 --> 18:49.160
NOT GOING TO HAVE THE SAME

18:49.180 --> 18:50.019
EFFECT ANYMORE.

18:50.039 --> 18:51.029
IT'S NOT GOING TO DIRECTLY

18:51.049 --> 18:54.210
IMPACT EVERY AMERICAN'S LIFE.

18:54.230 --> 18:55.279
AND THAT ALONE IS FUCKING

18:56.000 --> 18:56.059
FANTASTIC.

18:56.079 --> 18:56.240
AND LOOK, BY TEMPERAMENT, I'M

18:56.259 --> 18:58.009
INCLINED TO OVER-ANALYZE

18:58.029 --> 18:59.079
EVERYTHING.

18:59.099 --> 19:02.200
AND I CAN ALREADY FEEL MYSELF

19:02.220 --> 19:04.029
STARTING TO DO IT, FOCUS ON THE

19:04.049 --> 19:04.210
NEGATIVES HERE AND BE CYNICAL

19:04.230 --> 19:05.190
ABOUT WHAT A BIDEN PRESIDENCY

19:05.210 --> 19:06.059
COULD -- OR IS EVEN GOING TO

19:06.079 --> 19:08.009
TRY -- TO ACHIEVE.

19:08.029 --> 19:10.140
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO ANYTHING

19:10.160 --> 19:12.200
NEGATIVE AT ALL, LET ME JUST

19:12.220 --> 19:13.279
GIVE US ALL A QUICK MOMENT, WITH

19:14.000 --> 19:16.009
NO CAVEATS, OF CELEBRATION.

19:16.029 --> 19:16.259
IN FACT, LET'S PUT 30 SECONDS ON

19:16.279 --> 19:18.130
THE CLOCK RIGHT NOW, DURING

19:18.150 --> 19:20.200
WHICH TIME EVERYONE CAN JUST

19:20.220 --> 19:22.089
EXPERIENCE JOY IN WHATEVER FORM

19:22.109 --> 19:24.140
YOU WANT -- DANCING, SCREAMING,

19:24.160 --> 19:25.119
BANGING A FRYING PAN -- IT'S UP

19:25.140 --> 19:26.269
TO YOU.

19:26.289 --> 19:29.009
PERSONALLY, I'M GOING TO DO ONE

19:29.029 --> 19:30.059
OF MY FAVORITE ACTIVITIES, WHICH

19:30.079 --> 19:31.130
IS DISPENSING EXCELLENT FACTS

19:31.150 --> 19:32.079
ABOUT OCTOPUSES OVER FOOTAGE OF

19:32.099 --> 19:32.269
PEOPLE CELEBRATING THIS

19:32.289 --> 19:33.279
ELECTION.

19:34.000 --> 19:34.279
READY:

19:35.000 --> 19:36.099
GO.

19:36.119 --> 19:38.089
OCTOPUSES ARE GREAT.

19:38.109 --> 19:39.279
THEY HAVE THREE HEARTS, BLUE

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
BLOOD, THEY CAN TASTE WITH THEIR

19:41.019 --> 19:42.109
ARMS, THEIR BRAINS ARE SPREAD

19:42.130 --> 19:43.259
THROUGHOUT THEIR BODY, THEY CAN

19:43.279 --> 19:45.000
CHANGE SHAPE AND COLOR, THEY

19:45.019 --> 19:46.089
HAVE BEAKS, THEY CAN OPEN

19:46.109 --> 19:47.200
BOTTLES, THEY REMEMBER FACES,

19:47.220 --> 19:49.049
AND THEY HOLD GRUDGES.

19:49.069 --> 19:50.069
ONE TIME AN OCTOPUS ESCAPED A

19:50.089 --> 19:51.160
NEW ZEALAND AQUARIUM BY CRAWLING

19:51.180 --> 19:52.259
DOWN A DRAIN PIPE INTO THE

19:52.279 --> 19:54.059
OCEAN.

19:54.079 --> 19:55.099
ALSO THERE WAS AN EXPERIMENT A

19:55.119 --> 19:57.089
FEW YEARS BACK WHERE SCIENTISTS

19:57.109 --> 19:58.200
GAVE OCTOPUSES ECSTASY, AND THEY

19:58.220 --> 20:00.029
LEARNED THAT IF OCTOPUSES TAKE

20:00.049 --> 20:01.000
ECSTASY, THEY'LL HANG OUT AND

20:01.019 --> 20:06.049
PARTY WITH OTHER OCTOPUSES, BUT

20:06.069 --> 20:07.210
IF YOU DON'T DO THAT, THEY

20:07.230 --> 20:08.089
PREFER TO KEEP TO THEMSELVES.

20:08.109 --> 20:08.250
THAT'S FROM A REAL STUDY.

20:08.269 --> 20:09.200
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

20:09.220 --> 20:10.089
I'M NOT SAYING I WANT TO FUCK AN

20:10.109 --> 20:13.019
OCTOPUS, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:13.039 --> 20:16.190
I KIND OF --

20:16.210 --> 20:17.220
OH, THAT'S IT.

20:17.240 --> 20:21.039
THAT'S TIME.

20:21.059 --> 20:22.089
THAT WAS UNCOMPLICATED FUN.

20:22.109 --> 20:23.049
SO NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND, I AM

20:23.069 --> 20:23.259
GOING TO OVER-ANALYZE THIS

20:23.279 --> 20:26.160
ELECTION JUST A LITTLE BIT.

20:26.180 --> 20:27.069
NOT MUCH THOUGH, MAINLY BECAUSE

20:27.089 --> 20:27.259
IT'S STILL TOO EARLY TO DRAW ANY

20:27.279 --> 20:28.180
BIG CONCLUSIONS.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.279
THERE ARE TWO KEY THINGS WE KNOW

20:30.000 --> 20:31.180
THOUGH.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.029
THE GREAT NEWS IS THAT THIS

20:33.049 --> 20:34.180
ELECTION HAD RECORD-BREAKING

20:34.200 --> 20:35.069
TURNOUT, AND OVER 74 MILLION

20:35.089 --> 20:36.089
PEOPLE CHOSE TO KICK

20:36.109 --> 20:39.029
DONALD TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE.

20:39.049 --> 20:40.230
THE LESS GOOD NEWS IS THAT MORE

20:40.250 --> 20:43.019
THAN 70 MILLION PEOPLE VOTED FOR

20:43.039 --> 20:44.079
HIM AND EVERYTHING HE'S SAID AND

20:44.099 --> 20:46.269
STANDS FOR, AND THAT'S SOMETHING

20:46.289 --> 20:48.130
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RECKON

20:48.150 --> 20:50.069
WITH FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

20:50.089 --> 20:54.009
AND I KNOW THAT BIDEN HAS

20:54.029 --> 20:54.200
REPEATEDLY SAID ON THE CAMPAIGN

20:54.220 --> 20:55.170
TRAIL THAT THE UGLINESS TRUMP

20:55.190 --> 20:57.039
REPRESENTS IS SIMPLY "NOT WHO WE

20:57.059 --> 20:58.210
ARE" -- HE DID IT CONSTANTLY IN

20:58.230 --> 21:00.140
MOMENTS LIKE THIS:

21:00.160 --> 21:01.180
>> THE ONLY THING THAT COULD

21:01.200 --> 21:02.279
TEAR AMERICA APART IS AMERICA

21:03.000 --> 21:04.029
ITSELF.

21:04.049 --> 21:06.240
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT TRUMP'S

21:06.259 --> 21:10.220
BEEN TRYING TO DO FROM THE VERY

21:10.240 --> 21:11.089
BEGINNING, DIVIDING AMERICA

21:11.109 --> 21:13.079
BASED ON RACE, RELIGION, GENDER,

21:13.099 --> 21:15.000
NATIONAL ORIGIN.

21:15.019 --> 21:16.140
IT'S WRONG.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.150
IT'S NOT WHO WE ARE.

21:18.170 --> 21:20.190
THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.

21:20.210 --> 21:22.109
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP

21:22.130 --> 21:23.150
IS.

21:23.170 --> 21:24.240
LET'S KEEP SHOWING THEM WHO WE

21:24.259 --> 21:30.140
ARE.

21:30.160 --> 21:32.109
>> John: LOOK, THAT IS A

21:32.130 --> 21:34.069
REALLY NICE SENTIMENT, BUT

21:34.089 --> 21:38.119
DIVIDING AMERICA BASED ON RACE,

21:38.140 --> 21:39.210
RELIGION, GENDER, AND

21:39.230 --> 21:40.039
NATIONAL ORIGIN HAS

21:40.059 --> 21:40.230
FREQUENTLY BEEN VERY MUCH WHO WE

21:40.250 --> 21:41.160
ARE.

21:41.180 --> 21:42.059
IN FACT, YOU COULD ARGUE THAT,

21:42.079 --> 21:43.079
IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA, THE

21:43.099 --> 21:43.269
ONE-SENTENCE VERSION OF TRUMP'S

21:43.289 --> 21:44.210
PRESIDENCY IS "HE KEPT SHOWING

21:44.230 --> 21:49.059
THEM WHO WE ARE."

21:49.079 --> 21:50.220
SO WE CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT

21:50.240 --> 21:51.210
IGNORE THAT MILLIONS VOTED FOR

21:51.230 --> 21:53.000
TRUMP, MEANING THEY EITHER

21:53.019 --> 21:54.099
ACTIVELY SUPPORTED HIS BIGOTRY,

21:54.119 --> 21:55.230
OR AT THE VERY LEAST, WERE

21:55.250 --> 21:56.220
COMFORTABLE ENOUGH WITH IT TO

21:56.240 --> 21:57.119
VOTE FOR HIM ANYWAY.

21:57.140 --> 21:58.160
WHICH ISN'T GREAT.

21:58.180 --> 22:00.029
IT'S LIKE IF YOUR GRANDMA WAS

22:00.049 --> 22:01.119
DATING TWO OLD GUYS, BOTH OF

22:01.140 --> 22:02.109
WHOM HAD FOUGHT IN WORLD WAR II,

22:02.130 --> 22:03.039
AND IN THE END, SHE PICKS PETE,

22:03.059 --> 22:04.240
WHO SEEMS DECENT AND WORKS AT

22:04.259 --> 22:05.259
THE LIBRARY AND YOU'RE HAPPY FOR

22:05.279 --> 22:07.160
HER.

22:07.180 --> 22:08.140
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU ARE

22:08.160 --> 22:10.130
WONDERING HOW THE FUCK SHE GOT

22:10.150 --> 22:12.079
SO FAR WITH KLAUS.

22:12.099 --> 22:13.109
BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T REALLY

22:13.130 --> 22:15.259
REFLECT THAT WELL ON HER.

22:15.279 --> 22:20.039
AND EVEN IN THE JOY AND RELIEF

22:20.059 --> 22:21.130
AT THE END OF THIS WEEK, IT DOES

22:21.150 --> 22:23.150
FEEL WORTH REMEMBERING HOW SCARY

22:23.170 --> 22:24.089
IT FELT AS IT HAPPENED, WITH

22:24.109 --> 22:25.130
TRUMP SUPPORTERS SWARMING AND

22:25.150 --> 22:27.079
FOLLOWING A BIDEN-HARRIS BUS IN

22:27.099 --> 22:30.220
TEXAS, AND THAT MOMENT IN

22:30.240 --> 22:32.049
DETROIT THAT WE SAW EARLIER,

22:32.069 --> 22:34.130
WHERE A LARGELY WHITE CROWD

22:34.150 --> 22:35.069
SHOWED UP IN A CITY THAT'S

22:35.089 --> 22:35.200
80% BLACK TO SHOUT

22:35.220 --> 22:36.099
THAT THEY SHOULD STOP COUNTING

22:36.119 --> 22:37.069
THEIR VOTES.

22:37.089 --> 22:38.210
AND IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

22:38.230 --> 22:39.190
THOSE IMAGES RHYME WITH HISTORY,

22:39.210 --> 22:40.160
IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST

22:40.180 --> 22:41.130
NOT BE USED TO SEEING THEM IN

22:41.150 --> 22:43.180
COLOR.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.059
BECAUSE THE LAST FOUR YEARS

22:45.079 --> 22:47.079
WEREN'T ABOUT JUST ONE MAN --

22:47.099 --> 22:48.019
AND THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE

22:48.039 --> 22:49.079
LAST FOUR YEARS.

22:49.099 --> 22:50.230
AND EVEN THAT ONE MAN IS BY NO

22:50.250 --> 22:54.130
MEANS GOING AWAY.

22:54.150 --> 22:56.180
>> WHATEVER HAPPENS,

22:56.200 --> 22:58.089
DONALD TRUMP IS THE CURRENT AND

22:58.109 --> 23:00.119
FUTURE LEADER OF THE REPUBLICAN

23:00.140 --> 23:01.109
PARTY.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.160
CERTAINLY AT LEAST UNTIL SOMEONE

23:02.180 --> 23:03.279
ELSE COMES ALONG WITH HIS

23:04.000 --> 23:05.240
STAMINA, CHARISMA, AND DRIVE.

23:05.259 --> 23:06.240
>> John: PUTTING ASIDE THE

23:06.259 --> 23:08.039
WILDLY DIVERGENT DEFINITIONS WE

23:08.059 --> 23:09.160
HAVE OF "STAMINA, CHARISMA,

23:09.180 --> 23:11.069
AND DRIVE," THAT "GET OUT"

23:11.089 --> 23:12.269
GARDEN PARTY GUEST IS RIGHT WHEN

23:12.289 --> 23:14.190
SHE SAYS DONALD TRUMP IS HERE TO

23:14.210 --> 23:17.019
STAY -- ALTHOUGH NOT IN OFFICE,

23:17.039 --> 23:18.240
HOWEVER HARD HE RESISTS GOING.

23:18.259 --> 23:19.279
AS A BIDEN CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON

23:20.000 --> 23:21.190
TOLD THE PRESS THIS WEEK,

23:21.210 --> 23:23.029
"THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

23:23.049 --> 23:24.250
IS PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF

23:24.269 --> 23:25.269
ESCORTING TRESPASSERS OUT OF THE

23:25.289 --> 23:28.099
WHITE HOUSE."

23:28.119 --> 23:29.079
WHICH IS JUST A NICE SENTENCE TO

23:29.099 --> 23:33.200
HEAR.

23:33.220 --> 23:34.200
AND THERE IS GOING TO BE TIME TO

23:34.220 --> 23:35.089
TALK ABOUT WHAT TRUMPISM IS

23:35.109 --> 23:35.289
GOING TO MEAN GOING FORWARD,

23:36.009 --> 23:36.269
JUST AS THERE'S GOING TO BE TIME

23:36.289 --> 23:38.000
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS WEEK

23:38.019 --> 23:40.210
MEANS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY,

23:40.230 --> 23:42.210
WHICH DIDN'T GET EVERYTHING THEY

23:42.230 --> 23:42.289
HOPED FOR.

23:43.009 --> 23:43.259
THEY LOST SEATS IN THE HOUSE,

23:43.279 --> 23:45.049
AND THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR

23:45.069 --> 23:46.190
NOT THEY'LL HAVE A SENATE

23:46.210 --> 23:47.279
MAJORITY IS DOWN TO TWO RUNOFF

23:48.000 --> 23:51.099
ELECTIONS IN GEORGIA IN JANUARY.

23:51.119 --> 23:52.180
BUT THE REAL TAKEAWAY OF THIS

23:52.200 --> 23:53.250
ELECTION IS THAT THERE'S NO EASY

23:53.269 --> 23:55.089
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF WHO WE

23:55.109 --> 24:01.150
ARE.

24:01.170 --> 24:03.049
A PERFECT EXAMPLE IS THIS:

24:03.069 --> 24:03.289
KAMALA HARRIS IS NOW GOING TO BE

24:04.009 --> 24:04.220
VICE PRESIDENT.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.009
THE FIRST WOMAN VICE PRESIDENT,

24:06.029 --> 24:06.200
THE FIRST SOUTH ASIAN AMERICAN

24:06.220 --> 24:07.250
VICE PRESIDENT, THE FIRST BLACK

24:07.269 --> 24:08.140
VICE PRESIDENT, AND THE SECOND

24:08.160 --> 24:09.289
BLACK PERSON WE'VE SENT TO THE

24:10.009 --> 24:12.190
WHITE HOUSE IN THE LAST 12

24:12.210 --> 24:14.220
YEARS.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.200
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

24:15.220 --> 24:16.119
UNFORTUNATELY, WE DID ELECT A

24:16.140 --> 24:18.049
WHITE SUPREMACIST IN BETWEEN

24:18.069 --> 24:18.210
THEM.

24:18.230 --> 24:19.250
AND THE FACT IS THAT ALL OF THAT

24:19.269 --> 24:22.279
TOGETHER IS KIND OF WHO WE ARE.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.190
WE'RE THE COUNTRY THAT DID ALL

24:24.210 --> 24:25.190
THOSE THINGS.

24:25.210 --> 24:30.099
AND IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO DENY

24:30.119 --> 24:30.289
THAT REALITY.

24:31.009 --> 24:32.109
AND JUST A FINAL QUICK POINT

24:32.130 --> 24:34.140
HERE: DEFEATING TRUMP TOOK A LOT

24:34.160 --> 24:36.000
OF WORK, MUCH OF IT BY ACTIVIST

24:36.019 --> 24:36.289
GROUPS LED BY THOSE WITH THE

24:37.009 --> 24:38.009
MOST TO LOSE FROM A SECOND TRUMP

24:38.029 --> 24:39.220
TERM.

24:39.240 --> 24:40.200
A BIG FACTOR IN THE VOTE IN

24:40.220 --> 24:42.000
ARIZONA WAS INDIGENOUS AND

24:42.019 --> 24:42.240
LATINO PEOPLE COMING OUT FOR

24:42.259 --> 24:44.279
BIDEN.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.230
AND IN PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN,

24:46.250 --> 24:48.019
AND GEORGIA, BLACK VOTERS WERE

24:48.039 --> 24:49.250
ABSOLUTELY KEY, WITH THE GROUPS

24:49.269 --> 24:51.059
ORGANIZING THAT VOTE,

24:51.079 --> 24:52.240
PARTICULARLY BLACK WOMEN,

24:52.259 --> 24:54.220
WORKING RELENTLESSLY FOR YEARS.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.200
AND IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD,

24:56.220 --> 24:58.119
THERE'S LIKELY TO BE A LOT OF

24:58.140 --> 25:00.240
TALK FROM WHITE PEOPLE ABOUT HOW

25:00.259 --> 25:01.210
BLACK AND BROWN VOTERS "SAVED

25:01.230 --> 25:03.289
US," WHICH KIND OF MISSES THE

25:04.009 --> 25:05.089
POINT A LITTLE BIT, BECAUSE THEY

25:05.109 --> 25:07.180
WEREN'T SO MUCH VOTING AS A

25:07.200 --> 25:09.130
FAVOR FOR WHITE PEOPLE SO MUCH

25:09.150 --> 25:10.130
AS VOTING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES

25:10.150 --> 25:11.109
AND THEIR COMMUNITIES FROM

25:11.130 --> 25:12.130
SOMEONE TRYING TO DO THEM ACTIVE

25:12.150 --> 25:15.180
HARM.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.170
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME LESSONS

25:16.190 --> 25:18.170
IN SOME OF THAT ORGANIZING.

25:18.190 --> 25:19.240
IN GEORGIA, STACEY ABRAMS, ALONG

25:19.259 --> 25:21.190
WITH MANY OTHERS, HELPED TO

25:21.210 --> 25:23.130
REGISTER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

25:23.150 --> 25:24.160
OF NEW VOTERS OVER THE PAST TWO

25:24.180 --> 25:25.259
YEARS -- HALF OF THEM PEOPLE OF

25:25.279 --> 25:28.160
COLOR -- AND TURN THEM OUT TO

25:28.180 --> 25:29.130
THE POLLS.

25:29.150 --> 25:30.230
IN FACT, JUST BEFORE THE

25:30.250 --> 25:32.130
PRESIDENTIAL RACE WAS CALLED,

25:32.150 --> 25:33.220
SHE WAS ALREADY TWEETING OUT

25:33.240 --> 25:34.250
DETAILS ABOUT THE JANUARY 5

25:34.269 --> 25:37.150
RUNOFF FOR SENATE AND MAKING

25:37.170 --> 25:38.250
SURE PEOPLE REQUEST THEIR

25:38.269 --> 25:39.039
BALLOTS.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.200
WHY?

25:40.220 --> 25:43.029
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S

25:43.049 --> 25:44.079
FUCKING DOING.

25:44.099 --> 25:45.279
AND IF THE DEMOCRATS

25:46.000 --> 25:47.140
ARE SMART -- WHICH THEY AREN'T

25:47.160 --> 25:48.130
ALWAYS -- THEY SHOULD LISTEN TO

25:48.150 --> 25:49.269
HER AND ACTIVISTS LIKE HER GOING

25:49.289 --> 25:52.089
FORWARD.

25:52.109 --> 25:53.259
LOOK, IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG

25:53.279 --> 25:55.000
ROAD TO DIG US OUT OF THE PLACE

25:55.019 --> 25:56.029
THAT THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAVE

25:56.049 --> 25:57.130
PUT US IN, BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S

25:57.150 --> 25:58.269
SO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THE

25:58.289 --> 26:00.220
MOMENTS OF TRIUMPH THIS WEEK HAS

26:00.240 --> 26:03.240
PROVIDED.

26:03.259 --> 26:05.059
RITCHIE TORRES AND

26:05.079 --> 26:07.029
MONDAIRE JONES BECAME

26:07.049 --> 26:07.220
THE FIRST GAY BLACK MEN ELECTED

26:07.240 --> 26:09.140
TO CONGRESS.

26:09.160 --> 26:11.109
CORI BUSH, A BLACK LIVES MATTER

26:11.130 --> 26:12.000
ACTIVIST, IS MISSOURI'S FIRST

26:12.019 --> 26:13.089
BLACK CONGRESSWOMAN.

26:13.109 --> 26:14.220
IN DELAWARE, SARAH McBRIDE

26:14.240 --> 26:16.049
BECAME THE COUNTRY'S FIRST

26:16.069 --> 26:17.039
OPENLY TRANSGENDER STATE

26:17.059 --> 26:19.250
SENATOR.

26:19.269 --> 26:21.069
MULTIPLE COUNTIES ELECTED

26:21.089 --> 26:22.000
REFORM-MINDED PROSECUTORS AND

26:22.019 --> 26:23.059
SHERIFFS.

26:23.079 --> 26:24.160
FLORIDA VOTED TO INCREASE THE

26:24.180 --> 26:25.269
MINIMUM WAGE, AND EVERY STATE

26:25.289 --> 26:27.089
THAT HAD A MARIJUANA INITIATIVE

26:27.109 --> 26:29.190
ON THE BALLOT APPROVED IT.

26:29.210 --> 26:31.220
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, DESPITE

26:31.240 --> 26:33.069
HIS LIES, HIS OBSTRUCTIONS, AND

26:33.089 --> 26:34.119
HIS DEPRESSINGLY POPULAR RACISM,

26:34.140 --> 26:38.269
THIS GUY FUCKING LOST.

26:38.289 --> 26:45.109
DO YOU REALIZE WHAT THAT MEANS?

26:45.130 --> 26:46.160
ONE, HE'S SAD RIGHT NOW -- WHICH

26:46.180 --> 26:47.059
IS GREAT.

26:47.079 --> 26:47.279
BUT ALSO, NO MORE STEPHEN MILLER

26:48.000 --> 26:48.220
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.049
NO MORE STEVE MNUCHIN -- HATE TO

26:50.069 --> 26:51.140
SEE HIM GO, LOVE TO WATCH

26:51.160 --> 26:52.029
HIM WALK AWAY.

26:52.049 --> 26:52.200
NO MORE HELICOPTER SHOUTING

26:52.220 --> 26:55.200
TIME.

26:55.220 --> 26:56.269
I'M NOT GOING TO MISS THAT.

26:56.289 --> 26:57.269
NO MORE MIKE PENCE OR

26:57.289 --> 26:59.089
BETSY DeVOS OR JARED.

26:59.109 --> 27:01.150
NO MORE FUCKING JARED.

27:01.170 --> 27:04.009
AND THERE'LL BE BIG SYSTEMIC,

27:04.029 --> 27:04.190
INSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS WE NEED

27:04.210 --> 27:06.160
TO TALK ABOUT IN THE MONTHS AND

27:06.180 --> 27:08.009
THE YEARS TO COME -- AND WE

27:08.029 --> 27:09.119
WILL, BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON,

27:09.140 --> 27:11.079
THIS IS THE LIFE I'VE CHOSEN.

27:11.099 --> 27:14.230
BUT FOR NOW, AFTER WHAT'S JUST

27:14.250 --> 27:16.049
HAPPENED, I FRANKLY THINK WE'VE

27:16.069 --> 27:17.250
ALL EARNED THE RIGHT TO PUT ON
