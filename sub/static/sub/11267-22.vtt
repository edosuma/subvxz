00:01.627 --> 00:04.588
Previously on 90210:
PJ has to get married
in two weeks,

00:04.588 --> 00:06.298
or he'll lose
all of this money.

00:06.298 --> 00:08.216
Sorry, Preston,
I can't marry you.

00:08.216 --> 00:10.051
I think you're the real talent,
and I think you should go solo.

00:10.051 --> 00:12.387
I can make that happen.
I'm in.
Yes, you are.

00:12.387 --> 00:13.514
About last night, that was...

00:13.514 --> 00:14.849
Something we are never, ever

00:14.849 --> 00:16.517
going to talk about
again, right?
Right.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.895
You and I belong together;
we can overcome anything.

00:19.895 --> 00:22.189
No. Can't do this. Stop.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.232
I know, but don't tell me

00:24.232 --> 00:27.110
that you don't have feelings,
because you and I both know

00:27.110 --> 00:28.529
that it's not true.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.531
CALEB: I haven't been
honest with you.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.742
I knew about your faith
and I knew you were going
into priesthood.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.202
And I knew
we couldn't be together.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.120
CALEB: I know you're
upset that Raj died,

00:37.120 --> 00:39.039
but getting yourself killed
because you're angry

00:39.039 --> 00:40.624
is not going to
bring him back.
You can't stop me

00:40.624 --> 00:42.250
from doing what
I'm going to do.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.127
And you can't watch over me
all the time. Nobody can.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.963
Ivy Sullivan, you
need to come with us.

00:45.963 --> 00:48.465
It's a warrant declaring you
to be a danger to yourself.

00:52.093 --> 00:54.555
Better luck
next time, Gloria.

00:56.640 --> 00:57.808
NAOMI: Ivy...

00:57.808 --> 00:59.768
we brought you
Do-Luxe doughnuts.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.687
ANNIE: They're your
favorite. (chuckles)

01:03.397 --> 01:04.772
Gee, guys,

01:04.772 --> 01:07.651
one bite of a doughnut,
and I'll probably

01:07.651 --> 01:09.653
totally forget that I'm
being held against my will

01:09.653 --> 01:13.240
in an insane asylum because
a crazy priest-in-training

01:13.240 --> 01:15.075
mistakenly assumed
that I was suicidal.

01:15.075 --> 01:18.203
Thank your boyfriend for me,
Annie. I'm having a blast here.

01:18.203 --> 01:21.373
Caleb isn't my boyfriend;
he was just worried about you.

01:21.373 --> 01:23.709
Look, Ivy, I've been
in this situation.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.920
They would have let you go
in, like, 24 hours

01:25.920 --> 01:27.379
if they didn't think
that you were

01:27.379 --> 01:29.464
actually a danger
to yourself.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.132
And the doctor said
you just sit

01:31.132 --> 01:33.052
with your arms crossed
and won't talk.

01:33.052 --> 01:35.387
You know what? Talking it out
might work for some people,

01:35.387 --> 01:36.931
but that's not going to
make me feel any better.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.432
Babe, they're not going
to let you go until

01:38.432 --> 01:39.892
you just tell them
what they want to hear.

01:39.892 --> 01:41.393
Nobody here gets it, guys.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.811
Okay, nobody understands
what I'm going through.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.772
And so talking about it
is not going to help.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.732
We just want you to come home.

01:46.732 --> 01:48.984
Can you just please tell us
what you want us to do?

01:48.984 --> 01:50.736
You know what you can do?

01:50.736 --> 01:52.279
You can just
leave me alone, guys.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.322
And stop bringing me things
like doughnuts, okay?

01:54.322 --> 01:56.533
'Cause I'm not, I'm not doing
it. I'm not baring my soul

01:56.533 --> 01:58.786
to they jerks, and I don't care
about the consequence.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.454
Okay? I don't care.
I'll just

02:00.454 --> 02:02.456
play checkers here for the rest
of my life if I have to.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.291
Gloria's actually
not bad competition

02:04.291 --> 02:06.919
when she doesn't think
she's the Queen of England.

02:09.964 --> 02:12.215
(sighs) That went well.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.759
She's so angry.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.970
I mean, I guess
I can't blame her.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.512
She's got a point.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.180
Bad things happen.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.976
You can be sad without
having a mental illness.

02:21.976 --> 02:24.144
Mmm. Speaking of
mental illness,

02:24.144 --> 02:26.438
you got to be insane not to
try one of these doughnuts.

02:26.438 --> 02:28.565
No, thanks.
I don't feel well.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.400
Sorry, it isn't a
cancer thing, is it?

02:30.400 --> 02:31.485
Naomi.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.736
I'm really glad I told you guys

02:32.736 --> 02:33.988
about my cancer gene.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.739
Made me take my mind
right off of it.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.783
Oh, Sil,
I'm sorry.
I'm kidding, it's just...

02:37.783 --> 02:40.535
I have my first mammogram today,
and...

02:40.535 --> 02:41.829
you know, it's a routine thing

02:41.829 --> 02:43.538
now that I know
I'm at high risk,

02:43.538 --> 02:46.000
but I'm a little nervous.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.668
You want us to
go with you?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.711
No, thanks. Navid's taking me.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.379
Oh, he's such a good guy.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.882
I know you guys have had
your fair share of drama, but

02:53.882 --> 02:56.384
I'm really glad to see you
back together and happy.

02:56.384 --> 02:59.220
Yeah, I'm a lucky girl.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.981
(doorknob jiggling)

03:14.862 --> 03:16.822
Ah!
(sighs)

03:16.822 --> 03:18.406
Doesn't anybody knock anymore?!

03:18.406 --> 03:19.741
Okay, I'm sorry,
the lock's broken.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.327
I didn't think anyone
would be in here.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.662
What, could have been murdered

03:23.662 --> 03:25.956
by a stoned surfer
for my bowl of cereal.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.249
I think you're going
to live. (chuckles)

03:28.249 --> 03:30.544
Um, okay, I just came here
to get my lucky shoes

03:30.544 --> 03:32.963
because I think I forgot them
when I packed up my things.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.548
Oh, of course.
Uh, be my guest.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.799
Cool.

03:37.092 --> 03:40.428
So, uh, breakups, man, huh?

03:40.428 --> 03:42.263
They are the worst.

03:42.263 --> 03:45.059
But you look like you're dealing
with it, all dressed up.

03:45.059 --> 03:47.352
Ready to meet a new guy?
(chuckles)

03:47.352 --> 03:50.480
Wait, Ade, are you trying
to meet a new guy?

03:50.480 --> 03:52.357
(sighs)
Because if that's the case,

03:52.357 --> 03:54.109
I really think you should
give Dixon a second chance.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.904
No, I'm meeting Austin,
my new manager.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.947
He hooked us up
with a really huge meeting.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.407
Oh, great.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.825
That sounds cool.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.577
Okay.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.204
Navid, what is it?

04:05.204 --> 04:07.414
Look, I know that
you guys had a fight,

04:07.414 --> 04:08.665
but he's a good person.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.291
Look, and he's been
helping me a lot.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.169
Ade, do you ever
think that just maybe

04:12.169 --> 04:13.587
he might be helping himself?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.547
What's that
supposed to mean?

04:15.547 --> 04:17.882
I know, I'm sorry that I jumped
to conclusions at Naomi's party.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.968
I-I just...
I don't trust him.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.970
Behind that cheesy country grin
and that oddly fit torso

04:21.970 --> 04:24.139
is a guy that burned
down a house and tried

04:24.139 --> 04:25.432
to frame his roommate for it.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.101
All right, he panicked,
but at the end,

04:27.101 --> 04:28.852
he ended up
doing the right thing.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.730
So, you're giving him
a second chance, but not Dixon?

04:33.314 --> 04:36.235
Hey, just do me a favor:

04:36.235 --> 04:39.196
Make sure he's looking out
for you and not himself.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.073
Yeah.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.370
Great. Now it's mushy.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.623
NAOMI: Why can't all guys
be like Navid?

04:49.623 --> 04:52.333
I mean, seriously, why did I
have to fall in love with a

04:52.333 --> 04:54.586
dysfunctional billionaire?
Huh!

04:54.586 --> 04:56.755
You're asking the girl
who fell for a priest.

04:56.755 --> 04:58.673
Oh, right.
Please don't tell me

04:58.673 --> 05:01.135
you're still friends
without benefits.
Mm-hmm.

05:01.135 --> 05:02.636
How is that possible?
Didn't you have that

05:02.636 --> 05:04.471
amazing kiss
after my engagement party?

05:04.471 --> 05:07.474
Yes, and it was one of the top
three kisses of my entire life.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.810
But ever since then, not
even a peck on the cheek.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.229
Okay, well, then you just
jump his bones already.

05:12.229 --> 05:14.731
I can't, he's been
planning on being

05:14.731 --> 05:16.524
a priest his whole life.
It's not exactly

05:16.524 --> 05:18.359
like switching majors.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.654
And after that kiss, we agreed
that we wouldn't do it again

05:20.654 --> 05:21.905
until he knew he was ready.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.364
So, what do you do all day?

05:23.364 --> 05:24.616
Just sit around
and play checkers

05:24.616 --> 05:26.118
like Ivy and
the Queen of England?

05:26.118 --> 05:28.578
Well, we don't trust ourselves
in private.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.956
So, we hang out in public
to avoid temptation.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.500
Oh, right, because people don't
have sex in public places.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.710
(sighs)
Seriously, you must
have loins of steel.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.879
I could never deal with that
kind of sexual frustration.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.631
Yes! Yes! Okay?!

05:39.631 --> 05:42.092
My loins are very,
very frustrated.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.469
But, you know, it's kind
of romantic in a way.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.513
I don't know, we
have another date

05:46.513 --> 05:48.682
this afternoon at
the La Brea Tar Pit.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.101
Ah, that's easy.
I know five places

05:51.101 --> 05:52.602
at the tar pits
you can have sex.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.188
Ugh.
Okay, fine.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.606
Enjoy your old-fashioned
courtship and your cold showers.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.567
As for me, I am going to
keep my mind off of PJ

05:59.567 --> 06:02.570
by having a meeting
this afternoon with

06:02.570 --> 06:04.656
a potential client,
Madison Stewart.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.700
The cosmetics heiress?!
That's great!
Mm-hmm.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.077
I almost forgot you
were a party planner.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.620
Business kind of
took a back burner

06:10.620 --> 06:12.706
to my whirlwind romance,
but I am back, baby.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.792
It's going to help me forget all
about the fact that last week

06:15.792 --> 06:19.171
I was engaged and this week,
I'm not.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.631
♪ ♪

06:21.631 --> 06:24.467
Mm, eat your heart
out, Brad Pitt.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.345
Man, I feel like an idiot.

06:26.345 --> 06:28.513
Well, strap in, because
your life is going to be

06:28.513 --> 06:30.557
completely crazy after your
premiere tomorrow night, okay?

06:30.557 --> 06:31.725
Here.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.601
I want you to have these.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.854
What are these, like your good
luck cufflinks or something?

06:35.854 --> 06:38.690
No, but I did look pretty
great at last year's prom.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.275
(chuckles)
Just saying.

06:40.275 --> 06:44.696
Hey, I wanted to ask you
for your advice about Silver.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.740
I wanted to apologize
for not being there

06:46.740 --> 06:48.825
for all the gene
testing stuff.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.369
I'm glad you stepped up.

06:50.369 --> 06:52.329
You're a good friend.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.664
Yeah, thanks.
I'm just freaking out
a little bit.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.958
I have to take her to an
appointment this morning,

06:56.958 --> 06:59.586
and I'm afraid I'm going to say
something stupid, you know?

06:59.586 --> 07:00.921
You don't really
have to say anything.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.173
Just... just be
there for her.

07:03.173 --> 07:04.674
Yeah, thanks, man.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.843
Why is it so hard to be
the strong and silent type?

07:06.843 --> 07:08.803
Sometimes I think it would
be better for Silver

07:08.803 --> 07:10.347
if I took your advice:

07:10.347 --> 07:12.974
left for Princeton and let you
help her deal with this.

07:12.974 --> 07:15.476
It'll be fine.

07:15.476 --> 07:18.188
Got to get out of here. Hate
to keep you from your manicure

07:18.188 --> 07:19.981
or your chest wax,

07:19.981 --> 07:21.691
but, uh,
I will see you soon.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.403
Okay, you joke, but seriously,
I'm in hell right now.

07:24.403 --> 07:27.572
NAVID: I know.
I'm sorry, bro. You look good.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.747
Madison, may I
top off your bubbly?

07:35.747 --> 07:38.333
A second glass
this early in the day?
(chuckles)

07:38.333 --> 07:40.877
Oh, foo, why not?
Let's be naughty.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.297
You are such a
breath of fresh air, Naomi.

07:43.297 --> 07:47.092
You have no idea. I am so sick
of stuffy old party planners.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.844
Well, thank you. Some
people see me and assume

07:49.844 --> 07:51.763
I'm inexperienced,

07:51.763 --> 07:55.058
but I like to look at
my youth as an asset.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.644
I think we're going to have
a lot of fun working together.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.562
I was so thrilled when I
found out you were available.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.065
Yeah, as luck would have it,

08:02.065 --> 08:06.153
I had an engagement that
was called off last minute.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.488
Well, isn't that lucky?
Hm.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.324
All right, what can
I help you with?

08:10.324 --> 08:11.825
Birthday party, graduation?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.452
I am getting married!

08:13.452 --> 08:16.704
(squeals)
Oh.
Um...

08:16.704 --> 08:18.290
That is so great for you.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.125
Would you like
some more of this?

08:20.125 --> 08:21.293
Oh, I'm...

08:21.293 --> 08:22.836
There you go. (chuckles)

08:22.836 --> 08:25.088
So happy for you.
It's going to be great.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.548
Oh! A toast.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.217
Whoo!

08:36.224 --> 08:38.226
Hey...

08:39.269 --> 08:41.020
I am so nauseous.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.857
Oh, I'm sorry. My mom gave me
this cologne for Hanukah,

08:43.857 --> 08:45.733
and (chuckles) it smells
like a rental car.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.819
It's not your cologne.
(chuckles)
Yeah?

08:47.819 --> 08:50.571
It's, um, I think I'm just
nervous about the mammogram.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.240
Hey, for what it's worth,

08:52.240 --> 08:53.825
I hear it's painless.

08:53.825 --> 08:56.244
And not that I would want to
put my boobs in a machine.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.455
(chuckles)
Not that I have boobs.

08:58.455 --> 09:02.042
Oh, yeah, this is exactly
how Liam told me not to act.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.336
When did you see Liam?

09:04.336 --> 09:06.004
This morning.
I wanted his advice,

09:06.004 --> 09:07.547
because he went with
you to the doctor's,

09:07.547 --> 09:09.132
and he was
helpful and quiet.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.009
Now you're stuck with
a Persian Woody Allen.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.178
(chuckles)
Sorry.

09:15.347 --> 09:17.098
Erin Silver?
Yeah, that's her.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.684
I guess you could
figure that one out.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.644
I just have a few
standard questions

09:21.644 --> 09:23.646
before we begin
the procedure.
Okay.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.274
Do you abuse alcohol,
tobacco or caffeine?

09:26.274 --> 09:28.609
I really love tea;
I don't know if that matters.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.278
Yeah, she's obsessed with it.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.780
She acts like a meth head
about to have her Earl Grey.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.324
I have other patients waiting.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.950
Oh, uh, sorry. Uh, please.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.786
Is there any possibility
you could be pregnant?

09:38.786 --> 09:41.873
Oh, no, that's not an issue.
Um, we're very responsible.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.215
Silver?

09:52.800 --> 09:55.887
(theme music playing)

10:08.358 --> 10:10.902
I don't get it. How
could you be pregnant?

10:10.902 --> 10:12.862
I mean, we just
got back together,

10:12.862 --> 10:14.531
and it's been a while since you
broke up with that Greg creep.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.907
He wasn't a creep.
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:15.907 --> 10:17.909
It's been a while
since you broke up

10:17.909 --> 10:19.327
with that amazing
Greg guy.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.455
Silver, I'm not mad. I just...

10:21.455 --> 10:24.458
I feel like I deserve
an explanation.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.585
There was someone else.

10:26.585 --> 10:28.878
Um, it doesn't matter who it was

10:28.878 --> 10:31.298
because he's not in my life.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.757
It's just a random hookup.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.551
You mean, you slept
with a stranger?

10:34.551 --> 10:37.304
I was freaked out
and vulnerable, and it happened.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.722
Now, you might be pregnant
with some random guy's baby.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.141
We don't know that for sure,
okay?

10:41.141 --> 10:43.059
I got to go back to the doctor
tomorrow.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.770
Can't we just go to the drug-
store now and pee on a stick?

10:45.770 --> 10:47.939
No, 'cause then I'd have
to still go to the doctor,

10:47.939 --> 10:49.899
have it confirmed, and
I've just been through

10:49.899 --> 10:52.777
too much uncertainty lately
to go through it again.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.488
Okay, look.
Let's just stay calm

10:54.488 --> 10:56.281
until we find out
the results, okay?

10:56.281 --> 11:00.619
There's no reason to freak out
until we know for sure. Okay?

11:00.619 --> 11:02.787
CALEB: The fake mammoths
are a little cheesy,

11:02.787 --> 11:05.081
but this is still one of
my favorite places in L.A.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.292
Yeah, me, too. And
you know what's crazy?

11:07.292 --> 11:09.461
These mammoths knew how
dangerous the tar pits were,

11:09.461 --> 11:11.796
but every once in a while,
they just get so thirsty

11:11.796 --> 11:13.298
that they couldn't
help themselves.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.799
And then they'd get stuck.

11:14.799 --> 11:18.428
I guess, sometimes you
want something so bad,

11:18.428 --> 11:20.138
you don't care about
the consequences.

11:20.138 --> 11:23.642
I was going to go in a
completely different direction

11:23.642 --> 11:27.270
with the whole mammoth metaphor,
but that works, too, yeah.

11:33.568 --> 11:34.861
ADRIANNA: We're on time.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.446
(chuckles) Believe me,
I will never be late

11:36.446 --> 11:38.532
to another meeting
ever again.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.783
Well, for some people, being
on time just isn't enough.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.452
Okay, well, are you
going to finally tell me

11:42.452 --> 11:45.330
who this meeting is with?
The suspense is killing me.

11:47.999 --> 11:50.460
Your dad?
Uh-huh.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.760
Hey.
Well...

11:59.760 --> 12:01.929
look who just rolled out of bed
at the crack of noon.

12:01.929 --> 12:05.392
And you must be what my son
considers "getting a job."

12:05.392 --> 12:06.893
(chuckles) Hi.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.645
AUSTIN: Dad,
this is Adrianna, my client.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.980
Country music's
next rising star.

12:10.980 --> 12:14.775
Oh, this is so exciting.
I am such a huge fan.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.445
Well, honey, you're as pretty
as a prayer book.
(chuckles)

12:17.445 --> 12:19.780
But pretty sells
magazines, not records.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.409
Well, Dad, they stopped calling
them records about 20 years ago.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.619
And, uh, Ade here's
got real talent.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.745
Well, if she's got talent,
she's got you.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.122
What do you need me for?

12:28.122 --> 12:29.916
A premiere venue.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.669
Listen, I've been talking her up
to everybody in Nashville, okay?

12:32.669 --> 12:34.170
But one song
at one of your shows

12:34.170 --> 12:36.130
is all I need to take her
straight the top.

12:36.130 --> 12:39.676
Son, a Judd Ridge show
is not open mic night.
Yeah.

12:39.676 --> 12:42.303
Now, honey, I've heard you
sing. I've heard your demos.

12:42.303 --> 12:45.473
You're good, but if
you're not ready for this,

12:45.473 --> 12:47.766
it's your butt hanging
out there, not his.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.852
Now, do you honestly
think you can stand

12:49.852 --> 12:52.564
in front of thousands of
my fans and win them over?

12:52.564 --> 12:54.107
'Cause I'm going to
be honest with you.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.900
You look a whole lot
more country club

12:55.900 --> 12:57.569
than you do country star.

12:57.569 --> 13:00.071
Oh, well, I...
Dad, Ade's not
from Beverly Hills.

13:00.071 --> 13:02.323
Yeah, she's been singing
country music her whole life.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.617
Hell, it's in her blood.

13:05.201 --> 13:09.497
Well, in that case, I got a
little show tomorrow night.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.124
I think she'll fit right in.

13:13.918 --> 13:16.379
I'll give your manager
all the details.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.095
Country is in my blood?
Wha...

13:24.095 --> 13:27.641
Why did you have
to lie like that?
Because I'm your manager.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.976
Trust me.

13:40.445 --> 13:43.822
Caleb Walsh,
is that you?

13:43.822 --> 13:46.409
Sister Mary-Katherine,
how nice to see you.

13:46.409 --> 13:48.869
Sister Mary, this is,
uh, Annie Wilson.

13:48.869 --> 13:52.248
She's a friend from CU.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.750
Lovely to meet you.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.252
You as well.

13:56.252 --> 13:59.422
Well, I must be going; I'll
see you at Mass this Sunday.

14:00.214 --> 14:02.133
(uneasy chuckle)

14:04.427 --> 14:07.472
Okay, so that was
sufficiently awkward.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.683
Caleb, we... we can't
keep going on like this.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.851
It's just too hard. I mean,
what are we supposed to do?

14:15.062 --> 14:16.773
I have to make a decision.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.114
ANNIE: (sighs) Okay,

14:25.114 --> 14:28.159
since when do nuns hang out
at La Brea Tar Pits?

14:28.159 --> 14:30.787
Ugh, no clue. Are they even
allowed to believe in dinosaurs?

14:30.787 --> 14:33.039
You know, because of the
whole Noah's Ark thing.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.833
Good question. I'll
be sure to ask Caleb

14:34.833 --> 14:37.377
if I ever see him again.
Oh...

14:37.377 --> 14:41.381
Oh, no, okay. Uh, if I see
you in a wedding gown,

14:41.381 --> 14:43.550
you're going to become Ivy's
new mental hospital roommate.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.260
Relax. I have not lost my mind.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.679
Well, maybe I have.

14:47.679 --> 14:50.181
I agreed to plan Madison
Stewart's wedding.

14:50.181 --> 14:51.725
After the whole PJ thing?

14:51.725 --> 14:53.226
Are you sure
you can handle that right now?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.144
I'm going to keep my emotions
out of it

14:55.144 --> 14:57.522
and just get the job done.
Surgical.

14:57.522 --> 14:58.565
Like an assassin.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.483
(doorbell rings)
Hmm.

15:00.483 --> 15:02.819
Oh, Diego, hi.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.945
Ivy hasn't been
returning my calls.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.156
Come in.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.325
DIEGO: Look, I know that
she's been going through

15:09.325 --> 15:12.328
and awful lot. Um, I just,
I got to talk to her,

15:12.328 --> 15:16.123
see how she's
doing. Can you
get her for me?

15:16.123 --> 15:18.251
Uh...

15:18.251 --> 15:21.629
Okay, Ivy didn't want us
to tell you this,

15:21.629 --> 15:24.298
but she's... not here.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.050
Where is she?
Is she okay?

15:26.050 --> 15:28.845
There were some people
who were concerned

15:28.845 --> 15:32.807
about what she might
do, and... she was

15:32.807 --> 15:34.809
put into a hospital
for observation.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.436
What do you mean,
like a mental hospital?

15:36.436 --> 15:38.563
Oh, she's fine. She's
fine. She's just mad.

15:38.563 --> 15:40.648
DIEGO: What?
Well, not, not like
that kind of mad.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.400
Like angry mad.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.111
She doesn't think the doctors
at Beverly Hills Psychiatric

15:45.111 --> 15:47.739
are helping.
She won't listen to us.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.990
Maybe you could
talk to her.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.788
Talking's not what
she needs right now.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.930
Hey...

16:11.930 --> 16:15.642
Mm. Hey, I'm... I'm
not going to lie, okay?

16:15.642 --> 16:16.851
I've been trying
in the past hour

16:16.851 --> 16:18.102
not to freak out
in front of Silver,

16:18.102 --> 16:20.647
and I could really
use a drink.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.608
Silver okay?
Mm.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.902
Did something turn up
on the mammogram?

16:25.902 --> 16:29.489
Oh, she didn't even take
the mammogram.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.824
Oh, why?

16:30.824 --> 16:32.325
'Cause they don't let you

16:32.325 --> 16:34.327
if you might be pregnant.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.745
Yeah.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.204
What?

16:37.204 --> 16:39.833
Mm. Oh, she said
it was a random hookup,

16:39.833 --> 16:42.042
it didn't mean anything.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.544
Well... (laughs)

16:43.544 --> 16:46.923
Oh, I guess it does now, right?

16:56.891 --> 17:00.436
Naomi, how did you come up
with all this so fast?

17:00.436 --> 17:02.856
It's almost as if
you've had this wedding planned

17:02.856 --> 17:04.315
before we even met.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.442
Yeah. Well, I'm
just that good.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.819
Okay, what are you
thinking for napkins?

17:08.819 --> 17:11.196
Um, deep forest
green, teal?

17:11.196 --> 17:12.824
Naomi, come on!

17:12.824 --> 17:15.785
It doesn't have to be
all work talk all the time.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.578
Well, I'm just doing my job.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.454
Keeping my eye on the prize.

17:19.454 --> 17:20.665
Flowers.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.500
You remind me
of my fiancé.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.292
He's an entrepreneur, too.

17:24.292 --> 17:27.296
I love him to pieces,
but sometimes,

17:27.296 --> 17:29.298
it's, like, "Hello!
Anybody in there?"

17:29.298 --> 17:31.300
He's so focused on work.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.011
Ugh! He's so cute.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.596
I just want to chop him up into
little pieces and eat him up.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.139
Oh, well, will
you let me know

17:37.139 --> 17:39.308
if you do that before
I hire the band?

17:39.308 --> 17:41.519
Naomi,

17:41.519 --> 17:44.939
everything you've shown me
has been so perfect,

17:44.939 --> 17:46.566
so personal, but

17:46.566 --> 17:48.150
I'm not really sure
about the venue.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.069
What's wrong with
Bel Air Villa?

17:50.069 --> 17:52.405
I mean, it's-it's
big, it's beautiful,

17:52.405 --> 17:54.574
it has priceless
art everywhere...

17:54.574 --> 17:56.492
Yeah, but so does my house.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.285
I was hoping for something

17:58.285 --> 18:00.287
super romantic, some place

18:00.287 --> 18:02.373
truly special.
Okay.

18:02.373 --> 18:04.792
An unforgettable spot
where I can stand

18:04.792 --> 18:06.293
with my fiancé
and take our vows

18:06.293 --> 18:08.254
and face the future, and know

18:08.254 --> 18:11.424
that we're going to be together
for the rest of our lives.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.634
Um...

18:13.634 --> 18:15.970
that sounds really nice,
Madison.

18:15.970 --> 18:19.181
I'm in love, Naomi.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.517
If it were your wedding,

18:21.517 --> 18:24.144
where would you want
to get married?

18:24.144 --> 18:26.480
Um...

18:27.690 --> 18:30.735
Okay... there is a place.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.528
(laughs)

18:38.325 --> 18:39.660
(beeps, lock buzzes)

18:49.503 --> 18:50.964
Who told you I was here?

18:50.964 --> 18:52.840
Your friends want me
to convince you to cooperate,

18:52.840 --> 18:54.759
so the doctor will sign
your release papers.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.385
Yeah, well, that's
not gonna happen.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.929
I know that...

18:57.929 --> 19:01.099
'cause we're getting you
the hell out of here.

20:08.457 --> 20:09.583
Ow!
Whoo!

20:09.583 --> 20:10.877
Good job, everybody!

20:10.877 --> 20:11.961
We'll see you
at the show tonight.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.420
Sounds great, guys.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.421
That was a good set.

20:14.421 --> 20:15.506
That was amazing.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.175
That was just
a sound check.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.593
Kinda gotta save my pipes
for the big show tonight.

20:19.593 --> 20:20.636
(chuckling)

20:20.636 --> 20:21.762
Oh, come on.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.139
Don't let this old man
fool you.

20:23.139 --> 20:24.557
My dad gives 100%

20:24.557 --> 20:27.768
if the only person listening
is a deaf jazz fan.

20:27.768 --> 20:30.063
Well, honey, tonight,
it's gonna take 200%.

20:30.063 --> 20:32.481
Half of Nashville's
gonna be watching.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.317
She's more than
ready, Dad.

20:35.317 --> 20:38.821
Well, I guess we're gonna
find out, ain't we?

20:38.821 --> 20:40.031
Mm-hmm.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.323
Tell you what-- I'll
see you later.

20:41.323 --> 20:44.077
Me and... a few thousand
other people.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.870
I can't wait.
See you, Dad.

20:50.208 --> 20:51.625
Hey...

20:51.625 --> 20:53.753
Come on.
Don't let him rattle you.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.837
All right?

20:54.837 --> 20:56.047
You're gonna be great.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.256
I mean, you've
performed in front of

20:57.256 --> 20:58.216
bigger crowds than this.

20:58.216 --> 20:59.759
Yeah, crowds of teenagers.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.385
I've never sung a
country song

21:01.385 --> 21:03.179
in front of half of
Nashville before.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.098
What if fall flat
on my face?
You won't.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.473
You only get one
second chance, Austin.

21:06.473 --> 21:07.808
This is mine.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.560
Look, you know, what if
your dad was right?

21:09.560 --> 21:10.811
If I'm not ready,

21:10.811 --> 21:12.312
this is my career
on the line.

21:12.312 --> 21:14.523
Hey, you're not gonna
chicken out, okay?

21:14.523 --> 21:15.858
This is already a done deal,

21:15.858 --> 21:18.236
and I am not failing in
front of him again.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.614
Wow, you sound
just like Dixon.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.074
Putting your career
in front of me?

21:23.074 --> 21:24.324
Hey, I am not like Dixon.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.660
Yeah, maybe you're
even worse, okay?

21:26.660 --> 21:28.913
'Cause even Dixon
wouldn't burn down a house

21:28.913 --> 21:30.539
and frame his roommate
for it.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.416
Hey...

21:32.416 --> 21:34.668
I had to do what I had to do
to protect someone, okay?

21:34.668 --> 21:36.462
There's a lot more to that story
that you don't know.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.215
Okay, I don't know
anything anymore.

21:39.215 --> 21:42.426
Except that maybe working
with you was a huge mistake.

21:42.426 --> 21:43.677
I gotta go.

21:43.677 --> 21:44.762
Hey!

21:46.889 --> 21:48.766
Hey!

21:51.144 --> 21:53.187
MADISON: Oh... my God.

21:53.187 --> 21:56.690
It's the perfect wedding spot!

21:56.690 --> 21:58.484
Oh, I've dreamed of
getting married here

21:58.484 --> 22:00.236
ever since I was
a little girl.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.404
How is this available
on such short notice?

22:02.404 --> 22:05.783
Uh, last-minute
cancelation.

22:10.204 --> 22:13.540
Okay, try to picture it:
the music, the breeze,

22:13.540 --> 22:16.002
the sun is shining
through the trees,

22:16.002 --> 22:20.673
and you're standing across
from the man you love and...

22:20.673 --> 22:24.093
thought you were gonna spend
the rest of your life with.

22:24.093 --> 22:26.804
It's gonna be
like a dream.

22:26.804 --> 22:28.346
I even have
the dress picked out.

22:28.346 --> 22:29.682
It's perfect.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.600
I saw it this morning.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.437
Of course, we'll have
to make some adjustments,

22:35.437 --> 22:38.316
because I'm not as totally
perfect as that girl,

22:38.316 --> 22:40.234
'cause we can't all
be supermodels.

22:43.863 --> 22:48.701
Um... PJ Hillingsbrook
got married?

22:48.701 --> 22:50.203
Yeah. Lucky girl.

22:50.203 --> 22:52.454
He's the most eligible bachelor
in Beverly Hills.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.332
Do you know him?

22:55.082 --> 22:56.542
Okay, two weeks ago,

22:56.542 --> 22:58.878
I thought Preston was the love
of my life.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.338
We were gonna get married here.

23:00.338 --> 23:01.839
I was dumb enough to think

23:01.839 --> 23:04.050
that he could love me
more than his money.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.802
Oh, my God.
Naomi, are you okay?

23:11.140 --> 23:15.435
No, no, I am not okay!

23:15.435 --> 23:17.646
Everything he said
to me was a lie!

23:17.646 --> 23:19.273
I was a fool

23:19.273 --> 23:21.734
because I believed that...

23:21.734 --> 23:26.739
that love like this
instant, real, lasting love

23:26.739 --> 23:27.865
would actually exist.

23:27.865 --> 23:30.492
And you know what?
It doesn't!

23:30.492 --> 23:31.827
It doesn't exist.

23:31.827 --> 23:35.039
So if you want to get married,
go ahead,

23:35.039 --> 23:38.500
but do not say
that I didn't warn you.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.344
(footsteps approach)

23:48.344 --> 23:51.138
ANNIE: Are you okay?

23:51.138 --> 23:53.807
And do you really think
that you're gonna be up

23:53.807 --> 23:55.559
to going
to Liam's movie premiere?

23:55.559 --> 23:57.978
Of course. I'm fine.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.437
(sighs)

24:00.898 --> 24:02.275
What a joke.

24:02.275 --> 24:03.984
(laughs)

24:03.984 --> 24:05.861
The guy I was stupid enough
to think

24:05.861 --> 24:07.988
I found true love with
married another girl.

24:07.988 --> 24:10.448
You should have seen the look
on poor Madison's face

24:10.448 --> 24:12.952
when I told her there's
no such thing as true love.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.912
Wait. You said
that to Madison?

24:14.912 --> 24:16.997
Your client?
The bride?

24:16.997 --> 24:19.666
Yeah. It's better she finds out
the truth now rather than later.

24:19.666 --> 24:21.668
Naomi, I know
that you got hurt,

24:21.668 --> 24:23.796
but it's not
really your place

24:23.796 --> 24:25.798
to crush another
girl's dreams.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.216
Okay, first of all,

24:27.216 --> 24:29.927
they're not dreams,
they're fairy tales.

24:29.927 --> 24:31.178
And secondly, I can throw

24:31.178 --> 24:33.013
the most perfect wedding
in the world,

24:33.013 --> 24:36.267
and it's still just smoke and
mirrors that hide the truth.

24:36.267 --> 24:38.811
Love does not exist.

24:38.811 --> 24:43.565
Now, would you be a dear
and fill up my wine glass?

24:43.565 --> 24:44.900
I'm parched.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.278
Mmm...

24:52.866 --> 24:55.369
Thank you so much
for letting me
borrow this.

24:55.369 --> 24:56.870
It looks perfect
on you.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.664
Well, you'd think
I would have gone

24:58.664 --> 25:00.124
and spent some
time shopping

25:00.124 --> 25:02.960
for my big movie
premiere, but nope.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.004
Hey, you've been
dealing with a lot.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.504
I think it's okay
that you don't feel

25:06.504 --> 25:07.965
like shopping on Robertson.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.591
What, is this what
you're wearing?
Mm-hmm.

25:09.591 --> 25:10.843
Oh, ouch!

25:10.843 --> 25:13.220
Yeah, you show up
in this level of sexy

25:13.220 --> 25:15.139
with the new manager
on your arm,

25:15.139 --> 25:17.515
you're just begging
for Navid to murder
an ice sculpture.

25:17.515 --> 25:19.852
Okay, well, Austin is
not coming with me.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.854
I don't know if I'm ready
to just jump into

25:21.854 --> 25:24.482
another doomed partnership,
you know?

25:24.482 --> 25:26.359
Yeah, I do.

25:26.359 --> 25:28.652
You're so lucky you have Navid.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.029
He seriously is the best.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.365
Yeah, he is.

25:32.365 --> 25:33.615
I love him.

25:33.615 --> 25:36.452
He deserves better.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.412
Wait.
What are you talking about?

25:38.412 --> 25:43.083
Nothing. Uh, do you think
that these will go?

25:43.083 --> 25:45.336
Silver, you can trust me.

25:45.336 --> 25:47.713
If there's something wrong,
you can tell me.

25:47.713 --> 25:48.881
It's just between us.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.136
Okay.

25:55.971 --> 25:58.391
(sighs)

25:58.391 --> 26:00.351
I think I might
be pregnant.

26:00.351 --> 26:02.644
It's not Navid's.

26:02.644 --> 26:03.603
Oh, my God.

26:03.603 --> 26:04.980
Yeah, I know. I told Navid

26:04.980 --> 26:07.024
that it was
just a random hookup,

26:07.024 --> 26:09.193
but that's not true.

26:09.193 --> 26:12.446
And I thought that I could
just get the guy out of my head,

26:12.446 --> 26:14.532
but I mean, if I'm pregnant
with his kid, then

26:14.532 --> 26:16.909
how can I keep pretending that
I don't have feelings for him?

26:16.909 --> 26:19.786
Wait. You have feelings
for this other guy?

26:19.786 --> 26:21.288
I don't know.

26:22.956 --> 26:24.250
Maybe.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.709
I think I might.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.711
Okay, but you just said
that you love Navid.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.838
I do. I love Navid, but...

26:29.838 --> 26:31.424
but isn't it possible

26:31.424 --> 26:33.551
to have feelings for two people
at the same time?

26:33.551 --> 26:36.262
Yeah, it is.

26:36.262 --> 26:39.223
But Silver, we're not
in high school anymore.

26:39.223 --> 26:42.226
If you really are pregnant,
then you can't play games.

26:42.226 --> 26:44.395
You have to tell
the father of the baby

26:44.395 --> 26:45.687
and make a decision.

26:49.400 --> 26:52.736
Oh, you have no idea how good
it feels to be out of there!

26:52.736 --> 26:54.530
(chuckles)

26:54.530 --> 26:56.574
Couldn't stand
the thought of you
rotting in that place.

26:56.574 --> 26:58.492
Yeah, well, I guess
I just didn't know

26:58.492 --> 27:00.953
how to deal with how I
was feeling, you know?

27:00.953 --> 27:02.496
I really freaked
some people out.

27:02.496 --> 27:03.872
Hell, it freaked me out.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.041
Okay, so you broke me
out of the nut house.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.418
What's the plan?

27:07.418 --> 27:09.587
I mean, you want
to get matching
henna tattoos?

27:14.883 --> 27:19.388
A few years ago, my
brother was killed.

27:19.388 --> 27:20.722
He started
messing around

27:20.722 --> 27:22.433
with a gang,
thought it was

27:22.433 --> 27:24.435
the only way to
make real money.

27:24.435 --> 27:29.731
And then one day he,
uh, he was gone.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.525
Diego, I'm so sorry.

27:31.525 --> 27:35.529
I was so angry.
Felt so... powerless.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.573
There was no way for
me to tell anybody

27:37.573 --> 27:39.408
in words what
I was feeling,

27:39.408 --> 27:42.202
so I started painting this.

27:43.661 --> 27:46.373
And ever since then,
whenever I have something

27:46.373 --> 27:48.750
I feel like I can't put
into words,

27:48.750 --> 27:50.419
I come here.

27:52.129 --> 27:53.464
And now it's your turn.

27:53.464 --> 27:55.715
Those people think
you're crazy, Ivy.

27:55.715 --> 27:57.426
I know you're not.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.970
How can anybody know
how you feel inside?

28:19.657 --> 28:21.575
WOMAN: Liam!

28:21.575 --> 28:23.536
Okay, thanks for riding
with me in this thing.

28:23.536 --> 28:25.787
WOMAN 2: Liam! Liam, can
we have your autograph?!

28:25.787 --> 28:27.414
Naomi sounded a little
drunk on the phone,

28:27.414 --> 28:29.166
and I have no idea
where Navid's at.

28:29.166 --> 28:31.126
(chuckles) Well, I'm sorry.

28:31.126 --> 28:33.212
He and Silver wanted
some alone time together.

28:34.712 --> 28:38.008
But I'm here,
and I'm so excited for you.

28:38.008 --> 28:39.635
Well, I'd be
a little more excited

28:39.635 --> 28:41.679
if I could get
this damn thing
to cooperate.

28:41.679 --> 28:43.305
Here.

28:44.139 --> 28:45.140
(sighs)

28:45.140 --> 28:47.100
Don't be nervous, okay?

28:47.100 --> 28:48.352
The movie is
the hard part.

28:48.352 --> 28:50.896
The premiere is
the fun part.

28:50.896 --> 28:53.232
Yeah. I guess I just
got a lot on my mind.

28:53.232 --> 28:56.360
You miss Vanessa, huh?

28:56.360 --> 28:57.736
(scoffs)
Not really.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.698
There is someone else, though.

29:00.698 --> 29:03.909
So soon? Liam, don't you think

29:03.909 --> 29:06.245
you should give your heart
some time

29:06.245 --> 29:07.371
to heal before moving on?

29:07.371 --> 29:08.914
Yeah, I guess I should have.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.374
(chuckles)

29:10.374 --> 29:13.669
I got involved with a girl
who worked on this film,

29:13.669 --> 29:16.505
and, uh, she's with
someone else now.

29:16.505 --> 29:19.174
And she's gonna be here tonight,
and I have no idea what to say.

29:20.593 --> 29:25.138

40:54.411 --> 40:57.289
MADISON: Naomi, I'd

40:57.289 --> 40:58.331
Max.

40:58.331 --> 41:01.251
Naomi?
