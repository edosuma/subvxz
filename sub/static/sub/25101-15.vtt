Republic we have been friends

10:22.303 --> 10:25.102
since we were kids.
We were always very passionate

10:25.103 --> 10:27.902
about dance.
But we didn't really have many

10:27.903 --> 10:30.038
resources to do what we love.

10:30.039 --> 10:32.172
So we just do it anywhere we

10:32.173 --> 10:34.123
could find.

10:34.124 --> 10:36.072
Even if it was just a parking

10:36.073 --> 10:38.573
lot.

10:38.574 --> 10:41.072
There is no job for dancers

10:41.073 --> 10:42.402
in the Dominican Republic.
So we came to the united

10:42.403 --> 10:45.438
states.

10:45.439 --> 10:48.472
And we're here on "America's got

30:55.669 --> 30:58.132
rounds but can he get you

30:58.133 --> 31:00.518
laughing tonight?

31:00.519 --> 31:02.902
Here's Samuel j. Comroe.

31:02.903 --> 31:04.388
Hey, there's the star.

31:04.389 --> 31:05.872
What's up?

31:05.873 --> 31:07.338
I knew from the beginning

31:07.339 --> 31:08.802
that I would support Sam on

31:08.803 --> 31:11.118
anything that he wanted to do,

31:11.119 --> 31:13.432
as long as he was following his

31:13.433 --> 31:15.802
heart.
I remember you wanted to be a

31:15.803 --> 31:18.432
veterinarian and oddly enough
that's where the tourette's

31:18.433 --> 31:20.702
would not have worked out very
well.

31:20.703 --> 31:22.818
You were like, dad, I changed my

31:22.819 --> 31:24.932
mind, I want to be a standup

31:24.933 --> 31:27.202
comedian.
That's every father's dream.

31:27.203 --> 31:28.968
I thought about doing comedy

31:28.969 --> 31:30.732
myself but to raise a family

31:30.733 --> 31:32.483
with seven kids is hard.

31:32.484 --> 31:34.232
Watching what you did when we

31:34.233 --> 31:35.953
were growing up and how you

31:35.954 --> 31:37.672
worked, I think it really

31:37.673 --> 31:39.823
inspired me.

31:39.824 --> 31:41.972
So I put my focus in on

31:41.973 --> 31:44.402
bringing home the bacon, feeding
the family.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.968
The most important advice is

31:45.969 --> 31:47.532
still love your audience.

31:47.533 --> 31:49.433
I think about that every time

31:49.434 --> 31:51.332
I got on stage.

31:51.333 --> 31:54.133
In my eyes Sam is the best

31:54.134 --> 31:56.932
comedian that has ever walked

31:56.933 --> 31:58.703
this earth.

31:58.704 --> 32:00.472
And Robin Williams is a close

32:00.473 --> 32:01.832
second.
Love you.

32:01.833 --> 32:04.533
Love you, too, son.

32:04.534 --> 32:07.232
Samuel comroe to the stage.

32:07.233 --> 32:08.432
That's me.
Love you.

32:08.433 --> 32:13.018
Love you.

32:23.773 --> 32:26.053
What up?

32:26.054 --> 32:28.332
Yo, I been working for this

32:28.333 --> 32:30.018
moment for over ten years and I

32:30.019 --> 32:31.702
got to tell you it's a dream

32:31.703 --> 32:33.653
come true to follow two dolphins

32:33.654 --> 32:35.602
doing whatever it is they were

32:35.603 --> 32:37.032
doing.
That's why I do this.

32:37.033 --> 32:39.253
My wife and I, we just got a

32:39.254 --> 32:41.472
puppy recently.

32:41.473 --> 32:43.123
Got it from the shelter.

32:43.124 --> 32:44.772
The lady told me she was a

32:44.773 --> 32:46.002
German Shepherd.
I was like, "dope.

32:46.003 --> 32:48.338
I got a police dog."

32:48.339 --> 32:50.672
I've had her for six years.

32:50.673 --> 32:53.132
She's still this big.
Which means either that lady

32:53.133 --> 32:55.218
lied to me or my dog has

32:55.219 --> 32:57.302
Benjamin button disease.

32:57.303 --> 33:01.453
She's slowly turning into a pug

33:01.454 --> 33:05.602
which are the worst, the

33:05.603 --> 33:06.702
uglyiest.
People keep telling me they're

33:06.703 --> 33:07.673
cute.
No, they're not!

33:07.674 --> 33:09.202
They don't have noses and they
look like they smoke.

33:09.203 --> 33:10.968
I got a dog so when stressful

33:10.969 --> 33:12.732
things happen in the real world

33:12.733 --> 33:15.433
I know when I go home and open

33:15.434 --> 33:18.132
my door, my dogs going to be

33:18.133 --> 33:18.933
there like,
"heeeeyyy!"

33:18.934 --> 33:19.972
And I'm gonna be like,
"heeeeyyy!"

33:19.973 --> 33:25.403
You can't do that with a pug.

33:25.404 --> 33:30.832
You're going to walk in like,

33:30.833 --> 33:31.803
"heeeeyyyy" and your pugs
like --

33:31.804 --> 33:33.332
"where you been?"
I love my dog.

33:33.333 --> 33:35.672
I walk her around the block all
day.

33:35.673 --> 33:37.202
That's my life.
I was walking her a few weeks

33:37.203 --> 33:40.703
ago and this guy in a truck

33:40.704 --> 33:44.202
pulled up next to me, slammed on

33:44.203 --> 33:45.732
his breaks, and said, "hey!

33:45.733 --> 33:47.432
You with the dog!
What kind of dog is that?"

33:47.433 --> 33:49.102
I was like, "I don't know.
She was supposed to be a German

33:49.103 --> 33:50.632
Shepherd.
I've never seen anything like

33:50.633 --> 33:53.072
her."
He said, "oh" and I said "why?"

33:53.073 --> 33:55.102
And he said, "because I have
one."

33:55.103 --> 33:58.403
Then he reached in his passenger

33:58.404 --> 34:01.702
seat and he pulled up a dog that

34:01.703 --> 34:03.418
looked exactly like my dog.

34:03.419 --> 34:05.132
I had a moment where time froze.

34:05.133 --> 34:07.768
I thought I was gonna look down

34:07.769 --> 34:10.402
and just be holding a leash.

34:10.402 --> 34:11.532
I was like,
damn you drive-by magician with

34:11.533 --> 34:13.868
your puppy magic.

34:13.869 --> 34:16.202
When I got her, though, she was

34:16.203 --> 34:18.402
really sick.

34:18.404 --> 34:20.601
This is no joke, 100% true.

34:20.603 --> 34:21.702
She was really sick.
I took her to the vet.

34:21.703 --> 34:23.938
$3,000.

34:23.938 --> 34:26.172
The vet was like, in a

34:26.172 --> 34:27.601
30 day period you can take her
back and switch her out for a

34:27.603 --> 34:29.072
new one.
I said I'm not renting a movie.

34:29.072 --> 34:32.172
I love her and I paid the money.
I bring it up because I'm from

34:32.172 --> 34:33.431
Los Angeles, but I've seen it
all over the country.

34:33.433 --> 34:35.272
A lot of homeless people.
And every homeless person I've

34:35.273 --> 34:38.638
ever seen always has a dog.

34:38.639 --> 34:42.002
And as a kid, I was like, where

34:42.003 --> 34:43.453
are all these homeless people

34:43.454 --> 34:44.902
finding all these dogs?

34:44.902 --> 34:46.331
Now that I got a dog my theory
has completely changed.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.402
I don't think you're homeless
and you just find a dog.

34:48.402 --> 34:49.972
I think what happens is you go
to the shelter.

34:49.973 --> 34:51.523
You try to do something nice.

34:51.524 --> 34:53.072
You adopt a dog.

34:53.072 --> 34:55.688
That dog gets sick.

34:55.688 --> 34:58.302
You invest your hard earned

34:58.303 --> 35:00.488
money into that dog's health.

35:00.489 --> 35:02.672
You become homeless and then you

35:02.673 --> 35:06.103
keep that dog because you

35:06.104 --> 35:09.532
deserve it.

35:09.533 --> 35:13.603
I'm Samuel comroe, thank you.

35:13.604 --> 35:17.672
Tyra: Look at that standing

35:17.673 --> 35:20.032
ovation!
Do you see that standing

35:20.033 --> 35:21.753
ovation?

35:21.754 --> 35:23.472
Feels good, huh?

35:23.473 --> 35:25.023
Yeah.

35:25.024 --> 35:26.572
Tyra: Howie, comedian here.

35:26.573 --> 35:27.732
Howie: First of all, well
done.

35:27.733 --> 35:29.318
I have to say when you came out

35:29.319 --> 35:30.902
the first time you talked about

35:30.903 --> 35:32.588
tourette's.

35:32.589 --> 35:34.272
This time I didn't see any

35:34.273 --> 35:37.172
tourette's except the video guy
operating the video behind you.

35:37.173 --> 35:39.338
Tyra: It's flashing, right?

35:39.339 --> 35:41.502
Howie: There's something

35:41.503 --> 35:43.618
going behind you which for a

35:43.619 --> 35:45.732
comedian is incredibly

35:45.733 --> 35:47.202
distracting.
It's still going on.

35:47.203 --> 35:49.068
You worked through adversity and

35:49.069 --> 35:50.932
we love you and good job.

35:50.933 --> 35:53.453
And hopefully they can get the

35:53.454 --> 35:55.972
video wall fixed.

35:55.973 --> 35:57.688
Tyra: Live TV y'all.

35:57.689 --> 35:59.402
Heidi.

35:59.403 --> 36:02.402
Heidi: I really like you and
I really, really like your

36:02.403 --> 36:04.018
delivery.

36:04.019 --> 36:05.632
I just didn't love what you were

36:05.633 --> 36:07.232
delivering.
Okay.

36:07.233 --> 36:08.783
Heidi: To me -I'm sorry, I

36:08.784 --> 36:10.332
just have to tell you what I

36:10.333 --> 36:11.383
think.

36:11.384 --> 36:12.432
It's all good.

36:12.433 --> 36:15.032
Heidi: To me it wasn't your
strongest performance today.

36:15.033 --> 36:17.018
But that's just me.

36:17.019 --> 36:19.002
Tyra: Simon, what do you

36:19.003 --> 36:21.002
think?
Simon: I'm looking at who's

36:21.003 --> 36:23.872
coming up in the running order,
and it's someone who's put a

36:23.873 --> 36:25.973
curse on the show, which is

36:25.974 --> 36:28.072
explaining all the stuff that's

36:28.073 --> 36:29.372
happening --
Tyra: That's true.

36:29.373 --> 36:31.473
Simon: I'm serious.

36:31.474 --> 36:33.572
This is ghostly what's happening

36:33.573 --> 36:35.038
at the moment, live TV.

36:35.039 --> 36:36.502
Samuel, you are amazing.

36:36.503 --> 36:39.018
I really like you.

36:39.019 --> 36:41.532
I really hope America gets

36:41.533 --> 36:43.618
behind you.

36:43.619 --> 36:45.702
And the sacred riana will you

36:45.703 --> 36:48.638
stop doing whatever you're doing

36:48.639 --> 36:51.572
to the show right now, please.

36:51.573 --> 36:54.923
Tyra: All right, Samuel.

36:54.924 --> 36:58.272
Mel: I love you.

36:58.273 --> 36:59.953
Tyra: Mel loves.

36:59.954 --> 37:01.632
I love the way you talk like

37:01.633 --> 37:04.102
this.
I'm going to do it all night

37:04.103 --> 37:04.973
long.
Let's keep it moving.

37:04.974 --> 37:06.572
The youngest performer of the
season is coming up next.

37:06.573 --> 37:08.072
She's just five years old, and
she's here with 70 of her best

37:08.073 --> 37:09.073
friends.
Here's the voices of hope

37:09.074 --> 37:11.573
children's choir.

37:11.574 --> 37:14.072
I love the choir so much.

37:14.073 --> 37:16.632
It's just the best choir in the
world I would say.

37:16.633 --> 37:19.053
I love voices of hope because

37:19.054 --> 37:21.472
we're such a family and we get

37:21.473 --> 37:23.202
along so great.
This choir feels like

37:23.203 --> 37:24.868
everybody can just express what

37:24.869 --> 37:26.532
they feel like.

37:26.533 --> 37:29.653
I love it because it's free

37:29.654 --> 37:32.772
and I can save all my money.

37:32.773 --> 37:35.503
I never in a million years

37:35.504 --> 37:38.232
thought I would have the guts to

37:38.233 --> 37:40.732
perform in front of such a large
crowd.

37:40.733 --> 37:43.232
But being in voices of hope gave
me the courage to go after my

37:43.233 --> 37:46.303
dreams.

37:46.304 --> 37:49.372
And getting the golden buzzer is

37:49.373 --> 37:53.153
amazing to me.

37:53.154 --> 37:56.932
It's one of the only times

37:56.933 --> 38:00.018
I've cried.

38:00.019 --> 38:03.102
It's amazing, because we're

38:03.103 --> 38:05.118
going to the live shows and how

38:05.119 --> 38:07.132
many choirs get to do that?

40:44.304 --> 40:48.202
I'm back there trying to hold

40:48.203 --> 40:49.768
back tierears.

40:49.769 --> 40:51.332
Mel b how are you feeling?

40:51.333 --> 40:54.218
Mel: Voices of hope,

40:54.219 --> 40:57.102
children's choir.

40:57.103 --> 40:59.188
You give many voices hope.

40:59.189 --> 41:01.272
You sound amazing and incredible

41:01.273 --> 41:04.102
together.
As much as I enjoyed it, as much

41:04.103 --> 41:06.388
as I really did enjoy it, and

41:06.389 --> 41:08.672
your harmonies and your

41:08.673 --> 41:10.603
choreography and what you're

41:10.604 --> 41:12.532
wearing, the song for me wasn't

41:12.533 --> 41:14.553
quite right.

41:14.554 --> 41:16.572
But that's just my opinion.

41:16.573 --> 41:18.388
Tyra: Simon, why did you give

41:18.389 --> 41:20.202
her an x to the face.

41:20.203 --> 41:22.638
Mel: Because he always does.

41:22.639 --> 41:25.072
Simon: I could not disagree

41:25.073 --> 41:27.272
more.
This was the absolutely perfect

41:27.273 --> 41:29.172
song.
I was thinking when you were

41:29.173 --> 41:30.823
performing, if I had a product

41:30.824 --> 41:32.472
called happiness, that would be

41:32.473 --> 41:35.888
the commercial.

41:35.889 --> 41:39.302
I really, really like you guys.

41:39.303 --> 41:41.418
You've worked so much harder --

41:41.419 --> 41:43.532
I know how hard you've worked.

41:43.533 --> 41:46.232
These kids are amazing.
I want them in the show all the

41:46.233 --> 41:48.102
way to the end.
Please.

41:48.103 --> 41:49.688
Thank you.

41:49.689 --> 41:51.272
Thank you so much.

41:51.273 --> 41:53.488
Tyra: Heidi, you look to be

41:53.489 --> 41:55.702
beaming with happiness.

41:55.703 --> 41:56.953
Heidi: I am.

41:56.954 --> 41:58.202
You should be proud of

41:58.203 --> 41:59.802
yourselves.
You just sang in front of

41:59.803 --> 42:02.502
millions and millions and
millions of people, and you did

42:02.503 --> 42:04.918
so well.

42:04.919 --> 42:07.332
Also the solo vocals were also

42:07.333 --> 42:08.918
on point as Mel would say.

42:08.919 --> 42:10.502
On point.

42:10.503 --> 42:12.268
Tyra: Howie?

42:12.269 --> 42:14.032
Howie: I'm not only

42:14.033 --> 42:16.972
fascinated by the children, but
with Simon and how he was able

42:16.973 --> 42:19.338
to do the choreography.

42:19.339 --> 42:21.702
I would say, the children are

42:21.703 --> 42:23.988
our future -hey, write that

42:23.989 --> 42:26.272
down.

42:26.273 --> 42:28.538
Tyra: Good luck tonight.

42:28.539 --> 42:30.802
Mel, props to you to being

42:30.803 --> 42:33.332
constructive.
These kids are counting on you.

42:33.333 --> 42:34.772
Simon says they're happiness.

42:37.273 --> 42:42.403

42:42.404 --> 42:47.532
So get busy.

42:47.533 --> 42:49.453
Announcer: Coming up.

42:49.454 --> 42:51.372
Simon: I think there's a gap

42:51.373 --> 42:54.038
in the market for this.

42:54.039 --> 42:56.702
Mel: That was brilliant,

42:56.703 --> 42:59.132
brilliant, brilliant.
Howie: That was amazing.

42:59.133 --> 43:07.568
Simon: It's

43:07.569 --> 43:16.002
so dogs have always been a very

43:16.003 --> 43:17.953
popular act on "agt."

43:17.954 --> 43:19.902
And Simon loves them.

43:19.903 --> 43:22.168
Well this year cats are fighting

43:22.169 --> 43:24.432
back.

43:24.433 --> 43:26.368
Here is the savitsky cats.

43:26.369 --> 43:28.302
We love our cats.

43:28.303 --> 43:29.888
But when we are not with

43:29.889 --> 43:31.472
them, there's no telling what

43:31.473 --> 43:32.923
they're up to.

43:32.924 --> 43:34.372
Finally.

43:34.373 --> 43:35.803
Wow.

43:35.804 --> 43:37.232
The TV really does add ten

43:37.233 --> 43:39.632
pounds.
You know why that was so

43:39.633 --> 43:42.672
impressive because dogs want to
please.

43:42.673 --> 43:45.288
Because they're idiots.

43:45.289 --> 43:47.902
Cats are like make me, they

43:47.903 --> 43:49.368
have cat attitude.

43:49.369 --> 43:50.832
That's right.

43:50.833 --> 43:52.153
What's up ladies?

43:52.154 --> 43:53.472
What do you want?

43:53.473 --> 43:55.973
I was thinking after the show

43:55.974 --> 43:58.472
tonight, you, me, saucer of

43:58.473 --> 44:01.188
milk.

44:01.189 --> 44:03.902
You know I'm lactose

44:03.903 --> 44:05.702
intolerant.
I guess I'll see you at the

44:05.703 --> 44:06.788
show.

44:06.789 --> 44:07.872
I'm such an idiot.

44:07.873 --> 44:09.688
Where's my tuna?

44:09.689 --> 44:11.502
Oh, humans.

44:11.503 --> 44:14.068
Take it away.

44:14.069 --> 44:16.632
This is just the -fur ball.

44:16.633 --> 44:18.533
Oh my god, look at eddy, he's

44:18.534 --> 44:20.432
always training.

44:20.433 --> 44:22.068
And a five, six, seven,

44:22.069 --> 44:23.702
eight.

44:23.703 --> 44:25.453
I should probably go

44:25.454 --> 44:27.202
practice, too after my cat nap.

44:27.203 --> 44:30.218
If we win $1 million divided

44:30.219 --> 44:33.232
by all the cats, that's a lot of

44:33.233 --> 44:34.683

47:21.103 --> 47:23.972
Tyra: Standing ovation from
Heidi.

47:23.973 --> 47:25.588
Come on forward.

47:25.589 --> 47:27.202
I have to let you guys know,

47:27.203 --> 47:29.018
you're thinking I'm seeing a lot

47:29.019 --> 47:30.832
of stuff happen with the crew

47:30.833 --> 47:33.772
back here this week.
That's because these doors back

47:33.773 --> 47:35.738
here normally hide what's going

47:35.739 --> 47:37.702
on, but they are busted.

47:37.703 --> 47:39.303
They are broke y'all, but that's

47:39.304 --> 47:40.902
live TV.

47:40.903 --> 47:42.588
Judges talk to me about this

47:42.589 --> 47:44.272
act.

47:44.273 --> 47:49.753
Heidi: You've got to be

47:49.754 --> 47:55.232
kit-ing me.

47:55.233 --> 47:57.933
This could have been a

47:57.934 --> 48:00.632
catastrophe.

48:00.633 --> 48:03.272
Tyra: Simons dieing right
now.

48:03.273 --> 48:06.002
Howie: Are you judging her
puns?

48:06.003 --> 48:07.438
Heidi: You loved it.

48:07.439 --> 48:08.872
You loved the act.

48:08.873 --> 48:11.003
Simon: Go to him.

48:11.004 --> 48:13.132
Tyra: Howie?

48:13.133 --> 48:15.702
Howie: I think it's great,
amazing.

48:15.703 --> 48:18.753
You see it done with dogs.

48:18.754 --> 48:21.802
We're seeing things that aren't

48:21.803 --> 48:24.102
normally done with cats.
I don't think this is up from

48:24.103 --> 48:27.153
the last time I saw it.

48:27.154 --> 48:30.202
I don't know if they stepped it

48:30.203 --> 48:31.632
up.
Heidi: They stepped it up.

48:31.633 --> 48:34.283
Cats normally don't do anything.

48:34.284 --> 48:36.932
Give it to the cats.

48:36.933 --> 48:39.832
Tyra: Simon, have you pulled
it together?

48:39.833 --> 48:41.653
Simon is having like an allergic

48:41.654 --> 48:43.472
reaction.

48:43.473 --> 48:45.553
Mel, you see upset.

48:45.554 --> 48:47.632
What's wrong?

48:47.633 --> 48:49.753
He's still laughing at my jokes.

48:49.754 --> 48:51.872
Mel: You two are amazing for

48:51.873 --> 48:53.638
training the cats to do what

48:53.639 --> 48:55.402
they do.

48:55.403 --> 48:57.938
But I mean, I think I enjoyed

48:57.939 --> 49:00.472
the music more than I did the

49:00.473 --> 49:03.632
cats, but I love the cats.
Do you know how hard it is to

49:03.633 --> 49:06.518
do this?

49:06.519 --> 49:09.402
Tyra: You know what, it's so

49:09.403 --> 49:10.918
not going to happen.

49:10.919 --> 49:12.432
It's not happening.

49:12.433 --> 49:15.172
Good luck to you guys.
I don't know what Simon things.

49:15.173 --> 49:17.872
But we want to know what you
think.

49:17.873 --> 49:19.903
If you vote, your favorites have

49:19.904 --> 49:21.932
a shot at the semifinals.

49:21.933 --> 49:23.618
But if you don't vote, they're

49:23.619 --> 49:25.302
going to be outta here.

49:25.303 --> 49:26.572

49:33.833 --> 49:35.532
longer than most for her shot at
stardom, and a dancer who's

waited even longer!

this!

49:42.033 --> 49:50.033

49:50.034 --> 49:58.032
Tyra: Tomorrow night we're

49:58.033 --> 49:59.753
going to get the results from

49:59.754 --> 50:01.472
tonight's show.

50:01.473 --> 50:03.632
And only seven acts will make it
through.

50:03.633 --> 50:07.433
And the stars of the smash hill

50:07.434 --> 50:11.232
magic show "the illusion fists"

50:11.233 --> 50:14.433
will be in the house.

50:14.434 --> 50:17.632
Along with my golden buzzer act

50:17.633 --> 50:20.833
from last season, light balance.

50:20.834 --> 50:24.032
That's tomorrow.

50:24.033 --> 50:25.932
Okay, this next singer has --
well, she's waited a looong time

50:25.933 --> 50:27.202
for her shot.
And now, everything hangs on the

50:27.203 --> 50:29.268
next couple of minutes.

50:29.269 --> 50:31.332
Here's glennis grace.

50:31.333 --> 50:33.503
As a kid I always dreamed of

50:33.504 --> 50:35.672
singing for the whole world.

50:35.673 --> 50:37.323
Singing was like dreaming for

50:37.324 --> 50:38.972
me.

50:38.973 --> 50:40.853
My whole life I've been walking

50:40.854 --> 50:42.732
towards that dream.

50:42.733 --> 50:45.153
But growing up I wasn't the most

50:45.154 --> 50:47.572
confident kid.

50:47.573 --> 50:49.288
Some close friends said, I don't

50:49.289 --> 50:51.002
think you're going to make it.

50:51.003 --> 50:52.588
That feeling always stayed with

50:52.589 --> 50:54.172
me, or those thoughts.

50:54.173 --> 50:56.288
And I was afraid to put myself

50:56.289 --> 50:58.402
out there.

50:58.403 --> 51:02.153
I just felt like I did not

51:02.154 --> 51:05.902
deserve what I wanted in life.

51:05.903 --> 51:07.288
Simon: I feel like I'm

51:07.289 --> 51:08.672
looking at a star already.

54:22.273 --> 54:24.523
thank god.

54:24.524 --> 54:26.772
I feel like Hugh Jackman in "the

54:26.773 --> 54:28.638
greatest showman" when we talk

54:28.639 --> 54:30.502
about people coming to the live

54:30.503 --> 54:32.453
shows and taking it and having a

54:32.454 --> 54:34.402
moment, that's what it just was.

54:34.403 --> 54:35.918
That was a moment.

54:35.919 --> 54:37.432
The fact you put all those key

54:37.433 --> 54:39.533
changes into it, I thought no,

54:39.534 --> 54:41.632
you can't go any higher.

54:41.633 --> 54:43.903
Then you went higher.

54:43.904 --> 54:46.172
That was classy, brilliant,

54:46.173 --> 54:47.773
fantastic.

54:49.373 --> 54:51.453
Howie: It's like I said at

54:51.454 --> 54:53.532
the beginning of the show, it's

54:53.533 --> 54:55.718
a tough year.

54:55.719 --> 54:57.902
Everyone is competing.

54:57.903 --> 55:02.053
I have Paul Stan liley here, the

55:02.054 --> 55:06.202
lead singer from kiss and he

55:06.203 --> 55:07.738
said to me wow.

55:07.739 --> 55:09.272
I can't say it better.

55:09.273 --> 55:11.903
I think you brought it.

55:11.904 --> 55:14.532

Mel: What I love about you,

you're a single parent mother.

55:18.573 --> 55:20.488
Is it one boy.

55:20.489 --> 55:22.402
Yes, one boy.

55:22.403 --> 55:24.272
He's 12 years old.
Mel: You're doing it

55:24.273 --> 55:26.003

55:26.004 --> 55:27.732
your power and showing the world

You killed it tonight.

55:30.573 --> 55:32.473
You brought tears to my eyes.

55:32.474 --> 55:34.372
Moving forward, don't wear that

55:38.104 --> 55:41.832
Don't.

All right, here's a cautionary

55:54.833 --> 55:57.703
warning.

55:57.704 --> 56:00.572
Simon's been talking about this

56:00.573 --> 56:03.102
tonight.
If you have to watch scary

56:03.103 --> 56:04.703
movies through your fingers like

56:04.704 --> 56:06.302
this.

56:06.303 --> 01:03:01.688
You might want

01:03:01.689 --> 01:09:57.072
Tyra: Back with the auditions

01:09:57.073 --> 01:09:58.723
we let the judges have a wild

01:09:58.724 --> 01:10:00.372
card.

01:10:00.373 --> 01:10:02.653
An act they could put straight

01:10:02.654 --> 01:10:04.932
through to the live shows and

01:10:04.933 --> 01:10:06.653
this is it.

01:10:06.654 --> 01:10:08.372
I got two words for you, minds

01:10:08.373 --> 01:10:10.753
blown.

01:10:10.754 --> 01:10:13.132
Here's front pictures

01:10:13.133 --> 01:10:15.233
computers changed my life

01:10:15.234 --> 01:10:17.332
completely.

01:10:17.333 --> 01:10:19.568
It was like love at first sight.

01:10:19.569 --> 01:10:21.802
So like, wow.

01:10:21.803 --> 01:10:23.203
I think humanity has already

01:10:23.204 --> 01:10:24.602
reached the limits of the

01:10:24.603 --> 01:10:26.932
physical world.
So if you want to reach new

01:10:26.933 --> 01:10:29.318
possibilities, I think the only

01:10:29.319 --> 01:10:31.702
way to do it is to create

01:10:31.703 --> 01:10:34.572
virtual worlds.
Welcome to virtual reality.

01:10:34.573 --> 01:10:36.538
It's exciting to see things

01:10:36.539 --> 01:10:38.502
we've never really seen before.

01:10:38.503 --> 01:10:40.603
I believe we can create new

01:10:40.604 --> 01:10:42.702
worlds.

01:10:42.703 --> 01:10:44.818
Imagine you can travel wherever

01:10:44.819 --> 01:10:46.932
you want, you can travel through

01:10:46.933 --> 01:10:48.572

01:10:53.689 --> 01:10:55.402
it's bigger than the audience

01:10:55.403 --> 01:10:57.118
has seen before.

01:10:57.119 --> 01:10:58.832
The lines between the virtual

01:10:58.833 --> 01:11:00.403
and the reality have become

01:11:00.404 --> 01:11:01.972
blurred.

01:11:01.973 --> 01:11:04.053
No one knows what is real

01:11:04.054 --> 01:11:06.132
anymore.

01:11:06.133 --> 01:11:17.173

Heidi: You are taking us to a

different dimension.

01:14:45.073 --> 01:14:47.403

I loved it.

01:14:50.574 --> 01:14:52.503
We see a lot of these type of

01:14:52.504 --> 01:14:54.432

01:14:54.433 --> 01:14:55.583
as you guys.

01:14:55.584 --> 01:14:56.732
What's happening?

01:14:56.733 --> 01:15:00.068
Tyra: He's so excited his mic

just dropped.

01:15:06.533 --> 01:15:08.472
Boom.
Heidi: It looked like so much

01:15:08.473 --> 01:15:09.888
fun I want to ride around on

01:15:09.889 --> 01:15:11.302

Simon: I have a wobbly mic

now because of you.

01:15:19.404 --> 01:15:21.172

01:15:24.704 --> 01:15:28.232
Because that was astonishingly

01:15:28.233 --> 01:15:30.502
good.
I felt like I was in a movie.

01:15:30.503 --> 01:15:32.788
There was sections of the act

01:15:32.789 --> 01:15:35.072
reminded me of working with you

01:15:35.073 --> 01:15:37.173
and Mel.

01:15:37.174 --> 01:15:39.272
Remember the bit where he's on

01:15:39.273 --> 01:15:40.472

chasing him.

01:15:40.473 --> 01:15:42.988
Mel: He's calling us witches,

at home.

01:15:51.633 --> 01:15:53.918
The ingenuity is off the hook.

01:15:53.919 --> 01:15:56.202
We watched what you did, and

01:15:56.203 --> 01:15:57.618
Simon can't even get his

01:15:57.619 --> 01:15:59.032
microphone together.

01:15:59.033 --> 01:16:02.233
So that juxtaposition of

01:16:02.234 --> 01:16:05.432
technology just shows us new

01:16:05.433 --> 01:16:06.472

I don't understand the story.

01:16:26.424 --> 01:16:28.272
What was the story?

01:16:28.273 --> 01:16:31.272
Simon: Witches after someone
on a broomstick.

01:16:31.273 --> 01:16:32.873
Mel: Was that it?

01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:36.872

So our last act is going to

01:16:46.754 --> 01:16:49.132
attempt a seriously dangerous

01:16:49.133 --> 01:16:51.202
thing.
It went really, really bad the

01:16:51.203 --> 01:16:53.468
last time.

01:16:53.469 --> 01:16:55.732

Tyra: So here is our last act

01:17:12.073 --> 01:17:14.602
tonight.
Now you've ever wondered if the

01:17:14.603 --> 01:17:17.538
risk on agt are real, this act

01:17:17.539 --> 01:17:20.472
got everyone talking at the

01:17:20.473 --> 01:17:22.753

01:17:22.754 --> 01:17:25.032
TV news channels blew up.

01:17:25.033 --> 01:17:26.233
They darn near broke the

01:17:27.433 --> 01:17:29.818

Terror on the trapeze.

01:17:34.289 --> 01:17:36.372
We witnessed the most

01:17:36.373 --> 01:17:39.188
frightening accident in history.

01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:42.002
When a trapeze artist dropped

01:17:42.003 --> 01:17:44.818
his wife from midair.

01:17:44.819 --> 01:17:47.632
The daring trapeze act going

01:17:47.633 --> 01:17:49.683
off without a hitch until she

01:17:49.684 --> 01:17:51.732
slipped from our blindfolded

01:17:51.733 --> 01:17:53.932
husband's hands.
I was watching at home with

01:17:53.933 --> 01:17:56.383
my kids we freaked out.

01:17:56.384 --> 01:17:58.832
On top of all this, tyce is

01:17:58.833 --> 01:18:01.003
legally blind in one eye.

01:18:01.004 --> 01:18:03.172
To make the stunt harder he wore

01:18:03.173 --> 01:18:05.632
a blindfold.
This was the first time with

01:18:05.633 --> 01:18:08.532
the blind followed.
Just inches away from flames.

01:18:08.533 --> 01:18:10.972
Both of them were so clearly
emotional.

01:18:10.973 --> 01:18:13.132
Will they try that same stunt
again?

01:18:13.133 --> 01:18:15.302
Yes.
Mistakes happen we have to

01:18:15.303 --> 01:18:17.572
keep going.
We cannot wait to see what

01:18:17.573 --> 01:18:19.373
they're going to do next.

01:18:19.374 --> 01:18:21.172
This is a Vegas act.

01:18:21.173 --> 01:18:22.723
The best part is not knowing

01:18:22.724 --> 01:18:24.272
what's going to happen.

01:18:24.273 --> 01:18:30.223
That's why I love the show.

01:18:30.224 --> 01:18:36.172

What?

01:21:44.219 --> 01:21:48.202
Heidi?

01:21:48.203 --> 01:21:49.638
To quote Mel, what just

01:21:49.639 --> 01:21:51.072
happened?

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:53.772
Heidi: Hands down, one of the
best acts of the night.

01:21:53.773 --> 01:21:55.073
That's what I think.

01:21:55.074 --> 01:21:56.372
Really, hands down.

01:21:56.373 --> 01:21:57.823
That was so good.

01:21:57.824 --> 01:21:59.272
And I have to say, I was so

01:21:59.273 --> 01:22:01.303
worried because you know the

01:22:01.304 --> 01:22:03.332
last time you did fall on the

01:22:03.333 --> 01:22:06.268
floor, so naturally you sit here

01:22:06.269 --> 01:22:09.202
and think I hope it doesn't

01:22:09.203 --> 01:22:11.732
happen again.
But it didn't happen again, you

01:22:11.733 --> 01:22:13.118
didn't fall on the floor.

01:22:13.119 --> 01:22:14.502
It was perfect, it was

01:22:14.503 --> 01:22:15.918
fantastic.

01:22:15.919 --> 01:22:17.332
I love you guys.

01:22:17.333 --> 01:22:19.033
I also love the love between you

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:20.732
guys.

01:22:20.733 --> 01:22:23.083
One of the best acts of the

01:22:23.084 --> 01:22:25.432
night.

Tyra: Mel b?

01:22:27.934 --> 01:22:30.432
Mel: Let's not forget your

01:22:30.433 --> 01:22:32.103
eye --

01:22:32.104 --> 01:22:33.772
Howie: Eyesight.

01:22:33.773 --> 01:22:36.702
Mel: Is deteriorating day by
day.

01:22:36.703 --> 01:22:39.388
Howie: Like your row cab lar.

01:22:39.389 --> 01:22:42.072
Mel: I'm going to get you.

01:22:42.073 --> 01:22:44.488
That's all I've got.

01:22:44.489 --> 01:22:46.902
Tyra: Are you going to defend

01:22:46.903 --> 01:22:48.618
her, Simon?

01:22:48.619 --> 01:22:50.332
Tyra: Mel is so insulted

01:22:50.333 --> 01:22:52.568
she's exiting the building.

01:22:52.569 --> 01:22:54.802
Simon: Back to you guys,

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.568
brave, incredible, nuts.

01:22:56.569 --> 01:22:58.332
I would like to see the fire

01:22:58.333 --> 01:22:59.672
back.
For you, yes.

01:22:59.673 --> 01:23:02.323
For you, yes, we'll do it.

01:23:02.324 --> 01:23:04.972
Simon: You really are

01:23:04.973 --> 01:23:06.773
outstanding.

01:23:06.774 --> 01:23:08.572
Tyra: Howie.

01:23:08.573 --> 01:23:11.602
Howie: I was looking forward,
with fear and trepidation, to

01:23:11.603 --> 01:23:13.168
seeing you redeem yourself from

01:23:13.169 --> 01:23:14.732
the fall.

01:23:14.733 --> 01:23:16.433
There's so much trust, it's

01:23:16.434 --> 01:23:18.132
amazing.

01:23:18.133 --> 01:23:20.203
I've been with my wife 40 years

01:23:20.204 --> 01:23:22.272
and there's no way she trusts me

01:23:22.273 --> 01:23:24.772
10% of what this one is trusting
you.

01:23:24.773 --> 01:23:26.288
This is amazing.

01:23:26.289 --> 01:23:27.802
This is what "America's got

01:23:27.803 --> 01:23:30.318
talent" is all about.

01:23:30.319 --> 01:23:32.832
Danger, passion, excitement.

01:23:32.833 --> 01:23:35.103
All in one package.

01:23:35.104 --> 01:23:37.372
America has to vote.

01:23:37.373 --> 01:23:40.003
Tyra: Vote, vote, vote.

01:23:40.004 --> 01:23:42.632
Bluk to

01:23:42.633 --> 01:23:44.332

now and all the acts are relying

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:49.202
Eastern tomorrow morning.

01:23:49.203 --> 01:23:51.332
Seven acts go through, five acts
go home.

01:23:51.333 --> 01:23:52.532
It all comes down to the results
tomorrow night.

01:23:52.533 --> 01:23:54.972
Voting will stay open through
the night, so get to it.

01:23:54.973 --> 01:23:57.032
We'll see you tomorrow.
And the illusionists and light

01:23:57.033 --> 01:23:59.132
balance will be heating up the
stage.

01:23:59.133 --> 01:24:01.202
