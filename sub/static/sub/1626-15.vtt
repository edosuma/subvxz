00:03.203 --> 00:05.504
Max, your boyfriend
is naked and waving

00:05.506 --> 00:08.007
From the dumpster
he calls his apartment.

00:08.009 --> 00:10.009
Make sure it's deke.

00:10.011 --> 00:11.043
Last time you said that,

00:11.045 --> 00:12.344
I went over,
and it was just

00:12.346 --> 00:14.513
A naked meth head
in a normal dumpster.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.316
I mean, we had a blast,
but still.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.952
Well, at least that meth head
bought a bunch of cupcakes.

00:19.954 --> 00:21.220
I mean, he thought
they were alive,

00:21.222 --> 00:22.988
But he bought them.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.823
Hey, I'm gonna
cut out early.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.959
You're sleeping over
again?

00:26.961 --> 00:29.161
Seriously, max,
sleeping in a dumpster?

00:29.163 --> 00:31.663
Are you trying
to bring sars back?

00:31.665 --> 00:33.999
Well, I did bring it in
the first time,

00:34.001 --> 00:35.401
And that is the last time
I hook up

00:35.403 --> 00:37.002
With a bat in thailand.

00:37.004 --> 00:39.505
(deke)
hey, max.

00:39.507 --> 00:42.975
Ugh!

she have a prostate exam

01:01.095 --> 01:03.328
'cause I'm not falling
for that again.

01:03.330 --> 01:06.632
Relax, she's just down
the street at deke's place.

01:06.634 --> 01:07.933
You know how it is
when you

01:07.935 --> 01:09.501
First start sleeping
with somebody,

01:09.503 --> 01:10.769
And you can't keep
your hands off each other.

01:10.771 --> 01:14.440
Yeah, just take
my word for it.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.975
I know I couldn't keep my hands

I'm talking, of course,
about my penis.

I just heard two hobos
getting freaky in the garbage.

Sophie,
that was max and deke.

Oh, I get it.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.771
You gotta do crazy things
to keep it fresh.

01:45.773 --> 01:49.575
You know, I once had sex
on a bus, and I was driving.

01:51.478 --> 01:54.713
Boy, were those kids
late to school.

01:56.616 --> 01:59.351
That's it,
I am marching over there

01:59.353 --> 02:00.719
And putting my foot down
with max.

02:00.721 --> 02:03.188
No one has sex
on my clock.

02:03.190 --> 02:06.692
Well, maybe your clock's
not big enough.

02:06.694 --> 02:09.595
That's it.
No more free jell-o.

Max!

02:18.405 --> 02:19.538
Max, open up.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.606
I'm very upset.

02:20.608 --> 02:21.940
More upset
than that time

02:21.942 --> 02:24.409
You enrolled me
in little league.

02:24.411 --> 02:28.714
Hey, it was your decision
to play the full season.

02:28.716 --> 02:31.483
Oh, goody, I was hoping
for some hecklers at this,

Hello, little girl.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.463
I'll take three boxes
of samoas and a thin mints.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.064
Don't forget
my tagalongs.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.833
They're called
peanut butter patties now.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.002
Why must I be that person?

What up, fools?

02:51.172 --> 02:53.405
Hey, girl.

02:53.407 --> 02:56.275
Max, you're 48 minutes
late for work.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.410
Look, little debbie,

02:58.412 --> 02:59.878
We're in here preparing

02:59.880 --> 03:01.914
For a big pastry school
competition tomorrow.

03:01.916 --> 03:04.149
And having sex.

03:04.151 --> 03:06.218
And if you ever interrupt me
while I am studying...

03:06.220 --> 03:08.153
And having sex.

03:08.155 --> 03:10.689
Again, I will dropkick
your baby-powdered ass

03:10.691 --> 03:13.659
Back to the shire
with the other hobbits.

03:13.661 --> 03:16.428
I told her.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.508
Everyone,
final touches.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.742
That's what I used to say

03:30.744 --> 03:32.711
When I finished
my shift at hooters.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.346
Hot. You still got
that uniform?

03:34.348 --> 03:35.881
Oh, not sure
it'd fit me anymore.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.617
I used to have
really big boobs.

03:38.619 --> 03:41.253
Bebe, how much time
is there left?

03:41.255 --> 03:42.854
For all of us?

03:42.856 --> 03:46.391
Oh, oh, gosh,
I'd say two months, tops.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.560
No, no,
for the cake competition.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.696
Oh, 60 seconds.

03:50.698 --> 03:53.031
Only 60 seconds?
Come on!

03:53.033 --> 03:55.100
I'm sorry, I can't handle
this pressure.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.568
It's only a matter
of time

03:56.570 --> 04:00.472
Before I start eating
my eyelashes again.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.774
The winning team will earn
a free week of class.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.811
And also--how do you say--
bragging rights.

04:31.572 --> 04:34.640
I am way too excited
about this.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.075
Okay, everybody.
I see a clear favorite here.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.977
But, caroline,
in truth,

04:38.979 --> 04:41.513
If I were to pick the prettiest
flower in the room,

04:41.515 --> 04:43.582
I'd pick you.

04:43.584 --> 04:46.418
That is...Incredibly obvious

04:46.420 --> 04:49.021
And incredibly accurate.

04:49.023 --> 04:51.757
Oh, come on!
Get a stairwell!

04:51.759 --> 04:53.659
Your timer.

04:53.661 --> 04:54.893
<i>Merci.</i>

05:01.267 --> 05:03.568
Just tell us who won.

05:03.570 --> 05:07.272
The winners are,
I am very happy to say...

05:07.274 --> 05:08.974
Max and deke.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.176
[both cheering]

05:11.178 --> 05:13.145
You were amazing!
I love you.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.247
I love you too.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.618
Wait, you do?

05:19.620 --> 05:22.954
Do you?

05:22.956 --> 05:25.924
Yeah...I do.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.860
Yeah, well, I do too,

05:28.862 --> 05:31.930
So suck on that.

05:38.604 --> 05:40.339
Okay, two important things.

05:40.341 --> 05:44.076
One, I'm the guy you've been
talking to on okcupid.

05:45.778 --> 05:48.547
And two, I need five minutes
of girl talk

05:48.549 --> 05:49.948
And not a minute more
because I'm worried

05:49.950 --> 05:52.150
It'll turn me into a girl.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.352
Go. Tell me.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.420
Leave nothing out,
leave everything in.

05:55.422 --> 05:58.790
I said something today
I never thought I'd say.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.393
"thank you"?

06:01.395 --> 06:04.296
I said "I love you"
to deke.

06:04.298 --> 06:06.565
He said, "I love you,"
and I said it back.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.801
Oh, cool.
Good for you.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.237
Wait, that's it?

06:12.239 --> 06:14.306
I finally decide to cave
and be a girl for you,

06:14.308 --> 06:15.974
And you hang me out to dry?

06:15.976 --> 06:17.442
I've seen movies.

06:17.444 --> 06:18.643
You're supposed
to jump around and say,

06:18.645 --> 06:21.380
"this calls
for a margarita!"

06:21.382 --> 06:23.782
This calls
for a margarita!

06:23.784 --> 06:25.784
Too much, too late.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.419
Your first reaction
said everything,

06:27.421 --> 06:29.721
And your second one
was just annoying.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.556
I'm sorry,
I just didn't think

06:31.558 --> 06:33.258
You were taking him
so seriously.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.493
He has no money.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.294
I mean, the man
lives in a dumpster.

06:36.296 --> 06:38.563
You are such a snob.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.966
It doesn't bother you
he has to move his house

06:40.968 --> 06:43.735
Every Tuesday
between 10:00 and 2:00?

06:45.638 --> 06:49.074
No, I've always wanted
to travel.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.510
[knocks on door]

06:51.512 --> 06:55.113
Come on, you can't really be
in love with him, right?

06:55.115 --> 06:57.315
I mean,
you can't love deke.

06:57.317 --> 07:01.219
Max, you're in love with that
cute mochaccino homeless guy

07:01.221 --> 07:04.689
With the jew-fro?

07:04.691 --> 07:07.859
He is not homeless.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.695
He lives in a beautifully
decorated dumpster.

07:10.697 --> 07:13.432
So homeless?

07:13.434 --> 07:15.167
I get it.

07:15.169 --> 07:17.102
You know,
I used to be engaged

07:17.104 --> 07:20.272
To a man who lived
in the sewers.

07:20.274 --> 07:23.341
Yeah, the heart wants
what it wants.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.877
Plus he told me
he was friends

07:25.879 --> 07:27.212
With the mutant ninja turtles,

07:27.214 --> 07:30.615
And they were
a huge deal at the time.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.118
At the time?

07:33.120 --> 07:36.087
If he can introduce me
to donatello, get him back.

07:36.089 --> 07:39.624
How did you know
you loved this...Sewer man?

07:39.626 --> 07:43.395
Well, he made me laugh.

07:43.397 --> 07:45.864
He was very passionate,

07:45.866 --> 07:49.634
And I wanted
to be with him constantly.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.938
Probably because he got me
hooked on heroin.

07:52.940 --> 07:56.041
That was a crazy summer.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.810
See?
I feel the same way.

07:58.812 --> 08:02.948
Minus the heroin part,
unfortunately.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.549
Can I use your bathroom?

08:04.551 --> 08:07.619
I have to tinkle,
and there's a wasp in mine.

08:07.621 --> 08:10.555
Go ahead, sophie.

08:11.691 --> 08:13.291
What's that look?

08:13.293 --> 08:14.893
Is the wasp behind me?

08:14.895 --> 08:17.329
I can't believe you.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.331
Even after three years
of being friends with me,

08:19.333 --> 08:21.333
You still have a thing
against poor people.

08:21.335 --> 08:24.469
Max, you love him,
I can love him.
[toilet flushes]

08:24.471 --> 08:26.137
I just have to get
to know him better.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.372
Invite me over
to the garbage can

08:27.374 --> 08:29.374
For a wine and cheese party.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.643
Wait a minute.
Wine and cheese party?

08:31.645 --> 08:34.246
Oh, I'm gonna bring
my new boy toy.

08:34.248 --> 08:38.950
He's the caesar salad pepperer
at the olive garden.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.654
No dates, sophie.

08:42.656 --> 08:43.989
The place is so small,

08:43.991 --> 08:46.258
I once accidentally took it home
in my purse.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.264
[sniffs]
mmm.

08:52.266 --> 08:53.832
This camembert
smells like feet,

08:53.834 --> 08:56.835
So you know it's good.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.937
Look at you,
mayor mccheese.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.405
So fancy.

09:00.407 --> 09:03.308
It's just the usual diner crew,
you know.

09:03.310 --> 09:07.012
We serve
imitation imitation crab.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.748
Well, I just wanted
to class the place up for you.

09:09.750 --> 09:14.252
You know, get some wine,
get some cheese, flush.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.820
You did not
need to do that.

09:15.822 --> 09:17.322
I love
that you live here.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.858
And if a dumpster was
good enough for me as a baby,

09:19.860 --> 09:21.960
It is still good enough for me
as an adult.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.629
Oh, you love
that I live here.

09:24.631 --> 09:26.998
Do you love anything else?

09:27.000 --> 09:29.034
Well, I loved
<i>the karate kid</i> movies

09:29.036 --> 09:33.004
Until will smith's kid
ruined them.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.773
Okay, can we please be serious
for a minute?

09:34.775 --> 09:36.641
Did you just say "I love you"
because I said it first?

09:36.643 --> 09:39.678
Look, honestly, yes.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.380
But I definitely meant it,
I think.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.616
Look, I suck at this stuff.

09:44.618 --> 09:47.018
This and not laughing
when kids fall.

09:49.622 --> 09:52.157
Just know that
if/when I say it again,

09:52.159 --> 09:53.325
I will mean it.

09:53.327 --> 09:56.061
I can totally wait--
I love you, max.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.462
Nice try, sneaky.

09:57.464 --> 09:59.564
[knocks on door]

09:59.566 --> 10:01.666
(max)
oh, hi. Come on in.

10:01.668 --> 10:04.569
And be nice.
Remember, you barely have a bed.

10:04.571 --> 10:07.305
Don't worry.
I love this area.

10:07.307 --> 10:10.141
I met your neighbor,
the mattress.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.210
Oh, that queen?

10:12.212 --> 10:15.347
So would you like a cabernet
or a shiraz?

10:15.349 --> 10:17.816
[chuckles]
shiraz.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.251
Oh, that's a real name?

10:20.253 --> 10:22.520
Oh, wow.

10:22.522 --> 10:24.823
Some interesting pairings here.

10:24.825 --> 10:27.225
In fact, I'm looking
at one as we speak.

10:27.227 --> 10:30.195
Please, someone else
come right now.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.897
[knocks on door]

10:32.899 --> 10:34.232
Hi, everyone!

10:34.234 --> 10:36.668
I'm here.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.603
Please, someone else
come right now.

10:38.605 --> 10:41.673
I brought some homemade
kimchi bin dae duk.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.208
Would you like to try it,

10:43.210 --> 10:46.011
Or should I just throw it
right into the garbage?

10:46.013 --> 10:49.614
It took me a year to get
this kind of smell out of here,

10:49.616 --> 10:52.350
But thanks, han.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.753
Oh, what a dump.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.021
[chuckles]

10:56.023 --> 10:58.923
I thought of that
on the way over.

10:58.925 --> 11:01.026
All right, let's do this.

11:01.028 --> 11:05.096
I'm ready to rage
all night, baby.

11:06.365 --> 11:08.099
Oh, hell no.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.935
I am too old for this.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.103
Sophie, watch your head.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.438
You might wanna
take your heels off.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.841
Take my heels off?

11:16.843 --> 11:22.013
Communist russia couldn't get me
to take my heels off.

11:22.015 --> 11:25.316
Hey, earl, you wanna go
get drunk somewhere

11:25.318 --> 11:29.187
We don't have to bend over
till we want to?

11:29.189 --> 11:32.257
Indeed, I do.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.696
Not to brag,
but I'm the only one

11:37.698 --> 11:41.299
Who can stand up in here.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.668
Cool brag, han.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.904
So, deke,
tell me about yourself.

11:45.906 --> 11:48.073
Hey, stop
guantanamo bay-ing him.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.075
Well, I go to pastry school,

11:50.077 --> 11:51.476
I live in a dumpster,

11:51.478 --> 11:53.244
And I was thrown out
of one direction

11:53.246 --> 11:54.412
For being too handsome.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.814
That's about it.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.148
There must be
more to you than that.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.550
I mean,
I'm surprised to see

11:58.552 --> 12:00.385
A roquefort cheese
paired with a 2001 syrah

12:00.387 --> 12:02.787
From the rhone region of France
at a dumpster party.

12:02.789 --> 12:03.888
Where'd you learn
about wine?

12:03.890 --> 12:05.657
Well, I wanted to impress you,

12:05.659 --> 12:09.227
And I keep my adult grape juice
game on point.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.596
So where are you
from originally?

12:11.598 --> 12:13.765
Did you grow up
in a storage facility or--

12:13.767 --> 12:15.467
Will you stop?

12:15.469 --> 12:18.103
He looks nervous like
the fat guy at a birthday party

12:18.105 --> 12:19.738
When he finds out
there's a pool.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.106
[knocks on door]

12:21.108 --> 12:24.442
(deke)
coming, coming.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.945
Good.
We have the right dumpster.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.314
I brought some wine.
Bebe brought cheese.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.815
Kind of.

12:30.817 --> 12:32.250
Hey, guys,
thanks for inviting me.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.518
Happy to be included.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.454
All right,
another babe.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.123
Throw your keys in the bowl.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.458
Right now,
it's just me and han, and...

12:40.460 --> 12:44.162
That ain't happening.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.364
What is nicolas doing here?
Hide me.

12:46.366 --> 12:50.034
I think you're gonna
run into him.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.036
Sorry, I thought
you were into him.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.171
I'm not into him.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.973
Please, caroline,
relax.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.541
It's just a party.
I'm here as a friend.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.576
Then where is your hand?

12:58.578 --> 13:01.246
On your beautiful bottom.

13:01.248 --> 13:02.413
Sorry, it's crowded.

13:02.415 --> 13:03.715
It was either there
or in the sink.

13:03.717 --> 13:05.416
Please remove it.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.185
I-I did.

13:07.187 --> 13:10.455
That one's mine, baby.

13:12.958 --> 13:17.462
Come on, it's 8:45,
and nobody's got their tops off.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.565
Somebody's gotta
do something.

13:20.567 --> 13:24.269
Oh, one time I played
seven minutes in heaven.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.371
Well, I got hit by a bus,

13:26.373 --> 13:28.439
And I was dead
for seven minutes.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.575
Bebe, do you want some wine?

13:30.577 --> 13:32.210
Sure, why not?

13:32.212 --> 13:33.578
I don't have anything
to do tomorrow

13:33.580 --> 13:35.413
Except move to canada.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.581
(all)
what?

13:36.583 --> 13:37.615
Yeah, no biggie.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.050
Long story short,

13:39.052 --> 13:41.920
They found me.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.589
Caroline, looks like
it's gonna be just you and me

13:44.591 --> 13:45.590
In the office.

13:45.592 --> 13:46.825
Nicolas, please.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.293
What did I tell you
about your hand?

13:48.295 --> 13:50.628
(han)
that's me!

13:50.630 --> 13:54.599
I was trying to push my way
to the cheese.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.801
Hey, bebe gun,
if you're ever in alberta,

13:56.803 --> 13:59.671
Hit the fairmont at banff--
super fun.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.507
I got wasted and cannonballed
into the lake there once.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.810
It was frozen.
Shattered my pelvis.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.378
Good times.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.913
Hey, I know that place.

14:08.915 --> 14:10.481
Fairmont chateau
on lake louise?

14:10.483 --> 14:11.850
We used to winter there.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.551
That's
a really exclusive resort.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.186
I once saw them tell
barbra streisand

14:15.188 --> 14:16.921
To take it
to the holiday inn.

14:16.923 --> 14:19.224
Caroline, you want
some of my triple creme?

14:19.226 --> 14:21.759
I don't want
any of your creme.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.328
You know what, it's getting
a little crowded in here.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.196
I'm just gonna slip out
without anyone noticing.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.332
Oh, excuse me.

14:27.334 --> 14:30.602
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me.

14:30.604 --> 14:32.871
(max)
wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.539
So...

14:34.541 --> 14:36.574
Deke--what do you think?
Do you like him now?

14:36.576 --> 14:38.276
Well, before tonight,

14:38.278 --> 14:39.744
I thought he was the guy
who walks around

14:39.746 --> 14:41.212
Singing
"when you're sliding into home

14:41.214 --> 14:43.348
And your shorts
are full of foam, diarrhea."

14:43.350 --> 14:45.850
Now I find out he knows
all about cheese

14:45.852 --> 14:48.086
And has been to
this massively expensive resort,

14:48.088 --> 14:50.288
So I'm even more confused.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.723
What's confusing?

14:51.725 --> 14:53.958
The foam is diarrhea.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.560
Caroline, wait.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.762
Let me walk with you.
No, no, no. I'm good.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.797
Please, at least take my scarf.
It's cold.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.933
No, I'm fine--

15:04.470 --> 15:06.537
Are you okay?
Here, let me help.
No, nicolas.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.840
I am not going
to be the other woman.

15:08.842 --> 15:11.142
Despite the fact that
I am literally lying in trash,

15:11.144 --> 15:13.077
I am not trashy.

15:16.682 --> 15:17.949
Caroline, listen.

15:17.951 --> 15:21.052
Things aren't always
what they seem.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.788
Just because that is garbage
on the outside

15:23.790 --> 15:24.956
Doesn't mean
that it cannot be

15:24.958 --> 15:26.457
A nice apartment
on the inside.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.726
Just because I'm married
on the outside

15:28.728 --> 15:31.462
Doesn't mean I'm married
on the inside.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.231
Life is complex.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.700
Your whole thesis is hinged
on the fact

15:35.702 --> 15:38.536
That I think that dumpster
is nice on the inside,

15:38.538 --> 15:41.239
Which I don't.
Good night.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.408
Oh, caroline--
nicolas, please don't beg.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.376
I just--
maybe another world,
another life.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.845
I want--
you can't leave
your wife for me.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.847
No, it's just--
seriously!
You don't have to say it.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.883
No, I do.

15:51.885 --> 15:54.452
You have a diaper
on your back.

15:56.088 --> 15:58.623
I am aware.

16:07.933 --> 16:09.300
What are you
working on there?

16:09.302 --> 16:11.235
Is that a family
having a picnic at a park?

16:11.237 --> 16:14.505
No,
it's the letter "g"!

16:14.507 --> 16:17.976
I haven't written anything
by hand since 1996.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.677
Well, my writing's
really good.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.680
I forge a lot of checks
and prescriptions.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.917
I'm kind of a famous doctor.

16:31.123 --> 16:32.857
You're really saying it.
That says, "I love you."

16:32.859 --> 16:37.862
No, it's khloe kardashian
windsurfing.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.931
Yes, deke, I love you.

16:42.134 --> 16:43.768
Oh, bebe.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.970
I wasn't expecting you today.
I thought you moved.

16:45.972 --> 16:46.971
I'm on my way.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.306
My car's outside,

16:48.308 --> 16:52.176
But I remembered I left
my medication here.

16:55.414 --> 16:59.417
Okay, now where's
the big one?

16:59.419 --> 17:01.019
Well, as long
as you're here,

17:01.021 --> 17:03.021
Could you show me where
the student financial files are?

17:03.023 --> 17:05.056
Sure, they're here
in this folder

17:05.058 --> 17:07.392
I've labeled "depressing."

17:07.394 --> 17:09.927
I wanna check deke's file
and see if he's on scholarship.

17:09.929 --> 17:12.063
He's definitely
not on scholarship.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.365
His family's super rich.
He's a bromberg.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.734
Wait, bebe.
Bromberg?

17:16.736 --> 17:19.070
I thought deke's last name
was just "berg."

17:19.072 --> 17:22.540
As in "ice" or "pitts."

17:22.542 --> 17:24.308
No, he just goes
by berg for short.

17:24.310 --> 17:28.479
You know, like me,
my full name is bebebebe.

17:30.816 --> 17:34.385
So you're telling me deke
is from the bromberg family,

17:34.387 --> 17:36.120
As in the bromberg elevators--

17:36.122 --> 17:38.723
The ones that are
in every building in the city?

17:38.725 --> 17:40.792
As in the bromberg
colo-rectal center

17:40.794 --> 17:42.226
At the new york hospital?

17:42.228 --> 17:44.128
Yeah.

17:44.130 --> 17:45.997
You know,
I once left a purse

17:45.999 --> 17:49.133
And 2 feet
of my large intestine there.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.569
Nice knowing you.
Bye.

17:55.874 --> 17:57.408
Ooh, I'll be right back.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.509
If you mess up our batter,

17:58.511 --> 18:00.912
I'll cut your thing off.

18:00.914 --> 18:04.415
Sweet, I could stand
to lose 5 pounds.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.719
I have some exciting news
to share.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.755
Unless it's about
an off-season shamrock shake,

18:10.757 --> 18:11.756
I don't care.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.592
Your deke--dumpster deke--

18:14.594 --> 18:16.894
Is actually deacon bromberg.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.063
Of the manhattan brombergs!
He's rich!

18:19.065 --> 18:20.865
What are you talking about?
That is crazy.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.567
I would know
if he were rich.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.669
I wouldn't have just told
a rich guy I love him.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.571
It's all right here.
Isn't this amazing?

18:26.573 --> 18:28.239
This is like

18:28.241 --> 18:29.340
Buying a dress you love

18:29.342 --> 18:31.476
And finding out it's rich.

18:37.683 --> 18:39.617
Whoa, why'd you do that?

18:39.619 --> 18:42.120
You're rich.
Max, wait.

18:42.122 --> 18:45.623
You pretended to be poor.
Liar.

18:47.192 --> 18:49.427
Ooh, lordy be.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.962
This kind of drama's
the reason

18:50.964 --> 18:53.865
Why I quit
the ohio state football team.

19:00.172 --> 19:01.672
Why are you so upset?

19:01.674 --> 19:04.976
Lying about being rich
is at most a little white lie.

19:04.978 --> 19:08.479
It is literally the whitest lie
I have ever heard,

19:08.481 --> 19:09.981
And it's a huge deal.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.282
I never would
have fallen in love

19:11.284 --> 19:12.550
With someone who has money.

19:12.552 --> 19:15.052
We are drastically,
massively,

19:15.054 --> 19:17.288
Monumentally different people.

19:17.290 --> 19:20.324
Hey, max, can we talk?
Oh, I don't know.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.393
Depends on
who I'm talking to.

19:22.395 --> 19:25.163
Am I talking to deke
or deacon bromberg,

19:25.165 --> 19:26.631
The elevator king?

19:26.633 --> 19:28.733
Man, if you're this upset
about the money,

19:28.735 --> 19:30.067
How are you gonna react
when you find out

19:30.069 --> 19:33.304
I'm really a woman?

19:33.306 --> 19:35.907
We wouldn't care.

19:35.909 --> 19:38.509
I never tell anybody
I'm rich

19:38.511 --> 19:40.144
Until after we say I love you

19:40.146 --> 19:42.647
Because I don't want money
to change anything.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.749
Money changes everything!

19:44.751 --> 19:46.017
Now excuse me.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.518
I gotta do my second job,

19:47.520 --> 19:49.187
Which you wouldn't
know anything about.

19:49.189 --> 19:52.023
Don't you have
an ascot convention to get to?

19:52.025 --> 19:54.258
<i>(deke)</i>
<i>still here.</i>

19:54.260 --> 19:56.994
Also, two customers
just showed up.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.663
We don't need their money!

19:58.665 --> 20:01.732
We're big, fat liars pretending
to be poor too.

20:01.734 --> 20:05.503
Mm, yeah,
my mom invented dogs.

20:05.505 --> 20:10.107
Any time someone buys a dog,
we get 10%!

20:10.109 --> 20:11.576
Now I can't believe it.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.878
Even after three years
with me as a friend,

20:13.880 --> 20:15.713
You still have a thing
against rich people.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.082
Mm-hmm, I do,
because rich people suck.

20:18.084 --> 20:19.417
They think
they're better than everyone

20:19.419 --> 20:20.785
And are generally sucky.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.221
So he has money,
I don't want it.

20:23.223 --> 20:26.190
Again, just wildly
different people.

20:26.192 --> 20:28.426
And, max, just because
he's rich on the outside

20:28.428 --> 20:30.795
Doesn't mean he's not like you
on the inside.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.396
Life is complex.

20:32.398 --> 20:33.731
[knocks on window]

20:33.733 --> 20:35.700
I don't wanna
see you right now!

20:35.702 --> 20:38.736
Hey!
I don't wanna see you either.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.538
Just toss me
something chocolate

20:40.540 --> 20:43.040
With some cream
in the middle.

20:43.042 --> 20:45.276
And speaking of cream
in the middle,

20:45.278 --> 20:50.047
Your little homeless boyfriend
is trying to get your attention.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.750
He's not homeless.
He's not my boyfriend.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.118
He's rich.

20:54.120 --> 20:57.154
Rich?
And he's single?

20:57.156 --> 20:58.389
[gasps]

20:58.391 --> 21:01.259
Oh, maybe I will
take off my heels.

21:06.198 --> 21:08.032
