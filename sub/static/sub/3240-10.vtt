09:34.675 --> 09:35.874
What is it?
A tuxedo.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.108
A tuxedo for what?

09:37.110 --> 09:39.344
Oh, mr. Cavendish
was getting married.

09:39.346 --> 09:42.614
The wedding registry --
it's on the second floor.

09:42.616 --> 09:46.484
Patricia:
I can't believe he's dead.

09:46.486 --> 09:50.088
Jo: Were you close
with the deceased?

09:50.090 --> 09:51.389
I wouldn't say close,

09:51.391 --> 09:53.358
Uh, but we worked
closely on the registry.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.594
You can get very friendly
with the couples.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.796
Can you tell us
about his fiancÃ©e?

09:57.798 --> 09:59.698
Of course.
Emily sontag.

09:59.700 --> 10:03.468
Her father owns garment
factories in new jersey.

10:03.470 --> 10:06.304
That's it.
They supply most
of our high-end designers.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.973
You have her contact info?

10:07.975 --> 10:10.108
Yes.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.444
I must have it somewhere.

10:15.514 --> 10:17.482
Hey.
Hello.

10:31.097 --> 10:32.530
You got a problem?

10:32.532 --> 10:36.067
I wondered if I could have
a closer look at your legs.

10:36.069 --> 10:40.071
Dude, even for new york,
you're a weirdo.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.272
Step back.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.074
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.943
Nypd.
What the hell is this?

10:44.945 --> 10:46.111
Look at his calf.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.079
It has the same
distinct scarring

10:48.081 --> 10:50.281
As the inside of colin's ankle.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.816
It's called a chain scar.

10:51.818 --> 10:55.153
You ride in the city all day,
every day, you get it.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.722
I believe colin
was a bike messenger.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.124
You recognize this guy?

10:59.126 --> 11:02.227
He would've had blond hair
when you knew him.

11:06.432 --> 11:08.900
Wow.
That's dwight.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.035
Dwight?

11:10.037 --> 11:11.002
Dwight dziak.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.203
We used to ride together.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.938
Haven't seen him
in like a year,

11:13.940 --> 11:16.574
But if you find him,
tell him he owes me money.

11:17.977 --> 11:19.444
[ inhales deeply ]

11:19.446 --> 11:22.514
I believe
we've found our noble.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.049
Dwight dziak.

11:24.051 --> 11:27.152
Sir dwight dziak.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.687
TouchÃ©.

11:33.259 --> 11:35.927
Ahh!
Your bernard weatherill.

11:35.929 --> 11:36.928
It looks splendid on you.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.229
You think?
Hmm.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.632
It doesn't make me look
like a bit of a dandy?

11:40.634 --> 11:43.568
You use that word
like it's a bad thing.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.704
When you wear
a savile row suit,

11:45.706 --> 11:47.072
You must exude confidence.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.707
Here.

11:48.709 --> 11:49.908
Ah!

11:49.910 --> 11:52.010
What's the big occasion?

11:52.012 --> 11:53.712
I'm going to a funeral.
Oh.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.381
No, it's a good one --
as far as they go.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.583
Oh, lyle ames
from the obituaries.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.618
But there are gonna be
a lot of people there

12:00.620 --> 12:02.754
That I haven't seen
in a very long time.

12:02.756 --> 12:03.788
Really?
Yeah.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.658
And by "people,"
you mean a woman.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.126
What's her name?

12:08.128 --> 12:10.228
[ chuckles ] fawn.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.996
When did you
see her last?

12:11.998 --> 12:14.232
The eisenhower
administration.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.367
She went to ps 6
with me and lyle.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.104
She was, um --
well, special.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.171
First love?

12:20.173 --> 12:22.774
Ah! How sweet.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.909
And uncharacteristically
innocent.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.912
You know, funerals, they're
the best places to meet ladies

12:27.914 --> 12:30.515
Of a certain age and,
uh, romantic temperament.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.217
That's the abe I know.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.319
Bingo.
Oh, could you come with me?

12:34.321 --> 12:37.322
I mean to the funeral.
I-I need a wingman.

12:37.324 --> 12:41.359
No, no, no, sh-sh-she's,
uh, I-important.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.661
I mean, uh, it's hard
for me to explain, but she is.

12:43.663 --> 12:46.898
And, uh, it's been 60 years,
and I'm just a little nervous,

12:46.900 --> 12:49.768
So I-I just want to make
a good impression, so...

12:49.770 --> 12:52.670
[ clears throat ]
staid and dependable?

12:52.672 --> 12:55.406
Or, uh,
wild and spontaneous?

12:55.408 --> 12:58.543
Why don't you just try
being yourself, hmm?

12:58.545 --> 13:00.879
It's always worked
out best.

13:00.881 --> 13:01.913
Okay, great.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.448
And who is that?

13:05.384 --> 13:07.619
Reece:
So, who is dwight dziak?

13:07.621 --> 13:09.420
He's 27 years old,
born in oklahoma,

13:09.422 --> 13:11.756
And his juvenile search record
turned up a few hits.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.658
Case file reads like
a dickens' novel.

13:13.660 --> 13:15.727
Guy bounced around
from various foster homes

13:15.729 --> 13:17.562
Before striking out
to the big apple

13:17.564 --> 13:18.763
To become a bike messenger.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.832
Only 14 months later,
he quits,

13:20.834 --> 13:22.834
Drops off the grid
completely.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.669
What about the fiancÃ©e?
What's her story?

13:24.671 --> 13:26.538
Emily sontag should be here
any minute,

13:26.540 --> 13:27.839
Coming in
from westchester.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.541
Her father owns
a textile factory.

13:29.543 --> 13:31.643
The point is,
emily comes from a family

13:31.645 --> 13:34.045
That a bike messenger
doesn't marry into easily.

13:34.047 --> 13:37.382
So maybe emily helps dziak
come up with his bs bio

13:37.384 --> 13:39.684
To pull the wool
over daddy's eyes?

13:39.686 --> 13:41.452
Yeah, we'll let you know
what we get out of her.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.924
[ sighs ]
this isn't real.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.126
[ sniffles ]
um...

13:48.128 --> 13:49.994
I'm sorry.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.196
How does this happen?

13:51.198 --> 13:53.298
Who would want to murder colin?

13:53.300 --> 13:54.799
Hoping you could help us
with that.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.968
When did you last
see colin?

13:56.970 --> 13:58.369
Before I went to sleep.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.205
When I woke up, he was gone.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.706
You never left
your apartment?

14:01.708 --> 14:04.008
You have somebody
who can back that up?

14:04.010 --> 14:05.844
The doorman to our building.

14:05.846 --> 14:08.613
You know, we're having
a little bit of trouble

14:08.615 --> 14:10.949
Locating your fiancÃ©'s
next of kin.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.283
Colin was english.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.252
He doesn't have any family
in the states.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.587
Um...
[ sniffles ]

14:15.589 --> 14:17.021
Maybe you could try
the british embassy?

14:18.324 --> 14:21.359
Did you ever hear
the name dwight dziak?

14:22.828 --> 14:24.295
Why? [ sniffles ]

14:24.297 --> 14:25.563
Is that -- is he a suspect?

14:25.565 --> 14:27.498
Is that who you think
killed colin?

14:28.467 --> 14:30.802
Um...Emily,
this is gonna be hard,

14:30.804 --> 14:31.903
Especially on top

14:31.905 --> 14:34.372
Of all that you're
going through right now.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.742
We have to tell you something
about your fiancÃ©.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.378
Colin wasn't
who he said he was.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.248
What are you talking about?

14:43.250 --> 14:46.451
Emily, meet your fiancÃ©,
dwight dziak.

14:52.858 --> 14:54.058
Lucas: Hey, doc.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.661
I was gonna put him on ice
if that was okay with you?

14:56.663 --> 14:57.862
Yes, I believe
we've learned all we can

14:57.864 --> 14:59.063
From his body
for the moment.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.899
It's a funny thing, huh,

15:00.901 --> 15:04.769
Just pretending to be
someone you're not?

15:07.072 --> 15:09.540
I was in the ninth grade,
and I had to switch schools.

15:09.542 --> 15:13.945
For a whole year, I made
my classmates call me fernando.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.947
Uh, well, what happened?

15:15.949 --> 15:18.616
Well, eventually
I got tired of worrying

15:18.618 --> 15:21.519
That my old life
would catch up with the new.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.788
And I didn't speak spanish.

15:23.790 --> 15:27.659
Yeah, can't imagine
what it was like

15:27.661 --> 15:30.862
For this guy always checking
over his shoulder.

15:30.864 --> 15:32.497
Crazy.

15:35.467 --> 15:37.435
[ breathes deeply ]

15:37.437 --> 15:39.771
Never could tire of this.

15:39.773 --> 15:40.872
What's that?

15:40.874 --> 15:43.908
Seasons changing,
nature's cycle of life.

15:43.910 --> 15:46.544
Mm, all of us
one year older --

15:46.546 --> 15:49.013
Even you, darling.

15:49.015 --> 15:51.282
Your gray hair is flaking
on your shoulder.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.450
[ both chuckle ]

15:52.452 --> 15:53.851
I have to start
wearing a hat.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.887
Oh, don't worry.
No one saw a thing.

15:55.889 --> 15:58.056
I need to pick up abe
from school.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.624
See you at home.
Bye.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.701
Dr. Henry morgan.

16:12.604 --> 16:13.738
I thought it was you.

16:13.740 --> 16:17.208
I saw you hit
by an artillery shell

16:17.210 --> 16:19.344
On the beach at normandy.

16:19.346 --> 16:22.213
What,
don't you recognize me?

16:22.215 --> 16:23.381
Pfc hemecker.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.183
I know time hasn't been
as kind to me

16:25.185 --> 16:26.751
As it's been to you,
doctor.

16:26.753 --> 16:29.687
I got a piece of that same shell
in this old leg of mine.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.856
[ american accent ]
uh, you got the wrong guy.

16:31.858 --> 16:34.759
Now, excuse me.
I have to get back to work.

16:34.761 --> 16:38.629
I got to say, I have seen
my share of ghosts,

16:38.631 --> 16:40.898
But none as real as you!

16:41.800 --> 16:43.101
Lucas: Henry?

16:43.103 --> 16:45.003
Henry.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.037
Or dr. Morgan,

16:46.039 --> 16:48.806
Unless we're finally
on a first-name basis?

16:50.042 --> 16:50.975
Didn't think so.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.176
What is it, lucas?

16:52.178 --> 16:55.113
Ah, well, when I was gonna go
pack up his stuff,

16:55.115 --> 16:58.082
I felt something crinkly
inside his coat pocket.

16:58.084 --> 17:01.052
And turned out it was paper,
but just a bunch of pieces,

17:01.054 --> 17:03.287
So I put what I could
back together.

17:03.289 --> 17:04.655
Look at that.

17:04.657 --> 17:05.723
A check!
Oh, yeah.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.125
It's a lot of zeroes.

17:07.127 --> 17:10.194
Yeah, a cool million,
payable to the d.O.A.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.529
From whose account?

17:11.531 --> 17:13.798
One norman sontag.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.634
Colin's would-be
father-in-law.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.970
Jo: Ms. Sontag, did you know
about the check

17:18.972 --> 17:21.773
Your father wrote colin
the night he was murdered?

17:21.775 --> 17:24.776
It was for our wedding --

17:24.778 --> 17:26.778
Colin's family's castle
in devonshire...

17:26.780 --> 17:27.979
[ chuckles ruefully ]

17:27.981 --> 17:29.680
...Which was obviously
made up, too.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.649
You must think
I'm an idiot.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.352
I think that you just fell
for the wrong man.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.754
Of everything
you've told me,

17:36.756 --> 17:40.958
The fact our love wasn't real
is the hardest to believe.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.194
Hanson:
You buying this story?

17:43.196 --> 17:45.596
I'll subpoena her
building's security footage

17:45.598 --> 17:46.764
And talk to her doorman,

17:46.766 --> 17:48.599
But I don't make her
for a killer.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.401
Now, her old man,
on the other hand...

17:50.403 --> 17:51.936
Forget about the money.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.905
Daddies don't like to see their
little girl's hearts broken.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.139
And you think norman sontag

17:55.141 --> 17:57.075
Found out his daughter
was being duped?

17:57.077 --> 17:59.710
Talk to him.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.814
Wow. Nice digs.

18:02.816 --> 18:06.050
Looks like it belongs
on the other side of the pond.

18:06.052 --> 18:07.618
Remind you of home?

18:07.620 --> 18:10.254
What?
You think all englishmen

18:10.256 --> 18:12.690
Grew up reciting poetry
and hunting pheasants?

18:12.692 --> 18:14.125
[ chuckles ]
well, it's just

18:14.127 --> 18:16.127
You never talk about
where you grew up.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.596
Then colin cavendish and I
have something in common --

18:18.598 --> 18:20.131
The need
to reinvent ourselves.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.133
Well, there's no better place
than here in america.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.635
We've got no shortage
of suckers.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.939
You think that's what was
motivating our victim --

18:27.941 --> 18:30.174
A confidence game
driven by greed?

18:30.176 --> 18:33.177
The guy had a million bucks
in his pocket.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.378
That he'd torn up.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.981
What if he was just a man
trying to escape his past?

18:36.983 --> 18:38.749
Dwight lied
about who he was.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.551
Because he aspired to be
someone better,

18:40.553 --> 18:42.086
Then fell in love
with someone better.

18:42.088 --> 18:44.021
Haven't you ever wanted to be
someone else?

18:44.023 --> 18:49.026
Nope. For better or worse,
I know who I am.

18:49.028 --> 18:51.762
My daughter's happiness is all
that ever mattered to me.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.798
Then some sociopath
comes into her life,

18:53.800 --> 18:55.366
Preying on an innocent girl.

18:55.368 --> 18:58.703
When's the last time you saw
your daughter's fiancÃ©?

18:58.705 --> 19:01.572
Was the, uh, night
of the engagement party --

19:01.574 --> 19:03.774
Uh, when it ended,
at about 10:00.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.843
Is your back all right?

19:05.845 --> 19:07.612
The way you're walking --
slight limp.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.447
Heat pad over there.

19:09.449 --> 19:12.216
I threw it out playing golf.

19:12.218 --> 19:13.718
Ice...

19:13.720 --> 19:16.020
Much better than heat
for a muscle strain.

19:16.022 --> 19:19.657
Did you notice anything odd
about colin's behavior

19:19.659 --> 19:21.325
The night you saw him?

19:21.327 --> 19:22.960
Seemed happy as a clam to me.

19:22.962 --> 19:26.631
'course he had a check in his
pocket for a million bucks.

19:27.399 --> 19:30.301
[ sniffs deeply ]

19:30.303 --> 19:34.338
Dwight, or colin --
whichever you prefer --

19:34.340 --> 19:37.875
Came back here
after the party, didn't he?

19:37.877 --> 19:39.911
I'm curious what the two
of you discussed.

19:39.913 --> 19:42.346
I already told you
the engagement party

19:42.348 --> 19:46.484
Was the last time I saw that
lying okie son of a bitch.

19:46.486 --> 19:47.852
We never told you

19:47.854 --> 19:51.556
Where the viscount cavendish
really came from.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.958
Emily told me...

19:53.960 --> 19:56.527
On the phone when she called
to say that he was dead.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.196
We never told emily.

19:59.097 --> 20:01.632
Dwight dziak returned here
after the party,

20:01.634 --> 20:03.901
And you two had some
sort of altercation.

20:03.903 --> 20:07.004
That's why
his jacket was torn.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.307
I'd have to take it back
to my lab,

20:09.309 --> 20:12.476
But I'd wager that these
exquisite wool fibers

20:12.478 --> 20:13.844
Match dwight's suit.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.714
You shoved him up
against the wall, I assume.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.449
But he was strong,
a bike messenger,

20:18.451 --> 20:19.817
So he shoved you back.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.986
You fell onto the desk,
injuring your lower back.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.121
Marks on the carpet
where it moved slightly.

20:24.123 --> 20:25.790
You were no match for him
physically,

20:25.792 --> 20:28.359
But you couldn't let him leave,
so what was handy?

20:28.361 --> 20:31.929
Judging by the angle
of the injury on dwight's head,

20:31.931 --> 20:34.699
I'd say you used a 7-iron,
or perhaps a 6-.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.902
But you didn't catch him
clean -- a bit of a slice.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.471
You need more
shoulder rotation.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.572
H-henry, your gloves.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.940
Doesn't matter.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.142
It's already been wiped clean
of any evidence.

20:45.144 --> 20:47.912
Some sort of astringent
cleaning fluid.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.480
Next time use salt water --

20:49.482 --> 20:52.717
Just as effective
at removing blood and no odor.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.285
You followed dwight
to the city,

20:54.287 --> 20:56.587
And you stabbed him
in the neck at the fountain.

20:56.589 --> 20:57.955
Is that true?

20:59.691 --> 21:02.226
I am going to need
to talk to my lawyer.

21:02.228 --> 21:05.329
Well, that's the first
truthful statement

21:05.331 --> 21:07.098
You've made, mr. Sontag.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.807
I'm peter guzik,
mr. Sontag's counsel.

This is
my client's statement

Regarding the night
in question.

21:22.180 --> 21:24.582
Hanson: Try seeing this
from our perspective.

21:24.584 --> 21:28.352
Mr. Sontag admitted
that he attacked dwight dziak

21:28.354 --> 21:31.722
With a golf club,
but denies killing him?

21:31.724 --> 21:33.491
Yeah, that's a tough needle
to thread.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.592

21:34.594 --> 21:35.926
Good luck doing it
with a jury.

21:35.928 --> 21:38.329
What kind of a lawyer
are you, anyway?

21:38.331 --> 21:41.666
A corporate attorney for
mr. Sontag's textile business.

21:41.668 --> 21:44.168
It says here
your client called you

21:44.170 --> 21:47.071
After he assaulted dwight
at his house.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.706
Now, I don't speak legalese,

21:48.708 --> 21:51.242
But it sounds to me like you
told him to cover his tracks.

21:51.244 --> 21:52.476
Is that true?

21:52.478 --> 21:56.080
In general, innocent people
don't cover their tracks.

21:57.349 --> 21:59.617
What is it you want to know?
Mr. Sontag.

21:59.619 --> 22:02.787
Peter.
You've helped enough.

what happened that night

After the party.

Colin -- [ sighs ]

22:08.961 --> 22:11.629
Dwight, or whatever the hell
his name is,

22:11.631 --> 22:15.933
He came to the house,
said that he wanted to talk.

22:15.935 --> 22:19.704
Told me that everything
about him was bs,

22:19.706 --> 22:21.772
Dropped the stupid
british accent.

22:21.774 --> 22:26.444
Told me that it was all some
kind of con to steal my money,

22:26.446 --> 22:31.048
Except he had fallen
in love with emily

22:31.050 --> 22:34.118
And now all he wanted was her.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.953
So you assaulted him?

22:35.955 --> 22:38.589
He told me that he was going
to tell her the truth

22:38.591 --> 22:42.259
And that, if she forgave him,
that he would run away with her.

22:42.261 --> 22:43.461
Mr. Sontag did

22:43.463 --> 22:45.863
What any loving and
protective father would do.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.599
But we're talking
about assault, not murder.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.000
It's the god's honest truth.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.669
When he left my house,
he was alive.

22:51.671 --> 22:53.504
So, then what?

22:53.506 --> 22:55.072
In accordance with the advice
of my counsel,

22:55.074 --> 22:57.675
I did what I do every morning --
I went into work.

22:57.677 --> 23:00.544
Someone that could put you there
at 5:00 in the morning?

23:00.546 --> 23:02.179
About a hundred employees.

23:02.181 --> 23:04.148
And there's security footage.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.117
I'm sure my attorney
would be happy

23:06.119 --> 23:08.119
To get that for you if you want.

23:09.421 --> 23:13.724
The injury from norman sontag's
7-iron was inflicted

23:13.726 --> 23:16.293
Hours before dwight
was killed,

23:16.295 --> 23:19.964
Judging by the inflammatory
response...

23:21.600 --> 23:23.901
...Which also hid this.

23:28.306 --> 23:30.474
Gauze fiber...

23:30.476 --> 23:33.711
Hidden in the wound,
blended into his hair.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.146
[ sighs ]

23:35.148 --> 23:37.548
It appears that dwight's injury
was cared for.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.450
So maybe dwight
stopped by a pharmacy

23:39.452 --> 23:41.919
After norman hit him,
but before he was killed?

23:41.921 --> 23:43.888
Well, given the location
of dwight's injury,

23:43.890 --> 23:45.356
It would've been difficult
for him

23:45.358 --> 23:46.924
To accomplish that
by himself.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.526
Hmm, someone
could've helped him, then.

23:48.528 --> 23:50.327
Perhaps.

23:50.329 --> 23:53.297
Or just maybe
he had help all along.

and refinement

In a matter of months?

24:02.508 --> 24:03.607
The internet?

24:03.609 --> 24:04.975
Well, not likely.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.610
I mean, he knew how to speak,
how to act,

24:06.612 --> 24:08.712

24:08.714 --> 24:10.614

of a paul stuart catalog.

know what to buy,

24:36.476 --> 24:38.342
But have the money
to afford it?

who bought them.

that I dug out of colin's neck?

our murder weapon.

that colin cavendish purchased

he was using.

she called in sick today.

dwight's nursemaid

25:50.316 --> 25:51.916
Preformed the triage.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.586
But then I think
dwight betrayed her.

25:55.588 --> 25:58.155
You see, they were partners,
con artists,

25:58.157 --> 26:00.491
But dwight developed
a conscience.

26:09.935 --> 26:13.203
A piece
of norman sontag's check.

26:13.205 --> 26:14.572
So patricia killed him

26:14.574 --> 26:16.273
Because he wouldn't make off
with their money.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.642
No, that's not what their fight
was really about.

26:18.644 --> 26:20.477

musical-theater days,

26:20.479 --> 26:22.212
You mentioned
"my fair lady"?

26:22.214 --> 26:24.882
It's based on the myth
of pygmalion,

Abraham, I just buried
my husband two days ago.

No, no, I just meant,
um, a coffee.

The last time
it was a milkshake,
