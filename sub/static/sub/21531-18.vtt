WEBVTT

00:04.138 --> 00:06.407
(Jack)
Elizabeth!

00:06.507 --> 00:08.109
Do you
or do you not know

00:08.209 --> 00:11.145
how my Matthew McConaghey
mug works?

00:11.245 --> 00:12.746
When you fill it with coffee,

00:12.846 --> 00:14.682
his shirt disappears.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.518
And what happens when the
coffee's gone?

00:17.618 --> 00:20.088
His shirt comes back on.

00:20.188 --> 00:21.255
Exactly.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.590
Now if I wanted to see

00:22.690 --> 00:23.591
Matthew McConaghey
with his shirt on,

00:23.691 --> 00:24.792
I'd look at Josh Lucas.

00:24.892 --> 00:30.131
Now get out of my sight,
Elizabeth!

00:30.231 --> 00:32.066
Hi, Elizabeth.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.801
So, uh,
ready for lunch?

00:33.901 --> 00:35.536
I made a reservation
at that place in Chelsea

00:35.636 --> 00:38.439
with the crayons
and the leather placemats.

00:38.539 --> 00:42.143
Oh, that's my favorite
family S&M restaurant.

00:43.477 --> 00:44.645
But I can't.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.647
I have to prepare for my
interview today

00:46.747 --> 00:48.816
with Star Trek's
George Takei.

00:48.916 --> 00:51.152
Sulu?

00:51.252 --> 00:53.621
Lieutenant Sulu
is going to be on Jack Talk?

00:53.721 --> 00:55.356
He is such
an inspiration!

00:55.456 --> 00:57.191
Coming out the way he did?

00:57.291 --> 00:58.359
And I was always a fan.

00:58.459 --> 00:59.427
I mean,
I wasn't a Trekkie.

00:59.527 --> 01:02.430
That's...
that's geeky.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.832
I was a Sulu-head.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.600
An elite subset
of soon-to-be gay men

01:06.700 --> 01:08.169
who sensed at an early age

01:08.269 --> 01:09.203
a kinship
with the character Sulu,

01:09.303 --> 01:10.504
based on his sensitivity

01:10.604 --> 01:13.741
and lingering looks
at Captain Kirk.

01:15.443 --> 01:16.710
There he is.

01:16.810 --> 01:20.080
The queen of late night,
Jack McForeman.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.583
That's not right,
is it?

01:22.683 --> 01:24.218
Anyway,
big celeb today, huh?

01:24.318 --> 01:27.188
George Hosato Takei,
TV's Hikaru Sulu.

01:27.288 --> 01:30.258
You can get all that,
but you can't get McFarland?

01:30.358 --> 01:32.760
Look, Jack.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.696
Out TV was bought
by a large corporation.
What?

01:35.796 --> 01:37.298
All you gotta know is,

01:38.499 --> 01:39.467
it's not going to effect
Jack Talk in any way.

01:39.500 --> 01:39.833
You feelin' me?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.269
Yes, Jamie.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.103
No, you're not.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.272
And I told you,
you can,

01:44.372 --> 01:47.208
because my boyfriend's
cool with it.

01:47.308 --> 01:51.245
I could put sexual harassment
lawsuit flyers in this lobby

01:51.345 --> 01:52.680
and retire.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.716
All right.
I'll see you later, Jack.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.518
Oh, uh, one little change.

01:57.618 --> 01:58.719
You're getting a cohost.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.888
I can't believe this.

02:00.988 --> 02:03.457
My contract specifically says
"no cohost."

02:03.557 --> 02:06.760
Uh...actually, Jack,
it said "no Ho-Hos."

02:06.860 --> 02:08.162
Relax, blue eyes.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.431
This is just to widen
our audience, you know?

02:10.531 --> 02:11.765
Get a fresh point of view.

02:11.865 --> 02:15.436
Well, this cohost better not
steal focus from me.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.571
I want a real toad.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.640
And Ed McMahon.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.775
Hi!

02:21.875 --> 02:23.177
I'm Amber Louise,

02:23.277 --> 02:25.379
from the great state
of Alabama.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.380
Oh!

02:26.480 --> 02:28.916
Even better,
a British woman.

02:43.564 --> 02:46.867
Oh God!
You made me look so slutty.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.703
Nice job.

02:49.803 --> 02:53.407
Thanks.
My roommate's a drag queen.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.710
Don't judge me.
I just do his face.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.312
I don't tuck it in
or anything.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.954
So--so what do you want?
Lipstick, mascara...

03:07.054 --> 03:08.922
Oh, no, I'm not going to be
buying any makeup today.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.658
I don't really need it.

03:10.758 --> 03:13.761
I'm pregnant,
so I have a natural glow.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.729
Wow.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.965
It took a lot of balls
to say that.

03:21.969 --> 03:22.970
Hi, Grace.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.805
[gasps]
Wow.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.206
Look at you.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.308
You know,

03:27.408 --> 03:28.676
most girls who are

03:28.776 --> 03:32.746
knocked up and abandoned
by the love of their life

03:32.846 --> 03:35.283
get a little down.

03:35.383 --> 03:36.550
But you--

03:36.650 --> 03:38.652
You just keep
piling on that makeup

03:38.752 --> 03:39.987
as if you actually believe

03:41.121 --> 03:42.490
that anybody's ever going to
find you attractive again.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.761
I applaud your pluck.

03:47.861 --> 03:52.533
I am just so excited
about having this baby.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.735
To have someone to love

03:54.835 --> 03:56.670
and take care of
for the rest of my life.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.506
That is so...

03:58.606 --> 04:00.341
so cool.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.375
Wow.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.644
Well, Grace,
when you--

04:03.744 --> 04:06.013
when you say it
like that, it...

04:06.113 --> 04:09.683
kind of makes me want to
get one of those things.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.720
Hey.

04:12.820 --> 04:13.954
I'm going to do it.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.457
I'm going to get a baby.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.458
Great.

04:17.558 --> 04:18.859
You go and get a baby.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.027
Just remember, though.

04:20.127 --> 04:22.696
If it's in a stroller,
it's taken.

04:22.796 --> 04:23.797
Okay, I'm going to
run upstairs

04:23.897 --> 04:24.898
and get some giant bras.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.000
Or as the rest of the world
calls it,

04:27.034 --> 04:28.035
B cups.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.904
Excuse me.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.005
Cricket.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.844
Could I pay you
to have a baby for me?

04:36.944 --> 04:37.978
What?
No.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.781
Having a baby is one of
nature's most sacred miracles.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.583
You can't put
a price tag on that.

04:42.683 --> 04:43.784
A hundred grand,

04:44.785 --> 04:46.454
and I'll throw in a tummy tuck
after you pop.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.788
Mary Jane,
cover for me.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.757
I'm going on
maternity leave.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.395
This is so exciting.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.664
I haven't been on TV
since I was a little girl.

04:56.764 --> 04:59.833
And that was because
our neighbor shot his wife.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.302
It was so sad.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.971
But since she was dead,
and he was on trial,

05:04.071 --> 05:07.741
I got to use their pool
for two whole summers.

05:07.841 --> 05:13.581
And that is what Jack Talk
is all about, Amber Louise.

05:13.681 --> 05:14.682
Silver linings.

05:14.782 --> 05:15.816
Come on,
let's sit down.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.418
Now,

05:17.518 --> 05:18.852
If you're going to be
my cohost,

05:18.952 --> 05:21.088
you're going to learn how to
keep up, all right?

05:21.188 --> 05:23.857
Because during the show,

05:23.957 --> 05:25.693
it gets cah-razy in here.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.928
I jump around,
I make puns,

05:28.028 --> 05:30.330
I even rhyme words.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.067
It's insane.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.437
Rain.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.372
Jack, you're on
in five minutes.

05:38.472 --> 05:39.907
And I couldn't find
your Matthew McConaughey mug.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.975
Well, find it,
Elizabeth Ann.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.012
My name's Dave.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.080
And I'm not gay at all.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.449
Like, at all.

05:49.883 --> 05:50.884
Hey.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.486
Back in your cage,
straight-y.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.457
Hey, Jack.
Is George Takei here yet?

05:56.557 --> 05:57.891
I want him to sign his doll.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.395
He, uh, started making these
after he came out of the closet.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.730
Listen to this.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.767
(doll)
Beam me down, Scotty.
I'm going shopping.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.003
It's pretty cool, huh?

06:10.103 --> 06:11.472
He also says,

06:12.540 --> 06:13.841
[as George Takei]
"This planet
has breathable air.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.776
And Gucci."

06:15.876 --> 06:17.144
Now.

06:17.244 --> 06:18.746
We're ready to bring out
George Takei.

06:18.846 --> 06:19.847
Fun fact:

06:19.947 --> 06:22.916
What he's wearing today
is ugly.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.786
Jack, wait.

06:25.886 --> 06:26.887
That Star Wars guy?

06:26.987 --> 06:28.756
He got pushed
to tomorrow's show.

06:28.856 --> 06:31.759
Oh.
[nervous laugh]

06:31.859 --> 06:32.960
Well, you know what they say.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.795
Queer Takei,
on tomorrow.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.532
Why wasn't I told about this?

06:38.632 --> 06:41.635
Well, instead,
our parent company thought

06:41.735 --> 06:43.704
I should try
a segment of my own.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.640
And I call it
Amber Louise's Musings.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.942
And today's topic is,

06:49.042 --> 06:50.944
if you question our president,

06:51.044 --> 06:53.413
then you're a dirty traitor!

06:56.183 --> 06:59.753
Stars and dykes forever.
Where did this come from?

07:01.188 --> 07:03.891
What the hell
was that?

07:03.991 --> 07:06.159
Jamie, exactly who
bought Out TV?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.061
Nimbus Television Networks.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.930
Which is owned by
Digicity Global Worldwide.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.832
Which is a division

07:11.932 --> 07:14.735
of the Department
of Homeland Security.

07:14.835 --> 07:18.906
Which I believe
is owned by Nabisco.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.476
Cookies and
the Bush administration.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.111
The gay community's
two worst enemies

07:24.211 --> 07:27.681
have joined forces
to bring us down.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.452
Well, Cricket.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.522
It looks like
you're in perfect shape

07:34.622 --> 07:36.590
to be my surrogate.

07:36.690 --> 07:40.928
Oh, you sailed right through
the breast exam.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.095
Yeah, about that.

07:42.195 --> 07:45.733
Shouldn't a doctor
have done it?

07:47.067 --> 07:48.135
Why?

07:48.235 --> 07:52.039
So you can
squirm away from him too?

07:52.139 --> 07:53.574
(Grace)
Karen?

07:53.674 --> 07:54.775
What is this
surrogate contract

07:54.875 --> 07:56.043
you asked Will
to draw up for you?

07:56.143 --> 07:56.877
Wait a minute.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.879
What is the makeup lady
doing here?

07:58.979 --> 08:02.015
I didn't take the lipstick,
it just fell into my purse.

08:02.115 --> 08:05.819
She's my surrogate.
Isn't it a hoot?

08:07.320 --> 08:08.989
And I have a name,
by the way.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.658
It's Cricket Walker.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.594
Karen.
You cannot just--

08:13.694 --> 08:15.128
Wait a minute.
You took Karen's name?

08:15.228 --> 08:18.899
Well, we are
having a baby together.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.502
I'm a little old-fashioned.

08:22.603 --> 08:23.904
[bells jingling]

08:24.004 --> 08:27.675
You rang?

08:27.775 --> 08:30.143
Yes, Lurch.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.848
Cricket here
will be staying with us.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.884
Please arrange for
a closet of clothes,

08:36.984 --> 08:38.518
her favorite foods,

08:38.619 --> 08:41.555
and the implantation
of her tracking chip.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.561
Is this bitch for real?

08:47.661 --> 08:48.962
Hey.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.298
That bitch is the reason
I have a home.

08:51.398 --> 08:55.636
And $2 million in a trust fund
I get when I turn 35.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.273
Karen, this is insane.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.611
And I say that as a friend.

09:03.711 --> 09:07.881
Not one of the demon voices
that guides you.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.921
How dare you judge me?

09:14.021 --> 09:16.056
You got pregnant

09:16.156 --> 09:18.258
by your ex-husband
on an airplane,

09:18.358 --> 09:20.928
and you haven't even
told him yet.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.964
You just don't want
anybody else to have a baby

09:24.064 --> 09:25.833
because you want
all the attention.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.035
Oh, oh.
Okay.

09:28.135 --> 09:30.938
Wow.
That's what this is all about.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.974
Because I'm having a baby,
you have to have one too.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.242
You're jealous.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.710
That's absurd.

09:36.810 --> 09:37.811
You know,

09:37.911 --> 09:39.747
most women
would be thrilled

09:39.847 --> 09:41.314
to be pregnant
at the same time

09:41.414 --> 09:44.652
as their best friend's
cosmetic counter surrogate.

09:47.220 --> 09:50.090
Maybe you're just jealous

09:50.190 --> 09:52.059
because you're only
getting a baby,

09:52.159 --> 09:55.062
but I'm getting a baby
and a free makeup tote!

10:03.003 --> 10:05.773
What was Amber Louise doing
on the show today?

10:05.873 --> 10:07.107
That song-and-dance number

10:07.207 --> 10:09.009
attacking Hillary Clinton's
legislative record?

10:09.109 --> 10:11.278
[exhales]
Pretty controversial.

10:11.378 --> 10:12.312
I mean, this move?

10:17.317 --> 10:19.787
So '80s.
We are going to get letters.

10:19.887 --> 10:20.988
Jack.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.323
Out TV was bought by
right-wing conservatives.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.058
Amber Louise
is just a mouthpiece

10:25.158 --> 10:26.827
for your new bosses.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.797
You know, I kind of figured
that's how she got the job.

10:29.897 --> 10:30.931
But I didn't want to
say anything.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.299
'Cause, you know,
glass houses.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.906
They are using your show
to push their agenda.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.674
I mean, even your
studio audience is changing.

10:40.774 --> 10:45.145
There were people out there
with mullets.

10:45.245 --> 10:49.983
And they
weren't even lesbians!

10:50.083 --> 10:52.052
Jamie.
Is this true?

10:52.152 --> 10:54.755
You bet, Jack--
now you get on board,

10:54.855 --> 10:56.389
or there's going to be
serious ramifications.

10:56.489 --> 11:01.394
Oh.
Doesn't mean
what you think.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.731
Well, I'm not
changing my show.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.433
I'm not going to let it be
some platform

11:06.533 --> 11:08.301
for spewing left-wing--
Right-wing.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.171
right-wing garbage
that pushes a Democratic--
Republican.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.140
Republican magenta.

11:17.745 --> 11:20.380
Agenda.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.915
And good.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.250
I'm glad you're
not compromising.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.352
I'd hate to see you
roll over and take it.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.854
Again, doesn't mean
what you think.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.857
Oh.

11:29.957 --> 11:30.958
(Amber Louise)
Hey, Jack.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.025
I was wondering,

11:32.125 --> 11:33.026
maybe during interviews

11:33.126 --> 11:34.862
I could ask people
really tough questions.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.163
Not that I'm going to
bother them

11:36.263 --> 11:38.265
or torture them
or anything--

11:38.365 --> 11:39.800
Not that I'm
totally against torture.

11:39.900 --> 11:40.968
You know, sometimes
it's the only way

11:41.068 --> 11:43.904
to get
reliable information.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.338
Forget it, A.L.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.940
No changes.

11:47.040 --> 11:47.875
Jack Talk will remain

11:47.975 --> 11:50.077
the beacon of integrity
it's always been.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.245
Now, if you'll excuse me

11:52.345 --> 11:54.081
I have to go prep
for tomorrow's segment

11:54.181 --> 11:55.382
photographing
your dog's junk.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.952
Jack!

11:59.052 --> 12:00.287
You're making a huge mistake.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.022
If you want to get
to the top,

12:02.122 --> 12:04.091
you've got to compromise,
like me.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.026
What are you compromising?

12:06.126 --> 12:08.862
Okay.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.864
I'ma let you in
on a little secret.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.901
I'm not
who you think I am.

12:14.001 --> 12:18.038
My real name is Peg,
and I'm a hardcore lesbian.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.407
I'm into leather play,

12:20.507 --> 12:22.142
butch black girls,
skunking,

12:22.242 --> 12:24.377
pulling the blinds,
and poodle-balling.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.015
Whatever you got,

12:28.115 --> 12:30.918
I'll eat it, snort it,
or ride it, baby.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.022
Look.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.958
Go along with this
and it'll work for you.

12:38.058 --> 12:38.959
Look at me.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.961
I clear $165 a week.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.329
I moved out of my storage unit.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.764
I'm on TV.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.468
I'm the freaking dream.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.808
You present
a compelling case.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.910
I'm gonna have to
wrestle with this for a while.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.947
[shouts]
Elizabeth,
get the baby oil!

13:02.415 --> 13:04.151
Cricket?

13:05.886 --> 13:08.388
I've been watching you
on the monitors, and...

13:11.925 --> 13:15.062
you seem unhappy.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.264
Is there anything I can do to
make your stay more comfortable?

13:17.364 --> 13:19.099
Well...

13:19.199 --> 13:21.001
You know how you're always
walking around here drunk

13:21.101 --> 13:22.970
and popping pills
and whatnot?

13:25.372 --> 13:27.040
And following me
into the shower

13:27.140 --> 13:30.243
and throwing
hot coffee on me

13:30.343 --> 13:33.013
and climbing
into bed with me

13:33.113 --> 13:34.247
hysterically crying

13:35.282 --> 13:38.018
and making me spoon you
until you fall asleep?

13:38.118 --> 13:40.087
You gotta knock that off.

13:40.187 --> 13:43.123
Ha ha.
You are cute as a button.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.224
Boop!
Ha ha.

13:44.324 --> 13:48.028
So how come I haven't seen
this husband of yours?

13:48.128 --> 13:50.830
He's on a business trip
in the Philippines.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.165
I love Filipinos.

13:52.265 --> 13:55.468
They're Asian,
but not cocky about it.

13:57.137 --> 14:00.107
Well, as soon as he gets back,
I would like to meet him.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.442
You know, when possible,
I like to talk to a man

14:02.542 --> 14:06.146
before he puts a load
in my laundry basket.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.148
Not in my 20s anymore.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.319
Oh, honey.
Uh--

14:12.419 --> 14:13.586
I've been thinking.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.989
Maybe it's best
if you don't meet Stanley.

14:16.089 --> 14:20.027
Why, is he famous
or something?

14:20.127 --> 14:21.594
Is it Stanley Tucci?

14:21.694 --> 14:23.263
Oh my God, it's Stanley Tucci.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.432
I'm having Stanley Tucci's baby.

14:25.532 --> 14:29.903
No, honey,
it's not Stanley Tucci.

14:30.003 --> 14:33.006
Come on.
Sit down.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.042
The thing is,

14:35.142 --> 14:37.510
I haven't told my husband.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.279
I'm keeping it a secret.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.313
Yeah.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.514
When the baby is born,

14:41.614 --> 14:43.183
I'm going to put it
in a Pringles can

14:43.283 --> 14:44.517
and store it
in the cupboard.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.419
And then, when he opens the can,
the baby pops out.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.454
He'll be really happy.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.024
Are you sure you two

14:51.124 --> 14:54.161
are going to be able
to keep a baby alive?

14:56.596 --> 14:59.899
We're sure going to try.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.637
(Elizabeth)
Five minutes,
Mr. Takei.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.006
Oh, and did you
get your gift basket?

15:06.106 --> 15:07.207
There was only
a half-eaten muffin

15:07.307 --> 15:08.508
in a dirty freezer bag.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.010
Just wanted
to make sure you got it.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.416
Mr. Takei?

15:16.516 --> 15:17.951
I'm a huge fan.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.152
Would you sign my doll?

15:19.252 --> 15:20.153
Oh God.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.454
That sounded so girly.

15:21.554 --> 15:22.589
[stutters]

15:22.689 --> 15:24.191
I am an admirer
of your work.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.925
Would you sign my doll?

15:26.026 --> 15:27.694
Of course.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.229
I really respect you
for coming out.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.197
Though I always knew.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.665
Like in that one episode
where Yeoman Rand

15:32.765 --> 15:34.234
was wearing that
off-the-shoulder gown?

15:34.334 --> 15:35.602
I swear you slipped and said,

15:35.702 --> 15:38.405
"Set your phasers on stunning."

15:38.505 --> 15:40.707
[laughs]
I did.

15:40.807 --> 15:43.610
Shatner laughed so hard,
he split his girdle.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.645
[both laugh]

15:45.745 --> 15:49.116
Oh, George.
Such an honor to meet you.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.317
Hey, are you done
with that gift bag?

15:51.318 --> 15:53.120
I have a wet bathing suit
I want to bring home.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.521
(Amber Louise)
Hi!

15:54.621 --> 15:56.356
I'm Amber Louise.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.191
It's so nice to meet you.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.592
God bless America.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.361
And by that,
I mean all Americans.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.096
Even the ones
that need to be

16:03.196 --> 16:05.532
jailed without due process
now and then.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.535
So listen, George.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.238
The network asked that
you not mention you're gay.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.606
Or any
General Mills products.

16:13.706 --> 16:14.407
What?

16:14.507 --> 16:17.110
He will do
nothing of the sort.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.278
And do you know why?

16:18.378 --> 16:20.413
Because this is Sulu.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.749
An original member
from a show called Star Trek.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.217
Do you know
what that show was about?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.553
Papier-mâché rocks

16:26.653 --> 16:30.023
and Christmas lights
poking through cardboard?

16:31.158 --> 16:33.660
It was about tolerance
and acceptance.

16:33.760 --> 16:37.030
No matter what your color,
species, or hairstyle.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.132
Did Spock
hide his ears?

16:39.232 --> 16:41.101
Did Uhura
hide her femininity?

16:41.201 --> 16:43.002
Did Sulu hide his?

16:44.171 --> 16:45.305
Yes, he did.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.074
But it was a different time.
We forgive you.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.475
The point is,

16:48.575 --> 16:50.477
[as William Shatner]
no one on that bridge

16:50.577 --> 16:53.346
compromised who
or what they were.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.150
That's what
the show was about?

16:57.250 --> 16:58.185
Well!

16:58.285 --> 17:00.353
Now I'm glad
I did it.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.021
(Amber Louise)
Come on, Jack.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.156
The show's starting.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.157
Make up your mind, George.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.093
Are you with us
or against us?

17:06.193 --> 17:09.262
And by us,
I mean the troops.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.235
George,

17:15.335 --> 17:16.136
Jack will do
the right thing.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.804
Why don't you go
grab yourself an Oreo.

17:17.904 --> 17:20.073
Which are
suddenly everywhere.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.174
What are you doing?

17:22.075 --> 17:22.742
You can't let these people
push you around!

17:22.775 --> 17:23.576
Look,

17:24.277 --> 17:26.279
I don't want
to lose my job.

17:26.313 --> 17:29.716
I am too long and too hard
to lose all this now.

17:31.484 --> 17:32.785
Yes, Jack.

17:32.885 --> 17:33.820
You have worked
very long

17:33.920 --> 17:35.355
and very hard,

17:35.455 --> 17:38.091
but you have never
compromised who you are.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.127
Jack, you're on.
Here's your coffee.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.461
Uh, Elizabeth,

17:41.561 --> 17:43.330
this is not
my Matthew McConaughey mug.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.831
Yeah, the network won't let you
have him anymore.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.399
You have to drink out
of Salma Hayek now.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.670
(director)
And we're on in five.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.306
Four, three, two...

17:54.707 --> 17:56.776
Welcome to Talk Time USA.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.211
Hi, I'm Amber Louise.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.446
And this is Jack.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.615
Today's special guest
got his name in outer space

18:02.715 --> 18:04.151
But back here on Earth,

18:04.251 --> 18:05.818
he is legendary ladies' man

18:05.918 --> 18:07.287
and pro-life activist.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.322
[shouts]
No!

18:09.422 --> 18:10.490
I won't do it.

18:11.458 --> 18:14.527
George Takei is
a prancing, giggling queen.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.732
And I will not
slander his good name

18:19.832 --> 18:21.668
by implying he's straight.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.337
You were right, Will.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.240
(Will)
Live long and prosper, Jack!

18:27.340 --> 18:30.310
I have never
compromised myself before,

18:30.410 --> 18:32.379
and I am not
about to start now.

18:32.479 --> 18:36.115
No man should ever be forced
to drink out of Salma Hayek.

18:37.384 --> 18:38.451
I'll take her.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.859
I'm sure you'll be
happy to know,

18:46.959 --> 18:48.428
that Quicket crit.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.436
I mean Quicket crit.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.271
Damn it,
that is so hard to say.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.872
All right,
let me try this.

18:59.972 --> 19:04.411
Quicket is not going to
carry my craby.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.648
Karen, why do you
all of a sudden

19:08.748 --> 19:09.916
want to have a baby?

19:10.016 --> 19:11.584
I mean,

19:11.684 --> 19:13.286
if it's not because of me,

19:13.386 --> 19:14.787
there has to be a reason.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.289
And please don't tell me

19:16.389 --> 19:17.824
it's so you'll have
a baby Jesus

19:17.924 --> 19:20.493
for your
live Nativity display.

19:23.463 --> 19:24.764
Let's just drop it,
shall we?

19:24.864 --> 19:27.534
Let's talk about
something more pleasant.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.736
So.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.640
Guess who has a mole
the size of an eyeball

19:33.740 --> 19:35.442
on her thigh?

19:37.510 --> 19:38.611
You know what?
Forget it.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.580
I tried to be a friend.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.582
And for some reason,
you won't let me.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.916
So...

19:44.016 --> 19:45.685
No, Grace.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.223
Stanley and I
are having problems,

19:50.323 --> 19:52.191
and I...

19:52.292 --> 19:55.295
I thought maybe
having a baby would help.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.298
Karen, I had no idea.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.499
Yeah.

19:59.599 --> 20:00.667
I'm sorry.

20:00.767 --> 20:04.337
Ever since he
came back from the dead,

20:04.437 --> 20:06.373
he's been different.

20:07.907 --> 20:12.379
I mean, not like
a zombie or anything, but--

20:12.479 --> 20:15.382
[sighs]

20:15.482 --> 20:17.384
I don't know,
even the sex is different.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.486
Gosh, I can't tell you
how long it's been

20:19.586 --> 20:23.390
since we've skunked,
or poodle-balled.

20:29.396 --> 20:33.333
Um, have you tried
lighting candles?

20:36.336 --> 20:39.472
I'm thinking about leaving him,
Grace.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.975
Oh, Karen.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.816
All right, fine.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.618
I may have been fired
by the people

20:53.019 --> 20:55.455
who brought us Guantanamo Bay
and reduced-fat Triscuits.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.492
But at least I leave here
with my dignity!

20:59.592 --> 21:01.828
Please, Amber Louise.
Take me back!

21:01.928 --> 21:03.563
Bitch, get out of here!

21:03.663 --> 21:05.798
You spilled my Skittles!

21:05.898 --> 21:06.899
Get off!

21:06.999 --> 21:08.735
[sobbing]
Please, Amber Louise!

21:08.835 --> 21:10.303
Take me back!

21:10.403 --> 21:11.738
You're leaving
with your dignity.

21:11.838 --> 21:11.938
Remember, Jack?
