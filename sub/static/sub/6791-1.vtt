00:23.360 --> 00:25.249
I don't wanna scare anyone...

00:25.400 --> 00:28.086
but I'm gonna give it to
you straight about Jason.

00:30.400 --> 00:33.449
His body was never recovered
from the lake after he drowned.

00:36.280 --> 00:39.921
If you listen to the old-timers in town,
they'll tell you he's still out there.

00:40.080 --> 00:44.642
- Camp Crystal Lake is jinxed.
- It's got a death curse.

00:45.160 --> 00:47.686
Some folks claim they've
even seen him...

00:47.840 --> 00:49.251
right in this area.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.527
Who is that?

00:52.680 --> 00:55.968
Oh, hi. What are you
doing out in this mess?

00:58.520 --> 01:03.560
The girl who survived that night at
Camp Blood, that Friday the 13th...

01:04.680 --> 01:06.682
she claims she saw him.

01:06.840 --> 01:10.162
The boy. Is he dead too?

01:14.040 --> 01:16.281
We didn't find any boy.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.727
<i>Then he's still there.</i>

01:22.160 --> 01:24.128
She disappeared two months later.

01:27.640 --> 01:31.611
Legend has it that Jason saw his
mother beheaded that night...

01:37.520 --> 01:39.409
and he took his revenge.

01:53.440 --> 01:57.206
A revenge that he'll continue to seek
if anyone enters his wilderness again.

01:59.200 --> 02:03.728
Jason was my son. And
today is his birthday.

02:07.520 --> 02:10.170
That's a good boy.

02:10.320 --> 02:13.085
Good. Good Jason.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.570
Jason's out there.

02:38.880 --> 02:41.201
No! Aah! Aah!

02:47.920 --> 02:49.490
You can't be alive!

05:11.960 --> 05:16.249
Got another white coming in, Larry.
Let's keep the area clear.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.403
Where are they?

06:26.680 --> 06:28.603
What do you need and
where do you need it?

06:28.760 --> 06:31.411
We got ten of them.
Yours is in the barn.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.244
What's wrong with him?

06:33.400 --> 06:37.769
He's dead. Yeah, they're all dead.
You can pull it up over there.

06:37.920 --> 06:41.720
- All dead. Some emergency.
- Put her over there.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.607
This the guy that's been
leaving the wet stuff?

07:06.760 --> 07:10.446
This time he got seven
kids and three bikers.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.888
This time they got him.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.245
- Lainie?
- Hmm?

07:17.080 --> 07:19.890
- Belt him.
- Yeah.

07:27.560 --> 07:30.131
What's the matter
with you? He's dead.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.967
<i>Okay, boys and girls,
let's get going!</i>

08:32.840 --> 08:34.080
God!

08:42.159 --> 08:45.482
<i>Dr. Wellsely to O.R. 2.</i>

08:46.600 --> 08:48.568
Here, sign it.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.486
Hmm? Mm.

08:54.080 --> 08:58.404
- This your last?
- No, got one more over there.

08:59.920 --> 09:02.969
- Real cute girl.
- Was.

09:04.280 --> 09:08.968
She still is. All you gotta
do is go over there...

09:09.120 --> 09:12.920
Nice talk. Real nice talk.
I get the top copy.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.205
- Take care, Axel.
- Mm.

09:18.360 --> 09:19.691
Man, he's crazy.

09:24.880 --> 09:29.204
<i>Miss Aaron, telephone,
please. Miss Aaron.</i>

09:29.480 --> 09:32.484
- I'm free, doll.
- And a bargain at twice the price.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.450
- Hey. What's the matter?
- I have a headache, Axel.

09:35.600 --> 09:39.161
- For you, I always have a headache.
- Oh, I can fix that.

09:39.320 --> 09:40.651
Oh.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.250
Meet me in the cold room.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.210
I'm closing up for the night.
What do you say? Okay?

09:46.360 --> 09:50.809
Axel, I am not going to fake
any more orgasms for you.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.402
You got the curse?

09:55.480 --> 09:58.324
If I do, you're it.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.570
Axel?

10:11.520 --> 10:13.443
Axel.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.331
Oh, Axel.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.684
Axel?

10:41.560 --> 10:43.927
Aah! God, Axel!

10:44.640 --> 10:46.051
I'm so glad you could come.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.441
Axel, you are the Super
Bowl of self-abuse!

10:48.600 --> 10:51.126
I just came to watch the news.

10:53.160 --> 10:56.562
<i>Now back to today's news. The
tragic story of mass slayings...</i>

10:58.120 --> 10:59.360
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

11:01.240 --> 11:03.686
<i>And so begins yet another
chapter in a story...</i>

11:03.840 --> 11:06.446
<i>most residents of Crystal
Lake had prayed was over.</i>

11:06.640 --> 11:10.087
<i>A trail of mangled bodies has finally
led local authorities to conclude...</i>

11:12.120 --> 11:15.169
I really came to watch the news.

11:18.640 --> 11:22.406
<i>We're still awaiting positive
identification of the body.</i>

11:23.440 --> 11:26.649
<i>But to answer your question,
yes, the man responsible...</i>

11:26.800 --> 11:30.043
<i>for the murders in Wessex
County this past week...</i>

11:30.200 --> 11:33.283
<i>is at this moment in the Wessex
County Medical Center morgue.</i>

11:33.440 --> 11:35.886
- Yeah!
- Hey.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.566
That's you they're talking
about on TV, pal.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.927
I don't believe you, Axel.

11:41.080 --> 11:45.324
- Then... shut... my... mouth.
- My... mouth.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.842
<i>...in the wake of what
will always be known...</i>

11:50.000 --> 11:54.722
<i>as the Crystal Lake massacres.
And now back to you, Bill.</i>

12:19.720 --> 12:21.370
Jesus Christmas!

12:21.520 --> 12:23.602
Holy Jesus goddamn!

12:24.080 --> 12:28.244
Holy Jesus jumping Christmas shit!

12:28.680 --> 12:30.921
You better get that
sucker in the icebox!

12:31.080 --> 12:33.367
I must be nuts! I mean, I really...

12:35.360 --> 12:38.728
- Good night, Axel.
- Hey, where are you going?

12:38.880 --> 12:42.441
I'll tell you where I'm
going, I'm going crazy!

13:11.280 --> 13:13.726
Shit! Shit!

13:40.840 --> 13:42.922
Hi, girls. Thanks for waiting.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.804
Oh, no.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.884
Shit!

14:10.560 --> 14:15.088
Get lost, Axel, I'm busy. I've had
more than enough of you for one night.

14:17.320 --> 14:21.291
Read my lips. Leave me alone! Aah!

14:21.480 --> 14:22.641
No!

14:35.880 --> 14:38.850
- I talked to Dad.
- How is he?

14:39.000 --> 14:43.210
Oh. He said he was lonely. He
asked me to come out and see him.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.722
Did he tell you to take a number?

14:45.880 --> 14:49.168
No, but he asked about you.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.725
Did he?

14:50.880 --> 14:53.531
Actually, you really should
go out there to see him.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.091
Yeah, I know.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.686
I bet he could stand a visit.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.045
What do you think?

15:02.200 --> 15:04.487
- I think you're getting horny.
- Oh!

15:06.600 --> 15:09.888
Tommy, turn that down!

15:10.600 --> 15:12.443
Mom, I got 98,000.

15:12.800 --> 15:16.646
- How many robots is that?
- Thirty-five.

15:18.520 --> 15:21.285
Now, why don't you try killing
a few more up in your room?

15:21.480 --> 15:25.007
I can't. I need a
bypass patch cord.

15:25.160 --> 15:27.970
Maybe you can get one in town.

15:28.120 --> 15:29.804
Trish will drive you.

15:31.240 --> 15:35.006
Oh, honey, get a haircut, hmm?

15:35.200 --> 15:37.089
Oh, Ma.

15:38.680 --> 15:43.208
- That's a nice mask.
- Do I have to get a haircut?

15:43.960 --> 15:46.440
You're getting pretty terrific
at making those things.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.402
Thanks. I just customized it.

15:51.320 --> 15:54.130
- Where's Gordon?
- He went out.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.170
Oh. Someone left the
front door open.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.004
We're in the country.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.606
Well, what happens if
the psycho wanders in?

16:01.760 --> 16:04.684
He'd probably challenge him
to a game of "Zaxxon."

16:04.840 --> 16:06.524
Hear any more about
the place next door?

16:06.680 --> 16:08.523
Mm-hm. It's been
rented by some kids.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.648
- Great.
- How many?

16:11.440 --> 16:14.762
- Six.
- It'll be nice to have some company.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.324
<i>Country boy, country boy</i>

16:24.520 --> 16:26.045
<i>Sitting in the grass</i>

16:26.240 --> 16:28.641
<i>Along came a prairie dog
And crawled right up his ass</i>

16:28.840 --> 16:30.046
<i>Ask me no more questions</i>

16:30.200 --> 16:33.886
You broke up with BJ Betty?

16:34.800 --> 16:39.840
So to speak. And would you lighten
up on her? She's all right.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.491
Yeah, I'll say she's all right.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.527
You should have treated her right.

16:49.680 --> 16:53.002
I mean, that girl wanted
to be treated... right.

16:53.720 --> 16:57.406
I did. I did. I treated her right.

16:57.560 --> 17:00.769
I treated her right. That's
what's driving me so crazy.

17:01.360 --> 17:04.003
I mean, first I would call her
and she would take my calls...

17:04.160 --> 17:06.169
but she would have something
that she'd have to do.

17:06.319 --> 17:08.209
And then she wouldn't
even take my calls.

17:08.359 --> 17:11.603
I mean, can you figure that?
What the fuck happened?

17:13.000 --> 17:14.968
Let me put it in the old computer.

17:15.480 --> 17:19.201
- No, I'm serious about this.
- Hey, the computer don't lie.

17:19.359 --> 17:22.921
Now, let's see.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.525
What?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.844
It says...

17:42.320 --> 17:44.641
It says you're a dead fuck.

17:46.640 --> 17:49.211
What? A dead fuck?

17:49.360 --> 17:52.284
A lousy lay. You know?

17:52.440 --> 17:53.561
- A dead pecker.
- Oh, I see.

17:53.580 --> 17:55.264
Don't hold it back from me,
doc. I can take it.

17:55.290 --> 17:58.549
- Give it to me straight.
- I did not say it. The computer did.

17:58.600 --> 18:02.207
- Yeah, well, there is no computer!
- Aha! And there's no Betty either.

18:04.560 --> 18:07.040
Then I'm a dead fuck.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.771
Like I said, the
computer don't lie.

18:16.440 --> 18:18.807
God, I'm horny.

18:32.680 --> 18:36.241
- Where are we now?
- Lost.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.289
We are lost.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.202
Pretty creepy, huh?

18:45.200 --> 18:46.804
Yeah.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.611
All right, I think I got it.

18:49.760 --> 18:53.128
Go straight ahead two
miles and hang a right.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.164
Paul, let's pick her up.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.527
Sammy, where we gonna put her?

19:20.720 --> 19:23.883
Hey, honey, you got a sister?

19:24.040 --> 19:25.849
Ruff, ruff!

20:08.160 --> 20:10.322
Oh, Mom, I thought we
were having pizza.

20:10.520 --> 20:15.003
I thought so too, honey, but we've
got a refrigerator full of leftovers.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.721
You're not smiling. You're not
in the mood for my tuna salad?

20:19.880 --> 20:22.770
- Well...
- I'm not either.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.771
I'm in the mood for...

20:26.920 --> 20:29.161
- No.
- Yes.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.084
I feel like...

20:31.240 --> 20:34.164
- No!
- A Jarvis sandwich!

20:40.000 --> 20:42.287
- Wait, somebody's at the door.
- Oh, no, you don't.

20:42.440 --> 20:45.683
- No, Mom, I heard that too.
- I'll go.

20:48.440 --> 20:53.002
Gordon! Hey, Gordon. Where
have you been, huh, Gordon?

20:53.160 --> 20:56.528
Have you been sneaking around? Do
you have a girlfriend or something?

20:56.680 --> 20:58.603
Tommy, close the door.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.080
Listen, Gordon, we'll talk later.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.650
All right.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.571
- Hit me with the beer.
- You got it.

21:20.720 --> 21:25.123
- See? What did I tell you?
- What? You told me you were horny.

21:25.280 --> 21:29.251
No, see, I've come to realize that
a guy can have a good time...

21:29.400 --> 21:32.244
without having to
have girls all about.

21:32.400 --> 21:35.927
That's a sin, you dead fuck.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.560
I really, really don't want
you to call me that anymore.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.210
Aw.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.249
Hi. What a handsome mutt you are.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.847
- His name's Gordon. I'm Trish.
- Hi, Trish.

21:59.720 --> 22:01.688
I don't know how you do it.

22:01.880 --> 22:04.770
Heh. I don't know how you don't.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.649
I mean...

22:07.120 --> 22:09.282
you do it with everybody.

22:09.440 --> 22:11.647
Oh, I do not!

22:11.800 --> 22:13.643
I do it with Paul.

22:14.720 --> 22:17.963
- Really?
- Come on, Sara!

22:18.120 --> 22:21.283
You know how guys are. They
lie about that all the time.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.528
They say that about everybody.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.887
They don't say anything about me.

22:26.480 --> 22:27.641
I mean, I don't have...

22:27.800 --> 22:30.644
- Ha, ha. A reputation?
- I didn't say that.

22:30.800 --> 22:34.930
Oh. Look, I got my
reputation in sixth grade.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.370
Well, what does Paul think?

22:37.520 --> 22:42.686
Paul thinks I'm great in bed, so
that's where I keep him. Ha, ha.

22:44.840 --> 22:48.845
What are the sleeping
arrangements here, anyway?

22:49.760 --> 22:52.445
Paul and I are taking the bedroom
at the end of the hall...

22:52.640 --> 22:54.449
so you and Doug can
sleep next door.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.010
Really?

22:58.160 --> 23:02.848
Yeah. It's okay, they're bunk
beds. Don't worry about it.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.049
I'm gonna go to bed now,
Mom. Good night.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.125
Don't forget, 6 a.m.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.442
Once around the lake.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.931
Good night.

23:23.080 --> 23:25.526
- Sleep well.
- You too, Mom.

25:23.120 --> 25:25.771
I think when we get into town
I should give Betty a call.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.041
Ted. Ted?

25:30.200 --> 25:33.204
I think... I think when we get
to town I should call Betty.

25:33.360 --> 25:38.082
Jimbo, calling Betty is definitely
a dead-fuck thing to do.

25:39.680 --> 25:44.288
Look, first rule of love: Never get
rejected by the same girl twice.

25:44.440 --> 25:47.928
I mean, that's useless. If you wanna
make a fool out of yourself...

25:48.080 --> 25:51.448
always do it with someone new.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.841
Well, I don't know anybody new.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.288
Well, sex is a great
way to meet them.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.090
Ooh. Oh, my!

26:01.400 --> 26:02.970
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.841
- Don't worry about it.
- Hi.

26:06.040 --> 26:07.371
Hi.

26:07.520 --> 26:12.765
- You, uh... You girls live around here?
- How far is it to Crystal Point?

26:13.560 --> 26:16.450
- Well, that's where we're going.
- Yeah. It's a long walk.

26:16.600 --> 26:20.207
- We can take it.
- I'm going back to get the car.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.840
- Sara, do you want some company?
- This way?

26:23.000 --> 26:26.163
Thanks. I'll just
meet you guys there.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.209
All right.

26:29.200 --> 26:30.884
They're cute.

26:32.200 --> 26:35.283
Two of them. Two.
Count them, one, two.

26:35.440 --> 26:39.001
- Yes, yeah, and two of us.
- Exactly.

27:36.720 --> 27:39.041
Come on in! Ha, ha.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.805
Oh. No.

27:42.960 --> 27:45.770
No, we... we have no suits.

27:49.440 --> 27:50.726
All right!

27:51.280 --> 27:53.009
All right!

27:53.160 --> 27:55.162
Skinny-dip! Ah!

28:03.720 --> 28:06.166
Whoo! Sam!

28:18.880 --> 28:21.929
- Gordon, wait up!
- Gordon.

28:22.840 --> 28:26.367
Gordon, wait up! Wait a minute!

28:26.680 --> 28:28.284
Gordon!

28:34.480 --> 28:36.767
- Jimmy!
- Come on, Jimmy!

28:39.160 --> 28:41.208
Come on, Jimmy!

28:50.000 --> 28:51.081
Whoa.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.565
- Turn around.
- Can't I just...?

28:55.720 --> 28:59.441
- Turn around!
- Trish, come on in!

29:00.280 --> 29:02.806
No, thanks. I think
I'm overdressed.

29:02.960 --> 29:06.089
- Hey, Trish!
- Bye-bye.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.208
Party tonight!

29:08.360 --> 29:10.442
Come on, Gordon, we're
too young for this.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.726
Some pack of patootsies, huh?

29:13.880 --> 29:15.644
Tommy.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.405
Oh, no.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.449
What next?

29:45.760 --> 29:47.683
Can you fix it?

29:49.920 --> 29:54.244
- I need a screwdriver.
- Maybe there's one in the trunk.

29:58.960 --> 30:00.883
I need the keys.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.085
Thanks.

30:17.960 --> 30:19.325
Tommy, come on!

30:27.160 --> 30:29.811
Come in, Sara, let's
see what you got.

30:29.960 --> 30:33.851
- No.
- Come on, Sara. Strip and dip.

30:34.760 --> 30:37.366
Sam, I said no.

30:38.120 --> 30:40.964
Well, then, I'm gonna go under
and stay under until you do.

30:41.120 --> 30:43.282
See you later.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.250
Sam?

30:59.480 --> 31:00.811
Sam!

31:02.880 --> 31:04.211
Sam!

31:04.840 --> 31:06.888
God, Sam!

31:07.520 --> 31:08.965
God.

31:09.120 --> 31:10.610
Sam!

31:12.320 --> 31:15.210
Sam! Sam!

31:15.760 --> 31:18.331
Sam! Sam!

31:23.840 --> 31:27.367
Aah! Samantha, you bitch!

31:27.520 --> 31:29.807
- You like that?
- You bitch!

31:52.600 --> 31:54.967
Turn it on, Trish.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.204
Turn it on!

32:04.080 --> 32:09.166
- Whoa!
- Hi. Rob Dyer. Sorry about that.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.810
- Oh. Hello.
- Hi. What's your problem?

32:12.960 --> 32:16.282
- No problem.
- I mean with the car.

32:16.440 --> 32:19.649
Oh, the car. Um, it won't start.

32:19.800 --> 32:22.121
Well, get in. Give it a crank.

32:22.280 --> 32:24.362
Look, I've tried
everything already.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.727
The only thing it could
be is the solenoid.

32:27.600 --> 32:30.046
If you had a screwdriver...

32:36.560 --> 32:38.005
Okay, give it a crank.

32:45.160 --> 32:46.491
You need a lift?

32:48.720 --> 32:51.929
I didn't think anyone lived
this deep in the woods.

32:52.080 --> 32:55.926
We do. What are you
hunting for up here?

32:56.440 --> 32:59.603
Bear. Anybody up at the lake today?

32:59.760 --> 33:01.762
You can't be hunting for bear.

33:01.920 --> 33:05.129
How about kids? There any kids,
vacationers, people like that?

33:05.280 --> 33:10.207
Yeah. A bunch of kids moved in
yesterday. Right next door to us.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.570
- This is it.
- Thanks for the lift.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.724
Gordon!

33:38.360 --> 33:40.840
Would you like to
come in for a minute?

33:41.000 --> 33:42.650
I don't think I can.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.450
Well, you gotta come in.

33:45.280 --> 33:48.409
Come on, I got something real neat
to show you up in my bedroom.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.968
Hi, Mom!

33:53.120 --> 33:54.690
Tommy, who's your friend?

33:54.880 --> 33:57.326
Mom, this is Rob. Rob,
this is my mother.

33:57.480 --> 34:00.245
- Hello, Mrs...
- Jarvis.

34:32.480 --> 34:33.969
Amazing.

34:44.760 --> 34:47.161
Come here, I wanna
show you something.

35:15.440 --> 35:20.968
<i>No way, not tonight, no way</i>

35:21.960 --> 35:23.849
<i>Not today</i>

35:25.960 --> 35:29.561
<i>- Just 'cause you play it cool</i>
- Would you care to dance?

35:30.240 --> 35:33.244
- To this?
- It's good.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.407
<i>All right</i>

35:36.560 --> 35:37.925
Oh, well, good.

35:38.080 --> 35:40.970
<i>Don't ask me to stay</i>

35:41.120 --> 35:45.250
<i>Don't think you got it made
No, no</i>

35:46.400 --> 35:48.323
<i>You're wrong</i>

35:49.540 --> 35:53.630
<i>'Cause you can't fake it anymore</i>

35:55.760 --> 36:00.322
<i>I know what you're waiting for</i>

36:01.360 --> 36:05.490
<i>I should turn away
And walk right out that door</i>

36:05.680 --> 36:08.923
<i>Because I know love...</i>

36:09.080 --> 36:10.684
Hey, how come you turned that off?

36:10.840 --> 36:13.810
Relax, Jimbo. You're
gonna love this.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.688
Wanna give Teddy bear a kiss?

36:31.560 --> 36:36.168
Heh. Mm! Teddy. Teddy, uh...

36:36.320 --> 36:39.051
I've gotta get another drink.

36:41.760 --> 36:45.162
<i>With her eyes of night</i>

36:45.320 --> 36:49.211
- Excuse me.
- You like this stuff?

36:49.880 --> 36:52.087
You like slow dancing?

36:52.240 --> 36:53.844
<i>Tangerine</i>

36:54.000 --> 36:55.843
I could learn to.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.568
Kiss me, you fool.

37:00.160 --> 37:02.288
- Certainly.
- Ha, ha.

37:04.760 --> 37:07.001
Uh, maybe we could
dance to this one.

37:07.200 --> 37:10.682
Come on, let Teddy bear
show you how it's done.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.326
Stay near the trail.

37:27.480 --> 37:30.404
- It goes all the way around the lake.
- Yeah, I will.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.282
- There's only three of you up here?
- Mm-hm.

37:33.440 --> 37:37.650
My parents have separated. You
know, middle-aged crazies. Heh.

37:37.800 --> 37:40.883
I kind of hope they
get back together.

37:42.040 --> 37:44.441
Yeah, I hope so too.

37:49.760 --> 37:53.401
- Looks like another rainy one, huh?
- Yeah.

37:53.560 --> 37:55.801
Listen, if it gets
too bad out there...

37:56.000 --> 38:00.210
or if you wanna take a shower
or whatever, we're always home.

38:00.360 --> 38:04.126
And if we're not, Tommy
usually leaves the door open.

38:10.520 --> 38:13.205
- Good night.
- Take care.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.321
Hey, how you doing with yours?

38:25.040 --> 38:26.804
Nowhere, huh?

38:27.600 --> 38:29.090
Check.

38:29.280 --> 38:33.922
You gotta warm her up.
Watch me. Do what I do.

38:34.120 --> 38:39.331
And, Jimbo, don't be
such a dead fuck.

38:40.760 --> 38:43.240
I told you. I told you
that I didn't like that.

38:43.400 --> 38:46.529
- Besides, you've got the hot one.
- Check.

38:49.280 --> 38:51.487
- Hi.
- He thinks that's funny.

38:51.680 --> 38:54.331
He thinks that's a funny
thing he's doing.

39:03.120 --> 39:05.805
- Okay, you ready, Tina? On three.
- All right.

39:05.960 --> 39:07.121
- One!
- One!

39:07.320 --> 39:08.367
Two!

39:08.520 --> 39:10.488
Three!

39:14.560 --> 39:16.403
And the winner is... Tina!

39:16.560 --> 39:18.483
All right!

39:22.920 --> 39:24.649
What do I win?

39:24.840 --> 39:26.604
What do you want?

39:27.600 --> 39:29.762
Jimbo, put on another record.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.684
Jimbo.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.683
You don't mind, do you?

39:38.000 --> 39:41.447
Actually, I was thinking
about taking a little swim.

39:41.600 --> 39:44.888
It seems to be getting a
bit close in here for me.

39:45.520 --> 39:48.330
- Sam...
- Sara. Sara, let's dance.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.244
I don't wanna dance.

39:50.400 --> 39:52.687
Well, let's mind our own business.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.566
Look, I'll talk to Paul.

40:00.520 --> 40:01.726
All right?

40:10.640 --> 40:12.369
Mm.

40:29.160 --> 40:35.327
- I wanna talk to you for a second.
- Man, I am going to kill him.

40:36.560 --> 40:41.441
- I said I wanted to talk to you for a second.
- Not now, dead fuck.

40:43.480 --> 40:46.086
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.402
Do you believe this guy?

40:50.240 --> 40:53.926
- I mean, I had her. She was mine.
- Oh.

40:54.080 --> 40:56.686
Well, you know what I suggest
you do about that, Teddy?

40:56.840 --> 41:00.322
I think you should run that
through your little computer.

41:12.760 --> 41:14.489
Paul?

41:21.560 --> 41:24.245
I know you're out there, Paulie.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.405
Paul?

42:05.520 --> 42:09.286
Okay. Screw you, Paulie.

43:05.400 --> 43:07.562
Come on, Paul.

43:10.600 --> 43:13.001
I know you're out there.

43:18.080 --> 43:19.889
Paul?

43:29.600 --> 43:31.921
Screw you, Paul.

43:45.400 --> 43:47.641
Look, what's the matter?

43:47.800 --> 43:50.371
I can't go through with this.

43:50.560 --> 43:52.927
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

44:20.760 --> 44:22.888
<i>What good is a song</i>

44:23.040 --> 44:26.044
<i>If words just don't belong?</i>

44:26.200 --> 44:27.804
You wanna dance?

44:27.960 --> 44:30.645
Yeah. Yeah.

44:31.200 --> 44:33.965
<i>No good alone</i>

44:34.120 --> 44:37.841
<i>To each his own</i>

44:38.000 --> 44:42.164
<i>For me there's you</i>

44:42.400 --> 44:46.166
<i>If a flame is to grow</i>

44:46.320 --> 44:50.120
I thought that you
wanted to be with Ted.

44:51.400 --> 44:53.243
Well, I did.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.367
But now I wanna be with you.

45:00.720 --> 45:03.530
That makes me feel like a rat.

45:05.560 --> 45:07.961
<i>Two lips must insist</i>

45:08.120 --> 45:11.203
<i>On two more to be kissed</i>

45:12.080 --> 45:14.447
Well, do you wanna join them?

45:17.960 --> 45:19.564
Jimmy.

45:20.240 --> 45:23.005
Why don't we just go upstairs?

45:26.280 --> 45:27.964
Upstairs. Heh.

45:56.640 --> 46:01.806
Ahem. That's a teddy bear.
Wanna give Teddy bear a kiss?

47:18.520 --> 47:20.170
Fuck!

48:44.560 --> 48:46.449
Shit.

49:15.240 --> 49:16.526
Shit.

49:26.480 --> 49:29.848
This is... This is a neat room.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.924
This is your room.

49:33.080 --> 49:37.085
No. Actually, it's Paul's room.

49:38.920 --> 49:40.684
You're neat.

49:50.560 --> 49:53.131
- Oh, what a shock.
- Sorry.

49:56.320 --> 49:59.483
Hey, you guys! Look what I found.

50:06.960 --> 50:08.610
What is that?

50:17.560 --> 50:20.325
God, what a pig!

50:45.440 --> 50:48.171
Tina? We gotta go.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.682
You go.

50:53.480 --> 50:56.051
Tina, I'm gonna leave without you.

50:57.520 --> 50:59.363
Take an umbrella.

51:36.560 --> 51:38.483
You slut!

52:06.480 --> 52:08.448
I'm going upstairs.

52:10.840 --> 52:12.524
You tired?

52:13.680 --> 52:15.091
No.

52:19.480 --> 52:22.609
Do you mind sleeping in
the bottom bunk tonight?

52:25.120 --> 52:27.600
Why, you wanna sleep on the top?

52:30.200 --> 52:31.645
No.

52:41.040 --> 52:43.361
Give me a few minutes.

52:45.400 --> 52:47.243
Okay?

52:50.400 --> 52:52.767
Good night, Teddy bear. Ha, ha.

52:52.920 --> 52:54.524
Good night.

53:02.840 --> 53:05.571
- Ha, ha.
- Stop.

53:07.320 --> 53:12.247
Tommy? I'm gonna towel off and
then I'm gonna strangle you.

53:21.800 --> 53:24.246
Tommy? Trish?

53:42.000 --> 53:44.048
Anybody home?

53:58.120 --> 53:59.645
Gordon?

54:00.480 --> 54:02.289
Where's Tommy?

54:04.000 --> 54:05.764
Gordon?

54:09.800 --> 54:11.882
Where's Trish?

54:14.400 --> 54:17.051
Matter of fact,
where the hell are you?

54:29.280 --> 54:31.009
Gordon?

54:37.120 --> 54:39.088
Gordon?

54:47.240 --> 54:49.242
Gordon?

54:56.560 --> 54:58.449
Gordon?

55:13.840 --> 55:15.808
Watch it!

55:17.640 --> 55:21.964
Can we slow down a little?
The party's gonna go on all night.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.807
I think I'm gonna lose my lollipop.

55:52.960 --> 55:55.008
Mom, we're home.

55:59.080 --> 56:00.650
Mom?

56:00.800 --> 56:04.168
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

56:13.680 --> 56:15.045
Mom?

56:33.600 --> 56:35.170
Mom?

56:46.040 --> 56:50.170
- She's not here.
- Maybe she's still jogging.

56:50.320 --> 56:53.403
She's never gone this
long. And in the rain?

56:53.560 --> 56:55.210
- I'm going out on the path.
- Me too.

56:55.360 --> 56:57.203
No, you stay here in
case she comes back.

56:57.360 --> 57:00.648
- I'll go!
- Stay here and fix the lights.

58:18.520 --> 58:22.286
- What the hell are you doing here?
- What are you trying to do, kill me?

58:36.720 --> 58:39.530
Tina? Ahem.

58:39.680 --> 58:41.330
Hmm?

58:44.920 --> 58:47.002
Never mind.

58:50.040 --> 58:52.008
Tell me.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.445
Um...

58:58.360 --> 59:01.125
Did I...? Was, um...?

59:01.280 --> 59:03.601
Was I...?

59:06.160 --> 59:08.288
Was I a dead fuck?

59:10.440 --> 59:12.761
- What?
- A dead fuck.

59:13.840 --> 59:15.569
No.

59:18.800 --> 59:21.804
You, uh...? You know what I think?

59:23.800 --> 59:26.201
You know what I really think?

59:29.200 --> 59:30.964
I think you were incredible.

59:41.720 --> 59:44.690
- And I wanna do it again.
- Yeah.

59:46.560 --> 59:49.211
Don't you move. I'll be right back.

59:53.880 --> 59:55.882
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.011
Check it out.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.329
Why don't you run this through
your computer, Teddy bear?

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.163
Hey, congratulations, Jimbo.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.483
Where's that bottle of wine?
Why don't we celebrate?

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.371
I think maybe I drank it.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.090
I was great!

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:33.602
I was great. I was great.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.527
Love, Teddy bear!

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.763
L-O-V-E.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:43.925
Hey, Ted, where is...?
Where is that corkscrew?

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.448
That fancy corkscrew
for the wine bottle?

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.611
Ted?

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.204
Hey!

01:00:54.720 --> 01:01:00.124
Ted? Ted! Hey, Ted, where
the hell is the corkscrew?

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.811
Jimmy?

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:15.049
My sister Sandra was
a really great kid.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.770
But the man that killed
your sister is dead.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.329
No, he's alive.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.611
Look.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.925
Jason as a child, right?

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:32.880
Artist's conception of Jason as
described by a would-be victim, right?

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.611
And then the murders.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.251
But he's dead.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.206
Jason's body has disappeared
from the morgue.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.522
- It was stolen.
- It was not stolen.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.924
Two people at the hospital are
missing. This is coincidence?

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.210
He's alive.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.530
Oh, my God. Tommy's at the house.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:41.170
Ha, ha. Teddy.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.402
Oh, man.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.605
Oh.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.730
Oh. Ha, ha.

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:09.210
So you wanna give the
old Teddy bear a kiss?

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.689
Jimbo?

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.684
Jimbo?

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.168
Sara, I think I'm in heaven.

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.441
I think I'm in love.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.443
What?

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:25.886
I'll meet you in the bottom bunk.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:42.449
<i>Tangerine, she is all they claim</i>

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:45.126
<i>With her eyes of night</i>

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:49.291
<i>And lips as bright as flame</i>

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:53.121
<i>Tangerine</i>

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:07.241
<i>Tangerine</i>

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.289
<i>She is</i>

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.601
Sara? Change your mind?

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.005
Come on. Get in here.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.401
There's plenty of room.
We can sing a duet.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:37.367
Who is it, Paulie?

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.330
Paulie.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.488
Hey, Paulie, is that you?

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:50.650
Hey, Paulie. Whoops. Dropped
my bar of soap, old buddy.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.280
Lucky you ain't in
here with me, old pal.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:55.323
Ho-ho-ho.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.447
I came to hear you sing.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.928
So sing.

01:08:46.279 --> 01:08:49.727
Aah! Sam! Samantha!

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:55.167
Sam! Sam! Sam!

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.889
Sand!

01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:01.044
Sam! Sam!

01:09:32.439 --> 01:09:34.727
Oh, Tommy. Thank God you're okay.

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.881
- Oh, Tommy.
- What happened?

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.645
- Where's Mom? Is she back?
- No, not yet.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.041
I'm gonna call for help.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.402
Rob, what's going on?

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.887
- I'm not getting anything.
- I wanna go next door.

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.280
- I'm going with you.
- No.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.004
I'm going with you.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:08.848
- You stay here and lock the door.
- Tommy, hold the fort.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.930
Gordon!

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.807
- He's been here.
- Wait. What if he still is here?

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.566
Take this. Take it.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.566
I'm going downstairs. You
stay right here with Gordon.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:48.610
- No.
- Stay right here with Gordon.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.650
Gordon.

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.164
Gordon!

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:06.967
Gordon?

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:53.087
Rob! Rob, he's here! He's here!

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.765
Rob! Rob!

01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.282
Rob! Rob! Rob!

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.316
Rob, he's here! He's here.

01:15:01.342 --> 01:15:04.427
- He's killed all of them, I know it.
- Come one, come on.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.202
Shit. Give me a hand.

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:15.850
- Gotta get the knife.
- No! No. No!

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:17.647
Oh, my God!

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:26.088
Oh, God, he's killing me!
He's killing me!

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:29.164
Run, Trish! Run! Trish!

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.482
Trish, run!

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:14.491
No! Get off me!

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.561
Tommy!

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.131
- All the doors locked?
- Yes.

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:02.123
Go get me a hammer
and nails right now.

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:04.282
- Is he here?
- Yes.

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.447
Tommy, hurry!

01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.887
Help me! Help me!

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.849
Help me! Help me! Let me go!

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:08.845
Help me! Put me down! Put me down!

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:29.121
Tommy, help me push this.

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.369
Where is he?

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:13.441
What's he doing? What's he doing?

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:05.406
Listen, Tommy, I'm gonna
get him out of the house.

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:08.291
And when I do, I want you to
run like hell, do you hear me?

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:11.205
Run like hell, okay?

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.051
Oh, my God!

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.091
- Trish!
- Tommy, no!

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.850
Trish!

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.489
Trish!

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.724
Tommy?

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:42.850
Tommy, you were supposed to leave!

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:16.363
Tommy! Tommy, get the
hell out of here!

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:17.806
No!

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:20.247
You son of a bitch.

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.847
I'm gonna give you something
to remember us by.

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:43.164
Jason!

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:46.810
Jason!

01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:08.001
Remember me, Jason?

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.041
Jason, don't you remember?

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.561
Remember, Jason?

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.849
Jason, remember?

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.963
Remember?

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:46.603
Tommy.

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:07.726
Tommy!

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.447
Tommy!

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.608
Tommy!

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.844
Die!

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.890
- Die!
- Tommy!

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:35.360
Die!

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:39.489
<i>- Tommy!
- Die!</i>

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:44.882
The shoulder will
need some surgery.

01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:48.089
But we can wait till she's
a better candidate.

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:51.847
Now, you just get a
good rest, young lady.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.889
You haven't answered my question.

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:56.281
Neither one of you is
answering my question.

01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:59.165
Often, during extreme duress,
people are capable...

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:01.368
of extraordinary behavior.

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:05.320
That's what happened when your brother
violently attacked the killer.

01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:10.247
At that moment it was perfectly normal
for him to act to protect himself.

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.164
He's going to be just fine.

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:15.324
But right now,
what you need is rest.

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:19.848
Can I see my brother now?

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:23.522
Sure. But only for a minute.

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:25.682
I'll send him in.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.444
Tommy.
