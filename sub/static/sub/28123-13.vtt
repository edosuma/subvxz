01:33.790 --> 01:36.120
Didn't Rihanna
slip into your DMs?

01:36.120 --> 01:38.090
[all laugh]

01:38.090 --> 01:40.260
Are you two still a couple?

01:40.260 --> 01:42.200
Shadiest shenanigans...

01:42.200 --> 01:44.000
Being shady
doesn't make you opulent.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.470
I don't trust you, ho.

01:45.470 --> 01:47.240
[RuPaul]

Welcome to RuPaul's Drag Race

02:43.990 --> 02:47.460

with 11-gendary moments

02:52.930 --> 02:54.640
using #DragRace.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.570
Let's get this thing started.

02:56.570 --> 02:59.040
Miss Vanjie
didn't make the top four,

02:59.040 --> 03:00.910
but definitely made
a big impression.

03:00.910 --> 03:02.440
Let's take a look.

03:02.440 --> 03:05.480
Bitch, I'm back.
[clicks tongue]

03:05.480 --> 03:07.350
You just like someone
you want to get to know

03:07.350 --> 03:08.680
as a person.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.620
I wanna know
what you're gonna say next week.

03:10.620 --> 03:12.390
Hello, hello, hello.

03:12.390 --> 03:15.590
I can't help the fact
that I go into things at a 10.

03:15.590 --> 03:18.360
What's up, Ru? My
personality's what got me here.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.690
Thank you, Britney.

03:19.690 --> 03:21.930
I'm jus trying to figure out
how to organize it.

03:21.930 --> 03:24.430
Baby, I'm looking
at this script

03:24.430 --> 03:25.600
like it's the Da Vinci Code
or something.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.640
I don't even know
what is on this paper.

03:28.640 --> 03:30.910
The Meryl Streep of drag
you are not.

03:30.910 --> 03:32.310
Who dat?

03:32.310 --> 03:34.310
Oh, from Devil Wears Prada?

03:34.310 --> 03:36.080
Don't sleep on the turtle.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.480
[Michelle]
It's either a leotard

03:37.480 --> 03:40.080
or a corset and a panty
and some kind of pasty.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.080
I know what
you're gonna be wearing

03:41.080 --> 03:42.080
when you some around the corner.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.690
I shouldn't be doing that.

03:43.690 --> 03:44.890
[Ariel] She took a lot of time

03:44.890 --> 03:46.290
to like
really tailor this dress in

03:46.290 --> 03:47.860
to like perfectly fit me.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.020
I didn't pay her
to say that, either.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.960
You made me so proud tonight.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.460
[sniffles]

03:52.460 --> 03:55.400
I just really wanted
to make you guys proud.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.100
It was getting frustrating.

04:07.640 --> 04:11.480
Miss Vanjie,
you didn't just come back.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.620
Bitch, you came through.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.950
Now sashay away.

04:16.950 --> 04:18.050
Thank you.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.650
Love ya.

04:19.650 --> 04:22.920
I might come back. Don't
turn off the spotlight yet.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.730
I might come back, bitch.

04:24.730 --> 04:27.700
I could come back again
and be like, hey.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.260
I'm at the finale, too.

04:29.260 --> 04:30.670
Y'all never know, bitch.

04:30.670 --> 04:33.200
They might spin the wheel
and land on me again, bitch.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.400
[all laugh]

04:34.400 --> 04:36.770
Aah! See ya later!
Miss Vanjie!

04:36.770 --> 04:38.170
Do this.

04:38.170 --> 04:41.040
[laughter and applause]

04:41.040 --> 04:42.480
[RuPaul] Now, Vanjie,
what's your proudest moment

04:42.480 --> 04:43.680
being on this season?

04:43.680 --> 04:44.710
[Vanjie] One of my
proudest moments

04:44.710 --> 04:46.350
is getting invited back.

04:46.350 --> 04:47.520
Not everybody gets
an invitation to come back.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.280
It's like
the Willy Wonka ticket.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.550
Five ho's get it.

04:50.550 --> 04:53.050
If you ain't one,
I hope you like the chocolate.

04:53.050 --> 04:56.630
So for me to come back
to the factory

04:56.630 --> 04:59.130
with all the oompa loompas,
bitch, I was happy.

04:59.130 --> 05:02.100
Me getting recognition
from a lot of my peers

05:02.100 --> 05:03.770
and the celebrity guest judges,

05:03.770 --> 05:06.970
it makes me realize like,
this is like legit.

05:06.970 --> 05:08.400
Yeah. You look a lot different.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.510
You know, every time--
after a long period of time,

05:10.510 --> 05:12.170
the girls
have been on the show--

05:12.170 --> 05:15.910
Well, hold on.
I ain't with Dr. Shujmo. No!

05:15.910 --> 05:17.580
What do you think is different?

05:17.580 --> 05:18.950
Are your teeth new?

05:18.950 --> 05:21.750
[all laugh]

05:21.750 --> 05:22.780
Is the camera on?

05:22.780 --> 05:24.550
Yes, mama, they is.

05:24.550 --> 05:26.290
[RuPaul] They're beautiful.
They're gorgeous.

05:26.290 --> 05:27.290
And, you know,
there's a little filler,

05:27.290 --> 05:28.760
but, you know, who doesn't?

05:28.760 --> 05:31.390
Who doesn't?
That's just--

05:31.390 --> 05:33.660
That's what I'm saying. Girl,
did you tie your laces? Yeah.

05:33.660 --> 05:35.060
Did you get some filler?
Girl, good.

05:35.060 --> 05:37.500
It is like saying
hello and goodbye.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.370
These days, that is the norm.

05:39.370 --> 05:40.670
Yes, of course.

05:40.670 --> 05:41.800
So if you ain't filing,
bitch, you ain't winning,

05:41.800 --> 05:42.800
so come on.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.210
[all laugh]

05:44.210 --> 05:46.880
Get with the program.
Get with the winning team, baby.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.080
Get with the winning team.

05:48.080 --> 05:51.510
Now, a lot of people
were rooting for you

05:51.510 --> 05:52.850
to make the top four.

05:52.850 --> 05:55.480
How did it feel
to be eliminated last week?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.220
Honestly, it was embarrassing.

05:57.220 --> 05:58.390
Like I felt--

05:58.390 --> 06:00.220
Really? You did so well.

06:00.220 --> 06:02.090
[Vanjie] Yeah, but I was, like,
still embarrassed

06:02.090 --> 06:03.530
like 'cause watching it back

06:03.530 --> 06:04.760
and seeing
what Michelle's saying,

06:04.760 --> 06:06.490
I do understand.

06:06.490 --> 06:09.060
Like I was probably more mad
than the audience.

06:09.060 --> 06:10.530
I said, bitch,
what the fuck was you thinking

06:10.530 --> 06:13.130
when you packed 45 swimsuits?

06:13.130 --> 06:14.700
[Yvie chuckles]

06:14.700 --> 06:16.540
Yvie.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.810
No, I was mad at myself.

06:18.810 --> 06:21.210
Why did you bring
so many swimsuits?

06:21.210 --> 06:22.880
[Vanjie] What had happened was

06:22.880 --> 06:24.380
I was traveling a lot,
I was working,

06:24.380 --> 06:27.220
so I was doing everything
over the phone

06:27.220 --> 06:29.020
with a bunch of
different designers

06:29.020 --> 06:30.590
not realizing
a lot of the designers

06:30.590 --> 06:33.390
were making me a lot
of the similar silhouettes.

06:33.390 --> 06:34.420
That was on brand for you.

06:34.420 --> 06:35.620
[Vanjie]
Yeah, which is a brand,

06:35.620 --> 06:37.160
but, bitch, I don't want
to be getting ragged

06:37.160 --> 06:39.960
every other day
by Miss Michelle Mishage.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.430
-Michelle Mishage.
-That ain't cute.

06:42.430 --> 06:43.830
I be crying
from episode 5

06:43.830 --> 06:45.270
all the way through 12.

06:45.270 --> 06:46.770
The hell, Michelle?

06:46.770 --> 06:48.470
[all laugh]

06:48.470 --> 06:51.970
Yvie, what'd you think
of Vanjie's silhouette?

06:51.970 --> 06:54.480
It was a good silhouette,
bitch,

06:54.480 --> 06:55.740
but you were kicking
that dead horse

06:55.740 --> 06:57.650
like years after she had passed.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.650
Literally. I know.

06:59.650 --> 07:00.820
It's not like
I'm going around saying,

07:00.820 --> 07:02.180
"Oh, bitch,
I'm getting away with it."

07:02.180 --> 07:03.690
I'm over here running around
with these bathing suits.

07:03.690 --> 07:06.790
I was like, hiding
the motherfucking bathing suits.

07:06.790 --> 07:08.520
I said, oh, I don't want
these ho's to read me.

07:08.520 --> 07:09.860
Let me put it in my suitcase.

07:09.860 --> 07:11.730
'Cause I know
they looking at me crazy.

07:11.730 --> 07:13.460
Yvie called it out,

07:13.460 --> 07:15.030
and I said
now the other eyes are on me.

07:15.030 --> 07:17.600
And, Shuga, you had
some opinions on her silhouette.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.300
[Shuga] I did. I mean, you look
gorgeous in this silhouette.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.700
But I think like
when we started to look

07:21.700 --> 07:24.570
at everyone doing their thing,
it was the same thing.

07:24.570 --> 07:25.810
And I know
I was working really hard

07:25.810 --> 07:27.140
to like try
and take the critiques,

07:27.140 --> 07:29.080
and so it did become
frustrating, I think,

07:29.080 --> 07:31.680
especially after the fact
of watching it.

07:31.680 --> 07:32.980
It seemed like, oh, bitch,
here comes another week,

07:32.980 --> 07:34.180
and she got a silhouette,
she got a pass.

07:34.180 --> 07:35.650
Do you think
I was the only one--

07:35.650 --> 07:37.150
No. Absolutely.
No, no, I was--

07:37.150 --> 07:38.990
'Cause why you getting
so frustrated with me?

07:38.990 --> 07:42.020
'Cause whatever they're telling
you in your own situation.

07:42.020 --> 07:43.930
I can't get mad
if I don't agree

07:43.930 --> 07:47.000
if they're saying somebody
don't have a fierce personality

07:47.000 --> 07:49.400
and they're saying,
girl, you made one good joke.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.970
Kudos to you. I didn't think
you were gonna be funny.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.700
But they're telling me,
you funny,

07:52.700 --> 07:54.540
but we need more.

07:54.540 --> 07:57.570
So I don't compare and contrast
the two ho's.

07:57.570 --> 07:58.740
[Soju] She's the queen
of silhou--

07:58.740 --> 08:00.640
I'm the queen
of silhouette, actually.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.440
You know, I know everything
about silhouette.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.450
You don't say?

08:04.450 --> 08:07.450
I think Vanjie was so scared
from her first season...

08:07.450 --> 08:08.680
[Vanjie] I agree.

08:08.680 --> 08:10.790
That she just wanted
to show off that body

08:10.790 --> 08:12.290
every single time.

08:12.290 --> 08:13.290
-And, you know--
-That's true, too.

08:13.290 --> 08:14.260
You did that.

08:14.260 --> 08:15.460
After Season 10,

08:15.460 --> 08:18.030
I just wanted to make sure
I was correct.

08:18.030 --> 08:19.490
Fuck, I was correct too much

08:19.490 --> 08:22.000
that she said,
I'm sick of this shit.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.430
So watching it back,
then I get mad at myself.

08:25.430 --> 08:27.540
And so me getting eliminated,
I'm like...

08:27.540 --> 08:29.540
I was just embarrassed.
I don't know.

08:29.540 --> 08:31.170
But, bitch, I was so close.

08:31.170 --> 08:32.410
[RuPaul] Well, you know,
the thing is,

08:32.410 --> 08:35.540
everybody's a winner
once you get on TV.

08:35.540 --> 08:36.640
I think Gore Vidal said,

08:36.640 --> 08:38.850
"Never turn down an opportunity

08:38.850 --> 08:41.580
to have sex
or be on television."

08:41.580 --> 08:42.720
Very true.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.550
And apparently,
you were doing both.

08:44.550 --> 08:46.890
[all laugh]

08:46.890 --> 08:48.390
The whole world of winning.

08:48.390 --> 08:50.560
Shit, that's what I say.
If I don't get the crown,

08:50.560 --> 08:53.330
at least I got some dick.

08:53.330 --> 08:54.730
Thanks to Brooke Lynn.

08:54.730 --> 08:56.730
In a season full of surprises,

08:56.730 --> 09:00.900
one of the biggest
was love in the workroom.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.800
Vanjie and Brooke Lynn

09:02.800 --> 09:04.510
had the first
onscreen love affair

09:04.510 --> 09:06.910
in Drag Race herstory.
Take a look.

09:06.910 --> 09:08.240
Hi, Papi.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.750
-Hi
-How are you?

09:10.750 --> 09:11.880
Good.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.220
What's going on?

09:15.220 --> 09:17.950
I think Vanjie's really cute,

09:17.950 --> 09:20.490
and we're just
getting to know each other.

09:20.490 --> 09:22.490
It's real fresh
out the womb.

09:22.490 --> 09:24.390
You know,
I'm going with the flow.

09:24.390 --> 09:27.400
Those kisses keep coming,
I'm gonna keep accepting.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.200
[all laugh]

09:29.200 --> 09:30.430
Me and Vanjie...

09:30.430 --> 09:34.400
it's nice
having this thing happen.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.840
But this is work.
We're here for a competition.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.370
It's not personal, it's drag.

09:37.370 --> 09:40.340
So, Brooke Lynn,
who do you choose for yourself?

09:41.440 --> 09:43.210
I'm going to choose
Miss Nina West.

09:44.610 --> 09:45.880
I didn't pick Vanjie
as my partner

09:45.880 --> 09:47.650
'cause Vanjie's great
at being Vanjie.

09:47.650 --> 09:49.650
I wouldn't say Vanjie's
a wonderful actor.

09:49.650 --> 09:52.420
I was surprised
you didn't choose Brooke Lynn.

09:52.420 --> 09:55.620
I was thinking with this,
not with this or this.

09:55.620 --> 09:57.690
And not only
do I have to lip sync,

09:57.690 --> 09:59.460
now I have to lip sync
against Brooke Lynn.

09:59.460 --> 10:03.930
I would have felt better against
anybody but him. Anybody.

10:03.930 --> 10:05.900
One of us
is going home after this,

10:05.900 --> 10:07.400
and that sucks.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.200
But we're both gonna give this
our best shot.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.370
I'm not throwing anything away
for anybody.

10:13.980 --> 10:18.680
Let's kiki abut your kyky.
Brooke Lynn...

10:18.680 --> 10:19.780
[all laugh]

10:19.780 --> 10:22.050
How did it all get started?

10:22.050 --> 10:24.190
Vanjie kind of
started things off.

10:24.190 --> 10:25.320
You did. He was kind of--

10:25.320 --> 10:26.960
-Allegedly.
-Allegedly.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.860
He started flirting with me.
I thought he was very cute, too,

10:28.860 --> 10:30.530
but I was at a competition.

10:30.530 --> 10:31.730
I wasn't looking for romance,

10:31.730 --> 10:33.060
but then he started
flirting with me,

10:33.060 --> 10:34.360
and I was like, okay, well...

10:34.360 --> 10:36.360
We were on our way
into our rooms,

10:36.360 --> 10:38.370
and Silky said to Brooke Lynn
down the hall,

10:38.370 --> 10:41.740
"Brooke Lynn,
Vanjie got a crush on you."

10:41.740 --> 10:46.210
And Brooke Lynn
grabbed his Canadian bacon

10:46.210 --> 10:49.880
and I said, "Hola.
¿Cómo está?

10:49.880 --> 10:51.080
[laughs]

10:51.080 --> 10:52.250
[Vanjie]
I said I'm from Puerto Rico.

10:52.250 --> 10:53.550
So that's what had happened,

10:53.550 --> 10:55.680
and the rest, you know,
happened in the workroom.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.750
It was nice, 'cause
we couldn't really do anything.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.420
[all laugh]

10:59.420 --> 11:00.960
We're on set, so it was like

11:00.960 --> 11:03.490
this nice little
like schoolboy romance.

11:03.490 --> 11:05.530
[RuPaul] Now the world
is dying to know,

11:05.530 --> 11:07.000
are you two still a couple?

11:11.700 --> 11:13.030
No, we're not.

11:13.030 --> 11:14.400
[RuPaul] Why not?

11:14.400 --> 11:16.800
We dated for about four months
after the show, um,

11:16.800 --> 11:18.140
and we tried to make it work,

11:18.140 --> 11:19.910
but our schedules were just
very different.

11:19.910 --> 11:21.980
He was traveling all the time,
I wasn't traveling at all.

11:21.980 --> 11:24.350
So we never really
saw each other.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.650
And it was scary for me.

11:25.650 --> 11:27.050
What does being in
a relationship mean to you?

11:27.050 --> 11:28.980
It means like you guys
are committed to one another?

11:28.980 --> 11:30.790
-Yeah.
-You can't date other people?

11:30.790 --> 11:32.590
Well, it wasn't
just that, like,

11:32.590 --> 11:34.460
I've always--the number one
thing that's always been

11:34.460 --> 11:36.590
really important to me
is my freedom.

11:36.590 --> 11:38.360
I've always wanted to be free

11:38.360 --> 11:40.160
and be able to do
what I want to do.

11:40.160 --> 11:42.200
To factor somebody else into...

11:42.200 --> 11:45.670
my life and plans, and just have
that feeling like,

11:45.670 --> 11:48.400
I could never look at somebody
else and find them attractive,

11:48.400 --> 11:50.370
or never flirt
with somebody else

11:50.370 --> 11:51.840
was really scary for me,
and that kind of...

11:51.840 --> 11:54.040
I was starting to feel
really stifled.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.740
And it was really hard,

11:55.740 --> 11:58.280
because I really do care
for Vanjie a lot.

11:58.280 --> 11:59.550
And I still have a lot of love
for him, and...

11:59.550 --> 12:01.220
[RuPaul] Yeah,
because Vanjie you said

12:01.220 --> 12:04.650
you wanted that Nicholas Sparks
The Notebook kind of love.

12:04.650 --> 12:07.590
I wanted, yeah--
a romantic at heart, and when it

12:07.590 --> 12:09.260
- comes to stuff like that...
- I love that about you.

12:09.260 --> 12:11.760
I'm not...
I don't play.

12:11.760 --> 12:12.990
And I wanted the Notebook
experience,

12:12.990 --> 12:14.800
and I was getting a Post-it.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.800
[laughs]

12:15.800 --> 12:17.700
It is no Tee, and it's okay.

12:17.700 --> 12:20.400
And that's why we
are on good terms,

12:20.400 --> 12:22.370
because we recognized it early.

12:22.370 --> 12:23.740
And it is what it is.

12:23.740 --> 12:25.070
We had different views.

12:25.070 --> 12:27.180
And what was it like
to relive it on television.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.480
[Brooke Lynn] Honestly,
that's been really nice.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.980
'Cause it was a really nice
moment for me, like,

12:30.980 --> 12:32.550
It's a great memory to have

12:32.550 --> 12:35.320
and like I said,
I'll always love him.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.850
And I really do
have love for him,

12:36.850 --> 12:38.190
You know I love you too.

12:38.190 --> 12:40.050
I'm really happy we can
just still be friends.

12:40.050 --> 12:42.720
People online were saying that
it was just for the cameras.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.030
Not at all, no.

12:44.030 --> 12:47.460
I will say, though, like,
knowing really early on

12:47.460 --> 12:48.660
before I think the show knew,

12:48.660 --> 12:50.060
I even was kinda like,
is this real?

12:50.060 --> 12:51.900
Did anyone else think that...

12:51.900 --> 12:54.370
[Scarlet] I was skeptical.
[A'keria] I was, too.

12:54.370 --> 12:55.770
I was skeptical because
I thought it was

12:55.770 --> 12:57.710
like, a clout situation.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.410
What do you mean,
a clout situation?

12:59.410 --> 13:01.040
Like, Vanjie is a personality.

13:01.040 --> 13:04.010
And so on the show, anything
you attach with Vanjie

13:04.010 --> 13:05.680
is also going to be
a personality.

13:05.680 --> 13:07.720
And Brooke didn't have
that strong point

13:07.720 --> 13:09.020
as for a type of personality.

13:09.020 --> 13:11.620
So it's like, let me
grasp onto something

13:11.620 --> 13:13.190
to have a storyline.

13:13.190 --> 13:15.260
[Brooke Lynn] And that's
why I was so careful

13:15.260 --> 13:17.590
to distance myself from Vanjie
in any part of the competition.

13:17.590 --> 13:19.690
Because I was aware people were
probably going to think that.

13:19.690 --> 13:22.330
And I wanted to just keep that
very, very separate.

13:22.330 --> 13:24.100
And quite honestly,
I didn't feel

13:24.100 --> 13:25.900
like I needed any help
in the competition.

13:25.900 --> 13:27.340
[RuPaul] Okay.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.040
Do you want to
get back together?

13:31.970 --> 13:33.940
Do you want
to get back together?

13:33.940 --> 13:35.680
I'm not gonna say never.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.610
Like I still have
feelings for you.

13:37.610 --> 13:39.680
And I know you still
have feelings for me.

13:39.680 --> 13:42.450
And just as long as we always
have love for each other,

13:42.450 --> 13:44.020
anything is possible in future.
-[RuPaul] Yeah.

13:44.020 --> 13:46.320
Well, listen,
keep your options open,

13:46.320 --> 13:47.420
because I'd like to announce

13:47.420 --> 13:49.820
a new VH1 dating show.

13:49.820 --> 13:51.830
[laughter]

13:51.830 --> 13:54.300
I Love Brooke Lynn
and Miss Vanjie of Love.

13:54.300 --> 13:57.930
[laughter]

13:57.930 --> 13:59.630
-Let me give him a hug.
-Get a kiss!

13:59.630 --> 14:01.940
-Aww.
-So sweet.

14:01.940 --> 14:04.670
-Ooh.

14:04.670 --> 14:08.310
And this ain't fake,
motherfuckers!

14:08.310 --> 14:10.210
[laughter]

14:10.210 --> 14:14.680
The Queen who put the Tee,
in "salt-tee."

14:14.680 --> 14:16.420
[laughter]

14:16.420 --> 14:19.390
Ooh, child.
Ra'Jah O'Hara.

14:19.390 --> 14:21.160
Take a look.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.860
[cheers and laughs]

14:22.860 --> 14:24.390
If you have enough balls
to tell Ru,

14:24.390 --> 14:26.090
then tell Silky
to her goddamn face.

14:26.090 --> 14:28.000
W-w-w-w-wait!

14:28.000 --> 14:30.470
I'm not liking
that energy at all.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.770
Put that shit on ice.

14:32.770 --> 14:34.770
Girl, you better
put your own self on ice.

14:34.770 --> 14:36.900
You better focus
on this goddamn challenge.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.210
Oh, I'm focused, boo.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.840
Your makeup says otherwise.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.510
Ooh, girl.

14:42.510 --> 14:44.850
An ugly girl can never come
for a pretty girl.

14:44.850 --> 14:46.480
No, it's an ugly bitch
like you,

14:46.480 --> 14:49.520
crawling out of the swamp
to come for me?

14:49.520 --> 14:51.350
Mm-mm, girl.
I'm over it.

14:51.350 --> 14:53.320
But when are you going to apply
that to the challenges,

14:53.320 --> 14:54.820
'cause that's what's gonna keep
you out of the bottom.

14:54.820 --> 14:56.790
Now, I will tell you this.

14:56.790 --> 14:58.230
Don't try me right now.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.660
That's not trying you, girl.
That's being honest.

14:59.660 --> 15:01.060
-N-n-no.
- That's the Tee, girl.

15:01.060 --> 15:02.400
-You better take
that tone back down.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.300
How dare you.

15:04.300 --> 15:07.140
You, first and foremost,
are not sickening at all.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.440
You are literally wearing trash.

15:09.440 --> 15:13.340
I'm not gagging.

15:13.340 --> 15:17.150
I mean, I'm gagging
from like, the smell.

15:17.150 --> 15:20.620
It's like, bitch, do you bathe?

15:20.620 --> 15:22.680
Ladies, I have a final question.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.890
Who should go home tonight?

15:24.890 --> 15:26.150
Ra'Jah?

15:26.150 --> 15:28.020
If it were my choice,
I would send Scarlet.

15:28.020 --> 15:30.560
A lot of times when
I was losing my way,

15:30.560 --> 15:34.700
well, I won't blame her for some
of the mistakes that I made.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.400
But, Scarlet.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.630
Scarlet, who should
go home tonight?

15:38.630 --> 15:42.070
I guess Ra'Jah's
been in the bottom...

15:42.070 --> 15:44.710
A lot.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.240
Bitch, you was
on the same bottom with me.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.040
The first go-round.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.780
-Yeah, well I'm sorry--
-First, uh-uh...

15:49.780 --> 15:50.950
-You can't take it personally.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.410
No, because I am taking it
personally.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.510
Okay, well, sorry.

15:53.510 --> 15:54.680
Because you threw me
under the bus.

15:54.680 --> 15:56.620
Well they asked me a question.

15:56.620 --> 15:58.720
It's not like I'm mad at you,
that's just how I felt.

15:58.720 --> 16:02.190
I feel like you're
very mad at me.

16:02.190 --> 16:04.660
You were not shy
in those interviews.

16:04.660 --> 16:06.660
You were not afraid
to let those girls have it.

16:06.660 --> 16:08.200
[laughs]

16:08.200 --> 16:11.630
Early on you had some opinions
about Yvie's opinions.

16:11.630 --> 16:13.700
[laughter]

16:13.700 --> 16:16.040
Do you stand by those opinions?

16:16.040 --> 16:19.040
Well, I will say
that in the moment,

16:19.040 --> 16:21.780
that's what I was thinking,
that's what I said.

16:21.780 --> 16:23.080
I said what I said.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.810
But, you know, I felt like
that was just like,

16:25.810 --> 16:28.280
light reads,
it wasn't anything like...

16:28.280 --> 16:30.650
I disagree with you, girl.
Okay, I'm sorry.

16:30.650 --> 16:32.620
I love you, but the fact
that I came to you

16:32.620 --> 16:34.190
and was talking about actions

16:34.190 --> 16:36.190
or things that were happening
in the room--

16:36.190 --> 16:39.190
and I said it
all to your face.

16:39.190 --> 16:41.860
And it was so painful
to have to go back home,

16:41.860 --> 16:43.530
and watch you call me ugly,

16:43.530 --> 16:45.130
watch you call me smelly.

16:45.130 --> 16:47.870
Watch you call me, like,
worthless, essentially,

16:47.870 --> 16:49.740
because I told you
you need to focus.

16:49.740 --> 16:51.270
Like, I'm sorry,
I just don't think

16:51.270 --> 16:53.270
that was the right response
in the moment.

16:53.270 --> 16:56.080
Well, I will apologize that you
feel some type of way,

16:56.080 --> 16:57.480
I will even apologize for--

16:57.480 --> 16:58.910
I don't think that's
an apology.

16:58.910 --> 17:00.980
That isn't.
That's some bullshit.

17:00.980 --> 17:02.180
You don't apologize

17:02.180 --> 17:04.690
because someone's feeling
some kind of way.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.490
You said some hurtful shit
behind my back.

17:07.490 --> 17:08.860
Well, can I finish
what I was saying?

17:08.860 --> 17:10.930
Absolutely.

17:10.930 --> 17:13.430
Because you can direct it this
way when you're done with Yvie.

17:13.430 --> 17:15.100
[Plastique] Oooh.

17:15.100 --> 17:16.700
I will apologize.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.370
It was definitely not
my intentions

17:18.370 --> 17:20.770
to drag you through the mud.

17:20.770 --> 17:22.070
You know, but like I said,

17:22.070 --> 17:23.500
I was feeling some type of way,

17:23.500 --> 17:26.570
and I went to the elementary
school level with my read.

17:26.570 --> 17:30.010
How did it feel watching
yourself on television

17:30.010 --> 17:31.380
doing that?

17:31.380 --> 17:33.380
It was actually eye-opening
getting an opportunity

17:33.380 --> 17:34.650
to watch myself on TV.

17:34.650 --> 17:35.950
Eye-opening how?

17:35.950 --> 17:37.550
Well, because I don't
necessarily see myself

17:37.550 --> 17:38.990
as like, maliciously mean.

17:38.990 --> 17:41.820
I don't go out of my way
to be like in your face,

17:41.820 --> 17:43.620
you know, "I hate you, bitch,"
you know--

17:43.620 --> 17:46.730
But you saw what we just saw,
what did you...

17:46.730 --> 17:48.300
[laughter]

17:48.300 --> 17:49.660
What did you think?

17:49.660 --> 17:51.300
Well that's why I'm
saying it was eye-opening

17:51.300 --> 17:53.170
to see myself being that way.

17:53.170 --> 17:56.670
And I feel like the competition
wore me all the way out.

17:56.670 --> 17:59.440
When I came in I felt
like I was a capital T.

17:59.440 --> 18:02.940
Baby, I left feeling
like a lowercase S.

18:02.940 --> 18:06.610
[laughter]

18:08.250 --> 18:09.850
Would you do it differently?

18:09.850 --> 18:11.590
What I would do differently is

18:11.590 --> 18:14.790
not focus so much
of my energy on the girls.

18:14.790 --> 18:16.660
Because what I was hearing was
a lot of positive feedback

18:16.660 --> 18:17.890
for the other girls,

18:17.890 --> 18:20.560
and I was like...
I wasn't getting that.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.330
It was very much
"I don't see you.

18:22.330 --> 18:23.560
"Where are you?
Where you here?

18:23.560 --> 18:26.770
You're invisible,
you're unmemorable."

18:26.770 --> 18:29.670
So that like,
kept playing in my head.

18:29.670 --> 18:31.040
You're unmemorable.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.470
Like, we want more.
And I was thinking more was...

18:33.470 --> 18:35.810
I need to go pull some
more drag up out the closet.

18:35.810 --> 18:38.250
But I forgot I was supposed to
be pulling up out of myself

18:38.250 --> 18:41.050
as opposed to just being,
having my guard up.

18:41.050 --> 18:42.580
Yeah, no, I understand.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.250
Because it is a competition

18:44.250 --> 18:46.290
and when the stakes get really
high, what happens is...

18:46.290 --> 18:49.190
as humans we go
into attack mode.

18:49.190 --> 18:51.130
And after Plastique got
attention from me

18:51.130 --> 18:55.100
and Alyssa Edwards,
you snapped big-time.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.130
I did.

18:56.130 --> 18:59.400
-Bye.
-I love you.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.540
Girl, obviously they're trying
to get you to the top four,

19:01.540 --> 19:03.770
because you got
your mama comin',

19:03.770 --> 19:06.340
you got Ru calling you
her child.

19:06.340 --> 19:08.140
You got your boyfriend
popping up on the video.

19:08.140 --> 19:10.010
So bitch,
just take it as like,

19:10.010 --> 19:11.980
thank you,
I'm getting encouraged.

19:11.980 --> 19:14.180
Like, what the fuck
is that about?

19:17.350 --> 19:19.220
[RuPaul] Now, is there anything
you wanna say about that?

19:19.220 --> 19:21.320
[sighs]

19:21.320 --> 19:23.190
That for me...

19:23.190 --> 19:26.690
and I don't want to look--

19:26.690 --> 19:28.030
Shit.

19:28.030 --> 19:29.660
I think the problem
that I had on the show

19:29.660 --> 19:31.000
is the same problem
that I'm having right now.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
I don't wanna be vulnerable.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.200
I don't want to cry.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.840
I don't want to show weakness.

19:34.840 --> 19:39.510
But that was
a hard two weeks for me.

19:39.510 --> 19:42.110
During that moment,

19:42.110 --> 19:44.950
a lot of people asked me
why I didn't snap back.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.610
Because when I looked
into your eyes,

19:46.610 --> 19:49.880
I could see,
it wasn't about me.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.020
Hurt people hurt people.

19:51.020 --> 19:52.850
So I'm sorry that
I hurt you, sister.

19:52.850 --> 19:54.320
I truly love you.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.420
I was at a point where I
needed to speak to somebody

19:56.420 --> 19:58.330
that knew me, loved me.

19:58.330 --> 19:59.490
Why didn't you say that?

19:59.490 --> 20:00.530
I did say that.

20:00.530 --> 20:01.900
But what I'm saying is,

20:01.900 --> 20:04.100
you wanted to push off
your vulnerability.

20:04.100 --> 20:06.530
Why not from now on,

20:06.530 --> 20:09.300
show the vulnerability,
and not be ashamed of it.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.310
Well, you know what, that's
the thing that I'm working on.

20:11.310 --> 20:12.570
I'm a Capricorn
first and foremost.

20:12.570 --> 20:14.780
Capricorns are like
stubborn people.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.810
We are like stuck in our ways.

20:16.810 --> 20:18.280
We clash with people
all the time

20:18.280 --> 20:20.250
just because the wall is up.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.950
So in a situation
like me and Yvie had,

20:22.950 --> 20:25.790
the way to get my walls down
is pulling each brick out.

20:25.790 --> 20:27.990
Don't just beat my walls down.

20:27.990 --> 20:30.390
-Beat your walls down?
-Take it slow, girl.

20:30.390 --> 20:31.990
[laughter]
Use some grease, bitch.

20:31.990 --> 20:33.960
[laughter]

20:33.960 --> 20:36.300
And I just wanna say,

20:36.300 --> 20:37.670
to clear the air,

20:37.670 --> 20:39.500
I did not instigate
that situation.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.200
Ra'Jah asked me a question
at that moment.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.170
I explained to her
what I saw.

20:43.170 --> 20:44.910
And I even said that on camera.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.980
And how she handled it
was all on her.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.680
But watching it back,

20:49.680 --> 20:53.250
you instigated every single
problem that I had.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.180
Oh!

20:55.180 --> 20:58.120
[A'keria] So, it came back
that Plastique had said,

20:58.120 --> 20:59.690
"Those are my wigs
that Ariel left for me

20:59.690 --> 21:01.820
-because they were in my area."
-Oh.

21:01.820 --> 21:04.130
-"But it's okay because
those girls need it."

21:07.730 --> 21:09.100
So, Ariel, are you
all best friends

21:09.100 --> 21:10.130
and did you leave
the wigs for her?

21:12.370 --> 21:13.500
See, that's the thing.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.670
A lot of people say
I instigate it.

21:14.670 --> 21:16.500
Ra'Jah asked me
a question on what I saw.

21:16.500 --> 21:19.810
I said, Plastique's boyfriend
came on camera,

21:19.810 --> 21:21.740
he said something
about her family

21:21.740 --> 21:23.280
was congratulating her.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.910
And I left it at that
and even then,

21:24.910 --> 21:27.550
before Ra'Jah took off,
you also noticed on camera

21:27.550 --> 21:29.050
I said at least that's
what I heard.

21:29.050 --> 21:31.890
She asked me a question.
I never went to Ra'Jah,

21:31.890 --> 21:34.050
and said, "Hey, girl,
Plastique's boyfriend

21:34.050 --> 21:35.490
just said X, Y, and Z."

21:53.870 --> 21:56.610
[Plastique] But the week
afterwards in Untucked,

21:56.610 --> 22:00.210
I asked you why Ra'Jah
reacted the way,

22:00.210 --> 22:02.480
and you just stared
blankly into my face.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.590
No, I said because
a lot of us girls

22:04.590 --> 22:06.490
feel some type of way
about your story,

22:06.490 --> 22:08.020
and we don't understand
your story completely.

22:08.020 --> 22:09.590
[Yvie] That's a good way
to play off any blame

22:09.590 --> 22:10.760
for yourself, though, girl.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.430
That's exactly
what Silky was doing

22:12.430 --> 22:13.730
when we got in
that first fight

22:13.730 --> 22:15.560
and I was speaking
to Silky about the things--

22:15.560 --> 22:16.900
But you never said you--

22:16.900 --> 22:18.070
[Shuga] Yeah, when I watched
it back I was like,

22:18.070 --> 22:20.170
why is she saying
I heard from some girls

22:20.170 --> 22:22.070
when, like,
I'd heard it from you

22:22.070 --> 22:23.900
that you were concerned about
some inconsistencies.

22:23.900 --> 22:25.010
When I saw that back,
I was like,

22:25.010 --> 22:26.410
"Why isn't she
owning up to this?

22:26.410 --> 22:27.540
[A'Keria] Okay, let's be clear,
a lot of us girls

22:27.540 --> 22:29.610
has had a conversation
or had some words

22:29.610 --> 22:31.210
about Plastique's story,

22:31.210 --> 22:32.450
or how it didn't add up.

22:32.450 --> 22:34.820
So it was not just
a me situation.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.850
-[Soju] Who was confused?
-But in the--

22:36.850 --> 22:38.620
I said that in my interview,

22:38.620 --> 22:40.020
that I was confused
and at that point

22:40.020 --> 22:41.220
I just did not know.

22:41.220 --> 22:43.160
But I don't get why
it was so confusing.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.790
[A'Keria] 'Cause at the time
as things were going,

22:45.790 --> 22:47.360
like, I said, a lot of stuff...

22:47.360 --> 22:48.530
When we're in
certain situations,

22:48.530 --> 22:50.030
a lot of stuff didn't add up.

22:50.030 --> 22:52.070
And I said that,
in my opinion,

22:52.070 --> 22:53.570
a lot of things
did not add up

22:53.570 --> 22:56.040
because at some moments
when you were in a situation

22:56.040 --> 22:58.940
where you were at
the bottom or something,

22:58.940 --> 23:00.810
it seemed like
an excuse came about.

23:00.810 --> 23:04.310
I don't know that you had,
like, a real love for Mariah.

23:04.310 --> 23:06.550
I only found out
about pop culture

23:06.550 --> 23:08.720
about like three years ago.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.180
Really?

23:10.180 --> 23:11.250
Yeah.

23:11.250 --> 23:13.050
Do they not know
Mariah in Vietnam?

23:13.050 --> 23:14.150
No, girl.

23:14.150 --> 23:17.730
I came over
when I was 11, but...

23:17.730 --> 23:20.330
I found out about Beyoncé,
legit, four years ago.

23:23.100 --> 23:26.230
I've told the same story
over and over and over again.

23:26.230 --> 23:28.140
And it's just
really aggravating

23:28.140 --> 23:32.270
even on TV, people,
the audience seemed to get it.

23:32.270 --> 23:34.240
Well, I don't have anything
to say about your personal life

23:34.240 --> 23:36.480
or your family life
and I won't also speak to

23:36.480 --> 23:38.250
your experience as
an immigrant,

23:38.250 --> 23:40.750
uh, in terms of what you do
or don't know about pop culture.

23:40.750 --> 23:43.580
I will say it came off
as an excuse when it happened.

23:43.580 --> 23:46.090
And that's what my problem was
as your teammate,

23:46.090 --> 23:48.760
trying our best to
celebrate Mariah Carey.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.090
And failing miserably.

23:51.090 --> 23:53.460
Emphasis on trying, I guess.

23:53.460 --> 23:55.560
Uh, you know, it just
came off as an excuse

23:55.560 --> 23:58.130
that you didn't know
even Beyoncé.

23:58.130 --> 24:00.470
Um, and I think that you are

24:00.470 --> 24:02.740
probably the most
pop culture literate

24:02.740 --> 24:04.310
of this entire cast current.

24:04.310 --> 24:05.940
That's why I say
it wasn't a personal attack.

24:05.940 --> 24:07.540
Do you think you were
a shit-stirrer, though?

24:07.540 --> 24:08.710
-No.
-You don't?

24:08.710 --> 24:10.610
No, that's why I honestly
let it go, like,

24:10.610 --> 24:13.780
I just admitted to myself that
I was confused in the moment

24:13.780 --> 24:16.080
because I genuinely
wanted to get to know you.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.950
Outside of the show,
we have grew a bond

24:17.950 --> 24:19.190
and we were actually close.

24:19.190 --> 24:21.520
Yeah, that's what
I thought, too.

24:21.520 --> 24:24.560
You were one of the girls
who I had considered

24:24.560 --> 24:26.230
one of my good friends
for this show.

24:26.230 --> 24:28.530
-Yeah.
-But as a viewer,

24:28.530 --> 24:30.860
after I got back,
it really hurt me

24:30.860 --> 24:34.440
because I thought I had
a great relationship with you,

24:34.440 --> 24:38.240
you, and it just...

24:38.240 --> 24:40.740
I didn't see what was going on
behind my back.

24:40.740 --> 24:43.340
I didn't see
what you said to her

24:43.340 --> 24:45.280
that made that whole
fight started.

24:45.280 --> 24:47.920
Ra'Jah saw me walking
back to my station,

24:47.920 --> 24:49.450
she asked me what did I see.

24:49.450 --> 24:52.420
I explained to her because
if you look at the--

24:52.420 --> 24:53.450
All right, all right,
all right, we got it.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.790
We're going to
wrap this up.

24:54.790 --> 24:57.790
Next, now two of
the season's biggest characters

24:57.790 --> 25:01.960
also delivered some of
the season's biggest conflama.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.030
And we loved every minute of it.

25:04.030 --> 25:05.270
Take a look.

25:06.470 --> 25:08.670
I was in the bottom
for being beautiful.

25:08.670 --> 25:10.600
So you know what?
It works for me.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.010
And if I've got
to lip sync for my life,

25:12.010 --> 25:14.340
I'ma lip sync for my
motherfucking life beautifully.

25:14.340 --> 25:17.280
But, like, Ru's been
particularly poignant

25:17.280 --> 25:19.750
about don't be safe.

25:19.750 --> 25:22.580
I would never be spooky,
but bitch,

25:22.580 --> 25:24.020
would you ever be glam?

25:24.020 --> 25:26.290
You will never be glam!
Don't come for me.

25:26.290 --> 25:27.820
Oh, girl, I hope you're not
talking to me,

25:27.820 --> 25:29.420
because I'm about to
send your ass packing.

25:30.860 --> 25:32.390
I think Yvie should go home

25:32.390 --> 25:35.760
just because she's hurt,
and we ain't got time for that.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.830
Oh!

25:37.830 --> 25:39.770
You tried to throw me
under the bus

25:39.770 --> 25:42.900
for a pre-existing
condition, bitch.

25:42.900 --> 25:44.340
I can't with you.

25:44.340 --> 25:46.470
I don't really care for you,

25:46.470 --> 25:47.940
and it's not
because of your drag,

25:47.940 --> 25:49.440
it's you as a person.
-[Yvie] I literally don't care

25:49.440 --> 25:51.750
if you don't care for me because
your drag is not quality, bitch.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.420
Okay. Alpha Dumpster
and his quality, but okay.

25:54.420 --> 25:57.020
Let's give pats on the back
to mediocrity and beans.

25:57.020 --> 25:59.450
I can't wait to see
your ass in the bottom.

25:59.450 --> 26:00.920
I can't wait to see me
in the bottom next to you

26:00.920 --> 26:03.190
so I can send your ass home.

26:03.190 --> 26:04.760
-You didn't say that. You said--
-Right.

26:04.760 --> 26:05.990
I didn't want to be a big bitch!

26:05.990 --> 26:08.430
Well, girl, you're being
a big bitch now, then,

26:08.430 --> 26:10.060
by bringing it up
now after.

26:10.060 --> 26:11.670
Because you're putting
words in my mouth.

26:11.670 --> 26:14.370
If I would've lip synced for
my motherfucking life today,

26:14.370 --> 26:17.770
bitch, I was
motherfucking ready!

26:19.710 --> 26:21.940
Oh, my goodness.

26:21.940 --> 26:25.150
Now, wait a minute.
Now, Yvie and Silky,

26:25.150 --> 26:29.950
y'all had several many feuds
this season, why?

26:29.950 --> 26:31.750
Why do you think
there was such a clash

26:31.750 --> 26:32.920
between the two of you?

26:32.920 --> 26:34.790
Well, I mean, I would call
you, Silky, out,

26:34.790 --> 26:37.690
because you were always
resistant to critiques.

26:37.690 --> 26:39.890
There were moments where
you would just, like,

26:39.890 --> 26:41.860
get from the bottom and be like,

26:41.860 --> 26:43.660
"Bitch, I don't understand
why I was there.

26:43.660 --> 26:45.470
"Bitch, if I have to lip sync
the whole way to the crown,

26:45.470 --> 26:46.500
I'ma do it."

26:46.500 --> 26:48.940
I felt like you
would just, like,

26:48.940 --> 26:52.670
casually, like, walk around,
not even try in the challenge,

26:52.670 --> 26:54.980
or if you knew that you
nailed the challenge,

26:54.980 --> 26:56.480
you wouldn't try
on the runway.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.380
And when the judges
would be like,

26:58.380 --> 26:59.550
"Silky, you look like a roach,"

26:59.550 --> 27:01.150
you would be like,
"Well, fuck no,

27:01.150 --> 27:02.220
I thought I looked beautiful."

27:02.220 --> 27:04.050
Like, not specifically
that week,

27:04.050 --> 27:05.850
but that was like
the base of it.

27:05.850 --> 27:08.020
So that's why Yvie
was getting in at you.

27:08.020 --> 27:10.120
Why were you going
in on Yvie?

27:10.120 --> 27:12.530
I didn't need, like,
at the time

27:12.530 --> 27:14.860
my business spread out
to everybody

27:14.860 --> 27:16.360
because, you know...

27:16.360 --> 27:20.330
Love all you now,
but I don't trust you ho's.

27:20.330 --> 27:22.570
And that's just
the reality to it,

27:22.570 --> 27:24.910
because I don't know what
your intentions are.

27:24.910 --> 27:26.840
We are here for the same thing.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.610
Like, when I was having
body issues,

27:28.610 --> 27:29.740
people may not
realize this,

27:29.740 --> 27:31.480
I gained 30 pounds filming.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.550
And that's why I had
to many body issues.

27:33.550 --> 27:35.120
While we were
filming this show?

27:35.120 --> 27:37.180
-While we were filming.
-Munch, munch, crunch, crunch.

27:37.180 --> 27:38.890
Like, oh, what can I do?

27:38.890 --> 27:41.320
Because we can't go out
and I just can't go get new foam

27:41.320 --> 27:42.790
and make new pads.

27:42.790 --> 27:44.420
I had to use what I had.

27:44.420 --> 27:46.360
There was foam there.
I mean, to be fair,

27:46.360 --> 27:48.330
there was foam there 'cause
I was told to correct my body

27:48.330 --> 27:50.300
and I corrected my body.

27:50.300 --> 27:53.000
The harshest criticisms
that I had to give

27:53.000 --> 27:55.840
were when people were being
the most resistant to growing,

27:55.840 --> 27:58.070
so I was reading everybody
all the time

27:58.070 --> 27:59.810
just like we're all reading
everybody all the time.

27:59.810 --> 28:01.680
It was all cute,
but I just have

28:01.680 --> 28:03.540
a very low tolerance
for bullshit.

28:03.540 --> 28:05.980
If you're sitting
there ignoring the facts,

28:05.980 --> 28:07.510
I'm going to be the one
who's like,

28:07.510 --> 28:08.950
"Bitch, those aren't the facts."

28:08.950 --> 28:11.250
But it's very hard
to admit when you're wrong

28:11.250 --> 28:12.650
when all eyes are on you,
you know what I mean?

28:12.650 --> 28:13.950
It's very hard, you know
everyone's looking at you

28:13.950 --> 28:15.290
and judging at you.

28:15.290 --> 28:17.420
Well, why not pull them
to the side, then--

28:17.420 --> 28:20.560
Because we didn't get brought
here to go and try to have

28:20.560 --> 28:22.600
these sneaky-ass conversations
off camera.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.530
Bitch, we are on a TV show.

28:24.530 --> 28:26.270
But we're on a competition
TV show.

28:26.270 --> 28:27.530
-Yeah.
-So I don't know why

28:27.530 --> 28:29.040
you're so concerned about
your competition.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.240
Well, what she's saying
is that the Emperor

28:31.240 --> 28:32.470
is not wearing any clothes.

28:32.470 --> 28:34.710
And she couldn't stand
the delusion

28:34.710 --> 28:36.840
after hearing what the judges
had to say,

28:36.840 --> 28:39.180
for girls to come back
to the workroom or wherever

28:39.180 --> 28:41.720
and say, "I don't understand
what they're talking about."

28:41.720 --> 28:43.850
Well, the judges just told you
what they're talking about.

28:43.850 --> 28:45.090
That's what she's saying.

28:45.090 --> 28:49.060
So, Yvie, was the most
hurtful thing, uh...

28:49.060 --> 28:52.230
Silky said that you should go
home because of your illness?

28:52.230 --> 28:53.190
That was...

28:55.160 --> 28:57.700
For me, that was
just painful because

28:57.700 --> 28:59.330
I know that she was
just talking about, like,

28:59.330 --> 29:00.770
my sprained ankle or whatever.

29:00.770 --> 29:02.970
I didn't know that you had
the disease at that time.

29:02.970 --> 29:06.270
So, I honestly said that
just talking shit.

29:06.270 --> 29:08.440
And I never thought
that you woulda got

29:08.440 --> 29:10.680
upset about it,
but later I realized

29:10.680 --> 29:13.750
why you got upset about it
so I want to apologize to you.

29:13.750 --> 29:17.650
In this competition I've had to
put up such a hard exterior,

29:17.650 --> 29:21.990
you know, to kind
of protect myself.

29:21.990 --> 29:25.460
Your personality,
I think, is your shield,

29:25.460 --> 29:28.060
-just like my claws are mine.
-Right. Absolutely.

29:28.060 --> 29:30.730
So, our defense mechanisms
were always up

29:30.730 --> 29:32.330
and always at odds.

29:32.330 --> 29:35.470
Silky and Yvie,
dare I say you are two of

29:35.470 --> 29:39.170
the most fascinating queens
in Drag Race herstory.

29:39.170 --> 29:42.040
-And you are stars.
-Say it again, baby.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.610
Don't let anybody take that
away from you.

29:43.610 --> 29:46.210
We will be right back.

29:46.210 --> 29:47.680
-♪ Queens! ♪
-♪ Everywhere, everyhere ♪

29:47.680 --> 29:48.950
[RuPaul] Welcome back.

29:48.950 --> 29:51.520
Now, this next queen
brought her magic touch

29:51.520 --> 29:55.090
and became the pride
of Season 11.

29:55.090 --> 29:56.460
Take a look.

29:56.460 --> 30:00.930
It looks like things
just got 11-dudery.

30:00.930 --> 30:02.800
It's been a long time coming.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.130
I've seen a lot
of audition reels from you.

30:05.130 --> 30:06.130
Nine years.

30:06.130 --> 30:07.930
Testify, sister.

30:07.930 --> 30:09.070
[RuPaul] Ooh, girl.

30:09.070 --> 30:10.200
Big unh!

30:10.200 --> 30:13.170
I call her Paula,
and I keep her hidden.

30:13.170 --> 30:15.540
-I want to clear things up.
-Okay.

30:15.540 --> 30:18.750
-I'm not Harvey Weinstein.
-No, you're not, no.

30:18.750 --> 30:21.080
The only thing I've assaulted
is a cheese plate.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.780
[all laugh]
Yeah.

30:22.780 --> 30:24.020
[Michelle] You were,

30:24.020 --> 30:25.990
from beginning
to the end, hysterical.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.750
[whispers] Magic.

30:27.750 --> 30:28.760
[all laugh]

30:28.760 --> 30:30.560
You have that campy look,

30:30.560 --> 30:32.690
and it separates you
from the other girls.

30:32.690 --> 30:34.260
We live in a culture right now

30:34.260 --> 30:36.200
where divisive rhetoric
is winning.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.730
It is our responsibility

30:37.730 --> 30:40.730
to create the world
that we want to live in.

30:40.730 --> 30:42.100
Hallelujah.

30:42.100 --> 30:46.570
You, my dear,
are the pride of Season 11.

30:48.840 --> 30:50.210
[applause]

30:50.210 --> 30:52.980
Nina, your elimination

30:52.980 --> 30:56.080
really broke hearts
around the world.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.420
Did you ever think

30:57.420 --> 30:59.390
you'd have such a powerful
connection with fans?

30:59.390 --> 31:00.590
Are you kidding me? No.

31:00.590 --> 31:02.520
It's tremendous
to have the opportunity

31:02.520 --> 31:04.860
to tell my story with you.

31:04.860 --> 31:06.230
I hope you know
how much you mean to me

31:06.230 --> 31:08.860
and what you meant to me
as a queer young boy.

31:08.860 --> 31:10.460
Well, the restraining order
is still intact.

31:10.460 --> 31:11.470
[Nina] I know, I know.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.530
-They moved my seat over.
-Yeah.

31:13.530 --> 31:14.530
[all laugh]

31:14.530 --> 31:16.500
Now, Nina, one of your superfans

31:16.500 --> 31:18.370
is a queen from Queens

31:18.370 --> 31:21.810
who spends a lot of time
in Washington, D.C.

31:21.810 --> 31:22.810
Take a look.

31:22.810 --> 31:26.080
I am so sad.

31:26.080 --> 31:29.380
I mean, I don't want
to do spoilers, but, oh.

31:29.380 --> 31:31.050
Well, again, no spoilers,

31:31.050 --> 31:33.050
but to the queen
that went home this week,

31:33.050 --> 31:40.290
just know how important you are
to the bigger picture.

31:40.290 --> 31:42.660
And I'm so proud of you

31:42.660 --> 31:46.670
and your fundamental kindness
and goodness.

31:46.670 --> 31:52.440
And I'm just really looking
forward to watching you grow.

31:52.440 --> 31:55.940
And you're amazing,

31:55.940 --> 31:59.710
and I'm sad,
but I'm excited for you.

31:59.710 --> 32:02.820
Oh, my goodness.

32:02.820 --> 32:05.750
Oh, my goodness.
Are you down with AOC?

32:05.750 --> 32:08.420
-Yeah, you know me.
-Okay.

32:08.420 --> 32:10.620
-How does that make you feel?
-Are you kidding me?

32:10.620 --> 32:13.560
As an activist and as someone
who's politically engaged,

32:13.560 --> 32:16.260
that was the greatest thing,
I think,

32:16.260 --> 32:17.600
that could have come from this.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.070
This idea that someone like her

32:19.070 --> 32:22.340
a year ago was serving tables
in a restaurant,

32:22.340 --> 32:24.440
and she never gave up
on her dream.

32:24.440 --> 32:27.240
And the fact that
she even noticed me

32:27.240 --> 32:31.710
and celebrated me and
celebrates me, is tremendous.

32:31.710 --> 32:32.810
Well, she's not the only one.

32:32.810 --> 32:35.220
Didn't Rihanna
slip into your DMs?

32:35.220 --> 32:37.180
[laughs] She did.

32:37.180 --> 32:39.590
I mean,
when you're going from--

32:39.590 --> 32:41.350
You go on Twitter
and somebody says,

32:41.350 --> 32:42.560
oh, Rihanna's following you
on Instagram.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.990
I was like, no, she's not.

32:43.990 --> 32:45.730
And then I look,
I'm going through my messages,

32:45.730 --> 32:47.990
and all of a sudden
a DM pops up.

32:47.990 --> 32:49.430
So she's on the other end
of the phone.

32:49.430 --> 32:50.760
Oh, my goodness.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.800
And I'm like, "Oh, my God."

32:52.800 --> 32:55.440
I showed the girls.
I was like, this isn't real.

32:55.440 --> 32:58.040
And to have the impact
that I've had

32:58.040 --> 33:00.570
on people who have
already seen the world,

33:00.570 --> 33:03.410
and done tremendous things
and have had an impact on me,

33:03.410 --> 33:05.610
and the lives
of millions of other people,

33:05.610 --> 33:07.980
is humbling and it's amazing

33:07.980 --> 33:09.850
and it wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for you

33:09.850 --> 33:12.150
or for this show.

33:12.150 --> 33:14.320
And the bravery
that you lead with

33:14.320 --> 33:17.120
allows all of us
to have a voice

33:17.120 --> 33:18.860
and to have strength
in ourselves

33:18.860 --> 33:20.260
to continue this legacy.

33:20.260 --> 33:21.800
I hope you know
how much it means.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.460
-Thank you.
-To all of us, you know.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.000
Yes. Yes, thank you.
[applause]

33:26.000 --> 33:27.600
Nina for president.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.070
[all laugh]
Not me, bitch, not me.

33:29.070 --> 33:30.300
No, she's running.

33:30.300 --> 33:31.670
I'm going to be
her running mate.

33:31.670 --> 33:33.810
No, no, it's really--
it is very special.

33:33.810 --> 33:38.480
And I've been in the drag game
for a long time

33:38.480 --> 33:39.710
and I've played all the clubs.

33:39.710 --> 33:42.080
I've done all the touring
and all that stuff.

33:42.080 --> 33:43.920
So I know exactly
what you're saying,

33:43.920 --> 33:46.820
and I do take that
and hold it close to my heart.

33:46.820 --> 33:48.290
Thank you, mother.

33:48.290 --> 33:50.860
Now, just after six episodes,

33:50.860 --> 33:53.860
Drag Race fans caught
a case of Scarlet Fever.

33:53.860 --> 33:54.860
Take a look.

33:56.500 --> 34:01.670
The world wants me,
and the feeling is mutual.

34:01.670 --> 34:04.070
A lot of the girls
said that my dress

34:04.070 --> 34:06.040
was something that
they would actually wear.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.380
Scarlet is delusional.

34:10.380 --> 34:11.910
I would say
this is a beautiful dress,

34:11.910 --> 34:14.210
but I see tons of holes.

34:14.210 --> 34:16.620
[all laugh]

34:19.090 --> 34:23.420
That leaves Scarlet Envy
and Ariel Versace.

34:23.420 --> 34:25.090
Ariel, come be part
of this world.

34:26.130 --> 34:28.130
I should not be the last pick,

34:28.130 --> 34:30.730
especially
on an acting challenge.

34:30.730 --> 34:33.030
I am Julia Roberts
in Pretty Woman.

34:33.030 --> 34:36.900
Big mistake. Huge.

34:39.340 --> 34:42.280
I feel like this is actually
really terrifying, right?

34:42.280 --> 34:44.110
Scarlet is definitely
feeling herself.

34:44.110 --> 34:47.180
She's walking up and down
this joint in her own world.

34:47.180 --> 34:49.720
She's back in the workroom.

34:49.720 --> 34:52.320
What the fuck is that?

34:52.320 --> 34:55.960
Somebody give her a mirror,
darling.

34:55.960 --> 34:58.190
Yeah, it ain't working for me.

34:58.190 --> 34:59.830
[all laugh]

34:59.830 --> 35:02.500
[applause]

35:02.500 --> 35:04.830
So, Scarlet, were you shocked

35:04.830 --> 35:06.270
by what the other queens
said about you?

35:06.270 --> 35:07.600
Well, I would say surprised.

35:07.600 --> 35:08.900
Well, I heard that Brooke Lynn

35:08.900 --> 35:10.240
said something
at a viewing party

35:10.240 --> 35:12.470
that ruffled your feathers.
What was it?

35:12.470 --> 35:16.380
I think she said
that the entire cast--

35:16.380 --> 35:20.980
I think she actually used
the word "hate", hated me.

35:20.980 --> 35:22.080
Really?

35:22.080 --> 35:24.650
Well, that's what was said,
yeah.

35:24.650 --> 35:25.920
Is that what was said?

35:25.920 --> 35:27.150
Mm-hmm.

35:27.150 --> 35:28.660
Did the whole cast hate her?

35:28.660 --> 35:31.090
I personally did not enjoy
Scarlet on the show.

35:31.090 --> 35:33.360
You just rubbed me
the wrong way.

35:33.360 --> 35:36.530
That's what's confusing to me
is that I just don't know why.

35:36.530 --> 35:38.570
I really don't. I mean,
I know that I was confident.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.100
It was cocky,
it wasn't confidence.

35:40.100 --> 35:43.040
You were just--you came across
very cocky and very arrogant,

35:43.040 --> 35:44.670
and you were constantly
trying to kind of just one up.

35:44.670 --> 35:46.340
There was always
little comments.

35:46.340 --> 35:48.310
I don't know if it was a game
you were playing or whatever,

35:48.310 --> 35:51.110
but it just ruffled my feathers.

35:51.110 --> 35:52.910
And when I said that
at the viewing party,

35:52.910 --> 35:56.280
in all truth, like, I wasn't sad
to see you go when you went,

35:56.280 --> 35:59.490
because on the show,
I didn't care for you too much

35:59.490 --> 36:00.890
and I felt like
we didn't get along.

36:00.890 --> 36:02.720
And I know
a lot of the other girls

36:02.720 --> 36:04.120
felt the same way as I did.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.490
But that was not my place
to speak for them.

36:06.490 --> 36:07.930
Who else felt that way?

36:07.930 --> 36:09.030
Anybody?

36:09.030 --> 36:11.030
Oh, Ra'Jah.
Big surprise.

36:11.030 --> 36:12.330
[all laugh]

36:12.330 --> 36:15.970
I would say I was really
kinda annoyed with Scarlet

36:15.970 --> 36:20.640
because to me, every situation,

36:20.640 --> 36:23.010
Scarlet had an anecdote
and a story for

36:23.010 --> 36:25.350
that somehow related to her.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.750
Well, duh.
[all laugh]

36:27.750 --> 36:28.880
Isn't that why we're here?

36:28.880 --> 36:30.250
That's why we're all here.

36:30.250 --> 36:32.390
Have you heard that
from people in general before?

36:32.390 --> 36:33.750
No, I haven't.

36:33.750 --> 36:38.630
And maybe I was as delusional
as I was said I was.

36:38.630 --> 36:39.930
And if that's the case,

36:39.930 --> 36:40.930
I invite everyone
to live in my world.

36:40.930 --> 36:42.300
It's a really fun place to be.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.030
[Brooke Lynn]
At that viewing party,

36:44.030 --> 36:45.700
I should never have said hate,

36:45.700 --> 36:47.200
because hate is just a word
that came to mind,

36:47.200 --> 36:49.200
because I didn't like you,
but I didn't obviously hate you.

36:49.200 --> 36:50.600
In a club situation, you know,

36:50.600 --> 36:53.140
you have a few cocktails,
you know, and you work your--

36:53.140 --> 36:55.810
Actually,
she was drinking water.

36:55.810 --> 36:58.110
Yeah, I was--
I was sober that night.

36:58.110 --> 36:59.310
[RuPaul]
Well, Scarlet, darling,

36:59.310 --> 37:01.050
if anyone has a problem
with you,

37:01.050 --> 37:02.380
you just look at them and say,

37:02.380 --> 37:04.320
"Frankly, my dear,
I don't give a damn."

37:04.320 --> 37:06.850
[laughter and applause]

37:06.850 --> 37:07.720
We'll be right back.

37:10.360 --> 37:13.190
Welcome back to
RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.

37:13.190 --> 37:16.400
Now, for our queens,
success today

37:16.400 --> 37:19.600
is often measured
by their social media following,

37:19.600 --> 37:21.400
which has led to a divide

37:21.400 --> 37:24.940
between so-called social media
queens and showgirls.

37:24.940 --> 37:29.080
Plastique, you have like
over a million followers.

37:29.080 --> 37:32.050
Do you consider yourself
a Mistress of Social Media?

37:32.050 --> 37:34.050
[all laugh]

37:34.050 --> 37:35.120
How many did you have

37:35.120 --> 37:36.420
before you came into
the competition?

37:36.420 --> 37:39.720
Before I came into
the competition, I had 100.

37:39.720 --> 37:40.720
-100.000.
-100.000.

37:40.720 --> 37:41.960
When I started drag,

37:41.960 --> 37:44.620
I couldn't perform on stage
under 21.

37:44.620 --> 37:46.830
That's what drove me
into social media.

37:46.830 --> 37:47.990
You're the youngest
of all of us, right?

37:47.990 --> 37:49.730
-Yes.
-With the most following.

37:49.730 --> 37:51.630
[RuPaul]
Yeah. Ariel and Soju,

37:51.630 --> 37:53.700
you both arrived with big
social media followings.

37:53.700 --> 37:55.000
Yeah.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.500
Did the other girls
give you shade for that?

37:56.500 --> 37:58.540
I think, I mean,
like, watching it now,

37:58.540 --> 38:01.040
I think they kind of
put us in a box

38:01.040 --> 38:03.740
where we can't perform,
we can't act,

38:03.740 --> 38:06.550
we're not a comedy queen,
we're only here for looks.

38:06.550 --> 38:08.350
And, yes, we're here for looks,

38:08.350 --> 38:10.620
but we can also do
the other things, too.

38:10.620 --> 38:13.920
But the one that was reading you
was Ariel in the first episode.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.590
But do you like consider
yourself an entertainer,

38:15.590 --> 38:17.360
or just like
kind of like a blogger?

38:17.360 --> 38:18.590
Oh, shit.

38:18.590 --> 38:21.090
Full entertainer, okay?

38:21.090 --> 38:23.230
I know Soju from online.

38:23.230 --> 38:25.270
She's not much of a performer.

38:25.270 --> 38:27.300
So I'm like, girl,
why are you here?

38:27.300 --> 38:30.600
It did hurt
to hear now my friend,

38:30.600 --> 38:31.840
you know, say that about me.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.110
And I thought that was
a little bit ironic.

38:33.110 --> 38:34.670
I had never seen Soju perform,

38:34.670 --> 38:35.940
and I knew that she was
a little bit of a newer queen.

38:35.940 --> 38:38.610
Like, she wasn't like
as seasoned as I thought.

38:38.610 --> 38:40.310
And now that I know Soju,
she's amazing.

38:40.310 --> 38:42.120
I mean, I bite my tongue now

38:42.120 --> 38:43.550
because Soju's
one of my best friends.

38:43.550 --> 38:45.390
But any of the showgirls
give them shade

38:45.390 --> 38:47.950
for being social media queens?

38:47.950 --> 38:49.820
[Ra'Jah] I didn't throw shade,

38:49.820 --> 38:54.660
but I do feel the importance
of having that showgirl essence,

38:54.660 --> 38:58.000
because everything that we do
is turned on on stage.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.770
Y'all can tell me I'm wrong,
and I don't care.

38:59.770 --> 39:02.140
I still don't feel like
anybody on this season

39:02.140 --> 39:04.170
is just a social media queen.

39:04.170 --> 39:08.070
I think that we are all
equally hardworking as hell.

39:08.070 --> 39:09.310
You just have to know

39:09.310 --> 39:10.480
that there's two different sides
of everything.

39:10.480 --> 39:12.780
We're doing brand deals,
promotions.

39:12.780 --> 39:15.010
You're showing your personality
in a whole different way.

39:15.010 --> 39:18.920
Yeah. Well, if you're not
caught up on this season,

39:18.920 --> 39:20.620
spoiler alert.

39:20.620 --> 39:24.520
These crazy bitches
will fight over anything,

39:24.520 --> 39:28.330
starting with the mystery
of Ariel's wigs.

39:28.330 --> 39:30.000
[A'Keria]
I got a lot to say.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.500
Ariel's eliminated.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.700
We came back in, the station
was still full of wigs.

39:34.700 --> 39:36.370
A couple of the girls,
including myself,

39:36.370 --> 39:38.170
grabbed a wig or two.

39:38.170 --> 39:39.910
Had you and Ariel
had the conversation

39:39.910 --> 39:42.410
about her leaving you hair
or anything like that?

39:42.410 --> 39:43.440
-Uh-uh.
-Did you she write you a note?

39:43.440 --> 39:46.910
No. But we were best friends.

39:46.910 --> 39:50.380
Speaking of hair, I hear
some of my hair's gone.

39:50.380 --> 39:52.290
Right.
What happened with that?

39:52.290 --> 39:54.250
Girl, I just left it
by accident.

39:54.250 --> 39:56.520
I want to know who the hell's
snatching up my damn wigs.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.660
So, Lucy, they got
some 'splaining to do.

39:58.660 --> 39:59.990
Your black wig
and your purple wig

39:59.990 --> 40:01.230
is right there in my station.

40:01.230 --> 40:02.600
No, no, I don't care
about the purple wig.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.270
I know that Miss Ra'Jah
left with a bunch of them.

40:05.270 --> 40:08.330
Only wig I knew Ra'Jah had
was the big purple crinkly one.

40:08.330 --> 40:09.670
That's what
I'm pissed off about.

40:09.670 --> 40:11.800
[Shuga]
All of a sudden it's okay.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.770
She really just wants one wig,

40:13.770 --> 40:15.110
and it just so happens to be

40:15.110 --> 40:17.410
from the person
who is not in the workroom.

40:17.410 --> 40:18.410
Miss Ra'Jah.

40:18.410 --> 40:19.680
I did felt like, Ariel,

40:19.680 --> 40:21.280
you were a little more mad
about it yesterday

40:21.280 --> 40:22.520
-than you are right now.
-That's what I was going to say.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.780
Say what you mean, mama,
and mean what you say.

40:26.220 --> 40:28.450
[RuPaul] Okay.
[Queens] Ooh!

40:28.450 --> 40:30.560
I'm going to pretend
this is an episode

40:30.560 --> 40:32.430
of Murder, She Sat Down
and Wrote.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.830
[laughter]
Yes!

40:33.830 --> 40:34.960
And ask myself,

40:34.960 --> 40:37.900
"What would
Jessica Fletcher do?"

40:37.900 --> 40:39.670
Okay, no one's
leaving this room

40:39.670 --> 40:43.100
until we get to the bottom
of this mystery, okay?

40:43.100 --> 40:44.200
[Nina] My question,

40:44.200 --> 40:46.570
being that I was
still in the competition,

40:46.570 --> 40:50.040
is how did the wigs
get to Plastique's station

40:50.040 --> 40:52.350
if you didn't mean
to leave them for her?

40:52.350 --> 40:55.480
[Ariel] I moved all of my wigs
to a separate little section.

40:55.480 --> 40:56.880
When we are eliminated,

40:56.880 --> 40:58.350
we're going through
a lot of emotions.

40:58.350 --> 40:59.550
And when I was packing up,

40:59.550 --> 41:00.850
I was just kind of
in my feelings.

41:00.850 --> 41:02.120
I was really upset,

41:02.120 --> 41:03.590
and I forgot that
I moved stuff over there.

41:03.590 --> 41:06.290
I took several weeks
to unpack my bags,

41:06.290 --> 41:07.760
and then I realized,
oh, damn,

41:07.760 --> 41:08.760
I left a lot of wigs there.

41:08.760 --> 41:10.060
I was like oh, shit.

41:10.060 --> 41:12.000
I forgot to unpack
that entire shelf.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.770
I'm backpedaling.

41:13.770 --> 41:16.100
[RuPaul] Now Ariel, why did
you tell the girls

41:16.100 --> 41:18.000
that you left the wigs
by mistake

41:18.000 --> 41:22.240
when you tweeted that you
left them for Plastique.

41:22.240 --> 41:25.980
[gasps]
[murmurs]

41:25.980 --> 41:27.410
All right.

41:27.410 --> 41:29.720
I saw that Plastique
was under the impression

41:29.720 --> 41:31.180
that the wigs were for her.

41:31.180 --> 41:34.120
My ass knew that I left
them by mistake, okay?

41:34.120 --> 41:35.960
I totally left them
by mistake.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.620
And I'm going to tell you I did
not leave the wigs for you.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.430
Ha ha!

41:39.430 --> 41:41.290
Now, when I saw you guys
coming at her throat

41:41.290 --> 41:42.700
about this situation,

41:42.700 --> 41:44.800
I didn't want to dig her
into a bigger shithole

41:44.800 --> 41:45.930
than she was already in.

41:45.930 --> 41:47.800
Could you clarify
when did you not want

41:47.800 --> 41:49.500
to dig her into
a deeper shithole.

41:49.500 --> 41:50.900
Are you saying when
you came back,

41:50.900 --> 41:52.370
or when you was on Twitter?

41:52.370 --> 41:55.640
When I was home,
and I saw it happening--

41:55.640 --> 41:57.280
So you skipped
over when you was there.

41:57.280 --> 41:58.780
Okay, just clarifying.

41:58.780 --> 42:00.910
So when you did come back,
you were really upset about it.

42:00.910 --> 42:02.350
And that's the whole thing
that we were all like

42:02.350 --> 42:03.480
what the hell?

42:03.480 --> 42:04.780
Like, you were talking
all this shit

42:04.780 --> 42:06.290
and then when it
came down to it,

42:06.290 --> 42:07.890
you were like,
oh, I don't care.

42:07.890 --> 42:09.420
Like I said, again,
for the 19th time,

42:09.420 --> 42:11.160
I didn't want to dig her
into a bigger shithole

42:11.160 --> 42:12.830
when everybody else was
already ganging up on her.

42:12.830 --> 42:14.230
[Silky] But here's the thing.

42:14.230 --> 42:16.730
You was willing to turn on
all of us for your friend.

42:16.730 --> 42:18.000
[Ariel] This is my girl.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.530
You know I will always
defend her to the end,

42:19.530 --> 42:21.130
just as you would
defend A'Keria,

42:21.130 --> 42:22.300
A'Keria would defend you.

42:22.300 --> 42:23.840
We all spent a lot
of money to be here.

42:23.840 --> 42:25.540
I run my own hair business,
and you know--

42:25.540 --> 42:26.940
So when you were eliminated,

42:26.940 --> 42:29.310
we assumed that you wanted
to promote your business.

42:29.310 --> 42:31.910
And that's why we all
took a wig or two.

42:31.910 --> 42:35.080
[laughter]

42:35.080 --> 42:36.680
Girl, I told you
I left you one anyway.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.450
-I don't know why--
-No, we got that one.

42:38.450 --> 42:40.120
You saw the episode--

42:40.120 --> 42:42.720
I told you specifically
that I left you a wig.

42:42.720 --> 42:44.490
Ra'Jah. Hold on.
Hold on, everybody.

42:44.490 --> 42:46.530
-I left A'Keria--
-Please, wait.

42:46.530 --> 42:47.890
No, you didn't
leave A'Keria nothing.

42:47.890 --> 42:48.900
-She's grabbed it.
-Y'all, y'all, hold on.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.230
No, I left A'Keria a wig.

42:50.230 --> 42:53.600
Ra'Jah, did you
take a wig home?

42:53.600 --> 42:56.940
There was one of her wigs
that made it in my suitcase.

42:56.940 --> 42:59.170
[laughter]

43:01.740 --> 43:04.580
[Vanjie] She was dippin'
that shit. Shit had to go.

43:04.580 --> 43:08.180
[laughter]

43:10.350 --> 43:12.080
But bitch, guess what?

43:12.080 --> 43:13.690
-Oh.
-Oh, no way.

43:13.690 --> 43:14.920
Oh, no.

43:14.920 --> 43:18.020
But I did a couple of gigs
with it on, too.

43:18.020 --> 43:20.430
[cheers]

43:20.430 --> 43:22.230
-You threw a wig!
-Have at it.

43:22.230 --> 43:24.330
I can't believe--

43:24.330 --> 43:25.470
Can I have it?

43:25.470 --> 43:26.870
[RuPaul] Let's move on.

43:26.870 --> 43:28.570
My Jessica Fletcher
moment is ruined.

43:28.570 --> 43:30.140
[laughter]

43:30.140 --> 43:34.140
And I'm more confused about
the wigs than ever before.

43:34.140 --> 43:35.710
We'll be right back after this.

43:37.640 --> 43:40.310
Welcome back to
RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.

43:40.310 --> 43:42.520
I'm always so moved

43:42.520 --> 43:44.750
that the workroom
is a safe place

43:44.750 --> 43:47.650
for our girls to share
the most personal of topics.

43:47.650 --> 43:48.620
Take a look.

43:50.260 --> 43:51.490
I used to travel a lot.

43:51.490 --> 43:54.390
Why they put me
on a no-flight list?

43:54.390 --> 43:56.500
Like, girl, I couldn't fly.

43:56.500 --> 43:58.870
You're on the no-fly list?
Why?

43:58.870 --> 44:00.200
My name, and you know,

44:00.200 --> 44:02.070
especially what's
going on now these days.

44:02.070 --> 44:05.910
Oh, you mean some cute casual
societally built-in racism?

44:07.370 --> 44:09.040
I'm originally
from Mombasa, Kenya,

44:09.040 --> 44:11.510
and my name sound Muslim.

44:11.510 --> 44:14.250
So, they put me
on a watch list.

44:14.250 --> 44:16.980
And I was like,
I'm a drag queen.

44:16.980 --> 44:19.020
Like, what you
think I'm going to do?

44:19.020 --> 44:21.720
It's really hard,
especially in this country.

44:21.720 --> 44:25.390
I don't want people to feel like
every Muslim is a terrorist.

44:25.390 --> 44:27.590
Like, that's why I don't
really talk about it.

44:27.590 --> 44:29.660
I don't want
people to hate me.

44:29.660 --> 44:33.000
I've seen crazy stuff
on social media.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.570
Like the videos, I've seen it.

44:34.570 --> 44:38.540
People being hurt
because they're Muslim.

44:46.210 --> 44:49.080
It is a terrifying time
to be...

44:49.080 --> 44:51.380
-any sort of different...
-Anything different--

44:51.380 --> 44:53.390
-Yep.
-...in America right now.

44:53.390 --> 44:56.760
I realize that this
is an opportunity

44:56.760 --> 45:00.090
to share to the world,
I'm a proud Muslim.

45:00.090 --> 45:03.700
I'm the first drag
to be here

45:03.700 --> 45:05.100
that's Muslim.

45:07.270 --> 45:09.240
-Aww...
-We love you, Mercedes.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.300
Love you.

45:10.300 --> 45:12.040
[RuPaul] So, Mercedes,

45:12.040 --> 45:13.710
since you shared your story,

45:13.710 --> 45:15.610
what's the response been like?

45:15.610 --> 45:17.640
This is a dream
that came true.

45:17.640 --> 45:20.280
And I'm so grateful
for this opportunity.

45:20.280 --> 45:23.680
I've been getting so many
amazing messages, inboxes,

45:23.680 --> 45:25.320
people talking about, wow,

45:25.320 --> 45:27.650
thank you so much
for speaking for us,

45:27.650 --> 45:31.220
and being so brave,
and being you.

45:31.220 --> 45:33.260
And I'm just so grateful for it.

45:33.260 --> 45:35.730
And some of my family accept me.

45:40.200 --> 45:42.870
And, you know, some
of my family are like,

45:42.870 --> 45:45.170
"We don't understand."

45:45.170 --> 45:47.170
You know, and I get it.

45:47.170 --> 45:48.410
You know, it's hard.

45:48.410 --> 45:50.310
They're the old generation.

45:50.310 --> 45:51.780
Are they here in America?

45:51.780 --> 45:53.650
No, back home.

45:53.650 --> 45:55.510
Who's here for you in America?

45:55.510 --> 45:58.050
My two beautiful sisters.

45:58.050 --> 46:00.020
Um...

46:04.490 --> 46:06.960
We sit down one night
and I told them.

46:06.960 --> 46:09.730
And they were like,
you know what,

46:09.730 --> 46:11.660
are you happy?

46:11.660 --> 46:13.330
And I was like,
of course I'm happy.

46:13.330 --> 46:15.870
I've been doing this
for so long, I'm happy.

46:15.870 --> 46:17.870
And I'm living my dream.

46:17.870 --> 46:20.840
And I'm so close
to share my dream,

46:20.840 --> 46:23.140
my personal life,

46:23.140 --> 46:26.280
my religion,
and be proud of it and...

46:26.280 --> 46:27.510
to the world.

46:27.510 --> 46:30.450
And they were like,
if you're 100% happy,

46:30.450 --> 46:32.990
and you know you can do this,

46:32.990 --> 46:36.220
we'll support you 100%.

46:38.790 --> 46:41.030
This is a happy cry.
This is not like sad cry.

46:41.030 --> 46:43.700
[applause]

46:43.700 --> 46:45.630
And you should be happy, because
you are the most wonderful,

46:45.630 --> 46:47.430
lovely, sweet person.

46:47.430 --> 46:49.000
You really, really are.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.400
I'm so happy that you've had
a great experience with that.

46:51.400 --> 46:53.440
But what I really want to know

46:53.440 --> 46:55.210
is how many times a day

46:55.210 --> 46:57.510
do you come across people

46:57.510 --> 47:01.080
who scream "oppalent!"

47:01.080 --> 47:02.480
[laughter and applause]

47:02.480 --> 47:05.280
I earn everything.

47:05.280 --> 47:07.390
Oppalent...

47:07.390 --> 47:11.190
You earn everything.

47:11.190 --> 47:12.960
[laughter]

47:12.960 --> 47:14.260
I still have a hard time,

47:14.260 --> 47:16.030
you know, trying
to say the word.

47:16.030 --> 47:17.030
Let me hear you say it.

47:21.230 --> 47:23.770
Um...

47:23.770 --> 47:26.210
Opulent.

47:26.210 --> 47:27.310
Correct.

47:27.310 --> 47:31.480
You earn everyth--
You own everything.

47:31.480 --> 47:34.880
[laughter]

47:34.880 --> 47:37.280
Ooh, girl.

47:37.280 --> 47:39.020
You know, I just
wanted to ask Kahanna,

47:39.020 --> 47:40.720
do you feel left out

47:40.720 --> 47:43.990
of the whole
"oppalent" phenomenon?

47:43.990 --> 47:46.490
- You know, the thing
about it, in that moment,

47:46.490 --> 47:48.330
it was like really hard.

47:48.330 --> 47:51.030
So to see that,
like, play back

47:51.030 --> 47:52.260
and be such this
big thing is like,

47:52.260 --> 47:54.330
well, thank God I got
something out of it,

47:54.330 --> 47:56.140
because I was stressed
the fuck out doing it.

47:56.140 --> 47:57.440
-Yeah.
-So...

47:57.440 --> 48:00.070
I just kind of feel
like with Mercedes,

48:00.070 --> 48:03.240
like, we connected
the most on the show.

48:03.240 --> 48:05.710
And the thing that
like hurt the most

48:05.710 --> 48:09.550
was when you posted
our lip sync Work Bitch

48:09.550 --> 48:11.120
right before the show.

48:11.120 --> 48:13.590
And you said,
"Shantay you stay."

48:13.590 --> 48:16.490
And to me, that was just like,

48:16.490 --> 48:18.590
you just didn't care.

48:18.590 --> 48:21.560
You didn't really acknowledge,
like, my feelings in that.

48:21.560 --> 48:23.600
You know what I mean?

48:23.600 --> 48:25.260
-Can you explain that?
-Okay, hold on.

48:25.260 --> 48:27.770
Um, so I posted because
someone sent it to me.

48:27.770 --> 48:29.740
I was like, oh, girl,
this is cute one.

48:29.740 --> 48:31.170
And I just posted.

48:31.170 --> 48:33.810
And right away, that's when
I got the inbox from you.

48:33.810 --> 48:35.040
And what did I do?

48:35.040 --> 48:36.410
Before I even emailed her back,

48:36.410 --> 48:38.780
I went through my page,
took the video down,

48:38.780 --> 48:40.110
and I said, "I am so sorry."

48:40.110 --> 48:41.510
Kahanna, what hurt
your feelings about it?

48:41.510 --> 48:43.720
What was it?

48:43.720 --> 48:45.050
It was just the fact that
when she had posted that,

48:45.050 --> 48:47.120
it already--it took
away the surprise of

48:47.120 --> 48:49.090
"Oh, Kahanna might stay."

48:49.090 --> 48:50.360
-I did right away.
-You know what I mean?

48:50.360 --> 48:52.260
Because it wasn't like
it was there for days.

48:52.260 --> 48:53.960
And you--and insinuating

48:53.960 --> 48:55.260
that she had already
won the lip sync.

48:55.260 --> 48:57.660
Like I reached out to you,
and then like--

48:57.660 --> 48:59.330
And I did apologize to you.

48:59.330 --> 49:01.000
And I let it go
until you posted it again.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.500
And that's what bothered me.

49:02.500 --> 49:03.840
[oohs and laughter]

49:03.840 --> 49:05.910
And that's what bothered me.

49:05.910 --> 49:08.370
For me, you don't own
everything by being shady.

49:08.370 --> 49:10.240
And being shady
doesn't make you opulent.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.510
That's all I'm gonna say.

49:13.980 --> 49:15.350
[Brooke Lynn]
So she took it down,

49:15.350 --> 49:16.350
she posted it,
she took it down.

49:16.350 --> 49:18.250
And then when--
and then--

49:18.250 --> 49:19.620
and then she
reposted it later after

49:19.620 --> 49:21.690
-the lip sync had happened.
-Just listen now.

49:21.690 --> 49:23.260
So then,
so what is the matter?

49:23.260 --> 49:25.260
Why were you hurt by something

49:25.260 --> 49:28.590
you know her intention,
keyword, intention behind it

49:28.590 --> 49:29.830
wasn't to be hurtful.

49:29.830 --> 49:32.300
You know, you have to be
aware of your feelings.

49:32.300 --> 49:34.570
And because feelings
are not facts.

49:34.570 --> 49:36.940
What if I said, "You know what?
None of my business.

49:36.940 --> 49:38.640
What other people think of me

49:38.640 --> 49:40.340
is none of my business."
Let's all say it together.

49:40.340 --> 49:44.580
What other people think of me
is none of my business.

49:44.580 --> 49:46.050
Now remember that.
And the other thing,

49:46.050 --> 49:48.310
a word of advice:
Pay your taxes, please.

49:48.310 --> 49:49.320
[laughter]

49:49.320 --> 49:50.650
-Pay your taxes.
-Oh, girl.

49:50.650 --> 49:51.580
We will be right back.

49:54.090 --> 49:57.620
Welcome back to
RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.

49:57.620 --> 49:59.890
We are only one week away
from crowning

49:59.890 --> 50:02.800
America's next drag superstar.

50:02.800 --> 50:05.930
But first, it's time
to look back

50:05.930 --> 50:08.430
on the way we wore

50:08.430 --> 50:11.670
and play a little game
we call "Toot or Boot".

50:11.670 --> 50:13.040
Oh, God.

50:13.040 --> 50:15.110
Ladies, if you love
an outfit, toot it.

50:15.110 --> 50:17.540
And if you don't, boot it.

50:17.540 --> 50:19.080
-Oh, God.
-Okay?

50:19.080 --> 50:20.610
First up...

50:20.610 --> 50:23.880
Scarlet's Creature
from the Black Dragoon.

50:23.880 --> 50:25.180
-Toot.
-Toot.

50:25.180 --> 50:26.190
-I liked it.
-Toot?

50:26.190 --> 50:27.320
-Toot.
-Toot.

50:27.320 --> 50:29.090
Oh, that's a lot of toots.

50:29.090 --> 50:30.160
Honestly, it's just gas.

50:31.760 --> 50:34.230
I thought in the moment
most people were not liking it.

50:34.230 --> 50:35.590
As I remember,
when she turned around,

50:35.590 --> 50:37.460
she had that big hole
in the back, so you know.

50:39.730 --> 50:42.700
Up next, Plastique Tiara's
Farm to Runway.

50:42.700 --> 50:43.700
Toot or boot?

50:43.700 --> 50:44.840
-Toot.
-Toot.

50:44.840 --> 50:47.310
-Toot.
-[RuPaul] Toot? Yeah, yeah.

50:47.310 --> 50:49.640
-Did you toot it?
-Oh, absolutely.

50:49.640 --> 50:51.710
Baby, she looked like an angel.

50:51.710 --> 50:53.180
-Thank you.
-Gorgeous.

50:53.180 --> 50:54.750
No toot for Ra'Jah.

50:54.750 --> 50:57.280
No opinion.
No opinion.

50:58.620 --> 51:01.590
[RuPaul] Up next,
Nina West's Facekini.

51:01.590 --> 51:03.390
-Oh.
-Toot.

51:03.390 --> 51:04.460
-Toot.
-Shoot.

51:04.460 --> 51:05.490
All the way up.

51:05.490 --> 51:06.890
Honey, why did you like it?

51:06.890 --> 51:09.330
This is art.
This is Leigh Bowery.

51:09.330 --> 51:10.800
This is genius.

51:10.800 --> 51:14.070
Like, hands down by far is
the best thing that Nina, I--

51:14.070 --> 51:15.400
People come for you
for your runway,

51:15.400 --> 51:18.300
but if you do this,
it makes up for everything.

51:18.300 --> 51:19.570
Thank you?

51:21.110 --> 51:23.840
Up next, Shuga Cain's Troll.

51:23.840 --> 51:25.740
-Boot.
-Boot.

51:25.740 --> 51:27.080
-Boot.
-That's a heavy boot?

51:27.080 --> 51:29.250
Combat.

51:29.250 --> 51:31.880
Oh, Lord, we need to burn
this photo forever, girl.

51:33.250 --> 51:36.990
Up next, A'Keria's Caftan
That Wasn't.

51:36.990 --> 51:38.320
Toot or boot?

51:38.320 --> 51:39.660
-Boot.
-Boot.

51:39.660 --> 51:41.790
-Boot.
-Google caftan pants.

51:45.300 --> 51:49.070
Finally, Soju with
a Side of Kimchi.

51:49.070 --> 51:51.500
-Oh.
-Toot!

51:51.500 --> 51:52.670
Toot!

51:52.670 --> 51:54.640
-The hell out of here.

51:54.640 --> 51:57.980
A'Keria, why was that
not a toot for you?

51:57.980 --> 52:01.310
It was just so many knots.
It was confusing.

52:01.310 --> 52:02.720
Can I toot her
little spin-around

52:02.720 --> 52:04.880
-during the lip sync, at least?
-Yes.

52:04.880 --> 52:06.820
Listen, that's gonna
be my DragCon outfit,

52:06.820 --> 52:08.590
my finale outfit.

52:08.590 --> 52:10.120
I will take it everywhere.

52:11.720 --> 52:14.260
Now, as the Betsy DeVos
effect

52:14.260 --> 52:17.230
continues to decimate
the Department of Education,

52:17.230 --> 52:21.600
we here at RuPaul's Drag Race
are doing our part.

52:21.600 --> 52:24.670
In the great tradition
of Paris is Burning,

52:24.670 --> 52:27.210
the library is open, darling.

52:27.210 --> 52:28.370
Ooh!

52:28.370 --> 52:29.380
Because reading is what,
ladies?

52:29.380 --> 52:31.540
[All]
Fundamental!

52:31.540 --> 52:33.010
Okay.

52:33.010 --> 52:34.980
Now let's start with a queen
who didn't get a chance

52:34.980 --> 52:37.920
to read this season.
Kahanna.

52:37.920 --> 52:39.180
Who you gonna read, hon?

52:39.180 --> 52:40.820
I'm gonna start
with Miss Plastique.

52:40.820 --> 52:42.320
-Okay.
-Oh.

52:42.320 --> 52:44.120
I'm seeing you very clear
from here, darling.

52:44.120 --> 52:46.360
-And?
-It was interesting to me

52:46.360 --> 52:48.990
that you just learned about
Beyoncé four years ago,

52:48.990 --> 52:51.160
but you knew every word
to Hood Boy.

52:51.160 --> 52:54.770
Do they only know Missy Elliott
and Cardi B in Vietnam?

52:56.740 --> 52:58.470
Oh, she got you, girl.

53:00.670 --> 53:01.970
[RuPaul]
Mercedes?

53:01.970 --> 53:03.840
Okay, well, I'm gonna
start with you, Vanjie.

53:03.840 --> 53:05.240
You want me to read it
for you?

53:05.240 --> 53:08.910
Vanjie, right after Season 11,
you were just a meme.

53:08.910 --> 53:11.080
-And I guess--
-And what the fuck are you?

53:11.080 --> 53:13.190
--right after Season 11,
you're still a meme.

53:14.850 --> 53:17.220
Right, a meme that's still gonna
last longer than you, bitch.

53:19.660 --> 53:20.960
Whoever you bought
the jokes back,

53:20.960 --> 53:22.730
you better ask for
a refund, bitch.

53:22.730 --> 53:24.730
I did not buy these jokes, girl.

53:24.730 --> 53:26.430
I know you did.
$25 a joke.

53:26.430 --> 53:28.430
And you want your money back.
She need it back.

53:30.070 --> 53:31.840
Up next is Ariel.

53:31.840 --> 53:33.440
All right, I got a few.
Here we go.

53:33.440 --> 53:35.170
-Miss Yvie Oddly...
-Oh, shit.

53:35.170 --> 53:39.110
Babe, Frodo Baggins called.
Girl, he wants his ring back.

53:41.380 --> 53:43.180
Soju, Soju, girl,

53:43.180 --> 53:44.750
do you remember
that one episode when we--

53:44.750 --> 53:46.920
Oh, wait. You don't.

53:46.920 --> 53:48.150
Fuck you.

53:49.720 --> 53:51.890
Soju, who are you
going to read?

53:51.890 --> 53:53.890
Silky Nutmeg Ganache,

53:53.890 --> 53:57.160
I am so upset you used
a Sharpie on my face, girl.

53:57.160 --> 53:59.770
That's permanent,
unlike your career.

53:59.770 --> 54:01.630
Ooh!

54:01.630 --> 54:03.100
Girl, please.

54:03.100 --> 54:04.970
A'Keria, I'm scared of her,
so I can't do it.

54:07.510 --> 54:10.310
Ariel Versace,
you call me a blogger,

54:10.310 --> 54:11.880
you should read up on
my new article:

54:11.880 --> 54:14.450
"How to not fall in front
of RuPaul, bitch."

54:14.450 --> 54:15.510
Ooh!

54:16.920 --> 54:19.350
-Start wearing flats.
-Start wearing flats.

54:22.960 --> 54:24.260
[RuPaul]
Honey Davenport.

54:24.260 --> 54:27.790
A'Keria C. Davenport,
ass almighty.

54:27.790 --> 54:29.290
That ass is magical.

54:29.290 --> 54:31.360
It reminds me of a genie's lamp.

54:31.360 --> 54:33.500
Because it's cold, dark,

54:33.500 --> 54:35.400
and when men rub it,
they wish for something better.

54:38.300 --> 54:39.740
Nina's gonna read.

54:39.740 --> 54:42.140
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

54:42.140 --> 54:43.540
Come on, my bitch.

54:43.540 --> 54:45.380
You know, the only thing
less blended than your hip pads

54:45.380 --> 54:47.650
this season was the 'tique
you did on Soju's face.

54:49.780 --> 54:52.680
Speaking of Soju,
it's a shame that your career

54:52.680 --> 54:54.490
hasn't exploded
like your cyst.

54:55.950 --> 54:58.820
Tell me, really quick question.
Did it K-pop?

55:01.490 --> 55:02.660
[Silky]
No, you can't do that.

55:08.500 --> 55:10.340
Wow.

55:10.340 --> 55:11.970
All right.
Thank you, ladies.

55:11.970 --> 55:15.570
The library for Season 11
is closed officially.

55:15.570 --> 55:16.880
We'll be right back.

55:19.010 --> 55:22.010
Welcome back to
RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.

55:22.010 --> 55:24.420
Now, all season long,
they acted up,

55:24.420 --> 55:27.120
acted out and acted a fool.

55:27.120 --> 55:30.720
Now, I'm speaking about
our extra-special guest judges.

55:30.720 --> 55:34.030
Take a look at this
never-before-seen footage.

55:34.030 --> 55:36.330
You've all been pardoned.

55:38.100 --> 55:40.500
You're safe from elimination.

55:40.500 --> 55:41.870
Yeah!

55:41.870 --> 55:43.340
[laughter]

55:43.340 --> 55:44.670
Way to go!

55:44.670 --> 55:46.640
This is not a football game.

55:46.640 --> 55:48.240
[laughter]

55:48.240 --> 55:51.810
It's a competition where
people get eliminated, right?

55:51.810 --> 55:53.280
Just like football!

55:54.680 --> 55:56.220
Yeah!
Right, Ross?

55:56.220 --> 55:57.220
Yeah, bro.

55:57.220 --> 55:59.250
All right.

55:59.250 --> 56:01.350
What was the first record
you bought as a kid?

56:01.350 --> 56:02.850
Britney Spears.

56:02.850 --> 56:04.690
Which Britney album was it,
the first one?

56:04.690 --> 56:05.890
Yes.

56:05.890 --> 56:07.360
What's your favorite song
on that album?

56:07.360 --> 56:08.630
Um, one through 12.

56:10.600 --> 56:11.700
That's a good one.

56:11.700 --> 56:13.130
You're wearing ears
on your eyes.

56:13.130 --> 56:14.200
Nail-glued on.

56:14.200 --> 56:16.070
-Wood glue.
-Who?

56:16.070 --> 56:17.240
Wood glue.

56:17.240 --> 56:19.500
Wood glue? What the fuck
is wood glue?

56:19.500 --> 56:21.070
Like for tucking?

56:21.070 --> 56:23.840
[laughing]

56:23.840 --> 56:25.740
Everybody is wearing black,

56:25.740 --> 56:28.750
and, oh God, everybody
wears black all the time.

56:28.750 --> 56:30.320
It's so cliché.

56:33.690 --> 56:35.120
-Ru?
-Mm-hmm?

56:35.120 --> 56:36.460
Uh, have you considered doing

56:36.460 --> 56:38.690
a Fiddler on the Roof
drag challenge?

56:38.690 --> 56:40.360
Well, that's
a great idea, Natasha.

56:42.230 --> 56:43.230
Thanks.

56:45.660 --> 56:48.130
Can you turn around?
I just want to get a 360.

56:48.130 --> 56:49.470
The nuts in the crannies.

56:49.470 --> 56:50.770
Oh, yeah, there it is.

56:50.770 --> 56:53.710
I love that fact
that your ass is real,

56:53.710 --> 56:54.970
it's supple, it's tight.

56:54.970 --> 56:58.180
I miss real asses
being played up on camera.

56:58.180 --> 57:00.080
There's too much
injections going on

57:00.080 --> 57:01.210
when it comes to the ass.

57:01.210 --> 57:03.180
When we talk tits,
leave that alone,

57:03.180 --> 57:05.820
'cause this is like, you know,
my third boob job.

57:05.820 --> 57:07.790
I love that.

57:07.790 --> 57:09.720
I am weirdly intrigued by her.
I love her.

57:09.720 --> 57:12.460
And I love that hillbilly,
trucker laugh.

57:12.460 --> 57:14.760
Can you do an impression of it?

57:14.760 --> 57:16.260
[imitates trucker laugh]

57:16.260 --> 57:17.660
No.

57:17.660 --> 57:19.130
No, it's more...
[ imitates trucker laugh ]

57:19.130 --> 57:21.700
Sometimes she doesn't seem
like she's in this, like,

57:21.700 --> 57:23.500
woman-moment at all.

57:23.500 --> 57:26.370
She's just kind of like
hunched over there.

57:26.370 --> 57:28.070
By the way, same.

57:28.070 --> 57:29.040
Yeah.

57:30.610 --> 57:33.050
Michelle's upset about
how much I screamed.

57:33.050 --> 57:35.350
She hasn't heard that
much screaming since...

57:36.580 --> 57:38.350
-Last night?
-Yeah!

57:40.420 --> 57:42.150
[laughing]

57:42.150 --> 57:43.160
Oh, my God.

57:43.160 --> 57:45.960
Now, my top four queens:

57:45.960 --> 57:49.960
Ladies, each of you brings
your own distinct flavor

57:49.960 --> 57:52.800
of charisma, uniqueness,
nerve and talent

57:52.800 --> 57:55.530
and right now,
it's anyone's game,

57:55.530 --> 57:59.300
so tonight, let's end on
a kind note.

57:59.300 --> 58:03.180
My eliminated queens, I want
to hear something you love

58:03.180 --> 58:05.410
about each of the top four.

58:05.410 --> 58:09.080
Starting with...
A'Keria C. Davenport.

58:09.080 --> 58:13.450
I want to hear what you
have nice to say about A'Keria.

58:13.450 --> 58:14.820
She is the MacGyver of drag.

58:14.820 --> 58:18.160
She will take anything
and make something, so yeah.

58:18.160 --> 58:19.590
I don't know, I wanted
to say something nice

58:19.590 --> 58:21.230
just in case nobody
wouldn't say anything.

58:21.230 --> 58:23.430
Okay.

58:23.430 --> 58:26.370
Up next,
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

58:26.370 --> 58:28.170
Uh, as a fellow dancer...

58:28.170 --> 58:29.670
[laughter]

58:31.200 --> 58:32.740
I want to give you
credibility on

58:32.740 --> 58:34.170
specifically
your flexibility

58:34.170 --> 58:37.340
and how you move your body.

58:37.340 --> 58:39.850
Uh, it's something
I, you know, struggle with,

58:39.850 --> 58:42.180
and to see somebody
just take so naturally

58:42.180 --> 58:44.550
and live in their element...
you're beautiful to watch.

58:44.550 --> 58:45.820
Thank you so much.

58:45.820 --> 58:48.450
Up next, Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

58:48.450 --> 58:50.160
Oh, the hands are all up.

58:50.160 --> 58:52.120
All right, so Silky, you know,
throughout this whole process

58:52.120 --> 58:54.490
you and I obviously haven't been
Paris and Nicole.

58:54.490 --> 58:56.630
We're not the best of friends.

58:56.630 --> 58:57.960
We've had our beef.

58:57.960 --> 58:59.900
The thing is I always
will respect somebody

58:59.900 --> 59:03.270
that is 100%
authentically themselves,

59:03.270 --> 59:05.470
which you are, so I always
have to respect that.

59:05.470 --> 59:08.440
And props for you to doing you
the whole entire fucking time.

59:08.440 --> 59:09.610
Thank you.

59:09.610 --> 59:11.840
All right, up next:
Yvie Oddly.

59:11.840 --> 59:14.510
Um, I noticed Yvie.
The minute she walked in,

59:14.510 --> 59:16.820
I pegged her as
someone to watch,

59:16.820 --> 59:18.780
just because there was nobody
else like here in the room,

59:18.780 --> 59:20.350
and there was just something
about her that

59:20.350 --> 59:21.690
had this star quality.

59:21.690 --> 59:24.360
And I just think you are
so talented and so authentic

59:24.360 --> 59:26.260
and I love how you always
speak your mind,

59:26.260 --> 59:27.730
and I think it's
a really rare quality.

59:27.730 --> 59:29.060
And I think you're amazing.

59:29.060 --> 59:30.060
Thank you.

59:30.060 --> 59:31.160
Thanks, ladies.

59:31.160 --> 59:34.200
Now, in one week,
one of our top four

59:34.200 --> 59:36.740
will be crowned America's
next drag superstar,

59:36.740 --> 59:38.800
and win a one-year supply

59:38.800 --> 59:41.110
of Anastasia
Beverly Hills cosmetics

59:41.110 --> 59:46.210
and a cash prize of $100.000.

59:46.210 --> 59:49.750
One this very stage,
a spin of the wheel

59:49.750 --> 59:52.780
will kick off a series of events
that will end

59:52.780 --> 59:55.520
in an epic lip sync smackdown
for the crown,

59:55.520 --> 59:57.920
brought to you by Bai.

59:57.920 --> 1:00:00.090
Great flavor,
and good for you.

1:00:00.090 --> 1:00:01.930
A taste of both worlds.

1:00:03.400 --> 1:00:06.030
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

1:00:06.030 --> 1:00:08.470
Now, I need to hear from you.

1:00:08.470 --> 1:00:10.140
Who do you think should be

1:00:10.140 --> 1:00:11.970
America's next
drag superstar?

1:00:11.970 --> 1:00:14.310
Let your voice be heard.

1:00:14.310 --> 1:00:16.410
Are you Team A'Keria?

1:00:16.410 --> 1:00:17.910
Team Brooke Lynn?

1:00:17.910 --> 1:00:19.540
Team Silky?

1:00:19.540 --> 1:00:21.610
Or Team Yvie?

1:00:21.610 --> 1:00:23.110
And ladies, don't forget,

1:00:23.110 --> 1:00:27.050
one of you will also be taking
home the Golden Tweeterhead

1:00:27.050 --> 1:00:30.660
as season 11's
Miss Congeniality.

1:00:30.660 --> 1:00:33.390
All this and more will be
revealed in one week

1:00:33.390 --> 1:00:36.730
at the grand finale of
RuPaul's Drag Race.

1:00:36.730 --> 1:00:38.360
Now, if you can't
love yourself,

1:00:38.360 --> 1:00:41.100
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?

1:00:41.100 --> 1:00:42.570
Can I get an amen up in here?

1:00:42.570 --> 1:00:43.700
Amen!
