00:01.569 --> 00:03.768
DANIEL: Do you know what
I'd love to do now?

00:03.769 --> 00:05.688
You're drunk.

00:05.689 --> 00:10.928
But seriously, Danny, you know what
I love most about being out here?

00:10.929 --> 00:13.608
We can forget the rest of the world.

00:13.609 --> 00:15.928
All our problems.

00:15.929 --> 00:18.729
And that's what I love about you...

00:20.449 --> 00:22.129
...that you can do that.

00:24.929 --> 00:28.929
I'm sorry... for so many things.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.769
You both deserve a better life.

00:35.729 --> 00:39.488
Maybe we should move out of
Nethermoor before the baby comes.

00:39.489 --> 00:41.448
Make a fresh start.

00:41.449 --> 00:43.209
This is my home.

00:44.249 --> 00:46.249
This is our home.

01:00.449 --> 01:02.248
Danny, look.

01:02.249 --> 01:04.087
It's a shooting star.

01:04.089 --> 01:05.728
We should make a wish.

01:05.729 --> 01:07.768
I'm about to get mine.

01:07.769 --> 01:09.489
Stop it, Daniel.

01:11.769 --> 01:13.449
That's not a shooting star.

01:21.809 --> 01:23.409
Stay here!

01:34.529 --> 01:36.249
What is it?

01:45.929 --> 01:47.529
Danny!

01:48.569 --> 01:50.489
(SCREAMS) Danny!

01:51.529 --> 01:53.208
Rosie, run!

01:53.209 --> 01:54.889
Watch out!

01:57.009 --> 01:58.568
Danny! Danny, help!

01:58.569 --> 02:00.248
- Rosie, get up!
- Ah, Danny!

02:00.249 --> 02:02.088
- Rosie! Leave her alone!
- Danny!

02:02.089 --> 02:04.128
Rosie! Rosie!

02:04.129 --> 02:05.808
Get off her! Rosie!

02:05.809 --> 02:07.568
(SCREAMS)

02:07.569 --> 02:09.328
- Danny!
- Rosie!

02:09.329 --> 02:11.369
(SCREAMS) Danny!

02:21.289 --> 02:23.529
Come on. Come on, Lexie.

02:25.209 --> 02:27.888
Lexie. Get up. Go!

02:27.889 --> 02:29.929
(BARKS)

02:33.249 --> 02:35.249
(LEXIE CONTINUES BARKING)

02:38.569 --> 02:40.369
What the devil?

02:45.089 --> 02:46.809
Are you all right?

02:51.729 --> 02:53.729
Rosie...

02:54.769 --> 02:56.769
Where's Rosie?

03:00.929 --> 03:02.929
Rosie!

03:05.769 --> 03:08.249
Rosie! Rosie!

03:14.729 --> 03:16.729
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

03:19.130 --> 03:21.778
Hey, I got a guy looking into
Penelope Graves.

03:21.780 --> 03:23.152
Course you have.

03:23.153 --> 03:24.471
Give me that.

03:24.473 --> 03:27.208
You're so intrigued with
this stupid Martian sighting

03:27.209 --> 03:29.568
you'll take a six-hour train ride
to check it out.

03:29.569 --> 03:32.048
You'll make the same
journey to prove me wrong.

03:32.049 --> 03:35.728
But you find... you find out that
Adelaide is using an alias,

03:35.729 --> 03:37.992
lying to us and the rest of the world,

03:37.994 --> 03:39.205
and you act like you
couldn't care less.

03:39.207 --> 03:40.684
What you imagine to be indifference

03:40.684 --> 03:44.284
is actually respect for
Constable Stratton's privacy.

03:49.449 --> 03:52.528
She marries a successful businessman,
two years later he's dead,

03:52.529 --> 03:55.688
she's changed her name, working
as a cop. It's some sort of scandal.

03:55.689 --> 03:58.128
I don't know if it's
financial, criminal or sexual.

03:58.129 --> 04:00.488
No prizes for guessing
which you're hoping for.

04:00.489 --> 04:02.651
Is there a prize for guessing
why you're afraid to know?

04:02.653 --> 04:03.967
I'm sure she'll confide in us

04:03.969 --> 04:06.568
if and when we've earned her trust.

04:06.569 --> 04:09.409
If she doesn't trust us by now,
should we be trusting her?

04:13.809 --> 04:15.609
We should be in Nethermoor shortly.

04:19.409 --> 04:21.408
Have I interrupted something?

04:21.409 --> 04:23.208
We were discussing the cricket.

04:23.209 --> 04:26.008
I didn't know you were a fan.
It was a one-sided discussion.

04:26.009 --> 04:28.768
- Looking for something?
- Yes. The key to my satchel.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.528
I seem to have misplaced it.

04:30.529 --> 04:32.169
Penny?

04:36.209 --> 04:38.209
For the lock.
It's a pretty simple lock.

04:40.089 --> 04:42.089
More of a clasp, really.

04:43.329 --> 04:46.128
I need to learn that trick.
Happy to share.

04:46.129 --> 04:48.169
No secrets between friends, right?

04:55.009 --> 04:57.728
Why should we be out there
searching? He knows where she is.

04:57.729 --> 04:59.688
It's nothing a good
hiding won't reveal.

04:59.689 --> 05:02.368
You're searching because I'm
the only copper you've got.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.728
I can't cover 1100 acres all by myself.

05:04.729 --> 05:06.328
- I can't cover 1100 acres all by.
- Rubbish.

05:06.329 --> 05:08.168
Him and his kind, they're all t'same.

05:08.169 --> 05:10.808
If I had my way, he'd have
been hung, drawn and quartered

05:10.809 --> 05:12.448
the minute he got back here,

05:12.449 --> 05:14.888
with all that nonsense about
monsters from the sky.

05:14.889 --> 05:16.568
He's killed our Rosie!

05:16.569 --> 05:18.929
Constable Booth?
Hope we're interrupting.

05:20.038 --> 05:21.332
Who are you?

05:21.334 --> 05:23.433
I'm Harry Houdini.
Pleasure to meet you.

05:26.009 --> 05:27.608
These are my friends,

05:27.609 --> 05:30.288
Dr Arthur Conan Doyle and
Constable Adelaide Stratton.

05:30.289 --> 05:33.008
They've come from London to help us
get to the bottom of it.

05:33.009 --> 05:35.489
This is Jim Gorton, the
uncle of the missing woman.

05:36.689 --> 05:39.008
They have lady coppers
in London now, do they?

05:39.009 --> 05:41.089
(RIPPLES OF LAUGHTER) Fortunately, yes.

05:42.129 --> 05:44.328
This must be a very
difficult time for you,

05:44.329 --> 05:47.728
but I assure you we're going to do
everything we can to find your niece.

05:47.729 --> 05:50.488
You've brung in outsiders, some woman,

05:50.489 --> 05:52.608
doesn't know Rosie, doesn't care -

05:52.609 --> 05:54.968
- I assure you I care.
- This isn't your problem.

05:54.969 --> 05:57.009
- I assure you I care.
- Jim, don't make this worse.

05:58.809 --> 06:00.528
Hey, Jim.

06:00.529 --> 06:02.569
I'm guessing you like to drink.

06:03.849 --> 06:05.849
Pint's on me.

06:12.089 --> 06:14.489
Don't need handouts from you, Yank.

06:16.689 --> 06:19.968
Booth, you've got a decision to
make. Whose side you're on.

06:19.969 --> 06:21.609
This town...

06:22.649 --> 06:25.369
...or are you with that
black bastard you're hiding, eh?

06:38.209 --> 06:39.809
Welcome to Nethermoor (!)

06:43.969 --> 06:47.128
When Inspector Merring said he was
sending his three leading experts

06:47.129 --> 06:50.368
in the supernatural field, I didn't
realise he meant either of you.

06:50.369 --> 06:52.768
Is everybody like Jim,
or do you have any humans (?)

06:52.769 --> 06:55.128
He's a hothead, but he's
upset about his niece.

06:55.129 --> 06:59.008
And I have to admit, Daniel's tale
is pretty far-fetched.

06:59.009 --> 07:00.719
And that's enough to
keep him locked up?

07:00.721 --> 07:01.663
Yeah.

07:01.665 --> 07:04.129
If I let him out, he's a dead man.

07:06.409 --> 07:08.129
Daniel?

07:09.929 --> 07:13.008
They were small, spindly things.

07:13.009 --> 07:15.049
Skin you could almost see through.

07:16.209 --> 07:18.009
Black eyes.

07:19.169 --> 07:21.168
Hell of a story.

07:21.169 --> 07:23.288
Indeed.

07:23.289 --> 07:25.129
Would you mind?

07:26.169 --> 07:28.328
He's a doctor.

07:28.329 --> 07:30.129
And the spaceship?

07:32.369 --> 07:34.409
You don't believe me.

07:35.729 --> 07:37.368
All sorts of people saw it.

07:37.369 --> 07:41.208
A few people saw strange lights.
No-one saw a spaceship.

07:41.209 --> 07:43.809
Why do you think they take
Rosie and left you behind?

07:44.849 --> 07:46.729
I'd like to see you fight them off.

07:47.769 --> 07:50.008
Daniel, is there anything
else you can tell us?

07:50.009 --> 07:52.808
The smallest detail that can
help corroborate your story?

07:52.809 --> 07:56.729
I've tried, I've tried,
but there's holes.

07:58.209 --> 07:59.809
Pieces missing.

08:01.249 --> 08:03.648
Please, you've got to believe me.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.768
You've got get me out of here.

08:05.769 --> 08:08.489
Help me find my Rosie
before the baby comes.

08:10.129 --> 08:12.288
One thing's for certain.

08:12.289 --> 08:14.249
He's lying.

08:15.289 --> 08:17.088
What?

08:17.089 --> 08:19.648
Why don't you believe him?
Because he's black?

08:19.649 --> 08:22.048
I don't believe him because
he's an alcoholic.

08:22.049 --> 08:24.368
He has Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome.

08:24.369 --> 08:27.768
An encephalopathy
associated with alcoholism.

08:27.769 --> 08:31.248
He's been in a cell for the last
two days with no access to alcohol.

08:31.249 --> 08:34.488
- It's a chronic condition. He has
all the symptoms: droopy eyelids,

08:34.489 --> 08:39.768
elevated pulse, ataxia,
nystagmus, rocking back and forth

08:39.769 --> 08:43.769
and most significantly of all,
he's prone to confabulations.

08:44.809 --> 08:46.129
He lies.

08:46.131 --> 08:48.008
All of those symptoms,
except for the last one,

08:48.009 --> 08:51.448
are consistent with a man whose wife
was attacked before his eyes.

08:51.449 --> 08:54.248
- And the cuts on his arm -
- Are perfectly consistent with a man

08:54.249 --> 08:56.608
who attacked his wife
while she fought back.

08:56.609 --> 08:58.848
You think he killed his pregnant wife?

08:58.849 --> 09:00.688
And then what?

09:00.689 --> 09:03.208
- He buried her body?
- Or she just ran away.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.288
Why make up a story no-one is going
to believe?

09:05.289 --> 09:08.208
It's perfectly possible he doesn't
remember anything at all.

09:08.209 --> 09:11.808
His mind fills in the gaps
with this farcical story.

09:11.809 --> 09:13.569
I believe him.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.608
You believe in Martians?

09:16.609 --> 09:18.808
There's plenty of good
science to back it up.

09:18.809 --> 09:22.208
We know there are canals on Mars.
Where there's water, there's life.

09:22.209 --> 09:25.168
Not an hour ago, on the train, you
were mocking my credulity.

09:25.169 --> 09:28.648
I was unconvinced. Now, I've seen
the eyewitness and he convinced me.

09:28.649 --> 09:30.568
You're being deliberately contrary.

09:30.569 --> 09:33.648
You can see I'm not buying his
story, so you're pretending you do.

09:33.649 --> 09:35.288
But a woman is missing.

09:35.289 --> 09:38.088
God knows what's happened to her.
This is no joking matter.

09:38.089 --> 09:41.608
Who's joking? We find these
creatures, we find Rosie.

09:41.609 --> 09:43.449
How exactly do you plan to do that?

09:47.169 --> 09:48.808
Now what do you see?

09:48.809 --> 09:52.609
The light, glowing, over the hill.

09:55.049 --> 09:56.928
What do you hear?

09:56.929 --> 09:58.929
Just my footfalls.

10:00.249 --> 10:02.048
(SNIFFS)

10:02.049 --> 10:04.169
I smell flowers.

10:05.289 --> 10:07.009
Roses?

10:08.049 --> 10:09.968
Lords and ladies.

10:09.969 --> 10:12.248
(That wasn't in the report.)

10:12.249 --> 10:16.128
When you come over the top of
the hill, what do you see?

10:16.129 --> 10:20.889
Something burning, but not on fire.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.289
Glowing, like an ember.

10:26.329 --> 10:28.768
Rosie. Rosie!

10:28.769 --> 10:31.688
You're perfectly safe, Daniel.
What's happening to Rosie?

10:31.689 --> 10:34.048
She's fallen. They're all over her.

10:34.049 --> 10:38.569
One of them's grabbing me. There's
something around its neck.

10:40.009 --> 10:41.688
A medallion?

10:41.689 --> 10:44.089
A strange shape on it.
Can you draw it for me?

10:53.929 --> 10:55.768
People don't lie under hypnosis.

10:55.769 --> 10:57.728
Unless they've already formed a memory,

10:57.729 --> 11:00.489
an altered reality within
their conscious mind.

11:02.009 --> 11:04.009
This alone was worth the trip.

11:06.049 --> 11:07.729
(CLICKS HIS FINGERS)

11:08.809 --> 11:10.809
Is that it?

11:20.049 --> 11:21.648
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

11:21.649 --> 11:25.648
Someone obviously forgot to tell the
welcoming committee we were coming.

11:25.649 --> 11:27.079
Daniel and Rosie were here

11:27.079 --> 11:29.887
when he claims to have seen
the mysterious object in the sky.

11:29.889 --> 11:31.483
But Daniel was found here.

11:31.483 --> 11:34.887
The search party checked everywhere
in between but didn't find anything.

11:34.889 --> 11:37.248
Finding nothing doesn't mean
there's nothing to be found.

11:37.249 --> 11:38.848
- That doesn't mean there's nothing to.
- Apparently some sheep were stolen.

11:38.849 --> 11:40.928
Think the Martians
abducted them too (?)

11:40.929 --> 11:44.008
Do they communicate telepathically
or do they speak Martianese?

11:44.009 --> 11:46.048
(LAUGHS)

11:46.049 --> 11:47.888
(COUGHS)

11:47.889 --> 11:50.168
I'm sorry. So sorry.

11:50.169 --> 11:52.528
- This isn't tea.
- It's saloop.

11:52.529 --> 11:54.968
A popular drink round these parts.

11:54.969 --> 11:57.009
Not for t'London palate, though.

11:58.089 --> 11:59.768
They're not necessarily Martians.

11:59.769 --> 12:02.128
There are seven other
planets in the universe.

12:02.129 --> 12:04.488
So, what do you propose we call
them?I dunno.

12:04.489 --> 12:08.088
Aliens? Isn't that the name you give
to anyone who's different?

12:08.089 --> 12:11.048
It is hard to reconcile that you
really believe in all this.

12:11.049 --> 12:12.689
Why don't you?

12:13.729 --> 12:17.528
Because I think man is the ultimate
expression of God's creation.

12:17.529 --> 12:20.368
And I'm including women in that.
I agree with the women part,

12:20.369 --> 12:23.568
but that doesn't preclude the
possibility of life on other planets.

12:23.569 --> 12:28.008
The only aliens Daniel saw are ones
he created in his intoxicated state.

12:28.009 --> 12:30.848
Why are you so determined on
giving him a drinking problem?

12:30.849 --> 12:34.848
Daniel Berry likes his drink.
No-one knows better than me.

12:34.849 --> 12:38.088
Got a nasty temper on him an' ll.
I bet he's shiftless and lazy too.

12:38.089 --> 12:40.368
Now that you mention it - - Saloop.

12:40.369 --> 12:43.208
It's made from the roots
of orchids, isn't it?

12:43.209 --> 12:46.048
Made this batch with the last lot
of cuckoopint I could find.

12:46.049 --> 12:47.848
Picked the flowers a few days ago.

12:47.849 --> 12:50.368
Cuckoopint, also known
as lords and ladies.

12:50.369 --> 12:53.729
Daniel recalled the scent under
hypnosis. Can you tell me where?

12:54.769 --> 12:57.768
The flowers should be
somewhere near here.

12:57.769 --> 13:00.248
Nice to see you out of uniform.

13:00.249 --> 13:02.328
That colour suits you.

13:02.329 --> 13:03.968
Thank you.

13:03.969 --> 13:06.809
I never believed a woman in
mourning had to wear black.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.849
It's been nearly two years.

13:11.969 --> 13:13.569
Was it sudden?

13:14.809 --> 13:16.969
Very. Heart attack.

13:19.409 --> 13:21.168
I'm sorry.

13:21.169 --> 13:22.848
It must be very difficult.

13:22.849 --> 13:24.888
Single woman...

13:24.889 --> 13:28.608
Does Scotland Yard pay your
expenses while you're up here?

13:28.609 --> 13:31.088
Scotland Yard doesn't pay for much.

13:31.089 --> 13:34.329
Luckily, I didn't become a
police officer for the money.

13:40.169 --> 13:42.648
Winning her trust? Au contraire.

13:42.649 --> 13:45.648
She just told me that her
husband died of a heart attack.

13:45.649 --> 13:48.648
- But she was lying.
- How on earth can you know that?

13:48.649 --> 13:51.608
Her breathing changed,
she tensed slightly.

13:51.609 --> 13:53.808
I used to be a pretty good cold reader.

13:53.809 --> 13:56.328
So, you've ruled out heart attack.

13:56.329 --> 13:58.448
I've ruled out a lot more than that.

13:58.449 --> 14:01.848
She's not just going to substitute one
mundane cause of death for another.

14:01.849 --> 14:04.648
Which means it wasn't natural causes?

14:04.649 --> 14:06.648
And as to the nature of the scandal,

14:06.649 --> 14:10.728
I've ruled out financial, which
leaves criminal and hmm-hmm-hmm.

14:10.729 --> 14:12.408
Over here!

14:12.409 --> 14:14.449
(WHISTLES)

14:19.249 --> 14:20.848
Ah!

14:20.849 --> 14:23.129
Lords and ladies.

14:24.249 --> 14:25.928
According to Daniel's statement,

14:25.929 --> 14:28.129
the landing site was
at the foot of a hill.

14:56.649 --> 14:59.688
Notice the size and shape of the area?

14:59.689 --> 15:03.408
Looks like the landing site of some
kind of alien craft to me.

15:03.409 --> 15:05.088
(CHUCKLES)

15:05.089 --> 15:06.928
Here's your 'alien craft'.

15:06.929 --> 15:08.649
It's a meteorite.

15:10.809 --> 15:12.449
That caused this?

15:13.689 --> 15:15.288
And the lights?

15:15.289 --> 15:18.488
It would've been much bigger as it
streaked through the atmosphere,

15:18.489 --> 15:20.249
burning like a torch.

15:23.249 --> 15:25.248
The circle is the impact site.

15:25.249 --> 15:26.888
Spectacular.

15:26.889 --> 15:28.609
But all perfectly natural.

15:30.729 --> 15:32.729
Look at this.

15:54.689 --> 15:56.408
That's it.

15:56.409 --> 15:58.248
That's what I saw.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.529
Have you found Rosie?

16:01.729 --> 16:03.528
We'll keep looking.

16:03.529 --> 16:07.008
- You believe me now though, right?
- This medallion's made of lead.

16:07.009 --> 16:09.408
Hardly evidence of an other-worldly
origin.

16:09.409 --> 16:11.568
If there's water elsewhere
in the universe,

16:11.569 --> 16:13.488
isn't it possible there's lead too?

16:13.489 --> 16:15.368
I'm being logical.

16:15.369 --> 16:17.088
- You have to let me go!
- I can't.

16:17.089 --> 16:18.728
I have to find Rosie!

16:18.729 --> 16:20.769
- You're not going anywhere.
- Let me out!

16:23.369 --> 16:26.088
The innkeeper told us
Daniel has a temper on him.

16:26.089 --> 16:28.168
He's locked up while
his wife is missing!

16:28.169 --> 16:29.848
The innkeeper's right.

16:29.849 --> 16:32.768
Daniel has had one or two run-ins,
after he's had a snoutful.

16:32.769 --> 16:34.648
I'm guessing everyone in this town has.

16:34.649 --> 16:37.488
You think this one's guilty because
of the colour of his skin.

16:37.489 --> 16:39.648
You think he's innocent
for the same reason.

16:39.649 --> 16:43.048
When a woman goes missing, it's
reasonable to consider the husband.

16:43.049 --> 16:46.888
The bigger issue is, seems we were
searching in the wrong place

16:46.889 --> 16:50.048
and unfortunately, it's getting a
bit late for a search party.

16:50.049 --> 16:52.529
It's probably best to
leave it till morning.

16:53.769 --> 16:55.808
If you're right, we're
looking for a body.

16:55.809 --> 16:57.648
We don't want to miss any clues.

16:57.649 --> 17:01.329
And if you're right, she may well
be several million miles from here.

17:05.689 --> 17:07.289
Martha Stiles.

17:08.969 --> 17:13.008
She reported seeing something on the
morning after Rosie's disappearance,

17:13.009 --> 17:15.048
a 'strange creature'.

17:15.049 --> 17:17.088
A lovely lady, lives
on the edge of town,

17:17.089 --> 17:19.848
but there's a reason why
everyone calls her Mad Martha.

17:30.289 --> 17:33.489
- Martha, we wanted to ask you about -
- Where are you from?

17:36.849 --> 17:39.528
(CLEARS THROAT) US of A, ma'am.

17:39.529 --> 17:43.368
We believe you had a sighting the
morning after -

17:43.369 --> 17:46.089
- You want to ask about the kobolds.

17:47.489 --> 17:50.328
Originally, your people
where are they from?

17:50.329 --> 17:52.369
You have a different colouring.

17:53.609 --> 17:56.968
I was born in Budapest, but we moved
to America when I was four.

17:56.969 --> 17:59.248
Did you say 'kobolds'?

17:59.249 --> 18:01.569
Goblins, sprites.

18:03.129 --> 18:04.888
Houdini?

18:04.889 --> 18:07.009
What kind of a name is that?

18:08.049 --> 18:10.569
A stage name. I was born Erich Weiss.

18:11.969 --> 18:13.969
A Jew.

18:15.689 --> 18:17.689
You must try my knedle.

18:19.929 --> 18:21.528
You make knedle?

18:21.529 --> 18:23.969
- What's knedlay?
- Knedle.

18:31.289 --> 18:33.088
Perfect.

18:33.089 --> 18:35.488
My family are Slavs.

18:35.489 --> 18:38.848
My name is actually Marta, not Martha.

18:38.849 --> 18:41.968
The English have a way of
diluting your culture.

18:41.969 --> 18:44.969
(CHUCKLES)- Can you describe
the 'kobolds' for us?

18:47.729 --> 18:50.528
Your family escaped the pogrom too?

18:50.529 --> 18:52.888
My family came here from Russia.

18:52.889 --> 18:55.448
I was four, just like you.

18:55.449 --> 18:58.688
- It's a hell of a place to come.
- This was a rich mining town.

18:58.689 --> 19:01.568
A magnet for people
from all over Europe

19:01.569 --> 19:03.928
looking for jobs and a fresh start.

19:03.929 --> 19:07.168
The kobolds, are they tall? Short?
Furry?

19:07.169 --> 19:10.008
But we faced a pogrom here too.

19:10.009 --> 19:14.408
When the mines closed, the
villagers drove everyone out.

19:14.409 --> 19:16.688
When the mines closed, There
was a lot of violence.

19:16.689 --> 19:19.609
People were killed - stoned to death.

19:21.169 --> 19:23.409
It was like Russia again.

19:25.209 --> 19:26.808
You survived.

19:26.809 --> 19:28.568
Somehow.

19:28.569 --> 19:32.449
I'm sure you're not a
stranger to prejudice.

19:37.289 --> 19:40.889
Mrs Stiles, what exactly
do the kobolds look like?

19:42.409 --> 19:46.288
Gentle little creatures
with the fairest skin.

19:46.289 --> 19:48.569
Pendants round their neck.

19:50.569 --> 19:52.208
They steal things.

19:52.209 --> 19:55.128
Clothes from the washing line.

19:55.129 --> 19:57.848
Food from the pantry.

19:57.849 --> 20:02.848
But they always leave a
little gift in return.

20:02.849 --> 20:07.248
My mother used to say it
was good luck to see one.

20:07.249 --> 20:10.529
I've got everything written down here.

20:11.889 --> 20:15.088
Just because she's seen them more
than once doesn't mean she's crazy.

20:15.089 --> 20:17.030
It could mean that
they've been here before.

20:17.032 --> 20:18.928
Ah! So, you believe
in goblins now too?

20:18.929 --> 20:22.648
I'm suggesting goblins are her way of
interpreting visitors from outer space.

20:22.649 --> 20:25.727
Why would they keep coming back to
Nethermoor? For the hospitality (?)

20:25.758 --> 20:27.413
Here he is reaching leg.
Maybe you're right.

20:27.415 --> 20:28.829
Maybe they don't have
lead on their planet

20:28.845 --> 20:29.897
and they've come here to mine it.

20:29.899 --> 20:31.488
There's nothing like a lead spacecraft.

20:31.489 --> 20:33.386
Aliens have been coming here
for thousands of years,

20:33.386 --> 20:34.573
according to the Bible.

20:34.575 --> 20:36.369
That would be The Book of Venusians?

20:36.371 --> 20:39.128
Ezekiel. - Mm. Those were angels.

20:39.129 --> 20:41.488
You call them angels. Martha calls
them kobolds.

20:41.489 --> 20:44.809
HG Wells called them Martians.
What if they're all the same thing?

20:45.569 --> 20:48.129
- Oh. We need three rooms.
- I've only got two.

20:49.009 --> 20:51.609
- Looks like we'll just have to share.
- No.

20:53.409 --> 20:56.448
I want to know why you're
protecting that bloody darkie.

It's bad enough he's got
Booth pandering to him

20:58.849 --> 21:01.688

here, giving us what's what.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER BECOMES HUSHED)

21:06.169 --> 21:08.208

You telling me to leave?

21:10.689 --> 21:13.448
Go on, Jimmy! Give it to him!

Gifts from the kobolds.

22:35.129 --> 22:38.888
Lots of them, all faithfully
recorded by Mad Martha.

22:38.889 --> 22:41.648
Oh, look, here's a message from them.

22:41.649 --> 22:43.769
Oh, my mistake.

22:44.809 --> 22:47.328
It's a recipe for knedle
in Latvian or something.

22:47.329 --> 22:50.849
Maybe that's why they're occupying
Earth, for our plum dumplings (!)

22:53.369 --> 22:56.648
Clearly, only a brainless bigot
can get a rise out of you.

22:56.649 --> 22:58.768
I'm doing my exercises, all right?

22:58.769 --> 23:01.968
Something you might want to think
about at some point in your life.

23:01.969 --> 23:05.009
I won Man of the Match at Lords,
Saturday last, thank you.

23:11.849 --> 23:14.048
Look, it's pretty clear
what's going on.

23:14.049 --> 23:16.248
It must have been tough
for you and your family

23:16.249 --> 23:19.328
having to deal with other people's
blind spots and prejudices.

23:19.329 --> 23:21.688
What people call me is
their problem, not mine.

23:21.689 --> 23:24.408
The only person who can put
you in the gutter is you.

23:24.409 --> 23:27.328
The point is, I
understand how you feel.

23:27.329 --> 23:29.409
I don't think you do, Doctor Doyle.

23:30.529 --> 23:32.729
I've experienced bigotry.

23:34.369 --> 23:36.528
When I was 12, we had a black maid.

23:36.529 --> 23:38.528
Wonderful woman. Ina.

23:38.529 --> 23:41.168
One summer, my cousin
came for a fortnight.

23:41.169 --> 23:43.008
He had an amazing pocket watch.

23:43.009 --> 23:45.448
It was handed down from our
great-grandfather.

23:45.449 --> 23:47.128
I couldn't resist it.

23:47.129 --> 23:49.169
I stole it.

23:50.529 --> 23:53.568
My father assumed it
was Ina and I let him.

23:53.569 --> 23:55.608
He sacked her

23:55.609 --> 23:59.129
and I'll never forget the look
she gave me when she left.

24:00.249 --> 24:04.169
Not anger, just disappointment.

24:08.409 --> 24:10.408
That's it?

24:10.409 --> 24:13.448
Your experience of bigotry
is that you were a bigot?

24:13.449 --> 24:16.568
That I learned a valuable
lesson about bigotry.

24:16.569 --> 24:19.849
You learned that it was bad.
What a revelation (!)

24:24.969 --> 24:26.888
Please don't tell me that's silk.

24:26.889 --> 24:29.048
Says the man in the flannel nightshirt.

24:29.049 --> 24:32.168
Don't you have a hat to match?
You know, with a little tassel?

24:32.169 --> 24:34.009
Here, take a look at this.

24:37.729 --> 24:39.928
Benjamin Graves, Adelaide's husband.

24:39.929 --> 24:42.568
You stole this from her?I
understand photos of her husband.

24:42.569 --> 24:44.481
Why all the pictures
of Nigel Pennington?

24:44.483 --> 24:45.842
He was a friend of her husband's.

24:45.844 --> 24:49.248
You remember the telegram we found at
Adelaide's house from Pennington?

24:49.249 --> 24:52.488
It said 'You were wrong about me?'
I think they were having an affair.

24:52.489 --> 24:55.289
And Pennington killed her husband to
get him out of the way.

24:56.809 --> 24:59.048
- That's George Ives.
- Who's George Ives?

24:59.049 --> 25:01.968
He's a founding member of
the Order of Chaeronea.

25:01.969 --> 25:06.528
It's a not-so secret society for
gentlemen with a certain preference.

25:06.529 --> 25:09.128
Let's just say he invited
Oscar Wilde to join.

25:09.129 --> 25:13.129
So maybe it wasn't Adelaide who was
having the affair with Pennington.

25:17.129 --> 25:19.848
Maybe Pennington killed him
over a lover's quarrel.

25:19.849 --> 25:22.208
Or maybe Graves was
threatening to expose him.

25:22.209 --> 25:24.849
Or maybe Graves was threatening to
Either way, it'd be a scandal.

25:25.129 --> 25:26.729
A sexual one.

25:28.489 --> 25:30.328
That's why she changed her name.

25:30.329 --> 25:32.368
Must have been devastating for her.

25:32.369 --> 25:35.209
Just the thought of two
men sleeping together...

25:36.889 --> 25:39.329
Shove over, Man of the Match.

25:45.969 --> 25:47.569
Ah-ah-ah!

25:48.969 --> 25:50.969
You wanna take that outside?

26:18.329 --> 26:20.329
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

26:25.249 --> 26:27.569
I saw your light on. Are you all right?

26:29.449 --> 26:31.608
I couldn't sleep.

26:31.609 --> 26:33.649
How's Houdini?

26:35.169 --> 26:38.248
I think this is turning out to be a
very personal case for him.

26:38.249 --> 26:40.609
I'm sure that's true.

26:42.489 --> 26:45.288
But he's been acting odd ever
since the train journey.

26:45.289 --> 26:47.329
You wouldn't happen to know why?

26:53.209 --> 26:56.488
I just hope you'd ask me if there
was something you wanted to know.

26:56.489 --> 26:58.809
Absolutely.

27:00.169 --> 27:02.169
Good night.

28:10.930 --> 28:12.929
Hey.

28:12.930 --> 28:15.249
Where's Doyle?

28:15.250 --> 28:17.729
Wasn't he your bedfellow last night?

28:17.730 --> 28:19.370
Not when I woke up.

28:20.730 --> 28:22.730
I'm sure he's just gone for a walk.

28:24.330 --> 28:26.209
How's your eye?

28:26.210 --> 28:28.090
It's fine.

28:29.050 --> 28:31.530
(SIGHS)

28:32.850 --> 28:34.850
I'm sorry about last night.

28:35.970 --> 28:38.530
The whole thing kinda got away from me.

28:40.050 --> 28:42.090
Believe it or not, I understand.

28:43.650 --> 28:45.530
I believe it.

28:51.770 --> 28:55.089
You know, the first time I
ever had cuffs put on me,

28:55.090 --> 28:57.249
I was nine years old.

28:57.250 --> 29:01.169
My mother sent me out for
vegetables with my father.

29:01.170 --> 29:04.769
When we got to the store, the
storekeeper refused to serve him.

29:04.770 --> 29:06.810
Didn't serve 'our kind'.

29:08.210 --> 29:10.249
My father just turned and walked away.

29:10.250 --> 29:14.409
So I told the guy our
money's good as anybody's

29:14.410 --> 29:18.410
and if he couldn't give us what we
needed, we'd just take it.

29:21.610 --> 29:23.609
And did you?

29:23.610 --> 29:25.409
I tried.

29:25.410 --> 29:27.489
He called the cops.

29:27.490 --> 29:33.330
My father, he pleaded with
this policeman to let me go...

29:34.650 --> 29:37.810
...that I was a child, that I didn't
know wrong from right.

29:40.610 --> 29:42.889
They let me go.

29:42.890 --> 29:45.489
When I got home, my mother said to me,

29:45.490 --> 29:49.570
'Ehrie, don't ever let
anyone put you in chains'.

29:51.690 --> 29:54.369
And I never have, except
of my own choosing.

29:54.370 --> 29:58.169
That night I went back, I put
a brick through the window,

29:58.170 --> 30:00.530
and took all the
vegetables I could carry.

30:05.210 --> 30:07.210
I'll go find Doyle.

30:08.850 --> 30:10.890
We should start our search for Rosie.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.530
(GRUNTS)

31:02.410 --> 31:04.010
Doyle?

31:05.770 --> 31:07.369
Doyle?

31:07.370 --> 31:09.010
Doyle!

31:16.090 --> 31:19.449
Doyle! Doyle!

31:19.450 --> 31:23.329
Hey! Hey! What happened?

31:23.330 --> 31:26.529
Come on. What are you doing all the
way out here in your...?

31:26.530 --> 31:28.489
Come on, get up.

31:28.490 --> 31:30.770
I saw one.

31:31.930 --> 31:33.650
White skin, dark eyes.

31:34.690 --> 31:37.930
OK. OK, let's get you warmed up,
or at least dressed.

31:45.330 --> 31:47.329
The same creatures that Daniel saw?

31:47.330 --> 31:49.489
Maybe you have Rimsky-Korsakoff
syndrome?

31:49.490 --> 31:52.010
Your eyelids are droopy
and all that other stuff.

31:53.250 --> 31:55.449
They must have used
some sort of substance.

31:55.450 --> 31:57.169
They must have used some sort of
I have a bad taste in my mouth.

31:57.170 --> 31:58.809
You think they drugged you?

31:58.810 --> 32:02.244
That, or I donated my clothes

32:02.246 --> 32:04.065
to the Salvation Army
in the middle of the night (!)

32:04.067 --> 32:05.596
Oh, good, your sarcasm's back.

32:05.598 --> 32:09.049
If the aliens are still here, then
we have a chance at finding Rosie.

32:09.050 --> 32:12.089
The curious thing is they
left me exactly where I was,

32:12.090 --> 32:14.649
but they moved Daniel to
a different location. Why?

32:14.650 --> 32:16.769
That first location must be the key.

32:16.770 --> 32:19.129
They don't want anyone
to know they're here.

32:19.442 --> 32:21.091
They must have moved Daniel

32:21.091 --> 32:23.231
because they don't want their
hiding place to be discovered.

32:23.333 --> 32:26.911
I'll check on Booth. He should have
his search party together by now.

32:28.130 --> 32:29.810
We should get a head start.

32:36.610 --> 32:39.410
If I were an alien, where would I hide?

32:41.850 --> 32:43.650
Maybe they'll show us.

32:44.690 --> 32:46.409
Birds?

32:46.410 --> 32:48.250
Bats.

32:51.050 --> 32:53.210
Where there's bats, there's caves.

33:16.010 --> 33:17.729
Wow.

33:17.730 --> 33:21.370
Nice, huh? They call it a flashlight.
Got it in the States.

33:36.250 --> 33:38.250
I've been an idiot.

33:39.610 --> 33:41.289
Deafening silence.

33:41.290 --> 33:43.730
My prejudices blinded me.

33:45.050 --> 33:48.529
When Daniel gave his meandering
account of monsters and whatnot,

33:48.530 --> 33:50.889
all I could think of was my father

33:50.890 --> 33:54.689
and his own drunk,
nonsensical ramblings.

33:54.690 --> 33:59.129
'Insensibly one begins to
twist facts to suit theories,

33:59.130 --> 34:01.729
instead of theories to suit facts.'

34:01.730 --> 34:04.289
Wait, you're quoting... me.

34:04.290 --> 34:06.130
That was you?

34:09.650 --> 34:11.650
(RATTLING)

34:13.489 --> 34:15.210
Somebody's been here.

34:29.650 --> 34:32.208
And you leapt to Daniel's side

34:32.210 --> 34:35.728
because of your own prejudices,
in favour of the underdog.

34:35.730 --> 34:38.609
It's important, isn't it, that
I'm just as wrong as you?

34:38.610 --> 34:40.649
No, that you're just as honest as me.

34:40.650 --> 34:44.049
How about this? I actually enjoyed
being the believer.

34:44.050 --> 34:47.009
Accepting everything unquestioningly.

34:47.010 --> 34:48.649
It's like a vacation.

34:48.650 --> 34:51.409
And I enjoyed playing the
cynic, gainsaying everything

34:51.409 --> 34:53.768
and stooping to ad hominem arguments.

34:53.770 --> 34:55.768
And stooping to ad hominem
It was refreshingly unimaginative.

34:55.770 --> 34:57.810

35:16.004 --> 35:18.843
We heard one of their lot seen
the monster what took Rosie.

35:18.844 --> 35:21.963
We need volunteers to search
for her, not an angry mob.

35:21.964 --> 35:23.683
We'll search for her all right.

35:23.684 --> 35:25.723
What the hell is he doing out?

35:25.724 --> 35:28.883
He's been telling the truth, which
means he can help us find Rosie.

35:28.884 --> 35:30.723
Not now, Jim.

35:30.724 --> 35:34.883
Your pregnant niece is out there.
Are we going to look for her?

35:34.884 --> 35:38.244
Or am I going to have to render you
unconscious and lock you up first?

36:12.164 --> 36:14.563
Not that I want to throw
you off your game,

36:14.564 --> 36:16.403
but we're in a bit of a pickle here.

36:16.404 --> 36:18.283
Can you work any faster?

36:18.284 --> 36:21.524
My escapes are the result
of extensive preparation.

36:23.884 --> 36:25.924
What kind of aliens use rope anyhow?

36:27.284 --> 36:29.444
The same kind that use oil lamps.

36:30.684 --> 36:33.964
What did they build their spacecraft
out of? Bamboo and twine (?)

36:54.844 --> 36:58.244
By 'extensive preparation' did
you mean 'broken oil lamp'?

37:01.444 --> 37:05.443
Ha-ha-ha! Any other jokes you wanna
make before you cut me free?

37:05.444 --> 37:07.484
We've got time, right (?)

here and never left.)

must have come up to investigate.)

and Rosie.)

(Houdini)...

39:01.364 --> 39:03.524
I apologise for the bonds.

39:04.426 --> 39:07.644
We were preparing to escape
when we came across you.

39:08.844 --> 39:10.843
We needed to delay.

39:10.844 --> 39:12.964
We still do.

39:19.164 --> 39:20.803
Watch yourself.

39:20.804 --> 39:22.484
I'm watching you.

39:29.204 --> 39:31.643
- What did you do with Rosie?
- We helped her.

39:31.644 --> 39:35.123
When they discovered us,
so close to our home,

39:35.124 --> 39:36.963
we didn't know what to do.

39:36.964 --> 39:39.243
She fell and hurt her head.

39:39.244 --> 39:41.523
She was with child.

39:41.524 --> 39:44.764
We couldn't leave her, so
we carried her back here.

39:46.204 --> 39:47.803
She's here?

39:47.804 --> 39:49.843
Resting.

39:49.844 --> 39:51.884
She's fine.

39:55.644 --> 39:59.083
My grandfather was a doctor.
He taught me much.

39:59.084 --> 40:01.923
You used a compound to
knock me unconscious.

40:01.924 --> 40:04.603
We do what we have to do to survive,

40:04.604 --> 40:08.763
just as we have to steal food
and clothes from time to time

40:08.764 --> 40:10.803
but we never intend to harm.

40:10.804 --> 40:13.883
You must have known when you took
Rosie you would be discovered.

40:13.884 --> 40:15.523
People would look for her.

40:15.524 --> 40:18.163
We were waiting till
she was well enough

40:18.164 --> 40:21.043
but now we must leave immediately.

40:21.044 --> 40:22.804
You need to come to the surface.

40:26.204 --> 40:28.203
We were born down here.

40:28.204 --> 40:31.044
We only go out at night when it's safe.

40:32.084 --> 40:34.243
We wouldn't survive in your world.

40:34.244 --> 40:37.083
- It's your world too.
- You need sunlight.

40:37.084 --> 40:40.203
You have rickets, and
probably lead poisoning.

40:40.204 --> 40:42.363
You're not safe down here.

40:42.364 --> 40:45.243
We're not safe up there.
They will kill us.

40:45.244 --> 40:48.083
I remember the stories my father told.

40:48.084 --> 40:50.123
These people are monsters.

40:50.124 --> 40:52.283
Cruel.

40:52.284 --> 40:54.564
Murderous.

40:55.724 --> 40:57.883
Our families were tired of running.

40:57.884 --> 40:59.524
You're still running.

41:00.564 --> 41:02.164
Hiding is no different.

You have to fight for
your place in this world.

to adjust to the light.

There they are!

They're the monsters who took Rosie.

41:50.964 --> 41:53.803
- Where is she?
- They're not monsters, they're people.

41:53.804 --> 41:56.323
- They look like monsters to me.
- They attacked us.

- Damn you!
- No!

42:17.404 --> 42:19.803
- They saved my life.
- This lot?

42:19.804 --> 42:22.443
Then the baby came.

42:22.444 --> 42:24.484

Neither will I.

They're people too, Uncle
Jim, just like you and me.

looked after in the hospital.

Hey! A telegram came for you at the
station.

43:09.324 --> 43:11.123
I checked in on Martha.

43:11.124 --> 43:13.484
She wanted to give you
these for the journey.

43:25.764 --> 43:27.764
(TRAIN WHISTLES BLOWS)

43:32.004 --> 43:33.644
You took something from me.

From my satchel.

43:40.404 --> 43:42.083
And then you put it back.

43:42.084 --> 43:44.763
I hope you found what
you were looking for.

43:44.764 --> 43:46.563
Not quite.

43:46.564 --> 43:48.684
Why'd you change your name?

43:51.004 --> 43:54.003
I just thought 'Adelaide'
had a nice ring to it.

43:54.004 --> 43:59.243
I think... your husband was having an
affair with Nigel Pennington.

43:59.244 --> 44:02.243
What? You thought my husband was...

44:02.244 --> 44:04.283
We saw him in a photo with George Ives.

44:04.284 --> 44:06.203
George Ives was my husband's cousin.

44:06.204 --> 44:08.723
- Why did your husband kill himself?
- Houdini, really!

44:08.724 --> 44:10.603
You don't wanna hear, cover your ears.

44:10.604 --> 44:12.644
I had someone dig up
the coroner's report.

44:13.804 --> 44:15.523
It was ruled a suicide.

44:15.524 --> 44:17.963
Well, you really know
nothing about my husband.

44:17.964 --> 44:19.803
Which makes me objective. - Houdini?

44:19.804 --> 44:21.483
He would never take his own life.

44:21.484 --> 44:25.044
Look, I know it must've been -
- I believe he was murdered.

danger.
