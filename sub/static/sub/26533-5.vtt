of increased demonic activity.

00:08.138 --> 00:11.489
Would you like to go

00:11.533 --> 00:13.404
to the homecoming tailgate
with me tonight?

00:13.448 --> 00:14.666
I have a thing

00:14.710 --> 00:16.668

CHARITY: I dealt
with Officer Bailey's death

00:30.030 --> 00:32.075
in a way that wouldn't
raise suspicions.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.294
NIKO :
I can't believe it.

00:33.337 --> 00:35.339
Mel, they think he killed
all those people.

00:35.383 --> 00:37.341
Shh...

00:37.385 --> 00:40.605
Would you mind switching
paint cans with me?

It's the middle of the night.

01:20.384 --> 01:21.516
What is going on?

01:24.954 --> 01:27.348
What on earth are you doing?

01:28.262 --> 01:29.219
Blast it.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.830
Harry?

01:31.874 --> 01:33.615
I am so sorry.

01:36.444 --> 01:39.273
A telekinetic forcebolt
of that magnitude

01:39.316 --> 01:41.579
was quite uncalled for.

01:41.623 --> 01:42.972
MACY:
In my defense,

01:43.015 --> 01:45.192
it is 1:00 a.m.,
I am very naked,

01:45.235 --> 01:46.845
and you did warn us that demons
would be coming at us

01:46.889 --> 01:47.759
fast and furious.

01:47.803 --> 01:49.979
But I am friend, not foe.

01:50.022 --> 01:51.676
And while the Elders search
The Book of Shadows

01:51.720 --> 01:55.158
for more hidden spells,
I am here as a substitute.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.551
Substitute, or a new roommate,

01:56.594 --> 01:58.683
'cause you're living
in the attic.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.772
Yeah, we should be
charging you rent.

02:00.816 --> 02:02.078
And while I am here,

02:02.122 --> 02:03.427
providing guidance
and protection

02:03.471 --> 02:04.428
in absence of the Book,

02:04.472 --> 02:07.301
I will occasionally
need to bathe.

02:07.344 --> 02:09.129
Then I suggest you also learn

02:09.172 --> 02:10.695
the meaning
of a closed bathroom door.

02:10.739 --> 02:13.481
Late night bubble baths
are my safe space.

02:13.524 --> 02:16.136
Ooh, maybe we can find a privacy
spell in The Book of Shadows.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.181
Oh, and when are we
gonna get that back?

02:18.225 --> 02:19.356
From the Elders?

02:19.400 --> 02:20.923
Once they've confirmed
there aren't any more

02:20.966 --> 02:25.101
of your mother's little
secret side projects inside.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.364
I'm in need of a
guilt remover spell.

02:27.408 --> 02:29.018
I'm meeting Lucy for coffee
and I haven't seen her

02:29.061 --> 02:32.282
since... the accident.

02:32.326 --> 02:33.457
Accident?

02:34.415 --> 02:36.895
You mean kissing
her boyfriend?

02:36.939 --> 02:40.116
Yes, how does one
accidentally

02:40.160 --> 02:42.292
press one's lips
against another's?

02:42.336 --> 02:45.469
When one has to distract another
from walking into an exorcism.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.036
Are you gonna tell her?

02:47.079 --> 02:49.038
No. Of course not.

02:49.081 --> 02:51.606
That would just hurt her,
mess with her relationship,

02:51.649 --> 02:53.216
and destroy my rep at Kappa.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.218
And it's not like
I'm ever gonna do it again.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.220
MEL:
Guys.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.395
Can you keep it down?

02:58.439 --> 03:00.963
I was up late last night
with Niko.

03:01.006 --> 03:02.878
How is she?I mean,

03:02.921 --> 03:05.489
not only is her partner dead,
but thanks to the Elders,

03:05.533 --> 03:07.796
everyone thinks
he's a serial killer.

03:07.839 --> 03:10.190
So, yeah, not great.

03:10.233 --> 03:12.322
Their methods can
sometimes seem cruel.

03:12.366 --> 03:14.629
Harry, I'm not in the mood.

03:14.672 --> 03:16.370
In a few hours,
I have to take my girlfriend

03:16.413 --> 03:17.980
to visit the grave of the man

03:18.023 --> 03:19.851
whose death
we're responsible for.

03:23.638 --> 03:26.031
NIKO:
It doesn't make any sense.

03:27.294 --> 03:29.339
Trip was my friend.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.167
I just can't believe he...

03:31.211 --> 03:34.692
brutally murdered
three people over Halloween.

03:34.736 --> 03:36.999
It's just so hard to believe.

03:37.042 --> 03:41.569
I just keep telling myself he
confessed in the suicide note,

03:41.612 --> 03:45.094
they found his victims' DNA
at his apartment.

03:45.137 --> 03:47.401
All signs point to him.

03:53.276 --> 03:57.933
The FBI wants to question me.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.804
They want me to tell them
everything I know about Trip,

something to look forward to.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.530
Of course I have.

05:13.574 --> 05:16.098
You have done some amazing
things with epigenetics.

05:16.141 --> 05:19.623
Exactly. Which is why
I'm here in person

05:19.667 --> 05:21.146

05:53.701 --> 05:55.398
It's November.No. Dude.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.444
He met this girl Summer
at the homecoming tailgate,

05:57.487 --> 05:59.446
and he's been under her
sex spell ever since.

It's fairly standard

I couldn't do it.

you think happened?

07:36.281 --> 07:37.544
He pulled the old,

07:37.587 --> 07:40.938
"It's not you, it's me."
But I mean, duh,

07:40.982 --> 07:43.550
I know it's not me.
It must be another woman.

07:43.593 --> 07:46.030

prove it and make sure

he can't deny, by finding out
who he cheated with.

07:48.772 --> 07:51.253
But do you really need
to know who sheis to prove...?

07:51.296 --> 07:53.516
Oh, of course I do.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.780
I mean, if a guy cheats on you,
and you can't figure out

07:56.824 --> 08:01.306
who he cheated with,
did it even really happen?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.484

deep dive and find out

who Parker cheated with.

We're gonna prove
to the entire school

I haven't told you about Trip

08:45.916 --> 08:47.439
and your mom's death.

08:47.483 --> 08:49.398
What?

08:49.441 --> 08:52.096
Before he died, Trip left me
this weird voice mail.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.446
He said he'd found a link
between your mom's death

08:54.490 --> 08:56.231
and the deaths
of two other women--

08:56.274 --> 08:58.929
one of them in New Orleans

murders and then killed?

Niko, I don't think this is...I know it sounds absurd--

09:13.117 --> 09:15.206

you always believed

09:15.250 --> 09:16.599
your mother's death
wasn't an accident.

Just leave it alone.

The missing DNA vials
were nowhere to be found.

10:01.296 --> 10:04.647

10:49.997 --> 10:52.086

11:02.923 --> 11:04.751
It's not his fault.

11:05.447 --> 11:07.492
And stalking is a bit harsh.

11:07.536 --> 11:11.148

12:07.074 --> 12:08.553
where Trip may have hidden
this evidence.

12:08.597 --> 12:11.121
He has a fishing cabin
up off Grey Hills Lake.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.601
Uh, he took me there once.

12:12.644 --> 12:14.168

12:14.211 --> 12:15.430
Wait, what about our weekend?

12:15.473 --> 12:17.040
Mel, this could solve
your mom's murder

12:17.084 --> 12:19.390

I'll call you back later.

hypnotic pull on men,

13:08.048 --> 13:09.049

13:09.092 --> 13:10.572

13:10.615 --> 13:12.008

of another woman.

13:13.618 --> 13:15.316
No, no, no, no,
it's not demonization

13:15.359 --> 13:16.708

13:16.752 --> 13:18.319

13:33.943 --> 13:37.120

evil on the loose,

13:37.164 --> 13:38.600

13:38.643 --> 13:40.645
such a thing as a "mega-smart
thirst trap she-demon."

13:40.689 --> 13:42.517

Excuse me?

13:42.560 --> 13:43.779

13:43.823 --> 13:44.998
and Forbes 30 Under 30
successful.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.696
Plus, Galvin's acting
super weird,

13:47.739 --> 13:49.263
like his soul
has been snatched by her...

13:49.306 --> 13:50.655
She's exaggerating.

13:50.699 --> 13:53.789
Well, despite your rather
problematic language,

13:53.833 --> 13:56.618

perhaps be a succubus.

to be how old?
I know.

14:08.369 --> 14:11.154
So, how do I know for sure
that I'm totally right?

14:11.198 --> 14:14.375
Ah, well, there are a few
irrefutable visual markers.

14:14.418 --> 14:15.985
Most species have
a tail and wings.

14:16.029 --> 14:19.336
This is getting stupid. She
did not have a tail or wings.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.903
Ah, but, of course,
as most demons do,

14:20.947 --> 14:23.210
they cleverly hide
their inhuman features

14:23.253 --> 14:25.342
with magic, but they
flaunt the suggestion

14:25.386 --> 14:27.301

kill her and not me?

25:04.459 --> 25:07.854
All I know is that shifters
are singular in focus

25:07.897 --> 25:09.420
and relentless in pursuit.

25:09.464 --> 25:11.466
And this one will not rest
until its target is eliminated.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.164
And for some reason,
that target is Niko.

25:15.426 --> 25:17.559
And Niko is just as relentless.

25:18.647 --> 25:20.214
She won't drop
this investigation

25:20.257 --> 25:21.694
now that she's started it.

25:21.737 --> 25:23.609
To be fair, every law
enforcement officer in Hilltowne

25:23.652 --> 25:26.220
is in danger now that demonic
activity has increased.

25:26.263 --> 25:28.352
Yeah, well, she wouldn't
even be in Hilltowne

25:28.396 --> 25:30.398
if it weren't for me.Why?

25:30.441 --> 25:33.532
She was stationed in Lakeview.

25:33.575 --> 25:36.447
She transferred here for me.

25:36.491 --> 25:38.406
I put her in this danger.

25:38.449 --> 25:40.974
You had no idea
things would turn out this way.

25:41.017 --> 25:43.803
Either way, now it's like
she'd be better off

25:43.846 --> 25:45.108
if we'd never...

25:47.241 --> 25:50.505
Wait.

25:50.549 --> 25:54.465
Is there a spell to make it
as if Niko and I never met?

25:54.509 --> 25:58.078
To, like, rewind
and change things?

25:59.470 --> 26:02.952
There is,
isn't there?

26:02.996 --> 26:04.606
Mel, we don't even have
the Book.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.695
Harry, please.

26:06.739 --> 26:09.524
Tell the Elders
I will do anything to save her.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.352
Anything.

26:11.395 --> 26:14.094
This is their fault
for framing Trip, after all.

26:14.137 --> 26:17.184
They owe me this chance
to make it right.

26:17.227 --> 26:18.185
I'll try.

26:18.228 --> 26:19.490
:
Okay.

26:25.105 --> 26:26.367
Okay.

26:30.371 --> 26:32.547
Um... hi.

26:33.548 --> 26:35.637
"Sinister succubus,
hear my spell.

26:35.681 --> 26:39.380
Tempt men no more,
I banish thee back to Hell."

26:39.423 --> 26:41.556
What the hell
did you just call me?

26:41.600 --> 26:43.297
Why isn't she...?I think maybe

26:43.340 --> 26:44.690
she's not...Oh, God.

26:44.733 --> 26:46.953
No. No, no, no, no.

26:46.996 --> 26:49.172
Listen. I get it.

26:49.216 --> 26:51.435
I've done crazy things
when I was jealous and drunk.

26:52.436 --> 26:54.221
Or are you just
super stoned?

26:55.570 --> 26:57.790
Either way,
if you go now,

26:57.833 --> 26:58.878
I won't tell Gal...GALVIN: Hey.

26:58.921 --> 26:59.966
Who's at the door, Summer?

27:02.795 --> 27:04.144
Oh.

27:06.276 --> 27:08.714
There. Maggie, you see it?

27:10.585 --> 27:14.067
See what? What-what are
you talking about, Macy?

27:14.110 --> 27:16.460
Yep, super stoned it is.

27:16.504 --> 27:18.027
Yeah, Mace, I don't see it.

27:18.071 --> 27:19.550
And I don't think
they do, either.

27:19.594 --> 27:21.465
Wait, wh-what, what are you guys

27:21.509 --> 27:22.902
even doing here?

27:22.945 --> 27:25.992
It's nothing, babe,
I left my wallet at the bar,

27:26.035 --> 27:28.516
and Macy was considerate enough
to return it.

27:29.517 --> 27:31.345
Right.

27:33.913 --> 27:35.436
Well, I-I'm...

27:35.479 --> 27:38.961
so exceedingly sorry to
have disturbed your evening.

27:45.576 --> 27:47.709
I'm so sorry for putting
all those "Summer's a demon"

27:47.753 --> 27:49.276
thoughts in your brain.

27:49.319 --> 27:51.670
This is all my fault.

27:51.713 --> 27:55.064
No, it's mine.

27:55.108 --> 27:57.806
I pushed Galvin away,
and it was easier

27:57.850 --> 27:59.852
to tell myself he was
under Summer's spell

27:59.895 --> 28:03.072
than to accept he could be
into someone else so quickly.

28:03.116 --> 28:05.118
I hear that.

28:05.161 --> 28:07.424
I've been telling myself that
that kiss was an accident,

28:07.468 --> 28:12.908
but... I could have distracted
Parker some other way.

28:12.952 --> 28:16.999
You know, on some level,
I... I wanted to kiss him.

28:19.001 --> 28:22.962
Lucy's demonizing Parker,
but...

28:23.005 --> 28:24.093
I'm the real bad guy.

28:26.487 --> 28:28.707
I have to tell her
the truth, don't I?

28:43.809 --> 28:46.812
Mel. Where's Niko

28:46.855 --> 28:49.945
She's fine. For now.

28:49.989 --> 28:52.513
And as soon as we
all do this spell,

28:52.556 --> 28:54.254
she'll be safe for good.

28:54.297 --> 28:56.822
Oh, hey, the Book.

28:56.865 --> 28:57.953
You got it back.

28:57.997 --> 28:59.172
Harry lobbied the Elders.

28:59.215 --> 29:01.261
I only repeated your words, Mel.

29:03.654 --> 29:05.526
What kind of spell is this?

29:05.569 --> 29:08.224
It's a powerful history
rewriting spell.

29:08.268 --> 29:09.704
It requires the Power of Three.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.098
We'd be changing the past.

29:12.141 --> 29:14.230
To make it
as if Niko and I never met.

29:14.274 --> 29:16.842
What?

29:16.885 --> 29:18.452
Mel, why would
you do that?

29:18.495 --> 29:21.629
It's the only way I can
be sure she's safe.

29:21.672 --> 29:24.284
If we never met,
she'll never have gone

29:24.327 --> 29:26.852
to that cabin, that thing
won't be after her anymore.

29:26.895 --> 29:29.419
MACY:
Rewriting history.

29:29.463 --> 29:32.901
It sounds complicated,
dangerous.

29:32.945 --> 29:35.251
It is. There will
be ripple effects

29:35.295 --> 29:36.426
and other unintended
consequences

29:36.470 --> 29:38.080
that simply cannot
be foreseen.

29:38.124 --> 29:39.865
The only beings on Earth
who will remember

29:39.908 --> 29:41.388
the way things were before

29:41.431 --> 29:43.390
are the four of us.Wait, but

29:43.433 --> 29:45.131
can we use it
to undo Trip's death?

29:45.174 --> 29:47.742
Or bring back Mom?

29:47.786 --> 29:49.265
This spell can only affect
the histories

29:49.309 --> 29:50.658
of those still living.

29:50.701 --> 29:53.139
Death is the one thing
that can never be undone.

29:53.182 --> 29:54.793
Which is another reason

29:54.836 --> 29:56.272
I have to protect Niko.

29:58.884 --> 30:02.757
You all need to be
absolutely sure

30:02.801 --> 30:04.411
before you do this.

30:05.673 --> 30:06.979
I know firsthand
that this kind of spell

30:07.022 --> 30:07.806
comes at a huge cost.

30:07.849 --> 30:09.851
I remember nothing

30:09.895 --> 30:13.072
of my human life--
not who I was,

30:13.115 --> 30:15.901
who I loved, or what I did
to become a Whitelighter.

30:15.944 --> 30:17.119
MAGGIE:
Harry...

30:17.163 --> 30:18.860
you really know nothing
about who you were?

30:18.904 --> 30:21.428
Only that I died
in an act

30:21.471 --> 30:23.430
of bravery
that was noticed by the Elders,

30:23.473 --> 30:26.259
and they offered me
the honor of living a new life

30:26.302 --> 30:27.956
in service of the Greater Good.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.262
But I had to sacrifice
the memories

30:29.305 --> 30:31.438
of my old life
so I would have no distractions

30:31.481 --> 30:32.569
from my charges.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.049
Can you ever get them back?

30:34.093 --> 30:35.572
No, at least

30:35.616 --> 30:36.965
no way that I know of.

30:37.009 --> 30:39.315
But I made my
choice long ago.

30:39.359 --> 30:41.535
Now you must make yours.

30:43.363 --> 30:45.539
But before that,
the evidence on Niko's phone,

30:45.582 --> 30:47.541
about your mother...What evidence?

30:47.584 --> 30:48.542
About Mom?

30:48.585 --> 30:50.152
I'll explain later.

30:50.196 --> 30:52.502
Those photos will
vanish once we're done.

30:52.546 --> 30:53.764
If you want to use
that evidence,

30:53.808 --> 30:55.070
study them before we begin.

30:55.114 --> 30:57.812
You'll also lose any
pictures, texts, keepsakes.

30:57.856 --> 31:01.076
Every trace of your
relationship with Niko

31:01.120 --> 31:04.166
will disappear.

31:04.210 --> 31:05.994
Okay.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.215
The only thing
the spell won't touch

31:09.258 --> 31:11.260
are ourmemories.

31:11.304 --> 31:13.262
Mel...

31:14.394 --> 31:16.396
...are you sure you want
to do this?

31:16.439 --> 31:20.966
Either I give her up...

31:21.009 --> 31:23.794
or I lose her.

31:23.838 --> 31:26.101
I have to.

No. You cannot request

34:42.645 --> 34:44.386

she knew in high school

something like that?

not worth it, trying to have

34:53.091 --> 34:55.223
a relationship as a witch.

Even though I don't know how
I'm going to get through this,

35:06.843 --> 35:08.932
at least I have all
these great memories.

35:08.976 --> 35:11.109
You know?

35:18.028 --> 35:20.379
Hey, Harry,
I was thinking.

35:20.422 --> 35:21.510
Hmm?

35:21.554 --> 35:22.685
I know you may not remember

35:22.729 --> 35:24.122
your own family,

35:24.165 --> 35:26.080
so I was thinking maybe
we could be your new one.

35:30.345 --> 35:32.826
I mean, you do already
live with us.

35:32.869 --> 35:35.176
So...

35:35.220 --> 35:38.962
Well, that's, uh...

35:39.006 --> 35:40.181
You are such

35:40.225 --> 35:41.313
an American millennial.

35:43.837 --> 35:46.840
Where was I?
Uh, right.

35:49.843 --> 35:53.455
There you go.
At times like this,

35:53.499 --> 35:56.632
there's nothing more comforting
than a full English breakfast.

35:59.505 --> 36:03.944
Okay... don't let me
obsess like this.

36:03.987 --> 36:06.033
I

36:06.076 --> 36:09.732
I have that evidence that Niko
found about Mom's death.

36:09.776 --> 36:12.213
At least we have something
to follow up on, right?

36:12.257 --> 36:16.478
Okay, well, um...
what did Niko find?

36:16.522 --> 36:19.002
Well, the main thing were these
strange, branching patterns

36:19.046 --> 36:20.265
on all three bodies.

36:20.308 --> 36:22.528
Mom and the other Elders.

36:22.571 --> 36:25.792
Cutaneous bruising
is pretty common.

36:25.835 --> 36:29.970
No. These were
different somehow.

36:30.013 --> 36:31.363
I'll know them
when I see them again.

36:31.406 --> 36:32.973
Indeed, it's tremendously
important that you focus

36:33.016 --> 36:34.496
on that right now.
Also, Macy,

36:34.540 --> 36:36.498
that mark on your friend Galvin.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.108
Summer may not have been
a succubus.

36:38.152 --> 36:39.719
Don't remind me.

36:39.762 --> 36:41.286
Nevertheless,
a mark like that

36:41.329 --> 36:43.244
cannot be dismissed.

36:43.288 --> 36:46.247
He could be in danger,
under a spell or curse.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.118
We need to know exactly
what it looked like.

36:48.162 --> 36:50.556
I do know a technique
for extracting a copy,

36:50.599 --> 36:52.688
but you'll have
to get close to him.

36:52.732 --> 36:54.212
Very close.

36:54.255 --> 36:57.040
Okay, well,
you have fun with that.

36:57.084 --> 36:58.825
I have to go get coffee
with Lucy.

37:00.174 --> 37:01.915
Like, right now.

37:01.958 --> 37:05.353
Um, I'm gonna
tell her the truth

37:05.397 --> 37:06.572
about Parker.

37:06.615 --> 37:08.269
:
Wish me luck.

37:15.929 --> 37:17.452
I know.

37:17.496 --> 37:19.889
I'm an ugly crier.

37:21.543 --> 37:24.329
So tell me.

37:24.372 --> 37:25.895
Who did he cheat with?

37:25.939 --> 37:27.680
I need to focus my rage,

37:27.723 --> 37:31.074
or else my stress breakouts
will never clear up.

37:31.118 --> 37:35.296
You didn't find her because
she doesn't exist, right?

37:35.340 --> 37:37.820
It's not her,
it's not Parker, it's me.

37:37.864 --> 37:40.301
I do this.
I drive men away.

37:40.345 --> 37:42.521
I am just like my mom.

37:42.564 --> 37:44.174
Dad left her
for his CrossFit instructor,

37:44.218 --> 37:46.307
and now she's all alone
with her soft mom arms,

37:46.351 --> 37:49.092
and soon
I will be, too.

37:49.136 --> 37:51.225
N-No, it... it's not you.

37:57.536 --> 37:59.581
Lucy,

37:59.625 --> 38:02.584
it was me.

38:04.107 --> 38:05.370
I kissed Parker.

38:06.719 --> 38:08.721
And I am so, so sorry.

38:08.764 --> 38:10.592
What

38:10.636 --> 38:12.159
How could you?

38:12.202 --> 38:14.901
Do you have feelings
for him?

38:16.990 --> 38:18.600
Look, our sisterhood
is just too important...

38:18.644 --> 38:20.254
Don't you dare

38:20.298 --> 38:22.038
play the sisterhood card
with me.

38:22.082 --> 38:23.518
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

38:23.562 --> 38:25.607
I didn't want to hurt you.

38:25.651 --> 38:28.610
So, instead, you let me
make a fool of myself

38:28.654 --> 38:30.612
by asking for your help.

38:32.788 --> 38:35.791
You are finished at Kappa.

38:37.750 --> 38:41.623
I never want to see
your face ever again.

38:52.765 --> 38:54.070
MEL:
I keep thinking,

38:54.114 --> 38:55.333
"Where is she?"

38:55.376 --> 38:56.856
"What if I run into her?"

38:56.899 --> 38:58.466
Unlikely.

38:58.510 --> 39:00.860
She would never have
moved here, right?

39:05.517 --> 39:06.605
Someone's teaching my class.

39:06.648 --> 39:07.736
Oh, no.

39:07.780 --> 39:08.998
Unintended...

39:09.042 --> 39:12.001
Consequences.

39:13.742 --> 39:15.701
My interview.

39:15.744 --> 39:18.399
I always slept
through my alarm,

39:18.443 --> 39:20.096
and Niko woke me up.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.577
Oh, my God.

39:22.621 --> 39:25.711
I missed my interview.

39:25.754 --> 39:27.800
I never got this job.

39:30.933 --> 39:34.720
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna barge in.

39:34.763 --> 39:37.244
Hey.

39:37.287 --> 39:40.813
Hi.

39:40.856 --> 39:43.163
I know it was weird
between us at the bar,

39:43.206 --> 39:45.687
and then I came
to your place unannounced,

39:45.731 --> 39:47.950
and that was also
very, very weird,

39:47.994 --> 39:50.692
but I-I just wanted to say...

39:50.736 --> 39:53.260
Summer's amazing.

39:53.303 --> 39:56.655
And I'm, I'm really
happy for you.

39:56.698 --> 39:59.048
Okay.

40:00.876 --> 40:03.531
So are we cool?

40:03.575 --> 40:06.447
Sure. Of course we are.

40:10.669 --> 40:13.280
Okay, I got to go.

40:13.323 --> 40:14.890
But I'll see you at work?

40:19.242 --> 40:21.636
HUNTER:
I don't understand.

40:21.680 --> 40:24.160
This morning,
I, I swear I was on track

40:24.204 --> 40:25.814
to get that
Elder witch DNA.

40:25.858 --> 40:26.815
But then something happened.

40:26.859 --> 40:28.730
I'm not quite sure what, but...

40:28.774 --> 40:31.037
But... you failed.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.473
It was the Charmed Ones.

40:32.517 --> 40:33.996
Look, there was some sort
of temporal shift

40:34.040 --> 40:35.607
that threw me off my path.

40:35.650 --> 40:36.782
You felt it, too, didn't you?

40:36.825 --> 40:38.871
All that mystic energy.

40:38.914 --> 40:40.438
Only the Charmed Ones

40:40.481 --> 40:42.962
could have pulled off
a spell that powerful.

40:43.005 --> 40:46.008
I did feel something.

40:46.052 --> 40:48.837
That means
they're getting stronger.

40:48.881 --> 40:51.318
What are you saying, Dad?We need to
get our hands

40:51.361 --> 40:53.712
on powerful witch DNA
without raising suspicion.

40:53.755 --> 40:56.497
And I was happy to steal
it from those Elders

40:56.541 --> 41:01.807
that somebody keeps killing,
but perhaps the Charmed Ones

41:01.850 --> 41:03.461
are our answer.

41:03.504 --> 41:07.682
And I think I know
just how to get it.
