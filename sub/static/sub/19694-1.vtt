01:58.083 --> 01:59.499

How is the sweet little guy?

02:11.500 --> 02:12.916
- Sweet little guy
is turning Mommy and Daddy

02:12.917 --> 02:15.416
into sleep-deprived zombies.

02:15.417 --> 02:16.999
- The motion passes unanimously.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.040
And moving on
to the next order of business,

02:19.041 --> 02:21.165
a motion to approve
the research center funding

02:21.166 --> 02:24.165

02:24.166 --> 02:26.124
- Hey, Jeffrey.

- Coming?

02:38.208 --> 02:39.568
- This concludes
the board meeting.

03:04.875 --> 03:05.875

03:05.875 --> 03:06.875
- Hey.

03:06.876 --> 03:08.416
- You made cookies, yum!

03:08.417 --> 03:09.999
- Nope.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.082
Those are for my class s
field trip tomorrow.

03:13.083 --> 03:14.791
I m out of chocolate chips.

03:14.792 --> 03:16.040
- No.

03:16.041 --> 03:16.875
- Would you go
to the store for me?

03:16.875 --> 03:17.875
- No...

03:17.876 --> 03:19.124
- Please?
- No.

03:19.125 --> 03:20.666

03:20.667 --> 03:22.290
- All right. All right.
Just let me change first.

03:22.291 --> 03:25.624
- Best roommate ever!

03:43.625 --> 03:45.082
- Hey, Veronica.

03:45.083 --> 03:47.249
What are you cooking?

03:47.250 --> 03:50.040
That smells, good.

03:50.041 --> 03:51.457
- We re having an early dinner.

03:51.458 --> 03:53.958
Kale salad, baked salmon,
no butter, no salt.

03:55.291 --> 03:56.916
- You know that your dad
is on a strict diet

03:56.917 --> 03:58.249
for his high blood pressure.

03:58.250 --> 03:59.416
- He s taking this
health kick he s on

03:59.417 --> 04:00.499
to unhealthy levels.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.541
He s obsessed.

04:01.542 --> 04:02.749
- Hey.

04:02.750 --> 04:04.499
I heard that.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.833
- You deserve a raise if he s
making you eat this way too.

04:06.834 --> 04:09.582
- I think it d be a good idea
if all of us ate healthier.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.583
- Couldn t agree more.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.583
- Where you going?

04:11.584 --> 04:12.833
- To get a pizza.

04:12.834 --> 04:14.541
- Will you please pick up
your dad s meds?

04:14.542 --> 04:15.542
- Sure.

04:40.875 --> 04:42.791
- Hey.
Hey, excuse me.

04:42.792 --> 04:44.708
- Hey.

04:44.709 --> 04:46.457

04:46.458 --> 04:47.582
This is a no-parking zone.

04:47.583 --> 04:48.874
- Excuse me?
- You can t park here.

04:48.875 --> 04:50.082
It s for emergency
vehicles only.

04:50.083 --> 04:51.624
- I m only gonna be
a couple minutes.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.874
- Hey! That s not the point.
It doesn t matter.

04:53.875 --> 04:55.040
- Are you the police?

04:55.041 --> 04:56.041
- No.

04:56.041 --> 04:57.041
- Good.

04:57.042 --> 04:58.457
- If there is an emergency,

04:58.458 --> 05:00.958
an ambulance and a fire truck
can t park here.

05:00.959 --> 05:04.374
- If there s an emergency,
I ll move my car.

05:04.375 --> 05:06.290
- No, you don t understand.
Every second counts.

05:06.291 --> 05:08.499
You... Jerk.

05:08.500 --> 05:09.541
Okay.

05:09.542 --> 05:10.792
Fine.

05:13.417 --> 05:16.749
- Cam, we need a hook-up at the
Food Mart in the Plaza on PCH.

05:16.750 --> 05:17.750
- We re on it.

05:30.667 --> 05:31.874
- Whoa.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

05:31.875 --> 05:33.082
Hey.
- Vehicle was...

05:33.083 --> 05:34.249
- I m sorry, sir.
It s... I m here.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.332
I m leaving. I...

05:35.333 --> 05:36.416
- Sorry, man, it s too late.

05:36.417 --> 05:37.499
- What do you mean
it s too late?

05:37.500 --> 05:38.500
I m right here.

05:38.501 --> 05:40.040
- I sympathize, man,
I really do.

05:40.041 --> 05:42.249
- Okay. You know what?
Just take... here. There s $500.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.708
Just take that
and lower the car.

05:44.709 --> 05:46.499
- No can do, man.
Look, I got to keep it honest.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.666
- Fantastic.
It s a new car!

05:48.667 --> 05:51.708
So...
Watch the paint.

05:51.709 --> 05:53.332
- Cheers!

05:53.333 --> 05:54.749
- Be careful with it.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.791
- You got it!

05:56.792 --> 05:59.082
- Unbelievable.

05:59.083 --> 06:01.374
You.

06:01.375 --> 06:03.040
- I told you
you shouldn t park there.

06:03.041 --> 06:04.749
- So you, what,
called a tow truck on me?

06:04.750 --> 06:06.040
- No, I called the police

06:06.041 --> 06:07.290
and they called the tow truck.

06:07.291 --> 06:08.374
- You called the cops?

06:08.375 --> 06:09.375
Who do you think you are?

06:09.376 --> 06:10.457
- Who do you think you are?

06:10.458 --> 06:11.999
What if there had been
an emergency?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.290
- There wasn t one.
- So you... you think

06:13.291 --> 06:14.374
that because
you drive an expensive car,

06:14.375 --> 06:15.708
you don t have to
look for a parking spot

06:15.709 --> 06:16.833
like the rest of us.
- Was there one?

06:16.834 --> 06:17.958
- If there had been
an emergency,

06:17.959 --> 06:19.207
and this is the part that you

06:19.208 --> 06:21.457
can t seem to grasp,
every second counts.

06:21.458 --> 06:24.082
- Nothing happened! And who made
you the parking police?

06:24.083 --> 06:25.416
Now, if you ll excuse me,

06:25.417 --> 06:26.999
I have to go to the impound
to pick up my car.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.165
So my dad is gonna have to wait

06:28.166 --> 06:29.916
for his blood-pressure
medication,

06:29.917 --> 06:32.332
so I hope you re happy.

06:32.333 --> 06:33.416
- That s not the point!

06:33.417 --> 06:34.709
And you deserve to be towed!

06:38.750 --> 06:41.833
Some people are just
unbelievable.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.332
- What happened?

06:43.333 --> 06:45.749
- Just this rich,
entitled guy at the store

06:45.750 --> 06:47.791
thinks he s
better than everyone else

06:47.792 --> 06:48.874
because he has money.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.541
- Jeff, is that you?

06:50.542 --> 06:52.749
- Unbelievable.

06:52.750 --> 06:54.374
- Are you all right?
- No.

06:54.375 --> 06:55.874
- What happened?
- My car got towed.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.874
I had to call Jonathan
to come pick me up.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.207
Why couldn t she just
mind her own business?

06:59.208 --> 07:00.166
- Who?

07:00.167 --> 07:01.457
- This infuriating goody-goody

07:01.458 --> 07:03.040
with nothing better to do
than to call the cops

07:03.041 --> 07:05.374
on someone for parking
in a parking spot.

07:05.375 --> 07:06.708
- I had his car towed.

07:07.792 --> 07:09.165
- Girl, you don t mess around.

07:09.166 --> 07:12.999
- She s infuriating.
And self-righteous. And...

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
- Infuriating?

07:14.001 --> 07:15.958
- Yeah.

07:20.834 --> 07:24.165
- 22, code 3, 186 Patton Road,
Cross street is...

07:24.166 --> 07:27.916
- You ve been refreshing
your email for over an hour.

07:27.917 --> 07:28.917
- I m supposed to hear back from

07:28.918 --> 07:31.082
my med school applications
any day now.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.249
- Don t worry, you ll get in.

07:33.250 --> 07:34.749
- Charlie 8-12.

07:44.875 --> 07:46.040
- Let s do this.

07:52.875 --> 07:53.709

07:53.710 --> 07:55.374
Try not to move.

07:55.375 --> 07:56.833
- Son,
I don t need an ambulance.

07:56.834 --> 07:58.959
I just need some ice.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.374
- Is your husband conscious?

08:12.375 --> 08:13.874
- Yes.
Though Rex isn t my husband.

08:13.875 --> 08:15.541
I m the house manager.

08:15.542 --> 08:18.207
I ve been with the family since
Rex s wife passed 12 years ago.

08:18.208 --> 08:19.499
- Can you tell us what happened?

08:19.500 --> 08:22.541
- He tripped over a dumbbell
doing a Zumba workout.

08:22.542 --> 08:23.959
I m afraid he broke his arm.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.541
- I... I told you
I didn t need... I...

08:29.542 --> 08:30.999
I just need some ice.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.207

08:32.207 --> 08:34.749
I m a paramedic.
And this is Nick.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.039
Look, this isn t necessary.

My home.

08:46.208 --> 08:47.374

08:47.375 --> 08:49.624
Do you know what day it is?

08:49.625 --> 08:52.833
- My goodness.

08:52.834 --> 08:54.457

on a scale to ten?

08:55.625 --> 08:56.791
- Four.

08:56.792 --> 08:59.457

09:00.792 --> 09:02.165
- Here you go.

09:22.667 --> 09:25.207

09:25.208 --> 09:26.332
- You re a great teacher.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.666
- Thanks, babe.

09:27.667 --> 09:28.874
- Well, before you go,

09:28.875 --> 09:30.249
there s something
extremely important

09:30.250 --> 09:31.582
I need to talk to you about.
- What s that?

09:31.583 --> 09:33.332
- What exactly are we doing for
your birthday this year?

09:33.333 --> 09:35.082
- I m not having a birthday
this year.

09:35.083 --> 09:37.165
- Are you kidding me?
Baby, you love your birthday.

09:37.166 --> 09:39.165
- I m serious.
I m turning 30.

09:39.166 --> 09:40.874
No party, no presents, nothing.

09:40.875 --> 09:42.207
- Baby, your birthday s
gonna come

09:42.208 --> 09:43.416
whether you want it to or not.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.666
You might as well celebrate.

09:45.667 --> 09:47.708
Look at the time.

09:47.709 --> 09:51.040
Come on. All right.

09:51.041 --> 09:53.165
But this discussion is not over.

09:53.166 --> 09:54.666
- Yeah, yeah.

09:54.667 --> 09:57.249
- If Rex exhibits any symptoms,
dizziness, pain,

09:57.250 --> 09:59.332
please don t hesitate
to call us again.

09:59.333 --> 10:00.208
- I can t thank you enough.

10:00.209 --> 10:01.874
- You re welcome.

10:01.875 --> 10:03.374
- I don t know what I d do
if something happened to him.

10:03.375 --> 10:05.040
Thanks again.

10:05.041 --> 10:07.040
- Excuse me?
Um, I wanted to thank you.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.207
I really appreciate
what you did for my father.

10:09.208 --> 10:10.916
- Well, that s
what we re here for.

10:10.917 --> 10:14.040

10:15.250 --> 10:18.791
- Lilly.
Um.

10:18.792 --> 10:21.624
What do you say to dinner,
Friday night?

10:21.625 --> 10:23.916
- Thanks, but no thanks.

10:23.917 --> 10:24.917
- Wait, what?

10:33.709 --> 10:35.249
She said no.

10:36.709 --> 10:38.040
- No, I m serious.
She wasn t playing hard to get.

10:38.041 --> 10:39.791
She really meant it.

10:39.792 --> 10:40.874
- Everyone goes through the pain

10:40.875 --> 10:42.624
and humiliation
of being rejected.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.709
You ll survive.
I think this ll be good for you.

10:57.625 --> 11:02.040
- Batch 11, I got a 36002.
6002...

11:02.041 --> 11:03.041
- What s the cross?

11:03.042 --> 11:04.874
- So how is Baby Everett?

11:04.875 --> 11:07.040
- Everett screamed for about
five hours straight last night.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.582
- Aww, poor boy,
crying all night.

11:09.583 --> 11:10.917
- Yeah, everybody was crying.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.082
- I have a delivery
for Lilly Springler?

11:23.083 --> 11:25.582
- Ooh, wow.
Those flowers are beautiful.

11:25.583 --> 11:27.416
- Someone has an admirer.

11:27.417 --> 11:28.542
- Thank you.

11:35.458 --> 11:38.541
"How bout that dinner?
Call me."

11:38.542 --> 11:41.457
Could you please put those
at the nurses station?

11:41.458 --> 11:42.458
- Sure.

11:42.459 --> 11:43.958
- You don t want the flowers?

11:43.959 --> 11:45.039
- I don t want the admirer.

11:59.542 --> 12:00.542
- Any word yet?

12:02.542 --> 12:03.542
- She ll call.

12:05.583 --> 12:06.583
Thanks.

12:09.041 --> 12:11.207
- Hi.
Delivery for Lilly Springler.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.833
- Your admirer strikes again.

12:16.834 --> 12:17.834
- Thank you.

12:21.083 --> 12:23.749
"Forget dinner.
How about dessert?

12:23.750 --> 12:25.708
You have my number.
Jeff."

12:25.709 --> 12:28.374
- He didn t seem that bad
when we went to his house.

12:28.375 --> 12:31.374
- I have no interest
in Jeff Alexander.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.874
- You ve complained in the past
about dating guys

12:32.875 --> 12:34.666
who didn t put in any effort.

12:34.667 --> 12:37.290
This guy s putting in
some effort at least.

12:37.291 --> 12:38.457
- Okay,
then I ll write him a note

12:38.458 --> 12:39.582
to thank him for the candy.

12:39.583 --> 12:41.791
But I m not going out with him.

12:41.792 --> 12:43.749
- Hey, whoa-whoa.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.874
It s sacrilegious
to chocoholics around the world

12:45.875 --> 12:47.457
to throw those away,
you realize this?

12:47.458 --> 12:49.040
- You re welcome to them.

13:00.208 --> 13:01.708
- Okay.

13:01.709 --> 13:03.416
After the meeting
with the veterans group,

13:03.417 --> 13:05.374
we have dinner
with the president

13:05.375 --> 13:06.916
of the animal shelter.

13:06.917 --> 13:08.416
Jeff?

13:08.417 --> 13:09.666
- Yeah.

13:09.667 --> 13:13.708
Veterans group,
animal shelter, got it.

13:13.709 --> 13:14.874
- You know,
Lilly called Veronica

13:14.875 --> 13:15.875
to check up on me?

13:17.750 --> 13:19.207
- That was thoughtful.

13:19.208 --> 13:21.082
- I was extremely impressed
with their professionalism

13:21.083 --> 13:23.874
and their response time.

13:23.875 --> 13:25.207
- We should do something.

13:25.208 --> 13:26.708
To thank the medical center.

13:26.709 --> 13:28.040
- Excellent idea.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.041
- I ll check into it.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.207
- Okay.

13:33.583 --> 13:36.082
- Duncroft Advertising,
Vince Rossmore s office.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.708
Hey, Meggers, how are ya?

13:38.709 --> 13:40.791
Yeah, sure.

13:40.792 --> 13:42.874
Your luminous lady on line one.

13:42.875 --> 13:43.875
- Thanks, Finn.

13:43.876 --> 13:44.917
- Anytime.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.457
- Hey, babe.

13:56.458 --> 13:58.708
- Hey. I have a couple minutes
until my next class.

14:00.417 --> 14:03.666
- Hey, babe... I m so sorry,
I need to take this call.

14:03.667 --> 14:05.347
I love you.
Babe, I ll call you right back.

14:07.583 --> 14:09.124
Hey, Keely.
- Hey you.

14:09.125 --> 14:10.290
- How are you?

14:10.291 --> 14:12.249
- Insanely busy.

14:12.250 --> 14:14.916
But I definitely
have time for you.

14:14.917 --> 14:16.916
- Great.
So when can we meet?

14:16.917 --> 14:19.708
- How s tomorrow?
Lunch?

14:19.709 --> 14:20.999
- Yeah, Megan will be at school

14:21.000 --> 14:22.165
so that works for me.

14:22.166 --> 14:23.374
- Perfect.
I ll see you soon.

14:23.375 --> 14:24.542
- All right.
Bye.

14:29.250 --> 14:31.791
- There you are.
Lilly, Nick.

14:31.792 --> 14:33.124
- What s up, Dr. R.?

14:33.125 --> 14:34.958
- I received
a phone call yesterday.

14:34.959 --> 14:36.708
Thanks to you and Nick,

14:36.709 --> 14:40.833
the medical center is getting
an extremely generous donation.

14:40.834 --> 14:41.958
- That s wonderful!

14:41.959 --> 14:43.165
- That s fantastic news.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.457
- I invited our patron in today

14:44.458 --> 14:45.958
to get a tour of the facility.

14:45.959 --> 14:50.457
May I present Jeff Alexander
of the Rex Alexander Foundation.

14:50.458 --> 14:53.207
We are extremely grateful
for your generosity.

14:53.208 --> 14:55.499
- Well, thank you, Dr. Richwood,
for having me come down today.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.457
Um, we just wanted
to show our appreciation

14:57.458 --> 15:00.249
for the wonderful care
of my father, Rex.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.874
- We appreciate it.

15:01.875 --> 15:03.165
In fact, we wish
we could adequately

15:03.166 --> 15:05.332
show our gratitude.

15:05.333 --> 15:07.833
- Well, I ve never
gone for a ride

15:07.834 --> 15:09.708
in an ambulance before.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.249
It s a childhood thing, just,
it s silly. I, you know...

15:12.250 --> 15:13.541
- Well, why don t you
go for a ride along

15:13.542 --> 15:15.833
with Nick and Lilly this week?

15:15.834 --> 15:18.374
- I...
I couldn t.

15:18.375 --> 15:21.040
- No, I think we could make
that happen.

15:21.041 --> 15:22.165
Right?

15:22.166 --> 15:23.916
- Okay. Fine.

15:23.917 --> 15:24.917
- Fantastic.

15:30.834 --> 15:32.207
- Fantastic.

15:32.208 --> 15:34.332
- I don t think
this is a good idea.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.833
- We re not breaking
any rules or laws

15:35.834 --> 15:37.582
with a ride along.

15:37.583 --> 15:39.290
- In life or death situations,

15:39.291 --> 15:40.874
having a person like Jeff
around...

15:40.875 --> 15:42.958
- Like Jeff?

15:42.959 --> 15:45.708
- He s not trained.
He s not certified.

15:45.709 --> 15:48.207
If we re transporting a patient,
he could get in the way.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.582
- Lilly, let me just remind you
that the Alexanders are

15:50.583 --> 15:53.416
extremely generous patrons
in our community.

15:53.417 --> 15:55.374
If Jeff wants to go
for a ride along,

15:55.375 --> 15:57.874
I don t see the problem
in indulging him.

15:57.875 --> 15:59.708
- Yes, ma am.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.875
- And don t worry, Lilly,
it s only for a few days.

16:06.208 --> 16:07.708
- So we took the G3 to London...

16:07.709 --> 16:09.332
For this big charity event.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.708
And she asks if
in England the pilot

16:11.709 --> 16:14.874
has to fly on the wrong side of
the sky.

16:14.875 --> 16:17.040
Well, that was the end
of Miss October.

16:20.041 --> 16:22.374
- Miss November?
Completely different story.

16:22.375 --> 16:24.499
She says she can t wear
the Christian Louboutins

16:24.500 --> 16:26.082
because she s not religious.

16:30.500 --> 16:31.708
- And now this guy
is invading my work life.

16:31.709 --> 16:33.541
- Are you kidding me?

16:33.542 --> 16:35.916
- Dr. Richwood was so impressed
with his donation that she would

16:35.917 --> 16:37.833
let him move into the medical
center if he wanted.

16:37.834 --> 16:39.332
And this is the guy who

16:39.333 --> 16:40.833
sent you the flowers
and expensive chocolates?

16:40.834 --> 16:43.416
- This is the guy who threw a
public tantrum because he had to

16:43.417 --> 16:44.999
follow the same rules
as everyone else.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.499
You know, nothing annoys me more

16:47.500 --> 16:49.460
than someone who just
pays their way through life.

16:51.417 --> 16:53.999
What are you doing?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.416
- Moisturizing.

16:55.417 --> 16:56.833
Your hands are
a dead giveaway of your age

16:56.834 --> 17:00.040
because the skin is thin
and wrinkles easily.

17:00.041 --> 17:01.290
Come on, now let me
see this guy.

17:01.291 --> 17:02.708
- Okay.
Don t touch my computer.

17:02.709 --> 17:04.083
- Why would I touch your
computer?

17:09.458 --> 17:12.374
Your guy s Jeff Alexander
of the Rex Alexander Foundation?

17:12.375 --> 17:14.582
- You know him?
And he s not my guy.

17:14.583 --> 17:17.082
- They re huge contributors
to the arts programs at school.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.958
- I don t know, maybe you
should give him a chance.

17:19.959 --> 17:20.959
- What, no?

17:20.960 --> 17:22.708
I have worked so hard

17:22.709 --> 17:24.415
to get where I am
and for everything I have.

17:24.416 --> 17:26.374
I have zero respect
for someone who was

17:26.375 --> 17:28.415
given everything
on a silver platter

17:28.416 --> 17:29.708
and therefore has no integrity

17:29.709 --> 17:32.207
and just expects us
all to cater to his whims.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.416
- That s some speech.

17:33.417 --> 17:34.958
- Do you remember
when I was short-listed

17:34.959 --> 17:36.374
for Barnsley Medical College?

17:36.375 --> 17:38.374
- Yeah.
That was your dream school.

17:38.375 --> 17:40.165
You were number one
on the wait list.

17:40.166 --> 17:42.332
You know why I didn t get in?

17:42.333 --> 17:43.541
Carlton Strand.

17:43.542 --> 17:46.416
His parents made a huge donation
to the school.

17:46.417 --> 17:48.124
- That s so wrong.
- Yeah.

17:48.125 --> 17:50.165
Carlton was 22 on the wait list.

17:50.166 --> 17:52.082
I was number one.

17:52.083 --> 17:53.834
Guess who got in.
It wasn t me.

17:55.417 --> 18:00.499
- Well, I wouldn t mind
the lifestyle.

18:00.500 --> 18:03.290
- I buy day-old bread
and shop the sale racks,

18:03.291 --> 18:04.624
and I have enough student debt

18:04.625 --> 18:05.874
that I won t pay it off
for a decade.

18:07.291 --> 18:11.124
- Jeff Alexander and I
have nothing in common.

18:11.125 --> 18:12.374
- You can always moisturize.

18:12.375 --> 18:13.375
- Yeah, give me some.

18:17.542 --> 18:18.874
- So I m explaining
to the triage nurse,

18:18.875 --> 18:20.791
and she asks me if the patient

18:20.792 --> 18:22.624
had explained to me
what happened, right?

18:22.625 --> 18:25.124
I said, "No, she was just
a little tongue-tied."

18:26.375 --> 18:27.541
- He always tells this story.

18:27.542 --> 18:29.666
You need new material.

18:29.667 --> 18:31.582
- I didn t know you could
cook eggs in a microwave.

18:31.583 --> 18:32.500
- You can cook anything
in a microwave.

18:33.917 --> 18:34.875
- And then there s
the chainsaw guy.

18:34.876 --> 18:36.207
This is a true story.

18:36.208 --> 18:38.374
- Nick!
That is not a breakfast story.

18:38.375 --> 18:40.541
- Lilly s right.
I ll tell you at lunch.

18:41.834 --> 18:43.541
1138. Code 3.

18:43.542 --> 18:44.666
- Whoa...
- Let s go.

18:44.667 --> 18:45.874
- What s a code 3?

18:45.875 --> 18:47.499
- Means we have to hurry.
Are you coming?

18:47.500 --> 18:49.333
- Yeah. Yeah.

18:54.375 --> 18:55.375
- Driving.

18:55.376 --> 18:56.541
- I m driving this time.

18:56.542 --> 18:58.833
- Darn it.
Take the jump seat in the back.

18:58.834 --> 18:59.834
- Let s go.

19:24.417 --> 19:25.417
- Where s your mom?

19:25.417 --> 19:26.417
- In the kitchen.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.457
- You did well calling us.

19:34.125 --> 19:36.374
- Hey there.

19:36.375 --> 19:39.124
I m, I m Jeff.
What s your name?

19:39.125 --> 19:40.290
- Carter.

19:40.291 --> 19:41.374
- How old are you, Carter?

19:41.375 --> 19:42.457
- Seven.

19:42.458 --> 19:44.290
- Seven?

19:44.291 --> 19:46.541
Wow.
You re a big guy.

19:46.542 --> 19:47.874
- Is your mom diabetic?

19:47.875 --> 19:50.040
- Yeah.
She s always testing her blood.

19:50.041 --> 19:52.040
- Low glycemia.
Get the D-5.

19:52.041 --> 19:54.332
- On it.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.709
- Hey.
Want to play catch? Yeah?

20:00.542 --> 20:01.542
- Tape.

20:13.834 --> 20:18.040
- Easy does it.

20:19.291 --> 20:22.040
I started feeling faint,

20:22.041 --> 20:24.916
and it all happened so fast.

20:24.917 --> 20:25.917
- You were lucky
you were wearing

20:25.918 --> 20:27.499
your medical bracelet.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.082
- How did... how did you...

20:29.083 --> 20:31.624
- Your son called 911.

20:31.625 --> 20:33.040
- Where is he?

20:33.041 --> 20:34.041
- You know,
Lilly and Nick helped

20:34.042 --> 20:36.082
my dad when he was hurt.

20:36.083 --> 20:37.958
- Is your dad sick like my mom?

20:37.959 --> 20:41.165
- No. He s okay.

20:41.166 --> 20:43.250
But when I was your age?
My mom got really sick.

20:46.417 --> 20:48.416
- Were you always
worried about your mom?

20:48.417 --> 20:52.499
Were you always really scared?

20:52.500 --> 20:54.124
- Yeah.

20:54.125 --> 20:55.541
I was always worried about her.

20:55.542 --> 20:57.249
It s tough when you re worried

20:57.250 --> 20:59.207
about the people you love?

20:59.208 --> 21:02.040
- Yeah.

21:02.041 --> 21:03.999
- Go long, all right? That s it.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.332
Ready? Here we go.

21:07.333 --> 21:11.040
What a catch!
Yes! Come here.

21:11.041 --> 21:14.207
Yeah! Yes.

21:14.208 --> 21:18.040
Hey, come here.
Hey.

21:18.041 --> 21:19.541
- We need to go.

21:19.542 --> 21:22.708
Now, Carter,
your mom is going to be okay.

21:22.709 --> 21:24.290
But we re gonna take her
to a hospital

21:24.291 --> 21:26.249
where a doctor can
take a look at her, all right?

21:26.250 --> 21:29.040
Do you want to ride
in the ambulance?

21:29.041 --> 21:32.249
- I bet you
if you ask real nice,

21:32.250 --> 21:33.874
Lilly might let you
turn on the sirens.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.708
Can I?

21:35.709 --> 21:36.958
I ll even let you
turn on the lights.

21:36.959 --> 21:38.041
Cool!

21:57.291 --> 21:59.082
- Hey, Finn.
- Meggers, hi!

21:59.083 --> 22:00.000
- Is Vince in?
- Yup.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
- Thank you.

22:03.750 --> 22:04.916
Knock knock.

22:04.917 --> 22:06.416
- Megan?

22:06.417 --> 22:08.040
Hey.

22:08.041 --> 22:09.332
What are you doing here?

22:09.333 --> 22:10.708
- Half day
for teacher conferences.

22:12.709 --> 22:15.708
- I thought I d surprise you
and we could get lunch.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.916
- Um, sorry, babe, I... I can t.

22:17.917 --> 22:20.333
Actually, I m supposed to be
at lunch right now.

22:23.875 --> 22:25.333
I m gonna be
working late all week.

22:28.875 --> 22:32.207
- Yeah. Sure. Fine.

22:32.208 --> 22:34.416
- You re the best, babe.

22:34.417 --> 22:36.375
I ll see you later.

22:42.959 --> 22:44.916
- I owe you an apology.

22:44.917 --> 22:46.958
I understand now
why you were so upset

22:46.959 --> 22:49.290
about me parking
in the emergency zone.

22:49.291 --> 22:52.374
Every second does matter.
I m sorry.

22:52.375 --> 22:55.040
- Thank you for your apology.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.916
- Didn t have to tow my car,
but...

22:56.917 --> 23:00.958
Okay. Maybe you did.

23:00.959 --> 23:04.749
What do you say we start over?
Clean slate?

23:04.750 --> 23:05.750
- Clean slate.

23:07.333 --> 23:08.958
- You know, I feel for Carter.

23:08.959 --> 23:10.374
Been there.

23:10.375 --> 23:12.624
- Your mom?

23:12.625 --> 23:14.582
I m sorry.

23:14.583 --> 23:15.708
- Kids shouldn t have to
deal with

23:15.709 --> 23:17.165
adult issues.

23:17.166 --> 23:18.249
- I agree.

23:18.250 --> 23:21.624
- Hey.
We agree on something.

23:21.625 --> 23:23.040
- Apparently.

23:23.041 --> 23:24.241
- How do you feel about sushi?

23:28.625 --> 23:30.000
- Sure, why not?

23:37.417 --> 23:39.916
- Hey you.

23:39.917 --> 23:41.416
- Nice car.
- Thank you.

23:41.417 --> 23:42.916
- It suits you.
- You like?

23:42.917 --> 23:44.624
You ready?

23:44.625 --> 23:45.625
- Yeah, come on.

23:45.626 --> 23:47.040
- All right, let s go.

23:47.041 --> 23:49.124
- You sure about this place?

23:49.125 --> 23:51.749
- Okay. I know it doesn t
look like much from the outside,

23:51.750 --> 23:53.874
but don t judge
until you see the inside, okay?

23:53.875 --> 23:54.916
- All right.
- All right.

23:54.917 --> 23:56.208
I got you, I promise.

23:58.834 --> 24:00.541
- I got it.
- Thank you.

24:00.542 --> 24:02.166
Let me get the light.

24:07.834 --> 24:11.332
So?

24:11.333 --> 24:13.040
What do you think?

24:13.041 --> 24:14.916
Wow.

24:14.917 --> 24:17.374
Well, I d like to place
some tables over there.

24:17.375 --> 24:20.249
I d like to place
the dance floor here.

24:20.250 --> 24:24.207
And there s a space over there
for a DJ.

24:24.208 --> 24:27.040
- Well, you were right.
This place is perfect.

24:27.041 --> 24:29.833
- I could get you a 15% discount

24:29.834 --> 24:32.541
if we book today.

24:32.542 --> 24:34.708
- Keely?
You rock.

24:36.166 --> 24:37.416
- I knew you d
find something great.

24:37.417 --> 24:39.582
- It s what I do.

24:39.583 --> 24:42.749
Well, all that s left for us
to do then is,

24:42.750 --> 24:44.416
meet with the caterers.

24:44.417 --> 24:46.249
And we need to book a DJ.

24:46.250 --> 24:48.541
And I m gonna need
your final invite list.

24:48.542 --> 24:50.457
- This is gonna be the best
birthday ever.

24:50.458 --> 24:51.458
- Yeah, man.

24:51.459 --> 24:52.541
- You did it.

24:52.542 --> 24:54.290
- Thanks, Vince.
- Thank you.

24:54.291 --> 24:56.457
- Let s go eat, my friend.

24:59.792 --> 25:02.416
I can t believe I let you
talk me into this.

25:02.417 --> 25:04.249
- My money s on Veronica.

25:04.250 --> 25:05.290
- I need a break.

25:05.291 --> 25:06.291
- Water.

25:06.292 --> 25:07.416
- Here you go.

25:07.417 --> 25:10.332
- You got a good workout.

25:10.333 --> 25:11.333
- How s the ride along going?

25:11.334 --> 25:12.541
- Fantastic.

25:12.542 --> 25:13.874
- And the girl?

25:13.875 --> 25:16.666
- We re going on a date
tomorrow night.

25:16.667 --> 25:19.582
What?
What... what s that look for?

25:19.583 --> 25:21.249
- Jeff, you know I love you.

25:21.250 --> 25:22.582
But if you re doing
this because you

25:22.583 --> 25:25.374
want the challenge,
or because your ego

25:25.375 --> 25:26.666
can t handle the rejection...

25:26.667 --> 25:29.249
- What? No.

25:29.250 --> 25:33.207
I... I mean, maybe at first
it was a bit about that, but...

25:33.208 --> 25:35.368
- Just make sure you re doing it
for the right reasons.

25:38.333 --> 25:39.624
- Okay.

25:39.625 --> 25:42.249
All right.

25:42.250 --> 25:43.583
- Let s get juice.

25:46.542 --> 25:47.999
- Why did you agree
to go to dinner?

25:48.000 --> 25:49.708
- He caught me off guard.

25:49.709 --> 25:51.082
I said yes
before I had a chance to

25:51.083 --> 25:55.040
really think it through
properly.

25:55.041 --> 25:57.041
- You look like you re
going to a business meeting.

25:59.458 --> 26:01.958
- You know what?
I m just going to text him

26:01.959 --> 26:03.124
and I m going to cancel

26:03.125 --> 26:04.457
and I ll say that I m unwell.

26:04.458 --> 26:06.833
- You should go,
but not in that outfit.

26:06.834 --> 26:08.165
He probably already
made reservations

26:08.166 --> 26:10.165
and it would be
rude to cancel now.

26:10.166 --> 26:11.083
- I hate it when you re right.

26:11.084 --> 26:12.332
- It s just dinner.

26:12.333 --> 26:15.833
It s not like
you re marrying the guy.

26:15.834 --> 26:17.194
- Is there something else
going on?

26:21.834 --> 26:24.916
- Vince has been
acting strange lately.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.749
He s working all the time,

26:27.750 --> 26:29.834
but when I called his office,
he was out for the day.

26:33.583 --> 26:35.916
Well, has he ever mentioned
someone named Keely?

26:35.917 --> 26:38.040
- No.

26:38.041 --> 26:39.165
Do you want me to cancel dinner?

26:39.166 --> 26:40.374
I can stay and talk.

26:40.375 --> 26:44.499
- No, no.
You re going on this date.

26:44.500 --> 26:48.040
Wear your blue dress.
It s gorgeous.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.125
- Wow.

27:08.792 --> 27:10.541
You look beautiful.

27:10.542 --> 27:12.541
- Thank you.

27:12.542 --> 27:13.874
- Jeff Alexander.

27:13.875 --> 27:16.374
So good to see you again.

27:16.375 --> 27:17.541
- Thank you.

27:17.542 --> 27:18.542
Allow me.

27:20.542 --> 27:23.124
- Thank you.

27:23.125 --> 27:25.207
- I m Harper.

27:25.208 --> 27:27.833
Anything else you need, Jeff,
just let me know.

27:27.834 --> 27:29.249
- Thank you, Harper.

27:29.250 --> 27:31.082
- Wow.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.083
- Looks amazing, doesn t it?

27:32.084 --> 27:34.416
- Looks expensive.

27:34.417 --> 27:36.999
- You know, it s my treat.
Anything you like.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.499
- Thanks.

27:38.500 --> 27:39.749
Right.

27:39.750 --> 27:41.000
- Well, you have to try...

27:57.834 --> 27:59.958
- One, he used to talk,
now he clams up.

27:59.959 --> 28:03.374
Two, he disappears for hours
to do a simple task.

28:03.375 --> 28:06.457
Three, he starts
working overtime.

28:06.458 --> 28:09.374
Four, he lies
or evades your questions.

28:09.375 --> 28:10.959
Five, he buys you guilt gifts.

28:16.709 --> 28:17.999
- Hey, babe.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.416
- Hey.

28:19.417 --> 28:21.416
- I m just wrapping up
here at work right now.

28:21.417 --> 28:23.624
This Tokyo account
is running me ragged.

28:23.625 --> 28:26.040
You want to grab a bite?

28:26.041 --> 28:28.040
- I already ate,
but you can come by my place.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.761
- Okay. All right, great.
I ll see you soon.

28:36.417 --> 28:37.958
- Alcott Elementary.

28:37.959 --> 28:39.290
First grade.

28:39.291 --> 28:41.165
Matt Smyth fell out of a tree
and broke his arm

28:41.166 --> 28:42.582
and he wouldn t stop crying.

28:42.583 --> 28:44.457
And there wasn t anything
I could do to help him.

28:44.458 --> 28:45.666
- No. Poor kid.

28:45.667 --> 28:47.916
- Well, I wanted to
be a doctor ever since.

28:47.917 --> 28:49.624
And I ve applied
to some med schools.

28:49.625 --> 28:51.916
LA Medical School
is my first choice.

28:51.917 --> 28:55.040
- My fingers
are crossed for you.

28:55.041 --> 28:57.582
- So do you enjoy
working as a philanthropist?

28:57.583 --> 29:01.499
- Sure. My philosophy is,
life is short so enjoy it.

29:01.500 --> 29:05.165
My job is to help people
enjoy their lives too.

29:05.166 --> 29:06.541
- I ve never heard
anyone describe

29:06.542 --> 29:08.332
philanthropy quite like that.

29:08.333 --> 29:09.999
- Well, a lot of people
obsess over the money.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.332
Money doesn t matter.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.499
- Only someone with money

29:12.500 --> 29:13.833
would say that
money doesn t matter.

29:13.834 --> 29:15.624
- Okay. Fair enough.

29:15.625 --> 29:17.124
It may make life easier,

29:17.125 --> 29:19.333
but money by itself
never made anyone happy.

29:23.208 --> 29:27.374
Doing what you do,
how do you not become

29:27.375 --> 29:29.958
emotionally attached
to every patient you treat?

29:29.959 --> 29:32.374
- Well, if I did,
I couldn t do my job.

29:32.375 --> 29:34.207
But for every paramedic,

29:34.208 --> 29:38.040
there s one or two cases
that stick with you.

29:38.041 --> 29:39.374
Where you wonder
what if the call

29:39.375 --> 29:40.666
had come in a minute earlier

29:40.667 --> 29:43.541
or there d been
a little less traffic.

29:43.542 --> 29:45.666
- It s much easier
to write a check.

29:45.667 --> 29:47.666
I never get to see the faces
of the people we help.

29:47.667 --> 29:51.416
This whole ride-along thing s
really,

29:51.417 --> 29:53.541
it s really opened my eyes.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.165
- I m glad.

29:55.166 --> 29:57.249
- I can t stop thinking about
Carter though.

29:57.250 --> 29:59.374
You know, I know what it s like
to have a sick parent.

29:59.375 --> 30:01.165
- Well, his mom s back home
and doing much better.

30:01.166 --> 30:03.249
- That s good.

30:03.250 --> 30:05.666
But I want to do something
for kids like Carter.

30:05.667 --> 30:08.165
An organization, a foundation,
something.

30:08.166 --> 30:09.708
- That would be wonderful.

30:09.709 --> 30:10.542
- You think so?

30:10.542 --> 30:11.542
- Absolutely.

30:13.417 --> 30:15.958
- So last piece.

30:15.959 --> 30:19.082
I ll, 
chopstick-battle you for it.

30:19.083 --> 30:20.083
- Okay.

30:22.417 --> 30:23.791
- Ready?

30:23.792 --> 30:24.792
- Three, two...

30:24.793 --> 30:26.457
One, go.

30:26.458 --> 30:27.458
Careful....

30:27.459 --> 30:29.040
- Ha!

30:29.041 --> 30:31.958
- Organic, non-GMO
air-popped popcorn

30:31.959 --> 30:33.375
seasoned with herbs.

30:34.959 --> 30:38.249
- Veronica.
You re a gem.

30:38.250 --> 30:40.290
Tonight s your night
to choose.

30:44.291 --> 30:45.791
What do you think about
Lilly and Jeff?

30:45.792 --> 30:48.207
- I think
she ll be good for him.

30:48.208 --> 30:52.416
- I hope so.
But it s only the first date.

30:52.417 --> 30:56.041
- Well, sometimes when you know,
you know.

31:13.417 --> 31:16.666
- Hey, babe.
These are for you.

31:16.667 --> 31:17.667
- Number five.

31:17.668 --> 31:18.874
- Pardon?

31:18.875 --> 31:20.666
- They re lovely.
Thank you.

31:20.667 --> 31:21.874
What s the occasion?

31:21.875 --> 31:23.165
- Does a guy need a reason

31:23.166 --> 31:24.457
to buy his girlfriend flowers?

31:24.458 --> 31:25.750
- You tell me.

31:28.458 --> 31:32.457
- Look, I feel guilty.

31:32.458 --> 31:36.040
I ve just been working
such long hours.

31:36.041 --> 31:37.416
- Called your office yesterday.

31:37.417 --> 31:39.124
- Yeah?

31:39.125 --> 31:40.999
- I thought you said you d
be in meetings all day,

31:41.000 --> 31:42.916
but your assistant said you were
gone for the afternoon.

31:42.917 --> 31:46.207
- You know, I had a couple,
meetings off-site.

31:46.208 --> 31:48.374
That s unusual for you.

31:48.375 --> 31:52.124
- Tokyo guys wanted to see the
town, so I took them on a tour.

31:52.125 --> 31:54.165
You want your coffee?

31:54.166 --> 31:57.249
- So who s working
on the Tokyo account?

31:57.250 --> 31:59.125
- Ben, Aaron, Jackie, Brad.

32:01.333 --> 32:03.999
Is everything okay?

32:04.000 --> 32:05.874
- Why wouldn t it be?

32:05.875 --> 32:08.249
- I don t know.

32:08.250 --> 32:11.916
- I m fine.

32:11.917 --> 32:13.165
We re fine, right?

32:13.166 --> 32:15.000
- Yes.
Of course we are.

32:18.417 --> 32:21.208
Come here.

32:24.709 --> 32:27.082
- Thank you. That was the most
amazing meal I ve ever had.

32:27.083 --> 32:30.874
- That was the most amazing
chopstick battle I ve ever had.

32:30.875 --> 32:31.875
I had a lot of fun.

32:31.876 --> 32:32.959
- So did I.

32:34.542 --> 32:35.958
- Jeffrey.

32:35.959 --> 32:36.875
Crystal.

32:36.876 --> 32:38.708
- Okay.

32:38.709 --> 32:41.124
Um, Crystal, this is Lilly.

32:41.125 --> 32:44.040
- Hi.
Nice to meet you.

32:44.041 --> 32:45.874
- Lilly s been kind enough
to put up with me

32:45.875 --> 32:47.541
at the medical center this week.

32:47.542 --> 32:49.290
- You re one of
his charity projects.

32:49.291 --> 32:50.582
- How lovely.
- Actually...

32:50.583 --> 32:52.416
- Jeffrey, we missed your
gorgeous face

32:52.417 --> 32:54.416
at the polo match
for muscular dystrophy.

32:54.417 --> 32:57.207
- I had a previous obligation.
How d it go?

32:57.208 --> 32:59.541
- We raised 500.
I was hoping for 700.

32:59.542 --> 33:01.541
Promise me that
you won t miss my gala?

33:01.542 --> 33:02.999
- Remind me?

33:03.000 --> 33:05.833
- We re raising money for CDH.

33:05.834 --> 33:07.165
Where s your phone?

33:07.166 --> 33:10.249
- Crystal... hey.

33:10.250 --> 33:11.666
I m so sorry.

33:11.667 --> 33:13.082
Crystal, my phone, please?

33:13.083 --> 33:15.165
Crystal, this is not okay.

33:15.166 --> 33:16.916
- There.
Now you can t forget.

33:16.917 --> 33:18.542
- What are you doing?

33:24.500 --> 33:26.666
- Wow.

33:26.667 --> 33:28.374
What is that outfit?

33:28.375 --> 33:30.333
- I m trying out a new look.

33:32.875 --> 33:34.666
I m pretty sure
Vince is cheating on me.

33:34.667 --> 33:37.582
- Vince?
I don t believe it, no.

33:37.583 --> 33:39.708
- I know him well enough
to know when he s lying.

33:39.709 --> 33:42.082
And he was lying about where
he was and who he was with.

33:42.083 --> 33:44.457
- Okay, that doesn t mean
he s cheating though.

33:44.458 --> 33:48.040
You don t know that.

33:48.041 --> 33:49.541
- I m pretty sure
her name is Keely,

33:49.542 --> 33:52.416
and she s probably 22
and does hot yoga

33:52.417 --> 33:54.457
and drinks kale smoothies.

33:54.458 --> 33:56.541
- Have you talked to Vince
about this yet?

33:56.542 --> 33:58.375
- No, I m not ready for that.

33:59.959 --> 34:01.708
What about you?
How was your date?

34:01.709 --> 34:03.249
- It was fine,

34:03.250 --> 34:06.541
but Jeff lives
in this complete other world.

34:06.542 --> 34:10.833
And I don t want to
be a part of it.

34:10.833 --> 34:12.748
I want to just focus on
getting into med school

34:12.750 --> 34:13.750
and that s it.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.081
- You know,
I can always give you

34:29.083 --> 34:31.165
a list of what else we d like,

34:31.166 --> 34:33.165
you know,
if you re gonna provide.

34:33.166 --> 34:35.456
- And what is going on here?
- Perfect. Thank you.

34:35.458 --> 34:39.708
Well, Jeff has
catered breakfast for us.

34:40.875 --> 34:42.916
- That s awfully kind of him.

34:42.917 --> 34:45.165
- I couldn t take another day
of Nick s microwaved eggs.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.541
Gourmet as they were.

34:47.542 --> 34:49.581
- I m gonna bring my famous
cold spaghetti pie.

34:49.583 --> 34:52.081
That ought to get us
a steak dinner, you ll see.

34:52.083 --> 34:53.666
- Dr. Richwood to the ER.

34:53.667 --> 34:55.040
- Nick, come with me.
Will you take that?

34:55.041 --> 34:56.666
- What are the sirens for?

34:56.667 --> 34:58.290
- Multiple car crash coming in.

34:58.291 --> 35:00.124
- Yikes.

35:00.125 --> 35:01.624
- Lot of people
texting and driving these days,

35:01.625 --> 35:03.290
and not just kids.

35:03.291 --> 35:05.791
- Yeah.

35:05.792 --> 35:07.666
Hey, listen, I...

35:07.667 --> 35:11.749
I had a really great time
the other night.

35:11.750 --> 35:15.416
I was hoping that maybe
we could, tr...

35:15.417 --> 35:19.666
- Welfare call. Code 2.
70s female.

35:19.667 --> 35:21.582
- What... what s a code 2?

35:21.583 --> 35:25.165
- An elderly woman hasn t been
heard from in two days.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.207
- On scene, over.

35:43.834 --> 35:45.999
- Thanks.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.916
You go that way.
Hello!

35:47.917 --> 35:48.958

35:48.959 --> 35:49.959

35:54.750 --> 35:56.582
- Hello?

35:56.583 --> 35:57.916
- Is anyone here?

35:57.917 --> 35:59.082
- Ma am, are you home?

35:59.083 --> 36:00.363
- Ma am, we re here to help you.

36:03.417 --> 36:05.917
- Hello?

36:08.291 --> 36:11.290
Is anyone here?
LA County Sheriff.

36:11.291 --> 36:12.416
- Lilly.

36:12.417 --> 36:13.999
- Did you find her?

36:14.000 --> 36:15.917
- No, but I found this.

36:24.875 --> 36:26.457
- This is Charlie 8-12.

36:26.458 --> 36:29.666
70s female has gone on vacation

36:29.667 --> 36:32.999
70s female

36:33.000 --> 36:35.541
She ll be returning March 25th.
Over.

36:35.542 --> 36:37.082
- So this woman is safe

36:37.083 --> 36:39.249
and happily traveling
through Canada.

36:39.250 --> 36:40.457
- Apparently.

36:40.458 --> 36:41.750
- Ha, great.
- We re all good.

36:43.166 --> 36:44.958
- So, 
you get many false alarms?

36:44.959 --> 36:46.624
- A few.

36:46.625 --> 36:47.791
I d rather have
a false alarm than a fatality.

36:54.875 --> 36:57.833
- Good morning.

36:57.834 --> 36:58.874
Hey, good morning.

36:58.875 --> 37:00.124
- Hi.

37:00.125 --> 37:01.290

37:08.375 --> 37:09.624
Your 11:00 a.m. is here.

37:09.625 --> 37:11.958

37:11.959 --> 37:13.499
- Come on in.
Have a seat.

37:13.500 --> 37:14.708
- Thank you.

37:14.709 --> 37:16.499
- Thank you for coming.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.165
- Well, if the client
is too busy

37:18.166 --> 37:19.332
to come to the caterer,

37:19.333 --> 37:21.999
the caterer comes to the client.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.749
- Yes.
- Voilà.

37:23.750 --> 37:25.666
- Megan loves chocolate.

37:25.667 --> 37:27.999
- I have all the chocolate
choices for her.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.582
Let me see.

37:29.583 --> 37:32.499
Let s start with, we have
a Belgian milk chocolate.

37:32.500 --> 37:36.374
A fudgy chocolate with ganache,
my personal fave, yes.

37:36.375 --> 37:38.708
And a raspberry-filled
dark chocolate.

37:38.709 --> 37:42.249
And, lastly, a coconut chocolate
with cream cheese.

37:42.250 --> 37:43.332
- I m glad I skipped lunch.

37:43.333 --> 37:44.499
- Yeah.

37:44.500 --> 37:45.500
- Did you bring the milk?

37:45.501 --> 37:46.582
- Did I bring the milk?

37:46.583 --> 37:48.082
- Yes.

37:48.083 --> 37:50.541
- What s in my bag of tricks
over here?

37:50.542 --> 37:51.749
Milk.

37:53.667 --> 37:56.082
- Okay.
I m not even gonna go there.

37:56.083 --> 37:57.374
- It was on sale!

37:57.375 --> 37:58.541
- Yeah. Knowing you...

37:58.542 --> 38:00.499
- Bang for my buck.
Let me get you a fork.

38:00.500 --> 38:02.374
Hold on, let me see.

38:02.375 --> 38:04.124
Okay. Here we go.

38:04.125 --> 38:05.374
- Thank you.

38:05.375 --> 38:06.375
All right, let s see.

38:11.125 --> 38:12.125
Okay.

38:12.126 --> 38:13.541
That s the one.

38:14.625 --> 38:15.999
- That s the one, right there.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.999
- All my clients die

38:18.000 --> 38:19.541

38:19.542 --> 38:20.999

He s in a meeting right now.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.541
You can t go in.
Sorry, doll.

38:24.208 --> 38:25.708
- Yes!
- Yeah.

38:25.709 --> 38:26.999
- What s going on in there?

38:27.000 --> 38:28.374
- Just a meeting.

38:28.375 --> 38:29.541
- Just melts in your mouth.

38:29.542 --> 38:30.542
- Yes.

38:30.543 --> 38:32.332
- Yeah.

38:32.333 --> 38:34.499
- With whom is he meeting?

38:34.500 --> 38:37.040
- She s not a work client.
Her name is Kelly, Kylie...

38:37.041 --> 38:38.416
- Keely?
- That s it.

38:38.417 --> 38:39.916
- That s it.
That s the best.

38:39.917 --> 38:41.749
That is the best right there.

38:44.166 --> 38:45.207
- Yes!

38:45.208 --> 38:46.208
- Yeah?

38:48.417 --> 38:49.537
- Don t tell him I was here.

39:01.792 --> 39:02.999
- Nice form, Pops.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.082
What do you call that move?

39:04.083 --> 39:05.708
Lunge curl.

39:05.709 --> 39:07.416
- What do you got there?

39:07.417 --> 39:09.457
- It s Veronica s vanilla
milkshake. You want some?

39:09.458 --> 39:11.833
- Keep that away from me.

39:11.834 --> 39:14.874
How s everything
at the medical center?

39:14.875 --> 39:16.374
- Intense.

39:16.375 --> 39:18.374
I don t know how
they do what they do every day.

39:18.375 --> 39:19.582
- It s a special calling.

39:19.583 --> 39:20.874
- Yeah.

39:20.875 --> 39:22.624
- How s Lilly?

39:22.625 --> 39:24.708
- You know,
I just can t figure her out.

39:24.709 --> 39:25.999
She s impossible to read.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.833
- Son,

39:27.834 --> 39:31.290
I m gonna tell you the secret
to understanding women.

39:31.291 --> 39:32.916
Listen.

39:32.917 --> 39:34.290
- Okay. I m listening.
What is it?

39:34.291 --> 39:35.749
- No, no, no, no, no.
That s the secret.

39:35.750 --> 39:37.749
A woman will tell you
everything you need to know

39:37.750 --> 39:39.333
if you just listen.

39:42.500 --> 39:43.709
- Ha.

39:47.333 --> 39:48.500
- Morning, Doc.

39:51.458 --> 39:53.416
- 380, copy.

39:53.417 --> 39:54.874
- Copy.

39:59.500 --> 40:01.165
- I can t believe
you re still awake.

40:01.166 --> 40:03.124
- Well, we introduced
solid foods this week

40:03.125 --> 40:05.457
and Everett started
sleeping through the night.

40:05.458 --> 40:07.332
Which happily means
Mommy and Daddy

40:07.333 --> 40:10.582
started sleeping
through the night.

40:10.583 --> 40:11.875
- En passant.

40:13.667 --> 40:14.667
- What was that?

40:14.667 --> 40:15.667
- Look it up.

40:15.667 --> 40:16.667
- Nick hates to lose.

40:16.668 --> 40:18.833
- I do not.

40:18.834 --> 40:20.791
En passant?

40:21.917 --> 40:23.666
- It s ridiculous.

40:23.667 --> 40:26.249
- I got an email from
the Los Angeles Medical School.

40:26.250 --> 40:30.249
"Dear Lilly Springler...
Inform..."

40:30.250 --> 40:31.999
Wait-listed.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.374
Again.

40:33.375 --> 40:34.999
- Means you still have a chance.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.290
- Yeah, if a buy a new wing
for the hospital.

40:37.291 --> 40:39.749
I... I can t keep doing this.

40:39.750 --> 40:40.833
- Doing what?

40:40.834 --> 40:42.249
- Getting so close to my dream

40:42.250 --> 40:43.970
and then having the door
slammed in my face.

40:49.041 --> 40:50.499
- Charlie 812, pediatric trauma.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.124
1915 North Tamara Avenue.

40:52.125 --> 40:53.792
Support. LAFD on scene.

41:15.166 --> 41:16.874
- Asthma is difficult
to deal with,

41:16.875 --> 41:18.833
but your brother s
gonna be okay.

41:18.834 --> 41:20.874
- Lilly wouldn t tell you that
if it wasn t true.

41:20.875 --> 41:22.290
- That s right.

41:22.291 --> 41:23.874
- I ll go with them.

41:23.875 --> 41:25.374
- I will stay here, and I will
take care of the paperwork.

41:25.375 --> 41:28.082
- I hate paperwork.
She s the best.

41:28.083 --> 41:29.791
- Yeah, so I m learning.

41:29.792 --> 41:31.582
- Got a knack with kids.

41:31.583 --> 41:33.082
- Well, that s because I am one.

41:33.083 --> 41:35.290
- I can see that.

41:35.291 --> 41:38.082
- When was the last time
you were on vacation?

41:38.083 --> 41:40.249
- Um.

41:40.250 --> 41:41.624
I can t remember.

41:41.625 --> 41:43.624
- Or had fun?

41:43.625 --> 41:45.916
- Does the cardiac
science symposium count?

41:45.917 --> 41:47.708
- No, definitely not.

41:51.083 --> 41:54.082
- Saw you re off Saturday.
Any plans?

41:54.083 --> 41:56.457
- Laundry. Errands.
Loads of fun.

41:56.458 --> 41:57.916
- Good; get your errands
done early,

41:57.917 --> 42:00.999
cause I m picking you up
at noon.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.749
- What for?

42:02.750 --> 42:03.750
- You ll see.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.542
Trust me.

42:20.917 --> 42:22.750
- What do you think?

42:24.166 --> 42:26.624
- Ixnay on the sneakers.

42:26.625 --> 42:28.082
- Jeff won t tell me
where we re going.

42:28.083 --> 42:29.083
I want to be comfortable.

42:35.041 --> 42:37.332
Is that Vince?

42:37.333 --> 42:40.124
You know you re gonna have to
talk to him eventually.

42:40.125 --> 42:42.792
- I know.
I just can t right now.

42:44.208 --> 42:46.124
- Are you gonna be all right?

42:46.125 --> 42:48.207
- I m sorry to be such a bummer,

42:48.208 --> 42:52.000
but this is not the way
my life was supposed to go.

42:53.917 --> 42:56.582
By 30, I was supposed to be
a professor,

42:56.583 --> 42:59.457
not a single substitute teacher
living with a roommate.

42:59.458 --> 43:02.207
No offense.

43:02.208 --> 43:05.416
- Peoples lives don t turn out
the way they planned.

43:05.417 --> 43:08.040
But you have family and friends
who love you.

43:08.041 --> 43:12.082
And you have plenty of time to
achieve all of your dreams...

43:12.083 --> 43:14.709
with or without Vince.

43:17.208 --> 43:19.834
- Thanks, Lil.

43:21.250 --> 43:22.250
- Okay.
I can t leave you here.

43:22.251 --> 43:23.666
Come with us. Come.

43:23.667 --> 43:26.499
- No. No,
I m just gonna lie here

43:26.500 --> 43:28.040
and contemplate
my wasted existence.

43:30.291 --> 43:32.582
- I ll be fine.
Just go.

43:32.583 --> 43:35.457
I m gonna be mad
if you don t go and have fun.

43:35.458 --> 43:36.458
- Okay.

43:46.709 --> 43:48.040
- Wow.

43:48.041 --> 43:51.749
You look beautiful, as always.

43:51.750 --> 43:52.750
- Thanks.

43:55.542 --> 43:57.290
- Promise not to have me towed?

43:57.291 --> 43:58.874
- If you park in the right spot,

43:58.875 --> 43:59.625
I won t have to.

44:07.834 --> 44:09.999
You know,
you were my inspiration

44:10.000 --> 44:11.165
for this whole thing.

44:11.166 --> 44:13.416
- What thing?

44:13.417 --> 44:15.999
Jeff, what is it?

44:16.000 --> 44:20.165
- Watching you at work,
you inspired me to want to be

44:20.166 --> 44:22.582
more involved
with the people we help.

44:22.583 --> 44:26.999
So you are standing on
the new Rex Alexander Kid Camp.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.874
- That s wonderful!

44:29.875 --> 44:31.249
- I mean, when my mom got sick,

44:31.250 --> 44:34.499
I had a hard time
dealing with the sadness.

44:34.500 --> 44:36.999
My dad sent me to Camp Calston
for the week.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.374
At first I didn t want to go,

44:38.375 --> 44:41.499
but then I ended up
having the time of my life.

44:41.500 --> 44:44.666
We swam in the lake.
We camped out under the stars.

44:44.667 --> 44:46.582
Played games.

44:46.583 --> 44:47.916
My counselor
helped me understand

44:47.917 --> 44:49.582
that it was okay
to feel sad about my mom

44:49.583 --> 44:51.708
and still have fun
with the other kids,

44:51.709 --> 44:55.040
that I wasn t alone.

44:55.041 --> 44:56.874
- You were just a boy
when you went through all this.

44:58.291 --> 44:59.958
I want this place to be for kids

44:59.959 --> 45:02.040
what Camp Calston was for me.

45:02.041 --> 45:04.457
You know, a place for them
to process their grief

45:04.458 --> 45:08.374
and do what kids should be
doing, having fun.

45:08.375 --> 45:09.499
- Well, I m really proud of you.

45:09.500 --> 45:14.082
And it does fit
your personal philosophy,

45:14.083 --> 45:16.999
helping people
enjoy their lives.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
- You remembered.

45:20.625 --> 45:21.825
I want you to be a part of it.

45:23.208 --> 45:25.249
- I want to be a part of it too.

45:25.250 --> 45:28.082
- Well, everyone has to
bring something to the table.

45:28.083 --> 45:30.541
What do you got?

45:30.542 --> 45:32.249
I can teach first aid.

45:32.250 --> 45:33.708
- Knowledge empowers kids.

45:33.709 --> 45:35.582
It reduces their stress
to have an action plan

45:35.583 --> 45:36.542
in case of an emergency.

45:36.543 --> 45:37.874
- Amazing.

45:37.875 --> 45:39.374
Anything else?

45:39.375 --> 45:41.124
- I can make a mean s more.

45:41.125 --> 45:42.541
- Now we are talking.
You are hired.

45:59.458 --> 46:00.708
- Megan, I don t know
what s going on,

46:00.709 --> 46:04.291
but it would be great
if you would just call me back.

46:05.792 --> 46:06.792
I love you.

46:11.125 --> 46:13.624
- Thank you. Hey.

46:13.625 --> 46:15.916
Sorry I m a few minutes late.

46:15.917 --> 46:17.582
- Fine.
Have a seat.

46:17.583 --> 46:19.082
- You okay?

46:19.083 --> 46:20.666
- My girlfriend, Megan,

46:20.667 --> 46:23.332
is having a tough time
with this birthday.

46:23.333 --> 46:25.499
- Well, 30 is different
for everyone, Vince.

46:25.500 --> 46:27.499
- I don t know why.
It was fine for me.

46:27.500 --> 46:28.541
It s just another number.

46:28.542 --> 46:29.708
Look. Hey.

46:29.709 --> 46:31.582
Maybe it s not about the number,

46:31.583 --> 46:35.040
but what it means to her
as a woman.

46:35.041 --> 46:36.499
- What do you mean?

46:36.500 --> 46:39.040
- Okay, well, some people have

46:39.041 --> 46:41.165
certain expectations
for themselves,

46:41.166 --> 46:42.207
personally and
professionally, right?

46:42.208 --> 46:43.749
- Of course.
- Well,

46:43.750 --> 46:45.916
if those things haven t
been reached by a certain age,

46:45.917 --> 46:47.666
it triggers a crises.

46:47.667 --> 46:48.874
- Look at you.

46:48.875 --> 46:50.040
Do you like that?

46:50.041 --> 46:52.541
- Dropping gems.

46:52.542 --> 46:54.541
- Yeah, I guess I never
thought about it that way.

46:54.542 --> 46:56.749
- Yeah.
I majored in psychology.

46:56.750 --> 46:58.624
Don t ask how that led to
a career in party planning.

47:00.083 --> 47:02.374
- Something went wrong.

47:02.375 --> 47:03.749
- I think throwing her
this birthday party

47:03.750 --> 47:05.916
will probably be the best thing
to do to cheer her up.

47:05.917 --> 47:07.207
- Okay.
Let s go over the final details.

47:07.208 --> 47:08.249
- All right.
Let s do it.

47:08.250 --> 47:09.000
- So we got the place
you wanted.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
- All right.

47:10.001 --> 47:11.666
- And if we don t hit any snags,

47:11.667 --> 47:13.416
I think we ll be up and running
by early next year.

47:13.417 --> 47:15.040
But enough about all that.

47:15.041 --> 47:16.416
I ve got something for you.

47:18.375 --> 47:19.749
- Jeff, what s this?

47:19.750 --> 47:20.750
- You ll see.

47:22.417 --> 47:23.958
Close your eyes.

47:23.959 --> 47:25.374
No peeking.

47:29.583 --> 47:30.917
Ready?

47:34.417 --> 47:35.417
- Jeff!

47:43.959 --> 47:47.457
- I made these myself.

47:48.459 --> 47:50.124
Veronica was
a little concerned about

47:50.125 --> 47:51.541
you eating my cooking though.

47:51.542 --> 47:53.958
- Well, I ll go with PB&J
just to be safe.

47:56.250 --> 47:57.541
They re delicious.

47:57.542 --> 47:58.542
- Success.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.791
I could tell this
medical school thing was

48:03.792 --> 48:05.791
stressing you out so I wanted to
take you somewhere

48:05.792 --> 48:06.958
where you d relax.

48:06.959 --> 48:10.457
- That s really thoughtful.

48:10.458 --> 48:14.542
- I propose a toast.

48:18.041 --> 48:21.999
A toast to enjoying life.

48:26.667 --> 48:28.833
You know,
it s true what they say.

48:28.834 --> 48:30.959
The best things in life,
you can t buy.

48:34.834 --> 48:36.582
- I think I owe you an apology.

48:39.166 --> 48:42.040
- I m trained to
quickly assess a situation

48:42.041 --> 48:43.541
and make an accurate
snap judgment.

48:43.542 --> 48:44.708
Lives depend on it.

48:44.709 --> 48:49.249
But I may have judged you
too soon.

48:49.250 --> 48:50.416
- How so?

48:50.417 --> 48:52.541
- Well, I just thought
you were some

48:52.542 --> 48:55.249
rich, entitled,
spoiled, shallow brat

48:55.250 --> 48:56.332
who just bought his
way through life.

48:56.333 --> 48:57.666
- Any more adjectives?

48:58.668 --> 49:01.833
No, I m serious.

49:01.834 --> 49:04.791
I thought
you were just coasting,

49:04.792 --> 49:06.290
without...

49:06.291 --> 49:08.291
Without care or regard
for anyone else.

49:10.542 --> 49:11.833
- Please, don t sugarcoat
on my account.

49:13.500 --> 49:16.374
Now that I ve
spent some time with you,

49:16.375 --> 49:19.541
I can admit that I was wrong.

49:19.542 --> 49:21.457
- Well, maybe not entirely.

49:21.458 --> 49:24.207
Before I met you,

49:24.208 --> 49:26.833
I was coasting, in a way.

49:26.834 --> 49:29.040
You made me
really look at myself.

49:29.041 --> 49:30.601
What I wanted to do,
who I wanted to be.

49:33.041 --> 49:34.917
And it turns out
it s helping kids.

49:47.375 --> 49:49.082
- Thank you for today.

49:49.083 --> 49:50.208
- My pleasure.

49:51.875 --> 49:53.916
- Well, I ll see you
at the med center tomorrow then.

49:53.917 --> 49:55.082
- I meant to tell you.

49:55.083 --> 49:57.165
Rex has meetings
all next week in London.

49:57.166 --> 49:58.874
And I m traveling with him.

49:58.875 --> 50:00.249
- London?
Nice.

50:00.250 --> 50:02.374
- You know, foundation business.

50:02.375 --> 50:04.499
- Well, enjoy.

50:04.500 --> 50:06.999
- I, I don t know
if you remember

50:07.000 --> 50:08.582
what Crystal said
about the CDH gala.

50:08.583 --> 50:09.583
- I remember.

50:11.250 --> 50:13.666
- I was...

50:13.667 --> 50:15.333
wondering if you d
be interested in going.

50:18.875 --> 50:20.667
- Are you sure
Crystal wouldn t mind?

50:26.458 --> 50:27.875
- I don t mind if she does mind.

50:31.792 --> 50:33.000
What do you think?

50:35.875 --> 50:37.000
- I d like that.

50:39.250 --> 50:40.250
- Me too.

50:50.417 --> 50:51.417
Good night.

50:51.417 --> 50:52.417
- Good night.

51:01.625 --> 51:03.791
- How did it go?

51:03.792 --> 51:06.040
- Good.

51:06.041 --> 51:07.041
And what about you,

51:07.042 --> 51:08.582
are you feeling a little better?

51:08.583 --> 51:10.374
- A little.

51:10.375 --> 51:11.708
But you re right.

51:11.709 --> 51:13.874
I still have plenty of time
to achieve my goals.

51:13.875 --> 51:15.457
And I m not getting
any closer to my dreams

51:15.458 --> 51:18.457
by moping around
or by putting on wrinkle cream.

51:18.458 --> 51:20.040
- That s the spirit.

51:20.041 --> 51:21.124
And what are you working on?

51:21.125 --> 51:23.374
- Grad school applications.

51:23.375 --> 51:25.833
- Megan, that s wonderful.

51:25.834 --> 51:27.666
- Thank you for being
such a good friend.

51:27.667 --> 51:29.290
And for putting up
with my craziness.

51:29.291 --> 51:31.165
- I wouldn t trade your
craziness for anything.

51:41.667 --> 51:44.040
- So, Jeff, tell me about
this new charity of yours.

51:44.041 --> 51:45.874
- It s a camp for kids

51:45.875 --> 51:48.249
dealing with chronic illnesses
within their families.

51:48.250 --> 51:50.499
They do typical camp things
with the added benefit

51:50.500 --> 51:51.749
of having peers
they can relate to.

51:51.750 --> 51:54.708
Like, one I wish I had
when I was a kid.

51:54.709 --> 51:56.207
- I love it.

51:56.208 --> 51:57.457
I m proud of you, son.

51:57.458 --> 51:59.708
Founding your first charity.

51:59.709 --> 52:01.582
Your mom would be proud too.

52:01.583 --> 52:02.959
- Thanks, Dad.

52:10.208 --> 52:11.708
- When that ambulance
came for me,

52:11.709 --> 52:14.374
I remembered how short life is.

52:14.375 --> 52:17.999
And how important it is
to let the people you love know

52:18.000 --> 52:20.499
how much you care about them.

52:20.500 --> 52:23.999
Cause one day
it just might be too late.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.416
I love you, Jeff.

52:26.417 --> 52:28.874
- I love you too.

52:28.875 --> 52:29.875
- I say we go party.

52:29.876 --> 52:32.040
- Jeffrey!

52:32.041 --> 52:32.750
Hi.

52:32.750 --> 52:33.750
- Crystal.

52:33.751 --> 52:35.040
- Thought that was you.

52:35.041 --> 52:36.750
- Hey.
- Hi.

52:38.417 --> 52:39.958
- Crystal,
you remember my dad, Rex?

52:39.959 --> 52:42.082
- Of course.
Lovely to see you again, Rex.

52:42.083 --> 52:43.083
- Always a pleasure, Crystal.

52:43.084 --> 52:44.874
- What are you doing in London?

52:44.875 --> 52:46.958
- Calandre here is starring in a
fashion show tomorrow evening.

52:46.959 --> 52:48.916
- Pleasure.

52:48.917 --> 52:51.207
- Jeffrey is the philanthropist
I ve been telling you about.

52:51.208 --> 52:52.249
Brilliant.

52:52.250 --> 52:53.416
You should come to the show.

52:53.417 --> 52:55.749
- I don t know.
I think we have some...

52:55.750 --> 52:57.708
Don t we have some business
we have to account for...

52:57.709 --> 52:59.749
- Our last meeting s
at 4:00.

52:59.750 --> 53:00.750
- Then it s settled.

53:02.834 --> 53:03.916
- All right.

53:04.959 --> 53:06.207
We were you guys headed?

53:06.208 --> 53:07.208
Boy.

53:07.208 --> 53:08.208
- They re everywhere.

53:11.083 --> 53:14.249
- From now on,
wear a helmet, dude.

53:14.250 --> 53:15.333
Okay?

53:19.375 --> 53:21.749
- How many times
do we have to tell these kids

53:21.750 --> 53:23.874
that it s more cool
to wear a helmet

53:23.875 --> 53:25.290
than to end up in here?

53:25.291 --> 53:27.708
- They still don t listen.
- Yeah.

53:27.709 --> 53:29.666
- Everett s never leaving
the house without a helmet.

53:29.667 --> 53:31.791
And a full-armored body suit.

53:31.792 --> 53:34.249
Where s our
philanthropist today?

53:34.250 --> 53:35.250
- London.

53:37.125 --> 53:39.332
- You can say it s none of my
business, but you re like my

53:39.333 --> 53:40.624
sister and I don t want to
see you...

53:40.625 --> 53:41.791
- Okay. What is it?

53:41.792 --> 53:43.040
- Be careful.

53:43.041 --> 53:44.791
- Thought you liked Jeff?

53:44.792 --> 53:46.999
- I do, but he lives in
an entirely different world.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.499
And I don t want to see you
get hurt.

53:48.500 --> 53:51.082
- Jeff is far more down-to-earth
than he seems.

53:51.083 --> 53:52.207
- Hope you re right.

53:52.208 --> 53:53.708
- Look, I appreciate
your concern,

53:53.709 --> 53:55.124
but I know what I m doing.

53:55.125 --> 53:57.708
- Okay.
But if he hurts you?

53:57.709 --> 53:59.082
He s gonna go
for an ambulance ride

53:59.083 --> 54:01.582
and not in the jump seat.

54:01.583 --> 54:04.833
- Okay, deal.

54:04.834 --> 54:07.833
- Megan, this silent treatment
is getting ridiculous.

54:07.834 --> 54:09.207
Would you please call me back?

54:09.208 --> 54:11.207
I need to talk to you.
It s important.

54:11.208 --> 54:12.999
I love you.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.999
- The Tokyo copies you wanted.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.416
Dude, are you okay?

54:16.417 --> 54:18.416
- Yeah, I m fine.

54:18.417 --> 54:21.040
- You sure?
You don t seem it.

54:21.041 --> 54:23.499
What s the problem?
Maybe I can help.

54:23.500 --> 54:25.040
- All right.

54:25.041 --> 54:26.165
Megan won t return my calls,

54:26.166 --> 54:27.666
and I don t know why.

54:27.667 --> 54:29.541
- She did seem quite distressed
last time I saw her.

54:29.542 --> 54:31.332
- When was that?

54:31.333 --> 54:33.666
- You were locked in this office
with that, Kelly, Kylie...

54:33.667 --> 54:36.124
- Keely?
- That s the one.

54:36.125 --> 54:37.541
She thinks
you re cheating, dude.

54:37.542 --> 54:40.457
- She thinks...
Finn, I would never.

54:40.458 --> 54:41.541
- I know, I know.

54:41.542 --> 54:42.916
- Thanks.
- Anytime, man.

54:42.917 --> 54:44.374
Hey, can I wrangle an invite

54:44.375 --> 54:46.708
to that birthday shindig
of yours?

54:46.709 --> 54:47.750
Guess not.

54:58.583 --> 54:59.583
- We re home!

55:01.709 --> 55:03.624
- Welcome back, boys!

55:03.625 --> 55:05.499
How was your trip?

55:05.500 --> 55:06.708
Boring.

55:06.709 --> 55:09.374
- Would have much rather
been here with you.

55:12.375 --> 55:13.709
I brought you
a little something.

55:17.667 --> 55:19.582
My favorite tea and biscuits.

55:19.583 --> 55:20.959
You remembered.

55:23.417 --> 55:24.417
Thank you.

55:27.917 --> 55:29.708
What about you, Mister,
are you happy to be back?

55:29.709 --> 55:31.040
- Yeah.

55:31.041 --> 55:32.874
I can t wait to see Lilly again.

55:32.875 --> 55:34.207
- You must really miss her.

55:34.208 --> 55:35.749
You should do something for her.

55:35.750 --> 55:38.916
Something that
only you could do for her.

55:38.917 --> 55:40.750
Something she wouldn t expect.

55:47.417 --> 55:49.249
- The patient had a pre-existing
heart condition.

55:49.250 --> 55:51.082
- Okay.

55:51.083 --> 55:53.582
Then it looks like
this is everything.

55:54.750 --> 55:55.999
- Sorry.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.833
- Yeah.
Go ahead, take it.

55:57.834 --> 55:58.834
- Thank you.

56:00.500 --> 56:01.624
- Ms. Springler?

56:01.625 --> 56:03.124
- Yes, this is
Lilly Springler.

56:03.125 --> 56:04.207
- You applied
to LA Medical School.

56:04.208 --> 56:05.208
- Yes?

56:05.208 --> 56:06.208
- You ve been accepted.

56:06.209 --> 56:07.499
Will we see you at orientation?

56:07.500 --> 56:08.500
- Yeah, yes, yes.

56:08.501 --> 56:09.582
- Look for an email soon.

56:09.583 --> 56:11.833
- Thank you.

56:11.834 --> 56:14.624
I got accepted
to the LA Medical School.

56:14.625 --> 56:17.582
Congratulations.

56:17.583 --> 56:18.750
- Thank you.

56:36.417 --> 56:38.207
- What s all this?

56:38.208 --> 56:39.208
- It s for you.

56:42.542 --> 56:44.040
- What?

56:44.041 --> 56:45.125
Rex.

56:48.250 --> 56:51.541
- Veronica,

56:51.542 --> 56:53.624
you ve been my friend,

56:53.625 --> 56:55.290
my rock,

56:55.291 --> 56:57.207
and my companion

56:57.208 --> 57:01.457
all these years.

57:01.458 --> 57:03.374
You ve loved me
like I was your own family.

57:03.375 --> 57:04.999
And it s taken me
all these years

57:05.000 --> 57:08.124
to realize you are my family.

57:08.125 --> 57:09.365
And I want to make it official.

57:14.834 --> 57:15.917
Veronica...

57:18.834 --> 57:21.417
I want you to know
how deeply I cherish you.

57:25.375 --> 57:26.375
Will you marry me?

57:29.667 --> 57:32.207
- Rex, I don t...

57:32.208 --> 57:33.999
I don t know what to say.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.333
- Say yes.

57:37.417 --> 57:38.709
- Yes.

57:39.875 --> 57:41.541
Yes, of course.

58:26.583 --> 58:27.709
Thank you.

58:37.166 --> 58:38.833
"Any med school
will be lucky to have you.

58:38.834 --> 58:40.207
"You re going to be
the best doctor.

58:40.208 --> 58:41.416
"Can t wait to see you.

58:41.417 --> 58:42.417
Love, Jeff."

58:43.834 --> 58:45.624
- What is that?

58:45.625 --> 58:47.666
Gift from Jeff?

58:47.667 --> 58:50.457
- It is a med school
survival kit.

58:50.458 --> 58:53.666
There s coffee, pens.

58:53.667 --> 58:54.958
Ooh, there s even a stethoscope.

58:54.959 --> 58:56.666
- That s so sweet.

58:56.667 --> 58:58.040
A congratulations gift?

58:58.041 --> 58:59.541
- Well, I haven t even
told him yet.

58:59.542 --> 59:01.374
I was going to tell him
at the gala today.

59:01.375 --> 59:02.791
- That s right,
that s today.

59:02.792 --> 59:04.457
What is the future doctor
wearing?

59:04.458 --> 59:05.791
- I m wearing my black dress
from graduation.

59:05.792 --> 59:07.958
- No. Absolutely not.

59:07.959 --> 59:09.999
- Well, I like that dress.
Why not?

59:10.000 --> 59:11.332
- So many reasons,
I can t even begin.

59:11.333 --> 59:12.541
- But...

59:12.542 --> 59:14.290
- Get your keys.
We re going shopping.

59:14.291 --> 59:15.291
- But it s cute.

59:21.959 --> 59:23.207
So what is this place?

59:23.208 --> 59:24.208
- It s a high-end thrift shop.

59:24.209 --> 59:26.290
They have amazing
designer dresses

59:26.291 --> 59:27.916
at affordable prices.

59:27.917 --> 59:29.541
- Well, what about
that bridesmaid s dress

59:29.542 --> 59:30.582
I wore to CC s wedding?

59:30.583 --> 59:32.249
- You might as well wear scrubs.

59:32.250 --> 59:33.332
No, you re not wearing scrubs.

59:33.333 --> 59:35.040
- All right, all right.

59:35.041 --> 59:37.441
- Come on, I m gonna make sure
you look like a million bucks.

59:41.834 --> 59:43.833
You look beautiful.

59:43.834 --> 59:44.999
But those shoes?

59:45.000 --> 59:47.416
No, no, and no.

59:47.417 --> 59:49.082
- What s wrong with my shoes?

59:49.083 --> 59:50.833
- What isn t wrong
with those shoes?

59:50.834 --> 59:51.874
- They re comfortable.

59:51.875 --> 59:54.082
Try these.

59:54.083 --> 59:56.332
- I m gonna fall flat on my face
in front of everyone in these.

59:56.333 --> 59:57.999
No, you re not, princess.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.833
Just walk slowly
and take small steps.

01:00:00.834 --> 01:00:02.332
- Thank you.
- You re welcome.

01:00:02.333 --> 01:00:03.500
That s what friends are for.

01:00:10.208 --> 01:00:11.328
- Hey, that looks like Jeff.

01:00:13.417 --> 01:00:14.417
- Yep.

01:00:14.418 --> 01:00:15.791
- What?

01:00:15.792 --> 01:00:17.000
What?

01:00:21.041 --> 01:00:22.208
Is that Crystal?

01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:27.040
And what s this other article?

01:00:27.041 --> 01:00:28.874
"Alexander s
Million Dollar Donation

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:30.708
to the LA Medical School."

01:00:30.709 --> 01:00:32.708
They made that donation
yesterday.

01:00:32.709 --> 01:00:33.874
- I guess you know who to thank

01:00:33.875 --> 01:00:35.290
for getting you
off the wait list.

01:00:35.291 --> 01:00:37.249
- That s why he gave me
the gift basket.

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:39.249
He already knew I d gotten in.

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:41.541
No.

01:00:41.542 --> 01:00:44.207
I refuse to let anyone
buy me into medical school,

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:46.082
especially not Jeff Alexander.

01:00:46.083 --> 01:00:47.582
It would make me a hypocrite!

01:00:47.583 --> 01:00:49.624
I don t want to be
another Carlton Strand,

01:00:49.625 --> 01:00:51.916
taking a place from someone
who actually deserves it.

01:00:51.917 --> 01:00:53.165
- I don t know anyone
who deserves

01:00:53.166 --> 01:00:54.446
to be a doctor more than you do.

01:00:57.917 --> 01:00:59.624
Are you still going to the gala?

01:00:59.625 --> 01:01:01.207
- Yeah.

01:01:01.208 --> 01:01:03.207
I m going to confront Jeff,

01:01:03.208 --> 01:01:06.082
find out what s really going on.

01:01:06.083 --> 01:01:07.542
He can t lie to my face, right?

01:01:18.917 --> 01:01:19.959
Thanks.

01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:36.207
- Have fun.

01:01:36.208 --> 01:01:38.290
You girls look good.
Good to see you.

01:01:38.291 --> 01:01:40.207
Have a great time.

01:01:40.208 --> 01:01:41.374
Name?

01:01:41.375 --> 01:01:42.375
- Lilly Springler.

01:01:45.417 --> 01:01:48.708
- Sorry, you re not on the list.

01:01:48.709 --> 01:01:50.374
- I m a guest of Jeff Alexander.

01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:52.124
- There you are.

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:54.082
They mistakenly listed you
as "Spinster."

01:01:54.083 --> 01:01:56.374
Go ahead, enjoy the gala.

01:01:56.375 --> 01:01:57.375
- Thanks.

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:40.290
- It was Calandre s
first day out,

01:02:40.291 --> 01:02:42.290
and she crashed the super yacht
in Capri!

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:45.290
And then she jumped off
and tried to swim...

01:02:45.291 --> 01:02:46.291
- Lilly.

01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:47.291
- Jeffrey?

01:02:47.291 --> 01:02:48.291
- Hi.

01:02:48.292 --> 01:02:50.833
- Wow.

01:02:50.834 --> 01:02:52.833
You look stunning.

01:02:52.834 --> 01:02:55.499
Tonight, again.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.457
- I need to talk to you.

01:02:57.458 --> 01:02:58.582
- Jeffrey?

01:02:58.583 --> 01:03:00.874
I hadn t finished my story.

01:03:00.875 --> 01:03:04.207
- Um, Crystal,
you remember Lilly?

01:03:04.208 --> 01:03:06.207
- Hello.
That s a lovely dress.

01:03:06.208 --> 01:03:07.208
Where did you get it?

01:03:07.209 --> 01:03:08.916
- I, um...

01:03:08.917 --> 01:03:10.207
- I had one just like it.

01:03:10.208 --> 01:03:11.833
But I gave mine to charity.

01:03:11.834 --> 01:03:13.582
Mine had a little...

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:19.040
It is my old dress!

01:03:19.041 --> 01:03:20.207
- What s so funny?
- Nothing.

01:03:20.208 --> 01:03:21.666
- It s the funniest coincidence.

01:03:21.667 --> 01:03:23.416
Lilly here chose my dress

01:03:23.417 --> 01:03:24.833
that I gave
to a consignment shop

01:03:24.834 --> 01:03:26.040
to wear to my gala.

01:03:26.041 --> 01:03:27.666
- Crystal.

01:03:27.667 --> 01:03:28.667
- You won t believe this.

01:03:28.668 --> 01:03:30.582
She s wearing my old dress.

01:03:30.583 --> 01:03:31.583
- Excuse me.

01:03:33.375 --> 01:03:34.615
- That s embarrassing.
- I know.

01:03:37.458 --> 01:03:39.082
- Lilly, wait.

01:03:39.083 --> 01:03:40.708
Lilly, would you stop?

01:03:40.709 --> 01:03:42.416
Good afternoon.

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:45.207
- What was that all about?

01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:46.457
- Guess my first
impression of you

01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:48.416
was right after all.

01:03:48.417 --> 01:03:49.457
- Is that so?

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:53.082
- Yes.
I know about the donation bribe.

01:03:53.083 --> 01:03:55.916
- What donation?

01:03:55.917 --> 01:03:57.457
Lilly, I make
a lot of donations.

01:03:57.458 --> 01:03:59.749
You re gonna have to be
more specific.

01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:03.040
- Look, I don t need your bribes
or your charity or your pity!

01:04:03.041 --> 01:04:04.290
- Pity? What are you talking
about? This...

01:04:04.291 --> 01:04:05.291
- Someone help!
Call an ambulance!

01:04:05.292 --> 01:04:06.582
Help!

01:04:06.583 --> 01:04:08.082
- Call 911!

01:04:08.083 --> 01:04:09.291
- Out of the way.
Move.

01:04:13.333 --> 01:04:14.541
Step back.

01:04:14.542 --> 01:04:16.708
Everyone, get back.
She s a paramedic.

01:04:16.709 --> 01:04:17.709
Give her some room.

01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:19.290
Back! Come on, back.

01:04:30.542 --> 01:04:31.959
- You guys, move, please.

01:04:39.625 --> 01:04:41.916
- He s all right.

01:04:41.917 --> 01:04:43.541
- He s going to be okay.

01:04:43.542 --> 01:04:45.165
- Thank goodness.

01:04:45.166 --> 01:04:47.124
- He s okay, everyone.

01:04:47.125 --> 01:04:48.542
Move.
Give em some space.

01:05:05.583 --> 01:05:07.541
- Okay, buddy.

01:05:07.542 --> 01:05:10.375
Let s get you up slowly.

01:05:14.333 --> 01:05:16.207
- Thank goodness you were here.

01:05:16.208 --> 01:05:17.833
You saved his life.

01:05:17.834 --> 01:05:18.999
I can t thank you enough.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.360
- I m just glad
I was here to help.

01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:24.165
- Thank you.

01:05:24.166 --> 01:05:25.666
That dress looks
much better on you

01:05:25.667 --> 01:05:29.332
than it ever did on me.

01:05:29.333 --> 01:05:31.083
I should get back to my guests.

01:05:34.917 --> 01:05:37.666
- Hi.
You okay?

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:38.709
- Let s go get a drink.

01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:44.000
- I believe these belong to you.

01:05:45.792 --> 01:05:46.959
- They re not even mine.

01:05:49.083 --> 01:05:50.083
- Lilly...
- Jeff, I...

01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:01.041
Our worlds
are just too far apart.

01:06:05.125 --> 01:06:06.917
- If that s how you really feel.

01:06:13.625 --> 01:06:14.945
Guess there s nothing
left to say.

01:06:40.875 --> 01:06:42.666
- Everything okay, son?

01:06:42.667 --> 01:06:44.082
- You haven t had
a thing to eat all day.

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:46.541
What s wrong?

01:06:46.542 --> 01:06:50.249
- It s Lilly.

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:52.500
She says our worlds
are too far apart.

01:06:55.667 --> 01:06:58.666
Can t fix that.

01:06:58.667 --> 01:07:02.207
- I remember when I first
came to work for you.

01:07:02.208 --> 01:07:06.290
I was so overwhelmed
the first day, I nearly quit.

01:07:06.291 --> 01:07:08.249
- I didn t know that.

01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:09.833
- But you didn t.

01:07:09.834 --> 01:07:12.290
- Yeah, why is that?

01:07:12.291 --> 01:07:14.250
- Because I saw
a heartbroken boy.

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:19.374
And I thought I could add
something to your lives

01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:21.291
that had nothing to do
with money or fancy cars.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:27.833
If Lilly is
the right one for you,

01:07:27.834 --> 01:07:29.458
she ll find a way
to close the distance.

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:11.207
- D-Day.

01:09:11.207 --> 01:09:12.917
30.

01:09:38.625 --> 01:09:39.625
Interesting.

01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:25.290
Everett is a comic genius.

01:10:25.291 --> 01:10:26.374
You should see the faces
that he s making.

01:10:26.375 --> 01:10:29.541
He s got one that s like...

01:10:29.542 --> 01:10:31.332
- Funny.

01:10:31.333 --> 01:10:34.124
- It s just...
Yeah.

01:10:34.125 --> 01:10:36.332
But you got to see it in person.

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:37.541
Calling Jeff?

01:10:37.542 --> 01:10:39.249
- No, I am calling
the LA Medical School

01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:41.999
Admissions Committee
to decline my spot.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.624
Hey!

01:10:43.625 --> 01:10:45.332
- I know you re upset
with him right now,

01:10:45.333 --> 01:10:47.666
but don t do anything rash
you re gonna regret, okay?

01:10:47.667 --> 01:10:48.667
- Nick, give it back.

01:10:48.668 --> 01:10:49.874
- All right, I ll give it back.

01:10:49.875 --> 01:10:50.667
- It s so childish,
just give it...

01:10:50.668 --> 01:10:51.958
- Lilly.

01:10:51.959 --> 01:10:53.290
- Vince, what s wrong?

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:54.708
- Well,
today s Megan s birthday,

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:56.332
and I ve been going crazy
for the past three days,

01:10:56.333 --> 01:10:57.708
trying to get in touch with her.

01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:59.040
Think she blocked my number.

01:10:59.041 --> 01:11:00.499
Do you know that Finn thinks
that Megan thinks

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.207
that I m cheating on her?

01:11:02.208 --> 01:11:04.165
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

01:11:04.166 --> 01:11:06.708
Now, I am not at liberty
to speak on Megan s behalf...

01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:08.833
- Because that s absurd,
all right?

01:11:08.834 --> 01:11:11.374
I have never and would never
cheat on Megan.

01:11:11.375 --> 01:11:12.708
I...

01:11:14.166 --> 01:11:16.249
- Okay.
Okay, come on, sit down.

01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:17.250
Come on.

01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:18.250
- Now I feel dizzy.

01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:24.249
- So you re not cheating?

01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:25.708
- No, are you...

01:11:25.709 --> 01:11:27.874
Look, I have been planning
a big surprise party

01:11:27.875 --> 01:11:29.035
for Megan s birthday tonight.

01:11:30.458 --> 01:11:32.249
Yeah.

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:33.791
Okay, look, all right,
I understand

01:11:33.792 --> 01:11:35.708
how my behavior might have
seemed suspicious,

01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:37.916
but I was just trying
to keep the party a secret.

01:11:37.917 --> 01:11:39.040
- Okay, that makes sense.

01:11:39.041 --> 01:11:42.749
But let me ask you something.

01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:45.541
Were you going to invite me
to this party?

01:11:45.542 --> 01:11:47.541
- Well, I couldn t exactly
mail you an invitation.

01:11:47.542 --> 01:11:49.082
I was gonna tell you
at the last minute

01:11:49.083 --> 01:11:50.749
so you wouldn t have to
keep the party a secret.

01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:52.416
But look,
it doesn t even matter.

01:11:52.417 --> 01:11:56.708
There s not going to be a party
once I tell her.

01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:57.749
- Leave it to me.

01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:59.583
- All right.

01:12:15.667 --> 01:12:18.040
- What on earth are you doing?

01:12:18.041 --> 01:12:20.582
- I m studying for my CSET.
I m gonna ace this thing

01:12:20.583 --> 01:12:23.082
and get into UCLA s
education program.

01:12:23.083 --> 01:12:24.916
- You re studying
on your birthday?

01:12:24.917 --> 01:12:26.332
You re even sadder than I am.

01:12:26.333 --> 01:12:28.249
- Also, good news.

01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:29.250
According to this,
40 is the new 30.

01:12:29.251 --> 01:12:31.332
So I don t have to worry
about turning 30

01:12:31.333 --> 01:12:32.999
for another ten years.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.165
- Well, that is good news.

01:12:34.166 --> 01:12:35.166
Now go and get ready.

01:12:35.167 --> 01:12:36.249
- Why?

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:37.749
- It s your birthday.

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:39.624
I m taking you out to dinner
to celebrate.

01:12:39.625 --> 01:12:41.874
- You don t have to do that,
especially after everything that

01:12:41.875 --> 01:12:43.207
happened at the gala with Jeff.

01:12:43.208 --> 01:12:45.416
- Look, tonight is not about me.
It s about you.

01:12:45.417 --> 01:12:47.708
And I won t take no
for an answer.

01:12:47.709 --> 01:12:48.959
- Okay, boss.

01:12:50.458 --> 01:12:51.958
- All right.
- Going.

01:12:51.959 --> 01:12:53.125
- Okay.
Go get dressed.

01:12:59.291 --> 01:13:02.332
- Look at us, two single girls
hitting the town.

01:13:02.333 --> 01:13:03.499
Is this it?

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:05.165
Are you sure you have
the right address?

01:13:05.166 --> 01:13:06.582
- This is the address
they gave me.

01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:09.416
Come on, birthday girl.

01:13:09.417 --> 01:13:11.416
Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:13:11.417 --> 01:13:12.582
- Okay.
- Careful, careful.

01:13:12.583 --> 01:13:14.124
- This is just weird.

01:13:14.125 --> 01:13:17.290
- Give it a minute.

01:13:17.291 --> 01:13:19.457
Surprise!

01:13:19.458 --> 01:13:20.791
- Happy birthday, Megan!

01:13:20.792 --> 01:13:23.582
- You didn t!

01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:25.875
- It wasn t me.

01:13:27.834 --> 01:13:28.917
- Happy birthday, babe.

01:13:30.667 --> 01:13:32.874
I have someone
I want you to meet.

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:34.833
This is Keely,
an old college friend

01:13:34.834 --> 01:13:36.624
and the party planner

01:13:36.625 --> 01:13:38.374
who helped me
pull all this together.

01:13:38.375 --> 01:13:39.541
- Keely?
- Yes.

01:13:39.542 --> 01:13:41.040
- Party planner.

01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:42.582
It all makes sense.

01:13:42.583 --> 01:13:44.249
- Happy birthday, Megan.

01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:45.582
You look very beautiful.

01:13:45.583 --> 01:13:47.749
- Thank you.
- You guys enjoy. Excuse me.

01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:48.750
- Thank you.

01:13:48.751 --> 01:13:50.666
These are for you.

01:13:50.667 --> 01:13:52.374
Babe, you re my whole heart.

01:13:52.375 --> 01:13:55.874
You always have been
and you always will be.

01:13:55.875 --> 01:13:58.374
- I am so sorry
I ever doubted you.

01:13:58.375 --> 01:13:59.958
- It s fine. Come here.

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.207
- Happy birthday, Meggers!

01:14:07.208 --> 01:14:09.416
Come on, everyone,
let s get the party started!

01:14:11.417 --> 01:14:12.541
- Here, give me those.

01:14:47.959 --> 01:14:49.874
- So you enjoying
your birthday party?

01:14:49.875 --> 01:14:51.290
- I am.

01:14:51.291 --> 01:14:52.959
I can t believe
you pulled this off.

01:14:55.917 --> 01:14:57.749
- I almost forgot your present.

01:15:06.417 --> 01:15:07.625
Marry me, babe.

01:15:13.041 --> 01:15:15.332
- With all my heart,
of course I will.

01:15:18.834 --> 01:15:21.541
- Yes!

01:15:21.542 --> 01:15:22.542
- Way to go, Vince!

01:15:24.083 --> 01:15:25.374
- I love you.

01:15:25.375 --> 01:15:26.375
- I love you.

01:15:29.083 --> 01:15:30.582
30 s gonna be a good year.

01:15:30.583 --> 01:15:31.583
- The best.

01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:40.374
- I m gonna get Lilly, okay?

01:15:40.375 --> 01:15:41.958
Your turn.

01:15:41.959 --> 01:15:44.332
- No.
No, no, no.

01:15:44.333 --> 01:15:45.833
- Yes.

01:15:54.667 --> 01:15:55.750
- You did great.

01:16:07.166 --> 01:16:08.166
- What a day.

01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:12.499
So how are the camp construction
plans coming along?

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.999
- Good. We re planning to open
early next year.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.416
- Well, that s good.

01:16:16.417 --> 01:16:17.417
- Yep.

01:16:22.166 --> 01:16:23.833
- Son, come on.

01:16:23.834 --> 01:16:26.416
I mean, if you feel
this strongly about her,

01:16:26.417 --> 01:16:29.416
just call her.

01:16:29.417 --> 01:16:33.082
- Lilly made her opinion of me
extremely clear.

01:16:33.083 --> 01:16:34.834
This was her decision.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.333
I m just biding by it.

01:16:59.959 --> 01:17:02.040
- Guy s napping in his car.

01:17:02.041 --> 01:17:04.541
Someone thinks he s dead.

01:17:04.542 --> 01:17:05.833
- It was a good-intent call.

01:17:05.834 --> 01:17:07.875
- He was snoring.
Loudly.

01:17:13.208 --> 01:17:14.208
Hey, you all right?

01:17:16.625 --> 01:17:17.625
- Yeah, sure.

01:17:17.626 --> 01:17:19.709
I just want to clean my gear.

01:17:31.417 --> 01:17:33.416
- Here s some hot chocolate.

01:17:33.417 --> 01:17:34.750
- Thank you.
- You re welcome.

01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:40.416
I still can t believe
you and Vince

01:17:40.417 --> 01:17:41.582
pulled that off.

01:17:41.583 --> 01:17:43.374
- It was all Vince.

01:17:43.375 --> 01:17:44.455
- Have you heard from Jeff?

01:17:46.417 --> 01:17:47.750
I m surprised.

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:51.416
- I may have told him

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:53.082
I didn t need his pity
or his charity.

01:17:53.083 --> 01:17:55.916
- Lilly.
Money s no issue for Jeff.

01:17:55.917 --> 01:17:56.875
- It s an issue for me.

01:17:56.876 --> 01:17:58.332
- Exactly.

01:17:58.333 --> 01:18:01.040
Your issue, your problem,
not his.

01:18:01.041 --> 01:18:02.958
- I m not gonna let someone
pay for my life.

01:18:02.959 --> 01:18:04.416
- He s a philanthropist.

01:18:04.417 --> 01:18:05.916
I mean,
what s his crime, really?

01:18:05.917 --> 01:18:09.124
He made a donation to help
your lifelong dream come true?

01:18:09.125 --> 01:18:11.207
If you don t work through
your prejudices

01:18:11.208 --> 01:18:12.958
and deal with your own
insecurities,

01:18:12.959 --> 01:18:15.541
you re gonna lose a good guy.

01:18:15.542 --> 01:18:17.375
Maybe the best guy
you ve ever known.

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:34.708
- I know you ve been
feeling down lately,

01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:37.040
and I thought I d make you
a special lunch.

01:18:37.041 --> 01:18:38.332
- Nick, that s really sweet.

01:18:38.333 --> 01:18:41.416
- My famous cold spaghetti pie.

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:43.082
- "Smil"?

01:18:43.083 --> 01:18:46.374
- It s supposed to say "smile,"
but I, I ran out of Parme.

01:18:46.375 --> 01:18:48.124
- You really didn t have to
go to so much effort.

01:18:48.125 --> 01:18:49.833
- It s the least I could do.

01:18:49.834 --> 01:18:53.666
I know you ve been having
a rough time of it lately.

01:18:53.667 --> 01:18:56.290
- I m going to call
the LA Medical School today

01:18:56.291 --> 01:18:59.082
and inform them that
I won t be accepting the spot.

01:18:59.083 --> 01:19:00.708
- I still think it s a mistake.

01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:04.207
- I keep thinking about the
applicant who earned that spot

01:19:04.208 --> 01:19:07.165
and how they re being unfairly
pushed aside the way I was.

01:19:07.166 --> 01:19:11.999
- You re crazy, but I admire
your integrity, kiddo.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.165
- What am I hearing about
you not accepting your spot?

01:19:15.166 --> 01:19:17.999
- I was only accepted
after a bribe...

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.374
A donation was made to take me
off the wait list.

01:19:20.375 --> 01:19:22.374
I cannot accept that spot
in good conscience.

01:19:22.375 --> 01:19:23.833
- Lilly, you were accepted

01:19:23.834 --> 01:19:26.791
after I made a phone call
on your behalf.

01:19:26.792 --> 01:19:28.833
- You did?

01:19:28.834 --> 01:19:30.499
- Yes.
I thought you knew that.

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:31.874
- Boy.

01:19:31.875 --> 01:19:33.207
- I spoke to
the admissions committee

01:19:33.208 --> 01:19:34.666
and I told them
about your passion

01:19:34.667 --> 01:19:36.040
for wanting to become a doctor
and everything

01:19:36.041 --> 01:19:37.499
that you do here
at the medical center.

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:39.666
- Well, what about the donation

01:19:39.667 --> 01:19:41.207
from the Rex Alexander
Foundation?

01:19:41.208 --> 01:19:43.708
- That s an annual donation
they make every year

01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:44.749
in honor of Jeff s mother.

01:19:47.417 --> 01:19:48.709
- I...

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.709
Boy.

01:20:35.458 --> 01:20:37.249
- Lilly.

01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:40.082
- Hi.
Um, is Jeff here?

01:20:40.083 --> 01:20:41.708
- I m afraid he s not.

01:20:41.709 --> 01:20:43.457
Did you try calling his cell?

01:20:43.458 --> 01:20:45.874
- I wasn t sure
if he d answer my calls.

01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:48.541
Um...

01:20:48.542 --> 01:20:52.082
What I have to say
should be said in person.

01:20:52.083 --> 01:20:53.249
- I think he s got a meeting

01:20:53.250 --> 01:20:55.374
with the foreman
at his campsite today.

01:20:55.375 --> 01:20:56.375
- Thank you.

01:20:57.917 --> 01:20:59.125
- Good luck, Lilly.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.833
- Let s put a ropes course
over there.

01:21:22.834 --> 01:21:23.959
And...

01:21:28.625 --> 01:21:29.625
Lilly.

01:21:30.834 --> 01:21:33.416
- Hi.

01:21:33.417 --> 01:21:35.124
- Hey, guys,
can you check out that slope

01:21:35.125 --> 01:21:36.725
and make sure we re okay
with the bridge?

01:21:38.458 --> 01:21:40.499
What are you doing here?

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:43.874
- Veronica told me
you d be here.

01:21:43.875 --> 01:21:46.541
- She did?

01:21:46.542 --> 01:21:48.666
- How are the plans
for the camp going?

01:21:48.667 --> 01:21:50.166
- Good.

01:21:54.083 --> 01:21:57.749
You wanted to talk?

01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:59.499
- You re not going to make it
easy for me, are you?

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:00.999
Guess I deserve that.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.834
I...

01:22:05.834 --> 01:22:08.416
To do what I do, I have to
disconnect emotionally.

01:22:08.417 --> 01:22:09.833
Not because I don t care,

01:22:09.834 --> 01:22:13.249
but because I care too much.

01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:16.666
If I feel everything,
then I can t help anyone.

01:22:16.667 --> 01:22:20.834
And sometimes it s difficult
to come out of that shell.

01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:26.874
I have worked so hard
for every penny.

01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:29.749
And that I ve done
everything by myself

01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:31.750
is a matter of personal pride.

01:22:36.875 --> 01:22:38.290
I m sorry I accused you

01:22:38.291 --> 01:22:41.374
of buying me off the wait list.

01:22:41.375 --> 01:22:43.624
I was wrong.

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:46.249
- You know I would never do
anything like that.

01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:47.874
- I know.

01:22:47.875 --> 01:22:50.249
And I m hoping that
you ll forgive me

01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:52.000
and that we can start over.

01:22:54.083 --> 01:22:55.375
- I don t want to start over.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.290
I don t want to start over

01:23:04.291 --> 01:23:05.651
cause I m already
in love with you.

01:23:11.667 --> 01:23:13.333
- I m in love with you too.

01:23:35.667 --> 01:23:38.249
The first time I saw you
at the grocery store...

01:23:38.250 --> 01:23:40.874
- Yeah?

01:23:40.875 --> 01:23:43.750
- I thought you were the most
handsome man I d ever seen.
