03:32.100 --> 03:34.901
You? You again! Get out!

03:38.182 --> 03:40.463
Do what I told you.
Get out!

03:48.116 --> 03:51.185
Go on! Run! I'll teach you
to keep away from me!

03:52.070 --> 03:53.653
Run!

04:00.139 --> 04:01.327
Papa!

04:04.065 --> 04:06.264
You filthy dog!

04:06.434 --> 04:08.072
You'll settle with me!

04:30.391 --> 04:31.725
Let's go.

06:29.393 --> 06:31.260
Welcome to you, stranger.

06:32.080 --> 06:35.284
My name is Juan de Dios.
I am the bell ringer.

06:35.917 --> 06:38.598
Why are you here?
To see the Rojos?

06:39.720 --> 06:42.356
No, not the Rojos.
Is it the Baxters, maybe?

06:42.423 --> 06:44.124
No, maybe not
even the Baxters.

06:44.192 --> 06:47.227
You want to get rich? Well, for
that you have come to the right place,

06:47.295 --> 06:48.906
if you use your head.

06:49.296 --> 06:53.059
That's because everybody here
has become very rich,

06:53.145 --> 06:54.501
or else they are dead.

06:54.903 --> 06:58.955
What you want to buy?
Some guns? Liquor?

06:59.213 --> 07:02.032
You don't buy. You sell.
You sell lead in exchange for gold.

07:02.360 --> 07:05.475
You will get rich here,
or you'll be killed.

07:05.829 --> 07:08.079
Juan de Dios tolls the bell
once again.

07:24.334 --> 07:26.200
<i>Saludos, amigo!</i>

07:26.300 --> 07:30.053
It's not smart to go
wandering so far from home.

07:32.299 --> 07:34.431
I reckon
he picked the wrong trail.

07:34.525 --> 07:36.469
Or he could have
picked the wrong town.

07:36.516 --> 07:39.187
His big mistake, I think,
was getting born.

07:39.364 --> 07:42.842
If you want any work,
looking like that

07:43.468 --> 07:45.348
you could try being a scarecrow.

07:45.470 --> 07:49.606
Oh, no, the crows are liable
to scare him, maybe.

08:07.158 --> 08:08.591
Hello.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.521
You can't get rich like that.

08:21.615 --> 08:24.801
At most, you will only
succeed in being killed.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.080
With all of the trouble
we have, all we needed was you.

08:31.203 --> 08:34.477
What are you looking for?
Food and something to drink.

08:34.706 --> 08:37.943
Water's over there.
No, no water.

08:38.249 --> 08:40.044
Eating and drinking
and killing.

08:40.111 --> 08:43.660
That's all you can do,
just like the rest of your kind.

08:43.816 --> 08:47.784
By the way,
you'll have to mark this up.

08:48.087 --> 08:52.797
I know. You have no money.
After all, you just got into town.

08:53.055 --> 08:55.193
But if you don't mind
doing a little killing,

08:55.261 --> 08:58.842
you will have no trouble finding
someone eager to pay you.

09:03.602 --> 09:04.910
Hmm.

09:05.104 --> 09:08.283
My roulette wheel.
That, too, was bartered.

09:09.342 --> 09:11.542
No one ever comes here
to play.

09:11.727 --> 09:14.946
We spend our time here
between funerals and burials.

09:15.148 --> 09:17.482
Never saw a town
as dead as this one.

09:21.687 --> 09:23.629
You will never see another
like it.

09:23.839 --> 09:27.424
What's wrong with the place?
We've had too many killings.

09:27.963 --> 09:29.415
You have seen the women?

09:29.578 --> 09:31.646
None of them are women.
They're widows.

09:31.852 --> 09:33.648
The place has only widows.

09:33.890 --> 09:36.251
Here you can only gain respect
by killing other men.

09:36.397 --> 09:38.253
So nobody works anymore.

09:40.923 --> 09:43.261
Seems somebody doesn't
share your opinion.

09:43.492 --> 09:45.089
Yes.

09:54.436 --> 09:56.615
Know why Piripero
looked you over?

09:56.872 --> 09:58.840
To take your measurements.

09:59.075 --> 10:01.242
He is so experienced
he can do it with a glance.

10:01.394 --> 10:03.244
You will be a customer.

10:04.379 --> 10:06.247
Don't laugh. I'm not joking.

10:06.315 --> 10:09.969
I want to warn you that those murderers
will make a corpse out of you one day.

10:10.119 --> 10:12.359
That's why I want you
to get out of here.

10:12.898 --> 10:15.404
You don't want to stay
in this cemetery.

10:16.037 --> 10:17.992
Finish up and get out.

10:20.910 --> 10:22.697
I told you
I can't pay you.

10:23.182 --> 10:24.775
Be my guest,

10:25.361 --> 10:28.119
but get out of San Miguel,
will you?

10:30.632 --> 10:32.085
Where does that lead?

10:32.554 --> 10:34.053
The balcony.

10:36.396 --> 10:39.147
Why are you going there? Hey.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.516
To have a look.

10:41.667 --> 10:43.784
Things always look different
from higher up.

10:44.033 --> 10:45.586
But nothing's up there.

10:45.884 --> 10:47.522
Go ahead and get out!

10:56.427 --> 10:57.739
Who are they?

10:58.629 --> 11:01.956
Bandits.
Bandits and smugglers.

11:02.565 --> 11:03.938
They come down
from Texas.

11:04.111 --> 11:07.041
They cross the frontier to
stock up on guns and liquor.

11:07.344 --> 11:09.043
The cost is much less here.

11:09.218 --> 11:12.568
Then they go back and sell the
guns and liquor to the Indians.

11:14.283 --> 11:17.160
Any town that sells guns and
liquor has gotta be a rich one.

11:17.324 --> 11:20.221
Not the town,
only those who buy and sell,

11:20.289 --> 11:22.970
and the bosses are the ones
who clean up.

11:23.181 --> 11:26.494
Yeah? Somebody has to run the place.
Every town has a boss.

11:26.766 --> 11:29.097
That's true, but when
there are two around,

11:29.319 --> 11:31.615
then I'd say that
there is one too many.

11:31.873 --> 11:33.466
Two bosses?

11:34.333 --> 11:35.973
Very interesting.

11:36.105 --> 11:38.081
Interesting is right.

11:38.541 --> 11:41.109
The Rojos boys, three brothers
who sell liquor.

11:41.177 --> 11:45.391
And then there's the Baxters,
big gun merchants.

11:46.234 --> 11:50.358
If I'm not mistaken, you already
met Baxter's gang, didn't you?

11:50.586 --> 11:52.162
Yeah, we met.

11:52.443 --> 11:56.591
But you're lucky. They don't usually
limit their fire to the mule.

11:56.754 --> 11:59.659
A man leaves his own land and
looks around for any reason,

11:59.729 --> 12:03.865
Juan de Dios tolls the bell and
Piripero sells another coffin.

12:03.933 --> 12:05.366
Two bosses.

12:08.046 --> 12:12.239
They've enlisted all the scum that hangs
around both sides of the frontier,

12:12.374 --> 12:14.508
and they pay in dollars.

12:17.394 --> 12:19.034
The Baxters over there.

12:20.205 --> 12:21.751
The Rojos there.

12:22.918 --> 12:24.418
Me right in the middle.

12:24.486 --> 12:25.898
Where you do what?

12:27.957 --> 12:29.951
Crazy bell ringer
was right.

12:30.192 --> 12:32.622
There's money to be made
in a place like this.

12:32.950 --> 12:37.265
If you're thinking what I suspect,
I tell you, don't try it.

12:38.479 --> 12:40.657
Which one of the two
is the stronger?

12:41.032 --> 12:43.609
Which one of them
is stronger?

12:44.101 --> 12:47.639
Well, the Rojos,
especially Ramon.

12:58.814 --> 13:03.219
Don Miguel Rojo,
I want to talk to you.

13:03.757 --> 13:07.131
Don Miguel, I hear
you're hiring on men.

13:07.881 --> 13:10.270
Well, I might
just be available.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.933
I gotta tell you
before you hire me,

13:17.720 --> 13:19.807
I don't work cheap.

13:35.432 --> 13:37.208
Get three coffins ready.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.599
Listen, stranger.
Didn't you get the idea?

14:07.692 --> 14:10.082
We don't like to see
bad boys like you in town.

14:10.176 --> 14:11.816
Go get your mule.

14:12.190 --> 14:14.932
You let him
get away from you?

14:15.380 --> 14:17.837
That's what I want to talk
to you about.

14:18.188 --> 14:20.109
He's feeling real bad.

14:21.538 --> 14:22.780
My mule.

14:23.022 --> 14:26.833
He got all riled up when you men
fired those shots at his feet.

14:29.340 --> 14:32.263
Hey, are you making
some kind of joke?

14:32.331 --> 14:34.353
Mmm-mmm. No.

14:34.845 --> 14:37.422
See, I understand you men
were just playing around.

14:37.539 --> 14:39.765
But the mule...
He just doesn't get it.

14:40.038 --> 14:42.473
Of course, if you were
to all apologize...

14:54.586 --> 14:56.797
I don't think it's nice,
you laughing.

15:00.803 --> 15:03.263
You see, my mule
don't like people laughing.

15:04.575 --> 15:07.246
He gets the crazy idea
you're laughing at him.

15:07.733 --> 15:10.807
Now, if you apologize,
like I know you're going to,

15:11.440 --> 15:14.649
I might convince him that
you really didn't mean it.

15:43.435 --> 15:45.703
I saw the whole thing.
You killed all four of them.

15:47.730 --> 15:49.861
You'll pay all right.
You'll be strung up.

15:52.579 --> 15:53.911
Who are you?

15:54.336 --> 15:55.929
Don't fire a shot.

15:57.749 --> 16:01.177
I'm John Baxter, sheriff.

16:02.604 --> 16:06.823
Yeah? Well, if you're the sheriff, you
better get these men underground.

16:20.552 --> 16:23.090
My mistake. Four coffins.

16:41.169 --> 16:43.019
I told you I wasn't cheap,

16:43.278 --> 16:45.667
but I think you'll find
it's worth your while.

16:45.747 --> 16:48.595
...97, 98, 99, 100.

16:49.517 --> 16:51.219
The rest
when you're all done.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.749
When do I start?

16:54.689 --> 16:57.146
I'm not in a hurry,
at least for the moment.

16:57.662 --> 16:59.160
I'd say with
four less Baxters,

16:59.227 --> 17:01.728
right now is as good a time
to start as any.

17:01.902 --> 17:05.933
In a few days I hear there will be a troop
of cavalry passing through San Miguel.

17:06.049 --> 17:09.867
I wouldn't want the military sticking
their long noses into our business.

17:11.439 --> 17:13.663
You seem to be well informed.

17:15.303 --> 17:20.387
In these parts, a man's life often
depends on a mere scrap of information.

17:21.566 --> 17:24.440
This thing couldn't have been
very useful to its owner.

17:26.988 --> 17:31.140
My brother Ramon did that. He often
uses it for target practice.

17:31.359 --> 17:34.701
With a gun in his hand,
no one stands in his way.

17:35.463 --> 17:38.122
The suit of armor is
one of his favorite targets,

17:38.233 --> 17:40.886
naturally, when he does not
have anything better to shoot.

17:42.175 --> 17:45.994
Well, I'll be kind of curious
to meet this brother of yours.

17:47.075 --> 17:48.360
Ah.

17:48.776 --> 17:52.132
This is Chico, one
of the most trusted of my men.

17:52.714 --> 17:55.599
Follow him. He will bring you
to your room.

17:55.883 --> 17:57.848
I would like you
to feel at home.

17:58.486 --> 18:01.644
Well, I never found home
that great, but let's go.

18:20.091 --> 18:21.440
Who's that?

18:21.838 --> 18:25.868
Her name's Marisol.
You just forget about her.

18:29.133 --> 18:31.301
This one will be your room.

19:02.467 --> 19:04.220
You gave him $100.

19:04.469 --> 19:07.270
We never pay that much.

19:07.338 --> 19:09.573
Can you explain to me
why you have taken him on?

19:09.641 --> 19:13.450
To have that filthy gringo around the
house and to give him $100 besides?

19:13.614 --> 19:15.933
We have never paid anybody
so much.

19:16.398 --> 19:19.073
You cannot leave someone like that
to do what he wants around here.

19:19.200 --> 19:22.962
He's capable of doing anything. And
I want law and order in this place.

19:23.969 --> 19:28.022
If that is all you want,
there is a much cheaper way.

19:28.608 --> 19:30.318
Just snuff him out.

19:32.847 --> 19:34.606
And who will be the one? You?

19:34.699 --> 19:36.386
Yes, why not?

19:36.918 --> 19:38.284
A shot in his back,

19:38.354 --> 19:41.289
then you would have him out
of the way in no time at all.

19:42.658 --> 19:45.453
Listen, I could do it easily
right now.

19:46.741 --> 19:51.131
He won't be expecting it,
and I'd get back the $100.

19:54.068 --> 19:57.705
You're stupid, Esteban!
Even if you are my brother!

19:58.373 --> 20:01.575
A bullet in the back, eh?
And it is ended!

20:01.712 --> 20:04.218
And what happens if your hand
should tremble slightly?

20:04.345 --> 20:05.882
And he's only been hurt?

20:06.210 --> 20:10.638
And with the cavalry arriving in town
and that Yankee so quick on the draw.

20:10.825 --> 20:13.566
I was only thinking... You
mustn't think of anything!

20:13.894 --> 20:15.815
You let me
do the thinking instead.

20:16.003 --> 20:20.694
Go and see the <i>americano</i>. Just ask him
if he needs anything and make friends.

20:22.263 --> 20:24.273
Get one thing clear
in that head of yours.

20:24.343 --> 20:27.851
This is going to be a quiet
town until Ramon gets back!

20:29.154 --> 20:32.489
Is that clear? A quiet town.

20:46.004 --> 20:48.474
I am Esteban Rojo.
My brother asked me to...

20:54.143 --> 20:55.549
What are you doing?

20:56.720 --> 20:58.384
Moving.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.668
But didn't you know
all our men live here with us?

21:04.239 --> 21:09.395
That's all very cozy, but I don't
find you men all that appealing.

21:09.677 --> 21:13.659
Besides, your brother said he didn't
have any need for me anymore right now.

21:37.696 --> 21:39.453
Halt!

21:41.327 --> 21:43.928
- Sergeant?
- Yes, <i>Capitan</i> ?

21:44.646 --> 21:47.091
Tell the men we'll be spending
tonight here in this place.

21:47.282 --> 21:49.383
Arrange it so they can
pick up the supplies here.

21:49.527 --> 21:51.985
Also, double the guard in order
to watch the stagecoach there.

21:52.128 --> 21:53.603
Yes, sir.

21:54.658 --> 21:57.174
What do you suppose they're
carrying in that coach?

21:57.242 --> 21:58.909
It'd be easy
to find out.

21:59.132 --> 22:01.645
Get up close to it and take a
little look at what's in it.

22:01.803 --> 22:04.333
If they fire at you,
you know it's gold.

22:05.083 --> 22:07.004
Not a bad idea.

22:33.056 --> 22:34.696
Looking for anything?

22:36.195 --> 22:37.390
Hello.

22:37.882 --> 22:39.358
Get out of here, Yankee.

22:53.837 --> 22:55.430
Why aren't you sleeping?

22:56.554 --> 22:59.389
When I see you staring
like that, it bothers me.

23:00.186 --> 23:03.302
I still keep wondering
what was in that stagecoach.

23:03.536 --> 23:06.183
It's something they seem
to think is very important.

23:06.699 --> 23:10.400
I asked a few questions of the
captain and almost was arrested.

23:12.033 --> 23:13.704
Who's Marisol?

23:15.302 --> 23:17.733
You better get some sleep.
You need it.

23:18.439 --> 23:20.709
It's much too dangerous,
even for you.

23:22.840 --> 23:25.245
All I did is ask
who she was.

23:26.495 --> 23:28.018
She is a woman.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.751
And Ramon's madly in love
with her.

23:30.853 --> 23:32.610
Does that make it clear
to you?

23:35.573 --> 23:38.584
Everybody in this town
talks about Ramon.

23:38.795 --> 23:40.575
Kind of curious
to meet him.

23:41.208 --> 23:45.027
If you are smart, you will try to stay
clear of Ramon as long as possible.

23:51.985 --> 23:56.010
There are the soldiers.
They are moving on very quietly.

24:00.815 --> 24:02.270
Strange.

24:02.996 --> 24:04.730
They're headed
for the frontier.

24:09.767 --> 24:11.058
Tell me,

24:13.632 --> 24:15.829
is that the way
you go to bed every night?

24:17.029 --> 24:19.466
Don't worry.
I didn't dirty the sheets.

24:21.319 --> 24:23.620
No, wait. I'm coming, too.

24:23.687 --> 24:26.963
I want to see for myself how you're
going to get yourself in trouble.

24:27.267 --> 24:28.931
All right. All right.
Go ahead.

25:14.455 --> 25:17.124
It's like playing cowboys
and Indians.

25:20.800 --> 25:23.179
- Captain.
- Welcome, Lieutenant.

25:24.348 --> 25:26.306
There is your gold
as promised.

25:26.750 --> 25:30.265
I hope the guns you will be giving us
will be equally useful to our army.

25:30.421 --> 25:33.790
Rest assured, Captain. We'll
check them over together.

27:07.602 --> 27:10.270
Get their clothes on again,
and hurry.

27:11.972 --> 27:13.907
Be sure to place them
around right.

27:14.004 --> 27:16.300
Remember. They died
fighting among themselves.

27:34.550 --> 27:35.932
Rubio!

27:41.686 --> 27:43.887
There. It's Ramon.

27:57.885 --> 27:59.876
This is my brother Ramon.

28:00.555 --> 28:02.219
I think I mentioned him.

28:02.657 --> 28:04.458
Everybody talks about Ramon.

28:04.561 --> 28:08.521
And many speak of you, too,
my dear brother included.

28:08.872 --> 28:12.761
Well, I hope
they say nice things.

28:13.745 --> 28:15.168
Did you have a good trip?

28:15.953 --> 28:17.517
It was tiring.

28:17.955 --> 28:20.563
It was terribly hot
on the road during the day.

28:21.091 --> 28:25.201
And stagecoaches are an
uncomfortable way to travel.

28:25.446 --> 28:28.669
Well, I'm sure you'll be
in great shape in no time.

28:28.950 --> 28:31.644
The <i>americano</i> cannot
wait to get into action.

28:32.353 --> 28:35.767
I am sorry. He's going
to be a disappointed man.

28:35.955 --> 28:37.032
How's that?

28:37.126 --> 28:39.094
The Baxters
accepted the invitation.

28:39.211 --> 28:41.156
They'll come tonight,
Don Miguel.

28:41.929 --> 28:44.084
The Baxters coming here?
You must be out of your head.

28:44.198 --> 28:47.083
Chico followed my orders. I
told him to invite them here.

28:47.301 --> 28:49.191
Ramon, what is this?

28:50.771 --> 28:53.140
I have found out many things
when I was traveling,

28:53.207 --> 28:56.478
and I have decided
that it's very stupid,

28:56.744 --> 29:00.847
to just keep on shooting at each
other and without any results.

29:01.093 --> 29:02.967
You've gone
out of your mind, Ramon.

29:03.384 --> 29:06.247
No, I have come
to my senses, Esteban.

29:06.762 --> 29:08.121
Believe me.

29:08.941 --> 29:10.123
Trust me.

29:11.354 --> 29:13.527
Life can be so precious.

29:13.721 --> 29:16.907
It's foolish to risk
losing it every minute, no?

29:18.640 --> 29:21.241
There's plenty of space
for everybody in this town.

29:21.545 --> 29:23.092
Even Baxters.

29:24.450 --> 29:26.325
For this reason,

29:27.871 --> 29:30.636
I've decided to hang
my gun up on the wall.

29:31.412 --> 29:33.564
I think that
Ramon has the right idea.

29:33.681 --> 29:36.891
I, too, am getting tired of these killings.
They must stop.

29:38.414 --> 29:41.654
This is all
very, very touching.

29:42.443 --> 29:44.130
You mean
you don't admire peace?

29:44.528 --> 29:47.574
It's not real easy to like
something you know nothing about.

29:48.652 --> 29:52.165
Stay in San Miguel and you may
just profit from the experience.

29:52.306 --> 29:55.402
No, thanks. I'll be moving on.

30:01.776 --> 30:04.255
Here's your money,
Don Miguel.

30:04.419 --> 30:06.574
I only used
a small amount of it.

30:06.785 --> 30:10.416
I don't like to take money
unless I feel I've earned it.

30:12.186 --> 30:14.961
Now, why are you so hasty?
You should stay here.

30:15.617 --> 30:17.655
You might enjoy
dining with us tonight.

30:18.241 --> 30:21.685
You see, the Baxters have four men
in the cemetery on account of me.

30:22.060 --> 30:24.731
I don't think
they'd appreciate my presence.

30:32.557 --> 30:35.859
I don't like that <i>americano</i>.
He's too smart to be just a hired fighter.

30:36.187 --> 30:37.794
At shooting a pistol
no one can touch him.

30:37.862 --> 30:38.881
I can see that.

30:38.975 --> 30:42.866
When someone with that face works with
his gun, you may count on two things.

30:43.051 --> 30:45.869
He's fast on the trigger,
but he's also intelligent.

30:46.050 --> 30:48.627
That makes him too dangerous
for you, I think, my brothers.

30:48.768 --> 30:51.507
And now that he's gone, will you
please explain that silly nonsense

30:51.576 --> 30:54.133
about hanging up your gun and
making up with the Baxters?

30:55.234 --> 30:56.913
Is it possible, old fellow,

30:57.249 --> 31:00.107
that you'll never be able to reach
any conclusions on your own?

31:01.020 --> 31:04.090
Don't you think our government and the
<i>americanos</i> will find those bodies,

31:04.183 --> 31:06.339
and then start
an investigation?

31:06.456 --> 31:07.791
They'll investigate,
all right,

31:08.059 --> 31:11.751
and we'll be quiet
and peacefully abide our time.

31:12.296 --> 31:15.265
We know nothing about the
massacre at the Rio Bravo, eh?

31:16.067 --> 31:18.367
I arranged for the bodies
to be lying,

31:18.498 --> 31:20.958
as if both companies
killed each other.

31:21.706 --> 31:24.167
But do you think
they'll believe it?

31:24.374 --> 31:26.604
Yes, I think so.

31:26.978 --> 31:29.079
Because if they don't
find some guilty party,

31:29.181 --> 31:32.273
it would be a pretty good reason
to call off the investigation.

31:32.549 --> 31:35.284
Yes, but what
about the Baxters?

31:35.352 --> 31:37.076
The Baxters?

31:38.222 --> 31:40.988
They want nothing more
than to live in peace.

31:41.191 --> 31:43.519
We'll let them have
their own way for a while.

31:43.694 --> 31:45.088
So forget about the Baxters.

31:45.182 --> 31:49.258
We'll take care of them later
when the investigation finishes.

31:55.656 --> 31:58.208
That was a fine idea
that you had.

31:58.393 --> 32:00.129
What was it again?

32:00.551 --> 32:02.566
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

32:03.131 --> 32:08.235
The Baxters on one side.
The Rojos on the other.

32:09.603 --> 32:11.492
And you'd be in the middle.

32:12.335 --> 32:14.795
The only problem is that
they've joined up.

32:17.513 --> 32:21.472
Now you are without a job, and you don't
have money to pay me what you owe me.

32:21.749 --> 32:25.252
There is only one thing for you to do.
Leave here immediately.

32:25.385 --> 32:27.165
I will forget about
what you owe me.

32:27.516 --> 32:31.101
And you leave San Miguel and never
come back for the rest of your days.

32:31.325 --> 32:35.154
Joe, I have prepared the wagon
the way you asked me to.

32:35.248 --> 32:38.645
It's sitting out in the back
here with two empty coffins.

32:38.926 --> 32:40.542
What are you up to?

32:40.800 --> 32:42.580
Are you changing
your profession?

32:43.120 --> 32:45.228
If you want to go on living,
you'd better.

32:45.589 --> 32:49.047
In my opinion,
you'll make a fine pallbearer.

32:51.295 --> 32:53.428
Close this place
and come with me, huh?

32:53.530 --> 32:57.738
Oh, close up?
It's done. Where are we going?

32:57.901 --> 33:01.018
I'd like to know where we are
going, or is it a secret?

33:02.239 --> 33:06.009
Down by the river. Have a look
at some corpses down there.

33:50.070 --> 33:52.677
The Rojos say, "Come to
dinner," and we must go.

33:52.973 --> 33:54.903
But I don't like it at all,

33:55.746 --> 33:58.627
even if they've granted all the
guarantees we've demanded.

34:00.619 --> 34:04.227
We'll go along with it,
but don't touch anything.

34:04.461 --> 34:07.249
You mustn't eat.
You mustn't drink.

34:07.988 --> 34:11.654
You just keep your eyes open
and keep your wits about you.

34:38.168 --> 34:40.400
Are you sure
that nobody has seen us?

34:40.570 --> 34:42.507
Only a ghost or two.

34:42.696 --> 34:45.577
Oh, no, no, no. Don't joke
about things like this.

34:45.670 --> 34:48.318
Ghosts are better left
where they are.

34:49.746 --> 34:52.349
You look as though this
place suits you very well.

34:52.606 --> 34:56.025
If you go on like this, you
will soon be here permanently.

35:08.771 --> 35:09.755
I do not understand.

35:09.825 --> 35:13.761
Why is it with all those bodies down by
the river we are just burying these two?

35:13.971 --> 35:16.272
We're not.
We're not gonna bury them.

35:16.339 --> 35:18.306
What do you mean
we're not burying them?

35:18.868 --> 35:21.258
That's right.
We're not gonna bury them.

35:22.713 --> 35:24.013
If we are not going to
bury them,

35:24.081 --> 35:26.506
I would like to know
what we will use them for?

35:27.351 --> 35:29.832
Why are we taking
the trouble to do this?

35:31.027 --> 35:33.390
The dead can be
very useful sometimes.

35:36.894 --> 35:39.742
They've helped me out of
tough spots more than once.

35:46.170 --> 35:48.060
First, they don't talk.

35:50.426 --> 35:53.799
Second, they can be made to look
alive if I manage it right.

35:56.283 --> 35:58.204
And, third...

35:59.539 --> 36:01.717
Well, third, if you shoot
them, there's no worry,

36:01.785 --> 36:03.217
'cause they're dead already.

36:03.888 --> 36:05.162
Understand?

36:06.090 --> 36:08.508
It doesn't make a bit of sense
to me, and I'm getting out.

36:08.629 --> 36:10.710
I'm alive, and I want to remain
with the living, understand?

36:10.778 --> 36:12.679
And when I'm dead, I'll want
to remain with the dead.

36:12.747 --> 36:15.587
I would be unhappy if somebody living
forces me to remain with the living.

36:15.681 --> 36:17.297
I hope that's clear.

36:18.188 --> 36:22.155
And, also, I don't like the idea that
you've placed those bodies there!

36:22.311 --> 36:26.626
The man buried there is the only one who
died of pneumonia in this cursed town!

36:26.833 --> 36:28.543
Take it easy now, will you?

36:28.637 --> 36:31.565
These two friends of ours here
are gonna help me pay your bill.

36:32.268 --> 36:33.744
Get up there!

37:01.928 --> 37:04.664
The only reason they could
have to start a war with us,

37:04.732 --> 37:07.574
would be to kidnap you
from your husband's side.

37:08.836 --> 37:10.854
He's gallant, this Rojo.

37:11.037 --> 37:13.595
I really didn't think him
capable of compliments.

37:13.993 --> 37:18.678
And he's not. All that he says
is false, like his proposals.

37:18.866 --> 37:23.458
You women. If things aren't complicated
for you, you become suspicious.

37:23.598 --> 37:27.417
Yes, because to me,
it just didn't seem right.

37:27.688 --> 37:31.190
It went too smoothly.
I don't trust them.

37:31.306 --> 37:33.649
You'd like to prove me wrong,
wouldn't you?

37:33.766 --> 37:35.383
Always the same thing.

37:37.866 --> 37:40.068
Good night.
Good night.

38:18.701 --> 38:20.880
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

38:21.840 --> 38:25.528
I just want you to know why the Rojos
want to make peace all of a sudden.

38:27.297 --> 38:29.265
You see, there was once
a wagon load of gold

38:29.333 --> 38:31.750
that the soldiers
were taking to the border.

38:40.094 --> 38:42.433
John,
come up here quickly.

38:48.852 --> 38:53.822
Sorry, but when a husband finds
a man in his wife's bedroom,

38:53.891 --> 38:56.092
you're never sure
how he's gonna react.

38:59.372 --> 39:01.691
Give him $500.
How's that?

39:01.832 --> 39:03.519
Give the money to him.

39:04.351 --> 39:06.845
He has an interesting story.
Listen to him.

39:08.105 --> 39:10.102
That's the right idea?
You didn't misunderstand?

39:10.242 --> 39:12.140
I get the wrong idea only
when it suits me.

39:12.187 --> 39:13.443
- Ramon.
- What is it?

39:13.593 --> 39:15.311
The soldiers, the ones
who were escorting the gold...

39:15.379 --> 39:18.067
Two of those soldiers got away. They
are hiding out in the cemetery.

39:18.215 --> 39:20.855
The Baxters.
They're about to capture them.

39:23.620 --> 39:25.564
Rubio! Get the men!

39:28.141 --> 39:29.898
You are well-informed, eh?

39:30.193 --> 39:34.256
A man's life in these parts often
depends on a mere scrap of information.

39:34.490 --> 39:36.248
Your brother's own words.

39:36.669 --> 39:39.201
Tell me. Why are you
doing this for us?

39:42.773 --> 39:44.447
$500.

39:51.782 --> 39:54.709
With these two soldiers
as witnesses against Ramon,

39:54.818 --> 39:58.520
the government will be able to rid the
town of the Rojos and their whole band.

39:58.668 --> 40:01.058
Then San Miguel
will have just one boss.

40:01.324 --> 40:02.524
Hurry!

40:17.741 --> 40:19.191
Let's go!

40:22.799 --> 40:23.994
Coming with us?

40:24.114 --> 40:28.304
Oh, no. When a man's got money in his
pocket, he begins to appreciate peace.

40:29.405 --> 40:30.653
Come on!

41:39.900 --> 41:41.915
Let's leave
the horses here.

42:04.874 --> 42:06.665
Who's there? Come out!

42:28.654 --> 42:30.270
What do you think?

42:30.691 --> 42:32.215
I don't know.

42:33.035 --> 42:35.027
There's something about it
I don't like.

42:35.213 --> 42:37.931
Too still to be wounded.
More like dummies.

42:38.306 --> 42:40.508
Sure, dummies that are
very interesting to the Rojos.

42:40.625 --> 42:42.234
Better hide. Hurry.

44:57.468 --> 44:58.520
What'll we do?

44:58.733 --> 45:00.739
Take two men
and circle around to the side.

45:00.935 --> 45:04.076
Try to keep them busy long enough
for me to get those two down there.

45:04.215 --> 45:06.769
Go on. Go on. Quickly.

45:43.972 --> 45:46.690
Keep me covered. I am going
to take care of those two.

46:24.198 --> 46:28.251
Listen, Baxter! You can
have them now if you like!

46:28.438 --> 46:30.963
Since dead men can't talk!

46:42.472 --> 46:44.955
It seems
they didn't like my joke.

46:45.447 --> 46:48.165
We'll let them go home
in a little while.

48:32.383 --> 48:33.872
Keep this bad boy
as our guest,

48:33.965 --> 48:36.917
only until Baxter leaves San
Miguel and heads for the frontier.

48:37.058 --> 48:38.656
Put him in the cellar.

48:45.430 --> 48:47.097
Esteban, good work.

48:47.225 --> 48:51.335
With Antonio as our prisoner, the
Baxters have to give in to us.

48:51.466 --> 48:53.200
Now we can make
any kind of demand.

48:53.317 --> 48:55.683
Don Miguel! Don Miguel!

49:00.678 --> 49:02.992
What has happened?
Talk, will you?

49:03.248 --> 49:05.883
I don't know,
but somebody shot at me.

49:06.085 --> 49:07.444
Marisol!

49:08.987 --> 49:10.607
Marisol!

49:10.911 --> 49:13.023
Where are you, Marisol?

49:26.538 --> 49:29.339
It's strange how you always
manage to be

49:29.407 --> 49:31.598
in the right place
at the right time.

49:38.383 --> 49:42.703
It's nothing serious. A headache
that will pass. She'll sleep.

49:47.740 --> 49:51.535
Keep your eyes open. She's not to
move from that room. You hear?

49:58.970 --> 50:01.750
I wouldn't mention anything
about me bringing her here.

50:01.939 --> 50:04.889
I wouldn't want the Rojos
to think I was on your side.

50:05.334 --> 50:06.810
Don't be worried.

50:06.944 --> 50:11.941
I'm a woman who's rich enough to
appreciate the men my money can buy.

50:12.573 --> 50:14.051
I've been to talk
to the Rojos.

50:14.190 --> 50:16.320
They'll give back Antonio
in exchange for Marisol.

50:16.387 --> 50:18.196
It'll take place
in the morning.

50:21.159 --> 50:24.053
Very soon
you are going to be rich.

50:29.910 --> 50:33.120
Yeah, and that's not
gonna break my heart.

52:15.400 --> 52:18.570
Where is she? You said
I'd be able to see her!

52:18.733 --> 52:20.104
Where is she?

52:21.497 --> 52:23.507
I wanna see her!

52:23.576 --> 52:25.714
Come back here, Jesus.
Come here. Where is she?

52:25.949 --> 52:28.619
I want to see her!
I want to see her!

52:28.737 --> 52:32.649
Why can't I look at her?
I want to see her!

52:51.152 --> 52:53.711
Go. Go to him, Marisol.

53:18.547 --> 53:19.950
Mama!

53:22.949 --> 53:25.573
Mama!
Jesus!

53:32.671 --> 53:33.911
Mama!

53:36.247 --> 53:37.398
Jesus!

53:37.465 --> 53:39.653
Mama! Mama!

54:29.784 --> 54:30.884
Julio!

54:32.086 --> 54:33.396
Marisol.

54:35.318 --> 54:36.657
Get Julio.

54:47.152 --> 54:49.281
You were warned
to get out of town.

54:50.195 --> 54:53.404
Now I'm gonna make you
pay once and for all.

54:55.327 --> 54:57.211
Let him be.

55:36.101 --> 55:38.362
You better get going.
Ramon's waiting.

55:42.491 --> 55:45.765
And, you, get that kid
home where he belongs.

56:33.137 --> 56:34.926
A pig, that Ramon.

56:36.042 --> 56:38.759
What's Ramon
got to do with them?

56:39.041 --> 56:40.470
You weren't told, eh?

56:43.445 --> 56:45.636
In this part of the world,
the story is very old.

56:45.704 --> 56:48.482
A happy little family
until trouble comes along.

56:49.007 --> 56:50.607
And trouble has
the name of Ramon.

56:50.675 --> 56:53.344
Claiming the husband cheated
at cards, which wasn't true,

56:53.411 --> 56:56.565
he gets the wife
to live with him as hostage.

56:57.080 --> 56:58.392
And the husband?

56:58.650 --> 57:01.110
Him? There's nothing
for him to do.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.222
The Rojos threatened
to kill his little boy Jesus,

57:04.343 --> 57:06.592
and he was forced
to accept things.

57:09.461 --> 57:11.418
That Ramon is smart.

57:13.386 --> 57:15.266
Where are you going?

57:19.173 --> 57:21.281
To the Rojos
to look for a job.

57:27.466 --> 57:29.903
I am glad we have the
<i>americano</i> with us.

57:30.082 --> 57:32.550
It's the best thing that could
have happened to us, you know,

57:32.918 --> 57:35.920
'cause if either government
starts an inquiry,

57:35.987 --> 57:37.988
we'll need every man
we can get.

57:39.457 --> 57:43.046
I guess you know to be at war
with the Baxters now,

57:43.116 --> 57:44.967
is worse than sitting
on a big case of dynamite.

57:45.060 --> 57:47.989
Where should we put this?
Put it over there.

57:55.823 --> 57:58.203
Come on, everybody!
Drink up!

58:29.975 --> 58:32.476
Good shooting.
Very good shooting.

58:32.642 --> 58:34.745
When you want to kill a man,
you must shoot for his heart.

58:34.813 --> 58:37.562
And the Winchester
is the best weapon.

58:37.715 --> 58:40.678
That's very nice,
but I'll stick with my .45.

58:41.592 --> 58:44.755
When a man with a .45
meets a man with a rifle,

58:44.923 --> 58:48.152
the man with the pistol
will be a dead man.

58:48.761 --> 58:51.736
That's an old Mexican proverb,
and it's true.

58:53.164 --> 58:54.782
You believe that?

58:56.567 --> 58:59.772
Paquito, take five men and escort
Marisol to the small house.

58:59.866 --> 59:01.972
And stay there till I return.

59:11.082 --> 59:13.759
Everything's prepared.
Do not be worried.

59:14.386 --> 59:16.219
I will return tomorrow.

59:16.455 --> 59:18.163
All the wagons are ready.
We can leave.

59:18.257 --> 59:22.357
Everyone, enjoy yourselves
during my absence.

59:39.861 --> 59:42.429
You heard Ramon.
Let's have a good time.

59:50.798 --> 59:54.523
<i>~ Do you remember</i>
<i>sweet Becky from Pike ~</i>

59:54.943 --> 59:57.967
<i>~ She roamed the world</i>
<i>with her lover Ike ~</i>

59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.708
<i>~ Ike and Betsy ~</i>

01:00:00.949 --> 01:00:02.716
<i>~ Betsy from Pike ~</i>

01:00:06.214 --> 01:00:07.854
He weighs over a ton.

01:00:08.018 --> 01:00:10.431
Of course, with all he
poured into himself.

01:01:27.902 --> 01:01:28.902
Papa,

01:01:30.238 --> 01:01:33.272
did you not tell me
no one could go see Mama?

01:01:34.842 --> 01:01:36.317
That's right.

01:01:36.833 --> 01:01:39.480
Then why does that man see her
when I cannot?

01:01:43.118 --> 01:01:45.986
- I want Mama.
- Go away from the door.

01:01:46.054 --> 01:01:48.992
Quiet! Quiet.
We cannot show ourselves.

01:01:49.090 --> 01:01:51.458
You must remember that.
You must stay away.

01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:03.705
Hello.

01:02:23.975 --> 01:02:25.943
There's somebody shooting
up at the small house.

01:02:26.011 --> 01:02:29.124
Saddle the horses immediately!
Come on. Let's go!

01:02:57.342 --> 01:02:59.065
Look out!

01:03:46.553 --> 01:03:48.568
Here you are.
Now, take this money.

01:03:49.247 --> 01:03:52.411
It's enough to live on for a while.
Now, get across the border.

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:55.266
Get as much distance between
yourselves and San Miguel as possible.

01:03:55.333 --> 01:03:57.494
How may we thank you
for what you are doing?

01:03:58.431 --> 01:04:01.571
Don't try. Just get going
before the Rojos get here.

01:04:05.788 --> 01:04:07.561
Why do you do this for us?

01:04:09.044 --> 01:04:12.215
Why? 'Cause I knew
someone like you once.

01:04:12.324 --> 01:04:14.685
There was no one there
to help. Now, get moving.

01:04:17.783 --> 01:04:19.493
Get moving.

01:04:20.454 --> 01:04:22.234
Get out of here!

01:05:04.635 --> 01:05:06.864
What do you see, Chico?

01:05:07.004 --> 01:05:10.027
They're all dead.
They massacred them.

01:05:10.508 --> 01:05:12.089
They kidnapped Marisol!

01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:14.080
This looks like
the work of the Baxters.

01:05:14.312 --> 01:05:17.614
Quick, let's get back before
they attack our house and the town.

01:07:12.814 --> 01:07:15.390
Chico,
give out the ammunition.

01:07:15.549 --> 01:07:19.420
Esteban, spread your men around the house.
Keep your eyes open.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.582
Miguel, Paco, Vincente,
Martin, behind the house.

01:07:22.657 --> 01:07:26.307
Manolo and Alvaro,
come with me. Stay alert.

01:07:26.565 --> 01:07:30.407
The way they killed the men in the small
house, there must be a lot of them.

01:07:38.223 --> 01:07:40.157
It's a warm evening.

01:07:43.711 --> 01:07:48.376
One of our wagons lost a wheel, so we
had to turn back here to get help.

01:07:49.934 --> 01:07:52.359
One of the men tells me,

01:07:53.179 --> 01:07:56.108
the Baxters
attacked the small house.

01:07:57.608 --> 01:07:59.481
Do you know about it?

01:08:03.066 --> 01:08:04.823
Tell me what you know.

01:08:25.202 --> 01:08:26.305
Well?

01:08:27.665 --> 01:08:29.372
Where did you hide Marisol?

01:08:32.350 --> 01:08:33.475
Rubio.

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:02.033
You are thirsty.
You want to drink?

01:09:02.854 --> 01:09:05.759
No, no,
it is too soon to drink.

01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:11.314
Bring him over here!

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:41.728
You are behaving
like a stubborn idiot.

01:09:41.885 --> 01:09:44.314
Tell us where Marisol is,
and it will all be ended!

01:09:44.509 --> 01:09:45.649
In a week,
you'll be back in shape.

01:09:45.716 --> 01:09:48.374
You'll get out and you can go
wherever you want.

01:10:00.014 --> 01:10:01.705
That's enough for today.

01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:05.922
Sooner or later, he'll talk.
It's just a matter of time.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.670
Watch out he doesn't escape or die.
Otherwise, do as you like.

01:10:14.426 --> 01:10:18.151
But wait till he comes to.
This way, he hardly feels anything.

01:10:50.365 --> 01:10:52.825
I've had a poker hand waiting
for me for three days.

01:10:53.012 --> 01:10:56.409
Now I'm stuck here! I can't get to it
while I'm guarding this <i>americano</i> idiot!

01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:58.471
I think you will find this
more amusing than cards.

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:00.857
All orders are to be sure
he does not die,

01:11:00.925 --> 01:11:04.515
and also make sure he regrets
the day he was born.

01:11:06.342 --> 01:11:08.803
The gringo is asleep,
I imagine.

01:11:08.949 --> 01:11:11.942
That's all right.
I'll enjoy waking him up.

01:12:15.806 --> 01:12:19.086
- Esteban, what was that noise?
- I do not know.

01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:21.335
I heard a yell,
and then a crash.

01:12:53.454 --> 01:12:55.388
It's useless to hide.

01:12:57.524 --> 01:12:59.640
You're finished playing
the smart boy.

01:13:01.462 --> 01:13:03.396
Go up
and look in the loft.

01:13:04.958 --> 01:13:07.137
And take a look
behind the barrels!

01:13:18.946 --> 01:13:20.491
Let's get out of here!

01:13:30.893 --> 01:13:33.236
Hurry! Quick!

01:13:33.376 --> 01:13:37.289
Hurry with that water!
Hey, you, come with me!

01:13:51.378 --> 01:13:54.977
Surround the town! Block all
the streets leading out!

01:13:55.115 --> 01:13:57.050
Find him for me!

01:13:58.419 --> 01:14:01.520
Esteban, search the whole town.
Follow me!

01:14:02.889 --> 01:14:06.550
Get him back right now!
You've got to at any cost!

01:14:06.626 --> 01:14:10.439
Look in the stables, in every
corral, in the storeroom!

01:14:10.533 --> 01:14:12.267
Look for him in the church!

01:14:12.477 --> 01:14:15.051
Go in there!
Search every inch of it!

01:14:15.119 --> 01:14:18.709
Search everywhere!
Rubio, in here!

01:14:19.482 --> 01:14:22.270
If somebody is hiding
him, burn their house down,

01:14:22.411 --> 01:14:23.957
and kill them like dogs!

01:14:24.472 --> 01:14:26.089
You, up here!

01:14:26.396 --> 01:14:30.236
Look for him near the Baxters, but
take him alive! I want him alive!

01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:31.968
Alive!

01:14:33.609 --> 01:14:36.163
Rubio, in the bar.

01:15:06.619 --> 01:15:09.839
He says he knows nothing.
He's trying to be smart.

01:15:09.907 --> 01:15:11.516
Bring him here to me.

01:15:13.671 --> 01:15:15.639
I swear,
I'm telling the truth.

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:18.919
Well,
you know nothing, huh?

01:15:19.926 --> 01:15:23.675
- Nothing. I've not seen him.
- Rubio, you take care of him.

01:16:05.119 --> 01:16:06.862
Where have you hidden him?

01:16:08.365 --> 01:16:11.267
I didn't...

01:16:15.755 --> 01:16:18.871
You're the right friend
for that filthy <i>americano</i>.

01:16:19.035 --> 01:16:20.860
And you'll end up
the same way.

01:16:22.057 --> 01:16:23.603
We looked everywhere.

01:16:23.931 --> 01:16:26.696
In his cellar, in the attic,
on the roof.

01:16:26.813 --> 01:16:28.805
But there is no trace.

01:16:29.109 --> 01:16:31.171
I couldn't find anybody there
in the back room.

01:16:31.264 --> 01:16:34.140
I'm certain he has taken
refuge with the Baxters.

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:35.880
The <i>americano</i> isn't stupid.

01:16:35.997 --> 01:16:38.527
He knows that that's the
best place for him to hide.

01:16:40.981 --> 01:16:42.861
The Baxters, eh?

01:16:44.126 --> 01:16:45.743
Then better go and get him.

01:16:50.311 --> 01:16:52.115
And that's for
being his friend.

01:17:26.929 --> 01:17:28.311
Curse them.

01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:35.926
Piripero.

01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:37.495
Eh?

01:17:44.781 --> 01:17:45.929
Piripero.

01:17:57.713 --> 01:18:00.197
- Come here.
- I can't see anybody.

01:18:01.485 --> 01:18:02.586
Come here.

01:18:03.336 --> 01:18:04.812
<i>Dios mio!</i>

01:18:12.332 --> 01:18:14.230
What are you doing in there?

01:18:15.730 --> 01:18:17.626
Never mind.
Get me out of here.

01:18:18.213 --> 01:18:20.345
But you're not dead yet.

01:18:20.509 --> 01:18:23.083
I will be if you don't get
me out of here, quick.

01:18:23.227 --> 01:18:24.585
Get that lid down.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:52.628
Rubio.

01:20:14.673 --> 01:20:16.665
I see some signs of life.

01:20:17.625 --> 01:20:20.085
Let's be ready
when they decide to come out.

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:26.903
Don't shoot!
We surrender!

01:20:26.973 --> 01:20:28.238
Don't shoot!

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:33.486
Stop! Don't shoot!
We're coming out!

01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:39.741
- I'm surrendering! Hold back your fire!
- Don't shoot!

01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:41.756
We're surrendering!

01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:12.142
Stop.

01:21:12.985 --> 01:21:14.883
I wanna take a look at this.

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:55.203
Ramon, don't shoot!
We're coming out!

01:22:58.574 --> 01:23:00.238
We surrender!

01:23:00.376 --> 01:23:03.214
Listen, you've won.
It's enough!

01:23:03.448 --> 01:23:05.880
I'll get out of town!
I'll do whatever you like!

01:23:05.978 --> 01:23:08.555
- You promise that?
- I swear it, Ramon!

01:23:09.185 --> 01:23:11.390
You won't try a trick
of any kind?

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:14.014
None! No, no tricks!

01:23:14.156 --> 01:23:16.685
I said before, I give you my word.
We'll leave!

01:23:16.778 --> 01:23:20.457
Are you sure? You had better
ask permission of your wife.

01:23:22.143 --> 01:23:24.182
Maybe she won't be too happy!

01:23:37.723 --> 01:23:39.013
Antonio!

01:23:40.605 --> 01:23:41.612
John!

01:24:06.492 --> 01:24:07.992
Murderers.

01:24:09.725 --> 01:24:11.670
They had no guns.

01:24:12.279 --> 01:24:15.278
Murderers!
I hope you rot in hell!

01:24:15.348 --> 01:24:17.738
May you and your brothers
die spitting blood!

01:24:17.808 --> 01:24:19.167
Curse you for this!

01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:21.697
Murderers!

01:24:44.141 --> 01:24:46.764
Let's go.
The show's over, anyway.

01:24:51.053 --> 01:24:54.660
Keep looking for him.
Search among those bodies.

01:24:54.957 --> 01:24:57.224
The filthy <i>americano</i>
has to be somewhere!

01:27:16.382 --> 01:27:17.782
Silvanito?

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:24.224
Where's Silvanito?

01:27:27.692 --> 01:27:29.376
Any news today?

01:27:29.636 --> 01:27:32.313
I have to tell you
some news that's pretty bad.

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:36.149
I hate to tell you this, Joe, but...
Where is Silvanito?

01:27:37.344 --> 01:27:41.514
Silvanito, he was captured this
morning by those men of Ramon's.

01:27:41.772 --> 01:27:44.653
They grabbed him outside the village.
He was on his way to this mine.

01:27:44.727 --> 01:27:47.762
He was bringing in some provisions.
Ramon's got him now.

01:27:47.933 --> 01:27:49.901
He's being tortured,
but he won't talk.

01:27:49.995 --> 01:27:51.893
I know him well.
He's a stubborn man.

01:27:52.033 --> 01:27:55.970
No matter what they do, he won't say
a word, even if it means his life.

01:27:56.063 --> 01:27:59.073
Listen to me. They'll never
be able to force him.

01:28:10.402 --> 01:28:13.774
Now, old fool,
loosen up your tongue.

01:28:17.009 --> 01:28:19.327
No.
Rubio!

01:28:21.479 --> 01:28:23.948
You better get back
to your shop, old man.

01:28:24.106 --> 01:28:26.918
- You're liable to have some business.
- Very good!

01:28:26.985 --> 01:28:28.920
That's what
I wanted to hear.

01:28:29.002 --> 01:28:32.223
And I have a little surprise
for you that I brought along.

01:28:32.376 --> 01:28:33.991
I know how much
you are going to need it.

01:28:34.059 --> 01:28:35.960
It was very hard
to get my hands on it.

01:28:36.054 --> 01:28:40.497
But I got it by first using my head.
No one can resist two barrels of wine.

01:28:40.716 --> 01:28:43.176
Isn't that right?
Then I thought that,

01:28:43.293 --> 01:28:47.004
well, you might need that pistol,
and I brought another present.

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:52.711
It's dynamite.
I stole it from the Rojos.

01:28:53.178 --> 01:28:54.378
And now it seems to me

01:28:54.446 --> 01:28:57.280
the moment's come
for you to light the fuse

01:28:57.421 --> 01:28:59.178
and send it back to them.

01:29:18.881 --> 01:29:20.403
Still lots of light.

01:29:24.209 --> 01:29:26.869
Too early to be asleep, yet.

01:29:31.016 --> 01:29:32.469
Rubio, here.

01:29:38.156 --> 01:29:42.493
I shouldn't like to ruin the rifle.
I could never find another like this.

01:29:43.996 --> 01:29:46.736
Listen, Ramon, let's try it
with this one now.

01:31:51.956 --> 01:31:53.716
Gringo!

01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:02.244
Heard you wanted
to see me.

01:32:03.751 --> 01:32:05.711
The <i>americano</i>'s dead.

01:32:07.468 --> 01:32:09.306
Let the old man down.

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:29.420
What's wrong, Ramon?

01:32:30.474 --> 01:32:32.325
You losing your touch?

01:32:40.722 --> 01:32:42.141
Are you afraid, Ramon?

01:32:45.794 --> 01:32:48.256
You shoot to kill,
you better hit the heart.

01:32:50.294 --> 01:32:52.215
Your own words, Ramon.

01:33:08.591 --> 01:33:10.208
The heart, Ramon.

01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:12.453
Don't forget the heart.

01:33:15.774 --> 01:33:18.782
Aim for the heart
or you'll never stop me.

01:34:55.206 --> 01:34:58.820
When a man with a .45
meets a man with a rifle,

01:34:59.429 --> 01:35:01.889
you said the man
with the pistol's a dead man.

01:35:02.967 --> 01:35:04.841
Let's see if that's true.

01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:31.244
Go ahead, load up and shoot.

01:37:36.718 --> 01:37:38.528
Hey, listen, Joe.

01:37:38.953 --> 01:37:42.206
Listen, Joe, I... I...

01:37:43.448 --> 01:37:45.978
Oh, Joe, Joe.

01:38:17.957 --> 01:38:21.729
Well, guess your government will
be glad to see that gold back.

01:38:22.397 --> 01:38:26.579
And you, you don't want to be
here when they get it, eh?

01:38:28.469 --> 01:38:31.311
You mean, the Mexican
government on one side,

01:38:31.573 --> 01:38:33.865
and maybe the Americans
on the other side?

01:38:34.209 --> 01:38:36.043
Me, right smack in the middle?

01:38:37.754 --> 01:38:39.246
Too dangerous.

01:38:40.948 --> 01:38:43.681
- So long.
- <i>Adiรณs</i>.
