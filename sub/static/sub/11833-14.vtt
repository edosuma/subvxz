WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.536
(siren blows)

00:04.838 --> 00:06.673
(door opens)

00:06.707 --> 00:08.775
(door closes)

00:14.080 --> 00:16.650
They're not dismissing.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.418
Well, what about doing
that motion for discovery?

00:18.451 --> 00:20.386
Darryl, we've already --

00:20.420 --> 00:22.355
'Cause they need to discover
that I didn't do this.

00:24.224 --> 00:26.426
The motion for discovery
just asks

00:26.459 --> 00:28.795
for state's evidence,
which we've already done.

00:28.829 --> 00:31.798
What we're talking about now,
Darryl, is the trial.

00:31.832 --> 00:36.069
Oh. Then we need
to do that, right?

00:36.102 --> 00:37.203
'Cause as long
as I'm in here,

00:37.237 --> 00:39.239
well, then my grandmother's
all alone.

00:39.272 --> 00:41.074
She's too sick
to come to court as it is.

00:41.107 --> 00:43.610
I still think our best hope

00:43.644 --> 00:46.212
may be
with mental health issues.

00:46.246 --> 00:47.681
With a borderline I. Q.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.616
and your background
of physical abuse --

00:49.650 --> 00:51.585
I told you before, I don't
want to go to a mental hospital.

00:51.618 --> 00:52.318
I want to go home.

00:52.352 --> 00:55.255
I understand
what you're saying,

00:55.288 --> 00:58.559
I really do,
but if we lose at trial,

00:58.592 --> 01:00.393
you won't get
to go home, either.

01:00.426 --> 01:02.863
But we can't lose
'cause I didn't kill the kid.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.131
Well, unfortunately, it
doesn't always work that way.

01:05.165 --> 01:07.367
But I can tell them
I didn't do it.

01:08.301 --> 01:09.369
Yeah.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.572
Well, I think the prosecution

01:11.605 --> 01:13.306
might ask for more than that.

01:19.312 --> 01:20.180
(door opens)

01:20.213 --> 01:20.881
Forget it.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.183
Richard, he is 17
going on 12.

01:23.216 --> 01:25.318
You had your evaluations.
The kid can stand trial.

01:25.351 --> 01:27.153
Come on, I know
there's a big humanitarian

01:27.187 --> 01:29.122
trapped inside
that little Nazi body.

01:29.155 --> 01:30.557
Oh, yes,
make "little" jokes.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.725
That's very big
of you, Ellenor.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.494
Look, richard, I know you and I
have had our differences.

01:34.528 --> 01:36.663
Ask Brian Tabbitt's parents
what they'd like to work out.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.765
Your client killed their
8-year-old son for sport.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.366
Darryl Hutchins
has the I. Q. --

01:40.400 --> 01:43.704
I am not making any deals.
I'm sorry.

01:45.739 --> 01:46.840
Midget.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.644
(music playing)

02:39.826 --> 02:40.927
Anything?

02:40.961 --> 02:41.895
Nothing.

02:41.928 --> 02:45.331
Was your father beating you?
Because if he was,

02:45.365 --> 02:47.968
we could be talking
self-defense.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.737
Is that what happened?

02:50.771 --> 02:52.606
Your neighbors heard
you and your father

02:52.639 --> 02:53.473
arguing last night.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.209
Someone saw you
running from the house.

02:56.242 --> 03:00.614
If you panicked,
that's totally understandable.

03:00.647 --> 03:02.883
Wendy, look at me.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.851
Look at me.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.720
Let me help you.

03:09.756 --> 03:12.392
You tell me
it was self-defense,

03:12.425 --> 03:16.329
and that's what I write down.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.264
Can I write that down?

03:23.303 --> 03:25.872
I wasn't in the house.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.374
She's not going to talk.
Where's the boyfriend?

03:28.408 --> 03:29.442
Next room.

03:38.018 --> 03:38.952
(door opens)

03:38.985 --> 03:41.688
Listen to me.
If she goes down for murder,

03:41.722 --> 03:44.357
you could be an accessory
before the fact.

03:44.390 --> 03:48.629
That's life in prison.
You ready for that?

03:51.532 --> 03:53.767
That fact that this
just happened last night

03:53.800 --> 03:55.368
could be a big break for you.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.671
Maybe you didn't know
what happened when she called.

03:57.704 --> 03:58.905
Maybe she didn't tell you
till later.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.808
You come forward now, you won't
look like an accessory at all.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.910
I'm not going to talk.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.947
Look, Scott, I could
be your friend here or not.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.850
My dad's a police officer.

04:09.883 --> 04:13.486
I know my rights,
and I want a lawyer.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.555
Who's your dad?

04:14.588 --> 04:16.757
Detective Frank Lopes.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.894
So get me a lawyer.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.400
(door opens)

04:28.735 --> 04:29.736
You heard?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.004
He's Frank's kid?

04:32.372 --> 04:33.039
Any ideas?

04:34.708 --> 04:37.611
Well, we should probably
call Frank.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.412
I think we owe him that.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.848
This will kill him.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.490
I am not commenting
on the facts of the case.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.759
I am merely stating my opinion
that the commonwealth

04:52.793 --> 04:54.561
is turning into a police state.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.930
Darryl Hutchins doesn't have
the mental capacity

04:56.963 --> 04:57.964
to defend himself,

04:57.998 --> 04:59.900
and yet they
push forward anyway.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.769
Why? because Richard Bay
can smell a conviction

05:02.803 --> 05:04.404
going after
the mentally challenged,

05:04.437 --> 05:05.939
and stockpiling convictions

05:05.972 --> 05:07.473
is how assistant
district attorneys

05:07.508 --> 05:10.376
lay pipeline for their
future political careers.

05:11.545 --> 05:14.781
If you think I'll tolerate
any of the nonsense

05:14.815 --> 05:16.550
that went on
in that last trial --

05:16.583 --> 05:17.984
I'm not entitled
to freedom of speech?

05:18.018 --> 05:19.553
That wasn't
about free speech.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.522
That was intended
for the jury.
It was not.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.356
Both of you --
Oh, give me a break,
Ellenor.

05:23.389 --> 05:25.559
They're not sequestered.
She's hoping one or two of them

05:25.592 --> 05:27.127
will catch that little
sound bite on the news.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.429
Look, I am this close
to ordering

05:29.462 --> 05:32.432
that you two never be allowed
in the same courtroom again.

05:32.465 --> 05:35.669
Mr.Bay, take something, please.

05:35.702 --> 05:38.471
Miss Frutt, consider yourself
gagged.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.040
No more talking
take somto the press.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.808
That's all.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.143
(door closes)

05:43.176 --> 05:44.845
You try to agitate me,
Ellenor.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.046
Why can't you
just admit it?

05:46.079 --> 05:47.648
This is a case
we should plead out,

05:47.681 --> 05:48.882
but you
personalize everything

05:48.915 --> 05:50.050
because you need
to beat me, so --

05:50.083 --> 05:51.852
Your client
committed a murder.

05:51.885 --> 05:52.953
D.A.s should take that
personally.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.420
Oh, go away.

05:54.454 --> 05:55.756
Can I ask you
something, Ellenor?

05:56.857 --> 05:58.058
Your guy
picked up a board

05:58.091 --> 06:00.426
and clubbed
an 8-year-old to death.

06:00.460 --> 06:01.528
Does that even bother you?

06:02.963 --> 06:06.032
Or-Or what if you win and put
the 17 going on 12 killer
back out there.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.702
That thought didn't
even give you a twinge?

06:08.735 --> 06:10.671
First of all,
he said he didn't do it.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.707
Oh, well, I didn't know that.
Let's dismiss, then.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.476
Ms. Frutt?
My name's Eddie Chessler.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.744
I'm kind of a friend
of Darryl's.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.714
And?

06:22.583 --> 06:23.784
What can I do for you?

06:24.751 --> 06:26.853
Darryl didn't
kill that kid.

06:28.855 --> 06:31.391
Can we, like,
go someplace, talk?

06:37.798 --> 06:38.965
What's going on?

06:39.566 --> 06:41.602
A man by the name
of Brendon Lowhurst

06:41.635 --> 06:42.836
was found dead
this morning.

06:42.869 --> 06:45.839
What? My son goes out
with his daughter.

06:45.872 --> 06:46.840
We know. He was found

06:46.873 --> 06:49.209
at the bottom of the stairs
with a broken neck.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.913
We think maybe
his daughter pushed him.

06:52.946 --> 06:53.947
Or your son, Frank.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.682
He was seen
fleeing the house.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.117
My son?

06:58.218 --> 06:59.152
What are you nuts?

06:59.185 --> 07:01.822
They're both here
and they're not talking.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.090
Scott's requested a lawyer.

07:05.892 --> 07:06.727
Where is he?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.128
He's in room 3.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.965
I want to talk
to him alone.

07:11.998 --> 07:12.833
No windows.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.868
You have my word.

07:22.543 --> 07:25.145
This kid Kenny --
Kenny Sutton --

07:25.178 --> 07:26.613
he lives
in the neighborhood,

07:26.647 --> 07:28.014
and he's trouble.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.750
I think he killed the boy.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.552
Why?

07:31.585 --> 07:33.987
I was on my way over
to meet him at that old house.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.221
We kind of use it
as a place to hang

07:35.255 --> 07:37.758
since no one
lives there anymore.

07:37.791 --> 07:41.895
I heard a scream from outside
as I was on my way up.

07:41.928 --> 07:44.698
Then I seen Darryl come up,
he goes in.

07:44.731 --> 07:46.633
Then I seen Kenny come out.

07:46.667 --> 07:50.604
I think Kenny killed that boy
before Darryl went in.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.607
Why didn't you tell this
to the police?

07:53.640 --> 07:55.976
'Cause I got to live
in that neighborhood.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.044
You ever spent any time
in Charlestown?

07:58.078 --> 07:59.646
There's a code.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.081
Well, why come forward now?

08:03.083 --> 08:07.688
Well, I guess because I also
got to live with myself.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.191
Are you prepared
to testify to this?

08:11.224 --> 08:13.493
If I have to.

08:14.294 --> 08:17.531
Eddie, you wouldn't
happen to have a grudge

08:17.564 --> 08:19.165
against this Kenny Sutton kid,
would you?

08:19.199 --> 08:21.902
Hey, I'm just telling you
what happened.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.303
All right?

08:23.336 --> 08:25.171
Now, do you want my help
or not?

08:35.015 --> 08:37.984
He has something
he wants to say.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.986
Okay.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.056
We've known each other
a long time, Helen.

08:43.089 --> 08:46.192
I'll do what I can, Frank.

08:48.094 --> 08:50.263
She was crying
when she called.

08:50.296 --> 08:51.965
I asked her
what was wrong,

08:51.998 --> 08:54.300
but she just said,
"he did it again."

08:54.334 --> 08:56.570
I figured he must have
hit her again.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.805
Her father hit her?
Yes.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.273
And this has
happened before?

09:00.306 --> 09:03.544
A few times. I even
told my dad about it.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.247
She tell you
what the fight was about?

09:07.280 --> 09:09.683
It was always about
how she talked back.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.351
He was an ass.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.919
Did she push him
down the stairs?

09:12.953 --> 09:15.856
No. She wasn't even there
when he fell.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.291
She was calling me
from her cell phone.

09:18.324 --> 09:20.694
You know for a fact
she wasn't even there?

09:20.727 --> 09:21.728
Yes.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.597
How do you know?

09:28.635 --> 09:32.305
Because when I went there...

09:32.338 --> 09:35.108
I went alone.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.744
You saw Mr. Lowhurst?

09:37.778 --> 09:40.346
I took my dad's gun
and went to his house.

09:44.685 --> 09:47.153
Okay, and what happened then?

09:47.187 --> 09:49.355
I went upstairs
looking for him.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.391
How'd you get in?
I walked in.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.059
The door wasn't locked.

09:54.661 --> 09:57.063
Then what happened?

09:57.097 --> 09:58.732
He wasn't in his bedroom,

09:58.765 --> 10:01.635
so I went back
into the hallway

10:01.668 --> 10:04.104
just as he's coming out
of the bathroom.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.708
What'd you do?

10:10.143 --> 10:12.846
I pointed the gun at him
and told him

10:12.879 --> 10:15.649
if he ever laid a hand
on Wendy again,

10:15.682 --> 10:17.417
I'd kill him.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.885
I just wanted to scare him,

10:18.919 --> 10:22.288
but he backed up
and fell down the stairs.

10:27.794 --> 10:28.762
At first I thought

10:28.795 --> 10:30.196
he was knocked out,

10:30.230 --> 10:33.767
but then I could tell
he was dead.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.337
I got scared
and ran out.

10:38.204 --> 10:40.173
I swear, Ms. Gamble,

10:40.206 --> 10:42.909
I never, ever
wanted to hurt him.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.845
I just wanted to scare him.

10:49.415 --> 10:51.017
(sobbing)

11:04.364 --> 11:06.800
I can either go to the D. A.,
turn over the new evidence,

11:06.833 --> 11:08.401
ask them to reopen
the investigation --

11:08.434 --> 11:09.102
Richard Bay.

11:09.135 --> 11:10.737
Exactly.
He won't do anything.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.405
You have to add him
to your witness list.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.240
I'm doing that. My question
is do I come clean

11:14.274 --> 11:16.743
with what I've got or do I
just play the card at trial?

11:16.777 --> 11:18.378
Spring it at trial.
Wait a second.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.246
If they investigate and this
guy's story checks out,

11:20.280 --> 11:22.015
you might avoid a trial.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.718
Doesn't sound like he totally
blows the prosecution's case,

11:24.751 --> 11:26.119
and if the trial goes forward,

11:26.152 --> 11:28.021
the less prepared
Richard Bay is --

11:28.054 --> 11:28.922
Unfair surprise.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.757
No, it isn't. The witness
is on the list.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.425
Are you telling them
what the witness will say?

11:32.458 --> 11:34.360
No, just that he was
in the area,

11:34.394 --> 11:35.261
and that he went
into the house

11:35.295 --> 11:36.396
with this Kenny person.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.298
Nothing about hearing screams.
I don't have to tip that.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.800
Unfair surprise.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.134
It is not.
It isn't.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.803
Look, put him
on the witness list.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.104
Let him give his testimony.

11:44.137 --> 11:44.871
Let that be that.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.439
No way do you tip off
Richard Bay.

11:47.107 --> 11:47.974
(door opens)

11:48.008 --> 11:49.976
Bobby, there's a detective
here to see you.

11:50.010 --> 11:50.877
Bobby.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.513
Frank, what's up?

11:52.546 --> 11:53.980
It isn't good.
Can I talk to you?

11:54.014 --> 11:55.882
Sure.
Thanks.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.418
Hey, Eugene,
could you sit in?

11:58.451 --> 12:01.121
Sure.

12:01.454 --> 12:02.923
You let him talk?

12:02.956 --> 12:04.090
He's not a criminal.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.526
I understand, Frank,

12:05.559 --> 12:07.360
but he's facing
criminal charges.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.030
Bobby, I know the way
police think, okay?

12:10.063 --> 12:12.265
You don't talk,
you're a suspect, automatic.

12:12.298 --> 12:15.802
Well, it seems he is anyway.
They going to arraign him?

12:15.836 --> 12:17.337
I don't know on what.
Helen Gamble promised me --

12:17.370 --> 12:19.540
Helen Gamble's the D. A.?

12:19.573 --> 12:21.041
Yeah. She said she might
have to withdraw,

12:21.074 --> 12:22.876
since, you know,
if she's going to help me,

12:22.909 --> 12:23.644
I guess she'd have to.

12:23.677 --> 12:25.211
Frank, she might want
to help you,

12:25.245 --> 12:27.147
but this is a homicide.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.782
It is not going
to slip by quietly,

12:28.815 --> 12:31.818
and D. A. s rarely cut favors
on murder cases.

12:31.852 --> 12:32.919
Trust me on that.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.789
Bobby,
Helen Gamble's here.

12:39.159 --> 12:42.462
(horn blows)

12:42.495 --> 12:44.565
I just found out
about the witness this morning.

12:44.598 --> 12:45.566
Oh, right.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.400
You were there when he
walked up to me, Richard.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.002
What is your offer
of proof?

12:49.035 --> 12:51.237
He was in the area.
He may be no good

12:51.271 --> 12:53.507
to me at all, who knows,
but I'm desperate, okay?

12:53.540 --> 12:54.975
My client doesn't have enough

12:55.008 --> 12:56.577
of an I. Q. to contribute
to his own defense.

12:56.610 --> 12:57.611
Here we go again.
He knows that...

12:57.644 --> 13:00.313
and I should be allowed
to add one lousy witness.

13:00.346 --> 13:01.948
Your Honor,
if I may respond.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.084
No, you may not.
The witness is allowed.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.187
Let's go into court
and get this over with.

13:10.591 --> 13:12.392
It's not
an official objection,

13:12.425 --> 13:14.094
but I think you favor her.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.137
We're charging him
with second-degree murder.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.339
What did you say?

13:26.372 --> 13:28.474
Unfortunately, they're
all over this upstairs.

13:28.509 --> 13:30.043
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Helen.

13:30.076 --> 13:32.245
Second-degree? That's life.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.047
With the possibility
of parole.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.416
You heard it. It was
an accident, for god's sakes.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.985
He's going to go to prison
because of what -- politics?

13:39.019 --> 13:39.853
It isn't politics, Frank.

13:39.886 --> 13:42.523
Helen, you and I
go back pretty good

13:42.556 --> 13:43.489
You look me in the eye

13:43.524 --> 13:44.457
you said you'd do
what you could, and now --

13:44.490 --> 13:48.294
And I am. Frank, when you
brought us in there

13:48.328 --> 13:50.897
for his statement, I thought
he was an accessory at best.

13:50.931 --> 13:53.233
It was an accident. Guy falls
down a flight of stairs,

13:53.266 --> 13:54.868
you bring murder charges?
How is that anything --

13:54.901 --> 13:56.269
He fired the gun.

14:00.607 --> 14:01.942
What?

14:01.975 --> 14:03.376
The gun had been discharged.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.612
We did a trace metal
on Scott. He fired it.

14:05.646 --> 14:08.081
He then dug the bullet
out of the wall

14:08.114 --> 14:11.051
to avoid us finding it.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.986
I'd like to help,

14:13.019 --> 14:15.155
but we've got an armed assault
in a dwelling.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.357
We've got enough
to make first-degree,

14:17.390 --> 14:19.893
in which case
there's no chance of parole.

14:23.129 --> 14:27.133
Murder two's a break,
believe it or not.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.869
I'm sorry.

14:36.242 --> 14:39.445
The victim died
of blunt-force trauma
to the head.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.516
Were you able to determine
the cause of the trauma?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.184
Yes. Wood fragments
were recovered

14:44.217 --> 14:45.251
from the boy's skull,

14:45.285 --> 14:47.453
indicating he had been beaten
with a wooden object.

14:47.487 --> 14:51.457
Did you subsequently determine
the source of those fragments?

14:51.491 --> 14:53.660
They came from a plank

14:53.694 --> 14:55.696
removed from the flooring
of the house

14:55.729 --> 14:57.598
and later recovered
by the officers

14:57.631 --> 14:59.399
in the alley
behind the crime scene.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.205
This would be
the piece of wood?

15:05.238 --> 15:08.942
Yes, and further analysis
found it to be covered

15:08.975 --> 15:11.144
with blood
matching the victim's.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.946
And you tested for prints?

15:12.979 --> 15:15.448
Yes, I performed
a fingerprint analysis

15:15.481 --> 15:18.284
of the latent prints lifted
off that same piece of wood.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.986
And what did
your analysis reveal?

15:20.020 --> 15:21.421
Comparison revealed
those prints

15:21.454 --> 15:24.124
to match the fingerprints
of the defendant.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.527
But it's possible that Darryl
picked up that board

15:26.560 --> 15:28.529
after it had been used
by another person

15:28.562 --> 15:29.395
to murder the victim.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.165
Your client's prints
were the only prints

15:32.198 --> 15:33.499
recovered from the board.

15:33.534 --> 15:34.334
Which would be the case

15:34.367 --> 15:36.236
if the actual perpetrator
wore gloves

15:36.269 --> 15:37.704
or if he wiped
his prints off prior

15:37.738 --> 15:40.140
to my client
handling the board.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.276
True.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.380
I didn't shoot at him,

15:47.413 --> 15:49.650
just to the side
to scare him.

15:49.683 --> 15:53.019
For god's sakes,
why didn't you tell me?

15:53.053 --> 15:55.055
I was afraid
of how it would look.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.022
You aimed the gun --

15:56.056 --> 15:58.592
I shot 6 feet wide of him,
dad, at 4 feet away.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.226
There's no way --
But you lied!

16:00.260 --> 16:01.762
Okay? You lied to me,
you lied to them,

16:01.795 --> 16:04.130
and any chance
of cooperation -- god!

16:04.164 --> 16:05.566
All right, all right.

16:05.599 --> 16:07.768
Yelling's not going
to solve anything.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.670
We need to think.

16:12.773 --> 16:15.542
I didn't shoot at him,

16:15.576 --> 16:18.044
and I didn't push him.

16:18.078 --> 16:21.081
It was an accident.

16:21.114 --> 16:24.284
Well, now what?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.486
He's being arraigned
tomorrow.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.988
After that, we dig in.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.559
He's going to go trial
for murder.

16:32.593 --> 16:35.161
I don't believe this.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.631
There may be
another way to go.

16:37.664 --> 16:38.765
What?

16:38.799 --> 16:40.033
I don't want
to speak too soon.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.535
I-I need to do
a little research,

16:42.836 --> 16:45.371
but we may have an out.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.239
(doors open)

16:46.272 --> 16:47.373
What are you thinking?

16:47.407 --> 16:48.742
Their case
is that confession,

16:48.775 --> 16:50.210
after he asked
for his lawyer.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.378
He confessed to his father.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.213
Who's a cop.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.081
But he didn't confess
to him as a cop.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.382
He was talking to his dad.

16:56.416 --> 17:00.153
That'll be Helen's argument.
Doesn't have to be ours.

17:05.826 --> 17:08.261
He was always
afraid of him.

17:08.294 --> 17:09.229
Your son was afraid...

17:10.195 --> 17:12.232
Of him -- the defendant.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.800
Did he say why?

17:13.834 --> 17:15.234
Not really.

17:15.268 --> 17:18.271
Brian would just say
that he was a little off.

17:18.304 --> 17:19.673
(table slammed)

17:19.705 --> 17:20.607
Mr. Hutchins.

17:20.641 --> 17:21.808
I'm not off!

17:21.842 --> 17:23.108
Darryl.

17:26.880 --> 17:31.117
Mr. Tabbitt, did you
regard your son's fears

17:31.151 --> 17:32.853
to be serious?

17:32.886 --> 17:35.722
Not enough.

17:35.756 --> 17:37.490
I just wish I had
done something --

17:38.525 --> 17:41.427
Gone to his grandmother,
checked him out.

17:41.461 --> 17:42.262
Objection.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.665
How could someone
so clearly disturbed

17:44.698 --> 17:47.233
be on the street,
unsupervised?

17:47.267 --> 17:47.968
How does that work?

17:48.001 --> 17:51.137
Objection.
Sustained. Mr. Bay.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.639
That's all I have.

17:53.674 --> 17:56.209
(gasps)

18:08.321 --> 18:09.255
Brian's fears --

18:10.423 --> 18:14.861
were they caused by Darryl
ever doing anything to your son?

18:14.895 --> 18:16.329
Not that I'm aware of.

18:16.362 --> 18:18.899
It was mainly
Brian got scared

18:18.932 --> 18:22.168
because he perceived Darryl
as being a little off?

18:22.202 --> 18:24.270
Yes.

18:24.304 --> 18:28.408
Thank you. And, sir?

18:29.242 --> 18:31.244
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

18:42.789 --> 18:43.757
So we're winning, right?

18:43.790 --> 18:44.791
It seems like
we're winning.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.293
I wouldn't say that,
Darryl.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.295
I think we are.
You did great, Ellenor.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.867
Darryl, look, um,

18:53.900 --> 18:55.569
I need to talk to you
a little bit more

18:55.602 --> 18:56.703
about this Kenny fellow.

18:56.737 --> 18:58.839
He's cool.

18:58.872 --> 19:02.342
Yes. Are you sure --

19:02.375 --> 19:04.410
absolutely sure that when
you went into the house,

19:04.444 --> 19:06.346
you didn't see Kenny
do anything?

19:06.379 --> 19:09.182
I'm sure.
He was just leaving.

19:09.215 --> 19:11.384
Okay. Eddie Chessler.

19:11.417 --> 19:12.886
Yeah, he's my friend.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.756
Yes, I know that.
Eddie seems to think

19:15.789 --> 19:17.457
that you might be
protecting Kenny

19:17.490 --> 19:22.295
because, well,
you think he's cool.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.229
If you are, Darryl,

19:23.597 --> 19:26.266
that wouldn't be
smart here.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.400
You already told me that.

19:27.433 --> 19:31.371
But I'm not sure
you totally understand it.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.673
If you saw this Kenny kid

19:32.706 --> 19:34.941
do something
to that little boy...

19:36.510 --> 19:38.211
I didn't, I promise.

19:40.313 --> 19:43.449
You think I'm stupid,
don't you?

19:43.483 --> 19:44.918
No, Darryl,
I don't think that.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.853
Yes, you do.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.327
Look, I have to go
meet Eddie

19:54.360 --> 19:55.061
'cause he's up next,

19:55.095 --> 19:57.764
so I want you
to get some rest,

19:57.798 --> 20:02.268
and I'll see you
tomorrow, okay?

20:02.302 --> 20:03.737
Yeah.

20:04.871 --> 20:05.972
Okay.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.644
Ellenor?

20:10.677 --> 20:11.778
Yeah?

20:11.812 --> 20:13.346
I think we're winning.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.688
(door opens)

20:25.491 --> 20:27.528
Okay, tomorrow morning
you're up first.

20:27.561 --> 20:28.494
Are you ready?

20:28.529 --> 20:30.997
Ready. I should just stick
with the same story

20:31.031 --> 20:33.534
I told you, right?

20:33.567 --> 20:35.468
Which is the truth,
right?

20:35.502 --> 20:37.771
You heard the boy scream
before Darryl went in,

20:37.804 --> 20:39.272
and then you saw
that Kenny kid come out?

20:39.305 --> 20:41.041
Got it.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.809
Never mind "got it." Is that
what happened or not?

20:42.843 --> 20:46.379
Look, I can only
put you on the stand

20:46.412 --> 20:48.915
if what you testified to
is the truth.

20:48.949 --> 20:51.317
So what if I just
tell you it's the truth?

20:51.351 --> 20:52.653
You don't know
otherwise for a fact,

20:52.686 --> 20:54.420
and you got no case
without me.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.422
This isn't a game, Eddie.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.358
The rest of Darryl's life
is on the line here.

20:58.391 --> 21:02.629
Which is why I'm here.

21:02.663 --> 21:03.730
What happened? Tell me.

21:03.764 --> 21:05.999
It all happened,
Ms. Frutt.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.835
Darryl went in the house,
Kenny went in the house,

21:08.869 --> 21:10.704
the boy screamed.

21:10.737 --> 21:14.474
I just changed
the order of things.

21:14.508 --> 21:15.876
Just put me up there.

21:15.909 --> 21:18.545
You are not taking the stand.
Go. Just get lost.

21:18.579 --> 21:19.613
What about Darryl?

21:19.646 --> 21:21.882
You have not
helped Darryl, Eddie.

21:21.915 --> 21:23.950
Now get out of here.
You're not testifying.

21:40.767 --> 21:41.868
So, what are you
going to do?

21:41.902 --> 21:45.438
What can I do? I'll have
to put Darryl on the stand.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.139
Darryl?

21:46.172 --> 21:47.708
Have you got
a better idea?

21:47.741 --> 21:51.044
No, but...he has the I. Q.
of a 12-year-old.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.913
You're going to pit him
against Richard Bay?

21:52.946 --> 21:53.847
Even match.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.415
I have no choice.

21:55.448 --> 21:56.617
They've placed him
at the scene.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.084
His prints are
all over the weapon.

21:58.118 --> 22:00.554
If he doesn't get up and tell
his story, he goes away.

22:00.587 --> 22:02.556
Well, you can't still put
Eddie back on the stand?

22:02.589 --> 22:05.726
Knowing he's going to lie?
No, we can't do that, Lucy.

22:05.759 --> 22:09.830
I'm open for suggestions.
Anybody?

22:10.664 --> 22:12.432
Good luck.

22:12.966 --> 22:17.504
Case number 42643,
Commonwealth vs Scott Lopes.

22:17.538 --> 22:18.772
Bobby Donnell for
the defendant, Your Honor.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.641
Waive reading, ask for
personal recognizance.

22:20.674 --> 22:21.474
Murder two.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.043
No flight risk.
This was accidental --

22:23.076 --> 22:25.779
Murder two,
the commonwealth opposes bail.

22:25.812 --> 22:26.880
Bail is denied.

22:26.913 --> 22:29.082
The defense moves to suppress
my client's confession.

22:29.115 --> 22:29.950
Sixth amendment grounds --

22:29.983 --> 22:31.818
he asked for his lawyer
and was denied.

22:31.852 --> 22:33.820
The confession was made
to his own father --

22:33.854 --> 22:35.656
My client's father
is a police officer

22:35.689 --> 22:37.591
who went in to interrogate,
and since Scott Lopes

22:37.624 --> 22:38.458
is his son --

22:38.491 --> 22:39.593
You got to be kidding.

22:39.626 --> 22:42.395
He asked for a lawyer.
They sent in a police officer.

22:42.428 --> 22:43.564
Bobby, even for you...

22:43.597 --> 22:45.498
Helen, even for you...

22:45.532 --> 22:48.401
All right,
what's going on?

22:48.434 --> 22:49.369
It's exactly what I said.

22:49.402 --> 22:51.772
Detective Lopes entered
that room as a father,

22:51.805 --> 22:54.508
not a police officer.
There's no state action here.

22:54.541 --> 22:55.542
And I disagree.

22:55.576 --> 22:58.078
Mr. Donnell, you're suggesting
that detective Lopes

22:58.111 --> 22:59.846
assumed the role
of a police officer

22:59.880 --> 23:01.181
when talking
to his own son.

23:01.214 --> 23:03.550
I request a short evidentiary
hearing, Your Honor.

23:03.584 --> 23:05.752
I'd like to call detective
Michael McGuire to the stand.

23:05.786 --> 23:07.087
What are you trying
to scam now?

23:07.120 --> 23:08.689
I object to that,
but as long as

23:08.722 --> 23:10.524
we're throwing words
like "scam" around...

23:10.557 --> 23:14.460
We're not. The detective
will take the stand at 11:00.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.629
You're joking.

23:17.898 --> 23:19.399
Next case.

23:23.003 --> 23:24.571
Well, I walked up
to the house because

23:24.605 --> 23:26.172
that's where
a lot of us go, you know?

23:26.206 --> 23:27.140
Why's that?

23:27.173 --> 23:27.841
Because there's never
any grownups there.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.910
And when you went
to the house

23:29.943 --> 23:31.545
on this day, Darryl,
what did you see?

23:31.578 --> 23:34.948
I saw my friend Kenny Sutton.
He lives around there.

23:34.981 --> 23:37.651
And was he doing anything?

23:37.684 --> 23:39.886
Just smoking a cigarette,
and then he left.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.822
What happened then?

23:41.855 --> 23:44.958
Then I was going to leave
because no one was there,

23:44.991 --> 23:48.695
but I had to use
the bathroom.

23:48.729 --> 23:51.565
But when I went over
by the stairs,

23:51.598 --> 23:52.633
that's when I saw him.

23:52.666 --> 23:54.167
Who?

23:54.200 --> 23:56.937
Brian Tabbitt.

23:56.970 --> 23:57.971
He was dead.

23:58.004 --> 23:59.873
There was blood everywhere.

23:59.906 --> 24:00.674
And what did you do?

24:00.707 --> 24:02.876
Well, I poked him
a little at first

24:02.909 --> 24:05.646
to see if he was
still alive, but he wasn't.

24:07.581 --> 24:09.516
There was this big piece
of wood on his head,

24:09.550 --> 24:11.552
and I lifted it off.

24:14.287 --> 24:15.656
Was it this piece
of wood here?

24:15.689 --> 24:18.191
Yes, I think that's it.

24:19.960 --> 24:23.597
Darryl, you go to
a special school, am I right?

24:23.630 --> 24:24.565
I'm not stupid.

24:24.598 --> 24:27.668
No, no, you're not.
You go to a special school

24:27.701 --> 24:29.703
because you're
behind the other kids.

24:29.736 --> 24:30.571
Right.

24:30.604 --> 24:31.872
But you do understand,

24:31.905 --> 24:34.040
sitting in this chair
under oath,

24:34.641 --> 24:36.109
it's important
that you tell the truth?

24:36.142 --> 24:37.878
Yes.

24:37.911 --> 24:39.279
Are you telling
the truth now?

24:39.312 --> 24:42.949
Yes, I am.
I didn't kill that boy.

24:42.983 --> 24:46.553
I found him like that.

24:46.587 --> 24:48.855
But you didn't report it
to the police.

24:48.889 --> 24:50.591
I told other people.

24:50.624 --> 24:52.058
Yes, you seem to go around
celebrating it.

24:52.092 --> 24:53.259
Objection -- foundation.

24:53.293 --> 24:54.861
Sustained.

24:55.696 --> 24:57.764
Why didn't you tell
the police?

24:57.798 --> 25:00.200
I told everybody I saw.

25:00.233 --> 25:03.236
If I had seen a policeman,
I would have told him, too.

25:05.305 --> 25:07.741
Ever have any arguments
with Brian Tabbitt, Darryl?

25:07.774 --> 25:09.643
Once in a while.

25:09.676 --> 25:12.546
Was he your friend?

25:12.579 --> 25:14.748
Not really.
He was only 8.

25:14.781 --> 25:17.584
Did he and some of the other
young kids tease you?

25:17.618 --> 25:18.985
Sometimes.

25:19.019 --> 25:21.054
Did he call you a retard?

25:21.087 --> 25:24.791
Sometimes,
but I'm not a retard.

25:24.825 --> 25:26.760
Did you ever tell him
he'd be sorry one day

25:26.793 --> 25:28.795
for calling you a retard?

25:28.829 --> 25:29.996
But I didn't kill him.

25:30.030 --> 25:32.666
Did you hit him?
No.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.000
Did he call you a retard

25:34.034 --> 25:35.702
when you walked
in that house that day?

25:35.736 --> 25:38.672
No, he was already dead.

25:41.942 --> 25:42.943
Nothing further.

25:44.611 --> 25:48.982
Mr. Hutchins, you may go back
to your table now.

25:49.015 --> 25:50.016
Ms. Frutt?

25:50.050 --> 25:51.952
The defense rests,
Your Honor.

25:51.985 --> 25:53.620
Mr. Bay.

25:56.690 --> 25:58.324
One rebuttal witness,
Your Honor.

25:58.358 --> 26:01.795
The commonwealth calls
Eddie Chessler.

26:05.165 --> 26:06.800
Sidebar.

26:09.970 --> 26:12.338
He's properly listed
as a witness.

26:12.372 --> 26:14.307
This is a liar
looking for attention.

26:14.340 --> 26:15.241
How do you know?

26:15.275 --> 26:16.376
Because he was going to lie
to help Darryl.

26:16.409 --> 26:19.012
And As soon as I found out
his story was a fabrication,

26:19.045 --> 26:21.014
I properly excused him
as a witness.

26:21.047 --> 26:23.817
And now he's looking for
his 15 minutes of fame with you.

26:23.850 --> 26:27.387
He didn't come to me,
Ellenor. I went to him.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.155
I saw your little disagreement
in the corridor.

26:29.189 --> 26:31.191
I figured whatever he had
to say didn't help you.

26:31.224 --> 26:32.826
I thought it would help me,
and I was right.

26:32.859 --> 26:34.728
This witness is unreliable.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.129
His testimony could be
prejudicial.

26:36.162 --> 26:37.798
So cross him
on what he told you.

26:37.831 --> 26:39.766
Was anyone else present
for your conversation?

26:39.800 --> 26:41.267
No.

26:41.301 --> 26:43.203
Well, then shame on you.

26:43.236 --> 26:45.939
Never interview a witness
alone. This is what you get.

26:45.972 --> 26:49.810
Thank you, Your Honor.
I was so hoping for a lesson.

26:51.311 --> 26:53.647
I can't prevent him
from testifying.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.348
You are free
to cross-examine.

26:55.381 --> 26:57.250
Let's go.

26:57.918 --> 27:00.887
And at that point,
he asked to see his lawyer.

27:00.921 --> 27:01.922
And then what happened?

27:01.955 --> 27:02.956
We stopped
the interrogation.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.026
Then, since his father was
a colleague, out of courtesy,

27:06.059 --> 27:06.993
we gave him a call.

27:07.027 --> 27:08.094
And then?

27:08.128 --> 27:10.697
His father came down,
went in, and talked to his son.

27:10.731 --> 27:12.365
Then, when Frank emerged,

27:12.398 --> 27:14.935
he said that his son
was ready to make a statement.

27:14.968 --> 27:17.303
Detective, did Scott Lopes
ask to see his father?

27:17.337 --> 27:19.840
Actually, no. He just
asked to see his lawyer.

27:19.873 --> 27:23.276
Whose idea was it
to call detective Lopes?
Helen Gamble's.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.445
Your Honor, at this point,
I'd like to call Helen Gamble.

27:25.478 --> 27:27.347
I'm the prosecuting D. A.

27:27.380 --> 27:29.082
This is just
an evidentiary hearing.

27:29.115 --> 27:31.217
So what? I'm the D. A.
of record. I can't be --

27:31.251 --> 27:32.819
Then maybe you shouldn't be.

27:32.853 --> 27:34.320
What the hell
are you up to now?

27:34.354 --> 27:35.088
Your Honor?

27:35.121 --> 27:39.993
Ms. Gamble,
please take the stand.

27:42.495 --> 27:43.329
And as I was walking,

27:43.363 --> 27:45.398
I was maybe 30 yards
away from the house.

27:45.431 --> 27:46.967
I saw Darryl.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.702
The defendant?

27:48.735 --> 27:49.803
Yes.

27:49.836 --> 27:50.937
And can you tell the court

27:50.971 --> 27:53.039
what you observed next,
Mr. Chessler?

27:53.073 --> 27:55.475
Uh, excuse me.
Before you do,

27:55.509 --> 27:58.278
we should establish
you're here under subpoena,

27:58.311 --> 27:59.345
aren't you, Mr. Chessler?

27:59.379 --> 28:00.446
Yes.

28:00.480 --> 28:03.784
You're in fact a friend
of the defendant, are you not?

28:03.817 --> 28:07.220
I like the guy, yeah.
He's a good kid.

28:07.253 --> 28:10.290
In fact, you were prepared
to lie to help him, weren't you?

28:10.323 --> 28:13.459
I wanted to help him.
I admit that.

28:13.493 --> 28:16.129
You don't have any motive
to hurt him?

28:16.162 --> 28:17.764
No, I don't.

28:17.798 --> 28:20.901
Okay. Continue.

28:20.934 --> 28:25.205
Could you tell us
what happened next?

28:25.238 --> 28:29.275
Well, I seen Darryl
moving towards the house.

28:29.309 --> 28:32.012
Then all of a sudden,
I heard this awful screaming

28:32.045 --> 28:35.315
coming from inside
the house.

28:35.348 --> 28:38.752
You heard the scream
after Darryl went in?

28:38.785 --> 28:42.255
No, no, before he went in.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.857
Darryl was still outside.

28:43.890 --> 28:46.927
He went in after I heard
the screaming.

28:46.960 --> 28:51.932
Mr. Chessler, did you not
tell me earlier

28:51.965 --> 28:53.333
you heard the screaming

28:53.366 --> 28:56.503
after Darryl Hutchins
entered the dwelling?

28:56.537 --> 29:00.373
Yes, I told you that,
but that's not what happened.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.809
The screaming came
before Darryl went in.

29:02.843 --> 29:06.212
Mr. Chessler, why did you
tell Mr. Bay otherwise?

29:06.246 --> 29:08.448
'cause I knew he wouldn't
put me up here

29:08.481 --> 29:09.983
if I was going to tell
the truth.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.251
Objection!
Move to strike!

29:11.284 --> 29:12.485
And I thought the truth
had to come out,

29:12.519 --> 29:14.521
however I could get
to say it.

29:14.555 --> 29:15.455
I've been tricked!

29:15.488 --> 29:18.859
This is a sneaky, sleazy,
disgusting trick.

29:18.892 --> 29:21.027
I'm just saying
what really happened.

29:27.100 --> 29:28.969
Anything else, Mr. Bay?

29:33.273 --> 29:34.508
No.

29:34.541 --> 29:36.242
Ms. Frutt?

29:37.443 --> 29:38.945
Uh, nothing, Your Honor.

29:38.979 --> 29:41.214
The witness may step down.

29:48.989 --> 29:51.958
Mr. Bay, anything else?

29:54.961 --> 29:56.396
Mr. Bay?

30:00.333 --> 30:02.168
We are adjourned
until after lunch,

30:02.202 --> 30:04.404
and then we will hear
closing arguments.

30:07.307 --> 30:08.274
That went well, right?

30:08.308 --> 30:11.011
That went very well.

30:13.113 --> 30:14.247
It was a courtesy.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.449
I've known Frank Lopes
for nine years.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.418
Yes, he is.
He's a friend?

30:18.451 --> 30:20.086
Known him
to be an honest cop?

30:20.120 --> 30:20.954
Very.

30:20.987 --> 30:21.855
Straight shooter?

30:21.888 --> 30:24.625
He shoots straighter
than his son, I guess.

30:24.658 --> 30:27.193
And if his son told him
the truth,

30:27.227 --> 30:29.195
knowing Frank Lopes
the way you do,

30:29.229 --> 30:30.631
what did you think he would
do with the information?

30:30.664 --> 30:33.534
I didn't think about it.
You didn't think about it?

30:33.567 --> 30:34.868
No, I didn't, counsel.

30:34.901 --> 30:37.638
I was just letting
a father visit his son.

30:37.671 --> 30:41.041
Well, you didn't let
the father visit the son

30:41.074 --> 30:42.442
before the police
questioned him.

30:42.475 --> 30:44.611
Only after the boy
asked for his lawyer,

30:44.645 --> 30:46.613
only after you didn't
get anywhere,

30:46.647 --> 30:48.014
then you called
for the dad.

30:48.048 --> 30:49.983
You sent for the father
to get a confession

30:50.016 --> 30:52.318
you couldn't get,
didn't you?
No, I did not.

30:52.352 --> 30:55.556
You're under oath, Helen.
I know my oath, Eugene.

30:55.589 --> 30:57.057
It is your testimony

30:57.090 --> 30:59.325
that when you called
for Scott Lopes' father,

30:59.359 --> 31:00.961
you did not do it
for the purpose

31:00.994 --> 31:02.629
of facilitating
a confession.

31:02.663 --> 31:04.965
That's my testimony.

31:04.998 --> 31:07.400
'Cause you would never
take advantage

31:07.433 --> 31:08.669
of a friend that way,
would you, Helen?

31:08.702 --> 31:10.170
That seems argumentative.

31:10.203 --> 31:12.472
Am I allowed to object
from the chair, Your Honor?

31:12.506 --> 31:15.576
The objection is sustained.
Ask questions, counsel.

31:15.609 --> 31:17.978
Here's a question.

31:18.011 --> 31:20.947
As a friend, why didn't
you have a lawyer present

31:20.981 --> 31:23.617
before getting a statement
from Scott Lopes?

31:24.484 --> 31:25.351
Wouldn't a friend say,

31:25.385 --> 31:27.487
"hey, you might want
to wait for a lawyer"?

31:27.521 --> 31:28.622
Objection -- speculation.

31:28.655 --> 31:31.491
Truth is the Lopeses felt
they were getting legal help,

31:31.525 --> 31:32.959
didn't they, Helen,
from a friend?

31:32.993 --> 31:34.094
Objection --
argumentative.

31:34.127 --> 31:36.963
Tough having to be both
witness and D. A. Here, isn't it?

31:36.997 --> 31:38.364
Tough playing a dual
role, huh, Helen?

31:38.398 --> 31:39.666
Objection -- badgering.

31:39.700 --> 31:42.035
But you weren't playing
a dual role the other day.

31:42.068 --> 31:44.538
You were just a D. A. You sent
that man to get on a mission --

31:44.571 --> 31:45.972
Objection -- badgering!

31:46.006 --> 31:48.942
Are you going to rule
or not?

31:48.975 --> 31:50.476
Move along, Mr. young.

31:50.511 --> 31:52.245
I think I'm done,
Your Honor.

31:52.278 --> 31:56.116
I don't have
any questions at all.

31:56.149 --> 31:57.250
Not anymore.

32:08.028 --> 32:09.462
I don't question
that Frank Lopes

32:09.495 --> 32:11.532
went into that room
as a father, not as a cop.

32:11.565 --> 32:12.666
Then what's the issue?

32:12.699 --> 32:14.968
The issue is
he was used unwittingly

32:15.001 --> 32:16.002
by the district attorney.

32:16.036 --> 32:17.671
She called him
to get a confession.

32:17.704 --> 32:19.740
Regardless what was
in Frank Lopes' mind,

32:19.773 --> 32:22.442
Helen Gamble's thinking
was, "let's use the father

32:22.475 --> 32:24.144
to get the information,"
knowing the father,

32:24.177 --> 32:26.279
a good, straight cop,
would turn it over.

32:26.312 --> 32:27.447
So you're a mind reader now.

32:27.480 --> 32:30.483
Well, Ms. Gamble,
if professional courtesy
was the goal,

32:30.517 --> 32:31.585
why did you
not call the father

32:31.618 --> 32:34.120
before you hit the wall
with the police interrogation?

32:34.154 --> 32:36.657
The police interrogation had
started before I got there.

32:36.690 --> 32:39.059
Scott Lopes
asked for his lawyer.

32:39.092 --> 32:41.294
By law, all questioning
must stop.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.463
And all questioning
did stop.

32:43.496 --> 32:44.397
It was his father,

32:44.430 --> 32:47.433
and on cases where the father
is also a cop,

32:47.467 --> 32:50.370
the courts look to the totality
of circumstances

32:50.403 --> 32:54.340
to determine, "was the statement
given voluntarily?"

32:54.374 --> 32:57.043
Here, it was,
and everyone knows it.

33:02.215 --> 33:03.684
You want to call me
as a witness?

33:03.717 --> 33:05.652
I know what he told you.
You can verify

33:05.686 --> 33:07.621
that his testimony
was a total fabrication.

33:07.654 --> 33:08.622
Are you on drugs?

33:08.655 --> 33:09.790
As a matter of fact,
I am.

33:09.823 --> 33:11.692
I've been pounding aspirin
for three hours.

33:11.725 --> 33:12.859
Mr. Bay.

33:12.893 --> 33:16.697
Your Honor, Eddie Chessler
just proffered false testimony.

33:16.730 --> 33:18.231
She knows it.

33:18.264 --> 33:20.200
You can't call me
to testify

33:20.233 --> 33:22.102
against the interests
of my client.

33:22.135 --> 33:24.270
I believe I can
in the interests of justice.

33:24.304 --> 33:25.639
You can excuse yourself.
He can --

33:25.672 --> 33:26.540
Oh, come on.

33:26.573 --> 33:27.774
Look, what happened here?

33:27.808 --> 33:30.310
I have to admit,
this all seems very strange.

33:30.343 --> 33:33.113
The guy flipped on me,
then he flipped on Richard --

33:33.146 --> 33:34.715
anything to get
into the witness chair.

33:34.748 --> 33:37.250
You didn't
orchestrate this, did you?

33:37.283 --> 33:38.451
I'm sorry?

33:38.484 --> 33:40.153
Oh, how ingenious.

33:40.186 --> 33:41.755
Get the prosecution
to call him.

33:41.788 --> 33:44.457
That way, his testimony
becomes a total bombshell.

33:44.490 --> 33:47.127
Hey, I am the one
who excused his testimony

33:47.160 --> 33:48.028
when I knew
he was going to lie.

33:48.061 --> 33:50.096
Which goes totally
against your character.

33:50.130 --> 33:51.431
Oh, I should've known
something was up

33:51.464 --> 33:52.833
the minute you started
acting ethically.

33:52.866 --> 33:54.367
Have another aspirin.

33:54.400 --> 33:58.639
Your Honor, she has information.
She's a witness.

34:01.708 --> 34:04.310
I'm sorry, Mr. Bay.
I'm not going to allow

34:04.344 --> 34:06.346
the prosecution to call
defense counsel

34:06.379 --> 34:07.614
to impeach
a state's witness.

34:10.116 --> 34:12.152
You got a bad bounce.

34:12.185 --> 34:13.820
You'll just have
to deal with it.

34:13.853 --> 34:14.788
What a gyp!

34:14.821 --> 34:15.822
Excuse me?

34:15.856 --> 34:17.558
This is a total gyp.

34:17.591 --> 34:18.525
Oh, that argument

34:18.559 --> 34:20.827
you'll definitely want
to save for appeal.

34:20.860 --> 34:23.129
For now, let's go.

34:26.867 --> 34:29.168
No eyewitnesses.

34:29.202 --> 34:32.304
Their entire case
is fingerprints,

34:32.338 --> 34:34.574
and you heard
Darryl Hutchins tell you

34:34.608 --> 34:36.543
how those fingerprints
got there.

34:36.577 --> 34:38.545
He picked up
the piece of wood.

34:38.579 --> 34:42.114
Stupid thing to do?
Of course.

34:42.148 --> 34:46.319
But Darryl is a little slower
than the rest of us,

34:46.351 --> 34:48.755
and he just happened
to walk into that house

34:48.789 --> 34:50.757
at the wrong time.

34:50.791 --> 34:53.393
And you heard
Eddie Chessler's testimony.

34:53.426 --> 34:55.395
He said he heard the scream

34:55.428 --> 34:57.397
before Darryl went
into that building --

34:57.430 --> 35:01.234
before he went in.

35:01.267 --> 35:02.903
And what about
this Kenny Sutton?

35:02.936 --> 35:04.671
Why wasn't he called?

35:04.705 --> 35:08.408
Why wasn't he put on the stand
to say that Brian Tabbitt

35:08.441 --> 35:10.744
was still alive
when he left the building?

35:10.777 --> 35:14.648
There is reasonable doubt
everywhere you turn on this one.

35:14.681 --> 35:17.651
Eddie Chessler is a liar
who tricked his way

35:17.684 --> 35:20.253
onto the stand
in order to help a friend.

35:20.286 --> 35:21.622
The defense couldn't call him

35:21.655 --> 35:23.256
since they knew him
to be a liar.

35:23.289 --> 35:23.924
Objection.

35:23.957 --> 35:28.829
JUDGE KITTLESON:
Sustained.

35:28.862 --> 35:33.466
You know, it's easy
to fall into the trap

35:33.499 --> 35:38.371
of looking at trials
with a scorecard --

35:38.404 --> 35:40.306
who built up the most points,

35:40.340 --> 35:42.375
who won the day, who lost --

35:42.408 --> 35:44.878
like it's a game.

35:44.911 --> 35:48.348
As I stood here
in this room yesterday,

35:48.381 --> 35:50.684
egg all over my face,

35:50.717 --> 35:53.887
I'm sure I looked every bit
the loser I felt I was.

35:53.920 --> 35:56.590
Imagine my embarrassment,

35:56.623 --> 36:00.260
being surprised
by my own witness.

36:00.293 --> 36:02.563
But this isn't a game,
ladies and gentlemen.

36:02.596 --> 36:04.565
You don't go back
to that room

36:04.598 --> 36:06.967
and decide who racked up
the most points.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.903
The question is,
who killed Brian Tabbitt?

36:11.838 --> 36:14.374
Other than the untruthful
testimony of Eddie Chessler,

36:14.407 --> 36:20.346
the evidence -- all of it --
points to Darryl Hutchins.

36:20.380 --> 36:22.883
He threatened the boy.
He was alone with him
in a house.

36:22.916 --> 36:26.887
When Mr. Hutchins left,
Brian Tabbitt was dead,

36:26.920 --> 36:28.321
with the defendant's
fingerprints

36:28.354 --> 36:31.558
all over the weapon.

36:31.592 --> 36:36.530
For once, let's not
look at this as a game.

36:36.563 --> 36:38.732
Let's hold a killer
responsible.

36:50.944 --> 36:54.347
We've had parents
extract confessions before

36:54.380 --> 36:57.751
and the test has always been was
the parent acting as a parent,

36:57.784 --> 36:59.753
or, rather, as an agent
of the state

36:59.786 --> 37:01.922
when speaking with his or her
arrested child?

37:01.955 --> 37:04.558
Nobody here
seems to be doubting

37:04.591 --> 37:07.427
detective Lopes
went into that room as a father,

37:07.460 --> 37:09.663
not as a police officer,

37:09.696 --> 37:13.800
but to me, the question
doesn't end there.

37:13.834 --> 37:17.370
Anything designed to elicit
an incriminating response

37:17.403 --> 37:22.308
by definition
is an interrogation.

37:22.342 --> 37:23.910
Therefore, Ms. Gamble,

37:23.944 --> 37:25.546
if you sent the father
into that room

37:25.579 --> 37:27.581
as part of a design
to collect information,

37:27.614 --> 37:30.483
the court holds that
to be an interrogation,

37:30.517 --> 37:35.556
even if the father was
an unwitting participant.

37:35.589 --> 37:41.427
The question here is
what was in your mind?

37:41.461 --> 37:43.697
Only you know.

37:43.730 --> 37:45.632
The court, however,
is allowed to take note

37:45.666 --> 37:47.701
of your competitive reputation.

37:47.734 --> 37:50.504
The court also takes note

37:50.537 --> 37:52.506
that detective Lopes never
would have entered that room

37:52.539 --> 37:55.475
unless you sent for him,
and since you sent for him

37:55.509 --> 37:58.845
after you struck out
with the police interrogation,

37:58.879 --> 37:59.913
and since the defendant

37:59.946 --> 38:02.849
had invoked his right
to counsel,

38:02.883 --> 38:04.818
I smell a foul ball.

38:07.487 --> 38:10.456
The confession is suppressed.
The gun and the bullet

38:10.490 --> 38:11.692
are deemed fruits
of the poisonous tree

38:11.725 --> 38:15.028
and are similarly suppressed.
In the absence of this evidence,

38:15.061 --> 38:16.663
I find no cause to hold
the defendant,

38:16.697 --> 38:19.065
and he is therefore
free to go.

38:19.099 --> 38:20.400
Adjourned. [ bangs gavel ]

38:23.937 --> 38:24.971
Thank you.

38:25.005 --> 38:28.041
Thank you. I have to admit,
I hate what you guys do,

38:28.074 --> 38:29.042
but I love it today.

38:31.778 --> 38:34.447
Would Your Honor have
a big long stick handy,

38:34.480 --> 38:36.717
preferably barbed?

38:36.750 --> 38:37.718
I'm sorry?

38:37.751 --> 38:39.953
I'd like to bend over
and have it run up my ass

38:39.986 --> 38:44.991
to complete the experience
of appearing before you.

38:45.025 --> 38:49.530
I'll let that go,
counsel...once.

38:53.734 --> 38:55.936
I won't let it go,
Helen.

38:55.969 --> 38:58.505
You sent me in there
to do your work

38:58.539 --> 38:59.706
with my own son.

38:59.740 --> 39:01.775
Come on, Frank. Come on.

39:12.519 --> 39:14.655
I think we did really good,
don't you, Ellenor?

39:14.688 --> 39:16.790
We'll know in a second,
Darryl.

39:16.823 --> 39:21.061
And if we win, I get to go home
to my grandma, right?

39:21.094 --> 39:22.128
That's right.

39:22.162 --> 39:25.699
Members of the jury
have you reached a verdict?

39:25.732 --> 39:26.733
We have.

39:26.767 --> 39:31.104
Will the defendant
please rise.

39:31.137 --> 39:32.639
What say you?

39:32.673 --> 39:35.141
On the charge of murder
in the first degree,

39:35.175 --> 39:37.511
we find the defendant
Darryl Hutchins

39:38.745 --> 39:40.413
not guilty.

39:40.446 --> 39:43.049
On the charge of murder
in second degree,

39:43.083 --> 39:45.485
we find the defendant
Darryl Hutchins

39:46.953 --> 39:48.054
not guilty.

39:49.990 --> 39:51.091
Unbelievable.

39:52.158 --> 39:54.595
JUDGE KITTLESON:
The defendant is free to go.

39:54.628 --> 39:56.129
Members of the jury,
you are dismissed

39:56.162 --> 39:57.130
with the court's thanks.

39:57.163 --> 39:59.199
We are adjourned.

39:59.232 --> 40:00.734
You did it, Ellenor.
You did it.

40:01.702 --> 40:02.836
I think you can thank
your friend Eddie.

40:03.504 --> 40:05.639
He helped, too.

40:07.774 --> 40:10.944
It was my idea,
you know.

40:10.977 --> 40:11.978
I'm sorry?

40:12.012 --> 40:13.547
I knew if he testified
for me,

40:13.580 --> 40:16.482
the jury would only,
like, half believe him,

40:16.517 --> 40:19.953
but if he was
a prosecution witness...

40:19.986 --> 40:22.889
You told him to do that?

40:22.923 --> 40:24.958
I told you
I wasn't stupid.

40:24.991 --> 40:27.628
I told you
I wasn't a retard.

40:28.962 --> 40:30.697
No, you're not, Darryl.

40:33.534 --> 40:35.135
Well, I'm going to go
see my grandmother,

40:35.168 --> 40:36.937
'cause I know
she misses me.

41:01.628 --> 41:03.664
(indistinct chatter)

41:03.697 --> 41:05.999
I want to quit.

41:06.032 --> 41:07.233
You can't quit.

41:07.267 --> 41:09.069
I need you to talk me
out of quitting.

41:12.773 --> 41:13.807
Why is it getting so hard

41:13.840 --> 41:15.008
to get convictions
these days?

41:15.041 --> 41:18.144
Because people are becoming
more distrustful of the police,

41:18.178 --> 41:19.279
and D. A. s --
we don't have

41:19.312 --> 41:21.682
the presumption
of integrity anymore.

41:21.715 --> 41:23.650
But why?
I don't understand.

41:23.684 --> 41:26.252
Tell me. Did you send
the father in there

41:26.286 --> 41:27.988
for the purpose of getting
the kid's confession?

41:28.021 --> 41:30.724
Yes.

41:30.757 --> 41:34.595
So? If he were innocent,

41:34.628 --> 41:36.229
there'd be no confession
to be had.

41:38.599 --> 41:39.733
Can I have your pickle?

41:56.349 --> 41:59.052
I need it, Richard.

41:59.085 --> 42:00.954
Give it to me.

42:00.987 --> 42:01.755
What?

42:01.788 --> 42:04.224
The speech --
why we do what we do.

42:04.791 --> 42:07.160
Oh, I am not really
in the mood after the --

42:07.193 --> 42:08.929
Oh, please, Richard,
I need it.

42:09.863 --> 42:12.165
Please give it to me,
and don't just phone it in.

42:12.799 --> 42:13.700
Helen.

42:13.734 --> 42:17.070
Please. Can't you see
how demoralized I am?

42:20.707 --> 42:21.775
Okay.

42:25.746 --> 42:27.347
There are heroes
in this world.

42:27.380 --> 42:29.716
They're called
district attorneys.

42:29.750 --> 42:31.051
They don't get
to have clients,

42:31.084 --> 42:33.987
people who smile at them
at the end of the trial,

42:34.020 --> 42:36.823
who look them in the eye
and say, "thank you."

42:36.857 --> 42:38.859
Nobody's there to appreciate
the district attorney

42:38.892 --> 42:41.194
because we work for the state,

42:41.227 --> 42:43.229
and our gratitude
comes only from knowing

42:43.263 --> 42:45.966
there's a tide out there --

42:45.999 --> 42:47.200
a tide the size of a tsunami

42:47.734 --> 42:49.970
coming out
of a bottomless cesspool,

42:50.003 --> 42:53.106
a tide called crime,
which, if left unchecked,

42:53.139 --> 42:56.877
will rob every American
of his freedom,

42:56.910 --> 42:59.279
a tide which strips
individuals of the privilege

42:59.312 --> 43:01.782
of being able to walk
down a dark street

43:01.815 --> 43:03.817
or to take $20
out of an atm machine

43:03.850 --> 43:05.185
without fear of being mugged.

43:05.218 --> 43:07.253
All Congress does is talk,

43:07.287 --> 43:09.923
but it's the district attorney
who grabs his sword,

43:09.956 --> 43:12.793
who digs into the trenches
and fights the fight,

43:12.826 --> 43:16.963
who dogs justice day after day
after day without thanks,

43:16.997 --> 43:18.799
without so much
as a simple pat on the back,

43:18.832 --> 43:20.133
but we do it. We do it.

43:20.166 --> 43:23.236
We do it because
we are the crusaders,

43:23.269 --> 43:25.639
the last frontier
of American justice,

43:25.672 --> 43:27.207
knowing that if a man
cannot feel safe,

43:27.240 --> 43:30.844
he can never, never
feel free.

43:38.018 --> 43:39.820
Thank you.

43:41.021 --> 43:42.088
What about your other pickle?

43:55.769 --> 43:57.738
(music playing)

44:22.095 --> 44:23.096
You stinker!
