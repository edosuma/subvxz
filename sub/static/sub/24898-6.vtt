00:12.268 --> 00:13.323
Church on time!

00:13.348 --> 00:15.116
Hey man, where's your plus one?

00:15.271 --> 00:17.072
Oh, that's right, you're the plus one.

00:17.106 --> 00:20.256
That's gotta be weird being
someone's substitute plus one.

00:20.281 --> 00:22.773
It's not weird at all.
Boyfriend Rick had to work.

00:22.968 --> 00:25.213
Sam doesn't like it when you
call Rick boyfriend Rick.

00:25.248 --> 00:26.682
He is her boyfriend isn't he?

00:26.856 --> 00:27.869
Kinda.

00:28.284 --> 00:29.588
You ever hang out with him?

00:30.143 --> 00:34.222
Uh, Sam and I just recently
rediscovered hanging out, so no.

00:34.257 --> 00:35.891
But you're both with the bride.

00:35.925 --> 00:37.392
I just play softball with her,

00:37.427 --> 00:39.328
but Sam kinda big sistered Melissa.

00:39.362 --> 00:41.743
Met her when she had to
arrest Melissa's dad.

00:42.140 --> 00:44.500
- What's the story there?
- I just told it.

00:44.801 --> 00:45.801
Hey, where is Sam?

00:45.835 --> 00:47.669
She's still bridesmaiding,
I haven't seen her.

00:47.704 --> 00:49.515
- Uh, don't-don't look over there.
- Don't look where?

00:49.539 --> 00:50.609
Don't make eye contact.

00:51.077 --> 00:52.085
- Oh...
- Don't loo...

00:52.110 --> 00:54.545
Blue dress, four o'clock, super cute?

00:54.644 --> 00:56.241
That ship has already sailed.

00:56.546 --> 00:57.666
Tell me everything.

00:58.848 --> 01:01.352
We kinda slept together.

01:01.377 --> 01:03.293
When you say 'kinda slept together',

01:03.318 --> 01:05.643
you mean it resembled sex,
but it was kinda something else,

01:05.668 --> 01:07.051
cause I really wanna know what that is.

01:07.075 --> 01:08.976
It was full-on, yeah.

01:09.753 --> 01:14.089
The only problem is,
I kinda went full-on with her mother,

01:14.460 --> 01:16.093
which I didn't know until I sat down

01:16.118 --> 01:19.273
for a very very weird family breakfast.

01:19.298 --> 01:21.599
Please tell me mom is here today.

01:21.714 --> 01:23.664
Oh thank God, no, I think she's um...

01:27.618 --> 01:29.953
Yep, she's here too.

01:30.069 --> 01:32.044
Oh, really cute as well.

01:32.069 --> 01:35.283
Now we know what an episode of
The Dave Lee Show looks like.

01:35.385 --> 01:36.807
You know what? We should stretch.

01:36.832 --> 01:39.401
Yeah, no, let's stretch,
we've been sitting a whole two minutes

01:39.426 --> 01:40.888
I'm starting to cramp up.

01:44.536 --> 01:46.778
Hey fellas what's up? Bride or groom?

01:47.430 --> 01:48.473
Yes.

01:50.020 --> 01:51.819
Wedding crashers, wow.

01:52.020 --> 01:54.412
You should introduce
them to your girlfriends.

01:54.437 --> 01:55.888
Okay, calm down.

01:56.339 --> 01:58.566
- Hey Dave.
- Adam, how's it going man?

01:58.591 --> 01:59.878
Not gonna lie, a little nervous.

01:59.903 --> 02:01.385
Yeah, Adam, this is Harley Carter.

02:01.410 --> 02:03.736
- Uh, yeah, no duh, hey.
- What's going on, man?

02:03.761 --> 02:05.379
Thank you so much
for having me. Congrats.

02:05.403 --> 02:08.132
Are you kidding? I mean, this day's
already bordering on 100% surreal,

02:08.156 --> 02:09.256
now Harley Carter's here?

02:09.281 --> 02:11.950
I'm the plus one of one of
your bridesmaids; Sam Shaw.

02:11.975 --> 02:13.072
Yeah, I know. Still.

02:13.833 --> 02:17.048
Hey, Sam told me you work
with Doctors Without Borders.

02:17.073 --> 02:18.540
That's extremely cool, man.

02:18.571 --> 02:20.494
Uh it's mostly just carrying
a stretcher, so...

02:21.030 --> 02:23.632
- Sorry to interrupt, but uh...
- Right, the wedding.

02:23.850 --> 02:25.934
Your bride to be told me she wanted me

02:25.968 --> 02:28.770
to include her middle
names in the ceremony.

02:28.899 --> 02:29.977
Do you wish the same?

02:30.192 --> 02:31.195
Sure.

02:31.220 --> 02:34.808
She said your full name is
Adam Mikail Albek Khamza?

02:35.346 --> 02:36.488
Am I saying that right?

02:36.656 --> 02:38.574
Perfect. Let's do this.

02:38.638 --> 02:40.285
That's the spirit, go get 'em tiger.

02:40.322 --> 02:42.276
Go get 'em Adam Mikail.

02:43.886 --> 02:45.643
So are you ready for this?

02:45.778 --> 02:48.184
Put me like a seal over your heart.

02:48.768 --> 02:50.645
Like a seal on your arm.

02:51.327 --> 02:55.897
For love is as strong as death,
jealousy is as severe as Sheol;

02:56.132 --> 02:58.300
It's flashes are flashes of fire,

02:58.538 --> 03:01.017
the very flame of the Lord.

03:05.432 --> 03:07.099
Oh, she looks so beautiful.

03:09.312 --> 03:11.113
- Grow up.
- I didn't say anything...

03:12.123 --> 03:14.166
About how beautiful Sam looks.

03:39.896 --> 03:40.963
Everybody down!

03:55.279 --> 03:56.291
Dammit.

Coordinate with Sanders and Chelios.

04:34.111 --> 04:36.866
I want perimeters set up
on the 94 and the 121,

04:36.891 --> 04:39.586
and nobody leaves here until
you've heard from me or the chief.

04:40.380 --> 04:41.470
How's he doing, Rick?

04:41.626 --> 04:43.423
- I got lucky.
- He got lucky.

04:43.743 --> 04:45.350
Is he okay to move to the station?

04:45.385 --> 04:46.470
Yeah, he should be fine.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.193
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, how's he doing?

04:49.218 --> 04:51.232
We gotta take him to
General, broken hip.

04:51.257 --> 04:53.109
I mean, it's amazing
nobody got killed in here.

04:53.159 --> 04:55.561
Well, I don't think they
were expecting Wonder Woman

04:55.586 --> 04:57.180
as one of their bridesmaids.

04:57.735 --> 04:59.198
Thanks for subbing in for me, man.

04:59.391 --> 05:01.200
Not a problem, it was
a beautiful ceremony,

05:01.234 --> 05:03.368
until the shooting started.

05:06.072 --> 05:07.359
- I gotta run.
- Okay.

05:07.384 --> 05:09.585
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:11.248 --> 05:12.715
Hey, you guys good?

05:12.812 --> 05:14.443
There's still a shooter out there.

05:14.468 --> 05:17.506
Yeah, uh... about that, um,
I think I'm gonna make sure

05:17.531 --> 05:21.030
Miranda and her mom get home safe...

05:23.089 --> 05:24.802
It's just a drive, okay?

05:24.827 --> 05:26.108
Get your head outta the gutter.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.226
Call me later, yeah?

05:27.815 --> 05:28.915
I will.

05:31.163 --> 05:33.088
Alright, bride and groom
are gonna come with us.

05:33.113 --> 05:35.043
Right, what about the guy
who filmed the whole thing?

05:35.067 --> 05:36.934
Yeah, and the Reverend said
he got a pretty good look

05:36.958 --> 05:38.744
at the guy who got
away, so he comes too.

05:41.537 --> 05:43.140
- Let's be elsewhere.
- Yeah.

05:48.239 --> 05:49.901
_

05:50.058 --> 05:52.581
_

05:58.635 --> 06:00.226
_

06:00.251 --> 06:02.601
_

06:03.396 --> 06:04.749
_

06:06.341 --> 06:07.714
_

06:19.311 --> 06:20.378
What's going on, detective?

06:20.819 --> 06:22.253
Process him.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.810
You guys just make an
appointment for round two?

06:27.835 --> 06:29.202
Don't tempt me.

06:31.381 --> 06:32.998
- What's happening?
- What's happening is we got

06:33.022 --> 06:34.967
a possible hostage
situation at the hospital.

06:35.193 --> 06:36.370
- What?
- You know what I know,

06:36.394 --> 06:37.675
we got a call that shots were fired

06:37.699 --> 06:39.972
and now I got two units down
there barking about hostages.

06:39.996 --> 06:41.704
Two different shootings
in the span of an hour?

06:41.728 --> 06:43.922
Oh, I know, and apparently
this severe thunderstorm

06:43.947 --> 06:46.181
has just been upgraded
to storm of the century.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.443
- You're in charge.
- Got it.

06:47.777 --> 06:49.014
Oh, and one more thing...

06:49.039 --> 06:50.233
Listen, this rain isn't gonna let up,

06:50.257 --> 06:51.873
which means the river is going to crest,

06:51.898 --> 06:53.608
which means we're likely
going to lose power,

06:53.632 --> 06:54.881
and the bridges into downtown.

06:54.906 --> 06:56.372
Alright, well, let me
settle these witnesses

06:56.396 --> 06:57.552
and then I'll take a crack
at the guy we caught.

06:57.576 --> 06:58.643
Right, break 'em hard and fast,

06:58.667 --> 07:00.521
I wanna find out who's
shooting up our town and why.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.932
And preferably before they hit somebody.

07:02.957 --> 07:04.322
- Yeah.
- Let's move out.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.570
Hey, uh, sorry, I didn't get your name.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.628
Keller.

07:09.662 --> 07:11.607
Keller, hey, I'm Harley,
we're gonna need

07:11.632 --> 07:13.325
to look at your footage on your camera.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.410
I spent $4,000 on my camera.

07:16.435 --> 07:19.064
I'm not asking to buy it, I'm asking
to take a look at the footage.

07:19.088 --> 07:21.023
Harley, you got a visitor.

07:21.384 --> 07:22.619
Said she was your wife.

07:34.402 --> 07:35.636
What are you doing here?

07:35.717 --> 07:37.127
I could ask you the same thing.

07:37.259 --> 07:38.266
I'm on the job.

07:38.330 --> 07:40.872
Oh right, right, Dot told me

07:40.897 --> 07:42.865
that you were pretending to work here.

07:42.890 --> 07:44.624
Okay, no, what are you doing here?

07:44.650 --> 07:46.817
Like I had any other choice.

07:46.850 --> 07:49.042
You did, you had a
million other choices.

07:49.067 --> 07:50.418
Here's a good one off
the top of my head...

07:50.442 --> 07:52.775
- How 'bout you not be here?
- Oh, don't be a dick.

07:53.205 --> 07:55.901
You know what, Winter? I don't have
time for this right now, I don't.

07:55.925 --> 07:57.573
Really? Why? Huh?

07:57.670 --> 07:58.684
What's happening?

07:58.709 --> 08:01.087
There was a shooting,
multiple shootings,

08:01.112 --> 08:02.292
which I'm sure we can all drop

08:02.316 --> 08:03.955
now that the Winter show is here.

08:03.980 --> 08:06.064
You do not get to play it this way,

08:06.089 --> 08:08.875
not after sending me this!

08:11.546 --> 08:15.489
Can we go somewhere private?

08:16.662 --> 08:18.897
This is the most private
area in the building.

08:18.931 --> 08:20.790
In fact it's my favourite
area in the building.

08:20.981 --> 08:22.011
Right here.

08:22.768 --> 08:26.171
Fine, have it your way,
let's just talk right here

08:26.626 --> 08:28.372
about why we haven't spoken

08:28.483 --> 08:30.915
since you caught me in
bed with another man!

08:43.386 --> 08:44.419
That was classy.

08:44.444 --> 08:46.847
Well, I'm not classy Harley,
you used to like that about me.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.411
You know what else I
used to like about you

08:48.435 --> 08:49.825
is when you didn't
sleep with my friends.

08:49.849 --> 08:51.083
I found that really appealing.

08:51.108 --> 08:54.457
I wanna talk about it,
but you won't answer any of my calls,

08:54.482 --> 08:55.949
or my texts, or my e-mails.

08:55.974 --> 08:58.694
And then you just send me
divorce papers out of nowhere?

08:58.719 --> 09:01.061
Out of nowhere? Winter, are
you being serious right now?

09:01.086 --> 09:02.365
This conversation is over.

09:02.390 --> 09:04.147
No, Harley...

09:07.805 --> 09:12.626
I just wanted a chance to apologize.

09:14.297 --> 09:15.797
We're beyond apologies, Winter.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.465
I know, I know, I know, I know.

09:18.490 --> 09:20.205
I just... Harley,

09:20.230 --> 09:24.623
I know that apologizing is... nothing.

09:25.763 --> 09:29.674
I just, I didn't know
where else to start.

09:30.419 --> 09:32.032
I didn't know what else to do.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.855
You wanna do something, Winter?

09:34.049 --> 09:35.100
Sign the papers.

09:35.125 --> 09:37.860
You know that signing the papers
is not gonna fix anything.

09:38.010 --> 09:40.145
We're beyond a fixable situation here.

09:40.179 --> 09:42.274
Okay look, I know I screwed up, okay?

09:42.515 --> 09:44.583
I made a huge mistake, the hugest.

09:45.685 --> 09:48.380
But it can't end like this.

09:49.789 --> 09:54.330
Look, if we apologize...

09:56.128 --> 09:57.829
- If we apologize?
- I meant me.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.931
We apologize, as if I
had something to do

09:59.966 --> 10:01.876
- with you cheating one me?
- No-no-no...

10:01.901 --> 10:03.852
- If that was somehow my fault...
- No-no!

10:03.877 --> 10:06.059
Winter, please, just sign the papers.

10:06.084 --> 10:08.540
I just meant that there are
things that we could both say,

10:08.574 --> 10:10.152
that we could talk about.

10:10.783 --> 10:14.408
Winter, listen, I'm in a situation
right now where-where people

10:14.433 --> 10:17.482
are shooting at other people,
and it's really serious.

10:18.074 --> 10:19.132
Fine.

10:19.246 --> 10:20.334
Fine.

10:21.153 --> 10:22.587
You do you, Harley.

10:31.564 --> 10:32.632
Ugh!

10:32.657 --> 10:34.485
- Where'd you come from?
- You want more?

10:34.526 --> 10:37.144
No, Dot, you gotta stop
slapping me in public.

10:37.169 --> 10:38.731
Then grow up.

10:39.505 --> 10:41.415
I've had so many weird
conversations today...

10:41.440 --> 10:42.810
What are you trying to tell me?

10:42.835 --> 10:46.138
It takes two to tango,
and three to have an affair.

10:46.212 --> 10:47.846
Again, confusing.

10:47.989 --> 10:50.233
If you had divorced her
when I told you to,

10:50.383 --> 10:51.883
none of this would have happened.

10:51.918 --> 10:54.058
You told me to divorce her
at our wedding reception.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.488
And now here we are.

10:55.788 --> 10:56.886
Who was right?

10:56.918 --> 10:59.724
Dot, just take her to
a motel or something.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.159
Have you looked outside?

11:01.193 --> 11:02.761
No one is going anywhere.

11:02.795 --> 11:05.748
Stop being baby Harley, deal with it.

11:16.362 --> 11:19.333
Four guys walk into the hospital,
start asking questions.

11:19.914 --> 11:22.686
Security guard spots a gun
under one of their coats,

11:22.711 --> 11:23.742
calls them out.

11:23.968 --> 11:25.034
Was anyone hurt?

11:25.312 --> 11:27.170
No, not yet, but we got
the shooters cornered

11:27.204 --> 11:28.905
in the basement, but
they've got hostages

11:28.939 --> 11:30.380
that we've got no eyes on.

11:30.741 --> 11:32.976
The tactical team has been
called in from Barry...

11:33.010 --> 11:35.211
The 11 is closed and the 10th line road.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.751
Yeah, the 10th, the 12th,
and McGinley side road.

11:37.776 --> 11:40.071
Look, try to get something
out of your shooter,

11:40.096 --> 11:42.094
I need to know what
we're dealing with, now.

11:42.119 --> 11:44.668
On it. Can you send over the
security footage from the hospital?

11:44.815 --> 11:46.941
Done. Look, you guys still have power?

11:47.496 --> 11:49.971
For now, but I sent Rafalski
to top off the generator,

11:49.996 --> 11:51.723
and we're out of gas,
so we're running on fumes.

11:51.747 --> 11:53.215
Yeah, we're on a genny too.

11:53.240 --> 11:54.707
Look, I'll send you that footage.

11:54.732 --> 11:56.108
Oh, look, one last thing.

11:56.343 --> 11:58.311
The security guard says the four guys

11:58.336 --> 12:00.743
at the hospital are speaking Russian.

12:02.387 --> 12:04.233
- Keep in touch.
- Will do.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.123
Sam, Adam's with
Doctors Without Borders.

12:07.428 --> 12:10.018
Let's put that on the list
of things to ask Adam.

12:10.043 --> 12:11.523
I think these guys are the same guys.

12:11.702 --> 12:13.114
They didn't get Adam at the church.

12:13.139 --> 12:14.263
They thought he was at the hospital.

12:14.287 --> 12:15.720
I'm thinking the same thing.

12:17.421 --> 12:18.919
Harley, is your head in the game?

12:20.074 --> 12:22.419
- Always.
- It seemed tense, your wife and you.

12:23.107 --> 12:25.027
Well, it's weird how her
sleeping with someone else

12:25.051 --> 12:26.636
has soured our relationship.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.409
Fine, just asking.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.995
I'm good, really, I'm, I'm fine.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.526
Alright, let's break this guy.

12:35.168 --> 12:36.468
Should I borrow a dress?

12:36.493 --> 12:37.579
We could be twinsies.

12:38.085 --> 12:39.940
Oh, give me five.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.198
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:53.021 --> 12:55.182
Um, should I not be in here?

12:55.759 --> 12:59.259
Oh, no-no-no, it's totally fine,
I was just gonna change.

12:59.284 --> 13:01.339
I'm Sam, Sam Shaw.

13:01.832 --> 13:03.242
Winter Wood.

13:03.801 --> 13:05.268
And I know who you are.

13:05.302 --> 13:07.036
Your picture's in our bedroom.

13:08.482 --> 13:10.834
- What?
- When you were 12.

13:11.062 --> 13:14.531
A newspaper clipping of
you and the boy detective.

13:14.793 --> 13:16.176
Oh.

13:17.011 --> 13:18.075
Um...

13:18.325 --> 13:20.737
Yeah. Harley loves you.

13:22.019 --> 13:23.487
And Dave.

13:24.688 --> 13:28.091
You guys mean the world to him.

13:28.857 --> 13:29.921
Right.

13:33.530 --> 13:38.267
Do you and Harley talk about things?

13:39.868 --> 13:42.301
Like you and Harley things?

13:43.800 --> 13:45.589
He sent me divorce papers.

13:46.377 --> 13:47.406
He did?

13:48.059 --> 13:49.526
Oh, that's something.

13:49.646 --> 13:51.253
At least he's not advertising it.

13:51.353 --> 13:54.844
No, no, no, I mean he hardly
talks about you at all.

13:59.056 --> 14:00.472
That is not what I meant.

14:02.359 --> 14:04.277
But it's true, isn't it?

14:08.365 --> 14:12.279
God, I'm so sorry for just showing up,

14:12.354 --> 14:13.368
I just...

14:13.626 --> 14:15.260
I didn't know what else to do.

14:17.992 --> 14:19.187
Still don't.

14:20.391 --> 14:26.296
Uh... well I have to go
interrogate a suspect.

14:26.376 --> 14:29.375
Yeah, no, of course. You know...

14:29.954 --> 14:31.735
- Go.
- Are you...

14:33.757 --> 14:35.196
Of course you're not okay.

14:41.330 --> 14:42.799
Look out!

14:49.615 --> 14:50.980
What the hell happened?

14:51.575 --> 14:53.183
This guy tried to grab my gun.

14:53.208 --> 14:55.480
He 100% succeeded in grabbing your gun.

14:56.306 --> 14:57.347
What?

14:57.372 --> 15:00.230
Okay, I asked Keller to see
the footage from the wedding.

15:00.285 --> 15:02.819
The next thing I know the
Reverend is yelling "look out,"

15:02.853 --> 15:05.421
and then Keller is
throwing his camera at me,

15:05.455 --> 15:07.736
grabbing Rafalski's
gun, and I guess trying

15:07.761 --> 15:09.979
- to finish the job on Adam...
- Skip to what you did.

15:10.194 --> 15:11.504
I was just about to get there, Dot.

15:11.528 --> 15:13.838
Harley smashes the camera
into Keller's head,

15:13.863 --> 15:15.525
which also smashes the camera.

15:15.743 --> 15:16.976
What happened to the Reverend?

15:17.301 --> 15:18.768
He jumped in, hit his head.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.574
He's just out. His vitals are all good.

15:20.804 --> 15:21.971
So Keller is in on this.

15:22.005 --> 15:25.074
Yeah, it looks that way,
and whatever was on that camera,

15:25.108 --> 15:26.471
he did not want us to see.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.025
Lock him up.

15:35.952 --> 15:37.428
Anybody good with electronics?

15:37.453 --> 15:38.594
I could take a look at it.

15:38.701 --> 15:40.321
You know, inside of a camera,
inside of a body,

15:40.345 --> 15:41.400
how different could it be?

15:41.425 --> 15:43.830
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say completely different.

15:43.980 --> 15:45.180
No, I'm kidding but...

15:45.205 --> 15:47.835
You know, I can take a crack at it,
I'm pretty good with this stuff.

15:47.859 --> 15:49.305
I'm gonna try changing again.

15:49.508 --> 15:51.308
Five minutes,
and then we talk to the shooter.

15:54.484 --> 15:55.684
So scary.

16:05.871 --> 16:07.171
Sam no!

16:14.411 --> 16:16.746
- You okay?
- Don't I look okay?

16:17.558 --> 16:23.201
Well yeah, you look great, but I
thought you uh... might need me.

16:23.715 --> 16:26.313
Well, first thing's first,
this guy smuggled in something

16:26.338 --> 16:28.571
to pick his lock, so we better
make sure our other guest

16:28.596 --> 16:29.899
doesn't also pull a Houdini.

16:35.758 --> 16:36.828
Watch too.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.120
Everything?

16:54.198 --> 16:55.780
Rafalski, full cavity.

16:57.067 --> 16:58.163
That's a little thorough.

16:58.188 --> 16:59.789
Well, fool me once...

17:05.414 --> 17:07.082
Once I get my hand in there...

17:07.107 --> 17:09.200
Finger will suffice,
it's not a puppet show.

17:12.116 --> 17:13.683
We have your partner, Keller.

17:13.708 --> 17:15.708
That's probably not his
real name, but we have him.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.108
You have matching head wounds.

17:18.756 --> 17:21.880
We also have four of your
crew cornered at the hospital.

17:21.905 --> 17:25.194
Whatever you guys were up to,
it's unraveled.

17:25.462 --> 17:28.297
It's time to scrub the
mission and do damage control.

17:32.137 --> 17:35.137
You don't have to say anything,
that's your call. But we have you.

17:35.806 --> 17:38.460
You can talk or not
talk, but you're done.

17:38.776 --> 17:40.398
Attempted murder is a lock.

17:41.156 --> 17:43.279
Assault with a deadly weapon,
concealed firearm...

17:43.313 --> 17:44.866
Assaulting a police officer.

17:45.618 --> 17:46.843
Attempted assault.

17:47.985 --> 17:50.987
My point is, talking can only help you.

17:51.221 --> 17:52.894
You've got nowhere to go but up.

17:53.924 --> 17:55.925
I'm politically naïve,
but I'm pretty sure

17:55.950 --> 17:59.175
the Russian government frowns
upon it's soldiers former

17:59.200 --> 18:02.765
or otherwise shooting up
really pretty parts of Canada.

18:04.919 --> 18:08.291
_

18:12.076 --> 18:13.109
Sam...

18:15.555 --> 18:17.385
This dude's Chechen, not Russian.

18:17.410 --> 18:18.428
Are you sure?

18:18.453 --> 18:20.258
My character went undercover as a member

18:20.283 --> 18:21.750
of the Chechen national rowing team,

18:21.775 --> 18:23.703
and while I had no idea
what I was saying,

18:23.728 --> 18:25.420
I totally remember what it sounded like.

18:25.445 --> 18:27.764
This dude is Chechen, not Russian.

18:29.947 --> 18:31.812
I'm gonna find out if the chief

18:31.837 --> 18:34.241
has gotten that footage
from the hospital yet.

18:34.266 --> 18:37.311
I would love to run those faces
and this guys face against

18:37.336 --> 18:40.444
a database of former members
of the Chechen military.

18:41.460 --> 18:43.853
Harley, why don't you find
out if their intended victim

18:43.878 --> 18:45.345
ever spent any time...

18:45.370 --> 18:46.741
In Chechnya.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.225
It's not like I started
doing this yesterday.

18:49.748 --> 18:53.317
Well, it was the day
before yesterday, so...

19:07.192 --> 19:08.882
So you have no enemies?

19:09.970 --> 19:11.871
Kill me enemies? No way.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.886
What about Doctors Without Borders?

19:14.911 --> 19:17.479
I mean, they go to some gnarly places.

19:17.504 --> 19:19.261
You ever been to Chechnya?

19:20.472 --> 19:21.739
That's a weird question.

19:21.764 --> 19:23.906
- Why's it weird?
- I was born in Chechnya.

19:24.829 --> 19:26.641
Left when I was five, never been back.

19:29.632 --> 19:30.717
Why'd you leave?

19:31.276 --> 19:34.232
Well, the standard jokey answer
is because it's Chechnya,

19:34.257 --> 19:36.300
but it's actually more
complicated than that.

19:36.857 --> 19:38.261
I can handle complicated.

19:39.611 --> 19:42.484
My dad was a kind of freedom
fighter back in the day.

19:43.104 --> 19:45.639
There was a coup,
military took over the country,

19:45.829 --> 19:49.632
they still control the country,
and my dad uh...

19:51.013 --> 19:52.594
My father stood up to them.

19:52.619 --> 19:56.422
He witnessed some atrocities
and he went public.

19:56.993 --> 19:58.193
They killed him.

20:00.260 --> 20:01.677
Like I said, I was five.

20:02.316 --> 20:03.505
I didn't really know him.

20:04.542 --> 20:05.675
Not really.

20:07.357 --> 20:08.798
Just stories.

20:09.393 --> 20:10.560
Yeah, exactly.

20:10.794 --> 20:14.697
Yeah, he was the hero of this
story my mom used to tell.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.303
I never knew my dad.

20:19.903 --> 20:22.982
I got the impression
my mom didn't either.

20:23.240 --> 20:25.020
So if she did have stories about him,

20:25.776 --> 20:27.410
she never told them to me.

20:29.112 --> 20:30.479
Is he still out there?

20:33.383 --> 20:35.384
I always figured if he wanted to...

20:36.720 --> 20:38.421
He knows where to find me.

20:40.090 --> 20:41.791
I think that's our only option.

20:41.825 --> 20:42.959
Say again.

20:42.993 --> 20:45.561
We may need to breach the
room to rescue the hostages.

20:46.513 --> 20:48.197
Well, that's a job for the tactical unit.

20:48.732 --> 20:51.408
No, tactical tried using
McGinley side road

20:51.433 --> 20:52.558
to avoid the flooding in the marsh.

20:52.582 --> 20:54.550
They got stuck,
they're useless at the moment.

20:54.703 --> 20:56.730
And we haven't heard from
the shooters in over an hour.

20:56.754 --> 20:58.167
You know that's not a good sign.

20:58.481 --> 21:00.589
Well, then let me try to get over there.

21:00.614 --> 21:02.528
I'm the only one you've
got with tactical training.

21:02.552 --> 21:05.087
Well, the only one other than me,
you stay put.

21:05.112 --> 21:07.525
Did you get a chance to look
at that footage I sent you?

21:08.567 --> 21:10.485
Well one of them is
definitely the second shooter

21:10.509 --> 21:12.055
from the wedding, they're military,

21:12.080 --> 21:13.359
they were moving echelon right,

21:13.384 --> 21:15.802
and one of them gave the hand
signal for potential threat.

21:16.105 --> 21:17.786
And you think they're from Chechnya.

21:18.354 --> 21:20.855
All the pieces are lining
up that way, yeah.

21:20.880 --> 21:21.903
Okay.

21:22.251 --> 21:24.520
I'll call you after we
rescue these hostages.

21:24.880 --> 21:28.349
If these guys are soldiers and
their mission is to kill Adam,

21:28.438 --> 21:30.239
and Adam is here...

21:30.273 --> 21:32.041
They're not gonna attack
a police station.

21:32.075 --> 21:34.076
They draw the line at
churches and hospitals?

21:37.027 --> 21:38.345
I just jinxed us, didn't I?

21:38.535 --> 21:39.583
Come on.

21:43.631 --> 21:45.819
- Here!
- Hey, Dot made sandwiches.

21:45.844 --> 21:47.553
This is a one-time deal.

21:49.344 --> 21:50.769
Don't get used to it.

21:58.529 --> 21:59.838
Sorry about your honeymoon.

22:00.271 --> 22:03.079
Harley told me to pretend
the rain was Niagara Falls.

22:04.609 --> 22:05.837
He's a nice guy.

22:07.449 --> 22:09.029
- You sound surprised.
- A bit.

22:09.908 --> 22:12.735
You always told me he
was, but I dunno...

22:13.221 --> 22:16.344
money, being famous,
and all that stuff you read...

22:17.334 --> 22:19.193
It's just nice to see you were right.

22:21.421 --> 22:24.153
- Are we gonna be okay?
- Oh, I promise.

22:24.790 --> 22:27.419
And you are gonna have a
great story to tell your kids.

22:28.745 --> 22:29.868
Wanna know a secret?

22:30.130 --> 22:31.173
Always.

22:32.229 --> 22:33.963
One of them's already listening.

22:35.765 --> 22:37.933
- Does...
- Of course he does.

22:37.958 --> 22:40.060
But we haven't told anybody else yet.

22:41.879 --> 22:45.315
Oh my God, congratulations.

22:46.481 --> 22:47.783
Hey, Sam.

22:54.743 --> 22:55.928
Congratulations.

22:57.233 --> 22:58.800
Just... You just gotta hear me out.

23:00.325 --> 23:01.907
I've been thinking about
our Chechen problem

23:01.931 --> 23:04.664
and it made me think of
my favourite TV show.

23:04.922 --> 23:08.157
Uh, not Call Carter,
although it's pretty good.

23:08.528 --> 23:09.531
Jeopardy.

23:09.696 --> 23:10.893
What about Jeopardy?

23:10.984 --> 23:13.652
Who is Abbas Alahmbek?

23:16.341 --> 23:17.893
It was a question on Tuesday's show.

23:17.918 --> 23:20.353
He's the president of Chechnya.
Super bad dude.

23:20.412 --> 23:22.595
It made me think of something Adam said.

23:22.620 --> 23:24.660
I wanna run Alahmbek's
name past our cameraman,

23:24.685 --> 23:26.325
- see if he flinches.
- Okay.

23:32.672 --> 23:35.113
I'm gonna check on Adam and the camera.

23:41.931 --> 23:43.198
Hey.

23:43.924 --> 23:44.924
Hey.

23:49.140 --> 23:50.207
Um...

23:51.152 --> 23:52.552
I feel like I should say something.

23:53.271 --> 23:54.939
Or maybe you should say something.

23:55.083 --> 23:56.656
I feel like something should be said.

23:58.695 --> 24:00.015
Do you still love me?

24:01.083 --> 24:02.150
At all?

24:05.399 --> 24:08.468
You just caught me off guard
showing up out of the blue.

24:08.549 --> 24:12.652
My plan was not to ambush you.

24:12.694 --> 24:17.765
I mean, you know me,
I got the papers and I just... went.

24:18.797 --> 24:20.264
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

24:20.377 --> 24:21.847
No, I'm sorry.

24:23.804 --> 24:25.319
These last few months...

24:26.868 --> 24:28.647
What was going on between us, that...

24:29.903 --> 24:31.437
That's not all on you.

24:31.673 --> 24:34.007
I made that choice.

24:34.032 --> 24:36.739
I know, but before that.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.231
I haven't been happy.

24:42.349 --> 24:43.414
And that's not your fault,

24:43.439 --> 24:46.454
I feel like I threw some
of that sadness at you.

24:48.125 --> 24:49.329
You're better here.

24:50.763 --> 24:51.837
Your home.

24:53.118 --> 24:54.644
LA was never your home.

24:55.838 --> 24:56.917
We had a home.

24:58.417 --> 24:59.488
We had a house.

25:00.215 --> 25:01.782
I mean a really, really nice house.

25:01.832 --> 25:02.965
So nice.

25:03.957 --> 25:05.791
I see the way you are here.

25:06.415 --> 25:09.317
You're lighter.

25:14.437 --> 25:20.843
A tiny weird wise woman once
told me it takes two to tango,

25:20.940 --> 25:23.237
but three to have an affair.

25:26.417 --> 25:30.420
You know on our wedding day
Dot told me not to marry you.

25:32.194 --> 25:33.820
That is so unlike her.

25:35.356 --> 25:36.823
Hey guys, sorry to interrupt.

25:37.248 --> 25:38.625
Sam wanted me to find you.

25:38.650 --> 25:40.539
Adam got the camera up and running.

25:41.012 --> 25:42.846
Yeah, I'll... I'll be right in.

25:47.450 --> 25:48.469
Go.

25:57.635 --> 25:59.545
Okay, I don't have a ton of juice left,

25:59.570 --> 26:03.175
but take a look at that.

26:05.375 --> 26:08.277
Okay, okay, okay.

26:09.003 --> 26:11.491
Right there, literally
right in front of me.

26:11.516 --> 26:12.736
Does he always think out loud?

26:12.761 --> 26:14.586
Not always, but also not never.

26:14.611 --> 26:15.711
Harley, share.

26:16.820 --> 26:18.070
It's the procession.

26:18.095 --> 26:19.828
Why is he filming the priest?

26:20.510 --> 26:25.114
This is not a wedding video,
it's an assassination video.

26:26.079 --> 26:29.148
If I may go all Harley
Carter for a moment...

26:29.260 --> 26:31.640
Now we know who the
star of this movie is.

26:34.626 --> 26:35.937
I am.

26:38.976 --> 26:40.810
I have a confession to make.

26:45.177 --> 26:46.391
Hello son.

26:56.208 --> 26:58.386
"Luke; I am your father."

27:02.164 --> 27:04.685
Abbas Alahmbek: President to Chechnya,

27:04.710 --> 27:07.557
super bad dude,
about to go on trial for war crimes.

27:07.596 --> 27:09.541
War crimes committed a few years ago.

27:10.221 --> 27:11.588
War crimes you witnessed.

27:12.283 --> 27:14.979
I'm supposed to testify
at the Hague next month.

27:15.398 --> 27:17.780
Only the lead prosecutor
knows I've been living

27:17.805 --> 27:18.992
in Canada all this time.

27:19.288 --> 27:20.421
To watch over your son.

27:20.822 --> 27:26.118
No, no, I had to stay away.

27:26.798 --> 27:28.265
But um...

27:29.221 --> 27:31.815
I knew that there was a
fair chance that his mother

27:31.840 --> 27:34.116
would bring him to this country.

27:34.141 --> 27:37.001
She had family in Quebec.

27:39.210 --> 27:40.310
What is happening?

27:41.497 --> 27:43.007
He didn't wanna miss your wedding.

27:43.293 --> 27:45.649
And this Alahmbek clearly suspects

27:45.674 --> 27:47.930
that you might be alive,
because he sent a kill team

27:47.955 --> 27:49.517
on the off chance that you would be there.

27:49.994 --> 27:52.098
For many years he did think I was dead.

27:52.887 --> 27:55.171
And for all intents and purposes, I was.

27:55.699 --> 27:57.302
But as we got close to trial,

27:57.327 --> 27:59.138
he started to put the pieces together.

27:59.163 --> 28:02.211
Realized that the prosecution's
top secret witness

28:02.236 --> 28:03.296
could only be me.

28:03.991 --> 28:05.995
Did you kill the real priest?

28:06.268 --> 28:07.640
Dot, of course he didn't.

28:07.665 --> 28:09.855
Your first instinct is always to trust.

28:10.245 --> 28:11.766
It's like you think it's a good thing.

28:11.799 --> 28:14.279
You know what, Dot? We'll deal
with your crazy childhood later.

28:14.516 --> 28:15.816
I'm a real priest.

28:15.936 --> 28:17.884
Have been for almost 20 years.

28:19.838 --> 28:23.138
When I heard about the wedding,
it only cost me one phone call

28:23.163 --> 28:26.219
and a fairly expensive bottle
of wine to get this job.

28:26.244 --> 28:27.251
Okay, wait.

28:29.952 --> 28:31.064
You're my dad?

28:36.228 --> 28:39.531
When you were little, I had to die.

28:41.158 --> 28:43.643
Alahmbek would have killed
you and your mother both

28:43.668 --> 28:45.258
if he thought I could be hurt by it.

28:45.283 --> 28:46.976
Dying was the only way.

28:49.465 --> 28:51.857
And then I heard you
were getting married.

28:53.306 --> 28:57.258
I wasn't sure if I'd have
another chance to see you,

28:59.040 --> 29:00.196
to meet you.

29:02.176 --> 29:03.407
What do you mean?

29:04.401 --> 29:05.937
Why didn't you say something?

29:07.023 --> 29:09.144
He's going to testify.

29:10.521 --> 29:11.621
He's going public.

29:11.929 --> 29:14.964
President Alahmbek is a
vengeful man with many friends.

29:15.893 --> 29:19.448
I was desperately trying to
think of a way out of this

29:19.473 --> 29:22.338
that wouldn't also destroy your life.

29:23.106 --> 29:24.745
It was foolish of me.

29:27.375 --> 29:30.555
This is so strange, I mean
I hear you but I don't...

29:31.537 --> 29:32.711
I don't know you.

29:33.832 --> 29:37.232
I will show you who your father is.

29:38.187 --> 29:41.107
This is your father.

29:47.180 --> 29:49.273
Now the battery dies on me? Really?

29:49.910 --> 29:51.042
All right, you know what?

29:51.996 --> 29:54.071
What I was gonna show you on the video

29:54.105 --> 29:56.892
is that when those guys got up,
it was the Reverend,

29:56.917 --> 29:59.509
it was your father who pulled you down

30:00.234 --> 30:02.301
and laid his body on top of yours.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.111
A little late.

30:04.553 --> 30:05.560
Dot.

30:05.814 --> 30:08.338
Why don't we give these
guys a little space?

30:13.191 --> 30:15.025
I wanna put the cameraman
in the box next.

30:15.059 --> 30:17.889
Sam, listen, I know how
much you love adventures,

30:17.914 --> 30:20.572
but we're talking international
war crimes here, okay?

30:20.597 --> 30:22.780
Isn't that a little above our-paygradey?

30:22.805 --> 30:24.750
The RCMP agree,
they don't want us to do anything

30:24.775 --> 30:26.243
- until they get here.
- Well, what's their ETA?

30:26.267 --> 30:27.532
Well, they're looking at their options,

30:27.556 --> 30:29.631
but with the flooding,
Bishop is effectively cut off

30:29.656 --> 30:31.135
from anything but a chopper,
and a chopper can't fly

30:31.159 --> 30:32.858
in this weather, so we are on our own.

30:33.541 --> 30:35.693
You and Leona put Keller
in the interview room.

30:35.795 --> 30:36.802
Yeah.

30:39.459 --> 30:40.493
What?

30:41.347 --> 30:42.428
My keys...

30:44.489 --> 30:45.517
What's going on?

30:45.542 --> 30:47.702
Stay in the bullpen with the Reverend,
he's our target.

30:56.565 --> 30:58.033
How did he get past Leona?

30:58.067 --> 31:00.019
I asked her to watch all of the doors

31:00.044 --> 31:01.371
so he coulda slipped past her then.

31:01.395 --> 31:02.871
In the meantime,
you're supposed to check him

31:02.895 --> 31:04.306
for anything he can use
to get out of his cell.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.358
- You let him steal your keys?
- He's one of them.

31:06.412 --> 31:07.417
Sadly, he's not.

31:07.442 --> 31:10.442
We will have words later,
for the moment nobody goes anywhere

31:10.467 --> 31:11.789
by themselves, got it?

31:12.242 --> 31:13.627
Also, did you see this?

31:14.468 --> 31:15.535
He smashed the radio.

31:16.066 --> 31:19.035
Check your phone. We lost
service 20 minutes ago.

31:19.060 --> 31:20.753
One of the towers must
be out of commission.

31:20.777 --> 31:22.775
So now we have no way
to contact anybody?

31:22.800 --> 31:24.267
Can't blame you for that Rafalski.

31:24.641 --> 31:26.108
We need to find this guy.

31:26.133 --> 31:27.907
Are you suggesting that
we search every nook

31:27.936 --> 31:29.471
and cranny of this very large building?

31:29.495 --> 31:31.168
Are you suggesting that
we just let him go?

31:31.192 --> 31:33.417
Well, if we didn't have a bullpen
full of wedding party

31:33.442 --> 31:34.988
I would say yeah, let's track him down,

31:35.007 --> 31:37.769
but our primary responsibility
is to make sure the Reverend

31:37.794 --> 31:39.351
and others are safe 'til help gets here.

31:39.375 --> 31:42.014
Rafalski, you can see all
approach to the bullpen

31:42.039 --> 31:43.504
from here, but I need you frosty,

31:43.529 --> 31:44.859
- can you dial it in?
- Yeah.

31:44.884 --> 31:46.368
You think this guy's
still in the building?

31:46.392 --> 31:47.890
For now, we have to assume yes.

31:47.915 --> 31:49.320
A moment?

32:08.248 --> 32:09.263
Clear.

32:13.393 --> 32:14.459
Where'd they go?

32:19.050 --> 32:20.872
- Where does this go?
- I dunno.

32:21.152 --> 32:24.215
Well, if we're lucky it runs into
the sewers and they'll drown.

32:24.879 --> 32:26.770
Take two officers and
see where it leads.

32:27.725 --> 32:30.353
I'm getting back to the station
if I have to walk there.

32:31.021 --> 32:32.143
Got it, Chief.

32:34.361 --> 32:36.355
Alright, Keller knows how
few of us there are,

32:36.388 --> 32:38.090
and he thinks that we
can't call for help.

32:38.299 --> 32:39.441
But he's wrong.

32:40.104 --> 32:41.644
The radios in the cruisers.

32:42.621 --> 32:44.878
One of us has to go out there,
call the chief,

32:44.903 --> 32:46.879
but we don't know where
Keller and the others are.

32:47.507 --> 32:48.747
Alright, well it's gotta be me.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.815
Leona stays with the Reverend,
you are the best shot we have.

32:51.849 --> 32:54.221
You cover me, I make it to the
cruisers and radio the chief,

32:54.413 --> 32:56.830
we lock the doors in here and
wait for the cavalry to arrive.

32:56.910 --> 32:58.635
No, what about Rafalski?

32:58.788 --> 33:00.290
Have you ever seen Rafalski run?

33:01.697 --> 33:02.898
Me neither, but come on,

33:03.127 --> 33:05.447
are you really up for a plan
that revolves around that guy?

33:06.381 --> 33:07.557
It's me, Sam.

33:10.491 --> 33:11.506
Okay.

33:12.503 --> 33:14.738
I got the keys, the
cruiser's 50 feet away,

33:14.782 --> 33:16.656
I shoot the breeze with
the chief on the radio,

33:16.681 --> 33:17.851
I'm back in two minutes.

33:17.876 --> 33:19.510
What will take two minutes?

33:20.544 --> 33:23.013
Jesus, what do these people
not understand about lockdown?

33:23.285 --> 33:25.472
Harley just has to check something.

33:27.107 --> 33:28.181
Be careful.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.251
Be fast.

33:30.572 --> 33:32.604
Fast and careful is my middle name.

33:36.353 --> 33:37.786
Three... two...

33:37.891 --> 33:38.969
One.

33:48.820 --> 33:49.873
Great.

33:59.886 --> 34:01.695
At least we know where
the other shooters are.

34:12.556 --> 34:14.478
I want the civilians to have vests too.

34:14.504 --> 34:17.734
The cupboards are bare,
every cop in the city including

34:17.759 --> 34:20.335
a couple retirees are all
pulling duty right now.

34:23.333 --> 34:24.635
To serve and protect.

34:30.882 --> 34:32.069
You should have it.

34:32.094 --> 34:34.205
Can we please not fight
about this one thing?

34:40.822 --> 34:41.864
How do I look?

34:42.118 --> 34:43.150
You pull it off.

34:44.828 --> 34:48.597
Okay, if any of us say hit
the floor you hit the floor

34:48.630 --> 34:51.315
and stay down until you get
the all clear, got it?

34:51.922 --> 34:53.984
Alright, I won't waste time saying

34:54.009 --> 34:56.360
that we're gonna get through this,
because that is a given.

34:56.786 --> 35:00.565
Leona, you go back out to the hall.

35:00.905 --> 35:04.541
Rafalski, you and Harley stay in
here and protect the civilians.

35:07.745 --> 35:10.188
Dot, you back up Leona.

35:10.213 --> 35:11.679
One of you has eyes on the front door,

35:11.703 --> 35:12.984
the other watches the main hallway.

35:13.008 --> 35:14.342
Obviously.

35:15.263 --> 35:17.342
- Well, where are you going?
- I'm gonna check the service door,

35:17.366 --> 35:19.631
it's our weak spot. If they're
coming in it's the obvious choice.

35:19.655 --> 35:21.730
- And you want me to just stay here?
- Yep, I'll be right back.

35:21.754 --> 35:23.916
Do not take your eyes off
the Reverend or anyone else.

35:26.159 --> 35:27.506
I've got a bad feeling about this.

35:27.530 --> 35:29.498
Letting the bad guys
make the first move.

35:29.995 --> 35:32.144
Your partner's smart, you stay put,

35:32.169 --> 35:33.964
let the enemy make the first mistake.

36:47.927 --> 36:48.960
Why are you smiling?

36:48.985 --> 36:50.886
Cause I've been stalling.

37:29.253 --> 37:30.667
Everyone stay down!

37:30.955 --> 37:32.074
Flashbang!

37:39.887 --> 37:41.087
Don't move!

37:48.306 --> 37:50.907
- Oh my God.
- She had a flashbang?

37:51.168 --> 37:52.332
This surprises you?

38:05.189 --> 38:07.854
I don't know how to thank you.

38:08.463 --> 38:10.096
Stay alive, try that.

38:10.328 --> 38:13.766
Strangely, and perhaps it's
just that the rain has stopped

38:13.791 --> 38:16.065
I'm feeling more
optimistic about things.

38:16.279 --> 38:17.761
Well, if there's
anything else we can do,

38:17.785 --> 38:20.153
just ask, it's a great
thing that you're doing.

38:20.178 --> 38:23.242
What you're doing here,
not so small a thing either.

38:23.699 --> 38:24.734
God bless you.

38:24.966 --> 38:26.734
Thank you, you as well. Good luck.

38:27.629 --> 38:28.709
Hey.

38:29.934 --> 38:31.545
So according to these
guys, our honeymoon

38:31.570 --> 38:33.453
will be some place called
protective custody.

38:33.564 --> 38:34.998
Yeah, send a postcard.

38:35.886 --> 38:37.118
Would it be weird if we kept in touch?

38:37.142 --> 38:38.415
Weird if we didn't.

38:39.399 --> 38:40.979
- Thanks.
- Bye guys.

38:43.533 --> 38:44.916
- Sam?
- Hey.

38:44.941 --> 38:46.941
- I just heard, are you okay?
- I'm okay. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.

38:51.130 --> 38:52.195
Come on.

39:06.363 --> 39:07.435
My cab is here.

39:08.835 --> 39:09.880
Right.

39:25.242 --> 39:26.498
You be the hero, Harley.

40:07.604 --> 40:08.604
Idiot.
