A NETFLIX SERIES

00:08.000 --> 00:09.208
ONLY COOL PEOPLE

00:16.458 --> 00:17.458
IT'S BALL NIGHT!

00:17.541 --> 00:19.125
GET YOUR DRINK, FUCKER!

00:20.333 --> 00:21.375
WE'RE ROLLING!

00:36.125 --> 00:37.000
Hey.

00:37.500 --> 00:38.791
-Hey!
-Just got here?

00:38.875 --> 00:41.208
I was working with my mom at the ball.

00:41.291 --> 00:45.333
It was great.
I have to study all day tomorrow.

00:45.416 --> 00:47.666
Check it out. It's insane.

00:49.416 --> 00:50.250
Wow!

00:51.833 --> 00:54.000
I'm exhausted from work.

00:54.083 --> 00:57.416
The mall is hard work.
I can't smile anymore.

00:58.166 --> 01:01.791
I'll wake up early tomorrow
to help the youth group at church.

01:01.875 --> 01:04.333
Where do you find the time?

01:04.416 --> 01:05.708
I don't, girl.

01:05.791 --> 01:08.625
I think I'm going back in.
What do you think?

01:09.208 --> 01:12.958
I don't know. It's kinda late.
Don't you have to study tomorrow?

01:13.458 --> 01:16.541
Think about it. They're there every day.

01:16.625 --> 01:18.416
Rita, you could come too.

01:18.500 --> 01:19.875
-No…
-It'd be great.

01:19.958 --> 01:22.416
You were always dancing with the boys,

01:22.500 --> 01:23.833
busting your moves.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.583
-My classic move.
-It was awesome!

01:26.666 --> 01:28.000
It'll be great, come.

01:28.083 --> 01:30.000
No, friend. I can't.

01:30.625 --> 01:31.500
It's life.

01:32.125 --> 01:35.041
My choices.
I have a different mindset now.

01:36.083 --> 01:39.250
I think they should even stop the balls.

01:39.916 --> 01:43.083
It's very loud. It bothers many people.

01:43.666 --> 01:45.416
Did you really say that?

01:47.041 --> 01:49.333
The ball pays our bills.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.166
Ever thought about that?

01:59.333 --> 02:01.333
BASED ON THE ORIGINAL IDEA

DAILY READING

02:36.000 --> 02:37.166
Lord have mercy!

02:41.500 --> 02:42.750
-Morning.
-Morning.

02:42.833 --> 02:44.375
Where's the group meeting?

02:44.458 --> 02:46.250
Over there, but it's started.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.833
I'm so late.

02:47.916 --> 02:50.166
Tell me about it. I didn't sleep well.

02:50.250 --> 02:52.416
Me too. Major funk ball near me.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.250
I'm still on Canada time.

02:56.291 --> 02:58.625
-Hi, I'm Levi.
-I'm Rita.

02:58.708 --> 03:00.250
You're the pastor's son, right?

03:13.750 --> 03:17.375
Even if I have to go to hell,
we'll find out who it was.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.083
-He will pay.
-Nando!

03:19.166 --> 03:20.666
You gotta stop the balls.

03:20.750 --> 03:22.625
It's just trouble and noise.

03:22.708 --> 03:24.541
Okay, we'll figure it out.

03:24.625 --> 03:25.875
-It's bad, man.
-Okay.

03:29.333 --> 03:30.416
Nando.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.541
It reeks of urine!

03:32.625 --> 03:34.750
I can't open the joint like this, man.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.333
First, good morning, Mr. Manoel.

03:37.875 --> 03:40.708
Don't worry. We'll see
what's best for everyone.

03:40.791 --> 03:42.541
-God be with you.
-Amen.

03:50.958 --> 03:52.875
STAFF

03:55.375 --> 03:56.875
Fuck, man.

03:56.958 --> 03:59.208
Man, this is one hell of a ride.

03:59.291 --> 04:00.958
Man, you don't get it.

04:01.041 --> 04:04.083
This is the mother ship. Wanna know why?

04:04.166 --> 04:07.916
After the ball, all the chicks
are gonna want to get in.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.791
Cruising on the mother ship

04:11.708 --> 04:12.791
It's Doni's

04:13.375 --> 04:15.541
You're nuts, but the girls will dig it.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.333
Let's check it out.

04:18.333 --> 04:19.958
I hope you like it, Doni.

04:20.041 --> 04:22.625
You'll be in here longer
than in your new home.

04:28.708 --> 04:30.041
Man!

04:30.125 --> 04:32.458
I don't know about you,

04:32.541 --> 04:34.041
but I'll live here.

04:34.125 --> 04:35.458
Goddamn!

04:35.958 --> 04:38.416
Charity is the mission of the church.

04:38.500 --> 04:41.291
-So it's my mission and yours…
-It's ours.

04:41.375 --> 04:43.000
-It's ours.
-Our mission.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.041
So cool.

04:44.583 --> 04:46.416
Three hundred bags to donate.

04:47.291 --> 04:48.125
What?

04:48.708 --> 04:51.291
We managed to get a lot of donations.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.916
-Think so?
-You disagree?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.375
With the nine grand they got,

04:56.458 --> 04:58.708
we can double the toiletries.

04:59.291 --> 05:00.500
I worked with it.

05:01.166 --> 05:03.958
It's not the best product,
but it is something.

05:04.041 --> 05:05.541
Bye, Samara.

05:07.125 --> 05:09.166
-Eliseu, Raquel.
-Hey, Levi.

05:09.250 --> 05:12.500
Can I still help with tomorrow's campaign?

05:12.583 --> 05:13.750
-Sure.
-Yeah.

05:13.833 --> 05:17.541
Because Rita had a great idea.

05:19.333 --> 05:20.625
Get some rest.

05:20.708 --> 05:23.083
We've got five performances tomorrow.

05:23.166 --> 05:26.916
Jundiaí, Itu, Jaguariúna,
Piracicaba, and Campinas.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.208
-Know these places?
-I heard about a few.

05:29.291 --> 05:32.458
Let's go. By the end of the year,
you'll know the entire country.

05:32.541 --> 05:33.875
In your face!

05:33.958 --> 05:35.916
Don't scream, idiot!

05:36.000 --> 05:38.333
-Are you gonna cry?
-In your face!

05:38.916 --> 05:40.208
Hey, family!

05:40.291 --> 05:43.458
Check out Daddy's ride!

05:43.541 --> 05:45.333
Look who's here. Say hello.

05:45.416 --> 05:47.833
-Hello!
-Fucking video game.

05:47.916 --> 05:48.875
Awesome.

05:48.958 --> 05:52.416
Alright, family. I'm traveling upstate.
We're on our way.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.333
Let's roll.

05:54.541 --> 05:56.583
ON THE ROAD!
CHECK OUT THE GIGS

05:57.708 --> 05:59.458
TALLY IS FOLLOWING YOU

06:10.625 --> 06:11.958
Is that right, Nando?

06:12.041 --> 06:15.125
Beiço's boys were arrested the same way?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.708
It seems that's happening all the time.

06:17.791 --> 06:19.500
With the same people.

06:19.583 --> 06:22.375
Don't worry.
When I find the rat, he's dead.

06:22.458 --> 06:24.250
Alright, man. Word.

06:24.333 --> 06:25.875
Find out who the pigs are.

06:27.916 --> 06:31.125
Badá, I wanted to talk to you
about something else.

06:31.208 --> 06:34.833
The ball is important,
but there have been complaints.

06:34.916 --> 06:37.041
It's not making us money.

06:37.125 --> 06:40.208
I know, but the ball
generates good income.

06:40.291 --> 06:43.208
We can't risk losing one cent, man.

06:43.291 --> 06:46.625
Before we regain our losses
and find out who the rat is,

06:46.708 --> 06:48.625
the ball remains a risk.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.041
Every ball causes me trouble.

06:51.125 --> 06:53.541
The cops always come. It's fucking risky.

06:53.625 --> 06:56.125
You're right, homie. It's your call.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.583
God be with you. Later.

06:57.666 --> 06:59.750
Alright, man. You got it.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.208
You're in charge of the ball now.

07:04.916 --> 07:07.791
What? You're the owner.
Won't you be in charge?

07:07.875 --> 07:09.541
You're the manager now, bro.

07:09.625 --> 07:12.875
Let them know the ball
has been canceled indefinitely.

07:12.958 --> 07:15.125
People can dance at home.

07:19.833 --> 07:20.916
Alright, bro.

07:23.625 --> 07:26.708
Yo, I've got a message for you.

07:26.791 --> 07:28.791
Important message for Vila Áurea.

07:28.875 --> 07:30.916
From now on, the ball is canceled.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.041
I repeat, no more balls.

07:33.125 --> 07:36.708
They're slowing the shop down,
and that's not cool.

07:36.791 --> 07:38.833
Violators will hear from us.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.625
That's all for now. Good luck.

07:42.791 --> 07:44.791
"Violators will hear from us."

07:44.875 --> 07:47.250
Fuck, man. Sounded like Badá.

07:49.375 --> 07:50.583
We gangsta, man.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.041
Yeah, that's how we roll.

08:13.583 --> 08:15.583
-Sup, brothers?
-Hey, man.

08:15.666 --> 08:17.208
-Good to see you.
-Cool.

08:17.291 --> 08:18.791
-Hey, Nando.
-All good?

08:18.875 --> 08:19.833
Sup, man?

08:19.916 --> 08:21.500
Bro, what's going on

08:21.583 --> 08:23.916
with the pigs rolling the hood?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.708
We think someone
ratted us out to the cops.

08:26.791 --> 08:28.416
They jumped us, man.

08:28.500 --> 08:31.041
-It's happening often.
-I know.

08:31.125 --> 08:33.416
We'll have a talk with two of our hoppers.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.083
Try to find out who the fuckers are.

08:36.166 --> 08:38.250
That's right, brother. No slack.

08:38.333 --> 08:40.791
Get everyone on this.

08:40.875 --> 08:41.958
Eyes open.

08:42.041 --> 08:44.375
We've got to figure out these raids.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.458
Deal.

08:45.541 --> 08:47.416
When we find out, checkmate.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.500
I'll crush the motherfuckers.

08:49.583 --> 08:52.000
-Alright, brother.
-Let me know.

08:52.083 --> 08:54.041
-Alright, brother.
-Cool, brother.

09:06.083 --> 09:08.250
Jaspion, hear me out.

09:08.750 --> 09:11.958
We'll make money with these shirts.

09:12.041 --> 09:13.541
Check it out.

09:14.125 --> 09:15.708
This one is rad.

09:16.791 --> 09:19.833
Doni, you could take some pics

09:19.916 --> 09:22.041
to post on the shop's IG.

09:23.250 --> 09:25.833
-I'm talking to you, man.
-Hey, partner?

09:25.916 --> 09:27.416
Pay attention, man.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.750
All day simpin' on that chick.

09:29.833 --> 09:31.875
Man, Tally is super hot.

09:31.958 --> 09:33.500
The girl's got clout.

09:33.583 --> 09:36.125
She's got more followers than you.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.958
She only goes out with ballers.

09:39.041 --> 09:40.041
Loaded guys.

09:40.125 --> 09:43.166
Why don't you text her?

09:43.250 --> 09:46.125
-Send a DM.
-Check this out.

09:46.208 --> 09:49.000
TALLY LIKED YOUR PICTURE

09:49.083 --> 09:50.666
She's checking my pics!

09:56.750 --> 09:58.166
Send her a DM.

09:58.708 --> 10:01.916
HEY, TALLY. WHAT'S GOOD?
MC DONI HERE

10:02.000 --> 10:03.625
Should I send it?

10:04.125 --> 10:05.583
Are you insane, fucker?

10:05.666 --> 10:07.416
-What did you do?
-It worked.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.125
She's typing.

10:09.208 --> 10:10.166
I KNOW IT'S YOU!

10:10.250 --> 10:12.541
-She replied. It's working.
-Look.

10:12.625 --> 10:16.291
PARTY TOMORROW NIGHT?

10:16.375 --> 10:18.416
SURE, GLADLY

10:18.500 --> 10:22.000
You're making plans,
but we're in Campinas tomorrow.

10:23.083 --> 10:24.583
We can make it.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.208
We can make it. It's cool.

10:31.041 --> 10:32.041
Door!

10:35.333 --> 10:36.458
Hey!

10:38.250 --> 10:39.791
Hello, brother.

10:40.458 --> 10:42.125
-How are you?
-Good. You?

10:42.208 --> 10:44.416
I'm great. Three gates to get here.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.375
Really? Did you like it?

10:46.458 --> 10:48.041
Loved it! It's a blessing.

10:49.458 --> 10:50.458
Brother…

10:51.500 --> 10:53.000
It's beautiful!

10:54.125 --> 10:56.375
Auntie, the lasagna smells great!

10:56.458 --> 10:57.791
It's almost ready.

10:58.375 --> 10:59.666
Door, Doni.

10:59.750 --> 11:00.750
Hey!

11:00.833 --> 11:02.416
-Hey, brother!
-Sup?

11:02.500 --> 11:04.041
-Good, you?
-Great.

11:04.625 --> 11:07.083
-Hey, sister-in-law!
-Check this out!

11:07.166 --> 11:08.333
It's awesome, man.

11:08.416 --> 11:10.500
You're flying, Doni boy.

11:10.583 --> 11:12.125
That will be a studio.

11:12.208 --> 11:13.625
-That's cool.
-No way!

11:13.708 --> 11:15.958
-Your blessing, Auntie.
-God bless you.

11:16.041 --> 11:17.791
Wow, it's huge.

11:17.875 --> 11:19.666
You haven't seen my room yet.

11:19.750 --> 11:21.583
-No way.
-I have a Jacuzzi.

11:21.666 --> 11:23.458
-Show me.
-For real.

11:23.541 --> 11:26.583
-It's huge, man.
-Smells like a new home!

11:26.666 --> 11:27.500
Hey.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.250
You disappeared from the group.

11:30.333 --> 11:33.625
That number is gone.
I'll text you from the new one.

11:34.208 --> 11:36.000
-I'll be waiting.
-I mean it.

11:37.416 --> 11:40.208
Kids, lunch is served.

11:40.291 --> 11:43.250
She's terrible, Auntie.
Cheekier by the day.

11:43.333 --> 11:44.250
Like her dad.

11:44.833 --> 11:47.666
My God! I miss little Bruna.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.041
She misses you.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.125
You could bring her sometime.

11:51.208 --> 11:53.875
I will, if you all watch her.

11:54.458 --> 11:55.666
Guys, I gotta go.

11:55.750 --> 11:58.500
I need to get my outfit
before the performance.

11:58.583 --> 12:00.625
Daddy needs a new look.

12:01.583 --> 12:04.291
Make yourselves at home.
I'm happy to have you.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.541
You're doing amazing.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.250
-Congratulations.
-Cool.

12:08.333 --> 12:09.166
I mean it.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.833
Don't get jealous.

12:10.916 --> 12:12.083
Look who's talking.

12:12.166 --> 12:15.541
I'm really happy to see
everyone together again.

12:15.625 --> 12:17.458
-Stop it, Mom.
-Auntie!

12:17.541 --> 12:20.000
Bye, guys. I really have to go.

12:20.083 --> 12:20.916
Bye, Mom.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.041
Take care, Son.

12:22.125 --> 12:23.958
Alright. Don't be late, guys.

12:24.041 --> 12:26.000
-Later!
-God be with you.

12:26.083 --> 12:28.375
-Who'll help me?
-I got the dishes.

12:28.458 --> 12:30.166
-Me too.
-Let's go, then.

12:31.208 --> 12:34.958
-Auntie, where do these dishes go?
-In the top cupboard.

12:35.041 --> 12:36.583
Awesome view.

12:38.916 --> 12:40.333
It is beautiful.

12:42.041 --> 12:43.125
Nando, tell me.

12:43.208 --> 12:45.541
Will Aunt Lu keep doing this?

12:45.625 --> 12:47.958
I stopped by the market the other day.

12:48.833 --> 12:50.458
She was out of many things.

12:50.958 --> 12:52.625
It was all empty.

12:52.708 --> 12:54.333
It hurt me to see it.

12:56.041 --> 12:57.250
It's normal, Scheyla.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.666
-Uncle Chico managed it.
-Yeah.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.666
Doni's busy. Who would help her?

13:01.750 --> 13:03.791
Doesn't she seem kinda off?

13:06.458 --> 13:08.625
I think retail is not for her.

13:09.125 --> 13:10.458
It's not easy.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.500
I told Doni to sell it
and bring his mother here.

13:14.583 --> 13:15.583
It'd be good.

13:16.791 --> 13:19.208
Auntie Lu is like a mother to me.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.916
I won't let anything happen to her.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.083
Is it here?

13:39.041 --> 13:42.833
Yes. Of all the places I saw,
this one was the best.

13:42.916 --> 13:44.750
I want to hear your opinion.

13:44.833 --> 13:46.750
I'm curious. Let's get inside.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.125
Dear Lord.

13:50.625 --> 13:53.958
I can't wait to see
our future church here.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.041
Do you regret your offer to help, Rita?

13:57.125 --> 13:58.708
Never, Pastor.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.916
Thanks for everything.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.458
Thank you.

14:02.541 --> 14:04.208
You're always by my side.

14:04.708 --> 14:09.166
-Even when I'm stubborn and can't see…
-That's in the past.

14:13.458 --> 14:16.125
You were concerned
about me meeting my father.

14:17.833 --> 14:20.041
You were trying to protect me, right?

14:20.583 --> 14:21.583
Always.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.416
When I was a child,

14:27.500 --> 14:30.041
I thought my dad
was the bravest man in the world.

14:31.458 --> 14:33.541
Today, I see he's afraid.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.208
I was never afraid.

14:38.458 --> 14:39.833
You're strong, Rita.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.833
You'll take care of our books.

14:46.916 --> 14:48.000
Pastor?

14:48.083 --> 14:50.000
No one's better at it.

14:57.208 --> 14:58.333
Pastor,

14:58.875 --> 15:01.833
this will be the nicest church
in the neighborhood.

15:02.541 --> 15:04.583
-Amen.
-Amen.

15:17.541 --> 15:19.750
You're an angel, Auntie. Thank you.

15:19.833 --> 15:21.000
Don't worry.

15:21.708 --> 15:24.666
-I knew I could count on you.
-Always.

15:24.750 --> 15:28.500
Now that we've received
this huge donation, better get sharing.

15:28.583 --> 15:29.416
Yay!

15:29.500 --> 15:31.708
Mom, we said we'd take the boxes.

15:31.791 --> 15:34.583
-Mrs. Rose is always so impatient.
-What can I do?

15:34.666 --> 15:35.833
-Hi, Rita.
-Hey.

15:35.916 --> 15:36.791
How goes it?

15:36.875 --> 15:38.791
Your mother is strong.

15:38.875 --> 15:41.750
I carried you both, one on each arm.

15:41.833 --> 15:44.083
This is Levi. He's helping me.

15:44.166 --> 15:45.458
Hi, how are you?

15:45.541 --> 15:48.458
Speaking of which,
I need to double the donations

15:48.541 --> 15:50.125
and give this all away.

15:50.208 --> 15:52.125
-It'll work out.
-Thanks, Auntie.

15:52.208 --> 15:53.750
Good job, boys.

15:54.250 --> 15:57.625
Mrs. Rose, now that we are done,

15:57.708 --> 16:01.916
we could go home, get some rest,
find something to eat…

16:02.000 --> 16:04.708
No, I'm off to the community center.

16:04.791 --> 16:07.250
And there's the ball thing to figure out.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.166
-Yikes.
-It's true.

16:09.250 --> 16:13.000
We can take you there,
then we'll go to Doni's.

16:13.083 --> 16:14.166
Okay, let's go.

16:14.250 --> 16:17.083
Are you insane? You're gonna drop me!

16:17.166 --> 16:18.333
You're nuts!

16:20.083 --> 16:21.583
Hey, brother. All good?

16:21.666 --> 16:23.000
Nice to meet you.

16:25.583 --> 16:26.708
-Hey, family.
-Hey.

16:26.791 --> 16:29.000
First of all, a warm welcome to you.

16:29.083 --> 16:31.166
Thanks for coming.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.541
So, brother?

16:32.625 --> 16:35.083
What happened? Tell us what went down.

16:35.666 --> 16:37.000
I don't know, man.

16:37.625 --> 16:39.416
I only transported it.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.416
Partner, open up.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.166
You didn't check if you were being tailed.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.208
I didn't see anyone.

16:46.291 --> 16:48.083
They came when I was inside.

16:48.166 --> 16:51.083
-There.
-And your brother?

16:51.166 --> 16:54.833
Same. The pigs were in there.
It's like they knew it.

16:54.916 --> 16:57.791
Hold on, man!
What do you mean, they knew it?

16:57.875 --> 17:00.125
Where were you? From the beginning.

17:00.208 --> 17:03.500
They may have followed you.
Why didn't they act before?

17:03.583 --> 17:04.541
I pay attention.

17:04.625 --> 17:06.291
There was nothing on the way

17:06.375 --> 17:08.375
indicating we were being followed.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.583
Let's keep our eyes open.

17:10.666 --> 17:12.916
We've got a rat.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.750
Some motherfucker is ratting us out.

17:15.833 --> 17:18.000
Think this is an inside job?

17:18.083 --> 17:20.958
Yeah. How would they know all that?

17:21.041 --> 17:22.708
Time and place, everything.

17:22.791 --> 17:25.583
Our brother is on the line hearing us.

17:25.666 --> 17:28.291
-What's up, family?
-Hey.

17:28.375 --> 17:30.708
So the same thing happened here.

17:30.791 --> 17:33.208
They knew everything.

17:33.291 --> 17:35.583
Like they scouted the place.

17:35.666 --> 17:38.541
That doesn't feel right, man.
It doesn't add up.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.250
It sounds strange.

17:40.333 --> 17:42.291
They went straight to the target.

17:42.375 --> 17:44.000
Dinho, something's fishy.

17:44.083 --> 17:44.916
Yeah, brother.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.041
One of us is working for them.
We need to fix this.

17:48.125 --> 17:50.416
They'll pay. You know how.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.458
-That's right. Checkmate.
-Yeah, get them popped.

18:07.208 --> 18:08.791
Guys, here's the deal.

18:08.875 --> 18:10.666
The DJ will drive there.

18:10.750 --> 18:13.208
At 7:00 pm, we open in Jundiaí.

18:13.291 --> 18:16.666
An agricultural fair,
20-minute performance.

18:16.750 --> 18:21.375
At 8:30 pm, we'll be in Itu
for the mayor's daughter's birthday party.

18:21.458 --> 18:24.625
At 10:00 pm, Jaguariúna, local fest.

18:24.708 --> 18:28.291
Midnight in Piracicaba.
That'll be a nightclub.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.625
On stage for 30 to 40 minutes, okay?

18:30.708 --> 18:34.125
We wrap it up at 1:30 am in Campinas.

18:34.875 --> 18:36.791
Don't worry. It'll work out.

18:37.291 --> 18:39.083
That's fine. We're cool.

18:39.166 --> 18:41.208
You should be cool at your age.

18:43.083 --> 18:45.500
You can use this between performances.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.666
You might need it.

18:48.625 --> 18:51.541
Driver, step on it, or we'll be late.

18:52.416 --> 18:54.041
What about Tally's party?

18:54.791 --> 18:57.375
She'll get there at 2:30 am. It's fine.

19:23.375 --> 19:24.708
All good, brother?

19:24.791 --> 19:26.208
It's not fucking good.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.458
Your pals steal my load
and you still want money?

19:29.541 --> 19:33.041
What pals, man?
I don't know what's going on.

19:33.125 --> 19:34.791
That's your problem.

19:35.833 --> 19:37.708
What the fuck? It's not my guys.

19:37.791 --> 19:39.000
Tell your boss that.

19:39.083 --> 19:41.833
From now on, you talk directly to me.

19:43.333 --> 19:46.875
I want the names of the cops
and the name of the rat.

19:46.958 --> 19:48.375
That's your mission.

20:04.583 --> 20:06.166
Rita, Levi.

20:06.666 --> 20:08.541
You're doing God's work.

20:08.625 --> 20:09.666
Praise be.

20:09.750 --> 20:10.833
May God bless us.

20:10.916 --> 20:11.791
-Amen.
-Amen.

20:11.875 --> 20:13.583
-Bye, guys.
-Good job.

20:15.375 --> 20:16.750
We gave it all away.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.250
Yeah.

20:19.166 --> 20:20.041
And now?

20:20.125 --> 20:22.541
I'm going home to rest.
I'm working tomorrow.

20:22.625 --> 20:23.750
I'm exhausted.

20:24.791 --> 20:25.916
Want a ride?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.750
Don't worry. It's fine.

20:27.833 --> 20:28.833
Come on, Rita.

20:28.916 --> 20:30.958
I'm taking two volunteers to the bus stop.

20:31.458 --> 20:34.333
My mom would be mad
if I didn't take you home.

20:34.416 --> 20:37.208
Yeah? She tells you
to give rides to strangers?

20:38.666 --> 20:40.208
We are not strangers.

20:42.541 --> 20:45.875
Well, let me just see
if everything is sorted.

20:45.958 --> 20:46.833
Okay.

20:46.916 --> 20:49.208
SOLIDARITY NETWORK

20:49.291 --> 20:50.666
Guys, everything okay?

20:50.750 --> 20:54.541
Bro, the bar owners,
the food stand owners,

20:54.625 --> 20:57.250
everyone's mad there's no more balls.

20:57.333 --> 21:01.333
-Who's messing with us?
-Jussara is coming. Shit.

21:01.416 --> 21:03.416
-It's Jussara.
-Don't start.

21:03.500 --> 21:07.458
-I want to talk to your boss!
-No, I'm in charge.

21:07.541 --> 21:10.458
Brother, careful with her.
Don't flake on me.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.291
My God…

21:12.875 --> 21:14.291
Did she eat by herself?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.458
She's a big girl.

21:18.750 --> 21:21.291
-Fernando. It's Rose.
-I just wanna work.

21:21.375 --> 21:24.125
-We need to talk.
-I'm not going anywhere.

21:24.208 --> 21:26.541
-That's ridiculous!
-One second.

21:29.958 --> 21:32.500
Formiga, you need to calm them down.

21:33.375 --> 21:36.208
Tell Jussara to chill.
I'll be right there.

21:36.291 --> 21:37.708
Alright, brother. Later.

21:41.625 --> 21:43.250
How's she doing in school?

21:43.750 --> 21:46.416
Great, but the semester is almost over.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.750
-We need a nanny.
-Okay.

21:49.916 --> 21:51.500
We need to talk too.

21:52.166 --> 21:55.083
-Will you be long?
-No, I'll be right back.

21:55.750 --> 21:57.583
Find the nanny and let me know.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.083
A kiss.

22:06.666 --> 22:08.083
-Kisses.
-Bye.

22:17.833 --> 22:20.250
-Evening, Auntie.
-Evening, Luiz Fernando.

22:20.333 --> 22:22.833
-We need to talk.
-Go ahead.

22:22.916 --> 22:25.291
We want to understand the ball thing.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.750
We were told to stop, but nobody asked us.

22:28.833 --> 22:31.041
Calm down. It's a mess, you know.

22:31.125 --> 22:34.750
Exactly. You need to understand
there are many points of view.

22:34.833 --> 22:37.833
I talked to many people.
They say the same thing.

22:37.916 --> 22:41.125
-I didn't decide that alone.
-Wait a minute.

22:41.208 --> 22:42.916
No one asked me anything.

22:43.916 --> 22:46.291
He said he talked to people, but not me.

22:48.083 --> 22:50.958
Jussara works at the ball. Right, Ju?

22:51.708 --> 22:53.458
It's important for vendors.

22:54.125 --> 22:56.125
They're working to pay the bills.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.750
It's disrupting the lives of many people.

22:58.833 --> 23:01.541
I'm sorry, but I've made my decision.

23:01.625 --> 23:03.875
-Fernando…
-Hold on, Rose.

23:03.958 --> 23:06.833
Okay, and what do you want now?

23:06.916 --> 23:09.958
To take the money from working people?

23:10.041 --> 23:12.083
Everyone knows.

23:12.166 --> 23:15.958
Many parents in the community
make money with the balls.

23:16.041 --> 23:17.500
I work all week,

23:17.583 --> 23:19.958
but what I make doesn't cut it.

23:20.041 --> 23:22.291
I need that money.

23:22.375 --> 23:25.041
And you cancel it without warning.

23:25.125 --> 23:28.166
You take away the place
the kids go to overnight,

23:28.250 --> 23:29.750
they can't have fun.

23:29.833 --> 23:32.083
Where will the kids go?

23:32.166 --> 23:34.500
-You can't do that.
-Jussara, calm down.

23:34.583 --> 23:35.416
I'm calm.

23:35.500 --> 23:38.000
We're not fighting here, okay?

23:38.083 --> 23:40.833
I'm just explaining. Respect me. I'm calm.

23:40.916 --> 23:42.000
Calm down.

23:42.083 --> 23:44.250
-Be quiet, okay?
-When it's for them…

23:44.333 --> 23:45.625
Do you see?

23:45.708 --> 23:48.000
When it's for you, we're fine.

23:48.083 --> 23:50.916
-When it's for us, you do that.
-Calm down.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.416
I'm just trying to say my piece.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.833
-Calm down!
-You want things your way.

23:55.916 --> 23:59.208
-And you ignore other people.
-She won't stop talking.

23:59.291 --> 24:01.208
-Who asked you?
-Stop talking.

24:01.291 --> 24:02.791
I'm not talking to you!

24:02.875 --> 24:04.333
This is between us!

24:04.416 --> 24:05.500
Be respectful!

24:05.583 --> 24:08.041
-You need to show respect.
-You're wrong!

24:08.125 --> 24:09.791
We're talking.

24:09.875 --> 24:12.291
Are you calling me crazy? Fine.

24:12.375 --> 24:14.083
-It's just my opinion.
-Quiet.

24:14.166 --> 24:16.500
-That's all.
-Man, calm down.

24:17.250 --> 24:18.125
Yes, Auntie?

24:18.208 --> 24:21.583
-I want to reach a compromise.
-Yeah, that's all.

24:22.166 --> 24:25.416
It's not personal.
I don't like balls. You know that.

24:25.916 --> 24:30.291
We need to think it through
and organize it, okay?

24:30.375 --> 24:33.083
We've got to think of the community.

24:33.166 --> 24:35.125
The cops are always there.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.875
I'm getting complaints.

24:36.958 --> 24:40.000
I won't go out of my way
to fix stupid problems.

24:40.083 --> 24:43.083
People are complaining.
Everyone comes to me.

24:43.166 --> 24:45.458
You know I can talk to them.

24:45.541 --> 24:47.958
If we do everything right, we'll be fine.

24:48.916 --> 24:50.833
-I'll think about it.
-Please.

24:50.916 --> 24:54.500
You can talk to Formigão.
He's the one in charge.

24:54.583 --> 24:55.791
-Okay?
-Okay.

24:55.875 --> 24:56.958
-Thanks.
-Godspeed.

24:57.625 --> 24:58.625
Take care.

24:59.541 --> 25:00.666
Think about it.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.041
Okay. Good night.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.458
Good night, Formigão. Good night, Jaque.

25:07.791 --> 25:08.666
Come on, Ju.

25:09.916 --> 25:10.875
Let's go.

25:11.375 --> 25:13.708
-We didn't solve anything.
-We sure did.

25:13.791 --> 25:15.875
-It's all talk.
-He'll consider it.

25:15.958 --> 25:18.375
I work, Rose. I just want my money.

25:18.458 --> 25:20.791
-That's all.
-But if you scream…

25:20.875 --> 25:24.208
I'm not screaming.
You gotta make yourself heard.

25:29.750 --> 25:32.458
-Thanks for the ride, Levi.
-Come on, Rita.

25:32.541 --> 25:33.875
You brought me here.

25:33.958 --> 25:37.666
I insist on buying you
the best cheeseburger of your life!

25:37.750 --> 25:38.791
Yeah?

25:38.875 --> 25:41.000
We call it X-burger in Brazil

25:41.083 --> 25:43.291
because the word "cheese"

25:43.375 --> 25:46.500
sounds like an X,
but that's not how you write it.

25:46.583 --> 25:48.291
It means a burger with cheese.

25:48.375 --> 25:50.958
Calling Auntie Sonia's burger that

25:51.041 --> 25:52.250
is almost a sin.

25:52.333 --> 25:55.208
I doubt theirs is as good.

25:55.291 --> 25:57.041
-Let's go, then?
-Let's.

26:00.666 --> 26:02.125
Auntie, how are you?

26:02.208 --> 26:04.416
-Been a long time!
-Hi, how are you?

26:04.500 --> 26:07.166
We'd like two special cheeseburgers.

26:07.250 --> 26:08.125
That's right.

26:08.208 --> 26:11.250
The special one has everything on it.

26:11.333 --> 26:12.625
My God, Rita.

26:13.583 --> 26:17.125
It's delicious.
Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.

26:17.208 --> 26:19.916
-You'll fall in love.
-I think so.

26:22.291 --> 26:24.041
And a soda, please.

26:24.125 --> 26:24.958
You got it.

26:26.666 --> 26:28.375
You know everyone, Rita.

26:28.958 --> 26:30.125
Here you go.

26:30.208 --> 26:31.416
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.708
I grew up here.

26:34.291 --> 26:35.125
Well…

26:36.250 --> 26:37.583
This is too much.

26:38.458 --> 26:41.125
-Ready for a true cheeseburger?
-I think so.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.500
-Let's do it?
-Let's.

26:53.875 --> 26:57.000
I always wanted to live abroad,
live my own life.

26:58.208 --> 27:00.000
I wanted to stay there.

27:00.083 --> 27:02.416
I don't know. I felt free.

27:02.500 --> 27:05.833
But Pastor Leopoldo wanted me back.

27:05.916 --> 27:07.250
He's got plans for me.

27:07.333 --> 27:09.708
Having a father like that must be great.

27:10.750 --> 27:14.000
He sends you away, but he calls you back.

27:14.583 --> 27:19.000
I like it,
but after living alone for three years,

27:19.083 --> 27:21.791
moving back home feels a bit strange.

27:22.583 --> 27:23.500
Imagine that.

27:24.541 --> 27:26.625
No, I can't imagine it.

27:27.458 --> 27:29.125
I've lived alone since I was 15.

27:38.375 --> 27:39.458
Rita?

27:48.750 --> 27:50.875
Everything okay?
Did I say something wrong?

27:51.541 --> 27:53.583
This was Pastor Sueli's church.

27:54.750 --> 27:57.916
You know when you're totally lost?

27:59.041 --> 28:00.958
This is where they took me in.

28:02.125 --> 28:04.875
They showed me another path. My path.

28:06.250 --> 28:09.958
Anyways, the owner wanted it back,
and we lost the congregation.

28:11.166 --> 28:13.416
-Does my father know that?
-Yes, sure.

28:13.500 --> 28:17.625
He's helping us with rent for a new space.

28:18.208 --> 28:20.083
-What else?
-That's it.

28:20.750 --> 28:22.416
We need to remodel it.

28:23.541 --> 28:24.458
I see.

28:25.458 --> 28:28.125
And do you need help?

28:28.625 --> 28:30.625
Do you know how much it'll cost?

28:30.708 --> 28:33.750
I have no idea.
But it's probably expensive.

28:33.833 --> 28:35.375
It's an old warehouse.

28:35.958 --> 28:38.250
I don't know how to do that yet.

28:40.208 --> 28:42.708
But I wanted to reopen the church.

28:42.791 --> 28:45.458
I wanted it to be beautiful and perfect.

28:46.375 --> 28:47.500
Wait.

28:48.083 --> 28:51.666
Didn't you manage to triple
the church's donations

28:52.250 --> 28:53.583
almost overnight?

28:55.208 --> 28:56.041
Rita,

28:56.708 --> 28:59.958
for you, money is not a problem.
It's the solution.

29:09.250 --> 29:11.875
Hey, Jundiaí, Doni's in the area.

29:11.958 --> 29:14.083
What's up!

29:14.166 --> 29:17.333
The show's in ten minutes, alright?

29:18.125 --> 29:21.833
What's up, Itu? We're in the area
to bring the house down.

29:22.291 --> 29:25.708
Hey, Itu, let's bring the house down

29:25.791 --> 29:29.250
Hey, Itu, let's bring the house down

29:31.041 --> 29:33.708
Hey, Jaguariúna. We're on our way.

29:34.375 --> 29:36.375
-Hey…
-Jaguariúna!

29:40.708 --> 29:42.583
Piracicaba, we're almost there.

29:42.666 --> 29:46.125
I hope no one's tired.
We're gonna have a blast.

29:46.208 --> 29:47.041
Later.

29:52.375 --> 29:53.375
Marcão,

29:54.291 --> 29:55.458
where are we going?

29:55.541 --> 29:57.666
We're going to Campinas.

30:00.208 --> 30:01.625
What's up, Campinas?

30:01.708 --> 30:03.958
We're coming to bring the house down.

30:04.041 --> 30:05.458
See you soon!

30:08.125 --> 30:10.083
It's the last one.

30:10.166 --> 30:12.916
-Hallelujah!
-It's a blessing.

30:25.958 --> 30:28.041
Hey, man. Are you okay?

30:28.625 --> 30:30.625
-I'm good.
-Okay.

30:36.583 --> 30:37.708
It's a dream, Marcão.

30:40.250 --> 30:41.583
Wanted this my whole life.

30:42.416 --> 30:43.958
I hear you, man.

30:45.458 --> 30:48.250
I've been in this business for a while.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
I always like having new people.

30:52.458 --> 30:54.291
The beginning is the best part.

30:54.375 --> 30:55.291
Man,

30:55.958 --> 30:57.583
I'm glad you're having fun.

30:57.666 --> 30:58.750
Thanks.

30:58.833 --> 31:00.041
You have a gift.

31:02.041 --> 31:02.875
Listen.

31:02.958 --> 31:05.958
Could the driver drop me off
in Vila Olímpia?

31:06.041 --> 31:08.083
I'm going to a friend's party.

31:08.958 --> 31:12.583
Now that this is your job,
you can't be going to nightclubs.

31:13.250 --> 31:15.125
You're a VIP. You gotta get paid.

31:15.208 --> 31:17.833
If you just show up, they won't pay.

31:18.458 --> 31:20.000
One other thing.

31:20.916 --> 31:23.750
You can't keep advertising
your friends' shop.

31:24.750 --> 31:28.833
All clothes and branding
need to be approved by Luan.

31:29.458 --> 31:30.666
Alright?

31:32.625 --> 31:34.500
-Alright.
-Cool.

31:35.041 --> 31:36.541
They passed out.

31:37.791 --> 31:40.958
COMING BACK FROM CONCERTS
I MAY NOT MAKE IT

31:41.041 --> 31:43.416
TYPING…

31:43.500 --> 31:46.958
I'M POSTING, BUT THE PARTY SUCKS.

31:47.041 --> 31:50.541
YOU'RE NOT MISSING OUT

31:50.625 --> 31:53.958
COME OVER FOR AN AFTER-PARTY.

31:54.041 --> 31:55.791
BRING YOUR FRIENDS

31:58.208 --> 32:00.083
PARTY?

32:09.625 --> 32:10.625
Wake up.

32:11.416 --> 32:13.625
You too. We got people coming over.

32:14.833 --> 32:17.708
-I'll get the drinks.
-Yes, Marcão.

32:19.583 --> 32:20.833
Wake up, man.

32:21.625 --> 32:23.916
FAMILY GROUP
AWESOME

32:24.000 --> 32:26.625
I LOVE YOU, BROTHER

32:31.416 --> 32:32.333
Sorry.

32:38.375 --> 32:39.375
Honey…

32:44.125 --> 32:46.000
remember that I wanted to talk?

32:47.583 --> 32:48.791
I'm pregnant.

32:49.625 --> 32:50.875
Three months.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.458
I couldn't tell you.

33:08.166 --> 33:09.166
Scheyla,

33:10.333 --> 33:11.750
everything will be okay.

33:25.791 --> 33:29.208
Up! Come, Marcão.

33:29.291 --> 33:31.000
Come, Marcão.

33:31.083 --> 33:33.750
Marcão, look how Rivaldinho moves.

33:33.833 --> 33:34.666
Go, Rivaldo.

33:37.375 --> 33:38.333
I see it.

33:40.250 --> 33:42.291
Man, Tally blew me off.

33:42.375 --> 33:44.750
I think she's not coming.

33:44.833 --> 33:46.000
Don't worry.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.708
HEY!

33:50.666 --> 33:51.750
I'M HERE!

33:53.416 --> 33:54.458
Excuse me.

34:12.541 --> 34:15.375
I'm glad you came.
I thought you'd stood me up.

34:15.458 --> 34:18.083
Funny. You stood me up at the party.

34:18.583 --> 34:19.583
No.

34:21.208 --> 34:25.041
Kidding. I just had to choose
who I'd bring and leave.

34:25.125 --> 34:27.041
-I see.
-The music sucked.

34:27.125 --> 34:28.083
It was bad.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.000
At least the music's good here.

34:30.666 --> 34:32.458
I moved in recently.

34:32.541 --> 34:34.958
It needs work, but make yourself at home.

34:35.041 --> 34:37.958
-I like your place. It's cute.
-Really?

34:38.875 --> 34:40.833
-Want something to drink?
-Yes.

34:40.916 --> 34:41.750
What you got?

34:42.250 --> 34:46.000
Beer, vodka, whiskey, coconut water ice.

34:46.625 --> 34:48.000
You got rosé?

34:49.041 --> 34:49.916
Okay.

34:56.208 --> 34:57.750
-Marcão?
-Hey, man.

34:57.833 --> 34:59.250
-You cool?
-Cool.

34:59.333 --> 35:01.375
Can you get some rosé?

35:02.125 --> 35:03.666
This late, man?

35:04.166 --> 35:07.416
I'll let you have five bottles
from the next five balls.

35:09.083 --> 35:10.125
Five, huh?

36:09.041 --> 36:12.083
Man, Rivaldo blacked out in the bathroom.

36:12.166 --> 36:14.833
He threw up everywhere,
even inside the Jacuzzi.

36:14.916 --> 36:16.166
He's messed up.

36:16.250 --> 36:18.333
Classic. Go help your friend.

36:19.333 --> 36:21.000
You screwed up, man.

36:21.083 --> 36:22.583
I love you guys.

36:22.666 --> 36:25.750
-You always do that.
-Don't talk like that.

36:25.833 --> 36:27.583
-Where's…
-Rivaldo.

36:27.666 --> 36:30.166
Did you and Tally make out?

36:30.250 --> 36:32.791
-How's your friend?
-That's Tally!

36:33.583 --> 36:35.958
-It's fine. Let's go outside.
-Man…

36:36.041 --> 36:38.625
-Did you see…
-Don't cry.

36:44.500 --> 36:47.041
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

36:47.125 --> 36:49.708
I got a car to take your friends home.

36:49.791 --> 36:52.666
I'm going home too. I'm exhausted.

36:52.750 --> 36:54.000
There's more wine.

36:54.083 --> 36:55.000
-Thanks.
-Cool?

36:55.750 --> 36:56.958
Take it easy, man.

36:57.041 --> 36:59.500
There's more tomorrow, which is today.

37:01.291 --> 37:03.875
-Bye, Tally.
-Thank you. I mean it.

37:05.708 --> 37:07.041
He's funny, right?

37:12.500 --> 37:14.916
It must feel great to conquer all this.

37:16.125 --> 37:18.875
It's cool. But you've got everything.

37:19.375 --> 37:22.041
It's different. I was born into it.

37:23.666 --> 37:24.833
Where are you from?

37:27.291 --> 37:28.833
Vila Áurea. You know it?

37:30.041 --> 37:31.291
I know of it.

37:32.041 --> 37:34.041
Don't lie. You don't know it.

37:35.083 --> 37:37.458
So tell me about it. I don't know.

37:38.083 --> 37:40.125
I can't explain. It's like here.

37:40.208 --> 37:43.083
But we all know and visit each other.

37:43.166 --> 37:44.750
Like a giant family.

37:45.208 --> 37:47.916
-It's the opposite of my neighborhood.
-Really?

37:48.416 --> 37:51.625
Once, I took the elevator.
There was an old lady there.

37:51.708 --> 37:54.708
She saw me, but she stared at the ceiling.

37:54.791 --> 37:58.041
Like there was something up there.
She ignored me.

38:17.958 --> 38:21.000
The farmer's market
is great here, Donizete.

38:25.208 --> 38:26.250
Good morning.

42:14.333 --> 42:18.250
