Cowboy Day, cowpoke!

00:15.583 --> 00:17.416
- Not today, weirdo.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.450
- [knocking on door]

00:18.452 --> 00:21.020
Wakey-wakey!
Eggs 'n bakey!

00:21.022 --> 00:23.989
- Not today,
other weirdo.

00:23.991 --> 00:26.225
- Max, this just
got delivered.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.192
- Hopefully,
it's a gift card

00:27.194 --> 00:29.061
for you to get
a new outfit.

00:29.063 --> 00:32.331
That one is

will find out

00:38.539 --> 00:40.606
if you've made
the Z Force Championships.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.341
Superheroes
never get days off,

00:42.343 --> 00:44.309
but, today,
you have earned one.

00:44.311 --> 00:47.112
So, have fun
and enjoy yourselves.

00:47.114 --> 00:47.946
That's an order!

00:47.948 --> 00:49.448
- Wow, Max,
we finally find out

00:49.450 --> 00:52.351
if we get into the Z Force
Championships tomorrow.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.385
And we get a day off.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.353
- Which leaves
you plenty of time

00:54.355 --> 00:58.090
to change outta that
sleeveless garbage bag.

00:58.959 --> 01:01.960
- Phoebe, what if we don't
get chosen for the Z Force?

01:01.962 --> 01:03.429
We'll lose our one
shot at greatness.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.330
Dad needs to know
we're better than him.

01:05.332 --> 01:07.933
- [laughs] Come on,
Max, look at us.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.201
We're an
unstoppable team.

01:09.203 --> 01:11.937
Now let's go
have some fun.

01:11.939 --> 01:12.938
- [laughs]
All right.

01:12.940 --> 01:13.839
But you heard
that hologram.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.208
We're off duty,
so, that means no saves.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.544
- Not even kittens
in trees?

01:18.546 --> 01:21.146
- Especially,
kittens in trees.

01:24.552 --> 01:28.420
- ¶

01:28.422 --> 01:29.688
- You two are
just in time

01:29.690 --> 01:31.557
to witness
a breakfast miracle.

01:31.559 --> 01:34.026
- Behold! The thing
I'm most proud of

01:34.028 --> 01:36.061
in the entire world!

01:37.098 --> 01:39.364
Besides my
wonderful children.

- Uh-uh-uh!

01:45.139 --> 01:47.573
Leave that kitten
in the tree, Phoebe.

01:48.309 --> 01:52.344
Sorry, guys, Z Force ordered
us to take a day off.

01:53.114 --> 01:53.645
- But...

01:53.647 --> 01:55.681
- NORA: So, is anyone
gonna save us?

01:55.683 --> 01:58.450
- Thunder Man
to the rescue!

01:58.452 --> 02:01.353
Mmmm!
[chomping]

02:01.355 --> 02:03.522

- [sharp thwack]
- Ow!

against the Marine Teens.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.306
- You guys had
it last week.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.675
- No. Listen, Bradford
promised us the cafeteria,

02:23.677 --> 02:25.611
and we need to get
our lobster bros

02:25.613 --> 02:27.346
into some salty H2O.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.981
- [claws snapping]

02:28.983 --> 02:31.383
- Ja, backoffsen.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.418
- But Principal Bradford
promised

02:33.420 --> 02:35.454
we could use
the cafeteria.

02:35.456 --> 02:36.755
So, you Marine Teens,

02:36.757 --> 02:39.024
make like a rubber
tree and bounce.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.727
- How dare you!
- CROWD: [mixed comments]

02:41.729 --> 02:44.563
- Fight! Fight! Fight!
[laughing]

02:44.565 --> 02:46.098
- Let me guess,
Principal Bradford.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.566
You double-booked
the cafeteria.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.568
- Actually,
I triple-booked it.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.070
Isn't that right,
Tambourine Teens?

02:52.072 --> 02:54.139
- [tambourines jingling]

02:55.576 --> 02:57.009

02:57.011 --> 02:59.578
That's right,
I'm a bad boy.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.313
Tell your moms.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.215
Wooooo!

03:03.217 --> 03:05.050
Ah! Ah! Ah!

03:13.360 --> 03:15.394
Don't tell
your moms about this!

03:15.396 --> 03:18.163
Oh, no!
Waaaaaa!

03:19.099 --> 03:21.266
- Wow, who knew
not saving people

03:21.268 --> 03:23.735
could be so
entertaining?

03:23.737 --> 03:26.605
- ¶

03:26.607 --> 03:29.608
- It's packed.
- We might not get a table.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.577
Oh, this one's leaving.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.545
- Ladies,
don't leave yet.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.380
The dessert
just got here.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.349
[laughing]

03:37.351 --> 03:39.451
Me. I'm the dessert.
[laughs]

03:39.453 --> 03:41.420
- Beat it, loser.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.655
- PHOEBE:
[laughs]

03:43.657 --> 03:46.124
It's funny
'cause you failed.

03:46.293 --> 03:48.727
- Oh, look, my two
favorite people.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.429
- MAX & PHOEBE:
What do you want, Wong?

03:50.431 --> 03:54.066
- Oh, the local restaurant
blogger is here.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.202
I'm way understaffed
and if his service stinks,

03:57.204 --> 03:59.404
he'll give me
a bad review.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.439
I'll be ruined.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.673
- Sorry, we'd love
to help you,

04:01.675 --> 04:04.343
but we've been forced
to take the day off.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.244
- By who?

04:05.246 --> 04:07.412
- Uhhh, by our doctors.
- Yes.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.146
- We're very sick.

04:08.148 --> 04:10.115
You might want
to keep your distance...

04:10.117 --> 04:11.450
[laughs]
forever.

04:11.452 --> 04:15.554
- Hmph! After all
I haven't done for you!

04:16.390 --> 04:18.257
[screaming]

04:20.828 --> 04:23.328
- You know what's good
about this restaurant?

04:23.330 --> 04:25.330
Nothing!
- Oh!

04:26.533 --> 04:29.134
- She just put the splat
in Splatburger.

04:29.136 --> 04:30.802
- BOTH:
[laughing]

04:30.804 --> 04:32.871
- Oh, no, come back.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.406

04:34.408 --> 04:37.542
- You know, I'm actually kinda
bummed our day off is over.

04:37.544 --> 04:38.277
- Me, too.

04:38.279 --> 04:39.411
Although I could
have done without

04:39.413 --> 04:41.179
your snorty laughs
and pointy elbow jabs.

04:41.181 --> 04:42.180
- [laughing]
All right.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.548
Well, let's get some
sleep, wake up,

04:43.550 --> 04:45.751
and see if we
made the Championships.

for some reason,

05:00.901 --> 05:02.834
I'm wearing the same
clothes as yesterday,

05:02.836 --> 05:04.836

it's a gift card

a new outfit.

05:07.841 --> 05:11.510
That one is so

case of deja vu.

05:14.315 --> 05:14.880
- Me, too.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.415
Maybe this one
is telling us

05:16.417 --> 05:18.817
if we got into
the Championships or not.

My dreams are way
better than yours.

- COLOSSO:
Yeeeee-ha!

09:02.543 --> 09:06.645
Happy National
Cowboy Day, cowpoke!

09:07.781 --> 09:08.980
- It's still
yesterday, Max.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.883
- I know, but when we get
to tomorrow, it'll be tomorrow.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.085
- COLOSSO:
Yeeeee-ha!

09:14.087 --> 09:17.422
Happy National
Cowboy Day, cowpoke!

09:18.525 --> 09:19.424
- Still yesterday, Max.

09:19.426 --> 09:22.093
- I know, but tomorrow
will definitely be tomorrow.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.629
- Yeeeee-ha!

09:24.631 --> 09:27.666
Happy National
Cowboy Day, cowpoke.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.869
- Why is it
still yesterday?!

09:30.871 --> 09:32.103
- I don't know!

09:32.105 --> 09:32.737
- [sighing]

09:32.739 --> 09:35.840
- I have no idea what either
of you are talking about.

09:35.842 --> 09:38.743
But Phoebe's outfit
is dumb.

09:40.414 --> 09:41.713
- You know, maybe
it's not a coincidence

09:41.715 --> 09:43.181
that we're stuck
reliving the same day,

09:43.183 --> 09:45.450
the day before
the Z Force Championships.

09:45.452 --> 09:46.718
- Why this day, though?

09:46.720 --> 09:47.519
Why can't it be the day

09:47.521 --> 09:49.521
you got your braces
caught in that fence?

09:49.523 --> 09:50.455
- Hey, that is not funny.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.924
It took them three hours
to cut me loose.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.694
Z Force must be doing
this for a reason.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.562
Maybe we should call
President Kickbutt for help.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.631
- Well, why would
the Z Force mess with us,

09:59.633 --> 10:03.134
unless it was some
kind of test?

10:03.136 --> 10:04.469
- Ooh, I like tests.

10:04.471 --> 10:06.471
- I know you do.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.106
But if it was a test,

10:08.108 --> 10:10.675
then asking for help
would be like cheating,

10:10.677 --> 10:11.776
and you don't cheat.

10:11.778 --> 10:12.844
Do you, Phoebe?
- No way.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.613
I'd rather practice
kissing that fence again.

10:14.615 --> 10:15.847
- I knew that's
what you were doing!

10:15.849 --> 10:19.050
- Yeah, yeah, okay,
let's stay on track here.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.520
If this is a Z Force test,
how do we pass it?

10:22.522 --> 10:24.889
- Well...they said to
enjoy your day off.

10:24.891 --> 10:27.692
Maybe they just want us to
have the most fun day ever.

10:27.694 --> 10:29.628
- Max, it's called
the Z Force,

10:29.630 --> 10:31.229
not the Whee Force!

10:31.765 --> 10:33.531
- Well, it was
a direct order,

10:33.533 --> 10:37.569
and the only thing you
like more than a test

10:37.571 --> 10:38.903
is a direct order.

10:38.905 --> 10:39.738
- All right, fine.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.473
If having fun
will end this day,

10:41.475 --> 10:43.575
then fun we shall have!

10:43.944 --> 10:46.578
- Pancake!
- HANK: [gasps]

10:46.580 --> 10:52.817
- ¶

10:52.819 --> 10:54.919
- Hey!
- Ahhhh!

10:54.921 --> 10:58.156
- ¶

10:58.158 --> 11:00.859
- Oh! Oh!

11:00.861 --> 11:01.993
Ah!

11:01.995 --> 11:03.928
- [claws snapping]

11:03.930 --> 11:05.764
- ¶

11:05.766 --> 11:06.531
- Ohhh...

11:06.533 --> 11:10.201
- What is up, Splatburger?
- [dance music playing]

11:10.203 --> 11:12.570
- Who's ready for
a dance party?

11:12.572 --> 11:13.772
- I am not!

11:13.774 --> 11:16.041
- Come on, everybody,
get up! Let's go!

11:16.043 --> 11:17.942
Yeah, off your butts!

11:17.944 --> 11:19.811
¶ Everybody say hey ¶

11:19.813 --> 11:20.745
- ¶ Hey ¶

11:20.747 --> 11:22.213
- ¶ Everybody say ho ¶

11:22.215 --> 11:23.014
- ¶ Ho ¶

11:23.016 --> 11:24.115
- Everybody say get out

11:24.117 --> 11:25.550
before I hit you
with this broom!

11:25.552 --> 11:27.552
- ¶ Get out before
I hit you with-- ¶

11:27.554 --> 11:29.120
Oh, wait,
she's serious. Run!

11:29.122 --> 11:31.289
- MRS. WONG:
Ahhhhhh!

11:33.126 --> 11:35.560
- [sighing]
Now that was a day off.

11:35.562 --> 11:38.029
Getting hit with that
broom was so worth it.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.699
- Don't forget about
riding an elephant at the zoo,

11:40.701 --> 11:41.733
riding a rhino
at the zoo...

11:41.735 --> 11:43.702
[laughs] getting
kicked out of the zoo.

11:43.704 --> 11:44.569
Good times.

11:44.571 --> 11:45.637
- We've achieved
maximum fun,

11:45.639 --> 11:47.238
and now that we've
aced the Z Force test,

11:47.240 --> 11:50.909
when we wake up, tomorrow
will finally be tomorrow.

11:50.911 --> 11:54.913
- ¶

11:54.915 --> 11:57.148
- COLOSSO:
Yeeeee-ha!

11:57.150 --> 12:00.652
Happy National
Cowboy Day, cowpoke!

12:01.988 --> 12:02.787
- [sighing]

12:02.789 --> 12:05.023
Why isn't this
day over?

12:05.025 --> 12:07.992
- Why don't I hit
you with a lasso,

12:07.994 --> 12:10.729
dearie?

12:10.731 --> 12:11.963
[chuckling]

12:11.965 --> 12:12.831
- I don't get it.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.266
We had the most fun a person
could possibly have

12:15.268 --> 12:16.735
in one day
and it didn't help.

12:16.737 --> 12:19.838
We must be interpreting the
Z Force message the wrong way.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.740
- Well, it's pretty
clear, Phoebe.

12:21.742 --> 12:24.075
It said, go have fun
and enjoy yourself.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.577
Let's go back
to that zoo,

12:25.579 --> 12:29.280
and this time, we both get
in the kangaroo's pouch.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.951
- Wait, that
message also said

12:32.953 --> 12:35.153
superheroes never
take days off.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.054
[gasping]
Oh, no!

12:36.056 --> 12:39.023
What if we've been following
the wrong direct order?

12:39.025 --> 12:40.191
[wheezing]

12:40.193 --> 12:42.293
- Just breathe, nerd.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.163
- No, Max, I think the Z Force
wants us to prove to them

12:45.165 --> 12:48.032
that we know a true superhero
never takes a vacation day.

12:48.034 --> 12:50.769
I think we're supposed
to be saving people.

12:50.771 --> 12:53.671
- Mmmm. My plan
is kangaroos.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.941
Fine, we'll do
your thing.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.711
- You two are
just in time

12:59.713 --> 13:01.813
to witness
a breakfast miracle.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.315
- Behold! The thing
I'm most proud of

13:04.317 --> 13:05.316
in the entire world!

13:05.318 --> 13:07.318
Besides my
wonderful children.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.988
- [whooshing] Pancake!
- HANK: [gasps]

13:12.025 --> 13:13.625
- BILLY:
Cool! Flying breakfast.

13:13.627 --> 13:16.761
- Yeah, it'd be even cooler
if we could eat it.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.098
- Whoa, that was close.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.699
- Yeah, it's almost
like you two

13:21.701 --> 13:23.668
knew that was
gonna happen.

13:23.670 --> 13:24.536
- Yeah, it's
'cause we did.

13:24.538 --> 13:26.104
- Yeah, you see, we're
caught in a time loop,

13:26.106 --> 13:28.807
and we keep repeating the same
day over and over again.

13:28.809 --> 13:32.010
- Oh, you kids.
So creative.

13:35.749 --> 13:36.915
- CROWD:
[mixed comments]

13:36.917 --> 13:38.349
- Okay, first, we're
gonna make peace

13:38.351 --> 13:40.652
between these
two angry clubs.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.388
And then,
if they don't fight,

13:43.390 --> 13:45.056
Bradford won't do his
weird bad boy dance

13:45.058 --> 13:47.325
into the lobsters
and everybody's saved.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.092
- That's too bad.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.962
I do enjoy watching Bradford
become lobster food.

13:50.964 --> 13:54.299
- Yeah, that's
gonna be a tough one.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.701
Anyway, showtime.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.736
- CROWD:
[mixed comments]

13:58.738 --> 13:59.237
- Guys!

13:59.239 --> 14:02.073
Listen, there has to be
a more calm way to resolve this.

14:02.075 --> 14:02.974
- It's too late, Phoebe.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.243
The Wolfgang
is out of the cage.

14:05.245 --> 14:10.348
- [speaking German]

14:10.350 --> 14:11.282
- What?
- Hey.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.884
- Okay, I guess the only
way to resolve this mess

14:12.886 --> 14:16.254
is for one of us to spend the
next few weeks learning German.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.823
Not it!
- Oh!

14:18.992 --> 14:21.726
- It's too late, Phoebe.
The Wolfgang's out of the cage.

14:21.728 --> 14:27.899
- [speaking German]

14:27.901 --> 14:30.835
- Wolfgang!
[speaking German]

14:30.837 --> 14:33.872
- You speak German then?

14:34.040 --> 14:36.040
- [speaking German]
Green Teens.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.910
[speaking German]

14:38.912 --> 14:40.245
Also, Bradford.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.145
- [laughing]

14:41.147 --> 14:44.349
Also, Bradford.
[laughing]

14:44.351 --> 14:45.283
- Bradford what?

14:45.285 --> 14:46.951
What did you say
about me?

14:46.953 --> 14:49.787
I will expel
everybody!

14:50.323 --> 14:53.858
- Hey, man, what did Phoebe
say about the Green Teens?

14:53.860 --> 14:56.027
- Wolfgang.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.096
- Oh, dude, she's right.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.331
The Marine Teens,
the Green Teens,

15:00.333 --> 15:01.766
and the Tambourine Teens

15:01.768 --> 15:04.035
should just share
the cafeteria.

15:04.037 --> 15:07.038
- CROWD:
[laughing, chattering]

15:07.040 --> 15:08.339
- PRINCIPAL BRADFORD:
[groaning]

15:08.341 --> 15:11.442
You take the fun out of
everything, Phoebe Thunderman.

15:11.444 --> 15:14.178
- And don't you
forget it!

15:14.180 --> 15:16.214
- Do you realize
what you just said?

15:16.216 --> 15:19.183
- Yes, and I immediately
regret it.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.920
- ¶

15:21.922 --> 15:23.354
- Party of two,
right this way.

15:23.356 --> 15:26.958
Uh, the special today
is the tube tartare.

15:27.961 --> 15:30.261
- Thank you and have
a splatacular day.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.964
- Here, Mrs. Wong,
let me take that for you.

15:32.966 --> 15:33.431
- Oh.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.067
- If you want a good review,
give this to the blogger,

15:36.069 --> 15:39.304
and for once in
your life, be nice.

15:40.473 --> 15:41.806
- Hi!

15:41.808 --> 15:43.474
I am nice.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.811
- Brava, Lady Wong.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.279
Your restaurant
is quite impressive.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.516
Expect a glowing review
and my phone number.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.451
- MRS. WONG:
Ohhhh...

15:54.120 --> 15:54.953
Ohhhh...

15:54.955 --> 15:57.355
- Well, we made every
possible save we could.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.357
- Yeah, it was
a good day's work--

15:59.359 --> 16:01.292
a day that is
about to end.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.062
- COLOSSO:
Yeeeee-ha!

16:04.064 --> 16:07.231
Happy National
Cowboy Day, cowpoke!

16:08.234 --> 16:09.534
- Ohhhhh...
[stamping feet]

16:09.536 --> 16:11.970
I really thought making
all those saves would work.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.105
Are we just gonna
relive this horrible day

16:14.107 --> 16:15.573
for the rest
of our lives?

16:15.575 --> 16:18.209
- Yeesh,
what a drama queen.

16:18.878 --> 16:21.245
- You know what?
I'm calling the Hero League.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.014
It's time to get help.
- No!

16:23.016 --> 16:26.117
- Max, give me my phone back.
Let me put an end to this.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.318
- I can't, Phoebe.
- Why not?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.954
- Because, I want us to
figure this out ourselves.

16:29.956 --> 16:32.423
We're superheroes.
We should be able to fix this.

16:32.425 --> 16:33.858
- But--
- No buts.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.160
Buts are for quitters
and sitters.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.396
- Okay, now you're
just being weird.

16:38.398 --> 16:41.265
But if this is what
you really want, then fine.

16:41.267 --> 16:41.833
- It is.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.836
Now go upstairs and have some
of dad's freakish pancake

16:44.838 --> 16:46.537
that he loves
more than us.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.973
I'll be up there
in a minute.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.177
Oh, it's
getting harder

16:53.179 --> 16:56.014
to keep you a secret,
repeat clock.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.150
- Repeat clock?

16:59.152 --> 17:00.418
It's not the Z Force

17:00.420 --> 17:02.620
making us live
this day over and over.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.322
It's you!

17:05.558 --> 17:08.926
- ¶ Drama-a-a-a! ¶

17:12.966 --> 17:14.098
- A repeat clock, Max?

17:14.100 --> 17:15.233
Why would you
invent something

17:15.235 --> 17:17.268
that makes us repeat the same
day over and over again?

17:17.270 --> 17:20.238
- Wait, how long have
I been in this cowboy outfit?

17:20.240 --> 17:22.540
- You shouldn't ask me.
You don't wanna know.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.143
- You couldn't use that thing
when I was dressed up

17:25.145 --> 17:27.311
for National
Ellen DeGeneres Day?

17:27.313 --> 17:30.848
- Okay, hello? We have
a bigger problem here.

17:30.850 --> 17:31.582
Max, explain yourself.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.918
- Yes, I have been
making us repeat today.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.319
But I have
a good reason.

17:35.321 --> 17:36.521
- Great.
Let's hear it.

17:36.523 --> 17:37.989
- It's kind
of a big deal.

17:37.991 --> 17:40.291
You might wanna
sit down for this.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.226
- Better be good.

17:45.131 --> 17:47.131
- Okay.
[sighs]

17:47.133 --> 17:49.033
Here goes.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.937
- Max, get back here!

17:52.939 --> 17:54.472
Max!

17:55.942 --> 17:58.609
- Max, you're
just in time...

17:59.479 --> 18:01.145
- HANK:
[gasps]

18:01.147 --> 18:02.013
Oh, no, my pancake!

18:02.015 --> 18:05.550
- My breakfast!
- My turn to yell something!

18:05.552 --> 18:09.020
- ¶

18:09.022 --> 18:09.787
- So, you Marine Teens,

18:09.789 --> 18:12.156
make like a rubber
tree and bounce.

18:12.158 --> 18:14.892
- Hey, everybody,
Phoebe's right behind me

18:14.894 --> 18:17.428
and she's giving
away $20 bills.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.298
- CROWD:
[mixed comments]

18:20.300 --> 18:21.432
- We want our $20.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.401
- What? I don't
have your $20.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.936
Where's Max?

18:24.938 --> 18:26.170
- Wolfgang.

18:26.172 --> 18:29.874
- [speaking German]

18:31.978 --> 18:33.578
- [gasping]
Wolfgang!

18:33.580 --> 18:36.114
- [speaking German]

18:36.116 --> 18:37.415
Also, Bradford.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.451
- [laughing]
Also, Bradford.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.486
- CROWD:
[laughing]

18:41.488 --> 18:43.588
- Put a schnitzel in it!

18:43.590 --> 18:46.224
- CROWD:
[laughing]

18:51.531 --> 18:54.932
- Ladies, are you
from Tennessee?

18:54.934 --> 18:57.335
'Cause you're
the only tens I see.

18:59.606 --> 19:02.974
I thought the 90th
time would be the charm.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.675
Hey!
[powers whooshing]

19:08.081 --> 19:10.081
- Oh, look, my two
favorite people.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.483
- MAX & PHOEBE:
Can it, Wong!

19:14.621 --> 19:16.320
- Give me that clock.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.489
- Oh, you wanna
fight, Max?

19:18.491 --> 19:20.224
I'll give you a fight.

19:20.226 --> 19:21.359
- [dramatic music]

19:21.361 --> 19:25.630
- MAX & PHOEBE:
[grunts of combat]

19:25.632 --> 19:31.969
- ¶

19:31.971 --> 19:33.938
- Give it up, Max!
It's over!

19:33.940 --> 19:35.973
- I'll never give up!
[grunts]

19:35.975 --> 19:36.974
- MRS. WONG:
[gasps]

19:36.976 --> 19:39.544
- [dishes & objects
clattering]

19:41.247 --> 19:42.713
- Time to go!

19:42.715 --> 19:46.384
- ¶

19:46.386 --> 19:48.386
- Hi, Max.
- [gasps]

19:48.388 --> 19:49.420
How'd you get
here before me?

19:49.422 --> 19:51.989
- While I was learning German
at the community college,

19:51.991 --> 19:54.659
I also got certified
in speed walking.

19:57.263 --> 19:59.297
It's over, Max.
[powers whooshing]

19:59.299 --> 20:00.031
- But...

20:00.033 --> 20:01.465
Phoebe, don't, please!

20:01.467 --> 20:02.133
- Why not?

20:02.135 --> 20:03.734
Why won't you let
tomorrow happen?

20:03.736 --> 20:05.970
I want the truth
this time.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.505
- Because...

20:07.507 --> 20:08.706
I'm scared. Okay?

20:08.708 --> 20:10.374
I'm not ready for
tomorrow to be here yet.

20:10.376 --> 20:13.110
What if we don't make it
to the Z Force Championships?

20:13.112 --> 20:15.179
- We'll figure it out.
[powers whooshing]

20:15.181 --> 20:16.347
- It's not that
easy for me.

20:16.349 --> 20:19.050
I've never worked this
hard at anything in my life,

20:19.052 --> 20:20.985
including being evil.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.320
If I fail, what then?

20:22.322 --> 20:24.355
- We're not gonna fail.
- You don't know that.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.657
- Max, look at everything
you've already done,

20:26.659 --> 20:29.327
and how much you've
already accomplished.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.428
You're...

20:30.430 --> 20:31.729
We're a great
team, okay?

20:31.731 --> 20:33.998
We can't let the fear
of getting bad news

20:34.000 --> 20:36.167
keep us from
moving forward.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.203
- I guess you're right.

20:39.205 --> 20:41.372
I am pretty great.

20:42.642 --> 20:45.042
Do what you
have to do.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.046
- [powers whooshing]

20:49.048 --> 20:52.283
[breathing fiery air]
- [clock sizzling]

20:54.487 --> 20:56.320
- What you doin'?

20:56.322 --> 20:57.421
- Oh, hi.
[laughs]

20:57.423 --> 20:59.457
Um, messing with
the time/space continuum,

20:59.459 --> 21:02.260
could have ended
the world, but, uh, hey...

21:02.262 --> 21:04.262
dodged that bullet.

21:06.399 --> 21:11.202
- ¶

21:11.204 --> 21:12.803
- COLOSSO:
Yeeeee-ha!

21:12.805 --> 21:16.207
Happy National
Cowboy Day, cowpoke!

21:16.209 --> 21:17.608
- What?

21:17.610 --> 21:18.643
- Just kidding.

21:18.645 --> 21:21.078
Happy Ellen DeGeneres Day!

21:22.048 --> 21:25.349
- Max! Max, it's
finally tomorrow!

21:25.351 --> 21:26.250
- It sure is.

21:26.252 --> 21:29.120
Which means it's time
to Ellen dance.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.388
- [lively dance music]

21:30.390 --> 21:32.623
- Yeah! Hello! Nya!

21:32.625 --> 21:33.824
- MAX & PHOEBE:
Stop it!

21:33.826 --> 21:35.259
- [music stops]
- Okay.

21:35.261 --> 21:37.295
Even I feel
uncomfortable.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.297
- Thanks for
yesterday, Phoebs.

21:39.299 --> 21:41.165
I mean, the last one.
- PHOEBE: [laughs]

21:41.167 --> 21:43.768
- I'm ready for whatever
the Z Force has to tell us.

21:43.770 --> 21:44.535
- Oh, yeah, the Z Force.

21:44.537 --> 21:47.104
Well, now I'm freaking out.
I mean, you were right.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.506
This is the biggest
day of our lives.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.508
Everything we've ever
done is riding on this.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.542
I can't be down here.

21:51.544 --> 21:52.510
What if
President Kickbutt calls?

21:52.512 --> 21:54.679
What if we missed her call?
We can't miss her call!

21:54.681 --> 21:58.716
All our hard work gone,
vanished...[speaking German]

21:59.719 --> 22:03.154
- Ugh! This already feels
like the longest day ever.

22:03.156 --> 22:07.091
- [laughs] Trust me,
I've had longer.

22:10.463 --> 22:25.476
