00:08.166 --> 00:11.499
This is the loveliest walk
we've taken that I can remember!

00:11.499 --> 00:13.000
Isn't it, Mickey?

00:13.000 --> 00:15.208
It's the only walk we've
taken that I can remember.

00:16.208 --> 00:18.208
Which makes it the loveliest.

00:25.915 --> 00:28.166
I guess I'm getting a little bit hungry.

00:28.166 --> 00:29.041
No problem, minnie!

00:33.166 --> 00:34.083
Just the way you like it!

00:34.083 --> 00:35.790
Extra mustard!

00:40.124 --> 00:41.874
Oh, I got it!

01:04.499 --> 01:06.416
Gotcha!

01:06.416 --> 01:07.790
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:52.624 --> 01:54.333
Hot dog!

02:00.957 --> 02:04.041
And what would you say this
purse snatcher looked like, ma'am?

02:04.041 --> 02:06.915
He was pink and delicious!

02:06.915 --> 02:09.249
And he went that-a-way!

02:09.249 --> 02:11.790
Ah, I fold.

02:11.790 --> 02:13.457
Too rich for my blood.

02:13.457 --> 02:15.166
Anyone else playin'?

02:18.083 --> 02:20.499
Looks like weenie's all in.

02:43.208 --> 02:44.790
Now where did he go?

02:51.624 --> 02:52.832
Oh!

02:54.457 --> 02:57.000
Your hot dog, my lady!

02:57.000 --> 03:00.083
Oh, Mickey!
You're the greatest!

03:03.374 --> 03:04.749
Oh.

03:04.749 --> 03:06.041
Hold it right there!

03:06.041 --> 03:08.083
Are you sure this is
the purse-snatcher, ma'am?

03:08.083 --> 03:09.333
Of course!

03:09.333 --> 03:12.208
I'd recognize that dirty dog anywhere!

03:12.208 --> 03:13.333
Oh, wait... no. I...

03:14.374 --> 03:16.499
This mouse is a hero!

03:17.624 --> 03:19.249
Free hot dogs all around!
