00:13.796 --> 00:17.321
- Okay, so basically you want
Bobbi to stay up for you?

00:17.365 --> 00:19.280
- She could at least try.

00:19.323 --> 00:20.672
- Just for a few
good night kisses.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.065
- Right.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.545
- And then go to sleep
super easy

00:23.588 --> 00:25.199
with no bouncing, white noise,
or tiptoeing required.

00:25.242 --> 00:27.114
- Very realistic plan.

00:27.157 --> 00:29.507
- I have been using
the five Ss by the way.

00:29.551 --> 00:31.553
Thank you for that.
- Yeah.

00:31.596 --> 00:32.815
- Really knocks Luna out.
Lifesaver.

00:34.295 --> 00:36.123
- The real lifesaver is
you can take Luna to work.

00:36.166 --> 00:38.429
Sadly, Bobbi's not into
the whole music scene.

00:38.473 --> 00:40.388
- Not what she told me.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.737
Is everything okay?

00:43.739 --> 00:47.090
Yeah, I got
impossible-to-get tickets

00:47.134 --> 00:49.049
for me and a friend to
see Carol Churchill's play.

00:49.092 --> 00:50.833
- Oh, I'm dying to see that.
- And my friend just bailed.

00:50.876 --> 00:52.791
- Oh.

00:54.402 --> 00:57.274
- You should come.
- Um, yeah--no, uh...

00:57.318 --> 00:58.710
- If you want, I mean.
No pressure.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.321
- No, I mean if you want.
I don't wanna...

01:00.364 --> 01:01.626
- If you don't,
that's cool.

01:01.670 --> 01:04.238
- I'm into it.
Yes.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.240
- Okay.
- Okay, so--

01:06.283 --> 01:09.069
- Great.
- Great.

01:09.112 --> 01:11.114
- Yeah.

01:19.383 --> 01:20.558
I'm sorry.

01:22.125 --> 01:24.214
Sorry!
Sorry, I'm late.

01:24.258 --> 01:26.695
I hate being the last one
here--uh, Sergeant Todd.

01:26.738 --> 01:27.783
- Sir.

01:27.826 --> 01:29.437
- Uh, are we very early
or very late?

01:29.480 --> 01:31.221
- There's no meeting,
Dr. Goodwin.

01:31.265 --> 01:32.353
- No meeting?

01:33.789 --> 01:35.443
Why do I suddenly get the
feeling I'm being ambushed?

01:35.486 --> 01:37.184
- No, no.
If this were an ambush

01:37.227 --> 01:39.186
I would've placed myself
against that wall,

01:39.229 --> 01:40.752
allowing the open door
to obscure me

01:40.796 --> 01:42.667
as you entered the room.

01:42.711 --> 01:45.148
I'm here to deliver a message
from the board

01:45.192 --> 01:46.410
that they were
too afraid to deliver.

01:46.454 --> 01:48.151
- Which is?

01:48.195 --> 01:49.457
- You have to cut $2 million
from the budget

01:49.500 --> 01:50.501
by the end of tomorrow.

01:52.112 --> 01:55.419
And may I send a specifically
worded message back with you?

01:55.463 --> 01:57.421
- As soon as we've picked
what goes.

01:58.901 --> 02:01.643
Now, it appears in your tenure
at New Amsterdam,

02:01.686 --> 02:04.472
you have created more than
200 very successful programs.

02:04.515 --> 02:05.690
- Thank you, Todd.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.431
- That have
absolutely no funding.

02:07.475 --> 02:08.867
Most never did.

02:08.911 --> 02:12.480
This one here, CF56Z,

02:12.523 --> 02:14.656
costs exactly 2 million.

02:14.699 --> 02:17.746
We could get this done
right now.

02:17.789 --> 02:22.751
- Great, CF56Z,
that would be...hmm.

02:22.794 --> 02:26.363
"Postnatal Care for
Undocumented Mothers."

02:26.407 --> 02:28.887
- That's unfortunate.
- It is, Todd.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.455
- I'm not here to argue

02:31.499 --> 02:33.153
which of these programs
deserves to stay.

02:33.196 --> 02:34.284
I'm here to make sure that

02:34.328 --> 02:35.633
2 million dollars'
worth of them goes.

02:35.677 --> 02:38.332
- And if I refuse?

02:38.375 --> 02:40.725
- Then New Amsterdam
will not make payroll.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.814
And tomorrow
every one of your employees

02:42.858 --> 02:45.469
will be sent home
without a dime.

02:54.348 --> 02:55.653
- Notice anything
different about me?

02:55.697 --> 02:57.264
And don't say my hair

02:57.307 --> 02:59.179
because I chopped it off last
year, and I will punch you.

02:59.222 --> 03:00.571
- Good morning.
- What?

03:00.615 --> 03:01.833
- Good morning.
That's what people say

03:01.877 --> 03:03.183
when they first interact
for in day.

03:03.226 --> 03:04.706
- Yeah, well, it was implied.
Hey now--

03:04.749 --> 03:06.534
- All I'm saying is that every
time I'm in the hallway

03:06.577 --> 03:08.666
people are jumping out at me
mid-conversation.

03:08.710 --> 03:09.841
It's rude.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.626
There is always time
for manners.

03:11.669 --> 03:13.323
- Outside of nuclear
submarines,

03:13.367 --> 03:14.672
this is literally the place

03:14.716 --> 03:16.283
with the least amount of time
for manners.

03:16.326 --> 03:17.806
Now, you know what?
I'm just gonna tell you.

03:17.849 --> 03:20.461
It's my leg.
I'm finally better.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.202
No more braces,
no more crutches...

03:35.911 --> 03:37.347
- Lauren.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.829
- Oh, we really need
to work on your manners.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.222
- Hey, we need help!

03:42.265 --> 03:43.571
- Yes, sir?
- Yes, please, please.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.442
Somebody help my wife!
- You don't have to shout.

03:45.486 --> 03:46.965
- Just please tell me
what happened.

03:47.009 --> 03:48.837
- She fell, hit her head--
- No, no.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.360
- She was unconscious.
- I bumped my head.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.275
It's not a big deal.
- Yes, it is a big deal!

03:52.319 --> 03:53.885
I just slipped for a second.
- This is serious.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.409
- Please, don't make
a drama out of it.

03:55.452 --> 03:56.975
- Hi, I'm Dr. Bloom.
- Hi.

03:57.019 --> 03:58.586
- We're gonna figure out just
how big a deal this is, okay?

03:58.629 --> 04:00.109
- I promise you,
it looks worse than it is.

04:00.152 --> 04:02.720
- Let's go to bay 27.
- I slipped on our way to Shul,

04:02.764 --> 04:04.853
in front everyone we know.
- Okay, Dr. Walsh!

04:04.896 --> 04:06.550
Please, can you come
stitch up a lac--

04:06.594 --> 04:07.986
And let's get, um...

04:08.030 --> 04:10.946
- Steph Goldman.
- Mrs. Goldman a CT scan.

04:10.989 --> 04:12.469
- But it's the Sabbath.

04:12.513 --> 04:13.905
No electricity.
- It's not a big deal.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.907
- If mom hit her head,
it could be dangerous.

04:15.951 --> 04:17.692
HaShem makes exceptions
to save a life.

04:17.735 --> 04:19.389
- Uh, if you could just go
with Casey,

04:19.433 --> 04:20.738
and I'm gonna bring
your mom right back, okay?

04:20.782 --> 04:22.044
- Mom.
Mom, wait.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.003
- Can I stay with her?

04:25.047 --> 04:27.005
- Ah...

04:27.049 --> 04:29.399
How did I get so lucky?

04:29.443 --> 04:31.401
Is it okay if she stays?

04:31.445 --> 04:32.750
- Uh, sure.
Yeah.

04:32.794 --> 04:35.362
- Thank you.
Come here, sweetheart.

04:35.405 --> 04:37.929
I am fine.
It looks worse than it is.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.757
Your mother's a klutz.

04:39.801 --> 04:41.585
- It's just a little blood.

04:41.629 --> 04:42.630
Right?

04:47.852 --> 04:50.638
- Oh, you must be
my new mentee, Dawn.

04:50.681 --> 04:51.769
- Uh--

04:51.813 --> 04:53.162
- Today must be
very exciting for you.

04:53.205 --> 04:55.860
I still remember my first day
working in a hospital.

04:55.904 --> 04:56.905
- Oh.

04:56.948 --> 04:58.385
Thank you, but I'm--
I'm actually--

04:58.428 --> 05:00.343
- Now, before you join me
on my rounds,

05:00.387 --> 05:02.519
I've compiled these books
you must read to give you

05:02.563 --> 05:05.914
a proper framework on Neurology
at New Amsterdam.

05:05.957 --> 05:08.438
- Dr. Kapoor.
I'm not Dawn.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.701
I'm Dr. Gibbs,
the lead programmer.

05:10.745 --> 05:12.486
- Programmer?

05:12.529 --> 05:14.662
- Yes.

05:14.705 --> 05:17.621
This is D.A.W.N.

05:17.665 --> 05:20.407
The Diagnostic Assessment
Wellness Network.

05:22.409 --> 05:23.975
I don't understand.

05:24.019 --> 05:28.110
You want me to mentor an iPad?
- Dawn is a prototype

05:28.153 --> 05:30.460
for what we hope will become
the most advanced

05:30.504 --> 05:33.463
Artificial Intelligence program
in medical diagnosing.

05:33.507 --> 05:35.117
- But, wh--I'm--
no, no, no, no--

05:35.160 --> 05:36.466
- You'll take D.A.W.N.
with you on rounds,

05:36.510 --> 05:37.685
so it can improve
its algorithms,

05:37.728 --> 05:39.556
and these textbooks,
I'll just upload them.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.862
- Upload?

05:40.905 --> 05:42.646
It took me years
to read those books.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.648
- Well, D.A.W.N.'s connected to
the hospital's medical network.

05:44.692 --> 05:47.042
So you'll have instant access
to patient files,

05:47.085 --> 05:50.045
radiology scans,
MRIs, lab data.

05:50.088 --> 05:54.702
With your help, D.A.W.N. will
become the future of medicine.

05:54.745 --> 05:57.835
- Nice to meet you,
Dr. Kay-poor.

05:57.879 --> 05:59.620
- Mm.

05:59.663 --> 06:00.838
- It's Kapoor!

06:02.449 --> 06:03.537
- I refuse.

06:03.580 --> 06:05.016
- Okay, Todd, here's the deal.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.061
Since we are not gonna

06:06.104 --> 06:07.541
cut anything major
from this budget,

06:07.584 --> 06:09.891
we're gonna make a lot of
small cuts to each department.

06:09.934 --> 06:12.763
- My commanding officer would
call that the Fabian Strategy.

06:12.807 --> 06:14.112
- That's the one.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.505
- You have no idea
what that is, do you?

06:15.549 --> 06:17.115
- No, I do not.
- Max, you got a sec?

06:17.159 --> 06:18.595
- Yeah.
- It's about my future.

06:18.639 --> 06:20.380
- Great, I wanna talk to you
about your future as well.

06:20.423 --> 06:21.424
- You do?
- Yeah.

06:21.468 --> 06:22.817
You have, uh, seven

06:22.860 --> 06:24.427
dual-chamber
pacemaker surgeries

06:24.471 --> 06:25.863
on the books for tomorrow?
- That's right.

06:25.907 --> 06:28.475
- Yeah, so those pacemakers
are made in Mexico,

06:28.518 --> 06:30.085
but the American inventors
charge three times as much,

06:30.128 --> 06:31.956
so we're gonna
cancel the order,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.872
place it directly with the
manufacturer in Mexico city.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.961
It's gonna save us 50,000,

06:37.005 --> 06:38.572
but it's gonna, uh, have
to push your surgeries.

06:38.615 --> 06:40.704
Why not save money on shipping

06:40.748 --> 06:42.750
and just have me do
the surgeries in Mexico?

06:44.186 --> 06:46.449
- No, that--
that was sarcasm.

06:46.493 --> 06:47.885
- That was genius.

06:47.929 --> 06:49.583
Mexico's opening tons
of new clinics

06:49.626 --> 06:51.454
in response to our
skyrocketing medical costs.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.543
We could pay for you and your
patients to fly to Mexico,

06:53.587 --> 06:55.719
it's gonna save them in
co-pays, and us, like, 50--

06:55.763 --> 06:57.895
$100,000.

06:57.939 --> 07:00.855
- So my patients are supposed
to just go to Mexico tomorrow?

07:00.898 --> 07:02.204
- Yeah.
Only if they're content with

07:02.247 --> 07:03.988
getting the same surgery,
with the same surgeon

07:04.032 --> 07:05.903
for less money
and a better view.

07:07.688 --> 07:08.993
100,000 down.
You happy?

07:09.037 --> 07:10.560
- Sure.

07:10.604 --> 07:13.041
Why wouldn't I be happy about
outsourcing American jobs?

07:13.084 --> 07:14.738
That also--
both: Sarcasm.

07:14.782 --> 07:15.957
- Yeah.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.567
- I don't know what Ralph
and Piggy thought

07:17.611 --> 07:19.917
when they found it,
I think both the conch shell

07:19.961 --> 07:22.877
and the boar's head symbolize
power, just different types.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.139
- Knock knock.

07:24.182 --> 07:26.924
I hate to interrupt
the creative process,

07:26.968 --> 07:28.883
but I have the results
of your biopsy.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.495
The mass in your stomach

07:32.539 --> 07:35.150
turned out to be a Primitive
Neuroectodermal Tumor.

07:35.977 --> 07:36.934
- Tumor?

07:36.978 --> 07:38.675
- The good news is,
it's benign.

07:38.719 --> 07:39.894
Surgeons should be able
to remove it,

07:39.937 --> 07:41.591
and Cephas will make
a full recovery.

07:41.635 --> 07:43.811
- What caused it?

07:45.769 --> 07:48.729
- Tumors are very sensitive
to hormone levels

07:48.772 --> 07:51.122
inside the body,
and in Cephas' case,

07:51.166 --> 07:52.863
he had an excessive amount
of cortisol,

07:52.907 --> 07:55.736
which is one of the body's
main stress hormones.

07:57.085 --> 07:59.957
How does a 13-year-old
get a tumor from stress?

08:00.001 --> 08:03.178
- That's what
I'd like to find out.

08:04.048 --> 08:05.876
- Dr. Sharpe didn't
say anything

08:05.920 --> 08:07.269
about the tumor
being in my brain.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.010
- No, no, no, no.
Um...

08:09.053 --> 08:10.490
that's a little misleading.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.883
Psych is not just about what's
going on in your head.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.145
Because what is going on
up there

08:14.189 --> 08:15.930
can affect
your entire body, right?

08:15.973 --> 08:19.499
In your case, excessive
cortisol levels caused a tumor,

08:19.542 --> 08:23.154
but cortisol is triggered by
PTSD, stress, anxiety--

08:23.198 --> 08:25.809
- But, I don't have
any of those things.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.115
PTSD?

08:27.158 --> 08:29.683
My life was pretty boring
until I came here.

08:29.726 --> 08:31.162
- Okay.

08:31.206 --> 08:32.816
Do you have any stressors
in your life?

08:32.860 --> 08:34.644
- I'm good.

08:34.688 --> 08:37.604
Home's good.
School's good.

08:37.647 --> 08:40.607
My biggest stressor
is the school librarian.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.913
- The librarian?
All right.

08:42.957 --> 08:44.741
What's happening there?
Tell me about that.

08:44.785 --> 08:47.265
- She refuses to let me
check out some books

08:47.309 --> 08:50.007
because they're reserved
for gifted students--

08:50.051 --> 08:52.096
even though I've been
reading them for years.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.576
That's it.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.883
- But that upset you.
- Yeah.

08:55.926 --> 08:58.276
But they're just books.
Who cares?

08:58.320 --> 09:01.105
- Well, yeah, but they're
not just books, are they?

09:01.149 --> 09:02.629
And I think that you care.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.631
I think you care
very much.

09:05.632 --> 09:06.981
Tell me why.

09:13.944 --> 09:16.338
- Because I'm smart too.

09:17.252 --> 09:19.210
- Yeah.

09:19.254 --> 09:21.778
Does anyone else in your life
make you feel that way?

09:21.822 --> 09:24.259
Less than?
Diminished?

09:24.302 --> 09:26.696
- I'm 13,

09:26.740 --> 09:29.917
so, like...everybody.

09:32.136 --> 09:33.834
- You know what?

09:33.877 --> 09:36.053
Let's, uh, let's try something
different here.

09:37.925 --> 09:40.362
Yes.

09:40.405 --> 09:43.626
All right, Cephas, I'm going
to read a few remarks,

09:43.670 --> 09:45.628
and you simply have to reply
one through ten.

09:45.672 --> 09:48.718
One meaning almost never,
ten meaning almost always.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.285
Okay?

09:50.328 --> 09:53.070
Piece of cake.
Here we go.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.725
What you think doesn't count
very much.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.205
- Ten.

09:57.248 --> 09:59.207
- Ten?
Really?

09:59.250 --> 10:02.079
- Yeah, ten.

10:02.123 --> 10:03.690
Ten it is.

10:03.733 --> 10:06.257
You feel excluded, isolated.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.650
- Ten.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.913
- The rich get richer
while the poor get poorer.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.741
- Absolutely ten.

10:11.785 --> 10:12.916
- When I walk into a store,

10:12.960 --> 10:14.614
I am followed
or closely watched.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.703
- Ten.
These questions are easy.

10:20.968 --> 10:23.144
- You feel threatened,
harassed,

10:23.187 --> 10:25.189
even if you can't
articulate why.

10:29.977 --> 10:31.369
- Ten.

10:34.024 --> 10:36.940
- Make yourself comfortable,
there's a couch over there.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.812
- Hey.
Is he okay?

10:38.855 --> 10:41.249
- Yeah, yeah, he's, um--
he's okay.

10:41.292 --> 10:43.860
I had Cephas answer some
questions from a Harvard test

10:43.904 --> 10:45.166
known as "Unrest."

10:45.209 --> 10:47.342
It is designed to, um,

10:47.385 --> 10:49.431
measure someone's level
of social resistance.

10:49.474 --> 10:50.824
- Social resistance?

10:50.867 --> 10:54.349
- When people like us oppose
the values and policies

10:54.392 --> 10:56.307
of the dominant culture.
- That's right.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.658
- And what does that
have to do with--

10:58.701 --> 11:01.225
- Your son, he feels threatened
on a daily basis.

11:01.269 --> 11:04.228
Like everything he's earned can
just be taken away.

11:04.272 --> 11:06.448
He's disenfranchised.

11:06.491 --> 11:09.146
But because his life is
seemingly free from all this,

11:09.190 --> 11:13.107
because he can't name it,
he's internalizing it.

11:13.150 --> 11:15.196
- Name what?

11:16.414 --> 11:18.329
- Racism.

11:18.373 --> 11:20.984
I think your son's tumor
was caused by racism.

11:38.262 --> 11:39.655
- Good to see you,
Mrs. Holland.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.135
- Dr. Reynolds, this place...

11:41.178 --> 11:43.703
no offence, but it's so much
nicer than New Amsterdam.

11:43.746 --> 11:46.531
- I'm glad you approve.
I'll see you in there.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.665
Wow, this is quite
the operation.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.449
We're pretty proud of it.

11:51.493 --> 11:53.582
For people who can't afford
American healthcare

11:53.625 --> 11:54.888
or a nice safe alternative.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.803
- And you only do
pacemakers here?

11:56.846 --> 11:59.370
- Focusing one procedure
makes us hyper efficient.

11:59.414 --> 12:00.763
- How efficient?

12:00.807 --> 12:03.244
- Well, we can usually
knock out about 11 a day.

12:03.287 --> 12:06.595
- Ah--that's pretty efficient.

12:06.638 --> 12:09.598
It may not be as fancy
as your cardio wing, but--

12:09.641 --> 12:12.340
- It definitely is.
It's nice!

12:12.383 --> 12:13.820
- How long have
you been Chair?

12:13.863 --> 12:17.867
- Uh, for about a year,
but I'm leaving.

12:17.911 --> 12:20.261
- Oh, I hear you.

12:20.304 --> 12:22.698
Public hospitals are what
sent me packing for Mexico.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.266
- Oh, I actually love
New Amsterdam.

12:25.309 --> 12:26.963
- Then why?

12:27.007 --> 12:29.792
- I love my fiancée more.

12:34.449 --> 12:35.667
- Max!

12:35.711 --> 12:37.887
Max, I need to talk to you.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.889
- Yeah, what's up?

12:39.933 --> 12:41.761
- She keeps coming back.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.850
- Should I be made aware
of any suspicious activity?

12:43.893 --> 12:45.199
- Just stand down, Todd.

12:45.242 --> 12:47.679
- She wants to teach a computer
to replace me.

12:47.723 --> 12:50.465
After all the personal
sacrifices I've made,

12:50.508 --> 12:52.510
just to have an iPad
steal my knowledge--

12:52.554 --> 12:54.077
it is not
"artificial" intelligence,

12:54.121 --> 12:55.992
it is my intelligence.

12:56.036 --> 12:57.689
- Max we're due in dermatology.
- I know.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.648
Vijay, since I have no idea
what you're talking about,

12:59.691 --> 13:01.476
I'm gonna trust you
to make the right decision.

13:01.519 --> 13:02.999
- Thank you.
I won't do it.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.958
No matter how much her company
is paying the hospital.

13:05.001 --> 13:06.350
- Come again?

13:06.394 --> 13:07.612
- How much are they
paying the hospital?

13:07.656 --> 13:09.832
- They are--
- $160,000.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.966
- Really?
That's, uh--Vijay,

13:13.009 --> 13:15.403
my friend, I think
that you and the iPad

13:15.446 --> 13:17.840
might've gotten off
on the wrong foot.

13:19.450 --> 13:22.976
- My body's been sore, and my
girl saw this crazy rash.

13:23.019 --> 13:26.544
- I have a couple of theories.
The first one I think--

13:26.588 --> 13:28.764
- Diagnosis confirmed.
Lyme disease.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.897
An email is being sent
to your account

13:30.940 --> 13:33.116
with detailed
treatment information.

13:38.382 --> 13:39.514
- Yes,
something to do with your--

13:43.997 --> 13:46.738
- I'm sorry,
but let me see--I--I...

13:54.877 --> 13:56.487
- What happens next?

13:56.531 --> 13:58.576
- We wait for the results
from your CT scan.

13:58.620 --> 14:01.014
Unfortunately, it can take
a couple hours to arrive

14:01.057 --> 14:02.450
from, uh, Radiology
because--

14:03.712 --> 14:05.366
- CT scan results
have arrived.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.847
- Diagnosis ACA aneurysm.
- What?

14:07.890 --> 14:09.413
- What? Where?
- What?

14:09.457 --> 14:10.980
- What, what?
- Aneurysm is located

14:11.024 --> 14:13.591
on the anterior clinoid
segment--

14:13.635 --> 14:16.464
- Nobody likes a show-off,
so just shut up, okay?

14:27.127 --> 14:29.912
- I-I have to go.
I need that back please.

14:29.956 --> 14:33.046
Okay.
You keep it.

14:33.089 --> 14:34.917
- Every day, 9:30-9:45--

14:34.961 --> 14:36.919
Sandra Fall from billing!
Hi.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.529
How goes it?

14:38.573 --> 14:40.053
- It doesn't go good because
you can't code for racism.

14:40.096 --> 14:43.883
- And yet, I did, so...

14:43.926 --> 14:45.928
- No, you hand-wrote
a non-option in the margin

14:45.972 --> 14:48.583
like a Bern Bro during
the 2016 General Election.

14:48.626 --> 14:50.585
- Yes, I did, because
there isn't a code

14:50.628 --> 14:51.760
for my actual diagnosis.

14:51.803 --> 14:52.848
- Okay, then change
your diagnosis

14:52.892 --> 14:54.154
to an approved ICD-10 code

14:54.197 --> 14:55.807
because that's how we bill
insurance companies.

14:55.851 --> 14:57.157
- No.
No, I'm sorry,

14:57.200 --> 14:58.680
I'm not gonna change
my diagnosis,

14:58.723 --> 15:00.421
Sandra Fall from billing--
not this time.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.162
Many, many times I've played it
fast and loose

15:02.205 --> 15:03.467
with insurance codes
to help patients.

15:03.511 --> 15:04.860
- Please, don't tell me that!
- Many times.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.818
But this time it will
actually hurt patients.

15:06.862 --> 15:09.038
Like, specifically
the 13-year-old boy

15:09.082 --> 15:11.780
who is lying in our OR
with a tumor.

15:11.823 --> 15:13.477
He's proof that racism

15:13.521 --> 15:14.783
can cause life-threatening
medical issues,

15:14.826 --> 15:16.132
and no one is doing
anything about it

15:16.176 --> 15:17.786
because no one is tracking
the data to prove it.

15:17.829 --> 15:20.049
And do you know why no one is
tracking the data to prove it?

15:20.093 --> 15:22.965
- Because the ICD-10 doesn't
have a diagnostic code for it?

15:23.009 --> 15:24.619
- Exactly.
- Dr. Frome,

15:24.662 --> 15:26.926
go ahead, change the world,

15:26.969 --> 15:29.624
but not until
you change the ICD codes.

15:30.233 --> 15:32.801
- That's--

15:32.844 --> 15:35.021
- Clamp.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.761
- Cephas' tumor's
nestled up against

15:36.805 --> 15:38.589
the inferior mesenteric.

15:38.633 --> 15:39.982
- I can definitely
get in there.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.941
Forceps.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.987
- NR BP 55.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.946
- Dr. Ayton,
look at this.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.730
Right next to the duodenum.

15:48.773 --> 15:51.080
- Another tumor.

15:51.124 --> 15:53.256
- Patient is hemodynamically
stable.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.825
- And looks like another two
right at the celiac junction.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.522
- Four total?

15:58.566 --> 16:00.220
- Surgery's gonna take
a bit longer.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.526
- I'll go tell his mother.

16:05.051 --> 16:08.141
- Helen, from what I can tell,

16:08.184 --> 16:10.665
these tumors are just going
to keep recurring.

16:10.708 --> 16:13.102
And next time they might not
be benign.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.540
- Stand by with
pylorus clamp.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.239
- Okay, give it to me straight,
Todd.

16:19.282 --> 16:21.197
- 100,000 from cardiothoracic--
- Yep.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.069
- 160k from neurology--
- Yep.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.635
- 45,000 from dermatology.

16:24.679 --> 16:25.897
- Come on, admit it.

16:25.941 --> 16:27.116
This skimming thing
is kind of working, right?

16:27.160 --> 16:28.509
- So long as everyone
does their part

16:28.552 --> 16:29.901
and sacrifices
for the greater good.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.729
- Exactly.
- Like Communism.

16:31.773 --> 16:33.035
- Max!
- Yeah?

16:33.079 --> 16:34.689
- Notice anything different
about me?

16:34.732 --> 16:36.299
- Actually,
I have been noticing

16:36.343 --> 16:38.693
a lot of your patients
are being admitted

16:38.736 --> 16:41.826
before they need to be.
Uh, ACS, pre-crisis diabetics--

16:41.870 --> 16:44.742
The thing is, if they don't
actually end up in crisis,

16:44.786 --> 16:46.092
then we can't bill for it.

16:46.135 --> 16:49.051
- It's my leg.
Um, finally better.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.793
No biggie.
- That's great.

16:51.836 --> 16:53.882
So, it would save this hospital
a lot of money

16:53.925 --> 16:56.189
if you could keep
these patients in the ED

16:56.232 --> 17:00.062
for observation until a crisis
diagnosis can be confirmed.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.064
- If you don't mind hiring
20 more nurses,

17:02.108 --> 17:03.805
a dozen more orderlies,

17:03.848 --> 17:05.198
and increasing
the number of residents,

17:05.241 --> 17:07.156
and adding, like,
30 beds, then sure.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.115
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

17:09.158 --> 17:10.725
This area is off limits!

17:10.768 --> 17:12.596
You can't just keep coming back
here like this!

17:12.640 --> 17:14.903
Who the hell
do you think you are?

17:14.946 --> 17:16.078
- Uh...

17:16.122 --> 17:17.471
- So ultimately,

17:17.514 --> 17:19.951
I don't think it's going to
save you any money.

17:21.649 --> 17:23.216
- She seems fun.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.740
- Yeah, I'll figure out
whatever, uh, that was,

17:25.783 --> 17:28.221
but right now
I need a new strategy.

17:28.264 --> 17:31.615
- We could always
revisit cutting CF56Z.

17:31.659 --> 17:34.096
- You mean "Postnatal Care
for Undocumented Mothers."

17:34.140 --> 17:37.795
- I mean to save this hospital.
From your own good intentions.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.885
- I need some help here!

17:40.929 --> 17:43.236
Grab me an orderly
and a non-rebreather mask!

17:43.279 --> 17:44.846
- Hey, what happened?

17:44.889 --> 17:46.239
- She just started walking
and collapsed.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.110
- Okay, well, let's get her
back on her feet.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.807
- I-I can't feel my legs.

17:49.851 --> 17:50.852
- Where?
What part?

17:50.895 --> 17:52.158
- All over.
Everywhere.

17:52.201 --> 17:54.160
- What do her CTs say?
- Nothing.

17:54.203 --> 17:55.335
They were all clear.

17:55.378 --> 17:56.945
- Do we need a collar?
- Please, I--

17:56.988 --> 17:59.121
I can't--I can't feel my legs.
- Mom?

17:59.165 --> 18:01.036
Are you okay?
- I can't feel my legs.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.342
- What's going on?

18:02.385 --> 18:04.126
Please!
- She didn't hit her head.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.649
She just fell down.

18:18.053 --> 18:19.837
- Sir.
- Sir.

18:19.881 --> 18:22.144
- Hi there.
- Ma'am.

18:22.188 --> 18:25.060
- Um, thank you for agreeing
to meet us here.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.106
- We thought neutral territory
would be best

18:27.149 --> 18:28.411
for what Dr. Goodwin
has to say.

18:28.455 --> 18:29.717
- Yeah.
- Max, I think

18:29.760 --> 18:31.458
I can save New Amsterdam
and the city of New York

18:31.501 --> 18:32.720
hundreds of millions
of dollars.

18:32.763 --> 18:34.983
- Oh, then you should
definitely go first.

18:35.026 --> 18:36.898
- There's a 13-year-old boy
in surgery right now

18:36.941 --> 18:39.161
having multiple tumors removed
caused by racism.

18:39.205 --> 18:42.164
I know--I know how that sounds,
trust me, I do,

18:42.208 --> 18:44.384
but yesterday, I treated
two patients with PTSD

18:44.427 --> 18:45.907
from the exact same thing.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.430
Our ED,
at least three times a week,

18:47.474 --> 18:48.910
treats victims of hate crimes.

18:48.953 --> 18:51.739
The city is spending hundreds
of millions of dollars

18:51.782 --> 18:53.784
managing medical repercussions
of racism,

18:53.828 --> 18:55.090
and it doesn't even know it

18:55.134 --> 18:57.397
because the ICD-10
does not have a code for it.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.050
- This is not
gonna save us money.

18:59.094 --> 19:00.182
- How can I help?

19:00.226 --> 19:01.749
- A campaign
to make the ICD-10

19:01.792 --> 19:03.185
add racism
to their diagnostic index.

19:03.229 --> 19:04.926
All I need
is a little bit of money

19:04.969 --> 19:06.797
for a small team of
researchers and lobbyists--

19:06.841 --> 19:08.103
No.

19:10.453 --> 19:11.889
- What?
Say that again?

19:11.933 --> 19:13.369
- No.

19:13.413 --> 19:16.329
- That's--I've never heard you
say that word before.

19:16.372 --> 19:18.069
- In order to balance
the budget,

19:18.113 --> 19:20.246
Max has no choice
but to cut personnel.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.335
- How awful.

19:22.378 --> 19:25.076
- Did you guys have
anyone in mind?

19:34.347 --> 19:36.392
- Back away slowly.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.266
Go, go, slower.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.138
Okay, break.
Break--break for it.

19:47.534 --> 19:49.797
- Four tumors,
all being removed--

19:49.840 --> 19:52.234
it's just going to take
a little bit more time.

19:52.278 --> 19:55.063
- Why is this happening
to my son?

19:56.978 --> 19:58.806
- Uh...

19:58.849 --> 20:04.464
Cephas let me read his essay
on "Lord of the Flies,

20:04.507 --> 20:08.294
and it's clear
just how open he is.

20:08.337 --> 20:10.774
to the world.

20:10.818 --> 20:14.213
And while that openness lets in
a lot of beauty,

20:14.256 --> 20:17.085
it also lets in darker things.

20:20.306 --> 20:24.440
- God, I really thought
that I shielded him from...

20:24.484 --> 20:26.877
everything that
I have to deal with.

20:29.184 --> 20:32.796
I jumped through hoops to get
him into a progressive school

20:32.840 --> 20:34.972
with a uniform policy.

20:35.016 --> 20:37.888
I got him into group sports
with diverse coaches.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.499
His friends are amazing.
I--

20:42.589 --> 20:45.940
I thought I was doing
a good job, I really--

20:45.983 --> 20:48.899
- You--you are doing more
than a good job.

20:48.943 --> 20:51.989
That boy is extraordinary

20:52.033 --> 20:53.513
because of you.

20:57.517 --> 21:01.999
Even here,
in this progressive hospital,

21:02.043 --> 21:04.480
I deal with microaggressions
every day.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.613
From people who mean well.

21:06.656 --> 21:08.876
From people
who should know better.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.358
That's the world
that we live in.

21:13.489 --> 21:16.405
- So, then what can I do

21:16.449 --> 21:19.495
to keep my son from ending up
here next year?

21:21.192 --> 21:23.238
Next month?

21:27.547 --> 21:29.853
- Have you been out of country
recently?

21:29.897 --> 21:31.159
- No.

21:31.202 --> 21:34.293
- Been bitten by an animal
or a rodent?

21:34.336 --> 21:36.512
- Uh, just the occasional
mosquito bite.

21:36.556 --> 21:38.514
- Started any new diets?

21:38.558 --> 21:40.516
- We keep kosher.
Nothing trendy.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.563
- Swam in any natural
bodies of water?

21:44.564 --> 21:46.130
- No.

21:48.394 --> 21:52.223
Do you have any idea
what's happening to me?

21:52.267 --> 21:54.225
- Will you excuse us
for a second?

21:54.269 --> 21:55.966
Okay.

21:59.622 --> 22:01.537
Any theories?

22:01.581 --> 22:03.670
- Guillain-Barre syndrome
and Zika

22:03.713 --> 22:05.672
are both known
to cause leg paralysis,

22:05.715 --> 22:07.413
but her tests
came back normal.

22:07.456 --> 22:09.371
- And her CT came back negative

22:09.415 --> 22:11.068
except for some swelling
around the spine.

22:11.112 --> 22:13.941
- The only viable option right
now is to treat her symptoms,

22:13.984 --> 22:16.987
push steroids to reduce
her spinal swelling,

22:17.031 --> 22:20.556
unless D.A.W.N. has a different
diagnosis to humiliate me.

22:20.600 --> 22:21.688
D.A.W.N.-ji?

22:27.302 --> 22:28.434
This is bad.

22:32.742 --> 22:35.266
This is my favorite achievement
since coming here.

22:35.310 --> 22:37.399
Free daycare for all employees.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.575
- I don't see how getting rid
of a few daycare employees

22:39.619 --> 22:41.447
is gonna put a dent
in the budget.

22:41.490 --> 22:44.101
- Well, we contract out
the daycare service.

22:44.145 --> 22:45.668
It's a luxury,
I mean, it's not essential,

22:45.712 --> 22:49.106
and if we close it,
we might break even.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.108
- You're closing the daycare?

22:51.152 --> 22:53.023
- Now, Mariana,
I wouldn't even consider this

22:53.067 --> 22:56.200
unless I absolutely had to.
I mean, I need the daycare too.

22:56.244 --> 22:58.246
- So do a lot of the nurses
and residents.

22:58.289 --> 23:00.422
- I hear you, but--
- I don't think you do.

23:00.466 --> 23:03.947
- Do you know how expensive
regular daycare is?

23:03.991 --> 23:05.558
Not to mention,
they're only open ten hours,

23:05.601 --> 23:07.560
and most of us work
12-hour shifts.

23:07.603 --> 23:09.736
Are you gonna cut our hours
and pay us more too?

23:09.779 --> 23:12.434
- I need to cut costs
just to make payroll.

23:12.478 --> 23:15.132
- Well,
you can keep my paycheck

23:15.176 --> 23:16.656
because if we have to pay
for daycare,

23:16.699 --> 23:18.397
a lot of us will need new jobs.

23:25.795 --> 23:28.972
- We're not gonna cut
daycare, are we?

23:33.499 --> 23:35.152
- At the aortic arch.

23:35.196 --> 23:36.763
- Anterior wall
of the left atrium

23:36.806 --> 23:38.591
looks prime for placement
of the first lead.

23:38.634 --> 23:40.288
- All right, advancing now.

23:42.377 --> 23:44.161
- Just as good
as at New Amsterdam?

23:44.205 --> 23:46.381
I'm not gonna lie to you,

23:46.425 --> 23:48.470
I'm pretty proud
of what we accomplished.

23:48.514 --> 23:51.168
I mean, that's what makes
leaving so hard, you know?

23:53.388 --> 23:55.651
Whoa.
Is that from a lung?

23:55.695 --> 23:58.349
Did I hit something?
- No, it's from her stomach.

23:58.393 --> 24:00.351
Massive hematemesis.

24:00.395 --> 24:02.658
- Maybe it's a bleeding ulcer
or a Mallory Weiss Tear.

24:02.702 --> 24:05.095
- It looks like
variceal bleeding.

24:05.139 --> 24:07.315
- Her cirrhotic liver
decompensated.

24:07.358 --> 24:08.490
The blood is backing up
behind it.

24:08.534 --> 24:09.665
We need to make a new pathway

24:09.709 --> 24:11.362
so the blood
can bypass the liver.

24:11.406 --> 24:12.755
- Heart rate's up to 130.

24:12.799 --> 24:14.801
- All right, transfuse 2
units of packed red cells.

24:14.844 --> 24:17.586
- We don't have a blood bank.
We're not a hospital.

24:17.630 --> 24:18.718
I'm calling an ambulance.

24:18.761 --> 24:20.067
- Her blood pressure's
dropping.

24:20.110 --> 24:21.503
We don't have time.
We're working on her now.

24:21.547 --> 24:22.722
- I told you,

24:22.765 --> 24:24.201
we're only equipped
for cardiac emergencies.

24:24.245 --> 24:27.683
- Then we have to treat
Grace's liver like a heart.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.171
- She's never there anymore.

24:37.214 --> 24:38.477
She's only about her trial
these days.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.565
- Uh, can I run
something by you?

24:39.608 --> 24:41.001
- Sure,
but where's your bodyguard?

24:41.044 --> 24:42.437
- Oh, I gave him the slip.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.569
- Really?
- No, that's impossible.

24:43.612 --> 24:44.744
He's at lunch.

24:44.787 --> 24:46.223
- I'm having a bit
of a budget crisis,

24:46.267 --> 24:49.400
and I finally figured out
a way to, uh, close the gap.

24:49.444 --> 24:51.098
You ready?
- As ready as I'll ever be.

24:51.141 --> 24:54.405
- Okay, I want to eliminate
all over-testing.

24:54.449 --> 24:56.538
- That's a great idea.
- Really?

24:56.582 --> 24:58.061
- Oh, my God,

24:58.105 --> 24:59.933
you're the first person who has
not wanted to strangle me,

24:59.976 --> 25:02.065
or you know,
slam the door in my face.

25:02.109 --> 25:03.632
What test did you have in mind?

25:03.676 --> 25:06.505
- I wanna cut
yearly mammograms.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.071
- Sorry?
- I know how that sounds,

25:08.115 --> 25:09.769
okay, but
the US Preventative Task Force

25:09.812 --> 25:11.640
says they're unnecessary
for women under 50

25:11.684 --> 25:13.642
unless of course they fall
into a high-risk group.

25:13.686 --> 25:16.689
- Yeah, the American Cancer
Society says 45.

25:16.732 --> 25:19.082
A woman's individual doctor
might say 40.

25:19.126 --> 25:21.389
These tests aren't one-size
fits all.

25:21.432 --> 25:22.564
- I'm not saying they are.

25:22.608 --> 25:23.652
All I am saying
is women under 50

25:23.696 --> 25:25.045
are more likely
to get false positive

25:25.088 --> 25:26.612
and therefore
be over-diagnosed

25:26.655 --> 25:27.917
and over-treated
for something

25:27.961 --> 25:29.484
that may ultimately be
benign.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.399
- Someone may want
that peace of mind.

25:31.442 --> 25:33.793
- Well, but should New
Amsterdam be paying for it?

25:33.836 --> 25:36.447
- Fine, cut yearly mammograms.
- Really?

25:36.491 --> 25:37.840
- Sure.
- Thank you.

25:37.884 --> 25:39.407
- Except those mammograms

25:39.450 --> 25:41.496
are actually money-makers
for this hospital.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.672
- I walked right into this,
didn't I?

25:43.716 --> 25:45.500
- If you cut mammograms paid
for by insurance,

25:45.544 --> 25:46.936
I'm fairly certain

25:46.980 --> 25:48.459
it's gonna make your budget
shortfall even worse.

25:48.503 --> 25:50.374
- What about mammograms not
covered by insurance?

25:50.418 --> 25:52.551
- So you're suggesting
two standards of care,

25:52.594 --> 25:54.465
one for women with insurance
and one for women without?

25:54.509 --> 25:56.859
- No, because that would be--

25:56.903 --> 25:58.382
- Draconian.
- Yeah.

25:58.426 --> 26:00.820
And I would be ashamed to even
be having this conversation.

26:00.863 --> 26:02.299
- Don't be,

26:02.343 --> 26:04.084
because I'm sure Castro
will cut whatever you want.

26:06.042 --> 26:07.391
- Mm.

26:12.745 --> 26:14.703
- Glad I was at lunch
for that one.

26:18.751 --> 26:20.622
- These cardiac stents
are too small.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.581
They're made to open
a tiny artery,

26:22.624 --> 26:24.583
not make a large conduit
for bypassing the liver.

26:24.626 --> 26:27.150
- If I can just get
this last stent in place,

26:27.194 --> 26:29.805
the portal vein and the
hepatic vein will flow as one.

26:29.849 --> 26:31.938
- Switch ultrasound
to Doppler mode.

26:31.981 --> 26:34.418
- I don't see anything.
There's no flow.

26:34.462 --> 26:36.159
- You missed the connection.
We must have gone too distal.

26:36.203 --> 26:38.422
- BP's dropping again.

26:38.466 --> 26:40.468
- Hang a bag of Dobutamine.
Titrate to 3 micrograms.

26:40.511 --> 26:41.904
- I'm gonna try
to pass the wire.

26:41.948 --> 26:44.037
See if you can grab it,
all right?

26:44.080 --> 26:46.605
That'll help us
make the connection.

26:46.648 --> 26:48.563
Little further.

26:50.521 --> 26:51.653
A little further.

26:53.481 --> 26:54.917
Now.
- Got it.

26:54.961 --> 26:56.571
- Muy bien.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.007
- Looks like flow.

26:58.051 --> 27:00.880
I can't believe it.

27:01.663 --> 27:02.882
- Gauze.

27:02.925 --> 27:05.711
- Forgot how much
I missed real medicine.

27:25.556 --> 27:27.689
- My baby.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.691
- Okay, but the W.H.O.
needs a sponsor,

27:29.735 --> 27:32.694
and I can't--I can't get
a sponsor until the W.H.O.--

27:32.738 --> 27:34.740
Right exactly.

27:34.783 --> 27:35.958
Yes.
- Iggy!

27:36.002 --> 27:38.482
- Yes, I'll be there.
Thank you very much.

27:38.526 --> 27:40.659
- Iggy, where have you been?

27:40.702 --> 27:43.009
- Every day patients come in
with so many stressors

27:43.052 --> 27:45.141
that I have no idea
what the problem is.

27:45.185 --> 27:47.666
With Cephas, I know exactly
what the problem is,

27:47.709 --> 27:48.841
but I can't to do
anything about it,

27:48.884 --> 27:51.495
which is just crazy-maker,
you know?

27:51.539 --> 27:53.149
So I just managed
to get a meeting

27:53.193 --> 27:54.803
with a member the World Health
Organization so I can lobby--

27:54.847 --> 27:56.979
- Okay, Iggy, I love you,

27:57.023 --> 27:58.807
and I mean this
in the best possible way--

27:58.851 --> 28:00.026
- Uh-oh.

28:00.069 --> 28:02.681
- Forget about trying
to save the world

28:02.724 --> 28:05.771
and focus on trying
to save our patient,

28:05.814 --> 28:08.164
'cause no one else is going to.

28:17.870 --> 28:21.177
- Help.
Help, please, help.

28:21.221 --> 28:22.918
- Okay, deep breaths for me,
Steph, okay?

28:22.962 --> 28:25.834
Deep breaths.
- Now I can't move my arms.

28:25.878 --> 28:29.708
- Okay, let's get her on 100%
non-rebreather and a stat EKG.

28:29.751 --> 28:32.014
- Squeeze my hands.
Come on, as hard as you can.

28:32.058 --> 28:33.668
- I can't.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.756
- Steph!

28:36.149 --> 28:37.759
- Okay, let's get her
on 2 milligrams of Ativan.

28:37.803 --> 28:38.934
2 milligrams of Ativan!

28:38.978 --> 28:40.588
Oh, Mommy...

28:40.631 --> 28:42.764
- I need that Ativan!

28:42.808 --> 28:46.725
- Mommy, please stop.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.773
- Ascending paralysis.

28:51.817 --> 28:54.080
Soon she won't be able
to breathe.

28:54.123 --> 28:56.212
- It could be
Neuro-Bechet's Disease.

28:56.256 --> 29:00.216
- Diagnostic accuracy
below 1%.

29:00.260 --> 29:02.697
- A tumor can cause
paraneoplastic syndrome.

29:02.741 --> 29:06.266
- Diagnostic accuracy
less than 1%.

29:06.309 --> 29:08.224
- D.A.W.N. if you do not
have any actual ideas,

29:08.268 --> 29:09.225
please shut up.

29:09.269 --> 29:11.097
- Advise patient be placed

29:11.140 --> 29:13.055
in phenobarbital coma

29:13.099 --> 29:15.318
until diagnosis
can be reached.

29:15.362 --> 29:18.278
- Tell me we're not
doing that.

29:18.321 --> 29:20.889
- If we do not reach
diagnosis today...

29:22.238 --> 29:23.892
We'll have to.

29:29.158 --> 29:31.770
I really thought
we could do it.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.902
- We knew this
would be painful.

29:33.946 --> 29:35.643
Why do you think
Brantley sent me?

29:35.686 --> 29:37.166
- I could chip away at it,

29:37.210 --> 29:40.300
but every cut
just makes this hospital worse.

29:40.343 --> 29:42.258
- Which is why
I still think you should pick

29:42.302 --> 29:45.087
one big ticket item.

29:45.131 --> 29:46.697
Will it make
the hospital worse?

29:46.741 --> 29:48.308
Unfortunately, yes.

29:48.351 --> 29:50.919
But will it compromise every
single one of your departments?

29:50.963 --> 29:52.138
No.

29:52.181 --> 29:54.662
- Yeah.

29:54.705 --> 29:56.795
You know,
we were the first hospital

29:56.838 --> 29:58.753
in the country
to cover postnatal care

29:58.797 --> 30:00.929
for undocumented mothers.

30:05.455 --> 30:09.024
We were trying
to be pioneers.

30:16.423 --> 30:19.382
Now I can make payroll.

30:28.174 --> 30:31.003
- Max.

30:31.046 --> 30:33.440
You did the right thing.

31:03.731 --> 31:05.733
- Well, it looks like
Klinger's missed

31:05.776 --> 31:07.909
11 games this year,
and he's been battling

31:07.953 --> 31:09.650
this injury all season.

31:09.693 --> 31:11.173
- Oh, missed the second
free throw.

31:11.217 --> 31:13.132
Miller with the rebound.
- Are we winning?

31:13.175 --> 31:16.048
- He's got seven assists...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

31:16.091 --> 31:18.006
Please, please,
don't tell my dad.

31:18.050 --> 31:20.966
- Ah, the Sabbath.
No electricity.

31:21.009 --> 31:23.882
- It's just a really big game.

31:23.925 --> 31:26.580
- Your secret is safe
with me.

31:26.623 --> 31:28.582
Nets fans have suffered
enough.

31:30.671 --> 31:32.716
- May I?

31:35.806 --> 31:38.897
You must miss many games
because of the Sabbath.

31:38.940 --> 31:41.900
- Well, I kind of make
an exception for the Nets.

31:41.943 --> 31:44.337
We haven't won a championship
game in my whole life,

31:44.380 --> 31:47.035
but we're doing
really well this year.

31:47.079 --> 31:48.863
- Hm.
- Mm-hmm.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.997
- So do you break
any other Sabbath rules?

31:52.040 --> 31:54.086
- No way.
Never.

31:57.089 --> 31:59.700
- Shirley...

31:59.743 --> 32:04.052
this is question is a matter
of life and death.

32:04.096 --> 32:08.056
I believe you have
kept the Sabbath, but...

32:08.100 --> 32:11.059
have you kept kosher?

32:15.194 --> 32:16.673
- Vijay, you paged?

32:16.717 --> 32:20.199
- Hot dog!
- What are we talking about?

32:20.242 --> 32:23.724
- Shirley secretly ate
a street vendor's hot dog.

32:23.767 --> 32:26.074
- Shirley got a tapeworm?

32:26.118 --> 32:27.815
- And passed
its eggs unknowingly

32:27.858 --> 32:30.252
to her mother with a kiss.

32:30.296 --> 32:33.168
- Neurocysticercosis.

32:33.212 --> 32:34.387
Did D.A.W.N. confirm?

32:34.430 --> 32:36.215
- I turned D.A.W.N. off.

32:36.258 --> 32:39.261
Two tablets each,
and they will be cleared up.

32:39.305 --> 32:40.654
- I...

32:40.697 --> 32:42.830
I don't understand.

32:42.873 --> 32:45.093
Did I hurt my mom?

32:45.137 --> 32:49.619
- No, Shirley.
You saved her life.

32:55.321 --> 32:57.105
- Hey, there, kiddo.
How you doing?

32:57.149 --> 32:59.281
- Better.

32:59.325 --> 33:02.981
- Better is good.
Very good.

33:04.156 --> 33:07.289
So listen, I have...

33:07.333 --> 33:10.640
I have one question that was
not on my list from earlier.

33:10.684 --> 33:13.426
You feel up to answering it?

33:13.469 --> 33:20.128
Why wouldn't the librarian
let you take out those books?

33:20.172 --> 33:21.434
- I don't know.

33:21.477 --> 33:24.045
- Well, I think you do know.

33:24.089 --> 33:26.047
I think you know it so well

33:26.091 --> 33:27.657
that it is
eating you up inside,

33:27.701 --> 33:30.704
and it is causing you
to be sick.

33:32.445 --> 33:36.405
Why wouldn't the librarian
let you take out those books?

33:40.844 --> 33:43.847
- Because of the color
of my skin.

33:43.891 --> 33:45.414
But she's not racist.

33:45.458 --> 33:47.155
- Yeah, I don't doubt that
for a second.

33:47.199 --> 33:50.419
But, you know,
racism is so deeply ingrained

33:50.463 --> 33:53.118
in our society that people,
myself included,

33:53.161 --> 33:56.904
we often don't realize
that we're perpetuating it.

33:56.947 --> 33:59.211
- So, like...

33:59.254 --> 34:01.082
when people give me
nicknames I don't want

34:01.126 --> 34:02.301
'cause my name is different?

34:02.344 --> 34:04.694
- Yes,
that is a microaggression

34:04.738 --> 34:08.176
because of the color
of your skin.

34:08.220 --> 34:11.136
- What about when adults tell
me I speak really good English?

34:11.179 --> 34:14.095
- It's because of the color
of your skin.

34:14.139 --> 34:15.705
- Or when people assume

34:15.749 --> 34:18.882
I only got into my school
'cause I'm diverse?

34:18.926 --> 34:21.233
- Yes.

34:21.276 --> 34:23.017
- When the teacher tells me
to lower my voice,

34:23.061 --> 34:26.020
even though I'm not
the only one talking?

34:26.064 --> 34:28.196
Or she makes me answer
all the Latino questions

34:28.240 --> 34:29.502
'cause I'm the only one
in the room?

34:29.545 --> 34:32.113
- Yes.

34:35.116 --> 34:37.901
- I just thought...

34:37.945 --> 34:40.991
I didn't deserve to be there.

34:41.035 --> 34:43.081
I wasn't good enough.
I was a mistake.

34:43.124 --> 34:46.867
- No, Cephas, listen to me.

34:46.910 --> 34:49.261
All of this,
everything you're talking about

34:49.304 --> 34:51.001
has nothing to do with you,

34:51.045 --> 34:53.787
and everything to do
with the world around you.

34:53.830 --> 34:57.269
You walking around with all
of this shame and confusion

34:57.312 --> 34:58.922
and stress inside your body,

34:58.966 --> 35:01.925
I can see that you don't
want to feel this right now.

35:01.969 --> 35:04.189
But I'm telling you, your body
is definitely feeling it,

35:04.232 --> 35:07.279
and that is what
is making you sick.

35:09.063 --> 35:11.109
- So...

35:13.198 --> 35:15.504
How are you
gonna fix the world?

35:15.548 --> 35:17.289
- I'm not.

35:17.332 --> 35:20.335
I can't.

35:20.379 --> 35:24.774
But I can help you process.

35:24.818 --> 35:27.951
Because if we can name it,

35:27.995 --> 35:29.562
we can treat it.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.283
- You win.

35:55.327 --> 35:58.417
What do you want, Mom?

36:03.030 --> 36:06.207
- Dinner.

36:31.014 --> 36:33.843
- May, how long
has Fatima been like this?

36:33.887 --> 36:36.019
- All day.
- You should've paged me.

36:36.063 --> 36:39.197
- She's listed
as Castro's patient.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.634
- Fatima, sweetheart,
can I help you get back?

36:41.677 --> 36:43.288
- I'm fine.
Fine, fine, fine.

36:43.331 --> 36:46.247
- Okay.
Have you seen Dr. Castro?

36:46.291 --> 36:48.380
- Dr. Castro said
my numbers are good.

36:48.423 --> 36:50.208
I'm good.
Better than good.

36:50.251 --> 36:52.558
She said her trial's helping.

37:06.615 --> 37:07.573
- Yeah.

37:07.616 --> 37:09.531
- Max, I got some bad news.

37:09.575 --> 37:12.317
- I'm already there,
so just hit me.

37:12.360 --> 37:15.276
- Mexico is not the answer
to your budget crisis.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.930
You know, we shouldn't be
sending our patients

37:16.973 --> 37:19.672
2,000 miles away.
It erodes our hospital.

37:19.715 --> 37:22.588
And American hospitals
are eroded enough.

37:22.631 --> 37:25.112
And, Max, the other thing
I gotta tell you,

37:25.155 --> 37:26.548
it can't wait anymore,
all right?

37:26.592 --> 37:28.246
- Floyd, you're the best.
I gotta go.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.296
Hey, wait!

37:37.211 --> 37:38.299
Excuse me.

37:38.343 --> 37:40.910
Todd.
Wait, buddy, hold up.

37:40.954 --> 37:42.434
Hey.

37:42.477 --> 37:45.132
Listen,
I found a way to make payroll,

37:45.175 --> 37:48.309
save $2 million,
and not cut a single program.

37:48.353 --> 37:49.397
- How?

37:49.441 --> 37:51.312
- Add a program.

37:51.356 --> 37:53.445
- Todd, there are two ways
to meet the budget, right?

37:53.488 --> 37:54.533
We were trying to cut costs,

37:54.576 --> 37:57.144
but what if we tried
to add revenue?

37:57.187 --> 37:58.624
Okay, what we need
isn't less programs,

37:58.667 --> 38:00.147
it's more patients.

38:00.190 --> 38:02.323
- I think you've got all
the sick people you can handle.

38:02.367 --> 38:03.716
- Exactly.

38:03.759 --> 38:06.588
And so does
every other hospital.

38:06.632 --> 38:09.243
New Amsterdam has every
specialist under the sun.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.940
Right? But other hospitals
can't even afford

38:10.984 --> 38:13.116
to keep one specialist
on staff full time.

38:13.160 --> 38:16.598
America is full of people
who have specific medical needs

38:16.642 --> 38:18.383
that their local hospitals
can't meet,

38:18.426 --> 38:20.036
but we can.

38:20.080 --> 38:22.604
So instead of outsourcing
our patients,

38:22.648 --> 38:25.215
we're gonna outsource
our doctors.

38:25.259 --> 38:27.174
Okay, yeah, I'm gonna call it
something better,

38:27.217 --> 38:28.697
but I have commitments already

38:28.741 --> 38:31.004
from Bridgeport Medical
in Alabama,

38:31.047 --> 38:32.527
Mount Ida Memorial in Arkansas,

38:32.571 --> 38:34.312
Townsend Hospital Center
in Delaware.

38:34.355 --> 38:37.315
Look, we can fill America's
healthcare gaps,

38:37.358 --> 38:40.143
we can get fairly compensated,
and most importantly,

38:40.187 --> 38:42.276
we can...

38:42.320 --> 38:44.539
we can balance the budget.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.367
- What?

38:46.411 --> 38:49.327
Am I too late?
The budget's already in?

38:49.370 --> 38:50.589
- I threw it away.

38:50.632 --> 38:52.504
- You what?
- Your budget.

38:52.547 --> 38:53.505
Threw it away.

38:53.548 --> 38:56.072
- Threw it away?
Why?

38:58.423 --> 39:01.730
- I knew
you'd come up with something.

39:05.212 --> 39:07.127
- Huh.

39:34.110 --> 39:35.460
Hi.

39:35.503 --> 39:38.201
You look really nice.

39:38.245 --> 39:41.204
- So do you.
- Thanks.

39:41.248 --> 39:43.206
- Here you go.

39:43.250 --> 39:45.252
- Right.
Yeah.

39:48.734 --> 39:51.737
Um...

39:58.570 --> 40:02.617
I'm sorry.
I don't think I can do this.

40:04.097 --> 40:05.707
Thank God.
Me, neither.

40:05.751 --> 40:07.056
- Really?

40:07.100 --> 40:09.537
- Yeah, I feel incredibly
guilty just being here.

40:09.581 --> 40:10.799
And I know I shouldn't,
but I--

40:10.843 --> 40:14.760
- Yeah, no, it just
sneaks up on you, right?

40:18.894 --> 40:23.159
- My husband was a musician.

40:23.203 --> 40:24.639
He took his own life.

40:27.860 --> 40:29.688
- Sorry.

40:29.731 --> 40:31.429
- I don't talk
about that much.

40:31.472 --> 40:34.432
- Yeah, no--
- Ever.

40:34.475 --> 40:36.477
But the moment
I start to feel happiness,

40:36.521 --> 40:39.480
a wave of panic just...

40:39.524 --> 40:42.396
- Yeah.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.529
- Is that crazy
to be triggered by happiness?

40:44.572 --> 40:46.400
- No.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.361
- Sorry I ruined the evening.

40:51.405 --> 40:53.842
- No, I mean...

40:53.886 --> 40:57.150
you--you didn't.
You didn't ruin anything.

41:05.332 --> 41:08.770

41:08.814 --> 41:12.513

41:34.361 --> 41:35.884
