02:14.858 --> 02:16.722
- And we took the
horse to the water,

02:18.103 --> 02:20.795
'cause we knew it was thirsty.

02:20.830 --> 02:24.178
An old fool tried
to make it drink.

02:24.213 --> 02:25.152
No luck.

02:26.456 --> 02:28.182
It whinnied, and
extended itself.

02:28.217 --> 02:31.703
It pranced and it
kicked and it bucked.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.327
We were in a far place.

02:35.362 --> 02:37.295
He also was smooth
and moved well,

02:38.572 --> 02:39.780
and I could feel myself.

02:43.991 --> 02:48.582
We traveled to the other place
to meet the other stream,

02:48.616 --> 02:49.721
but it wouldn't drink.

02:51.688 --> 02:54.174
So I killed it.

02:56.314 --> 02:59.317
Because it was this
immediate horse.

03:03.424 --> 03:04.494
The horse should drink.

03:04.529 --> 03:06.496
The horse must drink.

03:06.531 --> 03:08.429
Because old fool thought it
needed drink.

03:10.328 --> 03:13.193
An old fool knows what's best
in the world for everyone.

03:26.585 --> 03:27.655
- I just wanted to
congratulate you

03:27.690 --> 03:29.554
on an exceptional performance.

03:29.588 --> 03:30.382
I'm James Young.

03:30.417 --> 03:31.556
- Oh well thank you sir.

03:31.590 --> 03:32.798
Gregory White.

03:32.833 --> 03:34.973
- I've invited the cast
back for some drinks.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.664
Michaela, my daughter,
is in the chorus.

03:36.699 --> 03:37.872
- Oh, right.

03:37.907 --> 03:39.391
- I'd be delighted
if you could join us.

03:39.426 --> 03:41.704
- I'd love to, but, I
have no transport arranged

03:41.738 --> 03:42.705
for later tonight.

03:42.739 --> 03:43.878
I live quite far, so.

03:43.913 --> 03:44.948
- That's not an issue.

03:44.983 --> 03:46.502
I can take you home.

03:46.536 --> 03:47.986
I look forward to seeing you.

04:03.312 --> 04:04.451
Tempting town.

04:05.555 --> 04:07.177
It's my local artist,
Jackie Hankson.

04:08.524 --> 04:11.147
It's part of this series,
Christ in Trinidad.

04:11.181 --> 04:12.010
I love it.

04:13.183 --> 04:14.702
He didn't wanna sell
this particular piece,

04:14.737 --> 04:17.671
but I made him an offer
he couldn't refuse.

04:17.704 --> 04:19.603
You say you're from Paramin?

04:19.637 --> 04:20.605
- Born and raised.

04:20.639 --> 04:21.916
- Aye, you go to
school up there?

04:21.951 --> 04:23.470
- I'm at St. Matthew's College.

04:24.540 --> 04:25.851
- Oh, really?

04:25.886 --> 04:27.301
- You sound surprised.

04:27.336 --> 04:29.717
- Oh, just that nephew didn't
get into St. Matthew's.

04:29.752 --> 04:31.029
You must be a bright young man.

04:31.063 --> 04:31.857
- Oh.

04:31.892 --> 04:33.169
I do okay.

04:33.203 --> 04:35.413
- Apparently a bit
better than okay.

04:35.447 --> 04:37.449
How did you come to
star in the play?

04:37.484 --> 04:39.555
- My English teacher
encouraged me to audition.

04:39.589 --> 04:41.142
- Ah, she saw your talent.

04:41.177 --> 04:44.284
- I think she felt I needed
a challenge, actually.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.319
- It's a good thing she did.

04:45.354 --> 04:46.493
You were really something.

04:46.527 --> 04:47.356
- Oh, thanks.

04:48.564 --> 04:49.875
- I'd love to see
you dance the Jab.

04:49.910 --> 04:51.946
I'll have to come up
to Paramin on Monday.

04:53.948 --> 04:54.846
Oh, Mel.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.330
Have you met our guest of honor?

04:56.365 --> 04:57.607
- Melvina.

04:57.642 --> 04:58.781
- Gregory.

04:58.815 --> 05:00.230
You have a lovely home, Mel.

05:00.265 --> 05:01.508
Thanks for having us all.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.096
- You recognize him, don't you?

05:04.131 --> 05:05.512
He was the star of the show.

05:06.685 --> 05:08.515
- Well James and I try
to go to the theater

05:08.549 --> 05:11.276
as much as we can,
don't we, darling?

05:12.622 --> 05:14.417
- It's getting quite
late now so I should

05:14.452 --> 05:15.694
probably be getting home.

05:15.729 --> 05:17.696
- Certainly, I'll
just get my keys.

05:22.391 --> 05:24.496
I won't be long.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.259
- This is a nice car.

05:30.537 --> 05:32.573
- Yeah, I certainly
appreciate it on these roads.

05:33.781 --> 05:36.163
- May I ask, what do
you do for a living?

05:36.197 --> 05:37.440
- I'm a businessman.

05:37.475 --> 05:39.546
I run the family business.

05:39.580 --> 05:43.446
Construction, mostly, but
we dabble in other things.

05:45.793 --> 05:48.417
What do you wanna do
when you finish school?

05:48.451 --> 05:50.626
- I'd love to be a
photojournalist, but,

05:50.660 --> 05:52.973
my grandmother wants me
to study medicine, so.

05:54.699 --> 05:56.079
- Oh, you like photography?

05:57.460 --> 05:59.635
- I want to travel and
love taking pictures, so,

05:59.669 --> 06:01.257
it seemed a good fit.

06:01.291 --> 06:03.363
- What sort of
camera do you use?

06:04.433 --> 06:05.261
- Um.

06:06.331 --> 06:07.781
I actually just use my phone.

06:10.162 --> 06:11.474
- So what are you gonna do?

06:12.855 --> 06:16.514
Are you gonna study
medicine, or photography?

06:17.894 --> 06:18.861
- I don't know yet.

06:20.897 --> 06:23.210
I can get a scholarship
abroad to do medicine,

06:24.349 --> 06:26.040
but there's nothing
for photography.

06:27.525 --> 06:28.388
- I see.

06:33.220 --> 06:34.186
- I live just here.

06:40.296 --> 06:41.539
Thank you for the lift.

06:41.573 --> 06:42.850
- Oh, it was my pleasure.

06:45.301 --> 06:46.544
Hey, don't be a stranger.

06:50.306 --> 06:51.272
That's my cell.

06:51.307 --> 06:52.412
Give me a call.

06:52.446 --> 06:53.413
- Thanks, mate.

07:08.945 --> 07:10.947
- I was wondering
where you went.

07:13.743 --> 07:15.400
- Sorry, Grammy.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.160
Went by a friend's
after the show.

07:17.195 --> 07:18.472
- So, how was the closer night?

07:18.507 --> 07:19.335
- It was great.

07:19.369 --> 07:20.163
- Yeah?

07:20.198 --> 07:21.579
- Everyone loved it.

07:21.613 --> 07:23.166
- That's fantastic, Greg.

07:24.374 --> 07:25.272
- Grammy, you know you
shouldn't fall asleep

07:25.306 --> 07:26.618
on the couch.

07:26.653 --> 07:27.481
Go to bed.

07:28.378 --> 07:30.208
- You coming with me tomorrow?

07:30.242 --> 07:32.969
- Why are you asking like I
have a choice in the matter?

07:33.004 --> 07:34.488
- You're just a good boy.

07:34.523 --> 07:37.733
- I know, and we all need
more time with the Lord.

07:37.767 --> 07:40.011
- We all need more time with--
- The Lord.

07:40.908 --> 07:43.463
♪ You are my God

07:43.497 --> 07:46.500

Fa--

11:49.674 --> 11:50.744
- Hey, Greg.

11:50.779 --> 11:51.711
It's James here.

11:52.988 --> 11:55.128
Listen, I'm headed to
Central on Saturday.

11:56.336 --> 11:57.544
I thought I could
bring my camera.

11:57.578 --> 11:59.615
You could join me
and take some photos.

11:59.649 --> 12:00.547
Let me know.

12:12.041 --> 12:13.733
Isn't he beautiful?

12:25.883 --> 12:26.746
Come on.

13:15.311 --> 13:16.554
Hey.

13:16.588 --> 13:17.866
- I love your camera, boy.

13:19.522 --> 13:20.351
- It suits you.

13:21.628 --> 13:23.250
- I got some really
good shots, too.

13:23.285 --> 13:24.873
- You'll have to show me.

13:24.907 --> 13:26.426
- Well, only if you're
showing me yours.

13:28.290 --> 13:30.430
- I can't remember the last
time I took a photo, Greg.

13:30.464 --> 13:32.259
I wouldn't know where
to start looking.

13:32.294 --> 13:34.330
- Why'd you stop
taking pictures?

13:34.365 --> 13:37.195
- I stopped doing a lot
things when I came back here.

13:37.230 --> 13:38.679
- Back from where?

13:38.714 --> 13:40.336
- England, boarding school.

13:40.371 --> 13:42.269
And then, kind of
hanging around,

13:42.304 --> 13:44.202
trying not to come back here.

13:44.237 --> 13:45.134
- Why you come back?

13:45.169 --> 13:46.308
Why not stay?

13:46.342 --> 13:47.861
- My father.

13:47.896 --> 13:49.518
He wanted me to come back
and take over the business

13:49.552 --> 13:51.520
and there's no
arguing with that man.

13:51.554 --> 13:52.383
Here I am.

13:53.798 --> 13:55.869
- At least your father
cares what happens to you.

13:55.904 --> 13:56.905
My father don't care.

13:58.423 --> 13:59.493
- Don't say that.

13:59.528 --> 14:00.563
That's not true.

14:00.598 --> 14:01.392
- No, it's true.

14:03.083 --> 14:03.877
No matter.

14:03.912 --> 14:04.774
I don't need him, so.

14:07.053 --> 14:07.881
- I'm sorry.

14:17.028 --> 14:18.927
- I really want to
study abroad, though.

14:21.964 --> 14:24.518
- Well maybe
medicine's your ticket.

14:24.553 --> 14:25.381
- I guess.

14:26.693 --> 14:28.626
It's just not in
my heart, you know?

14:30.559 --> 14:32.250
- You should listen
to your heart.

14:33.942 --> 14:36.496
If I could do it all over
again, that's what I'd do.

14:40.949 --> 14:42.847
You ever been to Balandra?

14:42.882 --> 14:44.021
- Actually, I have.

14:44.055 --> 14:46.195
Once with my mother,
when I was young, yeah.

14:47.714 --> 14:49.716
- I got a beach house up there.

14:49.750 --> 14:51.200
I was thinking that
we could go up there

14:51.235 --> 14:52.822
and hang out, spend the night.

14:53.962 --> 14:55.480
Look at some photos.

14:55.515 --> 14:56.343
It'll be fun.

14:57.724 --> 14:58.932
- When?

14:58.967 --> 15:00.106
- It'd have to be this weekend.

15:00.140 --> 15:02.142
Next weekend's--
- Carnival.

15:02.177 --> 15:03.626
- Someone's gotta
play the Devil.

15:07.182 --> 15:09.391
- I think I could
make that happen.

15:09.425 --> 15:10.254
- Cool.

15:11.255 --> 15:12.670
Give me a call, let me know.

15:24.993 --> 15:26.891
- You can just let me
off here, actually.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.272
This is fine.
- Not going home?

15:28.306 --> 15:30.515
- No, I think I'll pass
by a friend's first.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.656
But thanks for the opportunity.

15:33.691 --> 15:35.106
The day was real good.

15:35.141 --> 15:36.590
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.

15:36.625 --> 15:39.179
- Yeah, I really enjoy
shooting with your camera.

15:39.214 --> 15:40.525
- Why don't you hold onto it?

15:40.560 --> 15:43.080
I'm pretty sure I won't
be needing it this week.

15:43.114 --> 15:44.357
- You sure?
- Take it.

15:45.979 --> 15:46.842
- Thanks, James.

17:55.660 --> 17:56.454
- Gregory.

17:56.489 --> 17:58.111
Excellent test.

17:58.146 --> 17:59.354
If you keep up like
this, you've got

17:59.388 --> 18:00.838
a great shot at
that scholarship.

18:00.872 --> 18:01.908
- Thanks, Miss Williams.

18:01.942 --> 18:04.083
- Alright.

19:21.332 --> 19:22.540
- Hey Greg.

19:22.575 --> 19:24.024
Hey listen, my son
just came home.

19:24.991 --> 19:26.165
Okay, fine, yeah, yeah.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.027
Bye bye.

19:28.408 --> 19:29.858
Hey Gregory.

19:29.892 --> 19:30.686
- Hey.

19:30.721 --> 19:31.549
- How you been?

19:32.757 --> 19:33.689
- Fine, and you?

19:33.724 --> 19:34.690
- Hanging in there.

19:37.728 --> 19:39.419
Just came home
from school, I see.

19:40.627 --> 19:41.456
- Yep.

19:43.285 --> 19:46.426
- Eh, and Grammy's been
coming home late these days?

19:46.461 --> 19:48.221
- She's working
for a new family.

19:48.256 --> 19:50.050
Cooks them dinner, so,

19:50.085 --> 19:52.294
we don't usually see each
other until after eight.

19:54.503 --> 19:55.332
- I see.

19:58.335 --> 19:59.543
Oh, you're looking good.

20:00.751 --> 20:02.753
Put on some height
since I last saw you.

20:03.892 --> 20:04.720
- Thanks.

20:06.343 --> 20:07.171
- Yeah.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.034
Playing any ball?

20:09.208 --> 20:10.243
- No, not really.

20:10.278 --> 20:11.624
- You should.

20:11.658 --> 20:14.005
You'd make a damn good shooter.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.594
- You're thinking of Fayne, Dad.

20:16.629 --> 20:19.218
- Oh, is he still playing?

20:19.252 --> 20:21.668
- Less than he used
to, but, he plays.

20:23.463 --> 20:25.189
- That's good to hear.

20:28.123 --> 20:29.193
- Well.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.712
I gotta study, so.

20:31.954 --> 20:33.956
- Alright, sounds great.

21:11.615 --> 21:12.961
- Hey.

21:15.584 --> 21:16.827
- What?

21:18.035 --> 21:19.554
- Pa's back.

21:19.588 --> 21:20.831
- What?

24:26.879 --> 24:27.673
- Hello?

24:27.707 --> 24:28.605
- James here.

24:29.675 --> 24:30.503
- It's Gregory.

24:30.538 --> 24:32.332
- Hey, Greg.

24:32.367 --> 24:33.437
- I just wanted to let you know

24:33.472 --> 24:34.990
that I can make the weekend.

24:35.025 --> 24:36.923
- Oh, that's fantastic.

24:36.958 --> 24:38.787
Saturday around three pm?

24:38.822 --> 24:40.064
Where should I pick you up?

24:40.099 --> 24:40.858
- You can pick me
up at the junction

24:40.893 --> 24:42.204
opposite the taxi stand.

24:42.239 --> 24:43.102
- Great.

24:43.136 --> 24:43.930
- Okay.

24:43.965 --> 24:44.793
Bye.

24:45.829 --> 24:46.657
Yes, Gran?

24:49.488 --> 24:51.282
- How are you doin'?

24:51.317 --> 24:52.525
- Not so bad.

24:52.560 --> 24:53.422
Can't complain.

24:55.010 --> 24:57.116
- You're not hungry, I see.

24:57.150 --> 24:58.013
- No, not really.

25:01.051 --> 25:02.259
- You saw your father?

25:05.055 --> 25:07.402
- I saw him when I got home.

25:09.335 --> 25:11.648
- I understand Fayne
had some words with him.

25:12.821 --> 25:14.616
- Fayne's looking
out for you, Grammy.

25:16.584 --> 25:17.585
- I appreciate that.

25:18.620 --> 25:19.483
But I'll be fine.

25:22.797 --> 25:25.178
He's only staying a
short while, you know.

25:25.213 --> 25:26.041
- Right.

25:28.975 --> 25:31.599
- When you have your own
children, you'll understand.

25:34.636 --> 25:35.810
With all his missteps,

25:37.674 --> 25:38.882
I still love him.

25:38.916 --> 25:39.986
- Missteps, Grammy?

25:41.125 --> 25:42.644
That's an understatement.

25:42.679 --> 25:44.508
- It is what it is.

25:46.475 --> 25:48.063
- It's your house, Grammy.

25:48.098 --> 25:50.341
It's not up to me to
decide what you do here.

25:51.653 --> 25:53.310
- I just want us all to be okay.

25:58.764 --> 25:59.868
That's my only prayer.

26:04.632 --> 26:05.667
- Grammy?

26:05.702 --> 26:07.255
- Hm?

26:07.289 --> 26:08.601
- I may go to the
east coast for a night

26:08.636 --> 26:10.672
this weekend with the cast.

26:10.707 --> 26:13.399
Just a small line to
celebrate the showing.

26:13.433 --> 26:14.711
- You're lucky.

26:14.745 --> 26:16.091
That's so nice.

26:16.126 --> 26:18.542
- I'll be back in
time for church, too.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.923
- Don't worry.

26:19.957 --> 26:21.649
I'm sure the Lord will
understand if you miss a mass.

26:21.683 --> 26:22.926
- I'll be back.

26:24.341 --> 26:25.549
- Good night, son.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.688
- Night, Granny.

28:55.941 --> 28:57.701
- Grammy, you seen
my best shirt?

28:57.736 --> 28:59.876
- It needs a press.

29:36.326 --> 29:37.430
- Good to go?

30:29.448 --> 30:30.449
Here we are.

30:32.002 --> 30:33.762
I'm just gonna go put
these groceries down.

30:33.797 --> 30:34.971
- You want help?

30:35.005 --> 30:36.765
- Oh no, it's okay; you relax.

30:36.800 --> 30:39.216
Have a little look around
and I'll be right down.

31:27.195 --> 31:28.162
What do you think?

31:33.029 --> 31:34.064
- It's intense.

31:37.412 --> 31:38.310
- You gonna go in?

31:39.518 --> 31:40.691
- I think so.

32:38.922 --> 32:42.546
- You never told me what your
grandmother does for a living.

32:42.581 --> 32:44.928
- She's a housekeeper
in Maraval.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.723
She works late, so, I
end up doing most of

32:46.757 --> 32:48.311
the cooking anyway.

32:48.345 --> 32:49.795
- No siblings?

32:49.829 --> 32:51.038
- One brother.

32:51.072 --> 32:52.108
- That's right,
you mentioned him.

32:52.142 --> 32:53.040
What's his story?

32:54.938 --> 32:57.113
- He farms and smokes
a lot of weed, so.

32:57.147 --> 32:57.976
- He's older?

32:59.598 --> 33:00.806
- Yeah.

33:00.840 --> 33:02.428
- So how did you come
to be who you are?

33:03.636 --> 33:05.121
- And who is that?

33:05.155 --> 33:07.606
- Well the gifted,
sensitive young man

33:07.640 --> 33:09.228
who I have no doubt will go far.

33:11.575 --> 33:12.611
Someone's to credit.

33:14.406 --> 33:16.201
- My Grammy, I suppose.

33:16.235 --> 33:17.478
She's a real bright lady.

33:18.375 --> 33:19.480
- You love her a lot.

33:22.069 --> 33:22.931
A toast.

33:25.520 --> 33:27.350
To the beginning of
something special.

33:32.596 --> 33:34.322
You could have
brought a lady friend.

33:34.357 --> 33:35.772
If there is such a person.

33:36.980 --> 33:38.671
- Oh, no, there's
no one like that.

33:40.052 --> 33:41.191
- Why is that?

33:41.226 --> 33:43.297
Such a talented, good
looking young man.

33:44.919 --> 33:46.714
- My focus is in school.

33:46.748 --> 33:47.784
Girls are stress, so.

33:49.096 --> 33:50.787
- You've have a
girlfriend before, though?

33:50.821 --> 33:51.650
- Of course.

33:53.065 --> 33:54.032
- Ever been in love?

33:57.138 --> 33:57.966
- No.

33:58.001 --> 33:58.829
I don't think so.

34:02.937 --> 34:05.043
- When we first married,

34:05.077 --> 34:07.252
I thought I was in love, but,

34:07.286 --> 34:09.081
I don't think it
was love after all.

34:10.565 --> 34:13.120
Certainly not the kind of love
that poems are written about.

34:13.154 --> 34:15.190
- What kind of love is that?

34:15.225 --> 34:17.089
- We haven't been
lovers in over a decade.

34:17.123 --> 34:19.746
I have no passion for my wife.

34:19.781 --> 34:21.059
- So why do you stay?

34:21.092 --> 34:22.094
- Michaela's my everything.

34:22.129 --> 34:23.061
I stay for her.

34:25.786 --> 34:27.789
- Do you want some more?

34:29.481 --> 34:30.309
- Thanks.

34:34.002 --> 34:35.487
We should have a
look at your photos.

34:51.364 --> 34:53.056
- I'm nervous to share these.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.299
- You're nervous?

34:54.333 --> 34:55.231
You're just getting
used to the camera.

34:55.264 --> 34:56.679
There's no pressure here.

34:56.715 --> 34:57.854
- Okay, well like I said,

34:57.888 --> 34:59.683
there's only a few
strong pictures anyways.

34:59.718 --> 35:02.307
- Okay.

35:02.341 --> 35:03.170
- Okay.

35:04.343 --> 35:05.275
- See?

35:05.310 --> 35:06.483
I love that.
- Ah, thanks.

35:06.518 --> 35:08.175
I should have gotten
closer, though.

35:10.384 --> 35:11.730
- That's interesting.

35:11.764 --> 35:13.145
- Yeah, I asked him
to pose like that.

35:13.180 --> 35:15.458
Thought it'd make
a strong portrait.

35:15.492 --> 35:18.012
- Look at those eyes, and
those lines on his face.

35:19.082 --> 35:20.152
A sign of a hard life.

35:25.502 --> 35:27.125
Now that's my favorite so far.

35:27.159 --> 35:28.436
Really strong image, Greg.

35:29.575 --> 35:30.921
- Oh, thanks.

35:35.616 --> 35:37.031
- And who is that?

35:37.065 --> 35:38.619
- Oh that's my boy, Dev.

35:38.653 --> 35:39.896
- That's right,
you mentioned him.

35:39.930 --> 35:43.071
- Yeah, we were just
mucking about, yeah?

35:43.106 --> 35:43.900
- He's good looking.

35:43.934 --> 35:45.143
- I guess.

35:45.177 --> 35:47.386
- Not a St. Matthew's
boy, I can see that.

35:47.421 --> 35:49.147
- Yeah, no, not
exactly a scholar.

35:54.635 --> 35:55.532
I guess that's it.

36:01.020 --> 36:02.643
- Your images are
really stunning, Greg.

36:02.677 --> 36:04.265
More than just a few good shots.

36:05.611 --> 36:06.923
- You're just saying that.

36:08.821 --> 36:09.650
- Why would I?

36:11.238 --> 36:12.308
- 'Cause you like me.

36:16.726 --> 36:17.830
- What do you wanna do now?

36:21.627 --> 36:22.870
- I'm good with whatever.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.780
- We'll watch an effect?

36:38.955 --> 36:39.956
You like porn, Greg?

36:41.751 --> 36:42.786
- Sometimes.

36:45.444 --> 36:46.687
- You uncomfortable?

36:46.721 --> 36:48.275
Sorry, you struck me
as someone who would

36:48.309 --> 36:49.724
be open to this.

36:49.759 --> 36:51.070
- What makes you say that?

36:53.452 --> 36:54.488
- You ever been with a man?

36:56.731 --> 36:57.560
You have.

37:00.252 --> 37:02.220
- I messed around with my
best friend when we was kids.

37:02.254 --> 37:03.255
Nothing serious.

37:15.302 --> 37:17.027
I don't think this
is a good idea.

37:19.444 --> 37:22.274
- Do you want me to stop?

37:25.864 --> 37:29.005
If you tell me to
stop, I will, Gregory.

38:35.105 --> 38:35.934
Morning.

38:41.008 --> 38:41.940
Is everything okay?

38:43.113 --> 38:43.942
- Oh, fine.

38:47.186 --> 38:48.981
- I was gonna fix
us some breakfast.

38:50.638 --> 38:52.364
- Listen, I really
need to get back, okay?

38:58.370 --> 39:00.890
- I was thinking maybe of
leaving in an hour or so.

39:01.925 --> 39:02.754
- Cool.

39:04.721 --> 39:07.310
- So, no breakfast for you?

39:07.345 --> 39:08.691
- No thanks.

39:08.725 --> 39:09.554
Not hungry.

39:11.349 --> 39:12.177
- Alright.

39:13.109 --> 39:14.041
See you at the top.

39:34.441 --> 39:35.511
You forgot something.

39:37.823 --> 39:39.929
Don't you wanna hang on to this?

39:39.963 --> 39:41.724
- No, thanks.

39:41.758 --> 39:43.139
Well out of work this week.

40:02.054 --> 40:02.883
Tsk.

40:08.923 --> 40:09.924
Come hither, hither, hither.

41:50.956 --> 41:52.268
- You want something to eat?

41:52.302 --> 41:53.269
- I'm good, thanks.

41:54.788 --> 41:56.617
- So how was the line?

41:56.652 --> 41:58.170
You never tell me.

41:59.447 --> 42:00.276
- Good.

42:01.104 --> 42:03.728
- Lots of pretty girls?

42:03.762 --> 42:05.350
- Some nice girls, Grammy.

42:05.384 --> 42:06.213
- But not good.

42:07.352 --> 42:08.698
You need to have some fun.

42:10.458 --> 42:11.494
I worry about you,

42:12.495 --> 42:14.221
thinking on things so heavy.

42:16.464 --> 42:18.363
- Life feels heavy
these days, Grammy.

42:19.675 --> 42:20.538
- I know.

42:22.229 --> 42:23.541
Sorry things didn't work
out with your father.

42:26.785 --> 42:30.237
- Grammy, you had to start
seeing him for who he is.

42:32.964 --> 42:34.966
He's never gonna be the
man you want him to be.

42:49.256 --> 42:50.947
- Alright man,
I'll see you later.

43:02.062 --> 43:04.133
- You really are
forgetful, you know that?

43:04.167 --> 43:05.306
- What are you talking about?

43:05.341 --> 43:06.480
- Your photos.

43:06.514 --> 43:07.792
Don't you want them?

43:07.826 --> 43:08.620
- Thanks.

43:10.657 --> 43:12.003
- Why don't you let
me drop you home?

43:12.037 --> 43:12.935
- No, thanks.

43:12.969 --> 43:15.006
I'd rather take a maxi.

43:15.040 --> 43:16.248
- I just wanna talk.

43:16.283 --> 43:18.043
I wanna put all
of this behind us.

43:20.805 --> 43:22.047
Come on Greg.

43:22.082 --> 43:23.255
Let me give you a ride.

43:39.030 --> 43:41.135
You've been struggling
with what happened.

43:41.170 --> 43:42.274
I'm sorry.

43:42.309 --> 43:43.413
- I'm not studying it.

43:44.587 --> 43:46.658
People do things all
the time they regret.

43:46.693 --> 43:48.384
The Lord understands
these things.

43:50.179 --> 43:52.837
- I used to feel that
way when I was your age.

43:52.871 --> 43:54.528
A lot of shame.

43:54.562 --> 43:55.805
- I didn't say I felt shame.

43:56.703 --> 43:57.911
- But you do.

43:57.945 --> 43:59.188
- What do you want
from me, James?

44:00.396 --> 44:01.604
Seriously.

44:01.639 --> 44:04.296
I'm 18, I'm poor,
and I have nothing.

44:04.331 --> 44:06.436
So what could you
possibly want from me?

44:07.265 --> 44:08.991
- You're different.

44:09.025 --> 44:09.923
You're sensitive.

44:09.957 --> 44:10.855
You don't belong.

44:12.235 --> 44:14.306
You remind me myself
when I was your age.

44:15.653 --> 44:17.551
- James, you are cheating
on your marriage.

44:17.585 --> 44:19.553
- That's my brooder, not yours.

44:19.587 --> 44:21.072
- Well I can't do this, James.

44:22.867 --> 44:23.695
I'm sorry.

44:25.076 --> 44:26.077
It's not me.

46:57.573 --> 47:00.818
- I'm so glad to meet you
as a friend of my Gregory.

47:00.852 --> 47:03.027
So where do you
know him from again?

47:03.061 --> 47:05.408
- My daughter's in
the same play as him.

47:05.443 --> 47:06.616
Michaela.

47:06.651 --> 47:07.514
I don't know if
he's mentioned her.

47:07.548 --> 47:09.205
- You swear?
- Yes.

47:09.240 --> 47:11.829
- I didn't get a chance.

47:12.864 --> 47:14.038
Morning, son.

47:14.072 --> 47:14.901
- Morning.

47:16.143 --> 47:18.352
- You, um, left this in
my car the other day.

47:18.387 --> 47:20.872
I was up here on a
project and I thought I'd

47:20.907 --> 47:23.012
swing by a drop it off for you.

47:23.047 --> 47:25.670
- I had no idea that my
boy was even interested

47:25.704 --> 47:26.671
in taking pictures.

47:28.224 --> 47:29.881
He's so talented.

47:29.916 --> 47:31.365
I can't keep track.

47:32.228 --> 47:33.091
This boy is blessed.

47:34.541 --> 47:36.819
- My daughter thinks
the world of him.

47:38.407 --> 47:40.685
- We've been meaning
to fix the roof,

47:40.719 --> 47:42.169
but I'm trying to save
a little something

47:42.204 --> 47:43.584
for Greg for school.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.415
He tell you he's trying
for a scholarship abroad?

47:46.449 --> 47:47.588
- He did.

47:47.623 --> 47:48.727
That's fantastic.

47:48.762 --> 47:50.350
- They pay for room and board,

47:50.384 --> 47:52.283
but he have to get
the spending money.

47:53.456 --> 47:56.149
And I know that is not
easy with a growing boy.

47:56.183 --> 47:57.564
- I'm in construction.

47:57.598 --> 47:59.014
Why don't you let me
get a couple of guys

47:59.048 --> 48:00.912
up here to help with the roof?

48:00.947 --> 48:03.915
- Mr. Young, thank
you, but no thank you.

48:03.950 --> 48:05.434
That is a lot to do.

48:05.468 --> 48:08.230
- Oh, we do it all the time
as charity for our church.

48:08.264 --> 48:10.508
It's not a big deal, honestly.

48:10.542 --> 48:11.923
I'd like to help.

48:11.958 --> 48:14.822
- Well, it's been
leaking for a long time.

48:16.031 --> 48:18.826
Gregory's room is much
worse to be honest.

48:18.861 --> 48:20.311
Poor soul.

48:20.345 --> 48:21.484
- Oh, could I have a look?

48:21.519 --> 48:22.727
- I'd rather you didn't.

48:25.419 --> 48:26.938
My room is fine.

48:26.973 --> 48:28.077
- Fine?

48:28.112 --> 48:29.872
Cover your room leaking
like a bust pipe.

48:29.907 --> 48:31.287
- Grammy, please.

48:31.322 --> 48:33.220
- What you think Mr. Young
never seen a messy room before?

48:33.255 --> 48:34.428
- Michaela's the worst.

48:34.463 --> 48:36.154
I guarantee you
have nothing on her.

48:48.132 --> 48:50.686
Six sheets of
galvanized should do it.

48:50.720 --> 48:52.274
- I'm late.

48:52.308 --> 48:53.965
- Where are
your manners, Greg?

48:54.000 --> 48:55.449
You aren't gonna
thank Mr. Young?

48:59.902 --> 49:01.214
- Thank you, Mr. Young.

49:01.248 --> 49:03.285
- It's my pleasure,
I'm happy to help.

49:36.801 --> 49:38.182
- Okay, time's up.

49:50.090 --> 49:51.160
- Mr. Young,
there's a Gregory waiting

49:51.195 --> 49:52.541
to see you, sir.

49:55.233 --> 49:56.027
- Uh, go ahead.

49:56.062 --> 49:57.063
Send him in.

50:03.276 --> 50:05.174
- What were thinking showing
up at my house this morning?

50:06.210 --> 50:07.797
- I was just
returning your images.

50:07.832 --> 50:09.109
- You should ask me first.

50:10.248 --> 50:11.180
- I'm sorry.

50:11.215 --> 50:12.319
I meant nothing by it.

50:16.151 --> 50:17.221
It's good to see you.

50:22.088 --> 50:25.194
Darlene did some research
on photography programs.

50:25.229 --> 50:28.232
There are a couple of good
ones on the east coast.

50:28.266 --> 50:30.924
I thought you might
like to take a look.

50:30.958 --> 50:33.616
Maybe we can talk about
it, if you'd like.

50:33.651 --> 50:35.239
- There's nothing to talk about.

50:36.102 --> 50:37.655
I have no money for art school.

50:38.863 --> 50:40.554
- Well that's what I
wanted to talk about.

50:40.589 --> 50:42.384
Maybe I can help.

50:42.418 --> 50:44.041
- I need to go.

50:44.075 --> 50:45.145
- Whoa, why the rush?

50:48.700 --> 50:51.151
You came all this way
to see me, didn't you?

50:56.812 --> 50:58.331
- I need you to understand
how uncomfortable

50:58.365 --> 50:59.815
you're making me, James.

51:00.988 --> 51:02.093
- You're not the only
one with something

51:02.128 --> 51:03.094
to lose here, Greg.

51:11.102 --> 51:12.034
I'm glad you came.

51:23.701 --> 51:25.599
- I want you to leave
me alone, James.

51:28.568 --> 51:29.362
Please.

51:31.157 --> 51:33.020
I'm asking you to
leave me alone.

54:15.113 --> 54:16.218
Yo Greg.

54:16.253 --> 54:17.012
You mind taking
guest Stacey tonight,

54:17.046 --> 54:18.876
Tamara's staying by me.

54:20.498 --> 54:21.327
- Yeah, sure.

54:27.229 --> 54:28.023
Where you live?

54:28.057 --> 54:29.921
I'll walk you home.

54:29.956 --> 54:31.164
- That'll be a long walk.

54:31.198 --> 54:32.545
I live in town.

54:32.579 --> 54:33.408
- In town?

54:34.719 --> 54:36.514
- Nah, I was staying by
Tamara's house tonight.

54:36.549 --> 54:38.102
I didn't realize that she
and Devin were gonna--

54:38.136 --> 54:39.206
- That's okay.

54:39.241 --> 54:40.173
You can stay by me.

54:41.070 --> 54:41.899
I have a couch.

54:42.969 --> 54:44.626
- I appreciate that.

54:58.950 --> 54:59.917
- I hope it's okay.

55:01.643 --> 55:03.023
- It's fine.

55:03.058 --> 55:04.956
- My Gran wakes up
early, so, don't worry if

55:04.991 --> 55:06.372
you hear she knocking about.

55:07.994 --> 55:09.306
- Wouldn't she find
it strange to see me

55:09.340 --> 55:10.928
sleeping on her couch?

55:10.962 --> 55:12.170
- No, she's cool.

55:12.205 --> 55:13.724
It'll be fine when I
explain what happened.

55:15.519 --> 55:16.692
Well.

55:16.727 --> 55:18.660
Let me know if
you need anything.

57:01.245 --> 57:02.004
- Gregory.

57:05.663 --> 57:07.389
Why are there
sheets on the couch?

57:13.326 --> 57:14.983
- A friend was
gonna sleep there.

57:15.811 --> 57:17.572
- Who is this friend?

57:17.606 --> 57:19.746
- You don't know the person.

57:19.781 --> 57:21.299
- Who is it, Greg?

57:21.334 --> 57:23.094
And where is the person now?

57:27.582 --> 57:29.169
- She name is Stacey.

57:29.204 --> 57:30.481
She's sleeping in my room.

57:34.002 --> 57:36.729
- I hope you know what
you're doing, you know.

57:36.763 --> 57:38.834
You're far too gifted
to get caught up

57:38.869 --> 57:41.319
in some young girl's nonsense.

57:41.354 --> 57:42.148
You hear me?

57:43.632 --> 57:44.461
- Yes, Gran.

57:45.634 --> 57:46.877
- You have a chance to
do what I would have

57:46.911 --> 57:49.086
given my whole life to do.

57:50.674 --> 57:53.090
You'll break my heart if
you waste this opportunity,

57:53.124 --> 57:53.953
you know?

57:55.023 --> 57:56.542
You'll break my heart.

57:56.576 --> 57:57.922
- You don't have to
worry Gran, I'm gonna--

57:57.957 --> 57:59.199
- No.

57:59.234 --> 58:01.132
I didn't think so
until this morning.

58:03.756 --> 58:05.620
It's not like you
to be so reckless.

58:07.242 --> 58:08.381
Tsk.

58:08.415 --> 58:09.209
- Gran I--

59:26.010 --> 59:27.322
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:27.356 --> 59:28.185
I know.

59:34.501 --> 59:35.710
I'll call you back later.

01:00:03.427 --> 01:00:04.255
Fayne.

01:00:16.302 --> 01:00:18.787
- Here you go, Gran.

01:00:19.719 --> 01:00:20.789
- Thanks, Greg.

01:00:33.664 --> 01:00:34.941
You know what he is up to?

01:00:35.908 --> 01:00:37.254
- Grammy, I had no idea.

01:00:41.292 --> 01:00:44.882
- I don't know why the boy
had to be so damn hard.

01:00:47.022 --> 01:00:48.645
- He took mom's death real hard.

01:00:49.853 --> 01:00:51.924
- I know, but, that
is no excuse for him

01:00:51.958 --> 01:00:53.304
to be so hard to us.

01:00:53.339 --> 01:00:55.928
- I'm just saying that,

01:00:55.962 --> 01:00:57.688
it wasn't easy for him.

01:00:57.723 --> 01:00:59.552
- Well jail not easy either.

01:01:02.313 --> 01:01:03.142
Tsk.

01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:09.873
Where the hell am I going
to find this boy bail, Greg?

01:01:09.907 --> 01:01:10.736
Hm?

01:01:13.635 --> 01:01:14.947
I work too hard.

01:01:17.294 --> 01:01:18.122
I'm tired.

01:01:20.159 --> 01:01:22.264
- I know, Grammy, I know.

01:01:24.335 --> 01:01:25.854
- I don't know.

01:01:25.889 --> 01:01:27.822
I work too hard, Greg.

01:01:27.856 --> 01:01:30.963
- We'll think of
something to happen.

01:01:32.378 --> 01:01:34.104
Grammy, we'll think
of something else.

01:01:59.785 --> 01:02:00.993
What's he doing here?

01:02:01.027 --> 01:02:03.754
- He's just showing a
neighborhood man around.

01:02:03.789 --> 01:02:07.206
I was talking to
him about Fayne.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.655
- What about Fayne?

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:10.209
- Well he says he knows
a lot of people in

01:02:10.243 --> 01:02:12.073
the justice system.

01:02:12.107 --> 01:02:14.006
He's willing to help
us with the bail.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.524
- What are you talking about?

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:20.115
Grammy, I, I don't think we
should take that man's money.

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.944
- Why not?

01:02:20.978 --> 01:02:22.117
- 'Cause it's not fair.

01:02:26.466 --> 01:02:27.778
Grammy, nothing comes
for free in this world.

01:02:27.813 --> 01:02:29.055
You know that.

01:02:30.677 --> 01:02:32.921
You don't think he wants
something in return?

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:37.063
And besides, Fayne is grown.

01:02:38.237 --> 01:02:40.204
At some point he has
to be help accountable

01:02:40.239 --> 01:02:41.792
for his own actions.

01:02:41.827 --> 01:02:43.898
- But the Lord says we
must accept the blessings

01:02:43.932 --> 01:02:44.761
that he bestow.

01:02:46.245 --> 01:02:47.418
If Mr. Young is willing to help,

01:02:47.453 --> 01:02:49.835
I can't think of a
bigger gift than that.

01:02:49.869 --> 01:02:52.596
That is the Lord at
work this morning, son.

01:05:06.557 --> 01:05:07.386
- Hello?

01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:09.698
Yes, it is.

01:05:11.252 --> 01:05:12.080
Yes, sir.

01:05:14.013 --> 01:05:14.876
Okay.

01:05:16.257 --> 01:05:17.568
Friday the 11th?

01:05:19.122 --> 01:05:19.916
Fine.

01:05:21.434 --> 01:05:22.228
Yes.

01:05:22.263 --> 01:05:23.678
Yes, I'll be there.

01:05:24.541 --> 01:05:25.542
Thank you very much.

01:05:27.785 --> 01:05:30.409
That was Officer Cross.

01:05:30.443 --> 01:05:32.929
Apparently they set a
court date for Fayne.

01:05:32.963 --> 01:05:35.138
Friday the 11th
at eight o'clock.

01:05:36.449 --> 01:05:39.004
I guess that's when
they will set the bail.

01:05:39.038 --> 01:05:40.764
- You gonna take
the day off work?

01:05:42.007 --> 01:05:42.904
- I don't have a choice.

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.043
Somebody has to be there.

01:05:45.217 --> 01:05:46.425
- Well I can talk to my
teachers and ask for--

01:05:46.459 --> 01:05:47.460
- You crazy?

01:05:48.841 --> 01:05:52.189
You are not to miss a
minute of school over this.

01:05:52.224 --> 01:05:53.190
You hear me?

01:05:54.847 --> 01:05:55.848
- Yes, Gran.

01:06:01.026 --> 01:06:01.819
- And Greg?

01:06:04.339 --> 01:06:06.583
I want to give Mr. Young
the money I've been saving

01:06:06.617 --> 01:06:07.549
for you for school.

01:06:09.068 --> 01:06:10.000
- What?

01:06:10.035 --> 01:06:12.140
- You were right.

01:06:12.175 --> 01:06:14.936
It wouldn't be fair to
have him pay all of it.

01:06:17.628 --> 01:06:18.595
- Yes, Gran.

01:07:03.122 --> 01:07:06.470
- Wait a second Greg, I want
to talk to you after class.

01:07:12.752 --> 01:07:13.926
What happened?

01:07:14.858 --> 01:07:15.755
- I don't know.

01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:16.998
- Did you study?

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.206
- Apparently not enough.

01:07:19.345 --> 01:07:21.002
- This could really
hurt you, Greg.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:22.866
- I know, ma'am.

01:07:24.247 --> 01:07:26.352
- Can you look at me
for a second, please?

01:07:28.113 --> 01:07:30.115
If there was something going on,

01:07:30.149 --> 01:07:32.669
do you have someone that
you can trust to talk to?

01:07:34.947 --> 01:07:35.810
- I think I'm okay.

01:07:37.225 --> 01:07:38.054
- Okay.

01:07:39.676 --> 01:07:40.849
Well, I'm here.

01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:43.059
If you need me.

01:07:44.819 --> 01:07:45.958
- Thank you, ma'am.

01:17:12.697 --> 01:17:15.631
- Well look who,
the devil himself.

01:17:15.665 --> 01:17:17.598
- Why are fucking
with me, James?

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:18.841
- I couldn't miss
seeing you play.

01:17:18.875 --> 01:17:20.083
- I asked you to leave me alone.

01:17:20.118 --> 01:17:23.224
What about that you
don't understand?

01:17:23.259 --> 01:17:24.950
I'm telling you, James.

01:17:24.985 --> 01:17:26.089
I'm telling you.

01:17:26.124 --> 01:17:28.609
Leave me the fuck alone.

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:31.508
- Leaving you alone isn't
gonna change anything.

01:17:31.543 --> 01:17:33.062
Let me tell you something.

01:17:33.096 --> 01:17:36.134
No liquor, no woman, no priest,

01:17:36.168 --> 01:17:39.793
not even God himself,
is gonna change the fact

01:17:39.827 --> 01:17:41.622
that you like fucking men.

01:17:44.107 --> 01:17:45.833
Stop fighting me!

01:17:47.628 --> 01:17:48.698
Stop!

01:17:59.916 --> 01:18:01.021
- James.

01:18:01.055 --> 01:18:03.195
James, oh fuck, James.

01:18:03.230 --> 01:18:04.714
James, wake up.

01:18:04.749 --> 01:18:05.646
James.

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:06.509
James.

01:18:07.855 --> 01:18:08.684
James.
