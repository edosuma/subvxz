00:21.120 --> 00:22.710
Punk?

00:22.840 --> 00:23.340
What?

00:23.440 --> 00:24.430
Are you planning on spending
the night in there?

00:24.720 --> 00:27.160
I'll be right out, I'm taking
a shit, I'll be right out.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.680
What, I can't even take a shit anymore?

00:33.840 --> 00:35.560
You're the only one everyone's waiting for.

00:40.320 --> 00:41.310
Do whatever you want.

00:53.960 --> 00:57.030
So, Gyčiukas, are you ready?

00:57.120 --> 00:57.790
Always.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.870
We're gonna make some
noise tonight, aren't we?

01:00.240 --> 01:01.150
Huh?

01:03.600 --> 01:04.950
Applause!

01:05.080 --> 01:06.440
Thank you, that's not necessary...

01:08.200 --> 01:09.160
Where's my guitar?

01:09.280 --> 01:10.560
You think that's normal?

01:10.880 --> 01:11.870
What?

01:12.040 --> 01:14.560
You're in a complete coma,
have you seen yourself?

01:15.880 --> 01:16.920
What?

01:19.240 --> 01:20.560
Come on, everything's fine.

01:21.120 --> 01:23.270
Calm down a little, give me a little.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.550
Hey...

01:27.600 --> 01:29.080
What is this?

01:30.480 --> 01:31.120
Eww, what the fuck is this?

01:31.200 --> 01:32.160
Water.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.720
Punk, this is already the
fourth gig like this.

01:36.720 --> 01:37.220
Mhm.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.480
No one wants to book you anymore.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.440
Come on, don't be an
embarrassment to me or...

01:44.800 --> 01:47.240
Hmmm, embarrassment?

01:47.320 --> 01:49.310
What embarrassment, Gytis.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.840
Gytis...

01:53.000 --> 01:54.400
Who's the star, huh?

01:54.400 --> 01:55.390
You're the star.

01:57.120 --> 01:57.870
Yeah.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.150
Hold this.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.550
Mm. Let's make them shit
themselves today, huh, Gyčiukas?

02:10.880 --> 02:11.880
How do I look?

02:11.880 --> 02:13.160
Like a real star.

02:13.160 --> 02:13.990
There!

02:14.320 --> 02:15.360
Thanks.

02:15.480 --> 02:16.800
Well, hicks...

02:17.560 --> 02:19.310
A washed-up one...

02:21.440 --> 02:23.350
Hey... guys...

02:30.960 --> 02:33.030
Well now...I

02:33.320 --> 02:35.550
Hello you hicks!

02:38.000 --> 02:40.440
Yeah, sorry, I got a little... ha...

02:40.440 --> 02:43.430
Yeah, Kelmė, zdarova!

02:44.800 --> 02:46.630
Oh, Ukmergė...

02:49.040 --> 02:52.670
Anyway, here we are, and we've
got stuff up to here...

02:54.080 --> 02:57.840
And here's a new track
about fuckin' love...

03:11.320 --> 03:12.960
Come on...

03:24.800 --> 03:27.550
<i>It's very important how you feel</i>

03:27.760 --> 03:30.480
<i>Are you smiling at me, or at others too</i>

03:30.680 --> 03:33.720
<i>If you're smiling at me, I like it a lot</i>

03:36.560 --> 03:42.560
<i>No one refuses to touch
the golden ass anymore...</i>

03:42.920 --> 03:45.910
<i>...because I... I like it a lot</i>

03:48.240 --> 03:53.400
<i>I'm the sexiest and most talented of all</i>

03:53.720 --> 03:56.950
<i>I am the awesomest...</i>

03:57.160 --> 03:59.040
<i>Anyone have anything against that?</i>

03:59.240 --> 04:02.440
<i>I can sing</i>

04:02.440 --> 04:04.830
<i>I can see for myself, don't worry</i>

04:06.280 --> 04:07.920
<i>Don't annoy me</i>

04:08.520 --> 04:10.560
<i>Just don't annoy me</i>

04:10.800 --> 04:12.310
<i>Just don't start</i>

04:12.680 --> 04:16.120
<i>You know, I am amazing...</i>

04:17.680 --> 04:19.110
<i>Don't annoy me...</i>

04:20.920 --> 04:22.070
<i>Don't annoy me...</i>

04:51.840 --> 04:53.910
Get off the stage!

05:02.160 --> 05:03.360
Junk!

05:08.000 --> 05:09.200
Assholes!

05:09.480 --> 05:10.680
Shit!

05:12.000 --> 05:14.400
Fuck, assholes...

05:14.400 --> 05:16.000
Bastards, here I am... Here I'm trying...

05:16.000 --> 05:16.640
Punk...

05:16.640 --> 05:17.600
...like at least I'm doing
something, and what do they...

05:17.600 --> 05:19.520
...and they don't know shit.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.200
What did they expect, that
I'd go and la la la...

05:21.200 --> 05:21.710
Punk!

05:22.040 --> 05:24.080
Did you see that solo, how I rocked it...?

05:27.080 --> 05:28.200
Punk!

05:30.400 --> 05:31.200
Punk!

05:31.200 --> 05:31.840
What?

05:32.120 --> 05:33.800
Calm down, you hear?

05:33.800 --> 05:35.870
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah...

05:36.000 --> 05:37.440
Yeah, here we go...

05:37.440 --> 05:39.120
That's it, calm down, got it?

05:39.120 --> 05:40.440
Yeah, that's it...

05:40.440 --> 05:43.160
Yeah, that's it, I agree, that's it.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.880
From now on you're touring
on your own, without me.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.520
And that really is it, got it?

05:47.600 --> 05:49.800
Take it easy, what are you
getting all wound up about?

05:49.800 --> 05:51.600
Come on, it's not like we're
friends, talk normally.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.350
We were.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.600
What are you talking about?

05:54.600 --> 05:56.990
I'm sick of your crap,
everything has its limits.

05:57.480 --> 05:58.400
Got it?

05:58.400 --> 05:59.910
Just don't shit yourself, OK?

06:01.000 --> 06:04.840
Just do you really think that
anyone still cares about you?

06:08.520 --> 06:09.280
Listen...

06:09.280 --> 06:11.240
Listen, what, what do you want from me?

06:11.840 --> 06:13.560
What are you getting on my case for?

06:14.360 --> 06:15.870
What do you need?

06:16.560 --> 06:18.240
Oh, I hope I'm not intruding, perhaps
there's something I could get you?

06:18.240 --> 06:19.680
You're intruding. Nothing, thank you.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.640
Hold on, hold on...

06:20.640 --> 06:22.120
Gytis, what, are you, stupid?

06:22.120 --> 06:22.760
Hi.

06:22.760 --> 06:25.000
No, we definitely want to order something.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.720
Of course we'll order something.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.920
This, this is Gytis, my friend.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.760
My best friend.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.080
And this is...

06:32.080 --> 06:33.360
Kristina.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.240
Yeah, so Gytis and I will...
ahh, we'll order, right?

06:37.760 --> 06:39.680
Thanks, that's nice.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.960
He's really a good person just, you know,
he's in a bad mood right now...

06:42.960 --> 06:44.640
Listen, Kris...

06:44.640 --> 06:46.000
Ah, Kris, can I call you Kris?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.990
It just sounds more intimate, doesn't it?

06:48.760 --> 06:51.480
- Is there something you want?
- Oh, an autograph, yeah, of course...

06:51.800 --> 06:53.470
No, this is for work.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.310
Oh, so on your heart then, OK?

06:57.240 --> 06:59.760
Oh, I got a little there, Jesus, hold on...

07:01.240 --> 07:02.680
Oh... Sorry, I lost control...

07:02.680 --> 07:03.480
Gytis...

07:03.480 --> 07:05.680
Listen, why don't you
run over to the bar...

07:05.680 --> 07:09.120
...and bring us a bottle of Jack, Gytis and
I here have some stuff we need to disc...

07:09.120 --> 07:10.280
With ice?

07:10.280 --> 07:12.720
Yeah, of course with ice...

07:12.720 --> 07:15.040
You little ice cube of mine...

07:15.040 --> 07:17.030
Oh, you -go, go, go... quick...

07:26.800 --> 07:30.360
Oooh, I'll have her screaming
tonight, oy, screaming...

07:30.360 --> 07:32.030
I can share, don't worry.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.880
You know, do whatever you want.

07:35.880 --> 07:38.560
Screw, drink yourself into the ground.

07:38.560 --> 07:43.000
I'm sick of saving your neck, that's
all I've been doing for 12 years.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.350
Oh, so it's like that...

07:45.920 --> 07:49.230
You're like... you're just
going to up and go, right?

07:51.120 --> 07:53.680
Maybe you need an apology or something?

07:56.480 --> 07:58.840
You think you're the only
badass manager around here?

08:00.560 --> 08:04.440
Every single day I get calls up to here.

08:04.960 --> 08:06.520
I won't be lost without you, old man.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.720
I definitely won't be fucking lost.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.560
Get out of here.

08:11.160 --> 08:13.320
Why are you so quiet, don't you
have anything to say anymore?

08:13.320 --> 08:16.480
Right, of course, you're such a
badass manager and speaker...

08:16.480 --> 08:20.120
...when you go and arrange
these hick concerts, right?

08:20.120 --> 08:22.000
I get it...

08:23.320 --> 08:25.160
Yeah, well go ahead, there's the door.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.240
Go ahead, get out of here!

08:27.240 --> 08:30.320
You've got a concert in Gargždai
in two days, but without me.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.470
In shit!

08:32.200 --> 08:34.350
And I'll do just fine without you!

08:37.400 --> 08:39.200
Well get out of here, I don't need you!

08:43.400 --> 08:44.280
Fuck...

09:53.160 --> 09:54.720
Punk...

10:00.760 --> 10:02.670
Punk...

10:05.600 --> 10:07.350
Wake up...

10:12.200 --> 10:13.870
Get up...

10:15.600 --> 10:16.920
Hello...

10:23.160 --> 10:24.390
Hi.

10:25.560 --> 10:26.760
Hi.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.640
Wh... who... Who are you?

10:31.920 --> 10:33.880
And you're my dad.

10:37.440 --> 10:38.720
You're my dad.

10:38.720 --> 10:41.920
No, no, no, I'm not your dad.
You're my dad.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.920
So I'm your... I'm your... I'm your what?

11:01.840 --> 11:03.350
Dad.

11:11.240 --> 11:13.520
Hey, listen, get out of here, OK?

11:14.480 --> 11:16.400
I feel like crap.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.360
Get out of here.

11:18.360 --> 11:20.560
Well Momma said you're nice.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.840
I'm not nice at all, never have
been and never will be, alright...

11:24.840 --> 11:26.320
Get out of here.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.960
Listen, Greta, or whatever your name is...

11:29.960 --> 11:30.950
Gerda.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.000
Whatever.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.720
You know, I can just spell
it right out for you...

11:40.240 --> 11:44.440
Look, I'll give you an autograph.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.320
Here you go.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.240
Take it, take it.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.760
You can brag to your friends that
you saw me, that you talked to me, OK?

11:51.760 --> 11:53.830
- I don't need any autographs.
- Take it.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.630
So what do you want from me then, huh?

11:56.720 --> 11:59.200
I want to get to know my dad.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.600
So go ahead and get to know your dad.
What do I have to do with it?

12:01.600 --> 12:03.510
Because you are my dad.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.560
Listen - get out of here, now.

12:14.760 --> 12:15.990
Great...

12:21.920 --> 12:24.040
Fuck...

12:51.640 --> 12:53.640
Listen, little girl, who
do you think you are, huh?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.520
Maybe you shouldn't smoke around kids?

12:55.520 --> 12:56.400
What do you want from me, huh?

12:56.400 --> 12:57.800
You want me to buy you some candy?

12:57.800 --> 12:59.440
What does candy have to do with it?

12:59.440 --> 13:00.600
What do I have to do with it?

13:00.600 --> 13:01.560
In general, what do...

13:01.560 --> 13:02.800
You're my dad.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.160
Listen, get out of here.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.720
If you think I'm going to be your
babysitter, you're very wrong.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.950
Go home! Home!

13:09.680 --> 13:13.990
You know, actually, my home is
far away, in Šilutė District.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.880
Where?

13:15.880 --> 13:17.200
Šilut...

13:17.200 --> 13:19.280
You want to say you're here all alone?

13:19.280 --> 13:21.160
Well, yeah, so?

13:21.160 --> 13:22.880
So, so, ho ho.

13:24.440 --> 13:28.150
Really, Momma let me come see your concert.

13:28.760 --> 13:31.760
Oh, Momma let you come see a concert?

13:31.760 --> 13:33.720
How old are you, five?

13:33.720 --> 13:35.640
Eight.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.240
Oh, well yeah, so then it's possible...

13:37.240 --> 13:42.360
...yeah, that Momma let her little girl come from
the other side of Lithuania to see my concert.

13:42.360 --> 13:43.640
Well, yeah, that makes sense.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.630
It's possible, why not.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.840
Loook... look...

13:48.840 --> 13:49.720
What?

13:49.720 --> 13:53.320
A little bird. See, it's so small.
On the tree, see it?

13:53.320 --> 13:54.120
Where?

13:54.120 --> 13:55.880
Don't scare it. Quiet. Look,
high up, by the tree...

13:55.880 --> 13:57.520
I don't see it...

14:22.000 --> 14:24.280
This is some kind of nightmare...

14:37.960 --> 14:39.360
I don't get it...

14:39.360 --> 14:40.880
What are you doing here?

14:40.880 --> 14:42.040
Sitting.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.040
I can see that you're not standing.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.760
Just get out of the car already.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.200
What is this, get out...

14:47.200 --> 14:49.240
Now, get out, get out of here...

14:49.240 --> 14:50.590
I'm not going anywhere.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.400
Oh, well OK then, let's call the police.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.880
What are you going to call with, your hand?

14:58.880 --> 15:01.920
People... Peo, help, police!

15:01.920 --> 15:02.720
Hello!

15:04.040 --> 15:06.680
If you scream, I'll say
you were harassing me.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.960
Oh, so you're threatening me now?

15:09.960 --> 15:12.720
No, I'm just warning you.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.790
No, well you're a terrorist.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.320
Well fine, hey... yeah,
let's go call your...

15:18.320 --> 15:21.160
...your mommy, momma or whatever.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.320
There, a pay phone. We'll
just go over there, call her.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.640
...and figure everything out.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.480
My momma doesn't have a phone.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.520
What do you mean she doesn't have a phone?

15:27.520 --> 15:28.640
Everyone has a phone.

15:28.640 --> 15:31.120
Every little old lady in
the village has a phone.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.920
Well Momma doesn't.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.070
What are you talking about?

15:35.960 --> 15:37.400
Well fine then, we'll call your dad.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.960
Then, well then, then fine, then your
grandma or grandpa. Do you have one?

15:44.960 --> 15:48.110
No, I don't have a grandma or grandpa.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.870
You don't have... OK, then
brothers, or sisters...

15:53.360 --> 15:54.200
No?

15:54.200 --> 15:56.160
So, hold on, so you...

15:56.160 --> 16:00.360
Do you at least have... well...
do you have anyone?

16:00.360 --> 16:02.520
Like at least one friend...

16:02.520 --> 16:04.280
I do, here.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.190
What, that's bullshit, he's not real.

16:06.480 --> 16:10.360
Well, actually... I kind
of also have Momma.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.080
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah...

16:13.080 --> 16:15.440
Well actually that momma
of yours isn't normal.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.600
Listen, so hold on... So you've
been here since yesterday?

16:19.600 --> 16:21.590
So that means an entire day.

16:22.280 --> 16:25.320
Well I can guarantee they're already looking
for you or already started looking...

16:25.320 --> 16:26.720
...probably with the police.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.920
They're not looking for me.

16:29.920 --> 16:33.310
I'm not the most important
thing in her life.

16:34.440 --> 16:37.160
What do you mean you're not
the most important thing?

16:37.160 --> 16:38.510
How can a mother not care?

16:39.720 --> 16:41.320
Well...

16:41.320 --> 16:44.920
She drinks...

16:44.920 --> 16:47.640
...and lately-a lot.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.760
Well, God, I mean, we all drink...

16:50.760 --> 16:52.920
I also have a drink once in a while.

16:52.920 --> 16:54.880
One or two shot here and there.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.840
God, it happens, but this...

17:04.000 --> 17:05.430
Crap, this is ridiculous.

17:09.119 --> 17:12.000
Listen, where did you say you're from?

17:12.000 --> 17:15.150
From, from, Telšiai, or that Šilut...
Šilutė?

17:15.599 --> 17:18.200
Well almost-from Saugos.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.680
OK, we'll think of something.
Just don't you worry.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.990
We'll get out of this somehow.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.839
Do you at least want to eat?

17:27.839 --> 17:30.240
Yeah, that wouldn't be bad.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.360
Right?

17:31.360 --> 17:35.320
OK... we can go and we'll find something...
we'll get something to eat.

17:35.320 --> 17:38.040
Because I, for one, could
go for a shitburger.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.200
Yeah...

17:45.080 --> 17:46.560
Well yeah...

17:49.320 --> 17:52.520
Not good, not good.

17:52.520 --> 17:55.080
Of course, the concert
was free last night...

17:55.800 --> 17:57.720
You obviously don't have
anything either, right?

18:03.600 --> 18:05.080
Here, we'll take this.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.280
Watch.

18:08.360 --> 18:09.720
Hold this for a second.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.080
Thanks.

18:11.080 --> 18:13.360
I hope you're not planning
on selling your guitar?

18:13.360 --> 18:14.720
Me? What, are you kidding?

18:14.720 --> 18:16.720
For me to sell it...

18:16.720 --> 18:18.400
My mom gave this to me.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.870
And I came up with so many hits on it.

18:21.720 --> 18:22.840
You'll see.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.830
Come on, let's go.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.150
What are you doing?

18:37.280 --> 18:41.240
I happen to be ultra-popular...

18:41.240 --> 18:43.280
...and everyone knows me here.

18:43.280 --> 18:46.440
It would be really uncool if
anyone recognized me when...

18:46.440 --> 18:54.200
...when I play on the street for a few
minutes and we collect so much money, kid...

18:55.800 --> 18:58.320
...that we can eat this much.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.440
Get back a little, go over
there, sit on that bench.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.920
Don't embarrass me.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.310
Yeah...

19:12.360 --> 19:14.640
<i>There on the hill, where the goats graze</i>

19:14.640 --> 19:17.640
<i>Kaldi baldi kaldi balda</i>

19:17.640 --> 19:21.320
<i>And we were attacked by crabs</i>

19:21.320 --> 19:23.550
<i>Kaldi baldi kaldi balda</i>

19:27.960 --> 19:30.800
<i>An old cannon is not artillery</i>

19:30.800 --> 19:33.320
<i>Kaldi baldi kaldi balda</i>

19:33.320 --> 19:36.840
<i>Hurting a girl is not a miracle</i>

19:36.840 --> 19:38.750
<i>Kaldi baldi kaldi...</i>

19:39.640 --> 19:41.360
What's so funny?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.800
Punk, you know, I'm embarrassed for you.

19:46.120 --> 19:49.640
I don't care what you think, kid.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.480
You sit right there, quietly.

19:51.480 --> 19:52.680
Sit, sit, sit...

19:52.680 --> 19:54.720
...and watch how the pros do it.

19:57.840 --> 19:58.830
Ok.

20:01.120 --> 20:04.360
<i>You can't cut bread with a fork</i>

20:04.360 --> 20:07.480
<i>Kaldi baldi kaldi balda</i>

20:07.480 --> 20:10.000
<i>You can't shit in someone else's pants...</i>

20:10.400 --> 20:12.960
...finished school but never had a job.

20:12.960 --> 20:13.920
And you know?

20:13.920 --> 20:17.910
I know, I checked it out and
didn't find anything, you know...

20:20.680 --> 20:23.280
Oh, look, that's that musician.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.200
You call him a musician...

20:25.200 --> 20:28.080
Punk, with that "hey, redneck
with the black leather jacket"...

20:28.080 --> 20:31.600
No, come on, he's just some
bum who's high on something.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.680
I'm telling you.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.760
Punk's a star, I saw him on TV.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.560
Well, a while ago, but still...

20:36.560 --> 20:37.800
I'll bet you.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.760
Yeah? What for?

20:39.760 --> 20:42.510
New Year's, if I win, you're on duty.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.110
OK.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.440
Ah, we'll find something
to hassle him about?

20:47.440 --> 20:48.680
What, like it's the first time?

20:52.560 --> 20:55.840
I'm officer Julius Sičiūnas, and
this is my colleague Algis Žinys

20:55.840 --> 20:56.680
Hello.

20:56.680 --> 20:57.640
What are we doing here?

20:57.640 --> 20:59.320
I'm playing.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.720
Did you know it's prohibited to
make noise in a public place?

21:01.920 --> 21:03.440
I'm not making noise, I'm just...

21:03.440 --> 21:09.000
The fine for making noise in a public
place is from 50 to 250 litas.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.840
Guys, you've got to be kidding.

21:10.840 --> 21:13.160
I'm just, I mean, people...

21:13.160 --> 21:14.120
What people?

21:14.120 --> 21:15.560
Come on now...

21:15.560 --> 21:17.600
I mean, I'm just playing, so what?

21:17.600 --> 21:19.600
What, I can't play here,
it's a free country.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.080
Do you have ID?

21:21.080 --> 21:24.160
Let's see, I should have it, but wait...

21:24.160 --> 21:25.280
Let's go down to the station.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.400
Wait, wait... guys, guys...

21:28.600 --> 21:29.510
Huh?

21:30.360 --> 21:31.110
I'm Punk.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.280
<i>Hey, redneck with the black leather jacket</i>

21:33.280 --> 21:34.480
Well and so what if you're Punk.

21:34.480 --> 21:35.520
We're musicians too.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.680
He's a rapper, and I do metal.

21:37.680 --> 21:38.800
And a hippie too.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.920
No, guys. I'm a popular musician.
You really don't know me?

21:42.160 --> 21:45.440
I'm really, really popular, like...

21:45.440 --> 21:46.960
Let's go, we'll talk there.

21:46.960 --> 21:47.440
Guys, wait...

21:47.441 --> 21:48.721
Let him go.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.840
It's not his fault, it's mine.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.000
Gerda, don't butt in, OK?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.840
And why can't I?

21:54.840 --> 21:58.560
I don't want them to put my daddy in jail.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.400
Alright, alright, don't cry now.
No one's going to put him in jail.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.520
Yeah...

22:02.520 --> 22:03.520
Alright, that's it.

22:03.520 --> 22:04.320
This is your dad?

22:04.320 --> 22:05.280
A warning.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.280
Yes, this is my dad.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.760
OK, OK... No problems, thank you.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.150
Thank you, guys, have a nice day.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.160
Look, there's this thing...

22:14.160 --> 22:17.150
My daughter-she's a huge fan of yours...

22:17.840 --> 22:18.720
Huge.

22:18.720 --> 22:21.760
Maybe you could just
write something for her?

22:21.760 --> 22:24.120
No problem, chief.

22:24.120 --> 22:25.440
What's your daughter's name?

22:25.440 --> 22:26.240
Jurgita.

22:26.240 --> 22:27.440
Jurgita, right?

22:27.440 --> 22:30.000
Jurgita Žinytė. She's
graduating this year...

22:30.000 --> 22:33.600
...and she really wants to get on one
of those TV shows, try something out.

22:33.600 --> 22:36.120
Oh, no problem. I know everyone there.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.680
We'll work something out, of course.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.640
Alright... So she can go and
talk to you, after the concert?

22:39.640 --> 22:40.880
Of course, tell her, that...

22:40.880 --> 22:43.200
Well, we'll take care of it.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.200
Here you go.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.640
Thanks, thanks so much,
you'll make her happy.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.040
Great, aha. See you.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.800
Thank you so much.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.200
See you.

22:52.880 --> 22:54.230
I almost shitted my pants.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.680
Well you did a great job with that...

22:58.680 --> 23:00.350
Actually, I wasn't lying.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.520
OK, OK, just don't start
all over with that now.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.880
Everything panned out, so thank God.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.240
Well, let's wrap it up, this
place isn't going to work.

23:08.240 --> 23:09.520
Hold on, Punk.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.160
Don't give up hope, huh.

23:11.160 --> 23:12.920
Wanna try together?

23:12.920 --> 23:14.240
What together?

23:14.240 --> 23:16.920
Well, you can play and I'll sing.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.840
Momma said that I have a pretty good voice.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.560
I got it from my dad.

23:21.560 --> 23:23.840
How many times have I told
you not to call me dad, huh?

23:23.840 --> 23:28.160
I didn't say from you, I said from my dad.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.760
Well, you, you're being fresh again.

23:30.760 --> 23:34.120
Well OK, let's give it a try.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.360
Do you know Seven-Spotted Ladybug?

23:36.360 --> 23:38.440
<i>Seven-spotted ladybug...</i>

23:38.440 --> 23:39.320
Huh?

23:39.320 --> 23:40.480
Don't make me laugh, alright?

23:40.480 --> 23:41.680
What, so then Day-Dreamer?

23:41.680 --> 23:45.040
<i>Oh, day-dreamer, my dear...</i>

23:45.040 --> 23:46.080
Cut it out.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.520
You have good songs of your own.

23:48.520 --> 23:51.120
So play one of them.

23:51.120 --> 23:54.000
Really? What, so you know, like...

23:54.800 --> 23:56.950
I know them all.

23:58.040 --> 23:59.040
Really?

23:59.040 --> 24:00.360
Well, fine...

24:01.600 --> 24:03.440
Do you know this one, look...

24:03.440 --> 24:04.320
Oh, just a sec.

24:04.320 --> 24:07.320
Ah, no, no, let's do it like this.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.760
I can't... I mean, I can't do it with you.

24:09.760 --> 24:11.280
I'm used to being alone, on stage.

24:11.280 --> 24:14.280
And I always sing, you see?

24:14.280 --> 24:17.520
Why don't you just walk around here...

24:17.520 --> 24:21.000
...move around, stir things up,
wave your arms or something, OK?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.120
I'll sing, and you can dance.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.200
Do you know how to dance?

24:24.200 --> 24:25.360
Of course I do.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.560
Well good then. Dance,
and I'll give it a try.

24:27.560 --> 24:28.440
Alright.

24:28.440 --> 24:29.800
Alright?

24:29.800 --> 24:30.550
OK.

24:31.880 --> 24:35.440
<i>Yes, you see a bright light, yes...</i>

24:35.440 --> 24:36.360
You know that song?

24:36.360 --> 24:36.950
Yes

24:39.520 --> 24:41.280
<i>...you have a sensitive soul, yes...</i>

24:41.280 --> 24:42.280
Well, come on, dance.

24:42.280 --> 24:44.560
<i>...you have dum dum dum...</i>

24:45.480 --> 24:47.280
<i>If I don't let you fly, if you want...</i>

24:47.280 --> 24:48.360
Good, yeah!

24:48.360 --> 24:50.480
<i>...to hug you...</i>

24:50.480 --> 24:52.640
<i>...you are the most...</i>

24:52.640 --> 24:54.440
Where did you learn to
dance like that, huh?

24:54.440 --> 24:55.270
Momma taught me.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.560
Oh yeah?

24:57.960 --> 24:59.470
Wow!

25:00.560 --> 25:01.550
OK...

25:08.240 --> 25:14.440
<i>Butterflies are free and made to fly</i>

25:14.440 --> 25:20.560
<i>If they land on you, just don't
press them in your hand...</i>

25:20.560 --> 25:26.640
<i>You are free, so fly as far as you can</i>

25:26.640 --> 25:33.280
<i>And tell me about what
you see when you fly...</i>

25:33.280 --> 25:39.040
<i>If your worlds seem strange and cruel...</i>

25:39.040 --> 25:45.040
<i>...lift your eyes to the heavens and
leave your thoughts outside the window</i>

25:45.040 --> 25:51.040
<i>You can come and go, you
can never come back...</i>

25:51.040 --> 25:57.360
<i>...but I would like more than anything
to feel your wing on my hand...</i>

26:09.600 --> 26:15.600
<i>Butterflies are free and made to fly</i>

26:15.600 --> 26:21.520
<i>If they land on you, just don't
press them in your hand...</i>

26:21.520 --> 26:27.600
<i>You are free, so fly as far as you can</i>

26:27.600 --> 26:33.720
<i>And tell me about what
you see when you fly...</i>

26:33.720 --> 26:39.680
<i>Butterflies are free and made to fly</i>

26:39.680 --> 26:45.600
<i>If they land on you, just don't
press them in your hand...</i>

26:45.600 --> 26:52.080
<i>You are free, so fly as far as you can</i>

26:52.080 --> 26:58.400
<i>And tell me about what
you see when you fly...</i>

26:58.400 --> 27:04.640
<i>Butterflies are free and made to fly</i>

27:04.640 --> 27:10.480
<i>If they land on you, just don't
press them in your hand...</i>

27:10.480 --> 27:16.920
<i>You are free, so fly as far as you can</i>

27:16.920 --> 27:24.430
<i>And tell me about what
you see when you fly...</i>

27:26.320 --> 27:27.520
Well there you go.

27:27.520 --> 27:29.480
And you get a sparkle in
your eyes, don't you?

27:32.720 --> 27:35.640
Hey, listen, that was a good idea you
had with that dancing, wasn't it?

27:35.640 --> 27:40.510
Well, I don't like to brag, but
in my opinion, I'm a good dancer.

27:41.720 --> 27:44.030
In my opinion, you confidence
level is also pretty good.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.760
Why didn't you turn me over to the police?

27:48.760 --> 27:49.680
What?

27:49.680 --> 27:51.600
I mean, you want to get rid of me.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.040
Why didn't you?

27:53.040 --> 27:54.960
I don't know, just because...

27:54.960 --> 27:57.520
I guess I could have.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.360
I didn't have time.

27:59.360 --> 28:01.360
They just appeared with all
those signatures of theirs.

28:01.360 --> 28:03.000
I could hardly manage.

28:04.960 --> 28:08.030
Well I think you like me.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.080
I don't like you at all.

28:13.560 --> 28:14.990
You see...

28:15.960 --> 28:18.960
When I saw you lying to those policemen...

28:18.960 --> 28:20.800
it was great!

28:20.800 --> 28:22.800
You were born to be an actor.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.320
Well, you know...

28:24.320 --> 28:26.360
I'm actually learning from you.

28:27.280 --> 28:29.480
Where did you learn to lie like that, huh?

28:30.480 --> 28:35.000
When a person who's important
to you gets into trouble...

28:35.000 --> 28:37.440
...and you have to get him out of it...

28:37.440 --> 28:40.190
...you can lie a little.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.400
But wait...

28:42.400 --> 28:45.360
So you want to say that we, are
now important to one another?

28:45.360 --> 28:46.320
Mhm.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.560
You understood correctly.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.360
No, no, no...

28:51.880 --> 28:53.720
No, I understood it completely differently.

28:53.720 --> 28:55.760
Everything is a lot more simple.

28:55.760 --> 28:57.560
Maybe it's important to you.

28:57.560 --> 29:01.840
Maybe you've come up with some ridiculous
genealogical tree or something.

29:02.760 --> 29:07.920
But for me the most important thing is
to get you back to your mom somehow.

29:09.480 --> 29:12.000
And then we're going to say a nice goodbye.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.560
Shake each other's hands.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.400
And like wave to each other...

29:18.400 --> 29:20.310
it's all simple.

29:21.240 --> 29:22.080
Listen...

29:22.080 --> 29:24.880
Tomorrow I have a concert in Gargždai.

29:24.880 --> 29:27.030
That's not far, right? Yeah?

29:29.080 --> 29:30.360
It's on the way.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.120
So I'll take you there.

29:33.120 --> 29:35.520
So look, one more thing, by the way.

29:35.520 --> 29:38.280
In my car, you know, if you come with me...

29:38.280 --> 29:40.960
There's three very important rules:

29:40.960 --> 29:43.160
You don't call me dad.

29:43.160 --> 29:43.960
Right?

29:43.960 --> 29:45.480
Rule two:

29:45.480 --> 29:47.440
You're not going to whine the whole way.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.800
You're not going to ask stupid questions.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.560
And you're not going to fuss around.

29:51.560 --> 29:52.880
And third:

29:52.880 --> 29:54.600
This is the main one.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.120
You're not going to call me dad, got it?

29:56.120 --> 29:57.160
OK, Dad.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.560
Oh, you...

29:58.560 --> 30:00.200
Calm down, everything's fine...

30:00.200 --> 30:01.200
What are you getting all riled up about?

30:01.200 --> 30:03.110
OK, are you done?

30:04.080 --> 30:04.880
Take that.

30:05.680 --> 30:06.760
Give it to me.

30:06.760 --> 30:08.160
What is it?

30:08.160 --> 30:10.200
Juice.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.960
Are you going to make up
your mind or what Gerda?

31:12.400 --> 31:15.310
Well I, for one, don't like that
they're playing stupid stuff.

31:17.760 --> 31:20.320
How can you like if it you
don't even have time to...

31:20.320 --> 31:22.960
I, for one, don't hear one word and
immediately change the station.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.150
Just leave one, pick one out.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.040
Yeah, leave this, that's a good one.

31:31.040 --> 31:31.950
Huh?

31:36.280 --> 31:38.320
Well some taste you have.

31:38.320 --> 31:39.830
What? That's an awesome track.

31:40.680 --> 31:43.200
Whatever. I'll leave it.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.830
It's definitely better than the one before.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.680
<i>Radio Lietus Top 20.</i>

31:49.680 --> 31:51.080
<i>Dear listeners...</i>

31:51.080 --> 31:54.640
<i>...it's my pleasure to remind you that I'm about
to give away the last tickets to a concert...</i>

31:54.640 --> 31:57.040
<i>...that all of Lithuania
is going nuts over.</i>

31:57.040 --> 31:59.440
<i>Without a doubt, I am
speaking about Marijonas.</i>

31:59.440 --> 32:02.560
<i>You have to agree that Marijonas is
really the rock discovery of the year.</i>

32:02.560 --> 32:04.160
They call that a discovery...

32:04.160 --> 32:06.880
<i>Marijonas just happens to be touring
Lithuania's biggest cities right now...</i>

32:06.880 --> 32:09.120
<i>...and is inviting you to
come and listen to his songs.</i>

32:09.120 --> 32:11.960
<i>By the way, we've been informed that...</i>

32:11.960 --> 32:13.920
<i>...tickets to see the charismatic
Marijonas in concert are almost sold out.</i>

32:13.920 --> 32:18.480
<i>But you, my dear Radio Lietus listeners, have a chance
to see his concert by calling in to our game show...</i>

32:18.480 --> 32:20.880
<i>...where you will be able to
win tickets, just like that.</i>

32:20.880 --> 32:22.880
Oh, big deal, they wouldn't
go even if they paid them.

32:22.880 --> 32:25.480
<i>And now a song which has been in first place on the
Radio Lietus Top 20 charts for 10 weeks already.</i>

32:25.480 --> 32:28.400
<i>It is one of the most played
songs on our radio station.</i>

32:28.400 --> 32:32.390
<i>So enjoy-Marijonas and his
super hit "What Can I Do".</i>

32:42.280 --> 32:44.000
Hey, leave it, it's a good song!

32:44.000 --> 32:46.960
She likes the song...

32:46.960 --> 32:49.950
This shit, he's old. How can you like him?

32:57.080 --> 32:59.040
So you even know the words?

32:59.040 --> 33:01.720
Of course. Who doesn't know this song?

33:01.720 --> 33:03.280
It's a real hit.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.240
You think it's a hit, I'll...

33:05.240 --> 33:07.480
No, not in my car...

33:07.480 --> 33:09.280
I'm not gonna have this in my car.

33:09.280 --> 33:11.080
- Leave it!
- Turn it off, please!

33:11.080 --> 33:12.320
Is this my car or your car?

33:12.320 --> 33:13.750
I'm telling you, move your hand.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.440
Can you see that I'm driving?

33:16.440 --> 33:17.480
I won't let you...

33:17.480 --> 33:18.840
You'll frickin' get out of the car!

33:19.800 --> 33:21.200
Let me listen...

33:21.200 --> 33:22.240
Turn it off!

33:27.640 --> 33:29.440
Frickin' A... Gerda... Are you OK?

33:29.440 --> 33:30.840
Yes, I'm fine.

33:30.840 --> 33:31.800
How are you?

33:32.520 --> 33:34.000
I'm fine, everything's OK.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.560
Really? Somehow I don't believe you.

33:35.560 --> 33:36.910
Yeah. Fine, everything's fine.

33:45.040 --> 33:46.470
Why did you do that?

33:49.840 --> 33:50.560
Alright...

33:52.000 --> 33:54.200
Well, let's try to get this
thing going somehow, right?

33:57.280 --> 33:58.510
What's this?

34:03.920 --> 34:06.160
Now we're in trouble...

34:06.160 --> 34:09.040
We're going to have to get out of the car.

34:09.040 --> 34:10.239
It doesn't open.

34:10.639 --> 34:11.800
What doesn't open?

34:11.800 --> 34:14.159
It always opens.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.040
It doesn't open.

34:16.040 --> 34:18.190
Something's stuck, hold on, I'll open it

34:26.440 --> 34:28.400
Now what could it be...

34:30.480 --> 34:31.389
Yeah...

34:36.040 --> 34:38.400
What the... maybe it's rusted...

34:39.120 --> 34:40.520
You wanted to open the hood?

34:40.520 --> 34:41.960
Oh, yeah, I thought, I'd forgotten...

34:41.960 --> 34:43.520
Get out of the way now.

34:43.520 --> 34:45.400
Yeah, let the pros work.

34:45.400 --> 34:46.150
Aha.

34:47.600 --> 34:50.719
Right, what could it be?

34:54.040 --> 34:55.790
What is this?

34:57.880 --> 34:59.280
No, everything here's fine.

34:59.280 --> 35:02.000
Maybe the compression's low or something?

35:03.280 --> 35:04.430
But it seems...

35:13.440 --> 35:14.440
You hear?

35:14.440 --> 35:16.200
Get the wrenches from the trunk.

35:16.200 --> 35:19.830
Maybe it's the U-joint or something...

35:21.200 --> 35:24.720
Aha, focus, focus, focus, focus...

35:26.040 --> 35:28.110
Jeez, you went to voc-tech,
you're a frickin' auto mechanic...

35:28.440 --> 35:30.240
No, this is ridiculous...

35:31.200 --> 35:32.680
Gerda, you hear?

35:36.360 --> 35:38.030
There, maybe it's this hose.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.640
Well yeah, we don't need this here.

35:40.640 --> 35:41.920
Gerda!

35:42.880 --> 35:44.280
Frickin' A, how long are you...

35:44.280 --> 35:45.270
Where are you?

35:52.480 --> 35:54.600
What, are we playing hide-and-seek now?

35:55.160 --> 35:56.640
Come on, come out.

35:57.800 --> 35:58.950
Gerda!

36:01.120 --> 36:02.190
I give up.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.200
No, we have a lot of time,
I mean, actually I...

36:07.200 --> 36:08.350
Some sort of mystery.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.280
Well, well, get over here!

37:48.280 --> 37:49.280
Oh, you rock.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.880
Do you have a tow rope?

37:50.880 --> 37:52.520
Not me, I smoked the last one...

37:52.520 --> 37:53.920
No, I already had a smoke.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.040
Do you have a tow rope?

37:55.040 --> 37:56.710
Ah, that, no, I don't, I don't.

37:57.720 --> 37:59.800
Oh, hold on, I have chains,
everything's fine.

37:59.800 --> 38:00.560
Just a second.

38:00.560 --> 38:01.440
Aha, thanks.

38:01.440 --> 38:04.110
So where did you get
that tractor from, huh?

38:04.480 --> 38:06.360
Well, I saw the tractor.

38:06.360 --> 38:08.320
So I went to ask for help.

38:08.320 --> 38:10.200
Well and he agreed.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.240
We came, and I asked.

38:12.240 --> 38:13.600
So it's all very simple.

38:13.600 --> 38:14.600
Oh, so you think this is simple?

38:14.600 --> 38:15.560
And what's so difficult about it?

38:15.560 --> 38:16.720
Well what are you standing there for?

38:16.720 --> 38:17.720
Get inside!

38:17.720 --> 38:19.000
It's not going to steer itself.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.880
And close the hood, you'll drive it out.

38:38.560 --> 38:40.870
Well, then, how much do I owe you?

38:41.840 --> 38:44.830
Stop horsing around, like you owe me.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.390
Buy your daughter some candy.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.880
Well thank you very much then.

38:49.880 --> 38:53.480
You know what's better than
a big, big, big thank you?

38:53.760 --> 38:55.910
A little, little, little 0.7l bottle.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.080
Come on, I'm kidding, bye!

38:58.080 --> 38:59.320
OK, bye then.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.880
Yeah, thanks.

39:04.320 --> 39:05.070
Well...

39:06.880 --> 39:08.390
Get in the car, let's go.

39:11.120 --> 39:12.270
Put on your seat belt.

39:52.160 --> 39:55.120
Listen, it's my last cigarette!

39:56.400 --> 39:58.920
Hey, that was so delicious!

39:58.920 --> 40:01.120
Yeah, delicious! My cigarette
was delicious too...

40:21.120 --> 40:22.320
Enjoy.

40:34.200 --> 40:35.710
You've got a spider on your head.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.320
There, in back, in back...

40:38.320 --> 40:41.400
- Where, get rid of it, get rid of it...
- I can't reach...

40:41.400 --> 40:42.720
- Where?
- There?

40:42.720 --> 40:44.200
So get it if you can!

40:46.560 --> 40:47.520
Where? So get it!

40:47.520 --> 40:48.270
Gerda!

41:35.680 --> 41:38.280
Well, so this is where I live.

41:39.520 --> 41:41.080
Wow.

41:42.120 --> 41:43.710
So what, you have Wi-Fi?

41:44.640 --> 41:46.150
Come on, what Wi-Fi?

41:47.400 --> 41:48.640
Well then...

41:48.640 --> 41:51.390
if you don't have Wi-Fi,
then give me a high-five.

41:52.480 --> 41:53.360
And good bye!

41:54.440 --> 41:56.400
Run to your momma, so to speak.

41:56.400 --> 41:58.150
I'm off to see mine.

42:02.040 --> 42:03.550
Thanks for the ride.

42:04.320 --> 42:05.440
Ah, no biggie.

42:07.800 --> 42:09.600
Well, so see you.

42:09.600 --> 42:10.750
See you.

42:12.280 --> 42:15.350
Go on, your mom's probably
waiting for you with a belt.

42:15.800 --> 42:19.000
She's not waiting... She's not home.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.990
- How do you know that?
- The light's not on.

42:22.720 --> 42:25.600
- Oh, so you live somewhere around here, right?
- Yeah, yeah...

42:25.920 --> 42:27.830
So what are you going to do now?

42:28.160 --> 42:29.800
It's no big deal.

42:32.760 --> 42:34.800
I'll sleep in the stairwell.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.640
It's cold outside.

42:36.640 --> 42:38.120
What, are you kidding?

42:38.840 --> 42:41.560
No... it's not the first time.

42:41.760 --> 42:45.280
Now hold on, maybe she just ran out
somewhere and will be right back...

42:46.240 --> 42:47.760
Maybe.

42:47.760 --> 42:49.320
Who knows...

42:50.840 --> 42:54.120
Maybe she'll come back, maybe she won't.
Well, you know, you never know.

42:54.600 --> 42:57.350
Now wait, you mean, like
sometimes she doesn't come back?

42:58.120 --> 43:00.480
Well yeah, there've been
all kinds of situations.

43:01.480 --> 43:03.630
Well that's some momma you have there.

43:11.320 --> 43:13.120
Look, let's do it like this. Alright?

43:14.200 --> 43:16.590
We'll go to my mom's. She
doesn't live far from here.

43:17.360 --> 43:18.560
And we'll spend the night there.

43:18.560 --> 43:20.760
And then tomorrow morning
I'll bring you back here.

43:20.760 --> 43:22.200
And maybe she'll already be back.

43:22.200 --> 43:22.840
OK?

43:23.480 --> 43:24.600
OK.

43:25.440 --> 43:26.190
Alright.

43:26.560 --> 43:27.840
Oh, right...

43:27.840 --> 43:30.440
And when we get there,
there's another rule:

43:30.440 --> 43:33.760
Don't go and try to call her grandma,
because she'll have a heart attack.

43:33.760 --> 43:34.800
Got it? Huh?

43:35.640 --> 43:37.600
I'm asking you if you got it.

43:37.600 --> 43:38.880
Got it, got it...

43:38.880 --> 43:40.280
Well you watch it.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.280
Alright...

44:25.120 --> 44:26.080
What the...

44:36.920 --> 44:38.200
You didn't forget the rule?

44:38.200 --> 44:40.120
No, no...

44:40.120 --> 44:41.470
Well you watch it.

44:44.240 --> 44:45.320
Hi, Mom.

44:45.320 --> 44:46.760
You weren't expecting me, huh?

44:46.760 --> 44:48.880
Jesus... What are you
doing here so late, huh?

44:48.880 --> 44:50.560
Oh, you know, I was just in the area.

44:50.560 --> 44:51.400
Hi, hi.

44:51.400 --> 44:53.400
Oy, hi, hi, Laimutis.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.600
You've gotten so thin, listen,
you haven't been eating.

44:55.600 --> 44:57.480
I eat, I eat, Mom. Everything's fine.

44:57.480 --> 44:58.240
Wow.

44:58.240 --> 45:00.280
This is Gerda.

45:00.800 --> 45:01.550
What...

45:02.120 --> 45:03.280
She's Gytis' daughter.

45:03.280 --> 45:04.360
- Gytis?
- Yeah...

45:04.360 --> 45:05.960
- Your Gytis?
- Well yeah.

45:05.960 --> 45:09.480
- What? How?
- Oh, it's a long story, you know...

45:09.880 --> 45:12.870
- Hi Gerda, hello, how old are you?
- Eight.

45:15.080 --> 45:17.910
So what are you doing out so late, huh?

45:20.520 --> 45:25.880
- Gargždai? And you're going to Gargždai too?
- No, no, she...

45:25.880 --> 45:29.520
- Gytis asked me to take her to her grandmother's...
- I see, I see.

45:29.520 --> 45:31.960
Let's go inside, it's getting cool out.

45:31.960 --> 45:34.270
We'll make dinner, alright?

45:35.240 --> 45:36.470
Sit down, Gerda.

45:38.960 --> 45:42.000
Oh, Mom, you know, you've got to do
something with the kitchen, huh?

45:42.000 --> 45:45.910
Oh, child, and who's going to do it,
you know yourself there's no one.

45:49.040 --> 45:50.870
So you say she's Gytis'.

45:51.760 --> 45:55.640
And you used to come together,
it used to be so much fun...

45:56.240 --> 45:58.000
Well, you know.

45:58.000 --> 46:02.150
This time he couldn't, he had
some business to take care of.

46:02.520 --> 46:03.720
I understand.

46:04.160 --> 46:08.520
So this time I'm going
to the concert alone.

46:08.520 --> 46:11.600
Oh, Laimutis, why are you eating like that?

46:11.600 --> 46:13.440
I'll make you some soup.

46:13.440 --> 46:15.240
Mom, we're so hungry.

46:15.240 --> 46:17.390
You know, after the trip.

46:19.760 --> 46:23.280
But how could I not have known that
Gytis has such an adorable girl?

46:25.480 --> 46:27.710
So how's that dad of your doing, hm?

46:28.480 --> 46:29.400
Gerda, let's go.

46:29.400 --> 46:32.280
Mom, we're going into the
living room to rest.

46:32.280 --> 46:34.880
You know, we're tired. We'll sit
down like normal people, right?

46:34.880 --> 46:37.240
OK, fine, go ahead.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.440
<i>Yesterday a girl disappeared
from the Šilutė orphanage..</i>

46:48.960 --> 46:49.920
Why did you turn it off?

46:51.200 --> 46:52.920
There's just garbage on.

46:55.200 --> 46:57.000
So, Laimutis?

46:58.880 --> 47:00.520
Now we have another rule:

47:00.520 --> 47:02.880
You don't call me Laimutis, got it?

47:03.800 --> 47:06.040
So listen, how's that Gytis doing?

47:06.040 --> 47:08.920
I find it all so interesting, so
interesting. Tell me about it.

47:09.240 --> 47:11.720
Not bad, he's doing really good.

47:11.720 --> 47:13.600
He's happy, everything's fine.

47:13.600 --> 47:19.080
So if everything's fine, why couldn't he bring
his daughter to see her grandma himself?

47:19.080 --> 47:23.230
I told you-he's busy. I mean, he
couldn't... He didn't have time.

47:24.560 --> 47:27.230
So why are you Punk if
you're really Laimutis?

47:28.520 --> 47:30.800
Because my parents didn't
know what they were doing.

47:31.320 --> 47:36.630
I mean, Laimutis could be
a botanist, for example.

47:37.160 --> 47:42.200
And Punk could be that guy who cuts out your tongue
if he hears the word Laimutis again. Got it?

47:42.200 --> 47:43.920
- Hmm.
- I'll show you hmm.

47:47.600 --> 47:49.800
Mom? Did you buy firewood for winter? Hm?

47:49.800 --> 47:52.800
Yes, and I think it should be enough.

47:52.800 --> 47:53.680
Mhm.

47:53.680 --> 47:56.120
Well, the neighbors' boy
Virgie helped, chopped it up.

47:56.120 --> 47:57.280
Oh, that's nice, that's nice.

47:57.280 --> 48:02.510
You know, now that Dad's gone, it's
so hard for me to do all that work.

48:04.520 --> 48:08.360
And you hardly ever call or visit...

48:11.480 --> 48:15.240
And you know how important you are to me.

48:15.240 --> 48:19.040
I don't know anything, just what I read
about you in the paper and nothing else.

48:19.040 --> 48:21.080
And the papers, well you
know what they write.

48:21.080 --> 48:22.830
Not to mention the comments.

48:24.880 --> 48:25.920
I have no words for it.

48:25.920 --> 48:27.800
Mom, stop reading those comments, huh.

48:28.600 --> 48:30.800
Oh, you probably need money.

48:30.800 --> 48:34.880
I have money, you know, I get pension now
and I definitely don't need that much.

48:34.880 --> 48:36.840
Mom, I can give you money
myself, like this much.

48:38.240 --> 48:39.960
Alright, alright, eat.

48:41.680 --> 48:42.720
Ah... Needs salt.

48:42.720 --> 48:43.880
Child, go get the salt...

48:43.880 --> 48:45.760
Don't make the kid run around.
Everything's fine.

48:45.760 --> 48:47.640
There's enough salt,
everything's really good.

48:47.640 --> 48:49.680
I'll get some pepper, OK?

48:49.680 --> 48:51.680
Sit down. Everything's fine.

48:51.680 --> 48:53.720
I know you like pepper, Laimutis.

48:53.720 --> 48:56.360
Mom, no one calls me Laimutis.

48:56.360 --> 48:58.560
Child, you will always be Laimutis to me.

48:58.560 --> 49:01.040
Dad and I came up with
that name for you and...

49:01.040 --> 49:03.000
You came up with it, not Dad.

49:04.800 --> 49:06.470
Oh, what's the difference.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.880
Well fine, eat. Is it good?

49:11.480 --> 49:12.560
Yeah, very.

49:12.560 --> 49:14.080
Oh child...

49:14.080 --> 49:16.000
...you got some on yourself here.

49:16.000 --> 49:20.440
Mom! Pfu, how disgusting,
I could never stand that.

49:22.760 --> 49:24.110
Oh what's the big deal now...

49:27.000 --> 49:30.760
Gerda, you know, you can
always come visit me.

49:31.800 --> 49:35.040
Tomorrow you'll see how beautiful
it is here, windmills, mmm...

49:35.040 --> 49:37.720
Just come whenever you feel like it, OK?

49:37.720 --> 49:40.160
- Promise?
- I promise.

49:40.160 --> 49:42.920
Oh, right, you have your
own grandma and grandpa.

49:42.920 --> 49:45.080
Actually...

49:45.080 --> 49:46.430
...I don't.

49:48.760 --> 49:49.800
Wait...

49:51.040 --> 49:52.520
...what do you mean you don't?

49:52.520 --> 49:54.640
Oh, Laimutis, Gytis...

49:54.640 --> 49:57.870
Mom, stop with the KGB
investigations already...

49:58.160 --> 49:59.200
But what have I...

49:59.200 --> 50:03.320
- Come on, let us eat, let's just sit here nicely, huh...
- What did I ask that was so wrong?

50:03.680 --> 50:06.120
You don't even understand
that you're annoying.

50:06.280 --> 50:07.640
Let's just sit, huh.

50:07.640 --> 50:10.120
Lord, how often do I see you.

50:10.120 --> 50:12.110
You come once a year...

50:15.080 --> 50:19.760
You'll see. When you have your own children
and they grow up, then you'll find me.

50:19.760 --> 50:23.920
And by the way, it's about time you
started thinking about children yourself.

50:23.920 --> 50:26.560
Oh, just don't start...

50:26.560 --> 50:27.920
Please, just don't start.

50:27.920 --> 50:30.880
Oh Lord, how old are you, have
you even thought about it?

50:30.880 --> 50:34.840
Here Gytis, he seemed so hopeless, and
even he has a little princess here...

50:34.840 --> 50:37.310
Mom, I'm not Gytis, understand?

50:37.800 --> 50:39.710
No, I'm not saying anything. Yes...

50:40.640 --> 50:42.520
But I want grandchildren.

50:42.520 --> 50:44.440
When the time comes you'll
have those grandchildren.

50:44.440 --> 50:45.880
What are you getting on my case for?

50:45.880 --> 50:47.920
But when is that time going to come?

50:47.920 --> 50:50.080
- You're already 33, child...
- Well and so what!

50:50.080 --> 50:51.200
Oh child...

50:51.200 --> 50:54.240
I know you have some girl.

50:54.240 --> 50:54.840
Mom...

50:54.840 --> 50:56.480
- if you'd just introduce us...
- Mom!

50:56.480 --> 51:00.560
You'd introduce us, we'd sit
down together, have a chat.

51:00.560 --> 51:03.200
Lord, I want grandchildren so much...

51:03.200 --> 51:04.240
Mom!!!

51:04.640 --> 51:07.560
Are you ever going to stop
with all that nonsense?

51:07.560 --> 51:10.470
Every time the same old thing.

51:10.960 --> 51:13.110
You don't like this, you don't like that.

51:13.960 --> 51:16.720
There's something wrong with the way
I'm dressed. You don't like my hair.

51:16.720 --> 51:18.720
You read some comments.

51:18.720 --> 51:22.080
They say I'm gay. Yeah, Mom, I'm gay. OK?

51:22.480 --> 51:25.160
What, maybe it'd be better if I was, huh?

51:25.160 --> 51:28.950
Maybe we wouldn't have all of these stupid
questions about girls and grandchildren.

51:29.400 --> 51:32.000
I'm sick of it, sick of it all!

51:33.360 --> 51:35.240
You can drive anyone crazy.

51:35.240 --> 51:40.680
You probably even drove Dad to his
grave with all of your nonsense.

52:22.680 --> 52:23.910
Mind if I sit down?

52:33.320 --> 52:36.310
There, see... You see who I
am, what kind of person I am.

52:39.600 --> 52:40.880
Everything's fine.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.200
I know you didn't want
to say that to your mom.

52:44.760 --> 52:46.080
But I did...

52:48.720 --> 52:51.760
She didn't mean any harm, so she...

52:51.760 --> 52:52.910
Well yeah.

52:54.120 --> 52:57.400
But the important thing is that
you understand that yourself.

52:59.280 --> 53:01.510
Oh, but so what...

53:03.480 --> 53:06.800
And on top of it all I
managed to hurt my mom.

53:06.800 --> 53:08.680
Imagine, my real mom.

53:18.680 --> 53:19.880
And Dad...

53:19.880 --> 53:22.400
Oh Gerda...

53:24.280 --> 53:27.160
You know, Dad...

53:29.320 --> 53:33.470
I would do anything if I
could just, you know...

53:36.840 --> 53:39.960
There's so much I still want to
tell him, you know... he was...

53:39.960 --> 53:42.560
I think he would be proud of you.

53:42.560 --> 53:44.230
Come on...

53:44.880 --> 53:48.950
I don't think there's anyone in the
entire world who could be proud of me.

53:49.320 --> 53:50.800
I'm proud of you.

53:51.760 --> 53:53.880
You're a really good person.

53:53.880 --> 53:56.270
Just you don't always show it.

53:58.080 --> 53:58.990
You think so?

54:02.000 --> 54:05.470
Well, I guess I'm... I'm
just like my dad, you know.

54:06.360 --> 54:08.110
It's never too late to change.

54:08.520 --> 54:09.920
Change what?

54:09.920 --> 54:11.040
Well...

54:11.040 --> 54:16.120
To stop hiding... from what you're feeling.

54:17.160 --> 54:18.480
To be more open.

54:20.200 --> 54:23.160
Tell your mom what you're feeling.

54:23.160 --> 54:25.240
Or your dad...

54:25.240 --> 54:26.640
My dad?

54:27.760 --> 54:29.640
How can I do that?

54:29.640 --> 54:34.560
You know, Momma told me that
people-they don't actually die.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.960
They choose one of the stars
in the sky and move there.

54:39.680 --> 54:42.640
They're always watching what
you're doing and smiling.

54:44.520 --> 54:49.070
Obviously, it's too bad that they
can't answer so that you can hear.

54:49.600 --> 54:52.040
But you just look at that sky.

54:52.040 --> 54:54.680
Do you see how many stars there are?
Thousands.

54:54.680 --> 54:58.080
So how am I supposed to know
which one it is exactly...

54:58.080 --> 55:00.000
That doesn't make any difference at all.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.470
Just pick the one you like most and
you're guaranteed to get it right.

55:06.160 --> 55:07.070
You think?

55:12.240 --> 55:14.080
There, this one, see?

55:14.080 --> 55:14.880
Mhm.

55:18.160 --> 55:22.640
So, like, just up and say it? Talk to it?

55:22.640 --> 55:25.320
Well, yeah. it's simple.

55:25.320 --> 55:27.600
It's going to look stupid
somehow, I don't know.

55:27.600 --> 55:29.990
Just give it a try, I mean, no one can see.

55:33.680 --> 55:34.560
Gerda...

55:35.040 --> 55:36.680
Kid, it's late.

55:36.680 --> 55:39.040
I made the bed, let's go get some sleep.

55:39.040 --> 55:40.080
Go on.

57:09.480 --> 57:10.400
Close your eyes.

57:10.400 --> 57:11.200
Are your eyes closed?

57:11.200 --> 57:12.320
Yeah, they're closed.

57:12.320 --> 57:13.720
Don't look, don't look. Stand here.

57:13.720 --> 57:14.720
Are your eyes closed?

57:14.720 --> 57:16.440
Well, yeah, they're closed, they're closed.

57:17.920 --> 57:18.880
Ta-dah!

57:18.880 --> 57:20.840
- So, what do you think?
- Oh-ho.

57:22.560 --> 57:24.760
This is oh-ho-ho, not oh-ho!

57:24.760 --> 57:26.360
It's so old.

57:26.360 --> 57:29.590
Yeah, but the tires, the spare, it's full.

57:30.560 --> 57:32.560
And you really think it works?

57:32.560 --> 57:33.910
Of course it works!

57:34.560 --> 57:37.520
My dad took such good care of it, he
wouldn't even let a fly shit on it.

57:38.600 --> 57:40.400
Let's see if the battery's working.

57:41.800 --> 57:43.200
Oh! Wow, you see...

57:43.200 --> 57:45.800
it's Russian, but it's
got that German quality.

57:45.800 --> 57:47.870
Oh! Awesome. Look what I found.

57:49.760 --> 57:51.120
Wow!

57:51.120 --> 57:54.350
Man, I've been looking for that forever.

57:56.360 --> 57:57.760
Oh look, and it goes.

57:57.760 --> 57:58.720
Hold this.

57:58.720 --> 57:59.840
Put it in, we might need it.

58:00.480 --> 58:01.990
Right, what do we have here...

58:03.160 --> 58:05.630
ls there any gas...

58:06.280 --> 58:07.960
Give me the matches, I can't see.

58:07.960 --> 58:10.350
Where are they?

58:11.840 --> 58:13.590
That was a joke, kid.

58:15.080 --> 58:16.830
Listen, hand me the canister, huh?

58:17.920 --> 58:19.800
Look and see if there's
anything in there, huh?

58:21.600 --> 58:22.720
No, you know, it's empty.

58:23.040 --> 58:26.240
Alright, come on, let's get it outside.
We'll take a look. Open the door.

58:26.480 --> 58:28.600
Come on, faster, faster, faster...

58:29.600 --> 58:31.640
Come on, you can help push from behind.

58:31.640 --> 58:32.600
Are you pushing?

58:32.760 --> 58:34.560
Oh God, it's so hard...

58:34.560 --> 58:37.280
it's not hard, it's life that's hard.
This is nothing.

58:38.400 --> 58:39.550
Diddly-squat.

58:42.080 --> 58:42.880
OK.

58:43.520 --> 58:46.120
- Run over and get that canister.
- Aha, alright.

58:56.560 --> 58:57.880
What's so funny?

58:57.880 --> 58:59.680
Should I give you some matches?

59:06.400 --> 59:07.440
Awesome, really.

59:16.920 --> 59:18.120
What's wrong with it...

59:18.120 --> 59:19.440
You said it works.

59:19.440 --> 59:21.080
It works, it works, it has to work.

59:21.080 --> 59:22.750
Maybe it sucked something up.

59:23.840 --> 59:24.800
Yeah, yeah...

59:24.800 --> 59:25.840
Come on, beautiful.

59:25.840 --> 59:27.190
Not that one.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:00.840
- I got you.
- Aha, you got me.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.880
Mm, listen, what songs do you like, huh?

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:11.600
Or some group, or musician, singer.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.350
Well, obviously, I should be in
first place, but who's second?

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:20.590
Well, maybe... those three girls?

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:26.680
- Who? What, are you serious?
- Well yeah.

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:30.830
- Three girls? Huh?
- I like their songs.

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.560
Songs?

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.560
I could write so many songs
like that, like this many.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.990
So write them.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.440
Morons!

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.080
Now I'm going to up and
put it together, look.

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:46.880
Yeah, you want me to write you a song.
Right now?

01:02:46.881 --> 01:02:49.031
Well you'll have it.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.280
Alright.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:52.360
I'm waiting.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.030
OK, look, you morons, look.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.760
Somehow, hold on, just a sec.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.400
OK, I've got to concentrate a little.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.480
Did... did you...

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.760
<i>Did you see... hmmm...</i>

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.320
...how...

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.600
<i>...how she dances...</i>

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.110
<i>Hmmm...</i>

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.510
That's good.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.510
<i>...all alone, when there's no one left...</i>

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.190
<i>Hmmm...</i>

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.080
<i>Alone...</i>

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.310
<i>Hmmm...</i>

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.680
<i>...in that universe</i>

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:32.880
<i>Hmmm...</i>

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.600
<i>She dances up on her tippy toes</i>

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:40.480
No.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:45.640
<i>She dances... dances with her eyes closed</i>

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:48.720
<i>Into the morning</i>

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.640
<i>...into the morning</i>

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:50.400
Good.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.400
<i>Hmmm...</i>

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.480
Alright.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.520
<i>So many tears</i>

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:55.480
<i>Hmmm...</i>

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.440
<i>Children's fairy tales</i>

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.920
<i>A little princess' wonderful dresses</i>

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.920
Could you give me your arm?

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:45.840
What's this?

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.390
It's a friendship bracelet,
so you don't forget me.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:51.470
Yeah...

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.080
Gerda, how do you think I
could ever forget you, huh?

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.310
I don't know, you never know.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.680
Come on, thank you, that's awesome.

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:06.560
No problem, it's nothing.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.560
But I...

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.520
...I don't have anything to give you.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.240
Don't worry.

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.400
I already got a present from you.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.280
You.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.750
Oh child, do you have everything?

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:39.240
I don't think I had anything with me,
so there's nothing I can forget.

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:43.240
- Oy, so when are you going to come visit again?
- See, Mom, I don't know.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.840
- Sometime, like always.
- You're always welcome, you know.

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.640
I'm so glad you came.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.240
I'll stop by.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.120
Alright.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:52.840
Well, thanks then.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:53.990
Don't mention it.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.400
You know, actually, about yesterday, I...

01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.560
I wanted to apologize, that was stupid...

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.360
it's nothing, I've already forgotten.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:02.920
- Everything's fine.
- Seriously?

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.200
Well don't be mad, I mean, you know.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.640
- Well get going, you're going to be late.
- Alright.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.640
- Take care, my son.
- Thanks, Mom. Bye.

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.840
Take care, Laimutis. Look, this is for you.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:13.280
- Oh no, I'm not taking that.
- Take it, you have to.

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.800
- Please, it's nothing, just look.
- But Mom, I'm...

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.160
Well I don't have anywhere to put it...

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.440
- it'll go bad, I don't have...
- Please, Laimutis, take it.

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:24.280
- OK, fine, you're not going to give up anyway.
- Oh that's great, you see.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:28.000
Gerda, don't you forget that
you're always welcome here.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:28.960
Understand?

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:32.400
With your dad, with your mom, alright?

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.440
- Buckle up.
- Alright, Mom.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.760
Drive carefully, OK? Take care!

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.120
- Bye, Mom, thanks, see you.
- Bye. See you!

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.870
So...

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.750
That's it.

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.560
I hope your momma will be back already.

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.000
Probably.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.310
I'll say.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:50.720
Oh, right, at first I was
a little rude with you.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.120
No big deal.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.399
Yeah, everything's OK?

01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.229
Sorry.

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.880
But we had a good time, didn't we?

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:06.560
We did...

01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:14.399
Oh, right, thanks for...

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.830
...for the present.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:20.600
I'll wear it.

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:24.990
But, see, I never did come up
with anything to give you.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:27.600
Well...

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:32.470
...that song was for me? Or
was it for someone else?

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.120
Oh, that...

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.109
Yeah, for you, for you, alright.

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.160
I'll try to finish it up, or...

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.550
Well I guess I'll be going.

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:51.270
Yeah...

01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:54.189
Yeah...

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.240
Oh, that door, just a sec.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.160
Well...

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:15.200
...so I guess I'll see you then.

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:18.360
Yeah...

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:25.950
Alright, go on.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:09.360
What are you sitting here for?

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:11.390
She's not home again.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:14.480
- Momma's not home again?
- Mhm...

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.630
Oh, I found this in the car.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.230
Yeah, I left it there by mistake.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.430
What are you going to do now?

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:36.960
What choice do I have?

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.710
I'll wait for Momma.

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.880
Well, what would you do without me, huh?

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.310
Kid?

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.240
Mhm.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:12.080
Thank you.

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.470
It's nice to have you here.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.640
There's one person here in this hall...

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:29.150
...who is very, very important to me and...

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:34.670
...who I'd like to thank.

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.200
You know who you are.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.640
<i>In the bottom of the sea</i>

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.430
<i>I'll only leave what hurts
every day and night</i>

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:55.040
<i>In the yellow sun, I'll
only leave what's important</i>

01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:02.990
<i>I'll turn off my thoughts and close the
door to keep out all kinds of troubles</i>

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:08.200
<i>From now on, I'm different,
not the same as I was before</i>

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:14.360
<i>The same as I was before,
the same as I was before</i>

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:23.120
<i>Alone on an island</i>

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.840
<i>In the light of the moon</i>

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.440
<i>When no one is looking</i>

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.040
<i>No one is listening</i>

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:31.520
<i>No one is looking</i>

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:35.510
<i>Where you are, always alone</i>

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.840
<i>Happy in my heart</i>

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.880
<i>When no one is looking</i>

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:44.760
<i>No one is looking where you are</i>

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:54.830
<i>I'll throw away the keys, board up the
windows from an unacquainted friend</i>

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:59.800
<i>I'll just leave a letter, you'll
feel it, really, I am important</i>

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:08.720
<i>I hope then the new day will
wake up with a smile on its lips</i>

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:12.950
<i>Because from now on, I'm different,
not the same as I was before</i>

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.960
<i>Not the same as I was before</i>

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.230
<i>The same as I was before</i>

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:23.840
Yeah!

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:27.600
<i>Alone on an island</i>

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.560
<i>In the light of the moon</i>

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.600
<i>When no one is looking</i>

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.080
<i>No one is listening</i>

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.520
<i>No one is looking...</i>

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:40.560
<i>...where you are, always alone</i>

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.440
<i>Happy in my heart...</i>

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.240
What do you think, it's not too loud?

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:49.560
What, are the neighbors complaining?

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:53.030
Not the neighbors. You're being detained
for 48 hours as a child abduction suspect.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.320
What... what child?

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.200
Abduction of what child?

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.280
Where are we going?

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.400
Pals, what are you doing?

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.120
We're not pals to you, we're officers.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.880
- Let me go, let me go...
- Punk!

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.680
- Let me go... Gerda!
- Dad! Dad!

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.640
- Gerda! Let her go! I'm her father!
- Let him go!

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.710
He didn't do anything...

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:14.040
- Let me go!
- Gerda, let's go let's go.

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:14.840
Dad!

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:17.960
- Gerda... Where are you taking her?
- Dad, they're hurting me!

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:21.710
- Gerda!
- lt'd be better if you didn't resist.

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:23.960
We're working.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.030
Thank you, everyone.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:28.640
Thank you.

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:31.830
You...

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.960
Come in.

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.800
Gerda, Gerdut...

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.160
Momma...

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.830
God, come over here. Come on, come on.

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.760
How are you, my little
baby, how are you, huh?

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.240
Where have you been?

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.360
Can you even imagine how
worried I was about you, huh?

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.520
Why don't you both sit down over here.

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.960
Both of you.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.600
It'll be more comfortable.

01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.000
L...

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:06.790
You know, Gytis, so much happened to me
during those couple of days, you know...

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.200
Punk, do you even get why you're here?

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.720
They locked me up here
for no reason at all.

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:15.880
None at all!

01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:18.880
They just came in the middle of the concert, got
us together, cuffed me and locked me up here.

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:23.000
So I don't get it, you're like
taking the place of her mother?

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.320
Well... yeah.

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.520
Yeah.

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:32.760
Every kid wants to have a mom or a dad.

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.480
And at home we let ourselves
call each other that.

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.400
Mm. I see.

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:43.760
So basically, when we found her, it turned out
during the initial interview that she wasn't hurt.

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:44.960
Gerda, really?

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:45.960
Everything's alright?

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:48.640
- Yes, Momma, everything's fine.
- Where were you, huh?

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:52.520
We found her with a certain person.

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.920
Do you recognize him?

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:08.910
Gerda...

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:12.720
You, you remember there
was that girl Aistė, huh?

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:14.760
- Yeah, sure.
- Remember? 10 years ago.

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:16.160
- I remember.
- Yeah, yeah...

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.480
...the one where we were in
love with each other and...

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:23.240
...then her parents took her away and
we broke up all unhappy and then...

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:24.680
imagine, Gytis...

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.800
...l... l just found out that...

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:31.000
...that she has a little
girl and I'm the father.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.600
And suddenly-boom -she's right here...

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:34.600
Gerda's her name.

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:35.920
She's, she's amazing.

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:38.000
Gytis, if only you could see
her, what she looks like...

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.480
She's exactly like me.

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.080
She's so, so sweet and...

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:48.430
...and so pretty, charismatic,
she can dance and she found that tractor...

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:50.320
Punk, she's not your daughter.

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.000
So you recognize him, right?

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:55.310
Well, yes, yes, that's...

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.800
That's... my ex-boyfriend, Punk.

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:00.960
- Punk?
- I mean...

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:02.710
...his name is Laimis.

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:04.760
Momma...

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:06.800
...you were right about him.

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:09.280
He really is nice.

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:15.680
Gerda, but what I told you about him doesn't
mean that you can go and run away from home.

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:19.520
Sweetie, do you understand - that was a
nice story and that's all, nothing else.

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:20.870
What story?

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:25.320
With that girl... she ran
away from the orphanage.

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.830
Look.

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:34.710
- What are you, stupid?
- Now you're a real star.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:38.320
I don't know what you've cooked up,
but you, old man, are in deep shit.

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:44.800
You're being charged with a girl's abduction,
captivity, exploitation, I don't know what else...

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:46.960
it's on the record.

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:49.270
Gytis, it... it's bull.

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.560
It's total bull!

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:54.360
And the story is that...

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:58.950
...me and Gerda are really
good friends, right?

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:04.230
And Gerda is my favorite girl in the world.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:12.680
And one day, that little girl asked me
what happens when two people fall in love.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:18.040
And I told her about one
person who is very dear to me.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:20.630
This person.

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:28.920
I told her about what we used to do,
where we used to go, right, Gerda?

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:36.030
But I never would have believed
that you could do this.

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:45.310
You have to understand -this
girl has some problems...

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:50.030
You... you know I'm not lying, don't you?

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:51.870
You believe me, right?

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:55.510
I believe you, but the
cops see it differently.

01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:59.520
Gytis, don't leave me, alright...

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.080
Gytis, don't leave me, huh...

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:06.470
We'll do something together, you
know you can, you always save me...

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:10.480
- Gytis... I'm begging you, work something out...
- I'll try. But I can't promise.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:12.280
I don't know where to begin.

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.760
I always used to get you out of
all kinds of garbage, but...

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.510
- ...this situation is... I'll try.
- So do it again now...

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.600
I'll try.

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.880
Gytis, don't forget, alright?

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:26.270
But I can't promise.

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:31.320
She tends to identify with things
that don't exist in reality.

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:32.560
What?

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:36.840
She tends to identify with what
doesn't exist in reality, understand?

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.240
Of course I understand.

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:43.120
Like, she identified with
that story that you told her.

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.240
Well, yeah.

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:45.720
Turns out she did.

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:51.430
Gerda, honey, tell me, you left home
because you wanted to find him. Right?

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:56.640
Momma, please, don't be angry with me...

01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:02.270
I, well, I just wanted to have the
kind of dad that you talked about.

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:07.270
And you, sir, don't be angry with him.

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.270
Let him go.

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:13.560
It's me, this is all because of me.

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:14.880
He's not guilty.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.080
I'm sorry.

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.520
It's nothing. Don't apologize.

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:23.320
You don't have to apologize, baby.

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:25.400
You understand that everything is fine.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:29.760
We're going to go home now and no one,
no one is going to be angry with you.

01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:31.560
So everything's clear.

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:34.400
Name and signature.

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:37.880
What's this for?

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.270
That you don't have any claims,
everything turned out fine.

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:42.680
Thank God that everything turned out fine.

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:50.830
Oh yeah, and what's going
to happen with that guy?

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.750
With Punk? Or Laimis?

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:57.600
Well...

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:05.840
Someone will have to tell him that he's better off
entertaining people than abducting girls. Right?

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:09.640
Thank you for understanding.

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:11.680
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:12.640
Bye, bye.

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:19.680
Well, you sure have paid your dues here.

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:22.680
Scoot over.

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:25.320
You've sat here long enough.

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:28.360
Thanks.

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:32.670
What?

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:37.080
Concert in Kaunas in two
days, will you be there?

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.880
In Kaunas?

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.520
That's progress.

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.190
Aha.

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:45.040
Yeah, I'll be there, of course.

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.320
I'll be there if you'll be there.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.070
What choice do I have.

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.200
You know, there's something I have to do.

01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:04.920
Yeah.

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:08.320
Thanks again.

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:20.880
Well now, take care of her, he says.

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:22.630
You can't even take care of yourself.

01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:24.920
I can take care of myself...

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:29.720
I... well yeah, maybe I've been going through a tough
time lately, but I'm going to get it together...

01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:35.200
Maybe I've been having a tough with music time
lately, but I... I'll find a job, a normal job.

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:38.560
I can work, I've got a degree
as an auto mechanic, a voc...

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.080
I can fix cars, everything's fine...

01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:42.720
- You're talking about work here?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:45.360
What work are you talking about here?
What work?

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:50.550
I know about you, believe me,
I've read stuff and seen things.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:52.640
You get in fights.

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.630
You throw bottles from the stage.

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.640
No, that's already, that just...

01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:01.000
...that was a long time ago and I...
everything's different.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.920
You have to understand,
Gerda, we're friends and...

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:07.600
She'll really be well-off with me...

01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:12.000
You understand that a child, parental
rights, is a huge responsibility.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.800
A child is not an animal, not a dog.

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:17.520
Yes, I understand everything perfectly.

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.190
I'm not a child.

01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:21.440
I can handle it.

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:26.110
Give me... just give me a chance.

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.200
Good bye.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.710
- No, no, listen, I'll... I'll really take care of her...
- Good bye.

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:50.030
Gabrielė, you hear, tomorrow you're not going
to get out of it that easy, understand?

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:56.350
You...

01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.480
Me.

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.430
Hi.

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.200
Mm, you look good.

01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:10.720
Thanks...

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:15.160
...you've also changed.

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:17.800
Yeah...

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.680
See, I was on top and there...

01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:22.320
it's been a long time, huh?

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:29.160
Somehow... l didn't think
we'd meet like this again.

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:31.830
Well, you see.

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:36.070
Turns out something brings us together.

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:45.920
Ah, I don't know, maybe
this'll sound dumb, but...

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:50.630
...how... how about some coffee?

01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.280
With two sugars?

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:03.480
Yeah...

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:06.800
Yeah, I haven't changed that much yet.

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.510
That's good, good that you
haven't changed that much yet.

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:28.600
<i>Friends, I'd like to end
this show with a new song.</i>

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:33.720
<i>You probably all remember Punk, an artist who
was off the radar for quite a long time...</i>

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:36.800
<i>...but who is coming back
with a great new track.</i>

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:41.640
<i>I'm really happy that Punk is back, and it looks like
he's doing a good job regaining his former glory.</i>

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:45.320
<i>So then, in first place
- Punk and his new hit.</i>

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:53.350
<i>Did you see, hmm...</i>

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:56.640
<i>How she dances, hmm...</i>

01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:02.350
<i>All alone, when there's no one left, hmm...</i>

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.430
<i>The only one, hmm...</i>

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:14.080
<i>She dances with her eyes closed
into the morning, hmmm...</i>

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:17.040
<i>So many tears, hmm...</i>

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:25.040
<i>Children's fairy tales, a little
princess' wonderful dresses, hmm...</i>

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.800
<i>I can't, hmm...</i>

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.710
<i>I can't find that many words...</i>

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:38.800
<i>No one can understand what she feels</i>

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:41.470
<i>Give me strength</i>

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:47.390
<i>There's no other words</i>

01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:52.840
<i>Because when you dance</i>

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:55.960
<i>I am calm</i>

01:29:55.960 --> 01:30:00.080
<i>I laugh on the outside, so
that the inside stops hurting</i>

01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:04.230
<i>Did you see, hmm...</i>

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:07.230
<i>How she walks, hmm...</i>

01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:13.120
<i>As if she had never touched
the ground, hmm...</i>

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:16.160
<i>And the secret, hmm...</i>

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:19.230
<i>Reflection in her face</i>

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:24.430
<i>And I pray quietly with my eyes closed</i>

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.880
<i>Just don't stop, hmm...</i>

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:30.790
<i>Give me your heart</i>

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:35.680
<i>All I need is a little piece</i>

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.920
<i>Even though not everyone will
understand, I want to be closer</i>

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:49.560
<i>I'll dance even though I've never tried</i>

01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:52.080
<i>Give me strength</i>

01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:58.750
<i>There's no other words</i>

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:06.600
<i>Because when you dance, I am calm</i>

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:11.520
<i>I laugh on the outside, so
that the inside stops hurting</i>

01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:13.000
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.310
<i>Give me strength</i>

01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:21.960
<i>There's no other words</i>

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:30.400
<i>Because when you dance, I am calm</i>

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:35.030
<i>I laugh on the outside, so
that the inside stops hurting</i>

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:45.240
<i>There's no other words</i>

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:53.880
<i>Because when you dance, I am calm</i>

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:59.000
<i>I laugh on the outside, so
that the inside stops hurting</i>

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:04.840
<i>I laugh on the outside, so
that the inside stops hurting</i>

01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:10.000
<i>I laugh on the outside, so
that the inside stops hurting</i>

01:32:11.305 --> 01:32:17.356
