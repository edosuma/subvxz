WEBVTT

00:12.263 --> 00:16.225
Good evening, Elijah, ma'am.

00:16.267 --> 00:18.269
(music playing in distance)

00:48.048 --> 00:50.050
Hey, hey.

00:52.970 --> 00:55.389
-How you doing?
-Good to see you, man.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.822
(Bell sighs)

01:11.864 --> 01:15.451
What is this man
doing to the piano?

01:15.451 --> 01:17.411
They make the records
in the Neutral Zone

01:17.453 --> 01:19.455
and we smuggle them in.

01:21.749 --> 01:24.585
BELL:
(stammers) Du Bois.
H-How did you get that?

01:24.627 --> 01:27.421
ELIJAH:
(chuckles)
That's not all we smuggle in.

01:31.133 --> 01:34.136
-Whoa-- I...
-Why, this here's the biggest
collection in the JPS.

01:34.178 --> 01:38.974
ELIJAH:
Karl Marx, Marcus Garvey,
Ida B. Wells.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.185
I-I thought these were
all burned by the Kempeitai.

01:41.227 --> 01:44.688
Oh, they burn them all right,
but we print them again.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.566
-I want to read them all.
-(chuckles) Careful, now.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.402
You get caught out on the street
with one of those... Whew!

01:50.444 --> 01:53.072
I'm not afraid.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.282
Hey. How y'all doing?

01:55.324 --> 01:57.326
(excited chatter)

01:59.995 --> 02:02.665
(laughter)

02:07.837 --> 02:09.421
ALL:
Amen.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.257
EQUIANO:
That's a beautiful sound.

02:11.298 --> 02:15.302
Now, I see a lot of familiar
faces in this room.

02:15.344 --> 02:18.514
Doctors,

02:18.556 --> 02:22.017
teachers, artists.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.019
(chuckles)

02:24.061 --> 02:26.772
And new faces, too.

02:28.399 --> 02:31.944
I bring good news.

02:31.986 --> 02:36.031
Two days ago,
the first shipment of arms

02:36.073 --> 02:38.617
arrived from our allies
in China.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.619
We gonna take this movement
to the next stage.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.996
ALL:
Mm-hmm.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.748
Now, I'm not gonna lie.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.042
There will be sacrifices.

02:47.084 --> 02:52.047
But for us,
that price is nothing new.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.716
Most everyone in this room

02:53.757 --> 02:58.012
has someone got put on a train
in the Reich,

02:58.053 --> 03:00.055
ain't never came back.

03:02.850 --> 03:06.145
For my wife,

03:06.186 --> 03:09.148
and my daughter,

03:09.189 --> 03:12.860
the train stopped at a camp

03:12.902 --> 03:16.739
in Saginaw, Michigan.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.783
Onslow, North Carolina.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.201
Sorry for your loss, brother.

03:21.243 --> 03:24.163
WOMAN:
Shiloh, Pennsylvania.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.415
James and Martha Arnold.

03:26.457 --> 03:28.417
James and Martha.

03:28.459 --> 03:31.211
-Sorry for your loss, ma'am.
-Thank you.

03:31.253 --> 03:33.172
MAN:
Robert Shepherd.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.590
Owensboro, Kentucky.

03:34.632 --> 03:36.550
WOMAN 2:
Mason City, Iowa.

03:36.592 --> 03:38.636
John and Mary Swan.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.262
Monroe, Louisiana.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.014
Jed Fabers.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.432
WOMAN 3:
Charles and Nancy Johnson.

03:43.474 --> 03:44.850
WOMAN 4:
Greenville, Mississippi.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.769
OSCAR:
Zionsville, Indiana.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.520
-John and Alva Watson.
-(voices echoing)

03:48.562 --> 03:51.065
Moulton, Alabama.

03:53.108 --> 03:55.611
Daddy and Mama.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.740
How about right here
in San Francisco, California?

03:59.782 --> 04:02.117
William Pullum.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.119
Y'all know
what I'm talking about.

04:04.161 --> 04:06.747
Shot in the back by the
Kempeitai nine blocks from here.

04:06.789 --> 04:09.625
-And that was just last week.
-EQUIANO: Last week--

04:09.667 --> 04:12.461
last week?

04:12.503 --> 04:16.715
This same chain of violence
runs through our whole history

04:16.757 --> 04:20.386
in this country,
from slavery to this very day.

04:22.554 --> 04:26.225
You've served your people
as doctors,

04:26.266 --> 04:29.228
teachers and artists.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.271
But tonight?

04:33.315 --> 04:37.277
Tonight I'm looking for men
and women to be soldiers.

04:38.487 --> 04:41.824
Who's ready to be a soldier?

04:42.866 --> 04:44.618
I am.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.955
I am.

04:50.666 --> 04:52.835
-I am.
-I am.

04:52.876 --> 04:55.754
ALL (overlapping):
I am.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.756
-Mm-hmm.
-Yes, sir.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.842
-I am.
-I am.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.301
-Yes.
-Thank you.

05:03.137 --> 05:05.139
Thank all of you.

(machines beeping)

07:05.217 --> 07:07.010
We've made great progress

07:07.052 --> 07:09.972
since your last visit,
Reichsmarschall.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.974
The knowledge
they are gaining surpasses

07:12.015 --> 07:14.309
our wildest expectations.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.687
Uh, sir, please, please.

07:16.728 --> 07:20.107
We've sent a series of teams

07:20.149 --> 07:23.443
of Weltkommando agents through
the portal, as you instructed,

07:23.485 --> 07:27.239
and we have been able
to mine that world

07:27.281 --> 07:31.952
for scientific innovations,
its military secrets.

07:31.994 --> 07:34.204
We are draining the alt-world

07:34.246 --> 07:38.041
of all technological
and cultural intelligence.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.377
And not just from America.

07:40.419 --> 07:44.047
We now have teams
in Europe and Asia, too.

07:44.089 --> 07:47.176
And they don't even know
we're there.

07:47.217 --> 07:51.638
However, they are improving
their nuclear capabilities.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.440
They're advancing.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.733
The Americans and the Russians.

08:02.774 --> 08:06.111
Do they know about our world?

08:06.153 --> 08:09.239
Beyond a few academic papers,

08:09.281 --> 08:11.658
they have no sense
of the Multiverse,

08:11.700 --> 08:14.494
no grasp of portal technology.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.496
Oh, whoever wrote those papers
seemed to have

08:16.538 --> 08:19.124
a pretty advanced understanding
of quantum mechanics.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.709
We are taking care of it.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.669
This way, Reichsmarschall.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.588
I have something
to show you, hmm?

08:35.974 --> 08:38.018
-Has Abendsen been cooperating?
-Oh, yes.

08:38.060 --> 08:39.853
(chuckles)

08:39.895 --> 08:42.773
We have him working around
the clock, analyzing the films.

08:42.814 --> 08:47.527
Identifying multiple worlds.

08:52.574 --> 08:55.160
What are we looking at?

08:55.202 --> 08:56.787
The Map...

08:57.829 --> 09:00.249
...of the Multiverse.

09:13.178 --> 09:18.684
This, this is our world.

09:18.725 --> 09:22.062
And this is the alternate world
we have reached.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.982
So like our own, no?

09:25.023 --> 09:27.818
Except the Axis lost the war.

09:27.859 --> 09:30.487
Which is why it's critical
we understand it.

09:32.864 --> 09:37.035
But soon,
we'll reach other worlds,

09:37.077 --> 09:38.829
and more beyond that.

09:38.870 --> 09:43.667
Harvesting the intelligence
of world after world,

09:43.709 --> 09:47.296
defeating everyone
across the Multiverse.

09:47.337 --> 09:52.301
Every door out is a door in.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.803
Step up the sabotage program.

09:54.845 --> 09:58.140
I don't want any surprises
coming through this portal.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.440
CAMPBELL:
Sir, your wife, your son

10:06.481 --> 10:08.275
and yourself are alive
in a small town called

10:08.317 --> 10:11.570
Bailey's Crossroads, Virginia,
outside Washington, D.C.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.655
My daughters?

10:13.697 --> 10:17.909
In this alternate world, your
son is your only child, sir.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.039
What?

10:28.253 --> 10:30.255
You're certain?

10:34.134 --> 10:37.929
So, uh, so what about
my son's health?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.306
He shows no symptoms.

10:39.348 --> 10:43.018
He seems normal, sir.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.436
He plays sports.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.355
Popular, good in school.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.649
Mm...

10:50.984 --> 10:52.986
So what can you tell me
about my family here?

10:53.028 --> 10:57.324
Uh, am I, uh,
am I a military man?

10:57.366 --> 11:01.411
Well, a-actually, you...

11:01.453 --> 11:03.580
you are a businessman, sir.

11:03.622 --> 11:05.540
Businessman.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.918
-What kind of business?
-Insurance, sir.

11:07.959 --> 11:11.254
-An executive?
-You're in sales.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.672
In D.C.?

11:12.714 --> 11:14.674
All around.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.718
You...

11:19.012 --> 11:21.014
(clears throat)

11:21.056 --> 11:22.766
You-you travel, Reichsmarschall.

11:22.808 --> 11:24.601
I'm a traveling salesman.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.730
Okay.
(laughs softly)

11:28.772 --> 11:32.109
Road not taken leads to...

11:32.150 --> 11:33.527
(chuckles):
traveling salesman.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.946
You were awarded this-this
salesman of the year

11:35.987 --> 11:37.572
in the tri-state area, sir.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.866
It would appear
I'm moving up in the world.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.576
Hmm.

11:58.885 --> 12:02.139
JUDGE DAN HAYWOOD:
If all of the leaders
of the Third Reich

12:02.180 --> 12:05.183
had been sadistic monsters
and maniacs,

12:05.225 --> 12:09.521
then these events would have
no more moral significance

12:09.563 --> 12:11.523
than an earthquake.

12:11.565 --> 12:15.694
But this trial has shown
that under a national crisis,

12:15.735 --> 12:19.739
ordinary, even able
and extraordinary men

12:19.781 --> 12:23.743
can delude themselves
into the commission of crimes

12:23.785 --> 12:27.581
so vast and heinous that
they beggar the imagination.

12:27.622 --> 12:31.376
Let it now be noted
that here in our decision,

12:31.418 --> 12:34.004
this is what we stand for:

12:34.045 --> 12:38.091
justice, truth

12:38.133 --> 12:42.512
and the value
of a single human being.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.556

Judgment at Nuremberg, huh?

13:01.072 --> 13:03.909
That's that, uh,
Spencer Tracy picture?

13:03.950 --> 13:06.328
Yeah. Yeah, I saw the, uh,

13:06.369 --> 13:08.747
the matinee at the Majestic
for the second time.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.749
-Yeah? Huh.
-Mm.

13:10.790 --> 13:15.378
Wouldn't have made you
to be a... war movie type gal.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.631
Well, it's not
a war movie, exactly,

13:17.672 --> 13:20.717
it's, um,
more about good and evil.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.844
You know? Human nature.

13:22.886 --> 13:26.473
The more I know about human
nature, the more I like horses.

13:26.515 --> 13:29.309
Yeah, you and me both.

13:29.351 --> 13:32.479
Does make you wonder, though,
how millions of ordinary people

13:32.521 --> 13:35.774
could do such evil things.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.609
I don't know.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.569
They say we're not like them,

13:39.611 --> 13:41.571
but maybe people
aren't all that different.

13:41.613 --> 13:45.075
You know?
What if we're just... lucky?

13:45.116 --> 13:47.369
-(chuckles)
-What if?

13:47.410 --> 13:49.037
All right, come on, y'all.

13:49.079 --> 13:52.749
There is a time to talk,
and there's a time to dance.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.213
ALT-HELEN:
Oh! Look who's turned up, John.

13:58.255 --> 14:00.298
It's Juliana and Russ.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.343
Hello.
How about we get a pitcher?

14:03.385 --> 14:05.220
No, I'm paying.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.722
I sold a big policy, I'm in
the mood to celebrate. Come on.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.100
-Let's find-- oh-- a table.
Come on.
-RUSS: I don't need

14:10.141 --> 14:11.726
-any more insurance, John.
-Oh, I'm off the clock.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.395
-All right.
-Hey.

14:13.436 --> 14:16.231
Russ Gilmore, huh?

14:16.273 --> 14:19.651
Well, I got to know him
down at the stables.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.612
Turns out, we both have
a thing for Arabians.

14:24.489 --> 14:27.742
No. No, no, it's, uh,
it's not like that.

14:27.784 --> 14:30.579
-He's a good guy.
-Yeah, I'm sure he is.

14:30.620 --> 14:33.206
-I'm not looking.
-This world's a tough place

14:33.248 --> 14:35.208
to make a go of it on your own.

14:35.250 --> 14:38.211
It's good to find someone
you can trust, like I did.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.048
(indistinct whispering)

14:42.090 --> 14:44.301
You really think you know him?

14:44.342 --> 14:46.094
What do you mean?

14:46.136 --> 14:47.387
I mean, I-I don't know.

14:47.429 --> 14:49.514
Does a person
ever really know anyone?

14:49.556 --> 14:52.726
Uh, well, I'm not stupid.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.561
He is a good-looking man.

14:54.603 --> 14:56.980
And he's gone a lot,

14:57.022 --> 14:59.274
but we have a secret.

14:59.316 --> 15:00.942
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.736
We never lie to each other.

15:02.777 --> 15:05.739
Ever. No matter how hard it is
to hear the truth.

15:05.780 --> 15:09.993
It's our bond.

15:10.035 --> 15:13.330
And he's mine. I trust him.

15:14.873 --> 15:18.376
All right, ladies.

15:18.418 --> 15:22.297
(chuckles)
Ooh, I love this song.

15:22.339 --> 15:23.882
Russ, let's dance.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.133
Oh, uh...

15:25.175 --> 15:26.593
ALT-SMITH: No point resisting,
my friend, trust me.

15:26.635 --> 15:29.012
Come on, just one dance.

15:29.054 --> 15:30.221
So...

15:30.263 --> 15:32.641
guess that leaves us.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.896
What do you say, Miss Crain?

♪ Each time I see you again... ♪

15:39.981 --> 15:43.401

15:58.083 --> 16:00.293
Not a fan of country music?

16:00.335 --> 16:02.379
(chuckles)

16:02.420 --> 16:06.049
-Tell you the truth,
neither am I.
-(chuckles)

16:06.091 --> 16:08.426
When you're a New York City boy
in Virginia,

16:08.468 --> 16:09.886
you got to get used to it.

16:09.928 --> 16:14.265
Yeah? How is it that
you wound up here?

16:14.307 --> 16:16.726
Bailey's Crossroads?

16:16.768 --> 16:20.188
Yeah, this place, all of it,
a salesman, I don't know.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.399
-What is it you wanted?
-Um...

16:22.440 --> 16:24.693
Well, I guess
when I was younger,

16:24.734 --> 16:28.238
I wanted to be like my dad,
like most boys.

16:28.279 --> 16:31.658
Um, he was a... he was a banker,

16:31.700 --> 16:33.576
Wall Street.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.203
-Well, you're a smart guy.
-Well...

16:35.245 --> 16:36.579
looks can be deceiving.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.206
You could've been a banker,

16:38.248 --> 16:39.791
that's what I meant.

16:39.833 --> 16:43.920
Oh, it didn't end up so well.

16:43.962 --> 16:46.339
The Depression.

16:46.381 --> 16:50.510
And then with me, uh,
well, the war happened,

16:50.552 --> 16:54.931
and life kind of got in the way.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.349
Hm.

16:56.391 --> 16:59.352
As it does.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.396
Don't-don't get me wrong, huh?

17:01.438 --> 17:04.733
I count myself lucky,
for all of it.

17:04.774 --> 17:07.986
So, uh...

17:08.027 --> 17:11.448
tell me, Juliana,

17:11.489 --> 17:13.491
how'd you end up here?

17:13.533 --> 17:16.369
You were there,
don't you remember?

17:16.411 --> 17:19.247
-Before that.
-Mm.

17:19.289 --> 17:22.542
I'm sure Helen's told you.
Been through it with her.

17:22.584 --> 17:24.919
She told me that you, uh...
you don't remember

17:24.961 --> 17:28.840
anything about
what happened to you.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.383
That true?

17:30.425 --> 17:32.635
I remember.

17:34.679 --> 17:36.222
So you know where he is then,

17:36.264 --> 17:38.266
the man who shot you.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.730
Yes, I do.

17:45.982 --> 17:48.818
Why don't you tell someone?

17:48.860 --> 17:51.362
If only to stop him
from doing it to anyone else.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.655
Tell who?

17:52.697 --> 17:56.034
Well, the sheriff, or Helen.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.369
Me.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.497
I'll help you.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.006
Thanks for the dance, John.

18:10.048 --> 18:12.008
I think
I'm gonna call it a night.

18:12.050 --> 18:14.010
Hey, Russ, you mind giving me
a ride home, please?

18:14.052 --> 18:16.346
-Uh... (stammers) Sure.
-Already?

18:16.387 --> 18:18.348
Okay, well,
we'll see you all later.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.016
RUSS:

I'm not very good
at those things.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.996
(Russ sighs)

18:42.038 --> 18:43.748
So, uh,

18:43.790 --> 18:46.167
don't think you ever told me
where you're from.

18:46.209 --> 18:48.086

the closest thing I've had
to a home since then, so...

19:06.354 --> 19:08.314
Some of us were...

19:08.356 --> 19:10.567
kind of surprised
you decided to stay,

19:10.608 --> 19:12.151
considering, uh...

19:12.193 --> 19:14.571
I guess I just...

19:14.612 --> 19:18.825
I don't know, felt like maybe
I landed here for a reason.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.119
Well, maybe you did.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.788
(news theme playing)

19:23.830 --> 19:25.540
REPORTER:
Breaking news from Washington,

19:25.582 --> 19:28.001
right here on WKQN Richmond.

19:28.042 --> 19:29.836
Nobel Prize winner
Leo Zakarian,

19:29.878 --> 19:32.255
lead scientist of
the American nuclear program,

19:32.297 --> 19:34.299
has died unexpectedly.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.718
Dr. Zakarian,
only 50 years old,

19:36.759 --> 19:38.344
succumbed to a heart attack.

19:38.386 --> 19:39.929
President Johnson
called it a loss

19:39.971 --> 19:41.139
that will be felt for years

19:41.180 --> 19:42.891
in our nuclear program.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.101
And now back to our regularly
scheduled programming.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.437
(radio clicks off)

19:47.478 --> 19:49.856
It's no coincidence.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.482
RUSS:
Hmm?

19:51.524 --> 19:53.318
The death of the head
of the nuclear program.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.820
The failed launches.

19:55.862 --> 19:56.905
What do you mean?

19:56.946 --> 19:58.489
They're here.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.326
Trying to sabotage
the American defense program.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.828
Who?

20:03.870 --> 20:06.247
(exhales)

20:07.373 --> 20:10.168
You're a funny girl.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.212
You have no idea.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.305
The Black Communist Rebellion's
mission

20:22.347 --> 20:24.349
is self-defense
and self-determination

20:24.390 --> 20:26.351
for black people.

20:26.392 --> 20:29.854
I've got a network of fighters
waiting to be activated.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.065
We just need arms
to get back in the fight.

20:32.106 --> 20:34.400
We don't do business
with white people.

20:34.442 --> 20:37.987
Before I was in the JPS,
I was in the Reich.

20:38.029 --> 20:40.073
Before that,
Jim Crow Alabama.

20:40.114 --> 20:44.619
Everything changed for you
in '45, but not so much for us.

20:44.661 --> 20:48.331
We survive by trusting no one
outside our community.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.083
ELIJAH:
For all we know,
he could be a mole

20:50.124 --> 20:51.751
-for the Reich.
-LEM: Hold on.

20:51.793 --> 20:53.419
I can vouch for him, okay?

20:53.461 --> 20:55.546
He's the one
who spread the film everywhere.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.548
That film ain't nothing
but white nonsense, Lem.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.425
Have you seen it? Huh?

20:59.467 --> 21:01.427
It changes people's minds.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.554
It gets recruits.

21:03.596 --> 21:06.224
We're at war, brother. We ain't
got time for Abendsen's cult.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.434
I don't think you want to win.

21:08.476 --> 21:10.061
Oh, really?

21:10.103 --> 21:14.357
Yeah. I think you want to die
for a cause.

21:14.399 --> 21:15.858
I think you want to be martyrs.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.945
What makes you think
you know so much about us?

21:18.987 --> 21:21.155
Well,
'cause if you wanted to win,

21:21.197 --> 21:23.658
you'd be working with me.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.869
You give as good as you get,
English.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.371
I'm Irish.

21:28.413 --> 21:31.207
We know a thing or two
about raising hell.

21:31.249 --> 21:33.376
You lost Denver.

21:33.418 --> 21:35.795
You're the loser come asking.

21:35.837 --> 21:38.256
You're at war with one
superpower. You get your way,

21:38.297 --> 21:40.008
you'll be at war with another.

21:40.049 --> 21:42.343
So if I were you,

21:42.385 --> 21:45.304
I'd want as many allies
as I could get.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.856
Come on.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.374
Man, fuck that smuggler fool.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.376
He ain't nothing
but a two-bit hustler.

22:15.418 --> 22:16.919
I mean, we could use his network

22:16.961 --> 22:19.547
to get access
to some textbooks, penicillin...

22:19.589 --> 22:21.299
Equiano was clear on this.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.634
"The only hope for the survival
of black people

22:23.676 --> 22:25.887
is self-reliance."

22:25.928 --> 22:28.973
I've got a use for him.

22:32.894 --> 22:35.188
(sighs)

22:35.229 --> 22:38.608
Yukiko, I can't find
my cotton inspection...

22:38.649 --> 22:39.776
Here you are.

22:39.817 --> 22:41.736
...gloves.

22:44.197 --> 22:45.406
You read my mind.

22:46.449 --> 22:47.450
(thumps)

22:47.492 --> 22:49.327
Ah. Easy.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.745
Easy, gentlemen.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.163
You've got a treasure
in your hands.

22:52.205 --> 22:53.790
BELL:
Robert Childan,

22:53.831 --> 22:56.209
the antique dealer,
has ingratiated himself

22:56.250 --> 23:00.588
with some of the most powerful
people in Japanese society.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.632
They're going nuts
over American

23:02.673 --> 23:05.510
knickknacks and art coming out
of the Reich since Year Zero.

23:05.551 --> 23:08.387
Childan is holding an auction
of this junk

23:08.429 --> 23:10.306
in a couple of days
and General Masuda

23:10.348 --> 23:13.643
is coming from Tokyo for it.

23:13.684 --> 23:15.144
-The Butcher of Manchuria?
-Mm-hmm.

23:15.186 --> 23:17.355
-Fucking hell.
-Mm-hmm.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.898
He's coming to slaughter us,

23:18.940 --> 23:20.900
just like he did the Chinese.

23:20.942 --> 23:23.361
Testing grenades
and flamethrowers

23:23.402 --> 23:26.364
on civilians,
vivisection without anesthetic,

23:26.405 --> 23:28.157
biological experiments.

23:28.199 --> 23:30.993
Yeah. I'd say
you're a real threat to the JPS

23:31.035 --> 23:33.037
if they're sending Masuda.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.540
Masuda, Kido,

23:35.581 --> 23:38.292
and two defense ministers,
Shimura and Nagasaki,

23:38.334 --> 23:40.711
also from Tokyo, will be there.

23:40.753 --> 23:43.172
These are our targets.

23:48.052 --> 23:50.012
The auction's happening here,
in the Presidio.

23:50.054 --> 23:52.348
We'll secure the perimeter,

23:52.390 --> 23:53.766
cut their radio command,

23:53.808 --> 23:55.351
destroy
their communication lines,

23:55.393 --> 23:56.769
kill the guards.

23:56.811 --> 23:58.229
Your team...

23:59.772 --> 24:02.233
Your team will take out
the targets inside.

24:02.275 --> 24:05.027
What about civilians?

24:05.069 --> 24:06.779
There are no civilians.

24:06.821 --> 24:08.781
They all know, they all benefit.
No one's innocent.

24:08.823 --> 24:11.117
WYATT:
I see.

24:11.159 --> 24:12.910
Why hit them so publicly?

24:12.952 --> 24:15.955
This is the only time we know
these men will be together.

24:15.997 --> 24:19.083
If we take out Masuda and Kido,

24:19.125 --> 24:22.628
it puts fear in the hearts
of all Japanese.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.797
-What's the exit plan?
-With no phones or radios,

24:24.839 --> 24:27.175
it will take the Kempeitai
at least

24:27.216 --> 24:30.261
five minutes to get to the scene
once shooting starts.

24:30.303 --> 24:34.015
Your team has 90 seconds
to take out the targets.

24:34.056 --> 24:36.434
Exit the building, 30 seconds.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.562
We'll have vehicles waiting,
get in, drive off, 60 seconds.

24:39.604 --> 24:41.772
Two minutes to spare.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.233
(chuckles)
And what's keeping you

24:44.275 --> 24:46.277
from leaving us inside to die?

24:46.319 --> 24:47.862
You forget to kill a couple
guards and we're smoked.

24:47.904 --> 24:50.656
And you get to keep the weapons
as well.

24:50.698 --> 24:52.867
We honor our deals.

24:56.204 --> 24:57.997
How about...

24:58.039 --> 25:01.375
we stay on the outside and you
go in the building for the VIPs?

25:04.879 --> 25:07.673
You want the guns?

25:07.715 --> 25:09.675
(exhales)

25:09.717 --> 25:11.761
Come on.
It doesn't make sense.

25:11.802 --> 25:13.262
Why not hit the targets
yourself?

25:13.304 --> 25:15.848
We were planning to,
but we're boxed out.

25:15.890 --> 25:18.684
Blacks can't get
inside the auction.

25:18.726 --> 25:20.353
Too much heat
since Tagomi's murder.

25:20.394 --> 25:22.104
Yeah. Yeah.

25:22.146 --> 25:24.523
I guess I'll be on the outside
with the home team.

25:24.565 --> 25:25.691
No, I want you
with the armaments.

25:25.733 --> 25:28.027
-Yeah. Yeah.
-You don't mind, do you,

25:28.069 --> 25:31.197
if Lem goes with your guys
to get our truckload of weapons?

25:31.239 --> 25:34.408
'Cause no matter
what happens to us,

25:34.450 --> 25:37.495
our people get munitions.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.538
Agreed.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.374
All right.

25:41.415 --> 25:43.751
So what's the angle?

25:47.338 --> 25:48.714
So, you, uh...

25:48.756 --> 25:50.841
you do know
I already have a caterer.

25:50.883 --> 25:54.262
Well, we'd be willing
to undercut them by...

25:54.303 --> 25:55.930
20%.

26:00.935 --> 26:02.561
Mmm.

26:02.603 --> 26:04.272
Well,

26:04.313 --> 26:09.277
we are doing a Western theme
for our Americana auction,

26:09.318 --> 26:14.073
and barbecue would be pafekuto.

26:14.115 --> 26:17.076
But, um...

26:17.118 --> 26:19.662
serving staff needs
to speak Japanese,

26:19.704 --> 26:21.872
so... I'm sorry.

26:23.124 --> 26:26.335
I would be honored
to work for you, Mr. Childan.

26:32.341 --> 26:33.551
All right.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.969
License? Papers?

26:35.011 --> 26:37.179
-(door opens, bell tinkles)
-(clears throat)

26:37.221 --> 26:39.432
Everything is in order, sir.

26:39.473 --> 26:42.184
We'll do a real fine job
for you, Mr. Childan.

26:42.226 --> 26:45.313
Now, we're gonna need
to discuss this menu in detail.

26:45.354 --> 26:46.981
I'll want to sample every dish.

26:47.023 --> 26:48.774
Oh, yeah. We, um,
have 'em all right here, sir.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.360
(whispers indistinctly)

26:52.403 --> 26:53.487
What?

26:53.529 --> 26:55.823
Here?

26:55.865 --> 26:58.075
Right now?

26:59.744 --> 27:01.871
You need to go.
Leave, leave.

27:01.912 --> 27:04.123
-Uh, Yukiko, I need my tie.
-Hai.

27:04.165 --> 27:06.125
-Take your food with you.
-What about the coleslaw?
The mac and cheese is...

27:06.167 --> 27:07.626
And the chicken,
it falls off the bone.

27:07.668 --> 27:08.961
Leave the premises immediately.

27:09.003 --> 27:10.212
-But do we have the job, sir?
-Yes.

27:10.254 --> 27:11.547
Yes. Just come back later.

27:11.589 --> 27:13.174
Get out. Go.

27:13.215 --> 27:15.176
-Thank you, sir.
-You're welcome.

27:15.217 --> 27:16.802
You won't be disappointed, sir.

27:16.844 --> 27:18.804
-I really need you to leave.
-Okay.

27:18.846 --> 27:21.557
Yes. Thank you! Thank you.

27:21.599 --> 27:24.101
(panting)

27:25.102 --> 27:27.521
Ah.

27:29.106 --> 27:30.983
Oh. I can't believe
this is happening.

27:31.025 --> 27:32.985
Um...

27:33.027 --> 27:34.987
tell me what to do,
how to behave.

27:35.029 --> 27:36.614
Childan-san,

27:36.655 --> 27:39.367
you know exactly what to do.

27:39.408 --> 27:40.951
I do?

27:40.993 --> 27:43.037
Don't look her in the eyes

27:43.079 --> 27:45.706
unless she speaks to you
directly.

27:46.749 --> 27:47.792
Okay?

27:47.833 --> 27:49.543
Okay.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.962
(bell tinkles)

28:03.474 --> 28:05.726
(door closes)

28:05.768 --> 28:06.769
Uh...

28:06.811 --> 28:07.937
Welcome,
Your Imperial Majesty...

28:07.978 --> 28:08.938
Uh, uh...

28:08.979 --> 28:10.606
Your Imperial Highness, welcome.

28:10.648 --> 28:12.483
I am not worthy
of your presence.

28:12.525 --> 28:15.403
INOKUCHI: The crown princess
requests you show her

28:15.444 --> 28:18.239
the Remington
you will auction at the gala.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.950
Of course, Admiral Inokuchi.
It would be my honor.

28:20.991 --> 28:23.494
-(speaks Japanese)
-Will Ministers Shimura

28:23.536 --> 28:27.373
and Nagasaki
be attending the gala?

28:27.415 --> 28:29.625
Uh, yes, Admiral. They arrive
from Tokyo tonight, I believe.

28:32.169 --> 28:35.548
Shimura and Nagasaki
are confirmed.

28:35.589 --> 28:38.134
It will be good to have
our allies with us soon.

28:56.444 --> 28:58.237
Striking.

29:02.241 --> 29:05.119
It would be my profound honor
to gift you this painting,

29:05.161 --> 29:06.996
Your Imperial Highness.

29:08.164 --> 29:10.416
Very kind, but unnecessary.

29:10.458 --> 29:15.337
My assistant will attend
the auction later.

29:15.379 --> 29:17.006
He will then bid for it.

29:18.299 --> 29:20.718
What does this image
mean to you...

29:20.759 --> 29:22.303
Mr. Childan?

29:26.599 --> 29:29.185
We were a wild
and untamed place...

29:29.226 --> 29:32.354
before you came, Your Highness.

29:34.398 --> 29:39.361
In our culture,
horses are sacred intermediaries

29:39.403 --> 29:42.072
between our world

29:42.114 --> 29:44.074
and the world of the Kami.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.702
The divine spirits.

29:49.663 --> 29:51.999
You are a cultured man...

29:52.041 --> 29:53.542
Mr. Childan.

30:05.012 --> 30:07.014
(school bell rings)

30:07.056 --> 30:08.516
GIRL: Carried his books
for me last period...

30:08.557 --> 30:10.017
(three notes chime)

30:10.059 --> 30:11.435
WOMAN (over PA):
This is a reminder

30:11.477 --> 30:13.312
that the Hitler Youth
leadership meeting

30:13.354 --> 30:16.148
has been moved
from 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. tomorrow.

30:16.190 --> 30:17.775
And don't forget to get

30:17.816 --> 30:19.985
all your vaccines this fall.

30:20.027 --> 30:22.780
A healthy body is the key
to a bright future.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.698
The Reich is counting on you.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.700
(students chatting faintly)

30:39.797 --> 30:41.507
In Shakespeare's
Merchant of Venice,

30:41.549 --> 30:43.008
the principal antagonist

30:43.050 --> 30:44.927
is a merciless
Jewish moneylender

30:44.969 --> 30:46.762
whose name is Shylock.

30:46.804 --> 30:50.641
This man demands
a pound of flesh,

30:50.683 --> 30:54.144
actual human flesh...

30:54.186 --> 30:55.854
in exchange for a loan.

30:55.896 --> 30:57.106
(mouthing)

30:57.147 --> 31:00.317
With Shylock,
Shakespeare dramatizes

31:00.359 --> 31:02.194
the true nature of the Jew:

31:02.236 --> 31:04.905
evil, deceptive and greedy.

31:06.156 --> 31:08.075
Yes, Tracy?

31:08.117 --> 31:09.868
I notice Shylock says,

31:09.910 --> 31:12.371
"If prick me, do I not bleed?"

31:12.413 --> 31:13.956
Yes, and?

31:13.998 --> 31:16.417
Is the writer saying
Jews are human?

31:18.711 --> 31:20.671
I never thought of it that way.

31:20.713 --> 31:22.256
We shouldn't be studying this.

31:28.637 --> 31:31.098
Thank you for...
that correction, Tracy.

31:31.140 --> 31:33.434
I believe you're right.

31:33.475 --> 31:35.436
I will take this up

31:35.477 --> 31:38.272
at our next faculty meeting
and we will sort this out.

31:39.315 --> 31:41.400
Yes, we will.

31:41.442 --> 31:43.652
Let's move on to mathematics.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.752
(fire crackling)

32:03.088 --> 32:05.007
I still don't get it.

32:09.553 --> 32:11.930
Both sides have to equal zero.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.849
How'd you get that?

32:13.891 --> 32:15.184
Didn't you study
the quadratic equation

32:15.225 --> 32:16.477
in your school in Chicago?

32:16.518 --> 32:19.188
I had to miss a lot of class.

32:21.231 --> 32:22.941
Should we start from the top?

32:28.155 --> 32:30.157
I missed you.

32:41.543 --> 32:43.379
I wasn't in Chicago.

32:44.421 --> 32:46.924
Were you outside of the Reich?

32:48.467 --> 32:50.427
I'd just assumed, 'cause...

32:50.469 --> 32:52.096
you didn't know
about the armbands.

32:52.137 --> 32:53.514
So...

32:57.976 --> 33:00.187
It's so weird that our teachers
are scared of us.

33:00.229 --> 33:03.232
Are kids actually ratting
on their parents?

33:03.273 --> 33:05.693
Some, yeah.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.069
Most of us just kind of...

33:07.111 --> 33:08.737
pretend to go along
with it, though.

33:09.780 --> 33:11.532
I don't like it.

33:11.573 --> 33:14.368
Me, neither.

33:22.376 --> 33:24.128

34:39.703 --> 34:40.913
-Don't you dare!
-Telling my teacher!

34:40.954 --> 34:42.956
-Amy, no!
-Look, I'm telling!

34:42.998 --> 34:44.958
You little brat!

34:45.000 --> 34:46.418
-AMY: It's not yours!
-JENNIFER: Yes, it is!

34:46.460 --> 34:47.711
(Amy shouting)

34:47.753 --> 34:49.004
Whatever, give it to me!

34:49.046 --> 34:50.339
Give it back, you little brat!

34:50.380 --> 34:52.174
(grunts)

34:52.216 --> 34:53.759
JENNIFER:
Open the door!

34:53.801 --> 34:55.928
-(elevator dings)
-AMY: I'm gonna inform on you!

34:55.969 --> 34:58.555
-(gasps)
-AMY: Dad is gonna be so angry.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.390
-He's gonna kill you.
-Amy, give me back
the record now.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.935
-What's going on?
-I don't know, sir.

35:02.976 --> 35:04.770
JENNIFER:
...it's gonna be your fault.

35:04.812 --> 35:06.188
-Shut up and open the door.
-AMY: This is a crime

35:06.230 --> 35:07.856
and you're gonna pay for it!

35:07.898 --> 35:10.317
You're a race traitor
and I'm gonna tell Dad

35:10.359 --> 35:11.902
-that you like black...
-Amy, open the door.

35:14.988 --> 35:16.281
What's going on here?

35:16.323 --> 35:17.783
Jennifer was listening
to this record.

35:17.825 --> 35:19.993
She brought it
from the Neutral Zone.

35:20.035 --> 35:21.578
She was close-dancing
with Henry Iver.

35:21.620 --> 35:22.830
They were all over each other.

35:22.871 --> 35:24.665
-We were not.
-SMITH: Jennifer.

35:24.706 --> 35:26.124
Wait in my office.

35:31.421 --> 35:33.882
AMY: It's one of those kind
of records, Daddy.

35:33.924 --> 35:35.801
She brought it
from the Neutral Zone.

35:35.843 --> 35:38.887
-She listens to
resistance radio every night.
-Calm down.

35:38.929 --> 35:42.599
They told us in school today we
have to inform on bad behavior.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.226
Even in our own families.
We have to.

35:44.268 --> 35:48.021
Well, now you're informing me.

35:48.063 --> 35:50.315
-Does that count?
-Yes.

35:50.357 --> 35:52.693
So you've done your job.

35:52.734 --> 35:55.028
The real mistake here is mine.

35:56.530 --> 35:58.198
But you didn't do
anything wrong.

36:00.033 --> 36:01.994
It's my record.

36:02.035 --> 36:04.329
It's evidence in a...

36:04.371 --> 36:06.707
in a case the Gestapo
is pursuing.

36:06.748 --> 36:08.041
It's yours?

36:08.083 --> 36:09.585
It is.

36:09.626 --> 36:11.420
-(sighs)
-I thought she

36:11.461 --> 36:12.796
brought it
from the Neutral Zone.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.882
That is why we need
to be very careful

36:14.923 --> 36:18.677
about making accusations, honey.

36:18.719 --> 36:21.555
Especially against
people we love.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.187
(footsteps approaching)

36:35.193 --> 36:37.070
(sighs heavily)

36:41.450 --> 36:42.784
(sighs)

36:47.581 --> 36:51.877
Have you any idea...
how dangerous this is?

36:51.919 --> 36:53.879
It's just music.
What's the big deal?

36:53.921 --> 36:55.714
You know the answer to that.

36:55.756 --> 36:58.133
We cannot have this

36:58.175 --> 37:00.177
-in our family.
-What do you mean

37:00.218 --> 37:03.847
-by "our family"?
-You know exactly what I mean!

37:08.185 --> 37:10.187
(sighs)

37:10.228 --> 37:13.148
-(throws record down)
-This is all my fault.

37:13.190 --> 37:15.817
Shouldn't have let you
stay out there

37:15.859 --> 37:18.111
-all that time.
-Dad.

37:18.153 --> 37:19.571
(exhales)

37:21.865 --> 37:25.077
Listen, I know, uh...

37:25.118 --> 37:28.830
I know you
probably heard things...

37:28.872 --> 37:31.375
when you were
in the Neutral Zone.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.627
Huh? On the radio.

37:34.962 --> 37:36.463
It's not true.

37:36.505 --> 37:38.632
Whatever you heard there,

37:38.674 --> 37:40.634
it's a lie.

37:43.303 --> 37:44.763
Okay?

37:50.227 --> 37:52.270
The rules are different here.

37:52.312 --> 37:54.356
You know that.

37:54.398 --> 37:56.608
And there's things that...

37:58.735 --> 38:01.863
...that even I
can't protect you from.

38:05.492 --> 38:08.120
(helicopter blades whirring
in distance)

38:26.972 --> 38:29.099
(door creaks shut in distance)

38:54.708 --> 38:56.918
(insects trilling)

39:00.922 --> 39:02.049
JENNIFER:
Mom?

39:02.090 --> 39:05.052
Jenny, my darling. Hi.

39:05.093 --> 39:07.012
(Jenny sobbing)

39:07.054 --> 39:09.514
Mom...

39:09.556 --> 39:10.932
HELEN:
Hey.

39:12.601 --> 39:15.187
-Hey, what's wrong?
-I want to go back to the farm.

39:15.228 --> 39:17.105
I want to be with you.

39:17.147 --> 39:18.732
There's a bus--
I looked it up.

39:18.774 --> 39:20.192
No, you can't do that.

39:20.233 --> 39:21.860
Sweetheart, it's too dangerous.

39:21.902 --> 39:24.321
Please, Mom,
I can't take it here.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.448
-(sobbing continues)
-What's happened, baby?

39:26.490 --> 39:28.325
I don't belong here, Mom.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.911
-Just, please...
-We're gonna get through this.

39:30.952 --> 39:32.537
Okay?

39:32.579 --> 39:35.415
I want to live with you.
I-I hate it here.

39:35.457 --> 39:37.459
I can't stay here.

39:37.501 --> 39:38.835
Please.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.046
-(sobbing)
-Okay, you be strong

39:41.088 --> 39:42.589
for me, okay?

39:42.631 --> 39:44.174
I miss you, Mom.

39:44.216 --> 39:46.676
I love you with all my heart.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.720
(sobbing)

40:02.984 --> 40:06.863
I assume you have finished your
investigation, Inspector Kido.

40:06.905 --> 40:10.200
Unfortunately, Mingus Jones died
during his interrogation.

40:10.242 --> 40:11.827
That is disappointing.

40:11.868 --> 40:14.454
No matter. The evidence
against him is overwhelming.

40:14.496 --> 40:17.040
And I will continue to search
for his coconspirators.

40:17.082 --> 40:19.042
I want this concluded, Kido.

40:19.084 --> 40:22.254
Tomorrow, a photo
of the assassin Mingus Jones

40:22.295 --> 40:23.630
will appear in the newspaper

40:23.672 --> 40:25.423
next to the officers
who arrested him.

40:25.465 --> 40:27.634
Yes, General.
We are still investigating.

40:27.676 --> 40:29.594
I want the people
of San Francisco

40:29.636 --> 40:32.347
and our leaders in Tokyo to know
the Kempeitai have solved

40:32.389 --> 40:33.765
the murder of Tagomi.

40:33.807 --> 40:35.016
End of story.

40:35.058 --> 40:36.893
Hai, Kakka.

40:36.935 --> 40:38.603
Eyes are on us, Kido.

40:38.645 --> 40:40.939
We are sending Masuda.

40:40.981 --> 40:43.316
We must exhibit iron control.

40:44.359 --> 40:46.069
No mistakes.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.029
Of any kind.

41:23.523 --> 41:25.984
(takes deep breath)

41:31.656 --> 41:34.034
(faint distorted screams,
gunshots)

41:36.745 --> 41:40.207
(distorted screams,
gunfire growing louder)

41:43.919 --> 41:47.505
(distorted screams,
gunfire booming)

41:51.676 --> 41:53.094

stop abruptly)

42:15.242 --> 42:16.660
...Colonel Kido.

42:16.701 --> 42:19.329
General Yamori requested me
to escort you

42:19.371 --> 42:20.789
through our preparations.

42:20.830 --> 42:22.582
Tomaré.

42:22.624 --> 42:24.000
Stop!

42:25.669 --> 42:28.588
We'll stop, all right?
Happy to take a break.

42:28.630 --> 42:30.215
This thing is heavy.

42:31.091 --> 42:33.009
Take it apart.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.386
He wants them to take it apart.

42:34.427 --> 42:36.388
-No, that's...
-CHILDAN: Excuse me.

42:36.429 --> 42:38.515
Chief Inspector Kido-san?

42:38.556 --> 42:41.309
Chief Inspector Kido-san, uh...

42:41.351 --> 42:42.310
welcome.

42:42.352 --> 42:43.895
Uh, forgive me, but this is

42:43.937 --> 42:47.148
a traditional American barbecue.

42:47.190 --> 42:48.942
It's welded together.
It's-it's impossible

42:48.984 --> 42:50.318
to take it apart.

42:50.944 --> 42:52.404
Open it.

42:52.445 --> 42:54.114
(man speaks Japanese)

43:02.831 --> 43:04.291
CHILDAN:
Allow me to, uh,

43:04.332 --> 43:06.251
congratulate you
for the efficient solving

43:06.293 --> 43:09.087
of the murder
of Minister Tagomi, sir.

43:11.673 --> 43:13.842
Show me the inside of the house.

43:24.561 --> 43:27.147
So, this is a reception area,

43:27.188 --> 43:30.108
and as you can see,
we have a Western theme.

43:30.150 --> 43:32.110
I want armed guards
in every room.

43:32.152 --> 43:34.112
Is that really necessary?

43:34.154 --> 43:36.323
It kind of...
dampens the ambience.

43:36.364 --> 43:37.615
Perhaps...

43:37.657 --> 43:39.200
Already taken care of.

43:40.660 --> 43:44.497
Uh, through here, uh,

43:44.539 --> 43:48.335
everyone will be able to examine

43:48.376 --> 43:50.837
the, uh, art and antiquities.

43:53.590 --> 43:55.592
What is this worth?

43:55.633 --> 43:59.888
Oh, this, it's extremely rare.

43:59.929 --> 44:02.265
Extremely collectible.

44:02.307 --> 44:04.225
It's a precious totem

44:04.267 --> 44:07.312

Do you want to show her?
-Yeah, no problem.

44:31.753 --> 44:32.796
WYATT:
Stuff for me over here, sir.

44:32.837 --> 44:34.172
Thank you.

44:34.214 --> 44:36.758
You should have Japanese
handling the food.

44:36.800 --> 44:39.052
I led the
Battle of Badung Strait,

44:39.094 --> 44:42.055
I think I can manage a party.

44:42.097 --> 44:44.182
Protecting our citizens

44:57.070 --> 44:58.655

45:02.742 --> 45:04.953
That meat goes in the cooler.

45:04.994 --> 45:06.955
I'll show 'em.

45:11.251 --> 45:12.961
Oh. I got it.

45:16.089 --> 45:17.424
A message for you, sir.

45:17.465 --> 45:18.967
What is this?

45:19.008 --> 45:20.510
From Tokkô headquarters.

45:20.552 --> 45:25.098
You son did not appear
for his job interview today.

45:30.937 --> 45:34.691
Make him taste everything
before it is served.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.734
(indistinct chatter continues)

45:47.704 --> 45:49.664
Toru.

46:00.008 --> 46:01.301
Are you okay?

46:10.852 --> 46:12.479
Where were you today?

46:14.397 --> 46:16.608
(sighs)

46:16.649 --> 46:20.737
I told the Tokkô secretary
she was mistaken.

46:20.778 --> 46:23.531
Your interview is scheduled
for tomorrow.

46:38.421 --> 46:42.342
Why did you not appear
for your interview?

46:44.219 --> 46:47.972
Forgive me. Please.

46:48.014 --> 46:50.016
I was not well.

46:50.058 --> 46:52.644
What does that mean?

46:55.313 --> 46:58.107
I did not have the strength.

46:59.943 --> 47:03.154
A weak man...

47:03.196 --> 47:06.449
would not have earned
the Kinshi Kunsho.

47:06.491 --> 47:08.952
You fought bravely in Manchuria.

47:08.993 --> 47:13.748
You will wear your medal
tomorrow for the interview.

47:32.642 --> 47:35.895
And all will be
as it should be.

47:47.365 --> 47:48.825
YUKIKO:
We have checked

47:48.866 --> 47:51.828
every detail many times.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.455
Rest now for tomorrow.

48:04.340 --> 48:06.342
(exhales sharply)

48:16.728 --> 48:19.731
You know,
when the occupation started,

48:19.772 --> 48:24.527
uh, there were mass executions.

48:26.237 --> 48:30.992
And I was too frightened
to leave my room.

48:31.034 --> 48:35.747
So I hid... for weeks.

48:35.788 --> 48:38.458
Weeks.

48:38.499 --> 48:40.793
There was no electricity, and...

48:40.835 --> 48:43.630
I was so hungry that I...

48:43.671 --> 48:46.466
ate mice.

48:46.507 --> 48:51.137
Burned books to stay warm.

48:51.179 --> 48:54.015
And yesterday...

48:56.976 --> 49:01.898
...the crown princess graced me
with her presence...

49:04.233 --> 49:06.778
...in my shop.

49:06.819 --> 49:09.906
I barely recognize myself.

49:09.947 --> 49:11.949
Crown princess graced you

49:11.991 --> 49:14.327
with more than her presence,
Childan-san.

49:14.369 --> 49:16.871
She spoke personally with you,

49:16.913 --> 49:19.457
as a man of elevated status.

49:22.627 --> 49:25.171
May I offer you tea?

49:26.547 --> 49:28.132
Are you sure?

49:28.174 --> 49:29.676
Yes.

49:29.717 --> 49:33.137
You are a man of honor.

49:33.179 --> 49:37.016
Oh, I would love tea,
Yukiko.

49:37.058 --> 49:38.643
(laughs) Okay.

50:47.587 --> 50:52.300
I am pleased to offer myself in
service to your important work.

50:52.341 --> 50:56.345
I, too, am honored.

50:56.387 --> 50:59.265
(chuckles)
Childan-san.

51:00.600 --> 51:02.477
Please call me Robert.

51:05.605 --> 51:07.482

51:07.523 --> 51:08.816
Oh, God.

51:08.858 --> 51:11.110
ELIJAH:
Oh, that feels so good.

51:11.152 --> 51:13.321
Oh, yeah.

51:13.362 --> 51:14.989
-Here we go.
-(grunts)

51:15.031 --> 51:16.491
You're amazing.

51:16.532 --> 51:19.452
NEIGHBOR:
Shut the hell up!

51:19.494 --> 51:21.496
Hold on now!
We're almost done!

51:21.537 --> 51:22.872
(laughing):
Oh, no.

51:22.914 --> 51:25.249
No, we are not!

51:25.291 --> 51:27.752

51:27.794 --> 51:29.295
ELIJAH:
Don't stop, don't...

51:32.215 --> 51:35.760
(breathes deeply)

51:35.802 --> 51:39.305
I can't wait to get out
of this tenement.

51:40.848 --> 51:44.727
Get a place of our own.

51:44.769 --> 51:47.396
We gotta get past tomorrow
first.

51:47.438 --> 51:49.440
It's locked in.

51:51.317 --> 51:53.569
(Elijah sighs)

51:53.611 --> 51:56.072
I don't dig relying
on white boys.

51:56.113 --> 51:59.116
I don't want to talk
about that right now.

52:02.119 --> 52:06.624
I just want to dream...
for a minute...

52:08.417 --> 52:11.003
...about a place of our own.

52:11.045 --> 52:13.714
Away from all this.

52:14.924 --> 52:17.051
(indistinct chatter in distance)

52:17.093 --> 52:20.054
Okay.

52:22.348 --> 52:26.936
I have this... this picture
in the back of my mind:

52:26.978 --> 52:29.814
a blue house...

52:29.856 --> 52:33.818
with red roses.

52:33.860 --> 52:36.571
-A blue house?
-(laughs)

52:36.612 --> 52:40.157
Yeah. Dark blue.

52:43.536 --> 52:45.621
We'll have a vegetable garden.

52:46.998 --> 52:48.583
Some kids around.

52:48.624 --> 52:50.126
Okay. Okay.

52:50.167 --> 52:52.378
C-Can I just remind you
that we're communists?

52:52.420 --> 52:54.839
Okay? Before you get
too carried away

52:54.881 --> 52:56.299
with all that property talk?

52:56.340 --> 52:57.592
I know. I know.

52:57.633 --> 52:59.218
I know. I know. I know.

52:59.260 --> 53:01.762
(both chuckle)

53:01.804 --> 53:04.765
We ain't gonna have
no kids anyway.

53:11.272 --> 53:13.274
I-I'm-I'm sorry, babe.
I'm sorry.

53:13.316 --> 53:15.526
I-It's just...

53:15.568 --> 53:17.737
We can't be living
in a dreamworld, babe.

53:17.778 --> 53:19.906
That's okay.

53:19.947 --> 53:22.325
I know I can't have kids.

53:22.366 --> 53:25.745
Doesn't mean there can't
be kids around.

53:25.786 --> 53:28.372
Sure enough.

53:34.378 --> 53:36.255
Tomorrow's going off
like a charm.

53:36.297 --> 53:39.800
We are going to shake up
the JPS, and eventually...

53:39.842 --> 53:41.844
get a place of our own.

53:41.886 --> 53:43.930
That is not a dreamworld.

53:47.850 --> 53:49.852
If you say so.

53:52.355 --> 53:54.690
I do.

-It's a school night, honey.

Come on.

55:18.482 --> 55:22.111
I'm kind of surprised
you-you wanted Alice.

55:22.153 --> 55:24.780
I thought you'd outgrown her.

55:24.822 --> 55:26.866
I missed you, Daddy.

55:26.907 --> 55:29.201
I missed you, too, honey.

55:29.243 --> 55:31.454
Go to sleep.
See you in the morning.

55:31.495 --> 55:32.747
Daddy.

Were there black people here
when you were a kid?

55:38.669 --> 55:40.921
Uh...

55:40.963 --> 55:45.176
Yes, there were black people
when I was growing up. Why?

55:45.217 --> 55:46.552
I just wondered
what it was like.

55:46.594 --> 55:48.596
Did you play with them?

55:50.598 --> 55:53.768
SMITH:
Not really, but, uh,
I knew them.

55:53.809 --> 55:56.812
Did you like them?

55:56.854 --> 55:59.648
SMITH:
I didn't know them well.

55:59.690 --> 56:02.193
Why are there no black people
here anymore?

56:02.234 --> 56:05.321
Well, what did they teach you
at school?

56:05.362 --> 56:08.032
They've gone back
to their homeland, Africa.

56:08.074 --> 56:09.617
They're working for the Reich.

56:09.658 --> 56:11.410
Well, there's your answer.

56:11.452 --> 56:12.787
AMY:
But why?

56:12.828 --> 56:14.872
Why can't they live here?

56:14.914 --> 56:16.332
SMITH:
Eh, they like it there.

56:16.373 --> 56:18.167
I mean, i-it's better.

56:18.209 --> 56:21.879
I saw black people
in the Neutral Zone.

56:23.380 --> 56:24.882
It was a little scary.

56:24.924 --> 56:26.425
SMITH:
Well, you're home and safe now

56:26.467 --> 56:28.135
and this is where
you're gonna stay, okay?

56:28.177 --> 56:29.428
Sleep well.

56:29.470 --> 56:32.389
-See you in the morning.
-Okay.

56:39.313 --> 56:41.398
Okay, lights out, Jennifer.

56:43.901 --> 56:46.112
It's not true.

56:46.153 --> 56:48.239
What you told her.

57:01.043 --> 57:03.462
We'll talk about it
another time.

57:04.463 --> 57:05.589
(door closes)

57:13.430 --> 57:15.391
(car door closes)

57:15.432 --> 57:17.101
(dog barking)

57:24.900 --> 57:26.902
(dog continues barking)

57:50.342 --> 57:53.095
(car engine starts)
