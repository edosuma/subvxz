14:10.795 --> 14:13.795
- Moment?
- A moment.

14:14.378 --> 14:15.629
When you realize,

14:15.712 --> 14:18.295
"Oh shit, I'm in love."

14:19.378 --> 14:21.545
For example, I'm looking at you,

14:21.629 --> 14:23.337
hiding behind your mask,

14:23.420 --> 14:26.712
and I'm having the opposite
of that moment.

14:39.961 --> 14:43.128
Hmm. You might be
pretty good-looking

14:43.211 --> 14:45.462
if you didn't cover
yourself in blue makeup.

14:45.961 --> 14:47.211
It's not makeup.

14:47.295 --> 14:49.795
- You're naturally blue.
- That's right.

14:51.295 --> 14:53.712
I thought Dr. Manhattan glows.

14:53.795 --> 14:55.295
I could if I wanted to,

14:55.378 --> 14:57.211
but it would attract
too much attention.

14:57.295 --> 15:01.003
Come on. Nobody in here
is gonna notice.

15:01.086 --> 15:02.337
Just glow a little bit.

15:02.420 --> 15:04.587
I'd rather you remain unsure

15:04.670 --> 15:07.587
before you agree to have
dinner with me tomorrow night.

15:07.670 --> 15:09.003
My blue friend,

15:09.086 --> 15:12.170
you think you may
know all about me,

15:12.253 --> 15:16.128
but you have made a critical
error in your approach.

15:17.128 --> 15:18.795
I hate Dr. Manhattan.

15:19.795 --> 15:20.961
Why?

15:21.670 --> 15:23.420
Forty years ago,

15:23.503 --> 15:25.378
Nixon comes to Big Blue,

15:25.462 --> 15:27.754
asks him to go to Vietnam.

15:27.837 --> 15:30.920
Manhattan goes, 100 feet tall.

15:31.003 --> 15:34.295
Torches the Vietcong
with lasers from his hands.

15:35.670 --> 15:38.587
A little boy watches
his village burn.

15:38.670 --> 15:40.045
Boy grows up,

15:40.128 --> 15:43.295
becomes a puppeteer because
he wants to hold the strings.

15:43.378 --> 15:47.086
He makes a bomb.
That bomb kills my parents

15:47.170 --> 15:50.337
22 years ago tonight.

15:50.420 --> 15:52.670
Tonight is...

15:52.754 --> 15:55.003
the anniversary
of your parents' death?

15:55.545 --> 15:59.211
You knew that.
You said it
before you sat down.

15:59.295 --> 16:03.003
Yes, but you just told me now.

16:03.503 --> 16:04.920
As for Vietnam,

16:05.003 --> 16:07.462
I was trying to be what
people wanted me to be.

16:07.545 --> 16:10.420
A soldier, superhero, a savior.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.128
I tried to do
the right thing, and...

16:12.211 --> 16:15.128
if it's any consolation,
I do regret it.

16:15.211 --> 16:17.086
Aha.

16:17.170 --> 16:20.045
Then you must've known that
you would end up regretting it

16:20.128 --> 16:23.170
before you did it.
So, why do it anyway?

16:23.253 --> 16:25.879
Haven't you ever done anything
you knew you were gonna regret?

16:27.003 --> 16:28.211
Maybe.

16:28.295 --> 16:30.670
Then will you have dinner
with me tomorrow night?

16:31.879 --> 16:35.253
Well, you know everything
that's gonna happen.

16:35.337 --> 16:37.128
Am I having dinner
with you tomorrow night?

16:37.211 --> 16:39.795
- Yes.
- Incorrect.

16:39.879 --> 16:42.045
Tonight, you fit in
with all the other

16:42.128 --> 16:45.503
drunk Manhattan wannabes,
stumbling around for VVN.

16:45.587 --> 16:49.253
But tomorrow,
you're gonna stick out
like a sore blue thumb.

16:49.337 --> 16:51.086
If I walk into
a restaurant with you,

16:51.170 --> 16:52.503
people are gonna stare, man.

16:52.587 --> 16:55.879
Why go to a restaurant when
I can teleport you anywhere?

16:55.961 --> 16:58.712
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That sounds great.

16:58.795 --> 17:02.754
But eventually,
we're gonna have
to go out, in public.

17:04.337 --> 17:06.462
So, how you gonna pull
that off, Doc?

17:06.961 --> 17:10.295
Dr. Manhattan:
Actually, you've come up
with a rather elegant solution

17:10.378 --> 17:12.545
to the problem of my appearance.

17:12.961 --> 17:15.378
- Have I?
- Yes.

17:16.086 --> 17:18.712
You're explaining
it to me right now.

17:18.795 --> 17:20.211
Actually, for you...

17:22.587 --> 17:24.754
two weeks from right now.

17:25.462 --> 17:27.545
Dao Van Noi. 26.

17:27.629 --> 17:30.961
Accidental gas leak.
No next of kin.

17:41.337 --> 17:44.378
Michael Declan. Age 36.

17:44.462 --> 17:47.754
Heroin overdose.
No next of kin.

17:54.795 --> 17:57.211
William Heath. Age 33.

17:57.295 --> 17:59.920
Killed himself.
No next of kin.

18:00.003 --> 18:02.795
Lived alone, died alone,

18:02.879 --> 18:04.545
and in 48 hours,

18:04.629 --> 18:06.837
they're all gonna be cremated.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.337
Ashes floating over Saigon.

18:10.503 --> 18:12.128
Pick one.

18:12.503 --> 18:15.420
I could actually look like
anyone you want, Angela.

18:15.503 --> 18:18.253
Why limit it to just these men?

18:18.337 --> 18:20.337
Because they're real.

18:20.420 --> 18:23.086
They have birth certificates,
Social Security numbers,

18:23.170 --> 18:25.253
passports,
everything that you need

18:25.337 --> 18:28.337
to exist in this world, so pick.

18:28.420 --> 18:30.712
I don't care what I look like.

18:30.795 --> 18:32.253
Whatever form I take is the one

18:32.337 --> 18:34.337
you should be comfortable with.

18:34.420 --> 18:36.670
Well, I don't care either.

18:36.754 --> 18:40.128
Then, you should have no problem
choosing one of these men.

18:41.128 --> 18:43.961
Unless, for some reason,
you have yet to...

18:44.045 --> 18:45.837
present all of the options.

19:06.045 --> 19:08.086
His name is Calvin Jelani.

19:08.170 --> 19:10.462
He just dropped dead.

19:10.545 --> 19:13.587
Probably a heart attack.

19:13.670 --> 19:18.837
There's no family to pay
for an autopsy, so...

19:18.920 --> 19:21.670
Dr. Manhattan:
Ashes over Saigon.

19:24.170 --> 19:26.670
I'd be comfortable with him.

19:33.420 --> 19:35.503
I like the name.

19:35.587 --> 19:37.211
Calvin.

19:42.587 --> 19:45.712
♪ ♪

19:52.420 --> 19:53.795
What do you think?

19:55.378 --> 19:57.754
You sound different.

19:58.587 --> 20:01.879
My vocal cords loosened
in the transformation.

20:02.629 --> 20:05.920
- Shall I adjust them back?
- No! Uh, I'm good.

20:24.545 --> 20:26.128
You...

20:26.712 --> 20:29.337
forgot your thing.

20:30.503 --> 20:33.670
I'm going to forget
so much more.

20:35.295 --> 20:37.629
A conversation for another time.

20:45.545 --> 20:48.378
- I have an elegant solution?
- Yes.

20:48.462 --> 20:50.003
Okay, what is it?

20:50.086 --> 20:52.211
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

20:52.295 --> 20:53.879
Because then
it won't be your idea.

20:53.961 --> 20:57.420
Man, you have got
this shit down.

20:57.503 --> 20:59.920
- Thank you.
- So, you can see the future,

21:00.003 --> 21:01.629
but you just won't tell me
about it.

21:01.712 --> 21:05.337
Dr. Manhattan:
I'm not seeing the future,
I'm experiencing it.

21:05.420 --> 21:07.754
Uh-huh. And you're
experiencing tomorrow night,

21:07.837 --> 21:10.045
- and you and me
are having dinner?
- Right.

21:10.128 --> 21:11.879
Wrong.

21:11.961 --> 21:13.837
But I'll play.

21:13.920 --> 21:16.754
So, after dinner,

21:16.837 --> 21:19.086
- how long are we together?
- Ten years.

21:19.170 --> 21:21.795
Hmm, that seems manageable.
I'll still be young.

21:21.879 --> 21:24.712
I can fall in love again.
How does it end?

21:25.128 --> 21:26.545
Dr. Manhattan:
Tragically.

21:27.128 --> 21:29.337
You wanna be
a little more specific?

21:30.003 --> 21:31.462
Dr. Manhattan:
I'd rather not.

21:32.003 --> 21:34.253
So, 10 years, tragic ending,

21:34.337 --> 21:36.754
I can roll with that.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.253
But I'm still not convinced.

21:38.337 --> 21:39.629
Dr. Manhattan:
Convinced of what?

21:39.712 --> 21:42.337
That you know
what's gonna happen next.

21:42.420 --> 21:46.211
Dr. Manhattan:
Your favorite song is
about to play on the jukebox,

21:47.086 --> 21:48.961
right... now.

21:58.170 --> 22:01.003
Oh my God. Holy shit.

22:01.086 --> 22:02.629
♪ The tunnel,
the tunnel with you... ♪

22:02.712 --> 22:04.712
I have never even heard
this song before.

22:04.795 --> 22:08.211
Dr. Manhattan:
It's called "Tunnel of Love,"
and now it's your favorite.

22:08.295 --> 22:10.420
Wow.

22:11.045 --> 22:13.712
You don't know shit
about the future.

22:15.211 --> 22:17.045
But you are funny.

22:17.128 --> 22:20.170
Dr. Manhattan:
You find it amusing now,
but in six months,

22:20.253 --> 22:21.933
it's the reason
you're telling me to leave.

22:21.961 --> 22:25.211
- I thought we were
together 10 years.
- We are.

22:25.295 --> 22:26.961
Then, what happens
in six months?

22:27.045 --> 22:29.104
Dr. Manhattan:
It's happening right now.
We're making love.

22:29.128 --> 22:32.754
Hmm. It doesn't sound like
I'm telling you to leave.

22:32.837 --> 22:34.503
Not yet.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.211
Right now,
you're asking where I am.

22:36.295 --> 22:39.629
Where are you?

22:40.545 --> 22:41.795
Cal:
I'm in the bar...

22:43.754 --> 22:46.795
the night we met.

22:46.879 --> 22:48.795
Just before I created the egg.

22:50.754 --> 22:52.674
I'm telling you about
the fight we're gonna have.

22:52.754 --> 22:55.378
- Shut up.
- That you're telling
me to leave.

22:55.462 --> 22:57.879
- Angela:
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
- All right.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.253
God damn it.

23:05.670 --> 23:07.587
We are not gonna fight

23:07.670 --> 23:10.211
because I'm not gonna
tell you to leave.

23:10.295 --> 23:12.754
We are and...

23:13.795 --> 23:15.837
you will.

23:15.920 --> 23:18.253
I'm sorry, but it's
already occurring.

23:18.337 --> 23:19.837
- Do you wanna fight?
- No,

23:19.920 --> 23:22.378
but the fight will still
happen regardless of my intent.

23:22.462 --> 23:25.045
Not if we don't let it.

23:25.128 --> 23:27.045
You knew this about me.

23:27.128 --> 23:29.545
Who I am, how I perceive things.

23:29.629 --> 23:31.462
I told you the very
first night we met,

23:31.545 --> 23:33.378
knowing that it would
lead to this argument.

23:33.462 --> 23:36.378
- We are not in an argument.
- We're close.

23:36.462 --> 23:37.879
And now, you say...

23:37.961 --> 23:41.253
Both:
Don't tell me what
I'm gonna fucking say!

23:43.670 --> 23:45.629
This is not fair.

23:46.629 --> 23:48.045
If we're not gonna be together,

23:48.128 --> 23:50.211
then why are we even
fucking together?

23:50.295 --> 23:51.629
It makes no sense.

23:51.712 --> 23:54.045
Until now, my ability
to know the future

23:54.128 --> 23:56.587
was immensely reassuring to you.

23:56.670 --> 23:59.086
It gave you a sense
of safety and stability

23:59.170 --> 24:01.010
that you never had
growing up in the orphanage.

24:01.086 --> 24:04.587
-Uh-uh.
-Was your childhood not
filled with the constant fear

24:04.670 --> 24:06.688
- that you would
never have a family?
- Don't you dare...

24:06.712 --> 24:09.128
- Because yours was
taken away from you?
- Stop!

24:09.961 --> 24:12.003
We're in the fight now.

24:12.462 --> 24:14.712
Yeah, we fucking are.

24:14.795 --> 24:17.003
What do you know about fear?

24:17.086 --> 24:20.961
- When was the last time
you were even afraid?
- It's 1959.

24:21.795 --> 24:23.961
I'm in Gila Flats, New Mexico.

24:24.545 --> 24:27.420
I left my watch inside
the intrinsic field chamber,

24:27.503 --> 24:29.378
and now I'm locked inside,

24:29.462 --> 24:31.503
fully aware that when
the countdown ends,

24:31.587 --> 24:34.086
my skin will burn
off of my body.

24:34.170 --> 24:35.587
So, 50 years?

24:35.670 --> 24:38.128
The last time you were
afraid was 50 years ago?

24:38.211 --> 24:41.086
No, Angela.
I'm being torn apart right now.

24:41.170 --> 24:45.086
And then you put yourself
back together, piece by piece,

24:45.670 --> 24:47.879
and then you were
never scared again.

24:48.629 --> 24:50.920
Because if you know everything
that's gonna happen,

24:51.003 --> 24:52.712
what is there to be afraid of?

24:52.795 --> 24:54.503
What is there to risk?

24:54.587 --> 24:56.337
I'm taking a risk.

24:56.420 --> 24:58.086
I've been taking
a risk every day

24:58.170 --> 25:00.712
since you walked up
to me in that bar.

25:00.795 --> 25:02.378
What the fuck are you doing?

25:08.503 --> 25:09.920
I'm sorry.

25:13.170 --> 25:15.378
Do you need me to say it?

25:20.295 --> 25:21.629

paradoxical, but...

Nice to see you again, Jon.

27:17.462 --> 27:20.170
It's nice to see
you, too, Adrian.

27:20.253 --> 27:22.503
How did you know it was me?

27:23.170 --> 27:25.045
Because only Dr. Manhattan

27:25.128 --> 27:27.253
would have the balls
to show up here

27:27.337 --> 27:29.712
wearing nothing
but his birthday suit.

27:32.462 --> 27:33.879
Should I put something on?

27:35.879 --> 27:39.253
- Welcome back
to Antarctica, Jon.

27:39.337 --> 27:41.420
I do appreciate this visit.

27:41.503 --> 27:45.754
- How long has it been?
- For you, 24 years,

27:45.837 --> 27:48.754
41 days, and 13 hours.

27:48.837 --> 27:52.712
- For me, it's happening...
- Right now, yes, yes,
I remember.

27:52.795 --> 27:54.920
So, Jon,
what am I saying to you,

27:55.003 --> 27:58.253
24 years, 41 days,
and 13 hours ago?

27:58.337 --> 28:00.879
You've just attempted
to destroy me.

28:01.837 --> 28:04.545
I'm telling you that
I'm disappointed in you.

28:04.629 --> 28:06.253
Right.

28:07.754 --> 28:09.378
Sorry about that.

28:11.420 --> 28:14.337
Now, you're explaining
that you just killed
three million people.

28:15.754 --> 28:18.837
"Morally, you're in checkmate,"
you're telling me.

28:18.920 --> 28:21.086
I was gambling.

28:25.629 --> 28:26.795
Gambling?

28:26.879 --> 28:29.462
That you had morals.

28:37.253 --> 28:41.128
Still fabricating
alien incursions, I see.

28:42.128 --> 28:44.295
And maintaining world peace,

28:45.128 --> 28:47.670
one cephalopod at a time.

28:53.086 --> 28:55.920
It's quite an interesting
form you've...

28:56.003 --> 28:57.503
decided to take.

28:58.128 --> 28:59.879
Interesting?

29:00.337 --> 29:03.503
It's not the '80s anymore, Jon.

29:03.587 --> 29:07.420
This kind of appropriation
is considered quite...

29:08.170 --> 29:10.045
problematic now.

29:10.128 --> 29:12.795
It's 2009, Doctor.

29:12.879 --> 29:16.837
A lot has changed
while you were on Europa.

29:18.295 --> 29:20.086
How do you know I was on Europa?

29:20.170 --> 29:22.045
A little elephant told me.

29:23.670 --> 29:25.503
What I don't know...

29:25.587 --> 29:29.670
is why a blue man is
masquerading as a hu-man.

29:30.170 --> 29:33.712
Though, I might venture
an educated guess.

29:35.086 --> 29:36.837
What's her name?

29:40.837 --> 29:42.211
Angela.

29:43.503 --> 29:45.128
Love.

29:47.837 --> 29:49.420
Well...

29:49.503 --> 29:51.545
let me guess again.

29:52.961 --> 29:55.045
You're wearing this face

29:55.128 --> 29:57.462
because she has no idea

29:57.545 --> 29:59.795
you're the most omnipotent being

29:59.879 --> 30:02.003
in the history of civilization,

30:02.086 --> 30:07.503
whereas you just want her
to love you for you.

30:08.337 --> 30:10.629
I told her who I was
the moment I met her.

30:10.712 --> 30:13.295
She knows who you are?

30:13.378 --> 30:14.712
Yes.

30:15.378 --> 30:17.045
Ah!

30:17.128 --> 30:18.629
That's the rub.

30:18.712 --> 30:21.961
Because who in their right mind

30:22.045 --> 30:26.545
would want to be
romantically linked to a god?

30:27.086 --> 30:30.712
So, you don't just want
to look like a mortal,

30:31.545 --> 30:33.211
you wanna be one.

30:36.003 --> 30:37.211
Will you help me?

30:39.378 --> 30:40.879
Why can't you do it yourself?

30:41.961 --> 30:43.587
You tell me, Adrian.

30:44.211 --> 30:45.545
Because...

30:45.629 --> 30:49.503
you have a profound
lack of imagination.

30:49.587 --> 30:51.337
I gotta give it to you, man,

30:51.420 --> 30:53.961
you have a fantastic
imagination.

30:55.837 --> 30:58.503
- You laugh now!
- Wow!

30:58.587 --> 31:00.670
This Angela must be
quite something.

31:00.754 --> 31:02.378
Six months ago, she's telling me

31:02.462 --> 31:05.462
I have a fantastic imagination.

31:06.462 --> 31:08.086
Tell me something.

31:09.545 --> 31:11.045
Do you have a brain?

31:11.754 --> 31:14.670
-I'm sorry?
-Well, you seem
to have replicated

31:14.754 --> 31:17.211
basic human physiognomy,
but, uh,

31:17.295 --> 31:19.587
what about the physiology?

31:19.670 --> 31:22.003
You do have a brain,

31:22.086 --> 31:24.920
- internal organs, blood?
- Yes.

31:25.003 --> 31:26.503
- Yeah.
- Why?

31:27.170 --> 31:28.670
Well...

31:29.295 --> 31:31.170
theoretically,

31:31.253 --> 31:34.211
we could insert a device
into your prefrontal cortex

31:34.295 --> 31:37.545
that would short circuit
your memory.

31:37.629 --> 31:39.879
Without the awareness

31:39.961 --> 31:41.961
of your abilities,

31:42.420 --> 31:44.545
you wouldn't know to use them!

31:44.629 --> 31:47.545
Ah! Except, perhaps, as a reflex

31:47.629 --> 31:50.295
in life-threatening situations.

31:50.795 --> 31:52.170
You could walk and talk

31:52.253 --> 31:55.961
and live among
the normals undetected.

31:57.337 --> 32:00.295
You just wouldn't know
you were Dr. Manhattan.

32:03.295 --> 32:06.879
And how long would it take
for you to make this... device?

32:06.961 --> 32:10.128
Oh, my dear, sweet Jon.

32:12.003 --> 32:14.712

32:15.837 --> 32:17.754

32:17.837 --> 32:20.629

32:20.712 --> 32:23.253
But the intrinsic
field subtractor

32:23.337 --> 32:26.045
that I lured you
into was, in fact,

32:26.128 --> 32:27.795
