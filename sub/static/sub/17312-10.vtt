00:12.311 --> 00:14.871
Tonight, the great,
the good and the rubbish

00:14.871 --> 00:16.351
in the Top Gear Awards.

00:16.351 --> 00:20.251
We go on a motoring holiday
with the Stig,

00:20.251 --> 00:23.251
and Dr Who travels
through space and time

00:23.251 --> 00:24.741
a bit more slowly than usual.

00:24.741 --> 00:25.969
Speed up!

00:30.991 --> 00:33.311
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:33.311 --> 00:35.251
Hello and welcome!

00:35.251 --> 00:37.412
Thank you so much, thank you.

00:38.591 --> 00:43.311
Wow! Now, we begin with James May

00:43.311 --> 00:47.133
who has found a car that seems
to make him rather cross.

00:49.051 --> 00:51.337
This is the culprit...

00:52.311 --> 00:54.199
..the Jaguar S-Type.

00:56.191 --> 00:59.194
This car really, really winds me up.

01:00.191 --> 01:04.059
It sums up everything
that's wrong with Jaguar.

01:05.510 --> 01:08.971
You see, what they did with
the S-Type was to make a car

01:08.971 --> 01:12.251
that they hoped would appeal to
Germans and Americans

01:12.251 --> 01:14.961
and, you may ask,
what's wrong with that?

01:14.961 --> 01:16.711
Well, quite a lot, actually.

01:16.711 --> 01:22.551
You see, Mr Jonathan Foreigner has
this ridiculously outdated view of
what Britain is.

01:22.551 --> 01:25.251
He thinks we all live in
Anne Hathaway's cottage

01:25.251 --> 01:29.261
and then go out to Ye Olde Tearooms
where we eat some Kendal Mint Cake.

01:29.261 --> 01:33.871
Then maybe we'll go out to a red
phone box and ring up some
Beefeaters in the Tower of London,

01:33.871 --> 01:36.141
to see if we can have
our bowler hats back.

01:36.141 --> 01:37.371
It's rubbish!

01:37.371 --> 01:41.691
And Jaguar absolutely pandered
to this view with the S-Type.

01:41.691 --> 01:43.781
Just look at that retro grille -

01:43.781 --> 01:46.771
it's gawpingly awful.

01:46.771 --> 01:50.127
Now, I've been banging on
about this for years.

01:55.591 --> 01:58.992
And maybe, at last,
they've listened.

02:01.551 --> 02:04.401
Because this is the replacement
for the S-Type...

02:04.401 --> 02:07.973
Grrr!..the Jaguar XF.

02:21.551 --> 02:24.821
As soon as you look at it you think,
Ah, that's more like it.

02:24.821 --> 02:28.811
Look at the new grille and
the subtly bulging bonnet

02:28.811 --> 02:30.415
and the gills on the side...!

02:33.421 --> 02:34.981
Then there's the back,

02:34.981 --> 02:38.724
which looks as though
it came from the XK.

02:40.221 --> 02:42.621
Sounds like an XK as well.
You ready?

02:42.621 --> 02:44.418
IT ROARS

02:47.021 --> 02:50.631
This is the first time since
I started this job

02:50.631 --> 02:52.521
that I've been in a Jaguar saloon

02:52.521 --> 02:54.728
and felt that I was
in the right decade.

02:57.831 --> 02:59.961
In Beverly Hills
your retired dentist,

02:59.961 --> 03:03.861
he's going to have a heart attack
because,!That's not
a proper Jaguar.!

03:03.861 --> 03:05.911
Well, so be it.

03:05.911 --> 03:08.163
And there are more treats
on the inside.

03:09.961 --> 03:12.111
Imagine you're a bank manager.

03:12.111 --> 03:14.921
Now, in the olden days you'd have
climbed into your Jaguar,

03:14.921 --> 03:18.711
checked your parting in the
polished woodwork of your fascia,

03:18.711 --> 03:20.281
and you'd have been on your way.

03:20.281 --> 03:22.351
Now though...

03:23.381 --> 03:28.281
..the first thing you notice is this
red starter button pulsating
like a heartbeat.

03:28.281 --> 03:30.661
You touch that once to turn
the ignition on,

03:30.661 --> 03:35.501
and you're immediately bathed in
this beautiful pale blue light,

03:35.501 --> 03:38.661
Iike something from a funky vodka
bar and then, look at that!

03:38.661 --> 03:40.021
Look at those opening.

03:40.021 --> 03:43.841
Put your foot on the brake, press
it again to start the engine...

03:43.841 --> 03:47.511
and this thing rises up
from the centre console.

03:47.511 --> 03:50.221
That is actually the gear change.

03:50.221 --> 03:52.221
I know none of that
is strictly necessary,

03:52.221 --> 03:57.281
but as you watch it you can feel
all those years of financial
drudgery just falling away,

03:57.281 --> 04:00.364
until your 12 years old and back in
the world of Thunderbirds.

04:06.221 --> 04:10.301
However, once you look past
all this futuristic garnish,

04:10.301 --> 04:12.451
it's not quite so Tomorrow's World.

04:13.561 --> 04:17.221
Under the skin, the basic structure
is from the old S-Type,

04:17.221 --> 04:20.031
and the suspension is from the XK.

04:21.781 --> 04:23.721
The engines are also pretty old hat.

04:23.721 --> 04:27.921
We've still got the V6 diesel,
the V6 petrol and the V8 petrol,

04:27.921 --> 04:29.651
with or without the supercharger,

04:29.651 --> 04:31.881
and they've been around
for donkey's years.

04:34.021 --> 04:36.751
As Clarkson pointed out when he
drove the XK,

04:36.751 --> 04:41.361
you get the sense that Jaguar is
pushing the limits not
of its technology,

04:41.361 --> 04:42.965
but of its overdraft.

04:45.501 --> 04:49.481
But, if you were to keep
any old bits, it'd be these

04:49.481 --> 04:52.721
because for a saloon,
this is superb.

04:52.721 --> 04:56.202
It goes like a four-door XK.

05:02.301 --> 05:06.391
It has the supercharger
on the 4.2-litre V8,

05:06.391 --> 05:09.986
and it'll do nought to 60
in 5.1 seconds.

05:13.311 --> 05:17.501
But interestingly this isn't
the most powerful version
they're going to make.

05:17.501 --> 05:23.645
There will be a Jaguar XFR,
with even more POWER.

05:24.921 --> 05:26.695
And guess who'll be driving
that one.

16:28.121 --> 16:32.031
The BMW M3 is the world's
best-selling performance car.

16:32.031 --> 16:34.781
And is driven exclusively by BLEEP.

16:34.781 --> 16:36.841
That doesn't matter.
It does, honestly,

16:36.841 --> 16:40.391
because every single one of them
talks about marketing and solutions

16:40.391 --> 16:45.131
and they've all got those ridiculous
mobile-phone earpieces in.
He's right.

16:45.131 --> 16:47.391
The point is there's a new one out.

16:47.391 --> 16:49.801
To see if it's any good,
I took it to Spain

16:49.801 --> 16:52.315
to the Stig's favourite
holiday resort.

17:01.731 --> 17:04.861
Behind tough security,
to keep out the riff raff,

17:04.861 --> 17:07.511
there are pleasant gardens
where he can relax,

17:07.511 --> 17:10.011
a pool where he can unwind,

17:10.011 --> 17:12.951
and in the evening
a top-notch restaurant,

17:12.951 --> 17:14.737
where he can gorge on meat.

17:16.391 --> 17:19.451
It's a lovely spot
with excellent views,

17:19.451 --> 17:22.031
and - oh, yes, nearly forgot -

17:22.031 --> 17:25.922
in the grounds there's a
51/2-kilometre race track.

17:28.871 --> 17:32.181
It was built as a plaything
by a Dutch oil billionaire

17:32.181 --> 17:35.251
and features copies of some
of the best corners

17:35.251 --> 17:37.435
from other race tracks
around the world.

17:41.871 --> 17:44.071
It is a fantastic place.

17:44.071 --> 17:47.199
But the car I'm driving
is even better.

17:48.891 --> 17:50.597
TYRES SCREECH

17:53.451 --> 17:56.451
The last M3 had a
straight-six engine.

17:56.451 --> 17:59.431
This has a four-litre V8.

17:59.431 --> 18:03.913
But don't think for a minute
it's become a big, lazy muscle car.

18:05.231 --> 18:09.520
Yes, it's a big V8,
but it revs at 8,300rpm.

18:10.811 --> 18:12.597
It's such a screamer.

18:15.161 --> 18:18.591
That said, it is softer
than the old car.

18:18.591 --> 18:20.091
And more forgiving,

18:20.091 --> 18:21.649
but it's also noticeably faster.

19:03.969 --> 19:05.449
Get out of the way.

19:05.449 --> 19:07.326
TYRES SCREECH

19:08.619 --> 19:10.689
That'll be Jeremy then.
Here I come.

19:16.469 --> 19:19.949
This is Mercedes' answer to the M3.

19:19.949 --> 19:23.909
It's the AMG C-Class
and it's not a car,

19:23.909 --> 19:25.589
it's a complete animal.

19:25.589 --> 19:27.949
TYRES SCREECH

19:27.949 --> 19:29.179
Oh! Cripes!

19:29.179 --> 19:30.509
TYRES SCREECH

19:30.509 --> 19:34.434
You don't really drive this car,
you cling on for dear life!

19:37.009 --> 19:40.709
Sure, the new M3 has a
top-notch conventional weapon
under the bonnet,

19:40.709 --> 19:42.329
but this,

19:42.329 --> 19:44.479
this has a nuke.

19:45.849 --> 19:48.489
It's a 6.2 litre V8.

19:48.489 --> 19:53.569
It's not the full-fat 6.2
they put in their bigger cars.

19:53.569 --> 19:56.289
But even this semi-skimmed version

19:56.289 --> 20:00.629
has 450 brake horse power.

20:00.629 --> 20:03.989
So the 'umph' is as phenomenal
as the noise it makes.

20:03.989 --> 20:06.849
ENGINE ROARS

20:06.849 --> 20:09.089
Listen to that!

20:09.089 --> 20:12.569
It's not only louder, more powerful

20:12.569 --> 20:14.729
and more exciting than the M3,

20:14.729 --> 20:16.449
but it's simpler as well.

20:16.449 --> 20:19.532
It even has an automatic gear box.

20:21.929 --> 20:25.029
I will admit, however,
that there are one or two things

20:25.029 --> 20:26.729
I'm not sure about.

20:26.729 --> 20:28.929
It's not a very pretty car.

20:28.929 --> 20:32.459
I don't like the way Merc
has copied BMW's iDrive system,

20:32.459 --> 20:35.496
their old control centre was better,
it was easier to use.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.849
And then, rising above all this,

20:38.849 --> 20:40.299
is the problem -

20:40.299 --> 20:42.369
the traction control.

20:42.369 --> 20:44.149
ENGINE ROARS

20:44.149 --> 20:47.739
When it's on,
it's constantly interfering,

20:47.739 --> 20:49.829
every time you go near the throttle.

20:49.829 --> 20:53.299
Eventually, of course, you become
impatient and turn it off.

20:53.299 --> 20:56.269
But be advised, if you do that,

20:56.269 --> 20:57.829
you'd better be awake.

20:57.829 --> 21:00.779
TYRES SCREECH

21:00.779 --> 21:03.129
Oops-a-daisy.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.769
I've got it. There...
Oh, there. No.

21:05.769 --> 21:09.751
This is just an axe murderer
with headlights.

21:10.729 --> 21:13.471
And I absolutely adore it.

21:19.349 --> 21:21.359
This is mental.

21:21.359 --> 21:24.489
Jeremy, there's more to life
than a big shouty engine.

21:24.489 --> 21:28.239
No, there isn't. I'm
sorry, but the whole point of an M3

21:28.239 --> 21:30.439
is you can't tell
it isn't an ordinary BMW.

21:30.439 --> 21:32.769
Look, it's got M3 written here,
grooves...

21:32.769 --> 21:36.459
It's got more trinkets on it
than a pensioner's mantelpiece.

21:36.459 --> 21:40.369
I'm sorry, you cannot pitch up in
your sparkly disco glitter ball...

21:40.369 --> 21:45.299
Nobody ever said a Mercedes
had to be restrained.
you like the chrome. Honestly.

21:45.299 --> 21:47.529
I don't like the chrome very much.

21:47.529 --> 21:49.079
Well, that's all there is.

21:49.079 --> 21:52.179
Sunshine roof - oh, you haven't
got one. What the hell? What?

21:52.179 --> 21:54.229
What's this? Carbon fibre.

21:54.229 --> 21:55.529
Carbon fibre roof?

21:55.529 --> 21:57.539
It's to keep the centre
of gravity low,

21:57.539 --> 22:00.329
it keeps the weight down in the car,
it's light, that helps the balance.

22:00.329 --> 22:04.859
That's why this is such a good car.
It makes you look like a BLEEP.
Like your chrome is gonna help.

22:04.859 --> 22:06.139
Both of those cars are ostentatious.

23:34.639 --> 23:38.239
Has the captain arrived?
I believe so. In an Audi.

23:38.239 --> 23:41.739
This Audi is a very, very good car.
Couldn't agree with you more.

23:41.739 --> 23:44.689
I remember when I drove this
a couple of years ago,

23:44.689 --> 23:47.919
I believed that was one of
the greatest engines ever made.

23:47.919 --> 23:51.149
But you cannot ignore
the engine in that Mercedes.

23:51.149 --> 23:55.439
You just can't. Nobody saw
a 6.2 litre...

23:55.439 --> 23:57.719
..With 6.3 written on the side!

23:57.719 --> 24:00.399
That's just... Is it a 6.2?
Yes. It says 6.3 on it.

24:00.399 --> 24:03.299
Because that's history
and tradition. It's lying.

24:03.299 --> 24:04.899
It's just a random number. It isn't.

24:04.899 --> 24:09.159
'Instead of bickering,
we decided to get scientific
and discuss practicality. '

24:09.159 --> 24:11.599
First things first,
I'll just get in the back.

24:11.599 --> 24:13.159
Ya! Yes, all right!

24:13.159 --> 24:15.239
There is a four-door version coming.

24:15.239 --> 24:18.219
And the rear legroom is?
Plentiful.

24:18.219 --> 24:19.579
Pitiful. The Audi.

24:19.579 --> 24:21.899
And - oh, deary me!

24:21.899 --> 24:25.039
If we pop this seat
into MY driving position...

24:25.039 --> 24:27.119
That's hardly a fair test.

24:27.119 --> 24:30.299
Do you want to hop in? I'd love to!
Oh, I can't. I've got legs!

24:30.299 --> 24:34.299
'We could have argued all day,
but when it comes to practicality,

24:34.299 --> 24:35.505
'facts are the facts. '

24:36.299 --> 24:39.219
The Mercedes has the biggest engine,
the most gears,

24:39.219 --> 24:42.099
the most space in the front,
the most space in the back,

24:42.099 --> 24:43.439
and the biggest boot.

24:43.439 --> 24:44.440
The end.

24:45.559 --> 24:48.309
After this momentous victory
for the Mercedes,

24:48.309 --> 24:50.999
I decided we should
have a drag race.

24:50.999 --> 24:55.389
I'm actually, for the first time
in one of our drag races,
genuinely tense about this.

24:55.389 --> 24:57.139
I want this car to win.

24:57.139 --> 24:59.539
Don't lose! Don't lose, mad car.

24:59.539 --> 25:03.459
If I take the handbrake off,
that'll increase my chances.

25:03.459 --> 25:06.219
I'm not going to win this.
I'm going to humiliate them.

25:06.219 --> 25:08.403
ENGINES REV

25:10.349 --> 25:13.579
'Despite its four-wheel drive
system, the Audi took the lead. '

25:13.579 --> 25:15.219
I'm winning, I'm winning.

25:15.219 --> 25:16.349
'And then lost it. '

25:16.349 --> 25:17.629
Come on, come on!

25:17.629 --> 25:19.919
Come on, baby, come on.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.179
How did that happen?

25:21.179 --> 25:22.909
Rock 'n' roll!

25:22.909 --> 25:25.699
No, no, no!

25:25.699 --> 25:26.979
Loser!

25:26.979 --> 25:28.419
Oh!

25:28.419 --> 25:30.549
That's a pointless
and irrelevant test.

25:30.549 --> 25:32.979
James and Richard were annoyed.

25:32.979 --> 25:35.939
They'd lost out to the Merc's
superior practicality

25:35.939 --> 25:38.309
and its straight-line performance.

25:38.309 --> 25:42.859
Desperate for a victory,
James got out his tape measure

25:42.859 --> 25:46.069
to try and find any area
where the Audi was best.

25:46.069 --> 25:48.859
I'm measuring the steering wheel
to see whose is fattest.

25:48.859 --> 25:54.419
Meanwhile, Richard hauled me into
the circuit's conference suite,
for a PowerPoint presentation.

25:54.419 --> 25:58.909
Right, what I've got here is
a graph showing the torque curves
for each of the three...

25:58.909 --> 26:02.539
You're only doing this on
a PowerPoint so M3 drivers
know what you're on about.

26:02.539 --> 26:04.229
It's the easiest way to show it. No.

26:04.229 --> 26:07.229
What do you want for supper,
darling? I'll get the laptop.

26:07.229 --> 26:11.609
As you can see on this graph,
40% of me wants shepherd's pie
with peas... Shut up!

26:11.609 --> 26:14.989
.. 60% wants lamb chops. That's
an increase... Pay attention.

26:14.989 --> 26:17.779
This is useful information.
These are the torque curves.

26:17.779 --> 26:20.532
That's your Mercedes,
that's the Audi, that's the BMW.

26:21.707 --> 26:24.897
Jezza's wing mirrors
are an inch bigger than mine.

26:24.897 --> 26:28.587
So, the blue line is the Mercedes
and that's on the top.

26:28.587 --> 26:32.987
You've immediately assumed,
being you, that higher up the graph
is better. Is it?

26:32.987 --> 26:34.027
Yes, it is.

26:34.027 --> 26:35.667
Hammond's are two foot as well.

26:35.667 --> 26:38.137
I've got the smallest
windscreen wipers.

26:38.137 --> 26:41.067
Have you got power?
Yes. Look at the blue line!

26:41.067 --> 26:45.297
It's not as simple as that.
You've got to look at the...
Yeah, you're...

26:45.297 --> 26:46.587
You've lost. I have.

26:46.587 --> 26:48.373
Yes!

26:49.427 --> 26:53.773
My gear stick's got the biggest
knob diameter by half an inch.

26:59.097 --> 27:01.667
APPLAUSE

27:01.667 --> 27:04.307
You are such a child!

27:04.307 --> 27:05.987
I am a child, I admit.

27:05.987 --> 27:12.227
We'll pick that up later on because
now it's time to put a star
in our reasonably-priced car.

27:12.227 --> 27:14.507
My guest tonight needs
no introduction

27:14.507 --> 27:17.635
because he's Dr Who!
Ladies and gentlemen, David Tennant!

27:23.547 --> 27:27.574
How are you? Very good, very good.
Have a seat. Thank you.

27:29.527 --> 27:33.133
You are like a good-looking version
of Richard Hammond.

27:34.877 --> 27:36.547
The smoking jacket thing...

27:36.547 --> 27:38.687
This is new.
I've never worn this before.

27:38.687 --> 27:41.588
This is new too.
Will you be wearing it again? No.

27:42.487 --> 27:45.727
It's so nice to have a good-looking
chap in that chair for once.

27:45.727 --> 27:50.367
And popular too.
Two years you've won the most
popular television actor

27:50.367 --> 27:53.367
at the National Television Awards,
am I right?

27:53.367 --> 27:55.637
I think that might be accurate, yes.

27:55.637 --> 27:59.687
I didn't spoil it for you
by telling you you'd won
while the nominations...

27:59.687 --> 28:01.287
Is that what that meant? Yeah.

28:01.287 --> 28:03.937
I may have actually got all the
winners and losers before

28:03.937 --> 28:06.849
and I had a great evening telling
the losers...

28:08.367 --> 28:11.847
Now, as a kid, is it true
you wanted to be Dr Who?

28:11.847 --> 28:15.247
Didn't everyone
who grew up in the '70s?

28:15.247 --> 28:17.897
I thought they did. Yeah...

28:17.897 --> 28:19.831
I wanted to be Julie Christie's
underwear.

28:21.367 --> 28:24.497
I don't know where to go with that.

28:24.497 --> 28:25.637
Wherever you like.

28:25.637 --> 28:28.327
You wanted to be the Doctor.

28:28.327 --> 28:31.297
I did, yeah. I thought that would be
quite a laugh.

28:31.297 --> 28:36.527
Then I grew up and thought, that's
never going to happen, that's absurd,
but I'd quite like to be an actor.

28:36.527 --> 28:40.587
Then, funnily enough,
it came back round again.
Who'd have thought it? I know.

28:40.587 --> 28:43.447
You took your name from
Neil Tennant, is that right?

28:43.447 --> 28:47.117
It sort of is. I was 16 when
I joined Equity, the actors' union.

28:47.117 --> 28:51.157
There's a rule that there's not
allowed to be two actors
with the same name.

28:51.157 --> 28:53.997
So, David McDonald, my real name,
was disallowed.

28:53.997 --> 28:57.707
So, at 16, I thought,
where do you find a new name from?

28:57.707 --> 28:59.481
So I looked in Smash Hits.

29:00.857 --> 29:03.427
That's what you read when you're 16,
isn't it?

29:03.427 --> 29:07.037
It's a good job it wasn't Madonna.
Yes. You'd look ridiculous then.

29:07.037 --> 29:11.427
So that was it...
I read somewhere, how many times
have you auditioned for Taggart?

29:11.427 --> 29:12.917
Oh, about 26.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.037
No way.

29:14.037 --> 29:17.847
I went up for Taggart every week
in Scotland and they
never gave me a part.

29:17.847 --> 29:23.497
You must be the only Scottish person
never in Taggart. Some people have
played four different murderers!

29:23.497 --> 29:26.557
So we've got the Christmas special,
obviously.

29:26.557 --> 29:30.197
What's the storyline?
It's a big disaster movie, really.

29:30.197 --> 29:33.037
The Titanic has crashed through
the walls of the TARDIS.

29:33.037 --> 29:35.717
At the end of the last series,
you might have caught that.

29:35.717 --> 29:39.247
Mayhem ensues from there on in.

29:39.247 --> 29:42.217
Kylie Minogue is serving
as a waitress on the Titanic.

29:42.217 --> 29:44.597
She gets swept up... By you?

29:44.597 --> 29:46.627
Yeah, a little bit. Um...

29:46.627 --> 29:49.657
Cos I know you've got two hearts.
Yeah.

29:49.657 --> 29:53.327
So, have you got two...?
LAUGHTER

29:53.327 --> 29:55.997
You'll have to ask Kylie.

29:55.997 --> 30:00.527
Well, Billy Piper calls you
David ten-inch, doesn't she?

30:00.527 --> 30:02.997
That could be two fives...

30:02.997 --> 30:04.397
God bless her for it.

30:04.397 --> 30:05.398
Yeah. Yeah.

30:06.937 --> 30:09.797
Have you ever asked about
the details of the TARDIS?

30:09.797 --> 30:14.807
Do you know how it works?
Of course I do. How does it work?
You wouldn't understand. Try me.

30:14.807 --> 30:16.997
It's very complicated.

30:16.997 --> 30:19.217
Is it? Is there some maths?

30:19.217 --> 30:21.697
It's got a lot to do
with a gravitic anomaliser.

30:21.697 --> 30:24.997
I thought it would do. Yeah.

30:24.997 --> 30:26.437
What's its top speed?

30:26.437 --> 30:29.747
Er, well, it's relative.

30:31.257 --> 30:32.717
As is time.

30:32.717 --> 30:33.797
Ahh!

30:33.797 --> 30:35.807
All right. Cars.

30:35.807 --> 30:37.343
Yeah.

30:39.077 --> 30:42.807
Occasionally we have people on
with pretty poor car histories.

30:42.807 --> 30:46.497
Yeah, sure. James Blunt springs to
mind. It was one and it was a Lada.

30:46.497 --> 30:48.737
Right. You talk us through it.

30:48.737 --> 30:51.537
My first car - Ford Fiesta.

30:51.537 --> 30:52.797
Second car?

30:52.797 --> 30:54.137
Ford Escort.

30:54.137 --> 30:56.057
We're moving up. Yeah.

30:56.057 --> 30:57.307
And then?

30:57.307 --> 30:59.697
And then, I had a Skoda.

30:59.697 --> 31:01.797
LAUGHTER

31:01.797 --> 31:05.937
You see, it's still a punch line.
It is. If it's a good car...?

31:05.937 --> 31:11.807
Is it a modern or an old Skoda?
Modern Skoda. A non-comedy...
I still have the Skoda.

31:11.807 --> 31:15.377
You do! Yeah. Dr Who has a Skoda.

31:15.377 --> 31:19.427
Yes. What sort is it?
Skoda Octavia Ambiente.

31:19.427 --> 31:22.897
It was the best car I had
until recently when it went in
for a service

31:22.897 --> 31:27.717
and came back with a list of things
which suddenly made it
not financially viable any more.

31:27.717 --> 31:31.067
You haven't got the Skoda? I do,
but I'm trading it in next week.

31:31.067 --> 31:37.077
By the time this broadcasts
I'll have done the exchange
so they'll have got it by then.

31:37.077 --> 31:40.672
Someone will be going,!I've got
Dr Who's BLEEP. It doesn't work!!

31:41.697 --> 31:44.657
!What are all these
flashing lights?!

31:44.657 --> 31:48.447
I understand that you've been -
how can I put this? -

31:48.447 --> 31:52.507
whinging about when Billie Piper
came here, about her lap.

31:52.507 --> 31:55.507
And how you think
she may have cut the corner a bit.

31:55.507 --> 31:57.717
To be fair, Jeremy... Yeah?

31:57.717 --> 32:02.767
I've seen it. She clearly drove
a track that she made up.

32:02.767 --> 32:04.657
You're right. She did make it up.

32:04.657 --> 32:10.257
And then you said, we're going to
have to deduct, or add a few extra
seconds for you.

32:10.257 --> 32:11.437
We did say that.

32:11.437 --> 32:15.067
Then she just kind of battered
her eyelids at you...

32:15.067 --> 32:17.227
and her time stands.

32:17.227 --> 32:19.377
Actually, the main reason was...

32:19.377 --> 32:22.007
she had a completely
see-through top on.

32:22.007 --> 32:25.817
I can't deduct points for that.

32:25.817 --> 32:29.567
Could you?
Listen, Billie's very charming...

32:29.567 --> 32:30.687
Mmm.

32:30.687 --> 32:34.307
I've been on the receiving end
of her eyelid-fluttering... Yes.

32:34.307 --> 32:37.107
It butters many parsnips. But...

32:37.107 --> 32:39.517
LAUGHTER

32:39.517 --> 32:42.967
I just know she'll beat me now and
I'll never hear the end of it!

32:42.967 --> 32:46.427
We don't know. We don't know
if you've cut corners or anything.

32:46.427 --> 32:52.567
All I do know, is that you did have
a bit of a problem with third gear.

32:52.567 --> 32:53.877
Yeah.

32:53.877 --> 32:58.227
Who'd like to see David's problems
with third gear?

32:58.227 --> 32:59.967
Yes?
AUDIENCE: Yes!

32:59.967 --> 33:01.717
Let's play this.

33:01.717 --> 33:03.992
Third gear, come on, find it.
There it is.

33:06.787 --> 33:09.867
Where are you, third gear?
Thank you.

33:09.867 --> 33:12.427
Third gear, you loony.

33:12.427 --> 33:14.647
Fourth. Come on.

33:14.647 --> 33:16.807
Third gear, where are you?

33:16.807 --> 33:18.407
Oh, there you are.

33:18.407 --> 33:20.087
It wouldn't go in!

33:20.087 --> 33:24.607
Do you know where third gear was
after he finished
that particular session?

33:24.607 --> 33:26.127
All over the track.

33:26.127 --> 33:28.087
I broke the car, didn't I?

33:28.087 --> 33:29.457
You broke third gear.

33:29.457 --> 33:33.387
Yeah. So we got you the spare car
and who'd like to see
what he did to that?

33:33.387 --> 33:34.867
AUDIENCE: Yeah!
Here we go!

33:34.867 --> 33:36.317
TYRES SCREECH

33:36.317 --> 33:39.867
A good fast start with a lot of
wheel spin and some Scottish mist.

33:39.867 --> 33:42.067
Yeah. Coming down
to the first corner.

33:42.067 --> 33:46.087
What am I looking at the wing mirror
for? There's no-one behind me!

33:46.087 --> 33:48.927
It's good highway-code sense. It is.

33:48.927 --> 33:52.767
And across the zebra very fast.
That's probably a bit too fast.

33:52.767 --> 33:55.967
That was bad! That was BAD!

33:55.967 --> 34:00.847
Yeah. It is the understeer.
You've got to kill that understeer
by being slower to go faster.

34:00.847 --> 34:05.977
It sounds ridiculous but it's true.
I know, and I could hear the Stig
in my head every time I messed up.

34:05.977 --> 34:09.167
This is better. Yeah! Look at that!

34:09.167 --> 34:12.737
That's a very good hammerhead.
It's pretty good.

34:12.737 --> 34:14.136
Speed up!

34:15.127 --> 34:19.456
It does look slower on the telly
than it is when you're in the car.

34:19.456 --> 34:22.887
Get right out to the edge.
Third gear, come on!

34:22.887 --> 34:25.257
No! Fourth through there!

34:25.257 --> 34:29.527
Fourth through the tyres.
That's a good line.
It's good I made the camera wobble.

34:29.527 --> 34:32.587
Braking. Third gear. Braking.

34:34.257 --> 34:37.206
That's a bit slow.
Quite pedestrian actually.

34:37.206 --> 34:38.567
Very slow.

34:38.567 --> 34:41.866
Here we go, round Gambon.
There we go, and across the line!

34:46.097 --> 34:47.536
It's...

34:47.536 --> 34:48.764
Oh.

34:49.777 --> 34:51.887
It's so frustrating though.

34:51.887 --> 34:54.937
It's so frustrating because
I didn't have a clean round.

34:54.937 --> 34:57.927
I didn't have one round
when I didn't do something stupid.

34:57.927 --> 34:59.647
But you didn't cross any lines.

34:59.647 --> 35:02.897
So I don't have to flutter
my eyelids at you. No, you don't.

35:02.897 --> 35:05.407
So, where do you think you came?
It's not great.

35:05.407 --> 35:06.937
Jools Hollandish?

35:06.937 --> 35:08.817
1.49.9. No, it's better than that.

35:08.817 --> 35:11.887
Good. You're in the 1.40s.
Have I beaten Billie, the Piper?

35:11.887 --> 35:13.367
What did she do?

35:13.367 --> 35:15.337
Apparently, she did 1.48.3.

35:15.337 --> 35:18.727
She did a 1.48.3.
You did a 1.48...

35:18.727 --> 35:20.127
Come on.

35:20.127 --> 35:22.177
...8.

35:22.177 --> 35:24.057
AUDIENCE: Ohh.

35:24.057 --> 35:28.039
Billie Piper the assistant
is faster than the master.

35:35.277 --> 35:37.897
But strictly speaking... Yeah?

35:37.897 --> 35:41.347
..where Billie's, you know,
taking her penalties...

35:41.347 --> 35:46.177
You'd have been faster.
If you'd have thought to wear
a black see-through top,

35:46.177 --> 35:48.497
you would now have beaten
Simon Cowell.

35:48.497 --> 35:49.777
If I undo a button...

35:49.777 --> 35:54.377
No. James might rush in
and put you further up, but no...

35:54.377 --> 35:57.577
Anyway, there you are and it's been
a pleasure having you here.

35:57.577 --> 35:59.737
Lovely to be here.
Thank you for coming.

35:59.737 --> 36:01.625
Ladies and gentlemen, David Tennant.

36:07.385 --> 36:08.505
And now...

36:08.505 --> 36:13.355
Hush. And now it is time for the
glittering Top Gear awards ceremony

36:13.355 --> 36:16.635
held here in front of
whoever's bothered to turn up.

36:16.635 --> 36:20.845
Yes, it's where we celebrate
all that's good and bad
in the world of cars

36:20.845 --> 36:24.542
here in the glittering West End
of Guildford.

36:26.055 --> 36:30.255
It is now time for the lifetime
achievement award.

36:30.255 --> 36:33.935
Now, this is awarded to the person
who's done the most

36:33.935 --> 36:39.215
to ruin the lives of Britain's
33 million motorists.

36:39.215 --> 36:42.125
And the nominees are:

36:42.125 --> 36:48.715
Ken Livingstone, for not realising
that the introduction of bendy buses
to London's streets

36:48.715 --> 36:53.880
is about as sensible as introducing
a fleet of oil tankers
to the Shropshire Union Canal.

36:55.135 --> 36:57.025
Ken Livingstone,

36:57.025 --> 37:00.975
for deciding that
if you earn a living and pay tax,

37:00.975 --> 37:03.335
and spend some of what's left
on a car,

37:03.335 --> 37:06.495
and then pay value added tax
on that,

37:06.495 --> 37:10.885
and then buy some road fund licence
tax to put the car on the road

37:10.885 --> 37:17.215
and then pay fuel duty tax
on the fuel and value added tax
on that fuel duty tax,

37:17.215 --> 37:20.575
you should then pay £25 tax

37:20.575 --> 37:23.895
to drive into the centre
of the capital.

37:23.895 --> 37:26.975
Right, and the final nomination
is Ken Livingstone,

37:26.975 --> 37:32.785
for putting my flat 50 yards inside
the new enlarged congestion zone.

37:32.785 --> 37:37.475
Jeremy, it's about 33 million
motorists, not just you.

37:37.475 --> 37:40.095
Right, the winner. Where is it?
Here we go.

37:40.095 --> 37:42.735
It's not Ken Livingstone!

37:42.735 --> 37:47.975
It's the traffic Wombles
who close motorways for six hours

37:47.975 --> 37:52.695
every single time somebody's
door mirror comes off
so they can retrieve it safely.

37:52.695 --> 37:53.985
So, well done, them.

37:53.985 --> 37:56.556
APPLAUSE

37:58.675 --> 38:03.015
OK. This is the award
for the ugliest car of the year.

38:03.015 --> 38:06.375
And the nominations... There's
no point. It's the Mini Clubman.

38:06.375 --> 38:07.945
It is. By miles.

38:07.945 --> 38:09.815
That's the ugliest.

38:09.815 --> 38:14.885
So, let's get on.
Here's the big one.
The worst car of the year award.

38:14.885 --> 38:18.295
The nominations... Actually,
it's the Mini Clubman, isn't it?

38:18.295 --> 38:20.615
No, it's not.
It isn't the Mini Clubman!

38:20.615 --> 38:22.705
No, it isn't the Mini Clubman.

38:22.705 --> 38:27.235
No. The winner this year
and indeed for every year
whilst we have breath in our bodies,

38:27.235 --> 38:32.675
is the most stupid,
useless and dangerous car
ever to stalk the Earth.

38:32.675 --> 38:36.293
It is the totally terrible
and disgusting G-Wiz.

38:46.235 --> 38:48.175
It's not a car that, is it? No.

38:48.175 --> 38:52.775
Neither is it, as they claim
to get round safety regulations,
a quadricycle.

38:52.775 --> 38:55.895
But we did think,
with a few modifications,

38:55.895 --> 38:59.795
it might just make a very good
radio-controlled car.

38:59.795 --> 39:02.055
I went to find out.

39:02.055 --> 39:05.325
For this experiment,
we've come here to Swindon.

39:05.325 --> 39:08.895
It's the Wiltshire branch
of the Science Museum.

39:08.895 --> 39:12.865
So, it's got the sort of academic
atmosphere we need.

39:15.715 --> 39:18.145
It's also got a socking great runway

39:18.145 --> 39:21.495
which is excellent,
because a good radio-control car

39:21.495 --> 39:22.895
needs to be fast.

39:22.895 --> 39:27.745
So, that means we'll have to make
our normal G-Wiz a lot faster.

39:27.745 --> 39:33.065
Let me demonstrate the problem
with speed by carrying out
a simple drag race.

39:33.065 --> 39:35.895
I shall pilot the G-Wiz.

39:35.895 --> 39:37.535
48 volts.

39:37.535 --> 39:40.405
0-40 in quite a while.

39:40.405 --> 39:43.455
And I'll put it up against
an everyday normal car.

39:43.455 --> 39:46.925
A genuine 500-horsepower Mustang.

39:48.305 --> 39:49.445
Should be close.

39:49.445 --> 39:50.655
CARS REV

39:50.655 --> 39:53.294
..Two, one, go!

39:57.955 --> 39:59.752
We're off, we're off, we're off!

40:01.405 --> 40:02.429
It's pulling away.

40:04.545 --> 40:06.945
It's pulled away some more.

40:34.185 --> 40:35.971
So, not good.

40:37.905 --> 40:41.285
But, our radio-controlled version
should pep things up.

40:41.285 --> 40:46.405
We've made it using the scientific
principle of more is more.

40:46.405 --> 40:49.725
Basically it's got ten times more
battery power.

40:49.725 --> 40:56.205
And to help put that power down
we fitted it with fat tyres
from a Formula 3 racing car.

40:56.205 --> 40:57.968
So, let's run the drag race again.

40:59.725 --> 41:02.444
Three, two, one, go!

41:07.985 --> 41:09.065
Yeah. Try that!

41:10.965 --> 41:13.885
That's more like it.
Come on! Come on!

41:13.885 --> 41:15.535
Yes.

41:15.535 --> 41:17.241
Come on!

41:19.645 --> 41:20.685
Yes!

41:20.685 --> 41:24.565
But a good radio-control car
should also handle well.

41:24.565 --> 41:27.085
So, along with the fat tyres,

41:27.085 --> 41:30.646
our G-Wiz has been lowered
and widened.

41:31.845 --> 41:35.725
To test its handling
we've made ourselves a circuit

41:35.725 --> 41:38.495
and to really find out
if our mods have worked,

41:38.495 --> 41:41.965
it'll be racing against
a conventional remote-control car.

41:41.965 --> 41:46.145
Now, for this race, I shall pilot
the little remote-control car

41:46.145 --> 41:49.225
because to get the best
out of the G-Wiz for this test,

41:49.225 --> 41:52.595
it needs to be controlled
by our finest driver.

41:52.595 --> 41:55.285
Someone who has never sat
on Santa's knee.

41:55.285 --> 41:58.698
Someone who has never watched
Moonraker on Boxing Day.

42:03.885 --> 42:05.625
Right, here we go.

42:09.725 --> 42:11.395
Oh, come on!

42:11.395 --> 42:14.455
Not to worry. I had a back-up.

42:16.645 --> 42:18.055
Yes!

42:22.865 --> 42:24.385
First corner coming up.

42:24.385 --> 42:27.741
Time to see what the Stig makes
of our handling changes.

42:29.525 --> 42:31.186
Oh, he won't like that.

42:41.235 --> 42:43.055
No, that's not good.

42:47.875 --> 42:49.945
Second corner.

42:52.025 --> 42:55.017
And I knew that if I caught the Stig
he'd squash me again.

42:56.115 --> 42:57.835
But no matter.

42:57.835 --> 43:00.201
Because the pick-up is carrying
a special low.

43:01.595 --> 43:03.535
When I press this little button...

43:03.535 --> 43:04.797
BUZZ

43:10.475 --> 43:11.897
Oh, yeah.

43:17.955 --> 43:19.475
It worked.

43:19.475 --> 43:20.735
That's one less.

43:20.735 --> 43:24.235
Oh, yes. It's a start.
That is what's called a start. Yeah.

43:24.235 --> 43:29.575
And now, the award for the
worst-dressed presenter on Top Gear.

43:29.575 --> 43:30.815
LAUGHTER

43:30.815 --> 43:32.535
Whoa!

43:32.535 --> 43:34.195
And the nominations are...

43:34.195 --> 43:37.596
Richard Hammond's shorts
in the London race.

43:38.595 --> 43:39.835
Yeah.

43:39.835 --> 43:45.015
And Richard Hammond's Spandau Ballet
tribute coat a couple of weeks ago.

43:45.015 --> 43:47.035
Yeah. Check that out.

43:47.035 --> 43:50.857
The winner, and I have
a good feeling about this one...

43:52.295 --> 43:53.595
Oh.

43:53.595 --> 43:58.535
It's Jeremy Clarkson
from a British Leyland cars film
for his dry suit.

43:58.535 --> 44:01.935
What? I thought
that was in the bag for me!

44:01.935 --> 44:02.965
Whoa, yeah.

44:02.965 --> 44:06.696
I'm sorry. What about James May
in the Aston Martin? Look!

44:08.035 --> 44:11.735
Ah, yes, but I'm not actually
dressed at all there.

44:11.735 --> 44:15.395
All right, I'll move on. This is for
the best noise we've heard all year.

44:15.395 --> 44:18.195
And the nominations are...
the Ascari A10.

44:18.195 --> 44:20.698
LOUD ENGINE NOISE

44:23.205 --> 44:24.565
Ooh, that's a good noise.

44:24.565 --> 44:27.315
The Aston Martin DBS for this.

44:27.315 --> 44:29.835
LOUD ROAR

44:29.835 --> 44:33.815
And the tunnel we went through
on the Italian Riviera.

44:33.815 --> 44:35.703
LOUD ECHOING ENGINE NOISE

44:47.315 --> 44:50.555
But the winner was in fact
none of those.

44:50.555 --> 44:53.565
The best noise we heard in motoring
all year

44:53.565 --> 44:56.955
was Richard Hammond
when Oliver sank.

44:58.565 --> 45:00.485
Float!

45:00.485 --> 45:01.895
Oliver!

45:02.955 --> 45:04.104
Yeah.

45:10.235 --> 45:16.255
You thought you'd seen the last
of him, but we've flown him
9,000 miles to be here tonight.

45:16.255 --> 45:19.053
Ladies and gentlemen,
Oliver is here!

45:21.125 --> 45:23.795
Oliver! Oliver!

45:23.795 --> 45:26.325
We're going to burn it!

45:26.325 --> 45:28.985
Yes, we are! No!

45:28.985 --> 45:33.045
Hey, hey, hey,
time for the best driver award.

45:33.045 --> 45:38.895
This is for the guest who's
come to our track and performed,
not the fastest, but the best.

45:38.895 --> 45:41.765
The nominations are...
Jennifer Saunders.

45:41.765 --> 45:46.155
Can't let the girls down. She was
nearly the fastest of all of them.

45:46.155 --> 45:50.165
We were hugely impressed
with her competitiveness and style.

45:50.165 --> 45:53.565
Then there was Lawrence Dallaglio
who was also fast,

45:53.565 --> 45:58.525
bearing in mind he'd turned up
with two 400lb shoulder muscles.

45:58.525 --> 46:04.566
The winner actually it turns out
is the fastest.
It's Simon Cowell, everybody.

46:10.685 --> 46:15.765
Sadly, Simon couldn't be here
to collect his award in person,

46:15.765 --> 46:20.065
so earlier today,
James dropped it off at his house.

46:20.065 --> 46:22.090
This is it.

46:31.205 --> 46:33.207
DOORBELL RINGS

46:39.685 --> 46:42.165
DOORBELL RINGS

46:48.985 --> 46:50.845
Well done, anyway.

46:50.845 --> 46:52.065
To Simon!

46:52.065 --> 46:54.125
Well done, Simon.

46:54.125 --> 46:56.695
If you haven't got your award,
the milkman has it.

46:56.695 --> 47:01.165
Right, that's that one done.
We can move on to the big one.

47:01.165 --> 47:05.965
The Top Gear
Car of the Year Award 2007.

47:05.965 --> 47:10.355
This is a tricky one
because we decided
that all three of us had to agree.

47:10.355 --> 47:13.885
It was very hard to find one
we all liked.

47:13.885 --> 47:18.215
The Aston Martin DBS I nominated,
because it's the most fun
I've had all year. Too expensive.

47:18.215 --> 47:20.925
James said it was too expensive
so that was that out.

47:20.925 --> 47:26.101
What about the Porsche 911 GT3 RS?
Broke down,
and it has scaffolding in back.

47:26.215 --> 47:30.685
If you won't agree. It has to be
the Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead.

47:30.685 --> 47:34.805
Puff Diddley would feel daft scooting
about in one of those. It is flashy.

47:34.805 --> 47:38.335
It is a bit ostentatious, James,
if we're honest. All right.

47:38.335 --> 47:43.945
Audi R8? It's brilliant.
It's a fabulous car,
but I just don't want one.

47:43.945 --> 47:47.975
The Audio R8 is like... It's like
going on holiday in Germany.

47:47.975 --> 47:52.355
Everything is very clean and
efficient, you just don't go there.

47:52.355 --> 47:55.404
It's lacking something. Yeah. Um...

48:00.035 --> 48:04.065
Has anybody got any ideas
what could be our Car of the Year?

48:04.065 --> 48:08.035
AUDIENCE SHOUT OUT
Who said Oliver?

48:08.035 --> 48:10.405
Oliver! Yeah.

48:10.405 --> 48:14.341
I would rather eat
my gentleman vegetables.

48:15.355 --> 48:20.675
We've had a Fiat 500. Fiat 500.
James... Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Anyone else?

48:20.675 --> 48:25.665
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Suzuki Swift!
For crying out loud! Suzuki Swift!

48:25.665 --> 48:30.595
It is actually a very good car. This
is important. It's like the Oscars.

48:30.595 --> 48:33.555
Ah, I've got an idea.

48:33.555 --> 48:37.355
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Ford Mondeo!
The same one! The Ford Mondeo.

48:37.355 --> 48:41.195
Actually, I can't think
of anything wrong with it.

48:41.195 --> 48:46.945
James, can you think of anything
wrong with the Ford Mondeo? It
drives well. I can't. It looks good.

48:46.945 --> 48:50.215
It's got a huge amount of space.
It drives as well as a Beamer.

48:50.215 --> 48:52.675
Loads of dealers.
I like the interior.

48:52.675 --> 48:56.795
Very well priced. Good engines.
There's loads of room.

48:56.795 --> 49:03.215
Hmm! As it happens. As it happens,
we never mentioned it when it came
out, we never road tested it,

49:03.215 --> 49:10.195
but there we are, the 2007 Top Gear
Car of the Year is... What about
the Subaru Legacy Outback?

49:10.195 --> 49:13.215
That's brilliant!
That is an excellent car.

49:13.215 --> 49:17.855
That's made it complicated.
No, it hasn't. Here we go.

49:17.855 --> 49:21.035
The most prestigious award
in motoring,

49:21.035 --> 49:25.795
the Top Gear Car of the Year 2007
is...

49:25.795 --> 49:28.115
either...

49:28.115 --> 49:32.835
the Subaru Legacy Outback
or the Ford Mondeo.

49:32.835 --> 49:35.998
Yeah! Well done! One of those two!

49:39.035 --> 49:43.165
Now, earlier on, the three of us were
at a private race track in Spain.

49:43.165 --> 49:45.495
Fabulous place -
pools, restaurants, the lot -

49:45.495 --> 49:50.305
but we were there
to find out which is the best
small, fast German saloon.

49:50.305 --> 49:54.515
I reckoned it was the BMW M3,
James reckoned it was the Audi RS4

49:54.515 --> 49:58.515
and Jeremy reckoned it was
the 6.2 litre Mercedes C-Class.

49:58.515 --> 50:02.395
Yes, and after part one of the film,
the Mercedes was winning.

50:02.395 --> 50:05.105
I had the largest diameter knob.

50:05.105 --> 50:11.585
You did, however, the Mercedes
was the fastest in a straight line,
the most practical,

50:11.585 --> 50:16.124
and the most powerful, and now we're
going to get back to the action.

50:22.435 --> 50:27.495
What we're going to do now
is find out how fast each car
will go round the track.

50:27.495 --> 50:30.495
For that,
we need our team racing driver.

50:30.495 --> 50:37.515
Some say that as we speak he is
actually relaxing in the resort pool
and he is, actually. He is.

50:40.264 --> 50:42.403
MUZAK PLAYS

50:49.414 --> 50:54.863
We dragged him out of the pool
and plonked him into
his holiday hire car.

51:02.414 --> 51:05.994
This is Emerson Fittipaldi's
F1 Lotus,

51:05.994 --> 51:10.260
which won the world championship
in 1972.

51:14.334 --> 51:19.274
Amazingly, it produces
420 brake horsepower,

51:19.274 --> 51:23.074
the same sort of power
you get from our saloons.

51:24.394 --> 51:29.434
So, first up, let's see how fast
this gets round the track.

51:42.334 --> 51:47.601
They brought that car out in 1970.
1971 season began.!What have you
done to change it?!!Nothing.!

51:49.554 --> 51:54.036
Didn't change it until '75.
Every year, they said,
!It was good last year. Look!!

51:58.954 --> 52:00.842
Aw!

52:04.124 --> 52:09.614
An interesting thing about that car
is it had torsion beam suspension
which was forgiving in slow corners,

52:09.614 --> 52:15.758
which made the tyres last longer.
You managed to find something boring
about something exciting. It isn't.

52:20.594 --> 52:24.134
Do we have a time? 2.15.16.

52:24.134 --> 52:28.754
Yes! 2.15.16 is... The time.
..the time it did.

52:28.754 --> 52:31.598
The Stig then switched to the Merc.

52:34.604 --> 52:35.844
I'm getting ready to run away.

52:39.284 --> 52:42.914
Look at it! Look at it move!
What a machine!

52:42.914 --> 52:47.284
Pile on the brakes. Look at that!
He's missed the apex.

52:47.284 --> 52:49.878
He was going straight on!

52:52.494 --> 52:54.564
When do you feel most alive?

52:54.564 --> 52:57.214
When you're right...
that close to death.

52:57.214 --> 53:01.644
Every time you get in that car,
the greatest thing in your life is
you can get out alive?

53:01.644 --> 53:06.354
You get to every destination and go,
!Yes! I'm alive!! You don't think
that might wear a bit?

53:07.404 --> 53:14.364
The Merc has more power
than the Lotus F1, but could it beat
its 2.15 lap time?

53:14.364 --> 53:18.414
2.43.
LAUGHTER
You thought...

53:18.414 --> 53:21.247
Next up, Captain Slow's Audi.

53:26.814 --> 53:31.404
I'm going to be 430 years old
by the time it gets here.
So it's gonna take six months?

53:31.404 --> 53:34.885
When it comes through, it'll look
quick. You'll be able to see it.

53:38.684 --> 53:40.554
Oh!

53:40.554 --> 53:47.004
So when you were saying that
it won't slide, what you meant was,
!I can't slide it.! Yes.

53:47.004 --> 53:48.844
SCREECHING

53:48.844 --> 53:54.362
I hate that sound of understeer.
That... Disappointing, isn't it?
It sounded disappointing.

53:55.824 --> 54:00.424
Could we have a time, please?
2 minutes 43.5 to beat.

54:00.424 --> 54:03.924
The RS4 did it in 2 minutes 43.9.

54:03.924 --> 54:07.064
Ooh!
JEREMY LAUGHS

54:07.064 --> 54:13.064
Hang on! That means your extra
45 horsepower has bought you
less than half a second.

54:13.064 --> 54:18.364
All that noise. All that noise.
It is the sound made by an idiot.

54:18.364 --> 54:22.107
So with the Audi out of the running,
it was the M3's turn.

54:27.924 --> 54:30.518
It is impossible for your car
to be faster than my car.

54:32.724 --> 54:38.731
I've got more brake horsepower
and more brake horsepower per ton.
It's out of control.

54:43.624 --> 54:45.824
Boring! Boring?

54:45.824 --> 54:46.904
Boring there.

54:46.904 --> 54:49.828
M3 drivers have no friends.

54:51.274 --> 54:57.725
It's just dreary. It's not dreary.
It's aggressive, it looks menacing,
purposeful, but not overstated.

54:59.564 --> 55:02.564
The M3 did a 2 minute 38. 9.

55:02.564 --> 55:04.284
RICHARD SIGHS

55:04.284 --> 55:06.294
JEREMY COUGHS

55:06.294 --> 55:09.284
That is quite funny.
RICHARD LAUGHS

55:09.284 --> 55:11.104
'How can you argue with that? '

55:11.104 --> 55:13.374
There's been a bit of an argument.

55:13.374 --> 55:18.564
Jeremy told the Stig
he hadn't tried hard enough
in his Mercedes on the fast lap.

55:18.564 --> 55:22.624
The Stig said the Mercedes
was too wayward and uncontrollable.

55:22.624 --> 55:27.714
Jeremy said rubbish -
he could hit an apple on the apex
of any corner at full speed.

55:27.714 --> 55:32.595
So, here's the apple, and here comes,
I imagine, a very big crash.

55:38.924 --> 55:41.634
SCREECHING

55:41.634 --> 55:43.124
Damn! I'll go again.

55:45.624 --> 55:47.763
SCREECHING

55:50.924 --> 55:52.624
SCREECHING

55:52.624 --> 55:55.639
The important thing is,
Jeremy won't get bored.

55:57.724 --> 55:59.924
SCREECHING

55:59.924 --> 56:02.336
Actually, I did.

56:06.544 --> 56:08.819
LAUGHTER

56:10.994 --> 56:16.796
I'll bet you Stig couldn't do it
in your car. Don't have that bet.
I would eat it if he could hit it.

56:20.064 --> 56:22.134
SCREECHING

56:34.004 --> 56:35.874
The great taste of Michelin.

56:35.874 --> 56:39.174
There was another issue
with the mad Merc.

56:39.174 --> 56:42.084
Whoa! That's canvas showing!

56:42.084 --> 56:46.954
Hang on, your rear tyres lasted...
how long? 35 miles.

56:46.954 --> 56:51.614
That's going to be inconvenient
if you live 40 miles from work.

57:46.814 --> 57:50.094
We left Stig to his holiday
and headed for home,

57:50.094 --> 57:53.803
still unable to agree
which of our cars was the best.

58:04.174 --> 58:09.614
On the way, we tried each other's
cars, and that made things worse.

58:09.614 --> 58:14.334
This Audi is just a very,
very nice place to be.

58:14.334 --> 58:19.574
That four-wheel drive system, after
all of our two-wheel drive lairiness,

58:19.574 --> 58:22.974
suddenly to have that security,
that planted feel,

58:22.974 --> 58:25.374
it does make sense.

58:30.494 --> 58:32.814
This Mercedes is pretty revolting.

58:32.814 --> 58:36.974
It's really chintzy and glitzy
and cheesy and...

58:36.974 --> 58:40.751
It has a very exciting engine,
though.

58:42.434 --> 58:45.824
Tremendous engine, in fact.
It's fantastic.

58:48.344 --> 58:54.344
To annoy Hammond, I dressed like an
M3 driver before taking the wheel.

58:54.344 --> 59:00.374
The thing is, we're not reviewing
the people who buy this car,
we're reviewing the car.

59:00.374 --> 59:07.655
When Richard Hammond says it's
poised and balanced and precise,
he is talking absolute... sense.

59:08.704 --> 59:11.134
What a car!

59:11.134 --> 59:12.499
What a masterpiece!

59:13.914 --> 59:16.624
So, sublime,

59:16.624 --> 59:19.014
civilised,

59:19.014 --> 59:21.094
insane.

59:21.094 --> 59:24.109
All slightly different,
but, truth be told...

59:25.614 --> 59:28.833
.. all absolutely brilliant!
