00:39.298 --> 00:41.764
<i>Incident
Command, this is Redding 5</i>

00:41.766 --> 00:45.069
<i>approaching a timber fire
off Route 16.</i>

00:45.071 --> 00:47.004
<i>We've got a high rate
of spread on this one,</i>

00:47.006 --> 00:49.874
<i>with a line of cars that are
blocking emergency vehicles,</i>

00:49.876 --> 00:52.144
<i>so we're gonna send in
the jumpers on the left flank.</i>

00:54.046 --> 00:56.514
<i>Approaching drop zone now.</i>

00:58.885 --> 01:01.551
Honey, it's really bad.
I don't know when...

01:01.553 --> 01:03.287
We're trapped.
We can't get out.

01:03.289 --> 01:04.420
What do we do now?

01:04.422 --> 01:05.722
We need a miracle.

01:11.496 --> 01:13.030
- Where? Oh!
- Look!

01:23.175 --> 01:24.842
Where's my Redding Crew at?

01:24.844 --> 01:26.542
Everywhere!

01:26.544 --> 01:29.246
Road's backed up for miles and we
need to get emergency teams in here.

01:29.248 --> 01:32.448
But right now our job is to keep
that fire from those vehicles.

01:32.450 --> 01:35.052
Alpha Team, cut a line upslope
and prep for a burn.

01:35.054 --> 01:36.419
Yes, sir!

01:36.421 --> 01:38.889
Beta Team,
stay close to me.

01:38.891 --> 01:41.058
Love being close
to you, Supe.

01:41.060 --> 01:43.726
In the words of
Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf,

01:43.728 --> 01:46.429
"If you can't take the heat,
get out the kitchen!"

01:46.431 --> 01:47.865
Not even close.

01:47.867 --> 01:50.836
Let's disagree to agree,
'cause quotes are my thing.

01:57.143 --> 01:58.275
Oh!

02:05.750 --> 02:08.285
Fire's gonna do
a 180 off the line!

02:08.287 --> 02:10.220
Supe! Laser!

02:10.222 --> 02:12.557
Alpha Team! Move! Move!

02:14.961 --> 02:18.795
It's getting real warm
down here. Got me?

02:18.797 --> 02:20.064
<i>Roger that.</i>

02:20.066 --> 02:22.032
Two... One...

02:22.034 --> 02:23.135
Paint it pink!

02:29.875 --> 02:33.946
Whoo! I love the smell
of PHOS-CHEK in the morning!

02:34.413 --> 02:36.180
Whoa!

02:36.182 --> 02:38.082
Whoa, whoa, you okay?

02:41.287 --> 02:42.487
I'm good. I'm good.

02:48.427 --> 02:50.227
Thank you for...

02:53.698 --> 02:56.666
You are the bravest man
I've ever seen.

02:56.668 --> 02:59.569
- And the hottest.
- Thank you, ma'am. But for us,

02:59.571 --> 03:01.205
it's just another day
at the office.

03:03.342 --> 03:06.043
My husband sells insurance!

03:06.045 --> 03:08.014
Take me with you!

03:09.581 --> 03:12.082
I'm literally standing
right here.

03:26.499 --> 03:28.399
Hey, hey, hey, guys!

03:28.401 --> 03:30.034
My dawgs, come on,
come on.

03:30.036 --> 03:32.136
You crushed it out there,
men. You crushed it!

03:34.306 --> 03:35.839
Man, I am so sorry, Supe.

03:35.841 --> 03:38.242
The guys were just blowing off steam.
I apologize.

03:38.244 --> 03:40.710
There will be time for
steam reallocation later.

03:40.712 --> 03:44.181
Our main priority
is to get this depot tip-top.

03:44.183 --> 03:47.484
Gentlemen, you know how
quickly things can go sideways.

03:47.486 --> 03:51.554
Heck, my dad was the greatest smokejumper
ever to hang boots in this depot.

03:57.463 --> 03:58.663
Oh.

04:00.765 --> 04:02.634
Mmm, I don't know.

04:11.310 --> 04:12.311
Now I got it.

04:13.412 --> 04:14.679
Sliver!

04:19.017 --> 04:21.651
That is...
That is in there.

04:21.653 --> 04:23.954
Gentlemen, we must be
at our very best...

04:23.956 --> 04:26.190
...every second
of every day!

04:26.192 --> 04:29.725
Exactly. Now,
where's my Redding Crew at?

04:29.727 --> 04:31.230
Everywhere!

04:34.900 --> 04:36.166
- <i>Commander Richards.</i>
- <i>Mmm.</i>

04:36.168 --> 04:38.268
<i>The way you and your men
put out that fire today,</i>

04:38.270 --> 04:41.240
<i>it felt like it was really
the work of superheroes.</i>

04:41.673 --> 04:42.973
<i>"Superheroes"?</i>

04:42.975 --> 04:44.508
That's the Santa Barbara fire!

04:44.510 --> 04:47.177
<i>No.
We're just men with a lot a training,</i>

04:47.179 --> 04:51.048
<i>very strict exercise regimens,
and first-class genetics.</i>

04:51.050 --> 04:54.384
<i>Now that I say it out loud,
I guess we are superheroes.</i>

04:54.386 --> 04:57.054
<i>After a storied
career as Division Commander,</i>

04:57.056 --> 04:59.189
<i>rumor has it you're
considering retirement.</i>

04:59.191 --> 05:01.358
- <i>Care to comment?</i>
- <i>The rumors are true.</i>

05:01.360 --> 05:04.128
You should be the next Division Commander.
You've been training for this

05:04.130 --> 05:06.964
since you were saving
LEGO people from LEGO fires.

05:06.966 --> 05:08.465
It's what my dad
and I always dreamed of.

05:08.467 --> 05:10.800
<i>...the
ability to put a fire out.</i>

05:10.802 --> 05:12.369
<i>Commander Richards,
are you afraid of anything?</i>

05:12.371 --> 05:13.437
Uh, Supe?

05:13.439 --> 05:15.873
<i>No, I'm not afraid
of anything.</i>

05:15.875 --> 05:19.343
<i>Except for mice.
They're a little creepy.</i>

05:19.345 --> 05:20.844
- Supe.
- What?

05:20.846 --> 05:23.679
Sorry, Supe. We're gonna
join the Santa Barbara crew.

05:23.681 --> 05:24.948
We just want to be
in the big leagues.

05:24.950 --> 05:28.018
What... You are
so in the big leagues!

05:28.020 --> 05:31.088
Were you not in that fire?
I just singed my eyebrows!

05:31.090 --> 05:33.192
Smell my beard,
it smells like a luau.

05:38.230 --> 05:40.230
That was disturbing.

05:40.232 --> 05:42.332
Axe, you coming with us?

05:44.203 --> 05:47.171
Ha! Ha! Go! Go!

05:47.173 --> 05:50.007
Go, get out of here!
Get out of here, you backstabbers.

05:50.009 --> 05:53.343
If you had a fraternity,
I wouldn't even join it!

05:53.345 --> 05:54.679
Can you even step?

05:59.952 --> 06:02.818
Huh? We don't need you!

06:02.820 --> 06:07.891
We... don't... need... you!

06:07.893 --> 06:09.293
We need them.
We need them, Chief.

06:09.295 --> 06:11.727
We just lost three of our
best jumpers and our pilot.

06:11.729 --> 06:13.363
Come on, man.
What's the backup plan?

06:13.365 --> 06:14.431
We're gonna do
what we always do.

06:14.433 --> 06:15.499
Tidy up the depot?

06:15.501 --> 06:17.767
We stay vigilant.
Rely on our training.

06:17.769 --> 06:19.802
Although,
that's gonna mean that...

06:19.804 --> 06:22.372
I'm gonna have to fly.

06:22.374 --> 06:24.141
I don't know if I'm ready
for that, I mean...

06:24.143 --> 06:26.310
I was much more comfortable
being the backup pilot.

06:26.312 --> 06:28.178
I'm really not suited
for a leadership role,

06:28.180 --> 06:30.080
- right at this moment.
- Congratulations.

06:30.082 --> 06:33.183
You've been called up.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.954
But, Supe...
Oh, man.

06:38.490 --> 06:40.557
Fire down by the lake.

06:40.559 --> 06:42.492
Relax, guys. Relax.

06:42.494 --> 06:43.927
They don't even need us.

06:43.929 --> 06:46.129
Local team says there's this
massive storm coming here,

06:46.131 --> 06:49.066
and it's just gonna...
Let it burn out.

06:49.068 --> 06:51.435
So there's no need
to be nervous, or...

06:51.437 --> 06:53.103
Just relax, stay cool.

06:53.105 --> 06:55.307
Lieutenant, there's cabins
down by that lake.

06:56.575 --> 06:58.542
<i>I'm looking for
the best of the best.</i>

06:58.544 --> 07:01.211
<i>Someone who knows what a fire's
gonna do before it does it.</i>

07:01.213 --> 07:03.313
If you're worried about it,
we could just go down there

07:03.315 --> 07:04.881
and check it out, right?

07:04.883 --> 07:08.085
<i>Whoever takes over the position is
going to be almost as great as me.</i>

07:08.087 --> 07:09.353
We need eyes on the ground.

07:09.355 --> 07:11.121
Call Dr. Hicks!

07:11.123 --> 07:12.456
Didn't you guys go
on a few dates?

07:12.458 --> 07:13.789
Dates? No.

07:13.791 --> 07:17.961
There were two or three occurrences
where we sat together for chow.

07:17.963 --> 07:20.831
- Oh, so, dates.
- We're professionals.

07:20.833 --> 07:22.866
I decided that our spending
time together

07:22.868 --> 07:24.401
- <i>was taking me away from this.</i>
- <i>Supe...</i>

07:24.403 --> 07:27.504
- <i>So I chose to press pause.</i>
- In the middle of our date?

07:27.506 --> 07:29.072
Dr. Hicks!

07:29.074 --> 07:30.941
<i>What's the problem,
Superintendent Carson?</i>

07:30.943 --> 07:32.476
<i>Why do you assume
there's a problem?</i>

07:32.478 --> 07:34.411
<i>Unless you're calling three
months later to apologize</i>

07:34.413 --> 07:36.546
<i>for going to the bathroom
during our dinner</i>

07:36.548 --> 07:37.813
<i>and never coming back.</i>

07:37.815 --> 07:39.018
Oh, no, she didn't.

07:40.953 --> 07:42.785
<i>I am sorry.
I will go over here.</i>

07:44.923 --> 07:46.189
<i>Okay, there's a problem.</i>

07:46.191 --> 07:47.924
I need you to bring up
your cameras.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.361
<i>There's a fire
down by the lake.</i>

07:52.031 --> 07:54.131
There. Zoom in
on that cabin. Right there.

07:54.133 --> 07:57.367
<i>Oh, no. Oh, I see it.
I see that the...</i>

07:57.369 --> 07:58.935
With a storm coming in,
there is no way

07:58.937 --> 08:01.638
the local depot
is gonna make it.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.740
Get the chopper ready.

08:03.742 --> 08:05.008
- Where's my Redding Crew at?
- Everywhere!

08:05.010 --> 08:06.743
Everywhere.

08:06.745 --> 08:07.911
Chopper flies in five.

08:11.083 --> 08:13.483
Oh, look,
we're off the ground.

08:13.485 --> 08:14.520
So far, so good.

08:18.590 --> 08:21.160
All right. Deploying
the Bambi... Now.

08:28.867 --> 08:30.269
Carson!

08:34.006 --> 08:37.943
All right, heads up, guys.
Confirming fire structure.

08:40.879 --> 08:43.080
Three thousand pounds
of water coming at you.

08:43.082 --> 08:45.384
Dropping the water... Now!

08:49.688 --> 08:51.455
Okay, uh, nice try.

08:51.457 --> 08:52.956
Can you try being
a little more supportive?

08:52.958 --> 08:54.925
I haven't flown
in a while, okay?

08:54.927 --> 08:56.727
Supe, you want me
to double back to the lake?

08:56.729 --> 08:57.961
No, ditch the bucket.

08:57.963 --> 08:59.365
Give me a line.

09:01.800 --> 09:02.866
- Good?
- You're good.

09:02.868 --> 09:04.136
Hold her steady!

09:13.847 --> 09:15.581
You're ten feet from there.

09:23.889 --> 09:25.257
Proceeding with room check.

09:28.293 --> 09:29.294
Clear!

09:32.498 --> 09:34.197
<i>I love you.</i>

09:34.199 --> 09:37.033
- Bunny!
- I will get you another one.

09:37.035 --> 09:39.669
- Bunny.
- Zoey...

09:39.671 --> 09:41.972
I got three civilians in the
bravo side of the structure.

09:41.974 --> 09:44.574
- You hurt?
- Are you really a fireman?

09:44.576 --> 09:47.477
I'm a smokejumper, which is like
a firefighter, but way cooler.

09:47.479 --> 09:48.345
What does a smokejumper do?

09:48.347 --> 09:50.113
We jump into fires
to fight them.

09:50.115 --> 09:51.281
Firemen fight fires.

09:51.283 --> 09:52.884
Yeah, but there's
over a million firefighters,

09:52.886 --> 09:54.718
there's only 336 smokejumpers.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.253
A million's more than 300.

09:56.255 --> 09:58.488
In this case, less is more.
Listen, stop! I don't have time.

09:58.490 --> 10:00.524
- Where are your parents?
- They're not here.

10:00.526 --> 10:01.958
I can't get ahold of them.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.293
Okay, fine. I'm getting
you out, one by one.

10:03.295 --> 10:05.061
- You first. Let's go.
- Take Will first.

10:05.063 --> 10:08.064
No. Take Zoey,
then Brynn, then me.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.499
No. Zoey, then you, then me.

10:09.501 --> 10:12.035
No. No, we do what
I say and we do it now!

10:12.037 --> 10:14.271
Copy that.
We're a go for extraction.

10:14.273 --> 10:15.707
No. Wait... Wait!

10:17.409 --> 10:18.410
Stop!

10:21.213 --> 10:23.148
- Wait!
- The button, it's jammed.

10:24.316 --> 10:25.350
Release!

10:26.652 --> 10:28.720
Stop!

10:29.188 --> 10:30.554
Ooh.

10:30.556 --> 10:32.656
This must be why there are
so few smokejumpers.

10:32.658 --> 10:36.161
All right. Let's try this again.
Come on, come on, come on.

10:38.730 --> 10:40.163
- Oh, no!
- Whoa!

10:40.165 --> 10:42.332
I'm gonna clip us all together,
and we all go at once. Okay?

10:42.334 --> 10:43.335
Bunny!

10:43.870 --> 10:45.035
Go now!

10:45.037 --> 10:47.137
- "Now," now?
- Yes, he said now!

10:47.139 --> 10:48.906
Well, he said
"now" before!

10:48.908 --> 10:50.373
What if he changes
his mind again?

10:50.375 --> 10:53.278
- He's not gonna change his mind!
- Hey, guys, focus! Now!

11:05.892 --> 11:09.059
It's the Channel Six
news team!

11:09.061 --> 11:12.631
<i>Folks,
we are witnessing a live aerial rescue.</i>

11:18.303 --> 11:21.037
Take the children to St.
Stephen's for medical eval.

11:21.039 --> 11:23.740
- Copy that.
- But why? We're fine.

11:23.742 --> 11:25.208
Protocol.

11:25.210 --> 11:27.244
Hey, Supe.
Storm's on top of us.

11:27.246 --> 11:28.712
Winds are at 20 knots.

11:28.714 --> 11:31.581
I need to set down, now!

11:31.583 --> 11:35.320
Fine. Head back to the depot.
We'll evaluate 'em there.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.961
What the heck are three eight-year-olds
doing alone in the middle of nowhere?

11:43.963 --> 11:45.762
Eight? I'm not eight.

11:45.764 --> 11:49.801
Hey! If he says you're
eight, you're eight.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.838
Where's the pole?
Can I slide down the pole?

11:53.840 --> 11:57.674
- Depot's one floor. No pole.
- Do you have a hook and ladder?

11:57.676 --> 11:59.376
Hook and ladder? No.

11:59.378 --> 12:01.545
What kind of firefighter
are you?

12:01.547 --> 12:02.779
I told you.

12:02.781 --> 12:06.451
I'm a smokejumper,
which, again, is way better.

12:07.119 --> 12:08.685
Where are your parents?

12:08.687 --> 12:10.287
They went up
the coast for a night

12:10.289 --> 12:11.354
for their 20th anniversary.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.356
And I'm extremely responsible.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.727
I've kept these two out of
trouble their entire lives.

12:16.595 --> 12:18.463
- Hey!
- Whoo!

12:19.966 --> 12:21.665
Yeah, I can see that.

12:21.667 --> 12:23.302
Put that down.

12:24.069 --> 12:25.502
No shenanigans on my watch!

12:25.504 --> 12:28.638
Yeah, no monkeyshines,
tomfoolery, or hijinks.

12:28.640 --> 12:29.539
You finished?

12:29.541 --> 12:31.741
As long as there's not
a hint of malarkey.

12:31.743 --> 12:32.977
Whoa!

12:32.979 --> 12:34.845
Now, if I didn't know
any better,

12:34.847 --> 12:36.746
I would say that
that was sarcasm.

12:36.748 --> 12:40.017
So why don't we just take it
down a notch, sister, okay?

12:40.019 --> 12:42.987
Maybe a little gratitude
would be helpful.

12:42.989 --> 12:46.289
Sorry, bud, we just don't
speak oldsey-timesy.

12:46.291 --> 12:49.326
Oh, my gosh.
But she's not stopping.

12:49.328 --> 12:52.696
It's just... That's just sarcasm, right?
I mean, that's not just me, right?

12:52.698 --> 12:54.999
- It's just sarcasm.
- No, it's not just you. I just...

12:55.001 --> 12:56.733
- I felt it now, little miss.
- Wow!

12:56.735 --> 13:00.071
Gentlemen. I got this.

13:00.073 --> 13:02.238
My name isn't "bud"
or "man" or "dude."

13:02.240 --> 13:04.107
It is Superintendent
Jake Carson.

13:04.109 --> 13:07.644
But you can call me that.
The whole thing.

13:07.646 --> 13:12.016
This is Captain Mark Rogers.
Lieutenant Rodrigo Torres.

13:12.018 --> 13:14.852
And that is Axe.

13:14.854 --> 13:17.253
Hi, Axe.

13:17.255 --> 13:18.488
Does he always
carry that axe?

13:18.490 --> 13:20.590
Yeah, 'cause he's always
ready to roll.

13:20.592 --> 13:25.261
All right, all right.
What's your mom's number?

13:25.263 --> 13:27.230
You can't just
cold call my mom.

13:27.232 --> 13:28.431
What do you think
she's gonna do

13:28.433 --> 13:30.001
when she sees the caller ID
from a fire station

13:30.003 --> 13:32.270
and finds out her cabin
burned down?

13:33.438 --> 13:35.805
- I'll call her.
- Fine.

13:35.807 --> 13:37.877
Set it up, and you hand it
right over to me.

13:40.812 --> 13:43.480
It's straight to voicemail.

13:43.482 --> 13:47.484
Hey, Mom, please don't worry.
We're all totally fine...

13:47.486 --> 13:52.322
But I'm so sorry to tell you
that the cabin burned down.

13:52.324 --> 13:54.859
We were rescued
by these smokejumpers,

13:54.861 --> 13:57.661
which I've heard are actually
way cooler than firemen.

13:57.663 --> 14:00.430
Apparently, there's only 339
of them in the entire country.

14:00.432 --> 14:03.633
Three hundred thirty-six.
And this, when you do that...

14:03.635 --> 14:05.237
That's not helpful.

14:06.204 --> 14:09.305
So, we couldn't be
in safer hands.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.775
I guess you can
take your time.

14:11.777 --> 14:13.677
No! No, no.

14:13.679 --> 14:17.081
Hello, ma'am. Uh...
Hello, ma'am.

14:17.083 --> 14:19.284
- Hello, ma'am?
- It's still a voicemail.

14:21.087 --> 14:24.688
This is Superintendent Jake Carson
of Redding Depot, Region Five.

14:24.690 --> 14:25.689
I have your children.

14:25.691 --> 14:27.190
They are physically unharmed,
but I must say

14:27.192 --> 14:28.758
they are a bit of a handful.

14:28.760 --> 14:32.562
Please call me back ASAP to make
arrangements to come pick them up.

14:32.564 --> 14:34.197
Thank you.

14:34.199 --> 14:36.766
Have a... Have a great
rest of the day.

14:39.538 --> 14:41.237
That doesn't make
any sense, unless...

14:41.239 --> 14:42.441
Oh, yeah...

14:46.611 --> 14:48.511
Lieutenant,
how bad's the storm?

14:48.513 --> 14:51.015
Well, in the words
of Mahatma Gandhi,

14:51.017 --> 14:52.850
"It's bad.
Real, real bad."

14:52.852 --> 14:56.653
Nope. Not even one thing
about that was right.

14:56.655 --> 14:58.956
Why you got to go and
blow up my spot like that?

14:58.958 --> 15:00.024
I wouldn't...

15:00.026 --> 15:01.558
Can we make it
to the police station?

15:01.560 --> 15:04.594
Chief, it's 90 miles.
The roads are all flooded.

15:04.596 --> 15:06.563
You don't want to
take the kids out in that.

15:06.565 --> 15:09.133
What about
the Safe Haven Law?

15:09.135 --> 15:13.436
As first responders, we're legally bound
for the health and welfare of the children

15:13.438 --> 15:17.007
until they're relinquished
to a legal guardian.

15:17.009 --> 15:18.109
Of course.

15:18.111 --> 15:19.442
I know what
the Safe Haven Law is.

15:19.444 --> 15:21.846
Well, see? See, it's a good
thing the Alpha Team quit

15:21.848 --> 15:25.648
'cause now we got all this spare
room for the kids to sleep in. Huh?

15:25.650 --> 15:29.454
Yeah. Lucky us.

15:29.889 --> 15:30.955
Let's do this.

15:30.957 --> 15:32.789
Hey, guys!
This hose can reach...

15:32.791 --> 15:33.792
Attention, everyone...

15:35.327 --> 15:37.027
Man down. I'm coming, Supe!

15:37.029 --> 15:38.030
Whoa!

15:39.664 --> 15:42.400
This depot is
not a playground!

15:48.607 --> 15:51.075
"Got your message.
Thank you.

15:51.077 --> 15:52.575
"There is really
spotty service here.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.344
"We're stuck due to the storm,

15:54.346 --> 15:57.081
"but we will set out
first thing in the morning.

15:57.083 --> 15:59.049
"Thank you again from the
bottom of our hearts."

15:59.051 --> 16:00.920
That was a message
from your mom.

16:01.187 --> 16:03.187
Mama!

16:03.189 --> 16:05.122
No hugs.

16:05.124 --> 16:07.690
I'm legally bound to take care of
you, so that's what I'm gonna do.

16:07.692 --> 16:10.861
In turn, you're gonna ditch
the attitude and be obedient,

16:10.863 --> 16:12.196
so we can do our job.

16:12.198 --> 16:13.596
Fighting fires.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.166
Why does it have to be
"fighting" the fires?

16:15.168 --> 16:18.535
Can't it just be "containing"
it or "resolving" it?

16:18.537 --> 16:20.739
Oh, my gosh!
For crying out loud.

16:23.142 --> 16:24.774
I can no longer
hold my tongue.

16:24.776 --> 16:29.479
So what needs to happen right
now, like literally, this second,

16:29.481 --> 16:31.481
is you gotta watch your tone,
little sister.

16:31.483 --> 16:34.553
Or what?

16:45.330 --> 16:47.965
"Or what?" "Or what?"

16:47.967 --> 16:49.734
Hot!

16:50.802 --> 16:52.470
"Or what?"

16:53.072 --> 16:54.573
"Or what?"

16:55.674 --> 16:56.976
<i>Por que?</i>

16:58.077 --> 17:00.010
I'm...

17:02.414 --> 17:03.613
Oh, I know what.

17:03.615 --> 17:06.749
Oh, Masher!

17:13.657 --> 17:15.226
No! No!

17:18.263 --> 17:19.698
Sit.

17:25.037 --> 17:26.137
Good doggy.

17:27.073 --> 17:28.738
What... What just happened?

17:28.740 --> 17:30.609
I think the baby
broke your dog.

17:31.944 --> 17:33.576
Sparkle Pony.

17:33.578 --> 17:34.744
Her name's Masher.

17:34.746 --> 17:37.248
- Sparkle Pony.
- Her name is Masher.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.750
Sparkle Pony!

17:40.319 --> 17:41.718
Okay...

17:41.720 --> 17:43.519
- Can you pass me the remote?
- Hey.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.957
That's Supe's chair.

17:46.859 --> 17:50.526
Uh-uh, what?
No, no, no, that's mine.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.562
- Good.
- "Good"?

17:54.934 --> 17:56.033
What?

17:56.035 --> 18:01.038
This is the
most amazing chair ever!

18:01.040 --> 18:02.907
That is not for children.

18:02.909 --> 18:05.876
- A chair isn't for children?
- Nothing here is for children.

18:05.878 --> 18:08.312
Listen, Jake,
it's been a long day.

18:08.314 --> 18:09.712
Why don't you just
point me to the kitchen?

18:09.714 --> 18:11.315
I'll make 'em some dinner,
and we'll stay out of your hair.

18:11.317 --> 18:14.584
Wait a minute, if there's gonna
be any cooking done around here,

18:14.586 --> 18:17.221
it's gonna be done by <i>moi.</i>

18:17.223 --> 18:19.091
That's French for "chef,"
by the way.

18:19.824 --> 18:20.690
No, it's not.

18:20.692 --> 18:22.293
No, it's a great idea.

18:22.295 --> 18:23.660
Lieutenant,
show her the kitchen.

18:23.662 --> 18:25.762
Rest of the depot's
off-limits, are we clear?

18:25.764 --> 18:26.798
Crystal.

18:29.201 --> 18:32.102
Don't you touch that button.
Don't you touch the...

18:32.104 --> 18:33.337
Don't you do it.

18:33.339 --> 18:35.205
Don't press it.

18:35.207 --> 18:38.010
I pressed it.

18:38.978 --> 18:41.513
Stupid Safe Haven Law.

18:46.052 --> 18:49.019
Redding Depot. Superintendent
Jake Carson speaking.

18:49.021 --> 18:52.289
<i>Hey, Supe, just checking
to make sure you're okay.</i>

18:52.291 --> 18:54.724
<i>You look worse than you did
after we spent nine days</i>

18:54.726 --> 18:56.226
<i>fighting the Gaucho fire.</i>

18:56.228 --> 18:57.328
I'm fine.

18:57.330 --> 18:58.896
<i>Are you sure?</i>

18:58.898 --> 19:01.233
<i>'Cause you always tap your fingers
like that when you're upset.</i>

19:07.106 --> 19:08.207
Hi.

19:11.609 --> 19:15.480
There was just a couple other things
I wanted to say about the fact that...

19:18.951 --> 19:20.750
Okay, call me again,

19:20.752 --> 19:22.485
<i>and I promise
I will come out there...</i>

19:22.487 --> 19:24.654
Excuse me?

19:24.656 --> 19:28.125
What kind of way is that to answer
a phone at a federal fire facility?

19:28.127 --> 19:31.261
<i>Tell Superintendent Carson I
need to speak to him immediately.</i>

19:31.263 --> 19:34.066
<i>Tell him it's
Commander Bill Richards.</i>

19:36.836 --> 19:38.270
Please hold.

19:43.009 --> 19:45.476
Superintendent
Jake Carson speaking.

19:45.478 --> 19:47.144
<i>How can I help you, Commander?</i>

19:47.146 --> 19:50.914
I was working a Class F
in southern Idaho,

19:50.916 --> 19:53.716
and someone forwards me a
video of one of my smokejumpers

19:53.718 --> 19:55.886
<i>being pulled
into a Huey.</i>

19:55.888 --> 19:57.855
Sir, about that...
I apologize.

19:57.857 --> 20:01.892
<i>For what? Being in beast mode
on national television?</i>

20:01.894 --> 20:04.862
<i>Great optics
for the department, Carson.</i>

20:04.864 --> 20:06.397
All in a day's work, sir.

20:06.399 --> 20:08.767
I understand
you're Dan Carson's boy.

20:09.801 --> 20:11.869
<i>He was a world-class
smokejumper.</i>

20:11.871 --> 20:14.271
Died in that blaze
in Yosemite, as I recall.

20:14.273 --> 20:19.309
No greater honor for a smokejumper
than burning to a crisp.

20:19.311 --> 20:20.878
Would've preferred
he didn't die, sir.

20:20.880 --> 20:25.482
As you're aware,
I have to pick my successor.

20:25.484 --> 20:28.185
Mandatory retirement.

20:28.187 --> 20:31.855
But after last night's heroics,
you've made my short list

20:31.857 --> 20:33.758
for Division Commander.

20:35.394 --> 20:38.028
That's fantastic, sir! I...

20:38.030 --> 20:41.800
It would be my privilege to carry
on your legacy after you're gone.

20:42.301 --> 20:44.070
Say what? "Gone"?

20:45.304 --> 20:47.570
I'm not dying.
I'm never dying.

20:47.572 --> 20:50.908
And if I do die, that's because
everybody else is dead, too.

20:50.910 --> 20:53.776
But yes, uh, what I meant
was when you retire.

20:53.778 --> 20:57.381
Slow your roll, cowboy!

20:57.383 --> 20:59.615
<i>It's not your job yet.</i>

20:59.617 --> 21:03.487
I'm sure you wouldn't mind me
coming down there Monday morning

21:03.489 --> 21:05.289
and seeing how
you run your shop.

21:05.291 --> 21:06.622
It'd be my honor, sir.

21:06.624 --> 21:09.226
<i>I'll have my office
e-mail the application.</i>

21:09.228 --> 21:10.693
Make it official.

21:10.695 --> 21:12.031
I'll see you Monday.

21:13.365 --> 21:14.431
Yeah!

21:14.433 --> 21:15.765
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:33.319 --> 21:34.518
Yeah!

21:34.520 --> 21:36.322
- Where did you come from?
- Supe...

21:36.754 --> 21:38.654
This is huge!

21:38.656 --> 21:43.861
You are going to have every
single depot under your command.

21:43.863 --> 21:45.297
Nothing's official yet.

21:46.731 --> 21:49.634
Big Dan would be
so proud.

21:54.340 --> 21:55.407
Oh!

22:06.886 --> 22:08.020
No.

22:08.587 --> 22:10.120
Oh.

22:10.122 --> 22:12.322
I have to fill out the most
important application of my life.

22:12.324 --> 22:13.359
Yes, sir!

22:22.134 --> 22:23.766
You kidding me?

22:24.837 --> 22:27.803
Hey. What are you guys
doing in here?

22:27.805 --> 22:29.239
Admiring your shelving.

22:29.241 --> 22:31.575
Okay, well, anything in here
is outdated and unfit for use.

22:31.577 --> 22:33.913
You mean like
your fanny pack?

22:34.647 --> 22:35.946
This is a FUPA.

22:35.948 --> 22:37.614
Did you just say "FUPA"?

22:37.616 --> 22:40.119
"Fire Utility Pouch
Apparatus." Yes.

22:40.519 --> 22:41.684
I did.

22:45.925 --> 22:48.825
Come on, don't play that.

22:48.827 --> 22:51.397
- Sheez.
- Is this yours?

22:52.531 --> 22:54.865
This was my dad's.

22:54.867 --> 22:56.099
Used to play this thing
all the time.

22:56.101 --> 22:58.103
- Man, he loved it.
- Play!

23:00.239 --> 23:03.808
Pianos are not for playing.
I got work to do.

23:07.479 --> 23:08.813
Please stop crying!

23:09.882 --> 23:11.148
Why are you
just standing there?

23:11.150 --> 23:13.283
I've seen you wrestle
a wolverine!

23:13.285 --> 23:15.785
- What is going on out here?
- I don't know!

23:15.787 --> 23:17.955
She's broken!
I tried everything.

23:17.957 --> 23:20.723
I mean, the thing she's doing...
She's doing that!

23:20.725 --> 23:23.026
Problem?

23:23.028 --> 23:26.498
"Problem"? That. That's my problem.
Make that stop.

23:30.603 --> 23:32.171
Zoey, you're okay, huh?

23:32.737 --> 23:34.073
It's okay.

23:35.908 --> 23:38.242
Maybe don't come at her
all aggro next time.

23:38.244 --> 23:41.612
"Me fireman.
Can't turn my neck."

23:41.614 --> 23:42.713
No.

23:42.715 --> 23:44.948
That was a
good impression.

23:44.950 --> 23:47.451
Hey, guys! I found
these cool Nerf guns!

23:47.453 --> 23:49.186
Reach for the sky, cowboy.

23:49.188 --> 23:51.855
- Those aren't Nerf guns!
- Put it down!

23:51.857 --> 23:53.993
Put it down!

23:55.127 --> 23:56.195
Whoa!

23:56.662 --> 23:57.863
Ooh!

24:01.467 --> 24:03.066
Ha! You missed me!

24:08.773 --> 24:10.175
Crisis averted.

24:17.383 --> 24:19.815
I never imagined I'd have
to tell a smokejumper this,

24:19.817 --> 24:21.752
but you know the correct way
to use a fire extinguisher

24:21.754 --> 24:24.056
is you point the action end
away from you, right?

24:24.822 --> 24:26.757
Dr. Hicks.
What's your problem?

24:26.759 --> 24:28.258
Why do you think
there's a problem?

24:28.260 --> 24:31.361
You always blink really fast
when you're angry.

24:31.363 --> 24:32.865
I'm not blinking fast.

24:33.899 --> 24:35.632
But there is a problem.

24:35.634 --> 24:38.869
You dive-bombed my lab and
scooped up water from Fisher Lake.

24:38.871 --> 24:40.671
That is a protected
wildlife area.

24:40.673 --> 24:44.274
That kind of activity is devastating to
the habitat of the Western Spadefoot!

24:44.276 --> 24:47.277
Forgive me if I'm prioritizing
human life over a frog pond.

24:47.279 --> 24:49.012
- They're toads.
- It's the same thing.

24:49.014 --> 24:50.883
Like firemen
and smokejumpers?

24:53.152 --> 24:54.418
I have an agreement
with Cal Fire

24:54.420 --> 24:56.186
saying that they are not
gonna collect water

24:56.188 --> 24:57.554
from Fisher Lake
for their dumps.

24:57.556 --> 25:00.090
And now it looks like you are
gonna have to sign it, too.

25:00.092 --> 25:02.361
You know what?
You're right.

25:03.996 --> 25:05.931
You're right,
and I'm sorry.

25:06.799 --> 25:07.998
You are?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.534
- I admire what you do out there.
- You do?

25:10.536 --> 25:14.106
You're so nurturing
towards those frog... Toads.

25:15.341 --> 25:16.542
It's almost maternal.

25:17.776 --> 25:19.209
Wait, what's happening
right now?

25:19.211 --> 25:22.079
Nothing. I'm just saying that
caring for living creatures

25:22.081 --> 25:24.414
- is no small task.
- Exactly.

25:24.416 --> 25:25.882
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:25.884 --> 25:28.218
Dr. Hicks, have you ever
felt a void in your life

25:28.220 --> 25:31.421
that could be filled by one
to three small children?

25:31.423 --> 25:32.622
Wait, what?

25:32.624 --> 25:34.626
I just need your help with
a big problem that I have.

25:35.361 --> 25:36.462
Them.

25:41.100 --> 25:44.836
Why is Pinkie
Pie so mad at Rainbow Dash?

25:44.838 --> 25:49.339
She found out that Rainbow Dash was
secretly throwing away Pinkie's pies.

25:49.341 --> 25:52.809
It was so shady and unponyish,
I don't even want to go into it.

25:52.811 --> 25:54.478
How do you know that?

25:54.480 --> 25:57.080
In San Quentin, they only let
you watch three shows.

25:57.082 --> 25:59.249
Cooking, history, and kids.

25:59.251 --> 26:01.251
So now I'm an expert
in all three.

26:01.253 --> 26:03.286
Well, it all makes
sense now.

26:03.288 --> 26:05.489
- Right?
- What's San Quentin?

26:05.491 --> 26:07.991
It's a liberal arts college
in Vermont.

26:07.993 --> 26:11.461
Wait. This was much
worse a minute ago.

26:11.463 --> 26:13.897
Well, it seems like you've
got it under control now.

26:13.899 --> 26:15.465
So if you could just sign
that contract,

26:15.467 --> 26:17.869
then I can leave
and you can continue watching

26:17.871 --> 26:19.636
<i>My Little Pony</i>
with your friends.

26:19.638 --> 26:20.704
You don't understand.

26:20.706 --> 26:23.006
I am stuck
with these kids overnight.

26:23.008 --> 26:25.411
I was hoping that
maybe you would know how

26:26.412 --> 26:27.646
to take care of them.

26:28.347 --> 26:29.913
Because...

26:29.915 --> 26:32.516
Because I am a woman?

26:32.518 --> 26:34.353
No... No! No.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.188
No!

26:36.922 --> 26:38.388
You're a scientist

26:38.390 --> 26:40.123
who knows how to care
for living creatures.

26:40.125 --> 26:43.460
So it's my scientific opinion
you're looking for.

26:43.462 --> 26:46.062
- Yes!
- Well, in my scientific opinion,

26:46.064 --> 26:48.033
you're a terrible liar.

26:50.569 --> 26:51.937
Pants on fire.

26:55.441 --> 26:56.506
Come on!

26:56.508 --> 26:58.742
I have devoted half of
my life to my career.

26:58.744 --> 27:01.178
I am a well-respected
field scientist!

27:01.180 --> 27:04.681
I am not some pushover that
you can get to babysit for you!

27:04.683 --> 27:08.318
If you can survive in the epicenter
of a raging wildfire for days on end,

27:08.320 --> 27:10.722
you can handle a few kids
for one night.

27:17.897 --> 27:20.432
It's pouring rain out.
Get inside!

27:22.634 --> 27:24.234
Hey.

27:24.236 --> 27:25.604
What were you doing
out there?

27:26.638 --> 27:27.771
I saw the door open.

27:27.773 --> 27:30.609
I just was wondering where you were.

27:33.645 --> 27:35.045
I appreciate the concern.

27:35.047 --> 27:36.982
The outside, off-limits.

27:39.853 --> 27:41.218
- That your girlfriend?
- No.

27:41.220 --> 27:43.253
She's an angry scientist I
thought I could unload you on.

27:43.255 --> 27:45.322
- But you like her.
- No, I don't.

27:45.324 --> 27:47.959
- She definitely likes you.
- No, she doesn't.

27:47.961 --> 27:50.160
Wait... She does?

27:50.162 --> 27:51.495
Who cares? What?

27:51.497 --> 27:53.163
See? You do like her.

27:53.165 --> 27:55.632
- Do you love her?
- Kisses!

27:58.770 --> 28:00.670
- Ooh!
- Not funny!

28:00.672 --> 28:02.138
- I'm sorry.
- It is not funny.

28:02.140 --> 28:03.675
All right, bedtime!

28:07.546 --> 28:08.645
Pick a bed.

28:08.647 --> 28:09.947
I forgot my jammers.

28:09.949 --> 28:11.515
Is that Dr. Hicks?

28:11.517 --> 28:14.384
Oh, sorry. That's mine.

28:14.386 --> 28:16.722
- Cool.
- Oh, yeah, that's mine, too.

28:18.257 --> 28:20.023
- What's that?
- Um...

28:20.025 --> 28:21.893
Oh, that's not mine.

28:21.895 --> 28:24.196
It's not mine.
But I'll take it.

28:27.499 --> 28:29.299
We've recently
had a few vacancies,

28:29.301 --> 28:31.234
so you can quietly stay here
until the morning.

28:31.236 --> 28:33.303
Your concern for us
is really touching, Jake.

28:33.305 --> 28:36.172
Superintendent Jake Carson.

28:36.174 --> 28:38.343
Alexa, play BTS.

28:39.913 --> 28:42.147
Alexa, play BTS.

28:43.348 --> 28:46.182
- What are you doing?
- Your Alexa's broken.

28:46.184 --> 28:47.452
That's a clock.

28:48.922 --> 28:50.086
Go to bed.

28:50.088 --> 28:52.255
I don't want to see
any of you until 0600.

28:52.257 --> 28:53.991
We're not
in the military.

28:53.993 --> 28:55.358
Don't you remember
what it's like to be a kid?

28:55.360 --> 28:57.028
Of course I do.
That corner over there

28:57.030 --> 28:58.461
is where I did my first
one-handed pushup.

28:58.463 --> 29:00.764
Learned to fold my dad's parachute
in that bunk right there.

29:00.766 --> 29:03.433
Christmas intermittent fasting.
Sprints till exhaustion.

29:03.435 --> 29:04.869
Speculating on
banana futures.

29:04.871 --> 29:06.770
I've been training here
since I was four years old.

29:17.316 --> 29:20.517
- Why does she keep doing that?
- I don't know. Babies cry.

29:20.519 --> 29:22.352
I didn't cry.
I never cried.

29:22.354 --> 29:24.621
- You've never cried?
- No.

29:24.623 --> 29:25.789
And you're proud of it?

29:28.193 --> 29:29.461
I get sad...

29:30.128 --> 29:31.761
I just don't
show my emotions

29:31.763 --> 29:34.564
with water dripping out
of my eyes and making...

29:34.566 --> 29:36.666
Somebody quiet her down,
for Pete's sake!

29:36.668 --> 29:38.268
Lullaby! Lullaby!

29:38.270 --> 29:41.605
It's weird. She usually only
likes lullabies from our dad.

29:41.607 --> 29:42.539
Lullaby! Lullaby!

29:42.541 --> 29:44.140
It'll work a lot better
if you do it.

29:44.142 --> 29:45.777
- Lullaby! Lullaby!
- Okay!

29:52.217 --> 29:53.585
Uh, this...

29:54.921 --> 29:56.188
Lullaby, uh...

29:58.190 --> 30:01.159
I'm trying to think
of one... Nope. No.

30:03.195 --> 30:06.131
There once was a man
from Nantucket. He...

30:07.132 --> 30:09.900
That's a limerick.
That's not a lullaby.

30:09.902 --> 30:11.334
I'm not gonna use that.

30:11.336 --> 30:13.805
There's got to be
one up there.

30:28.054 --> 30:29.421
I got nothing.

30:31.223 --> 30:32.857
Yep.

30:32.859 --> 30:34.159
Mission accomplished.

30:34.793 --> 30:35.862
Good night.

30:46.738 --> 30:47.806
Who cares?

30:49.142 --> 30:50.740
We went on a couple of dates,
and honestly,

30:50.742 --> 30:53.209
all he did was talk about
fire, fire, fire,

30:53.211 --> 30:56.246
and smoke and jumping
and blah, blah, blah.

30:56.248 --> 30:58.517
I mean, whatever. I'm over it.

30:59.351 --> 31:00.684
Why do I, Jake Carson,

31:00.686 --> 31:02.887
deserve to be
Division Commander?

31:09.162 --> 31:12.163
<i>He's gross.
Unless you're into sort of a tall, like,</i>

31:12.165 --> 31:16.366
really fit, muscly,
like, sculptured face

31:16.368 --> 31:19.269
and clean-cut, kind of
somehow-always-has-a-tan,

31:19.271 --> 31:22.405
guy-in-uniform kind of thing,
which...

31:22.407 --> 31:24.607
I don't know, I'm not
into that kind of thing.

31:24.609 --> 31:26.378
I'm just not.
I never have been.

31:31.216 --> 31:32.718
Come on, Dad, what do you got?

31:39.892 --> 31:43.830
"Thankfully, that's an easy answer.

31:45.031 --> 31:46.396
"It was my dad's dream

31:46.398 --> 31:49.100
"for me to become
Division Commander,

31:49.102 --> 31:54.406
"and I have prepared for that
opportunity my entire life."

31:59.912 --> 32:01.379
Masher?

32:02.748 --> 32:07.686
The worst part
is that he hasn't even asked

32:08.320 --> 32:09.922
to meet you two yet.

32:11.356 --> 32:13.258
Give each other a kiss.

32:20.565 --> 32:21.633
Traitor.

32:56.735 --> 32:58.336
Uh-oh.

33:24.629 --> 33:25.965
Whoa!

33:46.384 --> 33:49.053
- I made you tea.
- Tea? How did you make...

33:49.055 --> 33:51.590
Lighter fluid!

33:53.692 --> 33:54.892
Again! Again!

33:58.931 --> 34:00.530
Mmm!

34:00.532 --> 34:03.968
Come on, are you kidding me?
That's so good.

34:08.139 --> 34:09.974
Hey, Supe.
You have got to try

34:09.976 --> 34:11.708
some of these pancakes
Brynn made for us.

34:11.710 --> 34:14.777
Or you could try my SPAM cakes
that nobody seems to want to touch.

34:14.779 --> 34:18.148
I don't care about the pancakes!
Why'd you let me sleep in?

34:18.150 --> 34:19.415
We thought you wanted
to sleep in.

34:19.417 --> 34:20.851
I never slept in
a day of my life!

34:20.853 --> 34:22.987
Well,
that's what we thought.

34:22.989 --> 34:25.889
But Brynn was...

34:25.891 --> 34:27.324
These aren't flapjacks.

34:27.326 --> 34:29.525
Those are distract-jacks.

34:29.527 --> 34:30.928
- Hold this.
- Whoa... Um...

34:30.929 --> 34:33.696
- Here. Hold this.
- No. No, I can't. I can't.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.632
- I have a condition. I...
- Thank you so much.

34:35.634 --> 34:39.105
I would like to, but if I see
somebody cry, I cry.

34:40.672 --> 34:41.908
Mark!

34:43.808 --> 34:45.574
Please don't cry.

34:45.577 --> 34:48.978
I beg of you,
please, please don't cry.

34:48.981 --> 34:50.480
Don't cry.

34:50.482 --> 34:51.714
Wait, wait. I know.

34:51.716 --> 34:54.550
How about a little, um...
SPAM brulee?

34:54.552 --> 34:57.722
How about a giant
spoonful of happiness?

34:58.423 --> 35:00.157
I can do this.

35:00.159 --> 35:01.760
How hard can this be?

35:08.067 --> 35:11.070
Whoa! Hard! Very hard!

35:12.537 --> 35:14.941
What is going on in here?

35:16.242 --> 35:18.409
I thought I said
no monkey...

35:21.414 --> 35:23.280
You got to let go!

35:23.282 --> 35:24.982
I can't get to the hose!

35:24.984 --> 35:26.549
She's so sad!

35:26.551 --> 35:28.785
- You gave her what?
- I gave her my SPAM brulee.

35:28.787 --> 35:31.121
- I'm going in!
- I'm right behind you!

35:33.725 --> 35:34.759
Bubbles!

35:35.727 --> 35:37.895
Where'd you go?

35:40.866 --> 35:42.765
Come back!

35:46.939 --> 35:48.740
Help! Help!

35:51.210 --> 35:52.544
Where's the kid?

35:56.415 --> 35:58.650
What a rush.

36:00.353 --> 36:01.686
My depot.

36:02.188 --> 36:04.121
Oh...

36:04.123 --> 36:06.190
- My truck!
- Ooh!

36:06.192 --> 36:09.726
Look, I'm gonna take
full responsibility for this.

36:09.728 --> 36:11.328
Own up to my mistakes.

36:11.330 --> 36:13.964
I feel like I've learned a lot
from this experience.

36:13.966 --> 36:16.967
- Where's your sister?
- Supe, she's on your leg.

36:16.969 --> 36:18.037
Bubbles!

36:18.570 --> 36:19.939
Not that one.

36:21.340 --> 36:22.973
Can I help you
find something?

36:22.975 --> 36:24.475
Uh...

36:24.477 --> 36:27.011
I was just, uh...
Looking for a pen.

36:27.013 --> 36:30.016
It's been a while since I've
written in my journal. Got it.

36:32.084 --> 36:33.783
Did I miss something?

36:33.785 --> 36:36.420
Oh, yeah. The second I
reached the end of my rope.

36:42.761 --> 36:45.195
Great. Your parents
are on their way.

36:45.197 --> 36:47.931
Oh, good.

36:47.933 --> 36:50.535
I see you're applying
for a big promotion.

36:51.237 --> 36:52.836
- Yeah.
- Congrats.

36:52.838 --> 36:54.670
Seems like your dream job.

36:54.672 --> 36:56.240
Whatever it is,
the answer's no.

36:56.242 --> 36:57.508
Boom-boom.

36:57.510 --> 36:58.976
"Boom-boom"?
What's boom-boom?

37:07.386 --> 37:09.752
No more boom-boom.

37:09.754 --> 37:11.823
Looks like your sister
needs an oil change.

37:14.927 --> 37:16.095
Great.

37:16.462 --> 37:17.796
Lieutenant!

37:19.198 --> 37:22.199
- Lieutenant!
- He's not here. What's going on?

37:22.201 --> 37:23.568
Oh!

37:25.703 --> 37:28.338
Ho! That's a spicy meatball!

37:37.016 --> 37:37.981
Captain.

37:37.983 --> 37:40.017
- Perfect timing as always.
- Oh!

37:40.019 --> 37:41.818
- Come with me.
- Oh, I'd rather...

37:41.820 --> 37:43.921
If it's all right with you,
I'd rather not.

37:46.791 --> 37:48.961
Yeah, yeah,
that's not good.

37:49.594 --> 37:50.930
Okay, here.

37:53.866 --> 37:55.731
You think I'm gonna
let this rattle me?

37:55.733 --> 37:58.035
I put out an entire canyon
fire with my bare hands.

37:58.037 --> 37:58.936
That's right.

37:58.938 --> 38:00.838
Nobody handles poop
better than Supe.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.640
That sounded a lot better
in my head.

38:05.710 --> 38:08.680
Oh, Rodrigo's SPAM brulee!

38:10.382 --> 38:12.251
That is...

38:21.560 --> 38:23.095
Don't look at me.

38:25.564 --> 38:27.231
Don't do it, or I'm gonna...

38:30.735 --> 38:32.603
I'm good.

38:32.605 --> 38:34.071
It's not funny.

38:34.073 --> 38:36.874
- Hold down the fort.
- Wait! No, no...

38:36.876 --> 38:38.609
No, put that...
Put that down.

38:38.611 --> 38:41.078
You don't need that.
You don't need that.

38:41.080 --> 38:43.547
Oh! Okay,
baby with a nail gun!

38:52.458 --> 38:54.059
Nails hurt.

39:01.300 --> 39:03.169
Oh. Oh!

39:07.339 --> 39:09.606
- I'm going in.
- Oh, it's all yours, Supe.

39:09.608 --> 39:11.175
I know you were asking
for a little space lately,

39:11.177 --> 39:13.577
and I think now's the time
I gave it to you.

39:13.579 --> 39:15.579
Sweet misery.

39:15.581 --> 39:17.747
How is that smell getting
through an SCBA?

39:17.749 --> 39:20.052
This thing's designed
to keep out nuclear particles!

39:22.221 --> 39:23.954
I need a towel.

39:23.956 --> 39:25.856
Masher, bring me that shirt.

39:25.858 --> 39:28.127
No, no, no. Whoa, whoa.
That's my favorite shirt.

39:29.028 --> 39:30.494
Supe, please.

39:30.496 --> 39:31.830
No gloves?

39:36.001 --> 39:38.535
Oh!

39:38.537 --> 39:40.339
Right up the armhole!

39:41.540 --> 39:43.775
You know what?
Keep the shirt.

39:47.213 --> 39:50.282
- Captain!
- You need more soap. Got it.

39:53.919 --> 39:57.888
Wow. Jake sure has you
at his beck and call.

39:57.890 --> 40:01.358
Well, it is my job,
and he is my boss, so...

40:01.360 --> 40:05.095
Yeah, but do you ever want
to do anything just for you?

40:05.097 --> 40:08.899
Okay, uh,
let me explain something.

40:08.901 --> 40:12.336
Six years ago, I was
working as an accountant,

40:12.338 --> 40:14.438
and I had to meet up with
a client in Big Bear Lake.

40:14.440 --> 40:17.807
And we got trapped on the wrong
side of a Category G wildfire.

40:17.809 --> 40:19.509
I thought I was a goner.

40:19.511 --> 40:23.447
And then, out of nowhere,
comes Supe, a smokejumper.

40:23.449 --> 40:26.316
I didn't even know
that was a job you could have.

40:26.318 --> 40:27.884
I was an accountant.

40:27.886 --> 40:31.655
My dad was an accountant,
his father,

40:31.657 --> 40:33.991
my uncle...
Oh, my gosh, my aunt...

40:33.993 --> 40:37.027
I think I have
three second cousins...

40:37.029 --> 40:39.696
You get the point.
And they're all heroes.

40:39.698 --> 40:41.465
To me. In their own way.

40:41.467 --> 40:44.668
But that day, I realized that my calling
was not with the family business,

40:44.670 --> 40:46.005
and I started training.

40:46.905 --> 40:49.306
- What about you?
- What?

40:49.308 --> 40:52.609
Do you have anything you love?
That you do just for yourself.

40:52.611 --> 40:54.311
Oh.

40:54.313 --> 40:57.049
Art. I used to paint.

40:57.650 --> 40:59.316
That's really cool.

40:59.318 --> 41:01.385
You definitely should
get back into that.

41:01.387 --> 41:05.924
And then, maybe you will find someone
to inspire you the way Supe did me.

41:06.425 --> 41:07.691
I hope not.

41:09.228 --> 41:12.795
Look, I know you don't
see it, but...

41:12.797 --> 41:15.899
Supe, he has a sweet side.

41:15.901 --> 41:17.734
Captain,
get in here, stat!

41:17.736 --> 41:21.907
Or I swear you'll be on latrine
duty for the next six months!

41:28.714 --> 41:30.115
Good talk.

41:32.985 --> 41:35.919
All right, little man,
this is your mess,

41:35.921 --> 41:39.089
- but I ain't mad at you, okay?
- Okay.

41:39.091 --> 41:41.958
As long as we leave this
spotless, all right? The Five P's.

41:41.960 --> 41:44.761
"Proper Presentation
Prevents Poor Performance."

41:44.763 --> 41:46.163
Okay.

41:46.165 --> 41:48.065
Let's clean this up real good,
now. Come on.

41:48.067 --> 41:51.601
Whoa! That's awesome.

41:51.603 --> 41:53.804
What's in there?

41:53.806 --> 41:55.607
That's our
fire training simulator.

41:59.678 --> 42:01.013
Tea?

42:04.483 --> 42:07.150
Whoa.

42:07.152 --> 42:09.121
So what do you think
of the fire simulator?

42:09.755 --> 42:11.090
That's so cool.

42:11.423 --> 42:12.591
Tea for you.

42:13.359 --> 42:14.426
Tea for you.

42:18.630 --> 42:20.032
Cheers.

42:21.133 --> 42:23.135
Brynn, you want some tea?

42:24.770 --> 42:26.136
Sure, Z.

42:26.138 --> 42:28.171
Right now I need
to show you something, okay?

42:28.173 --> 42:30.075
We'll be right back, Mr. Axe.

42:34.813 --> 42:36.248
Finally.

42:38.117 --> 42:40.150
All right, let's get
to work.

42:44.456 --> 42:46.258
Smoke?

42:49.728 --> 42:51.628
What are you doing?

42:51.630 --> 42:54.032
Don't drink that. Trust me.

43:12.284 --> 43:14.151
Confirmed Class D forest fire.

43:14.153 --> 43:16.653
Reporting structures
in its path.

43:16.655 --> 43:18.021
Requesting a fire line

43:18.023 --> 43:19.523
and suppression foam
at my location.

43:19.525 --> 43:22.993
Copy that, little captain.
Requesting a fire line...

43:22.995 --> 43:25.429
Wait a minute.
Come on, how did you know that?

43:25.431 --> 43:27.330
My dad and I used to
watch fire shows together.

43:27.332 --> 43:29.065
- Oh, yeah?
- Okay, we've got two victims

43:29.067 --> 43:30.200
just half a klick away.

43:30.202 --> 43:32.569
Okay, two victims
at half a klick.

43:32.571 --> 43:34.604
We got two victims
at half a...

43:34.606 --> 43:38.642
Two victims? That's...
That's a lot of victims here.

43:38.644 --> 43:41.213
Half a klick is pretty far,
I don't know...

43:41.747 --> 43:43.213
I don't know. I...

43:43.215 --> 43:45.615
I got to call for backup.
I need backup!

43:45.617 --> 43:47.284
No. No time for backup,
Torres.

43:47.286 --> 43:49.052
It's up to us to rescue
those people.

43:49.054 --> 43:50.253
Kid, we got to bail.
We got to get out of here.

43:50.255 --> 43:51.623
We gotta go, I can't do this.

43:52.191 --> 43:53.123
Oh!

43:53.125 --> 43:54.591
Now, buck up, Lieutenant.

43:54.593 --> 43:57.929
I know you've never believed
in yourself, but I do!

43:57.931 --> 43:59.931
And your team
believes in you.

43:59.933 --> 44:03.235
And now I need you
to believe in yourself!

44:03.802 --> 44:05.368
You got this.

44:05.370 --> 44:08.873
Yeah. Yeah,
I got this. I got this.

44:08.875 --> 44:11.041
As Lance Armstrong once said,

44:11.043 --> 44:13.109
"That's one small step
for man,

44:13.111 --> 44:15.412
"but you better watch out
for the next one."

44:15.414 --> 44:19.017
It's Neil Armstrong.
And that's not what he said.

44:20.786 --> 44:22.619
I'm gonna save those people,

44:22.621 --> 44:28.627
or my name ain't Rodrigo Alejandro
Garcia Rosenstein Torres.

44:30.262 --> 44:32.195
Oh, hi, Supe.

44:32.197 --> 44:35.833
I was just showing Will here
how to use the, um...

44:35.835 --> 44:37.669
Yo, yo, where'd he go?

44:40.806 --> 44:42.241
You got to be kidding me.

44:44.911 --> 44:46.645
Hey! What are you doing?

44:47.412 --> 44:48.545
She tricked us!

44:48.547 --> 44:50.714
Whoa!

44:50.716 --> 44:51.916
She took my keys!

44:51.918 --> 44:53.683
What are you doing?

44:53.685 --> 44:56.655
Yo! She oiled the driveway!

44:57.422 --> 44:59.324
Whoa!

45:05.965 --> 45:08.198
Whoa!

45:08.200 --> 45:10.600
- Hold on.
- There's oil everywhere!

45:14.172 --> 45:16.306
Oh, nice split, Supe.

45:16.308 --> 45:18.475
It's too slippery!

45:18.477 --> 45:20.078
If you go, I go.

45:28.654 --> 45:31.523
Supe! You need a helmet!

45:59.852 --> 46:02.185
Supe? Did we kill you?

46:02.187 --> 46:03.722
Are you dead, Supe?

46:28.848 --> 46:30.948
Guess I forgot
the parking brake.

46:30.950 --> 46:32.950
What are you doing?

46:32.952 --> 46:34.551
Why would you run away?

46:34.553 --> 46:36.586
Your parents are gonna be
at the depot any minute.

46:36.588 --> 46:39.689
I was worried they'd freak out
on me. They left me in charge,

46:39.691 --> 46:42.125
and the cabin burned down.
I panicked.

46:42.127 --> 46:43.828
You did it this time, okay?

46:43.830 --> 46:47.098
My men can't even take the
chopper to come look for us

46:47.100 --> 46:48.465
because they need
proper authorization,

46:48.467 --> 46:50.669
and I'm the proper
authorizer. We...

46:51.938 --> 46:54.804
At least a five-mile walk.
Uphill!

46:54.806 --> 46:57.440
Guess your parents are gonna have
to wait for their family reunion.

46:57.442 --> 46:58.808
Mama.

46:58.810 --> 47:00.145
Just tell him, Brynn.

47:02.147 --> 47:03.613
Look...

47:03.615 --> 47:06.984
Our parents are in Africa,
getting an experimental procedure.

47:06.986 --> 47:08.585
Brynn.

47:08.587 --> 47:09.486
Okay...

47:09.488 --> 47:12.756
You can't tell anybody this,

47:12.758 --> 47:16.127
but our parents work for a
secret government organization.

47:16.129 --> 47:17.529
Brynn!

47:19.765 --> 47:20.933
Spit it out!

47:21.834 --> 47:22.935
Our parents,

47:24.003 --> 47:25.437
they're not coming.

47:26.638 --> 47:27.706
Why?

47:28.507 --> 47:30.342
They died,

47:31.044 --> 47:32.377
two years ago.

47:34.312 --> 47:35.848
Who have I been texting with?

47:46.425 --> 47:48.861
I had no idea.
I'm sorry.

47:51.898 --> 47:53.398
Why didn't you tell me?

47:54.299 --> 47:57.734
Because we ran away
from foster care,

47:57.736 --> 48:00.637
and I knew you'd call
Child Protective Services.

48:00.639 --> 48:02.674
A month ago,
we found out that they're

48:03.142 --> 48:04.676
gonna separate us.

48:07.980 --> 48:10.181
Okay, look, it's...

48:10.183 --> 48:12.850
It's too dangerous
to hike at night,

48:12.852 --> 48:15.819
so I'm gonna go find a place
for us to hunker down, and...

48:15.821 --> 48:18.655
We'll get out of here
at first light, okay?

48:18.657 --> 48:21.660
And trust me, you guys
are in good hands.

48:41.513 --> 48:42.581
Gotcha.

48:43.448 --> 48:45.617
Who wants chipmunk?

48:47.719 --> 48:49.086
Nobody.

48:49.088 --> 48:50.620
Nobody in the whole world.

48:50.622 --> 48:53.023
Where'd, uh...
Where'd all this come from?

48:53.025 --> 48:55.059
My backpack.

48:55.061 --> 48:57.395
And a little
from your supply closet.

48:59.832 --> 49:01.033
Hot cocoa?

49:03.702 --> 49:04.837
Yes.

49:07.572 --> 49:09.341
Hey, Supe, where you going?

49:10.943 --> 49:12.811
Nature calls. Back in a few.

49:15.214 --> 49:16.412
Thanks.

49:20.086 --> 49:21.417
What is it?

49:21.419 --> 49:23.220
She's scared out here.
She doesn't want you to leave.

49:23.222 --> 49:25.657
There's no reason to be scared.
Bear sightings are pretty rare.

49:26.058 --> 49:27.158
Bears?

49:29.195 --> 49:31.061
Smooth.

49:31.063 --> 49:33.465
Trust me, Zoey, this is not
a trip you want to join me on.

49:41.506 --> 49:44.008
I can't go with you
looking at me.

49:44.010 --> 49:46.243
- Could you look away?
- No.

49:46.245 --> 49:48.014
Fine. I'll look away.

49:54.753 --> 49:55.920
Okay, stop.

49:55.922 --> 49:57.056
Boom-boom?

49:58.257 --> 50:00.423
Nope. Not happening.
No boom-boom.

50:00.425 --> 50:02.325
Bears!

50:08.333 --> 50:09.701
Stay behind me.

50:17.143 --> 50:18.641
Sparkle Pony!

50:18.643 --> 50:20.777
- Masher.
- Sparkle Pony!

50:27.320 --> 50:29.654
Good night,
Sparkle Pony.

50:33.692 --> 50:36.426
I got to say,
your camping skills,

50:36.428 --> 50:38.663
they're on point.

50:40.299 --> 50:42.565
That's what
the kids say, right?

50:42.567 --> 50:44.436
Something like that.

50:49.876 --> 50:52.544
You know, I lost my parents
at a young age, too.

50:54.746 --> 50:57.614
I was too young
to remember my mom.

50:57.616 --> 50:59.852
My dad died on the job
when I was a kid.

51:01.320 --> 51:02.787
Sorry.

51:04.323 --> 51:06.123
Brynn,

51:06.125 --> 51:08.192
you gotta stop running.

51:08.194 --> 51:11.461
You should be in school.
You should be making friends.

51:11.463 --> 51:13.531
Causing a different type
of trouble.

51:15.902 --> 51:17.500
Trust me,

51:17.502 --> 51:19.036
you don't want to
look back on all this

51:19.038 --> 51:21.539
and realize you never
had a chance to be a kid.

51:25.344 --> 51:27.479
Sorry for all
the monkey business.

51:28.848 --> 51:30.881
That's what the old guys
call it, right?

51:30.883 --> 51:32.283
Apparently, we do.

51:39.258 --> 51:42.725
I know you don't
owe us any favors,

51:42.727 --> 51:45.461
but it's Zoey's birthday
in two days.

51:45.463 --> 51:48.935
I'd hate for that to be the day
she remembers them splitting us up.

51:53.239 --> 51:54.874
I'll call CPS tomorrow,

51:55.674 --> 51:57.209
tell them to come Monday.

51:59.111 --> 52:00.478
Thanks.

52:05.084 --> 52:06.582
Good night.

52:06.584 --> 52:08.087
Good night, Brynn.

52:22.101 --> 52:23.635
No, no, I, uh...

52:24.803 --> 52:27.404
Yes, I completely understand.

52:27.406 --> 52:29.541
- What's he saying?
- I can't understand.

52:36.148 --> 52:38.115
Just got off the phone
with CPS.

52:38.117 --> 52:40.717
Looks like you're stuck here
until Monday!

52:40.719 --> 52:43.187
- What? Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes!
- Yeah!

52:43.189 --> 52:44.520
Yay!

52:44.522 --> 52:46.789
Now, I have
an application to fill out.

52:46.791 --> 52:49.559
And I'll need all hands on deck
to get this place shipshape

52:49.561 --> 52:51.627
before Commander Richards
arrives.

52:51.629 --> 52:54.200
- Where's my Redding Crew at?
- Everywhere!

53:09.482 --> 53:11.581
My <i>abuelita</i> used to make
the most delicious

53:11.583 --> 53:14.151
jalapeno chocolate cake
you ever had.

53:14.153 --> 53:15.518
It's the secret ingredient.

53:15.520 --> 53:16.786
Jalapeno chocolate?

53:16.788 --> 53:19.156
Sounds weird,
but when you taste it,

53:19.158 --> 53:20.860
it's so...

53:21.327 --> 53:23.027
It's so...

53:23.029 --> 53:25.896
I touched my mouth.
My mouth is on fire.

53:25.898 --> 53:28.798
My mouth, it's burning!

53:28.800 --> 53:32.537
My grandma always said,
never touch your face with...

53:35.607 --> 53:37.107
Now my eye's burning.

53:37.109 --> 53:39.845
My eye's burning
and my lips are on fire!

53:40.812 --> 53:42.913
It hurts! It hurts!
It hurts!

53:52.291 --> 53:53.723
Oh!

53:53.725 --> 53:55.828
Who wants SPAM-a-kopita?

53:56.328 --> 53:58.529
Nope.

53:58.531 --> 53:59.997
Come on,
I made it with extra gluten.

53:59.999 --> 54:01.999
It's got spinach in it
and everything.

54:03.969 --> 54:05.069
Hey, Supe. Supe.

54:05.071 --> 54:06.872
Is it supposed to
smoke like that?

54:07.806 --> 54:10.042
Maybe the coals
aren't hot enough, huh?

54:12.311 --> 54:13.377
Smells good!

54:13.379 --> 54:14.545
Dr. Hicks!

54:23.122 --> 54:25.923
"Teach a man to light a fire,
and he's warm for a day.

54:25.925 --> 54:28.624
"Light a man on fire,
he's warm for life."

54:28.626 --> 54:30.329
- Ben Franklin.
- Oh, come...

54:31.530 --> 54:34.164
I hope this isn't my fault.

54:34.166 --> 54:38.335
I was just dropping off some
puzzles for the kids, and...

54:38.337 --> 54:43.407
I was just very surprised to
see you doing something so fun.

54:43.409 --> 54:44.975
- Me?
- Yeah.

54:44.977 --> 54:46.910
- I'm Mr. Fun, okay?
- Oh.

54:46.912 --> 54:48.778
- Yeah.
- I feel like Mr. Fun

54:48.780 --> 54:51.814
would go by his first name
and not "Mister."

54:51.816 --> 54:53.751
But I don't know, you know.
I don't know.

54:54.320 --> 54:55.620
Yeah.

54:56.754 --> 54:58.355
I knew
you could handle it.

54:58.357 --> 55:01.691
I mean, kids are like fires.
You know, you can't...

55:01.693 --> 55:05.695
You can't control them,
you just have to...

55:05.697 --> 55:08.334
Contain them
till they burn themselves out.

55:10.035 --> 55:12.069
- That's actually right.
- I know.

55:12.071 --> 55:13.803
I didn't know
you knew anything about fire.

55:13.805 --> 55:16.607
Well, someone
I went on 2.5 dates with

55:16.609 --> 55:17.807
talks about them a lot.

55:17.809 --> 55:20.010
Maybe I listened
a little more than I let on.

55:20.012 --> 55:21.245
And here I thought
all you cared about

55:21.247 --> 55:23.380
was the Western Spadefoot
because their secretions

55:23.382 --> 55:25.715
smell like peanut butter
and can cause sneezing.

55:25.717 --> 55:27.783
Somebody I went
on 2.5 dates with

55:27.785 --> 55:29.853
talks a whole lot
about toads.

55:29.855 --> 55:32.024
And I listen a little bit
more than I let on.

55:33.758 --> 55:35.861
Maybe we don't
hate each other.

55:36.862 --> 55:38.364
There's no way
that can be true.

55:39.298 --> 55:40.564
- Mmm-mmm.
- Be quiet.

55:40.566 --> 55:42.332
You be quiet.

55:42.334 --> 55:44.069
Don't say "act
casual" when you're trying to act casual!

55:53.345 --> 55:54.545
- Well...
- Yeah.

55:54.547 --> 55:57.481
Why don't you kids shower up,
and I'll take another stab

55:57.483 --> 55:58.982
at getting that grill
going, safely.

55:58.984 --> 56:02.419
All right,
I'm gonna go, then,

56:02.421 --> 56:03.786
back to my trailer.

56:03.788 --> 56:07.024
My dinner's not gonna
microwave itself.

56:07.026 --> 56:09.962
I'm gonna go. All right, bye.

56:11.497 --> 56:13.933
So organized.

56:18.404 --> 56:19.704
Bye.

56:27.179 --> 56:28.247
What?

56:29.048 --> 56:30.847
You're just gonna let her go?

56:30.849 --> 56:32.649
What a whiff.

56:32.651 --> 56:34.985
"Whiff"?
How'd I whiff?

56:34.987 --> 56:37.087
Well, you were talking to
her, and then she left,

56:37.089 --> 56:38.821
and it was a bit
of a whiff.

56:38.823 --> 56:40.891
Open your eyes, dude!

56:40.893 --> 56:42.559
She's spending
the weekend alone.

56:42.561 --> 56:43.759
In an eco lab.

56:43.761 --> 56:45.996
No kids. No crying.

56:45.998 --> 56:47.331
It sounds like
a dream come true.

56:47.333 --> 56:49.833
J-Dawg, come on, man.
That's mad absurd.

56:49.835 --> 56:52.035
People like being
around people!

56:52.037 --> 56:56.139
"People who need people are the
luckiest people in the world."

56:56.141 --> 56:57.474
Barbara Bush.

56:57.476 --> 56:58.774
So close.

56:58.776 --> 57:00.410
You should invite her back.

57:00.412 --> 57:01.811
Huh? What, here?

57:01.813 --> 57:06.784
No, "in the Kingdom of Equestria,
where everything is 20% cooler."

57:07.319 --> 57:08.420
Rainbow Dash.

57:09.888 --> 57:11.255
That might be right.

57:11.257 --> 57:12.556
No. Nope.

57:12.558 --> 57:14.757
I told you, attachments,
distractions in this line of work?

57:14.759 --> 57:15.993
No, it doesn't go good.

57:15.995 --> 57:19.098
Jake, you need to practice
letting your guard down.

57:21.634 --> 57:23.834
I'm not good
with any of that stuff.

57:23.836 --> 57:25.871
Well, this is
my area of expertise.

57:37.750 --> 57:41.287
I don't know, Superintendent.

57:42.388 --> 57:46.525
What's up with you?

57:47.960 --> 57:49.326
That was quick.

57:49.328 --> 57:51.662
Okay, now we're gonna reply
with something clever.

57:51.664 --> 57:53.297
I can take it from here.

57:57.336 --> 58:00.203
- What do I say?
- It's easy. You just say,

58:00.205 --> 58:05.144
"Hey, baby. You, me,
dinner. No presh."

58:05.744 --> 58:06.809
"No presh"?

58:06.811 --> 58:08.512
Yeah, no presh. He's right.

58:08.514 --> 58:11.248
'Cause it's flirtatious,
and yet not threatening, you know?

58:11.250 --> 58:14.353
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'm just gonna keep it simple.

58:15.387 --> 58:16.253
Dear Dr. Hicks,

58:16.255 --> 58:18.088
I am sending you
this text alert...

58:18.090 --> 58:21.158
- "Alert"? Text alert?
- ...to see if you are available

58:21.160 --> 58:23.060
- to convene for a...
- Jake.

58:23.062 --> 58:25.962
It sounds like you're filling
out your dull application.

58:25.964 --> 58:28.932
You don't say what you're
feeling. You show it.

58:32.338 --> 58:33.439
"No presh"?

58:36.175 --> 58:37.376
Poop.

58:39.611 --> 58:41.345
Poop, poop, poop.

58:43.415 --> 58:44.348
Zoey, no.

58:44.350 --> 58:47.384
Wait. What is this?
What are these...

58:47.386 --> 58:49.553
Chocolate-dessert-looking
things... Ice cream, right?

58:49.555 --> 58:53.357
Yeah, that's what it is!
It's chocolate ice cream!

58:53.359 --> 58:55.359
Great. Who doesn't love
ice cream, right?

58:55.361 --> 58:57.527
Uh, yeah, don't do that.
That's wrong, little man.

58:57.529 --> 58:58.929
- No, no...
- Don't lie to him.

59:00.032 --> 59:02.132
I think you're good
on the ice cream.

59:02.134 --> 59:04.002
- Supe, did you just send that?
- Yeah.

59:05.371 --> 59:07.072
Mmm...

59:07.606 --> 59:09.306
"Dot, dot, dot."

59:09.308 --> 59:11.908
- What is dot, dot, dot?
- That means she's answering.

59:11.910 --> 59:13.278
In Morse Code?

59:14.747 --> 59:16.246
The dots are gone.

59:16.248 --> 59:18.749
She hung up. Disappeared.
That means she changed her mind.

59:18.751 --> 59:20.050
Supe, relax.

59:20.052 --> 59:22.119
All right, all right.
Bit anxious, okay?

59:22.121 --> 59:25.088
I got a full audience watching
me go down in flames here.

59:25.090 --> 59:26.656
Not good.
Not good for morale,

59:26.658 --> 59:28.091
- not good for me.
- Okay.

59:28.093 --> 59:30.427
She's taking her time 'cause
she wants to get it right.

59:30.429 --> 59:32.095
- Breathe.
- Right.

59:36.435 --> 59:37.501
Smiley-face icon?

59:37.503 --> 59:39.069
No, uh, "emoji."

59:39.071 --> 59:40.804
- Frog icon?
- Emoji.

59:40.806 --> 59:43.308
Wine-bottle emoji?

59:45.711 --> 59:47.043
What does that mean?

59:47.045 --> 59:49.146
Means you got yourself
a date, stud.

59:49.148 --> 59:51.214
Yay, Jake, you got a date.

59:51.216 --> 59:53.885
Yeah, Supe!

59:53.887 --> 59:55.154
Whoo-hoo!

59:58.023 --> 01:00:00.690
General Tso's chicken
isn't made by a general.

01:00:00.692 --> 01:00:03.059
<i>Coq au vin</i> is not a vehicle.

01:00:03.061 --> 01:00:06.163
But it's...
It's not chocolate covered?

01:00:06.165 --> 01:00:09.232
- Wag!
- Look at you! Whoo-hoo!

01:00:09.234 --> 01:00:10.235
Surprise!

01:00:12.237 --> 01:00:15.407
We cleaned it up for you.
To thank you for saving us.

01:00:16.375 --> 01:00:18.076
That's just where
he had it, too.

01:00:18.677 --> 01:00:19.678
It's beautiful.

01:00:21.013 --> 01:00:22.813
- Thank you.
- Knock, knock!

01:00:22.815 --> 01:00:24.214
- Oh.
- Hey!

01:00:24.216 --> 01:00:26.583
- What a pleasant surprise.
- So good to see you. Welcome.

01:00:26.585 --> 01:00:28.985
- Thank you for having me.
- Yes, absolutely.

01:00:28.987 --> 01:00:31.123
- I brought cookies!
- Yay, cookies!

01:00:32.124 --> 01:00:34.159
Maybe just one before dinner.

01:00:35.127 --> 01:00:36.393
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:00:36.395 --> 01:00:38.628
- Can I partake?
- Sure.

01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:41.998
Ooh! Oh! Toad cookies.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.134
These look
toad-ally delicious.

01:00:44.136 --> 01:00:46.236
Do I detect a hint
of nutmeggery?

01:00:46.238 --> 01:00:48.338
- No.
- No? Really?

01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:49.406
Cimmanom?

01:00:49.408 --> 01:00:51.007
- Hmm?
- Huh?

01:00:51.009 --> 01:00:53.210
- Comin' in hot.
- Hi!

01:00:53.212 --> 01:00:55.212
Oh, wait. I have this all...

01:00:55.214 --> 01:00:57.747
- There you go.
- Oh, presentation.

01:00:58.984 --> 01:01:00.383
- May I take your coat?
- Yes.

01:01:00.385 --> 01:01:02.118
What a gentleman!

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.020
- Thank you.
- No.

01:01:04.022 --> 01:01:05.555
- Shall I put these in water?
- Oh.

01:01:05.557 --> 01:01:06.423
- Yes.
- Good idea.

01:01:06.425 --> 01:01:08.058
- Thank you.
- Make yourself useful.

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:09.827
- Right?
- Rodrigo!

01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:12.095
Oh. I got to go.

01:01:12.097 --> 01:01:13.732
I think it's going well.

01:01:15.133 --> 01:01:18.270
- Thanks for coming, Dr. Hicks.
- You can call me Amy.

01:01:18.804 --> 01:01:20.003
You can call me Supe.

01:01:22.007 --> 01:01:23.707
- Or Jake.
- Yeah.

01:01:23.709 --> 01:01:25.609
- Jake's more casual.
- "Jake."

01:01:25.611 --> 01:01:27.777
I'm gonna go put these
on a dessert platter.

01:01:27.779 --> 01:01:28.846
Okay.

01:01:28.848 --> 01:01:30.948
Don't think we have
a dessert platter.

01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:32.150
Okay.

01:01:33.953 --> 01:01:36.152
Truth is, I'm really glad
he invited me.

01:01:36.154 --> 01:01:37.955
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:01:37.957 --> 01:01:41.691
I mean, it's not just because I'm the
only woman in a 100-mile radius, right?

01:01:41.693 --> 01:01:44.229
No. I think
he really likes you.

01:01:46.164 --> 01:01:48.565
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome, sir.

01:01:48.567 --> 01:01:50.133
Thank you!

01:01:50.135 --> 01:01:52.269
You're welcome.
Bon appetit.

01:01:52.271 --> 01:01:55.274
- Okay.
- Let's go.

01:01:56.675 --> 01:01:58.742
Thanks, guys.

01:01:58.744 --> 01:02:01.079
- This is pretty amazing.
- What an exciting meal.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.948
Wow. I love a barbecue.

01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:05.215
Look at them.

01:02:05.217 --> 01:02:07.450
Oh, I sure hope they have
a beautiful romance

01:02:07.452 --> 01:02:10.855
and live happily ever after
like Romeo and Juliet.

01:02:10.857 --> 01:02:12.157
This is fun.

01:02:19.966 --> 01:02:22.198
Friendship is magic.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.367
These cookies are now
open for business.

01:02:24.369 --> 01:02:25.802
- Oh, hello!
- Yum, yum.

01:02:25.804 --> 01:02:26.938
Yummy,
yummy to my tummy.

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:29.239
Hey, Supe, why don't you
play us a song?

01:02:29.241 --> 01:02:31.274
- You play the piano?
- Not really.

01:02:31.276 --> 01:02:34.411
Plus, I know for a fact that
thing hasn't been tuned in years.

01:02:36.615 --> 01:02:37.848
We're all set, Supe.

01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:40.317
Thank you, Captain.

01:02:43.022 --> 01:02:44.356
Come on, Axe.

01:02:46.926 --> 01:02:48.393
Let's go.

01:02:50.429 --> 01:02:51.528
Play!

01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:53.530
Okay, I'm a little rusty,
so we got to keep it simple,

01:02:53.532 --> 01:02:55.165
but the request lines
are open!

01:02:55.167 --> 01:02:56.700
- Ariana Grande.
- BTS.

01:02:56.702 --> 01:02:58.802
Chance the Rapper. Drake.

01:02:58.804 --> 01:03:01.338
Post Malone. Kendrick Lamar.

01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:03.640
Wu-Tang Clan. Lil Pump.

01:03:03.642 --> 01:03:05.208
Okay, I'll be doing
the choosing.

01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:06.543
But I hope
your shoes are tied,

01:03:06.545 --> 01:03:08.511
'cause your socks
are about to get rocked off!

01:03:10.482 --> 01:03:14.186
<i>♪ I fell into
a burnin' ring of fire ♪</i>

01:03:16.688 --> 01:03:17.654
- Johnny Cash?
- Yeah.

01:03:17.656 --> 01:03:19.458
- <i>Ring of Fire?</i>
- I know what it is.

01:03:20.392 --> 01:03:22.392
Okay, not the vibe
of the room. That's fine.

01:03:22.394 --> 01:03:24.794
I'm about to take it
from zero to a hundred.

01:03:24.796 --> 01:03:26.630
<i>♪ The heat is on</i>

01:03:28.034 --> 01:03:29.801
<i>♪ On the street</i>

01:03:31.169 --> 01:03:33.372
<i>♪ Inside your head</i>

01:03:34.206 --> 01:03:36.208
<i>♪ And every beat</i>

01:03:37.442 --> 01:03:39.175
<i>♪ The heat is on! ♪</i>

01:03:41.213 --> 01:03:43.647
Glenn Frey!
<i>Heat Is On!</i> Nobody?

01:03:43.649 --> 01:03:45.615
Really got your finger
on the pulse.

01:03:47.086 --> 01:03:50.222
Don't tell me you only know how to
play songs that are fire-related.

01:03:50.822 --> 01:03:52.324
No.

01:03:54.626 --> 01:03:55.727
Yes.

01:03:56.762 --> 01:03:58.795
I grew up in a fire depot.

01:03:58.797 --> 01:04:00.365
Uh...

01:04:01.166 --> 01:04:02.799
Okay, it's late.

01:04:02.801 --> 01:04:04.267
You got to go to bed.
You don't want to be tired

01:04:04.269 --> 01:04:05.936
- for your birthday, right?
- Yeah! Yeah.

01:04:05.938 --> 01:04:08.039
Let's get you to bed.
Let's go.

01:04:08.041 --> 01:04:09.140
Here's some water.

01:04:09.142 --> 01:04:10.740
Good night.

01:04:10.742 --> 01:04:13.178
- See you in the morning.
- Um, Supe?

01:04:14.479 --> 01:04:16.212
No more songs,
I'm all tapped out.

01:04:16.214 --> 01:04:17.850
Then how about a story?

01:04:20.519 --> 01:04:22.686
- Zoey's already asleep.
- Fine.

01:04:22.688 --> 01:04:24.222
I want a story.

01:04:26.893 --> 01:04:28.291
I don't know any.

01:04:28.293 --> 01:04:30.529
That's okay, you can
make one up.

01:04:32.131 --> 01:04:35.198
That's not really how I'm wired, bud.
I just... I don't have...

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.700
An imagination?

01:04:36.702 --> 01:04:38.568
Are you kidding me?

01:04:38.570 --> 01:04:41.571
You are the most
creative guy I know.

01:04:41.573 --> 01:04:44.141
We would've never contained
the West Fork Valley fire

01:04:44.143 --> 01:04:47.210
if you hadn't thought
to trigger an avalanche.

01:04:47.212 --> 01:04:49.379
- Show us what you got.
- Yeah, come on, come on.

01:04:49.381 --> 01:04:51.349
Show us, Supe, come on.

01:04:51.851 --> 01:04:54.018
Okay. Okay.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.387
All right...

01:04:59.058 --> 01:05:02.594
Once upon a time, uh,
there was

01:05:03.495 --> 01:05:04.629
a Yeti.

01:05:05.664 --> 01:05:07.530
A brave Yeti.

01:05:07.532 --> 01:05:10.533
He protected
all the other Yetis,

01:05:10.535 --> 01:05:14.539
and he had the most shipshape
cave on Yeti Mountain.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:18.708
And one day the Yeti
had a kid named Jake.

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:21.212
And the Yeti had to take care
of the kid all by himself.

01:05:21.214 --> 01:05:25.515
Now, the Yeti did the best he
could to make that cave a home,

01:05:25.517 --> 01:05:27.419
but sometimes it was
hard for the Yeti.

01:05:28.221 --> 01:05:30.589
But the kid loved it.

01:05:34.093 --> 01:05:36.793
One day, there was
a fire on the mountain.

01:05:36.795 --> 01:05:39.999
And the Yeti went
to go fight the fire.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.035
And he got distracted.

01:05:44.436 --> 01:05:47.370
Never made it back.

01:05:47.372 --> 01:05:52.109
Maybe the Yeti was thinking of the
kid when he took his eye off the ball.

01:05:52.111 --> 01:05:56.446
The kid felt so guilty that he swore
he'd never let anything get in the way

01:05:56.448 --> 01:06:00.350
of achieving everything
the Yeti sacrificed for him.

01:06:00.352 --> 01:06:05.222
To this day, every time that kid sees
fire he can hear the Yeti's voice.

01:06:05.224 --> 01:06:09.061
When you saved us from that
fire, could you hear the Yeti?

01:06:13.966 --> 01:06:15.667
You know what, I could.

01:06:18.537 --> 01:06:20.703
Now get to sleep,
or I'm gonna give Axe direct orders

01:06:20.705 --> 01:06:22.875
to eat that cake
all by himself.

01:06:27.246 --> 01:06:29.015
- Um, Supe?
- Yeah.

01:06:29.949 --> 01:06:31.182
Thanks.

01:06:31.184 --> 01:06:33.752
I haven't seen Brynn
this happy in...

01:06:34.586 --> 01:06:37.556
Well, it's like
she's the old Brynn.

01:06:42.694 --> 01:06:44.962
- Hey, Jake?
- Yeah?

01:06:44.964 --> 01:06:49.101
I forgot. I found these outside
the depot on the ground.

01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:51.838
Figured you might
want 'em back.

01:06:57.043 --> 01:07:00.277
Yeah. Thanks, Brynn.

01:07:00.279 --> 01:07:03.348
Also, you should
ask Amy to stay the night.

01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:05.415
That's inappropriate.

01:07:05.417 --> 01:07:06.649
Calm down, Romeo.

01:07:06.651 --> 01:07:09.452
There's like seven
extra bunks in here.

01:07:09.454 --> 01:07:12.890
And you can't just let her drive
home in the middle of the night.

01:07:12.892 --> 01:07:15.326
Besides, it's Zoey's
birthday tomorrow.

01:07:15.328 --> 01:07:17.529
We want her to be here.

01:07:18.763 --> 01:07:20.331
Ah...

01:07:20.333 --> 01:07:23.401
Hey, Jake? Guard down.

01:07:31.143 --> 01:07:32.477
Is that your dad?

01:07:33.312 --> 01:07:35.045
Yeah. That's him.

01:07:35.047 --> 01:07:39.618
Carving the depot turkey at Thanksgiving
and decorating the depot tree.

01:07:48.094 --> 01:07:52.363
You're really lucky to have
so many memories in one place.

01:07:52.365 --> 01:07:54.832
When I was a kid,
we moved around a lot,

01:07:54.834 --> 01:07:59.837
so I would have to find
whatever lake or pond or stream

01:07:59.839 --> 01:08:02.942
was closest, and make
all those critters my friends.

01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:06.012
Pretty lucky critters,
I'd say.

01:08:08.047 --> 01:08:10.515
Whatever.

01:08:13.185 --> 01:08:15.219
- Hey, Supe?
- What?

01:08:15.221 --> 01:08:16.752
I mean,
what do they want now?

01:08:16.755 --> 01:08:19.122
It's just that those kids,
those <i>ninos,</i>

01:08:19.125 --> 01:08:21.258
they're so amazing, you know?

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.859
Yeah, they are pretty cute.

01:08:22.862 --> 01:08:25.761
We'll probably never see them
again after Zoey's birthday.

01:08:25.764 --> 01:08:28.531
And we didn't even
get any presents for her.

01:08:28.533 --> 01:08:30.500
- Not even a card.
- Well, what do we do?

01:08:30.502 --> 01:08:31.902
The roads have dried up
and the stores

01:08:31.904 --> 01:08:34.104
at the bottom of the mountain
are open for another hour.

01:08:34.106 --> 01:08:36.173
I could copter us there
if you needed me to.

01:08:36.175 --> 01:08:37.607
- Not gonna happen.
- No, that's okay. No, no, no.

01:08:37.609 --> 01:08:40.144
We can make it,
if we go full out.

01:08:40.145 --> 01:08:42.812
Listen,
the kids wanted you to spend the night

01:08:42.814 --> 01:08:45.082
to go to their birthday party
tomorrow anyway.

01:08:45.084 --> 01:08:46.816
Would you mind watching them
for a little bit?

01:08:46.818 --> 01:08:48.285
And not because
you're a woman.

01:08:48.287 --> 01:08:49.987
Okay.

01:08:49.988 --> 01:08:52.323
Thank you. Now...

01:08:52.325 --> 01:08:55.059
- Where's my Redding Crew at?
- Everywhere!

01:09:13.845 --> 01:09:14.912
You know what?

01:09:14.913 --> 01:09:16.447
Let's get Brynn
and Will some stuff, too.

01:09:16.448 --> 01:09:18.349
If we're gonna make it a party,
we should make it a good one.

01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:20.250
We'll cover more ground
if we spread out.

01:09:20.252 --> 01:09:21.752
- Move out!
- Yes, sir!

01:09:33.198 --> 01:09:34.265
Hmm...

01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:49.246
Whew. Ooh, ooh, ooh!

01:09:49.247 --> 01:09:50.712
A drone.

01:09:50.715 --> 01:09:52.648
Do you know if this is a good
toy for a three-year-old girl?

01:09:52.649 --> 01:09:54.550
Are you sure she doesn't
want a drone?

01:09:54.552 --> 01:09:56.652
Is there any world at all

01:09:56.654 --> 01:09:59.423
where a three-year-old girl
would want a drone?

01:09:59.425 --> 01:10:00.826
Okay. All right.

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.296
Oh, gosh, yes, the bike!

01:10:12.704 --> 01:10:14.572
- Excuse me, I need that.
- Hey!

01:10:49.275 --> 01:10:50.541
Equestria!

01:10:50.543 --> 01:10:51.942
Oh, you know it, girl.

01:10:51.944 --> 01:10:54.178
There she is,
the birthday girl.

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:56.781
Happy birthday, Zoey.

01:11:00.052 --> 01:11:02.354
- She's quick.
- Are you bigger today?

01:11:09.661 --> 01:11:11.864
This is
beautiful, Brynn!

01:11:14.433 --> 01:11:15.800
Wow.

01:11:24.844 --> 01:11:26.611
<i>I love you.</i>

01:11:28.514 --> 01:11:30.182
Yay.

01:11:31.283 --> 01:11:32.815
Cheers.

01:11:32.817 --> 01:11:34.384
Look at
all these presents!

01:11:34.386 --> 01:11:37.321
You know, maybe one or two in there
are for you and Brynn as well.

01:11:37.323 --> 01:11:38.989
Really?
Why?

01:11:38.991 --> 01:11:43.494
Well, we didn't know if we were gonna be
invited to your birthdays, so we figured,

01:11:43.496 --> 01:11:45.364
let's celebrate now. Go!

01:11:46.532 --> 01:11:47.799
Wow.

01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:52.872
I love it.

01:11:54.607 --> 01:11:56.842
Will,
open this one next.

01:12:03.082 --> 01:12:04.448
Welcome to the team.

01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:06.383
- Thank you!
- Oh!

01:12:06.385 --> 01:12:10.389
Hey, you ever need us,
this will help us find you.

01:12:12.892 --> 01:12:15.058
- Is this a laser?
- It is.

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.062
Thank you,
that's so cool!

01:12:26.138 --> 01:12:27.705
Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:12:28.641 --> 01:12:30.910
No, don't...
Don't do that.

01:12:31.844 --> 01:12:33.179
No, don't do that.

01:12:35.314 --> 01:12:36.746
I got you something, too.

01:12:36.748 --> 01:12:38.482
I didn't want you
to feel left out.

01:12:38.484 --> 01:12:40.150
Ta-da!

01:12:40.152 --> 01:12:41.451
- Whoa!
- Ow!

01:12:41.453 --> 01:12:42.718
Ow!

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:45.157
- I didn't even...
- I'm just kidding.

01:12:49.061 --> 01:12:52.231
It smells a little like carbon
dioxide, but it's legit.

01:12:53.465 --> 01:12:54.730
This means a lot to me.

01:12:54.732 --> 01:12:57.034
Well, I did it
for the Western Spadefoot.

01:12:57.036 --> 01:12:58.602
I'll be sure
to let them know.

01:12:58.604 --> 01:13:00.537
Hey, Supe,
we got this for you.

01:13:00.539 --> 01:13:02.074
Um, it's from everyone.

01:13:05.177 --> 01:13:07.878
It's a...
It's a T-shirt.

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.914
That's Princess Celestia,
the leader of the ponies.

01:13:10.916 --> 01:13:12.516
Come on. Try it on.

01:13:12.518 --> 01:13:13.919
Yeah,
put it on, put it on!

01:13:17.089 --> 01:13:19.656
Something like this I should
probably save for a special occasion.

01:13:19.658 --> 01:13:21.757
What could be more
special than right now?

01:13:21.759 --> 01:13:24.296
- Mmm-hmm.
- Fine. I'll try it on.

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.235
It... It's...

01:13:31.103 --> 01:13:32.236
A shirt.

01:13:32.238 --> 01:13:34.273
See?
It fits perfectly.

01:13:35.307 --> 01:13:36.540
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, guys.

01:13:36.542 --> 01:13:38.774
Look at that. Look at these
stickers on these helmets.

01:13:38.776 --> 01:13:41.744
Oh, look, you got...
You got Rainbow Dash.

01:13:41.746 --> 01:13:45.215
- Known for her loyalty.
- Oh, thanks, guys!

01:13:45.217 --> 01:13:46.917
Oh, no, you didn't.

01:13:46.919 --> 01:13:49.720
No, you didn't! Shut up!
Get out of here!

01:13:49.722 --> 01:13:51.221
I got Fluttershy.

01:13:51.223 --> 01:13:53.523
- Known for her kindness.
- Aww.

01:13:53.525 --> 01:13:55.859
Thank you, Zoey.
Oh, wait, wait.

01:13:55.861 --> 01:13:58.962
Axe, you got...
Pinkie Pie?

01:13:58.964 --> 01:14:00.430
What's wrong
with Pinkie Pie?

01:14:00.432 --> 01:14:02.666
Nothing wrong with it.
Just that Pinkie Pie's known

01:14:02.668 --> 01:14:05.803
all over the Kingdom of Equestria
for her mad-infectious laughter.

01:14:12.911 --> 01:14:16.048
Oh, my gosh. What's going on?

01:14:17.349 --> 01:14:19.485
- Have you ever seen that before?
- Never seen it before!

01:14:44.710 --> 01:14:46.378
You can make sound.

01:14:46.712 --> 01:14:48.111
He can sing!

01:14:48.113 --> 01:14:50.480
What's everybody
doing standing around?

01:14:50.482 --> 01:14:52.215
Who wants to party? Whoo!

01:14:52.217 --> 01:14:53.450
Me!

01:15:08.734 --> 01:15:10.135
Watch it.

01:15:12.504 --> 01:15:14.106
Oh! Oh! Oh...

01:15:16.608 --> 01:15:18.210
Bring it! Come on!

01:15:20.479 --> 01:15:22.179
Ow!

01:15:22.181 --> 01:15:24.781
Hey, hey, hold it!
You missed!

01:15:24.783 --> 01:15:26.883
You missed! Sucker!

01:15:26.885 --> 01:15:29.521
- Throw! Come on, throw!
- I got it!

01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:33.359
Hey, Zoey. Zoey!

01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:40.099
I got you.
Come on, hurry.

01:15:42.034 --> 01:15:44.470
Whoa!

01:15:47.172 --> 01:15:49.908
No, I'm fine.
I'm great. Let's go.

01:16:12.297 --> 01:16:15.298
Here we go now! Don't drop it,
don't drop it, don't drop it...

01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:17.467
- Don't make it fall.
- Shh!

01:16:17.469 --> 01:16:19.069
- Shh!
- Look out!

01:16:19.071 --> 01:16:21.538
- Easy!
- Come on, man.

01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:24.608
- Don't mess up!
- Okay, well, now it's over.

01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:27.110
...the Jaws of Life.

01:16:27.112 --> 01:16:28.912
Wait, is that why it's
called "the Jaws of Life"?

01:16:28.914 --> 01:16:31.214
They're gonna fall in love.

01:16:31.216 --> 01:16:33.950
Then they're gonna
move in together.

01:16:33.952 --> 01:16:36.221
They're gonna rely
on each other for everything.

01:16:37.423 --> 01:16:40.023
Who's gonna need me now?

01:16:47.232 --> 01:16:49.435
Don't drop it.
Don't drop it.

01:17:02.916 --> 01:17:06.351
Supe! Supe! Supe!

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:09.786
Hey!

01:17:15.427 --> 01:17:17.629
This is supposed to be
a fire depot!

01:17:22.936 --> 01:17:24.470
Jenga!

01:17:28.507 --> 01:17:30.006
Commander Richards!

01:17:30.008 --> 01:17:31.675
You said you weren't gonna
show up until tomorrow.

01:17:31.677 --> 01:17:34.311
Kinda takes the surprise
out of "surprise inspection"

01:17:34.313 --> 01:17:36.446
to show up
on the day I said.

01:17:36.448 --> 01:17:40.250
Besides, look what
I would have missed.

01:17:40.252 --> 01:17:43.689
I can see seven code
violations from where I stand.

01:17:45.190 --> 01:17:46.423
You heard the Commander!

01:17:46.425 --> 01:17:48.425
Who authorized
putting this stuff up anyway?

01:17:48.427 --> 01:17:50.594
Um... Somebody?

01:17:50.596 --> 01:17:53.098
You tell that man
to pack his bags and go!

01:17:53.699 --> 01:17:55.565
Um... Okay.

01:17:55.567 --> 01:17:58.903
Carson, who do these
children belong to?

01:17:58.905 --> 01:18:00.639
Hello! Hello!

01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:06.276
Oh, great.
Another party guest.

01:18:06.278 --> 01:18:08.278
Patty Welch,
Child Protective Services.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:11.715
I take it these are
the children we talked about.

01:18:11.717 --> 01:18:15.020
I thought you were gonna give us
the day to celebrate together.

01:18:17.389 --> 01:18:20.190
I was. I told her
not to come until tomorrow.

01:18:20.192 --> 01:18:21.491
I told you that!

01:18:21.493 --> 01:18:23.693
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:18:23.695 --> 01:18:26.162
You see, CPS is not
a fast-food restaurant.

01:18:26.164 --> 01:18:27.832
- You don't get to "have it your way."
- Tea?

01:18:27.834 --> 01:18:30.233
We've been looking for these
children for the past month.

01:18:30.235 --> 01:18:33.136
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you</i>

01:18:33.138 --> 01:18:36.007
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you</i>

01:18:36.009 --> 01:18:40.343
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Zoey</i>

01:18:40.345 --> 01:18:45.282
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪</i>

01:18:45.284 --> 01:18:46.318
No!

01:18:49.288 --> 01:18:51.423
I got it!

01:19:02.067 --> 01:19:03.433
Aw, Come on!

01:19:03.435 --> 01:19:05.535
I can't believe that
you are Dan Carson's boy.

01:19:05.537 --> 01:19:08.271
Hey! You can't talk
to Supe like that.

01:19:08.273 --> 01:19:09.573
He's right.

01:19:09.575 --> 01:19:12.309
This is what happens
when you let your guard down.

01:19:12.311 --> 01:19:14.644
- Jake...
- You don't understand.

01:19:14.646 --> 01:19:17.147
If I get distracted,
I can't do this job effectively.

01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:18.483
Without this job...

01:19:19.418 --> 01:19:20.885
What am I?

01:19:20.887 --> 01:19:22.621
Now I think
I've heard enough.

01:19:25.257 --> 01:19:27.225
Where are the kids?

01:19:28.694 --> 01:19:29.862
We had...

01:19:34.266 --> 01:19:36.099
Where's my Humvee?

01:19:36.101 --> 01:19:38.035
Do you have your keys?

01:19:38.037 --> 01:19:40.403
- No.
- Yup, that's what she does.

01:19:40.405 --> 01:19:41.738
- We should...
- Take your truck, right.

01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:43.573
- My tires are flat.
- Mine, too!

01:19:43.575 --> 01:19:44.576
I got this.

01:19:46.913 --> 01:19:49.679
Brynn, what are we doing?

01:19:49.681 --> 01:19:51.048
I'll figure something out.

01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:53.216
- Bunny.
- I'll get you another one, Zoey.

01:19:53.218 --> 01:19:54.852
- Bunny.
- We can't!

01:19:54.854 --> 01:19:55.953
Bunny!

01:20:32.724 --> 01:20:35.394
I'm stuck. I'm stuck!

01:20:36.395 --> 01:20:38.330
It's gonna be okay, Zoey.

01:20:39.731 --> 01:20:41.466
Wait. I have an idea.

01:20:44.569 --> 01:20:46.670
You're breaking every protocol
in the book, Superintendent.

01:20:46.672 --> 01:20:48.204
With all due respect,
Commander,

01:20:48.206 --> 01:20:51.042
we will look for these kids
until I know they're okay.

01:20:51.044 --> 01:20:53.376
I'm ordering you
to turn this chopper around.

01:20:53.378 --> 01:20:54.879
Those kids are
our responsibility.

01:20:54.881 --> 01:20:57.982
- If you want out, grab a chute.
- What did you just say to me?

01:20:57.984 --> 01:21:00.953
I got contact on Will,
ten o'clock!

01:21:02.055 --> 01:21:03.520
On second thought,

01:21:03.522 --> 01:21:05.590
- I'll grab it.
- Wait, what are you doing?

01:21:12.798 --> 01:21:15.634
- Take Zoey and get out of here.
- The door's stuck.

01:21:16.836 --> 01:21:18.336
Careful, Will.

01:21:26.445 --> 01:21:28.780
It worked!
Jake's here.

01:21:31.717 --> 01:21:33.750
Brynn's stuck in there
and she can't get out.

01:21:33.752 --> 01:21:36.586
Brynn! I'm gonna
get a line to you!

01:21:36.588 --> 01:21:38.155
I can't secure the line
and hold it.

01:21:38.157 --> 01:21:39.656
- Think you can get it to her?
- Yeah.

01:21:39.658 --> 01:21:42.193
Zoey, sweetie, I just need you to
go sit on that rock over there.

01:21:42.195 --> 01:21:45.795
Will, pass your sister this knife
and line through the window.

01:21:45.797 --> 01:21:48.467
She needs to tie it
around her waist, okay?

01:21:49.102 --> 01:21:51.436
You're good to go. Go.

01:21:52.237 --> 01:21:54.105
Hang in there, Brynn!

01:21:54.107 --> 01:21:55.307
Grab it!

01:21:58.477 --> 01:22:00.746
Will, what are you doing?
Don't climb in here.

01:22:02.215 --> 01:22:03.747
Will!

01:22:03.749 --> 01:22:06.618
- Get out of the car!
- Everything's gonna be okay.

01:22:17.796 --> 01:22:18.931
Jake!

01:22:39.852 --> 01:22:41.518
Come on.

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:43.686
Good, good, good.
Come on.

01:22:43.688 --> 01:22:47.492
That's it, I got you.
Okay. I got you.

01:22:50.029 --> 01:22:51.763
You're okay.

01:22:52.597 --> 01:22:54.397
And you...

01:22:54.399 --> 01:22:56.967
Are my hero.
You did great!

01:22:56.969 --> 01:22:58.135
My hero.

01:22:58.137 --> 01:23:00.703
Oh, man. Oh!

01:23:00.705 --> 01:23:02.707
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:23:08.313 --> 01:23:09.882
I thought you never cried.

01:23:10.649 --> 01:23:12.116
Please don't tell anybody.

01:23:43.149 --> 01:23:45.615
- Here, take this one.
- Okay, got it.

01:23:45.617 --> 01:23:47.750
- And this one.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:23:47.752 --> 01:23:49.989
- Nice.
- And this one.

01:23:51.656 --> 01:23:54.791
...'cause the sun
is really great. Yeah.

01:23:54.793 --> 01:23:56.961
I'm really impressed
with how you took care

01:23:56.963 --> 01:23:58.461
of your brother and sister.

01:23:58.463 --> 01:24:01.298
Most people would not
do that. You're...

01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:03.834
- You're awesome.
- Thanks.

01:24:06.605 --> 01:24:08.373
All right, come here.

01:24:13.312 --> 01:24:16.813
One day, I'm gonna be
a hero, just like you.

01:24:16.815 --> 01:24:18.414
You already are,
little brotherman.

01:24:18.416 --> 01:24:20.150
You already are.
Come on, put it right there.

01:24:20.152 --> 01:24:22.485
Ah... Yeah!

01:24:22.487 --> 01:24:23.923
Smokejumpers!

01:24:33.099 --> 01:24:35.332
I don't think so.

01:24:35.334 --> 01:24:36.903
Okay, she can
hold it for a bit.

01:24:41.473 --> 01:24:43.606
- Thank you.
- <i>I love you.</i>

01:24:54.954 --> 01:24:56.055
That's for you.

01:24:56.688 --> 01:24:57.888
Can you draw me something?

01:24:57.890 --> 01:25:00.059
Sure. I'll draw you
with hair.

01:25:03.129 --> 01:25:04.663
Where's Supe?

01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:15.141
- Sir.
- No. As you were.

01:25:17.877 --> 01:25:19.542
Look, Carson...

01:25:19.544 --> 01:25:22.781
You said earlier,
if you had any distractions,

01:25:23.448 --> 01:25:24.681
you couldn't do this job.

01:25:24.683 --> 01:25:26.185
I don't think
that's true.

01:25:27.519 --> 01:25:31.021
The people you care about
and that care about you

01:25:31.023 --> 01:25:32.522
aren't distractions.

01:25:32.524 --> 01:25:35.061
They're the thing
that keeps you going.

01:25:36.594 --> 01:25:39.595
I know we got off
to a rocky start.

01:25:39.597 --> 01:25:43.133
But after seeing
what you did back there,

01:25:43.135 --> 01:25:47.171
there's no doubt in my mind
that you're the man for the job.

01:25:47.173 --> 01:25:48.506
Thank you, sir.

01:25:50.809 --> 01:25:52.011
Let me know.

01:26:13.933 --> 01:26:16.632
Oh, here he is!
Let's wrap this up.

01:26:16.634 --> 01:26:19.003
Come on, guys,
get out. It's all right.

01:26:19.005 --> 01:26:20.904
Okay, come on. Get out.
Everybody out.

01:26:20.906 --> 01:26:23.040
Patty, are you familiar
with the Safe Haven Law?

01:26:23.042 --> 01:26:26.045
That is a stupid question.
Yes, of course I am.

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:31.315
Children cannot be relinquished until
the proper authorities are involved.

01:26:31.317 --> 01:26:34.118
Yeah. I am
the proper authority.

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:37.321
Don't leave. Stay. With me.

01:26:37.323 --> 01:26:39.822
You mean here?
In the depot?

01:26:39.824 --> 01:26:42.359
I don't live here full-time.
I have a house.

01:26:42.361 --> 01:26:43.863
You do?

01:26:44.562 --> 01:26:46.030
You do?

01:26:46.032 --> 01:26:49.266
Yeah... Hello. This is not
how adoption works.

01:26:49.268 --> 01:26:53.003
Okay? First of all, there's paperwork,
interviews, background checks.

01:26:53.005 --> 01:26:56.539
Yeah. Get it all started.
I'm not going anywhere.

01:26:56.541 --> 01:26:58.909
And I have three children
I am not relinquishing.

01:26:58.911 --> 01:27:02.012
What about
your big dream job?

01:27:02.014 --> 01:27:04.781
Somebody told me once that
kids are kind of like fire.

01:27:04.783 --> 01:27:09.086
You can't control them, you just got to
contain 'em till they burn themselves out.

01:27:09.088 --> 01:27:11.190
That sounds like
a dream job to me.

01:27:12.058 --> 01:27:13.159
Right?

01:27:21.467 --> 01:27:22.667
Oh!

01:27:25.737 --> 01:27:27.504
Come on, everybody,

01:27:27.506 --> 01:27:29.106
we don't have
a second to lose.

01:27:29.108 --> 01:27:30.276
Let's do this.

01:27:36.148 --> 01:27:39.085
Okay, everybody, we gotta be
at the courthouse by 1400...

01:27:39.351 --> 01:27:40.785
2:00.

01:27:49.428 --> 01:27:52.231
Hey! What's up?
Come on, man!

01:27:53.032 --> 01:27:54.100
Here we go!

01:27:56.836 --> 01:27:58.003
Ta-da!

01:28:00.539 --> 01:28:02.007
Here comes the bride.

01:28:02.508 --> 01:28:03.773
Alexa, play BTS.

01:28:03.775 --> 01:28:05.675
Burning Up Fire <i>by BTS.</i>

01:28:29.101 --> 01:28:30.336
Sparkle Pony!

01:28:30.903 --> 01:28:33.137
Sparkle Pony, hurray!

01:28:33.139 --> 01:28:34.238
All right...

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:37.640
- Where's my Wedding Crew at?
- Everywhere!

01:28:37.642 --> 01:28:39.011
Move out!

01:28:41.679 --> 01:28:43.213
You ready to be Mrs. Fun?

01:28:43.215 --> 01:28:45.217
That's Doctor Fun, Mister.

01:28:48.587 --> 01:28:50.356
Yeah, hit it,
hit it. Hit it.

01:28:57.496 --> 01:28:59.563
Whoo! Look at that!

01:28:59.565 --> 01:29:02.332
- Look at that!
- Oh, my God!

01:29:02.334 --> 01:29:03.768
Killin' it,
killin' it!

01:29:19.985 --> 01:29:22.286
Don't underestimate the powers

01:29:22.288 --> 01:29:24.754
of the dark side of the Force.

01:29:30.396 --> 01:29:31.761
There's too much.

01:29:31.763 --> 01:29:33.332
That's not a real child.

01:29:38.736 --> 01:29:41.939
Look at me. Look at me.
Stay with me.

01:29:41.941 --> 01:29:44.141
No, that's a...

01:29:44.143 --> 01:29:45.808
...to collect water
for the dumps...

01:29:45.810 --> 01:29:47.044
- For their dumps.
- Yeah.

01:29:47.046 --> 01:29:49.079
I'm not gonna
be able to say that line.

01:29:49.081 --> 01:29:52.282
You will not use Fisher Lake to
collect water for their dumps.

01:29:52.284 --> 01:29:55.986
And now it looks like you're
gonna have to sign it, too.

01:29:55.988 --> 01:29:57.421
...to collect water
for their dumps.

01:29:57.423 --> 01:30:00.392
And now it looks like I'm
gonna have to...

01:30:07.666 --> 01:30:09.168
Does he always
carry that axe?

01:30:12.972 --> 01:30:15.005
Why y'all looking at me?

01:30:15.007 --> 01:30:17.409
Because you're supposed
to give an answer.

01:30:18.644 --> 01:30:21.178
Keep rolling,
the same spot for John.

01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:23.849
And action.

01:30:29.455 --> 01:30:32.057
You were given a chance.
You were given an opportunity...

01:30:36.996 --> 01:30:38.829
Did I get out of frame?

01:30:38.831 --> 01:30:40.897
I can do it better!
Don't... I know I can.

01:30:40.899 --> 01:30:43.300
- I can't do it better.
- I know he cannot.

01:30:45.537 --> 01:30:47.537
Millennials!

01:30:48.741 --> 01:30:50.340
Superintendent Jake Carson.

01:30:50.342 --> 01:30:52.542
And you can call me that,
the whole thing.

01:30:52.544 --> 01:30:54.011
This is...

01:30:54.013 --> 01:30:55.879
- Uh...
- This is Keegan. He left.

01:30:55.881 --> 01:30:57.383
Captain, did you...

01:30:58.550 --> 01:31:00.617
Excuse me... Sir.

01:31:04.156 --> 01:31:06.425
Hey, we made it.
Let's go eat.

01:31:11.263 --> 01:31:14.665
Oh, my God,
he would be so...

01:31:14.667 --> 01:31:16.935
Big Dan would be
so proud.

01:31:50.446 --> 01:31:55.446
