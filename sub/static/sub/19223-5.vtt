WEBVTT

00:04.337 --> 00:06.538
- are you guys ready for lunch?

00:06.573 --> 00:08.573
Guys, it's 80 degrees outside.

00:08.608 --> 00:10.709
- First day of cold season,
newbie.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.155
- It's when all
the icy super villians

00:12.179 --> 00:13.645
start fighting
and freezing stuff.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.391
I wonder who's coming
to charm city this year.

00:15.415 --> 00:16.815
Mr. Freeze, captain cold...

00:16.850 --> 00:18.650
- Frostbite, killer frost...
- Mm.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.419
- Minister blizzard...
- Snow patrol.

00:20.454 --> 00:21.864
Wait, that's a band,
but they're coming to town.

00:21.888 --> 00:23.388
- Ooh.
- I'm not scared

00:23.423 --> 00:26.191
of a few flurries, okay?
I am from the midwest.

00:26.226 --> 00:28.593
I know what real cold is.

00:41.608 --> 00:43.508
- you were saying?

00:43.543 --> 00:45.343
- Yep, that's real cold.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.045
Cold season is
impossible to dress for.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.481
It's like a wedding
on the beach.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.149
- Linen and no socks.
Not complicated.

01:24.184 --> 01:25.728
- You should get a pair
of teddy's gloves.

01:25.752 --> 01:27.752
- Oh.

01:27.787 --> 01:28.887
These?

01:28.922 --> 01:30.322
Designed them myself.

01:30.357 --> 01:32.068
They heat my hands
to the perfect temperature.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.959
They can also defrost
your car door

01:33.994 --> 01:36.328
or reheat your coffee.

01:36.363 --> 01:38.296
Heh?
- Hmm.

01:38.331 --> 01:40.966
- Ah.

01:41.001 --> 01:42.467
- That was a soda.
- Yeah.

01:42.502 --> 01:45.137
- Anyways,
I have some very exciting news.

01:45.172 --> 01:47.405
- Is it actually exciting
or is it emily exciting?

01:47.440 --> 01:49.007
- What the hell
is "emily exciting"?

01:49.042 --> 01:51.343
- Finding a conflict-free brand
of hummus.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.078
- Having another shopper
at anthropologie

01:53.113 --> 01:54.246
ask if you work there.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.491
- Getting retweeted
by lena dunham.

01:55.515 --> 01:56.781
- She didn't just retweet me.

01:56.816 --> 01:57.983
She quoted my tweet

01:58.018 --> 02:00.185
and wrote "so much this."

02:00.220 --> 02:01.686
anyways, you guys'll like this.

02:01.721 --> 02:03.688
Wayne industries
is holding a contest

02:03.723 --> 02:05.690
that awards $100,000

02:05.725 --> 02:07.792
to the employee
who comes up with an invention

02:07.827 --> 02:11.696
that, "embodies the triumph
of the human spirit."

02:11.731 --> 02:15.133
- whoa, that is the exact review
I wrote for my barber.

02:15.168 --> 02:16.935
I mean, this doesn't
just happen, guys.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.303
- Oh, I know.
- I'm sorry,

02:18.338 --> 02:20.005
you losers
talking about entering

02:20.040 --> 02:21.506
the wayne innovation contest?

02:21.541 --> 02:23.475
- Excuse me.
Who are you?

02:23.510 --> 02:24.943
- Zane and anton,

02:24.978 --> 02:27.546
two wayne x asshats.

02:27.581 --> 02:28.980
Oh, they think they're so cool

02:29.015 --> 02:30.626
because they work in
a super-elite division

02:30.650 --> 02:32.484
that makes
cutting-edge technology

02:32.519 --> 02:33.885
that shapes our future.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.687
- That actually does sound
pretty cool.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.123
- It is.
- And they get free soda.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.058
- We do.
- Why wouldn't we enter

02:40.093 --> 02:41.960
the wayne innovation contest?

02:41.995 --> 02:44.229
- Because no one gives a crap
about wayne security r&d.

02:44.264 --> 02:46.731
You make widgets.
You're nobodies.

02:46.766 --> 02:48.200
- Yeah.

02:48.235 --> 02:51.303
- Ugh, our division matters.
We are not nobodies.

02:51.338 --> 02:54.639
- Fyi, guys, corporate gave away
your parking spots.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.519
So starting next week,
you're gonna have to park

02:56.543 --> 02:59.377
across the street
under the bridge that leaks tar.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.487
- oh.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.756
- This child-sized car
arrived for you.

03:11.791 --> 03:13.225
Were you expecting
a full-size one

03:13.260 --> 03:15.026
or is it because
your father didn't hug you?

03:15.061 --> 03:16.872
- My bugatti is
because my father didn't hug me,

03:16.896 --> 03:19.097
this is for an actual child.
- But you hate those.

03:19.132 --> 03:21.210
- I know, but I'm going away
with chelsea this weekend

03:21.234 --> 03:23.702
and she's insisting
on bringing her son.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.748
- Isn't no kids in the agreement
that you make women sign

03:25.772 --> 03:28.006
before you date them?
- No, the agreement states

03:28.041 --> 03:30.342
that we can't make any kids,

03:30.377 --> 03:32.010
but it doesn't account

03:32.045 --> 03:34.079
for any pre-existing conditions.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.619
It's broken
into hundreds of pieces.

03:40.654 --> 03:43.622
There's a ransom note.
- Those are instructions.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.924
It's in pieces because
you have to put it together.

03:48.094 --> 03:49.928
- I can't do this.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.564
You know, jackie,
I'm gonna need you to...

03:54.000 --> 03:55.900
Old girl's still got some moves.

03:55.935 --> 03:58.803
- I don't know about you guys,
but hearing those wayne x punks

03:58.838 --> 04:01.940
tells us we're nobodies got me
really excited for this contest.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.908
- Oh, it had
the opposite effect on me.

04:03.943 --> 04:05.944
I am very demoralized.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.879
Teddy, what about you?

04:07.914 --> 04:09.214
Oh, they weren't
referring to me.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.283
I think it was more like
steve, susan, wendy.

04:11.318 --> 04:13.051
- Wendy's right there.
- Nah, it's cool.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.220
I mean, I don't not suck.
- See?

04:15.255 --> 04:17.488
- What about your heat gloves?
They're amazing.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.923
Enter those
and we could win this.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.437
- I mean,
my heat gloves would kill it,

04:21.461 --> 04:23.895
fo' sho, but I got
a lot on my plate, so...

04:23.930 --> 04:26.598
- Oh, sure.
I get it.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.833
You know, I built you up
too much in my head.

04:28.868 --> 04:31.102
I did the same thing
with the "hobbit" movies.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.341
- I am not the "hobbit" movies.

04:36.376 --> 04:38.576
- That sounds like something
a "hobbit" movie would say.

04:41.648 --> 04:43.025
- I can't argue with that logic.
I'm in.

04:43.049 --> 04:44.949
Yeah, suck it, wayne x.

04:44.984 --> 04:46.785
- I am re-moralized!

04:46.820 --> 04:48.687
Ooh.

04:48.722 --> 04:49.932
- Probably need
to make a few tweaks.

04:49.956 --> 04:50.956
- Yeah.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.529
- benny!
Uh, charles!

04:57.564 --> 04:59.097
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, no.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.298
He has the look.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.833
- The "I'm gonna
blow up your day

05:01.868 --> 05:03.646
by making you do some annoying
personal task" look.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.970
- Hey, guys.
I was wondering...

05:06.005 --> 05:07.672
- Diarrhea.
- Period.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.974
Ah, there he is!

05:10.009 --> 05:12.610
Ron john silvers.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.145
Ron-athan taylor thomas.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.214
Linda ronstadt.

05:16.249 --> 05:19.784
- If you have to do that,
I'd prefer ronda rousey.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.187
- I have a treat for you.
I need you to build this car.

05:22.222 --> 05:24.489
- But I was gonna go sledding
for cold season.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.057
You know I love winter.

05:26.092 --> 05:28.526
- The thrill of sledding,
that is fleeting,

05:28.561 --> 05:29.828
but the joy of obeying

05:29.863 --> 05:31.796
a direct order
from your superior,

05:31.831 --> 05:33.832
that lasts forever.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.033
You the man, ronda.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.202
- But, I mean...

05:41.508 --> 05:43.041
- okay, this is
prototype number three,

05:43.076 --> 05:44.309
test number two.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.810
My assistant emily will attempt

05:45.845 --> 05:47.712
to melt the frost
off this car door handle.

05:49.048 --> 05:51.149
These cold mornings
are the worst.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.017
Unless...

05:59.893 --> 06:01.726
and now I can make it
to my grandparents'

06:01.761 --> 06:03.728
50th anniversary.

06:03.763 --> 06:05.107
- I could do
without the backstory.

06:05.131 --> 06:06.731
- Sorry.
I'm taking an improv class.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.666
- Okay, so we've mastered
low temperatures.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.935
Now, let's heat things up.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.880
- holy crap.
Teddy, these are a game-changer.

06:21.915 --> 06:24.349
The judges are gonna
see your gloves and say,

06:24.384 --> 06:26.885
wayne security is
just as relevant as wayne x

06:26.920 --> 06:30.855
and the guys who made this is
most definitely not a nobody.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.357
- Of course I'm not a nobody,

06:32.392 --> 06:34.092
but you know judges,
they're unpredictable,

06:34.127 --> 06:35.604
and if they were dumb
and they didn't pick mine,

06:35.628 --> 06:37.562
I mean, I'm still obviously

06:37.597 --> 06:39.531
immensely talented and...

06:39.566 --> 06:41.533
Oh, my god.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.067
There's still kernels
left in the bag.

06:43.102 --> 06:44.736
- So what?
There's always kernels

06:44.771 --> 06:46.282
left in the bag.
- Okay, the gloves aren't ready.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.072
There's not
an even distribution of heat

06:48.107 --> 06:49.585
and we haven't even checked
to see if you get a rash.

06:49.609 --> 06:51.409
- They are ready.
- They're not,

06:51.444 --> 06:53.222
and I can't submit a product
that's not ready.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.380
It's not fair to the gloves.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.815
- But two minutes ago,
you just...

06:56.850 --> 06:58.060
- there's kernels
in the bag, emily.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.285
There's kernels in the bag!

07:00.320 --> 07:02.620
There's kernels in the bag!

07:06.793 --> 07:08.593
- what's up, really hot loser?

07:08.628 --> 07:10.295
You guys get your submission in?

07:10.330 --> 07:12.096
- Oh, we've got something.

07:12.131 --> 07:14.799
It is just so ahead of its time

07:14.834 --> 07:16.679
we're gonna hold off
submitting it till next year.

07:16.703 --> 07:18.336
- Admit it.
You're a nobody,

07:18.371 --> 07:20.338
you work with nobodies,

07:20.373 --> 07:22.674
and the best you could hope for
is to marry one of us.

07:22.709 --> 07:25.009
- You know what, zane?
You're gonna regret saying that

07:25.044 --> 07:27.278
because you just
convinced us to submit,

07:27.313 --> 07:28.947
and we're gonna win.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.153
It's classic zane and emily

07:35.188 --> 07:37.922
will they, won't they.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.624
- Why do you look smugger
than usual?

07:39.659 --> 07:42.093
Which is already
so incredibly smug.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.995
- Well, because this division
is going to win

07:44.030 --> 07:45.663
the wayne innovation prize.

07:45.698 --> 07:47.198
I submitted teddy's gloves.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.033
- Please tell me you didn't.
- Why not?

07:49.068 --> 07:51.102
- Let me tell you
a little story.

07:52.672 --> 07:54.672
Five years ago,
teddy entered a competition

07:54.707 --> 07:57.275
to redesign
the wayne industries logo.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.810
- Why are you using
an ominous voice?

07:58.845 --> 07:59.878
- You'll see.

08:03.883 --> 08:05.884
<i>He threw himself
into the competition,</i>

08:05.919 --> 08:07.785
and convinced himself
that he was going to win,

08:07.820 --> 08:10.288
and then when he didn't,
he lashed out at everyone...

08:13.059 --> 08:14.392
<i>and started punishing himself.</i>

08:14.427 --> 08:15.994
<i>- Oh, come on.</i>

08:16.029 --> 08:17.462
<i>- He took to wearing
cargo shorts,</i>

08:17.497 --> 08:19.664
<i>switched to
an aol email address,</i>

08:19.699 --> 08:21.499
<i>and used
all of his vacation days</i>

08:21.534 --> 08:23.334
<i>to go to tampa.
- Tampa?</i>

08:23.369 --> 08:26.004
That's not even the nicest part
of central florida.

08:26.039 --> 08:29.507
Anyways, it doesn't matter
because we're going to win.

08:29.542 --> 08:30.975
- You better hope so,

08:31.010 --> 08:33.511
otherwise you're
about to break teddy.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.149
Tampa.

08:38.183 --> 08:39.551
- Stop using that voice.

08:45.224 --> 08:47.859
- So, teddy...
- Uh-huh?

08:47.894 --> 08:50.528
- I thought
your gloves were brilliant...

08:50.563 --> 08:52.430
And I entered them
into the contest.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.713
- I told you they weren't ready
and you went behind my back?

08:57.737 --> 08:59.504
- Teddy, I...
- Don't "teddy" me.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.550
This is the ultimate betrayal.
This is worst than the time

09:01.574 --> 09:03.052
that wendy bought
the same glasses as me.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.709
That was awful!
- Okay, hold on!

09:04.744 --> 09:06.210
How would you feel

09:06.245 --> 09:09.280
if I told you
you're in the finals?

09:09.315 --> 09:12.450
- I'm in the finals?
- You bet your sweet ass.

09:12.485 --> 09:15.086
Oh, my god.

09:15.121 --> 09:16.921
I mean, I didn't even know
there were finals.

09:16.956 --> 09:18.623
I mean, obviously
they're dope gloves.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.436
I just didn't know how dope.
Apparently the answer was

09:20.460 --> 09:22.260
the dopest.

09:22.295 --> 09:26.230
Emily, thank you
for making me realize

09:26.265 --> 09:27.599
I'm a winner.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.133
- Or a finalist.

09:29.168 --> 09:30.602
- yes!

09:30.637 --> 09:32.804
- There are no finals.
You just made that up.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.272
- I didn't know what to do.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.707
I could see it in his eyes,

09:35.742 --> 09:38.242
he was already halfway to tampa.

09:38.277 --> 09:39.644
It'll all be fine, right?

09:39.679 --> 09:41.913
- Mom, dad, yeah.

09:41.948 --> 09:43.748
I got huge news.
No, not a girlfriend,

09:43.783 --> 09:45.263
but you're still
gonna be proud of me.

09:46.953 --> 09:49.387
- I have a feeling this
is all gonna end with a call

09:49.422 --> 09:51.089
from the busch gardens
coroner's office.

09:52.525 --> 09:55.159
It's gonna be cold.

09:58.197 --> 09:59.797
<i>- Ron!</i>
- Van?

09:59.832 --> 10:01.410
I thought you were on vacation
with your girlfriend

10:01.434 --> 10:03.167
and her son?
<i>- We have a problem.</i>

10:03.202 --> 10:05.303
<i>Evidently, dylan,
that's a girl's name,</i>

10:05.338 --> 10:07.138
<i>and she does not like
that car you built.</i>

10:07.173 --> 10:09.641
<i>- You're just trying
to have sex with my mom.</i>

10:09.676 --> 10:12.243
<i>- Yeah, we've established that.
Look, I have sent you</i>

10:12.278 --> 10:13.311
<i>a toy wonder woman jet.</i>

10:13.346 --> 10:14.586
<i>I need you to put that together</i>

10:14.614 --> 10:15.780
<i>and have it couriered to me.</i>

10:15.815 --> 10:17.749
- Isn't her jet invisible?

10:17.784 --> 10:18.850
<i>- Yes.</i>

10:18.885 --> 10:21.519
<i>Assembly is gonna be a bitch.</i>

10:21.554 --> 10:23.421
- Ron, you have
to set boundaries,

10:23.456 --> 10:25.623
and not let people
take advantage of you.

10:25.658 --> 10:27.158
Do you think
I would have stopped

10:27.193 --> 10:28.626
having sex in susan's car

10:28.661 --> 10:30.762
if she hadn't started
hiding her keys?

10:30.797 --> 10:32.697
- You still have sex
in susan's car.

10:32.732 --> 10:35.833
- The point is he is not gonna
stop taking advantage of you

10:35.868 --> 10:38.636
unless you push back,
and if you don't push back now,

10:38.671 --> 10:41.039
one day,
you're going to explode.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.808
- I appreciate your concern,
but I'm a big boy

10:43.843 --> 10:46.344
and I know when I'm being
taken advantage of.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.046
- Fine.

10:48.081 --> 10:51.315
Hey, can I have your car keys?
- Oh, sure.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.517
- Huh.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.520
Hey, loser.

10:55.555 --> 10:56.788
You wanna go out with me?
- No.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.523
Why would you think that?

10:58.558 --> 11:00.391
- Uh, because
I've been negging you hard.

11:00.426 --> 11:01.670
All of reddit said
this would work.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.461
- What're you doing down here?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.873
- We won
the wayne innovation prize,

11:04.897 --> 11:06.698
so we're here to gloat.
- That's right.

11:06.733 --> 11:08.866
- What?

11:11.204 --> 11:12.336
- she's not that hot.

11:12.371 --> 11:13.805
- She is.
- Yeah, she is.

11:23.049 --> 11:24.182
- ron, where's teddy?

11:24.217 --> 11:25.983
- Uh, he called in sick.

11:26.018 --> 11:29.520
- Oh, no.
He must be devastated.

11:29.555 --> 11:31.656
- Wait, no, no, no, no.
No!

11:31.691 --> 11:35.226
I just finished
putting it together.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.065
- teddy.
Oh, thank god you're here.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.511
For a second I thought
you might have already

11:42.535 --> 11:44.102
caught a flight to tampa.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.070
- I have been meaning
to check out busch gardens.

11:46.105 --> 11:47.950
What're you doing here?
- I know it must really hurt

11:47.974 --> 11:49.885
that you didn't win
the wayne innovation contest,

11:49.909 --> 11:51.776
but I just want you to know...
- I didn't win?

11:51.811 --> 11:53.544
- You didn't know?

11:53.579 --> 11:55.546
- Teddy, who's this?

11:58.785 --> 12:00.251
- oh...

12:00.286 --> 12:01.619
you have guests.

12:01.654 --> 12:04.288
- Hello.
I'm teddy's father, sunil.

12:04.323 --> 12:08.059
This is his mother, nisha,
and his brother ajay.

12:08.094 --> 12:10.361
- Are you here
for ajay's going-away dinner?

12:10.396 --> 12:13.030
- She's not.
- Where's he going?

12:13.065 --> 12:14.565
- Outer space.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.467
- I thought you said
your brother was a doctor.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.703
- He's an astronaut
and a doctor.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.605
- The technical term
is space doctor.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.441
- What were you saying
about teddy and that contest?

12:23.476 --> 12:25.443
- Did he win?
- Well, you know,

12:25.478 --> 12:27.311
winning is really just
a social con...

12:27.346 --> 12:31.282
- I lost, and I'm so glad that
we're all here for this moment

12:31.317 --> 12:32.917
when I found out.
- Teddy, do you mind

12:32.952 --> 12:34.418
keeping it down?
I gotta take this.

12:34.453 --> 12:35.764
- This is my apartment,
all right?

12:35.788 --> 12:37.488
Your dumb friends can wait.

12:37.523 --> 12:40.057
- Mr. President.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.460
Yes, thank you.
Thank you, sir.

12:48.935 --> 12:49.935
- hey.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.270
- Hey.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.272
- So I just wanna say

12:54.307 --> 12:55.907
I am really sorry.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.575
- Don't be.
It's totally fine.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.810
- It is?

12:58.845 --> 13:00.311
- Emily, I'm a grown man.

13:00.346 --> 13:01.757
All right?
It's just a stupid contest.

13:01.781 --> 13:02.947
I'll get 'em next year.

13:02.982 --> 13:04.982
- Oh.
Okay, cool.

13:05.017 --> 13:07.418
Well, in that case, we could
use your help on a redesign.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.353
- I would love
to take a look at it.

13:09.388 --> 13:12.256
- That is a great attitude,
teddy.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.493
You seem fine
and I did nothing wrong.

13:16.996 --> 13:18.429
So, as you can see,

13:18.464 --> 13:20.131
the packaging
of this fear gas detector

13:20.166 --> 13:22.934
needs a little work.
- Mm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.102
Yep, yep, yep, yep.
Okay.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.370
I have a great idea.

13:26.405 --> 13:29.140
What if instead
of using molded plastic,

13:29.175 --> 13:30.775
we use...

13:33.412 --> 13:35.546
this hamburger wrapper.

13:35.581 --> 13:38.482
- Oh, like a very thin
recyclable material?

13:38.517 --> 13:41.185
- Nuh, nuh, nuh.
I mean this literal piece

13:41.220 --> 13:42.954
of ketchup-stained garbage

13:42.989 --> 13:44.388
because obviously

13:44.423 --> 13:46.357
wayne industries
doesn't appreciate quality

13:46.392 --> 13:48.826
or craftsmanship
or aesthetics whatsoever.

13:48.861 --> 13:50.795
So a garbage company

13:50.830 --> 13:52.263
gets a garbage wrapper.

13:55.935 --> 13:57.512
- I didn't wanna say this
in front of teddy,

13:57.536 --> 13:59.403
but I don't think
the wrapper's a good idea.

14:01.707 --> 14:03.307
- that's right, mr. Sled,

14:03.342 --> 14:04.709
you and I have a date

14:04.744 --> 14:07.845
with the big ol' hill
by city hall.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.347
You said it, ron.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.883
Nothing's gonna
ruin our fun today.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.318
I love you.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.991
Don't do it, ron.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.425
- The sled's right.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.561
Nothing good can come
from answering that call.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.329
- Oh, you two are
just overreacting.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.398
He's probably just calling
to say thank you.

14:28.467 --> 14:29.934
<i>- Ronda sykes.</i>

14:29.969 --> 14:32.103
<i>Hey, thank you so much
for you hard work.</i>

14:32.138 --> 14:33.938
- You're welcome, van.

14:33.973 --> 14:36.007
<i>- Ronda, I need you
to build four more</i>

14:36.042 --> 14:37.742
<i>of those girl jets
you can't see.</i>

14:37.777 --> 14:40.544
<i>Evidently dylan has a "squad"
and they have "goals."</i>

14:40.579 --> 14:42.947
<i>one of which is
posting pictures to instagram</i>

14:42.982 --> 14:45.116
<i>with the hashtag
#bitchyoucantaffordthis.</i>

14:45.151 --> 14:48.452
<i>And then
they do this snap emoji.</i>

14:48.487 --> 14:50.688
<i>I'm really coming around
on these kids.</i>

14:50.723 --> 14:52.924
- Yeah, but I was
just about to go sledding

14:52.959 --> 14:54.558
in this adorable outfit.

14:54.593 --> 14:57.061
<i>- Well, you can wear
the adorable outfit</i>

14:57.096 --> 14:59.463
<i>while you put together
those planes.</i>

15:01.767 --> 15:02.900
- no.

15:02.935 --> 15:04.302
<i>- I'm getting bad reception.</i>

15:04.337 --> 15:06.370
<i>It sounded like you said "no."</i>

15:06.405 --> 15:09.640
- I did say no
because that's not my job.

15:09.675 --> 15:12.543
<i>- Ron, neither is
giving dylan braids,</i>

15:12.578 --> 15:14.111
<i>but this morning, I did it.</i>

15:14.146 --> 15:16.547
<i>- You ruined it.</i>

15:16.582 --> 15:18.916
<i>- That is the perfect fishtail</i>

15:18.951 --> 15:20.284
<i>and you know it!</i>

15:20.319 --> 15:22.820
<i>Listen, ron,
just build the planes.</i>

15:22.855 --> 15:24.922
<i>Snap, snap, snap emojis.</i>

15:24.957 --> 15:27.058
- No, you listen.
How 'bout no

15:27.093 --> 15:29.427
because I don't wanna do it?
In fact, I didn't wanna do

15:29.462 --> 15:31.295
any of the stupid crap
you asked me to do.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.064
Not for you, not for dylan,

15:33.099 --> 15:35.833
and certainly not for her squad!
<i>- You listen to me...</i>

15:42.308 --> 15:43.841
It is possible I'm bothered

15:43.876 --> 15:46.143
by people
taking advantage of me.

15:46.178 --> 15:47.778
- No.

15:47.813 --> 15:50.247
<i>- Establishment is dead!
Establishment is dead!</i>

15:50.282 --> 15:52.583
<i>No one understands me!
Establishment is dead!</i>

15:52.618 --> 15:54.352
- How long is he going
to be like this?

15:54.387 --> 15:57.521
- Well, last time, he requested
no eye contact for eight months,

15:57.556 --> 15:58.856
but it was
a good year and a half

15:58.891 --> 16:00.958
before he stopped listening
to speed metal.

16:00.993 --> 16:01.993
This is ridiculous.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.127
<i>- Establishment is dead!</i>

16:03.162 --> 16:04.662
- Teddy, your gloves are great.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.364
You should be really proud,

16:06.399 --> 16:08.466
but you need to accept the fact
that they didn't win

16:08.501 --> 16:09.667
and move on.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.769
- No, my gloves were
a masterpiece.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.771
I should have won.
It was rigged.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.339
-<i> Establishment is dead!</i>

16:15.374 --> 16:17.641
<i>No one understands me!
Establishment is dead!</i>

16:17.676 --> 16:20.144
- Establishment is dead!
Establishment is dead!

16:20.179 --> 16:22.446
No one understands me!
Establishment is dead!

16:22.481 --> 16:23.814
- I didn't wanna have
to do this,

16:23.849 --> 16:25.483
but there's something
you need to see.

16:31.023 --> 16:32.623
- hello, teddy.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.658
This is the winner

16:33.692 --> 16:35.159
of the wayne innovation prize.

16:35.194 --> 16:36.694
This guy won?

16:36.729 --> 16:38.140
Okay, there's no way
somebody this good-looking

16:38.164 --> 16:39.741
could invent something
better than these.

16:39.765 --> 16:41.899
- No, he didn't invent something
better than those,

16:41.934 --> 16:43.634
he is the invention.

16:45.938 --> 16:48.739
- are you checking out
our robot?

16:48.774 --> 16:49.974
- It's not that cool.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.475
- Would you like me
to be cooler?

16:54.213 --> 16:56.091
I hear the strokes are playing
a secret show tonight

16:56.115 --> 16:58.349
in joaquin phoenix's backyard.

16:58.384 --> 17:00.885
- Oh, yeah, those mittens
are super dope too, bro.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.192
- teddy...

17:08.227 --> 17:10.428
Oh.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.377
- See, this is why
I didn't want to submit,

17:16.402 --> 17:18.702
but you went behind my back
and you did it anyway.

17:18.737 --> 17:20.671
- I was doing it for you.

17:20.705 --> 17:22.339
- No, you did it for you.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.907
You didn't like
that you were in charge

17:23.943 --> 17:25.776
of a division of nobodies.

17:25.810 --> 17:28.279
- Well, maybe we wouldn't
be a division of nobodies

17:28.314 --> 17:29.613
if we had less pouty babies

17:29.648 --> 17:31.615
and more people
like your brother.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.250
Went too far.
Already regret it.

17:38.324 --> 17:39.857
- get out of here.
Frostbite is...

17:47.566 --> 17:50.101
- wow, really puts things
in perspective.

17:50.136 --> 17:52.047
I can't even remember
what we were talking about.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.582
- Oh, you were saying that you
wished you'd hired my brother

17:53.606 --> 17:54.783
instead of me.
- Was that today?

17:54.807 --> 17:56.574
- Yeah.
- Oh.

18:02.181 --> 18:05.416
- oh, crap, the handle's frozen.

18:05.451 --> 18:06.417
Teddy....
- What?

18:06.452 --> 18:07.651
- Your gloves.

18:07.686 --> 18:09.553
We can use them
to unfreeze the handle.

18:09.588 --> 18:10.921
Yes!

18:10.956 --> 18:12.657
- or unfreeze crimson fox.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.127
- Yeah, here we go.
- Okay.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.075
Oh, my god, it's working.
- Of course it's working.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.732
I set it to deep fried turkey.
- Oh.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.903
You know, you were right.

18:25.938 --> 18:29.273
I entered the contest for me.
I'm sorry, teddy.

18:29.308 --> 18:30.941
I didn't bust my ass
my whole life

18:30.976 --> 18:34.111
to hear those wayne x dicks
tell me I'm a nobody.

18:34.146 --> 18:35.646
- Try being reminded
you're a nobody

18:35.681 --> 18:37.259
every single time
you talk to your parents.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.450
- Oh, trust me.
I know how hard it is

18:39.485 --> 18:41.152
to live in a sibling's shadow.

18:41.187 --> 18:42.653
- Oh, yeah,
what does your sister do?

18:42.688 --> 18:44.822
- She's a dog walker.

18:44.857 --> 18:47.158
I just know it's
really hard for her sometimes.

18:47.193 --> 18:48.993
- You don't know what it's like.

18:49.028 --> 18:51.095
You're my space-doctor brother,

18:51.130 --> 18:53.631
which makes me
your dog-walking little sister.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.834
- And she's a great person
who's capable of great things.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.602
Just like you.
- Right.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.048
I'm gonna be here my whole life
while my brother's

19:00.072 --> 19:01.850
performing open-heart surgery
at zero gravity.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.474
- Well, we'll both be here,

19:03.509 --> 19:05.109
and for what it's worth,

19:05.144 --> 19:06.544
I'm glad I'm here with you.

19:09.415 --> 19:12.149
Oops.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.822
- ooh, yeah.

19:21.393 --> 19:22.860
That was brutal.
- Sorry.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.395
Must have been very cold.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.230
- No, I meant listening
to that conversation.

19:26.265 --> 19:28.299
The gloves are cool though.
Can I have those?

19:28.334 --> 19:30.034
Yeah, I mean, you...

19:30.069 --> 19:32.369
You gonna use 'em to,
like, fight crime and stuff?

19:32.404 --> 19:34.905
- No, I'm gonna use them
to make popcorn.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.851
Of course I'm gonna use them
to fight crime, you dink.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.743
- Okay.

19:42.047 --> 19:43.314
- van?

19:43.349 --> 19:45.082
I want to apologize
for my outburst.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.651
- You embarrassed me
in front of dylan and her squad.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.520
- I'm sorry.
It's just that I learned that

19:49.555 --> 19:51.722
I can say no
and still be a nice person

19:51.757 --> 19:54.192
because I also need
to be nice to myself.

19:55.427 --> 19:58.095
- I'm sorry too.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.731
I'm used to bossing
servants around.

20:00.766 --> 20:03.534
They're who raised me.
My father was always working.

20:03.569 --> 20:05.069
He was too busy
to spend time with me

20:05.104 --> 20:08.706
or teach me how to build things.
- That's so sad.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.208
Except the cartoonish level
of opulence.

20:11.243 --> 20:14.178
- Yeah, that was pretty cool.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.047
The one thing I wanted
my entire childhood,

20:17.082 --> 20:19.550
it was a dream really,
was to build

20:19.585 --> 20:21.418
a tree house with my father.

20:21.453 --> 20:23.787
He promised,
but year after year,

20:23.822 --> 20:25.556
that dream was crushed.

20:25.591 --> 20:27.925
- Well, van, we're gonna
build you that tree house.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.893
- Oh, no,
I cannot let you do that.

20:29.928 --> 20:32.229
- No, no, no, you just
pick the tree, and it's yours.

20:32.264 --> 20:33.864
I'm gonna get started
on the blueprints.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.210
I'm gonna make your dreams
come true.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.067
- Thank you, ron!

20:37.102 --> 20:39.270
Whatever your last name is.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.907
Dylan.
Hey, I found somebody

20:43.942 --> 20:46.254
to build your stupid tree house.
Now you make good on our deal,

20:46.278 --> 20:50.080
and you let me and your mom have
a little bit of grown-up time.

20:50.115 --> 20:51.982
Yes, I'm talking about sex.

20:52.017 --> 20:53.717
<i>- With her modern take</i>

20:53.752 --> 20:56.253
<i>on a classic apple pie.</i>

20:56.288 --> 20:58.956
<i>Cold season is over.</i>

20:58.991 --> 21:01.458
Crimson fox defeated
several cold villains

21:01.493 --> 21:05.296
using what appears to be
a pair of super-heated gloves.

21:05.331 --> 21:07.164
- Hey, it's teddy's gloves.

21:07.199 --> 21:09.500
Looks like I brought teddy back.

21:09.535 --> 21:11.235
- I am a genius!

21:11.270 --> 21:14.772
Teddy-ted!

21:14.807 --> 21:17.641
Teddy-ted!

21:17.676 --> 21:19.176
- Yeah.

21:19.211 --> 21:21.312
He's gonna be real easy
to work with now.

21:23.682 --> 21:25.149
<i>That's funny.</i>
