WEBVTT

00:13.805 --> 00:15.182
Nice trousers, lads.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.850
-What?
-Expecting a flood?

00:39.873 --> 00:40.874
Oh, shit.

00:50.133 --> 00:53.762
Your mum's just lost her mother,
so let's just really be there for her.

00:53.846 --> 00:55.514
Yeah, well,
you only met my nan three times.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.100
The more you knew her,
the less sad it is, all right?

01:01.895 --> 01:03.897
Do you know they put
clotted cream on top of this?

01:03.981 --> 01:06.066
Yeah. But be careful though,
that stuff will kill ya.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.651
Well, I hope not.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.028
'Cause I'm bringing some back with me.

01:12.114 --> 01:13.866
God, it's so beautiful down here, Jase.

01:13.949 --> 01:17.077
Yeah, I know. Yeah, we spent a lot
of summers down here when I was a kid.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.538
Lot of memories down here.

01:19.621 --> 01:20.956
Hey. No way.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.291
-What?
-Is that--

01:23.041 --> 01:27.045
No way. Look there, do you see that? JR.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.799
A lot of memories.

01:33.886 --> 01:36.430
Okay. Well, should we crack on then?

01:36.513 --> 01:38.265
Unless you two wanna catch up.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.516
No, no.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.352
That's funny. Okay.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.024
That's funny.

02:03.999 --> 02:06.043
Why'd your gran move
all the way down here?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.336
Racism.

02:08.419 --> 02:11.006
She swore
she'd never leave the London house.

02:11.089 --> 02:14.218
She once had this motorway
diverted around it.

02:14.301 --> 02:18.722
She got 10,000 people to sign a petition.
She's chained herself to a tree, right?

02:18.805 --> 02:20.390
They've offered her an absolute fortune.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.100
-Yeah.
-Immovable, she was.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.395
Then a sweet Asian family
moves in next door,

02:25.479 --> 02:27.272
and she was down here like a greyhound.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.357
Oh, shit.

02:29.733 --> 02:30.734
Oh, shit, shit.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.240
-Hi.
-Hi.

02:37.449 --> 02:40.827
-How are you?
-Good. You?

02:40.911 --> 02:43.580
-Good, yeah. Yeah, you?
-Yeah, good.

02:44.331 --> 02:47.960
Just dropped off some flowers
from Mum.

02:49.503 --> 02:53.423
Nikki Newman. This is Sky. Sky Jones.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.968
All right. Why you full-naming us?

02:56.051 --> 02:57.219
-Hello.
-Hi.

02:59.054 --> 03:00.681
So sorry about...

03:00.764 --> 03:03.350
-Oh, no, it's all right. She was awful.
-Yeah, she was.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.561
She was ours though.

03:05.644 --> 03:06.979
-Yeah.
-She...

03:07.062 --> 03:09.857
Are you gonna come
to the memorial at the beach?

03:09.940 --> 03:13.277
-Yeah. Yeah, it's important for Mum.
-Yeah.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.320
-I'm gonna go.
-Okay. All right, yeah, yeah.

03:15.404 --> 03:16.446
All right, then, see you later.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.573
-See ya.
-Bye.

03:18.282 --> 03:19.575
Nice to--

03:20.951 --> 03:22.828
-Come on.
-That was an odd conversation.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.496
No, it wasn't. It's good.
Good conversation.

03:24.580 --> 03:25.873
-Are you joking me?
-What?

03:25.956 --> 03:29.042
It was like you were stuck down a foxhole,
and you were radioing back to base.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.378
"Good, yeah. Fine, yeah.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.381
-Over." Who was she?
-No one. Just someone I used to know.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.591
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

03:35.674 --> 03:36.884
Sky Jones?

03:36.967 --> 03:38.135
-Oh, okay.
-What?

03:38.886 --> 03:41.054
-Was that the SJ from the pole?
-Maybe.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.807
Why was she being weird, Jase?
Did you treat her badly?

03:43.891 --> 03:45.642
-Did you break up with her?
-No, no.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.227
We're still together.

03:48.854 --> 03:52.441
Remember, don't leave me alone with
your auntie. I never know what to say.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.985
Talk about how expensive things are
in London. They love all that.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.528
-Here he is.
-Hello.

03:56.612 --> 03:58.488
-Hello, mate.
-Hi.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.573
How are you?

04:00.449 --> 04:01.617
Hello.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.578
-Go on, in you go, in you go.
-Thank you.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.205
-They're all in there.
-Okay.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.169
-Hi, Mum. You all right?
-Jason.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.462
Hello, Janet.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.005
Hi, you two.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.507
Hello, hello.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.470
How we doing, Sandra?

04:21.553 --> 04:22.804
What?

04:22.888 --> 04:25.849
I dunno. Just one of them, isn't it?

04:26.808 --> 04:30.771
Right. Yeah, I suppose that--
that's a good way to think about it.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.315
I'm so sorry for your loss, Janet.

04:33.398 --> 04:36.443
It was three days ago,
so it's very much water under the bridge.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.905
Right. Yeah.

04:40.489 --> 04:44.159
Fact of life.
Comes for everyone. Friends, family.

04:44.243 --> 04:45.911
All the best ones from the Beatles.

04:46.703 --> 04:50.624
I suppose the Pythons are dying roughly
in the order I'd hoped, so.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.377
Everything's just bloody well
falling apart.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.796
Do you know,
when it feels like that, Sandra,

04:55.879 --> 04:59.842
I find it really useful to explore
positive affirmations.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.760
The shed's falling down, Nikki.

05:02.553 --> 05:05.889
Maybe you could pop out
and positively affirm it back up again.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.975
Right.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.226
Yeah.

05:13.063 --> 05:16.567
How many "No junk mail" stickers
does she have to put up?

05:16.650 --> 05:19.111
She hated junk mail!

05:22.072 --> 05:23.365
No, this is not right.

05:24.116 --> 05:27.286
Oh, no, it's fine. It's just that
limestone makes it taste a bit funny.

05:34.084 --> 05:38.088
I should probably mention that I think
that Emmy's got a bit of a crush on me.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.591
It's sort of developed over the last
few years. It's not a big deal.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.218
She's at that age, you know,
and I'm the hot cousin, so.

05:43.302 --> 05:45.220
All right. Are you sure?

05:45.304 --> 05:46.930
Trust me. A man knows.

05:56.607 --> 05:59.526
Straight women
don't look at each other like that, Jason.

05:59.610 --> 06:00.861
Unless they're in prison.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.822
Bloody hell, Nikki. Not every young person
is a lesbian, you know.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.492
-I feel like your mum's so angry.
-Emmy!

06:07.576 --> 06:10.704
I feel like she never gets a single moment
of calmness or peace.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.247
But she's adapted to it though.

06:12.331 --> 06:14.917
She's like one of those people that live
on a mountain that don't need much oxygen.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.002
Her mum's died. She--

06:18.253 --> 06:20.214
She needs to engage her feelings a bit.

06:20.714 --> 06:21.965
Please don't break my mum.

06:22.049 --> 06:25.177
No, it's-- It's fine. It's a process.

06:25.260 --> 06:28.972
We break her down, deal with everything
and then put her back together again.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.475
I suppose we are only here for two days.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.143
No, no, no. It'll be fine.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.358
Hi, Sandra.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.278
Do you have a moment?

06:47.407 --> 06:49.785
I thought it might be nice...

06:49.868 --> 06:53.413
for you to take a moment
just to breathe with me.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.589
Sometimes when everything's a bit hectic,

07:02.673 --> 07:07.511
it's so important to carve out some time
to simply breathe.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.723
I just fit breathing into my day, Nikki.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.441
-All cured?
-No.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.616
Don't you wanna know
what's underneath all that anger?

07:29.700 --> 07:32.744
No, I'm pretty sure it's just anger,
all the way down.

07:32.828 --> 07:35.205
Anger is such a pointless emotion.
There's something else going on.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.958
-I don't think there is.
-There must be. Her mum just died.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.919
-Yeah, but she was a hateful old racist.
-It doesn't matter.

07:41.003 --> 07:42.212
Well, it takes the edge off, doesn't it?

07:42.296 --> 07:43.755
Your family's just weird.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.299
Yeah, but they're normal weird
though, aren't they?

07:45.382 --> 07:46.633
Can we get the bill, please? Thank you.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.719
They're not, like,
"check the hard drive" weird.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.262
-Oh, my God.
-What?

07:50.345 --> 07:51.972
Is that why they call her Sky?

07:52.055 --> 07:54.224
-Because she's bloody everywhere.
-Where is she?

07:54.308 --> 07:57.019
Yeah. How funny.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.439
I looked her up. She's an artist.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.232
No, I think she just sells
old bits of driftwood.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.651
Yeah, no, that's art down here.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.403
I've always wanted to do arty stuff.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.530
Look, anyone can be a bohemian here.

08:08.614 --> 08:10.490
You've only gotta sell
one bamboo soap dish a week.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.159
They'd all be homeless in London.

08:12.618 --> 08:14.494
-Will you stop? Please.
-What?

08:14.578 --> 08:18.123
Look, it was 15-odd years ago, okay?

08:18.207 --> 08:20.667
Aren't we past the stage
of being jealous of each other's exes?

08:20.751 --> 08:21.835
-I'm not--
-Listen.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.170
Your ex is still on our car insurance.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.923
Yeah, only 'cause when I take him off,
it goes up.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.846
-What?
-That kid really looks like you.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.224
-Which one?
-The one with the big head.

08:35.307 --> 08:36.475
There you go, sir.

08:36.558 --> 08:37.851
-Thank you.
-Ta, thanks.

08:41.395 --> 08:44.399
Happy Birthday to you

08:44.775 --> 08:46.485
When did you say you two were together?

08:47.069 --> 08:48.153
Like, 15 year...

08:48.237 --> 08:51.740
Happy Birthday, dear Tristan

08:51.823 --> 08:54.868
-Happy Birthday to you
-Years ago.

08:57.412 --> 09:02.334
"Out of the shadows steps Frank Carter,
52 and looking it.

09:02.417 --> 09:07.756
A hard-boiled, half glass of scotch
with an emptiness in his eyes.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.093
A void, a gap, something unsaid.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.054
He'll knock a man down,
but he'll help him up.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.598
That's his code. That's his word.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.143
He stands next to a woman, 28, attractive.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.938
He knew they'd sent her to kill him.

09:23.021 --> 09:26.024
But as the lonely rain
beat down on their faces,

09:26.108 --> 09:31.154
he realized maybe, just maybe,
she was gonna save him too."

09:35.951 --> 09:38.203
How can rain be lonely?

09:38.912 --> 09:42.624
And why is it always raining in books
and films when people fall in love?

09:42.708 --> 09:44.626
I mean, that's not real life, is it?

09:45.127 --> 09:47.546
Okay, that-- Your tone, right there,

09:47.629 --> 09:50.132
that's making me shrink slightly,
creatively.

09:50.215 --> 09:53.719
I just think that you need to write
about something more personal.

09:54.803 --> 09:55.804
Right.

09:56.138 --> 09:59.391
And, you know,
writers need to know how to take feedback.

09:59.474 --> 10:02.311
Let's just scooch on over
to the end there,

10:02.394 --> 10:04.396
'cause it does--
it really does gather pace.

10:04.479 --> 10:07.608
Great. And maybe we can do
a bit wedding prep before we have dinner.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.151
But you're gonna
need the context, aren't you?

10:09.234 --> 10:10.861
'Cause you're not gonna underst--

10:10.944 --> 10:15.532
Okay, let's just take it from the top
and really try and listen this time.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.035
-Yeah, all right then.
-Okay.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.998
"Out of the shadows steps Frank Carter..."

10:26.460 --> 10:27.753
I'm listening.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.047
He doesn't look like me.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.592
Are you kidding me?
Did you see his massive head?

10:33.675 --> 10:35.260
Yeah,
I'm sure the dates don't match, okay?

10:35.344 --> 10:38.222
-Anyway, his head wasn't even that big.
-Are you serious?

10:38.305 --> 10:41.433
He looked like an Easter Island statue.
I'm surprised he didn't topple over.

10:41.517 --> 10:43.060
All kids have got big heads, haven't they?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.270
That's why they get their jumpers stuck
putting 'em on.

10:45.354 --> 10:47.648
My mum used to have to
cut the collars down on mine.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.316
Well, it's hardly a DNA test, is it?

10:49.399 --> 10:50.692
You don't go to the doctor's and he says,

10:50.776 --> 10:52.819
"Well, yeah, I mean, he's got a big head.
That's close enough."

10:52.903 --> 10:55.239
Jase, are we gonna have to move down here?
I don't know anyone down here.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.573
Yeah, you do. You know Sky,

10:56.657 --> 10:59.076
you know the kid with the big head
who might be my child.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.911
-Are you taking this seriously?
-Not totally, no.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.621
Can we just--
Can we just take a breath here.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.665
You see one kid with a big head
and slightly curly hair,

11:04.748 --> 11:06.792
now suddenly
we're putting offers in on houses?

11:06.875 --> 11:08.669
And anyway, I'm...

11:10.003 --> 11:12.339
relatively sure the dates don't match.

11:13.465 --> 11:14.716
Come on.

11:35.529 --> 11:36.530
Oh, God.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.744
Are you hiding?

11:43.912 --> 11:46.415
There's a woman showing off her baby
like it's a bloody Grammy,

11:46.498 --> 11:48.000
so I'm taking a break.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.627
-You're Miss Newman.
-Yeah.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.963
I'm Deven. Raina's dad.

11:54.006 --> 11:55.340
Raina.

11:55.883 --> 11:56.884
Raina with the socks.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.511
Yeah. I'm working on that.

12:00.888 --> 12:01.972
She's a big fan.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.642
Well, that's lucky. Most of them hate me.

12:06.560 --> 12:10.355
Nah, you're just straight with them.
It's better in the long run.

12:11.148 --> 12:12.316
Maybe.

12:13.025 --> 12:16.445
Not all teachers are like
Michelle Pfeiffer in Dangerous Minds.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.906
Some of us are just doing it
for the 12 weeks holiday.

12:20.616 --> 12:21.617
You're funny.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.579
What? You don't know you're funny?

12:26.914 --> 12:29.666
I never know what to do with compliments.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.920
Well, keep 'em close to your heart.

12:38.967 --> 12:42.387
See you again, Miss Newman. I hope.

13:15.087 --> 13:16.839
I don't know why we're doing this.

13:16.922 --> 13:19.758
She didn't want a church, she wanted
a cremating. She said that.

13:21.009 --> 13:24.054
Has she not got any tea?
I mean, she must have tea.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.347
We'll go get some.

13:25.430 --> 13:28.183
No, I want you to clear the shed with me.

13:28.267 --> 13:30.018
It's not going up again,
so it's coming down.

13:30.102 --> 13:33.814
It's okay, here we go. Lots.

13:33.897 --> 13:34.898
Janet.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.485
Can you remember
when I was last here for the summer?

13:38.569 --> 13:41.655
-When was it, 18, 19 years ago?
-Yeah, about then.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.116
Yeah. There you go. Thank you.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.785
No, I tell a lie.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.996
It was the year we lost the dog.

13:49.079 --> 13:52.583
Sixteen years and a bit. Almost 17.

13:55.586 --> 13:59.131
Oh, God. You wanna adopt a teenager?

14:29.244 --> 14:30.829
Come on!

14:31.955 --> 14:35.292
Oh, my Lord. Worse than I thought.

14:38.754 --> 14:42.508
Look, Nikki, this doesn't prove anything.

14:42.591 --> 14:48.347
-If that's my son, then--
-Princess has a brother.

14:49.515 --> 14:51.517
What? Why didn't they tell us?

14:51.600 --> 14:52.851
They just have.

14:53.852 --> 14:55.604
That was her brother in the video.

14:55.687 --> 14:56.730
-What?
-Yeah.

14:58.607 --> 15:01.985
There's no one who can take both,
so they've got to separate them.

15:04.196 --> 15:06.073
Princess has a brother.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.409
Look at them, Jase.
How can they separate them?

15:09.493 --> 15:11.203
Well, they've got no choice,
I suppose. They--

15:11.286 --> 15:14.998
No. No-- No, that's not-- It's not right.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.416
That's just-- I'm sorry, that's--

15:16.500 --> 15:18.710
It's just not right
that that has to happen.

15:18.794 --> 15:21.922
I'd be devastated if they tried
to separate me and Karen.

15:22.005 --> 15:24.758
And that's Karen.
I didn't even like her till I was 31.

15:24.842 --> 15:27.344
Well, we can help her, can't we?
That's part of our job.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.596
No, it's just, it's not-- It's not fair!

15:30.430 --> 15:32.474
So many things are not fair!

15:32.558 --> 15:36.645
Honestly, Jase, people, they need
to start looking into all the unfairness.

15:36.728 --> 15:41.149
Because, truthfully, there are people just
going along trying to be a good person,

15:41.233 --> 15:44.945
enjoying some really nice ice cream,
and then God just thinks,

15:45.028 --> 15:47.823
"She looks like
she's finally feeling happy.

15:47.906 --> 15:51.118
Let's just throw a big-headed boy at her.
Let's really mess that up."

15:51.201 --> 15:54.454
"Does that nine-year-old girl
only have one person

15:54.538 --> 15:56.248
in the whole entire world
that she can trust?

15:56.331 --> 15:58.750
Well, then let's just take him
away from her then."

15:58.834 --> 16:00.961
And now some people have
more boys than they need,

16:01.044 --> 16:03.881
and others just do not have enough,
and how is that fair?

16:05.507 --> 16:08.760
-Okay, quite a lot to unpack there.
-"It's not," is the answer!

16:08.844 --> 16:13.932
It sucks! It just sucks, and I'm--
I'm sick of it!

16:16.018 --> 16:16.852
God.

16:17.603 --> 16:19.438
I'm really sorry we have to do this.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.066
Hey. Nikki.

16:27.863 --> 16:30.282
-What you doing?
-Nikki!

16:34.494 --> 16:37.206
Why is everything so hard?

16:48.467 --> 16:51.595
-I'm-- I'm sorr-- I'm sorry.
-It's all right.

16:56.016 --> 17:00.020
Why did you die before I rang you back?

17:03.607 --> 17:05.150
The system!

17:06.193 --> 17:07.944
Just generally!

17:08.028 --> 17:10.781
But I know everyone's doing their best!

17:11.615 --> 17:15.285
-Bloody cancer!
-Sandra? Love?

17:15.368 --> 17:17.871
People that say, "prosecco o'clock"!

17:20.290 --> 17:23.042
Talking about your grandchildren

17:23.126 --> 17:25.963
around people who don't have any at all!

17:28.924 --> 17:32.302
Naturally... wavy...

17:33.053 --> 17:37.724
blonde-haired... bitches!

17:37.808 --> 17:39.726
I don't wanna die!

18:09.631 --> 18:11.258
I'm just gonna...

18:17.055 --> 18:18.515
Saves you a job, doesn't it?

18:19.057 --> 18:20.934
Why do you think you're...

18:22.394 --> 18:24.980
She's gone, and I'm next.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.901
It's getting late, and what have I done?

18:28.984 --> 18:31.278
God, you've done-- You've done loads.

18:32.654 --> 18:33.822
Do you know...

18:34.865 --> 18:38.785
I was 70 before I tried proper
dark chocolate.

18:40.162 --> 18:44.041
-It was so... bittersweet.
-I know. It's horrible.

18:44.124 --> 18:47.878
Because I thought of all the years
I've wasted not eating it.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.798
I see. Yeah.

18:54.218 --> 18:56.261
I wanna do something
I've never done before.

18:56.345 --> 18:57.429
Yeah?

18:57.513 --> 18:58.514
I wanna...

18:59.598 --> 19:00.682
go to Yemen.

19:03.393 --> 19:07.064
Okay. Yeah, you could go to Yemen.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.650
-Can I?
-Yeah.

19:11.109 --> 19:13.987
Or somewhere else.
Maybe somewhere with a beach.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.198
Or a government.

19:18.534 --> 19:19.952
You can do whatever you want.

19:22.955 --> 19:23.956
Thank you.

19:29.628 --> 19:31.338
She did want cremating.

19:32.923 --> 19:34.883
People ignore you when you're old.

19:34.967 --> 19:36.301
Sandra.

19:39.054 --> 19:43.100
There is not a single chance in hell
that people could ever ignore you.

20:01.243 --> 20:04.037
Why you picking up the junk mail?
What you doing?

20:06.373 --> 20:07.708
I'm not ignoring her.

20:14.173 --> 20:15.465
You all right, Rambo?

20:16.008 --> 20:18.135
-Yeah, I think so.
-Yeah?

20:18.218 --> 20:20.012
Just took some anger out on the shed.

20:20.095 --> 20:22.181
-It's all right. I'm a bit scared though.
-Why?

20:22.264 --> 20:23.682
Well, we haven't got a shed.

20:26.435 --> 20:28.145
What if it changes things?

20:28.228 --> 20:29.229
It won't.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.818
What if you have a son and you realize
that you don't need any more kids?

20:34.902 --> 20:37.863
I don't think children work like that.
I don't think they fill your heart up.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.323
I think they actually
make your heart bigger

20:39.406 --> 20:41.158
so that you've got
more room for stuff, so...

20:42.326 --> 20:45.329
I don't wanna feel alone, 'cause,
you know, you'd have done it all before.

20:45.412 --> 20:48.248
The thing that we're both trying to do
together, you'd have already done.

20:48.332 --> 20:50.834
I haven't done anything.
He's 16 years old.

20:50.918 --> 20:52.669
I've missed all the good bits.

20:52.753 --> 20:55.172
Bit like turning up to a McCartney concert
where he's done "Hey, Jude,"

20:55.255 --> 20:56.965
now he's on to Frog Chorus.

20:58.717 --> 21:01.345
Look, whatever happens...

21:03.222 --> 21:05.057
we'll be messing things up together.

21:06.850 --> 21:07.851
All right?

21:10.771 --> 21:11.813
Come on.

21:13.732 --> 21:17.027
If we can't cremate her,
at least we can cremate her junk mail.

21:19.571 --> 21:23.825
Well, if it's a memorial,
we should say something nice about Gran.

21:23.909 --> 21:26.119
-All of us?
-Yes.

21:31.416 --> 21:32.918
Anyone wanna start?

21:35.921 --> 21:37.923
-Jase.
-No, I'm racking my--

21:40.342 --> 21:42.886
No one took clothes
back to a shop better than Nan, did they?

21:42.970 --> 21:45.639
Do you remember? No receipt, no problem.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.308
Honestly, it was a superpower, Rakhi.

21:50.185 --> 21:52.855
She'd never go to bed
till we rang to say we was home safe.

21:52.938 --> 21:54.189
Yeah.

21:54.273 --> 21:58.110
We used to ring from Swindon
so she could get an early night.

21:58.819 --> 22:00.445
Do you remember the hat?

22:01.321 --> 22:04.658
She didn't trust CCTV, so when
she went to London, she wore a big hat.

22:04.741 --> 22:07.077
Very incognito.
An 80-year-old in a sombrero.

22:09.413 --> 22:11.248
She was a tough old bird.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.920
Buried two husbands, three sisters
and a couple of cats.

22:19.089 --> 22:20.799
And a lot of feelings.

22:22.134 --> 22:23.260
Yeah.

22:24.595 --> 22:26.680
The cats weren't hers, to be fair, but...

22:31.810 --> 22:33.103
Come on, scatter the ashes.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.316
Right in the fire.

22:39.693 --> 22:41.695
-We love you, Gran.
-See ya, Nan.

22:41.778 --> 22:43.113
Rest in peace.

22:46.408 --> 22:48.076
Look at this.

22:56.793 --> 22:57.920
You okay?

23:06.803 --> 23:07.846
Go.

23:08.639 --> 23:09.640
Yeah?

23:10.098 --> 23:11.099
Yeah.

23:12.559 --> 23:15.354
Listen, if your mum can go to Yemen,
I can cope with whatever.

23:15.437 --> 23:16.730
Okay.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.774
-Who's going to Yemen?
-Just go.

23:23.820 --> 23:27.324
-Go look for your granddad, all right?
-Yeah, all right.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.867
-Hiya.
-Hi.

23:28.951 --> 23:30.285
-You all right?
-Yeah.

23:32.329 --> 23:33.497
Yeah. You all right?

23:33.580 --> 23:35.874
-How are you?
-Yeah, good. Good, you?

23:35.958 --> 23:37.417
Good. Thanks for coming.

23:37.501 --> 23:39.002
-No worry.
-Listen...

23:43.131 --> 23:45.551
I fancy some wine.

23:45.634 --> 23:47.636
Do you fancy doing a bit of a run?

23:47.719 --> 23:49.012
-Yeah.
-Yeah, totally.

23:49.096 --> 23:52.558
Yeah? Okay. I need to write it down.

23:52.641 --> 23:54.309
Janet, have you got a pen?

23:54.393 --> 23:58.230
I'm a bit fussy when it comes to wine.
You might need to go to a few places.

23:58.313 --> 24:00.065
-Gotcha, that's totally fine.
-Yeah, definitely.

24:00.148 --> 24:02.484
Yeah? All right. So...

24:03.235 --> 24:05.529
There's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

24:06.321 --> 24:07.447
Yeah, me too.

24:10.784 --> 24:13.745
-Cool. Thank you.
-Come on, let's go.

24:24.256 --> 24:28.010
Had a medium glass of red wine
in Leicester Square last week.

24:28.093 --> 24:29.928
Cost me nine pounds, 20.

24:33.390 --> 24:35.142
"Have fun"?

24:35.225 --> 24:36.268
Nice one, Nikki.

24:41.231 --> 24:42.941
Freedom.

24:43.025 --> 24:47.237
It's just that... he does
have quite a big head, doesn't he?

24:47.321 --> 24:51.116
And we were together at the time,
so the dates match.

24:52.409 --> 24:54.077
Yeah, they do.

24:55.537 --> 24:58.332
I probably should have told you
at the time--

24:58.415 --> 24:59.583
All right.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.251
But...

25:04.963 --> 25:06.173
I cheated on you.

25:07.883 --> 25:10.052
-What?
-A lot.

25:12.221 --> 25:13.263
With who?

25:13.347 --> 25:15.140
-Have you met Brian?
-No.

25:16.975 --> 25:18.810
-Hey, son. Good to see you, mate.
-Yeah.

25:18.894 --> 25:20.395
No, yeah, he comes and goes.

25:23.106 --> 25:24.107
Okay.

25:24.191 --> 25:25.400
I'm so sorry.

25:25.484 --> 25:26.860
It's-- It--

25:27.778 --> 25:28.779
It's fine.

25:31.740 --> 25:33.367
-So--
-Nice to see ya.

25:34.618 --> 25:37.538
-And you.
-Let's do it!

25:37.621 --> 25:40.457
It's cold. It's so cold!

25:41.250 --> 25:43.460
-You're not gonna come in, dear?
-You not gonna come in, Vic?

25:43.544 --> 25:45.546
-No? Don't fancy that?
-Come on, Jan!

25:48.215 --> 25:51.760
-She won't. She is. She is!
-Is she? Is she?

25:51.844 --> 25:55.806
-Come on, Janet! It's really nice.
-Go on! Yay!

25:56.682 --> 25:59.017
Hey, mate, hold these a sec,
will you? Lovely.

26:00.060 --> 26:01.228
I wet me knickers.

26:01.311 --> 26:03.146
Look at you. Look at you.

26:03.230 --> 26:04.731
I swear this seaweed is after me!

26:08.610 --> 26:11.029
Just had a chat with her...

26:12.698 --> 26:13.699
His was even bigger.

26:32.342 --> 26:34.595
-All right.
-Well, there you go.

26:34.678 --> 26:35.679
And this.

26:51.111 --> 26:52.112
Look.

26:55.616 --> 26:56.658
See?

26:57.451 --> 26:58.660
All right, fair play.

27:05.918 --> 27:07.044
All right.

27:24.937 --> 27:26.772
Can you just stop here for a sec?

27:27.564 --> 27:28.899
Nikki, where are you going?

27:33.362 --> 27:34.655
What's she doing?
