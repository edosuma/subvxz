[instrumental music]

00:58.841 --> 01:00.451
Hey.

01:00.495 --> 01:02.062
Nice, Mrs. M.

01:02.105 --> 01:03.759
You're gonna be so ripped.

01:03.802 --> 01:06.501
Not exactly the look
I'm going for.

01:06.544 --> 01:08.242
Maybe it's time
for a break then.

01:08.285 --> 01:10.113
Maybe you make
some fresh lemonade.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.202
Serve a glass
to your daughter's best friend.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.377
Nice try, Taylor.

01:13.421 --> 01:14.422
I wanna get this finished before

01:14.465 --> 01:15.727
Brooke's dad brings her home.

01:15.771 --> 01:16.772
Why don't you just hire someone?

01:16.815 --> 01:18.208
Hey, my mom has a cute gardener.

01:18.252 --> 01:19.731
I can get you his number.

01:19.775 --> 01:22.386
I love working in my garden.
Keeps me sane.

01:22.430 --> 01:23.779
You know, when my mom
got divorced

01:23.822 --> 01:24.997
she didn't leave
the house for three months.

01:25.041 --> 01:26.869
You seem to be handling it
a lot better.

01:26.912 --> 01:28.175
Thank you.

01:28.218 --> 01:29.741
[engine revving]

01:29.785 --> 01:31.874
They're here.

01:31.917 --> 01:34.094
- Mom.
- Oh, Brooke.

01:35.138 --> 01:36.618
Ah, baby.

01:37.749 --> 01:40.100
You look different. Older.

01:40.143 --> 01:42.754
- It's only been a month.
- No, your mom's right.

01:42.798 --> 01:44.756
You're like this whole
woman of the world now.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.410
'Looks good on you.'

01:46.454 --> 01:48.325
Who's that in the car?

01:48.369 --> 01:51.023
Oh, that's Tiffany. I can't
wait for you to meet her.

01:51.067 --> 01:52.895
- Tiffany?
- Okay. Nobody move.

01:52.938 --> 01:54.201
I'll be back in a second.

01:54.244 --> 01:56.551
I've had to pee
since baggage claim.

01:56.594 --> 01:57.900
'It's so good to be home.'

02:04.211 --> 02:06.517
Oh, there's some..

02:06.561 --> 02:11.435
Your royal highness'
not quite so matched luggage.

02:11.479 --> 02:15.222
Our daughter managed
to shop herself into needing

02:15.265 --> 02:16.701
an extra suitcase.

02:16.745 --> 02:17.789
That sounds like her.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.008
Well, it's not every day

02:19.051 --> 02:20.705
that you get to
go shopping in Paris

02:20.749 --> 02:22.751
using your dad's
credit card, right?

02:24.318 --> 02:27.886
I'm sorry,
I-I don't think we've met.

02:27.930 --> 02:30.411
Uh, yes, Jackie,
this is, uh, Tiffany.

02:30.454 --> 02:32.195
Jackie, it is so nice
to finally meet you.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.763
I have heard so many
wonderful things about you.

02:34.806 --> 02:36.591
Hmm.

02:36.634 --> 02:39.637
I-I wish I could say the same.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.291
I didn't even know
you were dating.

02:42.292 --> 02:43.989
We're not anymore.

02:46.122 --> 02:48.472
Whoa.

02:48.516 --> 02:52.172
Taylor, if you could go inside
and check on Brooke, please.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.961
I... I'm sorry.
This is, this is a lot.

02:59.004 --> 03:01.006
It all happened superfast

03:01.050 --> 03:05.185
and I don't know,
it just felt so, uh, right.

03:08.884 --> 03:11.191
Okay. Well, I will leave
you two to catch up.

03:11.234 --> 03:12.235
I'll just go say bye to Brooke.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.541
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:17.893 --> 03:20.025
- Nice hat.
- Jackie.

03:20.069 --> 03:22.463
Let's just talk
about this for a second.

03:24.291 --> 03:27.294
I mean... you're married?

03:28.904 --> 03:31.515
Okay, we had been dating
for a little bit.

03:31.559 --> 03:34.518
Tiffany surprised us
in Europe and..

03:35.258 --> 03:37.086
What?

03:37.129 --> 03:39.567
No, it's just a lot
to show up here and dump on me.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.177
This is the first time
I've seen you since it happened.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.657
I-I'm not gonna call you
on the phone.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.094
Okay.

03:45.137 --> 03:46.835
Actually thought you might be
happy for me.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.446
I am.

03:49.490 --> 03:50.795
I am.

03:50.839 --> 03:54.408
I'm just very surprised,
that's all.

03:54.451 --> 03:56.671
My love life isn't exactly
your business anymore.

03:56.714 --> 03:59.935
Well, it is actually,
when it affects our daughter.

03:59.978 --> 04:02.024
I mean, you know how
she reacted when we split up.

04:02.067 --> 04:04.113
Is she ready for this?

04:04.156 --> 04:06.071
[laughter]

04:08.030 --> 04:10.815
- Seems to be.
- 'Oh, mom, you met Tiffany?'

04:10.859 --> 04:12.904
You have to see this picture
from our trip.

04:12.948 --> 04:15.080
The guide on our river tour,
he thought we were sisters.

04:15.124 --> 04:16.647
'Can you believe it?'

04:16.690 --> 04:17.995
Somehow I can.

04:19.649 --> 04:21.783
Okay, sorry to break up
the party here

04:21.826 --> 04:23.567
'but let's let Brooke
get settled.'

04:23.611 --> 04:25.656
Uh, these ladies have some
catching up to do so.

04:26.440 --> 04:27.963
Bye, baby.

04:29.225 --> 04:30.400
Uh, one second..

04:30.444 --> 04:32.924
Uh, Jackie, um..

04:32.968 --> 04:35.405
I know that we didn't do
this perfectly

04:35.449 --> 04:38.278
and I don't want to be pushy,
but we would really love it

04:38.321 --> 04:41.672
if you and Brooke would come
to dinner this week.

04:41.716 --> 04:43.500
It would mean the world to us
if we could all get along.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.763
I mean, for Brooke's sake,
if nothing else.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.290
How's Friday?

04:50.333 --> 04:52.030
Friday is perfect.

05:01.344 --> 05:04.042
Oh, mom, you have to see
the bridesmaid's dress

05:04.086 --> 05:05.348
I wore for dad's wedding.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.698
I think it's in here.

05:09.178 --> 05:10.919
It's couture.

05:10.962 --> 05:12.442
Tiffany helped me pick it out.

05:12.486 --> 05:14.314
I was her maid of honor.
Isn't that amazing?

05:14.357 --> 05:15.532
Wow. Yes.

05:15.576 --> 05:17.839
Uh, I mean, look at all of this.

05:17.882 --> 05:20.581
Did you leave any clothes
for the other shoppers?

05:20.624 --> 05:24.324
Okay. There's plenty on the
Champs Elysees to go around.

05:26.064 --> 05:29.633
Speaking of shopping,
I got you something.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.897
I love it.

05:32.941 --> 05:35.030
Is the doll sold separately?

05:36.510 --> 05:38.512
Tiffany said I should buy it.

05:38.555 --> 05:40.252
I said it was a little small.

05:43.734 --> 05:46.041
[instrumental music]

05:46.084 --> 05:47.956
It's for your business cards.

05:47.999 --> 05:49.740
'You know,
open houses and stuff.'

05:49.784 --> 05:51.916
Baby.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.005
I love it.
That is so thoughtful.

05:54.702 --> 05:55.964
Thank you.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.402
So what else did you do
in Paris?

05:59.446 --> 06:01.012
How did you like
the Sacre Coeur?

06:01.056 --> 06:05.060
Oh, well, we didn't quite
make it there.

06:05.103 --> 06:07.454
What? But you were so
looking forward to it.

06:07.497 --> 06:10.979
I was, but Tiffany totally
hooked us up with these events

06:11.022 --> 06:12.328
for up and coming designers.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.549
'We kind of ran out of time.'

06:15.592 --> 06:17.681
We saw a lot of other stuff
in the city.

06:17.725 --> 06:21.293
- We saw the Eiffel Tower..
- Alright, alright.

06:21.337 --> 06:24.601
Well, I'm glad you were able to
fit in some culture

06:24.645 --> 06:26.951
between your shopping
and your parties.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.214
You know, Tiffany says
that fashion is art.

06:31.129 --> 06:33.088
How long has your dad
been seeing her?

06:33.131 --> 06:34.916
I don't know.
A while, I guess.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.788
She seems young.

06:37.832 --> 06:40.095
Yeah. She's so much fun.

06:40.138 --> 06:41.749
We had dinner at this bistro
on the Left Bank

06:41.792 --> 06:43.228
and she knew the chef there.

06:43.272 --> 06:45.622
He invited us into the kitchen
and everything.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.581
Wow. Fancy.

06:47.624 --> 06:48.799
Yeah.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.544
What's wrong?

06:55.719 --> 06:56.851
Nothing.

06:57.808 --> 06:59.201
Nothing. Nothing.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.595
I'm just so glad you're home.

07:02.596 --> 07:04.119
I missed you so much.

07:14.521 --> 07:15.478
Did you get your sandwich?

07:15.522 --> 07:17.045
I left it in the fridge.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.742
I don't want the carbs.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.178
Tiffany and I are doing paleo.

07:20.222 --> 07:22.137
Gotta detox
from all the rich foods.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.443
Alright, well..

07:25.227 --> 07:26.881
I have some cash
if you wanna buy lunch.

07:26.924 --> 07:30.101
- I'm fine. I have some carrots.
- Honey, that's not enough.

07:30.145 --> 07:32.060
Mom, we have to go.
I'm gonna be late for school.

07:32.103 --> 07:33.583
One second.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.498
You know, if I had a car

07:35.542 --> 07:37.457
we wouldn't have
to rush around every morning.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.328
There's always the bus.

07:39.371 --> 07:40.982
Mom, no.

07:42.331 --> 07:43.550
You know my birthday
is coming up.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.900
And a car would make
a great present.

07:45.943 --> 07:49.817
Oh, honey, the market
is still recovering

07:49.860 --> 07:52.036
and, you know,
I need to watch our budget.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.082
- You could take dad's alimony.
- Brooke.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.518
He can at least help
with the car.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.826
Is this really about the money?

07:58.869 --> 08:00.741
I mean, I know I screwed up,
but that was over a year ago.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.396
Let's just talk about this
tonight. Okay, sweetie?

08:04.440 --> 08:06.050
Come on. Let's go.
We're late.

08:06.094 --> 08:07.922
That's what I've been saying.

08:11.839 --> 08:14.668
[Taylor]
'So, um, how did
the car convo go?'

08:14.711 --> 08:16.321
Well, she didn't say no.

08:16.365 --> 08:18.106
Sounds promising.

08:18.149 --> 08:19.324
Hmm.

08:21.631 --> 08:23.285
So, what are your plans
for your birthday?

08:23.328 --> 08:24.678
Waking up to find
a new convertible

08:24.721 --> 08:26.593
with a giant red bow
in the driveway.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.203
Yeah.

08:28.246 --> 08:30.292
So, what's plan B?

08:30.335 --> 08:31.641
Cake and disappointment.

08:34.991 --> 08:37.908
[instrumental music]

08:41.695 --> 08:44.480
I thought you were over
that hunky jock face.

08:45.437 --> 08:47.352
I'm just looking.

08:51.313 --> 08:52.880
Uh, a-are you seeing this?

08:52.923 --> 08:54.098
Yeah.

08:56.579 --> 08:57.928
'But he doesn't.'

08:57.972 --> 08:59.843
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi.

09:04.152 --> 09:05.893
[bell ringing]

09:07.111 --> 09:08.504
Come on, let's go.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.248
[instrumental music]

09:24.651 --> 09:25.869
[knock at door]

09:29.351 --> 09:31.005
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.270
Thank you so much for having us.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.402
Of course,
we're family now, right?

09:37.446 --> 09:38.969
I will get a vase for these.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.710
Oh. Thank you.

09:42.669 --> 09:43.844
[sighs]

09:45.715 --> 09:47.587
[instrumental music]

09:50.285 --> 09:51.634
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey, dad.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.244
Hey.

09:53.288 --> 09:54.985
So glad you both could make it.

09:55.029 --> 09:56.770
Tiffany has been working
on this all afternoon.

09:57.422 --> 09:58.989
Voila.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.600
I'll set this
on the table for you.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.297
Oh, thank you, Jackie.

10:05.430 --> 10:06.736
[sighs]

10:13.003 --> 10:14.135
[Tiffany]
'I'll pick you up.. Oh.'

10:14.178 --> 10:15.876
Your arrangement's lovely.

10:15.919 --> 10:19.749
Oh, I dabble in tablescapes
and interior design.

10:19.793 --> 10:22.926
You certainly do know
how to decorate a room.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.493
Uh, among other talents,
of course.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.626
Stop it.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.366
Renata just brought in
some blooms from the garden.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.020
I spruced them up a little bit.

10:30.064 --> 10:31.761
Where is Renata anyway?

10:31.805 --> 10:33.241
I brought a souvenir.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.069
I think I saw her outside.

10:35.112 --> 10:36.592
- Okay, I'll be back.
- Okay.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.246
Did you wanna drink, Jackie?

10:38.289 --> 10:40.378
Uh, dinner is still
a couple of moments away.

10:40.422 --> 10:42.076
Mitch and I went
wine tasting in France

10:42.119 --> 10:45.296
'and I think we came back
with one of every bottle.'

10:45.340 --> 10:47.734
We can't cheap out
when it comes to vino, right?

10:47.777 --> 10:49.953
Oh, why don't we start
with the bottle Jackie got us?

10:49.997 --> 10:53.217
- 'Yeah.'
- Actually, it-it's fine.

10:53.261 --> 10:55.872
- It's, uh, Bristol Creek.
- Oh.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.570
Shop 'n Save's finest.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.313
And we've spent 20 minutes
under the hood

11:02.357 --> 11:04.272
trying to figure out
what was wrong

11:04.315 --> 11:06.796
and then I finally confess
that I'd run out of gas.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.582
Mechanics never
were your strong suit.

11:10.626 --> 11:12.715
Hey, I'm better in the courtroom
than I am in the garage.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.151
Mm-hmm.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.023
Anyway, he took me
to go and get gas

11:16.066 --> 11:19.374
and then back to my car,
and the rest is history.

11:20.462 --> 11:22.507
Jackie, more wine?

11:22.551 --> 11:23.900
[Jackie]
'Sure. Maybe a little. Thanks.'

11:23.944 --> 11:25.554
Brooke, did you want some?

11:25.597 --> 11:27.338
Whoa. Brooke isn't drinking.

11:27.382 --> 11:28.426
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just thought..

11:28.470 --> 11:29.819
She's 16.

11:29.863 --> 11:31.647
I'm 17 next week.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.431
- And in Europe...
- We don't live in Europe.

11:33.475 --> 11:35.433
'And you are not drinking.'

11:35.477 --> 11:37.653
End of discussion, Brooke.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.440
So, Brooke, how was your
first week of school?

11:42.484 --> 11:43.877
Did you get
your schedule sorted?

11:43.920 --> 11:45.748
They let me drop French,
just like you said.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.750
- Hmm.
- Wait, what?

11:47.794 --> 11:48.838
You dropped French?

11:48.882 --> 11:50.579
Yeah, I'm taking
Spanish instead.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.322
Look, it meets my language

11:54.365 --> 11:55.758
requirement,
what's the big deal?

11:55.802 --> 11:57.151
Well, you've already devoted

11:57.194 --> 11:59.501
two years to studying French.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.764
And the whole reason
I got talked into this trip

12:01.808 --> 12:03.592
'was so that you could further
your language studies.'

12:03.635 --> 12:06.247
Brooke's crush takes Spanish so.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.031
Honey, I don't like
the idea of you planning

12:08.075 --> 12:09.554
your schedule around a boy.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.121
Well, if I take French Three
this year

12:11.165 --> 12:12.732
I have to take
AP French next year.

12:12.775 --> 12:15.038
Yes, wasn't that the plan?

12:15.082 --> 12:17.345
I mean, who signed off
on this? Mitch?

12:17.388 --> 12:18.955
Tiffany and I didn't think
it was that big of a deal.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.696
Well, I'm pretty sure
that I'm still Brooke's mom.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.653
- Right?
- Come on, please.

12:21.697 --> 12:22.742
Let her have fun.

12:22.785 --> 12:23.786
What's high school for?

12:23.830 --> 12:25.614
An education.

12:25.657 --> 12:27.094
I think that kids can make
their own decisions.

12:27.137 --> 12:28.486
Well, when you have a daughter

12:28.530 --> 12:30.140
you can let her do
whatever you want.

12:31.272 --> 12:33.143
[instrumental music]

12:38.409 --> 12:44.024
I'm sorry. Maybe this,
this whole thing is a bad idea.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.853
Jackie, I'm sorry.
I-I can't help but be like this.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.942
- This is my fault.
- Don't be.

12:48.985 --> 12:50.857
She's being dramatic.
Right, dad?

12:56.950 --> 12:58.168
Jackie..

12:59.648 --> 13:01.519
Jackie, would you please wait?

13:04.218 --> 13:05.872
- What was that in there?
- That was you.

13:05.915 --> 13:08.048
Cutting me out of parenting
decisions about our daughter.

13:08.091 --> 13:09.919
- It's just a class schedule.
- She's in high school.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.660
Her life is her class schedule.

13:11.703 --> 13:13.314
Tiffany put a lot of work
into that dinner.

13:13.357 --> 13:14.837
You barely eat two bites,
and you just get up and leave.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.099
Yeah, it seems like
it's not the only thing

13:16.143 --> 13:17.492
she's put a lot of work into.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.755
She's trying.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.539
Let's go back inside.
Come on.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.454
Please, I cannot
go back in there.

13:23.498 --> 13:24.629
[cell phone beeps]

13:32.724 --> 13:34.901
It's fine. It's fine.

13:34.944 --> 13:37.294
It'll give everyone
a little time to cool off.

13:38.948 --> 13:43.083
Please tell her,
tell them both that I apologize.

13:45.476 --> 13:46.477
Are you sure?

13:46.521 --> 13:48.740
[dramatic music]

13:48.784 --> 13:50.090
Yeah.

13:50.133 --> 13:51.700
Look I know this,
the whole thing

13:51.743 --> 13:53.049
'i-it's a big adjustment.'

13:54.398 --> 13:55.791
We'll figure it out.

13:56.836 --> 13:57.967
Yeah.

14:12.025 --> 14:14.897
[intense music]

14:33.481 --> 14:37.180
Hey, Renata. Would you mind
cleaning the rest of this up?

14:47.321 --> 14:48.539

'The offer is competitive,
and we have someone else'

14:48.583 --> 14:49.976
coming in with cash.

14:51.281 --> 14:53.109
Okay.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.416
If they're serious,
I'll show them the house today.

14:57.113 --> 14:58.288
Now?

15:00.160 --> 15:01.683
Yeah, I could probably
make that happen

15:01.726 --> 15:03.076
but I need to get going.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.949
Okay. Great.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.429
I'll see you there in 30.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.998
[bell rings]

15:21.094 --> 15:23.183
- Tiffany?
- Hi.

15:25.533 --> 15:28.014
I'm sorry. I really only
have a minute to spare.

15:28.057 --> 15:30.407
- I have a client I have to...
- I'm sorry.

15:30.451 --> 15:33.062
It wasn't okay that I didn't
include you in the conversation

15:33.106 --> 15:34.672
about Brooke's schedule.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.413
No, it wasn't.

15:38.459 --> 15:43.072
But I suppose I owe you
an apology as well.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.727
I overreacted,
or at least reacted

15:45.770 --> 15:47.685
in the wrong time and place.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.861
No, you have nothing
to worry about that.

15:49.905 --> 15:53.082
Brooke's education comes first.

15:53.126 --> 15:55.955
She's just so hard to say no to.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.521
I know she is.

15:57.565 --> 15:58.870
You've known her
for three weeks.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.961
I've raised her
for nearly 17 years.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.615
I appreciate
that you're trying, I do.

16:04.659 --> 16:07.270
And I'm so happy
you two are getting along.

16:07.314 --> 16:10.186
But I'm her mother,
and I need her and you

16:10.230 --> 16:11.971
to respect my authority.

16:14.495 --> 16:15.713
Jackie, I just want this work.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.761
'I love Mitch,
and I love Brooke.'

16:21.632 --> 16:23.547
I just want us to be a family.

16:25.245 --> 16:26.942
Let's start with just friends.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.206
Of course. I would love that.

16:31.512 --> 16:32.687
[cell phone beeps]

16:34.994 --> 16:36.125
Oh, come on.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.997
What is it?

16:38.040 --> 16:40.564
Uh, my showing just got moved up
and I was supposed

16:40.608 --> 16:42.479
to pick up Brooke from school.
Now I'm gonna be late.

16:42.523 --> 16:43.915
I could pick her up.

16:45.482 --> 16:47.441
No, it's fine.
I-I'll figure it out.

16:47.484 --> 16:49.312
Honestly, it's not a problem.

16:49.356 --> 16:52.054
In fact, it would actually help
with my guilt from last night.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.535
[cell phone ringing]

16:57.059 --> 16:58.060
If you're sure you don't mind.

16:58.104 --> 16:59.105
Of course, I don't mind.

16:59.148 --> 17:00.541
You go do whatever
you need to do

17:00.584 --> 17:01.933
and I will pick Brooke up
from school.

17:03.239 --> 17:05.023
Hello. I am on my way.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.676
Thank you, Tiffany.
I owe you one.

17:08.462 --> 17:11.813
Oh, Jackie, um, Brooke
has my rose gold clutch.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.336
Do you mind if I quickly..

17:15.469 --> 17:17.732
Sure, yeah. Just make sure
you lock the door.

17:17.775 --> 17:19.951
Of course. Go, go, go.
You'll be late.

18:41.685 --> 18:45.820
Wow, so..
Total freak-out meltdown.

18:45.863 --> 18:48.344
It was so embarrassing.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.172
No, it doesn't sound
like your mom.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.131
Yeah, well, it was.

18:52.174 --> 18:54.437
She completely ripped Tiffany's
head off for no reason.

18:54.481 --> 18:56.526
I mean, lucky for her, Tiffany
is too nice to fight back.

18:56.570 --> 18:59.094
Yeah, your step-mom actually
seems pretty cool.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.183
Like, she seems like
the type of person

19:01.227 --> 19:03.577
who should have her own
reality show.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.709
Or sex tape.

19:05.753 --> 19:08.451
Or a reality show
and a sex tape.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.410
Yeah, my mom wouldn't let me
watch either one.

19:10.453 --> 19:12.934
Yeah.

19:12.977 --> 19:16.111
- Speaking of watching things..
- My favorite show.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.765
Too bad,
we only see the previews.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.463
What are we watching?

19:20.507 --> 19:22.073
Tiffany, what are you
doing here?

19:22.117 --> 19:23.423
I came to pick you up.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.207
I thought my mom
was picking me up.

19:25.251 --> 19:26.817
Uh, I think she has something
more important to do.

19:28.515 --> 19:31.126
Is that him?
You weren't kidding. Good eye.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.476
Great eyes, and everything else.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.305
She's hopeless.

'Well, go say hi to him.'

19:37.785 --> 19:39.569

'What? No way.'

Brooke, if you want something,
you need to work for it.

19:41.963 --> 19:44.008
Go and say hi.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.359

'Too late.
Guess I missed my chance.'

19:46.402 --> 19:48.012
No, you didn't. Let's go.

Come on. Up. Come on, quick.

["Body Talk"]

19:58.240 --> 19:59.850
I can't believe
you talked me into this.

19:59.894 --> 20:02.113
You girls are learning
from a master, okay.

20:02.157 --> 20:04.681
Listen up, take notes.
This is a very serious business.

20:11.732 --> 20:13.037
I'm dying.

20:13.081 --> 20:15.518
What's the problem?

20:15.562 --> 20:18.826
Oh, you mean, besides the fact
that we've officially crossed

20:18.869 --> 20:20.219
the line into stalkers.

his attention.

I don't even know
what to say to him.

20:28.401 --> 20:31.142
You don't say anything.

works every time.

- Tiffany, no.

together sometime.

we can hang out again.

Yeah, you're 16, why don't you
have a license yet?

23:09.562 --> 23:11.433

23:11.477 --> 23:13.261
She can be pretty
controlling, huh?

It's just,
I-I got in trouble last year

23:16.656 --> 23:18.919
she doesn't want me
to have a car yet.

23:18.962 --> 23:20.268
It seems like
a long time to hold

23:20.311 --> 23:21.965
something like that over you.

23:22.009 --> 23:23.793
You gotta live your life.

23:23.837 --> 23:26.840
I mean, you seem like a pretty
responsible young lady to me.

than happy to drop you off

23:29.364 --> 23:31.235

hang out with Beau.

24:01.222 --> 24:04.181
I have been sitting here worried
about you for hours.

24:04.225 --> 24:06.227
'Where were you?'

24:06.270 --> 24:10.100
Uh, I-I'm sorry, Taylor and I
went to the mall with Tiffany.

24:10.144 --> 24:12.929
- Tiffany.
- Y-yeah, so?

24:12.973 --> 24:16.411
So I called you three times.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.545
Look, I said I was sorry.
I lost track of time.

24:19.588 --> 24:21.590
Why are you being
so controlling anyway?

24:21.634 --> 24:23.940
I just expect you to let me know
where you are, Brooke.

24:23.984 --> 24:26.116
That's not controlling.
That's courtesy.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.553
And honestly, I can't believe

24:27.596 --> 24:29.076
that Tiffany is that
irresponsible either.

24:29.119 --> 24:31.382
- You're jealous of her.
- What? No.

24:31.426 --> 24:32.993
You completely flipp out
on her at dinner

24:33.036 --> 24:34.211
and now you're flipping out
again over nothing.

24:34.255 --> 24:36.083
No, this is not nothing.

24:36.126 --> 24:38.651
You need to let me know
where you are, baby.

24:38.694 --> 24:39.782
Whatever.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.091
Wait.

24:44.134 --> 24:47.137
What were you saying
when you came in? Who's Beau?

24:47.181 --> 24:48.791
What do you care?

24:58.671 --> 25:00.499
They were right here.

25:02.370 --> 25:03.632
Brooke?

25:05.808 --> 25:07.506
What's up?

25:07.549 --> 25:09.420
Have you seen
the Chandler contracts?

25:09.464 --> 25:11.901
I can't find them anywhere.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.860
Why would I have seen them?

25:13.903 --> 25:15.339
Well, they were on my desk

25:15.383 --> 25:16.471
and if I don't turn those
in tomorrow

25:16.515 --> 25:17.864
their sale could fall apart.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.518
I-I'll help you look.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.918
Where's your earrings? Please
tell me you didn't lose them.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.572
They cost more than my car.

25:30.616 --> 25:33.749
No, I, I thought I left them
on the bathroom counter

25:33.793 --> 25:35.925
but, I mean, I definitely took
them off in the house.

25:35.969 --> 25:36.970
They have to be there somewhere.

25:37.013 --> 25:38.101
They will show up.

25:39.146 --> 25:40.451
How was your day?

25:41.888 --> 25:43.846
It was okay.

25:43.890 --> 25:45.195
Just okay?

25:46.893 --> 25:50.461
- Well, I've been thinking..
- Uh-oh.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.942
Do we really need Renata
around all the time?

25:52.986 --> 25:55.292
I thought you liked having help
around the house.

25:55.336 --> 25:58.165
Well, I love that
you wanna take care of me

25:58.208 --> 26:00.036
but I don't know,
it doesn't feel like our house

26:00.080 --> 26:02.561
with a stranger there
all the time.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.475
Renata's not a stranger,
she's been in our family

26:04.519 --> 26:07.391
since... Jackie was pregnant
with Brooke.

26:07.435 --> 26:10.220
Well, exactly.
Now Brooke's all grown up.

26:10.264 --> 26:12.396
I like making our house a home.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.877
- I like taking care of you.
- Good.

26:14.921 --> 26:16.879
I mean, just because Jackie
couldn't handle it...

26:16.923 --> 26:19.229
Oh, wait, Tiffany,
it wasn't like that.

26:19.273 --> 26:21.623
Okay, sorry,
what I mean is, um..

26:21.667 --> 26:24.757
I see how Jackie gets
overwhelmed easily.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.802
And what makes you think that?

26:26.846 --> 26:28.456
Nothing.

26:28.499 --> 26:29.413
Something must have happened,
otherwise

26:29.457 --> 26:31.198
you wouldn't have brought it up.

26:31.241 --> 26:33.069
Okay, well, Jackie asked me to
pick up Brooke up from school.

26:33.113 --> 26:35.028
Jackie asked you
to go pick Brooke?

26:35.071 --> 26:37.378
Oh, it was fine. We had some
girl time. It was great.

26:37.421 --> 26:38.509
But, I mean,
it was really last minute

26:38.553 --> 26:40.555
and she seemed very flustered.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.470
Okay, well, maybe
something came up.

26:42.513 --> 26:44.298
Something more important
than Brooke?

26:46.300 --> 26:48.563
I'm sorry. I don't want to get
in the middle of this.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.783
I just thought
that you should know.

26:50.826 --> 26:52.567
Alright. Fair enough.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.135
I will check in with Jackie

26:55.178 --> 26:56.658
and we'll talk about Renata.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.007
Okay?

27:02.185 --> 27:03.534
Thank you.

27:05.928 --> 27:08.148
Wait, isn't it
Brooke's birthday soon?

27:08.191 --> 27:10.629
- Next week.
- Seventeen, right?

27:10.672 --> 27:13.283
Yes. Why do you ask?

27:13.327 --> 27:15.459
Maybe I have a good idea
for her birthday present.

27:21.074 --> 27:22.684
[Jackie]
'Hey. She still in the shower?'

27:22.728 --> 27:26.079
Yeah. Um, she's trying that new
leave-in conditioner stuff

27:26.122 --> 27:27.907
so you've got at least
20 minutes.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.082
Great.

27:33.608 --> 27:35.088
That's the one she wanted,
right?

27:35.131 --> 27:37.568
No. I mean, it's all wrong.

27:37.612 --> 27:38.831
I-I could take it off
your hands for you.

27:38.874 --> 27:40.963
No, I'm not falling for that.

27:41.007 --> 27:43.226
I really can't believe
that you got that for her.

27:43.270 --> 27:45.402
She's been lusting
after it for months.

27:45.446 --> 27:47.230
Yeah, well, I'm gonna be
paying for it for months

27:47.274 --> 27:50.059
but you only turn
17 once, right?

27:50.103 --> 27:51.844
Although, judging by my mom,
you turn 39

27:51.887 --> 27:53.541
at least three or four times.

27:56.457 --> 27:58.285
[instrumental music]

28:00.330 --> 28:03.333
"Brooke, you are my heart.

28:03.377 --> 28:06.597
"You brighten my day just
by being a part of my life.

28:06.641 --> 28:08.251
"I love you more than anything.

28:08.295 --> 28:10.036
Your proud mom."

28:12.342 --> 28:14.127
- You misspelled heart.
- What?

28:15.824 --> 28:16.999
Kidding.

28:18.479 --> 28:20.742
She's gonna love it.
Really.

28:20.786 --> 28:21.917
Thanks.

28:27.357 --> 28:29.751
- Happy birthday, birthday girl.
- Thank you.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.405
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, baby.

28:31.448 --> 28:33.407
Wait, is this the top
that I got you? This is amazing.

28:33.450 --> 28:34.713
Thanks for coming.

28:36.497 --> 28:38.499
How are ya?

28:38.542 --> 28:40.240
- Good.
- Seriously?

28:41.154 --> 28:43.112
Yeah. I'm serious.

28:43.156 --> 28:45.332
I still get to be concerned
about you, you know.

28:46.246 --> 28:47.900
I'm good. Really.

28:47.943 --> 28:49.902
Good.

28:49.945 --> 28:52.121
Uh, so listen, before we get
the big party started...

28:52.165 --> 28:53.383
[Brooke screams]

28:53.427 --> 28:54.776
Brooke?

28:54.820 --> 28:56.038
Tiffany's gonna give me
driving lessons.

28:56.082 --> 28:58.171
'Isn't that cool, mom?'

28:58.214 --> 29:00.042
Uh, Mitch, we haven't really
talked about this.

29:00.086 --> 29:02.566
- I know.
- Uh, dad, can I please?

29:05.482 --> 29:07.746
Sure. I guess.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.748
Okay, well, that isn't all.

29:09.791 --> 29:11.532
Wait, Tiffany,
I haven't had a chance...

29:11.575 --> 29:14.187
So I thought that if you're
gonna have driving lessons

29:14.230 --> 29:16.755
then you should probably
have them in your car.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.539
Okay, wait.
One second, please.

29:18.582 --> 29:20.541
'Yeah, my lease was up,
and I was like "No 17-year-old'

29:20.584 --> 29:22.064
should be without
her own vehicle."

29:22.108 --> 29:24.806
So happy birthday,
birthday girl.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.634
Oh, this is amazing.
Can we drive it right now?

29:26.677 --> 29:28.375
- Mitch.
- Will you hold on a second?

29:28.418 --> 29:30.943
- No, you hold on. Do you...
- 'Would you please stop?'

29:30.986 --> 29:33.162
It was just last year
that she snuck out

29:33.206 --> 29:34.468
wrecked the car
drinking and driving.

29:34.511 --> 29:35.861
Stop it.

29:37.906 --> 29:39.473
Surprise.

29:43.738 --> 29:44.695
[horn blows]

29:45.653 --> 29:47.133
Brooke, wait.

29:51.659 --> 29:52.834
That's horrible.

29:52.878 --> 29:55.489
Shh shh shh.

29:55.532 --> 29:58.622
The entire school
is going to know.

29:58.666 --> 30:01.277
She said all of that
in front of Beau.

30:01.321 --> 30:03.671
I'm so sorry, Brooke.

30:03.714 --> 30:07.544
I mean, I can't even believe
that your mom did that.

30:07.588 --> 30:10.330
Hey. It's not like
she did it on purpose.

30:11.897 --> 30:14.203
What difference does it make?

30:14.247 --> 30:15.988
Brooke's humiliated either way.

30:16.031 --> 30:19.382
I mean, her mom can't keep
freaking out like that.

30:19.426 --> 30:20.731
[knock at door]

30:24.431 --> 30:26.259
- 'Brooke... '
- Go away!

30:26.302 --> 30:29.001
- I'm so sorry, honey. I...
- You humiliated me.

30:29.044 --> 30:30.611
I made one stupid mistake
a year ago

30:30.654 --> 30:31.917
and you keep throwing it
in my face.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.876
- No, sweetie...
- Just get out.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.835
- Brooke, please...
- Go.

30:39.620 --> 30:42.492
[dramatic music]

30:49.804 --> 30:52.676
[instrumental music]

31:14.698 --> 31:16.178
[Mitch]
'Hey, babe. How is she?'

31:16.222 --> 31:19.268
Uh, hurt. Humiliated. Angry.

31:19.312 --> 31:20.922
Yup, she's a teenager.

31:20.966 --> 31:22.663
Mitch, come on,
her feelings are really hurt.

31:22.706 --> 31:24.360
No, I'm just playing.

31:24.404 --> 31:27.233
- Is Jackie stable?
- What?

31:27.276 --> 31:29.626
Well, come on, I mean,
she runs out on dinner.

31:29.670 --> 31:31.454
She shuns her responsibilities
with Brooke.

31:31.498 --> 31:33.761
She completely destroys
her birthday party.

31:33.804 --> 31:36.329
I'm just a little bit concerned.

31:36.372 --> 31:39.419
You know, to tell you the truth,
I don't really know.

31:39.462 --> 31:41.203
We haven't had much contact
since the divorce.

31:41.247 --> 31:42.726
I barely talk to her now.

31:42.770 --> 31:45.947
I-I just assumed
that she was struggling

31:45.991 --> 31:48.254
with me getting remarried,
but maybe you're right.

31:48.297 --> 31:50.169
Maybe there's more to it.

31:50.212 --> 31:53.041
Maybe you could suggest Brooke
staying here for a little while?

31:53.085 --> 31:55.652
I mean, I don't know if I'm very
comfortable with her being there

31:55.696 --> 31:57.567
if Jackie is having a hard time
dealing with this.

31:57.611 --> 31:59.700
I don't think Jackie
would ever go for that.

31:59.743 --> 32:03.443
Well, maybe she needs space and
doesn't know how to ask for it.

32:03.486 --> 32:05.967
I mean, think about how happy
Brooke would be?

32:06.011 --> 32:08.100
Hmm? Here with us.

32:08.143 --> 32:09.971
How happy we all would be?

32:14.758 --> 32:16.978
The three of us here together
like a little family.

32:18.023 --> 32:19.372
I'll tell you what..

32:20.373 --> 32:21.940
I'll think about it.

32:23.115 --> 32:24.638
Thank you.

32:24.681 --> 32:26.509
Go check on your daughter.
I'll clean up here.

32:26.553 --> 32:27.858
Thank you.

32:29.295 --> 32:32.167
[dramatic music]

32:49.402 --> 32:50.359
[knock at door]

32:50.403 --> 32:51.578
Yes?

32:53.058 --> 32:54.885
I don't mean to interrupt.

32:54.929 --> 32:57.366
You're never a bother, Renata.
What's up?

32:57.410 --> 32:59.281
I found this out in the garage.

32:59.325 --> 33:02.632
Oh. Great. Thank you.

33:02.676 --> 33:05.722
I didn't want anything
to happen to it.

33:05.766 --> 33:07.681
Thank you for being
so thorough, Renata.

33:07.724 --> 33:09.857
Of course, Mrs. McClain.

33:09.900 --> 33:12.599
You don't have to be so formal.
We're all family, remember?

33:12.642 --> 33:15.036
Yeah. I'll let you
go back to work.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.820
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

33:26.743 --> 33:29.137
Mm-hmm. Alright,
I'll talk to you later.

33:33.359 --> 33:35.404
- Good morning, Renata.
- Good morning.

33:35.448 --> 33:37.232
So I have a huge favor
to ask you.

33:37.276 --> 33:39.147
I-I'm wanting to get
the storage room cleared out.

33:39.191 --> 33:41.976
I have some summer clothes
that I'm wanting to store.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.196
- That is a big job.
- Oh, that's okay.

33:44.239 --> 33:45.675
You can take all the time
you need.

33:45.719 --> 33:47.503
I'm happy to do
the housework today.

33:47.547 --> 33:49.244
Yeah, of course.

33:49.288 --> 33:50.680
I will start right away.

33:50.724 --> 33:52.073
Great.

33:52.117 --> 33:54.771
[dramatic music]

33:59.733 --> 34:01.691
[birds chirping]

34:03.258 --> 34:05.434
Mm. Smells good in here.

34:05.478 --> 34:06.827
Fresh pasta.

34:09.264 --> 34:11.092
Please at least get a fork.

34:12.702 --> 34:15.096
Here. Uh,
it's just us tonight

34:15.139 --> 34:16.750
so I thought that
we could eat in here.

34:16.793 --> 34:18.534
Fine by me.

34:22.451 --> 34:24.062
Uh, thank you.

34:25.585 --> 34:27.587
Oh, I forgot, I made a salad.

34:27.630 --> 34:28.804
'Nice.'

34:30.677 --> 34:32.112
Ow!

34:32.157 --> 34:33.897
You alright?

34:33.940 --> 34:36.161
No. Something pricked me.

34:36.204 --> 34:37.987
Oh, well, let's see.

34:41.166 --> 34:42.645
Here. Voila.

34:42.688 --> 34:44.168
My earrings?

34:44.212 --> 34:45.822
Oh, thank you.

34:45.866 --> 34:47.563
I've been looking
for these everywhere.

34:47.607 --> 34:50.088
I'm glad you found them.
Here's your sweater back.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.829
Oh, this isn't mine.
It's Renata's.

34:52.873 --> 34:55.440
What are your diamonds
doing in Renata's sweater?

34:55.484 --> 34:57.094
You don't think that she..

34:58.270 --> 34:59.619
No. No, she would never do that.

34:59.662 --> 35:01.011
No.

35:01.055 --> 35:02.926
[dramatic music]

48:17.982 --> 48:19.679
- Alright, call me!
- 'Brooke!'

48:23.683 --> 48:25.728
You're sneaking boys
into the house now?

48:25.772 --> 48:28.122
Not boys, just Beau.

48:28.166 --> 48:29.123
And we weren't even
in the house...

48:29.167 --> 48:30.429
You know the rules!

48:30.472 --> 48:31.647
You know, I'm getting old enough

48:31.691 --> 48:32.910
to make my own decisions.

48:32.953 --> 48:34.737
Brooke, just go to your room.

48:34.781 --> 48:36.174
'We'll talk
about this later, okay?'

48:41.396 --> 48:42.745
- Maybe I could go and see...
- Butt out, Tiffany!

48:42.789 --> 48:44.008
This doesn't involve you.

48:44.051 --> 48:46.010
Don't talk to her like that.

48:46.053 --> 48:48.012
You show up drunk at our house

48:48.055 --> 48:50.536
'leave our daughter alone to do
who knows what with some boy.'

48:50.579 --> 48:52.712
No, no, I was coming there
to see you, Mitch.

48:52.755 --> 48:55.454
Jackie, I'm remarried!

48:55.497 --> 48:56.368
'You can't just show up
whenever you want!'

48:56.411 --> 48:57.412
No, Tiffany...

48:57.456 --> 48:58.500
Tiffany didn't pass out

48:58.544 --> 49:00.024
behind the wheel of her car.

49:00.067 --> 49:01.982
That was you.
Show some responsibility.

49:02.026 --> 49:03.201
Okay, now, wait, wait..

49:03.244 --> 49:05.246
She, she set me up..

49:05.290 --> 49:07.596
Jackie, you sure you didn't
just mix your alcohol

49:07.640 --> 49:09.033
with some medication?

49:11.296 --> 49:12.688
Let me make you
some coffee. Here.

49:13.385 --> 49:15.909
Okay?

49:15.953 --> 49:18.868
Hold on, wait, what's this?
What happened here?

49:18.912 --> 49:20.696
It's fine, Mitch.
She didn't mean to, okay?

49:20.740 --> 49:22.829
You did this to her?

49:22.872 --> 49:24.265
That is ludicrous.

49:24.309 --> 49:26.137
Look, I tried to
stop her from leaving

49:26.180 --> 49:27.573
but she was insistent that
she wanted to get back.

49:27.616 --> 49:29.009
You put your hands on my wife?

49:29.053 --> 49:30.663
I most certainly did not.

49:30.706 --> 49:32.186
It's fine, Mitch. It'll heal
in a couple of weeks.

49:32.230 --> 49:34.014
No, no-no-no, it's not.
No, it's not.

49:34.058 --> 49:36.016
This is how this
is gonna go now.

49:36.060 --> 49:37.931
Brooke's gonna come
stay with us for a few days

49:37.975 --> 49:39.715
- 'while you sort yourself out.'
- No, no!

49:39.759 --> 49:42.370
I will not have my daughter
living in this environment.

49:42.414 --> 49:44.459
- Wait, wait.
- 'Get some help, Jackie!'

49:44.503 --> 49:45.591
You're better than this.

49:47.114 --> 49:48.768
Wait in the car,
I'll go get Brooke.

49:49.987 --> 49:52.859
[intense music]

50:14.141 --> 50:16.578
You may have everybody else
fooled..

50:16.622 --> 50:18.363
...but you don't fool me.

50:19.364 --> 50:21.322
Oh, I see you.

50:21.366 --> 50:24.978
With your perfect hair,
and your perfect house

50:25.022 --> 50:27.024
and your perfect everything.

50:28.155 --> 50:29.765
I know what you're doing.

50:31.115 --> 50:32.855
You're pathetic.

50:44.519 --> 50:46.739
[instrumental music]

50:46.782 --> 50:48.610
[footsteps]

50:51.135 --> 50:52.832
Brooke, did you want..

51:15.942 --> 51:18.336
Hi. I'm just calling
from my daughter's phone.

51:18.379 --> 51:20.990
She's just been through a..

51:21.034 --> 51:24.690
...terrible break-up, and
he keeps calling and texting.

51:24.733 --> 51:26.083
I'm not sure if there's
something you could do

51:26.126 --> 51:27.171
or if you could, you know..

51:29.695 --> 51:32.524
Block the number,
that would be wonderful.

51:36.397 --> 51:38.269
Yes, you can forward all
the calls and text to me.

51:38.312 --> 51:39.618
Thank you so much.

51:41.794 --> 51:43.578
What are you doin' in my room?

51:43.622 --> 51:45.624
Hey, baby. I just came to see
if you were doing okay.

51:45.667 --> 51:48.279
I thought maybe you might have
been a bit upset from earlier.

51:48.322 --> 51:49.932
Upset about what?

51:49.976 --> 51:52.065
I mean, no one will tell me
what's going on.

51:52.109 --> 51:53.675
Like, why were you and dad
at our house?

51:53.719 --> 51:54.937
Is mom okay?

51:57.114 --> 51:59.028
Why don't we take a seat
for a second? Okay?

52:00.987 --> 52:02.423
Come here.

52:04.469 --> 52:06.819
Okay, look..

52:06.862 --> 52:09.126
Your mom is fine, okay?

52:09.169 --> 52:12.172
She just had a little bit
too much to drink and..

52:12.216 --> 52:14.696
...made a bit of a scene.

52:14.740 --> 52:16.568
She wanted to drive
her own car home

52:16.611 --> 52:19.397
and naturally
your dad intervened.

52:19.440 --> 52:22.965
And it was a little bit
upsetting for everybody.

52:24.228 --> 52:26.795
I can't believe this.

52:26.839 --> 52:29.755
- I'm so sorry, Brooke.
- No, you don't understand.

52:29.798 --> 52:31.322
Her head practically exploded

52:31.365 --> 52:33.062
when I got caught
drinking last year.

52:33.106 --> 52:36.196
I got lectured for months.
Why didn't my dad tell me this?

52:36.240 --> 52:38.198
Well, I think he's just trying
to protect your feelings, honey.

52:38.242 --> 52:39.678
From what?

52:44.378 --> 52:46.598
Okay, I... I'm gonna tell you.

52:46.641 --> 52:48.295
But you have to promise
not to tell your dad, okay?

52:48.339 --> 52:49.949
'Cause he would kill me.

52:49.992 --> 52:51.559
Of course, what is it?

52:54.388 --> 52:56.651
Your mom kinda blames you.

52:59.524 --> 53:01.352
What do you mean?

53:01.395 --> 53:03.832
She said that apparently
you guys have been having

53:03.876 --> 53:06.748
a rough time lately and that
you've been fighting a lot.

53:06.792 --> 53:12.101
And that... she was feeling
overwhelmed and..

53:12.145 --> 53:16.541
I guess she was trying to
explain why she's been drinking.

53:16.584 --> 53:19.152
So, it, it's my fault?

53:19.196 --> 53:20.806
Oh, she just asked if you could
come stay for a couple of days.

53:20.849 --> 53:22.329
And of course, we said yes.

53:22.373 --> 53:25.898
Oh, wait. She doesn't
want me at home anymore?

53:25.941 --> 53:28.901
She just needs some space,
but in the meantime..

53:28.944 --> 53:30.729
...we are so happy
to have you here.

53:33.122 --> 53:36.996
Ah, would you mind if I was
by myself for a little bit?

53:37.692 --> 53:39.738
Of course.

53:39.781 --> 53:42.610
You know that you can talk to me
about anything, okay?

53:46.353 --> 53:47.615
Yeah?

53:49.313 --> 53:50.705
Okay.

53:53.534 --> 53:55.841
Oh, and, Brooke..

53:59.975 --> 54:01.368
Welcome home.

54:02.935 --> 54:04.632
[music continues]

54:11.117 --> 54:12.336
Everything alright?

54:12.379 --> 54:13.946
[cell phone chimes]

54:16.818 --> 54:18.951
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

54:18.994 --> 54:20.300
[ell phone beeps]

54:25.653 --> 54:27.612
- 'Are you sure?'
- Yes, I'm sure.

54:27.655 --> 54:29.135
Why do you keep asking me that?

54:29.178 --> 54:32.138
Because, it doesn't
sound like your mom, B.

54:32.181 --> 54:34.488
Oh, it is. She's
a hypocrite and a liar

54:34.532 --> 54:36.534
and my dad won't even
tell me what's going on.

54:38.275 --> 54:39.928
He made Tiffany promise
not to tell her.

54:39.972 --> 54:41.321
So, this is all
coming from Tiffany?

54:41.365 --> 54:42.844
Yeah, she's the only one

54:42.888 --> 54:44.106
who'll actually tell me
what's going on.

54:45.760 --> 54:48.285
Brooke, it just seems like

54:48.328 --> 54:49.808
everything has gone
so downhill with your mom

54:49.851 --> 54:51.505
ever since she showed up.

54:51.549 --> 54:54.116
Yeah, it's given my mom
an excuse to flip out.

54:54.160 --> 54:56.031
I don't know.

54:56.075 --> 54:57.381
Why do you keep defending her?

54:57.424 --> 55:00.035
Because your mom
is a good person.

55:00.079 --> 55:01.950
Brooke, she's always
been there for you.

55:01.994 --> 55:04.039
I mean, what do you even
know about Tiffany?

55:04.083 --> 55:05.737
"She's a good person?"

55:05.780 --> 55:08.217
She didn't even want me
in the house anymore.

55:08.261 --> 55:10.132
You know, at least
Tiffany wants me around.

55:11.743 --> 55:13.353
Awkward.

55:13.397 --> 55:14.528
- I'll go get her.
- 'Don't.'

55:15.442 --> 55:17.226
Just let her be.

55:17.270 --> 55:18.619
Trust me.

55:23.668 --> 55:25.191
Tiffany?

55:25.234 --> 55:27.193
Ah, hey!

55:27.236 --> 55:28.803
I was hoping to surprise you,
I'm just gonna head

55:28.847 --> 55:30.849
to the school office
and sign you out.

55:30.892 --> 55:33.068
- What for?
- Hmm?

55:33.112 --> 55:34.766
Well, I was thinking
about you this morning..

55:34.809 --> 55:36.289
...what with everything going on
with your mom and all.

55:36.333 --> 55:38.073
And I thought..

55:38.117 --> 55:39.945
...maybe we could get started on
those driving lessons

55:39.988 --> 55:41.381
a little early today.

55:41.425 --> 55:43.731
Best idea ever!

55:43.775 --> 55:45.646
Good, let's go bail you out.

55:45.690 --> 55:47.692
Oh, yeah, you really don't look
too good, do you?

55:47.735 --> 55:49.128
What?

55:49.171 --> 55:51.652
- Hmm?
- Oh.

55:51.696 --> 55:53.567
- Good girl.
- I'm so feverish.

55:53.611 --> 55:55.264
[Tiffany]
'I know.'

55:55.308 --> 55:57.354
Okay, well, first things first.

55:59.181 --> 56:03.055
A playlist. Do you want
Top 40 or old school?

56:03.098 --> 56:06.145
Uh, maybe just a clear head
for my first time out.

56:06.188 --> 56:08.277
Sure thing, you are the driver.

56:10.018 --> 56:11.411
You ready?

56:11.455 --> 56:12.760
Ready.

56:17.374 --> 56:19.985
Okay. Let's vamanos!

56:23.162 --> 56:24.076
[tires screech]

56:28.297 --> 56:29.516
[Tiffany]
This isn't a minivan.

56:29.560 --> 56:30.909
You can floor it.

56:31.692 --> 56:34.216
[engine revving]

56:37.306 --> 56:39.396
[dial tone]

56:39.439 --> 56:42.355
[automated message]
'The number is no longer
available. Goodbye.'

56:43.878 --> 56:45.750
[doorbell rings]

56:49.231 --> 56:50.668
Hey, Mrs. M.

56:50.711 --> 56:52.365
Hey, Taylor.

56:52.409 --> 56:54.411
Brooke is staying
with her dad right now.

56:54.454 --> 56:57.152
Umm, yeah, I-I know.

56:57.196 --> 56:58.980
I just came to see
how you're doing.

57:00.678 --> 57:02.070
Come on in.

57:04.899 --> 57:06.814
So, I heard what happened.

57:06.858 --> 57:08.686
You okay?

57:08.729 --> 57:10.383
Just really embarrassed.

57:11.645 --> 57:14.343
I still haven't left the house.

57:14.387 --> 57:16.563
I'm sure Brooke
is taking it hard.

57:16.607 --> 57:19.740
She said that you and Tiffany
were drinking..

57:21.263 --> 57:23.352
Yeah.

57:23.396 --> 57:25.311
Unfortunately, I had too much.

57:27.182 --> 57:28.967
I should've never
gotten in that car.

57:29.010 --> 57:31.273
Ever. It was a terrible mistake.

57:35.190 --> 57:37.715
Baking your woes away?

57:37.758 --> 57:41.414
What's that? Gardenin' not
cuttin' it for you anymore?

57:41.458 --> 57:43.590
Oh, it's nothing. It's garbage.

57:43.634 --> 57:46.375
Literally garbage that I
pulled out of the trash can

57:46.419 --> 57:48.465
at Mitch's house.

57:48.508 --> 57:52.469
I don't know what I was doing,
I was... drunk.

57:52.512 --> 57:55.341
This came from Mitch
and Tiffany's house?

57:55.384 --> 57:56.298
Yeah.

57:58.344 --> 58:00.825
Do you remember that girl Tori
we used to hang out with?

58:00.868 --> 58:02.217
- Trainwreck Tori?
- Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.

58:02.261 --> 58:03.480
Yeah, who could forget?

58:03.523 --> 58:05.046
Yeah, she was awesome.

58:05.960 --> 58:07.092
Anyway, um..

58:08.659 --> 58:09.964
She used to eat a couple
of packets of these

58:10.008 --> 58:11.096
before we went to parties.

58:11.139 --> 58:12.619
I don't get it.

58:12.663 --> 58:14.839
She said it kept her
from getting too drunk.

58:17.145 --> 58:18.320
You can do that?

58:19.278 --> 58:20.671
Tori did.

58:22.629 --> 58:25.371
[instrumental music]

58:52.529 --> 58:54.531
- Hey.
- Hey.

58:56.445 --> 58:57.838
Grounded, huh?

58:57.882 --> 58:59.623
My dad found out
that I cut school

58:59.666 --> 59:02.060
so I am on lockdown
until next week.

59:02.103 --> 59:03.801
Wait, even though
Tiffany took you out?

59:03.844 --> 59:06.586
- He doesn't know that.
- What?

59:06.630 --> 59:08.632
I don't wanna get her
in trouble.

59:08.675 --> 59:10.938
That seems backwards, B.

59:10.982 --> 59:12.505
Well, I'm not gonna
throw her under the bus.

59:12.549 --> 59:14.551
You know, whatever.

59:14.594 --> 59:15.987
Look, I talked to your mom.

59:16.030 --> 59:18.076
I really think
you should call her.

59:18.119 --> 59:20.600
- Well, I don't want to.
- Then go see her.

59:20.644 --> 59:22.341
Ask her for the real
version of the story

59:22.384 --> 59:23.908
and not the secondhand one
you are hearing.

59:23.951 --> 59:26.519
Look, Tiffany says that
I should give myself space.

59:26.563 --> 59:28.434
And I think you should give
yourself space from Tiffany.

59:28.477 --> 59:30.654
And what's that
supposed to mean?

59:30.697 --> 59:32.612
I don't know, I just feel like
there's been a lot of drama

59:32.656 --> 59:34.440
in your life ever since
she showed up.

59:34.483 --> 59:36.616
And ever since she showed up,
you've been a crappy friend.

59:38.052 --> 59:40.925
[instrumental music]

59:43.014 --> 59:44.668
You know what?

59:44.711 --> 59:46.670
Take care of yourself, Brooke.

59:46.713 --> 59:48.497
I worry about you.

01:02:22.129 --> 01:02:24.610
Yes, I will meet you
later this afternoon.

01:02:24.653 --> 01:02:26.786
Everything is set
for the closing.

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:28.875
Thank you so much for
giving me a second chance.

01:02:30.181 --> 01:02:31.269
No, it's your big...

01:02:31.312 --> 01:02:32.661
[screams]

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.762
[Detective Stringer]
'It's hard to say
for sure what happened.'

01:02:45.805 --> 01:02:47.676
Her injuries are consistent
with the slip and fall

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.243
but we're gonna have to wait
for the coroner's report

01:02:49.287 --> 01:02:52.159
in order to determine
the official cause of death.

01:02:52.203 --> 01:02:54.771
Right now, it looks
like a tragic accident.

01:02:54.814 --> 01:02:56.381
Alright, you said you
found her around 8:15.

01:02:56.424 --> 01:02:58.122
Yes.

01:02:58.165 --> 01:02:59.427
You have any idea why
she would have been

01:02:59.471 --> 01:03:01.821
coming to see you?

01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:03.214
She was my daughter's
best friend.

01:03:03.257 --> 01:03:04.693
So, she was here
to see your daughter.

01:03:04.737 --> 01:03:07.218
No, my..

01:03:07.261 --> 01:03:10.003
My daughter's staying
with her father right now.

01:03:10.047 --> 01:03:11.744
I'm not sure why she would
have been coming here.

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:13.311
We were friendly.

01:03:13.354 --> 01:03:15.617
Does the name Mary Smith
mean anything to you?

01:03:16.662 --> 01:03:17.968
No, should it?

01:03:18.011 --> 01:03:19.708
It was written on her hand.

01:03:21.014 --> 01:03:23.060
No, I-I don't know a Mary Smith.

01:03:25.192 --> 01:03:26.628
So, what happens now?

01:03:26.672 --> 01:03:28.413
Well, the parents
have been notified.

01:03:28.456 --> 01:03:30.850
Once they ID the body,
it goes to the county coroners.

01:03:30.894 --> 01:03:32.330
Now, whether or not
we open a file

01:03:32.373 --> 01:03:34.723
will depend on their report.

01:03:34.767 --> 01:03:37.117
And then what about
that name? Mary Smith.

01:03:37.161 --> 01:03:38.945
Will run it by the family,
and see if it rings any bells.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.426
Call me..

01:03:41.469 --> 01:03:42.557
...if you come up with anything.

01:03:44.255 --> 01:03:45.952
Sorry for your loss.

01:03:45.996 --> 01:03:47.432
Thank you.

01:04:45.272 --> 01:04:46.970
Hey, Brooke.

01:04:47.013 --> 01:04:48.493
Doin' okay?

01:04:48.536 --> 01:04:50.887
[sobbing]

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:52.149
What are you looking for?

01:04:52.192 --> 01:04:53.933
Pictures!

01:04:53.977 --> 01:04:56.066
Mom asked me if I have
pictures for the funeral.

01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:59.330
We took some at the photo booth,
and I can't find them.

01:04:59.373 --> 01:05:00.548
I need to find them.

01:05:02.159 --> 01:05:04.030
Okay, well, I mean..

01:05:04.074 --> 01:05:05.945
You have a ton of pictures
of Taylor here.

01:05:05.989 --> 01:05:09.557
- 'Could you use some of them?'
- I know they're in here.

01:05:09.601 --> 01:05:11.516
Okay, Brooke, you need to calm
down a little bit, okay, babe?

01:05:11.559 --> 01:05:13.561
Maybe we could go
and do something fun

01:05:13.605 --> 01:05:14.998
to get your mind off things.

01:05:17.217 --> 01:05:19.785
Come on. We'd go to the beach,
we could get coffee.

01:05:19.828 --> 01:05:21.526
Something to cheer you up, yeah?

01:05:21.569 --> 01:05:24.659
I don't want to be cheered up.

01:05:24.703 --> 01:05:26.835
Okay, well, there's no need
to be rude to me.

01:05:26.879 --> 01:05:28.576
It's not my fault
that your best friend drowned.

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:30.491
If anything, it's your mother's.

01:05:30.535 --> 01:05:31.666
What?

01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:33.190
Look, any responsible adult

01:05:33.233 --> 01:05:34.365
would have had a gate
around that pool.

01:05:34.408 --> 01:05:36.280
What is wrong with you?

01:05:40.762 --> 01:05:44.070
- Everything okay in here?
- Yes, darling.

01:05:44.114 --> 01:05:47.378
Brooke was just apologizing
and calming down, weren't you?

01:05:47.421 --> 01:05:51.251
Get out. Get out of my room.

01:05:51.295 --> 01:05:52.949
[Mitch]
'Let's give Brooke
her space, Tiffany.'

01:05:52.992 --> 01:05:55.386
No, she shouldn't speak
to her parents like that.

01:05:55.429 --> 01:05:57.127
You're not my parent.

01:05:58.041 --> 01:05:58.955
Tiffany.

01:06:00.826 --> 01:06:03.176
- Tiffany.
- Hmm?

01:06:05.352 --> 01:06:06.745
Of course.

01:06:10.531 --> 01:06:12.011
Come here.

01:06:12.055 --> 01:06:13.099
[dramatic music]

01:06:13.143 --> 01:06:15.014
I'm so sorry, baby.

01:06:22.239 --> 01:06:24.458
I.. I-I don't know what to say.

01:06:24.502 --> 01:06:25.851
[sniffles]

01:06:27.722 --> 01:06:30.290
Your mom is much better
at these things than I am.

01:06:32.553 --> 01:06:34.729
And Taylor was a good friend.

01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:37.558
We'll all miss her very much.

01:06:37.602 --> 01:06:38.995

01:06:45.175 --> 01:06:46.654

01:07:06.457 --> 01:07:09.329
[music continues]

01:07:26.868 --> 01:07:28.305
I can't believe that you're
gonna let her get away with...

01:07:28.348 --> 01:07:30.220
Her best friend just died.

01:07:30.263 --> 01:07:31.699
She's doing the best she can.

01:07:31.743 --> 01:07:33.658
Wow! You're going to
defend her, Mitch?

01:07:33.701 --> 01:07:35.138
She was screaming at me.

01:07:35.181 --> 01:07:36.704
She's a teenage girl, Tiffany.

01:07:36.748 --> 01:07:38.097
A little screaming
comes with the territory.

01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:39.533
So you're not gonna fix this?

01:07:39.577 --> 01:07:41.318
There's nothing to fix.

01:07:41.361 --> 01:07:42.884
Brooke is a good kid who's going
through a hard time...

01:07:42.928 --> 01:07:43.842
- There's no excuse...
- What do you...

01:07:43.885 --> 01:07:45.235
Tiffany, drop it.

01:07:45.278 --> 01:07:46.366
Brooke doesn't
need this right now

01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:47.889
and neither do I.

01:07:49.413 --> 01:07:52.155
So you're gonna
side with her over me.

01:07:52.198 --> 01:07:55.114
- Hmm?
- Brooke comes first.

01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:58.161
That'll never change.

01:08:00.772 --> 01:08:02.121
[sighs]

01:08:04.341 --> 01:08:05.559
[cell phone beeping]

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:16.917
Yes, I'd love to meet today.

01:08:16.962 --> 01:08:19.617
I know exactly where that is.

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:22.359
Great, I'll see you
in about an hour.

01:08:22.402 --> 01:08:24.011
Okay.

01:08:24.055 --> 01:08:25.710
Looking forward to it,
thank you.

[Jackie]
'So you know Mary Smith?'

01:08:34.066 --> 01:08:37.374
We were only married
for six months, and, uh..

01:08:37.417 --> 01:08:40.638
...and I haven't seen her
in a year, over a year.

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.553
What can you tell me about her?

01:08:42.595 --> 01:08:46.383
- Uh...
- If you don't mind me asking.

01:08:46.426 --> 01:08:50.169
Mary had this,
this way about her.

01:08:50.212 --> 01:08:52.606
She was intoxicating.

01:08:52.649 --> 01:08:54.478
She was well-traveled.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:57.176
Charming, was an amazing cook.

01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:59.352
I mean, she learned the
ins and outs of French cuisine

01:08:59.395 --> 01:09:00.571
while traveling abroad.

01:09:00.613 --> 01:09:03.095
Is that so?

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:06.403
And she had a wonderful
relationship with my son.

01:09:06.446 --> 01:09:09.884
- Yeah, they were very close.
- Hmm.

01:09:09.928 --> 01:09:14.019
And it was, uh, last July,
I was away on business and, uh..

01:09:16.412 --> 01:09:19.938
I got a call that
there had been a fire.

01:09:22.245 --> 01:09:24.421
My house had burned down.

01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:27.250
I lost everything.

01:09:28.947 --> 01:09:30.557
Everything.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.993
How horrible.

01:09:33.037 --> 01:09:34.822
I'm so sorry.

01:09:37.738 --> 01:09:40.828
They managed to recover
the remains of my son, but, um..

01:09:42.787 --> 01:09:45.224
...not Mary.

01:09:45.268 --> 01:09:49.140
So officially, she's listed
as a missing person.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:51.926
I still hold out hope

01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:55.103
that maybe she made it out..

01:09:55.147 --> 01:09:56.540
...she'd come home.

01:09:56.583 --> 01:09:59.543
[birds chirping]

01:09:59.586 --> 01:10:00.979

- No. I'm..

I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:10:06.854 --> 01:10:10.031
Do-do you happen to have
a picture of her?

01:10:10.075 --> 01:10:11.337
Of course.

01:10:17.474 --> 01:10:19.171
[chuckles]
'That's my Mary.'

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.478
[dramatic music]

01:10:26.396 --> 01:10:29.137
So, do you know
where I can find her?

01:10:29.181 --> 01:10:31.401
I, um..

01:10:31.444 --> 01:10:33.925
I might. I might, I, uh..

01:10:33.968 --> 01:10:35.927
I need to do
some more digging, so, so

01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:37.581
can I, can I call you tonight?

01:10:37.624 --> 01:10:39.670
- Of course.
- Thank you.

Mary.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:56.861
Excuse me, miss?

Hey, Greg.

what're you saying?'

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.370
'Is your daughter is danger?'

01:12:11.414 --> 01:12:15.113
I... I don't know,
I need you to tell me that.

01:12:15.156 --> 01:12:17.594
'Look, we're in the middle of
a homicide investigation... '

01:12:17.637 --> 01:12:19.726
- A homicide?
- 'Taylor Shipley's death.'

01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:21.119
'It wasn't an accident.'

01:12:21.162 --> 01:12:22.120
Now, we're going to need you to

01:12:22.163 --> 01:12:24.122
answer some questions.

01:12:24.165 --> 01:12:25.645

in your pool this morning..'

01:12:37.701 --> 01:12:41.226
Uh, detective, meet,
meet me at my husband's house.

01:12:41.269 --> 01:12:42.793
Miss.. Miss McClain.

01:12:43.924 --> 01:12:45.099
Come on.

01:12:53.978 --> 01:12:56.328
I want to go see mom.

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:58.025
- Did you talk to her?
- No.

01:12:58.069 --> 01:13:00.463
She's not answering
any of my calls.

I just want to go over there
and talk to her face to face.

01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:07.470
Okay. Okay.

01:13:07.513 --> 01:13:09.428
You're right,
it's probably for the best, um..

01:13:09.472 --> 01:13:10.734
I have a quick meeting
with a client

01:13:10.777 --> 01:13:12.083
then I can take you
right after, alright?

01:13:12.126 --> 01:13:13.867
Okay. Thank you.

01:13:16.957 --> 01:13:19.003
I can take you now
if you want to.

01:13:19.046 --> 01:13:21.919
That's okay.
I'd rather go with dad.

Mitch, take Brooke
and get out of the house.

01:14:33.599 --> 01:14:35.253
Don't tell Tiffany, just go.

01:14:35.296 --> 01:14:37.124
She's dangerous.
She's not who she says she is.

01:14:38.822 --> 01:14:40.214
What're you doing?

01:14:42.129 --> 01:14:44.915
- How could you?
- Brooke, I can explain.

01:14:44.958 --> 01:14:48.614
- How?
- I was trying to protect you.

01:14:48.658 --> 01:14:50.442
But it's too late now.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.970
[grunting]

01:15:17.643 --> 01:15:20.690
Brooke. Brooke.

01:15:20.733 --> 01:15:22.605
- Oh, God, what happened?
- I, I don't know.

01:15:22.648 --> 01:15:24.607
- She just collapsed.
- Did you call 911?

01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:26.260
[Tiffany]
'Of course I did.
They're on their way.'

01:15:28.349 --> 01:15:29.916
Did you do this to her?

01:15:30.917 --> 01:15:33.224
Did you do this to her?

01:15:33.267 --> 01:15:35.966
You're never gonna
let her go, are you?

01:15:36.009 --> 01:15:38.272
Come on, baby, come on.
Come on, please.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.845
Such a waste.

01:16:24.449 --> 01:16:26.059

01:16:35.416 --> 01:16:36.809
Brooke.

01:16:51.824 --> 01:16:53.696
Could have been so happy.

01:16:55.306 --> 01:16:57.525
A perfect little family.

01:17:02.661 --> 01:17:04.010

01:17:07.318 --> 01:17:09.799

01:17:36.434 --> 01:17:37.653
Brooke?

01:17:39.829 --> 01:17:41.744
You can't hide from me.

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:44.964
'Brooke?'

01:17:46.226 --> 01:17:47.837
Where are you?

01:17:50.230 --> 01:17:52.668
'You're really starting to
piss me off.'

01:17:56.019 --> 01:17:57.237
Brooke.

01:18:16.822 --> 01:18:17.997

Tiffany, please.

01:19:16.447 --> 01:19:18.057
Oh, no, baby.

01:19:18.101 --> 01:19:20.407
It's too late for that now.

01:19:20.451 --> 01:19:22.758
Such a shame
'cause it started so well.

01:19:24.107 --> 01:19:26.065
It always starts so well.

01:19:28.851 --> 01:19:29.939
You could have been
the perfect little daughter.

01:19:29.982 --> 01:19:31.201
She is.

[grunting]

01:19:32.463 --> 01:19:33.551

01:19:33.594 --> 01:19:34.770
[grunting]

01:19:37.207 --> 01:19:39.035
You stay away from her, Tiffany.

01:19:39.078 --> 01:19:40.514
Or should I call you Mary?

01:19:40.558 --> 01:19:42.690
[chuckles]

01:19:42.734 --> 01:19:45.084
Oh! Greg.

01:19:45.128 --> 01:19:48.044
He was so handsome.

01:19:48.087 --> 01:19:50.742
But he just couldn't seem to
let that little brat go.

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:53.963
They always have trouble
letting them go.

01:19:54.006 --> 01:19:56.704

Go.

01:20:09.717 --> 01:20:11.589
No, no, no, we can't leave,
dad's still inside.

01:20:11.632 --> 01:20:14.244
What? Okay.

01:20:14.287 --> 01:20:16.594
Okay. Go get help.

01:20:16.637 --> 01:20:19.945
What? What? No. You can't
go in there by yourself.

01:20:19.989 --> 01:20:21.381
Call the police.

01:20:21.425 --> 01:20:22.992
Everything is gonna be fine,
baby, okay?

01:20:23.035 --> 01:20:24.428
- Go.
- Okay.

Oh, God.

01:21:01.987 --> 01:21:03.902

- She's safe, let's go.

01:21:03.946 --> 01:21:05.686
Look out!

01:21:51.471 --> 01:21:54.126
I just wanted
the perfect family.

01:21:54.170 --> 01:21:55.823
To be the perfect mom.

01:22:00.959 --> 01:22:02.961
She already has a mom.

You think that's
enough pancakes?

01:22:49.355 --> 01:22:50.791
We always need more pancakes.

the table? I'll be right there.

Alright.

- Hey.

01:23:06.851 --> 01:23:08.461
What a surprise.

01:23:08.505 --> 01:23:10.681
Uh, yeah, Brooke left
these at my house.

01:23:10.724 --> 01:23:12.117
I just thought I'd drop 'em by.

01:23:12.161 --> 01:23:14.467
And, uh..

01:23:14.511 --> 01:23:17.166
Renata made you
some zucchini bread.

01:23:17.209 --> 01:23:19.429
Smells good in here.

01:23:19.472 --> 01:23:22.562
Yeah, I'm, I'm making
breakfast for dinner.

01:23:22.606 --> 01:23:24.695
Breakfast for dinner,
never a mistake.

01:23:26.305 --> 01:23:28.003
Did you wanna join us?

01:23:31.397 --> 01:23:32.703
That'd be nice.

01:23:34.922 --> 01:23:36.228
Look who I found.

01:23:36.272 --> 01:23:38.578
