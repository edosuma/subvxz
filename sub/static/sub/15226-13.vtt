01:24.149 --> 01:25.249
Hey, Alex.

01:25.317 --> 01:26.585
Hi, Tony.

01:26.652 --> 01:27.786
Guess what.

01:27.853 --> 01:29.454
I just joined this great
              protection group

01:29.521 --> 01:30.855
in my neighborhood, see?

01:30.923 --> 01:33.191
We patrol the streets, catch
  muggers, that kind of thing.

01:33.258 --> 01:34.325
No fooling?
                Congratulations.

01:34.393 --> 01:35.694
Yeah, man.
   Only one problem, though.

01:35.761 --> 01:36.861
They say I got
       to have a partner.

01:36.929 --> 01:38.029
They're all in teams,

01:38.097 --> 01:39.297
so they say I got to bring
            somebody in with me.

01:39.364 --> 01:40.699
I'm in.

01:40.766 --> 01:42.400
So what
do you say, Alex?

01:42.468 --> 01:43.501
Oh, me? No thanks.
No thanks, Tony.

01:43.569 --> 01:44.669
I'm sorry, no.

01:44.737 --> 01:47.806
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:47.907 --> 01:50.541
There's a person here.

01:51.877 --> 01:53.011
You mean you, Jim?

01:53.079 --> 01:56.414
Uh... Yes, I mean me.

01:56.482 --> 02:01.319
I have something to say and your
 ignoring me made me forget it!

02:03.656 --> 02:05.523
Guess I told him,
      didn't I?

02:05.591 --> 02:08.425
You sure did.

02:08.494 --> 02:10.862
I just hope he
                  had it coming.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.400
No, thanks, Tony,
sorry, no.

02:15.467 --> 02:17.535
All right.

02:17.603 --> 02:21.372
Ah, I don't know why
I'm even drinking coffee.

02:21.440 --> 02:24.175
I'm so tired, I just want
   to go home and go to bed.

02:31.183 --> 02:32.750
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
who are you? Who are you?

02:32.818 --> 02:34.485
Oh, I'm your new driver.

02:34.553 --> 02:36.554
Uh, my name is Nina Chambers.

02:36.621 --> 02:38.756
You sure you're old enough
to drive a cab?

02:38.858 --> 02:41.559
Here's my driver's license.

02:41.661 --> 02:45.830
Ah. You got a license.

02:45.898 --> 02:48.767
That puts you on our "A" list.

02:48.834 --> 02:52.137
All right, it's a busy day,
so listen up.

02:52.204 --> 02:54.572
I'll give you the whole
indoctrination right here.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.741
My name is Louie De Palma.

02:56.809 --> 02:59.177
You're gonna hear a lot
of foul things said about me

02:59.244 --> 03:01.345
by the other drivers
in this garage.

03:01.413 --> 03:04.649
Pay attention.

03:04.717 --> 03:08.052
I got my good side
and I got my bad side.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.353
Yeah, his good side is

03:09.421 --> 03:11.455
he's never bombed
    the children's hospital.

03:14.393 --> 03:16.027
You gonna listen to me

03:16.094 --> 03:19.931
or you gonna stand there
looking contemporary?

03:19.998 --> 03:21.232
Huh?

03:21.300 --> 03:24.235
Well, uh, that was just funny
        what that man just said.

03:24.303 --> 03:26.971
There are no men
and women in this garage.

03:27.039 --> 03:28.205
All right.

03:28.274 --> 03:31.809
Only hacks who ferry
frightened citizens

03:31.877 --> 03:35.747
around a diseased city.

03:35.814 --> 03:37.582
Welcome aboard.

03:40.752 --> 03:42.353
I'm Alex Reiger.
                       Hi, Nina.

03:42.421 --> 03:44.122
(distinctly):
"Nine-a, Nine-a."
                        Nina.

03:44.190 --> 03:45.656
What, did he
just quit smoking?

03:45.725 --> 03:47.859
Nah, you mean Louie?
            Nah, don't mind him.

03:47.927 --> 03:50.161
His mother dropped
                him on his head.

03:50.229 --> 03:52.163
About a week ago.

03:52.231 --> 03:54.099
All right, I'll-I'll
           introduce you around.

03:54.166 --> 03:57.101
Over here we have, uh...

03:57.136 --> 03:58.936
Well anyway,
over here...

04:00.272 --> 04:03.274
Elaine Nardo,
         Nina Chambers.
                       Hi, Nina.

04:03.342 --> 04:04.776
(distinctly):
           "Nee-na."
                       Hi, Nina.

04:04.843 --> 04:06.010
Hi, Elaine.

04:06.077 --> 04:07.278
Why don't you
                       sit down?

04:07.346 --> 04:08.680
Sure.

04:08.747 --> 04:10.682
So, you're new
                   at this, huh?

04:10.749 --> 04:11.715
My first night.

04:11.783 --> 04:13.351
And I'm looking
      forward to it, too.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.587
It should be exciting.

04:15.655 --> 04:17.988
You know,
  couples going to the movies,

04:18.057 --> 04:21.459
kids on their first date,
    anniversaries, you know,

04:21.526 --> 04:24.295
lots of happy people.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.965
This is just gonna be great,
           you know?

04:27.033 --> 04:31.336
I see you're planning on driving
     in the borough of Oz.

04:31.403 --> 04:33.737
Watch out for the Munchkins;
     they're light tippers.

04:33.805 --> 04:34.972
(chuckling)

04:35.041 --> 04:36.675
I'm going home.
 Good night.

04:36.742 --> 04:39.510
Night.

04:39.578 --> 04:41.780
He's cute,
        don't you think?

04:45.183 --> 04:46.984
I hadn't noticed.

04:47.052 --> 04:48.386
No, no, no, I'm just kidding.

04:48.454 --> 04:49.721
Yes, he's very cute.

04:49.789 --> 04:53.691
Hey, Alex, Alex, Alex,
     let me take you home.

04:53.759 --> 04:55.159
Be my first fare.

04:55.227 --> 04:56.360
Yeah, okay.

04:56.428 --> 04:58.396
Hey, Louie, give her a cab.

04:58.463 --> 05:03.134
Oh, sure, first time out,
you deserve something special.

05:03.202 --> 05:07.338
Let's see, uh,
you got cab 404.

05:07.406 --> 05:10.441
That's got no springs
and no heater.

05:10.509 --> 05:14.045
We call it
Old Whip 'n' Chill.

05:14.113 --> 05:15.179
Happy trip.

05:18.650 --> 05:20.685
Uh...
(clears throat)

05:20.752 --> 05:23.354
Excuse me, Elaine.

05:23.422 --> 05:26.590
Who's cute?

05:26.658 --> 05:28.226
You're cute, Jim.

05:28.294 --> 05:32.697
Ah... (laughs)

05:32.765 --> 05:34.398
What a kidder!

05:35.901 --> 05:39.336
What a kidder.

05:39.404 --> 05:41.038
Maybe you're right.

05:49.615 --> 05:53.317
Sometimes I use "Nee-na,"
       sometimes I use "Nine-a."

05:53.386 --> 05:54.853
Huh, I guess.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.489
I don't know, I don't like to
      get pinned down, you know?

05:57.556 --> 05:59.156
Of course, on
              stage, I really...

05:59.224 --> 06:00.392
On stage?

06:00.459 --> 06:02.326
Uh-oh.

06:02.395 --> 06:03.495
You're an actress?

06:03.562 --> 06:05.129
Oh, yeah.

06:05.197 --> 06:06.431
I've done some commercials,

06:06.499 --> 06:08.299
some bus and truck tours.

06:08.367 --> 06:10.001
You know, one show
          almost got to Broadway

06:10.069 --> 06:13.838
called <i>Stompin' and</i>
     <i>Clompin' and Cuttin' Loose.</i>

06:13.906 --> 06:15.807
(laughing)

06:15.875 --> 06:17.509
(sighing)

06:17.576 --> 06:20.211
It played one week and
               I lost 11 pounds.

06:22.013 --> 06:23.681
I did some TV, but...

06:23.748 --> 06:25.183
Yeah, every script
they send you

06:25.250 --> 06:28.886
has you saying either "jive
turkey" or "say what, sucker?"

06:28.954 --> 06:31.822
(laughing)

06:31.891 --> 06:33.758
How'd you know that?

06:35.327 --> 06:37.428
You sure are sharp, Alex.

06:37.496 --> 06:39.864
Yeah, well, listen,
right now, I sure am tired.

06:39.932 --> 06:41.933
Uh, you don't mind
if we don't talk, do you?

06:42.001 --> 06:43.667
I have this little alarm
that goes off

06:43.735 --> 06:46.704
every time I'm with someone
who's about to be enthusiastic.

06:46.772 --> 06:48.139
Uh...
                       Sure.

06:48.207 --> 06:50.208
Excuse me.
                    Go to sleep.

06:52.544 --> 06:54.645
(tires screech,
          Alex yelps)

06:54.747 --> 06:57.881
You know, uh, there's this
     audition I'm trying to get.

06:57.949 --> 07:01.185
Boy, this part is just wonderful
    and if I could just get them

07:01.253 --> 07:02.420
to see me, then I...

07:02.488 --> 07:03.821
Hey, listen, uh...

07:03.889 --> 07:05.556
I, heh...

07:05.624 --> 07:08.192
I mean, I-I-I'm really
too tired to talk,

07:08.260 --> 07:10.327
let alone participate
in a conversation

07:10.396 --> 07:15.199
with a young actress cab driver
who's about to lick the world.

07:15.267 --> 07:16.567
Excuse me.

07:16.635 --> 07:18.669
Sorry I bothered you.

07:22.107 --> 07:23.474
WOMAN:
                   Please, taxi!

07:23.542 --> 07:26.844
Oh, you've already
got a fare.

07:26.912 --> 07:28.679
Oh, he's just a driver
               I'm dropping off.

07:28.747 --> 07:30.214
Get in.

07:30.282 --> 07:31.882
WOMAN: Oh, thanks a lot,
'cause, um,

07:31.951 --> 07:34.385
I'm on the decorating committee

07:34.453 --> 07:36.054
and we're late.

07:36.121 --> 07:37.388
I'm sorry.

07:37.456 --> 07:40.491
Sorry's no good when
       there's no Eiffel Tower.

07:46.131 --> 07:48.065
Where am I...?
     Excuse me, I'm sorry.

07:52.504 --> 07:53.738
Who are we?

07:53.806 --> 07:56.274
It just started
                  raining, Alex,

07:56.341 --> 07:59.277
and I couldn't let them
            just wait out there.

07:59.344 --> 08:00.578
Oh.

08:00.646 --> 08:01.879
Hey, mister.

08:01.947 --> 08:03.114
Yeah?

08:03.182 --> 08:06.050
We're 16
and we're in love,

08:06.118 --> 08:08.653
so could you please
do us a favor?

08:08.721 --> 08:10.254
Yeah. What?

08:10.322 --> 08:11.723
Buy us liquor?

08:14.793 --> 08:16.895
I would, but I
                  forgot my I.D.

08:16.929 --> 08:18.596
(laughing)

08:18.664 --> 08:20.564
Hey, I-I live here.

08:23.101 --> 08:24.569
Excuse me.

08:24.636 --> 08:28.339
Listen, Alex, I really enjoyed
    having you as my first fare.

08:28.407 --> 08:32.109
Yeah, we really enjoyed it,
     too, didn't we, gang?

08:32.177 --> 08:34.445
Nee-na/Nine-a's
     Magical Mystery Tour.

08:34.513 --> 08:35.946
Excuse me.

08:36.014 --> 08:37.248
Hey, hey, Alex?
         Yeah.

08:37.316 --> 08:38.616
Can I talk to you
                   for a second?

08:38.683 --> 08:40.083
Huh?
                        Up here?

08:40.150 --> 08:42.553
Okay.

08:47.026 --> 08:50.427
Hey, Alex, uh, you want to go
 somewhere after I get off work?

08:50.495 --> 08:51.695
What?

08:51.763 --> 08:55.266
She's asking you
          for a date.

08:55.333 --> 08:57.134
Hey, that's really very nice,
       but, uh, I, uh...

08:57.202 --> 08:58.803
What about it?

08:58.871 --> 09:00.004
Uh, thank you, no.
           I'm sorry.

09:00.072 --> 09:02.673
(guy and girl
      in backseat moaning)

09:02.741 --> 09:03.874
How come?

09:03.942 --> 09:06.677
Well, when caught off guard,
I usually say no.

09:06.745 --> 09:09.980
Well, next time, you won't
            be caught off guard.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.850
GUY & GIRL:
              Ooh!

09:12.918 --> 09:14.785
Can we talk about this
in the garage tomorrow?

09:14.853 --> 09:16.720
Great, great!

09:16.788 --> 09:18.890
Listen, Alex, I really
            enjoyed meeting you.

09:18.957 --> 09:20.525
Take care of yourself, huh?

09:20.592 --> 09:22.426
Yeah, right.
Um, good night.

09:22.494 --> 09:23.961
Good night.

09:24.029 --> 09:27.431
I'm glad we got rid of
Captain Bummer.

09:27.499 --> 09:31.368
If you had a car, we wouldn't
    have to go through this.

09:31.436 --> 09:36.240
If I had a car,
I would have asked Wendy.

09:39.979 --> 09:42.947
Mr. De Palma?
      I've got a problem.

09:43.014 --> 09:44.549
Oh, great!

09:44.616 --> 09:46.217
A rookie with a problem.

09:46.285 --> 09:47.819
Geez.

09:47.886 --> 09:49.553
Your envelope wasn't big enough
       for all the money,

09:49.621 --> 09:51.355
so I had to use one of mine.

09:51.422 --> 09:52.923
You think
  that's against regulations?

09:56.761 --> 09:59.130
Is this a rib?

10:03.502 --> 10:06.236
I've never said this
before, miss,

10:06.304 --> 10:08.139
but wacka, wacka, wacka!

10:11.810 --> 10:14.679
If you do this
      again tomorrow...

10:14.747 --> 10:16.948
you can go
 into the lost and found

10:17.016 --> 10:19.483
and take anything you want.

10:23.354 --> 10:25.923
We got matching shoes
in there.

10:30.529 --> 10:31.962
Hi, Alex.
Hi.

10:32.030 --> 10:33.330
Sorry I kept you waiting,

10:33.398 --> 10:36.099
but it's so easy to
           make money, you know?

10:36.167 --> 10:38.836
Yeah, the usual
cab driver's complaint.

10:38.904 --> 10:41.505
You know, listen,
                   I feel great!

10:41.573 --> 10:42.807
Let's go out!

10:44.443 --> 10:45.709
Did we have plans?

10:45.777 --> 10:47.545
You aren't tired again, are you?

10:47.613 --> 10:49.647
I don't know what it is.

10:49.714 --> 10:51.949
I think I have to see a doctor.

10:52.017 --> 10:55.353
I'm always tired
     after a 12-hour shift.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.089
I'm sorry, Nina, but I think
 I'm going to have to beg off.

10:58.156 --> 10:59.623
But the best thing
              for your tiredness

10:59.691 --> 11:02.626
is to go out and
                  have some fun.

11:02.694 --> 11:03.927
Uh, look, Nina, um...

11:03.996 --> 11:06.597
I don't date very much,
       and even if I did,

11:06.664 --> 11:08.499
I'd have a hard time
      keeping up with you.

11:08.566 --> 11:10.601
And you'd have a hard time
     keeping down with me.

11:10.668 --> 11:12.003
So, if you don't mind, uh,

11:12.070 --> 11:14.338
I don't think it's a good idea
         if we go out.

11:16.274 --> 11:18.843
Oh.

11:18.910 --> 11:21.479
Well, I... I-I hear
             what you're saying.

11:21.546 --> 11:23.481
Okay.

11:28.253 --> 11:31.321
But I'm not listening.

11:35.227 --> 11:36.560
Reiger.

11:36.628 --> 11:37.594
Hm?

11:37.663 --> 11:39.596
(disgusted groan)

11:42.300 --> 11:44.434
Listen to me.

11:48.273 --> 11:50.574
I'm a street guy.

11:50.641 --> 11:52.443
I was raised...

11:52.511 --> 11:55.212
by Old World people.

11:55.280 --> 11:58.049
But for the first
                time in my life,

11:58.116 --> 12:00.150
I'm free of prejudice.

12:00.218 --> 12:02.886
I endorse this relationship

12:02.888 --> 12:05.189
between the two of you...

12:05.257 --> 12:09.526
despite the obvious problems.

12:09.594 --> 12:12.296
What obvious problems?

12:14.366 --> 12:17.167
Well, suppose you go out.

12:17.235 --> 12:19.303
You fall in love.

12:19.371 --> 12:21.305
You get married.

12:21.373 --> 12:22.806
Hmm?

12:22.875 --> 12:25.610
What if you had kids?

12:25.677 --> 12:28.112
With her skinny body
         and your nose,

12:28.180 --> 12:30.747
they'd spend their whole lives
    falling on their faces.

12:30.815 --> 12:32.450
(honking)

12:33.918 --> 12:35.719
(honking)

12:38.156 --> 12:39.523
(honking)

12:49.600 --> 12:51.035
I got a problem.

12:51.102 --> 12:53.804
How do you stop somebody
from brightening up your life?

12:53.871 --> 12:55.339
(laughs)

12:55.407 --> 12:59.109
She left these tied to the cab
door handle with a note saying,

12:59.177 --> 13:01.278
"It's about time
    you started cheering up.

13:01.346 --> 13:02.646
I'll be helpful."

13:02.714 --> 13:03.881
Aw...

13:03.949 --> 13:06.450
Apparently,
    she's attracted to you.

13:06.518 --> 13:09.086
Oh, that's why she wrote
 in the dirt on my windshield:

13:09.153 --> 13:11.789
"My heart belongs to Cabbie."
                        (laughs)

13:11.824 --> 13:13.257
So clean your
                     windshield.

13:13.325 --> 13:16.060
You know, this has been
going on for a whole week!

13:16.127 --> 13:19.230
You know, this'll be
the first day she didn't
send me flowers...

13:19.298 --> 13:21.098
if those are for you.

13:21.166 --> 13:23.367
I should be so lucky.

13:23.434 --> 13:26.503
"Do you know how sweet you look
  with balloons in your ha..."

13:26.571 --> 13:28.105
Oh, come on...
       (muttering)

13:28.173 --> 13:29.540
Look at this here!

13:29.641 --> 13:31.909
I wish I had the self-confidence
       to be that direct.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.111
Yeah? Well, not everybody
can be like that.

13:34.179 --> 13:36.280
There's not enough
helium in this world.

13:38.283 --> 13:39.683
No!

13:39.750 --> 13:41.885
Oh, that's all right--
sometime they'll come back down

13:41.953 --> 13:44.221
and brighten up an otherwise
     dull day around here.

13:44.289 --> 13:46.323
So why don't you
           just go out with her?

13:46.391 --> 13:48.459
I'm not interested.
                           Why?

13:48.526 --> 13:51.362
Why?! Well, going past
   the difference in our age

13:51.429 --> 13:53.664
and going past
   the difference in our race

13:53.732 --> 13:56.500
and going past the difference
in our attitudes and interests

13:56.535 --> 13:57.801
and metabolisms,

13:57.869 --> 13:59.770
and the fact that
people who work together

13:59.838 --> 14:01.371
shouldn't get involved
with each other...

14:01.439 --> 14:03.574
Sure.
and the fact that
she's a crazy little actress

14:03.642 --> 14:06.209
who likes to sing in her cab
and wears ditsy clothes

14:06.277 --> 14:09.380
and has a view of the world
shared only by Jiminy Cricket...

14:09.448 --> 14:11.615
I mean, going past all that
and getting down

14:11.683 --> 14:14.452
to the real heart of the
matter-- I don't like her.

14:14.519 --> 14:16.053
Oh, come on, big fella,

14:16.120 --> 14:18.522
I know that you don't
                 go on like this
I don't like her.

14:18.590 --> 14:20.791
about anything unless
          you have a connection.

14:20.859 --> 14:23.928
Oh, well, then I just
     won't go on about her.

14:23.995 --> 14:27.464
I have absolutely no need
to go on about it.

14:27.499 --> 14:30.167
Oh, don't look at me
like that, Elaine.

14:30.234 --> 14:31.502
And what's more...

14:31.570 --> 14:34.771
Look, the last thing
I need in my life

14:34.839 --> 14:36.440
is a born-again cheerleader

14:36.508 --> 14:39.743
who's gonna try to kick
some life into the old boy.

14:39.810 --> 14:42.879
She thinks if you treat people
right, they'll treat you right.

14:42.947 --> 14:46.316
She's like every actress
   or Hindu that I ever met.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.519
She has karma,
      she's high on life,

14:48.587 --> 14:51.822
she's positive,
    hard-working, joyful...

14:51.890 --> 14:53.691
and I don't like her!

14:53.759 --> 14:54.925
Hey, Louie!

14:54.993 --> 14:55.959
What?

14:56.027 --> 14:57.328
She's coming.

14:57.395 --> 15:01.298
Oh, no, this has become my
least favorite part of the day.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.601
Another big-money night?

15:04.669 --> 15:05.903
(coins clinking)
(giddy cackling)

15:10.475 --> 15:11.408
Let me see.

15:11.476 --> 15:12.442
(coins clink)

15:12.510 --> 15:15.913
Oh! Nina, I gotta
                  tell you this.

15:15.981 --> 15:17.781
I'm not a
                sentimental man,

15:17.849 --> 15:21.218
but each day when I
        look into this envelope,

15:21.285 --> 15:23.787
I get all misty.

15:23.855 --> 15:27.123
And I love the way you light up
     when I come in, Louie.

15:27.191 --> 15:29.626
She loves me!
                    (laughing)

15:29.694 --> 15:31.495
Before you two start pouring
   champagne over each other,

15:31.563 --> 15:32.929
I want to talk to you.

15:32.997 --> 15:33.798
Come here for a second.

15:33.865 --> 15:35.565
No, I just wanna talk
            to you for a second.

15:35.633 --> 15:37.034
Listen, Alex, I can't
talk right now.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.769
I got the audition
for that part.

15:38.837 --> 15:39.836
They're finally seeing me.

15:39.904 --> 15:42.139
But...
But if you like,
we could talk later.

15:42.207 --> 15:44.208
You gonna be home
around 7:00?
                        Yeah.

15:44.242 --> 15:46.143
I'll come by.
                           Okay.

15:46.211 --> 15:47.411
Okay!

15:47.478 --> 15:48.578
No, uh, no, no.

15:48.647 --> 15:51.014
(grunts)

15:52.017 --> 15:55.018
Well, it's better
on my turf.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.620
Right.

15:56.687 --> 15:59.590
I mean, I've been too nice
      about it, haven't I?

15:59.657 --> 16:01.758
I'm not gonna worry about
 hurting her feelings anymore.

16:01.826 --> 16:02.926
I mean, I've had it!

16:02.995 --> 16:04.628
If she doesn't understand,

16:04.695 --> 16:07.697
you can explain it over
   a weekend in Connecticut.

16:18.509 --> 16:20.410
(knocking on door)

16:23.648 --> 16:24.614
Alex?
                     Yeah.

16:24.682 --> 16:25.815
I think I got the part.

16:25.884 --> 16:27.284
I think I got the part,
Alex.

16:27.351 --> 16:28.451
I really do.

16:28.519 --> 16:30.453
It was the best audition
                    I ever gave!

16:30.521 --> 16:31.822
Great.

16:31.889 --> 16:33.990
You really are a cure
                   for euphoria.

16:34.058 --> 16:35.458
Now, look, I'm very pleased
about your news,

16:35.526 --> 16:36.993
but I have something
to talk to you about.

16:37.061 --> 16:38.628
Now sit down,
                         please.
Alex, I hope
you don't mind.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.898
I gave them your number.
They're gonna call.
                     Yeah, okay.

16:40.999 --> 16:41.799
They haven't called yet,
have they?
                  No!

16:41.867 --> 16:43.133
Look...
You haven't been
on the phone,

16:43.234 --> 16:44.401
have you?
           No, look, Nina, would
                     you just...

16:44.469 --> 16:45.735
Is your phone working?
             What are you doing?

16:45.803 --> 16:47.404
No, they might be trying
     to call me right now.

16:47.472 --> 16:49.039
Nina, would you please
                       sit down?

16:49.908 --> 16:52.510
Alex, I cannot
sit still.

16:52.577 --> 16:56.680
Talk to me if you want to,
but I cannot sit still.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.751
What does it take
to get you excited?

17:00.819 --> 17:02.586
I would get excited
            if you got the part.

17:02.687 --> 17:03.887
I think I've gotten
the part.

17:03.955 --> 17:05.422
Oh, don't be
                     ridiculous!

17:05.490 --> 17:07.458
Until you get the phone call,
            how can you be sure?
Because

17:07.525 --> 17:08.959
I overheard the playwright

17:09.027 --> 17:10.461
say to the composer
     that "she's perfect,"

17:10.494 --> 17:13.229
and the-- and the composer said,
"She sings like an angel,"

17:13.297 --> 17:15.132
and the stage doorman--

17:15.200 --> 17:16.834
oh, the stage doorman,

17:16.901 --> 17:19.636
he says, "I knew you were
     gonna get that part,"

17:19.671 --> 17:23.240
and-and-and the director
   kissed me on both cheeks,

17:23.308 --> 17:24.808
like they do in Europe,

17:24.876 --> 17:26.542
and he says,

17:26.611 --> 17:28.311
"I've never been so moved

17:28.380 --> 17:31.815
since Judy Garland re-opened
                 at the Palace."

17:31.883 --> 17:34.818
They're talking to my agents
                right now, Alex.

17:34.886 --> 17:36.320
And, if that's
                     not enough,

17:36.388 --> 17:39.323
I've got a funny feeling
         creeping up my left leg

17:39.391 --> 17:42.493
that tells me something
            good is gonna happen
                    to me today.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.396
So what do you think?

17:46.331 --> 17:49.132
Sounds like a good audition.

17:49.200 --> 17:49.967
Yeah?

17:50.101 --> 17:51.702
You-You really
                       think so?

17:51.770 --> 17:52.803
(phone ringing)

17:52.871 --> 17:54.838
(screams, laughs)

17:55.840 --> 17:57.240
Hello.

17:57.308 --> 17:58.309
Yes, she is.

17:58.376 --> 18:00.076
Well, I'll see.

18:00.144 --> 18:01.244
Are you in?

18:01.279 --> 18:02.879
(gasps)

18:02.947 --> 18:04.080
Stand back, Alex.

18:04.149 --> 18:06.049
I'm gonna need a little
        freakin' space!

18:06.184 --> 18:07.551
(giggles)

18:07.686 --> 18:08.752
Hello.

18:18.563 --> 18:20.497
Oh...

18:23.401 --> 18:25.335
Oh... okay.

18:27.072 --> 18:30.007
Thanks, thanks, Paulie.

18:35.580 --> 18:38.515
They said I was too right
            for it.

18:40.752 --> 18:43.687
Too... Too on the nose.

18:45.957 --> 18:47.557
Too <i>right</i> for it?!

18:47.659 --> 18:50.927
They said they adored my acting,

18:50.996 --> 18:53.663
and my-my dancing,

18:53.731 --> 18:55.832
and my singing.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.702
It's just me they didn't like.

19:00.271 --> 19:03.173
Oh, no, hey, listen, uh...
         hey, come on,

19:03.274 --> 19:05.175
you know, like-like--
I mean, uh,

19:05.210 --> 19:07.711
hey, listen,
you know...
                 (crying)

19:07.779 --> 19:09.113
Well, come on,
it-it...

19:09.180 --> 19:12.316
Why do I make myself
                       so crazy,

19:12.384 --> 19:14.818
and get my hopes up
so high?

19:14.886 --> 19:16.820
Hey, come on, if you
            believe in yourself,

19:16.888 --> 19:19.790
you're gonna make it!

19:19.857 --> 19:21.858
You were right
all along, Alex.

19:21.926 --> 19:23.927
No, Nina, I wasn't.

19:24.029 --> 19:25.962
I wasn't.

19:26.031 --> 19:28.832
Don't-Don't try
to make me feel better.

19:28.934 --> 19:30.734
Oh, don't worry.

19:30.835 --> 19:32.736
I probably won't come close.

19:34.806 --> 19:38.041
Hey, Nina, I know this must feel

19:38.109 --> 19:41.044
like the worst night
      of your life, but...

19:41.112 --> 19:44.047
hey, come on, just between
   the two of us, no kidding,

19:44.115 --> 19:46.717
isn't it great
       you almost got it?

19:46.784 --> 19:48.485
Huh?

19:48.553 --> 19:51.021
You almost got
                       the part.

19:51.089 --> 19:52.923
You're 25 years old.

19:52.991 --> 19:55.926
You nearly got the lead
      in a Broadway show.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.595
You're blessed and you're lucky,

19:58.663 --> 20:01.565
because you get to have a broken
heart over something that good.

20:01.633 --> 20:05.336
The last broken heart I had was
  when the Jets didn't cover.

20:05.436 --> 20:07.271
(laughs)

20:11.342 --> 20:13.576
(both laugh)

20:18.149 --> 20:21.284
You really are
somethin'.

20:25.456 --> 20:27.424
So...

20:27.492 --> 20:30.160
what was it you wanted
      to talk to me about?

20:30.262 --> 20:32.028
Nah, it's, uh...

20:32.097 --> 20:33.430
Oh...

20:33.498 --> 20:35.799
you wanted to ask me

20:35.867 --> 20:38.601
to stop bothering you, right?

20:39.504 --> 20:41.405
Look, Nina, Nina...

20:41.472 --> 20:43.941
the basic problem between us

20:44.008 --> 20:45.943
is that you're looking
           for magic,

20:46.010 --> 20:48.612
and believe me,
  from the bottom of my heart,

20:48.680 --> 20:50.614
look at me,

20:50.682 --> 20:52.616
I'm a no-magic man.

21:00.925 --> 21:03.594
(gentle laugh)

21:03.662 --> 21:05.696
I'm going home.

21:07.732 --> 21:09.666
Kiss me good night?

21:09.734 --> 21:12.402
Sure.

21:28.086 --> 21:30.020
Boy...

21:30.088 --> 21:33.056
you sure are smart.

21:33.124 --> 21:35.792
You said no magic,

21:35.860 --> 21:37.928
and darned
if it ain't so!

21:39.297 --> 21:41.397
Alex, thanks for helping me out
         this evening.

21:41.465 --> 21:43.333
I really appreciate it, huh?

21:43.335 --> 21:44.168
Thanks a whole lot.
                 What?

21:44.235 --> 21:45.502
You're wonderful.
       Hey, hey, no, hey.

21:45.569 --> 21:46.536
Look, look...
I'll see ya later,
huh?

21:46.604 --> 21:48.505
Do you want a cup of
                coffee-- I mean,
  Ciao.

21:48.573 --> 21:50.174
don't you want to talk
                    or anything?

21:50.241 --> 21:52.809
I mean, you gotta have
          some problems and want
               to talk about it,

21:52.877 --> 21:54.244
I'm really good
                  with problems.
I'm all right,

21:54.312 --> 21:55.946
I'm all right, really.
Don't worry about me.

21:56.014 --> 21:57.347
We could have dinner.
            You know, I-I was...

21:57.415 --> 21:59.883
Alex, you've helped me
plenty already.

21:59.951 --> 22:01.551
Oh, I can help you
                 more than that.
Oh... no.

22:01.619 --> 22:03.019
You've got a lot more
             problems than that.
I'm fine.

22:03.087 --> 22:04.421
No, I mean it.
    I'm fine.

22:04.522 --> 22:06.256
I'm fine.

22:06.324 --> 22:08.091
Oh, good.
                     Yeah, okay.

22:08.159 --> 22:09.927
See ya.

22:09.994 --> 22:11.929
Yeah, I'll see ya.

22:22.807 --> 22:25.342
(theme song playing)

22:48.466 --> 22:49.867
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

22:49.934 --> 22:51.268
(man grumbling)

22:52.305 --> 22:58.236
