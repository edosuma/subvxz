01:55.366 --> 01:57.911
This has been
a long time coming, fellas.

01:58.119 --> 01:59.913
Three years
on the plates alone.

02:00.121 --> 02:02.207
I think you'll find
the product worth the wait.

02:02.415 --> 02:04.834
Go ahead.
Take a good look.

02:06.044 --> 02:08.922
Jeez, Mr. Sol, I can't
tell the difference.

02:09.130 --> 02:11.424
You'd need one of them
neutron microscopes,
Palmer.

02:11.633 --> 02:13.718
It's identical down to
Ben Franklin's stubble.

02:13.927 --> 02:14.803
I want it laundered
through the casino

02:15.011 --> 02:15.762

02:16.304 --> 02:17.347
Three-quarter mil by march.

02:17.555 --> 02:18.932
Anybody got
a problem with that?

02:20.350 --> 02:21.976
- Hey!
- Hey!
- The bat!

02:23.186 --> 02:24.979
Jeez! Get him!

02:50.880 --> 02:53.341
[Groaning]

03:04.727 --> 03:06.771
Chuckie Sol.

03:06.938 --> 03:09.816

03:23.538 --> 03:26.749
Who--who are you?
What do you want?

03:26.916 --> 03:30.170
I want you, Chuckie boy.

[Brakes screech]

03:52.192 --> 03:53.109
Aah!

03:53.318 --> 03:54.235
Aah!

04:11.544 --> 04:14.631
This time I got you,
you lousy, stinking--

04:15.256 --> 04:16.173
what?

04:34.025 --> 04:35.235
- Look at that.
- Lord.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.278
Look!
It's Batman!

04:37.487 --> 04:38.196
Where?

04:38.404 --> 04:39.113
- Yeah.
- Up there.

04:39.322 --> 04:40.156
Oh, my God.

05:00.176 --> 05:01.552
I'm telling you, friends,

05:01.719 --> 05:03.721
it's vigilantism
at its deadliest.

05:03.930 --> 05:07.684
How many times will we let
Batman cross the line?

05:07.892 --> 05:09.018
I'm sorry, councilman,

05:09.227 --> 05:10.520
but you can't
blame Batman

05:10.728 --> 05:12.021
for what happened
to Sol.

05:12.230 --> 05:14.774
Why not? He's
a loose Cannon,
Commissioner.

05:14.983 --> 05:16.276
It's not just
my opinion.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.945
A lot of people,
including
the police,

05:19.153 --> 05:20.280
think
Batman's as unstable

05:20.488 --> 05:21.864
as the crooks
he brings in.

05:22.073 --> 05:24.200
What kind of city
are we running

05:24.409 --> 05:25.535
<i>when we depend
upon the support</i>

05:25.743 --> 05:27.495

05:30.081 --> 05:31.541
Such rot, Sir.

05:31.749 --> 05:34.043
Why, you're the very
model of sanity.

05:34.252 --> 05:36.462
By the way, I've
pressed your tights

05:36.671 --> 05:38.798
and put away your
exploding gas balls.

05:39.007 --> 05:40.550
Thank you, Alfred.

05:41.926 --> 05:44.304
Might one inquire
what this is?

05:44.512 --> 05:46.139
A piece of windshield

05:46.347 --> 05:48.224
from Chuckie Sol's car.

05:50.977 --> 05:52.937
There's a chemical
residue on it--

05:53.146 --> 05:55.898
some kind
of dense long-chain
macromolecular polymer.

05:56.107 --> 05:57.817
Adapt-o-genic, of course.

05:58.026 --> 06:00.069
Of course. Ahem.

06:03.448 --> 06:05.700
I should be
landing any minute.

06:05.908 --> 06:07.618
It'll be good
to see you again,
Arthur.

06:07.827 --> 06:10.079
You, too. And don't
worry about a thing.

06:10.288 --> 06:12.290
We'll clear up
these family finances.

06:12.498 --> 06:16.377
Don't forget, you've got
a big-time city councilman
on your side.

06:16.586 --> 06:18.880
I can't believe
it's been 10 years.

06:19.088 --> 06:21.883
Thinking of...
Looking up
some old friends?

06:22.091 --> 06:24.719
Oh, Arthur, don't
start that again.

06:24.927 --> 06:26.220
He's...

06:26.429 --> 06:27.764
Ancient history.

06:27.972 --> 06:29.432
That's encouraging.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.184
I'll see you soon.

06:49.035 --> 06:50.411
Oh, come on,
Bruce--

06:50.620 --> 06:52.914
all alone
in this
big mansion--

06:53.122 --> 06:55.083
haven't you
ever thought
about marriage?

06:55.291 --> 06:56.584
Even once?

06:56.793 --> 06:59.587
Never say the "M" word
in front of Bruce.

06:59.796 --> 07:01.255
It makes him nervous.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.424
What about
the "I" word?

07:03.633 --> 07:04.842
The "I" word?

07:05.051 --> 07:06.803
Ingagement.

07:07.011 --> 07:09.889
I'd watch out for Bruce
if I were you.

07:10.098 --> 07:11.891
First he wines
and dines you,

07:12.100 --> 07:13.726
makes you think
you're the only woman

07:13.935 --> 07:15.478
he's ever been
interested in,

07:15.686 --> 07:17.230
and just
when you're wondering

07:17.438 --> 07:18.731
where to register
the China,

07:18.940 --> 07:21.234
he forgets
your phone number.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.907
Excuse me.

07:28.116 --> 07:29.909
Oh,
it's awful.

07:30.118 --> 07:31.244
Bruce. Bruce.

07:31.452 --> 07:32.954
A friend in need?

07:33.162 --> 07:34.455
Councilman.

07:34.664 --> 07:36.624
So how goes
the bat bashing?

07:36.833 --> 07:38.251
Better than
your love life.

07:38.835 --> 07:40.878
It's almost
as if you pick them

07:41.087 --> 07:42.922
because there's no chance
for a serious relationship.

07:43.131 --> 07:44.715
At least
since that one girl.

07:44.924 --> 07:46.050
What was her name?

07:46.259 --> 07:48.719
Anne? Andi? Andrea?

07:48.928 --> 07:51.055
Yes. Andrea Beaumont.

07:51.264 --> 07:53.057
Now, there was
a sweet number.

07:53.266 --> 07:55.393
How did you
let her get loose?

07:55.601 --> 07:57.395
Thanks for the
handkerchief, Arthur.

07:57.603 --> 07:59.814
You know
where you can stick it.

08:41.230 --> 08:42.607
Ha ha! That's right.

08:42.815 --> 08:44.942
And if daddy gets
any more protective,

08:45.151 --> 08:47.278
he'll build a moat
around my bedroom.

08:47.487 --> 08:50.615
It's times like this

around to--

I thought you were
saying something--

08:55.286 --> 08:56.746
well, to me, I mean.

08:56.954 --> 08:57.997
No.

08:59.123 --> 09:00.416
O.K.

09:02.835 --> 09:03.753

09:03.961 --> 09:05.087
Bruce Wayne.

09:05.296 --> 09:07.340
You know,
Wayne enterprises.

09:07.548 --> 09:08.841
I've seen him on campus.

09:09.050 --> 09:11.844
Very moody.
Cute, though.

09:12.011 --> 09:12.845
Yes?

09:13.054 --> 09:14.680
I heard my name.
I thought--

09:14.889 --> 09:16.516
who are you
talking to?

09:16.724 --> 09:17.767
My mother.

09:19.477 --> 09:21.354
Oh. Well,
I didn't mean to--

09:21.562 --> 09:23.189
that's O.K. We're done.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.608

to say today.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.110

09:28.319 --> 09:30.112

loved ones.

09:30.321 --> 09:31.531
I didn't say anything.

09:36.577 --> 09:39.455
It's just when I
talk to her out loud,

09:39.664 --> 09:41.290
I can imagine
how she'd reply.

09:41.499 --> 09:43.709
I can hear her,
like she's right there.

09:44.335 --> 09:46.295
I talked to my parents.

09:46.504 --> 09:47.547
What did you say?

09:47.755 --> 09:48.881
I made a vow.

09:49.090 --> 09:49.882
What vow?

09:50.091 --> 09:51.384
A secret one.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.886
Ooh. A man
of mystery.

09:54.095 --> 09:56.639

kept your vow?

to jump off a cliff?

14:09.141 --> 14:12.102
Sorry, Alfred, but
the plan is working.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.730
I had the edge.
I could feel it.

There was only
one thing wrong--

they weren't
afraid of me.

fear in them.

It's been three days

you were dead.

What do you mean?
You have to go after him!

19:58.532 --> 20:00.993
He didn't do it.
It's garbage,
Mr. Reeves.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.120
The Batman does not
kill, period.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.206
You want him? You get him.

20:06.415 --> 20:08.083
I'll have no part of it.

20:08.709 --> 20:09.960
Well, gentlemen?

20:11.336 --> 20:13.297
Any ideas?

20:19.845 --> 20:23.307
Hmm. He's usually
here by now.

20:35.527 --> 20:37.070
There appears to be

20:37.279 --> 20:39.072
some chemical residue
on the lawn.

20:39.281 --> 20:42.075
Could match the traces
I found on the glass.

20:42.284 --> 20:45.329
Not much, but it's
been that kind of day.

21:05.766 --> 21:08.352
You'd think they could
afford a weed eater.

21:10.354 --> 21:13.690
Sorry, mom, but the whole
world's going to seed.

21:15.525 --> 21:16.902
[Gasp]

21:17.110 --> 21:18.237
Oh...

21:19.196 --> 21:20.489
You.

21:30.874 --> 21:31.959
Bruce?

21:39.925 --> 21:42.803
I'm having the banker
cut through some red tape.

21:43.011 --> 21:44.554
He can roll your money

21:44.763 --> 21:46.056
into a higher yield
account.

21:46.265 --> 21:48.141
Amount? What--
what--what amount?

21:48.350 --> 21:49.476
I said account.

21:49.685 --> 21:52.980
Oh, I'm sorry. I was
just...Reminiscing.

21:53.188 --> 21:54.189
Hey, that's O.K.

21:54.398 --> 21:56.692
You must have
a lot on your mind.

21:56.900 --> 21:57.776
Monsieur?

22:07.411 --> 22:08.620
Remember this place?

22:08.829 --> 22:09.788
Sure.

22:09.997 --> 22:12.457
You, me, and daddy
came here all the time.

22:12.666 --> 22:13.959
How is the old guy?

22:14.167 --> 22:15.460
You're still close,
aren't you?

22:15.669 --> 22:16.753
Closer than ever.

22:16.962 --> 22:19.256
I'm sorry he couldn't
make it to town,

22:19.423 --> 22:20.757
but then,
I've always wished

22:20.966 --> 22:23.176
I could have some time
alone with you.

22:24.303 --> 22:27.431
Well, who knows what
the future might bring?

22:44.531 --> 22:47.409
<i>Welcome to the Gotham
world's fair--</i>

22:47.617 --> 22:49.077
<i>a dream of the future,</i>

22:49.286 --> 22:50.412
<i>a bright tomorrow</i>

22:50.620 --> 22:53.915
<i>filled with hope and
promise for all mankind.</i>

22:54.124 --> 22:57.336
<i>This is a vision
of a shimmering utopia,</i>

22:57.544 --> 23:00.672
<i>where we shall all spend
the rest of our lives.</i>

23:04.217 --> 23:05.510
- Did not!
- Give it back!

23:36.625 --> 23:38.835
Do you think
we'll really see this

23:39.044 --> 23:40.170
in our lifetime?

23:40.379 --> 23:41.296
Oh...

23:46.927 --> 23:47.886
Bruce?

23:48.095 --> 23:49.888
Bruce,
I'm talking to you.

23:50.722 --> 23:52.641
Huh? Oh.
I'm sorry, Andi.

23:52.849 --> 23:54.684
My mind was
on something else.

23:54.893 --> 23:56.019
Like what?

23:56.186 --> 23:58.230
Oh, just, you know,
the future.

23:58.438 --> 23:59.731
Anyone's in particular

23:59.940 --> 24:02.067
or just
the generic brand?

24:02.275 --> 24:03.568
You know.

24:03.777 --> 24:04.903
No, I don't.

24:05.112 --> 24:07.906
Since when do you talk
to me about your plans?

24:08.115 --> 24:10.325
By the way, dad's been
wanting to meet you.

24:10.534 --> 24:11.493
Oh, yeah?

24:11.701 --> 24:13.995
I said you're
not up to it yet.

24:14.204 --> 24:15.163
I can meet him.

24:15.372 --> 24:16.998
Great.

24:17.207 --> 24:18.917
I'll call him
right now.

24:21.795 --> 24:23.213
You sure about this?

24:23.422 --> 24:25.215
Sure, I'm sure.

24:25.424 --> 24:27.217
What the heck
am I doing?

24:27.426 --> 24:28.552
This isn't the plan.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.387
I must be
going nuts.

24:30.595 --> 24:32.889
If I may make so bold,
master Bruce,

24:33.098 --> 24:34.474
I'd say
quite the reverse.

24:35.767 --> 24:37.310
Excuse me, Mr. Beaumont.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.020
Here are
the partnership papers.

24:39.229 --> 24:41.273
If you could just
go over them.

24:41.481 --> 24:43.525
Knock, knock.

24:43.733 --> 24:45.444
Andi.

24:45.652 --> 24:48.613
Well, this is a most
pleasant interruption.

24:48.822 --> 24:51.116
At last I meet
the elusive Bruce Wayne.

24:51.283 --> 24:52.617
Nice to meet you, Sir.

24:52.826 --> 24:55.287
Sir? Oh, don't be
so formal, Bruce.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.622
Andrea's told me
so much about you,

24:57.831 --> 24:58.957
we're practically
family.

24:59.166 --> 24:59.958
Daddy.

25:00.167 --> 25:00.959
Ahem.

25:01.168 --> 25:02.878
Don't mind me.
I was leaving.

25:03.086 --> 25:04.379
Oh. I'm sorry.

25:04.588 --> 25:05.714
This is Arthur Reeves,

25:05.922 --> 25:08.216
a hot young Turk
from my legal department.

25:08.425 --> 25:10.218
He's someone
you should know.

25:18.351 --> 25:19.936
I hope we're
not interrupting
anything.

25:20.145 --> 25:22.272
Not at all.
I'm never too busy

25:22.481 --> 25:23.815
for Andi
and her friends.

25:24.024 --> 25:25.150
I tell you, Bruce,

25:25.358 --> 25:27.486
I do a lot
of financial planning.

25:27.694 --> 25:28.612
When it comes to money,

25:28.820 --> 25:30.447
you can't take
the future for granted.

25:30.739 --> 25:32.157
But money means little

25:32.365 --> 25:34.534
without loved ones
to share it with.

25:34.743 --> 25:36.995
Nothing's more important
than family.

25:37.204 --> 25:38.622
Yes, Mr. Beaumont.

25:38.830 --> 25:39.789
Carl.

25:39.998 --> 25:42.792
Excuse me. There's
a Mr. Valestra
to see you.

25:42.959 --> 25:45.462
He says he has
an appointment.

25:45.670 --> 25:49.007
Ahem. If Mr. Valestra
says he has
an appointment, Virginia,

25:49.216 --> 25:51.301
then Mr. Valestra
has an appointment.

25:51.510 --> 25:54.471
That's what I like
about your pop, kiddo--

25:54.638 --> 25:57.724
he knows his priorities.

26:06.233 --> 26:07.609
Is my shirt too big,

26:07.817 --> 26:09.361
or is that
my flesh crawling?

26:09.569 --> 26:12.864
Mr. Valestra is not what
you'd call a people person.

26:13.031 --> 26:14.199
No kidding.

26:14.407 --> 26:16.243
Come on. That's just
daddy's business.

26:16.451 --> 26:17.577
He deals with everyone.

26:17.786 --> 26:20.080
It's not your father,
Andi. It's--

26:20.288 --> 26:22.082
it's everything.

26:22.290 --> 26:23.583
[Gasp]

26:24.543 --> 26:27.003
I said hand over
the cashbox, man.

26:31.216 --> 26:32.425
Uh-huh.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.427
Aah! No!

26:34.636 --> 26:35.762
Gimme!

26:35.971 --> 26:39.266
Eddie,
pops here needs
some persuading.

26:39.474 --> 26:41.601
Stay here.
I got to stop this.

26:41.810 --> 26:42.727
Bruce, no. Don't.

26:42.936 --> 26:45.272
What do you
expect me to do?

26:45.480 --> 26:47.440
Just come back
in one piece.

26:47.649 --> 26:48.650
Please?

26:52.362 --> 26:54.406
There you go.
Ha ha ha!

26:54.614 --> 26:55.824
Hey!

27:00.370 --> 27:02.831
Aah!

27:04.541 --> 27:06.751
Better have your
insurance paid up.

27:41.494 --> 27:43.663
Ha ha ha ha!

27:43.872 --> 27:45.123
Here you go!

28:00.347 --> 28:02.307
Come on!
Pick up the box!

28:02.515 --> 28:03.975
Pick up the box!

28:04.184 --> 28:07.228
Woo, woo, woo!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

28:09.439 --> 28:11.316
Oh, thank God
you're all right.

28:11.483 --> 28:12.692
I was so frightened.

28:12.901 --> 28:15.028
Let me have
a look at you.

28:15.236 --> 28:16.780
Andrea, please.

28:22.661 --> 28:23.787
No.

28:30.168 --> 28:32.587
What am I still
doing this for?

28:41.012 --> 28:42.889
It's got to be
one or the other.

28:43.098 --> 28:44.891
I can't
have it both ways.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.184
I can't put myself
on the line

28:46.393 --> 28:47.852
if there's someone
waiting for me.

28:48.436 --> 28:51.773
Miss Beaumont will be
glad you feel that way.

28:51.981 --> 28:53.983
She's holding
on line one, Sir.

28:58.613 --> 28:59.614
Master Bruce.

29:00.073 --> 29:02.450
Alfred, I can't.
Not now.

29:03.660 --> 29:05.203
What shall I say, Sir?

29:05.412 --> 29:08.790
I...Don't know.
I just don't know!

29:16.506 --> 29:18.091
It doesn't mean
I don't care anymore.

29:18.299 --> 29:20.593
I don't want
to let you down, honest,

29:20.802 --> 29:22.262
but--but...

29:22.470 --> 29:25.932
It just doesn't
hurt so bad anymore.

29:26.141 --> 29:28.101
You can understand that,
can't you?

29:28.309 --> 29:30.103
I'll give money
to the city.

29:30.311 --> 29:31.604
They can hire more cops.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.022
Let someone else
take the risk.

29:33.231 --> 29:34.190
It's different now.

29:40.238 --> 29:41.781
Please...

29:41.990 --> 29:44.826
I need it
to be different now.

29:47.370 --> 29:49.247
I know I made a promise,

29:49.456 --> 29:51.082
but I didn't
see this coming.

29:51.291 --> 29:53.835
I didn't count
on being happy.

29:59.215 --> 30:00.592
Please...

30:00.800 --> 30:03.428
Tell me that it's O.K.

30:03.636 --> 30:05.680
Maybe
they already have.

30:10.518 --> 30:11.770
Maybe they sent me.

30:43.259 --> 30:43.843
Hey!

30:45.303 --> 30:46.095
Get in.

30:52.811 --> 30:55.271
All I want to
know is, is it true?

30:55.480 --> 30:58.358
Is the Batman really
hitting our people?

30:58.566 --> 31:00.276
We have eyewitnesses.

31:00.777 --> 31:03.947
Beautiful.
That's just beautiful.

31:04.155 --> 31:06.699
Why? He never
leaned on us before.

31:06.908 --> 31:08.743
I'm too old for this.

31:08.952 --> 31:11.329
I suppose you could
demand police protection.

31:11.538 --> 31:13.331
What are you,
a comedian?

31:13.540 --> 31:15.834
This is the Batman we're
talking about here.

31:16.042 --> 31:17.335
A freak job!

31:17.544 --> 31:18.837
He'll crucify me!

31:19.045 --> 31:20.755
[Coughing]

31:30.473 --> 31:31.307
Pull over.

31:33.726 --> 31:35.478
It's not very
healthy in here.

31:42.944 --> 31:46.614
O'Neil funding corporation.
Adam's tool and die.

31:46.823 --> 31:48.616
Oh, I should
have known.

31:48.825 --> 31:49.826
Sir?

31:49.993 --> 31:51.828
Chuckie Sol
and Buzz Bronski--

31:52.036 --> 31:53.538
they have some
history together.

31:53.746 --> 31:55.290
They were partners
in dummy corporations

31:55.498 --> 31:56.958
set up
over 10 years ago.

31:57.792 --> 32:02.422
The third director was
one Salvatore Valestra.

32:02.630 --> 32:04.090
Hmm.

32:04.299 --> 32:05.884
Sal's having
company tonight.

32:06.467 --> 32:07.343
Don't wait up.

32:08.511 --> 32:10.722
Meaning, I trust, once
you're done with him,

32:10.930 --> 32:12.891
you'll be seeing her?

32:13.099 --> 32:15.894
You think you know
everything about me,
don't you?

32:16.102 --> 32:20.315
I diapered your bottom.
I bloody well ought
to...Sir!

32:22.567 --> 32:23.651
Well, you're wrong.

32:59.812 --> 33:02.440
Andrea's father?

33:03.191 --> 33:05.944
You know how much
I've always wanted
to see Europe, Bruce.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.946
Dad has business
there next week.

33:08.154 --> 33:11.032
It's some hush-hush deal.
He won't tell me a thing.

33:11.240 --> 33:13.201
He can't say when
we'd be coming back.

33:13.409 --> 33:15.995
Let me try to
talk you out of it.

33:16.204 --> 33:16.955
Bruce--

33:17.163 --> 33:18.373
wait, please.

33:21.459 --> 33:23.336
Oh...Never mind.

33:23.711 --> 33:25.421
I'm no good at this.

33:27.966 --> 33:30.593
Here,
you'll get the idea.

33:33.012 --> 33:33.888
[Gasps]

33:36.849 --> 33:37.725
What do you say?

33:40.061 --> 33:41.729
Of course I will.

33:41.938 --> 33:43.564
I never thought
this would happen.

33:43.773 --> 33:46.567
I always felt
like I'd thrown you
a curve ball,

33:46.776 --> 33:48.486
like you never knew
what to do with me

33:48.695 --> 33:50.321
because I wasn't
in the plan.

33:50.947 --> 33:53.908
You are now.
I'm changing the plan.

34:00.498 --> 34:01.666
Uhh!

34:15.471 --> 34:16.389
Uh-oh!

34:16.597 --> 34:18.349
Looks like
dad's got company,

34:18.516 --> 34:20.184
business-type company.

34:20.393 --> 34:23.438
He doesn't see clients
here, not at this hour.

34:28.150 --> 34:29.485
Maybe we should
wait till tomorrow

34:29.694 --> 34:30.987
before giving him
the good news.

34:31.446 --> 34:32.362
Maybe.

34:32.572 --> 34:34.532
Good night, Bruce,
Alfred.

34:34.741 --> 34:35.783
Miss.

34:38.369 --> 34:40.329
Rrrrrrrr!

34:52.884 --> 34:54.844
[Bruce]
It's another cave,
all right.

34:57.346 --> 34:58.765
Could be as big
as the house,

34:58.973 --> 35:00.767
judging from
the number of bats
that came out.

35:01.434 --> 35:02.810
Alfred, what's wrong?

35:03.019 --> 35:04.896
This just
arrived, Sir.

35:14.238 --> 35:15.448
"Left with dad...

35:16.240 --> 35:17.450
"Too young...

35:17.658 --> 35:19.452
"Need time...

35:19.660 --> 35:21.245
Forget about me."

36:09.627 --> 36:11.379
My God!

36:46.622 --> 36:49.500
If there was just
some other way.

37:07.685 --> 37:08.644
Aah!

37:16.360 --> 37:18.070
I hate that song.

37:19.363 --> 37:20.406
Gasp!

37:20.615 --> 37:21.908
Can it be?

37:22.116 --> 37:25.745
Old Sallie
"The Wheezer" Valestra.

37:26.787 --> 37:28.664
Welcome, paisan.

37:28.873 --> 37:31.876
It's been
a dog's age.

37:32.043 --> 37:33.085
Hello, Joker.

37:33.294 --> 37:35.588
Didn't mean to
drop by unannounced.

37:35.796 --> 37:37.465
Oh, Salvatore,

37:37.673 --> 37:39.550
why so formal?

37:39.759 --> 37:43.095
<i>Mi casa Nostra
es su casa Nostra.</i>

37:43.304 --> 37:44.222
Uhh!

37:44.430 --> 37:46.724
So, what's
an old-timer like you

37:46.933 --> 37:49.268
want with
a two-timer like me?

37:49.477 --> 37:51.187
Business. I got--

37:51.395 --> 37:54.148
ohh, business!
Sounds like fun.

37:54.357 --> 37:57.276
Come! We'll repair
to more comfortable
environs.

37:57.485 --> 37:59.779
Now, hold on
to your hat

37:59.987 --> 38:01.280
and watch
those valuables.

38:01.489 --> 38:04.408
It's going to be
a bumpy ride.

38:04.617 --> 38:07.745
Ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha!

38:09.538 --> 38:12.291
Aah!

38:12.500 --> 38:14.877
Hee hee hee hee!

38:21.676 --> 38:23.427
Honey, I'm home!

38:23.636 --> 38:24.470
[Wheezing]

38:24.679 --> 38:25.930

38:26.138 --> 38:28.599
<i>[Ruff

38:28.766 --> 38:31.102
Oh, don't mind my
home security system.

38:31.310 --> 38:32.103
Down, rusty!

38:32.311 --> 38:33.104
<i>[Ruff--]</i>

38:33.312 --> 38:34.772
[Crash]

38:34.981 --> 38:38.276
Can't be too careful with
all those weirdos around.

38:38.484 --> 38:40.361
Hee hee hee hee hee!

38:42.905 --> 38:45.283
What? Meat loaf again?

38:45.491 --> 38:47.743
Oh, I had it for lunch.

38:47.952 --> 38:50.246
Isn't hazel here
a cutie?

38:50.454 --> 38:52.290
True, she's
a real homebody,

38:52.498 --> 38:54.709
but you can't help
who you fall in love with.

38:54.917 --> 38:55.793
Ooh!

38:57.420 --> 39:00.381
Come. Have a seat, Sal.

39:01.257 --> 39:04.802
Tell me what's on
your so-called mind.

39:05.011 --> 39:07.305
It's Batman.
He's gone nuts.

39:07.513 --> 39:10.099
First he whacked
Chuckie Sol,

39:10.308 --> 39:11.434
then Buzz,

39:11.642 --> 39:13.102
and now
he's after me.

39:13.311 --> 39:16.105
I've been reading lately
how old guano-man

39:16.314 --> 39:18.524
is wound tight enough
to snap.

39:18.733 --> 39:20.818
Wouldn't it be great
if I've finally

39:21.027 --> 39:23.446
driven him off
the deep end? Ha ha ha!

39:23.654 --> 39:25.948
This isn't a joke!
Batman's knocking us off,

39:26.157 --> 39:28.284
and you're the only one
who can take him down.

39:28.492 --> 39:30.369
Look, 5 million up front

39:30.578 --> 39:32.204
with whatever you want
to finish him off.

39:33.372 --> 39:34.707
[Yawn]

39:34.915 --> 39:38.294
What do I look like,
pest control?

39:38.502 --> 39:39.378
Think, you fool!

39:39.587 --> 39:42.173
Once he gets me,
how long till he gets you?

39:42.381 --> 39:44.175
You know what
I'm talking about.

39:44.383 --> 39:47.178
Your hands
are just as dirty.

39:47.386 --> 39:49.180
Dirtier!

39:49.388 --> 39:50.348
Grrr!

39:50.514 --> 39:52.350
Don't touch me,
old man.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.352
I don't know
where you've been.

39:54.560 --> 39:58.356
Oh, Sal, no one can
take a joke like you.

39:58.564 --> 40:00.191
Of course
I'll help you out.

40:00.399 --> 40:01.192
Really?

40:01.400 --> 40:02.777
<i>Certainement.</i>

40:02.985 --> 40:07.490
No way is anybody going
to hurt my pal Sal.

40:07.698 --> 40:10.993
That's it. That's
what I want to see--

40:11.202 --> 40:14.789
a nice big smile.

40:15.915 --> 40:17.875
Thanks for
another lovely dinner.

40:18.084 --> 40:19.001
My pleasure.

40:20.753 --> 40:23.923
It's not good to go to bed
on a full stomach.

40:24.131 --> 40:25.674
We could stay up,

40:25.883 --> 40:27.176
talk for a while.

40:27.385 --> 40:29.720
Oh, Artie, I've got
a killer day tomorrow.

40:29.929 --> 40:31.722
But call me, O.K.?

40:31.931 --> 40:33.099
Mmm!

40:33.307 --> 40:34.850
[Lips smacking]

40:35.059 --> 40:35.851
Good night.

40:36.060 --> 40:37.103
Good night.

40:42.900 --> 40:43.901
Hmm.

40:44.110 --> 40:45.403
So we meet again.

40:45.569 --> 40:47.071
I like the cape.

40:47.238 --> 40:49.865
Not sure about
the mask though.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.618
Have you
ever seen this?

40:54.620 --> 40:55.371
No.

40:55.579 --> 40:56.914
But that's your father.

40:57.123 --> 40:59.917
He's the one
who set up their
corporate partnership.

41:00.126 --> 41:01.919
So? That's his job.

41:02.128 --> 41:05.506
He was the one element
that tied these
gangsters together.

41:05.714 --> 41:07.007
Where's your father now?

41:07.216 --> 41:09.510
Haven't a clue.
Why don't you
try Madagascar?

41:09.718 --> 41:11.637
That's not what
you told Reeves!

41:11.846 --> 41:14.265
You told him you
were closer than ever
to your father.

41:14.473 --> 41:15.975
You had me bugged?

41:16.183 --> 41:17.226
I can read lips.

41:17.435 --> 41:20.146
Then read them now.
Get out.

41:24.859 --> 41:26.569
You still following
your dad's orders?

41:26.777 --> 41:28.070
The way I see it,

41:28.279 --> 41:30.072
the only one
in this room

41:30.281 --> 41:31.782
controlled by
his parents is you.

41:46.672 --> 41:49.049
[Sobbing]

42:22.166 --> 42:23.792

<i>to say nothing
of his legs, feet,
spleen, and head!</i>

43:38.909 --> 43:40.744
Stay away!
This is not your fight.

43:41.662 --> 43:42.413
Haa!

43:43.706 --> 43:45.416
This madness ends now.

43:57.136 --> 43:58.345
Batman,

43:58.554 --> 44:00.848
this is the police.
You're under arrest.

44:01.056 --> 44:03.350
Step away from
the edge of the roof.

44:03.559 --> 44:07.605
Put your hands on your head
and stay in the light.

44:07.813 --> 44:08.939
Stay on him!

Come on, you grunts!

46:56.023 --> 46:57.399
Ohh!

46:57.566 --> 46:58.776
Andrea?

46:58.984 --> 47:00.068
Hurry!

47:03.071 --> 47:04.198
Who's that?

47:06.200 --> 47:08.160
[Panting]

47:14.583 --> 47:15.959
There are
certain advantages

47:16.168 --> 47:18.378
to having
a sturdy cranium,
master Bruce.

47:18.587 --> 47:22.382
But then hard-headedness
was always your virtue.

47:22.591 --> 47:25.886
Well, I'm sure I have
things to do elsewhere.

47:26.094 --> 47:27.721
You have, uh,

47:27.930 --> 47:30.390
an excellent
sense of timing.

47:30.599 --> 47:33.227
It was all over TV.
I had to do something.

47:33.435 --> 47:34.728
I'm grateful, of course.

47:34.937 --> 47:35.979
But I still need to know

47:36.188 --> 47:38.482
why you're not
telling me the truth
about your father.

47:41.109 --> 47:43.237
Well, I suppose the world's
greatest detective

47:43.445 --> 47:44.822
will find out eventually.

47:45.030 --> 47:47.658
You remember daddy
was having a meeting
that night

47:47.866 --> 47:49.368
with his partners.

47:55.123 --> 47:56.583
Rrrrrrrrrr!

47:59.211 --> 48:01.171
[Chuckie]
You're a liar
and a cheat, Carl.

48:01.380 --> 48:03.799
[Valestra]
You've taken
what's ours.

48:04.007 --> 48:05.384
You're going
to pay one way
or another.

48:05.592 --> 48:06.385
No, please!

48:06.593 --> 48:07.803
Daddy, what's going on?

48:08.011 --> 48:08.804
Uhh!

48:10.389 --> 48:13.433
I'm sorry you
had to see this,
miss Beaumont.

48:15.894 --> 48:17.145
Let her go!

48:17.354 --> 48:18.480
Watch it, Carl.

48:19.898 --> 48:22.109
Please, Sal, give me
one more day.

48:22.317 --> 48:23.569
I'll get the money.

48:23.777 --> 48:25.153
Convince me.

48:25.362 --> 48:27.614
This time tomorrow,
on my mother's grave,

48:27.823 --> 48:29.366
as soon as
the European banks open,

48:29.575 --> 48:31.285
I'll have the whole
amount wired to you.

48:42.170 --> 48:43.547
[Coughs]

48:43.755 --> 48:46.008
24 hours.

48:46.216 --> 48:49.011
This time tomorrow,
we'll have the money,

48:49.219 --> 48:52.014
or I'll have your heart
in my hand.

48:52.222 --> 48:53.807
Let's go, boys.

48:54.016 --> 48:55.183
Uhh!

49:00.939 --> 49:01.690
Tsk.

49:05.986 --> 49:07.321
Dad, are you
all right?

49:07.529 --> 49:10.115
Pack a suitcase.
We've got to get
to the airport now!

49:10.324 --> 49:12.075
You said you'd
have the money.

49:12.284 --> 49:13.577
It's not that simple.

49:13.785 --> 49:15.245
The money's
tied up in investments.

49:15.454 --> 49:16.997
It'll take weeks
to free up.

49:17.205 --> 49:18.206
But I can't leave.

49:18.415 --> 49:20.709
Bruce proposed. We're
going to get married.

49:20.918 --> 49:22.210
Listen to me.

49:22.419 --> 49:26.214
I just used up
the last shred of pity
Sal Valestra has.

49:26.423 --> 49:29.051
If I don't pay him back
within 24 hours,

49:29.259 --> 49:31.136
they'll kill us both!

49:31.970 --> 49:33.555
Why'd you do this, dad?

49:33.764 --> 49:35.766
Why'd you get involved
with these people?

49:36.558 --> 49:37.768
I'm sorry, Andi.

49:37.976 --> 49:40.270
I just wanted
a chance for you.

49:40.479 --> 49:42.272
I'll get you
out of this.

49:42.481 --> 49:45.776
Somehow we'll be
free of those guys,
whatever it takes.

49:45.984 --> 49:47.694
That's a promise.

49:49.655 --> 49:52.532
[Andrea]
From that night,
we were on the run.

49:52.741 --> 49:54.534
We hid all over Europe,

49:54.743 --> 49:56.536
eventually settled
on the Mediterranean coast.

49:56.745 --> 50:00.540
Dad was able to parlay
the money he embezzled
into a fortune.

50:01.875 --> 50:03.460
Finally, he had enough
to pay them back,

50:03.669 --> 50:04.962
or so he thought.

50:05.170 --> 50:06.964
It would
never be enough.

50:07.172 --> 50:09.049
They wanted interest
compounded in blood.

50:09.257 --> 50:11.051
He had to
find another way.

50:11.259 --> 50:13.971
The man in the costume--
your father?

50:14.179 --> 50:16.473
He said he'd
get them, somehow.

50:16.682 --> 50:18.475
When I heard
about Chuckie Sol,

50:18.684 --> 50:21.061
well, I had to
come back to find him,

50:21.269 --> 50:22.562
to stop him.

50:22.771 --> 50:24.064
I'm sorry, Bruce.

50:24.272 --> 50:27.067
That's twice now
I've come into your life

50:27.275 --> 50:28.944
and screwed it up.

50:44.418 --> 50:45.085
Ooh!

51:08.692 --> 51:10.777
Can we make it
work this time?

51:10.986 --> 51:12.279
I want to say yes,

51:13.530 --> 51:14.948
but you know it's
going to come down

51:15.157 --> 51:16.241
between me
and your father.

51:16.783 --> 51:18.869
Daddy doesn't
matter anymore.

51:28.962 --> 51:30.338
[Honk]

51:31.465 --> 51:32.549
I'll see you tonight.

51:32.758 --> 51:34.176
I'll be here.

51:39.681 --> 51:42.893
It's so good to see
you and miss Beaumont
together again.

51:43.101 --> 51:46.229
Might one ask
what this bodes
for your alter-ego?

51:49.274 --> 51:50.859
I'm not sure,
Alfred.

51:52.444 --> 51:54.654
Everything's
happening so fast.

51:56.615 --> 51:58.158
So much has changed.

51:58.366 --> 52:00.160
You still
love each other.

52:00.368 --> 52:01.661
It's true.

52:01.870 --> 52:03.663
I love her.

52:03.872 --> 52:06.541
Maybe after
this is settled...

52:06.750 --> 52:08.043
Maybe then.

52:08.251 --> 52:11.213

01:07:39.098 --> 01:07:41.058
Let me go
or we'll both die!

01:07:41.559 --> 01:07:43.102
Whatever it takes.

01:07:44.061 --> 01:07:45.730
Aah!

01:08:04.707 --> 01:08:09.086
For once, I'm stuck
without a punch line.

01:08:10.671 --> 01:08:12.298
Uh-oh.

01:08:13.382 --> 01:08:16.051
O.K. I give up.

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:17.553
I surrendered already.

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:19.430
Tell her, Batman.

01:08:19.638 --> 01:08:20.639
Andrea...

01:08:20.848 --> 01:08:23.642
You've got to get
out of here.

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:26.895
The place is wired
to e-explode!

01:08:27.104 --> 01:08:30.483
No. One way or another,
it ends tonight.

01:08:30.691 --> 01:08:32.151
Goodbye, my love.

01:08:36.447 --> 01:08:38.823

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.279
Andrea!

01:10:06.245 --> 01:10:08.038
I couldn't save her,
Alfred.

01:10:08.247 --> 01:10:10.833
I don't think
she wanted
to be saved, Sir.

01:10:11.125 --> 01:10:13.544
Vengeance
blackens the soul,
Bruce.

01:10:13.752 --> 01:10:16.213
I always feared
you would become

01:10:16.422 --> 01:10:18.174
that which
you fought against.

01:10:18.382 --> 01:10:20.759
You walk the edge
of that abyss
every night.

01:10:20.926 --> 01:10:22.595
But you haven't
fallen in,

01:10:22.803 --> 01:10:24.555
and I thank heaven
for that.

01:10:27.766 --> 01:10:30.561
But Andrea
fell into that pit
years ago,

01:10:30.769 --> 01:10:32.521
and no one,
not even you,

01:10:32.730 --> 01:10:34.106
could've
pulled her back.

01:10:44.158 --> 01:10:45.284
What is it?

01:11:29.578 --> 01:11:30.955
Quite a sight.

01:11:31.163 --> 01:11:32.456
Yes.

01:11:32.665 --> 01:11:34.166
I'm sorry.

01:11:34.375 --> 01:11:37.169
Do--do you want
to be alone?

01:11:37.378 --> 01:11:38.712
I am.
