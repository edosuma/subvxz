Doth my eyeth see?

00:32.699 --> 00:33.950
Can it be?

00:33.950 --> 00:36.828
Fire:
It's the eternal crystal!

00:36.828 --> 00:40.039
This is what's gotten
everyone's chainmail bunched up?

00:41.458 --> 00:42.959
That dusty warlock didn't know
what he was talking about.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.836
This was
a piece of cake.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.341
Look out!

00:52.594 --> 00:56.139
It's the two-headed dragon
of Leiash.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.974
Ready thine weapon,
Fire.

00:57.974 --> 01:01.186
My blade is always ready, Ice.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.939
And the dragon collided
with the warriors,

01:05.023 --> 01:07.484
sending them flying
into the castle wall!

01:07.484 --> 01:09.277
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:09.277 --> 01:10.445
And then Fire
fell to her knees

01:10.445 --> 01:12.238
a-and looked at
her worried partner.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.907
"Whether in death
or in life,

01:13.907 --> 01:16.993
you're the one
I long for by my side."

01:16.993 --> 01:19.579
That was really beautiful,
Kelsey.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.706
You really write
a compelling story.

01:21.790 --> 01:22.999
Ah,
c'mon, Stacks.

01:22.999 --> 01:24.375
Your idea
of the dragon

01:24.459 --> 01:26.002
appearing in the temple
at the last second

01:26.002 --> 01:28.838
gives this chapter
the kind of intensity it needs!

01:28.922 --> 01:31.007
Ooh, I can't wait to share
"The Legend of Bagravan"

01:31.007 --> 01:32.717
with everyone
at the book club!

01:32.801 --> 01:34.427
Oh, but I hope
it isn't too violent.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.012
I wouldn't wanna live
in Bagravan.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.347
Yeah, me, neither.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.933
Bagravan --
more like <i>Bad-gravan.</i>

01:41.476 --> 01:44.312
More like...
Sad-gravan!

01:47.190 --> 01:50.193
Ah, Stacks,
you get me.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.695
Welcome back,
fellow book club members.

01:52.779 --> 01:57.033
You've all been given the sacred
task of writing your own tales.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.494
Who dareth
to shareth?

01:59.494 --> 02:02.038
Ooh, ooh!
Me! Me dareth!

02:02.038 --> 02:05.083
This is the latest installment
of my Slide the ferret

02:05.083 --> 02:07.377
detective A.U. fanfic --

02:07.377 --> 02:09.879
"Private Slide,
Slide-vate Eye!"

02:12.507 --> 02:14.509
Slide looked at the crime scene.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.386
"This city is cold, kid.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.722
As cold as this
pastrami sandwich."

02:19.806 --> 02:21.224
Lieutenant Oswald shivered.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.852
With tears in his eyes,
he whispered,

02:23.852 --> 02:26.062
"Can love bloom
on the battlefield?"

02:26.062 --> 02:28.523
Just then,
the Universe-a-Corn

02:28.523 --> 02:31.985
galloped out of sub-space
and raced around Saturn's rings!

02:31.985 --> 02:36.114
The space jockey looked at
the galactic steed and said...

02:36.114 --> 02:38.366
"I'm not going to lose
another one!"

02:38.366 --> 02:39.617
Dr. Corgi yelled.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.328
"We will find that chew toy!"

02:42.412 --> 02:45.081
And that's when
the train guy realized

02:45.081 --> 02:49.210
that he had been a ghost
the whole time!

02:49.294 --> 02:51.713
Ha-cha-cha-cha...

02:55.258 --> 02:56.426
I wasn't scared.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.428
Quite the bittersweet ending!

02:58.428 --> 02:59.888
Yeah!
What a twist!

02:59.888 --> 03:02.599
That dancing skeleton
makes a lot of sense now.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.058
Thanks.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.185
The ending was
kind of hard to write.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.688
I had some help from
my sister's girlfriend, Kat.

03:08.688 --> 03:09.981
She's a real good writer.

03:09.981 --> 03:12.108
Gooder than me, that's for sure.

03:12.108 --> 03:15.403
Children of the book club,
the time has come.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.946
Are you ready for...

03:17.030 --> 03:18.990
"The Legend of Bagravan"?

03:21.743 --> 03:23.328
Everybody quiet!

03:23.328 --> 03:25.788
Fire pulled Ice
from the wreckage...

03:28.917 --> 03:31.419
Ice,
are you alright?

03:31.419 --> 03:33.588
Yeah.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.887
Ice!

03:40.887 --> 03:44.599
I hope
you like your ice crushed!

03:44.599 --> 03:47.226
Ice! No!

03:47.310 --> 03:49.479
Fire?!

03:49.479 --> 03:52.690
Whether in death
or in life,

03:52.774 --> 03:56.402
you're the one
I long for by my side.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.196
And I you.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.906
And then
the dragon reared back

03:59.906 --> 04:03.868
and blew a tornado of flames
at the warriors...

04:03.952 --> 04:05.620
And that's all we got
so far!

04:05.620 --> 04:07.372
Wow!
What a story!

04:07.372 --> 04:10.083
That's pretty good
so far!

04:07.455 --> 04:10.083
Wish I could write
like that.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.710
Wow,
that was so cool!

04:12.794 --> 04:16.339
When that dragon came in,
I was so activated!

04:16.339 --> 04:18.549
And it was
so romantic!

04:18.633 --> 04:21.177
Those last words
brought me to tears.

04:21.177 --> 04:23.012
And it was
full of suspense!

04:23.096 --> 04:25.807
Like when that dragon's claw
was about to come down on Ice,

04:25.807 --> 04:27.475
and then Kelsey
stopped it.

04:27.475 --> 04:28.726
Wait h-hold up,
Craig.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.603
You mean Fire,
not Kelsey.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.189
Kelsey isn't
the character's name.

04:33.189 --> 04:34.607
Huh.
Did I say Kelsey?

04:34.691 --> 04:36.109
Eh,
sorry about that.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.611
The characters just feel
so much like you and Stacks.

04:38.695 --> 04:39.988
Now that
you mention it,

04:39.988 --> 04:43.282
they seem to be
so very much like you two.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.493
Yeah, Ice was Bagravan's
Keeper of Words.

04:45.493 --> 04:48.037
She wore a crown of light,
like you, Stacks!

04:48.121 --> 04:49.372
Right!

04:49.372 --> 04:52.583
And Fire has that fiery hair
in a bun, kinda like you.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.502
And has a sword,
like you.

04:54.502 --> 04:56.045
And is really brave
and will do anything

04:56.129 --> 04:57.964
for her friends,
like you.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.049
I'm sorry, I thought
that was intentional.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.384
I really liked it.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.635
O-Oh!

05:02.719 --> 05:04.345
Well, they do say
that art imitates life.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.723
We didn't even notice it
when we were writing it.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.559
Craig:
If it was a movie, you guys
should play the characters.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.061
Ooh, yeah,
that'd be perfect!

05:25.992 --> 05:28.619
Kelsey: <i>Kelsey pondered
her literary predicament.</i>

05:28.703 --> 05:30.997
<i>Was Kelsey truly like Fire?</i>

05:30.997 --> 05:33.124
<i>Was Stacks truly like Ice?</i>

05:33.124 --> 05:37.420
<i>Were Kelsey and Stacks like...
Fire and Ice?</i>

05:37.420 --> 05:40.298
<i>Would that...be okay?</i>

05:47.764 --> 05:49.182
Hello?

05:49.182 --> 05:53.102
Hey, Kels, you left the book
club so suddenly yesterday.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.063
Are...you alright?

05:55.063 --> 05:57.190
Uh, yeah!
Everything is fine.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.610
Um, my tums was acting up
from all the, uh...

06:00.610 --> 06:02.445
the compliments
we were getting.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.905
Just, so, uh,
you know me...

06:03.905 --> 06:05.364
Had to toot.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.200
Oh! Good.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.494
Well, not good about your --
your tums.

06:09.494 --> 06:12.455
I can't wait to get working on
the next part of the story.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.956
The -- The story?

06:14.040 --> 06:15.416
Uh, about that --

06:15.500 --> 06:19.003
um, I've been having
a bit of writer's block.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.631
<i>Huh, well, maybe we could
get together</i>

06:21.631 --> 06:23.800
<i>and try and think of
some new ideas.</i>

06:23.800 --> 06:25.301
Ah, listen...

06:25.301 --> 06:29.013
I think we should cancel book
club for the foreseeable future.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.807
Foreseeable future?

06:30.807 --> 06:33.059
<i>But, Kels, I --</i>

06:30.890 --> 06:33.059
I have to go!

06:33.059 --> 06:35.978
Uh, but, uh, I'll talk to you
later or whatever.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.440
Craig: You can't cancel
book club!

06:39.524 --> 06:41.150
Yeah, I'm literally itching
to find out

06:41.234 --> 06:43.069
if Fire and Ice
defeat the dragon!

06:43.069 --> 06:44.821
I mean,
look at my arm!

06:44.821 --> 06:46.656
I'm sorry, guys.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.074
I've just been
having trouble

06:48.074 --> 06:50.243
thinking about
what to write next.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.995
Eh, so maybe you just need
some inspiration!

06:55.123 --> 06:58.668
Make way for the new
side heroes of Bagravan!

06:58.668 --> 07:01.879
I am the mighty warrior
of the wind, Ayre!

07:01.963 --> 07:06.551
And I'm your co-host,
Durt!

07:06.551 --> 07:08.886
Ayre and Durt swoop in
and counterattack,

07:08.970 --> 07:11.180
knocking the dragon
off their feet!

07:11.264 --> 07:12.723
Swoosh! Slash!

07:12.807 --> 07:16.018
What's that over yonder,
Ayre?!

07:16.102 --> 07:19.063
It looks like that
dastardly dragon's second cousin

07:19.147 --> 07:21.607
is attacking those
defenseless soldiers!

07:21.691 --> 07:26.195
Feel the power
of my rock slide!

07:27.363 --> 07:28.906
Aw, missed.
Dang!

07:28.990 --> 07:30.616
Guys, knock it off!

07:30.700 --> 07:31.742
Durt 'splosion!

07:31.826 --> 07:33.703
That's not
how the story goes!

07:33.703 --> 07:35.580
Craig: Wait, Kelsey!
Kelsey, wait!

07:33.786 --> 07:35.580
I said stop it!
Stop!

07:35.580 --> 07:37.915
Why are you so mad?!

07:35.663 --> 07:37.915
Wait, Kelsey!
Wait, no!

07:37.999 --> 07:39.542
I'm sorry.
I just...

07:39.542 --> 07:41.127
You guys can't help me
write this.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.254
This story is only for me
and Stacks to write,

07:43.254 --> 07:45.548
and I-I like that it's only
about Fire and Ice.

07:45.548 --> 07:47.633
It's just...
You know, it's complicated.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.218
I feel like...

07:49.302 --> 07:50.761
I dunno...
I...I...

07:50.845 --> 07:52.054
I need
to talk to someone

07:52.138 --> 07:53.931
who knows more about
this kind of stuff.

07:54.015 --> 07:57.018
I might know someone
who can help.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.103
So as
a professional writer...

07:59.187 --> 08:00.438
what do you think,
Kat?

08:01.564 --> 08:04.483
Not you, Goo,
I was talking to Kat!

08:04.567 --> 08:05.735
Ugh!

08:05.735 --> 08:08.571
"You're the one I long for
by my side..."

08:08.571 --> 08:09.697
Oooh.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.782
You and your friend Stacks
wrote this?

08:11.866 --> 08:15.828
Yeah!
Uh, w-w-what do you think?

08:15.912 --> 08:17.580
This is
a great story.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.332
I love
the world you've built.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.250
What about the characters?
W-What do you think about them?

08:21.334 --> 08:22.919
I mean, does Kels--
uh, Fire.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.671
Does Fire --
Is she too impulsive?

08:25.755 --> 08:27.006
With the dragon?

08:27.006 --> 08:29.759
But, y'know,
mostly with Ice?

08:29.759 --> 08:33.804
Hmm, well she is the
personification of Fire, right?

08:33.888 --> 08:35.973
Yeah! She's passionate
about what she wants,

08:36.057 --> 08:37.892
but she can also be
a bit intense.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.394
Because, you know,
th-that is how fire works.

08:42.021 --> 08:45.024
I think it's pretty natural for
the characters to act this way.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.817
You've got good
writer instincts.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.027
Just follow your gut.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.612
It looks like
you and Stacks

08:49.612 --> 08:51.530
really put your hearts
into this.

08:51.614 --> 08:52.782
As Fire and Ice,

08:52.782 --> 08:55.284
you're jumping
right out of the pages!

08:55.368 --> 08:56.494
Wait!

08:56.494 --> 08:57.787
No, i-it's not us.
I-I can change it!

08:57.787 --> 08:59.205
I-I-I gotta --
gotta make it different!

08:59.205 --> 09:01.290
I'll change it to-to-to-to
somethin' else!

09:01.374 --> 09:02.458
No, no, no!

09:02.458 --> 09:04.502
I love it
the way it is!

09:04.502 --> 09:07.880
But...
what if people think it's me?

09:07.964 --> 09:09.757
Kat: It's okay
if it is.

09:09.757 --> 09:12.802
Good writers
write what they know.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.553
Writing is vulnerable.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.222
Writing is sharing.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.140
This story
is a part of you,

09:18.224 --> 09:21.644
and you shouldn't hold back
any beautiful part of yourself.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.939
Kat:
But I have one note.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.148
There's no ending!

09:26.232 --> 09:29.026
I wanna know what happens
to Fire and Ice.

09:29.110 --> 09:32.655
I think I know
what I want to happen.

09:32.655 --> 09:36.492
I hope you like
your ice crushed!

09:36.492 --> 09:38.160
Fire:
Ice! No!

09:39.537 --> 09:41.664
Fire?!

09:41.664 --> 09:44.875
Whether in death
or in life,

09:44.959 --> 09:48.170
you're the one
I long for by my side.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.339
And I you.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.675
But this isn't
the end for us!

09:55.094 --> 09:57.805
The eternal crystal!

10:06.397 --> 10:08.691
I-Impossibloo!

10:14.113 --> 10:17.158
Kelsey:
And they cut the dragon in half
and lived happily ever after.

10:17.158 --> 10:19.035
The end!

10:21.746 --> 10:23.289
Craig: I was thinking,
if there's a movie...

10:23.289 --> 10:25.666
This was so much fun,
Kels!

10:25.750 --> 10:27.168
I hope...we can...

10:27.168 --> 10:29.503
continue writing stories
together.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.881
Yeah,
I'd love that.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.883
I like writing these stories
with you,

10:33.883 --> 10:37.011
but I really love
being able to hang out

10:37.011 --> 10:40.598
and spend more time
with you 'cause...

10:40.598 --> 10:44.435
I,
I...I...

10:44.435 --> 10:46.187
I like you.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.897
Whether in
the pages of a book

10:47.897 --> 10:50.024
or in the time
we share together...

10:50.024 --> 10:53.819
you're the girl I long for
by my side.

11:06.415 --> 11:09.335
♪ When it's time to go to bed ♪

11:09.335 --> 11:13.798
♪ I know
I don't have to feel alone ♪

11:13.798 --> 11:17.051
♪ 'Cause I'll see you tomorrow ♪

11:17.051 --> 11:18.594
♪ At the creek ♪

11:18.594 --> 11:20.930
Just like I drew it.
