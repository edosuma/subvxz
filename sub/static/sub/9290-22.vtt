00:12.200 --> 00:14.345
"Previously on" 24.

00:14.441 --> 00:17.672
I just got off the phone with one of
my sources over at Keeler's headquarters.

00:17.769 --> 00:21.065
Sherry was there,
meeting privately with Keeler.

00:21.161 --> 00:24.137
- Meeting Keeler about what?
- He didn't know, David.

00:24.265 --> 00:28.906
I came here because I can guarantee you
a win in November.

00:29.002 --> 00:32.650
David Palmer is an accessory to murder.

00:32.746 --> 00:37.451
David lied to the chief of police last night
in order to provide an alibi for me.

00:37.547 --> 00:40.333
- Why are you lying to me?
- I screwed up earlier.

00:40.428 --> 00:43.531
The sat transmission on my system
was forged by my own people.

00:43.627 --> 00:46.316
Making a mistake is one thing.
Covering it up is another.

00:46.411 --> 00:49.708
I can't let you stay in place.
I am taking over command of C.T.U. Now.

00:49.803 --> 00:53.964
- I made a mistake, Jack.
- No, Tony. You made two.

00:54.061 --> 00:56.013
I'm going to let you
speak to your husband.

00:56.141 --> 00:58.989
Tell him that you're okay
and you're being treated well.

00:59.086 --> 01:00.717
- " Are you all right?"
- " I'm fine."

01:00.813 --> 01:03.950
- Don't let them do this.
- If Jane is not released when I order it...

01:04.045 --> 01:06.894
your wife dies...
that's all you need to know.

01:07.021 --> 01:09.166
Are we clear?

01:09.262 --> 01:12.495
From this point on,
I'm assuming control of C.T.U.

01:12.592 --> 01:14.671
Tony Almeida has stepped down.

01:14.766 --> 01:16.688
I'm taking Jane Saunders
to Division.

01:16.816 --> 01:18.671
"Here's the order."

01:18.768 --> 01:20.495
- We're leaving right now.
- Okay.

01:20.592 --> 01:23.503
We're going out this way here.

01:23.631 --> 01:26.543
- Where are all the guards?
- We don't need those guards anymore.

01:26.671 --> 01:29.489
Jack! Tony locked me in here.
Saunders has Michelle.

01:29.585 --> 01:31.473
He's using her as leverage
to get his daughter out.

01:31.568 --> 01:33.937
This is Almeida. We're out. I've got her.

01:34.033 --> 01:36.273
I'll give you
further instructions in 20 minutes.

01:36.370 --> 01:39.664
Exit security,
I need a 20 on Tony Almeida.

01:42.225 --> 01:45.746
The following takes place between
10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m.

01:48.466 --> 01:50.292
Excuse me.

01:50.387 --> 01:53.234
Chloe, I want you to pull up
all the surveillance tape from every exit.

01:53.332 --> 01:55.763
I want you to focus
on the last 10 minutes.

01:55.891 --> 01:58.578
- Adam, have you linked up
with traffic surveillance yet?
- I'm working with Caltrans.

01:58.675 --> 02:01.651
- I heard Tony took Jane Saunders
out without authorization.
- That's right.

02:01.780 --> 02:05.300
- "Why?"
- Saunders has Michelle. He wants
to trade her for his daughter.

02:05.396 --> 02:07.860
- Jane Saunders is the only leverage we have.
- Trust me. I know that.

02:07.989 --> 02:09.589
I got him.
He left the building three minutes ago...

02:09.686 --> 02:13.109
- and drove off the premises 90 seconds later.
- Adam, he's in a silver S.U.V.

02:13.238 --> 02:16.374
Chase, prep a tactical team.
Be ready to move as soon as I give you an order.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.605
I got him. Jack, he's on Fifth about
a half a mile from here, heading east.

02:19.701 --> 02:22.774
I'll call you from the car.

02:31.190 --> 02:34.264
" Son of a bitch."

02:34.360 --> 02:37.974
- Are you okay?
- It's just traffic.

02:38.071 --> 02:39.927
You've been acting
all weird since we left.

02:40.024 --> 02:42.712
There's a lot going on right now.

02:42.808 --> 02:46.938
You never really explained why you wanted to
transfer me to this Division place.

02:47.032 --> 02:49.401
- I told you.
- I know what you told me. It doesn't make sense.

02:49.497 --> 02:51.578
Well, I don't have the time to explain it
to you right now.

02:57.817 --> 02:59.707
Almeida got my daughter out of C.T.U.

02:59.802 --> 03:01.626
You need to be ready to move
the moment I tell you.

03:01.722 --> 03:05.403
- When are you calling Almeida with instructions?
- Fifteen minutes.

03:05.499 --> 03:07.515
I'll be with Frederick.

03:16.028 --> 03:19.292
At least 800 people are dead or dying
in the Chandler Plaza Hotel...

03:19.387 --> 03:23.197
because Saunders released a weaponized virus
into the ventilation system.

03:23.325 --> 03:27.004
What the media is reporting
is a cover story.

03:27.101 --> 03:30.845
They're deflecting the truth
to avoid mass panic.

03:30.942 --> 03:34.972
You'll be infected along with everyone else!

03:35.070 --> 03:39.263
No matter what he's paying you,
it's not worth losing your life!

03:43.806 --> 03:47.008
Jack's in pursuit of Tony. We move out
as soon as we get a location on Saunders.

03:47.104 --> 03:50.944
Understood?
Good. Kim.

03:51.073 --> 03:53.439
- Yeah?
- "What are you doing?"

03:53.567 --> 03:55.391
I'm working with the team
that's monitoring my father.

03:55.488 --> 03:57.793
- "I thought you were setting up a tactical unit."
- Yeah. I am.

03:57.888 --> 04:00.736
We have to wait until we get a location
on Saunders. Until then we're on standby.

04:00.833 --> 04:02.464
- All right.
- Listen.

04:02.561 --> 04:05.026
Before I have to go back out there,
I wanna talk to you.

04:05.155 --> 04:09.025
- About what?
- About us.

04:11.427 --> 04:14.338
I need to know whether
there's gonna be an us.

04:18.882 --> 04:23.747
Look, I've been thinking about it a lot,
and the baby changes everything.

04:23.875 --> 04:26.243
It doesn't change
the way I feel about you.

04:26.371 --> 04:29.605
Let's forget about me for a second.
You have a daughter...

04:29.701 --> 04:31.780
and a job that won't let you
be with her.

04:31.875 --> 04:34.788
Is that you talking or your father?

04:34.916 --> 04:39.237
My dad would be the first one to admit it.
He wasn't the greatest dad.

04:39.365 --> 04:43.141
And it wasn't because
he didn't love me. I know he loved me.

04:44.358 --> 04:46.727
It was because of his job.

04:48.710 --> 04:52.262
If I transferred out of Field Ops,
would you consider staying with me?

04:58.247 --> 05:03.080
I wanna stay with you.
And I would raise a child with you, Chase.

05:05.863 --> 05:08.232
I just won't raise one for you.

05:21.257 --> 05:23.947
- Adam, is he still on Fifth Street?
- No. I lost him.

05:24.042 --> 05:27.370
- He must've turned between Jarvis and Hill.
- Widen the search.

05:27.499 --> 05:32.234
I am. Okay, Jack. I've got him. He's going
south on Vine, two blocks below Hill.

05:32.331 --> 05:34.602
- You can save some time by cutting...
- Okay. I got it.

05:38.635 --> 05:41.548
He's hit traffic at Fillmore.
You might be able to intercept on Grand.

05:48.972 --> 05:54.380
Look, I know you're lying to me.
I know you're not taking me to Division.

05:54.477 --> 05:56.846
You'll be fine, Jane. All right?

05:56.941 --> 05:59.150
At least tell me where we're going.

05:59.245 --> 06:03.982
- Where are you taking me?
- Back to your father.

06:04.109 --> 06:07.054
My father? Why?

06:07.182 --> 06:11.246
He's holding my wife hostage. He'll kill her
if I don't take you back to him.

06:14.479 --> 06:16.943
So, basically, you're kidnapping me?

06:18.703 --> 06:22.353
- I'm sorry.
- After everything he's done...

06:22.448 --> 06:24.785
how can you be sure
he'll do what he says?

06:24.880 --> 06:27.919
How do you know he won't
kill your wife anyway?

06:28.015 --> 06:32.752
I don't have a choice.
I wish I did, but I don't.

06:50.419 --> 06:53.716
Tony, put the gun on the dash!

06:53.844 --> 06:57.652
Put the gun on the dash now!

07:05.780 --> 07:07.925
Slowly get out of the car.

07:13.622 --> 07:16.790
Jane, stay where you are.
Everything's gonna be fine.

07:18.486 --> 07:21.239
Saunders has Michelle.

07:21.335 --> 07:25.045
- I know.
- He wants to make a trade.
Michelle for his daughter.

07:25.143 --> 07:27.960
- "I know. I can't let that happen."
- I almost lost her once today.

07:28.054 --> 07:29.687
- I'm not losing her again.
- Tony, listen to me.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.768
I understand exactly how you're feeling.
I've been there.

07:31.895 --> 07:34.647
And you handled it just like me!
You kept everyone else out of it.

07:34.744 --> 07:37.528
- This is different. Millions of lives are at stake.
- Rules apply to other people...

07:37.625 --> 07:41.080
- but not to you, right, Jack?
- Tony, just calm down. Okay, come on.

07:41.208 --> 07:43.576
You help me make this trade,
I'll turn myself in...

07:43.672 --> 07:45.913
go to prison,
whatever has gotta happen.

07:46.010 --> 07:48.313
I can't do it.
We need Jane to lure her father in.

07:48.409 --> 07:52.666
- "Even if it means Michelle's gotta die?"
- Michelle doesn't have to die.

07:52.794 --> 07:55.130
We can string Saunders along.
I need you to start working with me.

07:55.227 --> 07:57.434
- Chase has already got a strike team...
- No! No, no, no!

07:57.530 --> 07:59.482
Saunders sees I've brought
C.T.U. Into this, he kills Michelle!

07:59.610 --> 08:02.074
He's not gonna know we're there.

08:03.707 --> 08:05.466
Tony, where are you meeting him?

08:07.227 --> 08:10.044
Tony, you don't have a choice right now.
You've gotta work with me on this.

08:10.139 --> 08:12.860
Where is the meeting?

08:12.956 --> 08:16.828
Come on. Where are you meeting him?

08:19.165 --> 08:22.620
He wants me to be at a public pay phone at
the corner ofTaylor and Vine in five minutes.

08:22.749 --> 08:25.245
He'll give me
further instructions from there.

08:29.150 --> 08:31.773
Thank you. You're doing the right thing.

08:54.815 --> 08:56.641
The quarantined areas are circled in red.

08:56.738 --> 08:58.753
Now as far as we know,
we have containment.

08:58.881 --> 09:02.465
- We're still not certain?
- No. But we can't really be certain for hours.

09:02.561 --> 09:06.018
Maybe days. David, listen. The press is
breathing down Jerry's neck pretty hard.

09:06.145 --> 09:08.770
- Now, he thinks we should release a statement.
- I already have.

09:08.866 --> 09:11.010
I've closed down public transportation...

09:11.106 --> 09:13.474
and I've told the people
to stay in their homes.

09:13.571 --> 09:15.747
We have F-18s patrolling the skies.

09:15.844 --> 09:18.532
Yeah, but we haven't revealed
the exact nature of this threat...

09:18.625 --> 09:20.451
and the press is picking up on that.

09:20.546 --> 09:25.028
We have 10 million people
spread out over a 4,000 square mile area.

09:25.124 --> 09:28.580
If even a small percentage
decide to leave at the same time...

09:28.707 --> 09:32.677
it will ignite a public panic beyond
anything we could control.

09:32.772 --> 09:37.221
The right thing to do is to withhold the truth
until we're sure the virus is contained.

09:37.349 --> 09:41.125
I'll tell Jerry to hold off on the press
as long as he can.

09:46.181 --> 09:50.280
" Mr. President."

09:50.374 --> 09:54.855
- Yes, Jeannie?
- Senator Keeler's here to see you.

09:57.063 --> 10:00.039
- Have him brought in.
- "Yes, sir."

10:07.944 --> 10:10.536
- In here, sir.
- " Thank you."

10:13.738 --> 10:16.232
- Hello, John.
- Mr. President.

10:16.361 --> 10:19.337
- "Please, take a seat."
- Thank you, I'll stand.

10:19.466 --> 10:24.361
You can imagine my surprise when I was told
that you wanted to see me.

10:24.489 --> 10:26.377
Are you withdrawing from the race?

10:26.506 --> 10:31.084
Mr. President, with respect to
the death of Alan Milliken...

10:31.179 --> 10:34.347
I know you lied to the police.

10:34.442 --> 10:39.051
- Excuse me?
- You obstructed the investigation
of a capital crime.

10:41.003 --> 10:43.853
That's a baseless charge, John...

10:43.949 --> 10:47.245
though I've come to expect
this kind of recklessness from you.

10:47.373 --> 10:51.790
No, sir. It is neither baseless
nor reckless.

10:54.732 --> 10:57.518
This is a photograph of
the nitroglycerin medicine...

10:57.612 --> 11:00.877
that would've saved Milliken's life...

11:00.973 --> 11:03.566
if it hadn't been kept from him.

11:07.470 --> 11:11.696
You told the police Sherry was with you
at the time of Milliken's death.

11:11.792 --> 11:15.247
Her fingerprints on this
prescription bottle prove otherwise.

11:16.911 --> 11:20.689
Now, the last thing this country needs...

11:20.816 --> 11:25.904
is to have its president dragged through
the mud for complicity in a murder.

11:27.697 --> 11:30.674
Why are you showing me this, John?
What do you want?

11:30.801 --> 11:33.104
Your resignation.

11:34.897 --> 11:36.721
Not immediately, of course.

11:38.513 --> 11:41.971
But once this crisis
you're dealing with is over...

11:42.098 --> 11:45.555
you can resign with whatever face-saving
reason you want to give.

11:48.306 --> 11:50.132
Get out of here.

11:51.764 --> 11:54.612
I'm offering you the chance
to leave office with honor.

11:54.708 --> 11:56.531
To control how your legacy
is written.

12:02.646 --> 12:07.478
It's a good deal, David.
You should take it.

12:36.311 --> 12:39.033
- He's gonna call in one minute.
I should go to the phone.
- Okay.

12:39.128 --> 12:42.426
As soon as Saunders tells you where he wants
the exchange, you need to reject the location.

12:42.521 --> 12:45.817
Force him into picking a secondary location,
so Chase has time to embed his teams.

12:45.913 --> 12:48.987
If I don't show up where and when Saunders
wants me to, he's gonna kill Michelle.

12:49.082 --> 12:53.209
- Not as long as we have his daughter.
- What if he doesn't go for it?

12:53.305 --> 12:55.674
Don't give him a choice.
You've got some leverage here, Tony, use it.

12:57.851 --> 12:59.676
All right. I need to go.

13:15.549 --> 13:18.716
My father kidnapped
his wife because of me?

13:18.812 --> 13:20.637
Something like that.

13:22.270 --> 13:24.863
And now you wanna use me
as bait to get to him?

13:24.959 --> 13:28.477
We're gonna do whatever we have to
to stop your father from releasing this virus.

13:32.543 --> 13:35.039
Stay here. We'll be right back.

13:56.994 --> 14:00.322
- Where are we meeting?
- First let me speak with my daughter.

14:00.449 --> 14:03.363
No. You can talk to her
when we make the exchange.

14:05.539 --> 14:08.385
All right. Bring her to
an industrial park...

14:08.481 --> 14:11.330
three miles north of
where you are, on Morton Road.

14:11.427 --> 14:13.668
A car will be waiting
at loading dock 22.

14:13.763 --> 14:16.738
Choose a new place. That doesn't work.

14:16.866 --> 14:19.555
Make it work.
You've got 10 minutes...

14:19.652 --> 14:22.501
to get to the industrial park
or your wife will die.

14:22.596 --> 14:24.964
- If we meet there, we all die.
- Really?

14:25.061 --> 14:27.427
C.T.U. Has redundant
satellite surveillance of that area.

14:27.524 --> 14:29.701
They're dedicating all their resources
to finding me right now.

14:29.796 --> 14:32.164
If you want your daughter back safely,
you pick a new spot.

14:32.260 --> 14:36.998
I am not negotiating terms, Mr. Almeida.
I've planned too long and too hard for this day.

14:37.126 --> 14:40.486
I will do whatever it takes
to make sure nothing interferes.

14:40.613 --> 14:45.511
Even... Even if it means
sacrificing my daughter.

14:47.492 --> 14:49.895
You need to understand
my commitment, Mr. Al...

14:50.022 --> 14:52.230
- What the hell are you doing?
He wasn't going for it.
- He's testing you.

14:52.326 --> 14:55.431
- He's heard what you had to say.
He'll phone back. Hang up.
- How do you know?

14:55.527 --> 14:59.240
Because he thinks I'm gonna kill his daughter.
The only reason why he exposed himself...

14:59.337 --> 15:02.217
- is to make sure that she's still safe.
- Maybe that's what you'd do.

15:02.345 --> 15:05.639
You're not Saunders. No matter how well
you think you know this guy, you're not him.

15:05.768 --> 15:08.073
This isn't a game, Jack.
We're talking about my wife.

15:08.168 --> 15:11.209
Michelle's got a better chance of surviving
if we control the ground...

15:11.305 --> 15:14.953
- where the exchange takes place.
- But protecting her is not your priority, is it?

15:15.049 --> 15:18.187
If she were to get killed, that
would be an acceptable loss, wouldn't it?

15:20.298 --> 15:22.026
My God, Jack.

15:22.123 --> 15:24.970
Didn't you learn anything
from what happened to Teri?

15:25.098 --> 15:28.682
Shut up, Tony. Shut up!

15:37.612 --> 15:42.061
- Tony!
- Just because you sacrificed your wife for this job...

15:42.188 --> 15:45.036
doesn't mean
I'm going to sacrifice mine!

16:05.935 --> 16:09.008
- I'm here.
- Make no mistake.

16:09.104 --> 16:11.279
This is your first
and your last accommodation.

16:11.375 --> 16:13.232
Yeah, just tell me where
you wanna make the exchange.

16:13.327 --> 16:17.137
Downtown, under
the Sixth Street Bridge.

16:17.264 --> 16:21.135
- Under the Sixth Street Bridge.
- Be there in 30 minutes.

16:21.264 --> 16:23.728
But if I see you've brought
anyone else into this...

16:23.856 --> 16:26.225
I will kill your wife.

16:28.817 --> 16:32.114
You did great.

16:52.852 --> 16:55.348
Tony Almeida's gonna make the exchange,
but until we get confirmation...

16:55.476 --> 16:57.845
that Saunders is on-site, we stay invisible.

16:57.941 --> 17:00.436
I'll assign positions on the way out. Let's go.

17:03.637 --> 17:06.005
- What is it?
- Satellite pictures of Sixth Street Bridge.

17:06.103 --> 17:09.557
- I asked for real-time feed. Sam.
- We'll have it to you by
the time you're on-site.

17:09.685 --> 17:12.790
- What about air support?
- We're coordinating with the marines.

17:12.887 --> 17:15.958
They'll move on your order. Look, Chase...

17:16.054 --> 17:18.423
please be careful.

17:21.047 --> 17:23.253
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

17:28.633 --> 17:32.888
Chloe, how much time before you can
set up a real-time satellite feed...

17:33.017 --> 17:35.385
for the Sixth Street Bridge?

17:35.481 --> 17:39.609
Do you really think Chase is going to
quit Field Ops to start a family?

17:39.738 --> 17:43.160
- He won't.
- I don't know where you're getting this from...

17:43.289 --> 17:45.978
- but it's none of your business.
- I've known Chase for three years.

17:46.075 --> 17:49.369
- You've been dating him for three months.
- And your point being?

17:49.498 --> 17:52.955
He might be a great guy, but he's just like
your father. They're both the same person.

17:53.083 --> 17:56.698
So if you're expecting him to leave this for
the suburbs, you should revise your expectations.

17:59.258 --> 18:01.147
When can you uplink a satellite feed?

18:01.243 --> 18:03.612
- Ten minutes.
- Then do it.

18:03.739 --> 18:05.595
I'm just trying to be
a friend, Kim. That's all.

18:11.293 --> 18:14.749
Hello?

18:14.877 --> 18:16.764
You've gone too far this time, Sherry.

18:16.893 --> 18:19.550
You know, l-I thought
I might be hearing from you, David.

18:19.645 --> 18:23.357
You sent Keeler over here to blackmail me
into giving up my presidency?

18:23.454 --> 18:26.430
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.
You mean Keeler paid you a visit?

18:26.559 --> 18:29.406
You know damn well he did,
and you know why.

18:29.501 --> 18:32.606
Only one person could've given him
that prescription bottle and that's you.

18:32.703 --> 18:34.943
Okay. Supposing
that was true. What then?

18:35.039 --> 18:38.206
- You could go to jail for murder.
- You could go to jail too.

18:38.302 --> 18:41.119
You lied to the police.
You told them that I was with you all night.

18:41.215 --> 18:43.711
Withholding evidence?
Obstruction of justice?

18:43.841 --> 18:45.856
Those are serious crimes.

18:45.984 --> 18:48.289
I knew you always wanted to
go down in the history books, David...

18:48.384 --> 18:52.065
- but I'm not certain like this, am I right?
- What did Keeler offer you?

18:52.161 --> 18:56.577
Exactly what you should've offered me.
Respect and a seat at the table.

18:56.705 --> 18:58.689
But instead, you called me up
when you needed me...

18:58.817 --> 19:03.233
and then after I did your little dirty work,
you threw me out like an old pair of shoes.

19:03.362 --> 19:07.843
You know me, Sherry.
Better than anyone.

19:07.939 --> 19:11.011
And you know I won't be bullied.

19:11.107 --> 19:14.819
So before this goes too far,
you better ask yourself a question.

19:14.915 --> 19:16.835
Are you willing to go to jail?

19:16.963 --> 19:20.676
You know, David,
I've asked myself that a million times.

19:20.771 --> 19:24.070
And the answer is, yes,
I am willing to go to jail.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.852
The question is, are you?

19:28.644 --> 19:32.324
I didn't think so.

19:42.950 --> 19:45.158
I want the strike team
split into two groups.

19:45.254 --> 19:47.656
Group "A" can take cover
here. Group "B" back here.

19:47.783 --> 19:49.927
I want them briefed and ready to go
as soon as we get there.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.678
If Saunders sees anyone other than Tony or
his daughter, he's not gonna make the approach.

19:52.774 --> 19:55.430
- What's the response time for air support?
- "Thirty seconds after the order."

19:55.528 --> 19:57.576
- I'll relay the coordinates.
- I'll see you at the bridge.

19:57.705 --> 19:59.560
You got it.

20:01.352 --> 20:06.090
I know my father released the virus
in the hotel. That people died.

20:07.562 --> 20:11.017
But do you really think
he'll do what he's saying?

20:12.137 --> 20:15.273
Release it all over the country?

20:16.810 --> 20:21.611
- If we don't stop him, yes.
- Why?

20:21.739 --> 20:24.811
There has to be a reason
he's doing all this.

20:24.906 --> 20:29.324
When I worked with your father, he dedicated
himself to saving the lives of innocent people.

20:29.452 --> 20:33.291
Something's happened to him.
I don't know what.

20:33.419 --> 20:36.267
But now he believes
our government's betrayed him.

20:36.364 --> 20:38.732
Is he right?

20:41.933 --> 20:45.038
There's no easy answer to that.

20:45.134 --> 20:49.133
The work that your father did
often demanded that...

20:49.229 --> 20:51.405
he make seemingly impossible sacrifices.

20:51.502 --> 20:56.462
Whatever happened to your father in Bosnia
was a sacrifice he wasn't willing to make.

20:58.287 --> 21:00.111
I'm sorry.

21:04.367 --> 21:06.575
- No!
- Shut up!

21:06.671 --> 21:09.359
- No one can hear you.
- Oh, my God! No!

21:09.455 --> 21:11.600
- Shut up now!
- No!

21:16.112 --> 21:17.968
- No. Oh, God.
- I said stop.

21:18.065 --> 21:19.825
Stop screaming.

21:21.458 --> 21:24.689
Look at me.
I've been infected.

21:24.785 --> 21:29.009
Help me. Help me. Oh, God.

21:32.305 --> 21:35.027
No.

21:35.122 --> 21:37.138
- We've got a problem here.
- What's going on?

21:37.267 --> 21:40.626
- She has it. She has the virus.
- What are you talking about?

21:40.754 --> 21:43.668
She's bleeding. She must have caught it
at the hotel.

21:43.795 --> 21:46.963
They wouldn't have released her
without testing her. It's a trick.

21:47.059 --> 21:48.595
She did it to herself.

21:50.516 --> 21:54.708
Kevin, you there? Kevin?

22:24.440 --> 22:26.264
Okay. Take the east corridor.

22:26.360 --> 22:29.016
Stop her from getting aboveground,
but do not shoot to kill.

23:51.810 --> 23:53.698
C.T.U. O'Brian.

23:53.793 --> 23:55.617
Chloe, it's me. It's Michelle.

23:55.715 --> 23:59.233
- Hello?
- Chloe, can you hear me?

23:59.361 --> 24:02.274
Whoever this is, I have a really bad connection.
I've got a lot of stuff do.

24:02.402 --> 24:04.259
Chloe.

24:31.076 --> 24:34.853
- So what did Keeler want?
- My job.

24:36.519 --> 24:39.942
He has proof that Sherry was
at Alan Milliken's tonight.

24:40.069 --> 24:43.142
What? Wh-What proof?

24:45.255 --> 24:50.151
Alan Milliken's prescription bottle turned up
with Sherry's fingerprints on it.

24:52.263 --> 24:55.368
- How'd he get a hold of this?
- How do you think?

24:55.464 --> 24:57.448
Sherry?

25:00.872 --> 25:04.424
I talked to her a few minutes ago.
She didn't even bother to deny it.

25:04.520 --> 25:07.370
David, she's gotta be bluffing.
I mean, if this gets out, she goes to jail.

25:07.465 --> 25:10.346
So will I.

25:10.475 --> 25:13.321
She figures I have
more to lose than she does.

25:13.418 --> 25:15.562
And she's right.

25:17.067 --> 25:21.290
- What does Keeler want you to do?
- Withdraw from the race.

25:21.386 --> 25:25.324
For whatever reason I choose.
The party gets thrown into chaos.

25:25.451 --> 25:29.644
Whoever takes my place
won't have a prayer in the election.

25:29.739 --> 25:32.300
And Keeler becomes president.

25:34.509 --> 25:36.652
Oh, my God.

25:39.083 --> 25:41.741
This is all my fault.

25:41.836 --> 25:45.133
Hey, look.

25:45.261 --> 25:47.085
We both made mistakes.

25:51.118 --> 25:53.326
I'm the one who called Sherry.

26:01.903 --> 26:05.263
- There may be a way out of this.
- How?

26:06.863 --> 26:10.704
- Without this, Sherry's got nothing, right?
- What are you suggesting?

26:10.831 --> 26:12.784
That we take away
the only leverage she has.

26:12.913 --> 26:15.728
You mean steal evidence?

26:17.584 --> 26:21.617
- My God, Wayne.
- Before you say no, you just think about this, okay?

26:21.714 --> 26:24.114
Now, I can call Foxton,
and he can make this all disappear.

26:24.241 --> 26:26.610
All you have to do is give me the okay.

27:06.551 --> 27:09.334
- You stay with her.
- "Yes, sir."

27:09.431 --> 27:10.839
I need a headset.

27:10.935 --> 27:13.271
- Is your strike team in place?
- Two minutes they'll be ready.

27:13.367 --> 27:16.438
- Are you sure they'll be out of sight?
- They'll be invisible, Tony.

27:16.534 --> 27:19.256
- Okay. I'm gonna back Tony up
at the Sixth Street Bridge.
- We should get in position.

27:19.352 --> 27:21.656
Jack, priority call from Kim.

27:21.752 --> 27:24.279
- This is Jack.
- Dad, I got Michelle on the line.

27:24.407 --> 27:26.777
- Is she with Saunders?
- No. She said she got away from him.

27:26.872 --> 27:29.850
- Patch her through.
- Hold on.

27:32.248 --> 27:35.896
- Michelle, go ahead.
- I got away from Saunders, but he's still after me.

27:35.993 --> 27:38.299
Michelle, it's me. Where are you?

27:38.393 --> 27:42.554
Uh, Wilshire. A block east of Olive.

27:42.650 --> 27:44.539
- Chase, send your strike team in now.
- Chase, don't.

27:44.635 --> 27:47.419
- What are you talking about?
- Michelle, I want you to listen to me very carefully.

27:47.515 --> 27:50.906
- I want you to let Saunders catch you again.
- What, are you crazy?

27:51.034 --> 27:53.723
We have to let the exchange go down.
It's the only way we're gonna catch him.

27:53.819 --> 27:57.467
- You want me to give myself up?
- The exchange site is secure.

27:57.563 --> 28:00.924
- I'll send our people in
as soon as we know he's there.
- Chase, redirect your people.

28:01.051 --> 28:02.461
- Chase, that's an order.
- "Chase, don't!"

28:02.557 --> 28:05.052
Jack, stay out of this!

28:05.180 --> 28:07.356
You are not in command here!
Get him out of here now!

28:07.454 --> 28:09.278
- Yes, sir.
- Now!

28:09.373 --> 28:11.997
Jack. That's my wife, Jack!
You son of a bitch!

28:12.093 --> 28:15.038
My wife! Jack!

28:15.166 --> 28:17.759
We need this exchange to go through.
Everything depends on it.

28:17.853 --> 28:20.607
Do you understand me?

28:20.700 --> 28:24.863
Michelle, if he doesn't have you to trade,
he's not gonna go through with this meeting.

28:24.958 --> 28:27.808
Look, we're not gonna get another chance
at this. Do you understand, Michelle?

28:28.865 --> 28:30.686
Yes.

28:30.782 --> 28:33.632
We're gonna do everything we have to
to make sure you come out of this okay.

28:33.728 --> 28:36.960
But we gotta move now.
Let's get our teams into position.

29:36.839 --> 29:39.527
And I thought your brother
was the kind of politician...

29:39.623 --> 29:41.673
who would never lower himself
to my level.

29:43.654 --> 29:46.695
I need to recover something that could
cause him a great deal of trouble.

29:46.792 --> 29:49.159
- What is it?
- A bottle of medicine.

29:49.256 --> 29:52.392
- It was taken from a crime scene.
- Has it been admitted into evidence?

29:52.488 --> 29:54.696
No.

29:54.792 --> 29:57.642
It's in the possession of Sherry Palmer,
the president's ex-wife.

29:59.209 --> 30:01.289
I have a pretty good idea
of where she is right now...

30:01.416 --> 30:03.626
and I can partially reconstruct
where she's been since she stole it.

30:03.721 --> 30:07.881
- What kind of time frame are we looking at?
- Hours, Foxton. Not days.

30:07.977 --> 30:12.843
Has this, uh, operation
been authorized by the president?

30:14.987 --> 30:17.195
What difference does that make?
You'll get your money.

30:17.291 --> 30:20.684
I'm not worried about that.
I just need to know who I'm working for.

30:21.835 --> 30:23.660
My brother knows what you're doing.

30:25.611 --> 30:29.868
Not that I don't trust you, but
I'd like to hear it from him.

30:30.956 --> 30:32.780
Fine.

30:37.165 --> 30:39.790
That's proof enough.

30:44.780 --> 30:46.606
Let's go.

30:55.439 --> 30:57.230
Chase's men have Saunders yet?

30:59.023 --> 31:01.711
No one's coming yet.

31:15.537 --> 31:20.915
Look, Jack, promise me you won't make
a move on Saunders until Michelle is safe.

31:21.043 --> 31:23.474
We're going to move as soon as
we've got a visual on Saunders, Tony.

31:23.601 --> 31:28.915
- That's the way it's gotta go.
- I know.

31:29.043 --> 31:32.435
I'm just asking you
just to do what you can.

31:32.563 --> 31:35.668
- You know I will.
- " Copy that."

31:38.803 --> 31:40.755
We've got three cars
heading in from the west.

31:42.867 --> 31:46.259
- Tony, they're coming. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

32:04.022 --> 32:06.229
The windows are tinted.
I can't see inside.

32:26.872 --> 32:28.697
- Yeah.
- Give her the phone.

32:32.570 --> 32:36.058
My preference is to turn you over to
your husband unharmed.

32:36.185 --> 32:38.682
But I will kill you if anything goes wrong.

33:13.822 --> 33:16.190
Yeah?

33:16.287 --> 33:20.958
- When I see my daughter, you get your wife.
- All right.

33:24.511 --> 33:27.679
Jane, I need you to get out of the car.

33:34.976 --> 33:37.824
Everything's gonna be okay.

33:43.329 --> 33:46.978
- I want you to walk over to your father's men.
- Where's my father?

33:48.355 --> 33:53.571
We don't know. Listen,
we have to do this, Jane.

33:54.595 --> 33:56.386
I'm sorry.

34:00.162 --> 34:02.626
Look, Jane. You gotta trust me on this.
Please, go.

34:04.387 --> 34:07.107
Go on.

34:33.382 --> 34:36.646
- Jack, send your men in now.
- We don't have a visual on Saunders.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.469
I repeat, we do not have
a visual on Saunders.

35:01.226 --> 35:03.497
- I can't.
- Hey, come here!

35:03.593 --> 35:06.859
- Jane, no! Turn around!
- Jane! It's okay. Come here!

35:06.954 --> 35:09.035
Teams "A" and "B" move.
We've got a visual on Saunders.

35:09.164 --> 35:10.987
- Move now!
- "Jane!"

35:37.517 --> 35:39.853
Stephen!

35:54.351 --> 35:56.367
Stephen!

36:05.329 --> 36:08.690
I'm pinned down. Saunders has a helicopter.
Call in air support now.

36:08.818 --> 36:12.305
- "I repeat, call in air support!"
- I need air support!

36:12.433 --> 36:15.186
I've got a flight of two U.S. Marine F-18s
just off the marina.

36:15.281 --> 36:17.361
- Call sign Guardian Angel.
- Copy that.

36:17.489 --> 36:20.307
Guardian Angel. Guardian Angel.
This is Watchtower.

36:20.402 --> 36:22.547
We got hostile aircraft
at vector Bravo Tango.

36:34.835 --> 36:37.684
Jack, marines are coming in.
Take cover. I repeat, take cover.

36:54.741 --> 36:56.213
Let's go! Let's go!

37:06.645 --> 37:08.630
Chopper's been taken out.

37:19.960 --> 37:21.593
- You okay?
- Yeah.

37:57.340 --> 37:59.196
Don't move!

37:59.293 --> 38:02.077
Eleven vials of the virus
are unaccounted for. Where are they?

38:02.174 --> 38:04.861
It's not gonna be that simple, Jack.

38:04.956 --> 38:08.733
- Stephen, it's over.
- No, it's not, Jack.

38:08.861 --> 38:11.230
It's just beginning.

38:13.374 --> 38:15.455
Where are the vials?

38:15.582 --> 38:19.519
You can waste time
trying to break me...

38:19.647 --> 38:21.439
and kill millions of people.

38:23.742 --> 38:25.631
Or you can give me what I want.

38:31.136 --> 38:32.672
This is Jack Bauer.

38:32.800 --> 38:35.072
Saunders is in custody.

38:36.305 --> 38:42.484
