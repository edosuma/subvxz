03:21.351 --> 03:23.477

03:23.559 --> 03:24.852

03:27.073 --> 03:28.935
I got a winner,
I've done it before.

03:29.017 --> 03:30.643
And you lost everything before!

03:30.726 --> 03:32.977
It's like a 7 to 1.
No one knows you got the win race...

03:33.059 --> 03:33.977
...since last time.

03:34.059 --> 03:38.560

- Come on, Amir, don't do this.

03:38.642 --> 03:39.642

03:39.684 --> 03:43.143
Look, I don't know what
happened to you Alec. You changed.

03:43.267 --> 03:46.352
You're a good man,
but you need some help.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.518
I'm fine! I can fix...

03:48.809 --> 03:49.809

- I got phone call from you.
- Yes, right this way.

04:08.059 --> 04:09.310
I imagine you must be...

04:09.392 --> 04:12.435
...quite surprised to get our called
about meeting today.

04:12.517 --> 04:14.435
- Yeah, I ...
- Seeing as you bounds...

04:14.517 --> 04:16.930
five checks when you
had your account here.

04:16.951 --> 04:18.485
Not to mention your Visa,

04:18.567 --> 04:20.510
Which had to be canceled twice

04:20.522 --> 04:22.977
because you manage somehow
to keep ramping up charges.

04:23.059 --> 04:26.643
Bollocks, I paid all that off.
So, why am I here?

04:26.726 --> 04:30.893
There is someone who is willing
to eradicate all your debts.

04:30.976 --> 04:32.477
Is this a joke?

04:32.559 --> 04:34.935
It should be. It's not.

04:35.559 --> 04:38.143
Alright, who is this person?

04:38.267 --> 04:39.560
A family member.

04:39.642 --> 04:41.518
Ahh, family member, right.

04:41.601 --> 04:45.060
Well, both my parent are long dead,
as is my only brother,

04:45.142 --> 04:47.143
and the last I heard
of a relative...

04:47.267 --> 04:50.060
It was in my First Communion.
So, how do you gonna explain that?

04:50.142 --> 04:53.227
- Well this is an uncle, you've never met.
- That convenient.

04:53.309 --> 04:55.227
Mr. Raymond Heacock.

04:59.059 --> 05:01.685
Yeah, That's my mother's maiden name.

05:02.434 --> 05:04.955
He will be at his private club...

05:04.990 --> 05:07.477
table under his name,
today at one P.M. ...

05:07.559 --> 05:08.852
Sharp.

05:23.017 --> 05:24.602
Thank you, Svetlana.

05:26.851 --> 05:27.893
Alec.

05:28.726 --> 05:29.726
Sit down.

05:31.851 --> 05:32.851
Hungry?

05:33.892 --> 05:35.518
- A little, yeah.
- Good.

05:35.601 --> 05:39.977
I have ordered you the escargot and sole,
they do it well here.

05:40.309 --> 05:41.560
He won't be having any,
thank you.

05:45.767 --> 05:47.893
You must be curious.

05:48.517 --> 05:49.518
Ask away.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.852
You're my uncle?

05:52.934 --> 05:56.518
Indeed.
Your dear mother was my sister.

05:56.601 --> 05:58.852
Then how come I
never heard of you?

05:59.934 --> 06:01.893
Sadly, we rarely spoked.

06:01.976 --> 06:04.643
There were a couple of things
we couldn't agree on.

06:04.726 --> 06:05.726
Such as?

06:05.767 --> 06:08.018
Well, that one I'm not
prepared to answer.

06:12.767 --> 06:16.102
Bank said that you
gonna give me all this money.

06:16.726 --> 06:18.810
Well, that not exactly right.

06:20.517 --> 06:22.018
Can I be open with you?

06:22.101 --> 06:23.227
Sure.

06:23.309 --> 06:25.685
Frankly, you are a
disgrace to the family.

06:25.767 --> 06:27.872
Your gambling habits that rely
to get you killed or ...

06:27.907 --> 06:29.977
the very least maimed.

06:30.559 --> 06:32.685
You never married and
you sleeping around...

06:32.767 --> 06:34.727
As if you just
discovered your willy.

06:34.809 --> 06:38.727
As for your Engineering degree,
your business is a disaster.

06:38.809 --> 06:40.393
What am I doing here?

06:41.684 --> 06:44.268
I'm prepared to pay off
all debts.

06:44.351 --> 06:45.852
Every single one of them.

06:45.934 --> 06:48.435
Which at this moment in time...

06:48.601 --> 06:51.143
amount to exactly...

06:52.351 --> 06:56.102
88,950 pounds.

06:57.226 --> 06:58.602
So, you see.

06:58.684 --> 07:00.060
It's not all bad.

07:00.934 --> 07:04.518
Of course, I want something in exchange.
- What?

07:04.601 --> 07:07.727
I want you to move
abroad, leave England.

07:08.684 --> 07:10.227
Leave England?

07:10.309 --> 07:12.560
- Where?
- You will be living in Nova Scotia.

07:13.476 --> 07:16.685
- That's Canada, if you don't know where it is.
- Why?

07:16.767 --> 07:19.935
Well, we had family living there
for the past 200 years...

07:20.017 --> 07:23.268
and, frankly, where we getting a bit
thin on the ground

07:23.351 --> 07:26.768
It's a tradition I want to maintain...

07:26.851 --> 07:28.268
Napkin.

07:28.934 --> 07:29.934
Thank you.

07:30.392 --> 07:32.352
365 days.

07:32.684 --> 07:33.893
Not a day less.

07:34.559 --> 07:36.518
And then, if you're not happy,

07:36.601 --> 07:39.039
Well, you can always return to England
and pick up...

07:39.074 --> 07:41.477
your debauch life
where you left off...

07:41.559 --> 07:43.852
And, by the way, you'll be leaving on Monday.

07:44.351 --> 07:45.935
That's on two days!

07:46.017 --> 07:49.768
Yes. Hopefully, your friends won't
kill you by then.

07:49.851 --> 07:54.060
Now, Here is your tickets to Halifax.

07:54.142 --> 07:56.685
You'll be meated on the airport by
a man name Frederick.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.018
He's worked for
me for a number of years,

07:59.101 --> 08:01.518
He looks after my house where
you'll be staying.

08:01.601 --> 08:06.268
Now, there is work papers
and a Visa that last a year.

08:06.559 --> 08:09.060
- What am I supposed to do there?
- Could always try working?

08:09.142 --> 08:10.143
Doing what?

08:10.267 --> 08:11.685
Not my problem, dear boy.

08:12.017 --> 08:15.018
So, Monday, 13:05,
your plane leave.

08:15.101 --> 08:17.310
Be on it or the deal is off.

08:17.726 --> 08:18.935
Now, I really must go.

08:19.434 --> 08:21.727
Enjoy your meal, it's all paid for.

08:22.809 --> 08:27.810
I'm really sorry about your
brother, such a shame.

08:34.226 --> 08:38.727
By the way Alec, ever notice anything
strange about yourself?

08:39.351 --> 08:40.351
Odd?

08:40.767 --> 08:41.852
Odd?

08:43.392 --> 08:44.518
Nevermind.

08:45.976 --> 08:47.018
Good luck.

09:00.101 --> 09:01.102
Thanks.

09:01.601 --> 09:05.102
So I say, you get the plane ticket,
get it refunded.

09:05.226 --> 09:07.268
Should be closer what you owe
to those Russians.

09:07.351 --> 09:08.526
And you tell your uncle to bugger off.

09:08.526 --> 09:10.602
What is wrong with you?
I'm not gonna rob my uncle.

09:10.684 --> 09:11.684
And I just met him.

09:12.351 --> 09:14.893
Beside, he's like the only family got.

09:15.309 --> 09:17.893
You've checked, right?
Can it get refunded.

09:17.976 --> 09:19.102
Yeah, I checked.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.810
But that beside the point.

09:22.851 --> 09:25.685
I'm not gonna go to Canada.
This is ridiculous.

09:25.851 --> 09:28.268
I reckon if Charlie was here,
He tell you to go.

09:28.351 --> 09:30.602
- You don't talk about my brother!
- Alright mate.

09:30.684 --> 09:32.102
I'm serious.
You don't talk about Charlie!

09:32.226 --> 09:33.893
Okay, I'm sorry...

09:34.601 --> 09:35.768
Shit!

09:40.101 --> 09:41.977
So, Alec...

09:43.267 --> 09:45.268
If you are drinking
beers with friends,

09:47.059 --> 09:52.352
It means, you have the
money for Mr. Masic?

09:52.434 --> 09:55.352
Leave him alone! Alright.
He's gonna get your bloody money!

09:57.142 --> 09:58.893
Shit!

10:18.309 --> 10:20.518
Alec, playing games...

10:22.309 --> 10:23.810
Oh, shit!

10:46.267 --> 10:49.268
- Tell me your sins, my son.
- Jesus Christ!

10:49.767 --> 10:52.268
We'll have to adore to what ever
else you confess.

10:52.601 --> 10:55.310
I'm just hiding here.
Okay.

10:55.392 --> 10:57.810
This is a sacred
sacrament, get out!

10:57.892 --> 10:59.768
No, please, they gonna kill me.

10:59.851 --> 11:04.685
- Who wants to harm you?
- Nobody, just slow your voice.

11:05.142 --> 11:06.935
Now tell me what you've done.

11:07.017 --> 11:08.060
I owe them money.

11:08.142 --> 11:09.810
- What you stole?
- No!

11:09.934 --> 11:10.935
I gamble it

11:16.517 --> 11:17.810
Wait, wait...

11:20.559 --> 11:23.018
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have to close now.

11:26.184 --> 11:28.060
This is the house of the Lord.

11:28.267 --> 11:30.685
I don't believe either one
of you is praying.

11:30.892 --> 11:34.477
So, will you brought your businesses
elsewhere, Please.

11:57.309 --> 11:58.309
Thanks.

11:58.559 --> 12:03.060
Stay for a while, those men aren't
gonna go away just like that.

12:03.267 --> 12:06.518
Come here and tell me what's
going on with you.

12:07.142 --> 12:09.310
Maybe I can give you some advise.

12:09.392 --> 12:11.060
Look, Father, I just...

12:11.142 --> 12:12.142
Sit down!

12:13.476 --> 12:15.018
You owe me this at least.

12:15.101 --> 12:16.435
Sit and talk.

12:19.976 --> 12:22.852
It seems your life
is not going well, is it?

12:24.184 --> 12:26.518
I think you should move to Canada.

12:26.601 --> 12:29.518
I think it's God ways of
giving you a second chance.

12:29.601 --> 12:32.018
Trust me, my uncle doesn't work for God.

12:32.267 --> 12:36.185
- Let me tell you a story.
- No, please, Father. I'm gonna go.

12:39.392 --> 12:42.268
There was is this parish
priest in a church.

12:42.351 --> 12:46.935
And the rain was so bad for a month,
that the town was flooded.

12:47.101 --> 12:48.852
And people were force to leave,

12:49.351 --> 12:52.477
but the priest said:
"God will save me!",

12:52.559 --> 12:54.060
so he stayed behind...

12:54.142 --> 12:56.434
Now, when the water was up to his waist,

12:56.469 --> 12:58.727
they sent the police to evacuate him,

12:59.059 --> 13:02.893
and then they sent him the fireman,
and the army with a boat,

13:03.309 --> 13:08.935
and always he refused, believing the God
would be the one to save him.

13:10.392 --> 13:11.727
and so he drowned.

13:15.642 --> 13:19.310
And when he come face to face with
God, he complained, he said:

13:19.392 --> 13:22.268
"God, why did you abandon me?"

13:23.226 --> 13:28.518
And God said: "I sent the
Police, and the firemen,

13:29.101 --> 13:33.768
and even the army with a boat
but still you would not listen."

13:37.267 --> 13:39.268
I think God sent your uncle.

13:40.976 --> 13:42.268
Go to Canada.

14:16.517 --> 14:17.602
That's me...

14:19.392 --> 14:21.685
I'm Frederick.
Welcome to Nova Scotia.

14:33.517 --> 14:36.310
So, are you from Nova Scotia?

14:37.267 --> 14:38.310
Yes.

14:41.226 --> 14:43.227
And how long have you known my uncle?

14:44.476 --> 14:46.060
43 years.

14:48.101 --> 14:49.643
Wow, I only just met him.

15:37.017 --> 15:39.518
So, there is a few things
about this house you should know.

15:39.642 --> 15:43.143
Sometimes the furnace breaks down,
let me know if it does but don't kick it.

15:43.226 --> 15:46.060
Fridge is not great,
but your food won't spoil

15:46.142 --> 15:48.768
You got one phone,
washer on the back.

15:48.976 --> 15:50.685
Don't over loaded it will flood.

15:50.767 --> 15:53.602
The bed is made, it a bit squeaky,
you'll get used to that.

15:53.684 --> 15:55.727
Fresh linen and towels is on the closet.

15:56.226 --> 15:57.226
Got any questions?

15:57.392 --> 15:59.643
Yeah. Is there any Internet?

15:59.726 --> 16:00.726
No.

16:01.809 --> 16:03.018
Where is the nearest town?

16:03.142 --> 16:05.018
Lunenburg, about four kilometers east.

16:05.101 --> 16:06.602
How I supposed to get there?

16:06.684 --> 16:08.518
Well your uncle asked me
to find you a car.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.893
An old fishing buddy of mine
sold me his truck.

16:10.976 --> 16:12.185
Should be delivered in the morning.

16:12.267 --> 16:14.685
- Oh, great, thank you.
- Yeah, thank me when you see it.

16:15.351 --> 16:16.351
Wait wait.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.477
How am I supposed to reach you?

16:18.559 --> 16:20.159
I'll be around.
Numbers on the wall.

16:27.392 --> 16:30.477
Oh, I guess this is me... For a year.

17:00.601 --> 17:02.310
You got to be kidding me?

17:27.851 --> 17:28.977
Jesus!

17:32.434 --> 17:35.768
Nice car!
I hope you like fishing.

17:36.351 --> 17:38.268
Oh, I don't fish.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.893
This... This things should
not be on the road.

17:41.976 --> 17:43.935
- This actually not mine...
- Fred bought it, I know.

17:44.184 --> 17:45.727
You must be Alec.

17:45.809 --> 17:46.560
Yeah.

17:46.642 --> 17:50.018
Hey. I'm Cecilia, I know your uncle, he
told me that you might be coming.

17:50.559 --> 17:52.977
<i>- Oh, Hey.
- Oh. you jet lag?</i>

17:54.059 --> 17:55.227
Yeah, a bit...

17:55.809 --> 17:57.018
Buy you a coffee?

17:57.892 --> 17:58.892
Sure.

18:02.226 --> 18:06.268
- It is just around the corner.
- Is that gonna be alright?

18:06.476 --> 18:09.352
Yeah, no I don't think
anyone be stealing that.

18:12.226 --> 18:13.768
It's ridiculous...

18:15.226 --> 18:16.810
What brought you all the way out here?

18:16.892 --> 18:19.435
I just wanted a change, really.

18:19.517 --> 18:22.060
It was a now or never kind of things,
So...

18:22.392 --> 18:23.643
What do you do?

18:23.851 --> 18:25.518
- I am a vet.
- Oh yeah?

18:25.601 --> 18:27.393
Yeah, mostly farm animals.

18:27.476 --> 18:29.685
I moved here after college.

18:30.017 --> 18:32.352
And your profession is?

18:32.434 --> 18:34.352
I fix things.

18:35.017 --> 18:37.727
I'm a mechanical engineer.

18:37.809 --> 18:41.102
So, I have kinda ability
to fix anything in electrical.

18:41.184 --> 18:42.352
Really?

18:43.726 --> 18:45.518
You know what?
You should put an ad

18:45.601 --> 18:47.518
in the local weekly
newspaper, it's like...

18:47.553 --> 18:49.435
the Bible here.
Everyone reads it.

18:50.976 --> 18:54.893
Yeah. that would really help me out.
I kinda need the money.

18:54.976 --> 18:57.768
They are closed today because
they publish tomorrow.

18:57.934 --> 19:00.768
But I can maybe get your
ad squeezed in there.

19:00.851 --> 19:02.102
The editor is my neighbor.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.143
- Yeah?
- Yeah

19:04.226 --> 19:06.106
- Yeah... That would be great, thank you.

19:06.184 --> 19:07.560
Hang on.

19:07.892 --> 19:11.435
Okay, what do you want to say?

19:12.684 --> 19:17.060
"The Healer, Alec Bailey,
arrives in Lunenburg."

19:17.309 --> 19:20.102
"I fix anything
electrical that's broken".

19:21.017 --> 19:25.518
I'm gonna put your
uncle's house as the address.

19:26.351 --> 19:28.768
"The Healer", I like that.

19:28.851 --> 19:30.102
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

19:30.184 --> 19:33.685

same name back home.

19:34.517 --> 19:35.852
Hi cecilia.

19:36.101 --> 19:37.185

19:37.267 --> 19:40.060
This is Alec, Raymond's nephew,
he just got here.

19:41.434 --> 19:45.060
Welcome to our community.
Your uncle is a very generous man.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.352
Is he?

19:46.434 --> 19:48.143
Will I be seeing you at Sundays Mass?

19:49.309 --> 19:53.060
No, I'm actually a Buddhist.

19:54.559 --> 19:55.559
Buddhist?

19:58.059 --> 19:59.059
Yeah.

19:59.767 --> 20:01.185
And how that come about?

20:02.434 --> 20:05.810
Well, just like you found
Jesus, I found Buddha.

20:06.559 --> 20:07.935
And where is that exactly?

20:08.184 --> 20:10.685
I mean, that you found him?

20:15.026 --> 20:15.830
I found ...

20:15.859 --> 20:18.393
- Father, give the man a break, he just got here.

20:19.601 --> 20:22.435
I'm just kidding. Good luck with that!

20:23.559 --> 20:25.185
- I will you, Cecilia.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.060
Are you really a Buddhist?

20:29.767 --> 20:31.810
No, I been to Thailand.

20:36.142 --> 20:39.435
So, are you married?

20:40.017 --> 20:42.102

20:42.767 --> 20:45.768
No, I actually happen to like...
What you like.

20:47.351 --> 20:49.018
- Really?
- Yeah!

20:50.184 --> 20:53.877
Wow, ah... t-that's great!

20:53.959 --> 20:55.780
I mean maybe I could take you
to a dinner or something...

20:55.768 --> 20:56.977
No, I like women.

20:57.767 --> 20:58.767
What?

20:59.767 --> 21:01.185
Oh, you are a lesbian?

21:01.684 --> 21:03.935
Yes. That's what they call it.

21:04.726 --> 21:06.227
Sorry. I didn't...

21:09.684 --> 21:10.810
Batty, what's up?

21:11.809 --> 21:13.727
Batman, what is it? What's going on?

21:18.726 --> 21:21.352
That is so bizarre.

21:21.809 --> 21:23.893
Are you good with animals?

21:24.934 --> 21:25.977
I don't know.

21:26.351 --> 21:29.518
Well, if fixing things doesn't work out,

21:29.601 --> 21:32.852
You can always come work with me.
I can use the help.

21:32.934 --> 21:34.310
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

21:34.934 --> 21:37.102
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:40.892 --> 21:42.560
Hey, no, no, no...

22:42.601 --> 22:43.602
Oh shit.

I don't mean to...

22:53.226 --> 22:54.226
Beer.

22:57.226 --> 23:00.593
I'mma need your license

23:02.017 --> 23:04.518
I only just moved here.
I been lend this truck.

23:04.601 --> 23:05.852
I know who you are.

23:06.934 --> 23:10.435
You are a Heacock.
Raymond's nephew.

23:10.517 --> 23:12.393
Yeah! You must know my uncle.

23:12.476 --> 23:14.477
You have papers on the vehicle,
yes or no?

23:30.726 --> 23:33.726
I'm give you a citation...

23:33.761 --> 23:36.727
for parking on the side of the road with
emergency lights...

23:37.059 --> 23:38.643
and for drinking and driving.

23:38.726 --> 23:42.060
Wait, I was choking on a chips.

23:42.559 --> 23:44.602
and I do not give a royal crab.

23:45.309 --> 23:46.893
Welcome to Nova Scotia.

23:49.101 --> 23:53.102
And when you speak with your uncle,
tell him Tom sends him regards.

24:10.434 --> 24:11.434
Oh my God, that cold!

24:27.601 --> 24:28.643
Excuse me.

24:30.101 --> 24:35.393
Sorry, the front door was open.
I hope you do not mind.

24:36.559 --> 24:38.268
We'll just be waiting
in the sitting room.

24:49.851 --> 24:51.227
What do you all doing here?

24:51.934 --> 24:53.768
The Ad you place?
The healer?

25:03.267 --> 25:05.102
- Oh, Give me a minute.
- Alright.

25:15.184 --> 25:17.643
Right, who's first?

25:17.726 --> 25:18.768
We are.

25:19.101 --> 25:20.643
Great. How can I help?

25:20.726 --> 25:24.227
Well, I have arthritis
and it's getting worse each day.

25:24.309 --> 25:27.643
And my husband,
well his hearing is practically shut.

25:28.017 --> 25:29.435
So annoying.

25:30.726 --> 25:32.643
So, can you help us?

25:33.101 --> 25:36.935
S-Sorry,
It seem to be a bit a mistake here.

25:37.017 --> 25:39.727
But you a healer?
Says so in the ad.

25:41.267 --> 25:46.643
No no no...
It's... It's my commercial phase.

25:46.851 --> 25:49.185
It's... It's my slogan.

25:50.476 --> 25:53.727
- I fix electrical things.
- Ad says you heal.

25:59.809 --> 26:02.060
"The Healer, Alec Bailey,
Arrives in Lunenburg."

26:02.142 --> 26:07.018
"I fix anyone."
Wait... I did not say that.

26:07.101 --> 26:08.852
Well, it's printed right there.

26:08.934 --> 26:11.393
Frankly, we were a bit surprised...

26:11.476 --> 26:16.727
that you would bring it up this way,
being that it supposed to be a secret.

26:17.351 --> 26:20.018
What do you mean a secret?

26:20.101 --> 26:22.352
So my blood sugar is off the chart.

26:22.434 --> 26:24.602
Doctors say I'm gonna
need insulin at this point.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.727
I'm so sick of dieting.
It does nothing.

26:26.809 --> 26:29.060
Yeah, I'm like a factory kidney stone.

26:29.142 --> 26:30.810
One a month, sometimes two...

26:31.226 --> 26:33.060
I can feel one coming as of yesterday.

26:34.059 --> 26:36.518
The ad is wrong.

26:36.601 --> 26:38.852
I can't... I'm not a healer.
I don't cure people.

26:38.934 --> 26:40.560
He doesn’t want to help us.

26:40.642 --> 26:43.310
- What?
- He doesn’t want to help us!

26:43.392 --> 26:45.977
- Why not?
- Because I'm not a doctor.

26:46.059 --> 26:48.893
- What?
- So, you're not the chosen one?

26:49.434 --> 26:50.810
What are you talking about?

26:50.976 --> 26:52.810
Why would you lied
like that then?

26:52.892 --> 26:55.727
Look, It's a mistake, okay, a misprint.

26:56.267 --> 26:57.955
If you have anything
electrical, anything at all.

26:57.990 --> 26:59.643
I'll be happy to look at it.

26:59.726 --> 27:00.977
That's what I do.

27:02.059 --> 27:03.435
My truck broken down.

27:03.517 --> 27:06.393
If someone could drive me to Cecilia's,
I could clear all this up.

27:06.476 --> 27:08.316
Didn’t you say you fix
electrical things?

27:08.517 --> 27:10.393
- Yeah
- Fix your car.

27:11.226 --> 27:12.602
So unfair.

27:13.017 --> 27:15.268
I really thought my
prayers had been answer.

27:17.392 --> 27:21.393
I can take you to Cecilia's,
if you do something for me.

27:22.976 --> 27:23.810
Sure.

27:23.892 --> 27:27.143
My boyfriend has been procrastinating
about asking to marry me.

27:27.267 --> 27:28.727
Just need a little push.

27:29.226 --> 27:31.705
So, if I say something that
does not make much sense...

27:31.740 --> 27:34.185
when his around,
you just follow my lead?

27:34.392 --> 27:36.643
Yeah, I can do that.
When you want me to do that?

27:36.726 --> 27:38.643
Now.
He's the one who brought me here.

27:42.934 --> 27:44.602
So, Philip, this is Alec.

27:45.184 --> 27:48.352
We know way back.
How long it has been, Alec?

27:49.517 --> 27:53.018
- A While.
- Gosh, does not feel that way.

27:53.142 --> 27:54.935
It's amazing how for a woman,

27:55.017 --> 27:58.227
first impression with
a man a just so important.

27:59.392 --> 28:01.852
I was lucky,
you were so sweet, Alec.

28:01.934 --> 28:03.185
So gentle,

28:04.351 --> 28:07.102
How long are you staying?

28:07.517 --> 28:09.727
- A year.
- A whole year?

28:09.809 --> 28:11.060
That is so great.

28:16.017 --> 28:19.143
One day we should go swimming,
at the lake, like we used to.

28:19.684 --> 28:22.435
Remember that time my
mom nearly caught us butt naked?

28:22.517 --> 28:26.435
- we hide for whole hour behind a rock?
- No, I don't remember that.

28:26.517 --> 28:29.185
It's fine, Alec, Philip understands.

28:29.267 --> 28:32.102
We all have a past,
Right, honey?

28:33.767 --> 28:36.102
Sure.

28:51.517 --> 28:54.518
See you soon, Alec.
So happy you're here.

28:54.601 --> 28:56.018
Call me anytime.

28:56.101 --> 28:57.602
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:00.309 --> 29:01.309
What?

29:03.476 --> 29:04.477
Nothing.

29:05.517 --> 29:06.893
They misprinted the ad!

29:09.351 --> 29:10.602
Hey, this isn’t funny.

29:11.184 --> 29:13.393
I already had four
potential clients in my house:

29:13.476 --> 29:17.185
One with arthritis, one
deaf, some nachos waitress...

29:17.267 --> 29:18.768
and some dude running on kidney stone...

29:18.851 --> 29:20.785
I am sorry. I'll have
them to re-print it,

29:20.809 --> 29:22.243
but it won't out
until next week.

29:22.267 --> 29:23.393
I've been here only two days...

29:23.476 --> 29:27.435
I got ticket yesterday for 250
dollar by this policemen.

29:27.517 --> 29:28.014
Wait, Tom?

29:28.049 --> 29:29.643
Tom pulled you over?

29:30.851 --> 29:33.393
Tom's ex-wife had a crush on Raymond...

29:33.476 --> 29:35.393
and rumors said that they had a things...

29:35.476 --> 29:39.018
So, Tom tries to make your uncle's
life impossible when he's here.

29:39.101 --> 29:41.852
Great.
Well then now I'm the target, aren't I?

29:49.517 --> 29:51.935
What is it with you and the animals?

29:52.017 --> 29:55.143
My dog love you,
the sheep follow us...

29:55.226 --> 29:57.435
I think you got some
strange animals.

29:58.226 --> 29:59.393
I wanted to ask you.

30:00.642 --> 30:02.538
I know it's cheeky,
but the other day...

30:02.573 --> 30:04.435
Were you serious about
the job offer?

30:04.767 --> 30:08.685
- Yeah! Of course!
- Great! When do I start?

30:10.142 --> 30:12.393
Right now! I can't believe it.

30:12.726 --> 30:14.310
- What was that?
- Just follow me!

30:21.351 --> 30:22.518
Oh my God!

30:22.684 --> 30:24.393
What?

30:24.892 --> 30:27.935
This cow has been difficulties since
yesterday, in constant pain.

30:28.017 --> 30:29.268
What's wrong her?

30:29.351 --> 30:30.435
She's pregnant

30:30.976 --> 30:34.435
Do you think she's gonna lose...
The baby?

30:34.517 --> 30:36.560
No.
I think it's about to happen right now.

30:37.684 --> 30:39.768
- Are you going to giving birth?
- Yes

30:39.851 --> 30:42.310
I think I should probably just
give it some privacy.

30:42.392 --> 30:43.893
Alec, grab the gloves.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.810
Do you want a job or not?
Grab the gloves!

30:47.184 --> 30:48.435
Alec, come on!

30:51.642 --> 30:52.685
Easy bro.

30:53.267 --> 30:56.268
Oh my God! What are those sticks
coming out of her tunnel?

30:56.351 --> 30:57.560
The legs!

30:57.642 --> 31:00.768
Okay, we gonna pull, ready?
Ready?

31:01.851 --> 31:02.852
Go!

31:04.767 --> 31:07.643
Come on, come on, come on!

31:09.767 --> 31:10.810
Come on.

31:15.267 --> 31:16.477
Hey, little one

31:26.517 --> 31:29.643
You know, it's not usually
like that, it's actually...

31:29.726 --> 31:31.518
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Okay.

31:34.434 --> 31:36.685
I still hate that she was staring at me.

32:18.559 --> 32:22.893

He isn’t some kind of a healer.

32:23.392 --> 32:24.768
You not the healer?

32:24.851 --> 32:27.977
No, I fix electrical things,

Can you at least try?

32:32.017 --> 32:34.227

33:26.642 --> 33:27.977
I want a word with you.

33:28.059 --> 33:29.695
How dare you come to
this peaceful community?

33:29.719 --> 33:31.368
and try to scams this people?

33:31.392 --> 33:33.060
- What the hell you talking about?
- A healer?

33:33.142 --> 33:35.060
Is that the best ploy you
can come up with?

33:35.142 --> 33:37.727
Look... It was a mistake, alright,
they misprinted the ad.

33:37.809 --> 33:40.227

33:40.517 --> 33:42.393
Now you got the whole town

33:42.476 --> 33:44.280
Of course you says it is a mistake.

33:44.315 --> 33:45.852
What the hell you talking about,
I'm telling you that the ad is bullshit.

33:45.934 --> 33:48.185

33:48.267 --> 33:49.788
Well then, listen to me and

Paula, come on...

33:53.476 --> 33:54.477
Okay, go.

forest a thick with mosses,

33:57.809 --> 33:59.143
So moist of the spring...

34:01.809 --> 34:03.310
Sounds like a bad argument.

34:03.392 --> 34:05.205
And propagate your publicity?
No sir,

34:05.240 --> 34:07.018
I'm gonna report you
to the authorities!

34:07.101 --> 34:09.185
You know what? Get off my property!
You give me a headache

34:09.266 --> 34:10.677
Your uncle would be ashamed of you.

34:10.697 --> 34:12.226
Don't you walk away from me!
I'm talking to you!

34:12.309 --> 34:13.560

34:39.141 --> 34:42.560
Oh my God, he murdered Father Malloy.

34:50.309 --> 34:53.393

34:56.601 --> 34:57.768

34:57.851 --> 34:59.893
- Let's get out of here.
- No, wait, wait.

35:07.767 --> 35:09.310
Oh my Gosh!

35:09.392 --> 35:11.685

36:40.559 --> 36:45.185
Hey, Alec, I didn’t know you were the
Healer. I just saw the ad.

36:45.559 --> 36:48.518
Where is the newspaper office?
I need to talk to them!

36:49.101 --> 36:51.060
And would you like the spacial juice of today?

36:51.142 --> 36:52.643

36:53.184 --> 36:57.227
Larry! Would you like to try the juice

36:57.309 --> 36:59.185
Why are you screaming at me?

36:59.809 --> 37:01.060

37:02.726 --> 37:06.185
- Larry, can you hear me?
- Yeah, what is it?

37:06.434 --> 37:10.310
- Larry, you got your hearing back!
- I think I have.

37:10.392 --> 37:12.352
And I didn’t have any
pain this morning.

37:12.434 --> 37:14.977
- I thought it was just a lucky break.
- Dear Jesus!

37:15.059 --> 37:17.560
They say Leslie daughter
is like a chatterbox

37:17.642 --> 37:19.060
after they saw Alec.

37:19.517 --> 37:22.227
I'm going to take my blood tested,
Maybe I'm better too.

37:22.309 --> 37:23.309
Yeah, you should.

37:23.434 --> 37:26.643
- You'll really think that he's the one?
- He must be the one.

37:26.851 --> 37:28.310
Would you like some coffee, honey?

37:29.017 --> 37:30.518
No, no thanks.

37:33.601 --> 37:35.602
Hey, guys! Look, that's him!

37:35.934 --> 37:37.352
Lets go.

37:38.184 --> 37:40.810
- Yeah, he's there.
- Where is he?

37:41.184 --> 37:42.602
We printed what we were told.

37:42.684 --> 37:45.810
Bullshit! Now I need put clear
messages for tomorrow...

37:45.892 --> 37:47.352

37:47.434 --> 37:49.432

37:49.467 --> 37:51.893
I do not care!
Just make an exception!

37:52.517 --> 37:53.518
This, this whole thing...

37:53.601 --> 37:56.727
Oh my dear man, thank you
so very much!

37:56.851 --> 37:57.768
I can hear!

37:57.851 --> 37:59.435
I never should've doubted you.

38:01.226 --> 38:03.477
I hadn’t have any pain since yesterday.

38:03.559 --> 38:07.227
And Rebecca doing so well,
you are a blessing to this town!

38:07.517 --> 38:09.852
Has my blood sugar corrected it self?

38:09.934 --> 38:11.102
I don't buy this crap!

38:11.184 --> 38:14.143
There are no Healers and
this guy has no powers.

38:14.226 --> 38:16.727
- This is ridiculous, Mary.
- Thank you! Thank you.

38:16.809 --> 38:19.268
Finally someone with common sense here!

38:19.351 --> 38:21.185
Oh, my God, Phillip!

38:21.267 --> 38:23.227

38:23.309 --> 38:25.685
My stutter...
My stuttering is gone!

38:29.684 --> 38:31.727

How much are you charging?

38:36.767 --> 38:38.310
How much do we owe you?

38:38.476 --> 38:39.477
Nothing!

38:40.184 --> 38:41.185
Nothing!

38:43.642 --> 38:44.852
Do you know why?

38:45.726 --> 38:47.643
Because real Healers don't exist!

38:47.767 --> 38:50.268
Next week his going to

38:50.351 --> 38:52.185

38:53.434 --> 38:55.268

39:09.601 --> 39:13.060

You're almost two hours late!

39:13.142 --> 39:14.955
I got a great excuse, okay?

39:14.990 --> 39:16.768
Do you still want me to
work with you or not?

39:17.267 --> 39:18.935
- Yeah, sure!
- Great!

39:19.726 --> 39:21.643
Who's giving birth today? Anyone?

39:21.726 --> 39:23.977
I know that you had some bad luck
since you got here.

39:24.059 --> 39:26.852
Bad luck?
This place is a living nightmare,

39:26.934 --> 39:30.852
the people here are crazy and I got this
constant blistering headache and...

39:33.142 --> 39:34.143
What?

39:34.767 --> 39:36.018
It's my birthday.

39:37.851 --> 39:39.643

39:41.184 --> 39:42.643
Do you like Pinot Noir?

39:45.517 --> 39:47.227

39:47.767 --> 39:49.852
Ohh, you finally notice.

39:49.934 --> 39:51.560

Thank you for this.

39:55.934 --> 39:57.643
Happy birthday, Alec.

39:58.267 --> 40:00.143
So, do you have a girlfriend?

40:03.809 --> 40:05.935
- No, not at the moment.
- No?

40:06.017 --> 40:07.685
What if you were wrong about all of this?

40:07.767 --> 40:12.727
I was thinking, I bet if we
did an experiment...

40:12.809 --> 40:16.518
you and I...
I like kiss you...

40:16.892 --> 40:19.310
Maybe you might changed your mind.
You don't think?

40:19.392 --> 40:22.435
Interesting, I think we should do...

40:22.517 --> 40:23.993
- an experiment before...
- Okay.

40:24.017 --> 40:29.643
Where maybe you kiss Fred and
see if you change your mind.

40:31.809 --> 40:33.143
I'm really that bad?

40:33.226 --> 40:34.227
Yes!

40:35.642 --> 40:37.185
- You know what is weird?
- What

40:38.142 --> 40:40.108
Rebecca, that couple child,

40:40.143 --> 40:42.768
She started talking
after after she met you.

40:43.684 --> 40:45.185
From what I've heard, you're having...

40:45.267 --> 40:47.393
- some sort effect to people.
- No...

40:48.517 --> 40:52.643
It just people in this town, they just
looking for an excuse to wake up...

40:52.726 --> 40:57.018
from there boring existence and find
miracles where there are none.

40:57.101 --> 40:59.101
That little girl was about to
speak, I know it.

40:59.184 --> 41:02.518
Alec Bailey, we have you surrounded.

41:02.642 --> 41:06.477
get down on your knees with your hands
behind your head...

41:06.559 --> 41:08.435
Tom? Is that you?

41:08.517 --> 41:11.893
Cecilia! Cecilia, get away from him!
he's dangerous!

41:11.976 --> 41:16.102
Alec, Alec! Get down on your knees
with your hands behind your head!

41:16.351 --> 41:18.435
I won't tell you again!
Get on your knees!

41:18.517 --> 41:20.393
Look, it's ticket! I'm gonna pay it...

41:21.809 --> 41:23.185
- Are you insane?
- Oh my God...

41:23.267 --> 41:25.018
I thought the safety on.

41:25.434 --> 41:28.518
Are you out of your mind?
What are you doing?

41:28.601 --> 41:32.143
Alec Bailey, you're under arrest
for the murder of Father Malloy.

41:32.226 --> 41:33.535
- What?
- Anything that you say...

41:33.559 --> 41:34.993
will be held against you
in a court of law.

41:35.017 --> 41:36.893
- What?
- I didn’t killed anybody.

41:36.976 --> 41:38.810
He have heart attack and
I left him in the church.

41:38.934 --> 41:40.768
You are one cynical bastard.

41:40.851 --> 41:43.143
We have the whole thing
on video tape, Cecilia.

41:43.226 --> 41:45.393
He killed him and now he probably
buried him somewhere.

41:45.476 --> 41:47.247
He walked on his own two feet
in to the church!

41:47.282 --> 41:49.018
His gotta be somewhere, Tom!

41:49.101 --> 41:51.602
We have an eye witnesses,
we have video footage...

41:51.684 --> 41:53.560
of him pounding on the poor man.

41:53.642 --> 41:55.935
- Where is the body?
- There is no body!

41:56.017 --> 41:57.560
He's out there, just go and find him!

41:57.642 --> 42:00.227
Father Malloy is nowhere to be found.
Are you that stupid.

42:00.309 --> 42:02.477
Even his car is still
at your property!

42:02.684 --> 42:04.352
Cecilia, I didn’t do anything!

42:04.767 --> 42:07.602
Find Father Malloy, Cecilia!
I'm innocent!

42:12.559 --> 42:14.643
Now, what do we got here?

42:15.267 --> 42:16.352
What is that?

42:17.976 --> 42:21.602
- It's shovel...
- What's he doing?

42:21.934 --> 42:22.643
Listen up.

42:22.726 --> 42:24.227
<i>He's probably gonna bury him.</i>

42:24.809 --> 42:30.018
And you tell me at the end of it if you
think that Father Malloy is still alive.

42:33.517 --> 42:35.977
<i>I've got it on camera
Let's go see Tom!</i>

42:39.642 --> 42:42.810
- Wow.
- Thanks.

42:42.892 --> 42:43.892
No, not...

42:44.892 --> 42:48.018
There has to be some
sort of logical explanation.

42:48.101 --> 42:50.581
- The man is not an assassins...
- Then where is the priest?

42:50.892 --> 42:53.243
He took the body, put it in
the back of his truck...

42:53.267 --> 42:54.518
and he took it somewhere.

42:54.601 --> 42:58.102
I mean,
this man is a sick, cruel bastard

42:58.184 --> 43:00.727
and you are just lucky
that he didn’t hurt you too.

43:00.809 --> 43:01.935
What gonna happen to him?

43:02.267 --> 43:04.935
NSPD is coming down to picking
him up in the morning.

43:05.226 --> 43:07.518
- This is major.
- Let me talk to him.

43:08.351 --> 43:11.685
Please, Tom.
Please, let me talk to him.

43:12.726 --> 43:15.768
Five minutes
and don't you dare get close.

43:20.934 --> 43:21.934
Five.

43:26.726 --> 43:29.435
- Did you find him?
- No. I look for him everywhere.

43:29.517 --> 43:30.893
Fred's looking too.

43:34.059 --> 43:35.518
What's gonna happen to me?

43:35.642 --> 43:38.185
They're taking you to a Halifax prison.

43:38.559 --> 43:42.185
- Did you speak to a lawyer?
- No! I don't want a lawyer.

43:42.267 --> 43:44.935
- This is serious, Alec.
- I didn’t anything.

43:45.017 --> 43:46.822
He had a heart
attack at my house,

43:46.857 --> 43:48.310
I managed to get him in truck,

43:48.392 --> 43:52.643
I drove him to the town
and then he woke up,

43:52.767 --> 43:54.810
and he walk into the church.

43:56.392 --> 43:57.435
What?

43:57.517 --> 44:01.268
I just watched the video
Father Malloy looks very dead.

44:01.351 --> 44:03.977
Yeah, tell me about it,
he freak me out. I thought...

44:07.642 --> 44:08.810
You don't believe me, do you?

44:08.892 --> 44:12.227
I do, it's just so implausible,
what he would just get up...

44:12.309 --> 44:14.893
- and walked away after all...
- Yes, he did.

44:15.976 --> 44:18.310
I believe you, Alec. I'm just trying...

44:19.934 --> 44:20.934
Just get out.

44:23.226 --> 44:24.226
What?

44:28.767 --> 44:30.727
I will find Father Malloy.

44:31.309 --> 44:32.560
You want a shovel?

44:36.976 --> 44:42.143
So, you want to use the bathroom,
before I lockup for tonight.

44:42.642 --> 44:43.642
Yes.

44:57.351 --> 45:01.560
Father Malloy was my
very good friend.

45:28.851 --> 45:29.851
They're here!

45:37.684 --> 45:38.684
Tom.

45:38.726 --> 45:39.852
Hey, Pete!

45:39.976 --> 45:42.310
- How you doin?
- Good, good, you?

45:42.392 --> 45:43.185
Good, good, good.

45:43.267 --> 45:46.268
Who would've thought you have any of this
going on like this in Lunenburg, huh?

45:49.726 --> 45:51.227
The guy is from Britain, isn’t he?

45:51.476 --> 45:55.018
Yeah. He's just arrived, he's only
here for less than a week.

45:58.226 --> 46:00.685
We haven’t yet found out
where he has buried the body.

46:01.934 --> 46:03.602
We'll find the body.

46:03.726 --> 46:04.935
We have Al Capone here.

46:05.017 --> 46:06.602
He is the best dog, I've got.

46:06.684 --> 46:09.977
Let me tell you this boy will
sniff of things only dog dream of...

46:10.976 --> 46:12.227
- Hey, am I free to go?
- Freeze!

46:13.142 --> 46:14.502
Hands on your head now!

46:14.976 --> 46:16.768
- Or I'll spray out of the shit you boy.
- Okay!

46:17.184 --> 46:18.643
How did you get free and
get out of here?

46:18.726 --> 46:20.368
The door was open and my
cuffs were loose...

46:20.392 --> 46:24.518
- Bullshit!
- Henry, let Al Capone go, get'em boy.

46:24.851 --> 46:26.060
Get'em boy.

46:27.976 --> 46:29.018
Get'em boy.

46:31.267 --> 46:32.560
Lunenburg police.

46:32.642 --> 46:33.768
Henry, Grab the dog.

46:36.226 --> 46:38.602
- Tom...
- Damn it, not now, Jim.

46:38.684 --> 46:40.195
I need you
to get down on the ground slowly!

46:40.219 --> 46:41.743
Or I will put a bullet
through your head!

46:41.767 --> 46:43.852
Tom, I'm sorry, but it's Father
Malloy on the phone for you!

46:45.017 --> 46:46.185
I told you!

46:46.267 --> 46:48.268
Shut up and don't move!

46:53.351 --> 46:54.435
Who is this?

46:58.101 --> 47:01.352
But we saw video where you...

47:02.351 --> 47:04.352
- Right...
- What the hell have you done, Tom?

47:04.434 --> 47:05.477
Thank you.

47:09.267 --> 47:10.685
He is innocent.

47:11.517 --> 47:12.727
Oh my God!

47:13.059 --> 47:16.810
That was Father Malloy calling
to confirm it, and he's fine.

47:18.809 --> 47:22.935
What the hell is wrong with all of you?
I told you I was innocent!

47:29.142 --> 47:32.560
What the hell have you done now, Tom?

47:32.767 --> 47:33.893
You saw the video..

47:33.976 --> 47:36.852
I mean there was no way
he was still alive...

47:37.101 --> 47:42.518
We all saw the video, Tom.
What are you? Steven Spielberg now?

47:42.601 --> 47:45.893
There is more footage. Look!

47:45.976 --> 47:47.643
- Watch this!
- Let's go, Henry.

47:48.059 --> 47:48.768
Pete!

47:48.851 --> 47:50.977
Don't waste my time again, Tom.

47:57.517 --> 48:02.518
You... what a coffee with those
little cookie you like?

48:04.642 --> 48:05.642
Shut up.

48:13.642 --> 48:14.768
Father Malloy!

48:16.892 --> 48:18.102
Where the hell were you?

48:18.184 --> 48:20.285
They put me in jail
thinking you were dead!

48:20.309 --> 48:22.810
I know I'm sorry.
I came as soon as I heard.

48:22.892 --> 48:24.892
Well you come soon enough, did you?

48:25.226 --> 48:28.102
I'm sorry for not believing in you.

48:29.642 --> 48:31.143
- Wait!
- What?

48:32.392 --> 48:34.102
I have a confession to make.

48:34.976 --> 48:36.977
I lost my faith about two years ago.

48:38.601 --> 48:42.060
I actually stopped believing
that God could existed.

48:42.267 --> 48:46.310
Wait.
you accuse me of lying to these people?

48:47.809 --> 48:50.185
I didn’t have a heart
to tell the community,

48:50.267 --> 48:54.102
so I just kept playing my role,

48:54.726 --> 48:57.060
which is... what I was, the priest.

48:59.434 --> 49:00.518
That's pathetic.

49:01.184 --> 49:03.102
But I died yesterday.

49:04.642 --> 49:05.727
I'm sure of it.

49:06.809 --> 49:09.435
And nothing should've brought me back,
and yet...

49:12.684 --> 49:14.602
Look, when moved to Lunenberg,

49:14.726 --> 49:19.518
I heard stories, rumors, Healers.

49:19.601 --> 49:23.977
I just dismissed it as,
non-sensual myths.

49:25.976 --> 49:30.477
- Wait, wait..
- I believe, you have a gift.

49:31.142 --> 49:33.538
A God given gift,
which brought me back...

49:33.573 --> 49:35.935
and gave me a second chance.

49:37.517 --> 49:39.018
Are you serious...

49:40.059 --> 49:41.602
I got my faith back.

49:42.767 --> 49:44.518
I want to thank you for that.

49:45.976 --> 49:50.852
Alec, son, there is no
deny it, you're a healer.

49:53.934 --> 49:55.143
And I'm done.

49:55.559 --> 49:57.268
I am done.

49:57.684 --> 49:58.727
You are...

49:59.517 --> 50:01.852
Your all clinically insane here.

50:27.976 --> 50:30.393
"There's a room you haven't
seen yet: The basement."

50:30.559 --> 50:32.185
"This is the key to the house."

51:03.976 --> 51:06.643
"One is sorrow, two is joy,

51:07.059 --> 51:09.852
three for a girl, four for a boy,

51:10.101 --> 51:12.477
five for silver, six for gold,

51:12.934 --> 51:15.685
seven for a secret, never to be told.

51:17.101 --> 51:18.727
Is this the key to the house?

52:44.059 --> 52:45.852
It's your destiny.

52:48.392 --> 52:49.477
Hello, Alec.

52:49.601 --> 52:50.643
It's you.

52:51.226 --> 52:52.727
We need to talk.

52:53.142 --> 52:55.393
- There's a lot to take in.
- What the hell is going on here?

52:55.476 --> 52:57.493
- Why you have my name on wall?
- Calm down.

52:57.517 --> 53:00.477
Don't tell me to calm down.
What is this place?

53:00.559 --> 53:01.810
Who is this people?

53:03.267 --> 53:05.560
These are your ancestors.

53:07.101 --> 53:11.518
That one, behind you, was the last
one chosen, it was my father.

53:12.059 --> 53:13.935
Is this some kind of religious sect?

53:14.267 --> 53:17.352
You have the family gift,
the gift of healing.

53:18.017 --> 53:22.643
- It skip a generation.
- Oh my God, you all insane!

53:22.726 --> 53:26.143
Alec, since you been here,
you've helped a young girl...

53:26.226 --> 53:28.935
find her speech,
an old man his hearing...

53:29.017 --> 53:32.477
- It wasn’t me.
- Father Malloy died and his back.

53:33.101 --> 53:36.310
- I've seen the video.
- I didn’t do anything.

53:36.392 --> 53:39.768
- I don't even touched those people.
- You don't have to touch them.

53:40.809 --> 53:44.893
If you're nearby and someone is
meant to be cured, then they will be.

53:46.934 --> 53:50.393
- Like it or not, you've been chosen.
- Who chose me?

53:50.476 --> 53:51.935
Whatever you want to call it.

53:52.601 --> 53:55.727
The Big Chief, Mr. Creator,
the Supreme Being...

53:55.809 --> 53:56.809
God?

53:57.142 --> 54:00.102
- Well, that's the more popular name.
- I don't believe in God.

54:00.559 --> 54:02.143
Pick another name.

54:05.767 --> 54:08.393
The headaches are part of it,
they will go away.

54:08.476 --> 54:11.227
Why do not we go outside
to get some air?

54:11.309 --> 54:13.935
- Alec!
- No, no, stay away from me.

54:14.392 --> 54:16.143
Welcome to the family, Alec.

54:56.476 --> 54:58.768
- Are you okay?
- Yeah...

55:04.059 --> 55:05.643
I had a nightmare.

55:09.184 --> 55:10.185
Wait...

55:16.976 --> 55:19.477
- What's going on?
- It was not a dream.

55:19.809 --> 55:21.977
Everything Raymond told you is true.

55:22.059 --> 55:23.643
You knew about all this?

55:23.726 --> 55:25.227
Throughout all the Healers,

55:25.309 --> 55:28.935
Cecilia's family has always been among
the few, who knew.

55:29.309 --> 55:31.560
Our two families are connected.

55:32.476 --> 55:34.893
- Why me?
- I thought it was worth a shot,

55:34.976 --> 55:37.810
and if it wasn’t you, at least
I would've helped you.

55:37.892 --> 55:40.060
Helped me?
You gave me two days!

55:40.142 --> 55:42.977
The gift can only be activated...

55:43.559 --> 55:45.518
when the chosen one is here.

55:46.351 --> 55:48.352
And on his 30th birthday.

55:49.726 --> 55:51.227
I just turned 30.

55:51.642 --> 55:54.393
Alec, have you recently noticed...

55:54.476 --> 55:56.852
that animals are
fascinated with you?

55:57.184 --> 56:00.227
This morning, when you were detained,
how did you get out?

56:01.017 --> 56:05.560
The handcuffs were loose...
The door just opened...

56:06.101 --> 56:07.976
It's written:
"The Healer will not be...

56:08.011 --> 56:09.852
bound by any man, he will be free."

56:09.934 --> 56:11.489
But we made-up the name...

56:11.524 --> 56:13.643
for the shop in
London, "The Healer".

56:14.434 --> 56:16.393
Yes. That was a bit strange,

56:16.851 --> 56:19.310
but possibly more then a coincidence.

56:19.392 --> 56:22.310
Oh, and then the ad in the paper?
Was that also a coincidence?

56:22.392 --> 56:25.977
- No. I misprinted that on purpose.
- Why would you do that?

56:26.059 --> 56:28.643
I did what I had to do, Alec.

56:30.434 --> 56:32.268
Do I have a choice in any of this?

56:32.892 --> 56:35.185
Yes. Yes, you do.

56:36.017 --> 56:39.560
Tonight, the day after your
birthday, you must decide.

56:40.642 --> 56:43.393
unless you reject the gift
before midnight...

56:43.726 --> 56:45.185
it's a bounty of your life.

56:45.267 --> 56:46.393
Well, I don't want it.

56:46.726 --> 56:48.977
Alec, you could help so many people...

56:49.059 --> 56:50.976
I don't want anything to do with this!

56:51.011 --> 56:52.893
Alec, listen, this is what
we are gonna do.

56:52.976 --> 56:57.102
We'll leave you to think about it.
You got about six hours.

56:58.267 --> 57:00.060
We'll be back before midnight.

57:02.267 --> 57:03.518
And then what?

57:03.601 --> 57:06.477
Sacrifice a goat and bathe me
in his blood, is that right?

57:07.476 --> 57:08.852
That's always an option.

57:09.476 --> 57:10.477
No, Alec.

57:10.559 --> 57:13.435
Midnight will come and,
if you decide to accept,

57:13.517 --> 57:16.060
We'll open a good bottle
of wine to celebrate.

57:27.309 --> 57:28.602
What do you think?

57:29.226 --> 57:31.268
I think it went quite well.

57:55.601 --> 57:56.685
It's nearly midnight.

58:01.267 --> 58:02.268
I don't want it.

58:04.517 --> 58:05.935
I don't chose any of this.

58:07.684 --> 58:10.435
Alec, I think you're making a mistake.

58:10.892 --> 58:12.477
Well that's my final answer.

58:12.767 --> 58:15.643
You know what?
Charlie, would wanted it.

58:15.726 --> 58:18.227
- Don't you dare talk about my brother.
- Why not?

58:18.351 --> 58:21.935
It's a truth,
he should've been the next Healer.

58:23.851 --> 58:25.685
He had a sense of responsibility.

58:25.767 --> 58:29.060
Responsibility?
He don't even know you existed!

58:30.351 --> 58:33.435
And where were you when
my mother died? Huh?

58:34.101 --> 58:35.602
I love my sister.

58:37.059 --> 58:40.018
- I just couldn't show myself...
- That's bullshit!

58:40.476 --> 58:43.018
We keep it secret until
a time is right.

58:43.101 --> 58:43.926
That's the way it works.

58:43.926 --> 58:45.852
Well, this is the way
it's works on my end.

58:45.934 --> 58:48.352
I'm not gonna play
Harry Potter for you both.

58:49.642 --> 58:50.852
So what happens now?

58:52.017 --> 58:54.560
I go back to London and you
don't pay my debts, right?

58:54.767 --> 58:56.685
No, I'm a man of my word,

58:57.517 --> 59:00.727
but you do have to remain here
for a full year.

59:01.642 --> 59:03.977
You do realize that you can't
take this back.

59:04.059 --> 59:06.060
Please, I don't want it.

59:11.101 --> 59:12.143
Midnight...

59:18.809 --> 59:21.102
I need you to go in to town.

59:21.892 --> 59:23.018
Now?

59:23.226 --> 59:25.602
Yes, everyone is gathered in the church.

59:25.684 --> 59:28.310
- They're waiting for you.
- It's tradition.

59:29.184 --> 59:32.352
- They think I will accepted the gift?
- They wanted you to.

59:35.726 --> 59:37.102
This never ends, doesn't?

59:37.184 --> 59:39.935
It will,
after you told them your decision.

59:40.642 --> 59:43.018
Fine, I'll go.

59:43.101 --> 59:44.435
I go with you.

59:44.767 --> 59:46.435
It'll be easier.

59:56.142 --> 59:58.893
Wait wait.
Is this really necessary?

59:58.976 --> 01:00:02.518
They all waiting,
everyone, children too.

01:00:02.601 --> 01:00:04.143
They gonna hate me.

01:00:05.309 --> 01:00:06.768
Why can't you just tell them?

01:00:06.851 --> 01:00:09.185
It's a least that you could do,
don't you think?

01:00:41.059 --> 01:00:42.310
Hello everyone.

01:00:44.434 --> 01:00:46.705
I know that it's late,
but Alec has been kind enough...

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:48.977
to come and talk to us.

01:00:59.976 --> 01:01:01.768
Look, I'm sorry to say that...

01:01:04.142 --> 01:01:05.935
I won't be your healer.

01:01:11.142 --> 01:01:13.393
This whole thing has been so...

01:01:14.101 --> 01:01:17.893
so strange and unexpected.

01:01:19.017 --> 01:01:20.893
I just couldn't handle it, so...

01:01:23.392 --> 01:01:25.643
I hope you'll understand and...

01:01:26.934 --> 01:01:29.560
I'll be gone by next spring, so...

01:01:35.851 --> 01:01:37.810
We must respect Alec's decision.

01:01:39.351 --> 01:01:40.810
This wasn't for him.

01:01:41.642 --> 01:01:43.493
Also we must be grateful for the gifts...

01:01:43.517 --> 01:01:45.357
he did give us for the
past couple of days.

01:01:45.726 --> 01:01:46.977
I know, I am.

01:01:47.851 --> 01:01:50.227
Thank you, Alec, for our Rebecca.

01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:53.185
She talks so much,
I want shut her up.

01:01:55.934 --> 01:01:57.997
And I forgotten how annoying...

01:01:58.032 --> 01:02:00.060
my wife's voices when
she's yelling at me.

01:02:02.809 --> 01:02:04.577
Just got my test back...

01:02:04.601 --> 01:02:06.852
sugar back to normal.
Thank you, Alec.

01:02:08.851 --> 01:02:10.852
First time peeing without
praying the Rosary.

01:02:12.642 --> 01:02:13.642
Thanks man.

01:02:19.559 --> 01:02:22.227
I lost stutter.
I can't thank you enough.

01:02:23.101 --> 01:02:26.352
Would like to show it off by,
sharing with you'll...

01:02:27.392 --> 01:02:31.018
loud and clear, that
Mary and I are engaged.

01:02:42.101 --> 01:02:44.352
Okay, okay, settle down.

01:02:45.059 --> 01:02:46.059
Settle down.

01:02:46.351 --> 01:02:48.643
Alec, you're part of this community,

01:02:48.934 --> 01:02:51.935
and we cherish you stay here
regardless of your decision.

01:02:52.476 --> 01:02:53.477
Thank you.

01:02:54.892 --> 01:02:55.892
Girls...

01:03:03.267 --> 01:03:06.560
- This is from all of us.
- Sorry we got you in trouble.

01:03:06.851 --> 01:03:09.018
Sort of late,
but happy birthday.

01:03:09.101 --> 01:03:11.477
Happy birthday, Alec!

01:03:14.142 --> 01:03:15.142
Thank you.

01:03:17.601 --> 01:03:18.601
Thank you.

01:04:10.726 --> 01:04:11.768
Mr. Bailey?

01:04:13.392 --> 01:04:14.392
Yes.

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:16.852
We came because our
daughter is very sick.

01:04:19.226 --> 01:04:21.643
Look, I cleared all this up
yesterday at the meeting.

01:04:21.726 --> 01:04:25.268
We are not from here.
We driven from far away to see you.

01:04:25.351 --> 01:04:26.768
I can't help your daughter.

01:04:27.559 --> 01:04:31.060
She has cancer.
Doctors said there is no cure.

01:04:32.767 --> 01:04:34.977
I'm sorry that your daughter so sick.

01:04:35.059 --> 01:04:38.560
Please, could you just come out
and take a look?

01:04:40.101 --> 01:04:43.643
I'm gonna ask you politely
to please leave my property.

01:04:43.726 --> 01:04:45.602
I've been harassed enough as it is.

01:04:45.726 --> 01:04:50.143
It been a seven hour drive.
She's waiting outside.

01:04:50.226 --> 01:04:53.227
Please, please, just leave.

01:05:04.892 --> 01:05:07.060
Abigail, come on, sweetheart.
We gotta go.

01:05:23.392 --> 01:05:27.102
It wasn't the perfume,
it wasn't my great cooking...

01:05:27.184 --> 01:05:29.310
it was jealousy that woke the idiot.

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:30.852
Well, congratulations.

01:05:31.559 --> 01:05:34.102
I love him so damn much,
I missed his stutter.

01:05:45.809 --> 01:05:47.102
I'm going to the bathroom.

01:05:53.309 --> 01:05:55.185
Hi. I'm Abigail.

01:05:55.434 --> 01:05:57.185
You talk to my parents.

01:05:59.267 --> 01:06:00.935
I can't help you.

01:06:01.184 --> 01:06:02.810
Of course you can't,
I'm dying.

01:06:03.642 --> 01:06:05.143
You need that piece of bacon?

01:06:07.517 --> 01:06:09.602
I used to eggs and ate bacon.

01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:13.310
After being zap with the
electrocuted to me...

01:06:13.892 --> 01:06:15.393
I hate eggs and I love bacon.

01:06:16.226 --> 01:06:17.268
You'll figured.

01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:21.435
- I'm sorry you're so sick.
- Yeah, it's sucks.

01:06:27.351 --> 01:06:29.102
Oh, don't worry, it's not contagious.

01:06:31.976 --> 01:06:36.560
Look, Abigail, I'm not the healer.

01:06:37.851 --> 01:06:39.852
Healers don't exist, Alec.

01:06:41.684 --> 01:06:43.977
But this is what we're gonna do.
You and me.

01:06:44.059 --> 01:06:45.539
We gonna hangout for the weekend.

01:06:45.601 --> 01:06:47.435
That's how long we here on Lunenburg.

01:06:48.851 --> 01:06:52.102
Look. My parents drove
me here, seven hours.

01:06:52.184 --> 01:06:54.518
I don't wanna come.
You know why I said yes?

01:06:56.142 --> 01:07:00.185
Because... They really believe
that you've a good shot to curing me.

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:02.185
Abigail, I...

01:07:02.267 --> 01:07:04.852
Don't call me by my name,
if you gonna patronize.

01:07:07.767 --> 01:07:10.247
Listen, they just realized
that I'm talking to you.

01:07:10.851 --> 01:07:13.518
My parents has gone to so
much shit because of me.

01:07:13.892 --> 01:07:16.518
Three hospitals, four years
living in the suitcases.

01:07:16.601 --> 01:07:19.310
So... This is my gift to them.

01:07:19.851 --> 01:07:21.435
- I can't...
- Yes you can.

01:07:21.517 --> 01:07:23.102
Because you don't even
have to do anything.

01:07:23.434 --> 01:07:25.827
I'm not this nasty all the time.
It's two days.

01:07:25.851 --> 01:07:27.868
Then I'm gone, and when I die,
they won't complain.

01:07:27.892 --> 01:07:30.893
Darling, don't bother this man...

01:07:32.351 --> 01:07:36.227
Guess what? Alec reconsidered.
He will try to cure me.

01:07:37.601 --> 01:07:38.810
Oh my God!

01:07:41.267 --> 01:07:43.352
Thank you, thank you.

01:07:43.434 --> 01:07:47.185
Now, mom, dad, Alec can't
promises this gonna work.

01:07:47.809 --> 01:07:49.477
No, we don't. It's okay.

01:07:50.101 --> 01:07:53.060
So me and him, we gonna spend
most of the weekend together.

01:07:53.226 --> 01:07:56.143
That's how it works.
Right, Alec?

01:08:00.226 --> 01:08:02.102
Yeah, Yup.

01:08:02.934 --> 01:08:06.227
That's a... That's how it works.

01:08:19.059 --> 01:08:20.643
So, where we gonna go?

01:08:20.934 --> 01:08:24.602
To work, I work for a vet.

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:27.602
- Cool! I love animals!
- Yeah?

01:08:27.684 --> 01:08:29.893
Yeah, doctors never allow me
to get a dog.

01:08:29.975 --> 01:08:32.560
Now I'm allow, but,
I don't want to do that now.

01:08:35.892 --> 01:08:38.560
If you feel sorry for me, I will
kick you where it hurts.

01:08:44.475 --> 01:08:45.475
What?

01:08:47.225 --> 01:08:48.352
It's not mine.

01:08:49.809 --> 01:08:50.852
Just get in.

01:09:08.975 --> 01:09:10.185
Hey!

01:09:12.892 --> 01:09:15.227
Cecilia, this is Abigail.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.977
We're gonna hangout
together for the weekend.

01:09:19.392 --> 01:09:21.060
Nice to meet you, Abigail.

01:09:21.142 --> 01:09:23.227
Hi.
Sorry for just showing up like this.

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:26.149
Alec will explain,
but basically, my parents think...

01:09:26.167 --> 01:09:28.643
he has a shot curing me,
so, we're faking it.

01:09:29.559 --> 01:09:31.518
I thought that she can help up
around the farm.

01:09:31.975 --> 01:09:34.810
- Yes. I want to be a vet too.
- Awesome!

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:37.477
Is that a Border Collie?

01:09:38.017 --> 01:09:40.185
Yep, his name is "Batman."

01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:41.643
I love them!

01:09:44.142 --> 01:09:46.143
I am sorry.
I should've...

01:09:47.559 --> 01:09:50.018
- She begged me.
- Of course, it's fine.

01:09:50.809 --> 01:09:53.352
She says it's some kind of
gift to her parents,

01:09:53.434 --> 01:09:54.893
so they don't lose there hope.

01:09:55.351 --> 01:09:56.685
She seems nice.

01:09:57.559 --> 01:09:58.559
Yes.

01:09:59.642 --> 01:10:00.977
She has cancer.

01:10:02.309 --> 01:10:06.518
She's not gonna make it.
But she's wisely.

01:11:02.601 --> 01:11:03.601
Are you okay?

01:11:19.726 --> 01:11:23.393
So... when were you first diagnosed?

01:11:24.226 --> 01:11:26.102
Third of April, four years ago.

01:11:27.101 --> 01:11:28.727
You must be in shock.

01:11:28.851 --> 01:11:30.435
Not really. I mean...

01:11:30.559 --> 01:11:33.893
I was lucky, because my doctor at
the time was very cool.

01:11:34.434 --> 01:11:35.935
He refused to call it cancer,

01:11:36.017 --> 01:11:38.810
He said there were too many
bad connotations with the word.

01:11:39.809 --> 01:11:42.560
My diagnosis was
"bad cases of marshmallow."

01:11:45.184 --> 01:11:46.185
<i>I like that.</i>

01:11:46.976 --> 01:11:49.893
So... You two have a thing going?

01:11:51.309 --> 01:11:53.435
- No.
- No.

01:11:53.517 --> 01:11:57.102
- Please...
- No, really, we don't, we just friends.

01:11:57.517 --> 01:11:59.518
That's not what Batman told me.

01:12:02.684 --> 01:12:03.602
Are you okay?

01:12:03.684 --> 01:12:06.768
No, I have terminal marshmallow.

01:12:08.351 --> 01:12:11.393
- How about I take you back?
- That will be good.

01:12:11.726 --> 01:12:13.310
I may need some oxygen.

01:12:14.059 --> 01:12:17.060
Alright,
so I'll be seeing you both tomorrow?

01:12:19.642 --> 01:12:20.685
Thanks.

01:12:20.851 --> 01:12:22.185
I love it here.

01:12:25.517 --> 01:12:26.560
Follow me!

01:12:32.767 --> 01:12:33.767
What?

01:12:33.934 --> 01:12:35.227
You like her, don't you?

01:12:36.726 --> 01:12:37.893
She's beautiful...

01:12:39.226 --> 01:12:40.727
Yes, she is.

01:12:41.267 --> 01:12:44.143
But, it's not possible.

01:12:44.726 --> 01:12:46.185
Why, because you work for her?

01:12:48.976 --> 01:12:50.185
Can you keep a secret?

01:12:54.767 --> 01:12:56.977
Cecilia likes women.

01:12:57.059 --> 01:12:59.977
Oh bullcrap from Mars!
No, she doesn't!

01:13:00.267 --> 01:13:01.267
She does.

01:13:01.309 --> 01:13:04.477
Look, I know lesbians,
and Cecilia is not.

01:13:04.559 --> 01:13:05.977
Oh, so you are an expert? Are you?

01:13:06.059 --> 01:13:07.768
My sister is a lesbian and yes, I am.

01:13:07.851 --> 01:13:08.977
Oh, you have a sister?

01:13:09.601 --> 01:13:11.851
Yes, she's 25,
and she's a megalesbian,

01:13:11.886 --> 01:13:14.102
Which makes me an expert.

01:13:14.184 --> 01:13:15.477
She's lying.

01:13:17.809 --> 01:13:19.643
Why? She's lying to you?

01:13:21.434 --> 01:13:23.393
Is a whole other matter.

01:13:25.809 --> 01:13:28.310
Wait wait. What do you mean?

01:13:28.517 --> 01:13:29.685
Just get in!

01:13:59.767 --> 01:14:00.768
Charlie.

01:14:02.059 --> 01:14:03.227
Charlie.

01:14:03.767 --> 01:14:04.767
Charlie.

01:14:07.226 --> 01:14:08.226
Charlie!

01:14:08.392 --> 01:14:09.392
Charlie!

01:14:12.851 --> 01:14:15.643
Open the door!
Open the door, Charlie!

01:14:15.976 --> 01:14:18.643
Abigail, open the door!
Charlie!

01:14:22.892 --> 01:14:23.893
Charlie...

01:15:36.517 --> 01:15:38.060
I need to ask you a question.

01:15:38.142 --> 01:15:40.477
- Are you drunk?
- Just one question.

01:15:43.726 --> 01:15:44.726
Okay.

01:15:45.017 --> 01:15:46.352
Could I saved her?

01:15:47.934 --> 01:15:50.727
Abigail, Could I cured her?

01:15:51.184 --> 01:15:53.018
I do not know, Alec.

01:15:53.142 --> 01:15:54.977
Please don't say that.

01:15:58.684 --> 01:16:00.143
Could I cured Charlie?

01:16:01.601 --> 01:16:04.643
- Charlie?
- Charlie, he's my brother, Charlie.

01:16:05.309 --> 01:16:06.852
He died to marshmallow!

01:16:10.017 --> 01:16:11.477
I can't watch her die.

01:16:14.309 --> 01:16:17.852
- Why don't you come inside?
- He was the smart one.

01:16:18.184 --> 01:16:21.518
He came up with the "the healer" idea.

01:16:22.059 --> 01:16:25.143
It wasn't the stupid things...

01:16:27.017 --> 01:16:28.893
We have 20 stores ready...

01:16:28.976 --> 01:16:31.602
I'm so sorry, Alec.

01:16:33.434 --> 01:16:37.893
When he died, everything died.

01:16:39.517 --> 01:16:41.018
He was my everything.

01:16:45.017 --> 01:16:46.477
Can I get the gift back?

01:16:47.017 --> 01:16:50.310
- You heard Raymond, it's not possible.
- Please...

01:16:55.767 --> 01:16:57.852
- Okay, why don't you come inside?
- I don't...

01:16:58.976 --> 01:17:00.018
Come on.

01:17:05.351 --> 01:17:07.518
- You all packed?
- Yes, I have everything.

01:17:07.601 --> 01:17:09.441
- You do?
- Don't worry, I'll be fine.

01:17:09.476 --> 01:17:10.893
- Sunscreen?
- Yes.

01:17:11.851 --> 01:17:13.060
She will be alright.

01:17:14.309 --> 01:17:15.393
Hey there!

01:17:15.934 --> 01:17:17.602
- Hi!
- Where's Alec?

01:17:17.684 --> 01:17:21.018
- He asked me to picked up Abigail.
- Its fine mom. She's the vet.

01:17:21.642 --> 01:17:23.935
- Okay, we'll see you at six.
- Okay. Bye.

01:17:24.017 --> 01:17:25.268
Have a good time, sweetheart.

01:17:29.726 --> 01:17:31.268
All good?

01:17:32.309 --> 01:17:33.309
Bye baby.

01:17:39.809 --> 01:17:43.060
So, did you get some good
sleep last night?

01:17:43.309 --> 01:17:44.309
Yeah.

01:17:46.017 --> 01:17:47.727
Alec told me you onto chicks.

01:17:48.809 --> 01:17:49.685
What?

01:17:49.767 --> 01:17:53.227
I promised him not to tell you.
I said, I didn't buy it.

01:17:55.726 --> 01:17:59.560
Yeah, I kinda told him that,
so that he wouldn't hit on me.

01:17:59.976 --> 01:18:00.976
I knew it.

01:18:03.226 --> 01:18:04.393
He's cute...

01:18:04.684 --> 01:18:06.852
Yeah, he is cute.

01:18:06.934 --> 01:18:09.143
So, why don't you want him to hit on you?

01:18:09.226 --> 01:18:13.268
Well, he has quite the reputation...

01:18:13.809 --> 01:18:15.727
- He's a hothead.
- Oh yeah?

01:18:15.809 --> 01:18:18.685
Yeah, his uncle actually warned me.

01:18:21.142 --> 01:18:24.602
So, last night Alec actually fell
asleep at my place.

01:18:24.684 --> 01:18:26.352
Alright, now we talking!

01:18:26.434 --> 01:18:29.477
No, he was drunk and
he fell asleep.

01:18:32.392 --> 01:18:35.518
Seriously, I'm not kidding.
You'll see for yourself.

01:19:12.184 --> 01:19:14.102
I hope heaven just like this.

01:19:15.101 --> 01:19:16.185
Me too.

01:19:22.142 --> 01:19:23.435
What about you, Alec?

01:19:27.976 --> 01:19:29.268
I'm not sure.

01:19:29.892 --> 01:19:31.643
That's one shity answer.

01:19:35.642 --> 01:19:37.852
Well, if there is a heaven, then...

01:19:37.934 --> 01:19:38.934
If...?

01:19:39.226 --> 01:19:41.560
What do you think happens when you die?

01:19:42.184 --> 01:19:43.727
Has anybody in your family died?

01:19:46.767 --> 01:19:47.852
All of them.

01:19:53.101 --> 01:19:57.060
My twin brother...
He had what you have.

01:20:00.476 --> 01:20:01.477
What his name?

01:20:03.726 --> 01:20:04.727
Charlie.

01:20:05.559 --> 01:20:06.559
When?

01:20:07.226 --> 01:20:08.310
Two years ago.

01:20:11.976 --> 01:20:13.018
Charlie...

01:20:16.809 --> 01:20:18.689
Charlie must be so pissed
off with you.

01:20:19.851 --> 01:20:20.893
- Why?
- Why?

01:20:20.976 --> 01:20:23.685
For thinking that he just went
poof and he still exist!

01:20:31.184 --> 01:20:33.477
You're an idiot, Alec Bailey.

01:20:36.351 --> 01:20:38.393
Is that the reason you lost your smile?

01:20:41.809 --> 01:20:42.935
Maybe.

01:20:45.226 --> 01:20:46.268
Come here.

01:20:49.392 --> 01:20:52.727
I promise when I get to heaven
I'll send you a message.

01:20:52.892 --> 01:20:53.892
Oh yeah?

01:20:54.892 --> 01:20:57.018
Probably scared the crap off you.

01:20:59.892 --> 01:21:01.268
Yes, that's for sure.

01:21:07.309 --> 01:21:09.227
So sucks the weekend is over.

01:21:10.309 --> 01:21:12.893
I wish I had told my parents it's
took a month for this to work.

01:21:12.976 --> 01:21:14.560
A month? No thanks.

01:21:23.559 --> 01:21:25.768
<i>Now we gonna go to "Give me
some loving", a classic...</i>

01:21:25.851 --> 01:21:27.060
Stop the truck!

01:21:27.142 --> 01:21:28.143
What?

01:21:28.226 --> 01:21:29.827
Alec, stop the truck!
I need to get out!

01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:31.477
- Are you okay?
- Just stop the truck!

01:21:31.559 --> 01:21:32.977
Stop it! Stop it!

01:21:33.059 --> 01:21:35.893
- Alright, alright, alright.
- Stop it! Stop it!

01:21:36.184 --> 01:21:37.435
Stop the truck!

01:21:43.101 --> 01:21:44.643
I love this song.

01:21:45.059 --> 01:21:46.819
This is our war song
at the hospital.

01:21:47.726 --> 01:21:49.643
When this song come on,
we all danced.

01:21:49.726 --> 01:21:51.185
Now the three of us gonna dance.

01:21:51.934 --> 01:21:52.934
Come on!

01:21:55.851 --> 01:21:59.102
- I don't dance.
- Are you kidding?

01:21:59.184 --> 01:22:00.810
How can you not dance to this?

01:22:01.184 --> 01:22:03.227
- Alright, then play the guitar.
- What?

01:22:03.309 --> 01:22:05.393
Play the air guitar, like this!

01:22:07.059 --> 01:22:08.352
Come on, come on, come on.

01:23:13.726 --> 01:23:14.893
You gonna give me another ticket?

01:23:16.267 --> 01:23:18.518
- Hi, Uncle Tom.
- Hi there sweetie.

01:23:20.059 --> 01:23:21.477
Everything okay here?

01:23:21.976 --> 01:23:22.976
The best.

01:23:25.059 --> 01:23:27.227
- Would you come here a second?
- Why?

01:23:27.851 --> 01:23:28.977
Just come here.

01:23:45.434 --> 01:23:47.268
Just wanted to thank you for this...

01:23:48.601 --> 01:23:50.393
Her father is my brother.

01:23:52.392 --> 01:23:54.810
I haven't seen him this happy for...

01:23:58.226 --> 01:23:59.477
A long time.

01:24:18.309 --> 01:24:20.435
- It getting cold.
Shut up, Alec.

01:24:20.517 --> 01:24:22.268
I'm gonna die, not from the weather.

01:26:24.601 --> 01:26:27.685
Wait. I don't want to say goodbye
in front of my parents.

01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:34.393
I hate goodbyes, so, rule number one,
no one gets emotional.

01:26:35.892 --> 01:26:36.685
Deal?

01:26:36.767 --> 01:26:38.102
- Deal.
- Deal.

01:26:39.059 --> 01:26:41.102
I wrote you guys a poem.

01:26:41.851 --> 01:26:43.518
Don't worry, it's really short.

01:26:44.601 --> 01:26:45.977
It's called "Just Breathe."

01:26:49.059 --> 01:26:50.935
We all at some point,
stopped breathing.

01:26:52.309 --> 01:26:54.518
What if we lived one
breath at the time?

01:26:55.476 --> 01:26:58.643
e speak a thou breathing is
easy because it is a nate.

01:26:59.267 --> 01:27:01.643
- Is that a cool word or what?
- Yes...

01:27:02.767 --> 01:27:06.143
Half the time we don't
even notice our breath.

01:27:07.267 --> 01:27:09.268
When did breathing
become the uncool kids?

01:27:09.351 --> 01:27:11.102
That all the other body part is ignore?

01:27:11.351 --> 01:27:14.310
Think about the phrase
"catch your breath".

01:27:14.934 --> 01:27:17.685
You have to catch it, because
you've lost control of it.

01:27:21.184 --> 01:27:25.310
Alec and Cecilia, find
control of your breath,

01:27:26.101 --> 01:27:30.060
and, please, live for me like
tomorrow was your last day.

01:27:34.392 --> 01:27:36.352
Cecilia, we made a deal.

01:27:57.142 --> 01:27:58.142
Thanks, Alec.

01:27:59.767 --> 01:28:02.102
I thought that this would
be good for my parents,

01:28:02.184 --> 01:28:04.893
but... It been incredible for me also.

01:28:07.601 --> 01:28:08.810
Well, it's was...

01:28:11.101 --> 01:28:13.102
It was special for me too.

01:28:14.101 --> 01:28:16.685
Dear Jesus, he shown his feelings!

01:28:17.809 --> 01:28:19.268
Trust me on this, Alec.

01:28:20.017 --> 01:28:23.810
Charlie is in a better place and
he just wants you to be happy.

01:28:30.809 --> 01:28:31.727
I take you back.

01:28:31.809 --> 01:28:34.018
Please!
I can see my parents from here.

01:28:41.184 --> 01:28:45.602
Oh! One more thing... She's lied,
She's not in to girls.

01:28:45.684 --> 01:28:49.268
And... I lied.
I don't have a sister

01:28:49.559 --> 01:28:50.559
Bye!

01:28:54.809 --> 01:28:57.643
Hold on a minute, why did you lie?

01:28:57.726 --> 01:29:00.014
Your uncle said that
you were a loose wire,

01:29:00.114 --> 01:29:01.602
and that you were trying
to get in my pants.

01:29:01.684 --> 01:29:03.602
You're pretty sure of your self,
aren't you?

01:29:03.684 --> 01:29:06.852
You asked me out,
three minutes into meeting me.

01:29:06.934 --> 01:29:09.185
This is unbelievable.
I'm gonna have a word with him.

01:29:10.351 --> 01:29:13.477
Well, you might want to talk him today,
since he's leaving tomorrow.

01:29:14.059 --> 01:29:15.518
Wait, he still here?

01:29:15.601 --> 01:29:18.143
Yes, he's at your house, or him house.

01:29:20.142 --> 01:29:21.893
I need to talk to him, come on.

01:29:30.101 --> 01:29:31.185
Raymond!

01:29:32.309 --> 01:29:33.518
I'm down.

01:29:36.142 --> 01:29:39.018
One or two thing I had to do
then I'll gone.

01:29:40.434 --> 01:29:41.643
I want my gift back.

01:29:42.517 --> 01:29:43.518
What?

01:29:43.976 --> 01:29:45.435
Its a bit late for that.

01:29:46.809 --> 01:29:48.852
Why the sudden change of heart.

01:29:48.934 --> 01:29:52.977
It doesn't matter why. I made
a mistake, now I want it back.

01:29:53.142 --> 01:29:54.977
Alec, I made it very clear.

01:29:55.059 --> 01:29:58.643
I know what you said about my
birthday and midnight, but...

01:30:00.017 --> 01:30:01.643
There is gonna be some other way.

01:30:01.934 --> 01:30:04.727
- I don't make the rules.
- Who does?

01:30:04.809 --> 01:30:06.393
Who do I have to commit?

01:30:06.642 --> 01:30:10.060
Well, Alec, that would be the one that
you don't believe in.

01:30:10.767 --> 01:30:13.310
I am just an ant on this planet.

01:30:14.351 --> 01:30:18.352
There must be some kind of clue,
like a time span or something.

01:30:18.434 --> 01:30:21.060
- I'm afraid not.
- There isn't, Alec.

01:30:21.892 --> 01:30:24.810
I was... I was freaking out, okay?

01:30:24.892 --> 01:30:28.518
I didn't know what I was doing...
I have sheep following me!

01:30:29.476 --> 01:30:31.643
- You made your choice.
- Choice?

01:30:31.767 --> 01:30:35.893
I'm Sorry, how I was suppose to suddenly
just accept that I had a weird superpower?

01:30:35.976 --> 01:30:39.935
I didn't have any time to
understand and reflect.

01:30:40.017 --> 01:30:43.268
And now, I know I can
help, so I want it back.

01:30:44.267 --> 01:30:46.768
- Too late.
- You told me I was the healer...

01:30:51.226 --> 01:30:52.560
Where is my frame?

01:30:53.851 --> 01:30:55.310
I took it down.

01:30:56.809 --> 01:30:58.477
We didn't need it anymore.

01:31:01.767 --> 01:31:04.685
You were played me, like a puppet.

01:31:05.684 --> 01:31:07.560
I should know this from the start.

01:31:07.642 --> 01:31:10.768
- That's not the way it's works.
- Bullshit about how it works...

01:31:10.851 --> 01:31:12.435
or we know how its works.

01:31:12.517 --> 01:31:13.653
A little honesty and maybe...

01:31:13.677 --> 01:31:14.827
I would've made the right decision.

01:31:14.851 --> 01:31:16.643
- Wait...
- Don't touch me!

01:31:17.142 --> 01:31:18.643
You could stop this.

01:31:20.559 --> 01:31:22.435
Maybe I can saved Abigail.

01:31:28.184 --> 01:31:29.768
It not up to us anymore.

01:31:31.601 --> 01:31:32.893
Better leave him be.

01:31:41.642 --> 01:31:42.893
Father Malloy!

01:31:46.184 --> 01:31:47.184
Hello!

01:31:50.684 --> 01:31:51.684
Alec?

01:31:52.517 --> 01:31:55.060
What are you doing?
This place is closed at this hour.

01:31:55.392 --> 01:31:57.227
Well, open it. I need to go in there.

01:31:57.517 --> 01:31:58.602
What's going on?

01:32:01.851 --> 01:32:03.143
How do I talk to him?

01:32:03.642 --> 01:32:04.477
Who?

01:32:04.559 --> 01:32:06.227
Him, him, your boss, him.

01:32:07.226 --> 01:32:07.977
God?

01:32:08.059 --> 01:32:09.059
Yes!

01:32:10.684 --> 01:32:13.393
You just talk, he listens.

01:32:14.517 --> 01:32:16.435
Okay. Can you just do it for me?

01:32:17.892 --> 01:32:20.310
- No, I can't do that.
- Look, you owe me!

01:32:21.976 --> 01:32:23.852
You're right. I do.

01:32:33.184 --> 01:32:36.560
But this... You gotta do alone.

01:32:39.184 --> 01:32:40.852
Just close the door when you're done.

01:32:44.184 --> 01:32:45.185
Thank you.

01:33:05.851 --> 01:33:07.143
This is ridiculous.

01:33:09.226 --> 01:33:11.185
Actually, do you know what?

01:33:11.601 --> 01:33:13.852
What kind of thing are you? Huh?

01:33:14.767 --> 01:33:16.810
I mean, if good like you say you are,

01:33:16.892 --> 01:33:19.602
then why let young people
get sick and die?

01:33:19.892 --> 01:33:22.102
Why don't you start
by answering me that?

01:33:22.184 --> 01:33:25.185
I mean, Abigail?
Are you serious?

01:33:25.267 --> 01:33:27.018
Are you that perverse?

01:33:27.267 --> 01:33:28.977
She's 14 years old!

01:33:31.642 --> 01:33:33.685
Now you give me back my gift!

01:33:36.684 --> 01:33:40.727
I swear...
If you let Abigail die,

01:33:40.809 --> 01:33:43.143
I curse that you never existing.

01:33:44.684 --> 01:33:45.684
Charlie.

01:33:45.726 --> 01:33:49.602
Charlie, if you're up there,
punch this idiot in the face for me.

01:33:52.309 --> 01:33:53.727
I want it back!

01:34:32.767 --> 01:34:36.643
Cause maybe it's old, Josh.

01:34:36.726 --> 01:34:39.268
I know. My wife had convinced
me to buy another.

01:34:39.351 --> 01:34:41.602
- Here let grab something?
- No, no please.

01:34:41.684 --> 01:34:43.084
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:34:43.767 --> 01:34:45.018
Beers on me, anytime.

01:34:45.351 --> 01:34:46.935
- See you.
- Later.

01:34:56.392 --> 01:34:57.435
How are you?

01:34:59.517 --> 01:35:01.310
Yeah, I'm good.

01:35:02.351 --> 01:35:05.977
I... I bought you a gift.

01:35:07.684 --> 01:35:09.393
They're "Forget-Me-Not."

01:35:10.684 --> 01:35:13.105
I figure that they can be a symbol of...

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:15.827
renewed friendship or something,

01:35:17.142 --> 01:35:20.977
and, now it feels really cheesy
to bought that up.

01:35:30.517 --> 01:35:34.560
I'm really sorry...
About how it all played out.

01:35:35.934 --> 01:35:38.102
There was no need to lie all the time.

01:35:38.351 --> 01:35:39.935
Your uncle asked me to.

01:35:41.809 --> 01:35:43.352
That you said you are a lesbian...

01:35:52.976 --> 01:35:54.643
About Abigail...

01:35:55.142 --> 01:35:56.142
Please...

01:35:57.934 --> 01:36:01.810
I blamed you for Abigail and...

01:36:03.309 --> 01:36:04.310
I am sorry.

01:36:06.892 --> 01:36:10.685
I'm an idiot, alright, I was always
gonna made the wrong choice.

01:36:10.767 --> 01:36:12.007
Alec, She wrote us a letter.

01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:14.267
What?

01:36:14.892 --> 01:36:18.935
It's... One of the reasons that I cut
the courage to come and see today.

01:36:23.476 --> 01:36:24.477
What's it say?

01:36:24.559 --> 01:36:26.435
I don't know.
I wanted to read it with you.

01:36:35.101 --> 01:36:36.101
<i>CALL ME</i>

01:36:37.142 --> 01:36:38.268
Where is your phone?

01:36:42.434 --> 01:36:46.018
5065550174.

01:36:53.434 --> 01:36:55.060
<i>- Yes?
- Abigail...</i>

01:36:55.184 --> 01:36:57.393
- It's Alec and Cecilia.
- Hi!

01:36:57.726 --> 01:37:00.352
<i>What took you guys so damn long!
You were supposed to call me</i>

01:37:00.434 --> 01:37:02.935
I'm so sorry.
We just opened your letter.

01:37:03.517 --> 01:37:04.893
So, how are you both?

01:37:04.976 --> 01:37:08.518
<i>- Fine...
- Yeah, we're fine. How are you?</i>

01:37:08.934 --> 01:37:10.227
I'm good.

01:37:11.434 --> 01:37:14.268
So I have some news, guys.

01:37:15.351 --> 01:37:16.351
Okay.

01:37:16.392 --> 01:37:17.392
Okay...

01:37:17.851 --> 01:37:21.935
turns out about a year ago I was
put on Palliative Care.

01:37:22.601 --> 01:37:24.935
Bottom line, it's like a death sentence,

01:37:25.017 --> 01:37:26.852
because Chemotherapy
was no longer working.

01:37:27.767 --> 01:37:28.767
Right.

01:37:29.976 --> 01:37:30.976
But...

01:37:31.476 --> 01:37:32.476
But what?

01:37:33.892 --> 01:37:36.977
When got back, I bump into the
marshmallow doctor I told you about.

01:37:37.476 --> 01:37:41.393
He was surprised that I look so healthy,
so he want to try a few test.

01:37:42.892 --> 01:37:46.602
You won't believe this,
some kind of weird remission.

01:37:46.934 --> 01:37:48.477
- What is that mean?
- Wait.

01:37:48.559 --> 01:37:51.018
What is that,
what "some kind of weird remission"?

01:37:51.101 --> 01:37:52.893
I know, I don't understand either.

01:37:52.976 --> 01:37:55.768
Well.
A: Somehow the cancers is going away.

01:37:55.851 --> 01:37:58.852
B: They're gonna give me a treatment
to get rid of what's still there.

01:37:58.934 --> 01:38:02.352
And C: I'm not gonna die.

01:38:02.434 --> 01:38:04.768
And... I'll be there for Christmas.

01:38:06.434 --> 01:38:07.434
What?

01:38:11.184 --> 01:38:12.935
<i>Guys, I'm still on the phone here!</i>

01:38:13.017 --> 01:38:14.893
Sorry, sorry!

01:38:16.059 --> 01:38:17.059
Hey, Alec.

01:38:17.142 --> 01:38:18.227
<i>Yes.</i>

01:38:18.351 --> 01:38:21.185
You should tell everyone that you
cured me. Take the credit.

01:38:21.267 --> 01:38:23.393
<i>My parents are convinced
that it was you.</i>

01:38:23.976 --> 01:38:26.893
And get ready because they're sending
over three baskets of fruit.

01:38:27.142 --> 01:38:29.727
Spoiler alert!
Don't touch the apples.

01:38:29.809 --> 01:38:31.018
<i>It's sucks.</i>

01:38:31.101 --> 01:38:32.102
Alright.

01:38:32.184 --> 01:38:34.518
Listen. I gotta go. Call me

01:38:36.392 --> 01:38:39.727
Yes, and say hi to your
sister for us.

01:38:41.309 --> 01:38:45.602
Cecilia, if you haven't kissed
this idiot by now, should hurry up and do it.

01:38:46.059 --> 01:38:47.060
Love you guys!

01:38:50.517 --> 01:38:51.518
Bye.

01:38:58.767 --> 01:39:00.143
This is unbelievable.

01:39:11.351 --> 01:39:14.352
- Wait wait! Stop, stop!
- What?

01:39:16.476 --> 01:39:18.268
I just landed on this.

01:39:58.851 --> 01:40:00.060
What are you...?

01:40:00.142 --> 01:40:03.477
I'm just gonna get some water.
Go back to sleep.

01:40:21.267 --> 01:40:23.352
You scared the crap out me!
What are you doing here?

01:40:23.434 --> 01:40:24.810
It's my home.

01:40:25.851 --> 01:40:28.768
I had something to do in the basement.

01:40:33.101 --> 01:40:34.435
Can I ask you a question?

01:40:36.517 --> 01:40:38.893
When your father found out
that he was a healer,

01:40:38.976 --> 01:40:42.435
I he...
Did he accepted the gift immediately?

01:40:43.809 --> 01:40:46.477
No. No, he didn't.

01:40:48.351 --> 01:40:50.102
He didn't want the gift.

01:40:51.226 --> 01:40:54.560
But something happened
to made him change his mind.

01:40:55.059 --> 01:40:56.102
What happened?

01:40:56.184 --> 01:41:00.102
Frankly, Alec,
that's now none of your business.

01:41:04.642 --> 01:41:06.143
She not gonna die, you know?

01:41:07.101 --> 01:41:12.477
Abigail, the little girl.
She... She remission.

01:41:13.017 --> 01:41:14.018
Really?

01:41:14.642 --> 01:41:16.060
Well, that is good news.

01:41:17.517 --> 01:41:18.518
Bye, Alec.

01:41:18.934 --> 01:41:19.977
Bye.

01:41:24.934 --> 01:41:25.934
Oh, Alec.

01:41:28.476 --> 01:41:30.977
Ever notice anything odd about yourself?

01:41:56.601 --> 01:41:57.601
Batman?

01:41:59.851 --> 01:42:00.893
Oh my God!

01:42:04.142 --> 01:42:09.760
Cecilia!
