02:16.333 --> 02:17.958
Stop moving him!

02:19.750 --> 02:21.667
Don't shake the fence!

02:23.667 --> 02:26.125
It's OK, stop.
We're going to get you down.

02:28.958 --> 02:30.708
Hold on to me!

02:34.875 --> 02:35.792
Help me, for fuck's sake!

02:39.083 --> 02:40.875
Move it! Get up here!

02:42.042 --> 02:43.500
Move it!

02:50.958 --> 02:54.000
The wire's tangled!
Try to cut it right there!

02:54.125 --> 02:56.417
I'll get hold here and cut through it.

02:59.167 --> 03:00.625
You can't be here!

03:01.083 --> 03:02.250
Go away!

03:05.875 --> 03:09.458
Don't shake the fence!
Don't shake the fucking fence!

03:18.708 --> 03:21.417
More migrants arriving from the shelter
to assist those crossing.

03:21.542 --> 03:22.583
Let me go!

03:47.750 --> 03:50.000
Just fucking stay still!

03:52.542 --> 03:53.708
Stop!

03:53.833 --> 03:54.958
Stop, stop!

03:55.042 --> 03:57.417
Just fucking stay still!

03:57.750 --> 03:59.167
Stop shaking the fence!

03:59.333 --> 04:00.708
Don't move...

04:17.541 --> 04:19.708
Miguel! Miguel, are you OK?

04:27.708 --> 04:29.125
He's not breathing.

04:47.708 --> 04:48.833
I'm OK.

04:50.167 --> 04:51.958

Look out for the bumps!

06:32.458 --> 06:33.750
It's my turn.

06:33.875 --> 06:35.917
It's late, mama will be angry.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.250
You promised, Ali!

10:30.500 --> 10:32.458
You're going to tell Kato.

10:33.417 --> 10:35.875
How will I get to Avebe now?

10:39.500 --> 10:40.750
It's all your fault.

10:40.875 --> 10:42.083
It's not my fault.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.875
-I didn't want to go there.
-Adu is six.

10:44.958 --> 10:47.000
He does what you say.
You're the oldest.

10:47.125 --> 10:49.958
But you asked me
to teach him to ride a bicycle.

10:50.042 --> 10:51.083
In the village.

10:51.208 --> 10:52.667
Not on those tracks.

10:57.167 --> 10:58.917
It was Kimba.

11:01.750 --> 11:05.792
-What?
-The elephant they killed was Kimba.

11:14.542 --> 11:17.250
It was probably recorded
by an immigrant from the shelter.

11:19.333 --> 11:21.917
-Is that all it shows?
-It's been up a few days.

11:23.125 --> 11:25.542
The Refugee Aid people
have made a complaint.

11:26.333 --> 11:27.583
Fucking great.

11:27.708 --> 11:30.375
It's to force the judge to request
access to the fence cameras.

11:31.250 --> 11:33.042
What can you see
from the fence cameras?

11:33.792 --> 11:35.458
Nothing. You can't see anything.

11:35.583 --> 11:37.542
We tried to get him down, end of story.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.708
Will we have to go to court?

11:39.833 --> 11:43.125
First thing we do
is talk to the chief, but it's OK.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.917
Because what happened...

11:45.000 --> 11:46.250
is what the report says.

11:46.417 --> 11:48.917
He died because of a fall, end of story.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.000
You're sure there are no more videos?

11:51.667 --> 11:52.958
What videos?

11:54.750 --> 11:56.917
You're pushing that defence hard.

11:57.042 --> 11:58.708
What defence, Mateo?

12:39.625 --> 12:40.792
Adu.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.417
Adu...

12:43.042 --> 12:44.583
Come here!

12:57.375 --> 12:58.375
Come.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.375
Come.

13:21.208 --> 13:22.542
Sit here.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.375
Come closer.

13:34.833 --> 13:35.917
Adu...

13:36.917 --> 13:39.792
You know I'm a friend
of your father's, don't you?

13:39.917 --> 13:41.750
Yes, Monsieur Neko.

13:42.375 --> 13:44.583
I take care of your family.

13:45.250 --> 13:48.208
Who found the water cans
for your mother?

13:48.750 --> 13:50.667
You did, Monsieur Neko.

13:50.958 --> 13:53.917
I have a friend in Mengueme
who needs a good bike

13:54.000 --> 13:56.292
to carry his cassava to market.

13:56.667 --> 13:59.792
I thought of your bike,
the one that belongs to Kato.

13:59.917 --> 14:02.292
My friend will pay a good price for it.

14:06.833 --> 14:07.875
No.

14:08.042 --> 14:09.208
No, what?

14:09.958 --> 14:11.667
Is something wrong?

14:15.542 --> 14:17.250
I lost it.

14:17.458 --> 14:18.917
What happened, Adu?

14:19.125 --> 14:20.625
You can tell me.

14:46.417 --> 14:47.250
Yes?

14:47.417 --> 14:48.417
What is it?

14:50.333 --> 14:51.333
What?

14:52.167 --> 14:54.500
No, I'll go to Yaoundé to pick her up.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.583
Yes, at the airport.

14:56.708 --> 14:58.750
No, no taxis, she can wait for me.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.708
Did she get her vaccinations?

15:05.417 --> 15:06.917
Her vaccinations.

15:08.333 --> 15:09.708
Did you ask her?

15:11.083 --> 15:13.375
I know she's not 12,
but she might as well be.

15:14.792 --> 15:15.792
OK.

15:16.042 --> 15:17.958
OK. Bye.

17:51.875 --> 17:52.750
Leave him.

17:54.375 --> 17:55.750
Let him go.

19:22.625 --> 19:24.500
Run! Run!

19:26.375 --> 19:27.667
Watch out!

21:38.125 --> 21:40.333
Will mama be OK?

21:40.458 --> 21:42.042
I don't want to talk about that.

21:42.167 --> 21:43.625
Why not?

21:44.167 --> 21:46.583
Thinking about mama
won't help us now.

21:46.708 --> 21:48.208
What are we going to do?

21:49.250 --> 21:51.292
We'll go to Aunt Leke's.

21:51.542 --> 21:53.625
She'll help us call dad.

21:54.542 --> 21:56.458
And take us to Spain.

22:24.292 --> 22:26.958
{\an8}YAOUNDÉ
CAMEROON

23:02.167 --> 23:04.667
Mum told me
they killed another elephant.

23:06.500 --> 23:09.458
And that if you used drones
you could track them better.

23:10.833 --> 23:12.292
Do you know how much a drone costs?

23:12.833 --> 23:15.250
-And how many we'd need?
-You're rich.

23:15.375 --> 23:16.625
Me, rich?

23:17.125 --> 23:18.583
Your granddad was a count!

23:19.542 --> 23:21.875
No, granddad married
the widow of a count.

23:22.250 --> 23:23.750
I have nothing to do with that.

23:24.125 --> 23:27.333
What you do have is a mega apartment
in Madrid, one in London,

23:27.458 --> 23:29.583
-a house in Morocco...
-Two ex-wives,

23:29.708 --> 23:31.750
a daughter
who can't stay out of trouble...

23:34.500 --> 23:37.375
You have 36,000 Twitter followers,
if you ask for one Euro...

23:37.500 --> 23:39.333
Since when do you care about elephants?

23:39.750 --> 23:41.375
No, Dad. I care about you.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.417
Well, if you care about me,

23:43.542 --> 23:46.292
try not to cause me any trouble
while you're here.

23:46.417 --> 23:47.708
I didn't ask to come.

23:47.875 --> 23:50.500
I was perfectly happy in Madrid.
I'd got a job.

23:51.042 --> 23:52.250
What kind of job?

23:52.375 --> 23:54.500
A job. At the amusement park.

23:54.958 --> 23:57.167
-At the amusement park...
-Yes.

23:59.250 --> 24:01.083
Do you want some advice?

24:01.500 --> 24:02.667
Please.

24:02.833 --> 24:04.958
Use this trip to make a change.

24:08.167 --> 24:09.417
OK.

24:22.958 --> 24:24.208
Ali.

24:25.208 --> 24:26.625
Ali, I'm thirsty.

24:27.708 --> 24:29.625
Five minutes to rest.

24:33.125 --> 24:34.083
Adu!

24:34.208 --> 24:36.125
Ali, please.

25:12.042 --> 25:13.333
Stop it!

25:14.083 --> 25:15.458
Ali, stop it.

25:56.167 --> 25:57.917
What would you have done?

25:59.500 --> 26:00.958
What would I have done?

26:01.125 --> 26:03.708
If I died, what would you do?

26:08.292 --> 26:09.750
Carry on.

27:53.083 --> 27:54.375
Adu, hurry up!

27:55.250 --> 27:56.917
Hurry up!

27:58.292 --> 28:01.208
-What?
-A truck stopped, let's go.

28:39.583 --> 28:41.375
Adu! Adu!

29:41.250 --> 29:42.333
Hello?

29:42.458 --> 29:43.500
Hi.

29:55.375 --> 29:59.750
This guy was just telling me
that the only sign of elephants he's seen

29:59.833 --> 30:01.750
is the shit they leave on the roads.

30:02.125 --> 30:03.125
What are you smoking?

30:03.292 --> 30:04.500
Tobacco.

30:04.625 --> 30:05.917
Tobacco?

30:07.125 --> 30:08.375
Smell it.

30:09.625 --> 30:11.958
This is not Spain.
You get 15 years for a joint.

30:12.042 --> 30:14.292
Dad, it's tobacco. I swear.

30:17.042 --> 30:19.500
-Whose is the bike?
-I found it in the jungle.

30:20.500 --> 30:21.583
I love it.

30:21.708 --> 30:23.500
-Can I keep it?
-What for?

30:23.625 --> 30:25.375
I don't know, a souvenir of Africa.

30:28.667 --> 30:32.083
Make a 50 Euro donation
to the Du Dja reserve and it's yours.

30:32.208 --> 30:33.375
50 Euros?

30:33.458 --> 30:35.542
That's what a gram of coke
costs in Madrid, right?

30:38.292 --> 30:40.375
You have no fucking clue, dad!

30:40.500 --> 30:42.500
Look, if you're angry
take a diazepam.

30:42.958 --> 30:44.417
Do I look angry to you?

30:44.542 --> 30:46.708
-I don't know.
-Come on, let's go.

30:49.250 --> 30:50.375
Very nice.

31:19.375 --> 31:21.375
They're practically identical.

31:22.500 --> 31:24.500
-I'm sorry?
-The statements.

31:24.625 --> 31:26.292
Yours and the corporal's.

31:27.375 --> 31:28.833
That's what happened.

31:29.958 --> 31:32.833
When they storm the fence,
it's always a mess.

31:32.958 --> 31:34.208
Yes, sir.

31:35.542 --> 31:37.917
Lots of tension, lots of pressure.

31:38.542 --> 31:40.083
They teach you many things
at the academy.

31:40.208 --> 31:42.250
But not how to get people
off a fence.

31:42.375 --> 31:43.333
No, sir.

31:44.917 --> 31:48.750
Last night they threw quicklime
at four officers.

31:48.917 --> 31:50.667
I know, sir.

31:51.458 --> 31:52.708
Did they throw some at you?

31:53.208 --> 31:54.625
No, sir.

31:56.667 --> 31:57.917
What's your name?

31:58.000 --> 32:00.375
Mateo, sir.

32:02.125 --> 32:06.417
There are a lot people here
who'd love to show us up.

32:06.500 --> 32:08.667
Who don't understand what we do here.

32:08.833 --> 32:10.792
People looking for minor details,

32:11.375 --> 32:13.125
mistakes, to attack us.

32:18.917 --> 32:21.667
Do you know what I'm getting at, Mateo?

32:25.917 --> 32:28.125
There were only three of us, sir.
We did all we could.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.875
That's not what I'm asking you.

32:34.417 --> 32:36.917
There was no mistake, sir.

33:35.042 --> 33:37.167
They can't take all that stuff.

33:37.917 --> 33:39.375
The truck is full.

33:39.625 --> 33:41.917
If everyone brought a bag,
we wouldn't fit.

33:42.042 --> 33:43.958
Their father told me...

33:44.125 --> 33:45.958
Their father is in Spain.

33:46.042 --> 33:47.792
We take care of things here.

33:48.250 --> 33:50.083
One bag is enough
for the two of them.

33:53.917 --> 33:57.500
Don't forget, they'll let you call
once a week.

33:57.625 --> 34:02.042
Don't lose your father's number,
and take care of your brother.

35:18.292 --> 35:19.917
Shit! Shit!

35:23.417 --> 35:25.333
What's the police doing to that man?

35:26.958 --> 35:28.250
What is it?

35:44.750 --> 35:45.750
Shit!

35:50.667 --> 35:52.625
Change of plans.

35:52.750 --> 35:55.083
-What?
-You're going to Paris, by plane.

35:55.667 --> 35:59.042
-What do you mean by plane?
-You're in luck.

36:20.958 --> 36:22.958
You have to climb up the wheels, quick.

36:23.125 --> 36:24.458
The wheels?

36:24.583 --> 36:26.958
They're full of cables
you can hang on to.

36:27.083 --> 36:28.125
When you get up there

36:28.208 --> 36:30.333
look for the duct
that leads to the dog area.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.917
What dogs?

36:32.042 --> 36:35.500
Europeans fly with their dogs
but they put them below.

36:36.083 --> 36:38.208
-Is it safe?
-Super safe.

36:45.250 --> 36:50.167
You have to wrap up.
It's very cold in the air.

36:53.917 --> 36:55.458
It's this or nothing.

36:58.042 --> 37:00.083
-My father paid...
-To take you to Morocco!

37:00.250 --> 37:03.917
And we're taking you to Paris!
We're doing you a favour!

37:05.208 --> 37:06.542
Don't you want to go?

37:06.667 --> 37:09.833
Then stay here. This is all I can do.

37:14.958 --> 37:18.208
Pick a really big one.
They leave every evening.

37:18.333 --> 37:20.375
That's the one that goes to Paris.

37:25.958 --> 37:27.500
Good luck!

37:45.333 --> 37:46.958
What's wrong?

37:47.125 --> 37:48.958
I don't want to go in there.

37:49.083 --> 37:50.875
Why not? It's just noise.

37:50.958 --> 37:52.500
No, it's not just the noise.

37:54.292 --> 37:55.625
What do you want to do?

37:56.375 --> 37:57.958
I don't know.

38:00.333 --> 38:02.417
-What are you doing?
-I'm leaving.

38:03.125 --> 38:04.792
What are you going to do?

38:06.292 --> 38:07.833
Go back to the village?

38:08.500 --> 38:09.583
No.

40:02.917 --> 40:04.667
What's happening?

41:31.500 --> 41:33.375
Ali, I'm cold!

41:33.750 --> 41:35.583
Let's put on the clothes.

41:41.375 --> 41:42.833
Quick!

41:44.167 --> 41:45.875
Here, take it.

42:05.042 --> 42:06.958
I'm still cold.

42:10.792 --> 42:12.375
Don't worry, Adu.

42:23.333 --> 42:26.375
Let's sit together,
that will keep us warm.

42:46.792 --> 42:49.083
How long is the journey?

42:49.208 --> 42:50.375
Not long.

44:01.917 --> 44:03.083
Ali.

44:07.833 --> 44:09.875
Ali, wake up!

44:21.792 --> 44:23.625
Ali, wake up!

44:29.875 --> 44:32.875
Alika, wake up! Alika!

45:52.500 --> 45:54.833
Hey, what are you doing here?

45:55.958 --> 45:59.208
What are you doing here?
It's a forbidden zone.

46:00.625 --> 46:03.417
Don't you know you can't be here?

46:26.583 --> 46:28.125
I'm going to bed.

46:34.458 --> 46:36.083
What's wrong with you?

46:36.208 --> 46:37.333
What?

46:37.458 --> 46:40.667
-What the hell's that doing there?
-Dad, it's fake.

46:41.250 --> 46:42.833
It's plastic. From the party.

46:42.958 --> 46:44.083
What party?

46:44.208 --> 46:46.333
A party here in the hotel.

46:46.667 --> 46:48.542
You have to integrate, right?

46:50.042 --> 46:51.375
Are you on something?

46:52.125 --> 46:54.125
-What do you mean?
-Your eyes are red.

46:54.292 --> 46:55.958
I've been up all night.

46:56.833 --> 47:00.083
Sandra, do you know where you are?
Or why they gave you that?

47:00.208 --> 47:02.833
Yes, dad. I also know I'm an adult.

47:02.958 --> 47:05.125
If you were,
I wouldn't have to chase after you.

47:05.250 --> 47:08.042
Chase after me? Since when?
3 months, 6 months ago?

47:08.125 --> 47:10.583
-Since you lost the plot!
-Because everything was fine before?

47:11.958 --> 47:14.500
While you're with me you're not going
to behave like you did with your mother.

47:14.583 --> 47:17.083
How you know what I did with her?
You weren't there!

47:34.667 --> 47:36.083
Mateo...

47:36.958 --> 47:39.708
Hi. I'm Paloma, I'm a lawyer
with the Commission for Refugee Aid.

47:40.250 --> 47:42.250
-Sorry, not today.
-It's about the Tatou case.

47:42.375 --> 47:44.375
Can we talk for a second?

47:44.500 --> 47:47.792
-I've already made a...
-Just 5 minutes. It's very important.

47:51.458 --> 47:52.958
What a lovely view.

47:54.167 --> 47:55.750
It was my grandfather's flat.

47:56.458 --> 47:58.208
-Are you from Melilla?
-No.

47:58.792 --> 48:01.042
I was born in Madrid,
but I'm from a military family.

48:01.167 --> 48:02.542
-So am I.
-Really?

48:03.417 --> 48:05.292
I have many friends
in the Guardia Civil.

48:10.292 --> 48:13.917
Look, Mateo, I'm not here
to ruin anyone's career.

48:14.042 --> 48:16.208
I know you're under huge pressure.

48:16.333 --> 48:18.417
You said 5 minutes, didn't you?

48:20.958 --> 48:24.083
We've found the immigrants
who were with Tatou on the fence.

48:25.375 --> 48:28.792
They say you guys
hit him over the head with a baton.

48:30.375 --> 48:32.667
Did they say that
Tatou kicked my chief in the head

48:32.833 --> 48:34.042
and almost killed him?

48:34.167 --> 48:37.333
Are you saying your corporal
was justified in doing what he did?

48:37.958 --> 48:40.875
I'm not justifying anything. It's a fact.

48:40.958 --> 48:43.625
Tatou is dead, that's also a fact.

48:44.042 --> 48:46.458
You know they've started
throwing quicklime at us?

48:46.583 --> 48:48.750
Blood, faeces..

48:49.792 --> 48:52.125
Sometimes it's three of us
holding back 100.

48:52.208 --> 48:53.417
Of course I know that.

48:53.875 --> 48:56.917
Many of your fellow officers
have asked me to talk to the press.

48:57.042 --> 48:58.792
-And I've done it.
-No one cares.

48:58.917 --> 49:00.833
-The headline is Tatou.
-You're wrong.

49:00.958 --> 49:02.250
The headline isn't Tatou.

49:02.375 --> 49:04.833
The headline is that
those who should uphold the law

49:04.958 --> 49:06.125
ended up killing an immigrant.

49:06.250 --> 49:08.917
-We didn't kill anyone.
-Are you sure, Mateo?

49:20.083 --> 49:23.083
We're bringing Tatou's friends in
to make a statement.

49:23.208 --> 49:24.458
I've told the truth.

49:28.667 --> 49:29.583
Mateo...

49:30.792 --> 49:32.458
Ask yourself one question:

49:33.292 --> 49:34.833
Do you want it to happen again?

51:24.083 --> 51:25.417
How do you do that?

51:26.500 --> 51:28.500
How do you do that with the balls?

51:30.708 --> 51:31.792
Magic?

51:45.542 --> 51:46.500
Adu.

51:54.792 --> 51:55.875
Illegal?

52:13.667 --> 52:16.125
I came here in there.

52:16.250 --> 52:17.417
In the wheel.

52:27.458 --> 52:28.417
"Alone"?

52:28.542 --> 52:30.917
No, with my sister.

52:31.375 --> 52:32.833
Alika.

54:15.458 --> 54:16.667
Can you run?

54:58.500 --> 54:59.958
Come here.

56:26.667 --> 56:27.958
Carmen...

56:30.250 --> 56:31.542
-How are things?
-How are you?

56:31.667 --> 56:32.625
Good.

56:32.792 --> 56:34.208
This is my daughter, Sandra.

56:34.333 --> 56:35.333
Hi.

56:35.875 --> 56:36.875
Nice to meet you.

56:38.583 --> 56:39.833
Your dad talks a lot about you.

56:39.958 --> 56:40.875
Really?

56:40.958 --> 56:42.708
Yes, good things.

56:43.417 --> 56:45.083
Right, Carmen?

56:46.292 --> 56:48.208
I have things to do.
I'll be back in 2 hours.

56:48.333 --> 56:50.125
-You won't have a coffee?
-No, when I get back.

56:50.500 --> 56:53.625
You listen to Carmen.
She's the cleverest woman I know.

56:59.292 --> 57:01.625
Which arm will you do the jab in,
left or right?

57:02.167 --> 57:03.875
No, first we're going to talk.

57:04.542 --> 57:06.042
-OK.
-Would you like a coffee?

57:06.500 --> 57:09.208
-Shouldn't it be on an empty stomach?
-No, for this there's no need.

57:10.417 --> 57:12.625
So you're going to spend
some time with your dad.

57:13.417 --> 57:14.583
Until the summer.

57:15.167 --> 57:16.208
And what do you think?

57:16.333 --> 57:18.542
Of what, Africa or my dad?

57:20.542 --> 57:22.667
Look, I don't know
what he's told you but...

57:23.625 --> 57:25.750
I don't have a problem with drugs.

57:25.833 --> 57:26.708
No?

57:26.875 --> 57:27.875
No.

57:28.333 --> 57:30.000
There was an incident, but that's sorted.

57:31.125 --> 57:32.542
You almost ended up in jail.

57:33.958 --> 57:35.042
He said that?

57:37.042 --> 57:40.000
I've had cannabis and MDMA,
but they don't cause addiction.

57:40.250 --> 57:42.083
Well, you're a doctor,
you know that, right?

57:43.083 --> 57:44.292
And no cocaine?

57:46.125 --> 57:47.333
Are you two screwing?

57:48.167 --> 57:50.083
-What?
-Are you screwing?

57:50.167 --> 57:52.500
Just to get an idea
of when you talk about me.

57:54.167 --> 57:55.708
We had a relationship, yes.

57:56.125 --> 57:57.542
But that was some time ago.

57:57.667 --> 58:00.542
Jesus, I didn't know my dad
had been coming to Cameroon that long!

58:03.042 --> 58:05.417
You don't know much
about your dad, do you?

58:08.375 --> 58:11.458
You must be the one
who came after...

58:11.958 --> 58:14.167
Brigitte, right?

58:21.167 --> 58:24.458
He's so fucking great
at getting on with his exes.

58:25.583 --> 58:27.500
He gets on really fucking well
with my mum too.

58:27.958 --> 58:31.292
Even though he left her
when I was six.

58:33.125 --> 58:34.958
At first I didn't get it.
I was like, "Wow!

58:35.083 --> 58:38.458
What a talent for fucking up
and getting on well with his exes."

58:39.208 --> 58:42.333
He gets on with his exes
and with elephants.

58:45.958 --> 58:47.625
Your father is a good man, Sandra.

58:48.917 --> 58:50.292
My dad is so cynical.

58:51.125 --> 58:52.125
No.

58:53.667 --> 58:55.625
How much does he give this clinic?

58:55.708 --> 58:57.583
What's that got to do
with being cynical?

58:57.708 --> 59:00.458
You know he hasn't been to Spain
for 15 years

59:00.583 --> 59:01.917
because he has tax issues?

59:02.042 --> 59:06.083
If only all tax-avoiders spent
their money on humanitarian causes.

59:06.792 --> 59:08.125
Do you know what I think?

59:08.500 --> 59:10.125
He's good at buying things.

59:10.250 --> 59:12.333
-He's bought you all.
-Right...

59:13.042 --> 59:14.208
All except you.

59:15.083 --> 59:15.958
Yes.

59:16.083 --> 59:18.833
-Because you're smart.
-No, because I don't believe him.

59:20.125 --> 59:21.208
I see through him.

59:24.125 --> 59:26.292
-We're ready, now.
-Perfect.

59:26.958 --> 59:28.292
Shall we do the jab?

59:31.583 --> 59:33.750
I did a couple of lines
yesterday, OK?

59:35.042 --> 59:36.917
That's all I've taken
since I've been here.

01:00:50.167 --> 01:00:51.167
I don't have any.

01:01:04.542 --> 01:01:05.792
I'm hungry.

01:03:20.667 --> 01:03:21.667
Massar.

01:03:23.958 --> 01:03:25.083
Massar!

01:03:53.583 --> 01:03:55.042
How did you do it?

01:05:14.208 --> 01:05:15.875
Fucking thief!

01:05:15.958 --> 01:05:16.917
Let him go!

01:05:17.042 --> 01:05:19.375
Let him go, he's my friend!

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:22.917
Thief.

01:05:29.208 --> 01:05:30.333
Massar...

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.083
Massar, are you OK?

01:06:11.125 --> 01:06:12.958
<i>The far right has taken to the streets.</i>

01:06:13.125 --> 01:06:16.208
<i>Flemish extremists</i>
<i>outside the heart of the EU</i>

01:06:16.375 --> 01:06:19.292
<i>symbolically topple</i>
<i>the blue flag with the stars,</i>

01:06:19.417 --> 01:06:22.333
<i>that has guaranteed</i>
<i>the longest, most prosperous</i>

01:06:22.458 --> 01:06:24.333
<i>period of peace in our history.</i>

01:06:24.458 --> 01:06:27.083
<i>This time on the pretext</i>
<i>of the migration pact...</i>

01:06:27.208 --> 01:06:28.917
What if we say what happened?

01:06:31.708 --> 01:06:33.042
And what happened?

01:06:33.167 --> 01:06:35.292
We tried to get him off the fence
so his injuries didn't get worse,

01:06:35.375 --> 01:06:36.375
but he didn't let us.

01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:39.083
We can't start contradicting ourselves.

01:06:40.083 --> 01:06:41.958
We called for backup and none came.

01:06:42.125 --> 01:06:44.667
If we start slinging shit
they'll really go after us.

01:06:45.833 --> 01:06:46.833
So?

01:06:46.958 --> 01:06:47.875
So what?

01:06:48.375 --> 01:06:49.625
So nothing.

01:06:49.792 --> 01:06:51.292
Nothing happened, end of story.

01:06:51.792 --> 01:06:53.750
-They'll bring witnesses.
-Let them.

01:06:54.083 --> 01:06:56.500
They can say what they like,
their word against ours.

01:06:57.875 --> 01:06:58.833
What about the video?

01:06:59.458 --> 01:07:02.458
The video just shows
we tried to resuscitate him, that's all.

01:07:09.542 --> 01:07:11.125
Know what's going to screw us?

01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:13.625
Fear. Paranoia. Doubts.

01:07:15.083 --> 01:07:18.500
The magistrates are clever,
they'll try to provoke us.

01:07:20.167 --> 01:07:22.375
If we stand our ground,
there's no case to answer.

01:07:44.458 --> 01:07:45.542
Massar,

01:07:46.333 --> 01:07:47.542
what's that?

01:07:48.542 --> 01:07:50.125
Your back.

01:07:54.583 --> 01:07:55.708
The sun?

01:08:15.875 --> 01:08:17.957
You're not going to die, are you?

01:08:18.667 --> 01:08:19.957
No.

01:08:20.042 --> 01:08:22.292
Die? No.

01:08:22.417 --> 01:08:24.125
Do you promise?

01:08:25.957 --> 01:08:27.250
I promise.

01:09:06.957 --> 01:09:10.375
You know tax offences
expire after 10 years?

01:09:13.875 --> 01:09:15.375
I mention that because...

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:18.042
maybe we could go to Spain
instead of Morocco.

01:09:18.832 --> 01:09:20.707
I don't have any troubles in Spain.

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.625
Or in Cameroon,
and we had to get out fast.

01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:26.875
No, we didn't have to get out fast.

01:09:26.957 --> 01:09:30.292
I had a dispute with the directors
and I decided to walk away.

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:32.082
A dispute...

01:09:32.207 --> 01:09:33.875
-Right...
-Because of my temper.

01:09:34.292 --> 01:09:35.542
Which you've inherited.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.707
And which will cause you
a lot of problems.

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:40.707
That's why I want to help.

01:09:45.167 --> 01:09:48.207
For now, all you've done
is sell me a bike for 50 Euros.

01:09:49.375 --> 01:09:52.082
-It was a donation.
-Yeah, whatever you say.

01:09:54.792 --> 01:09:58.125
We're going to be living together
for a while, so let's try...

01:09:59.917 --> 01:10:00.917
I don't know...

01:10:01.042 --> 01:10:02.625
-Get along?
-Get along.

01:10:05.083 --> 01:10:06.458
As if we were friends?

01:10:08.125 --> 01:10:09.667
As if we were friends.

01:10:10.833 --> 01:10:11.875
OK.

01:10:45.458 --> 01:10:50.208
{\an8}AL HOCEIMA
NORTHERN MOROCCO

01:11:08.042 --> 01:11:09.333
Fuck...

01:11:11.083 --> 01:11:12.500
Nice pad.

01:11:13.083 --> 01:11:14.292
It's not bad.

01:11:20.583 --> 01:11:22.042
That one's Jerôme Neto.

01:11:22.125 --> 01:11:23.917
Killed in Ngorongoro, in Tanzania.

01:11:24.042 --> 01:11:27.500
The poacher who did it
had been paid $25 for the tusks.

01:11:32.667 --> 01:11:34.250
Yours is the first room, up the stairs.

01:11:34.375 --> 01:11:35.833
-You can unpack your bags.
-OK.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:37.167
Oh... Wait.

01:11:39.458 --> 01:11:40.958
That's a drug test.

01:11:41.042 --> 01:11:43.333
It contains urine test strips,
like the ones for diabetes.

01:11:44.583 --> 01:11:45.875
A test?

01:11:46.208 --> 01:11:48.292
Carmen recommended it.
No need for needles.

01:11:52.083 --> 01:11:53.958
Weren't we going to be friends?

01:11:54.875 --> 01:11:57.542
This is what friends do, they care.

01:12:02.208 --> 01:12:03.708
Every morning?

01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:24.708
Do you want a few coins?

01:13:25.083 --> 01:13:26.458
Money?

01:13:26.583 --> 01:13:28.375
Washing, over there.

01:13:29.917 --> 01:13:31.167
Money.

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:34.417
-Chocolate.
-Chocolate?

01:13:34.542 --> 01:13:36.458
Chocolate, food.

01:13:36.583 --> 01:13:38.458
-For you.
-For me?

01:13:43.042 --> 01:13:44.417
Leave that.

01:13:49.333 --> 01:13:50.833
Come on, get in.

01:13:53.042 --> 01:13:54.125
Get in.

01:13:54.542 --> 01:13:55.917
The magic?

01:13:56.292 --> 01:13:58.250
-What?
-The magic.

01:13:59.333 --> 01:14:00.667
Yes, magic.

01:14:04.833 --> 01:14:06.625
Come on, come on.

01:14:10.917 --> 01:14:11.875
Here.

01:14:31.708 --> 01:14:34.875
Is it good?
Do you want to play?

01:14:35.417 --> 01:14:36.917
Let's play.

01:14:37.167 --> 01:14:39.125
Let's play a bit.

01:14:39.583 --> 01:14:41.167
Do you like to play?

01:14:41.708 --> 01:14:43.125
Do you like to play?

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:46.750
What are you doing? Come here!

01:14:46.917 --> 01:14:47.875
Come here.

01:14:50.083 --> 01:14:52.208
What are you doing?

01:14:57.167 --> 01:14:58.458
Massar!

01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:05.167
Massar!

01:15:05.333 --> 01:15:06.833
Come, please!

01:15:27.542 --> 01:15:28.917
Massar, wait.

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:31.458
The money.

01:16:08.708 --> 01:16:10.125
Never again.

01:16:11.833 --> 01:16:13.458
But you do it.

01:16:17.542 --> 01:16:18.333
Why?

01:16:19.583 --> 01:16:20.958
You're a kid.

01:16:21.083 --> 01:16:22.875
I want to do magic.

01:16:43.375 --> 01:16:44.583
Why?

01:16:49.583 --> 01:16:51.250
What is "for pleasure"?

01:16:58.250 --> 01:16:59.125
Eat.

01:17:41.708 --> 01:17:43.417
Come on! Move!

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:46.208
-Come on!
-Hurry up, we're closing the border.

01:17:46.833 --> 01:17:48.667
Keep moving forward, please!

01:18:01.417 --> 01:18:02.833
Come on!

01:18:04.417 --> 01:18:06.583
Move! Move!

01:18:07.375 --> 01:18:08.708
Come on!

01:18:19.708 --> 01:18:21.458
Come on, don't stop.

01:18:56.125 --> 01:18:57.875
OVER 42 DEAD
IN DEMONSTRATION

01:18:57.958 --> 01:19:00.208
AGAINST CONGO'S
NEW ELECTORAL CENSUS

01:19:40.042 --> 01:19:42.042
Hey! Hey! What's going on?

01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:46.042
Go on, move it.

01:19:46.667 --> 01:19:48.208
Don't touch me!

01:19:49.458 --> 01:19:50.958
-Sandra...
-Leave me alone.

01:19:51.042 --> 01:19:53.167
Sandra, this place is full of dealers.

01:19:53.292 --> 01:19:54.750
I don't care!

01:19:54.917 --> 01:19:56.333
Are you playing the dumb tourist?

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:59.417
Dumb tourist?
All I was doing was dancing!

01:19:59.542 --> 01:20:01.083
No one comes here to dance.

01:20:01.208 --> 01:20:04.875
What do you care whether
I'm dancing, smoking or fucking?

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:06.625
What do you think?

01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:09.042
That all you have to do
to be a good father

01:20:09.125 --> 01:20:11.167
is pay for a lawyer
and make me pee on a strip?

01:20:13.125 --> 01:20:14.625
Get in the car. We're going home.

01:20:15.042 --> 01:20:16.417
That is not my home.

01:20:17.625 --> 01:20:18.917
Sandra...

01:21:10.208 --> 01:21:11.458
Morning.

01:21:11.583 --> 01:21:12.583
Morning.

01:21:15.042 --> 01:21:17.375
In a week's time, I have to go to Nador.

01:21:18.333 --> 01:21:19.667
For an interview.

01:21:20.958 --> 01:21:21.833
An interview?

01:21:22.958 --> 01:21:26.042
Yes, I might go to Mozambique
to work in a natural park.

01:21:27.375 --> 01:21:29.792
I'll leave you in Melilla
so you can fly to Madrid.

01:21:31.333 --> 01:21:33.458
I called your mother this morning
and told her.

01:21:37.042 --> 01:21:38.708
So that's it? It's that easy?

01:21:38.958 --> 01:21:40.167
You're right.

01:21:40.333 --> 01:21:41.667
You're an adult.

01:21:44.583 --> 01:21:45.958
And our relationship...

01:21:46.083 --> 01:21:48.292
can't be fixed with a lawyer
and some test strips.

01:21:48.875 --> 01:21:50.750
No, look. What I meant was...

01:21:50.917 --> 01:21:52.958
I know exactly what you meant.

01:21:53.792 --> 01:21:56.125
And you're probably right.

01:21:57.958 --> 01:21:59.417
But there's nothing more I can do.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:02.792
Or worse, I don't know how to do it.

01:22:09.208 --> 01:22:10.500
That's sad.

01:22:11.292 --> 01:22:12.583
Sad?

01:22:14.125 --> 01:22:15.542
That you don't know how to do more.

01:22:21.042 --> 01:22:23.042
I've tried, Sandra. Honestly.

01:22:25.208 --> 01:22:27.333
I've tried to get us
to accept each other.

01:22:27.458 --> 01:22:29.125
To get along like friends.

01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:30.833
But you're not my friend.

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:32.750
You're my dad.

01:23:02.667 --> 01:23:04.583
{\an8}PALACE OF JUSTICE
MELILLA

01:23:04.708 --> 01:23:06.542
{\an8}-Good morning.
-Good morning.

01:23:06.667 --> 01:23:08.042
{\an8}-Everything OK?
-Great.

01:23:08.167 --> 01:23:09.417
Let's go.

01:23:11.083 --> 01:23:12.875
We'll wait there until they call us.

01:23:18.042 --> 01:23:19.625
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:21.375
-How are things?
-Great.

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.250
-Have you been here a while?
-Not long.

01:23:23.375 --> 01:23:24.958
-Good morning.
-You're late.

01:23:25.083 --> 01:23:26.250
Yes.

01:23:26.375 --> 01:23:28.458
Well, we've got a delay.

01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:31.208
The case ahead of us is running late...

01:23:50.250 --> 01:23:52.958
{\an8}MOUNT GURUGÚ
NORTHERN MOROCCO

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:32.167
When do we go?

01:25:34.042 --> 01:25:35.375
We have to wait.

01:25:37.833 --> 01:25:39.125
No money.

01:29:16.958 --> 01:29:18.167
Are you OK?

01:29:19.583 --> 01:29:20.792
We have to go.

01:29:23.167 --> 01:29:25.250
We can't jump the fence.

01:29:28.208 --> 01:29:29.542
We're not going to jump.

01:29:53.042 --> 01:29:54.292
Dad...

01:29:55.833 --> 01:29:57.625
Why are you putting
the bags in the car?

01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:59.208
We set off first thing.

01:29:59.958 --> 01:30:02.292
But my washing things are in there.

01:30:03.208 --> 01:30:05.292
-I left them on the bed.
-Ah.

01:30:06.125 --> 01:30:07.208
OK.

01:33:33.833 --> 01:33:35.583
It's freezing!

01:34:23.667 --> 01:34:24.875
What?

01:34:24.958 --> 01:34:26.833
What did I tell you?

01:34:27.125 --> 01:34:28.958
-Say it.
-"No case to answer".

01:34:29.083 --> 01:34:30.958
No case to answer, Javi.

01:34:31.917 --> 01:34:33.667
Well, Mateo? What did I tell you?

01:34:33.833 --> 01:34:35.083
No case to answer!

01:34:36.167 --> 01:34:39.833
For the record, what happened
was a fucking tragedy.

01:34:40.417 --> 01:34:43.542
But I'd also like to say,
we've had a really bad time.

01:34:44.417 --> 01:34:45.875
Come on. To justice.

01:34:45.958 --> 01:34:47.583
-To justice!
-To Javi and Miguel!

01:34:47.708 --> 01:34:51.292
Although apparently justice
isn't enough for our superiors.

01:34:51.417 --> 01:34:52.708
They're posting me to Málaga.

01:34:52.875 --> 01:34:54.333
What the fuck! Get out of here!

01:34:54.458 --> 01:34:56.417
As if I was suspected of something.

01:34:56.542 --> 01:34:57.958
The fucking press, Miguel.

01:34:58.042 --> 01:35:00.208
Yes, the fucking press. But you know what?

01:35:00.333 --> 01:35:03.208
Fuck them. I'm happy, I'm satisfied,

01:35:03.333 --> 01:35:05.458
because Javi and Mateo are still here.

01:35:05.583 --> 01:35:07.375
So, a toast to you, partners.

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.625
-Damn right.
-Come on guys!

01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:12.083
-Heroes!
-Damn right.

01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:14.250
-What now?
-I'm going for a smoke.

01:35:39.875 --> 01:35:41.083
Got a rollie?

01:35:45.458 --> 01:35:46.667
There's some made up.

01:35:48.375 --> 01:35:49.583
Thanks.

01:35:52.833 --> 01:35:54.125
Not drinking?

01:35:55.917 --> 01:35:57.333
My shift starts at 10.

01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:05.625
He was a political prisoner.

01:36:05.958 --> 01:36:07.042
What?

01:36:08.417 --> 01:36:09.417
Tatou.

01:36:10.333 --> 01:36:12.250
He was a political prisoner in the Congo.

01:36:12.958 --> 01:36:15.958
Imprisoned for protesting
against an electoral census.

01:36:16.083 --> 01:36:17.417
Where did you see that?

01:36:18.958 --> 01:36:20.250
On the Internet.

01:36:21.042 --> 01:36:23.833
-Newspapers, blogs...
-You've been doing some research then?

01:36:26.917 --> 01:36:28.875
Do you know what the problem
with Africa is, Mateo?

01:36:29.708 --> 01:36:31.083
They all leave.

01:36:31.208 --> 01:36:33.833
Teachers, politicians, nurses...

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:35.917
And if they all leave,

01:36:36.042 --> 01:36:37.792
who the fuck is going to fix it?

01:36:41.542 --> 01:36:44.375
My granddad, who was a red,

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:47.833
always said if France had put up
a fence in the Pyrenees,

01:36:49.125 --> 01:36:50.792
Franco wouldn't have died
in his bed.

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:54.375
-That's different.
-No, my friend, that's no different.

01:36:55.958 --> 01:36:58.000
When the Africans see that fence,

01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:01.500
they think it says, "You're not welcome.

01:37:02.042 --> 01:37:04.167
This is forbidden territory for you."

01:37:08.083 --> 01:37:10.125
But do you know what it really means?

01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:11.708
What that fence really says?

01:37:12.375 --> 01:37:14.167
"Solve your own problems."

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:16.750
"Solve your own problems."

01:37:51.583 --> 01:37:53.333
Should we turn here?

01:37:53.458 --> 01:37:55.042
No, further out.

01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:58.708
My feet hurt.

01:37:59.167 --> 01:38:00.625
I'm cold.

01:38:36.042 --> 01:38:38.667
I'm here! Where are you?

01:38:47.375 --> 01:38:48.250
Here!

01:38:50.542 --> 01:38:52.417
I'm here, please!

01:38:53.958 --> 01:38:54.875
Massar.

01:38:55.917 --> 01:38:57.917
I'm here.

01:38:58.417 --> 01:39:00.292
Massar, where are you?

01:41:05.917 --> 01:41:07.250
He's alive!

01:41:11.375 --> 01:41:13.917
The jacket, where's the life jacket?

01:41:14.708 --> 01:41:16.167
Over there, at stern!

01:41:23.292 --> 01:41:25.083
Come here, little guy.

01:41:25.625 --> 01:41:27.667
-Can you lift him?
-Yes.

01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:30.417
-Come here.
-Mateo, come!

01:41:31.042 --> 01:41:32.292
Coming!

01:41:33.958 --> 01:41:36.667
There, you're OK.
You're doing fine, champ.

01:41:36.833 --> 01:41:38.208
Is this your friend?

01:41:38.417 --> 01:41:39.958
Adu, are you OK?

01:41:40.958 --> 01:41:42.500
We made it Adu!

01:41:42.625 --> 01:41:44.958
-I thought you had died!
-I'm not dead!

01:42:27.458 --> 01:42:29.167
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:32.083
Adu and Massar, right?

01:42:32.667 --> 01:42:34.042
Here, let's go.

01:42:37.417 --> 01:42:38.667
Good luck!

01:43:31.042 --> 01:43:33.125
Well, this is as far as I'm going.

01:43:36.875 --> 01:43:39.583
It would do you good
to spend some time in Spain.

01:43:40.625 --> 01:43:41.958
If you're asking...

01:43:42.542 --> 01:43:43.875
But you have to ask me.

01:43:59.333 --> 01:44:01.583
If you need something,
anything, call me.

01:44:02.167 --> 01:44:03.208
OK.

01:44:09.167 --> 01:44:10.375
Sandra...

01:44:15.958 --> 01:44:17.125
Call me.

01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:19.667
Yes.

01:44:20.042 --> 01:44:20.792
Sure.

01:44:51.583 --> 01:44:52.875
Can you come with me, please?

01:44:54.375 --> 01:44:55.667
Yes.

01:44:56.292 --> 01:44:57.250
Yes.

01:44:57.833 --> 01:44:58.750
Thanks.

01:45:13.708 --> 01:45:14.958
Is something wrong?

01:45:15.417 --> 01:45:17.542
You can leave the bags.
Over there, please.

01:45:22.542 --> 01:45:24.208
Where are you coming from?

01:45:24.875 --> 01:45:26.292
Near Tetuan.

01:45:28.917 --> 01:45:30.375
Did you buy the bike there?

01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:32.625
No, in Cameroon.
I was given it in Cameroon.

01:45:32.792 --> 01:45:33.958
Cameroon?

01:45:34.042 --> 01:45:35.375
Yes, I spent some time there.

01:45:36.208 --> 01:45:37.208
Alone?

01:45:38.042 --> 01:45:39.542
No, with my father.

01:46:06.167 --> 01:46:07.667
It's fake.

01:46:11.375 --> 01:46:15.500
I bought it at a market in Yaoundé,
there are tons on sale.

01:46:15.625 --> 01:46:16.917
I see...

01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:29.417
It must have fallen
out of my backpack...

01:46:41.417 --> 01:46:43.042
José.

01:47:23.458 --> 01:47:25.250
It's my dad's, he...

01:47:27.417 --> 01:47:29.208
He runs an elephant charity.

01:47:57.458 --> 01:47:58.542
Hello?

01:48:04.042 --> 01:48:05.583
Is everything OK?

01:48:10.792 --> 01:48:12.958
<i>Sandra, is everything OK?</i>

01:48:17.458 --> 01:48:18.958
Yes, yes.

01:48:21.667 --> 01:48:23.417
<i>Are you sure?</i>

01:48:27.833 --> 01:48:29.042
I'm sure.

01:48:32.042 --> 01:48:33.708
I'm glad to hear it.

01:49:35.667 --> 01:49:36.875
This is Massar.

01:49:42.375 --> 01:49:43.167
Get out of the car.

01:49:45.042 --> 01:49:46.417
What's the problem?

01:49:46.542 --> 01:49:48.458
What's going on?
Why have we stopped?

01:49:48.583 --> 01:49:49.833
Can't you hear me?

01:49:49.958 --> 01:49:51.833
I said get out of the car.

01:49:56.917 --> 01:49:58.083
You're staying here.

01:50:12.042 --> 01:50:13.917
Let me go! Let me go!
