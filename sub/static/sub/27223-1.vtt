- Not bad, guys.

02:08.542 --> 02:09.957
So, what do you think?

02:09.991 --> 02:12.649
- That's hot, and
we're hot playing it.

02:12.684 --> 02:14.858
- Just missing one thing.

02:14.893 --> 02:16.066
- I swear, it would
be easier for me

02:16.101 --> 02:18.068
to skin a cow and
make my own drum kit,

02:18.103 --> 02:22.072
than it would be to find a
decent girl drummer around here.

02:22.107 --> 02:24.696
- You wouldn't really skin
a cow, would you Pearl?

02:24.730 --> 02:27.423
- Hey, did ask at
the store downtown?

02:27.457 --> 02:30.080
- Only four girls
take lessons there.

02:30.115 --> 02:32.911
Two are just beginning,
one has a band already,

02:32.945 --> 02:34.464
and the last has
a dad that thinks

02:34.499 --> 02:37.087
rock is Satan's tool, so.

02:37.122 --> 02:40.608
- You know, it doesn't
have to be a girl.

02:40.643 --> 02:43.508
We could use a little
testosterone in here.

02:43.542 --> 02:45.268
- Yeah, Stef, I
know you'd love it

02:45.303 --> 02:48.237
if we stacked cute boys
along the back wall,

02:48.271 --> 02:51.412
but I really want my music to
be empowering to other girls.

02:51.447 --> 02:53.242
I've got seven months

02:53.276 --> 02:56.900
'til the Grammy Camp deadline
and a ton of cash to raise.

02:56.935 --> 02:59.627
- Don't worry, Pearl,
you'll make it.

02:59.662 --> 03:01.560
- The competition
is fierce, Kara.

03:01.595 --> 03:03.355
The top two campus
get to go on tour

03:03.390 --> 03:07.117
with Torno Pilots and
Luminous Hearts for two weeks.

03:07.152 --> 03:09.465
And I mean, I have no idea how

03:09.499 --> 03:11.984
I'm actually going
to raise this money.

03:12.019 --> 03:14.435
My dad said he'd cover
half, but who knows?

03:14.470 --> 03:16.713
- How much do you really need?

03:16.748 --> 03:21.753
- 5,000, less the 612 I've
raised over the past ten months.

03:22.616 --> 03:24.411
- That's like, what, four--

03:25.515 --> 03:27.552
- If we can find a
drummer, get a few gigs,

03:27.586 --> 03:29.312
my dad actually comes
through with this money--

03:29.347 --> 03:31.280
- Hey, chatting isn't
getting us anywhere.

03:31.314 --> 03:32.281
Let's play.

03:34.938 --> 03:38.252
- Uh, do you wanna start
at the top of her song?

03:41.462 --> 03:45.811
- And don't forget, Flossy
Frog is your friend, bye.

03:49.712 --> 03:51.265
Sugar?
- Mm?

03:51.300 --> 03:54.026
- I'm having trouble reading
on of your codes on this chart.

03:54.061 --> 03:55.407
- Which one?

03:55.442 --> 03:59.549
- Um, LB2, the second bicuspid,
DC1 descending canine,

03:59.584 --> 04:02.276
oh, here, what is the
one that looks like HDA?

04:02.311 --> 04:06.453
- Oh, that's a new code,
hot dad alert, mm-hmm.

04:06.487 --> 04:08.144
- Seriously?
- Yes, mm-hmm.

04:08.178 --> 04:10.111
- Mm-hmm?
- Oh, he's hot.

04:10.146 --> 04:11.941
- Look, I appreciated
the bad breath warning,

04:11.975 --> 04:15.703
but can you at least faint
a tiny bit of decorum?

04:15.738 --> 04:17.947
I didn't exactly hire
you for your name.

04:17.981 --> 04:19.430
- Oh, no.

04:19.466 --> 04:22.607
My mama gave me a perfectly
acceptable southern name,

04:22.641 --> 04:24.747
and it suits me to a T.

04:24.781 --> 04:27.336
Get it.

04:27.370 --> 04:29.510
- Okay, but a grown
woman named Sugar Cain

04:29.545 --> 04:32.962
in a dentist's office is a
bit ironic, don't you think?

04:32.996 --> 04:35.067
- I know your mama, mm-hmm.

04:35.102 --> 04:37.415
You're lucky she
had you 40 years ago

04:37.449 --> 04:38.933
'cause in her present state,

04:38.968 --> 04:41.971
she would have
named you Pop Song.

04:42.005 --> 04:43.421
- Ah, this morning she asked me

04:43.455 --> 04:47.045
to brush the back of her
hair with a remote control.

04:47.079 --> 04:48.564
- Bless her heart.

04:50.497 --> 04:54.294
- Yeah, well, anyway,
no more hot dad alerts.

04:55.433 --> 04:56.986
I'm in no position to
do anything about it

04:57.020 --> 04:58.401
even if they are single.

04:58.436 --> 04:59.678
- Hey, listen.

04:59.713 --> 05:01.749
You're too young and too pretty

05:01.784 --> 05:04.683
to waste away in the mom mobile
for the rest of your life.

05:04.718 --> 05:07.514
- You know, I like my
life, thank you very much.

05:07.548 --> 05:09.101
Anyway, keep the
codes tooth relevant.

05:09.136 --> 05:11.103
We do get audited, you know.

05:11.138 --> 05:13.451
- Dr. Song's dentist office.

05:15.832 --> 05:16.661
- Hi.

05:17.662 --> 05:18.663
- Hey.

05:20.147 --> 05:22.080
- I'm Dr. Song.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.185
- I'm Cole and this
is my daughter, Janis.

05:24.220 --> 05:26.222
- Nice to meet you, Janis.

05:26.256 --> 05:28.189
- Hi, I'm Janis.

05:28.224 --> 05:32.262
I was named after the famous
musician, Janis Joplin.

05:32.297 --> 05:34.368
- I love Janis Joplin.

05:34.403 --> 05:36.474
Let's take a look.

05:36.508 --> 05:39.718
- Um, Janis is a little
bit nervous about dentists.

05:39.753 --> 05:40.650
- Mm-hmm.

05:40.685 --> 05:41.858
- Ah, you got recommended

05:41.893 --> 05:43.515
on the deaf chat boards.

05:43.550 --> 05:45.206
How did you come to learn ASL?

05:45.241 --> 05:49.038
- Oh, my ex had a little
brother that was deaf.

05:49.072 --> 05:51.420
It's a comfort to some
of my younger patients.

05:51.454 --> 05:53.870
Don't talk to my 14 year
old daughter, though.

05:53.905 --> 05:56.701
She delights in the fact
that her favorite uncle,

05:56.735 --> 06:00.981
taught her all the bad
words in sign language.

06:01.015 --> 06:04.536
- Well, you, ah,
have a teenager?

06:04.571 --> 06:06.469
- Yes, indeed, in fact.

06:07.953 --> 06:11.163
Well, it looks like your dad
just earned a lollipop, too.

06:11.198 --> 06:12.510
- You have grape?

06:12.544 --> 06:13.787
- What kind of two-bit operation

06:13.821 --> 06:15.858
do you think we're running here?

06:15.892 --> 06:17.135
- I'm not sure.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.242
- Let's get to work.

06:21.277 --> 06:22.589
Open your mouth.

06:29.112 --> 06:31.460
You can sing a Janis Joplin song

06:31.494 --> 06:34.670
while we're doing
this, if you'd like.

06:36.119 --> 06:40.917
Mm-hmm, great teeth, who's
your dentist?

06:47.890 --> 06:51.583
Well, Janis, it looks
like you need a filling,

06:51.618 --> 06:54.103
but I have some giggle juice
that will fix you right up,

06:54.137 --> 06:55.553
and you won't feel a thing.

06:55.587 --> 06:58.935
Unless I lose control
of my tickle hand.

06:59.798 --> 07:01.800
Ah, I will be right back.

07:05.321 --> 07:06.702
- She seems nice.

07:10.844 --> 07:13.329
Tell me the truth, was it you?

07:13.363 --> 07:15.365
Did you eat the cookies?

07:16.781 --> 07:17.644
- I'm not scared, Daddy.

07:17.678 --> 07:19.197
She's really nice.

07:19.231 --> 07:22.372
- Yeah, sweetheart,
she is really nice.

07:22.407 --> 07:24.547
- And she has a daughter
about the same age as me,

07:24.582 --> 07:28.275
and her breath doesn't smell
like bologna like Dr. Dustbins.

07:28.309 --> 07:30.104
- His name is Dr. Dreslin,

07:30.139 --> 07:32.762
and no she doesn't
smell like bologna.

07:32.797 --> 07:33.936
- And she's single.

07:33.970 --> 07:35.731
Did you notice
that she has an ex?

07:35.765 --> 07:36.835
- And single.

07:36.870 --> 07:39.217
- She signs and she's smart.

07:40.598 --> 07:41.599
- I noticed.

07:42.531 --> 07:44.049
- She's really pretty.

07:44.084 --> 07:45.741
Did you notice that?

07:45.775 --> 07:50.504
- Yes, sweetheart, I think
Dr. Song is very smart.

07:50.539 --> 07:53.783
She's nice and she's
very, very pretty.

07:55.336 --> 07:57.787
And she's probably standing
right behind me right now.

07:57.822 --> 07:58.857
Isn't she?

07:58.892 --> 07:59.927
- Yes, daddy.

08:03.068 --> 08:08.073
- You think there's any chance
she didn't hear all that?

08:08.557 --> 08:09.178
- Nope.

08:09.868 --> 08:11.249
- Hmm.

08:11.283 --> 08:15.218
- Um, I'm sorry to interrupt
but I forgot to ask

08:16.599 --> 08:18.705
our patient if she prefers
bubblegum, peppermint

08:18.739 --> 08:20.430
or chocolate flavor.

08:21.604 --> 08:22.640
- I think our
little troublemaker

08:22.674 --> 08:25.090
would like chocolate.

08:25.125 --> 08:25.953
- Okay.

08:29.888 --> 08:30.889
- Way to go.

08:34.616 --> 08:36.308
- Mira, was I wrong?

08:37.206 --> 08:38.518
- Oh no.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.243
He's very attractive.

08:40.278 --> 08:41.486
- He's yummy.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.902
Did I mention he's a widower?

08:45.352 --> 08:47.561
- And where did you get
that piece of information?

08:47.596 --> 08:48.735
- Ooh let me talk--

08:48.769 --> 08:50.253
- I don't wanna know
what laws you've broken

08:50.288 --> 08:53.187
in the interest of
playing matchmaker.

08:53.222 --> 08:54.775
- Ooh, right there.

08:56.432 --> 08:57.260
- Oh, hey.

09:06.407 --> 09:07.374
- Bye, Dr. Song.

09:07.408 --> 09:09.272
- Yeah, thank you so much.

09:09.307 --> 09:10.480
I've never seen
my daughter smile

09:10.515 --> 09:12.828
leaving the dentist before.

09:12.862 --> 09:15.244
- Oh well she is a joy.

09:15.278 --> 09:17.384
And don't forget, Janis.

09:17.418 --> 09:19.904
Flossy frog is your boyfriend.

09:22.285 --> 09:23.459
I mean friend.

09:24.667 --> 09:26.842
He's not your
boyfriend, that's crazy.

09:26.876 --> 09:28.464
I don't know why I.

09:30.293 --> 09:32.848
Don't forget to floss.

09:32.882 --> 09:33.711
- Oh, bye.

09:37.438 --> 09:39.233
- You've been hitting
the novocaine, doc?

09:39.268 --> 09:40.476
'Cause you're
drooling a little bit

09:40.510 --> 09:41.615
like right there.

09:41.650 --> 09:42.547
What was that?

09:42.582 --> 09:45.170
- I don't know.

09:45.205 --> 09:46.033
- So um,

09:47.966 --> 09:52.177
I was thinking maybe we
could do coffee sometime?

09:52.212 --> 09:53.109
Or not, um.

09:54.559 --> 09:57.700
Yeah, you probably
get this all the time.

09:57.735 --> 10:00.772
Um, I'm sorry, I'm
not good at this.

10:00.807 --> 10:01.635
Bye.

10:02.774 --> 10:05.950
- I'd love to sometime
get coffee, sure.

10:07.261 --> 10:08.538
- Okay.

10:08.573 --> 10:09.401
- Okay.

10:11.265 --> 10:12.922
- Um, I'll call you.

10:16.857 --> 10:17.686
- Okay.

10:24.071 --> 10:26.833
Did I just agree to a date?

10:26.867 --> 10:29.387
- Well, it's hard to say since

10:30.595 --> 10:32.701
there really wasn't
a complete sentence

10:32.735 --> 10:34.668
in the entire exchange?

10:35.704 --> 10:37.567
- Why did I just say yes?

10:37.602 --> 10:39.949
- 'Cause he's hot and single.

10:39.984 --> 10:41.571
And you haven't gotten
any in three years,

10:41.606 --> 10:43.194
and roomie, I don't think
that's good for you.

10:43.228 --> 10:45.472
- Stop it, I have
a very full life.

10:45.506 --> 10:46.715
- Mhmm.

10:46.749 --> 10:48.302
- Very full, and it's
not going anywhere.

10:48.337 --> 10:51.133
But no one's gonna knowingly
take on my lovely baggage.

10:51.167 --> 10:53.514
- Who said anything
about luggage?

10:53.549 --> 10:54.930
It's just coffee.

10:56.621 --> 10:59.659
And then maybe some dessert
later, okay?

10:59.693 --> 11:01.626
- Okay, get out of here!

11:07.943 --> 11:09.427
So what do you do?

11:09.461 --> 11:10.877
- I um,

11:10.911 --> 11:14.018
- Dog manicurist with a little
brain surgery on the side?

11:14.052 --> 11:15.813
- Close, yeah.

11:15.847 --> 11:16.676
No.

11:17.953 --> 11:21.128
I uh, I opened up my own
gym about a year ago.

11:21.163 --> 11:24.442
And I used to be an MMA fighter.

11:24.476 --> 11:29.136
I decided to finally
pursue my dreams, I guess.

11:29.171 --> 11:31.242
- Good for you.

11:31.276 --> 11:33.037
Yeah that's brave,
with a kid too

11:33.071 --> 11:35.315
to take a chance like that.

11:35.349 --> 11:36.799
- Yeah.

11:36.834 --> 11:40.216
Sometimes stepping out of
that ring makes me feel old.

11:40.251 --> 11:44.082
But most of the time,
makes me feel younger.

11:44.117 --> 11:46.084
- It's kind of like parenting.

11:46.119 --> 11:47.741
- Yeah, but with
far less bruises

11:47.776 --> 11:49.605
and a lot less tears.

11:49.639 --> 11:51.089
- Which?

11:51.124 --> 11:52.470
Parenting or martial arts?

11:52.504 --> 11:53.471
- Parenting.

11:54.437 --> 11:55.438
- Super tough?

11:55.473 --> 11:56.923
- Mhmm.

11:56.957 --> 12:00.478
I haven't done this dating
thing in a long time.

12:00.512 --> 12:01.686
- Oh my.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.584
You thought this was a date?

12:03.619 --> 12:06.035
- Yeah, I mean I thought, um.

12:08.348 --> 12:09.763
- I'm kidding.

12:09.798 --> 12:12.766
No, I make stupid
jokes when I'm nervous.

12:12.801 --> 12:14.872
I haven't done this in
a long while either.

12:14.906 --> 12:16.943
- We'll get through it together.

12:16.977 --> 12:19.600
So, uh, I know you're a dentist

12:21.499 --> 12:25.883
unless that's just a
front for your real gig,

12:25.917 --> 12:29.783
touring ventriloquist
act with Flossy the frog.

12:29.818 --> 12:32.855
- Busted.

12:36.445 --> 12:38.067
- Oh, come on old man.

12:38.102 --> 12:40.138
You're gonna have to lay
off the kid's happy meals

12:40.173 --> 12:41.899
if you wanna keep up.

12:43.383 --> 12:44.591
- I've flattened out
punks bigger than you

12:44.625 --> 12:46.351
long before you had
your first burger.

12:46.386 --> 12:48.698
- You know when you tell
me how old you, are,

12:48.733 --> 12:50.321
not just napkins come back.

12:50.355 --> 12:51.943
- True.

12:51.978 --> 12:54.808
So did I tell you I went
on a date last night?

12:54.843 --> 12:55.636
- Date?

12:57.984 --> 12:58.778
Mmm.

12:59.951 --> 13:01.401
You know what, I might
be a little punch drunk

13:01.435 --> 13:03.644
from that kick, but I
thought you said something

13:03.679 --> 13:05.163
about a date.

13:05.198 --> 13:06.544
- Yeah, you did.

13:08.822 --> 13:09.961
- Wow, really?

13:11.480 --> 13:12.308
All right.

13:13.654 --> 13:15.070
So you're telling me
that after all this time

13:15.104 --> 13:16.588
that I've been trying
to help you out,

13:16.623 --> 13:18.073
help you get hooked up,

13:18.107 --> 13:19.488
you figured it out for yourself?

13:19.522 --> 13:20.834
- Yeah.

13:20.869 --> 13:22.836
- That's awesome, man.

13:22.871 --> 13:24.769
Okay, well don't hold out on me.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.083
Give me the deets,
what's going on?

13:28.117 --> 13:30.982
- I met her when I took
Janis to the dentist.

13:31.017 --> 13:34.365
- Oh, picking up ladies
in the waiting room.

13:34.399 --> 13:36.574
That is some advanced stuff.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.508
- No, she actually
was the dentist.

13:39.542 --> 13:40.647
- Pff, even better.

13:40.681 --> 13:42.269
Picking up doctors, that's dope.

13:42.304 --> 13:43.132
Congrats.

13:44.064 --> 13:45.617
All right, well.

13:45.652 --> 13:47.861
Million dollar question.

13:47.896 --> 13:48.862
Does she know?

13:48.897 --> 13:49.863
- Oh no, no.

13:51.002 --> 13:51.900
Way too early.

13:51.934 --> 13:53.142
I mean I know it's impossible

13:53.177 --> 13:55.248
but it's nice to
sit down and talk

13:55.282 --> 13:56.456
to a grownup for a change.

13:56.490 --> 13:57.906
- Dude.

13:57.940 --> 14:01.012
- No, no, someone not
trying to punch my face in.

14:01.047 --> 14:02.531
- Oh, well you know what,

14:02.565 --> 14:05.085
she's a woman, give her time.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.707
Oh, all right well,

14:08.364 --> 14:09.331
tell me more about her.

14:09.365 --> 14:10.332
What is she like?

14:10.366 --> 14:11.574
Is she hot?

14:11.609 --> 14:13.024
How old is she?

14:13.059 --> 14:14.854
More importantly, does she
have a gullible younger sister

14:14.888 --> 14:16.096
that I can you know?

14:16.131 --> 14:17.235
- She's gorgeous.

14:17.270 --> 14:20.549
And, uh, forty-ish I'd say.

14:22.654 --> 14:25.278
Smarter than me, like Sarah.

14:25.312 --> 14:26.796
- Well to your
credit, you have taken

14:26.831 --> 14:29.351
a few more shots to the head.

14:31.525 --> 14:34.045
So, when's the next date?

14:34.080 --> 14:35.426
- I don't know.

14:35.460 --> 14:36.772
How long are you
supposed to wait anyways?

14:36.806 --> 14:38.705
- My man, you've come
to the right place

14:38.739 --> 14:40.327
for advice about the
ladies, all right?

14:40.362 --> 14:43.365
Okay, first things
first, all right?

14:44.780 --> 14:46.816
You gotta stop being so nice
all the time, all right?

14:46.851 --> 14:48.473
Dude like I get it, that's
probably your character.

14:48.508 --> 14:50.441
It's lovely, but women like guys

14:50.475 --> 14:52.615
who have a little bit
more mystery going on,

14:52.650 --> 14:54.100
little more edge.

14:54.134 --> 14:56.826
All right, stop with the
nice guy stuff, all right?

14:56.861 --> 14:58.035
- Okay.

14:58.069 --> 14:59.864
I mean I've been out of
the game for a minute

14:59.899 --> 15:02.694
but I think women
like nice still.

15:04.075 --> 15:06.353
And I'm pretty sure they don't
like being called chicks.

15:06.388 --> 15:07.872
- Whatever man, okay?

15:07.907 --> 15:11.393
It's just, number two is
your wardrobe, all right?

15:11.427 --> 15:13.050
First of all, pick
something that looks like

15:13.084 --> 15:14.430
it came from this decade.

15:14.465 --> 15:16.916
Second of all, show
off those guns, dude.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.021
Women love muscles, all right.

15:19.056 --> 15:20.574
You know, show off
the six pack, or.

15:22.162 --> 15:23.163
All right, my bad.

15:23.198 --> 15:24.164
But you know what I'm saying.

15:24.199 --> 15:25.683
Just bring her to the gym.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.374
She'll love that, seeing you
flex and fight and stuff.

15:27.409 --> 15:28.962
- Here's what I think.

15:28.997 --> 15:30.999
I think your advice
is about as on point

15:31.033 --> 15:33.656
as your head kick and
your sparring game.

15:33.691 --> 15:35.520
So I say we get back
to working on that.

15:35.555 --> 15:36.383
- Right.

15:39.628 --> 15:43.183
- So there was all this
excitement and then

15:44.357 --> 15:46.911
nine years later,
it was all gone.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.086
Hollywood stopped calling.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.880
Grandma got sick.

15:50.915 --> 15:53.055
We moved back to Michigan.

15:55.023 --> 15:56.300
Dad tried to revive his career

15:56.334 --> 15:59.406
but mom didn't wanna
move back to LA.

16:01.029 --> 16:04.101
Eventually she just
moved to Sweden.

16:04.135 --> 16:06.103
- Oh my gosh,
that's unbelievable.

16:06.137 --> 16:07.897
- Can't make this stuff up.

16:07.932 --> 16:09.382
- But Mr. Bunsen is your dad?

16:09.416 --> 16:10.935
- Yeah.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.730
- TV's most lovable
science teacher?

16:12.764 --> 16:13.593
- Right.

16:14.663 --> 16:16.630
- God, my, hah.

16:16.665 --> 16:19.633
My brother in law Adam was
obsessed with scientific method.

16:19.668 --> 16:23.016
He used to beg us to watch
it with him every Saturday.

16:23.051 --> 16:27.296
- It's crazy, those episodes
still air 30 years later.

16:27.331 --> 16:28.953
Dad can't even walk
down the street

16:28.988 --> 16:32.819
without getting mugged for
pictures and autographs.

16:32.853 --> 16:36.098
But to tell you the
truth, he loves it.

16:37.306 --> 16:40.551
- I mean, that must
have been a shadow.

16:40.585 --> 16:42.794
I mean to a kid like Adam,

16:42.829 --> 16:44.555
your dad was like
this perfect adult

16:44.589 --> 16:46.419
with all the answers.

16:46.453 --> 16:48.766
Always there for
those misfit kids.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.458
But in reality it must have
been hard to share your dad.

16:51.493 --> 16:53.840
- It's funny, most
people don't get that.

16:53.874 --> 16:56.153
Like yeah, when we
moved back to Michigan,

16:56.187 --> 17:00.260
being Sam Bennett's son was
a reason to get picked on.

17:00.295 --> 17:03.677
They used to call me Hollyweird.

17:03.712 --> 17:05.679
But that's what got
me into martial arts,

17:05.714 --> 17:07.715
to stand up for myself.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.787
- It's a wonder why
I became a dentist.

17:13.342 --> 17:15.068
- Oh, that was good.

17:15.103 --> 17:16.173
- It was fast.

17:16.207 --> 17:17.553
- I know.

17:19.866 --> 17:22.558
- You talking
about the fighting,

17:22.593 --> 17:25.215
it's funny how those certain
moments in your childhood

17:25.251 --> 17:26.665
change your path.

17:29.013 --> 17:32.120
- So you became a dentist
to extract the teeth

17:32.154 --> 17:33.500
of your enemies?

17:34.639 --> 17:37.573
- Well, yeah, yeah of course.

17:37.608 --> 17:39.161
But no, no, I mean.

17:40.507 --> 17:43.890
That 1983 blizzard when
everything closed down

17:43.924 --> 17:44.822
for a week?

17:46.444 --> 17:48.826
My dad started reading
Pearl S. Buck's "Good Earth"

17:48.860 --> 17:50.724
aloud by the fire.

17:50.759 --> 17:52.209
And the lights and
the heat came back on

17:52.243 --> 17:54.073
but we were so into it

17:55.281 --> 17:57.145
we spent every night after that

17:57.179 --> 17:59.768
huddled around the
candle, listening.

17:59.802 --> 18:01.632
- That's a really
beautiful memory.

18:01.666 --> 18:03.116
- Yeah.

18:03.151 --> 18:06.015
And in hindsight, it
explains my fascination

18:06.050 --> 18:07.879
with Asia and other cultures.

18:07.914 --> 18:10.330
It was like, it was
this whole other world

18:10.365 --> 18:12.608
no one knew anything about.

18:13.644 --> 18:16.405
Now I have a
daughter named Pearl.

18:17.268 --> 18:18.545
Did I tell you she's from China?

18:18.580 --> 18:19.408
- Uh, no.

18:22.031 --> 18:25.034
Did I tell you Janis is adopted?

18:25.069 --> 18:27.140
- Oh, that's fantastic.

18:27.175 --> 18:28.348
- Yeah.

18:28.383 --> 18:31.006
- It's the best
thing I ever did.

18:31.903 --> 18:32.732
- Kids.

18:33.698 --> 18:34.527
- Kids.

18:39.394 --> 18:40.671
Oh, I gotta go.

18:41.534 --> 18:43.467
My kid's swim party just ended.

18:43.501 --> 18:44.882
- Okay.

18:44.916 --> 18:47.264
Um, we should do this again.

18:47.298 --> 18:48.644
- I'd like that.

18:50.750 --> 18:51.544
All right, bye.

18:51.578 --> 18:52.407
- Bye.

18:56.894 --> 18:57.722
Oh gosh.

19:12.979 --> 19:14.394
Did you really think
I was gonna answer

19:14.429 --> 19:17.501
any of your seven texts
while I'm on a date?

19:17.535 --> 19:19.537
- Hey, I am like
Dr. Frankenstein

19:19.572 --> 19:21.470
and you are my creation!

19:21.505 --> 19:24.163
- So it went really really well.

19:25.716 --> 19:28.201
But um, I gotta tell her soon.

19:29.513 --> 19:32.861
- Oh, no no no,
too soon, too soon.

19:32.895 --> 19:35.726
- Yeah but it's not fair.

19:35.760 --> 19:36.899
I feel like I'm lying.

19:36.934 --> 19:39.108
She left her phone behind.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.940
- Oh no, no that's good.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.183
I know that trick.

19:44.217 --> 19:45.736
That's the whole leave
something behind trick.

19:45.770 --> 19:46.978
She has to see you now.

19:47.013 --> 19:48.635
- Yeah, no, but she
said she was gonna go

19:48.670 --> 19:49.947
pick up her kid.

19:49.981 --> 19:52.536
And this is from
some dude named Paulo

19:52.570 --> 19:56.160
saying, "Are you
coming, I'm ready now."

19:56.195 --> 19:58.093
So here I am worried
about whether or not

19:58.127 --> 19:59.301
I'm telling her the truth

19:59.336 --> 20:01.959
and she's running off to
meet some latin lover.

20:01.993 --> 20:03.685
- Dude, harsh.

20:03.719 --> 20:06.274
- Yeah well, so
much for re-entering

20:06.308 --> 20:07.758
the dating scene.

20:28.157 --> 20:29.504
- This is
obnoxious, dude,

20:29.538 --> 20:31.713
you can't like, seriously?

20:32.645 --> 20:34.163
- Ah, hi, is this?

20:35.648 --> 20:37.443
- Okay, you need to chill
about this boy, all right?

20:37.477 --> 20:39.203
You've been single
for what, three days?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.273
Hold, please.

20:41.481 --> 20:43.034
Stranger danger.

20:43.069 --> 20:44.967
There's this random
dude at the door.

20:45.002 --> 20:48.281
I don't know, he's kind
of cute for an old dude.

20:48.316 --> 20:49.903
Screenshot this old
geezer in case he's here

20:49.938 --> 20:51.974
under nefarious purposes.

20:52.009 --> 20:54.080
I gotta go, right, later.

20:55.184 --> 20:58.049
- Um, so, I'm pretty sure this,

20:58.084 --> 20:59.879
- Oh, that voice.

20:59.913 --> 21:02.019
Who's the old dude?

21:02.053 --> 21:03.986
Are you really getting
desperate enough

21:04.021 --> 21:08.439
to open your dating
pool to senior citizens?

21:08.474 --> 21:09.302
Smart.

21:11.062 --> 21:13.202
- I'm pretty sure I have
the right house, and your--

21:17.345 --> 21:18.898
- Toni said she was
gonna cut off my hair

21:18.932 --> 21:20.658
and make a throw rug out of it.

21:20.693 --> 21:22.142
I like my hair and I don't think

21:22.177 --> 21:23.765
it would make a very good rug.

21:23.799 --> 21:25.629
- I wasn't actually
going to do it.

21:25.663 --> 21:27.113
It was just a
science experiment.

21:27.147 --> 21:28.597
- Toni, what science
experiment would involve you

21:28.632 --> 21:30.841
threatening your sister
with household utensils?

21:30.875 --> 21:32.636
- We're studying bees.

21:32.670 --> 21:34.879
Bees teach us a valuable lesson.

21:34.914 --> 21:36.156
You might be small.

21:36.191 --> 21:38.780
You might be tiny in a
world full of giants.

21:38.814 --> 21:40.195
- Yes?

21:40.229 --> 21:41.817
- When you're chasing
somebody with a sharp object,

21:41.852 --> 21:43.681
people will still run away.

21:43.716 --> 21:45.752
- You guys, I'm trying
to get the baby down.

21:45.787 --> 21:47.651
- I'm not a baby, Emmy.

21:47.685 --> 21:50.205
- I know Theodore,
you're a big boy.

21:50.239 --> 21:52.414
- Sorry, Em, I'll
get things sorted.

21:52.449 --> 21:53.829
Night night Theo.

21:53.864 --> 21:56.453
- Night night, don't
let the dead buds bite.

21:56.487 --> 21:59.732
- That's bedbugs
Theo, not dead bugs.

21:59.766 --> 22:02.044
- If there were dead bugs,
they couldn't even bite.

22:02.079 --> 22:03.977
- There is live bugs in the bed?

22:04.012 --> 22:05.979
- No, baby, it's an expression.

22:06.014 --> 22:08.361
Oh, I'm not a baby, Emmy.

22:08.396 --> 22:10.225
- I know Theo, I know.

22:11.571 --> 22:13.884
- Has somebody fed the cat?

22:13.918 --> 22:16.231
- Grandma, we don't have a cat.

22:16.265 --> 22:17.681
- Oh, did he die?

22:18.716 --> 22:20.718
Why wasn't I told?

22:20.753 --> 22:23.894
- No, we never had
a cat, grandma.

22:23.928 --> 22:25.999
- Oh well, good.

22:26.034 --> 22:28.347
They're insufferable beasts.

22:34.939 --> 22:38.287
- Uh, so I'm pretty sure
this is the right house.

22:38.322 --> 22:43.154
You're Pearl, and this is
Susan Song's house, right?

22:43.189 --> 22:45.018
- Yeah, maybe.

22:45.053 --> 22:46.641
Who are you?

22:46.675 --> 22:47.504
- Cole?

22:52.163 --> 22:54.131
What are you doing here?

22:55.235 --> 22:56.029
- Um, hi.

22:58.031 --> 22:59.481
- Who's that, mom?

23:00.586 --> 23:03.036
- Give mommy a moment, Paulo.

23:04.210 --> 23:06.385
Go change into some
dry PJs, okay sweety?

23:06.419 --> 23:10.906
- Yo campers, what's
everybody doing out here?

23:10.941 --> 23:13.046
- Paulo was your son?

23:13.081 --> 23:14.738
- Yes, I'm sorry, I,

23:15.842 --> 23:17.396
why are you here?

23:17.430 --> 23:19.190
How did you find our house?

23:19.225 --> 23:21.883
- You left your phone behind and

23:23.436 --> 23:27.785
you told me about your
sub and the buddha statue.

23:27.820 --> 23:29.994
I'm still confused.

23:30.029 --> 23:32.134
- Kids, please go inside.

23:33.342 --> 23:36.691
Mommy needs to have a
chat with Mr. Bennett.

23:38.037 --> 23:38.865
- Mom?

23:39.970 --> 23:41.212
How many of them are yours?

23:41.247 --> 23:42.421
- All of them.

23:47.046 --> 23:49.876
I didn't think you
would consider,

23:53.949 --> 23:54.778
I'm sorry.

23:58.540 --> 24:01.578
I understand if you wanna run.

24:01.612 --> 24:05.098
I don't blame you,
I know it's crazy.

24:05.133 --> 24:09.068
No one in this day and
age has seven kids.

24:09.102 --> 24:11.070
- Well that's a lot.

24:11.104 --> 24:13.279
- But they're all perfect.

24:15.143 --> 24:16.800
And this is my life.

24:17.904 --> 24:20.493
I know I should have told you

24:20.528 --> 24:21.667
but I just, I,

24:22.840 --> 24:25.947
I haven't met anybody
in the past three years

24:25.981 --> 24:28.328
that made me feel beautiful.

24:29.951 --> 24:30.779
Or funny.

24:32.022 --> 24:33.610
And you're perfect.

24:34.783 --> 24:37.717
But I know, I know
this is impossible.

24:39.547 --> 24:41.272
Why are you laughing?

24:46.795 --> 24:50.316
This is a picture of your
youth class at the gym?

24:50.350 --> 24:53.284
Are you offering
us a package deal?

24:54.527 --> 24:56.667
'Cause I don't
think that's funny

24:56.702 --> 24:59.325
or very appropriate right now.

24:59.359 --> 25:00.568
I know I should have told you,

25:00.602 --> 25:03.605
I probably deserve
to be mocked, but,

25:04.744 --> 25:05.573
oh.

25:09.853 --> 25:11.302
Oh, god, is that?

25:16.376 --> 25:17.481
That's Janis.

25:18.309 --> 25:19.138
- Yeah.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.591
Look, I didn't know
how to tell you.

25:23.625 --> 25:26.145
I thought you'd just run away.

25:27.249 --> 25:28.906
- They're all yours?

25:30.114 --> 25:30.943
Seven?

25:44.577 --> 25:46.717
I guess we're both crazy.

25:46.752 --> 25:47.925
- Certifiably.

25:52.205 --> 25:54.622
You know what's even crazier?

25:55.623 --> 25:56.485
- What?

26:13.502 --> 26:15.332
Cole, I can't do this.

26:16.747 --> 26:19.647
I mean, it's lovely,
you're lovely,

26:21.200 --> 26:22.442
but, seriously.

26:25.445 --> 26:26.964
- I know it's only
been two weeks

26:26.999 --> 26:28.483
but I think I'm falling in,

26:28.517 --> 26:30.347
- No, no, no.

26:30.381 --> 26:31.866
Don't finish that.

26:33.177 --> 26:35.283
We have a lot in common.

26:35.317 --> 26:37.803
Granted a lot more than
we both bargained for

26:37.837 --> 26:41.323
but we're adults with
responsibilities,

26:41.358 --> 26:43.118
a lot of responsibilities.

26:43.153 --> 26:44.637
- Yeah, but we're
human beings too.

26:44.672 --> 26:48.020
- I have a house
full of human beings

26:48.054 --> 26:51.161
whose dad left
because I think I can,

26:53.922 --> 26:56.994
I think I can take
care of the world.

27:00.273 --> 27:05.002
I can't just waltz another
man in and out of their lives.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.351
Thank you for a
lovely couple of weeks

27:09.386 --> 27:11.768
but I can't, I can't do this.

27:42.246 --> 27:43.075
- So, um,

27:44.628 --> 27:45.767
you're dating.

27:48.736 --> 27:49.598
- Yeah.

27:51.152 --> 27:54.189
I mean, no, oh god, it was just,

27:54.224 --> 27:55.950
it's just a few dates.

27:55.984 --> 27:57.986
Anyway, I just ended it.

28:00.195 --> 28:03.198
- That didn't look
like a goodbye.

28:03.233 --> 28:05.511
- Well, why, because of us?

28:10.171 --> 28:11.690
- Yeah, partially.

28:12.656 --> 28:15.141
You guys are my world.

28:15.176 --> 28:18.248
- You know you're entitled to
a world outside of us, right?

28:18.282 --> 28:20.353
- Wait, you're okay with this?

28:20.388 --> 28:22.666
- Yeah, you're not?

28:23.978 --> 28:26.083
- Well, I don't
know, it's just a lot

28:26.118 --> 28:27.982
to take in, I guess.

28:28.016 --> 28:32.814
I mean, I'm almost 15 and
my mom's been on more dates

28:32.849 --> 28:36.438
this year than I've
had my entire life, so.

28:37.612 --> 28:38.993
- Well I ended it.

28:39.027 --> 28:41.133
It's complicated.

28:41.167 --> 28:43.445
- Well isn't it always
when it involved boys?

28:43.480 --> 28:44.964
- What would you
know, small bean?

28:44.999 --> 28:47.518
- I live on planet
earth, bean pole.

28:50.901 --> 28:52.800
- So, what's the scoop?

28:55.078 --> 28:56.148
- Oh, ladies.

28:57.114 --> 28:57.943
Buckle up.

28:59.116 --> 29:02.154
I think this is going to
require some ice cream

29:02.188 --> 29:03.638
and a pajama dance party

29:03.672 --> 29:08.677
and some, oh too bad you
girls are too young for wine.

29:09.126 --> 29:10.300
- A sip?

29:10.334 --> 29:11.163
- No.

29:14.166 --> 29:15.857
- Whatever.

29:16.755 --> 29:17.548
- One one two.

29:17.583 --> 29:18.480
One two three.

29:18.515 --> 29:19.792
There you go.

29:19.827 --> 29:21.138
That's some good work.

29:21.173 --> 29:23.175
- All right man, see you later.

29:23.209 --> 29:24.383
- Hey.

29:24.417 --> 29:25.936
- Thanks for taking
the kids out to dinner.

29:25.971 --> 29:28.007
- Son, you don't have to
thank me for spending time

29:28.042 --> 29:30.320
with the best grandkids
on the planet.

29:30.354 --> 29:32.253
They were like wild
animals though.

29:32.287 --> 29:34.876
Fortunately I've got a
degree in lion taming.

29:34.911 --> 29:37.051
- G- Pa, I was a
good girl, was I?

29:37.085 --> 29:38.673
- You were an angel, sunshine.

29:38.707 --> 29:40.123
- What about me?

29:40.157 --> 29:42.677
- You were a dream, Peanut.

29:42.711 --> 29:44.921
- You guys know he only
calls us by these nicknames

29:44.955 --> 29:47.578
because he can't keep
our real names straight?

29:47.613 --> 29:49.166
- That is possible.

29:50.133 --> 29:51.893
Inga, Erma, Gertrude.

29:53.239 --> 29:54.551
What are your names again?

29:56.346 --> 30:00.971
- I just, I worked so hard I
burned off half of my dinner.

30:01.006 --> 30:03.111
- How was first day
of second grade?

30:03.146 --> 30:04.250
- A hot mess.

30:05.734 --> 30:08.289
- Hey, but you tried.

30:08.323 --> 30:09.531
How you all doing?

30:09.566 --> 30:11.637
How's my favorite
bunch of savages, huh?

30:11.671 --> 30:12.914
- Excellent, Christopher.

30:12.949 --> 30:14.467
I'm president of the
mathematathlon team

30:14.502 --> 30:16.745
and treasurer of the
junior chemists this year.

30:16.780 --> 30:18.782
- Wow, that's ambitious.

30:20.508 --> 30:21.958
- What's going on, Toph?

30:21.992 --> 30:23.891
- Hey man, you know me,
just punching and posing.

30:23.925 --> 30:27.653
So how does everyone feel
about the old man dating?

30:27.687 --> 30:30.621
- Um, they, they
didn't know about it

30:30.656 --> 30:33.038
till just now, thanks.

30:33.072 --> 30:34.902
But it's over anyways.

30:36.351 --> 30:38.802
- Actually, I was having
an interesting conversation

30:38.837 --> 30:41.701
with Janis about the
very thing at dinner.

30:41.736 --> 30:42.702
- Oh yeah?

30:42.737 --> 30:43.945
- Yeah really.

30:43.980 --> 30:45.429
She said you asked
out her dentist

30:45.464 --> 30:47.673
and you were stuttering
the whole time

30:47.707 --> 30:48.916
- Really dad?

30:48.950 --> 30:50.745
You used to do that
with mom all the time,

30:50.779 --> 30:51.988
remember that, guys?

30:52.022 --> 30:55.646
- Yeah, and where do you
think I got that from?

30:56.889 --> 30:58.891
Listen, let's not make
a big deal out of it.

30:58.926 --> 31:01.100
I mean she was amazing,

31:01.135 --> 31:04.690
but it's over and I don't
have the time for this anyway

31:04.724 --> 31:09.177
so I have my tribe to tame
and I have the gym to run.

31:09.212 --> 31:11.110
- Chris, you got a sec?

31:12.111 --> 31:14.631
Kids, would you go with Chris?

31:16.150 --> 31:16.978
Son.

31:19.222 --> 31:21.914
Sarah left you with
a big responsibility

31:21.949 --> 31:25.504
and clear instructions
to be happy.

31:25.538 --> 31:28.369
- Yeah, but she dumped me.

31:28.403 --> 31:30.371
I mean, kind of.

31:30.405 --> 31:31.993
It's complicated.

31:32.028 --> 31:34.340
- Women are complicated.

31:34.375 --> 31:37.447
Life is always
complicated with women.

31:37.481 --> 31:40.208
But there is life after Sarah.

31:40.243 --> 31:42.831
- Sarah and I were
once in a lifetime.

31:42.866 --> 31:45.006
Besides, I'm not lonely.

31:45.041 --> 31:46.697
- Really?

31:46.732 --> 31:50.909
I saw the way you looked when
you were talking about her.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.151
Find her.

31:52.186 --> 31:53.221
Tell her.

31:53.256 --> 31:55.465
Or you'll regret it, son.

31:55.499 --> 31:57.881
The things we leave
unsaid will tell volumes

31:57.916 --> 31:59.262
about the future.

32:01.505 --> 32:04.923
- Did I tell you
she has seven kids?

32:04.957 --> 32:08.512
- Seven, 14, who cares,
you're a great dad!

32:11.308 --> 32:15.071
Besides, these kids
deserve to see you happy.

32:16.900 --> 32:18.557
- You're right, dad.

32:21.525 --> 32:22.492
- 14?

32:22.526 --> 32:23.355
- 14.

32:25.874 --> 32:27.876
- Here, I've got a plan.

32:29.775 --> 32:31.087
Okay.

32:31.121 --> 32:32.571
You wanna count one more.

32:32.605 --> 32:34.090
Wait, what's it say?

32:34.124 --> 32:36.368
- The strange loping creatures
who had found their way

32:36.402 --> 32:39.026
through the fiery place
some years before,

32:39.060 --> 32:40.751
it counted as a good friend.

32:40.786 --> 32:43.685
♪ We are not alone

32:53.109 --> 32:55.387
- So dad, what do you think?

32:55.421 --> 32:57.423
- Ah I think it's
brilliant, Pearl.

32:57.458 --> 32:58.252
- Thanks.

32:59.943 --> 33:01.220
Here, I should hand you off.

33:01.255 --> 33:02.808
I've been hoarding you.

33:02.842 --> 33:03.774
- As usual.

33:05.328 --> 33:07.123
- Well there's
something I really had to talk

33:07.157 --> 33:09.021
to everyone about.

33:09.056 --> 33:11.506
So I met someone I like a lot.

33:11.541 --> 33:13.336
A girl here in Peru.

33:13.370 --> 33:15.545
And it's kind of serious.

33:15.579 --> 33:16.649
- That's cool, dad.

33:16.684 --> 33:18.203
Mom's been seeing someone too.

33:18.237 --> 33:19.445
- No she hasn't.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.517
I mean she did for
like three seconds.

33:23.656 --> 33:25.693
- Well I want you
all to meet her soon.

33:25.727 --> 33:27.039
- Are you flying home?

33:27.074 --> 33:29.524
- Well, no I can't really.

33:29.559 --> 33:31.871
You'll meet her
online next time.

33:31.906 --> 33:34.219
Mari's excited to meet you guys.

33:34.253 --> 33:36.566
But nervous, so be nice.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.569
- Hey, we're always nice here.

33:39.603 --> 33:42.503
I'm always nice here,
can't speak for the rest

33:42.537 --> 33:44.677
of these weirdos.

33:44.712 --> 33:47.508
- All right, well I gotta run.

33:47.542 --> 33:49.303
- No crazy stories this time?

33:49.337 --> 33:51.339
- Oh man, B, I'm late.

33:51.374 --> 33:53.548
But remind me to tell
you about the sloths

33:53.583 --> 33:55.412
in my hammock Tuesday.

33:55.447 --> 33:56.931
- Bye, bye.

34:01.556 --> 34:05.008
- Well, we should get immunized.

34:05.043 --> 34:09.116
Looks like this love
thing is contagious.

34:09.150 --> 34:10.841
- Dr. Song?

34:10.876 --> 34:15.605
You have a surprise inspection
from the HDA at reception.

34:17.364 --> 34:18.641
- Hey Sugar?

34:18.677 --> 34:20.610
Can you please pull
out our ADA compliance

34:20.643 --> 34:22.819
and bring them back to my,

34:26.132 --> 34:27.478
I thought you said ADA.

34:27.513 --> 34:29.239
- No, no, I said HDA.

34:30.620 --> 34:33.623
Which as you might recall
means Hot Dad Alert.

34:33.657 --> 34:38.005
You, you must have just
heard me wrong or something.

34:42.149 --> 34:44.875
- I've been
trying to call you.

34:44.909 --> 34:46.429
- Cole, I thought it was clear.

34:46.463 --> 34:48.327
There's nothing to discuss.

34:48.362 --> 34:49.984
- Yeah, but.

34:50.949 --> 34:52.262
There's something I need to say.

34:52.297 --> 34:53.125
- Okay.

34:54.782 --> 34:56.784
- I'm not your ex husband.

34:56.818 --> 34:58.475
- I know this, Cole.

34:58.510 --> 34:59.925
But it doesn't change.

34:59.959 --> 35:02.100
- No, but it should.

35:02.134 --> 35:04.861
Because you walked away
based on the possibility

35:04.895 --> 35:08.796
that I will make the same
selfish choice as he did.

35:08.830 --> 35:10.625
And I don't know if you noticed

35:10.660 --> 35:12.593
but I'm not exactly
irresponsible.

35:12.627 --> 35:13.456
- I know.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.876
- I was married for 20
years to a wonderful woman

35:19.910 --> 35:23.051
and we brought each and
every one of these kids

35:23.086 --> 35:25.813
into our hearts together.

35:25.847 --> 35:28.954
And when she died,
a part of me died.

35:30.714 --> 35:33.131
But you're not Sarah.

35:33.165 --> 35:33.993
- Okay.

35:36.203 --> 35:39.067
At least we agree on that.

35:39.102 --> 35:43.831
Look, Cole, I know you're
hurt, but it doesn't--

35:43.865 --> 35:45.798
- Susan, let me finish.

35:46.627 --> 35:48.318
I know how lucky I was

35:48.353 --> 35:52.219
that a lunkhead like me
with a woman like that,

35:52.253 --> 35:54.428
kind and smart and lovely,

35:55.601 --> 35:57.741
I would never feel
that way again.

35:57.776 --> 36:00.537
But it's okay
because of the kids.

36:02.643 --> 36:04.576
- I understand.

36:04.610 --> 36:06.750
- Until I kissed you.

36:06.785 --> 36:09.615
- Mmm, you didn't tell
me you two kissed.

36:09.650 --> 36:10.927
You didn't tell me that!

36:10.961 --> 36:11.755
- Sugar?

36:11.790 --> 36:12.963
- Huh?

36:12.998 --> 36:15.207
- I think maybe you can
go ahead and go now.

36:15.242 --> 36:16.450
- Just when it
starts getting good

36:16.484 --> 36:17.761
you tell me to leave, huh?

36:17.796 --> 36:18.935
Okay, okay.

36:18.969 --> 36:20.454
I'm leaving, okay.

36:21.834 --> 36:22.939
Adios.

36:22.973 --> 36:24.354
- Adios.

36:28.151 --> 36:28.979
Aye yai yai.

36:30.395 --> 36:31.741
- What was I saying?

36:31.775 --> 36:33.052
- I don't know.

36:34.502 --> 36:38.334
- When I kissed you
and you kissed me back

36:38.368 --> 36:40.646
I knew I was wrong.

36:40.681 --> 36:42.027
And I came to tell you,

36:42.061 --> 36:43.235
- And you have.

36:43.270 --> 36:46.065
- I came to tell you
that I was wrong about

36:46.100 --> 36:48.861
not being able to
fall in love again.

36:48.896 --> 36:50.760
You're not Sarah.

36:50.794 --> 36:54.142
You're Susan, and I
love how you talk fast

36:54.177 --> 36:56.110
when you're nervous
and how you try

36:56.144 --> 36:58.526
to fix the whole world.

36:58.561 --> 37:02.323
I love how you find
beauty where others don't.

37:04.394 --> 37:08.640
And I love how you search
people's faces for meaning.

37:08.674 --> 37:13.265
Like you can tell more than
what they're actually saying.

37:13.300 --> 37:16.544
Kind of like what
you're doing right now.

37:16.579 --> 37:17.925
- This is crazy.

37:23.344 --> 37:26.796
You know what, you're right
about searching faces.

37:26.830 --> 37:29.074
I knew everything I
needed to know about you

37:29.108 --> 37:30.696
the first hour over coffee.

37:30.731 --> 37:33.527
You're the kind of smart that
knows the important things

37:33.561 --> 37:34.700
books don't teach you.

37:34.735 --> 37:36.323
You fight for
things that matter.

37:36.357 --> 37:38.325
This is crazy.

37:38.359 --> 37:39.533
- Certifiably.

37:42.329 --> 37:44.917
- I can't just go off on dates
with little ones at home.

37:44.952 --> 37:46.505
You can't go off anytime.

37:46.540 --> 37:49.232
- I don't wanna date you, Susan.

37:50.509 --> 37:51.855
- Oh, you don't.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.099
- No.

37:55.687 --> 37:57.205
I wanna marry you.

38:02.763 --> 38:03.591
- Cole.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.942
You can't mean this.

38:12.393 --> 38:14.257
We've got 14 kids.

38:14.292 --> 38:17.778
We've only known each
other for a few months.

38:17.812 --> 38:21.989
You've got your practice
and I've got my business.

39:17.182 --> 39:18.459
My focus is off.

39:18.494 --> 39:19.702

You're like a smart,

a few months ago?

39:40.032 --> 39:41.137
- Yeah, okay.

39:42.138 --> 39:44.658
You got a serious daddy complex.

39:44.692 --> 39:46.073
He was hot but ancient.

39:55.013 --> 39:57.256
Gives me hope of not
dying an old maid.

39:57.291 --> 39:59.914
- You're 15 and on your

39:59.949 --> 40:00.777
- True.

40:01.778 --> 40:03.262

40:38.919 --> 40:40.368
I think we should
play around with it.

40:40.403 --> 40:41.369
- Okay.

40:41.404 --> 40:42.198
- Yeah.

40:47.134 --> 40:48.791
- Did you find any
tapers this week?

40:48.825 --> 40:50.827
- No such luck this
week, sweetheart.

40:50.862 --> 40:53.554
But I did get some sweet
shots of a jaguar on the hunt

40:53.589 --> 40:55.245
stalking a wild pig.

40:56.799 --> 40:58.283
- Did it end well?

40:59.526 --> 41:00.975
- Well depends on
your perspective.

41:01.010 --> 41:02.805
The jaguar or the pig's.

41:02.839 --> 41:04.358
Everyone has to eat, right?

41:04.392 --> 41:06.843
- Oh gross, I don't wanna know.

41:06.878 --> 41:09.328
Hey guys, dad's on the phone.

41:10.502 --> 41:13.367
- Well, I think
it's fascinating.

41:13.401 --> 41:15.162
Part of nature, right dad?

41:15.196 --> 41:16.439
Did you get the kill shot?

41:16.474 --> 41:17.440
- You're twisted.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.924
- Of course.

41:18.959 --> 41:20.685
So is everyone there?

41:21.858 --> 41:23.860
Well I mentioned that
I was seeing someone

41:23.895 --> 41:26.069
and it's gotten quite serious.

41:26.104 --> 41:29.417
And I wanted to let
you guys know that

41:29.452 --> 41:31.005
I'm gonna be moving in with Mari

41:31.040 --> 41:33.352
and help run her ranch in Peru.

41:33.387 --> 41:34.802
- Oh that's huge.

41:35.665 --> 41:37.184
- Yeah.

41:37.218 --> 41:41.222
Well I guess I'm settling
down a bit in my old age.

41:41.257 --> 41:44.294
- How is this gonna
work with the magazine?

41:44.329 --> 41:46.227
You need to be able to take
off at a moment's notice

41:46.262 --> 41:48.091
to chase down pics.

41:48.126 --> 41:49.368
- Well, I quit.

41:50.784 --> 41:51.578
- What?

41:52.993 --> 41:54.304
Are you serious?

41:54.339 --> 41:55.754
You love your work.

41:55.789 --> 41:57.584
- How are you going
to make a living?

41:57.618 --> 41:59.447
- Well from the ranch.

41:59.482 --> 42:00.725
It'll be a struggle at first.

42:00.759 --> 42:02.381
I won't make as much.

42:02.416 --> 42:05.764
But I'm not gonna be on the
road all the time anymore.

42:05.799 --> 42:08.318
I'm gonna be settled
in one place.

42:08.353 --> 42:12.253
- Yeah, like a thousand
miles from your family.

42:12.288 --> 42:15.325
- Well Mari is my
family too, Pearl.

42:15.360 --> 42:17.362
I'm gonna marry her.

42:17.396 --> 42:18.881
- What?

42:18.915 --> 42:20.710
- Sorry, I meant
for that information

42:20.745 --> 42:22.574
to come out differently.

42:22.609 --> 42:24.093
But yeah.

42:24.127 --> 42:26.958
Congratulate me,
I'm getting married.

42:26.992 --> 42:28.753
- Congratulations, dad.

42:28.787 --> 42:30.133
- Is she nice, daddy?

42:30.168 --> 42:32.377
- Ah, the best, B.

42:32.411 --> 42:34.379
I want you all to meet her soon.

42:34.413 --> 42:36.484
- When are you coming?

42:36.519 --> 42:38.176
- Well I meant online.

42:38.210 --> 42:40.972
I can't afford
travel for a while.

42:41.006 --> 42:44.147
There's not gonna be a
lot of extras this year.

42:44.182 --> 42:46.080
- What about Grammy camp?

42:46.115 --> 42:47.357
You promised.

42:47.392 --> 42:49.187
- Oh man, sweet P.

42:49.221 --> 42:50.360
Not this year.

42:51.741 --> 42:56.366
We have some serious financial
investments on the farm.

42:57.264 --> 42:58.783
- Well, I'm happy for you.

43:00.060 --> 43:00.854
- Thanks.

43:02.269 --> 43:07.101
So, who wants to hear about
the sloth in my hammock?

43:20.218 --> 43:21.288
- Well hello.

43:22.323 --> 43:23.670
How's the rat race?

43:23.704 --> 43:26.811
You feeling like the
cheese or the rat today?

43:26.845 --> 43:28.640
- Oh my goodness.

43:28.675 --> 43:30.331
You're Mr.,

43:30.366 --> 43:32.402
I mean Sam Bennett.

43:32.437 --> 43:34.163
It's nice to meet you in person.

43:34.197 --> 43:35.854
- Nice to meet you, Miss Song.

43:35.889 --> 43:38.477
I hear you'd made quite
an impression on my boy.

43:38.512 --> 43:41.308
- Oh I suppose so, but then
again he's easily impressed.

43:41.342 --> 43:44.104
- If you say so.

43:44.138 --> 43:47.935
- So, you're famous for
your perfect advice.

43:47.970 --> 43:50.282
You got any suggestions
for meeting the kids?

43:50.317 --> 43:51.145
- Huh.

43:52.595 --> 43:54.114
Yes.

43:54.148 --> 43:56.323
Don't look them
directly in the eye.

43:56.357 --> 43:58.014
They can smell fear.

43:58.049 --> 44:01.397
It's kind of like
blood in the water.

44:01.431 --> 44:02.536
- Okay, yeah.

44:03.675 --> 44:06.298
You, you're not
really making me feel

44:06.333 --> 44:08.162
any calmer about this.

44:09.025 --> 44:11.372
- Look, they love their dad.

44:12.339 --> 44:13.996
You make their dad happy.

44:14.030 --> 44:16.515
What else does
anyone need to know?

44:16.550 --> 44:17.344
- Hey grandpa.

44:17.378 --> 44:18.276
- Hey Dylan.

44:18.310 --> 44:19.760
- It's so nice to meet you.

44:19.795 --> 44:21.210
- Dylan, I'm gonna leave
this lovely lady with you

44:21.244 --> 44:24.247
'cause I need to change
clothes for a news interview.

44:24.282 --> 44:25.110
- Okay.

44:26.249 --> 44:27.768
- Good luck, Susan.

44:27.803 --> 44:28.666
- Thanks.

44:31.599 --> 44:33.015
How are classes going?

44:33.049 --> 44:34.810
- School's never really
been my strong suit

44:34.844 --> 44:36.535
but a college dormitory
is a lot quieter

44:36.570 --> 44:37.985
than living here.

44:39.090 --> 44:40.574
Can I get you
something to drink?

44:40.608 --> 44:41.540
Wine, beer?

44:45.613 --> 44:47.132
- No.

44:47.167 --> 44:50.239
No, I don't drink very much.

44:50.273 --> 44:52.241
But some water would be nice.

44:52.275 --> 44:53.587
- Certainly.

44:53.621 --> 44:56.452
Yo, Miles, Frank,
come say hello.

44:56.486 --> 44:58.523
This is Dr. Song.

44:58.557 --> 45:00.214
- Good evening, Dr. Song.

45:00.249 --> 45:01.319
- Hi.

45:01.353 --> 45:03.355
- Please, call me Susan.

45:05.772 --> 45:10.742
I have heard so much about
you two little geniuses.

45:10.777 --> 45:11.985
- Well, speak up boys.

45:12.019 --> 45:14.159
I was just gonna get
Susan a glass of water.

45:14.194 --> 45:16.748
- Oh, no, we've got it.

45:16.783 --> 45:18.405
How about a cup
of blackberry tea?

45:18.439 --> 45:20.476
Janis and I just made a pitcher.

45:20.510 --> 45:22.581
- Sure, that sounds lovely.

45:22.616 --> 45:24.756
- Yeah, we'll go get that.

45:31.418 --> 45:33.903
- Daddy'll be home any minute.

45:35.318 --> 45:36.768
- You're pretty.

45:36.803 --> 45:38.183
- Oh, thank you.

45:38.218 --> 45:39.460
So are you.

45:39.495 --> 45:40.565
- Thanks.

45:40.599 --> 45:41.739
- Jimmie?

45:41.773 --> 45:42.912
- Mhmm.

45:42.947 --> 45:45.087
- And that little
cutie must be Billie.

45:45.121 --> 45:47.296
Which would make you Etta.

45:49.367 --> 45:50.575
Oh!

45:50.609 --> 45:53.267
- She's been like
a lion all day.

45:53.302 --> 45:55.753
- Well lions are my favorite.

45:55.787 --> 45:57.582
- I like orangutans.

45:57.616 --> 45:59.722
Wanna see me be like one?

45:59.757 --> 46:01.586
- I would like nothing
better than that.

46:07.385 --> 46:08.213
Thank you.

46:23.850 --> 46:25.334
Mmm.

46:25.368 --> 46:27.474
This is delicious, girls.

46:29.027 --> 46:31.478
I feel like I know each of you.

46:31.512 --> 46:34.308
Your dad is so proud of you all.

46:34.343 --> 46:36.759
- So we know you're
a dentist and all.

46:36.794 --> 46:39.797
I guess you must
have perfect teeth.

46:41.626 --> 46:45.457
- Well, that doesn't
always go hand in hand.

46:45.492 --> 46:48.667
I had a dentist as a child
with a mouthful of fillings.

46:50.324 --> 46:52.430
- Sorry to leave
you to the wolves

46:52.464 --> 46:53.327
but I'm in here now.

46:53.362 --> 46:55.605
Better late than never.

46:55.640 --> 46:59.506
Oh, and it looks like
I'm a little late.

46:59.540 --> 47:01.715
Someone care to explain?

47:01.749 --> 47:02.716
- What's the matter, Cole?

47:02.750 --> 47:04.718
We've been getting along great.

47:04.752 --> 47:06.202
- Oh, yeah.

47:06.237 --> 47:07.755
I'm sure you have.

47:09.205 --> 47:13.002
But someone had a little
bit of fun at your expense

47:13.037 --> 47:16.109
and we're gonna need
some toothpaste,

47:20.078 --> 47:22.632
a toothbrush, Etta
fetch the supplies.

47:22.667 --> 47:24.013
- It's just food dye.

47:24.048 --> 47:25.739
- A lot of food dye.

47:34.265 --> 47:35.197
- Ah, yeah.

47:37.406 --> 47:40.961
And maybe a little
baking soda as well.

47:40.996 --> 47:43.895
And boys, if you're
thinking a little,

47:43.930 --> 47:46.829
sorry, a lot of food dye
is going to scare me away,

47:46.864 --> 47:50.937
you're seriously underestimating
my capacity for vengeance.

47:50.971 --> 47:53.284
- Yeah, baking
soda on the double.

47:53.318 --> 47:54.664
Good luck, boys.

48:01.844 --> 48:04.536
- And here I thought
they liked me.

48:04.571 --> 48:06.055
- Oh no, you were.

48:07.367 --> 48:08.816
I mean if they didn't like you

48:08.851 --> 48:12.993
your hair'd probably be
falling out right about now.

48:15.927 --> 48:17.239
- You know what?

48:18.447 --> 48:20.414
I do look good.

48:20.449 --> 48:21.277
- Sure.

48:22.175 --> 48:23.141
- Give me a kiss.

48:23.176 --> 48:24.936
- No, no, no, no, no.

48:32.392 --> 48:35.878
- Mom, stop moving, you're
gonna look like a clown.

48:35.913 --> 48:38.363
- I can't
help it, I'm nervous.

48:38.398 --> 48:40.227
- You got cold feet,
we can call it off.

48:40.262 --> 48:44.266
- Nope, sorry Pearl,
but this is happening.

48:44.300 --> 48:47.062
There's no going back now.

48:47.096 --> 48:49.823
- Why, you're not
pregnant, are you?

48:49.857 --> 48:50.686
- Huh.

48:52.964 --> 48:55.380
Did you hear from your dad yet?

48:55.415 --> 48:57.520
- No, change the subject.

48:59.798 --> 49:00.592
- Pearl.

49:02.008 --> 49:05.666
He has to be able to have
some life of his own.

49:05.701 --> 49:06.909
- I know.

49:06.944 --> 49:08.980
I was just really
counting on him,

49:09.015 --> 49:11.879
but I'll figure it
out myself, okay?

49:11.914 --> 49:13.226
It's fine, like.

49:16.332 --> 49:19.749
- Well mom, you just have
to have your own life too.

49:19.784 --> 49:21.613
And today is your day.

49:24.306 --> 49:26.170
- You're right.

49:26.204 --> 49:27.447
I'm sorry, mom.

49:28.379 --> 49:29.967
You look beautiful.

49:31.416 --> 49:32.624
- Let's see.

49:32.659 --> 49:35.558
Something borrowed,
something blue.

49:36.663 --> 49:38.492
Something old.

49:38.527 --> 49:39.666
- Oh!

49:39.700 --> 49:43.532
Mom, did you find
grandmammy's locket yet?

49:43.566 --> 49:44.878
- Oh, locket.

49:44.912 --> 49:48.019
You know my mother had
the prettiest locket.

49:48.054 --> 49:52.161
I think I had it here
in my purse earlier.

49:52.196 --> 49:54.508
- That's what you're
meant to be looking for.

49:54.543 --> 49:55.751
Do you need any help?

49:55.785 --> 49:56.994
- What is this?

49:58.616 --> 49:59.893
It's a whisker.

50:01.722 --> 50:05.278
I think the cat's been
nesting in this bed.

50:06.210 --> 50:09.454
- Grandma, we don't have a cat.

50:09.489 --> 50:12.975
- You know, on the
television last night,

50:13.010 --> 50:14.425
there was a lion.

50:15.633 --> 50:18.360
And this woman in
a kimono killed it

50:19.395 --> 50:21.570
with this video game guns.

50:23.779 --> 50:27.886
And then she put the lion's
whiskers in her soup.

50:36.205 --> 50:38.138
A lovely seat!

50:38.173 --> 50:40.899
Did you buy this chair, Susan?

50:40.934 --> 50:43.695
- No mom.

50:43.730 --> 50:47.423
- Now, which of you
girls is getting married?

50:49.115 --> 50:50.047
- I am, mom.

50:51.807 --> 50:54.361
- You're not pregnant, are you?

50:58.124 --> 50:59.746
- No mom.

50:59.780 --> 51:01.023
- Good.

51:01.058 --> 51:04.544
I'm too young to be a
grandmother, you know.

51:06.891 --> 51:09.238
- Well, it looks like
it's time for you

51:09.273 --> 51:12.345
to be getting into that dress.

51:12.379 --> 51:14.416
- Yup, all right.

51:14.450 --> 51:16.383
Well, this is it, yeah.

51:18.040 --> 51:20.629
Quick, group hug
before I'm surrounded

51:20.663 --> 51:22.527
by 20 yards of satin.

51:22.562 --> 51:25.220
I mean, quick, group hug
before I'm surrounded

51:25.254 --> 51:29.258
by 20 yards of tool!

51:30.673 --> 51:33.020
- Ooh, what a lovely locket.

51:34.125 --> 51:36.817
This looks just like my mothers.

51:36.852 --> 51:39.751
I wonder how this got in here?

51:44.170 --> 51:46.724
- Blessed are those who gather.

51:47.759 --> 51:52.109
For life is full of firsts.
And for this family,

51:52.143 --> 51:55.146
the surprises are
just the beginning.

51:57.079 --> 51:59.426
And I am certain that life

51:59.461 --> 52:02.257
from this day forth
for this family

52:04.466 --> 52:06.192
be full of surprises.

52:08.435 --> 52:09.954
Shall we get to it?

52:09.988 --> 52:10.817
- Please.

52:13.337 --> 52:16.719
- Who here gives this
woman to we'd this man?

52:16.754 --> 52:17.720
- I.

52:17.755 --> 52:18.928
- We do!

52:44.506 --> 52:47.267
- One more trip
and then we got it.

52:47.302 --> 52:50.063
And then we got some
serious unpacking to do.

52:50.097 --> 52:52.652
- Can't we just get
takeout, start tomorrow?

52:52.686 --> 52:54.274
- Ah, you wish.

52:54.309 --> 52:57.553
- Can't we just live in the
backyard and start next year?

52:57.588 --> 52:59.383
- Yes, no, no, no, no.

53:00.798 --> 53:02.006
No.

53:02.040 --> 53:03.594
- Oh, fine.

53:03.628 --> 53:05.665
- Hi, I'm Stevie Hawkins-White

53:05.699 --> 53:09.807
and these are my daughters
Elizabeth and Winnifred.

53:09.841 --> 53:10.808
- Hi.

53:10.842 --> 53:12.396
- Hi, you must be our neighbor.

53:12.430 --> 53:13.673
I'm Susan Song.

53:14.605 --> 53:17.263
I mean Susan Bennett-Song.

53:17.297 --> 53:20.300
This is my husband,
Cole Bennett-Song.

53:20.335 --> 53:22.233
- My grandfather
built your house.

53:22.268 --> 53:24.097
Well, his workers did.

53:25.754 --> 53:27.238
- I'm the president of
the homeowners association

53:27.273 --> 53:29.930
so we just wanted
to welcome you.

53:29.965 --> 53:30.931
- Thank you.

53:30.966 --> 53:33.520
Yeah, I appreciate it.

53:33.555 --> 53:35.626
- And I also brought
over the HOA bylaws

53:35.660 --> 53:37.248
so please make
sure you read them.

53:37.283 --> 53:39.181
- Okay, thanks.

53:39.216 --> 53:40.872
Hey Jules, can you
put this in the study

53:40.907 --> 53:42.667
in the home filing cabinet?

53:42.702 --> 53:44.428
- Jules is such an
interesting name.

53:44.462 --> 53:45.981
I mean what girl
doesn't like diamonds.

53:46.015 --> 53:48.673
- Oh it's J-U-L-E-S.

53:48.708 --> 53:49.847
After Jules Verne.

53:49.881 --> 53:51.124
- Is that an actress?

53:51.158 --> 53:54.817
- No, he wrote 10,000
Leagues Under the Sea.

53:55.853 --> 53:56.923
- I don't really read that much.

53:56.957 --> 53:58.787
I'm always on the go, you know.

53:58.821 --> 54:00.029
You're really lucky
that your daughter

54:00.064 --> 54:01.376
has so many friends to
help you with the move.

54:01.410 --> 54:03.826
- Yeah, um, they're all ours.

54:07.347 --> 54:09.246
No really, they're all ours.

54:09.280 --> 54:10.247
- You're kidding.

54:10.281 --> 54:11.593
- Nope, happily.

54:13.042 --> 54:15.148
We're still getting used to it.

54:15.182 --> 54:17.771
We just got married last week.

54:19.566 --> 54:21.258
- Wow, that's a lot.

54:22.155 --> 54:23.260
Eight of them?

54:23.294 --> 54:25.434
- Uh, yes, 14.

54:25.710 --> 54:26.780
- 14?

54:26.815 --> 54:29.645
Oh

54:29.680 --> 54:32.269
- Yeah, oop, there's my
little jumping bean right now.

54:32.303 --> 54:33.615
Hey.

54:33.649 --> 54:35.513
- I'm not a jumping bean, daddy.

54:35.548 --> 54:37.826
I'm a girl, I have a vagina.

54:37.860 --> 54:39.586
- Oh yeah, right.

54:39.621 --> 54:44.902
Billie, say hi to
Mrs. Whitehawk?

54:45.730 --> 54:47.387
- Mrs. Hawkins-White.

54:47.422 --> 54:50.597
- Daddy doesn't have
a vagina, he's a boy.

54:50.632 --> 54:51.598
Right daddy?

54:51.633 --> 54:53.393
- Right sweety.

54:53.428 --> 54:55.326
- What's a vagina, mama?

54:55.361 --> 54:56.672
- We're leaving.

55:00.918 --> 55:02.747
- Well that was weird.

55:04.370 --> 55:08.166
- Do you think we're
gonna get an invitation

55:08.201 --> 55:10.272
from Mrs. Hawkins-White
to the yacht club

55:10.307 --> 55:11.998
for our family this weekend?

55:12.032 --> 55:13.206
- I wouldn't go off

55:13.240 --> 55:15.657
start blocking up
your social engagement

55:15.691 --> 55:17.762
calendar anytime soon.

55:17.797 --> 55:18.625
- Ah, man.

55:19.799 --> 55:20.903
- All right, slacker.

55:20.938 --> 55:22.353
Back to work.

55:22.388 --> 55:23.216
Come on!

55:25.322 --> 55:26.806
- I like the new group, girl.

55:26.840 --> 55:28.497
- Yeah, it's cool.

55:28.532 --> 55:30.223
A little crowded.

55:31.638 --> 55:33.191
- Instruments in
the garage, right?

55:33.226 --> 55:34.054
- Yeah.

55:38.680 --> 55:39.957
- Did you see that?

55:39.991 --> 55:41.545
- That looks promising.

55:41.579 --> 55:43.305
- Promising?

55:43.340 --> 55:45.997
Looks like every
Christmas wish come true.

55:46.032 --> 55:46.998
- What?

55:47.033 --> 55:48.345
- Is that your new brother?

55:48.379 --> 55:49.449
- Yeah.

55:49.484 --> 55:51.313
All three of them.

55:51.348 --> 55:53.315
Dylan's actually really nice

55:53.350 --> 55:55.006
but way too old for you.

55:55.041 --> 55:58.838
And Miles, the second
one, is a total geek.

55:58.872 --> 56:02.980
But the pale one has taken up
half of one of the bedrooms

56:03.014 --> 56:05.051
with enough technology
to launch NASA

56:05.085 --> 56:10.090
and has the same sparkling
personality as his robots.

56:10.677 --> 56:11.195
- Dylan, huh?

56:12.230 --> 56:14.060
How about Hotty Mchotness?

56:14.094 --> 56:16.269
How do you live in a
house with a teen version

56:16.303 --> 56:19.030
of Johnny Depp without
breaking all laws of nature?

56:19.065 --> 56:20.446
- Down, girl.

56:20.480 --> 56:23.034
I don't think they were talking
about the hot stepbrother.

56:23.069 --> 56:25.485
Did you see what they were
carrying to the garage?

56:25.520 --> 56:28.212
- Besides my neatly
packaged heart?

56:28.246 --> 56:29.455
No.

56:29.489 --> 56:31.560
- A drumkit and a
nice one at that.

56:31.595 --> 56:35.322
- I vote that we can forget
about this girl drummer thing.

56:35.357 --> 56:36.807
If he's good he's in.

56:36.841 --> 56:39.223
- I really wanted to
stick to an all girl band.

56:39.257 --> 56:40.707
- Hey but you said,
there aren't any decent

56:40.742 --> 56:42.122
girl drummers around.

56:42.157 --> 56:44.228
- Oh I think there's something
you guys should know.

56:44.262 --> 56:46.057
- Not now, Etta, okay please?

56:46.092 --> 56:47.645
We're in the middle
of something.

56:47.680 --> 56:48.577
- Whatever.

56:49.992 --> 56:51.822
- Look, you're always saying
that we should be trying

56:51.856 --> 56:53.962
to sell diversity and story?

56:53.996 --> 56:57.621
I mean and he's your
brother right, and Romanian.

56:57.655 --> 56:59.243
- You know what, fine.

56:59.277 --> 57:01.418
But he has to be really good or,

57:08.735 --> 57:12.049
- Hi, what do
you guys wanna know?

57:12.083 --> 57:13.671
- Janis, how can you?

57:13.706 --> 57:16.294
Like I had no idea
you were so good.

57:16.329 --> 57:18.504
So I mean, do you think
you can hold down a beat

57:18.538 --> 57:19.643
with a full band?

57:19.677 --> 57:21.645
- No, I miss cues.

57:21.679 --> 57:24.579
If I can't hear what you
guys are all playing.

57:24.613 --> 57:26.166
- Oh yeah.

57:26.201 --> 57:27.720
That's okay sis.

57:27.754 --> 57:31.240
- Well, what if
you could see it?

57:31.275 --> 57:32.483
- How?

57:32.518 --> 57:34.002
Even if someone was
right in front of me

57:34.036 --> 57:36.867
I wouldn't be able to see
every note over the kit.

57:36.901 --> 57:38.351
- Well I could hook up
the other instruments

57:38.385 --> 57:39.835
to an adaptive music program

57:39.870 --> 57:41.596
and Miles could help
me with the coding.

57:41.630 --> 57:44.322
You'd see color coded notes
and rhythms on a screen

57:44.357 --> 57:45.358
right next to you.

57:45.392 --> 57:46.393
Real time.

57:46.428 --> 57:47.843
- You would do that for us?

57:47.878 --> 57:48.706
- Pff, no.

57:49.914 --> 57:51.951
But I'd do it for her.

57:51.985 --> 57:52.779
If she wants me to.

57:52.814 --> 57:53.608
- Yes!

57:53.642 --> 57:54.712
Thank you!

57:54.747 --> 57:56.162
- Looks like we have a drummer.

57:56.196 --> 57:57.543
- And a sweet story too.

57:57.577 --> 58:00.442
- I mean, if robot and
braniac can get this to work.

58:00.477 --> 58:02.582
- Pff, we can get it.

58:02.617 --> 58:03.514
- We got a drummer!

58:03.549 --> 58:04.895
Oh my god, this is gonna work!

58:04.929 --> 58:05.827
- Yes, finally.

58:05.861 --> 58:07.104
- We're gonna make the deadline.

58:07.138 --> 58:11.488
- Uh,

58:31.784 --> 58:34.856
- Hey, what can I do for you?

58:34.890 --> 58:37.134
- I was just wondering if
you read that HOA bylaws?

58:37.168 --> 58:39.619
- Uh no, we've been swamped.

58:39.654 --> 58:42.035
So maybe you can sum
up the highlights.

58:42.070 --> 58:44.382
- The highlights are that you
have to read the HOA bylaws.

58:44.417 --> 58:46.212
It's all very important.

58:46.246 --> 58:48.663
In the meantime, there
is a noise ordinance.

58:48.697 --> 58:51.320
- Did I scream too loud
when I smashed my thumb

58:51.355 --> 58:53.253
with a hammer earlier?

58:53.288 --> 58:54.876
- It's 62 decibels.

58:54.910 --> 58:56.015
And the sounds coming
out of the garage

58:56.049 --> 58:57.050
far exceeds that.

58:57.085 --> 58:57.913
- 62.

58:59.259 --> 59:01.158
Sounds like I'm gonna
have to put a muffler

59:01.192 --> 59:02.573
on my lawnmower.

59:02.608 --> 59:06.232
I'll insulate the
walls in the garage.

59:06.750 --> 59:08.372
But let me hang my curtains

59:08.406 --> 59:10.581
and let me put
some beds together

59:10.616 --> 59:12.410
'cause I'm sure you don't
want me walking by the windows

59:12.445 --> 59:13.791
in my skivvies, right?

59:13.826 --> 59:15.482
- Fine.

59:15.517 --> 59:17.830
Please, just have your
children quiet down.

59:17.864 --> 59:20.039
- Sure, my daughter though,
she has some music deadlines

59:20.073 --> 59:23.042
so um, I'll have
them stop by eight.

59:23.076 --> 59:24.975
- These are quiet estate homes.

59:25.009 --> 59:27.529
Not Bourbon Street Whiskey
halls.

59:27.564 --> 59:29.393
- Let me assure you,
I put strict limits

59:29.427 --> 59:32.154
on the amount of whiskey
that my kids can drink.

59:32.189 --> 59:34.018
- Your jokes aren't
gonna work with me.

59:34.053 --> 59:34.881
Good day.

59:38.264 --> 59:39.092
- Hey.

59:40.300 --> 59:42.026
Can one of you tell
me why I found holes

59:42.061 --> 59:45.133
with scorch marks on the back
end of both of your jeans?

59:45.167 --> 59:47.376
- We were lighting
each other's farts.

59:47.411 --> 59:49.447
- Yeah it kind of
got out of hand.

59:49.482 --> 59:51.242
You know how it is.

59:51.277 --> 59:52.140
- Uh huh.

59:53.279 --> 59:54.625
And I don't suppose
either of you know

59:54.660 --> 59:55.799
how we ended up with a dead frog

59:55.833 --> 59:56.869
in the washing machine?

59:56.903 --> 59:58.387
- Oh no, Bob is--

59:58.422 --> 01:00:00.286
- No, definitely not.

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.944
We have no knowledge
of this frog.

01:00:02.978 --> 01:00:04.221
- Yep, nothing.

01:00:05.118 --> 01:00:05.947
- Uh huh.

01:00:07.051 --> 01:00:07.880
And Toni.

01:00:09.226 --> 01:00:13.057
I just got milk out of
the family room carpet.

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.335
Will you stop letting the dog

01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:16.751
lick milk out of your mouth?

01:00:16.785 --> 01:00:18.718
- But she likes it!

01:00:18.753 --> 01:00:20.547
- Dude, that's nasty.

01:00:21.963 --> 01:00:25.104
- Yeah, well you're the one
that peed in the backyard.

01:00:25.138 --> 01:00:26.484
- Paulo, please.

01:00:28.072 --> 01:00:30.005
Mrs. White is developing
an entire dossier

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.699
on our family and probably
has hidden cameras installed.

01:00:33.733 --> 01:00:35.355
- What's a dossier?

01:00:36.736 --> 01:00:39.014
- Never mind, just come
indoors when you need to pee.

01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:39.843
Please.

01:00:41.085 --> 01:00:41.879
Please?

01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:44.364
Please?

01:00:48.575 --> 01:00:49.818
Well, someone is
up from her nap.

01:00:49.853 --> 01:00:50.819
- Where's Pearl?

01:00:50.854 --> 01:00:52.959
- She's in the garage.

01:00:52.994 --> 01:00:55.134
Did you get into the
birthday cupcake, sweety?

01:00:55.168 --> 01:00:57.723
- It was an accident,
I'm going to be four.

01:00:57.757 --> 01:00:58.827
- Really, an accident?

01:00:58.862 --> 01:01:00.967
- I think the dog did it.

01:01:01.002 --> 01:01:02.693
- Dog, huh?

01:01:02.728 --> 01:01:05.662
Well, let's get you a bath.

01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:07.767
- No, Pearl, Pearl can help me.

01:01:07.802 --> 01:01:09.044
- Really?

01:01:09.079 --> 01:01:11.737
Okay, let's go find your sister.

01:01:20.124 --> 01:01:21.401
- Hello.

01:01:21.436 --> 01:01:22.644
- Hey.

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:24.715
They called you in too?

01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:27.200
- Yeah, I don't know why
they'd bug you at work,

01:01:27.235 --> 01:01:28.788
I said I'd be here.

01:01:29.927 --> 01:01:32.930
- Maybe Pearl pushed
them to call me.

01:01:32.965 --> 01:01:34.725
- Pearl, what does she
have to do with this?

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.175
- She and Toni are
the ones in trouble.

01:01:36.209 --> 01:01:37.314
Jimmie's fine.

01:01:37.348 --> 01:01:38.591
- Jimmie?

01:01:38.625 --> 01:01:40.800
I'm here for Miles.

01:01:40.835 --> 01:01:41.698
- What?

01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:45.529
- Mr. Bennett.

01:01:46.979 --> 01:01:51.293
We have a strict policy
on inappropriate language.

01:01:51.328 --> 01:01:52.156
- Okay.

01:01:53.295 --> 01:01:55.228
- Miles is an
excellent student but,

01:01:55.263 --> 01:01:57.921
I cannot exempt
him from the rules.

01:01:57.955 --> 01:02:00.302
- I understand, I'm
just not used to him

01:02:00.337 --> 01:02:02.408
being a rule breaker.

01:02:02.442 --> 01:02:05.756
What exactly were the
offending remarks?

01:02:05.791 --> 01:02:07.137
- For the purpose of
enlightening your father,

01:02:07.171 --> 01:02:09.518
you can repeat the joke.

01:02:09.553 --> 01:02:11.210
- It was a science joke.

01:02:11.244 --> 01:02:12.211
Snowmen have snowballs,

01:02:12.245 --> 01:02:14.109
what does a snowwoman have?

01:02:14.144 --> 01:02:15.559
- What?

01:02:15.593 --> 01:02:16.663
- Snowvaries.

01:02:18.182 --> 01:02:19.528
See, it's funny.

01:02:22.566 --> 01:02:25.327
- It does show a
good understanding

01:02:25.362 --> 01:02:27.536
of human biology and puns.

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:30.608
- The discussion of
ones private parts,

01:02:30.643 --> 01:02:33.301
whether in jest or
not, is a violation

01:02:33.335 --> 01:02:36.235
of the respect
code, Mr. Bennett.

01:02:36.269 --> 01:02:37.857
- Yeah, but he said snowballs.

01:02:37.892 --> 01:02:40.549
I'm sure an otherwise
well adjusted student

01:02:40.584 --> 01:02:44.346
could say tennis balls
or chicken breasts

01:02:44.381 --> 01:02:47.556
without the PC police
carrying them off to juvie.

01:02:47.591 --> 01:02:49.627
- Context is important.

01:02:49.662 --> 01:02:51.733
But I can't make exceptions.

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.700
Look, this is just a meeting.

01:02:53.735 --> 01:02:55.772
No permanent record.

01:02:55.806 --> 01:02:57.083
Can you please
just bring him home

01:02:57.118 --> 01:02:58.395
and have a conversation with him

01:02:58.429 --> 01:03:00.707
about filters and
boundaries in school?

01:03:00.742 --> 01:03:02.330
- Certainly, Miss Anderson.

01:03:02.364 --> 01:03:05.574
Well, I apologize
for the trouble.

01:03:05.609 --> 01:03:08.819
- Thank you for your
time, Mr. Bennett.

01:03:17.932 --> 01:03:19.312
- So?

01:03:19.347 --> 01:03:20.831
- Oh, no biggie.

01:03:20.866 --> 01:03:25.836
They said to talk to Miles
about boundaries and filters.

01:03:26.457 --> 01:03:27.320
- You, really?

01:03:28.287 --> 01:03:29.633
- I know, right.

01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:31.773
- Anyway,

01:03:32.947 --> 01:03:35.950
Apparently, Toni hit
both of these boys.

01:03:37.296 --> 01:03:38.297
- Two dudes?

01:03:39.539 --> 01:03:40.368
Why?

01:03:41.472 --> 01:03:42.853
- They were calling
Jimmie bad names

01:03:42.888 --> 01:03:44.890
like racial stuff.

01:03:44.924 --> 01:03:47.133
And she was really scared.

01:03:47.168 --> 01:03:50.343
She was trapped, and
I was really mad.

01:03:51.897 --> 01:03:55.072
- Okay now I understand
that you'd be angry

01:03:55.107 --> 01:03:58.041
but just because you
get mad doesn't mean

01:03:58.075 --> 01:03:59.628
you can hit people.

01:04:01.009 --> 01:04:02.597
You know what I
do when I get mad

01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:06.152
is I take a deep breath
and I blow it out slowly

01:04:06.187 --> 01:04:07.878
while I count to 10.

01:04:07.913 --> 01:04:08.879
Like this.

01:04:10.536 --> 01:04:12.503
- How does blowing on them help?

01:04:12.538 --> 01:04:15.403
- All you need to do
is meet hate with love.

01:04:15.437 --> 01:04:18.337
When you love your enemies,
they become your friends.

01:04:18.371 --> 01:04:21.271
- Wow, that is wise, Paulo.

01:04:21.305 --> 01:04:23.169
- That doesn't mean you
should smooch them though.

01:04:23.204 --> 01:04:25.344
That would be gross.

01:04:25.378 --> 01:04:26.207
- Yeah.

01:04:27.311 --> 01:04:28.692
So what are you here for?

01:04:28.726 --> 01:04:30.797
- Witness for defenseman.

01:04:30.832 --> 01:04:31.660
- And you?

01:04:33.386 --> 01:04:35.664
- Paulo ran to get
me and I told them

01:04:35.699 --> 01:04:37.321
if they wanted to mess
with my other sister,

01:04:37.356 --> 01:04:39.013
they were gonna have
to go through me.

01:04:39.047 --> 01:04:41.739
- I don't see a
problem with that.

01:04:41.774 --> 01:04:44.294
- I may have implied that
I'm an Asian karate ninja

01:04:44.328 --> 01:04:47.124
that knows how to rip out
the hearts of their enemies.

01:04:47.159 --> 01:04:49.609
- Okay, so that's terrifying.

01:04:50.576 --> 01:04:51.404
- And?

01:04:54.787 --> 01:04:58.584
- And I may have called them
racist little punk ass bitches.

01:04:58.618 --> 01:04:59.447
- Ooh.

01:05:00.793 --> 01:05:01.621
Okay.

01:05:03.727 --> 01:05:04.555
- Listen.

01:05:06.695 --> 01:05:09.906
I think it's wonderful that
you both stood up for Jimmie.

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:12.943
But we need to understand that
there is an appropriate way

01:05:12.978 --> 01:05:15.739
to deal with things in school.

01:05:15.773 --> 01:05:16.809
Tonight I think we need to have

01:05:16.843 --> 01:05:19.432
a family chat about boundaries.

01:05:21.987 --> 01:05:24.506
- Now the standard in these
situations is to speak

01:05:24.541 --> 01:05:27.164
with the victims of
school violence first.

01:05:27.199 --> 01:05:28.994
- Excuse me, victims?

01:05:29.028 --> 01:05:30.305
- You are aware that
your daughter hit

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.100
both of these boys.

01:05:32.135 --> 01:05:33.412
- They were calling
my sister names

01:05:33.446 --> 01:05:35.103
and made her cry.

01:05:35.138 --> 01:05:37.002
- Toni, I'm sure you
heard the expression

01:05:37.036 --> 01:05:38.900
sticks and stones.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:42.317
Now name calling is never an
excuse for physical violence.

01:05:42.352 --> 01:05:45.976
- No, sometimes they
hit a lot harder.

01:05:46.011 --> 01:05:47.944
Look, I understand that
you have your policies,

01:05:47.978 --> 01:05:49.359
I really do, but,

01:05:49.393 --> 01:05:50.843
you gotta understand
that we live in a world

01:05:50.877 --> 01:05:53.328
where a lack of respect
for cultural identity

01:05:53.363 --> 01:05:55.813
is stirring up a hornet's nest.

01:05:55.848 --> 01:05:57.470
- I'm not sure
what you're saying.

01:05:57.505 --> 01:05:59.990
- They called her by a
racial slur that marginalizes

01:06:00.025 --> 01:06:01.923
her birth culture.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:06.617
- Mr. Bennett, I think you're
being a little sensitive.

01:06:06.652 --> 01:06:07.756
Jimmie's an American.

01:06:07.791 --> 01:06:09.310
She's always lived here.

01:06:09.344 --> 01:06:11.174
- Not always.

01:06:11.208 --> 01:06:12.520
And that doesn't mean
that she doesn't feel

01:06:12.554 --> 01:06:15.316
or understand the
sting of those words.

01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:17.801
- They also told her
that her real daddy Kumar

01:06:17.835 --> 01:06:21.218
was going to come take
her to live at 7-11.

01:06:21.253 --> 01:06:24.014
- If you don't understand
the girl who's lost

01:06:24.049 --> 01:06:28.363
both of her birth parents and
then her real mother to cancer

01:06:28.398 --> 01:06:30.538
is going to feel real
pain when somebody implies

01:06:30.572 --> 01:06:32.850
that they're gonna take
her away from her family,

01:06:32.885 --> 01:06:36.026
then you don't understand
an eight year old child.

01:06:36.061 --> 01:06:38.442
- Is this true, Donald, Mike?

01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:42.032
- We didn't hit
anybody, she did.

01:06:42.067 --> 01:06:43.965
- Some black kid comes
out of nowhere claiming

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.932
to be her sister, and
then this oriental girl

01:06:45.967 --> 01:06:48.038
starts yelling bad words.

01:06:48.073 --> 01:06:50.420
- It's Asian, you neanderthal.

01:06:50.454 --> 01:06:53.733
- So you're concerned with
Donnie making a childish joke

01:06:53.768 --> 01:06:56.874
about convenience store owners

01:06:56.909 --> 01:06:59.808
but not with this girl
calling our son's names

01:06:59.843 --> 01:07:03.088
after her so-called
sister punched them?

01:07:04.089 --> 01:07:05.090
- So-called?

01:07:06.539 --> 01:07:09.646
If you think Pearl's language
after they use racial slurs

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.407
is somehow more offensive
than your so-called response,

01:07:12.442 --> 01:07:14.306
look, I'm not defending
the violent response

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:16.929
but I will not tolerate anyone

01:07:16.963 --> 01:07:20.415
implying that we are
not a real family.

01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:22.072
- Okay, okay, there
are a lot of feelings

01:07:22.107 --> 01:07:24.488
in this room right
now, but I'm sorry.

01:07:24.523 --> 01:07:27.457
My hands are tied when it
comes to physical violence.

01:07:27.491 --> 01:07:30.011
Toni will be suspended
for two days.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:32.772
And Pearl, one for
their language.

01:07:32.807 --> 01:07:34.947
And Donald and Mike will
be suspended for one day

01:07:34.981 --> 01:07:36.224
as well for their language.

01:07:36.259 --> 01:07:38.537
- Oh come on, suspended?

01:07:38.571 --> 01:07:41.091
- I hope you all
take this opportunity

01:07:41.126 --> 01:07:44.336
to think about the
power of your words.

01:07:45.199 --> 01:07:46.372
I know I will.

01:07:51.688 --> 01:07:53.034
- No, no.

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:56.555
I took a half day to get
my mom to the doctor.

01:07:56.589 --> 01:07:58.108
Yeah.

01:07:58.143 --> 01:08:00.593
Well I let the nanny off and
got Theo and Billie to home.

01:08:00.628 --> 01:08:01.594
Mhmm.

01:08:01.629 --> 01:08:03.631
- No one here seems to recognize

01:08:03.665 --> 01:08:05.943
this is a crisis situation.

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:08.532
- Well mom's taking
the littles to the park

01:08:08.567 --> 01:08:10.120
so I can finish up
some paperwork at home

01:08:10.155 --> 01:08:12.743
before I have to pick
up Frank from robotics,

01:08:12.778 --> 01:08:16.229
Jimmie up from violin and
somebody else from something.

01:08:16.264 --> 01:08:20.819
- I think the FBI's been rooting
through our cabinets again.

01:08:20.854 --> 01:08:22.270
Or maybe the CIA.

01:08:23.444 --> 01:08:25.791
JC Penney, that's the worst.

01:08:27.171 --> 01:08:30.381
- Hey, can you hang on a second?

01:08:30.416 --> 01:08:32.660
Mom, do you need help
finding something?

01:08:32.694 --> 01:08:35.904
- I'm looking for my big
blue gin and tonic cup.

01:08:35.939 --> 01:08:39.839
The small ones just fall
through the sippy cup holders.

01:08:39.874 --> 01:08:42.532
- Do you think it's wise
to drink at the playground?

01:08:42.566 --> 01:08:47.122
- Have you been to the park
this time of day, Susie?

01:08:47.157 --> 01:08:49.332
I don't think it
wise to go sober.

01:08:49.366 --> 01:08:52.576
- Whoah, this is like
mining for diamond armor,

01:08:52.611 --> 01:08:53.750
but smellier.

01:08:53.783 --> 01:08:55.475
- Theo, no, no, no, no, no.

01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:57.202
Why do we have kitty litter?

01:08:57.236 --> 01:08:59.652
- Oh, for the cat, dear.

01:08:59.687 --> 01:09:01.274
Are you losing it?

01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:03.380
- We don't have a cat.

01:09:03.415 --> 01:09:05.417
But yes, I am losing it.

01:09:07.867 --> 01:09:09.593
Yeah, you're right, I admit it.

01:09:09.627 --> 01:09:12.319
Yeah, I'm gonna need you
to rescue me this weekend.

01:09:12.354 --> 01:09:16.393
I don't know, I need a new
hairstyler, a new hobby.

01:09:16.428 --> 01:09:18.118
I don't have enough brainpower

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:20.328
to make a decision either way.

01:09:20.363 --> 01:09:23.883
- Full impact yodel wrestling,
that's a great hobby.

01:09:23.917 --> 01:09:25.575
And as for the hair,

01:09:27.093 --> 01:09:30.131
how about bald with a
tattoo of a chipmunk

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.133
clinging to your scalp?

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:33.376
You're welcome.

01:09:34.584 --> 01:09:37.242
- I just love the wrestlers.

01:09:37.276 --> 01:09:40.037
I think their
uniforms are dishy.

01:09:41.555 --> 01:09:44.076
I think I might call
for cheerleader.

01:09:44.109 --> 01:09:46.457
Hey team, what's that sound?

01:09:46.492 --> 01:09:49.011
Eagles running
prey to the ground!

01:09:49.046 --> 01:09:50.185
Then shake it.

01:09:51.877 --> 01:09:53.015
We shake it.

01:09:53.050 --> 01:09:54.051
- Go grandma.

01:09:54.086 --> 01:09:55.570
- Oh so you agree?

01:09:57.952 --> 01:09:59.333
Hey, uh,

01:09:59.367 --> 01:10:00.679
I gotta let you go.

01:10:00.713 --> 01:10:02.957
Yeah, okay, all right, bye.

01:10:08.583 --> 01:10:09.412
Mom?

01:10:11.862 --> 01:10:14.693
Are you okay to go
to the playground?

01:10:14.727 --> 01:10:17.627
- I'm a good
babysitter Missus, um,

01:10:18.766 --> 01:10:20.181
- Mom?

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:21.147
- Oh Susie.

01:10:22.632 --> 01:10:23.460
I'm okay.

01:10:24.979 --> 01:10:26.394
- You sure?

01:10:26.429 --> 01:10:27.257
- Well,

01:10:28.707 --> 01:10:32.849
I get confused sometimes
with the time and the year

01:10:32.883 --> 01:10:35.507
but they'll be fine with me.

01:10:35.541 --> 01:10:36.818
They ground me.

01:10:37.957 --> 01:10:40.028
When it's just me with them,

01:10:40.063 --> 01:10:42.272
I never get confused.

01:10:42.307 --> 01:10:46.897
Hell, you call them by their
wrong names half the time.

01:10:47.795 --> 01:10:49.037
- You're right.

01:10:50.591 --> 01:10:53.801
You take good care
of your grandbabies.

01:10:56.182 --> 01:10:58.944
- I don't know how
you do it, Susie,

01:10:58.978 --> 01:11:02.879
taking care of all
those babies and me.

01:11:02.913 --> 01:11:05.571
And it means the world to me

01:11:05.606 --> 01:11:08.436
being here with
them and with you.

01:11:09.506 --> 01:11:10.335
- Mom.

01:11:11.681 --> 01:11:12.958
We're a family.

01:11:14.511 --> 01:11:16.513
You belong here with us.

01:11:17.928 --> 01:11:18.757
Come here.

01:11:22.312 --> 01:11:24.694
- You're my favorite
child, you know.

01:11:24.728 --> 01:11:27.248
Don't tell your brother.

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:28.939
- I'm an only child, remember.

01:11:28.974 --> 01:11:32.495
- I'm just pulling
your damn leg.

01:11:32.529 --> 01:11:34.911
Besides, you ruined my uterus,

01:11:34.945 --> 01:11:36.464
tore that place right up.

01:11:36.499 --> 01:11:37.327
- Mom!

01:11:39.087 --> 01:11:42.470
- I'm taking off with
the little beasties now.

01:11:42.505 --> 01:11:44.714
You get your work done.

01:11:44.748 --> 01:11:45.991
- Yeah, I will.

01:11:47.993 --> 01:11:49.960
Get my work done, right.

01:12:02.421 --> 01:12:03.836
- Well you look happy.

01:12:03.871 --> 01:12:06.977
- That is because I am a genius.

01:12:07.012 --> 01:12:09.221
- Well tell that to
your last report card.

01:12:09.255 --> 01:12:11.361
- Please, Grade Point
Averages are big brother's way

01:12:11.396 --> 01:12:13.156
of controlling the masses.

01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:17.505
More importantly, I'm going
to Grammy camp after all.

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:18.713
- What is this?

01:12:18.748 --> 01:12:20.266
- The answer to
all of my problems.

01:12:20.301 --> 01:12:22.993
We can record the performance
in front of a live audience

01:12:23.028 --> 01:12:26.203
and it all goes down three
days before the deadline.

01:12:26.238 --> 01:12:27.377
- Look, Pearl.

01:12:30.138 --> 01:12:32.071
I know you're excited
and you guys are awesome

01:12:32.106 --> 01:12:36.006
but I mean there's a lot
of talent in this state.

01:12:36.041 --> 01:12:38.699
- Yeah but this is my last shot.

01:12:39.838 --> 01:12:42.530
And I have a few
tricks up my sleeve.

01:12:42.565 --> 01:12:44.394
- Oh yeah, like what?

01:12:44.429 --> 01:12:46.258
- You'll see.

01:12:46.292 --> 01:12:47.121
- Okay.

01:12:48.294 --> 01:12:49.779
Well, buckle up.

01:12:49.813 --> 01:12:53.438
We have four minutes to pick
up Frank from Robotics club.

01:12:53.472 --> 01:12:55.094
- Can't we just leave him
with his fellow robots

01:12:55.129 --> 01:12:56.786
where he'll actually be happy?

01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:58.546
- I thought you guys
were getting along.

01:12:58.581 --> 01:13:00.168
- You have to question
the values of someone

01:13:00.203 --> 01:13:01.687
who suddenly respects
you after getting busted

01:13:01.722 --> 01:13:03.379
on school profanity.

01:13:05.346 --> 01:13:06.174
- True.

01:13:14.459 --> 01:13:15.598
- See you guys.

01:13:15.632 --> 01:13:17.116
- Hey, Chris.

01:13:17.151 --> 01:13:18.739
Hey man.

01:13:18.773 --> 01:13:21.189
- So you said you got some
favor to ask, get clothes,

01:13:21.224 --> 01:13:23.847
want more advice about women?

01:13:23.882 --> 01:13:25.297
- Ah no.

01:13:25.331 --> 01:13:27.782
You said you had a friend
who pays top dollar

01:13:27.817 --> 01:13:30.923
sports memorabilla collectibles,
that type of thing.

01:13:30.958 --> 01:13:32.615
- Ah yeah, yeah I do.

01:13:32.649 --> 01:13:33.719
What you got?

01:13:56.397 --> 01:13:58.192
- Hey, you got a minute?

01:13:58.226 --> 01:13:59.504
- Um, yeah sure.

01:14:01.713 --> 01:14:05.302
Not like I'm making any
real progress here anyways.

01:14:05.337 --> 01:14:07.028
- Ah, what's that?

01:14:07.063 --> 01:14:09.168
- We're studying
DNA and identity.

01:14:09.203 --> 01:14:11.101
Part of the project is
examples of dominant

01:14:11.136 --> 01:14:13.690
and recessive factors
we get from our parents.

01:14:13.725 --> 01:14:17.418
And how you're very
related to our siblings.

01:14:20.076 --> 01:14:22.458
- Hm. Sometimes we get
the opportunity

01:14:22.492 --> 01:14:25.046
to educate our teachers.

01:14:25.081 --> 01:14:29.050
How are you planning on
expressing yourself on this?

01:14:29.085 --> 01:14:31.121
- During research on the
majority and minority groups

01:14:31.156 --> 01:14:33.710
in the area of China I'm from,

01:14:33.745 --> 01:14:37.611
which is actually
really fascinating,

01:14:37.645 --> 01:14:39.578
I just can't find the
right words to relate it

01:14:39.613 --> 01:14:41.131
to the assignment.

01:14:44.376 --> 01:14:47.828
- Maybe you'll have some
interesting perspective,

01:14:47.862 --> 01:14:50.106
some nature versus nurture.

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:52.315
- Maybe.

01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:55.491
So what's up?

01:14:57.907 --> 01:14:59.702
- I've been thinking about camp.

01:14:59.736 --> 01:15:03.464
- Look, I understand
with the move and all,

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:04.638
we can't afford it.

01:15:04.672 --> 01:15:05.777
I get it.

01:15:05.811 --> 01:15:06.916
Lot of maths.

01:15:08.055 --> 01:15:10.298
- I know, I know
it's important to you

01:15:10.333 --> 01:15:13.439
but yeah it's been a crazy year.

01:15:13.474 --> 01:15:16.753
- I don't need
lectures on patience.

01:15:16.788 --> 01:15:18.583
This year was different.

01:15:18.617 --> 01:15:21.793
And Tyler freaking Joseph will
be there in New York Week.

01:15:21.827 --> 01:15:23.622
I mean Tyler and Luminous Hearts

01:15:23.657 --> 01:15:25.728
is masterclassing the LA Week.

01:15:25.762 --> 01:15:29.248
I mean those are two of
my biggest influences.

01:15:29.283 --> 01:15:32.769
But seriously, don't
worry about it, okay?

01:15:33.632 --> 01:15:36.083
I'll figure this out myself.

01:15:36.117 --> 01:15:39.120
- First, I'm not
here for a lecture.

01:15:40.501 --> 01:15:42.883
And second, maybe you
don't need to do everything

01:15:42.917 --> 01:15:44.229
all by yourself.

01:15:44.263 --> 01:15:45.644
- Okay, I get it.

01:15:45.679 --> 01:15:47.543
We're all family, yay.

01:15:50.787 --> 01:15:54.308
- I know you weren't
thrilled about,

01:15:54.342 --> 01:15:56.172
you know, all of this.

01:15:59.969 --> 01:16:03.248
I know what it's like
to want something so bad

01:16:03.282 --> 01:16:06.113
that you'd sacrifice your left,

01:16:06.147 --> 01:16:07.563
left hand for it.

01:16:09.703 --> 01:16:12.982
When I was trained
to become WXC champ,

01:16:14.121 --> 01:16:17.434
I sacrificed my day
job, most of my friends

01:16:17.469 --> 01:16:18.953
and my girlfriend.

01:16:20.714 --> 01:16:22.508
- And you won, right?

01:16:22.543 --> 01:16:24.994
That's that big gaudy
belt up at your gym.

01:16:25.028 --> 01:16:25.857
- Yeah.

01:16:26.927 --> 01:16:27.755
It was.

01:16:30.447 --> 01:16:34.106
And now it's here, ready
to follow a new dream.

01:16:34.141 --> 01:16:35.211
- That's not.

01:16:37.282 --> 01:16:39.215
Are you serious?

01:16:39.249 --> 01:16:41.079
But that was your dream.

01:16:41.113 --> 01:16:43.460
- Yeah, and now it's yours.

01:16:43.495 --> 01:16:45.842
I can go visit it
on display in LA

01:16:45.877 --> 01:16:48.431
whenever you become
a big rockstar.

01:16:48.465 --> 01:16:50.467
- No, you can't do this.

01:16:52.055 --> 01:16:54.057
I mean Frank wants
that Robotics kit

01:16:54.092 --> 01:16:55.749
and Miles is probably
going to get early entry

01:16:55.783 --> 01:16:57.820
into MIT next year.

01:16:57.854 --> 01:17:00.374
That belongs to
your kids, not me.

01:17:00.408 --> 01:17:02.894
- Jesus Pearl, you are my kid.

01:17:04.171 --> 01:17:05.966
I mean I know Clive is your dad

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.106
but you're my family too.

01:17:09.694 --> 01:17:11.212
Frank's got a part time job,

01:17:11.247 --> 01:17:14.112
he's won most of
the money he needs.

01:17:14.146 --> 01:17:16.770
Miles has got scholarships.

01:17:16.804 --> 01:17:19.255
- Just because you
married my mother

01:17:19.289 --> 01:17:22.914
doesn't mean you have to
cut off your left, whatever

01:17:22.948 --> 01:17:25.951
to help me or my
brothers and sisters.

01:17:25.986 --> 01:17:29.714
- I didn't marry your
mother and end up

01:17:29.748 --> 01:17:32.682
with the rest of you
guys in the bargain.

01:17:32.717 --> 01:17:36.582
I fell in love with each
and every one of you.

01:17:37.722 --> 01:17:40.690
I fell in love
with the way Emily

01:17:40.725 --> 01:17:45.557
needs to care for everyone as
if her life depended on it.

01:17:45.591 --> 01:17:49.526
I fell in love with
Toni's wit and swagger.

01:17:49.561 --> 01:17:50.458
B's whimsy.

01:17:51.839 --> 01:17:55.256
- Don't suppose
I made that easy.

01:17:55.291 --> 01:17:57.638
- Are you kidding me?

01:17:57.673 --> 01:18:00.296
I can't even decide what moment.

01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:04.680
Maybe a little at
your fearlessness.

01:18:06.095 --> 01:18:10.513
Undoubtedly, standing up
to two racist little punks

01:18:10.547 --> 01:18:12.653
picking on your sister
that you've known

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:14.690
for all of three months.

01:18:16.622 --> 01:18:18.279
But, without a doubt

01:18:20.074 --> 01:18:23.526
the first time I heard
you sing and play.

01:18:26.011 --> 01:18:30.429
Uh, it's like you popped
into existence from stardust

01:18:31.568 --> 01:18:32.708
to create art.

01:18:35.987 --> 01:18:36.815
You're 14.

01:18:38.921 --> 01:18:43.166
And you create magic in
ways I could never imagine.

01:18:50.173 --> 01:18:54.005
I love you Pearl, including
your stubbornness.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.629
And I wanna do this for you

01:18:57.663 --> 01:19:00.425
not because you're
Susan's daughter.

01:19:00.459 --> 01:19:03.669
But because I couldn't
love you any more

01:19:03.704 --> 01:19:06.189
if I would have been
there the moment

01:19:06.224 --> 01:19:07.673
you were created.

01:19:22.067 --> 01:19:23.482
- I love you too.

01:19:25.415 --> 01:19:26.244
- What?

01:19:28.833 --> 01:19:30.075
- You heard me.

01:19:31.836 --> 01:19:33.320
- Okay I think
everyone's been fed.

01:19:33.354 --> 01:19:34.631
Keyboard is loaded.

01:19:34.666 --> 01:19:36.599
- We just finished
loading up the drums.

01:19:36.633 --> 01:19:37.600
You ready, Pearl?

01:19:37.634 --> 01:19:38.601
- No.

01:19:38.635 --> 01:19:40.085
I mean yeah, maybe.

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.604
- You got this, little nugget.

01:19:41.638 --> 01:19:42.743
And we got you.

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:44.089
- Thanks, Dylan.

01:19:45.125 --> 01:19:47.092
Oh Frank, the um,

01:19:47.127 --> 01:19:48.818
yeah, it's fully charged, the
camera's fully charged right

01:19:48.853 --> 01:19:50.026
and you have the storage thingy?

01:19:50.061 --> 01:19:52.373
- Chill, everything's
checked and ready to go.

01:19:52.408 --> 01:19:55.169
- Okay, let's load everyone up.

01:19:56.653 --> 01:19:58.552
Everyone check their
travel buddies.

01:19:58.586 --> 01:20:00.657
- I forgot my travel buddy.

01:20:00.692 --> 01:20:02.521
- I got you buddy, you me and B.

01:20:02.556 --> 01:20:03.384
Let's go.

01:20:11.427 --> 01:20:14.533
- Um, what
is she doing here?

01:20:15.983 --> 01:20:17.951
- I don't know.

01:20:17.985 --> 01:20:20.712
- Lila Jean, this is
my sorority sister,

01:20:20.746 --> 01:20:24.889
Betsy Snowden, the new
CEO of Snowden Meats.

01:20:24.923 --> 01:20:26.304
- It is such a
pleasure to meet you.

01:20:26.338 --> 01:20:27.823
- And you.

01:20:27.857 --> 01:20:29.790
After the show, I have a
few juicy college stories

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:30.998
about your aunt.

01:20:31.033 --> 01:20:33.863
- And, that you
wouldn't dare, actually.

01:20:33.898 --> 01:20:35.175
- On second thought,
you probably have a few

01:20:35.209 --> 01:20:37.073
stories on me as well.

01:20:37.108 --> 01:20:40.421
- This is Paul Deville,
of Deville Real Estate.

01:20:40.456 --> 01:20:43.010
- Charmed, I look forward
to hearing you play.

01:20:43.045 --> 01:20:44.287
- Pleasure's all mine.

01:20:44.322 --> 01:20:46.186
- And he's also a member
of the club with me.

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:47.497
- Oh and I've had the pleasure

01:20:47.532 --> 01:20:49.810
of getting in the way
of her golf slice.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:54.815
- Oh come on, I'm
not that bad.

01:20:55.989 --> 01:20:57.611
Welcome everybody, hi.

01:20:57.645 --> 01:20:59.095
Before we begin,
we're about to start,

01:20:59.130 --> 01:21:01.408
I'd like to ask everyone to
turn off your cellphones please.

01:21:01.442 --> 01:21:04.273
- Do you know if
grandpa's here yet?

01:21:04.307 --> 01:21:07.448
- I don't know mom, are we
saving the seat for G-Pa?

01:21:07.483 --> 01:21:09.450
- Um, I don't know honey.

01:21:09.485 --> 01:21:10.762
- No, he's tucking in.

01:21:10.796 --> 01:21:14.283
He's about a half
hour out still, so.

01:21:14.317 --> 01:21:16.147
- Social media,
texting, nothing.

01:21:16.181 --> 01:21:17.907
Please, no sharing until Friday

01:21:17.942 --> 01:21:20.392
when the show airs on
TV18 White Murdoch Cable.

01:21:20.427 --> 01:21:21.255
Okay?

01:21:22.394 --> 01:21:25.397
And we are going
live in five, four.

01:22:17.415 --> 01:22:18.243
- I think.

01:22:19.106 --> 01:22:20.970
Only two more acts after us, so

01:22:21.005 --> 01:22:24.594
assuming I don't faceplant,
I think we have a good shot.

01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:25.457
Okay.

Are you Dr. Bunsen?

01:22:41.473 --> 01:22:43.372
- Why yes I am, young lady.

01:22:43.406 --> 01:22:45.408
- I loved your show, can
I have your autograph?

01:22:45.443 --> 01:22:46.444
- Well sure.

01:22:48.411 --> 01:22:49.481

01:22:49.516 --> 01:22:50.517

What's your name?

01:22:52.243 --> 01:22:53.037
- Laura.

01:22:56.212 --> 01:22:57.006
- There you go.

01:22:57.041 --> 01:22:57.869
- Thank you.

01:22:57.903 --> 01:22:59.353
- You're welcome.

01:22:59.388 --> 01:23:02.356
But, that's the autograph
you should be getting.

01:23:02.391 --> 01:23:05.325
Pearl Song, she's
my granddaughter.

01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:09.812
- Hi everyone,
hi, it's me again.

01:23:09.846 --> 01:23:11.055
Just a quick note.

01:23:11.089 --> 01:23:12.263
I've been informed
that our next act

01:23:12.297 --> 01:23:13.919
has a change in name.

01:23:13.954 --> 01:23:15.956

Guys, I'm still freaking
out from our performance.

I mean, did you see
that standing ovation?

01:28:19.397 --> 01:28:20.847
I seriously think we've got this

01:28:20.881 --> 01:28:23.539

these next two acts

01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:02.051

of meats for the whole
family from Snowden Meats.

01:30:15.996 --> 01:30:18.447
Second place goes to,

01:30:18.482 --> 01:30:19.828
uh I could puke.

01:30:22.106 --> 01:30:24.108
The United Colors
of Bennet Song.

01:30:30.735 --> 01:30:32.565
And our big winner is,

01:30:33.911 --> 01:30:35.878
Miss Lila Jane.

01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:42.229
Great job everybody.

01:30:42.264 --> 01:30:43.472
One more round of applause
for our big winners.

01:30:58.073 --> 01:30:59.246
- Sorry, sweety.

01:30:59.281 --> 01:31:00.903
You guys were awesome.

01:31:00.938 --> 01:31:02.387
- You were great.

01:31:04.666 --> 01:31:07.289
- You really were extraordinary.

01:31:07.323 --> 01:31:08.463
- You got my vote, kiddo.

01:31:08.497 --> 01:31:10.326
Keep up the good work.

01:31:11.224 --> 01:31:12.225
- Very nice.

01:31:16.401 --> 01:31:17.713
- Mr. Bennett, a word please.

01:31:17.748 --> 01:31:18.956
- Sure.

01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:20.198
- This is Paul Deville,
he's one of the judges

01:31:20.233 --> 01:31:21.855
of the talent show.

01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:23.408
- Mr. Bennett, it's been
brought to our attention

01:31:23.443 --> 01:31:26.446
that this young man videotaped
portions of the show.

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:28.413
- Yeah, what's the problem?

01:31:28.448 --> 01:31:30.519
- Well the application
of programs stipulate

01:31:30.554 --> 01:31:33.798
that the show or results
couldn't be taped

01:31:33.833 --> 01:31:35.697
without permission
from the committee.

01:31:35.731 --> 01:31:37.077
Due to the risk
that it would air

01:31:37.112 --> 01:31:39.252
before the actual TV debut.

01:31:39.286 --> 01:31:41.254
- But other parents were taping.

01:31:41.288 --> 01:31:42.704
- Well I don't know
about any others

01:31:42.738 --> 01:31:46.328
but I'm afraid we're gonna
have to confiscate the drive.

01:31:46.362 --> 01:31:48.951
You can file the paperwork
online today for clearance.

01:31:48.986 --> 01:31:50.643
- What, can we do
it here and now?

01:31:50.677 --> 01:31:52.576
- We don't have
any of the paperwork here.

01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:55.544
- No, I need that footage
edited two days from now.

01:31:55.579 --> 01:31:57.822
We won't post it
anywhere, I swear.

01:31:57.857 --> 01:31:59.721
- I can't do anything.

01:31:59.755 --> 01:32:00.756
- Mom?

01:32:00.791 --> 01:32:02.206
- Oh my god.

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:04.173
- Stevie, I can personally
deliver the form to you tonight.

01:32:04.208 --> 01:32:06.831
Can we, I mean surely you
can provide that clearance.

01:32:06.866 --> 01:32:09.282
- I can't tonight, I'm sorry.

01:32:14.839 --> 01:32:16.427
- Dylan will you
help me with my keyboard?

01:32:16.461 --> 01:32:19.395
- Sure girl, let's go.

01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:21.328
- What are we gonna do?

01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:41.279
- Well, there's my
little rockstar.

01:32:43.558 --> 01:32:45.870
And up by the crack of noon.

01:32:47.803 --> 01:32:49.218
- It's spring break.

01:32:49.253 --> 01:32:51.186
You're lucky the sun's still up.

01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:53.913
- Ah, to be a teenager.

01:32:54.258 --> 01:32:58.883
You know, I'm very proud
of what you did yesterday.

01:33:01.368 --> 01:33:02.473
- But I lost.

01:33:04.648 --> 01:33:06.615
And I needed that money.

01:33:06.650 --> 01:33:09.204
Even more, I needed that video.

01:33:09.238 --> 01:33:12.828
- Well I suppose you
could look at it that way.

01:33:12.863 --> 01:33:15.969
But you created
art out of thin air

01:33:16.004 --> 01:33:19.559
and you did it with
people you love.

01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:20.422
- Yeah.

01:33:22.355 --> 01:33:25.600
I get it, process is more
important than the result.

01:33:25.634 --> 01:33:26.428
- Pearl?

01:33:28.154 --> 01:33:28.982
Pearl.

01:33:30.674 --> 01:33:33.815
Art gives a voice
to the voiceless.

01:33:33.849 --> 01:33:37.646
It opens minds and hearts
to progress and healing.

01:33:37.681 --> 01:33:39.614
It inspires, it unites.

01:33:41.857 --> 01:33:44.377
We need our stories, our songs

01:33:45.516 --> 01:33:48.174
to help us through tough times.

01:33:48.208 --> 01:33:50.486
Just as we need our
family to lean on

01:33:50.521 --> 01:33:51.867
when times are tough.

01:33:51.902 --> 01:33:54.974
And guess what,
kiddo, you have both.

01:33:57.493 --> 01:34:00.600
- Yeah but, all I
did was write a song

01:34:02.567 --> 01:34:03.810
and perform it.

01:34:05.191 --> 01:34:07.883
At a talent show which I lost.

01:34:07.918 --> 01:34:09.920
- Hello, earth to Pearl.

01:34:11.991 --> 01:34:16.443
Have you heard anything
I've been saying here?

01:34:16.478 --> 01:34:17.306
Pearl.

01:34:18.549 --> 01:34:20.275
You did so much more.

01:34:22.795 --> 01:34:25.556
My show was on for a long time.

01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:26.591
It still is.

01:34:27.489 --> 01:34:29.629
And many people thing Dr. Bunsen

01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:31.527
was all fluff.

01:34:31.562 --> 01:34:32.563
Not to kids.

01:34:33.978 --> 01:34:38.051
To the kids, I was the voice
of support and authority.

01:34:38.086 --> 01:34:40.916
A kind adult with answers.

01:34:40.951 --> 01:34:42.815
I made a difference.

01:34:42.849 --> 01:34:44.092
And so can you.

01:34:49.062 --> 01:34:52.065
- I never really
thought about that.

01:34:53.273 --> 01:34:55.897
But I mean I can see
that in your fans.

01:34:55.931 --> 01:34:58.658
- Hey, if I spend
the rest of my days

01:34:58.693 --> 01:35:03.628
doing community theater or the
occasional bedpan commercial,

01:35:04.768 --> 01:35:06.977
I'll still be taking my
audience on a journey

01:35:07.011 --> 01:35:10.014
because it's not about
winning or losing.

01:35:10.049 --> 01:35:14.087
It's about making something
that didn't exist before

01:35:14.122 --> 01:35:16.193
mean something to others.

01:35:17.056 --> 01:35:19.990
It's about sharing our dreams,

01:35:20.024 --> 01:35:22.475
our songs, with our audience.

01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:28.274
- Thanks, Sam.

01:35:30.966 --> 01:35:31.795
G-Pa.

01:35:33.762 --> 01:35:35.833
- It's all in a day's work.

01:35:35.868 --> 01:35:37.628
Now if you'll excuse me.

01:35:37.662 --> 01:35:39.423
I have an appointment to
help your brother Patrick

01:35:39.457 --> 01:35:40.700
with a dilemma.

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:41.908
It seems that he's got
a crush on a brunette

01:35:41.943 --> 01:35:44.014
cutie at school.

01:35:44.048 --> 01:35:47.327
- I don't have a
brother named Patrick.

01:35:50.503 --> 01:35:51.953
- Are you sure?

01:35:51.987 --> 01:35:53.506
- I'm pretty sure.

01:35:54.610 --> 01:35:55.439
- Really?

01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:58.822
Blonde curly headed, 16.

01:35:59.754 --> 01:36:01.203
Usually wears a ballcap.

01:36:01.238 --> 01:36:04.966
- That's Patrick King, he
lives like a block over.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.381
- He's not my grandson?

01:36:06.415 --> 01:36:07.244
- No.

01:36:09.039 --> 01:36:10.350
- Oh well.

01:36:10.385 --> 01:36:12.145
Chase is always on the case.

01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:14.009
I go where I'm needed.

01:36:27.195 --> 01:36:29.784
- Excuse
me, Mrs. Bennett.

01:36:29.818 --> 01:36:31.440
- It's Doctor, actually.

01:36:31.475 --> 01:36:33.097
Dr. Bennett-Song.

01:36:33.132 --> 01:36:34.650
- Okay.

01:36:34.685 --> 01:36:37.170
Look, I went through a lot of
trouble to get you this file.

01:36:37.205 --> 01:36:38.758
- It's been three days.

01:36:38.793 --> 01:36:41.209
Did you get my text, my emails?

01:36:41.243 --> 01:36:42.900
- You should be thanking me.

01:36:42.935 --> 01:36:44.143
- I'm sure.

01:36:44.177 --> 01:36:46.145
And this would have
been great yesterday.

01:36:46.179 --> 01:36:48.009
Before today's
delivery deadline.

01:36:48.043 --> 01:36:51.598
- Look, I know we haven't
gotten along on the best foot.

01:36:51.633 --> 01:36:53.186
But I'm on my way to
the mayor's right now

01:36:53.221 --> 01:36:55.395
to speak to him about
the noise ordinance.

01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:57.121
We don't run
halfway houses here.

01:36:57.156 --> 01:36:59.537
- Whoah, I'm sorry, did
you just call my family

01:36:59.572 --> 01:37:00.745
a halfway house?

01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:01.954
- I didn't mean it like that.

01:37:01.988 --> 01:37:03.472
- No, no, did you?

01:37:03.507 --> 01:37:05.958
- Did you say you're going
to the mayor right now?

01:37:05.992 --> 01:37:07.476
- Yeah I have a private meeting.

01:37:07.511 --> 01:37:08.684
- You know what, you're right.

01:37:08.719 --> 01:37:10.100
We did get off on the wrong foot

01:37:10.134 --> 01:37:12.827
and we're going to try
to be better neighbors.

01:37:12.861 --> 01:37:15.933
But um, it's quite
the scorcher today.

01:37:15.968 --> 01:37:17.279
Could I send you off with a cup

01:37:17.314 --> 01:37:20.593
of the Bennett's
famous blackberry tea?

01:37:20.627 --> 01:37:22.215
- Yeah, that'll be lovely.

01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:23.768
- Cool, all right.

01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:37.230
- Hey Pearl, come
here for a sec.

01:37:37.265 --> 01:37:38.266
- I'm not gonna step in a nut

01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:40.095
and get shipped to Burma, am I?

01:37:40.130 --> 01:37:41.338
- Don't give me any ideas.

01:37:41.372 --> 01:37:43.236
I just wanna show you something.

01:37:43.271 --> 01:37:45.652
- You've hacked NOAH
and don't want my help

01:37:45.687 --> 01:37:48.276
stopping global
thermonuclear war?

01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:52.211
- Again with the
ideas, just come here.

01:37:52.245 --> 01:37:53.937
- All right.

01:37:53.971 --> 01:37:55.490
- Well you know how you
told me to upload your video

01:37:55.524 --> 01:37:56.525
a month ago?

01:37:58.044 --> 01:38:00.391
- I haven't watched
it lately, but sure.

01:38:00.426 --> 01:38:02.635
- Well I did a little
demographic research

01:38:02.669 --> 01:38:05.431
and developed my own algorithms.

01:38:05.465 --> 01:38:06.708
And watch this.

01:38:10.436 --> 01:38:12.231
♪ We are stars

01:38:12.265 --> 01:38:13.094
- Wait.

01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:16.649
Wait.

01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:21.447
That's, that can't be right.

01:38:21.481 --> 01:38:22.551
- It's right.

01:38:24.001 --> 01:38:27.591
- That's six million
views, Frank.

01:38:27.625 --> 01:38:29.869
- Look, that's not all.
- Oh my god!

01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:32.078
- I'm not finished yet.

01:38:32.113 --> 01:38:33.459
Once it hit a million views,

01:38:33.493 --> 01:38:35.219
I was able to sell ad space

01:38:35.254 --> 01:38:39.603
and as of this morning, we
have made, 2,435 dollars.

01:38:43.262 --> 01:38:44.125
- What?

01:38:45.436 --> 01:38:46.851
- Yeah, without even
selling dad's belt

01:38:46.886 --> 01:38:48.957
you could still afford
to pay for your camp.

01:38:48.992 --> 01:38:50.648
- But it's too late.

01:38:52.029 --> 01:38:53.272
With my band out of town,

01:38:53.306 --> 01:38:54.618
I have to send them
some lame solo tape

01:38:54.652 --> 01:38:56.585
and I didn't get accepted.

01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:58.933
- Sorry, I didn't know.

01:38:58.967 --> 01:39:00.865
- Do you realize
what you've done?

01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:02.833
A camp doesn't even...

01:39:02.867 --> 01:39:06.699
You put my music in the ears
of six million people, Frank.

01:39:06.733 --> 01:39:08.494
That's amazing.

01:39:08.528 --> 01:39:11.704
And you keep the
money, all right.

01:39:11.738 --> 01:39:13.361
I have 11 months till next year

01:39:13.395 --> 01:39:18.159
and apparently, six
million new fans.

01:39:18.573 --> 01:39:20.333
- That's not the end of it.

01:39:20.368 --> 01:39:22.232
- How can this day
get any better?

01:39:22.266 --> 01:39:27.030
- Well, I got this email from
the Sunshine Maddox Show.

01:39:27.064 --> 01:39:28.169
- What?

01:39:28.203 --> 01:39:29.204
- Read this.

01:39:30.654 --> 01:39:34.002
- Dear Mr. Bennett, we at
the Sunshine in the Morning

01:39:34.037 --> 01:39:35.866
blah blah blah.

01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:37.695
We loved your video and
would like your band

01:39:37.730 --> 01:39:42.735
and family to appear on the
show in the next few weeks?

01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:44.530
Oh my gosh, Frank!

01:39:44.564 --> 01:39:46.394
Dude, this is amazing!

01:39:49.466 --> 01:39:50.605
Frank?

01:39:50.639 --> 01:39:51.882
- Yeah?

01:39:51.916 --> 01:39:54.747
- Two things, one,
thank you so much.

01:39:56.093 --> 01:39:57.577
- You're welcome.

01:39:57.612 --> 01:40:01.926
- And two, please don't
tell anyone I hugged you.

01:40:01.961 --> 01:40:03.204
- Not a chance.

01:40:07.967 --> 01:40:10.280
- Yes, yes I have been, but,

01:40:11.626 --> 01:40:12.454
well no.

01:40:13.386 --> 01:40:14.215
I mean,

01:40:16.562 --> 01:40:17.390
what?

01:40:19.358 --> 01:40:20.635
- Hey, babe.

01:40:20.669 --> 01:40:22.568
Everybody's in the
car, you ready to go?

01:40:22.602 --> 01:40:24.225
- I'll be there in a second.

01:40:24.259 --> 01:40:25.088
- Okay.

01:40:29.885 --> 01:40:31.128
- Are you sure?

01:40:33.924 --> 01:40:34.752
Okay.

01:40:36.168 --> 01:40:37.617
I'm leaving town.

01:40:41.414 --> 01:40:43.485
I'll see you on Thursday.

01:41:13.101 --> 01:41:14.999
- Weren't they amazing!

01:41:20.453 --> 01:41:23.215
So we heard before that
astounding performance

01:41:23.249 --> 01:41:26.494
just how this lovely
family came to be.

01:41:26.528 --> 01:41:30.049
And I hear that you
wrote that song.

01:41:30.084 --> 01:41:31.775
And I hear that you've written
several, is that right?

01:41:31.809 --> 01:41:34.985
- Yes ma'am, I've
written quite a few.

01:41:35.019 --> 01:41:36.262
- Well that's impressive.

01:41:36.297 --> 01:41:38.437
And you wanna be a
singer-songwriter?

01:41:38.471 --> 01:41:40.818
- Absolutely, but I, well,

01:41:40.853 --> 01:41:42.441
wewouldn't be
here if it weren't

01:41:42.475 --> 01:41:44.201
for my computer-wiz brother.

01:41:44.236 --> 01:41:47.066
- Ah, so you're the reason.

01:41:47.101 --> 01:41:49.586
Well, you and your sister
must be very close.

01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:54.004
- No, we actually didn't
get along at first.

01:41:54.038 --> 01:41:57.904
- Oh, well that's not
what I was expecting.

01:41:57.939 --> 01:41:59.251
- Oh no, but she's okay now.

01:41:59.285 --> 01:42:00.286
She stood up for
my little sister

01:42:00.321 --> 01:42:01.874
and called some bully--

01:42:01.908 --> 01:42:06.016
- I don't think we need to
hear that story here today.

01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:08.536
- Well this family
is full of surprises.

01:42:08.570 --> 01:42:10.883
And we love surprises here
at Sunshine in the Morning,

01:42:10.917 --> 01:42:12.402
don't we audience?

01:42:15.129 --> 01:42:18.166
Well first we heard that
transportation is a challenge.

01:42:18.201 --> 01:42:22.446
So back home, we have two
vans with seating for 18.

01:42:27.279 --> 01:42:29.212
And all Pearl could talk
about was her brother's

01:42:29.246 --> 01:42:31.938
incredible software invention.

01:42:31.973 --> 01:42:36.667
So with her help, we have
an offer from JQ Robotics

01:42:36.702 --> 01:42:39.014
for an internship
working with the company

01:42:39.049 --> 01:42:42.708
to develop his software
to launch worldwide.

01:42:44.088 --> 01:42:46.988
- That's amazing, thank you!

01:42:47.022 --> 01:42:49.542
- Now I understand that
you have one in college

01:42:49.577 --> 01:42:52.925
and seven more in the next
six years, is that right?

01:42:52.959 --> 01:42:54.237
- Um, I haven't,

01:42:55.962 --> 01:42:58.655
I haven't done
that math just yet.

01:42:58.689 --> 01:43:02.624
- Well, one of our sponsors,
Freeman International Textiles

01:43:02.659 --> 01:43:05.282
would like to hire you
for a series of ads

01:43:05.317 --> 01:43:07.491
for their international
inspired clothing line,

01:43:07.526 --> 01:43:09.044
Gypsy Chic.

01:43:09.079 --> 01:43:10.736
And they'd like to pay you

01:43:10.770 --> 01:43:13.911
with a 150,000
dollar college fund.

01:43:18.053 --> 01:43:20.849
So now besides
all the tech help,

01:43:20.884 --> 01:43:22.989
we do know that this
all started with a dream

01:43:23.024 --> 01:43:24.715
of a 14 year old girl.

01:43:24.750 --> 01:43:25.854
Is that right?

01:43:25.889 --> 01:43:27.201
- Well 15 now.

01:43:27.235 --> 01:43:29.962
And I did originally for
a spot at Grammy camp

01:43:29.996 --> 01:43:33.655
but I mean, this is the
best day of my life.

01:43:35.381 --> 01:43:38.246
- Mom, do you have what
we asked you to bring?

01:43:38.281 --> 01:43:39.247
- I sure do.

01:43:43.078 --> 01:43:45.805
- So we made a call to
a few of our friends

01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:48.291
and we shared your video.

01:43:48.325 --> 01:43:50.983
And when your family
flies home in two days,

01:43:51.017 --> 01:43:53.123
you'll be staying
here in New York

01:43:53.157 --> 01:43:55.194
to begin your
first week of camp.

01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:57.300
- Dude, are you for real?

01:43:58.162 --> 01:43:59.681
Oh God!

01:43:59.716 --> 01:44:02.477
- Well we just love
surprises, right audience?

01:44:02.512 --> 01:44:04.307
Now I'd just like to take
this moment to thank

01:44:04.341 --> 01:44:07.724
the lovely United Colors
of Bennett Song and Family

01:44:07.758 --> 01:44:11.037
for gracing our stage
with their talents today.

01:44:11.072 --> 01:44:13.350
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.

01:44:13.385 --> 01:44:17.251
We have one more gift for
you from one of our sponsors.

01:44:17.285 --> 01:44:19.356
- Okay, I get this one.

01:44:19.391 --> 01:44:22.566
A private jet for our
family to fly around on.

01:44:22.601 --> 01:44:24.119
Yeah, yeah, right?

01:44:24.982 --> 01:44:27.088
- No, this is a tiny one.

01:44:28.192 --> 01:44:32.024
We have a 2,000 dollar gift card

01:44:32.058 --> 01:44:35.372
from Blushing Babies
Furniture and more.

01:44:36.891 --> 01:44:37.719
- Um.

01:44:39.859 --> 01:44:43.622
Our, our youngest is four?

01:44:43.794 --> 01:44:45.313
I mean thank you.

01:44:45.348 --> 01:44:48.040
But I don't even really see how.

01:44:48.868 --> 01:44:53.287
Oh, unless you...

01:44:59.672 --> 01:45:02.123
- You're gonna be a
big sister, Billie.

01:45:02.157 --> 01:45:03.987
- I am, I'll be
a good big sister

01:45:04.021 --> 01:45:05.333
just like Pearl.

01:45:07.231 --> 01:45:09.130
- Yes you will.

01:45:11.166 --> 01:45:15.757
Oh, I got an A in
my science project.

01:45:15.964 --> 01:45:19.416
But honestly I can't
say I know a whole lot

01:45:19.451 --> 01:45:23.386
about DNA and how it
shapes our identity.

01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:25.319
I do agree with my
teacher that it's hard

01:45:25.353 --> 01:45:26.906
to look at families
and be able to argue

01:45:26.941 --> 01:45:29.392
against some higher
power at work.

01:45:29.426 --> 01:45:31.946
But it can't all be chemistry.

01:45:33.706 --> 01:45:37.089
Science may eventually come
up with all the explanations.

01:45:37.123 --> 01:45:40.403
But that doesn't deny the
existence of

01:45:40.437 --> 01:45:42.474
miracles in my book.

01:45:43.716 --> 01:45:45.718
Most of my classmates
focused on their eyes,

01:45:45.753 --> 01:45:47.410
ears, noses, mouths,

01:45:48.618 --> 01:45:50.240
in showing how their
identity was carved

01:45:50.274 --> 01:45:52.829
from generations of family DNA.

01:45:54.831 --> 01:45:59.422
My biological parents gave
me the greatest gift of all.

01:46:00.388 --> 01:46:03.667
What I got from their
sacrifice is this...

01:46:03.702 --> 01:46:05.117
- Do we have a cat?

01:46:05.151 --> 01:46:09.880
- Crazy, chaotic miracle
of love that is my family.

01:46:11.434 --> 01:46:13.988
There's no denying
that wherever I go

01:46:14.022 --> 01:46:17.232
and whatever I
create in this world,

01:46:17.267 --> 01:46:20.408
they are the biggest
part of who I am.
