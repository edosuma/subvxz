00:20.500 --> 00:22.625
Hey, hey, hey, hey,slow it down.

00:26.583 --> 00:28.458
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Andrews.

00:28.541 --> 00:30.166
Mr. and Mrs. Baldwin.

00:30.208 --> 00:32.250
Dear Lieutenant and Mrs. Franks.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.041
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Peterson.

00:34.125 --> 00:35.875
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Lupo.

00:35.875 --> 00:39.041
I'm sure you've never received a letter of this nature before,

00:39.083 --> 00:40.833
and I'm also quite sure you'll be surprised

00:40.875 --> 00:44.208
by the circumstances under which I'm writing it.

00:44.250 --> 00:47.041
My name is Alex Chivescu, and I'm a junior,

00:47.083 --> 00:49.833
soon to be a senior at Eagle Creek High School

00:49.875 --> 00:51.875
in Rochester Hills.

00:56.708 --> 01:00.083
My parents moved to Michigan to go to college here,

01:00.125 --> 01:01.541
they divorced when I was 2 years old

01:01.583 --> 01:04.625
and I have not heard from my father since.

01:04.708 --> 01:06.916
My mother is a nurturing and caring person

01:06.958 --> 01:10.500
who inspired my love of learning.

01:10.541 --> 01:12.166
This paper saysyou're a Doctor.

01:12.208 --> 01:16.708
Well sort of, this is morethan a piece of paper Alex,

01:16.750 --> 01:18.666
this is why I cameto this country.

01:18.708 --> 01:20.375
It's why I've studiedso hard.

01:20.416 --> 01:23.958
Education is like a magic keyto open any door,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.541
with it anything is possible.

01:26.625 --> 01:29.791
Can I go to a schoollike this someday too?

01:29.875 --> 01:32.375
Absolutely, absolutely.

01:32.416 --> 01:37.041
You're education is goingto be even better than mine,

01:37.083 --> 01:41.541
you'll go to a great universitylike Harvard.

01:41.583 --> 01:43.166
Is Harvard the best?

01:43.208 --> 01:44.583
The very best.

01:44.625 --> 01:46.041
Then that's where I'll go.

01:46.083 --> 01:47.291
You'll have to work hard.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.500
I will, I promise.

01:49.541 --> 01:51.916
You'll see.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.500
You make me so proud.

01:55.541 --> 01:56.958
So proud.

02:16.041 --> 02:18.083
Perfect, what do you think?

02:18.166 --> 02:20.000
I think I want one too.

02:20.041 --> 02:22.208
You can get a headstart on that,

02:22.250 --> 02:24.625
you do your homeworkwhile I make us some dinner.

02:24.708 --> 02:25.416
Okay.

02:25.458 --> 02:26.833
Okay.

02:29.291 --> 02:30.208
You hungry?

02:30.291 --> 02:31.583
Yes, I'm starving.

02:31.583 --> 02:32.958
Good.

02:43.875 --> 02:46.666
Um, my teacher said you wantedto see me Mrs. Thomas?ing.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.875
Yes Alex, you know yourmother's friend Miss Carson?

02:49.916 --> 02:50.666
Hi Miss Carson.

02:50.708 --> 02:53.833

02:59.125 --> 03:03.458

03:05.958 --> 03:10.166

She's in the hospital.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.541
But she's got good doctorstaking car of her

03:14.625 --> 03:17.750
and I'm sure she'sgoing to be fine.

Okay, goodnight.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.416
Of course I can, honey.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.875
It's going to be okay, Alex,you'll see.

04:30.208 --> 04:35.750
Okay, I bought some groceries,made soup and casseroles;

04:35.833 --> 04:37.250
you won't have to cookfor a while.

04:37.291 --> 04:39.583
Oh, thanks Ellen,you've been so helpful,

04:39.666 --> 04:41.875
especially with Alex.

04:41.916 --> 04:43.375
Here, have a seat.

04:43.416 --> 04:44.958
Alright.

04:48.958 --> 04:51.583
Would you like me to staywith you and Alex tonight?

04:51.666 --> 04:52.625
No, we're fine.

04:52.708 --> 04:54.000
You sure?

04:54.041 --> 04:56.416
It's okay.

04:56.416 --> 04:58.791
You be a good boy and takecar of your mom.

04:58.875 --> 05:00.458
It's okay.I will.

05:02.875 --> 05:03.750
You know what?

05:03.791 --> 05:05.666
I'm going to make yousome tea before I go.

05:05.708 --> 05:06.791
Want to help me, Alex?

05:06.833 --> 05:09.041
Sure.

05:22.916 --> 05:25.208
My mother suffered a serious head injury

05:25.291 --> 05:28.958
from a car accident and developed Bi-Polar Disorder.

05:29.041 --> 05:31.708
When she was on her medication she was able to work

05:31.708 --> 05:35.416
as a professor and things were mostly normal.

05:35.458 --> 05:39.625
But the medication had harsh side effects.

05:39.708 --> 05:42.708
The drugs made it harder for her to think clearly.

05:42.750 --> 05:44.708
Mom, I'm home.

05:44.750 --> 05:48.541
She hated that so she stopped taking them.

05:48.625 --> 05:49.500
Mom?

05:49.541 --> 05:51.083
Then she spiraled down, couldn't work,

05:51.083 --> 05:53.375
and became neglectful and abusive.

05:53.458 --> 05:55.625
Then she spiraled down,Mom, I got my report card.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.916
Are you okay?

06:04.958 --> 06:09.916
I have a headache Alex,leave me alone.

06:09.916 --> 06:11.875
Okay.

06:14.750 --> 06:18.375
I'll leave it here so you Alex,can sign it later.lone.

06:37.833 --> 06:39.833
Have a seat, Alex.

06:43.416 --> 06:45.833
Your mom had to go backto the hospital.

06:45.875 --> 06:46.666
What?

06:46.708 --> 06:47.708
What happened?

06:47.791 --> 06:49.875
She just had a little setback,

06:49.916 --> 06:52.166
but the doctors are takingreally good care of her

06:52.208 --> 06:54.666
and she'll be homeas soon as possible.

06:54.708 --> 06:57.458
Now this is Mrs. Edenger.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.375
Hi.

06:58.416 --> 07:00.583
Hello Alex,nice to meet you.

07:00.666 --> 07:02.208
Nice to meet you too.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.083
I'm from Child ProtectiveServices.

07:04.125 --> 07:05.708
Do you know what that is?

07:05.750 --> 07:08.916
Well, we find nice peopleto take care of children

07:08.958 --> 07:12.833
when their parents can't.

07:12.875 --> 07:15.541
So while your momis in the hospital

07:15.583 --> 07:18.583
you'll stay with a familythat lives near here.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.083
Why can't I staywith Miss Carson?

07:23.083 --> 07:24.541
Well, she won't be ableto take care of you

07:24.625 --> 07:25.916
Why can't I sfor as long as yourwith Miss Carmom is going to be

07:26.000 --> 07:27.875
in the hospital this time.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.708
See this isn't so bad.

07:36.791 --> 07:38.083
Please don't make mestay here.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.375
It's just for a few weeks untilyour mom gets better, okay?

07:41.458 --> 07:42.333
Please don't make me!

07:42.375 --> 07:45.375
Alex, I need you to bea big boy.

07:45.458 --> 07:48.458
Let's just sit downright here.

07:48.541 --> 07:52.500
I've got to go talkto your foster mom.

07:52.541 --> 07:55.541
Maybe you can unpackyour suitcase.

08:03.583 --> 08:10.125
I'll come check on yousometime next week, okay?

08:10.166 --> 08:12.500
It's going to be okay,Alex.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.083
When my mother was taken away from me

08:25.125 --> 08:27.708
I felt alone, abandoned,

08:27.708 --> 08:31.750
and I was terrified that I would never see her again.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.541
I will never forget the first time

08:33.625 --> 08:37.207
I was put in a strange home with people I didn't' know.

08:37.291 --> 08:39.207
Days felt like weeks,

08:39.250 --> 08:43.291
a month without my mom felt like a lifetime.

08:43.375 --> 08:45.208
Mom!

08:46.541 --> 08:48.291
Please don't leave meagain mom.

08:48.375 --> 08:50.208
Please!

08:50.250 --> 08:52.583
I'll try not to.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.583
I'll do my best,okay?

08:54.625 --> 08:58.041
There were times when my mother returned from the hospital

08:58.125 --> 09:00.583
that I thought I had my life back,

09:00.666 --> 09:02.875
but it never lasted for long.

09:02.958 --> 09:05.875
Mom come on,it's Christmas!

09:09.416 --> 09:11.708
Mom come on!

09:11.750 --> 09:13.541
Mom!

09:15.750 --> 09:18.875
Mom?

09:18.916 --> 09:21.000
Can you leave mealone please?

09:21.041 --> 09:23.708
But it's Christmas mom.

09:23.750 --> 09:26.041
I have a present for you.

09:26.125 --> 09:27.750
I made it myself.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.458
Please not now.

09:37.208 --> 09:40.083
My mother struggled constantly with the symptoms

09:40.166 --> 09:41.375
of her condition

09:41.375 --> 09:44.833
and the harsh side effects of the drugs she had to take.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.708
Even when I was home with my mom

09:46.750 --> 09:51.041
it often felt like she wasn't really there.

10:02.875 --> 10:05.041
Mom.

10:05.125 --> 10:05.875
Mom?

10:05.958 --> 10:07.416
Can't you see I'm lookingfor a job?

10:07.500 --> 10:09.500
I need some lunch money.

10:09.541 --> 10:11.333
Your lunch is supposedto be free.

10:11.375 --> 10:14.708
You didn't fill out that paperI brought home from school.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.875
I can't get free lunchuntil you do that.

10:16.958 --> 10:17.958
I'll do it later.

10:18.041 --> 10:20.083
What about lunch today?

10:27.541 --> 10:28.083
There!

10:28.166 --> 10:29.041
That's all I can do!

10:29.125 --> 10:32.500
I don't have a job,I don't have money!

10:41.416 --> 10:43.041
There was never enough money,

10:43.041 --> 10:45.416
and I always worried that we'd have enough food

10:45.458 --> 10:50.500
or that my mom would be able to pay our rent.

10:50.541 --> 10:55.375
It wasn't easy, but I learned to fend for myself.

11:04.791 --> 11:05.750
Open this door!

11:05.833 --> 11:06.750
Do you hear me?

11:06.833 --> 11:07.916
This is what I get for taking care of you

11:07.958 --> 11:11.000
and feeding you, devoting my life to you?!

11:11.041 --> 11:12.000
I pay the rent here!

11:12.041 --> 11:14.208
You open this door right now!

11:14.250 --> 11:15.500
I'm going to kick it in, Alex.

11:15.541 --> 11:17.125
If you don't open this door right now

11:17.166 --> 11:19.208
you're going to be so sorry!

11:19.208 --> 11:19.708
Hey!

11:19.791 --> 11:20.541
you'[pounding on door]sorry!

11:20.625 --> 11:23.416
Hey, what's going on in there?

11:23.458 --> 11:24.458
What?

11:24.541 --> 11:27.250
Look lady, how many times doI have to come down here?

11:27.333 --> 11:30.791
If you don't keep it downI'm going to call the police.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.291
You don't have to do this,let me go back to my apartment.

11:35.375 --> 11:39.708
I'll--I'll calm down,I'll be fine, okay?

11:39.708 --> 11:43.791
Just let me...

11:43.875 --> 11:47.041
I don't want to go,I--I--I can't do this.

11:47.041 --> 11:49.000
I'll be okay.

11:49.041 --> 11:53.125
Oh, there's my son,don't put in front of him.

11:58.083 --> 12:01.041
My mother was taken away from me many times,

12:01.083 --> 12:03.958
sometimes my mom was taken away for weeks,

12:04.041 --> 12:06.208
other times for months.

12:06.250 --> 12:08.916
She'd be hospitalized and put on medication

12:08.958 --> 12:12.416
and I'd end up living with strangers again.

12:12.458 --> 12:15.083
After a while she'd return to stability

12:15.125 --> 12:17.416
and I'd be placed back in her care,

12:17.500 --> 12:20.541
but it always felt precarious.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.541
I lived in fear

12:23.583 --> 12:27.125
because I knew a life with my mother could never last,

12:27.208 --> 12:30.333
before long she'd go off her medication

12:30.375 --> 12:34.791
and everything would fall apart again.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.541
I felt bad for my mom

12:36.583 --> 12:38.708
because she couldn't take care of herself

12:38.750 --> 12:44.416
let alone take care of me.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.958
When I was 16

12:46.000 --> 12:47.291
I left my latest foster home

12:47.333 --> 12:49.750
and returned to live with my mother.

12:49.791 --> 12:52.458
Fortunately for me our apartment was located

12:52.541 --> 12:55.166
in the Eagle Creek High School district,

12:55.208 --> 12:58.291
one of the best in the State.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.458
It wasn't easy coming in as a junior

13:08.500 --> 13:11.708
after the semester had already started.

13:13.708 --> 13:15.750
Your transcript is certainlyimpressive, Alex;

13:15.833 --> 13:20.041
I mean, one point below aperfect score on your ACT.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.625
Wow!

13:21.708 --> 13:24.166
I mean, considering how manyschools you've attended

13:24.208 --> 13:27.500
your GPA is especiallyremarkable.

13:27.541 --> 13:30.375
Yeah, I ah, I moved a lot.

13:30.416 --> 13:32.375
Well, you keep this upand you're well onyour way to getting

13:32.458 --> 13:34.000
into a top school.

13:34.041 --> 13:36.041
Any idea where you'dlike to go?

13:36.041 --> 13:37.708
Harvard.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.541
Any idea where you'dlike to go?Harvard.

13:39.625 --> 13:44.958
Well, that's a lofty goal,but one I think you can reach.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.625
Now, look, you're going to haveto keep up your grades.

13:47.666 --> 13:49.083
I will.

13:49.166 --> 13:51.375
I made a promise.

13:51.416 --> 13:53.208
Okay then.

13:53.208 --> 13:56.625
I'll do my best to help youkeep that promise.

13:59.208 --> 14:01.375
That needs to bemuch better.Okay then.

14:04.541 --> 14:07.083
This is a nice start.

14:12.541 --> 14:15.083
Exceptional work, Alex.

14:18.541 --> 14:20.250
You need up buck up.

14:20.291 --> 14:21.375

14:21.458 --> 14:23.375
All right people listen up;

14:23.375 --> 14:27.708

14:27.708 --> 14:31.500
on an aspect about governmentthat you will choose.

14:31.541 --> 14:32.541
[groans]

14:32.583 --> 14:35.208
Okay, okay, don't worry.

14:35.250 --> 14:38.583
You can work in groups of up to three people.

14:41.916 --> 14:45.708
Hey, new kid.

14:45.708 --> 14:46.416
Nice work in Rowe's class.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.375
That guy never gives an A.

14:47.416 --> 14:48.791
Yeah, it's like his thing.

14:48.875 --> 14:50.333
An A represents perfection,

14:50.375 --> 14:52.875
and I've never seena perfect paper.

14:52.958 --> 14:57.125
I'm Lucy, this is Danny.

14:57.208 --> 14:58.125
Alex.

14:58.166 --> 14:59.875
We were wonderingif you wanted to work

14:59.875 --> 15:01.708
on the midterm with us?

15:01.750 --> 15:02.708
Really?

15:02.750 --> 15:04.750
Yeah, I mean Danny here isa straight C student

15:04.833 --> 15:05.833
so he'll be tons of help.

15:05.875 --> 15:07.416
Hey, you shouldtalk Picasso.

15:07.416 --> 15:09.000
All she cares aboutis art and poetry.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.958
Hey, you shouldSocial studies isn't her thing.

15:11.041 --> 15:12.625
You can see what you'd begetting yourself into.

15:12.708 --> 15:14.416
I mean neither one of usis a brain like you.

15:14.416 --> 15:17.083
Not a problem, when doyou want to start?

15:17.166 --> 15:20.125
Do you want to meet at my houseon Saturday, 10:00?ke you.

15:20.166 --> 15:21.041
10:00?

15:21.083 --> 15:23.041
You know I sleep 'till noonon Saturdays.

15:23.083 --> 15:24.291
Fine, 11:00.

15:24.333 --> 15:25.208
Alex?

15:25.250 --> 15:26.333
Sounds good.

15:26.375 --> 15:28.541
Okay, but I'm going to be ina coma for the first hour.

15:28.541 --> 15:30.875
You're always in a coma.

15:30.958 --> 15:33.541
Eagle Creek High became everything to me.

15:33.625 --> 15:35.208
I immersed myself in studies

15:35.250 --> 15:38.541
and found compassion and support from my new friends.

15:38.583 --> 15:45.208
When chaos reigned at home, school became a refuge for me.

16:01.166 --> 16:02.333
Mom?

16:02.375 --> 16:03.041
What are you doing?

16:03.083 --> 16:04.375
I'm sick of these medications,

16:04.458 --> 16:06.416
the side effects aremaking me worse!

16:06.458 --> 16:09.500
I can't focus, my-my headis throbbing.

16:09.541 --> 16:10.750
I can't think!

16:10.791 --> 16:11.583
Stop it.

16:11.625 --> 16:12.750
Please!

16:12.750 --> 16:13.625
Mom!

16:13.708 --> 16:14.750
It hurts!Please!

16:14.791 --> 16:15.791
But you know what happenswhen you stop taking them!

16:15.833 --> 16:18.208
I don't care anymore!

16:51.208 --> 16:52.375
We really lucked outwith you Alex,

16:52.416 --> 16:54.208
we might actually doalright on this paper.

16:54.291 --> 16:55.666
We're going to get an A.

16:55.708 --> 16:57.541
You sound pretty sureof yourself.

16:57.583 --> 16:58.875
We have to;

16:58.916 --> 17:01.166
I've got to maintain a 4.0to have any chance

17:01.208 --> 17:02.833
at getting into Harvard.

17:02.875 --> 17:03.833
Harvard?

17:03.875 --> 17:05.250
Right and I'm goingto play shortstop

17:05.290 --> 17:06.540
for the Detroit Tigers.

17:06.583 --> 17:08.333
So you think I'm delusional?

17:08.375 --> 17:09.625
Yeah.

17:09.708 --> 17:10.750
I don't.

17:10.750 --> 17:13.833
I'm 1,000 percent positiveyou can do it.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.333
Mom?n't.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.875
I'm Home!

17:42.375 --> 17:44.708
Mom there's no food!

18:15.083 --> 18:25.083
[sobbing]

18:36.208 --> 18:37.083
I'm gonna get going,

18:37.125 --> 18:40.666
my mom and I are goingto an art show.

18:40.708 --> 18:44.291
Whoa, check this out,crazy lady 9:00.

18:44.375 --> 18:45.500
Alex!

18:45.541 --> 18:47.083
What are you doing here?

18:47.166 --> 18:48.208
You should be home!

18:48.291 --> 18:49.500
I've been looking everywherefor you!

18:49.541 --> 18:51.083
Why do I have to trackyou down?

18:51.083 --> 18:54.041
I had to come all the wayover here, why?

18:54.083 --> 18:55.000
Why do I have to trackyou down?Calm down.

18:55.041 --> 18:56.166
You don't tell me whatclasses you're taking

18:56.208 --> 18:58.125
or what you're doingafter school!

18:58.208 --> 18:58.958
Nothing!

18:59.000 --> 19:00.375
Mom, don't do this to me,please!

19:00.416 --> 19:02.500
Don't you dare tell me whatto do, I'm your mother.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.041
You respect me!

19:04.083 --> 19:05.541
Ah, excuse me, Mrs. Nistor?

19:05.541 --> 19:08.041
Ah, did you stop by the officeand get a visitor's pass?

19:08.041 --> 19:09.250
What?

19:09.291 --> 19:10.041
Ah, did you stop by the officeand get a visitNo.s pass?

19:10.083 --> 19:13.000
I'm sorry, it's school policy.

19:13.041 --> 19:14.708
Wanna come with me?

19:34.666 --> 19:35.875
Alex, wait!

19:35.875 --> 19:36.750
Leave me alone!

19:36.833 --> 19:38.875
Alex, please canyou talk to me?

19:38.958 --> 19:40.208
There's nothingto talk about!

19:40.208 --> 19:43.041
My mom is crazy, okay?

19:43.125 --> 19:44.833
Well, what's wrong with her?

19:44.875 --> 19:48.500
Well, she's sick,and she can't help it.

19:48.541 --> 19:52.500
We can't afford insurance soshe can't get good treatment.

19:52.541 --> 19:53.833
They hospitalize herwhen it's a crisis

19:53.875 --> 19:57.958
and when she's on her ownshe just can't cope.

19:59.541 --> 20:02.291
If you knew what sheused to be like

20:02.375 --> 20:05.375
before she got sick.

20:05.416 --> 20:07.875
She has a PHD;

20:07.875 --> 20:12.958
it kills her when her mindcan't function the way it did.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.291
That must be really hardfor her, and you.

20:17.333 --> 20:19.125
I think I know whatyou're going through.

20:19.208 --> 20:22.208
Oh, I doubt that.

20:22.291 --> 20:25.583
My father's arecovering alcoholic.

20:25.666 --> 20:29.166
Before he got sober he wascompletely unpredictable.

20:29.208 --> 20:30.708
Sorry Lucy, I had no idea.

20:30.750 --> 20:31.708
It's okay, he's good.

20:31.750 --> 20:34.541
He's in a program andhe's doing really great.

20:34.625 --> 20:40.375
He's my dad again.

20:40.458 --> 20:43.208
What are you going to doabout your mom?

20:43.250 --> 20:44.375
I don't know.

20:44.416 --> 20:51.208
I mean, I want to save her,but I don't know how.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.041
Sound pretty stupid,huh?

20:53.083 --> 20:56.500
No, it sounds heroic.

21:06.750 --> 21:07.708
What happened?

21:07.750 --> 21:10.500
I'm sorry Alex, your mothercouldn't pay the rent.

21:10.541 --> 21:12.541
You've been evicted.

21:13.583 --> 21:14.375
Where is she?

21:14.416 --> 21:15.750
Hospitalized.

21:15.833 --> 21:17.583
She went off her meds again!!

21:17.625 --> 21:19.250
I told her she's gotto keep taking them

21:19.333 --> 21:20.083
but she won't listen.

21:20.166 --> 21:22.166
I found an emergencyfoster home for you.

21:22.208 --> 21:23.416
Great, my fourth!

21:23.500 --> 21:25.125
Well, hopefully your mom willstabilize in a couple of weeks.

21:25.208 --> 21:26.208
Aww, what's the point?

21:26.208 --> 21:28.041
She'll just go off her meds,go crazy and wind up

21:28.125 --> 21:29.083
right back in the hospital!

21:29.083 --> 21:30.416
I understand how frustratedyou must be.

21:30.500 --> 21:31.208
right back iNo, you don't'!

21:31.250 --> 21:34.416
Yes, I do!

21:34.458 --> 21:36.500
Now, I've made arrangementsfor someone to come

21:36.541 --> 21:39.541
and take theseinto storage, okay?

21:39.625 --> 21:41.041
Just pick out a couple thingsthat you need

21:41.125 --> 21:44.750
and I will take you toyour foster placement.

21:50.375 --> 21:54.750
My mom was always being taken away from me.

21:54.791 --> 21:57.541
And while my social worker helped keep me fed,

21:57.625 --> 21:59.416
clothed and sheltered,

21:59.458 --> 22:03.416
the cycle of instability started to take a toll.

22:06.500 --> 22:10.375
For six years I had been in and out of foster homes,

22:10.416 --> 22:14.666
my mom in and out of hospitals.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.583
I kept telling myself that someday she'd get better,

22:17.625 --> 22:21.541
be like her old self again and stay that way,

22:21.625 --> 22:24.333
but I finally had to face reality;

22:24.375 --> 22:28.250
it just wasn't going to happen.

22:28.250 --> 22:30.083
If anything was going to change

22:30.083 --> 22:33.416
it would be up to me to change it.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.000
IfI just, I can't take itanymore.hange

22:36.041 --> 22:40.541
The depression, the rants,the constant uncertainty.

22:40.625 --> 22:44.666
Nobody should haveto live like that.

22:44.708 --> 22:46.583
What exactly are youasking, Alex?

22:46.666 --> 22:50.708
I'm asking to terminatemy mom's parental rights.

22:50.750 --> 22:54.375
I have the right dothat now, I'm 16.

22:54.416 --> 22:57.208
Do you fully understandwhat that means?

22:57.250 --> 23:00.875
Means I don't have to be afraidof her hurting herself anymore.

23:00.916 --> 23:03.125
Or me.

23:03.166 --> 23:05.708
It doesn't meanI don't love her.

23:10.041 --> 23:11.208
Let's begin.

23:11.208 --> 23:15.916
Alex, these attorneys are hererepresenting your mother.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.625
The court doesn't allow herto be present

23:17.666 --> 23:18.666
Alex, these attorneys are hererepresentiduring your testimony

23:18.708 --> 23:23.166
so that you may speakfreely and honestly.

23:23.208 --> 23:26.875
Do you understand?

23:26.916 --> 23:28.708
Very well, let's proceed.

23:28.750 --> 23:32.041
Alex, explain to Judge Bradywhy it is

23:32.083 --> 23:38.208
you want your mother'srights to be terminated.

23:38.291 --> 23:41.000
Please believe meYour Honor;

23:41.041 --> 23:45.125
this was the hardest decisionthat I've ever had to make.

23:45.208 --> 23:47.041
I love my mother;

23:47.041 --> 23:49.833
she was a role-modelfor me when I was little.

23:49.875 --> 23:53.333
I got my curiosity and loveof learning from her.

23:53.375 --> 23:55.000
But she's a verydifferent person now

23:55.041 --> 23:59.708
and if I'm put back in hercustody the circus will go on.

23:59.750 --> 24:00.875
The circus?

24:00.916 --> 24:03.500
The craziness.

24:03.541 --> 24:06.291
Being evictedfrom our apartment,

24:06.375 --> 24:08.208
not having enough food,

24:08.291 --> 24:10.791
police being called by neighborsbecause of her screaming,

24:10.833 --> 24:12.916
going in and outof foster homes.

24:12.916 --> 24:18.333
Do you understandwhat this means legally?

24:18.375 --> 24:20.583
going in and outYes, ma'am.omes.

24:20.666 --> 24:24.208
It means that accordingto the law

24:24.250 --> 24:27.208
I won't have a mother anymore.

24:48.416 --> 24:52.791
Alex, how could you do this?

25:03.083 --> 25:04.875
I'm sorry mom.

25:09.041 --> 25:19.041
[sobbing]

25:32.041 --> 25:36.666
Well, your mother's testimonydidn't help her case.

25:36.708 --> 25:40.791
The judge has grantedtermination of parental rights.

25:40.875 --> 25:42.541
You won.

25:42.583 --> 25:44.750
No, I didn't.

25:44.833 --> 25:47.375
Nobody won.

25:58.375 --> 25:59.833
You're 16 Alex,

25:59.875 --> 26:05.833
finding a permanent placementfor a teenager, I'm sorry.

26:05.875 --> 26:08.166
You'll be living here now.

26:08.208 --> 26:09.333
What about school?

26:09.375 --> 26:10.541
Well, you can stayat Eagle Creek.

26:10.625 --> 26:14.208
Umm, the orphanage has a driverwho will transport you

26:14.291 --> 26:18.041
and the school districtwill reimburse them.

26:18.083 --> 26:20.791
So I guess it's official now.

26:20.833 --> 26:22.208
What?

26:22.250 --> 26:26.125
I don't have a family anymore.

26:39.541 --> 26:43.875
Alright here's aninformation packet.

26:43.875 --> 26:47.291
As long as you accept all therules here you'll do just fine.

26:47.333 --> 26:48.375
Rules?

26:48.458 --> 26:52.291
There's no fighting, no loudmusic, lights out at 10:00.

26:52.375 --> 26:55.041
But I usually stay upstudying later than that.

26:55.083 --> 26:57.208
Well, you'll have to have yourhomework done by 10:00.

26:57.291 --> 27:01.541
I have five or six hoursof homework a night.

27:01.625 --> 27:05.708
Well, we could possiblymake an exception.

27:05.708 --> 27:06.500
Yes sir.

27:06.541 --> 27:07.875
Well, we could possiblymake an exception.Okay.

27:07.916 --> 27:11.208
It says here we're not allowedto have a checking account.

27:11.208 --> 27:12.125
That's correct.

27:12.208 --> 27:13.958
But I need mine so I havea safe place to keep

27:14.000 --> 27:15.666
what I earn from my jobat the bookstore.

27:15.708 --> 27:18.916
No, no, no, no, you're notallowed to have a job, son.

27:21.416 --> 27:24.916
I've never lived in aninstitution like this before.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.750
This is different for me,but maybe I'm different

27:27.791 --> 27:30.208
from the kids you'reused to dealing with.

27:30.250 --> 27:32.375
I work hard andI'm highly motivated,

27:32.375 --> 27:34.750
I'm saving moneyfor college.

27:34.791 --> 27:36.083
Don't you want kidsto come out of here

27:36.166 --> 27:37.541
and make somethingof themselves?

27:37.583 --> 27:41.375
That's what I'm tryingto do.

27:41.416 --> 27:44.041
Alright, but that doesnot mean you are free

27:44.083 --> 27:46.958
to come and go as you please.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.416
Okay.

27:48.458 --> 27:51.375
Oh, one more thing, doyou have a cell phone?

27:51.416 --> 27:52.541
Yes sir.

27:52.583 --> 27:55.250
Alright, hand it over, you'renot allowed to keep that.

27:55.333 --> 27:57.791
But I won't be able to stayin touch with my friends.

27:57.875 --> 28:01.166
Well, it's a security issue.

28:01.208 --> 28:03.375
Phone please.

28:22.958 --> 28:24.416
Hi,

28:26.875 --> 28:28.583
I'm Alex Chivescu.

Hey Henry, thanksfor picking me up.

31:07.208 --> 31:08.791
It's so stupid!

31:08.875 --> 31:09.666
I hate this crap.

31:09.708 --> 31:12.166
I mean, who caresabout x's and y's?

31:12.208 --> 31:15.750
What's the point?

31:15.791 --> 31:18.208
You know it's really not thathard once you get the basics.

31:37.250 --> 31:40.041

31:40.083 --> 31:40.958

31:42.208 --> 31:45.583
No, but I'm definitelygoing to college.

31:45.625 --> 31:48.291
Man kids like us don't goto college.

31:48.333 --> 31:50.208
I will.

31:50.250 --> 31:51.458
My mom told mea long time ago

31:51.541 --> 31:57.000
that education was like a keythat could open any door.

31:57.041 --> 32:00.208
What are you some kindof brain?

32:00.250 --> 32:03.208
Yeah, I guess.

32:03.291 --> 32:06.916

32:06.958 --> 32:08.791
I tutor kids at schoolto make extra money,

32:08.875 --> 32:12.416
I'd tutor you for free.

32:12.500 --> 32:17.208
And why would you do that?

32:17.250 --> 32:20.333

32:30.541 --> 32:32.375
Hey man, I can'thave guys thinking

32:32.416 --> 32:35.666
I'm an easy target, you know?

32:35.708 --> 32:37.583
You wanna have a lookat that equation?

32:37.625 --> 32:38.708
Not really.

32:38.750 --> 32:41.208
Come on, I'll show you.

32:41.250 --> 32:44.583

32:59.375 --> 33:00.375
A Tale of Two Cities.

33:00.416 --> 33:01.333
Remember?

33:01.375 --> 33:04.041
You used to read this to mewhen I was little.

33:07.833 --> 33:09.541
[reading]"It was the best of times;

33:09.583 --> 33:12.166
"it was the worst of times.

33:12.208 --> 33:13.666
"It was the age of wisdom;

33:13.708 --> 33:16.875
"it was the age offoolishness..."

33:23.875 --> 33:26.250

No.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000

34:02.041 --> 34:06.416
It's just being on drugsmakes your mom crazy, right?

34:06.416 --> 34:08.541
Not being on drugsmakes my mom crazy.

34:08.541 --> 34:09.583

34:09.625 --> 34:11.208
She's sick.

34:11.250 --> 34:15.583
She needs medicationbut she hates taking it.

34:15.666 --> 34:18.875

34:18.958 --> 34:21.541
Alright, 8 ballcorner pocket.

34:57.333 --> 34:58.958

They're kicking me out,sending me someplace

35:18.166 --> 35:19.375
with more supervision.

35:19.416 --> 35:20.708
Probably be somesort of lockdown.

35:20.750 --> 35:21.708
No, they can't do that.

35:21.791 --> 35:22.750
It's my third fight.

35:22.833 --> 35:24.791
That jerk Feldman won'teven listen to my side.

35:24.833 --> 35:26.416
All he cares aboutis the rules

35:26.458 --> 35:28.583

35:41.541 --> 35:42.750
Don't give up.

35:42.833 --> 35:44.708
Don't you give up either.

35:44.750 --> 35:46.083
Harvard?

35:46.166 --> 35:48.708
Man, that's gonna be cool.

36:14.083 --> 36:18.833
[â™ª]

36:18.875 --> 36:19.958

36:23.541 --> 36:24.083
Oh, that's okay.

36:24.125 --> 36:25.666

36:25.708 --> 36:27.291

36:46.541 --> 36:47.583
Your friends?

36:47.583 --> 36:50.250

36:50.333 --> 36:52.541
I'm sorry, Alex.?

37:01.500 --> 37:06.958
[telephone ringing]

37:07.000 --> 37:08.375
Hi Alex.

37:08.375 --> 37:10.041
Something wrong?

37:14.416 --> 37:15.916
Is it my mom?

37:15.958 --> 37:17.958
Your mom's okay.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.041
But I'm afraid we havesome bad news.

37:20.041 --> 37:21.958
Due to budget cuts theschool district can't afford

37:22.000 --> 37:24.541
to transport you herenext year.

37:24.583 --> 37:26.791
And I've spoken to the directorat Mercy Point

37:26.875 --> 37:30.041
and unfortunately theycannot cover the costs

37:30.041 --> 37:31.750
of driving you either.

37:31.833 --> 37:33.041
What does that mean?

37:33.083 --> 37:34.625
Where will I go to schoolfor my senior year?

37:34.708 --> 37:37.625
You'll have to attend a highschool closer to the orphanage.

37:37.708 --> 37:38.666
No!

37:38.708 --> 37:41.000
My counselors, teachersand friends are all here!!!

37:41.041 --> 37:42.208
Alex, I am sorry...

37:42.208 --> 37:43.875
Don't you understand?!!!

37:43.916 --> 37:46.000
This school is the only realhome I've ever known

37:46.041 --> 37:47.541
and now it's beingtaken away too.

37:47.583 --> 37:48.791
It's not fair!!!!

37:48.875 --> 37:50.541
Alex!

38:01.375 --> 38:02.416
I'm sorry Alex.

38:02.458 --> 38:04.208
I tried I really tried.

38:04.208 --> 38:06.375
Apparently there's some ruleagainst me driving you

38:06.416 --> 38:07.916
on company time.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.333
That's not fair, Henry!

38:10.375 --> 38:13.708
Changing schools it couldkeep me out of Harvard!

38:13.791 --> 38:16.250
Man, that school waseverything to me.

38:16.333 --> 38:17.541
I know how you must feel.

38:17.583 --> 38:18.916
No, you don't!

38:19.000 --> 38:20.333
You have no ideahow it feels,

38:20.375 --> 38:21.750
I've worked so hardfor so long

38:21.750 --> 38:23.208
and now you're just goingto take this away.

38:23.291 --> 38:24.708
I've worked so hardfor so longYou just hold on!

38:24.750 --> 38:26.708
Now maybe I didn'tgo to college.

38:26.750 --> 38:29.375
Hell, I didn't even graduatefrom the 8th grade,

38:29.416 --> 38:32.333
but I sure know what it feelslike to be disappointed!

38:32.375 --> 38:34.166
And I know what itfeels like, Alex,

38:34.208 --> 38:37.708
to have somethingtaken away from me.

38:38.958 --> 38:41.375
Henry, I didn't meanto take it out on you.

38:41.375 --> 38:42.458
Yeah, you did.

38:42.500 --> 38:46.833
Now you may beall book smart

38:46.875 --> 38:48.375
but you sure ain'tpeople smart.

38:48.416 --> 38:52.750
It's just that's all I have.

38:52.791 --> 38:55.500
Listen, that's not true.

38:55.541 --> 38:57.500
That's not true,you got friends.

38:57.541 --> 38:59.875
You got peoplewho car about you.

38:59.875 --> 39:05.708
You know I might not be much,but you got me too.

39:09.500 --> 39:12.791
Come on, let's get outof here.

39:25.125 --> 39:28.708
It's just I don't knowwhat to do Henry.

39:28.791 --> 39:32.125
They're taking schoolaway from me.

39:32.208 --> 39:35.875
Listen, you got a goodhead on your shoulders,

39:35.916 --> 39:37.625
so think.

39:37.708 --> 39:40.708
You can come upwith a plan.

39:40.708 --> 39:43.166
Use those famous smarts ofyours for something other than

39:43.208 --> 39:49.166
trying to keep peoplefrom getting close to you.

39:49.208 --> 39:51.750
Think man.

39:54.250 --> 39:55.958
You're right.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.541
Social services isnever going to help me.

39:58.583 --> 40:01.000
Maybe not.

40:01.041 --> 40:02.208
Come on, let's get back.

40:02.208 --> 40:03.541
What's the rush?

40:08.041 --> 40:10.041

40:29.958 --> 40:32.250
Hey, hey, hey, hey,slow it down.

40:39.500 --> 40:40.958
[telephone ringing]

40:41.041 --> 40:43.000
You've reached Mrs. Edenger at children's welfare,

40:43.041 --> 40:45.250
please leave a message.

40:45.333 --> 40:48.458
Mrs. Edenger,it's me Alex.

40:48.500 --> 40:49.875
I just wanted you to knowthat I'm through

40:49.916 --> 40:51.833
waiting for you to finda family for me.

40:51.875 --> 40:54.791
I'm going to findone myself.

41:15.750 --> 41:17.833
I'm sure you've never received a letter of this nature before

41:17.875 --> 41:20.958
and I'm also quite sure you'll be surprised

41:21.041 --> 41:21.916
by the circumstances...

41:22.000 --> 41:24.541
My mother is a nurturing and caring person

41:24.625 --> 41:26.041
who inspired my love of learning...

41:26.083 --> 41:28.041
I understand that it is a great emotional

41:28.083 --> 41:31.458
and financial burden to take a 17 year old into your home...

41:31.541 --> 41:34.375
straight A's, advanced placement college classes...

41:34.416 --> 41:35.750
and a strong desire.

41:35.791 --> 41:38.041
My most fervent dream is to be accepted

41:38.041 --> 41:39.375
into Harvard University.

41:39.416 --> 41:40.708
You have no commitment to me

41:40.750 --> 41:43.250
after I graduate from high school next year...

41:43.333 --> 41:45.791
..fail to respond to my urgent and dire...

41:45.875 --> 41:47.791
as of now I am a ward of the state...

41:47.833 --> 41:52.166
My social worker has kept me fed, clothed and sheltered

41:52.208 --> 41:55.000
but she doesn't understand how desperately I want to stay

41:55.041 --> 41:56.958
in the same school for senior year

41:57.000 --> 42:00.208
where the counselors who know me will help me apply to colleges,

42:00.250 --> 42:01.833
where the teachers who know me will help me

42:01.875 --> 42:03.916
write letters of recommendation and advise me

42:04.000 --> 42:07.625
and where my friends will be there to support me.

42:07.666 --> 42:10.375
I'm a good kid in a bad circumstance,

42:10.375 --> 42:13.708
I need a home.

42:13.750 --> 42:15.125
Thank you.

42:15.208 --> 42:17.833
Alex Chivescu.

42:27.041 --> 42:29.958
Hey, any repliesto your letter yet?

42:30.041 --> 42:31.541
Yeah, all negative.

42:31.583 --> 42:36.208
Look, there's somethingI want to tell you, man.

42:36.250 --> 42:38.875
I kinda asked my parentsif you could live with us

42:38.916 --> 42:41.708
but they said no.

42:41.750 --> 42:42.750
It's nothing personal.

42:42.833 --> 42:45.208
It's just you know they bothwork such long hours.

42:45.250 --> 42:48.333
It's okay, I understand.

42:48.375 --> 42:49.375
Sorry.

42:49.416 --> 42:51.208
Hey, don't be.

42:51.208 --> 42:53.333
I asked my parents too.

42:53.375 --> 42:55.125
They actuallyconsidered it but...

42:55.208 --> 42:59.625
You guys, it means a lotto me that you asked.

42:59.666 --> 43:01.750
Thanks.

43:09.666 --> 43:12.041
I got a letterfor you, bud.

43:21.541 --> 43:25.166
Dear Alex, my wife and I weredeeply moved by your letter.

43:25.208 --> 43:26.375
We'd like to meet youand discuss

43:26.458 --> 43:28.750
the possibility ofsharing our home.

43:28.750 --> 43:30.916
Yes!

43:31.958 --> 43:33.375
thI made you somefchocolate chip cookies,

43:33.416 --> 43:35.291
I hope you like them.

43:35.375 --> 43:39.000
Wow, thank you Mrs. Franks,they sure look good.

43:39.041 --> 43:41.083
They're our son Paul'sfavorite.

43:41.125 --> 43:43.708
He's at Camp Lesjunefor basic training.

43:43.750 --> 43:48.041
Takes after me, I'm alieutenant in the US Army.

43:48.083 --> 43:49.375
We live off base.

43:49.375 --> 43:51.875
Our house is modestbut we have an extra room

43:51.875 --> 43:55.750
now that Paul's gone.e off base.

43:55.833 --> 43:59.041
Did you get a lot of responsesto your letter?

43:59.125 --> 44:02.333
No sir, only youand Mrs. Franks.

44:02.375 --> 44:04.458
And you can call usJulia and Richard,

44:04.500 --> 44:07.041
and don't you darecall him sir.

44:07.125 --> 44:08.125
We might be in the army

44:08.208 --> 44:12.041
but we do not run our houselike a barracks.

44:12.125 --> 44:15.333
Well I'm sure you wantto know more about me.

44:18.375 --> 44:19.541
Ever done drugs?

44:19.583 --> 44:20.541
No sir.

44:20.583 --> 44:21.416
Drink?

44:21.458 --> 44:22.125
No.

44:22.208 --> 44:23.541
Been in troublewith the law?

44:23.583 --> 44:25.041
No.

44:27.541 --> 44:29.875
That's all we need to know.

44:29.958 --> 44:31.541
You mean that's it?

44:31.583 --> 44:33.833
No more questions,no thinking about it?

44:33.875 --> 44:35.541
We took Paul inas a foster child

44:35.541 --> 44:37.541
and ended up adopting him,

44:37.541 --> 44:41.416
we have no reservationsabout taking you in, Alex.

44:41.458 --> 44:44.625
Well, thank you Mr. Franks,Mrs. Franks,

44:44.708 --> 44:48.625
I mean Richard and Julia.

44:48.666 --> 44:49.958
Wow.

44:53.375 --> 44:55.041
[whistle]

44:55.083 --> 44:56.958
Hustle up!!

45:01.208 --> 45:03.416
This will be the kind of homeI never had.

45:03.500 --> 45:04.333
After everythingI've been through

45:04.375 --> 45:06.583
it feels like I canfinally relax.

45:06.666 --> 45:08.500
That's a good thing.

45:08.541 --> 45:10.125
What if it's too goodto be true?

45:10.166 --> 45:11.875
Don't over think this,Einstein.

45:11.958 --> 45:14.750
Just let yourself be happyfor once.

45:14.833 --> 45:16.875
You deserve it.

45:27.458 --> 45:30.166
Hi Alex.

45:30.208 --> 45:34.041
Hi, Mr. Feldman told me youwere here, is everything okay?

45:34.041 --> 45:38.833
We stopped by because wewanted to tell you in person,

45:38.875 --> 45:41.708
I'm being transferredto a base in New York.

45:41.750 --> 45:43.291
We leave in two months.

45:43.375 --> 45:44.375
Oh.

45:44.458 --> 45:46.541
But we want you to comewith us.

45:46.541 --> 45:47.958
You'd take me with you?

45:48.041 --> 45:48.958
Of course.

45:49.041 --> 45:52.041
You have a home with usas long as you need it.

45:52.041 --> 45:53.708
I don't know what to say.

45:53.750 --> 45:57.041
Say yes.

45:57.125 --> 46:00.333
I'm really grateful

46:00.375 --> 46:02.708
but moving away woulddefeat my whole purpose

46:02.791 --> 46:05.250
and it's the reasonI wrote the letter.

46:05.291 --> 46:11.041
I want....I need to stay hereand graduate from Eagle Creek,

46:11.083 --> 46:11.958
and I can't leave my mom.

46:12.041 --> 46:14.541
At least when I'm hereI know she's nearby.

46:14.541 --> 46:16.583
We understand.

46:16.583 --> 46:19.166
Is there another familyyou can stay with?

46:19.208 --> 46:23.333
Oh sure, definitely.

46:23.375 --> 46:26.625
I am so sorry, Alex.

46:26.666 --> 46:30.500
We really wanted thisto work out.

46:30.541 --> 46:33.041
Good luck son.

47:04.000 --> 47:09.000
Bills, bill and bill,there you go.

47:09.041 --> 47:13.125
Do either of you know someoneby the name of Alex Chivescu?

47:13.208 --> 47:14.375
Nope.

47:14.416 --> 47:15.083
Who is he?

47:15.125 --> 47:18.208
I don't know, let's find out.

47:18.291 --> 47:23.791
Oh, goes to Eagle Creek High,and he lives in an orphanage.

47:23.833 --> 47:25.541
How sad.

47:25.583 --> 47:27.333
He's looking for a fosterfamily to live with

47:27.375 --> 47:29.208
during his senior year.

47:29.250 --> 47:31.041
He's going to college after that,

47:31.083 --> 47:33.666
his father is out of the picture

47:33.708 --> 47:35.458
and his mother haspsychiatric issues

47:35.541 --> 47:38.208
and lost custody of him?

47:38.208 --> 47:40.208
We need to meet him, mom.

47:40.291 --> 47:41.041
Jen.

47:41.125 --> 47:42.000
Mom.

47:42.041 --> 47:43.375
Look this isn't likeyour stray dogs or cats

47:43.458 --> 47:44.541
or wounded birds...

47:44.583 --> 47:45.625
Or turtles.

47:45.708 --> 47:47.125
Exactly, that you broughthome since you would walk.

47:47.208 --> 47:49.208
I mean this, we don'teven know this kid.

47:49.250 --> 47:50.208
It's probably a scam.

47:50.250 --> 47:52.625
Dad, can you imagine the gutsthat it took for him

47:52.666 --> 47:53.833
to write this letter?

47:53.875 --> 47:56.666
He's turning to total strangersbecause he has nobody else.

47:56.708 --> 47:58.375
You don't even know him,Jen.

47:58.375 --> 48:02.000
Well, I know that he's got tofeel scared and desperate.

48:02.041 --> 48:06.375
I have you guys, this kiddoesn't have anyone.

48:06.458 --> 48:08.708
We need to help him.

48:10.833 --> 48:14.250
Bringing a stranger intoour home is serious business.

48:17.791 --> 48:19.500
We need to learnmore about him

48:19.541 --> 48:21.291
and then we can talkabout it.

48:21.333 --> 48:23.000
Alright.

48:25.125 --> 48:26.416
I'm going to go checkif he's on Facebook

48:26.500 --> 48:27.875
and add him as a friend.

48:27.916 --> 48:28.916
Okay.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.333
Our daughter has a verybig heart.

48:30.375 --> 48:32.250
Yeah, well, I know whereshe gets that from.

48:32.333 --> 48:35.750
But Suzanne this has to bea thoughtful discussion.

48:35.791 --> 48:37.083
There's too much at stakefor our family

48:37.125 --> 48:38.625
and for this young man.

48:38.708 --> 48:39.833
I know.

48:39.875 --> 48:41.541
He's on Facebook!

48:41.583 --> 48:42.625
Let me see.

48:42.666 --> 48:46.583
He's kinda a nerd in a nice waybut a total brain.

48:46.666 --> 48:48.541
He looks friendly mom.

48:48.583 --> 48:49.625
He does Jim.

48:49.708 --> 48:51.041
Oh.

48:51.041 --> 48:53.083
So when can we meet him?

48:53.166 --> 48:54.583
Now hold on you two,come on.

48:54.666 --> 48:56.958
Dad, I'm going to be goingto college in the fall.

48:57.041 --> 48:59.375
You and mom are goingto be here all alone.

48:59.375 --> 49:02.041
The empty nest thing is goingto be really hard on you.

49:02.041 --> 49:03.208
Or liberating.

49:03.250 --> 49:06.041
No more loud music, no moregiggling girls at sleepovers.

49:06.083 --> 49:07.625
Very funny.

49:07.666 --> 49:10.333
I suppose we could just meetthe boy, Jim.

49:16.041 --> 49:17.375
Yeah, I suppose we could.

49:17.375 --> 49:18.416
Yay!!!!

49:18.500 --> 49:19.708
That's all I'm promising.

49:19.750 --> 49:20.458
Sure.

49:20.500 --> 49:21.708
Sure.

49:26.333 --> 49:27.875
I didn't' realize I'd beso nervous.

49:27.916 --> 49:29.291
Me neither.

49:29.333 --> 49:31.375

49:52.708 --> 49:56.208

50:04.250 --> 50:06.333
from some of my teachersand my social worker.

50:06.375 --> 50:09.541
Alex, you're not applyingfor a job.

50:09.583 --> 50:10.708
If we do this,

50:10.708 --> 50:14.958
we're not asking for you tolive with us for a year or so,

50:15.000 --> 50:17.833
we're inviting youinto our home

50:17.875 --> 50:23.041
to be part of our family,permanently.

50:23.083 --> 50:24.583
Permanently?

50:24.625 --> 50:25.541
That's right.

50:25.583 --> 50:26.500
Yeah.

50:26.541 --> 50:29.291
So you really needto think about that,

50:29.375 --> 50:32.083

I wouldn't' have made itwithout you.

51:43.250 --> 51:45.666
No need my man,this isn't goodbye.

51:45.708 --> 51:47.041
You'll come and see me?

51:47.083 --> 51:48.041
Of course!

51:48.083 --> 51:51.750

52:25.041 --> 52:26.500
Well, I don't want to takeyour room.

52:26.541 --> 52:27.375
Oh, no, it's okay.

52:27.375 --> 52:28.875
I moved intothe smaller guest room.

52:28.916 --> 52:30.375
I leave for collegein a couple of weeks

52:30.375 --> 52:32.041
so I won't be homethat much.

52:32.083 --> 52:33.875
It will be your job to lookafter my parents,

52:33.958 --> 52:36.375
make sure they don't partytoo hard.

52:42.166 --> 52:45.708
Two years ago I wasdiagnosed with Lupus,

52:45.791 --> 52:48.583
I have flare-ups sometimes.

53:06.000 --> 53:10.291
and my mom and my dadthey never left my side.

53:10.375 --> 53:12.916
I can't imagine whatit's been like for you,

53:13.000 --> 53:14.416
not having your parents around.

53:14.500 --> 53:17.041
I mean, it's justthe way it is.

53:17.125 --> 53:19.166
I don't even remembermy dad,

53:19.208 --> 53:21.000
but my mom was incredible.

53:21.041 --> 53:22.708
Before she got sickshe was on her own,

53:22.750 --> 53:26.083
raising a kid, somehow stillmanaged to get her PHD.

53:37.541 --> 53:38.791
Okay, no way!

53:38.833 --> 53:40.000
What?

53:40.041 --> 53:43.750
When it comes to music we weredefinitely separated at birth.

53:44.708 --> 53:47.041
I wish I wasn't goingto college so soon;

53:47.083 --> 53:50.625
you are going to bea cool little brother.

53:50.666 --> 53:53.000
Just don't be bratty.

53:53.041 --> 53:56.208
Deal, as long as you'renot bossy.

53:58.125 --> 53:58.666
Hey!

53:58.708 --> 53:59.666
Welcome to the family!

53:59.708 --> 54:02.958
[laughing]

54:03.041 --> 54:04.750
So don't worry about me,

54:04.833 --> 54:07.708
'cause I found a really nice foster family

54:07.791 --> 54:11.416
and they have a daughter who already feels like a sister.

54:11.500 --> 54:14.166
I'm still working hard towards getting into Harvard,

54:14.208 --> 54:17.125
my counselor thinks I can do it.

54:19.416 --> 54:21.958
Remember when I made that promise to you?

54:22.041 --> 54:24.625
I'm going to keep it.

54:24.708 --> 54:26.583
I miss you mom.

54:26.625 --> 54:28.208
Love Alex.

54:38.625 --> 54:39.875
Hey there he is.

54:39.875 --> 54:41.458
Good morning, Alex.

54:41.541 --> 54:42.041
Morning.

54:42.083 --> 54:43.541
Eggs and toast okay?

54:43.583 --> 54:45.208
Thanks, Mrs. Bante.

54:45.291 --> 54:48.333
You know Alex, you don't haveto call us Mr. and Mrs. Bante.

54:48.375 --> 54:50.375
What would you like meto call you?

54:50.375 --> 54:51.166
I don't know.

54:51.208 --> 54:51.916
Jim and Suzanne?

54:52.000 --> 54:53.041
Whatever you'recomfortable with.

54:53.083 --> 54:54.000
Yeah.

54:54.041 --> 54:56.375
Well, I'm comfortablewith Mr. and Mrs. Bante.

54:56.375 --> 54:57.166
Okay.

54:57.208 --> 54:58.333
Well, I'm comfortablewith Mr. and MOkay.ante.

54:58.375 --> 55:00.583
Grab a seat, Alex.

55:05.166 --> 55:08.125
We never had a chanceto talk about your chores.

55:08.208 --> 55:09.000
Chores?

55:09.041 --> 55:10.666
Yeah, everyone pitches in here,

55:10.708 --> 55:14.125
so when Jen leaves for schoolyou'll take over her jobs.

55:14.166 --> 55:15.833
Well, what kind of jobs?

55:15.875 --> 55:18.041
Well, for example, today'strash pick up day,

55:18.083 --> 55:20.166
so when you leave the houseyou'll put the cans out.

55:20.208 --> 55:21.041
When you come homefrom school

55:21.125 --> 55:22.375
you'll put them backin the garage.

55:22.416 --> 55:26.333
We'll talk about the restlater, I gotta run.

55:26.375 --> 55:27.375
Bye honey.

55:27.458 --> 55:28.416
Bye.

55:29.583 --> 55:31.708
I will see you guys tonight.

55:38.625 --> 55:39.833
Scrambled?

55:39.875 --> 55:41.541
Ah, yes please.

55:41.541 --> 55:43.708
Great.

55:53.875 --> 55:55.708
I can't take it,it's too much..

55:59.875 --> 56:01.458
And a bunch of chores too.

56:01.500 --> 56:02.833
And Mrs. Bante cameinto my room,

56:02.875 --> 56:04.791
tried to get me to talkto her.

56:04.875 --> 56:06.208
Well imagine that.

56:11.125 --> 56:17.583
Okay, remember to checkyour side mirrors.

56:17.583 --> 56:21.083
She wants me to talkabout my feelings.

56:21.166 --> 56:22.250
Okay, remember to checkSo what's the problem?

56:22.333 --> 56:25.458
I don't know, they're notmy parents you know,

56:25.541 --> 56:27.916
I wish they'd stopacting like they are.

56:27.958 --> 56:29.416
Why?

56:29.500 --> 56:32.541
Because I don't need that.

56:32.541 --> 56:34.000
You don't need it,

56:34.041 --> 56:36.041
or you don't knowhow to handle it?

56:36.125 --> 56:40.041
I wish they'd just let mepay rent and leave me alone.

56:40.083 --> 56:42.000
Really Alex?

56:42.041 --> 56:44.750
I mean, is that whatyou really want?

56:53.041 --> 56:55.791
Hey Alex,how was school?

56:55.833 --> 56:57.000
Fine.

56:57.041 --> 56:59.375
Learn anythinginteresting today?

56:59.416 --> 57:00.833
Not really.

57:00.875 --> 57:03.000
Can I have an apple?

57:03.041 --> 57:06.291
Alex, this is your home,you don't have to ask.

57:06.375 --> 57:08.500
You know when Jen was in senioryear all she wanted to do

57:08.541 --> 57:10.041
was bring her friends overand...

57:10.083 --> 57:13.708
Mrs. Bante, I got lotsof homework to do.

57:13.791 --> 57:16.750
Yeah sure, go ahead.

57:26.541 --> 57:28.041
[knocking]

57:28.083 --> 57:30.291
Come in.

57:30.333 --> 57:33.708
Hey Alex, I just wantedto say goodnight.

57:33.708 --> 57:37.041
Goodnight, Mrs. Bante.

57:37.041 --> 57:41.458
Alex, I want you to know thatyou're part of our family now

57:41.500 --> 57:42.458
and the thing aboutfamilies is

57:42.500 --> 57:44.791
that we can talkto one another.

57:44.875 --> 57:47.041
So if there's anything you want to say...

57:47.125 --> 57:50.375
I'm fine Mrs. Bante.

57:50.375 --> 57:52.000
Good.

57:52.041 --> 57:53.416
But if you ever do wantI'm fineto talkante.

57:53.500 --> 57:57.208
Jim and I are readyto listen.

57:57.208 --> 58:03.291
Okay um, alright,goodnight.

58:03.375 --> 58:04.958
Night.

58:07.166 --> 58:09.375
It's a miracle he turned outas well as he did.

58:09.416 --> 58:11.833
He doesn't know how to dothe most basic things

58:11.875 --> 58:14.875
and his social skillsdefinitely need some work.

58:14.916 --> 58:16.708
I think his upbringingwas a lot more difficult

58:16.708 --> 58:17.833
that we realized.

58:17.875 --> 58:19.041
Well, at least hetalks to you Jim,

58:19.125 --> 58:20.583
he barely says a wordto me.

58:20.666 --> 58:21.958
Don't take it personally,honey.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.541
It's not about my feelings,it's about his.

58:24.583 --> 58:27.500
I can only imagine whatit must be like for him.

58:27.541 --> 58:29.375
I just wish that he feltsafe enough with us

58:29.416 --> 58:32.041
to open up and sharewhat he's going through.

58:32.083 --> 58:33.208
Suzanne, he barely knows us

58:33.250 --> 58:36.708
and he definitelydoesn't trust us yet.

58:36.750 --> 58:39.208
Well, what if he never can?

58:39.250 --> 58:40.458
Well, that's up to him.

58:40.500 --> 58:43.875
He'll let us past his defensesor he won't.

58:43.875 --> 58:48.041
There has got to be somethingwe can do to help him.

58:48.083 --> 58:51.333
All we can do is treathim like what he is,

58:51.375 --> 58:54.708
a member of this family.

58:54.750 --> 58:57.416
Jim, are we crazy to havegotten into this?

58:57.458 --> 59:00.875
Probably, but no matterhow it turns out

59:00.958 --> 59:03.250
I'm not going to besorry that we tried.

59:03.291 --> 59:04.583
You?

59:04.583 --> 59:05.791
No.

59:05.833 --> 59:07.333
Good.

59:18.875 --> 59:20.875
Call us as soon as youget there, okay?

59:20.916 --> 59:22.083
I will mom.

59:22.166 --> 59:24.000
And I know you're going to bebusy but please stay in touch.

59:24.041 --> 59:25.458
Okay.

59:29.125 --> 59:30.708
Go.

59:33.375 --> 59:34.250
Keep an eye on them;

59:34.291 --> 59:36.666
don't let them getinto too much trouble.

59:39.416 --> 59:42.541
It will be okay, they'renot the coolest parentsin the world

59:42.625 --> 59:44.500
but they'll be therefor you

59:44.541 --> 59:47.458
just like they'vealways been for me.

59:50.375 --> 59:51.875
Wouldn't ya know it.

59:51.958 --> 59:55.541
I finally get a brotherand I have to leave.

59:55.541 --> 59:57.291
Are you gonna miss me?

59:57.333 --> 59:58.416
Nah.

59:58.458 --> 01:00:00.666
Ha, very funny.

01:00:00.708 --> 01:00:01.875
See you at Christmas.

01:00:01.916 --> 01:00:03.458
See ya.

01:00:21.375 --> 01:00:23.750
But Mr. Bante I don't needyou to give me money

01:00:23.791 --> 01:00:24.875
to buy Christmas gifts.

01:00:24.916 --> 01:00:26.208
I don't want to bea charity case.

01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:29.041
Don't give me that Alex,you're not a charity case.

01:00:29.041 --> 01:00:31.666
Don't assume what peoplefeel for you is pity.

01:00:31.708 --> 01:00:34.250
It might actually belex,something else.arity case.

01:00:34.333 --> 01:00:39.333
Alex, come here,listen to me;

01:00:39.375 --> 01:00:41.041
I want to be clear here.

01:00:41.083 --> 01:00:44.708
You've had a rough time,life hasn't been fair,

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:46.250
but it wasn't your fault.

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:49.083
Now it's natural to feelsorry for yourself,

01:00:49.125 --> 01:00:51.916
but that's not goingto get you anywhere.ault.

01:00:51.958 --> 01:00:55.708
Look, we respect everythingyou've accomplished,

01:00:55.791 --> 01:01:00.916
but more so we respectwho you've become.

01:01:00.958 --> 01:01:04.666
Now, I know it's beenhard all this time

01:01:04.708 --> 01:01:08.208
with your dad notbeing around,

01:01:08.291 --> 01:01:11.166

01:01:11.208 --> 01:01:14.208
Now what do you say we getthis tree in the house, huh?

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:21.166

She made in second grade.

01:01:35.708 --> 01:01:38.458
Look at that.

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:39.916
Everything okay, Alex?

Nice work, this callsfor a celebration.

01:01:59.291 --> 01:02:01.500
Do you have an extra cardI could have for my mother,

01:02:01.541 --> 01:02:02.500
Mrs. Bante?

01:02:02.541 --> 01:02:04.541
Yeah, of course Alex.

Would you help mewith the tree?

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:12.000
Yeah.

01:02:12.041 --> 01:02:14.875
You know, Alex, if you wanted toget a present for your mother

01:02:14.875 --> 01:02:17.208
I could take you shopping,pick out something nice.

01:02:17.208 --> 01:02:19.875
No thanks, Mrs. Bante.

01:02:19.958 --> 01:02:22.875
Well, if you want to visit herI could take you there.

01:02:22.875 --> 01:02:24.708
I don't think so.

01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:27.708
Alex, it must be hard spendingChristmas without her.

01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:30.833
No, I've spent a lot ofChristmas's without her.

01:02:36.375 --> 01:02:38.250
College girl's home!

01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:40.250
Hey!

01:02:41.583 --> 01:02:42.541
Oh welcome home sweetheart!

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:44.208
Did dad tell you how muchwe missed you?

01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:46.291
Only for the last 300 miles.

01:02:46.333 --> 01:02:47.916
Good, good, well let'sget you settled.

01:02:47.958 --> 01:02:50.500
There's tons of foodin the kitchen.

01:02:57.083 --> 01:03:02.000
It is so good to be home withmy folks and my little bro.

01:03:02.041 --> 01:03:05.375
College is greatbut the food sucks.

01:03:05.375 --> 01:03:08.250
I'm so excited for mom'sChristmas Eve dinner tonight.

01:03:08.291 --> 01:03:12.208
The turkey smells so good!

01:03:12.291 --> 01:03:16.250
Believe me you're goingto want seconds.

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:18.458
Jen,

01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:21.791
Behow come you don't mindtosharing your parents with me?

01:03:21.833 --> 01:03:26.541
It doesn't take anything awayfrom how they feel about me.

01:03:26.583 --> 01:03:28.458
They have plenty of loveto go around.

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.833
It's just who they are.

01:03:29.875 --> 01:03:31.541
But they hardly know me.

01:03:31.625 --> 01:03:33.583
I mean, how couldthey love me?

01:03:33.625 --> 01:03:35.416
Because they do.

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.958
You're worth being loved,Alex.

01:03:39.041 --> 01:03:40.791
You know that right?

01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:47.083
Are you going to go seeyour mom on Christmas?

01:03:47.125 --> 01:03:49.250
No.

01:03:49.333 --> 01:03:53.875
Or at least call her?

01:03:53.916 --> 01:03:55.458
Do you ever talk to her?

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:59.083
I um, I write to her.

01:03:59.166 --> 01:04:00.875
Well, that's good.

01:04:12.541 --> 01:04:14.208
What's this?

01:04:14.208 --> 01:04:16.541
I don't send the letters.

01:04:16.541 --> 01:04:17.583
Why not?

01:04:17.625 --> 01:04:19.708
You don't know how angryshe was Jen. the letters.

01:04:19.708 --> 01:04:23.250
Especially when I went to courtto terminate her rights.

01:04:23.291 --> 01:04:26.083
I abandoned her,just like she did to me

01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:28.208
only she couldn't help it.

01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:30.083
Neither could you.

01:04:30.083 --> 01:04:31.833
Well, I don't thinkshe'll ever forgive me.

01:04:31.875 --> 01:04:34.875
Of course she will,she's your mom.ou.

01:04:34.916 --> 01:04:38.208
She loves youno matter what.

01:04:40.333 --> 01:04:42.000
Come on, let's go.

01:04:42.041 --> 01:04:43.000
Where to?

01:04:43.041 --> 01:04:45.166
Let's go give your momthe best Christmas present

01:04:45.208 --> 01:04:47.083
that she has ever had.

01:06:37.916 --> 01:06:39.833
There's one from your tennisteam, your debate club

01:06:39.875 --> 01:06:40.916
when you ran forstudent counsel

01:06:40.958 --> 01:06:43.208

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:44.291
Me neither.

01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:45.708

I think he is.

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.791
He probably never had much ofa real Christmas growing up.

01:07:23.875 --> 01:07:28.458
I'm sure it's just a bitoverwhelming for him.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.583

And what about yourcollege interviews?

01:10:34.875 --> 01:10:35.791

Not a problem,what happened?

01:12:04.875 --> 01:12:06.208
I don't know exactly.

01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:07.416
I thought she was doing okay.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:11.625
Now she's been evicted andnow she's back in the hospital.

01:12:11.666 --> 01:12:12.916
Okay.

01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:37.500
This is why I'm always afraidto let her back in my life.

01:12:37.541 --> 01:12:39.375
Do the Bantes knowabout this?

01:12:39.416 --> 01:12:40.833
I didn't wantto tell them.

01:12:40.875 --> 01:12:43.750
Well, I'm pretty surethey'd want to help.

01:13:04.583 --> 01:13:07.166
You okay Alex?

01:13:07.208 --> 01:13:09.458
I should have beenthere for her.

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.000
I should have takencare of her.

01:13:11.041 --> 01:13:12.333
You're just a kid.

01:13:12.375 --> 01:13:14.375
You couldn't take careof her.

01:13:14.375 --> 01:13:15.875
You need help.

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:17.333
You need to tell the Bantes.

01:13:17.375 --> 01:13:18.666
Get them involved.

01:13:18.708 --> 01:13:20.208
No, this is noneof their concern.

01:13:20.291 --> 01:13:22.708
Yes, it is becauseyou're their concern.

01:13:22.708 --> 01:13:24.708
That's the problem, Henry.

01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:27.041
They want to help too much.

01:13:27.083 --> 01:13:29.500
Because they care about you.

01:13:29.541 --> 01:13:33.166
That's just the way momsand dads are, man.

01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:35.375
I already have a mother.

01:13:35.416 --> 01:13:40.458
Oh Alex, it's notthe Bantes fault

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.041
that your mom couldn'ttake care of you.

01:13:43.125 --> 01:13:45.416
You gotta stop blaming them.

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:49.125
Everybody needs somebody.

01:13:49.166 --> 01:13:52.750
Stop trying to act likeyou're different.

01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:57.000

01:13:57.041 --> 01:13:58.583

We can go up anytime.

01:14:18.875 --> 01:14:20.541
Do you want us to go inwith you?

01:14:20.583 --> 01:14:24.041
Well, if you don't mindI'd like to go in alone.

01:14:24.083 --> 01:14:26.000
Of course,we'll wait here.

01:14:26.041 --> 01:14:28.416

Should we go talk to him?

01:16:44.375 --> 01:16:45.083
Not right now.

01:16:45.125 --> 01:16:45.875
He needs a little timeto deal

01:16:45.958 --> 01:16:47.333
with whateverhappened back there.

Sorry for what?

01:17:30.875 --> 01:17:34.000
You tried to do allthis nice stuff for me

01:17:34.041 --> 01:17:35.875
and I couldn't handle it.

01:17:35.875 --> 01:17:40.208
I wasn't used to it.

01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:41.875
I know.

01:17:41.916 --> 01:17:44.500
You thought I was tryingto take your mother's place.

01:17:44.541 --> 01:17:48.375
You do all the thingsthat I needed her to do.

01:17:48.416 --> 01:17:50.708
I feel guilty thinking thatyou were better at it

01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:51.708
than she was.

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:55.041
Alex, your mother couldn'tgive you what you needed

01:17:55.083 --> 01:18:00.583
but I know she triedas hard as she could.

01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:02.125
How can you be so sure?

01:18:02.208 --> 01:18:06.000
Because I know how mucha mother loves a child,

01:18:06.041 --> 01:18:08.541
how much we wantto protect them.

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:09.708
And if we're unableto do that

01:18:09.791 --> 01:18:13.708
it's because it's outof our control.

01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:17.458
It's the worst feelingin the world.

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:22.666
I know your mother lovesyou Alex, I know it.

01:18:22.708 --> 01:18:25.000
And so do I.

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:34.291
[knocks]

01:18:34.333 --> 01:18:36.250
Rise and shine buddy,today's the big day.

01:18:36.291 --> 01:18:38.291
Suzanne pressed your suit,picked out a tie,

01:18:38.333 --> 01:18:41.208
and we're having French toastfor breakfast.

01:19:08.041 --> 01:19:10.333
Alex, why aren't you dressed?

01:19:10.375 --> 01:19:11.541
Yeah, your interviewis at 11:00.

01:19:11.583 --> 01:19:13.708
It's all the wayacross town.

01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:15.541
I'm not going.

01:19:15.541 --> 01:19:17.708
What?

01:19:17.791 --> 01:19:20.041
I mean, what's the point?

01:19:20.083 --> 01:19:23.833
I've just been kidding myself.

01:19:23.875 --> 01:19:26.250
Why would Harvardtake a kid like me?

01:19:26.291 --> 01:19:28.041
I've been in and outof seven foster homes

01:19:28.125 --> 01:19:29.333
and nothing ever works out

01:19:29.375 --> 01:19:32.083
so why would this beany different?

01:19:32.125 --> 01:19:34.000
I'll tell you why, Alex,

01:19:34.041 --> 01:19:35.916
because you have a gift.

01:19:35.958 --> 01:19:38.166
One that you inheritedfrom your mom,

01:19:38.208 --> 01:19:40.291
and her of all peoplewould hate to see you

01:19:40.333 --> 01:19:42.208
throw that gift away.

01:19:42.250 --> 01:19:45.500
Did something happenat the hospital?

01:19:45.541 --> 01:19:49.708
If you talk about itmaybe we can help.

01:19:49.708 --> 01:19:51.375
Please.

01:19:53.875 --> 01:19:57.916
When I was 10 and I sawher in the hospitaltfor the first time,

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.875
you know what really gotto me?

01:19:59.875 --> 01:20:01.791
It was her hands.

01:20:01.833 --> 01:20:04.125
At the time I calledthem her alligator hand

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:06.541
because she had themcurled up tight

01:20:06.583 --> 01:20:10.875
against her chestlike this.

01:20:10.958 --> 01:20:15.250
I saw those same hands againlast night.

01:20:15.291 --> 01:20:19.458
After all these yearsnothing's changed.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:20.541
She's never goingto get better

01:20:20.583 --> 01:20:22.375
and it's always goingto be the same.

01:20:22.416 --> 01:20:24.500
You can't give into that.

01:20:26.875 --> 01:20:28.291
But what if I end uplike my mother?

01:20:28.333 --> 01:20:31.208
Alex, that is not goingto happen.

01:20:31.250 --> 01:20:33.208
I just wanted her to tell meI could do it.

01:20:33.250 --> 01:20:36.041
She knows you can do it.

01:20:36.083 --> 01:20:38.916
And so do we.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.666
You know what, Alex,

01:20:40.708 --> 01:20:45.708
we haven't asked a lot of youbut we're asking now.

01:20:45.708 --> 01:20:48.333
Go upstairs,put that suit on

01:20:48.375 --> 01:20:51.541
and let's get youto that interview.

01:21:04.541 --> 01:21:07.875
Firm handshake, right?

01:21:07.875 --> 01:21:10.833
That's right.

01:21:26.916 --> 01:21:28.916
Alex Chivescu?

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.833
How do you do?

01:21:30.875 --> 01:21:34.875
Please come on up,we've got lots to talk about.

01:22:21.375 --> 01:22:22.541
Well, how'd it go?

01:22:22.583 --> 01:22:24.500
I gave it my best shot.

01:22:24.541 --> 01:22:25.833
That's my boy.

01:22:25.875 --> 01:22:27.916
Come on.

01:22:37.416 --> 01:22:39.416

01:22:47.708 --> 01:22:49.791

Second, I used to thinkthat this was everything.

01:23:04.041 --> 01:23:06.750
