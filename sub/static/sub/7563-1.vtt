if we aren't damned sorry

25:17.933 --> 25:20.482
to have missed the last one
and how we should be gung ho

25:20.602 --> 25:22.479
to do our duty in the next.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.356
Not that there's going to be
a next one.

25:25.149 --> 25:27.447
There's always a next one.

25:27.985 --> 25:29.953
So how about it?

25:30.070 --> 25:31.413
A bet?

25:35.617 --> 25:37.961
The odds are too short.

25:39.830 --> 25:42.208
[Wargrave laughs]

25:44.877 --> 25:47.221
Listen to them.
Clinging on.

25:47.337 --> 25:49.089
I mean, they think
they still mean something

25:49.214 --> 25:54.345
but nobody at all would notice
or care if they just...

25:54.470 --> 25:55.892
[Smacks lips]

25:56.013 --> 25:59.608
I'm going to be
exceptionally charming to them.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.656
Oh, all right, Miss Claythorne.

26:05.773 --> 26:09.573
If it'll make you happy,
I'm sorry for staring.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.661
[ Glass rattles]

26:11.779 --> 26:16.455
Mr. Lombard, I doubt
you're ever sorry for anything.

26:20.662 --> 26:22.664
Smart girl.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.512
[ Birds crying ]

26:32.883 --> 26:34.977
[Gong chimes]

26:39.515 --> 26:41.609
[Gong chimes]

26:56.240 --> 26:59.460
Ladies and gentlemen,
lobster souffle.

26:59.576 --> 27:02.170
I hope it's not too rich.

27:02.287 --> 27:05.291
I always dine so modestly
at home.

27:09.586 --> 27:10.462
Mmm.

27:10.587 --> 27:12.510
I won't, thank you.

27:13.757 --> 27:14.849
DAVIS:
Thank you.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.595
We've met before, you know.

27:17.719 --> 27:20.689
Forgive me.
My memory is not what it was.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.979
Perhaps you gave evidence
before me.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.147
DR. ARMSTRONG:
No. No, it wasn't that.

27:25.269 --> 27:27.988
I'd remember that.
Something else.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.111
It'll come to me.

27:30.232 --> 27:32.075
EMILY:
I'm not at all sure about these.

27:32.192 --> 27:34.536
They look very...pagan.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.406
They're the 10
little soldiers --

27:37.531 --> 27:39.078
you know, from the poem.

27:39.199 --> 27:41.952
MacARTHUR:
Mm. I know it off by heart.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.751
When I was a little boy, my
nanny used to recite it to me.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.500
I imagine she wanted to
terrify me into being --

27:47.624 --> 27:48.876
into being good.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.503
Did it work?

27:50.627 --> 27:53.801
Well, I've always been
a stickler, yes.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.549
Stickler for the rules.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.052
I was probably
a rather dull boy.

27:58.177 --> 28:01.306
[ Chuckles ] I really can't
imagine that, General.

28:01.430 --> 28:05.025
Although, you shouldn't call it
a poem, Miss Claythorne.

28:05.142 --> 28:06.769
It's doggerel.

28:06.894 --> 28:08.771
Poetry should be uplifting.

28:08.896 --> 28:10.523
I agree with you, Miss Brent.

28:10.647 --> 28:13.150
Well, that just shows
how wrong first impressions are.

28:13.275 --> 28:15.027
I didn't think
you were the type of gentleman

28:15.152 --> 28:16.654
to appreciate poetry.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.247
Mr. Davis has hidden depths.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.752
The soufflé is delicious.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.964
Mm.
Very light.

28:30.167 --> 28:32.670
[Thunder rumbles]

28:36.715 --> 28:38.592
WARGRAVE:
Over 40 years in criminal law,

28:38.717 --> 28:40.060
I have come face-to-face

28:40.177 --> 28:44.057
with the most depraved examples
of mankind and felt no fear.

28:44.181 --> 28:47.185
But I quail in terror,
Miss Claythorne,

28:47.309 --> 28:50.529
at the thought of young ladies
brandishing hockey sticks.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.694
They're not so bad, Judge.

28:52.814 --> 28:55.784
A little overexcited
and noisy sometimes.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.120
WARGRAVE:
Oh, the prerogative of youth.

28:58.779 --> 29:02.158
And I'm sure you set them
a very fine example.

29:02.282 --> 29:05.536
Sometimes you dread what filth
they're going to serve,

29:05.661 --> 29:06.958
but this is actually
very decent.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.956
The Owens are always
generous hosts.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.879
EMILY:
Friends of yours, Mr. Davis?

29:10.999 --> 29:12.251
Business acquaintances.

29:12.376 --> 29:15.095
Uh, I'm in tinned goods.

29:15.212 --> 29:18.432
The firm started off
supplying troops with stew.

29:18.548 --> 29:21.301
Tinned goods is what helped us
win the war.

29:21.426 --> 29:25.226
Well, I suppose -- I suppose
an army marches on its stomach.

29:25.347 --> 29:26.473
Here we go.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.896
God, I remember that stew.

29:29.017 --> 29:31.566
MacARTHUR: RAMC, I presume,
Dr. Armstrong.

29:31.687 --> 29:32.734
DR. ARMSTRONG:
That's right.

29:32.854 --> 29:36.233
Clearing stations and then
hospitals in Belgium and France.

29:36.817 --> 29:39.195
Perhaps you're being interviewed
as well.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.367
Interviewed, General?

29:41.488 --> 29:42.284
Yes.

29:42.406 --> 29:44.750
Mr. Owen is an amateur

29:44.866 --> 29:47.619
but very knowledgeable
military historian.

29:47.744 --> 29:49.838
He's writing about France,
about the decisive actions...

29:49.955 --> 29:51.548
[Whispering]
For God's sake, it's over.

29:51.665 --> 29:52.757
MacARTHUR:
...in 1917.

29:52.874 --> 29:56.174
No, I'm, uh, I'm just here
to get away from it all.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.638
MacARTHUR:
Interesting man, Mr. Owen --

29:57.754 --> 29:59.722
and an interesting name.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.558
Ulick Norman.

30:01.675 --> 30:03.268
How funny.

30:03.385 --> 30:06.013
Mrs. Owen is Una Nancy.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.264
EMILY:
Matching initials.

30:07.389 --> 30:11.110
I must confess I was a little
worried about the "Ulick."

30:11.226 --> 30:13.775
Given the current climate,
it might be seen <i>as</i> somewhat...

30:13.895 --> 30:14.817
[ Clears throat]

30:14.938 --> 30:16.315
...Teutonic.

30:16.440 --> 30:19.034
You couldn't hope to meet
a more patriotic man.

30:19.151 --> 30:23.748

than "Norman“?

30:37.919 --> 30:41.890
She might look like the undead,
but she can definitely cook.

30:43.050 --> 30:46.805
Uh, when might we expect
the Owens?

30:46.928 --> 30:48.305
Have they not telephoned?

30:48.430 --> 30:51.434
THOMAS: There's no telephone
on the island, madam.

30:51.558 --> 30:53.526
Mr. Narracott brings messages

30:53.643 --> 30:55.691
along with the post and
kitchen supplies every morning.

30:55.812 --> 30:57.485
And I imagine tomorrow

30:57.606 --> 30:59.825
he will bring either a telegram
from the Owens

30:59.941 --> 31:02.285
or they will accompany him.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.955
ANTHONY: Uh, Rogers, give that
Narracott chap a couple of bob.

31:06.073 --> 31:07.575

Of course, sir.

31:13.663 --> 31:17.384
And I shall pass on your
compliments to Mrs. Rogers.

31:18.752 --> 31:20.425
Uh, look here, Davis.

31:20.545 --> 31:25.346

are they...fun-loving types?

31:25.467 --> 31:26.764
Fun-loving?

31:26.885 --> 31:29.229
Yeah. 'Cause there's something
a tad off here.

31:29.346 --> 31:32.646
Now, I had a letter inviting me
to a house party.

31:33.892 --> 31:37.146
Pretty young things, you know,
champagne, music.

31:37.270 --> 31:38.396

a bit lively,

really look like fun-loving,

Oh, you saw her.

31:50.951 --> 31:52.828
Isn't she a beauty?

31:52.953 --> 31:54.921
I honestly can't imagine
loving a person

No, I didn't.

32:02.796 --> 32:05.265
You ran me off the road.

32:07.217 --> 32:08.560
When?

32:08.677 --> 32:10.645
I was driving along,
minding my own business,

32:10.762 --> 32:12.730
and you overtook me
going God knows how fast,

32:12.848 --> 32:14.521

at a pitiful speed.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.615
I think an apology and
a handshake between gentlemen

32:21.731 --> 32:22.948
would be just the thing here.

32:23.066 --> 32:24.568

wrong.

- You ran me off the road.
- I might have overtaken you,

32:26.862 --> 32:28.660

with more zip,

your car,

you really shouldn't be behind
the wheel.

to tell me it's my fault?!

were you involved with, General?

Well, I served
on the North-West Frontier,

in South Africa,
and, of course, in France.

well known.

34:53.882 --> 34:55.976
Nor particularly good either.

34:56.553 --> 34:57.679
Why do you say that?

34:57.804 --> 34:59.647
Otherwise, you would not
be needing employment

Their fees are not high enough,
nor is their pay.

35:04.477 --> 35:07.230
Not that I disapprove
of you seeking employment

35:07.355 --> 35:08.231
and being busy.

35:08.356 --> 35:09.858
Far from it.

in a third-rate establishment

35:13.903 --> 35:16.907

53:34.837 --> 53:37.056
Almonds be buggered.

53:37.172 --> 53:38.924
Cyanide.

53:40.050 --> 53:42.894
I trust you're not going to
unravel on us, Miss Claythorne.

53:44.346 --> 53:46.690
Hysterical women are so boring.

53:56.233 --> 53:57.985
WOMAN: [ Echoing ]
Thank you for trying.

53:58.110 --> 53:59.737
Thank you for trying.

53:59.862 --> 54:01.864
Thank you.
Thank you for trying.

54:01.989 --> 54:05.835
Oh, God.
[ Sobs ]

54:07.995 --> 54:10.339
[ Boy shouting ]

54:10.456 --> 54:12.925
CYRIL:
I want to swim to the rocks!

54:13.041 --> 54:14.964
Cyril, darling,
you know you can't.

54:15.085 --> 54:16.257
You're not strong enough.

54:16.378 --> 54:17.595
I am!

54:17.713 --> 54:18.760
Cyril, behave yourself.

54:18.881 --> 54:20.383
Listen to Miss Claythorne,
dearest.

54:20.507 --> 54:21.554
No!

54:21.675 --> 54:23.427
OLIVIA:
That's incredibly naughty.

54:23.552 --> 54:25.099
I'm so sorry, Miss Claythorne.

54:25.220 --> 54:26.938
Oh, dear.
He's getting all worked up.

54:27.055 --> 54:29.774
Cyril, you will make yourself
ill.

54:29.892 --> 54:31.144
MAN:
What's all this, now?

54:32.686 --> 54:34.029
Uncle Hugo!

54:34.146 --> 54:38.026
I can hear you shouting from
miles away, you young rascal.

54:38.150 --> 54:40.744
OLIVIA: Oh, thank heavens.
In the nick of time.

54:40.861 --> 54:43.364
Olivia, you look
absolutely radiant, as ever.

54:43.489 --> 54:45.287
Mm.
Empty flattery.

54:45.407 --> 54:48.707
I'm completely raddled
and utterly hideous.

54:49.578 --> 54:51.922
I don't believe I've had
the pleasure.

54:52.039 --> 54:54.087
OLIVIA:
Hugo, this is Miss Claythorne,

54:54.208 --> 54:57.257
who was doing so much to help
Cyril in the schoolroom.

55:21.944 --> 55:25.289
[Waves breaking,
birds crying in distance]

55:54.935 --> 55:56.653
[ Door closes]

55:59.106 --> 56:02.280
Have you been for a paddle,
General?

56:03.861 --> 56:05.955
What are you, Lombard?

56:08.115 --> 56:10.538
A mercenary?

56:10.659 --> 56:12.957
Gun for hire?

56:13.078 --> 56:14.546
Soldier?

56:15.831 --> 56:21.554
Not from any army I'd recognize,
but still a soldier of sorts.

56:21.670 --> 56:23.843
You don't need to worry
about what I am.

56:25.340 --> 56:27.513
There's always a moment,
isn't there?

56:27.634 --> 56:34.267
Before the attack, the advance,
the bombardment, the chaos.

56:34.975 --> 56:38.479
A moment of absolute calm.

56:39.897 --> 56:41.444
Listen.

56:42.566 --> 56:48.289
Doesn't this feel like...
that moment?

56:51.533 --> 56:55.208
I was never a man for calm,
General.

56:58.040 --> 57:00.884
We can't see the harbor
from here.

57:01.376 --> 57:04.095
Which means they can't see us.

57:05.213 --> 57:07.307
We are cut off.

57:08.050 --> 57:10.303
Rats in a barrel.

57:12.137 --> 57:17.519
This is the peace
before the carnage.

57:25.025 --> 57:27.574
People do not just die
for no reason.

57:27.694 --> 57:30.243
They die because something
was done to them by someone.

57:30.364 --> 57:33.288
There's a Fenian sat over there
with a bloody gun!

57:33.408 --> 57:34.625
MacARTHUR:
No one's coming for us.

57:34.743 --> 57:35.710
This is the end.

57:35.827 --> 57:37.579
Don't you dare touch
my possessions!

57:37.704 --> 57:38.921
VERA:
What have you got to hide?

57:39.039 --> 57:41.258
The whole morning,
clearing up guts.

57:41.375 --> 57:43.343
You've got
some right brass neck.

57:43.460 --> 57:46.589
We are all being hunted.

57:46.713 --> 57:49.091
There's someone else
on this island,

57:49.216 --> 57:52.186
and when I find him,
I'm gonna make him number 22.
