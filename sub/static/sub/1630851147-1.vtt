00:42.083 --> 00:43.125
WATCHER: <i>Time.</i>

00:46.500 --> 00:47.583
<i>Space.</i>

00:49.333 --> 00:50.375
<i>Reality.</i>

00:53.250 --> 00:54.916
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

00:59.916 --> 01:04.458
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility,</i>

01:06.791 --> 01:10.916
<i>where a single choice</i>
<i>can branch out into infinite realities,</i>

01:13.041 --> 01:16.166
<i>creating alternate worlds</i>
<i>from the ones you know.</i>

01:19.833 --> 01:21.166
<i>I am the Watcher.</i>

01:23.625 --> 01:26.791
<i>I am your guide</i>
<i>through these vast new realities.</i>

01:28.208 --> 01:31.833
<i>Follow me and ponder the question...</i>

01:35.333 --> 01:36.666
<i>"What if?"</i>

01:45.166 --> 01:47.833
<i>Earth, June, 1943.</i>

01:47.916 --> 01:51.791
<i>The Nazi army marches across Europe,</i>
<i>leaving death and destruction.</i>

01:52.750 --> 01:57.166
<i>The Allied armies band together</i>
<i>to create a new kind of soldier.</i>

01:57.250 --> 01:58.416
<i>A Super Soldier.</i>

01:59.375 --> 02:01.125
<i>At humanity's darkest hour,</i>

02:01.208 --> 02:04.666
<i>a skinny kid from Brooklyn</i>
<i>became Captain America.</i>

02:04.750 --> 02:07.083
<i>After turning the tide of World War II,</i>

02:07.166 --> 02:12.166
<i>he made the ultimate sacrifice,</i>
<i>restoring peace and saving this universe.</i>

02:13.041 --> 02:17.875
<i>But in another universe,</i>
<i>a single choice created a whole new hero.</i>

02:18.750 --> 02:20.875
All this to make one Super Soldier.

02:20.958 --> 02:23.250
Paris has fallen. London might be next.

02:23.333 --> 02:25.375
If this works, you could end the war.

02:25.458 --> 02:28.416
We mere mortals
can only dream of doing such things.

02:31.916 --> 02:35.625
Agent Carter, wouldn't you
be more comfortable in the booth?

02:39.083 --> 02:40.708
No, I'd prefer to stay.

02:40.791 --> 02:41.833
WATCHER: <i>There.</i>

02:41.916 --> 02:45.875
<i>That's the moment</i>
<i>that created a new universe.</i>

02:46.750 --> 02:51.583
<i>When asked to leave the room,</i>
<i>Margaret "Peggy" Carter chose to stay.</i>

02:51.666 --> 02:57.458
<i>But soon it would be her venturing</i>
<i>into the unknown and creating a new world.</i>

02:58.041 --> 03:01.833
The serum will cause
immediate cellular change.

03:01.916 --> 03:04.375
In order to prevent uncontrolled growth,

03:04.458 --> 03:08.083
the subject will be saturated
with Vita-Rays.

03:22.125 --> 03:23.625
No!

03:35.666 --> 03:40.041
-Steve! Eyes on me. Focus on me.
-(GROANS)

03:40.125 --> 03:41.458
HOWARD: Power levels are dropping.

03:41.541 --> 03:43.458
We either do this now,
or we lose the project.

03:43.541 --> 03:45.208
-Rogers, get in there!
-He can't!

03:45.291 --> 03:48.125
-Stark, you go in.
-What? Are you crazy? I push the buttons.

03:48.208 --> 03:49.750
-I'm the buttons guy.
-FLYNN: Get in there!

03:49.833 --> 03:52.666
HOWARD: Tech and bullets don't mix.
We'll lose everything. It has to be now!

03:52.750 --> 03:54.166
FLYNN: Do you know how much this cost?

03:54.250 --> 03:55.791
HOWARD: We won't get another shot at this.

03:55.875 --> 03:57.041
Hang on. I'll be right back.

03:57.125 --> 03:58.458
I'm not goin' anywhere.

03:58.541 --> 03:59.666
Howard, get ready.

03:59.750 --> 04:01.875
-Agent Carter.
-What are you doing?

04:07.916 --> 04:09.833
Agent Carter, what are you doing?

04:09.916 --> 04:12.458
This is our only chance. Now!

04:12.541 --> 04:14.333
Stark, don't do this.

04:57.625 --> 04:59.500
-Did it work?
-And then some.

04:59.583 --> 05:01.416
You won't be needing those heels anymore.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.750
Peggy? Wow.

05:03.833 --> 05:05.916
I'd call this an absolute success.

05:06.708 --> 05:08.666
What an absolute failure!

05:08.750 --> 05:11.958
Sixty million dollars and all the hope
in the world down the drain.

05:12.041 --> 05:13.666
I was promised an army.

05:13.750 --> 05:16.125
I was promised peace and salvation.

05:16.208 --> 05:17.458
Instead, I get a girl.

05:17.541 --> 05:19.791
I understand
this is not the desired outcome,

05:19.875 --> 05:22.083
but I can be more
than a human pin cushion.

05:22.166 --> 05:24.416
The SSR is under my command now.

05:24.500 --> 05:28.250
Be grateful you're here and not being
brought up on charges of insubordination.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.166
We were about to lose the entire project.

05:30.250 --> 05:32.166
-If I hadn't stepped in--
-FLYNN: Well, we did.

05:32.250 --> 05:35.958
Every last drop
of that Dr. Erskine serum went into you.

05:36.041 --> 05:37.166
And if we get lucky,

05:37.250 --> 05:40.166
someday your blood might tell us
how to make a real Super Soldier.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.208
You have a Super Soldier.

05:42.291 --> 05:46.250
Women aren't soldiers, and they sure
as hell don't fight on the front lines.

05:46.333 --> 05:47.916
They might break a nail.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.125
Nice left hook.

05:59.208 --> 06:02.333
Not according to Colonel Flynn,
that weapons-grade moron!

06:05.375 --> 06:07.583
If only I was allowed
to do that to Hitler's head.

06:07.666 --> 06:08.708
It could be worse.

06:08.791 --> 06:10.916
Flynn could stick you
on one of those USO tours.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.375
Wear a crazy costume,
being told to smile ten times a day.

06:14.458 --> 06:17.208
He wouldn't. He couldn't. Could he?

06:19.625 --> 06:20.791
MAN: March!

06:23.166 --> 06:24.291
Bucky.

06:24.375 --> 06:26.541
It's a buddy of mine from Brooklyn.

06:26.625 --> 06:28.291
He just deployed with the 107th.

06:28.375 --> 06:30.583
The army won't even
tell me where he's going.

06:30.666 --> 06:32.583
We all have someone fighting for us.

06:32.666 --> 06:34.541
Would be nice if we could fight for them.

06:35.666 --> 06:36.750
I'm sorry.

06:36.833 --> 06:38.958
You were meant to be
the one to end the war.

06:39.041 --> 06:40.041
Now you will.

06:40.916 --> 06:44.541
And don't worry about me.
I never was much of a dancer anyway.

06:46.208 --> 06:48.416
Maybe you haven't found the right partner.

07:09.666 --> 07:12.500
Tønsberg, Norway.
A real Christmas card of a town.

07:12.583 --> 07:14.833
-Well, it was.
-Nazis were in Norway?

07:14.916 --> 07:19.041
Close. HYDRA. Hitler's very own
Supernatural Sciences Division.

07:19.125 --> 07:21.250
Given the gamma signatures
from that clock tower,

07:21.333 --> 07:23.458
what they were looking for
could power London.

07:23.541 --> 07:26.458
Or blow it
to kingdom come inside 60 seconds.

07:27.541 --> 07:31.625
The Tesseract was the jewel
of Odin's treasure room.

07:31.708 --> 07:35.500
Fabled to hold the power
to rewrite the very laws of physics

07:35.583 --> 07:38.250
and unlock doors across the universe.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.416
What you seek is just a legend.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.666
Then why do you try so hard to hide it?

07:52.291 --> 07:53.708
PEGGY: It's called the Tesseract.

07:53.791 --> 07:55.916
FLYNN: That thing must be
halfway to Berlin by now.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.208
More like two-thirds.
But we have a chance.

07:58.291 --> 08:01.166
-If we send a team tonight, we can get--
-You're out of your mind.

08:01.250 --> 08:04.000
-I could go.
-Great, now you're both crazy. Fantastic.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.291
Now I have two crazy people
running around the place.

08:06.375 --> 08:09.541
Thirty men, max. If this reaches
HYDRA High Command, it's game over.

08:09.625 --> 08:14.000
I'm not risking one man, never mind
a platoon, over a glorified battery.

08:14.083 --> 08:16.333
-The greatest minds alive--
-And Stark is one of them.

08:16.416 --> 08:18.375
It's not your concern.
You're lucky to be here.

08:18.458 --> 08:21.708
The greatest minds alive can't fathom
the extent of this battery's power.

08:21.791 --> 08:24.083
Good. Who knows,
maybe the war will be over

08:24.166 --> 08:27.500
before HYDRA figures out
how to turn the damn thing on.

08:33.166 --> 08:34.666
Drowning your troubles?

08:35.166 --> 08:38.541
-I thought you Brits were resilient.
-Just the men, apparently.

08:38.625 --> 08:41.958
-Can I give you a piece of advice?
-(SIGHS) I'd rather you didn't.

08:42.041 --> 08:44.958
Flynn's a moron.
Lucky for you, I'm a genius.

08:46.541 --> 08:49.333
-What's this?
-It was supposed to be your USO

08:49.416 --> 08:52.333
"let's go sell some war bonds" costume,
but I made a few upgrades.

08:52.416 --> 08:54.166
Your covert skills need work.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.500
-Then this is gonna be awkward.
-(METAL THUDS)

09:44.916 --> 09:48.375
(IN ENGLISH) That was brilliant!
Let's give it another go.

10:02.541 --> 10:04.833
(CHUCKLES) Are you seeing this?

10:13.208 --> 10:15.125
(EXCLAIMS) I'm usually a bit more covert.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.458
Where have you been all my life?

10:35.541 --> 10:37.625
GERMAN OFFICER: The Allies
must be desperate,

10:37.708 --> 10:40.458
sending in a fragile <i>Fräulein</i>
to fight for them.

10:40.541 --> 10:41.791
"Fragile"?

10:54.541 --> 10:56.416
-(SWEARS IN GERMAN)
-(IN ENGLISH) Exactly.

10:58.166 --> 11:00.083
The war's out there, Colonel, not in here.

11:00.166 --> 11:03.041
If we're going to win,
it won't be with me stuck behind a desk.

11:03.125 --> 11:05.708
-Is this nuclear?
-PEGGY: Are you listening?

11:05.791 --> 11:08.250
You're an agent,
you're not qualified for field duty.

11:08.333 --> 11:09.708
Then you better promote me.

11:09.791 --> 11:13.541
"Captain" has a nice ring to it.
I trust you know what to do with that.

11:14.416 --> 11:16.250
Oh, I know exactly what to do with this.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.708
Ready to join the war effort, Steve?

11:26.583 --> 11:30.125
PEGGY: The last intel report said
the 107th hit enemy fire here.

11:30.208 --> 11:32.291
If your friend
was taken prisoner by HYDRA...

11:32.375 --> 11:35.000
Bucky's unit is now
50 kilometers behind the front line.

11:35.083 --> 11:38.041
-I can't ask you to go.
-You're not asking. He's your friend.

11:38.125 --> 11:40.208
-The best one I got.
-Even better.

11:40.291 --> 11:43.000
To take down HYDRA,
we'll need all the friends we can get.

11:45.333 --> 11:47.916
-I owe you one.
-PEGGY: You owe me more than that.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.500
You owe me a dance.

11:56.625 --> 11:59.208
-This is nice. You mind if I have a go?
-(GROANS)

12:19.958 --> 12:20.958
SOLDIER: The <i>Fräulein!</i>

12:29.041 --> 12:31.708
Since when did dames fight like that?

12:37.833 --> 12:39.583
Since today. Understood.

12:39.666 --> 12:42.916
Are you the 107th?
I'm here for Sergeant Barnes.

12:43.500 --> 12:46.083
Who are you supposed to be,
Queen of England?

12:49.083 --> 12:52.041
Steve Rogers sent me.
The name's Captain Carter.

13:07.708 --> 13:09.708
Air support. Send air support.

13:09.791 --> 13:12.000
ROGERS: <i>Copy that. Rogers inbound.</i>

13:12.083 --> 13:13.625
-Steve?
-Rogers?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.791
What in heavens?

13:23.083 --> 13:24.083
Steve!

13:24.166 --> 13:26.208
ROGERS: Hey, Peggy! Now you owe me one.

13:32.083 --> 13:35.791
Hold on a second. She's friends
with that HYDRA Stomper?

13:35.875 --> 13:37.541
I think I'm friends with him, too.

13:42.708 --> 13:45.458
Stark made me some new dancing shoes.
What do you think?

13:45.541 --> 13:47.416
Well, then we better start dancing.

14:12.083 --> 14:14.375
Hold on. You can't even drive a car.

14:14.458 --> 14:17.625
So, a dame and a flying Buick. Okay.

14:17.708 --> 14:19.833
Let's hear it for Captain Carter!

14:21.416 --> 14:23.583
Save the cheers for the victory parade.

14:23.666 --> 14:25.041
We have a war to win.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.666
We're all very proud.
Especially me, Mr. President.

14:37.750 --> 14:40.541
I've always said
that Peggy is a real knockout.

14:47.041 --> 14:49.708
It's called the HYDRA Stomper.
Yes, Mr. President.

14:49.791 --> 14:51.875
Yes, sir, I told Stark to build it myself.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.333
GERMAN GENERAL: (IN ENGLISH)
Captain Carter and this

15:39.416 --> 15:42.958
so-called HYDRA Stomper
are wreaking havoc.

15:43.041 --> 15:46.458
The <i>Führer</i> demands
your presence in Berlin!

15:47.500 --> 15:51.458
"Demands"? "Demands," does he?

15:51.541 --> 15:55.750
But a god does not answer to a man.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.916
"A god"? You? (SCOFFS)

15:59.000 --> 16:02.416
You lost the Tesseract,
and now you play with metal trinkets.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.291
I would not expect a creature
of your limited capacity to understand.

16:08.375 --> 16:14.333
Soon, the true champion of HYDRA
shall be summoned from beyond the stars.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.750
My champion.

16:16.833 --> 16:19.250
Yours? How dare--

16:33.125 --> 16:35.166
The Third Reich.

16:35.250 --> 16:41.041
The Third Reich will fall
and HYDRA will rise from its ashes.

16:41.125 --> 16:47.166
Hail HYDRA! Hail HYDRA!
Hail HYDRA! Hail HYDRA!

16:50.916 --> 16:54.083
Oh... I miss a good whisky.

16:54.875 --> 16:57.500
But the serum
doesn't allow me to feel the effects.

16:59.416 --> 17:02.458
Okay. Okay, I gotta ask. How did it feel?

17:02.541 --> 17:06.583
What, to get the serum? Honest truth,
not as different as you might think.

17:07.416 --> 17:09.000
Wow. You've always been a fighter.

17:09.750 --> 17:12.500
In a way,
the outside finally matches the inside.

17:12.583 --> 17:14.500
The way people view me has changed.

17:15.083 --> 17:19.208
I'm no longer screaming to be heard,
to be seen, to be in the room.

17:19.291 --> 17:20.833
To be respected.

17:26.041 --> 17:27.458
Must be nice.

17:27.541 --> 17:31.208
I'm still that skinny kid from Brooklyn,
now just in a big metal suit.

17:31.791 --> 17:35.375
You're more than the suit. The suit
is nothing without the man inside.

17:35.458 --> 17:39.583
You're my hero, Steve.
I mean, you're a hero.

17:42.375 --> 17:43.375
Hmm.

17:44.041 --> 17:45.458
You're my hero, too.

17:51.125 --> 17:52.458
Hey, Barnes stole a jeep.

17:53.625 --> 17:55.958
Come on, Steve, let's go.
You, too, Carter.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.666
Whoa. Hey, what's going on?

17:58.166 --> 18:01.625
Oh, no, no, no. No, you continue.
Just pretend I'm not here.

18:12.083 --> 18:14.125
If our intel is correct and the Red Skull,

18:14.208 --> 18:16.500
the very head of HYDRA,
is on that train...

18:16.583 --> 18:19.333
We can end the war?
Yeah, I've heard that one before.

18:19.416 --> 18:22.083
Something about this smells
as fresh as three-day-old fish.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.250
Or maybe you're just afraid of trains.

18:35.708 --> 18:36.875
I'm in position.

18:36.958 --> 18:38.708
PEGGY: <i>Copy. Time to make our entrance.</i>

18:38.791 --> 18:41.666
Commencing Operation "Where Eagles Dare."

18:53.083 --> 18:56.000
Whew. Thanks.
You almost ripped my arm off.

18:56.083 --> 18:59.166
Rogers, what's your status?
Do you see the Red Skull?

18:59.250 --> 19:00.583
I've got a visual, but...

19:00.666 --> 19:02.458
<i>-I'll take a closer look.</i>
-Copy that.

19:02.541 --> 19:03.708
Hey, don't forget to knock.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.833
-Oh, no. Peggy, go! Get out of--
-(EXPLOSION)

19:36.875 --> 19:38.375
Steve!

19:44.166 --> 19:46.291
Peggy, we gotta go.

19:46.375 --> 19:47.458
Steve!

19:53.833 --> 19:55.041
Steve!

19:58.125 --> 19:59.750
FLYNN: You said that glowing ice cube

19:59.833 --> 20:01.458
could rewrite the laws of physics.

20:01.541 --> 20:02.541
HOWARD: It can!

20:02.625 --> 20:04.541
You said
the HYDRA Stomper was indestructible.

20:04.625 --> 20:05.833
It is! Was.

20:05.916 --> 20:10.125
His name is Steve Rogers,
not "the HYDRA Stomper."

20:10.208 --> 20:12.083
Steve. And we've lost...

20:15.250 --> 20:17.833
FLYNN: She should never have been
in the field in the first place.

20:20.916 --> 20:23.291
Ah. <i>Fräulein</i> Carter.

20:23.375 --> 20:26.083
I was wondering when you might visit me.

20:26.166 --> 20:30.625
You're wasting your time.
I will tell you nothing!

20:31.583 --> 20:32.791
He told me everything.

20:32.875 --> 20:34.166
According to our German guest,

20:34.250 --> 20:37.333
Red Skull believes
he can unleash an interdimensional force

20:37.416 --> 20:39.833
that will lead HYDRA to world domination.

20:39.916 --> 20:42.500
And if that fails, world annihilation.

20:42.583 --> 20:44.791
Talk about being
a few sardines short of a can.

20:44.875 --> 20:48.333
The Red Skull has taken cover here,
at Castle de Krake in the Black Forest.

20:48.416 --> 20:52.083
No wonder HYDRA targeted Rogers.
You'd need the Stomper to get close.

20:52.166 --> 20:54.875
Colonel, you're lucky
to even be in the room.

20:55.750 --> 20:58.583
The Red Skull wants to destroy our world.

20:58.666 --> 21:01.041
In many ways, he already has.

21:02.541 --> 21:05.041
I say, we return the favor.

21:05.125 --> 21:08.333
I say, we burn that castle to the ground.

21:08.416 --> 21:12.708
But if we do this, know that
we might not succeed in ending the war,

21:12.791 --> 21:16.541
we might not survive,
but we will stop HYDRA.

21:16.625 --> 21:19.458
-I'm in. For Steve.
-Yes.

21:19.541 --> 21:21.083
-Let's do it.
-For Rogers.

21:22.250 --> 21:25.458
Oh. I'm not a... You know...

21:25.541 --> 21:28.500
Come on, Howard.
We might need someone to push a button.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.375
Well, that was fun.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.833
Now comes the hard part.

22:16.541 --> 22:17.541
You go high, I go low?

22:17.625 --> 22:19.875
We'll shake hands in the middle.

22:19.958 --> 22:22.791
-Howard?
-Yep. Coming. (SIGHS)

23:10.958 --> 23:12.833
Hey, which way are we going?

23:13.625 --> 23:15.916
-That way.
-Should we not have a plan?

23:16.000 --> 23:17.833
Who needs a plan? I have a shield.

23:17.916 --> 23:21.000
A shield is not a plan. Oh, Carter...

23:34.166 --> 23:38.250
(LAUGHS MALICIOUSLY)
The champion of HYDRA has risen.

23:40.041 --> 23:42.125
What the bloody hell?

23:42.208 --> 23:45.333
Monsters? No one prepared me
for actual monsters.

23:46.458 --> 23:48.875
You are too late, Captain Carter.

23:48.958 --> 23:51.291
I have summoned the champion of H--

23:56.791 --> 23:57.875
Whoa!

23:57.958 --> 24:00.125
Okay, maybe we need a plan.

24:00.916 --> 24:04.208
-Stark was right. Indestructible.
-(ROGERS GROANS)

24:04.291 --> 24:08.333
Steve! Steve.
Come on, pal, don't give up on me.

24:08.416 --> 24:11.208
Hey, I need a hand!
Come on, help me get him out of here!

24:11.291 --> 24:13.875
No. You gotta get me in the suit.

24:15.166 --> 24:16.916
The generator should give it enough power.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.500
-Yeah, but for how long?
-Long enough.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.458
Maybe. Punch it.

24:25.083 --> 24:26.916
I'm up for anything, but this is crazy.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.708
Yeah, so is Steve Rogers.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.375
-You okay?
-ROGERS: Yep.

24:40.458 --> 24:42.375
Good, because we don't have all day.

24:45.291 --> 24:47.791
-ROGERS: Now, where's Peggy?
-She drew the high card.

24:54.458 --> 24:56.583
Its tentacles appear to be growing.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.875
At the rate it's spreading,
it could devour Europe.

25:02.958 --> 25:04.333
If I can get to the controls,

25:04.416 --> 25:06.666
I can transpose the ingress
and do science stuff.

25:06.750 --> 25:09.125
You mean transpose
the polarity and reverse the suction?

25:09.208 --> 25:10.500
Being the genius is my thing.

25:13.458 --> 25:16.166
Show-off. Come on,
come on, speak to me, baby.

25:17.041 --> 25:19.833
-And everything's in German. Great.
-Well, figure it out.

25:30.375 --> 25:32.958
Red, green, blue...
Who paints a button blue?

25:33.041 --> 25:36.958
Don't tell me the American playboy
needs help pushing buttons.

25:37.041 --> 25:39.041
Hedy Lamarr
and I spent a weekend together,

25:39.125 --> 25:40.833
but she wasn't teaching me German!

25:56.416 --> 25:58.625
-Steve?
-Did you miss me?

25:58.708 --> 26:01.708
-Every second.
-I told you it was indestructible.

26:05.166 --> 26:07.083
You were saying, Howard?

26:08.958 --> 26:12.041
Oh, wow. Who ordered the calamari?

26:28.333 --> 26:30.041
-Steve!
-ROGERS: On it!

26:38.125 --> 26:39.791
Go get 'em, Steve!

26:42.958 --> 26:45.000
I can't close it!
This thing is holding it open!

26:45.083 --> 26:47.208
Then I'll push it back to hell!

26:53.291 --> 26:54.500
ROGERS: Peggy!

26:57.750 --> 26:58.875
No, no, no!

27:03.500 --> 27:06.375
-Peggy, no!
-I have to. I can end this.

27:07.083 --> 27:08.708
You owe me a dance lesson.

27:08.791 --> 27:11.958
Yes, Saturday night.

28:20.291 --> 28:21.416
-FURY: Ma'am.
-(PEGGY GRUNTS)

28:21.500 --> 28:23.166
Please, put down the sword.

28:25.333 --> 28:28.291
Uh, sir? That's Captain Carter.

28:28.375 --> 28:29.791
Where's Steve Rogers?

28:30.625 --> 28:35.041
The war ended almost 70 years ago.

28:38.291 --> 28:39.625
FURY: You going to be okay?

28:40.416 --> 28:42.000
Of course.

28:43.208 --> 28:44.750
We won the war.

28:46.750 --> 28:50.166
WATCHER: <i>Her one choice</i>
<i>gave birth to a whole new history</i>

28:50.250 --> 28:53.250
<i>and gave the multiverse a new hero.</i>

28:53.333 --> 28:56.500
<i>As for me, these are my stories.</i>

28:56.583 --> 29:02.666
<i>I observe all that transpires here,</i>
<i>but I do not, cannot, will not interfere.</i>

29:02.750 --> 29:04.125
<i>For I am...</i>

29:05.083 --> 29:06.625
<i>the Watcher.</i>
