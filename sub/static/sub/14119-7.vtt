(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:32.766 --> 00:34.633
TOUR GUIDE:
Miami University of Ohio

00:34.635 --> 00:36.735
is so excited
to have you here.

00:36.737 --> 00:40.639
Just over there is the stadium
where you'll be giving
your commencement address.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.909
Oh boy, I just gotta say
this is a remarkable honor.

00:43.911 --> 00:46.645
You didn't think
you were going
to Miami, Florida, did you?

00:46.647 --> 00:47.913
Now why would
I think that, huh?

00:47.915 --> 00:49.615
I'd have to be a moron
to think that.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.650
You school is called
Miami of Ohio.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.852
My plane ticket
was to Oxford, Ohio.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.487
Did you think I would
just get on a plane

00:55.489 --> 00:57.256
without even having any idea
where I was going?

00:57.258 --> 00:59.925
ANNOUNCER:
<i>This is the final call</i>
<i>for flight 1760...</i>

00:59.927 --> 01:01.593
Ohio?

01:01.595 --> 01:03.529
Well, some people
get confused.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.064
Man, those people are morons,

01:05.066 --> 01:07.399
and I feel sorry for them.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.934
MARQUESS: What are you doing?

01:08.936 --> 01:11.737
Mike said we could
solve a mystery
while he's gone.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.806
Well, shouldn't we wait
for Yung?

01:13.808 --> 01:16.341
Uh, she's trying to
thaw a piece of chicken.

01:16.343 --> 01:18.444
She said to start with...
Without her.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.045
She said,
"I should run point."

01:20.047 --> 01:22.414
She said,
"Run point on this one."
Her words!

01:22.416 --> 01:24.349
I can't tell
if you're being serious

01:24.351 --> 01:27.386
but for some reason,
I believe you, you're
selling it. Read the note.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.822
"You made bet, you lose bet,

01:29.824 --> 01:32.291
"you don't pay money,
I take girl."

01:32.293 --> 01:35.194
That sounds less
like a mystery
and more like a threat.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.395
Oh, it is a threat.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.197
You know my friend Gregor?

01:38.199 --> 01:39.631
Umm... Should I?

01:39.633 --> 01:41.633
Certainly.
He's a famous gangster.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.569
Like, he does
serious horrible stuff.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.437
-Murder, human trafficking...
-(GASPS)

01:45.439 --> 01:48.574
But, also stuff
that shouldn't even
be illegal.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.109
Like gambling and drugs.

01:50.111 --> 01:53.278
So, a flawed human being,
just like the rest of us.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.580
I think he wrote that note.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.181
So is that note for you?

01:56.183 --> 01:57.549
Did he take Yung?

01:57.551 --> 02:00.586
Huh? Oh, well,
I hadn't considered that.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.855
Uh, well, you know,

02:02.857 --> 02:05.524
that, that, that might be
what this is about.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.025
Now that I think about it,

02:07.027 --> 02:10.095
I, uh, I remember I put
20 grand on the Sugar Bowl

02:10.097 --> 02:11.864
and then some freshman kicker

02:11.866 --> 02:15.467
misses a
three-yard field goal.
(LAUGHS)

02:15.469 --> 02:17.603
College kids,
they're so stupid.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.506
And now a human trafficker
has Yung?

02:20.508 --> 02:22.207
We have to call the police.

02:22.209 --> 02:25.544
Oh, no, no, no.
He just wants his money.
We can do this on our own.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.579
No, we should call Michael.

02:27.581 --> 02:31.984
Oh, no way. Mike trusted us
to take care of his daughter,
and you failed.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.686
What? How did I fail?
I didn't do anything.

02:34.688 --> 02:38.090
Oh, well, come on now,
this is just a bunch
of he said, she said.

02:38.092 --> 02:41.226
The point is,
we can get her back
without involving Mike.

02:41.228 --> 02:42.861
Okay, fine!

02:42.863 --> 02:45.097
Just call Gregor
and let's get
this thing settled.

02:46.566 --> 02:49.234
You think the kids
at Miami of Ohio ever get mad

02:49.236 --> 02:51.170
that the other
Miami University
doesn't have to,

02:51.172 --> 02:53.772
have to say "Miami of Florida"
in their school name?

02:53.774 --> 02:55.807
-I don't care, focus!
-No, no, I should.

02:55.809 --> 02:59.011
And I'm not gonna pretend
that "he said, she said" thing
wasn't offensive.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.513
(LAUGHING)
No, it was pretty offensive.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.115
Gregor, it's me.

03:03.117 --> 03:04.917
Do you have Yung Hee?

03:04.919 --> 03:06.919
This is your fault
as much as mine.

03:06.921 --> 03:09.688
I have a gambling problem,
you're an enabler.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.191
Who are the Spurs
playing tonight, by the way?

03:12.193 --> 03:14.359
Really, I'll take them
and the points.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.661
-Pigeon!
-Huh?

03:15.663 --> 03:18.630
Listen, Gregor, we need
Yung Hee back.

03:19.399 --> 03:21.133
Great!

03:21.135 --> 03:23.435
-He's gonna give her back?
-Absolutely!

03:23.437 --> 03:25.270
On an unrelated note, uh,

03:25.272 --> 03:27.706
do you have $20,000?

03:27.708 --> 03:30.509
MIKE: Red leather,
yellow leather,
red leather, yellow leather,

03:30.511 --> 03:32.311
red yellow leather...
(STAMMERS)

03:32.313 --> 03:33.512
Red... Oh God.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.280
MAN: Excuse me, Mr. Tyson,

03:35.282 --> 03:37.149
can I get a copy
of your speech
to put in the teleprompter?

03:37.151 --> 03:38.317
I didn't write a speech,

03:38.319 --> 03:40.686
I'm gonna speak
extemporaneously

03:40.688 --> 03:42.588
from my heart.

03:42.590 --> 03:45.157
Peter pepper
picked the pepper, piper...

03:45.159 --> 03:46.925
Peter... Oh, God.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.560
PIGEON: What about his
championship belt?

03:48.562 --> 03:50.495
It's gotta be worth 20 grand.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.831
He wears sweat pants,
he doesn't need a belt.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.567
No! He worked
his whole life for that.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.970
Oh, wow. I don't understand

03:57.972 --> 04:00.138
why you don't
wanna get Yung back.

04:00.140 --> 04:02.007
Why are you so anti-Yung?

04:02.009 --> 04:03.842
No, I'm not
doing this with you.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.911
Here, we'll take
one of his Rolexes.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.213
He has eight,
maybe he won't notice.

04:08.215 --> 04:10.782
-PIGEON: Is it because
you hate Asians?
-Stop it.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.684
-Huh? What's the matter
with Asians?
-No!

04:12.686 --> 04:14.653
-I'm seriously asking
the question. Why?
-Well, I'm not answering!

04:14.655 --> 04:16.054
-Why do you hate
Asian people?
-Stop it!

04:16.056 --> 04:17.122
Come on now!

04:18.591 --> 04:19.925
GREGOR: Ah, yes!

04:19.927 --> 04:22.928
You will be big hit
at tonight's party!

04:22.930 --> 04:25.264
You won't be needing
these anymore.

04:25.266 --> 04:28.133
The second my dad finds out
where I am, you're dead.

04:28.135 --> 04:30.502
(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

04:30.504 --> 04:32.671
You make me laugh.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.239
Thank you for that.

04:34.241 --> 04:37.209
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

04:37.211 --> 04:39.278
YUNG: Dad!

04:39.280 --> 04:40.946
TV ANNOUNCER:
<i>Welcome to our live coverage</i>

04:40.948 --> 04:43.015
<i>of the Miami University</i>
<i>commencement address</i>

04:43.017 --> 04:45.384
<i>given tonight by Mike Tyson.</i>

04:45.386 --> 04:47.286
I hope he's not nervous.

04:47.288 --> 04:49.154
ANNOUNCER:
<i>And thanks for tuning in</i>
<i>to the Commencement Channel.</i>

04:49.156 --> 04:52.858
<i>Seriously. We didn't think</i>
<i>anybody would ever watch.</i>

04:52.860 --> 04:55.193
PIGEON: Now listen.
Gregor may get spooked by you,

04:55.195 --> 04:58.330
so just hang by the bar
and let me handle this.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.698
Gimme the Rolex.

05:02.769 --> 05:04.403
What do you want drink?

05:04.405 --> 05:07.639
Hmm? Oh.
No, thank you, I'm fine.
Just waiting for a friend.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.341
Four drink minimum.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.310
Four? My God!

05:11.312 --> 05:13.045
Okay, I'll take four waters.

05:13.579 --> 05:15.247
No deal.

05:15.249 --> 05:16.615
Ah, come on, Gregor.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.950
I can't leave here
without the girl.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.786
No deal!

05:20.788 --> 05:23.322
Well, that's an ugly side
I didn't think he had.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.025
What happened? Where's Yung?

05:27.027 --> 05:29.494
Oh. Okay, listen.
Yung Hee?

05:29.496 --> 05:30.929
Um, well, she's dead.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.298
-Oh my God! What?
-I know.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.834
-In many ways, it's a tragedy.
-(GASPING)

05:35.836 --> 05:37.469
-We have to call Michael.
-No!

05:37.471 --> 05:39.104
No, a phone call's
too impersonal.

05:39.106 --> 05:42.774
Let's go home,
and we'll Skype him.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.811
Hello graduates
of Ohio University in Miami.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.880
(CHEERING ON TV)

05:48.882 --> 05:51.983
-Looks like your friend
cannot afford you.
-Shh!

05:51.985 --> 05:54.052
I bet you guys think
I'm gonna talk to you

05:54.054 --> 05:57.589
about getting back up
after getting knocked down
in life.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.591
But I'm not.

05:59.593 --> 06:02.027
I'm gonna talk to you
about hats.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.629
Not those square hats
like the one
you guys are wearing,

06:04.631 --> 06:07.999
which, by the way,
I can't believe you're all
wearing the same hat.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.936
(CHUCKLES)
That is tripping
me out, man.

06:10.938 --> 06:14.239
Does everybody here
wear the same hat in Miami?

06:14.241 --> 06:17.376
It's like a square hat
with a string.

06:17.378 --> 06:21.046
I never, ever in my life
seen a hat like that.

06:21.048 --> 06:25.050
Are you all wearing
the same clothes too?

06:25.052 --> 06:27.085
Is this some kind
of religious school?

06:27.087 --> 06:29.721
<i>What the</i> (BLEEP)
<i>is going on here?</i>

06:29.723 --> 06:31.656
I love Mike Tyson.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.058
I'll be her guide.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.693
I'll find her
in the spirit world
and guide her.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.194
Oh, she must be so scared!

06:36.196 --> 06:38.196
Yes, yes.
But don't rush that though.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.599
You have to give her
some time to adjust
to the spirit world.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.635
You know, maybe we should
hold off telling Mike
for a bit too.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.738
What? No!
He has to know
as soon as possible.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.640
Ah! God! I have to pee.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.342
I drank four waters
in two minutes.

06:50.344 --> 06:52.644
-Well, why'd you drink that?
-What do mean why?

06:52.646 --> 06:53.812
I paid for them.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.614
Oh my god, you're so cheap.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.049
-What, are you gonna run out
of ghost dollars?
-Oh, stop it.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.552
I have to go to the bathroom.
I'm gonna explode!

07:00.554 --> 07:02.220
Let's go in here.

07:02.222 --> 07:05.223
MARQUESS:
Oh, that's not predictable.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.559
Okay, Tingle, how much
for a lap dance?

07:07.561 --> 07:08.894
Where's your lap?

07:08.896 --> 07:11.730
Ha ha ha!
Trust me, we'll figure it out!

07:11.732 --> 07:13.465
-Thirty.
-Oh, yeah?

07:13.467 --> 07:16.134
How much for you
to come live with me
and my ghost friend,

07:16.136 --> 07:18.770
and pretend to be Mike Tyson's
18-year-old daughter?

07:18.772 --> 07:19.938
For how long?

07:19.940 --> 07:21.072
The rest of your life.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.208
It's 10,000
for a lifetime move-in.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.777
Can I have a dollar?
They have
a bathroom attendant.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.846
I'm out of "ghost dollars."

07:27.848 --> 07:30.382
Hang on,
I think Tingle can help us.

07:30.384 --> 07:32.717
Tingle? Her name is Tingle?

07:32.719 --> 07:34.252
PIGEON: But it could be...

07:34.254 --> 07:35.554
Yung Hee!

07:35.556 --> 07:39.157
That is if you think
this watch is worth $10,000.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.328
The hat I wanna speak of today

07:43.330 --> 07:44.896
are invisible hats.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.398
I'm wearing one right now.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.767
You see, I used to wear
a fighting hat.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.335
All my life I had it on.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.838
And I was always fighting
because of my fighting hat.

07:52.840 --> 07:56.808
And so everyone thinks,
"Mike Tyson,
he's just a fighter."

07:56.810 --> 07:59.377
But one day I decided
to take that hat off

07:59.379 --> 08:02.247
and now I wear my new hat.
Can you see it?

08:03.783 --> 08:05.750
It's a mystery solving hat.

08:05.752 --> 08:09.020
Like the kind
Sherlock Holmes wears,
but it's invisible.

08:09.022 --> 08:13.124
So it doesn't itch,
or look like I'm wearing
a (BLEEP) costume.

08:13.126 --> 08:17.629
And so now,
instead of getting into fights
because of my fighting hat,

08:17.631 --> 08:19.531
I solve mysteries,

08:19.533 --> 08:24.269
because I'm wearing
the same kinda hat
that Sherlock Holmes wears.

08:24.271 --> 08:27.272
My point is that
you can wear a hat
for a very long time

08:27.274 --> 08:29.374
and everyone think
that's who you are.

08:29.376 --> 08:32.310
But it's just a hat
you're wearing,
you can take it off.

08:32.312 --> 08:36.948
In fact, hats are the easiest
items of clothing to take off.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.984
You have been students
your whole life.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.186
It's time to take
those hats off.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.121
Take 'em off, throw 'em away,

08:43.123 --> 08:44.990
because you're not
students anymore,

08:44.992 --> 08:46.691
you graduated!

08:46.693 --> 08:48.793
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

08:48.795 --> 08:51.029
Damn, I didn't mean
literally take them off.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.932
College kids are so stupid!

08:53.934 --> 08:55.867
-(CHEERING ON TV)
-(TV TURNS OFF)

08:55.869 --> 08:58.737
-You are free, you can leave.
-What?

08:58.739 --> 09:00.872
No more human trafficking,

09:00.874 --> 09:03.775
it's time for me
to wear a new hat.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.044
What hat will I wear?

09:06.046 --> 09:08.513
The sky is the limit!

09:08.515 --> 09:12.017
GREGOR:
I've never been so happy
in my life!

09:12.019 --> 09:14.386
YUNG:
I knew my dad would save me.

09:17.356 --> 09:20.892
This is ridiculous!
It won't work!
She's not a goldfish.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.727
Well, maybe he won't
ask for her.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.997
And if he does,
we can have her stand
far away.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.899
-(SKYPE CHIMES)
-Oh, we're up!

09:27.901 --> 09:30.769
<i>Hey, fellas.</i>
<i>My commencement speech</i>
<i>was great. Did you see it?</i>

09:30.771 --> 09:32.370
Ah, man, we missed it.

09:32.372 --> 09:33.572
Yeah, turns out,

09:33.574 --> 09:35.206
you don't have the
Commencement Channel here.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.675
<i>Man that seems ludicrous.</i>

09:36.677 --> 09:39.044
<i>I'll call the cable company</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

09:39.812 --> 09:41.379
<i>Where's Yung Hee?</i>

09:41.381 --> 09:44.182
I can't be party to this.
Michael, your daughter is...

09:44.184 --> 09:47.519
-Hi, Dad!
<i>-Hi, Yung!</i>
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

09:47.521 --> 09:49.087
Huh? What's that, Mike?

09:49.089 --> 09:50.622
What? We can barely hear you.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.390
Thank God you're alive!

09:52.392 --> 09:54.492
Who told you I was dead?

09:54.494 --> 09:57.596
Well, Gregor
strongly implied it,

09:57.598 --> 10:02.367
and we had to start
the healing process
for ourselves.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.502
Ugh.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.611
Ahh!

10:13.679 --> 10:16.114
Jesus (BLEEP) Christ!

10:16.116 --> 10:18.950
Um, who's the woman
in my bedroom?

10:19.652 --> 10:21.653
That's... That's Tingle.

10:21.655 --> 10:22.988
Who's Tingle?

10:22.990 --> 10:25.156
Why, she is the newest member

10:25.158 --> 10:27.726
of the
Mike Tyson Mystery Team!

10:27.728 --> 10:29.494
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

10:49.382 --> 10:52.317
Red leather, yellow leather,
red leather, yellow leather.
