WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:02.736
ADAM:
Who can forget the gruff,

00:02.803 --> 00:04.505
no-nonsense gym teachers
of the '80s?

00:04.572 --> 00:06.307
They were true
athletic authorities

00:06.374 --> 00:09.443
who demanded respect
and ruled our lives
with an iron whistle.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.113
None more than
William Penn Academy's
Coach Mellor.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.982
Well, aren't you
a tall glass of Gatorade?

00:15.049 --> 00:16.484
Go get 'em, Ricky!

00:18.352 --> 00:19.920
After a great deal
of legal wrangling,

00:19.987 --> 00:22.223
I am excited introduce
a new unit...

00:22.290 --> 00:24.058
Full-contact Red Rover.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.060
Oh!
Ugh!

00:26.127 --> 00:28.996
Did I hear somebody say
"full

00:29.063 --> 00:31.999
But like clockwork,
my smother would
always save me

00:32.066 --> 00:33.601
from the dangers
of physical movement.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.937
I forced Principal Ball
to give me an advanced copy
of all your units,

00:37.004 --> 00:40.074
and my baby is not doing
anything full contact.

00:40.141 --> 00:43.344
It's all very embarrassing,
but so worth it.

00:43.411 --> 00:47.014
It sure was, till one fateful
day when everything changed.

00:47.081 --> 00:49.983
Today, we will be climbing
the celebrated gym rope.

00:50.050 --> 00:53.454
Fear not.
This inch and a half
of blue cushion

00:53.521 --> 00:54.922
will probably break
your fall.

00:54.988 --> 00:56.724
Goldfarb, kick us off.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.058
Sorry, Coach.

00:58.126 --> 01:01.195
My old lady likes to keep
all this on safe ground.

01:01.262 --> 01:04.365
She'll be here
in three, two, one...

01:04.432 --> 01:07.000
Mama!

01:07.067 --> 01:09.103
Face it, Goldfarb,
she's a no-show.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.105
Time to let the rope
get to know every part of you.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.974
Thing is, my mom's
doing this whole Bevolution
to reinvent herself

01:14.041 --> 01:15.643
and kind of dropped the ball
on her Schmoopie.

01:15.709 --> 01:16.910
Move!

01:16.977 --> 01:19.280
For the very first time,
I was Momless

01:19.347 --> 01:21.615
and had to face
the infamous rope on my own.

01:21.682 --> 01:26.019
And like many gym scrubs
before me, I sucked real bad.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.788
Coach believes in you,
kiddo!

01:27.855 --> 01:30.558
Dig down deep!
Failure is not...

01:30.624 --> 01:32.460
And he's coming down!

01:33.827 --> 01:35.095
I'm alive!

01:35.163 --> 01:36.630
Oh, no.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.132
Coach, you okay?

01:38.199 --> 01:40.401
Pain is just weakness
leaving the body.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.803
Now, make room for me
to acrobatically

01:42.870 --> 01:45.273
leap to my feet
like a jungle cat.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.111
Should I call
Nurse Steve?

01:51.179 --> 01:53.847
No need!
Just a tiny sprain!

01:53.914 --> 01:55.783
It is not a tiny sprain!

01:55.849 --> 01:57.718
I've ruptured my C2 vertebra.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.321
As a result, I can no longer
aggressively sneeze

02:00.388 --> 02:03.056
or use my full head
to properly whistle.

02:03.123 --> 02:06.194
Man, I feel like this is kinda
partially my fault, Coach.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.895
Oh, it is 100% your fault.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.198
And as such, I will unfairly
put you on a dodgeball team

02:10.264 --> 02:11.532
with a bunch
of weak-armed scrubs

02:11.599 --> 02:13.434
so you get yours.

02:13.501 --> 02:14.535
Game on!

02:14.602 --> 02:15.603
Ah!

02:15.669 --> 02:17.338
Let me just grab
a couple ball...

02:17.405 --> 02:19.573
Who did that?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.542
Who laughed at me?

02:21.609 --> 02:23.844
Admit it!
I can't turn my head,
so I couldn't see.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.513
You will not laugh at Coach!

02:25.579 --> 02:27.615
You will respect your
sports leader...

02:27.681 --> 02:28.916
Ah!

02:28.982 --> 02:30.718
* I'm twisted up inside

02:30.784 --> 02:34.288
* But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

02:36.757 --> 02:38.226
* I don't know the future

02:38.292 --> 02:41.995
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:42.062 --> 02:44.465
ADAM:
It was March 21st,
1980-something,

02:44.532 --> 02:47.368
the week my sister hit an
important college milestone,

02:47.435 --> 02:49.270
growing to hate her roommate.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.104
And the tipping point...

02:52.640 --> 02:54.408
A box of chewy fruit snacks.

02:54.475 --> 02:55.776
Have you seen
my Shark Bites?

02:55.843 --> 02:57.545
I've seen no Shark Bites.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.847
Weird, because, um,
when I went to class,

02:59.913 --> 03:01.549
my Shark Bites were here.

03:01.615 --> 03:04.252
And now, my Shark Bites
are gone!

03:04.318 --> 03:06.754
Are you, like, suggesting
I ate your Shark Bites?

03:06.820 --> 03:09.022
Oh, I'm saying
you ate my Shark Bites.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.624
You owe me Shark Bites!

03:10.691 --> 03:12.726
And you owe me
half a Taco Bell taco
I left out last night!

03:12.793 --> 03:14.328
So, you admit it.
Oh, I admit it.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.897
I ate them all.
And my tummy
is super jacked up,

03:16.964 --> 03:18.766
but it was worth it
to even the score.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.801
I will eat everything
you own!

03:20.868 --> 03:22.035
Ah!

03:22.102 --> 03:23.271
Stop it!
No!

03:24.838 --> 03:27.275
Yep. Living on top of each
other finally got to them.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.510
Really?

03:29.577 --> 03:31.044
It's for class,
so, suck it.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.646
You know,
I'm getting really tired

03:32.713 --> 03:34.214
of how crazy
passive-aggressive
you are!

03:34.282 --> 03:36.950
Me? You purposely
didn't refill the ice tray.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.753
I couldn't because somebody
made it all crusty

03:39.820 --> 03:41.255
from the jello shots
that she made in it.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.056
I have no memory
of that entire night,

03:43.123 --> 03:45.259
so I win this argument.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.460
Did you?

03:46.527 --> 03:50.130
No! My special ice tray!

03:50.197 --> 03:54.835
And things went from bad
to worse when Erica came home
to a scrunchie on the door.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.705
Back before texting, this
message meant your roommate

03:57.771 --> 03:59.673
had romantic company,
so go away.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.343
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

04:02.410 --> 04:04.645
Um, hello!
Scrunchie on the door.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.179
Just open up.
I'm exhausted.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.915
Oh, I'd love to help you,

04:07.981 --> 04:10.818
but I'm entertaining Hector.
He plays the flute.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.085
I don't want to know
Hector facts.

04:12.152 --> 04:13.354
I want to sleep in my own bed.

04:13.421 --> 04:14.955
I'm sorry, but it's
the scrunchie rule.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.625
Go sleep in the
common room with
the other loveless losers.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.059
Bye!

04:19.126 --> 04:21.295
Wait! The only space
in there is next to the
leaky microwave!

04:21.362 --> 04:23.030
Then go home!

04:23.096 --> 04:24.498
Bye!

04:26.300 --> 04:28.569
With no bed to sleep in,
that's just what
my sister did.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.103
Such bull crap.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.739
I used to be best friends
with my roommate,

04:31.805 --> 04:34.141
and now we fight over who left
the cap off the toothpaste.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.943
It was you, huh?
It was obviously me,

04:36.009 --> 04:38.145
but that's not the point.
Okay, I think I may
have a solution.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.880
When I went to visit
my cousin at UCLA,

04:39.947 --> 04:41.749
I found out that there's
one thing that overrules

04:41.815 --> 04:43.751
the scrunchie.
An out-of-town guest.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.653
I mean, you can't
make a visitor sleep
in the common room.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.588
That's just rude.
And it's perfect.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.723
All I need is
an out-of-town guest,
and I win!

04:49.790 --> 04:53.193
How 'bout a foxy one
who no longer needs
his asthma nebulizer

04:53.260 --> 04:55.663
because he went through
a year-long course of shots
for dust mites?

04:56.830 --> 04:58.265
That was supposed to
sound cooler than it did.

04:58.732 --> 04:59.900
Gah!

04:59.967 --> 05:01.902
These CDs are impossible
to open!

05:01.969 --> 05:04.372
Yes, Barry! Come back to
college with me this weekend!

05:04.438 --> 05:06.674
Him?
He's the awful answer
to my problems.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.610
You know how you always
annoy me on purpose
and drive me crazy?

05:09.677 --> 05:12.346
It is my greatest joy in life.
Which reminds me...

05:12.413 --> 05:13.414
Hyah!

05:13.481 --> 05:15.182
Yes!
You are the worst!

05:15.248 --> 05:16.950
Can you channel that
hateful, abrasive energy

05:17.017 --> 05:18.218
at my roommate
and drive her away?

05:18.285 --> 05:20.588
Child's play, but my skills
don't come cheap.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.190
See to it.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.092
Sure, I'll get crackin'
on this while you pack.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.326
Sucker!

05:26.394 --> 05:28.762
What about me? I can be
mildly irritating sometimes.

05:28.829 --> 05:29.930
Oh, well,
if you want to help,

05:29.997 --> 05:32.633
you can open this
because it's impossible.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.969
Okay, fine, but I'm...
I'm not gonna clean up
the soda that Barry spilled.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.571
I'm just gonna blot it,
okay?

05:37.638 --> 05:39.807
Just in case anyone slips
and hurts themselves.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.876
I'm off to Dave Kim's.
He just got
Super Mario Bros. 3.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.045
So, chances are,
I'm coming home Sunday night

05:45.112 --> 05:46.780
with some wicked
Nintendo thumb.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.949
Enjoy your Italian game,
Schmoopaloo.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.818
Ooh, Mom, could you
do me a solid

05:50.884 --> 05:52.219
and whip up some
of our lemon loaf?

05:52.285 --> 05:53.454
Check your backpack.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.523
No! A fresh one
for Coach Mellor.

05:55.589 --> 05:56.857
He got hurt pretty bad,

05:56.924 --> 05:59.359
and it's sorta my fault
'cause I fell off a rope,

05:59.427 --> 06:01.595
which is sorta your fault,
'cause you didn't bail me out.

06:01.662 --> 06:04.097
That's on me. I was just
trying to improve my life

06:04.164 --> 06:06.133
by reading a book
on boundaries.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.668
Did you know I love you
too much?

06:07.735 --> 06:09.903
Does this goodbye feel
too long to you guys, too?

06:09.970 --> 06:12.005
Well, enjoy the house
all to yourselves.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.943
You know, he's right.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.412
All my squishy-tushes
are gone for the weekend.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.180
Listen to that.
What do you hear?

06:22.082 --> 06:23.484
Just your loud breathing.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.753
You know, it weirdly sounds
both wet and dry.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.120
Exactly.

06:27.187 --> 06:30.157
No kids to ask me for money
or touch the thermostat.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.026
No one to feed or clothe or
tickle their backs to sleep...

06:33.093 --> 06:35.496
Which is a good thing.
It's why you got
the whole Bevformation.

06:35.563 --> 06:38.265
Bevolution.
And you're right.

06:38.331 --> 06:42.436
I... I need to accept the fact
that soon I will have
no one to take care of.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.572
Look at me. I promise.

06:44.638 --> 06:49.510
When our kids leave, I will
never, ever wash a dish.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.479
That's my gift to you.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.313
ADAM: With little
prospects at home,

06:53.380 --> 06:56.950
my mom decided the best
prospect for mothering
was elsewhere.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.820
Oh, hi.
Welcome to Mellor Manor.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.121
I heard you weren't
feeling great,

07:01.188 --> 07:02.856
so I whipped up
a healing lemon loaf.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.191
Bring it in.
Bring it in.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.393
I can't wait to mash that up
and drink it through a straw.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.162
Where are my manners?

07:09.229 --> 07:10.598
Do you want some coffee
and cheese?

07:10.664 --> 07:13.333
Oh, my God, Rick,
are you okay?

07:13.400 --> 07:14.835
I'm tip-top!

07:14.902 --> 07:17.004
Aside from the fact that
I gotta sleep standing up

07:17.070 --> 07:19.840
and I can't
take this shirt off.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.975
Isn't there someone
who can take care of you?

07:22.042 --> 07:24.144
I'm perfectly capable
of taking care of myself.

07:24.211 --> 07:29.517
Aside from washing, eating,
and opening damn cheese!

07:29.583 --> 07:30.984
You are coming home
with me.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.319
I could never intrude
like that.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.954
Oh, intrude away.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.624
My house is empty
and lifeless this weekend.
It's no bother.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.091
You think you could pack
a bag for me?

07:38.158 --> 07:41.261
I have limited range
of motion.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.230
Also, I'm so scared
to be alone.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.900
I can't tell you how badly
I needed to hear that
just now.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.369
ADAM: As my mom
found a replacement
for her children,

07:49.436 --> 07:52.172
my sister found the solution
to get back at her roommate.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.942
Hey, bad news.
Me and Hector
saw Road House,

07:55.008 --> 07:56.510
so it's for sure another
scrunchie night,

07:56.577 --> 07:58.278
'cause, you know, Swayze.

07:58.345 --> 08:01.715
Save it for your hair
because I have my own guest
from out of town.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.884
That's me!

08:03.951 --> 08:05.218
Ooh!
VALLEY ERICA: Hey!

08:05.285 --> 08:06.920
My super cute outfits!

08:06.987 --> 08:10.357
Sorry. I need a place for my
Drakkar Noir line of shampoos,

08:10.423 --> 08:13.927
soaps, shaving creams,
and of course, cologne.

08:13.994 --> 08:17.397
Oh, no. It smells like
the boys' cabin at Camp Ramah
before the Shabbat social!

08:17.464 --> 08:19.266
I guess the bad news
is for you,

08:19.332 --> 08:22.903
because he's staying
the whole weekend,
which means you go.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.071
I'll grab the rest
of your colognes

08:24.137 --> 08:26.039
and ninja weaponry
from the car.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.976
Ugh! How did you live with
your sister for so long?

08:29.042 --> 08:31.912
I was a baby
for the first part, so
I don't remember anything.

08:31.979 --> 08:34.314
But once I was able to
form memories, it got awful.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.383
So, I get it.
She used to be so cool.

08:36.449 --> 08:37.751
And now, she's...
Not cool!

08:37.818 --> 08:38.852
Totally. She, like...

08:38.919 --> 08:40.287
Sucks.
...sucks.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.255
What?

08:42.322 --> 08:43.791
Did we just finish
each other's...

08:43.857 --> 08:44.958
Sentences?
...sentences?

08:46.126 --> 08:47.561
Wow! We did it again!

08:47.628 --> 08:49.863
Your Drakkar suddenly
smells good to me.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.432
My sweat activates it.

08:52.499 --> 08:53.601
Awesome.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.304
'Sup?
Open up!

08:57.370 --> 09:00.007
Can't.
Your roomie has company.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.575
You?
Me.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.711
Ew!
Yeah.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.980
Erica, you cannot scrunchie
my disgusting out-of-town
guest!

09:07.047 --> 09:08.582
That is against the rules!

09:08.649 --> 09:11.418
* I just wanna use
your love tonight *

09:11.484 --> 09:13.153
And turn off
that sexy mix tape!

09:13.220 --> 09:16.824
Geoff made me that tape!
Not to mention... Ew!

09:16.890 --> 09:19.459
ADAM: Meanwhile, my mom
was making Coach
feel right at home.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.194
Holy cheesy seafood!

09:21.261 --> 09:23.831
Your shrimp Parm is
the Super Bowl of all meals.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.734
Easy, sweetie.
You're getting sauce
all over your white shirt.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.268
Here, put on
this clean one.

09:28.335 --> 09:31.204
Oh! Oh, it's still warm
from the dryer!

09:31.271 --> 09:33.373
Finish up 'cause I got
Push Pops for dessert.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.142
Push Pops? Score!

09:35.208 --> 09:36.443
Ow! I'm okay.

09:36.509 --> 09:39.312
Hey, Bevy! Hey, Barr.
Hey, Mr. G.

09:39.379 --> 09:42.015
This isn't our moron.
This is a grown man
with a neck brace.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.383
Good eye.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.285
Literally the first weekend
that our kids are gone,

09:45.352 --> 09:46.620
you're already
replacing them?

09:46.687 --> 09:48.656
Please. I'm not trying
to replace anybody.

09:48.722 --> 09:51.859
He's eating all my food
and wearing Barry's
dumb orange shirt.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.160
Your face is dumb.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.795
What?
Nothing.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.363
Don't listen to him.
Why don't you run upstairs
to your room,

09:56.429 --> 09:58.198
and I'll bring you
your Push Pop later, okay?

09:58.265 --> 09:59.700
Cherry. Don't forget.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.235
Bevy, this is insane.
What...
What are you doing?

10:02.302 --> 10:05.172
Oh, stop. I'm just helping
a coach in need.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.807
I changed my mind.
I want grape.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.175
Where are you going?

10:08.241 --> 10:10.077
To fix this!

10:10.143 --> 10:13.313
Yeah, well,
now, you know what? I...
I want strawberry. No! Wait.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.381
I don't know.
Surprise me.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.448
But anything but orange.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.854
ADAM:
With Coach Mellor
living under our roof,

10:20.921 --> 10:23.356
my mom was excited
to be smothering again.

10:23.423 --> 10:26.526
Hope you're hungry
for some noodle kugel
and a smoked fish medley.

10:26.593 --> 10:29.196
No dinner for Coach.
I got a mutiny below deck.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.832
Did you make today?
Did you make poo

10:31.899 --> 10:34.234
Any poo 'Cause that's
poison in the body, you know.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.737
Suppose Coach
could use some prunes.
Mmm.

10:36.804 --> 10:39.272
Great news!
I solved everything!
You're welcome.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.108
ADAM:
Oh, yes, my dad went big.

10:41.174 --> 10:44.211
He brought in Coach Rick's
massive older brother,
Coach Nick.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.079
Wait. This is your
big idea, Murray?

10:46.146 --> 10:48.816
You try to fix things
by calling his actual family?

10:49.817 --> 10:51.484
Right, I'm the crazy one.

10:51.551 --> 10:54.221
Look, the last thing I need
is for my brother
to take care of me.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.223
You wouldn't say that
if you tried my soup!

10:56.289 --> 10:58.191
Boys, stop.
I see what's happening here.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.626
Coach Rick has a hurt neck,

10:59.693 --> 11:02.896
but Coach Nick's heart
is in a lot more pain.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.431
Whatever.
Doesn't matter.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.166
No, in this house,
our feelings matter.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.769
I feel they both
should go.

11:08.836 --> 11:12.773
Shh. Talk to your little
brother, Coach Nick.
Use your words.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.876
When you didn't ask for
my help, it made me sad.

11:15.943 --> 11:19.579
'Cause, you know, my love
for you is big as my pecs.

11:19.646 --> 11:22.082
That's, like, the biggest love
a man can have.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.384
Well, that's gotta make you
feel special, Coach Rick.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.787
Maybe special enough to
share your feelings?

11:28.655 --> 11:30.290
Well...

11:30.357 --> 11:32.893
It's like my neck
is so jacked up,
I can't even blow my whistle.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.628
Bro, you never been
so real to me before.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.198
I guess it's my turn
to get even realer.

11:39.399 --> 11:40.633
I don't have a home.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.502
Oh, boy.
Kathleen kicked me out

11:42.569 --> 11:44.972
'cause I didn't notice
she changed her hair.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.407
My God, Coach Nick,
where have you been staying?

11:47.474 --> 11:50.043
At the gym. I sleep
on the weight bench

11:50.110 --> 11:51.644
and use a kettle bell
as a pillow.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.147
You can stay with me in my
junior single condo, brother.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.116
With one tiny bed?

11:56.183 --> 11:58.318
No, no. You're both
staying here for the weekend.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.920
I won't take "no"
for an answer.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.221
Oh, boy.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.956
Rick, why don't you
show Nick
where Erica's room is?

12:03.023 --> 12:05.225
She has a keyboard.
It's awesome.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.894
I can play
Axel Foley's theme!

12:06.960 --> 12:08.361
Hah!

12:08.428 --> 12:11.298
Hey, no running, boys.

12:11.364 --> 12:14.968
You do realize that
you're replacing our children
with grown men?

12:15.035 --> 12:17.337
Stop.
They're simply sleeping
in their rooms,

12:17.404 --> 12:19.372
wearing their clothes,
and playing with their toys.

12:19.439 --> 12:24.711
Now, if ya don't mind,
I need to get some prunes
into our son's gym coach.

12:24.778 --> 12:25.979
ADAM:
Even though my dad failed

12:26.046 --> 12:27.480
at getting rid
of his unwanted guests,

12:27.547 --> 12:29.682
Erica had a plan
to get rid of hers.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.884
What the hell?
Bup-bup!

12:30.951 --> 12:32.786
Ninety-eight,
ninety-nine...

12:32.853 --> 12:35.355
First of all...

12:35.422 --> 12:37.190
Second of all, I hope
you'll enjoy brushing

12:37.257 --> 12:38.558
her greasy mane
in the common room

12:38.625 --> 12:40.127
because that's where you
both will be tonight.

12:40.193 --> 12:43.563
I don't think so.
Your brother is now
my out-of-town guest,

12:43.630 --> 12:45.132
and he's not
going anywhere.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.268
Oh, well, that's a shame
because I called in
a new out-of-town guest.

12:48.335 --> 12:49.502
Barry?
Lainey-love!

12:49.569 --> 12:50.838
Who is she?
Who are you?

12:50.904 --> 12:52.539
Lainey, my sucky roommate.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.441
Sucky roommate,
this is my best friend,

12:54.507 --> 12:56.009
who is also the love
of Barry's life.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.677
Was.
Seems like he moved on.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.212
Babe,
she means nothing to me.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.481
Hey, when I say "nothing,"
I meant everything.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.549
Don't even!

13:02.615 --> 13:03.884
My sister was right
about you!

13:03.951 --> 13:05.919
Hey, sis,
got you a sweet comb.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.855
Don't try to make nice
with me, traitor.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.589
Lainey's my new
out-of-town guest,

13:09.656 --> 13:11.324
which means both of you,
beat it.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.526
So, I just sat
on a stinky bus
for six hours

13:13.593 --> 13:15.728
to be used like some
pawn in your battle
with your roommate,

13:15.795 --> 13:17.764
who's now apparently
your brother's new girlfriend?

13:17.831 --> 13:20.300
And it's fun
to get together.

13:26.639 --> 13:30.110
* I just want to
use your love tonight

13:31.644 --> 13:32.712
* Whoa...

13:32.779 --> 13:34.948
No

13:35.015 --> 13:37.184
You

13:37.250 --> 13:39.486
You? Last chance.
Okay.

13:42.255 --> 13:46.026
Dad! I got your message
and rode Dave Kim's sister's
bike the whole way here.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.194
What's the emergency?

13:47.260 --> 13:48.395
Go snuggle your mother.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.496
I thought this was serious.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.899
It is!
Your mom's in a bad place,

13:51.965 --> 13:53.733
and the only thing that'll
snap her out of it

13:53.800 --> 13:55.568
is her delicious little
snuggle monster.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.938
What?
You'll always be
your mother's baby.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.406
Now go let her
smell your head.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.211
* My brother's...
Damn it.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.079
* My name is Nick... *

14:06.146 --> 14:08.248
Hey, I'm not ready
to share this yet.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.417
Dad...

14:10.483 --> 14:12.052
Your mom's going through
some stuff.

14:12.119 --> 14:14.254
What do we do?
You know what to do.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.588
Ugh.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.425
Mama! I need you!

14:18.491 --> 14:20.260
Schmoopie! You're home!

14:20.327 --> 14:23.530
I came home
'cause I missed you.

14:23.596 --> 14:26.399
And I got scawwed.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.002
Uh, will you
give me sniffies on my head?

14:29.069 --> 14:31.371
I am gonna sniff the
out of your head!

14:31.438 --> 14:34.241
Mama G! Good news,
my tummy's feeling way better.
I made real good.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.076
That is fantastic!

14:36.143 --> 14:38.311
Oh, my God,
what have I done?

14:39.746 --> 14:43.116
Can you guys pipe down a bit?
I'm working on my music!

14:43.183 --> 14:45.752
What have I done?

14:48.055 --> 14:49.957
Did I say
you could use that?

14:50.023 --> 14:53.326
Sorry. Just preparing
a little something
for my out-of-town guest.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.495
He may be peckish
from his travels.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.597
Geoff?
Ah! There's my
guest now!

14:57.664 --> 15:00.800
Come, join me in the kitchen
for some heated water.

15:00.867 --> 15:03.136
They're being real uppity
about sharing actual food.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.305
You misplayed this one,
douche lord!

15:05.372 --> 15:07.340
Geoff will clearly be
my out-of-town guest,

15:07.407 --> 15:09.042
which means all of you
need to get out!

15:09.109 --> 15:11.611
No! You had your chance
to make me your
out-of-town guest,

15:11.678 --> 15:13.280
but you chose Barry.
And then Lainey.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.414
Hey, Lainey.
How you been?

15:14.481 --> 15:15.815
Not great. You?
Pretty good.

15:15.882 --> 15:18.518
Well, then, since Geoff
remains my out-of-town guest,

15:18.585 --> 15:20.453
all you ladies must leave...

15:20.520 --> 15:22.322
Unless Lainey wants to stay.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.656
I don't.
What about Erica?

15:23.723 --> 15:25.025
Nope.
Then it's settled!

15:25.092 --> 15:27.660
Me and Geoff will stay in
this room that's not ours.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.462
Have a taste
of the chef's special.

15:29.529 --> 15:30.630
The secret's the heat.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.399
No! I don't want to be
your guest either!

15:32.465 --> 15:34.701
You only asked me here
to piss off your sister
for inviting your ex.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.336
Fine!
If you won't take my side,

15:36.403 --> 15:37.670
then I'll call in
someone who will!

15:37.737 --> 15:39.506
ALL: JT... P?

15:40.740 --> 15:43.710
Uh, Barr?
We just drove three hours.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.146
You said there was a sick
college rager going on.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.480
Did I say "rager"?

15:47.547 --> 15:49.983
Pretty sure I said "angry
standoff in a dorm room."

15:50.050 --> 15:52.219
Dude, I missed my nana's
birthday for this.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.653
Yeah, man.
This is the worst thing

15:53.720 --> 15:55.188
you and Geoff have ever done.
What?

15:55.255 --> 15:57.024
I told him it was your idea.
You get it.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.726
Also seems like
a good time to say
I still have feelings for you.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.894
It may be the worst time.
Okay, Lainey's not on board.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.596
What's he talking about?

16:03.663 --> 16:06.799
He's talking about
overriding the scrunchie rule,
which is what I'm gonna do.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.268
**

16:08.335 --> 16:09.602
What the hell?

16:09.669 --> 16:11.571
I was promised Neil Peart
from Rush would be here.

16:11.638 --> 16:12.872
Oh, look, there's Barry
from school.

16:12.939 --> 16:15.642
Hi, it's Carla.
That's Carla from school.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.510
Enough. I'm telling
the RA you're the
worst roommate

16:17.577 --> 16:19.112
on the planet
and you gotta go.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.514
Not if I tell him
that you're worser
and you gotta go!

16:21.581 --> 16:23.550
**

16:23.616 --> 16:24.951
Srini, open up!

16:25.018 --> 16:27.120
My roommate's a monster
who refuses to cap
the toothpaste!

16:27.187 --> 16:30.023
She ate my Shark Bites!
The world is her pantry!

16:30.090 --> 16:31.658
So, if anyone's out,
it's her.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.126
Actually, you're both out.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.894
Geoff,
don't you scrunchie that door!

16:34.961 --> 16:36.763
I'm sorry, but you guys
have been best friends
all year

16:36.829 --> 16:38.231
and all of the out-of-town
guests agree

16:38.298 --> 16:39.832
that you need to grow up
and work it out.

16:39.899 --> 16:42.535
Best friends? She's just
some random girl

16:42.602 --> 16:44.271
picked from a hat
to live with me.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.572
It's madness.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.840
Strangers shouldn't be forced
to sleep four feet apart!

16:47.907 --> 16:49.976
**

16:52.812 --> 16:56.716
Wow.
That's all I am to you,
some random stranger?

16:56.783 --> 16:58.585
That's not what I meant.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.920
No, I get it.

17:00.987 --> 17:02.089
You win.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.456
Take the stupid room.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.526
**

17:09.596 --> 17:12.332
ADAM: Realizing
she had swapped out
her kids with coaches,

17:12.399 --> 17:14.801
my mom knew it
was time to call the game.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.138
Hot damn! Smells like Mama G's
cookin' up a storm in here!

17:18.205 --> 17:21.341
Well, I figured it would
be nice to send you off
with full bellies.

17:21.408 --> 17:22.975
Send us off?
Did we do something wrong?

17:23.042 --> 17:25.812
It's my fault, huh?
I ate all your apples.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.880
No, you've both been
very well-behaved

17:27.947 --> 17:31.818
large and double-extra-large
house guests.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.321
It's just that,
at some point,

17:34.387 --> 17:35.955
it's time to leave
the nest.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.990
It's so cruel and lonely
out there.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.492
And you have pillows here.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.295
My big brave boys
are ready to go.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.564
I mean, look at you, Rick,
with your...

17:46.099 --> 17:49.502
...being clean now
and, uh, Nick with your...

17:50.970 --> 17:52.172
...music.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.506
You think?
I know!

17:53.573 --> 17:55.608
Now spread your wings
and fly!

17:55.675 --> 17:58.645
Look out, world!
Here come the Mellor boys!

17:58.711 --> 18:00.447
Now grab your snackies.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.449
Oh, um, actually, you know,
neither one of us drove...

18:02.515 --> 18:05.285
She said fly!

18:05.352 --> 18:07.287
So much for the Bevolution.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.088
It's the first weekend ever
without our kids,

18:09.156 --> 18:11.090
and I completely
lost my mind.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.560
Well, we still have a few more
years to ease into it.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.695
And what am I gonna do
when they all leave for good?

18:15.762 --> 18:18.998
Honestly, it's gonna be awful
for the both of us.

18:19.065 --> 18:21.168
Please.
For the last four years,

18:21.234 --> 18:24.003
all you've talked about is
how you want them all to leave

18:24.070 --> 18:26.239
so you can have
some peace and quiet.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.775
Bevy,
you know I hate change,

18:28.841 --> 18:31.144
but it's easier for me
to say, "I want them out"

18:31.211 --> 18:35.548
than to admit I love
our crazy, loud family.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.783
You're gonna miss 'em, huh?

18:39.419 --> 18:41.321
Really helps to know
I'm not alone.

18:41.388 --> 18:44.791
* I just wanna use
your love tonight

18:46.025 --> 18:48.161
Oh. Hey.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.730
Welcome to the common room.

18:50.797 --> 18:54.534
It's just for the night.
Housing is getting me a new
roommate this weekend, so...

18:54.601 --> 18:57.570
Okay, this is crazy.
You can't move out.

18:57.637 --> 18:58.871
It's not like we're friends.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.708
I'm just some random girl
that got picked from a hat.

19:01.774 --> 19:05.011
Look, college has been
way harder than I thought,

19:05.077 --> 19:07.079
but you've been the only thing
that's made it easier.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.017
I'm sorry I ate
your Shark Bites.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.452
I'm sorry I stole
your ice tray.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.221
I'm sorry I played
the trumpet
in your face.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.223
I'm sorry that I lured
half my high school up here.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.590
I'm sorry I made up Hector.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.991
What?

19:19.058 --> 19:20.760
He's so not real. I just,
like, needed you to go away.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.995
That is brilliant

19:23.062 --> 19:25.465
and totally something
I would do!

19:25.532 --> 19:28.100
* As you leave me, please,
would you close the door?

19:28.167 --> 19:30.837
Come on.
Let's get our room back
from my out-of-town guests.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.039
No way they're letting us
back in after what we pulled.

19:33.105 --> 19:36.743
Well... I think I have a way
to make it up to them.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.411
* Another shoulder
to cry upon

19:38.478 --> 19:40.913
ALL:
* I just want to use
your love

19:40.980 --> 19:43.015
* Tonight

19:43.716 --> 19:45.552
* Yeah

19:45.618 --> 19:50.122
* I don't want to lose
your love tonight

19:51.258 --> 19:52.859
* Yeah *

19:52.925 --> 19:55.562
Thank God the one thing
I learned at college is
how to throw a good party.

19:55.628 --> 19:58.064
I got to admit, that six-hour
bus ride was almost worth it.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.432
I'm so sorry, Lainey.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.734
It's okay.
It was so good to see you.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.103
And Barry, too, kinda.
I heard that!

20:04.170 --> 20:07.607
She said it was kinda
okay to see me!
Cool.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.742
This is kinda
the greatest night of my life!

20:09.809 --> 20:12.945
ADAM: Turns out,
one little scrunchie that was
meant to keep my sister away

20:13.012 --> 20:14.681
brought everyone together.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.583
As for my parents,
for the first time,

20:16.649 --> 20:18.785
their future alone
didn't seem so scary.

20:18.851 --> 20:21.454
Murray, what's all this?

20:21.521 --> 20:22.955
Adam went back
to Dave Kim's,

20:23.022 --> 20:24.591
so you're stuck
with just me again.

20:24.657 --> 20:27.327
In fact, the future looked
brighter than ever.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.696
You made me dinner.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.831
You said you weren't even
gonna wash the dishes.

20:31.898 --> 20:32.932
People change.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.467
Well, don't go changing
too much.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.503
You don't have to worry.

20:36.569 --> 20:40.840
Sometimes, fate
can bring strangers together
in the most random of ways.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.842
But suddenly, everything
falls into place

20:42.909 --> 20:45.077
and that stranger
becomes family.

20:45.144 --> 20:47.714
But no matter what
the universe has in store,

20:47.780 --> 20:49.682
you can face
even the biggest of changes

20:49.749 --> 20:51.518
when the people
you love most

20:51.584 --> 20:54.253
pull up a chair
and never leave your side.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.727
**

21:00.793 --> 21:02.128
Hi, I'm Rick Mellor.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.999
Just to have your name
mentioned on a TV
like that was kind of crazy.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.302
I didn't believe it
when people first started
telling me about it.

21:09.369 --> 21:10.503
I don't miss a show now.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.971
The worst part
about the whole thing,

21:12.038 --> 21:13.973
my neighbors think I actually
act like that when I teach.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.708
Think you guys are ready
for the apex

21:15.775 --> 21:18.511
of rubber-ball-based sports...
Dodgeball.

21:18.578 --> 21:21.814
Next day at school,
"Mr. Mellor, can we
play dodgeball?"

21:21.881 --> 21:24.451
So we end up start playing
dodgeball again
because of the show.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.386
When you're a phys-ed teacher,
you do stuff like that.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.355
You have fun with the kids.
You do stuff with the kids.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.790
The kids accuse me
of breaking their ankles.
I never did that.
