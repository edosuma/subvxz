01:12.113 --> 01:13.428
First, my contours.

01:17.036 --> 01:18.197
The outline.

01:26.281 --> 01:27.432
Not too fast.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.671
Take time to look at me.

01:44.364 --> 01:46.183
See how my arms are placed.

01:49.286 --> 01:50.211
My hands.

02:00.413 --> 02:01.783
Who brought that painting out?

02:11.406 --> 02:13.272
From the stock.
I shouldn't have?

02:13.764 --> 02:14.518
No.

02:19.753 --> 02:20.861
Did you paint it?

02:24.244 --> 02:24.847
Yes.

02:30.629 --> 02:31.637
A long time ago.

02:36.249 --> 02:37.321
What's the title?

02:41.209 --> 02:42.934
<i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire.</i>

04:53.234 --> 04:54.536
Where do I go?

04:56.802 --> 04:58.579
Head straight up to the trees.

05:50.875 --> 05:51.955
I'm Marianne.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.447
It was a reception room.

07:04.022 --> 07:05.455
I've never seen it used.

07:07.082 --> 07:08.725
Have you been here long?

07:08.892 --> 07:09.955
Three years.

07:14.171 --> 07:15.494
Do you like it here?

07:16.091 --> 07:16.975
Yes.

07:22.696 --> 07:24.037
I'll let you get dry.

10:18.213 --> 10:19.460
Sorry, I helped myself.

10:20.439 --> 10:21.381
I was hungry.

10:24.548 --> 10:25.651
Is there any wine?

10:26.060 --> 10:26.894
Yes.

10:46.646 --> 10:47.955
May I be curious?

10:58.180 --> 10:59.505
What is your young mistress like?

11:01.522 --> 11:02.935
I don't know her well.

11:05.838 --> 11:07.275
You've been here three years.

11:08.426 --> 11:10.021
She only arrived a few weeks ago.

11:12.306 --> 11:13.513
Where from?

11:15.338 --> 11:16.544
The Benedictines.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.868
Has she left holy orders?

11:22.552 --> 11:23.901
They brought her home.

11:28.329 --> 11:29.639
Her sister died.

11:31.488 --> 11:33.059
She was the only one due to marry?

11:40.314 --> 11:41.631
Did disease take her?

11:44.218 --> 11:45.131
No.

11:50.503 --> 11:51.916
Will you manage it?

11:54.888 --> 11:55.912
Manage what?

11:57.547 --> 11:58.508
To paint her.

11:59.547 --> 12:00.651
Why do you ask?

12:01.611 --> 12:02.952
Another painter was here.

12:05.990 --> 12:07.245
He wasn't able to.

12:08.697 --> 12:09.903
What happened?

12:14.940 --> 12:16.051
I don't know.

14:09.728 --> 14:11.670
I'm afraid it's the only one.

14:18.102 --> 14:21.309
She has no dresses yet
and wears her convent clothes.

14:23.922 --> 14:25.247
She has blond hair?

14:25.438 --> 14:26.089
Yes.

14:31.083 --> 14:32.186
This will do.

14:41.786 --> 14:43.469
Do you recognize it?

14:45.619 --> 14:47.016
My father painted it.

14:50.559 --> 14:51.686
One of his first.

14:52.749 --> 14:55.544
It was in Milan, before my marriage.

15:02.901 --> 15:05.378
My daughter's suitor is Milanese.

15:05.640 --> 15:08.196
We'll go there if he likes the portrait.

15:08.490 --> 15:09.482
You'll leave.

15:10.893 --> 15:12.576
I have to tell you...

15:14.259 --> 15:16.441
She wore out one painter before you.

15:17.357 --> 15:20.857
In a very simple manner:
she refused to pose.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.620
He never saw her face.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.160
Why won't she be painted?

15:26.282 --> 15:27.830
She refuses this marriage.

15:33.124 --> 15:35.386
You must paint her without her knowing.

15:36.912 --> 15:39.968
She thinks you're a companion
for walks.

15:41.111 --> 15:42.318
She's delighted.

15:42.945 --> 15:45.460
Since she arrived, I don't let her out.

15:46.484 --> 15:47.333
Why not?

15:50.445 --> 15:52.651
I wasn't wary enough with her sister.

15:56.683 --> 15:58.516
She thinks I'll watch over her.

15:59.901 --> 16:01.861
And you, observe her.

16:04.073 --> 16:06.668
Is painting her that way feasible?

16:07.058 --> 16:08.978
More than being a companion.

16:12.422 --> 16:14.517
The portrait arrived here before me.

16:18.674 --> 16:21.094
When I first entered this room,

16:21.237 --> 16:24.624
I found myself facing my image
hanging on the wall.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.378
She was waiting for me.

17:59.447 --> 18:00.995
She's waiting to go out.

18:02.062 --> 18:02.998
Come in.

18:06.534 --> 18:09.343
Tell me, what happened to your mistress?

18:10.018 --> 18:11.296
How did she die?

18:14.073 --> 18:15.708
We were walking by the cliffs.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.160
She was behind me and vanished.

18:19.222 --> 18:20.936
I saw her broken body below.

18:23.707 --> 18:25.014
Did you see her fall?

18:25.162 --> 18:26.156
No.

18:26.417 --> 18:27.615
I think she jumped.

18:30.313 --> 18:31.528
Why do you think that?

18:34.977 --> 18:36.160
She didn't cry out.

19:59.897 --> 20:01.564
I've dreamt of that for years.

20:03.889 --> 20:04.929
Dying?

20:06.126 --> 20:07.070
Running.

21:17.169 --> 21:20.788
<i>One must show the ear
and study its cartilage closely,</i>

21:21.566 --> 21:23.661
<i>even if covered with hair.</i>

21:24.728 --> 21:27.856
<i>It must be
of a warm and transparent hue,</i>

21:28.750 --> 21:31.099
<i>except for the hole,
which is always strong.</i>

21:32.544 --> 21:36.264
<i>Its tone, even in light,
must yield to the cheek,</i>

21:37.896 --> 21:39.499
<i>which is more prominent.</i>

21:42.051 --> 21:43.385
Did you bring a book?

21:44.956 --> 21:45.909
Yes.

21:47.394 --> 21:48.696
May I borrow it?

21:50.447 --> 21:51.748
I'll fetch it.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.214
Thank you.

22:35.739 --> 22:37.382
It's odd you sleep here.

24:52.575 --> 24:53.742
Miss...

24:54.679 --> 24:55.766
Miss!

24:58.943 --> 25:00.007
She's waiting.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.663
Is she downstairs?

25:17.663 --> 25:18.790
I must cover you up.

25:19.504 --> 25:20.298
It's windy.

26:51.101 --> 26:52.451
I'd like to bathe.

26:59.938 --> 27:01.343
On a calmer day.

27:01.912 --> 27:02.674
Yes.

27:07.190 --> 27:08.516
How long will you stay?

27:09.361 --> 27:10.346
Six more days.

27:17.350 --> 27:18.477
Do you swim?

27:23.495 --> 27:24.607
I don't know.

27:27.114 --> 27:28.781
It's too dangerous if you don't.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.432
I meant, I don't know if I can swim.

28:29.001 --> 28:30.438
How was your day?

28:32.017 --> 28:33.017
Difficult.

28:38.733 --> 28:40.638
She always stays ahead of me

28:41.503 --> 28:43.487
and walks alone on the beach.

28:46.906 --> 28:48.469
Have you started painting?

28:50.009 --> 28:50.985
Not yet.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.267
I haven't even seen her smile.

28:56.164 --> 28:57.633
Have you tried to be funny?

30:11.666 --> 30:12.992
Is it unfinished?

30:15.856 --> 30:17.166
My sister was embroidering it.

30:19.722 --> 30:21.135
Do you think she wanted to die?

30:25.726 --> 30:28.679
You're the first person
unafraid to ask that.

30:30.208 --> 30:31.502
Apart from you?

30:33.955 --> 30:35.947
Not out loud. But yes.

30:40.918 --> 30:42.926
In her last letter, she apologized.

30:43.307 --> 30:44.434
For no reason.

30:46.579 --> 30:48.088
What could she be apologizing for?

30:52.610 --> 30:54.102
For leaving me her fate.

30:56.101 --> 30:57.879
You make it sound terrible.

31:03.504 --> 31:05.131
What do you know of my marriage?

31:07.931 --> 31:10.343
You're to wed
a Milanese gentleman, that's all.

31:12.216 --> 31:13.701
That's all I know too.

31:14.421 --> 31:15.881
You see why it worries me.

31:19.389 --> 31:20.699
Put that way, yes.

31:22.162 --> 31:23.463
I put it the way it is.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.719
You'd rather have stayed
in the convent?

31:29.871 --> 31:31.578
It's a life that has advantages.

31:32.093 --> 31:33.292
There's a library.

31:33.784 --> 31:35.633
You can sing or hear music.

31:41.148 --> 31:43.268
And equality is a pleasant feeling.

31:47.418 --> 31:49.077
I found the convent unjust.

31:50.129 --> 31:51.952
I left after my fist communion.

31:52.645 --> 31:55.478
They punished me
for drawing in my notebooks' margins.

31:56.353 --> 31:57.258
You draw?

31:58.726 --> 32:00.313
Yes. A little.

32:09.233 --> 32:11.479
What about you?
When will you marry?

32:15.001 --> 32:16.541
I don't know if I will.

32:17.338 --> 32:18.957
- You don't have to?
- No.

32:20.743 --> 32:23.601
I'll take over my father's business.

32:34.051 --> 32:36.813
You can choose.
That's why you don't understand me.

32:41.516 --> 32:42.675
I understand you.

32:46.401 --> 32:48.013
How are your days?

32:49.004 --> 32:51.591
We return late
and I have little light to work.

32:53.827 --> 32:56.279
I'll keep her here tomorrow afternoon.

32:56.628 --> 32:58.858
You'll be free to make progress.

33:00.723 --> 33:03.357
Perhaps you could allow her
to go out alone.

33:05.822 --> 33:08.688
Fear not. She isn't sad, but angry.

33:10.950 --> 33:12.808
You think I don't know her anger?

33:15.189 --> 33:16.220
I know it well.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.702
Yes, I know it too.

33:22.265 --> 33:23.749
Where did you learn Italian?

33:24.600 --> 33:25.394
In Milan.

33:26.448 --> 33:27.750
You know Milan?

33:28.456 --> 33:30.075
I can't wait to go back.

33:30.766 --> 33:33.012
I haven't gone back in 20 years.

33:33.905 --> 33:35.841
Tell her Milan is beautiful.

33:36.492 --> 33:38.040
And that life will be sweeter.

33:39.403 --> 33:40.720
She doesn't talk much to me.

33:42.485 --> 33:44.882
I'm not marrying her
to the local gentry.

33:45.565 --> 33:46.929
I'm trying

33:47.437 --> 33:48.950
to take her elsewhere.

33:49.625 --> 33:51.625
She'll be less bored there.

33:52.478 --> 33:53.684
And you too.

33:54.048 --> 33:55.115
Indeed. Why not?

33:59.075 --> 34:01.749
I'll leave for the coast
at the same time as you.

34:02.755 --> 34:04.969
If you don't have to return to Paris,

34:05.969 --> 34:08.533
I have a friend
who'd like her portrait done.

34:10.414 --> 34:11.129
Thank you.

34:12.295 --> 34:13.541
It won't be easy.

34:14.946 --> 34:17.636
My friend is particularly ugly.

34:20.725 --> 34:21.931
She's very ugly.

34:30.301 --> 34:31.650
You've made me laugh.

34:33.833 --> 34:35.579
It's ages since that happened.

34:37.031 --> 34:38.301
I didn't do anything.

34:39.592 --> 34:40.454
You're here.

34:41.628 --> 34:43.447
It takes two to be funny.

35:35.315 --> 35:36.387
Marianne?

36:21.882 --> 36:22.985
Do you have tobacco?

36:24.572 --> 36:25.334
Yes.

36:52.671 --> 36:54.766
Your mother will let you
go out alone tomorrow.

36:56.561 --> 36:57.552
You'll be free.

37:00.743 --> 37:02.180
Being free is being alone?

37:04.612 --> 37:05.652
You don't think so?

37:06.596 --> 37:07.763
I'll tell you tomorrow.

37:14.587 --> 37:15.826
I'll go to mass.

37:17.245 --> 37:18.616
To receive Communion?

37:19.422 --> 37:20.755
I want to hear music.

37:22.206 --> 37:24.118
Organ music is pretty but bleak.

37:24.793 --> 37:25.976
It's all I know.

37:27.272 --> 37:28.844
You've never heard an orchestra?

37:29.242 --> 37:29.925
No.

37:31.598 --> 37:32.447
Have you?

37:37.272 --> 37:38.312
Tell me about it.

37:43.792 --> 37:45.569
It's not easy to relate music.

38:35.447 --> 38:36.368
What is it?

38:37.731 --> 38:38.906
A piece that I love.

38:44.844 --> 38:45.980
Is it merry?

38:47.916 --> 38:49.980
Not merry, but it's lively.

39:05.797 --> 39:07.606
It's about a coming storm.

39:13.428 --> 39:14.745
The insects sense it.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.012
They become agitated.

39:21.424 --> 39:22.854
Then the storm breaks.

39:25.285 --> 39:26.920
With lightning and the wind.

39:38.246 --> 39:39.738
I can't remember it...

39:46.364 --> 39:49.110
You'll hear the rest.
Milan is a city of music.

39:53.943 --> 39:55.331
Then I can't wait for Milan.

40:00.301 --> 40:02.214
I'm saying there will be good things.

40:06.473 --> 40:08.521
You're saying that, now and then,

40:09.957 --> 40:11.370
I'll be consoled.

41:57.780 --> 41:59.408
How was mass?

42:02.262 --> 42:03.731
You look cheerful.

42:03.929 --> 42:05.207
I sang a lot.

42:06.605 --> 42:08.026
Are you leaving me already?

42:08.406 --> 42:09.525
Yes.

42:09.843 --> 42:11.446
Will you come out tomorrow?

42:13.454 --> 42:14.644
Yes.

42:16.419 --> 42:18.959
In solitude,
I felt the liberty you spoke of.

42:23.230 --> 42:25.262
But I also felt your absence.

43:00.302 --> 43:01.548
The portrait is finished.

43:04.392 --> 43:05.701
Are you happy with it?

43:07.802 --> 43:09.088
I think so.

43:11.319 --> 43:12.723
Let's go to see it.

43:20.655 --> 43:22.195
May I ask a favour?

43:26.409 --> 43:27.259
Go on.

43:31.681 --> 43:33.430
I'd like to show her first.

43:35.512 --> 43:37.062
And tell her the truth myself.

43:41.529 --> 43:42.521
I understand.

43:44.060 --> 43:45.251
She's very fond of you.

43:48.828 --> 43:49.836
How do you know?

43:54.469 --> 43:56.199
She talks about you.

45:52.675 --> 45:53.429
Héloïse...

45:56.469 --> 45:57.874
I must tell you something.

46:00.676 --> 46:01.795
I'm a painter.

46:02.931 --> 46:04.193
I came here to paint you.

46:08.286 --> 46:09.936
I've finished your portrait.

46:19.314 --> 46:21.822
I see now why you praised
the charms of exile.

46:23.595 --> 46:24.873
You felt guilty.

46:35.922 --> 46:37.231
Are you leaving?

46:38.195 --> 46:40.290
Later today. With your mother.

46:50.267 --> 46:51.799
Then I shall bathe today.

48:14.448 --> 48:16.218
Well, can you swim?

48:17.338 --> 48:18.859
I still don't know if I can.

48:20.201 --> 48:21.201
Did you see me?

48:22.431 --> 48:23.740
You can float.

48:33.645 --> 48:34.867
Let's go back.

48:44.867 --> 48:46.184
It explains all your looks.

49:13.575 --> 49:14.781
You're saying nothing?

49:19.933 --> 49:20.885
Is that me?

49:23.620 --> 49:24.350
Yes.

49:27.406 --> 49:28.715
Is that how you see me?

49:34.293 --> 49:35.706
It's not only me.

49:37.597 --> 49:39.112
What do you mean, not only you?

49:42.184 --> 49:45.264
There are rules, conventions, ideas.

49:50.329 --> 49:51.860
You mean there's no life?

49:53.320 --> 49:54.372
No presence?

49:55.955 --> 49:59.971
Your presence is made up
of fleeting moments that may lack truth.

50:02.539 --> 50:03.873
Not everything is fleeting.

50:07.017 --> 50:08.620
Some feelings are deep.

50:13.199 --> 50:14.810
The fact it isn't close to me,

50:16.067 --> 50:17.369
that I can understand.

50:20.565 --> 50:23.216
But I find it sad
it isn't close to you.

50:24.160 --> 50:26.891
How do you know
it isn't close to me?

50:28.985 --> 50:30.802
I didn't know you were an art critic.

50:32.183 --> 50:33.611
I didn't know you were a painter.

50:40.523 --> 50:41.888
I'll fetch my mother.

51:26.259 --> 51:28.608
It wasn't good enough. I'll start again.

51:31.126 --> 51:32.228
You're joking.

51:34.892 --> 51:35.813
I'm sorry.

51:37.217 --> 51:38.518
It wasn't satisfactory.

51:39.182 --> 51:40.579
You're incompetent then.

51:41.136 --> 51:42.239
You can leave.

51:43.528 --> 51:44.624
She's staying.

51:47.497 --> 51:48.814
I'll pose for her.

51:50.867 --> 51:51.700
Really?

51:53.771 --> 51:54.573
Yes.

52:04.479 --> 52:05.264
Why?

52:09.823 --> 52:11.133
What does it change for you?

52:16.200 --> 52:17.144
Nothing.

52:21.957 --> 52:23.385
I'll be away five days.

52:23.949 --> 52:25.894
When I return, it will be finished.

52:27.453 --> 52:28.890
And I decide, not you.

52:30.477 --> 52:31.398
Understood?

52:37.701 --> 52:39.764
Say goodbye like when you were little.

53:15.202 --> 53:16.503
Sit down.

53:27.933 --> 53:29.513
Turn your chest towards me.

53:32.109 --> 53:33.164
A little more.

53:37.228 --> 53:38.577
Turn your head slightly.

53:52.041 --> 53:53.239
Rest your arm here.

53:55.280 --> 53:57.137
Not like that. May I?

54:00.230 --> 54:01.635
Take your hand.

54:02.829 --> 54:03.956
The other way.

54:05.196 --> 54:05.967
Like this.

54:16.860 --> 54:18.559
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

54:19.424 --> 54:21.178
Can you hold this position?

54:21.391 --> 54:22.264
Yes.

54:29.104 --> 54:30.254
Look at me.

55:45.521 --> 55:47.013
The heat will do you good.

55:48.012 --> 55:49.417
The cherrystones hold it in.

56:03.685 --> 56:04.733
Thank you.

56:10.726 --> 56:12.551
I usually have one ready,

56:13.279 --> 56:14.716
but I haven't had my monthlies.

56:18.788 --> 56:20.018
More than once?

56:20.906 --> 56:22.097
Three times.

56:25.915 --> 56:27.494
Is this the first time?

56:27.796 --> 56:28.510
Yes.

56:31.665 --> 56:33.162
Do you want a child?

56:33.354 --> 56:34.227
No.

56:35.127 --> 56:38.266
I was waiting for Madam to leave
to see to it.

57:02.324 --> 57:03.136
I can't.

57:03.293 --> 57:04.322
A little more.

57:23.850 --> 57:24.896
I can't go on.

58:04.074 --> 58:04.875
No.

58:06.316 --> 58:07.933
It mustn't be in flower.

58:37.030 --> 58:38.054
It's ready.

59:03.760 --> 59:05.167
Will it be enough?

59:05.333 --> 59:06.408
We'll see.

59:32.373 --> 59:33.818
Has it happened to you?

59:39.087 --> 59:40.055
Yes.

59:43.077 --> 59:44.455
You've known love.

59:48.013 --> 59:48.728
Yes.

59:51.627 --> 59:52.518
What is it like?

59:55.466 --> 59:56.933
It's hard to say.

59:58.561 --> 01:00:00.140
I mean, how does it feel?

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:45.935
I can't make you smile.

01:03:48.002 --> 01:03:50.597
I feel I do it
and then it vanishes.

01:03:54.693 --> 01:03:56.201
Anger always comes to the fore.

01:03:57.074 --> 01:03:58.379
Definitely with you.

01:04:03.597 --> 01:04:04.923
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:04:06.393 --> 01:04:07.510
You haven't hurt me.

01:04:08.093 --> 01:04:09.320
I have, I can tell.

01:04:09.637 --> 01:04:12.002
When you're moved,
you do this with your hand.

01:04:13.862 --> 01:04:14.714
Really?

01:04:15.104 --> 01:04:15.737
Yes.

01:04:19.537 --> 01:04:21.304
And when you're embarrassed,

01:04:23.307 --> 01:04:24.557
you bite your lips.

01:04:29.195 --> 01:04:30.899
And when you're annoyed,

01:04:33.413 --> 01:04:34.569
you don't blink.

01:04:35.467 --> 01:04:36.475
You know it all.

01:04:38.194 --> 01:04:40.318
Forgive me,
I'd hate to be in your place.

01:04:42.882 --> 01:04:44.390
We're in the same place.

01:04:45.453 --> 01:04:46.710
Exactly the same place.

01:04:49.112 --> 01:04:50.026
Come here.

01:04:52.667 --> 01:04:53.307
Come.

01:05:02.736 --> 01:05:03.611
Step closer.

01:05:10.859 --> 01:05:11.596
Look.

01:05:15.118 --> 01:05:16.321
If you look at me,

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:18.422
who do I look at?

01:05:23.481 --> 01:05:26.232
When you don't know what to say,
you touch your forehead.

01:05:31.275 --> 01:05:33.796
When you lose control,
you raise your eyebrows.

01:05:41.541 --> 01:05:42.822
And when you're troubled,

01:05:44.322 --> 01:05:45.604
you breathe through your mouth.

01:06:40.987 --> 01:06:43.582
- I didn't touch!
- I win.

01:06:43.739 --> 01:06:44.966
I win.

01:06:45.339 --> 01:06:46.330
You touched it.

01:06:46.712 --> 01:06:48.190
Try to concentrate.

01:06:50.916 --> 01:06:52.115
Your turn.

01:06:58.001 --> 01:06:59.045
You're cheating.

01:06:59.236 --> 01:07:01.346
I'm not cheating, I play fast.

01:07:04.941 --> 01:07:05.947
Go on.

01:07:06.138 --> 01:07:06.885
Two.

01:07:07.753 --> 01:07:09.160
- Two cards.
- Two.

01:07:09.357 --> 01:07:10.418
Two sixes.

01:07:11.037 --> 01:07:12.818
- I win.
- You win, yes.

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:20.482
Your turn.

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:22.537
No, go on.

01:07:23.488 --> 01:07:24.355
Go on.

01:07:43.728 --> 01:07:45.220
Uncover your throat.

01:07:52.044 --> 01:07:53.002
More.

01:07:59.784 --> 01:08:02.201
You have my future husband in mind.

01:08:09.842 --> 01:08:11.704
Do you paint nude models too?

01:08:13.391 --> 01:08:15.001
Women, yes.

01:08:15.388 --> 01:08:16.993
Why not men?

01:08:19.051 --> 01:08:20.514
I'm not allowed to.

01:08:21.314 --> 01:08:22.090
Why not?

01:08:23.764 --> 01:08:25.455
Because I'm a woman.

01:08:30.538 --> 01:08:32.225
Is it a matter of modesty?

01:08:35.457 --> 01:08:38.577
It's mostly to prevent us
from doing great art.

01:08:41.127 --> 01:08:45.381
Without any notion of male anatomy,
the major subjects escape us.

01:08:45.899 --> 01:08:46.819
How do you manage?

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:49.483
I do it in secret.

01:08:50.549 --> 01:08:51.651
It's tolerated.

01:08:56.804 --> 01:08:58.359
What do you tell your models

01:08:59.185 --> 01:09:00.296
to amuse them?

01:09:02.009 --> 01:09:03.680
- Are you bored?
- No.

01:09:04.321 --> 01:09:05.609
I'm interested in you.

01:09:11.068 --> 01:09:13.227
Your complexion is remarkable today.

01:09:18.671 --> 01:09:20.232
You're very elegant.

01:09:26.779 --> 01:09:28.100
You pose beautifully.

01:09:34.234 --> 01:09:35.327
You're pretty.

01:09:43.776 --> 01:09:45.118
That's what I tell them.

01:10:55.123 --> 01:10:59.297
<i>Then, striking the lyre
to accompany his words, he sang,</i>

01:10:59.652 --> 01:11:01.497
<i>'Oh, Gods of the Underworld</i>

01:11:01.676 --> 01:11:04.415
<i>to which all mortals descend,</i>

01:11:04.956 --> 01:11:07.170
<i>I am here to seek my wife.</i>

01:11:07.546 --> 01:11:10.091
<i>A viper that she trod on</i>

01:11:10.258 --> 01:11:13.084
<i>poisoned her
and robbed her of her youth.</i>

01:11:13.655 --> 01:11:14.979
<i>I beseech you,</i>

01:11:15.324 --> 01:11:18.908
<i>unravel the thread
of Eurydice's early demise.</i>

01:11:19.436 --> 01:11:20.942
<i>All will be yours.</i>

01:11:21.447 --> 01:11:23.296
<i>We all end up here.</i>

01:11:23.523 --> 01:11:25.673
<i>This is our final abode.</i>

01:11:25.839 --> 01:11:27.999
<i>You reign over the human race.</i>

01:11:29.056 --> 01:11:33.267
<i>After living out her fair span of years,</i>

01:11:33.533 --> 01:11:34.859
<i>she will be yours.</i>

01:11:35.807 --> 01:11:38.482
<i>If the fates refuse my wife this favour,</i>

01:11:38.674 --> 01:11:41.191
<i>I am determined not to return.</i>

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.412
<i>You may delight in both our deaths'.</i>

01:11:44.707 --> 01:11:46.464
- He's convincing.
- Very.

01:11:46.666 --> 01:11:48.351
I hope they say yes.

01:11:53.582 --> 01:11:55.907
<i>Then, for the first time,</i>

01:11:56.057 --> 01:11:59.156
<i>tears wet the cheeks of the Eumenides,</i>

01:11:59.157 --> 01:12:00.619
<i>won over by his words.</i>

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:02.187
<i>Neither the king's bride,</i>

01:12:02.281 --> 01:12:05.709
<i>nor the ruler of Hades
could resist his prayer.</i>

01:12:06.176 --> 01:12:07.669
<i>They sent for Eurydice.</i>

01:12:07.973 --> 01:12:10.910
<i>She was there, among the recent spirits,</i>

01:12:11.216 --> 01:12:13.795
<i>and approached, limping from her wound.</i>

01:12:14.119 --> 01:12:17.232
<i>She was returned to Orpheus on condition</i>

01:12:17.312 --> 01:12:19.947
<i>that he would not look back
until outside</i>

01:12:20.154 --> 01:12:21.915
<i>or the favour would be void.</i>

01:12:23.719 --> 01:12:28.184
<i>In deep silence,
they took a sloping path,</i>

01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:30.566
<i>steep and dark,</i>

01:12:30.773 --> 01:12:32.368
<i>shrouded in thick mist.</i>

01:12:33.028 --> 01:12:35.450
<i>They were nearing the surface,</i>

01:12:35.989 --> 01:12:38.425
<i>approaching the threshold, when...</i>

01:12:38.702 --> 01:12:41.868
<i>fearing losing Eurydice
and impatient to see her,</i>

01:12:42.170 --> 01:12:44.474
<i>her loving spouse turned</i>

01:12:44.662 --> 01:12:47.170
<i>and she was instantly drawn back.</i>

01:12:47.614 --> 01:12:49.840
<i>She reached out for his embrace</i>

01:12:49.841 --> 01:12:51.239
<i>and wished to hold him.</i>

01:12:51.836 --> 01:12:54.693
<i>Her poor hands
clutched only the empty air.</i>

01:12:55.881 --> 01:12:57.524
<i>Dying a second time,</i>

01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.359
<i>she did not complain.</i>

01:13:00.105 --> 01:13:02.597
<i>His sole fault was loving her.</i>

01:13:02.875 --> 01:13:04.026
That's horrible.

01:13:04.775 --> 01:13:06.473
Poor woman. Why did he turn?

01:13:06.951 --> 01:13:09.850
He was told not to but did,
for no reason.

01:13:09.851 --> 01:13:10.952
There are reasons.

01:13:11.081 --> 01:13:12.081
You think so?

01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:13.669
Read it again.

01:13:15.262 --> 01:13:18.328
<i>They were nearing the surface,
approaching the threshold,</i>

01:13:18.329 --> 01:13:22.352
<i>when, fearing losing Eurydice
and impatient to see her,</i>

01:13:22.778 --> 01:13:24.467
<i>her loving spouse turned.</i>

01:13:24.861 --> 01:13:28.319
No, he can't look at her
for fear of losing her.

01:13:28.572 --> 01:13:31.845
That's no reason.
He was told not to do that.

01:13:32.032 --> 01:13:34.408
He's madly in love. He can't resist.

01:13:35.132 --> 01:13:36.807
I think Sophie has a point.

01:13:37.319 --> 01:13:39.747
He could resist.
His reasons aren't serious.

01:13:40.323 --> 01:13:42.021
Perhaps he makes a choice.

01:13:42.378 --> 01:13:43.464
What choice?

01:13:44.065 --> 01:13:48.260
He chooses the memory of her.
That's why he turns.

01:13:50.886 --> 01:13:53.711
He doesn't make the lover's choice,
but the poet's.

01:14:00.752 --> 01:14:03.133
<i>She spoke a last farewell</i>

01:14:03.673 --> 01:14:06.062
<i>that scarcely reached his ears</i>

01:14:06.366 --> 01:14:08.413
<i>and fell back into the abyss.</i>

01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:18.916
Perhaps she was the one
who said,

01:14:20.166 --> 01:14:21.280
<i>Turn around.</i>

01:15:51.347 --> 01:15:55.077
She says I'm still pregnant
and to come back in two days.

01:15:55.916 --> 01:15:57.225
I'll come with you.

01:21:14.508 --> 01:21:15.659
What about Héloïse?

01:21:16.554 --> 01:21:18.762
She isn't well. She doesn't want dinner.

01:23:11.971 --> 01:23:14.359
I thought you had been scared off.

01:23:16.789 --> 01:23:18.099
You were right.

01:23:19.591 --> 01:23:20.788
I am scared.

01:23:39.419 --> 01:23:42.954
Do all lovers feel
they're inventing something?

01:23:48.004 --> 01:23:49.409
I know the gestures.

01:23:51.875 --> 01:23:54.248
I imagined it all, waiting for you.

01:23:55.081 --> 01:23:56.323
You dreamt of me?

01:23:58.351 --> 01:23:59.311
No.

01:24:00.462 --> 01:24:01.763
I thought of you.

01:24:41.082 --> 01:24:42.891
You don't want to come anymore?

01:24:45.738 --> 01:24:46.738
I'm coming.

01:24:52.221 --> 01:24:53.393
Get up.

01:25:37.521 --> 01:25:38.604
Wait.

01:25:58.805 --> 01:25:59.940
That's good.

01:26:10.924 --> 01:26:11.952
Lie down.

01:26:15.809 --> 01:26:17.142
Lift your legs.

01:26:18.758 --> 01:26:19.568
There.

01:26:25.386 --> 01:26:26.481
Thank you.

01:26:34.804 --> 01:26:36.271
Deep breaths.

01:26:51.388 --> 01:26:52.388
Look.

01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:45.035
Go to bed.

01:27:46.908 --> 01:27:48.043
I'll watch over her.

01:27:50.708 --> 01:27:52.188
I don't want to go to bed.

01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:57.135
Sophie?

01:27:58.318 --> 01:27:59.524
Are you asleep?

01:28:00.707 --> 01:28:01.804
No.

01:28:03.304 --> 01:28:04.704
Can you get up?

01:28:10.783 --> 01:28:11.804
Help her.

01:28:42.521 --> 01:28:43.821
Get your things.

01:28:44.464 --> 01:28:45.786
We're going to paint.

01:28:49.019 --> 01:28:49.995
Sophie...

01:28:50.464 --> 01:28:51.555
Come here.

01:28:52.381 --> 01:28:53.303
Sit down.

01:28:55.053 --> 01:28:56.186
Come closer.

01:28:58.955 --> 01:29:00.054
Lie down.

01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:19.322
Look at her.

01:29:21.658 --> 01:29:23.500
Arch your back a little.

01:29:28.251 --> 01:29:29.296
Sophie...

01:29:29.852 --> 01:29:31.170
Straighten your head.

01:29:34.710 --> 01:29:35.519
Yes.

01:30:37.358 --> 01:30:38.388
Stop that.

01:30:38.847 --> 01:30:39.688
What?

01:30:43.138 --> 01:30:44.466
What you're doing.

01:30:52.176 --> 01:30:53.270
Be serious.

01:31:04.082 --> 01:31:05.254
Keep still.

01:31:48.544 --> 01:31:50.751
I bought it from a woman at the feast.

01:31:51.548 --> 01:31:52.853
It's a plant.

01:31:54.964 --> 01:31:56.790
She said it makes you fly.

01:31:59.159 --> 01:32:00.492
Have you ever tried it?

01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:02.460
Never.

01:32:04.539 --> 01:32:05.652
Do you want to?

01:32:06.301 --> 01:32:07.247
Now?

01:32:09.263 --> 01:32:11.396
She said it makes time last longer.

01:33:09.490 --> 01:33:10.680
Your eyes.

01:34:02.251 --> 01:34:03.759
You have to drink.

01:35:18.272 --> 01:35:19.856
This time, I like it.

01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:24.673
Perhaps because I know you better.

01:35:25.745 --> 01:35:27.408
Perhaps I've changed.

01:35:27.551 --> 01:35:28.833
Perhaps.

01:35:37.068 --> 01:35:39.610
You didn't destroy the last one for me.

01:35:41.963 --> 01:35:43.395
You did it for you.

01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:48.998
I'd like to destroy this one too.

01:35:50.744 --> 01:35:51.490
Why?

01:36:01.754 --> 01:36:03.738
Through it, I give you to another.

01:36:19.518 --> 01:36:20.955
It's terrible.

01:36:22.963 --> 01:36:25.351
Now you possess me a little,
you bear me a grudge.

01:36:26.677 --> 01:36:28.252
- I don't.
- You do.

01:36:29.612 --> 01:36:31.203
You know you do.

01:36:35.446 --> 01:36:37.113
You're not on my side now.

01:36:37.382 --> 01:36:40.347
You blame me for what comes next.
My marriage.

01:36:40.883 --> 01:36:42.283
You don't support me.

01:36:43.855 --> 01:36:45.224
You're right.

01:36:51.399 --> 01:36:52.799
Go on.

01:36:54.057 --> 01:36:55.900
Say what burdens your heart.

01:37:03.653 --> 01:37:05.733
I believed you braver.

01:37:05.789 --> 01:37:07.883
I believed you braver too.

01:37:10.634 --> 01:37:12.039
That's it then.

01:37:13.230 --> 01:37:14.630
You find me docile.

01:37:15.849 --> 01:37:17.017
Worse...

01:37:18.411 --> 01:37:20.244
You imagine I'm collusive.

01:37:22.419 --> 01:37:23.843
You imagine my pleasure.

01:37:24.527 --> 01:37:26.459
It's a way of avoiding hope.

01:37:28.610 --> 01:37:32.769
Imagine me happy or unhappy
if that reassures you.

01:37:33.983 --> 01:37:36.134
But do not imagine me guilty.

01:37:39.197 --> 01:37:40.979
You'd prefer me to resist.

01:37:45.606 --> 01:37:46.614
Yes.

01:37:47.309 --> 01:37:49.139
Are you asking me to?

01:37:53.095 --> 01:37:54.289
Answer me.

01:37:56.024 --> 01:37:57.016
No.

01:38:31.209 --> 01:38:32.653
Have you seen Héloïse?

01:38:33.137 --> 01:38:35.734
No. She isn't in her room.

01:38:39.192 --> 01:38:40.576
We've had news.

01:38:42.976 --> 01:38:44.521
Madam returns tomorrow.

01:38:45.159 --> 01:38:46.460
Very well.

01:38:46.903 --> 01:38:48.343
Will you be ready?

01:38:50.739 --> 01:38:51.938
Yes.

01:39:20.610 --> 01:39:22.010
Forgive me.

01:39:27.974 --> 01:39:29.379
Forgive me.

01:39:41.654 --> 01:39:43.574
Your mother returns tomorrow.

01:40:47.673 --> 01:40:49.101
Come here.

01:40:49.475 --> 01:40:50.880
With me.

01:41:16.313 --> 01:41:18.328
When do we know it's finished?

01:41:21.522 --> 01:41:23.094
At one point, we stop.

01:42:13.786 --> 01:42:15.164
Finished.

01:42:26.239 --> 01:42:27.539
Who is that for?

01:42:29.768 --> 01:42:31.072
For me.

01:42:37.702 --> 01:42:40.224
You can reproduce that image
to infinity.

01:42:41.686 --> 01:42:42.885
Yes.

01:42:48.549 --> 01:42:50.006
After a while,

01:42:51.351 --> 01:42:52.751
you'll see her

01:42:53.557 --> 01:42:54.910
when you think of me.

01:43:00.635 --> 01:43:02.048
I'll have no image of you.

01:43:06.527 --> 01:43:08.440
Do you want an image of me?

01:43:10.217 --> 01:43:11.298
Yes.

01:43:14.207 --> 01:43:15.302
Which one?

01:43:16.699 --> 01:43:17.905
That one.

01:43:24.601 --> 01:43:25.998
Give me your book.

01:43:29.427 --> 01:43:30.832
Give me a figure.

01:43:31.634 --> 01:43:32.840
28.

01:44:25.635 --> 01:44:27.082
Your eyes are closing.

01:44:33.141 --> 01:44:34.537
Don't go to sleep.

01:44:50.541 --> 01:44:52.072
I feel something new.

01:44:54.912 --> 01:44:56.150
What?

01:44:58.418 --> 01:44:59.818
Regret.

01:45:04.331 --> 01:45:05.754
Don't regret.

01:45:09.116 --> 01:45:10.370
Remember.

01:45:19.368 --> 01:45:22.809
I'll remember when you fell asleep
in the kitchen.

01:45:27.473 --> 01:45:29.189
I'll remember...

01:45:30.983 --> 01:45:32.792
your dark look

01:45:33.236 --> 01:45:35.340
when I beat you at cards.

01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:44.978
I'll remember
the first time you laughed.

01:45:46.597 --> 01:45:48.700
You took your time being funny.

01:45:49.409 --> 01:45:50.740
That's true.

01:45:51.284 --> 01:45:52.775
I wasted time.

01:45:54.562 --> 01:45:56.076
I wasted time too.

01:46:02.122 --> 01:46:05.647
I'll remember
the first time I wanted to kiss you.

01:46:09.427 --> 01:46:10.832
When was that?

01:46:12.384 --> 01:46:13.784
You didn't notice?

01:46:18.324 --> 01:46:20.223
At the feast around the bonfire.

01:46:22.645 --> 01:46:24.045
I wanted to, yes.

01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:26.895
But that wasn't the first time.

01:46:30.029 --> 01:46:31.397
Tell me.

01:46:32.610 --> 01:46:34.256
No, you tell me.

01:46:43.724 --> 01:46:46.057
When you asked if I had known love.

01:46:50.233 --> 01:46:52.423
I could tell the answer was yes.

01:46:53.407 --> 01:46:55.079
And that it was now.

01:47:00.951 --> 01:47:02.439
I remember.

01:47:40.385 --> 01:47:41.577
Good morning.

01:47:41.934 --> 01:47:42.951
Good morning.

01:47:58.423 --> 01:47:59.423
They're here.

01:48:42.824 --> 01:48:44.031
Very good.

01:48:51.552 --> 01:48:52.790
For you.

01:48:54.115 --> 01:48:55.369
Thank you.

01:49:03.573 --> 01:49:04.882
Héloïse...

01:49:05.375 --> 01:49:06.775
Come with me.

01:49:08.468 --> 01:49:09.857
In a minute.

01:49:10.015 --> 01:49:11.503
No, now.

01:49:12.138 --> 01:49:13.749
I have a gift for you.

01:50:03.065 --> 01:50:04.584
I'll say goodbye here.

01:50:14.118 --> 01:50:15.420
Goodbye.

01:50:50.628 --> 01:50:52.128
Have a safe journey.

01:51:17.932 --> 01:51:19.256
Turn around.

01:51:50.685 --> 01:51:52.578
You've made me look so sad.

01:51:57.522 --> 01:51:58.847
You were.

01:52:00.094 --> 01:52:01.418
I'm not anymore.

01:52:11.156 --> 01:52:13.062
<i>I saw her again a first time.</i>

01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:38.539
Are you standing guard?

01:52:39.389 --> 01:52:41.191
I'm observing reactions.

01:52:41.644 --> 01:52:43.044
Do you want mine?

01:52:43.385 --> 01:52:45.068
This Orpheus is excellent.

01:52:45.746 --> 01:52:47.372
Your father is in shape.

01:52:47.577 --> 01:52:50.485
It's my painting.
I submitted it in his name.

01:52:53.606 --> 01:52:56.319
Usually, he's portrayed before he turns

01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:58.951
or after, as Eurydice dies.

01:52:59.610 --> 01:53:02.289
Here, they seem to be saying goodbye.

01:54:11.229 --> 01:54:12.762
<i>I saw her one last time.</i>

01:55:35.790 --> 01:55:37.287
<i>She didn't see me.</i>
