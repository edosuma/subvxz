02:07.503 --> 02:09.377
All boats from Brick.
All boats from Brick.

02:09.545 --> 02:13.341
Make 'em look good. This is the first time
they've seen PT boats.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.279
All boats from Brick.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.907
All boats from Brick. Nice going.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.870
Brick from Rusty.
That ought to show them.

02:58.637 --> 02:59.971
They maneuver beautifully, sir.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.118
-You have a splendid-looking lot of men.
-Thank you, sir.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.828
Gentlemen, we're late.

04:08.332 --> 04:11.167
Those boats of yours maneuver beautifully.

04:12.419 --> 04:15.880
But in wartime, I'm afraid,
I prefer something more substantial.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.313
It's wonderful the way

04:32.481 --> 04:35.024
people believe in those high-powered
canoes of yours.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.778
Don't you believe in them, Rusty?

04:39.529 --> 04:43.366
And I let you sell me that stuff
about a command of my own.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.243
You're skipper of the 34 boat, aren't you?

04:46.578 --> 04:49.914
I used to skipper a cake of soap
in a bathtub, too.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.624

-Oh, thank you.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.831
-Lieutenant.
-Thank you very much, good evening.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.583
Oh, hey, I'd like you to meet a
couple of boat skippers in our squadron.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.545
This is Lieutenant Shorty Long,
Lieutenant Lefty Aiken.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.381
Hey! Excuse me. Hey, what the...

05:59.276 --> 06:00.609
-Hi.
-Hello, Skipper.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.153
I want you to meet Andy Andrews.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.697
He just reported to the squadron.
Shorty Long.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.824
-Happy to know you.
-Thank you.

06:07.284 --> 06:08.868
-Lefty Aiken.
-Howdy.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.911
-Hi.
-Where's Rusty?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.622
Looks like he's doing his paperwork.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.332
Oh.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.384
-Andy.
-Hello, Rusty.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.511
Lefty said you checked in. How you been?

06:27.679 --> 06:29.388
-What will it be?
-Fine. Beer.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.474
Figuring your income tax?

06:31.892 --> 06:35.019
No, I had to work out a smooth line

06:35.187 --> 06:38.272
to convince the admiral
I belong on a destroyer.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.817
So, you're really quitting
the squadron, eh, Rusty, huh?

06:42.444 --> 06:45.362
Can't build a Navy reputation
riding a plywood dream.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.491
What are you aiming at?
Building a reputation?

06:48.992 --> 06:50.618
Or playing for the team?

06:51.495 --> 06:55.081
Look, Brick, for years,
I've been taking your fatherly advice

06:55.248 --> 06:57.124
and it's never been very good.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.251
From here on in, I'm a one-man band.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.754
Okay, send in your request,
I'll forward it.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.175
How about a beer, Rusty?

07:07.010 --> 07:08.969
Five San Miguels.

07:10.806 --> 07:12.264
Nice music.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.600
Gentlemen, I want absolute silence.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.061
Boats here has a little speech to make.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.773
I'm not going to make a speech.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.236
Just got something to say.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.908
Tomorrow, our old pal Doc here
is going out.

08:54.993 --> 08:57.036
He's being paid off after 30 years.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.581
I know most of you kids
got a long ways to go

09:00.749 --> 09:03.709
before you find out
what 30 years in the Navy means.

09:04.669 --> 09:07.463
It means service. Tough and good.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.883
It means serving your country
in peace and in war.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.135

09:21.311 --> 09:23.687

10:29.838 --> 10:31.255
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:31.423 --> 10:33.882
I have a very important
announcement to make.

10:34.551 --> 10:35.801
This is official.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.180
The Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.433
There are no details.

10:43.685 --> 10:47.187
All Army and Navy personnel
must report to their posts immediately.

10:48.315 --> 10:53.569
I repeat, all Army and Navy personnel
must report to their posts immediately.

10:59.743 --> 11:00.868
Let's go, Rusty.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.162

11:04.080 --> 11:05.581

I don't know,
I'm just doing what I'm told.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.732
Any hot dope, Whitey?

12:14.192 --> 12:15.776
Nothing yet, Brick.

12:16.945 --> 12:19.363
OFFICER 1: I suggest...

12:22.033 --> 12:24.535
OFFICER 2: Patrols.
That's probably where they'll attack.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.663
ADMIRAL: Carry on.
OFFICER 2: We'll do our best, sir.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.502
-This just came in, sir.
-Thanks.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.003
Cheers.

12:43.179 --> 12:46.348
Gentlemen, you may assume
that a state of war exists

12:46.516 --> 12:49.518
between the United States
and the Empire of Japan.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.520
Govern yourselves accordingly.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.480
My compliments, gentlemen.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.032
-Here are the orders.
-Yes, sir.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.035
Psst. Psst.

13:08.538 --> 13:09.913
Hey, Hooley.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.548
Yeah?

13:19.716 --> 13:21.425
Got anything for us?

13:21.593 --> 13:23.594
What do you call that outfit again?

13:24.888 --> 13:27.514
Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 3.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.641
We haven't any orders for you now.
But maybe tomorrow.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.144
What do you want us to do?
Sit on our duffs?

13:32.645 --> 13:34.980
I'll ask the old man. Stand by.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.611
(INAUDIBLE)

13:50.121 --> 13:53.415
Have one boat patrol the bay
and one stand by for messenger duty.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.880
RYAN: All boats fueled.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.132
Torpedoes will be loaded
within a half-hour.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.344
-Any dope?
-Our orders are to stand by.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.680
Boy, those destroyers aren't standing by.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.224
They went down that channel
like a rat race.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.060
Somebody might have
given them orders to go.

14:55.937 --> 14:58.230
You got 20 boxes of 50-caliber there.

14:58.815 --> 14:59.940
Give 12 to Lefty.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.149

All boats, out in the bay.

-DOC: Can't be a drill.

That's all we get in this navy,
is drill, drill, drill.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.333
Fire in the paint locker!

16:57.517 --> 17:02.020
One formation. Breaking off.
Heading up our way, sir.

Stand by to disperse.

-Aye, sir.

-Scatter plan Baker.
-Scatter plan Baker. Scatter plan Baker.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.719
-Execute. Execute!
-Execute. Execute!

17:59.787 --> 18:02.164
Good shooting, Smokey. Recognize him?

18:02.331 --> 18:04.332
Know him well. Shaved his father.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.930
Get him, Junior!

All boats from 41.

20:50.499 --> 20:51.791
Let's go, Rusty.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.332
We've checked everything, sir.
The storeroom's completely gone.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.669
No torpedoes, no motors,
no spare parts, no nothing.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.215
(CLATTERING)

21:43.511 --> 21:46.137
Wonder if they have any torpedoes
at Corregidor.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.224
-Might be.
-I'll check on it.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.902
-Hi.
-Hi.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.279
A little rugged, wasn't it?

22:04.323 --> 22:05.532
(CHUCKLING) Yes, sir.

22:07.368 --> 22:08.952
You got wet clothes on
underneath that blanket?

22:09.245 --> 22:12.205
No, sir. Just scared.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.459
You haven't got a monopoly on that.

22:19.588 --> 22:20.922
(LAUGHING)

What are you looking at, Cookie?

22:25.094 --> 22:28.096
Just looking for the Arizona
to come steaming up to base, sir.

With her 14-inch guns blazing
and the best cook stoves in the Navy.

-Arizona, eh?
-Yes, sir.

22:43.696 --> 22:44.988
Arizona.

22:45.781 --> 22:46.990
Arizona, sir?

22:55.291 --> 22:57.208
Some of the Army boys just told us

22:57.418 --> 22:59.210
a big Jap task force
is headed for Lingayen Gulf.

22:59.378 --> 23:02.005
-Army planes spotted it at sunset.
-Must be another landing.

23:02.298 --> 23:03.298
Lingayen?

23:06.302 --> 23:07.635
Give me those scissors, Doc.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.388
That's only about 200 miles from here.

23:12.725 --> 23:13.725
Two thirty-five.

23:14.101 --> 23:15.685
Why don't we knock those babies off?

23:16.020 --> 23:19.022
What with? A cake of soap and a bathtub?
Give me that pencil.

23:29.617 --> 23:31.826
Mr. Brickley, the admiral, sir.
Right away.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.996
Check your gasoline.

23:36.207 --> 23:37.207
Feel better?

23:38.250 --> 23:39.292
Take over.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.379
Line up your engines,
check all boats for sea.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.007
-Step on it, men.
-Fire in the paint locker!

23:55.309 --> 23:57.268
-Yes?
-Brickley.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.354
Mr. Brickley, sir.

24:02.358 --> 24:03.858
You sent for me, sir?

24:04.318 --> 24:06.736
Yes, get a boat ready
to move my staff to Corregidor.

24:07.363 --> 24:08.363
Aye, aye, sir.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.574
You'll run daily messenger trips
between Manila and the Rock.

24:12.535 --> 24:15.036
Work out a schedule
with the Chief of Staff.

24:16.580 --> 24:17.580
Aye, aye, sir.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.875
Cavite is finished as a base.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.629
Move your outfit to Sisiman Cove
on Bataan.

24:28.384 --> 24:29.551
Is that all, sir?

24:30.052 --> 24:31.052
That's all.

24:35.599 --> 24:38.017
Is there any truth in the rumor
that a Jap task force

24:38.227 --> 24:40.061
is moving into Lingayen Gulf, sir?

24:42.273 --> 24:44.607
-Type that and send it.
-Aye, sir.

24:47.361 --> 24:49.529
Sit down, Brickley.

24:55.578 --> 24:57.245
That task force will land.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.747
You and I can't stop it.

25:00.916 --> 25:04.377
Pearl Harbor was a disaster,
like the Spanish Armada.

25:06.380 --> 25:10.175
Listen, son, you and I are professionals.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.553
If the manager says, "Sacrifice,"

25:14.513 --> 25:18.516
we lay down a bunt
and let somebody else hit the home runs.

25:19.435 --> 25:22.103
We know all about those destroyers,
out of commission,

25:22.271 --> 25:23.980
tied up around San Diego.

25:24.940 --> 25:28.651
We could use them here,
but they're not around.

25:29.445 --> 25:34.282
They won't be.
Our job is to lay down that sacrifice.

25:35.951 --> 25:40.246
That's what we were trained for.
And that's what we'll do.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.082
Understand?

25:48.380 --> 25:49.422
Yes, sir.

25:58.140 --> 25:59.140
Thank you.

26:03.187 --> 26:04.520
All set, sir.

26:07.566 --> 26:10.485
-Secure your boats.
-Secure their boats?

26:11.153 --> 26:14.072
Shorty, take the admiral
and his staff to Corregidor.

26:15.157 --> 26:18.826
Lefty, you stand by to run
a messenger trip daily at 9:00.

26:19.787 --> 26:22.580
The rest of you,
take your boats to Sisiman Cove.

26:23.582 --> 26:24.666
You join us there.

26:25.042 --> 26:26.042
Aye, aye, sir.

26:37.513 --> 26:39.013
Are you kidding, Brick?

26:40.182 --> 26:42.850
"Theirs not to reason why.
Theirs but to do--"

26:43.018 --> 26:44.018
And die.

26:44.353 --> 26:47.313
And I don't want to be bored to death
running messages.

26:48.190 --> 26:50.900
I'll see that you get
the more intriguing ones.

26:52.528 --> 26:53.736
(CLATTERING)

26:53.904 --> 26:54.904
Does that help?

26:55.155 --> 26:56.155
Yes!

28:24.995 --> 28:26.371
Any chow, Brick?

28:26.747 --> 28:28.289
Razor blades and toothpaste.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.958
-That's a swell diet.
-What's the dope, Skipper?

-Thank you.
-Yes, sir.

to Garcia.

-Cross, stand by with that 41 boat.
-CROSS: Aye, aye, sir.

29:07.663 --> 29:10.998
Ah, Chief, I'd like to have you keep
sanitary precautions at all times.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.334
I'd like to have you dig a big hole
over there, you know,

29:13.502 --> 29:14.961

29:15.170 --> 29:17.713

whatever you do.

or pull out our troops.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.635
No, I think two boats, Mr. Brickley.

are you, Brick?

instead of the 34. Get her ready.

Hello, Rusty.

53:08.727 --> 53:11.229
Sandy, this is Lieutenant Brickley.
Miss Davyss.

53:11.605 --> 53:13.439
-How do you do?
-Hello.

53:15.317 --> 53:16.568
Nice party?

53:17.194 --> 53:18.528
BOTH: Swell.

53:20.281 --> 53:22.490
-BRICKLEY: That big lug dance?
-Wonderful.

53:23.325 --> 53:25.159
Only stepped on her foot once.

53:26.287 --> 53:27.537
What's up?

53:28.414 --> 53:29.622
It can wait.

53:32.960 --> 53:34.127
Go ahead.

54:00.821 --> 54:03.114
Andy did a pretty good job on the cruiser.

54:03.657 --> 54:05.199
All we've got left is Gardner.

54:05.409 --> 54:08.453
-He's such a young kid for that.
-It's a tricky duty.

54:14.960 --> 54:15.960
RYAN: Why not?

54:16.629 --> 54:17.629
Okay.

54:20.132 --> 54:21.132
Sandy.

54:22.343 --> 54:23.760
Just how bad is that hand?

54:24.094 --> 54:27.388
The finger is open to the bone.
And there's still infection there.

54:28.307 --> 54:29.849
Let's go talk to the doctor.

54:30.184 --> 54:32.143
-Is it healing?
-Yes.

54:32.645 --> 54:35.021
RYAN: Come on, Brick,
help me pour the heat on.

54:42.905 --> 54:44.113
Rusty!

55:46.260 --> 55:48.094
BRICKLEY: How'd it go?
Did you lose anyone?

55:49.096 --> 55:50.096
No, sir.

55:51.098 --> 55:53.099
Mr. Ryan picked us up beautifully.

55:54.268 --> 55:55.435
I'm sorry, sir,

55:55.602 --> 55:57.520
I'd rather have lost my right arm
than the 33 boat.

55:58.772 --> 55:59.939
Couldn't be helped.

56:01.150 --> 56:02.150
Paid off.

56:03.610 --> 56:04.652
Yes, sir.

56:05.362 --> 56:06.362
Thanks.

56:09.658 --> 56:12.618
Andy got a 7.7 through both handcuffs.

56:13.120 --> 56:14.120
Oh?

56:15.622 --> 56:16.622
Snake!

56:17.374 --> 56:18.458
Yes, sir?

56:18.709 --> 56:20.752
You take Andy's place on the 34 boat.

56:22.296 --> 56:23.296
Aye, aye, sir.

56:38.187 --> 56:39.812
That's tough luck, Andy.

56:40.314 --> 56:41.439
How're they feeling now?

56:42.941 --> 56:43.941
They don't.

56:44.902 --> 56:46.944
BRICKLEY: You give us the word
if you need anything.

56:47.738 --> 56:48.738
Sure.

56:49.281 --> 56:50.531
We'll be over to see you.

56:51.116 --> 56:52.992
The job is yours again
the minute you can take it.

56:54.328 --> 56:57.121
I'll give you the nudge...
About next week.

57:00.459 --> 57:01.667
Wind 'em up.

57:23.565 --> 57:24.649
MAHAN: You'd never saw nothin' like it.

57:24.817 --> 57:26.067
Did we blow that Nip out of the water.

57:26.235 --> 57:27.235
Two fish right in the gut.

57:27.402 --> 57:29.862
Get this, Mick.
We started to run like this.

57:30.030 --> 57:32.198
-Then we come--
-We had cupcakes for breakfast.

57:32.366 --> 57:33.449
With raisins.

57:54.221 --> 57:56.055
-Hi.
-Hi.

58:02.146 --> 58:03.563
BRICKLEY: Glad to see you aboard,
Miss Davyss.

58:03.730 --> 58:05.022
Thank you, good evening.

58:05.566 --> 58:10.862
Gentlemen, I would like to present
Mr. Ryan's guest, Miss Davyss.

58:11.446 --> 58:12.572
-ALL: Good evening.
-Good evening, gentlemen.

58:12.739 --> 58:13.739
This is a...

58:14.241 --> 58:15.700
Wait. Wait just a minute.

58:48.192 --> 58:49.192
Mr. Long.

58:49.443 --> 58:50.484
It's a pleasure to have you here.

58:50.652 --> 58:51.652
Thank you.

58:52.070 --> 58:53.404
-Mr. Aiken.
-How do you do?

58:53.572 --> 58:54.739
How do you do?

58:55.199 --> 58:56.324
-Mr. Gardner.
-How do you do?

58:56.700 --> 58:57.700
-Hello.
-Nice having you here.

58:57.910 --> 58:59.368
-Thank you.
-And Mr. Cross.

58:59.536 --> 59:01.454
-Very happy to know you.
-How do you do?

59:10.589 --> 59:12.298
-Good evening, miss.
-Good evening.

59:12.466 --> 59:14.759
-Dinner is served, sir.
-Thank you.

59:15.969 --> 59:18.429
Uh, will you take my place
at the head of the table?

59:37.950 --> 59:41.494
Miss Davyss took care of Rusty
when he was in the hospital at Corregidor.

59:42.579 --> 59:45.748
She's now attached to the field hospital
at Bataan Peninsula.

59:46.333 --> 59:48.501
You mean there are nurses over here
on Bataan?

59:48.669 --> 59:49.669
A few.

59:50.212 --> 59:53.422
(STUTTERS) Wasn't it mean enough
for you in Corregidor

59:53.840 --> 59:55.883
without sending you girls over here?

59:56.510 --> 59:57.760
Well, I asked for it.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.472
You see, over here, I can talk to Rusty
once in a while on the telephone.

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:05.351
GARDNER: Rusty? (LAUGHS)
Well, by George, we're neighbors now.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.603
Next time, you'll have to bring
some of the other girls with you.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:08.771
We'll have a dance, or something.

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:11.107
Be a good idea. (CHUCKLES)

01:00:15.153 --> 01:00:18.281
This is a lovely party. It's swell.

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:20.032
Thanks.

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:23.869
-Benny.
-Yes, sir?

01:00:32.087 --> 01:00:33.337
Thank you.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:35.631
BRICKLEY: Soup.

01:00:48.395 --> 01:00:49.395
Hot.

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:51.355
Biscuits, very good.

01:00:52.024 --> 01:00:53.024
Oh, thank you.

01:00:56.695 --> 01:00:58.321
Real jam, sir.

01:01:00.032 --> 01:01:04.160
Soup, biscuits, jam.
I still say it's a swell party.

01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:07.913
Now all we need is an orchestra
and a floor show.

01:01:08.457 --> 01:01:11.667
Miss Davyss, you're in
for the biggest surprise of your life.

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:13.836
-(RYAN CHUCKLES)
-(STOMPING FOOT)

01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:19.550
(SINGING DEAR OLD GIRL)

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:37.503
(VOCALIZING)

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:41.507
(CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:43.008
Terrific! Wonderful !

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:45.553
(BANGING PLATES)

01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:50.724
If you'll excuse me, I've got
quite a lot of checking to do.

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:51.892
SANDY: Surely.

01:03:01.403 --> 01:03:03.404
Thank you very much for coming over.

01:03:05.073 --> 01:03:07.074
It meant a great deal to all of us.

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:10.202
-Good night, Sandy.
-Good night.

01:03:10.871 --> 01:03:12.288
Me, too. Could I call you "Sandy"?

01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:14.039
-Sure.
-Well, good night.

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:15.458
-Good night.
-Thanks.

01:03:17.085 --> 01:03:19.044
-Good night, Sandy.
-Good night.

01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:23.257
-Good night, Sandy.
-Good night.

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:24.550
Well,

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.678
I don't know
when I've had such a nice time.

01:03:27.846 --> 01:03:28.846
Good night.

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:32.141
And don't forget now, you know,
we're neighbors and everything.

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.310
-Good night.
-Night, Rusty.

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:36.061
RYAN: Night.

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:49.992
How's the chow?

01:03:50.202 --> 01:03:51.243
-Great.
-Great.

01:03:51.411 --> 01:03:53.579
Boy, if I had you on the old Arizona,

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.707
I'd make a pot roast
that would make your hair curl.

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:47.508
Crying?

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:49.301
I'm not crying.

01:04:51.263 --> 01:04:52.263
Oh, it...

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:55.432
(MUFFLED) It's just that they're
such nice guys.

01:04:57.519 --> 01:04:58.686
You aren't kidding.

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:09.989
(MEN SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:12.157
Mr. Brickley and Mr. Ryan.

01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:18.914
(SHELLS EXPLODING)

01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:26.755
Confidentially, Brickley,

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:32.928
the President has ordered me
and certain key personnel to Australia.

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:36.265
Your boats will take us to Mindanao.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:39.685
From there,
an Army bomber will fly us south.

01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:43.022
Do you want to use
all four of the boats, sir?

01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:45.149
Yes. Get them ready.

01:05:45.859 --> 01:05:46.859
This is secret.

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:49.111
Repeat. Secret.

01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:51.655
You'll get the date when it's set.

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:54.116
Aye, aye, sir.

01:05:54.534 --> 01:05:55.534
Just a minute.

01:06:04.919 --> 01:06:07.254
I think you'll find all the charts
you need.

01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:11.884
I'm sure you know
things are not going well with us up here.

01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:13.469
We get the news, sir.

01:06:13.928 --> 01:06:16.889
We're scraping up all the men we can find
to form a naval battalion.

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:18.932
Can you spare any men?

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:22.561
We have two extra crew, sir.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:25.773
I could use them, Brickley.

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:27.441
Yes, sir.

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:34.448
BRICKLEY: We're going to run south
600 miles.

01:06:35.367 --> 01:06:38.410
There's bad weather out there.
It'll be rough going.

01:06:38.787 --> 01:06:41.205
If any boat breaks down,
we'll just have to let her go.

01:06:41.665 --> 01:06:42.665
Expendable.

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:44.500
You know what that means.

01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:47.044
First night's run,

01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:48.754
Cuyo Islands.

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.423
Hole up there during the day.

01:06:51.925 --> 01:06:53.092
Second night's run,

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:55.969
to Cagayan on Mindanao.

01:06:56.763 --> 01:06:58.097
We still hold the airfield there,

01:06:58.264 --> 01:06:59.723
but the Japs are moving pretty fast

01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:02.309
and it's a question
of how long we can hang on to it.

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:09.149
Approach every landfall with caution.
And be prepared to fight or run for it.

01:07:09.317 --> 01:07:12.277
But remember, your primary duty
is to get these people out.

01:07:14.489 --> 01:07:16.990
Rusty will take the Admiral
on the 34 boat.

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:22.037
And I'll take the army personnel with me.

01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:26.291
We'll shove off at 2100.

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:29.670
Motor whaleboat ready?

01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:31.130
CROSS: Whenever you are, sir.

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:33.590
Brick, could Mulcahey
take over the duty for me?

01:07:33.967 --> 01:07:35.426
I'd like to go along and see Andy.

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:37.344
Yeah, sure.

01:07:37.637 --> 01:07:39.054
We'll shove off at 2100.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:50.232
Easy does it. Bring those boards up.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.823
These drums will go overboard
on the first sea we hit.

01:07:58.241 --> 01:08:00.868
Now cross lash them.
Put 'em on right and tight.

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:03.996
That's exactly
what I've been telling them, sir.

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:06.790
Now, let's do it the way
the Captain and I want it done.

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:22.473
(DRUMMING)

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.265
We can take all we got, sir.

01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:27.352
How's Mr. Andrews?

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:30.856
Doctor says he's good
for about eight or nine days.

01:08:31.191 --> 01:08:32.441
Rusty!

01:08:32.692 --> 01:08:34.943
-Will you give him my aloha for me, sir?
-Yeah.

01:08:43.328 --> 01:08:44.953
(ENGINE STARTS)

01:08:46.038 --> 01:08:47.331

01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:27.746
-Lieutenant Brickley.
-Yeah.

01:09:27.913 --> 01:09:29.081
Just for about two minutes.

01:09:29.249 --> 01:09:32.584
Be cheerful and, you know,
give him the old one-two-three.

01:09:33.044 --> 01:09:34.086
Yes, ma'am.

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:44.680
Hiya, Brick.

01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:48.225
Hello, fellas.

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.060
-Hi, Andy.
-Hiya, fella.

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:52.354
How are you feeling?

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.274
(CHUCKLES) What is this?

01:09:55.984 --> 01:09:58.277
-A PT boat convention?
-(ALL LAUGH)

01:09:58.987 --> 01:10:00.195
It's good to see you, fella.

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:02.155
Oh, you look swell, Andy.

01:10:02.323 --> 01:10:04.783
When are you going to quit stalling
and get back to work?

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:06.702
-Oh, any day now.
-(CHUCKLING)

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:08.495
Hey, how's the chow
in this hotel, anyway, huh?

01:10:08.663 --> 01:10:09.663
Wonderful.

01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:12.332
-Squab.
-(ALL LAUGH)

01:10:12.959 --> 01:10:14.626
Say, Mulcahey and Mahan said to say hello.

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:16.503
-So does Cookie.
-The whole gang.

01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:18.672
-How's the 34 boat?
-Fine.

01:10:19.465 --> 01:10:22.634
I suppose Snake's been botching up my job.

01:10:22.844 --> 01:10:24.636
Well, he's no Andrews.

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:28.807
Oh, say, I got some cigarettes here.
Go on, have some.

01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:30.976
-Oh, thanks.
-No, no.

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:32.978
We're keeping him in condition.

01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:34.479
He's trying to take your place.

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:36.607
-Trying to is right.
-(ALL LAUGH)

01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:43.655
Uh, we got a patrol to get ready for.

01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:47.159
Job's yours any time you can make it.

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:48.785
-Thanks.
-So long, Andy.

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:50.329
-Take it easy.
-Take care, Andy.

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:51.788
So long.

01:10:52.624 --> 01:10:53.874
Say, Skipper...

01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:58.503
Sit down, Brick.

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:06.011
That was a nice act you boys put on.

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:09.765
How did you get the word?

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:11.975
Scuttlebutt.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:15.103
Say, Brick...

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:18.231
Here, I'll get it for you.

01:11:25.156 --> 01:11:28.367
If you get through, mail these, will you?

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:31.370
Sure, if there's any mail.

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:34.039
One to Mother.

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:37.250
One to Myra.

01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:39.378
You know, she's at Lockheed.

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:41.463
Yeah.

01:11:43.383 --> 01:11:45.050
I wrote out a will, too.

01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:50.180
That was a pretty good act
you put on yourself.

01:11:53.393 --> 01:11:57.437
Any unfinished business that
you want me to take care of for you?

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:03.443
Anything particular that you'd like
to have me say to your folks,

01:12:03.611 --> 01:12:04.778
or to Myra?

01:12:09.909 --> 01:12:12.995
I guess I've written
about all I had to say, Brick.

01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:18.250
Sorry I couldn't do more for the squadron.

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:43.668
Hello.

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:45.879
Isn't there anybody on duty there?

01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:48.590
Give me the field hospital.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:51.301
This is Lieutenant Ryan speaking, Navy.

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:54.513
I want to talk to one of your nurses,
Lieutenant Davyss.

01:13:55.056 --> 01:13:56.056
Sandy Davyss.

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.517
I don't know her first name.

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:00.102
Sandy. Sandy Davyss.

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:16.952
Hello.

01:14:17.829 --> 01:14:18.870
Oh, what's the use?

01:14:19.038 --> 01:14:20.497
Here. Take it easy.

01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:23.208
-You've got plenty of time.
-(SIGHS)

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:25.460
Keep trying.

01:14:30.675 --> 01:14:32.300
-Bring that sign.
-Yes, sir.

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:43.019
Ten-hut!

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:46.731
At ease.

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:57.576
You're a swell bunch.

01:14:59.537 --> 01:15:01.872
I'm glad to have been
able to serve with you.

01:15:03.875 --> 01:15:07.544
I'd like to be able to tell you
that we were going out to bring back help.

01:15:08.462 --> 01:15:10.046
That wouldn't be the truth.

01:15:11.424 --> 01:15:13.508
We're going down the line to do a job.

01:15:15.094 --> 01:15:17.095
You are going to Bataan with the Army.

01:15:18.222 --> 01:15:20.307
That isn't what you've been trained for.

01:15:21.309 --> 01:15:22.767
But they need your help.

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:24.936
You older men

01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:27.272
with longer service records,

01:15:29.066 --> 01:15:30.525
take care of the kids.

01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:38.116
Maybe...

01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:44.164
That's all.

01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:48.251
God bless you.

-Ryan speaking.
-SANDY: Hello, Rusty.

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:27.624
Hello, Sandy.

01:16:29.126 --> 01:16:30.835
Is the 15th all right with you?

01:16:31.963 --> 01:16:33.088
RYAN: No, it isn't, Sandy.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.758
Would the 16th be better?

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:38.593
Nothing would be better.

01:16:40.096 --> 01:16:41.930
Well, what is this, anyway?

01:16:44.058 --> 01:16:45.517
I guess it's goodbye.

01:16:47.728 --> 01:16:49.062
Oh.

01:16:51.232 --> 01:16:53.900
Can you tell me where you're going?

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:56.569
I wish I could.

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:00.156
Are you coming back?

01:17:02.702 --> 01:17:03.702
I'm not sure.

01:17:05.329 --> 01:17:06.538
But I don't think so.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.961
Well, this is really goodbye, then.

01:17:17.174 --> 01:17:19.050
It's been awfully nice, hasn't it?

01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:21.678
It's been swell.

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:24.889
Look, Sandy, I'm no good at talk.

01:17:25.599 --> 01:17:28.476
I've written you a letter.
Shorty Long will get it to you.

01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:31.813
Sorry, miss. We got to take this out.
We're moving south.

01:17:34.608 --> 01:17:37.569
Hello? Hello? Operator?

01:17:38.029 --> 01:17:39.487
You cut us off.

01:17:40.281 --> 01:17:43.241
A couple of generals?
Couldn't they wait till we were through?

Hello. Hello, put Miss Davyss
back on the line.

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:07.265
Hello!

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.393
Operator, what's gone wrong
with this line?

01:18:12.355 --> 01:18:13.355
Gone dead.

01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:14.773
That's tough, sir.

01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:17.984
Hope what those generals had to say
was important.

01:18:20.321 --> 01:18:21.946
-So long, Doc.
-Goodbye, sir.

01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:23.448
-So long, Willie.
-Bye, sir.

01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:25.450
-Be a good kid.
-Yes, sir.

-So long, Slim.
-So long.

-Same to you, baby.

-So long, Phil.
-You're in the Army now.

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:37.379
Go on and get your feet wet, kid.

01:18:47.014 --> 01:18:48.723
-Ready, Brickley?
-Ready, sir.

(KID EXCLAIMS)

01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:42.420

Good evening, sir.

01:20:56.435 --> 01:20:57.435

Well, on time.

01:23:48.107 --> 01:23:49.649
Only three boats.

01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:52.276
Must have lost one.

BRICKLEY: Orders, sir?

01:25:17.529 --> 01:25:20.531
The squadron will work down here
under General Martin.

01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:22.533
Yes, sir.

01:25:22.743 --> 01:25:24.452
(CLEARS THROAT) We've got
quite a few men at Bataan, sir,

01:25:24.661 --> 01:25:27.038
I'd like permission to go back
and pick them up.

01:25:33.921 --> 01:25:36.923
You've done
all you can up there, Brickley.

01:25:37.716 --> 01:25:38.716
Yes, sir.

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:41.552
Uh, what about aviation gasoline, sir?

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:43.346
We'll try to find everything
that you need.

01:25:43.639 --> 01:25:44.847
What about torpedoes, sir?

01:25:45.057 --> 01:25:47.725
There may be some at Cebu. I'll enquire.

01:25:48.227 --> 01:25:50.561
We've got to have aviation gas
and torpedoes, sir.

01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:51.896
GENERAL MARTIN: I realize that.

01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:55.399
We'll keep you informed
as to enemy activity.

01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:58.611
Plan your own operations
against their ships.

01:25:58.862 --> 01:26:00.488
But report to me daily by phone.

01:26:03.408 --> 01:26:04.867
Aye, aye, sir.

-goodbye, Brickley.
-Goodbye, sir.

-Ryan.
-Goodbye, sir.

01:26:27.641 --> 01:26:29.392
That's tough luck, fellow. What happened?

01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:32.436
Oil failure.
Burnt out every cock-eyed bearing.

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:34.939
There's a shipyard at Cebu.
We'll tow you there.

01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:38.317
-Better start tearing down those engines.
-I've already started.

01:26:39.653 --> 01:26:41.988
-Thanks for the tow, Rusty.
-Por nada.

01:26:43.115 --> 01:26:44.240
I'll do the same for you someday.

01:26:44.741 --> 01:26:45.741
I hope not.

01:26:48.328 --> 01:26:50.830
Wonder what happened to those kids
on the 32 boat.

01:26:51.957 --> 01:26:53.958
They were abeam of us
at 3:00 in the morning.

01:26:54.626 --> 01:26:56.127
Then we missed them.

01:26:57.462 --> 01:26:59.297
Suppose that cruiser got them?

01:27:00.299 --> 01:27:03.301
Oh, stop worrying, Brick. They'll show up.

01:27:06.096 --> 01:27:07.430
I'm going over to the airfield.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.558
Pick up an old crate,
and see if I can find them.

01:27:10.809 --> 01:27:12.143
Take over, will you?

01:27:13.896 --> 01:27:15.813
MAHAN: Now, take it easy.
MULCAHEY: Have a look at that plank.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:17.607
And watch out for the coral.

01:27:19.276 --> 01:27:21.652
Can I have your attention here, men?
Attention, all hands.

01:27:22.029 --> 01:27:25.448
Mr. Brickley has requested
that I make the following announcement.

01:27:26.033 --> 01:27:28.326
For every officer and man
in this squadron,

01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:30.494
for your work in the war to date--

01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:32.371
Happy, get in there
and give him a hand, will ya?

01:27:36.335 --> 01:27:41.714
The General was awarded
the Silver Star for gallantry.

01:27:42.424 --> 01:27:43.507
Junior, get in there and help him.

01:27:48.847 --> 01:27:51.849
JONES: Planking's loose,
and the bottom's full of coral.

01:27:52.643 --> 01:27:53.643
All right.

01:28:00.734 --> 01:28:02.860
-(CHUCKLING)
-Got a little news.

01:28:03.779 --> 01:28:07.198
For every officer and man in the squadron,
for your work in the war to date--

01:28:07.866 --> 01:28:11.577
(CHUCKLES) Excuse me, sir. All this time,
this black cat has been aboard this boat.

01:28:12.079 --> 01:28:15.039
The General was awarded
the Silver Star for gallantry.

01:28:15.332 --> 01:28:18.084
By rights, the black cat
ought to have been aboard the 32 boat.

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:21.212
Maybe this black cat is good luck for us,
the 41 boat.

01:28:21.505 --> 01:28:24.048
Anyway, you've been awarded
the Silver Cat.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.696
Any luck?

01:28:47.406 --> 01:28:48.906
Not a sign of them.

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:11.178
Fire in the paint locker!

01:29:13.849 --> 01:29:14.932
MAN: Come on, son, hurry up.

01:29:16.518 --> 01:29:18.894
All right, Mahan, think fast.
What happened?

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:21.022
It's all my fault, sir.

01:29:21.273 --> 01:29:22.648
You see, I says to Mulcahey,

01:29:22.941 --> 01:29:24.650
-"Let's get the crews a couple of beers."
-Yeah.

01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:26.986
-So, we...
-That's the dumbest excuse I ever heard.

01:29:27.237 --> 01:29:28.946
-I'm sorry, sir.
-And that helps a lot.

01:29:29.114 --> 01:29:31.032
So, when we gets back there,
she was high and dry.

01:29:31.283 --> 01:29:34.243
The engines wouldn't start.
It's just as much my fault, sir.

01:29:34.494 --> 01:29:35.995
Pipe down. I'll take all the raps.

01:29:36.246 --> 01:29:39.248
For two cents,
I'd bust you both to seaman's second.

01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:41.876
Why don't you keep your mouth
out of my business?

01:29:46.423 --> 01:29:49.091
Everything, sir.
Wheels, struts, and shafts.

01:29:58.977 --> 01:30:00.519
-It's all my fault, sir.
-How did it happen?

01:30:00.729 --> 01:30:01.771
There's nobody else to blame, but me, sir.

01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:03.314
-You see--
-How did it happen?

01:30:03.565 --> 01:30:04.565
Well, it's like this, sir.

01:30:04.816 --> 01:30:07.234
You see, we were all hot and tired,
and thirsty, so Slug and I thought

01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:08.944
we'll go up to the canteen
and get a couple of beers--

01:30:09.112 --> 01:30:10.154
Stand by with the 41 boat.

01:30:10.363 --> 01:30:12.490
We'll pass her line, pull her off,
and see what the damage is.

01:30:12.657 --> 01:30:13.657
Yes, sir. But I don't want you to think--

01:30:13.867 --> 01:30:15.868
-How was the beer?
-We didn't have any.

01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:25.836
Okay!

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:46.649
Ready on the 35 boat.

01:30:47.150 --> 01:30:49.568
Ready on the 35 boat!

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:17.805
Repeat the instructions.

01:31:18.098 --> 01:31:21.058
If you're attacked, burn your boats.
We'll try and pick you up.

That's pay enough.

01:32:35.508 --> 01:32:36.800
On half the nearby island.

01:32:37.093 --> 01:32:40.346

have been nosing around for days.

Well, while you've been
cruising around in the Pacific,

01:34:05.765 --> 01:34:08.225
those cracker boxes
have sunk two converted cruisers,

01:34:08.435 --> 01:34:12.604
an auxiliary aircraft carrier,
a 10,000-ton tanker, a large freighter,

01:34:12.856 --> 01:34:15.357
a flock of barges,
and numerous sons of Nippon.

01:34:15.608 --> 01:34:17.067
And also, in our brief career,

01:34:17.235 --> 01:34:20.070
we've carried more messages
than the Western Union.

01:34:31.833 --> 01:34:33.834
And does your crew know about it?

-We'll take eight.

Well, I finally have good news for you.

01:35:23.635 --> 01:35:26.303
Tomorrow, at day break,
the bombers will take off from Australia

01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:28.263
and blast every Jap ship in this area.

01:35:28.473 --> 01:35:29.807
We've been hoping that would happen, sir.

01:35:30.058 --> 01:35:31.892
Yes, but there's a catch in it.

01:35:32.143 --> 01:35:34.186
There's a cruiser up the coast
headed this way.

01:35:34.646 --> 01:35:36.688
Probably has destroyers with her.

01:35:37.148 --> 01:35:40.526
Information says
she's of the Mogami-class.

01:35:41.277 --> 01:35:43.654
Does that mean anything to you?

01:35:43.863 --> 01:35:46.490

Well,

01:35:50.161 --> 01:35:54.164
she'll probably shell these food ships
before we can get them away from the dock.

-That's fair enough.

01:53:38.228 --> 01:53:40.313
The white flag
was hardly hoisted over Bataan

01:53:40.481 --> 01:53:44.150
before Jap artillery
began slamming away at Corregidor,

01:53:44.485 --> 01:53:46.694
our last strong point in the Philippines.

01:53:47.571 --> 01:53:49.322
(MUSIC RESUMES)

01:54:39.456 --> 01:54:41.082
Men, with Mr. Brickley gone,

01:54:41.250 --> 01:54:43.042
I'm gonna carry on
the way I think he would.

01:54:43.293 --> 01:54:44.961
I think you're right about Leyte Island.

01:54:45.128 --> 01:54:48.214
There's some Army men over there.
Maybe we can hold out till help comes.

01:54:48.549 --> 01:54:51.092
Dig in at every bridgehead
and pass, Lefty.

01:54:51.343 --> 01:54:53.094
-Make them pay.
-Check.

01:54:53.971 --> 01:54:54.971
Good luck, fellas.

01:54:55.305 --> 01:54:56.681
ALL: So long, Mr. Ryan.

01:55:01.436 --> 01:55:02.979
Repeat your orders, Snake.

01:55:03.981 --> 01:55:06.983
To find and to report to
General Martin and keep him up to date.

01:55:07.609 --> 01:55:08.859
All right, get going.

01:55:09.861 --> 01:55:12.905
-Old Franklin High, Junior.
-Roosevelt High, sir.

01:55:18.745 --> 01:55:22.832
Dad, I'm gonna try and find Brick.
Why don't you come along with me?

01:55:23.834 --> 01:55:26.002
I've worked 40 years for this, son.

01:55:26.461 --> 01:55:29.005
If I leave it,
they'll have to carry me out.

01:57:15.570 --> 01:57:17.029
Hey, Mr. Ryan.

01:57:20.158 --> 01:57:21.409
RYAN: Hello, kid.

01:57:24.246 --> 01:57:27.248
-Rusty. Hello, Brick.
-Hello, Mr. Ryan.

01:57:27.416 --> 01:57:28.666
We thought the Japs got you.

01:57:28.959 --> 01:57:30.960
Well, I thought they got you, too.

01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:32.420
What happened?

01:57:32.713 --> 01:57:34.630
Ran south through shallow water.

01:57:34.965 --> 01:57:36.215
(CHUCKLING)

01:57:41.805 --> 01:57:43.222
Where's your crew?

01:57:43.932 --> 01:57:46.308
We lost Mahan and Larsen.

01:57:47.018 --> 01:57:49.353
-Couple of the kids got hurt.
-How'd they get Slug?

01:57:50.021 --> 01:57:51.939
Machine gun from a plane.

01:57:53.734 --> 01:57:54.734
That's great.

01:57:57.320 --> 01:57:58.320
That's great.

01:57:59.906 --> 01:58:01.365
Glad to see you back, Mr. Ryan.

01:58:01.825 --> 01:58:02.825
Thank you.

01:58:16.173 --> 01:58:17.673
Where's your boat, Rusty?

01:58:18.675 --> 01:58:20.176
Jap bombers got her.

01:58:21.344 --> 01:58:23.053
We burned the 35 boat.

01:58:24.306 --> 01:58:25.306
The gang headed for Leyte.

01:58:27.934 --> 01:58:28.934
She's through.

01:58:30.145 --> 01:58:32.646
General Martin
turned her over to the Army

01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:35.274
to run errands on Lake Lanao.

01:58:36.359 --> 01:58:38.903
Okay, Navy. We're taking over.

01:58:40.614 --> 01:58:41.614
Okay.

01:59:00.509 --> 01:59:02.384
Okay, Army, take her away.

01:59:44.344 --> 01:59:46.846
All right, gather up your gear.
We're heading out.

01:59:57.899 --> 01:59:59.775
You looking for the Arizona, too?

02:00:01.945 --> 02:00:03.779
Yeah. (SCOFFS)

02:00:22.966 --> 02:00:24.675
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

02:02:25.797 --> 02:02:26.797
Brickley.

02:02:31.928 --> 02:02:34.096
I have orders to fly
you and Ryan to Australia.

02:02:34.431 --> 02:02:35.723
-Australia?
-Yes.

02:02:35.890 --> 02:02:37.766
Also ensigns Gardner and Cross.

02:02:37.934 --> 02:02:39.768
-They're west of town.
-We'll find them.

02:02:40.103 --> 02:02:42.771
Why us?
We're just a couple of snotty lieutenants.

02:02:43.064 --> 02:02:46.233
You men have proved that PT boats
have some value in this war.

02:02:46.693 --> 02:02:49.236
Washington wants you back
in the States to build them up.

02:02:49.404 --> 02:02:50.404
Those are my orders.

02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:53.073
-What about the men, sir?
-There isn't room for them.

02:02:53.283 --> 02:02:56.827
-General Martin, those men--
-There isn't room for them, Brickley.

02:02:57.620 --> 02:02:59.455
-Bridge ready, sir.
-Let her go.

02:03:08.339 --> 02:03:10.049
General Martin, about these men,
I think--

02:03:10.216 --> 02:03:13.927
There isn't room, Brickley.
Report to the airport right away.

02:03:14.095 --> 02:03:16.221
Driver! And you better get going.

02:03:25.690 --> 02:03:27.816
Makes a fine pair of heels out of us.

02:03:47.462 --> 02:03:49.755
Mr. Ryan and I have been ordered out.

02:04:10.026 --> 02:04:11.276
Good luck, sir.

02:04:13.404 --> 02:04:14.863
Good luck to you, Jonesy.

02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:18.659
That goes for you, too.

02:04:20.787 --> 02:04:21.787
Watch him.

02:04:24.541 --> 02:04:25.541
Sir?

02:04:27.877 --> 02:04:29.670
I'd like to shake your hand.

02:04:30.380 --> 02:04:31.880
That'll be a pleasure.

02:04:32.382 --> 02:04:35.342
The book doesn't mean much out here,
so I'm going to say,

02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:38.178
so long, Brick, you've been a swell guy.

02:04:38.972 --> 02:04:40.264
So long, Irish.

02:04:41.516 --> 02:04:42.599
So long, Rusty.

02:04:43.351 --> 02:04:45.227
So long, you big mick.

02:04:50.984 --> 02:04:53.026
Chief Boatswain's Mate Mulcahey.

02:04:54.612 --> 02:04:55.612
Take over.

02:04:56.823 --> 02:04:57.823
Aye, aye, sir.

02:04:59.909 --> 02:05:01.076
Right face!

02:05:02.287 --> 02:05:05.372
Cross step. Follow me!

02:05:44.162 --> 02:05:46.121
(HARMONICA PLAYING)

02:05:58.927 --> 02:05:59.927
-Fourth Marines.
-Forty-one.

02:06:00.637 --> 02:06:01.637
Thank you, sir.

02:06:01.804 --> 02:06:03.889
-Lieutenant Strong.
-Thirty-nine.

02:06:04.641 --> 02:06:05.766
Fine.

02:06:08.311 --> 02:06:10.145
-Here you are.
-Thank you, sir.

02:06:10.813 --> 02:06:12.356
Brickley, U.S. N.

02:06:13.316 --> 02:06:14.399
Number 27.

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:18.028
-Twenty-seven.
-Ryan, U.S. N.

02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:21.031
-Number 28.
-Twenty-eight.

02:06:22.742 --> 02:06:25.327
I'm sorry. I don't know whether
my name's on that list, or not.

02:06:25.703 --> 02:06:27.746
Morton. Major James Morton.

02:06:29.707 --> 02:06:31.833
You're number 31, Major.

02:06:32.085 --> 02:06:33.669
Oh, I get to go?

02:06:34.003 --> 02:06:35.837
Well, each plane holds 30 men.

02:06:36.506 --> 02:06:38.423
If two planes come, you'll get to go.

02:06:38.967 --> 02:06:39.967
Thirty-one. Thank you.

02:06:40.551 --> 02:06:42.302
Wish those kids would show up.

02:06:46.307 --> 02:06:48.475
Hey, Ohio.

02:06:49.519 --> 02:06:52.187
Hiya, Rusty. How are you, fella?

02:06:52.522 --> 02:06:53.522
When did you leave the Rock?

02:06:54.107 --> 02:06:57.150
Oh, four or five days ago, a week.
I don't know.

02:06:58.278 --> 02:07:03.365
Say, remember Sandy,
the little nurse with the green eyes?

02:07:03.783 --> 02:07:04.783
Sure. (CHUCKLES)

02:07:05.410 --> 02:07:06.952
So do 11,000 other guys.

02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:08.578
You know where she is?

02:07:08.997 --> 02:07:12.291
No, I don't know where she'd be now.

02:07:13.334 --> 02:07:15.085
She might be out in the hills.

02:07:16.087 --> 02:07:17.587
Or a prisoner somewhere.

02:07:19.132 --> 02:07:20.132
Swell dish.

02:07:20.717 --> 02:07:23.593
I guess she meant more to you
than she did to the rest of us.

02:07:26.806 --> 02:07:28.390
I sure hope she's okay.

02:07:29.559 --> 02:07:30.559
Yeah.

02:07:32.228 --> 02:07:37.107
Last time I talked to her
was over the telephone on Bataan.

02:07:38.484 --> 02:07:40.152
Voice sounded swell.

02:07:41.362 --> 02:07:44.406
Clear, brave,

02:07:45.992 --> 02:07:47.242
and far away.

02:07:56.669 --> 02:07:59.087
Only one plane.

02:08:00.256 --> 02:08:03.759
Where do you suppose Gardner
and Cross could have gotten to?

02:08:20.234 --> 02:08:21.777
Quite a load, Captain.

02:08:22.362 --> 02:08:25.364
-Hey, Smokey!
-Hey, Joe.

02:08:25.907 --> 02:08:29.117
As I call your names,
kindly step into the plane.

02:08:30.411 --> 02:08:33.330
Number one, Sergeant T.V. Smith.

02:08:35.666 --> 02:08:38.794
Number two, Lieutenant A. C. James.

02:08:41.714 --> 02:08:42.714
Attention !

02:08:48.346 --> 02:08:49.346
Brickley.

02:08:55.353 --> 02:08:59.272
When you see the General,
tell him the end here is near.

02:09:00.024 --> 02:09:04.653
If he should ask you what we want,
tell him a Navy task force.

02:09:04.987 --> 02:09:07.781
A tanker loaded with gasoline
and 100,000 men.

02:09:08.366 --> 02:09:11.159
Give me that, and we can start
taking the islands back.

02:09:11.494 --> 02:09:15.497
I know he probably hasn't got them,
but if he asks you, tell him.

02:09:15.706 --> 02:09:18.125
All right, sir.
Have they located Gardner and Cross?

02:09:18.292 --> 02:09:19.793
No, they're still looking for them.

02:09:27.093 --> 02:09:29.553
Number 27, Lieutenant Brickley, Navy.

02:09:31.180 --> 02:09:33.849
Number 28, Lieutenant Ryan, Navy.

02:09:35.685 --> 02:09:37.519
Number 29, Ensign Gardner.

02:09:40.064 --> 02:09:42.065
Twenty-nine, Ensign Gardner.

02:09:43.985 --> 02:09:45.861
Number 30, Ensign Cross.

02:09:46.696 --> 02:09:48.530
Thirty, Ensign Cross.

02:09:51.075 --> 02:09:53.618
Thirty-one, Major James Morton.

02:09:54.537 --> 02:09:55.537
Here.

02:09:56.706 --> 02:09:59.124
MAN: Number 32, Captain Carter.

02:09:59.792 --> 02:10:00.792
Here.

02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:03.420
That's all.

02:10:10.553 --> 02:10:11.887
So long, Sergeant.

02:10:28.070 --> 02:10:29.571
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

02:10:37.455 --> 02:10:39.873
Major Morton and Captain Carter,
I'm sorry.

02:10:40.249 --> 02:10:42.083
Your places are assigned
to these two men.

02:10:42.376 --> 02:10:43.418
I'm sorry.

02:10:45.213 --> 02:10:47.631
-Sorry we're late, sir. We got strafed.
-We both lost our bikes, sir.

02:10:47.924 --> 02:10:49.299
-Okay.
-I'm sorry, sir.

02:10:49.550 --> 02:10:51.134
-Not at all.
-Good luck, sailor.

02:10:51.302 --> 02:10:54.054
I hope you boys have a smooth trip home.

02:10:54.597 --> 02:10:56.932
Oh, say, if you get through,
would you mail a note to my wife?

02:10:57.099 --> 02:10:58.099
Of course.

02:10:58.518 --> 02:11:01.144
Here's her phone number.
Call her long-distance.

02:11:01.354 --> 02:11:03.688
Tell her the last time you saw me
and that I still love her.

02:11:03.856 --> 02:11:04.856
You bet I will.

02:11:05.191 --> 02:11:06.900
Make no passes at her, sailor.

02:11:07.485 --> 02:11:09.486
-Happy landings!
-Wait a minute.

02:11:10.112 --> 02:11:11.112
You phone her.

02:11:11.531 --> 02:11:13.949
I got business here and
you got business back in the States.

02:11:14.116 --> 02:11:15.367
-Gangway.
-Rusty!

02:11:17.203 --> 02:11:18.245
Who are you working for?

02:11:20.122 --> 02:11:21.122
Yourself?

02:11:22.917 --> 02:11:25.043
He said it, fella.

02:11:34.804 --> 02:11:35.845
Thanks.

02:11:36.847 --> 02:11:38.181
Not at all.

(TAPPING)

02:11:51.445 --> 02:11:52.445
Sir?

02:11:53.656 --> 02:11:55.657
How many more planes are coming in?

02:11:57.326 --> 02:11:58.326
None.

02:11:59.203 --> 02:12:00.245
(SCOFFS)

02:12:00.496 --> 02:12:04.374
Look, son, we're going home to do a job.

02:12:06.002 --> 02:12:08.169
And that job is to get ready to come back.

02:12:10.631 --> 02:12:11.631
Check?

02:12:13.384 --> 02:12:14.384
BOTH: Check.
