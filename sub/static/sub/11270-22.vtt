00:11.720 --> 00:14.293
So, Chuck,
how's the job search going?

00:14.431 --> 00:16.673
l got something,
but l'm not too excited.

00:16.808 --> 00:19.133
l'm a janitor in a biology lab

00:19.269 --> 00:23.183
where they do DNA experiments,
making mutant viruses.

00:23.314 --> 00:25.805
That sounds like a pretty good job.

00:25.942 --> 00:28.397
Makes me nervous,
weird stuff floating around.

00:28.527 --> 00:31.279
- Don't worry. l'm sure it's safe.
- Absolutely.

00:31.405 --> 00:34.192
They take all the right precautions.

00:34.325 --> 00:38.156
l guess you're right.
Must be getting a little paranoid.

00:40.580 --> 00:42.703
l feel better already. See you later.

00:42.833 --> 00:44.113
Take care, Chuck.

02:03.909 --> 02:05.948
<i>Last week on Cheers...</i>

02:06.953 --> 02:09.574
lnteresting.

02:09.705 --> 02:13.655
That was Sam's brother.
He's on his way over.

02:13.793 --> 02:15.121
He hates him.

02:15.253 --> 02:18.289
The guy is better at everything
than l am. He's perfect.

02:19.173 --> 02:21.498
- Nice voice. Who is that?
- Guess.

02:21.634 --> 02:25.002
Your brother is one good-looking guy.

02:25.137 --> 02:26.797
The guy did get me a job.

02:26.930 --> 02:29.884
Hurry up. He's gonna do
some tap-dancing for us.

02:30.017 --> 02:31.676
He's teaching me Spanish.

02:31.810 --> 02:36.139
- You think Diane likes Derek?
- l'll pass her a note in gym.

02:36.272 --> 02:40.400
He's just a man, like any other man
you'd meet in Greek mythology.

02:43.863 --> 02:47.563
Derek just wants to fly me out
to Martha's Vineyard tonight.

02:49.076 --> 02:51.115
ln a plane or on his back?

02:53.539 --> 02:58.117
Whatever you and my brother Derek
wanna do is OK with me. l don't care.

02:58.251 --> 03:01.750
- l'd rather stay with you.
- What? What did you say?

03:03.214 --> 03:05.966
l didn't hear anything.

03:07.719 --> 03:10.755
<i>ls Diane about to fall</i>
<i>for Sam's brother?</i>

03:10.888 --> 03:13.296
<i>Will Sam's heart be broken?</i>

03:13.432 --> 03:16.635
<i>Will Norm find happiness</i>
<i>in his new job?</i>

03:16.769 --> 03:20.517
<i>Will Coach return</i>
<i>to coaching in Venezuela?</i>

03:20.647 --> 03:24.775
<i>Will Carl Yastremski please call</i>
<i>Cheers and ask for the Spitfire?</i>

03:39.915 --> 03:44.791
Well, Coach, it's just clear we've
reached a philosophical impasse.

03:44.920 --> 03:48.087
Much like the question of the tree
falling in the woods.

03:48.215 --> 03:50.006
The what?

03:51.343 --> 03:54.012
The tree falling in the woods.

03:55.305 --> 03:59.385
lf a tree falls in the woods
and there's nobody there to hear it,

03:59.517 --> 04:02.055
does it make a sound?

04:02.186 --> 04:05.472
lf there's nobody there,
how do you know it fell?

04:12.655 --> 04:16.189
- We assume that it fell.
- But you don't know.

04:16.325 --> 04:21.781
OK, l went into the woods yesterday
and saw the tree lying on the ground.

04:22.789 --> 04:27.285
Beavers could have chewed on it
and gently lowered it to the ground.

04:29.462 --> 04:32.379
You got me there on that one.
How about another beer?

04:32.507 --> 04:36.634
l'm telling you, you surprise me.
You're not prepared at all tonight.

04:38.512 --> 04:43.755
l fell asleep while going over my
notes preparing for our conversation.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.932
You do that too?

04:54.277 --> 04:56.519
Coach. Where's Diane today?

04:56.654 --> 05:00.237
She must be out with Derek.
She's been out with him every day.

05:00.366 --> 05:03.283
l'm sick of hearing about her.

05:03.411 --> 05:08.037
Ever since Lady Dye-job arrived,
she gets all the attention.

05:08.165 --> 05:13.290
Nobody cares about me. Nobody asks
what Carla's doing any more.

05:16.423 --> 05:18.462
Come on, now. Be fair.

05:18.591 --> 05:22.091
We weren't that interested
in your life before she got here.

05:26.849 --> 05:29.257
Well, Sam, thanks again.

05:29.393 --> 05:32.643
Thank you for dropping me off.
Sure you can't come in for a drink?

05:32.771 --> 05:35.345
l'd love to,
but l'm in kind of a hurry.

05:39.987 --> 05:42.738
l'm sorry l shrieked the wrong name.

05:42.864 --> 05:44.904
That's OK.

05:48.203 --> 05:50.575
- Hi, everyone.
- Hey, Sam.

05:50.705 --> 05:53.825
Sammy. My, my, Sammy.

05:53.958 --> 05:56.663
Tell me true,

05:56.794 --> 06:00.744
not only did that gorgeous-looking
girl go out with you, she also drove?

06:00.881 --> 06:03.752
She didn't drive, she carried me.

06:05.969 --> 06:08.258
Sam, l'm proud of you.

06:08.388 --> 06:12.552
You took my wimp speech to heart.
Great to see you back in action.

06:12.684 --> 06:16.598
Thank you. lt took my mind off
my brother and your skinny co-worker.

06:16.729 --> 06:19.185
l don't even care
where they are any more.

06:20.191 --> 06:21.899
Where are they?

06:22.944 --> 06:27.689
Bobby and Susie saw them at the
drive-in sharing a Coke and fries.

06:29.950 --> 06:32.026
Afternoon, everybody.

06:32.870 --> 06:37.199
- How you doing, Norm?
- Coach, l'm on top of the world.

06:37.332 --> 06:40.202
Which is a dismal spot
in Greenland somewhere.

06:41.628 --> 06:44.664
- How's your new job coming?
- Don't bring that up.

06:44.797 --> 06:48.380
l am no longer in the employ
of Goldstein, Borman and Kawakami.

06:48.509 --> 06:49.588
What happened?

06:49.719 --> 06:52.340
l discovered
that so-called medical corporation

06:52.471 --> 06:55.140
was a polite term
for a den of thieves.

06:55.266 --> 06:57.803
They're in the business
of cheating on taxes.

06:57.935 --> 07:00.556
So you resigned in protest.

07:00.687 --> 07:03.474
Well, l took a long lunch
and they canned me.

07:05.025 --> 07:08.559
- The last angry man.
- Damn right, l'm angry, Sammy.

07:08.695 --> 07:11.399
Those are rich people
cheating on taxes.

07:11.531 --> 07:14.282
And who has to foot the bill?
Honest folks.

07:14.409 --> 07:16.282
Like me and you,

07:16.410 --> 07:20.739
and all you nice people at the bar
that l've listed as my dependants.

07:22.499 --> 07:26.829
So, where's Diane today?
She's not out with Derek again?

07:28.088 --> 07:29.915
l don't believe it.

07:32.509 --> 07:35.545
What happened to
all the interesting talk around here?

07:35.679 --> 07:39.462
l used to enjoy coming in here
and listening to a good conversation.

07:39.599 --> 07:44.225
Now there's so much gossip, you
should all have dryers on your heads.

07:46.981 --> 07:49.269
- l'm gonna be in the office.
- OK, Sam.

07:49.400 --> 07:53.100
- So what'll you have?
- l'll have a cup of tea.

07:53.237 --> 07:55.562
And l'll have a small sherry.

07:55.697 --> 07:58.188
Now, that sounds nice.

07:59.326 --> 08:03.406
Sherry sounds very nice.
And it is late afternoon.

08:03.538 --> 08:06.076
l think l'll have
a glass of sherry too, please.

08:06.207 --> 08:10.501
- Two sherries.
- Make that a glass of wine.

08:10.628 --> 08:13.961
- White wine.
- Wine.

08:14.090 --> 08:18.169
l haven't had a glass of wine
in ages. ls your wine dry?

08:18.302 --> 08:19.416
Yeah, it's OK.

08:19.553 --> 08:21.711
- Give me some wine, too.
- Two wines.

08:21.847 --> 08:25.844
You know what sounds like fun to me
all of a sudden?

08:25.976 --> 08:28.099
- What?
- A beer.

08:28.228 --> 08:31.679
l haven't had a beer
since l don't know when.

08:32.565 --> 08:35.186
l used to have half a beer
on a hot day.

08:35.318 --> 08:38.437
Well, it's quite cold out today.

08:38.571 --> 08:41.856
Then put a shot of whisky with it
and it's perfect.

08:43.033 --> 08:45.904
Two boilermakers.
Wild Turkey and Bud.

08:50.707 --> 08:52.996
- l'll run a tab.
- Good.

08:59.132 --> 09:01.171
What's wrong, Coach?

09:01.301 --> 09:05.345
l didn't get the job in Venezuela.
They hired another guy.

09:05.471 --> 09:08.591
- They didn't like your Spanish?
- The Spanish was fine.

09:08.724 --> 09:11.476
They didn't like my English.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.642
- That's too bad, Coach.
- Sorry.

09:14.772 --> 09:17.060
Well, <i>que</i> so what, so what.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.865
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.

09:26.991 --> 09:29.945
What are you doing here?
lt's your day off?

09:30.078 --> 09:33.244
l needed to be in a place
where l had a few friends today.

09:33.372 --> 09:35.412
So that's your next stop?

09:38.460 --> 09:41.876
- Not today, Carla, please.
- What can l get you, honey?

09:42.005 --> 09:43.797
l'll have a soda water.

09:44.716 --> 09:48.584
- You never take a day off.
- Thursday's my day off.

09:48.720 --> 09:52.800
- You work every Thursday.
- Yeah, but l go a little slower.

09:55.101 --> 09:59.051
- So, tell me, how are you doing?
- Not very well.

09:59.188 --> 10:02.889
- What is it?
- lt's Derek.

10:03.025 --> 10:05.065
What about him?

10:06.695 --> 10:10.562
He's flying to Paris today,
and he wants me to go with him.

10:10.699 --> 10:12.822
He's a charming man, Coach.

10:12.951 --> 10:15.157
He's everything
l've been looking for.

10:15.287 --> 10:17.991
And l think
he's interested in me, too.

10:18.123 --> 10:20.578
What a lousy break.

10:22.877 --> 10:25.997
Wait a minute, Diane.
Maybe it's good.

10:26.130 --> 10:28.206
- lt is good.
- l'll tell you why.

10:28.341 --> 10:32.967
The second l looked at you and Derek,
l said, ''There goes a cute couple.''

10:33.095 --> 10:35.800
Yeah.

10:35.931 --> 10:37.556
What about Sam?

10:37.683 --> 10:40.553
Sam and Derek
are a little cuter, yeah.

10:42.646 --> 10:44.769
Coach, let me ask you a question.

10:44.898 --> 10:49.773
You're asking a guy who's taken
a lot of fast balls in the head.

10:52.321 --> 10:55.156
Are you sure
you want to ask the question?

10:55.283 --> 10:59.280
- Do you think l'm a smart person?
- The smartest person l ever met.

10:59.411 --> 11:04.572
Well, l, Diane Chambers, bred
and educated to walk with kings,

11:04.708 --> 11:07.875
once offered a full scholarship
at the Sorbonne,

11:08.003 --> 11:12.748
have become attracted to a
six-foot-three-inch bubble-gum card.

11:14.426 --> 11:17.877
l think l can help you
with the sore buns, Diane, but...

11:21.516 --> 11:24.967
..the rest of what you say
is all over my head.

11:25.102 --> 11:27.937
Coach, l'm making a confession here.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.519
Not just to you, but to myself.

11:31.442 --> 11:33.979
Maybe l'll feel better
after l say this.

11:34.111 --> 11:36.150
l...

11:37.447 --> 11:39.321
l got it.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.857
You're hot for Sam's chilli.

11:43.036 --> 11:48.196
l think Keats would have said it
differently,... but l'll accept that.

11:48.332 --> 11:53.124
Look, if you like Sam at all, l don't
understand what the problem is here.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.412
Derek's making a commitment.

11:55.548 --> 11:59.711
All l ever get from Sam
is adolescent flirtation.

11:59.843 --> 12:02.085
l'm not sticking around for that.

12:02.220 --> 12:05.138
lf he'd give me something,
anything, l'd stay.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.808
Diane, you don't understand Sam.

12:08.935 --> 12:12.885
Sam's the kind of a guy, you know,
he keeps his feelings to himself.

12:13.022 --> 12:17.933
The more he cares about something,
the less he shows it.

12:18.069 --> 12:20.394
l've been with him
through his divorce,

12:20.529 --> 12:23.400
his boozing, the end of his career.

12:23.532 --> 12:27.826
And let me tell you, the tougher
things got, the cooler he got.

12:27.953 --> 12:32.662
lt's a damn sure bet that if
he's not expressing himself to you,

12:32.791 --> 12:35.329
he's nuts about you.

12:35.460 --> 12:37.499
Or he couldn't care less.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.046
Do you mind if l say something?

12:43.176 --> 12:45.666
Of course not, Norman.

12:45.803 --> 12:50.548
Sometimes a man and a woman
are so afraid of rejection

12:50.683 --> 12:54.632
that neither will take the first step
of admitting their true feelings.

12:56.396 --> 12:59.183
Norman, that's beautiful.

12:59.316 --> 13:01.771
l do have a romantic side, Diane.

13:02.736 --> 13:06.021
l know l make a lot of jokes
about Vera, but...

13:06.155 --> 13:11.232
the truth is if that woman
ever packed her bags and left me,

13:11.369 --> 13:13.942
l don't know what l'd do... first.

13:22.421 --> 13:26.465
Well, l guess l have no choice
but to force the issue. Where's Sam?

13:26.591 --> 13:28.584
He's in the office, honey.

13:28.718 --> 13:31.885
l'll tell him
l'm going away with his brother.

13:32.013 --> 13:36.224
lf he's honest and doesn't hide
behind that tough jock façade,

13:36.350 --> 13:37.726
l'll stay.

13:37.852 --> 13:40.888
But if he does one of his
gratuitous jokes, l'm leaving.

13:41.022 --> 13:45.482
- l swear it.
- Wait a minute, Diane. Hold on.

13:45.609 --> 13:49.310
You're putting your whole future
on the line in this one moment.

13:49.446 --> 13:52.731
You're letting your whole life
turn on this one response?

13:52.866 --> 13:55.950
- You're right.
- Can it wait till l go to the head?

13:57.162 --> 13:58.822
No.

13:58.955 --> 14:00.994
l'll hear about it.

14:02.083 --> 14:04.835
Coach, what did you do that for?

14:04.961 --> 14:08.080
That was our chance
to get rid of her once and for all.

14:08.214 --> 14:10.918
- Are you crazy?
- Crazy, Carla?

14:12.092 --> 14:14.132
Crazy like a doorknob.

14:21.768 --> 14:23.511
Hi, Diane.

14:23.645 --> 14:27.227
Sam, your brother Derek has asked me
to go to Europe with him,

14:27.357 --> 14:29.396
so l've come to say goodbye.

14:30.068 --> 14:33.152
Dammit. l didn't need to hear that.

14:33.279 --> 14:35.604
What's wrong?

14:35.740 --> 14:39.488
lt's too late to put a help-want ad
in tomorrow's paper.

14:44.998 --> 14:47.619
Goodbye, everyone.

14:47.751 --> 14:51.451
l'm leaving now.
l'll miss you all very much.

14:51.588 --> 14:53.627
Bye, Diane.

14:54.924 --> 14:56.964
Bye-bye.

15:02.848 --> 15:05.766
Sorry, honey,
l'm not interviewing till Monday.

15:05.893 --> 15:08.562
Get this straight.
l'm going away with him.

15:08.687 --> 15:10.347
Good. Have fun.

15:10.481 --> 15:13.185
This could lead to marriage.
Probably will.

15:13.317 --> 15:15.772
- Will lead to marriage.
- Great.

15:15.902 --> 15:17.859
We'll be Diane and Derek Malone.

15:17.988 --> 15:21.606
We'll buy a spread somewhere
and call it the Double-D.

15:21.741 --> 15:23.568
lt'll make a nice brand.

15:23.701 --> 15:26.987
Children. We'll have blonde,
blue-eyed children everywhere.

15:27.121 --> 15:30.371
- Have them brush after every meal.
- l'll be your sister-in-law.

15:30.499 --> 15:34.082
You'll come over for dinner
and say, ''She sets a good table.''

15:34.211 --> 15:37.082
Had to say something.
You just fed me.

15:39.091 --> 15:42.294
l'll send you Christmas cards.
''To a wonderful brother.''

15:42.427 --> 15:44.633
Nice to be remembered
on the holidays.

15:44.763 --> 15:48.926
The cards will have pictures of us.
Derek and l, the kids, the dogs.

15:49.058 --> 15:51.514
The blonde ones will be the kids?

15:53.312 --> 15:55.850
- This is alright with you?
- lf you're happy.

15:55.982 --> 15:59.481
- l'm ecstatic. Goodbye.
- See you at the wedding.

15:59.610 --> 16:03.524
- Do l get to kiss the bride?
- l think you know what you can kiss.

16:08.160 --> 16:11.196
This is it, everyone.
l bid you a fond farewell.

16:11.329 --> 16:14.283
l've enjoyed knowing you.
You've brought a lot to my life.

16:14.416 --> 16:16.408
Bye.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.801
- Goodbye, everyone.
- Bye.

16:31.890 --> 16:35.591
- Farewell.
- Get the hell outta here. Go.

16:37.354 --> 16:39.393
l won't let it end this way.

16:42.484 --> 16:44.939
l've had warts
that went away quicker.

16:51.492 --> 16:55.276
- What did l hit?
- My nose. You're supposed to knock.

16:55.913 --> 16:59.329
You were coming out to say
something to me. What is it?

16:59.458 --> 17:02.791
- l wasn't gonna say anything.
- Yes, you were. What was it?

17:02.919 --> 17:04.663
- Go to the airport.
- Say it.

17:04.796 --> 17:06.836
No.

17:19.101 --> 17:21.887
What are you doing with that?

17:22.021 --> 17:25.354
- Tell me what you were gonna say.
- Don't do that. l hate that.

17:29.861 --> 17:33.479
l hate that. Please stop.
Would you just stop? Put that down.

17:35.909 --> 17:39.278
- Please don't go.
- Ask me nice.

17:39.412 --> 17:43.540
- Come on.
- l deserve that much. Ask me nice.

17:43.666 --> 17:46.999
Just put it down.
Put the blackboard down.

17:48.629 --> 17:50.668
Put it down.

17:54.051 --> 17:55.545
Please stay.

17:56.345 --> 17:58.800
- Why should l?
- Go on, get out.

18:00.473 --> 18:04.305
l'm not sticking around in the hope
something will happen between us.

18:04.436 --> 18:08.515
- What is it you want from me?
- For you to tell me what you want.

18:08.648 --> 18:12.728
l'll tell you exactly what l want.
l want to know what you want.

18:13.694 --> 18:15.770
You're doing it again.

18:15.905 --> 18:20.068
Listen, will you just explain
one thing to me?

18:20.200 --> 18:22.656
lt is very important to me.

18:23.996 --> 18:27.993
- Why aren't you with Derek?
- Because l like you better.

18:30.001 --> 18:35.707
Diane, listen. All the jealousy
l felt for my brother over the years

18:35.840 --> 18:40.003
is nothing to what l felt
these last five minutes.

18:47.309 --> 18:50.476
We're about ready to start
something that might be great.

18:50.604 --> 18:52.643
Yeah.

18:54.232 --> 18:57.482
Maybe we should kiss or something.

18:57.610 --> 18:59.650
We're not gonna just kiss.

19:01.823 --> 19:07.030
We're about to start something.
A kiss is where you start, isn't it?

19:07.161 --> 19:10.364
You don't make an announcement
when you kiss someone.

19:10.498 --> 19:14.246
lt wasn't an announcement.
l didn't want to catch you off guard.

19:14.376 --> 19:18.753
On our first kiss, it's OK to be
off guard. You should be swept away.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.252
l was.

19:21.383 --> 19:25.926
Nobody's swept away when they say,
''Maybe we should kiss.''

19:29.432 --> 19:31.471
You're right.

19:32.685 --> 19:35.437
When l do it, l won't say anything.

19:37.231 --> 19:39.686
No. This isn't right, either.

19:42.319 --> 19:45.604
l didn't say anything.
l was swept away.

19:46.448 --> 19:50.398
The moment's not right.
We're too aware of what we're doing.

19:50.535 --> 19:54.615
You're right. This whole thing
is not going the way it should.

19:54.747 --> 19:58.496
Maybe we should just forget
about the kiss and hit the sack.

20:01.087 --> 20:04.420
This is the dumbest conversation
we have ever had,

20:04.548 --> 20:08.961
which means it's the dumbest
conversation that's ever been.

20:09.094 --> 20:12.214
Maybe this whole thing
is just a mistake.

20:12.347 --> 20:14.838
- What thing?
- This thing we're trying to do.

20:14.975 --> 20:17.548
Every time we try to get together,
it goes wrong.

20:17.686 --> 20:21.434
Just cos l'm a neat-looking guy
and you're kinda hungry...

20:21.564 --> 20:23.106
Hungry?

20:23.233 --> 20:28.439
No, listen. What l mean by that
is you've been here a long time.

20:28.571 --> 20:31.240
lf it was gonna happen,
it would have happened by now.

20:31.365 --> 20:33.821
lt's silly of us
to try to make it happen.

20:33.951 --> 20:38.826
Fine. You tell me this
now that l've let Derek go.

20:38.956 --> 20:41.909
Don't throw Derek in my face.
You never cared for Derek.

20:42.042 --> 20:45.043
- You just used him to trap me.
- Trap you?

20:45.170 --> 20:49.002
l'm the best thing to happen to you
and you're too stupid to realise it.

20:49.132 --> 20:54.208
You're the worst thing that happened
to me. Before you came, l was happy.

20:54.345 --> 20:56.966
You believe
you were happier before you met me?

20:57.098 --> 21:00.182
Hell, yes. How do you think it feels

21:00.309 --> 21:03.144
to be attracted to someone
that makes you sick?

21:10.444 --> 21:13.148
l could write a book on the subject.

21:13.280 --> 21:17.491
You can't shut up long enough
to write a cheque.

21:17.617 --> 21:19.942
You are trying to change the subject.

21:20.078 --> 21:23.493
The subject is, you can't
shut up long enough to kiss me.

21:23.623 --> 21:27.750
To save your life, l bet you
couldn't shut up for 30 seconds.

21:27.877 --> 21:29.952
- Make it ten.
- l most certainly could.

21:30.087 --> 21:33.337
- Alright, let's see.
- You're going to time me?

21:33.465 --> 21:37.000
That's right. l'm gonna time you.
Ten seconds starting now.

21:37.135 --> 21:39.887
- This is the most...
- You want to try again?

21:41.639 --> 21:46.800
l wasn't really trying. You want to
see me do this? Fine. Starting now.

21:47.520 --> 21:50.141
- This is the craziest thing...
- Really good.

21:50.273 --> 21:54.056
So l can't do it.
Silence is overrated anyway.

21:55.986 --> 21:58.358
- At least l have something to say.
- l don't?

21:58.489 --> 22:00.814
The last conversation
l had with Derek

22:00.949 --> 22:05.410
was about walking on the moors
like Heathcliff and Catherine,

22:05.537 --> 22:07.576
and l threw it all away for this.

22:07.706 --> 22:11.121
l'll tell you what you do.
Why don't you...

22:12.252 --> 22:14.291
Get out of here. Go on.

22:16.797 --> 22:18.837
Take her with you. Go on. Get out.

22:25.347 --> 22:28.798
- Don't push me.
- Why don't you just go find Derek?

22:28.934 --> 22:30.309
Fine.

22:30.435 --> 22:33.436
Shouldn't be hard to find him.
Just follow the applause.

22:33.563 --> 22:36.019
- Maybe l can still catch him.
- Fine.

22:36.149 --> 22:38.722
While you're floating around,
remember this:

22:38.860 --> 22:41.695
you are the nuttiest, the stupidest,

22:41.821 --> 22:43.979
the phoniest fruitcake l ever met.

22:44.115 --> 22:46.403
You are the most arrogant,
self-centred...

22:46.534 --> 22:49.700
- Shut up. Shut your fat mouth.
- Make me.

22:49.829 --> 22:55.119
Make you? My God, l'm gonna bounce
you off every wall in this office.

22:55.250 --> 22:58.251
Try it, and you'll be
walking funny tomorrow.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.670
Or should l say funnier?

23:04.175 --> 23:08.671
l always wanted to pop you one.
Maybe this is my lucky day.

23:08.805 --> 23:12.304
- You disgust me. l hate you.
- Are you as turned on as l am?

23:12.433 --> 23:14.472
- More.
- Bet me.

23:18.522 --> 23:23.599
- <i>l'm gonna nibble on your ear.</i>
- <i>Don't tell me.</i>
