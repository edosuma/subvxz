Oh, and your fit's on the table.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.665
Yeah.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.502
Hey, man,
if you want this money,

00:34.535 --> 00:36.070
we need this college fan base.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.371
And, you know,

00:37.405 --> 00:39.140
first it's this,
then it's Spring Fling,

00:39.173 --> 00:40.841
and that's $60K, guaranteed.

00:48.682 --> 00:49.817
You heard me, right?

00:49.850 --> 00:51.819
Nigga, I heard you.

00:51.852 --> 00:53.821
$60K.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.959
You do realize I'm trying
to make you more money?

00:58.992 --> 01:01.028
-That's how I make money.
-Look, no shade,

01:01.061 --> 01:02.830
but we both got different
standards of living, a'ight?

01:02.863 --> 01:04.632
-Yeah, that's true,
but obviously...

01:04.665 --> 01:05.866
-Oh!
-Oh, fuck, man!

01:05.899 --> 01:07.135
Tracy, man, what'd I tell you

01:07.168 --> 01:08.702
about breaking in
my goddamn apartment, man?

01:08.736 --> 01:10.504
This .38 almost sliced your ass.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.906
But, nigga,
you know I'm staying here.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.575
Yeah, but what happened
to "one week," Tracy, man, huh?

01:14.608 --> 01:15.843
One week was months ago.

01:15.876 --> 01:18.579
Man.

01:18.612 --> 01:21.149
You know what?
Whatever, man. Whatever.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.252
Where y'all going?

01:24.285 --> 01:26.954
We're going somewhere not fun.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.656
We're leaving right now.
It's-it's... We got to leave.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.057
That's funny.
-Right now.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.459
'Cause I ain't asked when.
I asked where.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.760
Man, we doing a show.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.028
At Statesboro. For free.

01:35.062 --> 01:36.597
TRACY:
Yo, let me roll, man.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.199
You need security, right?

01:38.232 --> 01:39.900
Look, all I need
is a hotel floor, bruh.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.235
EARN:
We're not staying in a hotel.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.404
Plus, don't you have to tell
your P.O. if you leave?

01:43.437 --> 01:46.039
Damn, yo, you Fulton
County Police or something?

01:46.073 --> 01:47.408
Yo, hold on, hold on.
Bring it back, man.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.542
What you mean, no hotel?

01:48.576 --> 01:49.943
Hey, Earn.

01:49.977 --> 01:53.181
You're not allergic
to jicama, are you

01:53.214 --> 01:55.583
I don't... No.
I don't know. Listen...

01:55.616 --> 01:58.286
-Cool.
-It's not a hotel, per se,

01:58.319 --> 02:00.454
but-but I think

02:00.488 --> 02:02.756
it might be better. Huh?

02:07.695 --> 02:09.930
-Oh, wait.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.599
Th-That's the girl
when both our phones died.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.701
Exactly.
And I found her on Instagram.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.769
And guess what? She love you.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.705
And she runs the Pajama Jam.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.139
Okay, we can just stay

02:19.173 --> 02:21.074
with her and pocket the money
from the hotel.

02:21.108 --> 02:24.312
Ooh. She cute as hell, too, boy.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.180
You stay trying to be slick.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.781
Man, I am slick.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.083
Her roommate?
Treasurer.

02:30.117 --> 02:31.485
That means
Spring Fling next year.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.187
-That's, like...

02:33.221 --> 02:34.455
probably more than $60K

02:34.488 --> 02:35.623
if I can, you know,
sweet-talk her.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.591
All right, man. We'll see.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.327
You know, any bad bitch

02:39.360 --> 02:42.062
with over 3K followers,
it could be tough.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.997
You know,
she got an unrealistic worldview

02:44.031 --> 02:45.299
on how the world works.

02:45.333 --> 02:48.202
She only got,
like, 300 followers.

02:48.236 --> 02:50.604
That's even weirder.

02:50.638 --> 02:51.905
See.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.774
Oh, found my fork.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.043

02:56.076 --> 02:58.679
-Oh, I'm ready, too. All right.
-Yeah.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.515
Let's do this, baby.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.717
Oh.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.819
We're...

03:05.853 --> 03:07.255
we're not gonna have
enough room.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.690
And we're leaving right now.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.191
Nigga, I'm ready right now.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.361
Yeah, man.
$200 for security right here.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.363
-Bring all black, boy.
-Say no more.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.797
Come on, man, we're leaving.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.832
Oh, shit,

05:50.851 --> 05:52.720
-I see you brought one extra.
-EARN: Yeah.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.922
That's Tracy. Uh, he won't be
staying here, though.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.524
-I think he's staying
with family.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.191
Nah, nah. I'm staying here.

05:58.225 --> 06:00.794
We can find space.

06:00.828 --> 06:03.030
Cool.
-Great.
-VIOLET: Okay, come in.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.865
Find space.

06:04.898 --> 06:08.035
Okay, guys,
just make yourselves at home.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.170
Uh, so, you guys
remember Erika, right?

06:10.203 --> 06:12.540
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah. And, uh, you met Honey.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.575
EARN:
Mm-hmm.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.410
So, you two can sleep
in Erika's room,

06:16.444 --> 06:19.146
and Tracy, you can sleep here.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.848
TRACY:
All right, cool.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.683
You got cameras
around the perimeter?

06:22.716 --> 06:25.018
-Uh...
-I'm Paper Boi's security.

06:25.052 --> 06:28.288
He's not really security,
but he'll be fine.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.192
Hey, uh, let me show you
where you're sleeping.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.662
All right.

06:38.832 --> 06:41.469
Hey, you need a hand, big dog?

Okay.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.242
Nigga, are you eating
chocolate chips?

06:49.276 --> 06:50.811
Yeah, bruh.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.452
Mmm.

06:58.486 --> 07:00.988
You can sleep
on the bed with me.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.792
No, no, that's cool.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.426
I can sleep over here.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.430
Don't be stupid.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.466
Come here.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.135
Come on.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.170

Yeah.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.753
See?

07:32.786 --> 07:34.788
This is nice.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.559
Mm

07:38.592 --> 07:40.928
Can I tell you something?

07:43.597 --> 07:45.966
I had a dream about you.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.838
We were holding each other,

07:50.871 --> 07:54.307
naked, by this river,

07:54.341 --> 07:58.145
and you were
this beautiful white crane.

07:59.780 --> 08:03.083
And I was
this magnificent crocodile.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.754
And we were just laying there.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.456
-Hmm.
-Holding each other for warmth.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.194
And then I ate you.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.300
There was blood everywhere.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.739
And then this,
like, intense light

08:25.773 --> 08:29.543
just shot through my belly.

08:29.577 --> 08:32.445
And I knew that meant
that we were connected.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.684
I knew this would happen.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.719
Eventually.

08:40.420 --> 08:42.122
ALFRED:
Mm-hmm.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.962
Hey, what's up, team Paper Boi?

09:21.995 --> 09:24.564
-Don't be rolling up
on my mans like that, bruh.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.900
-All right, man.
-EARN: Hey.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.702
We know them.
They just performed.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.037
What was that all about?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.739
VIOLET:
Oh, my God. I'm such a fan.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.073
-I loved your mixtape.
-You're crushing
this shit tonight, man.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.775
-Thanks, man.
-That's good shit.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.610
-You want to get, like,
a picture or something?

09:36.644 --> 09:38.345
Like those pajamas.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.180
-Yeah, you know.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.515
-Yo, that was a great show.
-Good for a college set.

09:42.549 --> 09:44.551
This kid's killing it.
Clark, you killed that tonight.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.654
Oh, thanks, man.
Yo, y'all were dope, too.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.722

No, man, we gonna hang back

09:53.426 --> 09:55.562
-Uh, I don't think we...
-CLARK: Dang, bro.

I'm sorry about that.
We do got bottles

Carson Flex gonna pull up.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.334
-VIOLET: Oh, yeah, we'll hang.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.703
-Oh, yeah.

10:02.736 --> 10:03.937
-You can go with her.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.538

in modern literature,

10:50.183 --> 10:52.319
and she's actually
writing a paper on you.

10:52.352 --> 10:55.155
What, like, a Paper Boi paper?

10:55.188 --> 10:56.790
-Yeah, yeah.
All right.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.525
-I can feel that.
-That's what I'm talking about.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.060
-You're very aware
of your words.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.294
You're the only rapper
doing that right now.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.662
I appreciate that.

11:02.696 --> 11:05.632
Yo. Should we save Alfred?

throw a girl down

21:02.562 --> 21:04.564
-I saw it.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.232

21:12.739 --> 21:15.107
And you still put me
in the same room with her ass

21:15.141 --> 21:16.609
so you could save the same
amount of money I would

21:16.643 --> 21:18.177
have made in an hour
or less off the block.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.847
