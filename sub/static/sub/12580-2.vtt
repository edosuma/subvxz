00:36.236 --> 00:38.067
When can I try her out, Hank?

00:38.171 --> 00:41.607
I bet she's got enough power
to lift me off the ground!

00:43.176 --> 00:45.872
It's a leaf blower, Bill, not a jetpack.

00:46.312 --> 00:49.281
Guess who's running
for an unprecedented fourth term...

00:49.382 --> 00:51.850
as president of the Arlen Gun Club?

00:52.085 --> 00:56.488
I'll give you a hint.
He made love to my wife last night.

00:59.793 --> 01:03.388
Dang it, Dale.
I didn't let Bill put a personal ad up there...

01:03.496 --> 01:06.056
and I sure as hell won't let that up.

01:12.539 --> 01:15.133
[l Fought The Law
by Bobby Fuller Four playing]

01:20.680 --> 01:21.908
Macaroon?

01:22.148 --> 01:26.244
I've got entrance-wound size
and exit-wound size.

01:26.886 --> 01:28.911
Dale, every year I vote for you...

01:29.022 --> 01:31.991
just to get my hands
on one of your fine macaroons.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.186
Well, in that case, Jim,
take two and vote twice.

01:35.328 --> 01:36.693
That's a good one.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.161
Mad Dog, cookie?

01:40.366 --> 01:43.233
Hats off, boys. It's the First Lady.

01:45.171 --> 01:50.074
If you're not going to respect the man,
Mad Dog, at least respect the office.

01:50.410 --> 01:53.971
Gribble, I wouldn't vote for a clown
like you if I had a gun to my head.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.638
See?

01:56.015 --> 01:58.074
Hey! Watch your mouth, Mad Dog!

01:58.184 --> 02:00.652
While you were safely tucked away
in prison...

02:00.753 --> 02:03.153
Dale was out there kicking ass
for the highest bidder.

02:03.256 --> 02:04.223
Yeah. Right.

02:04.324 --> 02:06.918
Or don't you get
Soldier of Fortuie in the hole?

02:08.094 --> 02:09.618
Paid ad don't mean nothing.

02:09.729 --> 02:12.357
I bought a knife from an ad
in the back of that magazine.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.865
Said it wouldn't break off in a man's skull.

02:14.968 --> 02:15.957
Crap.

02:16.636 --> 02:17.603
Tell him, Dale.

02:17.704 --> 02:21.140
Tell him about the time you assassinated
that Central American dictator.

02:21.241 --> 02:24.074
-Yeah!
-Again? Gladly.

02:24.611 --> 02:29.548
The generalissimo was guarded better
than a Mafia don's virgin daughter.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.412
We needed the element of surprise...

02:31.518 --> 02:35.887
so me and my team showed up
disguised as flower-delivery men.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.823
He answers the door, thinking
someone sent him a bouquet of roses.

02:40.226 --> 02:41.693
But instead...

02:42.595 --> 02:44.722
he's pushing up daisies!

02:45.999 --> 02:47.125
That's a good one.

02:52.038 --> 02:53.471
[All exclaiming]

02:55.575 --> 02:58.442
Well, I'll be danged!
An accidental discharge.

02:58.545 --> 03:02.003
Or was there a Central American dictator
hiding in the cash register?

03:04.484 --> 03:06.816
That's one for the safety video.

03:09.155 --> 03:10.713
Come on, guys! Lighten up.

03:16.229 --> 03:18.527
-Anyone want a beer?
-Yeah.

03:18.631 --> 03:20.360
-Sure.
-Read my mind.

03:28.141 --> 03:31.872
[Singing] Dale had
ai accideital discharge

03:31.978 --> 03:33.570
Stop laughing at me!

03:33.680 --> 03:37.309
-I'm a laughingstock!
-Dale, calm down.

03:37.417 --> 03:40.682
In a couple of weeks, I'm sure one of
those guys will accidentally shoot off...

03:40.787 --> 03:43.153
someone's toe, and this'll all be forgotten.

03:43.256 --> 03:46.714
Oh, God!
If that happened, I'd kiss his bloody nub.

03:50.163 --> 03:51.221
[Crashing]

03:55.702 --> 03:57.727
Fresh batch of macaroons, Jim?

03:57.837 --> 03:59.862
Whoa! Don't shoot!

04:03.443 --> 04:06.139
Good one, Jim. Very topical.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.646
I'll just put the cookies over on the....

04:11.317 --> 04:13.342
You're going down, Gribble.

04:13.453 --> 04:16.889
And unlike your macaroons,
you're staying down.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.252
[All laughing]

04:21.361 --> 04:25.320
Hey, Dale, you look kind of sad for a guy
who's in a propane dealership.

04:25.898 --> 04:28.492
Mad Dog's challenging me for president...

04:28.601 --> 04:31.468
and he's already got the Black vote. Earl.

04:31.904 --> 04:33.098
And the gay vote.

04:33.773 --> 04:34.762
Earl.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.039
So things are gonna be a little tense
with Earl.

04:38.144 --> 04:39.543
You're still gonna win the election.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.239
You don't understand.

04:42.348 --> 04:46.614
Me having an accidental discharge
is like you giving a sales pitch...

04:46.719 --> 04:51.315
for a grill and not even mentioning
the convenient warming plate.

04:51.991 --> 04:55.324
I can't even.... No. God, no!

04:55.428 --> 04:56.759
God, yes!

04:56.896 --> 05:01.094
Mad Dog's even sent out invitations
to his inauguration party.

05:01.567 --> 05:05.799
Why did I pull my gun during the
flower-delivery story?

05:06.139 --> 05:08.539
Because it makes it more exciting!

05:08.808 --> 05:10.799
But now look at me!

05:12.078 --> 05:13.568
Mommy! It's burning!

05:15.948 --> 05:19.213
-Oh, that hurts!
-I'm unfit to carry a weapon.

05:38.571 --> 05:40.198
[Dale crying]

05:43.443 --> 05:47.812
How long am I gonna have to look
at Dale moping around in his underwear?

05:47.914 --> 05:49.677
Oh, there goes the underwear.

05:49.782 --> 05:54.685
I can honestly say this is the first time I've
ever seen anyone as depressed as I am.

05:55.588 --> 05:58.455
-It's scary.
-We've gotta do something to help him.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.526
Tell you what, man,
I broke up with a chick....

06:00.626 --> 06:03.094
Just give.... Could give a little ol',
dang ol' little puppy, man.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.188
That's a great idea! We'll give Dale a dog.

06:06.499 --> 06:07.989
Nice work, Boomhauer.

06:08.101 --> 06:11.127
I have to say, I am not wowed
by the puppy idea.

06:11.237 --> 06:16.140
But here's what we do know.
A gun is a penis substitute.

06:16.242 --> 06:20.941
So Dale losing the Gun Club presidency
is like Dale losing his....

06:21.080 --> 06:22.638
-Penis?
-Exactly!

06:23.116 --> 06:25.812
Now, how do we give Dale back his penis?

06:25.985 --> 06:28.886
We anonymously answer his
Soldier of Fortuie ad...

06:28.988 --> 06:32.446
and send him on a mission
even a moron could do.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.056
When he completes it...

06:34.160 --> 06:38.460
he will happily be back in his
pathetic little bubble of self-delusion!

06:38.664 --> 06:41.531
And kudos to me for coming up
with the idea.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.296
Macaroon?

06:44.937 --> 06:46.734
You, too?

06:49.509 --> 06:50.737
[Phone ringing]

06:52.078 --> 06:53.204
This is Dale.

06:53.312 --> 06:55.940
Yes, I'm calliig about your ad,

06:56.482 --> 07:00.851
It's a sky-blue Schwinn
in 68%%  mint condition.

07:01.053 --> 07:05.080
I'm calling about your
Soldier of Fortuie ad.

07:05.458 --> 07:08.689
I'm paid up.
My wife sent the check last week.

07:08.795 --> 07:11.423
I'm tryiig to hire you, you idiot,

07:11.531 --> 07:12.896
Who is this?

07:14.100 --> 07:17.194
You don't know me. But my name is....

07:18.571 --> 07:21.131
Frank! It's Frank Hill! Wait, no.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.264
-Fred.
-Fred Hill.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.399
Mr. Big.

07:23.509 --> 07:26.569
My name is Mr. Big.

07:26.712 --> 07:27.736
Yes, yes, yes!

07:28.548 --> 07:32.245
Are you available
for a top-secret mission tomorrow?

07:32.351 --> 07:34.717
Let me check my appointment book.

07:34.821 --> 07:38.951
Kidnap, kidnap, coup.
Sure, I can squeeze you in.

07:39.225 --> 07:42.126
Excellent. Mr. Big is pleased.

07:43.095 --> 07:45.962
Tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.,
go to the bus station.

07:46.499 --> 07:49.229
We'll call you with further instructions.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.201
Daddy's back!

07:59.178 --> 08:00.167
Coconutty.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.423
-How long we been on stakeout?
-Three minutes.

08:11.524 --> 08:14.391
-I'm starving.
-We'll get a snack after.

08:15.127 --> 08:16.151
And I'm horny.

08:26.305 --> 08:27.397
[Phone ringing]

08:28.274 --> 08:32.232
-Go.
-This is Mr. Big, I tell you what.

08:32.745 --> 08:37.705
In the lobby, you will find an aluminum
briefcase underneath a bench.

08:37.817 --> 08:42.150
[Whispering] Tell him to get a Twix bar
from the vending machine.

08:42.255 --> 08:43.244
[Shushing]

08:43.356 --> 08:46.120
Take the briefcase to the skating rink...

08:46.225 --> 08:49.683
across town and put it in the dumpster.

08:49.996 --> 08:51.088
Twix!

09:17.490 --> 09:18.787
Briefcase!

09:19.992 --> 09:22.085
What the hell are you doing?

09:23.729 --> 09:24.696
Give it.

09:25.531 --> 09:26.759
Pocket sand!

09:28.434 --> 09:31.494
He took the wrong briefcase!
Dang it, Dale!

09:40.646 --> 09:41.840
[Phone ringing]

09:42.481 --> 09:45.075
The falcon has the egg.

09:45.184 --> 09:47.311
By egg, I mean briefcase.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.215
Oh, and this is Dale, from the ad.

09:50.356 --> 09:52.586
There's been a change in plans.

09:52.758 --> 09:57.661
Your new mission is to take the briefcase
to the lost and found at the bus station.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.229
Wait a minute.

09:59.332 --> 10:03.029
I don't recall a change in plans
being in the original plan.

10:03.135 --> 10:05.695
What exactly am I carrying in this case?

10:05.805 --> 10:08.706
I'll ask the questions around here, Gribble.

10:08.808 --> 10:11.402
And right now I don't have any.

10:11.510 --> 10:12.977
It's drugs, isn't it?

10:13.079 --> 10:16.708
Well, if you want a mule,
go to the pet store, Big!

10:19.452 --> 10:20.419
Mercenary.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.851
""To Zander. Happy Birthday. Love, Daddy.""

10:29.562 --> 10:30.529
Daddy?

10:36.469 --> 10:40.428
There's no drugs!
Oh, my God, I've been set up!

10:41.841 --> 10:44.401
-Where are the drugs?
-What drugs?

10:44.510 --> 10:49.038
The drugs that the drug lord will search
for in each and every one of my cavities...

10:49.148 --> 10:51.446
when I present him
with an empty teddy bear.

10:51.550 --> 10:53.450
I can't die on my first mission!

10:53.552 --> 10:55.383
It's bad for business!

11:09.301 --> 11:12.361
Thank God, Hank!
Someone's trying to kill me!

11:12.471 --> 11:15.201
And this time I'm not just saying that
to get attention!

11:16.575 --> 11:19.043
I should have known
it was too good to be true.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.409
Fourteen years I've been running that ad.

11:21.514 --> 11:25.177
Not one call! Then suddenly, one call.

11:25.317 --> 11:26.716
I'm being set up.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.677
But who hates me? No one!

11:29.789 --> 11:31.780
Wait. Mad Dog.

11:32.158 --> 11:35.423
But who would stand to gain
from killing me? No one!

11:35.761 --> 11:38.229
Wait. Mad Dog.

11:38.798 --> 11:41.426
Mr. Big is Mad Dog!

11:41.534 --> 11:44.662
What? No, no! Mr. Big is not Mad Dog!

11:44.770 --> 11:46.601
Mr. Big is...

11:48.140 --> 11:50.131
not Mad Dog.

11:50.776 --> 11:52.471
Oh, God, I'm a dead man.

11:52.578 --> 11:55.274
If you guys are seen with me,
Mr. Big will kill you, too!

11:55.381 --> 11:56.348
So get out of here.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.917
Hank, Boomhauer, you got a lot to live for!

11:59.018 --> 12:02.078
Bill, you can stay or go, doesn't matter.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.080
-Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
-Dale, what are you doing?

12:05.624 --> 12:08.855
I'm gonna kill Mr. Big before he kills us!

12:10.796 --> 12:12.423
Mr. Big's gonna kill us!

12:15.334 --> 12:17.962
Quick, Nancy! Plan 51 Tango!

12:18.070 --> 12:19.799
What are you talking about, sug'?

12:19.905 --> 12:21.429
Fifty-one Tango!

12:21.540 --> 12:23.872
In the event of a hostile takeover
of the Gun Club...

12:23.976 --> 12:27.844
resulting in a Dale-threatening situation,
I flee to Costa Rica!

12:28.914 --> 12:32.873
Why do we even have the drills
if you aren't gonna pay attention?

12:34.220 --> 12:35.710
Well, I don't hear any girlish screams.

12:35.821 --> 12:38.085
So either Dale's not here yet or he's dead.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.923
The invitation says we're supposed
to bring chips and dip.

12:44.296 --> 12:46.491
We ain't got no chips and dip!

12:51.403 --> 12:52.893
[Alarm sounding]

12:58.511 --> 13:02.413
Trespassers.
If I shoot them, I'm going back to jail.

13:03.482 --> 13:04.949
But I can't not shoot them.

13:09.889 --> 13:12.221
Dang, man. You can talk about a....

13:14.593 --> 13:16.823
-Bill, watch out!
-What?

13:20.766 --> 13:23.963
I'm too fat! I'm too fat!

13:24.170 --> 13:26.661
Hang on, fellas. Help is on the way!

13:31.544 --> 13:34.138
I'm okay. This skeleton broke my fall.

13:43.122 --> 13:45.989
Joseph, I waited at the mall for two hours.

13:46.392 --> 13:49.691
You know I don't trust
anyone else's opinion on swimsuits.

13:49.795 --> 13:50.819
Sorry.

13:50.930 --> 13:53.626
I had to cut my hair to make a moustache
for my dad.

13:53.732 --> 13:54.960
We're going on a trip.

13:55.067 --> 13:58.434
-ln my dad's truck?
-Your dad gave it to me.

13:58.537 --> 14:01.233
He's buying a convertible.
I wasn't supposed to say anything...

14:01.340 --> 14:04.332
but here it is. He's having a midlife crisis.

14:04.443 --> 14:07.105
He'll probably leave your mother,
and it's partially your fault.

14:08.047 --> 14:11.380
Now, be good boys and go get
my flip-flops. They're under the couch.

14:12.084 --> 14:13.415
Oh, and bring the couch.

14:16.922 --> 14:19.390
See that nasty stain on the carpet?

14:19.758 --> 14:21.919
Well, you better start talking,
or you're gonna end up...

14:22.027 --> 14:23.961
just like the guy who spilled that red wine.

14:24.063 --> 14:26.463
Okay, okay, just calm down.

14:26.599 --> 14:30.091
You seem like a reasonable fellow, so
you'll probably get a chuckle out of this.

14:30.202 --> 14:33.296
-Dale's coming to kill you!
-I knew it!

14:33.672 --> 14:35.401
Now, how's he planning on doing it?

14:35.507 --> 14:39.637
Hey, man, what are you talking about?
I don't know a dang ol' thing, man.

14:39.745 --> 14:41.178
Playing dumb, huh?

14:41.280 --> 14:43.271
Oh, good. Now I get to torture you.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.613
Jim! Go get your jumper cables.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.621
There wasn't anything on the invitation
about taking hostages.

14:50.723 --> 14:54.022
Fifteen minutes ago we were talking
about microwaving a pizza!

14:54.126 --> 14:55.115
What happened here?

14:57.129 --> 14:58.357
[Cell phone beeping]

14:58.464 --> 14:59.453
What's that?

14:59.565 --> 15:01.999
Man, that dang ol' cell phone.
I could be talking to Shavonne, man.

15:02.101 --> 15:04.092
You know, we were gonna go have dinner,
rent a movie...

15:04.203 --> 15:05.727
you know, make a movie, too, man.

15:05.838 --> 15:09.501
Maybe I can hit the redial button
with my nose and call for help.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.641
-It's our only hope.
-Go for it!

15:18.550 --> 15:19.608
[Phone ringing]

15:19.718 --> 15:22.380
-Beep! The number you have--
-Dale, it's Haik,

15:22.655 --> 15:25.522
Mad Dog is holdiig us prisoier
at his house,

15:25.658 --> 15:27.626
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, Hank!

15:27.726 --> 15:30.889
Joseph, forget the flip-flops!
Just get the couch!

15:32.798 --> 15:34.231
Is that my dad?

15:34.433 --> 15:36.367
If he's not gonna make it home
for dinner...

15:36.468 --> 15:38.698
ask him if I can have his pork chop.

15:38.804 --> 15:43.537
Bobby, you'll be having your dad's pork
chop every night for the rest of your life.

15:43.642 --> 15:46.668
Wait.
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.272
Retraction.

15:48.380 --> 15:53.249
Bobby, you will not be having your dad's
pork chop tonight or any other night.

15:53.352 --> 15:54.614
You hear that, Hank?

15:54.720 --> 15:56.813
Bobby's not having
your pork chop, damn it!

15:56.922 --> 16:00.756
-I'm on my way!
-No, Dale, Just call the cops,

16:03.429 --> 16:05.397
Oh, my God! What the hell are you doing?

16:05.497 --> 16:08.466
Nothing. I swear.
I was just calling for help!

16:09.301 --> 16:10.700
Give me that!

16:12.938 --> 16:14.872
Oh, my God! Come on.

17:01.587 --> 17:02.952
-Get down!
-No!

17:11.195 --> 17:15.633
-Dale, did you call the cops?
-Cops? Relax, Hank.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.963
You're with a professional
soldier of fortune.

17:18.069 --> 17:21.631
You are not a soldier of fortune!
You're not a soldier of anything!

17:21.740 --> 17:24.800
The only soldier here is Bill,
and he cuts hair.

17:24.943 --> 17:26.342
I'm so scared.

17:26.444 --> 17:29.312
You're nothing but a bunch of stories
you read in a magazine...

17:29.415 --> 17:31.440
written by bigger liars than you.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.344
You want me to save us
from Mr. Big or not?

17:34.453 --> 17:38.549
Dang it, Dale.
Mad Dog is not Mr. Big, I am Mr. Big.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.694
-No, you're not.
-I am Mr. Big.

17:43.929 --> 17:48.332
But I've known you since the
second grade! When did this happen?

17:48.867 --> 17:49.959
First grade?

17:50.069 --> 17:52.833
It happened when you shot
that stupid cash register.

17:52.938 --> 17:54.667
We sent you on a phony mission.

17:55.174 --> 17:59.577
No, it was more like a phony errand.
And you couldn't even get that right.

18:02.414 --> 18:05.781
I was just trying to make you feel better
without having to talk to you.

18:05.884 --> 18:09.718
Now, which one of you fellows
has always been afraid of drowning?

18:09.822 --> 18:13.019
Mad Dog, you'll want to hear this.

18:13.125 --> 18:17.255
My friends were just asking about
my work for the ClA.

18:17.362 --> 18:18.659
Knock it off, Dale.

18:18.797 --> 18:23.700
There's no way they'd let one of their
contract killers die in a situation like this.

18:24.203 --> 18:25.795
What? Copy that.

18:26.171 --> 18:28.002
What are you doing?
Who are you talking to?

18:28.107 --> 18:30.803
He's talking to me. Yeah. Copy that.

18:30.909 --> 18:32.809
Okay, Dale. Talk to you later.

18:32.911 --> 18:36.108
In about two minutes, a ClA SWAT team...

18:36.215 --> 18:39.651
is gonna swarm this place like flies on Bill.

18:39.751 --> 18:41.116
You're bluffing.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.586
Dale, shut up or you're gonna get us killed.

18:44.656 --> 18:48.251
You know, you'd be amazed
how a few flowers...

18:48.360 --> 18:50.794
could really brighten up this room.

18:51.029 --> 18:52.462
[Alarm sounding]

18:59.037 --> 19:02.495
Oh, my God!
Dale's flower-delivery-man routine?

19:02.608 --> 19:03.836
It's the ClA!

19:19.525 --> 19:22.289
We ain't scared of the ClA! Right, men?

19:22.394 --> 19:25.557
Jim, go in the kitchen
and get my box of grenades.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.462
-Third shelf behind the cake mix.
-No way!

19:28.567 --> 19:31.661
I'll have cake with you anytime,
but you shoot your own feds!

19:31.770 --> 19:34.671
Yeah, Mad Dog!
There's only one man I'd take a bullet for...

19:34.773 --> 19:36.240
and he's home making my supper!

19:37.676 --> 19:38.973
So that's how it's gonna be?

19:39.444 --> 19:41.912
Well, you can put those flowers
on your graves.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.276
I'm flying free.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.588
Oh, man! By the size of those bouquets,
they're packing some serious heat.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.952
Dale, call them off!

19:53.058 --> 19:56.152
Please, Dale! They'll listen to you.
You're one of them.

19:56.828 --> 19:59.922
-I'll make it up to you. I swear!
-Well, I could.

20:00.299 --> 20:02.927
But calling off the ClA seems like a job...

20:03.035 --> 20:05.731
best suited for the president
of the Gun Club.

20:06.171 --> 20:09.231
All in favor of re-electing
Dale Alvin Gribble...

20:09.341 --> 20:13.368
who's currently running on the
""Save your sorry asses"" platform...

20:13.745 --> 20:15.713
-say aye.
-Aye!

20:20.419 --> 20:24.116
I got 47 dozen roses for a Dale Gribble.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.715
How embarrassing.
I seem to have forgotten all my money.

20:28.060 --> 20:31.587
I knew he was a company man.
He's flashing his ClA badge.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.993
But that guy's my best friend,
and he'll cover me.

20:36.635 --> 20:39.729
Holy smokes!
He dropped the hammer on Mad Dog!

20:46.645 --> 20:49.808
I'll just slip away
and live to fight another day.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.952
I'll be damned if I let
those jack-booted thugs...

20:57.055 --> 21:00.513
put my yearbook photo all over the CNN!

21:02.894 --> 21:05.055
It got pretty hairy in there.

21:06.632 --> 21:08.259
I've seen hairier.

21:08.433 --> 21:12.267
Well, I haven't. But then again,
I'm not a professional mercenary.

21:12.638 --> 21:14.196
Nice work, Dale.

21:14.473 --> 21:17.442
I mean, nice work, Dale.

21:24.483 --> 21:27.646
Wait a minute. Did we untie Bill?

21:27.753 --> 21:30.688
I'm okay. I just fell in the hole again.

21:32.557 --> 21:33.854
One more time, Dale.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.427
Tell us the story about how you saved
all of us from Mad Dog.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.962
Again? Gladly.

21:41.099 --> 21:44.125
It was 3:00 p.m. yesterday.

21:44.236 --> 21:48.434
The Gun Club was filled with the smell
of intrigue and coconut.

21:48.740 --> 21:50.731
I needed to know who I could trust.

21:50.876 --> 21:52.036
So I pretended...

21:52.144 --> 21:57.081
to accideitally discharge my weapoi
iito the cash register,

22:30.048 --> 22:31.913
HANK: Mr, Big is pleased,

22:32.305 --> 22:38.866
