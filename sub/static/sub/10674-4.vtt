Previously on Underground...

00:02.102 --> 00:03.852
The thing's worth more
than your life, boy!

00:03.855 --> 00:05.154
It's my fault... if anybody

00:05.190 --> 00:07.190
gonna be punished, it's gonna be me...

00:07.225 --> 00:09.409
Boy's of age on to becoming a man.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.693
Now would be a good time
for his father to be here.

00:11.696 --> 00:13.696
Everything happened so fast.

00:13.748 --> 00:14.781
I never gave any thought

00:14.833 --> 00:16.449
as to how our new roles

00:16.501 --> 00:17.583
would affect our everyday lives.

00:17.619 --> 00:18.701
You sold my wife.

00:18.703 --> 00:20.670
You think you're
better than me, don't you?

00:20.705 --> 00:21.587
...gal stick her nose up at me.

00:25.176 --> 00:26.542
Come on, we gotta run!

00:26.544 --> 00:27.710
He dead.

00:40.892 --> 00:42.240
Mr. Bill?

00:47.899 --> 00:49.591
Time to get on up now.

01:42.954 --> 01:44.651
Bill? You in there?

01:46.207 --> 01:47.173
Help! Help!

01:47.208 --> 01:48.758
We need some help in here!

Miss Mary complaining about

02:42.263 --> 02:43.763
her honey tea not being brought up yet.

02:43.815 --> 02:45.348
All right, go get it ready for her.

02:45.350 --> 02:46.516
Rosalee usually the one that...

02:46.568 --> 02:48.150
I didn't ask who usually the one.

02:49.771 --> 02:51.521
Miss Ernestine, you know
what the alarm's about?

02:51.523 --> 02:53.105
Never mind what's going on outside.

02:53.157 --> 02:54.740
Plenty to worry about in here.

02:54.776 --> 02:55.942
Like getting these windows open,

02:55.994 --> 02:57.944
so we can catch the cross breeze.

02:57.996 --> 02:59.529
Have you seen Rosalee this morning?

02:59.531 --> 03:01.664
No, ma'am.

03:26.224 --> 03:27.390
Hey!

03:29.444 --> 03:31.561
They want to see you at the overseer's.

03:33.197 --> 03:34.363
...at roll call.

03:34.399 --> 03:36.065
Only one missing is that blacksmith.

03:36.662 --> 03:38.494
How the hell
did he even get off the grounds?

03:38.529 --> 03:39.619
Ain't sure, boss.
The boys down at the bridge,

03:39.654 --> 03:40.570
they ain't seen nothing.

03:40.572 --> 03:41.571
Stine, I need you to patch Bill up

03:41.623 --> 03:43.005
best you can till the doc arrives.

03:43.041 --> 03:45.458
That boy was limping,
and you're telling me

03:45.493 --> 03:47.326
he just managed to slip past your men?

03:47.378 --> 03:49.745
We got the dogs out
trying to pick up his scent.

03:49.747 --> 03:51.497
We'll have his ass
back here by nightfall.

03:51.549 --> 03:53.332
For the sake of your job, you better!

03:53.384 --> 03:54.550
We're on lockdown till then.

03:54.586 --> 03:56.252
I want eyes on every slave

03:56.304 --> 03:57.522
at all times.

03:58.756 --> 04:00.473
Bill say anything when you found him?

04:00.508 --> 04:01.757
Uh, no, sir.

04:03.595 --> 04:05.428
Hold on, now, I'm trying to help you.

04:07.070 --> 04:08.764
Bill, what the hell happened in here?

04:10.852 --> 04:13.102
He gonna open that wound again
he don't stop moving.

04:13.154 --> 04:16.105
Hold him down so she can finish.

04:17.442 --> 04:21.238
Bill, tell us what happened.
Why did Noah attack you?

04:27.785 --> 04:29.619
Rosalee...

04:33.091 --> 04:34.624
What did he say?

04:36.894 --> 04:39.712
Rosalee.

04:43.211 --> 04:45.217
Heard they messed up Mr. Bill real bad.

04:45.269 --> 04:46.469
They had to run.

04:46.471 --> 04:47.803
They took the harness.

04:47.805 --> 04:49.138
We got to go, too.

04:49.140 --> 04:50.306
Tonight.

04:50.308 --> 04:51.807
Catch up with Noah.

04:51.809 --> 04:53.643
Tell me you ain't thinking he's
still out there waiting for us.

04:53.695 --> 04:54.810
I know he is.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.979
He wouldn't just leave me behind.

04:56.981 --> 04:58.397
He done already left you behind.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.484
He done left us all behind.

05:01.536 --> 05:03.152
Ain't nobody going nowhere now.

05:03.154 --> 05:05.488
Not with the whole
plantation on lockdown.

05:05.490 --> 05:08.824
I knew this whole thing was a bad idea.

05:14.373 --> 05:16.561
You used to live with the Injuns, right?

05:17.030 --> 05:19.335
For a while, in my youth.

05:19.337 --> 05:21.554
That's where you learned
about tracking and hunting.

05:21.589 --> 05:22.972
That's right.

05:23.007 --> 05:25.180
And you taught my dad all that?

05:25.876 --> 05:27.393
I did.

05:29.425 --> 05:31.063
You know what he does with it now?

05:37.559 --> 05:39.238
Your pa ever tell you that story

05:39.273 --> 05:40.990
about them two wolves?

05:41.025 --> 05:42.192
No, sir.

05:45.613 --> 05:46.746
Inside each of us,

05:46.781 --> 05:48.407
there's these two wolves.

05:48.950 --> 05:52.451
The evil one, he lives on anger, envy,

05:53.429 --> 05:56.480
greed, resentment and lies.

05:57.208 --> 06:00.543
And the good wolf,
he lives on peace and love,

06:00.595 --> 06:02.679
humility and truth.

06:03.681 --> 06:06.048
Now, these two wolves,

06:06.100 --> 06:07.695
they're at war with each other.

06:08.603 --> 06:10.704
But only one can survive.

06:12.849 --> 06:13.977
Which one?

06:15.443 --> 06:17.059
The one you feed.

06:25.829 --> 06:27.153
He knows how to read.

06:27.795 --> 06:28.871
Seems like he's doing
good with his schooling.

06:28.906 --> 06:32.408
When I asked him why he hit
the other boy, he had no answer.

06:32.410 --> 06:34.543
I'm sure you understand
why that's worrisome.

06:35.316 --> 06:36.162
I'll talk to him.

06:36.214 --> 06:39.965
Mr. Pullman, if I may,
it might take more than talk.

06:40.001 --> 06:42.835
Children pick up their behavior
from their parents.

06:43.189 --> 06:45.421
Ben's mentioned you've been away a lot.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.760
You won't need
to concern yourself with my son

06:50.762 --> 06:51.894
from here on out.

06:51.929 --> 06:53.095
Thank you, ma'am.

06:53.147 --> 06:55.314
Good day.

06:57.628 --> 07:01.687
Miss Charlotte would want him
to finish some more schooling.

07:01.739 --> 07:03.105
And if you ask me...

07:03.157 --> 07:05.107
I didn't ask you.

07:05.109 --> 07:06.575
Boy needs to learn a trade.

07:07.643 --> 07:09.862
Land is dead, all the livestock's gone.

07:11.012 --> 07:12.782
It's the only thing
I've got left to give him.

07:15.111 --> 07:16.860
He can handle it.

07:17.257 --> 07:19.338
He ain't the only one I'm worried about.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.208
Out there, you're gonna
have to make choices.

07:22.260 --> 07:24.176
And having your boy with you

07:24.212 --> 07:26.629
is gonna change the way you make them.

07:29.180 --> 07:30.549
Ain't gonna change nothing.

07:35.473 --> 07:37.273
That man, what was his name?

07:37.308 --> 07:39.308
Clyde. Said he was gonna help us.

07:39.310 --> 07:40.643
When'd any white folks
try and help us, huh?!

07:40.695 --> 07:41.644
We need to get out of here.

07:41.696 --> 07:42.978
We need to stay calm.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.647
That man cannot be reasoned with.

07:44.699 --> 07:47.032
The things that he's
saying... he's unhinged.

07:47.068 --> 07:48.984
All the more reason
we need to remain calm.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.569
Clyde will return for them soon.

07:50.621 --> 07:52.404
We'll get it all sorted out.

07:52.456 --> 07:54.874
But until then, let's just not
try to agitate them any more.

07:54.909 --> 07:56.075
Get your ass up here.

07:56.828 --> 07:58.210
Get up!

07:58.246 --> 07:59.829
Please, don't hurt him!

07:59.831 --> 08:00.663
Quiet!

08:00.665 --> 08:02.798
I knew you was lying to me.

08:02.834 --> 08:03.833
Now I got the proof.

08:03.835 --> 08:04.967
Found slave bills in the office.

08:05.002 --> 08:05.918
Wash, hold that up!

08:05.970 --> 08:08.304
No, that's not...

08:08.339 --> 08:09.255
That's an abolitionist newspaper.

08:09.307 --> 08:11.590
What? What's abolitionist?

08:11.642 --> 08:14.727
It's an article about freeing
slaves, not capturing them.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.011
Maybe you's confused.

08:16.013 --> 08:18.347
Think I could forget anything
about that day?

08:18.804 --> 08:20.516
Day they took my wife, huh?

08:20.518 --> 08:21.984
Nah, that was him... right here.

08:22.019 --> 08:24.236
You the one that sold Tempie.

08:24.272 --> 08:26.355
And I want to hear you say it.

08:26.693 --> 08:28.023
I have never owned or sold slaves.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.359
Stop lying to me.

08:30.411 --> 08:31.994
"I have always expected

08:32.029 --> 08:33.996
"to see abolition at the ballot-box,

08:34.030 --> 08:35.635
"renovating the political action

08:35.671 --> 08:36.698
- What the hell you doing?
- "of the country...

08:36.701 --> 08:38.250
"dispelling the sorcery influences

08:38.285 --> 08:39.690
"of party... breaking asunder...

08:39.745 --> 08:41.086
- Quiet!
- He readin' this.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.705
- Don't sound like no slave bill.
- "breaking asunder...

08:42.707 --> 08:44.673
- He's making it up!
- "...stirring up

08:44.709 --> 08:46.208
the torpid consciences of voters..."

08:46.210 --> 08:47.376
- That fast?
- Of course that fast!

08:47.428 --> 08:48.544
I think he telling the truth.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.212
"...rescinding all laws... solely..."

08:51.515 --> 08:53.883
Come on, everybody just calm down!

08:55.386 --> 08:57.688
I'm so tired I could
barely see straight.

08:58.556 --> 09:00.222
And I'm mighty hungry.

09:00.224 --> 09:04.526
And I'm sure that they got
plenty of food. Huh?

09:05.446 --> 09:07.229
Josey...

09:07.231 --> 09:10.733
why don't we get something
for our stomachs...

09:10.785 --> 09:12.451
and talk this all through

09:12.486 --> 09:15.037
before we do something we regret.

09:20.745 --> 09:22.328
- Food?
- Yeah.

09:22.380 --> 09:23.913
Food.

09:23.915 --> 09:25.130
Yeah.

09:25.166 --> 09:27.299
All right, Wash.

09:27.335 --> 09:28.930
I hear you.

09:32.523 --> 09:35.674
I always wanted to dine
like the white folks do.

09:52.109 --> 09:54.109
Miss Susanna told me to come down

09:54.111 --> 09:56.161
for them animals you made
for the mobile.

09:56.963 --> 09:58.447
I got some, somewhere over here.

10:06.457 --> 10:08.924
Tell me what you know about that Noah.

10:09.531 --> 10:11.627
- Not much.
- She ain't do this on her own.

10:11.629 --> 10:13.128
I know he filled her head with runnin'.

10:13.130 --> 10:14.964
She's not a little girl anymore, Mama...

10:14.966 --> 10:16.432
Were they together at that dance?

10:17.068 --> 10:18.934
Maybe. I didn't go.

10:18.970 --> 10:21.854
You workin' in this shop
with him all day, every day,

10:21.889 --> 10:23.355
and you tellin' me

10:23.391 --> 10:24.339
you ain't know nothin'?

10:26.682 --> 10:28.277
Something about this funny to you?

10:29.021 --> 10:30.612
You best be getting back up
to that big house

10:30.648 --> 10:32.114
before they get suspicious.

10:38.489 --> 10:40.489
Rosalee live up
in that big house with you,

10:40.541 --> 10:42.988
all day, every day...
she your damn daughter,

10:43.040 --> 10:44.434
and you don't know what she up to,

10:44.469 --> 10:45.627
yet you comin' all the way down here

10:45.663 --> 10:46.770
to ask me about Noah?

10:47.248 --> 10:49.268
Now I'm glad you finally
got a use for me.

10:49.293 --> 10:50.499
We gonna do this now?

10:50.501 --> 10:52.418
Rosalee's got her head
in a vise, and you want to talk

10:52.470 --> 10:54.529
about your sad feelings,
about what I done to you?

10:54.564 --> 10:56.801
Maybe she runnin' 'cause
of what you done to her, Mama.

10:56.837 --> 10:58.507
You ever think about that?
Huh? Or that she's sick

10:58.559 --> 11:00.843
of all this? But you-you
always know best, huh?

11:00.845 --> 11:02.728
Stop it! Stop!

11:02.763 --> 11:04.263
Ain't no time for this.

11:05.124 --> 11:07.066
We got to find a way
to help your sister.

11:07.101 --> 11:08.817
Mm-hmm. Well...

11:08.853 --> 11:11.186
maybe this is a problem
you can't solve, Mama.

11:11.651 --> 11:13.655
You ain't seen the overseer's cabin.

11:14.525 --> 11:16.692
She was fighting for her life in there.

11:17.408 --> 11:19.677
And you just givin' up on her.

11:20.504 --> 11:22.998
- You ain't nothin' but a coward.
- This ain't on me!

11:24.201 --> 11:26.190
She wasn't even supposed to run.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.190
Wasn't supposed to?

11:28.557 --> 11:30.372
What was supposed to happen?

11:32.954 --> 11:35.094
Tell me everything you know.

11:53.271 --> 11:54.904
We ain't that far from Macon.

11:54.939 --> 11:56.606
Rollers gonna have them dogs
on our scent soon enough.

11:56.608 --> 11:58.824
A moment's what we got,
then we keep moving.

12:00.194 --> 12:02.014
I'm gonna find you
something else to wear.

12:02.178 --> 12:04.212
No. No. Don't-don't leave me.

12:04.214 --> 12:05.213
I'll be back, I promise.

12:05.265 --> 12:06.798
But-but... how am I gonna know it's you

12:06.850 --> 12:07.882
and not somebody else?

12:08.704 --> 12:09.934
Uh, h-how about I whistle?

12:09.969 --> 12:11.552
Like this.

12:18.728 --> 12:20.778
- Okay?
- Yeah.

13:07.360 --> 13:10.238
The color is still eluding me.

13:11.097 --> 13:13.222
Well, how do you feel...

13:13.769 --> 13:15.121
about green?

13:15.910 --> 13:18.002
I'm not raising a bear cub, Mr. Dalton.

13:19.255 --> 13:20.955
I went to the ocean once.

13:21.007 --> 13:22.340
Not the docks... the beach.

13:22.375 --> 13:24.292
- Of course.
- I remember thinking

13:24.344 --> 13:27.036
that the water looked so...

13:28.316 --> 13:29.412
blue.

13:33.937 --> 13:35.269
Ernestine?

13:35.305 --> 13:36.453
Yes, ma'am?

13:38.555 --> 13:40.308
Exceptional choice.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.193
How long will it take?

13:42.228 --> 13:44.145
Well, no more than six weeks.

13:44.197 --> 13:46.197
Do I look like I have six weeks?

13:46.684 --> 13:48.575
Well, ma'am, this is
special order fabric.

13:48.918 --> 13:50.151
It will need to travel by post

13:50.153 --> 13:52.524
all the way up north to Boston.

13:53.206 --> 13:54.822
Pardon me, Miss Suzanna,

13:54.824 --> 13:56.887
but wouldn't by train be quicker?

14:00.663 --> 14:02.006
Well?

14:03.633 --> 14:05.833
There's a train leaving
Atlanta tomorrow afternoon.

14:05.885 --> 14:08.169
I suppose if we got the order on there,

14:08.171 --> 14:10.494
we can have the shipment by week's end.

14:11.134 --> 14:12.840
That's all I wanted to hear.

14:12.842 --> 14:15.309
Stine, you may show Mr. Dalton out now.

14:15.345 --> 14:17.261
He's got a train to catch.

14:36.499 --> 14:39.534
It's 110 proof, but drinking it

14:39.586 --> 14:40.868
you wouldn't know.

14:41.304 --> 14:42.370
You understand what "proof" means?

14:42.422 --> 14:44.505
I can't say I do, sir.

14:44.541 --> 14:46.105
In the 16th century,

14:46.130 --> 14:48.718
payments to British sailors
included rations of rum.

14:48.770 --> 14:50.078
To ensure the rum

14:50.130 --> 14:51.762
had not been watered down,
it was "proved"

14:51.798 --> 14:54.181
by testing to see
if the alcohol would ignite.

14:54.217 --> 14:55.428
If it did not...

14:57.020 --> 14:59.720
the rum contained too much water
and was considered to be

14:59.772 --> 15:00.868
"under proof."

15:01.057 --> 15:04.275
So, uh... 110 is high? For gin?

15:04.728 --> 15:06.060
You tell me.

15:09.945 --> 15:12.033
Are you sure this is okay, Massa?

15:12.068 --> 15:13.484
Can't toast without a drink.

15:13.536 --> 15:14.702
Well, it don't seem...

15:14.737 --> 15:16.704
much a day for celebration.

15:16.739 --> 15:18.591
Those other two are
gonna be back soon enough.

15:18.992 --> 15:21.075
You know who won't? Bill.

15:21.696 --> 15:22.694
Hell, you saw him.

15:24.327 --> 15:26.414
You've worked for me for what,
eight years now?

15:26.466 --> 15:28.325
Uh, 11, sir.

15:30.469 --> 15:32.670
You warned me about Noah,
and I didn't listen.

15:32.722 --> 15:35.423
You got the heart of this
plantation in a tight grip,

15:35.475 --> 15:38.225
and that's what I need
in my new overseer.

15:44.202 --> 15:46.267
This whole ordeal is gonna put ideas

15:46.269 --> 15:48.821
in the others' heads...
I need you to drive them out,

15:48.857 --> 15:50.021
you understand?

15:51.824 --> 15:53.207
You know what?

15:53.967 --> 15:55.526
You grab yourself a bottle.

15:55.578 --> 15:56.852
Any one you want.

15:57.196 --> 15:58.607
I know you're gonna earn it.

16:36.035 --> 16:38.486
This looked about your size.

16:55.856 --> 16:57.505
Rosalee, we ain't got much time.

16:58.247 --> 17:01.092
Can you help me with the... buttons?

17:31.264 --> 17:33.591
They found us.

17:59.068 --> 18:00.486
This the good wine?

18:00.987 --> 18:02.653
Actually, it's my favorite.

18:02.705 --> 18:04.121
Keep your eyes off me!

18:04.146 --> 18:05.790
Slaves don't look
their massa in the eye.

18:05.825 --> 18:07.907
And get over there...
you're disturbing my meal.

18:10.530 --> 18:12.747
Is that really necessary?

18:15.780 --> 18:16.884
Wash over here,

18:16.919 --> 18:18.698
he always been like a caged bird.

18:20.162 --> 18:22.723
Always singin' when the white
folks want to hear a tune.

18:25.969 --> 18:27.762
Try putting me into a cage
like a animal,

18:27.764 --> 18:30.231
you gonna find I got claws and teeth.

18:37.323 --> 18:39.106
Pick that up.

18:39.108 --> 18:40.941
Come on.

18:45.782 --> 18:47.698
Me and Wash...

18:48.584 --> 18:51.452
we been friends
for a long, long time, huh?

18:52.146 --> 18:53.931
So if he think you're innocent...

18:56.959 --> 18:58.430
...I'll hear you out.

19:03.742 --> 19:05.549
What is it that you do?

19:06.469 --> 19:07.823
I'm a lawyer.

19:09.102 --> 19:10.054
Did you ever own

19:10.106 --> 19:12.970
- any slaves?
- No, sir. I would never.

19:13.022 --> 19:14.988
Under any circumstances.

19:16.445 --> 19:18.979
Where was you nine summers ago?

19:26.038 --> 19:27.675
I'd just finished law school.

19:28.891 --> 19:30.207
I was clerking for Justice Corbin

19:30.243 --> 19:32.126
over in Pennsylvania...
he was a district judge.

19:32.161 --> 19:34.829
- He's just saying words.
- No, no, it's true.

19:36.716 --> 19:38.582
I feel for your plight,

19:38.634 --> 19:40.467
I do.

19:40.503 --> 19:42.169
And I understand... why you...

19:42.221 --> 19:44.755
You don't understand nothing!

19:44.807 --> 19:46.590
How you possibly gonna understand

19:46.642 --> 19:48.559
the pain that I've been through, huh?

19:48.594 --> 19:49.810
Hmm? The way I felt

19:49.846 --> 19:51.478
when you took Tempie from me.

19:51.514 --> 19:53.514
That was my wife.
She was mine, not yours!

19:55.234 --> 19:57.017
I'm gonna show 'em
what happens to slaves

19:57.019 --> 19:58.686
when they lie to their massas.

19:59.728 --> 20:01.438
Welcome to the new order of things.

20:01.490 --> 20:03.524
Ain't none of y'all gonna be
runnin' like those troublemakers.

20:03.526 --> 20:05.560
Yo' ass is gonna be too tired.

20:05.595 --> 20:07.528
Now, y'all picked 3,000 pounds
under Bill.

20:07.878 --> 20:09.261
I aim to double that.

20:11.620 --> 20:12.666
Hey, boss.

20:13.586 --> 20:14.869
You got a leak there.

20:14.921 --> 20:16.203
What'd you say to me?

20:16.918 --> 20:18.532
Your canteen done caught a leak.

20:19.395 --> 20:21.592
Mind your own work, boy.

20:22.211 --> 20:24.511
I want y'all breakin' the scale
with your pickings.

20:24.547 --> 20:27.214
And until you are,
ain't no more water breaks!

20:29.427 --> 20:31.242
Now, get these buckets out of my sight.

20:33.389 --> 20:35.379
You get in there?

20:35.431 --> 20:36.724
They're gone, Mama.

20:37.381 --> 20:38.142
Cato must have 'em.

20:38.194 --> 20:39.310
No, no, no, no,

20:39.362 --> 20:40.644
she-she just missed 'em.

20:40.696 --> 20:41.946
He in charge now.

20:42.475 --> 20:45.316
Only one allowed back in the
quarters during the workday.

20:45.955 --> 20:48.235
Them papers got all our names on 'em.

20:48.237 --> 20:49.820
Well, I'll find 'em tonight
and I'll burn 'em.

20:50.708 --> 20:53.240
We got to go before Cato got
a chance to use 'em against us.

20:54.181 --> 20:55.576
You think we should still run?

20:55.628 --> 20:57.156
We ain't gonna get
another chance at this.

20:57.181 --> 20:59.113
And maybe that's God's will.

20:59.148 --> 21:00.414
Maybe this-this thing with Noah

21:00.416 --> 21:02.216
is a sign it wasn't meant to be.

21:02.251 --> 21:04.329
God don't give us signs,
he gives us strength.

21:05.653 --> 21:06.917
There's too much risk, Ma.

21:06.969 --> 21:08.222
You done said it. You gonna carry

21:08.257 --> 21:09.423
our little girl to freedom.

21:09.425 --> 21:11.257
Ain't no risk too much for that.

21:49.462 --> 21:51.335
I'm sorry, Noah.

21:51.955 --> 21:54.455
I ain't mean to mess up your plan.

21:54.851 --> 21:56.580
I thought the swamp
would mask our scent,

21:56.615 --> 21:58.502
but them dogs still on us.

22:00.340 --> 22:02.523
I want you to keep going...

22:02.559 --> 22:03.831
that way, towards the mountains.

22:04.227 --> 22:05.643
You said you ain't gone leave me.

22:05.695 --> 22:07.312
- Go. I'm gonna catch up.
- No, no.

22:07.364 --> 22:09.237
- I-I can't go by myself.
- Ain't no can't any more.

22:09.604 --> 22:12.405
You have to. Now you put
a bottle in the overseer's neck,

22:12.440 --> 22:14.225
you got out of that cabin by yourself.

22:14.260 --> 22:15.512
You can do this, too.

22:24.336 --> 22:26.703
What the hell are you doin'?
I said you got to go.

22:27.087 --> 22:29.380
Mama says to never pick
these for the house.

22:30.435 --> 22:33.377
Go get me one of them water birds.

23:00.406 --> 23:03.874
Mr. Pullman, sorry about the wait.

23:05.044 --> 23:06.877
Please have a seat.

23:06.912 --> 23:08.578
And who is this?

23:10.632 --> 23:12.632
That'd be my son Ben.

23:12.668 --> 23:13.717
How old are you, Ben?

23:13.752 --> 23:15.168
- 11 years, sir.
- My boy T.R....

23:15.220 --> 23:17.337
he's eight. Three more,
and he'll a be a young man,

23:17.389 --> 23:18.839
I guess.

23:18.891 --> 23:20.734
Can I interest you in a cigar?

23:21.191 --> 23:22.009
If it's all the same,

23:22.011 --> 23:24.511
I'd like to hear more detail
about your runaways.

23:26.812 --> 23:28.982
One is one of my house girls.

23:29.413 --> 23:30.817
Lived her entire life
behind these very walls.

23:30.853 --> 23:32.352
About as delicate as them flowers

23:32.404 --> 23:33.687
you passed on the way in.

23:33.739 --> 23:35.439
I can't imagine
she'd last long out there.

23:35.744 --> 23:37.240
And the boy... well, he just recently

23:37.276 --> 23:39.192
became a bit of a troublemaker. Please.

23:40.057 --> 23:41.695
You came highly recommended,

23:41.697 --> 23:44.197
from Greer Page at First Presbyterian,

23:44.199 --> 23:45.615
for your skills

23:45.667 --> 23:47.571
as much as your discretion.

23:48.203 --> 23:50.454
It's the latter I'm most interested in.

23:52.473 --> 23:53.822
How does this work cash-wise?

23:53.874 --> 23:55.291
I've never had a runaway before.

23:55.326 --> 23:57.876
I ask for half up front,
and the rest, plus expenses,

23:57.912 --> 23:59.745
when I bring your property back to you.

23:59.797 --> 24:01.080
Half?

24:01.937 --> 24:04.177
How do I know you won't just
run off with my money?

24:07.106 --> 24:08.554
- I ain't no cheat.
- Hmm.

24:14.138 --> 24:15.594
Sorry.

24:16.398 --> 24:18.430
You can take that out of my pay.

24:18.465 --> 24:20.778
Oh, don't worry about it.
I got five more just like it.

24:21.053 --> 24:21.934
And I've got

24:21.986 --> 24:24.069
ten paddy rollers scouring
the surrounding acres.

24:24.105 --> 24:26.138
I mean, from what I hear,
most runners...

24:26.173 --> 24:28.324
they don't get far.
They lurk, and they fret,

24:28.359 --> 24:30.442
and then they return.

24:31.483 --> 24:32.805
So why should I hire you?

24:34.663 --> 24:36.054
Did your rollers tell you
how they managed

24:36.090 --> 24:37.133
to get off your plantation?

24:37.732 --> 24:38.500
They don't have a clue.

24:38.536 --> 24:40.134
It's been vexing me all day.

24:40.504 --> 24:43.122
I saw some carriage tracks
when I came on.

24:43.174 --> 24:44.957
Did any wagons leave from last night?

24:45.541 --> 24:47.259
Yes, one, pushing on midnight.

24:47.295 --> 24:48.967
You wager that's how they got off?

24:49.744 --> 24:51.964
I don't like to wager, Mr. Macon.

24:52.933 --> 24:54.300
I'll tell you what.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.936
If my paddy rollers haven't
retrieved them by nightfall,

24:58.806 --> 25:00.351
consider yourself hired.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.359
I thought you said we were coming here

25:03.394 --> 25:04.888
'cause we had the job.

25:05.313 --> 25:06.872
I'm gonna have the job.

25:07.398 --> 25:09.698
What are we supposed
to do until nightfall?

25:11.235 --> 25:13.334
You're gonna wait with the horses.

25:13.466 --> 25:14.485
Yes, sir.

25:14.537 --> 25:15.885
And don't touch nothin'.

25:20.544 --> 25:22.168
I can see the dogs.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.132
They're comin'.

25:27.168 --> 25:29.234
I just need a second,
get these flowers in.

25:31.222 --> 25:32.671
We ain't got no more seconds.

25:41.515 --> 25:44.850
You do this, you gonna be
exactly what they think...

25:44.852 --> 25:46.402
a wild animal.

25:46.437 --> 25:47.936
Listen to me!

25:47.988 --> 25:49.938
You got to let Tempie go.

25:49.990 --> 25:51.240
Wasn't your fault.

25:51.275 --> 25:52.879
Ain't nothin' you could have done.

25:53.327 --> 25:54.610
I'm doin' somethin' now.

25:54.662 --> 25:56.362
I am begging you.

25:56.414 --> 25:57.696
Please don't do this.

25:57.698 --> 26:00.115
I ain't doin' nothin'. You is.

26:05.256 --> 26:06.872
This done gone too far.

26:07.897 --> 26:10.881
You really gonna choose
these white folks over me? Huh?

26:13.249 --> 26:14.713
I'm sorry.

26:21.389 --> 26:22.554
Pick it up.

26:22.606 --> 26:23.889
I can't.

26:23.941 --> 26:25.724
- Don't you touch her!
- I said pick it up!

26:28.248 --> 26:29.728
I will not.

26:30.564 --> 26:31.730
Your ass is next then.

26:31.732 --> 26:32.865
All right. All right,
all right, all right!

26:32.900 --> 26:34.283
All right, Elizabeth, it's okay.

26:34.318 --> 26:35.622
Just do it.

26:37.500 --> 26:38.654
I'll be fine.

26:38.706 --> 26:41.573
John.

26:44.201 --> 26:45.463
You heard your man.

26:48.165 --> 26:51.133
Do it. Do it!

26:54.588 --> 26:55.850
Now!

27:00.094 --> 27:01.427
Again.

27:05.182 --> 27:06.265
Tell me the truth.

27:06.317 --> 27:07.433
Tell me you sold her.

27:12.106 --> 27:13.155
Harder.

27:17.328 --> 27:19.445
Harder!

27:20.448 --> 27:22.448
Again!

27:25.002 --> 27:26.418
Please, no more.

27:27.788 --> 27:29.922
Told you what would
happen if you didn't...

27:29.957 --> 27:32.958
Stop! You were right.
It was me! It was me.

27:32.960 --> 27:34.710
I'll tell you the truth.

27:38.466 --> 27:39.965
Everything.

27:45.523 --> 27:47.189
Son of a bitch!

27:47.224 --> 27:48.474
They poisoned 'em.

27:50.060 --> 27:53.312
Well, how the hell
we gonna track 'em down?

27:59.562 --> 28:01.119
We ought to keep movin'.

28:14.515 --> 28:15.881
Can I help you, sir?

28:15.917 --> 28:17.428
If you clip the tendon right off,

28:17.464 --> 28:19.498
you can separate the meat
from the bone clean.

28:21.474 --> 28:23.509
And not have so much gristle.

28:25.095 --> 28:27.763
May I?

28:33.020 --> 28:35.854
One of the runaways...
she's your daughter?

28:36.670 --> 28:37.894
She is.

28:38.492 --> 28:41.109
You got, uh, two other boys?

28:41.710 --> 28:43.622
One's a little younger than your son.

28:46.463 --> 28:47.749
Your husband... where he at?

28:48.846 --> 28:50.035
He passed away.

28:50.037 --> 28:52.142
Before your daughter was born?

28:55.292 --> 28:58.126
Most slave families find
it hard to stay together.

28:58.178 --> 29:00.546
Half the runners I chase down...

29:00.548 --> 29:02.848
they're just tryin' to get back

29:02.883 --> 29:05.217
to their wife, children.

29:05.269 --> 29:07.390
But your daughter...

29:08.694 --> 29:10.389
all her family's right here.

29:12.109 --> 29:13.622
Why do you think she ran?

29:15.302 --> 29:17.229
I was always tough on her.

29:17.663 --> 29:19.231
Wanted to prepare her for the way

29:19.233 --> 29:21.450
the world chews up our kind
and spits us out.

29:24.598 --> 29:26.238
But I fear I may have done
more harm than good,

29:26.240 --> 29:27.823
that maybe I pushed her away.

29:30.302 --> 29:31.910
She's just a simple girl.

29:31.962 --> 29:34.580
Can't imagine she make
any trouble she caught.

29:38.636 --> 29:41.086
I just been down at the overseer's.

29:43.724 --> 29:45.924
I seen what kind of trouble Rosalee is.

30:02.781 --> 30:04.147
Tempie.

30:05.818 --> 30:07.317
It was short for Temperance.

30:07.319 --> 30:10.004
That's right. Her mama named her
after where she was born.

30:10.056 --> 30:11.101
I didn't remember

30:11.103 --> 30:12.990
until now 'cause it was one
of my first cases at the firm.

30:14.066 --> 30:17.411
I was sent to Virginia to
handle an estate sale.

30:17.463 --> 30:19.796
I supervised the distribution of assets.

30:19.832 --> 30:22.082
Stop with all the fancy talk
and just say it plain.

30:22.134 --> 30:25.052
The property. I separated the
slaves that had been bequeathed.

30:25.087 --> 30:27.387
Given away in your owner's will.

30:27.423 --> 30:30.173
I called out names, pointed to
wagons, and they were loaded up.

30:30.175 --> 30:33.677
But I can see now how
that must have seemed to you.

30:33.679 --> 30:36.013
Like I was the slaver.

30:38.517 --> 30:39.839
But you were right.

30:41.031 --> 30:42.446
That was me.

30:48.694 --> 30:52.662
I want to know what happened
to her after they took her.

30:53.366 --> 30:56.199
And don't you say
that you don't remember.

30:56.751 --> 31:00.337
Your wife was taken... by a man

31:00.372 --> 31:02.039
that your owner owed a debt to. Where?

31:02.430 --> 31:03.707
Kentucky.

31:11.717 --> 31:14.468
I, um... I had to travel with them.

31:15.637 --> 31:17.521
- You saw where they took her?
- I did.

31:17.556 --> 31:19.306
I stayed some days on business,

31:20.043 --> 31:21.308
and the man that she was sold to,

31:21.360 --> 31:23.226
- from what I observed...
- What was his name?

31:23.228 --> 31:26.279
Todd Rogers, and he
owned a moderately-sized

31:26.315 --> 31:27.697
tobacco plantation.

31:29.234 --> 31:30.400
Tobacco ain't

31:30.402 --> 31:32.702
as backbreaking as pickin' cotton.

31:32.738 --> 31:34.788
That's right. That's right.

31:34.823 --> 31:37.207
Uh, did she say anything?

31:37.242 --> 31:39.409
Did she say anything at all? Please?

31:39.411 --> 31:42.129
Not to me. She stayed
in the back of the wagon

31:42.164 --> 31:43.830
most of the trip, just...

31:43.882 --> 31:46.210
wrapped in a blanket,
trying to keep warm.

31:51.423 --> 31:53.124
Trying to stay warm?

31:56.386 --> 31:58.562
My wife was taken in summer.

32:00.599 --> 32:02.566
What?

32:02.601 --> 32:06.820
You just gonna say
what you think I want to hear?

32:06.855 --> 32:09.106
- No, that's the truth.
- You ain't never gonna tell the truth.

32:09.158 --> 32:11.274
It's just one lie after lie

32:11.326 --> 32:12.609
- after lie after lie.
- No, that's the truth.

32:12.611 --> 32:14.111
Lie after lie after lie after lie

32:14.113 --> 32:15.362
after lie...

32:15.825 --> 32:17.665
That's all y'all do is lie.

32:22.087 --> 32:24.504
Now I got to cut your lyin' tongue out.

32:36.268 --> 32:37.634
I'm sorry.

32:37.686 --> 32:40.137
I shouldn't have never left.
Y'all are good f...

32:52.869 --> 32:54.351
I seen death,

32:54.353 --> 32:57.154
but the moss stay the same, and...

32:57.156 --> 32:59.873
It's talking about moss growing
on the north side of the trees.

32:59.908 --> 33:01.908
Now, I-I don't know what the blue haze

33:01.960 --> 33:04.127
or-or the wolf is, but I-I thought

33:04.163 --> 33:05.745
I had more time to figure that out.

33:05.797 --> 33:08.331
But-But the river is the Ohio one,

33:08.383 --> 33:09.464
you got that?

33:09.489 --> 33:10.967
Why is it so important
you teach me this now?

33:11.003 --> 33:12.586
You says we gots to keep moving.

33:13.755 --> 33:15.338
I'm going back.

33:17.176 --> 33:18.470
For the others.

33:20.846 --> 33:23.180
Rose, I-I-I was Henry's age

33:23.634 --> 33:25.398
the first time I heard my old massa

33:25.434 --> 33:26.817
talking 'bout free black folks.

33:27.853 --> 33:30.418
Up in Illinois, they
just walking around.

33:30.939 --> 33:32.856
It lit a fire in me.

33:33.372 --> 33:35.017
I knew I was supposed to be free.

33:36.068 --> 33:37.967
I started acting like it, too.

33:38.614 --> 33:41.665
I got my back tore up
real good for my dreaming.

33:42.428 --> 33:44.701
Eventually, I...

33:44.703 --> 33:46.651
I-I just started playing by the rules.

33:47.491 --> 33:48.705
By the time I got to Macon,

33:48.757 --> 33:50.423
I'd been playing the good slave so long,

33:50.459 --> 33:52.375
I-I forgot it was an act.

33:53.339 --> 33:55.462
I settled right into a life

33:55.514 --> 33:58.988
of hard work and-and moderate
liberties at the shop.

33:59.860 --> 34:01.868
Till I met Henry.

34:02.221 --> 34:04.471
Oh, he was so full of fire.

34:04.523 --> 34:07.724
He... he reminded me of-of-of...

34:07.776 --> 34:09.559
of that thing that I lost.

34:09.561 --> 34:11.777
That hope for something better.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.231
He the one sparked all this.

34:14.233 --> 34:15.876
I-I-I can't le...

34:16.618 --> 34:19.402
I won't leave him behind.

34:19.454 --> 34:22.270
I won't leave any of them behind.

34:23.844 --> 34:24.991
Now, if I don't come back,

34:25.043 --> 34:27.244
I need you to promise me
you won't go to the...

34:41.476 --> 34:44.060
You'll come back.

34:58.277 --> 34:59.826
I need to talk to you.

35:01.113 --> 35:03.363
Now, I know I must be
coming up in the world

35:03.415 --> 35:05.031
if the head house bitch wants to chat.

35:05.083 --> 35:07.033
I know you was planning to run.

35:10.455 --> 35:12.789
Sonny boy doesn't know
how to keep his mouth shut.

35:12.841 --> 35:13.957
Seems like your whole family

35:14.009 --> 35:15.458
got a reckless streak.

35:15.460 --> 35:17.794
I heard there's a train leaving
north from Atlanta tomorrow.

35:17.796 --> 35:19.296
What you telling me for?

35:19.348 --> 35:21.298
Seems to me you had
bigger plans for yourself

35:21.350 --> 35:23.016
than being Mr. Bill's replacement.

35:23.640 --> 35:24.934
If that's true,

35:24.970 --> 35:27.637
and your path crosses with my daughter,

35:27.639 --> 35:30.273
I just ask that you do what you can

35:30.309 --> 35:32.309
to get her on that train.

35:34.730 --> 35:36.946
Funny thing about plans...

35:36.982 --> 35:39.400
they always changing.

35:51.880 --> 35:55.165
I know y'all was planning to run
with that Noah.

35:56.968 --> 35:58.051
Now, I just don't know

35:58.086 --> 36:00.303
if you still thinking about it.

36:01.890 --> 36:04.341
Let me tell y'all
a cautionary tale about a slave

36:04.393 --> 36:06.681
who tried to run.

36:07.813 --> 36:10.263
Thought he was smart.
But the first time,

36:10.315 --> 36:12.265
he didn't break a sweat
when they dragged him back,

36:12.317 --> 36:14.529
burned that R into his flesh.

36:15.020 --> 36:17.153
But some folks don't never learn.

36:18.990 --> 36:21.741
That night the boy ran again.
Two days later,

36:21.777 --> 36:24.077
his ass dragged back.

36:24.112 --> 36:25.829
So they held him down,

36:25.864 --> 36:28.553
burned another R,
right next to the other.

36:28.750 --> 36:32.035
That boy couldn't stand
his own reflection after that.

36:33.205 --> 36:35.422
A man who never sees his own reflection.

36:35.457 --> 36:38.208
Hell, he starts to forget he's a man

36:38.210 --> 36:39.161
at all.

36:40.212 --> 36:43.179
That boy made a promise
if he ever did it again,

36:43.215 --> 36:45.632
he wouldn't hesitate... not a moment.

36:46.685 --> 36:48.301
He'd learned it so good,

36:48.353 --> 36:50.053
he didn't hesitate when he burned

36:50.105 --> 36:53.266
half his face off
to get rid of them R's.

36:58.814 --> 36:59.946
Aah!

37:08.657 --> 37:10.540
Run!

37:17.375 --> 37:19.709
We need water here, now!

37:19.761 --> 37:21.294
Get all the slaves out here!

37:21.346 --> 37:23.880
Go, move! Get moving!

37:23.882 --> 37:26.099
Get water.

37:26.134 --> 37:27.267
Pick those buckets up.

37:27.302 --> 37:30.219
Get all the slaves! Go!

37:30.272 --> 37:32.889
Get water! Now!

37:32.891 --> 37:34.357
What are you waiting for?

37:34.392 --> 37:35.608
This wasn't no accident.

37:35.644 --> 37:37.644
What the hell you talking about?

37:39.064 --> 37:40.480
You got more runners.

37:41.650 --> 37:44.067
We saw the fire, came to help.

37:44.069 --> 37:46.653
- Came from where?
- The bridge.

37:48.073 --> 37:49.739
The fire's a distraction.
That's where they're headed.

37:51.076 --> 37:52.742
I'll get you your money,

37:52.744 --> 37:54.377
you just get 'em.

37:54.412 --> 37:55.545
Ben! Get the horses.

37:55.580 --> 37:57.246
Meet me at the bridge!

37:58.333 --> 38:01.815
Hurry on up...!

38:23.256 --> 38:25.790
Ow! Papa!

38:34.301 --> 38:36.100
Do whatever it takes

38:36.136 --> 38:37.552
to get her free!

38:37.604 --> 38:39.220
Don't shoot!

38:47.113 --> 38:48.363
Please...

38:48.398 --> 38:50.815
not in front of my daughter.

39:15.475 --> 39:16.674
They wanted money.

39:16.726 --> 39:18.476
Told 'em we didn't have any;
we keep it at the bank.

39:18.511 --> 39:20.228
They thought we were lying.

39:20.263 --> 39:21.729
And that's what happened to your...

39:21.765 --> 39:24.315
Tried to get me to tell... the truth.

39:24.351 --> 39:25.817
I thought it was suspicious

39:25.852 --> 39:28.236
when I saw that Negro slip
around the side of your home.

39:28.271 --> 39:30.655
Glad I decided to circle back around.

39:30.690 --> 39:33.191
So are we. Thank you, again, Marshal.

39:33.243 --> 39:34.659
If you got what you need,

39:34.694 --> 39:36.694
I'd like to check on my wife.

39:36.746 --> 39:38.830
Yeah.

39:58.852 --> 40:00.301
Your story...

40:00.353 --> 40:02.603
the part about the estate sale...

40:03.180 --> 40:04.744
was true, wasn't it?

40:06.192 --> 40:07.642
The worst day of that man's life

40:07.644 --> 40:09.861
was just another Tuesday
at the office for me.

40:14.367 --> 40:16.117
I just... I was
so concerned about making

40:16.152 --> 40:18.705
a good impression my first year
at the firm that I didn't...

40:19.945 --> 40:22.065
think twice about what I was doing.

40:24.911 --> 40:27.128
Then you got the whipping you deserved.

40:29.666 --> 40:31.582
You made a mistake.

40:31.634 --> 40:35.420
But God has given us
the opportunity to fix that now.

41:10.790 --> 41:12.039
Hold it right there, boy!

41:12.091 --> 41:13.040
No, no. No, no, no!

41:13.042 --> 41:14.342
No, no.

42:31.671 --> 42:33.788
Where Pearly Mae?

42:45.885 --> 42:47.852
My brother?

42:47.887 --> 42:48.936
Come on down!

42:48.972 --> 42:50.271
Keep it coming!

42:50.306 --> 42:52.974
We need more water!

42:52.976 --> 42:54.892
Get that pail up here!

42:56.479 --> 42:57.895
That's it, let's get some more!

43:00.199 --> 43:02.867
- Is Virgil here?
- Right here!

43:02.902 --> 43:06.153
Get some more from the house!

43:06.155 --> 43:08.322
Go!

43:08.324 --> 43:10.791
Come on, hurry up!
