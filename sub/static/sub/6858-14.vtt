00:17.726 --> 00:19.435
ANNOUNCER: Mysterious deaths!

00:19.769 --> 00:21.103
Unknown to the Jedi,

00:21.187 --> 00:23.897
a new threat has been unleashed
on the galaxy,

00:24.065 --> 00:27.276
Savage Opress,
a pawn in the dangerous game

00:27.360 --> 00:30.571
between Count Dooku
and his former assassin, Ventress.

00:30.905 --> 00:33.949
The victims of his brutal massacre
on the planet of Devaron

00:34.117 --> 00:37.536
are being returned to the Jedi Temple
for evaluation.

00:37.620 --> 00:41.457
It's up to the Jedi Council
to find this mysterious killer

00:41.583 --> 00:43.292
and eradicate him.

00:57.974 --> 01:01.310
There were no survivors on Devaron.
Everyone was killed,

01:01.436 --> 01:03.312
including Master Halsey and his Padawan.

01:03.938 --> 01:08.484
In the past, only Dooku's assassin
was capable of such an effort.

01:09.235 --> 01:12.071
But she was presumed dead
at the battle of Sullust.

01:12.489 --> 01:17.284
Not everything is what it seems.
There may be a new threat.

01:17.494 --> 01:20.496
Someone or something has eluded us,

01:20.747 --> 01:23.999
perhaps a newly appointed Sith Lord.

01:24.334 --> 01:27.920
This is not the work of a Sith Lord
or a Jedi,

01:28.004 --> 01:30.339
but a reckless, impulsive animal.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.072
(GROANS)

01:55.615 --> 01:58.033
You have no technique.

01:58.743 --> 01:59.743
(GRUNTS)

02:04.624 --> 02:05.666
Sloppy.

02:05.959 --> 02:06.959
(GRUNTS)

02:11.673 --> 02:14.883
But with the proper training,
you could be a powerful warrior.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.221
You have a natural ability,
but we must hone it.

02:19.806 --> 02:23.267
Are you up for the challenge
of putting your hate to better use?

02:23.726 --> 02:25.185
Yes, Master.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.067
Master Yoda, you called for me?

02:32.610 --> 02:36.572
Master Kenobi.
Show you something we must.

02:37.157 --> 02:41.285
We have recovered surveillance footage
of the massacre on Devaron.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.498
Darth Maul alive?

02:47.167 --> 02:49.626
It can't be! I killed him myself!

02:50.336 --> 02:52.296
Correct you are, Obi-Wan.

02:52.547 --> 02:55.883
A creature of the same species he is,
from Dathomir.

02:56.342 --> 02:59.094
Dathomir? The planet of the witches?

02:59.929 --> 03:03.015
I was under the impression that
Darth Maul's home world was Iridonia.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.559
Dathomir is the planet
where Maul was raised.

03:06.269 --> 03:09.146
Iridonia is where the rest of the males
of the species dwell.

03:09.939 --> 03:12.649
Travel to Dathomir you must.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.652
Find the source of this threat you will.

03:19.949 --> 03:24.745
You must strengthen your connection
with the Force, my apprentice.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.623
Feel its power within you.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.683
Now, lift them.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.315
Concentrate!

04:03.117 --> 04:05.244
What you ask is impossible!

04:06.120 --> 04:07.371
Impossible?

04:08.456 --> 04:12.709
The task is only impossible
because you have deemed it so!

04:13.461 --> 04:16.088
You must connect with your hatred!

04:16.547 --> 04:17.547
(SCREAMING)

04:18.424 --> 04:21.510
Focus on your power building.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.514
Do not think of anyone or anything else.

04:26.057 --> 04:29.184
(SCREAMING)

04:30.645 --> 04:31.728
That's it!

04:32.647 --> 04:35.190
Your anger is your strength!

04:36.693 --> 04:38.735
I hate you!

04:38.987 --> 04:40.362
Good.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.866
(GROANING)

04:53.835 --> 04:57.087
How does one defend against such power?

04:57.672 --> 05:02.801
A wise master does not reveal
all his secrets at once.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.513
In due time, my apprentice.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.107
There's the village.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.369
Be on guard.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.664
These men are ferocious warriors
and they will show no mercy.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.751
Don't worry! I won't start anything.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.299
Let me handle the negotiations.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.927
(EXCLAIMING)

05:54.437 --> 05:56.438
So much for not starting something.

05:56.522 --> 05:57.898
Hey, don't look at me!

06:00.777 --> 06:01.860
Don't harm them.

06:02.111 --> 06:04.321
Don't tell me, tell them!

06:12.330 --> 06:13.413
Back off!

06:17.335 --> 06:19.002
We are not here to fight you!

06:19.670 --> 06:21.171
We're here for information.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.133
A man from your village
murdered two Jedi.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.302
We need to know where he is.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.055
What makes you think he's one of ours?

06:30.390 --> 06:32.808
The Jedi Council knows
he's from this village.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.476
We have seen him.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.064
Mother Talzin should know
of his whereabouts.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.483
One of her women took him as a mate.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.736
I apologize for the intrusion, then.

06:44.946 --> 06:47.364
Anakin, kindly release him, please.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.083
Stop!

06:58.418 --> 06:59.501
Let them go.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.421
Who is this Mother Talzin?

07:02.755 --> 07:06.800
She's the leader of an ancient
order of witches, the Nightsisters.

07:07.051 --> 07:09.970
Great. Warrior-like men, witches.

07:10.179 --> 07:12.013
This place is all kinds of fun.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.640
I'm glad you think so.

07:28.239 --> 07:31.366
You have completed
the first stages of your training

07:31.534 --> 07:34.828
and I am sending you
on an assignment to Toydaria.

07:35.746 --> 07:39.749
You will bring me King Katuunko, alive.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.420
Kill all who might interfere.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.798
Yes, my master. It will be done.

08:01.689 --> 08:06.151
I don't know much of Mother Talzin,
but I don't expect to be welcome here.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.821
You never know.
I tend to be popular with the ladies.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.031
OBI-WAN: Too popular.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.254
We've got company.

08:39.810 --> 08:42.812
Jedi, come with us.

08:58.412 --> 09:00.372
Master Kenobi.

09:00.748 --> 09:04.376
Mother Talzin,
thank you for your hospitality.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.629
I believe you have a question for me.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.923
Yes, you're right.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.884
We've had reports of a Dathomiri male
on the loose.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.178
He's already killed two Jedi.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.264
Perhaps you know who he is?

09:17.557 --> 09:21.601
Master Jedi,
we have no control over the males.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.063
Our clan has been in exile for years.

09:25.481 --> 09:27.691
Don't play innocent with me, Mother.

09:28.359 --> 09:31.987
Everyone in the galaxy knows
females are dominant on this planet.

09:32.572 --> 09:36.157
I do not believe anything happens here
without your clan knowing about it.

09:36.534 --> 09:41.621
To think that the Jedi collect their facts
from mere rumors.

09:42.164 --> 09:45.542
Rumors? You call two dead Jedi rumors?

09:48.212 --> 09:52.007
This thing, this animal,
is extremely dangerous.

09:52.133 --> 09:56.094
If you have any information about
his whereabouts, you must tell us.

10:00.766 --> 10:04.769
Savage. Savage Opress.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.229
Mother?

10:06.314 --> 10:08.607
He is on Toydaria.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.358
Thank you.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.033
The time has come, sister.

10:18.534 --> 10:22.787
You must put your plot against Dooku
into effect now.

10:23.372 --> 10:26.207
He isn't ready, Mother.
He needs more training.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.418
He has to be ready.

10:29.211 --> 10:33.298
Together, the two of you
will be able to eliminate the Count.

10:33.924 --> 10:36.092
But you must act now.

10:36.469 --> 10:40.180
We cannot keep your new assassin
a secret forever.

10:40.556 --> 10:43.141
I will have my revenge.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.518
You will, sister.

10:46.103 --> 10:47.228
You will.

11:31.273 --> 11:33.566
Your Highness,
there is an intruder at the door!

11:33.693 --> 11:34.859
Stop him!

11:54.880 --> 11:57.298
I will not be intimidated.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.322
At last.

13:21.217 --> 13:25.178
-I guess that's what's left of our ship.
-We'll borrow one from the Toydarians.

13:56.043 --> 13:59.045
You ignorant beast!

13:59.338 --> 14:01.881
I told you I wanted him alive!

14:02.007 --> 14:04.175
(GROANING)

14:05.970 --> 14:06.970
(GASPING)

14:07.930 --> 14:10.181
Forgive me, my master.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.560
That is not the way of the dark side.

14:22.820 --> 14:27.532
-Ventress!
-That's no way to treat your apprentice.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.826
I should know.

14:30.369 --> 14:34.956
Savage, you can make amends
for your mistake

14:35.207 --> 14:37.542
by destroying this witch.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.210
(LAUGHS)

14:40.671 --> 14:44.382
I don't think that will be happening.
Will it, Savage?

14:45.009 --> 14:49.512
Remember where your true loyalties lie.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.473
With you, mistress.

14:58.480 --> 15:02.233
Look, a Separatist Dreadnaught.
The King's murderer must have fled there.

15:02.776 --> 15:06.112
Dooku sent his assassin to exact
his revenge on the Toydarians.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.822
We'll make him pay for it.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.502
Halt! You are now...

15:45.819 --> 15:47.820
Finish him! Now!

16:16.475 --> 16:20.103
Get up! We must defeat him!

16:20.646 --> 16:21.896
Get up!

16:25.234 --> 16:28.653
Kill him! Kill him, you fool!

16:34.660 --> 16:38.162
I can't. He's too powerful.

16:38.539 --> 16:43.042
Your weakness will not be my downfall.

16:43.252 --> 16:47.755
A failed apprentice
makes for a foolish master.

16:51.343 --> 16:52.343
(OPRESS GRUNTING)

16:53.387 --> 16:54.387
Savage, no!

17:23.000 --> 17:24.834
-We'll take him together.
-Right.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.130
(GROANING)

17:34.803 --> 17:37.138
Leaving so soon, Master?

17:37.765 --> 17:42.310
You are no match for me
without the aid of your monster.

17:42.561 --> 17:43.561
Hmm...

17:43.896 --> 17:45.688
That remains to be seen.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.565
As you wish.

18:15.636 --> 18:19.263
Time to end this once and for all.

18:31.860 --> 18:32.860
(ESCAPE POD POWERING UP)

18:43.956 --> 18:49.252
Commander. Savage Opress is a traitor.
Destroy him.

18:49.586 --> 18:50.753
Roger, roger.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.681
They're not after us!

19:04.017 --> 19:05.643
They're attacking that monster!

19:24.288 --> 19:26.122
You're not supposed to be here.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.917
No sense in hanging around here.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.419
My thoughts exactly.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.991
You have come home to us.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.710
I was betrayed by Ventress.
The Jedi are after me!

20:13.128 --> 20:15.880
I'm not nearly strong enough
to defeat them all!

20:16.381 --> 20:17.757
Calm yourself.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.884
You will be.

20:22.179 --> 20:25.723
I don't understand. Who will teach me?

20:25.807 --> 20:28.017
You have a brother.

20:28.518 --> 20:30.186
A brother?

20:30.646 --> 20:32.855
But all of my kin were killed!

20:33.315 --> 20:34.941
Not all of them.

20:35.901 --> 20:39.737
He lives in the Outer Rim, in exile.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.365
You will find him.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.994
He will teach you
everything you need to learn

20:47.162 --> 20:50.915
to become even more powerful.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.667
My brother.

20:52.751 --> 20:53.876
How?

20:54.544 --> 20:56.003
How will I find him?

20:56.380 --> 21:01.092
This talisman has been imbued
with the power of our clan.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.761
It will be your compass.

21:07.391 --> 21:12.561
You have an important destiny to fulfill,
Savage Opress.

21:13.563 --> 21:16.440
You and your brother.

21:17.401 --> 21:22.989
Go. You will know where to find him.

21:25.158 --> 21:27.159
I will return, Mother.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.249
