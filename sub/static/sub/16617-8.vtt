00:01.101 --> 00:02.935
<i>You're watching</i>
The Last Man on Earth.

00:02.937 --> 00:04.436
Yes!

00:04.438 --> 00:05.971
<i>Catch all-new episodes Sundays.</i>

00:05.973 --> 00:08.140
<i>And check out</i>

00:08.142 --> 00:09.708

Whoo!

00:09.710 --> 00:11.977
Brooklyn Nine-Nine
<i>and</i> Family Guy.

00:11.979 --> 00:14.546
-Can me and Ramon
go ride shirtless bikes?
-(sighs)

00:14.548 --> 00:15.748
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:18.451 --> 00:20.052
<i>Previously on</i>
The Last Man on Earth...
You are not okay,

00:20.054 --> 00:22.221
and I want to help you.
I don't need your help!

00:22.223 --> 00:24.323
I hate you!
You're a monster!

00:24.325 --> 00:26.625
God, I'm gonna have
to find a new hideout.

00:29.295 --> 00:32.364
This looks like a good place
for Mama's hideaway.

00:34.067 --> 00:35.567
Melissa-- she's gone.

00:35.569 --> 00:39.405
I'm in the elevator!
Please, please help me!

00:42.509 --> 00:44.309
TODD:
Oh, my God. It says good-bye.

00:44.311 --> 00:46.478
What do we do?
Hey, don't worry, T-Bone.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.147
I got this, huh?

00:48.149 --> 00:50.516
Okay, the note Melissa left
says "good-bye."

00:50.518 --> 00:53.018
Those are our clues.
"Good" and "bye."

00:53.020 --> 00:54.486
What do we know
about this message?

00:54.488 --> 00:56.255
Okay, "bye" means she's left.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.589
That's what you say
when you're leaving.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.225
"Good" means good.
She wishes us well.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.527
I don't think this is helping.

01:01.529 --> 01:04.163
This is not helping.
We got to be smarter about this.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.698
What do we know? What do we
know? What we do know? Okay.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.234
We know the note says
"good-bye," okay?

01:09.236 --> 01:10.669
We know she wrote it by hand.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.504
We're not dealing
with an amateur here.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.506
She's left places before.
She's good.

01:14.508 --> 01:15.741
Tandy, we're wasting time.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.109
Just saying we're wasting time

01:17.111 --> 01:18.610
is a waste of time
in itself, okay?

01:18.612 --> 01:20.112
But he does have a point.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.214
We know that the first
48 hours are crucial.

01:22.216 --> 01:25.350
We know that nobody is ever
found after the first 48 hours.

01:25.352 --> 01:27.519
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Maybe it stands for something!

01:27.521 --> 01:29.221
Maybe it stands for something!

01:29.223 --> 01:31.690
Yes. Okay, "good-bye."
"G" is for "gone."

01:31.692 --> 01:34.026
"O" is for "outside."
Another "O,"

01:34.028 --> 01:35.394
reaffirming
the previous "outside."

01:35.396 --> 01:37.729
"D" is for "duh,"
as in it's a no-brainer

01:37.731 --> 01:40.065
that she's outside.
"B" is for "bye."

01:40.067 --> 01:42.034
That's, uh, part of the word.
"Y" is for "yes,

01:42.036 --> 01:44.269
you're on the right track
with all the letters thus far."

01:44.271 --> 01:47.372
And "E," uh... E, E,

01:47.374 --> 01:48.407
E, E, uh,

01:48.409 --> 01:50.709
uh, uh, uh, "eagle."
Tandy,

01:50.711 --> 01:52.578
maybe we should just
crack this code on the road.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.046
Totally, Carol. Okay.

01:54.048 --> 01:55.380
Oh, my God, there she is!
Huh?

01:55.382 --> 01:57.082
Is what I want to hear
from someone

01:57.084 --> 01:59.151
within the next
47 hours and 50 minutes.

01:59.153 --> 02:01.053
Okay, let's jet.
Come on, go!

02:01.055 --> 02:03.122
We've wasted time.
Right, Tandy.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.235
(horn honking in distance)

02:20.073 --> 02:22.474
Carol, come on, let's go!

02:22.476 --> 02:24.610
Hey! Hey!

02:24.612 --> 02:26.578
Hey, I'm in here!

02:26.580 --> 02:28.480
What's going on, bud?
I don't know.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.250
She's, like, taking a dump
or something, gosh.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.252
Carol!

02:33.254 --> 02:35.120
Stupid frigging gun.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.189
Hey, hey!

02:41.294 --> 02:43.829
(honking in distance)

02:45.598 --> 02:47.633
All right, okay!

02:47.635 --> 02:51.170
I was just leaving a note for
Gail so she knows where we are.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.274
Help! Help.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.408
Come on.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.579
(siren chirps)

03:01.548 --> 03:04.616
(distant gunshots)

03:11.157 --> 03:12.424
TODD (on bullhorn):
Melissa.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.460
Melissa.

03:16.629 --> 03:18.630
Melissa.

03:20.233 --> 03:21.466
Hey, bud.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.702
We didn't see anything. You?

03:23.704 --> 03:26.205
No. Same here.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.372
I'm gonna head
towards Milpitas.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.807
You check out Saratoga.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.209
Let's call it for the night.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.344
Everyone's massively pooped.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.780
Nah. I'm not going back
till I find her, Tandy.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.683
(engine starts)
Hey, Todd.

03:37.685 --> 03:38.717
Yeah?

03:38.719 --> 03:40.786
Find her.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.256
Okay.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.659
Melissa.

03:48.661 --> 03:49.928
Melissa?

03:51.731 --> 03:53.799
GAIL:
Bunch of frigging turds.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.402
Course, I would have
found them by now.

04:03.876 --> 04:07.546
Well, you know
what they say, Gordon.

04:07.548 --> 04:10.983
If you want something done,
you got to do it yourself.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.689
All right, lawn chair,

04:17.691 --> 04:19.291
hope you've got
your affairs in order,

04:19.293 --> 04:20.692
'cause you're about
to meet your maker.

04:20.694 --> 04:24.429
Cause of death: Gail Klosterman.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.938
Okay.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.879
LEWIS:
<i>Okay, so we already</i>

04:40.881 --> 04:43.248
checked Sunnyvale.
ERICA: Yeah.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.616
And Campbell.
Yeah.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.884
And Los Gatos.

04:45.886 --> 04:49.288
Don't forget these areas.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.391
And then if we jump
on the freeway,

04:52.393 --> 04:53.959
we could maybe
get south.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.894
I don't know, maybe
she got that far

04:55.896 --> 04:58.964
if she stole a car
or something.
Okay.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.235
And this area
right here.

05:03.237 --> 05:05.237
Okay.

05:05.239 --> 05:08.240
You head this way, yeah,
and we'll just, like,

05:08.242 --> 05:09.675
look at these...

05:09.677 --> 05:11.810
And, um, I don't know,
maybe tomorrow,

05:11.812 --> 05:14.613
we just get on the freeway
in this area.

05:14.615 --> 05:17.482
And then, if we have time,
we come over here....

05:17.484 --> 05:19.351
TANDY:
Good morning, Vietnam.

05:19.353 --> 05:22.454
BOTH:
Hey, Tandy.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.923
Notice anything
different about me?

05:24.925 --> 05:27.526
You're wearing a dinosaur suit?

05:27.528 --> 05:29.928
No, I'm not.
Oh, no! Wha-Wha...

05:29.930 --> 05:32.764
Oh, good God,
have I turned into a dinosaur?

05:32.766 --> 05:36.868
No...!

05:36.870 --> 05:38.470
Oh,

05:38.472 --> 05:41.373
JK. No, I'm wearing
a dinosaur suit. Yeah.

05:41.375 --> 05:42.474
That's ridiculous.

05:42.476 --> 05:43.975
Oh, really, huh?

05:43.977 --> 05:45.811
Well, let me
ask you a question, Lewis.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.446
Uh, what were you
wearing last night

05:47.448 --> 05:48.847
when you were
searching for Melissa?

05:48.849 --> 05:50.782
A shirt and pants.
Huh.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.984
And how many Melissas
did you find?

05:52.986 --> 05:53.985
None.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.487
None. Huh.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.789
So, uh, yeah,
I'm no math doctor,

05:57.791 --> 06:01.660
but that seems to me one less
than we were searching for.

06:01.662 --> 06:04.296
And you think wearing that suit
is gonna help find her?

06:04.298 --> 06:06.398
You catch crazy
<i>with</i> crazy.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.966
Huh? It's
simple logic.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.635
I feel like that might
scare her off even further.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.804
It's not gonna scare her.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.806
Aah! No!

06:14.808 --> 06:15.841
No!
Oh, no, Todd.

06:15.843 --> 06:18.810
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait.
No! No!

06:18.812 --> 06:20.479
Todd, Todd.
Aah!

06:20.481 --> 06:22.981
Bud, it's me. It's me.
It's me, Tandy.
Oh... okay.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.650
Oh, God, you scared
me to death, bud.
I'm so sorry.

06:25.652 --> 06:28.320
I'm so sorry.
Just so you know,

06:28.322 --> 06:30.489
dinosaurs have not
been around for, like,

06:30.491 --> 06:31.690
thousands of years.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.692
I know.
I'm just so tired, bud.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.761
I was out all last night.
I just stopped by

06:35.763 --> 06:38.330
for some power bars and coffee
before I head back out.

06:38.332 --> 06:40.999
I'm worried about you. You need
to get some sleep, bud.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.834
No, I'm fine.
I need to do this.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.537
I just need to amp up
with a little more java.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.839
Hey.
Has anybody seen my mom?

06:47.841 --> 06:50.008
She didn't sleep
in her bed last night.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.676
She said she was
going on vacation,

06:51.678 --> 06:54.012
but she didn't pack a bag
and none of her wines are gone.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.547
Oh, don't worry.
Gail does that.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.682
She'll be back in a couple
of days, reeking of booze,

06:57.684 --> 06:59.584
but she'll be high on life.

06:59.586 --> 07:00.852
And some drugs.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.687
Okay, that's such a relief.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.923
'Cause there was just this
little part of me that thought

07:04.925 --> 07:07.859
that maybe she left
'cause of me.
Why is that?

07:07.861 --> 07:09.861
'Cause she said she was
leaving 'cause of me.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.596
And you got that from that?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.465
Yeah.
She wouldn't do that, right?

07:13.467 --> 07:16.368
Not a chance.
Right, guys?

07:16.370 --> 07:17.536
N-No.
LEWIS: No.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.970
No.
No.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.372
Okay, guys,

07:20.374 --> 07:21.540
we're spending a lot of time

07:21.542 --> 07:22.707
talking about someone

07:22.709 --> 07:24.376
we're pretty sure
is not missing,

07:24.378 --> 07:25.710
while someone we know is missing

07:25.712 --> 07:27.913
is out there
and possibly in danger.

07:27.915 --> 07:31.516
Todd's right. Hey, let's keep
our eyes on the prize.

07:33.486 --> 07:35.554
Whoa.

07:38.491 --> 07:40.559
Real hard to see
in this thing.

07:46.899 --> 07:48.500
TODD (on bullhorn):
Melissa.
CAROL: Melissa!

07:48.502 --> 07:50.936
Melissa?
Melissa!

07:50.938 --> 07:52.070
Melissa?

07:52.072 --> 07:54.573
Mom.
(engine stops)

07:54.575 --> 07:56.908
Lewis, why are we
stopping?

07:56.910 --> 07:59.578
Uh... I want to check out
that shrub.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.781
Think it's a<i> Comprosma rugosa.</i>
Very rare.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.916
At this latitude?
I thought they were indigenous

08:04.918 --> 08:06.852
to the grasslands
of New Zealand.

08:06.854 --> 08:07.919
He's taking a pee.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.654
Oh.

08:09.656 --> 08:10.655
Melissa.

08:10.657 --> 08:11.857
Mom.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.124
Melissa.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.093
TANDY:
Guys, guys!

08:15.095 --> 08:16.595
I found something.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.630
A frigging hula hoop.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.665
Come on, Tandy.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.868
Tag's still on.
That'll be good for resale.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.803
Little help
here?

08:24.805 --> 08:27.672
No?

08:27.674 --> 08:29.941
Okay, I got it.

08:31.777 --> 08:33.879
TODD:
Melissa.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.881
Mom.
Carol, I thought we
talked about this.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.182
We're looking for Melissa.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.551
Yeah, but Gail's...
Gail is fine.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.887
Sorry, I just...

08:41.889 --> 08:43.788
No, I'm sorry. We just
need to focus, all right?

08:43.790 --> 08:44.990
Of course.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.826
Melissa!
Melissa!

08:47.828 --> 08:49.160
Mom!

08:49.162 --> 08:50.795
Oh, I'm so sorry--
old habits.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.030
Melissa.

08:54.066 --> 08:55.634
Melissa.

08:56.802 --> 08:59.504
Melissa.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.706
False alarm.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.842
Hey, it's gonna get dark soon.
Should we head back?

09:03.844 --> 09:05.243
We're not going back
till we find her.

09:07.079 --> 09:08.079
Melissa.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.548
Melissa!

09:09.550 --> 09:11.216
Melissa, please.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.285
Got it.

09:15.988 --> 09:17.656
LEWIS:
Todd?

09:17.658 --> 09:19.224
Todd.

09:20.593 --> 09:22.027
Okay,
so he's out.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.595
Now, what are we gonna do here?

09:23.597 --> 09:24.896
I mean, I want to
find Melissa, too,

09:24.898 --> 09:26.097
but she could be anywhere.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.999
We just can't keep
searching forever.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.734
Yeah, she could be in
another state by now.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.002
Maybe even another country.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.871
Yeah, she didn't
respond to the dinosaur,

09:32.873 --> 09:35.073
so she must be very far away.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.508
Look, chances are
she's gonna eventually

09:36.510 --> 09:37.742
come back home on her own,

09:37.744 --> 09:39.077
so we should just
wait for her there.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.846
Yeah. let's go home.
Maybe Gail's back.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.315
I'll tell him the news.

09:46.686 --> 09:47.953
Todd.

09:49.722 --> 09:50.956
Todd.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.757
(short chuckle)
Boy, is he out.

09:56.195 --> 09:57.596
Todd!

09:57.598 --> 09:59.030
Aah!
Oh, bro-dawg, it's me!

09:59.032 --> 10:00.031
It's me! It's me!

10:00.033 --> 10:02.867
It's me, Tandy.

10:02.869 --> 10:05.036
Oh, Todd, we got
to get you home, bud.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.772
No, we got to keep looking.
Walking around,

10:07.774 --> 10:09.774
shouting "Melissa" is
just not working, man.

10:09.776 --> 10:13.612
Well, it works a hell of a lot
better than doing nothing.

10:13.614 --> 10:14.779
Come on, Todd,
please.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.047
Todd.
TODD:
No, no, no,

10:16.049 --> 10:19.050
you enjoy your sleep, okay?

10:19.052 --> 10:21.052
Todd.
TANDY: Todd, think about
what you're doing.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.221
Please, Todd.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.990
Todd, come back.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.057
Todd.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.160
(crash)

10:29.162 --> 10:30.795
Oh!
Oh...

10:31.964 --> 10:35.066
He literally hit the wall.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.301
(glass rattling)

10:36.303 --> 10:37.936
TODD (over bullhorn):
Melissa!

10:37.938 --> 10:41.072
TANDY:
Todd speed, my friend.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.575
Todd speed.

10:43.577 --> 10:45.777
(laughs)
You hear that?

10:45.779 --> 10:49.581
I said "Godspeed,"
but with "Todd" instead.

10:49.583 --> 10:50.682
Boom.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.589
Todd!
(yells)

10:57.591 --> 10:58.957
You ought to get
some sleep, bud.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.325
Yeah, I was out
all last night again.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.861
I figured a shower might wake
me up before I head back out.

11:11.804 --> 11:13.772
Hey, bud, you okay?

11:13.774 --> 11:15.707
(voice breaking):
Yeah, I'm fine, it's just the...

11:15.709 --> 11:17.275
water from the shower.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.644
(softly):
Hey.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.613
Hey, get in here.

11:21.615 --> 11:23.281
Get in here. Oh.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.616
(crying)

11:24.618 --> 11:26.951
Hey, everything's
gonna be okay, okay?

11:26.953 --> 11:28.353
We're gonna find
her, you hear me?

11:28.355 --> 11:29.854
(crying):
It's just hard, you know?

11:29.856 --> 11:31.990
Because I'm the reason she left.

11:31.992 --> 11:34.225
Maybe I should've just
had a baby with her!

11:34.227 --> 11:36.361
Would a penis compliment
make you feel you better?

11:36.363 --> 11:39.698
No.
No, 'cause got a real
solid one down there, yeah.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.800
It's the exact size
it should be for your body.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.636
It's a tad pale, but
nothing a little sun can't cure.

11:44.638 --> 11:45.704
Tandy.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.172
I'm kidding,
it's the perfect color.

11:47.174 --> 11:50.875
And I'm sorry to imply
otherwise, even jokingly, okay?

11:50.877 --> 11:52.377
Tandy, you want to
make me feel better?

11:52.379 --> 11:53.645
More than anything.

11:53.647 --> 11:55.013
Then help me find her.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.147
You got it.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.649
Okay, let's get back to basics.

11:57.651 --> 11:59.984
What'd that note say?
Okay, it said "good" and "bye."

11:59.986 --> 12:02.087
Now, backwards,
that's "eyb doog."

12:02.089 --> 12:03.388
No, Tandy,
forget the damn note!

12:03.390 --> 12:05.156
Okay, uh, what else do we know?

12:05.158 --> 12:07.358
Uh, we know that she's
wearing a prison outfit.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.894
We know that she's been
digging holes in walls.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.329
We know that she left
under cover of darkness.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.764
Oh, my God.
I know where she is, Tandy.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.332
A prison outfit store!

12:14.334 --> 12:16.167
Yes, that's so obvious.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.168
No.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.269
A hole digging store?

12:18.271 --> 12:19.871
Uh, a cover of darkness store.
No.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.006
Todd, these stores
simply don't exist.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.775
Tandy, she's in Zihuatanejo.

12:23.777 --> 12:24.776
Zihuatanejo?

12:24.778 --> 12:25.877
Yeah, it's where
Andy and Red go

12:25.879 --> 12:26.878
at the end of<i> Shawshank.</i>

12:26.880 --> 12:29.047
Spoiler, dude. God.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.849
Look, come on, let's do this.
Okay. Great.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.117
You go grab me some eye shades
and car pillows,

12:32.119 --> 12:34.119
and then we'll hit the road.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.754
Hey, hit the road.
Why would we hit the road?

12:35.756 --> 12:37.856
Are we mad at it?
Boom. (laughs)

12:37.858 --> 12:40.725
Don't worry about laughing.
I know you're tired.

12:40.727 --> 12:44.429
Oh, get in there,
you little stinker.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.364
(sighs)

12:46.366 --> 12:49.300
Gonna need a hammer.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.870
(quietly):
Okay, where are you?

12:51.872 --> 12:53.805
Bingo.

12:59.211 --> 13:03.381
(plastic creaking, Gail grunts)

13:03.383 --> 13:06.384
I'm sorry, Gordo.

13:06.386 --> 13:11.089
But you always were
a little hardheaded.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.057
(grunts)

13:13.059 --> 13:16.094
Oh, that's gonna work.

13:16.096 --> 13:21.232
Things are looking up
for Gail Klosterman.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.967
Oh...

13:22.969 --> 13:25.003
Fart on a stick!

13:26.772 --> 13:28.072
Hi, Care Bear.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.107
Oh, hey, Tandy.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.175
What's wrong?

13:30.177 --> 13:32.076
Ah, it's just...
Gail's not back yet.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.978
Eh, she's probably
just up in Napa, you know?

13:33.980 --> 13:36.080
Drinking wine,
having a great old time.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.283
She's not in Napa.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.852
She's in trouble.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.453
And I want to go search for her.
Will you help me?

13:42.455 --> 13:43.855
Of course.

13:43.857 --> 13:44.989
TODD:
Ooh.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.758
You ready, bud?
Sure am, bud.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.127
Ready for what?
We're going to Zihuatanejo.

13:49.129 --> 13:51.429
What? No. Tandy has to go
help me find Gail.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.832
Tandy, is that true?
Hey, I can help you both.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.467
Okay, so, uh, Todd,
when do you want to leave?
Now.

13:56.469 --> 13:59.337
And, uh, Carol, when do you want
to go do this Gail thing?
Now.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.939
And you both use
the standard definition

14:00.941 --> 14:02.106
of the word "now"?

14:02.108 --> 14:02.941
Yes.
Yes.

14:02.943 --> 14:03.942
Whitney Houston,

14:03.944 --> 14:06.010
we have a problem.
Hmm.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.813
No, we don't, it's very clear
who the priority is here.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.148
Melissa is the only one

14:10.150 --> 14:11.883
who is in trouble.
CAROL:
They can both be in trouble.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.885
Ever heard of double trouble?

14:13.887 --> 14:15.220
Gail is not in trouble.

14:15.222 --> 14:18.389
Look, a mother and a daughter
share a special connection.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.024
And I can feel it.

14:20.026 --> 14:23.228
She's got into some sort of
horrible accident or something.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.163
No, she didn't.
Yes, she did.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.531
She could be stuck
in a pit somewhere,

14:26.533 --> 14:27.799
or quicksand.

14:27.801 --> 14:30.201
Or even worse, slow sand.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.304
A slower, more torturous
form of dangerous sand.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.539
Gail is fine.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.140
No, she isn't.
Yes, she is.

14:36.142 --> 14:37.141
Then, where is she?

14:37.143 --> 14:40.044
She's avoiding you, okay?

14:40.046 --> 14:42.881
You annoyed the ever-living crap
out of her and she left.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.816
She'll come back
when she wants to.

14:44.818 --> 14:47.085
But right now
we need to look for Melissa.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.320
So stop this phony-baloney
mother-daughter crap,

14:49.322 --> 14:52.056
and start helping,
'cause Melissa needs us now.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.065
Huh.

15:05.504 --> 15:07.839
Look, Carol, this might be
hard for you to hear,

15:07.841 --> 15:10.408
but I need to tell it
to you straight.

15:11.543 --> 15:14.345
Todd is flat out cray.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.947
I'm on your side here.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.349
Gail definitely didn't leave
'cause of you.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.019
Most likely scenario,
she went out to grab you a gift,

15:21.021 --> 15:23.521
slipped on some sort of peel,
likely a banana, but who knows?

15:23.523 --> 15:25.089
Not ruling out citrus.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.358
And now she's lying
at the bottom of some ravine

15:27.360 --> 15:29.427
or, like, impaled
on a security fence.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.561
Definitely dead.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.864
And all 'cause
she loved you so much.

15:32.866 --> 15:34.933
Tandy, I'm your wife,

15:34.935 --> 15:38.536
and I need you
to be honest with me.

15:38.538 --> 15:42.106
You might have pushed her away.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.575
God, what a horrible
daughter I was.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.477
No, you're a great daughter.

15:46.479 --> 15:49.547
And you'll get a chance
to prove it when she comes back.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.483
And she will come back,
'cause she loves you.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.219
Thanks, Tandy.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.287
You're welcome.

16:03.329 --> 16:04.929
Do you want some help?

16:04.931 --> 16:06.564
Help?

16:06.566 --> 16:08.566
Searching for Melissa.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.401
What about Gail?

16:10.403 --> 16:13.104
Why look for someone
who doesn't want to be found?

16:13.106 --> 16:14.172
(soft chuckle)

16:19.411 --> 16:21.913
Look, I'm...

16:21.915 --> 16:24.315
so sorry about earlier.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.018
I-I re-- I really don't know
who that person was.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.586
Well, that was someone
who got very little sleep.

16:28.588 --> 16:29.988
(soft chuckle)

16:29.990 --> 16:32.323
And said some things that
I really needed to hear.

16:34.426 --> 16:37.929
Thank you, Carol.
Aw.

16:37.931 --> 16:41.032
Well... I should get going.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.167
It's like a 35-hour drive, so...

16:43.169 --> 16:44.602
Well, do you want some company?

16:44.604 --> 16:46.037
Really?
Yeah.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.271
I'll go get Tandy.

16:47.273 --> 16:48.272
Okay.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.241
(grunts)

16:54.179 --> 16:55.980
(grunts)

16:55.982 --> 16:58.282
Come on!

16:58.284 --> 17:00.051
Come on.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.454
Come on. Open.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.523
(straining):
Open.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.961
Oh, come on.

17:09.963 --> 17:12.030
Yes.

17:13.298 --> 17:15.466
(screams)

17:15.468 --> 17:18.302
(clattering)

17:18.304 --> 17:22.240
Damn it!

17:22.242 --> 17:24.342
Why should anything good
happen to me?!

17:24.344 --> 17:28.079
Wouldn't want to ruin
my freaking streak!

17:47.433 --> 17:49.500
(grunting and panting)

17:52.171 --> 17:53.671
Whoo!

17:53.673 --> 17:55.073
Hey.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.674
I'm stuck in the elevator.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.109
Fifth floor.

17:58.111 --> 18:01.079
Anyone out there?

18:04.349 --> 18:07.485
Now what?

18:10.122 --> 18:12.190
I got to tell you,

18:12.192 --> 18:15.026
it is so nice to see my best bud

18:15.028 --> 18:16.761
and my main squeeze
talking again.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.030
That was really hard for me.

18:19.032 --> 18:21.199
I don't want to say it was
selfish of you guys, you know,

18:21.201 --> 18:24.235
'cause we're all laying it
on the line, but, uh, I will.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.370
You know,
that was, uh, very selfish.

18:26.372 --> 18:27.405
Oh, my God, look!

18:27.407 --> 18:28.840
Look! Yes!
What, is that the bus?

18:30.375 --> 18:33.644
(tires screech)

18:33.646 --> 18:34.645
(door alert beeping)

18:34.647 --> 18:36.547
Melissa?
TODD:
Melissa.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.116
CAROL AND TODD:
Melissa.

18:39.151 --> 18:42.120
Melissa?
She's not in here.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.654
Melissa?

18:43.656 --> 18:45.556
Melissa.

18:45.558 --> 18:48.459
Melissa?

18:49.428 --> 18:51.796
(ignition stalling)

18:51.798 --> 18:53.297
It's dead.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.565
TODD:
She must've found a new car.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.467
(quietly):
Okay.

18:58.737 --> 19:02.073
Wait, I've seen one
of those cars before.

19:02.075 --> 19:04.175
Oh, my goll,
it's in our parking lot!

19:04.177 --> 19:05.810
Let's go.
Come on.

19:07.513 --> 19:08.646
(engine starts)

19:08.648 --> 19:10.248
CAROL:
Seat belt, seat belt.

19:15.420 --> 19:16.487
(car horn honking)

19:19.158 --> 19:20.558
(honking continues)

19:21.527 --> 19:24.095
(exclaiming)

19:24.097 --> 19:25.263
(tires screech)

19:26.765 --> 19:28.699
Melissa?
Melissa?
Melissa?

19:28.701 --> 19:31.335
Hey. Hey.

19:31.337 --> 19:32.336
I'm in the elevator.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.839
Can you hear me?

19:36.141 --> 19:38.209
What's with all the honking?

Trees and mice!

20:06.573 --> 20:08.139
Oh, my God.

20:08.141 --> 20:09.707
Oh, my God.
We were so worried about you.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.808
Why?

20:10.810 --> 20:12.143
I'm fine.

20:12.145 --> 20:14.245

20:14.247 --> 20:15.713
At home.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.148
Playing cornhole.

20:17.150 --> 20:20.518
Melissa, you've been gone
for two days now.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.553
Oh.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.155
Okay.

20:24.157 --> 20:26.524
Don't leave,
I'm in the elevator!

20:26.526 --> 20:28.492
Where's my bullets?

20:28.494 --> 20:30.228
Where'd I put 'em?

20:30.230 --> 20:31.596
Well, why were you shooting
off your gun?

20:31.598 --> 20:33.898
I didn't.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.935
Okay, y-you mind
if I hold that for you?

20:40.339 --> 20:42.406
Huh?
(softly):
Thank you.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.674

20:43.676 --> 20:45.576
All right?

20:49.781 --> 20:51.916
