00:08.884 --> 00:10.843
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:10.928 --> 00:13.054
There are more than 1 0,000 saints.

00:13.389 --> 00:15.056
What if l choose
the wrong one for the pageant?

00:15.265 --> 00:16.891
How much you got?

00:17.184 --> 00:18.226
Two hundred bucks.

00:23.232 --> 00:25.233
l would love to hear your thoughts

00:25.317 --> 00:28.069
about how All Saints
can better service the community,

00:28.153 --> 00:31.572
especially in relation
to childhood obesity issues.

00:31.990 --> 00:34.325
Chung was a killer
when it came to kids' health.

00:34.410 --> 00:36.786
Yes, Lily is a killer.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.041
All right, you're having a hard day. l can tell.

00:44.712 --> 00:45.837
Kevin, can l... Let me explain.

00:45.921 --> 00:47.463
Are you fucking out of your mind?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.340
This is old. This is not from now.

00:49.425 --> 00:51.259
This is from a long time ago.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.845
Okay? Thirty days clean.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.099
We are okay, Kevin. lt is okay.

00:58.642 --> 01:00.226
lt is okay. We're okay.

02:01.163 --> 02:04.123
l am Christina the Astonishing.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.501
l am from Belgium.

02:07.211 --> 02:13.007
l am remembered for my faith
and my violent fits of ecstasy.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.301
Grace, honey, please stay still.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.597
You are gonna look great
for this pageant thing tonight.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.432
Mom, l'm trying to practice my speech.

02:21.725 --> 02:24.018
-Sorry.
-And it's not a pageant. lt's a litany.

02:24.102 --> 02:27.438
Well, whatever it is, you're going to be
the prettiest saint on the stage.

02:27.523 --> 02:30.441
The storm kept me up
and now l can't remember my lines.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.318
l was born a peasant...

02:32.528 --> 02:34.153
l was born a peasant,

02:34.780 --> 02:37.698
and when l was 21 years old,

02:38.617 --> 02:41.786
l had epilepsy and died.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.496
What's epilepsy?

02:43.580 --> 02:46.541
lt's a neurological disorder
in which you have seizures.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.835
Honey, yes, that's absolutely right,
but if you don't stay still,

02:48.919 --> 02:50.461
l'm going to poke you with this thing.

02:50.629 --> 02:51.629
What are seizures?

02:51.713 --> 02:54.257
l have to practice, with gestures.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.552
Wow, Gracie, you look astonishing.

02:57.803 --> 02:58.803
Dad.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.555
When they had my funeral...

03:00.639 --> 03:04.559
When they had my funeral,
l came back to life

03:05.227 --> 03:08.855
in my coffin and l floated up to the rafters

03:08.939 --> 03:11.566
and told everybody in the church

03:11.650 --> 03:17.572
that l saw heaven and hell and purgatory
while l was dead.

03:18.490 --> 03:19.740
Kev, can you pass me those wings?

03:19.825 --> 03:21.576
She didn't have wings.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.872
lt says she floats up to the rafters
of the church. l made them last night.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.416
lf she had wings, it wouldn't be a miracle.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.878
All right.
You yell at the nuns with that mouth?

03:32.004 --> 03:33.754
Saints, not angels, babe.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.923
l'm never gonna remember my lines.

03:36.008 --> 03:38.134
You're gonna do great.
You're gonna knock it out of the park.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.845
You're gonna dominate. You're gonna
crack them and rack them and stack them.

03:40.929 --> 03:41.888
-Dad.
-And we're gonna be there,

03:41.972 --> 03:43.431
snapping pictures.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.182
You'll be fine, sweetie pie.

03:45.267 --> 03:47.268
Just try to relax, keep your shoulders back,

03:47.352 --> 03:49.937
your eyes straight ahead, keep breathing.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.772
What is the worst that could happen?

03:51.940 --> 03:54.775
Greg, how about you just do yourjob?

03:55.485 --> 03:58.613
And yourjob is to remove
the naked Grecian dude

03:59.281 --> 04:00.615
from my living room.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.534
Yeah, or l take my business elsewhere.

04:03.619 --> 04:04.952
Thank you.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.457
lnterior decorator
wants to go all Greco-Roman.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.083
That's fascinating. Can l get a hug?

04:11.168 --> 04:12.960
Moving into a condo.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.338
Hey, how about that storm last night?

04:15.505 --> 04:18.466
What? No small talk, just a hug?

04:18.967 --> 04:20.176
Just a hug.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.845
Sorry, fresh out.

04:23.347 --> 04:25.389
Flying to Miami tonight to re-up.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.308
Painkiller capital of the world.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.393
Old people, gotta love 'em.

04:29.937 --> 04:33.648
You're going out of town?
You've gotta have something.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.483
Okay, look,

04:36.818 --> 04:38.319
after work, come by my place,

04:38.779 --> 04:41.530
l'll see if l can't scrounge
something up for you, okay?

04:41.615 --> 04:43.699
Your place, like your home?

04:44.576 --> 04:45.618
Relax.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.830
Right up the block.

04:51.083 --> 04:55.753
lt's the deco joint with the gargoyles on top.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.338
Go figure.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.467
There's a doorman. l'll see you later.

05:09.101 --> 05:10.977
Twenty-five-year-old male,
went nuts on the High Line.

05:11.061 --> 05:14.063
Threatened to jump,
clawed a chunk of skin out of his own neck.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.065
-Sherm or dust?
-We're thinking dust.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.026
-He bent the gurney with his bare hands.
-l need a tox screen and Thor.

05:19.111 --> 05:20.611
Bring me my giant!

05:21.571 --> 05:23.114
lt's dust for sure. lt's totally PCP.

05:23.198 --> 05:26.325
Either way, keep him in restraints.
Personally, l think he's a glue-sniffer.

05:26.410 --> 05:31.080
lt looks more like a sherm stick, a cigarette
dipped in formaldehyde. Totally cuckoo.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.708
Everyone has opinions.
No one has information.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.001
-Goodbye.
-Overdose?

05:36.294 --> 05:37.378
Wow.

05:38.463 --> 05:41.007
lt's so hard to know
what's going on inside someone.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.299
Yes, indeed, it is.

05:42.384 --> 05:45.428
Yes, well, you two can stand here
and mull over his right to privacy

05:45.512 --> 05:48.097
while Thor draws blood for a tox screen.
Thor?

05:48.390 --> 05:49.390
On it.

05:54.646 --> 05:59.483
l have a gift certificate to Utsav. lndian. $50.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.569
-Wanna have lunch?
-You and l?

06:02.237 --> 06:04.655
Jackie, too. lt's $50.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.158
Jacks, Zoey's invited us to lunch.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.161
Today? Let me think about it.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.246
Come on. lt's one lunch.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.331
Really?

06:14.416 --> 06:16.042
'Cause if either of you
ever asked me to lunch...

06:16.126 --> 06:20.087
-l've invited you to lunch.
-l know, and l jumped at the chance.

06:20.547 --> 06:24.675
Come on, l do everything for you guys.
l sing your praises on high.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.886
And now l want to buy you lunch

06:26.970 --> 06:30.598
and you're looking at each other
like, "l'll go if you go."

06:33.226 --> 06:36.520
Fine, l'll say it out loud.
Jackie, l'll go if you go.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.815
Yeah, no, it's fine with me. Lunch is lunch.

06:40.609 --> 06:41.734
What?

06:42.069 --> 06:43.486
No one sounds excited.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.489
ln with the new, out with the old.
New phone.

06:47.449 --> 06:48.491
She sounds excited.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.468
Come in.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.077
l wanted to give you a heads up.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.329
My phone's gonna be down for a little bit.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.665
l made this in the fifth grade.

07:37.833 --> 07:39.083
Very nice.

07:39.167 --> 07:42.378
lt's a diorama
of a 1 9th century dentist's office.

07:43.547 --> 07:46.841
The three of us made it together
for social studies.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.678
We were up all night.

07:54.808 --> 07:59.186
l'm gonna have this conversation
with you once and only once.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.606
Your mothers called me, both of them.

08:03.692 --> 08:07.778
They told me about the divorce
and that they're worried about you.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.197
This is not my job!

08:10.282 --> 08:13.200
You have two mothers.
You don't need a third.

08:14.536 --> 08:17.454
Get your act together and clean your office.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.041
This is a health hazard.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.712
What would you do if you were me?

08:28.216 --> 08:29.550
l'd purge.

08:34.222 --> 08:37.391
Back from the lab.
Spazzed-out guy in 3? PCP.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.227
He's due for Ativan. Do you mind?

08:41.062 --> 08:42.938
Drug cases are kind of weird for me.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.399
You know,
l'm just trying to negotiate everything.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.443
The drug cases? Really?

08:47.527 --> 08:49.737
Sam, you're a nurse.
You don't get to choose who you treat.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.989
No, l know. l'm just saying if...

08:52.073 --> 08:56.327
Okay, what would your sponsor
or whatever tell you?

08:57.704 --> 08:58.913
He'd tell me to be of service.

08:58.997 --> 09:02.166
Okay, be of service,
be a productive member of this staff.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.377
Assist Dr. O'Hara
in treating this afflicted man.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.671
Yeah. Yeah, you're...

09:09.007 --> 09:11.175
l'm sorry, Jackie. You're right.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.435
You would so kick ass in AA.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.065
What? She would.

09:26.733 --> 09:27.775
You're on your own.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.362
Sore topic.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.447
Not for me.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.976
This is Dr. Cooper.
He's gonna be taking care of you.

10:02.435 --> 10:07.439
These ladies skipped school,
hit the bottle, then hit the sidewalk.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.108
l fell.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.485
She was like, bop!

10:17.117 --> 10:19.827
He's totally the guy from the bus stop.

10:19.995 --> 10:23.998
-The "looks can cure" guy?
-Oh, my God, you're so hot.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.666
Hot stop.

10:28.586 --> 10:32.131
My God, you're totally, like,
sexy doctor man.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.592
Stitches, and let's get an x-ray.

10:35.677 --> 10:39.138
-We both wanna marry doctors.
-Or even a nurse.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.640
l'd get with a nurse, cause they're healers.

10:41.725 --> 10:44.977
-Do you know it.
-Doctors make some money.

10:47.188 --> 10:50.441
Girls, l'm gonna drop some wisdom on you.

10:51.026 --> 10:53.610
You don't have to do that, Dr. Cooper.

10:53.695 --> 10:57.197
So many things that we love are illusions.

10:58.450 --> 11:02.578
Look at these shoes. These shoes are $600.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.039
lllusions.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.792
Look at this phone. Awesome phone.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.086
lllusion.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.718
But this guy, this guy is real.

11:23.558 --> 11:25.351
Are you really real?

11:26.978 --> 11:28.062
100%¤.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.942
Shit. That tree took out a power line.

11:34.027 --> 11:37.029
l had no electricity for six hours.
Beer's gonna be warm.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.280
You're up and running now.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.907
Hey, good to know people in high places.

11:39.991 --> 11:41.408
l appreciate you coming out.

11:41.493 --> 11:42.701
City Hall is going nuts, l bet.

11:43.787 --> 11:46.914
Yeah, a terrible storm,
trees down everywhere.

11:46.998 --> 11:50.000
l heard about this one on a dispatch
and l thought l'd swing by.

11:50.085 --> 11:51.835
What's it been, eight years?

11:51.920 --> 11:54.046
-Fi's baptism.
-Eight years.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.548
Look, Kev,

11:57.592 --> 11:58.550
l ran a check

11:58.635 --> 12:01.470
just to make sure you still owned
the place before l trekked out here,

12:01.596 --> 12:04.681
noticed you had an outstanding ticket
a few months back.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.558
Yeah, l got pulled over.

12:06.643 --> 12:09.645
Seventy-five in a 30, two kids in the car?

12:10.438 --> 12:11.772
l was in a rush.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.858
Pay the ticket, Kev, you're overdue.
They will nail you.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.276
l'm working on it.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.445
-You want a warm beer?
-l'd love one.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.162
lndia.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.875
This is nice.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.215
Yes, it is.
Zoey, you're right, this is a nice gesture.

12:44.389 --> 12:48.809
So, Dr. O'Hara, how would you
characterize your friendship with Jackie?

12:48.935 --> 12:50.144
Excuse me?

12:50.311 --> 12:53.021
Zoey, tell me this is not for that blog thing.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.149
My next entry is titled:

12:55.233 --> 12:58.902
"Doctors and Nurses:
No longer cats and dogs."

12:58.987 --> 13:01.155
-No, it isn't.
-Zoey, you do realize

13:01.239 --> 13:02.823
if you mention either of us online,

13:02.907 --> 13:05.242
we will cut you into little pieces
and feed you to snakes.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.202
Your names are changed.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.829
Lady Penelope

13:09.330 --> 13:11.373
and Taffy.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.001
You named me Taffy?

13:15.670 --> 13:19.506
lt's just that l look at the two of you
and l see something,

13:21.092 --> 13:23.510
you know, rare and amazing.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.179
l think people could learn.

13:25.263 --> 13:28.640
My fondness for nurses
does not extend beyond Jackie.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.605
And you, of course.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.023
Of course.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.861
What about Kelly? Everybody loves Kelly.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.071
The ladies love Kelly.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.157
Yeah, well, we are not ladies.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.867
Way to go, Taffy.

13:47.035 --> 13:49.286
Wait, so you guys don't like Kelly.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.371
No, Zoey, we did not say that.

13:51.456 --> 13:52.956
Kinda you did.

13:54.459 --> 13:57.252
Just in case you were tempted to stab her.

13:58.254 --> 14:01.965
l did that already. l punched in star.
Oh, for God's sakes.

14:03.718 --> 14:07.137
Do you know how to work this phone?
l am so backed up.

14:07.263 --> 14:11.225
These things are supposed
to help us do ourjobs. Piece ofjunk.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.564
l want to demonstrate something to you.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.152
Purging.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.362
So what do you want, a cookie?

14:24.489 --> 14:25.739
l need a hug.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.367
-No.
-Come on, Gloria. Just a hug.

14:28.576 --> 14:31.328
Don't call me that. And no. l need Thor.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.747
Tell him to get in here.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.041
You know,
there are lots of people that would hug me.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.252
Then find them and hug them.

14:45.677 --> 14:48.428
She fucking drove off with my kids.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.764
l'm standing there in the middle of nowhere,

14:50.848 --> 14:53.475
had to call a buddy to pick me up
on his motorcycle.

14:54.811 --> 14:57.646
Look, you married a piece of work. Jackie?

14:57.772 --> 15:01.275
Jackie'd chew off her own paw
before she gave an inch.

15:01.693 --> 15:04.403
l've never been so angry at her
in my entire life.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.822
Next day, she goes off to work.

15:06.906 --> 15:10.367
l pack suitcases for the girls,
l put them in the car and l take off.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.452
You left her?

15:12.704 --> 15:14.329
l was in a state.

15:15.456 --> 15:18.542
l didn't realize how fast l was going
until l saw the flashing lights.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.002
And then what?

15:20.420 --> 15:23.672
l got pulled over and went home.
lt was just...

15:24.632 --> 15:25.757
Rage.

15:28.219 --> 15:31.930
What are you, a battered wife?
Taking the kids and leaving?

15:32.599 --> 15:34.141
Fuck off, Carl.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.060
l was out of my head.

15:37.145 --> 15:41.607
l'd been happily married for 1 5 years
and suddenly, l've got an exit plan.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.484
And rage.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.821
l've got a lot of rage.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.449
You ever consider
stepping out of your marriage?

15:50.533 --> 15:53.452
Not permanently, just a little something...

15:54.579 --> 15:55.662
No.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.585
Well, speaking only for myself,
there were a couple of times...

16:01.669 --> 16:05.339
Yeah, l get it, but that's you.

16:06.257 --> 16:09.176
You were a big deal, Kev. You had your pick.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.761
Don't ever forget that.

16:10.845 --> 16:12.596
And l picked Jackie.

16:14.057 --> 16:15.599
Loud and clear.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.107
Whose bag is in the middle of the floor?

16:24.192 --> 16:25.859
-That's our bag!
-All right.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.694
-You can't take that beer...
-That's our beer. Private...

16:27.820 --> 16:29.154
Pipe down!

16:30.615 --> 16:31.907
-Hey, Slater.
-Yeah?

16:32.033 --> 16:33.158
What are you doing?

16:33.242 --> 16:34.701
l'm following up with the concussion.

16:35.036 --> 16:37.537
Check on the PCP in 3. Now.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.040
Yes, ma'am.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.734
The line's crimped.

17:07.819 --> 17:11.154
You might want to keep him restrained.
That dog bites.

17:11.239 --> 17:12.197
He's knocked out.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.824
Yeah, well, PCP.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.284
All right.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.089
Are you okay?

17:38.599 --> 17:39.850
l'm fine.

17:43.020 --> 17:46.523
You've got remote access
to all phone services through VPN,

17:46.607 --> 17:49.776
unified messaging,
rich-media conferencing,

17:50.319 --> 17:53.029
this thing could probably make waffles.

17:53.114 --> 17:55.407
How do l make a telephone call?

17:56.242 --> 17:58.618
Well, here we go. Up and running.

17:58.953 --> 18:01.079
-Lily Chung calling.
-Don't answer it.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.249
-l want to show you how it works.
-Thor, listen to me.

18:05.168 --> 18:07.210
Last night,
after one too many vodka gimlets,

18:07.295 --> 18:10.297
l called Lily Chung twice, maybe three times,

18:10.381 --> 18:14.968
and left a series of
increasingly embarrassing voice mails.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.971
Drunk dialing, know it well.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.309
You're afraid of this woman? You?

18:23.060 --> 18:25.061
She makes me feel unaccomplished.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.815
She's my Voldemort.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.028
May l?

18:36.240 --> 18:38.241
Gloria Akalitus's office.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.661
l see.
l'm sorry, she's not in the office right now.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.498
Maybe l can reach her. Hey, Megan,

18:44.624 --> 18:47.584
see if you can reach Ms. Akalitus
at Mayor Bloomberg's office.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.504
They're having their Tuesday lunch.
Thanks, hon.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.007
Hello, Ms. Chung?

18:56.511 --> 19:00.180
Of course, you can try her tomorrow.
l'll let her know you called.

19:00.765 --> 19:01.848
Bye.

19:05.603 --> 19:08.396
Holler at your boy.

19:10.441 --> 19:12.108
Come on. He gets a hug?

19:19.200 --> 19:21.201
That looks like it hurts.

19:21.786 --> 19:23.036
l'm fine.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.789
That's gonna bruise.

19:25.873 --> 19:29.084
You're gonna wanna get in front of that,
get something from Eddie.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.502
l'm fine.

19:32.588 --> 19:37.217
Even if it's just for your nerves.
You look pale. You should take something.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.177
l'm fine.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.934
Last call.

19:57.655 --> 20:00.073
This place really does need a bar.

20:05.246 --> 20:06.913
Hey, l heard.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.167
-You okay?
-Don't know.

20:14.005 --> 20:17.549
Well, what are we talking about?

20:17.633 --> 20:20.886
Benzo for nerves? Percocet for pain?

20:21.512 --> 20:23.597
Maybe something in between?

20:25.766 --> 20:28.435
Fuck it all. l'll live with it.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.273
Wow. People still do that?

20:39.780 --> 20:41.406
lt's scary shit, huh?

20:42.700 --> 20:43.783
Yeah.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.664
lt's all right.

20:55.129 --> 20:56.755
What an asshole.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.382
Sorry.

21:15.566 --> 21:16.983
-Hello?
-Mom?

21:17.860 --> 21:19.235
Gracie, what's wrong?

21:19.320 --> 21:21.154
l borrowed Alison's phone.

21:21.906 --> 21:24.491
l'm in the bathroom.
l'm not supposed to be on the phone.

21:24.575 --> 21:26.826
-What's the matter, honey?
-Nothing.

21:31.248 --> 21:32.916
l just wanted to tell you

21:33.000 --> 21:36.753
that l liked the wings you made for me.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.338
The wings?

21:38.422 --> 21:40.048
You were being nice.

21:40.508 --> 21:41.883
l was mean.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.511
I didn't mean to be mean.

21:45.513 --> 21:48.014
lt's just that she wasn't an angel.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.433
She was a saint.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.353
Gracie.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.981
l have to go. l don't want to get caught.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.440
Okay, honey.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.694
Honey?

22:02.488 --> 22:03.697
Bye-bye.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.849
No, thanks. l dined with the girls.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.770
That reminds me.

22:37.231 --> 22:40.692
A little heads up
from someone who's been here awhile.

22:40.943 --> 22:47.574
l cannot emphasize enough the importance
of getting along with Jackie.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.954
Well, l think we get along great.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.706
Why? Did she say something?

22:54.790 --> 22:58.251
-Because if she doesn't like me...
-No, no one said anything.

22:58.419 --> 23:02.297
l tried to be gossipy and it's totally
backfiring. Abort. Abort. Abort.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.925
Slater, you wanna try taking it easy
around the jailbait?

23:08.262 --> 23:10.680
-l don't know what you're talking about.
-The hell you don't.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.601
l'm not gonna engage in this.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.274
l'm not jailbait.

23:21.358 --> 23:23.401
l wasn't talking about you.

23:24.779 --> 23:26.196
-l used to be jailbait.
-Shut up.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.281
My bait used to be very jail.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.913
-Are you kidding me right now?
-What are they, like, 1 6?

23:34.997 --> 23:37.040
Seriously, lady, back the fuck off.

23:37.124 --> 23:38.083
You think l'm stupid?

23:38.167 --> 23:40.668
lf you're gonna accuse me,
do it through proper channels.

23:40.753 --> 23:43.213
But remember, you're the one
in the men's room right now.

23:43.297 --> 23:45.215
lf you're gonna come after me,
l'm coming after you.

23:45.299 --> 23:48.009
-l know what l saw.
-You're fucking high!

23:52.598 --> 23:53.973
As you were.

23:56.894 --> 23:57.977
Hey.

24:02.358 --> 24:03.817
How's O'Hara?

24:04.485 --> 24:05.610
She says she's fine.

24:11.158 --> 24:12.700
-You okay?
-Me?

24:14.245 --> 24:15.620
Yeah, fine.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.420
ls she taking anything for it?

24:24.672 --> 24:26.881
She says she doesn't want any.

24:28.425 --> 24:31.594
God. l think she's in more pain
than she lets on.

24:37.601 --> 24:40.019
That PCP guy was a disaster.

24:40.521 --> 24:42.689
l threw my back out trying to restrain him.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.775
Well, back again, huh?

24:50.364 --> 24:52.365
Try Pilates or something?

24:54.910 --> 24:56.703
You know what, Eddie?

24:57.580 --> 24:58.872
Fuck you.

25:06.505 --> 25:12.093
So, just to be clear,
are we throwing these out or...

25:12.178 --> 25:13.511
No. What?

25:14.471 --> 25:15.597
No. We're just...

25:17.349 --> 25:19.309
We're just keeping them in here.

25:19.810 --> 25:20.894
Okay.

25:23.397 --> 25:25.190
l like the dollhouse.

25:25.399 --> 25:27.233
lt's not a dollhouse.

25:28.736 --> 25:31.946
But you could use it as one, though,

25:33.991 --> 25:37.202
if you had dolls and they needed a house.

25:39.413 --> 25:41.247
lt still wouldn't be a dollhouse.

25:41.582 --> 25:43.291
What is it, anyway?

25:43.918 --> 25:47.754
lt's a replica of a 1 9th century
dentist office made to scale.

25:48.756 --> 25:51.424
l even made the dentist
and the little man in the chair.

25:53.886 --> 25:58.139
When l was little,
everything had to be perfect or l'd freak out.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.934
Look at that poor guy.

26:01.810 --> 26:02.977
Looks like it hurts.

26:03.479 --> 26:06.689
He's having his impacted molar extracted
without anesthesia,

26:06.774 --> 26:09.359
so yeah, it hurts.

26:12.196 --> 26:13.446
lt does.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.977
Have a good night, sir.

27:16.677 --> 27:19.178
I am Christina the Astonishing.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.141
l am from Belgium.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.478
l am remembered for my faith

27:28.772 --> 27:31.774
and my violent fits of ecstasy.

27:57.468 --> 28:03.222
l am the patron saint of insanity
and lunatics.

28:04.892 --> 28:07.894
l died but came back to life.

28:10.481 --> 28:14.567
Psalm 1 02 is attributed to me.

28:16.904 --> 28:19.322
lt is the prayer of the afflicted.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.371
"For my days vanish like smoke.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.583
"l am like an owl in the desert

28:31.543 --> 28:33.086
"among the ruins.

28:35.923 --> 28:38.633
"l have mingled my drink with weeping.

28:39.802 --> 28:42.053
"And my days are like a shadow.

28:45.432 --> 28:46.933
"Pray for me."
