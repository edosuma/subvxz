WEBVTT

00:04.281 --> 00:05.346
- Hey.
- Yes.

00:05.416 --> 00:07.282
Oh, Becky, this is Ben.

00:07.351 --> 00:08.584
Ben, my sister, Becky.

00:08.652 --> 00:10.352
- Oh.
- Perfect. I'm on break.

00:12.089 --> 00:14.823
- So nice to finally meet you.
- Yeah.

00:14.925 --> 00:17.126
So, what do you see in her?

00:18.251 --> 00:19.517
Uh, excuse me?

00:19.580 --> 00:22.493
As the first person in
the family to finally meet Ben,

00:22.540 --> 00:24.440
I feel a certain obligation to grill him

00:24.491 --> 00:25.656
and make him feel uncomfortable.

00:27.791 --> 00:29.991
So, are you serious about her,

00:30.060 --> 00:32.127
or is it just about
the disappointing sex?

00:33.430 --> 00:36.631
Uh, that was wildly inappropriate.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.366
The sex is not disappointing.

00:38.435 --> 00:40.668
He's a middle-aged man
doing the best that he can.

00:42.539 --> 00:44.906
Oh!

00:44.975 --> 00:47.175
Okay. I get it. The gloves are off?

00:47.244 --> 00:48.877
All right. Let's do this.

00:48.979 --> 00:50.812
Darlene won't commit to being serious

00:50.881 --> 00:53.415
because she's afraid to be vulnerable.

00:53.483 --> 00:55.550
And you seem like a lunatic.

00:56.853 --> 00:58.686
Okay. My turn, my turn.

00:58.789 --> 01:01.289
I am afraid to be vulnerable

01:01.391 --> 01:03.324
because he's too old
to have never been married,

01:03.427 --> 01:05.660
and I think there's something
broken inside there.

01:07.130 --> 01:09.697
Who says I'm not married?
You barely know me.

01:12.169 --> 01:13.735
Oh. Let's go. That's my dad.

01:13.837 --> 01:14.936
Oh! Why can't I meet him?

01:15.005 --> 01:16.504
Oh, we got to do this
one Conner at a time.

01:16.573 --> 01:18.173
You barely got past Becky.

01:20.577 --> 01:22.043
What up, Daddy-o?

01:22.112 --> 01:23.778
Picking up lunch for my crew.

01:23.847 --> 01:25.747
No need to lie to me, Dad.

01:25.816 --> 01:27.415
Enjoy your four meals.

01:29.953 --> 01:31.586
- Hey, Dan.
- Hey, Louise.

01:31.655 --> 01:33.354
Remember when we were
talking about your band

01:33.423 --> 01:35.023
and I couldn't remember
the name of that group

01:35.125 --> 01:36.291
I used to like?

01:36.359 --> 01:37.258
Found 'em.

01:37.327 --> 01:39.294
Oh, my God.

01:39.396 --> 01:41.930
Baby Huey & the Babysitters.

01:42.032 --> 01:43.665
"Messin' with the Kid."

01:43.767 --> 01:45.333
♪ You can call it what you want ♪

01:45.402 --> 01:48.636
♪ But I call it messin' with the kid ♪

01:48.705 --> 01:49.671
Wow.

01:49.739 --> 01:51.739
You know, right when I left Lanford,

01:51.808 --> 01:53.908
I got to Chicago, I sat in with them.

01:54.010 --> 01:56.144
- No!
- Oh, yeah.

01:56.213 --> 01:57.579
Then they looked over, saw me sittin'

01:57.647 --> 01:59.647
on the edge of the stage,
and I got thrown out.

02:01.685 --> 02:03.718
It's so nice to have you back.

02:03.787 --> 02:05.286
I remember you packing your drums

02:05.355 --> 02:07.455
in the back of your LeBaron
after graduation

02:07.557 --> 02:09.424
and heading down to Chicago
with your band.

02:09.526 --> 02:11.526
Yeah, that was
the beginning of the long,

02:11.561 --> 02:14.262
slow climb to the bottom.

02:14.331 --> 02:16.030
Well, I was jealous of you.

02:16.099 --> 02:18.366
I still kick myself for
not taking my guitar

02:18.435 --> 02:19.868
and hitting the road like you did.

02:19.903 --> 02:21.569
Mm. Don't beat yourself up.

02:21.671 --> 02:23.137
You were terrible.

02:24.808 --> 02:25.940
I'm okay with that.

02:26.009 --> 02:28.076
I'm kind of the Jimmy Page of drywall.

02:29.713 --> 02:32.814
So, I have a little
surprise for you, too.

02:32.883 --> 02:35.183
I have an extra ticket
for an oldies concert

02:35.252 --> 02:36.951
in Ravinia tomorrow night.

02:37.020 --> 02:38.686
You want to go with me and my buddies?

02:38.755 --> 02:39.787
Who's playing?

02:39.856 --> 02:42.123
Just a bunch of bands
from the '60s and '70s...

02:42.225 --> 02:44.826
what's left of 'em, anyway.

02:44.895 --> 02:48.663
There's, uh, Gladys Knight & the Pip,

02:48.732 --> 02:52.567
uh, the Two Tops,

02:52.636 --> 02:53.735
and a Righteous Brother.

02:55.539 --> 02:59.007
I'm going, on the odd chance
I get to see One Dog Night.

03:45.221 --> 03:47.488
Harris? What happened? Are you okay?

03:47.591 --> 03:49.190
She's fine. Are you the mom?

03:49.292 --> 03:51.593
No, I'm the aunt.

03:51.695 --> 03:52.961
What happened?

03:53.063 --> 03:54.362
She got caught drinking in the woods

03:54.464 --> 03:55.897
with some of her friends.

03:55.999 --> 03:57.365
I'm the only one who didn't get away

03:57.467 --> 03:58.967
because I was wearing heels.

03:59.069 --> 04:01.302
Why were you wearing heels in the woods?

04:01.404 --> 04:02.570
There was a guy there that I liked,

04:02.672 --> 04:04.272
and I wanted my ass to look good.

04:05.709 --> 04:07.809
You must be very proud.

04:07.911 --> 04:10.445
Thank you, Officer.
I can take it from here.

04:10.547 --> 04:11.946
Fine. Just tell her parents

04:12.048 --> 04:14.349
that she's been hanging
with a bad crowd.

04:14.451 --> 04:16.551
I really hope I don't have to
come back to this house again.

04:16.653 --> 04:18.152
That's what everyone says.

04:20.557 --> 04:21.990
Come back here.

04:22.091 --> 04:24.092
All right. Let's have the lecture.

04:24.194 --> 04:26.794
Yeah, you're gonna get a lecture.

04:26.896 --> 04:28.830
First, you got to figure out
your escape route

04:28.932 --> 04:30.898
<i>before</i> you get hammered.

04:31.001 --> 04:33.001
And make sure it's downhill
so if you trip,

04:33.136 --> 04:35.136
you can roll out of danger.

04:36.139 --> 04:37.038
Wait, what?

04:37.140 --> 04:38.773
And if you're with a nerdy girl,

04:38.875 --> 04:41.776
push her down at the first
sight of trouble.

04:41.878 --> 04:44.112
You get away,
she gets a cool reputation...

04:44.214 --> 04:46.214
it's a win-win.

04:46.316 --> 04:47.782
Why are you telling me this?

04:47.884 --> 04:50.351
Because even though I'm not
happy that you were drinking,

04:50.453 --> 04:53.087
I don't want you getting caught
because your friends are stupid.

04:53.189 --> 04:55.023
Thank you.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.326
You know, I got to tell you,

04:58.428 --> 04:59.327
I'm kind of surprised

04:59.429 --> 05:00.762
that you're even helping me.

05:00.830 --> 05:02.030
I didn't think you liked me.

05:02.132 --> 05:04.532
Of course I like you.
Why would you think that?

05:04.634 --> 05:06.167
Because I've been here for a year,

05:06.269 --> 05:07.735
and you've barely talked to me.

05:09.806 --> 05:12.507
Okay. Sit down.

05:15.345 --> 05:17.178
Remember that Christmas when you were 8,

05:17.280 --> 05:18.680
and I wanted you to see

05:18.782 --> 05:20.381
what a really strong woman was,

05:20.483 --> 05:21.949
so I showed you "Kill Bill"?

05:22.052 --> 05:23.451
Yeah.

05:23.553 --> 05:24.819
It was more decapitations

05:24.888 --> 05:27.155
than I've seen before or since.

05:27.257 --> 05:30.358
But your mom totally flipped out on me.

05:30.460 --> 05:33.494
Ever since that, everything
I do or say around you,

05:33.596 --> 05:36.164
I'm worried your mom's
gonna freak out about.

05:36.266 --> 05:37.832
And I'm not judging your mom.

05:37.901 --> 05:39.600
We're different people.

05:39.703 --> 05:42.370
I'm cool, and she's an uptight psycho.

05:43.773 --> 05:46.340
Are you cool enough to not
tell my mom about tonight?

05:49.546 --> 05:51.979
Okay. Here's the deal.

05:52.048 --> 05:54.215
Stop drinking in the woods...

05:54.284 --> 05:56.718
and I'll give you this one pass
as a cool aunt.

05:56.786 --> 05:58.186
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

05:58.288 --> 06:00.088
It will never happen again.

06:00.156 --> 06:03.057
But you can't ever tell her
that I didn't tell her.

06:03.126 --> 06:07.028
Why would I do that?
That would be telling her.

06:07.097 --> 06:09.864
There will be a time when
you guys are hanging out

06:09.933 --> 06:11.466
and you'll feel like you're friends

06:11.568 --> 06:13.167
and you'll want to share everything.

06:13.236 --> 06:16.003
Do not fall for that. It's a trap.

06:23.346 --> 06:26.080
Wow. Somebody's been
to the back of her closet.

06:26.116 --> 06:27.315
Yeah, well,

06:27.383 --> 06:29.217
that's why I wore the shawl over here.

06:29.319 --> 06:30.518
No, uh, Peter's doing a project

06:30.587 --> 06:32.887
for his master's degree
in Nordic history,

06:32.989 --> 06:34.989
so we're simulating the daily life

06:35.058 --> 06:37.525
of a couple in medieval Norway.

06:38.928 --> 06:41.062
Why?

06:41.131 --> 06:43.931
Uh, it's, uh, interdisciplinary study

06:44.033 --> 06:45.700
where he's trying to document

06:45.769 --> 06:48.469
the sociology of relationships
at that time,

06:48.538 --> 06:51.706
and unless we replicate
the experiences exactly,

06:51.741 --> 06:54.342
then it invalidates the study.

06:54.410 --> 06:55.843
I haven't had enough coffee

06:55.945 --> 06:58.646
to... to have this conversation.

06:58.715 --> 07:01.549
So you don't get to use
any modern conveniences?

07:01.618 --> 07:03.017
Well, you guys just don't know the joy

07:03.086 --> 07:04.352
of living close to the earth.

07:04.454 --> 07:07.388
Do you have a, um,
wire brush I can borrow?

07:07.457 --> 07:09.690
I have to scrape the fur off a squirrel.

07:11.828 --> 07:13.561
You're eating a squirrel?

07:13.663 --> 07:14.896
Well,<i> many</i> squirrels.

07:14.998 --> 07:18.766
While they're hibernating,
there's not a lot to 'em.

07:18.835 --> 07:20.768
Okay, guys.

07:20.837 --> 07:23.938
Here's your salami pancake sandwiches.

07:24.007 --> 07:25.807
You may want to trade these.

07:28.178 --> 07:30.378
Okay, who's using the washing machine?

07:30.480 --> 07:33.281
Oh, I don't know, the people
who live here?

07:33.349 --> 07:35.430
Do you know Louise Goldufski?

07:35.493 --> 07:37.819
She works at the restaurant now.

07:37.887 --> 07:39.887
Yeah, she was in Dan
and Roseanne's class.

07:39.956 --> 07:41.923
Star of the talent show!

07:43.960 --> 07:46.994
Every year, she and her
stupid band would go long

07:47.063 --> 07:50.665
while somebody with a very
moving rifle-twirling routine

07:50.767 --> 07:52.433
couldn't even get up on stage.

07:54.270 --> 07:57.171
Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure she
made a move on Dad yesterday.

07:58.541 --> 08:00.975
Ohh, you're kidding.

08:01.077 --> 08:02.343
What did he do?

08:02.412 --> 08:04.946
- He had no clue.
- Oh, no. No.

08:05.048 --> 08:06.747
He's been out of the game for too long.

08:06.850 --> 08:10.251
He has no idea how vicious
these gals can be.

08:10.320 --> 08:13.020
With a fresh widower in their sights,

08:13.122 --> 08:14.856
Dan's a mouse in a field,

08:14.958 --> 08:18.359
and she's like this hawk
with her talons out.

08:18.461 --> 08:22.129
You've changed since you started
hunting your own food.

08:22.198 --> 08:24.432
I'm telling you... he's a catch.

08:24.534 --> 08:25.633
We should warn him.

08:25.735 --> 08:27.468
It's weird. I've never
thought of Dad as a catch.

08:27.570 --> 08:29.136
Are you kidding me? At his age,

08:29.239 --> 08:30.938
he can fall down
and get up on his own...

08:31.040 --> 08:32.607
The ladies love it!

08:33.909 --> 08:34.876
I'm gonna grab a bite.

08:34.977 --> 08:36.878
I'll be back later to do my laundry.

08:36.980 --> 08:38.511
I got it.

08:38.581 --> 08:39.947
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
be out in the yard.

08:40.049 --> 08:42.450
I got to look for a stick
in the shape of a fork.

08:48.224 --> 08:49.290
Hi. Can I help you?

08:49.392 --> 08:51.092
Is Harris Healy here?

08:51.194 --> 08:53.694
Uh, n-no, she's in school.
Is something wrong?

08:53.763 --> 08:56.297
She left this in my squad car.

08:58.568 --> 09:00.434
My daughter was in your car? Why?

09:00.536 --> 09:02.503
I guess your sister didn't tell you.

09:02.605 --> 09:05.873
I caught her in the woods
drinking last night.

09:05.975 --> 09:08.676
Wha... You've got to be kidding me.

09:08.778 --> 09:10.778
Um... okay.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.681
Well, thank you
for bringing her home safe.

09:14.851 --> 09:16.284
By the way, there's gonna be reports

09:16.386 --> 09:17.585
of screaming from this house later.

09:17.654 --> 09:20.110
You guys should just ignore that.

09:29.195 --> 09:30.361
Whatcha doin'?

09:30.445 --> 09:32.946
Um, cutting vegetables with a rock.

09:33.004 --> 09:34.961
You want to help me? It's infuriating.

09:36.922 --> 09:39.189
[Speaking Old Norse] woman.

09:39.257 --> 09:41.291
I bring nourishment from the sea.

09:44.062 --> 09:45.762
Did you buy that at a store?

09:45.831 --> 09:47.297
I got it from that fish market.

09:47.399 --> 09:48.565
I bartered for it,

09:48.667 --> 09:51.634
trading them zinc, nickel, and copper.

09:53.538 --> 09:55.505
Some day, they will call them "coins."

09:57.109 --> 09:58.775
I'm cutting a turnip with a rock,

09:58.877 --> 10:01.578
and you went out and bought a fish.

10:01.646 --> 10:04.047
Well, the important thing is
that I have provided dinner

10:04.116 --> 10:06.383
in a historically accurate way.

10:06.451 --> 10:08.151
I will now leave you to clean the fish

10:08.220 --> 10:10.120
while I retire to the living room

10:10.222 --> 10:12.355
to play my shinbone flute.

10:12.424 --> 10:14.090
No, no, no. No.

10:14.192 --> 10:17.060
No. I scraped the fur off a squirrel.

10:17.129 --> 10:18.294
You're gutting the fish.

10:18.397 --> 10:19.829
I need a couple hours without the smell

10:19.898 --> 10:21.931
of death on my fingers.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.402
Viking women were often
overwhelmed by their chores,

10:25.470 --> 10:27.537
but generally suffered in silence.

10:36.481 --> 10:38.150
The only thing I know about Vikings

10:38.197 --> 10:39.634
is from "Hagar,"

10:39.684 --> 10:41.351
and from what I remember,
he and his wife

10:41.420 --> 10:43.887
used to like to fight in the
privacy of their own yurt.

10:45.424 --> 10:48.224
Finally, the washer's free.

10:48.293 --> 10:49.793
Have you guys had a little talk yet?

10:49.895 --> 10:51.494
Little talk about what?

10:51.596 --> 10:52.695
Nothing.

10:52.798 --> 10:54.297
We were just talking about how well

10:54.399 --> 10:55.632
you and Louise were getting along.

10:55.734 --> 10:58.368
Open your eyes, Dan!

11:00.539 --> 11:03.306
That man-eater's trying to
get into your Kirklands.

11:05.143 --> 11:06.743
It's true, Dad. I saw it myself.

11:06.845 --> 11:08.411
She was totally flirting with you.

11:08.513 --> 11:10.313
She was not!

11:10.415 --> 11:12.582
Louise and I enjoy talking to each other

11:12.617 --> 11:15.685
about back in the day, and that's it.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.086
You're 1,000 years old.

11:17.155 --> 11:18.521
You know what I'm talking about.

11:23.094 --> 11:24.561
Hey. Look what I found.

11:24.629 --> 11:26.763
- Oh, nice. Thanks.
- No. Not so fast.

11:26.832 --> 11:28.731
A police officer said
you left it in his car.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.467
You want to explain that?

11:30.535 --> 11:32.402
Oh.

11:32.504 --> 11:34.103
You really want to know?

11:34.206 --> 11:35.438
I'm dating a cop.

11:38.777 --> 11:41.311
Wow. You go down swinging.
I'll give you that.

11:42.948 --> 11:44.380
You are grounded for three weeks.

11:44.483 --> 11:45.849
Oh, come on!

11:45.951 --> 11:47.684
Harris, is this what
your life is gonna be now...

11:47.752 --> 11:49.486
drinking in the woods
with a bunch of idiots?

11:49.588 --> 11:51.621
My friends aren't idiots.

11:51.690 --> 11:53.156
And this is a ridiculous overreaction

11:53.258 --> 11:54.591
for a couple of beers.

11:54.659 --> 11:56.793
Harris, you are underage.

11:56.862 --> 11:58.628
You cannot have <i> any</i> beers.

11:58.697 --> 12:00.230
Get off my back.

12:00.332 --> 12:01.264
I'm getting good grades,

12:01.333 --> 12:03.566
and I scored really high on my ACTs.

12:03.635 --> 12:05.034
It's not like I'm doing heroin.

12:05.103 --> 12:07.237
It doesn't matter how smart you are.
Don't you get it?

12:07.305 --> 12:09.539
A few wrong moves,
and you're screwed for life.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.207
You want to end up like your Aunt Becky?

12:15.947 --> 12:17.514
Was Becky in the house?

12:19.551 --> 12:21.017
She was doing laundry.

12:21.119 --> 12:23.753
Damn it! And I almost said
"Like your Uncle DJ."

12:27.841 --> 12:28.976
Can we just sit and talk

12:29.066 --> 12:32.433
like regular freakin' people
just for a minute?

12:32.489 --> 12:34.207
I can't do this anymore.

12:34.246 --> 12:37.792
I'm cooking, I'm cleaning,
I'm making sacrifices to Odin.

12:37.861 --> 12:40.825
I haven't had a decent
night's sleep or a meal

12:40.895 --> 12:44.302
that my body knows how
to digest in four days.

12:44.373 --> 12:45.739
It's been hard on both of us,

12:45.807 --> 12:47.640
but it's gonna make such a great paper.

12:47.709 --> 12:49.809
Yeah, but I have to actually
go out and strip a tree

12:49.878 --> 12:51.678
in the park to make that paper.

12:51.747 --> 12:54.814
This... is not working for me.

12:54.894 --> 12:55.949
What are you talking about?

12:56.051 --> 12:59.152
Look, I don't mind paying your tuition,

12:59.221 --> 13:00.987
I don't mind running your errands,

13:01.056 --> 13:02.422
and I don't mind doing
all the housework.

13:02.524 --> 13:05.625
What I'm trying to say is I <i> do</i> mind.

13:05.694 --> 13:07.560
I mind it all.

13:07.629 --> 13:10.330
You knew that I was finishing
this degree when you met me.

13:10.399 --> 13:11.998
And now when I'm under
the most pressure,

13:12.067 --> 13:13.633
you insinuate that
I'm not bringing anything

13:13.702 --> 13:14.768
to the relationship.

13:14.836 --> 13:16.503
I'm not insinuating anything.

13:16.571 --> 13:18.938
I'm outright telling you.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.140
What do you want me to do?

13:20.208 --> 13:21.641
Uh, wash a dish.

13:21.710 --> 13:23.543
Run the vacuum cleaner.

13:23.612 --> 13:24.978
Ask me how my day is going.

13:25.046 --> 13:27.747
Chip in every once in a while
for expenses.

13:27.849 --> 13:30.016
Look, I'll t... I'll tell you what.

13:30.085 --> 13:32.085
In a month, when I finish
writing up this paper,

13:32.154 --> 13:34.220
I'll do all those things and more.

13:34.256 --> 13:35.789
But right now, why don't you take

13:35.891 --> 13:38.091
all that frustration out on the dough

13:38.193 --> 13:39.726
and make the bread for tomorrow?

13:39.828 --> 13:42.095
Well...

13:42.130 --> 13:44.898
I would, but I just got dragged away

13:44.966 --> 13:47.500
by a wild boar, and I'm dead.

13:47.602 --> 13:49.502
So while you mourn me,

13:49.571 --> 13:52.739
my Viking soul
is gonna be at McDonald's.

13:56.211 --> 13:57.477
What am I doing? I can't wear this.

13:57.546 --> 13:58.812
I'll look like an idiot.

14:03.452 --> 14:04.684
Hey. Ready to go?

14:04.753 --> 14:06.820
Yep. Just clocked out.

14:06.888 --> 14:10.123
I got the tickets, I got
the cushions for the seats,

14:10.192 --> 14:12.759
and a little surprise
we can all pass around.

14:13.829 --> 14:16.329
Is it a football?

14:16.398 --> 14:19.833
No, but it's as big as a football.

14:19.935 --> 14:21.000
Sounds good.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.469
Oh, your friends need a ride,

14:22.537 --> 14:23.670
or are they meeting us there?

14:23.738 --> 14:26.039
Um, they're gonna go on their own.

14:26.107 --> 14:28.074
I just figured that we might want to

14:28.143 --> 14:30.343
do something together after...

14:30.445 --> 14:31.878
just the two of us.

14:33.815 --> 14:36.249
If that's all right with you.

14:38.753 --> 14:41.287
Can we maybe sit for a minute?

14:41.389 --> 14:42.622
Sure.

14:44.993 --> 14:46.860
Oh.

14:48.530 --> 14:50.029
Ah.

14:50.098 --> 14:53.299
This is crazy, but I have to ask.

14:53.368 --> 14:55.902
Becky and Jackie think that
you're interested in me

14:55.971 --> 14:59.072
in more than a just shooting-
the-breeze kind of way.

14:59.174 --> 15:00.106
Are you serious?

15:00.208 --> 15:01.808
Yeah. Crazy, right?

15:01.877 --> 15:03.042
No.

15:03.144 --> 15:05.712
I mean, I can't believe
you didn't pick up on it.

15:09.784 --> 15:11.651
Every time you walk in here,

15:11.720 --> 15:14.487
I am staring at you like
you're a deep-dish pizza.

15:16.191 --> 15:18.458
Let me help you figure it out.

15:18.527 --> 15:21.628
We're both free, we like each other,

15:21.696 --> 15:24.731
I've had a crush on you since I was 15,

15:24.766 --> 15:27.567
but Roseanne already
had her brand on you.

15:27.669 --> 15:30.370
Well, she didn't actually brand me.

15:30.438 --> 15:32.972
But there are some bruises
that'll never go away.

15:35.110 --> 15:38.811
Um, look, I'm just not ready for this.

15:38.914 --> 15:40.079
Oh.

15:42.017 --> 15:44.617
Anything I can do to change your mind?

15:44.719 --> 15:46.219
I'm afraid not.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.956
I still have a thing for my wife.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.360
Look, Louise.

15:56.264 --> 15:59.065
I really enjoy your company,

15:59.134 --> 16:00.466
and I hope it's not gonna be weird

16:00.569 --> 16:02.835
now that we're just friends.

16:02.938 --> 16:04.571
Well...

16:04.606 --> 16:06.406
the free beers are over.

16:08.777 --> 16:10.376
I was... I was really hoping

16:10.445 --> 16:14.414
that I could get
a little action for that.

16:14.516 --> 16:15.848
We still going to the concert?

16:15.951 --> 16:17.250
Of course.

16:17.285 --> 16:21.955
But if I have a chance to score
with a Dog Night or a Pip,

16:22.057 --> 16:24.290
you better get out of my way.

16:24.392 --> 16:26.492
- Deal.
- Deal.

16:26.561 --> 16:29.918
<i>♪ Why don't you love me like
you used to do? ♪</i>

16:30.799 --> 16:32.699
How'd you know I was here?

16:32.767 --> 16:35.435
I know you like to
play pool when you're upset,

16:35.470 --> 16:37.403
and, um, we need to talk.

16:37.472 --> 16:40.106
No, we don't.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.842
You were pretty clear.

16:42.911 --> 16:44.811
Well, I was angry at Harris,

16:44.913 --> 16:46.613
and I was angry at <i> you.</i>

16:46.681 --> 16:49.115
I mean, you know that you
should've told me what happened.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.117
I told her not to drink.

16:51.186 --> 16:52.986
But no matter what I did,

16:53.088 --> 16:56.623
it doesn't change what
you really think of me.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.124
Okay, w... uh, you know, I said it.

16:58.193 --> 16:59.525
I can't take it back, so, you know,

16:59.628 --> 17:00.960
what do you want me to do?

17:01.062 --> 17:02.795
When all this crap went down

17:02.864 --> 17:04.564
about my drinking and the baby,

17:04.633 --> 17:06.465
and you said you believed in me

17:06.534 --> 17:08.835
and that I could get
through this, I thought,

17:08.903 --> 17:11.838
"Maybe I'm not as messed up
as I think I am."

17:11.906 --> 17:13.239
But then I heard what you said,

17:13.308 --> 17:15.074
and now I know
that you were lying to me,

17:15.175 --> 17:16.576
and that hurts.

17:16.645 --> 17:18.077
No, I was not lying.

17:18.179 --> 17:19.679
I <i> do</i> believe in you now.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.114
But are you gonna
stand there and tell me

17:21.182 --> 17:24.349
you haven't made some really
crappy choices in your life?

17:24.452 --> 17:27.153
It's so easy for you to criticize now,

17:27.222 --> 17:29.522
but where were you
when I was making them?

17:29.591 --> 17:31.257
What's that supposed to mean?

17:31.359 --> 17:34.494
When do you think
the heavy drinking started?

17:34.596 --> 17:36.129
When Mark died, I needed you.

17:36.197 --> 17:38.898
I wrote to you and asked you to come.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.401
Well, my life was falling apart, too.

17:41.469 --> 17:43.569
My husband just left me
with a 5-year-old kid,

17:43.672 --> 17:45.071
and I was pregnant.

17:45.173 --> 17:47.674
My husband died.

17:52.914 --> 17:54.380
Okay.

17:54.482 --> 17:55.481
You win.

17:57.318 --> 17:58.918
I did send you that care package

17:58.987 --> 18:01.654
filled with crossword puzzles and candy.

18:01.690 --> 18:03.723
Oh, yeah, those crossword puzzles

18:03.825 --> 18:06.159
really helped.

18:06.194 --> 18:08.094
It was nice to get away from being sad

18:08.163 --> 18:09.962
and feel stupid for a while.

18:11.866 --> 18:13.299
Hey, you want to play a game?

18:13.368 --> 18:15.301
Oh, don't waste your time.
She's pregnant.

18:15.403 --> 18:16.703
And she's nasty.

18:18.740 --> 18:20.139
I'm up for either.

18:22.510 --> 18:23.643
Gross.

18:25.246 --> 18:28.181
Pick up a damn cue
so no one comes over again.

18:29.417 --> 18:31.784
And you go first because you suck.

18:33.254 --> 18:36.089
I mean as a person,
not only as a pool player.

18:37.292 --> 18:38.925
How come you didn't tell me
you were so mad

18:39.027 --> 18:40.960
when it was all happening?

18:41.029 --> 18:44.363
Because I didn't want you
to know how much I needed you.

18:44.466 --> 18:45.765
Why?

18:45.867 --> 18:48.801
Because you never need me.

18:48.903 --> 18:50.503
I hate being the needy one.

18:50.572 --> 18:52.905
When we were kids, I was the one
who had it all together,

18:52.974 --> 18:56.509
and you were just
the depressed little freak.

18:56.578 --> 18:58.277
Well, you should be in pig heaven now

18:58.379 --> 19:00.079
because I'm a depressed adult freak

19:00.181 --> 19:02.415
with just as many problems as you.

19:04.419 --> 19:06.152
And...

19:06.221 --> 19:09.322
you know, you think I don't need you?

19:09.390 --> 19:12.125
Why do you think I came back
here in the first place?

19:12.227 --> 19:14.694
Not just for Mom and Dad.

19:14.796 --> 19:16.095
Really?

19:16.164 --> 19:19.332
You can't do that. You're not 4.

19:19.434 --> 19:20.767
Oh, my God.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.235
How many times did I let you

19:22.337 --> 19:24.270
move the ball in miniature golf?

19:29.010 --> 19:32.111
There is no way to miss that shot.

19:32.180 --> 19:34.347
You should get a brain scan immediately.

19:35.350 --> 19:37.784
So...

19:37.886 --> 19:39.085
where do we go from here?

19:40.288 --> 19:42.221
Besides making jokes about brain tumors

19:42.323 --> 19:44.824
when somebody misses
a very difficult shot.

19:46.494 --> 19:48.995
We make a pact to always
be there for each other.

19:50.498 --> 19:51.898
Oh, pact seems a little binding.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.802
How about a... loose agreement?

19:55.904 --> 19:56.969
Fine.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.472
But just for the record,
you needed me first.

19:59.574 --> 20:02.475
When Mom and Dad brought you
home from the hospital,

20:02.577 --> 20:05.411
I remember seeing
your sweet, little face

20:05.513 --> 20:08.815
and knowing that you really
needed me to protect you.

20:08.917 --> 20:13.219
Wait. Mom told me you tried
to kill me when I was a baby.

20:13.321 --> 20:16.122
Yeah, but something stopped me.

20:16.224 --> 20:17.690
I think it was Dad.

20:21.745 --> 20:23.534
You know, you really got to learn

20:23.573 --> 20:25.973
how to read the signals that
a woman is sending you.

20:26.041 --> 20:28.642
Like, if a woman does this...

20:29.927 --> 20:31.693
Huh? What does that mean?

20:31.748 --> 20:33.581
You want me to check you for ticks.

20:33.683 --> 20:35.372
No!

20:35.919 --> 20:37.786
She's drawing attention to her neck.

20:37.869 --> 20:38.887
You got to know these things.

20:38.955 --> 20:40.722
Say you're sitting at a bar,

20:40.824 --> 20:42.657
and a woman eats a chip like this.

20:44.048 --> 20:45.093
She's not interested.

20:45.165 --> 20:47.629
Now, if she eats a chip like this...

20:53.003 --> 20:55.236
That means you're gonna
be really unhappy

20:55.338 --> 20:57.739
when you hear that Mary
brought those chips back in

20:57.841 --> 20:58.773
from the chicken coop.

20:58.875 --> 21:00.508
Oh! Oh!

21:00.610 --> 21:02.110
Oh, God!
