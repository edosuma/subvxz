You're the next one, man.

01:05:00.813 --> 01:05:04.316
Somehow, Flight 180,
are they still in flight?

Somewhere, are they safe?

01:05:10.781 --> 01:05:14.701
When I was a kid, like 6 or 7...

01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:17.495
...I used to worry so much
about my parents dying.

01:05:30.843 --> 01:05:34.512
When I was 10,
my dad went into a 7-Eleven for cigarettes.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.182
I guess that he heard someone say,
"Don't turn around."

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:40.685
So on reflex, or thinking
it was a friend joking, he did.

01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:43.647
And the guy blew his head off.

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:47.192
Life became shit after that.

01:05:48.027 --> 01:05:50.904
My mom just couldn't deal anymore.

She married this asshole...

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:57.702
...who my mom with my real dad would
have crossed the street to avoid this guy.

01:05:58.037 --> 01:06:01.873
He really didn't want a kid.
So my mom didn't either anymore.

for my father and my family...

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:10.298

and my dad are still together...
