1:09:30.833 --> 1:09:33.416
-Need a little help with that?
-I've got it.

1:09:33.500 --> 1:09:35.625
I… I think you have to push the latch.

1:09:37.333 --> 1:09:38.750
[Ms. Johnston] Come on.

1:09:39.458 --> 1:09:41.916
-[Jeronicus] Good job.
-[sighs]

1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.916
Mrs. Johnston? It's just that
I need this taken care of today.

1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:48.875
-Happy holidays, Jerry.
-I'm going out of business, Mrs. Johnston.

1:09:48.958 --> 1:09:52.458
-It's supposed to start snowing. [laughs]
-I'm closing the shop in a few days.

1:09:53.041 --> 1:09:55.750
-How about a time?
-I hear your granddaughter's down.

1:09:55.833 --> 1:09:59.833
Oh! Grandchildren are like children,
only you can give them back.

1:09:59.916 --> 1:10:02.500
-Could you give me a time of day?
-[chuckling]

1:10:03.250 --> 1:10:04.791
-Just… No.
-I'll just--

1:10:04.875 --> 1:10:07.916
It's fine, Jerry. I've got it.

-[chuckles] Thank you, Jerry.

1:10:11.708 --> 1:10:14.875
-You'll come by, though, right?
-Here we go. Of course, Jerry!

1:10:14.958 --> 1:10:17.000

-Mrs. Johnston!

1:10:21.416 --> 1:10:24.291
I have to be out by Christmas.
That's tomorrow!

-Jeronicus!

1:10:26.583 --> 1:10:28.375

Of course. He's probably
out there somewhere having fun.

1:14:29.500 --> 1:14:32.458
Gustafson started bragging
that he was the greatest inventor,

-and the professor hadn't--
-Edison, tell me you didn't.

1:14:36.041 --> 1:14:37.416
I'm the worst apprentice ever.

1:14:37.500 --> 1:14:40.666
I mean, you're a bad apprentice,
but not even close to how bad I am.

-Buddy!
-Ow! I'm okay.

or think you can't, you're right.

[Edison] What does that even mean?

1:15:42.166 --> 1:15:45.041
The buyers are here? Again?

your lesson from the last time?

No bother. I'll just walk.

…instead of copper cogs.

-Why are you back here?

1:19:53.625 --> 1:19:58.333
[Ms. Johnston] Well, you see, I, uh…
I forgot to deliver these, didn't I?

1:19:58.416 --> 1:20:00.000
Oh! Silly me.

You're doing great, Edison!

Who cares?

1:20:45.500 --> 1:20:47.833
It's a failed invention. Let 'em have it.

1:20:49.291 --> 1:20:53.333
If it were failed, then why
would they be trying to recover it?

1:20:53.833 --> 1:20:55.083
They wouldn't!
