00:20.634 --> 00:23.733
Pay new bills
or price old furniture?

00:23.800 --> 00:25.234
Uh... furniture.

00:25.301 --> 00:26.668
You know,
i cannot believe

00:26.733 --> 00:28.501
you're canceling
drinks with
my brother.

00:28.568 --> 00:29.934
Whoa, not canceling.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.167
I changed the location
to linda's on the square,
ok?

00:32.234 --> 00:34.301
I want mitch
to see your house.

00:34.334 --> 00:36.067
I don't know what
you're so worried
about.

00:36.134 --> 00:37.367
Melinda:
We can't have visitors.

00:37.434 --> 00:39.201
We haven't had a chance
to clean up.

00:40.967 --> 00:43.700
Ah, the man
sells real estate
for a living.

00:43.767 --> 00:46.201
He sees all the secrets
of people's homes.

00:46.267 --> 00:48.201
Rich people.
People who have
maids.

00:48.267 --> 00:50.034
Didn't you just say
he was once named

00:50.100 --> 00:53.067
one of
the 30 millionaires
under 30 to watch?

00:53.134 --> 00:54.700
Actually, it was 25
out of 25,

00:54.767 --> 00:56.201
but who's counting?

00:56.267 --> 00:58.534
Ah, melinda, you should
see their penthouse
in the city.

00:58.601 --> 01:00.534
And their summer house
at the beach.

01:00.601 --> 01:02.267
His wife, maya,
the ex-model...

01:02.334 --> 01:03.334
i know.

01:03.401 --> 01:04.534
She decorated them
both,

01:04.601 --> 01:06.534
and she has, of course,
impeccable taste.

01:06.601 --> 01:10.467
Ok. Your brother's
definitely never stepping
foot in my house.

01:10.534 --> 01:12.034
What are you talking
about?

01:12.100 --> 01:14.534
You guys are almost
done renovating.
Your house is beautiful!

01:14.601 --> 01:15.867
Would you mind
telling that to jim?

01:15.934 --> 01:17.867
Because he now wants
to repaint every room.

01:17.934 --> 01:21.234
I swear he likes to live
in a perpetual state
of construction.

01:24.867 --> 01:27.034
Actually, you know what?
I better run.

01:27.100 --> 01:29.733
'Cause i told mitch
i was gonna pick him up
at the hotel.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.334
So he's not staying
at your apartment?

01:31.401 --> 01:33.167
He's way too rich
to sleep on my couch.

01:33.234 --> 01:35.167
Yeah. And to have drinks
on mine.

01:35.234 --> 01:37.167
Well, too bad, 'cause
mean old moneybags

01:37.234 --> 01:39.100
is gonna be
on your porch at 9:00.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.301
Bye.
Bye.

03:23.707 --> 03:26.841
I started calling andrea
a squeaky wheel
when we were kids.

03:26.908 --> 03:29.641
I would follow him
around everywhere
and talk constantly

03:29.707 --> 03:32.707
like a squeaky wheel,
and he couldn't get
a word in edgewise.

03:32.774 --> 03:35.841
How's my little sister
doing at your store?

03:35.908 --> 03:37.541
Andrea: Our store.
Our store.

03:37.607 --> 03:38.973
She owns half.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.507
We're partners.
I... told you that.

03:41.574 --> 03:43.774
You did, but i wasn't sure
whether this was a vocation

03:43.841 --> 03:46.007
or another one of your
avocations.

03:46.073 --> 03:48.307
Yes. I am the perpetual
student.

03:48.374 --> 03:50.240
I did actually
manage to learn

03:50.307 --> 03:51.541
quite a bit of latin,
though.

03:54.641 --> 03:56.707
What was that?

03:56.774 --> 03:58.107
You guys all right?

04:00.741 --> 04:03.841
Uh... i was meaning
to replace these frames.

04:03.908 --> 04:06.541
I can understand
why you'd want to keep
the original wood.

04:06.607 --> 04:08.774
I mean, you can't beat
that quality of craftsmanship.

04:08.841 --> 04:10.140
Yeah, tim did

04:10.207 --> 04:11.774
andrea and melinda:
All the renovations
himself.

04:13.808 --> 04:15.274
So what are your plans
for this house?

04:15.340 --> 04:18.007
Besides living in it?

04:18.072 --> 04:21.607
I been thinking about
repainting all the rooms.

04:21.673 --> 04:22.808
Why do you ask?

04:22.874 --> 04:24.607
If i had a house like this,
i'd flip it.

04:24.674 --> 04:26.707
With the remodeling
that jim's already done,

04:26.774 --> 04:29.741
put this back on the market
for 6 or $700,000.

04:29.808 --> 04:31.107
That much.

04:31.174 --> 04:33.040
If you guys are interested,
i could show you how.

04:33.107 --> 04:34.841
You could end up with
a much bigger and better place.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.441
It couldn't hurt
to find out, right?

05:12.908 --> 05:14.741
What are you doing
here?

05:14.808 --> 05:16.574
This is my home.

05:16.641 --> 05:18.407
Who are you?

05:28.140 --> 05:30.841
Is that you?

05:30.908 --> 05:33.240
Are you dead, too?

05:33.307 --> 05:34.841
Uh, no.
[Small laugh]

05:38.140 --> 05:40.407
What is that?

05:40.474 --> 05:43.441
It's your energy.
You have a lot of
pent-up anger,

05:43.507 --> 05:47.140
and i would calm down
before you short out
the whole block.

05:49.073 --> 05:50.474
Yeah, that's me.

05:50.541 --> 05:52.808
With my mother.
I have to talk to her.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.040
Where is she?

05:54.107 --> 05:56.407
I'm not even sure
where i am.

05:56.474 --> 05:58.240
Jim:
Melinda.

05:58.307 --> 05:59.240
Oh...

05:59.307 --> 06:00.240
friend or foe?

06:00.307 --> 06:01.374
Friend. I think.

06:01.441 --> 06:03.507
Be up in a minute.

06:20.174 --> 06:21.040
Hi.

06:21.107 --> 06:22.040
Hi!

06:22.107 --> 06:23.507
You're outside
the store.

06:23.574 --> 06:25.007
Yes, i am.
Why?

06:25.073 --> 06:27.407
Because inside the store,
it's gotten a little
creepy.

06:27.474 --> 06:30.541
No offense if it's like
a friend of yours
or something.

06:30.607 --> 06:33.808
I just thought i'd enjoy
the day out here
until you came.

06:33.874 --> 06:34.808
My friend.

06:34.874 --> 06:36.007
Yeah.
Right.

06:46.207 --> 06:48.174
What's all my furniture
doing here?

06:48.240 --> 06:51.174
I bought it
at an estate sale.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.174
What's your name?

06:53.240 --> 06:54.741
Jason. Jason shields.

06:54.808 --> 06:56.674
How come you can
see me and hear me?

06:56.741 --> 06:58.874
It's this thing.
It's complicated.

06:58.940 --> 07:01.808
The best part is
that i can help you
cross over.

07:01.874 --> 07:03.707
I mean, you really
don't want to stay here.

07:03.774 --> 07:05.908
You need to get
to the next place.

07:05.973 --> 07:09.007
No. I don't wanna
go anywhere until
i find my mother.

07:09.073 --> 07:10.307
Picture.

07:12.741 --> 07:15.240
See the tattoo
on her arm?

07:15.307 --> 07:16.707
And if you look
real close,

07:16.774 --> 07:19.340
you can see that she
bites her fingernails.

07:19.407 --> 07:20.707
What's her name?

07:20.774 --> 07:21.940
I don't know.

07:22.007 --> 07:24.073
I don't know what
she looks like,

07:24.140 --> 07:25.641
where she lives,
or anything about her.

07:25.707 --> 07:27.808
The last time
i was with her was when
we took that picture.

07:27.874 --> 07:29.541
I was only a day old.

07:29.607 --> 07:31.607
So she put you up
for adoption.

07:31.674 --> 07:34.641
I was gonna start
looking for her as soon
as i turned 18,

07:34.707 --> 07:36.741
'cause then my mom and dad
couldn't stop me.

07:36.808 --> 07:38.207
Your adoptive parents.

07:38.274 --> 07:40.940
So... what happened?

07:41.007 --> 07:44.174
I would have been
18 this week.

07:46.908 --> 07:49.107
How did you find out
you were adopted?

07:53.574 --> 07:56.307
My mom and dad were moving
grandma into a nursing home.

07:56.374 --> 07:58.541
Her mind was starting to go.

07:58.607 --> 08:01.507
I found the picture.

08:01.574 --> 08:04.741
I asked my grandmother
who the baby was,

08:04.808 --> 08:07.808
and she said it was me
with my mother,

08:07.874 --> 08:10.274
except my mother
doesn't have a tattoo.

08:10.340 --> 08:12.808
That's when i knew.

08:18.207 --> 08:20.174
If you won't
tell me who she is,
i'm gonna find her!

08:20.240 --> 08:22.707
Mother: I don't know
who she is.
She abandoned you!

08:22.774 --> 08:25.140
How do you know what happened?
I'm gonna find my mother!

08:25.207 --> 08:27.474
I am your mother!

08:27.541 --> 08:30.874
They denied it.
And then they weren't even
gonna talk about it.

08:35.174 --> 08:37.972
They weren't even gonna
tell me that i was adopted.

09:31.541 --> 09:33.674
I'm sorry.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.707
I can't go anywhere
until i find my mother.

09:35.774 --> 09:37.741
I have to know why
she gave me up.

09:37.808 --> 09:39.607
Maybe if i talk to
your adopted mother...

09:39.674 --> 09:41.741
no! She won't help.

09:41.808 --> 09:43.407
Even if she could.

09:43.474 --> 09:45.707
She'll have nothing
to do with this.

09:48.707 --> 09:50.574
Will you help me?

09:54.808 --> 09:56.741
You know these adoption
searches take years,

09:56.808 --> 09:58.374
and that's with
some information,

09:58.441 --> 10:00.707
and you don't know
anything about
this woman.

10:00.774 --> 10:03.407
Not true. I know
that she bites her nails,

10:03.474 --> 10:04.908
and i know that
she has a tattoo.

10:04.973 --> 10:06.407
Can you imagine
finding out

10:06.474 --> 10:08.674
that your parents
are not your parents?

10:08.741 --> 10:12.641
Sounds like
every angst-ridden
teenager's dream.

10:12.707 --> 10:14.441
I know it was mine.

10:14.507 --> 10:18.441
Yeah, mine, too.
But the reality
must be devastating.

10:18.507 --> 10:23.073
This is jason's only connection
to the woman who gave him life.

10:23.140 --> 10:25.040
No wonder
he's attached to it.

10:25.107 --> 10:27.140
Wait.
That's haliston county.

10:27.207 --> 10:30.874
See?
She's got a hospital
i.d. Bracelet on.

10:30.940 --> 10:32.474
I can't see the name,

10:32.541 --> 10:34.541
but that's the symbol
for haliston county
hospital.

10:34.607 --> 10:36.140
Are you sure?

10:36.207 --> 10:38.007
Yeah. We had
a resident from mercy
just take a job there.

10:38.073 --> 10:40.474
So that's where
jason was born.

10:40.541 --> 10:42.174
I'm off work
tomorrow.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.274
Me, too.

10:44.340 --> 10:46.507
Well...

10:46.574 --> 10:48.140
now that
that's solved...

10:54.707 --> 10:57.574
someday we'll have
one of our own.

10:57.641 --> 10:59.741
I'm thinking
more like 4 or 5.

10:59.808 --> 11:01.340
Ouch!

11:01.407 --> 11:03.240
We definitely need
a bigger house.

11:03.307 --> 11:04.973
Jimbo!

11:05.040 --> 11:05.973
Hey!

11:06.040 --> 11:07.774
Hey, good to see you
again.

11:07.841 --> 11:10.808
Dennis nakamura.
Hey, meet my wife,
melinda gordon.

11:10.874 --> 11:12.140
Hi. I really appreciate

11:12.207 --> 11:14.274
your help
in finding my friend's
birth records.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.908
No problem.

11:15.973 --> 11:18.973
Maybe i can
ask you for a favor
in return.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.940
This is where we keep
babies that have been
abandoned

11:21.007 --> 11:22.973
or are being put up
for adoption.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.741
This is where jason
must have been
after he was born.

11:25.808 --> 11:27.240
You ever heard of
f.t.t.?

11:27.307 --> 11:29.874
Yeah. It's a failure
to thrive.

11:29.940 --> 11:31.874
It's a condition
babies develop

11:31.940 --> 11:33.874
due to emotional
neglect.

11:33.940 --> 11:37.474
Yeah. Basically,
if an infant isn't
being held enough,

11:37.541 --> 11:41.474
looked at, touched,
or given enough
emotional attention,

11:41.541 --> 11:43.574
it stops growing.

11:43.641 --> 11:45.607
That's why we get
volunteers like yourself

11:45.674 --> 11:47.407
to come in
and hold them.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.541
Oh... hi, little one.

11:51.007 --> 11:52.407
While you're doing
that,

11:52.474 --> 11:54.574
we'll look for
your adopted friend's
birth records.

12:00.374 --> 12:02.240
Adoption, huh?

12:02.307 --> 12:03.641
Tricky business.

12:03.707 --> 12:05.541
Although,
from what i've learned
over the years,

12:05.607 --> 12:06.641
you can always count
on the courts

12:06.707 --> 12:09.307
to have adoption
records on file.

12:09.374 --> 12:11.541
Getting to see them
is another matter.

12:11.607 --> 12:13.641
What are you doing here?

12:13.707 --> 12:14.940
Waiting.

12:16.274 --> 12:17.841
Won't be long now.

12:17.908 --> 12:20.507
Oh, is this one yours?

12:20.574 --> 12:23.641
She will be soon.

12:23.707 --> 12:27.040
I don't understand.

12:27.107 --> 12:29.774
I have a calling,
just like you.

12:29.841 --> 12:32.774
I'm a guardian
for little children
who don't have anyone

12:32.841 --> 12:35.240
to meet them
on the other side.

12:35.307 --> 12:36.474
I take care of them.

12:38.607 --> 12:40.107
So, she isn't
gonna make it?

12:40.174 --> 12:44.940
It's ok. She's not
meant to make it.

12:45.007 --> 12:46.908
We have a better place
for her.
[Monitor beeping]

12:46.973 --> 12:48.441
Time for us to go.

13:03.374 --> 13:05.441
Waiting in line
is worse than
being dead.

13:07.641 --> 13:09.073
Why are you
ignoring me?!

13:09.140 --> 13:11.507
I'm not. I just can't
talk with all these
people around.

13:13.073 --> 13:17.240
Ok, miss gordon.
I found jason shields'
adoption records.

13:17.307 --> 13:19.140
Uh, do you have
a judge's signed order
for a release?

13:19.207 --> 13:21.741
Not yet. I just need
to know if the record
is complete.

13:21.808 --> 13:24.307
Oh, i can't let you look
at it without a release.

13:29.741 --> 13:31.240
What do you
want me to do?

13:31.307 --> 13:32.774
Are you ok, miss?

13:32.841 --> 13:34.507
Stand behind the counter.

13:34.574 --> 13:36.574
I <i>am</i> behind
the counter.

13:36.641 --> 13:39.407
That's what i meant,
like that.

13:39.474 --> 13:41.174
You know, you wouldn't
be breaking any rules

13:41.240 --> 13:44.107
if you just told me
that the documents
were all there.

13:44.174 --> 13:46.441
Well, what kind of documents
are we looking for today?

13:46.507 --> 13:48.874
Well, can you list
what's there?

13:48.940 --> 13:52.641
Petition to adopt,
finalization papers,

13:52.707 --> 13:55.574
adoption consent...
get her to slow down.
I can't see anything.

13:55.641 --> 13:59.574
Could you slow down,
just for a minute?

13:59.641 --> 14:03.441
All right, here's something
that says my mother was 17,
italian-catholic,

14:03.507 --> 14:06.040
unmarried.
That's it. That's it?

14:06.107 --> 14:07.340
Is there anything else?

14:07.407 --> 14:11.174
Only the orders
to terminate
parental rights.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.340
No, this can't be right.

14:13.407 --> 14:14.774
Melinda: What is it?

14:14.841 --> 14:16.307
Dissolves
the birth parents

14:16.374 --> 14:18.707
from any legal right
to the child.

14:18.774 --> 14:20.073
Right.

14:21.407 --> 14:23.140
Are you ok?

14:24.908 --> 14:26.441
She gave me up
willingly.

14:26.507 --> 14:28.207
I thought she had to
give me away. L...

14:28.274 --> 14:30.541
i thought someone
was forcing her.

14:32.541 --> 14:34.674
My mother didn't want me.

14:43.974 --> 14:47.607
she gave me away
when i was a day old.
What's wrong with me?

14:47.673 --> 14:51.408
Nothing. We don't know
what her situation was.

14:51.474 --> 14:56.307
I can't tell you how many
hours i studied that picture
looking for clues.

14:56.374 --> 14:59.441
I was psyched she had a tattoo.
I mean, how cool is that?

14:59.508 --> 15:02.774
And the fingernails.

15:02.840 --> 15:06.341
I figured they were bitten down
'cause she was all upset
about having to give me away,

15:06.408 --> 15:11.141
like, maybe she was too young
and her parents were forcing
her to give me up.

15:11.207 --> 15:12.940
Pretty stupid, huh?

15:13.007 --> 15:16.874
"Willingly relinquished"
is just a legal term.

15:16.940 --> 15:19.107
We don't know what
other kind of battles
she was fighting.

15:19.174 --> 15:22.974
I don't know who i am...
or who i was.

15:23.041 --> 15:25.673
Hey, i know
how hard this is,

15:25.740 --> 15:29.374
but you're forgetting
about the 2 people
who did want you.

15:29.441 --> 15:31.508
They chose you,
they loved you,
they raised you.

15:31.573 --> 15:33.974
You don't keep secrets
from people you love!

15:34.041 --> 15:37.874
How could they not tell me?
How could they let me
find out like that?

15:37.940 --> 15:40.874
Let's ask.
I can't.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.041
I don't wanna talk to her.

15:43.107 --> 15:44.807
If we're gonna find
your birth mother,

15:44.874 --> 15:47.508
i have to see
if they know anything
that can help us.

15:47.573 --> 15:49.940
Can't you just, like,
read minds and stuff?

15:50.007 --> 15:52.441
Can't you just
look into the past
and see what happened?

15:52.508 --> 15:55.441
No. I'm not
a fortune teller,
and i'm not a psychic.

15:55.508 --> 15:58.974
I have my hands full
as it is, believe me.

16:00.408 --> 16:02.874
Where can i find
your mother?

16:08.740 --> 16:10.707
Hi. I'm looking
for diane shields.

16:10.774 --> 16:11.874
Look no further.

16:11.940 --> 16:14.074
You found her.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.707
My name's
melinda gordon.

16:16.774 --> 16:19.374
I'm a friend
of jason's.

16:21.974 --> 16:23.907
Forgive me for being
so blunt,

16:23.974 --> 16:26.907
but there's really
no easy way to say this.

16:26.974 --> 16:28.874
Jason's passed away.

16:28.940 --> 16:31.508
Last year. I know.
I'm very sorry.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.807
Has it been a year
already?

16:33.874 --> 16:36.141
Shoot. I've got
something in my eye.

16:36.207 --> 16:38.874
Um... excuse me
for a minute, would ya?

16:48.840 --> 16:51.441
I plant trees for him.

16:51.508 --> 16:54.441
I planted one
at the high school,
one at the skateboard park,

16:54.508 --> 16:56.441
and 2 in the girls'
soccer field.

16:56.508 --> 16:58.441
It's a beautiful
thing to do.

16:58.508 --> 17:00.807
What can i do for you,
melinda?

17:02.374 --> 17:06.473
Well, this isn't
such an easy thing
to say either. Um...

17:08.107 --> 17:10.207
i've seen jason.

17:10.273 --> 17:11.773
I spoke with him
this morning.

17:11.839 --> 17:13.573
I have an antique
store in grandview,

17:13.640 --> 17:15.940
and somehow i ended up
with jason's furniture.

17:16.007 --> 17:17.874
You've seen jason?

17:17.940 --> 17:19.906
Spirits are sometimes
very attached to their
personal things,

17:19.973 --> 17:21.473
furniture, jewelry.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.773
You're talking about
ghosts.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.740
I can see them.
And help them.

17:26.508 --> 17:29.540
Oh, my dear girl.

17:29.607 --> 17:32.540
People say i have
a twisted sense of humor,

17:32.607 --> 17:37.074
but <i>this</i> is in incredible
bad taste, even for me.

17:37.141 --> 17:38.441
Who put you up
to this?

17:38.508 --> 17:40.974
I found a picture
of him when he was
a baby

17:41.041 --> 17:42.441
with his real mother,
and...

17:42.508 --> 17:44.640
i'm his real mother.
Who in the hell are you?

17:44.707 --> 17:46.174
Sorry. I didn't
mean it that way.

17:46.241 --> 17:47.441
I really took him home
from the hospital,

17:47.508 --> 17:49.408
and i was really there
when he was crying

17:49.474 --> 17:50.907
and when he was laughing,

17:50.974 --> 17:53.007
and i really lived through
his loud music.

17:53.074 --> 17:55.673
And then i really
had to bury him,

17:55.740 --> 17:58.640
and now i have to endure
a very real silence

17:58.707 --> 18:01.640
because the crying
and laughter and music
has stopped.

18:01.707 --> 18:04.640
So don't tell me
i'm not his real mother!

18:04.707 --> 18:06.907
I didn't mean
to offend you.

18:06.974 --> 18:09.573
I'm just trying
to find his
biological mother.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.940
Jason wants to know
where she is.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.740
You're telling me...

18:13.807 --> 18:15.707
that from beyond the grave,

18:15.774 --> 18:19.807
my son wants to find out
who gave him up?

18:19.874 --> 18:22.807
Pretty much, yeah.

18:22.874 --> 18:24.874
He needs closure.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.940
My son is dead...

18:30.007 --> 18:32.408
and that's hard enough
to live with.

18:32.474 --> 18:34.241
Leave me alone.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.707
You know i missed you,
squeaky.

18:38.774 --> 18:41.341
And the girls are always
asking about their
aunt andrea.

18:41.408 --> 18:43.441
Next time,
you have to bring them.

18:43.508 --> 18:46.907
Yeah, yeah. I mean,
everybody's schedules
are so crazy, but...

18:46.974 --> 18:50.074
so, what are you gonna
do with this place?
You gonna flip it?

18:50.141 --> 18:53.408
Well, i could.
I got a waiting list of clients

18:53.474 --> 18:55.573
looking for homes
just like this.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.940
Do you like it?

18:58.007 --> 19:01.041
Are you kidding?
I'd love to live
in a place like this.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.807
Good. 'cause i just
made an offer on it
this morning.

19:03.874 --> 19:05.141
You're moving
to grandview.

19:05.207 --> 19:06.974
I wanna open up
a second office.

19:07.041 --> 19:08.573
Part-time, of course.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.207
So i'll live in one
of the bedrooms,

19:10.274 --> 19:13.107
and that leaves the rest
of the house for you.

19:13.174 --> 19:15.207
Oh, but i have
a place.

19:15.274 --> 19:17.740
With all due respect,
squeaky, what you have
is a shoe box.

19:17.807 --> 19:19.141
I like my place.

19:19.207 --> 19:20.840
You just said
you'd love to live here.

19:20.907 --> 19:22.774
It'll be fun,
just like when
we were kids,

19:22.840 --> 19:25.074
spending summers
at the beach house.

20:33.907 --> 20:35.774
Jason?

20:35.840 --> 20:37.341
Are you...

20:43.174 --> 20:45.207
are you here?

21:02.374 --> 21:05.707
I know it must have
taken a lot for you
to come and see me.

21:05.774 --> 21:09.107
He was there with me
in the house.
I can't deny it.

21:09.174 --> 21:12.007
And it was not
just the music, either.

21:12.074 --> 21:14.607
I felt him.

21:14.673 --> 21:17.274
He feels a lot of
anger and confusion.

21:17.341 --> 21:19.774
The last thing
i ever wanted to do
was hurt him.

21:19.840 --> 21:23.174
Why didn't
you just tell jason
he was adopted?

21:23.241 --> 21:24.607
Well...

21:24.673 --> 21:26.274
we meant to...

21:26.341 --> 21:28.408
every mother
and father's day,

21:28.474 --> 21:30.107
every birthday, but...

21:30.174 --> 21:33.408
the moment just...
didn't seem right.

21:33.474 --> 21:36.174
We were afraid
of how he would react.

21:36.241 --> 21:38.441
He was bound
to find out.

21:38.508 --> 21:41.107
When i brought him
home from the hospital,

21:41.174 --> 21:43.341
i held on to him
for 2 days.

21:43.408 --> 21:47.907
I was terrified
the woman who gave birth
to him would... want him back.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.874
You know who she is,
don't you?

21:55.041 --> 21:56.607
When jason
first found out,

21:56.673 --> 21:58.673
i wanted to know
who she was.

21:58.740 --> 22:01.041
I tracked her down.

22:01.107 --> 22:03.041
Her name is fran vaughn.

22:03.107 --> 22:06.607
[Paper rustles]
This is her address.

22:08.707 --> 22:10.640
If it means that much
to jason,

22:10.707 --> 22:12.607
i'm not going to
stand in his way.

22:12.673 --> 22:15.041
I'm not going to try
to protect him anymore.

22:16.607 --> 22:18.774
Protect him from what?

22:21.041 --> 22:23.441
From his birth mother.

22:23.508 --> 22:26.774
She's not the little angel
he thinks she is.

22:35.958 --> 22:38.557
I like what you've
done with the yard.

22:38.624 --> 22:40.524
Thought i'd touch up
a few little things

22:40.591 --> 22:43.457
so, you know, mitch
could start showing
the place.

22:43.524 --> 22:46.057
I'm glad that andrea
invited mitch over.

22:46.123 --> 22:48.524
If he sells this house
for as much as he says,

22:48.591 --> 22:50.691
we'll have quite
the little nest egg
for our future.

22:50.757 --> 22:52.457
Yeah, it's a smart move.
It's just...

22:52.524 --> 22:53.924
a lotta work's
gone into this house.

22:53.990 --> 22:55.958
That's the problem.
You've been too busy
working

22:56.023 --> 22:57.924
when you could have
been playing with me.

22:57.990 --> 23:01.757
Oh, uh, you know,
i think i got a little
time right now.

23:01.824 --> 23:04.457
Later, tiger.
I have to catch a train.

23:04.524 --> 23:06.657
I'm going to go talk
to jason's birth mother.

23:06.724 --> 23:09.257
Wait a minute. Whoa.
She's gonna be shocked.

23:09.324 --> 23:11.257
Shouldn't you call her
first?

23:11.324 --> 23:14.257
I have to tell a woman
the baby she gave away
18 years ago

23:14.324 --> 23:16.824
wants to meet her.
Then i have to tell her
that he's dead.

23:16.891 --> 23:19.290
Not the kind of
conversation i want to
have over the phone.

23:19.357 --> 23:20.990
Or in person?

23:21.057 --> 23:23.757
Yeah, well...
welcome to my world.

23:26.824 --> 23:28.924
That woman looks like
she could be my mother.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.824
Her, too.

23:33.090 --> 23:34.591
Hey! I'm walking here!

23:34.657 --> 23:36.791
Oh, do you believe
these people?

23:36.858 --> 23:39.757
What are you doing?
Someone might think
you're talking to yourself.

23:39.824 --> 23:42.691
Yeah, and wouldn't care.
Half the people in the city
talk to themselves.

23:45.357 --> 23:47.324
What do you think
she's like?

23:47.390 --> 23:50.958
You're gonna know
in about 10 seconds.
That's her address.

23:51.023 --> 23:52.990
What's the matter?

23:53.057 --> 23:54.958
What if she doesn't
remember me?

23:55.023 --> 23:57.290
Well, i've never given
birth, but from
what i hear,

23:57.357 --> 23:59.123
it's not something
you forget.

23:59.190 --> 24:01.457
What if she doesn't
want to remember me?

24:01.524 --> 24:03.958
Hey, it doesn't matter
what she wants.

24:04.023 --> 24:06.224
You need to meet her.
Come on.

24:06.290 --> 24:08.057
No, i can't.

24:08.123 --> 24:12.390
Look, you go on
without me.
I'm not ready.

24:20.090 --> 24:21.290
Yeah?

24:21.357 --> 24:22.858
Is fran vaughn in?

24:24.424 --> 24:25.958
I'm here on behalf
of your son.

24:26.023 --> 24:28.390
I don't have a son,
just a daughter.

24:28.457 --> 24:30.924
Well, someone took
this photo of you
and your new baby

24:30.990 --> 24:32.157
18 years ago.

24:35.257 --> 24:37.224
How do you know
that's me?

24:37.290 --> 24:39.557
Tattoo, amongst
other reasons.

24:42.958 --> 24:44.424
Look, i can't be
doing this.

24:44.491 --> 24:45.757
Your son's name
is jason shields,

24:45.824 --> 24:47.390
and he'd like to make
contact with you.

24:47.457 --> 24:50.491
I was a different person
back then.

24:50.557 --> 24:53.557
I got sent to juvie upstate
because i was young
and stupid.

24:53.624 --> 24:56.390
I had no idea
what i was doing
half the time.

24:56.457 --> 24:57.791
Well, you knew
good enough

24:57.858 --> 25:00.290
to try to make a better
life for your son.

25:00.357 --> 25:04.524
My husband's inside,
and my daughter's
going to be home any minute.

25:04.591 --> 25:08.057
They had no idea
i had a kid,
and i don't want them to.

25:08.123 --> 25:11.390
They don't have to know.
But jason wants to make
contact with you.

25:11.457 --> 25:14.057
No. I can't. I'm sorry.

25:14.123 --> 25:16.591
Your son is dead.

25:16.657 --> 25:19.224
What?

25:19.290 --> 25:20.724
He died a year ago.

25:20.791 --> 25:22.390
Jason was allergic
to bees.

25:22.457 --> 25:24.057
He got stung,
and he died.

25:24.123 --> 25:27.724
But... you said
he's trying to make
contact with me?

25:27.791 --> 25:29.424
He is.

25:29.491 --> 25:31.457
What the hell is this?
Who are you?

25:31.524 --> 25:34.457
My name's melinda gordon.
I'm from grandview,

25:34.524 --> 25:38.524
and have this... gift
to speak with and see...

25:38.591 --> 25:39.924
dead people?

25:39.990 --> 25:43.524
Yes. People who have
died and not yet
crossed over.

25:43.591 --> 25:46.123
Ha ha ha! Wow.

25:46.190 --> 25:49.224
Hoo! Wow. You really
had me going there
for a minute.

25:49.290 --> 25:51.090
Um... we're not buying
at this house.

25:51.157 --> 25:54.457
Please at least
take my card. You can
reach me at my store.

25:54.524 --> 25:56.190
Sure, sure, look, uh,

25:56.257 --> 25:57.524
you're a nut job, lady.

25:57.591 --> 26:00.691
Get off my stoop,
and don't bother me again.

26:02.090 --> 26:03.290
Right.

26:20.657 --> 26:22.891
I thought you liked
living in your apartment.

26:22.958 --> 26:24.390
I do. I love
my apartment.

26:24.457 --> 26:25.891
So much
that you're moving?

26:25.958 --> 26:27.891
Into a house. Hello!
I'm the only person
i know

26:27.958 --> 26:29.891
who has a smaller
place here than they
did in the city.

26:29.958 --> 26:32.324
Ooh, there you are.

26:32.390 --> 26:34.257
There who is?
Be right back.

26:34.324 --> 26:35.990
Okey-dokey.

26:36.057 --> 26:37.090
What's she like?

26:37.157 --> 26:38.591
I'm sure
she's a nice person.

26:38.657 --> 26:40.357
She blow you off?
Pretty much, yeah.

26:40.424 --> 26:42.457
So, melinda.

26:42.524 --> 26:46.190
Either i'm running a fever
or i'm starting to see
ghosts myself.

26:48.624 --> 26:51.591
Hey, i'm sybil.
Fran vaughn's daughter.

26:51.657 --> 26:54.090
We need to talk.

26:54.157 --> 26:56.090
[Laughing] my mother
would have a kitten

26:56.157 --> 26:57.591
if she knew
i was here right now.

26:57.657 --> 26:59.090
You weren't supposed to
hear our conversation.

26:59.157 --> 27:01.691
I'm glad i did.
I have a half-brother,

27:01.757 --> 27:03.357
and he's dead.

27:03.424 --> 27:07.791
I think it's so cool
that you can talk to ghosts.

27:07.858 --> 27:09.023
How rad is that?

27:09.090 --> 27:10.491
I love this kid.

27:10.557 --> 27:12.824
What does my brother
look like?

27:12.891 --> 27:16.390
He's handsome.
You guys have
the same eyes.

27:16.457 --> 27:18.390
Wait a minute.
He's... he's here?

27:19.891 --> 27:22.057
Oh ho ho! My god!

27:23.924 --> 27:26.891
what's it like
to be dead?

27:26.958 --> 27:29.224
It's kinda like
freshman year
all over again.

27:29.290 --> 27:33.457
You're there, but...
nobody pays any
attention to you.

27:33.524 --> 27:36.090
He says it's kinda like
freshman year.

27:36.157 --> 27:39.958
Oh, the banality
of being invisible.

27:40.057 --> 27:42.123
Oh, that sucks.

27:43.290 --> 27:46.457
What do you miss most
about being alive?

27:48.557 --> 27:50.757
Lots of things.

27:50.824 --> 27:53.424
He misses you
and your mother.

27:53.491 --> 27:55.757
He wants to know
what she's like.

27:55.824 --> 27:59.624
Oh, um... she's a pain
in my butt.

28:01.724 --> 28:03.757
Everything...

28:03.824 --> 28:05.557
has to be done her way
or no way.

28:05.624 --> 28:09.190
She always wants to know
what i'm doing,
who i'm with.

28:09.257 --> 28:11.691
But when you need
to talk to her,

28:11.757 --> 28:13.791
she doesn't have time.

28:15.791 --> 28:18.424
I can't stand her.
I just...

28:18.491 --> 28:22.023
sometimes i won't even
go inside when i get
home from school.

28:22.090 --> 28:24.524
I'll just hide out
under the stoop
and put on my headphones

28:24.591 --> 28:26.757
and listen to some morrissey
so i don't have to deal.

28:26.824 --> 28:30.390
Tell her i'd give her
anything to be in her
shoes.

28:30.457 --> 28:33.724
He wishes he could
trade places
with you.

28:33.791 --> 28:36.224
Oh, um, yeah,
i wish he could, too,
right now.

28:36.290 --> 28:37.990
I'd rather be dead.

28:38.057 --> 28:39.624
Hey, sybil,

28:39.691 --> 28:41.757
it's not good to say
stuff like that.

28:41.824 --> 28:43.824
It's true.

28:43.891 --> 28:45.924
You don't know
what it's like.

28:45.990 --> 28:48.591
I don't have...
anyone to talk to.

28:48.657 --> 28:51.591
You have me.
Tell her she can
talk to me.

28:51.657 --> 28:53.224
He wants you
to talk to him.

28:53.290 --> 28:56.057
Really <i>talk</i> talk?

28:56.123 --> 28:58.757
Go ahead.

29:02.324 --> 29:05.424
I'm in trouble,
and i don't...

29:05.491 --> 29:07.524
really know what to do.

29:21.290 --> 29:23.058
Jim, you asleep?

29:24.390 --> 29:27.357
That depends if
you're coming to bed.

29:27.424 --> 29:30.190
I can't stay.
We have company
downstairs.

29:30.257 --> 29:31.424
Living or dead?

29:31.490 --> 29:33.223
One of each.

29:33.290 --> 29:35.190
Oh, hey,
mitch called.

29:35.257 --> 29:37.190
He might have a buyer
for the house,

29:37.257 --> 29:39.891
and he wants to know
if he can show it
next weekend.

29:39.957 --> 29:41.223
You ok with that?

29:41.290 --> 29:42.490
So soon?

29:42.557 --> 29:44.390
Well, yeah. I told him
you wanted to move out.

29:44.457 --> 29:47.557
Me? You're the one
that said we should
try and flip it.

29:47.624 --> 29:49.557
Only because you said
you were interested,
you know?

29:49.624 --> 29:51.557
Now that i know
you're not happy...

29:51.624 --> 29:53.058
not happy?

29:53.124 --> 29:55.058
Yeah, you're always
tired of me trying
to fix things up.

29:55.124 --> 29:57.991
Well, yeah, i am,
but that doesn't mean
i wanna move.

29:58.058 --> 30:00.857
I love that the doors
are crooked and the
bannister's broken

30:00.924 --> 30:03.124
and the windows
won't stay up.

30:03.190 --> 30:05.590
I know that we can
make a lot of money
if we flip it...

30:05.657 --> 30:08.924
just because we could
doesn't mean we should.

30:08.991 --> 30:10.657
Ok. I don't care
about the money.

30:10.724 --> 30:12.190
This is our home.

30:12.257 --> 30:15.891
I agree. But then
why are we trying
to sell it?

30:15.957 --> 30:17.891
Because we're so
stupid in love

30:17.957 --> 30:20.024
that we'd do anything
to make each other happy.

30:20.091 --> 30:23.824
This is like
an o. Henry story
told by donald trump.

30:23.891 --> 30:26.857
Does that mean that you...

30:26.924 --> 30:29.557
will tell mitch
that we don't want
to sell?

30:29.624 --> 30:32.223
No. It means i'll get
andrea to tell him for you.

30:32.290 --> 30:34.091
Oh... l...

30:34.158 --> 30:35.824
sleep.

30:35.891 --> 30:38.957
I don't know
if you can hear me.

30:39.024 --> 30:42.058
But i just... i don't
know what i'm doing.

30:42.124 --> 30:46.457
I don't want to mess
this up any more than
i already have.

30:46.524 --> 30:47.824
She's so young.

30:47.891 --> 30:49.791
One year older
than your mother
when she had you.

30:49.857 --> 30:52.223
Jason, i'm so scared.

30:59.390 --> 31:00.824
where's my daughter?

31:00.891 --> 31:02.223
Living room.

31:04.024 --> 31:06.524
Come on, syb.
Get your things.
We're going.

31:06.590 --> 31:08.424
Melinda: You know,
it's late.

31:08.490 --> 31:10.158
Why don't you sit
for a minute?

31:10.223 --> 31:12.158
I'll make you
some coffee
for the drive back.

31:12.223 --> 31:14.824
Thanks for letting me know
that she's here,
but we need to go.

31:20.357 --> 31:22.290
If you've got
something to say,
say it now.

31:22.357 --> 31:24.091
Mom.

31:24.158 --> 31:25.158
I'm pregnant.

31:27.390 --> 31:28.824
Say something.

31:30.691 --> 31:32.691
Mom, talk to me.

31:32.757 --> 31:34.457
Get in the car.

31:34.524 --> 31:37.024
No. Not until
you talk to me.

31:37.091 --> 31:40.390
I have been trying
to talk to you about this
for the last 2 months.

31:40.457 --> 31:43.857
You've been pregnant
for 2 months and you
didn't tell me?

31:43.924 --> 31:45.824
You didn't tell me about
your pregnancy either.

31:45.891 --> 31:48.557
It was a mistake,
sybil. A terrible
mistake.

31:48.624 --> 31:54.257
Mom, jason can hear you,
ok? You're hurting
his feelings.

31:54.323 --> 31:56.390
Stop it!
There's no jason.

31:56.457 --> 31:58.490
Listen to me, sybil.

31:58.557 --> 32:01.557
Giving up that baby
was the best thing
i could have done.

32:01.624 --> 32:06.124
When i got pregnant,
i knew i had to walk
away from that baby.

32:08.091 --> 32:10.058
But it forced me
to grow up.

32:10.124 --> 32:13.257
I finished high school.
I met your father.

32:13.323 --> 32:15.158
I had you.

32:15.223 --> 32:17.158
And that's what
you'll do, too.

32:17.223 --> 32:20.058
You'll put this baby
up for adoption,

32:20.124 --> 32:22.158
and everything will be
fine again, ok?

32:22.223 --> 32:23.390
Now, come on.
Let's go home.

32:23.457 --> 32:24.557
No!

32:30.757 --> 32:33.857
Um, it's getting late.
Maybe she should
just stay here.

32:33.924 --> 32:36.124
You, too, if you want.

32:36.190 --> 32:39.424
What's the point?
She'll still be
pregnant in the morning.

32:39.490 --> 32:42.357
I have to deal with
this now.

32:42.424 --> 32:45.590
And frankly,
none of this is any
of your business.

32:45.657 --> 32:48.957
But i know someone.

32:49.024 --> 32:52.657
Someone she should meet,
someone who knows a lot
about adoption.

32:56.824 --> 32:58.190
Fine.

32:58.257 --> 33:00.290
One night.

33:05.058 --> 33:07.058
Diane:
Come on in.

33:09.091 --> 33:10.657
I'll be right out.

33:13.390 --> 33:15.824
I don't understand
why we're here.

33:15.891 --> 33:18.124
If you still want to
leave in 10 minutes,

33:18.190 --> 33:20.124
i'll take you back
to your car.

33:53.824 --> 33:55.724
Come on, sybil.

33:57.024 --> 33:58.724
Diane: Hello.

33:59.757 --> 34:02.290
My name is diane.

34:02.357 --> 34:04.323
I raised your son.

34:04.390 --> 34:07.357
I owe you an apology.

34:07.424 --> 34:09.956
I never told him
he was adopted.

34:10.024 --> 34:13.322
But he found out,
and he wanted
to meet you.

34:13.389 --> 34:15.623
I wouldn't let him.

34:15.690 --> 34:18.657
That's what
we argued about
the day he died.

34:20.389 --> 34:21.924
His name was jason.

34:26.389 --> 34:28.991
He was a wonderful
kid, fran.

34:29.058 --> 34:31.724
He was smart
and funny,

34:31.791 --> 34:33.824
and he cared
about people.

34:33.891 --> 34:37.223
It's the one thing
you can't teach,
isn't it?

34:41.257 --> 34:44.524
And he was kind...

34:44.590 --> 34:47.524
and he was gentle,
and you would have
been proud of him.

34:47.590 --> 34:50.091
Please stop now.

34:53.657 --> 34:55.757
Mom, please talk to me.

34:55.824 --> 35:00.290
Fran, jason's here.
He wants to talk to you.

35:02.957 --> 35:06.357
I didn't believe it
either, fran...

35:06.424 --> 35:08.657
but it's true.

35:08.724 --> 35:11.457
Jason's here.

35:11.524 --> 35:14.957
And melinda can talk
to him for us.

35:17.791 --> 35:19.791
Ok. That's it.

35:19.857 --> 35:21.957
Come on, syb.

35:24.657 --> 35:26.657
Sybil, right now!

35:57.991 --> 36:01.224
he looks just like
his father.

36:12.890 --> 36:16.291
Why is it that families
keep so many secrets
from each other?

36:16.358 --> 36:18.458
Well, because family's
so important.

36:18.523 --> 36:20.458
It's the hardest love
to lose, you know?

36:20.523 --> 36:22.124
And that's why
it's so difficult

36:22.191 --> 36:23.957
to tell your family
how you really feel.

36:24.024 --> 36:27.291
And your friends.
Jim and i decided we don't
want to flip our house,

36:27.358 --> 36:29.224
and we need you
to tell him.

36:29.291 --> 36:30.623
Absolutely.

36:30.690 --> 36:32.458
Right after i work up
the courage

36:32.523 --> 36:34.458
to tell him i'm staying
in my shoe box
of an apartment.

36:34.523 --> 36:36.590
Whoa! Why the change
of heart?

36:36.657 --> 36:39.924
I've changed.
I'm not squeaky
anymore.

36:39.991 --> 36:41.757
You know, i wasn't
lovin' squeaky.

36:41.824 --> 36:44.690
I have a really hard
time being myself
around my brother.

36:44.757 --> 36:46.690
You'll always be
his little sister.

36:46.757 --> 36:48.790
You're just not
a little girl anymore.

36:48.857 --> 36:51.191
Speaking of not being
a little girl
anymore...

36:58.324 --> 37:00.391
so how do i do this?

37:00.458 --> 37:02.557
Do i look at you?

37:02.623 --> 37:05.824
You can. Or you can
just look at the picture.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.690
Just say what's
in your heart.

37:07.757 --> 37:10.291
She looks so sad.

37:10.358 --> 37:12.623
Yeah. This is hard
for her.

37:12.690 --> 37:15.091
He's here?

37:18.957 --> 37:21.857
Jason...

37:21.924 --> 37:24.857
when i was
at your house

37:24.924 --> 37:26.957
and i saw those
pictures

37:27.024 --> 37:29.957
and i heard the way
diane talked
about you,

37:30.024 --> 37:31.291
i was...

37:31.358 --> 37:35.557
i am so proud.

37:35.623 --> 37:39.157
I know i don't have
a right to feel that way,

37:39.224 --> 37:42.057
but... i am.

37:42.124 --> 37:45.890
And i'm so sorry for me

37:45.957 --> 37:47.991
that i didn't get
to know you.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.490
You may not believe
this,

37:49.557 --> 37:51.557
but there's always been
this empty place in me,

37:51.623 --> 37:54.724
and now that i've seen
how you grew up

37:54.790 --> 37:56.424
and where...

37:56.490 --> 37:59.523
and how much
you're loved,

37:59.590 --> 38:02.690
it feels
a little less empty.

38:02.757 --> 38:05.091
What's gonna happen
to sybil's baby?

38:05.157 --> 38:07.790
He wants to know
what's gonna happen
with the baby.

38:09.657 --> 38:12.590
I don't know.
We have a lot...

38:12.657 --> 38:14.091
to work out.

38:14.157 --> 38:19.458
But whatever sybil...
whatever your sister
decides,

38:19.523 --> 38:21.623
we will be a part
of this baby's life.

38:23.523 --> 38:26.957
And the baby's
gonna know about
uncle jason.

38:27.024 --> 38:29.523
And diane.

38:29.590 --> 38:32.024
Can he hear us?

38:32.091 --> 38:35.124
Yeah, he can.

38:35.191 --> 38:37.257
He's smiling.

38:39.523 --> 38:42.523
He has a lot of questions
for you.

38:42.590 --> 38:44.124
I thought i did,

38:44.191 --> 38:47.991
but there's only
one thing i really
need to know.

38:51.623 --> 38:54.224
Did you ever think
about me?

38:54.291 --> 38:57.191
Did you ever say a prayer
for me at thanksgiving

38:57.257 --> 39:00.391
or wonder what kind
of presents i was
getting at christmas?

39:00.458 --> 39:02.991
Did you even remember
my birthday?

39:04.824 --> 39:06.991
Do you love me, mom?

39:08.857 --> 39:10.757
Uh, he wants to know...

39:10.824 --> 39:12.257
no, wait. Um...

39:12.324 --> 39:14.157
don't ask.

39:16.057 --> 39:19.391
I don't want to know
if the answer's no.

39:19.458 --> 39:20.857
What is it?

39:23.024 --> 39:25.523
Uh, this is hard
for me. Um...

39:25.590 --> 39:28.590
he wants to ask you
something, but he
doesn't know how.

39:28.657 --> 39:31.790
Tell him... he can
ask me anything.

39:31.857 --> 39:34.523
He's my son.
I love him.

39:45.057 --> 39:48.358
He would love to hear you
say that again.

39:48.424 --> 39:50.857
He's my son.

39:50.924 --> 39:53.057
I love him.

40:00.224 --> 40:02.157
Give them the picture?

40:02.224 --> 40:03.890
Oh, right.

40:10.690 --> 40:12.623
That's your brother.

40:18.924 --> 40:20.991
It's ok, baby.

40:31.857 --> 40:34.890
I still have one more
person to see.

40:39.391 --> 40:40.991
He wants you to know

40:41.057 --> 40:44.024
that he was
so hurt and angry
over being adopted

40:44.091 --> 40:48.590
that he took it out
on the one person
who was always there for him.

40:48.657 --> 40:52.523
All you ever tried to do
was protect me
and love me.

40:52.590 --> 40:54.790
No matter how hard
i tried to push you
away,

40:54.857 --> 40:57.458
you never
gave up on me.

40:57.523 --> 41:00.057
He feels lucky
to have been your son.

41:00.124 --> 41:02.757
I was the lucky one.

41:02.824 --> 41:06.057
For 17 years,

41:06.124 --> 41:08.224
you made my life shine.

41:08.291 --> 41:11.257
You were
the greatest gift.

41:11.324 --> 41:13.257
He's sorry
that he got mad

41:13.324 --> 41:15.358
and that it ended
that way.

41:15.424 --> 41:18.224
But it's not ended.

41:18.291 --> 41:19.890
And it never will be.

41:19.957 --> 41:22.024
I will always
be with you.

41:22.091 --> 41:25.890
And you will always
be with me.

41:29.623 --> 41:31.623
What's that light?

41:31.690 --> 41:35.490
That light's for you.
If you're ready.

41:36.890 --> 41:38.224
I'm ready.

41:40.257 --> 41:41.458
Bye, mom.

41:51.391 --> 41:53.458
He's crossed over.

41:55.024 --> 41:56.657
Good boy.

42:01.191 --> 42:03.257
Shoot.

42:03.324 --> 42:05.458
I've got something
in my eye again.

42:08.690 --> 42:10.358
I'll walk with you.
