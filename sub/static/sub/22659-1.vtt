00:17.620 --> 00:19.610
Hello, Carla.
How are you this morning?

00:20.280 --> 00:22.070
- Where's the dropoff?
- You're in a good mood.

00:22.780 --> 00:24.480
Things haven't started
going wrong yet.

00:24.940 --> 00:26.290
Nothing's going to go wrong.

00:26.620 --> 00:28.770
You shouldn't have said that.
Now I'm not in a good mood. Thanks.

00:29.370 --> 00:30.920
I'm here to help.

00:34.720 --> 00:36.630
Sending coordinates now.

00:38.470 --> 00:40.230
It looks like a parking garage.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.160
How do you handle all
this glamour, Frank?

00:43.780 --> 00:46.230
It's about the journey,
not the destination.

00:47.060 --> 00:48.730
Are you quoting
Carla Bruni again?

00:49.530 --> 00:51.070
Why?
Are you jealous?

03:23.230 --> 03:24.270
Can I help you?

03:24.760 --> 03:27.500
You know, you are killing the ozone layer,
leaving your engine running like this.

03:27.670 --> 03:30.900
I don't suppose you've ever considered
switching to a natural gas powered car.

03:31.330 --> 03:32.310
Like mine.

03:37.420 --> 03:39.300
Wonderful, another gas guzzler!

03:48.790 --> 03:50.180
Why are they shooting?

03:55.040 --> 03:55.870
What the fuck?

03:56.790 --> 03:57.870
What's going on?

04:03.850 --> 04:04.390
Thanks!

04:06.130 --> 04:07.240
Oh my god!

04:19.899 --> 04:20.579
Let me out!

04:28.700 --> 04:31.980
What the hell is going on?
Who were those guys?

04:32.190 --> 04:32.930
Seat belt.

04:33.850 --> 04:34.560
Shit!

05:14.020 --> 05:15.000
What are you doing ?

05:21.400 --> 05:23.400
Look what you've done
to my car!

05:50.350 --> 05:53.499
Sorry about your car.
Maybe next time try electric.

06:08.180 --> 06:08.990
What ?

06:09.910 --> 06:11.360
Looks like the drop site
has been compromised.

06:11.962 --> 06:12.599
No delivery then?

06:12.190 --> 06:13.640
They still want the package, Frank.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.480
I should throw it in the river.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.650
I'm sending you new coordinates.

06:44.720 --> 06:45.420
Where is it?

06:46.790 --> 06:47.800
Trunk.

06:51.570 --> 06:53.980
Sorry for the last minute change.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.510
But, uh...
these things happen.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.520
I guess this concludes our business.

07:09.850 --> 07:10.930
Except for one thing.

07:14.690 --> 07:17.200
Rule number 1:
never change the deal.

08:52.190 --> 08:53.570
Hello, Inspector Tarconi.

08:53.970 --> 08:55.850
Frank, you're home!

08:56.140 --> 08:57.380
Is there something i can help you with?

08:57.900 --> 08:58.570
Uhh.. I'm sure it's nothing really.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.200
There was an incident
in the parking garage.

09:02.590 --> 09:03.430
Sounds fascinating!

09:03.690 --> 09:05.700
Why don't you come inside,
we can discuss it.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.200
Now?

09:11.030 --> 09:12.040
About this incident.

09:16.310 --> 09:18.670
An unfortunate thing,
drug guns.

09:18.940 --> 09:21.580
Someone trying to steal
the merchandise

09:21.840 --> 09:23.920
and someone trying
to stop them.

09:24.590 --> 09:26.850
I don't suppose you know anything about it?

09:30.250 --> 09:31.760
There was a witness.

09:33.590 --> 09:35.130
Then you should talk to him.

09:35.410 --> 09:36.830
It was a: "her".

09:38.120 --> 09:39.820
Or perhaps you knew
it was a "her"

09:40.060 --> 09:41.960
and you were trying
to bluff me.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.790
I'm not sure how reliable
her story is.

09:49.220 --> 09:51.710
I have the feeling
she was leaving something out.

09:53.340 --> 09:55.290
Young people, today...

09:57.310 --> 09:59.140
Another business trip?

10:03.340 --> 10:04.040
Hey, sweetheart!

10:05.690 --> 10:06.270
My girlfriend.

10:06.530 --> 10:07.540
Don't try to sweet talk me,
Frank.

10:07.780 --> 10:09.480
The client wants to present
assault charges.

10:09.720 --> 10:10.820
Well, that's very nice of them.

10:11.250 --> 10:12.700
Tell him I'll have lunch
with him anytime.

10:13.250 --> 10:15.040
Can you make it to Berlin
in 7 hours?

10:15.280 --> 10:16.520
Seems a bit hasty...

10:16.750 --> 10:18.540
but if your mother insists,
I don't see why not.

10:18.810 --> 10:21.140
Okay, I'm getting
details when we confirm.

10:21.840 --> 10:23.490
Did she say whether
it was black tie?

10:23.940 --> 10:24.790
Frank,

10:25.060 --> 10:27.410
you can wear a clown suit
as far as I'm concerned.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.320
Bye, darling.

10:31.440 --> 10:32.480
Inspector,

10:33.370 --> 10:35.230
any idea where I can
rent a tuxedo?

10:43.150 --> 10:44.070
Good afternoon.

10:44.590 --> 10:46.330
I just got coordinates
for the pickup.

10:46.560 --> 10:47.850
Hotel Gendarmenmarkt.

10:48.120 --> 10:49.610
I'm also sending you a photo.

10:53.030 --> 10:54.980
- This the contact?
- That's the package.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.790
The client wants to make sure
she gets out of Berlin safely.

10:58.190 --> 10:59.860
And I'm told the photo's
not so recent,

11:00.090 --> 11:01.830
so she might look
a little different.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.140
You must be the chauffeur.

11:49.280 --> 11:50.230
Hey, what's happening?

11:52.620 --> 11:53.820
Yeah, I'm not in a rush.

12:05.250 --> 12:08.760
No, I can't. I gotta go meet my dad,
he sent me a driver.

12:09.620 --> 12:10.860
I don't know.

12:11.370 --> 12:13.660
No, he's been acting
pretty weird lately, actually.

12:20.530 --> 12:21.410
Excuse me, miss!

12:22.710 --> 12:23.820
I'm on a schedule here.

12:25.180 --> 12:26.790
Look, I'm going to have
to get back to you. Okay?

12:27.280 --> 12:28.270
Bye.

12:33.000 --> 12:33.790
So? Let's go!

12:42.590 --> 12:44.380
My bags are at the front.

12:46.090 --> 12:47.670
I'll just be a minute.

13:01.710 --> 13:02.660
Okay. Come on.

13:27.460 --> 13:28.660
Room service.

13:48.370 --> 13:49.500
Can I help you ?

13:50.150 --> 13:51.070
Where is she?

13:51.310 --> 13:53.140
I think that's the girl
from the change room.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.880
What do you think?
Too much?

13:59.430 --> 14:00.110
It's very pretty.

14:00.810 --> 14:02.500
I'll try on something else.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.700
Don't go,
I'm gonna need a man's opinion.

14:09.810 --> 14:10.500
Very nice.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.310
Get this on.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.610
I'm just going to be a minute.

16:01.120 --> 16:01.810
Come on!

16:02.400 --> 16:03.320
What ?

16:04.990 --> 16:06.870
Who is going to clean this up?

16:20.050 --> 16:22.040
What the hell is going on?
Who were those guys?

16:22.270 --> 16:23.970
You must have really done
something to piss them off.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.690
This is not about me.
They were after you.

16:26.930 --> 16:27.760
What?

16:28.080 --> 16:30.870
I was hired to get you out of Berlin
and drive you to a safe house.

16:31.270 --> 16:32.470
That's what I'm going to do.

16:56.080 --> 16:59.250
Herr Trumpf, she had a man with her.
Some kind of bodyguard.

16:59.740 --> 17:02.880
The police were out front before these
three could get out of the hotel.

17:03.740 --> 17:06.250
What do you think we Germans
are known for in these days?

17:07.420 --> 17:09.089
I mean, besides the obvious:

17:09.359 --> 17:12.790
Hitler and wearing socks
with our sandals.

17:17.710 --> 17:18.880
Reliability.

17:19.609 --> 17:21.760
Give us a task,
we show up on time

17:22.240 --> 17:23.910
and finish on budget.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.430
The world may not love us,

17:27.859 --> 17:31.160
but they do need us,
as long as we deliver.

17:32.860 --> 17:34.190
Because, if we don't...

17:34.960 --> 17:36.810
We lose our right to exist,
you know.

17:38.420 --> 17:40.820
And our culture dies with us.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.070
I need a doctor.

17:46.740 --> 17:48.750
Not anymore.
Do you need a doctor?

17:54.360 --> 17:56.060
I'm not very happy about this.

17:56.330 --> 17:58.710
It may be time to get
a little more aggressive.

18:14.240 --> 18:15.910
How long have I been asleep?

18:16.560 --> 18:17.750
A couple of hundred
kilometers.

18:23.830 --> 18:24.750
What's your name ?

18:26.270 --> 18:27.760
Rule number 2: No names.

18:28.800 --> 18:29.900
Rule number 2?

18:30.240 --> 18:31.670
How many rules are there?

18:34.390 --> 18:35.880
What does your father do for a living?

18:36.980 --> 18:39.810
He was a general in the U.S. Army.

18:42.420 --> 18:43.030
What is it?

18:44.200 --> 18:47.680
Retired generals don't usually have the
kind of money that attracts kidnappers

18:48.080 --> 18:50.490
Yeah well,
now he's a consultant.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.150
He's involved with a lot of big deals
with government contractors,

18:53.700 --> 18:54.900
military agencies...

18:55.730 --> 18:58.490
Last week he was at a conference
with the president of France.

19:31.230 --> 19:32.180
Dad!

19:33.300 --> 19:33.990
Delia!

19:37.030 --> 19:39.210
It's good to see you again. Come on
inside. Let's get you cleaned up.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.090
Come in.

19:44.420 --> 19:45.950
What is going on?

19:46.510 --> 19:49.000
- Your father didn't talk to you?
- Yeah, right!

19:49.530 --> 19:52.520
He said he wanted to spend time with me and he'd
send a driver and now I'm running for my life.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.020
I'm sorry, who is that guy?

19:54.870 --> 19:56.030
He's a transporter.

19:57.650 --> 20:00.990
Look, I'm your father's personal assistant,
but that doesn't mean he tells me everything.

20:01.550 --> 20:02.340
Whatever.

20:02.610 --> 20:06.060
He's been distracted lately.
I thought he might be worried about you.

20:06.420 --> 20:07.490
I doubt it!

20:07.980 --> 20:11.180
All I am to him is a yearly birthday
call and a monthly check.

20:11.940 --> 20:12.940
That's not true.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.150
I know it is.

20:15.730 --> 20:17.800
You've taken better care of me
the last couple years than he has.

20:18.790 --> 20:19.630
Look,

20:19.980 --> 20:23.180
if you want to know what this is all about,
you're really going to have to ask him.

20:26.090 --> 20:29.430
Right now, I can't trust anyone
in my own organization.

20:30.110 --> 20:31.740
That much I already know.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.530
3 guys tried to take Delia before
I could get her out of the hotel.

20:35.170 --> 20:37.660
They knew exactly where to find her.
You've got a leak.

20:39.110 --> 20:40.290
That's what I was afraid of.

20:41.650 --> 20:44.160
- Whatever you're into, what's it got to
do with your daughter? - Nothing.

20:44.430 --> 20:47.180
She's just a way for some of my
business partners to apply pressure

20:47.420 --> 20:49.210
to keep me from rocking the boat.

20:49.980 --> 20:53.990
I just found out that my partners are
into a lot more than moving currency.

20:54.360 --> 20:57.300
It was drugs, heroin,
prostitution,

20:57.540 --> 20:58.490
the works!

20:59.150 --> 21:01.310
But I swear, I didn't know.

21:01.700 --> 21:04.610
And when I found out, they threatened
to expose me.

21:09.230 --> 21:10.800
Tell me that that's
not what you've been doing.

21:11.820 --> 21:13.800
Tell me that that's
not where the money came from.

21:14.010 --> 21:15.670
You have to understand this, Delia.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.720
After I left the military,
we had nothing.

21:19.150 --> 21:21.180
And I wanted to give you so much.

21:21.450 --> 21:23.610
Some contacts in Eastern Europe
made me an offer.

21:24.670 --> 21:26.050
I didn't think.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.890
I kept records
of every transaction.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.800
Names, dates, dollar amounts.

21:31.590 --> 21:32.930
It's all here.

21:34.030 --> 21:35.160
I wanted to bring you here,

21:36.280 --> 21:38.210
because, if I go through with this,

21:38.500 --> 21:40.170
we might not see
each other for a while.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.380
This is the only copy.

21:45.540 --> 21:47.330
Take it, in case anything happens.

21:47.980 --> 21:49.580
I have to put this right.

21:49.870 --> 21:52.080
They're not going to let me just walk away.

21:52.590 --> 21:54.790
I did my job,
I delivered the package.

21:55.150 --> 21:56.290
Our business is done.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.040
Wait!

21:59.290 --> 22:02.590
All I'm asking is that you to drive her
to Paris and put her on a plane.

22:03.430 --> 22:06.600
Get Delia back to her mother
in the U.S.

22:39.870 --> 22:41.500
You must think I'm a total idiot.

22:43.240 --> 22:44.440
What are you talking about?

22:44.870 --> 22:47.360
Apparently, my father is an
international criminal and I never noticed.

22:48.590 --> 22:49.760
It's not your fault.

22:49.990 --> 22:51.660
I went to private school
in Switzerland,

22:51.930 --> 22:54.010
I went on shopping trips
to Paris.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.760
Not once did I question it.

22:58.650 --> 23:01.110
If he testifies, I'm probably never
going to see him again, right?

23:02.210 --> 23:03.230
You don't know that.

23:04.770 --> 23:07.200
You know, you probably saved my life
back there at the hotel.

23:09.060 --> 23:10.900
I was just doing my job.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.890
Delivering a package?

23:15.210 --> 23:16.860
Is that all I am?

23:18.120 --> 23:19.640
No, of course not.

23:47.060 --> 23:50.390
So I'm going to head back into town, and get
everything ready for your meeting with Interpol

23:51.650 --> 23:53.010
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

23:53.490 --> 23:55.890
Don't worry.
Everything is going to be okay.

23:56.590 --> 23:57.360
Hurry back.

24:22.270 --> 24:23.450
Frank.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.140
What the hell is going on?

25:05.180 --> 25:06.890
- Where is my father?
- Delia, don't...

25:16.050 --> 25:18.040
Take the back stairs.
Start the car.

25:18.270 --> 25:20.730
The code is 441 257.

25:20.960 --> 25:21.890
Now go!

25:43.990 --> 25:44.850
Four...

26:03.130 --> 26:03.860
Yes!

26:22.410 --> 26:23.140
Drive!

26:27.660 --> 26:28.460
Where are we going?

26:28.720 --> 26:31.080
My house.
Then I'll get you to Paris.

26:31.340 --> 26:33.110
- Who are those people?
- I don't know.

26:33.340 --> 26:36.590
I guess your father's ex-partners.
Somebody tipped them off.

26:37.660 --> 26:39.750
They're going to try to kill me
as well, aren't they?

27:11.260 --> 27:12.500
I can't believe this.

27:12.910 --> 27:16.070
He was part of this
whole criminal network.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.090
He didn't start out
meaning for that to happen.

27:20.290 --> 27:22.790
Everything I thought about him
was a lie.

27:25.040 --> 27:25.900
He loved you.

27:27.070 --> 27:28.090
Really?

27:29.190 --> 27:31.840
Or is that just what he said,
so he could sleep at night.

27:32.130 --> 27:33.310
A justification.

27:34.130 --> 27:35.840
Look, I'm gonna do what he wanted.

27:36.350 --> 27:37.840
I'm gonna screw these guys to the wall.

27:38.070 --> 27:40.370
These aren't small-time mobsters
we're talking about.

27:40.630 --> 27:41.650
I'm not afraid.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.030
Well, you should be!

27:44.760 --> 27:46.440
Erase that thing.
Walk away.

27:49.720 --> 27:50.840
I can't

27:52.850 --> 27:53.710
Come here.

27:59.320 --> 28:00.910
You're safe here, okay?

28:04.970 --> 28:06.870
Why don't you get yourself cleaned up?
The laundry's over there.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.740
The bathroom is that way.

28:09.720 --> 28:12.740
I've got some business to take care of,
but I'll be back in a little while.

28:14.220 --> 28:15.620
Everything's gonna be okay.

28:16.690 --> 28:18.090
You have to believe me.

29:34.940 --> 29:35.550
Carla.

29:35.780 --> 29:36.900
I got the transfer.

29:37.130 --> 29:38.590
There's a lot of information.

29:38.850 --> 29:40.550
- Names?
- It looks like it's all coded.

29:40.780 --> 29:41.930
Let me see what I can find.

29:43.380 --> 29:44.210
Where are you headed?

29:44.630 --> 29:46.060
I've got some business to clear up.

29:46.320 --> 29:48.300
Not that waitress at the
Metropole again?

29:49.630 --> 29:51.870
Carla, really,
there are rules.

30:26.660 --> 30:27.550
Who are you?

30:27.780 --> 30:29.180
Inspector Tarconi.

30:29.690 --> 30:31.280
I was just looking for Frank.

30:31.660 --> 30:33.150
Well, Frank's not here.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.830
So I can see.

30:37.380 --> 30:39.770
I'm sorry... I surprised you

30:40.030 --> 30:42.210
But I wasn't expecting
to find anyone here.

30:42.470 --> 30:44.310
Frank doesn't usually
have many visitors.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.180
You know him well?

30:49.310 --> 30:50.080
No. What about you?

30:51.590 --> 30:52.490
Not so much,

30:52.750 --> 30:54.990
but I think, perhaps,
this is how he prefers it.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.590
I understand.
The girl and the driver got away.

31:11.340 --> 31:12.050
We've got a name.

31:12.500 --> 31:14.400
Someone who should be able
to lead us right to them.

31:15.310 --> 31:16.000
Let's hope so.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.680
Just a minute.
I'll be right back, Inspector.

31:42.030 --> 31:43.550
Hey Mom, it's Delia.

31:43.970 --> 31:45.300
Honey, are you okay?

31:48.060 --> 31:49.430
They killed him.

31:50.370 --> 31:52.330
Mom, they killed Dad.
I was there, I saw it.

31:53.840 --> 31:56.270
- Are you safe?
- Yeah, yeah, for the moment.

31:56.500 --> 31:57.190
Where are you?

31:58.910 --> 32:01.860
Some friend of Dad got me out of there.
I'm at his house.

32:02.120 --> 32:04.580
I need you to come home Delia,
do you hear me?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.490
- I can't.
- No, listen to me!

32:07.190 --> 32:08.890
I want you to get to
the nearest airport

32:09.160 --> 32:11.500
and the first flight out of there,
I want you on it, do you hear me?

32:13.030 --> 32:14.390
Delia, do you hear me?

32:17.160 --> 32:18.300
I'm really scared, Mommy.

32:18.530 --> 32:19.610
I know you are honey, okay.

32:19.870 --> 32:20.930
It's going to be fine.

32:21.190 --> 32:22.460
Please, just go.

32:22.720 --> 32:25.610
Get to the airport and call me
when you're booking your flight.

32:25.870 --> 32:26.670
I love you, honey.

32:44.690 --> 32:46.140
I need a taxi.

32:55.190 --> 32:57.550
Dieter,
I brought you something.

32:58.750 --> 32:59.550
No, Frank!

32:59.870 --> 33:00.860
Come on.

33:01.470 --> 33:03.060
I got you something from Berlin.

33:04.310 --> 33:05.960
You have something for me?

33:09.030 --> 33:10.170
Absolutely not!

33:10.530 --> 33:12.550
You can't take this car.

33:14.030 --> 33:15.020
Okay then.

33:15.560 --> 33:18.490
If you think you can bribe me with a  case
of (indistinct) beer, you are wrong.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.700
How could you possibly know that?

33:23.180 --> 33:26.200
I'm a German. I can smell beer inside a closed bottle.

33:27.750 --> 33:28.830
So, is it a deal?

33:29.590 --> 33:32.840
No, You beat these cars half to death.
I can't let that happen to the new one.

33:38.180 --> 33:39.200
I won't take it on a job,
I promise.

33:39.620 --> 33:41.050
Don't promise, what you can't keep.

33:41.310 --> 33:42.110
I never do.

33:42.340 --> 33:43.550
I trust you, Frank,

33:43.810 --> 33:46.330
but the people you know,
they make me nervous.

33:49.370 --> 33:50.450
Fair enough.

33:54.340 --> 33:55.550
Think about it though, okay?

33:56.430 --> 33:57.420
I will.

34:20.810 --> 34:22.420
I broke part of this code.

34:22.650 --> 34:24.020
There is a name that comes up
again and again.

34:24.370 --> 34:25.730
Frieder Trumpf.

34:26.370 --> 34:27.330
Sounds familiar.

34:27.590 --> 34:29.550
He's a major crime operator
out of Berlin.

34:29.810 --> 34:32.449
There's enough in these files to put
Frieder away for a long time.

34:33.179 --> 34:34.770
He'll go after Delia.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.449
Hi Delia, it's me, Fiona.

34:44.679 --> 34:46.610
I've been trying to reach your father.

34:47.739 --> 34:49.010
He's at the house.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.580
They broke into the house.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.050
What? When?

34:52.280 --> 34:53.360
Who broke in? When?

34:53.739 --> 34:56.110
They were shooting,
and they wouldn't stop.

34:56.590 --> 34:57.980
They killed my dad.

35:00.650 --> 35:02.550
Delia, are you all right?

35:02.780 --> 35:04.140
I'm going home.

35:05.030 --> 35:06.620
I want to see you, before you go.

35:06.870 --> 35:09.010
Hotel Suisse, in 20 minutes.

35:11.430 --> 35:12.310
Thank you.

35:12.820 --> 35:13.870
It's okay, Delia.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.150
Hello, Inspector.

35:32.410 --> 35:34.930
I hope you brought cream.
You're all out.

35:36.260 --> 35:37.590
- Where's the girl?
- Delia?

35:38.470 --> 35:39.460
Charming young lady.

35:40.000 --> 35:40.710
Where is she?

35:40.970 --> 35:43.970
She's gone,
she said she didn't feel safe anymore.

35:44.220 --> 35:44.840
What?

35:54.500 --> 35:56.400
_

35:57.570 --> 35:58.210
Shit!

36:03.660 --> 36:05.560
Carla,
I need a trace on Delia's phone.

36:37.630 --> 36:39.310
Thank god, you're all right.

36:39.780 --> 36:40.430
My dad...

36:40.690 --> 36:42.650
I know,
we need to get you out of here.

36:42.880 --> 36:44.090
Do you have the drive?

36:44.320 --> 36:45.500
Yes, it's right here.

36:46.690 --> 36:48.710
Good.
Let's go, the car is over here.

36:59.410 --> 37:00.740
Don't scream, or he'll shoot!

37:05.470 --> 37:07.270
Give me the bag.
Get in!

37:12.720 --> 37:13.710
Let's go!

37:16.190 --> 37:18.430
Frank, last call is from
Hotel Suisse.

37:18.780 --> 37:19.520
I'm nearly there.

37:25.440 --> 37:26.400
I'm here.

37:27.030 --> 37:28.300
I don't see her.

37:31.190 --> 37:32.930
Can you tap into
the hotel security cameras?

37:33.160 --> 37:34.240
That shouldn't be a problem.

37:42.220 --> 37:45.020
Frank, she's been kidnapped
from right outside the hotel.

37:45.500 --> 37:46.580
I got a license plate.

37:47.380 --> 37:49.490
- Can you run it?
- Already happening, Frank.

37:58.030 --> 37:58.550
Anything?

37:58.810 --> 38:01.150
The van's registered
to one of Frieder Trumpf's guys.

38:01.910 --> 38:04.300
- You said Trumpf was in Berlin.
- That was yesterday.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.240
The guy who rented the van,

38:06.470 --> 38:08.360
he rents a small airfield
just outside of town.

38:08.590 --> 38:09.520
That's where she is, Frank.

38:09.970 --> 38:11.270
I'm sending you the location.

38:21.780 --> 38:23.990
I checked the files.
It's all there.

38:25.190 --> 38:27.550
How did you know my dad
gave me the files?

38:28.000 --> 38:30.210
I had the room bugged.
I heard the whole thing.

38:30.750 --> 38:32.110
She's got nothing else on us.

38:32.340 --> 38:34.270
Well, we don't know what she knows.
Who she might have spoken to.

38:34.500 --> 38:35.860
But I need to find out.

38:37.160 --> 38:38.590
Hey, you've done commendable job.

38:38.840 --> 38:40.270
But I should take it from here.

38:47.720 --> 38:49.110
I wanna show you something.

38:50.880 --> 38:52.310
I just acquired it.

38:55.970 --> 38:56.830
This...

38:57.280 --> 39:00.030
once was used by
Wilhelm Furtw?ngler,

39:00.410 --> 39:02.210
he was the last
German Musical Director...

39:02.470 --> 39:04.360
...of the Berlin
Symphonic Orchestra.

39:09.440 --> 39:10.430
Hold still.

39:11.780 --> 39:12.830
Hold still.

39:15.910 --> 39:16.520
Now...

39:20.940 --> 39:24.020
Are you ready to tell me
what I need to know?

39:25.410 --> 39:27.580
Why don't you take that thing
and shove it up your ass!

39:34.780 --> 39:35.830
May I speak to Delia, please.

39:36.470 --> 39:39.070
Oh, I'm afraid
she's preoccupied at the moment.

39:39.780 --> 39:41.870
- You'll have to call back.
- This will only take a second.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.300
You wouldn't happen to be Frieder,
would you?

39:44.190 --> 39:45.780
Frieder Trumpf from Berlin?

39:46.000 --> 39:47.430
You must be the driver, yeah?

39:47.780 --> 39:49.080
I prefer "transporter".

40:03.560 --> 40:05.420
You are gonna sit down here, okay.

40:06.340 --> 40:07.240
Enjoy the flight.

40:20.970 --> 40:22.050
Are we ready to take off immediately?

40:22.500 --> 40:23.390
Yes sir.

41:32.340 --> 41:33.980
- What the hell?
- What are you doing?

41:43.520 --> 41:45.290
I want this plane in the air. Now!

41:54.210 --> 41:56.120
We have a fire in one of the engines.
We need to get the hell outta here.

41:56.460 --> 41:57.820
You are going nowhere.

43:04.090 --> 43:06.680
Officials remain tight-lipped
about the incident.

43:06.940 --> 43:09.280
But according to a source
inside the French police,

43:09.530 --> 43:11.670
three bodies were found
in the wreckage.

43:11.940 --> 43:14.080
The first has been identified
as Frieder Trumpf,

43:14.310 --> 43:15.670
55, of Berlin.

43:15.940 --> 43:18.530
A man with known connection to
several criminal organizations.

43:19.120 --> 43:20.860
The second body is yet
to be identified,

43:21.120 --> 43:23.950
is that of a young woman,
believed to be in her early 20's.

43:24.750 --> 43:26.120
- Nice.
- Good.

43:29.001 --> 43:31.950
So, I'm dead, then.

43:32.400 --> 43:36.800
It was the only way to be sure
they wouldn't keep looking for you.

43:36.880 --> 43:37.380
Your taxi is waiting.

43:37.400 --> 43:40.700
But I told them that this is an
official police business, so..

43:40.702 --> 43:40.900
take your time.

43:41.090 --> 43:42.070
Thank you.

43:45.430 --> 43:47.500
Are you sure you won't stay?

43:47.900 --> 43:49.700
Because you are more than welcome.

43:53.270 --> 43:54.260
I can't, really.

43:59.010 --> 44:01.050
Perhaps I would go
water bougainvillea.

44:10.030 --> 44:11.750
I guess this is
au revoir.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.850
Are you sure this is how
you wanna live your life?

44:20.980 --> 44:21.490
Just take care of yourself.

44:33.130 --> 44:35.150
I was gonna say the same to you.
