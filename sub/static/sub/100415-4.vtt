Heard that, scrote.

03:46.268 --> 03:47.937
(phone rings)

03:47.978 --> 03:49.980
-You're up bright and early.
-Took a hard look

03:50.022 --> 03:51.273
at that so-called confession.

03:51.315 --> 03:53.108
It's bogus.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.485
Not his M.O.

03:54.526 --> 03:57.237
Olmer was a serial rapist,
not a murderer.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.448
Well, he could have graduated
to it. Natural progression.

03:59.490 --> 04:02.368
Olmer claims he climbed
Skyler's balcony,

04:02.409 --> 04:04.995
slipped through
an unlocked sliding door.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.039
How he attacked
his rape victims.

04:07.081 --> 04:10.042
The railing was covered with a
layer of soot, so was the deck.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.753
No handprints, no footprints.
No one came in from the balcony.

04:12.795 --> 04:15.047
Good. What else?

04:15.089 --> 04:16.966
No mention of the carving knife.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.425
Carving knife?

04:18.467 --> 04:20.427
Used it to mutilate her,
postmortem.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.721
-(sighs): Good God.
-We held it back

04:22.763 --> 04:24.348
to weed out
the false confessions.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.558
-Like this one.
-There's nothing
in there that wasn't

04:26.600 --> 04:29.019
in the papers at the time
or came out later at trial.

04:29.061 --> 04:31.563
Okay. The confession's a fake.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.607
Motive aside for now.

04:33.649 --> 04:35.484
-Whose idea?
-Who benefits?

04:35.526 --> 04:36.819
Well, Borders, obviously.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.779
Cronyn, if there's a settlement.

04:38.821 --> 04:41.365
-Olmer confessed to Cronyn.
-Allegedly.

04:41.407 --> 04:42.992
There's no audio, no video.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.243
Just the document.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.577
There was a witness.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.496
The corrections officer.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.498
I'll have Hector chase him down.

04:49.540 --> 04:52.042
You need a badge
to get to him, remember?

04:53.377 --> 04:55.879
Tread lightly.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.782
(phone ringing in distance)

05:51.018 --> 05:53.062
He'll show.
Comes every morning,

05:53.103 --> 05:55.314
truck full of soda cans
and scrap metal.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.775
Yeah, and whatever else
he can get his hands on.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.985
Peanut's industrious--
you got to give him that.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.737
One word for it.

06:01.779 --> 06:04.281
I've known Peanut a long time--
he's no carjacker.

06:04.323 --> 06:05.866
That you know of.

06:05.908 --> 06:07.576
(sighs)
What's this one about?

06:07.618 --> 06:09.953
Oh. Alert the media.

06:09.995 --> 06:13.791
Two panhandlers fighting
over a chunk of sidewalk.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.169

HOBBS:

06:20.005 --> 06:21.173
It's my spot.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.008
Ask anybody. It's my spot.

06:23.050 --> 06:26.887
Don't you guys have agreements,
who's got what spot?

06:26.929 --> 06:28.222
Exactly.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.682
And what makes this spot...

06:30.724 --> 06:33.477
more special than,
say, any other spot?

06:33.519 --> 06:35.813
It's my spot. I mean,
it's got the coffee shop,

06:35.854 --> 06:37.189
it's got the stoplight.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.274
And besides that?

06:39.316 --> 06:40.651
Besides that, people know me.

06:40.692 --> 06:41.902
CRATE:
He says...

06:41.944 --> 06:45.072
you pushed him first.

06:45.114 --> 06:46.532
Look at the size of that dude.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.158
He attacked me.

06:48.200 --> 06:52.162
Mm-kay. So why can't you
find another spot?

06:52.204 --> 06:53.580
Fuck that.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.499
I was there first.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.251
Ah.

06:57.292 --> 06:59.336
BARREL: The young lady
in the coffee shop

06:59.378 --> 07:01.463
filmed this whole thing
on her phone.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.674
But that don't matter.
It's like you say.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.135
It's understood.
It's my spot.

07:06.176 --> 07:09.012
Sorry, pal.
Next time, get there first.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.597
Early bird, worm...

07:10.639 --> 07:13.976
If he's there tomorrow,
in my spot...

07:14.017 --> 07:16.228
ain't no telling
what could happen.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.397
Don't tell me that.
Don't go there.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.982
Could be mayhem.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.776
Work with me here.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.256
Maddie Bosch?

07:44.298 --> 07:45.883
Short on clerks this week.

07:45.924 --> 07:48.635
Need you to sit in
on witness prep, take notes.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.221
-Okay. Not a problem.
-I'd hope not.

Fucked it up first

08:17.623 --> 08:19.208

08:19.249 --> 08:22.628
You can see the cartilage
is practically oatmeal.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.214
-When did you dislocate it?
-Kandahar, '02.

08:25.255 --> 08:28.008
Just jumping in and out
of those APCs,

08:28.050 --> 08:29.218
humping 60 pounds
of battle rattle.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.302
Well, the range of motion's

08:30.344 --> 08:31.678
a little loose, so...

08:31.720 --> 08:33.263
I'm gonna write you
a prescription

08:33.305 --> 08:35.641
for extra-strength ibuprofen.

08:35.682 --> 08:36.934
Yeah, uh, Doc,

08:36.975 --> 08:38.560
that's like fucking aspirin.

08:38.602 --> 08:40.604
I need something
a little stronger.

08:42.689 --> 08:46.193
(sighs)
How long you been off the oxy?

08:46.235 --> 08:47.819
Six weeks, two days.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.488
Mr. Reilly,
you been off for that long,

08:49.529 --> 08:51.490
you're well on your way
to being off it for good.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.951
Yeah, Doc, my knee hurts
like a bastard.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.869
Oxy's the only thing that helps.

08:55.911 --> 08:58.121
-What dosage were you taking?
-80.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.457
That's high.
Who prescribed it?

09:00.499 --> 09:02.709
I don't remember his name.

09:02.751 --> 09:03.919
Where was this?

09:03.961 --> 09:05.170
-V.A.
-Here?

09:05.212 --> 09:07.798
Nevada. That a problem?

09:07.839 --> 09:09.132
Not at all.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.634
As long as I can look up
your prescription history...

09:10.676 --> 09:13.512
Yeah, well, I'm telling it
to you right now.

09:13.553 --> 09:17.099
My mistake.
Maybe it wasn't the V.A.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.980
You know, I lead
a pain management group.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.107
Why don't you come by?

09:25.148 --> 09:27.067
-Group?
-Yeah.

09:27.109 --> 09:28.527
You meet other vets
going through

09:28.568 --> 09:29.945
the same thing
you're going through.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.571
They're learning
to manage their pain

09:31.613 --> 09:33.031
-without addiction.
-Yeah, I don't know, Doc.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.199
I'm-I'm not good with crowds.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.367
Well, that's the way

09:35.409 --> 09:36.493
we do things now.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.453
No more opioids.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.497
You want to live, right?

09:41.957 --> 09:43.375
(softly):
Yeah.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.543
Good.

09:46.628 --> 09:47.629
There he is.

09:47.671 --> 09:48.922
About time.

09:50.007 --> 09:51.842
(engine starts)

10:00.934 --> 10:02.311
Peanut!

10:02.352 --> 10:04.062
Don't even think about it.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.067
Come on, Dotson.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.278
What, you stalking me, man?

10:11.320 --> 10:13.196
I-I pissed clean for you
a week ago.

10:13.238 --> 10:16.074
So why were you about to rabbit,
you're so law-abiding and all?

10:16.116 --> 10:18.243
I don't know.
Muscle memory?

10:18.285 --> 10:20.746
Muscle memory.
Good one.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.664
This is Detective Robertson.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.624
LAPD, Homicide.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.126
Hell, I ain't killed nobody.

10:26.168 --> 10:28.420
Convince me.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.345
-Why so public?
-Listen, Gary insisted.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.889
-It was his call.
-Said he felt safer.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.599
Somebody must have
seen him with you.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.267
Gary knew the game.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.353
He's been out of the game
a long time.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.645
Gary was never hard-core.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.522
Who's lead on this at RHD?

10:47.564 --> 10:49.733
Conniff and Espinoza.

10:49.775 --> 10:51.902
We'll reach out.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.987
I hope to God
they got something, man,

10:54.029 --> 10:55.447
'cause we got nothing.

10:55.489 --> 10:58.158
I'll follow up with his dad.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.369
He was on the job.
D2, South Bureau.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.953
Narcotics.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.038
Dwight Wise?

11:03.080 --> 11:05.207
That was before our time.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.460
Let us know if Pops
has any ideas.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.711
Mm.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.846
HANSEN:
Have you been doing

11:19.888 --> 11:21.390
your mindfulness exercises,
Louis?

11:21.431 --> 11:22.974
(chuckles)

11:23.016 --> 11:25.644
Be present
and let my mind wander?

11:25.685 --> 11:28.647
That's some scary shit, Doc.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.149
Last week you said you're
gonna do your best to go out

11:31.191 --> 11:32.651
-for a walk.
-I got...

11:32.692 --> 11:34.986
my back, there's
fucking spasms, man.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.696
Have you been going to work?

11:36.738 --> 11:38.824
That just aggravates
the situation.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.784
It sucks to be you.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.412
How's your sleep?

11:43.453 --> 11:45.664
Sleep? I don't sleep.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.542
I toss and turn all night.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.001
I'm so fucking exhausted.
I mean, I-I don't even

11:50.043 --> 11:51.711
want to get out of bed
in the morning.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.965
Yeah? But...
you made it here today.

11:56.299 --> 11:57.759
What?

11:57.801 --> 12:00.095
All you do is whine.

12:00.137 --> 12:02.013
What are you, a ray of sunshine?

12:02.055 --> 12:03.348
Least I don't bitch about it.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.601
But he asked me a question.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.729
Uh, hey, Doc?

12:10.939 --> 12:12.566
Look, man, like I told you,

12:12.607 --> 12:14.860
this shit's
not gonna work for me.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.028
(sighs)
It takes time. Trust me.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.239
You say so.
Can you give me

12:19.281 --> 12:21.450
a little something
to tide me over?

12:21.491 --> 12:23.952
Give it 30 days, Mr. Reilly.

12:23.994 --> 12:26.288
You'll see a change,
I promise you.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.415
Another month of this shit?

12:28.457 --> 12:30.917
Listen, we'll revisit
your situation then.

12:30.959 --> 12:33.044
But until then,
take the ibuprofen,

12:33.086 --> 12:35.172
try to stay off the oxy.

12:35.213 --> 12:36.548
Okay?

12:57.819 --> 12:59.154
(speaking indistinctly)

12:59.196 --> 13:01.364
Just get in the fucking car...

13:14.211 --> 13:16.004
DEFENSE ATTORNEY:
The defendant has

13:16.046 --> 13:18.006
strong ties to the community,

13:18.048 --> 13:21.343
is employed full-time,
and has no reason to flee.

13:21.384 --> 13:24.179
So she intends to contest
these charges vigorously.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.515
-Ms. Loring?
-Thank you, Your Honor.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.600
The People object
to any deviation downward

13:28.642 --> 13:30.018
from the bail schedule.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.229
This defendant is likely
to lose her employment,

13:32.270 --> 13:35.106
since she is charged
with stealing from her employer.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.900
It is the People's position

13:36.942 --> 13:40.195
that she is a flight risk,
and we ask for appropriate bail.

13:40.237 --> 13:42.697
JUDGE:
Bail is set at $100,000.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.116
The court will take
a 15-minute recess.

13:59.548 --> 14:01.424
Buick Century.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.426
Year?

14:03.468 --> 14:05.136
2003.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.555
You know your cars.

14:06.596 --> 14:07.806
I do.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.809
This particular
2003 Buick Century--

14:10.850 --> 14:13.520
found your prints all over it.

14:13.562 --> 14:15.814
Well, um...

14:15.855 --> 14:18.233
it-it might not be
the-the-the same car, 'cause,

14:18.275 --> 14:21.695
uh, the other night,
me and my boy Beansie, we was...

14:21.736 --> 14:24.781
we was just chilling,
you know, having some beers,

14:24.823 --> 14:27.033
and we were by some cars,
but we were just...

14:27.075 --> 14:28.827
we were just leaning
against them.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.954
You know, we-we was talking.

14:30.996 --> 14:32.789
-Just leaning on 'em?
-Yeah, man.

14:32.831 --> 14:33.873
Just shooting the shit.

14:33.915 --> 14:36.001
We found your prints
inside the car.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.628
This vehicle was used

14:38.670 --> 14:40.714
in a homicide--
makes you an accessory.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.465
Accessory to what?

14:42.507 --> 14:44.634
Carjacking, kidnapping.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.011
-Whoa.
-Murder.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.387
Whoa, man!

14:47.429 --> 14:49.139
I told you,
I ain't killed nobody.

14:49.180 --> 14:52.434
Beansie. What's Beansie's
last name? He a felon, too?

14:52.475 --> 14:54.603
-I don't know.
-You don't know his last name,
your boy Beansie?

14:54.644 --> 14:56.730
-I don't know.
-You don't know, you don't know.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.898
So how about we
go grab your boy Beansie

14:58.940 --> 15:01.067
and check out
this bullshit story of yours?

15:01.109 --> 15:03.194
He's a felon,
you're going back to prison.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.071
Come on, man,
don't do me like that.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.157
Hey, you'll do a bullet.
But if you're mixed up

15:07.198 --> 15:09.284
in this other thing,
you'll get old and die there.

15:09.326 --> 15:11.870
Come on, man, I was just
taking parts off the cars.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.664
-That's it?
-I swear to God.

15:14.706 --> 15:16.875
It-it was a demolition
down on Center Street.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.336
You know, I was...
I was copper-mining,

15:19.377 --> 15:21.755
I seen these two white dudes,
they dumped the Buick,

15:21.796 --> 15:24.591
tossed the keys,
and walked away.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.593
What'd they look like?

15:26.635 --> 15:27.761
White.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.846
(chuckles softly)
I got that.

15:29.888 --> 15:32.432
-Tall? Short?
-One was taller.

15:32.474 --> 15:35.060
He was, like, big,
like one of them UFC dudes.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.936
-The other guy?
-Um, average.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.481
Just average white guy.
You know.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.608
So you went back
and stripped it?

15:41.650 --> 15:44.986
Come on, man. Yo, this some
helpful shit I'm giving you.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.905
You're not even
really gonna violate me

15:46.946 --> 15:48.907
over some stolen Buick parts.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.743
Don't disrespect me like that.

Well, you only have two.
Which one?

19:16.030 --> 19:17.156
Joy.

19:17.198 --> 19:19.158
I think someone from the group

19:19.200 --> 19:21.327
could get us
to the Garcia Clinic.

19:21.369 --> 19:22.912
I'll look over

Louis-- he was peddling pills

19:25.164 --> 19:28.042
-in the parking lot
after the session.
-What's this?

19:28.084 --> 19:30.670
That's stuff
from the Skyler murder.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.135

19:40.930 --> 19:42.557
a few weeks earlier
for no reason.

19:42.599 --> 19:45.143
-For what? Being a douche?
-No, he was the lead suspect.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.061
We were keeping an eye on him.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.772
But I can't find any record of
this supposed arrest anywhere.

19:49.814 --> 19:52.525
So I pulled the DFARs
from archives.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.944
-Gonna have a look-see.
-Damn.

-No stone unturned, brother.
-Why they call you the Grinder.

25:43.918 --> 25:46.545
-It's not anywhere in the files.
-IRVING: The arrest

25:46.587 --> 25:47.755
was premature.

25:47.797 --> 25:49.674
We didn't yet have
probable cause.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.175
Why you didn't have Servidone
write it up.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.177
Borders was our prime suspect.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.346
I didn't want to lose him
on a technicality.

25:55.388 --> 25:57.556
No, I get it. Thanks, Chief.

26:01.769 --> 26:04.230
CRATE: Yeah, yeah.
Thing's a hundred years old.

26:04.272 --> 26:05.940
So you should be able to fix it,

26:05.982 --> 26:07.900
since you were around
when it was brand-new.

26:07.942 --> 26:10.569
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

26:10.611 --> 26:13.739
It got jammed up how, exactly?

26:13.781 --> 26:16.575
I don't know.

26:16.617 --> 26:17.618
(sighs)

26:17.660 --> 26:19.704
-(grunts)
-Okay, okay.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.206
-I've got it.
-(sighs)

26:22.248 --> 26:24.083
You realize each of these

26:24.125 --> 26:26.294
is an individual drop-off
at the City Attorney's Office.

26:26.335 --> 26:29.630
Well, thank you, this being
my first day on the job and all.

26:29.672 --> 26:31.632
Oh, here's a tip.

26:31.674 --> 26:34.135
Next time, take the staple out.

26:34.176 --> 26:35.386
(groans)

26:35.428 --> 26:37.221
I didn't see it, okay?

26:37.263 --> 26:39.348
(quietly):
There's a shock.

26:41.517 --> 26:43.853
Something you want to say to me?

26:46.022 --> 26:49.400
That's what I thought.

26:49.442 --> 26:51.235
You...

26:51.277 --> 26:53.321
never saw...

26:53.362 --> 26:54.989
the car.

26:55.031 --> 26:56.490
Tell me I'm wrong.

26:56.532 --> 26:57.908
Admit it.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.994
You never even heard me.

27:00.036 --> 27:02.413
You just blew
through the intersection.

27:02.455 --> 27:04.290
Go fuck yourself.

27:04.332 --> 27:05.708
-Oh.
-Gentlemen,

27:05.750 --> 27:07.710
what the hell is going on?

27:07.752 --> 27:10.004
I'm done here.

27:15.551 --> 27:18.763
I'll have
some general questions first.

27:18.804 --> 27:20.598
When it happened,

27:20.639 --> 27:22.516
where.

27:22.558 --> 27:25.519
And then I'll ask you
to point him out.

27:25.561 --> 27:28.397
It's the only time
you'll have to look at him.

27:28.439 --> 27:29.899
Okay.

27:29.940 --> 27:32.151
Now, when you're up there
on the stand,

27:32.193 --> 27:34.153
if it gets emotional,

27:34.195 --> 27:35.613
if you get emotional...

27:35.654 --> 27:37.031
Don't expect me to cry.

27:37.073 --> 27:40.117
All I'm saying is
that it's okay to feel

27:40.159 --> 27:42.620
-whatever you feel.
-I've had plenty of time
for that.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.538
I'm done crying.

27:53.631 --> 27:54.924
BOSCH:
Bosch.

27:54.965 --> 27:56.926
Sanchez, D.O.C. Corcoran.

27:56.967 --> 28:00.304
Told to call you
about inmate Lucas John Olmer.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.223
Yeah, thanks
for getting back to me.

28:02.264 --> 28:05.142
Did you witness his confession?

28:05.184 --> 28:06.727
-No, that's not accurate.
-It isn't?

28:06.769 --> 28:08.979
I witnessed him sign a piece
of paper. I don't know what

28:09.021 --> 28:10.564
-that was.
-You didn't read it?

28:10.606 --> 28:11.732
No, sir, I did not.

28:11.774 --> 28:13.067
I saw his lawyer read it to him,

28:13.109 --> 28:14.402
through the glass.

28:14.443 --> 28:15.403
Cronyn.

28:15.444 --> 28:16.737
Then he called me in.

28:16.779 --> 28:18.030
As a witness.

28:18.072 --> 28:19.031
Correct.

28:19.073 --> 28:20.241
I gloved up and went in.

28:20.282 --> 28:22.743
Olmer signed, the lawyer signed,
then I signed.

28:22.785 --> 28:24.578
Witnessed the signatures.
That's all.

28:24.620 --> 28:25.788
Why the gloves?

28:25.830 --> 28:26.956
Olmer had MRSA.

28:26.997 --> 28:28.457
I didn't want to fuck around
with that.

28:28.499 --> 28:30.292
Think he knew
what he was signing?

28:30.334 --> 28:31.293
He was dying.

28:31.335 --> 28:32.336
Doped to the gills.

28:32.378 --> 28:33.421
Barely hold the pen.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.089
Cronyn wearing gloves, too?

28:35.131 --> 28:37.091
Gloves and a mask.

28:37.133 --> 28:38.676
Okay, Sanchez.

28:38.717 --> 28:39.677
Thanks a lot.

28:39.718 --> 28:40.678
Not a problem.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.471
Have a good one.

28:47.268 --> 28:49.270
(grunts)

28:51.355 --> 28:53.691
Look, I haven't seen Jose
in weeks.

28:53.732 --> 28:57.111
That wasn't you and cuz
other night at the Doyers game?

28:57.153 --> 28:59.029
Instagram, dawg.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.031
Word to the wise:

29:01.073 --> 29:03.701
you're on the run,
best not be posting.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.745
We can find you,
bad guys can, too.

29:09.623 --> 29:11.584
He came to me a couple days ago.

29:11.625 --> 29:13.544
Scared shitless.

29:13.586 --> 29:14.962
Needed to get out of town.

29:15.004 --> 29:16.088
He say why?

29:16.130 --> 29:18.090
My uncle's murder.

29:18.132 --> 29:19.550
Said the same guys
were after him, too.

29:19.592 --> 29:21.177
You help him out?

29:22.219 --> 29:23.471
Loaned him my car.

29:23.512 --> 29:24.597
Where'd he go?

29:24.638 --> 29:25.598
Bakersfield.

29:25.639 --> 29:26.849
My sister Rosie's.

29:26.891 --> 29:28.476
He there now?

29:28.517 --> 29:29.727
I don't know.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.312
I haven't heard from him.

29:31.353 --> 29:33.314
He tossed his phone.
Worried about

29:33.355 --> 29:35.274
-being tracked.
-You talk to your sister?

29:35.316 --> 29:38.402
I tried calling her,
but she's not answering.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.321
That doesn't concern you?

29:42.156 --> 29:43.699
It's starting to.

29:43.741 --> 29:45.451
Hope we don't have to go
to Bakersfield.

29:45.493 --> 29:47.369
-Ever been?
-No.

29:47.411 --> 29:48.954
Don't knock it.

29:48.996 --> 29:50.372
Serious?

29:50.414 --> 29:51.957
The Bakersfield sound.

29:51.999 --> 29:54.585
Buck Owens. Merle Haggard.

29:54.627 --> 29:56.170
"Mama Tried."

29:56.212 --> 29:58.756
"The Bottle Let Me Down."
"Life in Prison."

29:58.797 --> 30:00.424
Classic honky-tonk, Pierce.

30:00.466 --> 30:01.759
Honky-tonk?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.594
Like country music?

30:03.636 --> 30:05.346
You got to broaden
your horizons.

30:05.387 --> 30:06.972
Four hours round-trip.

30:07.014 --> 30:08.224
Let's call first.

30:08.265 --> 30:09.642
I know a cop up there.

30:09.683 --> 30:11.852
Maybe she can get a bead
on our boy.

30:11.894 --> 30:13.687
It'll be fun.

30:13.729 --> 30:14.688
Teach you how to line dance.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.023
-Texas two-step.
-Mm-mm.

30:16.065 --> 30:18.901
-Don't knock it till you try it.
-(laughs)

30:32.248 --> 30:35.376
Look at you with the gag walk.

30:35.417 --> 30:38.587
Just a poor boy
down on his luck.

30:43.676 --> 30:44.969
Louis Degner.

30:45.010 --> 30:46.136
Double-dipper.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.763
V.A., Garcia Clinic.

30:47.805 --> 30:50.182
Still working
on those sobriety coins.

30:50.224 --> 30:51.308
Where is he?

30:51.350 --> 30:52.393
Around the corner.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.144
How do you want to do this?

30:54.186 --> 30:57.147
I don't think he's gonna give us
a problem, but...

30:57.189 --> 30:59.400
set up down the block
in case he gets froggy.

30:59.441 --> 31:01.110
Copy that.

31:10.744 --> 31:11.954
(dog barking in distance)

31:11.996 --> 31:13.998
Louis.

31:16.458 --> 31:19.086
Louis.
Dominic Reilly from the V.A.

31:19.128 --> 31:20.588
You in there?

31:20.629 --> 31:23.549
(thud)

31:27.303 --> 31:29.638
Louis.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.640
Louis, you in here?

31:32.683 --> 31:34.685
Louis, what are you doing?

31:34.727 --> 31:36.478
-The fuck are you doing here?
-Yo, what the fuck

31:36.520 --> 31:38.564
-are you doing to her?
-Let go of me, asshole!

31:38.606 --> 31:41.650
She OD'd. It's Narcan.

31:41.692 --> 31:42.526
(click)

31:42.568 --> 31:44.236
(grunts)
Call 911!

31:46.155 --> 31:48.574
Jesus.

31:49.742 --> 31:50.701
BOSCH:
She breathing?

31:50.743 --> 31:52.119
DEGNER:
Jesus Christ.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.707
(phone rings)

31:56.749 --> 31:57.708
Billets.

31:57.750 --> 31:58.917
ROBERTSON:
Hey, L.T.

31:58.959 --> 32:01.337
It's Jimmy.

32:01.378 --> 32:03.339
Sorry to bother you.
I tried Harry.

32:03.380 --> 32:04.757
Uh, he's out in the field.

32:04.798 --> 32:06.592
Hey, listen,
I got a guy who can I.D.

32:06.634 --> 32:08.010
the two men
who dumped that Buick.

32:08.052 --> 32:09.720
Our probable pharmacy shooters.

32:09.762 --> 32:11.221
How good's the description?

32:11.263 --> 32:12.473
Maybe composite good.

32:12.514 --> 32:14.558
(hisses)
Oh, that's a dilemma.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.852
-Thought it might be.
-I mean, Command takes it wide,

32:16.894 --> 32:19.188
I don't have enough bodies
to handle the calls.

32:19.229 --> 32:21.607
Why don't I get my guy to go
ahead and do the composite.

32:21.649 --> 32:23.150
We don't have to release it
right away.

32:23.192 --> 32:24.735
All right. That works.

32:24.777 --> 32:26.070
How's it going?

32:26.111 --> 32:27.071
Slow.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.113
Waiting on ballistics.

32:28.155 --> 32:29.698
Tie the two murders together.

32:29.740 --> 32:30.699
Splendid.

32:30.741 --> 32:33.285
Onward and upward.

32:33.327 --> 32:35.329
(siren wailing)

32:41.251 --> 32:43.170
(siren stops)

32:46.840 --> 32:49.510
-(ambulance doors shut)
-(siren wailing in distance)

32:52.429 --> 32:54.431
(starts engine)

33:05.401 --> 33:07.820
-(dogs barking)
-(siren approaching)

33:14.702 --> 33:16.453
John Law.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.374
EDGAR:
Police.

33:20.416 --> 33:23.585
Do you need assistance?

33:23.627 --> 33:26.588
-What's going on?
-OD.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.383
-Everything's fine now, Officer.
-Does she look fine to you?

33:29.425 --> 33:30.718
PARAMEDIC:
Ma'am.

33:30.759 --> 33:32.553
Ma'am, we've just revived you.

33:32.594 --> 33:34.138
Just leave me.

33:35.889 --> 33:37.182
We're gonna take you
to the hospital, okay?

33:37.224 --> 33:38.517
-Lizzie.
-Don't bother.

33:38.559 --> 33:39.852
Lizzie, it's Louis.
You're gonna be okay.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.604
PARAMEDIC:
Okay.

33:45.399 --> 33:46.942
You the owner?

33:46.984 --> 33:49.153
-Yeah.
-Who is she?

33:49.194 --> 33:50.237
That's my ex.

33:50.279 --> 33:51.572
Let me see some I.D.

33:51.613 --> 33:53.782
You, too, come on.

33:58.412 --> 33:59.997
BOSCH:
Look, man.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.498
He just let her back
in the house

34:01.540 --> 34:03.292
so she could get her shit out
of the kitchen.

34:03.333 --> 34:05.210
Next thing we know,
she's out cold.

34:05.252 --> 34:06.503
Your pupils are dilated.

34:06.545 --> 34:07.671
It's just the adrenaline.

34:11.341 --> 34:14.386
Get her some help.
Before her luck runs out.

34:21.477 --> 34:23.604
You owe me.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.609
You've seen the footage, Chief.

34:28.650 --> 34:30.778
The threat was clear.

34:30.819 --> 34:33.822
I want to know what you saw
in the moment.

34:38.952 --> 34:40.662
Big neighborhood bash.

34:40.704 --> 34:42.706
We arrive, everyone scatters.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.042
Officer Robson gets
on the suspect Vasquez.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.586
He bolts.

34:50.214 --> 34:52.007
Did you think he had a gun?

34:52.049 --> 34:55.719
He had something
in his waistband.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.889
I believed it could be the gun
from the 911 calls.

34:58.931 --> 35:02.726
When Vasquez made that
affirmative move to his waist...

35:04.603 --> 35:06.605
(sighs)

35:08.440 --> 35:10.192
Anything else?

35:15.030 --> 35:16.990
(sighs)

35:17.032 --> 35:20.452
Officer Robson and the suspect.

35:21.954 --> 35:23.330
What?

35:24.998 --> 35:27.376
Just a feeling.

35:27.417 --> 35:29.211
I think they knew each other.

35:29.253 --> 35:31.213
Some kind of bad blood.

35:35.259 --> 35:36.844
If Borders' conviction
is vacated?

35:36.885 --> 35:39.096
A lot of egg on a lot of faces.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.765
If he didn't kill her, how'd the
pendant end up in his apartment?

35:41.807 --> 35:43.684
Uh-huh. Not necessarily.

35:43.725 --> 35:45.227
Spoken like an ex-cop.

35:45.269 --> 35:46.395
Borders dated her.

35:46.436 --> 35:47.437
Once.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.481
Yeah, he could've stole it.

35:49.523 --> 35:52.526
Could've this, could've that.

35:52.568 --> 35:54.111
Say you're right.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.738
You know, say it was cops.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.490
One particular cop.

35:58.532 --> 36:00.993
Bunch of them worked the scene.

36:01.034 --> 36:03.829
Harry Bosch found the pendant.

36:03.871 --> 36:05.622
You know his reputation.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.499
Colors outside the lines.

36:07.541 --> 36:09.209
A far cry from what
you're talking about.

36:11.044 --> 36:13.505
Roberto Flores case?

36:13.547 --> 36:15.382
He used a throw-down to make it
look like a good shoot.

36:15.424 --> 36:16.633
That's apocryphal.

36:16.675 --> 36:17.843
Jury found for the plaintiff.

36:17.885 --> 36:19.636
Gave her a dollar, you know,

36:19.678 --> 36:23.599
slap on the wrist for violating
policy, not planting evidence.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.310
I think he got away with it.

36:26.351 --> 36:28.645
And not for the first time.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.648
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Price check on Aisle 3.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.275
Price check on Aisle 3, please.

36:46.038 --> 36:48.040
(timer ticking)

36:50.959 --> 36:52.920
(clears throat)

36:52.961 --> 36:54.963
(timer rings)

37:08.185 --> 37:12.522
(sighs)
I love this fucking movie.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.358
Holy smoke.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.610
Or would you rather do this?

37:16.652 --> 37:18.612
(Barrel laughs)

37:18.654 --> 37:21.114
-Man without a Star.
-(gunshot on TV)

37:21.156 --> 37:22.491
-Kirk Douglas.
-JEFF JIMSON (on TV): Aw, Demps,

37:22.532 --> 37:23.867
-when do I learn that?
-The Chin.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.452
-DEMPSEY RAE (on TV): You don't.
-Yeah.

37:25.494 --> 37:27.287
Twirling a gun never saved
a man's life.

37:27.329 --> 37:29.665
There's only one thing
you got to learn.

37:31.458 --> 37:33.126
Get it out fast.

37:33.168 --> 37:35.379
-They broke the mold.
-And then...

37:35.420 --> 37:39.257
put it away... slow.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.260
(siren wailing in distance)

37:46.390 --> 37:48.100
How'd you find me?

37:48.141 --> 37:50.686
Saw you in the parking lot with
your girlfriend. I followed you.

37:50.727 --> 37:54.648
(scoffs)
Not my girlfriend.

37:54.690 --> 37:57.359
Okay. Just the way you two were
bitching at each other.

37:57.401 --> 37:59.236
She's just a customer.
Nothing more.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.862
Pretty swift with that needle.

38:00.904 --> 38:03.198
I was a medic in Iraq.

38:03.240 --> 38:06.034
No shit.

38:06.076 --> 38:08.286
Fifth SFG. Afghanistan.

38:11.331 --> 38:13.000
Your customer, she OD a lot?

38:14.042 --> 38:17.170
Who's counting anymore?

38:17.212 --> 38:18.964
Thank God for Narcan.

38:19.006 --> 38:21.717
That shit.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.802
What's her war story?

38:23.844 --> 38:26.013
Her service was stateside.

38:26.054 --> 38:28.932
That's not why she's fucked up.

38:28.974 --> 38:31.643
Who's Daisy?

38:31.685 --> 38:33.729
How do you know about that?

38:33.770 --> 38:36.648
I clocked the "rest in peace"
tattoo.

38:36.690 --> 38:40.068
It was her daughter.

38:40.110 --> 38:42.446
How'd she die?

38:42.487 --> 38:44.781
She got murdered.

38:47.409 --> 38:50.328
That's fucked up. Recent?

38:50.370 --> 38:52.789
About ten years ago.

38:53.874 --> 38:55.876
How old was she?

38:55.917 --> 38:57.252
She was 14.

38:58.754 --> 39:01.214
Not enough pills in the world
for that shit.

39:01.256 --> 39:03.800
No.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.595
They ever solve it?

39:06.636 --> 39:09.473
Nah.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.519
Speaking of pills.

39:14.561 --> 39:16.813
What do you need?

39:16.855 --> 39:19.024
I need to get
into the Garcia Clinic.

39:19.066 --> 39:20.442
Need you to vouch for me.

39:23.195 --> 39:24.780
I guess I owe you.

39:24.821 --> 39:27.991
I guess you do. Big time.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.118
Kept your ass from going
to fucking jail.

39:30.160 --> 39:32.746
(chuckles)

39:32.788 --> 39:34.915
How fucked up are you, Reilly?

39:34.956 --> 39:39.044
How fucked up I need to be?

39:41.713 --> 39:43.715
DWIGHT:
RHD was here.

39:43.757 --> 39:46.760
Wanted to know if Gary
was back on the street.

39:46.802 --> 39:50.514
Thought he was staying away
from all that.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.224
He was.

39:52.265 --> 39:54.309
I thought he was.

39:54.351 --> 39:56.311
Steady job.

39:56.353 --> 39:58.063
Going to church.

40:02.442 --> 40:04.736
I dropped by his place.

40:07.447 --> 40:10.492
I found this in his bedroom.

40:13.620 --> 40:15.747
I didn't know he had that.

40:15.789 --> 40:17.666
He was worried about something?

40:17.707 --> 40:21.086
If he was, he didn't tell me.

40:22.629 --> 40:25.715
He didn't say anything to me,
either.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.551
I thought you all
were out of touch.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.302
Yeah...

40:29.344 --> 40:31.680
Two South Bureau detectives
asked me to arrange a meet.

40:31.721 --> 40:33.682
What about?

40:33.723 --> 40:35.225
That church drive-by.

40:35.267 --> 40:37.727
What would Gary know about that?

40:37.769 --> 40:41.731
Oh, they... they were
just working a lead.

40:41.773 --> 40:44.067
Thought he could put them in
touch with someone who might.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.778
Did he meet with them?

40:46.820 --> 40:48.405
He did.

40:48.446 --> 40:51.366
(sighs)

40:51.408 --> 40:53.577
Somebody saw them together.

40:55.412 --> 40:58.540
Goddamn it.

40:58.582 --> 41:00.208
Goddamn it to hell.

41:11.344 --> 41:12.929
Detectives.

We have some news.

41:17.392 --> 41:19.394
We got him.

41:23.273 --> 41:25.859
Are you sure?
