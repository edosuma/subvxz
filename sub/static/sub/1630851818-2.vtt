WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:10.010 --> 00:11.886
This is what we're selling this year.

00:11.970 --> 00:16.266
Next week, we'll be on TV,
on the radio, on the press.

00:16.349 --> 00:19.394
We'll be present in all these media.

00:19.477 --> 00:23.565
And here, we have
the focus group results for the singles.

00:24.149 --> 00:28.194
Just look at their reaction
to "Cómo es Posible Que a Mi Lado."

00:29.070 --> 00:31.906
Maybe we should start
with that single instead of "Dame."

00:31.990 --> 00:33.450
They also loved "Dame."

00:33.533 --> 00:34.451
There's no rush.

00:34.534 --> 00:38.455
And we'll use a different
commercial strategy per region.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.290
More youthful for South America,

00:40.373 --> 00:43.084
and a bit more classical for Europe.

00:44.502 --> 00:45.545
I love it.

00:45.628 --> 00:48.506
When you get back from LA,
we have a press conference.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.216
Please don't forget, Micky.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.136
Yeah. Just make sure
everything's how I like it.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.262
Of course, Micky.

00:54.971 --> 00:55.930
Great work.

02:02.747 --> 02:04.833
We have a problem with the album name.

02:04.916 --> 02:07.794
- The album name is perfect.
- We just got a call.

02:07.877 --> 02:09.170
There's a lawsuit.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.090
Plagiarism.

02:28.648 --> 02:29.566
What?

02:30.066 --> 02:31.901
Please, tell me they loved it.

02:31.985 --> 02:35.947
<i>The song is amazing. If it were up to me,
it would be the first single.</i>

02:37.073 --> 02:38.783
<i>Hey, and,</i>

02:38.867 --> 02:41.286
<i>I wanna give you credit
as one of the composers.</i>

02:41.369 --> 02:45.290
What, Micky? Don't be silly,
you know I don't deserve credit.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.251
<i>All I did was watch
while you and Kiko wrote it.</i>

02:48.334 --> 02:50.420
Exactly. You were there, you get credit.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.505
<i>Fine, then. Suit yourself.</i>

02:53.423 --> 02:57.343
<i>-Thanks for counting on me.</i>
- That's what friends are for, right?

02:59.220 --> 03:01.723
What the hell
are you doing studying in Spain?

03:01.806 --> 03:06.311
Don't you want to be
in the music industry writing music?

03:06.394 --> 03:09.063
Well, I do. Though among other things.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.316
But that's pretty much the idea.

03:11.399 --> 03:13.902
Look, I just opened my office in Mexico.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.530
You can't imagine
everything we're doing, it's crazy.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.532
Come work for me in Mexico.

03:19.616 --> 03:20.658
I want you there.

03:21.868 --> 03:22.952
In Mexico, now?

03:24.370 --> 03:26.748
- Hey man, just like that?
- What do you say?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.252
<i>Let me check things out
and I'll let you know.</i>

03:31.753 --> 03:32.587
<i>Okay?</i>

03:34.005 --> 03:36.716
But, hey, man,
thanks again for relying on me.

03:36.799 --> 03:37.800
<i>Thank you.</i>

03:38.468 --> 03:39.302
Very well.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.055
- I'll call you.
<i>-Great, take care.</i>

03:42.138 --> 03:44.057
- Hugs, Micky.
<i>-Hugs to you, bye.</i>

03:57.237 --> 04:00.949
Come on, you know me.
You really think I'd plagiarize a song?

04:01.032 --> 04:03.576
I've never plagiarized a single note.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.161
Look, I don't know, Kiko.

04:05.244 --> 04:06.079
I don't know.

04:06.579 --> 04:09.707
Maybe you heard something
by this composer and don't remember.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.668
Maybe you didn't mean to.

04:12.168 --> 04:15.046
Didn't mean to?
You don't plagiarize without meaning to.

04:15.129 --> 04:18.257
I've never even heard of Conti,
I didn't know he existed.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.134
Well, it's a tricky situation.

04:20.218 --> 04:23.638
The melodies don't sound alike,
but maybe it's apples and oranges.

04:23.721 --> 04:26.641
So, I'll fly to Buenos Aires
tomorrow and clean this up.

04:27.141 --> 04:30.561
Meanwhile, Patricio,
I recommend pushing back the release.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.981
No. You don't get it.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.441
Hundreds of billboards have been printed,

04:35.525 --> 04:38.236
and on Tuesday,
we start promoting it worldwide.

04:38.319 --> 04:41.197
Damn, the album
has already been distributed, get it?

04:41.281 --> 04:44.826
Patricio, if the song sounds
like "Nada es Igual," they have a case.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.620
And if they have a case,
you can't use the song's name,

04:47.704 --> 04:49.289
which is also the album's name,

04:49.372 --> 04:51.833
in billboards or promotions,

04:51.916 --> 04:53.126
anywhere.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.169
Get it?

05:23.614 --> 05:27.577
Micky, you were supposed
to go to court weeks ago.

05:29.245 --> 05:30.997
No one told me.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.790
Weren't you served a summons?

05:33.833 --> 05:35.460
A request to go to court?

05:39.589 --> 05:41.591
How often do you check your mail, Micky?

05:42.800 --> 05:46.054
Well, it doesn't matter now.
I talked to the police.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.513
They'll leave you alone,

05:47.597 --> 05:50.808
as long as you appear in court tomorrow.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.937
That won't happen.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.190
The second he's there, everyone will know.

05:57.273 --> 05:59.901
I just promised them
you'd be there tomorrow.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.820
It's that, or next time they lock you up.

06:03.654 --> 06:04.989
Listen to me.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.784
Micky isn't stepping foot in that court.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.577
Okay, fine.

06:09.660 --> 06:12.705
We don't have to go.
But what's plan B, Miguel?

06:17.043 --> 06:18.378
I'm okay, man.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.088
What time do they open tomorrow?

06:21.172 --> 06:22.298
At 7:00.

06:32.433 --> 06:33.351
Hello?

07:05.174 --> 07:08.010
This is the launch
of your first world tour.

07:09.387 --> 07:10.721
Is everything ready?

07:11.264 --> 07:12.098
Good.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.684
Oh! I just remembered!

07:14.767 --> 07:17.687
Mauricio Ambrosi, he's a lifelong friend.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.691
He's coming to Mexico
and I'd like him to be part of the team.

07:21.774 --> 07:22.859
Doing what?

07:23.734 --> 07:26.154
I don't know, music is his thing.

07:27.029 --> 07:29.407
Maybe we can find
something interesting for him.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.033
- I'll look into it.
- Thanks.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.410
Of course, Micky.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.370
Hello. Good evening. How's everyone?

07:35.496 --> 07:38.499
Thanks, I'll answer
anything you want up there.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.418
Thank you.

07:40.501 --> 07:42.462
-<i>Please, take a seat...</i>
- It's Karla.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.047
- Have her call in half an hour.
- It's urgent.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.467
<i>...will answer all your questions.
Thank you.</i>

07:47.550 --> 07:48.384
What is it?

07:48.467 --> 07:51.721
<i>I just talked to the judge, Patricio.
The lawsuit is serious.</i>

07:51.804 --> 07:55.975
<i>Unless Conti drops the lawsuit,
we'll have to go to court.</i>

07:56.058 --> 07:58.144
<i>You, Kiko, Luis Miguel and I.</i>

07:58.728 --> 07:59.562
When?

07:59.645 --> 08:02.690
<i>In three months, four, tops.</i>

08:02.773 --> 08:04.108
<i>Good evening, how are you?</i>

08:06.152 --> 08:10.031
<i>I'd like to thank the press,
the media, for being here tonight.</i>

08:10.114 --> 08:12.909
How am I supposed
to promote it if I can't use the name?

08:12.992 --> 08:16.078
<i>I don't know, but if we do,
the fine will be through the roof.</i>

08:16.162 --> 08:17.538
I can't use it on anything?

08:17.622 --> 08:19.207
<i>No, Patricio, nothing.</i>

08:20.124 --> 08:24.378
...I hope it helps me be
less isolated and closer to my audience.

08:24.462 --> 08:29.842
I've always been close to my audience,
I mean closer to you, the media.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.678
And I hope you treat me
a little better, get to know me

08:33.304 --> 08:34.639
a bit better

08:34.722 --> 08:36.682
<i>as a person, right?</i>

08:48.236 --> 08:52.031
<i>And I'd just like to say I'm really happy</i>

08:52.114 --> 08:56.160
<i>to be with you tonight.
So, should we start with the questions?</i>

08:56.244 --> 08:59.539
Micky, I swear we just found out.

08:59.622 --> 09:02.291
Bullshit! What is Karla
doing in Buenos Aires, then?

09:02.375 --> 09:04.126
Fine, a few days ago, it's recent.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.587
Let me know
the second it happens, asshole!

09:06.671 --> 09:11.384
Why? We couldn't postpone the press event,
we couldn't postpone the album release.

09:11.467 --> 09:15.846
If you hide my own company's things
from me, this won't work.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.182
I was waiting to see if it was true.

09:18.266 --> 09:21.269
Right, it's easier to tell me
in the middle of a press event!

09:21.352 --> 09:22.228
Right?

09:24.855 --> 09:26.566
Had I known it would be like this,

09:26.649 --> 09:27.984
I would've kept McCluskey.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.200
I'll fix this.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.869
Yeah, and quickly, man!

09:48.337 --> 09:51.090
Relax, I recommend you be honest.

09:51.173 --> 09:53.551
Answer all the judge's questions.

09:53.634 --> 09:56.137
Remember, you have nothing to hide.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.099
Wanna bet it was Brockhaus?

10:02.184 --> 10:04.353
What does Brockhaus have to do with this?

10:05.479 --> 10:08.649
I don't know, he was mad when I fired him,

10:08.733 --> 10:10.443
and I never saw him again.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.653
I don't know who was worse, him or Daniel.

10:17.908 --> 10:21.662
I sent another car
to the front to confuse the press.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.039
The press?

10:23.831 --> 10:24.749
There'll be press?

10:24.832 --> 10:26.959
No, just in case some reporter found out.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.211
Don't worry, there won't be any press.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.254
What do you want?

11:12.338 --> 11:14.590
<i>We're standing by,
in case you want changes.</i>

11:14.674 --> 11:15.508
No.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.593
Fine.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.887
<i>Good. Micky, I'm so glad.</i>

11:20.471 --> 11:22.473
<i>-No changes, then?</i>
- I said no!

11:22.556 --> 11:24.308
<i>-Okay.</i>
- Hey.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.351
<i>Yeah?</i>

11:25.434 --> 11:26.977
How's it going with Ambrosi?

11:27.061 --> 11:30.022
<i>Good, he just arrived at the office,
he's happy.</i>

11:30.523 --> 11:32.358
<i>-Why?</i>
- Take good care of him.

11:32.441 --> 11:33.734
<i>Yeah, no need to worry.</i>

12:03.431 --> 12:06.058
Did you see all the billboards
we had to take down?

12:06.934 --> 12:07.893
This morning.

12:08.602 --> 12:09.728
Did you talk to Karla?

12:10.438 --> 12:11.814
Is she with that Conti guy?

12:11.897 --> 12:14.191
She just called. I'll call her back.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.526
You'll tell me later.

12:15.609 --> 12:17.153
I have to figure this out.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.655
Micky wants me to give his friend a job.

12:19.738 --> 12:20.990
A job? Now?

12:27.580 --> 12:29.540
Listen, this could be huge.

12:29.623 --> 12:31.709
I agree, it's a great single.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.254
Micky told me you'll be working with us.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.756
So it seems.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.592
He didn't tell me much,
he said I should talk to you.

12:39.675 --> 12:40.843
Don't worry.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.929
We have the perfect position
and we need someone to help out.

12:44.430 --> 12:48.559
José Pérez here
will tell you exactly what it entails.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.269
- Mauricio, hi.
- How are you?

12:50.352 --> 12:52.396
- José Pérez, it's a pleasure.
- Likewise.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.942
- Come with me.
- With you?

12:57.026 --> 12:57.860
- Yes.
- Yeah.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.487
Patricio, thanks.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.490
- Thank you so much.
- Make yourself at home.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.912
The office is incredible.

13:07.995 --> 13:08.829
Incredible.

13:09.997 --> 13:10.831
Well,

13:11.874 --> 13:12.708
here we are.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.293
Come on in.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.046
Mauricio, right?

13:17.755 --> 13:18.881
Yes, Mauricio Ambrosi.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.132
Mauricio Ambrosi.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.219
What's all this?

13:23.302 --> 13:25.262
This is Luis Miguel's sanctuary.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.974
These are all his fan club letters.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.726
So, what do I have to do?

13:31.227 --> 13:32.061
Read them?

13:32.853 --> 13:35.523
Of course, read them and answer them.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.817
- All of these?
- No.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.778
There are a bunch more in storage.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.405
So, be patient.

14:43.382 --> 14:47.761
They sent all the accounting info
to Polanco, ask them to send it back.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.555
I need the invoices on my desk.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.432
It's important, please.

14:53.642 --> 14:54.602
What did Karla say?

14:54.685 --> 14:56.854
That the writer that's suing us,

14:56.937 --> 14:59.356
this Conti guy,
doesn't want to talk to us.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.692
She should give him a blank check.

15:01.775 --> 15:04.612
Whatever it takes to drop
the claim and injunction today.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.948
He said he wants us
to talk to his manager only.

15:08.032 --> 15:08.908
Perfect.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.453
- I'm sure he's a deadbeat.
- It's Alex McCluskey, Pato.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.539
Conti is represented by Publishow.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.554
Yes, he's right here.
I'll put you through.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.686
We'll fix this in a jiff.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.274
Alex, how are you?

17:48.275 --> 17:49.276
Great.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.529
Exactly, that's why I'm calling.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.073
We talked to your songwriter, this--

17:55.157 --> 17:56.658
- Mariano Conti.
- Mariano Conti.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.703
He said we should talk to you
about "Nada Es Igual."

18:01.705 --> 18:02.539
Alex,

18:03.707 --> 18:06.168
our legal department checked it out.

18:06.752 --> 18:10.089
The lawsuit won't go through,
the songs don't sound anything alike.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.383
You know Kiko would never plagiarize.

18:16.720 --> 18:17.679
Perfect.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.891
So, stop giving me
the runaround and give me a number.

18:22.142 --> 18:25.395
I won't call again,
it's now or never. How much?

18:28.398 --> 18:30.234
Look, I know you're still mad

18:30.317 --> 18:33.028
because I took your only client,
but this is too much.

18:35.739 --> 18:37.825
Yeah, we fixed this in a jiff.

19:57.779 --> 20:00.240
Micky, we checked
your finances with the accountants.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.075
Here's everything you need to look at.

20:03.660 --> 20:06.246
I think you should sit down for this.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.832
How much will this lawsuit cost me?

20:08.916 --> 20:09.875
It's...

20:12.461 --> 20:13.462
plenty.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.969
Enough to drive you to bankruptcy.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.821
Is this what I have to pay?

20:41.031 --> 20:43.116
- Really?
- Look, we have a plan.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.327
But... it won't be easy.

20:45.994 --> 20:48.956
If we follow the plan,
you'll be out of debt in--

20:49.748 --> 20:50.707
- Twelve months.
- Yes.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.961
Including child support,
the debt with the singer,

20:54.044 --> 20:55.170
the Brockhaus debt.

20:55.712 --> 20:56.630
Okay, then.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.008
Transfer money from the bank.

21:00.550 --> 21:01.927
Fix it. What's the problem?

21:04.096 --> 21:06.974
Micky, I don't think
you've looked at your account lately<i>.</i>

21:07.849 --> 21:09.226
It won't be enough.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.937
With this plan,

21:12.604 --> 21:14.648
you'll have to do some concerts

21:15.774 --> 21:17.067
and sell some properties.

21:17.734 --> 21:20.529
You want me to sell Acapulco?
Is that why you came?

21:20.612 --> 21:21.863
Not just Acapulco, Micky,

21:21.947 --> 21:24.700
the house in Mexico City,
your cars, the yacht.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.702
Actually, we have a buyer,

21:27.369 --> 21:30.247
we just need your approval to proceed.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.625
- What do you say?
- I need to think about it.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.211
No, you don't get it. There's no time to--

21:39.506 --> 21:40.632
Let me think.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.087
Luismi, can I take a picture?

23:52.431 --> 23:55.100
<i>Did you talk to McCluskey
about the lawsuit or not?</i>

23:55.183 --> 23:58.103
<i>Yes, Micky, I talked to him
and tried to convince him.</i>

23:58.186 --> 24:01.398
<i>But he won't listen.
I'm not his favorite person.</i>

24:01.481 --> 24:02.315
Fuck!

24:03.859 --> 24:06.069
So, what are our options, Patricio?

24:06.903 --> 24:10.907
<i>We can wait until this
is decided in the courts of Argentina.</i>

24:11.575 --> 24:15.162
Wait a whole year to be able
to use the album name?

24:15.245 --> 24:16.621
<i>It won't take that long.</i>

24:16.705 --> 24:17.581
Are you stupid?

24:18.290 --> 24:21.376
I won't let the sales plummet
because of your stupidity.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.962
You know what?
I'll go to Mexico and fix it.

24:24.045 --> 24:26.214
<i>Micky, there's no need for you to come.</i>

24:26.298 --> 24:28.758
You obviously can't solve it.

24:29.384 --> 24:30.218
Or can you?

24:33.638 --> 24:34.473
Idiot.

24:57.579 --> 24:58.663
Man!

24:58.747 --> 24:59.915
What's up, man?

25:00.665 --> 25:01.500
Have a seat.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.087
Here, have a drink.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.339
Not now, thanks.

25:07.422 --> 25:08.924
- What do you mean?
- Really.

25:09.883 --> 25:13.261
Let me tell you, I talked
to the construction firm in Acapulco.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.304
They want to build

25:15.597 --> 25:16.890
an apartment complex.

25:20.143 --> 25:20.977
Really?

25:22.938 --> 25:25.106
They'll just demolish the house?

25:26.441 --> 25:27.817
So it would seem, Micky.

25:34.282 --> 25:35.533
When exactly...

25:38.954 --> 25:40.205
did I turn into this?

25:43.542 --> 25:45.377
When I think of Acapulco, I think

25:46.253 --> 25:49.256
about when we finished
shooting the "La Incondicional" video.

25:51.007 --> 25:52.425
- Remember?
- Yeah.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.220
When we'd go to the Baby.

25:56.846 --> 26:00.058
You'd wake Doc up at 2:00 a.m.
to go to the Baby.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.018
Yeah, I remember.

26:02.811 --> 26:03.645
Poor guy.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.155
I don't want to sell that house.

26:14.864 --> 26:15.907
I know...

26:19.411 --> 26:21.454
but I guess we have no choice.

27:37.864 --> 27:39.824
LUIS MIGUEL ROMANCES

28:19.155 --> 28:20.115
He's here.

28:22.701 --> 28:23.868
Come in, Alex.

28:23.952 --> 28:24.786
Thanks.

28:28.415 --> 28:29.958
Can you leave us, Patricio?

28:30.041 --> 28:33.044
- You're kicking me out of my own office?
- Get out, Patricio.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.297
Micky--

28:37.090 --> 28:37.924
Out.

28:44.556 --> 28:45.557
Have a seat, Alex.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.269
I'm fine like this, Micky. Thank you.

28:52.355 --> 28:53.356
What do you want?

28:53.857 --> 28:55.233
It's simple, Micky.

28:56.943 --> 28:58.611
When you left Publishow,

28:59.195 --> 29:01.239
you canceled at least 20 concert dates.

29:01.322 --> 29:03.700
You left me hanging
without a certain income.

29:03.783 --> 29:05.535
I want that money.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.080
I thought I wasn't Publishow.

29:09.164 --> 29:10.540
That's the point, Micky.

29:12.167 --> 29:16.629
Publishow wanted to represent
other artists so this wouldn't happen.

29:16.713 --> 29:19.799
We were your manager for seven years.

29:19.883 --> 29:22.010
- We deserve that cash.
-"We"?

29:22.093 --> 29:24.679
- Who do you mean?
- Publishow wasn't only my company.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.639
Don't you dare bring Hugo into this.

29:29.726 --> 29:33.313
If Hugo had seen you working
with Patricio in this office,

29:33.897 --> 29:35.273
he'd have been heartbroken.

29:38.401 --> 29:41.988
And what would he think
about you blackmailing me?

29:46.242 --> 29:48.578
I'll put my Mexico City
apartment in your name,

29:48.661 --> 29:51.414
and write you a check
for $500,000 to your songwriter.

29:52.415 --> 29:54.167
But let me be very clear,

29:54.250 --> 29:57.420
you know full well
that Kiko wrote that song.

29:57.504 --> 29:58.838
So, after this,

30:00.173 --> 30:02.550
I don't ever want
to fucking see you again.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.094
You no longer exist.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.771
Don't forget
I really cared about you, Micky.

30:20.527 --> 30:21.402
Good luck.

30:29.536 --> 30:30.495
Can you believe it?

30:33.206 --> 30:34.541
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

30:35.583 --> 30:37.836
What matters is <i>I</i> fixed it.

30:38.419 --> 30:40.421
He wouldn't see me. What could I do?

30:42.048 --> 30:43.049
What could you do?

30:45.552 --> 30:46.594
Your job.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.638
I shouldn't be doing this.

30:52.433 --> 30:53.268
Mau,

30:54.727 --> 30:55.645
let's go.

30:59.357 --> 31:00.316
Is everything okay?

31:04.904 --> 31:05.947
You know what?

31:06.739 --> 31:08.199
Let's go have a drink.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.201
- Sounds perfect.
- Yeah?

31:10.785 --> 31:11.870
- Yes.
- Let's go.

31:12.996 --> 31:14.038
You're kidding.

31:15.748 --> 31:17.667
You're dating Mariah Carey?

31:20.086 --> 31:22.672
We're just hanging out,
getting to know each other.

31:24.048 --> 31:25.049
You lucky bastard!

31:26.092 --> 31:27.677
It's just not fair.

31:27.760 --> 31:28.678
I've been single--

31:30.054 --> 31:32.890
I've been single since we met
in Seville the last time.

31:32.974 --> 31:33.808
No fucking way!

31:34.309 --> 31:36.561
- You haven't been single four years.
- I swear.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.479
But it's because I'm picky.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.440
Yeah, right!

31:40.523 --> 31:43.067
You're picky or you don't have the balls?

31:44.277 --> 31:48.114
I have the balls,
I came running the second you called.

31:48.197 --> 31:49.240
Cheers to that.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.326
- And to Mariah Carey.
- Right!

31:51.409 --> 31:52.368
Damn.

31:54.078 --> 31:55.079
Why did you hire me?

31:55.997 --> 31:58.249
Don't get me wrong,

31:58.333 --> 32:02.170
I just don't want you to feel
you have to hire me because we're friends.

32:04.047 --> 32:06.299
You think I'm doing you a favor?

32:06.382 --> 32:08.384
No, but look where Patricio put me.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.762
- The fans are important.
- Really important.

32:10.845 --> 32:14.599
Yes, but I kind of feel
Robles doesn't need me on his team.

32:14.682 --> 32:15.516
Look.

32:17.435 --> 32:20.688
Working with my fans may be
the most important part of my career.

32:21.439 --> 32:24.525
But be patient,
you won't work there forever, okay?

32:25.026 --> 32:25.985
I have other plans.

32:27.487 --> 32:28.321
Why me?

32:30.573 --> 32:31.449
I don't know.

32:32.659 --> 32:33.826
I'm sick of--

32:35.787 --> 32:38.081
Out of all the people you know, why me?

32:39.582 --> 32:40.917
I don't know who to trust.

32:46.881 --> 32:47.966
Can I trust you?

32:50.635 --> 32:51.594
Always, Micky.

32:53.012 --> 32:53.846
Always.

32:54.681 --> 32:56.557
We've known each other all our lives.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.359
<i>Please give me good news.</i>

33:07.568 --> 33:08.486
It's done.

33:09.445 --> 33:12.073
Next month, we can use the album name.

33:13.616 --> 33:15.535
We'll miss the entire premiere month.

33:15.618 --> 33:16.911
It's fine,

33:16.995 --> 33:18.496
we can renegotiate the spots

33:18.579 --> 33:20.957
and see what to do
with all the billboards.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.834
Have the projections changed?

33:22.917 --> 33:24.127
It'll sell well,

33:25.044 --> 33:27.130
but not better than <i>Segundo Romance.</i>

33:27.213 --> 33:30.091
Though we will recover
what we've invested in promotion.

33:30.174 --> 33:31.926
What we need now is Luis Miguel.

33:32.593 --> 33:35.179
We have to put
that money back in his account.

33:54.907 --> 33:55.825
Hi, Micky.

33:56.784 --> 33:58.369
Should we come back later?

34:01.873 --> 34:02.707
How are you?

34:03.291 --> 34:05.084
Let's have a quick meeting.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.880
I've been thinking about what you told me.

34:12.717 --> 34:13.634
Sell it all.

34:16.471 --> 34:17.305
Okay.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.391
Do you want to go over the list so--?

34:20.475 --> 34:23.186
No. Sell Acapulco,

34:23.686 --> 34:24.896
the yacht--

34:26.564 --> 34:28.316
Well... everything.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.819
Even if you sell it all,
it won't be enough.

34:31.903 --> 34:34.113
- You'll have to do some <i>palenques--</i>
- Garduño.

34:37.033 --> 34:37.867
Not now.

34:43.039 --> 34:44.290
Sell the properties.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.251
Whatever you say, Micky.

34:47.794 --> 34:49.545
I'll start preparing everything.

35:01.849 --> 35:02.934
Hello.

42:00.518 --> 42:05.564
