00:01.956 --> 00:03.698
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:03.769 --> 00:06.447
My father thinks the reason
I can't make a relationship work

00:06.495 --> 00:07.846
is because I'm spoiled.

00:07.900 --> 00:09.900
All right, how much,
exactly, does he pay for?

00:12.050 --> 00:13.385
Okay, I'll tell you,

00:13.433 --> 00:15.065
but please don't judge me.

00:15.206 --> 00:18.885
He pays for my car,
my rent, and my credit cards.

00:21.675 --> 00:23.990
I'm trying, but I'm judging.

00:26.167 --> 00:27.330
Maybe your dad's right.

00:27.378 --> 00:29.472
Yeah, women do like a man
that can support himself.

00:29.520 --> 00:32.019
I have come to
an important decision.

00:32.073 --> 00:34.175
I will not be accepting
your money anymore.

00:34.230 --> 00:35.464
That's wonderful.

00:35.534 --> 00:37.580
Yes, that is wonderful.
You will no longer be able

00:37.628 --> 00:39.301
to accuse me of being spoiled.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.012
I'm so proud of you.

00:41.076 --> 00:42.793
Dad, I'm trying to tell you off,
and you're ruining it

00:42.840 --> 00:45.813
with your delight and relief.

00:48.668 --> 00:50.324
Uh-huh.

00:53.246 --> 00:54.854
Interesting.

00:57.496 --> 00:58.590
Okay.

00:58.660 --> 00:59.668
How bad is it?

00:59.716 --> 01:00.761
Let me put it this way...

01:00.809 --> 01:04.435
do you own a barrel
and suspenders?

01:05.605 --> 01:06.823
Are you serious?

01:06.871 --> 01:09.936
I'm not wearing this visor
to play women's golf.

01:11.330 --> 01:12.409
Hi.
LEONARD: Hey.

01:12.559 --> 01:13.909
Oh, let me guess.

01:13.957 --> 01:16.543
You guys are drafting
your fantasy accounting firms.

01:18.147 --> 01:20.244
We're helping Raj
figure out his finances.

01:20.291 --> 01:22.337
Well, he has a job.
How bad can it be?

01:22.383 --> 01:25.095
Well, his rent and car lease
are exceedingly high.

01:25.143 --> 01:26.188
You couple that
with his penchant

01:26.235 --> 01:27.690
for dining out and shopping...

01:27.738 --> 01:29.602
Wait, wait, not shopping
for clothes, right?

01:29.650 --> 01:30.973
Because look.

01:33.173 --> 01:35.548
He also has a remarkable
amount of credit card debt.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.587
I thought your dad paid your cards.

01:37.660 --> 01:40.399
I have a card for emergencies
that I pay for myself.

01:40.524 --> 01:42.774
What emergency happened
at the L.A. Zoo?

01:42.822 --> 01:45.214
That's a penguin I sponsor.

01:46.351 --> 01:47.945
They're losing their homes
to global warming,

01:47.992 --> 01:49.757
and my car gets, like,
seven miles a gallon,

01:49.805 --> 01:51.702
so I felt bad.

01:52.211 --> 01:54.031
What is Pink Cheeks?

01:54.079 --> 01:56.979
It's intimate waxing.
Quit looking at that!

01:58.782 --> 02:00.095
Maybe you should find someone

02:00.143 --> 02:02.499
to help you get your
finances under control.

02:02.595 --> 02:03.665
Like a business manager?

02:03.713 --> 02:05.265
No, absolutely not.

02:05.313 --> 02:06.688
You can't afford to hire someone

02:06.736 --> 02:08.287
who'll forbid you
from spending your money

02:08.334 --> 02:09.437
on foolish expenses.

02:09.485 --> 02:12.579
That is a foolish expense,
and I forbid it.

02:14.274 --> 02:17.367
What if there's someone
who just likes controlling

02:17.415 --> 02:20.330
other people and stealing
joy from their lives?

02:21.298 --> 02:23.639
He sounds like a sociopath.

02:24.259 --> 02:27.109
We don't know,
his mother never had him tested.

02:30.040 --> 02:32.727
You're talking about me.
Very funny.

02:33.118 --> 02:36.941
Although I would enjoy
drawing up a budget

02:37.031 --> 02:38.812
and forcing Raj to adhere to it

02:38.860 --> 02:40.212
without an ounce of compassion.

02:40.260 --> 02:43.618
Wait, wait, who's gonna
break it to the penguin?

02:45.001 --> 02:46.337
Okay, Sheldon.

02:46.462 --> 02:48.227
Yeah, I'm putting you
in charge of my finances.

02:48.274 --> 02:50.897
I will not spend another penny
that you don't authorize.

02:50.993 --> 02:52.055
Very well.

02:52.126 --> 02:54.562
Hey, Comic-Con tickets
go on sale this Friday.

02:54.610 --> 02:56.251
You can't buy one.

02:58.391 --> 03:01.391

time, Pink Cheeks.

03:31.727 --> 03:33.657
You're actually going to Comic-Con?

03:33.744 --> 03:35.927
Well, Leonard wants me to do
more stuff like that with him,

03:35.974 --> 03:37.790
so I thought maybe
this year I'd tag along.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.865
Well, that's sweet.
I bet you'll have fun.

03:40.061 --> 03:41.251
So, do you want to come?

03:41.329 --> 03:42.407
No, thanks.

03:42.455 --> 03:45.912
I already live in a place
all the nerds come to.

03:46.595 --> 03:49.749
Please? I went to your
boring thing last month.

03:50.329 --> 03:52.618
My aunt's funeral?

03:53.665 --> 03:55.149
Come on, even you
checked your e-mail

03:55.197 --> 03:56.798
during the eulogy.

03:57.673 --> 03:59.571
Well, I'm not going,

03:59.657 --> 04:01.243
but I do think it's nice
you want to.

04:01.313 --> 04:02.806
It's not that I want to go,

04:02.854 --> 04:04.485
I just think
it'll make Leonard happy.

04:04.579 --> 04:05.605
And if I have to watch him

04:05.652 --> 04:08.608
squeeze into an Ewok
costume, so be it.

04:09.203 --> 04:10.899
Look at you,
going to Comic-Con,

04:10.947 --> 04:12.149
talking about Ewoks.

04:12.208 --> 04:14.800
I really have become
the cool one around here.

04:17.673 --> 04:20.180
You actually think Penny
will have fun at Comic-Con?

04:20.243 --> 04:22.548
No. Which will
make me miserable,

04:22.641 --> 04:24.946
which is usually Sheldon's job.

04:26.888 --> 04:29.048
She's gonna hate waiting
in line for the panels.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.689
She's gonna hate all
the crowds at the panels.

04:30.736 --> 04:33.383
She's gonna hate the panels.

04:33.711 --> 04:37.001
She's gonna hate how often
we say the word "panels."

04:37.507 --> 04:38.930
Why don't you just
tell her not to come?

04:38.977 --> 04:41.352
Well, she's so excited,
I can't do that to her.

04:41.429 --> 04:43.164
What if you make it sound so bad

04:43.229 --> 04:44.610
she won't want to go?

04:45.157 --> 04:47.415
That I would do to her.

04:48.751 --> 04:50.189
I can't believe Penny's
gonna get to go,

04:50.236 --> 04:51.236
and I'm not.

04:51.340 --> 04:53.309
You can always watch
the panels online.

04:53.357 --> 04:55.916
Oh, boy, we do say that a lot.

04:56.802 --> 04:58.401
STUART:
Panels.

05:02.399 --> 05:04.451
Just wanted to be included.

05:06.718 --> 05:08.463
Come on, Sheldon, it's Comic-Con.

05:08.511 --> 05:09.806
Just let me have the money for this,

05:09.853 --> 05:11.234
and I won't ask for anything else.

05:11.282 --> 05:13.296
You put me in charge
of your finances.

05:13.344 --> 05:14.915
If you wanted someone
weak and spineless

05:14.963 --> 05:17.516
you could walk all over,
you should have asked Leonard.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.524
See? Miserable.

05:20.868 --> 05:23.610
Okay, you're right,
I got myself into this,

05:23.689 --> 05:25.622
but I've never missed
a Comic-Con with you guys.

05:25.684 --> 05:27.822
Your father may have
spoiled you, but I won't.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.306
If you want a ticket
to Comic-Con,

05:29.354 --> 05:31.590
I suggest you figure out a way
to earn the money yourself.

05:31.637 --> 05:34.627
Yeah, you're a grown man
who's highly educated.

05:34.726 --> 05:38.080
You could charge people
money to punch you.

05:39.947 --> 05:41.868
Go ahead, make jokes.
I don't know why you think

05:41.916 --> 05:44.142
you're going to Comic-Con...
you just had a baby.

05:44.252 --> 05:45.627
- So?
- Well, so?

05:45.675 --> 05:47.705
So you think Bernadette's
just gonna let you jet

05:47.753 --> 05:49.416
down to San Diego for five days

05:49.464 --> 05:50.785
and leave her alone?

05:50.833 --> 05:51.946
Hang-hang on.

05:51.994 --> 05:54.580
So I have to bring Penny,
you can't afford it,

05:54.628 --> 05:55.659
Howard's gonna get in trouble,

05:55.706 --> 05:58.517
and this guy gets
to have a great time.

05:59.394 --> 06:01.261
I'm gonna go as Dumbledore.

06:05.267 --> 06:06.400
Mm...

06:06.448 --> 06:07.720
how's my favorite girl?

06:07.768 --> 06:08.829
Okay.

06:08.876 --> 06:11.228
- What you doing?
- Making lasagna.

06:11.291 --> 06:14.105
Oh, she's sexy, she can cook.

06:14.218 --> 06:15.915
I'm such a lucky guy.
(chuckles)

06:16.080 --> 06:19.416
You want something stupid,
or you <i>did</i> something stupid?

06:20.380 --> 06:23.512
No. I just walked in here,
saw how beautiful you are

06:23.560 --> 06:25.111
and had to tell you.

06:25.182 --> 06:27.822
Oh, dear God, you're
cheating on me with Raj.

06:28.369 --> 06:31.964
(giggles):
Never gets old.

06:34.431 --> 06:36.096
Okay, there is something I want,

06:36.144 --> 06:37.973
but it's not a big deal.

06:38.113 --> 06:39.252
What is it?

06:39.300 --> 06:41.070
Well, Comic-Con tickets
go on sale this Friday,

06:41.117 --> 06:42.468
and I was hoping
I could go with the guys.

06:42.515 --> 06:44.549
But before you say anything,
I'll make up for being gone

06:44.596 --> 06:47.230
by doing everything around
here... I mean everything.

06:47.296 --> 06:48.519
I'm even gonna answer for you.

06:48.567 --> 06:50.855
(high-pitched voice):
Yes, Howard, you can go.

06:51.988 --> 06:54.140
It's so hard to say no to you.

06:54.218 --> 06:56.197
Thank you.

06:56.735 --> 06:58.656
So I'll say maybe.

06:59.672 --> 07:01.344
What? Why?

07:01.406 --> 07:03.906
You said tickets don't go
on sale till Friday, right?

07:03.961 --> 07:04.985
Yeah.

07:05.032 --> 07:08.078
You said you were gonna do
all this stuff for me, right?

07:08.641 --> 07:10.179
Yeah.

07:12.405 --> 07:14.156
See where I'm going with this?

07:16.765 --> 07:18.359
Yeah.

07:20.428 --> 07:23.617
If you don't know how
to make lasagna, Google does.

07:26.820 --> 07:30.367
Okay, so this is the
main Comic-Con floor.

07:30.415 --> 07:32.846
It's where all the
vendors and exhibits are.

07:32.915 --> 07:35.570
Wow, that is a lot
of people jammed in there.

07:35.702 --> 07:38.648
I know. Sometimes Howard
wears a striped shirt

07:38.706 --> 07:41.598
so we can play
"Where's Wolowitz?"

07:44.273 --> 07:46.994
Okay, now, Th-this is us
camping out in line

07:47.041 --> 07:48.375
for the Avengers panel.

07:48.423 --> 07:50.515
Oh, you really sleep
on the sidewalk, huh?

07:50.586 --> 07:51.633
Yeah.

07:51.719 --> 07:54.829
It can get chilly,
but Raj figured out

07:54.877 --> 07:56.135
that if you pee in a bottle

07:56.183 --> 07:57.313
and put it in your sleeping bag,

07:57.360 --> 07:59.375
it helps keep you warm.

08:01.351 --> 08:03.484
Here's the hotel room
we all share.

08:03.532 --> 08:05.758
Well, you and I would
get our own room, right?

08:05.840 --> 08:07.647
Every hotel is booked.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.549
But, yeah, see this space here

08:09.597 --> 08:11.164
between Sheldon's
feet and my head?

08:11.212 --> 08:13.023
That's where you go.

08:13.890 --> 08:15.523
Well, it's no different
than when Sheldon

08:15.571 --> 08:18.789
used to climb in bed with us
during a thunderstorm.

08:19.659 --> 08:22.023
Don't worry, we won't be
doing much sleeping anyway.

08:22.071 --> 08:23.383
It's like an all-night party.

08:23.431 --> 08:27.265
There's trivia contests
and Dungeons & Dragons.

08:27.383 --> 08:30.984
As we like to say, it's
"off the chain mail."

08:32.318 --> 08:34.320
I even said
"off the chain mail,"

08:34.368 --> 08:36.219
and she still wants to go.

08:37.389 --> 08:38.991
That's probably my fault.

08:39.057 --> 08:42.091
She may have heard about
my cool Dumbledore costume.

08:43.562 --> 08:45.844
Okay, I can give you
20 bucks for the whole box.

08:46.390 --> 08:48.523
But you charged me
hundreds for this stuff.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.601
I know. And I did it
with a straight face.

08:53.156 --> 08:55.116
But I need to earn enough money

08:55.164 --> 08:56.922
so I can go to Comic-Con.

08:57.390 --> 09:00.492
Well... all right.

09:00.609 --> 09:02.390
I'll give you 25 bucks.

09:02.454 --> 09:04.039
That's my best offer.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.040
I have no choice.

09:06.156 --> 09:07.579
You know, if you want
to make extra money,

09:07.626 --> 09:09.265
I-I could throw
some work your way.

09:09.344 --> 09:10.453
Really? I'll do anything.

09:10.493 --> 09:11.505
Great, you're hired.

09:11.553 --> 09:13.570
First thing you can do is
put price tags on these.

09:13.664 --> 09:16.039
Start the little ones at $50.

09:19.186 --> 09:20.270
You know, it's no big deal.

09:20.318 --> 09:22.469
I can put up with
anything for three days.

09:22.517 --> 09:23.570
Comic-Con's five days.

09:23.618 --> 09:25.709
Are you kidding me?

09:27.705 --> 09:29.413
Why don't you just tell him
you don't want to go?

09:29.460 --> 09:31.390
I can't, it'll break his heart.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.656
You know, he's always
making an effort

09:32.703 --> 09:34.570
to do things with me
he doesn't enjoy,

09:34.618 --> 09:37.331
like going outside.

09:37.551 --> 09:39.640
He is an indoor cat.

09:40.390 --> 09:42.042
You know, maybe it
won't be that bad.

09:42.089 --> 09:43.986
Leonard says it's
really mainstream now.

09:44.109 --> 09:46.758
Comic books aren't
just for sad nerds anymore.

10:02.336 --> 10:05.544
I mean, it is still a key
part of their demographic.

10:15.077 --> 10:16.332
(doorbell rings)

10:16.493 --> 10:18.290
BERNADETTE:
Howie, can you get that?

10:18.385 --> 10:20.204
WOLOWITZ:
Kind of busy.

10:20.383 --> 10:22.017
BERNADETTE:
Busy like I'll be with the baby

10:22.064 --> 10:23.805
if you go to San Diego?

10:24.321 --> 10:25.876
(footfalls running)

10:26.322 --> 10:27.657
Hey.

10:29.805 --> 10:30.888
What's with the gloves?

10:30.936 --> 10:33.791
They complete my ensemble.
What do you want?

10:35.070 --> 10:36.422
I'm looking to make extra money

10:36.470 --> 10:38.845
and was wondering if you had
any chores I could do.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.345
Hang on.

10:40.470 --> 10:45.485
Bernie, can I outsource my
chores to an Indian guy?

10:47.423 --> 10:48.970
BERNADETTE:
No.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.954
I tried.

10:54.083 --> 10:55.196
Hey, I was thinking,

10:55.244 --> 10:57.199
if you want to do
a couples costume,

10:57.247 --> 11:00.145
we could paint ourselves green
and be Hulk and She-Hulk.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.118
Or we could paint ourselves blue

11:02.203 --> 11:05.017
and go as Nightcrawler
and Mystique.

11:06.149 --> 11:08.959
Is there any scenario where
we're not in full body paint?

11:09.165 --> 11:12.305
Yeah, if you want us
to look like losers.

11:13.438 --> 11:15.883
Hey, um, are you sure the guys
are okay with me coming?

11:15.976 --> 11:17.571
Yeah, of course, why?

11:17.706 --> 11:19.802
This is just something
you usually do together,

11:19.850 --> 11:22.188
and if I'm screwing it up,
I don't have to go.

11:22.649 --> 11:26.301
Oh, why? Do you not want to go?

11:27.266 --> 11:29.884
Why? Do you not want me to go?

11:30.985 --> 11:33.157
(weakly):
No, I want you to go.

11:34.805 --> 11:38.618
Okay, good, 'cause that's
what I want, too.

11:42.813 --> 11:46.579
Now we're going
as Hulk and She-Hulk.

11:47.837 --> 11:50.298
I don't want to take
my shirt off at Comic-Con.

11:50.484 --> 11:53.798
If I may speak for Comic-Con,
we don't want that either.

11:55.133 --> 11:56.415
Is that nice?

11:56.495 --> 11:58.906
No, but it's honest,
and it sounds like you could use

11:58.954 --> 12:00.680
a little more honesty
in your relationship.

12:00.728 --> 12:03.251
Uh, I-it's more
complicated than that.

12:03.384 --> 12:04.915
I'm always honest with Amy.

12:04.963 --> 12:06.972
The other day she said
she was self-conscious

12:07.020 --> 12:08.751
about the beauty mark
on her shoulder,

12:08.799 --> 12:09.837
and I said, "You know,

12:09.885 --> 12:11.486
"you can call that
a beauty mark all you want.

12:11.533 --> 12:13.907
When there's hair growing
out of it, that's a mole."

12:16.290 --> 12:18.305
Do you think
she's as honest with you?

12:18.407 --> 12:19.626
I should hope so.

12:19.682 --> 12:21.415
When she called me
an insensitive jerk,

12:21.463 --> 12:23.774
I'd like to think she meant it.

12:26.683 --> 12:29.321
There's got to be other ways
you can make a quick buck.

12:29.370 --> 12:30.657
Yeah, you'd think.

12:30.829 --> 12:34.141
Ooh, maybe I could sell
my blood and sperm.

12:37.056 --> 12:38.619
I really should wear
a bell around my neck

12:38.666 --> 12:40.621
so you guys can hear me coming.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.485
Here, let me help you.

12:42.533 --> 12:43.696
Thank you.

12:43.744 --> 12:45.298
Oh, Double Stuf Oreos,

12:45.399 --> 12:47.774
I remember when
I could afford you.

12:48.462 --> 12:49.970
(Halley crying) There she goes.

12:50.018 --> 12:51.759
Stay, I'll get her.

12:51.918 --> 12:53.381
- Appreciate it.
- That's fine.

12:53.436 --> 12:55.751
She and I can cry together.

12:56.829 --> 12:58.360
He's such a sweetie.

12:58.540 --> 13:01.766
I know, I wish there was
some way we could help him.

13:01.977 --> 13:03.392
If he could find a
girl with a good job,

13:03.439 --> 13:04.868
all his problems would be over.

13:04.916 --> 13:07.508
Yeah, that's working out
great for me.

13:11.353 --> 13:13.196
Penny says they're ready to go.

13:13.540 --> 13:14.688
Very well.

13:14.823 --> 13:17.704
Prepare for a long night
of deceit.

13:18.227 --> 13:22.782
Sheldon, women can wear makeup,
it's not lying.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.423
I was talking about Leonard.

13:25.516 --> 13:27.070
And if makeup is so truthful,

13:27.118 --> 13:28.955
why is it called "concealer"?

13:30.604 --> 13:32.692
Wait, wait, wait,
what's Leonard lying about?

13:32.779 --> 13:34.665
He doesn't really want Penny
to go to Comic-Con.

13:34.722 --> 13:36.735
He's just doing it
to make her happy.

13:36.993 --> 13:38.290
Really?

13:38.352 --> 13:40.071
Because she doesn't
actually want to go.

13:40.119 --> 13:42.438
She's just doing it
to make him happy.

13:42.626 --> 13:44.587
So they're both trying
to make each other happy,

13:44.635 --> 13:48.399
and the end result
is they make each other sad?

13:48.594 --> 13:50.524
That's hilarious.

13:52.345 --> 13:54.298
I can't wait to tell them.

13:54.712 --> 13:56.328
No, you're not gonna
tell them anything.

13:56.376 --> 13:57.876
You're gonna stay out of it.

13:58.045 --> 14:00.446
- Why?
- Because it's between them.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.618
Well, if you haven't noticed,

14:01.665 --> 14:04.797
I've been between them
for the last ten years.

14:07.274 --> 14:08.329
- Hey. - Hello.
- Hi.

14:08.399 --> 14:09.431
Hey, babe, you want to drive?

14:09.478 --> 14:10.540
Sure, or you can.

14:10.651 --> 14:12.837
No, it's fine, I know you
don't like the way I drive.

14:12.990 --> 14:15.305
I don't have a problem
with your driving.

14:15.451 --> 14:16.540
Are you listening to this?

14:16.588 --> 14:18.235
They deceive each other
about everything.

14:18.283 --> 14:19.774
Shh.

14:21.782 --> 14:25.735
Just so you know, that guy
in the parking lot hit me.

14:25.821 --> 14:28.795
He wasn't in a car, but okay.

14:30.133 --> 14:31.618
Just say you want to drive.

14:31.674 --> 14:33.579
I honestly don't.

14:36.805 --> 14:39.274
Amy, do us a favor,
please drive.

14:39.423 --> 14:40.829
Sure, happy to.

14:40.877 --> 14:42.173
If you want to drive,
just drive.

14:42.221 --> 14:43.908
I don't see why this has
to be so complicated.

14:43.955 --> 14:46.087
It's not complicated.
Amy's driving, that's it!

14:46.152 --> 14:48.188
That's not it because
you're clearly upset.

14:48.236 --> 14:49.845
PENNY: You're the one
who seems upset.

14:49.893 --> 14:50.915
Why would I be upset?

14:50.963 --> 14:53.463
Because you don't want
her to go to Comic-Con!

14:56.016 --> 14:59.102
This is an interesting way
to stay out of it.

15:00.985 --> 15:02.712
Wait, you don't want me to go?

15:02.791 --> 15:05.876
Well, I just don't think
you're gonna have a good time.

15:05.924 --> 15:06.905
SHELDON:
Yeah, well, get this:

15:06.953 --> 15:07.899
neither does Penny,

15:07.947 --> 15:09.962
that's why she
doesn't want to go.

15:11.649 --> 15:14.095
You set 'em up,
I knock 'em down, good job.

15:15.344 --> 15:17.415
Why would you say you wanted
to go if you didn't?

15:17.424 --> 15:19.313
I just thought it
would make you happy.

15:19.361 --> 15:23.009
O-O-O-Okay, hold on,
so if you don't want to go

15:23.057 --> 15:27.024
and I don't need to bring you,
is everything good?

15:27.259 --> 15:30.454
Hold on, I'm trying to
decide if I'm mad at you.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.040
No, I'm happy I
don't have to go.

15:34.766 --> 15:35.937
All right, problem solved.

15:35.985 --> 15:36.914
Okay.

15:36.962 --> 15:38.016
Yeah. Not entirely,

15:38.064 --> 15:39.330
the fight over who's going
to drive is still...

15:39.377 --> 15:41.401
Oh, my God, stop talking!

15:44.054 --> 15:45.095
The place looks great.

15:45.143 --> 15:46.618
Did you guys get a maid?

15:46.784 --> 15:48.376
Kind of.

15:49.462 --> 15:51.015
WOLOWITZ:
Dinner's almost ready.

15:51.063 --> 15:54.040
If you like meatloaf, I'm
sure you'll like its cousin,

15:54.088 --> 15:56.646
bowl of meat.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.486
Hey, if you're still
looking to make money,

15:59.533 --> 16:02.149
I will pay you
to burn that jacket.

16:04.532 --> 16:06.238
Thank you,
but it doesn't look like

16:06.294 --> 16:07.958
I'm going to Comic-Con
this year.

16:08.154 --> 16:09.735
Well, with as much
debt as you have,

16:09.783 --> 16:11.774
probably not next year either.

16:13.743 --> 16:15.032
- Howie?
- Sure.

16:15.396 --> 16:17.259
This is for you.

16:18.884 --> 16:20.087
What's this?

16:20.160 --> 16:21.954
It's back pay
for all the babysitting

16:22.002 --> 16:23.704
and taking care of Halley
you've done.

16:23.803 --> 16:25.045
WOLOWITZ:
There's more than enough

16:25.092 --> 16:26.790
in there to cover Comic-Con.

16:26.969 --> 16:30.470
Um, I also take care of Halley.

16:32.070 --> 16:33.876
And you live here for free.

16:34.102 --> 16:36.204
I do, ma'am, thank you, ma'am.

16:37.315 --> 16:40.930
This is so generous of you,
I-I, um, I don't know what to say.

16:40.983 --> 16:42.157
Now you can come with us.

16:42.205 --> 16:44.997
Yeah, there's room in the
bed by Sheldon's feet.

16:46.985 --> 16:48.376
As much as I appreciate this,

16:48.424 --> 16:49.420
I can't accept it.

16:49.468 --> 16:51.126
Okay? Halley's my goddaughter,

16:51.174 --> 16:52.728
I don't take care of her
for money.

16:52.919 --> 16:54.845
I would.

16:57.946 --> 16:59.352
Keep it. Consider it a gift.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.766
- Do you want a...
- Hold on.

17:00.814 --> 17:02.602
Is it back pay or is it a gift?

17:02.650 --> 17:03.679
What's the difference?

17:03.741 --> 17:05.670
When the IRS questions us
in separate rooms,

17:05.726 --> 17:07.222
we need to have
our stories straight.

17:08.256 --> 17:09.285
KOOTHRAPPALI:
It doesn't matter.

17:09.332 --> 17:10.560
I'm not keeping this.

17:10.608 --> 17:12.803
I'm trying to pay my own
way and be responsible.

17:12.851 --> 17:14.530
Taking handouts won't help that.

17:14.694 --> 17:16.534
So you're not going
to Comic-Con?

17:16.582 --> 17:19.061
(sighs)
I've been plenty of times.

17:19.109 --> 17:21.708
If I miss one, it's fine.
I'm a big boy.

17:22.241 --> 17:24.053
I'm a big boy,
and if I missed one,

17:24.101 --> 17:26.295
I'd throw a big-boy tantrum.

17:28.162 --> 17:30.617
You know what?
I've gone 12 times.

17:30.798 --> 17:32.467
Maybe I'll sit out
this year, too.

17:32.515 --> 17:33.794
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:33.858 --> 17:35.922
Maybe you and I can do
something fun that weekend.

17:36.032 --> 17:38.272
Ooh, how about
white-water rafting?

17:38.383 --> 17:40.561
Oh... how about
we compromise

17:40.609 --> 17:43.935
and go on the Small World ride
at Disneyland?

17:45.717 --> 17:48.292
You know what, I'm
not gonna go either.

17:48.339 --> 17:50.077
I'm a father now.

17:50.163 --> 17:52.780
I'd rather spend time
with my family.

17:52.975 --> 17:54.375
You just don't want
to go alone with Sheldon.

17:54.422 --> 17:56.063
I'm gonna go check on dinner.

17:59.002 --> 18:00.944
Sounds like everyone's
staying home.

18:01.019 --> 18:02.569
What do you say?

18:02.905 --> 18:05.409
Nuts to that,
I'm going to Comic-Con!

18:06.249 --> 18:07.772
By yourself?

18:07.867 --> 18:08.938
Not necessarily.

18:08.986 --> 18:11.584
I have four months
to find some new friends.

18:11.818 --> 18:13.340
I'll go with you.

18:13.388 --> 18:15.043
That's very kind of you, Stuart.

18:15.174 --> 18:17.340
Check back in with me in July.

18:28.196 --> 18:31.318
There's my pretty girlfriend.

18:33.356 --> 18:35.887
I'm not going with you
to Comic-Con.

18:35.934 --> 18:39.381
What? Can't a man just be
happy to see his woman

18:39.428 --> 18:43.764
and pat her on her second most
erogenous ball-and-socket joint?

18:46.649 --> 18:49.603
He can, but it's still
not changing my mind.

18:50.946 --> 18:54.509
Well, maybe what's in my
pants will change your mind.

18:58.610 --> 19:01.477
It's a list of this
year's panelists.

19:05.587 --> 19:07.266
It's long, isn't it?
