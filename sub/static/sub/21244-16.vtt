- I thought you said
I was your greatest gift.
- Things change. Keep up.

So how did
you lovebirds meet?

04:07.250 --> 04:09.000

a prom date.

04:13.380 --> 04:15.670
[Betty laughing]

04:15.670 --> 04:18.420
It was so romantic.

04:18.420 --> 04:21.250
I went to his office
in gastric distress.

04:21.250 --> 04:24.250
Ooh, I was tootin'
more than a French horn.

04:25.380 --> 04:29.420
Well, feel free to skip to
the romantic part.

04:29.420 --> 04:32.330
To make a long story short,

04:32.330 --> 04:36.380
I said to her, "I can't
take out your gallbladder."

04:36.380 --> 04:39.040
And I said, "Why not?"
And he said...

04:39.040 --> 04:43.750
[both] Because I'd rather
take out the rest of you.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.330
And we've been together
ever since.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.380
You know, Betty,
you look really familiar.

04:52.380 --> 04:54.080
I guess I got
one of those kind of faces,

04:54.080 --> 04:56.210
because if we had met,
I would've remembered

04:56.210 --> 04:57.830
a beauty like you.

04:57.830 --> 05:00.290
[Earl] She is beautiful,
isn't she?

05:00.290 --> 05:01.880
Takes after her dad.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.170
Look at that
bone structure.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.330
Like you were carved
out of marble.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.040
Okay.

05:10.040 --> 05:13.750
Okay, thank you, Daddy.
Thanks.

05:13.750 --> 05:15.580
What is going on
with my father?

05:15.580 --> 05:17.290
What do you mean?

05:17.290 --> 05:19.290
This is a sign
of affection.

05:19.290 --> 05:20.920
The only other sign
I ever got from him

05:20.920 --> 05:22.710
was a "Do Not
Disturb Me" sign.

05:22.710 --> 05:25.710
Your dad's in
a good mood,

05:25.710 --> 05:27.830
because he's in love
and he's happy.

05:27.830 --> 05:30.250
So when he's happy,

05:30.250 --> 05:33.080
he actually likes me?

05:35.170 --> 05:37.250
Is it too soon
to call you Mommy?

05:39.290 --> 05:41.080
Oh, yeah.

05:44.250 --> 05:45.250
Psst.

05:48.290 --> 05:50.080
Don't tell Papa Earl
I told you,

05:50.080 --> 05:52.250
but we're eloping to
Las Vegas next week.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.750
[laughs]

05:53.750 --> 05:56.080
I never could
keep a secret.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.330
Secret, huh?

05:58.330 --> 06:00.460
Speaking of which,
don't tell your mom,

06:00.460 --> 06:04.170
but that bracelet,
16 bucks at
the airport gift shop.

06:04.170 --> 06:06.120
Mm-hm. My mama
always said,

06:06.120 --> 06:08.420
"Don't arrive
empty-handed,

06:08.420 --> 06:10.580
but don't arrive with
empty pockets either."

06:17.420 --> 06:19.830
I'm worried about Betty.

06:19.830 --> 06:21.420
She told me that
she couldn't keep a secret,

06:21.420 --> 06:23.170
it got me thinking.

06:23.170 --> 06:25.120
You remember that cold case
seminar that we took

06:25.120 --> 06:27.580
- at the Organization?
- Yeah, that was
a disappointment.

06:27.580 --> 06:30.540
I thought it was
a cold cuts seminar.

06:30.540 --> 06:33.330
The whole time they were
droning on about unsolved cases,

06:33.330 --> 06:36.210
and I was just hankering for
hard salami on pumpernickel.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.330
I was paying attention.

06:40.330 --> 06:43.580
Check out
this Margaret Turner case file.

06:43.580 --> 06:45.330
Okay, so in 1977,

06:45.330 --> 06:47.420
Margaret Turner
stole secret files

06:47.420 --> 06:49.170
that compromised
the Organization's agents

06:49.170 --> 06:50.920
all over the world.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.250
The Organization tracked her
to a hotel on F Street,

06:53.250 --> 06:55.170
but the only thing
they found

06:55.170 --> 06:57.210
was a half-eaten room service
waffle and a hairbrush.

06:57.210 --> 06:59.620
What a waste of
a perfectly good waffle.

07:01.380 --> 07:04.210
Anyway...

07:04.210 --> 07:07.000
this was the only known
photo of Margaret Turner.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.330
See? Right there.
That is her,

07:09.330 --> 07:12.040
the woman who's been using
our decorative hand towels,

07:12.040 --> 07:15.250
Margaret Turner,
the traitor.

07:15.250 --> 07:17.000
I don't know
what you're talking about.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.620
That doesn't look
like Gammy to me.

07:18.620 --> 07:20.920
She's not our Gammy.

07:20.920 --> 07:23.380
Look, Judy, can you use
your photo recognition software?

07:25.420 --> 07:27.580
I can confirm,
it is definitely...

07:29.880 --> 07:32.000
an old grainy image
of a woman

07:32.000 --> 07:34.420
who may or may not be
our Gammy Betty.

07:34.420 --> 07:36.420
Not our Gammy.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.420
Guys, come on, don't you
find it a little suspicious

07:39.420 --> 07:41.290
that, out of nowhere,

07:41.290 --> 07:44.420
suddenly some woman falls
in love with Papa Earl?

07:44.420 --> 07:46.250
I think you should
find it inspiring.

07:46.250 --> 07:47.830
It may take
another 50 years,

07:47.830 --> 07:50.670
but you'll find
a prom date eventually.

07:57.460 --> 08:00.460
Earl, I don't think
I've seen you this happy.

08:00.460 --> 08:02.710
That Betty has put
a sparkle in your eye.

08:02.710 --> 08:04.580
And a hop in my step.

08:04.580 --> 08:07.080
Not to mention, she put
baking soda in my fridge.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.120
Apparently, it smelled
like fish and whatnot.

08:10.420 --> 08:14.170
It's so good to have
a woman back in my life.

08:14.170 --> 08:15.380
Well, it's been a pleasure
getting to know Betty,

08:15.380 --> 08:16.540
and she should
get to know me.

08:16.540 --> 08:19.290
Let her know that
my birthstone is Sapphire.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.920
I mean, you deserve
every bit of happiness.

08:23.290 --> 08:25.580
The happier you are,
the happier I am.

08:25.580 --> 08:27.710
And that's why
you are my favorite son.

08:27.710 --> 08:29.580
Technically,
he's your only son.

08:29.580 --> 08:31.250
Hey, don't be
correcting my daddy.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.960
He said I'm his favorite,
so I'm his favorite.

08:34.170 --> 08:37.380
Hey, Dad, can I talk
to you for a second

08:37.380 --> 08:39.920
- in the backyard?
- Yeah, sure.

08:43.460 --> 08:46.330
Look, Dad, I, uh,
I have some information.

08:46.330 --> 08:49.790
It turns out that Betty's
real name is Margaret Turner.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.710
She's a traitor who sold
Organization secrets

08:51.710 --> 08:54.330
- back in the 1970's.
- How do you know it's her?

08:54.330 --> 08:56.290
I looked into the Organization
cold case files,

08:56.290 --> 08:57.920
and I found a picture.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.080
Are you kidding me?

09:01.080 --> 09:04.080
I've seen pictures of Bigfoot
clearer than this.

09:04.080 --> 09:06.250
Uh, excuse me.

09:06.250 --> 09:09.040
I have more proof.
Yeah.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.290
She told me
she couldn't keep a secret.

09:11.290 --> 09:13.210
And get this.

09:13.210 --> 09:14.790
Mom's fancy little bracelet,

09:14.790 --> 09:17.080
airport gift shop.

09:17.080 --> 09:20.540
Do you know how crazy
you sound right now?

09:20.540 --> 09:22.420
Listen.

09:22.420 --> 09:25.420
My dad is happy, which means
he suddenly likes me.

09:25.420 --> 09:26.960
I don't wanna hear
another word about this

09:26.960 --> 09:28.380
unless you have real proof.

09:28.380 --> 09:30.830
[laughing]
Oh, good morning.

09:30.830 --> 09:33.080
Come on in, everybody.
I'm makin' waffles!

09:35.040 --> 09:37.420
Yeah.

09:37.420 --> 09:39.540
That!
That right there.

09:39.540 --> 09:42.080
That was another
piece of information
in the file.

09:42.080 --> 09:45.380
Margaret Turner
liked waffles.

09:50.830 --> 09:52.960
Who's crazy now?

09:55.170 --> 09:57.750
KC, everybody likes waffles.

09:57.750 --> 10:00.210
They have
syrup-holding pockets!

10:02.380 --> 10:05.080
Get proof
or get lost.

10:09.540 --> 10:11.420
Doesn't look like
Bigfoot to me.

10:17.040 --> 10:20.790
Well, so...

10:20.790 --> 10:22.210
What are you girls
up to?

10:22.210 --> 10:23.580
Judy and I?

10:23.580 --> 10:25.420
We were just
playing this little game

10:25.420 --> 10:27.790
I like to play;
you should join.

10:27.790 --> 10:30.000
It's called "Where Was I
In the Spring of 1977"?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.330
Okay, I'll go first.
Um...

10:32.330 --> 10:34.880
I wasn't born.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.250
Uh, Judy, how about you?

10:36.250 --> 10:38.460
Oh, wasn't born either.
[forced laughter]

10:38.460 --> 10:40.000
So, Betty, you're up.

10:42.330 --> 10:44.170
KC, can I tell you
a little secret?

10:44.170 --> 10:46.330
Not that you could
stop yourself.

10:46.330 --> 10:48.620
My memory's
not what it used to be.

10:48.620 --> 10:51.170
1977...

10:51.170 --> 10:53.290
I can barely remember

10:53.290 --> 10:55.620
what I ate for breakfast
this morning.

10:57.670 --> 10:59.790
It was waffles.

10:59.790 --> 11:01.380
Waffles and lies.

11:02.420 --> 11:04.960
KC, did you ever
just consider

11:04.960 --> 11:07.620
she's just a nice lady
who likes your grandfather?

11:07.620 --> 11:09.540
Oh, go charge yourself.

11:13.330 --> 11:15.880
- Hey.
- What is that?

11:15.880 --> 11:18.170
Just a little project
I've been working on.

11:18.170 --> 11:19.460
Are you doing schoolwork?

11:19.460 --> 11:20.710
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

11:23.170 --> 11:24.960
I came up with a solution

11:24.960 --> 11:27.880
to your little
prom-blem.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.710
Prom-blem.
Did you see what I did there?

11:32.710 --> 11:36.380
Yeah. In fact, they can
see it from the space station.

11:36.380 --> 11:38.500
Look, I thought, instead
of waiting for some guy

11:38.500 --> 11:40.330
to ask you, why don't
you do the asking?

11:40.330 --> 11:42.080
I would, but
everybody's taken.

11:42.080 --> 11:45.290
Bup-bup-bup.
I have here in my hands

11:45.290 --> 11:47.880
the board of availability.

11:49.830 --> 11:52.330
Here's a list of
every available guy in school,

11:52.330 --> 11:54.040
along with their
height, weight,

11:54.040 --> 11:55.750
and likelihood
to rent a limo.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.210
You know,
the important things.

11:57.210 --> 11:59.460
What about
their personalities?

11:59.460 --> 12:00.960
Tick-tock,
you want a date or not?

12:02.420 --> 12:04.790
Now just pick
any one of these guys.

12:04.790 --> 12:05.830
[phone chimes]

12:05.830 --> 12:08.120
No, except Bobby Wilcox.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.380
[phone chimes]

12:10.380 --> 12:12.380
And Bobby Whitsett.

12:13.790 --> 12:16.580
Marisa, give it up.
This whole thing is hopeless.

12:16.580 --> 12:19.210
Oh, come on, KC.
Don't give up the fight.

12:19.210 --> 12:21.330
There's still plenty
of available guys

12:21.330 --> 12:23.420
at Franklin, Roseland,
and Morgan Park.

12:23.420 --> 12:25.210
Marisa, those are all
junior high schools.

12:25.210 --> 12:28.170
Hey, you know what?
Some of those guys
are really mature.

12:35.330 --> 12:36.620
[KC coughing]

12:36.620 --> 12:38.710
[Ernie coughing]

12:38.710 --> 12:42.790
Okay, so we need to find
Margaret Turner's case file,

12:42.790 --> 12:45.620
and then we need to get
the hairbrush out of it
so we can have a DNA sample.

12:45.620 --> 12:47.710
Wow, this cold case
storage room

12:47.710 --> 12:49.750
has more dirt
than Marisa's diary.

12:49.750 --> 12:51.420
How would you know?

12:51.420 --> 12:53.380
I didn't become a hacker
just to save the world.

12:55.830 --> 12:58.330
All right,
the case files should be

12:58.330 --> 13:00.620
in section five.

13:00.620 --> 13:03.380
Row...

13:03.380 --> 13:05.580
double R,

13:05.580 --> 13:07.250
which is all the way
up there.

13:07.250 --> 13:09.710
Ernie, start
climbing.

13:09.710 --> 13:12.040
Why do I have to climb?
Why can't we send Judy?

13:12.040 --> 13:14.290
Because if I fall,
it'll cost a lot of money

13:14.290 --> 13:17.250
to repair me, but if
you fall, no one'll care.

13:17.250 --> 13:20.670
I'll care!

13:20.670 --> 13:22.580
Listen, Papa Earl's happiness
depends on what we find.

13:22.580 --> 13:24.380
Come on, man,
start climbing.

13:24.380 --> 13:26.380
[sighs]
All right.

13:26.380 --> 13:28.420
Just so you know,
if I fall,

13:28.420 --> 13:29.620
I'm aiming for you.

13:36.710 --> 13:40.290
Not seeing a row double R
up here, guys,

13:40.290 --> 13:42.790
but I do see
some tiny adorable puppies.

13:42.790 --> 13:45.000
Wait, they're not puppies.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.210
They're rats.

13:46.210 --> 13:47.380
Rats?!

13:47.380 --> 13:49.420
[shrieking]

13:51.790 --> 13:54.290
Oh, look at that.

13:54.290 --> 13:56.420
Section five, row double R
was down here all along.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.420
Perfect. There's still
some hair on it.

14:02.420 --> 14:05.670
Great. Now we just have to get
Betty's DNA and compare the two.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.290
In case anyone was wondering,
I'm okay.

14:08.290 --> 14:10.380
The rats broke my fall.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
[snoring]

14:24.000 --> 14:25.250
How do we get
her DNA?

14:25.250 --> 14:27.080
Blood's always best.

14:29.880 --> 14:32.790
Don't you dare.

14:32.790 --> 14:35.710
Look, all we're gonna do
is get a strand of her hair,

14:35.710 --> 14:37.120
and then compare
the DNA samples.

14:37.120 --> 14:39.500
Go ahead, Ernie.

14:39.500 --> 14:42.170
What's with
the "go ahead, Ernie"?

14:42.170 --> 14:44.290
You pull the strand of hair.

14:44.290 --> 14:47.080
I already fell off
a shelving unit and took
out a family of rats.

14:47.080 --> 14:49.330
I like the woman.
You're the one who's suspicious.

14:49.330 --> 14:50.580
You do it.

14:52.420 --> 14:54.420
Okay, fine.
Nobody needs you.

14:54.420 --> 14:56.000
Judy, go ahead.

15:09.210 --> 15:10.540
Sh!

15:22.250 --> 15:24.380
Okay, Plan B.

15:25.540 --> 15:27.830
I'll get the DNA.

15:29.380 --> 15:30.830
Goin' in.

15:36.460 --> 15:38.380
Get in there good.

15:38.380 --> 15:40.330
Massage those gums.

15:40.330 --> 15:43.170
It's where
the good DNA is.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.170
I don't know
how you do it in D.C.,

15:50.170 --> 15:52.330
but in Atlanta,

15:52.330 --> 15:55.000
we don't stick our fingers
in the houseguests' mouths.

15:56.460 --> 15:58.880
Or anyplace else,
for that matter.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.170
Would you like to tell me,
what were you doing?

16:01.170 --> 16:03.460
Oh, we just, um...

16:03.460 --> 16:05.290
we noticed that you had
a little something

16:05.290 --> 16:07.080
stuck in your teeth
from lunch, and so,

16:07.080 --> 16:09.210
we didn't want you
to be too embarrassed.

16:09.210 --> 16:12.330
So wakin' up with
your hand in my mouth,
that's less embarrassing?

16:12.330 --> 16:15.960
- We're glad you agree.
- [nervous laughter]

16:15.960 --> 16:18.290
Okay, guys, how about we let
Betty and her clean teeth

16:18.290 --> 16:19.960
nap in peace?

16:19.960 --> 16:22.120
I told you we should've
gone with blood.

16:22.120 --> 16:23.330
Sh!

16:29.670 --> 16:32.250
KC, if this is about
that old spy case again,

16:32.250 --> 16:34.290
you better have
foolproof proof.

16:34.290 --> 16:36.420
Dad, we do. Okay?

16:36.420 --> 16:38.960
Judy ran the DNA test,
and it turns out,

16:38.960 --> 16:41.500
it's a 99% match.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.170
So what I'm hearing is,

16:44.170 --> 16:47.210
there's still a one percent
chance you're wrong.

16:47.210 --> 16:49.250
And I'm not about
to risk my happiness
over one percent.

16:49.250 --> 16:50.920
You mean
Papa Earl's happiness?

16:50.920 --> 16:52.710
No, mine.

16:52.710 --> 16:56.290
Look, I finally got
the dad I always wanted.

16:56.290 --> 16:59.670
I can laugh with him,
I can hang out with him.

16:59.670 --> 17:02.170
I'm not ready
to give that up.

17:02.170 --> 17:04.500
Craig, honey, look,
I know this is upsetting,

17:04.500 --> 17:06.250
but we have
a moral responsibility

17:06.250 --> 17:08.040
to enforce the law.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.380
But I still think I can
morally keep the jewelry.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.920
Hey, Dad.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.790
How about me, you,
and Ernie go out for
a little bachelor party?

17:21.790 --> 17:24.580
Isn't Ernie a little young
for a bachelor party?

17:24.580 --> 17:27.710
Aren't you a little old
for one?

17:29.330 --> 17:33.250
I tell you, Craig,
this guy is even funnier
than his haircut.

17:34.290 --> 17:36.290
He must get
his sense of humor from you.

17:36.290 --> 17:38.000
Oh, come on, Dad.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.620
[rueful chuckling]
I'm gonna miss happy Daddy.

17:45.540 --> 17:47.830
So, Betty,

17:47.830 --> 17:49.750
guess it's just
us gals, huh?

17:49.750 --> 17:52.830
Oh, are we having
a bachelorette party?

17:52.830 --> 17:55.540
Because if a policeman comes in
carrying a boom box,

17:55.540 --> 17:58.120
and wearing a rip-away shirt
shows up, I'm in.

17:59.290 --> 18:01.420
Well, there definitely
gonna be policemen involved.

18:01.420 --> 18:04.210
Just not the dancing kind.

18:04.210 --> 18:06.880
Do you know who had a really
super fun bachelorette party?

18:06.880 --> 18:10.880
My twin sister when she
remarried a few years ago.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.250
I woke up with this.
Look.

18:14.710 --> 18:15.790
"Beast mode"?

18:15.790 --> 18:18.000
Seemed like
a good idea at the time.

18:19.290 --> 18:21.790
Did it?
Did it really?

18:23.250 --> 18:25.120
Okay, wait, you have
a twin sister?

18:25.120 --> 18:27.710
Mm-hmm. Identical
twin sister. Midge.

18:27.710 --> 18:31.380
And I know this is obvious,
but she's gorgeous.

18:32.710 --> 18:35.210
Wait a minute, your twin
sister's name is Midge?

18:35.210 --> 18:37.420
Which is short
for Margaret.

18:37.420 --> 18:40.710
Which explains why it was
only a 99% match.

18:40.710 --> 18:44.330
Um, Betty,
out of curiosity,

18:44.330 --> 18:45.670
where does Margaret live?

18:45.670 --> 18:49.080
Some remote island
off of Puget Sound.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.210
I swear, the woman's
such a recluse.

18:52.880 --> 18:56.250
Not for long.
She's about to get
a couple of visitors.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.210
Who is it?!

19:05.210 --> 19:06.670
Delivery.

19:06.670 --> 19:08.330
Oh, yeah?

19:08.330 --> 19:10.920
Well, I got something
for you, too.

19:13.460 --> 19:15.330
You'll never
take me alive.

19:15.330 --> 19:17.250
All right,
we're going in.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.290
[laser blasts,
glass breaking]

19:29.330 --> 19:31.290
Let me guess.

19:31.290 --> 19:32.880
Betty sold me out.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.580
She never could
keep a secret.

19:40.210 --> 19:43.580
All right, KC,
I finally found
the perfect prom date for you.

19:43.580 --> 19:45.750
Marisa, please,
I do not wanna hear
the word prom

19:45.750 --> 19:47.710
for as long as I live.

19:47.710 --> 19:50.000
No, no, I told you
someone special's gonna ask you,

19:50.000 --> 19:51.790
and I was right.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.580
Okay, no, please,
tell me.

19:53.580 --> 19:56.380
Who is this special,
magical person

19:56.380 --> 19:58.750
who's gonna show up and make
all my prom dreams come true?

20:02.120 --> 20:04.790
KC Cooper, will you please
do me the honor

20:04.790 --> 20:07.710
of being my prom date?

20:09.250 --> 20:11.580
Aww, Marisa,
that's so sweet.

20:11.580 --> 20:13.330
Look, I don't care
how many guys asked me.

20:13.330 --> 20:16.000
There's no one I'd have
a better time with than you.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.420
In that case...

20:18.420 --> 20:19.460
it's a yes.

20:19.460 --> 20:20.920
Yay!

20:20.920 --> 20:22.670
But on one condition.

20:22.670 --> 20:24.250
I'm not wearing a dress.

20:24.250 --> 20:25.880
Oh, no, you're lucky
you have a date at all.

20:25.880 --> 20:28.540
You'll wear
that I tell you to wear.

20:28.540 --> 20:30.960
And I have narrowed it
down to six options,
so I'm gonna go get 'em.

20:37.210 --> 20:39.380
Well, it was so nice
meeting everyone,

20:39.380 --> 20:41.080
and thank you for
your hospitality.

20:41.080 --> 20:43.420
You are welcome here
any time,

20:43.420 --> 20:45.880
and don't feel it necessary
to bring any more of
your amazing gifts,

20:45.880 --> 20:48.080
especially the diamond-cut
earrings that match
this bracelet.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.500
No, you don't have to.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.670
Unless you want to.

20:52.670 --> 20:54.750
Well, when it comes to
my daughter-in-law,

20:54.750 --> 20:56.880
I spare no expense.

20:59.290 --> 21:01.960
KC, give Papa Earl
a big old hug.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.750
Aww, we're gonna
miss you, Papa Earl.

21:03.750 --> 21:05.960
And you, too,
Gammy.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.420
Oh!

21:07.420 --> 21:09.460
And I can't wait for you
to meet the family

21:09.460 --> 21:11.830
at Christmas, especially
my twin sister.

21:11.830 --> 21:13.420
If she ever calls me back.

21:13.420 --> 21:14.960
I'm sure she'll
call you back...

21:14.960 --> 21:17.420
collect from prison.

21:17.420 --> 21:20.250
Hey, Dad, um,
I just wanted to say,

21:20.250 --> 21:23.420
um, this was
the best visit ever,

21:23.420 --> 21:25.330
and I really appreciate
the way you treated me.

21:25.330 --> 21:27.540
What are you
talkin' about?

21:27.540 --> 21:29.210
What nonsense is that?

21:29.210 --> 21:30.540
Come on, Dad.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.620
I know I got
on your nerves.

21:32.620 --> 21:33.960
Always have.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.210
But now you got Betty,
and you're happy.

21:36.210 --> 21:37.620
You're nice to me.

21:39.250 --> 21:42.080
I know we've had
our differences, son,

21:42.080 --> 21:44.170
but I love you

21:44.170 --> 21:45.580
with all my heart,

21:45.580 --> 21:48.290
and I have since
the day you were born.

21:48.290 --> 21:50.830
I guess I'm just
getting better

21:50.830 --> 21:52.460
at expressing it.

21:55.250 --> 21:57.250
I love you, too, Daddy.

21:57.250 --> 21:58.380
Now get outta my house,
old man.

21:58.380 --> 22:00.960
I don't wanna
see you till Christmas.
