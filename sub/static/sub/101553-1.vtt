M_I_S_ForEver

02:59.705 --> 03:01.290
The prey's approaching the kill box.

03:01.624 --> 03:04.084
<i>Activate the poison darts.
Safeties off.</i>

03:22.561 --> 03:23.562
Fire!

03:23.854 --> 03:24.897
Yeah!

03:30.277 --> 03:31.278
Come on!

03:31.362 --> 03:32.446
Recharge!

03:37.368 --> 03:39.203
Wherever you are, let's go!

03:48.087 --> 03:49.672
I can't believe
we didn't kill that thing.

03:49.755 --> 03:51.590
I know.
We hit it hard, didn't we?

03:51.674 --> 03:54.677
No one said it was gonna
be easy to take this prey,

03:55.010 --> 03:59.431
but we wanted a challenge,
gentlemen, and, well, we got one.

03:59.932 --> 04:00.933
No worries.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.686
We're gonna bag
this little baby tomorrow.

04:04.478 --> 04:05.479
All right?

04:06.564 --> 04:07.606
Hey, Bill,

04:09.608 --> 04:10.776
this feel right to you?

04:10.860 --> 04:12.862
Yeah, it's disappointing,
but we'll get him. Why?

04:13.279 --> 04:15.489
I mean, we hit that thing
with a serious dose of Special K,

04:15.573 --> 04:17.241
and he just shook it off
like it was nothing.

04:17.322 --> 04:20.369
Super predators have
a bad habit of being tough as nails.

04:20.536 --> 04:22.788
Hoof! Tough hunt.

04:22.872 --> 04:23.873
Yep.

04:24.165 --> 04:25.791
No trophy mount for these slack-jawed

04:25.875 --> 04:27.501
hipster hunters from Silicon Valley.

04:27.585 --> 04:29.753
Hey, they paid
big money for this hunt.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.088
Yeah, I should hope so.

04:31.172 --> 04:33.090
I mean, how often
do you get to hunt a super predator

04:33.174 --> 04:35.009
whose genetic code's been hacked?

04:35.092 --> 04:36.969
A mega-super predator.

04:37.803 --> 04:38.804
Even better.

04:38.888 --> 04:40.598
I mean, you tinkered with evolution,

04:40.681 --> 04:41.891
so a bunch of tech geeks

04:42.099 --> 04:45.060
could hang exotic
trophy mounts on their office walls.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.478
Too bloody right.

04:46.854 --> 04:50.482
We didn't come
all this way to shoot clay pigeons.

04:50.566 --> 04:52.193
Come on, Anna.
We've been in a lot of hunts together,

04:52.276 --> 04:53.611
and this one's no different.

04:53.736 --> 04:56.322
Yeah, but those were fair fights, Bill,
not vanity hunts.

04:56.405 --> 04:59.283
Hey, come on.
What's going on, Anna?

04:59.825 --> 05:00.826
I don't know.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.746
There's something
about this hunt just doesn't feel right.

05:03.829 --> 05:05.414
We're gonna put
this baby down tomorrow,

05:05.498 --> 05:07.458
and you'll feel better then.
You always do.

05:07.833 --> 05:10.211
Now come on,
let's go drink some expensive booze,

05:10.294 --> 05:12.963
and show
these Silicon Valley jokers a good time.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.508
Come on.
You're gonna enjoy it.

05:16.425 --> 05:18.427
Hey, boys,
let's move on out.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.804
We got some steaks on the grill

05:21.013 --> 05:22.973
and some cold vodka in the freezer.

05:23.224 --> 05:24.725
That's what I'm talking about.

06:12.898 --> 06:14.275
- Hey, Ishiman!
- Hi.

06:14.358 --> 06:15.609
How are you doing?

06:17.111 --> 06:20.614
Hello. Hello...

06:22.449 --> 06:23.951
That's a good girl.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.317
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.320
Volcanic island.
Just some minor seismic activity.

06:59.403 --> 07:01.363
If you want, I'll wrangle up the data.

07:01.447 --> 07:02.823
Yeah. Do that, will you?

07:04.366 --> 07:05.493
Where's Jimmy?

07:05.576 --> 07:06.577
Recovering.

07:07.328 --> 07:09.538
We played Flip, Sip or Strip last night.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.665
He didn't even make it past Sip.

07:19.965 --> 07:21.634
- Let's go, Jimmy.
- What?

07:21.717 --> 07:23.594
Rise and shine.

07:26.305 --> 07:27.431
Fart in a bag.

07:27.765 --> 07:31.894
My team's supposed to be GPS tagging
the elephants today, right?

07:32.811 --> 07:34.688
Am I missing it?

07:34.980 --> 07:36.023
Coffee?

07:36.357 --> 07:38.108
Lovely. Cream?

07:38.192 --> 07:39.860
- Two sugars.
- Awesome.

07:40.361 --> 07:41.362
Are you hungover?

07:42.238 --> 07:43.447
No.

07:44.615 --> 07:45.699
Yes.

07:45.950 --> 07:46.951
Sorry.

07:48.285 --> 07:49.495
Are you angry?

07:49.578 --> 07:52.957
No. But your crew is
doing all the work over there.

07:53.916 --> 07:56.794
Well, it's kind
of what they're supposed to do, right?

07:56.877 --> 08:00.756
Uh, yeah, but you're the one with
the PhD in Conservation Biology.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.259
Yes, yes, Jas.
I get it. I get it,

08:03.843 --> 08:04.844
but look at it this way,

08:05.594 --> 08:08.764
I'm practicing my leadership skills.

08:09.390 --> 08:11.892
Delegation, empowerment.

08:11.976 --> 08:15.312
Yeah, but you can't
skip over inspiring others.

08:15.604 --> 08:18.357
Commitment and passion,
leading by example.

08:18.440 --> 08:21.235
All right, all right.
And don't forget the all-important

08:22.278 --> 08:24.321
"falling out of the hammock
and getting to work."

08:24.405 --> 08:25.406
Exactly.

08:25.489 --> 08:26.657
Let's go.

08:41.044 --> 08:44.174
Hey, Jas. I wrangled up
all the data from the networks

08:44.258 --> 08:46.385
and ran an analysis
for out-of-the-ordinary signals

08:46.468 --> 08:48.095
- on a real-time basis.
- And?

08:48.179 --> 08:52.057
And it's just no volcanic reawakening.
Just some minor seismic activity.

08:55.269 --> 08:56.437
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Sorry.

08:56.770 --> 08:57.771
You good?

08:57.855 --> 09:01.275
- Uh, yeah, I am peachy. Thanks for asking.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:01.358 --> 09:04.820
Red Bull, vodka, it's not a good,
you know, combo.

09:04.904 --> 09:07.781
Shoot.
I didn't make it past Sip, did I?

09:07.865 --> 09:09.658
- You never do.
- No.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.137
What's Bill doing over there?

09:30.221 --> 09:33.432
That's Bill's private island, Jas.
You know the deal, no trespassing.

09:33.516 --> 09:35.726
Let's go see what he's up to.

11:52.905 --> 11:55.991
Looks like something punched its way out
from inside this thing.

11:59.703 --> 12:01.288
It's about 30 feet.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.882
This is an exoskeleton.

12:14.635 --> 12:16.804
They had dorsal back convex.

12:16.887 --> 12:19.890
Dermal armor.
What the hell is this thing?

12:25.896 --> 12:26.981
It can't be.

12:28.566 --> 12:29.567
It can't be what?

12:34.822 --> 12:36.448
There's something in those trees.

12:36.699 --> 12:39.410
Yeah. Let's...

12:58.304 --> 13:00.806
Okay, I'm gonna
start leading by example and run.

13:00.890 --> 13:02.266
I suggest you do the same!

13:03.976 --> 13:05.603
Ishiman! Come on!

13:20.618 --> 13:21.619
Ishi!

13:22.036 --> 13:23.496
What are you doing, man? Come on!

13:30.377 --> 13:31.629
Ishi, come on, man! Let's go!

13:33.297 --> 13:34.423
Ishi!

13:55.402 --> 13:56.403
Ishi!

14:08.833 --> 14:09.834
Ishi!

14:13.337 --> 14:14.421
Come on, Ishi!

14:15.714 --> 14:18.467
Come on, Ishi! You can do it!

14:23.639 --> 14:25.850
Ishi! Ishi!

14:59.800 --> 15:01.927
What the hell was
that thing that killed Ishi, Jas?

15:02.761 --> 15:04.430
I don't know exactly.

15:05.764 --> 15:07.683
I tried to help him, but...

15:07.766 --> 15:10.895
I tried to help him.
I did my best. I did, Jas, but...

15:10.978 --> 15:13.105
There was nothing you could do.

15:15.691 --> 15:17.693
I need you to find
Burt Gummer for me, Jimmy.

15:18.319 --> 15:21.572
Me? Well, why not Travis?

15:21.739 --> 15:23.407
I mean, they're partners, aren't they?

15:24.408 --> 15:26.535
Travis is in a Mexican jail.

15:27.703 --> 15:30.331
Don't ask. Long story.

15:30.831 --> 15:33.000
I need you to head out now.

15:33.083 --> 15:34.168
Head out where?

15:34.251 --> 15:37.087
The last coordinates
I got for his location

15:37.880 --> 15:39.048
are Papua New Guinea.

16:40.442 --> 16:41.944
Mr. Gummer!

16:44.655 --> 16:45.948
Yo, Mr. Gummer!

16:48.784 --> 16:50.244
Help! Help!

16:53.372 --> 16:54.373
Oh, jeez.

17:09.137 --> 17:12.016
Mr. Gummer.
Thank goodness it's you.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.517
For a second there,
I thought I was gonna get cannibalized,

17:14.893 --> 17:17.229
but I'm not, right?

17:22.817 --> 17:24.652
- 50K says she can't do that again.
- Ah!

17:26.446 --> 17:29.241
I'll take the other side
of that action at two to one.

17:29.325 --> 17:31.035
You want a double-pop, slick?

17:31.327 --> 17:34.163
I'd prefer three to one, actually,
but I believe you don't have the balls.

17:36.540 --> 17:37.708
Step up! Go ahead, Bowtie!

17:37.791 --> 17:39.084
Triple-pop. You got it.

17:39.460 --> 17:41.462
You fools have more money than sense.

17:41.545 --> 17:42.630
Right, Bill?

17:42.713 --> 17:43.714
Come on, Bowtie!

17:43.797 --> 17:46.217
What, they teach you how to bet at Yale,
slick? 'Cause that's a loser.

17:46.467 --> 17:49.011
Anna, darling, I don't lose.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.264
Hey, double that bet,
Wall Street!

17:52.723 --> 17:57.186
Okay, good.
Well, then here's the game, gentlemen.

17:57.269 --> 17:58.395
Watch this.

17:58.479 --> 18:02.233
Mr. Bowtie
over here goes across the bridge

18:02.316 --> 18:05.152
and puts an apple
on his head, and I'ma shoot it off.

18:05.653 --> 18:07.363
- Whoa!
- You just got volunteered, my man.

18:07.446 --> 18:10.658
Okay. And you'll be facing
the opposite direction

18:11.075 --> 18:12.326
while looking into a mirror.

18:12.409 --> 18:13.744
Well, that makes it more interesting.

18:13.828 --> 18:14.912
I like it.

18:14.995 --> 18:16.288
You're gonna love this, slick,

18:16.372 --> 18:18.999
'cause the bid's
just gone up to 250,000

18:19.083 --> 18:23.212
at three to one
and we don't do margin betting.

18:23.295 --> 18:24.296
Oh, man!

18:24.380 --> 18:25.464
You got the swag?

18:25.548 --> 18:28.133
Anna, darling,
I have more in my piggybank.

18:28.217 --> 18:29.260
Oh!

18:29.635 --> 18:33.097
Now you see why I hired her.
She's a real piece of work.

18:33.180 --> 18:36.642
You're about to add
750K to your net worth.

18:36.725 --> 18:38.102
Now that's a lot of Jack.

18:39.395 --> 18:40.437
You sure?

18:40.855 --> 18:43.983
Don't worry.
If I miss, I'll miss high.

18:46.986 --> 18:48.696
Bring me that mirror, baby.

18:51.824 --> 18:53.450
- Hey, Bowtie.
- Yeah?

18:53.534 --> 18:54.660
You forgot something.

18:55.995 --> 18:57.955
That's a good start.

19:09.091 --> 19:10.176
Good luck.

19:10.259 --> 19:11.385
Come on, baby.

19:11.760 --> 19:14.597
I once saw a guy shit
his pants when she did this.

19:54.637 --> 19:56.013
What a nice shot!

19:56.138 --> 19:57.598
Shouldn't have
doubted me, slick!

19:57.681 --> 19:58.891
Bullseye!

20:02.061 --> 20:03.145
Wow.

20:04.313 --> 20:05.689
I can't believe that.

20:05.773 --> 20:07.483
You're lucky, boy.
You're lucky.

20:08.484 --> 20:10.528
I wonder what Goldilocks wants.

20:11.904 --> 20:13.614
How long you say
you've been here?

20:13.697 --> 20:16.909
186 days.
How'd you track me down?

20:16.992 --> 20:19.578
Travis Welker gave
your coordinates to my boss.

20:19.662 --> 20:20.746
It was very sweet of him.

20:22.081 --> 20:23.374
Turncoat!

20:24.208 --> 20:25.584
My own flesh and blood.

20:25.835 --> 20:31.423
Uh, look, I'm here
'cause we need your brand of expertise.

20:31.507 --> 20:34.885
Let me guess. Graboids?

20:34.969 --> 20:35.970
Wait, how'd you know?

20:36.053 --> 20:37.805
Somehow, they always find me.

20:39.181 --> 20:42.017
Not this time. I'm retired.

20:42.768 --> 20:46.856
Yeah, well, it sounds like
someone's got a little PTGD.

20:51.152 --> 20:56.073
That's Post Traumatic Graboid Disorder,
not the "Stress," the "Graboid," see...

20:58.576 --> 21:00.077
Hey, you know what they say?

21:00.161 --> 21:04.248
One sometimes finds his destiny
on the path to avoid it.

21:04.331 --> 21:07.751
Beats the hell out of civilization
with all its rules and regs.

21:08.252 --> 21:11.380
The State of Nevada ordered me
to hook up a sewer...

21:11.714 --> 21:12.715
You know what that means?

21:12.840 --> 21:14.592
Uh, sanitation?

21:14.842 --> 21:16.552
Sanitation, my ass.

21:16.927 --> 21:22.516
It means permits, government
inspectors, bureaucracy.

21:23.184 --> 21:27.229
It's one big
self-licking ice cream cone.

21:27.563 --> 21:32.193
The government gets your spore,
it gets your DNA.

21:32.568 --> 21:36.947
You know, one of those things
killed my friend.

21:37.031 --> 21:38.616
We need you.

21:38.699 --> 21:41.827
You do not. Travis Welker,
he's your go-to man now.

21:41.952 --> 21:44.622
Travis Welker, he's, well,
he's technically unavailable.

21:44.705 --> 21:46.123
Some things never change.

21:46.707 --> 21:48.000
Look, you don't get it.

21:48.083 --> 21:52.254
The bottom line is, if we don't
do something, more people will die.

21:52.338 --> 21:54.089
You're the only one who can help us.

21:55.883 --> 21:59.011
- An island, you say?
- Yeah.

21:59.762 --> 22:00.763
Population?

22:01.180 --> 22:02.890
Eight hundred indigenous people,

22:03.057 --> 22:05.017
plus researchers and scientists.

22:05.559 --> 22:08.562
Look, it's your destiny, Mr. Gummer.

22:09.188 --> 22:10.272
Your destiny.

22:51.355 --> 22:52.898
Destiny's a bitch.

22:55.609 --> 23:00.156
Importing illegal predators
onto an island sanctuary?

23:00.406 --> 23:01.407
Whiskey?

23:01.740 --> 23:03.075
This isn't a social call.

23:04.952 --> 23:06.162
Your island,

23:07.580 --> 23:09.081
what did you unleash over there?

23:09.874 --> 23:11.625
You've been snooping like a cat.

23:12.418 --> 23:14.336
You know what curiosity did.

23:14.587 --> 23:17.173
I know it killed
one of my men over there today.

23:17.548 --> 23:20.009
God, Jas.
I didn't know.

23:20.593 --> 23:21.886
I'm sorry.

23:22.511 --> 23:23.679
What can I do to help?

23:23.762 --> 23:25.472
Well, let's start with the truth.

23:26.974 --> 23:28.726
Did you breed Graboids?

23:28.809 --> 23:29.852
I did.

23:30.144 --> 23:32.730
Oh, God, Bill,
what have you done?

23:33.689 --> 23:35.733
Created a hunt like no other.

23:35.983 --> 23:39.778
You've imported an invasive species
onto a tropical island.

23:39.862 --> 23:40.988
You can't contain them.

23:41.071 --> 23:42.990
Calm down, Jas.
They're contained.

23:43.115 --> 23:44.492
They're not getting off that island.

23:44.825 --> 23:48.120
Besides, they'll all be dead
by Monday morning.

23:48.204 --> 23:49.788
- How many are there?
- Four.

23:50.539 --> 23:53.667
Three. I found a dead one
over there today.

23:54.126 --> 23:55.169
Did you?

24:00.883 --> 24:02.468
So we did kill it.

24:05.763 --> 24:07.806
You see, bio-tech's my day job.

24:08.390 --> 24:09.934
It's a shingle to hang on my door,

24:10.017 --> 24:13.270
but hunting, now that is my passion.

24:15.356 --> 24:17.775
It reminds me of my place
in the food chain,

24:17.858 --> 24:20.778
see, 'cause when you got wealth,

24:20.861 --> 24:23.656
the only currency worth a damn
is life and death.

24:23.739 --> 24:25.699
Shut this hunt down now.

24:28.202 --> 24:29.453
Yeah.

24:31.038 --> 24:32.373
I can't do that.

24:33.624 --> 24:35.084
Then I have no choice.

24:35.167 --> 24:38.504
I'm gonna have to report you
to the World Wildlife Federation.

24:38.587 --> 24:40.297
Well, that seems a bit rash.

24:40.381 --> 24:42.132
Well, maybe it is.

24:43.008 --> 24:45.261
I just can't believe
you've done this, Bill.

24:45.761 --> 24:46.762
I understand.

24:46.846 --> 24:48.681
You gotta do what you gotta do,

24:48.764 --> 24:52.768
but you should know
I jammed the comms grid for the weekend.

24:53.519 --> 24:55.229
No one ruins my hunt.

24:56.814 --> 24:58.649
I thought we were friends.

24:59.024 --> 25:02.570
You see this whiskey?
It's a 50-year-old Balvenie.

25:02.653 --> 25:04.488
It costs 50 grand a bottle.

25:06.490 --> 25:07.950
Now I offered you a glass,

25:09.535 --> 25:11.287
and I'm offering again.

25:12.621 --> 25:13.831
To me,

25:14.957 --> 25:16.834
that's what friendship looks like.

25:27.052 --> 25:28.846
To me, it's just whiskey.

29:06.272 --> 29:10.442
Jesus. These hunting scouts are savages.

29:11.235 --> 29:12.486
Board this up.

29:14.655 --> 29:15.781
Pretty Boy's gone.

29:16.532 --> 29:19.702
He probably just got drunk
and shacked up with an island chick.

29:49.273 --> 29:53.068
Looks like someone needs a shave.
And a haircut.

30:01.202 --> 30:02.203
Jasmine.

30:02.286 --> 30:04.079
I go by "Jas" now.

30:04.622 --> 30:06.832
Or Dr. Welker, whichever you prefer.

30:07.208 --> 30:09.543
I prefer none of the above.
What's she doing here?

30:09.835 --> 30:12.546
R&D for Avex-Bio.

30:13.130 --> 30:14.298
I sent for you.

30:16.592 --> 30:18.594
Why the hell did I come here?
I was perfectly happy.

30:19.053 --> 30:21.972
Burt, talk to me. We're adults.

30:22.056 --> 30:24.808
You want to talk? Here it is.

30:24.892 --> 30:27.895
I'm taking this boat back
to my life of total isolation.

30:27.978 --> 30:29.104
Please, Burt, don't go.

30:30.439 --> 30:31.982
It's been a long time.

30:33.025 --> 30:35.319
I know Travis was a shock, but...

30:35.402 --> 30:38.030
I don't want to hear
about him or you or me.

30:40.157 --> 30:41.158
Okay.

30:42.868 --> 30:48.332
Let's talk about Graboids,
or more specifically, how to kill them.

30:51.794 --> 30:52.795
Okay.

30:53.254 --> 30:59.009
Henceforth, we will limit
our conversation to Precambrian lifeforms,

30:59.093 --> 31:01.178
understood, Dr. Welker?

31:01.971 --> 31:04.515
Okay, hold on.
You guys are melting my brain.

31:04.598 --> 31:07.601
You two used to be, like, like a thing?

31:12.523 --> 31:15.401
<i>My name is Burt Gummer,
and I've been called many things.</i>

31:15.484 --> 31:18.821
<i>Gun enthusiast, monster hunter,
doomsday prepper.</i>

31:19.280 --> 31:20.781
<i>I reject all these labels.</i>

31:20.865 --> 31:23.200
<i>What I am is a survivalist.</i>

31:23.284 --> 31:25.661
<i>I've scoured the dirt and dust
of Nevada and Mexico,</i>

31:25.744 --> 31:27.621
<i>putting my life on the line to hunt</i>

31:27.705 --> 31:31.542
<i>supersized subterranean
man-eating predators called Graboids.</i>

31:31.625 --> 31:33.335
<i>Using a combination
of local knowledge, intuition...</i>

31:33.419 --> 31:34.503
Frigging awesome.

31:40.968 --> 31:42.887
Civilization comes calling.

31:44.096 --> 31:45.598
Whether I like it or not.

31:47.349 --> 31:50.144
<i>The Graboid is
a vicious subterranean predator</i>

31:50.227 --> 31:53.397
<i>about 30 feet in length
with a semi-rigid internal structure.</i>

31:53.480 --> 31:59.320
<i>It senses its prey seismically and employs
three powerful snake-like oral tentacles</i>

31:59.403 --> 32:00.696
<i>to ensnare its prey...</i>

32:06.619 --> 32:08.245
A little too close that time.

32:08.537 --> 32:10.289
<i>If that weren't enough,
Graboids give birth to</i>

32:10.372 --> 32:12.541
<i>three ugly spawn we call Shriekers,</i>

32:12.625 --> 32:15.711
<i>short, squat and blind,
bipedal bad boys</i>

32:15.794 --> 32:18.714
<i>that sense and hunt their prey
using infrared sensors.</i>

32:19.131 --> 32:20.716
This guy can't be for real.

32:20.799 --> 32:22.885
- Trust me, he's for real.
- <i>...a winged predatory...</i>

32:22.968 --> 32:24.678
Yeah, are you guys kidding me?

32:25.095 --> 32:29.225
Burt Gummer? He pulls major respect.
He's a freaking legend.

32:29.517 --> 32:32.937
If I looked half that good,
I'd shave my ass and walk backwards.

32:33.020 --> 32:34.813
He looks
more badass with the beard, though.

32:34.897 --> 32:35.981
I like his face.

32:36.273 --> 32:38.818
Ow! That's the dome
I know and love.

32:39.109 --> 32:43.572
<i>And remember,
life and survival starts here.</i>

32:45.074 --> 32:47.159
<i>Is that a rubber snake?</i>

32:53.958 --> 32:55.334
This your idea of privacy?

32:55.417 --> 32:57.753
It's the jungle, Burt.
Get over it.

32:58.420 --> 33:00.673
The boys pitched in
and got you some clothes.

33:00.756 --> 33:05.344
Cargo pants, khaki safari shirt,
standard jungle issue.

33:05.845 --> 33:08.514
It's clean, kind of. Anything else?

33:09.014 --> 33:10.391
Give it here.

33:14.144 --> 33:15.688
Whoa.

33:16.230 --> 33:17.690
Damn, Burt.

33:17.773 --> 33:20.818
The miles look better
on you than my backside.

33:20.901 --> 33:24.697
I don't need to know about your...
Your miles.

33:25.781 --> 33:29.827
Okay. Do you want to know
about our son, Travis?

33:30.286 --> 33:32.288
If we must. He's MIA again.

33:32.580 --> 33:36.709
He's behind bars for bringing
magic mushrooms across the Mexican border.

33:37.001 --> 33:39.003
Peyote, is that even still a thing?

33:39.086 --> 33:41.046
Everything old is new, Burt.

33:42.214 --> 33:46.135
Must've gotten his taste for psychedelics
from the shallow end of your gene pool.

33:46.218 --> 33:47.344
Come on.

33:48.220 --> 33:49.930
The team are waiting for a sit rep.

33:50.890 --> 33:52.099
<i>So, to recap,</i>

33:52.183 --> 33:55.769
there's one KIA
on an uninhabited volcanic island,

33:55.853 --> 33:57.438
and you think your boss,

33:57.897 --> 34:00.733
who happens to run
an international biotech company,

34:00.941 --> 34:04.111
has managed to obtain
and illegally gestate

34:04.528 --> 34:06.363
dormant Graboid eggs.

34:06.447 --> 34:07.990
Test-tube Graboids.

34:08.866 --> 34:10.117
This is folly!

34:10.201 --> 34:12.077
You know, it does seem
kind of folly-ish.

34:12.161 --> 34:13.579
It's not folly, Burt.

34:14.538 --> 34:16.539
The only access
to this island is by sea?

34:16.623 --> 34:19.376
Someone ripped
the HF radios out of the long-tail boat.

34:19.460 --> 34:22.003
Bill cut us off
until his hunt is over.

34:22.087 --> 34:23.797
I was told
I had an interloper.

34:27.050 --> 34:30.054
Bill Davidson. Billionaire philanthropist

34:30.179 --> 34:32.306
and a hunter of all things exotic.

34:32.597 --> 34:33.849
Burt Gummer.

34:34.391 --> 34:36.518
What brings you to my island paradise?

34:37.478 --> 34:39.063
Visiting a friend.

34:39.355 --> 34:42.273
Hey, nice Weatherby 308.

34:42.358 --> 34:45.735
I see you've installed
a biometric fingerprint trigger lock.

34:45.820 --> 34:48.947
Safety first.
It's required tech on all my hunts.

34:49.114 --> 34:52.367
Ah, your hunts.
Yes, yes. About that.

34:52.451 --> 34:54.453
If you've got Graboids
loose on your private island,

34:54.536 --> 34:56.996
you need to shut down
and create a perimeter

34:57.081 --> 35:01.210
we can defend so the native population
on this island doesn't get eaten alive.

35:01.293 --> 35:02.711
Well, like I told Jas,

35:03.045 --> 35:05.381
that island's a natural containment zone.

35:06.131 --> 35:07.758
Alcatraz for Graboids?

35:12.054 --> 35:13.138
Oh...

35:14.849 --> 35:17.059
That's catchy. I like it.

35:18.269 --> 35:20.271
Don't you worry
your little head, Burt.

35:20.354 --> 35:23.607
I'll have those bad boys
dressed and mounted by Monday morning.

35:23.691 --> 35:26.694
Before you begin
your Graboid-slaying quest,

35:26.777 --> 35:29.029
do yourself a favor
and get something bigger than that 308.

35:29.113 --> 35:31.407
That's like spitting at Godzilla.

35:43.127 --> 35:44.920
Damn, you're a funny man, Burt.

35:48.132 --> 35:50.551
You're gonna
behave yourself on my island, right?

35:54.346 --> 35:56.307
- I'll catch y'all later.
- Hmm.

35:58.350 --> 35:59.351
Have fun.

36:02.396 --> 36:04.899
That ass-clown's a skid mark
on our collective underwear.

36:05.900 --> 36:06.984
Tell me about it.

36:08.444 --> 36:11.572
I need to do recon,
see what we're up against.

36:11.655 --> 36:15.242
Now we need to organize
an expedition team. Get geared up!

36:15.326 --> 36:16.327
Count me in.

36:16.410 --> 36:17.411
Geared up?

36:17.495 --> 36:19.747
Yeah, weapons. Big ones.

36:20.080 --> 36:22.791
The full battle rattle.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.335
We don't have any munitions.

36:24.418 --> 36:25.836
Well, that's not entirely true.

36:25.920 --> 36:29.173
I mean, we got a couple sharp objects,
some odds and ends.

36:30.216 --> 36:31.300
Odds?

36:34.386 --> 36:37.848
We're completely gun-less?

36:39.767 --> 36:42.019
Uh...

36:42.478 --> 36:44.522
Well, let me show you
what we got.

36:44.897 --> 36:47.525
This is a bomb shelter
from World War II.

36:47.608 --> 36:50.986
Now we just use it
to store our dry goods and food supplies.

36:51.070 --> 36:53.030
A couple team members
think it's haunted,

36:53.113 --> 36:54.824
but I think it was
just a monkey giving birth.

36:56.575 --> 36:57.576
Down here.

37:00.830 --> 37:02.331
Watch your step.

37:09.088 --> 37:11.924
All right, take a gander.
This is what we got.

37:12.007 --> 37:13.759
When we first started
setting up camp here,

37:13.843 --> 37:14.844
I found all this stuff.

37:14.927 --> 37:19.515
We have knives, obviously,
and some machetes. Lots of machetes.

37:20.683 --> 37:23.060
Lord, be praised. Machetes, huh?

37:23.894 --> 37:26.564
Bless my soul, Pennsylvania steel.

37:27.439 --> 37:28.440
That supposed to be good?

37:28.524 --> 37:29.525
Does a bear shit in the woods

37:29.692 --> 37:31.902
and wipe its ass with a white rabbit?

37:33.237 --> 37:35.656
M2 flamethrower used by the US Marines

37:35.739 --> 37:38.993
in the island-hopping campaigns
of the Pacific Theater.

37:39.076 --> 37:41.203
Effective range, 20 to 40 meters.

37:41.495 --> 37:44.081
{\an8}We also have lots and lots
of crates of dynamite.

37:44.165 --> 37:45.332
{\an8}What, from the 1940s?

37:45.583 --> 37:46.584
{\an8}Yeah, I think so.

37:46.667 --> 37:47.835
Is it sweating?

37:47.918 --> 37:48.919
Dynamite sweats?

37:49.003 --> 37:52.590
Dynamite improperly stored sweats
its main ingredient, nitroglycerine.

37:52.673 --> 37:56.594
Yeah, which causes it to be highly,
and I mean highly, unstable.

37:56.844 --> 37:59.096
Even the slightest vibration
could set it off.

37:59.180 --> 38:01.265
{\an8}Which could actually
work to our advantage.

38:01.348 --> 38:02.349
Explain yourself.

38:02.433 --> 38:06.061
Me and my crew could turn this TNT
into a Graboid-activated tripwire.

38:06.145 --> 38:09.398
What, an anti-infiltration system?

38:09.481 --> 38:12.985
You got it. We'll turn
this whole camp into an area of denial.

38:13.068 --> 38:15.279
A couple of crash-bangs
won't stop a Graboid.

38:15.362 --> 38:19.116
Oh, but it'll slow it down.
Or at least let us know that she's coming.

38:19.992 --> 38:21.535
All right, can you and your team
handle this?

38:21.619 --> 38:24.747
Oh, we can make a helicopter
out of bamboo and bubblegum if you want.

38:24.997 --> 38:26.582
All right. Get to it.

38:26.665 --> 38:28.167
Bang it is, Mr. Gummer.

38:28.501 --> 38:31.212
We'll start by running the firing wire
and rigging the clackers.

38:31.295 --> 38:32.796
- Got it.
- That's dangerous work.

38:32.880 --> 38:35.925
I was born on a weed plantation
in Alder Point, California.

38:36.008 --> 38:37.009
Murder Mountain?

38:37.092 --> 38:40.012
Had a rifle in my hand
and a knife on my hip since I was seven.

38:40.471 --> 38:41.889
Made Eagle Scouts at 12.

38:42.598 --> 38:44.767
I'm not some tree-hugging vegan chick.

38:45.059 --> 38:46.602
I eat what I kill.

38:46.977 --> 38:48.979
I've killed some serious shit, Mr. Gummer.

38:49.730 --> 38:50.981
I could handle this.

38:54.443 --> 38:55.528
She knows her stuff.

38:56.821 --> 38:58.239
Wanna make yourself useful?

38:59.532 --> 39:01.283
I could use a pair of shades.

39:01.992 --> 39:03.202
All right.

39:04.703 --> 39:06.080
But I want them back.

40:08.392 --> 40:09.810
What the hell was that?

40:11.645 --> 40:13.230
Monkeys, I think.

40:16.108 --> 40:18.986
Anna, I want this Graboid
on my office wall.

40:21.280 --> 40:23.282
You better sober up, then, slick.

40:44.553 --> 40:45.846
Hello? Hello? Testing.

40:48.891 --> 40:52.186
Yo, Iris! Here you go.

40:53.938 --> 40:56.815
Hey, Mr. Gummer.
Do you have any sage advice?

40:58.025 --> 40:59.693
For starters, don't do that.

40:59.777 --> 41:00.861
Yeah, got it.

41:02.446 --> 41:04.990
So, uh, what is Jas to you?

41:05.449 --> 41:07.076
She's not an "is,"she's a "was."

41:08.118 --> 41:10.871
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I got me a few of those.

41:10.955 --> 41:12.790
I don't get women. Too many moving parts.

41:12.873 --> 41:16.335
I can take apartand reassemble
an AK-47 blindfolded, but women,

41:17.461 --> 41:19.421
they always want to talk about stuff.

41:20.256 --> 41:21.674
Yeah. Talking is tough.

41:21.757 --> 41:22.883
I thought you could use
one of these.

41:24.218 --> 41:25.594
What?

41:25.678 --> 41:27.221
A bird?

41:27.304 --> 41:29.014
It's your canary in the coal mine.

41:29.098 --> 41:31.100
She'll sense danger
and let you know it's coming.

41:31.183 --> 41:33.769
Hey, a living, breathing Graboid alarm.

41:33.853 --> 41:34.979
You got it!

41:35.062 --> 41:37.439
Yeah. I thought
You didn't have any guns around here?

41:37.523 --> 41:39.859
It's not really a gun.
It's a dart rifle.

41:39.942 --> 41:43.946
It fires a satellite-linked tag
with about a 72-hour battery life.

41:44.029 --> 41:46.448
So, we might tag one of those things,
so we could track it down.

41:46.532 --> 41:47.825
Good thinking.

42:01.172 --> 42:02.965
Almost there, gentlemen.

42:39.502 --> 42:40.753
Damn mozzies!

42:56.977 --> 42:58.312
One sec.

42:58.395 --> 42:59.438
Come on, keep up.

43:01.148 --> 43:02.691
You can't handle your liquor?

43:13.869 --> 43:16.413
I got this. I got this.

43:16.497 --> 43:18.666
I can do this. I can do this.

43:25.881 --> 43:27.049
Oh, man.

43:27.341 --> 43:30.469
I got a serious case
of swamp-ass going on here.

43:33.347 --> 43:34.682
What was that?

44:09.049 --> 44:10.092
Whoa.

44:23.647 --> 44:24.732
Let's go.

44:26.859 --> 44:29.361
Mandible range, two meters.

44:30.362 --> 44:32.865
I haven't seen one
of these bastards in over 20 years.

44:32.948 --> 44:34.158
What bastards?

44:34.700 --> 44:38.412
I assumed the unpredictable nature
of the evolutionary lifecycle

44:38.496 --> 44:41.040
had skipped this etymologic stage.

44:41.540 --> 44:43.834
If three came out,
we could be up against nine.

44:43.918 --> 44:45.461
They breed like freaking rabbits.

44:45.836 --> 44:47.213
They reproduce asexually?

44:47.296 --> 44:48.380
That's no fun.

44:49.089 --> 44:50.758
Yeah, and they need
access to protein.

44:50.841 --> 44:52.551
After two to five days
of gorging themselves,

44:52.635 --> 44:55.596
they molt into their winged brethren,

44:55.679 --> 44:58.015
the AssBlasters,
which is not, I repeat,

44:58.974 --> 45:00.476
not good news for us.

45:00.935 --> 45:03.229
Once they become airborne,
no place is safe.

45:04.188 --> 45:07.149
Okay, so we have
approximately 48 hours

45:07.233 --> 45:11.195
to stop these things
before they molt and spread like a virus?

45:11.529 --> 45:14.281
No. A viral pandemic.

45:14.365 --> 45:17.284
Well, good to know,
but what exactly are we talking about?

45:19.203 --> 45:20.412
Shriekers.

45:40.432 --> 45:42.184
A Graboid didn't do this.

45:42.434 --> 45:45.396
No, this is something else.

45:45.479 --> 45:48.607
<i>They're ambush hunters.
They make a loud screeching sound</i>

45:48.691 --> 45:51.235
just before they attack,
ergo the name.

45:56.657 --> 46:00.578
A large, bony frill on their head
is like an infrared camera of sorts.

46:03.497 --> 46:04.874
They hunt by heat signature?

46:06.000 --> 46:07.084
Like <i>Predator.</i>

46:13.257 --> 46:16.343
This is real life, son,
not some Hollywood fairytale.

46:17.595 --> 46:18.596
Okay.

46:19.346 --> 46:20.431
Move out!

46:51.295 --> 46:52.713
What the hell is that?

46:53.797 --> 46:55.174
Bioacoustics.

46:56.425 --> 46:58.093
They're speaking to each other.

46:58.385 --> 47:01.347
Yes, but what the hell is it?

47:03.307 --> 47:06.644
Hey, we have lost Wall Street, Bill.
He was right behind me.

47:07.019 --> 47:10.105
If you're gonna piss like a puppy,
you better stay on the porch.

47:58.863 --> 47:59.864
Ah, shit.

48:01.282 --> 48:02.449
Holy shit.

48:26.765 --> 48:28.017
This way.

48:28.851 --> 48:30.561
Wait, the bird told you that?

48:30.644 --> 48:31.770
Shut up and follow.

49:31.622 --> 49:32.748
Oh.

49:39.004 --> 49:41.257
I count three
Shriekers still on the run.

49:46.720 --> 49:51.350
Don't move!
We've got a Graboid. Everyone stay still.

49:51.767 --> 49:54.061
- What the hell did this?
- Shriekers.

49:54.186 --> 49:56.522
Yeah.
But this new version uses

49:56.605 --> 49:58.482
their bioacoustics as a weapon.

49:58.566 --> 50:00.067
Behavioral mutation.

50:01.694 --> 50:04.280
Everyone stay still.

50:10.119 --> 50:12.663
This son of a bitch
is dug in like a grizzly in December.

50:12.955 --> 50:15.207
Thanks for the save,
Gummer, but we're losing the light.

50:15.291 --> 50:17.376
We're gonna head back
to a defensive position.

50:17.459 --> 50:20.921
Don't move! We're right
in its wheelhouse. Look at that.

50:21.005 --> 50:23.382
Dead trees, soft, sallow ground.

50:23.883 --> 50:25.467
The formic acid they use to eat

50:25.551 --> 50:27.803
through this earth
has soured this whole area.

50:27.887 --> 50:31.223
It's like one giant Graboid playpen.

50:34.101 --> 50:35.644
How many did you hatch?

50:36.020 --> 50:37.438
Four. One's dead.

50:39.106 --> 50:40.107
Are they juiced?

50:40.191 --> 50:42.526
We used stem cell technology
and genomic editing

50:42.610 --> 50:44.361
to improve their predatory kill instincts.

50:46.155 --> 50:48.199
If we make it out of here alive,

50:48.282 --> 50:51.285
I'm gonna open up
an extra-large can of whoop ass on you!

50:53.370 --> 50:54.705
All right, I'm gonna distract it,

50:54.788 --> 50:56.749
and you all go at once
in different directions.

50:56.832 --> 50:58.417
- Copy.
- They can only get us one at a time.

50:58.501 --> 51:00.169
You any good with that Glock?

51:00.252 --> 51:01.378
Give me a target, I'll hit it.

51:01.462 --> 51:05.007
Okay. I'm gonna toss
this flamethrower as far as I can.

51:05.424 --> 51:07.510
When it lands, shoot the small tank.

51:07.593 --> 51:09.553
- That's where the nitrogen is stored.
- Got it.

51:11.263 --> 51:12.264
Run!

51:16.393 --> 51:17.394
Jesus.

51:17.478 --> 51:20.314
Oh, this shy lady
doesn't want to show her face.

51:20.397 --> 51:21.732
Come on, let's get the hell out of here!

51:22.149 --> 51:24.610
All right, bon appetit, bitch!

52:29.884 --> 52:31.343
How was the hunting party?

52:31.427 --> 52:32.511
Busy.

52:32.595 --> 52:34.388
You got a GPS dart into something.

52:34.555 --> 52:35.598
Yeah, I did.

52:35.681 --> 52:37.516
Well, we've been tracking
whatever it was.

52:37.600 --> 52:39.643
All right. Shriekers are pack hunters.

52:39.727 --> 52:41.729
If you're tracking one,
we're tracking the pack.

52:42.021 --> 52:45.608
I hate to be a fly
in the buttermilk, but remember Charlie?

52:45.691 --> 52:46.734
Who the hell's Charlie?

52:46.817 --> 52:49.361
Charlie. He's our
11,000-pound bull elephant

52:49.445 --> 52:50.863
we GPS tagged last month.

52:50.946 --> 52:54.700
Well, his GPS just refreshed.
He's 1,000 meters from our camp.

52:55.034 --> 52:57.536
Charlie's reading is subsurface.

52:57.786 --> 52:59.830
He's 37 meters down.

52:59.914 --> 53:02.208
And he's here?
He's not on Dark Island?

53:02.291 --> 53:04.919
Yep. I did a 3D scan of the mass.

53:05.002 --> 53:07.963
It's 19 meters long
and weighs over 20 tons.

53:09.340 --> 53:13.385
No, it can't be. No, no, no.
Graboids aren't that big. They don't swim.

53:13.636 --> 53:15.429
- You sure about that?
- It's impossible.

53:15.513 --> 53:19.475
One of those Graboids got off Dark Island
and made its way over here.

53:19.600 --> 53:21.977
And ate an 11,000-pound elephant?

53:22.228 --> 53:25.981
And it's 1,000 meters
due east of our outpost.

53:26.857 --> 53:28.859
Hold on, that's Bill's camp.

53:28.943 --> 53:32.738
Look, we need to get up to the outpost
and install that perimeter tripwire.

53:32.822 --> 53:34.740
That won't be necessary.

53:35.115 --> 53:36.158
Well, I'm afraid it is, Bill,

53:36.283 --> 53:39.203
because not only are we up
against two more juiced Graboids,

53:39.286 --> 53:41.247
but your stupidity
has spawned

53:41.789 --> 53:43.290
Shriekers.
That's what killed your men today.

53:43.833 --> 53:45.626
Yeah, it was a tough hunt.

53:45.960 --> 53:47.878
It's a good thing
they all signed waivers.

53:48.587 --> 53:50.589
Are you hearing me?
This hunt has got to stop.

53:50.673 --> 53:52.258
No, it doesn't, and it won't.

53:52.716 --> 53:54.301
See, I never leave a hunt half done.

53:54.385 --> 53:56.387
I'm taking those trophy mounts,

53:56.554 --> 53:57.888
and no one's gonna stop me.

53:58.347 --> 53:59.682
You don't know what you're up against.

53:59.807 --> 54:03.269
I think I do.
And I'm asking you kindly,

54:03.561 --> 54:05.145
step back and let me do what I do.

54:07.648 --> 54:08.649
I can't.

54:08.899 --> 54:09.900
Huh.

54:10.651 --> 54:11.652
Yeah.

54:12.611 --> 54:14.655
I kind of thought
you were gonna say that.

54:15.197 --> 54:17.616
Well, I guess we're
at an impasse, huh?

54:19.410 --> 54:21.996
See? This is the trouble
with not having guns.

54:22.371 --> 54:24.832
A word of advice,
Bill, stand down.

54:24.915 --> 54:27.376
You shit the bed
and you need me to clean it up.

54:27.459 --> 54:28.836
I got this handled.

54:28.919 --> 54:30.129
I'll tell you what you got.

54:30.212 --> 54:33.507
You got a genetically enhanced
giant carnivorous worm

54:33.591 --> 54:36.969
with tunneling abilities
that puts Bugs Bunny to shame.

54:37.052 --> 54:39.889
Now it escaped your contained island,
made its way here,

54:39.972 --> 54:41.974
and judging by your performance today,

54:42.057 --> 54:43.893
I don't think
you have the know-how to put it down.

54:44.435 --> 54:47.897
Don't do this, Bill.
You'll be up way past your bedtime.

54:57.490 --> 54:58.782
Night, Burt.

55:30.356 --> 55:33.108
Bill, we might've stepped
in the shit this time.

55:33.526 --> 55:36.612
We shouldn't have hatched
these things, let alone juiced them.

55:37.446 --> 55:39.114
This species should be left to die.

55:39.198 --> 55:40.199
Take it easy, man.

55:40.282 --> 55:43.577
It's R&D gone bad. Very bad.

55:43.661 --> 55:45.996
Hunting's a brutal sport, my friend.

55:48.958 --> 55:51.210
You know, there's actually
a Burt Gummer Day.

55:51.293 --> 55:54.630
You know,
like Labor Day or Memorial Day.

55:54.713 --> 55:58.801
He's not just a legend,
he's a superhero in some circles.

55:58.884 --> 56:01.095
He's a paranoid militant
with more guns

56:01.178 --> 56:03.430
and ammo than any sane
person should have.

56:27.621 --> 56:28.706
Hey, is he okay?

56:32.543 --> 56:34.336
I can't believe Bill roofied you.

56:34.420 --> 56:38.799
I believe it. And these zip-ties
are a boil on my backside.

56:39.091 --> 56:40.426
That's putting it mildly.

56:40.509 --> 56:41.635
We need a knife.

56:41.719 --> 56:43.262
Or a saw.

56:43.345 --> 56:46.765
Put a finer point on it,
we need a friction saw.

56:48.559 --> 56:50.311
A friction saw, huh?

56:50.603 --> 56:52.146
Yeah, you got one?

56:53.314 --> 56:54.648
No, but you do.

57:14.251 --> 57:15.628
She's here!

57:18.339 --> 57:19.757
You ugly bastard!

57:29.558 --> 57:33.103
Come on, come on, come on!

57:44.782 --> 57:46.075
Did we get it?

57:46.158 --> 57:48.828
I don't know.
Why don't you go out there and check, Doc?

57:51.205 --> 57:53.415
The boots you're wearing,
they're on loan from me.

57:53.624 --> 57:55.334
I'm not sure how this is relevant.

57:55.417 --> 57:56.502
Check the laces.

58:00.256 --> 58:01.590
550 paracord?

58:01.674 --> 58:03.926
Yes. 'Cause every smart prepper knows

58:04.093 --> 58:05.803
to be prepared for situations like this

58:05.886 --> 58:08.264
and switches
out his laces for 550 cord.

58:08.848 --> 58:10.307
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

58:35.791 --> 58:37.585
Pull the paracord tight
and move it back and forth.

58:37.668 --> 58:39.670
Okay, here we go.

58:41.714 --> 58:42.715
Does anybody see it?

58:50.764 --> 58:52.183
Where is it?

58:53.642 --> 58:55.769
Bloody hell, I don't have a visual!

58:55.853 --> 58:57.646
It's an underground creature,
you idiot.

59:00.441 --> 59:01.692
Where is it?

59:01.775 --> 59:03.319
Calm down, Doc.

59:04.987 --> 59:06.489
Richards, stop!

59:06.572 --> 59:07.948
Flare!

59:09.116 --> 59:11.327
You're a dead man running, Doc.

59:27.843 --> 59:29.053
Flare!

59:51.283 --> 59:53.702
Mother of God!

01:00:18.435 --> 01:00:19.436
That's it.

01:00:21.021 --> 01:00:22.064
Got it.

01:00:22.147 --> 01:00:24.817
Leadership skill number three, creativity.

01:00:25.025 --> 01:00:28.195
Finally, a hunt-worthy predator,
huh?

01:00:28.279 --> 01:00:30.906
What the hell, Bill? You've lost it.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.575
Did you see that thing?

01:00:32.658 --> 01:00:33.909
It's a masterpiece.

01:00:33.993 --> 01:00:35.369
I didn't sign up for this.

01:00:35.452 --> 01:00:37.121
You can't defect on me.

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:40.374
Pull yourself together, Bill,
and get out of this hunt.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.628
I can't do that, kiddo.

01:00:45.045 --> 01:00:46.422
Then I'm gone.

01:00:47.089 --> 01:00:48.090
Hey!

01:00:49.341 --> 01:00:53.512
Then leave your sidearm.
It's the property of Avex-Bio.

01:00:55.306 --> 01:00:56.432
Fine.

01:00:59.685 --> 01:01:00.895
Good luck, Bill.

01:01:00.978 --> 01:01:02.521
God knows you're gonna need it.

01:01:05.566 --> 01:01:07.026
I don't need luck.

01:01:08.527 --> 01:01:12.281
Hey, Bowtie, you ready for some fun?

01:01:19.455 --> 01:01:22.666
Well, we're in a real pickle.
We're locked in from the outside.

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:23.834
What?

01:01:41.185 --> 01:01:42.394
Mr. Gummer.

01:01:43.979 --> 01:01:45.481
Come to add salt to the wound?

01:01:45.564 --> 01:01:48.192
No. I've come to make peace.

01:01:48.275 --> 01:01:51.070
We just lost several
of our hunting party fighting that thing,

01:01:51.153 --> 01:01:55.115
including Dr. Richards,
and I'm afraid Bill's gone batshit crazy.

01:01:56.450 --> 01:02:00.371
So if you could use a spare set of hands,
I'd like to throw in.

01:02:02.832 --> 01:02:05.960
Come on, Burt.
They say it takes a village.

01:02:10.881 --> 01:02:12.466
No, it's gonna take an army.

01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:13.843
- An army?
- Yeah.

01:02:13.968 --> 01:02:16.303
I just met the queen,
and she's Godzilla-big.

01:02:16.387 --> 01:02:17.638
Okay, let's get out of here.

01:02:17.721 --> 01:02:19.431
No, we're way safer
in here than out there.

01:02:25.688 --> 01:02:27.481
You led her right to us!

01:02:27.565 --> 01:02:28.691
No, I came to help.

01:02:28.774 --> 01:02:29.942
It's okay, it's okay.

01:02:30.025 --> 01:02:31.986
This place was built
to withstand a nuclear attack.

01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:34.905
There's no way
that thing is getting in here. We're fine.

01:02:41.287 --> 01:02:42.496
You were saying?

01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:43.873
Crud.

01:02:43.956 --> 01:02:44.999
Oh, no.

01:02:52.047 --> 01:02:56.677
Wait.
Don't move. Not a sound.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:58.095
- Jas, don't.
- Okay.

01:03:05.895 --> 01:03:07.062
Shh.

01:03:17.781 --> 01:03:19.200
Somebody shut that thing off!

01:03:19.283 --> 01:03:21.118
If I kill the genny, we'll go dark.

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:24.872
That's okay.
Everybody get your cell phones out.

01:03:24.955 --> 01:03:25.956
Put your flashlights on.

01:03:26.707 --> 01:03:29.418
All right, kill it. Kill it.

01:03:49.271 --> 01:03:52.483
What? Give me a break.
My cell's at 0%.

01:03:53.317 --> 01:03:54.777
You have to be kidding me.

01:03:55.402 --> 01:03:58.906
The dynamite.
That's our ticket out of here.

01:03:59.281 --> 01:04:00.282
Good thinking.

01:04:00.366 --> 01:04:01.367
We'll fire up that genny,

01:04:01.450 --> 01:04:03.494
invite this bitch
in for some tea and dynamite,

01:04:03.577 --> 01:04:05.913
and blow the hell out
of this bomb shelter.

01:04:06.205 --> 01:04:08.207
I love the way
you think, bro.

01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:10.960
All right, we've got a plan.
Let's get on it pronto.

01:04:11.043 --> 01:04:12.127
Yeah.

01:04:14.171 --> 01:04:15.589
All right, hand it to me.

01:04:15.673 --> 01:04:16.674
Careful.

01:04:34.984 --> 01:04:36.318
Okay, I think that should do it.

01:04:36.402 --> 01:04:39.405
Okay, let's move towards the door.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:04:45.619 --> 01:04:46.662
Turn it on.

01:05:05.681 --> 01:05:06.891
Got a light?

01:05:08.726 --> 01:05:11.228
{\an8}- Go! Go, go, go!
- <i>Sayonara, muchacho!</i>

01:05:12.188 --> 01:05:13.480
{\an8}Go, go!

01:05:44.512 --> 01:05:48.599
Three dead Graboids.
Just one more between us and salvation.

01:05:48.682 --> 01:05:49.892
Don't forget about the Shriekers.

01:05:49.975 --> 01:05:51.727
Believe you me,
as far as Shriekers are concerned,

01:05:51.810 --> 01:05:53.020
I have a long memory.

01:05:53.103 --> 01:05:56.315
And the way they feasted
on Bill's hunters today,

01:05:56.398 --> 01:05:58.859
I'm sure there's
a whole litter of them by now.

01:06:04.365 --> 01:06:06.992
Hey, this is madness, Bill!

01:06:07.618 --> 01:06:11.580
Yes, it is.
Makes you feel alive, doesn't it?

01:06:16.794 --> 01:06:19.088
Maybe we just hole up, okay?

01:06:19.171 --> 01:06:20.840
And let the monster hunter handle it.

01:06:20.923 --> 01:06:24.260
You think holing up will keep
that creature from eating us alive?

01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:29.265
I don't know. Maybe not.

01:06:29.932 --> 01:06:34.895
Yeah? Lighten up, Bowtie.
Where's your sense of adventure, huh?

01:06:35.813 --> 01:06:39.066
I paid for a hunt. Not for this.

01:06:40.067 --> 01:06:42.570
And that, my friend,
is what I'm gonna give you.

01:06:42.653 --> 01:06:46.365
The hunt of your life.
Enjoy it. Hmm?

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.409
You're fricking crazy.

01:06:48.492 --> 01:06:52.746
Now grab your balls, and your rifle,

01:06:54.456 --> 01:06:56.250
and meet me
at the end of the bridge.

01:06:59.962 --> 01:07:02.715
We're gonna kill some Graboids, hmm?

01:07:22.026 --> 01:07:25.613
All right, we're just about
done setting up perimeter.

01:07:25.696 --> 01:07:29.658
Any of those things get in here,
we're gonna frag their asses.

01:07:31.327 --> 01:07:32.328
Sorry, what?

01:07:32.411 --> 01:07:34.330
I said, we're ready to frag
their frigging asses.

01:07:34.622 --> 01:07:36.081
Don't do that, Jimmy.

01:07:36.165 --> 01:07:37.208
Do what?

01:07:37.291 --> 01:07:39.418
Don't say things like,
"frag their frigging asses."

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:42.963
Burt Gummer can pull off that stuff,
but it's not a good look on you.

01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:44.381
Sage advice.

01:07:46.091 --> 01:07:47.384
- Excuse me, Mr. Gummer?
- Yep?

01:07:47.468 --> 01:07:49.762
I just did a recycle
on Charlie's GPS tag...

01:07:49.845 --> 01:07:51.096
The underground elephant?

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:54.558
Yeah, it seems like he's causing
a bit of trouble in Bill's camp.

01:07:54.642 --> 01:07:56.602
Effing Bill.

01:08:02.399 --> 01:08:05.110
You stay here and finish up.
I'll handle Bill.

01:08:17.915 --> 01:08:18.957
Help me!

01:08:20.292 --> 01:08:21.292
Help me!

01:08:28.509 --> 01:08:29.676
Help! Help!

01:08:42.397 --> 01:08:43.399
Shit.

01:08:53.366 --> 01:08:55.578
Welcome to the party, Burt.

01:08:56.245 --> 01:08:57.328
Hey, Bill.

01:08:57.412 --> 01:08:59.455
The survivalist survives.

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:02.500
So far, the Graboids are
the best damn hunters on this island.

01:09:02.585 --> 01:09:04.127
Holy hell, is it just you?

01:09:04.210 --> 01:09:05.879
It's just me and it.

01:09:05.962 --> 01:09:07.756
It's time for you
to come with me, huh?

01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:10.509
This creature's
an all-go, no-quit killing machine.

01:09:10.593 --> 01:09:12.051
It won't stop till it has you.

01:09:12.136 --> 01:09:14.596
You came all this way
to tell me what I already know?

01:09:14.679 --> 01:09:18.475
Turn the comms
back on and call for backup, huh?

01:09:18.558 --> 01:09:20.352
Just get out of here alive,
what do you say?

01:09:20.435 --> 01:09:21.770
I never lose.

01:09:22.604 --> 01:09:24.732
No one wins against these things. No one.

01:09:24.814 --> 01:09:26.024
You have.

01:09:26.107 --> 01:09:28.152
Not winning, just surviving.
I've been lucky.

01:09:28.234 --> 01:09:30.446
Now, come on, let's call it a day
and get you out of here.

01:09:30.529 --> 01:09:32.198
I'm gonna find it and kill it.

01:09:32.281 --> 01:09:34.116
Bill, don't be a damn fool. Come on!

01:09:35.116 --> 01:09:36.868
Come on, Bill!

01:09:37.036 --> 01:09:38.661
Would you listen to me? Come on,

01:09:38.953 --> 01:09:40.246
we can't stay here!

01:09:40.663 --> 01:09:42.249
I'm staying here.
I'm gonna win, Burt.

01:09:42.332 --> 01:09:44.084
- Just...
- I'm gonna win.

01:09:44.167 --> 01:09:46.377
No one wins.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:09:46.462 --> 01:09:48.129
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me, Burt.

01:09:48.214 --> 01:09:49.214
Bill... Bill, come on.

01:09:49.548 --> 01:09:50.591
I got this.

01:09:56.514 --> 01:09:58.057
Don't let go!
Don't let go!

01:10:02.311 --> 01:10:03.812
You son of a bitch!

01:10:09.443 --> 01:10:10.945
It's over.

01:10:11.987 --> 01:10:13.030
Come on!

01:10:13.113 --> 01:10:14.949
- It's got me...
- No chance.

01:10:28.254 --> 01:10:29.380
This has to end here.

01:10:30.381 --> 01:10:32.675
{\an8}Bill wasn't just a food source,
he was an enemy.

01:10:32.758 --> 01:10:35.261
That Graboid wanted him dead.

01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:38.222
Well, why didn't he come after you?
You're obviously the alpha.

01:10:38.514 --> 01:10:40.933
She's culling the weakest
from the herd first.

01:10:41.183 --> 01:10:43.143
Oh, crap.
That means I'm next.

01:10:43.227 --> 01:10:44.645
Now, look,
it's only a matter of time

01:10:44.728 --> 01:10:46.730
before the Graboid
works her way over here.

01:10:46.814 --> 01:10:49.108
Okay, so Bill and his weird science

01:10:49.191 --> 01:10:50.359
has opened the gates of hell here.

01:10:50.442 --> 01:10:52.778
We gotta put this place
in lockdown before those Shriekers

01:10:52.862 --> 01:10:54.572
get over here to help their leader.

01:10:54.655 --> 01:10:57.533
No, we've gotta eliminate
those Shriekers over on Dark Island

01:10:57.616 --> 01:11:00.536
before they morph into AssBlasters
and can go anywhere.

01:11:00.744 --> 01:11:03.330
Oh, hell. I need orientation.
Where the hell are we?

01:11:03.414 --> 01:11:04.665
Well, there's Bill's camp.

01:11:04.748 --> 01:11:06.876
- Wait, what's this?
- Devil's Punchbowl.

01:11:07.001 --> 01:11:09.503
It's an inactive caldera
from the Quaternary period

01:11:09.587 --> 01:11:11.505
about half a mile east up mountain.

01:11:11.589 --> 01:11:13.507
- Is that a plateau above it?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:11:13.674 --> 01:11:15.676
That looks like
a good place to end this fight.

01:11:15.759 --> 01:11:17.261
I love a good last stand.

01:11:18.179 --> 01:11:19.180
Well, why there?

01:11:19.263 --> 01:11:21.849
We lead it over the cliff
into the caldera and blow it to hell.

01:11:22.057 --> 01:11:24.977
It worked for Val and Earl 30 years ago,
it'll work for us.

01:11:25.227 --> 01:11:26.437
Wait, who's Val and Earl?

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.022
A couple of guys I used to know.

01:11:28.105 --> 01:11:32.526
Look, can you and your team
pre-rig the caldera with the TNT?

01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:33.903
Does a bear shit in the woods

01:11:34.028 --> 01:11:35.446
and wipe his ass with a white rabbit?

01:11:35.654 --> 01:11:37.114
Ooh!

01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:39.783
You guys are weird.
Just skip to the good part.

01:11:39.867 --> 01:11:42.995
Okay, so right now,
it's at 86 Fahrenheit.

01:11:43.078 --> 01:11:44.747
At noon, it'll be 100 plus.

01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:45.998
Why is that good?

01:11:46.081 --> 01:11:48.501
'Cause regular
human body temperature is 98.6.

01:11:48.584 --> 01:11:50.961
If the environmental
temperature exceeds that,

01:11:51.045 --> 01:11:53.088
then theoretically speaking,
the Shriekers' heat vision...

01:11:53.172 --> 01:11:57.384
...will be less effective
when it comes to warm-blooded mammals.

01:11:57.468 --> 01:11:58.719
Okay, they found shade.

01:11:58.802 --> 01:12:02.431
The satellite tag on the Shrieker
places them inside the sub-oceanic cave.

01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:06.560
Ah, I think we're gonna
have to split the team on this one.

01:12:06.644 --> 01:12:10.773
Burt, you and I should
ambush the Shriekers... Rambo style.

01:12:11.190 --> 01:12:14.902
All right, Jimmy and I will engage
the Shriekers in the cave.

01:12:15.027 --> 01:12:16.320
Oh, can I have the chainsaw?

01:12:16.403 --> 01:12:18.948
Fine, I'll keep the flame unit.
You ready for this?

01:12:19.031 --> 01:12:21.325
I am so ready! I think.

01:12:21.408 --> 01:12:25.329
Leadership skill number four,
courage and commitment.

01:12:30.835 --> 01:12:33.796
Okay, stay on
your walkie-talkie channel one.

01:12:33.879 --> 01:12:35.506
Channel one.

01:12:37.132 --> 01:12:38.425
Be careful over there.

01:12:38.509 --> 01:12:40.553
I don't have to be careful.
I'm prepared.

01:12:40.886 --> 01:12:42.054
Stop fussing.

01:12:42.471 --> 01:12:45.516
Listen, I'm sorry about...

01:12:45.599 --> 01:12:46.725
Oh, forget it.

01:12:46.851 --> 01:12:48.602
No. No, listen.

01:12:50.479 --> 01:12:52.898
It was wrong
not to share our son with you.

01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:55.484
I was young

01:12:57.069 --> 01:12:59.530
and I didn't want
you to feel trapped into something

01:12:59.613 --> 01:13:01.991
you weren't ready for or didn't want.

01:13:03.659 --> 01:13:04.660
Understatement.

01:13:04.743 --> 01:13:06.620
That's why I went it alone.

01:13:08.581 --> 01:13:10.457
We do the best we can with what we got.

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:13.752
I changed my mind.
I can't do this, Freddie. I can't.

01:13:14.128 --> 01:13:18.174
No, I wasn't raised on Murder Mountain,
growing weed or shooting squirrels.

01:13:18.257 --> 01:13:19.717
I was raised by a single mom.

01:13:19.967 --> 01:13:22.344
Excuse me.
Single moms are totally badass.

01:13:22.428 --> 01:13:26.432
Yeah, okay, maybe,
but I was a kid in the suburbs.

01:13:26.515 --> 01:13:30.728
My mom wears pink scrubs
with a little white toothy logo,

01:13:30.811 --> 01:13:32.605
and she's a dental hygienist.
I'm just a...

01:13:32.897 --> 01:13:35.191
<i>Callate,</i> okay? Don't say that.

01:13:35.274 --> 01:13:38.861
Don't let those negative self-loathing
thoughts leave your head again, all right?

01:13:39.361 --> 01:13:40.905
Do you mind if
I ask you a question?

01:13:41.238 --> 01:13:43.407
If I said no, would it matter?

01:13:45.034 --> 01:13:50.915
Does this "go it alone" thing
really work for you?

01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:56.962
I gotta go, Slim.

01:13:58.839 --> 01:14:01.800
Hey, don't lose those Ray-Bans.

01:14:04.386 --> 01:14:06.055
Hey, let's go, Ram-boy.

01:14:06.138 --> 01:14:07.640
You're the baddest man alive.

01:14:07.723 --> 01:14:11.227
And your mom,
she probably used that sharp tool...

01:14:13.229 --> 01:14:14.522
The scraper, the tooth, the...

01:14:14.605 --> 01:14:15.648
The plaque scraper.

01:14:15.731 --> 01:14:18.776
Yes, that. I bet you
she'd shove it up a Shrieker's ass

01:14:18.901 --> 01:14:20.528
if she had to, okay?

01:14:21.445 --> 01:14:25.616
Let's go, son! Move out!
You hold down the fort.

01:14:25.699 --> 01:14:27.201
Don't let that Graboid
give you any crap.

01:14:29.411 --> 01:14:30.871
Go get them, all right?

01:15:43.402 --> 01:15:45.404
Come on,
Ram-boy, let's go.

01:16:07.426 --> 01:16:08.928
This has gotta be the place.

01:16:11.305 --> 01:16:13.474
If three Shriekers
survived that last battle,

01:16:13.557 --> 01:16:16.393
we're gonna be up against
at least nine by now.

01:16:17.102 --> 01:16:18.646
Keep your eyes peeled,
Ram-boy.

01:16:19.063 --> 01:16:20.356
Copy that, Mr. Gummer.

01:16:23.734 --> 01:16:24.735
What the hell are you doing?

01:16:25.027 --> 01:16:27.279
Putting mud on me
like Arnold did in <i>Predator.</i>

01:16:27.363 --> 01:16:30.366
I mean, I don't want those creatures
seeing my heat signature.

01:16:31.283 --> 01:16:32.409
Come on, mud up.

01:16:32.993 --> 01:16:34.662
Not a terrible idea.

01:16:39.208 --> 01:16:42.211
What I wouldn't give
for a Mylar poncho right now.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:48.801
Okay.

01:16:59.603 --> 01:17:00.688
Movement.

01:17:00.771 --> 01:17:01.772
Where?

01:17:02.231 --> 01:17:03.357
Dead ahead.

01:17:07.194 --> 01:17:08.404
Where are they?

01:17:09.196 --> 01:17:11.657
Every blow you strike
has to be a kill shot.

01:17:12.408 --> 01:17:16.120
The underbelly is what you want.
Legs, feet, groin,

01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:18.706
all the soft stuff.

01:17:19.165 --> 01:17:20.875
Go for the groin. Got it.

01:17:21.292 --> 01:17:24.086
Let's go medieval
on these ugly slime bags.

01:17:24.378 --> 01:17:25.546
I thought we were going Rambo.

01:17:25.754 --> 01:17:26.755
Oh, uh...

01:17:26.839 --> 01:17:29.633
You go Rambo. I've got the chainsaw.
I'm going <i>Evil Dead.</i>

01:17:29.925 --> 01:17:30.968
You ready?

01:17:31.385 --> 01:17:33.429
Ready. Wait, wait.

01:17:33.512 --> 01:17:34.513
What?

01:17:34.597 --> 01:17:37.308
Ear protection. These guys use
sound as a weapon, remember?

01:17:37.391 --> 01:17:38.434
Right.

01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:48.319
Stay with me, boy! Come on!

01:17:49.653 --> 01:17:50.779
Let's do this.

01:17:58.454 --> 01:18:00.581
Mr. Gummer?
Don't get too far now.

01:19:30.171 --> 01:19:31.589
Don't you try!

01:20:02.828 --> 01:20:03.913
Hey, guys?

01:20:03.996 --> 01:20:05.122
<i>She's here.</i>

01:20:17.259 --> 01:20:19.261
Okay,
that wasn't too bad.

01:20:27.728 --> 01:20:28.729
All right.

01:20:31.273 --> 01:20:33.275
All right. Mr. Gumm...

01:21:02.555 --> 01:21:06.350
Get to high ground! I repeat,
get to high ground now!

01:21:42.219 --> 01:21:44.763
How you doing, Ram-boy?

01:21:46.098 --> 01:21:47.391
Suck on this!

01:21:50.644 --> 01:21:52.730
I'm loving this flame unit!

01:22:44.281 --> 01:22:47.827
Who needs guns
when you got Pennsylvania steel?

01:23:21.152 --> 01:23:22.278
Whoa!

01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:23.946
Whoa!

01:23:24.405 --> 01:23:27.074
We don't want to lose
that nice figure now, do we?

01:23:29.493 --> 01:23:32.705
No sign of our nemesis. It's quiet.

01:23:33.122 --> 01:23:35.624
Yeah, it's weirdly quiet.

01:23:41.005 --> 01:23:42.756
<i>Mr. Gummer,
it's Freddie. Over.</i>

01:23:43.048 --> 01:23:44.758
Hey, Freddie.
Go for Burt. Over.

01:23:44.842 --> 01:23:46.677
<i>Look up and to the left.</i>

01:23:50.264 --> 01:23:51.515
I'm gonna take a wild guess.

01:23:52.016 --> 01:23:53.642
Queen Graboid finally showed up?

01:23:53.851 --> 01:23:56.478
<i>Yes, she did,
and she's right underneath you.</i>

01:23:56.562 --> 01:24:00.858
<i>Twelve meters down.
I mean, right beneath you.</i>

01:24:01.942 --> 01:24:04.195
Where is everybody?
Is Jas all right?

01:24:04.278 --> 01:24:05.821
I thought you'd never ask.

01:24:06.405 --> 01:24:09.825
Don't move! Stay still.

01:24:10.326 --> 01:24:12.369
You shouldn't be here, Jas.

01:24:13.204 --> 01:24:14.622
I can handle myself.

01:24:16.665 --> 01:24:17.833
Where's Anna?

01:24:17.917 --> 01:24:20.252
<i>Water tower, Mr. Gummer.
All good up here.</i>

01:24:32.765 --> 01:24:36.560
What are you...
Jas, get him off the ground!

01:24:37.686 --> 01:24:40.231
You've been waiting for me,
haven't you?

01:24:47.822 --> 01:24:49.365
It's time, isn't it?

01:24:49.448 --> 01:24:52.409
Yeah. Devil's Punchbowl, is it ready?

01:24:52.493 --> 01:24:53.494
<i>More or less.</i>

01:24:53.702 --> 01:24:54.995
Make it ready now!

01:24:55.496 --> 01:24:58.541
<i>Copy that, Mr. Gummer.
See you there. Over.</i>

01:24:58.624 --> 01:25:01.752
Roger that.
Easy as you go. See you there shortly.

01:25:04.588 --> 01:25:06.674
So, uh, what now?

01:25:07.174 --> 01:25:09.844
You need to get out of here. Both of you.

01:25:10.094 --> 01:25:11.720
I'll meet you there. Go, now!

01:25:11.804 --> 01:25:15.474
Yeah. Wait,
isn't that thing gonna follow us?

01:25:15.558 --> 01:25:18.686
No, no.
That mother wants me.

01:25:20.938 --> 01:25:22.898
Now skedaddle. Go. Scat!

01:25:29.363 --> 01:25:31.824
You don't have to go it alone this time.

01:25:31.907 --> 01:25:33.033
I've got this, Slim.

01:25:34.577 --> 01:25:36.745
Yeah, but what happens if...

01:25:38.706 --> 01:25:39.707
If?

01:25:42.418 --> 01:25:43.794
That's one hell of an if.

01:25:45.254 --> 01:25:46.380
But if so,

01:25:47.047 --> 01:25:50.217
then you and that
ne'er-do-well son of ours stand to inherit

01:25:50.426 --> 01:25:53.637
2,000 gallons of petrol,
a five-year supply of water,

01:25:53.929 --> 01:25:55.347
3,000 MREs

01:25:55.514 --> 01:25:58.309
and enough munitions to blow
the State of Nevada to kingdom come.

01:25:58.684 --> 01:25:59.894
Nice portfolio.

01:26:00.352 --> 01:26:03.272
Oh, and you get
these sunglasses back.

01:26:03.564 --> 01:26:05.941
I'm sorry to interrupt
your last will and testament,

01:26:06.025 --> 01:26:07.193
but we gotta do this, Mr. Gummer.

01:26:07.276 --> 01:26:08.444
Affirmative.

01:26:08.777 --> 01:26:13.324
And whether you like it or not,
I'm coming with you.

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.242
That's a negative.

01:26:15.326 --> 01:26:17.369
- No.
- Now, you'll go with Jas,

01:26:17.453 --> 01:26:18.913
and we'll rendezvous
at the Devil's Punchbowl,

01:26:18.996 --> 01:26:21.081
now skedaddle.
Go, go, go. Come on.

01:26:39.975 --> 01:26:43.020
Okay, big guy.
Just you and me.

01:26:47.274 --> 01:26:49.151
<i>Mano-a-mano.</i>

01:27:01.038 --> 01:27:03.040
Destiny's a bitch.

01:29:09.124 --> 01:29:10.125
Time's up!

01:29:13.045 --> 01:29:14.880
- Mr. Gummer?
- You again?

01:29:14.964 --> 01:29:18.008
Yeah. So, what's the plan?

01:29:18.801 --> 01:29:20.469
The plan is to get her to charge us.

01:29:21.428 --> 01:29:24.056
We draw her to the edge
of the cliff and over.

01:29:24.139 --> 01:29:27.393
And then we lunge out of the way
at the last second?

01:29:27.476 --> 01:29:28.644
Something like that.

01:29:45.995 --> 01:29:47.163
This is it, Ram-boy.

01:29:48.122 --> 01:29:51.083
So lead, follow,
or get out of my way.

01:29:53.335 --> 01:29:54.336
Okay.

01:29:56.463 --> 01:29:57.464
I'll lead.

01:29:59.550 --> 01:30:00.551
That's not an option.

01:30:00.634 --> 01:30:02.553
Your options are to follow
or get out of the way.

01:30:03.179 --> 01:30:04.972
No, I'm faster.

01:30:05.055 --> 01:30:07.057
- I'm wiser.
- I'm younger.

01:30:07.141 --> 01:30:09.268
I... You got me there.

01:30:10.936 --> 01:30:13.606
Teamwork, then.
Can we settle on that?

01:30:45.888 --> 01:30:47.973
<i>Vaya con diablo, mija.</i>

01:32:57.019 --> 01:32:58.312
Mr. Gummer?

01:33:05.194 --> 01:33:06.570
Mr. Gummer?

01:33:10.699 --> 01:33:12.368
Mr. Gummer?

01:33:19.834 --> 01:33:21.252
Mr. Gummer?

01:33:31.387 --> 01:33:33.097
Mr. Gummer?

01:33:46.569 --> 01:33:47.903
Where is he?

01:33:48.571 --> 01:33:51.615
I don't know.
He was right next to me, and then...

01:33:52.158 --> 01:33:53.701
Mr. Gummer?

01:33:55.035 --> 01:33:57.580
Burt? Burt?

01:33:59.248 --> 01:34:00.583
Burt!

01:34:00.666 --> 01:34:01.876
Mr. Gummer!

01:34:40.831 --> 01:34:41.999
No.

01:37:08.694 --> 01:37:13.694
