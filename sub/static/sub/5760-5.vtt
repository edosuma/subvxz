00:08.800 --> 00:10.800
<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

00:12.800 --> 00:15.500
I just got married,
just moved to a small town,

00:15.700 --> 00:17.200
<i>just opened up an antique shop.</i>

00:17.400 --> 00:19.200
I might be just like you.

00:20.100 --> 00:22.200
Except from the time
that I was a little girl,

00:22.400 --> 00:24.200
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.800
It's all right, honey.

00:26.900 --> 00:28.900
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them,

00:29.100 --> 00:30.800
<i>the ones who have not crossed over</i>

00:31.000 --> 00:33.100
<i>because they have
unfinished business with the living.</i>

00:33.300 --> 00:35.400
<i>And they come to me for help.</i>

00:36.100 --> 00:39.100
To tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.500
Come on, it'll be a great chance
for us to break out,

00:45.600 --> 00:47.200
meet new people,
make new customers.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.900
You do not have to be the one

00:48.900 --> 00:50.900
standing up in front of,
like, a jillion strangers.

00:51.100 --> 00:54.200
You are gonna be great. Besides,
I set up, like, 50 auctions in the city.

00:54.500 --> 00:55.900
They're fun. Where's the light? Hello.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.500
Does all this junk have to come up?

00:57.700 --> 00:58.900
Yeah. Everything.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.700
Look, I could get a pro
to do the auction,

01:01.900 --> 01:03.300
but it's gonna cost us so much.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.300
And you're beautiful,
and everyone's gonna listen to you.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.500
Well, then how come you don't
listen to me when I tell you no?

01:07.700 --> 01:08.800
Oh, I'm listening to you.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I'm just not paying any attention.

01:10.100 --> 01:11.700
- There's a difference.
- You're funny.

01:11.900 --> 01:13.700
Well, I guess "auctioneer"
could be kind of a cool thing

01:13.900 --> 01:15.000
to have on my resume.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.900
Thank you. You're gonna love it.

01:17.100 --> 01:18.400
Cool.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.700
Creepy. Do you smell smoke?

01:24.100 --> 01:25.700
Yeah, it's probably the old furnace.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.200
What was that?

01:29.700 --> 01:30.900
Do you feel that?

01:32.400 --> 01:33.500
Oh, God. What is that?

01:33.600 --> 01:36.400
Rats. Oh, I hate rats.

01:40.600 --> 01:44.800
Okay. This will be me
calmly going back upstairs.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074

02:03.600 --> 02:05.300
I know you're there.

02:15.900 --> 02:18.000
This is our stuff. Leave it be.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.300
This is our stuff. Leave it be.

02:23.900 --> 02:25.000
Yeah.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.000
Who do you think you are?

02:27.100 --> 02:30.500
Now, get out of here
before we do something you don't like.

02:41.300 --> 02:42.900
<i>Can you see us?</i>

03:14.500 --> 03:16.000
Was it rats?

03:16.200 --> 03:17.400
No. Little boys.

03:17.500 --> 03:18.800
Ghost little boys?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Only two that I saw, and a dog.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.300
A dog? A ghost pet?

03:23.500 --> 03:25.200
Yeah. They want us out of here.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.100
- Works for me.
- No, I'm serious.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.100
And it looks like
they've been here for a long time.

03:29.300 --> 03:30.600
My grandma used to always say

03:30.800 --> 03:32.500
that if a child ghost
gets attached to a place,

03:32.700 --> 03:33.800
it's really hard to cross him over.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.100
What do you do if they won't leave?

03:35.300 --> 03:37.800
Well, it makes my job harder,
but I can't just leave them here.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.600
You know? They have to have
somebody waiting for them

03:39.800 --> 03:41.000
on the other side.
They're only children.

03:41.100 --> 03:43.500
Morning, ladies. How's it going?

03:43.700 --> 03:45.600
Oh, you know,
we're getting there. It's a lot of stuff.

03:45.800 --> 03:46.900
I don't believe we've met.

03:47.100 --> 03:50.300
No. No, I'm Andrea Moreno.
I'm Melinda's partner.

03:50.800 --> 03:51.900
Oh, Dirk Abrams,

03:52.100 --> 03:54.800
the last occupant of Kensington Arms.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.600
Mr Abrams is also the owner.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.600
Former owner, sorry to say.

03:59.100 --> 04:01.200
Oh, where did you find this?

04:01.400 --> 04:03.100
Oh, down in the basement.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.800
So, was it a hotel
back then as well, or...

04:06.000 --> 04:07.200
An orphanage.

04:07.300 --> 04:08.800
The inn was an orphanage?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
St. Michael's Home for Boys.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.400
Built in the '20s.

04:14.100 --> 04:16.800
Wow. This place has not changed a bit.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.899
Oh, it has.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.400
There was a bad fire in 1956.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.400
Destroyed half the place.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.900
Was anyone killed in the fire?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.200
Oh, several young boys.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.400
Very sad.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.600
It was a big story
around here for a long time.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.200
You know, Andrea,
why don't you show Mr Abrams

04:38.400 --> 04:40.800
everything that we've brought up so far,
and I'll be right there.

04:40.900 --> 04:42.100
Okay.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.100
Let's go take a look.

04:44.300 --> 04:45.600
All right.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.700
Oh, here you go.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.600
Okay.

05:10.100 --> 05:11.300
Okay.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.100
Rat wants to talk to you.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.200
And who's Rat?

05:23.300 --> 05:25.700
You'll find out. Follow me.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.800
You, come here.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.400
Excuse me?

05:44.400 --> 05:46.100
We got ourselves a problem here, lady.

05:46.300 --> 05:48.900
Let's try names. I'm Melinda.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.300
He's Rat. I'm Marty.

05:51.800 --> 05:55.500
And Vic is hiding somewhere.
That's what he does.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.600
- Who dialled your number?
- Sorry, Rat.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.300
How come you could see us?

05:59.500 --> 06:01.700
It's a gift I have.

06:01.900 --> 06:02.900
I was born with it.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.100
Some gift.

06:04.300 --> 06:07.200
And what makes you think you could
just walk out of here with our stuff?

06:07.400 --> 06:09.400
Well, it's not really your stuff.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.800
It belongs to Mr Abrams,
and he hired us to auction it off for him.

06:13.500 --> 06:17.600
Now, do you boys
understand why? Do you know...

06:17.800 --> 06:20.600
We know we're dead, lady.
We ain't stupid.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.100
- We are?
- Shut up!

06:25.200 --> 06:27.200
Look, we don't want no action.

06:27.600 --> 06:28.800
- Auction.
- Whatever.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.500
This is our house.
This is where we live,

06:30.700 --> 06:32.900
and that's our furniture,
and we want it back.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.600
Now, run along.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.600
Okay, you know what?
Let me explain something to you...

06:38.900 --> 06:40.600
Do I really need to call him Rat?

06:55.700 --> 06:56.800
Okay.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.500
Man, I wish I was there for that.

07:01.700 --> 07:04.500
Now, wait. How is it
they can make things explode again?

07:04.600 --> 07:06.100
They build up
so much energy over the years

07:06.300 --> 07:07.500
that they can get really powerful,

07:07.600 --> 07:10.700
- and then they break things.
- Great.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.900
Another fun fact from Melinda.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.400
All right, I'm gonna go back to the shop
with these guys and unload.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.800
- See you later.
- Meet you down there.

07:16.900 --> 07:18.200
Wait for me.

07:25.400 --> 07:28.500
Excuse me, young lady.
May I ask what you're doing?

07:28.600 --> 07:29.700
And you are?

07:29.900 --> 07:32.500
- This is my property.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.100
I'm Melinda Gordon.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.100
We're getting ready to have an auction.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.700
Tobias Northrop.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.000
Hello.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.200
Mr Abrams has told me a lot about you.

07:41.400 --> 07:44.800
He said that you saw this place on the
Internet and bought it over the phone.

07:45.300 --> 07:47.100
I wanted to check with Mr Abrams

07:47.300 --> 07:50.300
and make sure
he'll have everything out by Sunday.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.900
We're right on schedule.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.600
What are you gonna do with it?
Bed and breakfast?

07:54.800 --> 07:56.200
I'm going to tear it down.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.700
But why would you...

07:57.900 --> 07:59.600
Good day, Ms Gordon.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.900
Nice to meet you.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.000
Marty says you told him we were dead.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.100
You didn't know?

08:15.500 --> 08:17.000
Yeah. I knew.

08:17.900 --> 08:20.100
I mean, we never get hungry.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.600
We never sleep.

08:21.800 --> 08:22.900
Really?

08:23.200 --> 08:25.000
And nobody can see us.

08:25.900 --> 08:27.300
Except you.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.300
That's gotta be dead.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.299
Wow.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.200
You are very smart.

08:36.700 --> 08:37.700
Yeah.

08:39.299 --> 08:41.100
But I'm afraid of the dark.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.000
Me, too.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.000
Will you spend the night with us?

08:49.100 --> 08:50.200
What?

08:50.500 --> 08:53.200
Oh, sweetie, I don't think I can.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.900
I have to go home.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.200
Do you ever leave the inn?

09:00.400 --> 09:03.500
No. Rat says our feet will catch fire.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.600
Why would he say that?

09:05.900 --> 09:08.200
He's real smart about that kind of stuff.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.900
What did you say
your name was again?

09:11.700 --> 09:13.000
Vic.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.000
I wish I could help you.

09:17.100 --> 09:18.900
Nobody stays no more.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.700
They always just leave.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.100
- No.
- What?

09:27.200 --> 09:28.300
Lew Peterson?

09:28.500 --> 09:30.900
He's the only friend I have who
actually knows how to put a furnace in.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.400
But is he reliable?
You haven't seen him in months.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.500
Yeah, since our wedding.

09:36.900 --> 09:39.600
I know he's not exactly
a póster boy for good manners, but...

09:39.800 --> 09:41.000
- He's your friend.
- Yeah.

09:41.100 --> 09:43.300
And I respect that, and I wouldn't come
between the two of you,

09:43.500 --> 09:46.100
but let's face it.
He's rude and he's crude.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.000
He's an eighth-grader with a car.

09:48.100 --> 09:50.000
- He speaks well of you.
- He doesn't like me.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.600
He thinks I'm the Yoko Ono
of your friendship.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.100
You know, that I stole you
away from the bars and the nightlife.

09:55.300 --> 09:56.400
All right, all right, all right, look.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.400
I'll ask him to stay somewhere else
while we work on the house.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.100
You asked him to stay here?

10:00.200 --> 10:02.600
Look, now we're gonna have to
host him tonight and for the rest of...

10:02.800 --> 10:05.800
Actually, I was kind of
hoping that you would host him tonight.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.700
I got paged for the midnight
to 8:00 shift, and I've really...

10:08.900 --> 10:11.400
Well, in that case, there is something
that I have to do tonight

10:11.600 --> 10:13.000
that I forgot to tell you.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.400
Well, that's... It's a little extreme.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.000
Three little boys need my help.

10:19.100 --> 10:20.200
Dead boys?

10:20.400 --> 10:22.700
So, what, you're gonna spend the night
in a haunted house alone...

10:22.900 --> 10:23.900
The bush.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Yeah, your plant.
A haunted house alone?

10:26.200 --> 10:27.600
I feel like I'm in a John Carpenter film.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.000
You know what?
I will probably sleep better there

10:29.200 --> 10:31.400
than here with Party Boy, okay?

10:31.600 --> 10:33.000
And if the inn is destroyed
with them in it,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.200
they'll be earthbound forever.
And I'm not gonna be alone.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.200
Mr Abrams still has a room there.

10:37.400 --> 10:40.200
Oh, old Mr Abrams has a room there.
That makes me feel better.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.400
The guy could be a serial killer.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.300
It's safe, I promise.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.000
- You promise?
- I promise.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.500
Okay.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.800
Well, just keep thinking
about how much money we're saving

10:52.000 --> 10:53.500
with Lew helping me put in the furnace.

10:53.700 --> 10:56.800
Whatever it is, is not worth it.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.700
He's changed. You'll see.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.200
It's okay. He just grazed it.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.600
- Hey, Mel!
- Hey, Lew.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.100
You look great.

11:14.300 --> 11:15.600
You're too kind.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.200
Don't burn the house down.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.500
She's still pissed at me.

11:21.700 --> 11:24.200
Well, you did pass out
before the wedding even started.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.600
And now you just ran over
her favourite plant.

11:27.300 --> 11:28.400
My bad.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.800
Hello?

11:33.500 --> 11:34.800
Mr Abrams?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.500
It's Melinda Gordon.

11:42.800 --> 11:43.900
Hello?

11:47.100 --> 11:48.300
Working late?

11:48.400 --> 11:51.200
Hi. Mr Abrams,
I hope I didn't scare you.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.200
Just thought I'd spend the night

11:54.400 --> 11:56.200
and get an early start on tomorrow.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.400
You only live a mile up the road.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.900
Yeah, well, it is our first auction.

12:01.100 --> 12:03.600
You know, lot to prove.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.300
Well, whatever.

12:12.400 --> 12:15.400
Well, I met Mr Northrop before.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.200
Strange sort of man, isn't he?

12:19.600 --> 12:21.700
Did you tell him
that this used to be an orphanage?

12:21.900 --> 12:23.400
Nope. He never asked.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.700
And did you know
that he's planning to tear it down?

12:25.900 --> 12:28.200
He's got the demolition
scheduled for Monday.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.700
He does?

12:30.400 --> 12:32.700
I could really use that extra time.

12:33.400 --> 12:34.500
You could?

12:34.700 --> 12:37.400
Well, yeah, you know.
The extra time to convince him

12:37.600 --> 12:40.000
to not tear down this great old place.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.000
Thank you.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.500
Do you believe in ghosts,
Miss Gordon?

12:54.100 --> 12:55.500
Yes.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.200
I do.

12:57.400 --> 13:01.300
I think they're here now.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.900
They're all around.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.000
Yeah.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.300
I thought you boys wanted company.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.000
You guys have been practising
this stuff for a long time now, huh?

13:39.200 --> 13:40.400
Ain't much else to do.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.900
What are you doing here?

13:43.100 --> 13:46.100
I thought you asked... I mean,

13:47.100 --> 13:50.200
I know that you boys
are as tough as nails,

13:50.700 --> 13:51.800
especially you,

13:51.900 --> 13:54.100
and I thought maybe I could help.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.000
You wanna help us?
Then come downstairs.

13:58.700 --> 13:59.800
Okay.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.900
Right there. That's the book.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.900
Could you read it to us, please?

14:14.500 --> 14:17.700
<i>Peter Pan. That's our favourite.</i>

14:17.900 --> 14:19.100
Can you read?

14:19.300 --> 14:21.500
No. None of us can.

14:21.700 --> 14:24.400
Ernie could read.
He knew all of the words.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.800
Who's Ernie?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.700
He's a pal of ours.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.600
Is he here with you?

14:29.900 --> 14:33.000
No. Not for a long time.

14:37.400 --> 14:38.400
So,

14:39.700 --> 14:41.700
why don't you tell me about Rat

14:41.900 --> 14:43.400
and why he's so mad at everybody?

14:43.600 --> 14:45.200
He says you can't trust anybody.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.000
Well, he trusts you, doesn't he?

14:47.200 --> 14:48.300
Yeah, he does.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.200
And he trusted his brother.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.200
- He had a brother?
- Mikey.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.400
It was his little brother.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.200
How come no one ever adopted them?

14:56.300 --> 14:58.000
Somebody adopted Mikey.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.700
But they left Rat here.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.100
There was a lot of crying
when that happened.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.200
So he has a brother out there.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.700
He got drowned.

15:10.100 --> 15:12.100
Big wave hit him at the beach.

15:12.300 --> 15:14.600
That's when Rat said
we can only trust each other.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.900
So tell us the story about Peter Pan.

15:17.100 --> 15:20.100
That would be easier
if there was some light.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.800
You are very talented.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.400
Okay.

15:32.400 --> 15:35.000
"There was only one boy
who never grew up,

15:35.300 --> 15:37.500
"and his name was Peter Pan.

15:38.900 --> 15:41.400
"See him there,
floating over their beds?

15:42.400 --> 15:44.200
"He came in through the open window

15:44.400 --> 15:47.500
"while Wendy, Michael,
and John were sound asleep.

15:48.700 --> 15:51.100
"He taught them
to think happy thoughts

15:51.300 --> 15:53.600
"and sprinkled them
with pixie dust so they could..."

15:53.800 --> 15:56.000
- Fly.
- I know what you're trying to do.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.800
Trying to get us out of here.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.200
I ain't letting that happen.

16:09.900 --> 16:12.700
Melinda, you slept at the inn?

16:13.200 --> 16:15.000
Those kids needed me.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.700
They're under the influence
of this older kid, Rat.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.200
There's a ghost named Rat?

16:19.400 --> 16:22.600
Yeah. If I don't get them to cross over
before that building is torn down...

16:22.800 --> 16:24.900
Torn down?
But that's such a great old place.

16:25.100 --> 16:26.900
That's why the new owner
is gonna hear from

16:27.100 --> 16:29.300
the Grandview Historical Society.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.500
I didn't know there was a
Grandview Historical Society.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.100
Ah, there isn't yet.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.600
Hey, you should be vice-president.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.200
I got a "no." Anybody got a "no"?

16:38.400 --> 16:41.900
I got a "no" in the back.
I got a "no way." I got a big fat "no."

16:42.000 --> 16:43.100
Sold.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.900
Grandview Historical Society?

16:46.100 --> 16:49.000
- Never heard of it.
- Well, it's a small group.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.000
We wanna present you
with some options

16:51.200 --> 16:52.400
so that you can still make a profit.

16:52.600 --> 16:56.800
Ms Gordon, what's wrong with
providing luxury housing for hundreds,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.900
as opposed to an old hotel
that nobody stays at anymore?

17:00.200 --> 17:02.000
Can you just postpone the demolition?

17:02.100 --> 17:03.800
- Give us some time to...
- To what?

17:03.900 --> 17:06.700
To look for a way to preserve
a crumbling structure

17:07.000 --> 17:09.099
that once housed hapless orphans.

17:09.599 --> 17:13.000
Ms Gordon, I appreciate the good work
you're trying to do,

17:13.200 --> 17:15.599
but new construction it will be.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.200
Jim?

17:26.200 --> 17:27.400
Baby?

17:40.900 --> 17:42.600
Sorry, Mel. I didn't hear you.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.200
That's okay, Lew.

17:45.800 --> 17:46.900
I'm used to it.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.500
This stuff really works.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.100
I can feel my skin tightening.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.200
It tingles.

17:52.700 --> 17:53.900
Where's Jim?

17:54.100 --> 17:55.300
Don't know.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.400
Look, I'm exhausted. Can you just
get him out of here for the night?

17:59.600 --> 18:01.400
You know, take him
to the movies or something.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.100
You don't like him at all, do you?

18:03.200 --> 18:05.000
No, it's not that. It's just...

18:05.900 --> 18:07.300
I don't get you two.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.700
I've known the guy
since we were 14, you know? He's...

18:09.900 --> 18:12.700
He's the kind of guy you could
always call, 3:00 in the morning,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.400
if your car wouldn't start
or you were lost or worse.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.600
He's always been there for me,
no questions asked,

18:17.800 --> 18:19.500
and that counts for a lot.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.000
Okay. I get it.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.800
I'll find something for us to do tonight.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.900
But it isn't gonna be the movies.

18:31.100 --> 18:32.300
Why not?

18:33.600 --> 18:34.800
No margaritas.

19:24.800 --> 19:25.900
Just...

19:26.700 --> 19:27.700
Hi, Mel.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.100
Did you guys have fun?

19:29.300 --> 19:31.200
I kept him out of trouble.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.400
Honey, you remember
Terry and Ralph.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.400
Hello.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.500
Guys, get a beer. Get a beer.

19:41.400 --> 19:44.300
Look, I'm real... I'm sorry
about the intrusión. I'm sorry. I just...

19:44.500 --> 19:47.200
Oh, it's fine.
I should get back to the inn anyway.

19:47.400 --> 19:48.600
Wait a minute. What, now?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.300
Yeah. It'll be quieter there.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.600
I need to talk to Mr Abrams, so...
I won't be long.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.300
No... Hey. I'll keep them quiet.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.400
I'll put them in the back yard.

19:55.600 --> 19:59.000
No, it's okay. You guys have your fun.
I just figured it out.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.500
It's not about me not liking Lew.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.700
It's about me not liking
who you are around Lew.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.700
I'm sorry that it's so late.

20:11.900 --> 20:14.200
Oh, nonsense.
I'm happy for the company.

20:14.900 --> 20:17.000
I've been doing a lot
of reading on the fire,

20:17.100 --> 20:19.700
and it said that four boys were killed.

20:19.900 --> 20:21.600
I thought there were only three.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.300
No, four.

20:23.900 --> 20:26.900
Rat, Vic,

20:27.100 --> 20:28.600
Marty, Ernie.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.100
Ernie. Ernie Sutter.

20:31.300 --> 20:32.400
Yeah.

20:32.700 --> 20:36.400
He and Rat were the best of friends.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.700
They were inseparable.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
When they found their bodies,

20:41.200 --> 20:45.000
you would have expected
to find Ernie lying right next to Rat.

20:46.100 --> 20:47.800
But that's not what happened.

20:50.100 --> 20:52.400
They never found Ernie's body.

20:54.300 --> 20:56.200
The two little ones were...

20:56.700 --> 20:58.200
Were holding hands.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.900
The dog was right there with them.

21:04.200 --> 21:07.600
Tell him to shut up. He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.200
Later.

21:10.300 --> 21:11.500
I'm sorry?

21:13.200 --> 21:15.100
Late. It's getting late.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.400
Right you are.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.000
He's always shooting
his damn mouth off!

21:23.600 --> 21:24.700
Well,

21:25.500 --> 21:26.900
like I said,

21:28.100 --> 21:29.800
it gets spooky around here.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.000
Okay.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.900
That's normal.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.700
You see how Wendy
takes care of Peter

22:08.900 --> 22:11.400
after he returns home,
hurt from his battles?

22:12.200 --> 22:13.600
Like a mom would do.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.100
But she was so much more
than a mom to Peter.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.500
She was his friend, and they had
lots of adventures together,

22:20.700 --> 22:24.100
and that is what made
Tinker Bell very jealous.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.500
Sorry.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.100
Oh, boys, come back.

22:31.500 --> 22:32.900
Hey, did I scare them off?

22:34.300 --> 22:36.200
It is so good to see you.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.200
I'm sorry.

22:38.800 --> 22:41.100
I'm sorry. When you didn't come home,
I got worried.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.200
What's wrong?

22:46.700 --> 22:48.000
It's the boys.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.600
They break my heart.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.500
Maybe we should stay here tonight.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.600
It's a small bed.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.600
I think we'll manage.

22:58.600 --> 22:59.800
Okay.

23:12.300 --> 23:13.800
Oh, it's nothing.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.200
It's something.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.600
Oh, I can't believe it.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.000
They're getting ready for Monday.

23:25.700 --> 23:27.200
If Northrop tears this place down,

23:27.300 --> 23:29.900
it's like cutting the string on a balloon.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.200
These kids will have nothing
to hold on to.

23:39.300 --> 23:40.500
Yeah, Lew.

23:40.700 --> 23:43.100
I was just hooking the power up
to the fuse box,

23:43.300 --> 23:44.900
<i>and the whole thing
just sort of shorted out on me.</i>

23:45.100 --> 23:47.600
Sparks were flying.
Scared the hell out of me.

23:48.200 --> 23:50.500
Uh, there's no fire.

23:50.700 --> 23:51.800
<i>There"s no fire, though.</i>

23:52.000 --> 23:53.600
<i>We"re just gonna have
to do some rewiring.</i>

23:53.600 --> 23:55.000
I'll be right there.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.600
Little emergency.

23:57.800 --> 23:58.900
Oh, what, the house?

23:59.100 --> 24:00.600
Lew's there.

24:00.700 --> 24:03.800
I know.
It's nothing we can't handle, okay?

24:05.500 --> 24:07.300
I can do it. It's...

24:08.100 --> 24:09.200
You gonna be all right?

24:09.300 --> 24:10.700
- Yeah.
- All right.

24:11.300 --> 24:13.000
- Bye.
- Bye.

24:15.700 --> 24:18.000
I heard what you said last night.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.400
Whoa. What are you talking about?

24:20.600 --> 24:23.700
Old man Abrams.
Tells the fire story all the time.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.800
He don't know the most important part.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.000
What's the most important part?

24:34.200 --> 24:36.400
Well, I knew the way, all right.

24:36.500 --> 24:37.900
<i>WaKe up! WaKe up!</i>

24:37.900 --> 24:39.300
I always knew what to do.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.200
Get up, everyone! Get up!

24:41.400 --> 24:42.500
Wake up! Wake up!

24:42.500 --> 24:43.900
I gotta get something.

24:46.900 --> 24:48.400
That's why they followed me.

24:48.600 --> 24:51.100
<i>With all the smoKe and everything,
we got separated</i>

24:51.300 --> 24:53.800
<i>and Ernie went bacK upstairs.
I heard him yelling.</i>

24:54.800 --> 24:56.200
Except this one time...

24:56.400 --> 24:58.700
Ernie, you're going the wrong way!

25:00.400 --> 25:01.500
Ernie!

25:01.700 --> 25:03.200
...this one night...

25:05.000 --> 25:06.500
Over here. Follow me.

25:12.200 --> 25:13.400
...the doors were locked.

25:13.700 --> 25:15.000
<i>Who Knows why?</i>

25:15.200 --> 25:17.300
<i>New janitor, new rule.</i>

25:18.200 --> 25:19.800
I never knew.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.800
I looked down at the guys.

25:24.300 --> 25:25.800
I could see they were scared.

25:27.500 --> 25:31.400
Don't sit down, you guys.
We gotta find our way out. Come on.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.300
<i>I never saw Ernie again.</i>

25:33.500 --> 25:34.600
I'm really scared.

25:38.100 --> 25:39.600
It was my fault.

25:39.700 --> 25:41.600
I got them all killed.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.400
- It wasn't your fault.
- Yes, it was.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.000
You were trying to help them get out.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.100
How could you know
that those doors would be locked?

25:50.300 --> 25:51.600
They trusted me.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.400
I let them down.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.000
That is not true.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.400
They still love you, don't they?

25:57.600 --> 25:59.400
Most of the time they do.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.300
That's because you're a family, Rat.

26:01.400 --> 26:04.500
You're Peter and they're the Lost Boys,
and they need you.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.300
That's why I keep them together,

26:07.700 --> 26:09.400
make sure nothing happens to them.

26:12.100 --> 26:13.500
You can come in, boys.

26:16.100 --> 26:17.700
It's time for you to move on.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.800
You can't stay here forever.

26:22.100 --> 26:23.600
But we don't know anything but here.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.500
Did you see the bulldozer out front?

26:25.700 --> 26:27.500
They're gonna tear this place down.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.800
And you just have to trust me
that there's a better place.

26:31.500 --> 26:34.000
There's nothing, nothing to be afraid of.

26:34.800 --> 26:37.500
You think they want us
at the place she's talking about?

26:37.700 --> 26:39.500
Nobody wants us.

26:39.700 --> 26:42.300
This is the only place
we know we're safe.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.000
That's why we stay together.

26:44.100 --> 26:45.500
Look, I tell you what.

26:45.700 --> 26:48.300
Just come outside with me for one day.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.700
Let me prove to you
that you can be safe,

26:50.900 --> 26:53.000
you know, somewhere other than here.

26:53.400 --> 26:55.800
Sounds okay. Don't you think, Rat?

26:56.100 --> 26:58.700
If you want your feet to burn, go ahead.

26:58.900 --> 27:01.400
No matter what she says,
I ain't going nowhere.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.000
No fire.

27:17.800 --> 27:19.100
He lied.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.200
Maybe not.

27:21.300 --> 27:23.700
Maybe he really thinks
they do go on fire.

27:26.900 --> 27:28.400
Come on, boys.

28:41.100 --> 28:43.300
Why can't we just stay with you?

28:44.500 --> 28:45.600
Well, because...

28:45.800 --> 28:47.400
We both love you and everything.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.800
You could be our mother.

28:52.100 --> 28:55.600
I would be proud
to have you two as my sons.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.000
Any mother would.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.700
Then why can't we?

28:58.900 --> 29:00.800
Because you don't
belong here anymore.

29:01.700 --> 29:03.000
There's somewhere better.

29:03.100 --> 29:04.500
Can you go swimming there?

29:04.900 --> 29:06.400
Eat ice cream?

29:07.300 --> 29:09.900
I don't know for sure.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.300
But what I do know is...

29:14.100 --> 29:16.200
Is that you'll be wanted there.

29:16.400 --> 29:19.000
And no one
will ever abandon you again.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.500
But you won't be there, will you?

29:21.800 --> 29:23.000
Someday.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.100
Someday I will.

29:25.500 --> 29:28.900
And for you, it'll feel like no time at all.

29:29.700 --> 29:31.800
If Rat don't go, we don't go.

29:36.700 --> 29:39.000
All right, we're moving on
to our next item, ladies and gentlemen,

29:39.200 --> 29:40.500
Lot number 85,

29:40.700 --> 29:43.600
which is a beautiful
late '40s-era cradle.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.200
We're gonna start the bidding at $20...

29:45.400 --> 29:46.500
Thirty! $50!

29:46.700 --> 29:48.100
- $ 150!
- $200!

29:48.200 --> 29:49.300
$2,000!

29:49.500 --> 29:51.000
- Wonderful. $20.
- Shh!

29:51.100 --> 29:52.700
$25. Okay, wonderful.

29:52.800 --> 29:54.200
$25.

29:54.300 --> 29:55.600
$3 million!

29:56.300 --> 29:58.200
- $5 trillion!
...$25. Can I get $30?

29:58.400 --> 29:59.500
- $ 1 trillion!
- Shh!

29:59.500 --> 30:01.400
Oh, my God, you're out of control.

30:01.600 --> 30:02.900
So that's how it works, huh?

30:03.100 --> 30:05.700
Take our stuff, sell it, keep the dough.

30:05.900 --> 30:08.200
You see that store over there? Go.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.700
Now!

30:10.200 --> 30:11.500
Oh, you guys are out...

30:11.600 --> 30:13.400
Whoa! Hey! It's not me that's on sale.

30:13.900 --> 30:17.300
But... All right,
we're gonna move on to Lot, um, 86.

30:18.200 --> 30:21.100
This isn't about old,
beat-up furniture, is it, Rat?

30:23.300 --> 30:25.000
There's something I gotta ask you.

30:25.300 --> 30:26.500
What is it?

30:27.500 --> 30:29.000
And you can't lie to me, either.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.400
I gotta know the truth.
Grown-ups always lie.

30:33.600 --> 30:34.900
I promise.

30:39.900 --> 30:41.900
Am I gonna see my brother,
Mikey, again?

30:43.800 --> 30:45.400
Will he be there?

30:46.800 --> 30:48.000
Yes, Rat.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.700
Your brother
will be right there waiting for you.

30:54.300 --> 30:56.000
They said I'd see him again.

30:57.700 --> 30:59.100
A family took him,

31:00.400 --> 31:01.700
not me.

31:04.600 --> 31:05.700
They lied.

31:07.100 --> 31:09.500
It's the truth this time, I promise.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.700
And Marty and Vic, they'll come?

31:13.400 --> 31:16.100
They're your family.
You'll all be together.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.600
- Thank you.
- Sure.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.000
Well, he can fix it.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.100
I knew it. I didn't think it was that bad.

31:40.300 --> 31:43.200
Look, Lew, look,
I can't do this, all right?

31:43.300 --> 31:44.900
- Do what?
- Play along.

31:45.100 --> 31:47.300
Make believe that this
does not piss me off.

31:47.800 --> 31:49.400
- Take it easy.
- No, "take it easy."

31:49.600 --> 31:51.400
You come into my house,

31:51.400 --> 31:53.300
you act like a fool, huh?
You disrespect my wife...

31:53.500 --> 31:56.000
- Hey, no, come on. I did not...
- Lew, wake up, Lew, okay?

31:56.200 --> 31:58.300
You're my friend,
but we're not 18 anymore.

31:59.200 --> 32:02.100
Look, just pack your stuff.
I'll see you later, huh?

32:03.900 --> 32:05.000
Fine.

32:07.400 --> 32:08.700
We're at $25.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.700
This lovely lady in the front, $25.

32:10.900 --> 32:13.300
Do I hear... $30?

32:13.500 --> 32:15.600
$30. Anybody with $35? $30...

32:15.900 --> 32:17.700
I'm sorry. We're still at $30. $35, sir.

32:17.800 --> 32:21.000
$30? You sure?
I... You look like you have $35 to me.

32:21.300 --> 32:23.500
Is there anybody for $40?

32:23.700 --> 32:25.800
Anybody? $40? Okay...

33:04.900 --> 33:07.700
I think I might just bid on this piece.

33:09.100 --> 33:11.300
Should've made it part
of the deal with Abrams.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.200
You're Ernie, aren't you?

33:15.400 --> 33:16.500
No.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.500
You're the boy that got away.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.800
That's how you knew
that the Kensington was an orphanage.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.200
You were there.

33:22.600 --> 33:25.200
You don't have to pay me.
It belongs to you.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.800
You have me confused
with somebody else.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.400
Ernest Sutter.
That was your name, wasn't it?

33:44.600 --> 33:46.600
No idea what you're talking about.

33:46.700 --> 33:48.200
Best of luck with the rest of the auction.

33:48.400 --> 33:49.900
Don't go, please.

33:50.500 --> 33:52.800
I cannot tell you
how important this is to me.

33:53.200 --> 33:54.900
And the boys who died there.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.400
You were there, weren't you?

33:58.600 --> 34:01.300
I wanna level that horrible place.

34:01.700 --> 34:03.600
I wanna turn it into a grave.

34:03.800 --> 34:07.500
I've spent 50 years
trying to outrun those memories.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.500
In every child I pass on the sidewalk,

34:10.699 --> 34:14.000
every photo in a magazine, I see them.

34:16.400 --> 34:19.600
They died and I lived. Why?

34:19.900 --> 34:21.699
You were only a child.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.500
They were my family.

34:24.699 --> 34:26.000
I can help you.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.600
How?

34:37.000 --> 34:38.300
<i>Come on!</i>

34:47.300 --> 34:49.100
I used to hide in the basement.

34:49.300 --> 34:50.800
My alone place.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.699
<i>No one ever looked
for me down there.</i>

34:55.600 --> 34:58.500
Sometimes I'd just sleep or daydream.

34:58.800 --> 35:02.000
Sometimes I'd read.

35:03.300 --> 35:05.500
<i>I Kept my little secrets down there.</i>

35:05.700 --> 35:07.400
<i>Matches, candle.</i>

35:08.700 --> 35:10.000
<i>That night, though...</i>

35:11.100 --> 35:13.700
That night I heard Homer barking.

35:13.900 --> 35:15.800
I thought he was in trouble.

35:17.300 --> 35:19.000
I went to find him.

35:21.500 --> 35:23.100
I meant to come back.

35:23.200 --> 35:26.400
I meant to blow out
the candle and hide it again.

35:27.100 --> 35:30.300
But one thing led to another.
They called bedtime.

35:32.500 --> 35:34.200
I forgot all about it.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.500
Wake up!

35:37.800 --> 35:41.200
I didn't even remember it until later.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.800
When the fire started, I was just
trying to get out like everyone else.

35:45.900 --> 35:47.500
- No, Rat, no! Wait!
- Where are we going?

35:49.300 --> 35:50.700
Where's Ernie?

35:52.000 --> 35:54.300
<i>Ernie, it"s the wrong way! Come on!</i>

35:55.500 --> 35:56.600
Up here!

35:56.800 --> 35:58.300
Ernie! Come here! Come on!

35:59.200 --> 36:00.300
Ernie!

36:04.700 --> 36:06.500
And when I saw it burning

36:06.600 --> 36:09.000
and I didn't see the boys get out,

36:11.700 --> 36:12.800
I ran.

36:22.900 --> 36:24.500
I just kept running.

36:25.900 --> 36:29.100
Somehow I knew that no matter what,

36:29.800 --> 36:31.800
I was not coming back here.

36:37.400 --> 36:40.200
Next day
I saw the front page of the newspaper.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.300
I saw the pictures of the fire

36:42.700 --> 36:44.100
and the boys,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
and one of them was me.

36:49.400 --> 36:53.400
Twelve-year-old orphan
Ernest Sutter was dead.

36:56.400 --> 36:59.100
I remember climbing
into a trash bin and crying

36:59.300 --> 37:00.500
till my throat hurt.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.500
This was my friend Rat's hideout.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.200
Ronald Aikins Tracy.

37:18.400 --> 37:19.500
R.A.T.

37:20.300 --> 37:21.600
He hated his name.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.200
Loved his nickname.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.400
He was one tough customer.

37:25.800 --> 37:28.800
Nobody messed with you
if you were okay with Rat.

37:33.300 --> 37:34.700
You gotta tell him.

37:35.700 --> 37:38.000
What if I told you
that Rat was still here?

37:38.700 --> 37:39.900
What?

37:40.200 --> 37:41.800
The boys are still here.

37:44.200 --> 37:45.700
I don't understand.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.200
They're not dead?

37:47.400 --> 37:48.600
They are dead.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.100
But their spirits...
Well, they were afraid to move on.

37:53.300 --> 37:56.500
That can't be.
I don't believe in that kind of stuff.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.000
Yeah. Most people don't.

37:59.900 --> 38:01.000
Tell him

38:02.900 --> 38:04.400
it's still there

38:05.200 --> 38:06.700
where he hid it.

38:06.900 --> 38:10.500
He says
that it's still there where you hid it.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.800
This must be a dream.

38:50.100 --> 38:52.500
Rat, is that you?

38:52.700 --> 38:54.800
Tell him to use his indoor voice.
We ain't deaf.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.900
He says for you
to use your indoor voice.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.500
"We ain't deaf."

38:59.600 --> 39:01.500
Son of a... It is Rat.

39:01.600 --> 39:02.800
Tell him Homer's here!

39:03.000 --> 39:05.600
- You got your teeth fixed.
- You're really getting old, Ernie.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.800
Hey, one at a time.

39:08.100 --> 39:11.000
Okay. Vic wants you to know
that Homer's here,

39:11.400 --> 39:14.700
Marty thinks you're getting old,
and Rat says your teeth are fixed?

39:15.000 --> 39:16.100
No cavities.

39:17.700 --> 39:19.900
They're all false. Mine fell out.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.400
They're laughing.

39:26.500 --> 39:27.800
Where's Rat?

39:28.600 --> 39:30.200
Right in front of you.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.800
You were the brave one, Rat.

39:32.900 --> 39:35.000
You were trying to save us.

39:35.500 --> 39:38.100
You always knew the right thing to do.

39:38.600 --> 39:40.500
I can't tell you how many times

39:40.700 --> 39:41.900
when I was out on the road

39:42.000 --> 39:44.500
and I'd think back
on all the things you taught me.

39:44.600 --> 39:49.100
And not book things. Like how
to survive and laugh at yourself.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.800
And I'm still always thinking,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.400
"What would Rat do if he was here?"

39:57.400 --> 40:00.300
You're so full of it, Ernie,
it's coming out of your ears.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.900
He wants to know
if you really think that.

40:05.100 --> 40:06.400
Yes, I do.

40:09.900 --> 40:10.900
Rat,

40:14.800 --> 40:17.600
I would give all the money
I have in the worid

40:18.200 --> 40:20.100
to see you one more time.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.300
All of you.

40:23.500 --> 40:25.300
You ain't gonna make me cry, Ernie.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.100
He's crying.

40:28.300 --> 40:30.800
Don't tell him that! Tell him

40:32.500 --> 40:34.700
he could tear down the inn if he wants.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.000
We're going.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.700
Rat says they're leaving.

40:44.900 --> 40:46.200
Where are they going?

40:54.600 --> 40:56.000
On a new adventure.

41:13.100 --> 41:14.300
Goodbye, pal.

41:29.700 --> 41:30.800
Do you see it?

41:33.900 --> 41:35.000
Yeah.

41:35.500 --> 41:36.600
A light.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.000
Handsome.

41:46.300 --> 41:47.600
I'm telling everybody

41:48.800 --> 41:50.500
that you're my mom.

42:00.300 --> 42:02.000
I ain't scared, Rat.

42:03.300 --> 42:04.400
Me neither.

42:07.800 --> 42:08.900
Mikey.

42:10.100 --> 42:11.900
I can see my brother.

42:12.700 --> 42:14.300
He's laughing at me.

42:14.300 --> 42:16.400
Where have I been, he wants to know.

42:26.900 --> 42:28.200
Goodbye, Wendy.

42:30.200 --> 42:31.700
Goodbye, Peter.

42:48.100 --> 42:49.300
Are they gone?

42:50.400 --> 42:51.600
Yes.

42:52.900 --> 42:54.600
I never felt like this before.

42:54.800 --> 42:57.600
Like I'm free.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.100
Thank you.

43:15.200 --> 43:16.800
I hate to admit it,

43:17.300 --> 43:19.500
but now I kind of feel sorry for Lew.

43:20.800 --> 43:21.900
Me, too.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.600
He changed, I guess.

43:25.100 --> 43:26.300
I don't know.

43:27.100 --> 43:30.500
I don't think he changed. You did.

43:31.100 --> 43:32.600
All I know

43:34.500 --> 43:36.200
is that I'm glad I have you.

44:10.500 --> 44:12.400
Do you wanna explain that?

44:13.200 --> 44:16.000
Tomorrow. Let's just go back to bed.

44:17.100 --> 44:18.200
Yeah.

44:22.300 --> 44:23.500
Stop.
