WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.200
.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.680
I finished with Mitch.
No.

00:11.760 --> 00:12.960
Oh, shit.

00:13.040 --> 00:15.320
Hi! I'm back!

00:15.400 --> 00:17.000
I'm single now.
(all squeal)

00:17.080 --> 00:18.480
I am fucking buzzing.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.880
You what?

00:22.560 --> 00:26.120
Why the hell are you back with that
fucking arsehole? You all right?

00:26.200 --> 00:28.520
I'm finding it impossible
to have a good time

00:28.600 --> 00:31.480
with people who just don't accept
my boyfriend.Hi!

00:31.560 --> 00:34.760
Fucking fresh fanny? Scott's the one
who will fuck you over.

00:34.840 --> 00:38.600
That's why I'm in love with him.
Don't worry. I won't go near Scott.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.520
What happened to girl code?
Oi, oi.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.200
Me and Martin have shagged.
It's a big-un.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.000
Part-ay!

00:49.320 --> 00:52.480
No lad gets to treat me like a mug
and gets away with it.

00:52.560 --> 00:55.360
Fuck you.I cannot believe
the kid has grassed me up.

00:55.440 --> 00:57.680
The two newbies can suck me
clean off.

00:58.480 --> 00:59.920
(all squeal)

01:01.120 --> 01:03.800
Fuck. This is not going well.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.680
Did I just see Marnie kiss Marty?

01:06.760 --> 01:10.480
You've been all over him! She knows
not to go there, you fucking bitch.

01:10.560 --> 01:11.600
(shouting)

01:11.680 --> 01:13.920
I've got Chloe's back on this one.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.440
(all shouting) I feel so bad that me
and Charlotte got physical.

01:17.520 --> 01:20.520
I'm sorry. There's a friendship
worth salvaging.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.240
I need to get out of this bed.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.960
I've never seen him this stressed.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.760
Enough's enough. I'm off.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.040
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.520
I would never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.400
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.800
Get me in this house,
I'm gonna tear it up.

01:43.880 --> 01:46.320
I wrap the lads
round my little finger.

01:46.400 --> 01:50.120
I'm preened to perfection.
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.560
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.600
My banter's pure naughty.

01:54.680 --> 01:57.200
I'm fake, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.280
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:08.600 --> 02:09.880
Good morning, campers.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.360
Morning. Did yous two do anything
last night?

02:12.520 --> 02:15.880
No, mate. She tried to wank us off
about five times. Whatever.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.320
I'm happy that I've woken up
next to Marty

02:18.400 --> 02:21.640
but I haven't talked to Marnie yet.
This is the worst argument

02:21.720 --> 02:24.840
I've had with Marnie.
It's the longest we've not speaked.

02:24.920 --> 02:27.200
I can see why Chloe's pissed off
with Marnie

02:27.280 --> 02:30.680
but their friendship means more
than a stupid kiss with a boy.

02:31.920 --> 02:35.080
Where's Chloe, then?
She stayed in the bed with Marty.

02:35.160 --> 02:38.800
It's obvious that she likes him.
Yeah. I don't know if I'm gonna be

02:38.880 --> 02:41.000
as close to Chloe as we have been.
Nah.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.960
The other night I flirted with Marty
to get back at Aaron

02:44.040 --> 02:46.080
and Chloe made a massive deal
about it.

02:46.160 --> 02:49.520
If she'd told us that she liked him,
it wouldn't have happened.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.720
I think she needs to start
being honest

02:51.800 --> 02:53.680
about how she feels about people.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.680
Did yous sort things out?
Yeah.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.840
No more fights, yeah?
No. Never, never.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.360
Couldn't have done another day,
it was awful.

03:00.440 --> 03:04.280
Me and Marnie have fought in the
past but this time it turned nasty.

03:04.360 --> 03:07.920
Marnie might look cute
but she fights dirty.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.920
Is it weird Gary not being here?

03:10.000 --> 03:13.240
I did miss him last night.
I was very, very upset about that.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.120
Waking up with Gary not being here
is horrible.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.800
It's just not like him
to leave like that.

03:18.880 --> 03:20.680
I just hope he's OK.

03:26.800 --> 03:30.840
I think we need some fun,
fresh air and freedom.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.720
With us girls fighting
and Gary leaving the house,

03:33.800 --> 03:35.800
we all need something
to cheer us up.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.960
And I think I've got just the plan.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.240
I thought we could go to the beach.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.000
The beach? Really, Charlotte?

03:42.080 --> 03:45.320
It's colder than a penguin's arse
out there, for fuck's sake.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.640
Are yous up for it?
Yeah.Yeah, let's do it.

03:47.720 --> 03:50.200
Since finding out
Scott is a massive bell-end,

03:50.280 --> 03:52.480
it's been hard living in the house
with him

03:52.560 --> 03:55.000
so getting out
hopefully will change my mood.

03:55.080 --> 03:57.000
Come on, then, girls. Howay, lads!

04:04.600 --> 04:08.200
We get to the beach, nice fresh air
in my lungs and I'm not gonna lie,

04:08.280 --> 04:11.360
it feels so good to get out
that fucking house.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.480
(all screaming)

04:13.560 --> 04:14.880
Go, Scott! Go, Scott!

04:16.600 --> 04:19.080
Who won? This may be a family day
out to the beach

04:19.160 --> 04:20.480
but what's canny awkward

04:20.560 --> 04:23.880
is Chantelle still isn't speaking
with us. Fucking bothered.

04:23.960 --> 04:28.240
Whah! Us girls have been bottling up
our emotions for far too long

04:28.320 --> 04:32.480
so I've come up with the perfect way
to let it all out.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.920
We want you to get
all of the anger out.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.240
Shout into the sea
and watch it get washed away.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.400
I'll give anything a go
to make us feel better about Scott.

04:42.480 --> 04:45.400
Fuck you, Scott!

04:45.480 --> 04:48.520
I really don't wanna see your face
again.

04:48.600 --> 04:52.560
Cos you're a fucking piece of shit!
(both laugh)

04:52.640 --> 04:55.480
I do feel for Chantelle
but I did warn her.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.680
Scott will not change for anyone.

04:57.760 --> 05:03.200
So fuck you and now I'm gonna be
happy and no fucking drama!

05:03.280 --> 05:06.720
I put a brave face on for the girls
and let them think that it helped

05:06.800 --> 05:11.320
but really it was a load of bollocks.
I feel better, I feel emotional.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.400
Charlotte, go.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.480
Er, right.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.400
Go on, you can do it.
I know what I wanna say.

05:18.480 --> 05:22.320
Sometimes when you're put on the
spot, your true feelings come out.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.560
I was never good enough!

05:25.640 --> 05:28.400
You got with another girl...

05:28.480 --> 05:31.320
I thought I was over Gary
but obviously I'm not.

05:31.400 --> 05:35.320
...who is shit craic...
(Chloe guffaws)

05:35.400 --> 05:37.120
...and abandoned me!

05:38.040 --> 05:41.480
I'm still angry you're still
with Lillie! (voice cracks)

05:41.560 --> 05:44.520
Oh, my God!
Oh!

05:44.600 --> 05:47.880
I suppose part of us
is always gonna love him.

05:48.880 --> 05:52.600
And it's taken Gary leaving
for me to see it.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.320
We're back in the house.
The beach was pure mint

06:00.400 --> 06:02.680
but tonight
is gonna go fucking off.

06:05.320 --> 06:08.600
It is a bit weird Gaz not being
here. I haven't had an argument.

06:08.680 --> 06:11.240
You haven't been launching objects.
I know.

06:11.320 --> 06:14.080
I thinking, "When am I gonna get
chucked about?"

06:14.160 --> 06:17.000
Tonight will be wicked,
even though Gaz isn't here.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.880
Let's go out, get fucking mortal.

06:18.960 --> 06:22.040
I'm on the pull tonight.
I'm not getting pied again. Nae go.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.120
If you don't pull, are you gonna use
Chloe as a back-up?

06:25.200 --> 06:28.240
It depends how pissed I am.
Marty better not be using Chloe

06:28.320 --> 06:30.800
as a back-up plan.
She got fucked about by Scott

06:30.880 --> 06:33.600
and she doesn't need it off him.
She's grafting us.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.160
Mate, it's not a good thing.

06:35.240 --> 06:38.280
When I got grafted, I felt like
a fucking scratch-post.

06:38.360 --> 06:41.560
What's happening?
Just finishing up a bit of make-up.

06:41.640 --> 06:44.160
I still haven't spoke to Chloe
and it's horrible

06:44.240 --> 06:48.120
that we're avoiding each other. She's
supposed to be one my best friends.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.640
What'll happen with Chloe?I hope
we'll be able to make friends.

06:51.720 --> 06:55.280
I don't like the awkwardness.
We haven't spoke and it's horrible.

06:55.360 --> 06:56.960
It's a shame it's come to this.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.520
I think she wanted to make
a mountain out of a...

06:59.600 --> 07:03.560
What's that saying?
A mountain out of a road hump.

07:03.640 --> 07:06.680
Me and Marnie didn't really click
when she first came in

07:06.760 --> 07:08.920
and even though
this is a shit situation,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.160
it's brought we closer together.

07:13.680 --> 07:16.880
I'm fucking horny.
No-one in this house is having sex.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.760
Got a vibrator.
Exactly, there's a vibrator here.

07:19.840 --> 07:23.320
Have anyone used it? I've never
gone this long without sex before.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.800
When Kyle was here,
I used to get it all the time

07:25.880 --> 07:28.480
and now look at me.
I'm sniffing a fucking dildo!

07:28.560 --> 07:31.240
I'm the only one getting action
at the minute. Why?

07:32.960 --> 07:35.640
I've been tashing on with Marty
and having a fumble

07:35.720 --> 07:37.480
but that's not enough. I want sex.

07:37.560 --> 07:41.000
I did try to touch his willy
but I don't think he wanted us to.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.040
Why? Why?
I think he wants to wait.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.000
(all laugh)

07:45.080 --> 07:47.680
Marty wants to wait? Wait for what?

07:47.760 --> 07:49.240
Chloe to pop the question?

07:49.320 --> 07:52.000
Right, then.
Fucking ready to bounce, like!

07:53.120 --> 07:55.960
It's weird Gaz not being here
but it's not gonna stop we

07:56.040 --> 07:58.720
from having a wicked night.
Lads, we're going oot.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.520
(all) Cheers!
Cheers, you fucking rascals!

08:02.600 --> 08:04.960
(all laugh and squeal)

08:05.040 --> 08:07.120
Fucking hair just went down!

08:14.080 --> 08:16.920
We're in Bijoux
and the place is pumping.

08:22.520 --> 08:24.880
(all cheer)
Time to party, bitches!

08:32.560 --> 08:33.640
The club is bouncing

08:33.720 --> 08:36.560
but I can't enjoy myself
until I've made up with Chloe.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.760
This argument has gone on
way too long.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.480
I just hope that Chloe and Marnie
can make up

08:46.560 --> 08:49.240
cos at the end of the day,
Marty isn't worth it.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.040
Me and Chloe were once so close.
She was my best friend.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.760
I don't want it to be like this.
I just want her back.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.440
Arguing with Marnie
has really upset us.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.800
Our friendship means more
than a argument,

09:12.880 --> 09:15.520
especially over a lad
she doesn't even like.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.200
Howay, let's not argue over Marty.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.520
Let's get fucking mortal
and be friends.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.920
I'm glad that we've cleared the air.
Chloe's my best friend

09:32.000 --> 09:34.520
and I hate us fighting.
Now time to get mortal.

09:38.240 --> 09:41.200
Marnie is looking fucking fit
and she's all over us.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.080
So surely we'll end up
in the Shag Pad tonight.

09:45.720 --> 09:49.080
It's just so weird without Gary.

09:49.160 --> 09:52.040
It just doesn't feel right.
He's been gone a while now.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.800
What the fuck is he doing?

09:58.480 --> 10:01.280
I'm so glad that me and Charlotte
are friends again.

10:01.360 --> 10:03.960
Without Gary being here,
she's like a lost puppy.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.080
But with that hair,
more like a poodle.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.920
I can tell by just looking at Holly
that she's really down

10:16.000 --> 10:17.920
and I'm really worried about her.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.000
In this house, nobody likes
my relationship with Kyle

10:22.080 --> 10:25.200
and it's making us feel like
I don't belong here any more.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.560
I miss the old Holly
but I just gotta accept

10:32.640 --> 10:36.280
that nothing's gonna change
while she's with Kyle. The twat.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.960
Well, to be fair, Holly,
you're kind of right.

10:44.680 --> 10:47.520
I miss not having Kyle around
but this is one head-fuck

10:47.600 --> 10:49.000
I don't wanna think about.

10:49.080 --> 10:52.120
I just wanna get mortal
and try and have a good time.

10:55.360 --> 10:58.440
I've pulled two birds.
This is fucking mint.

11:01.800 --> 11:05.080
This morning I woke up in Marty's
bed and I actually do like him

11:05.160 --> 11:08.600
so for him to bring two lasses over,
it's a kick in the fanny, like.

11:13.160 --> 11:15.800
This little quiff-shit
has only just arrived.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.720
He's caused so much drama already

11:17.800 --> 11:20.080
and I hope
he doesn't fuck Chloe about.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.840
He better not be another Scott.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.480
Marty might be new to the house

11:26.560 --> 11:29.600
but he's acting like the rest
of the lads. What an idiot.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.840
Marty thinks he's pure wicked
cos he's having a three-way kiss.

11:37.920 --> 11:42.000
I've had about 4,000 of them, kid.
You fucking menage-a-twat.

11:45.200 --> 11:48.120
Marty can take his threesome
and shove it up his arse.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.280
I'm off to pull a fucking worldie.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.360
I can't believe how quick
I've actually pulled a lad.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.480
I'm actually proper buzzing myself.

11:59.560 --> 12:01.000
(farts, giggles)

12:01.640 --> 12:03.960
Chloe's necking on
with some little radgie

12:04.040 --> 12:05.680
and I cannot wait to tell Marty.

12:05.760 --> 12:08.360
Revenge is sweet,
you little pencil dick.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.440
Seeing Chloe neck on
with that fucking radgie

12:14.520 --> 12:18.480
has made us realise I like her a
little bit more than what I thought.

12:18.560 --> 12:21.120
That kid needs to go.
Off you pop, mate.

12:22.120 --> 12:25.480
Look who's come crawling back.
As soon as Chloe pulls,

12:25.560 --> 12:28.200
Marty's all over her
like a tramp on chips.

12:30.480 --> 12:34.080
I don't know what the fuck Marty
said to my lad but he's put him off.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.720
Hang on a minute.
I think he's jealous.

12:36.800 --> 12:37.840
And I like it!

12:37.920 --> 12:40.560
Now that little knacker
has finally nashed,

12:40.640 --> 12:44.160
it's time to get back to the house
and put some graft in with Chloe.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.680
Hello!

12:48.760 --> 12:51.080
(all laughing)

12:53.760 --> 12:58.240
We're all so drunk. What better way
to end the night than a lap dance?

13:00.120 --> 13:03.800
Oh! I'm so glad that me and Marnie
have finally made up.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.760
I really missed our sexy time.

13:05.840 --> 13:08.360
(screaming)

13:08.440 --> 13:13.200
Lap dancing? More like crap dancing.
The girls are fucking mortal.

13:13.280 --> 13:17.240
Oh! She kissed that bitch! Oh!

13:17.320 --> 13:19.440
She just kissed her vagina.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.280
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

13:21.360 --> 13:24.080
Normally, I would pay good money
for this shit.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.320
She kissed her on the lips.

13:26.400 --> 13:29.400
I've had a great night
but it's time for bed

13:29.480 --> 13:31.880
and there's only one place
I wanna sleep

13:31.960 --> 13:33.960
and that's Gary's bed.

13:37.800 --> 13:41.240
Marnie was a nice starter but now
I'm ready for the main course.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.400
Come here, Marty.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.520
You know I like ya?
We're necking on

13:45.600 --> 13:47.320
and I hear voices from my boxers.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.440
It's my balls telling us
to get Chloe in that Shag Pad now.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.240
Wanna go there now?
Let's go now.

13:52.320 --> 13:55.520
Ooh, Shag Pad! Whoo!

13:57.040 --> 14:01.760
My clit has been kicking off and
I finally got Marty in the Shag Pad.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.880
This night can't be any better.

14:06.800 --> 14:10.400
I am so horny.
We're kissing, we're touching.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.720
Wait there. Something isn't right.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.800
This never happens. Honestly.
Never, ever happens.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.160
I'm fucking embarrassed

14:24.240 --> 14:26.480
and the words
that come out my mouth is...

14:31.400 --> 14:34.200
Love you as a friend?
For fuck's sake.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.960
What is this house doing to me?

14:36.040 --> 14:38.960
Honestly.
Martin, I actually don't care.

14:39.040 --> 14:42.480
What the fuck? I've been waiting
for this all night.

14:42.560 --> 14:46.480
I'm young, I'm dumb
and I'm not full of cum.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.400
I was like,
"I'm not getting a stiffy."

14:55.280 --> 14:59.880
A floppy cock is no laughing matter
but this is fucking hilarious.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.320
I do really wanna spend the night
with Aaron

15:02.400 --> 15:05.960
but I feel obliged, as a friend,
to give Chloe some attention.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.320
And we have just made up.

15:07.400 --> 15:12.240
We have to go to bed with each other.
I have been feeling horny all night.

15:12.320 --> 15:15.400
I am getting fucked.
I'm gonna fuck a fucking dildo.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.880
There's only one thing for it.
Where's my dildo?!

15:18.960 --> 15:22.080
(both giggling)

15:22.160 --> 15:24.840
If in doubt, pull the plastic out.

15:26.720 --> 15:29.680
Me and Marnie are just bezzies.
Not lezzies.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.400
Agh! Oh, my God!

15:33.480 --> 15:35.520
I mean, I'll just take one
for the team.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.040
What else are friends for?

15:52.840 --> 15:55.920
21-year-old stallion,
can't even get a fucking stiffy up.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.160
I've woke up
with morning fucking glory.

15:58.240 --> 16:02.160
Why weren't you working last night?
Felt like whacking it up floppy.

16:02.240 --> 16:05.560
Marty Droopy Dick.
Marty Soft Cock McKenna.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.960
That's got a canny good ring to it,
I reckon.

16:08.040 --> 16:10.320
The floppiest cock
in the North-East.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.360
The new lad is getting ripped
to bits but to be fair to him,

16:13.440 --> 16:14.760
he's taking it on the chin

16:14.840 --> 16:17.760
and that's what being a lad
in this house is all about.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.320
Do you remember what I remember?

16:23.400 --> 16:26.920
Maybe. I know me and Chloe
only just made up yesterday

16:27.000 --> 16:29.360
but I think we took it
a little bit too far.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.080
I'm so embarrassed.

16:31.160 --> 16:34.280
You know what they say.
Sharing's caring! (laughs)

16:34.360 --> 16:36.960
Listen, this is how good
the vibration is.

16:37.040 --> 16:40.320
Jesus, sounds like
a fucking sledgehammer. Hello?

16:40.400 --> 16:42.680
(giggling)
I am gutted about what happened

16:42.760 --> 16:45.520
between me and Marty last night
because I do like him.

16:45.600 --> 16:49.320
I'm actually a bit embarrassed.
And friend-zone? What's that about?

16:50.640 --> 16:53.600
That was my first night out
without Gary since he's gone.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.400
What did you think?
It was a bit weird, wasn't it?

16:56.480 --> 16:59.160
I've woke up in Gary's bed.
It's been a long time

16:59.240 --> 17:01.840
since that happened.
And he's not even here!

17:01.920 --> 17:05.080
What do you think's going on?
It must be serious

17:05.160 --> 17:08.280
for him to be away for this long.
I just hope he's all right.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.760
Gary still isn't back.
He's been away far too long

17:11.840 --> 17:14.200
and now I'm starting to get worried.

17:18.280 --> 17:20.800
We're all proper rough
from last night

17:20.880 --> 17:23.320
and the girls have barely moved
all day.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.800
Right, then. Let's get ready.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.600
I've been away from the house
for what feels like forever.

17:30.680 --> 17:34.040
Walking back through this door,
I am so nervous.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.320
I've got some massive news
for everyone

17:36.400 --> 17:38.840
but I'm not sure
how it's gonna go down.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.760
Hello?
I'm in the boys' bedroom

17:41.840 --> 17:44.880
and I can hear Gary's voice.
It's fucking about time

17:44.960 --> 17:46.680
that kid is back in this house.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.080
Hey! Gary's back! (laughs)

17:49.160 --> 17:51.000
It's Gary. He's back!

17:51.080 --> 17:54.080
Hi, handsome!Get everyone down.
Everybody's upstairs

17:54.160 --> 17:55.800
so I called them all down.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.680
I'm pure buzzing that Gaz is back

17:57.760 --> 18:00.280
but why the fuck's he calling
a house meeting?

18:00.360 --> 18:04.720
This is the one place where bad news
always gets broken.

18:07.080 --> 18:09.680
(exhales) Here it goes.

18:13.840 --> 18:16.960
Gaz has called everyone to the sofa
but he's standing there

18:17.040 --> 18:19.440
and he hasn't took his coat off.
What the fuck is going on?

18:19.520 --> 18:23.400
Right. First of all,
I wanna say sorry for leaving.

18:23.480 --> 18:26.320
That's the only thing.
I'm trying to talk to everyone

18:26.400 --> 18:28.840
but my lip's going,
my knees are going.

18:28.920 --> 18:31.240
Erm, I had to go
and talk to a few people.

18:31.320 --> 18:34.680
The people that are closest to me.
He looks like he's so nervous

18:34.760 --> 18:37.320
to tell us something
and I'm actually shaking.

18:37.400 --> 18:41.120
Obviously, I've came back
to tell yous that...

18:41.200 --> 18:43.000
(sighs) Erm...

18:46.880 --> 18:49.960
I literally can't live in this house
any longer.

18:50.040 --> 18:52.960
No.
No, no, no, no, no!

18:53.040 --> 18:54.840
No, no, no, no. I'm not leaving.

18:54.920 --> 18:58.040
I can't live in this house
in a relationship.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.360
Oh, fuck me!
Fucking hell!

19:00.440 --> 19:02.080
(chuckles)
Oh, my good God!

19:02.160 --> 19:04.800
So the decision I've made,

19:04.880 --> 19:08.040
erm... after a lot of thought is...

19:08.120 --> 19:10.920
erm, I've finished with Lillie
and I'm back.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.240
Gary's back and he's single!

19:14.320 --> 19:16.360
What the fuck?!

19:16.440 --> 19:18.680
So I'm not going anywhere,
I'm staying.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.080
My heart burst out of my chest.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.160
I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy

19:23.240 --> 19:25.800
what I've just been through
in the last few days.

19:25.880 --> 19:29.520
It's one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.360
Buck Squad back in action, mate.

19:31.440 --> 19:35.480
The kid's back and he's single. The
fucking Buck Squad is back on form.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.880
That's if he even knows what to do
any more.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.320
Aw!

19:39.400 --> 19:43.800
The family's back together. Now let's
go upstairs, get ready for tonight.

19:45.840 --> 19:50.400
How do you feel?It's a sad time.
Gary must be feeling awful but...

19:50.480 --> 19:53.720
I know I've said I'd be scared
if Gary was single again

19:53.800 --> 19:57.240
but I don't feel scared.
I just feel really fucking excited!

19:57.320 --> 19:59.320
You need to get dressed up,
get sexy.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.560
Get dressed, let's get ready.
I look like a lumberjack.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.240
We're getting ready,
I'm buzzing that Gary's back

20:10.320 --> 20:13.720
but we wanna make sure he's all
right. Breaking up is a big thing.

20:13.800 --> 20:16.880
Has it sank in yet?
It hasn't. Even though I am
single...

20:16.960 --> 20:20.800
It seems so weird even saying that.
If there's one bunch of people

20:20.880 --> 20:22.960
that can take my mind off
what I've done,

20:23.040 --> 20:26.560
it's them crazy little fuckers
I live with so bring on tonight.

20:26.640 --> 20:29.520
To be honest with ya,
I just wanna have fun with my mates

20:29.600 --> 20:31.720
and get over the whole thing
I've done.

20:31.800 --> 20:34.840
Let's go out tonight, have fun,
celebrate that I'm single

20:34.920 --> 20:37.320
and enjoy tonight.
The boys are all together,

20:37.400 --> 20:40.640
Marty's playing with his
floppy cock. Tonight'll be wicked.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.800
Fucking go for it!

20:46.080 --> 20:50.840
I am so confused. There is so much
going on in my head right now,

20:50.920 --> 20:53.840
I don't know what to do with myself.
It's been a long time

20:53.920 --> 20:57.960
since me and Gary have been single.
Does this mean he's your Gary again?

20:58.040 --> 21:00.520
(all) He was always -
He was always my Gary!

21:00.600 --> 21:02.560
I am made up that Gary
is not leaving us

21:02.640 --> 21:06.320
and I know it means even more
to Charlotte. I am actually buzzing.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.080
Shall we go downstairs
and get a drink?!

21:12.160 --> 21:14.040
Whoo!
Yes!

21:15.240 --> 21:18.000
To family.To family!
Good to have you back, kid!

21:18.080 --> 21:20.040
(all) Family!
(all cheer)

21:20.120 --> 21:22.000
Now that everyone's together,

21:22.080 --> 21:25.400
we're gonna go out tonight
as a family and go pure radge.

21:28.840 --> 21:30.760
Let's go, motherfuckers!

21:30.840 --> 21:32.560
Let's fucking do it.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.760
It feels fucking amazing to be back.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.920
Let's just do this Geordie style.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.480
(all cheer)

21:41.560 --> 21:43.200
Oi, oi!

21:47.600 --> 21:50.880
The boys are back together
so let's get fucking mortal.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.720
Last night I couldn't get a stiffy
so tonight's mission

21:59.800 --> 22:02.600
is to prove to Chloe that I can.
Please work, mate.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.840
Marty has just told us he likes us.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.600
I'm buzzing.
And I'm not in the friend-zone.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.480
What a belter!

22:19.800 --> 22:23.560
I've lined it all up.
#PrayForAStiffy

22:33.760 --> 22:36.760
I keep looking at Charlotte
and I wanna go and speak to her

22:36.840 --> 22:39.880
but for some reason, I'm nervous.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.880
To be honest, I'm just a little bit
pissed off with Gary.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.000
He hasn't even given us
a second look.

22:52.960 --> 22:56.040
Now Gary's come back and told us
the decision he had to make,

22:56.120 --> 22:58.440
it's making me think even more
about Kyle.

23:03.840 --> 23:07.360
Holly's my best friend but I don't
like the person she turns into

23:07.440 --> 23:11.080
when she's with Kyle and that makes
it so hard to talk about this.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.240
Charlotte might not wanna talk
about this tonight

23:17.320 --> 23:20.680
but it's a massive problem for me
and it's not gonna go away.

23:25.160 --> 23:28.360
Scott is still ignoring us
but what do you expect?

23:28.440 --> 23:30.280
His lad's back in the house.

23:30.360 --> 23:33.920
I wanna clear the air with Chantelle
but tonight it's all about Gary

23:34.000 --> 23:37.120
so to avoid kick-offs,
I'll just chat with her tomorrow.

23:44.560 --> 23:46.240
To be honest, I do still like him

23:46.320 --> 23:48.680
but I don't wanna be
made a mug of again.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.920
Hearing what Marnie's saying
does make us feel better

23:55.000 --> 23:58.600
but Scott is still ignoring us
so I don't know what to think.

24:04.600 --> 24:08.000
I still haven't spoke to Charlotte
since I came back single.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.080
I feel awkward.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.400
I can see Gary and Charlotte talking
and they're getting closer.

24:16.480 --> 24:20.000
I know what this means. History
might be about to repeat itself.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.760
How can Gary be nervous around me?

24:24.840 --> 24:27.120
We've known each other
for five years.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.320
We've practically grown up together.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.840
Like, I'm sure I've licked
his arsehole.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.720
This is a hard, weird time for me.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.400
I'm just buzzing
that Charlotte's there for us.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.680
I think that Gary's trying to say
that he likes us

24:51.760 --> 24:53.560
and this makes us so scared

24:53.640 --> 24:56.320
because I know that
I still like him too.

25:00.640 --> 25:04.240
It's wicked having the family back
together and it's made us realise

25:04.320 --> 25:07.280
how much everyone means to us.
It's also made us realise

25:07.360 --> 25:10.200
there's something I should've done
a long time ago.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
Aaron is taking us on a date.
I am so happy.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.440
By asking us out on a date,
it shows that there's more to this

25:24.520 --> 25:25.920
than just a drunken snog.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.720
I am buzzing.
Ohhhh!

25:36.200 --> 25:38.120
We've all had such a great night.

25:38.200 --> 25:43.320
Now it's time to get back to
the house and carry on the part-ay!

25:55.200 --> 25:58.240
Me and Marty are in the taxi
and I feel like I'm in a movie

25:58.320 --> 26:00.920
but I just can't wait
to take my clothes off!

26:02.600 --> 26:03.880
(Marty giggles)

26:03.960 --> 26:06.920
Why is it always me
that gets stuck in a taxi

26:07.000 --> 26:08.840
with the horny fucking bastards?

26:12.560 --> 26:15.120
It's quite romantic
if you think about it.

26:16.480 --> 26:17.960
(moaning)

26:18.040 --> 26:21.000
It sounds like this.
(slapping)

26:21.080 --> 26:22.240
(moans)

26:24.840 --> 26:26.680
Where's the chicken nuggets?

26:26.760 --> 26:29.200
We're back in the ken
and Chloe's pure mortal.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.520
(shouts)

26:32.840 --> 26:35.080
Any dick-shaped food
she comes across,

26:35.160 --> 26:37.400
goes straight in her fucking gob.

26:43.080 --> 26:44.480
We've had a wicked night

26:44.560 --> 26:47.680
so me and Marnie are heading
straight to that Shag Pad.

26:52.760 --> 26:56.400
I love getting it on with Aaron but
I'm not gonna go the full way yet,

26:56.480 --> 26:58.920
not until he's taken us
on a really nice date.

26:59.920 --> 27:03.480
I finally get Marnie in the Shag Pad
and all she wants to do is cuddle.

27:03.560 --> 27:07.360
At this rate, I'm gonna have to
rename it the Snuggle Pad.

27:07.440 --> 27:10.400
I am absolutely fucking mortal

27:10.480 --> 27:13.600
and there's only one place
left for me. That's my bed.

27:13.680 --> 27:16.360
No, man.
I want to.

27:16.440 --> 27:19.480
No. All I want to do
is go to fucking sleep

27:19.560 --> 27:23.160
but all Chloe's doing is following
us around like a horny shadow.

27:23.240 --> 27:24.240
Nash on.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.760
Fuck knows what's happening
with Marty.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.560
One minute he's in bed with Chloe

27:29.640 --> 27:33.240
then he's trashing the fucking
bedroom. The kid's lost the plot.

27:34.440 --> 27:36.600
Marty's having a scuff
with the wardrobe

27:36.680 --> 27:39.920
and in all honesty, I think
the wardrobe's just decked him.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.040
Last night his cock didn't work
and tonight none of him works.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.160
What the fuck?

27:58.520 --> 28:02.440
I've woken up to some news
and I'm gonna have to leave.

28:02.520 --> 28:05.920
I've had an absolutely amazing time
in this house

28:06.000 --> 28:07.920
but I need to go.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.040
Good morning, everyone.
Morning.

28:15.120 --> 28:18.480
Morning, Scott! This is the closest
we've been in a while.

28:18.560 --> 28:21.960
We're basically in the same bed!
Why the fuck are you in this room?

28:22.040 --> 28:25.000
Where's Martin?Marty went
fucking berserk last night.

28:25.080 --> 28:28.000
I don't know where he is
but hopefully he's calmed down.

28:28.080 --> 28:31.120
Did you kiss?Obviously.
Did you do anything else?

28:31.200 --> 28:34.040
Yes. Chloe got fingered by Marty
in the taxi. What?!

28:34.120 --> 28:36.440
No, I didn't.
You did, I seen it!

28:36.520 --> 28:39.040
Fingered in a taxi? Shut up, Nathan.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.000
It felt good, though.
(cringes)

28:43.920 --> 28:48.760
Was I dreaming or... did you ask
to take me on a date today?

28:48.840 --> 28:52.080
Today's the day me and Marnie
are going on our first ever date.

28:52.160 --> 28:55.240
It's been a long time coming
and I'm buzzing.What was that?

28:55.320 --> 28:58.720
I did, man. Shut up, you dick.
Maybe if you impress us on this date

28:58.800 --> 29:01.400
we could take our relationship
to the next level.

29:01.480 --> 29:04.000
Aaron taking us on this date
makes us so happy.

29:04.080 --> 29:07.640
This is the type of feeling
I've wanted ever since I walked in.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.320
I've come downstairs
expecting to see Marty

29:13.400 --> 29:15.600
and all I can see
is a message on the board.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.600
Yous!
What?What? What?

29:17.680 --> 29:21.160
Come here, please! Chloe's went
downstairs and it's apparent

29:21.240 --> 29:24.280
there's something up.
What the fuck's going on now? What?

29:24.360 --> 29:26.360
Marty's gone.
What?

29:26.440 --> 29:30.000
"Had to leave at short notice.
Sorry I didn't get to say goodbye.

29:30.080 --> 29:31.960
Marty."
What?

29:32.040 --> 29:33.640
Why would he go?

29:35.040 --> 29:38.760
I'm fucking gutted. It's typical.
As soon as I get close to someone,

29:38.840 --> 29:40.120
something happens.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.360
(all laugh)

29:43.440 --> 29:46.080
I can't understand why he's gone.

29:46.160 --> 29:49.280
Maybe just one floppy cock joke
too many.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.520
(laughter)
Man, it's minging.

29:53.600 --> 29:56.320
I don't, man. I've brushed my teeth
in Listerine.

30:01.320 --> 30:05.240
I've just told the girls that Aaron
has finally asked us out on a date

30:05.320 --> 30:07.080
and they're all buzzing for us.

30:07.160 --> 30:09.240
Aaron, you getting ready
for that date?

30:09.320 --> 30:11.360
Look at her arse.
Her little bum.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.400
By taking Marnie out on this date,

30:13.480 --> 30:15.920
I hope she can see how much
I do really like her.

30:16.920 --> 30:21.160
Fuck, lasses. Getting excited
already? See yous later.(all) Bye!

30:21.240 --> 30:24.400
If I wasn't nervous already,
now I'm even more nervous.

30:24.480 --> 30:28.080
Aaron looks so handsome.They look
so cute together, don't they?

30:28.160 --> 30:31.480
I'm so happy for Marnie because
I know how much she likes Aaron

30:31.560 --> 30:33.520
and they look perfect together.

30:39.400 --> 30:41.320
Aaron's taking us for ice cream.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.720
This date couldn't have started
any better.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.320
I can't believe after what
we've been through

30:46.400 --> 30:48.800
that I'm on a date with you.
Two years later.

30:48.880 --> 30:51.960
Two years later. I literally feel
like such a school girl.

30:52.040 --> 30:54.000
This is the cutest date ever.

30:54.080 --> 30:57.560
Oh, there's waffles and that.
Crepes and that remind me of Greece.

30:57.640 --> 31:01.040
Do they?Which wasn't a good time,
Marns, cos you were engaged.

31:01.120 --> 31:04.200
When she got engaged in Greece,
I thought I had lost her.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.520
But now she's back in my life,
I am buzzing

31:06.600 --> 31:08.800
and I certainly
won't be losing her again.

31:08.880 --> 31:10.440
Aaron.
What?

31:10.520 --> 31:12.760
(laughs)
I'm trying to be sexy.

31:12.840 --> 31:15.880
Is this not what every girl does
on a date?

31:15.960 --> 31:19.480
I'm giving Marnie a sneak peak
of what she could be getting later

31:19.560 --> 31:22.800
if she's lucky.Oh. Aaron,
you've got a good technique there.

31:22.880 --> 31:26.080
I'm getting flutters.
Fanny flutters.Fanny flutters.

31:26.160 --> 31:29.200
I've always liked Aaron but this date
has made us realise

31:29.280 --> 31:31.160
how much I actually do like him.

31:36.280 --> 31:39.080
Tonight's the final night,
which is family night.

31:39.160 --> 31:43.560
Which means no pulling, no arguing.
It's all about family love.

31:43.640 --> 31:46.640
Boys, we started with us four
and we're back to us four.

31:46.720 --> 31:48.480
It kind of feels right.
It does.

31:48.560 --> 31:52.400
So, Aaron. Tonight, mate.
Are you gonna dip the wick?

31:52.480 --> 31:55.000
(all laugh)
Hopefully. We had a good date.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.760
I do think me and Marnie
have got something special

31:57.840 --> 32:01.160
so hopefully tonight
we can take it one step further.

32:01.240 --> 32:04.600
It's the last night and it feels
so nice to be sitting here

32:04.680 --> 32:08.600
with all the girls who I class
as my sisters getting ready together

32:08.680 --> 32:10.360
and all being on good terms.

32:10.440 --> 32:12.880
Tonight's gonna be good,
everyone's friends.

32:12.960 --> 32:15.840
I'm gonna put my chicken hat on
to make us feel better.

32:15.920 --> 32:19.200
I'm gutted Marty's not here.
I know Chloe's missing Martin

32:19.280 --> 32:22.200
so I'm gonna make sure that
she has fun on our last night.

32:22.280 --> 32:26.080
I just wanna say thank you
for welcoming us into the family.

32:26.160 --> 32:27.560
I'm gonna get emotional.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.840
Oh, don't get emotional!

32:29.920 --> 32:33.440
Being accepted into this group
is the most I could've wished for

32:33.520 --> 32:35.840
and I really feel like
part of the family.

32:35.920 --> 32:39.960
I genuinely do love yous and yous
have made us feel so welcome.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.840
I know me and Chantelle
haven't always seen eye to eye

32:42.920 --> 32:46.320
but she's great and this family
wouldn't be the same without her.

32:46.400 --> 32:47.520
(all cheer)

32:47.600 --> 32:48.840
Last night!

32:51.080 --> 32:54.120
Party squad. We've had
arguments, fights, kick-offs

32:54.200 --> 32:56.520
but we always pull through
so let's go out

32:56.600 --> 32:59.000
and have an absolutely amazing
final night.

32:59.080 --> 33:01.520
Let's get fucked up. To the family!
(all cheer)

33:01.600 --> 33:04.600
Everybody's up for tonight,
looking fresh as fuck.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.080
Tonight is gonna go off.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.720
We get into the club,
it's our final night,

33:10.800 --> 33:13.400
the music is bouncing.
It's gonna be a good one.

33:13.480 --> 33:16.080
I fucking love
every single one of yous.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.640
(all cheer)

33:26.920 --> 33:30.080
There's been a big atmosphere
between me and Chantelle

33:30.160 --> 33:33.200
but seeing as it's the last night,
I wanna clear the air.

33:40.880 --> 33:44.400
It's been hard not speaking to Scott
because I do really like him

33:44.480 --> 33:46.480
so his apology means a lot to us.

33:57.320 --> 33:59.400
As it's the last night, fuck it.

33:59.480 --> 34:02.040
Why not? Get over here
and give us a kiss.

34:04.160 --> 34:06.800
Fuck me, Scott and Chantelle
are necking on.

34:06.880 --> 34:09.440
I wasn't expecting that
after all their drama.

34:12.720 --> 34:16.560
I take that as apology accepted.
You've still got it, kid!

34:21.440 --> 34:23.040
(all) One, two, three, lads!

34:23.120 --> 34:26.160
It's the last night
so I'm determined to put my problems

34:26.240 --> 34:29.560
to the back of my mind and
have a good time with the family.

34:32.080 --> 34:35.240
We're all having such a good night,
we're all mortal drunk

34:35.320 --> 34:38.920
and I love being with the family.
Even Holly's having a good time.

34:46.040 --> 34:49.160
Me and Charlotte have always had
a special relationship

34:49.240 --> 34:50.640
but now we're both single,

34:50.720 --> 34:53.480
I'm questioning
how I actually feel about her.

34:58.560 --> 35:02.200
There's always been an obstacle
in our way and now there isn't one.

35:02.280 --> 35:05.080
So what the fuck is going to happen?

35:08.880 --> 35:12.280
I can tell by Charlotte's face,
she's also a little bit nervous

35:12.360 --> 35:15.120
but now we're both single,
we're nervous...

35:15.200 --> 35:17.360
but a little bit excited.

35:28.960 --> 35:32.080
Who knows what is gonna happen in
the future with me and Gary

35:32.160 --> 35:33.560
but the one thing I do know

35:33.640 --> 35:37.520
is that my last night
is gonna be spent spooning Gary.

35:40.280 --> 35:44.240
It's been so long since I've been
single, I've forgotten what to do.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.760
(laughs) Have I, fuck.

36:01.480 --> 36:02.480
(guffaws)

36:04.760 --> 36:06.960
Me and Marnie are getting on
really well.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.040
That date definitely done the trick.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.440
Surely tonight has to be the night.

36:17.840 --> 36:20.800
Marnie and Aaron look like
a proper couple tonight

36:20.880 --> 36:24.800
and after all the drama they've been
through, it's about fucking time.

36:30.680 --> 36:33.760
Me and Marnie are both mortal
and we're both falling over.

36:33.840 --> 36:37.440
It's times like these where I know
she's definitely my best friend.

36:38.680 --> 36:42.480
Everyone's having a wicked time.
None of us want this to end

36:42.560 --> 36:45.600
so we've decided to go
and have a walk down the Quayside.

36:46.800 --> 36:51.120
Tonight I was supposed to take Aaron
home for a night of amazing sex.

36:51.200 --> 36:54.560
Instead, Scott is carrying us
out the club.

36:54.640 --> 36:55.640
Great.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.680
We're all having such a laugh

37:00.760 --> 37:03.520
but I can see that Holly's got
something on her mind

37:03.600 --> 37:05.800
so I stayed behind with her
and chatted.

37:05.880 --> 37:08.000
When Gary came back,
it made us realise

37:08.080 --> 37:09.880
I have a massive decision to make.

37:09.960 --> 37:12.440
My relationship with Kyle
means the world to me

37:12.520 --> 37:13.680
but so does my family.

37:13.760 --> 37:16.400
I can't really be in this house
in a relationship

37:16.480 --> 37:19.720
with someone who's on the outside
cos it doesn't ever work.

37:21.160 --> 37:24.080
I'm gonna have to choose
this house or him.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.720
Me and Holly stepped through
that door together on the first day

37:27.800 --> 37:30.000
and we've been best friends
ever since.

37:30.080 --> 37:33.720
You know how much I love ya
and how much I want you to be here

37:33.800 --> 37:36.360
more than anyone else
in the whole entire world.

37:36.440 --> 37:40.360
That girl is not just
my best friend, she is my sister

37:40.440 --> 37:43.800
and seeing her like this
really makes my heart ache.

37:43.880 --> 37:47.440
We all love you so much and we've
all got your best interest at heart.

37:47.520 --> 37:49.640
That's why it's making it so hard.

37:49.720 --> 37:52.160
You're my best friend
and you always will be.

37:52.240 --> 37:55.760
If you are gonna think about this,
please think about it properly.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.240
You promise us you will?
(whispers) Promise.

38:00.320 --> 38:04.080
Charlotte is my best friend and her
being there for me means everything.

38:04.160 --> 38:06.080
We've gone through such a tough time

38:06.160 --> 38:09.280
but I think that just shows
how strong our friendship is.

38:10.280 --> 38:15.000
It's been an absolute amazing night
and I'm gutted it's come to an end.

38:15.080 --> 38:17.720
This is what I call
a fucking family night.Oi, oi.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.600
None of us want tonight to end

38:21.680 --> 38:24.480
and we're feeling
all sentimental and shit.

38:24.560 --> 38:27.960
I've had the best night ever
and there's no place I'd rather be

38:28.040 --> 38:29.600
when I'm single. Back here.

38:29.680 --> 38:32.920
This time around, I made
one of the hardest decisions

38:33.000 --> 38:35.720
I've ever had to make
but standing here right now,

38:35.800 --> 38:38.080
I know I made the right decision.

38:38.160 --> 38:41.040
All I'm gonna say
is how much I love all of yous.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.840
(all) Yeah!
I wouldn't be anything without yous.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.920
I wasn't here from the start
but I'm so happy to be back.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.760
I'm so lucky to have
this big fucked up family.

38:49.840 --> 38:52.760
When I say "fam," you say "ily".

38:52.840 --> 38:54.160
Fam....
(all) ...ily!

38:54.240 --> 38:55.440
Fam...
(all) ...ily!

38:55.520 --> 38:58.040
This time there's been
more kick-offs than ever

38:58.120 --> 39:00.800

at the end. We're family

39:00.880 --> 39:04.320

to me. I fucking love all of yous!

39:04.400 --> 39:07.120

39:10.640 --> 39:12.800

39:12.880 --> 39:15.160

39:49.880 --> 39:52.960

39:58.200 --> 40:02.480
I wouldn't change it
for the fucking world.(all cheer)

40:14.800 --> 40:18.080
It gets harder and harder
to say bye to these little radgies

40:18.160 --> 40:21.400
but I know, at the end of the day,
we're such a strong family.

40:23.720 --> 40:26.000
We might be a bunch
of absolute nut-cases

40:26.080 --> 40:29.040
but we're a family and
I absolutely love them to bits.

40:30.560 --> 40:34.160
It's time to go and I'm feeling like
an absolute emotional wreck.

40:34.240 --> 40:35.880
This is so hard.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.360
But I've gained a family
who I love to bits.

40:38.440 --> 40:40.280
Agh. Bye!
Bye!

40:40.360 --> 40:43.440
This time around has literally been
fucking amazing.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.880
Bye, Aaron. See yas.
Bye, I love you.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.600
(all) Aw!
(Marnie giggles)

40:48.680 --> 40:51.840
The thing is, with me and Aaron,
we're never off the table.

40:51.920 --> 40:55.360
This could be it. I wanna be
with him.Bye, everyone! Love yous!

40:55.440 --> 40:58.840
Leaving the house, we're all in
a good place. I remained faithful

40:58.920 --> 41:02.800
and I've had a fucking wicked time.
(honks horn) Bye, everyone!

41:02.880 --> 41:03.880
I love yous.

41:03.960 --> 41:07.720
I'm leaving this house knowing that
I've gotta make a massive decision.

41:07.800 --> 41:09.440
It's the family or Kyle.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.560
It's just us. Again.

41:13.640 --> 41:16.360

41:16.440 --> 41:18.760

cos it's a bit more than that.

41:18.840 --> 41:20.200
Well, is it?

41:21.200 --> 41:23.760
We'll see how it goes.
We're both single now.

41:23.840 --> 41:26.800
Let's make a pact, right?

41:26.880 --> 41:29.400
I promise you I'll be single
the next time.

41:29.480 --> 41:31.680
Right. And I promise you
I'll be single.

41:31.760 --> 41:35.960
Cos I think I would like...
to see the parsnip again.

41:36.040 --> 41:39.240
(both laugh) I'm getting that rabbit.
Shit. The rabbits.

41:39.320 --> 41:42.560
Me and Gary are leaving this house
more than just friends

41:42.640 --> 41:45.520
and we've promised
we're gonna come back in single.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.600
You get Charlotte and I'll get Gary.

41:47.680 --> 41:50.600
So I suppose...

41:50.680 --> 41:51.680

41:57.560 --> 41:59.560

42:04.880 --> 42:08.640
"Guys, it's Anna.

back to his house A-S-A-P."

42:14.040 --> 42:15.480
# Everyone's here to party

42:15.560 --> 42:17.640
# If you wanna go wild
You wanna go wild

42:17.720 --> 42:19.160
# Everyone's here to party

42:19.240 --> 42:21.400
# If you wanna go wild

42:21.480 --> 42:22.920
# Everyone's here to party

42:23.000 --> 42:25.080
