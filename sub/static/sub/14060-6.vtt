show me around.

About
billy hamilton.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.493
What?

01:01.495 --> 01:02.795
I heard it from

01:02.797 --> 01:04.596
His previous employer,
according to him.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.632
They've never heard of him.

01:08.268 --> 01:09.468
I know he's led
a difficult life,

01:09.470 --> 01:11.770
So he may have...
Embellished a bit.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.305

there's an explanation.

01:13.307 --> 01:14.573
Yes.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.475
There is an explanation,

01:16.477 --> 01:17.576
He's not the man

01:17.578 --> 01:19.211
You think he is.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.513
At best,
he misrepresented himself.

01:21.515 --> 01:22.581
At worst,

01:22.583 --> 01:25.317
He's a con man.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.453
Did you check into everyone's
employment history,

01:27.455 --> 01:28.387
Or just billy's?

01:30.323 --> 01:32.357
You singled him
out, jack.

01:32.359 --> 01:34.493
Why did you do that?

01:34.495 --> 01:36.695
Because, elizabeth,
I'm just trying to protect you.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.330
I don't want
your protection.

walk me home?

I think
it's just a false alarm.

I just don't understand

seven months,

And yet be so huge.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.303
I'm in for the arm-wrassle
and the hatchet-throw.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.137
How about you gents?

11:46.139 --> 11:47.372
Hatchet throw?

11:47.374 --> 11:48.840
I ain't going
anywhere near that.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.042
You can't hit
the side of a barn.

11:51.044 --> 11:51.976
[laughter]

11:53.779 --> 11:56.815
Shut up and sign,
harold.

12:00.821 --> 12:04.355
This crime spree
makes me nervous, constable.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.924
Until this bunch
showed up,

12:05.926 --> 12:07.292
Only thing ever disappeared
around this town

12:07.294 --> 12:09.894
Is a licorice stick
from the mercantile.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.230
My thoughts exactly.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.901
Whiskey,
please.

12:25.277 --> 12:27.312
This round's on me.

12:27.314 --> 12:31.282
Right nice of you,
constable.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.051
To coal valley.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.321
Coal valley.

12:42.828 --> 12:44.529
You're not sitting in
on a poker game?

12:44.531 --> 12:46.798
I figured you for a gambler.

12:46.800 --> 12:50.869
I just gamble
other things besides cards.

12:52.238 --> 12:54.506
Handsome watch.

12:54.508 --> 12:57.942
I noticed it wasn't
your monogram, though.

12:59.979 --> 13:02.046
It was my mother's father's.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.015
My only inheritance.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.417
Well, that and my smile.

13:09.021 --> 13:12.023
Best keep that inheritance
close to your vest.

13:12.025 --> 13:15.293
Our thief has been taking
family mementoes.

13:17.062 --> 13:20.298
You know, I'm sure
you're concerned about me, jack,

13:20.300 --> 13:22.901
But we're interested in
the same woman.

13:24.069 --> 13:25.937
Now, you might think

13:25.939 --> 13:28.206
That red serge jacket
intimidates me,

13:28.208 --> 13:30.875
But it doesn't.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.377
When it comes to
elizabeth thatcher,

13:32.379 --> 13:36.014
I'm gonna steal her heart.

13:40.953 --> 13:43.321
Hope you find
your bad guy.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.422
I will.

13:46.425 --> 13:49.460
It's only a matter of time.

13:50.296 --> 13:54.098
Oh, no, no, no...

14:06.011 --> 14:08.313
Your cake for Saturday?

14:10.416 --> 14:12.116
Baking takes practice.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.384
Good.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.919
Then I'll be ready
for the cake auction

14:14.921 --> 14:17.288
In... Two years?

14:17.290 --> 14:19.023
Now, now, you wouldn't let
your students quit,

14:19.025 --> 14:21.025
And I'm not going
to let you quit.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.395
Why don't I just stay here
with carla

14:24.397 --> 14:26.331
And you can go
to the miners' games?

14:26.333 --> 14:28.433
Because you've
never been before.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.435
And besides, you shouldn't
be hiding from jack.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.237
I'm not.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.304
Why would you
say that?

14:33.306 --> 14:36.608
When two people have
feelings for each other.

14:36.610 --> 14:39.410
Jack and I are just friends.

14:39.412 --> 14:43.214
Besides, he's a confirmed
bachelor anyhow.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.316
No, he's a confirmed mountie.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.452
Duty and honor,

14:47.454 --> 14:49.254
Until the right woman
comes along.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.356
I don't know about that,

14:51.358 --> 14:53.625
But he has been
acting strange lately.

14:53.627 --> 14:55.059
One moment,
he's interrogating me,

14:55.061 --> 14:56.961
And the next, he's...

14:56.963 --> 14:59.130
I don't even know
how to describe it.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.398
Sweet like honey?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.333
Yes. How did you know?

15:02.335 --> 15:03.534
Never mind that.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.536
All I know is
I would be flattered

15:05.538 --> 15:06.938
To have someone
going to extra lengths

15:06.940 --> 15:08.439
To watch over me.

15:08.441 --> 15:11.276
Gently, on the rim
of the bowl.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.210
I'm not
a complete beginner.

15:18.150 --> 15:20.351
[laughing]

15:25.024 --> 15:27.558
[gentle knock on door]

15:34.233 --> 15:36.067
Constable, come in.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.368
Thanks.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.336
Are your children
asleep?

15:38.338 --> 15:39.504
Of course.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.039
You know
what time it is.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.274
Yeah. I'm sorry.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.375
I'm wondering
if I could see

15:44.377 --> 15:46.978
Your grandmother's
brooch again.

15:56.488 --> 15:57.355
[sighs in relief]

16:04.330 --> 16:06.230
It's perfect.

16:06.232 --> 16:07.465
For what?

16:07.467 --> 16:10.168
For nabbing a thief.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.337
I need you
to wear this tomorrow.

16:14.506 --> 16:17.075
Will you help me?

16:25.284 --> 16:26.484
[elizabeth writes]

Caleb!

16:54.347 --> 16:55.613
What?

16:55.615 --> 16:57.015
Try a knuckleball.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.517
You know how to throw
a knuckler?

16:59.519 --> 17:00.551
I do all right.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.453
Show me.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.622
Since he's the one
who's pitching,

17:04.624 --> 17:06.324
But everybody
can watch.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.092
Hey! He knows how to
throw a knuckler!

17:10.429 --> 17:11.496
Okay..

17:11.498 --> 17:13.464
The grip is
half the battle.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.600
See, the fingers,
see where they are?

17:15.602 --> 17:17.602
Knuckles on the seams.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.773
Here, try it.

17:21.775 --> 17:25.109
Fingers here,
knuckles on the seams.

17:26.345 --> 17:28.212
Now, this thing--

17:28.214 --> 17:31.416
This will dance
a two-stepper.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.617
You want to
give it a try?

17:32.619 --> 17:33.684
Yeah.

17:36.588 --> 17:39.390
Okay, ephraim,
your mommy's right over here.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.491
Let's go say hi.

17:40.493 --> 17:41.559
Have a good time

17:41.561 --> 17:43.327
At the games, ephraim.

17:43.329 --> 17:44.629
I'm gonna eat
three funnel cakes!

17:44.631 --> 17:46.664
You eat one for me.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.233
You listen to mrs. Blakeley
about sweets.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.568
Yes, mama.

17:51.503 --> 17:54.205
Give me a kiss.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.443
Mrs. Blakeley's waiting
outside for you.

17:58.445 --> 18:01.079
[sobbing] what if
something happens to me?

18:01.081 --> 18:02.580
Carla, don't think like that.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.581
You have to stay calm.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.349
Stay calm for this baby.

18:05.351 --> 18:06.517
Everything's going to be fine.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.188
Stay calm.

18:11.256 --> 18:14.625
[applause and cheers]

18:14.627 --> 18:16.627
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:16.629 --> 18:18.129
It is my great pleasure,

18:18.131 --> 18:20.531
On behalf of the pacific
northwest mining company,

18:20.533 --> 18:21.532
To welcome you

18:21.534 --> 18:24.268
To the annual miners' games.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.838
[cheering and applause]

18:26.840 --> 18:28.673
Today, we celebrate
the re-opening,

18:28.675 --> 18:30.174
At full capacity,

18:30.176 --> 18:32.176
Of our mine.

18:32.178 --> 18:33.778
[cheering and applause]

18:33.780 --> 18:35.279
So without further ado,

18:35.281 --> 18:37.348
For you who work so hard,

18:37.350 --> 18:39.617
Now it's time for you
to play hard, too.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.652
Let the games begin!

18:41.654 --> 18:42.587
[cheering and applause]

18:42.589 --> 18:44.388
Well said, sir.

18:44.390 --> 18:45.356
[chuckling warmly]

18:47.226 --> 18:49.293
[laughter and cheers]

18:52.297 --> 18:53.564
All right,

18:53.566 --> 18:54.632
Let's line up
for the egg toss.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.134
I hear the trick is,

18:56.136 --> 18:58.436
Your hand has to give
when you catch the egg.

18:59.905 --> 19:02.373
It's just
for fathers and sons.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.408
No, that's not what he said.

19:04.410 --> 19:07.145
He said "boys and men."

19:07.147 --> 19:09.147
How about you and me
give it a try?

19:10.517 --> 19:14.519
You're a pitcher,
I bet you'd be good at it.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.300
[applause]

19:30.235 --> 19:32.770
Okay, step back,
give 'em another toss.

19:38.410 --> 19:39.510
[applause]

19:43.782 --> 19:45.449
Okay, son, are you ready?

19:45.451 --> 19:47.251
Look at me,
get ready.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.557
Nice catch, caleb.

19:54.793 --> 19:56.594
I wasn't ready.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.563
I'm sorry, caleb.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.231
I should have...
I should have waited.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.768
Okay, give 'em
another toss...

20:03.770 --> 20:05.303
[applause]

20:06.738 --> 20:09.640
First, fellas, we have
mrs. Florence blakeley

20:09.642 --> 20:11.909
And her famous red velvet cake.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.845
Now, let us dig deep
for these bids.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.280
This is for a good cause,

20:16.282 --> 20:18.683
New encyclopedias
for the school.

20:18.685 --> 20:21.252
We will start the bidding
at two bits.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.853
Two bits!

20:22.855 --> 20:24.422
Oh! Aren't you
an eager bidder.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.390
We have two bits.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.658
Uh, 35 cents.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.493
And we have 35 cents.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.330
50 cents.

20:32.332 --> 20:32.763
We have--

20:32.765 --> 20:34.565
55 cents.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.634
60 cents!

20:36.636 --> 20:38.469
[clearing throat]
80 cents.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.570
Wow...

20:39.572 --> 20:41.672
Goodness.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.441
I don't suppose
I hear 85 cents?

20:46.812 --> 20:49.747
Going once,
going twice...

20:49.749 --> 20:52.550
Sold to the man
with all the money for 80 cents!

20:52.552 --> 20:54.785
[applause]

20:56.288 --> 20:57.388
My pleasure.

21:02.494 --> 21:03.694
Mm!

21:03.696 --> 21:04.895
And next up,

21:04.897 --> 21:07.331
We have
a new addition

21:07.333 --> 21:08.599
To our cake auction.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.636
Our teacher,
miss thatcher.

21:13.338 --> 21:15.539
Go ahead.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.347
[muffled laughter]

21:27.686 --> 21:30.421
Okay.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.889
$1.00.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.391
Oh, you don't have to do--

21:33.393 --> 21:34.458
1.25.

21:35.727 --> 21:36.727
[billy]: 1.35.

21:36.729 --> 21:39.463
[jack]: 1.50.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.632
1.75

21:41.634 --> 21:42.500
$2.00!

21:42.502 --> 21:43.501
2.25

21:43.503 --> 21:44.702
[jack]: 2.50.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.604
[billy] 2.70.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.906
Two...

21:48.908 --> 21:51.642
2.75.

21:53.712 --> 21:56.981
$3.00.

22:01.019 --> 22:03.654
Three bucks,
and the cake is mine.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.723
Sold.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.525
$3.00.

22:07.527 --> 22:10.528
[applause]

22:16.635 --> 22:17.902
May I have a word
with you, please?

22:27.913 --> 22:30.448
Why were you fighting over
my pathetic little cake?

22:30.450 --> 22:31.615
You completely embarrassed me.

22:31.617 --> 22:33.718
We were
supporting you.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.754
Raising funds
for a good cause.

22:38.490 --> 22:41.058
I apologize
for embarrassing you,

22:41.060 --> 22:43.861
But, uh, I think you're
underestimating your cake.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.930
It looks delicious.

22:45.932 --> 22:49.600
Stop lying.

22:51.803 --> 22:53.637
Yes, ma'am.

22:55.741 --> 22:56.841
And you...

22:57.943 --> 23:00.044
Stop with all the smiling.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.912
What game are you playing, jack?

23:01.914 --> 23:04.081
I'm just doing my job.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.549
Protect and serve, that's all.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.752
By bidding on a cake?

23:07.754 --> 23:10.421
Whatever it takes.

23:16.628 --> 23:18.162
Hey, jack!

23:18.164 --> 23:19.864
We've got a problem,
we need your help.

23:19.866 --> 23:21.565
Yeah.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.934
You any good
at tug-of-war?

23:23.936 --> 23:25.436
[chuckling]

23:25.438 --> 23:27.037
Okay, fellas!

23:29.174 --> 23:30.941
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey,
he can't compete.

23:30.943 --> 23:31.942
He's not a miner!

23:31.944 --> 23:34.645
Since you're the one
who hurt ernie jacobs,

23:34.647 --> 23:38.115
How about you sit out,
then the teams will be even.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.650
Let the constable compete.

23:39.652 --> 23:40.918
That way,
we can have our contest

23:40.920 --> 23:42.720
And still get our victory.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.855
I won that arm-wrasslin'
fair and square!

23:44.857 --> 23:46.857
By breaking ernie's wrist.

23:46.859 --> 23:47.958
What a lug.

23:52.564 --> 23:54.465
[sam]: Are we going
to do this or what?

23:54.467 --> 23:55.466
Oh, we're
going to do this.

23:58.837 --> 24:00.538
Ready?

24:00.540 --> 24:02.540
You ready? Go!

24:02.542 --> 24:03.908
[groaning and straining]

24:03.910 --> 24:05.943
[cheering and applause]

24:10.749 --> 24:13.451
[roaring]

24:15.821 --> 24:18.589
[cheering]

24:23.995 --> 24:24.795
Come on, bite in.

24:24.797 --> 24:25.830
Bite in!

24:25.832 --> 24:27.598
[roaring]

24:32.771 --> 24:34.104
Come on, red!

24:36.708 --> 24:38.142
Come on, blue!

24:40.579 --> 24:41.912
[crowd cheering]

24:41.914 --> 24:43.581
Oh, my goodness!

24:47.686 --> 24:49.653
[cheering and laughter]

24:49.655 --> 24:52.122
[roaring in triumph]

24:53.058 --> 24:54.091
You okay?

24:54.093 --> 24:56.160
[dewitt laughs] ah...

24:57.729 --> 25:01.599
-Congratulations.
-Thank you there, mr. Gowan.

25:01.601 --> 25:02.533
Are you hurt?

25:02.535 --> 25:03.801
I'm okay.

25:03.803 --> 25:04.935
Excuse me, sir.
Hi. I'm caleb.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.537
You were amazing
out there.

25:06.539 --> 25:08.739
Thank you, caleb.

25:10.575 --> 25:14.545
Yeah, the red team
was better anyways.

25:14.547 --> 25:16.113
Caleb!

25:16.115 --> 25:17.114
You were wonderful.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.749
Well, I wouldn't
say wonderful.

25:18.751 --> 25:22.686
Well, so much
for honey.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.054
You and me both.

25:24.056 --> 25:25.723
Caleb...

25:26.725 --> 25:27.892
Caleb.

25:27.894 --> 25:29.093
You can't make me like him.

25:29.095 --> 25:31.629
Being rude and disrespectful
to mr. Graves

25:31.631 --> 25:33.898
Is not going to
make you feel any better.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.599
He won't leave me alone.

25:35.601 --> 25:37.101
Tell him to leave me alone.

25:38.637 --> 25:40.771
If that's what you want,
then I will.

25:56.721 --> 25:57.922
Do you miss home?

25:57.924 --> 25:59.223
Sometimes,

25:59.225 --> 26:01.158
But on a day like today,
how could I?

26:01.160 --> 26:01.959
I love it here.

26:01.961 --> 26:05.062
Well...

26:05.064 --> 26:10.000
Whether you're out there,
exploring the wide world,

26:10.002 --> 26:11.335
Or here,

26:11.337 --> 26:13.170
Filling young hearts
and minds

26:13.172 --> 26:14.972
With great
and noble thoughts--

26:14.974 --> 26:16.840
I hope to be with you,
in your life.

26:16.842 --> 26:19.777
Me, too.

26:21.814 --> 26:26.016
That I never considered myself
the marrying type

26:26.018 --> 26:27.151
Until now.

26:27.153 --> 26:30.621
You're the type of woman

26:30.623 --> 26:33.824
I can see myself
settling down with,

26:33.826 --> 26:35.326
Starting a family with.

26:35.328 --> 26:39.063
And we can move as fast
or as slowly as you'd like.

26:39.065 --> 26:42.132
Thank you.

26:45.971 --> 26:47.838
Well, I won't
overstay my welcome.

26:47.840 --> 26:48.939
Oh, no, no, no.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.140
I wasn't...

26:50.142 --> 26:52.176
I wasn't chasing you away.

26:52.178 --> 26:54.645
I'm sure abigail
has a pot of tea brewing.

26:57.816 --> 27:00.718
No, I want to treat you
with the utmost respect,

27:00.720 --> 27:02.119
So I'll be
a better gentleman

27:02.121 --> 27:04.288
Than I've been all day

27:04.290 --> 27:06.790
And say good evening.

27:15.100 --> 27:15.966
[elizabeth sighs]

[elizabeth writes]: Yet so much

What is going on?

28:40.820 --> 28:41.885
What's the ruckus?

28:41.887 --> 28:42.986
The constable and I
set a trap

28:42.988 --> 28:44.121
For the thief.

28:44.123 --> 28:46.990
That billy hamilton
has been the thief all along.

28:46.992 --> 28:48.058
What?

28:48.060 --> 28:49.893
[groaning and choking]

28:51.863 --> 28:53.297
That's not billy.

28:53.299 --> 28:54.898
Sam!

28:54.900 --> 28:57.301
What's going on here?

28:57.303 --> 28:59.770
Thank you for your cooperation,
mrs. Montgomery.

29:00.939 --> 29:02.506
Cat..?

29:02.508 --> 29:06.410
I wore my brooch to the games
to try and lure the thief here.

29:06.412 --> 29:09.179
We thought it might be him.

29:10.882 --> 29:14.218
You-you thought
billy hamilton was me?

29:14.220 --> 29:15.986
[laughs]

29:15.988 --> 29:16.920
That's a joke.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.455
Shut up.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.090
[elizabeth]: You think
that little of him?

29:20.092 --> 29:22.059
Of me?

29:24.229 --> 29:26.864
And you say he's not the man
I think he is.

29:31.236 --> 29:33.370
[laughing]

29:35.240 --> 29:37.908
Carla...

29:40.145 --> 29:41.378
Carla, honey,
go back inside.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.846
Everything's all right.

29:42.848 --> 29:44.381
No, it's not.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.450
My water broke.

30:08.406 --> 30:12.276
I want to apologize
to you, caleb.

30:13.912 --> 30:17.214
I've been playing
pretend father,

30:17.216 --> 30:19.082
And I...

30:19.084 --> 30:21.018
I think we both can agree that
that that's a bust

30:21.020 --> 30:23.821
Because I have no idea
how to do that.

30:28.193 --> 30:31.361
Truth be told,

30:31.363 --> 30:33.030
I envy you.

30:35.466 --> 30:36.400
Because from
everything I've seen,

30:36.402 --> 30:41.205
You had a great, great pa.

30:41.207 --> 30:43.540
And I didn't.

30:43.542 --> 30:47.444
In fact, I never even
met my father.

30:47.446 --> 30:50.914
He walked out on my ma
when I was a toddler.

30:50.916 --> 30:53.050
Really?

30:53.052 --> 30:56.486
It was because of
something that I did wrong,

30:56.488 --> 31:00.224
Even though my ma,
she said it wasn't so.

31:00.226 --> 31:03.360
You know what I used to do?

31:03.362 --> 31:04.962
[chuckles]

31:04.964 --> 31:07.464
I would go off by myself
and I would lie on the ground,

31:07.466 --> 31:09.333
And I would
look up at the clouds,

31:09.335 --> 31:12.269
And I would wonder
if, somehow,

31:12.271 --> 31:15.439
My father was looking up
at those same clouds.

31:15.441 --> 31:20.177
Maybe even a tenth as much
as I was thinking about him.

31:20.179 --> 31:22.179
It broke my ma,

31:22.181 --> 31:24.281
The way
he just left her.

31:24.283 --> 31:26.383
She wasn't strong
and brave like your ma.

31:27.919 --> 31:29.620
She loves you.

31:29.622 --> 31:31.388
You mean
the world to her,

31:31.390 --> 31:33.156
You know that?

31:33.158 --> 31:37.361
And I realize
that you lost your pa,

31:37.363 --> 31:40.264
And I could never
hold a candle to him.

31:46.004 --> 31:47.337
But I'd give my right arm

31:47.339 --> 31:51.041
To have a family
like yours one day.

31:54.312 --> 31:55.445
[carla gasping]

31:55.447 --> 31:57.047
Okay, breathe...

31:57.049 --> 31:58.148
Deep breath.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.149
That's right, carla.
That's it. Breathe.

31:59.151 --> 32:02.519
Elizabeth, can we get
another poultice, please?

32:02.521 --> 32:03.520
That's right, breathe...

32:03.522 --> 32:05.389
[carla gasping in pain]

32:05.391 --> 32:08.592
[abigail hums soothingly]

32:10.061 --> 32:13.463
[abigail humming,
carla wincing in pain]

32:13.465 --> 32:15.132
What is that tune?

32:15.134 --> 32:16.934
It's so beautiful.

32:16.936 --> 32:19.136
Oh, that's "my love
is like a red, red rose."

32:19.138 --> 32:22.272
It's from
a robert burns poem.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.007
You know, we all used to
sing it in school.

32:25.977 --> 32:27.344
Let's get you
back in bed...

32:27.346 --> 32:29.079
[knock on door]

32:33.184 --> 32:34.451
Hi.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.652
How is she doing?

32:35.654 --> 32:37.988
The baby is definitely
coming this time.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.256
Any word

32:39.258 --> 32:40.991
On when the doctor is
getting back to town?

32:40.993 --> 32:42.459
No, not yet.

32:44.562 --> 32:46.396
We're a little
busy in here.

32:46.398 --> 32:47.497
I know,

32:47.499 --> 32:50.100
But I need to
say something to you.

32:52.337 --> 32:53.403
[carla gasping in pain]

32:53.405 --> 32:56.173
Not inside.

33:00.479 --> 33:05.482
The worst sense of timing
in many ways.

33:05.484 --> 33:09.052
I was wrong,

33:09.054 --> 33:11.455
About billy hamilton
being a thief.

33:11.457 --> 33:14.024
Let's not
belabor the obvious.

33:14.026 --> 33:15.025
Please understand,

33:15.027 --> 33:16.059
My main goal,

33:16.061 --> 33:17.494
Even more than
finding the thief,

33:17.496 --> 33:20.364
Was to make sure
you didn't get hurt.

33:21.532 --> 33:25.469
And I did the opposite,

33:25.471 --> 33:27.404
And I will regret that
more than you know.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.274
Your well-being is
all I ever cared about.

33:33.244 --> 33:35.178
I hope you can forgive me.

33:45.056 --> 33:46.356
Caleb?

33:46.358 --> 33:49.226
Mr. Graves.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.494
I invited mr. Graves
over for pie.

33:50.496 --> 33:52.229
Is that okay?

33:52.231 --> 33:53.497
I don't want to be
any trouble, mary.

33:53.499 --> 33:54.698
No, no.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.500
It's no trouble at all.

33:56.502 --> 34:00.170
Um, I have a blackberry
that I kept back from the games.

34:00.172 --> 34:01.471
Or perhaps some shortbread?

34:01.473 --> 34:03.373
You gotta have
the pie, mr. Graves.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.276
No one in coal valley
bakes pie like my mom.

34:06.278 --> 34:07.577
That sounds good.

34:07.579 --> 34:10.313
Real good.

34:10.315 --> 34:12.416
Three pieces of
blackberry pie, coming up.

34:15.486 --> 34:16.420
Okay...

34:20.191 --> 34:21.658
[sighing]

34:21.660 --> 34:24.127
Still no baby?

34:24.129 --> 34:25.328
No.

34:25.330 --> 34:28.432
Abigail's
starting to worry.

34:28.434 --> 34:29.566
I don't know
if I'm cut out

34:29.568 --> 34:31.468
For this country life.

34:31.470 --> 34:32.669
The challenges

34:32.671 --> 34:35.439
And the hardships
these ladies face,

34:35.441 --> 34:38.341
If I'll ever have
the courage they have.

34:38.343 --> 34:42.312
You must miss
your family.

34:42.314 --> 34:43.413
Your life back home.

34:43.415 --> 34:46.583
Your two sisters.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.152
How did you know
I had two sisters?

34:49.154 --> 34:51.621
I never mentioned that.

34:53.591 --> 34:55.325
Sure, you did.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.693
You must have.

34:56.695 --> 34:59.496
Or perhaps
I just assumed

34:59.498 --> 35:02.532
Such a gentle, loving soul

35:02.534 --> 35:06.236
Was surrounded by
female tenderness growing up.

35:06.238 --> 35:10.173
Because you're so cultured
and well mannered.

35:10.175 --> 35:13.410
A red rose
out here in the wild.

35:18.583 --> 35:20.150
"o, my love is like
a red, red rose

35:20.152 --> 35:22.285
That's newly sprung
in June."

35:22.287 --> 35:23.620
"o, my love is
like a melody

35:23.622 --> 35:26.723
That's sweetly played
in tune."

35:26.725 --> 35:28.258
Your beautiful poem.

35:28.260 --> 35:31.328
Written just for you.

35:31.330 --> 35:35.265
Yes, written for me.

35:40.204 --> 35:42.372
May I tell you a secret?

35:42.374 --> 35:46.510
I wish you would.

35:49.747 --> 35:54.384
My father was so against
my becoming a teacher,

35:54.386 --> 35:56.653
That he disinherited me.

35:56.655 --> 36:01.558
My whole family
cut me off.

36:04.195 --> 36:05.262
I had no idea.

36:05.264 --> 36:07.230
It doesn't matter.

36:07.232 --> 36:10.500
That won't hold me back.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.402
My dream,

36:12.404 --> 36:14.337
The one I wouldn't
tell you about before...

36:16.340 --> 36:18.308
Is to travel north,

36:18.310 --> 36:20.477
Where it's
completely wild,

36:20.479 --> 36:22.913
Or to start a mission school
in the far east,

36:22.915 --> 36:25.415
Live among the destitute
and downtrodden,

36:25.417 --> 36:27.751
And raise them up
through education.

36:30.221 --> 36:31.755
Well...

36:31.757 --> 36:36.393
If that's your dream,
then it's mine, too.

36:39.630 --> 36:42.666
You'd go with me,
knowing that I'll never be rich?

36:42.668 --> 36:44.534
[chuckles awkwardly]

36:44.536 --> 36:47.604
I'll go with you.

36:47.606 --> 36:49.472
[sighs]

36:49.474 --> 36:52.742
To find another teacher
to replace me.

36:52.744 --> 36:58.882
I will wait
as long as necessary.

37:11.696 --> 37:14.731
What fine work
you've done, carla.

37:14.733 --> 37:15.799
She's not done yet.

37:15.801 --> 37:17.634
What?

37:17.636 --> 37:19.369
-Focus. Breathe.
-Twins?

37:19.371 --> 37:22.806
[carla gasps
and screams in pain]

37:22.808 --> 37:25.642
Here we go, carla,
here we go!

37:25.644 --> 37:26.843
Oh! Oh, my goodness!

37:26.845 --> 37:27.577
[baby crying]

37:27.579 --> 37:29.779
It's a boy.

37:29.781 --> 37:31.848
[laughing in delight]

37:31.850 --> 37:34.317
[baby crying]

37:34.319 --> 37:37.554
[all laughing in joy]

37:38.823 --> 37:41.691
Carla has been blessed.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.693
We all have.

37:43.695 --> 37:44.661
[babies crying]

37:44.663 --> 37:48.365
[laughing in joy]

37:49.834 --> 37:50.900
So what
tipped you off?

37:52.970 --> 37:56.006
Somehow, he knew
I had two sisters.

37:56.008 --> 38:00.644
It's the one thing
I knew I never told him.

38:00.646 --> 38:03.747
And then your words
came back me,

38:03.749 --> 38:09.853
That he might not be
all he says he is.

38:09.855 --> 38:11.521
That and him stealing
somebody else's poem

38:11.523 --> 38:12.722
And claiming
he wrote it for me, which...

38:12.724 --> 38:16.726
Which really gets my goat.

38:18.329 --> 38:19.629
Jack!

38:19.631 --> 38:23.366
But I think another burglary
might be in the offing.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.874
Go inside.
Let me handle this.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.622
Little late for a ride,
isn't it?

38:45.624 --> 38:47.691
Oh, I'm just, uh...

38:47.693 --> 38:50.794
Taking a look at the stars.

38:50.796 --> 38:52.796
You sure you're not
stealing the horse,

38:52.798 --> 38:54.531
Trying to high-tail it
out of town?

38:54.533 --> 38:55.532
Oh, no, mountie.

38:55.534 --> 38:56.966
I bought this horse.

38:56.968 --> 38:58.635
He's mine, fair and square.

38:58.637 --> 38:59.836
Hamilton,

38:59.838 --> 39:01.371
You haven't done a thing
fair and square

39:01.373 --> 39:03.673
Since you set foot
in coal valley.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.875
Especially the way
you treated elizabeth.

39:05.877 --> 39:08.378
There ain't nothing illegal
about courtin' a pretty girl.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.946
No, you're right.

39:09.948 --> 39:11.648
How about a carpetbagger

39:11.650 --> 39:13.950
Courting a pretty, rich girl
for her family's money?

39:13.952 --> 39:15.785
Well, she'd have to be rich

39:15.787 --> 39:18.488
For you to make
an accusation like that,

39:18.490 --> 39:20.990
And that ain't the case anymore.

39:20.992 --> 39:22.959
I'm not so sure about that.

39:24.628 --> 39:27.497
Why don't you
ask her directly?

39:37.808 --> 39:40.677
It's over, hamilton.

39:42.413 --> 39:44.481
You've got
nowhere to go.

39:45.416 --> 39:45.715
H'yah!

39:45.717 --> 39:46.816
Yah!

40:23.921 --> 40:25.622
They're so tiny,

40:25.624 --> 40:28.057
Like little, fragile
china dolls.

40:28.059 --> 40:29.893
We're very fortunate
they both made it,

40:29.895 --> 40:32.695
Given how early
carla delivered.

40:35.466 --> 40:36.800
How are you doing?

40:38.636 --> 40:42.839
More embarrassed than wounded.

40:42.841 --> 40:45.742
I sent a telegram
to my sister, julie,

40:45.744 --> 40:48.678
And asked her to do
some discreet research.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.780
I didn't want to
alarm my father,

40:50.782 --> 40:54.050
But she discovered billy had
worked at his shipyard

40:54.052 --> 40:55.552
In cape fullerton.

40:56.987 --> 41:00.490
Until he was fired
for stealing.

41:00.492 --> 41:01.558
When?

41:01.560 --> 41:02.659
Right around the time

41:02.661 --> 41:03.827
The society pages
were reporting

41:03.829 --> 41:07.030
That I was heading here.

41:07.032 --> 41:09.866
"rich heiress heads west."

41:09.868 --> 41:11.935
And all that nonsense.

41:11.937 --> 41:15.839
Was that rich heiress
being way smarter than he was.

41:20.077 --> 41:21.511
Jack, I...

41:21.513 --> 41:22.579
Shh.

41:23.647 --> 41:25.648
It's okay.

41:25.650 --> 41:29.486
You don't have to say anything.

41:35.059 --> 41:38.928
[♪]
