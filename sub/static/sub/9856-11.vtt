00:13.110 --> 00:14.510
So you'd just have to, you know,

00:14.710 --> 00:16.510
demonstrate that you
could do your job, and...

00:16.670 --> 00:18.070
they may let you come back.

00:22.470 --> 00:23.470
What's that?

00:24.150 --> 00:25.150
Oh...

00:25.910 --> 00:27.230
something Amanda gave me.

00:27.390 --> 00:28.590
Oh, yeah? Any good?

00:30.510 --> 00:31.630
Yeah, it's...

00:33.190 --> 00:34.710
Ever hear of hand replacement?

00:35.910 --> 00:36.950
I'm sorry?

00:37.830 --> 00:39.950
Hand replacement. You know, uh, bionics.

00:40.910 --> 00:41.910
Yeah, a little.

00:42.070 --> 00:44.510
They're making a lot of strides
in it. This stuff is really...

00:44.790 --> 00:46.030
it's really incredible.

00:46.510 --> 00:47.670
Yeah, but...

00:48.270 --> 00:49.790
your hand isn't missing.

00:51.870 --> 00:53.150
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:53.590 --> 00:55.110
Have you heard anything from Eva?

00:55.350 --> 00:57.070
I was supposed to pick her up this morning.

00:57.190 --> 00:58.510
Is she back from Spain?

00:58.710 --> 00:59.790
Supposed to be.

01:08.950 --> 01:10.950
- Eva?
- Major, I need some time off.

01:11.510 --> 01:12.830
- When?
- Now.

01:14.230 --> 01:15.230
For what?

01:15.790 --> 01:16.870
I can't say.

01:17.230 --> 01:18.230
Can I help?

01:19.270 --> 01:20.270
No.

01:20.870 --> 01:21.870
How long?

01:22.310 --> 01:23.350
I'm not sure.

01:23.710 --> 01:27.070
An unspecified amount of time for
a reason I'm not allowed to know?

01:30.430 --> 01:31.430
Exactly.

01:32.430 --> 01:33.870
How could I say no?

01:34.430 --> 01:35.790
Call me any time.

01:51.350 --> 01:52.710
- Buenos Días.
- Hola.

01:53.230 --> 01:54.670
Un café, por favor.

01:55.750 --> 01:56.750
Gracias.

02:08.350 --> 02:09.350
Hey.

02:09.470 --> 02:11.990
- Eva. Hey, it's Tommy.
- Hi.

02:12.190 --> 02:13.910
- Hey, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

02:14.070 --> 02:15.830
- You sure?
- Yeah.

02:17.270 --> 02:19.350
I just needed some time
on my own, that's all.

02:19.990 --> 02:21.510
I'm okay, Tommy, really.

02:22.190 --> 02:23.190
All right.

02:23.270 --> 02:24.590
All right, I've got to go now.

02:24.990 --> 02:25.990
Okay.

02:26.110 --> 02:27.630
Talk to you soon, okay? Bye-bye.

02:27.950 --> 02:28.990
Take care.

04:06.310 --> 04:07.470
Good evening, Lucien.

04:08.510 --> 04:09.750
Doctor Clarke.

04:10.990 --> 04:12.430
You asked to see me tonight?

04:13.790 --> 04:14.790
Yes.

04:16.510 --> 04:17.510
I've been...

04:19.990 --> 04:22.110
I have been feeling anxious.

04:23.630 --> 04:24.670
Okay.

04:26.110 --> 04:27.550
Well, let's talk about that.

04:28.830 --> 04:30.910
Do you have any idea
what's making you anxious?

04:37.790 --> 04:38.790
Oh!

04:52.910 --> 04:54.470
Alert! Alert!

04:54.670 --> 04:56.590
Internal power outage detected!

04:57.150 --> 04:59.110
- You stay. Keep an eye on them.
- Be careful.

05:05.110 --> 05:06.910
Possible employee down!

05:11.830 --> 05:12.830
Help!

05:13.590 --> 05:14.590
All right.

05:15.150 --> 05:17.590
The doors are not working. Got to use keys.

05:17.790 --> 05:19.190
- Hurry!
- Come on!

05:19.430 --> 05:20.510
- Come on!
- Come on!

05:20.710 --> 05:21.710
Shit!

05:30.310 --> 05:31.310
Come on!

05:32.390 --> 05:33.430
Move, move!

05:34.030 --> 05:35.030
Come on!

06:09.630 --> 06:10.790
Come on! Run. Go.

06:10.910 --> 06:11.910
Move!

06:13.350 --> 06:14.350
Come on!

06:20.830 --> 06:22.390
Jump in! Go!

06:58.790 --> 07:00.550
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

07:00.790 --> 07:03.071
Anybody know what we're doing
here at 1:00 in the morning?

07:03.190 --> 07:05.110
No, but your guess is as good as ours.

07:05.350 --> 07:06.630
I think we're about to find out.

07:06.910 --> 07:08.470
- Good morning.
- Morning.

07:09.150 --> 07:11.190
Could you play that for
me, please, Sebastian?

07:12.310 --> 07:13.870
I regret the early call,

07:14.950 --> 07:17.990
but I believe this to be a
matter of considerable urgency.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.350
That is Lucien Fiori.

07:23.590 --> 07:25.230
He's Corsican national.

07:25.990 --> 07:28.390
He had served four years
of a 30-year sentence

07:28.590 --> 07:30.950
at a maximum security
prison in Lille, France,

07:31.710 --> 07:33.670
and he escaped three hours ago,

07:34.670 --> 07:36.230
taking with him as a hostage

07:36.910 --> 07:38.510
his court-appointed therapist.

07:38.790 --> 07:40.030
It was an intricate,

07:40.550 --> 07:43.030
and a perfectly executed escape.

07:43.670 --> 07:45.110
And as is evident,

07:45.790 --> 07:47.590
he was not acting alone.

07:48.430 --> 07:49.830
That's an understatement.

07:49.990 --> 07:52.590
This is not the only
escape we are interested in.

07:53.070 --> 07:56.910
We also believe that the
same group helped this man.

07:57.790 --> 07:59.470
- Victor Casta.
- Him I know.

07:59.790 --> 08:01.710
He's the best safecracker in Europe.

08:01.990 --> 08:04.710
Well, Casta escaped from a
Czech prison ten days ago.

08:04.910 --> 08:07.270
I heard about that escape.
The prison lost power.

08:07.470 --> 08:10.470
Both prisons suffered
facility-wide electrical failure.

08:11.190 --> 08:14.470
Both had a vehicle filled with
explosives ram their exterior gates

08:14.630 --> 08:15.470
and blow up.

08:15.590 --> 08:17.110
Pretty specific similarities.

08:17.350 --> 08:18.910
They're undoubtedly connected.

08:19.870 --> 08:23.390
I am of the opinion that something
very well planned is about to happen,

08:24.390 --> 08:26.630
and the team should waste
no time finding out what.

08:26.870 --> 08:28.230
We need to be careful on this one.

08:28.430 --> 08:31.430
Casta and Fiori have been
connected to the same criminal gang,

08:31.790 --> 08:32.909
The Radic Group.

08:33.150 --> 08:35.030
Kathrin and I investigated
one of their cells

08:35.230 --> 08:38.429
a few years ago in Berlin.
They're ruthless and professional.

08:38.669 --> 08:41.909
And responsible for
more than 140 robberies.

08:42.270 --> 08:44.270
Are we thinking that the
other members of the group

08:44.310 --> 08:45.510
are behind the prison breaks?

08:45.710 --> 08:46.870
If they are behind this,

08:47.350 --> 08:49.750
then Casta and Fiori broke
out for something big.

08:50.110 --> 08:52.750
Exactly. We must act quickly.

08:55.550 --> 08:56.990
- Louis?
- Yes.

09:01.950 --> 09:02.950
Where's Eva?

09:03.190 --> 09:04.390
Oh, she won't be with us.

09:04.790 --> 09:05.790
Everything all right?

09:06.310 --> 09:07.350
I hope so.

09:16.510 --> 09:17.510
Eva?

09:18.070 --> 09:20.110
- Where are you?
- I'm in Spain.

09:21.470 --> 09:22.790
Are you still with this Mateo?

09:23.030 --> 09:24.190
I'm alone, Sebastian.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.070
Listen, I need your help.

09:26.230 --> 09:27.230
Okay.

09:27.430 --> 09:29.790
If I send you a photo of
someone, can you age it?

09:30.710 --> 09:34.190
Um, yeah, sure, I have
some progression programs.

09:34.670 --> 09:36.790
So you can add a beard,
or things like that?

09:37.150 --> 09:40.350
Yeah, I mean, I'm... I'm no
artist, but, yeah, theoretically.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.430
- Why? What's up?
- All right.

09:42.710 --> 09:44.686
I'm gonna text you a photo
of someone in a little while.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.150
Can you take care of it, please?

09:54.270 --> 09:55.830
- Senorita?
- Yeah?

09:55.990 --> 09:57.430
I'm sorry, but we are closing.

09:58.590 --> 10:00.630
Sure, uh... yeah. Um...

10:01.910 --> 10:03.550
do you mind if I sit here anyway?

10:04.270 --> 10:06.150
We take the tables and chairs inside.

10:06.430 --> 10:07.430
Of course.

10:07.710 --> 10:09.150
Okay. Is that my bill?

10:09.430 --> 10:10.430
Sí, Senorita.

10:12.550 --> 10:14.390
- Wow.
- You have been here all day.

10:14.830 --> 10:15.950
Fair enough.

10:17.910 --> 10:18.950
You can take the rest.

10:19.430 --> 10:20.550
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

10:20.750 --> 10:21.750
Bye.

10:48.870 --> 10:51.230
Major Daniel? Nolan
Duval. I'm the Warden here.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.350
Good morning, Duval.

10:52.430 --> 10:55.910
My team, Seeger, Hickman,
Berger, and McConnell.

10:56.150 --> 10:58.430
We need access to all CCTV footage.

10:59.390 --> 11:02.230
Mr. Dorn already informed
me what your team will need.

11:02.990 --> 11:06.670
You have access to anything that
will help catch that son of a bitch

11:07.150 --> 11:08.670
and bring Anna back.

11:08.870 --> 11:10.550
- Anna?
- Dr. Anna Clarke.

11:10.870 --> 11:11.910
His hostage.

11:12.350 --> 11:13.750
We are at your service.

11:14.110 --> 11:15.310
Thank you very much.

11:16.430 --> 11:18.430
The Court asked for us, so...

11:18.630 --> 11:20.310
I guess they're actually happy we're here.

11:20.670 --> 11:23.390
Way to go, Major. Looks like
your experiment is working.

11:23.630 --> 11:25.550
If this is an experiment,
what does that make us?

11:25.910 --> 11:27.030
Lab rats.

11:30.950 --> 11:32.790
Wait a minute, are you recording this?

11:33.150 --> 11:34.870
Yeah, all the footage from all the cameras.

11:35.030 --> 11:36.990
Great, great, just back it up a little bit?

11:37.750 --> 11:39.070
Why? Do you see something?

11:39.150 --> 11:40.630
I don't know. I don't know, maybe.

11:41.550 --> 11:44.990
Have you experienced this kind
of electrical failure before?

11:45.350 --> 11:46.950
We've had a few problems,

11:47.750 --> 11:48.870
but this?

11:49.390 --> 11:51.910
Entire cells open on their own?

11:53.870 --> 11:54.870
Over...

11:54.910 --> 11:58.830
150 inmates rioting while
we continue to lose control.

12:00.150 --> 12:02.190
That was something we never saw coming.

12:02.350 --> 12:03.350
Arabela?

12:08.390 --> 12:10.270
I get a feeling it was a diversion,

12:10.510 --> 12:12.470
set in motion by an outside source.

12:13.670 --> 12:15.430
I can look into the electrical system,

12:15.630 --> 12:17.470
but I need someone to
set up in the server room

12:17.510 --> 12:18.750
while I go to the control room.

12:18.870 --> 12:20.790
- I can do that.
- You can?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.550
Yeah, sure, no worries.

12:23.550 --> 12:24.750
Maximum destruction.

12:25.110 --> 12:26.350
They knew what they were doing.

12:27.270 --> 12:28.510
Any pieces recovered?

12:28.830 --> 12:29.950
Right over there.

12:31.030 --> 12:32.590
Not everything is tagged yet.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.830
Only what we were able to identify

12:36.430 --> 12:38.150
without microscopic inspection.

12:46.270 --> 12:48.870
Bomber crimped his wiring
with handmade vinyl connectors.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.470
Used an optical transceiver,
but an electrical detonator.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.390
I'm pretty sure it was a plastic bomb.

12:55.710 --> 12:58.510
Well, I'm Sorry, McConnell,
you lost me at "crimped".

12:59.830 --> 13:02.070
I've seen this kind of work
before. It's very specific.

13:02.670 --> 13:03.830
It's Steven Dusek.

13:04.830 --> 13:05.950
The Budapest Bomber?

13:06.390 --> 13:08.790
But he's been in jail since 2009.

13:12.070 --> 13:15.310
The staff at the prison has
not heard from your bomber Dusek

13:15.830 --> 13:17.390
for six months, Tommy.

13:17.790 --> 13:19.390
They let a bomber out on bail?

13:19.670 --> 13:22.630
A very high profile
attorney arranged for it.

13:23.350 --> 13:25.790
A very, very expensive attorney.

13:25.950 --> 13:27.430
I wonder who paid for that.

13:27.630 --> 13:30.190
Now, that, of course, is the
question, is it not, Louis?

13:31.110 --> 13:33.870
Tommy, you are certain that
Dusek is involved in this?

13:34.190 --> 13:36.710
His bomb signature's all over
the fragments recovered here.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.030
I'll bet they match the explosion
at the Ostrava prison as well.

13:40.390 --> 13:43.270
I'll have staff at Ostrava copy
you with the photographs they took

13:43.390 --> 13:44.990
of the fragments they found there.

13:45.230 --> 13:46.230
Thank you, Dorn.

13:47.670 --> 13:50.350
Steven Dusek? That's a proper bad guy.

13:51.510 --> 13:52.510
Yes.

13:53.150 --> 13:55.950
How often did Lucien have therapy
sessions with Doctor Clarke?

13:56.270 --> 13:58.070
Once a week for the last two years.

13:58.230 --> 13:59.670
She never had any trouble with him?

13:59.830 --> 14:02.950
He has a monstrous temper,
but Anna knew how to handle it.

14:03.550 --> 14:05.070
She's the best at what she does.

14:05.270 --> 14:07.790
Brilliant. Youngest PhD ever at Cambridge.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.350
Prisons don't get doctors like her.

14:10.910 --> 14:13.070
- So how'd you get so lucky?
- Jaques Lacan.

14:13.950 --> 14:15.590
Anna's favorite psychoanalyst.

14:16.310 --> 14:18.230
Had it not been for her love of his work,

14:18.910 --> 14:21.190
she never would have chosen France.

14:22.470 --> 14:23.870
Do you think she's still, um...

14:25.190 --> 14:26.510
Until I get proof otherwise,

14:26.670 --> 14:28.670
I'm considering her
very much alive, Warden.

14:29.190 --> 14:30.190
Very much.

14:45.790 --> 14:48.390
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Okay, listen, um...

14:48.910 --> 14:51.110
for me to gain access
to the secure network,

14:52.110 --> 14:54.750
I need you to plug both
the firewire connector

14:55.150 --> 14:56.550
and the remote access plug

14:56.710 --> 14:59.006
into the main server box which
should look something like...

14:59.030 --> 15:00.030
Done.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.390
- I'm sorry?
- It's connected.

15:02.590 --> 15:03.590
Are you sure?

15:04.070 --> 15:05.950
- Main server box, right?
- Yeah.

15:06.550 --> 15:09.190
It's done. I'm an
engineering school drop-out.

15:09.950 --> 15:10.950
What's next?

15:11.870 --> 15:13.390
You mean, besides marrying me?

15:13.870 --> 15:15.430
I've never been into men with baggage,

15:15.670 --> 15:17.470
and I've actually met your baggage, so...

15:17.630 --> 15:18.630
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:18.870 --> 15:20.790
I can follow the hacker's digital footprint

15:21.150 --> 15:22.270
to see how he...

15:24.830 --> 15:26.430
- What, already?
- No.

15:28.190 --> 15:29.190
There's...

15:31.230 --> 15:32.430
absolutely nothing.

15:33.550 --> 15:35.870
This guy managed to delete
any trace of himself.

15:36.150 --> 15:37.910
Is it possible it wasn't hacked?

15:39.590 --> 15:41.590
Two prisons, 1,400 kilometers apart,

15:41.710 --> 15:43.510
experienced the same system failure

15:43.910 --> 15:46.670
at the most opportune time
for both inmates to escape?

15:48.070 --> 15:50.150
This guy is just really good.

15:50.390 --> 15:54.230
Best safecracker, best bomber, best
jewel thief, and now best hacker.

15:54.710 --> 15:55.830
The dream team.

15:56.030 --> 15:57.910
- Yeah, it's like they're...
- Us.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.110
Ready?

16:27.670 --> 16:28.830
Come on, let's go!

16:30.030 --> 16:31.830
Hands in the air! Everybody down!

16:32.190 --> 16:33.190
Get down!

16:33.270 --> 16:34.430
Come on, let's go!

16:35.750 --> 16:36.550
Come on! On the floor!

16:36.710 --> 16:37.710
Come on!

16:39.070 --> 16:40.510
Come on, let's go!

16:41.030 --> 16:43.710
One of them triggered the
alarm. We've got 90 seconds.

16:48.230 --> 16:49.950
I'm going to look for it out in the back.

16:50.350 --> 16:51.750
Mobile phones! Come on!

16:51.910 --> 16:52.910
Get them out!

16:52.990 --> 16:54.550
Come on, show me your mobiles! Come on!

16:56.350 --> 16:57.830
Don't take too much. Hey, hey!

17:00.030 --> 17:01.230
We got a problem here?

17:01.430 --> 17:03.110
No, I cannot find my...

17:09.550 --> 17:10.589
It's not here.

17:10.910 --> 17:12.349
What do you mean it's not here?

17:12.550 --> 17:14.069
How many ways can that be interpreted?

17:14.190 --> 17:15.190
Keep looking!

17:15.589 --> 17:17.030
I searched the whole thing!

17:17.550 --> 17:18.550
Now what?

17:18.710 --> 17:19.710
Now...

17:21.230 --> 17:22.910
- we go.
- Yeah, shit!

17:25.150 --> 17:26.150
All right.

17:26.790 --> 17:27.790
Shit!

17:28.990 --> 17:31.190
- Hey, what are you doing?
- No eye witnesses.

17:31.390 --> 17:33.990
- No! We said only if necessary.
- It is necessary!

17:34.510 --> 17:35.950
I'm never going back to prison.

17:44.916 --> 17:46.916
Three murders? Are we sure it's our guys?

17:47.476 --> 17:49.556
They could easily be in Marseille by now.

17:49.716 --> 17:51.556
True, but they aren't
really killers, are they?

17:51.596 --> 17:52.796
Not according to their sheets.

17:52.916 --> 17:54.212
The only thing about armed robberies

17:54.236 --> 17:56.012
is that you know one's
going to go bad eventually.

17:56.036 --> 17:57.076
Yeah, okay.

17:57.476 --> 18:00.396
So, uh, let's take a closer look
at these guys as individuals.

18:00.596 --> 18:01.596
What do we got?

18:01.716 --> 18:03.076
Dusek, the bomber,

18:03.436 --> 18:05.076
never been linked with The Radics before,

18:05.156 --> 18:07.876
but he is a Hungarian
anarchist, better known for...

18:08.476 --> 18:11.356
political statements
than robbing jewellers.

18:11.636 --> 18:15.396
Safecracker Victor Casta.
First crime he served time for,

18:15.596 --> 18:17.796
robbery of a jewelry wholesaler in Prague.

18:18.036 --> 18:20.317
That's also the first known
collaboration with The Radics.

18:20.596 --> 18:22.236
He could have had his sentence reduced

18:22.436 --> 18:25.556
by informing on them, but he
spat on the prosecutor instead

18:25.756 --> 18:28.036
and received two extra years, in solitary.

18:28.276 --> 18:29.892
Two years in the hole to protect someone?

18:29.916 --> 18:31.196
That's a hell of a calling card.

18:31.516 --> 18:32.516
No kidding.

18:32.716 --> 18:35.076
Lucien Fiori, the other Corsican.

18:35.396 --> 18:39.316
Besides being a world-class jewel
thief, he was in intense therapy

18:39.556 --> 18:42.676
with a renowned psychiatrist
for anger issues.

18:43.996 --> 18:45.796
A psychiatrist who he took hostage,

18:46.316 --> 18:48.516
and who the Warden
clearly has the hots for.

18:50.156 --> 18:52.476
He never called her "doctor".
It was Anna this, Anna that.

18:53.076 --> 18:56.116
Well, every hour that passes, the
less likely we are to find this

18:56.276 --> 18:57.556
Anna alive.

18:57.956 --> 18:59.356
Sebastian, what about the hacker?

18:59.556 --> 19:01.596
I've been through the hard
drives from both prisons,

19:01.676 --> 19:04.796
hoping I missed a trace
of him. Still nothing.

19:05.356 --> 19:08.236
Is a hacker not leaving a
digital footprint that unheard of?

19:09.236 --> 19:11.596
It's less likely than a common
criminal not even leaving

19:11.796 --> 19:14.196
a single trace of DNA at
the crime scene. Unless...

19:14.956 --> 19:15.956
Well, no, that's...

19:16.116 --> 19:17.116
What?

19:18.756 --> 19:20.236
Well, unless it's Ghost Zero.

19:20.356 --> 19:21.396
Is that a real name?

19:21.556 --> 19:23.756
I've always thought that
he was more a myth, but...

19:24.036 --> 19:26.836
he'd theoretically be capable
of this kind of traceless work.

19:27.036 --> 19:29.516
Well, if it's a myth,
why can't he be a she?

19:30.516 --> 19:33.236
Well, the story goes, he

19:33.636 --> 19:37.596
was a computer specialist in
the Swiss Armed Forces until

19:38.876 --> 19:41.396
he was kicked out for hacking
into his own government's secrets.

19:42.396 --> 19:43.716
Whatever he found there

19:43.916 --> 19:45.996
made him never want to work
for the government again.

19:46.276 --> 19:48.276
I will call Dorn. If the story is true,

19:48.516 --> 19:50.876
his contact with the Swiss
military could be helpful.

19:51.116 --> 19:54.036
I can talk to him. I need
to go back to the ICC anyway.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.636
I don't have the right kind of hardware to

19:56.956 --> 19:58.716
find a sophisticated guy like this.

19:58.876 --> 20:02.556
No, I want you to be with us
to check out any CCTV footage

20:03.196 --> 20:04.716
or evidence we may find.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.836
I'll head back to the ICC after
we assess this new crime scene.

20:07.996 --> 20:09.836
I've got a few things
to take care of anyway.

20:10.036 --> 20:11.876
This is not going to be a quick case.

20:12.756 --> 20:13.756
Things?

20:15.396 --> 20:16.676
Yeah, my, um...

20:17.436 --> 20:19.412
hand's been bothering me a little
bit. I've got some new meds.

20:19.436 --> 20:20.436
I've got to get.

20:20.996 --> 20:22.196
But you're okay?

20:23.116 --> 20:25.436
Yup. My hand's not missing, right?

20:28.476 --> 20:29.636
Give me a list?

20:30.876 --> 20:32.916
Yeah, I'll write it down
for you. It's all labelled.

20:33.196 --> 20:36.676
Watch out, Ghost Zero,
Sebastian Berger is on your case.

20:36.916 --> 20:38.316
There's your proof that it's a man.

20:38.636 --> 20:40.596
No woman would ever
call herself Ghost Zero?

20:40.836 --> 20:43.172
She'd call herself "Morning
Potpourri" or something like that.

20:43.196 --> 20:44.876
You're so lucky Eva isn't here.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.236
Yeah. Is that what you were looking for?

21:16.796 --> 21:17.796
I think so.

21:18.116 --> 21:19.116
Who is it?

21:19.916 --> 21:21.036
Who's in the picture?

21:21.276 --> 21:22.476
Uh, I can't tell you now.

21:22.916 --> 21:24.156
Maybe no one. I don't know yet.

21:24.316 --> 21:26.116
Listen, I've got to go now, okay?

21:26.276 --> 21:27.356
Well, maybe I can...

21:27.996 --> 21:30.036
Eva? Eva!

21:30.996 --> 21:31.996
Hola.

21:32.396 --> 21:34.196
- ¿Tu has visto a este hombre?
- No.

21:34.356 --> 21:35.356
¿No?

21:36.396 --> 21:37.396
Gracias.

21:52.876 --> 21:54.276
I'll find the security footage.

21:55.476 --> 21:56.716
They left a mess.

21:57.196 --> 21:58.876
Their mothers would be horrified.

21:59.116 --> 22:01.356
Kind of reminds me of the
prison, maximum destruction.

22:01.556 --> 22:02.756
They are not subtle.

22:02.996 --> 22:04.876
This store isn't very high-end, is it?

22:06.156 --> 22:09.516
Normally it displays less
than 100,000 Euros of jewelry.

22:09.796 --> 22:12.036
The Radics don't move for less than five.

22:12.596 --> 22:13.956
I'm Inspector Fabre.

22:14.196 --> 22:16.676
Ah. We spoke on the phone. Yes.

22:17.116 --> 22:18.916
- Detective Hickman.
- How much was taken?

22:19.196 --> 22:21.516
The owner won't be able
to complete an inventory

22:21.836 --> 22:24.076
until we finish and he
can start cleaning up.

22:24.596 --> 22:27.476
This feels more like an amateur
smash-and-grab gone wrong

22:27.716 --> 22:29.116
than a proper, professional heist.

22:29.316 --> 22:33.236
Yeah, except local thugs don't hack
seven digit electronic security codes

22:33.436 --> 22:35.276
- in a matter of seconds.
- What do you mean?

22:35.556 --> 22:37.396
Well, they got into the security room

22:37.796 --> 22:40.676
and fried all the surveillance
footage from inside the system.

22:41.156 --> 22:42.996
All right, so we got no cameras inside,

22:43.236 --> 22:45.156
but what about footage from street cameras?

22:45.276 --> 22:46.676
We are collecting that now.

22:46.876 --> 22:48.676
Are you looking for
something in particular?

22:48.836 --> 22:51.436
Well, if all three victims were
shot in the middle of the store,

22:51.636 --> 22:53.876
why didn't it attract the
attention of anyone out there?

22:54.156 --> 22:55.916
- Maybe they blocked the window.
- Maybe.

22:56.316 --> 22:58.396
Major, there's something else.

22:58.956 --> 23:02.196
The safe is back there, but
it appears they left it alone.

23:02.436 --> 23:04.596
They're moving with the
best safecracker in the EU,

23:04.756 --> 23:05.956
and they don't touch the safe?

23:06.076 --> 23:07.412
Ever get the feeling
you're playing checkers,

23:07.436 --> 23:08.772
and the other guy's playing chess?

23:08.796 --> 23:09.796
Most days.

23:11.396 --> 23:12.396
Louis...

23:13.236 --> 23:14.892
I've got to take off. I'm going to go back,

23:14.916 --> 23:16.372
I'm going to get Sebastian's equipment.

23:16.396 --> 23:18.532
It looks like we're going to
need all the tech that we have.

23:18.556 --> 23:19.556
Okay.

23:21.236 --> 23:22.436
You are certain,

23:23.196 --> 23:25.236
absolutely certain?

23:28.636 --> 23:29.636
I see.

23:30.476 --> 23:31.756
I see.

23:32.676 --> 23:33.916
Thank you, Roger.

23:34.756 --> 23:35.876
Widerluege.

23:48.196 --> 23:49.196
Yes, Dorn?

23:49.356 --> 23:51.276
How is it going down there, Louis?

23:52.076 --> 23:53.756
I wish I could say great, but...

23:54.236 --> 23:55.436
we are working on it.

23:55.956 --> 23:59.196
I just had a chat with
an old friend of mine,

24:00.036 --> 24:02.356
a Brigadier General in the Swiss Army.

24:02.476 --> 24:04.316
Did he confirm the story about the hacker?

24:04.436 --> 24:06.996
- Oh, no, absolutely not.
- I don't understand.

24:07.596 --> 24:09.676
Well, he responded far too quickly,

24:10.316 --> 24:11.996
far too adamantly.

24:12.396 --> 24:13.476
He was lying?

24:13.916 --> 24:16.196
No. Generals never lie.

24:17.076 --> 24:21.076
They obfuscate, and
complicate, and confound, and...

24:21.316 --> 24:24.476
befog, but they never, ever lie.

24:26.316 --> 24:27.676
That being said,

24:28.836 --> 24:32.476
you can rest assured that
Sebastian's mythical Swiss hacker

24:33.716 --> 24:35.436
is as real as they come.

24:36.596 --> 24:37.596
You're sure?

24:37.956 --> 24:39.116
Dead sure.

24:39.996 --> 24:42.956
My friend will call me later
on a secure line to confirm it.

24:43.996 --> 24:44.996
Thank you.

24:49.276 --> 24:50.516
Perdone, Señor.

24:50.796 --> 24:52.116
¿Conoce a este hombre?

24:53.956 --> 24:55.116
¿Estás seguro?

24:56.476 --> 24:57.476
Gracias.

25:14.676 --> 25:16.276
- Eva?
- Dorn?

25:17.516 --> 25:19.116
I was hoping to catch one of the team.

25:19.356 --> 25:21.996
No, they're in Marseille
investigating a robbery-homicide

25:22.196 --> 25:23.556
at a jewellery store.

25:23.996 --> 25:25.116
Can I be of help?

25:25.316 --> 25:28.916
Uh, no, no, sir. It's okay. I'm gonna
call the Major's cell. Thank you.

25:29.196 --> 25:30.836
You're all right, though, yes?

25:31.076 --> 25:33.036
I'm okay, sir. Just, um...

25:35.156 --> 25:37.276
I probably need more time than I thought.

25:38.396 --> 25:40.116
I'm kind of chasing a ghost.

25:41.676 --> 25:43.916
- I beg your pardon?
- I've got to go now.

25:58.001 --> 25:59.961
Yeah, Tommy, you were right.

26:00.601 --> 26:01.881
The van blocked the window.

26:02.201 --> 26:03.961
Why is it always clowns with these guys?

26:04.121 --> 26:05.321
Because clowns are terrifying.

26:05.481 --> 26:06.761
What, you're afraid of clowns?

26:07.001 --> 26:09.801
Clowns are wankers who wear
disguises and play with children.

26:09.961 --> 26:11.841
Okay, guys, what do we
know about these clowns?

26:13.521 --> 26:16.201
The van has no plates. Looks
like the driver stayed inside.

26:17.401 --> 26:19.081
Any chance you can identify him?

26:19.321 --> 26:21.361
Let's see what the
nearby cameras picked up.

26:30.561 --> 26:31.601
Got you.

26:32.001 --> 26:33.521
Sebastian, you are remarkable.

26:34.321 --> 26:36.601
- If I wasn't German, I'd blush.
- Germans don't blush?

26:37.601 --> 26:39.201
Not at being told they're remarkable.

26:39.481 --> 26:40.841
You can get something from that?

26:41.681 --> 26:43.161
I have some enhancement programs.

26:43.841 --> 26:46.921
Would it be possible to get
run-downs on all the murdered victims?

26:47.441 --> 26:48.281
Of course.

26:48.441 --> 26:50.361
I'm specifically interested
in their cell phones.

26:50.481 --> 26:53.041
Occasionally, robberies
like this are inside jobs.

26:53.401 --> 26:55.761
So there could be some numbers
on there that may be of help.

26:57.121 --> 26:58.361
That should do it.

26:59.961 --> 27:02.361
Maurice Tasse. He's a local.

27:02.641 --> 27:05.521
2775 rue des Peupliers in Hyères.

27:51.041 --> 27:52.841
Lousy severance package, Maurice.

27:53.081 --> 27:54.641
They are killing witnesses.

27:54.961 --> 27:56.281
This is not good for the doctor.

27:56.641 --> 27:58.041
Sebastian, we're clear inside.

27:58.921 --> 28:00.201
The suspect is dead.

28:05.161 --> 28:06.321
ICC. Hickman.

28:07.721 --> 28:08.721
Who?

28:10.121 --> 28:11.521
Yeah, yeah. Bring her down.

28:12.321 --> 28:13.561
Bring her down, yeah, thanks.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.001
That's fine, thank you. I got it.

28:23.241 --> 28:24.241
Hello.

28:25.081 --> 28:26.201
Where's Tommy?

28:27.961 --> 28:29.041
Tommy's not here.

28:29.321 --> 28:31.161
Can you get a message to him?

28:32.081 --> 28:33.081
Rose, right?

28:33.561 --> 28:34.961
You're married to Tommy's brother?

28:35.601 --> 28:36.601
Colin.

28:36.641 --> 28:37.841
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:40.041 --> 28:42.361
He's beaten in prison, every day.

28:43.761 --> 28:44.841
Badly.

28:46.321 --> 28:47.761
I'm afraid they might kill him.

28:51.401 --> 28:53.841
My apologies. Please, sit.

28:55.521 --> 28:56.521
Please.

29:03.401 --> 29:05.881
I'm Carl Hickman. I work
with Tommy here at the ICC.

29:06.041 --> 29:07.201
I know who you are.

29:09.921 --> 29:10.921
Okay.

29:15.241 --> 29:16.561
Here's the thing, Rose.

29:18.441 --> 29:21.081
From what I know, and from what I've seen,

29:22.401 --> 29:25.281
Tommy gave up a whole lot to become a cop,

29:26.201 --> 29:27.321
and even more

29:29.241 --> 29:31.321
to do what he did in
London a few weeks ago.

29:31.481 --> 29:32.721
I have a brother...

29:34.321 --> 29:36.041
who was once like your husband,

29:36.401 --> 29:37.681
and I realized that

29:38.201 --> 29:40.001
in trying to help him, I...

29:41.001 --> 29:42.321
I was hurting him.

29:43.121 --> 29:44.601
Maybe that's where Tommy's at.

29:45.121 --> 29:46.801
Tommy's teaching him a lesson?

29:47.081 --> 29:49.761
No, he's letting the lesson
he's earned get taught.

29:50.881 --> 29:52.281
This is what's relevant.

29:53.001 --> 29:54.241
Tommy is my friend,

29:54.961 --> 29:56.281
he's a little like family,

29:56.521 --> 29:59.201
and I don't have a whole hell
of a lot of that in my life.

29:59.761 --> 30:00.761
So...

30:01.361 --> 30:02.601
why don't you do us a favour

30:03.241 --> 30:06.041
and go home and leave him alone, all right?

30:07.121 --> 30:08.681
Otherwise, we've got a problem,

30:09.161 --> 30:11.401
and I'm not the guy you
want to have a problem with.

30:11.921 --> 30:13.401
So I'm going to call the guard

30:13.681 --> 30:15.721
and you'll meet him at
the elevator, all right?

30:19.721 --> 30:21.841
- Tommy your family now?
- Goodbye, Rose.

30:23.881 --> 30:25.561
He ever tell you who held you hostage?

30:29.161 --> 30:30.241
Meaning?

30:30.761 --> 30:31.921
In the bank.

30:32.681 --> 30:35.281
Here in The Hague, you
were held hostage, right?

30:36.841 --> 30:38.401
Tommy ever tell you who did that?

30:39.241 --> 30:42.081
- What's your point?
- My point is the tiger.

30:44.841 --> 30:45.921
In the robbery,

30:46.881 --> 30:48.441
they were wearing animal masks, right?

30:51.601 --> 30:53.561
Well, the tiger was Colin, Tommy's brother.

30:58.401 --> 31:00.521
Oh, Tommy knew.

31:01.761 --> 31:02.801
Sure.

31:03.521 --> 31:06.121
He knew that day. He let him go.

31:07.441 --> 31:09.081
Spoke to him about it more than once.

31:10.761 --> 31:13.081
Oh, you didn't know.

31:15.401 --> 31:17.281
Well, I guess that's what family is, right?

31:18.121 --> 31:19.601
Always letting you down.

31:25.081 --> 31:26.401
I'm not afraid of you.

31:27.321 --> 31:28.441
Neither's Colin.

31:29.641 --> 31:30.961
We're Travellers.

31:31.561 --> 31:33.801
The whole world is our problem.

31:35.321 --> 31:36.521
Get in line.

31:44.881 --> 31:46.121
This was on the bed.

31:48.321 --> 31:50.881
We'll match it with what's
missing from the jewelry store.

31:52.521 --> 31:54.801
I'm no expert, but it
all looks pretty cheap.

31:54.961 --> 31:56.681
Explains why they left
it after the killing.

31:57.201 --> 31:58.961
Not why they stole it in the first place.

31:59.761 --> 32:00.801
Detective Seeger?

32:01.081 --> 32:03.401
Inspector Fabre said you wanted
cell phones of the victims?

32:03.481 --> 32:04.881
Their call histories, yes.

32:05.081 --> 32:06.441
I'm afraid we have bad news.

32:06.841 --> 32:09.041
None of them had a phone when
they went to the hospital.

32:09.481 --> 32:11.881
And we've searched the store
again. No phones anywhere.

32:12.521 --> 32:13.761
None of them had cell phones?

32:13.961 --> 32:15.281
Or they were taken.

32:15.441 --> 32:17.017
Do you reckon the bad guys still have them?

32:17.041 --> 32:18.321
All I need are the numbers.

32:26.681 --> 32:28.201
Looks like the cells are all together.

32:34.161 --> 32:35.841
About 50 kilometers away.

32:38.561 --> 32:40.201
You wanted to see me, Hickman?

32:40.441 --> 32:42.361
Do you remember the bank
robbery in The Hague?

32:43.001 --> 32:45.721
- I was taken hostage?
- I most certainly do.

32:47.961 --> 32:49.721
Did you prosecute the men who were caught?

32:49.961 --> 32:53.121
No, I did not personally, but
I monitored the prosecution.

32:54.121 --> 32:55.601
They were each convicted and

32:55.801 --> 32:58.361
sentenced to incarceration
for a very long time.

32:59.801 --> 33:00.801
Why?

33:03.321 --> 33:05.601
Did anyone identify the last robber,

33:06.361 --> 33:07.561
the one who got away?

33:08.401 --> 33:09.481
The tiger?

33:10.481 --> 33:12.121
What has happened, Carl?

33:13.801 --> 33:16.201
Do you, or anyone here,

33:18.121 --> 33:19.641
know who the tiger was?

33:20.001 --> 33:21.001
No.

33:21.401 --> 33:24.001
His identity was never revealed to the ICC.

33:25.001 --> 33:27.041
No one I know knows who he is.

33:33.441 --> 33:35.401
I've got to get back to Marseille.

33:37.321 --> 33:38.521
All right.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.041
It's almost time.

33:43.881 --> 33:44.881
What is that?

33:45.881 --> 33:46.881
New toy.

33:48.041 --> 33:49.281
What does it do?

34:03.321 --> 34:04.561
Major damage.

34:05.681 --> 34:06.761
Gentlemen...

34:08.201 --> 34:09.801
- I think we're ready.
- For what?

34:11.681 --> 34:13.161
For whatever comes our way.

34:19.402 --> 34:21.562
No tenant is currently
listed at that address.

34:21.722 --> 34:25.121
Looks like the entire building
has been vacant since 2007.

34:25.762 --> 34:27.002
Keep your eyes open.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.722
We are hunting very desperate men.

35:30.162 --> 35:33.162
Major, third floor, all the way to the end.

35:33.642 --> 35:34.682
We found something.

35:39.602 --> 35:41.642
Hi, it's Amanda. Leave me a message.

35:42.002 --> 35:43.002
Hey.

35:43.482 --> 35:44.482
Hey, it's me.

35:46.362 --> 35:48.202
I know you're not gonna
get this until morning,

35:48.642 --> 35:50.362
and I was thinking...

35:54.202 --> 35:56.122
I don't need any more
time to figure this out.

35:59.242 --> 36:00.882
When this job is over, I'm...

36:01.762 --> 36:02.762
I'm ready.

36:03.162 --> 36:04.162
I'm home.

36:05.322 --> 36:06.922
I'll call you in a day or two, okay?

36:07.882 --> 36:09.322
All right, goodbye.

36:11.362 --> 36:12.442
Oh, uh...

36:13.762 --> 36:14.802
Amanda?

36:17.082 --> 36:18.282
I love you, baby.

36:24.482 --> 36:27.162
They left the phones, they left the jewels.

36:27.962 --> 36:29.242
- Why?
- Why?

36:29.922 --> 36:31.842
Maybe someone tipped them we were coming.

36:33.002 --> 36:34.202
The French police?

36:34.642 --> 36:36.002
It was not one of us.

36:39.242 --> 36:40.282
Did you hear that?

36:42.442 --> 36:44.162
Check it out, but be careful.

36:47.282 --> 36:49.002
I'll get the ScanGen from the car.

36:49.562 --> 36:52.082
They left in a hurry. They might
have left some actual evidence.

36:52.482 --> 36:53.482
Good.

37:02.442 --> 37:03.722
Help me!

37:09.322 --> 37:10.762
Somebody, please!

37:20.042 --> 37:21.042
Hello?

37:22.922 --> 37:24.082
We're the police.

37:24.602 --> 37:25.602
- Hello?
- Hello?

37:27.562 --> 37:29.282
- Doctor Clarke?
- Yes.

37:29.922 --> 37:30.922
We're the police.

37:33.122 --> 37:35.162
Are you okay? I'm taking this off.

37:35.362 --> 37:36.362
Okay.

37:37.362 --> 37:38.362
Are you okay?

37:53.482 --> 37:54.482
Come on!

37:57.162 --> 37:59.202
Go! Go! Get in!

39:27.762 --> 39:29.002
Get out! Get out!

39:54.402 --> 39:55.442
Thank you.

40:07.642 --> 40:08.482
Hey.

40:08.642 --> 40:09.802
Thanks, that's great.

40:10.122 --> 40:12.682
- Any trouble finding it all?
- No, no, the rest is in the squad.

40:13.962 --> 40:15.362
So how did you find this place?

40:15.562 --> 40:17.562
Cell phones from the jewelry store robbery.

40:18.562 --> 40:19.682
They kept them?

40:20.402 --> 40:23.242
Well, not as smart as we thought obviously.

40:25.162 --> 40:27.202
- Where's Tommy?
- He's not here.

40:28.202 --> 40:30.562
There was another robbery.
They killed two police officers.

40:31.802 --> 40:33.042
Yeah, I heard.

40:33.602 --> 40:35.682
I sent Tommy and Arabela
to check the scene.

40:36.362 --> 40:37.362
How is she?

40:37.442 --> 40:38.442
She's fine...

40:39.322 --> 40:40.522
physically anyway.

40:41.122 --> 40:42.842
She doesn't want to go to the hospital.

40:43.842 --> 40:44.842
Okay.

40:50.842 --> 40:52.402
Doctor Clarke? Hi.

40:53.042 --> 40:54.642
I'm Carl Hickman from the ICC.

40:55.282 --> 40:56.402
You're an American.

40:57.282 --> 40:58.282
I am.

40:59.602 --> 41:02.082
The Major says that you do
not want to go to the hospital?

41:02.602 --> 41:05.402
No, I have access to a
villa just outside of Lyon.

41:05.762 --> 41:07.122
I stay there sometimes.

41:07.602 --> 41:09.402
I'd just like to be in
familiar surroundings.

41:09.602 --> 41:12.162
I feel like that's the best way
to begin healing from the trauma.

41:12.802 --> 41:13.962
Self-diagnosis?

41:14.842 --> 41:17.362
It's hard to forgo a philosophy
that I've been advocating

41:17.522 --> 41:18.682
most of my life.

41:19.802 --> 41:21.042
Well, you wrote a book on it.

41:21.642 --> 41:22.722
You know my book?

41:24.962 --> 41:26.402
Only that it exists.

41:27.282 --> 41:29.522
Google makes us seem smarter these days.

41:30.722 --> 41:32.442
Isn't there a saying about a...

41:33.042 --> 41:35.482
doctor treating himself
having a fool for a patient?

41:36.202 --> 41:37.362
Or herself.

41:44.202 --> 41:46.482
Hola, Senora. ¿Conoce a este hombre?

41:47.802 --> 41:48.802
No?

42:15.082 --> 42:16.642
Looks like 9mm automatic.

42:16.802 --> 42:18.338
You can tell just by looking at the holes?

42:18.362 --> 42:19.402
It's just a guess.

42:19.522 --> 42:22.642
Detectives, we just got off the phone
with the store's owner, Fredrick.

42:23.042 --> 42:24.042
He's in Cannes.

42:24.122 --> 42:25.682
He says nothing was taken from the safe

42:25.722 --> 42:28.002
and he doesn't think anything
was taken from the floor.

42:28.202 --> 42:29.522
Can he get us an inventory?

42:29.722 --> 42:31.218
He's not worried about the floor items.

42:31.242 --> 42:32.778
That makes him the first
store owner in history

42:32.802 --> 42:34.578
not to care about tens
of thousands in inventory.

42:34.602 --> 42:36.082
Because nothing on the floor is real.

42:36.202 --> 42:38.842
The jewels kept out there are only display.

42:39.122 --> 42:40.122
Replicas.

42:40.922 --> 42:42.498
Why would these guys break out of prison

42:42.522 --> 42:44.938
to steal a handful of cheap
jewelry and replicas in Marseille?

42:44.962 --> 42:47.242
And murder six people
including two police officers.

42:47.362 --> 42:48.442
There's something strange.

42:49.802 --> 42:51.602
Hold on, I have to take this. Eva?

42:51.762 --> 42:53.722
Tommy, I need you to come here.

42:54.282 --> 42:55.682
What's wrong? Where are you, Spain?

42:55.842 --> 42:58.122
Yeah. Someone sent me a note.

42:58.442 --> 43:01.642
He wants to meet me today,
but he told me to be alone.

43:01.762 --> 43:02.762
I need someone here.

43:02.842 --> 43:04.922
What are you talking about?
Who? Who sent you a note?

43:05.042 --> 43:07.762
Eva, I'm at a crime scene. There
were two cops shot in Marseille.

43:08.362 --> 43:09.762
Right. Sorry to bother you.

43:09.922 --> 43:11.242
No, look, that's not what I mean.

43:11.282 --> 43:12.962
Listen, I can handle this alone, okay?

43:13.282 --> 43:14.362
I'll find a way to come.

43:14.562 --> 43:16.882
I've got to go now.
It's almost time. Thanks.

43:20.642 --> 43:21.962
Listen, before you leave,

43:22.762 --> 43:25.402
it would be really important
if I asked a few more questions.

43:26.202 --> 43:27.842
It's helpful for the investigation.

43:29.402 --> 43:31.682
Um, tell me again about

43:32.562 --> 43:34.562
what you remember of
how they transported you.

43:36.202 --> 43:37.602
Okay, so, like I said,

43:38.162 --> 43:41.402
Lucien put me in a van,
someone blindfolded me,

43:41.562 --> 43:44.402
and then we drove for hours
in almost complete silence.

43:44.762 --> 43:46.202
"Almost complete silence?"

43:47.762 --> 43:49.042
What did you hear?

43:52.042 --> 43:54.122
I'm sorry, my brain's a complete fog.

43:54.242 --> 43:57.282
It's okay. That's all
right. Trauma can do that.

43:57.482 --> 43:59.162
- I know. I've studied it.
- Yeah.

44:01.362 --> 44:02.402
Can I go now?

44:04.282 --> 44:05.722
Look, just for a few hours.

44:06.322 --> 44:07.482
I'll go back to the villa,

44:08.042 --> 44:10.602
