-Yeah.
-So nice to meet you.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.105
Wow, she's gorgeous.

You can see her in

14:50.628 --> 14:53.370
-Totally.
-I feel really weird now.

No, no, no, no, no. No, I--
look, I totally get it.

14:55.546 --> 14:58.506
Seriously, you're being
really smart about this.

14:58.549 --> 14:59.899
Thank you.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.988
Why don't you
guys come inside?

15:02.031 --> 15:03.250
After you.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.818
So, how long have
you been modeling?

15:06.862 --> 15:09.038
Oh, I'm not, I--
I teach Pilates.

15:09.082 --> 15:10.997
Oh, do you have
your own studio, or?

15:11.040 --> 15:12.650
No, I wish.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.043
Someday, hopefully.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.698
You never know, this
might open up opportunities.

15:16.741 --> 15:17.264
Oh.

15:18.395 --> 15:20.267
So, um, we have
water, we have fruit,

Um, anything you need,
I'm your man, okay?

15:35.804 --> 15:36.979
You know, do you
have a bathroom?

15:37.023 --> 15:38.415
I just need a bathroom.

15:38.459 --> 15:41.027
Yeah, we have a bathroom,
it's just through there.

Okay.

Um, okay, why don't you
come and stand on the X here

I will let you know

really nice to meet you both.

Now, what do you think?

19:02.793 --> 19:07.058
I think that all you
need is a halo.

Come on.

He was, he was
actually really cool.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.283
-Yeah?
-He was, yeah,

19:14.327 --> 19:15.502
very professional,
there was an assistant,

19:15.545 --> 19:18.200
and she was very very
nice and helpful,

19:18.244 --> 19:21.290
and yeah, it was kinda fun.

19:21.334 --> 19:23.466
And did you see any
of the pictures he took?

19:23.510 --> 19:27.166
Yeah, I saw them, and I was
surprised, they were good.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.603
I mean, I had no idea
what I was doing.

19:29.646 --> 19:32.040
Babe, sometimes you
just gotta go for it.

Oh, I don't know,
I don't know if,

19:33.781 --> 19:35.348
I mean, I have no
idea what I'm doing.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.611
And I'll have to rearrange
the whole studio tomorrow,

19:37.654 --> 19:39.961

take care of Olivia all day,

19:40.004 --> 19:41.528
I just don't know.

Well, she's a 60-year-old
divorced woman with a blind dog,

19:46.097 --> 19:48.099
what else is she gonna do, huh?

19:49.231 --> 19:50.101

I gotta be thin tomorrow.

You have to count to 10.

We don't have time
to count to one.

20:45.940 --> 20:49.160
Okay, I guess I'll just have
to sell these wings on eBay.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.729
No!

20:56.298 --> 20:57.560
Do you like 'em?

20:58.300 --> 21:00.128
Why do angels need glitter?

21:01.347 --> 21:07.004
Well, I guess they
need it to light our way,

21:07.048 --> 21:10.225
'cause when they walk around,
the glitter falls off,

21:10.269 --> 21:12.923

where they went.

It's like fairy dust.

Ouch.

He is kinda old.

21:22.106 --> 21:23.325
Should we get a new one?

21:23.369 --> 21:27.329
No, I'm saving him for Lisa.

21:27.373 --> 21:28.809
Who's Lisa?

21:28.852 --> 21:32.682
Mark said he was gonna
get me a sister called Lisa.

21:34.205 --> 21:35.555
Did he now?

28:32.754 --> 28:33.581
Go ahead.

28:36.584 --> 28:41.067
[stammering]
I can't do that.

28:41.110 --> 28:44.374
You can, and you will.

There you go.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.301
Okay, let's see.

28:58.345 --> 29:00.521
[stammering]
Please don't make me do this.

29:00.564 --> 29:01.914
You don't have a choice.

29:03.437 --> 29:04.351
The blue ones.

29:05.091 --> 29:06.570
-I can't.
-Let's see it.

29:06.614 --> 29:08.529
I can't do it, please.

[punch thuds]

[coughing and gasping]

29:20.497 --> 29:21.716
Come on, come on.

29:23.718 --> 29:24.588
Come on.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.287
-Now, look.
-[gasping]

29:28.679 --> 29:31.378
That's gonna swell, so...

29:32.596 --> 29:34.294
Better get you some ibuprofen.

29:36.513 --> 29:38.211
Maybe a little makeup.

29:38.254 --> 29:40.648
Come on, breathe, breathe.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, breathe.

You're all right.

[gasping]

29:48.961 --> 29:50.789
I know.

Now, are we clear?

[whimpering]

29:59.667 --> 30:00.973
You gotta nod.

Pl--
please don't make me do this.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.093
I'm just gonna
take a few photos.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.443
Just like yesterday.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.707
You didn't seem so shy then.

31:26.754 --> 31:27.668
The robe.

31:29.496 --> 31:33.804
The quicker we start, the
quicker it'll be over.

31:37.504 --> 31:38.287
I'll do it.

31:39.071 --> 31:40.246
It's okay.

31:41.682 --> 31:42.770
Mm.

Hm.

32:17.979 --> 32:19.938
C-scar, hm?

32:19.981 --> 32:22.853
So, this one's yours?

32:23.942 --> 32:26.640
[stammering]
That's my little girl.

32:26.683 --> 32:28.163
Yeah, she's beautiful.

32:29.512 --> 32:34.213

[whimpering]

I'm just a mom.

32:48.140 --> 32:50.098
I don't do this kind of thing.

32:50.142 --> 32:53.362
I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

called a betta fish.

32:57.801 --> 33:00.369
He's happy on his own.

33:00.413 --> 33:03.372
In fact, you try
and add someone,

33:04.808 --> 33:07.724
turns him into a fighter,
maybe even a killer.

33:09.509 --> 33:13.295
Now, they've been known
to tolerate tank mates,

33:13.339 --> 33:15.384
but if they can't be friends,

33:16.211 --> 33:22.000
the situation turns nasty fast.

33:22.043 --> 33:25.177
And without any plants or rocks,

33:26.091 --> 33:27.701
that means there's
nowhere to hide.

33:28.745 --> 33:33.446
The only hope for survival
for any new addition

33:33.489 --> 33:38.233
is to keep its head down
and do whatever it can

33:38.277 --> 33:44.370
to make sure that the
betta remains content.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.068

Are you gonna kill me?

34:00.125 --> 34:01.691
Are you gonna kill me?

34:02.910 --> 34:04.999
No, I would never kill you.

34:05.913 --> 34:07.306
You're far too beautiful.

34:08.568 --> 34:11.049
We're just gonna
take some pictures.

34:11.092 --> 34:13.964
That's it, just like before.

34:15.792 --> 34:19.927
Then what, you
gonna let me go home?

34:19.969 --> 34:21.188
'Cause I have a little daughter.

I'll make you agree,

48:49.622 --> 48:52.494
you can't, you can't
treat me like this.

48:58.457 --> 48:59.284
Okay.

49:00.633 --> 49:03.853
It seems someone is ready
for some more milk.

Isobel, come here.

50:00.780 --> 50:01.520
Get that.

50:02.651 --> 50:06.351
Yeah, good, there
you go, good girl.

50:08.483 --> 50:09.441
So...

50:10.920 --> 50:12.139
I've changed it this time,

50:12.183 --> 50:15.229
but I'd like you to
get used to changing it

50:15.273 --> 50:18.406
every three or four clients.

50:18.450 --> 50:22.323
People come here to
be safe and clean.

50:23.672 --> 50:24.760
I'm pregnant.

50:28.460 --> 50:31.680
Of course you are.
[chuckles]

50:32.899 --> 50:34.161
They always say this.

50:34.205 --> 50:36.903
No, I really am pregnant.

50:36.946 --> 50:37.730
Really?

50:38.818 --> 50:41.647
If it's about the milk,
take these.

50:42.996 --> 50:44.389
Those'll help relax you.

50:47.609 --> 50:49.524
My boyfriend dropped
me off yesterday,

50:49.568 --> 50:51.831
so he knows where the studio is.

50:55.400 --> 50:58.707
It's a good thing you
didn't bring him in.

51:00.361 --> 51:02.276
What would you've
done if I did?

51:03.408 --> 51:05.540
Taken a few shots and then...

51:07.281 --> 51:09.370
let you go on your way.

You can't just keep me here.

-Why?

52:27.709 --> 52:28.754
Why do you care?

52:31.322 --> 52:33.585
Why would you
mistake me for caring?

52:35.108 --> 52:36.414
You're nothing special.

52:37.328 --> 52:42.507
I just want to
prove that you lied.

52:42.550 --> 52:43.943
Just like the others.

You know, they're
not always accurate.

Sometimes, sometimes you
have to have a blood test

to show the real results.

53:46.745 --> 53:47.920

this one's accurate.

53:53.230 --> 53:58.104
I, I apologize, it's just...

they usually lie.

No.

Um, about three weeks.

This is the most
important period.

Have you been taking vitamins?

54:24.130 --> 54:26.175
Can I get you a, a sandwich?

this is the place.

something upstairs.

no one ever got out before.

01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:13.915
You're smart.

01:08:16.221 --> 01:08:17.310
I like you.

01:08:19.051 --> 01:08:20.966

I know where you
went to high school,

01:08:34.545 --> 01:08:36.286
when you had your last vacation,

01:08:37.156 --> 01:08:38.939
I have your Pilates schedule.

01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:43.466
Everything in your phone
is in my computer, so...

01:08:44.642 --> 01:08:49.037
it really does not matter
that you know where I live

or that my real name's Patrick.

01:08:56.567 --> 01:08:58.308
Because the people I work with,

01:08:59.613 --> 01:09:04.009
they also have your
information, you understand?

01:09:04.051 --> 01:09:09.928
It's what we call insurance,

You don't want her next play

Can I trust you, Isobel?

01:09:37.782 --> 01:09:40.350
You stay away
from my daughter.

You have other people
to think about.

can be with your family.

Why should I believe you?

01:18:50.377 --> 01:18:53.511
