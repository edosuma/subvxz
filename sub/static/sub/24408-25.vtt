that's where I found Big Pinchy for the first time!

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
I have no way of knowing if Big Pinchy still lives here.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
Maybe he married, had kids, and moved to an apartment.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
But if he's anywhere, he's under this rock.

-Holy moly! -He's huge!

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Well, well, there.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Do you remember me?

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
When I saw you in between those rocks all those years ago,

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
I thought you were trapped and needed help.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
But I guess I was a fool, as green as pea soup.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
That was your home, but that made me think,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
and that thought never left me.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
How can he live in that small pool?

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
What would he eat?

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
I must find him again with my lifetime companions.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I'm glad to see you're all right, old man.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
I brought you booty from overseas.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
And, hey, I'll be back to check on you again,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000

Nah, man.
