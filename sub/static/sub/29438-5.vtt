WEBVTT

00:01.412 --> 00:03.360
Lamar is his biological father.

00:03.362 --> 00:06.273
Your mother is better
than me in every way.

00:06.274 --> 00:08.607
My hope is that you'll reach out to her.

00:08.608 --> 00:10.276
You crossed lines that
I would never cross.

00:10.277 --> 00:11.511
Talking about the hostage?

00:11.512 --> 00:13.580
I'm talking about the
patient that you tortured

00:13.581 --> 00:15.215
to get the information that you needed.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.417
- I'm pregnant.
- But Adaku's getting great care

00:17.418 --> 00:18.785
and she's done everything right.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.853
Pregnancy hormones might
bring her cancer back.

00:20.854 --> 00:24.758
Jessie died of a pulmonary
embolism. Five other

00:24.759 --> 00:27.026
dialysis patients died at Chastain.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.862
I think whatever killed your sister...

00:28.863 --> 00:30.031
it killed them, too.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.938
If you want to make a call,

00:37.939 --> 00:40.539
you got to pick up the
phone and hit the buttons.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.041
I don't know if I should call.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.743
Head injury in one is a pilot.
Just flew in from New York.

00:44.744 --> 00:47.947
Took a tumble down the escalator,
so they brought him right in.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.950
His blood alcohol was .06.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.720
Which means he was drunk
while flying the plane.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.864
And according to his liver enzymes,

00:56.865 --> 00:58.291
this is not his first time.

00:58.292 --> 00:59.592
He's a chronic drinker.

00:59.593 --> 01:00.794
- No question.
- So you're thinking

01:00.795 --> 01:02.996
about whether you should
report him to the FAA.

01:02.997 --> 01:05.098
But in order to make that call,

01:05.099 --> 01:07.099
have to reveal his medical information,

01:07.100 --> 01:08.801
- which violates HIPAA.
- Exactly.

01:08.802 --> 01:11.238
Patients need to know that
they can come to us for help

01:11.239 --> 01:14.673
- without getting in trouble.
- This guy is a safety risk to others.

01:14.674 --> 01:16.539
HIPAA rules won't matter
to the people he kills

01:16.540 --> 01:18.979
if he's in the cockpit.

01:18.980 --> 01:21.082
Make the call.

01:28.382 --> 01:30.742
Bandage can come off tomorrow.

01:30.743 --> 01:33.413
Okay. So, uh, am I
good to get out of here?

01:37.998 --> 01:40.501
Tell me, how often do you fly drunk?

01:44.971 --> 01:47.441
So, what... you gonna report me?

01:48.475 --> 01:50.709
I thought about it.

01:50.710 --> 01:52.680
But no.

01:56.657 --> 01:58.552
There's an AA meeting around the corner.

01:58.553 --> 02:01.387
I'm-I'm not a drunk.

02:01.388 --> 02:02.557
Take it.

02:05.358 --> 02:06.625
Yeah, I-I...

02:06.626 --> 02:08.463
I don't think I have a problem.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.798
I promise. Okay?

02:12.799 --> 02:15.035
I'll-I'll read through it.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.141
And I'll give it some... real thought.

02:22.843 --> 02:26.345
Radiology transport needed in the ER.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.714
Radiology transport needed in the ER.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.161
Conrad, what's going on?

02:42.162 --> 02:45.165
I couldn't sleep. I can't
stop thinking about Jessie.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.367
And all the dialysis patients that died

02:47.368 --> 02:49.201
because of these blood clots.

02:49.202 --> 02:51.206
Well, have you found anything?

02:53.607 --> 02:55.209
Oh, my God. You did.

02:56.243 --> 02:58.778
I went over all the information we have,

02:58.779 --> 03:01.213
and there is a long...

03:01.214 --> 03:03.415
safety record

03:03.416 --> 03:05.420
for every medication they were on.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.888
Except for one.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.856
Hemopleatin.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.694
These types of drugs can
increase the risk of clots.

03:15.095 --> 03:17.529
Does hemopleatin increase
that risk more than others?

03:17.530 --> 03:19.298
I don't know.

03:19.299 --> 03:22.303
Conrad, could this have caused
the P.E. that killed Jessie?

03:24.304 --> 03:25.939
I don't know enough yet,

03:25.940 --> 03:27.742
but we need to talk to people who might.

03:31.978 --> 03:34.616
I can't believe this
all started with my dad.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.885
He really believed there
was more to Jessie's death.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.888
I think he could've been right.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.926
I already confirmed
your afternoon pitches

03:46.927 --> 03:48.160
for the health supplement.

03:48.161 --> 03:50.262
Then roll dat ass to Midtown,

03:50.263 --> 03:52.131
'cause I just scored you

03:52.132 --> 03:54.401
the Rain Man suite at el Cuatro Seasons.

03:54.402 --> 03:57.403
I'm talking upgrades on upgrades, baby.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.804
The views are gonna be pano-ram.

03:58.805 --> 04:00.839
- Good.
- I got you.

04:00.840 --> 04:04.311
Question is, do you got a lady
in the Big A or what?

04:05.747 --> 04:07.749
Get out of my chair.

04:10.317 --> 04:12.618
Thanks for your patience.
We'll now begin boarding

04:12.619 --> 04:15.322
our first-class passengers
for New York City.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.931
Hi. How you doing?

04:24.932 --> 04:27.032
Good, thank you.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.635
I'm sorry, sir.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.337
We're not boarding your zone yet.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.171
You just called first class.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.341
Yes, and you are in coach.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.609
I don't fly coach. Just scan it again.

04:38.345 --> 04:41.214
Yeah, no, see? Right
here, it says "Zone 5".

04:41.215 --> 04:43.849
Uh, you know, um... my
assistant probably...

04:43.850 --> 04:45.952
Sir, we have a full flight today.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.186
If you could just step to the side

04:47.187 --> 04:48.455
so that our first-class passengers

04:48.456 --> 04:51.043
can continue boarding.

04:51.044 --> 04:53.025
Thanks. We'll be with you in a second.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.193
Hi, sir.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.563
Here you go. Enjoy your flight.
You're welcome.

04:57.564 --> 04:59.464
Ladies and gentlemen,

04:59.465 --> 05:01.234
welcome aboard Flight 1980,

05:01.235 --> 05:03.068
with service from Atlanta to New York.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.171
We are currently third
in line for takeoff

05:05.172 --> 05:07.907
and are expected to be in
the air in approximately

05:07.908 --> 05:09.174
seven minutes' time.

05:18.184 --> 05:20.553
Flying solo?

05:20.554 --> 05:21.721
- Mm.
- Me, too.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.722
Ellen went up yesterday.

05:23.723 --> 05:25.157
Her brother's got a cabin upstate.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.260
It's a five-hour drive,
but cheaper than a hotel.

05:27.261 --> 05:29.195
Ellen's my wife.

05:29.196 --> 05:32.031
- 42 years.
- Flight attendants, prepare for takeoff.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.435
You married?

05:34.735 --> 05:36.335
No ring. Whoa.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.238
Handsome guy like you
must have some fun.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.573
I know I'm not a lot
to look at right now,

05:41.574 --> 05:43.342
but, let me tell you, when I was young,

05:43.343 --> 05:44.577
oh...

05:44.578 --> 05:46.178
... there were ladies.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.914
Oh, yeah.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.248
Then I met Ellen.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.217
Blind date.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.952
Can you believe it? Yeah,
mini golf. True story.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.192
Our second date was Argentinian food.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.626
Oh, boy.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.710
Let me tell you, that
did a number on my wallet

06:02.711 --> 06:03.762
and stomach.

06:03.763 --> 06:06.065
Oh, boy, let me tell you...

06:19.780 --> 06:21.947
Somebody help me!

06:21.948 --> 06:23.216
Let me help!

We have to get out.

07:08.162 --> 07:09.297
Come on.

07:34.649 --> 07:36.674
Yeah, I heard on the radio.

07:36.675 --> 07:38.190
They say most passengers are okay,

07:38.191 --> 07:39.224
but the seriously injured

07:39.225 --> 07:41.226
are headed here, Atlanta
General and Emory.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.863
- All right, I'll turn around.
- No, you will not.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.532
We have plenty of trauma surgeons here.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.734
And we both know you
have other plans today.

07:47.735 --> 07:49.835
Look, I know you're nervous, but

07:49.836 --> 07:51.738
you have to do this.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.238
You decided. You're going.

07:53.239 --> 07:55.508
I just have this feeling
in the pit of my stomach

07:55.509 --> 07:57.577
that I'm about to do harm.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.178
And I do not like to do harm.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.046
Chastain will page you if they need you.

08:01.047 --> 08:02.882
Go.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.073
Oh, my God!

08:11.074 --> 08:13.560
- Oh, my God!
- 34-year-old female

08:13.561 --> 08:15.292
with blunt head trauma
and a large scalp lac.

08:15.293 --> 08:17.095
- GCS and vitals?
- GCS, 14.

08:17.096 --> 08:19.198
BP, 108/60. Pulse, 92.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.867
Okay, let's get her to CT.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.267
Let's hear it!

08:22.268 --> 08:25.095
76-year-old male with complaints
of diffuse abdominal pain.

08:25.096 --> 08:26.605
Still hypotensive after
two liters normal saline.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.107
Tell me exactly where it hurts.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.078
All right, let's get him to 11, please.

08:32.546 --> 08:35.547
60-year-old male with
significant trauma...

08:35.548 --> 08:38.684
an unstable pelvis,
open radial fracture.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.097
Randolph, you were on the plane?

08:40.097 --> 08:41.421
Yeah. I'm fine.

08:41.422 --> 08:43.258
Him, not so much.

08:56.803 --> 08:59.872
He's had 12 milligrams
of morphine so far.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.206
Let's hang two grams cephalexin.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.541
Mild diffuse tenderness.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.109
Postponed all my elective surgeries.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.878
- What do we have here?
- Well, he wasn't wearing

09:05.879 --> 09:07.647
his seat belt when the plane dropped.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.983
He hit the ceiling hard
and then fell to the floor.

09:09.984 --> 09:12.151
How you doing? I'm Dr. Cain.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.321
Can you wiggle your fingers
and give me the okay sign?

09:15.755 --> 09:17.757
- Perfect.
- I can't feel

09:17.758 --> 09:19.813
- distal pulses. I need the Doppler.
- How about thumbs-up...

09:19.814 --> 09:20.949
can you do that?

09:22.930 --> 09:24.330
Radial nerve injury.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.565
- I need to get him to the OR.
- He needs

09:25.566 --> 09:27.666
a pan-scan and angios of his extremities

09:27.667 --> 09:28.767
before he goes to the OR.

09:28.768 --> 09:30.302
Ellen.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.970
That's his wife.

09:31.971 --> 09:33.439
Don't worry.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.840
- We'll get her here.
- Dr. B.

09:34.841 --> 09:37.310
Dr. B, you're alive. I never pray,

09:37.311 --> 09:39.505
but when I saw the crash on the
news, I prayed hard.

09:39.506 --> 09:43.115
- Okay. Thank you, Grayson.
- Are you all right?

09:43.116 --> 09:45.777
- Yeah. I'm just a little stiff.
- We should get you checked out.

09:45.778 --> 09:48.393
Or we can focus on the people
here who are actually hurt.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.536
Ms. Mitchka.

10:03.537 --> 10:04.872
Dr. Hawkins.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.273
Where's my phone?

10:08.274 --> 10:10.609
Oh, sorry. I know-I know you
don't allow these in here.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.878
I saw the signs. I-I just...

10:11.879 --> 10:13.879
I have to try to reschedule a meeting

10:13.880 --> 10:16.315
- in New York and get there ASAP.
- You've had a pretty rough day.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.216
- I'll make an exception.
- Thanks.

10:18.217 --> 10:19.652
Any past medical problems?

10:19.653 --> 10:23.056
Oh, just strangers waking
me up in weird places,

10:23.057 --> 10:25.724
like car washes, drive-throughs.

10:25.725 --> 10:27.727
But a hospital's a new one.

10:27.728 --> 10:30.062
I can fall asleep anywhere,
whether I want to or not.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.464
Narcolepsy?

10:31.465 --> 10:33.498
Since I was nine.

10:33.499 --> 10:34.666
Sorry.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.502
Sorry, I... This is so rude, I know.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.403
I just... I have to e-mail my boss.

10:38.404 --> 10:41.068
They don't give you the day off
after being in a plane crash?

10:41.069 --> 10:43.242
I just... I can't risk losing this job.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.267
Most employers aren't so patient

10:45.268 --> 10:46.624
about the whole falling asleep thing.

10:46.625 --> 10:47.714
What do you do?

10:47.715 --> 10:49.716
I sell accounting software.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.518
Yeah.

10:53.519 --> 10:55.655
I don't love it, but I get to travel.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.657
And on, uh... on planes,

10:57.658 --> 11:00.204
no one judges you for falling asleep,

11:00.205 --> 11:02.561
so... oh... that... so that's a perk.

11:02.562 --> 11:03.896
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.230
Oh.

11:05.231 --> 11:08.068
Your blood pressure's high.

11:11.584 --> 11:14.440
Says here you're on
three medications for it.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.942
Sometimes I forget.

11:16.943 --> 11:20.713
Honestly, it never seems to help anyway.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.014
- Are we done?
- High BP is a tricky one.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.084
It's called the silent
killer for a reason.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.753
You don't feel the damage
it's doing on a daily basis.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.222
Okay.

11:29.223 --> 11:31.724
So, before you go back to work,

11:31.725 --> 11:34.060
I'd like to keep you
here, run some tests,

11:34.061 --> 11:35.762
get your BP under control.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.463
I'll have someone come
back and suture that up.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.897
And I'll write your boss

11:38.898 --> 11:40.902
the best doctor's note you've ever seen.

11:44.605 --> 11:46.071
How's the eye?

11:46.072 --> 11:47.406
She'll be fine.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.275
No foreign bodies.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.243
Just a pterygium.

11:51.244 --> 11:54.968
Pterygium. P-T-E-R-Y-G-I-U-M.

11:54.969 --> 11:57.550
- Nice.
- Oh, come on. That was too easy.

11:57.551 --> 11:58.977
They were headed to a spelling bee.

11:58.978 --> 12:01.420
- Ah.
- And Rufus here

12:01.421 --> 12:05.258
suffered quite the
scare, but his tachycardia

12:05.259 --> 12:07.225
was resolved with a bit of juice.

12:07.226 --> 12:10.013
Tachycardia. T-A-K...

12:11.063 --> 12:13.412
C-H, not K.

12:13.413 --> 12:16.935
Tachys from the Greek "tachys",
meaning "quick, rapid".

12:16.936 --> 12:18.671
Cardia from the Latinized "kardia"

12:18.672 --> 12:21.674
- meaning... "heart".
- Mm.

12:21.675 --> 12:25.411
Dr. Hawkins won the
Chatham County Spelling Bee

12:25.412 --> 12:27.512
when he was your age.
Loves to bring it up.

12:27.513 --> 12:29.782
Ah, it's the biggest
bee in the Southeast.

12:29.783 --> 12:32.153
I've never heard of it.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.536
You're early.

12:49.836 --> 12:52.003
I saw the news.

12:52.004 --> 12:54.509
Time of death, 10:13.

12:55.509 --> 12:57.109
You all right?

12:57.110 --> 12:58.945
That pilot I treated last night...

12:58.946 --> 13:01.382
he'd fly between New York and
Atlanta for the same airline.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.552
I thought I'd convinced him to get help.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.023
You didn't report him?

13:12.893 --> 13:14.896
You think he was flying this plane?

13:17.063 --> 13:19.166
I could've stopped him.

13:20.362 --> 13:22.797
It's a great drug.

13:22.798 --> 13:24.700
So much so, we made hemopleatin

13:24.701 --> 13:25.834
the standard of care

13:25.835 --> 13:27.879
for anemic patients six months ago.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.939
- Any adverse side effects?
- None.

13:29.940 --> 13:32.024
- In fact, quite the opposite.
- Uh, six patients

13:32.025 --> 13:33.319
recently died of a P.E.

13:33.320 --> 13:34.854
Would you say that hemopleatin patients

13:34.855 --> 13:36.502
are more likely to get blood clots?

13:36.503 --> 13:39.124
My colleagues and I do
weekly case conferences.

13:39.125 --> 13:40.625
If a drug were killing our patients,

13:40.626 --> 13:42.228
- we'd notice.
- How many patients

13:42.229 --> 13:43.830
- are on it currently?
- Let's see.

13:43.831 --> 13:45.331
Uh, some are on chemo.

13:45.332 --> 13:48.334
Others have blood
disorders or on dialysis.

13:48.335 --> 13:50.335
I'd say 200.

13:50.336 --> 13:52.971
We'd like to see their records.

13:52.972 --> 13:54.407
For that you need to submit a request

13:54.408 --> 13:56.008
to the Institutional Review Board.

13:56.009 --> 13:57.442
The IRB takes weeks.

13:57.443 --> 13:59.311
Months, with Red Rock in charge.

13:59.312 --> 14:01.013
Any way you can help us get it faster?

14:01.014 --> 14:02.914
Hospitals don't like to share data.

14:02.915 --> 14:04.984
Not even with their own staff.

14:04.985 --> 14:07.720
Last year, I put in a request
to find out the infection rates

14:07.721 --> 14:09.355
- in my department.
- And how long did it take

14:09.356 --> 14:12.327
- for you to hear back?
- I'm still waiting.

14:16.326 --> 14:18.063
I swear, I'm not trying to be bossy.

14:18.064 --> 14:20.233
I just want to help you
with your birth plan.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.433
That's why I'm here.

14:21.434 --> 14:22.902
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.236
Everyone, listen up.

14:24.237 --> 14:25.649
You must be Adaku.

14:25.650 --> 14:27.407
I hear you're quite the world traveler.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.908
- I prepped them.
- Of course you did.

14:29.909 --> 14:31.913
This is from all of us.

14:37.049 --> 14:38.951
This is incredible.

14:38.952 --> 14:41.048
I'm gonna cry.

14:41.049 --> 14:43.040
Does everyone get this treatment?

14:43.041 --> 14:44.389
You're not everyone.

14:44.390 --> 14:46.926
- Just remember, I'm in charge.
- Of course.

14:46.927 --> 14:49.228
And you have many choices to make today.

14:49.229 --> 14:51.464
Thank you.

14:51.465 --> 14:53.465
Thanks, guys.

14:53.466 --> 14:55.567
Okay, so where are we going now?

14:55.568 --> 14:57.290
Okay, so this is where
you're gonna have the baby.

14:57.291 --> 15:00.363
Okay.

15:00.364 --> 15:03.543
What did the fish say
when he swam into the wall?

15:04.912 --> 15:06.879
Dam!

15:06.880 --> 15:09.548
Help your old man out, son.

15:09.549 --> 15:11.283
Could have laughed just once.

15:11.284 --> 15:12.951
I could, but it would be fake, Dad.

15:12.952 --> 15:15.923
But in my heart, I
would receive it as real.

15:16.957 --> 15:20.258
Yee... look at him.

15:20.259 --> 15:22.427
- Something is not right.
- I know.

15:22.428 --> 15:24.730
My kung pao shrimp has
made grown men weep,

15:24.731 --> 15:26.398
and he hasn't touched a bite.

15:26.399 --> 15:28.734
All right, come clean, son. Did you

15:28.735 --> 15:31.072
get a girl pregnant?

15:32.272 --> 15:35.410
I found my birth parents.

15:40.313 --> 15:42.949
How? The records were closed.

15:42.950 --> 15:46.185
They didn't tell us
anything about who they were.

15:46.186 --> 15:48.521
- If we'd have known, we would've told you.
- I know.

15:48.522 --> 15:50.822
But they came looking for me.

15:50.823 --> 15:52.825
At least, my biological father did.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.627
Dude just showed up at the hospital.

15:54.628 --> 15:57.263
Tell us everything. What was he like?

15:57.264 --> 15:58.967
No sense of humor, like you?

15:58.968 --> 16:00.199
Well, he's stubborn.

16:00.200 --> 16:03.034
He's melodramatic, and he's opinionated.

16:03.035 --> 16:04.838
So, no, he's nothing like me.

16:15.515 --> 16:18.116
Hey. Any word on the pilot?

16:18.117 --> 16:20.119
NTSB isn't releasing any names.

16:20.120 --> 16:22.488
We don't know for sure your
patient crashed the plane.

16:22.489 --> 16:24.690
Same airline, same route.

16:24.691 --> 16:26.491
Too much of a coincidence.

16:26.492 --> 16:27.859
Hey, you didn't crash the plane.

16:27.860 --> 16:29.829
If he did cause this, it's on him.

16:29.830 --> 16:32.365
One man is dead. Maybe more.

16:33.533 --> 16:36.502
Every doctor has a patient in their past

16:36.503 --> 16:39.404
they want to go back to and
treat in a different way.

16:39.405 --> 16:42.475
Focus on the ones who
need you right now.

16:48.484 --> 16:50.208
So I took him into surgery.

16:50.209 --> 16:51.917
You operated on your birth father?

16:51.918 --> 16:52.918
I saved the dude's life.

16:52.919 --> 16:54.587
Ah.

16:54.588 --> 16:56.656
That must've really impressed the man.

16:56.657 --> 16:58.390
He must really want
to get to know you now.

16:58.391 --> 16:59.769
Well, that's not gonna happen.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.295
But what about your birth mother?

17:01.296 --> 17:03.320
I didn't meet her.

17:03.321 --> 17:05.324
And I don't plan to.

17:07.601 --> 17:11.503
Look, you are the only
parents that I know.

17:11.505 --> 17:15.073
Everything that I am, everything
that I've accomplished,

17:15.074 --> 17:17.077
I owe to both of you.

17:28.921 --> 17:31.023
Ah.

17:31.024 --> 17:33.527
Here we go.

17:35.637 --> 17:39.532
"I cannot help you,
for I am just a cookie"?

17:42.401 --> 17:43.969
Oh, th-this you laugh at.

17:43.970 --> 17:46.138
It's true.

17:46.139 --> 17:47.372
This is not even a fortune.

17:47.373 --> 17:48.615
Well, take it up with the owner.

17:48.616 --> 17:50.318
- Oh, I will.
- Mm.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.784
You okay, Ma?

17:56.116 --> 17:57.451
I'm okay.

18:01.921 --> 18:03.723
Grayson, do you believe in fate?

18:03.724 --> 18:06.060
I do believe I was born
to do this job, sir.

18:07.427 --> 18:09.395
Passengers at the front of the plane

18:09.396 --> 18:11.330
didn't fare so well when it crashed.

18:11.331 --> 18:13.099
Had I been seated in first class

18:13.100 --> 18:14.667
instead of coach, I might've been hurt.

18:14.668 --> 18:16.334
It's because of your mistake

18:16.335 --> 18:18.504
that I was able to
help people to safety.

18:18.505 --> 18:20.808
People are saying you're
the Sully of Atlanta.

18:23.243 --> 18:25.511
Now, we both got lucky.

18:25.512 --> 18:27.580
Because if you ever
seat me in coach again,

18:27.581 --> 18:28.916
you're fired.

18:33.675 --> 18:36.034
This poor guy was seated next
to me. I've called his wife,

18:36.035 --> 18:37.237
but she's not here yet.

18:38.425 --> 18:40.597
Cervical spinal damage and nerve injury.

18:40.598 --> 18:42.360
Yeah. We got to stop the bleeding first.

18:42.361 --> 18:43.928
By stabilizing the bones?

18:43.929 --> 18:46.498
Yeah, and removing the spleen.
The nerve repair can wait.

18:46.499 --> 18:48.634
It can, if you want him to
lose all neurological function.

18:48.635 --> 18:50.636
Look at these injuries.

18:50.637 --> 18:52.772
- He's far too unstable to fix everything.
- Well, yeah.

18:52.773 --> 18:53.975
So we prioritize.

18:55.374 --> 18:56.809
You good?

18:56.810 --> 18:58.708
Yeah. You should start

18:58.709 --> 19:00.279
on the nerves that are most at risk,

19:00.280 --> 19:02.859
and then I'll control the
hemorrhage from his spleen.

19:02.860 --> 19:04.884
I'll stabilize the pelvic fractures

19:04.885 --> 19:06.686
and ex fix arms and legs.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.286
Yeah. We'll just get him back to the ICU

19:08.287 --> 19:10.490
until he's stable enough for another go.

19:11.691 --> 19:12.692
Oh!

19:12.693 --> 19:14.462
Randolph!

19:15.361 --> 19:16.661
Are you all right?

19:18.331 --> 19:19.634
No.

19:25.663 --> 19:28.163
_

19:29.752 --> 19:31.985
I think filling out that IRB application

19:31.986 --> 19:33.288
gave me carpal tunnel.

19:33.289 --> 19:35.423
Red Rock hopes people tire out.

19:35.424 --> 19:39.293
Well, it's in, so now we wait.

19:39.294 --> 19:41.930
Patients are on hemopleatin right now.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.499
One click

19:44.500 --> 19:47.604
is all it takes to cut
through the red tape.

19:49.792 --> 19:51.650
If I break the glass,

19:51.651 --> 19:53.241
we get immediate access to the records

19:53.242 --> 19:54.408
of any patient on the drug.

19:54.409 --> 19:56.010
Conrad, if you break the glass,

19:56.011 --> 19:58.245
your name is recorded on
those charts permanently.

19:58.246 --> 19:59.814
You could be fired for
accessing medical records

19:59.815 --> 20:01.281
for patients that aren't yours.

20:01.282 --> 20:03.331
If anyone notices.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.520
Well, maybe they don't now, but someday.

20:05.521 --> 20:07.120
Do you really want that hanging over you

20:07.121 --> 20:08.624
the rest of your career?

20:09.536 --> 20:11.336
And if we can't get the
answers any other way?

20:12.493 --> 20:13.495
Then I'll break it.

20:14.530 --> 20:16.210
- I won't let you.
- Well, I won't let you.

20:17.198 --> 20:18.433
But we're not there yet. Come on,

20:18.434 --> 20:20.702
let's explore all of
our other options first.

20:20.703 --> 20:21.935
All right.

20:21.936 --> 20:23.106
Come on.

20:24.940 --> 20:26.273
- Yeah.
- I knew we'd feel something.

20:26.274 --> 20:27.808
- Here?
- No. No.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.479
- What about here?
- Yeah. Yep. Felt it.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.303
Left paralumbar tenderness right there.

20:31.304 --> 20:32.773
You're seeing what I'm seeing.

20:33.844 --> 20:35.069
Yeah, I wish I wasn't.

20:35.070 --> 20:38.028
- Care to share?
- You have a herniated disc.

20:39.288 --> 20:41.780
A disc is bulging out from...

20:41.781 --> 20:44.224
Yeah. No. I know what
a herniated disc is.

20:44.225 --> 20:47.528
It may be pressuring the L5 nerve root,

20:47.529 --> 20:50.530
and causing nerve impingement
and radicular symptoms.

20:50.531 --> 20:52.165
We can give you some anti-inflammatories

20:52.166 --> 20:53.401
to help get you through the day.

20:53.402 --> 20:55.172
And something stronger if you need it.

20:55.173 --> 20:56.887
I think our next step is clear.

20:56.888 --> 20:58.373
- You need physical therapy.
- I'll perform a discectomy.

20:58.374 --> 21:00.241
Surgery? You're not serious.

21:00.242 --> 21:01.876
With a discectomy and fusion,

21:01.877 --> 21:03.578
you have a better chance
at a quick recovery.

21:03.579 --> 21:05.011
And you can avoid nerve injury.

21:05.012 --> 21:07.347
Head-to-head trials show
that spinal fusion surgery

21:07.348 --> 21:09.606
has a success rate of barely 35%.

21:09.607 --> 21:11.712
Even successful patients often end up

21:11.713 --> 21:13.553
- on pain killers for years.
- Well, those stats

21:13.554 --> 21:15.198
are national averages.

21:15.199 --> 21:17.858
I'm above average. In fact,
my success rate is phenomenal.

21:17.859 --> 21:19.327
That's an easy claim to make

21:19.328 --> 21:21.229
when most hospitals aren't required

21:21.230 --> 21:23.030
to publish their surgical outcomes.

21:23.031 --> 21:24.331
Okay, well, talk to my patients.

21:24.332 --> 21:25.732
You can find them on golf courses,

21:25.733 --> 21:27.367
running marathons, not popping pills.

21:27.368 --> 21:28.869
Surgery seems aggressive.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.497
After all, the injury was only today.

21:30.498 --> 21:31.873
I have no perceptible nerve...

21:31.874 --> 21:34.241
- perceptible nerve damage.
- Yeah, well, even without

21:34.242 --> 21:36.243
the nerve damage, PT takes a long time.

21:36.244 --> 21:39.113
We're talking no sailing, no golfing...

21:39.114 --> 21:40.116
no sex.

21:41.849 --> 21:43.618
Yeah, and how long?

21:44.712 --> 21:46.915
What do you want to do, Randolph?

21:48.690 --> 21:50.290
So...

21:50.291 --> 21:52.292
do you want music for the labor?

21:52.293 --> 21:54.295
I want to start off with some Lizzo.

21:54.296 --> 21:56.297
- Mm-hmm.
- Talking Heads for the big finish.

21:56.298 --> 21:57.397
I like it.

21:57.398 --> 21:59.032
What about, um...

21:59.033 --> 22:00.434
birthing positions?

22:00.435 --> 22:02.537
We can have an exercise ball,

22:02.538 --> 22:05.606
a sling or a birthing stool.

22:05.607 --> 22:07.643
- Yes.
- Oh, we'll have all three on the day.

22:07.644 --> 22:10.243
- You're doing great so far.
- You know, there's, um...

22:10.244 --> 22:11.913
there's another decision

22:11.914 --> 22:13.915
I already gave a lot of thought to.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.917
Mina Okafor,

22:16.918 --> 22:19.587
I want you to be my baby's godmother.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.789
- Godmother?
- I'm cancer-free now,

22:21.790 --> 22:24.491
but we both know that that could change.

22:24.492 --> 22:27.728
If anything happens to me, I
want my baby to have a strong,

22:27.729 --> 22:29.564
brilliant Nigerian woman

22:29.565 --> 22:31.768
to show them the way.

22:42.977 --> 22:45.078
Okay, how can I help?

22:45.079 --> 22:46.113
Leave.

22:54.857 --> 22:57.858
Your blood work shows your
kidneys are severely damaged.

22:57.859 --> 23:00.524
And with your abnormal
EKG, we're seeing signs

23:00.525 --> 23:02.049
of cardiac injury.

23:02.050 --> 23:03.775
All from the crash?

23:03.776 --> 23:05.976
Your kidney damage is from years

23:05.977 --> 23:08.301
of untreated high blood pressure,

23:08.302 --> 23:09.636
but the stress of the crash

23:09.637 --> 23:11.305
raised your blood pressure even more,

23:11.306 --> 23:12.772
and now...

23:12.773 --> 23:15.643
you are at risk for
further organ damage.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.944
It's a hypertensive emergency, Susan.

23:17.945 --> 23:20.181
We need to transfer you to the ICU.

23:20.182 --> 23:21.715
The ICU? For how long?

23:21.716 --> 23:23.518
We'll know more in a couple days.

23:23.519 --> 23:25.777
But we need to get your
blood pressure under control.

23:25.778 --> 23:28.155
No. I have to get back
to work. I have lived

23:28.156 --> 23:30.057
with high blood pressure
my entire adult life.

23:30.058 --> 23:31.959
- This is...
- This is much more complicated

23:31.960 --> 23:33.661
than just high blood pressure.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.663
We need to prevent irreversible damage

23:35.664 --> 23:37.666
to your organs.

23:39.667 --> 23:41.702
So what?

23:41.703 --> 23:43.905
I'm sleeping my life away anyway.

23:43.906 --> 23:45.705
And there is no cure.

23:45.706 --> 23:48.308
You can't change that.

23:48.309 --> 23:49.911
My life is what it is.

23:49.912 --> 23:52.256
So... I might as well at least make sure

23:52.257 --> 23:53.747
that I don't lose my job.

23:53.748 --> 23:55.317
Excuse me.

23:56.084 --> 23:57.518
Susan.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.319
I don't think you understand.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.357
If you leave, you could die.

24:06.194 --> 24:08.164
Now do we understand each other?

24:13.367 --> 24:15.235
Call security. We
can't let Susan Mitchka

24:15.236 --> 24:16.369
in bay three leave.

24:16.370 --> 24:17.704
What are you doing?

24:17.705 --> 24:19.211
I'm putting Susan on a medical hold.

24:19.212 --> 24:21.442
I think she has
hypertensive encephalopathy,

24:21.443 --> 24:23.411
and she lacks the
capacity to make decisions.

24:23.412 --> 24:24.433
Hang on a minute.

24:24.434 --> 24:26.079
She can make decisions just fine.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.782
She's not in the right state of mind.

24:28.849 --> 24:30.550
This isn't about her.

24:30.551 --> 24:32.420
It's about the pilot.

24:32.421 --> 24:34.588
This is not the same thing.

24:34.589 --> 24:36.757
His drinking put other people in danger.

24:36.758 --> 24:38.792
- She needs treatment.
- Yes.

24:38.793 --> 24:42.530
But the decision only affects her.

24:42.531 --> 24:44.764
She wants to leave
against medical advice,

24:44.765 --> 24:47.269
it's her choice, not ours.

24:49.538 --> 24:51.973
- Prepare her paperwork.
- Yes, Doctor.

24:53.892 --> 24:56.895
I'm signing myself out
against medical advice.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.999
This is all very dramatic.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.600
After we get your BP sorted
out, we can try to get

25:03.601 --> 25:05.770
- your narcolepsy under control.
- You don't get it.

25:05.771 --> 25:07.704
I've seen every specialist.

25:07.705 --> 25:09.217
I've tried every medicine.

25:09.218 --> 25:10.274
Nothing works for me.

25:10.275 --> 25:13.245
So save your effort for
someone you can actually help.

25:20.652 --> 25:22.654
You seeing what I'm seeing?

25:22.655 --> 25:24.356
You don't think it could be?

25:24.357 --> 25:25.456
Only one way to find out.

25:25.457 --> 25:26.858
Hey, Susan.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.927
Anyone ever tell you
you walk kind of funny?

25:28.928 --> 25:31.455
Insult patients who leave.
What kind of hospital is this?

25:31.456 --> 25:32.664
Your CT was normal,

25:32.665 --> 25:34.366
but I think all your
doctors missed something.

25:34.367 --> 25:37.002
I'd like to do an MRI of
your brain before you go.

25:37.003 --> 25:39.436
- You're kidding.
- Hey, I get it.

25:39.437 --> 25:41.473
You don't think things will ever change.

25:41.474 --> 25:44.641
You've spent your whole
life just trying to get by.

25:44.642 --> 25:47.212
I can't.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.316
I can't hope anymore.

25:50.949 --> 25:52.550
I am fresh out.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.120
We're not.

25:55.620 --> 25:59.325
I think we can help you,
but you got to trust us.

26:04.362 --> 26:07.197
- We just need two minutes.
- I don't have two seconds.

26:07.198 --> 26:09.234
We've got a female patient, 30s,

26:09.235 --> 26:11.302
diagnosed with narcolepsy as a teenager.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.930
Hypertensive emergency
we thought was due

26:13.931 --> 26:16.041
to med-noncompliance and the crash.

26:16.042 --> 26:19.644
She has a wide, staggering gait
indicative of cerebellar ataxia.

26:19.645 --> 26:21.311
Because she doesn't
actually have narcolepsy.

26:21.312 --> 26:22.558
She was misdiagnosed.

26:22.559 --> 26:24.584
What she really has is
central sleep apnea,

26:24.585 --> 26:27.052
caused by a Chiari malformation.

26:27.053 --> 26:28.686
She needs you to operate.

26:28.687 --> 26:30.254
I'm booked five weeks out.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.257
She's got gold-plated insurance.

26:35.326 --> 26:37.361
Okay, I get it.

26:37.362 --> 26:40.092
So you guys think I'm some Red Rock tool

26:40.093 --> 26:41.500
who only cares about the money.

26:42.901 --> 26:44.535
I could have gone to any hospital

26:44.536 --> 26:46.204
in the country, gentlemen.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.941
I chose Chastain because
I saw the opportunity

26:48.942 --> 26:50.442
to help as many people as possible,

26:50.443 --> 26:52.744
with a staff who would support me,

26:52.745 --> 26:55.346
or at least stay out of my way.

26:55.347 --> 26:58.049
Coming at me like this
is not how it's done.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.583
Your patient needs my help,

26:59.584 --> 27:01.953
I will operate on her because I care,

27:01.954 --> 27:03.956
not because she can pay.

27:07.892 --> 27:09.895
Maybe we misjudged him.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.304
Check her insurance.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.281
I'm a surgical resident,

27:23.282 --> 27:25.209
which means I work 80 hours a week,

27:25.210 --> 27:28.312
but it's more like 120 with
all the studying and prep.

27:28.313 --> 27:32.050
I arrive by 4:30 a.m.,
leave no earlier than 7:00.

27:32.051 --> 27:34.119
I'm on call every three days.

27:34.120 --> 27:37.238
Work Saturday or Sunday or both.

27:37.239 --> 27:39.389
And I have two more
years left of residency,

27:39.390 --> 27:41.759
followed by at least another
few years of fellowship,

27:41.760 --> 27:44.294
during which my schedule
will only get worse.

27:44.295 --> 27:46.427
- Uh...
- Do you know what the salary

27:46.428 --> 27:47.498
for a surgical resident is?

27:47.499 --> 27:49.000
- Ah, there's more.
- Yes.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.734
$55,000 a year.

27:50.735 --> 27:54.253
Even if I had time, I
can't afford childcare.

27:54.254 --> 27:55.305
Is that all?

27:55.306 --> 27:58.176
And I only like children
that belong to other people.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.244
Okay, so...

28:00.245 --> 28:01.779
what you're saying is, you...

28:01.780 --> 28:03.814
don't want to be my baby's godmother.

28:03.815 --> 28:06.350
I'm saying I'm the wrong choice.

28:06.351 --> 28:08.369
I will hold your hand at ultrasounds,

28:08.370 --> 28:10.829
shop for baby clothes, be
with you every step of the way.

28:10.830 --> 28:12.834
- Unless I die.
- I will do everything in my power

28:12.835 --> 28:15.159
- to make sure you don't.
- Got it.

28:15.160 --> 28:18.196
So I have four choices for pain relief,

28:18.197 --> 28:19.930
two for fetal monitoring.

28:19.931 --> 28:22.758
I can choose between membrane stripping

28:22.759 --> 28:25.703
or Pitocin or artificial rupture.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.505
But who will take care
of my baby if I'm gone?

28:28.506 --> 28:31.009
That choice I do not get to make.

28:31.010 --> 28:33.038
I'll help you find someone else.

28:33.039 --> 28:36.347
Adaku, I don't understand why
this is so upsetting to you.

28:36.348 --> 28:38.815
Because it's the only thing
that we've talked about today

28:38.816 --> 28:40.620
that actually matters to me.

28:48.127 --> 28:50.227
Pelvic fixation complete.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.230
- Rongeur.
- Rongeur.

28:52.363 --> 28:53.665
I'll be quick.

28:53.666 --> 28:55.300
I can insert the pins while I wait.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.302
Drill.

29:07.045 --> 29:08.646
Watch your alignment, Dr. Voss,

29:08.647 --> 29:10.314
or your radial shaft will be gapped.

29:10.315 --> 29:12.017
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

29:13.151 --> 29:15.086
Bleeding controlled.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.155
Applying the abdominal vacuum

29:17.156 --> 29:19.224
so I can get him back up to the ICU.

29:19.225 --> 29:21.394
I'm right behind you.

29:23.395 --> 29:24.829
Starting the graft now.

29:24.830 --> 29:28.020
Oh? Already?

29:28.021 --> 29:30.046
- Got someplace to be?
- Speed and performance

29:30.047 --> 29:31.902
can go hand in hand.

29:31.903 --> 29:32.936
What do you drive?

29:32.937 --> 29:34.938
Jerry is a person, not a car.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.241
If I didn't move this fast,

29:36.242 --> 29:37.459
this person would lose

29:37.460 --> 29:38.816
all nerve function in his arm.

29:38.817 --> 29:40.844
Jerry can't move his
arms if he has no arms.

29:40.845 --> 29:42.112
Get height restoration

29:42.113 --> 29:44.995
and page me if there's any surprises.

29:44.996 --> 29:46.553
Wait, you're not leaving

29:46.554 --> 29:48.697
this man's nerve
function to a third-year.

29:48.698 --> 29:50.055
Of course. Hanna's extraordinary.

29:50.056 --> 29:52.733
She may be, but that's
not how we do things here.

29:52.734 --> 29:55.126
Now, get back there and do your job.

29:59.143 --> 30:01.168
Uh... his pelvis is filling with blood.

30:01.169 --> 30:03.358
- I thought we were about to close.
- No, the packing

30:03.359 --> 30:05.402
must have stretched the
vessels. I also repaired

30:05.403 --> 30:06.870
- a partial tear up here earlier.
- Corona mortis.

30:06.871 --> 30:09.744
- It's the crown of death.
- Bleeding from the connection

30:09.745 --> 30:11.941
between the obturator
and iliac arteries.

30:11.942 --> 30:13.234
- It's usually fatal.
- Bovie.

30:13.235 --> 30:14.417
- Lap.
- Retractors to me.

30:14.418 --> 30:16.458
- We need to control this now.
- Lap suction.

30:17.315 --> 30:20.652
Lap. Lap.

30:25.853 --> 30:28.153
- You must be Jerry's wife.
- Yes.

30:28.154 --> 30:29.822
I'm Dr. Bell.

30:29.823 --> 30:33.068
During the surgery, your
husband had significant bleeding.

30:33.069 --> 30:34.527
Our surgeons managed to stop it,

30:34.528 --> 30:36.696
but his blood pressure
dropped for a long time.

30:36.697 --> 30:38.931
- Is he okay?
- Well, he's being moved to the ICU now.

30:38.932 --> 30:40.133
He's alive.

30:40.134 --> 30:41.534
But, uh...

30:41.535 --> 30:43.870
we just don't know
if he's gonna wake up.

30:43.871 --> 30:46.107
What?

30:47.970 --> 30:49.662
You know, actually, I was...

30:49.663 --> 30:52.367
I was sitting beside your
husband on the flight.

30:53.646 --> 30:55.616
He wouldn't stop talking about you.

30:59.486 --> 31:01.821
I hit "ignore".

31:01.822 --> 31:04.323
He called me.

31:04.324 --> 31:07.527
I was at the store and I hit "ignore".

31:07.528 --> 31:10.131
Because once Jerry gets going...

31:12.332 --> 31:14.369
I hit "ignore".

31:16.502 --> 31:19.005
Well, I'll let you know
as soon as you can see him.

31:19.006 --> 31:21.875
Thank you.

31:28.082 --> 31:30.083
- Hey.
- Hi.

31:30.084 --> 31:32.384
How long before your next surgery?

31:32.385 --> 31:34.126
- About 20 minutes.
- Oh, good.

31:34.127 --> 31:35.930
Come, please sit with me.

31:38.659 --> 31:41.326
What's up?

31:41.327 --> 31:44.197
You know, your dad always
wanted to adopt a kid.

31:44.198 --> 31:46.431
I took a little more convincing.

31:46.432 --> 31:48.563
I was scared.

31:48.564 --> 31:50.054
That's funny, I...

31:50.055 --> 31:51.889
You?

31:51.890 --> 31:54.826
I can't imagine you
being scared of anything.

31:54.827 --> 31:58.096
Yeah. I was worried that
we wouldn't be enough,

31:58.097 --> 31:59.666
that we were being selfish.

32:00.798 --> 32:03.456
Taking a child who might
be better off with people

32:03.457 --> 32:05.881
who would give them
everything they needed.

32:06.994 --> 32:09.662
Okay, something tells me you
didn't drive from Buckhead

32:09.663 --> 32:12.698
- to tell me that.
- I came here to tell you that I don't think

32:12.699 --> 32:15.168
you're being honest with us or yourself.

32:15.169 --> 32:17.938
- Come on, Ma.
- No, you come on, AJ.

32:17.939 --> 32:20.105
You are my son, and I know you.

32:20.106 --> 32:22.175
And I also know that one day,

32:22.176 --> 32:24.543
you will want to meet
your biological mother.

32:24.544 --> 32:27.013
That woman is a stranger
who threw me away.

32:27.014 --> 32:28.949
I do not want to meet her.

32:30.517 --> 32:32.518
Because you're scared.

32:32.519 --> 32:34.620
That she won't be enough for you,

32:34.621 --> 32:36.814
or that you won't be enough for her.

32:36.815 --> 32:40.062
And you're also scared that
she might hurt you again.

32:40.794 --> 32:42.797
Listen.

32:44.007 --> 32:45.966
You won't know what you'll find

32:45.967 --> 32:48.001
when you walk through their door,

32:48.002 --> 32:51.123
but you will know
exactly what you'll find

32:51.124 --> 32:52.960
when you walk back through ours.

32:54.074 --> 32:56.743
No matter what, we will
always be here for you.

32:56.744 --> 32:58.713
So when you're ready...

33:00.348 --> 33:02.217
... you go see her, my son.

33:05.887 --> 33:08.590
But I got a few ground rules.

33:10.757 --> 33:13.361
Birthdays and holidays are mine.

33:14.829 --> 33:16.595
You got it.

33:16.596 --> 33:19.867
And every other day in between.

33:23.070 --> 33:24.905
You got it.

33:34.582 --> 33:37.017
How did it go with the parents?

33:38.451 --> 33:39.919
Better than I could have imagined.

33:39.920 --> 33:43.547
You know, my mother
actually encouraged me

33:43.548 --> 33:44.794
to meet my biological mother.

33:45.725 --> 33:46.793
Will you?

33:46.794 --> 33:48.794
I don't know.

33:48.795 --> 33:50.698
But now I know I can.

33:52.433 --> 33:54.401
They're great people.

33:54.402 --> 33:57.202
Mina, they are amazing people.

33:57.203 --> 33:59.805
Even when they don't know
what they're saying yes to,

33:59.806 --> 34:02.944
they still put me
first, even if it hurts.

34:04.145 --> 34:06.146
That's family.

34:06.147 --> 34:09.985
The ones who sacrifice
for you out of love.

34:11.319 --> 34:12.818
Who make the difficult decisions.

34:12.819 --> 34:15.089
Even if they have every
reason to run away.

34:16.623 --> 34:19.426
I hope I can be the
kind of parent they are.

34:28.134 --> 34:30.138
How'd it go with Adaku?

34:31.806 --> 34:34.407
It didn't.

34:34.408 --> 34:36.411
And now I think I understand why.

34:44.185 --> 34:45.751
How's Susan?

34:45.752 --> 34:48.755
Dr. Cain is retrieving the patch now.

34:48.755 --> 34:50.091
She should be okay.

34:51.926 --> 34:55.360
And what about you?

34:55.362 --> 34:58.465
- Long day.
- Ah.

34:58.466 --> 35:00.767
Every doctor has them.

35:00.768 --> 35:02.869
And we go home,

35:02.870 --> 35:04.873
we learn from our mistakes.

35:06.107 --> 35:08.509
The thing is... I didn't make one.

35:09.944 --> 35:12.278
I was right not to report that pilot.

35:12.279 --> 35:14.314
Wrong.

35:14.315 --> 35:16.383
Drunk pilots should not be flying.

35:16.384 --> 35:17.886
Period.

35:21.187 --> 35:23.189
62 injured.

35:23.190 --> 35:25.057
14 critical.

35:25.058 --> 35:27.059
Do I feel bad about what happened?

35:27.060 --> 35:28.727
Of course I do.

35:28.728 --> 35:31.064
But patients need to know
that when they come to us,

35:31.065 --> 35:33.066
we will keep their medical
information private,

35:33.067 --> 35:34.901
good or bad.

35:34.902 --> 35:36.403
Once we lose that trust,

35:36.404 --> 35:38.505
we can't help anyone,
and people will die.

35:38.506 --> 35:40.140
People did die because of your choice.

35:40.141 --> 35:42.344
- How do you not see that?
- I took an oath.

35:43.511 --> 35:45.345
I get that you would have
made a different choice.

35:45.346 --> 35:46.813
- The right one.
- For you.

35:46.814 --> 35:49.317
But I don't want to be
the kind of doctor you are.

35:50.350 --> 35:52.052
Well...

35:52.053 --> 35:54.321
clearly, I've been wasting your time.

36:01.392 --> 36:05.228
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:05.229 --> 36:07.065
Uh... what happened?

36:07.066 --> 36:09.567
- They fixed you.
- Well, not yet.

36:09.568 --> 36:11.719
In a few days, we'll
complete your reconstruction,

36:11.720 --> 36:13.723
but we will get you there.

36:15.106 --> 36:17.107
I've never seen a hospital like this.

36:17.108 --> 36:19.210
Where exactly are we?

36:19.211 --> 36:20.835
Welcome to First Class.

36:20.836 --> 36:22.547
Oh.

36:22.548 --> 36:25.216
How long can we stay?

36:25.217 --> 36:26.951
Oh.

36:26.952 --> 36:30.388
You really need to deal
with that back, Dr. Bell.

36:30.389 --> 36:33.428
I threw my back out
pole dancing last year,

36:33.429 --> 36:35.755
and it was no fun.

36:35.756 --> 36:38.057
- Mm.
- For you.

36:41.928 --> 36:43.929
Hey.

36:43.930 --> 36:45.898
How do you feel?

36:45.899 --> 36:48.668
Awake.

36:48.669 --> 36:50.739
- Oh.
- Well, let's have a look.

36:52.906 --> 36:55.842
Dr. Cain enlarged the covering
over the back of your brain.

36:55.843 --> 36:57.744
This will relieve the pressure

36:57.745 --> 36:59.232
that was causing your sleep apnea.

36:59.233 --> 37:02.349
- Just like that, huh?
- Just like that.

37:02.350 --> 37:04.617
Just like that.

37:04.618 --> 37:06.753
And the surgery cured
your blood pressure.

37:06.754 --> 37:09.822
This means I don't have
to work in sales anymore.

37:09.823 --> 37:11.825
I've never quit a job before.

37:14.294 --> 37:16.161
But it's up to you now.

37:18.165 --> 37:20.268
You got choices.

37:22.970 --> 37:24.973
Choices.

37:25.939 --> 37:27.942
Oh, I like the sound of that.

37:29.442 --> 37:31.344
Thank you.

37:46.454 --> 37:48.688
So dramatic, Randolph.

37:48.689 --> 37:51.357
This is me taking your advice.

37:51.358 --> 37:52.859
Yeah, it's a good look on you.

37:52.860 --> 37:54.293
Well, if it doesn't
work in a few weeks...

37:54.294 --> 37:57.196
You won't need surgery if you
do your exercises every day.

37:57.197 --> 37:59.266
Don't be one of those
patients who forgets.

37:59.267 --> 38:00.567
Yeah, well, I have a feel...

38:00.568 --> 38:01.701
feeling you'll remind me.

38:01.702 --> 38:03.237
Just doing my job.

38:04.271 --> 38:07.040
Is this a job you've decided to stay in?

38:07.041 --> 38:09.442
'Cause you set up meetings
with other hospitals.

38:09.443 --> 38:10.911
I did.

38:10.912 --> 38:14.147
But I care about the
people here too much.

38:14.148 --> 38:17.618
And I'm not giving up on any of you.

38:17.619 --> 38:20.052
Oh.

38:20.053 --> 38:22.889
Work him hard.

38:22.890 --> 38:25.059
Oh.

38:35.169 --> 38:37.170
So I guess you're the Bell whisperer.

38:37.171 --> 38:39.438
Hardly.

38:39.439 --> 38:42.074
I don't think anyone's quite
figured out that man yet.

38:42.075 --> 38:43.676
You talked an educated doctor out

38:43.677 --> 38:46.013
of a proven medical intervention.

38:46.014 --> 38:49.348
Well, if Bell's mastered one
thing, it's self-preservation.

38:49.349 --> 38:51.451
Yes, and he also plays well with others,

38:51.452 --> 38:53.822
which is more than I can say for you.

38:55.155 --> 38:57.991
Don't ever speak to me
that way in the OR again.

38:57.992 --> 39:00.194
I should say the same to you.

39:00.195 --> 39:02.129
I can say whatever I want.

39:02.130 --> 39:03.964
That's the difference between a surgeon

39:03.965 --> 39:05.531
who bills $80 million a year like me,

39:05.532 --> 39:09.203
and one that bills... two.

39:26.787 --> 39:28.821
It's a good one.

39:28.822 --> 39:31.958
I'm reading the chapter on episiotomies.

39:31.959 --> 39:33.662
Yikes.

39:35.963 --> 39:39.132
I threw this whole godmother
thing at you fast, huh?

39:39.133 --> 39:41.637
I understand if you're
not comfortable with it.

39:42.836 --> 39:44.203
I thought about it.

39:44.204 --> 39:47.708
And?

39:47.709 --> 39:51.245
It's been... a long time

39:51.246 --> 39:54.513
since someone asked me
to sacrifice for family.

39:54.514 --> 39:57.484
I don't really have any left.

39:57.485 --> 39:59.153
We've both lost so much.

40:00.588 --> 40:03.357
But you became my
family a long time ago.

40:03.358 --> 40:06.592
And if my sister has a child,

40:06.593 --> 40:09.362
then that child becomes my family, too.

40:09.363 --> 40:12.199
No matter what.

40:12.200 --> 40:14.870
Are you saying you'll
be my baby's godmother?

40:18.514 --> 40:20.104
You said yes?

40:20.105 --> 40:21.564
I didn't have a choice.

40:21.565 --> 40:23.952
Women who've had triple
negative breast cancer

40:23.953 --> 40:26.413
have the highest recurrence
rates in the first three years.

40:26.414 --> 40:29.283
Not to mention the risk of
developing ovarian cancer.

40:29.284 --> 40:30.750
All right, so, what's your plan

40:30.751 --> 40:33.121
if Adaku's baby becomes
your responsibility?

40:34.188 --> 40:36.191
I don't have one.

40:39.093 --> 40:41.094
Good night, guys.

40:41.095 --> 40:43.931
Good night.

40:43.932 --> 40:45.399
Busy day?

40:45.400 --> 40:47.436
Yeah.

40:49.137 --> 40:51.139
Yeah, um...

40:53.707 --> 40:56.310
I thought about going
to AA like you said,

40:56.311 --> 40:58.210
but I ended up back at the hotel.

40:58.211 --> 41:01.214
There's a bar.

41:01.215 --> 41:04.083
And it was late, so,
when I got to the airport

41:04.084 --> 41:06.085
the next day, I was...

41:06.086 --> 41:08.090
I was still pretty buzzed.

41:11.726 --> 41:13.793
I was about to board

41:13.794 --> 41:15.764
when I heard the noise.

41:23.236 --> 41:25.173
This crash wasn't my fault.

41:26.240 --> 41:28.308
But the next one...

41:28.309 --> 41:30.479
it could be.

41:31.479 --> 41:33.482
I need help.

41:35.249 --> 41:37.516
I lost the pamphlet.

41:37.517 --> 41:40.088
We got hundreds. Come on.

41:42.789 --> 41:45.324
Spoke to Andrews.

41:45.325 --> 41:48.427
No more P.E. deaths today.

41:48.428 --> 41:50.464
Great.

41:50.465 --> 41:52.299
What about tomorrow?

41:52.300 --> 41:56.002
Making sure a drug is safe
shouldn't be this hard.

41:56.003 --> 41:59.873
If it is harming patients,
it's only gonna get harder.

41:59.874 --> 42:02.842
Red Rock, the pharmaceutical company...

42:02.843 --> 42:05.012
you ready to take these guys on?

42:08.515 --> 42:11.650
I keep thinking, what
would Jessie want me to do?

42:13.621 --> 42:16.989
She made a lot of bad choices, but...

42:16.990 --> 42:18.659
she was fearless.

42:20.128 --> 42:21.997
She always wanted the truth.

42:23.398 --> 42:26.132
We don't stop until we get it.

42:29.736 --> 42:31.673
My shift ends in a few hours.

42:33.807 --> 42:35.241
See you at home?

42:35.242 --> 42:37.244
I like the sound of that.

42:56.888 --> 42:58.888
